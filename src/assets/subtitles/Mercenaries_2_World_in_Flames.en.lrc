[00:00.79]Is it mercenary or mercenary?
[00:03.53]Is it M-E-R-C-E-N or C-A-N?
[00:07.39]Is it mercenary or mercenaries?
[00:13.36]Mercenary, right?
[00:20.06]Yeah, with an E. Had it right.
[00:25.48]No, no, no, no.
[00:26.02]Hold on.
[00:26.44]It's M...
[00:27.47]M-E-C... M-E-R-C-A-N?
[00:32.69]Whatever, I don't care.
[00:33.43]It's Merc... Mercenaries?
[00:36.51]Mercenary!
[00:39.53]No, it... My phone's not telling me it's wrong.
[00:43.19]I'm just tweeting it.
[00:47.29]Mercenaries.
[00:48.25]Alright, hello.
[00:50.91]Hi.
[00:51.31]Welcome, everybody.
[00:51.85]Welcome back.
[00:52.75]Hope you had a good weekend.
[00:55.18]Welcome back to the stream.
[00:58.85]Today, I guess you just heard it, we're going to be playing Mercenaries 2.
[01:02.17]There's a funny story about this one.
[01:07.88]This is on PC.
[01:09.92]Didn't want it to be on PC.
[01:11.36]I wanted it to be on PlayStation 3.
[01:14.44]But unfortunately, I couldn't get this game to get... I couldn't get my PlayStation 3 to get captured.
[01:22.53]I was trying to capture my PlayStation 3 and it wouldn't work anymore.
[01:26.66]I don't know what happened.
[01:27.20]We played the Olympics game like 12 days ago, right?
[01:30.65]Like last week?
[01:31.83]A week and a half ago?
[01:33.41]What happened?
[01:36.23]I don't know.
[01:36.69]I don't know what happened.
[01:38.89]I was trying to figure this out for like a fucking hour.
[01:40.69]I was supposed to start an hour ago.
[01:41.79]I was here ready to go.
[01:44.41]I don't know why I wouldn't get captured.
[01:45.86]It was... No, not the... I mean, I streamed from this exact setup 12 days ago.
[01:52.52]I didn't change anything.
[01:55.10]Was there a Windows update or like an OBS update within the last 10 days?
[02:03.35]Something got fucked up.
[02:04.87]Yes, it was.
[02:05.67]Okay.
[02:06.47]Of course.
[02:06.81]It was a PS3 update.
[02:15.48]It was a Windows update like 5 days ago.
[02:17.24]Okay.
[02:17.82]I think we may have found the culprit then.
[02:25.44]What are they even doing anymore?
[02:28.64]Can we just talk about this very briefly?
[02:30.94]What the fuck are they updating?
[02:33.18]What are they even doing?
[02:34.52]The operating system just works.
[02:38.04]Just fix... What else could you be adding?
[02:44.70]Okay, I understand security holes, right?
[02:47.27]Fix the security holes and fix the bugs.
[02:50.81]But I don't give a shit about any of the new features you add.
[02:55.22]You know, I've been sitting on the Windows, like, update.
[02:58.82]There's like a features.
[03:00.58]Windows features.
[03:02.30]Please install me.
[03:03.34]It's been like a year and a half.
[03:04.26]I'm like, no, fucking get out of here.
[03:05.26]I don't want you.
[03:12.87]I don't know what it adds.
[03:13.55]What does it add?
[03:14.05]Like, yeah.
[03:15.31]Let me see what it adds.
[03:16.45]I'm curious.
[03:19.61]I want to read it.
[03:22.37]And I'll tell you if any of these things are things that I would ever use.
[03:27.84]Okay, let's see.
[03:30.13]What does it got?
[03:30.69]Okay, learn more.
[03:35.17]Okay, this one.
[03:36.53]This is for, uh... Okay.
[03:40.11]Great news.
[03:41.85]What's new?
[03:43.11]Here we go.
[03:50.23]Alright.
[03:50.73]Troubleshooting.
[03:51.91]Wait, there's only a troubleshooting list.
[03:59.76]Hey guys, here's the new Windows update.
[04:01.80]Here's what it adds.
[04:02.76]It breaks everything, and here's a list of how you fix it when we break it.
[04:08.08]Windows 10 versions... Okay, Windows 10 versions 1909 and 1903 share a common core operating system and an identical set of system files.
[04:20.72]As a result, the new features in Windows 10 were included in the recent monthly quarterly update for Windows 10.
[04:26.36]But they're currently in a dormant state.
[04:29.04]These new features will remain dormant until they are turned on using an Enablement Package, which is a small quick-to-install master switch that simply activates Windows 10 not- What?
[04:44.05]Why do they have like a dormant... ancient creature that's being built into the Windows 10 update?
[04:49.67]I'm not gonna enable that.
[04:56.20]I don't want this Cthulhu fucking update on my computer.
[04:59.98]No, just fix the security bugs.
[05:10.05]Anyways.
[05:11.41]An Eldritch update.
[05:16.85]An Eldritch update.
[05:19.03]That's so perfect.
[05:19.85]I'm not enabling that.
[05:20.83]No, I don't want that.
[05:22.13]I don't want a dormant fucking Microsoft computer monster on here.
[05:27.06]And then they just, like, they turn it on one day and, like, break your computer?
[05:29.76]Why does there have to be a master switch?
[05:35.96]That feels like it shouldn't be there.
[05:38.60]It feels like they shouldn't, like, turn on a master switch.
[05:44.92]Alright, we're gonna play mercenaries too.
[05:46.36]Let's go.
[05:46.75]I already hear explosions.
[05:55.75]Okay, here we go.
[05:56.80]Can you see it?
[06:00.32]Does Jerma not know how Windows works?
[06:03.86]I know how Windows works.
[06:04.84]I just... I don't... I don't want all that shit.
[06:10.24]I don't know, everyone just says, dude, just use Linux.
[06:12.70]It's, okay, everything I ever hear about Linux or, like, any of the Linux operating systems, it's just, hey, it's just, like, way better.
[06:20.73]From my understanding, you've got Windows is, like, the Best Buy computer that you buy off the shelf and it has, like, fucking Norton 360 on it already, right?
[06:30.04]But Linux is like you built it yourself and there's no bullshit on it.
[06:33.04]Is that how I understand this?
[06:39.25]But the unfortunate thing is everything is made for the Best Buy computer.
[06:46.81]So a lot of times you have to have the Best Buy computer.
[06:53.25]I know I don't want to play online.
[07:01.04]Play online?
[07:01.98]Wait, I have to pick my character?
[07:03.16]Um, I can't see the other characters.
[07:11.62]Okay.
[07:12.91]Matthias Nilsson, Chris Jacobs, or Jennifer Mew.
[07:18.13]How do I see them?
[07:18.93]I want to see them.
[07:23.96]Oh, okay.
[07:26.86]Hmm.
[07:27.04]Hmm.
[07:40.20]Jennifer, duh.
[07:41.02]What do you mean, duh?
[07:49.55]I like the cigar.
[07:51.05]I do like the cigar.
[07:53.45]I'm a big cigar fan.
[07:55.29]I've never smoked one.
[07:58.05]Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer, Jennifer.
[07:59.61]Whoa!
[08:06.71]Alright, Jesus.
[08:12.64]But Chris has a cigar.
[08:13.88]Alright, it's done.
[08:20.00]Wait, runs faster?
[08:21.18]Hold on.
[08:22.42]Okay, which one of these guys has punches harder?
[08:27.73]Regenerates health faster.
[08:29.05]Carries more ammo.
[08:38.59]Alright, runs faster is... I feel like... Alright, that's probably pretty good.
[08:43.50]Jen only to her friends is the most expensive mercenary on Earth.
[08:47.78]If it seems like she focuses on money and nothing else, it's because she focuses on money and nothing else.
[08:52.04]Okay.
[08:54.04]Kind of a big fan so far.
[08:55.20]She finds it amusing that there are people dumb enough to think that anything else is important.
[09:05.31]Let's go.
[09:07.48]is there is this is this like a video game is it like a cut scene or is it just throw like grenades at stuff probably it's probably low but whatever I'll be quiet Jennifer good to see you again it has been a long time since the car
[09:31.20]I remember Dakar.
[09:32.44]I remember you leaving me to fight off an armored division all by myself.
[09:36.26]The money dried up.
[09:37.62]I cut my losses.
[09:39.26]You should have done the same.
[09:41.06]Oh, I got paid.
[09:42.46]I always get paid.
[09:43.50]I need your guns.
[09:45.30]No one sees the boss.
[09:46.78]I feel like this is a machinima made in The Sims.
[09:48.58]This is your friend?
[09:50.28]Jennifer, this is Ramon Solano.
[09:53.27]Mr. Solano is the richest man in Venezuela.
[09:56.39]I can tell we're going to get along perfectly.
[09:58.67]What's the contract?
[10:00.44]It is.
[10:00.88]Yeah, it is.
[10:01.68]It's made by EA.
[10:02.46]Oh shit, it is.
[10:03.18]I feel like I'm gonna really like this game.
[10:05.57]Is that the case?
[10:07.59]I've never played either of them.
[10:31.49]2008 cell phones?
[10:32.10]This is like an iPhone 4.
[10:33.06]You're literally coping.
[10:35.12]What?
[10:35.28]Oh, shit.
[10:35.56]Okay, here we go.
[10:58.52]Accelerate.

[11:07.81]What are those?
[11:10.13]Objective added.
[11:10.85]Land on the beach.
[11:11.61]Okay, but what buttons are those?
[11:13.61]Okay, it's obviously A. And then what is B?
[11:19.18]Brake?
[11:20.00]No, B is horn.
[11:25.22]Land on the beach.
[11:33.32]How do you exit?
[11:35.10]Wait, do you drive cars?
[11:37.36]Wait a second.
[11:40.67]Wait for a weapon delivery.
[11:42.91]Melee bash?
[11:44.25]Use melee bash to open crates.
[11:47.57]Is it punch?
[11:47.93]Oops.
[11:48.03]I already like it.
[11:48.71]I love it already.
[11:49.17]Okay, what's in here?
[11:50.03]There's nothing in there.
[11:51.09]Equip grenade launcher.
[12:04.80]How do I pick it up?
[12:06.33]Did I get it?
[12:06.73]I don't think I picked it up.
[12:16.65]Oh boy!
[12:17.71]This is not... I don't think this is a controller game.
[12:30.70]I don't think this is a controller game.
[12:33.48]Let me see.
[12:34.36]Why are there no ammo stores around here?
[12:36.20]How do I zoom in?
[12:39.26]There's got to be some ammo around here.
[12:42.70]I need to reload.
[12:44.14]Stop!
[12:44.48]I need to find some ammo.
[12:45.32]Okay, wait.
[12:46.48]Right mouse button doesn't zoom in?
[12:47.82]What the hell zooms in then?
[12:55.18]Shoot, reload.
[12:56.36]Why are you giving me Minecraft pictures?
[13:00.22]What's the button that I have to press?
[13:07.60]Zoom, switch weapons.
[13:09.02]Yeah, how?
[13:10.04]How do I do that?
[13:11.70]Q?
[13:13.38]Hold on.
[13:19.32]Okay.
[13:20.00]Mouse 1.
[13:21.32]Primary switch, tab.
[13:23.00]Reload is R. Secondary attack, mouse 2.
[13:26.90]Secondary switch is V. Melee attack, F.
[13:31.01]Use E, jump, space, crouch, C, binoculars, B, PDA, F1, look up, I, A, support, walk, switch.
[13:41.85]What's zoom in?
[13:44.92]Sprint is left shift.
[13:45.86]Okay, but what is the zoom in?
[13:49.48]Mouse 2.
[13:50.16]I'm pressing mouse 2.
[13:57.63]Wait, it's crouch?
[14:00.86]Sensitivity's gotta go way down, too.
[14:02.40]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[14:03.30]I like playing with the controller.
[14:04.32]Hold on.
[14:08.64]Joystick sensitivity.
[14:09.50]Here we are.
[14:09.90]I wanna play with the controller.
[14:10.62]I don't want a keyboard and mouse.
[14:11.60]I hate that.
[14:12.02]Alright, let's try that.
[14:13.64]Alright, that's way too slow, but you get the idea.
[14:22.85]Yeah, this is much better.
[14:34.88]That was not good.
[14:36.00]That was very bad.
[14:37.96]Oh, it's shot.
[14:43.64]Alright.
[14:45.55]Oh, okay.
[14:46.05]That's how you equip it.
[14:48.71]That's a little too low, though.
[14:50.11]Way too low.
[14:51.01]Way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way, way.
[14:54.95]I think that's going to be good.
[14:57.37]This game was wild as a kid.
[14:59.02]You played this as a kid?
[15:00.14]I need you to open your PDA so I can sync up your current GPS cord.
[15:06.12]Open PDA is the pause button.
[15:08.76]Is the select button.
[15:13.04]This is a great kids game.
[15:14.64]Um... I don't think I agree.
[15:17.94]Okay, destroy the gate.
[15:22.48]Thank god there's a fucking Fallout New Vegas map.
[15:25.74]Alright, what do I do?
[15:26.62]How do I blow it up?
[15:27.62]Go back to... That's how you switch weapons?
[15:37.24]Alright, let's go.
[15:41.14]Dude, you know what?
[15:41.92]Okay, my up and down sensitivity is crazy.
[15:46.58]Open support menu, use support item.
[16:01.59]Wait, satellite.
[16:02.77]Guided satellite, mom.
[16:04.91]One for free.
[16:06.82]How do I use it?
[16:09.52]Use support item.
[16:13.91]Oh, shit.
[16:18.13]Okay, over the target.
[16:19.09]Confirm.
[16:20.67]Confirm target.
[16:22.01]Do it!
[16:22.37]Go!
[16:22.63]Did I do it?
[16:24.97]Okay, there it is.
[16:31.00]Confirm target.
[16:33.04]Okay, got it.
[16:36.78]Oh, it's a mini-game.
[16:40.18]Oh, shit.
[16:40.56]Alright, run, run, run.
[16:41.40]Get out of here.
[16:50.39]I mean, let's be honest.
[16:51.97]You would do the same shit.
[16:53.41]It doesn't matter how, like, hard you think you are.
[16:56.07]If there's an explosion that far behind you, you're not gonna be like, Yeah!
[16:59.53]No, you're gonna be like, Jesus!
[17:03.73]I'm glad that that happened.
[17:11.56]Oh, fuck, look out.
[17:12.32]Alright, how do you sprint?
[17:15.46]How do you crouch?
[17:19.80]Okay, don't want to die in this tutorial.
[17:28.57]Uh, I have an idea.
[17:45.33]Got him!
[17:46.33]Did I get him?
[17:51.77]Your AK's freaking out.
[17:53.57]Get to the waypoint.
[18:01.26]Holy shit, that was pretty good.
[18:08.02]Come on!
[18:08.58]Dude, do you get cars in this game?
[18:15.54]Tell me you get a car.
[18:16.24]Do you get a car?
[18:20.86]Yes.
[18:21.30]Okay.
[18:22.34]I'm incredibly excited.
[18:25.82]Wait for vehicle delivery.
[18:27.31]Vehicle delivery.
[18:29.93]Where is it?
[18:32.67]It drops out of the sky?
[18:39.63]See if it's gonna crush me drive the iguana.
[18:43.09]Yes.
[18:44.41]Yes.
[18:45.14]Yes.
[18:45.48]Yes.
[18:45.84]Yes.
[18:46.18]Yes.
[18:46.50]Yes.
[18:46.82]Yes.
[18:47.14]Yes.
[18:47.44]Yes Drive where am I driving?
[18:54.62]That is a full letter grade.
[18:57.78]It is a full letter grade.
[18:58.82]That's what happens Okay, go back down here
[19:10.06]It went from F to a D. Um... No, it went from a C to a B. Alright, now it's... Wait, now it's a B minus.
[19:22.11]Now it's a B plus.
[19:26.37]Okay.
[19:27.39]I just had to see what would happen.
[19:30.47]You can actually do it.
[19:31.27]Okay, you can ghost ride cars.
[19:36.19]Did I get him?
[19:38.03]Oh, I didn't get him.
[19:39.03]I thought I got him both.
[19:46.64]Where's the car?
[19:53.76]Where did it go?
[19:56.80]Did it keep going?
[19:57.73]Okay, this blend.
[20:02.13]I thought this was part of the rocks.
[20:09.30]There's a handbrake?
[20:10.40]How do I do it?
[20:10.96]Okay, I think that's it.
[20:15.84]Okay, she turned into a hermit crab.
[20:18.64]Why am I still alive?
[20:38.31]Okay, open up the menu.
[20:40.31]Satellite guided bomb.
[20:43.29]Where is it?
[20:43.73]Alright.
[20:48.42]Take it out.
[20:50.84]Got it.
[20:51.30]A tank?
[20:51.54]Wait, give me that ammo.
[21:13.18]Oh wow, level destruction.
[21:14.46]Yeah, that's cool.
[21:15.32]Alright, let's go.
[21:17.24]Let's get in the tank.
[21:18.64]How many different vehicles are there?
[21:20.66]Is there a motorcycle?
[21:21.34]If there's a motorcycle, this game's automatically an A-.
[21:27.62]Steal it or nuke it.
[21:29.04]What do I mean?
[21:29.54]Yeah, get in it.
[21:31.86]Why would I destroy this?
[21:37.13]Um... Okay, but... Move, steer, shoot.
[21:45.07]Oh, God.
[21:53.50]This game is fucked.
[21:54.48]This game is mega fucked on PC.
[21:56.80]Is it?
[22:05.64]I can't- It's hard to turn.
[22:07.16]It's mega fucked on PC.
[22:09.42]What are you- Is that gonna be a problem?
[22:20.10]Switch weapons.
[22:24.62]How do I switch weapons?
[22:30.32]I'm trying to do it.
[22:31.10]Switch weapons.
[22:32.50]Oh, there we go.
[22:42.00]This just sounds like popcorn in the microwave.
[22:46.37]I gotta make it realistic.
[22:47.15]Hold on.
[22:50.79]Do I take it out yet?
[22:52.88]Do I take it out yet?
[22:56.08]No, not yet.
[22:57.57]Okay.
[22:57.95]No, that's fine.
[22:58.37]That's fine.
[22:58.69]Get it out.
[22:58.97]Get it out now.
[22:59.77]Get it out now before it explodes!
[23:01.71]Anybody else have that irrational fear?
[23:12.54]You don't have that irrational fear.
[23:14.46]You know you're supposed to count two seconds between pops.
[23:18.33]If it's longer than two seconds, then I feel like there's a risk of explosion.
[23:29.06]Get to the waypoint.
[23:31.62]Wait, hold on.
[23:32.18]Can I just like...
[23:39.94]Why would you stand up there?
[23:41.99]Okay, if you're this guy, don't you dive off now.
[23:44.85]Why would you continue to stand up on this?
[23:50.41]These are houses?
[23:51.33]Wait, but there's people shooting at me.
[24:14.95]Okay, that was pretty fucked up.
[24:19.61]Alright, let's go the right direction.
[24:22.77]Bridge is out.
[24:23.97]Oh, sweating!
[24:25.78]Bridge is out.
[24:39.09]Get inside the complex?
[24:40.19]How about we just blow it up?
[24:41.83]Just take it out from over here!
[24:45.73]Why is it healing?
[24:52.29]Don't worry, they'll come out.
[24:53.25]Don't worry, we'll smoke them out.
[25:03.20]Can you just destroy everything?
[25:13.52]Wait, why is it being rebuilt?
[25:22.40]This is just like when you're destroying a building in Warcraft and the guy puts like 10 peons on it.
[25:27.29]And you're just like, get these fucking things out of here!
[25:29.29]Oh, what's this?
[25:37.89]Wait, oh!
[25:43.89]Wait, where is it?
[25:44.53]Air support is on the way.
[26:01.48]Did I do it?
[26:19.49]What happened?
[26:22.71]Mission complete.
[26:26.42]Wait, was this supposed to be a hideout?
[26:28.68]Oh.
[26:29.08]Who the hell are you?
[26:30.28]I'm Mui.
[26:31.52]Where's the rest of your team?
[26:32.82]I'm the complete package.
[26:33.96]So you're a merc.
[26:35.28]He knows a good deal when he sees it.
[26:37.96]Let's get the hell out of here.
[26:40.69]Is somebody really mad that they don't have the premiere project file anymore?
[26:44.73]To be able to re-render these in HD like full 1080.
[26:47.28]I'm sorry, the job is not for you.
[26:48.78]The job is you.
[27:05.43]Tomorrow, General Carmona's troops will roll into the capital and I will be Venezuela's new leader.
[27:10.85]You should have just paid me the money.
[27:12.21]I love money.
[27:13.03]This means there will be many bounties on my head.
[27:15.64]I can't have your friends hunting me.
[27:18.34]It's bad for business.
[27:20.00]So is this.
[27:21.18]Now I have to kill you.
[27:24.32]Sorry, Jane.
[27:25.35]Why is it bleeped?
[27:34.82]That wasn't even a bleep.
[27:36.10]That was like a phone touch tone.
[27:38.82]Why did she do that?
[27:41.43]Oh my god.
[27:46.67]That was what the... After the beep.
[27:49.73]If you leave a message for somebody.
[27:54.26]That was ridiculous.
[27:55.21]I can't even process what just happened.
[27:57.01]That was fucking crazy.
[27:58.19]This is a crack game.
[27:58.79]Yeah.
[28:35.33]I don't know.
[28:38.97]Whatever.
[28:39.35]What am I saying?
[28:46.52]I blinked and she kicked a guy in the balls from behind.
[28:49.22]I didn't even see the cutscene.
[28:52.04]I feel like I just had a dream.
[28:53.26]What?
[29:21.43]These people have suffered poverty and injustice through administration after administration.
[29:25.88]They're not opposed to Solano.
[29:27.54]They're opposed to anyone running the country but them.
[29:39.58]Okay, so I'm trying to piece this together
[29:57.21]at the expense of the people.
[29:58.61]President Solano, meanwhile, promised to throw his own considerable resources behind his programs to turn Venezuela into, as he put it, a South American superpower.
[30:07.10]The oil belongs to you, the people, and from now on, you...
[30:19.98]Okay.
[30:21.11]I don't know why, but I thought that was that guy.
[30:23.33]Director Cameron Brown.
[30:24.49]I was like, alright, this guy, this is a solid snake.
[30:27.97]Metal Gear Snake, whatever.
[30:30.39]Wait, you can steal cars?
[30:32.44]No, you can't.
[30:32.94]No, you can't.
[30:33.42]No, you can't.
[30:33.94]You can't do that.
[30:36.32]No, there's no way.
[30:37.62]This is you can't, right?
[30:44.00]Can you get hit by cars?
[30:45.03]Kind of.
[30:50.22]It's a motorcycle!
[30:52.58]Okay, there's a motorcycle in the game.
[30:53.88]Okay, it's an A-.
[30:55.28]Give me this thing.
[30:56.12]Oh, yeah!
[31:08.11]Holy shit.
[31:13.50]Okay, I have to have fun.
[31:15.22]Alright, give me that motorcycle bike.
[31:18.96]This is too much stimulation.
[31:20.82]There's another one right here.
[31:22.52]We'll take this one.
[31:30.89]Wait, is that bike?
[31:32.15]There's two bikes here.
[31:36.21]Wait, can you punch?
[31:42.31]Why is the bike still driving by itself?
[31:57.23]Wait, I'm getting battlefielded?
[32:03.26]Wait, they have a out-of-bounds, like, battlefield.
[32:06.36]Alright, how do I... There's a first-person mode, too.
[32:11.95]This is amazing.
[32:13.11]Alright, I'm gonna do first-person driving.
[32:14.65]How am I getting shot at by... Wait, what's that, money?
[32:27.84]How is he still alive?
[32:41.82]I feel like I'm an animal.
[32:43.58]Like I'm a wild fucking animal.
[32:51.29]Just put like fucking screaming like bear noises right there.
[32:54.41]Wait, I didn't even get the money.
[33:01.87]Police Academy?
[33:04.40]What do you mean Police Academy?
[33:10.28]Wait, I think I know what you're talking about.
[33:12.04]No, not... What is it?
[33:20.55]Naked Gun.
[33:21.13]The Naked Gun movies?
[33:26.89]Well, that means destruction.
[33:28.27]But we're doing great.
[33:31.19]Wait, there's a bad guy?
[33:33.61]What's this?
[33:34.71]Ooh, $25,000.
[33:38.25]Alright, that's not a bad guy.
[33:46.90]Did I get everything?
[33:47.50]Alright, wait.
[33:52.34]What is this?
[34:02.62]Oh.
[34:04.98]Requires a helicopter pilot to steal.
[34:07.12]Are you kidding me?
[34:08.00]Wait, what?
[34:08.70]Guys are weaving around.
[34:19.18]I have to do a mission.
[34:20.59]I'm going to lose my mind.
[34:21.53]The enemy is here.
[34:28.51]All dead BZ troops.
[34:35.28]Alright, we gotta bang a left.
[34:38.26]Don't kill people.
[34:39.14]I... What are you... I'm being shot at.
[34:41.48]I do want a motorcycle, though.
[34:46.53]That's way cooler.
[34:47.13]Will this guy fly over the handlebars?
[34:49.83]No.
[34:55.33]Why would you turn into me?
[34:59.57]I'm not killing anybody!
[35:06.27]I want a bike though.
[35:08.31]I want a bike.
[35:09.23]Give me the bike.
[35:10.09]Why is this thing on ice?
[35:36.30]No, get... There we are.
[35:47.24]Come on, let's go.
[35:47.98]Alright, I want the other camera angle.
[35:50.64]Oh, shit.
[35:52.38]Wait, turn left?
[35:53.84]Alright, turn left.
[36:11.70]I almost got in.
[36:27.74]I almost got in.
[36:29.06]I just had to drive as fast as I could.
[36:34.65]Wait, how do I open this gate?
[36:38.32]Open the gate!
[36:40.34]What did I just get a little jump for?
[36:42.00]That was cool.
[36:43.59]Alright, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[36:46.17]Get a real car.
[36:48.91]Oh shit, there's a temporal disturbance!
[36:56.23]I'm pulling you out!
[36:57.25]I'm pulling you out, Jen!
[36:59.05]No, don't do it yet, I'm not ready!
[37:01.07]No, you've been in there for too long!
[37:07.86]What do I do?
[37:12.31]Why can't I get in?
[37:19.31]I don't have access to an airstrike.
[37:23.37]I don't have an airstrike.
[37:33.68]I need a car?
[37:38.14]What?
[37:42.66]Use a grenade.
[37:43.32]Use a van.
[37:43.90]I don't have any grenades.
[37:44.68]I don't have any.
[37:46.20]Alright, I'm gonna take that car.
[37:52.19]There's a car right here.
[37:58.35]Use your head.

[38:38.72]But it's like a little scavenger hunt This must be a maze I found it Wait, I had to kill that guy Did I get him like I had it on the last?
[38:57.95]Is he dead?
[39:01.25]I got him.
[39:02.73]Alright.
[39:04.51]Imagine being that guy.
[39:06.01]Yes, I'm going to hide in the elaborate maze that she will never find me.
[39:11.65]Boss, she's driving through the hedges.
[39:14.39]Ooh.
[39:14.55]Come on, his trips are a joke.
[39:27.66]Somebody, when they write about this in the history books, make sure you said it took her at least two minutes to find me.
[39:37.74]Why did I just, like, hacky sack that into the air?
[39:47.33]Take ammo.
[39:48.37]Take ammo.
[39:49.07]Get out of here.

[42:33.08]Okay, that was pretty good, though.
[42:36.29]Can I just drive through the wall?
[42:37.13]This is the most efficient way to mow the lawn.

[43:00.40]Alright, where is he?
[43:01.02]Right here?

[45:26.80]Is this two people or is that one person?
[45:32.28]Why are they dead?
[45:35.08]Okay, go to the front of the entrance.
[45:59.47]They can't swim.
[46:01.37]It's always so funny in games where you can't swim, where water instantly kills you.
[46:10.26]It doesn't cause any blood.
[46:11.98]It's like a poison.
[46:12.82]It's an instant poison.
[46:18.12]It's like getting electrocuted.
[46:19.14]Water is electricity.
[46:21.72]Oh my goodness!
[46:23.70]You dick.
[46:24.30]I needed that.
[46:24.86]I want your thing.

[46:44.53]Wait.
[46:46.75]Alright, that's gonna take way too long.
[46:50.10]Never mind.
[46:54.37]Is there another car I can take?
[46:56.53]There we go.
[46:59.61]Yeah, I've got my tried and true.
[47:01.43]My trusty.
[47:04.49]Important.
[47:05.01]This game has a manual save.
[47:06.33]If you die, you go to the beginning.
[47:08.17]What?
[47:09.99]Oh my god.
[47:15.80]Thank you for saying that.
[47:24.28]Why did you tell him that?
[47:25.64]Um, I'm so glad you did.
[47:36.49]Don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot, don't shoot!
[47:45.49]No!
[47:46.67]The same fate!
[47:48.07]The same fate as the last one!
[47:57.08]Alright, I made it.
[48:00.28]Now what?
[48:05.64]Inside the villa.
[48:06.52]Alright, I got one shot.
[48:09.92]Wait, can I destroy everything?
[48:11.25]Alright, I'm going to destroy the statue of Michelangelo.
[48:23.07]What's going on?
[48:29.36]We good?
[48:31.64]Okay.
[48:33.18]Get close to the tank turret?
[48:34.86]Hijack the tank.
[48:35.76]Oh, no.
[48:36.66]Okay.
[48:36.81]Whoa!
[48:36.99]Hijack.
[49:01.46]Well, that was weird.
[49:02.14]I just kind of fell through the ground.
[49:05.74]Behind that tank!
[49:06.89]Uh, go to the courtyard.
[49:11.57]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[49:16.56]I want a motorcycle in here so bad.
[49:18.22]Behind that thing!
[49:23.34]Behind that building!
[49:36.95]Alright, hijack the tank.
[49:42.41]Alright, I got $115,000.
[49:43.41]Do you buy new weapons and shit in this game?
[49:49.26]This is... I'm gonna like this.
[49:50.80]This is gonna be a lot of fun.
[49:55.08]Okay, I'm ready.
[49:58.40]Got it.
[50:08.00]Grenade!
[50:08.52]Come back over here, come here!
[50:14.17]What is this sound?
[50:44.97]Okay, I just wanted to see what would happen.
[50:48.87]I'll get it instantly.
[50:49.75]Ready?
[50:50.25]Count to one.
[50:51.71]One!
[50:52.35]Don't I want to hijack this?
[50:59.28]I don't think that's what would happen.
[51:00.32]Destroy the entourage.
[51:12.32]Was the plane part of it?
[51:29.17]Die!
[51:30.45]Die!
[51:31.51]He's the last guy.
[51:32.15]Right there?
[51:33.27]Alright, so do I leave?
[51:34.89]Alright, so we go up the stairs.
[51:43.78]Destroy the statue.
[51:46.02]Don't have time.
[51:46.70]No, no, no, no.
[51:49.79]The statue stays.
[51:56.65]That was Harry Potter music?
[51:57.91]Kind of, yeah.
[52:01.25]I know.
[52:01.75]I'm looking for contracts right now.
[52:08.94]Alright, we gotta find Blanco.
[52:35.85]Is that a casino?
[52:36.21]Uh oh.
[52:36.33]Oh.
[52:36.39]In placed weapons challenge one.
[53:06.54]Let's do it.
[53:09.79]Ooh!
[53:10.79]Okay.
[53:14.95]Yeah, the magic word.
[53:21.19]Alright, here's a simple wager between you and me.
[53:23.36]I've set up an emplaced weapons challenge on the PMC grounds.
[53:27.06]Use the weapons to blow up targets before the timer runs out and you win.
[53:30.42]Destroying the cars during the challenge will pause the timer.
[53:34.48]Wager 1,000.
[53:51.89]Let's go!
[54:22.14]Where's the last button?
[54:22.94]Where's the last statue?
[54:23.58]Where is it?
[54:23.88]Alright, shoot the cars.
[54:35.55]Move to the recoil-less rifles and shoot cars.
[54:40.55]What?
[54:42.59]All I gotta do it in the air?
[54:52.07]Come on, come on!
[54:57.44]Come on!
[54:59.32]God damn it!
[55:07.71]Damn it!
[55:18.17]What's the travel time on this thing?
[55:30.02]Shit!
[55:32.10]Shit!
[55:36.70]Oh!
[55:36.90]Now what?
[55:50.61]He sucks.
[55:51.67]He does not suck.
[55:53.89]Move to the grenade launchers.
[55:55.05]I've got 2 minutes and 48 seconds.
[55:56.58]Alright, move to...
[56:24.24]Where is it?
[56:24.80]What do I have to destroy?
[56:26.08]There's nothing else to blow up.
[56:42.15]What?
[56:43.41]It's $100,000 that it's made.
[56:45.91]It's the easiest $100,000 I've ever made in my life.
[56:49.15]Like, that's the easiest $100,000 ever.
[56:51.51]I had a full three minutes.
[56:54.03]I have to... That's like... Come on.
[57:02.76]Grenade launcher challenge level one.
[57:07.96]Ah.
[57:14.44]Grenade launcher course for you to be.
[57:15.72]Use the launcher to blow up the targets.
[57:16.96]You can only fire from behind the sandbag.
[57:18.78]Let's go.
[57:25.42]He's addicted.
[57:26.05]Alright, let's go.
[57:27.91]Reload!
[57:28.31]Reload!
[57:29.33]Reload!
[57:30.31]Reload!
[57:31.85]Reload!
[58:03.88]What?
[58:09.21]Last one, right?
[58:09.83]Alright, two minutes.
[58:11.37]I got plenty of time.
[58:21.31]Oh, shit.
[58:21.83]I have one shot left.
[58:35.97]What?
[58:37.95]What do I have to do?
[58:39.01]Destroy statues?
[58:40.07]What statues?
[58:47.04]Where are they?
[58:47.64]I don't understand.
[58:48.43]It's behind them?
[59:10.38]It's splash damage.
[59:12.22]Okay, splash damage.
[59:13.20]Oh shit, there's another one.
[59:21.96]I did it.
[59:23.28]That's 100 fucking thousand more dollars.
[59:36.41]Save the game, quick.
[59:37.77]Okay, yes.
[59:38.55]Not even close.
[59:41.97]Pistol level one.
[59:42.94]Alright, hold on.
[59:43.62]Let me save it.
[59:45.02]So I get like a million dollars?
[59:56.53]Another one.
[59:58.01]Stop gambling, Gary.
[59:59.05]Alright, I'll do pistol challenge and that's it.
[60:09.98]Uh, pistol course.
[60:11.04]Shoot down all the Solano portraits with your pistol.
[60:14.44]Remember, you can only fire from behind the sandbag.
[60:16.50]Let's go.
[60:19.46]Just retire.
[60:21.13]I haven't even done one mission yet.
[60:22.35]Alright, how do I beat this?
[60:27.13]What is it?
[60:27.47]Do I have to swim underneath it?
[60:28.57]Okay.
[60:29.29]Um, how do I get up there?
[60:30.97]Wait, what's going on?
[60:48.96]Wait, am I bugged out of the map?
[60:54.68]This is not fair.
[60:57.02]This is a huge disadvantage.
[60:58.42]Do I have to swim to the shore?
[60:59.67]I'm only going to have one... Alright, right here.
[61:09.63]I've got to be quick.
[61:13.88]I'm swimming further down.
[61:21.77]I can't shoot from here.
[61:30.15]Medivac.
[61:41.80]Wait, I lost 110,000.
[61:56.72]That's bullshit.
[61:57.66]That's absolute horseshit.
[61:58.62]I'm not gonna stand for that one.
[62:08.81]I'm not standing for that one.
[62:17.87]Why am I going so fast?
[62:19.19]Where's my money?
[62:21.85]How much money do I have?
[62:22.87]There we go.
[62:23.44]Alright.
[62:24.00]Wait, this is like a thing.
[62:24.90]Wait, can I buy clothes?
[62:30.99]No outfits found.
[62:31.91]How do I buy them?
[62:32.47]Alright, is the game running at 60 FPS and the game is not running times 2 speed?
[62:38.99]Am I going crazy or what happened here?
[62:40.77]No, I don't care.
[62:43.36]Let's go.
[62:43.94]I'm doing the mission now.
[62:44.74]I got 315,000.
[62:45.00]Universal Petroleum.
[63:00.57]I've done some research on that American oil company that Blanco is involved with.
[63:04.43]They're called Universal Petroleum.
[63:06.57]Before Solano took over, they had exclusive rights to drill for oil and only gave the Venezuelan government ridiculously small cuts.
[63:13.71]Even faster.
[63:14.49]Good business for the oil company.
[63:17.45]Yeah, not so good for the Venezuelan.
[63:19.13]Oh, by the way, just to make sure everyone knows, August 23rd is the last day you can submit for the DLC movie night.
[63:24.79]Sign the deal with Optical Solutions for private military support.
[63:28.79]And then that stream is going to be on the 29th.
[63:31.11]Solving some problems for UP senior executive here, Dr. Lorraine Rubin, should show them how much more useful we can be.
[63:38.80]So far, there are about 400 videos.
[63:42.80]So it's going to be wild.
[63:44.74]It's 400 of them.
[63:47.96]We still have to go through the first wave of vetting them.
[63:53.24]But I have to imagine it's not going to be too far from like 350.
[63:58.81]360 or something.
[63:59.65]I don't know.
[64:02.01]4 OMEGALUL, OMEGALUL. Yeah, alright.
[64:05.19]Uh, steal guns.
[64:07.63]Return the shipment to the up HQ.
[64:11.61]$500 a gun.
[64:12.31]That's nothing.
[64:13.19]I can make $100,000 in 5 seconds.
[64:14.15]Well, this is not looking good.
[64:32.94]Am I just going through the sewers?
[64:34.32]Am I going to open up underneath this guy's toilet?
[64:41.39]Well, I'm having a little bit more trouble, lady.
[65:00.83]Um, no.
[65:01.92]I'm trying to get back up to the surface.
[65:10.04]Stop talking to me for a second.
[65:18.12]Okay.
[65:18.36]Beacon.
[65:19.28]Place.
[65:19.52]Thank you.
[65:34.59]There's gotta be a way I can get up here, right?
[65:38.57]I'm gonna go this way.
[65:39.57]Get away from the house.
[65:43.55]I feel like I can probably swim up that.
[65:51.32]Am I making any progress?
[65:52.22]I think so.
[65:55.38]Swim to the bottom of the world.
[65:56.88]I don't think this is a dive.
[65:57.80]You have to find a pool and swim up.
[66:05.39]I don't want to do that.
[66:07.37]Oh, no.
[66:07.95]Do I have to go find a... Oh, that's not good.
[66:11.41]Oh, don't give me those things to do because I'm going to do them.
[66:16.79]I actually have to find a pool in the town and swim up the pool.
[66:29.44]Is there a body of water over here?
[66:35.01]There's a pool in the backyard.
[66:37.19]There's one at the villa.
[66:38.27]Fuck.
[66:41.94]It's too late.
[66:45.20]What?
[66:45.36]Okay, there's no more water right here.
[66:47.02]So it's gonna force me up onto the land, isn't it?
[66:49.12]That's false.
[66:58.59]No, Omeglel, no.
[66:59.75]It's not gonna stop.
[67:01.19]There's no more water to swim in.
[67:02.23]Wouldn't it just push me up through the Earth?
[67:15.57]No, it'll push you down.
[67:17.71]Oh my god.
[67:18.49]Where's the fucking pool?
[67:22.83]Where is it?
[67:27.08]Lock your frames?
[67:29.08]I mean, if the frames are locked at 60, should I lock it to 30?
[67:31.16]Lock it to 30.
[67:31.50]Oh, but that's... That's ugly.
[67:47.57]Let me just see if I can go up here.
[67:49.79]Is this the pool right here?
[67:58.68]This looks like water going straight up.
[68:20.60]I just want to climb up this.
[68:23.08]Okay, I'm almost there.
[68:24.30]Alright, now go up.
[68:30.41]No?
[68:31.81]Just pull me out.
[68:38.24]Don't forget to stock up on fuel and support.
[68:40.80]Retry?
[68:41.28]Yes.
[68:41.64]Alright, come on.
[68:44.64]Drop me.
[68:45.02]Don't drop me in the water again.
[68:46.12]There we go.
[68:47.74]Alright, we're up.
[68:48.22]We're up.
[68:48.46]We're up.
[68:48.68]We're up.
[68:48.88]We're up.
[68:49.08]We're good.
[68:49.52]We're up.
[68:49.76]Look, I made $300,000.
[68:50.16]It's okay if I lose $10,000.
[68:50.80]Steal a truck.
[68:52.10]Yep.
[68:52.32]Open that PDA.
[68:52.68]Set a route.
[68:53.02]Did you guys say route or did you guys say route?
[68:55.68]What did you guys say?
[68:56.48]I said route.
[68:57.02]Take a look in your PDA.
[69:17.79]Thank you.
[69:19.71]So what are these two missile things?
[69:27.90]Remember, go back in the water.
[69:28.66]You missed a secret.
[69:30.22]I don't care.
[69:30.60]Alright, I need a helicopter pilot to get this stuff?
[69:34.60]Fine.
[69:34.88]Do you call a router a router?
[69:38.70]No.
[69:40.36]But if you have a route, you have a root.
[69:45.19]Either one works.
[69:45.89]They're both phonetically correct in English.
[70:03.25]No, they're both right.
[70:06.33]They're both correct.
[70:10.69]Stop!
[70:12.49]Are there police in this game?
[70:16.83]I don't think there is.
[70:24.60]There's no star system, right?
[70:33.21]Follow that person.
[70:38.47]No, I want to do the mission.
[70:45.93]Whatever.
[70:46.79]I want the bike, but I can't get the bike.
[70:49.33]You know what I mean?
[70:52.89]You're a maniac.
[70:53.81]I'm so glad there are bikes.
[70:54.92]I can't wait to go for a sick jump.
[70:56.88]They spawned in.
[70:57.50]That's not my fault.
[71:11.84]Like a glove.
[71:18.31]I just bumped him.
[71:19.15]He's alright.
[71:22.29]Give me that.
[71:22.73]I want a motorcycle.
[71:23.73]There's so much fun.
[71:24.75]I love driving around in like GTA type games with motorcycles.
[71:29.38]I'm gonna get it.
[71:29.98]How are you still on it?
[71:46.20]Daft Punk.
[71:47.60]I love it.
[71:49.60]You can just go up on one wheel.
[72:01.88]Ow.
[72:03.41]Right up here.
[72:05.17]And then... Do I have to... Oh, steal the truck.
[72:07.39]Right, okay.
[72:07.83]Steal the truck and take it to the UP HQ.
[72:14.33]Give me the truck!
[72:22.73]Not the right truck.
[72:26.42]Can you get in the canoe?
[72:34.71]Cargo value.
[72:35.77]Alright.
[72:37.05]Alright.
[72:37.31]I need to go up here.
[72:48.97]Harry Potter.
[72:51.07]Stop!
[72:52.58]Yeah, don't bang up the truck.
[73:05.77]MCU music?
[73:07.13]What the fuck was that?
[73:19.55]Why did he do that?
[73:20.57]The guy was trying to flip me.
[73:25.41]I'm not gonna have anything left.
[73:34.10]1.5 thousand?
[73:35.32]Are you shitting me?
[73:46.82]All the guns!
[73:59.28]Okay, need at least $500 in cargo.
[74:01.36]Let's go.
[74:02.58]I get it.
[74:02.90]I get it.
[74:03.14]I get it.
[74:03.38]I get it.
[74:03.64]I get it.
[74:03.88]I get it.
[74:04.24]This is fun.
[74:05.40]This is fun.
[74:05.82]He's gonna keep the shit in the back.
[74:10.50]Oh, this is a cool car.
[74:11.34]That hurt me?
[74:11.82]This is a fucking Cadillac.
[74:12.66]Alright, not going to mess it up some.
[74:14.18]I'm going to try to get as many as I can.
[74:44.22]That guy got pulled off with like movie wire.
[74:48.33]That was a matrix scene.
[74:49.57]What happened?
[74:50.27]Oh shit, that guy.
[75:00.85]I know!
[75:01.91]Look, I did it already.
[75:03.85]I'm already a full step ahead of you.
[75:10.09]Damn it, I was trying to hit the guy in the head.
[75:16.95]I will get like a headshot with a bike, I promise, at least once.
[75:19.42]Alright, cargo!
[75:21.40]Alright, let's be easy.
[75:31.40]I'm gonna try to get as much as I can here.
[75:38.98]Why would they just be loose in the back?
[75:41.08]You can't wrap these up like saran wrap or something?
[75:47.46]Where's the bungees to hold these things down?
[75:49.40]Put a tarp on it.
[75:54.72]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[75:55.32]Like, tie a tarp down behind here.
[75:58.42]All this loose shit.
[75:59.78]You never should carry anything like this.
[76:04.83]You always drive by that guy on the highway that's got, like, a fucking mattress with one bungee on there.
[76:10.51]And he's going, like, 40 miles, like, 30 miles per hour on the highway.
[76:14.05]It's like, dude, you can't take a back road?
[76:15.97]Like, what the fuck are you doing?
[76:23.12]How much is in there?
[76:24.72]There's still $500.
[76:25.30]Push it.
[76:25.66]I can't move.
[76:26.60]I'm marking the location of the guy who hijacked Universal Petroleum's
[76:45.90]God damn it.
[76:58.51]It's this guy.
[76:59.33]This is a deliberate sabotage.
[77:01.90]Guy drives across the whole thing and he just murders you.
[77:05.68]Just drives into you from the side.
[77:16.91]How does it feel?
[77:18.59]What, to get sabotaged?
[77:21.28]I feel like that happens quite frequently.
[77:22.64]I want to go the other direction.
[77:35.99]Okay, here we go.
[77:47.64]Go, go, go!
[77:48.36]Okay, do not let the guy in the Mack truck smash into the side of the car.
[78:22.43]I gotta be the guy on the highway going 30.
[78:23.97]Out of the way.
[78:35.08]Alright, when does it happen?
[78:37.84]He comes right from the left side.
[78:41.82]Truck joke incoming.
[78:43.40]No.
[78:44.14]Truck joke not incoming.
[78:46.56]This is where truck joke... I can't even say it.
[78:50.16]Here it comes.
[78:50.56]Right here.
[78:50.92]He drives over here.
[78:52.95]What was that?
[78:53.59]Did I go over a bump?
[78:57.31]There it is.
[78:57.81]He's waiting.
[78:58.11]He's waiting.
[78:58.37]He's waiting.
[78:58.67]This is like an online player.
[78:59.91]Fuck you, buddy.
[79:01.13]Not gonna happen.
[79:02.35]Yup.
[79:04.27]See you later.
[79:09.26]Watch out for grenades.
[79:11.13]Now, I've gotta... Hold on.
[79:13.19]I gotta take an alternate route.
[79:14.03]I don't wanna go straight up the front.
[79:15.05]Alright, we're gonna go this way.
[79:16.67]We're gonna turn.
[79:19.49]Good.
[79:20.68]Okay, now we're gonna bang left.
[79:27.58]We're avoiding that huge barricade.
[79:35.33]Is that water?
[79:47.16]Okay.
[79:49.72]Alright, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, eh, okay, we're good.
[80:00.71]I did it.
[80:00.99]I got nine thousand dollars.
[80:09.27]One of the guns spawned outside the truck.
[80:12.32]That's unfortunate.
[80:17.82]Sneak through here.
[80:19.72]It's okay.
[80:20.18]It's alright.
[80:20.68]How do I have 31 health?
[80:21.61]Okay, here it is.
[80:23.01]$9,000.
[80:24.01]Exit the vehicle.
[80:25.21]Thank you.
[80:26.11]Return guns to... Okay.
[80:47.22]Contract fee.
[80:48.02]Bonus.
[80:48.42]$9,000.
[80:48.44]$9,000.
[80:48.62]Okay.
[80:48.78]Why are they guys shooting at me?
[80:55.52]Didn't I just do a mission for them?
[80:59.40]Didn't I just do this with these guys?
[81:02.68]Why are they doing this?
[81:20.34]I'm a dipshit.
[81:21.02]They were just lighting me up.
[81:24.42]Wait.
[81:24.78]I shot at the truck.
[81:25.86]Yeah, in the cutscene.
[81:26.56]That doesn't count.
[81:27.16]Who's asking?
[81:27.54]My name's Mui.
[81:28.81]Your boss wants to speak to me.
[81:30.33]Oh, right.
[81:31.05]You're the Mercilano shot in the ass.
[81:34.75]Hey, thanks for the guns.
[81:50.30]Tim Times gave $50.
[81:51.92]Thank you, Tim Times.
[81:53.94]That's a huge amount of money.
[81:54.84]Say thanks for all the laughs.
[81:55.96]Thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude.
[81:56.74]That's fucking crazy.
[81:58.34]I'm loving every laugh.
[81:58.94]Laughing about it.
[82:19.43]Okay, faction up.
[82:20.69]The up mercs want a favor before opening the gate.
[82:23.05]Retrieve their one-of-a-kind vehicle, the Devastator.
[82:25.33]25,000, let's do it.
[82:32.98]Am I gonna have aggro on these guys for the rest of the game?
[82:36.29]How many hoops do I have to jump through for these idiots?
[82:40.01]Just keep your eyes on the prize.
[82:41.96]Dr. Reuben knows about Blanco.
[82:43.88]This will get you a meeting with her.
[82:45.18]Great.
[82:46.54]Love meetings.
[82:48.16]Shit.
[82:48.74]It's in the middle of a hotspot where VZ and UP are duking it out.
[82:55.94]Okay, well it's just the guys outside, right?
[82:57.75]It's just the guys outside.
[83:04.85]We're fine.
[83:06.94]They're not firing.

[114:00.44]You go look at it.
[114:02.74]My game's about to actually freeze.
[114:06.82]I asked the professor a question.
[114:08.48]Well, I didn't.
[114:10.06]You're doing an illegal move in college.
[114:14.93]Oh no, I think it's broken.
[114:28.15]Are we in?

[114:43.61]You should be doing your homework and not watching this shitty stream.
[114:46.61]True.
[114:51.29]Don't even say that out loud.
[114:53.59]Alright, what about, uh, what about winching?
[115:05.13]What about a star system?
[115:07.90]Well, it's a good question.
[115:09.74]Wait, get the toolbox above the specified height and you'll win the wager.
[115:23.89]Am I going to be too short for this?
[115:28.33]Islet, the trans... Um, okay.
[115:32.11]What the hell was that?
[115:36.31]You can fly it?
[115:38.31]Deploy and retract the winch.
[115:41.93]You can fly helicopters.
[115:43.47]Okay, how do you fly this?
[115:49.83]How do I deploy it?
[115:52.86]Up?
[115:53.16]Down?
[115:53.42]Okay, it's left.

[117:53.16]Drop it.
[117:53.48]Alright, go.

[118:02.46]Okay, what?
[118:25.76]Alright, I got it.

[118:35.35]What's the goal?
[118:35.86]Too much?
[118:53.54]The target is five.
[118:55.04]Yeah, but I can't go over the target?
[118:56.40]Okay, two, five.

[122:00.70]I can't even shoot these ones.
[122:03.92]This is so fucked up.
[122:04.80]What the hell?
[122:06.02]I didn't even save the game before this either.
[122:17.62]I'm loaded inside of the wall.
[122:19.26]I get it.
[122:19.82]Okay.
[122:24.25]Maybe I could have jumped up here and...

[123:07.97]Whose emote is that?
[123:08.77]It was a laughing face.
[123:10.33]Yes, that one.

[123:40.66]I want to buy something.
[123:42.38]I have a lot of money.
[123:43.38]A greedy streamer refuses to advertise other streamers' emotes.
[124:05.14]Okay, what is going on here?
[124:06.94]Destroy targets?
[124:10.32]This is Eva's Garage and then Southeastern Amazon Outpost.
[124:14.50]Alright, we're going to go to Eva's Garage.
[124:19.33]This is very far away.
[124:20.39]Okay, where are the clothes?

[125:05.33]Okay, there we go.
[125:06.29]Alright, I want to go to Ava's garage.
[125:14.67]Why can't you go there?
[125:26.99]Wait, it has to be another helipad that I've already unlocked.
[125:58.50]He gets the picture.
[125:59.22]Kill him and take it.
[126:00.10]I don't think I can.
[126:00.83]Oh, that's where the fuel tanks and money too, right?
[126:09.25]What are you saying?
[126:31.65]Alright, here we go.

[128:03.35]What happened?
[128:03.94]Why do they hate me?
[128:11.20]Oh, okay.
[128:11.94]Alright.
[128:12.26]Wait, wait, wait.

[129:03.69]Holy shit, he's just going nuts.
[129:05.71]He's just... He's not stopping.
[129:08.29]What am I doing?
[129:11.79]Um... What am I doing?
[129:14.67]You're right.
[129:17.65]What is she doing here?
[129:18.49]Just don't hurt me.
[129:21.93]Take what you want.
[129:26.86]Police!

[129:50.68]Why would you do that?
[130:02.34]What's with these planes flying around?
[130:03.74]There's red planes that keep showing up on the mini-map.
[130:08.48]Why?
[130:14.13]Can't go up that.
[130:15.77]How's it... Ow.
[130:16.49]Okay, I was gonna say, that makes no sense.
[130:19.05]Trying to shave some time off.
[130:23.51]Wait, do people know who I am?
[130:25.37]I guess they kinda do, huh?
[130:26.81]I'm kinda going too fast to be identified, aren't I?
[131:02.94]Ooh, I made it!
[131:03.50]I actually went through it.
[131:05.34]Okay, so far so good.
[131:39.26]What did I get $25 for?
[131:49.70]The guy in the driver's side.
[131:51.76]Okay.
[131:54.70]Let's go.
[132:08.36]Yeah, this is a shitty gun.
[132:09.40]I want a new gun.
[132:15.31]I don't want just like an AK.
[132:16.47]I want something else.
[132:19.09]Wait.
[132:23.33]I can take that.
[132:28.11]Right?
[132:28.35]Can I or am I too far away?
[132:29.94]Can he actually get this?
[132:36.47]Steel tank buster.
[132:38.52]Uh, yeah.
[132:39.06]Hello?
[132:53.63]Wait, somebody's... Oh, somebody's shooting.
[133:04.83]Get on it.
[133:08.13]Wait, you mean like stand on that?
[133:11.12]Oh shit, can I do that?
[133:12.12]I'm gonna try that next time.
[133:17.18]I'm just gonna crouch on it and see what happens.
[133:19.78]Let me go to the mission first.
[133:20.94]Am I gonna play Ratatouille for the Xbox 360?
[133:26.10]No.
[133:27.18]I don't think so, I'm sorry.
[133:30.40]Oh, pardon me.
[133:33.22]Why?
[133:33.58]Play Jump King?
[133:34.48]I'm not going to play Jump King.
[133:36.00]I promised.
[133:36.62]When did I promise that I was going to play Ratatouille?
[133:41.23]Did I?
[133:41.47]I don't know why I would ever say that.
[133:43.95]Money.
[133:44.25]Money.
[134:07.10]Does this work?
[134:07.76]Am I doing anything?
[134:08.84]I don't know.
[134:10.36]Was that a grenade or was that him coming to get this?
[134:12.96]Okay.
[134:13.28]This is the best game.
[134:20.34]Wait, that's the best game ever made.
[134:21.74]Wait!
[134:21.94]Fuck.
[134:24.80]I forgot.
[134:26.02]There's another one right here.
[134:26.74]Don't worry.
[134:29.38]Ewan, stop.
[134:30.02]Stop.
[134:30.32]Ewan, come back.
[134:32.22]He's busy.
[134:32.72]I know.
[134:37.32]Okay.
[134:41.33]Come on, hurry up.
[134:43.89]Get rid of it so I can do this.
[134:45.59]Save the game?
[134:46.09]Yeah, that's a good call.
[134:50.75]You promised you'd play it in 2012.
[134:51.67]What?
[134:51.85]Do it!
[135:11.26]Did I get the money?
[135:15.58]The guy drove over it.
[135:30.85]Come on, give me a break.
[135:32.13]Remember when you said you were going to read Diary of a Wimpy Kid to us?
[135:38.21]You had a dream about that.
[135:39.51]That's not what happened.
[135:49.45]Alright, here we go.
[135:50.63]Mission time.
[135:53.33]Read it?
[135:55.35]I'm not gonna read Diary of a Wimpy Kid.
[136:02.63]You Ava Navarro?
[136:03.94]I know who you are.
[136:04.96]You're the mercenary.
[136:06.38]The one Solano shot in the ass.
[136:07.92]Solano's goons should come here.
[136:09.94]What do you mean you figured I'd come here?
[136:11.70]You're alone.
[136:11.98]You need help.
[136:13.18]You go through vehicles quick.
[136:14.72]Need them repaired.
[136:15.60]So this is the... You hate Carmona.
[136:20.61]You hate Solano.
[136:21.33]You probably need a helicopter pilot.
[136:22.49]I've got a helicopter pilot.
[136:24.49]What do you have against Carmona?
[136:25.97]If you're planning on using airstrikes.
[136:27.73]I am.
[136:28.86]Alright, so you've got a thing against Carmona.
[136:31.62]It's funny each time.
[136:32.40]It's funny every time.
[136:57.38]Okay, test drive the Acharo de Muerte for Eva.
[136:59.18]Told you the PC version is fucked.
[137:00.12]Yeah, that's why I got the PlayStation 3 version and I couldn't capture it.
[137:02.90]I don't know why, for no reason.
[137:04.11]Okay, test drive.
[137:27.98]Is it right here?
[137:29.98]Oh this is a comedy car, I can't wait.
[137:32.40]Is it a tuber car?
[137:33.28]Maybe somebody needs to jump.
[137:34.70]Is it a jump?
[137:36.90]It better be.
[137:57.32]You know what kind of car?
[137:58.20]Okay, I had one of these.
[137:59.64]I had a car like this.
[138:01.40]Where I could flip it over and it would still drive.
[138:03.79]I'd be driving around and the thing would just flip the fuck over and I could still drive it upside down and right side up.
[138:12.37]It was awesome.
[138:14.77]I would drive this shit over fucking like cliffs and I would drive it all over the place.
[138:20.94]I'd go on the grass and stuff.
[138:22.50]It was awesome.
[138:23.64]It was so much fun.
[138:27.70]No, not a regular car.
[138:29.14]A, uh, like an RC car.
[138:31.44]Yeah.
[138:31.98]What was that thing called?
[138:33.46]It was called like the Reverso or something.
[138:35.80]Prior to the strip mine.
[138:36.82]It was fast too.
[138:37.34]I can't believe this is an actual jump.
[138:57.96]Rebound that's the one yep, I think was awesome Works Rough terrain, let's see
[139:31.79]Crackdown?
[139:35.49]Too bad that Crackdown 3 was terrible, right?
[139:50.18]We're good.
[139:54.58]Crackdown 3 was destined to be awful.
[139:58.14]I don't even remember Crackdown 2.
[140:02.25]I remember Crackdown 1.
[140:07.83]I never played it.
[140:11.51]2 was the same mission 12 times.
[140:13.87]That's unfortunate.
[140:21.18]Crackdown 2 was just Crackdown 1 with zombies.
[140:24.68]They went with that trope, huh?
[140:29.56]Oh, I have to hit this.
[140:30.76]I'm not just going to drive into... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[140:36.88]What is it specifically about this game that is fun?
[140:40.13]Um... The whole thing?
[140:43.07]I think it's really fun.
[140:44.95]Oh, I have 25 seconds.
[140:49.33]Okay.
[140:59.53]I'm almost there.
[141:00.03]I'm almost there.
[141:00.39]Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on. Come on.
[141:04.23]No!
[141:09.23]Here's proof of you saying I was gonna play Ratatouille. Hahaha.
[141:21.23]Alright, can I- in my defense: who cares?
[141:36.99]I do.
[141:37.83]But in my defense, it's Ratatouille the game.
[141:42.49]Who does it really matter if I play it or not?
[141:44.88]I mean, I'm going to on September 28th or something.
[141:51.24]I don't know.
[141:59.20]He's doing the same joke again.
[142:02.62]You figured me out.
[142:04.46]You figured out everything I do.
[142:15.18]Wanna jump?
[142:19.50]This is a long mission.
[142:23.45]Yes, your hydraulics work.
[142:24.75]Can I go back to driving a motorcycle?
[142:36.49]I quit after this mission.
[142:39.39]That's not gonna be me.
[142:43.53]I want to fly the helicopter.
[142:44.83]I want to fly the helicopter.
[142:50.14]No, no, no, no, no, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please, please.
[142:57.63]No, why?
[142:58.71]I don't want to do this again.
[142:59.57]I don't want to do this again.
[143:00.73]Oh, my fucking God.
[143:16.40]I quit after this mission.
[143:17.36]No, no, it's not gonna happen to me.
[143:19.46]No, it's not.
[143:20.36]Okay, I'm just go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[143:25.44]Next?
[143:34.73]No, wait, what?
[143:35.45]Next?
[143:35.75]What?
[143:37.23]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, just, just hold on.
[143:51.33]No, I'm staying here.
[143:52.13]I'm not- This game is fucking fun.
[143:54.63]Just, this mission's stupid.
[143:56.03]Okay?
[143:56.31]Don't worry.
[143:56.67]We're gonna get out of this stupid mission and we're gonna go back to fucking throwing grenades at people.
[144:02.19]Car's gonna drive by and I'm gonna get- It's gonna hit me and I'm gonna go- I actually do want to see what else is in the game.
[144:16.27]I'm having a lot of fun in this one.
[144:18.93]Alright, I don't- Don't fuck- I have plenty of time.
[144:26.87]This little challenge.
[144:27.67]If I can do it, I would love to do it.
[144:29.21]I want to spend money too.
[144:30.03]I haven't even spent a dollar.
[144:32.81]It's definitely like a jetpack or something.
[144:39.49]Don't fucking come at me.
[144:45.02]The funniest part about the Ratatouille game stream.
[144:48.44]Yeah.
[144:49.48]Oh, let's see.
[144:51.60]I bet you like 3,000 of you don't even show up.
[145:05.00]Like one of the lowest viewed streams in history.
[145:09.02]Play Ratatouille, dude.
[145:10.36]Do it.
[145:12.08]Wait, he's actually playing Ratatouille?
[145:13.78]No.
[145:15.60]I got something else going on today.
[145:17.64]What's going on?
[145:19.63]How do I get up there?
[145:34.06]What the fuck?
[145:38.30]Wait.
[145:39.22]This is... And then... Wait, I have to go back all the way around.
[145:46.79]I'm not gonna do this.
[145:47.65]It's gonna fail.
[145:48.17]I have nine seconds to go around the entire course.
[145:56.17]Oh my god.
[146:00.10]Why did I fall off the fridge?
[146:02.28]No!
[146:04.13]No, I'm gonna beat it.
[146:05.47]I don't care.
[146:06.43]No, no, no, no, no.
[146:08.17]I'm playing this.
[146:09.25]No, it's not gonna happen.
[146:10.45]I have to beat this.
[146:11.53]There is no next game.
[146:14.29]It is only this game.
[146:33.00]I'm not going to quit.
[146:33.90]I'm not going to quit.
[146:35.08]I want you to remember who said that.
[146:38.96]All of you that think I'm going to quit, it's not going to happen.
[146:40.88]I'm going to play this through until I beat this.
[146:44.09]Maybe that's the whole game, but enough until I fly the helicopter into, like, a car.
[146:49.81]You know, that's going to be funny when I do that one.
[146:57.74]I don't want to do this again.
[146:59.58]I don't want to do this again.
[147:00.80]I want to play the game.
[147:05.54]Don't fuck it up.
[147:06.96]Just do it normally.
[147:08.10]You have plenty of time.
[147:24.15]Honey helicopter bit.
[147:25.45]People happy.
[147:26.47]Yeah.
[147:36.10]I might even be able to get in like a plane.
[147:38.98]Like a boat too.
[147:39.98]I was in a boat in the beginning of the game.
[147:41.74]There's still more to see.
[147:53.49]Got it.
[147:59.49]Alright.
[148:00.78]Stop this.
[148:01.22]Here we go.
[148:01.98]Playing Minecraft after this.
[148:03.22]We're playing Minecraft in like two weeks.
[148:16.11]Don't let them flip you!
[148:28.78]Yeah, FTK.
[148:33.03]I'll give you some updates on FTK.
[148:34.43]It is pretty much ready to go.
[148:36.41]We have to do some testing on it.
[148:38.51]Here are some of the things that are going to change.
[148:40.49]I'll tell you right now.
[148:41.35]You ready?
[148:42.67]No aging system.
[148:43.85]No stamina.
[148:45.05]The goal of the game is not just to walk around with a stick and try to kill me.
[148:49.56]No more three month sub requirement because I wasn't streaming for two months, so that would be stupid to have that.
[148:56.27]You have to have been subbed when I wasn't streaming.
[148:58.24]No, you just have to be an active sub.
[149:00.58]It doesn't matter.
[149:01.08]I don't think it matters if you're a community sub or a regular sub.
[149:03.24]It doesn't matter.
[149:13.94]The food, there's no food system.
[149:16.40]It's going to be a full-on adventure that we're going to do with all of us together.
[149:22.86]Should be a lot of fun.
[149:25.25]The rules in the game system has completely changed.
[149:34.57]What's FTK?
[149:35.57]It is Favor the King.
[149:39.14]Favor of the King.
[149:48.73]It'd have to be a two-year sub.
[149:50.41]I don't think there'd be very many people that'd be participating.
[149:56.17]Alright, this is it.
[150:07.68]Is this the end?
[150:12.60]Don't flip over at the very end, please.
[150:16.40]Why are you taking me through this?
[150:23.05]Oh, that was my entire... He just blew my face off.
[150:34.20]How long is this?
[150:39.16]Wait, I thought we were supposed to run people over.
[150:45.61]She has not communicated on radio for a while.
[150:47.53]I don't think that she's still talking to me.
[150:56.81]FINISH IT! FINISH IT! FINISH IT! FINISH IT! FINISH IT! ...
[151:15.81]Dude, is it- does this mission have an end?
[151:23.81]I don't think this mission has an end.
[151:29.49]Come on, dude.
[151:30.35]I don't want to do this again.
[151:31.27]Alright, if I fail this, I'm not doing it again.
[151:32.55]I'm going to the other mission.
[151:36.47]I'm going to piss my pants, too.
[151:37.59]I have to piss really badly.
[151:41.34]You were literally at the end.
[151:44.50]Why would it drive me through a big bunch of tanks?
[151:51.32]Pee pants, pee pants, pee pants.
[151:52.38]Not yet.
[151:58.69]Fuck you.
[152:01.21]Goddammit game, why?
[152:02.51]No, not you guys.
[152:09.74]This.
[152:10.96]This guy.
[152:11.52]Can I repair the car?
[152:22.96]Favor you.
[152:23.94]Yes, that's right.
[152:24.68]Favor you.
[152:25.53]You got it.
[152:26.19]You know the deal.
[152:26.71]When are you gonna play Gex?
[152:31.16]Is it weird that I think that because I've had the 3DO for like 14 months I'm afraid that its internal battery will not turn on like the console just won't turn on because the it's been in a closet for too long Is that possible?
[152:49.72]Did I burn out the internal battery?
[153:06.03]That isn't a thing.
[153:06.81]Okay.
[153:08.17]How old is it?
[153:09.42]Uh, 25 years old or something?
[153:11.44]My GameCube died like that.
[153:16.58]That's what I mean.
[153:17.18]Yeah, you gotta be careful.
[153:18.18]If it could, you never know.
[153:22.22]Okay.
[153:29.88]I'm taking so much damage right now.
[153:32.21]How do you not take this damage?
[153:35.33]I have to drive through this shit.
[153:42.30]The thing's almost dead!
[153:48.22]This thing is almost gonna explode again.
[154:03.49]82%, but what, that meter, that meter was going down.
[154:06.76]That wasn't a health gauge or anything?
[154:10.32]What was that then?
[154:14.19]It's 82, guy.
[154:20.99]Uh-huh.
[154:22.34]Left at the bridge, don't go down the bridge, thank you.
[154:27.84]Don't go off, don't go off, don't go off, don't go off!
[154:29.28]Please don't go off!
[154:30.29]Okay, I'm fine.
[154:31.47]Shhh, I'm good.
[154:31.99]I'm fucking confident and fucking cool.
[154:43.11]Don't land on any rocks.
[154:47.39]Drummer Jack's one.
[154:48.17]Drummer Jack's two.
[154:48.87]Alright, this is where it got hairy last time.
[155:00.96]Is Gex even any fun?
[155:05.06]Gex is the Mario of the 3DO.
[155:08.02]That was their mascot.
[155:08.94]Back then, animals and little fat guys were the mascots.
[155:14.59]Stop talking for a second.
[155:16.17]Jeremy, please, for the love of God, don't speak.
[155:18.03]Just go.
[155:27.64]Get off of... You can't... Am I alright?
[155:32.10]I'm alright.
[155:32.40]I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. I'm okay. ...
[155:45.40]What is he shooting that at? Am I about to beat the missle?
[155:50.40]What was the- that was weird.
[155:51.40]Kill the guy and hijack the tank.
[155:52.40]I don't care about the tank.
[155:56.40]I just want to complete this.
[156:03.34]That oversaturated market.
[156:04.86]That's it, everyone.
[156:11.10]Thank God.
[156:12.26]Park the car inside the garage.
[156:26.47]Alright, I'm not gonna fuck- I can't fuck around right now.
[156:33.80]What if it just explodes?
[156:34.54]What if it... There, see?
[156:35.00]We're good.
[156:47.20]Was that necessary?
[156:48.90]My apologies.
[156:50.09]When I saw that painting of Solano, I overreacted.
[156:53.13]Fiona, this is Eva.
[156:54.21]She's... Beautiful.
[156:55.33]Down, boy.
[156:56.61]Eva is a mechanic.
[156:58.23]Uh-huh.

[158:03.02]Will they all spawn outside?
[158:04.54]Can I do it?
[158:05.82]Zero to 200.
[158:27.81]Jesus.
[158:28.41]Alright.
[158:37.46]Where are they?
[158:52.31]They're just boxes.

[159:01.90]I'll buy one.

[159:14.29]Where do I get the grappling hook?
[159:18.73]You know, I think... I think maybe if this keeps up... Get it right... I have it already.
[159:26.68]Oh.
[159:27.24]Okay.

[159:38.38]Appreciate it.
[159:39.56]Hey, boss.
[159:40.54]I'm just working on this... You know, I'm not even sure what this is.
[159:44.77]That's some free shit for you.
[159:46.05]And some free money for me.
[159:57.37]I want to actually try to do this.
[160:03.65]Don't put me into the water.
[160:05.21]Fucking god damn it.
[160:12.20]Alright, I'm just doing the next... I'm just doing the next mission.
[160:24.59]I'm just going to do the next mission, and we're going to be sick.
[160:31.75]Use cheat codes.
[160:32.41]It's more fun.
[160:33.03]Well, not yet.
[160:35.71]So you tell me I have the grappling hook now?
[160:37.29]I just own it?
[160:37.73]Alright, PMC.
[160:40.58]What other missions are there?
[160:41.94]Stockpile.
[160:46.20]Go to the stockpile.
[160:55.15]Talk to Eva.
[161:03.27]Let's talk.
[161:04.51]Oh, yeah.
[161:04.77]Yes.
[161:04.91]Thank you.
[161:05.17]Oh, I cannot wait.
[161:05.81]Alright.
[161:06.09]Information about Misha.
[161:20.85]Pirates.
[161:21.13]Okay, let's go get him.
[161:21.79]He's up here.
[161:42.28]How am I going to get over there?
[161:45.59]I'm going to have to take a helicopter there to the other thing.
[161:47.73]Alright, let's go take a helicopter.
[161:48.91]Wait, there was five tier two subs?
[161:50.29]There was.
[161:51.47]Paper box.
[161:51.79]Thanks for the five tier two subs.
[161:58.28]That's $10 each for those.
[162:12.51]When people do community subs for tier 2 or tier 3, it's insane.
[162:17.21]That's so much money.
[162:31.32]What's happening?
[162:32.02]Oh, you can fall through the map.
[162:33.86]And it happened again.
[162:34.84]$20,000 down the toilet pool.
[163:05.42]Please, come on.
[163:06.58]Should I go out this side?
[163:08.62]Oh my god, why?
[163:09.00]No, shit.
[163:09.16]There's $30,000 down the drain.
[163:09.72]What am I supposed to do about this?
[163:14.92]I'm supposed to quit.
[163:16.62]You won't lock the FPS?
[163:35.87]No, I don't want to play online.
[163:40.17]I'm taking a piss.
[163:46.20]I can't even leave this.
[163:47.68]I'll be back.
[163:48.14]I'm peeing.
[163:48.76]Bye.
[166:52.28]Okay, I'm back.
[166:52.74]Hello.
[166:52.92]I'm going to try to actually leave the room again.
[167:01.83]For the shot.
[167:02.31]Okay, cool.
[167:06.83]Three, two, wait.
[167:13.06]Just like clockwork.
[167:14.12]I had another dream.
[167:16.40]But I sincerely don't remember what it was.
[167:22.40]Limit the FPS.
[167:23.60]Alright.
[167:24.02]I'm gonna show you this one more time.
[167:25.34]Because people... Look.
[167:28.67]This can't move.
[167:31.97]I cannot move this.
[167:34.17]You hear me?
[167:35.07]Do you?
[167:35.65]Do you hear?
[167:37.51]I can't move it.
[167:39.21]Do it on the main menu.
[167:40.26]I can't.
[167:43.12]Turn on VSync.
[167:44.00]I can't.
[167:44.48]I can't do it.
[167:45.16]I can't.
[167:45.44]Look.
[167:46.80]Oh, I wasn't doing it before.
[167:48.28]I turned this on and everybody fucking hated it.
[167:55.08]Everybody told me this looks like a Snapchat filter.
[167:59.82]What if I was faking it?
[168:05.05]That would be so stupid.
[168:06.15]Alright, I have the information about Misha.
[168:08.33]Okay, good.

[168:38.86]I'll tell you one reason why.
[168:39.86]I think we just got lucky.
[168:42.46]Remember when I came out here before without the limiter and it was fine?

[169:10.41]You can't grapple hook him.
[169:13.39]We're going up here.
[169:19.62]What happened up here?
[169:20.32]Where's my... Where's my helicopter pad?
[169:22.88]What?
[169:26.38]Where's the helicopter pad?

[187:21.93]I wonder if he's still alive.
[187:23.67]I keep thinking if he were here, we could make a lot of money.
[187:33.46]That was a lot.
[187:34.04]That was $300,000.
[187:34.46]Okay.

[189:34.13]Universal Petroleum can kiss my ass.
[189:36.13]I don't care about the oil.
[189:37.25]It's just a paycheck.
[189:39.23]That was a waste?
[189:39.91]Why?
[189:40.45]It's a shotgun.
[189:41.21]Man, they paid me enough.
[189:42.75]I'd take care of this whole mess.
[189:44.55]Oh, you really just kind of... You really just did like the Saturday morning paperboy thing, huh?
[189:50.38]I'm telling you, man.

[191:05.45]Here it comes.
[191:08.15]Alright, can I return it?
[191:09.17]It's the same car as all the other ones.
[191:31.09]Well, this one is mine though, so that's the difference.
[191:35.27]Okay.
[191:42.73]Can I fire from here?
[191:47.78]No.
[191:54.70]Move.

[192:11.28]Kill or capture HVT.
[192:15.82]Gotta verify this guy.
[192:19.10]Keep them alive.
[192:19.97]I'm using a pistol against a fucking heavy machine gun.
[192:51.78]What the fuck?
[192:53.70]Wait, grenade MG!
[192:56.50]What is this?
[192:58.26]Karma, his trips are in choke.
[193:17.13]Alright, where is this dude?
[193:22.75]Is it up there?
[193:24.67]Maybe you just have to go around?
[193:31.82]Alright, I just have to subdue him.
[193:33.70]Don't kill him.
[193:34.26]He's right up here.
[193:40.78]Trying to drive through his house, but that didn't really work.
[193:42.94]Now did it?
[193:46.54]Just get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out!
[193:54.11]Where is he?

[194:56.14]Holy shit, he missed!
[194:58.70]Come here!
[195:14.37]What?
[195:14.77]How do you have that kind of aim?
[195:17.03]Fuck off.
[195:21.18]This is unbelievable.
[195:35.04]First aid.
[195:47.00]Need first aid.
[195:47.86]Oh my god.

[196:11.39]I got him, I got him, I got him, I got him!
[196:40.64]This guy is ruining everything.
[196:45.04]This guy is playing his own video game.
[196:48.13]Alright, I've had enough.
[196:49.23]I've had enough of you, okay?
[196:50.39]Cover me!
[196:56.98]I'm going for the emplaced weapon!
[197:08.83]Where's that guy?
[197:10.43]Extract him!
[197:13.11]I'm going to start screaming.
[197:14.77]I'm going to be mellow.
[197:16.13]You better have that guy ready to load, man.
[197:18.81]I don't get paid extra for this.
[197:22.47]Enemy soldiers approaching!
[197:36.62]Got it.
[197:37.58]One out of ten.
[197:41.84]What am I doing?
[197:44.12]Why am I doing this?
[197:50.70]Can I climb?
[197:52.78]What happens if I- I can't even aim the camera anywhere.
[198:00.74]I can't even- I can't look down.
[198:16.10]All I can do is stop grappling, and I don't think I want to do that.
[198:19.69]Steal this helicopter?
[198:21.01]I can't.
[198:24.97]Drop now.
[198:25.65]I'm over water.
[198:26.31]I don't want to drop in water.
[198:28.55]Wait, where are we going?
[198:31.32]Wait!
[198:32.04]There's another one of those.
[198:33.58]Alright.
[198:33.96]I'm going to get another one of these.
[198:39.28]Wait, why is he going over here?
[198:41.60]Is there a reason why this dude is dropping over here?
[198:46.17]Alright, I'm going to drop right on top of them.
[198:52.10]Assume the escort submission position.
[198:57.40]I can't bear you piece of shit.
[198:59.70]What's up doing?
[199:01.59]I need a medic.
[199:12.03]All dead easy troops.
[199:18.53]Get out of here.
[199:30.87]Okay.
[199:33.13]Come get this one too.
[199:37.45]That's the wrong button.
[199:39.82]Wrong button.
[199:41.08]Wrong button.
[199:41.40]I tried to verify him.
[199:44.00]Take a picture of his dead body apparently.
[199:45.66]Can I pick him up?
[199:54.18]Can you take this instead?
[199:55.16]I'm waiting for him to move.
[200:16.90]They're not going to be mad at me, right?
[200:18.72]Nope.
[200:48.59]or me we must flee for our lives wrong way I mean I have to cross the water that's just a fact is there any way I can cross the water without being in a boat
[201:20.58]That is pretty good.
[201:21.36]That is what somebody would be saying.
[201:27.24]Plane?
[201:33.39]I have to swim.
[201:34.55]Let's just go.
[201:36.35]Drive into the lake.
[201:37.27]I know.
[201:39.45]Just trying to see if there's anything else over here.
[201:42.87]Hold on.
[201:43.87]What is this?
[201:49.93]Who OMEGALUL?
[201:51.33]Who?
[202:02.80]That's exactly what I do when I try to pretend like I'm doing something in Battlefield.
[202:16.79]Battlefield is, it's impossible.
[202:18.31]That game is, I don't know how people play it and do well.
[202:21.79]All I do is just kind of shoot regular bullets at buildings and random tanks and stuff.
[202:26.53]And I just go, well, I'm just kind of participating.
[202:28.25]There's like probably four people playing against three people in Battlefield.
[202:33.56]And then like 55 people are just shooting at random buildings.
[202:39.20]Or just, or they're like one of the five people in the tank that just die from being just shot by anti-tank stuff.
[202:51.81]Alright.
[202:52.15]I got it.
[202:52.53]I actually made it.
[202:53.13]I actually made it here.
[203:01.55]I'm going for the captain.
[203:03.05]Does he have to open the door?
[203:11.27]Wait.
[203:12.01]There he is.
[203:14.35]Open the door.
[203:22.80]Wait, can this guy not stand up in the boat?
[203:27.55]No, no, stop, stop, stop.
[203:28.19]I'm going to let him stand up.
[203:34.69]I'm going to be smacking this guy around.
[203:36.69]It was?
[203:37.19]Well, hell yeah, I did it.
[203:47.80]Destroy this target?
[203:48.88]Oh, alright.
[203:53.38]So... What did I just throw?
[204:08.47]What?
[204:23.53]What happened to the mission I was supposed to do?
[204:25.35]They're fighting somebody!
[204:34.14]Not anymore, they're fighting me.
[204:36.08]I've marked one of the buildings!
[204:41.06]Such a good throw, unbelievable.
[204:42.70]Get me up on- Just get me up!
[204:49.44]Alright, just run.
[204:52.37]We had 10 community subs from Varks and 10 from Really Fungi.
[204:58.31]Really Fungi.
[204:59.23]I was gonna get hit by a car and there it is.
[205:01.93]Thanks for the sub.
[205:08.63]Okay, here we go.
[205:09.61]I've destroyed this building.
[205:10.83]You got it.
[205:11.19]Did I do it from the inside?
[205:37.01]No.
[205:37.41]God damn it.
[205:37.85]I have airstrikes?
[205:41.73]Airstrikes.
[205:42.37]Ooh, artillery strike.
[205:43.72]I'll take it.
[205:44.10]Okay.
[205:49.66]Drop me an artillery strike here.
[205:55.82]Ready?
[205:58.70]Strike it!
[205:59.08]Alright, now get me the fuck off of this dock.
[206:04.81]That's 100k, nice, alright.
[206:30.32]What is this, the division?
[206:31.74]Come on, dude.
[206:41.26]Pretty good.
[206:41.84]Alright, now I can see it.
[206:43.15]Uh, and then 140 gas.
[206:46.11]I don't have enough gas.
[206:47.61]Alright, I gotta go that way.
[206:48.27]I'm going that way.
[206:48.75]Damn, they got me.
[207:02.32]Now, I'm in a big lunch mood right now.
[207:04.24]What do you guys think for lunch?
[207:07.54]What's a lunch that you guys like?
[207:09.56]Tell me a good lunch.
[207:12.39]No, not taquitos.
[207:13.23]That's not a good lunch thing right now.
[207:15.11]No, not steak.
[207:16.27]Not pizza.
[207:17.11]Not McDonald's.
[207:19.97]Ham and Swiss?
[207:20.61]That's not a bad lunch.
[207:24.19]Chickpea fries?
[207:25.05]That sounds amazing.
[207:26.09]I don't know.
[207:26.77]I have to look into that.
[207:32.89]A sub?
[207:33.33]It's good too.
[207:39.51]Old pork sandwich?
[207:42.17]That sounds pretty good too.
[207:42.99]A cheese omelet?
[207:49.02]Hey, hold on a minute.
[207:50.14]How about an omelet with mushrooms in it?
[207:54.62]Mushroom omelet?
[207:55.34]Hmm.
[207:58.56]This is the pirate HQ.
[208:09.65]Western style omelet?
[208:10.63]That sounds good too.
[208:13.61]Is the place I need to go inside of this dome?
[208:15.20]I'm so far away still.
[208:18.64]How did I... If I die, it's going to be so sad.
[208:27.48]Buffalo wings?
[208:28.96]Not into hot sauce right now.
[208:36.31]Why am I swimming?
[208:36.93]Because there's not a boat within 100 meters.
[208:45.37]Eat pure lard.
[208:50.45]Those are jet skis.
[208:52.73]I unlocked the jet ski.
[208:54.61]There they are.
[209:00.50]I'm going to get one.
[209:01.18]Oh, yeah.
[209:04.38]This one right here on the left is ours.
[209:07.11]Drive the little Dimba.
[209:11.27]Move.
[209:12.97]Yep.
[209:14.19]Oh yeah, this is awesome.
[209:25.50]Oh, it's already gone.
[209:45.18]Did you really help me?
[209:46.12]I tipped over!
[209:47.92]Help!
[209:50.56]Is he getting on it?
[210:02.19]Okay.
[210:05.65]Why is he doing this?
[210:18.23]Hi.
[210:20.81]Can we give him a push?
[210:22.97]Alright, I'm gonna give these guys a push.
[210:25.89]We gotta get these guys into the water.
[210:30.64]We're good.
[210:57.52]Okay.
[210:58.46]Once they get in the water, they're gonna be really happy, I promise.
[211:12.49]God damn it.
[211:13.87]Needs to be some other car.
[211:15.93]Don't bump into anybody!
[211:23.65]Get out of the way, move.
[211:27.23]What are you doing?
[211:27.63]Get it- What are you doing?
[211:34.57]Move.
[211:49.14]I can't just drag it into the fucking ocean?
[211:57.44]I need, okay, I need a smaller car.
[212:00.14]Wait, no I don't.
[212:04.13]I can do it with my body.
[212:17.74]God damn it.
[212:18.50]Alright, I need something small.
[212:19.46]Do they have a bike or something?
[212:27.03]It's so close.
[212:27.97]I just have to get it in there.
[212:28.79]Let me try to back into it.
[212:38.96]That's the way.
[212:39.68]That's the strategy.
[212:42.86]That's definitely the way to do it.
[212:44.90]Bingo.
[212:46.14]We got it.
[212:58.12]Someone looked behind me.
[212:58.96]They're going to take off and it's going to be so awesome.
[213:05.79]It'll be worth it.
[213:06.33]They're going to just ride into the sunset.
[213:07.91]Uh-oh.
[213:17.90]Uh-oh.
[213:26.42]They're not dead.
[213:26.90]They're fine.
[213:33.48]Mission success.
[213:35.68]Alright, now go!
[213:36.30]Wait, hold on.
[213:43.89]They're on the truck?
[213:46.79]Wait, why is somebody dead?
[213:47.89]Alright, go!

[215:03.71]You got to give me... I got to try, right?
[215:08.73]What do you want?
[215:09.59]I'm looking for a jet pilot.
[215:11.59]Misha.
[215:12.55]Misha's the jet pilot?
[215:14.06]I am the jet pilot.
[215:15.70]You're the... Who's Misha?
[215:17.54]I am.
[215:18.30]The jet pilot is me.
[215:20.40]Misha is me.
[215:22.41]Jet pilot.
[215:23.39]I fly jets.
[215:25.34]Can I fly a jet?
[215:26.10]I really hope so.
[215:28.34]Wait, is this guy telling me that he's driving drunk in an airplane?
[215:53.84]I used to fly for the Vezenu... That's very bad.
[216:03.49]The VZ.
[216:04.49]I fly for them, but I make mistake.
[216:07.47]Mistake?
[216:08.61]Little mistake.
[216:10.11]I drop bomb in wrong place.
[216:13.19]Big bomb.
[216:14.36]right see you later no no come back was not my fault was lieutenant gives wrong coordinates I drop bomb in right place but is wrong place he tries to blame me guys with big hats come but I show them show them wrong coordinates big heads get mad at lieutenant he gets mad at me now I'm stuck here the lieutenant wants to kill you oh yeah wants to kill me
[216:40.12]But these Jamaicans are so crazy, no one messes with them.
[216:43.62]I'm safe here.
[216:44.64]You'd be safe with me.
[216:45.62]That, oh yeah, would be a great sub sound if I still had one.
[216:53.06]Pooch?
[216:56.46]Where is this guy?
[216:58.12]Lieutenant is in bunker.
[216:59.40]You know where the bunker is?
[217:00.82]I know where the bunker is.
[217:02.48]Right, so you need a bunker buster.
[217:04.60]I have no bunker buster.
[217:05.91]That's where I come in.
[217:07.05]You, you already came in.
[217:09.67]I'm saying I'll get you a bunker buster.
[217:12.25]Didn't I pick one of those up already?
[217:13.71]And point a little laser thingy so I hit the target and we're in business.
[217:18.68]I think I already got one.
[217:19.54]You mean the designator?
[217:20.72]Yeah, it's too hard to hit target without it.
[217:24.22]Alright, I help you bomb this VZ lieutenant back to the Stone Age and you'll be free to come work for me.
[217:29.76]Yeah, simple, no?
[217:33.57]Yeah.
[217:35.11]Solve Misha's problem by taking out the lieutenant who is mad at him.
[217:38.13]You'll need a bunker buster.
[217:41.11]Two artillery strikes, two anacondas, two piranha boats.
[217:48.82]Let's get it.
[217:50.10]Let's go!
[217:51.04]I want to scream it so bad, but I can't.
[218:10.57]Alright, I need Bunker Buster.
[218:11.81]I also need other shit too.
[218:12.87]But I'm not... I don't have... Didn't it say I needed to get a bunch of other shit too?
[218:18.66]Alright, well let's go.
[218:24.34]The other shit is optional.
[218:26.46]Oh, okay.
[218:27.46]That sounds like fun.
[218:28.40]I'll do that.
[218:40.39]Bunker Buster.
[218:46.36]Bunker Buster.
[218:47.46]Fun.
[218:49.32]Feels amazing, man.
[218:50.56]Yeah.
[218:51.32]Alright, we're just gonna go straight ahead.
[218:57.04]I wish you could shoot.
[219:04.97]Instead of just drive.
[219:09.04]But hey, I mean, you can't fault them.
[219:10.48]There is drivable vehicles.
[219:19.68]Vehicle sounds are whack.
[219:22.60]Yeah, they kind of are.
[219:29.55]They're whack.
[219:34.87]Alright, gotta extract three of them.
[219:36.31]Do I have gas for this, though?
[219:39.81]I only have 70 gas.
[219:40.99]Is that enough?
[219:42.61]I have to steal a gas thing.
[219:49.94]There's gas right here.
[219:55.34]Is there a gas thing?
[219:56.24]There's no gas thing to take.
[220:02.56]I'm not sure I'm going to be able to do this.
[220:11.87]Mosquito.
[220:13.71]That does kind of sound like a mosquito.
[220:16.17]When they get really close to your ear and you have an extreme panic attack.
[220:20.29]Because for some reason you just think that the mosquito is going to go into your ear and crawl into your brain.
[220:26.34]And start sucking blood out of your brain and shit.
[220:28.12]Yeah, no.
[220:33.38]I want one of those so bad.
[220:35.62]Wait, this wasn't even close.
[220:36.62]Oh, it's the next island.
[220:37.44]It's this one here.
[220:37.92]Okay.
[220:47.05]Laying eggs in your brain.
[220:48.29]Alright, has there ever been a recorded case of a bug laying eggs in somebody's brain?
[220:57.80]Has that ever happened, or is that an irrational fear that, like, Eli Roth made up?
[221:05.22]Has that actually happened?
[221:15.19]Look it up.
[221:26.01]I don't think I want to look that up.
[221:26.99]That does not sound like something I want to see.
[221:28.73]Alright, let's get rid of these guys.
[221:38.84]That's a big gun.
[221:40.00]You know what?
[221:43.34]I want you to get on it.
[221:43.96]Well, you don't want to get on it.
[221:48.67]Fine.
[221:49.09]I'll get on it.
[221:51.67]Okay, what is this?
[221:56.59]105 millimeter artillery rifle.
[222:03.30]There's a fucking tank over here.
[222:14.80]Oh my god.
[222:15.62]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[222:19.10]Give me, give me, give me.
[222:36.72]We're good!
[222:37.78]Okay.
[222:39.34]Now we just have to get up here and destroy all this shit.
[222:47.72]Not that, but you get the idea.
[222:56.87]Collateral damage?
[222:57.85]If you have to hurt civilians, that's fine.
[223:00.45]But it costs us every time you do.
[223:04.47]I need to disable that AA so Ewan can extract the munitions.
[223:08.75]That was easy.
[223:09.21]Anything else you need me to do?
[223:12.77]Wait, there's gas over there too.
[223:14.93]That was a very large explosion.
[223:25.74]You gonna play Destroy All Humans?
[223:27.84]Unfortunately, no.
[223:29.48]Because I played the original Destroy All Humans.
[223:34.16]right before they announced that they were remaking the game.
[223:37.90]So I'm one of those guys.
[223:41.76]Alright, this is it.
[223:49.46]Don't get into a fight around the Bunker Busters.
[223:51.31]The Bunker Busters are going to explode.
[223:54.25]Well, don't bring the tank.
[223:58.87]Demon's Souls remake?
[224:02.77]Um...
[224:19.04]Oh.
[224:24.86]Don't shoot that buster.
[224:26.24]Don't shoot the buster.
[224:27.57]I got to kill these guys right now.
[224:45.68]Don't get it
[225:15.34]Do not!
[225:16.50]Don't blow him up.
[225:20.22]Got it, okay, got stash one.
[225:30.30]I'm going, I'm gonna go up.
[225:34.10]I can't, it's too much to process.
[225:35.54]The guy that just fell, tripped to his death after being so ecstatic to go get the tank.
[225:43.33]Oh, that's where this is coming from, okay.
[226:03.80]Oh my god.
[226:04.70]Who is sounding the alarm?
[226:08.60]Alright, we got one more up here and that's it.
[226:14.24]He's gonna get it.
[226:14.90]Is there anybody even down here?
[226:35.08]Shit, I need... Alright, it's busy, it's busy, busy, busy, busy, busy.
[226:44.03]Let's go.
[226:44.39]Hurry up.
[226:48.07]Get that shit out of here.
[227:03.00]I'll get it one day.
[227:08.53]Alright, that's three out of three.
[227:22.21]The music's not that bad.
[227:23.21]Alright.
[227:29.07]I have the Bunker Busters.
[227:30.31]Now I can destroy the bunker.
[227:35.64]Airstrikes.
[227:36.24]Bunker Buster.
[227:42.88]How much does it cost?
[227:46.00]Alright, Bunker Buster is 300 gas.
[227:48.80]I don't have that.
[227:49.34]I gotta get gas.
[227:52.28]There's one right here.
[227:58.17]Is there a heli-
[228:14.26]Quick, get in, get in.
[228:17.15]Okay, can I- I fly this?
[228:24.53]Wait, I have a bomb.
[228:27.37]I missed.
[228:31.02]That's sad.
[228:38.84]I need- wait, I gotta get gas, man.
[228:40.91]I can't have, like, a fun time.
[228:46.06]Look, I have to bunker bust this guy.
[228:48.26]I hear lots of luck on... Get out, I gotta get out.
[229:28.66]I need these!
[229:38.53]Whoa!
[229:40.45]That guy's gonna die before he shoots my guy!
[229:42.25]Die die die die die die die die die!
[229:47.85]It's alright, I don't care, just get the gas.
[229:50.43]Go, go, go, go, just go!
[229:51.45]What's in the way?
[229:52.15]Nothing's in the way, go!
[229:53.87]Nothing's in the way!
[229:55.43]Fly!
[229:56.31]Is it too heavy?
[229:57.16]Did you bring the wrong car?
[229:59.44]You fucking idiot.
[230:03.26]He's good, he's good, he's good, he's okay, he's okay.
[230:06.14]He's gonna make it.
[230:08.56]He's gonna make it, he's gonna make it.
[230:10.54]Come on, make it!
[230:13.46]He just bumped into the... What are you doing?
[230:18.27]Fly this thing out of here!
[230:26.23]How did they hit each other in the air?
[230:29.12]It's still fucking following him.
[230:30.64]Did he get it?
[230:32.16]Nice, he did.
[230:33.58]Alright.
[230:35.28]Why is he coming back here?
[230:37.42]What are you doing?
[230:38.84]Why?
[230:39.42]Excuse me.
[230:40.98]Okay, I thought he was driving directly into me.
[230:45.26]That was, that was manga-esque.
[230:49.82]Wait, I have full gas.
[230:51.45]Alright, now I just gotta... Artillery strike.
[231:04.39]Artillery strike times one?
[231:18.07]What does it mean to... No, no, no, no, no.
[231:20.15]It's Bunker Buster.
[231:20.89]There it is.
[231:22.67]How do I use it?
[231:24.85]Oh, no.
[231:26.27]Oh, my God.
[231:26.95]Oh, my God.
[231:27.27]Oh, my God.
[231:27.55]Oh, my God.
[231:27.84]Oh, my God.
[231:28.12]Oh, my God.
[231:28.46]Why?
[231:28.74]Why?
[231:28.92]Why?
[231:29.08]Why?
[231:29.24]Why?
[231:29.44]Why?
[231:29.62]Why?
[231:29.94]What do I do?
[231:32.30]I have to aim the laser at this.
[231:37.28]Oh, this is bad.
[231:38.88]This is very bad.
[231:39.51]Can I put this away?
[231:40.23]Okay, I can put it away, right?
[231:44.47]I can't put it away.
[231:59.62]Why do you have to do this shit right now?
[232:03.72]Okay.
[232:20.46]What?
[232:21.90]What's going on?
[232:22.60]What's with the angle?
[232:24.06]Okay, this is it.
[232:30.56]Ready?
[232:30.74]Ready?
[232:32.70]We're good.
[232:32.96]We're okay.
[232:33.56]We're okay.
[232:34.08]We're not going to take any damage from the fall.
[232:36.57]Okay, we're fine.
[232:44.91]I'm so sorry.
[232:46.15]That was loud, but that was fucking ridiculous.
[232:49.71]Okay, I just have to aim the laser.
[232:54.06]Aim the laser.
[232:56.26]Aim the laser.
[232:58.42]Bunker buster.
[232:59.40]Here we go.
[233:00.48]There's a tank right here.
[233:01.40]Uh, okay.
[233:10.64]We're going the other way.
[233:11.72]But wait, I need to heal.
[233:24.41]Need that health.
[233:29.05]Okay, here we go.
[233:29.73]It's right there.
[233:32.31]Bunkers right here.
[233:33.11]Okay, eat shit.
[233:56.09]me the where's the fucking bunker buster dude right there I gotta get out of here
[234:25.24]Alright, stop firing up here.
[234:32.33]I'm in it.
[234:32.85]I'm inside the... Stop firing, stop firing.
[234:36.93]I'm good.
[234:38.85]Yeah, I told you guys I was gonna get it.
[234:44.25]Found a jet pilot.
[234:45.33]A pilot?
[234:46.39]He looks like cargo.
[234:47.87]It passed out after he landed.
[234:49.89]That's convenient.
[234:51.17]Hey, I know this guy.
[234:52.33]He flies jets.
[234:53.13]Dude, I don't know why.
[234:53.91]I fly jets.
[234:55.15]Okay, I just remembered from the very beginning of the game when I drove the bike like a thousand miles per hour into the gate.
[235:01.66]It's making me laugh right now.
[235:02.76]He's always drunk.
[235:03.76]I need drink.
[235:05.48]He can barely stand.
[235:07.56]Don't need to stand to fly jet.
[235:10.95]Okay, so what does he do for me now?
[235:12.33]Wasted.
[235:38.73]What, he just died on the couch?
[235:40.21]He had like a heart attack?
[235:40.99]Hello.
[235:41.17]If you find more bunker busters, he can drop them for you.
[235:45.31]Oh, that's awesome.
[236:08.94]Alright, where is he?
[236:09.50]Am I going the right way?
[236:11.10]Go wake him up.
[236:13.18]Is he in the bedroom?
[236:21.88]There are a lot of bombs in this.
[236:24.55]It feels like there are.
[236:32.57]You're pretending.
[236:35.47]Um...
[236:37.39]Um, what?
[236:38.61]Where is he?
[236:40.65]It's not this guy.
[236:41.71]Didn't he say he was up here?
[236:42.86]Oh, okay.
[236:43.70]Well, what the fuck are you doing over here?
[236:44.96]You can get a literal nuke.
[236:57.80]How do I get this?
[236:58.36]Okay.
[236:58.46]When do I get new clothes?
[237:25.91]What is going on?
[237:27.57]Oh, it's you.
[237:28.74]Hi, boss.
[237:30.68]Cheat codes, cheat codes, cheat codes.
[237:32.38]Hold on.
[237:35.32]How's life in war-torn Venice?
[237:40.18]Jennifer has a catapult?
[237:43.08]Really?
[237:43.30]You need to complete challenges.
[237:47.98]Oh.
[237:48.34]I don't think we can afford more than three recruits.
[237:51.40]Maybe if all this works out, we can expand after this job.
[237:55.07]So what is the next job?
[237:56.13]What's the goal here?
[237:57.21]Does somebody have a new mission here?
[238:07.20]Challenge, destruction, race.
[238:08.52]It's just a bunch of challenges.
[238:13.64]Do the Moab cheat.
[238:14.66]It's the up logo.
[238:23.92]Alright, let's go here.
[238:30.38]You'll... It's gonna be New Vegas.
[238:34.29]How do you put the cheats in?
[238:35.19]Is it some weird thing in the menu or something in the... Like an INI file or something?
[238:39.39]I don't know.
[238:47.54]Come pick me up.
[238:51.00]Always counting on me to come save your bacon.
[239:01.36]Feats don't work on PC.
[239:03.23]Will that be... Really?
[239:13.95]Why not?
[239:14.29]Alright, let's go into the...
[239:28.45]He missed.
[239:29.71]He missed really- This guy has a sniper rifle?
[239:32.17]I'm just gonna go get it.
[239:35.37]That dude has a huge rifle.
[239:40.59]Look at this thing.
[239:41.79]Why is there a sniper up here?
[239:50.35]How do these- How do they even get up here though?
[239:54.79]Alright, let's go.
[239:55.43]Level the up building?
[239:57.01]That's pretty clever.
[239:58.48]How far away is this part of the building?
[240:26.73]Does he know he can destroy skyscrapers yet?
[240:28.57]Nope.
[240:31.69]Just found that out right now.
[240:33.69]By you.
[240:36.83]What's happening around here?
[240:39.23]Christ!
[240:39.91]They're coming out of the woodwork.
[240:41.50]Advancing!
[240:42.54]You're near one of the VV occupied buildings.
[240:46.38]I don't care though.
[240:49.02]But what if I don't care?
[240:50.02]Need to take out that 50 cap.
[240:56.72]No, no.
[240:57.24]This is not what I want.
[240:57.96]I'm going to do the next mission.
[240:59.91]Blow the building up.
[241:01.33]Nice try.
[241:01.61]Nice try.
[241:25.57]Holy shit, he shot it into the camera.
[241:31.37]How can you be better with a rocket launcher than I am with a sniper rifle?
[241:35.11]I don't get it.
[241:42.98]Jump scare.
[241:48.08]This is a friendly tank right here, though.
[241:52.06]That was a 3D movie.
[241:54.00]Okay, if you take, if you make that a little bit red and then you make another one, copy it right next to each other, make it a little bit blue, and then you, like in Photoshop or something, you move it close together so it's that stereoscopic 3D, right?
[242:08.49]Somebody will do it.
[242:17.47]This could be the most roundabout way to go in the front door that I've ever seen in my fucking entire life.
[242:33.33]It's the Merc.
[242:35.06]Let me in.
[242:36.00]I'm ready for my next job.

[243:11.12]I'm in.
[243:12.12]Count your blessings.
[243:14.60]There's active activity of PDA during gameplay.
[243:21.49]If you like the motorcycles in this, you need to get the Panzer cycle.
[243:24.89]This is an outpost contract, which means you'll need to take over an outpost
[243:32.72]What is it?
[243:35.14]LBRBRBLBRB?
[243:37.66]LBRBLBLBLB?
[243:39.64]Somebody's got it, right?
[243:41.56]I'm not going to use it very much.
[243:47.06]Hold on.
[243:55.76]I don't think that worked.
[243:57.98]LB, what is it?

[244:34.82]Oh, no, no, no.
[244:35.30]That means when we get there.
[244:36.14]I'm going to take a tank, though.
[244:43.91]How far away is this?
[244:44.81]Not that far, but I can't... I have to just swim over there, don't I?
[244:50.95]Why are you holding a sniper rifle as a pistol?
[245:04.25]All in the strike team.
[245:05.09]Not until we... It says wait till we get close.
[245:15.39]Is it not gonna... Is it dropping the water?
[245:29.04]Wait.
[245:29.82]I thought it... I thought it said I couldn't do that.
[245:33.79]They actually drop?
[245:34.63]I just wanna see what it does.
[245:39.87]Let's go.
[245:44.35]Wow, I have my own team.
[245:45.61]This is awesome.
[245:47.17]This just became so much more fun.
[245:49.05]Okay, can you guys swim?
[245:51.47]Please say yes or no.
[245:54.82]It's like I'm so excited.

[246:11.12]Are you guys coming?
[246:32.11]Why are they not coming anymore?
[246:36.83]That was not the worst noise of 2020, please.
[246:39.66]Okay, well I don't- who cares about the strike team?
[246:47.28]They don't move.
[246:47.88]I have like five of them.
[246:53.93]That was a medium worst noise?
[247:02.69]Do you have a gauge that tells you how bad or good a noise is?
[247:14.27]Yes, you do.
[247:15.07]Okay.
[247:15.25]Well, there is criteria.

[252:45.82]Ah!
[252:48.34]I mean, that wasn't even that bad.

[253:04.34]Alright, let's get everybody in a pickup truck again.

[253:18.20]The enemy is here!
[253:22.06]Okay, we're all gonna get into this thing.
[253:26.88]The enemy is here!
[253:29.45]Don't need too many soldiers in the area.
[253:31.01]Freaking VZs running amok.
[253:33.09]These shoes cost more than you can imagine.
[253:44.38]I think these guys have been glitched since the very beginning of the game.
[253:49.09]I'm pretty certain of that.
[253:50.03]Alright, wait, I can do- I can take a helicopter, right?
[253:53.11]What?
[253:53.49]It's not- it's not a grenade!
[254:01.40]It's not a grenade!
[254:02.68]It's not a grenade!
[254:03.56]It's not a grenade!
[254:19.48]It's not a grenade.
[254:23.14]Right here.
[254:29.88]You were aiming a sniper rifle at an innocent person.
[254:31.96]No, I wasn't.
[254:34.04]I was just using him as binoculars to see what was going on around me.
[254:37.07]Alright, we're good.
[254:40.75]Alright, we need a car and I want a strike team.
[254:46.84]This just added another, like, hour of content to the game for me.
[254:50.56]Strike team in the sedan.
[255:00.49]What?
[255:08.33]You... I can't... Alright, I have to pay attention.
[255:13.29]I can't even read that.
[255:22.41]That was a direct hit.
[255:41.29]That was loud too.
[255:42.47]Alright, here we go.
[255:45.27]You guys ready?
[255:47.09]Let's get the strike team here.

[256:46.78]No, you gotta get in the... Why did you go over here?
[256:49.90]It's only one guy in here.

[258:50.27]Behind that sweatshirt?
[258:59.59]He's playing on easy?
[259:04.76]There's no such thing as easy.
[259:07.48]There is only game.
[259:16.06]I just have to stand next to it, don't I?
[259:21.50]Yeah, just have to go like this.
[259:31.45]Oh shit.
[259:43.04]Strike team!
[259:54.26]Alright, I'm right there with the checkpoint.
[260:00.38]You heal for two while flying through the air.
[260:02.38]Fuck.

[260:14.75]I didn't... No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[260:18.11]I didn't want to do... I was trying to...

[260:30.57]Alright, so the goal is you... Okay, here's what you have to do.
[260:33.99]You gotta get your guys.
[260:36.29]Don't just drop them and then go in.
[260:37.73]You have to drop them in the front.
[260:39.81]How do you feel about Kim admitting to being a paid actress?
[260:49.80]Well, theGerma985.
[260:51.46]I wonder how long that username is going to last.
[261:06.16]Well, I mean, how am I supposed to feel?
[261:10.42]Like, don't act like on Twitter where you didn't get to be your name, so you just put the in front of it, so now you're the real one.
[261:21.18]Nope.
[261:40.60]I gotta fly.
[261:41.98]I gotta fly.
[261:44.22]Let's fly, whatever.
[261:55.25]Is Kim a paid actress?
[261:56.27]No, if you don't stop saying that, I'm gonna flip out.
[261:58.08]If you guys don't stop saying that, I'm gonna flip out.
[262:06.44]Sure, I'll drop you off.
[262:07.80]It's what you pay me to think.
[262:12.07]Keep saying it.
[262:12.75]Don't say that!
[262:13.75]You're gonna make me flip out!
[262:27.75]Why are you shooting a rocket launcher in your own base?
[262:32.95]It almost looks like he accidentally turned that on.
[262:35.81]Alright, enough.
[262:37.02]It's time.
[262:54.31]So you don't pay her.
[262:57.39]No!
[262:58.77]You're gonna make me flip out!
[263:10.22]Hey, they're making me flip out.
[263:11.58]I say, this is like, I get the guy.
[263:13.00]I know you guys just want me to come in here and just flip out, you know?
[263:18.00]It's not going to happen, man.
[263:27.63]You're stealing my ride.

[287:45.51]That's... Is that like an elite?
[287:48.53]That's like a cracked copy of the game.
[287:55.67]I don't want to download a cracked EXE of the game.

[297:37.29]It's because the mouse is on the screen.
[298:11.89]He might be broken though.
[298:12.73]There you go.
[298:13.61]It's so tempting to just go wicked fast, but I can't kill this guy.
[298:42.21]Get in there!
[298:43.33]Bring an executive to the first site.
[298:45.49]Get on the deck?
[298:46.35]Oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[298:51.45]Comedian Jerma?
[299:18.88]Did you see all the shit that flew all the way to the right?
[299:20.88]Were those bodies?
[299:26.43]That was kind of... That was ridiculous.
[299:27.87]That looked like straw.
[299:28.79]That didn't even look like people.
[299:46.89]This is simple.
[299:57.11]Why can I not kill this guy?
[299:58.53]Oh!
[300:02.03]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[300:11.28]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[300:22.63]I can't shoot in the middle of there.
[300:24.05]I can't shoot here.
[300:30.00]I have to take care of that.
[300:41.24]Fuck.
[300:42.20]Oh, he got in.
[300:42.79]Is somebody behind me?
[300:53.07]Get out of here, man!
[300:56.25]I have a bad feeling that this guy's gonna get in the way and I'm going to shoot this guy in the head.
[301:00.94]He's gonna lean up.
[301:17.17]That was friendly fire.
[301:18.17]Yeah, it was.
[301:19.85]Unfortunately.
[301:48.00]or anything.
[301:48.50]Wait, are there more coming?
[302:00.84]Why don't they get up here?
[302:04.38]Am I right?
[302:14.06]Bring executive!
[302:14.90]Bring executive!
[302:18.95]Come on, come on, executive!
[302:23.64]Get on the bike!
[302:32.58]Get on the bike, get on the bike!
[302:43.37]Good, good, good!
[302:49.05]Oh my goodness.
[302:53.78]Oh my goodness.
[302:55.30]Get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off.
[303:13.06]It's a checkpoint.
[303:13.72]Don't worry.
[303:17.91]I've been shot!
[303:21.88]Okay, no bike this time.
[303:37.46]Get on!
[303:41.48]Wait, can he drive?
[303:47.93]Will he drive the car?
[303:51.23]Oh, really?
[303:51.81]That's really unfortunate.
[304:02.24]He won't get on the gun?
[304:02.96]Okay.
[304:14.51]We're good.
[304:15.05]They're approaching the warehouse.
[304:17.61]This is just what we're gonna have to do.
[304:24.33]Return to objective.
[304:43.34]Aren't I on the way to the objective?
[304:47.68]Thought I was on the way to the objective.
[304:57.78]Okay, same deal.
[304:59.02]I'll work as fast as I can.
[305:00.61]You keep them away from me.
[305:02.23]Okay, site two.
[305:03.95]Here they come.
[305:05.03]Cover the north road.
[305:06.85]Enemy sighted.
[305:08.89]Enemy sighted.
[305:17.04]Why am I doing that?
[305:32.10]They're all getting out of the back.
[305:33.76]Don't let them get out of the back.
[305:36.36]Oh shit.
[305:39.32]You alright?
[305:39.80]Everyone's alright.
[305:46.19]When am I going to play Naughty Bear?
[305:50.39]I'm not going to play Naughty Bear.
[306:10.01]Nice.
[306:10.45]We've tossed that.
[306:11.13]Good job.
[306:20.18]That was a lot of lag.
[306:23.16]From the east and west.
[306:34.21]Oh shit.
[306:41.91]Oh shit.
[306:45.60]The framerate is so bad.
[307:07.05]What the fuck?
[307:09.09]Oh my god.
[307:12.21]What else do I need to do?
[307:13.41]Oh fuck!
[307:18.13]No!
[307:18.51]There goes one of the guns!
[307:36.91]Yeah, it crashed.
[307:50.16]Put it on 30 FPS for that?
[307:51.92]Fuck.
[307:54.68]Oh, I want to ride around with the executive.
[307:57.12]I want to get him to- I have to win.
[307:58.80]But how far- There's a- I had a checkpoint, right?
[308:02.58]I gotta put it on 30 FPS.
[308:18.00]Come on.
[308:18.42]It's going to be right at that checkpoint.
[308:31.47]You need a better PC, clearly, if you can't play a poop game from 20 years ago.
[308:34.87]This is not a poop game.
[308:36.85]This is 2008.
[308:37.49]TF2 came out a year before this.
[308:45.45]Bingo.
[308:57.98]Let's get in an armored car, please.
[309:07.14]Nothing even loaded in.
[309:07.98]This is perfect.
[309:09.52]What kind of Pentium do I have?
[309:16.35]A Pentium 2.
[309:20.61]Dual core Pentium 2.
[309:23.10]Everyone, that's all you needed.
[309:24.04]Man.
[309:25.22]What are you going to need in like 20 years?
[309:28.54]We're going to be getting laughed at.
[309:34.23]Years and years from now.
[309:43.99]Like 6 core, 8 core, 12 core, that's crazy.
[309:47.46]Two CPUs and one motherboard, that's insane.
[309:52.14]That shit'll be in your brain.
[309:54.36]In like 50 years.
[309:55.78]Alright, here we go.
[310:00.90]Alright, just wait till they get out.
[310:09.19]There's really no sense in destroying the vehicles at all.
[310:14.00]It's just too much particle effects.
[310:15.88]It just ruins everything.
[310:16.76]Shoot the people.
[310:19.38]Alright, good.
[310:30.01]I would love to attack this guy.
[310:45.77]Let's get in the tank.
[310:58.84]East and west?
[310:59.52]Alright, hold on, not yet.
[311:04.90]Good.
[311:05.30]Okay, gotta move, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[311:17.20]Alright, west.
[311:26.92]Blanket, blanket.
[311:28.42]Excuse me, you on the 50 cal.
[311:30.02]What?
[311:34.49]What?
[311:44.15]Oh, shit.
[311:45.11]That guy has a...
[311:56.67]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[312:01.18]Is there an enemy over here?
[312:02.16]Oh, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[312:07.20]I need a gun, I need a gun, I need a gun, I need a gun, I need a gun, I need a gun!
[312:09.97]I need to take out that gun.
[312:29.06]Helicopter's dropping off a heavy weapon for you.
[312:30.42]Wait for it on the roof.
[312:31.04]How high is this?
[312:33.44]The health pack?
[312:33.92]You can do better than that.
[313:03.51]Anti-air kit.
[313:04.81]Alright, what is it?
[313:11.40]Anti-air missile.
[313:17.26]That's to destroy... Okay, we're going to lock on.
[313:32.75]Get out of here.
[313:34.01]I'm done.
[313:35.49]Any more?
[313:35.95]Fine.
[314:02.10]Man, this shit.
[314:08.28]You missed that one.
[314:17.57]I wanna do like a- a- a helicopter fight.
[314:23.15]Wait, can I pick him up in this?
[314:29.27]Wait, that was the building he was in, right?
[314:44.26]Can I pick... This is so awkward to drive around in.
[314:51.52]Alright, get in!
[315:01.66]I have to tell him to follow me.
[315:03.94]Alright, follow, follow, follow, follow, follow!
[315:06.32]Wait, is he piloting?
[315:23.19]Oops.
[315:27.41]That's not an up building, right?
[315:30.01]Okay, thank god it went over it.
[315:36.85]Oh dear lord, that was so close.
[315:40.25]there alive you almost didn't whatever you've got solano sure as hell wants to get his hands on ah it's mostly just stuff showing how we've been screwing the venezuelans out of their oil you must be proud of yourself
[315:54.51]You have no idea.
[315:56.31]We had them paying us for their own oil.
[315:59.99]But I guess that's over now.
[316:01.53]Back to Texas for me.
[316:03.29]Oh, you don't like Venezuela?
[316:05.47]47 voice, yeah.
[316:06.82]I could have this whole thing with Solano wrapped up in an hour from my office.
[316:09.68]Hold on a second.
[316:10.48]There's like a bounty here.
[316:12.00]See how they're going to screw us next.
[316:15.24]Where is this dude?
[316:17.00]What?
[316:19.03]You think I'm stupid?
[316:21.37]Where's this guy?
[316:22.51]Oh well.
[316:23.11]Destroy the building?
[316:51.99]Wish I had that missile.
[316:52.99]That'd be great.
[316:53.81]Just wait.
[316:54.29]Okay, C4.
[316:54.75]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[316:55.59]C4 on the building.
[316:58.03]And then we get in and then I can detonate it.
[317:01.80]Right?
[317:02.00]Does that make sense?
[317:05.04]Finish the job first.
[317:07.18]Oh, right, right, right.
[317:07.88]You're right.
[317:08.18]Do the mission.
[317:08.74]That's true.
[317:39.30]Safe.
[317:48.44]Helipads are for nerds.
[317:50.58]Helipads are for incredibly rich people.
[317:55.17]I mean, you can be a nerd and be rich.
[318:05.63]But you gotta be rich to have a helipad.
[318:07.23]That's just the way it is.
[318:07.97]2.4 mil.
[318:15.09]Alright, I'm taking my heli- lookit, I can- I'm gonna go down there.
[318:34.90]Save?
[318:35.22]Okay.
[318:38.91]Yeah, so, uh, the next game we're gonna play is probably Desperados 3.
[318:44.95]I played Desperados 2 and I loved it.
[318:46.37]I made a video on it.
[318:55.06]End of the stream voice?
[318:56.06]Not quite.
[318:56.94]No, not yet.
[319:07.05]But Desperados should be really fun.
[319:10.61]If it's anything like Desperados 2, that was a lot of fun as well.
[319:15.09]How high can I go?
[319:16.25]Finish LA Noire.
[319:17.07]That was like three years ago.
[319:50.81]But just finish it.
[319:54.70]Okay.
[320:00.26]I want you guys to just... We'll take bets.
[320:03.22]Do you think from the highest point in a helicopter falling onto the ground is going to kill me?
[320:09.56]If it does, the stream is over.
[320:12.14]If it doesn't, then I'll do the mission.
[320:13.56]This road runs all the way around the lake.
[320:18.84]West takes you to America.
[320:21.51]We want Naughty Bear.
[320:25.83]You don't want Naughty Bear!
[320:31.01]What's that?
[320:31.41]Am I being swarmed right now by other aircraft?
[320:55.18]You're entering the eastern side of the Amazons in Venezuela.
[320:58.38]You won't find much on the main roads around here, but all you have to do is travel off the beaten path, and you'll find all kinds of hidden VZ and guerrilla activity.
[321:06.68]This is really far away.
[321:07.90]Shit.
[321:10.04]All the way at the top of the mountain.
[321:16.03]People who want Naughty Bear are the same people who want Ratatouille.
[321:18.61]They want it for the memes for like three minutes, and then they leave when he actually plays the game.
[321:30.52]Yep.
[321:31.40]Sounds about right to me.
[321:32.98]Alright, here we go.
[321:36.69]Does this kill me?
[321:37.81]Yes or no?
[321:38.37]We'll find out.
[321:38.99]Here we go.
[321:42.67]And then they come back, four hours later, and they go, Holy shit, he's still playing this game?
[321:48.37]Yeah.
[321:50.83]That was the plan.
[321:51.81]Here we go.
[321:56.77]I love skydiving.
[322:19.62]We're good.
[322:32.09]We gotta do the mission now.
[322:33.05]Ooh, okay.
[322:34.35]River outpost.
[322:35.99]Wait, here's a shop.
[322:52.84]Scout?
[322:54.20]Ooh.
[322:56.06]Transport.
[322:57.58]Sure, I'll just take one.
[323:00.06]Why not?
[323:00.42]Sure.
[323:06.14]Rifle, grenades, and ammunition.
[323:10.38]Hmm.
[323:13.24]Alright, we need to... Sure.
[323:18.97]Who gives a crap?
[323:21.38]Hey, who gives a crap anyways?
[323:22.90]Yeah, this is just cause.
[323:30.70]Good.
[323:30.94]I'll take it, buddy.
[324:00.63]The same fucking thing.
[324:01.13]Where is this?
[324:02.25]Here it is.
[324:02.85]It's fine.
[324:03.05]It's fine.
[324:03.25]It's fine.
[324:05.73]We're here.
[324:05.97]We're here.
[324:06.21]We're here.
[324:06.43]We're here.
[324:06.65]Here. Here. Here. Here.
[324:08.65]The same fucking thing.
[324:10.75]Here it is, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine. We're here.
[324:13.75]Jerma you should play Mercenaries 2. Ban that guy for 2 minutes.
[324:20.75]Down here! I got our wheels back.
[324:30.04]Oh, you're gone.
[324:31.66]Whatever.
[324:49.26]Get on.
[324:49.50]Nobody get on.
[324:50.18]I want a friend.
[324:59.04]Bye, bike.
[324:59.34]There you go.
[325:00.88]Nice.
[325:02.74]He's dead?
[325:04.98]How did he die?
[325:08.42]Bullshit.
[325:33.46]Wait, this is the same mission from before, it's just different people.
[325:40.98]Is there any difference at all?
[325:45.93]Shot himself.
[326:02.95]That's ours.
[326:03.41]I'm afraid.
[326:09.13]Oh shit, I crushed him.
[326:11.49]What?
[326:32.73]We need one more guy?
[327:03.06]One more!
[327:03.32]You got it!
[327:03.66]Alright, is there any...
[327:37.55]Is there anything else to do?
[327:38.49]Oh, should we end it?
[327:40.91]I mean, I had a lot of fun.
[327:44.71]This was fun for like about five or six hours.
[327:54.36]Cheat now?
[327:59.47]Is it actual cheats or are you guys actually making that up?
[328:02.89]Hold L and R and then do start, up A, left A. I don't, I, that's, I went by too fast.
[328:10.35]If you have a feeling a little bit lost, come back.
[328:23.03]Activate cheats, hold L and R, and do start up A, left- ahaha, yeah, that's funny.
[328:32.02]Almost.
[328:33.00]Close.
[328:33.78]No.
[328:45.71]Oh, LB up A, A again, quit game.
[328:49.37]That- yeah, that would've been great.
[329:05.64]Um... Guys?
[329:10.31]Why did you do that?
[329:14.43]That's a friendly.
[329:25.67]How do you even time that missile to land on me like that?
[329:28.03]That was fucking crazy.
[329:31.61]Alright, let's... I want to blow... Let's get a building.
[329:35.22]I need to try that.
[329:43.90]Cheats, cheats, cheats.

[330:44.77]Okay.
[330:57.15]I enabled cheats first.

[336:14.44]Did he always sound like this?
[336:18.48]30 years ago.
[336:39.14]Remember, the voice actress that does Bart is like 75 years old.
[336:45.26]She was like 30.
[336:48.52]She was doing Bart for the first time.
[336:59.69]I said she.
[337:14.62]Alright, this is the end of the stream.
[337:16.00]I'm done.
[337:18.86]I'm done.
[337:19.42]This is fun, though.
[337:21.52]Here's the real tutorial.
[337:22.74]Real, real, real.
[337:23.83]Please, last time, Larry.
[337:25.77]Last time, Larry.
[337:27.47]Last time I try to help you.
[337:28.63]Okay.
[337:31.09]Ooh, and it's a good one, too.
[337:32.91]I'll give you one second.
[337:35.29]Yep.
[337:36.81]That's the last time I click on a link from you, Larry.
[337:46.58]real tutorial okay this one is let's just watch this now I swear to god if a muse elk video plays but I I good grammar and spelling are important but if you want to write essays that inspire
[338:14.29]messages that forge brighter connections and emails that get the job alright let me tell you something about like grammarly right we are just teaching people that they can just mash their keyboards you don't have to know how to spell anything you don't even have to know when to do periods commas exclamation points never you know who cares
[338:38.73]Eventually, you're gonna start writing emotes, and Grammarly's gonna write your essay for you.
[338:42.85]It's gonna be like, jermaOld, jermaRatS, uh, monkaS, OMEGALUL, and it's gonna write a fucking story for you.
[338:58.02]Don't hit the- I don't- I'm not- What is that?
[339:27.37]I've played this game before.
[339:28.35]It's terrible.
[339:29.99]It's just not... It's so bad.
[339:33.14]What do you mean?
[339:33.92]That's not... You walk around and you attack.
[339:35.64]It's not good.
[339:38.88]Although I didn't play the remake.
[339:41.72]Oh.
[340:06.18]Hey guys, I deleted the browser source and I can't stop it.
[340:12.36]Isn't that interesting?
[340:15.42]It's off.
[340:16.02]It's not here anymore and I cannot control it.
[340:19.70]I deleted it from the source.
[340:22.74]I don't know why it's still playing.
[340:24.20]It's not even up here anymore.
[340:30.76]What do I do?
[340:34.81]Moving in!
[340:36.53]I'm going in!
[340:54.57]It's not on the screen.
[340:56.29]It's not even in my... Fuck you, Grammarly.
[340:58.29]It's the GTA radio.
[341:11.42]I know some of you guys think this is a joke or something.
[341:19.50]Oh, what a funny like bit he's doing.
[341:22.08]I've removed it from... It's not up here.
[341:25.40]There's no capture source.
[341:26.82]It's not here.
[341:27.70]This is gonna not... This is gonna happen until I hit the X on OBS.
[341:38.61]And if you need the support, Grammarly encourages you to write confidently.
[341:44.81]Because the better we all communicate, the better we connect.
[341:48.65]You have to prove it.
[341:50.20]Close the window.
[341:52.26]There is no window!
[341:53.74]I don't have a window.
[341:54.76]Wait, I think I found it.
[342:09.91]Hold on, I got it.
[342:15.61]I got it.
[342:29.58]What are you linking me?
[342:33.00]Yeah, you know how many times I've seen this image of me, Shibi, and Etalyx, and somebody writes something fucked up on my shirt?
[342:43.25]You either make me like five inches shorter, put like a big pee stain on my pants.
[342:47.75]That was really nice.
[342:51.41]Look at like the oily pee pee stain.
[342:53.53]I remember that one.
[342:54.24]That was funny.
[343:03.24]I'm done.
[343:04.20]I'll see you later.
[343:07.58]I'll see you later.
[343:08.22]That's it.
[343:10.54]I had a lot of fun, but I think it's time.
[343:25.35]Into the stream, boys?
[343:26.05]Yeah.
[343:27.18]No stream tomorrow, by the way.
[343:28.48]I have Doctor's stuff to do.
[343:31.88]I will not be around tomorrow.
[343:34.22]But I will be around Wednesday and Thursday.
[343:36.49]Wednesday and Thursday is probably going to be Desperados 3.
[343:38.87]I also want to do Custom Robo as well.
[343:47.22]Wednesday will be Desperados 3, and then if the game sucks, then game sucks, we'll do something else.
[343:53.40]Eternal Darkness I also have, but that'll probably be October.
[343:56.06]Are they going to finish Mercenaries?
[344:05.49]Probably not.
[344:07.83]Although this could be one of those... No, probably not.
[344:10.21]I think I've seen everything I wanted to see.
[344:12.63]Hmm.
[344:15.85]What time PST on Wednesday?
[344:17.23]Probably around the same time today.
[344:18.81]Like 10.
[344:20.03]This is fucking jump!
[344:26.07]Uh, it's probably the same time today.
[344:27.03]Around like 10 o'clock.
[344:27.73]10.30.
[344:28.33]I started at 11 today because of the PS3 problems.
[344:30.98]But somewhere around like 10.30.
[344:33.48]AM.
[344:33.76]Pacific.
[344:40.48]He's gonna run over by the boat.
[344:44.26]Wait.
[344:45.06]He's alive.
[344:48.22]I can't shoot through this glass?
[344:53.72]Holy shit!
[345:20.29]What?
[345:20.51]I can't end stream.
[345:21.49]I can't stop.
[345:24.29]I'm trying to stop.
[345:25.33]Alright, I gotta go.
[345:40.68]I'm gone.
[345:41.84]I'm officially gone.
[345:43.00]See you later.
[346:06.80]This character's invincible.
[346:26.74]I can't stop playing.
[346:27.84]Alright, I'm gonna hit the button.
[346:29.63]Am I sad?
[346:30.37]No, what?
[346:39.69]Am I sad?
[346:42.05]Why would I be sad?
[346:43.07]Alright, I'll see you guys Wednesday.
[346:53.52]Take care, everybody.
[346:54.48]Let's go.
[346:56.00]I gotta pull it.
[346:56.74]I gotta pull the plug.
[346:58.12]Pull the plug.
[346:59.90]Good.
[347:00.38]Done.
[347:00.99]Hey, look at that.
[347:01.89]Plug has been pulled.
[347:06.05]That was fun.
[347:06.57]I just couldn't stop.
[347:10.59]But there was Mercenaries 2.
[347:14.37]Not exactly what I wanted out of this game, and it is exactly what I thought it was going to be.
[347:21.37]I'll see you Wednesday.
[347:24.99]Thank you to all the community subs.
[347:26.31]By the way, speaking of, I want to make sure I make this really clear.
[347:29.65]There is no multi-month sub that you need for FTK.
[347:36.64]The server is apparently going to be able to handle over the course of I believe it's six or seven different servers connected together.
[347:43.66]Somewhere around a thousand people.
[347:48.18]Now the people that can actually play in like the main game is somewhere around like two or three hundred, maybe four hundred.
[347:56.03]But we made it differently this time.
[347:57.57]When I say we, I mean they.
[348:03.12]Where there's gonna be a lot of different, like, hub worlds connected for a queue system.
[348:07.78]So it's not just, like, the server gets fucking diarrhea'd on in 10 seconds, and there's 400 people, and then the whole thing crashes.
[348:17.99]Top subgifter st- no, this top subgifter hasn't worked since I implemented this in Streamlabs OBS.
[348:25.39]It's just there.
[348:26.45]It's just those guys.
[348:27.39]It's the slug every time.
[348:28.84]It's the rich money guy in the middle.
[348:30.14]And it's like the metamorphosizing alien squid on the right.
[348:34.72]It's always these people.
[348:36.36]Every time.
[348:36.70]What day are you going to do Custom Robo?
[348:41.78]Either Thursday or Monday.
[348:45.12]Depends on how long Desperados is if I have fun in it.
[348:50.08]Let's run the credits.
[348:52.27]Hopefully this works because I'm testing a theory here.
[348:57.09]The theory is, do I have to be on the Streamlabs page for it to work?
[349:04.07]Let's test it.
[349:07.63]Ready?
[349:19.51]Yep.
[349:20.97]Yep.
[349:22.98]The Streamlabs page has to be open and on my screen the whole time.
[349:29.75]That's new.
[349:30.59]I didn't need to do that before.
[349:34.53]I stopped streaming for two months and all these Windows update makes a bunch of shitty updates.
[349:38.35]I'm gonna be one person.
[349:44.05]Stop using Streamlabs.
[349:45.67]You know, I wish I could.
[349:49.23]But I've been so used to it for so long that I don't want to relearn another system.
[350:01.41]Hey, one guy.
[350:02.27]Nice job.
[350:04.01]Thanks for the subs, everybody.
[350:05.17]I'm sorry.
[350:06.73]My theory is correct.
[350:12.00]Actually, one guy.
[350:13.66]His channel is dying.
[350:14.90]Sad face.
[350:16.92]Dreaming's been rough lately.
[350:18.55]No, we're good.
[350:19.53]Everything's fine.
[350:21.37]That could be one person and it would be alright.
[350:23.27]Don't worry.
[350:23.73]Have you seen totally accurate battlegrounds?
[350:32.63]Uh, I have.
[350:37.41]I wanted to play it a long time ago, but it's early access, right?
[350:49.15]Why is he so sad?
[350:50.23]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[350:51.47]Stop.
[350:51.97]Stop it.
[350:54.11]You cut this out right now.
[350:57.03]You're all going to be in big trouble.
[350:58.74]A lot of players recently.
[351:01.46]Maybe I'd play it.
[351:05.12]Alright, guys.
[351:05.56]I'll see you Wednesday.
[351:06.26]Have a great rest of your night.
[351:10.93]Let's do a raid.
[351:11.55]Who have we not raided in a long time?
[351:16.06]I want to try to cycle people, like people that we haven't rated in a very long time.
[351:26.22]Who's online at the moment?
[351:27.53]Let's take a look.
[351:36.85]I'm seeing a bunch of names.
[351:43.47]You know, let's raid Criken.
[351:44.53]It's been a long time since we've raided Criken.
[351:49.60]Been a while since I've talked to Criken, too.
[351:50.92]It's been a few months.
[351:53.06]See how he's doing.
[351:53.92]What is he playing?
[351:55.14]Outward?
[351:56.96]Tell Criken I said hello.
[351:58.80]Enjoy yourselves.
[351:59.52]If you feel like sticking around on Criken's stream, then go for it.
[352:02.76]If not, then we'll see you Wednesday.
[352:05.80]Are you going to ever use channel points again?
[352:07.44]Yes.
[352:09.32]Eventually, there will be something else to do.
[352:11.02]I promise.
[352:12.93]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[352:13.87]See you Wednesday.
[352:14.45]Have a great rest of your next day or two.
[352:19.78]See you Wednesday for Desperados 3.
[352:22.66]Now get out of here.
[352:24.34]Scram.
[352:24.72]I think I spelled his name wrong.
[352:28.73]No, I didn't.
[352:29.09]Alright, take care guys.
[352:30.81]See you soon.
[352:54.66]you
