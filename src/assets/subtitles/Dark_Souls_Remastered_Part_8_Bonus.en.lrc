[00:01.78]Alright, if I was an Apple employee, I would definitely try to come up with a solution to the whole 2% battery issue.
[00:12.66]You know when you have like 3% battery, 2% battery, and there's something you need to do on your phone, but you just don't know if you have enough time.
[00:20.01]And you'll be mid-text or, I don't know, 2%?
[00:22.87]Should I make this phone call?
[00:24.71]And then, oh, it's dead.
[00:27.23]You can't do it.
[00:27.85]Sorry.
[00:28.41]Halfway through the thing you were doing.
[00:30.55]So, you know, get an engineer on the line here.
[00:34.87]I want a countdown, you know?
[00:37.01]Once you get down to like that 2%, 1%, give me that countdown.
[00:41.39]You can't do like a 30 second countdown for when the phone's gonna turn off.
[00:44.75]Why does it just have to turn off?
[00:46.23]That's some fucking soldering that can be done to make that happen, don't you think?
[00:54.96]Depends on what you're doing.
[00:56.08]Yeah, well, you could adjust the countdown.
[01:01.26]Guys, my phone doesn't have more than 10% battery ever.
[01:04.98]I plug my phone in to an outlet, and then I need to use it like less than five minutes later, and oh shit, I gotta get my phone.
[01:12.81]I unplug it and I use it.
[01:13.81]I don't think I've ever had a battery that never passed like 25%, at least in the last like six months.
[01:22.11]I don't, because I have an iPad, right?
[01:23.65]Hold on, let me close my windows.
[01:28.96]So here's the thing about why I don't have my devices ever charged.
[01:34.70]I have too many devices.
[01:36.32]So when I'm lying in bed, and oh, just charge your phone overnight.
[01:41.59]But then I can't play casino slot machine games on my iPad.
[01:44.99]Because I have to be plugged in because it drains a ton of battery.
[01:47.35]I can't watch Doctor Who on Netflix, right?
[01:51.51]I can't do that.
[01:52.57]I gotta have my iPad plugged in.
[02:00.83]Doctor Who.
[02:02.64]And by the way, I've never seen one episode of Doctor Who.
[02:04.84]No, I've seen one.
[02:07.00]Where he, like, traveled back in time to, like, stop himself from doing something.
[02:10.60]It was a pretty good episode.
[02:16.39]Hadn't there been, like, 17 seasons of Doctor Who and, like, 7 different people who played the Doctor?
[02:23.70]He traveled in time.
[02:25.24]That's the whole purpose of the show, apparently.
[02:27.91]Okay.
[02:29.27]Anyways, welcome to the final stream of Dark Souls.
[02:33.21]This is the last time I'm going to play this game on stream.
[02:35.25]This is it.
[02:37.60]We went a little long.
[02:38.94]It took me an extra hour or so, I think, probably to complete the base game and the DLC.
[02:47.57]So this is it.
[02:48.47]This is the final Dark Souls stream.
[02:50.18]I wanted to leave enough room for multiplayer and PvP, but I didn't because it was like six hours had gone by and it was like time for bed.
[02:54.93]It was like one o'clock in the morning.
[02:55.91]So here we are.
[02:57.42]Starting like an hour and a half or so early.
[03:00.28]Today, the only plan is just PvP.
[03:03.97]Do some multiplayer, make some new characters, stick around for a little bit.
[03:07.57]This is going to be kind of a chill, just... Not really much planned for this one.
[03:13.45]Besides a little bit of PvP.
[03:14.69]Open PvP, by the way.
[03:15.69]We're going to have a password on the game.
[03:17.97]And just... We'll just summon people in.
[03:21.45]I made a new character.
[03:22.33]I got a couple of new characters I want to try.
[03:28.17]And, um, let's, let's do it.
[03:30.05]What do you say?
[03:31.32]So here's the thing that I need to ask you guys very, very specifically.
[03:35.34]Here's my, here's my new character.
[03:41.72]So I, I want, I made this, this guy's name is Mac and Cheese.
[03:43.92]I don't know, I made him like a fist only character.
[03:48.97]Double cestus only.
[03:52.25]Oh, I gotta turn the, there's no audio.
[03:53.79]There it is.
[03:56.13]Yeah.
[03:56.74]So I want to try a character like this.
[03:59.76]Where you just punch.
[04:01.38]You get the parry too.
[04:02.26]It's really quick.
[04:04.78]Did I get the hammer to five?
[04:06.44]No, I have not.
[04:07.98]I spent the time off stream getting two or three characters to level like 20, 30.
[04:13.06]Just so I could have some options.
[04:17.72]People weren't kidding about the Kotaku.
[04:19.32]Okay, here's the thing.
[04:21.26]There's a Kotaku article about the stream two days ago.
[04:27.36]That was pretty surprising.
[04:28.36]I did not expect that.
[04:31.22]And it's funny, because the headline really is just like... Guy dies in Bed of Chaos!
[04:37.57]It's like, oh, alright, yeah, I did.
[04:40.41]I did die to The Bed of Chaos.
[04:44.83]That clip has like over 200,000 views.
[04:46.01]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[04:48.67]Well, that's cool, I guess.
[04:51.85]That's pretty cool.
[04:57.07]That's the most basic title.
[04:58.13]Yeah, well, go look at that title.
[04:59.77]It is.
[05:00.17]It's just like... Can you believe it?
[05:02.71]Guy dies at worst boss in Dark Souls?
[05:04.85]Alright, so... Here's a few things, right?
[05:10.46]So I need to be... Let's reverse.
[05:14.02]Let me put it home.
[05:14.60]Let me get a password on this game before any of you guys try to get in here.
[05:20.68]Okay, options, network settings...
[05:23.90]Region matchmaking I'm gonna we're gonna stay local for now.
[05:27.15]You know what fuck it.
[05:27.85]Let's go global who gives a shit It's gonna be a mess anyways matchmaking password What can I not do levels here Matchmaking password, I guess we'll just make it How about like all lowercase and
[05:52.38]Because we're on Twitch, let's make it dramatic.
[05:57.44]No, no, no, that's probably like 5,000 different passwords.
[06:00.22]No, it's going to be 777LUCKY7.
[06:03.18]That's it.
[06:04.60]777LUCKY, that's it.
[06:07.11]All locates, nothing else, just 777, no spaces, LUCKY.
[06:12.17]In fact, I can just show it on screen.
[06:13.67]What am I doing here?
[06:15.25]There it is.
[06:17.91]So it's global, so it's going to be laggy and horrible, but you know.
[06:22.38]Does it really matter?
[06:24.60]Launch setting.
[06:25.27]No, someone signed visibility.
[06:26.41]Restricted.
[06:26.77]What does that mean?
[06:28.51]What does this actually mean?
[06:33.59]Make it circus circus.
[06:38.89]Because in the other games, couldn't you set how far off soul level people could be?
[06:45.08]That's my actual Club Penguin password.
[06:49.28]Unrestricted.
[06:52.73]And then ranking registration.
[06:54.25]Add this character to rankings.
[06:55.67]No, we're not doing that.
[07:01.27]I'm not gonna... No, we're not playing Club Penguin.
[07:06.96]So I'm gonna get to an area.
[07:09.06]Okay, so let's just play some multiplayer fun time.
[07:12.32]You know what I mean?
[07:14.12]You don't have to be ranked.
[07:14.76]Alright, there we go.
[07:17.06]Let me turn.
[07:17.62]Let me get out of holo.
[07:22.64]How does the multiplayer work in the original Dark Souls?
[07:27.22]Can anybody even join this game?
[07:29.36]Depending on what I've done.
[07:32.68]Because if you take a look, I'm level 17 right now.
[07:36.48]I just killed the Taurus Demon and I've opened up the area next to go to the Bell.
[07:41.47]Gargoyles.
[07:42.79]Gargoyles.
[07:46.57]I'm going to go on that other character and we're going to go to the specific PvP area.
[07:56.82]Just for the sake of running around and just playing for a little bit.
[08:01.22]What just happened to me?
[08:08.77]You might as well just play in the actual character.
[08:12.97]People near your level and weapon upgrade range can connect.
[08:18.91]Oh, I also got this, right?
[08:20.47]Don't I need to eat the dried finger so a bunch of people can join in?
[08:26.09]I look like a rejected Simpsons character?
[08:28.79]No, I look like fucking mac and cheese.
[08:30.59]Like, that's the guy's name.
[08:31.39]Alright, um... So, let me go... Alright, just, like, kill everything for me so I can get to level 25.
[08:42.58]Let me go to the... I can go to New Londo and then... So, like, there's no signs here yet.
[08:51.11]I don't think I can even do it here.
[08:55.96]No warping.
[08:56.78]I mean, should I just start on the higher character first?
[09:03.11]Or should I, you know, summon a bunch of people?
[09:07.85]There's no signs allowed to fire the link?
[09:09.31]Okay.
[09:12.51]Yeah, let's start.
[09:13.55]Let's actually go do, like, PvP in the PvP zone first.
[09:16.96]We'll dick around later.
[09:19.68]We'll do this later.
[09:21.20]That's probably not a bad idea.
[09:25.34]Let me actually go to the DLC PvP area.
[09:34.62]Okay, I need to log in, first of all.
[09:38.29]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:38.97]Alright.
[09:39.85]Load game.
[09:40.33]Here are my characters.
[09:41.81]I've got, uh...
[09:44.53]This is High High.
[09:46.74]This guy's level 30.
[09:47.82]This guy is a lightning faith man.
[09:50.48]So I wanted to make sure to try him.
[09:52.92]Mac and Cheese, you all of course already know.
[09:54.60]Silver Penny, you already know who that is.
[09:56.66]And then Triple Zero, who is sorcery.
[10:00.74]So, just trying out some stuff.
[10:03.22]That doesn't matter.
[10:03.86]We can do whatever we want.
[10:04.78]But time to go.
[10:05.50]I'm 95.
[10:05.62]Soul level 95.
[10:12.56]Alright, 95.
[10:13.46]Now let's go to... Where is... Where is... Why can I not warp?
[10:25.70]Oh, fuck me, man.
[10:27.10]It's like the... I'm in New Game Plus.
[10:34.54]Can I run there?
[10:40.78]Alright, no, I'm going this way.
[10:47.26]What about straight ahead here, right?
[10:49.23]That's like a decent place to start.
[10:50.83]Did I kill the dragon alive?
[10:52.07]Is the dragon alive?
[10:57.47]I think I killed the dragon.
[10:58.39]No, did I kill the dragon?
[11:02.82]Did we kill the dragon in this game?
[11:11.09]People generally play PvP in the undead bur- So what about like right here?
[11:24.55]Do people like PvP like over here?
[11:28.55]That's a pretty good PvP spot, don't you think?
[11:33.21]You don't think that's a good PvP spot?
[11:40.70]No?
[11:41.10]A bunch of you guys can sit here and watch as an audience over the arena, right?
[11:51.73]You gotta get the gargoyles.
[11:52.97]I just have to play through half the game again.
[11:57.73]It doesn't matter.
[11:58.15]We're gonna start here, okay?
[12:00.39]We're at the point right now where I wanna fight somebody.
[12:03.55]Let's take a humanity.
[12:07.45]And then I need to kindle.
[12:08.65]Oh, fuck me.
[12:11.28]Okay, I got a reverse holo.
[12:12.42]Oh, what a pain in the ass.
[12:15.15]All of this got so fucked up because I went to New Game Plus.
[12:19.51]I forgot that Dark Souls multiplayer is... What the fuck is going on here?
[12:28.11]Just get me over here.
[12:28.85]I'm just going to go to the bonfire down here.
[12:31.75]Alright, this has been kicked.
[12:40.54]Alright.
[12:50.83]Alright, here we go.
[12:52.49]This is a good PvP zone right here.
[12:59.19]It's like right here.
[13:00.48]You guys think this is a good spot to PvP?
[13:02.10]Let me make sure I have the password on.
[13:09.44]Yeah, it's on.
[13:14.91]The square area right below here.
[13:17.77]Like down there.
[13:18.45]Alright, that sounds good to me.
[13:21.18]I gotta get ready though, I need to make sure I have the right character that I want to PvP with.
[13:30.31]Alright, so, this is the area we're gonna fight.
[13:40.72]This is the spot, huh?
[13:43.22]Alright, well, where are those signs?
[13:51.93]I can't believe I'm fucking in a new game plus.
[13:56.26]You can't PvP here if you killed the Taurus Demon.
[13:59.10]God fucking damn it.
[14:05.22]Well, move on to the next one.
[14:11.27]So who's alive?
[14:12.39]I don't think I killed the Gargoyles.
[14:14.03]No, did I?
[14:14.71]No, I didn't.
[14:16.63]So we're gonna go to like... Where the fuck are we gonna go?
[14:28.25]Oh, that has to be through red sign.
[14:30.00]Okay.
[14:32.96]Well... We have to use the red soapstone.
[14:37.35]People can't just like... Alright, let's go.
[14:39.13]I'm going to fight... Wait, wait, wait.
[14:41.11]Wait a second.
[14:41.65]Hold on.
[14:47.30]I got to be ready for this.
[14:57.30]I gotta put on different clothes for this.
[14:58.54]Hold on.
[15:05.08]Alright.
[15:05.80]We're just gonna start with this first.
[15:07.51]I just want to be able to move around.
[15:08.47]I don't really care about armor.
[15:09.45]Let's just go.
[15:11.29]Summon the sign.
[15:12.37]Duelist of Duper is the first person.
[15:18.40]No, I'm not gonna do full Havel.
[15:21.54]Wait, I gotta be level... I gotta be full healed.
[15:26.87]No fast roll?
[15:27.63]Yes, it is.
[15:28.03]Alright, where is this guy?
[15:36.61]There he is.
[15:36.97]Alright, what has he got?
[15:37.75]Looks like a pretty standard build.
[15:40.13]He's got a shield.
[15:42.19]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[15:45.31]Alright, so am I going to do that too?
[15:48.97]So this is how... No BM, right?
[15:51.55]No drinking?
[15:52.65]No smoking?
[15:53.21]Alright, let's do it.
[16:09.06]Think I got it.
[16:09.70]Nope.
[16:10.64]He's dead.
[16:13.00]Thank you for joining.
[16:14.64]That was fun.
[16:17.50]Do I get any stuff?
[16:18.38]Retrieve power.
[16:21.22]Oh my god, that's so many souls.
[16:23.50]That's too many souls.
[16:27.55]What else we got here?
[16:28.23]We got, uh, Faye Toro.
[16:31.99]Giant dad.
[16:32.97]Oh, look.
[16:34.13]You wanna fight the meme?
[16:34.95]Let's fight the meme boss.
[16:39.77]I'm ready to fight the meme boss.
[16:41.51]Let's see what happens.
[16:50.01]Alright, let's do it.
[16:55.53]So that's what it looks like?
[16:57.07]That's what Giant Dad looks like.
[16:58.48]Alright.
[17:00.70]Well, I gotta say hello to him too.
[17:02.84]I gotta change a... No.
[17:06.06]Well, don't say sorry yet.
[17:08.90]Don't say sorry yet, man.
[17:10.20]I know this is like the thing that's like the 99-99, right?
[17:18.79]Okay.
[17:20.79]Well, I was gonna parry.
[17:23.09]I didn't even... Apparently I did.
[17:29.34]Why could I not parry?
[17:33.38]What was up with that shit?
[17:40.83]That's what you get for messing with the meme.
[17:46.64]What's the password?
[17:48.26]777lucky.
[17:52.24]Yeah, we're gonna do more than this.
[17:53.24]This is just to start, but it's gonna mess around PvP for a little while.
[17:58.30]And then, I would really wish I could play on the other character, but I did a thing called, I completed the game.
[18:07.79]And plus, by the way, there's no rhyme or reason to this.
[18:09.65]It's just if you have a cool name, you're gonna get summoned.
[18:12.43]That's pretty much how this is gonna work.
[18:15.35]Do you have a cool name?
[18:16.37]Alright, let's see how cool this guy's name is.
[18:32.88]Alright, James, that's a pretty cool name.
[18:35.09]That's a good name.
[18:36.21]Wait, didn't I just fight this guy?
[18:43.70]That's the coolest name so far.
[18:47.08]I kind of want to change a little bit here.
[18:51.34]I want to get rid of the... Okay, that's fine.
[18:57.38]Alright, James.
[18:58.18]What do you say?
[19:00.64]You versus me.
[19:03.30]Warthog versus whoever you can be.
[19:05.77]Alright, let's go.
[19:22.70]Whoa, that's a move!
[19:43.22]Whoa, what's that?
[19:44.12]That's a fireball.
[19:49.49]Oh god!
[19:50.43]I got it!
[19:52.03]I'm so lucky I didn't... One!
[20:01.37]Two!
[20:02.25]Three!
[20:02.83]Got him!
[20:11.25]Alright.
[20:11.95]Thank you for playing, James.
[20:14.95]No, you're giant dad.
[20:16.01]You already got to humiliate me on camera.
[20:19.49]Alright, we're gonna go from James to John.
[20:23.32]So, James to John.
[20:33.22]Any other first names?
[20:35.86]The best part about this is when people name their Dark Souls characters, I don't know how new the character is, but you do, like, one of my Dark Souls characters' names is just High.
[20:46.51]Like, oh, High, I don't care.
[20:47.73]Triple Zero, like, I didn't care.
[20:48.99]Alright, let's do it.
[20:58.18]Oh, shit.
[20:58.36]Oh, shit.
[21:12.68]I got him.
[21:13.80]Just a taste.
[21:22.47]Mmm, had the same idea.
[21:26.27]Oh, he's getting... Yeah, we're getting too close!
[21:36.04]Oh, he got me!
[21:36.74]I was gonna try to parry it.
[21:40.06]It's too slow.
[21:48.65]Nice work, man.
[21:52.09]Alright, we're gonna do something else now.
[21:57.14]Let's go with... What do I got?
[22:03.80]31?
[22:03.82]Alright.
[22:07.02]I am naked, but you can't be naked.
[22:08.64]You have to have something on your head.
[22:12.35]No, that's too light.
[22:17.38]I don't know, like, be like fucking Robin Hood.
[22:24.25]Robin Hood with baggy pants.
[22:26.29]Does that work?
[22:28.93]Oh, this is just like an undead blue TF2 sniper.
[22:33.63]Uh, 30... No, I can do something like this.
[22:36.80]What about like a towel?
[22:43.28]How is that heavier?
[22:45.06]No, it's not.
[22:45.52]Okay, good.
[22:53.84]Am I gonna die from the fucking random shitty enemies that are right here?
[22:56.96]I didn't even fucking Kindle.
[22:59.30]Not Kindle.
[22:59.76]You know the thing.
[23:00.30]The thing.
[23:00.68]Alright, I'm dead.
[23:02.26]That's great.
[23:07.09]Reverse hollowing.
[23:10.17]And before I'm gonna lose the 50,000 souls.
[23:12.01]I'm not gonna lose them.
[23:12.87]Don't worry.
[23:22.59]I do want to do a thing where, like, eventually... You can get, like, six people in the same game.
[23:28.26]I want to do that.
[23:29.02]That sounds like fun.
[23:29.80]After we PvP for, like, an hour.
[23:30.94]Alright, let's do it.
[23:32.58]Let's head out there.
[23:40.79]Yeah, I don't want these guys shooting shit at us.
[23:45.75]No shield.
[23:46.53]No parries here.
[23:50.97]Get out of my fucking way.
[23:52.99]Hey, in New Game Plus, why can't I just, like, delete enemies?
[23:55.57]That should be a thing.
[23:56.23]Didn't hit you?
[23:59.27]How?
[24:00.77]Alright.
[24:01.63]So, let's take a look again.
[24:02.59]There's John again.
[24:10.16]Is that a different John?
[24:13.64]Alright, while we... Okay, this guy... Let's fight the guy in the diaper that has, like, the funny little hat on.
[24:18.26]That sounds fun.
[24:20.70]This guy has the meme name and he also has the underwear on, so... Alright, let's see what he does.
[24:36.58]Let's take a look.
[24:37.28]Is he probably like a caster or something?
[24:40.20]Or is he unarmed?
[24:44.06]What is he... What are you doing?
[24:48.36]Why are you leaving me a breadcrumb trail?
[24:57.52]I don't think I want to pick those up.
[24:58.84]I feel like those are bags.
[24:59.82]Those could be filled with shit.
[25:01.32]I have no idea.
[25:04.64]I'm not picking those up.
[25:07.96]You can treasure goblin me all you want.
[25:09.68]I'm not going to touch them.
[25:11.69]They could be filled with explosives.
[25:13.23]I don't know what they are.
[25:16.49]What is that?
[25:16.85]What is he doing?
[25:18.15]Stop hacking in my game.
[25:21.02]I gotta kill him.
[25:21.54]I have to kill him.
[25:21.96]He has to die.
[25:23.63]He has to die.
[25:24.49]Otherwise, like, FromSoftware's gonna think that I, like, made those poop bags, right?
[25:31.77]No, don't kill him?
[25:32.49]What happens if he dies?
[25:33.37]Should I not kill him?
[25:36.37]No, I'm not gonna do it.
[25:37.05]Somebody else can.
[25:38.21]Alright, come on, John.
[25:38.81]Get in here.
[25:40.29]John, you have to do it.
[25:41.11]I have nothing to do with this.
[25:43.41]My hands are clean.
[25:49.35]Like, I never even touched him, right?
[25:50.77]Like, they don't have any data or logs of me R1-ing or R2-ing against this guy.
[25:55.77]He'll take care of it.
[25:59.93]Get him, John!
[26:02.42]John, get him!
[26:04.28]John!
[26:08.12]John, kill him!
[26:09.82]Get rid of him!
[26:10.80]He touched me!
[26:11.60]He already touched me!
[26:13.08]He's corrupting me!
[26:19.72]Get him, John!
[26:26.91]Get the fuck away from me.
[26:28.19]Get away from me!
[26:28.99]Stop!
[26:32.07]Look, I didn't do anything.
[26:33.54]I'm passive.
[26:34.16]Alright, he's stuck.
[26:36.30]He's literally stuck here.
[26:37.22]He can't move.
[26:40.16]Alright, he's dead.
[26:40.68]Remember, I didn't kill him.
[26:43.54]I didn't touch him.
[26:48.50]Okay, I got points for that.
[26:51.34]But I shouldn't have.
[26:53.40]Thank you, John.
[26:54.88]That was fun.
[26:55.40]Now let's go up here and have a fight.
[26:59.03]John, don't touch those items.
[27:01.13]They're essentially landmines.
[27:02.91]Don't even touch them.
[27:05.89]Alright.
[27:06.35]Ready, John?
[27:07.75]I'm ready.
[27:11.21]I would bow, but it was too late.
[27:26.20]It's gonna claw, it's gonna claw!
[27:43.72]You think you can beat John?
[27:47.50]I get distracted by the guy throwing fucking shitbags on the ground.
[27:55.02]Should have parried.
[27:56.78]You can parry with your hand, but I can't one hand this, can I?
[28:03.24]Let's go back here.
[28:04.36]Alright, so what are the names that I need to avoid, right?
[28:10.80]What are they?
[28:12.44]There's like that list of meme hacker names that I need to watch out for, right?
[28:16.58]What are they?
[28:18.98]Waluigi.
[28:24.99]Anything with a... Anything with a meme in the name.
[28:31.43]Back up my save file?
[28:33.91]Well, here's the one... The one silver lining to this is, let's say Hacker comes in here and deletes everything, right?
[28:39.51]I mean... I already beat the whole... The whole DLC, I beat the whole game, like... We're finished with the game.
[28:47.00]I mean, it would suck, but... What am I gonna do?
[28:52.09]Let's take a look.
[28:52.51]Who's got a cool name?
[28:53.37]Doinkus.
[28:53.95]Alright, I like that.
[28:55.57]Doinkus is not a bad name.
[29:02.29]That one's not bad.
[29:03.03]We already fought Hugh.
[29:07.35]He's cool looking.
[29:09.49]John is John.
[29:10.33]Okay, sad faces.
[29:14.75]That sad face is pretty good.
[29:16.53]I like it.
[29:23.01]After that, I think I want to go after Doinkus.
[29:24.79]Doinkus is a pretty cool name.
[29:29.17]This guy's going to be fast.
[29:39.78]Wait, are those hacked items too?
[29:43.28]Should I not pick those up?
[29:46.14]No, he's making like a joke.
[29:47.74]Okay, that's just a funny joke.
[29:50.77]You're going six feet under.
[29:53.81]Well, that was not nice.
[29:55.09]That was very mean.
[29:55.79]I don't know.
[29:57.77]What did that even do?
[29:58.41]Is it poison?
[29:59.01]Alright, hold on.
[30:02.73]Let me cleanse that.
[30:06.63]Stop doing that.
[30:07.81]Why would you do that?
[30:11.21]Alright, it's on.
[30:12.15]Whatever.
[30:13.39]I'm going to kill you in one hit anyways.
[30:14.53]I'm going to kill you in one hit!
[30:21.69]What about this?!
[30:31.66]I can't fucking- Why do I feel like my- wha- okay.
[30:40.65]That was- that was not fair.
[30:41.93]The toxic thing was not fair.
[30:43.59]By the way, this item is terrible in PvP.
[30:47.05]Get this fucking thing out of here.
[30:48.10]This thing sucks.
[30:57.08]Where is it?
[30:57.90]Like, that item is so bad.
[31:10.99]Blaming the weapon?
[31:11.87]Well, I mean, it takes like three seconds to swing.
[31:14.65]All somebody has to do is run behind me and kill me.
[31:16.51]I want to stay with this outfit.
[31:22.55]I like this outfit.
[31:23.89]This has to go.
[31:27.07]Let's just put that on.
[31:38.22]What am I doing?
[31:38.80]You know what?
[31:40.56]I can't wait to delete every single weapon I have.
[31:42.82]And every single item I have.
[31:44.10]Every single item is getting deleted.
[31:46.43]And just like humanity is going to be left.
[31:55.56]Do it now!
[31:56.08]Is it going to be useless in 99% of these situations?
[32:02.23]Oh, it doesn't matter.
[32:10.99]I can actually put on... Let me put different stuff on, though.
[32:21.88]Okay.
[32:24.12]Let's go with...
[32:28.49]Let's be a silver knight.
[32:31.08]With a butcher's knife.
[32:34.26]Right?
[32:35.36]And a dress on.
[32:39.06]No, I don't like the fact that that's happening.
[32:45.19]This thing is useless.
[32:45.97]Take it off.
[32:48.61]Let's put the havel ring back on.
[32:50.31]I think I can do it now.
[32:53.90]We're going to be the silver wedding gown.
[32:56.14]That sounds good.
[32:57.24]Alright, let's go.
[33:00.22]Where's Doinkus?
[33:00.78]There's the sad face again.
[33:08.50]It's Brittany.
[33:10.24]Dino Dan.
[33:11.58]I want to find... There's Doinkus, right?
[33:13.40]I mean, this guy's cool looking, though.
[33:20.34]By the way, where the fuck is my shield that I had on?
[33:29.53]I can't use this?
[33:30.45]Let's just skip the... Keep the one I had on.
[33:37.21]Hey!
[33:38.49]Hello, mung... Hello, mundungus.
[33:45.80]You're freaking me out here.
[33:46.86]I don't like this.
[33:48.88]Alright, I'm ready.
[33:57.50]Let's do it.
[33:58.24]What is that move?
[33:59.22]I don't know.
[34:03.86]I don't know what that is.
[34:09.30]Why is he doing that?
[34:10.56]What the fuck is he doing?
[34:17.53]Alright, I got him.
[34:22.50]Alright, good game.
[34:26.46]Wrong spell?
[34:27.38]That wasn't the wrong spell.
[34:36.24]It's James.
[34:39.64]Dino Dan.
[34:40.30]Let's get Dino Dan in here.
[34:47.88]Well, we're going to be able to level up a hundred times.
[34:56.74]I thought that guy was a treasure chest at first.
[34:58.60]Alright, this is a caster.
[35:00.42]So, I gotta be ready for this.
[35:01.34]Alright, I won't... Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[35:12.02]I have an idea.
[35:12.76]Oh, wait, no, no, no.
[35:13.30]Do that again.
[35:14.69]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[35:15.39]No, no, no.
[35:15.79]Don't throw poison at me.
[35:16.77]Stop it.
[35:17.27]Go in the canister and go hide somewhere and I have to find you.
[35:24.93]No, we didn't start yet, so I'm gonna heal.
[35:27.29]We did not start the game yet.
[35:28.46]Okay, hold on.
[35:30.64]I have to... Let's... Okay, I'm ready.
[35:37.16]Let's... No, it's too late now.
[35:42.73]I wanted to, like, have you go hide in a room somewhere.
[35:44.59]Okay, go in here.
[36:03.16]There's stream lag?
[36:03.92]What do you mean stream lag?
[36:05.70]We should be at three seconds.
[36:06.78]I have the beta on where it's like two or three seconds.
[36:18.29]Alright, let's go.
[36:18.89]I'm ready.
[36:23.93]Ooh.
[36:30.11]That's a move.
[36:34.99]He's switching weapons on me, is he?
[36:36.47]Whoa!
[36:55.20]What the fuck?
[37:00.06]He just did my entire health bar.
[37:02.70]What was that?
[37:11.93]That was wild.
[37:21.26]That was his Patronus.
[37:27.03]Password 777Lucky.
[37:30.47]That is the password.
[37:33.21]Stop crushing humanity?
[37:35.77]Well, how... Don't I have to be a human to see signs on the ground?
[37:39.10]I thought that's how it worked.
[37:46.26]I don't have to do that.
[37:55.94]Each guy you kill drops humanity?
[37:57.52]Oh, okay.
[37:58.87]I see.
[37:59.15]Alright, let's do it.

[47:55.11]Don't you dare!
[48:01.39]What?

[49:12.87]And, like, all of us fight the Bell Gargoyles.
[49:18.19]What happened to all the signs?
[49:19.55]Oh.
[49:21.01]No, we're not.
[49:21.65]You know what?
[49:21.97]I want my revenge.
[49:23.07]No, I don't.
[49:23.57]I'm gonna lose instantly.

[50:04.25]Alright, he's going.
[50:04.93]These things are going to fight me.
[50:05.81]These things are going to shoot at me.
[50:06.59]I know they do.
[50:07.79]I've seen this before.
[50:09.46]When he walks over here, they're going to shoot at me.

[50:14.74]See?
[50:14.86]Look what he's doing.
[50:15.44]Look what he's doing.
[50:15.90]He's trying to not look at me and kill me.
[50:18.80]When do they shoot?
[50:19.60]There they are.
[50:26.22]What the fuck is all this stuff?
[50:28.13]All I have is a butcher's knife.
[50:38.25]God I didn't even hurt him.
[50:40.03]Oh my fucking god What the fuck man look at all the stuff he's doing this guy has like 50 moves Fucking dead Jesus Christ
[51:12.22]I saw six or seven different moves.
[51:17.87]Look at this shit character.
[51:19.21]I leveled up to Butcher Knife.
[51:22.04]I'm ready to PvP.
[51:23.30]Please fight me.
[51:39.88]Is hot dog a sandwich?
[51:40.95]No!

[52:21.45]I'm gonna be one of these, like, shitties out here.
[52:27.17]Praise the sun.
[52:29.55]Look, I'm gonna praise the sun!
[52:30.65]This is like a Halloween costume that somebody would wear.
[52:49.15]Alright, it's time.
[52:50.53]This is the last one.
[52:52.11]Last one.
[52:52.63]And it's going to be Mike.
[53:04.23]I killed Solaire?
[53:05.87]No, I didn't.
[53:16.04]Alright, so he's got, is it the moonlit sword?
[53:19.12]And something else, more like some magic spells.
[53:22.78]I need to get some of those.
[53:23.82]I can't even fucking see, it's blocking my path.
[53:26.02]Fucking stupid smog's hammer.
[53:34.81]No, Jesus fucking Christ, man.
[53:44.11]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:57.34]I got him!
[53:57.76]Alright, now let me level up like 10 times.
[54:12.11]Alright, here's the, alright, now let's, hold on, go back.
[54:22.32]Thank you for playing on the Undead Burg.
[54:25.54]Jeremy sucks at PvP and gets embarrassed over and over again on stream.
[54:30.54]Thank you for playing!
[54:32.69]Now, we're gonna do something else.
[54:35.69]Here's what we're gonna do.
[54:37.59]I need to get the finger, which is down here.
[54:42.09]And... After... Hold on, just wait a minute.
[54:46.17]I wanna, like, summon a ton of people.
[54:51.12]I think he's down here?
[54:52.60]There's like a merchant down here, right?
[54:55.28]If I remember.
[54:55.84]I don't remember exactly where he is, but he's like around here somewhere.
[55:03.41]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[55:06.12]I'm dead.
[55:19.74]Jesus fucking Christ, man.
[55:21.88]Seriously.
[55:22.94]Oh, my God.
[55:23.56]This fucking hammer is going to drive me insane.
[55:36.79]Okay.
[55:43.63]Down here.
[55:44.19]I didn't pick this up.
[55:51.19]That's the humanity.
[55:53.27]Though it's not down here.
[55:57.67]I have to get this off my screen.
[56:03.80]Isn't it like down there?
[56:04.70]No.
[56:12.12]Under the Spear Knights.
[56:28.30]Back to where I was summoning across the bridge.
[56:32.72]Hold on, there's an item here I need to pick up.
[56:34.04]It's under the p- okay.
[56:39.65]It's under the place where we PvP'd.
[56:42.63]Alright.
[56:51.09]Wouldn't that be down there?
[56:58.38]Is there a way to get here from here?
[56:59.98]Honestly, remember, we're talking about an area that I haven't seen in about 40 hours of gameplay.
[57:08.99]That merchant, I saw him 39 hours ago.
[57:11.85]And that was it.
[57:12.43]I never went back.
[57:19.19]Not over here.
[57:20.47]There it is.
[57:25.53]No, I don't have Alzheimer's.
[57:28.15]You know what?
[57:28.55]I could just start screaming right now.
[57:30.19]Alright, let's put it on the bar.
[57:55.30]Before I get killed by this guy.
[57:56.48]Alright.
[58:05.64]Alright.
[58:07.33]What do you say... Let's use the finger... And just... Fuck around with it.
[58:16.69]Now I'm not sure... Can people... I don't think people can even...
[58:22.77]I'm just going to bring in as many people as I can.
[58:24.43]How many people can I summon right now?
[58:31.92]No, I'm not bringing in Giant Dad.
[58:33.32]Giant Dad's going to ruin the whole thing.
[58:41.26]Wait, no.
[58:41.62]That was a different name.
[58:43.77]Oh, fuck me.
[58:44.59]I saw Unstoppable and I clicked it.
[58:56.72]No, you gotta get somebody that hasn't been in here.
[58:59.01]Like, this person has, like, a swear word for a name, so I can't bring them in.
[59:06.23]I'm bringing in, like, all the fucking worst people.
[59:08.69]Don't fight, don't fight, don't fight.
[59:11.57]Stay, be good boys and girls.
[59:17.69]I like this guy's got the funny thing on his head.
[59:24.66]This guy's gonna come and just ruin everything, isn't he?
[59:27.55]How many people can I summon?
[59:33.96]Get away from me.
[59:34.56]Don't touch me.
[59:35.16]I don't like this guy.
[59:36.82]This guy's already causing me anxiety.
[59:46.22]Alright, that's it, right?
[59:47.14]Alright, so here's the plan.
[59:48.88]Once the other guy comes in, there's very specific rules here that you need to follow.
[59:53.93]You guys stay down there.
[59:58.81]Hey, hey, hey, slow down, slow down, hold on.
[60:01.77]I'm going to be a hazard for you guys.
[60:11.91]Alright, so.
[60:14.39]It's just going to be a bloodbath.
[60:15.43]It's going to be a royal rumble.
[60:16.93]I would say you should probably kill Giant Dad first.
[60:20.59]But, you know, I've been wrong before.
[60:23.89]So, um, on the count of three, you guys are gonna go at it.
[60:27.57]I would say, please, wait, where'd he go?
[60:29.42]Where'd you go?
[60:29.80]Wait, wait, wait, excuse me, where'd you go?
[60:31.46]What are you doing in there?
[60:33.36]What are you doing in here?
[60:33.98]Get out of there.
[60:35.24]Get out of there.
[60:35.80]You're scheming in there.
[60:37.56]Get out of there.
[60:40.52]I don't trust you as far as I can fucking throw you, man.
[60:44.27]Alright, so, on the count of three, go.
[60:49.27]Three, two, one, fight.
[60:51.21]Let's see.
[60:52.07]I would kill Giant Dad first.
[60:55.14]If I were you guys... Where's he going?
[60:56.22]He's just running away.
[60:57.64]Where are you fucking going?
[60:58.62]No.
[60:59.12]Don't just... Oh, Giant Dad going with the double swing there.
[61:05.26]The infinite swing.
[61:08.08]Crab Head is gone.
[61:10.64]Fireside is currently running around in circles.
[61:12.90]That was pretty cool.
[61:13.63]He's got the dragon sword.
[61:16.27]He's got the tinfoil sword, which is pretty good in this scenario.
[61:20.38]Fireside is currently... You know what?
[61:24.58]Somebody go kill that fucking guy down there.
[61:26.36]He's hiding.
[61:29.40]That was pretty nice.
[61:33.26]They're not close enough.
[61:33.98]I'm trying to throw a knife.
[61:38.83]Oh no!
[61:40.97]Did he actually just do that?
[61:42.43]I can't see from this far away.
[61:43.71]I need a better view.
[61:49.38]I can't believe it.
[61:51.22]They're all still alive.
[61:58.92]Even the guests are like, look, we're bringing in doinks, too.
[62:00.68]They don't even fucking know.
[62:01.72]Bringing in the equalizer.
[62:03.10]Where did he go?
[62:04.80]Where did he go?
[62:05.50]Seriously.
[62:09.98]Ah, there he goes.
[62:10.50]Giant Dad killed another one.
[62:13.20]Giant Dad might be going for another...
[62:15.95]Three kills on Giant Dad.
[62:17.35]I don't know where the fucking magician guy went, but it's freaking me out.
[62:24.89]Well, two big heavy characters here.
[62:30.66]What was that?
[62:31.10]Alright, get down there.
[62:39.63]Get in there.
[62:40.07]You get back in there.
[62:40.79]You get back in there.
[62:41.79]Get in there.
[62:44.35]Well, I think he just... Did he instantly die?
[62:46.41]We just missed Giant Dad dying!
[62:48.81]That guy's doing a thousand damage a swing.
[62:55.50]This guy was... Why is this guy doing so much damage?
[63:01.52]What does this guy have for a weapon?
[63:14.10]Everyone's putting their signs down here.
[63:19.08]Holy shit, man.
[63:19.82]This guy is something else.
[63:24.46]Look, see, that's the guy that killed me.
[63:27.10]He's, like, S-tier.
[63:28.00]And then you got fucking naked magician coming over here.
[63:30.40]Who's gonna win this one, I bet?
[63:34.37]I want a good view of this.
[63:40.11]Actually, you know, weirdly, my money is on nude magician.
[63:46.37]And I would be wrong.
[63:47.89]No, Doinkus is your winner.
[63:49.19]You came in and killed everybody.
[63:54.87]Give me those souls!
[64:06.56]I can do that too, you know.
[64:15.59]I have powers too, I can fucking summon people.
[64:20.55]Hup!
[64:22.77]How is that on a parry?
[64:24.05]What happened there?
[64:28.30]Hey!
[64:28.80]Alright.
[64:29.46]Like, I don't know what kind of video game I'm playing right now.
[64:39.77]Get him!
[64:40.13]Backstab him!
[64:40.89]Back- No, don't hit me!
[64:42.21]Backstab him!
[64:48.53]How did you do that?
[64:51.72]That doesn't make any sense!
[64:53.96]That's impossible!
[64:58.74]No shit!
[65:12.49]What?!
[65:16.31]This is the most confusing thing I've ever done.
[65:20.73]My backstab turned into me getting backstabbed.
[65:31.64]Alright, deal with this then.
[65:34.58]Why don't you deal with that guy?
[65:37.58]I just pressed the nuclear option, guys.
[65:40.18]Come on in.
[65:46.11]We're going nuclear.
[65:50.88]Get him.
[65:54.79]Come on, Giant Dad.
[65:56.11]Show us why you're impossible to beat.
[66:02.51]No.
[66:03.35]No!
[66:04.02]He's even going to beat the meme character.
[66:05.70]That's not even possible.
[66:09.12]Come on, meme!
[66:10.76]He got it.
[66:12.60]You did it.
[66:13.10]Congratulations, Giant Dad.
[66:21.57]Showing your ultimate status as a Dark Souls character.
[66:24.03]Am I gonna hurt him?
[66:36.04]Come on, hit me.
[66:38.78]Swing.
[66:39.32]Do it.
[66:40.02]I know you want to.
[66:42.10]Swing at me.
[66:43.04]Let me be the real killer of the meme.
[66:45.20]Hold on, I gotta get the remaining power here.
[66:48.16]You can't parry a fucking poison dart.
[66:56.63]Did I beat him?
[66:57.53]No I didn't, oh shit I didn't.
[66:59.71]How is he still, what?
[67:00.85]Why does he have that much health?
[67:21.56]The poison strat.
[67:29.46]Alright.
[67:30.48]Now it's time.
[67:31.61]Let's get out of this.
[67:34.59]I'm going to go on my little shit character.
[67:40.15]The last thing that I did was... Let me think about this here.
[67:51.98]300... 400,000 souls gone.
[67:56.15]It doesn't matter.
[67:56.63]I'm not gonna... It's over.
[67:57.43]It doesn't matter.
[67:57.91]I'm not gonna play through New Game Plus on that guy.
[67:59.65]It doesn't matter.
[68:00.11]We don't need him.
[68:03.57]Our bank account is already full.
[68:06.71]Okay, so I kind of want to just stick around with PvE and try to get to a certain area together.
[68:15.54]So do I play with my lightning character, my boxer, or my sorcerer?
[68:23.41]I think I want to play with Mac and Cheese.
[68:26.84]Sorcery?
[68:31.18]Boxer?
[68:33.62]Well, Lightning is level 30.
[68:35.38]So... I think I want to do Lightning.
[68:39.66]But now I made... I want to be Boxer.
[68:41.56]We're doing Boxer.
[68:42.24]Mac and Cheese.
[68:44.79]So I have to go to the... I have the Dried Finger.
[68:50.39]Whatever the hell it is.
[68:56.80]Where is it?
[68:57.06]I'm just going to put it on my inventory.
[69:00.94]So I'm just going to... Can I not use it here?
[69:02.46]Okay, let's just go.
[69:04.70]Why am I yellow?
[69:05.32]Because it's Mac and Cheese.
[69:06.58]That's the name of the character.
[69:08.78]So I've got to go to the Bell Gargoyles.
[69:10.52]I'm just going to... I'm actually just going to walk around and summon people.
[69:16.34]This is remastered?
[69:17.10]Yes, it is.
[69:17.84]Password is 777LUCKY.
[69:22.26]Well, that's interesting.
[69:26.06]We need to beat the battle gargoyles together.
[69:27.56]Yeah, this is on PC.
[69:36.16]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[69:36.97]I'm gonna die.
[69:38.47]I forgot this is new character here.
[69:42.05]This is like new character.
[69:47.77]You can't just walk around like a dickhead.
[69:55.97]No, actually, I have the bonfire.
[69:57.95]I have it already.
[69:58.65]Let's just go there.
[70:01.07]I have the skip, I believe.
[70:02.99]Do I?
[70:03.27]I don't even remember if I activated it.
[70:07.75]That's a good question.
[70:08.63]I'm about to find out.
[70:11.13]Wrong way.
[70:14.57]Why do I have a new character?
[70:15.35]Because I want to be able to do some multiplayer dumb shit.
[70:19.97]And I can't really do that on the current character that I have, so...
[70:25.85]Alright, I got it.
[70:26.33]Good.
[70:27.31]So, I'm just ready.
[70:30.13]I'm ready to play.
[70:33.41]Should I put down my soapstone up here?
[70:44.82]Why can I not take the dried finger?
[70:47.50]Here we are.
[70:51.00]Undead Parish.
[70:51.56]We're right here.
[70:54.60]Why can I not use this?
[70:58.69]Like I said, I'll put my soapstone down.
[71:05.07]Leave a summoning sign.
[71:06.25]This pulls me in?
[71:07.62]Or... Be summoned to another world.
[71:09.92]No, I need the... I need to pull people in.
[71:17.48]I started the game offline.
[71:19.06]Did I?
[71:27.57]Oh, fuck, right, because it... God damn it.
[71:29.47]It's an offline mode.
[71:32.77]Hand in the ass.
[71:37.79]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[71:38.59]I know I, like, reloaded the game.
[71:47.62]777lucky is the password.
[71:50.80]I'll be pulling you in.
[71:51.50]Alright, we're going to use the dried finger.
[71:57.70]And now here we go.
[71:59.26]Sack face.
[71:59.90]I'm sorry.
[72:00.72]That is against Sir Caesar.
[72:04.64]Knight.
[72:08.06]Just kill me.
[72:09.01]No, wait.
[72:09.53]Why can I... Aren't these guys way over leveled?
[72:11.75]Alright.
[72:15.95]Flog.
[72:16.49]Flog, you're coming in.
[72:22.87]Also, let's pull in...
[72:26.09]Aren't these guys, like, really high level?
[72:28.79]Or am I insane?
[72:32.52]Yeah, I don't... I want people that are coming in that are, like, level 20.
[72:35.48]Not, like, level 70.
[72:40.68]No, I don't want giant dad here.
[72:46.44]God damn it.
[72:47.06]I just fucking did it.
[72:52.03]Somebody invaded us.
[72:53.11]Just let it... It's alright.
[72:54.53]Just don't die.
[72:58.16]Everyone wants me to summon, uh, Fubuku?
[73:01.10]What is it?
[73:01.40]What was it?
[73:01.96]I just missed it.
[73:04.62]That's a knight.
[73:05.18]There's Caesar.
[73:06.84]Where is it right here?
[73:07.50]Kanye West.
[73:08.56]And... No, just kill me.
[73:09.54]Where was it?
[73:16.42]Hello?
[73:19.72]Audrey?
[73:21.56]Duelist?
[73:24.14]I already... I missed you.
[73:24.84]I don't know where you are.
[73:26.74]This person doesn't even have a name.
[73:28.55]Wait, hey, get out of here!
[73:39.80]I was just screaming like a fucking raccoon on my, like, front lawn.
[73:45.18]That wasn't even angry, that was like, get out of here, you little raccoon!
[73:50.86]Get out of here, bear!
[73:55.25]Get on out of here!
[74:02.57]Yeah, that guy just turned the corner with his shotgun and killed us.
[74:04.73]Alright, well, thanks.
[74:08.20]Thanks a lot, man.
[74:09.28]Now I have to walk all the way back there.
[74:12.76]How much humanity do I have?
[74:13.76]I only have five fucking humanity.
[74:26.55]Somebody drop... No, don't hack me.
[74:28.49]You don't have to hack me.
[74:33.87]Go back to where we were.
[74:34.81]We have to get six people in, or at least four people to fight the gargoyles.
[74:40.32]It's important to me.
[74:46.10]I can't believe we even killed Giant Dad.
[74:47.80]That's like, seems impossible.
[74:57.55]It's like birds on a bird feeder and the squirrel gets on the bird feeder.
[75:01.55]And you go out there and you take really quick, fast walking steps.
[75:04.18]Hey, hey, hey, get it!
[75:17.75]Alright, hi guys.
[75:21.29]I'm back.
[75:25.31]Giant dad got caught off guard.
[75:28.05]Alright, well, Pepperoni's coming in here.
[75:33.77]777 Lucky is the password.
[75:38.87]I'm going to get invaded by the same guy.
[75:40.49]Alright, hey, Pepperoni.
[75:49.78]That fucking face.
[75:52.02]Audrey.
[75:54.34]Alright, I kind of want Screaming Guy.
[75:56.16]He seems like fun to have here.
[76:02.17]Get Giant Dad again.
[76:03.11]Where's Giant Dad?
[76:07.59]There he is.
[76:16.11]He looks like 2D from the gorillas.
[76:21.11]He really does.
[76:26.01]Alright.
[76:26.97]Now we got the three people here.
[76:29.65]We got the team of four.
[76:34.45]Giant Dad, you have to make sure we stay alive.
[76:36.02]It's very important that you stick with us.
[76:41.78]Oh, well, thanks to humanity, man.
[76:45.16]Alright, let's go beat the Bell Gargoyles.
[76:49.82]So we gotta go up here.
[76:50.56]Alright, you guys all have to go first.
[76:56.32]So, good luck.
[77:02.62]Alright, these health bars kind of need to get out of the way.
[77:07.22]I feel like we're pulling trash in Warcraft.
[77:09.40]With the amount of health, like, overlapping health bars.
[77:17.93]This is like... People... Okay, let me just tell you.
[77:20.57]Like, honestly, you can play the game however you want, right?
[77:24.31]If you have, like, three friends you want to play Dark Souls with.
[77:26.67]But, man, it's not even the same experience.
[77:30.45]It's completely different...
[77:32.74]That is not even remotely the same.
[77:34.36]It's just like walking around and just blowing rooms up.
[77:41.89]This is the way the game was meant to be played.
[77:43.51]Alright, let's go kill the gargoyles.
[77:45.95]Alright, remember.
[77:51.09]I have to stay alive and you guys fight the boss.
[77:54.17]That's how it works.
[77:54.81]Because you guys are expendable.
[77:58.25]I mean that in the kindest possible way.
[78:00.93]How fast can you beat the gargoyles?
[78:06.57]Here we go.
[78:09.94]Do we all have to skip the cutscene?
[78:11.40]I can't skip the cutscene.
[78:15.86]Do you guys think that they can beat the gargoyles in less than 10 seconds?
[78:20.04]What do you think?
[78:24.81]Press X?
[78:25.49]I can't do anything.
[78:26.91]I have to sit here and watch it.
[78:30.72]Okay, let's count.
[78:31.23]I'm gonna count to ten.
[78:40.17]Okay, in 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17... This is not even fun!
[79:14.60]That wasn't even fun!
[79:15.52]And now they're gone.
[79:26.99]Well, thanks for the souls.
[79:36.05]Back to Battle Royale.
[79:37.85]No, we didn't- Now I want to play, because now we have this place open.
[79:42.51]It's time for us to go on an adventure and we have to, look, invade us.
[79:45.79]Stop us from our fucking mission, man.
[79:52.04]I don't even think we got to the end of the last before they were gone.
[79:56.84]What is it, like 25?
[79:57.38]Right?
[79:59.86]I think we got to like 20.
[80:05.94]Play the rest of the game without attacking.
[80:10.46]Alright, so there's that.
[80:11.26]It's wrong.
[80:12.58]Let's go.
[80:12.94]25.
[80:19.92]Haha.
[80:21.26]Don't walk off the edge, dude.
[80:25.52]Go into other people's games?
[80:27.82]I could do that, too.
[80:34.83]Green tree.
[80:38.80]Does this guy have anything I need?
[80:40.90]Not really.
[80:46.72]Kill this guy?
[80:47.90]No.
[80:51.58]Alright.
[80:52.36]It's time to go back.
[80:54.24]Now we can start.
[80:54.86]This is the garden, right?
[81:03.40]What's the correct way to get out of here?
[81:05.26]I don't even remember.
[81:09.04]Is there a way to go down now?
[81:11.38]It's been so long since I've been here.
[81:19.38]Time for bone.
[81:21.26]Actually, I probably should get a few of these.
[81:28.05]Upgrade by, I have, it's already plus three.
[81:31.51]Let's buy a few of these.
[81:34.03]I like three of them.
[81:35.63]Alright, let's go.
[81:46.39]Learn the gesture?
[81:46.99]I don't want the gesture.
[81:48.51]It's going to weigh me down.
[81:52.25]Alright, we're doing 20, 20, 20.
[81:55.60]And then let's get some vitality here because we're low on health.
[81:59.02]Level 21.
[82:05.56]Kill the blacksmith to get to Sif?
[82:09.63]Use the firekeeper's soul?
[82:10.71]Yeah.
[82:16.83]Alright.
[82:19.83]We're ready.
[82:21.49]So now the next area we need to get to... Uh, is from, uh... New Londo, right?
[82:33.17]No.
[82:34.91]Let's try to remember here.
[82:39.01]New Londo from... Or down... To the depths?
[82:45.43]Like down at the, uh...
[82:51.95]Because you go from... We gotta go down to, like, the lower berg, right?
[82:57.90]No, I think I did.
[83:00.06]Did I get the way to go down to the lower berg?
[83:04.06]Capra Demon, yeah.
[83:05.24]And that's back to undead.
[83:07.18]Hold on a second.
[83:11.09]I guess I could... Let me just go to the blacksmith.
[83:17.41]Can I kill the blacksmith?
[83:18.29]Like, will I be able to fight him?
[83:29.13]He's going to kick my ass though, isn't he?
[83:30.23]Yeah, but why would you?
[83:38.12]That's true.
[83:43.92]Let's go down here.
[83:51.64]No, I'm not going to fight the blacksmith.
[83:52.78]I need him to upgrade my hands.
[84:02.60]We could go down here.
[84:04.94]I think that's what I'm going to do.
[84:06.18]Let's go this way.
[84:17.50]Alright.
[84:21.48]Do I have any more to upgrade?
[84:27.48]I do not have enough to upgrade.
[84:28.92]It's plus three.
[84:33.15]Alright, let's go down here.
[84:34.23]Alright, let's see those summoning signs, guys.
[84:47.14]Put him right at the blacksmith.
[84:47.94]We're going down here.
[84:50.48]He sells the Titanite, does he?
[84:53.30]Oh yeah, he does.
[84:53.78]That's right.
[84:56.72]I don't have enough to upgrade.
[84:59.60]You can't summon to get into Darkroot?
[85:00.86]Okay.
[85:01.56]Well, hold on.
[85:02.02]Let me...
[85:10.13]Am I doing a pass?
[85:10.85]Do I have enough to upgrade this shit?
[85:15.75]I do.
[85:16.09]Okay.
[85:17.29]Cestus.
[85:18.28]Plus four.
[85:20.02]Cestus plus five.
[85:22.18]I need three shards.
[85:23.72]I need more souls.
[85:26.66]Use the rubbish.
[85:27.30]Alright, let's go.
[85:29.10]Get your summoning signs out here.
[85:33.96]I'm going to try to have a plus 15 Cestus.
[85:35.72]Whoops.
[85:38.23]Whoops.
[85:41.37]Don't fucking kill me right now.
[85:46.89]Didn't think I could see that coming from a mile away.
[85:49.36]You're dreaming.
[85:50.92]Alright.
[85:53.44]He's not coming out here, is he?
[85:56.49]I'm ready for the summons.
[86:09.22]Going out with the summoning... I can't do it here?
[86:11.42]There we go, okay.
[86:27.75]This is fucking terrible!
[86:29.33]This is the worst!
[86:34.28]Alright, you guys have to carry me.
[86:40.83]What do we got?
[86:41.81]Okay, we got, like, Medusa.
[86:43.37]We got Sudsboy.
[86:44.63]Is that supposed to be, like, soap in his hair?
[86:52.64]Who's this?
[86:54.08]Is it a thief?
[87:02.11]Uh, no, no, no.
[87:03.49]Okay, but Chunky.
[87:07.09]This guy is, like, mac and cheese, isn't he?
[87:13.60]That guy looks alright.
[87:16.58]There's the IGN review.
[87:19.80]Should I invite the guy from IGN in?
[87:22.52]See what his name is.
[87:24.45]Yeah.
[87:25.47]Let's do it.
[87:28.93]Alright, guys.
[87:32.47]I can summon this guy, though.
[87:33.83]Why would I do that?
[87:44.44]Is this guy going to ruin everything?
[87:53.52]Don't like... Okay, I want like a bunch of people in here.
[87:55.62]Don't screw this up.
[87:57.84]Alright, here's what's good.
[87:58.41]Wait till this guy has summoned everybody.
[87:59.83]And we're going to get in all four corners of him.
[88:01.43]And if he tries anything funny, instantly kill him.
[88:06.79]Right?
[88:07.23]If he tries... Surround him.
[88:08.47]When he's... Surround him.
[88:10.77]If he does anything fucking funny...
[88:13.67]Smash R1.
[88:17.95]Alright, is he going to play along?
[88:19.17]Alright, if you're going to play along, you've got to go first.
[88:24.23]You are the one that can pave the way here, man.
[88:29.32]We've got to wait for him to go.
[88:31.06]He has to go first.
[88:32.00]Oh, wait, he can't move.
[88:32.80]Alright, let him out.
[88:35.90]Go on.
[88:38.62]You have five seconds to comply.
[88:41.34]Five.
[88:43.28]What's going on over there?
[88:45.28]Four.
[88:48.10]What is going on?
[88:50.84]Alright.
[88:51.22]Five.
[88:52.72]Four.
[88:54.16]Three.
[88:55.74]Two.
[88:57.32]One.
[88:57.49]You got to go.
[88:58.39]I don't want you to have to die.
[89:00.21]Kill him.
[89:03.61]He didn't listen.
[89:05.73]He didn't listen to us.
[89:06.89]Kill him.
[89:17.63]Uh-oh, don't let him get away.
[89:21.63]No, there's enough stream delay.
[89:22.55]It's like two seconds.
[89:24.57]What?
[89:24.87]You should have listened.
[89:27.01]You needed to listen to us.
[89:28.07]We need to be a team.
[89:32.43]Alright, let's go.
[89:35.97]That guy's going to invade now.
[89:37.08]Now let's go.
[89:42.52]We gotta work together.
[89:43.24]Get to the boss and kill the boss.
[89:45.43]That's very important.
[89:47.77]We're like the Wizard of Oz.
[89:48.69]We got the lizard who's the lion.
[89:50.51]We got the tin man who's just white and tinny looking.
[89:53.87]And then we got the lion right there.
[89:55.03]He's orange.
[89:56.69]That means I get to be Dorothy.
[90:01.90]We're gonna get invaded by the Wicked Witch of the West.
[90:14.41]Alright, let's do it.
[90:15.42]Can we, like, walk together and do, like, a Wizard of Oz thing?
[90:22.24]Alright, so wait.
[90:23.46]Somebody look it up.
[90:25.00]Dorothy was in the middle.
[90:27.12]The Tin Man was on the left.
[90:29.82]Well, they didn't walk the yellow brick road.
[90:31.34]They, like, skipped it.
[90:32.16]How do I get rid of these health bars?
[90:39.67]No, I don't have two lines.
[90:42.10]This is the Scarecrow.
[90:43.80]This is the Tin Man.
[90:44.72]And there's the Cowardly Lion.
[90:45.84]Alright, I can't touch that, right?
[90:49.26]Because they'll disappear.
[90:51.12]Let's keep going.
[90:52.48]Can I touch that bonfire?
[90:57.63]Won't these guys all go away?
[91:01.21]I can light it.
[91:01.73]Okay.
[91:08.55]Why can I not do this?
[91:14.20]Is there something fighting us over here?
[91:15.38]I can't.
[91:21.84]You can't do it.
[91:22.59]Alright.
[91:23.93]Being invaded?
[91:24.61]It doesn't look like it.
[91:25.41]Alright, let's keep going.
[91:32.13]Everyone wants to be summoned here.
[91:37.36]Now, this is like the butterfly, isn't it?
[91:40.02]I'm with this item.
[91:40.92]Come in here.
[91:45.39]Protect me.
[91:46.51]Protect Arthie at all costs.
[91:49.66]Oh my god, I'm going to die.
[91:56.50]I have to summon the invaders?
[91:58.42]They can't just... If you can't use humanity, you're being invaded.
[92:04.78]Where the hell are they?
[92:12.92]Wait, I just summoned Giant Dad.
[92:15.08]Alright, we gotta get out of here.
[92:17.32]Bro, I just brought in two Giant Dads?
[92:20.12]Oh god, get it, go, go, get through this now.
[92:22.64]Get out of here.
[92:26.31]Alright, that's not good.
[92:27.63]I didn't know there were two of them.
[92:33.93]I think we can outrun them.
[92:40.88]Here he comes.
[92:42.58]Here he comes.
[92:43.26]Wait, is he friendly or is he not friendly?
[92:45.79]Because there are two of them.
[92:50.19]Leave him be for now.
[92:54.89]If he wants to fuck around, he knows what's going to happen.
[92:58.25]He's got a fireball in his hand.
[92:59.59]Just watch it.
[93:08.14]Oh god.
[93:11.16]Are they fighting over here?
[93:12.54]Alright, we got the Cowardly Lion versus Giant Dead.
[93:21.48]Alright, like, none of your bullshit.
[93:27.24]Look at the stone statue people have summoned.
[93:31.62]I'm too afraid to go over there.
[93:38.28]Nice work.
[93:47.08]He's running away.
[93:47.62]Alright, leave him be.
[93:48.36]Leave him be.
[93:49.18]He's not going to... I know.
[93:51.99]Let's go.
[93:52.79]We've got to keep moving.
[93:53.53]That guy's going to just keep baiting us.
[94:01.71]So how many people can invade?
[94:09.64]Wait, wait, wait.
[94:10.84]Here he is.
[94:11.14]Here he is.
[94:21.34]Alright, he's dead.
[94:22.16]We did it.
[94:22.52]Congratulations.
[94:26.28]We're getting so many souls, too.
[94:27.66]Jesus.
[94:36.74]Point downwards?
[94:42.78]Alright, let's kill the butterfly.
[94:51.00]Come on in.
[94:55.02]This is such overkill.
[94:59.51]We all can't even fit on here.
[95:03.59]This is just bring your friends- Oh, don't die!
[95:05.75]Don't die though.
[95:06.29]I was gonna say this is bring your friends to the zoo.
[95:11.94]We're just walking down a path where there's a giant, like, bird.
[95:19.92]Is he hitting him?
[95:21.38]He is, kind of.
[95:25.99]I'm just eating these every time.
[95:27.53]Alright, land so we can kill you in one second.
[95:38.76]Here we go.
[95:39.22]Alright, this is gonna happen very quickly.
[95:46.88]Really?
[95:47.20]Oh, he's gonna kill us all!
[95:52.32]We didn't kill him?
[95:53.98]He didn't die?
[95:54.64]Oh, man.
[95:57.50]Why is it going after me?
[96:03.94]It's dead.
[96:07.07]Thanks a lot for playing, guys.
[96:08.77]That was a lot of fun.
[96:09.75]This is just watch a guy get carried through the game.
[96:13.95]Nothing interesting is happening.
[96:15.25]I'm just walking into boss doors and winning.
[96:17.63]And that's it.
[96:25.26]I am also watching somebody play Dark Souls.
[96:29.07]I'm streaming the game, but I'm not playing it.
[96:31.71]We're both watching.
[96:32.97]Together.
[96:42.51]Watchtower basement key.
[96:44.10]Oh my GOD!
[97:09.07]That's 20,000 souls.
[97:12.15]I have to go get them.
[97:13.07]I have to get them.
[97:15.84]Oh my fucking god.
[97:17.18]Oh, I'm sorry.
[97:20.58]I was like watching the game and I didn't even... I haven't been able to play.
[97:24.12]I haven't been able to play the game since we started doing this.
[97:28.18]I watched three streamers beat the butterfly.
[97:30.94]Oh, what the fuck?
[97:38.55]I'm gonna die again.
[97:40.75]Didn't I beat the game?
[97:41.47]Yeah.
[97:42.51]We're just sticking around.
[97:44.01]I wanted to at least have some multiplayer fun until we moved on completely from Dark Souls.
[97:50.17]And I'm... Am I going the wrong way?
[97:51.78]I hope you guys are enjoying the stream.
[98:00.52]All I've done so far is walk off of an edge.
[98:05.32]Where's my iframes there?
[98:14.45]Can I play Dark Souls 2?
[98:16.49]I've already beat Dark Souls 2.
[98:19.47]At least once or twice, so... What is... Oh, god damn it, god damn it, god damn it, god damn it, god damn it, god damn it, god damn it!
[98:39.00]Is he done?
[98:42.07]No, they're not done.
[98:43.97]I have to kill this guy.
[98:50.35]Just get over here already.
[98:51.28]I forgot the reach on this thing is so little.
[99:01.46]Get off.
[99:02.72]Get off the edge.
[99:04.42]Oh, yeah.
[99:10.39]Okay, let me just get my souls and I'm gonna get out of here.
[99:20.48]This is gonna actually be a terrible run.
[99:25.62]Do I have it on my bar?
[99:26.38]Just in case something gets hairy.
[99:34.48]No, I'm not gonna summon anybody right here.
[99:36.30]I just need to get the items I lost.
[99:44.59]There's one guy blocking the door.
[99:45.71]I remember this.
[99:51.07]Alright.
[99:52.77]Where are my souls?
[99:56.77]Yeah, boss is dead, so I can't summon.
[100:04.50]Did I go buy them?
[100:05.46]Where are they?
[100:16.61]Oh, right, over here.
[100:20.67]I thought I went all the way to the bottom.
[100:25.85]Fall off again.
[100:35.79]Give me my fucking souls, man.
[100:38.54]Okay, we're good.
[100:41.56]Now, the next step here is...
[100:45.99]What is the actual next step here?
[100:47.33]Because now I have the key to the basement, right?
[101:04.52]Oh, the 26.
[101:07.86]We can do the catacombs.
[101:09.92]Let's do the catacombs, right?
[101:11.32]Let's go kill Pinwheel.
[101:14.45]Sounds good to me.
[101:15.56]But I can't warp, though, so we have to go backwards.
[101:21.06]Fight Sif?
[101:21.94]I need the thing to fight Sif.
[101:23.54]I don't have it.
[101:24.60]It's 20,000 souls, right?
[101:32.39]Beat Pinwheel for the first time?
[101:33.37]Well, I'm going to have, like, three people, so it'll be impossible to lose.
[101:39.39]Well, almost just fucking lost it right there.
[101:44.05]kill the smith.
[101:44.65]I don't even need to use my weapons.
[101:46.63]But this character from here on out... Alright, I gotta slow down here because I'm gonna die.
[101:53.91]This is a death here.
[101:59.06]Almost.
[102:00.04]Very close.
[102:06.82]Just farm invasions.
[102:10.02]That's so cheap.
[102:15.05]Alright, let's get back here.
[102:15.93]I should be able to get this to plus five.
[102:29.42]Reinforce it to plus five and then kill Andre.
[102:38.44]No, I just gave him the ember, so I can't do that now.
[102:40.54]Alright, where is it?
[102:42.59]Three, I need three.
[102:45.15]Purchase item.
[102:46.11]One, two, three.
[102:47.51]Can only afford two.
[102:50.01]Well, isn't that just great?
[102:50.77]I'll just break the thing that the butterflies shit out of her.
[102:52.73]Actually, I can probably do it with these.
[102:58.71]He drops the key to Sif.
[103:08.13]Alright, well, I don't think I can beat him.
[103:12.98]Alright, he's at plus five.
[103:15.70]I could do Divine, but I don't know if that's Faith scaling.
[103:18.91]No, I'm not going to fight him.
[103:24.57]We're going to go down to the catacombs.
[103:27.69]And I'm going to summon three people.
[103:34.78]That means I have to go back to Firelink, which is not that way.
[103:42.25]Am I building strength for the fist?
[103:44.41]Yeah.
[103:45.10]I'm doing just straight... Because it's 51-51%, right?
[103:50.62]For strength and dexterity.
[104:02.62]Don't die to pinwheel.
[104:03.48]I'm not going to die to pinwheel.
[104:08.93]Is corn a sandwich?
[104:10.17]Are you really asking that question to me right now?
[104:13.27]Oh no, is corn dog a sandwich?
[104:15.99]I thought you were asking if corn was a sandwich.
[104:19.72]No, it's not.
[104:20.28]Corn is a vegetable that you eat with your hands.
[104:25.06]It's not a sandwich.
[104:25.78]You don't put bread... You... You do not put bread... A corn between two pieces of bread.
[104:34.57]I'm sorry, guys.
[104:35.19]That's not how it works.
[104:44.76]What do I get for this?
[104:47.20]Two humanity.
[104:50.51]Alright, that's great.
[105:10.14]Is cornbread a sandwich?
[105:12.22]Okay, cornbread would be a sandwich if you cut the cornbread in half and then put something in between the cornbread.
[105:24.49]I sold the butterfly.
[105:25.59]I just don't want it.
[105:26.75]And I have one more of these, right?
[105:31.63]No, that didn't do anything for me.
[105:33.05]I'm glad I just used that.
[105:34.87]Alright, let me reverse holo.
[105:42.79]Let's head down to the graveyard.
[105:45.13]Well, there are items that I didn't get over here, aren't there?
[106:00.12]This guy's a little bit tricky, isn't he?
[106:08.62]You rascal.
[106:10.42]You will soon regret that.
[106:14.15]Ow.
[106:17.87]None of these guys drop anything actually worth of any value, right?
[106:25.17]From my understanding.
[106:29.95]Does this guy actually serve any purpose at all?
[106:35.58]Is he like a quest line?
[106:36.60]Do you do anything with this dude?
[106:40.30]By the way, the reason why I did that was because I wanted the level.
[106:45.55]He's just a tutorial guy.
[106:46.53]Okay, he just tells you where to go.
[106:47.63]Yeah, that makes sense.
[106:48.19]Alright, let's go.
[106:50.75]He turns into a hollow later.
[106:52.25]Yeah.
[106:53.39]Alright, let's go around to the grave down to the catacombs, right?
[106:56.99]Which is down... I want to get the items here first, just for fun.
[107:02.88]Yeah, he's the guy that goes hollow in Nuwando.
[107:04.50]Alright.
[107:11.62]Treasures!
[107:12.04]Remember these?
[107:16.95]Actually, that's good that I got those bones.
[107:20.65]Morning star.
[107:21.29]I'm not going to use it.
[107:25.91]There's the cracked eye orb.
[107:27.11]Alright, let's go.
[107:30.59]I am ready for your summoning signs.
[107:40.79]Can they appear here?
[107:43.83]Oh my god.
[107:46.93]Forgot these guys are a little tricky.
[107:50.95]I can't do this.
[107:51.60]I can't parry on the stairs.
[108:00.72]Dick.
[108:04.64]I'm not going to die to the skeletons.
[108:05.96]Don't worry.
[108:06.42]That's a little stagger, I remember.
[108:15.95]Get off my screen.
[108:16.61]Get off the screen!
[108:22.07]Alright, can I not see their summoning stones yet?
[108:26.47]What type of phone do I have?
[108:27.25]I have an iPhone.
[108:30.95]Oh, you fucked with me.
[108:31.81]You fucked with me!
[108:39.50]No, this is bad.
[108:40.44]This is bad!
[108:44.08]I can't even, I have to be so close.
[108:46.48]Don't fucking panic.
[108:47.68]Oh my god damn it.
[108:51.06]It's like, I gotta punch him like fucking five times.
[109:08.65]I'm not gonna die to the skeletons, but too bad.
[109:10.55]It's too bad.
[109:11.95]Too bad I died to the skeletons.
[109:14.16]You know, if I was playing this on any other character, they would die in one hit.
[109:19.34]One fucking hit, those guys die.
[109:23.10]But no, with the fists on, you gotta go like this.
[109:26.79]Oh shit, hold on!
[109:29.21]One!
[109:30.13]Two!
[109:30.85]Three!
[109:31.31]Oh fuck!
[109:32.77]Four!
[109:33.77]Oh!
[109:34.59]Five!
[109:34.97]I thought this was gonna be fun!
[109:51.07]What do I get?
[109:51.53]Where is it?
[109:51.91]I can go just down this way, can't I?
[109:57.20]That's framped.
[110:09.26]Just give me my soul, and just get me out of here.
[110:15.23]Literally, I gotta be, like, right inside of their bodies to hurt them.
[110:19.30]And I gotta hit him a dozen fucking times.
[110:21.96]Like a hundred times.
[110:22.86]Keep this going.
[110:31.81]And I saw the shiny blue thing and I had to get it.
[110:34.31]It's just binoculars.
[110:35.79]What are you thinking, Jeremy?
[110:45.20]Where's the other way?
[110:45.78]Down here, right?
[110:46.30]Yeah.
[110:50.60]Alright, let's see those summoning stones.
[111:02.84]So can the signs be put here, or do I have to go a little bit deeper?
[111:13.19]Have I ever heard of Dark Souls?
[111:15.23]Um...
[111:17.58]Yeah, I think so.
[111:19.36]Password 777.
[111:20.58]Lucky.
[111:23.34]I gotta get to the first bonfire.
[111:24.30]Oh yeah, I forgot these guys spawn again.
[111:25.72]This is an awkward run to the bonfire, isn't it?
[111:38.24]Oh, fuck.
[111:48.54]Just fall.
[111:51.84]Isn't it, like, right here?
[111:52.86]It's, like, in the hole over here somewhere?
[111:54.42]Oh, fuck you.
[111:56.86]It's right over there.
[111:57.38]I missed it.
[111:58.76]Oh, my God.
[111:59.00]I got summoned.
[111:59.58]Summoned.
[111:59.84]Quick, quick, quick.
[112:00.36]Go, go, go.
[112:00.84]Oh, my God.
[112:01.19]Oh, my God.
[112:01.51]Hold on.
[112:01.79]Wait, wait.
[112:02.79]I can see them.
[112:03.21]I don't even know who this... Okay.
[112:06.37]I wish it didn't go to cancel immediately.
[112:08.67]If I click the sign.
[112:10.13]Please.
[112:11.07]Kanye West is coming in the game.
[112:13.81]Who the fuck is this?
[112:15.69]Did I just get invaded?
[112:18.91]No, what are you doing?
[112:22.83]Kanye, come on, Kanye!
[112:27.82]Help me please!
[112:29.52]Alright, that was so stupid.
[112:31.56]That was the stupidest thing ever.
[112:32.82]I just like sucked back to his body.
[112:54.44]If only Kanye was summoned faster.
[112:58.12]Alright, um... Let's play the game called Can I Get Down to the Bonfire?
[113:04.01]Sigh.
[113:31.11]That was a real Kanye.
[113:35.07]That's not the correct way.
[113:44.88]Can I get down there again?
[113:46.06]Let's see.
[113:46.44]Am I going to get camped here?
[113:47.96]I feel like I'm running to get my body in Warcraft after a rogue just ruined my night.
[114:00.05]I didn't get through that?
[114:00.82]I love a god.
[114:08.06]Okay, come on.
[114:08.70]Where are those signs?
[114:09.32]Oh, god.
[114:14.63]No, I can't see them yet.
[114:17.37]Oh, no.
[114:18.03]Oh, no.
[114:18.35]I'm locked in here.
[114:19.49]Oh, no.
[114:20.27]This is bad.
[114:20.83]I need help.
[114:23.51]Thank god.
[114:23.91]Who is it?
[114:29.42]Oh, fuck.
[114:30.94]Alright, well, good luck.
[114:31.79]Hopefully you get in.
[114:33.55]And you too.
[114:34.99]I can't summon you.
[114:36.69]Oh my god, please no.
[114:38.15]Like, honest to goodness.
[114:41.43]Honest to goodness.
[114:43.45]Come on, get in here, please, and help me.
[114:47.66]Yes, I know I summoned him.
[114:48.60]I'm aware.
[114:49.00]I'm just fucking dead.
[114:52.86]This is like...
[115:18.87]I'm just gonna walk down there with this shield and just hold the button down.
[115:21.99]I could attack them, that's true, but I also cannot kill them.
[115:25.86]It takes me like three to four hundred percent more time to kill an enemy with these fucking dumb gloves.
[115:30.70]So they're coming off, they're terrible.
[115:33.33]I'm gonna put on like a regular weapon until I can get down there, because they're the worst in the fu- What a terrible fucking item.
[115:42.05]I'm gonna one-hit the skeletons with this.
[115:57.22]Instead of dancing around and sticking fingers up my ass, I can actually play the game.
[116:02.66]Let's see.
[116:14.59]I'm gonna do a test.
[116:20.13]Why?
[116:20.49]Wait, hold on a second.
[116:21.53]What?
[116:22.77]Wait, I am so angry!
[116:25.60]You can't even believe how angry I am.
[116:27.30]Why are they taking so many?
[116:30.41]I'm fucking beyond angry right now.
[116:33.76]Why?
[116:34.56]What?
[116:59.07]I'm not ready for this zone apparently.
[117:01.97]It's because I did a 20-20 build and I don't have any... And they come back too.
[117:11.63]Oh, now I remember why I hated this zone.
[117:15.79]I don't know these are upgraded and even without being upgraded.
[117:20.16]Just give me a fucking huge heavy equipment and like a shield and I'm just gonna walk down there.
[117:26.54]Fuck off, buddy.
[117:33.91]No upgrade.
[117:34.49]I'm gonna- I have to put on like the stupid fucking cestus.
[117:39.83]I don't care if I'm fat rolling.
[117:40.93]I already took a hit.
[118:02.45]You know, I think I'm too tilted.
[118:03.83]I think I have to delete this game from my hard drive.
[118:07.67]Like, I already beat the whole game.
[118:08.95]And like, I want to do this fun thing.
[118:10.70]And I just, my brain can't do it right now.
[118:12.62]I'm going to delete this game from my fucking Steam library.
[118:15.64]I already beat it.
[118:16.22]I don't care anymore.
[118:20.28]Like, we already did all this shit.
[118:22.50]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[118:23.68]Don't even.
[118:30.68]Die, please.
[118:40.46]God damn it.
[118:48.07]Just fucking bring pepperoni and I don't even care.
[119:13.18]I can't touch the bonfire.
[119:15.26]How come I can't touch the bonfire?
[119:28.74]Um, because it's multiplayer.
[119:29.88]Oh god, fucking damn it, man.
[119:34.99]I'll be gone with you all.
[119:35.93]How do I do it?
[119:40.51]Where's the thing?
[119:41.11]Where's the, where's like the be gone with you everybody?
[119:42.97]I don't think I even have it.
[119:47.35]Well, we better not, we can't fuck it up.
[119:57.62]Wait, why'd you go?
[120:05.56]This, it's the separation crystal?
[120:09.30]Oh, there it is.
[120:09.66]Okay, yeah.
[120:10.20]Everyone get out of here.
[120:16.21]Let me just touch this first.
[120:21.87]Okay, um... Help me.
[120:28.03]Help me here.
[120:28.43]You gotta help me.
[120:29.31]No.
[120:29.85]Oh, no.
[120:30.73]What the fuck?
[120:32.85]I can't just get behind him?
[120:36.28]Get him.
[120:37.00]You can do it.
[120:37.44]I know you can.
[120:38.78]Look, just drain.
[120:39.60]Just put lava down here.
[120:40.46]I'm just going to shield and you can save me.
[120:45.86]Good work.
[120:46.18]Good work.
[120:47.12]Teamwork together.
[120:51.80]You did it.
[120:52.32]Thank you.
[120:53.58]Thank you so much.
[120:54.30]Look at his health.
[120:54.84]Okay.
[120:59.18]Now I'm going to send you back home.
[121:01.28]Thanks for hanging out.
[121:02.20]I'll get you back here in a second.
[121:09.85]Touch the stupid bonfire.
[121:18.45]Okay.
[121:19.31]Now we can play the game.
[121:27.98]Good luck.
[121:28.42]No, I want to... That guy's naked.
[121:32.60]It's fine.
[121:46.54]You keep wanting us to bring you in.
[121:48.53]You're just going to kill us.
[121:54.19]Summoning failed?
[121:54.95]Why?
[122:00.03]No, I'm not bringing him in again.
[122:01.13]He's going to cause a ruckus.
[122:08.44]We're going to go and we're going to kill Pinwheel.
[122:10.28]I got a claw.
[122:10.94]Let's take this guy in.
[122:14.42]Oh, now I remember this guy.
[122:15.14]This is the... the Lizard of Oz.
[122:20.76]Alright, we got three... Uh, where was the person that just swole?
[122:34.03]Uh, no, not that just... that saved me.
[122:37.55]They deserve to play.
[122:48.14]Nah, we'll bring in the default guy.
[122:49.54]The default knight guy.
[122:53.06]Alright.
[122:56.52]The guy that named his character the class he's playing.
[123:01.60]Alright, any more of those bad signatures?
[123:06.50]I don't see any.
[123:07.04]I'm ready.
[123:08.62]Welcome.
[123:09.94]It only took us like 30 minutes to do this.
[123:15.22]Let's beat the catacombs.
[123:22.38]Oh, now, by the way, I'm not going to be able to move around.
[123:25.64]Alright, that's fine.
[123:35.37]Let's go.
[123:45.55]Why is it a thong?
[123:47.85]I don't understand why it's a thong.
[123:50.59]Watch out.
[123:50.95]We got the magician over there.
[123:59.74]I didn't kill him there.
[124:01.32]Thank you.
[124:01.68]Come and save me.
[124:02.36]Alright, around the corner.
[124:07.29]Watch out for the skeletons.
[124:15.53]Don't fall off.
[124:17.37]Don't follow him down there.
[124:22.55]Okay, we're good.
[124:26.07]Protect the president.
[124:29.88]Protect the boxer.
[124:38.21]I do have like kind of a chunky hip area, don't I?
[124:40.21]Alright, let's go.
[124:45.95]Keep going to Pinwheel.
[124:47.07]Before the stream ends, I have to kill Pinwheel.
[124:50.57]And I have to do it.
[124:53.05]You have to bring him in.
[124:54.49]You guys are not allowed to attack Pinwheel.
[125:00.34]I gotta beat him as, like, the boxer man.
[125:02.06]Alright, somebody gave a lot of money.
[125:05.65]Hold on a second.
[125:06.23]Let me just see here.
[125:11.11]There was a huge $50 donation from Kali Brady.
[125:15.91]Thank you so much, man.
[125:17.92]And you say, uh, thanks for the salt, Jerma.
[125:20.74]These chips were getting a little bland.
[125:24.94]Thank you so much, dude.
[125:27.24]50 fucking dollars.
[125:27.90]Yeah, I always get salty because I just want to, like, play multiplayer.
[125:35.36]And sometimes I forget.
[125:36.33]Sometimes I forget that you have to jump through, like, 200 hoops to play multiplayer in these games.
[125:47.33]I tried to bring him in.
[125:47.99]Alright, let's go.
[125:57.30]But wasn't there an item back here?
[125:58.26]No.
[126:07.79]You're all just giant dads.
[126:09.59]Like, this... You're just giant dad!
[126:14.19]Is everybody giant dad?
[126:20.01]Watch out for the traps.
[126:20.77]This is where it gets dangerous.
[126:26.44]He's here, and he's coming up right now.
[126:29.18]He's going to show up right here.
[126:30.16]We're in a very bad spot to fight him.
[126:32.70]Don't die by the trap.
[126:34.20]Oh!
[126:36.08]Alright, guys, guys, turn around.
[126:37.54]He's right there.
[126:38.02]Turn around.
[126:43.89]Run away.
[126:49.17]Oh, no, no, no.
[126:50.55]We need to stay together.
[126:51.37]Don't.
[126:55.02]We can't fight him.
[126:56.00]Here.
[126:56.26]This is a bad place to fight him.
[127:02.21]What have I done?
[127:03.79]Alright.
[127:04.53]This is not a bad place.
[127:05.51]But remember, I did just summon another guy.
[127:10.01]Oh, shit.
[127:13.15]Alright.
[127:13.37]Rush him.
[127:13.71]Rush him.
[127:14.22]Rush him.
[127:14.52]Rush him.
[127:14.78]Go.
[127:14.92]Go.
[127:15.06]Go.
[127:15.36]We got another guy coming.
[127:16.00]Rush him.
[127:16.70]Rush him.
[127:17.98]Go forward.
[127:18.36]Fast.
[127:18.68]Rush him.
[127:22.44]He can't fight us all.
[127:23.94]Ow.
[127:24.28]The trap.
[127:29.40]Kick him off the edge!
[127:29.94]Get him off the edge!
[127:30.48]Alright, turn around.
[127:32.42]Alright, it's just Bebop and Rocksteady.
[127:36.80]We're the Ninja Turtles.
[127:38.64]I am obviously... Which one?
[127:41.11]Michelangelo, because he's yellow.
[127:48.09]How is he still alive?
[127:50.07]Oh, fuck.
[127:54.56]Where is he going?
[127:55.26]Oh, man.
[128:01.67]Alright, one down.
[128:02.77]Good work, everybody.
[128:03.35]Alright, there's still a smog out here, though.
[128:08.44]Just keep that in mind.
[128:14.34]There he is, right there.
[128:15.10]Don't let him fool you.
[128:17.32]He's just waiting for us.
[128:25.96]I think they're going in.
[128:30.62]What is that camera doing?
[128:35.58]I can see his hammer.
[128:36.58]You're hiding.
[128:37.88]You can't hide from me.
[128:39.04]I can literally see your giant cartoon body.
[128:46.51]I'm going to fall off.
[128:48.59]He's going to do like an R2.
[128:49.81]Where is he?
[128:54.95]He's going to be in one of these little cubbies.
[128:59.88]Ay yi yi.
[129:02.85]Uh-oh.
[129:03.85]Dark Spirit Alt F4 has invaded.
[129:06.84]Protect me at all costs.
[129:15.94]The smog is still in here, though.
[129:17.80]Remember.
[129:21.08]You just scared the shit out of me.
[129:22.14]I thought you were a bad guy.
[129:24.46]Which direction is he coming from?
[129:25.48]Okay, the smog is down here.
[129:32.81]What do you mean press it now?
[129:34.91]I don't know where to go.
[129:35.55]I don't know what's safe.
[129:42.65]That's not him.
[129:43.03]That's like the passive smog.
[129:49.27]No!
[129:49.72]I just fell off the edge because I tried to run backwards and he was in the way.
[129:52.88]He's right here.
[129:53.32]He's right here.
[129:53.72]Okay.
[129:54.04]Okay.
[129:54.30]There's two of them.
[129:56.08]Just don't let him get us.
[129:57.56]He's got a shield and a single hand.
[130:01.18]He's got a plate in his hand.
[130:05.54]They're chasing him.
[130:06.06]They're going after him.
[130:06.74]Hold on.
[130:07.62]I gotta see him die, otherwise it doesn't happen.
[130:09.07]If you don't see the guy character die on screen, he doesn't die.
[130:11.85]Oh my god, what have you done?
[130:16.27]Just like a TV show or a movie, if he doesn't die on screen, he's still alive.
[130:22.74]Oh no, he's gonna kill him.
[130:24.94]Oh fuck, there's one of my friends down.
[130:28.98]Come on, Chunky!
[130:30.12]Chunky!
[130:30.48]Chunky!
[130:40.94]Keep it up.
[130:41.32]Good work.
[130:41.66]Do you have any Estus?
[130:50.24]Drink the Estus.
[130:53.98]My other friend died.
[130:58.90]I don't know how to help.
[130:59.78]I'm just like a bystander.
[131:01.70]I don't know what to do.
[131:04.88]He's just drinking.
[131:05.91]You gotta drink too, man.
[131:11.18]Am I out of friends?
[131:12.82]Oh, fuck.
[131:20.95]He's gonna do it.
[131:21.57]Come on, do it.
[131:22.49]You can do it.
[131:25.39]Hey, don't... I'll take care of this guy.
[131:28.97]You get that guy up there.
[131:34.43]Oh, my God.
[131:36.32]Yes!
[131:37.66]No!
[131:37.94]No!
[131:53.28]Oh, no!
[131:53.86]Oh, no!
[131:54.46]Oh, no!
[131:55.32]Oh, no!
[131:57.42]I made it.
[131:57.76]Okay, wait.
[131:58.23]Somebody get a sign down here.
[131:59.35]I need... Okay.
[132:11.01]I need to... I gotta pee.
[132:12.43]I'll be right back.
[132:15.55]Give me a second.
[132:16.17]I was gonna... Let me go to the bathroom and get a drink.
[132:18.95]We'll do it.
[132:19.33]We'll...
[132:21.18]We'll delete the game in 10 minutes.
[132:23.23]I'll be right back.
[134:29.67]Alright, let's try this again.
[135:07.30]Alright.
[135:13.44]Hey, welcome back.
[135:14.32]Let's go.
[135:16.77]Gotta take a humanity here.
[135:22.65]Reverse the hollowing.
[135:24.91]Need a new dream team.
[135:28.46]Is it time to uninstall?
[135:29.40]No, not yet.
[135:32.64]Might be soon, though.
[135:33.68]I gotta put on a pair of pants.
[135:39.21]I gotta have the whole outfit here.
[135:40.73]There we go.
[135:41.69]Looks like I have big hands, big gloves.
[135:43.59]Look at this posture.
[135:47.07]I'm like slouched over.
[135:50.76]Do I have any chests?
[135:51.86]No.
[135:52.72]I look stupid.
[135:53.40]Alright, let's see who we're gonna bring in.
[135:55.52]We need a new dream team.
[135:57.54]Sadface is played.
[136:01.21]You look fairly put together, so I'm gonna put Syphilis in the game.
[136:06.97]See if we can find...
[136:11.99]You look pretty put together too.
[136:17.95]Alright, this syphilis.
[136:25.46]Uh, there we go.
[136:27.26]This was my savior last time.
[136:29.00]Coming back in.
[136:36.96]Gotta have the dream team.
[136:38.26]This is a pain in the ass.
[136:42.29]I kinda like the way this guy looks.
[136:43.59]Looks put together like he thought out his costume.
[136:47.45]Uh, Guyton.
[136:48.71]Come on in.
[136:51.88]I have total confidence in the three of yous.
[136:59.30]There's a lot of traps here, just be aware of that.
[137:01.47]Remember, the whole goal is for me to get to Pinwheel.
[137:04.21]And for me to fight him like this, alone.
[137:07.21]You guys can come in and watch.
[137:09.81]But I have to get to Pinwheel and fight him like this and beat him like this.
[137:12.19]Alright.
[137:13.81]Well, somebody already is here.
[137:14.85]Alright.
[137:18.49]The main.
[137:18.85]I got to bring in the main because the other person didn't come in.
[137:27.46]There he is.
[137:27.80]Alright.
[137:33.93]We have to rush this guy down.
[137:35.25]We just do.
[137:35.83]He's going to do a thing.
[137:36.81]I mean, I could watch it.
[137:41.33]I mean, you can, like, you can see his penis.
[137:43.61]So, like, this guy's got to get, in terms of service, he's got to get off stream.
[137:47.60]Like, it's just fucking hanging down there.
[137:48.97]That's, like, just, that's just disgusting.
[137:54.51]So, I have to assume he's probably got the stream open.
[137:57.91]So, here's the plan.
[137:59.35]The plan is... On the count of ten, we are all going to run at him, okay?
[138:06.72]So, once we get to ten... Interestingly, the thing about ten, though, the funny thing about... I can't walk.
[138:13.77]You gotta move forward.
[138:15.33]You gotta move forward.
[138:16.93]No, no, no, I didn't say ten.
[138:17.73]I didn't say ten.
[138:18.53]Hold on.
[138:19.35]I was gonna fucking... I was gonna...
[138:23.29]Get him!
[138:23.67]Get him!
[138:24.13]Swarm him!
[138:24.61]Swarm him!
[138:41.52]Who the fuck is this?
[138:45.32]Chlorine.
[138:48.67]How many people can I summon?
[138:54.85]Oh, that's the guy again.
[138:55.87]He's throwing bombs over there.
[139:04.02]Alright, we just let's... Who knows the quickest way to pinwheel?
[139:08.48]Because that's what we're doing.
[139:10.38]However fast as we can get to pinwheel, I need to watch somebody do it so I can do it too.
[139:16.83]Who knows?
[139:33.78]Oh no, my friend!
[139:34.74]Oh, she died by a skeleton.
[139:37.46]Oh shit.
[139:39.00]Oh, this is not good.
[139:39.98]Syphilis, it's a- Where did my other- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[139:50.47]Did he just get- He just got buried by the skeleton.
[139:54.83]I told you guys these skeletons are the worst.
[140:16.03]Gotta take opportunities when you see them.
[140:22.38]Oh, fuck.
[140:24.60]I need more people.
[140:25.54]Summon your stones here.
[140:27.12]If you can put your summoning stone right here, I can bring you in.
[140:38.31]Got him.
[140:39.39]What?
[140:39.61]He's not dead?
[140:40.57]Oh, he's dead.
[140:41.67]Oh, great.
[140:42.31]That's just great.
[140:45.07]I need to make some phone calls, guys.
[140:46.17]I need to make some phone calls.
[140:48.35]I need to make phone calls.
[140:49.17]Why are these guys so good?
[141:11.80]Don't you dare.
[141:15.34]Get out of my game!
[141:16.52]Get out of my game!
[141:18.08]Alright.
[141:19.98]He's done.
[141:21.22]That's it.
[141:30.58]Alright, put your soap stones down here.
[141:33.62]There they are.
[141:34.02]Okay, I see them already.
[141:35.62]Looking good.
[141:37.89]He's right here.
[141:39.39]I'm not... What, do we think I was born yesterday?
[141:46.96]He's gonna sit there.
[141:47.66]Alright.
[141:48.92]Frank Reynolds, you look heavy and tough.
[141:55.73]You put yours all the way over here.
[141:56.81]Which is a good idea.
[141:58.49]But you were just in the game though, weren't you?
[141:59.77]Alright, bring the crazy guy.
[142:08.85]And let's see over here.
[142:16.04]Frank Reynolds.
[142:16.81]Alright, so that's it.
[142:18.91]Can I not have more than two?
[142:23.77]There's one, two.
[142:28.11]Sudboy's coming in.
[142:29.09]There he is.
[142:31.66]I can't have a third guy?
[142:38.14]I thought I could.
[142:41.72]That's strange.
[142:42.32]Alright, well, let's go.
[142:49.71]Who knows the secret fast way to get to Pinwheel?
[142:54.44]Oh, the invader's the third guy.
[142:55.50]Okay, I get it.
[142:56.00]Alright, I'm gonna follow... So, Frank Reynolds... Oh, goddammit.
[143:03.10]We gotta go.
[143:03.50]We have to move.
[143:03.92]This guy's gonna keep coming into the game.
[143:07.50]Frank Reynolds, you're the leader.
[143:08.46]We're following you.
[143:09.10]Get us to do the shortcut jump down to Pinwheel.
[143:11.88]I don't know where it is, but I'm sure you'll know.
[143:25.33]We gotta move quick.
[143:32.34]We need to find the quick, super fast way to get to Pinwheel.
[143:36.32]I don't know where the quick jump is.
[143:37.88]Think we're getting there?
[143:44.31]This looks correct, right?
[143:47.73]Forget about him.
[143:48.21]He's gonna do that forever.
[143:48.97]We just gotta go.
[143:53.89]Is that the jump?
[143:54.85]Not quite.
[143:55.79]Gotta pull the lever.
[144:01.43]Follow the invader?
[144:02.57]I don't trust the invader at all.
[144:08.29]Jesus.
[144:10.37]What the fuck is this?
[144:14.50]What is going on?
[144:17.78]Did one of the invaders get to boss?
[144:25.18]I don't understand.
[144:32.87]Who the fuck is this?
[144:43.41]What are we looking at here?
[144:48.30]He's just... We're in Smog's game.
[144:52.79]Oh my fucking god.
[144:53.57]Help me, sir.
[144:54.09]Help me.
[144:54.35]You're in my way!

[144:58.25]Oh man, I'm... Alright, I'm following you.
[145:09.93]You're gonna get... I'm so paranoid.
[145:16.77]Alright, invader.
[145:17.73]Show me the shortcut.
[145:20.07]I'm... I am following you.
[145:25.25]We're all following the invader to take us to the shortcut.
[145:28.85]The secret shortcut to get out of here.
[145:31.78]18,000 souls, huh?
[145:33.60]Alright.
[145:34.12]This way?
[145:35.86]Yep.

[146:18.47]I don't know.
[146:18.97]I'm just so... That's not the same fucking way.

[146:32.12]We all did the same thing!
[146:33.20]Alright, bring in the chieftain!

[149:07.05]You go first.
[149:07.81]I forgot where it was.
[149:09.49]It's right there.
[149:15.29]I just bounced off of him and fell in the fucking pit.
[149:18.37]Alright.
[149:19.31]We got a new guy invading.
[149:20.75]So where do we go from here?

[149:39.32]Alright, it's time to fight Pinwheel.
[149:45.32]Thank you, Invader, for showing us the super secret skip.
[149:51.09]I think we lost a guy.
[149:56.41]Alright, where's, um... Where's the last person?
[150:02.11]Did he die?
[150:04.49]I want at least three people to watch me do this.
[150:09.21]Okay.
[150:11.57]Hey, thanks, man.
[150:12.95]You really helped us out here.
[150:14.03]You really did.

[150:18.35]Don't anger him.
[150:19.07]Don't anger him.
[150:20.27]Don't anger him.
[150:20.81]I'm going in.
[150:21.61]I'm going in.
[150:22.09]Don't anger him right before the boss fight.
[150:27.78]Come on, Ed.
[150:30.34]Here's the deal.
[150:32.41]You guys can watch, but do not fight.
[150:35.31]I want to make sure that I can prove that I'm not going to die to pinwheel.
[150:45.95]Look, you can look it, but do not touch anything.
[150:55.52]I can't skip this.
[151:10.96]They're the three, there's the family, the dad, the son, and the mom.
[151:19.28]You guys can watch.
[151:41.83]Don't hurt him.
[151:42.25]Don't fight!
[152:05.66]They're multiplying forever.
[152:40.78]This fucking weapon.
[152:42.88]It takes 70 fucking 4 damage.
[152:51.17]I'm not gonna be able to beat him.
[152:52.88]I don't do enough damage.
[153:13.69]No, no, no, no.
[153:14.37]Do not spawn these guys.
[153:15.29]Wait, it's because he has a ton more health.
[153:24.09]That's what's going on, right?
[153:27.67]I cannot lose to Pinwheel here.
[153:31.27]God damn it.
[153:36.94]Die!
[153:38.14]Oh, fuck.
[153:46.64]He's just spawning people.
[153:54.86]No!
[154:00.67]He has too much health!
[154:03.07]Oh, yikes!
[154:06.78]No, I gotta get rid of the- I gotta take this slow, man, if I have any choice.
[154:10.26]Any chance of beating Pinwheel.
[154:15.51]No, he summoned another one.
[154:16.33]Where is he?
[154:21.20]Oh my fucking lord.
[154:28.22]Did somebody die?
[154:34.09]Alright, almost.
[154:47.31]Oh, that's bad dodge.
[154:48.27]That's bad.
[154:48.79]That's very bad.
[154:50.01]This is very bad.
[154:52.57]Oh my fucking god, where did they all come from?
[154:54.07]Oh my god.
[154:54.93]Oh my god, why did it spawn so many?
[154:57.15]Why did it spawn so many of them?
[154:58.41]Do you understand why this is happening right now?
[155:10.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[155:37.79]No, no, no, no, I have to do it I have to do it do not hurt no you killed it you can't you last hit him You just last hit him
[155:53.58]No, that counts.
[155:54.24]That counts.
[155:54.87]That counts.
[155:55.33]That counts.
[155:56.13]Don't even tell me that doesn't.
[156:09.85]That doesn't count because I didn't get the last hit.
[156:12.22]I didn't get the extra fucking gold.
[156:14.54]Yeah, I didn't die to pinwheel though.
[156:18.80]That's what everybody thought was going to happen.
[156:30.35]Alright.
[156:31.29]Get your signs down.
[156:32.65]I'm going.
[156:33.51]We're still going.
[156:39.61]Get your signs down on the Tomb of Giants.
[156:44.18]You didn't die, but you didn't kill him either.
[156:45.62]But that's not fair, because I did.
[156:57.21]Was there anything else back here?
[156:59.79]There is, isn't there?
[157:00.39]I don't think I even went back here last time.
[157:17.36]Need to kill Ornstein and Smough.
[157:24.42]Alright, I need to just go.
[157:29.18]I don't think I can even go over there.
[157:33.38]Yeah, no, I do say smog.
[157:34.42]Alright, put your signs down.
[157:43.26]Can I even see them on the ground from here?
[157:51.04]Oh my god, Amos has walked off.
[157:52.18]Alright, get your signs down.
[157:55.77]Nito is blocked, he can't summon here.
[157:59.14]Oh, really?
[157:59.58]Oh, shit.
[158:04.61]Well.
[158:09.47]Okay.
[158:18.12]Interesting stuff.
[158:19.54]So I'm gonna go this way.
[158:22.61]Dad's bone out of here.
[158:28.09]So now from here, am I, are we actually going to do these?
[158:30.95]What are we doing right now?
[158:42.43]Am I beating the game like this?
[158:43.85]I think I'll have a meltdown by then.
[158:48.79]A real one.
[159:05.00]Sen's gates.
[159:05.64]No, we're not going to beat the whole game.
[159:08.68]Alright.
[159:12.89]Let's do... Do we have to go to Anor Londo now?
[159:19.87]Solo all the bosses with the friends watching.
[159:21.99]That's not going to happen.
[159:22.78]Let me go up here.
[159:36.98]I need the Lord Vessel.
[159:38.02]Yeah, that's true.
[159:38.94]Can I even get out of here?
[159:41.68]Can I leave this area?
[159:44.38]I'm not even sure I can leave.
[159:45.30]Oh, I'm dead.
[159:53.45]See ya.
[159:56.31]Bye.
[160:01.17]Ugh.
[160:08.98]Alright.
[160:10.40]Well, that was interesting.
[160:15.26]There's a ladder right there that I missed.
[160:24.93]No.
[160:25.51]Right.
[160:28.41]Don't die on the ladder, please.
[160:32.55]Stop drinking beer!
[160:33.51]I'm not drinking beer, I'm drinking... I'm drinking pomegranate juice.
[160:52.11]It's like they put them in a spot you just- you have to just punch- like, punch them.
[160:56.67]I- Dude, honestly, how, like, how hysterical is this?
[161:09.28]How funny is this?
[161:10.36]I'm getting more angry at Dark Souls after completing it and playing right now than I was when I actually played the game.
[161:25.44]How scary... Oh my god, how hilarious is that?
[161:32.17]The only part that I should be angry at, I already did.
[161:52.25]You're going through with a really bad weapon and a little bit of health.
[161:54.93]I know, and that's why I'm getting so much... Do I have pants on?
[161:58.57]No.
[162:00.82]Alright.
[162:01.78]Uh-huh.
[162:04.34]Fromp is not here yet.
[162:05.38]Okay.
[162:14.30]Last thing we're going to do... Is we're going to go... Where do I want to go?
[162:21.05]New Londo to...
[162:23.70]I don't think I can do anything with that.
[162:37.72]Blighttown, the Depths.
[162:39.67]Oh, that's going to be a lot of fun, isn't it?
[162:44.17]Now, we need to kill the Capra Demon.
[162:46.41]Capra Demon's still alive.
[162:49.33]Is there a... Am I going to do the actual PvP area?
[162:52.57]I can't.
[162:54.42]Because I completed the game, and I am in New Game Plus on the other characters, so... So I can't really do anything.
[163:06.61]Just skip the depths?
[163:08.09]Is it possible to do that?
[163:14.76]You don't need to kill Capra?
[163:15.90]So I guess I could go from here, up and down to...
[163:22.57]Well, I don't have the thing.
[163:24.18]I could get the thing to get Sif, right?
[163:29.60]I'm trying to think of where I could even go from here.
[163:31.82]That would make sense.
[163:34.58]Ugh.
[163:37.98]Do New Londo.
[163:38.74]Let's go down from Firelink.
[163:45.26]And just do Blighttown.
[163:47.02]Can you from here?
[163:48.62]Maybe go to New Londo?
[163:51.54]Oh, no, yeah, because you can go from New Londo.
[163:55.12]You can literally walk to the right.
[163:57.92]And then you can go out to where the valley is and then go to Blighttown through there.
[164:09.17]Okay, that's what we'll do.
[164:12.58]Let's just make it quick through Blighttown.
[164:16.67]And we'll see where we're at after that.
[164:17.99]I don't know if we'll keep going after that, because... I think I'm gonna... I'm gonna probably end the stream after we get through Flight Town.
[164:32.96]Just be Winnie the Pooh.
[164:37.25]Alright, new Londo, which takes us over here.
[164:46.00]Could kill Havel, too.
[164:47.97]Although, yeah, right, that ain't gonna happen.
[164:51.81]Alright.
[164:52.95]Now... I can just go over there.
[164:57.17]And that's... This is Blighttown.
[164:59.07]Alright, let's see those, uh... Let's see those summoning symbols.
[165:11.60]Not a good place to get it.
[165:12.60]Right over here, right?
[165:16.07]Alright, dial in.
[165:21.38]Call the 1-800 number on your screen right here.
[165:47.41]Oh, you gotta go past the bridge.
[165:48.67]Okay.
[165:55.28]Not even gonna deal with those guys right now.
[166:01.96]Fly down!
[166:06.34]Oh, fuck.
[166:08.67]Where are the signs?
[166:09.57]There's one.
[166:09.97]Okay, who are you?
[166:10.65]I don't even know.
[166:11.73]You're Smeag.
[166:12.93]He's got the... Okay, he's a puncher too.
[166:15.17]This is also a puncher.
[166:16.20]And he's going to summon and die from this guy.
[166:20.22]I hope I didn't just get him killed.
[166:21.90]And I walked by them.
[166:23.04]They weren't even summoned in yet.
[166:24.10]Hold on.
[166:27.46]He's in trouble.
[166:34.43]Paladin.
[166:34.75]Paladin.
[166:36.96]Well, that was good.
[166:37.58]You got him.
[166:38.64]Punchers only?
[166:39.04]I don't think there's any other punchers.
[166:42.82]That's a viable puncher build.
[166:44.20]And Scarlet... Scarlet Rain.
[166:49.01]What is that thing?
[166:51.29]Oh, that's from the Iron... The Iron Giant, right?
[166:53.35]You can pull one more person in, right?
[167:02.97]One, two, three...
[167:08.09]Potion seller.
[167:11.27]I remember that video.
[167:18.85]Any other punchers here?
[167:19.63]Oh, this person's wild looking.
[167:21.71]This guy looks like he's in the ocean.
[167:29.79]Well, we got an invader.
[167:31.99]I don't think he really knows yet.
[167:36.56]Oh, well.
[167:49.62]Don't let him wrap around.
[167:50.56]Alright, we're good.
[167:52.98]Get us through Blighttown.
[167:59.04]Keaton Uwando.
[168:00.25]What's he doing under there?
[168:01.07]He's doing weird laughing spells under here.
[168:04.63]Ow.
[168:07.33]Alright, you go first.
[168:13.78]Together we have to do this as a team.
[168:15.00]Maybe we all work as one unit.
[168:23.70]What?
[168:23.90]In the name of God?
[168:24.60]I thought that was the boss.
[168:26.18]I thought that was Quelaag.
[168:28.26]I thought I got hacked and I thought that Quelaag was in the game.
[168:41.25]Watch out.
[168:41.69]There's the invader right behind you.
[168:45.24]Oh.
[168:45.90]Um.
[168:48.36]We're good.
[168:51.08]Wait, somebody's... Who died?
[168:53.20]Who died?
[168:56.84]Got him.
[168:58.96]That's teamwork.
[169:00.46]That's how you do teamwork right there.
[169:06.42]We killed Dracula.
[169:07.40]Nice work, everybody.
[169:10.87]Remember, there's going to be all kinds of swindlers to try to get us from here.
[169:26.91]What the hell?
[169:29.07]How are you doing that?
[169:38.86]Where are you?
[169:39.50]What?
[169:44.61]What in the name of God just happened?
[170:02.10]Okay.
[170:08.92]Then all three of them were already down all the way to the ground.
[170:14.37]Okay.
[170:15.41]Well, that was... That was interesting.
[170:25.96]I think the invader wants you to play Wizard 101.
[170:31.44]Somebody invaded and I forgot about them?
[170:33.02]Well, that doesn't explain the fact that everybody started to disappear on me.
[170:36.86]Well, what have we here?
[170:44.77]You leave me with no choice.
[170:48.81]But if this is our fate, so be it.
[171:21.35]He's alive?
[171:21.93]Alright, give me all your stuff.
[171:32.46]Humanity, and that is Super Ring, and we're gonna put the Super Ring on right now.
[171:37.42]Just never take it off.
[171:43.00]She's alive, we're good.
[171:47.96]I didn't even let him out of the cage, though, did I?
[171:49.45]It's odd.
[171:51.07]Okay, well, back to, uh, let's go.
[171:56.91]Now I have to go off to do the whole thing again.
[171:58.81]Alright, guys, I need some real bodyguards here, because if that happens again, you know what's gonna happen.
[172:04.66]It's gonna be over.
[172:08.54]If I get, like, 56k'd down there again, it's gonna be a problem.
[172:20.25]Yeah, password is 777LUCKY.
[172:30.00]I have more... I can put something on, can't I?
[172:35.08]That should let me... No, I don't want to be mid-rolling.
[172:38.05]It's not going to be enough.
[172:41.61]There we go.
[172:42.21]Alright, I'm good.
[172:58.51]10 Estus.
[173:00.59]We gotta make going through Blighttown quick, because you see what happens.
[173:04.49]All it takes is some dude just to fall down and smash your head.
[173:15.41]Yeah, we're gonna go through Blighttown very quickly.
[173:28.93]Really?
[173:29.79]You just turned around on me like that.
[173:31.25]Come on.
[173:35.39]Alright, right here.
[173:37.45]Let's see those signs.
[173:39.83]Oh, fuck.
[173:40.21]Are they coming at me?
[173:42.20]They are.
[173:46.06]Oh my god, all three of them are coming.
[173:47.28]I need signs.
[173:47.90]They're backing off, right?
[173:53.86]One still.
[173:54.64]Oh, fuck.
[173:57.56]Why did they all... I hate this game.
[174:11.37]All three of them just started sprinting in a line again.
[174:13.89]Why?
[174:14.97]Why?
[174:17.65]And why did it take so long for the summoning signs to show up?
[174:26.16]Why?
[174:26.44]Like, I can't just... Come on, man!
[174:30.64]No, I gotta... I have to kill these guys.
[174:34.65]I just do.
[174:35.47]That's gonna happen every time.
[174:47.79]I have to get down there.
[174:48.73]So I'm gonna kill those guys.
[174:50.85]One at a time.
[174:51.39]We're gonna do it very carefully.
[174:53.72]So then I can summon people, so then I won't- that scenario cannot play out.
[175:02.33]Jesus Christ.
[175:26.00]Where's my Christmas... What are you talking about?
[175:28.06]Christmas cards?
[175:37.65]Somebody give me a Christmas card?
[175:39.71]Have one person with me at all times.
[175:41.91]Yeah, but I have to get... I have to open them.
[175:44.93]I have to open them out of the summoning box.
[175:47.77]So, I can't summon anybody here.
[175:49.95]Only the signs show up, like, after all the fat guys.
[175:53.13]So, I have to kill the fat guys.
[175:56.29]So one at a time.
[175:57.07]I'm just gonna kill the fat guys.
[175:59.31]Let's go.
[176:00.51]Get over here.
[176:00.89]I keep on dropping my jukes.
[176:29.71]Oh, come on!
[176:30.79]No, man!
[176:33.25]Why do you have to be like that?
[176:40.51]Come on, you're fat and slow.
[176:41.63]Just give it to me.
[176:44.12]What made me do this horrible build?
[176:47.00]You know, that's a great question.
[176:49.60]I just... I wanted to be punching boxing guy and... It sounded like a great idea at the time.
[176:58.82]But it's not.
[177:14.57]Come here.
[177:18.31]It is funny, though.
[177:19.63]Well, that's a good thing.
[177:20.45]Do you remember I was really happy at this time?
[177:29.15]Because I thought I was going to be like, oh, punching man.
[177:30.67]This is going to be so much fun.
[177:43.01]Okay, that's two down.
[177:44.37]One more to go.
[177:46.95]And then I get to play with my best friends.
[178:04.18]Punching Man only works in Dark Souls 2.
[178:05.70]Yeah, but it was... It's, you know, a lesson learned.
[178:20.04]Okay, now we can just hang out here.
[178:29.86]Alright, let me see those signs.
[178:31.51]Let's get some people in here.
[178:34.93]Lesson learned, keep on going.
[178:36.37]Yeah, well, at this point, that's what I'm doing.
[178:38.53]And it's already plus five.
[178:39.85]I don't know if I can just turn something into plus five right now, immediately.
[178:43.85]But my brain is just stuck on this.
[178:47.46]Let's see those.
[178:48.10]There they are.
[178:48.50]Okay.
[178:50.22]Let's get some new faces here.
[178:52.26]One that we haven't seen before.
[178:54.06]Gray Fox has not been in the game yet, so let's bring him in.
[178:57.44]This guy's very interesting looking.
[179:01.98]This guy's really cool looking, actually.
[179:09.26]My characters always look like shit.
[179:12.53]Why can't I look this cool with an axe?
[179:15.75]This is Bweep.
[179:17.67]Bweep.
[179:26.39]Alright.
[179:27.69]This last one.
[179:28.17]This looks like patches.
[179:29.13]Probably shouldn't trust this guy.
[179:36.22]Kanye West was already in the game.
[179:38.12]Doinkus.
[179:40.14]Well, that was a coin.
[179:40.88]Thanks for the coin.
[179:42.42]That's Giant Dad without the giant part.
[179:44.36]How are they both getting in at the same time?
[179:52.73]We got...
[179:55.92]I don't care who it is.
[179:58.36]We got a Katarina Knight.
[180:05.62]Nice.
[180:05.96]Good work, Gray Fox.
[180:08.94]Stay together, though.
[180:10.00]Don't just go running out there.
[180:12.68]This guy's sprinting at me.
[180:13.56]Should I be concerned?
[180:14.26]Huh.
[180:26.25]Is he alive?
[180:33.45]Don't let him get away.
[180:34.31]He's tricky.
[180:35.11]He's very tricky.
[180:43.63]How many fucking times do I have to do that?
[180:47.04]Alright, we're safe.
[180:50.48]We're safe.
[180:51.38]We've done it.
[180:52.74]Let's keep going.
[180:56.17]Wait, did the other guy die?
[180:57.31]I don't remember seeing him die.
[181:00.28]Is that guy still here?
[181:08.56]I heard some- I just heard someone.
[181:14.06]Just make it quick.
[181:16.20]We need to get out of here.
[181:17.10]There's two people here now.
[181:21.96]Thank you.
[181:25.72]We can't, we can't stand.
[181:26.64]We gotta move.
[181:33.12]Good work.
[181:39.70]He's down.
[181:40.14]How'd that guy, did that guy fall off?
[181:42.85]I think he fell off the edge.
[181:47.89]Get us down here.
[181:52.48]Remember, I need a big guy in front of me and a big guy behind me to block the toxic.
[182:09.15]Are we waiting for everybody to get down?
[182:11.18]There he is.
[182:11.62]I see him.
[182:16.88]What are we waiting for here?
[182:20.08]He missed it.
[182:22.73]That guy's dead.
[182:23.99]Wait, why is he falling?
[182:25.13]Why are people falling?
[182:28.41]What the hell is going on?
[182:40.79]Alright, we're good.
[182:42.89]We made it to the end of Blighttown.
[182:48.55]His body just... Did he...
[182:53.60]Okay, well, we need some new signs here.
[182:55.53]We're going to need one more sign.
[183:01.49]Oh, my head.
[183:04.71]It's always an adventure getting to the bottom.
[183:08.27]Get the bonfire here.
[183:09.27]Yeah, we'll say goodbye and we'll call people back.
[183:16.38]You bet your ass that we're going to do the tree, by the way.
[183:20.41]We're gonna kill Quelaag, and then we're gonna do the tree.
[183:22.51]And I'm just in poison.
[183:23.83]Now this is the NPC that invades you.
[183:26.96]Alright, we gotta get her.
[183:40.17]We can't lose a friend right now.
[183:49.83]Nice job.
[183:54.81]Let's just go kill Quelaag right now.
[183:58.17]Follow me.
[183:59.81]What is going on with the game?
[184:11.24]What is going on up there?
[184:20.17]What the fuck?
[184:22.59]Okay, let's get out of here.
[184:28.70]Yeah, it's time to leave.
[184:30.04]It's time to get to the boss door right now.
[184:34.70]The Eye of Saharan is currently looking at us.
[184:40.96]That was right in the fucking face.
[184:46.69]Magic.
[184:47.77]Miraculous that I didn't get hit by that.
[184:51.07]Alright, and he's waiting for us at the boss door, so just be aware of that.
[184:54.01]He's gonna do something crazy.
[184:57.82]He's right at the boss door.
[185:01.98]Easy, guys.
[185:05.84]Guys, careful!
[185:06.56]Careful, Duper!
[185:07.34]Duper!
[185:08.84]No!
[185:09.40]Are you ser- Oh my fucking god.
[185:18.45]Did I actually just die in one hit?
[185:23.72]I didn't even get the bonfire.
[185:33.07]That did 100% of my damage.
[185:49.17]Oh god, that sucks.
[185:50.87]I'm just gonna run to the bonfire.
[185:52.19]I'm staying dead.
[185:54.69]I'm just getting to the- ugh.
[185:56.33]I'm so def- I'm so deflated right now.
[185:58.41]It's empty.
[186:03.22]All the air is gone.
[186:13.46]If I don't get down there first try, I think that might be the end.
[186:23.58]Oh, how sad.
[186:37.29]Oh, no.
[186:37.73]I've got to go all the way over.
[186:39.71]Well, it doesn't matter because I don't have to summon anybody.
[186:41.57]I'm just going right down.
[186:49.56]Try to just get to the bonfire as fast as I can and then summon again.
[186:57.98]Why?
[186:58.26]I jumped.
[186:59.78]The jump doesn't have the... Ah, never mind.
[187:02.28]Just go.
[187:03.82]Why didn't I get the bonfire?
[187:04.81]Because I couldn't.
[187:05.89]Because there were people in the game.
[187:07.09]I had to get rid of them.
[187:09.51]And before getting rid of them, I had, you know, people got invaded.
[187:13.65]And it was kind of just like, oh shit, people are invading.
[187:18.13]I didn't have time to press the button.
[187:23.59]By the way, just in case anybody is curious, yes, in fact, I do not know where the fuck I'm going.
[187:28.61]I have no idea.
[187:30.09]I'm just trying to do this off of muscle memory.
[187:33.45]I think I got it.
[187:50.02]Oh, god damn it.
[187:52.94]Where is the thing?
[187:54.00]Where is it?
[187:55.74]Where is it?
[187:56.12]Right down there.
[187:56.64]Okay, I'm good.
[188:04.30]Is this correct?
[188:06.13]I don't think this is correct.
[188:09.83]This is correct, right?
[188:10.61]Yeah.
[188:10.81]Okay, we're good.
[188:20.54]Alright, down to the bonfire.
[188:26.13]Is it saved?
[188:26.87]I think it's saved.
[188:29.21]Alright, stream stays on.
[188:34.80]Alright, where's that bonfire?
[188:35.76]It's over here, right?
[188:36.40]I don't even have the ring to be able to go through this fast.
[188:39.68]I'm toxic and poisoned.
[188:47.18]Isn't it back here?
[188:52.25]Maybe not saved.
[188:57.73]Where is it?
[188:58.35]It's like back here.
[189:01.35]It's right there.
[189:02.57]Alright, we're good.
[189:04.37]Just touch the damn thing.
[189:05.63]Alright.
[189:11.52]Stream has been saved.
[189:23.70]Put your steins down here.
[189:29.17]Make up your mind.
[189:31.53]Saved, man.
[189:32.21]Alright, let's go.
[189:36.42]Uh, Frank Reynolds.
[189:37.14]No, no, no.
[189:37.50]Let's find somebody that hasn't been in here yet.
[189:40.90]I mean, you have to always be here.
[189:45.96]777lucky is the password.
[189:46.90]All lowercase.
[189:48.42]Even if, I'm not sure it matters, but if it does, it does.
[189:50.66]I think that's Gray Fox.
[189:59.55]Move back here.
[190:01.75]Pepperoni's been in the game.
[190:04.14]What does this guy have for a weapon?
[190:07.02]Alright, your weapon is insane, so I want to see what it is.
[190:12.62]Lowercase numbers.
[190:22.74]It's the onion guy.
[190:23.68]Have we seen you?
[190:28.66]Had you before... Alright, this is Ti- Ti- Who's the 1997 person?
[190:33.36]Where are they?
[190:36.08]Okay, I don't- Team speak in 1997, sure thing.
[190:39.15]Alright, we got it.
[190:40.59]Let's go beat Quelaag.
[190:51.62]That thing is awesome.
[190:52.78]How do you get that?
[190:56.50]That weapon is so cool.
[190:58.54]Alright, we gotta go.
[191:01.10]We don't have time.
[191:02.12]We gotta go to Quelaag right now.
[191:05.26]Invasion is happening and I think this is the guy that one hit kills you.
[191:10.78]So, let's go.
[191:22.00]He's back there.
[191:22.60]Alright, he's behind us.
[191:23.58]We're good.
[191:24.58]Just keep him behind us.
[191:30.98]I don't even know where he threw that to, but good thing it wasn't at me.
[191:36.72]There he is.
[191:37.20]He's running.
[191:38.42]Get away from him.
[191:48.58]Here comes the rock.
[191:52.34]Alright, let me get rid of this poison real quick.
[191:55.46]I don't think I've, I've never, did I pick anything up?
[191:58.44]Yes, okay, we're good.
[192:01.40]Alright, knife pervert's in here now.
[192:02.48]What the fuck is he doing in here?
[192:06.32]What is going on?
[192:07.05]Okay, go, get out, out, out, out, out, out.
[192:15.31]Hurry, hurry!
[192:17.55]Hurry before he gets here!
[192:19.83]Hurry!
[192:21.37]Oh boy!
[192:22.07]I did it.
[192:22.61]Okay.
[192:23.03]Hopefully they got in too.
[192:23.83]Alright, this one, I don't care.
[192:34.66]You guys can just fight it.
[192:38.22]Just kill it.
[192:38.76]Just get rid of it.
[192:39.22]Because then we're going to go to the Great Hollow.
[192:46.94]Come on in.
[192:50.08]One, two, three.
[192:53.08]Kill.
[193:05.75]This is so... This character is so... Is so bad.
[193:10.89]I think I need to just throw this in the garbage can.
[193:28.15]Oh jeez, she killed everybody!
[193:30.41]Oh no!
[193:32.83]Hold on.
[193:33.69]Oh no.
[193:35.41]She got them all.
[193:42.12]You can do it!
[193:43.44]My one true bodyguard!
[193:46.54]I believe in you.
[193:53.25]Faturu is here forever.
[193:55.21]With four person scaling.
[193:56.53]We're good.
[194:09.14]Easy.
[194:15.50]26 damage.
[194:18.12]I might as well just sing to the theme song.
[194:24.96]Explosion.
[194:32.73]Disasters are gone after the defeat of... What the hell?
[194:37.27]What are they talking about?
[194:43.13]Did somebody kill somebody in the game?
[194:46.36]That I didn't see.
[194:54.12]Make her focus on me so the real player can do it.
[194:56.32]As long as I get the last hit, it doesn't matter.
[194:59.02]I didn't even get it.
[195:02.86]Thank you!
[195:03.78]Thank you for making me not hate this build.
[195:07.34]You did it.
[195:07.84]You're a very good friend.
[195:14.11]Hey, Cairo Toby, thank you for the 50 bucks.
[195:17.33]And they say, come on, Faye.
[195:20.55]Thank you.
[195:22.44]Thank you, Cairo Toby.
[195:24.64]Faye is really, really doing work here.
[195:29.24]Okay.
[195:32.40]But, Cairo Toby, thanks a lot, man.
[195:35.87]Big money.
[195:39.93]Yeah, yes, Faye has saved me more than once.
[195:41.89]More than twice.
[195:45.52]Where does FaZe stream?
[195:46.62]I want to watch him.
[195:47.44]Not this casual.
[195:50.18]Well, come on.
[195:52.30]You gotta give me some slack.
[195:55.77]I'm unarmed asshole.
[195:58.47]What else can I have?
[195:59.33]Might as well.
[195:59.93]I'm just gonna start shooting crossbows.
[196:03.39]What do you need?
[196:04.09]Ten and eight?
[196:05.19]Scales with nothing.
[196:07.25]Doesn't scale with anything.
[196:18.56]Do I have any bolts?
[196:21.98]No, I don't have anything.
[196:22.70]I'm not supposed to do double crossbow from here on out.
[196:31.22]Alright.
[196:33.98]I need to... We need to go to the tree, but first.
[196:38.51]Hold on.
[196:42.59]Right, this is down to get to the demon ruins.
[196:44.43]I don't want to do that.
[196:46.49]Ring the bell?
[196:46.91]I just did.
[196:52.71]Bell has been rung.
[196:56.09]Well, you can't do the tree.
[196:57.05]Why not?
[197:01.30]Watch with binoculars while people kill the boss for you.
[197:11.41]You can't summon in the tree.
[197:17.83]You know what?
[197:18.51]I like that idea.
[197:19.29]I'm doing it.
[197:20.03]Where are the binoculars?
[197:30.94]There are no bosses at the tree, so I can't do it.
[197:34.12]Oh, that sucks.
[197:35.04]Really?
[197:42.22]Hey.
[197:44.30]Where's the lady that's in the wall?
[197:52.43]Am I crazy?
[197:53.85]Where's the spider lady?
[197:59.99]Wasn't she in here?
[198:06.10]She's like down... Where's the ball in the... No, I'm not going back to Annalando.
[198:11.19]Actually, this might be it.
[198:12.31]Here.
[198:14.85]This is probably it.
[198:16.01]The it.
[198:16.99]I can't... I am not gonna lose to a fucking worm that has infinite stamina.
[198:34.55]Why is it not equipped?
[198:35.69]Why is it off my fucking bar?
[198:37.10]Yeah, is she down here?
[198:51.70]Like straight ahead, right?
[198:54.00]Yeah, the real boss was the worm that I can't hurt.
[198:56.18]Because I didn't have the stupid thing on my bar.
[199:02.75]So I want somebody to kill the worm.
[199:10.68]Okay, yeah, it's down here.
[199:19.07]Isn't it like right here somewhere?
[199:23.03]Where is it?
[199:23.55]Where are you?
[199:24.03]There you are.
[199:25.93]No.
[199:27.85]There it is.
[199:35.26]Hi, how are you?
[199:35.90]I'd like to talk.
[199:36.52]Yes, of course.
[199:56.50]And how are you?
[200:28.61]Well, I never saw that before.
[200:29.89]Okay.
[200:30.03]Okay.
[200:41.04]Got some eggs.
[200:42.08]Oh, God.
[200:42.42]His afterlife is killing me.
[200:43.72]I can't light this anymore.
[200:44.60]Alright.
[200:46.78]Give me help.
[200:49.30]Bring on the worms.
[200:50.88]There's nothing back here, right?
[200:52.02]Nope.
[200:56.95]I'm laughing at his grief?
[200:59.65]No, I just wanted to see what happened when you did it!
[201:02.30]So now I have to go... back to...
[201:09.18]Firelink?
[201:10.34]No, that's... If I can't do the tree, I wouldn't really... You know what?
[201:15.20]Fuck it.
[201:15.42]Let's do demon runes.
[201:16.44]Let's just do it.
[201:18.18]Whatever happens, happens.
[201:18.96]If we lose, we lose.
[201:22.88]We're going here.
[201:28.10]Put your signs down here.
[201:38.19]You want the super cheese, Ceaseless?
[201:39.89]I feel like I ate his cheese last time.
[201:47.41]Alright.
[201:50.68]Demon runes!
[201:51.62]Let's see those signs.
[201:58.22]I wonder how we'll fare against all the Taurus demons.
[202:00.32]I don't know, that's true.
[202:10.68]Would I have to have the Lord Vessel to summon people here?
[202:16.04]Go do Ornstein with five people.
[202:17.46]I feel like that's going to take us a while to get there.
[202:21.05]No one wants to help me.
[202:23.07]It's because I'm a bad person.
[202:26.91]No, I rang the bell.
[202:28.23]I pulled the thing.
[202:36.84]I can't.
[202:37.14]You have to go through the fog wall.
[202:38.32]I can't summon here.
[202:39.16]Okay.
[202:41.95]Okay.
[202:45.81]Oh, there we go.
[202:46.57]Alright.
[202:48.67]Grey fox.
[202:56.26]Now I rang the bell.
[202:59.50]Who else is here?
[203:02.88]This person we've never seen before.
[203:04.26]Cop.
[203:06.50]Cop and...
[203:21.72]Bodyblock, bodyblock, bodyblock, bodyblock him, bodyblock!
[203:24.50]Bodyblock this guy!
[203:26.68]Alright, bodyblock.
[203:28.84]Oh, he's got waves.
[203:36.29]Ah, get a backstab!
[203:37.75]Get a- Not you!
[203:40.62]The other guy!
[203:41.52]Oh my fucking god!
[203:56.24]Yeah, he got a backstab, alright.
[204:00.75]Alright, I got the last hit.
[204:02.99]10 points.
[204:09.33]Okay, nobody else?
[204:14.48]Alright, come on down.
[204:15.70]Let's go beat this boss and then probably call it a night.
[204:30.99]Plus 10 points to Gryffindor.
[204:35.23]Waluigi has gone home.
[204:36.63]Oh wait, there was another invasion?
[204:39.17]I guess there was.
[204:39.71]Alright, wake him up.
[204:56.99]There he is.
[204:59.55]Hello.
[205:01.42]You can throw it that far?
[205:02.42]I was gonna say, no way.
[205:03.80]Alright, wake him up.
[205:14.32]Alright, boys and girls.
[205:17.16]Take him on.
[205:18.36]I will watch from afar.
[205:19.42]Oh, well, you're dead.
[205:21.52]You're all dead.
[205:22.54]You're both dead.
[205:24.34]All I have is you.
[205:36.37]I gotta go back further.
[205:38.01]Back here.
[205:40.77]Alright, get him!
[205:41.33]No, you don't have to be on camera.
[205:46.17]You don't have to be on camera.
[205:47.45]Just go.
[205:48.23]Where are you going?
[205:49.59]What are you doing?
[205:55.35]Alright, I gotta watch you again.
[206:06.16]Why are we going back here?
[206:11.17]He's like, yeah, you see me?
[206:12.47]I didn't fucking die.
[206:16.89]Why are we doing this?
[206:20.55]Should I be watching him?
[206:24.07]This is the cheese strat.
[206:28.63]Let's watch.
[206:42.64]He's gonna fall.
[206:43.78]He's gonna fall.
[206:45.22]What are we doing here?
[206:55.79]I don't know what the strategy he's doing here is.
[207:02.62]He's gonna beat him.
[207:04.22]He's dead.
[207:05.16]Alright, well apparently your strategy didn't work.
[207:14.38]Do I have to do everything myself?
[207:21.99]Oh, fuck.
[207:25.98]Oh, fuck.
[207:26.56]No!
[207:45.81]I'm okay with that.
[207:49.59]It only works without armor?
[207:50.85]What do you actually do?
[207:53.79]Everybody died so quickly.
[208:00.16]No, let's do it.
[208:02.50]Let's do it again.
[208:08.29]Last attempt.
[208:21.49]Alright, come on down.
[208:30.28]Alright, I'm moving.
[208:33.34]I'm going.
[208:34.42]Back to the bridge.
[208:40.01]Where are they at?
[208:40.81]Summoning signs.
[208:41.61]We need them.
[208:45.33]Is this the first time you've ever seen somebody wear the marshmallow gloves?
[208:57.47]There we go.
[208:59.03]Uh, we need... Let me see if I can do... Can I get three giant dads in here?
[209:03.81]God fucking dammit.
[209:08.51]No, don't even.
[209:12.16]He's dropping stuff.
[209:13.08]I'm not picking anything up.
[209:20.78]This guy gets another attempt.
[209:21.76]Okay.
[209:28.87]Okay, this is like, we get giant dad and then giant dad's son.
[209:32.14]Like, small dad.
[209:36.84]Really, it's just the mask you have on is all that matters.
[209:39.14]Alright.
[209:52.15]I hope they're all in a row here.
[210:03.23]So many different kinds of characters.
[210:04.65]I love it.
[210:07.73]Okay.
[210:07.99]There we go.
[210:10.83]Watch out.
[210:12.40]Easy, easy.
[210:16.50]I don't even need to help him.
[210:20.44]He can just do this all on his own.
[210:21.60]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh.
[210:25.98]Easy.
[210:26.12]Easy.
[210:32.02]I almost just walked off the edge.
[210:33.00]Alright, that's double Giant Dad in there.
[210:37.56]The best tag team you could have.
[210:40.66]Good luck.
[210:41.04]Alright, where's the other one?
[210:43.88]Alright, this is like Giant Dad with a spear.
[210:56.86]That's Giant Dad with a dress.
[210:59.72]I love how everyone's putting on the mask.
[211:07.81]Come on.
[211:08.19]There's gotta be one more of you.
[211:11.35]Yeah, fine.
[211:12.71]Ringing the guy with the funny held.
[211:15.90]Everyone's putting the dad mask on to get, like, into the game.
[211:19.78]Alright, come on.
[211:20.24]Let's go, dads.
[211:25.78]Alright.
[211:30.44]Alright.
[211:33.60]Waluigi has come into the game.
[211:36.12]Easy.
[211:38.44]Here he comes.
[211:39.76]Alright, you guys gotta take care of these two perverts.
[211:45.04]Two naked guys make me proud.
[211:46.76]Come on.
[211:56.36]Okay, well he's gone.
[211:57.42]That was easy enough.
[212:07.18]Get him!
[212:10.74]What are you so fr- Okay, well that's- Alright, let's go.
[212:18.52]Into the chamber, let's do it.
[212:29.85]And this is all you, by the way, guys.
[212:32.15]I'm gonna follow- By the way, the two dads are gonna be the ones we follow.
[212:37.63]I gotta get the camera on the two dads and Beehive Head is here for support.
[212:44.71]You know what to do, guys.
[212:56.88]Got my souls.
[213:04.38]You have to get the armor and then run back.
[213:06.29]I don't have any of that armor.
[213:12.73]Alright, let me get a good place to watch.
[213:16.64]I'm thinking back here is going to be fine.
[213:19.72]No, I'm going to follow the giant dads.
[213:34.14]Oh, okay, alright, alright, hold on.
[213:46.52]Alright, I'm in it.
[213:47.20]What do I do?
[213:48.34]Oh, shit!
[213:49.92]We're good.
[213:50.28]Go, go, go.
[213:56.94]Do I need to be in this?
[214:01.52]Oh, no.
[214:06.43]He's stuck back there.
[214:07.06]Alright, I'm ready.
[214:09.88]Now where do we go?
[214:13.22]Where do we go from here?
[214:16.80]I don't understand what I'm doing this for.
[214:18.82]Why am I like the sheep?
[214:34.44]I think we might have just lost a few people.
[214:36.92]Did one giant dad go down?
[214:37.98]Okay, back to the fog gate and wait here.
[214:58.37]Oh, he's not gonna make it!
[215:03.67]No, we all made it!
[215:04.49]Okay, all of us made it.
[215:10.69]What is supposed to happen here?
[215:29.67]Oh, that's what happens.
[215:34.18]Thanks for playing, guys.
[215:37.44]What a view.
[215:37.96]So I didn't have to put this on.
[215:46.01]Alright, well, that was cool.
[215:50.99]Gorgeous view ahead.
[215:51.97]Yeah, why is there a fog gate here?
[216:02.98]Well, can I jump down from here?
[216:14.24]Oh, the fog is gone.
[216:15.58]That's weird.
[216:20.89]Yes, this is the final Dark Souls stream.
[216:23.17]I just wanted to play some multiplayer, do a little PvP, and be done with it.
[216:27.35]Close it out.
[216:32.42]I wanted to experience all the things I could.
[216:36.68]And there's an item here.
[216:39.24]He just put shit on the ground.
[216:40.54]Alright.
[216:40.80]Alright, and that is probably going to be it.
[216:47.23]I think we've had our fun.
[216:51.23]We've had our share of interesting things.
[216:58.21]So, that is the end of Dark Souls 1.
[217:03.22]The last thing I'm going to do is I'm going to summon... Where can I summon people now?
[217:15.24]Where's the spot I can summon people?
[217:16.58]Because I want to just summon like five dark phantoms and have them fight one more time.
[217:28.39]Have to go to Sen's Fortress.
[217:30.39]Alright, we'll go to Sen's.
[217:31.49]I'll put the marker down.
[217:32.93]And... No, okay, this is what we're going to do.
[217:34.95]This is the final thing.
[217:36.47]We're going to go to Sen's Fortress.
[217:38.55]And I'm going to summon as many red phantoms as I can.
[217:42.49]And then from there... We are going to try to get through... Just run through Sen's Fortress.
[217:49.49]One try.
[217:50.47]And you have to be running.
[217:55.07]Is there anything else I can do here?
[217:57.78]I don't think so.
[218:03.60]Become an egg.
[218:05.16]No eggs.
[218:07.93]So now I have to go through here.
[218:11.81]I'm trying to think of how to get back to go up around.
[218:26.67]This is where I need to remember again, it's the... You go up... Through the... Um... The... Water wheel, whatever the hell it is, right?
[218:41.54]Oh, fuck, you don't have the thing...
[218:58.47]I don't have the thing.
[218:59.61]Yeah, I gotta go this way.
[219:01.92]Is he playing PvP?
[219:08.98]Uh, this is PvP.
[219:10.05]PvP and multiplayer.
[219:12.51]Just kind of messing around in multiplayer.
[219:28.44]And let me actually... I'm going to get this on the bar because I know it'll be a problem eventually here.
[219:38.50]I just know it will, so... Alright, now from here I've got to go up.
[219:52.89]Up, up, up.
[219:54.35]Up, up, up.
[219:56.92]And then we go to Sen's Fortress and end it there.
[220:05.67]Should be fun.
[220:06.31]That's where we'll close it up.
[220:17.29]See how many people can... Red Phantoms only.
[220:20.55]Pull them all in.
[220:25.42]No, I gotta keep going up.
[220:28.27]Right?
[220:28.69]Keep going up.
[220:44.88]That's how you go to get the... the soul, but I don't even really want it.
[220:49.84]I don't really think it's necessary at the moment.
[220:55.01]Why are my feet yellow?
[220:55.89]Because the whole character is yellow.
[221:08.12]Up one more, right?
[221:15.65]Again?
[221:22.98]Uh-huh.
[221:24.70]And we're out.
[221:27.56]Well, not yet.
[221:29.52]A couple of fat guys have run around.
[221:31.12]So don't do something stupid.
[221:42.79]And goodbye.
[221:48.95]You know what's funny?
[221:49.63]I saw a clip.
[221:50.81]Somebody put a clip up.
[221:52.86]I don't know if it was on like, I forget what subreddit it was on.
[221:55.44]I think it was on like the livestream fail subreddit.
[221:59.34]And somebody put like a clip of me dying or something.
[222:02.29]And the thing that they said is they go, well, man, that boss sucks.
[222:06.93]And somebody replied, one of you joking little jokers said, no, man, you have no idea.
[222:12.51]This dude fucking had full havels on with a plus 15 weapon and died to pinwheel.
[222:17.45]And the guy was like, holy shit, that's impressive.
[222:22.69]Like, I knew you guys were gonna do this shit, and you're gonna make me look so bad!
[222:25.39]It was one of you little jokers.
[222:37.83]Alright.
[222:45.24]Sen's Fortress.
[222:48.30]Let's go to Firelink, and then around the corner, down...
[222:54.79]We gotta go back this way.
[222:56.41]Kind of a pain in the ass, but you know.
[223:02.18]That's just the way it is right now.
[223:08.36]And then from here we go... I out here.
[223:15.84]Up the elevator, right?
[223:19.28]Back to Undead Parish.
[223:22.88]And then out the door.
[223:29.65]Look, he's remembering.
[223:30.71]He's remembering things.
[223:40.41]It's okay to be embarrassed after dying to Tindra.
[223:44.09]Yeah, which I didn't do.
[223:47.36]You can say it as much as you want, that doesn't make it true.
[224:00.27]Alright, get your summoning signs down.
[224:02.77]Sense Fortress.
[224:03.37]Make sure it's red.
[224:04.11]Because we're just all red.
[224:06.67]No friends.
[224:08.99]Just make sure you play along.
[224:22.71]No more levels up.
[224:25.22]And the weapons don't matter.
[224:26.42]Because we're just going right in here.
[224:36.16]Hey, look, it's my favorite area in the game.
[224:38.86]We get to experience my favorite zone in Dark Souls 1.
[224:41.78]Alright, let's see.
[224:49.61]Who are we gonna bring in?
[224:51.67]Uh, swear word Baggins?
[224:53.89]Oh my fucking god, I didn't know you guys were gonna be here.
[225:01.68]Oh my fucking god, dude, really?
[225:19.21]Can Andre like fight with me or something?
[225:23.87]I'm known as a Dark Souls streamer by Kotaku.
[225:28.08]Well, I'll be fair.
[225:29.48]The last like two weeks of streams have been Dark Souls.
[225:56.69]Come on, just one.
[225:57.57]One of you.
[225:58.03]One.
[225:58.19]Just you.
[225:59.01]Just you.
[226:02.27]Oh, you slow-ass movements.
[226:05.19]I'm gonna use all my Estus here.
[226:36.82]It's just not fair.
[226:38.28]I need to put on a different item.
[226:41.39]Yeah, I'm throwing these in the fucking trash can.
[226:47.71]Parrying and front stabbing the guy like three times.
[226:52.19]Oh my lord.
[226:53.26]I don't even care what it is.
[226:57.70]This fucking thing.
[226:58.40]Let's go level it up three times.
[227:15.30]Just upgrade this, like, twice, please.
[227:17.04]Do I not have enough of anything?
[227:20.98]I need to buy this shit from you.
[227:22.42]Mother... Just do it again.
[227:33.84]Hold on, hold on.
[227:34.58]Wait a minute, guys.
[227:35.22]I'm gonna get this started.
[227:36.12]Hold on.
[227:41.64]Oh, Xbox.
[227:43.76]Record that.

[227:53.99]Where's the jester?
[227:58.43]What do I need, like five?
[228:08.25]One more.
[228:14.45]Okay.
[228:15.49]I'm ready.
[228:17.52]Let's go.
[228:25.53]Sit here, reverse the hollowing, and I'm gonna kindle the bonfire, and we can play the game!
[228:33.41]We can get rid of this... this gaudy setup that I thought was gonna be cool.
[228:51.16]And put on the target shield so I can do super parries.
[228:54.26]Do I even have it?
[228:55.90]I don't even have it.
[228:58.26]Put on the Black Knight shield.
[228:59.36]Let's go in, like, try-hard mode.
[229:04.94]Alright, let's do it.
[229:10.36]What's the spam going on here?
[229:12.36]All the kids at school bully me for watching Jerma.
[229:14.82]They said he couldn't beat Pinwheel without dying.
[229:17.22]But I said he could.
[229:17.98]I was wrong.
[229:18.62]And now Johnny is going to give me a swirly tomorrow.
[229:20.62]Why couldn't you just beat Pinwheel?
[229:35.61]that's whatever alright get yourself get your get your red signs down looking for red signs there they are alright okay um your first and last name I hope that's not your real name god you dick
[230:07.13]I'll fucking die again.
[230:09.65]Like, just get over here so you can fight these guys with me.
[230:17.42]We're in the same situation we were just in.
[230:23.30]Please come over here and backstab these guys.
[230:27.46]Because now we're stuck on the fucking bridge again.
[230:43.19]God damn it.
[230:43.75]Summoning fucking failed.
[231:06.09]Alright.
[231:07.39]Thank you!
[231:07.89]Let's go!
[231:12.97]Not a great pick for second weapon.
[231:15.89]It doesn't matter.
[231:16.61]I just... We're fine.
[231:18.89]So let's get back here.
[231:20.13]Summon again.
[231:20.65]Hi, guys.
[231:24.58]As many people as I can.
[231:30.88]What's going to happen next stream?
[231:31.82]We're going to start destroy all humans too.
[231:37.56]It would be fun here.
[231:40.78]We've been in pretty much everything.
[231:44.86]I have to have one of you.
[231:52.79]You know, actually, the bigger the person is, the funnier it probably will be.
[232:02.08]We're going to get five people.
[232:05.22]BigBrainGamer, you are very, very interesting.
[232:11.56]An interesting outfit.
[232:13.12]Kind of like a Gandalf situation there.
[232:14.78]Uh, we should probably bring Treasure Head here.
[232:20.02]Alright, well, there's already another person, so I don't have to summon.
[232:26.52]Uh, Frank Reynolds can come in.
[232:27.58]So, one, two, three, four.
[232:32.52]We need one more, right?
[232:37.03]Hello?
[232:38.97]Hello?
[232:43.43]Uh, maybe... You've been in a couple times.
[232:49.63]Big brain... Isn't the person already... Alright, how about Dexter?
[232:54.77]One, two, three, four, five.
[232:56.71]One more.
[233:01.23]Actually, I think that is it.
[233:02.67]No?
[233:04.11]Coming?
[233:06.67]Are you coming?
[233:09.75]Uh, I guess he's not coming.
[233:13.39]Oh, there he is.
[233:15.73]And a Goro.
[233:17.95]Alright, this is the final few.
[233:21.11]So remember, the goal here is we have to get through Sen's Fortress in one go.
[233:25.53]In one attempt.
[233:27.96]Try not to hurt each other.
[233:30.52]Try to behave.
[233:35.20]Good luck.
[233:41.44]By the way, I want to make sure that we're very clear about this, that this... Wait, wait, hold on.
[233:45.02]Nobody go anywhere.
[233:46.39]Everybody start back here.
[233:48.41]Mr. Dragon Man.
[233:53.81]This is a race to the end.
[233:58.36]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[233:59.36]I didn't say go.
[234:00.02]I didn't say go.
[234:00.88]Hold on.
[234:02.38]We have to start at the same place.
[234:08.00]We got to all start at the same place.
[234:11.47]Alright, we'll come to you.
[234:14.03]Alright, you guys ready?
[234:15.41]Race to the end.
[234:17.57]In three, two, one, go.
[234:21.05]One, two, three.
[234:27.55]I had to count to three seconds.
[234:29.81]Race to the end.
[234:38.34]Hey!
[234:38.74]Hey!
[234:39.36]That's cheating!
[234:41.87]He cheated.
[234:42.41]That was cheating.
[234:43.94]Unbelievable.
[234:44.96]Un-fucking-believable.
[234:45.94]He got hit.
[234:46.72]He got hit so he fucking freaked out and he hit everybody.
[234:49.38]Cheating.
[234:50.02]Absolutely disgraceful behavior.
[234:52.34]Red card.
[234:52.86]He's out.
[234:58.49]Absolutely.
[234:58.87]What a disgrace.
[235:00.37]That was disgraceful.
[235:05.15]You can still catch up.
[235:06.45]No, I can't.
[235:07.24]Oh, god damn it.
[235:14.74]You'll never work in this town again.
[235:16.98]Oh, come on.
[235:18.64]We had a good thing going there.
[235:20.00]Alright, we're gonna do it again.
[235:27.77]We have to get... I refuse... That's not how it ends.
[235:31.55]That's not how it ends.
[235:33.11]Sorry.
[235:44.92]I should just watch.
[235:47.08]Is there, okay, is there a spot that I can get to in Sens where I can just use the binoculars and watch them do it?
[235:55.97]Yeah, you gotta take off all your weapons.
[236:17.32]Uh, yeah, I probably can, uh... God damn it, he's still alive!
[236:25.97]Alright, okay.
[236:34.26]Is he coming down?
[236:34.88]Yes, he is.
[236:41.60]Surprising, I thought I got it.
[236:58.44]alright so is there a way I can go or stand remember you have to take off all your items besides uh you can wear armor that's it
[237:16.16]If you summon only Red Phantoms, they can't hit the enemies.
[237:20.55]Good luck.
[237:22.59]Let's bring Pepperoni in too.
[237:35.65]I want to try to get to an area where I can look.
[237:39.86]I probably won't be able to do it.
[237:43.30]The enemies won't hit them.
[237:46.07]I wish I could just, like, teleport somewhere.
[237:57.27]If they can't hit the enemies, you're gonna be the one who dies.
[237:59.35]Alright, well then, let's... Alright, so we got three, uh... We need some regular phantoms, then.
[238:05.52]Unfortunately.
[238:09.48]And in actuality, we should have just done it with only no red phantoms.
[238:14.40]But, that's not how it works.
[238:19.74]Waluigi's here.
[238:20.56]I think I actually got invaded twice.
[238:22.84]So I can't summon anybody else.
[238:30.13]What the fuck is that thing?
[238:31.65]Is that just a naked lady?
[238:34.29]Alright, one, two, three, four, five.
[238:37.09]Where's the last person?
[238:38.37]I think the last person... Are you Waluigi?
[238:39.97]Alright.
[238:42.81]One, two, three, four, five.
[238:44.63]Where's the last person?
[238:45.29]Alright, get over here.
[238:55.86]Alright, let's go.
[238:59.95]Ready?
[239:01.93]Good luck.
[239:05.15]In 3, 2, 1.
[239:06.33]Go.
[239:07.35]In... Go!
[239:17.39]Like, time to go.
[239:24.20]Yeah, right.
[239:24.94]I fucking see you.
[239:26.46]This guy's gonna blow it.
[239:27.40]This guy's gonna blow it.
[239:28.12]Don't let him blow it.
[239:28.66]This guy's gonna blow it.
[239:31.20]This guy's gonna blow it.
[239:32.24]This guy's gonna blow it.
[239:32.92]And then I'm gonna have to do a new password.
[239:34.93]He saved me.
[239:35.43]Thank you.
[239:35.73]Did you all fall off?
[239:40.23]How did you all fall off already?
[239:47.03]Oh god, this didn't work out as intended.
[239:49.59]They're fighting back there.
[239:53.25]Oh my god, I still can't... That guy's gonna die.
[240:08.36]Oh, you're good, Giant Dad.
[240:09.02]You're good.
[240:09.26]Giant Dad, I need your help.
[240:11.40]I needed your help, and you... What have you done?
[240:14.06]What have you done?
[240:16.16]Oh, what's that?
[240:17.16]Let me just fucking get through the whole thing!
[240:23.37]Let me just win the whole game.
[240:32.72]Get out of here.
[240:33.20]Are we going to have to do this again?
[240:42.91]Why kill it?
[240:43.43]It was an obstacle because it was going to kill me.
[240:46.73]Okay, so... I guess I win.
[240:53.25]Thank you for playing.
[240:54.00]Oh, Waluigi's back.
[240:54.98]Alright, this is actually, this is perfect, because I'm going to get to a spot where I can look.
[241:01.70]I'm in the spot where I can look right now.
[241:09.29]Alright, uh... How many people can invade me?
[241:17.53]He's not going to make it.
[241:34.94]Did I get him?
[241:43.23]Oh, no.
[241:43.49]He made it.
[241:43.89]He made it.
[241:45.03]Thank God you fucked it up.
[241:52.10]Hey, this is not... Oh.
[241:57.84]Is this actually going to happen right now?
[242:21.74]Die already!
[242:23.54]Die already!
[242:25.08]No, you're not getting away, man.
[242:26.38]I'm not going to let you do all that shit and then get out of here.
[242:41.05]Oh, you're very clever, aren't you?
[242:42.95]Both of you.
[242:59.74]Get in here.
[243:05.70]I need help.
[243:12.11]Come on.
[243:13.11]Who did I summon?
[243:13.75]Like, Dick Baggins?
[243:14.55]I don't know.
[243:15.09]Get in here.
[243:15.39]I don't even care.
[243:15.87]Alright, now we got a crew.
[243:24.82]Ah, watch it.
[243:25.32]He's gonna, like, explosions in there.
[243:29.78]He's going to try to knock you off the edge.
[243:31.28]Don't do it.
[243:31.88]It's a bait.
[243:32.54]It's a trick.
[243:36.64]It's a trick.
[243:40.40]No.
[243:40.74]What am I looking the wrong way?
[243:41.78]Alright.
[243:42.60]Oh, no.
[243:42.94]This is not going to be good.
[243:44.88]He just actually... This is stupid.
[243:49.24]Alright.
[243:49.50]Come on.
[243:49.70]You got to get in there.
[243:59.06]Alright, come on, shitbag.
[244:00.26]Wait, am I blocking him?
[244:01.10]Oh, fuck, I'm sorry.
[244:03.44]Get in there.
[244:08.63]We're not going until they're dead.
[244:15.87]Okay, that was pretty nuts.
[244:16.97]Alright, alright.
[244:17.49]And this is the new crew.
[244:19.61]Whoever this is, they're coming with me.
[244:22.11]No, not you.
[244:23.63]Not you.
[244:24.09]I don't think it's gonna be you.
[244:25.27]I don't think it's gonna be you.
[244:27.49]Let's bring you back.
[244:31.58]Did we lose another guy?
[244:33.02]Because we've got to keep going through Sen's Fortress, man.
[244:38.44]Yeah, Dick Baggins was killed, unfortunately.
[244:45.44]We got... Nope.
[244:48.50]Nope.
[244:50.46]Let's get... No.
[244:54.95]How about Karthus, dude?
[244:59.81]And once he's in... Wait, wait, wait.
[245:01.09]How does this guy keep getting into the same game?
[245:03.45]This is going to be a mess.
[245:08.41]People are going to die here.
[245:09.23]Alright, he's dead.
[245:19.69]Congratulations.
[245:21.98]Alright, we got one more guy coming up.
[245:26.04]Last one didn't get summoned.
[245:30.04]Alright, here he comes.
[245:32.35]We gotta work together, it's gonna be fast, by the way.
[245:49.34]Okay, that's it, goodbye.
[245:57.72]Every single person.
[245:59.34]Alright, that's... Alright, goodnight everybody.
[246:03.89]That was fun while it lasted.
[246:12.71]Stay together, die together.
[246:13.81]That's right.
[246:16.55]Well, that concludes Dark Souls.
[246:19.59]We're not going to be going back.
[246:26.56]Uh...
[246:28.55]Great game.
[246:30.05]Big fan.
[246:31.35]Had a blast playing through all the large amount of streams that we did.
[246:35.67]So, I will see you guys on Tuesday.
[246:39.17]Today is Sunday, so not tomorrow, but the next day.
[246:42.30]We're going to start Destroy All Humans 2.
[246:46.72]Heard a lot of great things about it, so... Thank you, everybody, for playing.
[246:54.81]That was very fun.
[246:58.46]And with that, we're going to do the credits.
[247:00.53]But before we do that, I'm actually going to go to the bathroom because I have to pee again.
[247:04.17]So I'm going to do the stream over sign here.
[247:07.82]But I'll be right back.
[247:08.92]We'll do the credits and we'll do the bits.
[247:10.02]See you in a minute.
[247:51.65]Thank you.
[249:16.76]Alright.
[249:19.01]Let me just close out of this.
[249:24.83]Oh, Dark Souls.
[249:29.15]Yeah, I'm kind of sad that it's over.
[249:31.77]I will say.
[249:35.93]Dark Souls is such an interesting game where it takes so much effort and it's so stressful and it's a very long experience that when it's done, you're kind of like, oh, that's it.
[249:47.40]It's done.
[249:48.62]Oh, but... Is it, though?
[249:50.26]Oh, it is.
[249:51.22]Oh.
[249:52.51]I get a little sad.
[249:53.39]It's alright.
[249:55.11]Dark Souls 2 will be out soon.
[249:57.39]Alright, credits time.
[249:58.89]Thank you, everybody, for subbing and resubbing.

[252:55.95]Thank you to Atrolux.
[252:58.25]Thank you Atrolux for the $1.
[252:59.41]Jeremy, my man, I can't watch at the moment so I'll catch the VOD tomorrow.
[253:02.23]I just want to say you get featured on Kotaku.
[253:08.28]Uh, yep.
[253:08.80]That is the... We talked about it a little bit before.
[253:14.59]But, that's cool.
[253:15.63]I mean... That, like, clip has, like, two or three hundred thousand views now.
[253:21.01]Which... I... I don't know why.
[253:23.87]I mean, something like that, I guess.
[253:27.41]It was just an interesting title.
[253:29.85]You know, it was kind of like, Hey, Guy Dies at Dark Souls Boss.
[253:32.29]Isn't that weird?
[253:34.21]It's like, I guess so.
[253:35.04]Yeah.
[253:38.02]But, no, that's cool.
[253:39.08]I mean, obviously, that's very interesting to know that.
[253:46.62]But thank you, actual looks.
[253:47.32]Thank you, E-Troop, for the $1.
[253:48.72]Hello, Jeremy.

[254:06.65]uh thank you fujigi oh fujio for the one dollar hey Jeremy you made me laugh over the years and I met some good friends through your Discord also you pronounced my name wrong guaranteed that is a 100 guaranteed garfield the Monday killer thanks for the one dollar the great garfield have returned with a brand spanking new garfograph and a Sunday comic
[254:31.96]You're in... You're an inspiration to Garf and friends and you're a Jerma's son on a dark universe.
[254:38.69]We compliment you so much because you're an airhead.
[254:42.85]Oh, you're no airhead.
[254:43.83]Okay, thanks, man.
[254:46.31]You're a swell guy who never gets swelled head, a lasagna with cheese, a pizza with just enough cheese.
[254:54.21]Thank you, Garfield.

[255:02.03]I can't even click it.
[255:02.79]I'm like on fumes right now.
[255:06.89]There you go.
[255:08.79]I'll let you read it.
[255:12.21]In the old-fashioned Garfield style.
[255:17.48]Is the bottom of this about joining the army?
[255:19.38]What is going on here?
[255:23.10]But thank you, Garfield.
[255:25.62]I hope you lose a little weight.
[255:26.92]Because you look a little chunky.
[255:31.41]Hey, Atrolux, thanks for the $1.
[255:33.96]My last bit message was totally wasted.
[255:35.90]Here's another hundo bits.
[255:37.70]Going to be an update on the emote contest.
[255:40.42]Been going for about a week now.
[255:41.46]I wonder if you checked out some of the submissions.
[255:43.04]No.
[255:44.66]I cannot tell you what submissions I've looked at.
[255:47.38]I can't tell you if I think some of them are good.
[255:50.97]I cannot do that.
[255:52.49]Because if I say, oh, take a look at this one, guys, that automatically inserts bias into everybody's brain.
[256:01.62]So it's been one week.
[256:04.29]We will touch base again about this in like three or four days.
[256:11.17]Once we get to like a full two weeks, that's like submissions, right?
[256:14.83]After the two week period, I'm going to...
[256:19.43]obviously get in contact with some people and some mods we're gonna do like one pass through there's a whole thing we're gonna do until we get to like 20 to 30 submissions that we're gonna vote for on stream so we will talk about this next week the reason this two week period was just to give people enough time to make them right we'll talk soon uh but thank you dude thank you x optic meme shot for the dollar 50
[256:50.41]Is this the streamer that beat Bed of Chaos on his first try just days ago?
[256:54.83]Yes, it is.
[256:57.57]Mm-hmm.
[256:59.47]Except it wasn't first try, it was like... How many times did I die to The Bed of Chaos?
[257:06.07]I don't even remember.
[257:09.23]It was more than like seven or eight, wasn't it?
[257:12.11]Seven?
[257:13.77]Was that the most I've died to any boss in the game?
[257:18.50]No, there was one other, wasn't there?
[257:21.69]I died to Manus at least five times, didn't I?
[257:25.83]Nine?
[257:31.85]How many?
[257:32.11]Yeah, just go by the playlist.
[257:33.39]How many songs were played?
[257:35.35]Manus was three.
[257:36.19]Okay.
[257:38.99]Hey, thank you, Carlos.
[257:40.19]Carlos the Clam for the $5.
[257:41.08]Hey, do you have a weird request, but could you open up... Hold on, let me read this.
[257:50.82]Oh, this is from a long time ago.
[257:52.38]So I don't think it still is relevant.
[257:54.98]They wanted me to open up somebody's stream and stream it.
[257:57.74]Because they're streaming somebody else watching somebody stream.
[258:00.78]Watching somebody stream.
[258:02.44]Watching another person stream.
[258:07.26]I think I missed the boat on this one.
[258:11.64]But thank you, Carlos.
[258:13.02]I was not attentive to it immediately.
[258:17.74]But thanks.
[258:20.90]Does this one count?
[258:24.04]Wait, does what?
[258:25.48]Does this stream count?
[258:26.52]I don't know.
[258:28.80]Isn't that against Terms of Service?
[258:30.28]I think it is, but I think you have to get reported for it.
[258:33.88]So, I don't know.
[258:37.13]Thank you, Mando.
[258:37.75]Thank you, C.S.
[258:38.63]Makowski for the $1.
[258:39.73]Hey, Jerma, is this live?
[258:42.31]Someone told me you died when I moved to Vegas and I really needed to know.
[258:48.23]No, I'm here.
[258:49.99]I've not left yet.
[258:51.31]So, no.
[258:53.25]I'm very much still alive.
[258:58.23]Thank you for that, by the way.
[259:00.25]Thank you, C.S.
[259:01.01]Makowski.
[259:02.39]Hey, Jujubees, thanks for the $10.
[259:03.94]No message, just $10.
[259:05.10]Thank you so much, Jujubee.
[259:10.56]Just reported you for it?
[259:13.72]I didn't do anything.
[259:16.12]They got logs.
[259:16.76]They can see.
[259:19.38]But thank you for the $10, Doojabee.
[259:20.50]Appreciate it.
[259:21.74]Spruce, that's GameSucks.
[259:23.94]Thanks for the $1.
[259:24.82]Quality streamer, man.
[259:27.12]Sometimes.
[259:28.50]Thank you.
[259:29.24]Thank you, GameSucks again for the $1.
[259:30.78]They say PogChamp.
[259:32.02]Must have done something awesome.
[259:33.34]I think I did something awesome.
[259:38.59]Thank you, Sputa, for the $5.
[259:39.65]I've been watching some Dark Souls 3 streams recently, and I have to ask, do you think you'd ever do a Red Run stream for Dark Souls 3 with chat?
[259:49.79]What's a red run?
[259:52.43]Red run?
[259:56.75]What's the context there?
[259:59.80]I've never heard of that before.
[260:05.82]Murder?
[260:06.18]You chase with invaders.
[260:11.28]So I get chased around and I have to beat the game?
[260:18.53]So you just add five extra enemies to the game?
[260:23.00]Oh, that's funny.
[260:25.18]I feel like we kind of were doing that a little bit.
[260:27.32]Not, you know, start to finish the game, though.
[260:34.77]Chat has to try to kill you.
[260:40.35]Sounds fun, though.
[260:42.35]Hey, game sucks.
[260:43.01]Thanks again for the $1.
[260:43.97]If Knife Pervert isn't in Jerma Rumble, I'm going to unsubscribe.
[260:48.75]We'll have to see.
[260:50.01]We'll have to see.
[260:53.98]Maybe.
[260:57.04]Thank you, Sadad, again for the two bucks.
[261:00.59]Hello, Jeremy.
[261:01.17]It's me again.
[261:01.77]I demand you let me reinitiate into the ice cream cult.
[261:05.23]Please allow the compact spirit of ice cream to live on.
[261:08.55]The Holy Rodent has declared a truce must be reconsidered.
[261:11.78]This stream is vile, repugnant, and evil.
[261:13.62]By the way, I just wanted to confirm the date and location of the sacrifice.
[261:17.04]Okay, bye.
[261:17.70]Thank you for your time and we'll be in touch.
[261:23.69]Mark it on your calendars.
[261:27.31]Every day next week.
[261:32.46]Thank you all of OneZombie for the $1.
[261:35.30]Remember that time on Yellow Brick Road where Dorothy punched a guy's spine out because he didn't listen?
[261:41.10]That's the alternate universe.
[261:42.98]It's not canon, but, you know, it's good enough.
[261:46.06]Thank you Ultralaven for the $1.
[261:47.70]Hello, Jeremy.
[261:48.34]It's me again.
[261:51.28]Italic said the ice cream application office was not open for business.
[261:54.96]Unfortunately, this means I cannot make it on Monday, so if we could reschedule that, that would be great.
[261:58.98]Thank you from all of us.
[262:00.46]What's going on here?
[262:04.02]What are we talking about right now?
[262:10.23]Did Italic say something about me?
[262:15.25]That swine.
[262:19.01]I thank you, Bobby boy.
[262:20.37]Oh, Bobby Bob for the $1.
[262:23.54]Here's a dream I had about you.
[262:25.08]Please read it on stream.
[262:26.04]You want to read it on stream.
[262:26.94]Okay.
[262:29.72]Okay, so this is a dream that you had about me.
[262:33.42]Okay.
[262:33.60]Okay.
[262:35.27]I had a dream last night where you were playing a game where you solve optimization puzzles.
[262:39.45]So you'd have to optimize how traffic flowed or the size of certain containers.
[262:43.40]And eventually you had to optimize things like arms and legs and then entire humans.
[262:48.26]You eventually found out that it wasn't just a game and that each puzzle you did was implemented into the real world.
[262:54.18]And you found a factory with thousands of assorted body parts and the abominations of the optimized humans you were creating.
[263:00.46]But at this point, you had started to make lots of money from this optimization, so you didn't try to stop the experiments, even though they were becoming more and more gruesome.
[263:08.46]And eventually you were fully corrupted by money power.
[263:12.82]And... It ends.
[263:15.80]There.
[263:26.24]What else was I corrupted by?
[263:27.52]I need to know!
[263:31.78]Why was this dream about me doing this?
[263:34.24]And not, like, you.
[263:36.08]Or somebody else.
[263:39.24]That's a cliffhanger.
[263:40.04]You're never gonna find out.
[263:41.04]Well, that's... Can't leave me hanging like that.
[263:52.03]Thank you, Bob.
[263:53.31]For your, uh... Nightmare.
[263:57.42]Hey, Squirds.
[263:58.20]Thank you, Squirds, for the $10.50.
[263:59.18]Thank you, Squirds.
[264:01.69]No message.
[264:02.23]Thank you.
[264:02.67]Collie Brady.
[264:03.35]Again, thank you for the $50 earlier.
[264:07.01]Big money, dude.
[264:07.53]Thank you.
[264:09.81]Hawkeye of mine.
[264:10.59]Thank you for the $15.
[264:11.87]A lot of money here.
[264:13.57]Back to back to back.
[264:14.29]Thanks a lot, guys.
[264:14.95]Seriously.
[264:15.67]Alright, let's take a look.
[264:18.95]Alright, this is an image of a guy with a firework up his ass, I guess.
[264:24.87]I don't know what this is.
[264:31.70]Alright, well, I ain't going to show that one.
[264:34.27]I don't think I'm going to put that on the monitor over here.
[264:38.87]Thank you, though.
[264:39.62]Thank you, Fatoru, for the five bucks.
[264:42.66]One of the bodyguards, thank you.
[264:45.64]Thanks for the five dollars, man.
[264:48.11]Thanks for playing as well.
[264:50.73]Uh, Zaza Salt, thanks for the one dollar and one cent.
[264:53.25]Hello, Jerma, it's me again.
[264:54.43]Uh, worrisome thoughts consume my grandmother.
[264:59.74]He... My grandmother He-He's.
[265:02.30]That's her name.
[265:02.96]I have concerns about her mental state.
[265:06.18]She's doing questionable, scary things.
[265:07.66]We need your help.
[265:18.29]Um...
[265:20.43]I'm not the one to ask.
[265:22.05]I don't know what to say.
[265:22.77]Uh... Get in touch with the local authorities and... Talk to... Get Grandma Hihi to somebody that can help her.
[265:34.76]This is not... Is this real?
[265:37.76]Is this real?
[265:38.56]I don't know.
[265:39.28]Is this real?
[265:41.56]Am I answering this?
[265:44.62]Take that advice.
[265:45.42]That's what I'd give you.
[265:46.52]Thank you, Zaza Salt.
[265:50.12]Is anything even real?
[265:53.39]Hey, StixRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[265:56.19]Number of Souls games Jerma has beaten ever since he'd say he'd watch Rat Movie 1 and 2 on stream is 2.
[266:01.49]Why don't we go for a third?
[266:05.87]Hey, thank you Likeabot for $1.
[266:11.02]I need a bigger club.
[266:17.64]That's on you.
[266:20.47]And thank you, eefs, for the $10.50.
[266:21.35]Thanks for the 10 bucks, eefs.
[266:23.96]I was the first person you summoned, Flug.
[266:26.78]And I'm still absolutely broken that the guy completely eviscerated us when he invaded, but always.
[266:32.70]And anyways, look, dude.
[266:35.86]Yeah, that guy came over and did the purple magic and killed everybody.
[266:42.63]Bunch of bullshit, if you ask me.
[266:46.61]Hey, Killcode!
[266:48.01]Thanks for the $5, Killcode.
[266:50.52]Hello Jeremy, it's us again.
[266:52.10]We're pleased to become the one milky patriot.
[266:56.54]I give you a wonderful document filled with the most beautiful and amazing laws.
[266:59.98]Breaking these rules will ruin our relationship with Grandma HeHe.
[267:03.08]That's her name.
[267:04.40]Much gratitude from all of us and me.
[267:05.86]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[267:08.64]What are you guys talking about?
[267:12.58]What are you guys talking about?
[267:14.45]What is this?
[267:19.95]Who made this up?
[267:22.39]Okay, these are the laws of the ice cream cult.
[267:26.89]There's 20 laws.
[267:30.65]Oh my god.
[267:31.45]Alright, the laws of the ice cream.
[267:33.11]Number one.
[267:34.44]Let's just read them.
[267:35.50]You shall never pass the memorial.
[267:38.30]Jeremy doesn't suck.
[267:42.50]It's not sexual.
[267:43.40]Things are, uh, in Boston.
[267:45.40]Stream.
[267:46.20]Five is nothing.
[267:48.38]Gamers rise the... What am I even... What the fuck am I reading?
[268:00.66]Fishing is fun, except when confronted by Grandma Hihi.
[268:03.19]That's her name.
[268:03.95]Dumbass.
[268:05.97]Doorknob enthusiasts shall never forget the memorial.
[268:13.61]This is like an Etalyx thing.
[268:15.61]I see Etalyx' name here like three times.
[268:24.99]What do you guys... I'm going to have to hit him up after this and be like, what the fuck is this grandma memorial thing you're doing?
[268:33.26]Join the cult.
[268:36.46]I'm going to have to read more about it.
[268:39.98]But thank you for your 20 commandments of the grandma heehee cult.
[268:46.43]Thank you.
[268:47.43]Kill code.
[268:48.37]And hey, nice shirt, by the way.
[268:50.17]I'm expecting it soon.
[268:53.52]Thank you, Poodoo, for the $5.
[268:54.94]Hi, Jerma.
[268:56.46]My husband and I are longtime fans, and tonight he had the honor of playing alongside you as Frank Reynolds.
[269:01.82]Thanks for all the fun over the years.
[269:02.86]Good luck with the move to Vegas.
[269:03.92]Thank you.
[269:06.41]Thank you so much.
[269:09.37]Thank you, Poodoo.
[269:11.75]Happy to play.
[269:15.37]He did a great job.
[269:16.71]He protected me.
[269:18.49]I think he fell off the ledge once, but it's alright.
[269:24.04]Thanks to the both of you so much.
[269:26.92]Hey, Hawkeye of Mine, thanks for the $1.50.
[269:28.51]You're really going elbow deep in those Blighttown fellas' butts, huh?
[269:34.69]Yes.
[269:36.53]Hey, Mandragore.
[269:38.93]Thank you, Mandragore, for the $1.00.
[269:40.75]They say no message, just Pride 100.
[269:44.01]Thank you.
[269:45.78]Kyra Toby, thanks for the $50 again.
[269:47.54]$50.
[269:50.34]Thank you so much, man.
[269:52.38]Dropping big money again.
[269:55.01]Thanks, dude.
[269:56.24]Really appreciate it.
[270:01.04]Big money.
[270:03.02]Then they say, come on, Faye.
[270:05.06]During that encounter.
[270:08.03]Hey, Eeps, thanks for the $2.45.
[270:09.69]Happy I got to beat Pinwheel with you, Jeremy.
[270:13.15]I'm going out for the night, so I'll definitely be re-watching the VOD.
[270:15.59]Hey, thanks for helping me.
[270:17.06]You didn't help, actually.
[270:18.32]I beat Pinwheel.
[270:20.57]I came in there with two shitty fists and got... He got triple health.
[270:25.99]And I beat him with the stupid fucking hands.
[270:29.24]It might have been you that killstealed me, but I beat that boss.
[270:37.58]Thank you, Yves.
[270:42.23]Hey, thank you, Fizzy Milk, for the $1.
[270:43.75]Thanks for everything you do.
[270:44.53]Thanks for everything you do.
[270:45.43]Thanks for being here in the first place.
[270:47.15]Thank you, man.
[270:47.73]Seriously.
[270:49.38]Hey Razzle, thanks for the one dollar.
[270:50.76]Hey Jerm.
[270:51.98]I recently got into Bloodborne per your recommendation and I've been having an absolute blast.
[270:56.69]You have any tips on how to beat Dark Eater Parle?
[271:00.63]The electric shaggy looking motherfucker.
[271:02.95]Every time I walk through that fog and he knocks me on my ass like it's 52 pickup.
[271:07.09]He's beating me like he beats his dick.
[271:12.29]It's overall bad.
[271:13.48]Help me out.
[271:14.82]Well...
[271:17.14]I believe... I believe there's a way that you can... I just stayed underneath him.
[271:24.92]If you stay, like, try to get, like, under his belly, he kind of really can't do much to you.
[271:32.32]I think there's also a way you can, like, turn off his electricity, can't you?
[271:35.93]Can't you, like, do, like, enough damage to him where he stops?
[271:40.37]He'll, like, get flipped over or something, right?
[271:41.89]And he doesn't do the electric thing anymore.
[271:46.40]But yeah, he was a pain.
[271:50.40]Good luck to you, Razzle.
[271:51.18]Hopefully you beat it.
[271:51.92]It's one of the best games I've ever played.
[271:54.22]Hey, Captain Morgan, thanks for the $1.
[271:55.70]All the kids at school bully me for watching.
[271:57.18]This is the swirly thing about how I didn't beat Pinwheel.
[271:59.18]That's fine.
[271:59.68]Thank you, Tar Alacrin, for the $1.
[272:02.60]Now that Jervis is moving to the desert, I guess we can't make the local streamer does X joke anymore because he will no longer be local.
[272:09.79]Well, I won't be local to you, but I might be local to somebody else.
[272:14.87]If you live in, like, if you live in Nevada, if you're in the Las Vegas spot there, you can say that still.
[272:24.57]I'll always be local to somebody.
[272:29.23]But thank you, Tar.
[272:31.05]Hey, Mashaloni, thanks for the $1.
[272:33.00]All the bullies that the kid used waiting for school, watching school.
[272:36.12]Hold on, what?
[272:38.23]All the bullies that he kid you for watching school.
[272:41.45]They said the pinwheel couldn't beat jermaOn a five without swirly.
[272:44.81]But he said I could I was pinwheel and non tomorrow is going to give me a dying Johnny beat couldn't meet just why wrong?
[272:51.99]You just scrambled it.
[272:53.77]Thanks, man.
[273:01.33]Uh, Shapom has a joke I want to read.
[273:03.35]Thank you, Shapom.
[273:05.09]Uh, Jeremiah, I made this joke and I'm really proud.
[273:06.71]I want you to read it.
[273:08.29]A tall bowl of spaghetti walks into a bar.
[273:10.88]It sits down and asks for a drink.
[273:12.38]The bartender says, how's the weather up there?
[273:15.28]Cloudy with a chance of meatballs.
[273:16.64]This is a fully original joke.
[273:18.60]Don't take it.
[273:20.66]Thank you, Kilgannon, for the $1.
[273:22.14]If you read this, your channel, don't read it.
[273:24.94]Something about somebody's channel getting deleted if it was read the whole sentence in a row there.
[273:28.26]I didn't read it.
[273:28.94]Thank you, Kilgannon.
[273:29.66]Thank you, Shapon, for the $1.
[273:33.82]Rated rating on the joke.
[273:35.42]Thank you, dude.
[273:36.84]Hey, Swifty Bagel, thanks for the $1.50.
[273:38.63]House Flipper stream when?
[273:41.41]Probably never.
[273:42.53]Probably never again.
[273:43.93]It's a great game.
[273:44.45]Don't get it on sale.
[273:45.67]Don't get it at full price if you want.
[273:48.03]It's available.
[273:50.02]And wrapping us up, thank you Hawkeye of Mine for the two dollars.
[273:53.46]No message, thank you so much, dude.
[273:55.54]And Clueless Sniper!
[273:58.45]Thank you Clueless Sniper for the one dollar.
[273:59.95]Hi Germo, a lot of people have been sharing their dogs lately, so I thought I would hop on the bandwagon.
[274:04.47]The only problem is I don't own a dog.
[274:06.45]So here's a picture of my turtle.
[274:07.93]His name is Speedy.
[274:09.00]Oh my god.
[274:12.50]He's adorable!
[274:13.16]That's so- Is he huge?
[274:14.32]How big is he?
[274:15.78]Is he like 10 feet long?
[274:17.90]You took this, you're like standing back 100 feet, right?
[274:21.00]And you're at like a giant rock canyon.
[274:22.54]That's so awesome.
[274:23.98]I wish I had like a fucking 50 foot long turtle.
[274:30.75]To like ride it.
[274:36.79]He's very cute.
[274:39.13]Can't turtles live like 30 or 40 years, by the way?
[274:46.25]Turtles can get real old.
[274:47.93]So, that's cool.
[274:51.77]Thanks a lot, man.
[274:52.75]He's adorable.
[274:55.05]And with that, thank you so much, everybody, for watching.
[274:59.03]I'm getting, like, the post-Dark Souls depression right now.
[275:01.67]Like, I'm sad that it's over.
[275:03.63]That I've done them all.
[275:04.35]I've beat them all.
[275:05.55]I've seen everything there is to see in every single Soulsborne game.
[275:10.63]That's like sad.
[275:12.71]I always held on to Dark Souls and put it in my back pocket.
[275:15.41]No, no, no.
[275:15.75]See, I've never played that one.
[275:17.29]So I can always have more Dark Souls.
[275:22.10]It's done.
[275:26.88]Played Nioh.
[275:28.62]Yeah, but Nioh's not FromSoftware.
[275:30.56]It's not the same.
[275:32.32]It's like similar, but it's not the real thing, you know?
[275:37.75]Sekiro is just around the corner.
[275:39.03]That's true.
[275:43.70]But with that, I will see you guys on Tuesday for Destroy All Humans.
