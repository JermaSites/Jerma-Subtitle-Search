[ve:60.16.100]

[00:21.68]Hey, what's up?
[00:24.55]How's it going?
[00:28.45]Early, that's right, yeah.
[00:43.93]Hello.
[00:48.30]Are you there?
[00:48.72]Yeah.
[00:50.99]Hey, everybody.
[00:52.43]You hear who that is?
[00:53.47]It's um... Who is it?
[00:57.77]What's your name?
[00:58.27]I feel like it starts with... Uh... It's Str.
[01:02.87]Oh, it's Str.
[01:03.86]Hey, how's it going?
[01:05.14]Hey, and I'm absolutely gonna not be weird anymore.
[01:09.36]Why?
[01:10.67]I just figured like I've been being like too weird and I'm like, I'm done.
[01:13.59]Are you turning over a new leaf here?
[01:17.59]Yeah.
[01:18.67]Interesting.
[01:19.67]I sense that like a lot of the times I make you uncomfortable and I'm just going to be super normal today.
[01:29.00]Alright, so what that actually means is that in like 25 minutes, you're going to turn your webcam on and just be naked.
[01:37.42]What?
[01:38.30]Why?
[01:39.38]You're going to turn your webcam on.
[01:40.32]You're going to be wearing like a... I don't know what you're going to be doing.
[01:44.86]Why can't you trust me for like one stream?
[01:49.21]I'm not going to be weird today.
[01:50.97]Nothing strange is going to happen.
[01:53.21]I'm turning over a new leaf.
[01:55.53]My wife is the same exact way.
[01:58.37]And I've talked about this before.
[01:59.79]Whenever I say, can I borrow one of your bras?
[02:02.49]And I'm not going to do anything weird with it.
[02:04.37]She won't let me have it.
[02:10.37]But why does it have to be prefaced with something weird?
[02:13.87]Why do you have to say that?
[02:15.23]It's not going to be weird.
[02:17.12]I'm going to be totally normal.
[02:18.54]I'm going to be incredibly professional, and we're going to have a fantastic time playing Ember Knights, my second Ember related game.
[02:25.84]Yeah, that's another thing we have to bring up.
[02:27.78]I'm sorry.
[02:28.22]I have to apologize to everybody.
[02:29.48]This is the second Ember game that Ster has wanted us to play.
[02:33.48]Am I stream dying?
[02:35.93]What's going on here?
[02:37.93]I hope not.
[02:39.77]It's just so not used to being live that it's like rejecting it.
[02:42.85]Why does it say it's unstable?
[02:44.05]It's weird.
[02:46.81]Ster, please.
[02:50.76]What?
[02:51.14]No, you're fine.
[02:52.14]Relax.
[02:54.09]Alright, so can you explain what this game is?
[02:57.76]And wait, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[03:00.44]What are we doing after?
[03:02.74]We are 100% today doing the Five Nights at Freddy's watch-along stream.
[03:09.51]Yes!
[03:10.55]He's so excited.
[03:12.23]I've been waiting for this for like a month, by the way.
[03:14.27]I've got threats in the mail from him since the last time we didn't do it.
[03:19.57]And he thinks I don't know it was him.
[03:22.62]You promised us!
[03:24.56]I'll do it.
[03:25.12]Alright.
[03:28.18]So those that don't know, this is Ember Knights.
[03:31.15]It is a friend game.
[03:33.45]I actually don't even know what this is.
[03:35.51]I just downloaded it.
[03:37.33]I'm not entirely sure.
[03:38.99]It's generally like a co-op beat-em-up.
[03:41.37]What was the old game that you co-op and you beat-em-up?
[03:47.78]Battletoads?
[03:49.30]Yeah.
[03:50.28]Sure.
[03:51.00]It's Battletoads.
[03:52.38]It's like Battletoads?
[03:53.54]It's a roguelike.
[03:55.87]and I don't really know I don't know I've actually heard all jokes aside I've heard good things I that's too I've heard very good things I was playing uh I I was having you know a little bit of a roguelike kick again and I was like I never tried Ember Knights when it came out and it's got updates so hey did you tweet oh no I didn't tweet I didn't tweet I usually just copy your tweet
[04:23.16]I don't know a single streamer that likes tweeting that they're live.
[04:28.80]Yeah, I don't know why I still do it.
[04:32.24]Why do I still do that?
[04:33.75]Do you do that still?
[04:35.29]Do what?
[04:36.09]To tweet out every stream you do.
[04:39.45]Mine are forgettable, so I don't need to let people know.
[04:42.99]I feel like I just... That's a thing that has been a thing since like 2012.
[04:47.60]And I just never stopped doing it.
[04:50.86]It's the only thing I put on my Twitter.
[04:53.80]Well, better than nothing.
[04:57.30]You can set it up to be automatic.
[05:00.87]I could do that, but I don't know.
[05:02.43]I feel like I have to be doing it.
[05:03.89]Then it has like a really lame.
[05:06.33]It's like a lame generic default tweet.
[05:09.45]It doesn't have the extra flair.
[05:14.79]Why is my character named Combo Meal?
[05:17.01]Because.
[05:20.49]I felt like it today.
[05:24.51]Alright, are you good to go?
[05:27.41]That depends.
[05:28.05]Are you good to go?
[05:28.81]I mean, I am now.
[05:31.85]By the way, you're only getting face cam for 10 minutes today.
[05:34.60]I've decided.
[05:37.02]Oh, why is that?
[05:41.54]Why?
[05:43.26]Because I had a... I had wicked big sideburns and I was going to do like a big sideburn joke.
[05:50.85]Wait, why did you do it?
[05:52.87]I know, because I like...
[05:58.00]I had to leave the house.
[06:01.01]And I was like, okay, if I leave the house, then I'm going to look fucking weird.
[06:06.61]Because I did it deliberately weird.
[06:09.61]It was so bunched up right here.
[06:12.79]I'll have to do, like, the shave joke.
[06:17.09]Have something real weird.
[06:18.71]But not today.
[06:19.43]Today is very normal.
[06:22.17]No, just do wait.
[06:24.37]Wait, do you want to have the be as gross as possible challenge with me?
[06:27.87]What is that?
[06:29.85]I don't think I need to explain very much more.
[06:32.68]Be as when?
[06:34.66]Is this like a date?
[06:36.16]Or is this just now?
[06:37.76]No, this is just like, just don't shave and don't cut your hair for like a year.
[06:43.10]I'm trying to do the not shave again.
[06:46.43]My beard's getting pretty chunky.
[06:48.99]So I've been trimming it so that it doesn't go in my mouth.
[06:53.29]I don't even know what would happen to me.
[06:58.88]When I talk about don't shave, I mean nothing.
[07:03.14]You don't do any cleanup.
[07:04.54]You don't do any trims.
[07:05.76]It's just let it just go and don't do anything.
[07:09.56]You have to.
[07:10.22]Do you?
[07:11.18]A little bit.
[07:12.25]Well, for me, my mustache gets long enough that it curls into my mouth.
[07:17.33]And if I didn't trim that, then it's like I'm eating my own hair all day.
[07:23.92]Yeah.
[07:24.76]Well, the one thing that I would allow is that.
[07:29.22]Just trim it so that doesn't go in your mouth, but everything else has to stay.
[07:33.35]Okay.
[07:34.37]I mean, yeah, go for it.
[07:35.81]Have you ever had a beard?
[07:38.42]The same thing happens every single time.
[07:39.81]I get to the point where I get to that exact moment where just let it go for another month and see what it looks like.
[07:47.99]And I go, no, this is fucked up looking and I get rid of it.
[07:51.79]I never cross that threshold.
[07:53.85]I got to break through the awkward stage.
[07:57.31]That's right.
[07:57.71]And I never do.
[07:59.62]Just a mustache, I think, would be great for you.
[08:03.70]My head doesn't feel especially like a little a little curly mustache on the ends.
[08:07.94]It feels like that's your vibe.
[08:09.98]By the way, I took the Ster my type test and the answer is no.
[08:14.36]Well, no one was my type.
[08:17.20]That was impossible.
[08:21.81]Can you air dash?
[08:24.05]Yeah.
[08:25.47]Can you eat me whole?
[08:26.59]No.
[08:29.99]I put a freebie on there for you.
[08:31.45]You did.
[08:33.57]So you probably had more than most.
[08:36.69]Yeah.
[08:37.03]Turns out.
[08:37.55]Sorry.
[08:39.69]Not compatible.
[08:41.35]Sorry.
[08:43.65]I mean, if you got like 20%, I could make some.
[08:50.53]Will you press A for me, please?
[08:52.17]Are we playing?
[08:53.55]I'm waiting for you.
[08:54.93]You never explained the grossest pot- was the grossest possible stream just grow your beard out?
[08:59.64]You can't walk and chew gum at the same time?
[09:02.64]Why- why don't even know anything about the game- we're gonna- like as soon as I click start game if you're gonna say: Quiet, there's a cinematic.
[09:08.64]And then you're gonna say like wait I don't know what these bugs are-
[09:09.64]There is no cinematic in this game. Is- that- that's not gonna happen we're going- it's like a roguelike.
[09:15.64]Alright I just want one question answered.
[09:18.00]Yeah. Is the grossest possible stream just you growing your beard?
[09:22.50]Yeah it's just- it just don't- yeah.
[09:27.06]How is that gross?
[09:28.32]Well, it's not, I mean, I'm just saying, like, just, I don't know, maybe the word is disheveled?
[09:32.88]What's the right word?
[09:35.36]So anyone who has a beard is, like, gross and disheveled?
[09:38.59]No, no, I'm saying if you don't do any, don't, like, trim it, don't do any maintenance, don't do any trimming, just let it just go caveman style.
[09:47.39]There are plenty of people that rock beards phenomenally well.
[09:52.73]I'm talking no maintenance at all.
[09:54.05]I'm just talking, just let it go, caveman style.
[09:56.13]And I'm talking eyebrows too.
[09:58.33]And ear hair, and the hair that grows in your fucking ear too.
[10:00.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[10:01.63]You shave your eyebrows?
[10:04.25]No, I, fuck.
[10:07.24]You don't, you don't do any maintenance here?
[10:08.68]No.
[10:10.00]Oh, come on.
[10:11.72]Come on, Gwen.
[10:12.64]I was born this way.
[10:14.28]Come on, Gwen.
[10:14.82]Okay.
[10:15.78]And you don't, you don't pull the gross old man hairs out of your ears?
[10:20.74]Never.
[10:21.58]That's not a thing.
[10:22.66]That's not a thing.
[10:23.38]I said I wasn't going to be gross today and look at you.
[10:26.26]You're just trying to fill the void I've left.
[10:28.00]I do like that it points to me and says you.
[10:36.43]How is plucking your eyebrows just slightly?
[10:41.13]I don't like when hair is in the middle.
[10:45.27]That's fine if you don't want a unibrow, but when you're saying, like, I pluck my brows, that's a whole... No, I'm talking about, like, here.
[10:53.17]Come on.
[10:55.23]And look.
[10:55.69]What, you want to do a little bit of maintenance?
[10:58.53]I think you're ashamed of being a man.
[11:01.52]I've just told you I wanted to grow all my hair out for, like, a year.
[11:04.78]But you also called it gross and disheveled to grow your hair out.
[11:09.42]You're missing the context.
[11:10.42]He's ashamed.
[11:12.67]What is this sound effect that you're making right now with your mouth?
[11:16.55]Am I?
[11:16.91]This is not you doing this?
[11:18.73]No, that's just like void waiting for all.
[11:23.79]We just got to go.
[11:24.51]We don't have anything.
[11:25.81]No.
[11:27.21]Enter the tears of the kingdom.
[11:29.03]OK, and you skipped the opening cutscene.
[11:30.63]You fucked up my joke.
[11:31.51]I didn't because we already saw it before the stream.
[11:34.07]It didn't exist.
[11:35.11]What's going on right now?
[11:36.07]Why is it so weird?
[11:39.29]What?
[11:41.17]What is going on?
[11:41.93]What's happening with this?
[11:44.41]I don't know.
[11:44.97]It's certainly not me because I'm not doing anything weird.
[11:50.84]Did you do this?
[11:53.40]I don't even know what you're talking about.
[11:58.74]Alright, you ready?
[12:01.28]So, is money in this game?
[12:02.99]Are you serious?
[12:04.07]There's seriously money.
[12:05.45]Apparently, we both got the money.
[12:10.00]share it that's good oh yeah you know dodge rolls yeah you know dodge rolls so do we have any context of what's happening right now watch out I don't think so I think the world's ending and we're the only ones who can save it because we're the Ember Knight hey hey idiot idiot are there iframes I haven't played this I I'm in a weird mood I'm sorry
[12:38.60]he hasn't streamed in a while and just comes back and is like I'm gonna go super crazy I'm gonna do something insane that you guys have never seen but I'm not gonna shave but I mean it was it's good it's different to everybody here dude I gotta say I'm cooking up some wild I'm telling you I'm not gonna shave for two months
[13:07.12]The Jerma content's gone a weird direction.
[13:10.40]Wait, wait, wait.
[13:10.78]We have to decide who gets what.
[13:14.38]Do we share?
[13:14.98]I want the charge.
[13:17.38]We need to roll for it.
[13:20.96]I guess I'm going to be the fire guy.
[13:23.14]Well, your head looks like fire.
[13:24.66]You're a fireman.
[13:25.34]It's kind of your thing.
[13:28.79]Oh, you have to hit enemies ten times to get your thing back.
[13:33.43]Oh, okay.
[13:34.55]Okay, so we just wasted them.
[13:38.15]that sounded like a burp at first and now it doesn't now it does annoying my joke is ruined are we gonna are we gonna destroy I was thinking today because I heard that like diablo 4 is like closer launch than I thought and I was like I should ask drama if you want to like do a co-op diablo 4 when it comes out and now he's going to destroy every single barrel
[14:00.95]I'm just going to read every single item again and I'm going to fucking make the worst content I've ever made in my life.
[14:10.03]It's probably not a good idea.
[14:11.29]You don't play Diablo 4?
[14:13.45]Yeah.
[14:16.23]I mean, I don't know what I'm going to do with D4.
[14:25.37]I feel like D4 is going to be a game that I play just like on the couch.
[14:32.78]you're damn it you're the reason they're making these games so no what are you talking about couch diablo sacrilege why you're almost dead by the way I am room three yeah hey hey worry about yourself I have been and that's why I'm not taking so much damage
[15:01.16]uh um uh alright what did you say don't just pick up stuff I want to see what it does okay read it whenever you use a skill you throw a snowball at a random enemy that damages and freezes them and just fight damage and this one is your first skill on an ideal bonus damage um you don't have what do you do what do you have for a skill right now uh shield charge do you want the bonus damage
[15:27.17]Yeah.
[15:28.73]Okay.
[15:30.09]So now I am both fire and ice.
[15:34.31]You're an anime character.
[15:37.09]What was the last sentence that you just said before this?
[15:40.63]What were we just talking about?
[15:43.39]Diablo 4.
[15:44.45]Oh, you were talking about me playing on the couch.
[15:48.28]Oh, on the couch.
[15:48.90]Yeah, couch.
[15:49.66]So if I'm connected to a PC and I play Diablo 4 with a controller in my hand on the couch.
[15:54.30]I'm on PC, by the way.
[15:57.04]Does that make me a bad person?
[16:02.22]Yeah.
[16:02.86]Why?
[16:05.71]I just want the control scheme of the controller.
[16:07.77]I don't... That's all I want.
[16:09.59]I'm not... I just want the controller control scheme.
[16:12.15]It's totally valid, and if you want to do that, that's fine, but you're the reason the game's bad.
[16:18.78]No, no, I'm not.
[16:21.04]Like, if people like you didn't exist, they would have made a much better game.
[16:26.46]Oh, sorry.
[16:26.90]Oh, it was they were the same thing.
[16:29.22]Hey, if you want to compare ours and Diablo II, we can do that.
[16:39.25]You would win by a long shot.
[16:40.95]I was like, what?
[16:43.79]What?
[16:45.55]This guy's crazy.
[16:49.18]uh I like playing diablo with a controller well one specific reason because left clicking with my hand my hand can starts to hurt after a while after a long gaming session in diablo click click click click click click click click click click click click click my hand hurts
[17:07.95]I feel that.
[17:08.65]I only want it to be able to press X. That's it.
[17:12.20]Give me the PC version.
[17:14.80]I understand because Victor Vran was like a controller action RPG and it's a very good game.
[17:19.86]So you know what?
[17:20.58]I'm going to stop being such an elitist and I'm going to let you have the W. You could sit on your couch and you can play Diablo 4.
[17:29.19]Why not?
[17:29.73]There's no choices being made.
[17:31.29]There's nothing you need to do.
[17:33.93]Why shouldn't you be able to play it with a controller?
[17:38.58]It's annoying that I'm going to die before you right now because like what you're saying is like, like I have two health and you have 23.
[17:45.10]And if I die first, then everything you're saying is valid.
[17:47.88]Go fight them.
[17:49.25]You playing with a controller right now?
[17:54.21]Are you?
[17:59.27]Yeah.
[18:01.60]I'm on mouse and keyboard.
[18:04.48]Hold on.
[18:05.36]Point stands.
[18:07.20]No.
[18:07.78]Hold on a second.
[18:08.56]I'm defending this to the death.
[18:10.88]Okay.
[18:11.70]In the menu of the game, on the bottom left, it says, controller is recommended for the best experience.
[18:19.25]It literally says that.
[18:20.57]I win.
[18:21.53]Where does it say that?
[18:22.67]In the menu.
[18:23.75]Right at the bottom of the menu.
[18:28.12]well you got me there you and Ster should box I would drop them there's no way that's another thing like you know I was thinking of asking you to play diablo 4 and I know it would be a bad time and you know we should definitely box but like sometimes in my chat people like me and you should play guilty gear together and I'm like what's the fun in me just like destroying you
[18:50.17]Like, it's funny for like 30 seconds, and then we need to do something else.
[18:55.23]It'd be the same thing with boxing.
[18:56.98]Street Fighter VI seems like it's gonna be awesome, by the way.
[19:01.30]Does it?
[19:01.88]It does.
[19:03.75]Do you, what do you, how much do you know about Street Fighter six?
[19:07.27]I played the demo.
[19:08.15]I did the tutorial in the demo and I've been, I know that I want to play Maria.
[19:12.03]She's the big giant dummy mommy.
[19:14.11]And that's like the one thing that has me like still thinking that I might play the game.
[19:18.74]I don't really play fighting games with the one thing that's pulling me.
[19:20.86]There is the go and fight random pedestrians on the street.
[19:27.43]That part was crazy.
[19:29.45]They have a character creator.
[19:31.15]And you can make some really weird weirdos for sure.
[19:34.19]There's a part of that tutorial.
[19:36.45]I got the demo.
[19:37.11]I tried it.
[19:37.45]There's a part of that game that's just like, oh yeah, by the way, welcome to the open world.
[19:42.94]Everybody around you, you can just challenge them to a fight.
[19:46.42]And even like people on their cell phone just talking.
[19:49.10]You can go up and challenge them.
[19:50.84]and you just was that in a demo you just yeah you just fight like a regular person I missed all that you missed it okay you got to check that out I've seen it in the trailers but you know I missed it I only did like the the demo and then there was only ryu and Ken and then I was like okay where's my dummy mommy and I I closed it I'm gonna go poison
[20:16.71]You got one health, dude.
[20:17.93]I know, but we've been talking and shit.
[20:19.41]Come on.
[20:20.11]There's an inventory?
[20:21.73]I think we have to equip stuff.
[20:23.55]Or maybe not.
[20:26.87]I think it being in those slots is what... There's like a slot limit.
[20:32.03]Okay.
[20:34.35]I assume.
[20:35.41]Okay, be careful in this next room there, bud.
[20:42.04]Oh, I see.
[20:42.64]Okay, holding it.
[20:47.21]Watch out there, buddy.
[20:48.07]I didn't get hit.
[20:49.26]Watch out, pal.
[20:49.92]Watch your own screen.
[20:55.82]Boss next room, pal.
[21:00.78]Okay, pal.
[21:02.48]Alright there.
[21:03.31]It's a mini boss.
[21:06.55]Looks pretty big to me.
[21:07.45]Alright, you fight it.
[21:11.35]I'll be over here with the mushroom.
[21:13.33]Snake.
[21:22.31]That was chicken.
[21:23.23]Fuck.
[21:32.01]What's he doing?
[21:33.01]What's he doing?
[21:39.22]You have the chicken.
[21:39.84]We both have 11 health.
[21:46.18]What?
[21:46.42]I was behind him.
[21:47.30]He hit me.
[21:49.97]They cheated.
[21:51.22]They dashed forward and hit me behind him.
[21:53.34]Cheated.
[21:53.84]That was fun.
[21:57.30]The game feels pretty fluid.
[21:59.62]Yeah, it's pretty crunchy.
[22:00.42]Pretty cream cheesy.
[22:03.01]I can understand that.
[22:07.35]Finally.
[22:08.77]Help.
[22:11.19]Get these loiterers out of here.
[22:16.10]Wait.
[22:16.52]Oh, God.
[22:18.28]He's got bugs.
[22:22.53]What was the thing?
[22:25.51]I forget.
[22:26.49]What was the thing?
[22:27.43]Diablo 4.
[22:29.09]Diablo 4?
[22:32.51]You are, and I'm trying to be nice about this, but you probably are the biggest ARPG elitist I've ever met in my whole life.
[22:43.14]And I mean by a long shot, by an unbelievable amount.
[22:47.26]Thank you.
[22:48.33]I appreciate it.
[22:49.13]I put in a lot of hard work.
[22:52.17]How do you actually feel about D4?
[22:55.88]I feel like... I mean, absolutely no disrespect, by the way.
[23:01.02]I mean, you are very... That is the compliment.
[23:04.06]I've put a lot of time in being such...
[23:08.22]the guy uh I feel like it's it's way too simple there's no choices to making character creation and it's gonna get real boring real fast when you get to end game and you're just finding I oh my unique sword oh now I have to find the legendary sword of that exact same sword oh now I have to find the ancient sword like it's just I feel like it's just gonna be the same thing over and over again with no actual choices okay
[23:35.40]And I am going to wait until end game is available.
[23:44.65]I'm going to hold my opinion till then.
[23:49.17]Well, once you have to farm the third variant of unique status of your same weapon, then you let me know.
[23:57.16]And then, and then finally play PoE so you have something to actually compare it to.
[24:03.30]Or Torchlight Infinite.
[24:04.22]What was the whole rant that you went on that you said that like Titanfall hypnotized everybody to pretend that it was a good game or something?
[24:10.41]Titanfall?
[24:11.49]Didn't you say like Titanfall?
[24:12.69]Back when Titanfall came out, you were like, everybody thought it was great and you were like, I don't like it and it's not good.
[24:19.69]You said it was like, you said it was like, I don't think it was Titanfall.
[24:22.71]You said the Titanfall was like an illusion game or something, whatever it was.
[24:27.67]I've definitely said this.
[24:28.55]This was not my thing.
[24:30.11]They think it was Valorant.
[24:31.43]I think Titanfall 2 is one of the best games like FPS games ever.
[24:35.09]So I doubt I said that.
[24:36.55]I'm probably probably thinking of a different game.
[24:39.67]Um, Titanfall was good.
[24:40.59]I thought I thought Titanfall was good.
[24:41.53]I've said that about Vampire Survivors for sure.
[24:43.53]That's maybe what it was.
[24:44.57]So now I'm like pissed.
[24:49.27]Um,
[24:53.27]Titanfall.
[24:54.09]I don't know where you pulled Titanfall out of here.
[24:56.09]Where did Titanfall come from?
[24:58.83]We're talking about Vampire Survivors.
[25:00.45]It hypnotized everyone.
[25:02.15]No, no.
[25:03.33]I've also said this about Loop Hero.
[25:06.00]Absolutely nothing happens in Loop Hero.
[25:07.96]I'm telling you, you've said this before.
[25:10.94]Well, Loop Hero was a long time ago.
[25:12.90]And I probably said that about that as well.
[25:14.88]Let me see what I just got.
[25:19.38]This stuff's level 1.
[25:21.91]Loop Hero?
[25:22.43]I've never played it.
[25:24.19]You would fucking love Loop Hero, dude.
[25:26.67]Would I?
[25:28.09]If I'm saying it's a game that makes you think it's a game, you will love it.
[25:35.80]Can't you just like enjoy shit?
[25:39.46]I enjoy a lot of shit very passionately.
[25:42.14]That's why I'm saying that there's other things better that you could be spending your time on other than like Vampire Survivors.
[25:48.72]I will not let you sit here and talk about that game.
[25:51.88]Do you want to play a good game?
[25:53.02]Do you want to try a cool game I recommend?
[25:54.82]Oh, like Jade Cocoon?
[25:56.24]Do you want to play PoE?
[25:57.60]Yeah, dude, Jade Cocoon.
[25:58.88]Jade Cocoon is one of the rarest video games of all time.
[26:03.61]Is it?
[26:04.07]You can't find it anywhere.
[26:06.33]Did you actually look?
[26:07.25]Yeah, dude, I looked everywhere.
[26:08.95]That's a shame.
[26:12.09]Because everyone's holding on to it because it's such a little gem.
[26:19.70]It's a good series.
[26:20.38]Shut the fuck up.
[26:28.15]He doesn't know.
[26:29.09]Oh, I know what that reference is.
[26:32.21]Oh, you mean Little Gem.
[26:33.17]I thought you meant Jade Cocoon.
[26:35.85]Uh, Jade Cocoon 2 was the game that was available.
[26:39.11]And I remember I asked you, I said, Hey, dude, I can't find Jade Cocoon 1.
[26:43.71]Is Jade Cocoon 2 okay?
[26:45.48]I believe it was like $400.
[26:49.10]And you were like, no, dude, and that's the wrong one.
[26:52.04]Yeah, I never played it, but I heard Jade Cocoon 2 was terrible.
[26:55.32]Can somebody confirm that with me?
[26:58.86]They're expensive and they're rare.
[27:00.35]Alright, do you want a Gem of Wisdom or do you want something else?
[27:06.77]Or Gem of Power.
[27:07.89]Let's power up.
[27:09.03]Wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[27:11.35]I don't know what this is.
[27:12.09]2 is better.
[27:16.01]It's $60 on eBay.
[27:18.13]It was good.
[27:18.75]I guess I was... It's like 50 bucks.
[27:21.33]How much is Jade Cocoon 1?
[27:25.22]Did I just make that number up?
[27:26.22]I hope I didn't.
[27:27.24]That hurt.
[27:31.20]It's 100 bucks.
[27:45.34]$75.
[27:49.02]Okay, Ster, at what point is... How much percentage over something that's expensive is a complete overreaction?
[27:56.17]Like, what percentage-wise?
[27:59.35]Like, if I said, dude, it's like 500 bucks, and if it was like 200 bucks, is that still okay?
[28:06.43]I believe... I think that's pretty bad.
[28:12.03]Because you're saying, dude, it's five.
[28:13.69]You're saying it very confidently and very assertively and very aggressively.
[28:17.03]So it needs to be more accurate.
[28:18.39]The more you're like, if you're like, I think it's like 500.
[28:20.60]And if it was 200, that'd be okay.
[28:22.74]That's true.
[28:23.22]But you sound like you know what you're talking about.
[28:25.34]You really have no idea.
[28:26.32]Yeah, that's right.
[28:27.78]You're right.
[28:28.58]That's bad.
[28:30.28]That's bad.
[28:31.85]That's bad, dude.
[28:34.05]If I had been like, I think that game is expensive.
[28:38.05]I don't know.
[28:38.47]I'm not sure.
[28:40.97]But I got angry with you and told you it was $400.
[28:42.89]That's not even correct.
[28:47.23]I got angry and just, like, guessed higher.
[28:49.29]Do you get to pick a skill here, too?
[28:53.81]Are we both picking one?
[28:58.56]I think we both pick.
[29:01.82]Okay, it's the second... Yeah, yeah, okay, I pick and then you pick.
[29:13.92]I like that.
[29:17.38]Well, you're a little bit of a magician.
[29:20.24]Hey, let's get the hearts.
[29:21.52]Let's get the healing fountain.
[29:23.00]Wait, how do we... Is it the middle mouse?
[29:26.30]Okay, you're on controller.
[29:27.94]I don't know what my... The recommended way, by the way.
[29:30.62]Yeah, I know.
[29:33.86]Okay.
[29:34.80]So, dash over there.
[29:36.54]Healing spring?
[29:38.30]Oh.
[29:40.00]Oh, you're taking it all.
[29:41.49]Oh, whoops.
[29:48.66]I did not think it was going to do that.
[29:51.48]We've shared everything in the game so far.
[29:53.40]I figured we both could share that together.
[29:55.68]We've both been getting the same drops.
[29:58.44]That is true.
[29:59.68]Though the shop, you can only buy the same core item.
[30:11.33]Frozen.
[30:13.17]Frozen.
[30:15.85]Oh, you froze him.
[30:17.54]So let me practice this.
[30:19.14]Are you doing perfect?
[30:21.37]I don't know what that is.
[30:22.03]Okay, so when you hold down your ability, it's going to fill up that bar.
[30:27.57]You have to wait until it gets completely full, and you have to time it correctly to let go at the perfect time.
[30:33.07]And then it does more stuff.
[30:34.97]Just to let you know.
[30:35.81]Well, if you're practicing it, you're still consuming uses.
[30:41.55]Yeah, you'll get it.
[30:42.95]You're much more of a gamer than I am.
[30:52.78]I feel like I had a lot to talk about today.
[30:54.63]Like, I feel like there was a lot of things where I was like, you know what?
[30:57.26]I want to get his opinion on this.
[31:00.27]Like what?
[31:00.69]I don't know.
[31:01.29]You've asked me like one question.
[31:02.57]It'll come.
[31:02.85]I have a question.
[31:03.51]Yeah.
[31:05.73]As a reminder, not being weird today.
[31:07.89]What is your like deepest fantasy?
[31:10.69]And as a fantasy, I'm defining as something that you know will never happen.
[31:14.35]Riding on a... Okay, done.
[31:16.12]I got it.
[31:16.86]Riding on a roller coaster alone.
[31:19.34]Alone.
[31:19.90]Yeah, like having a theme park completely... Being able to go to like Disney World completely alone with like the live people.
[31:26.68]I feel like that could happen.
[31:28.14]It could really happen.
[31:29.52]I don't think so.
[31:37.91]Mine is a notebook where I've taken notes in it for a long time and every single page is perfectly filled up with the exact cool thing I wanted to write in it.
[31:48.59]there's like drawings to go along with it like if you look through the notebook and you go along like it's like immaculate perfect handwriting it's just like a joy to look at so how is that not achievable that's simply not it's how could how how could you do that so hire somebody
[32:06.64]Because, no, every time you, like, go to write a page of notes and you start, then, like, you realize, like, oh, I don't need to, like, I don't need to take notes on this anymore.
[32:14.80]Like, it's not as in-depth as I thought.
[32:16.96]Like, I'm over, like, you know.
[32:18.49]And then, like, every page doesn't line up with the page before it.
[32:21.19]Like, you're trying to get, like, a chronological set of notes.
[32:25.65]You know what I'm saying?
[32:26.65]I mean, you could compile a bunch of stuff and have somebody help you put it together and clean it up.
[32:31.55]There's a whole career about people doing that.
[32:35.59]It's literally impossible.
[32:36.63]It's like proofreading, copy reading, all kinds of stuff like that.
[32:44.68]Watch out, final phase.
[32:56.55]Ooh, he shut down.
[33:01.89]You were supposed to keep DPSing!
[33:03.59]I didn't die.
[33:05.50]You could also rent out an amusement park.
[33:19.19]Alright.
[33:20.75]I have a feeling that renting out Disney World for a week is probably going to cost millions of dollars.
[33:31.11]It doesn't need to be Disney World.
[33:32.63]I'm just saying, like, okay, well, then what's an amusement park?
[33:38.62]There's a water park near where I live, and they sell, like, the exclusive pass, like, skip the line.
[33:44.14]I was there nobody buys it there was a line of like 60 people for like a water slide nobody in the premium one and it's like it's like ten dollars more expensive oh it was crazy craziest thing I've ever seen in my life so it's basically like you're there alone like you just walk you get you get the satisfaction of walking past 60 people and just doing it as well
[34:12.05]Did I buy it?
[34:12.67]No, I was in line.
[34:14.73]Give it to me, please.
[34:15.25]Give it to me.
[34:15.55]But if I ever go again.
[34:17.25]Give it to me, please.
[34:18.91]Hey.
[34:21.27]That's because you lived on the boss because you didn't know the rules.
[34:24.39]I dodged the most enemy attacks, too, by the way.
[34:28.05]I also dealt all the damage.
[34:31.27]What else did I do?
[34:32.55]Oh, you ate all the food.
[34:34.54]Good for you.
[34:35.00]I'm dying.
[34:42.34]I killed more enemies yeah it's called last hitting okay I'm stepping it up oh yeah do you really want to make this like a whole like a whole thing one of my biggest fantasies just came true right there I beat Ster in a video game no we both had two stars
[35:11.33]Oh shit, now I know that I have to actually care now.
[35:13.50]Because I don't want you to get any rings.
[35:18.56]Shit.
[35:19.58]Yeah, you're playing now too.
[35:20.76]Hmm.
[35:32.14]Armor's always good.
[35:33.32]Yeah, I'm going armor.
[35:46.04]yeah I'm going with this more skill damage so I do one and then the other back to back apparently we got a buff in the horn I hate these sound effects it's like dial up yeah I feel like oh
[36:10.91]so esper actually summoned you I would have expected him to perish from old age before actually making a move cringe this is the first time I've seen an Ember Knight the defenders of the nexus thanks for telling me what I am is that supposed to be a joke a sneeze could blow you away oh dude it's hardly worth the effort but I'll give you something to play with cringe
[36:39.93]No, you go ahead.
[36:41.31]No, you do it.
[36:43.55]This is the only miniscule portion of my power.
[36:46.53]Try not to break too quickly.
[36:48.54]Yeah, I could do it too.
[36:49.64]Yeah, you can.
[36:51.96]Pretty good at it.
[36:57.16]We gotta destroy his power crystal!
[37:02.20]Oh fuck, I died.
[37:11.72]I was being a fucking idiot and just... I don't know.
[37:14.24]I had fun.
[37:14.64]Doesn't matter.
[37:15.82]Oh.
[37:16.56]Defeat mini boss to revive you.
[37:20.40]That wasn't the mini boss?
[37:23.90]Okay.
[37:24.72]Well, I hope you like watching.
[37:29.86]What?
[37:30.98]I was just like... I was mashing X and doing like a wicked weird face.
[37:35.54]I don't know.
[37:36.14]I thought it was fun.
[37:38.68]You seem to be in a mood today.
[37:39.94]Yeah.
[37:43.73]Sometimes.
[37:47.55]Sometimes.
[37:48.87]Don't worry, I'll get you back, pal.
[37:56.13]Wish I could pick those up.
[38:03.62]This is a roguelike.
[38:04.62]Be careful.
[38:05.81]I'm aware.
[38:06.88]I'm aware you don't want to die.
[38:08.40]On the right side.
[38:13.40]Right side.
[38:13.68]Okay, where do I go now?
[38:19.53]Use your 1 more.
[38:20.71]You're using it not that often.
[38:22.41]I'm using it pretty often.
[38:25.95]Doors up here.
[38:27.35]Doors up here.
[38:28.73]Using my 1.
[38:40.92]Oh, what?
[38:41.72]Those things... Oh, these icicles randomly explode.
[38:43.72]Yeah, the icicles hurt when you touch them.
[38:45.48]Yeah, the icicles hurt.
[38:46.88]You can't dodge through them.
[38:47.94]And the door's over on the left side, by the way.
[38:49.68]You're kind of fighting in a weird spot.
[38:52.38]Okay.
[38:53.60]That's good advice.
[38:55.80]It's fine, because all the healing items are for me now.
[38:59.50]Left side.
[39:00.02]Yep, there you go.
[39:01.46]There's more than one door.
[39:14.03]Anybody that comes to stream right now doesn't even know you're here.
[39:17.75]We're getting a Five Nights at Freddy's watch stream and we're getting the Ember Knight watch stream.
[39:23.32]I don't think people understand just how much I've been looking forward to that Five Nights at Freddy's watch along.
[39:28.44]There's many bosses far away.
[39:30.16]Dude, that was like the first room.
[39:33.02]Yeah, you have to go.
[39:33.96]I think you're going to get all the stars too and it's going to piss me off.
[39:38.60]Yeah, make sure you don't skip that stream.
[39:54.43]Oh, dude.
[39:54.99]Oh, dude.
[39:55.47]Oh, someone's getting some move speed.
[39:56.85]Level up.
[39:57.89]Yeah, level up.
[40:02.59]Another.
[40:11.21]Ow.
[40:19.76]They did damage.
[40:20.62]Make a funny voice.
[40:21.64]No.
[40:27.50]Can you announce the date for more sorcery?
[40:30.77]He's doing it tomorrow, he told me in private.
[40:32.59]That was going to be a huge fucking surprise.
[40:39.01]Dude, he's circled.
[40:45.72]That was going to be a huge surprise.
[40:48.18]Now I don't even have the motivation to do it again tomorrow.
[40:52.86]He just took all the motivation from me.
[40:53.98]That was going to be a surprise to my community.
[40:57.05]I apologize.
[40:59.79]Maybe you'll play a cool game instead.
[41:02.91]I need to have some room in between now, I think.
[41:05.43]It'd be a lot easier with, like, another guy.
[41:09.94]Yeah, it would be.
[41:14.56]You got this, though.
[41:15.20]You're doing fine.
[41:15.72]There's no DK barrel that you can just pick up and throw and I can jump out of it.
[41:30.91]Wait, these are locked?
[41:32.11]I have to actually swap something out now?
[41:36.35]Wait, why is it showing me... It's showing me stat upgrade for me, but it's making me choose from your combo meal body?
[41:44.51]I'm confused.
[41:45.63]I don't know.
[41:47.23]When I get revived, can we do the thing that they do in Donkey Kong Country?
[41:51.45]Where I go...
[42:00.07]You can do whatever you want, but personally, I love monkeys.
[42:04.91]Those of you that get it, you get it.
[42:09.38]Those of you that don't, sorry.
[42:11.20]I don't like these enemies.
[42:21.29]So true, I agree.
[42:22.37]Yeah.
[42:23.83]so true bestie mini boss time you better kill it uh I got no health
[43:06.97]I'm just chilling.
[43:10.45]Jesus.
[43:15.66]Yeah, I bet this is easier when there's two guys to kill these.
[43:18.14]Hells on the left, hells on the left.
[43:27.50]Hey, you handle the adds.
[43:28.70]I'll do the boss.
[43:29.48]Yeah.
[43:36.31]I got items.
[43:47.58]You're doing fine.
[43:48.34]You got this.
[43:52.52]I got this.
[44:07.49]nice alright get up karma nice stand up let's go for it oh spawns are the same health as me nice let's go for it now let's like go in the shop and like over gear you you know what I mean do you need this I don't think I can use it
[44:37.57]What?
[44:37.73]Do you need this?
[44:38.87]I don't think I can use it.
[44:42.11]Hello?
[44:42.43]Is that even coming through to you?
[44:44.81]No.
[44:45.31]Oh, never mind.
[44:47.36]What was it?
[44:48.24]I was recording.
[44:50.28]Oh, alright.
[44:51.18]So you got a lot more money than I do.
[45:00.43]Ooh, I'll take it.
[45:01.23]I'll take that.
[45:04.09]Can you buy something for me?
[45:06.49]Um, I just spent a lot of money.
[45:08.00]I don't have money for these now.
[45:10.38]Okay.
[45:11.48]I unfortunately used it on myself.
[45:15.37]Watch out.
[45:15.75]These enemies are tough.
[45:29.86]Watch out, dude.
[45:36.14]Dude, great work.
[45:36.96]If I come back and beat you in damage.
[45:39.61]How could that possibly happen?
[45:41.51]Anything is possible.
[45:42.17]But I killed a whole mini boss by myself.
[45:59.46]You know what?
[45:59.78]I believe in you.
[46:00.90]If anyone can do it, it's you.
[46:07.65]I think we're actually doing really well.
[46:08.91]I mean, this is our first run ever.
[46:11.71]We're at the end of stage two soon.
[46:14.04]Let's take a stab.
[46:16.14]You don't want the healing fountain?
[46:20.58]I mean, yeah, let's do that.
[46:23.10]You could use it.
[46:25.71]I feel like we probably should have taken the gem because the boss room seemed to also always heal you beforehand.
[46:30.06]I think we can go to full.
[46:33.96]Yeah, we should have taken the gem.
[46:35.20]Is there like a greater of an advocacy?
[46:40.24]Um, I don't know.
[46:55.78]I don't think so.
[46:56.32]Alright, Gemma, can we just take a quick second to see what do the stats do?
[47:06.73]Agility was 10% move speed.
[47:09.05]Precision is crit chance or something.
[47:10.89]Okay.
[47:14.67]So, crit chance?
[47:23.96]Jare spoiled it so we didn't get the announcement.
[47:26.94]Oh, wait.
[47:27.58]People think that was real.
[47:29.44]It wasn't.
[47:33.26]What was the announcement?
[47:36.85]I didn't hear it.
[47:38.23]That I wasn't going to play Sorcery.
[47:42.45]Oh.
[47:43.03]You've already beat all of them like six times?
[47:48.15]Have you ever played Sorcery?
[47:50.34]yeah you did right yeah beat the first one you didn't do this I I might have done like half of the second one I can't remember second one's the best one I feel like stirred now would appreciate that game a lot more what do you think maybe I mean I liked it when I played it I I honestly can't remember why I stopped
[48:18.60]Not that Ster back years ago wouldn't have, but... I feel like that game is right up your alley in your current... My current form?
[48:28.10]Your current form.
[48:38.99]maybe yeah maybe I try it yeah maybe we play peewee together or not together you yeah but you whatever yeah whatever why are you so loud very loud maybe you spend the 500 brigade cocoon what is this what's going on oh god yeah see it always heals and now we like we have like full health already we shouldn't have done it
[49:09.84]First person to get hit loses.
[49:12.48]First person to get hit loses.
[49:14.32]Okay.
[49:20.95]I knew you were going to just go walk and stand in the corner.
[49:26.53]You can play at that game and my character can actually go invisible.
[49:31.97]I'm pretty ranged.
[49:48.77]Wait, I'm invisible!
[49:49.79]Yes!
[49:53.57]Yeah, you need like a cheap way to win right now because you were dead for the whole stage.
[50:10.28]What?
[50:15.70]Watch out for his ice attack.
[50:36.45]Watch out for his ice.
[50:43.59]Watch out.
[50:44.23]He's invincible.
[50:44.79]Watch out for the sword.
[50:56.70]Dude, you just froze the ice king.
[51:00.08]That's insane.
[51:01.12]That's true.
[51:06.99]Oh.
[51:16.86]Yeah, TPS time.
[51:17.72]If you're going to beat me, it's now.
[51:21.14]Nice.
[51:21.94]I want to see these stats.
[51:22.92]Oh, shit.
[51:24.48]What?
[51:25.08]Shit yourself?
[51:25.58]I got liquid all over me.
[51:29.70]Do you want those?
[51:38.46]Every time I take a sip out of my drink, it's like way over here.
[51:41.72]Because I hate it when it's in the way of my other monitor.
[51:44.20]So I have to like...
[51:45.66]crowds creep over here drink out of my drink I turned like a goblin when I go take a sip alright what do you want do you want this um you should probably take it it's weird that the bosses only give one power up and everything else like duplicates it for us you look like luigi luigi's cool luigi is the cooler brother
[52:17.01]Okay.
[52:21.02]But being Luigi is not cool?
[52:26.92]New outfit.
[52:28.92]Wow.
[52:35.27]Mario is categorically better.
[52:37.61]Who's it gonna be?
[52:38.67]Oh, I hope it's me.
[52:40.87]It's gonna be... Okay.
[52:45.32]Perceive the most damage.
[52:46.76]Oh, got hit too many times, looks like.
[52:54.33]Is it pretty good?
[52:58.82]I was dead the whole entire level.
[53:01.02]That's pretty good for coming back in the first... Dying in the first room and then coming back in the last room.
[53:07.29]You have the spectator badge.
[53:09.07]I've never got that before.
[53:10.61]That's crazy.
[53:11.15]Alright, this one's now the real one.
[53:13.51]Our damage taken is actually one damage apart.
[53:20.08]Yeah, that's weird.
[53:21.90]That must be a bug.
[53:32.90]I think when Early Access came out, this was the end of the game, this stage.
[53:36.81]So I vaguely remember seeing someone play it.
[53:41.03]How long has this been in Early Access for?
[53:43.73]I think it's been a year.
[53:44.95]Not 100% sure.
[53:46.27]That's pretty good.
[53:50.32]An Early Access game that was in Early Access for like a year?
[53:58.07]yeah yeah yeah that's pretty good that's pretty good it seems like a pretty good turnaround what's wrong I got hit yeah we also oh this is me uh poisons them aren't you poisoning people uh I am so I should probably take it I already apparently you like level one to level two I already have that
[54:30.97]I like that.
[54:34.23]I also have fire.
[54:34.99]I have to replace something though, don't I?
[54:43.04]Um, I don't know.
[54:43.70]I don't know if you get the second row.
[54:47.06]You do, okay.
[54:50.90]Yep.
[54:53.46]Wow.
[54:53.82]We are the Ember Knights.
[55:05.17]Dude, you know what game is coming out that I... I'm sorry, I'm talking and getting hit.
[55:08.55]You know what game is coming out that I completely forgot existed and I cannot wait to play this game?
[55:13.78]What?
[55:14.52]The Golem Lord of the Rings game.
[55:17.87]I don't even know about that.
[55:19.79]That's coming out in like a week.
[55:23.74]I can't wait to play that game.
[55:25.34]You have to play as Gollum.
[55:27.37]You play as Gollum.
[55:28.45]It's a third-person action stealth game?
[55:31.41]I don't know.
[55:32.65]Who is it made by?
[55:33.63]I fucking died because I'm talking.
[55:35.85]Dude, I'm just talking.
[55:36.93]I can't... Man, so... So, maybe I let them kill me.
[55:48.46]No, no, no.
[55:49.76]We need to continue.
[55:50.80]Here, you get to keep talking now.
[55:54.53]Tell me about this game.
[55:56.19]It's a game where you play as Gollum, and it looks kind of fucked up.
[56:00.97]It just doesn't... I don't know.
[56:01.81]I don't even know what to think about it.
[56:03.03]I don't even know who made it.
[56:05.75]I just know that it exists.
[56:07.71]And it's just... He's crawling around.
[56:10.32]He's just crawling around like this.
[56:12.94]Wait, wait.
[56:13.26]Who is it made by?
[56:14.00]I don't know.
[56:14.88]Save it.
[56:21.36]That's not a real game.
[56:22.40]Yeah, it is.
[56:23.86]I'm telling you, it's a real game.
[56:26.18]Stop talking out your ass.
[56:27.71]No, the whole trailer for the Gollum game is a bunch of close-ups of his face going like this.
[56:37.11]And then it shows him crawling over shit.
[56:39.29]I'm going to have a lot of fun with that game.
[56:42.73]Just you wait.
[56:47.21]Every 10 to 20 seconds in that trailer, it goes like this.
[56:53.77]zooms in on his face almost got hit like trying to look at your stream which I don't even have open to see what the face was you gotta scream it the day it comes out uh well I don't know about that we'll see
[57:18.89]Am I going to be the only... No, there's no way I'm not the only day one Golem Lord of the Rings stream.
[57:26.09]That's not going to happen.
[57:27.41]That's how many people are going to play this.
[57:28.85]Why wouldn't they?
[57:29.45]It's like a big franchise.
[57:30.65]I'm going to die out here, champ.
[57:34.11]Well, it's a roguelike.
[57:35.09]I don't think we're supposed to beat it on the first try.
[57:38.75]Yes, you are.
[57:40.51]Oh, right.
[57:41.48]Ster is going to be very upset if we can't...
[57:46.95]Ster hates progress.
[57:48.33]Ster hates resetting in progress.
[57:50.13]He hates it.
[57:50.55]What are you talking about?
[57:53.01]Ster does not like when a game forces you to have to start over and progress.
[57:58.33]Distinctly, I don't like when you die and then it gives you 700% bonus damage and then three extra lives.
[58:05.00]There's a difference.
[58:08.04]I like restarting.
[58:10.08]My identity is restarting.
[58:19.34]Dude, I don't want any of these.
[58:20.26]Do you have a golem cosplay?
[58:22.99]Just, like, put grease in my hair and have it come down like this.
[58:26.79]And just, like, I don't know, make myself look all... Hey!
[58:30.20]Exactly why I should never have shaved.
[58:31.62]I have no shirt on and just...
[58:48.52]Raw fish.
[58:58.85]Isn't it funny that when you know you only have less than 10 health, that's when you actually care more than anything?
[59:04.67]Yeah, I don't know how my armor works.
[59:06.61]The 14 armor I have, is that just damage reduction?
[59:08.77]I was hoping that would be like extra life.
[59:13.29]Shop!
[59:14.51]Game is saved.
[59:15.07]Golem impression the whole time?
[59:17.73]No healing.
[59:19.47]Whenever you crit, heal.
[59:20.51]Game's over.
[59:22.69]Wait, what is it?
[59:23.85]Whenever I crit, I heal.
[59:37.51]Could you just talk like that forever?
[59:39.09]You just, like... I don't want Jerma anymore.
[59:42.97]I want to play with Golem.
[59:48.44]That was cow from cow and chicken.
[59:50.10]I guess they're one and the same.
[59:54.63]I never thought about it.
[60:03.40]Chicken?
[60:05.00]That's me, cow.
[60:07.76]It kind of is a little.
[60:13.52]If I really tried, I might be able to do it.
[60:17.66]Oh, that's Charlie Adler, the voice actor.
[60:21.97]One of the most talented human beings to ever live.
[60:25.17]Did almost every voice on that show.
[60:28.17]If you didn't know.
[60:33.43]I didn't know.
[60:44.92]I gained 19 health that room from hitting things.
[60:48.26]I don't think people understand just how much influence red guy had on my entire life.
[60:54.59]Who's red guy?
[60:55.47]Cow and chicken?
[60:58.45]I hated that show, so I kind of remember him.
[61:03.59]I'm sorry.
[61:04.93]I know, like, you're telling us about your, like, formative childhood years and, like, what meant the most to you, and I didn't like it.
[61:11.35]And I know that I don't like... Oster doesn't like something else, but, like, Cow and Chicken... You don't like anything.
[61:18.56]I didn't, like... Your top cartoons growing up.
[61:21.30]Top.
[61:21.68]Like, give me, like, a top three.
[61:25.84]That's, like... I don't even know if I could do that.
[61:31.00]Top... Ugh.
[61:34.91]Okay.
[61:35.55]I have to think about this.
[61:37.73]I did a Cartoon Network Top Shows quiz thing on stream a while ago, so I'm prepped for this.
[61:45.63]Okay.
[61:46.85]But it was specifically Cartoon Network.
[61:49.53]What good shows did Nickelodeon even have?
[61:51.75]Oh, stop.
[61:52.51]What are you talking about?
[61:53.37]Doug?
[61:55.73]You didn't like Doug?
[61:56.57]What?
[61:56.99]How does that hit me?
[61:58.13]This game sucks.
[61:59.49]Fuck that.
[62:01.11]I'm behind him.
[62:03.57]Yeah, you were saying Doug?
[62:04.75]I didn't like Doug that much.
[62:05.37]You didn't like Doug?
[62:07.69]What about Rugrats?
[62:08.65]Doug, Rugrats, Ren and Stimpy.
[62:11.31]Um... This is not a cartoon, but Salute Your Shorts?
[62:15.81]That show was... Come on!
[62:19.01]SpongeBob?
[62:21.53]You don't like SpongeBob?
[62:23.11]SpongeBob's okay.
[62:24.17]Hey Arnold?
[62:24.67]Ren and Stimpy was good.
[62:26.01]Ren and Stimpy should not have been on TV.
[62:27.87]Rocko's Modern Life?
[62:31.12]Did you like Rocko?
[62:31.62]I didn't like that either.
[62:32.30]I didn't like Rocko.
[62:32.96]Why?
[62:36.46]I can't believe it.
[62:37.16]I don't know.
[62:37.98]Cartoon Network was just better.
[62:39.42]Okay, top three.
[62:40.79]We got to compare top threes, not like what I don't like.
[62:43.71]Because if I do a top three and it's the things that I did like, then people will be like, Ster, base pilled, and true fact.
[62:49.43]And if I tell you all the things I don't like, then I'm a loser.
[62:52.71]Shit.
[62:53.05]Okay.
[62:56.67]Favorite cartoon growing up?
[63:12.21]Like, open your stream and see how deep in thought you are.
[63:16.26]That's got to be the Looney Tunes.
[63:17.48]It has to be.
[63:19.98]That makes a lot of sense.
[63:20.90]It has to be the Looney Tunes.
[63:24.00]And that's not even... That's completely disconnected.
[63:27.72]I honestly... The old Looney Tunes routines are some of the most engaging, some of the most fun.
[63:32.99]The Roadrunner.
[63:34.43]I think that Wile E. Coyote in Roadrunner is probably some of my favorite media ever.
[63:42.82]So there you go.
[63:46.47]Tom and Jerry was, I liked it, but I liked Daffy and Bugs' bullshit that they would do back and forth.
[63:54.15]So your top three is Looney Tunes.
[63:56.46]Well, I just gave you one.
[63:58.52]It's honestly probably Rugrats.
[64:00.14]I loved Rugrats.
[64:00.90]It was just such a... What the fuck?
[64:03.54]Rugrats, well, I wouldn't put it in top three.
[64:06.46]Rugrats, I loved Rugrats.
[64:07.42]How could you not like Rugrats?
[64:09.75]It was a great show.
[64:10.92]A top three?
[64:12.78]Especially because I'm... Ren and Stimpy has to be up there too.
[64:16.76]It has to be.
[64:18.92]Ashley tells me all the time about how Rugrats is the ugliest show ever made.
[64:22.60]And her as an artist, I hear about it a lot.
[64:24.62]She's not wrong.
[64:26.48]They're fucking disgusting looking.
[64:28.64]Hey, you're talking about the Class Geek Supo style.
[64:31.18]Come on.
[64:33.62]I like the one episode where one of the kids is having a fever dream.
[64:40.32]That was about it.
[64:43.21]Class Geek Supo were... It was a... They had a studio.
[64:47.09]It was a... I think it was... I'm trying to remember correctly.
[64:50.13]You're a Supo.
[64:51.94]It was two names.
[64:53.30]It was a certain style.
[64:56.40]It was... Did Class Geek Supo do...
[65:02.94]Uh, what the hell?
[65:03.66]What the hell?
[65:04.12]What the hell?
[65:05.60]Rocket Power?
[65:07.10]Was Class Geek Supo?
[65:09.56]They're just as ugly.
[65:11.30]Stop it.
[65:11.76]I imagine so.
[65:13.02]They did, um, Wild Thornberries?
[65:16.16]Was Class Geek Supo, right?
[65:19.36]Did you like the Wild Thornberries?
[65:21.82]No.
[65:22.00]Okay.
[65:24.65]I think, like, Nigel is funny for, like, a little bit to just hear him talk, and that was about it.
[65:30.47]Okay.
[65:33.18]alright it's probably all the old Looney Tunes combined with the x-men cartoon I would say that's probably number two or three the old x-men cartoon I know but still the one where wolverine's looking at the picture in bed
[65:58.88]Why is that the one thing that you have from this whole entire series?
[66:03.06]Because that's the one meme.
[66:05.14]It's the meme.
[66:06.66]I remember like one other episode that got dubbed over with Juggernaut.
[66:10.16]That's it.
[66:10.72]The Batman animated series was up there as well.
[66:14.77]Probably three.
[66:17.01]Spongebob.
[66:18.43]First three or four seasons of Spongebob.
[66:20.65]First five seasons of Spongebob.
[66:22.41]Get out of here.
[66:23.17]Get out of town.
[66:30.72]If you want to go even further than that, we got some of the Adult Swim stuff.
[66:34.94]Aqua Teen.
[66:35.60]Aqua Teen Hunger Force.
[66:37.96]That's the first smart thing you've said all day.
[66:40.10]Oh, please.
[66:43.46]Aqua Teen was awesome.
[66:44.70]Adventure Brothers was good.
[66:53.32]Yeah, but that's not... They're not part of this.
[66:55.61]You know what I mean?
[66:56.17]Like, they're animes.
[66:56.59]Why not?
[66:58.08]That's like if I ask you what your favorite cartoon is and you say like One Punch Man.
[67:06.25]How is that unfair?
[67:08.71]Alright.
[67:09.13]Are we going back to the main menu?
[67:10.74]I feel like we're staying in the category of like daytime TV cartoons.
[67:17.07]Well, but you have to give me criteria.
[67:18.13]And then when you bring in, like, oh, my favorite cartoon was One Punch Man.
[67:21.56]That's weird.
[67:22.86]Well, then you have to give me some parameters to work in.
[67:26.20]We're just working within the parameters of, like, daytime TV cartoons.
[67:29.34]Then it's got to be X-Men animated series, Batman animated series, Rugrats, Doug, Ren and Stimpy, Cow and Chicken, like, some of those, like, Johnny Bravo.
[67:41.36]I'm just trying to think of that era.
[67:42.58]Like, I watched Looney Tunes.
[67:43.47]I watched them all.
[67:47.57]CatDog is another one.
[67:49.22]Classic.
[67:51.84]Invader Zim I did not really catch or care about until much later.
[67:55.78]So I can't say that.
[67:59.72]I'm not coping.
[68:00.52]I'm setting the parameters.
[68:02.82]There's no opinion in setting the parameter.
[68:05.59]Ah, Real Monsters was also Class Geek Supo.
[68:08.51]So did you like that one?
[68:10.87]No.
[68:13.31]No.
[68:14.43]It was okay, but like...
[68:20.49]You know?
[68:21.39]It's just okay.
[68:22.77]I just don't think you liked the Class Geek Zupo style.
[68:27.14]Did you not like the art style?
[68:29.70]It has to be what it is.
[68:31.40]I think Unreal Monsters works a bit because they're all supposed to be ugly.
[68:35.64]Okay, well, what is your top five, top ten cartoons that you've watched and cared about?
[68:43.84]I can't believe not even brought up at all, like Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[68:49.03]for real but this guy's hell wait a minute even care about ed and eddie you think that our real monsters is ugly and all those I don't like the ugly art styles and I don't like the weird kind of way ed and eddie had a wild art style they're almost the same wasn't ugly it wasn't ugly no it's not the same it was it was very close to that kind of old klasky supo style yes it was
[69:14.34]Ed, Edd, and Eddy would fit in the same category as Class King Supo.
[69:18.16]And it's great.
[69:18.94]I liked it.
[69:19.40]I just don't think I'd put it in my top five.
[69:24.40]Alright.
[69:24.76]Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[69:25.60]Let's get another one.
[69:27.28]Hold on.
[69:27.68]We have like items.
[69:28.84]We can still purchase more things here if you didn't from the shrine.
[69:32.16]Oh.
[69:32.66]I was like reading that we can start with like twice the amount of health that we started with last time.
[69:38.28]That's pretty good.
[69:42.94]and there's like three different tiers of it so should we unlock this I'm unlocking this one we don't share these points right uh no so you like unlock the first one and then the other ones purchase three more upgrades to unlock the other stuff and then even press e you can respec everything anytime it seems I'm just doing health and money
[70:10.89]Yeah, see, this is why it's a roguelike.
[70:12.99]Look, now we have, look at how much health we have.
[70:17.89]Okay, so Ed, Edd, and Eddy.
[70:20.84]Uh, Grim Adventures, Billy and Mandy.
[70:23.22]Yep, that's, that's a good one.
[70:30.48]Um, I forget what was, what else was on there?
[70:34.62]Oh my god, how did I, how did I screw this up?
[70:37.14]I can't believe it.
[70:37.82]All the, uh, Donald Duck.
[70:39.34]All the old Disney stuff.
[70:40.79]Donald Duck?
[70:42.87]You like, you like... Yeah.
[70:45.09]For like an hour?
[70:45.85]The old Donald Duck cartoons.
[70:48.05]He, I, I love the old Donald Duck cartoons.
[70:52.76]Donald Duck would just like fucking lose his shit.
[70:55.78]He would, somebody would just, Donald Duck had a really fucking challenging life.
[71:01.63]Something bad happened to Donald Duck every episode.
[71:04.63]I don't understand why everyone's like, oh wow, I can't believe Donald Duck's got such a temper.
[71:07.55]Yeah, he gets fucked with every episode.
[71:10.00]Horrible fucking things happen to him every single day.
[71:11.96]I think I'd be a little upset too.
[71:20.93]Yeah, the old Disney stuff too.
[71:23.19]Donald Duck especially.
[71:24.85]Flapjack.
[71:26.96]That's a good one.
[71:29.52]Boys in the bow.
[71:30.72]Wait a minute, maybe.
[71:33.90]Stand in the back and use the bow.
[71:38.84]It actually does not go that far.
[71:42.58]That's a. Might be hard to use, but I'll try it.
[71:47.30]I believe in you.
[71:48.70]I'm going to.
[71:49.00]I'm going to say sword guy, OK?
[71:52.97]Alright, so is that would you consider that to be an accurate playlist?
[71:59.32]I'm confident in saying edit and Eddie and grim adventures are like top two.
[72:04.41]They could even share the same place.
[72:05.83]I don't care.
[72:06.23]Okay.
[72:07.33]And then third, I don't, I don't really know.
[72:09.51]Like team Titans was pretty, pretty good.
[72:11.69]I like flapjack.
[72:12.89]I like chowder, but I don't feel as strongly about them as the top two.
[72:17.91]Okay.
[72:23.25]I, I remember I,
[72:28.06]Teen Titans confused me a lot because I didn't really pay that much attention to it.
[72:32.76]But I caught an episode of it and they have a different series now.
[72:39.02]It's like Teen Titans Go.
[72:42.16]I've heard it's good.
[72:43.24]I haven't seen any of it.
[72:45.22]The episodes that I watched of regular Teen Titans was good.
[72:49.71]I don't like I have anything against it.
[72:51.99]I thought it was a good show.
[72:54.13]I didn't really.
[72:56.25]But I saw that they came with it.
[72:57.45]I didn't know if it was the same thing or not.
[73:00.53]Well, that's because you had to be into it.
[73:03.19]You had to be shipping Raven and Beast Boy.
[73:10.75]If you weren't doing that, then were you really even watching it?
[73:13.23]I looked it up for your chat.
[73:30.27]It's like the most controversial thing I've ever said.
[73:34.39]Bro is flabbergasted.
[73:40.57]are their kids their teams for one and I'm not saying I will oh dude I want it to be in the middle no I'm like I would just be happy for raven and beast alright stop talking moving on okay I don't like these I'm gonna take that what do I take Jerma what do I do here
[74:09.58]Take Frost Wall.
[74:10.54]It'll help us.
[74:13.02]Will it?
[74:15.02]Yeah.
[74:16.40]An Ice Barrier?
[74:19.73]You take it then.
[74:21.27]Can you drop items?
[74:22.87]Because Knight's Charge was so good.
[74:25.67]And you've got a bow.
[74:27.13]I'll give you the Chakram if we could.
[74:29.57]I wanted Frost Wall so bad.
[74:31.96]I wanted Frost Wall so bad.
[74:33.64]I'm taking it.
[74:44.73]Okay, chat, chat.
[74:46.73]Just like dive into this a little bit first.
[74:48.11]Are you telling me that you want it fucking, what was it, Beast Boy and Terra?
[74:52.21]I'm going to go wash my windows.
[74:54.11]I'll be back.
[74:54.69]And Terra.
[74:55.51]That shit was so fucking lame.
[74:57.91]I don't even know what he's talking about.
[74:59.49]But I know, I feel like I have to cut his mic.
[75:00.75]I don't even know who he's talking about.
[75:02.47]Should I cut his mic?
[75:03.47]I'll be back.
[75:03.83]Back in like an hour.
[75:05.25]He's talking about a TV show.
[75:11.07]Okay.
[75:11.91]To be clear, are you muting me?
[75:13.34]No, you're here.
[75:15.22]okay wait are we you're okay you're actually I thought you were actually getting up to go do something I know you have like the old person thing where you have to like pee every 20 seconds apparently I do feel like
[75:42.80]says something unhinged Jerm of praise is that what this says Jerma praise what I thought it said true praise pretends he didn't hear him oh pray like you started I thought I was like oh I thought it said that I from praying oh lord I told you I'm not even being weird today these are like normal people opinions a lot of people agree
[76:14.09]Okay.
[76:15.19]Can you pick your item, please?
[76:20.23]I don't know.
[76:22.05]Is there a description of how poison works?
[76:28.38]I feel like you're the kind of like coward who would use poison.
[76:32.88]Like if I ever die from poison, it was probably you.
[76:36.32]I'm not taking it.
[76:37.10]You can take some poison shit.
[76:39.04]Poison is guaranteed damage when you know that you can't be there to do it.
[76:45.90]Tick damage is so huge.
[76:48.71]Affliction Warlock was one of the best classes in all of World of Warcraft.
[76:52.50]You know why?
[76:52.94]Why?
[76:56.94]Because the dot damage, you can just walk away and you could just dodge mechanics and not actually focus on like contributing.
[77:02.46]Actually, that is a huge deal because you can pay attention to the encounter and not worry about, not worry about, you know, don't stand in the shit as they say, right?
[77:10.29]Don't stand in the thing.
[77:11.05]You could pay attention much easier.
[77:12.71]Is that your favorite WoW build of all time?
[77:15.15]You identify as a Affliction Warlock?
[77:18.35]Affliction Warlock was awesome.
[77:21.71]Not anymore.
[77:22.22]I don't.
[77:22.96]Cookie Clicker gameplay.
[77:26.60]Yeah, sorry.
[77:27.64]Let's just go.
[77:29.12]Okay.
[77:31.21]Doesn't work.
[77:49.76]The bow is pretty good.
[77:53.49]It seems good.
[77:54.85]It seems good.
[77:55.67]It seems good.
[78:01.87]When was the last time you actually played Affliction Warlock?
[78:05.11]I don't know, dude.
[78:05.65]Like 2000?
[78:05.79]Whatever year it was?
[78:20.56]I can't relate to this wow talk.
[78:22.48]I'm not a wower.
[78:23.25]I feel like this doesn't do that much damage though.
[78:31.23]Are you getting the perfect?
[78:33.11]I think so.
[78:37.72]Yeah, yeah, it doesn't look like it is doing.
[78:40.06]I mean, like Pierce's targets.
[78:41.26]That seems really good.
[78:55.92]I think if you do perfects in a row, it's better.
[79:00.35]Oh, that sounds... Perfect taps five?
[79:04.83]Alright, I gotta be good.
[79:09.11]Is this the stream he said he was going to do where he's going to ditch, Ster, and play Breath of the Wild?
[79:13.93]Um... I didn't have a plan to do that.
[79:19.54]Precision or power?
[79:20.28]Power.
[79:21.06]I can't remember what power did, but I want to get it.
[79:32.08]Watch out.
[79:34.34]Watch out there, pal.
[79:37.51]Damage plus three.
[79:38.95]Holy... What?
[79:43.79]They're just handing those out?
[79:59.54]Look at us.
[80:01.69]Not taking any damage.
[80:03.19]We did alright.
[80:03.75]Yeah, we did pretty good.
[80:05.04]Already at the mini-boss.
[80:08.20]I mean, I took a few hits, but it's alright.
[80:10.12]Nah, we're good, dude.
[80:10.80]I was very distracted.
[80:15.32]Nah, dude, we're good.
[80:17.44]We did this before.
[80:18.04]Guzzle wound?
[80:18.78]Don't worry, we got this guzzle wound.
[80:27.97]Okay, but I'm still mad I died on that last run because I was behind the guy shooting the laser.
[80:31.85]I just thought about it again.
[80:46.79]That was a plus 15 perfects in a row.
[80:52.75]Epic.
[80:53.61]Epic.
[80:58.81]yeah eat up why did I laugh at that what I don't know it's just like weird how you said it I don't it was I don't know yeah man eat up but do you gotta how do you have more gold than me because I am gaming what are you gonna buy
[81:21.88]Ooh.
[81:22.74]Whenever you crit your skills refreshed, that seems... This one seems kind of insane.
[81:28.46]Broken.
[81:31.88]While you have 150 gold or more, gain bonus move speed and crit.
[81:35.92]I think I... Can anybody confirm is the perfect a guaranteed crit or no?
[81:45.25]Probably not.
[81:46.79]Yeah, press tab and hover over the bow and read it.
[81:58.77]I want to buy stuff, though.
[82:02.82]This thing sounds kind of good.
[82:03.58]Alright, now I got to work on crit.
[82:06.76]Alright.
[82:09.28]Can you please say happy birthday to me?
[82:10.74]Otherwise, I won't.
[82:12.00]What is like The Sims?
[82:13.18]Somebody said if I don't say happy birthday, it won't happen or something.
[82:17.02]What is it?
[82:19.10]Happy birthday, whoever you are.
[82:21.36]Talk to the top right.
[82:29.79]Just top left.
[82:38.23]You good?
[82:39.43]I'm good.
[82:41.02]Happy birthday, whoever that is.
[82:49.54]I really shouldn't have gotten hit by that, but I did.
[82:54.90]You know, it happens to the best of us.
[83:01.17]Skill selector.
[83:02.69]Yeah, you get that second skill to start popping off.
[83:29.06]Ooh, you identify.
[83:31.08]That's like the third of those we found.
[83:36.27]Blast Bomb?
[83:37.97]Or, oh, Knight's Charge.
[83:39.41]Knight's Charge.
[83:40.09]Knight's Charge.
[83:40.93]Every time, Knight's Charge.
[83:41.81]Yeah, why would I have picked up Knight's Charge?
[83:43.34]I'm using a bow.
[83:47.46]Because you're invulnerable while you do it, and it stuns everything.
[83:51.40]So you could dash away from things.
[83:54.47]Kind of like... I want to try this.
[83:55.63]Oh, that's what I've been using.
[83:58.51]Pretty good.
[83:59.17]Not bad.
[83:59.43]Pretty good.
[84:01.09]Yeah, seems like you've been having a ball with it.
[84:02.83]Yeah, absolute ball.
[84:10.40]When is Star going to play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[84:13.20]Wait, while Star plays Five Nights at Freddy's, can we watch the Emoji movie?
[84:17.59]Um... No.
[84:21.73]The point is to watch me play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[84:27.42]I don't know why that's the point, but that is what the point is.
[84:41.89]That's what he decided he wanted.
[84:44.51]I can't believe you've never played Five Nights at Freddy's.
[84:46.75]Not once, ever.
[84:49.92]I feel like that's so... I don't know how you avoided that, being a YouTuber back in 2012.
[84:55.98]How did you even avoid not playing it?
[84:57.64]That's like saying you've never played Minecraft before.
[85:01.98]Minecraft's an actual game.
[85:04.20]Yeah, but... But, you know what I'm saying, though?
[85:07.76]How did you avoid it?
[85:09.42]I just didn't do it.
[85:10.52]I just... I just played what I wanted to play, you know what I mean?
[85:19.75]10 HP dude your your health is getting up there man oh there's a game that I I want to stream it looks I don't know why I just get reminded of it looks really interesting it came out like about a golem game
[85:44.73]Yeah, bro.
[85:45.51]This is game coming out.
[85:47.25]You play as Gollum from Lord of the Rings.
[85:49.73]And you crawl.
[85:50.99]Remember when I said that one?
[85:52.05]Remember when I said that?
[85:53.93]I remember when you said that.
[85:56.52]Have you heard him?
[85:57.32]Did you hear that?
[86:00.46]That was weird.
[86:02.44]Did anybody hear that?
[86:03.96]I didn't hear it.
[86:07.73]Did you hear like the... No, I didn't.
[86:12.35]Does anybody... So when you're talking sometimes, do you sometimes... And people don't ever kind of notice that you do it.
[86:20.77]Maybe sometimes people hear you do it.
[86:22.51]But do you ever while you're talking... So there was a game you wanted to play.
[86:25.06]Just listen.
[86:27.26]When you talk, sometimes do you go like this?
[86:29.40]Like blah, blah, blah, blah, blah.
[86:30.20]I thought that was in the game.
[86:34.56]Did you do that?
[86:35.30]You fucked me up.
[86:37.42]Okay.
[86:38.96]Do you ever talk and sometimes you just go like...
[86:43.48]Like, you're just like, yeah, and then, uh... And so I have to do... I feel like that happens to way more of us than we'll care to admit.
[86:52.84]What is the... I'm confused.
[86:54.28]What's the question?
[86:55.02]Do you sometimes have, like, air squeak come out of your throat sometimes while you are talking?
[87:01.99]I guess.
[87:02.93]Like, have you ever noticed that you go, like...
[87:07.78]Yeah, my voice cracked pretty bad the other day.
[87:09.98]No, no, no, not a voice crack.
[87:10.92]This is just like air escaping in the middle of your sentence.
[87:13.76]Just like... I think that's kind of the same.
[87:19.87]No, a true voice crack is like... No, no, no, I'm talking about you're like, yeah, and... I also went to the store...
[87:31.49]I can't hear anything.
[87:34.19]Well, people in my community can.
[87:45.16]Oh, congrats.
[87:50.72]Dude, I'm not gaming.
[87:53.26]Oh, I am.
[87:53.94]Yeah, because you have the bow.
[87:55.51]Does he even attack you once?
[88:02.54]You gotta clear the adds.
[88:03.42]They're coming after the caster.
[88:13.49]Dude, I'm gonna die.
[88:14.71]I'm gonna die, dude.
[88:50.90]Skill damage plus 20%.
[88:52.08]You better not die with that.
[88:58.97]Better not die picking that shit up after the boss.
[89:01.07]Everyone's telling you to apologize.
[89:03.13]Oh, wait.
[89:03.45]About what?
[89:06.06]Apologize for?
[89:06.98]You said... Hold on.
[89:14.42]Oh, stop.
[89:16.19]Who killed that boss?
[89:27.75]Because you refused to eat, so therefore... I didn't need to.
[89:37.97]I've got potato chip grease all over my controller.
[89:40.29]That's what's going on.
[89:43.83]Oh, you said ayaya.
[89:46.07]Apologize for saying ayaya?
[89:47.43]That's what they're saying.
[89:49.17]I said, what's wrong with you?
[89:54.84]I'm just relaying what 500,000 people just said.
[90:05.95]I have a question for you, Ster.
[90:06.75]Yeah, I have a question.
[90:09.56]It always starts like that.
[90:10.64]I got a question for you.
[90:11.92]Hey, listen, man, I got a question for you.
[90:13.96]Okay, and I'm going to answer this question like it's a job interview.
[90:17.28]Okay.
[90:19.21]How long, realistically speaking, if you and I both sat here and in a high-pitched voice said, ayaya, over and over again, how long would it take for us to lose 90% of our viewers that are here?
[90:35.54]be realistic I think like most people would stay yeah for a while to be like how long it would probably go it's really happening I think it would go up yeah like at a certain point like an hour and someone will make like a post on like Twitter like dude they're still doing the iob and like more people show up true
[91:00.48]especially if we came up with like a good reason for why we were doing it like we're doing this to protest the war in Vietnam come home send our troops home do ayaya for charity
[91:30.90]It's because there's something wrong with you.
[91:34.94]What's... You're just going to say Dragon Ball Z. What's your favorite anime?
[91:38.66]We're talking about cartoons.
[91:39.92]Now we're going to talk about adult animated cartoons from Japan.
[91:46.63]I can tell you that because I've seen quite a few.
[91:51.89]It is not what everybody in here thinks it is.
[91:56.19]My favorite... Okay, so let me say...
[92:01.01]hmm okay I really do genuinely love the entire concept and I'm a big I'm a big concept guy right oh this guy loves concepts I'm not I don't really care about um I just love like just I want to interrupt I love that was the first time I've really done it but I asked you a question and then I watched your gameplay and I just fucking I loved it how quickly it degraded
[92:30.04]You were just, like, charging arrows and shooting at, like, walls.
[92:33.30]I was?
[92:35.14]Yeah.
[92:35.70]Anyway, so... Back on track.
[92:37.98]Favorite anime.
[92:40.78]This... The concept of this series... And we're talking that this could be... Most... Ugh!
[92:47.31]What?
[92:48.49]What is going on with you?
[92:52.61]I don't know, dude.
[92:53.97]The concept...
[92:58.10]So good.
[92:59.18]I'm just kidding.
[92:59.76]Hey, dude, do you ever think that if you have, like, do you ever think that you have a dog, right?
[93:04.96]Yes.
[93:05.26]I don't know why I just thought of this, but, like, dude, do you ever think that, like, your dog is usually, if they're over the age of 10, they're, like, 60.
[93:12.62]Do you ever think that it's, like, funny that there's, like, some 70-year-old dude just lying on your couch?
[93:20.29]I've never thought of it like that.
[93:23.17]Do you ever think your dog just lying there, like...
[93:27.65]Yeah, this is comfortable.
[93:29.78]Can I have some food?
[93:31.14]Is this like a 70-year-old guy just lying on the couch?
[93:34.94]Okay.
[93:36.88]I like pick Otto up and I'm like, oh, let's go, Otto.
[93:39.90]He's like an old man.
[93:41.57]Like, ah, yeah.
[93:43.79]Carry me up the stairs, human.
[93:45.65]Just as a refresher, I asked him what his favorite anime was like five minutes ago.
[93:51.77]One Punch Man.
[94:05.72]But isn't Mob Psycho just a better One Punch Man?
[94:08.22]Yeah, people keep saying that, but I gotta get, I gotta watch this.
[94:13.62]Okay, the concept of One Punch Man, the entire series, that's a really interesting series.
[94:21.43]is well I don't want to spoil anything but that that's a concept that I find very interesting because I need to see where they're going with it like I need to know where they're going with that because you know it's gonna something has to happen right it's an amazing concept uh something something does have to happen in the show well but I mean something it makes you think about like wait what's going on here what the heck's happening here
[94:46.73]I feel you.
[94:47.53]Good show.
[94:48.60]Plus, music.
[94:51.22]When he goes in for a punch, when Saitama goes for a punch, and they play that fucking song.
[94:57.62]That like... Oh, man.
[95:06.97]He's going to do it.
[95:09.69]He's going to do it.
[95:10.33]He's going to do it.
[95:12.51]And you know it's going to happen.
[95:13.96]And you know what's going to happen.
[95:16.46]and then he does it and he does it and then the thing he won and then there was one punch so I am just I need to know what's going on there that's why I like that show
[95:33.97]But now that you know what's going on there.
[95:36.23]I don't know.
[95:36.59]Did that change it?
[95:37.45]I don't.
[95:37.69]You don't?
[95:38.19]I actually don't know.
[95:38.99]What do you mean you don't know?
[95:42.52]Did you not watch the show?
[95:43.94]Yeah, but I haven't read the manga or anything.
[95:48.48]Why can he do that, right?
[95:50.10]And spoilers in chat, you're going to get permanent.
[95:53.00]You will be permanently banned from this channel.
[95:54.44]Because he does 100 push-ups.
[95:55.70]No, but then I just, yeah, I know.
[95:57.06]But like, come on, just wait.
[95:59.90]Isn't the anime like over?
[96:02.63]No.
[96:03.25]There's not more in the manga?
[96:04.45]I wouldn't know.
[96:05.77]I don't think it's over yet.
[96:06.47]I don't know how to read.
[96:07.61]I'm pretty sure one punch in.
[96:08.31]I thought it was over.
[96:09.35]It's still going.
[96:10.17]I think there's still some more left.
[96:13.60]I think the manga is coming close to ending, isn't it?
[96:18.22]The manga is ongoing.
[96:19.32]There's a lot more in the manga.
[96:20.44]Yeah, I'm serious.
[96:22.02]You will get dropped from this community.
[96:24.17]I don't want to see shit over here.
[96:25.51]Mods, you know what to do if you see the real shit.
[96:36.81]okay alright uh if it's not one punch man I mean full metal alchemist is a really simple oh yeah you're you're I remember you're you're a full metal full metal alchemist it was cool I liked it and you're telling me that you don't ship winery with anyone I I just I enjoyed the show man okay I enjoyed the television show
[97:18.97]Stop him.
[97:21.08]What do you mean?
[97:23.28]Do you guys know that humans are romantically intertwined on the regular?
[97:29.26]It's normal for a man and a woman or whoever wants to kiss whoever.
[97:34.06]It happens all the time.
[97:39.89]I'm seeing all these cat lean-in memes.
[97:43.49]What is this cat lean-in thing?
[97:46.05]Oh, fuck.
[97:46.39]I'm going to die.
[98:01.64]chat your mom and your dad kissed shut up passionately your mom and your dad kissed passionately
[98:26.63]And someone's mom could be Raven and someone's dad could be Beast Boy.
[98:34.47]What's wrong with that?
[98:46.20]Breaking hearts?
[98:47.04]What?
[98:49.72]You ready to fight the boss?
[98:51.20]Yeah.
[98:53.58]Don't die.
[98:55.20]Or if you're going to die, it's a good room to do it because you wake up afterwards.
[98:59.75]But you haven't fought this boss before, so you're going to watch out for his ice attacks.
[99:20.27]Alright, which one of the Teen Titans would you want to be?
[99:23.15]Would I want to be?
[99:24.35]Like, oh, what Teen Titan are you?
[99:26.35]Let's just say you took one of those quizzes.
[99:29.97]Oh, man.
[99:33.79]I'd want to be Raven.
[99:41.66]Is it cliche and lame to say Robin?
[99:47.13]kind of I I'm I was thinking that and I was thinking you were gonna say that because robin's superpower is having social control over everyone and that seems like the thing that you'd be into it's just just like any anyone says some shit you just shut it down well I was gonna say because I like nightwing but okay well I guess we'll take that what do you like about nightwing what's nothing like about nightwing
[100:14.63]Got big shoes to fill.
[100:16.79]You know, that's a lot of pressure.
[100:19.15]You know, Batman's what essentially is a sidekick, right?
[100:23.85]And then all of them, you know, wants to be... That's a lot of pressure.
[100:27.84]I like the idea of, you know, he lives up to it.
[100:36.64]Okay.
[100:39.94]You buying anything?
[100:40.64]People are saying he's got a huge ass.
[100:44.37]Nightwing?
[100:45.11]Honestly, I've never really thought about it, but to recollect the trailers that had Nightwing in it, he did have a big ass.
[100:53.64]Except I got something in common with Nightwing.
[100:58.08]Because it's huge.
[101:03.70]Yeah.
[101:05.30]Yeah.
[101:06.01]No, you're not wrong.
[101:09.89]The snowball was alright.
[101:13.88]try this alright we good what was the what were we oh what team titan you would want to be yeah yeah well you said x-men was one of your favorite shows which x-men are you um
[101:30.98]I would say Nightcrawler because of the X-Men arcade game.
[101:35.27]My favorite character.
[101:37.55]Yeah, I know.
[101:38.43]If it wasn't Nightcrawler, then it would probably be either Cyclops or probably Cyclops or Gambit.
[101:46.76]Oh, Beast.
[101:47.32]No, Beast.
[101:47.85]Beast is an easy answer.
[101:51.84]I like Beast.
[101:53.77]What about him?
[101:55.33]I just want to be smart.
[101:56.55]He's incredibly intelligent.
[101:58.69]He's got the brain.
[101:59.55]He's got the physical ability.
[102:03.17]He's good at problem solving.
[102:04.42]He's reasonable.
[102:10.26]I think he's got leadership written all over him.
[102:17.48]I don't know what I... I don't know what I would... You've been hanging out with me way too much.
[102:30.75]I have, but I'm getting germapilled.
[102:35.55]My heart, for some reason, again, is telling me that it would be cool to be Dark Phoenix and just end the world.
[102:45.67]like like if the world's gotta end wouldn't it be cool if like I did it I mean kind of I mean I look up in the sky and I just see you up there floating you know what my like least favorite superhero trope is I've been thinking a lot about lately I don't know why it like keeps coming up and I keep thinking about it there's always the one hero who has an awesome ability and then does the like
[103:09.57]it's my burden to have this power I didn't ask for this oh my god I don't want to have this strength and they have like the best power in the whole show but they're like not happy about it so wasn't it like uh not uh the one who touched people was the Jean gray or just like man I'm so sick of being able to have any superpower I want at any time make it go away
[103:35.70]Rogue?
[103:36.20]It was Rogue.
[103:37.16]Yeah.
[103:37.82]Oh, okay.
[103:38.46]I was like, what is he talking about?
[103:39.58]I was like, what X-Men character just touches people?
[103:44.15]Yeah, Rogue.
[103:45.03]I'm not just... You're being weird.
[103:48.77]You're the one being weird.
[103:50.47]Okay.
[103:51.89]No, I'm genuinely trying.
[103:53.53]I was trying to figure out who... The powers, they go like this.
[104:00.10]I'm dead.
[104:03.16]That's unfortunate.
[104:04.76]How do you have 70?
[104:06.02]We've been talking this whole time.
[104:07.24]How do you have 72 health?
[104:09.86]Because instead of taking the max health perk, I took the heal 5 after every room.
[104:14.23]Because that sounded really good.
[104:15.51]And by the way, Rogue's power is not touching people.
[104:19.59]Power is absorption.
[104:22.57]Absorption.
[104:23.23]Stupid idiot.
[104:25.70]Sorry, I'm sorry.
[104:27.28]I got really...
[104:29.25]I feel like I'm being bullied.
[104:32.79]Every time I have an opinion, you want to talk about your community?
[104:36.07]Your community dogpiles on me.
[104:37.93]And you're encouraging it.
[104:41.42]And I don't know if I feel welcome here.
[104:44.46]Just because I want to see Beast Boy and Raven together doesn't mean I'm weird.
[105:10.42]I'm just gonna keep powering up.
[105:13.92]Bring me back.
[105:15.90]I have OK, OK.
[105:20.98]But Rogue's power is absorption.
[105:23.17]Okay, I believe you!
[105:30.77]Jerma, why are you so toxic?
[105:33.65]Every single thing that Ster and I are doing right now is all for real.
[105:39.52]And I mean everything I'm saying about it.
[105:47.42]No, the fucked up thing about you is that...
[105:51.12]you're what you're actually thinking is worse than what you're saying you still haven't killed the mini boss yet I know I've been waiting for at least two or three minutes maybe you shouldn't have died yeah okay okay here he is you got it you got it you got it you got it that's very loud that's very loud
[106:20.37]He's such a meanie.
[106:26.02]Your internal monologue.
[106:28.88]Okay, but if you had to be an X-Men, which person are you picking for explicitly their power?
[106:33.84]Like, you want that power.
[106:35.18]Cyclops.
[106:37.14]Why the fuck would you want to be Cyclops?
[106:39.80]Cyclops' power is fucking amazing.
[106:42.04]I've already had this argument.
[106:42.84]What would you use it for?
[106:44.30]What would you use any X-Men power for?
[106:46.49]They're too... What do you mean?
[106:50.30]all x-men powers are about like fucking like killing like attacking people what power exists in the x-men universe mystique mystique just transform into like any person so I could trick you to finally love me that's not like fighting isn't there someone who has like healing powers as well like they put their hands on someone they just like oh they're healed and you're like no I want to be able to shoot lasers you you know what you know what superhero you would be
[107:18.72]I know what it is.
[107:20.00]What?
[107:21.04]Homelander.
[107:23.58]Oh, please.
[107:27.52]Yeah, you want laser eyes.
[107:30.33]I... I'd be pretty sick.
[107:38.65]For you.
[107:39.01]I'd be pretty sick for you.
[107:55.41]Well, I don't know.
[107:55.95]What's the correct answer there?
[107:58.21]Oh, that was... There's no correct answer.
[108:01.88]It's just what would you actually do with Cyclops' power is the question.
[108:06.06]I don't know.
[108:07.92]The only thing it can do is kill people you look at.
[108:11.36]Yeah.
[108:12.42]How often do you want to do that?
[108:14.63]Why?
[108:15.25]Why?
[108:16.33]Why are you?
[108:17.33]Okay.
[108:17.65]Are we in the X-Men universe or are we just like in my living room?
[108:21.37]We're in your living room.
[108:22.71]Okay.
[108:23.85]Do I need a superpower?
[108:26.41]You don't need one, but I'm offering you as God.
[108:30.52]Who can create food?
[108:32.20]Well, I would just create food and solve a shitload of problems.
[108:36.54]I would do that one.
[108:37.28]Can somebody do that?
[108:37.92]Is there a farmer?
[108:43.32]Was there a power that could benefit the greater good?
[108:46.77]Right?
[108:47.91]I don't know.
[108:49.53]Politician answer.
[108:51.07]No, it's not.
[108:52.13]Politician answer.
[108:53.75]I don't even know what it is, but whichever benefited mankind the most is the one that I would select, obviously.
[108:58.41]God damn it, you got me.
[108:59.97]You fucking got me.
[109:01.25]You piece of shit.
[109:02.38]He's got me.
[109:03.44]Fuck, he's got me.
[109:04.56]He's got me.
[109:06.72]That happens during a political debate.
[109:10.81]yeah the next presidential debate so which X-Men power would you want?
[109:15.13]I would definitely want Cyclops so I could incinerate anyone that I'm looking at oh no I mean the one the one that helps the one the food one I don't know my bad wait am I just in my house?
[109:37.69]right then the food one
[109:40.53]oh man that's so stupid I mean come on who doesn't have who does what are you trying to tell me you have not sat around and been like oh man imagine if I was like a powerful being and I could fly and I could like defend everybody like everybody's had that oh yeah I imagine if opening my eyes only caused destruction
[110:13.99]Fly does not mean defend.
[110:15.89]Yeah, what I... You got me so fucked up here.
[110:20.31]This is so funny.
[110:24.13]You trying to... You have never... You have never stood in the mirror like this.
[110:31.81]I gotta see what you're doing.
[110:33.35]You've never stood in the mirror like this and been like, leave everything to me.
[110:37.75]You've never done that before?
[110:40.49]You've never been like, leave everything to me, citizens.
[110:44.68]You've never done that before?
[110:45.93]That's the saddest thing you've ever said.
[110:50.05]That not only do you do that, but you're so shocked another human being wouldn't stand in the mirror and do that.
[110:59.61]I do it naked in the mirror.
[111:02.07]So I do it naked in the mirror.
[111:03.49]Are you going to be mad at me for that too?
[111:04.57]I do it naked in the mirror.
[111:06.74]After getting out of the shower every morning, I look in the mirror.
[111:11.72]There's nothing wrong with that.
[111:14.58]I mean, if you got the body for it, and honey, I know you do.
[111:28.69]Okay, you haven't played this stage before.
[111:30.31]What would your power be again, Mr. Perfect?
[111:34.45]Okay, well, if I'm the only one in the world that has a power, I can't pick Rogue.
[111:38.08]Rogue is the obvious because you just get literally every power.
[111:41.92]Um...
[111:45.14]I don't know, Wolverine gets to like, Wolverine's another one.
[111:47.50]He gets to live forever as like the strongest dude in the fucking world.
[111:51.24]And he's like, I am so, I just wish I would die, man.
[111:54.63]I'm so bored of being the strongest guy who lives forever.
[111:59.01]It doesn't have to worry about disease or anything.
[112:02.47]Everyone who's strong is fucking, they just, they hate it.
[112:06.58]You just don't like, I don't know, Wolverine or Charles Xavier.
[112:11.15]You just gave me shit for saying leave everything to me in the mirror.
[112:16.27]But you are psychoanalyzing every X-Men character.
[112:20.41]I'm just bringing up the trope that I don't like where everyone who is strong hates that they are strong and it's a burden on them.
[112:26.65]Like everyone else doesn't have like real problems.
[112:29.19]Wolverine's problem is that he is immune to everything and he hates it.
[112:37.31]um that's it's the total opposite of what you're doing where you go in the mirror leave it to me citizens wolverine's version of that is going in the mirror and saying I could save I could save them but I'm sad about it you've definitely done that in the mirror before I mean like I just okay but hey you added extra context though
[113:03.98]Wait, what was the extra context?
[113:05.48]Am I not allowed to elaborate and continue the conversation?
[113:09.44]Alright, so here's my point.
[113:10.80]So when you ask somebody, hey, what would you have for a superpower?
[113:16.29]And the person just goes like, I don't know, they're eating a sandwich, like, laser eyes, I guess, I don't know.
[113:20.99]Monster!
[113:21.41]You're a monster!
[113:22.05]You're a monster!
[113:22.91]You're a monster!
[113:23.53]That's weird!
[113:24.79]What?
[113:25.89]The first thing that comes to your mind...
[113:29.25]Being laser eyes is weird.
[113:31.43]I thought a Superman has a Cyclops.
[113:34.01]It's just like an easy, like, I guess, I don't know, flight.
[113:36.87]Laser eyes.
[113:38.01]No, flight would be normal.
[113:39.48]Oh, everyone wants to fly.
[113:40.88]Not everyone wants to, and especially specifically Cyclops, who can't control it and just does it.
[113:46.64]He has special glasses.
[113:49.84]So you want to wear special glasses the rest of your life, and if you ever take them off, you, like, kill all of your loved ones?
[113:58.53]You just wake up in the morning and you're just like, ah, alright, it's going to be a good day today.
[114:03.70]You just blow a hole in your ceiling through it.
[114:06.78]Yeah.
[114:08.90]Oh my, I'm sorry.
[114:09.55]My glasses came off, honey.
[114:10.85]Are you still there?
[114:16.38]What was your power?
[114:17.22]What was it?
[114:17.58]I forget what it was.
[114:20.21]It was being able to change.
[114:21.79]You wanted to change into other people.
[114:24.21]You wanted Mystique's power.
[114:25.57]Mystique would be good.
[114:26.87]Xavier would be good.
[114:27.77]Wolverine would be good.
[114:31.26]Why wouldn't you... Xavier?
[114:35.87]Charles Xavier.
[114:36.95]I feel like that would be too much.
[114:38.87]I don't know if I want that.
[114:39.77]Just to like tap into the room and like NSA anyone in the world.
[114:43.99]And that, and wait, whoa.
[114:47.37]Me wanting laser eyes is crazy, but you wanting to tap into everybody's brain is completely normal human behavior.
[114:56.52]Very interesting.
[114:58.50]Do you ever fantasize about like, if you had the power to like stop time, you would just use it to be better at video games?
[115:10.90]Yeah.
[115:13.12]Yeah, I do.
[115:16.00]Yeah, that's bad.
[115:18.11]I would just join a speedrun category and just have a world record that's unbeatable.
[115:24.51]You'd be a fucking TrackMania player.
[115:26.09]Alright, let's gravitate to a more normal conversation.
[115:36.96]Do you have one?
[115:38.64]Yeah.
[115:42.53]Ster 1, Jerma 0.
[115:44.35]At this point, it's probably like Ster 12, Jerma 8 or something.
[115:49.71]We've been having a lot of conversations.
[115:51.27]Who's keeping track?
[115:53.67]Who's scoring our conversations?
[115:59.48]Yeah.
[116:01.02]Yeah, cut that shit out.
[116:03.72]The score would be funny, though.
[116:09.58]What are you guys scoring this?
[116:12.81]What's the score?
[116:13.21]What are you guys scoring this right now?
[116:14.61]This is a boxing match between the two of us.
[116:23.03]Too biased.
[116:23.65]1-0 Ster.
[116:25.79]Like, they just joined the stream.
[116:27.55]Well, that's what I'm saying.
[116:28.47]They've heard it like one bit.
[116:32.62]You're both basically dead at this point.
[116:36.94]Ster is 15 and you're at a 2.
[116:38.24]No way.
[116:44.04]No way.
[116:46.98]Who is the guy that could run at super speed?
[116:49.54]Not the Flash, the X-Men version.
[116:51.90]Quicksilver, who does nothing in every movie.
[116:54.90]I would be Quicksilver, but I'd do something in the movie.
[116:58.98]People would argue that Quicksilver's parts in those movies were the only good parts of those movies.
[117:04.24]Exactly, and I would be those parts.
[117:22.47]Holy shit.
[117:28.46]Holy shit, I didn't even tell you about the game.
[117:32.23]I know I tried to get us back on that for a second um and we sort of just you know we went off on a bit of a tangent the game is called Disc Room oh I played it is it good yeah seems fun seems like a really really uh seems very very nice to play yeah uh some of the stages like
[118:03.13]I'm a bit of an idiot, so they were a little bit too puzzle gamey feeling for me.
[118:08.25]But overall, I liked it a lot.
[118:13.66]You got him?
[118:14.96]Yeah, I got him.
[118:22.68]Why are you bringing the game up?
[118:25.85]I just had to know if you played or not.
[118:27.91]Is it on Game Pass?
[118:31.83]Do I have to answer that question?
[118:37.75]You basically just answered it.
[118:44.65]Here, take these gloves.
[118:46.58]You're building crit, right?
[118:47.68]I am.
[118:48.12]Okay.

[119:00.47]It's totally happening.
[119:01.73]It is guaranteed to happen today.
[119:05.38]I mean, I'm enjoying this game right now.
[119:07.52]I'm enjoying the conversation.
[119:08.74]We're not in a hurry.
[119:10.76]This has been some wild conversations.
[119:13.36]I'm having fun.

[120:19.09]Balloon Boy.
[120:22.36]Just because he goes, Hello.
[120:26.86]I can't participate in this conversation, so I feel like it's leaving me out, and I don't like that.
[120:33.80]Well, you'll know soon enough.
[120:34.72]Alright, we got to actually play now.
[120:44.29]Okay.

[121:14.52]Watch out for those chains.

[124:49.23]And I know that I'm, I already know by you asking the question, this is, uh, I'm like, Sir L. No, no, no.
[124:54.74]It's not.
[124:55.74]No, it is like 110 degrees out.
[124:59.22]It's my ideal climate.
[125:01.00]Are you being serious?
[125:03.56]Yeah.
[125:03.88]Like, you know I'm messing around or anything?
[125:04.94]No, I'm not messing around.
[125:06.04]Because that's mine too.
[125:09.46]Holy shit, we're both losers.
[125:12.36]I... Sir, I live in Las Vegas.
[125:15.35]I know it's my my story is I moved to Texas I'd never been here before moved straight to Texas when I got here it was summer it was 118 degrees out I was like oh shit Texas weather I'm gonna have to get used to this so like mentally I attuned I like you know what I'm saying I locked it in and then I realized that we have no infrastructure and everything freezes during the winter and it's not actually like that all year round
[125:41.48]Because I used to be a, like, I like it cold guy.
[125:43.94]Like, the cold doesn't bother me anyway, frozen type of guy.
[125:48.52]But when I moved to Texas, I, like, I rerouted my neurons.
[125:52.66]You know what I'm saying?
[125:53.68]Yeah.
[125:55.52]And now I expect the 100 degrees.
[125:58.95]Expect the 100, yep.
[126:00.35]But I don't get the 100.
[126:01.27]Nah, no way.
[126:16.29]Is that it?
[126:17.75]I'm going to die because I'm being a fucking idiot.
[126:20.61]I got you.
[126:21.09]I'm saving you.
[126:22.35]Thank you.
[126:22.67]Yeah, I'm similar mindset.
[126:29.54]I like how dry it is here.
[126:32.74]So even though it's 100 plus degrees a lot of the year, it doesn't feel like it.
[126:40.12]You don't really sweat.
[126:41.62]Come eat this apple.
[126:42.40]Come eat this apple.
[126:45.76]It's behind the... Do you get it?
[126:47.58]Back here.
[126:48.92]There it is.
[126:50.70]Do you want this heal room?
[126:52.46]It's... Yeah, you want it.
[126:57.24]Drink up.
[126:58.70]You're always sweating.
[127:00.12]I sweat when I sit here because I don't know.
[127:02.20]Hey, I have no idea what it is about like streaming.
[127:07.73]It sweats you up.
[127:09.19]No, it does.
[127:09.67]It really is.
[127:10.15]It's just the way it is.
[127:12.37]Take a little bit of that.
[127:12.99]I don't want to take it all.
[127:14.23]Just take the few points for the weapon here.
[127:19.48]No, you're missing two HP.
[127:21.50]Yeah, I don't.
[127:22.86]I heal every room.
[127:24.34]I have max health.
[127:25.52]At least take the one.
[127:26.40]Get yourself over 70.
[127:27.02]Okay.
[127:34.46]But no, I like... Oh, goddammit.
[127:36.90]You were right.
[127:37.46]Here we are.
[127:39.04]I forgot.
[127:39.70]Yeah, I forgot too.
[127:41.18]I don't know how many rooms are before the boss, you know?
[127:45.14]Guess I'll eat one.
[127:49.93]um okay this boss I've actually I've seen this one I have I don't remember it but I remember it being like you don't you don't want to talk to me about croutons right now I need you to focus up hold on can I say something
[128:06.55]Yeah.
[128:08.45]Okay.
[128:09.55]Holly and I went somewhere, and I could not believe it.
[128:13.48]I was so wrong.
[128:14.52]I was so incorrect.
[128:16.30]And I feel bad, because it was fucking delicious.
[128:19.68]Service was unbelievable.
[128:20.98]Olive Garden?
[128:21.84]Is that where we're going with this?
[128:24.34]No, no.
[128:25.04]And it was super nice.
[128:27.04]It was really nice.
[128:28.50]Everybody was so...
[128:29.90]Pleasant.
[128:30.74]It was a wonderful experience.
[128:32.24]The food was perfect.
[128:34.17]And I feel bad that I may have, maybe over the course of my life, said something negative about this place.
[128:41.15]And of course I'm talking about Outback Steakhouse.
[128:45.27]We got a Bloomin' Onion and it was fucking awesome.
[128:48.35]Why would you talk shit about Outback Steakhouse?
[128:50.61]I don't know.
[128:51.19]I don't know what the hell I was thinking.
[128:54.33]And you'd never been to one?
[128:55.55]No, I had.
[128:57.82]Have I talked shit about Outback before?
[129:01.90]I don't have the logs.
[129:03.46]Somebody does.
[129:05.71]You must have.
[129:06.81]I don't think I have.
[129:08.15]Maybe not Outback.
[129:09.71]It'd be really weird if you hadn't and you just started the conversation this way.
[129:14.99]I feel like you're making me doubt you, but you started really confident in what you were saying.
[129:20.74]No, I hadn't had it in a while.
[129:22.80]I kind of just like wrote it off as, oh, whatever.
[129:24.98]No, no, no, no, no.
[129:25.64]I don't want to go there.
[129:26.72]No, no, no, no.
[129:27.28]I'm not going there.
[129:28.04]Nah, nah, nah.
[129:30.03]Place is fucking like a C minus at best.
[129:33.19]We had it.
[129:35.89]It was fantastic.
[129:37.03]It was a wonderful experience.
[129:39.31]Just got to say it.
[129:39.93]I got to be real.
[129:40.99]I have to.
[129:44.81]Thank you for keeping it real with me.
[129:46.99]Thank you.
[129:47.93]I appreciate it.
[129:48.59]You're welcome.
[129:50.31]It's a first for everything.
[129:53.55]Maybe it was... It might have been a tier list.
[129:55.39]Why is my... My voice is gone already.
[129:57.29]It's been like an hour.
[129:58.12]What's going on?
[129:58.76]It must have been a tier list.
[130:04.30]Okay, focus.
[130:04.94]Remember, focus.
[130:06.10]Look at that thing.
[130:07.73]Watch out for the phantom's attack.
[130:10.97]He's casting spells.
[130:12.39]Casting.
[130:14.05]Alright, stop.
[130:14.57]You're going to want to dodge those.
[130:24.01]This is not fun for melee.
[130:25.29]He keeps dashing away.
[130:34.57]Like every time I go to attack, he goes away.
[130:45.78]It's done again.
[130:46.50]What's he doing?
[131:02.24]Who knows?
[131:02.96]Phase two.
[131:05.68]Don't get grabbed by the hand.
[131:06.86]I feel like we have to destroy those.
[131:08.76]What the fuck?
[131:11.91]What an overreacting.
[131:13.93]Yo, what?
[131:15.33]Whoa!
[131:16.25]Don't this cost us attacks?
[131:18.49]Holy shit, dude.
[131:20.29]I can't even... I can't do it.
[131:22.17]I can't comprehend.
[131:32.35]This can't be for real.
[131:42.44]Dodge this.
[131:45.61]What is this?
[131:51.51]Don't let him!
[131:51.93]He's sucking that thing!
[131:56.48]Oh, he's stunned.
[132:02.28]I pressed the wrong button.
[132:02.96]I thought I was playing Elden Ring.
[132:03.75]I don't know what he's doing.
[132:15.30]I'm gonna get rid of this.
[132:16.14]Oh my god.
[132:18.02]He stunlocked me.
[132:19.08]He fucking stunlocked me.
[132:21.04]He throws me and stunlocked my ass.
[132:22.97]Watch your pro.
[132:26.07]I couldn't move.
[132:26.51]I was so hellbent on killing the fucking tower thingies.
[132:41.74]Oh shit.
[132:43.06]I can't get around!
[132:45.70]Watch out, you're gonna get stuck like I did.
[132:52.66]I can only hope.
[132:54.04]How do you break out of that stun?
[132:55.26]Do you just have to mash every button?
[133:12.06]What?
[133:15.04]What is happening?
[133:15.70]That did so much damage.
[133:19.94]That's not where he was shooting, though.
[133:22.94]We'll get him next time.
[133:28.12]I don't like the bow.
[133:37.17]You don't like the bow?
[133:37.79]I'll use the bow.
[133:40.11]We got a lot of new unlocks.
[133:53.06]old man's got some stuff Ember Knight yes what is it you met praxis what happened I see I understand you have to defeat him oh yes oh perhaps my little leshy boy can help you on your way there's multiple watch out
[134:18.12]Don't be misled by their cat free appearance.
[134:20.80]They work tirelessly to maintain the nexus.
[134:23.68]Let's go.
[134:25.74]Let's go.
[134:27.04]Let's go.
[134:27.70]I know you're embarrassed from that, but we're going to let you have, you're going to have to sit and fucking sulk in that.
[134:33.63]Sulk in what?
[134:37.27]I'm actually, yeah, we need to do this.
[134:40.99]I am the guy.
[134:49.60]You heal 3 HP after completing a room with enemies.
[134:52.99]Oh, this.
[134:53.65]Yeah.
[134:54.07]Do that one.
[134:55.23]Do that one, dude.
[134:56.57]It has to be either or, right?
[134:58.62]Yeah.
[134:59.24]You can swap it.
[135:00.66]I already put a lot of points in this one, so.
[135:02.56]You can respec everything.
[135:03.68]You just press E or respec all your points.
[135:05.34]Oh, that's cool.
[135:06.26]It doesn't cost anything.
[135:08.01]Cool.
[135:19.62]5 HP after completing a room.
[135:21.06]That actually is kind of... I feel like you need it.
[135:25.16]Well, I need it.
[135:27.70]That's how the roguelites are.
[135:31.36]So what about this money one?
[135:32.20]Gain 50 gold when entering a world.
[135:35.32]Boy, now I want more at the beginning.
[135:43.26]This is not bad.
[135:44.54]You should take this one.
[135:45.84]You get the damage bonus above 75% HP.
[135:51.83]I think the urn power would be more consistent.
[135:58.11]And stacks.
[136:01.49]I don't know if you know this, but my mind is ascended.
[136:08.02]You know, if I didn't get to choose which X-Men I was, you just got put which one you actually are, I would be MODOK.
[136:16.21]because I have such a gigantic brain and I am unstoppable.
[136:20.39]My brain's so big I can shoot lasers out of it.
[136:25.22]Right?
[136:25.48]But I can't shoot lasers out of my eyes.
[136:27.86]Well, your eyes are always doing it.
[136:29.78]MODOK is powerful enough to know when to use lasers.
[136:34.52]Okay.
[136:34.62]Let's see how this is.
[136:44.68]So you have to charge it the whole way.
[136:51.59]Actually, I feel like I like this.
[136:53.25]I feel like I'm going to only like the sword.
[137:02.12]There's a hammer and a throwing weapon.
[137:05.27]Alright, what X-Men would I be?
[137:07.19]Really?
[137:07.71]What X-Men would I be?
[137:09.39]Oh, no.
[137:10.13]Forget that.
[137:12.19]What superhero... It doesn't matter.
[137:13.95]What would I be?
[137:14.41]I'm thinking.
[137:21.40]Toad is from Mario.
[137:23.20]From Mario?! !
[137:24.95]No, there's an X-Men name.
[137:26.41]Toad, what are you talking about?
[137:27.53]That's my wife's pick.
[137:34.86]I would not be Toad from X-Men.
[137:37.38]Get out of here.
[137:39.42]No, I would not.
[137:40.20]That's absurd.
[137:41.58]If we're going any superhero, it's definitely Homelander.
[137:48.22]We're still on that.
[137:53.78]Am I lame and basic if I stay with the sword?
[137:56.62]No.
[138:01.06]You sure?
[138:01.66]What is this?
[138:12.68]No.
[138:12.94]Plastic Man?
[138:18.44]Ooh, I like that.
[138:20.70]uh who's the who's the uh the stretchy guy oh green the fantastic four Mr. fantastic yeah that's you oh that's alright that's one of the smartest people ever mold into any shape and conform to anything he needs and he gets to be the leader which I know you like gets to shut any down
[138:48.60]Let's go.
[138:49.20]You ready?
[138:49.92]I would probably be SpongeBob.
[138:54.54]That's a good hero choice.
[139:02.61]Jim carries the mask.
[139:06.59]That also works.
[139:09.51]Except the mask is always on.
[139:12.71]It never comes off.
[139:23.58]You'd be Captain Underpants.
[139:26.82]That's a good hero.
[139:27.74]No, I doubt it.
[139:29.14]I doubt it.
[139:35.97]I'm seeing a lot of trues for Captain Underpants.
[139:39.53]I disagree.
[139:44.97]I would be Anubis.
[139:47.93]The Egyptian god of death?
[140:00.14]This guy wants laser eyes and to be the Egyptian god of death and judge everyone who dies forever.
[140:16.64]And you're missing standing in the mirror and monologuing.
[140:31.48]Well, what if you go to Monologue and you're... Legendary Relic!
[140:36.74]But my HP is never going to fall below 10%.
[140:39.50]I'll take it.
[140:49.92]Haha!
[140:51.44]You don't get it.
[141:01.05]Anubis has the laser eye in smite.
[141:04.71]Yeah.
[141:04.95]Sure does.
[141:08.91]That's so stupid.
[141:10.19]He really does.
[141:10.63]I kind of assumed you were thinking of Anubis as well because you would want to like shoot your cocoon at someone and then talk to him for 10 minutes.
[141:18.18]Well, let me explain to you baddies what you've done wrong here.
[141:34.30]See, I don't see you helping.
[141:36.09]And then, once they finally understand, that's when you laser eye them.
[141:46.08]You baddies.
[142:05.25]Ooh, you take that.
[142:07.63]I made that lasagna just for you.
[142:12.47]I like that.
[142:13.49]I liked that.
[142:14.33]That was nice.
[142:22.14]I just get to keep charging.
[142:23.66]You know what I mean?
[142:26.22]Literally perfect.
[142:31.15]this conversation is like nice and all like what a hero you'd be we would both be the in the ninja turtles the reporter girl we just we just talk about what people are doing uh no there's no way that I'm not michelangelo I'm sorry I'm not I'm gonna have to argue that
[143:03.22]Which one's Michelangelo?
[143:04.34]Isn't he like the smart one?
[143:07.49]Whoa, man.
[143:12.49]If you don't pick up immediately who I'm talking about, you've never, ever, ever watched this show.
[143:15.85]No, I know.
[143:16.05]The orange one.
[143:17.03]Orange one.
[143:17.69]Orange one.
[143:18.17]Orange one.
[143:19.61]That guy goes crazy.
[143:22.99]You know actually why?
[143:24.69]Why?
[143:25.07]I find nunchucks to be a really real... You just laugh at me?
[143:31.78]I saw a nunchuck meme like a week ago I totally agree with.
[143:35.00]It just made me think about it.
[143:38.42]Nunchucks are such a... They're such an unbelievable... It's like a dance.
[143:43.65]It's like a dance.
[143:47.80]It takes a ton of skill to use it.
[143:50.10]It's just like so... For no benefit.
[143:53.80]I mean... I think that... What would you use?
[143:58.92]The meme was about how just a stick is better than a nunchuck.
[144:05.39]Yeah, but there's deception with a nunchuck.
[144:07.29]Don't you understand?
[144:08.27]Is there?
[144:08.67]That's the whole point.
[144:10.11]It's like... And boom!
[144:12.65]Right in the jaw.
[144:13.87]Okay, but like...
[144:15.66]But you're fighting someone who has like a real weapon, like a spear.
[144:18.71]They haven't trained for like 10 years to learn how to use the spear and they just like poke you once.
[144:22.95]Yeah, but spear is overpowered.
[144:23.83]Everybody knows that.
[144:27.45]So you're good enough that you don't need to use a spear.
[144:32.09]But spear is always going to be the best weapon in throwout history.
[144:37.44]That's accurate, right?
[144:39.22]Yeah.
[144:42.82]Spear does everything.
[144:46.73]Okay, so we're no one's allowed to pick spear.
[144:48.59]It's too strong.
[144:49.35]Yeah, we're like in the middle of our pick and ban phase and I banned spear.
[144:54.33]Okay, what would make you want to use nunchucks over like a flail, which is just nunchucks but with a threatening part?
[145:06.55]Have you?
[145:06.81]Have you seen what some people can do with nunchucks?
[145:11.82]You almost can't even see them.
[145:12.98]They're like helicopters.
[145:15.66]Okay.
[145:16.38]But then like, okay.
[145:18.68]Putting myself in, I'm in the combat situation.
[145:20.92]You've got your nunchucks and you're a master.
[145:22.68]We're just assuming you're a master.
[145:24.52]I've had a flail and I know how to use it because I've, I just, I've never used one, but it's like a flail.
[145:29.95]How could you not use it?
[145:31.69]I think I win that fight.
[145:33.09]If I just like take the hits and flail you one time.
[145:35.85]Yeah, but you're also missing the, the potential comedy of that weapon where you do the, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[145:42.38]Oops.
[145:42.66]I hit myself in the balls.
[145:44.06]You're missing that.
[145:50.06]I totally forgot that we're using the weapons for comedy.
[145:56.00]You completely forgot that aspect of it.
[145:58.20]We trained him wrong as a joke.
[146:07.73]Okay.
[146:08.43]I feel like... Same conversation.
[146:12.37]Let's take it down a small notch.
[146:15.27]Okay.
[146:18.00]what dinner food are you you're not a super you don't get to be like a cool super like what dinner are you for this my space quiz okay I'm serious a spicy chili
[146:37.32]I don't know.
[146:37.70]Something about the I'm serious is like you've thought about this and you know.
[146:40.82]I'm a chili.
[146:41.48]I'm definitely a chili.
[146:43.46]Just a bunch of shit in a pot and just like it's so like get everything.
[146:46.28]Got beans in there.
[146:46.96]You got meat in there.
[146:47.78]So you got like sauce.
[146:49.10]Put some fucking hot sauce in it.
[146:50.80]It's just kind of like sloppy, but it's unbelievable.
[146:53.40]Gets the job done.
[146:54.45]It's perfect.
[146:56.61]I would be a chili.
[146:57.33]I would be a spicy chili.
[147:00.45]And by the way, I last a long time.
[147:05.20]Whoa, alright.
[147:09.47]Okay.
[147:10.27]You know what I'm saying?
[147:11.83]You get to pick for me.
[147:14.33]What am I?
[147:14.73]What kind of food am I?
[147:15.49]What dinner meal?
[147:22.31]You know what?
[147:22.99]You're going to be mad.
[147:23.83]I think you're going to be mad.
[147:27.37]Are you going to pick something disgusting?
[147:29.14]No, no.
[147:29.90]I think you're a ham sandwich.
[147:34.32]You're a ham sandwich.
[147:36.08]Elaborate.
[147:37.82]With one... With one smear of mustard on the bottom of the bread.
[147:44.28]On the bot... On the bottom.
[147:46.02]On the bottom of the bread, not in the sandwich.
[147:48.26]Yeah.
[147:50.18]Okay.
[147:58.36]Honestly, you're... You're a slice of pizza.
[148:03.18]Because everyone likes pizza.
[148:06.58]I think because you... And you could put anything on me.
[148:09.69]Yeah, I think that... You'd be like a nice slice of pizza.
[148:14.85]Thank you.
[148:15.33]That's a lot better than a ham sandwich with mustard on the bottom.
[148:19.59]I know.
[148:19.97]I was just being mean for no reason.
[148:21.37]I was just being rude.
[148:22.35]Alright, well, no.
[148:25.41]Now you be mean to me.
[148:27.61]Wait, you want me to be mean to you?
[148:29.09]What food am I?
[148:30.01]I said I was chilly.
[148:31.01]What are you... Your turn.
[148:36.75]uh hmm and don't say boogers that doesn't count as food I sometimes sometimes it's screaming to me spaghetti it's not rude it's not rude I feel like you I feel like you'd be a spaghetti by the way ham sandwich I said that's not even rude you know how versatile a ham sandwich is
[149:00.54]I do like ham sandwiches.
[149:01.96]Do you know ham sandwich can come in in the clutch and really bail your ass out big time?
[149:08.56]And that hint of mustard is enough of a kick to keep you going?
[149:14.20]I'm happy to know that that's how you feel about me.
[149:21.30]When has anybody ever turned down or complained about a nice ham sandwich with mustard on it?
[149:27.73]I can't think of anyone.
[149:28.97]I feel like a lot of people would complain about the mustard.
[149:32.01]I don't know.
[149:32.39]I don't think so.
[149:34.07]Not a lot of people are into the mustard.
[149:36.21]I think a ham sandwich isn't versatile.
[149:38.61]Just any occasion.
[149:40.58]It's always a good choice.
[149:44.08]Okay.
[149:44.36]Alright.
[149:48.34]What dessert am I?
[149:54.34]What dessert are you?
[149:55.42]What dessert am I?
[149:57.95]Honest to goodness, I don't even know that many desserts.
[150:02.07]Listen, you're a cream pie?
[150:10.60]You're a creme brulee.
[150:12.76]Ooh, okay.
[150:14.56]Because you hide all of the good stuff.
[150:18.72]You have to, like, crack through the hard exterior to get to, like, what you're really thinking.
[150:24.82]What's really going on in that psycho brain of yours.
[150:28.36]Why are you making me out to be, like, intrusive thoughts, Andy?
[150:32.32]What is this, like, you're analyzing me.
[150:37.35]You asked.
[150:43.21]Do me, do me.
[150:44.13]Okay, okay, okay.
[150:45.55]Um...
[150:50.62]You're... You're an amazing... You're an amazing... You're an amazing... Just... Just vanilla cone.
[151:00.63]You know what I mean?
[151:01.45]Just a soft serve vanilla cone.
[151:04.53]That's somebody sprinkled bacon bits on it.
[151:07.83]Come on.
[151:17.06]I'm still unlocked.
[151:17.76]I don't know what the fuck that means.
[151:20.51]Do people put bacon on ice cream?
[151:22.69]They do.
[151:24.67]You do.
[151:27.17]You would.
[151:32.44]I would.
[151:33.14]Would I?
[151:33.42]I think you would.
[151:34.24]I don't think I would.
[151:34.88]I don't think I would.
[151:35.84]I just, I love vanilla ice cream.
[151:37.90]That's top tier for me.
[151:38.90]I feel like if you put stuff on it, you're fucking with the recipe.
[151:44.38]I think that you're a Oreo ice cream.
[151:50.69]don't don't don't I have a history you don't like I'm talking about cookies and cream yeah uh I am also talking about cookies and cream when I was a young boy we're gonna take it all it must have been like second third grade young boy my brother we went over to like a do you not want to hear the story no I do like walk no no I just I wanted to make sure I was ready when you were um
[152:15.55]It was like Easter.
[152:16.41]So they had like those like Hershey's like Easter egg wrapped like cookies and cream like candies.
[152:22.94]Yeah.
[152:23.74]And I ate a whole bunch of them and they made me so sick that like since then like cookies and cream and like the Oreo filling kind of grossed me out.
[152:33.65]and because I have a brother and it's like a brother's job to gross you out he like knew that so he would started eating um he started taking all of the cream out of an entire bag of oreos made a baseball out of them and then like showed it to me and ate it and it grossed me out so much did you puke
[152:57.75]From the original, like eating the candy, the Easter candy.
[153:00.71]Yeah, I did puke.
[153:02.65]That's awful.
[153:03.81]No, that's understandable.
[153:06.65]So for you to tell me I am a cookies and cream.
[153:10.34]Yeah.
[153:12.62]That's traumatic.
[153:16.80]I have cookies and cream trauma.
[153:23.54]Jesus.
[153:26.25]You guys are the puke twins.
[153:27.59]You're going to want to pick this up.
[153:36.24]Dude, you just take it.
[153:37.80]You need it too.

[154:22.60]Looks like you guys are on drugs tonight.
[154:25.51]Looks like you did something.
[154:28.11]This is much more better than the... God damn it.
[154:33.65]The bow is... I didn't like the bow very much.
[154:36.91]Yeah.
[154:38.61]Be like lightning zapper.
[154:40.45]Yeah.
[154:40.71]Alright.
[154:47.42]We're going to do it this time.
[154:59.29]we're doing it uh here here's what actually happened I'm going crit earlier you weren't paying attention because I asked you a question and I picked up two of the crit gems which is why I gave you two of the health gems oh I see so so if we get crit again let me get the crit stuff I will make sense let me in there and I'm gonna I'm gonna keep taking like crit lightning
[155:27.15]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[155:30.30]I mean, poison stacks one, poison stacks one.
[155:36.64]Do these actually stack though?
[155:38.81]It does say stack, so I would have to assume it stacks.
[155:41.17]You have to assume that, right?
[155:42.41]You have to assume it.
[155:54.22]if you could pick any element that became alive and could be your friend what would it be any element like are you saying like a like an ember fire head element would be your friend I mean like like helium like hydrogen oh yeah okay I'm thinking fantasy
[156:19.80]What kind of golem would I like to have?
[156:23.96]I just wanted to confuse you for a moment.
[156:25.76]I'm sorry.
[156:26.18]I'm pretty confused.
[156:28.82]Especially when your example is Helium.
[156:31.52]Could Helium come alive and be my friend?
[156:34.45]I feel like that is not even one of the strangest things we've talked about today.
[156:42.01]I think it is.
[156:43.27]It might be, but is it?
[156:44.81]You don't want this?
[156:45.75]You want some skill damage?
[156:47.55]I'll take it.
[156:53.66]uh gold is the most precious of metals oh yeah so you could you could melt your friend down and sell it yeah monster who needs friends when you've got money am I right
[157:33.50]this is a Disney villain plot you could you have the power to turn people into gold but then they have to be your friend
[158:02.05]Dude, we are so powerful.
[158:04.60]We're actually doing pretty good.
[158:05.42]This is the first stream that I've caught in a long time and they have a case of the weirds.
[158:14.84]I think for both of us, this is the first stream in a long time.
[158:18.32]I think we're just usually weird.
[158:22.15]I think we're just messing around.
[158:26.13]I've been very honest, open, and vulnerable tonight.
[158:29.39]Yeah.
[158:35.20]Messing around.
[158:37.20]Just a little bit of a joke.
[158:38.26]You guys are fun to watch.
[158:40.72]Hey, cool.
[158:46.02]We're glad you picked it.
[158:58.72]Do you want to be faster?
[158:59.81]I feel like I've gotten like three of these.
[159:03.93]Okay.
[159:04.03]Just eat them up.
[159:05.05]Stats?
[159:05.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[159:06.15]Skill?
[159:07.97]You happy with your skills?
[159:09.21]I am happy with these.
[159:10.21]I don't think I need to change them.
[159:24.24]did that room we were in that room for like 30 milliseconds I was gonna say you know seconds are too long um they didn't give me the crit gem I was gonna say can you reroll no there was a there was like a perk for that but I don't think I took it what's your guys favorite chips I actually have the answer to this if anybody wants to know it a lot of you already know
[159:53.72]I've got chip-related trauma.
[159:57.12]So there's another story?
[159:59.46]Did your brother mush up a bunch of sun chips?
[160:03.82]When I was really young, my brother, he's older, and his friend, they're older.
[160:10.18]I'm the younger brother.
[160:11.06]He made a sun chip baseball.
[160:16.58]My brother's friend was like, man, I could really go for some chips right now.
[160:19.43]And I was super into it, too.
[160:20.81]And I was like, yeah, I could go for some chips.
[160:23.05]and then I found out like an hour later after this whole like chip debacle that they weren't talking about chocolate chips and I felt very foolish I mean that that kind of ruined my life honestly I feel like you were I feel like you were implying oh oh double you're gonna want to focus up for the phalanx rose
[161:12.01]You do more damage than I do.
[161:14.15]You've taken all the damage items.
[161:15.95]You've taken all the damage gems.
[161:17.87]Oh, okay.
[161:18.53]Now it's my fault that I'm doing more damage.
[161:20.29]Can you fucking eat this meat?
[161:22.78]Okay, so what is your favorite chip?
[161:25.70]Favorite chip?
[161:27.22]No.
[161:28.52]Dude, I'm not really a chip guy.
[161:30.40]At all?
[161:35.55]Not really.
[161:37.68]I mean, it's got to go with something.
[161:39.10]And then at that point, it's more about what it's going with than the actual chip.
[161:43.34]You know, it's like a delivery device.
[161:45.51]And then I don't really care anymore.
[161:46.97]Max relics.
[161:51.33]Uh-oh.
[161:56.30]Shit.
[161:56.54]I have to get rid of this.
[162:00.56]Can I even get rid of this?
[162:06.36]can I drop a relic because I I just thought you farted I thought that was a huge fart I was like why did you play that over the mic I thought that was the fart reverb sound oh I misunderstood this one too I don't really want it I just I'm I have I guess I'll take it it's weird
[162:33.42]If you can use that ticket, I apparently... Why couldn't you?
[162:37.33]I have full relic slots, apparently.
[162:41.13]How?
[162:42.57]I don't know.
[162:42.91]I only have... I have two?
[162:44.59]Okay, I have four relics.
[162:51.71]I can't go down to the second slot.
[162:54.41]You already have that relic.
[162:56.53]Oh, I can't have more than one?
[162:58.43]Yeah.
[162:59.35]Oh.
[162:59.88]I thought you could just kind of stack them.
[163:09.60]so you're not a chip guy are you any type of salty snack kind of what what does that uh I mean like I I like chips but like I was thinking it has to go with something so it's more about what it goes with like I'll have chips with cottage cheese is you know like a consistent thing for me you know if you're in like a like nachos with something that sounds cool do you do salt and pepper on cottage cheese no no but you that's you would like it
[163:51.99]What are you gonna cook for me?
[163:55.40]What do you want?
[163:57.08]What do you like cooking?
[163:59.06]What do you want?
[164:00.78]I want what you like cooking.
[164:03.45]salmon every time every time someone's like oh I like cooking and I cook this all the time and then I see them and I'm like hey cool like you know cooking's cool I'll even help I'm not like asking to be like served but like I like to see what people are into and what they're cooking good looking uh I like you want the damage too you might as well take it
[164:28.65]I mean, that's a very broad question.
[164:30.57]I mean, what do you feel like today?
[164:32.45]Are you in a seafood mood?
[164:33.75]I want what you like.
[164:36.05]I want to experience you.
[164:39.23]Okay.
[164:39.37]It's not about me.
[164:40.81]So if I were to make food, I don't know what I would do.
[164:46.62]pretty good pasta salad right now that's what I would probably have like a specialty like oh yeah I cook this I do like a real good job salmon egg salad I make a mean egg salad I make a good salmon in the oven uh a good cod in the pan I'm a uh I'm a big fan of um
[165:05.08]do you make an egg salad I actually do or is that kind of like making cereal where you just sort of put the milk and the cereal together yeah it kind of is but there's some secrets
[165:19.54]Okay, I didn't know.
[165:23.44]I'm certainly not a pasta salad kind of guy.
[165:27.61]Pasta salad is a great, quick, and simple meal.
[165:33.25]And I said meal because if you put a bunch of broccoli in pasta salad, olives and shit, get everything in there.
[165:41.31]Make it a whole thing.
[165:43.34]Pasta, broccoli, olives.
[165:47.04]Tuna.
[165:48.40]Get it all in there.
[165:51.71]But you're a salmon person.
[165:54.09]I do like salmon a lot, yes.
[165:56.01]I kind of feel like anyone who likes salmon, their taste buds are just fucked up.
[166:00.01]There's probably 500 billion people in the universe.
[166:04.22]I'm talking multi around each universe.
[166:07.18]I'm not talking about just Earth.
[166:09.38]Just actually gasp when you said that.
[166:12.66]I know I'm aware like when I go to the grocery store sometimes I like to buy the like they have like the pre-made like here he goes like pre-made package like ready to go like ham like the the pork that I left in my backpack yeah uh other room we don't need to heal uh it's always like three dishes of pork and then the rest everything else like a hundred options of salmon I feel like they're just trying to get rid of this
[166:39.11]Like there's a warehouse somewhere with just like way too much salmon in it.
[166:43.13]I mean, it's probably one of the most popular foods in the world, I would say.
[166:49.77]I mean, I don't know what the statistics in the United States are.
[166:53.20]Salmon is very, very, very popular.
[166:55.46]It's like a staple of a lot of people's diets, I think, a lot.
[167:00.96]Fish, cod, salmon, haddock.
[167:05.98]Those are staples.
[167:08.70]I feel like if you had to have tuna, salmon would be like lowest on my list.
[167:16.40]Do you like tuna?
[167:17.10]Like absolute bottom.
[167:20.21]No.
[167:20.67]No, really?
[167:21.37]I feel like I'd rather have tuna.
[167:25.79]But okay, what about tuna fish from the can?
[167:30.13]that sounds disgusting yeah I'll take the salmon no no no no no no people just have such a bad opinion of salmon out of the can and it's just you just gotta you gotta trust me you just gotta hold your nose no you just gotta you have to trust me alright everyone be quiet
[168:07.53]He's going to freeze you.
[168:10.06]You're getting hit.
[168:14.10]You're just standing still.
[168:17.08]Stop making me make jokes that aren't funny.
[168:22.77]I would love it if you made funny jokes.
[168:26.37]This ain't on me.
[168:44.83]He's just hitting.
[168:45.87]He's landing them on me, not you.
[168:47.43]Oh, you got them.
[169:14.51]Yeah, I do.
[169:22.25]Epic.
[169:24.07]I will die on this hill.
[169:26.49]Two and a fish.
[169:27.49]Out of the can.
[169:28.78]Solid.
[169:29.26]Like, you get a good solid albacore tuna.
[169:34.16]And you're going to take that.
[169:35.12]You're going to mix it, obviously, with mayo.
[169:38.52]interrupting your favorite fish though is your favorite fish salmon or tuna it realistically is probably tuna it's probably tuna fish like all all seafood like even like we're talking like crab lobster I like crab I don't like lobster weirdly enough I actually don't really like um lobster at all um probably probably uh probably weird for this one
[170:07.66]But I think if I had to have any seafood, of all things, it's calamari.
[170:12.74]See, now you lost me big time.
[170:14.74]I don't know how you will think that eating squid is fine, but salmon is gross to you.
[170:20.28]How?
[170:21.26]It doesn't make any sense.
[170:21.98]It just tastes weird.
[170:23.42]How does it make any sense?
[170:25.25]Squid has such a distinct, odd flavor.
[170:31.15]Not really.
[170:32.11]It does.
[170:34.84]salmon and if you they're both seafood right but how do you like calamari but you don't you hate salmon it's just it's salmon just tastes weird like sign me up for like almost any other fish really that's really I think tuna fish and pretzels I know I've changed at least a few people's lives here
[171:00.70]I just have my life was law.
[171:03.34]I was living a shallow existence.
[171:05.29]I was drama stream.
[171:06.91]He said he said he what?
[171:09.15]What was it?
[171:10.78]tuna fish so I'm talking canned tuna you take it out of the container you mix it up like make a tuna like like as if you were gonna put it in like a sandwich I'm talking tuna fish sandwich tuna fish you put mayo mix it up add whatever you want to make it the way you want it but you no actually don't do that just do it normally and take pretzel sticks pretzel cylinders wait I'm confused because I just had to throw out the first half of the recipe
[171:38.31]I read the recipe and step five was throw out the first half.
[171:41.54]Okay.
[171:42.54]It's not drunk food.
[171:44.12]It's not high food.
[171:46.10]It's not drunk food.
[171:47.44]It's just good shit.
[171:48.50]I'm telling you.
[171:49.22]A lot of people just write it off and they don't even give it a chance.
[171:57.71]This one's probably good.
[172:02.00]Something to do with the way the pretzels interact with the tuna fish.
[172:05.97]I don't know what it is.
[172:07.71]There's gonna- Somebody that's in the science community, please.
[172:11.07]Help us.
[172:11.27]Someone who knows science, tell me why I like this food.
[172:13.85]No, I'm serious.
[172:14.97]It changes.
[172:15.81]It's weird.
[172:17.84]It changes completely.
[172:25.40]I understand it's so good.
[172:27.34]Exactly.
[172:33.15]The combination is... It's relentlessly good.
[172:40.24]It's the salt?
[172:51.50]No, no, it can't be.
[173:01.19]It's the molecular interaction between the salt, the bread, and the fish.
[173:08.64]You must just like sodium.
[173:12.50]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[173:13.16]Hold on a second.
[173:13.82]Check it out.
[173:14.50]Scientist in chat.
[173:16.54]The pretzels contain an enzyme called forazine that reacts with tuna proteins.
[173:22.17]Since they're long-chain proteins, they tend to spool, and it creates a stringy... What?
[173:27.25]I just didn't... I did read something fucked up.
[173:33.99]I didn't just read something like fucked up, right?
[173:37.19]I don't know.
[173:38.07]I don't know.
[173:38.61]Neither do I. If we're going to keep talking about tuna and shit, I'm checking out.
[173:48.10]It's so good.
[173:48.74]I know people like...
[173:51.26]a hater I'm a hater I hate him but just if you ever have an opportunity and you just like you're if you're at like the grocery store and just like you're in the tuna and pretzel aisle it's just like the tuna and pretzel aisle I fucking hate that guy but uh you know what fuck him I want to prove him wrong buy it prove me wrong tell me I'm wrong
[174:18.05]and you're gonna fucking bite into it and it's gonna be like a five gum commercial.
[174:25.07]It's gonna be like... I'm lost.
[174:38.32]I don't know what's going on.
[174:40.15]I can't participate in this conversation.
[174:44.67]Which X-Men would you fuck?

[176:02.47]Wait, you want this one?
[176:07.51]Stop ignoring chat.
[176:08.89]I mean, I already am so absent-minded when I'm playing a game like this anyways.
[176:13.62]I'm just going to lose if I look over there more than a few times every minute or two.
[176:16.82]Alright, take them both.
[176:22.42]Ooh, I'm gaining power.

[178:36.57]Uh, Moon Veil.
[178:37.11]I want to piss everyone off on fucking Moon Veil.
[178:41.55]That would be the Sword of Night and Flame.
[178:57.03]I would be the sword of night and flame yeah well I would be the moon veil and I would talk to my wielder and in between like combat they'd pause for like 10 seconds and we'd get to have the anime moment where they're like I don't know what to do and I I'm the sword and I'm like you need to look within you son and we'd have the whole conversation you need to do a charged attack idiot again do another one more one more charged attack with moon veil
[179:26.24]You know, I used Moonvale for half that playthrough when I had my first playthrough.
[179:32.83]It was fun.
[179:36.55]You should get that.
[179:37.25]Looking a little low.
[179:51.80]You know what happened today?
[179:53.22]And I blame you for this.
[179:55.08]You started the call.
[179:56.02]You blame me for literally everything.
[179:58.24]No, I'm blaming you.
[180:00.14]You fucked everything up.
[180:00.96]Because you came in here and said, I just want to tell you, I'm going to be very normal.
[180:04.84]I'm not going to be weird.
[180:06.48]There's not going to be any weird.
[180:07.74]And that messed up my brain.
[180:09.52]And now we had to be weird.
[180:11.28]Oh, so you were like, okay, now that he's not going to be entertaining and carry my stream for me, I might have to pull some weight.
[180:17.49]Don't tell anybody that.
[180:20.60]you you thought oh I'm gonna have to start on it's gonna be hilarious we're just kind of like I'm just gonna get to chill and play some like whatever and then I I started by saying nope not today I just I don't I don't know like funnier than you sorry dude tell a joke tell a joke
[180:56.10]that would joke right now alright I hate that I hate when someone's like tell a joke that's the worst thing is there anything worse in the whole universe um I don't know maybe ordering pickup at a restaurant
[181:21.72]I always feel like I fuck up when I second guess everything I just say.
[181:28.56]What?
[181:29.20]I feel like I just screw up every time.
[181:30.34]It's just like, oh, hey, yeah, what can I get you?
[181:32.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[181:35.05]You know the internet happened, right?
[181:37.61]You don't like, you don't, no one orders pickup anymore on the phone.
[181:40.77]What are you talking about?
[181:42.53]You call the place?
[181:46.23]But, I mean, yeah.
[181:48.01]Yeah.
[181:51.86]Not every single restaurant in the world operates on like fucking Uber.
[181:56.72]What are you talking about?
[181:59.14]Yeah, they do.
[182:04.05]Boomer.
[182:20.94]oh yeah that was good this is like this this is the equivalent of the airplane food kind of like no one like when you call the place to order food who who does that who's relating to this how but do you order every single time from like an app or a website I I haven't called a place to order since like
[182:46.71]The... 2001 or something?
[182:48.95]I don't... But here's the thing about ordering sometimes through those apps.
[182:52.95]It can get weird.
[182:54.33]Because sometimes... How can it get weird?
[182:55.39]Because sometimes it's just... It's listed fucking weirdly.
[182:58.47]And it's like, wait.
[182:59.66]That's not... That's listed kind of not correctly.
[183:03.94]Like, it's like, wait a minute.
[183:04.60]I have to check like five boxes.
[183:07.36]But wait, that's not how the thing's listed on the actual restaurant.
[183:10.76]It can be weird.
[183:13.04]I feel like I know exactly what I'm getting when I call.
[183:19.20]They can be listed bizarrely.
[183:21.06]Sometimes you don't even know what meat is in a sandwich, for instance.
[183:23.52]You're just like, oh, this one's like a number three.
[183:25.10]It's like, wait, what is that?
[183:27.16]What's in it?
[183:29.08]I don't know.
[183:29.70]I need to know.
[183:30.45]I need to find out what's in the number three.
[183:32.61]Can't you read?
[183:33.83]Yeah.
[183:38.43]Yeah.
[183:39.79]Are you gonna make an offering?
[183:41.27]Yeah, giving him 400 gold.
[183:49.88]I actually gave it 250.
[183:50.78]And he gave me a broken jar.
[183:56.04]I got more health.
[183:58.13]He gave me a useless broken jar for 400.
[184:06.02]But no, honestly though, a lot of times, I feel like it's... I know exactly... Like, oh, so hey, what comes on that, by the way?
[184:14.10]Like, oh, this, this, this, and this.
[184:15.30]Okay, good.
[184:16.22]That's what I want.
[184:17.64]I'm going to take the L and just admit that one of my least favorite things in life is being on the phone.
[184:27.34]I actually don't mind it.
[184:30.68]But I know what you mean, though.
[184:36.39]like if I think I was saying not that long ago one of the greatest inventions ever or like the greatest modern trends is that everything that you can order food is like done through an app and you don't have to talk to someone like I'd give up so much technology to never have to talk on the phone about the food I want you should eat this
[184:58.97]I mean, you're talking about convenience.
[185:01.82]It's much more convenient for you to not have to do that, right?
[185:04.86]I get it.
[185:06.02]I feel the same way a lot of times, right?
[185:07.52]But I...
[185:10.57]I have also used those apps before and no fault of the restaurant or even like the driver, it doesn't matter, right?
[185:19.93]No fault of anybody.
[185:21.38]It's just kind of wrong.
[185:23.26]And stuff doesn't come out right.
[185:27.34]I much prefer being able to know exactly like by somebody on the phone.
[185:30.56]It's like telling me what I'm going to be getting.
[185:32.64]It's trust issues.
[185:34.12]It's a trust issue here that you have.
[185:36.16]Focus up.
[185:37.14]This is... Wait, is this the guy?
[185:39.93]What was this?
[185:44.11]Alright, no, this is the guy.
[185:45.17]This is the guy.
[185:46.35]Focus up on the guy.
[185:48.41]I need you for the final phase.
[185:49.63]I almost just dove into him.
[185:53.31]Oh my god, dude, stop.
[185:54.09]I don't know what's happening with my brain.
[186:00.16]Okay, for you, I'm going to suggest actually that you think less.
[186:04.84]Actually helpful.
[186:25.88]Watch out for this goal I just oh you remember what your roll button is.
[186:35.91]I just stopped talking.
[186:36.57]It's gonna help I don't know.
[186:43.01]What is he doing?
[186:51.16]Ah, you went sicko mode on me.
[186:53.70]I'm dead!
[187:04.39]You're going to have to win this.
[187:06.57]I'm dead.
[187:12.75]I don't even know if I could have moved fast enough to get to where you were.
[187:33.34]He's healing, dude.
[187:34.14]He's healing.
[187:35.32]Aim at it.
[187:37.12]You need to be quiet.
[187:40.83]You got to focus.
[187:46.75]Everything will be forgiven if you can win.
[187:49.05]Everything you've ever done.
[187:51.59]Everything?
[187:52.09]Everything?
[187:52.39]Okay.
[187:53.26]Literally everything you've ever done.
[188:11.36]Hit him.
[188:11.66]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[188:16.03]Dodge these balls.
[188:19.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[188:20.49]Take your time.
[188:20.97]You got all day, man.
[188:24.01]He's choosing.
[188:24.49]He's choosing.
[188:32.60]You've got him right where you want him.
[188:35.98]Oh, I like that.
[188:36.56]The chakra there.
[188:37.30]It almost got both of those.
[188:39.06]Dodge this.
[188:49.46]Counterclockwise!
[188:53.76]Oh, this is easy.
[188:58.43]Only an idiot would die to this.
[189:13.66]He's gonna juice.
[189:22.10]Uh-oh.
[189:22.80]Just focus on dodging, man.
[189:27.14]You've got this, pal.
[189:29.00]Come on, Buster.
[189:30.66]Let's fucking go, dude.
[189:33.18]Stop talking to me.
[189:35.87]Watch out.
[189:36.37]There's a thing shooting green balls at the top.
[189:43.40]He's juicing!
[189:46.59]Chakra!
[189:46.97]Chakra!
[189:47.91]Stop it!
[189:48.21]Chakra!
[189:48.91]I don't care what he's doing, man!
[189:50.11]Abilities!
[189:50.33]Use your abilities!
[189:58.95]Focus on dodging.
[190:01.70]There we go.
[190:03.26]Alright, Buster.
[190:04.58]You got this.
[190:05.18]Final phase is easy.
[190:06.68]You can totally dodge the yellow beam, even if you're standing behind him.
[190:33.69]Uh-oh.
[190:34.01]Uh-oh.
[190:35.71]He's healing.
[190:36.31]One more hit.
[190:37.01]You took all the damage.
[190:38.87]You took all the damage.
[190:40.31]Shit.
[190:53.84]Damn it!
[190:54.14]I hate to see it.
[190:56.04]I couldn't even fucking hurt him!
[191:05.37]Sorry.
[191:06.73]You still didn't beat my damage.
[191:09.15]No, because you picked up almost every single damage gem in the game!
[191:14.70]that sounds true that sounds totally true and definitely a way to like get yourself out of this but now you're not forgiven for all of your sins when you die god's gonna look upon your record look at this moment but I tried that's the part that's sad hey watch it
[191:44.76]Your relic selectors?
[191:46.94]Ooh.

[192:16.19]Uh, what is this new weapon?
[192:19.11]Oh, Hammer Man.
[192:20.23]I actually like this.
[192:32.24]I want to be Hammer Man.
[192:35.62]I want to be Hammer Guy.
[192:39.16]How about we both be Hammer Guy?
[192:41.48]Do you think that you're powerful enough to wield it?
[192:47.34]maybe if I had one crit gem the whole game or one damage okay okay I'll bow down to you we gotta go talk to this guy I'll use the bow what is that strange energy this game's fun I like it yeah nice little buster beat him up
[193:15.93]So we are identifying these?
[193:17.57]Dude, did we seriously not give him any ever?
[193:27.26]Because we had so many of these on our previous run.
[193:29.54]Oh my god, we really didn't.
[193:32.14]These are now available on your journey.
[193:34.36]Oops.
[193:35.14]That's a lot of new things.
[193:36.63]I'm not gonna read them.
[193:37.47]I don't care.
[193:38.89]We'll find them.
[193:40.07]There's more.
[193:46.01]Next.
[193:49.17]Next.
[193:50.99]OK.
[193:52.19]Oh cool, nice.
[193:53.84]OK, let me.
[193:56.26]Did you read the details of the hammer?
[193:58.50]I did.
[194:01.94]So all of the attacks can be charged so you can go 1-2-1-2-3 and they're all they're all different.
[194:12.64]try bow I think bow looks bad but I'm gonna use it I'm gonna I'm gonna be the bow guy I actually probably should use this okay so okay like if I'm very realistic I probably should use this okay let's go then I'm hammer guy
[194:36.82]me too alright what are you doing pick the hammer we need to be the hammer no I don't want to be the hammer brother I don't want a mirror match right now fine don't complain to me when there's no funny material that we can do like a Super Mario thing together god damn it
[195:05.88]Okay.
[195:06.64]I wasn't even supposed to have face cam on today.
[195:08.04]Do you think that you can legally become someone's brother?
[195:15.47]You know what I'm saying?
[195:17.09]Like, do you think we could go to a court and I could become your brother?
[195:21.85]Uh, probably, yeah.
[195:24.29]I think, yeah.
[195:25.49]What's this?
[195:27.97]Huh?
[195:29.49]Oh, he's sexy.
[195:35.24]Looks like the fucking- the things that you ride in Golden Axe.
[195:39.80]That's a reference.
[195:46.29]He's- he's- wait, were you killing him?
[195:47.97]Wait, are you strong now?
[195:48.67]I don't- I don't know what- you skip- you- this is the only time you've- Okay, you read it.
[195:51.95]You make fun of me every time I read something, every time we play together.
[195:54.99]You try and like, oh, like, oh wow, like, really?
[195:57.41]Okay.
[195:59.20]Okay, like, doing me a favor and reading the thing on stream for me, alright?
[196:03.10]Kinda weird.
[196:06.83]What'd you do?
[196:07.13]What happened?
[196:09.94]You went where?
[196:10.34]You went somewhere last night?
[196:12.58]Yeah.
[196:24.74]Ooh, there's skills up here.
[196:26.26]Skills up here.
[196:26.72]I don't like the bow.
[196:33.28]It takes a lot.
[196:34.04]Are you using keyboard and mouse, right?
[196:35.36]So that probably would be better for you.
[196:37.59]It's helpful, but I don't like the standing still.
[196:40.69]Hammer seems amazing, by the way.
[196:43.15]It did seem that way.
[196:44.01]Wait, what do we got?
[196:44.81]Frost Wall?
[196:46.27]Or Arcane Bolts?
[196:49.35]I'll take Bolts.
[196:52.11]I like this one.
[196:54.31]Okay.
[196:55.92]Now I have two things I don't like.
[196:58.16]God!
[196:58.70]Do you want to start over?
[196:59.54]No!
[196:59.62]No!
[197:02.53]I want to overcome.
[197:12.08]Yeah, standing still tends to get you shot.
[197:15.26]It's kind of rough.
[197:17.64]Skills refresh quicker.
[197:20.16]I'll take burn.
[197:21.00]I haven't done burn.
[197:21.64]You did burn.
[197:22.22]That's pretty good.
[197:26.64]Guess I'll take it.
[197:29.36]Money or ember?
[197:34.09]It's always money, man.
[197:36.03]It's what it's all about.
[197:37.05]How come that one chatter got a Roblox birthday, but I haven't gotten a Minecraft party?
[197:49.05]They want to sweepstakes.
[198:10.99]I'm the one who's firing ice now.
[198:12.65]It's fun.
[198:17.42]Yeah, they call me Frostburn.
[198:19.44]When were the sweepstakes?
[198:20.76]It was me looking over and reading a name and deciding that I was going to do the thing that one moment.
[198:41.22]That was so brave of you.
[198:42.38]That's a good move.
[198:46.87]By the way.
[198:53.93]Your healing is increased.
[198:55.49]Your skills have an additional charge.
[198:57.73]These are all amazing.
[198:59.25]First perfect skill.
[199:04.94]man that's 25 more damage for five seconds for the I mean that that is it bad you're gonna you're gonna do a perfect skill it's objectively bad because the only rooms that matter are the boss rooms and then it's only damage one time in a boss room well I mean look at this thing right here that's perfect for me love that for me works for my build
[199:36.34]So you're right, this is kind of like Hades.
[199:41.59]The only thing that I haven't seen that much of is the leveling up skills, but I feel like it's in the game, right?
[199:50.06]Uh, I don't know.
[199:50.96]I know there's like more stuff in the hub we haven't unlocked for sure.
[199:53.74]When does Hades 2 come out of wherever it is?
[199:57.08]I don't think they set a date.
[200:09.32]Hey, dude, when is the five minutes of Freddy's?
[200:11.22]I got to wake up early tomorrow.
[200:12.44]I don't know.
[200:16.69]We could go later than usual because I woke up at 3 p.m.
[200:19.07]today on like a, you know, like a full degen mode.
[200:22.03]So I'm not like a bedtime Andy type of guy today.
[200:25.01]Okay.
[200:37.08]I do like about the bow that nothing attacks me and you fight everything.
[200:42.99]It is kind of nice.
[200:55.97]Although it's kind of hard against bosses.
[201:00.93]Why?
[201:01.01]Because it's very slow.
[201:02.95]No, no, no.
[201:03.14]I'm talking about the hammer.
[201:05.25]It's kind of slow.
[201:06.64]Charge it up, pal.
[201:11.18]That does help.
[201:37.56]Whoa!
[201:51.12]Nice work there.
[201:55.80]Thanks.
[201:57.46]You need more max health.
[201:59.36]Do I?
[202:04.62]Do I?
[202:10.54]gained five armor I feel like I did that a lot try it no what do you mean no ah god fine take it I'm the one that's getting hit you said it yourself you've been just ah I know go ahead I I'm the one that's in front of everything I guess and now I'm distracted and look what's happening
[202:41.98]Just talking about how I have no health.
[202:46.71]Fine.
[202:47.37]God.
[202:51.89]Mom said we needed to share.
[202:54.18]Big brother.
[203:16.07]Oh, oh.
[203:20.91]I'm a blast bomber.
[203:22.99]Ember fire, that's the name of the game.
[203:33.13]It's kind of.
[203:36.41]I used more.
[203:37.23]Yeah, OK, so this thing is going to be good.
[203:40.00]I am not the big brother.
[203:41.28]Jerma is like 10 years older than me.
[203:43.46]Not even remotely accurate.
[204:03.87]Stats or health?
[204:07.64]Definitely stats.
[204:08.42]I don't know what this... There's some secret over here, dude.
[204:10.70]Oh, you eat that.
[204:15.51]Yeah, big boy.
[204:16.17]Eat that protein.
[204:36.04]I'm not vibing with the whole bow situation.
[204:38.64]You're not vibing right now?
[204:41.50]I am not vibing.
[204:42.46]I have to find a way to make it work.
[204:48.68]I feel like I'm just going to do skill damage because why not?
[204:53.37]If you cast that fire on meat, it will cook it and do more healing.
[204:56.53]Really?
[204:56.71]That's cool.
[204:58.19]I'm going to test that.
[204:58.93]It could be a life.
[205:05.81]you ever just like order something on an app and then like it comes raw and you're like man if I would have just called them and told them in person what I wanted they wouldn't have cooked it they would like cooked it right it's just raw yeah ever happen to you nope
[205:31.04]So what did that dinosaur even tell us?
[205:33.40]YouTube, is he being angry?
[205:35.60]Wait, don't move.
[205:36.76]Oh, never mind.
[205:43.28]I have no idea what the dinosaur told us.
[205:55.48]Beware.
[206:23.06]yeah you're gonna you're gonna want to beware stunned did you just put that bomb down yeah I've got the bomb ability you see a bomb it's my bomb
[206:57.51]Epic.
[207:01.47]Can you wash your hands?
[207:02.89]Did you take them both?
[207:05.95]There was only one after a boss.
[207:08.54]I took one.
[207:10.28]Because I'm low health.
[207:12.18]And you commented about it and I've been insecure ever since.
[207:16.92]Who's your favorite Angry Bird?
[207:19.30]I've never played Angry Bird.
[207:26.50]Congrats on the MVP.
[207:41.11]Oof, Sturm.
[207:42.21]I'm sorry.
[207:43.07]Some people haven't experienced everything in the whole world.
[207:46.27]There's some things that some people just don't have experiences with.
[207:50.51]And Angry Birds, sorry, is one of them for me.
[207:55.07]Didn't see the movie.
[207:56.30]I know that it's a critically acclaimed masterpiece, but I just I just missed out on it, you know?
[208:13.89]That was quick.
[208:15.89]There's no way we don't beat that boss now.
[208:19.04]I feel weak.
[208:26.36]Whenever you defeat an enemy, refresh a skill, that seems unbelievable.
[208:31.51]It does.
[208:35.43]Uh, yeah.
[208:36.65]Uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[208:38.23]I'm just going to let you kill everything.
[208:42.05]I'll stand in the back.
[208:43.73]And then we're going to get to the boss and you're going to have 700% weapon damage.
[208:45.85]Better.
[209:00.80]You got him, pal.
[209:02.68]Right there, buddy.
[209:03.56]Just bop me.
[209:04.36]I can't say the word.
[209:05.16]Just bop me up.
[209:06.27]Just bop me.
[209:07.11]Bop me.
[209:10.57]Give me a little boppy.
[209:27.64]Watch out for the magicians.
[209:28.38]I'm aware.
[209:33.42]Oh, boppy.
[209:35.56]You know what?
[209:35.97]Honestly, I feel like I'm fucking going to be the useless one.
[209:39.91]Like +2 damage on a bow.
[209:42.61]When your hammer charge hits like six times.
[209:47.79]I'll be damaged.
[209:52.74]Oh, boppy.
[210:06.49]+2 nice oh yeah you get that kill bud oh yeah champ
[210:30.68]Uh, I'll damage plus one.
[210:32.14]Do you want the max HP?
[210:33.24]You probably take it.
[210:34.00]You actually need it.
[210:37.28]You take it.
[210:38.25]No, seriously, take it.
[210:39.29]You can't.
[210:39.85]You got it.
[210:40.15]We got to have you.
[210:40.73]Look how you look like the Hulk.
[210:43.05]It feels appropriate that you have more health than me because I'm like Hawkeye and you're the Hulk.
[210:47.65]Yeah, but the same shit's going to happen when I was the last one to fight the boss and I had no damage increase.
[210:58.21]That was all my fault.
[210:59.17]I should have died.
[210:59.85]I got hit by, like, everything.
[211:01.07]You know what I mean?
[211:04.21]Like, I just made a couple crucial mistakes.
[211:08.63]I won't let it happen again.
[211:09.72]We got one of those things.
[211:13.98]Doesn't that make you happy?
[211:16.30]I'll learn.
[211:17.10]I'll evolve.
[211:17.92]I'll be better.
[211:20.72]I'll do better.
[211:34.25]Hammer is good.
[211:35.13]Hammer is good.
[211:36.85]You'd like the hammer.
[211:42.18]I believe you.
[211:49.20]Look at my last message to see the curse I placed on you.
[211:52.30]Come on.
[211:56.75]Money?
[211:57.37]I don't think we need money.
[212:01.72]You want the meta?
[212:04.06]We both have over 350 gold.
[212:08.04]Some things cost like 300.
[212:24.15]What does the Ember do?
[212:26.19]That's when we go back to town at the end of the run and upgrade our character.
[212:30.61]Oh, OK.
[212:31.89]You want stats or skills?
[212:34.79]I want a skill.
[212:35.62]I hate my current skills.
[212:58.30]I hate that I have to kill these witches to get it though.
[213:04.80]Really starting to settle into this character.
[213:12.08]Arcane bolts is just so good.
[213:14.26]Again, I don't like either of these.
[213:17.45]Did you get the ability to reroll?
[213:18.99]It's part of the Ember thing.
[213:22.25]No, I didn't.
[213:25.44]Can I drop stuff?
[213:26.54]I can reroll something for you.
[213:27.52]Did not.
[213:28.10]Maybe.
[213:28.48]I don't think you can drop skills.
[213:50.25]I think.
[213:52.34]I used the dice.
[213:53.04]I didn't like it very much.
[213:56.60]You throw it and then it charges up.
[213:57.96]By the time it charges up, the thing was dead.
[213:59.64]Can I just skip?
[214:01.04]You should take Chakram.
[214:03.34]Dude, Chakram was good.
[214:05.20]Unless you like what you have.
[214:06.20]Chakram is good.
[214:09.18]The burn thing is really good, though.
[214:10.46]I'm going to keep what I have.
[214:12.66]Alright.
[214:16.22]Hey, I need a little bit of damage.
[214:21.04]I feel a little weird that somebody just took that item.
[214:23.74]Do you need me?
[214:24.32]Do you want me to help?
[214:25.42]I'm kidding.
[214:27.30]Or am I?
[214:27.64]I don't think you are.
[214:32.42]There's no possible way that everything you say is a joke.
[214:35.36]No.
[214:35.54]Right?
[214:37.28]Like some things you say have to be real and true at some point.
[214:42.02]Yeah.
[214:44.10]It's true.
[214:45.64]You ready?
[214:46.64]I'm ready.
[214:48.19]Is it a double again or just one?
[214:52.08]oh I know this guy he's summoning boys like little snowballs
[215:23.91]We just destroyed that guy.
[215:26.11]Yeah, I feel like he was alive for a very short amount of time.
[215:35.56]I'll get that meat.
[215:36.28]I want to see you eat it.
[215:37.42]Come on.
[215:38.76]Come on, big boy.
[215:41.38]Come on, big boy.
[215:52.46]Nice.
[215:53.94]Thanks for your continued patronage and to maximize our profits.
[215:58.78]To maximize our services.
[215:59.98]You can now re-roll items in the shop.
[216:06.42]Disappear.
[216:09.85]You might take that one.
[216:12.01]I don't like any of these.
[216:16.91]I like this one.
[216:18.47]How do you do the re-roll?
[216:19.97]Talk to him.
[216:24.70]Wait, let me see it real quick.
[216:26.87]Oh, I got a broken jar that I paid $400 for before.
[216:31.81]Secret number nine.
[216:33.23]Good as new.
[216:34.01]Wow.
[216:34.47]It's not worth much to me now that it's empty.
[216:38.83]Your first skill you see in each room grants shield for five seconds that stops projectiles and prevents damage to all knights inside of it.
[216:48.06]I would say that's really good, but it only happens once.
[216:51.94]Yeah.
[216:54.08]I don't know.
[216:54.38]It's kind of like... Prevent damage won't... You know what I mean?
[216:58.10]It's alright.
[216:59.80]Reroll.
[217:02.00]I think you should take Impact Charm.
[217:05.06]That sounds like Hammer would do good with that.
[217:07.42]Does the... Hammer stuns, but... I mean, I guess... I wonder what part of the combo is the stun.
[217:16.49]Is this what you already had every four enemies you defeat?
[217:19.71]Yeah.
[217:21.13]That thing's pretty good.
[217:27.05]is the um is the stun the second or the I think it's the third swing actually hammer applies slow not stun is it everything applies stun it's like everyone has like a stamina bar and if you get the opportunity to get the the shield charge that always stuns you said comb over andy let me make that actually what it is
[217:58.52]You missed!
[217:59.31]You missed!
[218:01.16]Silence!
[218:07.45]Oh, uh, so Holly and I were, um, we watched, uh, we watched The Hunchback of Notre Dame, and the villain in The Hunchback of Notre Dame got us to really think about something.
[218:20.74]If at any point you ever utter the words, silence, you're, you're evil, right?
[218:29.36]Or, enough!
[218:32.18]Silence!
[218:33.12]That's the only... You're evil.
[218:35.99]Nobody has ever uttered that word that followed up with being good.
[218:41.47]Yeah, I'm trying to think of examples.
[218:44.69]Go against that?
[218:45.83]I can't think of anything.
[218:47.07]I don't think there is a single example.
[218:51.41]Silence!
[218:53.09]Unless you're like a kindergarten teacher.
[218:55.45]Maybe.
[218:56.05]Maybe.
[218:56.33]I'm really thinking of outliers.
[219:12.52]What about Gandalf?
[219:14.48]Gandalf says silence?
[219:16.44]He goes, silence!
[219:19.58]Silence!
[219:20.80]Dumbledore says silence?
[219:25.59]Gandalf is evil?
[219:27.79]No, he's not.
[219:28.99]Like, teachers, I feel like are... Teachers and parents are the exception here.
[219:37.54]Silence.
[219:43.45]Gandalf.
[219:48.45]Gandalf is basically a parent.
[219:50.49]Oh, no, no.
[219:50.91]Another thing too.
[219:52.23]If anyone ever says, I will see to this insolence.
[219:56.81]Insolence is another one as well.
[220:01.05]True.
[220:03.45]Villains getting typecast out there.
[220:06.50]They all say the same thing.
[220:09.42]Silence!
[220:10.68]I have had enough of this insolence!
[220:13.14]That means this guy's fucked up and is doing awful shit.
[220:16.72]Terrible things.
[220:23.36]Yeah, well, foolish is... I don't think foolish is there.
[220:31.87]Insolent fools.
[220:33.25]Yeah, actually, maybe you're right.
[220:35.51]That is bad guy speak, isn't it?
[220:40.71]such arrogance you're saying a lot of you're saying a lot of evil guy stuff at the moment you're just thinking oh I was frozen I didn't know wake up wake up
[221:10.91]Somebody said finally.
[221:12.06]I don't think it's finally.
[221:14.68]I think it's at long last.
[221:18.66]It means the same thing, but one of them is inherently more evil.
[221:22.74]Me and you were both the same.
[221:24.82]You're just like me.
[221:26.08]Yep, that's another one.
[221:28.37]Good.
[221:28.79]That's a good one.
[221:30.67]You and I are just alike.
[221:34.33]You and I are the same.
[221:37.63]I'll never be you.
[221:38.53]I'll never be just like you.
[221:40.01]Right?
[221:40.19]Yeah.
[221:40.43]That happens a lot.
[221:46.61]They do exist.
[221:51.27]Why is that funny right now?
[221:56.19]I'm going to die.
[221:56.71]Are you letting that guy hit you?
[221:58.65]I kind of was.
[221:59.61]I got too busy thinking of other things.
[222:05.25]Doing like ad-libs.
[222:06.67]What would a villain say?
[222:10.43]Alright, Ster.
[222:11.88]Yeah.
[222:12.24]I'm going to say what is this from?
[222:15.50]They do exist.
[222:21.67]What?
[222:21.87]It was a good try.
[222:27.48]I have no idea.
[222:28.38]I have no idea.
[222:28.94]What is it?
[222:29.24]It is Santa from the 1998 television commercial, The M&Ms Meet Santa.
[222:38.49]You're right.
[222:38.93]I remember.
[222:40.53]Yeah, you got me.
[222:42.33]Oh, eat up.
[222:43.43]Eat up, big boy.
[222:44.41]Let's fucking go.
[222:48.37]Are you ready?
[222:48.77]Yeah, I'm ready.
[222:49.81]This is it right here.
[222:50.89]I'm ready to annihilate this boss within like five seconds.
[222:55.20]We're going to one phase him.
[222:56.80]Ooh.
[222:57.54]Alright.
[222:59.91]Hold on.
[223:00.15]My underwear is like glued to my ass right now.
[223:31.86]Oh, come on.
[223:33.35]That was unfair.
[223:34.63]Just roll.
[223:42.43]Just roll.
[223:43.53]Why is that him?
[224:17.82]That was unfair.
[224:19.32]That's unfair, dude.
[224:22.14]Isn't it though?
[224:23.20]The only way something could ever penetrate my defenses is with some cheap tactic.
[224:43.76]Oh, that guy's deleted.
[224:49.20]Don't you love it when you, the streamer, read the comment that got deleted?
[224:52.18]You're like, oh, I wasn't supposed to encourage that or something.
[224:55.60]I feel like I do that a lot.
[225:02.43]Why are moderators removing comments?
[225:05.55]Because they break the rules.
[225:07.93]What are the rules?
[225:09.87]You're afraid of someone saying something?
[225:17.70]censorship.
[225:18.30]I feel like I've seen people say like, you're dumb and that doesn't get deleted.
[225:21.76]But what gets deleted is play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[225:27.16]You're going to get MVP every time.
[225:28.91]One of them is an opinion.
[225:29.91]The other one is a demand.
[225:34.47]I think you should play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[225:36.23]That's fine.
[225:36.81]Get rid of him.
[225:38.71]That's an opinion.
[225:40.47]Well, okay.
[225:41.39]I think you should play, not you need to play.
[225:44.10]Exactly.
[225:45.34]Okay.
[225:45.80]But you said get rid of me.
[225:47.60]There was still like a knee jerk get rid of me.
[225:52.35]Silence.
[225:54.59]You insolent cur!
[225:55.61]Cur is another one.
[225:59.98]You vile fiend!
[226:09.04]I kissed my ring.
[226:10.64]They gotta do a character that tells all that, says all that, but it turns out he's not the bad guy.
[226:23.26]Hey, my curse takes effect this boss fight.
[226:26.79]When there's a curse?
[226:27.55]I don't know.
[226:29.93]Insolent.
[226:32.51]Oh, another one is whelped.
[226:34.41]Oh, you insolent whelp.
[226:43.73]you sussy baka also yeah that's also used a lot oh that's good see that's whenever you use a skill gain bonus damage not like once per room I'm not about this once per room
[227:09.04]you sing happy birthday for my daughter it was singing he was hanging down here did you know that me me and Ashley we have a rule when we're watching TV like it's a it's a I think I've maybe even said this before maybe I'm a broken record where if someone in a show starts singing we skip
[227:35.32]You know, you like just press forward like once so it goes like 10 seconds forward.
[227:39.10]If they're still singing, you press it again.
[227:41.03]Just get to the end of it.
[227:43.23]I kind of feel you.
[227:44.33]The only way I think that that does not make sense is if it's a musical.
[227:49.76]Yeah, well, then you're obviously watch the musical and skip every song.
[227:55.74]That would be so funny.
[227:56.42]Three words where they set up the next song, like, oh, yeah, like, oh, and then just go on next.
[228:03.40]Here comes the... Nah, nah, get rid of this.
[228:09.79]Hey, you want to watch the musical, but I kind of don't want to.
[228:14.01]I don't like when people sing.
[228:15.89]I don't like songs...
[228:20.64]You know what my favorite fast time is?
[228:22.03]I've talked about this a lot, but have I ever talked about it with you?
[228:28.90]The whole like hentai thing?
[228:31.89]Pick a movie, and you watch only like two minutes of the movie, and then you go forward.
[228:39.78]How am I supposed to even fucking talk after that one?
[228:42.96]You take a movie, and you watch 10 minutes, and then you skip like 30 minutes, and then watch two minutes.
[228:52.61]Have you actually done this?
[228:54.79]It's fucking fun as hell.
[228:58.50]Why?
[228:59.04]Why?
[228:59.36]Because you can watch any shitty movie you want and it's only like 16 minutes of commitment.
[229:07.53]But you gain nothing.
[229:09.07]No, you get the whole movie.
[229:10.13]Trust me.
[229:11.13]Watch five minutes in the beginning.
[229:13.33]Skip 20 minutes.
[229:15.17]Watch 10 minutes.
[229:16.61]Skip 25 minutes.
[229:18.49]Watch three minutes.
[229:19.97]Skip to the end of the movie.
[229:21.89]It's so fun.
[229:23.51]It's so fun.
[229:25.61]Trust me.
[229:27.72]I feel like I might have done that at some point.
[229:31.58]It's not like intentionally so deliberate in it, but like there's a couple of shows where it's like, I really need to know how this ends, but I'm actually so sick of it and think it's bad.
[229:41.18]You just watch like five minutes of every episode.
[229:44.27]Oh my God.
[229:44.85]I did that with Lucifer.
[229:47.95]I don't know.
[229:49.35]Lucifer, the fucking.
[229:51.25]Wait, hold up.
[229:51.77]Wait, wait, wait.
[229:53.15]Can we talk about it?
[229:54.29]We have to talk about this in detail.
[229:56.65]Can we?
[229:57.21]Yeah.
[229:57.65]Okay.
[229:58.39]Let's make a very, very important point here.
[230:01.15]This is going to be massive spoilers for this show.
[230:03.82]The show Lucifer, right?
[230:05.32]Yeah.
[230:05.82]Yeah.
[230:06.46]So this is big spoilers for Lucifer.
[230:07.98]Huge, huge, massive.
[230:10.38]I want you to talk because I want to see if you and I did the exact same thing.
[230:15.13]I enjoyed it for a bit.
[230:17.94]And then I kind of got the formula and thought every episode was boring, but there's like five minutes of interesting content every episode.
[230:25.12]So I would skip to the middle, watch two minutes, skip to the very end of the episode, watch two minutes, next episode.
[230:31.96]That was a little more egregious.
[230:34.22]But yes, that is exactly what I'm talking about doing.
[230:37.98]I... Okay, this is a huge spoiler.
[230:41.74]So massive Lucifer spoilers.
[230:43.40]I'm serious.
[230:44.23]I'm going to write it on the screen.
[230:47.31]um so I how many episodes are in the first season of lucifer I I I mean who I don't know let's say it's like let's say assume 10 let's just say it's 10. I hold on actually I feel like it's one of those shows that has like 20 episode seasons but the first one might have been like seven I think it was more like a season one pilot kind of thing
[231:14.02]You're looking it up right now?
[231:15.32]No, no, I'm just, I'm writing that this, we're talking about spoilers.
[231:17.92]Okay, so, um, I didn't really care about this show at all.
[231:23.29]I just saw the thumbnail of the show, and it was just him, like, as Lucifer, right?
[231:29.49]He's, he looks like the devil.
[231:31.79]Um, I opened up episode one, and I scrolled through to find when he becomes that, like, Satan character.
[231:36.85]It doesn't happen.
[231:37.65]I, I went through every single episode, scrolling through, until he turned- When he does
[231:45.89]No, no, he doesn't.
[231:47.33]No, he doesn't.
[231:47.95]Yes, he does.
[231:48.69]No, he doesn't.
[231:49.27]He does it at the very end of the whole show.
[231:51.02]No?
[231:52.68]What do you mean, no?
[231:56.32]You're saying it's a spoiler that the show named Lucifer, the guy turns into the devil.
[232:03.11]Yeah, but he doesn't do it until one of the last episodes of the first season.
[232:09.17]I think at the end, he finally...
[232:14.09]no no I'm telling you I'm telling you no he doesn't in episode one he does he absolutely does it in episode one trailer it yes in the like episode one he starts by like tormenting some guy then he's like I'm the devil like 10 minutes in he does so my skip strategy was was had holes in it it's like a big reveal that other people realize he's that's like way further on
[232:42.41]But I don't think he like shows himself as the devil to like a... That's what I'm saying.
[232:48.95]It's really not what you're saying.
[232:50.31]It's really not.
[232:51.38]He doesn't, like, turn into, like, I'm Satan and I'm, like, I'm, like, horned and I'm, like... Okay, because we're in spoiler mode, the show gets so fucking weird where he finally reveals after, like, three seasons to the detective he's working with and he's, like, kind of in love with, like, hey, I'm actually Satan.
[233:06.31]And she's like, ah, I don't know how to cope with that.
[233:09.21]And they have this, like, weird on and off, like, I have been partners with Satan for, like, the last couple years of my life.
[233:18.42]and it's weird where she's like trying to come to terms with like him being literal Satan but we're talking about the okay let me make sure I got the right show we're talking about in the thumbnail he's like this like right like okay well Netflix changes the thumbnails a lot it's not always one thumbnail but I imagine yes that right there and he's like
[233:45.92]And he's Satan.
[233:47.46]He is Satan.
[233:48.52]He does solve crime as Satan.
[233:49.92]Wait, hold on a minute.
[233:51.32]This is... No, that's a series of unfortunate events.
[233:54.42]That's Count Olaf.
[233:55.68]Right?
[233:55.84]It's a different show?
[233:57.29]Hold on, wait.
[233:59.11]This is the same thumbnail.
[234:00.35]They used the same exact thumbnail for both shows.
[234:07.39]They use that a lot.
[234:08.67]But my point still stands.
[234:09.87]It doesn't reveal that he's Satan until the last episode.
[234:13.49]no your your point was no spoilers did you know the main guy in lucifer is lucifer no that's not what I'm saying I'm saying he doesn't like reveal that he's lucifer until like the last episode of the first season no my chat's reminding me that like he has like a devil face and he even he even calls it like devil face like a fucking preschooler and he doesn't do like devil face to someone
[234:41.23]for a bit but he's like very obviously Satan yeah but he doesn't he doesn't have the like he doesn't have that look until like the last episode of the first season you might be right about that I'm telling you I I I'm gonna I think I'm correct but it's not like they're hiding it
[235:02.40]No, you know it's obviously that guy is Lucifer.
[235:05.31]I'm just saying they don't do like that thumbnail face until one of the last episodes of the first season.
[235:10.57]Okay.
[235:11.17]And you skipped every episode to find the face.
[235:13.78]I just wanted to see a scene of him being like, oh, yes, it's me, Satan.
[235:18.00]I just wanted to find it.
[235:19.54]And I couldn't find it until the last episode.
[235:23.75]Okay.
[235:26.96]You didn't watch it?
[235:27.66]No, I didn't.
[235:28.10]I'm telling you, I scrubbed through every episode just to find the one time when he did it.
[235:34.79]Was it worth it?
[235:35.61]He does it every single episode.
[235:38.59]I've got to go back and do some scrubbing.
[235:40.11]He really does.
[235:41.01]He ends up trying to catch the person before his detective buddy does, and then he goes devil mode on him to be like, you shouldn't have done that.
[235:48.50]By the way, I'm Satan.
[235:49.64]And then he does some Satan stuff.
[235:52.60]in the first episode definitely it has to be in the first episode man he does it every episode yeah that's that's how I'm remembering it though I do think like I don't know season one probably has some like melodramatic reveal of like his real true Satan self
[236:23.89]I need to go.
[236:24.33]I'm going to have to do some homework tonight.
[236:25.87]Okay, eat this meat, buddy.
[236:33.13]Chomp on that.
[236:35.72]I want both these gems.
[236:36.98]You take one.
[236:37.48]I'm going to be mad.
[236:42.36]No, actually, you can take one of these.
[236:58.08]you mad hey take it we're about to fight the big boss oh god damn it spoiler alert the little mermaid is a mermaid how did I just get hit by that
[237:30.40]I just keep getting hit.
[237:31.66]It's annoying.
[237:38.21]Shit.
[237:39.55]These laser beams.
[237:40.47]Look at how good of an ability that is, by the way.
[237:44.49]Super accurate.
[237:45.33]Super damaging.
[237:48.08]Yeah.
[237:48.28]When are we going to get that ability?
[237:49.54]I was focusing, looking at you, and then they started shooting me a mile behind you.
[237:54.28]That's a great.
[237:55.38]What an amazing ability to have.
[238:16.53]sometimes for no reason.
[238:19.27]Incredible.
[238:32.60]What are your expressions of CG?
[238:34.40]I don't know.
[238:36.88]You're reading too much into it.
[238:58.22]He's beating his ass.
[239:01.90]We got a secret.
[239:03.60]I don't know what it was.
[239:22.59]That was a good one.
[239:23.13]That was clean.
[239:27.88]it was clean just like myself who showered today for this stream but not anymore because streaming has made me stinky
[239:41.64]We got kind of trapped on a tangent somewhere, but does your room get insanely hot when you stream?
[239:48.34]Insanely hot.
[239:49.96]Why does it do that?
[239:51.40]It's just like the computer rendering.
[239:53.46]It's only so awful.
[239:56.84]Yep.
[239:57.44]And you can't really have a big fan in the room because it kind of fucks up the mic and it's like... The chat, they don't know.
[240:08.21]uh it'll be like 80 degrees in my room and I I finished streaming and leave my room and the the rest of the the house feels like 60. it's crazy for that 120 degree weather

[241:54.70]It's got me all fucked up.
[241:57.26]I might die to this.

[243:36.83]We just, we were wrong.
[243:38.55]We just didn't pay attention to the game that we were supposed to be playing.
[243:43.58]There's apples down here, pal.
[243:46.04]There better be.
[243:49.48]Alright, buster.
[243:50.71]Let's go.
[244:17.13]I actually am gonna die.
[244:21.89]I need you, man.
[244:23.15]I'm dead.
[244:23.67]I couldn't fucking do anything.
[244:24.44]I was strapped.
[244:35.98]Is there even a mini boss?
[244:38.33]We fought the mini-boss.
[244:40.47]The herald.
[244:41.57]The cursed guy.
[244:42.39]We already did it, dude.
[244:43.57]I used to beat the whole boss by myself.
[244:47.50]And you got all the damage this time.
[244:50.02]What the fuck?
[244:53.68]I just got like... All the health was in the next room.
[244:58.86]Whoa!
[245:00.52]Wait, don't eat those.
[245:02.49]Wait, why are you back?
[245:03.47]Oh, because you have the revive.
[245:04.47]I have a revive.
[245:05.73]That is why I took it.
[245:07.75]What a fucked up day.
[245:12.77]Can I see you eat these, though?
[245:14.77]Yeah.
[245:16.49]Alright, we're good.
[245:17.73]Everybody relax.
[245:19.25]I was about to start being pissed off.
[245:21.15]Now I'm happy.
[245:22.03]He got the revive.
[245:22.85]It was good for his build.
[245:24.49]He was right.
[245:24.93]Alright, now no more talking.
[245:27.33]Silence only.
[245:27.99]I don't want you to think about that thumbnail that we laughed about earlier.
[245:36.25]silence actual silence for real I am gonna be completely quiet so I shouldn't say like no and don't like anything don't coach me in the corner no coaching let's beat it no commentary win
[246:08.33]Good job
[246:38.62]Oh, beware.
[246:39.32]He didn't even do it.
[246:42.51]I don't know how I'm getting hit by these.
[247:00.29]Oh, my goodness.
[247:03.46]Oh, my.
[247:03.90]I'm so bad.
[247:06.16]We're fine.
[247:20.63]I can't.
[247:21.31]He's going to suck.
[247:22.73]Oh, you're dead.
[247:23.23]Oh, no.
[247:23.67]I'm not dead.
[247:24.11]I'm not dead.
[247:24.56]I'm one HP.
[247:24.90]Oh, okay.
[247:27.32]I'm never getting hit again.
[247:40.71]My whole face is itching.
[247:42.09]Okay.
[247:59.92]Eh!
[248:26.75]Smash him!
[249:13.24]Nice job.
[249:14.88]Nice job.
[249:15.26]Wow.
[249:15.58]You did so good.
[249:16.56]One health.
[249:16.98]Holy shit.
[249:17.36]Nice job.
[249:18.16]Just focus up.
[249:18.96]You know what I'm saying?
[249:20.00]You know what I'm talking about?
[249:21.78]That was awesome.
[249:22.36]You know what I'm saying?
[249:23.76]One health.
[249:24.20]I can't believe it.
[249:28.24]Oh, gee williker.
[249:30.60]Nice job.
[249:31.70]Oh, geez.
[249:32.84]Oh, geez.
[249:33.46]Oh, you know what I'm saying?
[249:36.02]Something's going on with my eye.
[249:39.17]Oh, you eat that meat.
[249:40.37]Oh, you know what I'm saying?
[249:41.67]Oh, man, you know what I'm saying?
[249:44.39]That's not even the boss.
[249:46.49]Yeah, it was.
[249:47.73]We get the cup scene.
[249:50.49]That's you.
[249:50.91]Is that you?
[249:52.81]No, that's you.
[249:54.58]Oh, you curse.
[249:55.94]Insolence.
[250:01.51]Please have it be me.
[250:02.33]Please have it be me.
[250:08.72]That's not fair.
[250:11.86]That's not fair.
[250:16.62]That's not fair.
[250:23.33]Never died.
[250:24.09]There's only two of us.
[250:29.41]We did it.
[250:32.51]we sure did we're entering the question mark this is uh this is gonna be interesting okay the great forge anvil get it do you get it that is anvil do you get it do you get it I think you need to walk up
[251:09.83]You get it?
[251:10.23]We're on the same page?
[251:12.11]Yes.
[251:12.97]Anvil?
[251:14.85]Yes.
[251:17.15]What's the Jerma combo meal?
[251:18.29]Two McChickens, Bloomin' Onion, a Gatorade, a 10-piece McNugget, tuna salad, and pretzels.
[251:22.63]Sounds kind of good.
[251:25.39]I thought Bloomin' Onion has to be there because I went to Outback once and said it was good.
[251:29.79]But it's recent.
[251:33.18]It's topical.
[251:50.99]I'm feeling powerful.
[251:53.46]I actually do feel pretty strong right now.
[251:55.78]I don't.
[251:56.34]I feel like I'm using the bow and the bow is bad.
[252:06.17]I feel pain.
[252:07.15]I feel pain.
[252:11.33]Gem of Wisdom.
[252:13.09]What does that one do?
[252:14.71]Skill damage up.
[252:16.13]Let's do that.
[252:16.53]The agility is just move speed.
[252:26.99]Can't really cross that.
[252:28.01]I could roll.
[252:29.99]I could do a little bit of rolling.
[252:42.60]just like Elden Ring.
[252:51.32]Which Elden Ring?
[252:53.28]Which Elden Ring?
[252:54.10]Which Elden Ring castle or indoor environment has the best bathroom, you think?
[252:59.09]I thought you were going to say which Elden Ring castle are you?
[253:02.25]Which Elden Ring indoor facility bathroom would you like to use the most and order it by least to most favorite?
[253:11.79]I want to go to the top of that one spire, the giant tree spire that you climb down in the middle of, and shit all the way down.
[253:19.42]That's so stupid.
[253:34.45]At the Halleck tree?
[253:38.09]You can take this.
[253:41.89]I don't think it was a hallowed tree it was just a giant spire so which Elden Ring castle are you okay uh so oh it's the boss man it's what's the main guy he's not the boss but
[254:05.81]he's saying that things are he doesn't like us and that he's gonna win and he's doing the anime akuma turn his back and look at us with the eye flash uh he's saying that we're not useless but we are or something he's laughing that's a good one I like that one you really think you can stop me then deal with this draws a card from his Yu-Gi-Oh deck
[254:51.38]Oh, no, it's impossible.
[254:53.15]How could they have ever known to hit the crystals that were connecting the robots to the shields?
[254:59.19]Oh, it only takes two hits?
[255:02.33]Oh, how could they have ever figured that out in time?
[255:06.76]Two hits, really?
[255:07.64]Wow, my damage is not good.
[255:13.00]Evil villain tropes are so funny.
[255:15.88]Just like, and then they'll never get away from this.
[255:20.95]I loved in Diablo 3 when Asmodan would fucking monologue you every level.
[255:25.15]Actual Chrono Trigger joke, yeah.
[255:26.98]That is a Chrono Trigger joke.
[255:30.66]Have you played Chrono Trigger?
[255:34.37]No.
[255:35.81]No, I have not.
[255:37.43]Can I pay you to play it?
[255:43.15]I imagine there's a price.
[255:52.40]Damn it.
[255:56.52]How long is it?
[255:58.60]um it's pretty long it's a solid at least it's at least 20 30 hours at least I'd say probably somewhere around 40. you want to do everything
[256:30.84]When you beat Jade Cocoon, I'll play it.
[256:35.46]No, that's kind of unfair, though, because Chrono Trigger has had five re-releases on a bunch of different platforms.
[256:42.25]I either have to emulate this game or I have to buy it randomly from some random EA.
[256:47.27]Well, you just said you would pay me to play Chrono Trigger, and my price is you playing Jade Cocoon.
[256:52.64]Okay.
[256:53.52]I've named my price.
[256:56.66]That's just the way it's going to be.
[257:06.35]You're sitting there like Chrono Trigger is one of the greatest games of all time.
[257:09.63]He hasn't played Chrono Trigger.
[257:12.33]Someone else besides me has to have played Jade Cocoon.
[257:18.02]Every time I bring it up, everyone's like, what?
[257:19.54]What's that?
[257:20.66]I've heard it was really good.
[257:23.54]I've heard it was good.
[257:24.28]I'm just so sick of it.
[257:38.50]Oh, this is a... Ribbit?
[257:42.09]Ribbit?
[257:43.77]Frog.
[257:44.89]Oh, my God.
[257:46.81]Why can't we be friends with him?
[257:52.91]I know.
[257:53.41]Like, he only wasn't just such an insolent... Well, damn it.
[257:59.49]Maybe we could have been friends.
[258:11.31]How much damage are your hits doing?
[258:13.25]That one did 91.
[258:14.09]Okay.
[258:16.95]About 40 to 50 on average.
[258:24.45]My fully charged arrows is like 40.
[258:28.15]If I get a crit, it does about 100.
[258:31.07]And my non-charged ones are like 20.
[258:34.43]Oh, God.
[258:34.77]That was a lot.
[258:49.30]Go find the Nephilim.
[258:55.36]You're referencing things that I don't know about?
[258:57.12]That's not fair.
[258:57.68]That's not fair.
[258:58.70]You played Diablo 3.
[259:00.76]Oh.
[259:02.65]True.
[259:03.33]I didn't know that's what we were doing.
[259:07.17]Talk to Marvin.
[259:09.95]You wouldn't happen to know the way out of here, would you?
[259:15.37]No.
[259:17.69]Is that...
[259:19.88]okay kill kill okay I'm gonna get in your way you have a you have a couple of dollars if you want to buy something I do have a lot of money that's right uh well I want let's heal refresh all these are bad refresh are they bad that's all skills

[259:51.07]There it is.
[259:52.71]That skill's so good.
[259:55.95]Should I take it?
[259:57.05]I want it.
[259:57.61]If you're not going to take it, I want it.
[260:00.05]Can I drop it for you?
[260:02.03]Actually, I don't think you... Well, yeah, I think when you buy it, it drops on the ground.
[260:04.84]Yeah, there you go.
[260:07.54]If that improves your ability, then you should have it.
[260:20.66]I am improved.
[260:21.40]If you beat this boss first try, you have to make me a mod.
[260:24.04]If you lose, I get permabanned.
[260:26.32]Just permaband him now.
[260:26.98]I think that's easier.
[260:29.36]Yeah.
[260:30.12]You won't have to remember.
[260:32.50]That's too much for me to have to remember.

[264:21.22]This is actually kind of hard.
[264:44.25]I'm fucking the cheeseburger sub.
[264:46.15]You're still thinking about it.
[264:48.69]You're fighting this whole room and you're like, I think I got it.
[264:50.95]I think this is it.
[264:53.03]Okay.
[264:55.93]And then I'm going to marry the tuna sub and I'm going to kill the meatball sub.
[265:01.15]That's sad.
[265:03.39]Sad?
[265:04.64]Whoa, what?
[265:05.18]Hey, whoa.
[265:06.04]Okay.
[265:06.76]I thought they were crushing us.
[265:08.00]I can't move.
[265:09.30]Oh, there's apples in here.
[265:19.22]This may be the final boss.
[265:24.21]So I need you to focus up, not think about fucking a meatball sub right now.
[265:27.75]I... You weren't listening.
[265:31.51]Fucking your tuna sandwich.
[265:43.80]I do no damage.
[265:45.17]This thing's got a lot of health too.
[265:59.40]I'll try and take care of the adds because I can at least stun them and stuff.
[266:12.67]Ah, shit.
[266:13.25]Alright, I'm getting too weird about this.
[266:15.27]Get cocky.
[266:24.63]Oh, it's the worst alarm on the iPhone.
[266:28.93]I hate that!
[266:30.00]Oh my god, that just, that actually fucked me up big time.
[266:34.65]Wait, dude, don't you hate it in a TV show where they try and be authentic and use the real iPhone alarm noises?
[266:40.95]Yeah.
[266:41.51]And then the person takes way too long.
[266:44.13]They slowly roll over out of bed.
[266:46.29]It's like, dude, fucking what are you doing?
[266:48.98]Just press it.
[266:50.94]Everybody that has an alarm, everybody knows this.
[266:54.10]The first second you hear that sound, you freak out and jump up and turn it off as fast as you can.
[266:59.50]I'm going to die.
[267:05.15]Gonna be up to you here in a sec.
[267:07.43]Better not be.
[267:09.09]I can't hurt anything.
[267:13.06]Is there any food in any containers or anything?
[267:15.20]Any apples?
[267:16.18]Any apples in here?
[267:18.04]Good luck.
[267:19.46]I think we're getting roguelike.
[267:22.81]I think this whole run would have been better if I didn't use the bow.
[267:26.91]Like, if we both actually did hammer.
[267:29.07]Yeah, but we could be getting rogueliked.
[267:31.77]I don't think so.
[267:33.50]You don't think so?
[267:34.80]This is tricky.
[267:35.58]This is hard.
[267:45.69]My camera's being really weird.
[267:49.25]I mean...
[267:50.89]It's going to be very... I have faith in you.
[267:52.93]I truly do.
[267:53.87]Those adds are a killer though.
[267:56.25]I mean, this would be top gamer moment of the year if you could pull this off.
[268:23.04]If I win it's because of the shield dash.
[269:02.30]Nice.
[269:02.56]Gamer.
[269:03.12]Gamer.
[269:03.80]Gamer.
[269:04.08]Gamer.
[269:04.32]Gamer.
[269:06.46]Nice.
[269:10.20]We were supposed to get rogueliked there, but you didn't let it happen.
[269:12.78]Nice job.
[269:13.74]That was great.
[269:16.00]You know what?
[269:17.96]That claps for me.
[269:19.63]Honestly, one of the greats.
[269:29.69]I'm surprised that there's more.
[269:33.03]Uh, yeah, maybe, maybe not.
[269:35.03]I think that was the last one.
[269:37.10]Oh, yeah.
[269:37.60]Well, I'm glad you did that because we got to the end.
[269:44.14]Gaming, I think this is the final.
[269:46.50]There would be one more area in 1.0 is what I think is how it's going to be.
[269:57.86]Congratulations.
[269:58.76]Don't let your guard down as there's plenty of new content coming.
[270:03.84]Yeah, I hope you're the MVP.
[270:05.56]I think like if you still are and you probably still did more damage than me.
[270:09.73]Yep.
[270:11.01]Highly possible.
[270:12.17]Congrats, dude.
[270:13.07]You fucking earned it.
[270:14.77]Thanks.
[270:21.70]You got a few of those.
[270:29.00]I thought I would at least get rolled the most.
[270:37.15]Cool.
[270:38.43]Cool.
[270:39.29]This is good.
[270:41.07]I heavily enjoyed this game.
[270:42.58]That was really fun.
[270:44.68]Yeah, I want to see what was up with the Raptor guy.
[270:48.86]It's very, very fun.
[270:54.51]I wonder when 1.0 comes out.
[270:56.31]Did get the final weapon.
[271:02.98]this guy come come over up to the dino guy come up to the dino come up to the dinosaur we have to identify items we have to talk to dad we have things to identify that first one seems great yep okay let's talk to the dino
[271:30.16]This old thing has seen better days, hasn't it?
[271:32.50]He's going to fix it.
[271:33.20]Oh, he's going to fix it.
[271:33.96]Look at this.
[271:34.48]Look at this.
[271:34.92]Look at this.
[271:35.48]Look at this.
[271:36.10]Look at him fixing it.
[271:37.86]Look at it.
[271:38.50]Look at that.
[271:39.06]If you shit your pants during a five-minute sprays, you have to tell us.
[271:44.03]Okay.
[271:45.71]I wouldn't hide it.
[271:46.63]No hiding it either.
[271:47.65]We want to know.
[271:53.39]Skill convergence and creation device.
[271:58.56]It lets you break down skill tablets into their most basic parts.
[272:01.44]Like, miniscule.
[272:02.60]I mean, so small you can't even see them, dude.
[272:06.47]Then it demographizes them into new skills.
[272:10.09]So you can wait.
[272:10.63]Can you make?
[272:11.05]This is a new mechanic.
[272:17.21]What do we got?
[272:20.45]Anyway, we can convert the skill tablets you find into new skills.
[272:24.02]Pretty great, huh?
[272:25.91]you find any more be sure to bring them back to me what's the skill tablet acquire skill I guess we could never find them before because we never did it we didn't have him yet oh okay what's the what's the last weapon razor wind there's also another weapon
[272:51.91]This is such a... This is a Ster weapon.
[272:53.99]This is such a Ster weapon.
[272:56.44]Spectral throw is one of my favorite skills.
[272:58.76]You're not wrong.
[273:03.19]Actually, it's good, but it takes a long time to load up a perfect...
[273:09.16]Yeah, but it still has like a quick attack, just like the sword does.
[273:12.02]Sword doesn't have a charge thing, right?
[273:14.72]No, it doesn't.
[273:15.72]The thing with the sword is it has the dash move.
[273:18.14]It has the dash attack.
[273:18.98]So you can kind of just get in and get out.
[273:23.71]Whenever you hit an enemy with your charge attack, your chain attacks become empowered and deal bonus damage.
[273:29.55]I don't know what chain attack is.
[273:30.71]Maybe the lightning chains?
[273:32.67]Yeah, okay.
[273:40.47]I wonder what the last, uh, there's one more weapon that's not here yet.
[273:45.92]Truly, who knows?
[273:48.62]Alright.
[273:49.14]Well, are you ready to play Five Nights at Freddy's?
[273:52.36]Which one should he play?
[273:53.40]Should he play one or two?
[273:54.36]I got them both.
[273:59.48]Ster, do you remember when you said, uh, uh, what was it about how you were just going to be the entertainment on the stream?
[274:08.15]uh yeah well hey everybody we're gonna raid Ster I'm gonna stay in the call and we're gonna watch him play so you what you said was accurate yeah so we figured that would be the best way to do it because otherwise it's hard with like stream delays for him to even actually watch yeah so I'm just gonna stay in the call I'm gonna raid him and we're gonna watch Five Nights at Freddy's I'm gonna be in the call
[274:35.53]People saying play both.
[274:36.79]Let's get a poll.
[274:37.63]Poll in your chat.
[274:38.53]Poll in my chat.
[274:40.83]Could he do one or two?
[274:42.23]Because I'm going to... Let's be realistic.
[274:44.11]MrBeRealistic2.
[274:45.55]You're probably going to play this for like 30 minutes and uninstall both of them.
[274:51.04]You said beating the game was like two hours.
[274:54.42]Give or take.
[274:57.43]Then if two is the better one, maybe we should just do two.
[275:00.15]Let's see.
[275:00.43]Because I feel like if it took that long to like legitimately beat one and move on to two, I would not want to play two at that point.
[275:07.13]One is way more beginner friendly.
[275:10.53]I'm not a beginner.
[275:11.67]Yeah, but there's a bunch of weird shit.
[275:13.31]The balloon boy and you got to put a mask on when they come into the room and stuff.
[275:18.87]I think, I don't know.
[275:20.43]We'll see.
[275:22.23]What does your chat say?
[275:24.60]I didn't make a poll.
[275:26.71]and there's like one guy that said please play two okay so do you want to go by the one guy in your chat or do you want to go by what
[275:34.23]What's going on over here?
[275:35.77]Like, you'll be here to tell me, like, what I need to do with the mask.
[275:38.75]You should definitely just... Okay, do start with one, and then... Just play, like, a quick one, and then jump into two?
[275:45.57]Yeah, like, get familiar with one, and then you'll understand two.
[275:49.19]And then we can just jump right into two after, like, 15 minutes.
[275:52.48]Let's get it, champ.
[275:53.74]Okay.
[275:55.34]So, hold on.
[275:55.86]Let me make sure this is going well.

[276:31.49]This game opened in, like, a black-bordered full-screen window.
[276:37.79]There is no options menu, and it's super loud.
[276:41.25]It is a pretty loud game.
[276:46.32]Alright.
[276:49.56]Yeah, either tomorrow or Monday, I'll update the sus later.
[276:54.50]But we don't have time.

[277:01.89]While we raid Ster.
[277:05.14]What are you doing?
[277:05.92]I'm raiding you right now and I'm just doing the credits.
[277:09.56]Oh my god.
[277:11.18]I can't wait for this.
[277:21.38]I don't know why you're so excited.
[277:24.24]I really don't.
[277:25.12]Because I know that you're probably going to hate this.
[277:27.98]And I just want to see how you do this.
[277:33.65]We're going to get a Diablo rant about Five Nights at Freddy's and the whole universe.

[278:00.04]By the way, we're going to be raiding.
[278:01.68]You're not going to be able to see the end of these credits.
[278:03.60]I apologize, but I have to tell you this really quickly.
[278:06.84]The plan is to play Devil May Cry.
[278:09.10]I don't know which one to start with.
[278:12.32]That's another one that people scream at me and tell me which one.
[278:16.76]But we're going to play Devil May Cry on Monday.
[278:21.14]I don't know which one, but one of them.
