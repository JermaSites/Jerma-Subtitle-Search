[00:29.02]What's up?
[00:35.48]How's it going?
[00:36.34]Oh, shit.
[00:37.82]No, we're good.
[00:40.19]How's everybody doing?
[00:40.73]Good?
[00:41.77]How you been?
[00:43.59]It's been a little while.
[00:57.92]We missed you.
[01:02.21]Thank you.
[01:03.61]Hey.
[01:05.11]It goes both ways.
[01:05.95]I want to get back in the chair too.
[01:08.25]How you doing?
[01:10.05]Everyone doing good?
[01:10.83]What's been going on?
[01:13.75]Anything new?
[01:15.60]Anything I should know?
[01:16.48]I hope you're doing good.
[01:19.42]It's been a few weeks.
[01:21.44]Has it been three weeks or two and a half?
[01:23.64]I don't know.
[01:27.38]Show us your face.
[01:33.55]Give me a second.
[01:34.47]It's been like a couple weeks.
[01:36.13]Hold on.
[01:36.49]Yeah, we're going to play Shadows of Doubt.
[01:46.82]I have something very important to talk about too.
[01:50.14]I'm a little saddened to say this, but I don't think I'm going to be able to complete Breath of the Wild before Tears of the Kingdom comes out.
[02:04.19]Sorry to all you Breath of the Wild Andes.
[02:07.13]I don't think that's going to happen.
[02:08.57]The game comes out literally tomorrow.
[02:11.13]I don't think... I promised?
[02:13.35]Wait, I promised?
[02:14.74]Did I?
[02:16.72]Did I actually promise to do this?
[02:19.43]Did I?
[02:20.27]Oh, fuck.
[02:25.06]I did not promise I was going to beat this game, did I?
[02:29.88]How deep of a promise was this?
[02:33.12]I didn't say I was going to eat any articles of clothing, right?
[02:38.90]I didn't say I was going to eat any articles of clothing?
[02:41.32]Or did I?
[02:46.90]You promised.
[02:51.41]Uh-oh.
[02:55.25]Does anybody have a clip?
[03:00.44]You owe me 10 bucks.
[03:03.36]Yeah, I'm probably just going to have to play Breath of the Wild while everybody else is playing.
[03:08.46]It's going to be so stupid.
[03:09.52]You know how many people are going to come to the stream in the next few days and be like, dude, what are you doing?
[03:16.20]What's wrong with you?
[03:21.79]We will forgive you if you eat an article of clothing.
[03:28.12]Nah, I think I'm alright.
[03:33.24]Does anybody have a quote for me?
[03:37.06]I'm at the podium right now.
[03:39.04]Yeah, hold on a minute.
[03:39.96]Hold on.
[03:40.24]All the reporters are taking pictures.
[03:43.14]Anybody have a quote for me saying I was going to do that?
[03:51.74]I don't think anybody's got a quote.
[04:03.81]You did say it.
[04:04.55]Someone will find it eventually, but anyways.
[04:08.01]What if we just watch the Breath of the Wild story recap trailer and I hold a controller in my hand while we watch it and I move like I'm dodging and stuff.
[04:19.66]Is that alright?
[04:20.50]Is that alright?
[04:26.44]It's not the same.
[04:27.40]No.
[04:31.47]How long do I have till it's out?
[04:35.39]Is it out Friday?
[04:36.09]Saturday?
[04:36.47]Sunday?
[04:36.73]When is it out?
[04:38.87]There's no way I'm going to beat this game.
[04:40.17]There's no way I'm going to beat it.
[04:44.25]No.
[04:44.49]Don't worry.
[04:46.29]I'm not concerned about it.
[04:48.88]Guys, the last... I think I've played maybe three AAA games at launch.
[04:57.83]All the rest I play at least six months later.
[05:01.41]And I don't know.
[05:02.11]Maybe do I play Tears of the Kingdom?
[05:04.27]Maybe?
[05:04.59]I don't know.
[05:05.96]I have to beat Breath of the Wild first.
[05:12.06]I'm ranting right now.
[05:13.56]Trying to find a way out of this.
[05:16.34]But we will finish it.
[05:22.51]How do I find a way out of this?
[05:26.48]Alright.
[05:26.78]Anyways, how you doing?
[05:27.66]Hope you're doing good.
[05:28.26]I did want to play Shadows of Doubt because Etalyx brought it up.
[05:33.80]He said it was great.
[05:34.52]He said it's right up your alley.
[05:35.78]I was like, really?
[05:36.52]He's like, yeah.
[05:37.26]I said, okay.
[05:45.57]If you do play Tears of the Kingdom... Okay.
[05:48.19]Okay.
[05:49.88]I'm not going to be around.
[05:50.62]I'm going to savor the game for myself.
[05:53.24]That's fine.
[05:54.75]That's completely understandable.
[05:55.77]Makes complete sense to me.
[06:00.77]Okay, so... Let me... First of all, let me just prove that I'm alive.
[06:05.46]Right?
[06:05.62]Let me just get this over with.
[06:08.96]Hi.
[06:09.82]Yes.
[06:10.42]I'm alive.
[06:12.00]I exist.
[06:15.48]Also, I've been seeing a lot of people talk...
[06:19.05]It's weird because, see, a lot of people talk about Pegasus King 2.
[06:22.99]And they're acting like I didn't get an advanced copy of that game.
[06:27.05]Honestly.
[06:27.37]Like, really?
[06:30.93]Really?
[06:31.21]You don't think that I already have a copy of that game?
[06:38.64]You don't think I've already played it?
[06:41.50]Kind of annoying.
[06:47.66]I'm always one step ahead of you!
[06:56.02]Two steps forward, you're one step back.
[06:57.68]Two steps forward, you're one step back.
[07:05.69]Nice beard.
[07:06.39]Oh, yeah.
[07:11.69]Why do you have film grain?
[07:15.05]Is there?
[07:21.53]Oh, my God, this is actually huge.
[07:23.53]Hey, hey, I'm back, everybody.
[07:28.48]How's everybody doing?
[07:30.40]Oh, yeah, well, you know, I have, you know, I'll be in a razor, you know, I haven't shaved.
[07:34.96]And I haven't gone to, I haven't had a haircut either.
[07:37.16]I'm keeping it.
[07:37.68]I don't give a shit.
[07:39.63]I don't care.
[07:40.65]I'm just going to grow.
[07:41.21]I'm going to grow until it's like this long.
[07:43.09]Fuck it.
[07:48.34]What do you think?
[07:50.38]Should I let it go?
[07:51.23]Should I just let it go, like, all the way?
[07:53.53]I'm gonna start playing with fire on stream.
[08:03.66]Alright, let's go.
[08:06.12]You've waited long enough.
[08:08.38]You've waited over two and a half weeks.
[08:11.18]I'm here now.
[08:12.16]How's everybody doing?
[08:15.74]This game apparently is, you solve, it's randomly generated cases.
[08:21.41]Seems pretty cool.
[08:21.87]I'm going to have to pay a lot of attention, though.
[08:28.65]Alright.
[08:30.34]Now, Etalyx told me, do the tutorial and pay attention.
[08:34.50]He said, don't do this, do not play this game if you're not ready to put real brain power into this.
[08:40.54]He's like, you have to pay attention.
[08:42.34]You have to know where the tools are.
[08:44.42]You have to know what to say.
[08:45.30]And then I asked him to repeat that three more times before I understood.
[08:50.91]I wasn't really paying attention to what he was saying.
[08:53.49]So, I'm ready.
[08:55.41]I know exactly what I'm getting into.
[08:57.15]I'm going to pay attention.
[08:58.85]I promise I'm going to pay attention.
[09:01.89]Here we go.
[09:03.57]I'm ready.
[09:04.87]Can you guys even hear the game?
[09:07.61]Oh, shit.
[09:08.01]Sorry.
[09:11.31]Do you guys mind if I turn the fan on?
[09:14.03]Why am I asking you?
[09:17.21]Alright.
[09:17.95]Should I select the city?
[09:24.91]Generate city or select city?
[09:27.53]For tutorial purposes.
[09:32.38]What is this?
[09:34.00]Okay.
[09:39.44]North...
[09:43.65]Part Sapporo.
[09:46.49]Mercy.
[09:46.81]Okay, how about this one?
[09:47.55]This one looks good.
[09:52.43]Is this like... Do you guys have my... Like, is this a seed or something?
[09:55.77]You guys can play along?
[09:56.71]Cool.
[09:56.85]This is going to crash my computer.
[10:04.53]What's my player's name?
[10:05.83]Okay.
[10:10.93]What do I look like?
[10:15.85]I don't know.
[10:18.69]What should I put the... Alright, normal probably, right?
[10:20.89]You look disgruntled.
[10:33.18]Should I just have my brow down the whole time?
[10:36.22]Just like... I look disgruntled.
[10:45.42]I think this, wait.
[10:56.53]Gadget Lysenko.
[10:59.11]I think that's perfect.
[11:05.85]We're good?
[11:10.26]Yo, that's my name.
[11:11.42]What the fuck?
[11:14.53]Alright, stop talking to me.
[11:15.79]I need to pay attention.
[11:16.71]I'm serious.
[11:18.49]I need to... I have to pay attention.
[11:19.65]I need to pay attention.
[11:20.38]I need to pay attention.
[11:21.06]I need to pay attention.
[11:23.58]Caveman detective.
[11:32.42]Don't put ideas in my head.
[11:38.21]Stop distracting me.
[11:39.15]You're doing it.
[11:43.00]I would need a pipe.
[11:45.22]A caveman outfit.
[11:52.07]Pay attention.
[11:52.93]Pay attention to what?
[11:53.73]It's just generating the seed.
[12:01.14]You are literally Willem Dafoe in the lighthouse.
[12:23.99]Damn, I feel like I'm installing Windows right now.
[12:31.35]This is going to be crazy.
[12:35.07]Simulating past events?
[12:44.28]Wait!
[12:45.04]Look out for graffiti that may give clues about illegal businesses.
[12:50.51]I should have been reading all of this.
[12:53.67]I know that most of you that have played this before probably just, like, this is basic, like, press tab to look at your inventory or whatever, but I probably need to know this.
[13:00.88]Alright, everybody be quiet.
[13:07.12]In Shadows of Doubt, the tutorial will guide you through how to use mechanics, though connecting the dots throughout the case is on your shoulders, detective.
[13:16.37]Help can be accessed at any time through your detective handbook or the main menu with F1.
[13:20.67]Turn it on.
[13:27.74]It is the late 20th century.
[13:35.23]Hyper-industrialization has swept the planet.
[13:43.34]The old urban empire has crumbled, giving way to the United Atlantic States and the first elected megacorporation president in history, Starch Cola.
[13:53.42]Do you have a wicked slow computer?
[13:57.68]No, I don't.
[14:00.22]As sea levels rise, cities have become polluted islands.
[14:09.61]Workers dream of escaping to the fields.
[14:12.29]An exclusive retirement district you will ever see.
[14:14.51]Okay.
[14:22.11]Process it.
[14:22.55]Don't just read it.
[14:23.71]Fuck, I'm doing it again.
[14:39.48]Some say justice now only exists in the shadows.
[14:42.99]I'm trying to pay attention.
[14:44.37]Stop distracting me over here.
[14:46.09]Shadows of doubt.
[14:51.29]Okay.
[14:57.48]The dead of night.
[15:01.96]52 a.m.
[15:02.81]Tuesday, January 3rd.
[15:03.81]Your apartment.
[15:19.00]That's probably good, right?
[15:22.41]That's much better.
[15:27.47]Turn it up.
[15:32.81]So cold.
[15:33.37]Turn on the bedside light.
[15:42.23]Okay, what?
[15:44.41]Why would I read this right now?
[15:46.19]I'm not ready for this.
[15:48.51]I'm not ready for this info.
[15:51.09]It's too loud.
[15:51.61]Hold on.
[15:51.91]It's way too loud.
[15:52.59]Okay.
[16:01.61]I just can't get used to sleeping without... What?
[16:04.71]He's just lying here.
[16:10.18]Get up.
[16:10.68]Oh.
[16:12.86]Turn on the light switch in the kitchen.
[16:15.91]Oh, there's like a little... Is this a scary game?
[16:31.50]It's locked.
[16:32.62]Jump.
[16:34.22]What's in there?
[16:36.40]What is this?
[16:37.36]Oh, this is a lot of reading in this game.

[16:43.63]Drawn up between the landlord, Emer Jackson, and me.

[19:00.71]I've just signed it.
[19:01.77]Okay, I guess.
[19:02.82]Did I?
[19:03.06]Oh.
[19:03.68]Alright, let's go.
[19:09.46]Why do I need to know all this?
[19:19.60]What's that?
[19:20.84]What's this?
[19:21.46]Okay, it's January.
[19:23.19]Oh, I can change the date by moving it.
[19:29.11]Oh, city directory.
[19:29.89]Okay, that's a lot of people.
[19:41.48]Let me just do what it's telling... Just stop overwhelming myself and just turn the light on.
[19:47.56]That's it.
[19:48.28]Don't... Why am I doing... Why am I making this more complicated?
[19:51.60]When within range, possible interactions will be displayed at the bottom.
[19:56.92]Oh.
[20:02.94]Hello!
[20:10.58]Who's this?
[20:11.73]Ow!
[20:28.85]Why did somebody call me and hang up?
[20:33.84]What was that?
[20:34.34]Alright.
[20:38.84]Search for clues.
[20:44.18]Former Police Officers Welfare Association.
[20:46.07]We're here for you.
[20:47.09]Free basic housing for those in need.
[20:48.75]For more information, contact... Please note, we can no longer help with money.
[20:55.57]Wait.
[20:56.97]Call?
[20:57.41]Should I call this person?
[21:03.71]There's a lot of... I don't have this person's phone number.
[21:06.77]I don't know their telephone number.
[21:15.36]Call them.
[21:16.22]The directory.
[21:16.78]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[21:19.56]I don't know why you'd sprint across your house like that.
[21:22.58]Okay.
[21:24.04]Wait.
[21:34.20]Shut up for a second.
[21:36.50]What?
[21:36.76]What's?
[21:37.22]Hold on.
[21:37.76]What's the person's name?

[21:43.80]Alright.
[22:08.51]Wait, this is their apartment?
[22:10.07]A lot of routes.
[22:15.92]Should we just go?
[22:17.00]Hang out?
[22:21.38]I just planned a route.
[22:22.62]Wait, I can pin this.
[22:23.60]Whoa, okay.
[22:26.34]So, alright.
[22:27.54]There's a note under the front door.
[22:28.76]That's not a front door.
[22:32.88]Where's my front door?
[22:37.39]This is also not my front door.
[22:38.99]This is my front door.
[22:39.93]What is this?
[22:44.89]When you inspect an item, it brings up its evidence window.
[22:47.55]This can be pinned to your caseboard for future reference using the pin at the top.
[22:51.76]Okay.
[22:53.04]So I can pin info.
[22:56.64]Got it.
[23:03.41]Thank God I got a beard for today's stream.
[23:07.90]Pinned items are displayed as icons that you can move around on the board by dragging their pin.
[23:11.86]You can position these items as you wish.
[23:13.38]Select them to bring up their evidence.
[23:15.34]You can make connections.
[23:19.84]Facts or connections are displayed as string.
[23:22.64]You can mouse over these to see more info.
[23:24.30]You can use F to pause at any time to examine the caseboard.
[23:29.97]Find Killian DeWitt.
[23:35.85]Pin Killian DeWitt to your caseboard.
[23:42.61]Pin the note to your caseboard.
[23:51.20]Oh shit, I fucked it all up.
[23:53.30]What happened?
[23:55.04]Close the ca- wait, what is this?
[24:00.38]This is the caseboard, right?
[24:06.61]Isn't it pinned right now?
[24:07.85]These are all pinned.
[24:10.07]Alright, move this out of the way.
[24:10.85]This is not... I need to find this person.
[24:13.89]Let me go look them up in the directory.
[24:19.56]Never heard of them.
[24:20.84]If this is a job, it's a lousy way to do business.
[24:27.82]Yep, okay.
[24:28.50]Look them up in the directory.
[24:37.02]Okay.
[24:37.18]Pin to your caseboard.
[24:44.50]Whatever it is, I better go prepared.
[24:48.14]Find old detective equipment.
[24:53.66]Oh, wait.
[24:54.26]Okay, that's map.
[24:55.92]You also have access to city district map that you can toggle and uplift.
[24:58.89]Whatever.
[24:59.37]I missed it.
[25:01.95]What's the caseboard again?
[25:02.85]F?
[25:04.01]Alright.
[25:04.37]I'm starting to understand.
[25:04.99]I'm getting it.
[25:05.37]I'm getting it.
[25:13.15]This is where I need to go.
[25:13.79]Find a route.
[25:16.75]We're heading that way.
[25:19.63]Screwdriver.
[25:20.31]I'll take it.
[25:20.74]Texas inventory.
[25:22.66]Okay.
[25:25.86]Should I take snacks?
[25:29.68]Is this still good?
[25:34.39]Are they still good?
[25:35.33]I don't know.
[25:36.25]Why did it let me throw that?
[25:43.74]Dish detergent?
[25:45.68]Okay, I could use that.
[25:46.96]Give me some tissues.
[25:50.84]What's in the fridge?
[25:52.10]There's milk.
[25:53.68]And there's a block of chicken.
[25:56.98]What about the freezer?
[25:59.73]That's all I need is a detective, apparently.
[26:01.95]Find old detective equipment.
[26:07.65]Synthetic milk?
[26:08.69]Synth milk?
[26:10.53]Oh, a wrench?
[26:13.38]Inventory's full.
[26:15.60]What?
[26:16.56]How do I get to my inventory?
[26:17.40]I?
[26:17.52]How do I open inventory again?
[26:19.52]X. Okay.
[26:28.51]Okay, well I don't need this, so I'll get rid of this.
[26:34.99]I... I gotta turn that down.
[26:38.33]It's awful.
[26:40.40]Alright, I'm taking the screwdriver, the milk, and the chicken.
[26:47.60]Do I need anything else?
[26:53.46]The key to my old police stuff was lost in the last move.
[26:57.29]I could pick the lock.
[26:58.15]There's got to be something I could use around here.
[26:59.57]Look for hairpins or paperclips.
[27:09.55]What about the... I can use the wrench?
[27:12.81]I don't think I can.
[27:14.07]It's money.
[27:21.51]Money can be used to buy items in the world.
[27:23.44]Acquire genetic upgrades for your character.
[27:26.00]Pay for information.
[27:26.90]Decorate your apartment.
[27:27.86]Really?
[27:28.10]This is... Oh, wait a minute.
[27:29.42]What's this?
[27:31.50]Final notice.
[27:32.24]Open immediately.
[27:39.30]How do I open it?
[27:42.16]Final notice, open immediately.
[27:43.74]So open it.
[27:44.14]This is a letter from me?
[27:53.03]Okay, I need to find, hold on, let me do the tutorial.
[28:11.48]What?
[28:12.14]Oh, I got Luigi'd.
[28:13.02]That took too long.
[28:14.46]Okay, pick the lock.
[28:33.61]I need two of these?
[28:34.73]Why would I need two?
[28:35.61]Oh, wait. 7%.
[28:44.21]Did I open it?
[28:45.75]What happened?
[28:47.29]What did I just do?
[28:49.77]I need two?
[28:50.69]Oh, okay.
[28:53.68]What's that?
[28:53.98]Okay.
[28:57.94]Okay.
[29:16.81]Locked?
[29:19.41]Dude, this is my door.
[29:20.73]How am I locked in my own house?
[29:22.89]Hey.
[29:29.46]Gadget.
[29:30.68]I set the password back to 1234.
[29:31.86]Take care of yourself.
[29:36.30]This is my house.
[29:38.96]Password is 1234.
[29:47.01]Toothpaste.
[29:47.43]Toothbrush.
[29:53.79]God damn it.
[29:54.47]I need more room.
[30:01.58]Let me fix this right now.
[30:07.18]That's better.
[30:13.78]Oh, a paperclip.
[30:17.54]Each lock has its own strength.
[30:18.80]This game is actually pretty cool.
[30:21.18]I'm very interested.
[30:23.75]When you start the process by interacting with the door handle or lock, the indicated bars will tell you how many picks you need to complete the lockpick.
[30:30.71]Okay, so I would need three.
[30:32.27]You can also use lockpicks to sabotage security systems.
[30:39.93]Okay.
[30:42.63]This is a very weird toilet.
[30:52.75]I should probably drop these, right?
[31:02.15]I'm just checking, just making sure I don't miss anything.
[31:09.06]Okay, let's go.
[31:11.96]Don't jump.
[31:16.72]Okay, got it.
[31:17.36]Ooh.
[31:19.12]Ooh.
[31:24.18]Okay, yep, X. The top group, wait, I gotta pay attention.
[31:27.36]Let me just take a sip.
[31:32.90]The top group of items do not take up inventory space.
[31:36.22]These are for your vital tools of the trade.
[31:39.72]The lower section features slots that can store other world items.
[31:44.21]So, okay, that's, I got it.
[31:45.67]You can drop or scan picked up items for fingerprints.
[31:49.59]Ooh, that's cool.
[31:52.11]Assign hotkeys.
[31:53.99]Press the hotkey by hovering and pressing.
[31:57.31]You guys just... Just pay attention to this so I can ask you later.
[32:00.54]Okay.
[32:07.24]I got 30 lockpicks?
[32:13.69]That was what was in that box?
[32:17.49]Okay.
[32:18.31]I got the key to my house.
[32:19.67]The password was...
[32:21.90]Pinned.
[32:22.72]Select the pin.
[32:23.93]Yep.
[32:26.47]And then I already got it planned.
[32:30.71]Unlock the door to your apartment by interacting with the door.
[32:32.87]That's the closet.
[32:45.30]Hello, everybody!
[32:46.98]It's me, the detective!
[32:50.49]Here to hopefully solve another couple of cases!
[32:54.33]Hey!
[32:55.41]You be on your best behavior!
[33:00.85]Now I wasn't locked in my room for 45 minutes.
[33:08.83]Alright, I have to go... I can talk to... Unknown citizen, new information.
[33:20.77]Evening, what's your name?
[33:22.05]Have you seen or heard anything unusual?
[33:23.11]Do you know this person?
[33:24.83]Could you provide your fingerprints for an invest- Do you know this person?
[33:30.81]I can't help you.
[33:34.27]Evening, what's your name?
[33:36.86]I'm Jarek McLean.
[33:38.68]What's it up to you?
[33:41.66]You got any spare change?
[33:45.20]That guy just gave me money.
[33:47.46]Thank you.
[33:51.94]That guy gave me two bucks.
[33:55.76]Okay.
[34:00.83]What's that person?
[34:06.23]How do I put this person on the board?
[34:08.15]Oh, there it is.
[34:15.23]Okay.
[34:18.25]How do I write a note that was very nice to me?
[34:30.34]Additional notes.
[34:31.32]It was incredibly nice and gave me $2.
[34:32.72]I don't think we need to remember this person, but whatever.
[34:49.78]Is sprinting bad?
[34:50.54]This is locked.
[34:59.38]Somebody's coming to answer the door.
[35:01.68]Banker, bar, and grill?
[35:03.36]Is this a restaurant?
[35:15.69]Evening.
[35:16.83]How much for a tour of this place?
[35:19.65]Sure, I can issue a temporary guest pass, but it'll cost you.
[35:21.83]Okay.
[35:24.27]How much?
[35:27.25]How much money do I have?
[35:33.15]Do you know this person?
[35:35.43]I saw them today at Thompson House Ground Floor Lobby around 2.15 a.m.
[35:40.70]Isn't that how time it is right now?
[35:45.68]What's your name?
[35:47.04]I'm CEO Yun Yi.
[35:49.16]What's it to you?
[35:55.59]What?
[35:57.07]Uh...
[36:07.86]Let's go!
[36:12.78]Can I get in trouble?
[36:16.26]What is this place?
[36:17.02]Is it a hospital?
[36:24.29]Am I allowed to be in here?
[36:25.95]I guess it's just a hospital, right?
[36:31.89]Leave with the fire extinguisher.
[36:34.54]Yeah, OFFICIAL POLICE BUSINESS!
[36:37.68]I need to take this with me!
[36:45.24]Uh, can I- How do I- What do I do with this, though?
[36:48.34]Depending on your activity, different kinds of status may affect your character.
[36:50.58]Oh, wait.
[36:52.14]Something's wrong.
[36:53.06]What does that mean?
[36:54.94]What's that mean?
[36:59.10]Wet.
[37:01.88]Oh.
[37:02.34]I thought that meant I was in trouble.
[37:09.34]Why are you running?
[37:13.01]I'm just like a fucking weirdo.
[37:15.73]Alright, let me... Go to 901 Royal Heights.
[37:24.87]Okay.
[37:32.60]They ain't coming back this time?
[37:45.03]Wait, is this a trash can or is that an ATM?
[37:49.86]You know I'm gonna have to take the plunger, right?
[37:53.20]What?
[38:04.41]Fists?
[38:19.73]I don't think we're ever gonna get any- we're not gonna get anything done.
[38:22.25]I just want to make that really clear.
[38:23.35]I'm sorry, everybody.
[38:24.55]I don't think we're gonna solve one case.
[38:29.30]What- I gotta- how do I put these down?
[38:31.62]Okay.
[38:32.12]I have to pay- this is the tutorial.
[38:33.38]I can't fuck around.
[38:35.14]What's that?
[38:35.46]It's a battery.
[38:39.02]God, just draw- I- I need to just go- just go up the- just go up the stairs, please, man.
[38:50.10]Okay.
[38:50.28]Keep going.
[38:53.93]Twelve.
[38:54.17]Oh.
[39:22.37]What's this?
[39:23.95]Junk.
[39:27.01]Footprint.
[39:28.51]These are footprints.
[39:29.57]Right here.
[39:30.79]How do I scan it?
[39:46.74]This is a different foot.
[39:50.27]size eight and a size six what I've deduced is that they have two different size feet I don't know I'm not sure we're dealing with here okay
[40:19.91]Brr.
[40:21.63]Cough.
[40:22.07]What's up?
[40:27.64]Evening.
[40:27.84]What's your name?
[40:28.92]As if I'd tell you.
[40:30.66]Okay.
[40:32.20]Um.
[40:33.20]I'll give you money for your name.
[40:35.08]Do you know this person?
[40:37.70]It's not enough info for me to help you.
[40:40.82]I think it's your neighbor.
[40:42.68]Okay.
[40:43.14]Well, goodbye.
[40:54.84]Oh my... Never mind.
[41:08.39]I didn't know that could happen.
[41:09.61]Am I alive?
[41:13.33]Where even am I?
[41:14.15]I have a broken leg?
[41:21.33]I didn't know you could actually do that.
[41:30.50]right now I did not know I thought there was an invisible barrier that didn't let me walk through it not we're only on the sixth floor where's the elevator we need to go floor number nine let's go
[42:03.93]I swear I didn't do that on purpose.
[42:18.30]It's so funny even though it hurts.
[42:24.04]To know if a door is locked or not, you must first have to try and open it.
[42:28.29]Locked doors can be unlocked by focusing on the door handle.
[42:31.33]If you have the correct key for the door, you'll see an interaction open.
[42:34.25]Okay.
[42:35.41]So this is locked.
[42:37.81]Door is locked.
[42:38.39]Okay.
[42:50.53]When breaking into a room, it's a good idea to check for cameras.
[42:53.41]If you're worried about them, you can turn them off by using the security breaker box connected to the camera.
[42:57.43]Is this person... Hold on.
[42:59.01]You don't say...
[43:17.53]We need to listen.
[43:20.66]Hold on.
[43:22.88]Are they just watching Nick at night?
[43:54.55]There's nobody in here.
[43:55.25]Alright, where's the camera?
[43:59.01]Oh my god, what did I just do?
[44:00.05]I thought that... How do I restart the game?
[44:03.83]How do I restart the game?
[44:05.83]I don't want to sabotage this.
[44:09.15]That's an alarm.
[44:09.99]What is that?
[44:11.03]I honestly... Where's the breaker?
[44:20.87]This is like the alarm.
[44:25.48]I owe a hundred bucks to who?
[44:27.29]To who?
[44:57.59]Oh shit.
[44:58.03]Okay.
[44:58.19]Leave with air ducts.
[44:59.09]Hide under beds.
[45:00.52]How do I turn this off?
[45:24.45]This is a good show.
[45:25.87]Antique vase.
[45:26.46]Bunch of shit.
[45:27.22]There's a hammer in here.
[45:55.11]I'm drinking the whole carton.
[45:56.57]I'm going to puke.
[45:57.63]Put it down.
[45:58.33]Put it down.
[46:00.60]Put it down.
[46:19.70]I'm just fucking this guy's whole apartment up.
[46:24.22]I drank soy milk in this person's apartment until I puked.
[46:27.63]There's still more.
[46:33.53]Okay, I need to fucking settle down.
[46:35.29]Honest to goodness.
[46:37.60]You got cameras in here?
[46:38.54]Oh shit.
[46:47.89]My god!
[46:48.27]Unknown citizen, new information.
[46:53.00]Dead.
[47:13.30]A bullet wound from low caliber aim.
[47:16.84]An 8mm or a 9x32.
[47:18.64]Wait, pin that.
[47:22.46]I'm examining the body.
[47:23.20]It appears that the victim has been shot to death with a pistol or revolver.
[47:25.86]I can determine the time of death is between 2345 and 1.
[47:27.40]Tuesday, January 3rd.
[47:27.78]Pin this.
[47:27.98]Tall.
[47:43.82]Unknown citizen.
[47:51.04]Find a photo ID.
[48:04.39]I need a light.
[48:04.89]How do I turn lights on?
[48:05.49]Oh!
[48:14.71]Infra networks.
[48:15.49]Killian DeWitt.
[48:17.99]Wait, this is Killian DeWitt on the ground.
[48:21.67]Connect.
[48:22.87]Okay.
[48:28.89]Put that right here.
[48:32.49]Got it.
[48:32.89]Okay.
[48:33.55]This is Killian DeWitt.
[48:34.33]Killian DeWitt is dead.
[48:43.46]A sword.
[48:50.26]How do I pick up this?
[48:52.86]How do I use the sword?
[48:54.96]What's that?
[48:55.26]What does that mean?
[48:56.72]What was that?
[48:57.04]What was that?
[48:58.86]Look around for a potential quick exit.
[49:03.20]Shit, I gotta pay attention.
[49:10.13]Vintage sword.
[49:15.31]I don't know whose sword this is.
[49:17.43]I'm gonna owe a thousand dollars.
[49:21.87]This is so... This game's awesome.
[49:23.11]Fuck.
[49:23.53]I'm like playing with all this guy's toys.
[49:44.98]Thank you for recently contacting us to request a life insurance policy.
[49:49.18]Do not meet the required social economic requirements for proof.
[49:51.80]Check out a range of alternatives.
[49:55.88]Okay, there was... There was a insurance policy taken out.
[50:00.41]How do I close this menu?
[50:06.47]F...
[50:08.48]Oh, right here.
[50:09.10]You can travel through buildings via ventilation duct.
[50:14.33]Simply open the grate.
[50:16.27]Okay.
[50:16.53]So did I, this is not what it wants me to do.
[50:47.56]Look around for vents.
[50:49.20]I just found it, right?
[50:50.06]The document's still on my menu.
[50:57.26]I still have a broken leg.
[51:00.88]Is it the bathroom?
[51:01.56]Just go in it?
[51:02.26]Okay.
[51:05.00]Well, I got info.
[51:17.66]Is it safe to go down here?
[51:42.55]That's killing alright.
[51:45.10]Just search the place for clues.
[51:47.32]But why did... Why did I go through the vent?
[51:51.90]Okay, hold on.
[51:58.32]Each citizen in the city has a unique fingerprint.
[52:00.67]You can scan for them using the fingerprint scanner device in your inventory.
[52:05.67]Point the scanner where you want to scan.
[52:07.07]Almost all surfaces can contain fingerprints.
[52:10.91]Unknown fingerprints will be found in sets, with set A being the first you find.
[52:14.90]Any matching prints will also be labeled to that corresponding set.
[52:19.36]Okay.
[52:21.20]For example, if you find set A at an apartment and subsequently at a bar, you can prove a citizen was in both locations at some point.
[52:29.48]Use right mouse button to inspect fingerprints after you've found them to pin them to your caseboard.
[52:35.37]They may disappear over time.
[52:38.55]Interesting.
[52:43.56]Somebody here?
[53:01.31]Looking for Prince.
[53:02.09]Turn the lights off.
[53:06.01]Prince, right here.
[53:06.85]Prince?
[53:09.75]Right there.
[53:10.30]Right there.
[53:10.72]Look at that.
[53:13.51]This is Killian DeWitt's fingerprint.
[53:17.27]Alright, pin that shit right here.
[53:25.50]Anything else?
[53:25.94]We're looking for other fingerprints.
[53:30.98]We don't know who this is.
[53:34.14]Okay.
[53:35.58]This is type B. We don't know who it belongs to.
[53:37.90]Pin that over here.
[53:42.76]Very, very cool.
[53:43.72]Okay.
[53:46.92]These prints don't belong to Killian and nobody else lives here.
[53:50.63]It's the killer, obviously.
[53:52.81]Isn't it obvious?
[54:03.01]How do I turn this TV off?
[54:03.99]Drugs?
[54:04.23]No, it's an eraser.
[54:05.25]Is it an eraser?
[54:13.79]Just hit him with the sword.
[54:16.27]Coin?
[54:16.59]No, how do I hit this?
[54:18.35]Shut this TV off.
[54:19.73]I can't turn the TV off.
[54:43.39]Pour milk on it! 54100
[55:12.36]Last caller was... Alright.
[55:18.24]Telephone call.
[55:19.54]Pin that shit.
[55:20.26]404-2676.
[55:20.90]You got it.
[55:55.93]It's like, oh Gregory, huh?
[56:00.98]Shut this fucking TV off.
[56:04.32]Evening, what's your name?
[56:07.22]As if I'd tell.
[56:11.15]Have you seen or heard anything unusual?
[56:18.65]Shit!
[56:19.21]Please, please.
[56:23.48]No!
[56:23.96]Please, he begged, as the knife flashed in the light of the cruncher.
[56:30.84]Please, you can have the promotion.
[56:34.17]On the office chair I tied him to.
[56:36.51]Aha!
[56:36.85]I said it is too late.
[56:38.11]You shouldn't have given the position to Jill.
[56:39.83]Now you will pay.
[56:40.61]He shrieked, but I took a printout of last quarter's fiscal report.
[56:45.37]Stuffed it in his mouth.
[56:46.08]Who's underperforming now?
[56:51.70]Did he write this?
[56:52.42]Taxi!
[56:57.92]Taxi!
[56:58.32]Save, save, save.
[57:03.88]What?
[57:04.30]What do you mean save?
[57:07.56]Oh my god.
[57:09.57]So make it work hard for you.
[57:10.91]Um, yes.
[57:11.55]Just ask your work about our paycheck exchange program and we'll take care of the rest.

[57:39.31]Chat, your job is to remind him to save because I don't think there's an auto-save.
[57:44.77]Yeah, but I wanted to understand what I was doing, Italic.
[57:51.16]Alright, what's this?
[57:53.58]I mean, it's connected to somebody.
[57:57.12]Should I call all these phone numbers?
[58:00.18]Oh, this is a lot of people.
[58:01.30]Okay.
[58:10.90]Who is this?

[62:34.08]The Menace of Charity?
[62:35.86]What is wrong with me?
[62:38.16]Honestly, what's going on?
[62:46.65]That's a lot of money.
[62:53.62]It's a $10,000 fine.
[62:56.72]I don't have that money.
[63:00.56]Can I sleep?
[63:03.70]Can I sleep this off?
[63:13.83]Oh, what the hell?
[63:18.41]Don't forget who owns you.
[63:20.09]Okay.
[63:22.75]A bandage?
[63:23.19]Ooh!
[63:24.55]Hold on, I need that.
[63:27.94]I don't need this.
[63:30.80]I need this, though.
[63:31.76]Use it right now.
[63:32.66]On my leg.
[63:39.20]Did I just eat the bandage?
[63:51.56]Remember your passcode this time.

[64:11.06]Now.
[64:16.48]This is kind of giving me a headache.

[64:43.75]This guy's eating food.
[64:46.51]Very cool.
[64:47.35]Okay.
[64:49.47]This is just a receipt.
[64:53.55]The silent alarm has been tripped.
[64:54.59]It means...
[64:56.17]What?
[64:57.59]Oh!
[65:00.44]How do I get under the bed?
[65:05.68]The dot in the middle of the screen displays how hidden you are.
[65:08.58]A hollow circle means you are completely obscured and others will only notice you if you get extremely close.
[65:14.00]A filled in circle means you're completely visible.
[65:19.71]Okay, so that means someone can see you.
[65:22.79]When things go wrong, you might have to resort to combat.
[65:27.42]Punch or block?
[65:28.88]Oh, God.
[65:31.04]Be careful, detective.
[65:31.80]Violence can escalate quickly.
[65:36.18]How do I get under the bed?
[65:38.28]How do I get under the bed?
[65:38.94]It told me to... It said I could get under the bed.

[76:54.20]In Shadows of Doubt, there are almost always multiple ways to carry out an investigation.
[76:57.64]Here are the current available leads.
[77:00.02]Choose one as a start to be guided through.
[77:01.36]Remember, in the main game, you'll have to think for yourself, detective.
[77:05.34]In addition, due to the simulated nature of the game, some leads could be dead ends.
[77:08.84]It's just part of the job.
[77:10.58]If you think you have enough information to solve the case, fill in the resolution form.
[77:16.48]Okay.

[91:54.20]So I'm looking for somebody that was in here with this dude, right?
[91:59.14]How come you look like you just got back from Survivor?

[93:16.75]You.
[93:17.71]No!
[93:18.25]Shit!
[93:26.16]Okay, you were there.
[93:31.94]And so were you.
[93:35.38]Alright.
[93:36.54]Interesting.
[93:38.12]What were you doing there?
[93:52.59]Interesting.

[94:05.29]Okay.
[94:06.75]I gotta talk to the janitor.
[94:11.86]Open an evidence window by inspecting the mugshot.
[94:13.90]Didn't I just do that?
[94:20.81]I didn't just do that?
[94:24.91]I need to click on... Okay, hold on.
[94:29.81]Sit down.
[94:33.08]This guy just doesn't care that I'm in here.
[94:50.52]No, I gotta track down this person here.
[94:51.98]Is it because you have the guest pass?
[94:55.52]Oh, so I was freaking out for no reason?
[94:56.83]Okay.
[95:01.22]Alright, so I need to figure out who that person is.
[95:03.78]So, I think I'm alright now.
[95:10.00]So, it was the janitor.
[95:12.60]Janitor.
[95:19.11]There it is.
[95:19.91]Okay.
[95:21.25]There you are.
[95:22.21]Janitor.
[95:25.61]Are you here now?
[95:26.29]Where's the janitor?
[95:34.25]Uh, do you know this person?
[95:37.14]I work with them.
[95:37.74]That's Lawrence Champion.
[95:40.26]Okay.
[95:42.24]Loves coffee.
[95:44.22]Saw them today at McCarthy Street around 7 a.m.
[95:49.54]To a nearby Butler Street.
[95:53.16]At itself.
[95:56.84]Okay.
[95:57.72]Thank you.
[96:00.70]Butler Street?
[96:04.16]So down that way.
[96:05.84]You didn't do the PC thing correctly?
[96:16.64]What did I do wrong?
[96:18.20]Surveillance?
[96:21.43]Go to the right time on Monday.
[96:23.73]Oh, I have to print it.
[96:24.67]Right, right, right.

[96:54.49]Who's that?
[96:55.79]What are you doing over here?
[96:57.99]Print that.
[96:58.53]And that too.
[97:14.53]Who's that?
[97:14.87]I don't know.
[97:23.04]OK.
[97:24.84]I got it.
[97:34.73]Are you pissed that I tried to pick up your burnt cigarette?
[97:39.59]I think I'm good.
[97:41.35]You missed the girl.
[97:43.59]Did?
[97:46.26]Well, somebody was just a waitstaff.
[97:48.44]It wasn't... Yeah, this is the waitstaff, right?
[97:58.55]I don't think this person is a person of interest.
[98:03.23]No, I got what I need.
[98:07.55]Oh my god, I just want to go back.
[98:08.80]I don't want... Come on.
[98:11.80]Store room?
[98:12.36]I got that one.
[98:13.56]Back room?
[98:16.33]Nothing?
[98:21.97]No, no, I got it.
[98:23.38]I got it right here.
[98:24.98]So where do you go?
[98:28.98]You're still kind of hanging out in here.
[98:33.08]Alright, you just take that photo.
[98:34.86]I don't even care.
[98:36.16]No, the other camera.
[98:47.46]The only footage of the... Wait, who's this?
[99:06.31]Unknown.
[99:09.37]Print that shit out.
[99:14.83]Did it run out of paper?
[99:16.23]Oh.
[99:24.57]Interesting.
[99:25.24]Pin that.
[99:29.92]Okay.
[99:30.62]You.
[99:31.46]I need to find out who you are.
[99:35.40]We're good.
[99:37.52]It's a paper jam.
[99:41.23]Dude, you are so smart.
[99:43.37]It's a complicated game and it's fun.
[99:47.65]Okay, good.
[99:48.67]Take that.
[99:48.97]It's free.
[99:49.23]Okay.
[99:54.04]I was just checking it.
[99:54.84]I needed to check it.
[99:55.90]I had to check it for fucking prints.
[99:58.86]I forgot I was on.
[99:59.96]Didn't I disable the camera?
[100:04.47]Are they checking the footage right now?
[100:12.05]Too bad there's not any more ink.
[100:14.69]Whatever, I got 25 bucks.
[100:16.03]They don't care.
[100:16.45]Alright, I need to talk to some people.
[100:20.99]Do you know who this is?
[100:25.08]Do you know this person?

[105:50.86]Could you provide your fingerprints for an investigation?
[105:57.76]I guess if it's for an investigation.
[106:09.95]Fingerprints.
[106:12.01]What kind of fingerprints are they?
[106:15.63]Shit.
[106:22.11]I was not done with my investigation.
[106:24.79]You said I could come in.

[108:07.90]I thought you went this way.
[108:28.07]Turkey sandwiches?
[108:29.65]Yep.
[108:31.04]Okay.
[108:32.22]So all this proves is that you were at the restaurant.

[109:20.69]Why does this... Why do you not want any lights on in your entire house?
[109:27.02]How do you navigate this apartment?
[109:36.74]What time is it?

[109:52.73]Barbecue sauce.

[109:57.85]I'm at a dead end.
[110:02.58]Shit.
[110:05.88]Actual dead end.
[110:14.13]I thought that was an animal.
[110:17.15]I'm so jumpy today too.

[111:31.73]What do I do?
[111:32.37]Okay, you're under?
[111:41.84]What do you mean, huh?
[111:44.12]Do you see what just happened in here?

[111:54.57]Fingerprints.
[111:56.55]What were they?
[111:58.80]These things hurt.
[112:01.62]Alright.
[112:02.54]What do you got on you?
[112:03.10]Pin that shit.
[112:08.40]Who are you?

[112:38.34]Is it B?
[112:41.73]Got you.
[112:42.47]You're under arrest.
[112:43.85]You're under arrest for killing at least two people.
[112:51.98]What do we do?
[112:57.10]Okay, how do I follow me down the stairs?
[112:58.90]The victim has been shot to death with a pistol.
[113:02.46]Time of death between 10 and 10.45.
[113:04.78]I was in the room.
[113:05.64]Alright, how do I... What do I do?
[113:10.15]Is there a way I can take you with me?
[113:16.65]Just leave them there?
[113:19.77]Wait.
[113:20.81]Okay.
[113:22.17]What is the full name of the killer?
[113:26.13]Right here.
[113:30.48]Arrest the killer.
[113:31.78]Yes.
[113:33.82]Do you have evidence that placed the killer at the crime scene?
[113:37.02]I do.
[113:37.66]I'm standing at it right now.
[113:39.43]I'm standing at the crime scene.
[113:41.67]This has been a murder.
[113:48.75]The fingerprints.
[113:49.33]Yep.
[113:51.53]Where's the fingerprints?
[113:52.95]Right here?
[113:55.65]Where's the killer?
[114:01.13]I don't know.
[114:02.87]Wasn't it on the, wait, I know.
[114:07.85]Uh, what was that, the thing I took?
[114:09.89]Wallet.
[114:12.05]No, no, no, no, stop, stop, stop.
[114:17.87]Right here.
[114:20.89]And that.
[114:21.31]Okay.
[114:24.27]I want to take the money out of this person's wallet.
[114:36.87]This is... Wait.
[114:37.99]I got so much bullshit everywhere.
[114:39.37]Click arrest.
[114:44.51]Have you located the murder weapon?
[114:45.77]I've got it.
[114:46.33]It's a gun.
[114:47.29]But I need to look at it again because I didn't pin it.
[114:52.70]Search them again?
[114:53.34]Okay, pin this.
[114:56.44]There we go.
[114:58.87]There it is.
[115:00.35]Plot route to hand in.
[115:02.05]Let's do it.
[115:05.11]Alright, you come with me.
[115:09.57]Let's go.
[115:12.29]Arrest.
[115:12.77]You're under arrest.
[115:16.49]Case closed.
[115:17.65]That was crazy.
[115:20.79]That was really, really crazy.
[115:26.17]Do I actually have to walk with them or do I just turn it in?
[115:29.82]You just leave?
[115:30.32]Okay.
[115:38.57]I was in the... What was I even doing in the other room?
[115:41.67]I'm... Okay.
[115:42.57]That was too much stimulation.
[115:43.71]I'm just going to go turn this in.
[115:46.55]There was a box to check a rest you didn't ticket.
[115:49.93]Really?
[115:57.02]No, no, no.
[116:01.77]No, I got it.
[116:02.43]Arrest.
[116:02.99]Right here.
[116:05.57]I got it.
[116:05.85]Yeah, I got it.
[116:06.45]I got it.
[116:06.71]I got it.
[116:10.16]No, I checked.
[116:13.72]Alright.
[116:14.46]Let's turn it in.
[116:17.72]That was crazy.
[116:21.51]That was really cool, though.
[116:22.11]That was fun.
[116:31.58]The thing we... Honestly, we just got into a random scenario.
[116:36.91]There is no connection between this person killing Killian.
[116:44.09]We have no connection.
[116:44.93]We just were in the room when another person died.
[116:53.86]Just caught him red-handed.
[116:55.76]Fingerprint.
[116:58.24]That's true.
[116:59.10]Yeah, that's true.
[116:59.64]You're right.
[117:02.42]Okay, let's go for it.
[117:04.92]Tutorial officially complete.
[117:06.86]I think I understand how the game works.
[117:28.50]I thought I was getting shot at.
[117:32.37]Okay.
[117:33.67]Case submitted for processing.
[117:34.77]Please wait for the results.
[117:46.58]I got five out of five.
[117:48.11]I got it.
[117:57.91]I got 250 social credit.
[118:00.99]2200 bucks.
[118:03.46]Social credit level up.
[118:11.66]Cool.
[118:16.43]Now what?
[118:21.19]I did it.
[118:25.54]Now you can change your name.
[118:28.02]You can change my name.
[118:32.26]Do I now just... Should I get rid of all this now, too?
[118:43.69]This is all not active anymore.
[118:50.35]Upright.
[118:51.19]Archive closed.
[118:52.01]Ooh, cool.
[118:54.27]Okay, so this has been resolved.
[118:55.33]Yeah.
[119:00.57]Close the case.
[119:01.07]You can take a side quest now or wait for another murder.
[119:04.28]Really?
[119:04.56]I can't close it at this moment.
[119:07.60]Why not?
[119:22.40]You don't have to wait for a murder.
[119:24.93]Murder someone, then frame someone else.
[119:26.51]I have to go back to the apartment.
[119:29.45]There's still more.
[119:35.78]Like this apartment?
[119:38.73]Wait, which apartment?
[119:55.81]Fine.
[119:57.55]Dude, this is a mess.
[119:59.12]I know it is.
[119:59.72]Sit on your bench with your watch out.
[120:09.84]It's locked.
[120:13.78]How do I just... Where even is my house?
[120:16.56]Just start a new sandbox game at this point?
[120:18.10]The game gets glitchy in Dead of Night after the murder.
[120:20.12]Okay.
[120:22.02]That makes sense to me.
[120:25.41]Alright, so sandbox.
[120:26.49]Solve and explore within the city your way.
[120:29.97]Generate a city.
[120:31.81]And, uh... Franklin's fine.
[120:39.79]Medium's fine.
[120:42.26]And let's do random.
[120:49.26]The game should be... Did you even save?
[120:52.58]Yeah, I did.
[120:57.71]Okay.
[120:58.93]Seems pretty good.
[121:00.05]Let's go.
[121:04.95]Yeah.
[121:05.75]Did I get one guy?
[121:06.95]I may have, but they said it was one guy said that sometimes they can bug out after that case.
[121:15.12]Shadows of doubt.
[121:20.36]One guy is actually correct.
[121:21.44]Okay.
[121:22.36]Cool.
[121:25.48]That was fun.
[121:34.11]Game's giving me a migraine.
[121:34.95]Can you please turn off all the lights and watch videos of fish?
[121:39.84]No.
[121:40.60]I'm sorry.
[121:44.20]I mean, I do enjoy videos of fish, but not right now.
[121:47.36]Maybe one day.
[121:53.21]How big do you think I can get this?
[122:00.75]So sandbox mode, something just happens and I have to figure it out.
[122:16.38]Shave your face, you cretin.
[122:21.04]No.
[122:30.19]I'm going to try to look as gross as I can.
[122:32.53]You know what I mean?
[122:34.73]I've never tried that before.
[122:39.15]You know, it always hits... It always hits a time when I haven't had a haircut in a while, I haven't shaved in a while, and I'm like, okay, alright, it's time to clean up a little.
[122:51.00]I think, I don't know, I just think, what if I just let it all go?
[122:54.52]And just let's see what happens after like a month, two months.
[123:00.33]No, well, I'm gonna get a trim and clean it up.
[123:05.75]No, no eyebrows.
[123:07.80]Just go for it and see what happens.
[123:10.50]Right now, Holly is probably sitting there going like, Okay.
[123:17.64]Yeah, let me just look like fucking crazed.
[123:22.93]Uh, no tutorial.
[123:25.17]I just turned it on.
[123:26.05]I thought it said no.
[123:27.45]I am fucking out of my mind.
[123:43.38]Can I... I seriously thought it said no.
[123:47.36]It's alright.
[123:47.92]I could probably still use them.
[123:52.58]Dumpster.
[123:55.40]Crash.
[123:56.84]What's in it?
[123:57.16]Okay.
[124:13.88]Evening.
[124:14.86]Evening.
[124:17.44]I'm sorry.
[124:30.40]Nothing?
[124:42.19]Don't worry about it.
[124:42.99]I just...
[124:46.96]I was trying to investigate.
[124:50.16]Packing tape.
[124:53.83]By default, there will be reported murder.
[124:57.97]Where?
[124:58.21]Where?
[124:58.41]Where?
[124:58.69]Where?
[124:58.83]Where?
[124:58.99]Where?
[124:59.19]Where?
[125:03.07]New murder case.
[125:04.47]Crime scene.
[125:06.28]1001 Gray Building.
[125:10.44]You also have access to a city district map that you have to toggle up.
[125:12.52]Where is it?
[125:19.09]1001 gray building.
[125:23.11]Use the map with F. There we go.
[125:32.60]That's what I was looking for.
[125:33.46]Okay, gray building.
[125:39.80]1001 gray building?
[125:40.70]Is that a name of a street?
[125:44.90]Or the name of a building?
[125:51.76]I can use the search.
[125:58.14]Wait, the color.
[126:00.63]No, it's not.
[126:01.89]Context menu?
[126:04.29]Search top left.
[126:12.08]Gray?
[126:13.76]Oh, there it is.
[126:16.26]Let's go.
[126:26.41]We get out of the way.
[126:28.37]As you know, there's been a murder.
[126:35.49]Depending on your activity, different kind of status.
[126:36.99]Yep, yep, yep.
[126:37.47]I already know that.
[126:38.87]Alright, what happened?
[126:40.48]Where are you?
[126:40.78]Where are you going?
[126:48.96]10th floor.
[126:49.80]Let's go.
[127:03.97]I don't know what happened there.
[127:26.28]Sound the alarm.
[127:26.88]Sound the alarm.
[127:27.56]I'm here.
[127:27.86]I'm here.
[127:28.08]I'm here.
[127:28.34]Detective.
[127:28.90]I'm here.
[127:29.18]I'm a detective.
[127:30.38]Open it up.
[127:32.70]Sound the alarm.
[127:33.82]I'm here.
[127:36.60]Open it.
[127:38.82]How do I open the door?
[127:39.56]I did.
[127:41.30]You need to get out of there.
[127:43.47]What do you mean no?
[127:45.93]I... How do I turn it off?
[127:47.93]I don't know what...
[127:59.08]What do I do?
[128:01.94]I don't know what to do.
[128:02.98]I don't know what happened.
[128:04.40]What's going on?
[128:05.74]What's going on?
[128:06.88]What's going on?
[128:07.62]Help.
[128:08.62]Help.
[128:11.42]Turn it off.
[128:12.20]Turn it off.
[128:12.76]Turn it off.
[128:16.78]What the fuck?
[128:18.24]What's happening?
[128:22.12]It's the killer.
[128:22.92]That's the killer.
[128:23.48]That's the killer right there.
[128:24.60]There's a killer.
[128:25.38]There's a killer.
[128:27.06]There's a killer.
[128:30.50]Stop this guy!
[128:40.99]Fucking shotgun.
[128:45.87]I don't understand what just happened.
[128:47.49]I'm so confused.
[128:52.25]I saw his face.
[128:53.46]I know what he looks like.
[128:54.34]He's bald and he's got glasses.
[128:56.66]I know...
[129:02.04]That dude shot me point blank like 10 times.
[129:05.42]He's bald and he's got glasses.
[129:06.55]I'm going, I know what he looks like.
[129:10.23]Medical fees.
[129:11.57]Bad.
[129:15.99]Get the fuck out of here.
[129:20.44]Don't you understand there's a killer on the loose?
[129:31.55]Alright, where is this guy?
[129:40.90]I'm going back there.
[129:44.24]Have any food?
[129:49.92]I'll take whatever you got.
[129:56.11]How do I buy something?
[130:07.22]I need, I need the hospital right now.
[130:18.07]No, God damn it.
[130:19.23]I just like alt tab.
[130:20.18]There we go.
[130:24.18]Where is the hospital?
[130:30.19]Hospital.
[130:33.36]Doctor?
[130:35.18]Drugstore.
[130:37.34]Come on, come on, come on.
[130:37.92]Hurry up.
[130:39.04]Hurry up, hurry up, hurry up.
[130:39.88]Go, go, go, go, go.
[130:42.58]Why is it?
[130:43.03]What's going on?
[130:43.79]Where'd it go?
[130:44.15]Okay.
[131:08.34]Give me a bandage.
[131:12.50]Where's all my money?
[131:21.86]Medical fees?
[131:22.82]What are you talking about?
[131:23.54]I had 2,200 bucks five minutes ago.
[131:27.28]That was a different save file.
[131:30.98]Oh, that's actually awful.
[131:34.02]Shit.
[131:34.48]Okay.
[131:36.15]Now that's why I shouldn't have left.
[131:45.79]shit um am I actually screwed here or if if I just reload this will it fix it just rob the medicine cabinet I guess I could
[132:13.97]Fuck off with this.
[132:18.23]Oh, you got like trophies back here.
[132:20.07]Where's the medicine?
[132:38.74]What time is this?
[132:43.38]I'm just gonna start over.
[132:45.38]That got so screwed up.
[132:47.24]I went there, there's somebody screaming at me to turn the alarm on, I turn the alarm on, a guy with a shotgun shoots me five times in the face, and then I get up.
[132:53.82]I think I'm just gonna restart.
[132:55.80]I'm just gonna restart.
[133:10.71]Okay.
[133:15.20]You're a bigger public menace than the murderer.
[133:23.46]Okay.
[133:24.41]Let's try this again.
[133:25.55]That one actually doesn't count.
[133:29.83]Sorry I'm so jumpy.
[133:36.74]That was kind of a mess though.
[133:38.10]Give me a little bit of slack.
[133:47.82]So in conclusion, you trespassed, started breaking a fire alarm, got shot, ran from the hospital, robbed a drugstore, and gave up.
[133:55.39]There was somebody behind the screen screaming for me, please, please sound the alarm.
[134:04.05]I just did what I saw.
[134:06.47]There was an opportunity to maybe get some more people to help.
[134:08.63]And maybe we need to, something happened here.
[134:11.17]I was told to do it.
[134:13.84]I pulled it and then I couldn't turn it off.
[134:15.50]I couldn't get into that side of the apartment building.
[134:19.42]And then a shotgun was in my face.
[134:28.49]Does that mean that I get to have a shotgun at some point?
[134:35.38]I mean, it has to imply that I can use a shotgun at some point.
[134:44.88]This game is crazy.
[134:46.10]This is fun.
[134:47.00]I like this.
[134:48.02]I was just choked.
[134:53.42]You sabotage the alarm.
[134:55.30]Well, I just... I don't know.
[134:56.67]There's a lot of loud sounds.
[134:58.05]Okay.
[135:13.44]Off.
[135:15.38]Here we go.
[135:15.92]Let's get this started.
[135:17.14]This is the real one now.
[135:20.68]No one messing around.
[135:22.20]This is the real deal.
[135:27.34]Uh, we already know the story here.
[135:30.94]We can just skip this, right?
[135:33.91]Okay.
[135:34.93]Here we go.
[135:35.39]6 p.m.
[135:37.85]Monday, January 2nd.
[135:39.33]Carpenter Street.
[135:39.99]How you doing?
[135:46.58]Uh, what's your name?
[135:48.12]I'm Joanne Callahan.
[135:49.68]What's it to you?
[135:51.78]Have a good day.
[135:58.85]Whatever.
[136:04.95]What's the world coming to?
[136:07.51]Everybody really wants to be around this fire.
[136:15.84]There's a lot of people here.
[136:17.04]Okay.
[136:25.76]Is the fight breaking out?
[136:28.67]Somebody said I had enough.
[136:29.59]Hey you, this street is a toll.
[136:33.87]Pay up.
[136:34.25]Get lost.
[136:39.71]You'll regret this decision.
[136:45.10]What is going... This person has a knife!
[136:48.18]This person has a knife!
[136:49.90]This person has a knife!
[136:51.82]Help!
[136:52.98]This person has a knife!
[137:04.67]Am I being attacked by all of you now?
[137:07.91]This person has a knife!
[137:14.36]Get out of the way.
[137:17.09]Are you serious?
[137:21.69]I have to run.
[137:22.69]I have to run.
[137:23.49]Somebody help me.
[137:26.95]Somebody help me.
[137:28.13]I'm being chased.
[137:31.18]I'm being chased.
[137:31.94]I'm being chased.
[137:32.98]I'm being chased.
[137:35.72]I don't know what I'm supposed to do, but please help.
[137:42.53]Get away from me.
[137:55.24]Dude, how do I call the police?
[137:57.76]How do I... Murder!
[138:00.94]There's been a murder.
[138:01.52]There's been a murder.
[138:02.10]It's probably one of you.
[138:03.92]New murder case.
[138:10.26]1102... What was it?
[138:15.22]Bryant Terrace.
[138:16.93]Where am I?
[138:21.93]You are the police.
[138:24.81]That was so fucked up.
[138:26.57]Why?
[138:26.97]1102.
[138:26.99]Now I have to go to the hospital again.
[138:40.02]I don't even have any money.
[138:41.24]I got jumped?
[138:49.24]I didn't even identify any of those people either.
[138:50.90]I was just so fucked up.
[138:57.48]Help?
[139:00.04]Help, help, help.
[139:05.62]Wait.
[139:06.26]Was this the person that had the knife?
[139:14.23]Come here.
[139:14.59]Get over here.
[139:15.97]Get over here.
[139:16.51]It was...
[139:27.13]Give me a second?
[139:30.57]Okay.
[139:31.31]I'm gonna give you a second.
[139:32.33]I'm gonna give you the count of three.
[139:35.27]Before I... drop you.
[139:52.24]Why am I the bad guy here?
[139:53.62]This doesn't make any sense.
[140:01.88]I don't want to get... Who is this?
[140:19.91]Are these... Oh, thanks for showing up.
[140:23.45]Thanks for helping.
[140:28.87]They went this way.
[140:29.29]They're right here.
[140:33.29]It was... No, wait.
[140:33.93]Where are they?
[140:42.63]What is happening?
[140:43.45]I don't know.
[140:43.91]I think they're after... I don't... I don't know who they're after.
[140:50.03]Wait.
[140:50.81]Oh.
[140:53.65]I'm just gonna die.
[140:55.13]I need to restart again.
[141:02.03]I got stabbed 10 times.
[141:05.03]No reason.
[141:16.60]Where are we?
[141:17.12]What are we doing?
[141:19.58]Somebody's in the building.
[141:20.82]There's a murderer in the building.
[141:22.43]Are they still here?
[141:31.71]Okay, there's something going on.
[141:33.13]I should have just taken the elevator.
[141:43.41]What am I doing?
[141:45.27]What floor am I on?
[141:55.51]Okay.
[141:58.46]How do I get in here?
[142:03.83]How do I get in there?
[142:04.52]Alright, let's do an investigation here.
[142:07.94]Hey.
[142:08.10]Can I come in and help?
[142:42.52]Do I have the right house?
[142:52.35]1-1-0-2.
[142:57.59]What is... 1-1... Why is this backwards?
[143:03.48]Wait, there is a... Is there a... There is a body on the ground.
[143:07.06]Oh my god!
[143:08.68]Somebody's in the... Don't!
[143:11.00]No!
[143:11.20]Wait, wait, wait.
[143:11.94]I...
[143:14.30]What are you doing?
[143:15.92]Stop!
[143:18.16]Hold on!
[143:19.66]Oh my god, guys, what have I done?
[143:21.62]I... Your... This shit is backwards.
[143:27.05]Your door number is backwards.
[143:33.57]What?
[143:34.03]Who has the gun?
[143:37.32]Get me out!
[143:38.20]Be careful, careful, careful, careful, careful.
[143:39.80]Careful.
[143:41.70]Who has a gun?
[143:42.30]Do you...
[143:45.90]Let me in!
[143:47.18]I'm out on the fucking deck!
[143:49.54]Let me in!
[143:49.98]I'm out on the fucking ledge!
[143:56.00]Can somebody let me in?
[143:58.09]They locked me out.
[143:59.47]They locked me out on the ledge.
[144:05.83]Oh no!
[144:09.95]Shit, how do I get back in?
[144:23.99]There's nowhere to go.
[144:24.87]I have to restart the whole fucking thing.
[144:26.41]Oh my god.
[144:26.95]There's nowhere to go.
[144:29.81]I was stuck.
[144:30.27]God damn it.
[144:44.13]That was so ridiculous.
[144:48.00]The window opened?
[145:07.17]You can't WM1 a murder investigation.
[145:15.12]Yeah, but hold on though.
[145:17.60]Let's calm down and think about this for a second.
[145:20.90]The last couple, I've tried to generate new seeds.
[145:25.18]First seed.
[145:26.60]I just get attacked.
[145:28.44]I just get stabbed and chased and four people are attacking me, killing me.
[145:33.32]No, that's not even the first one.
[145:34.92]A shotgun pointed in my face.
[145:36.46]Shot.
[145:37.05]Boom.
[145:39.19]I get surrounded and attacked.
[145:40.71]I go up with the police to help investigate and all of a sudden they start shooting.
[145:45.97]That was the killer in there apparently because they were firing at each other.
[145:49.73]I get pushed out to the balcony.
[145:51.43]I'm just standing out there.
[145:55.98]I don't even know what happened.
[145:59.65]You're a private detective?
[146:06.89]You can't be at the crime scene.
[146:08.03]You're not part of the police.
[146:16.58]This game is wonderful.
[146:18.18]This is really fun.
[146:21.31]It's just things can just happen.
[146:24.78]Everybody is just doing something.
[146:29.33]This is great.
[146:39.84]Okay.
[146:41.30]I'm getting some advice in the chat.
[146:42.96]I'm going to listen to it.
[146:46.14]I'm going to save immediately after loading up the game.
[146:49.64]Looks good.
[146:51.20]Okay.
[146:52.58]No more insanity.
[146:53.84]No more craziness.
[146:54.58]No more wild behavior from my end.
[146:59.22]I'm good.
[147:00.80]I'm going to just simply walk down the street like a normal citizen.
[147:11.17]I'm just hanging out.
[147:14.69]How are you?
[147:15.15]It's good to see you.
[147:16.13]It's okay.

[186:08.28]I can't sit on the toilet.
[186:16.04]There's no body even in here, by the way.
[186:18.33]If it's not, I can't.
[186:19.19]Press G. I can puke with G. No, I can't.
[186:22.21]It's a lie.
[186:24.85]I am actually... Okay, I need to reload the save.
[186:32.13]Find a trash can.
[186:36.45]Find a trash can?
[186:39.11]That's the solution?
[186:47.15]Right here.
[186:51.04]I can't puke in it.
[186:54.02]I can't puke in it.
[186:55.10]I...
[187:02.12]I can't puke in any receptacle.
[187:04.78]Sit on the couch.
[187:12.92]Alright, this actually is starting... This is going to hurt everyone's brain.
[187:18.66]Go drink water.
[187:26.21]Press G on the toilet.
[187:29.19]Jump off the landing.
[187:30.41]Just jump out and reload.
[187:50.70]Oh, it's getting better.
[187:57.18]Do a flip?
[187:59.10]Press G, dude.
[188:00.29]G doesn't do anything.
[188:08.37]Use your watch to wait.
[188:18.44]I don't think I can do anything.
[188:21.34]sit and use the watch I'm just trying to get out of here jump I'm giving this 30 more seconds that I'm reloading I actually didn't I didn't even do that I didn't do that I actually just walked off there accidentally
[188:47.11]I didn't do that.
[188:48.65]When I press W, he picks a random direction and walks.
[188:51.31]I have a bad egg.
[188:58.22]I've been arrested.
[189:14.57]Three stooges aren't in Fortnite yet.
[189:16.01]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[189:18.55]I've been pissed off about it for at least a few years.
[189:23.90]Oh, I feel so great now.
[189:25.34]I can actually see what's happening.
[189:29.66]Okay, let's get back into that apartment.
[189:55.54]I am fresh.
[189:56.20]Let's go.
[189:59.42]Although I should collect the thing from City Hall, right?
[190:02.90]To be on the case.
[190:08.49]Oh, this is City Hall.
[190:12.41]Okay.
[190:14.19]Case of the Corpo Assassin.
[190:17.61]You got it.
[190:23.62]Back to it.
[190:28.31]I got a rash when I opened my Grotto Beasts Pack.
[190:32.11]I don't think we had anything to do with that.
[190:42.60]Where does the killer live?
[190:44.58]What weapon?
[190:45.16]Do you have evidence that... Okay.
[190:47.24]Let's see if I can get in there now.
[190:56.63]Ninth floor.
[191:06.47]I know.
[191:07.39]I just want to... I have to apologize to everybody here.
[191:10.71]Yes.
[191:11.99]I am the guy last night that was drunk and walked off the banister.
[191:17.36]I just want to say sorry.
[191:18.80]I caused a little bit of a problem for everybody.
[191:24.50]I may have walked around and... I think I knocked on a bunch of people's doors.
[191:28.39]I was trying to find a killer.
[191:31.85]I think.
[191:32.59]What that was, I believe...
[191:41.71]Oh, this is my friend!
[191:45.89]What's going on, Luke?
[191:49.04]Luke is shit-faced.
[192:13.99]Remember when I had the katana?
[192:18.11]Remember that?
[192:18.47]That was kind of cool.
[192:28.55]I know, just take the elevator.
[192:29.85]Okay, just take it now.
[192:31.81]Oh my goodness.
[192:35.05]Good thing I looked.
[192:50.78]It was one, it was two boys up.
[192:53.30]Why did I even get in here?
[192:59.67]Okay, it's time to start my investigation.
[193:12.09]Save it here.
[193:21.86]Okay, where's the body?
[193:41.77]I thought that was a knife.
[193:44.77]Oh, this is not the right place.
[193:48.82]This is wrong.
[193:53.73]I just took his glasses.
[193:55.01]Come on, dude.
[193:56.67]Really?
[193:58.03]What are you doing?
[193:58.43]What are you thinking?
[194:01.02]How do I put... I want to take... I want to put those down.
[194:07.52]Am I wearing them?
[194:15.65]Okay, that was wrong.
[194:18.17]It's this one here.
[194:30.62]Go.
[194:30.68]Alright, what do we got?
[194:43.22]Fingerprints, let's look.
[194:47.66]There's no body, though.
[194:49.18]Weirdly enough.
[194:49.82]Where's the body?
[194:54.50]Right here.
[195:00.93]Type C. Type C. Where's the body?
[195:17.03]To pin... To pin in it?
[195:24.79]To pin in it.
[195:29.94]What is this saying?
[195:36.29]Put a pin in it?
[195:37.37]Alright, I need to find the keypad.
[195:46.81]Alright, you got something here.
[195:47.95]Type C?
[195:51.23]Money?
[195:51.45]Alright, what is this?
[195:57.82]Chevalier Mine.
[196:02.48]Lots of fingerprints.
[196:04.32]Anybody else in here?
[196:07.42]Just C for now.

[196:17.05]No, C. C. C. Where's the body?
[196:23.97]Ooh, food.
[196:41.97]This is a mess.
[196:42.74]I have to get rid of all this stuff.
[196:48.08]Why is this even pinned?
[196:52.12]This shouldn't be pinned either.
[196:53.00]This guy has nothing to do with any of this.
[196:58.91]It's newspaper.
[196:59.77]Why am I even... Okay, cool.
[197:11.53]Dirty plate.
[197:16.79]Type C. Can I smoke this?
[197:30.04]Ooh.

[197:48.92]Candy.
[197:49.30]Matchbox.
[197:54.14]Is that a knife?
[197:58.54]Utility knife?
[198:07.72]Read the newspaper again.
[198:16.33]Ooh, I have a knife now.
[198:20.25]Did I just stab myself?
[198:22.33]No, okay, good.
[198:25.09]What's that?
[198:26.01]Matchbook.
[198:44.00]Soap.
[198:44.22]Food.
[198:47.55]Find the body, please.
[198:51.57]Where is it?
[198:52.01]There's no other rooms.
[198:56.55]Maybe this is a clue.
[198:58.11]Put a pin in it.
[198:59.13]Oh, hold on.
[199:20.56]Birth control pills?
[199:23.44]Okay.

[199:28.90]What's this?
[199:29.88]Oh.

[199:38.64]They must earn my respect.
[199:40.04]What the fuck?
[199:50.42]Okay.
[199:51.78]Fingerprints probably match, right?
[199:53.56]A wound caused by a sharp object or blade.
[199:55.18]When we examine the body, it appears the victim has been slashed to death by a bladed weapon.
[200:01.37]I can determine the time of death as between 1745 and 1900.
[200:03.07]Monday, January 2nd, 1979.
[200:10.02]And that.

[207:41.70]I don't know.
[207:42.28]Okay, let's go.
[207:44.16]That was weird.

[207:50.64]You guys need to tell me to stop when I do that.
[207:53.45]I'm relying on you.
[208:03.07]Alright, that was fairly clean this time.
[208:04.77]Let's go to the work.
[208:17.82]Workplace.
[208:19.56]I'll save it when I get out.
[208:25.87]What should I name my baby?
[208:26.85]Uh, Frank.
[208:28.31]Frank.
[208:35.09]Alright, let's move.
[208:44.66]I do have a weapon though.
[208:45.72]I have a knife now.
[209:03.78]Do you know what I wanted to try?
[209:04.84]Because I've never really had it.
[209:06.59]I think I've only had it maybe once ever.
[209:11.11]White Castle.
[209:13.29]Is White Castle any good?
[209:17.12]I saw this fucking YouTube video where it showed how they make it.
[209:23.89]Did you guys know?
[209:24.49]Am I completely full of shit here?
[209:27.29]But they make these little patties, these little squares, and they put five holes.
[209:34.27]One, two, three, four, five.
[209:36.04]Almost looks like a dice.
[209:38.30]And they put it on a flat top, and they don't flip it.
[209:41.88]They don't flip the burger.
[209:44.32]They put it on the flat top.
[209:45.32]It's so small.
[209:46.86]They put it on a bed of onions.
[209:50.77]It's on a bed of chopped onions.
[209:52.77]They put the meat right on top, and then the steam from the water, they put a bun on top, and it cooks the other side too.
[209:59.37]And then they pick it up weirdly.
[210:02.25]I also saw that YouTube short.
[210:03.55]Yeah, I did too.
[210:06.67]I just wanted it.
[210:07.41]It made me want it.
[210:11.70]Has anybody in this chat eaten White Castle before?
[210:21.25]yes yes it yes it's very bad it's repulsive what it's good it's good it's good it's amazing it's ass it's average
[210:50.36]It's good in a disgusting way.
[210:54.44]Alright, what was I doing going up, right?
[210:59.38]What am I even doing here?
[211:03.69]Is this the business?
[211:07.51]Revenue Tree Networks.
[211:08.81]It is.
[211:09.63]Is the business just in somebody's apartment or something?
[211:12.33]Or is it?
[211:12.59]No, this is an office.
[211:20.76]Where is it?
[211:28.77]What floor is it on?
[211:32.35]Oh.
[211:41.24]White Castle fucking sucks, dude.
[211:45.10]I feel like people are too harsh.
[211:49.05]I can't imagine driving through the White Castle drive-thru with... Holding up the glasses on the stick.
[211:58.72]The mustache and, like, slick back hair and stuff.
[212:01.60]Just go and eat it.
[212:02.60]Is it really that bad?
[212:04.58]Like, you go into White Castle, you know what you're doing.
[212:06.47]You know what you're getting.
[212:09.31]It's just fast food.
[212:10.35]It's just like a fast food burger.
[212:12.59]Nothing wrong with that.
[212:15.73]Okay, here it is.
[212:26.21]I am afraid to open this door.
[212:31.75]Is there... Okay, there's a sentry gun in there.
[212:33.97]Is that a camera?
[212:36.31]Alright, how do I... I gotta do this right.
[212:40.47]Don't be an idiot.
[212:47.71]McDonald's is the best restaurant in the world.
[212:55.87]Why do I feel like you were standing up, hovering over your microphone, and just saying it loudly like this?
[213:06.70]And then it was like, ah!
[213:08.02]You hurt something here.
[213:09.48]It was like, ow!
[213:28.80]Alright.
[213:30.86]So... Can I knock?
[213:35.34]Is anybody here?
[213:42.35]There's nobody here.
[213:43.57]It's late at night.
[213:45.67]I have to turn this off.
[213:47.95]But how am I going to get in there without being seen?
[213:55.10]I'm just going to go for it.
[213:55.94]Whatever.
[213:56.26]I saved it.
[214:03.44]Oh my god.
[214:09.64]Well.
[214:12.26]Never mind.
[214:12.66]I can't break through?
[214:27.66]Any lockpick stuff here?
[214:33.50]Buy more lockpicks at City Hall.
[214:37.00]Yeah.
[214:38.60]Shit.
[214:39.82]Okay, well, I'll... I just gotta come back.
[214:44.24]Let me just go to City Hall.
[215:00.30]Use the window?
[215:01.88]Wait, wait, wait, what, what, what?
[215:08.66]It was a window?
[215:09.14]It was a vent?
[215:22.15]Really?
[215:22.45]There is a vent.
[215:48.66]Or is it... Is this illegal?
[215:51.38]Alright, where does that vent go?
[216:24.22]Is this the right place?
[216:33.19]I think this is somebody's kitchen.
[216:42.39]No, it is.
[216:42.77]Okay, we're good.
[216:43.11]Turn the lights off.
[217:33.01]Oh.
[218:14.18]Okay, what do I need here?
[218:21.69]This is wrong.
[218:22.43]Yeah, this is the wrong office.
[218:27.52]Well, I'm not leaving empty handed.
[218:29.14]I'm not leaving empty handed.
[218:43.56]I don't even know who any of these people are, but... Oh, damn it.
[219:06.31]Shit.
[219:13.07]Oh, it's locked!
[219:18.03]Oh my... No, no, you didn't see anything.
[219:26.57]So how do I get to the other office?
[219:36.61]This way and then down, maybe?
[219:38.39]I don't know.
[219:41.05]Wait, where did I... No, I came from here.
[219:44.37]Straight and then left.
[219:57.84]This is it right here.
[219:59.80]Has to be.
[220:04.53]Yep.
[220:08.13]Um, wait.
[220:30.41]Like my nose is bleeding.
[220:46.47]I don't know where I'm going.
[220:54.45]This might be correct.
[221:02.64]Did I make it?
[221:09.73]Who has any idea where I even am?
[221:14.37]Um... I... You're on the wrong floor now.
[221:19.08]What floor am I on?
[221:37.17]Fuck.
[221:45.26]Can I even get there through here?
[222:07.15]I need lockpicks.
[222:11.63]Oh my god, it worked!
[222:13.06]Jesus.
[222:51.18]Alright, what we got?
[222:52.38]Don't be so loud, stop.
[222:59.92]Okay, I need to know.
[223:00.74]I don't know what the passwords are.
[223:01.76]You got any cameras in here?
[223:12.59]What?
[223:14.09]What does that mean?
[223:25.45]It's hot sauce?
[223:31.48]Oh my guts!
[223:46.18]What is this?
[223:46.72]Tea box?
[223:54.03]Okay, this is just like the employee food lounge, right?
[223:56.77]There's nothing really here.
[223:59.29]Wait, hold on.
[224:00.01]To all employees, the door code in my office has been reset to 5390.
[224:02.65]Okay.
[224:03.09]5390.
[224:03.23]Let's go.
[224:03.76]Okay.
[224:25.38]Alright, what do we got?
[224:25.90]What do I do?
[224:56.78]Oh, that's bad.
[224:57.66]Batman.
[224:58.08]Just diving up.
[225:25.15]You know what my character really needs?
[225:28.51]Just one of those party store masks.
[225:32.66]They're usually like purple and they have glitter all over them.
[225:37.40]You know what I mean?
[225:38.56]And they have a band that snaps and it just covers right here.
[225:43.08]I just need some of that.
[225:44.75]I need one of those.
[225:52.84]No, not the scream mask.
[225:55.16]It's a masquerade mask.
[225:56.76]Okay, yeah, that's what it is.
[226:01.48]Alright, let me do this again and not screw it up.
[226:05.69]A Mardi Gras mask?
[226:07.79]Whatever it is.
[226:08.37]I don't...
[226:33.84]Okay.
[226:35.28]Now what do I do about this?
[226:47.37]It's connected to that.
[226:48.39]Can I sabotage this here?
[226:53.60]Will it see me?
[226:54.14]I have no lockpicks.
[226:57.12]This is such a joke.
[227:03.03]Office.
[227:03.51]Yeah, I got that already.
[227:07.67]SR.
[227:08.15]Remember your password this time.
[227:09.87]Is this somebody new?
[227:30.56]Use box maybe in the...
[227:40.57]Of course it is.
[227:42.57]I'm just gonna put all these employees down here.
[227:57.31]Okay, this is the director.
[228:12.56]Okay, so this is the director of this company.
[228:19.97]I don't think I need both of this.
[228:21.11]No, I don't.
[228:26.93]Receptionist.
[228:37.46]Head of HR.
[228:38.24]Here we go.
[228:38.90]Okay.
[228:40.74]What about you?
[228:43.60]QA team.
[228:54.21]Marketing.
[229:05.78]It's one of these people.
[229:06.68]Has to be.
[229:17.12]Now I know who they all are.
[229:18.04]Hey dude, when's the next toilet water drinking stream?
[229:22.60]Can you let me know?
[229:24.00]You missed it by a few months.
[229:37.35]Okay.
[229:38.67]I think I just have to get in there.
[229:40.99]I wish I had lockpicks.
[229:42.69]It's so stupid to not have them here.
[229:45.73]Does this also work on the computer?
[229:47.79]Was it 5.3?
[229:48.81]Was it?
[229:57.50]It does.
[229:58.46]Ooh, it does work here.
[230:00.00]This is perfect.
[230:01.00]Okay.
[230:05.20]That's some new info.
[230:08.34]What are you doing?
[230:11.23]New info.
[230:12.97]Alright.
[230:14.25]We know...
[230:16.46]who you are.
[230:22.02]I want this, um, this telephone number.
[230:27.11]I think it's just in the notes, right?
[230:34.17]Okay.
[230:34.49]1501 Rough Towers, and then here's the telephone number.
[230:43.56]Okay.
[230:44.96]Good.
[230:48.37]What about mail?
[230:49.11]What about the mail?
[230:57.04]Okay, so this is the email that they had together.
[231:01.78]To... Sherman.
[231:04.58]Hi, honey bunny.
[231:06.26]Don't forget to pick up milk on the way home.
[231:08.38]Interesting.
[231:22.30]Interesting.
[231:26.25]Lunch date?
[231:27.67]Interesting.
[231:33.35]Interesting.
[231:33.79]What?
[231:33.97]What do you mean Trump voice?
[231:35.08]There's a person.
[231:42.08]Oh my god, what's going on?
[231:46.80]What time is it?
[231:47.33]I gotta get out of here.
[231:55.26]Okay.
[231:57.92]I need to go pay a visit.
[232:03.21]So we've got another person to... I'm going to call.
[232:06.39]Should I show up or call?
[232:08.89]Call or show up.
[232:09.53]What do you think?
[232:15.95]There's more?
[232:16.49]There probably is more, but, I mean, look at what time it is.
[232:20.39]It's... The day is starting.
[232:22.17]People are going to start coming to work.
[232:24.60]Just show up.
[232:25.42]Okay.
[232:27.52]What do we got?
[232:35.12]Alright.
[232:35.58]1501 Rough Towers.
[232:36.46]Let's find that.
[232:45.35]Let's go.
[232:49.81]This system is really cool.
[232:50.81]It's really fun.
[232:53.43]This was overwhelming at first, but I'm starting to understand what they want you to do.
[232:56.89]Starting to get it.
[232:58.19]Especially, look at how far you can zoom out.
[232:59.17]Alright, let's get out of here.
[233:12.96]We're four hours in and you finally understand?
[233:16.12]Yeah, but I mean, it takes a little bit.
[233:19.05]It takes a minute.
[233:19.71]It takes a while before you really get what's going on.
[233:30.32]You can do folders for different cases.
[233:31.88]That's cool.
[233:42.32]It's complex, but it's not complicated.
[233:45.65]That's a big deal.
[233:48.13]This game is very complex, but it is not complicated.
[233:54.35]It's really only a few different systems to learn.
[233:56.42]Let's go...
[234:12.58]Alright, here we go.
[234:13.30]I gotta be prepared.
[234:19.31]I got a knife, right?
[234:19.95]I mean, don't use it now, but... Okay, it's in my slot.
[234:30.44]15th floor.
[234:31.36]This is gonna take a million years to get up there, so... Just close it up.
[234:35.60]All the way at the top.
[234:49.48]Can you fight in this game?
[234:50.56]You can.
[234:51.70]You can punch.
[234:52.38]You can stab.
[234:53.34]You can swing.
[234:54.00]I don't know if there's any weapons.
[234:58.60]Like guns?
[235:00.65]Other people have been using guns on me.
[235:02.41]Not the other way around.
[235:10.93]This is a pretty ominous apartment.
[235:13.81]Okay, well, let's... Good evening.
[235:36.15]Fuck.
[235:37.71]Good evening.
[235:39.48]I'm a private investigator trying to figure out a murder case.
[235:44.83]I'd like to speak with you for a few moments, if I could.
[235:50.87]Oh, keep your nose out of my business.
[235:52.39]Interesting.
[235:55.69]Do you know, um... Do you know Yin, by any chance?
[236:01.15]Oh, I saw them somewhere around, uh... Wait.
[236:05.70]Mind if I come take a look around?
[236:06.78]Not a chance, huh?
[236:15.78]Thank you.
[236:50.21]I don't really know where to go at this point.
[237:00.25]Type E. Type F. Type F and type E. Interesting.
[237:18.15]Type E. Who does it belong to?
[237:20.33]Type D. Shit.
[237:32.62]Shit.
[237:35.26]I don't think it's anybody here.
[237:36.16]Type F.
[238:05.86]Good evening.
[238:09.12]No, I just was here, but I have a few other things I want to ask you.
[238:14.67]I wanted to get a look at your face.
[238:15.75]That's all I wanted.
[238:22.07]Do you know who this is?
[238:23.97]That's my partner, Seo Yun-ri.
[238:26.23]Interesting.
[238:27.41]Suffers from insomnia.
[238:30.46]They live with me.
[238:33.38]You're here right now.
[239:17.02]Can't I connect that this is this person here?
[239:21.04]I can't connect that this is Leela?
[239:25.43]Leela?
[239:36.23]I can't make this connection yet.
[239:43.97]Custom string.
[239:47.24]Hmm.
[239:49.32]I'm gonna call them.
[239:51.00]Okay, I'm gonna call them.
[239:58.72]I'm sorry, but I had to bother you, but I want to know, are you this person?
[240:01.48]I'm gonna make it really scary.
[240:21.47]Sorry to bother you.
[240:22.89]Again?
[240:23.13]They know it's me.
[240:35.43]Shit.
[240:37.87]Can I- Can I come use your phone?
[240:40.33]Can I borrow your phone for a minute?
[240:52.43]How are you?
[240:54.71]How are you?
[240:56.13]Do you mind if I come and take a look around?
[240:58.53]Not a chance.
[240:59.01]Do you mind if I use your phone?
[241:01.62]What's your name?
[241:02.16]Um, anything unusual?
[241:06.44]Maybe from upstairs?
[241:07.70]No?
[241:07.82]None of my business.
[241:12.62]Do you know this per- Well then at least give me some money.
[241:36.53]Can I borrow your phone?
[241:37.79]I just want to call the house.
[241:44.16]You're pathetic.
[241:52.44]Hi.
[241:54.16]Do you mind if I come in?
[241:55.54]Why the hell would I let you in?
[241:56.66]Because I'm... You got any snacks?
[242:06.70]Alright, fuck it.
[242:07.72]I'm just...
[242:43.79]My investigation is nearing complete.
[242:46.97]I suggest you and your friend in there tread wisely.
[243:00.43]I got- how did he get up?
[243:18.34]Okay.
[243:19.52]I don't... How do I... I don't know what to do.
[243:21.70]I gotta wait.
[243:23.24]I need to... Don't they work?
[243:29.80]I don't have any lockpicks.
[243:32.24]That's so important.
[243:34.34]I'm just gonna go back to City Hall, get a bunch of lockpicks, come back up here, and see if I can get in.
[243:45.79]I could've gone in the elevator by now.
[243:54.23]Have you been enjoying this granny-like?
[243:55.67]It's not a granny-like.
[243:58.53]That's not a granny-like.
[243:59.59]You've got that completely wrong.
[244:00.91]Let me just correct you really quickly.
[244:02.26]I don't want to publicly correct you, but we need to get some things straight here.
[244:07.04]Granny-like is when...
[244:10.43]in this room there is a piece of bubble gum and then 500 meters that way in a different building there is a sink that has a pipe underneath the sink that I can put the bubble gum on and then what that does is that stops up the drain or that that allows the water to fill up so I can get the stick that comes up then I can come back here wedge the stick into the door by the way none of this stuff is ever explained wedge the stick in the door to open the door
[244:41.27]And the whole time, there's a monster running behind you.
[244:46.06]That's a granny leg.
[244:49.00]And by the way, that chain of events is six hours long.
[244:53.44]That's a lie.
[244:54.08]It's like 40 minutes.
[244:55.42]But you get it.
[244:55.86]That's literally Resident Evil.
[245:08.47]It's not.
[245:10.22]Resident Evil has a map.
[245:13.40]Resident Evil has a pretty detailed map.
[245:21.03]No map?
[245:24.83]No map?
[245:26.03]I won't play it.
[245:28.71]That's funny.
[245:30.93]If your game does not have a map, I don't want to play it.
[245:38.58]Alright, maybe a payphone?
[245:52.01]I just need a telephone.
[245:52.87]Any phone.
[245:54.09]Just give me any telephone, please.
[245:55.71]Is there a telephone in the hospital?
[246:01.76]I just need to use somebody's phone.
[246:03.04]Is this locked?
[246:13.59]What time is it?
[246:16.07]Is it 8 o'clock at night?
[246:24.66]In the diner?
[246:25.24]Why is everything closed?
[246:33.38]Blacksmith?
[246:37.25]The restaurant or the bar will have one.
[246:43.59]That person has a knife.
[246:50.13]Get away from me.
[246:51.59]Get away from me!
[246:52.05]Get away from me!
[246:57.73]12 bucks and you leave me alone?
[247:17.13]Did I kill this per- I just killed that person.
[247:21.59]Restart.
[247:22.67]Did I kill him?
[247:35.58]It's alright, it's alright.
[247:37.39]It's okay.
[247:40.31]Didn't you mean to?
[247:59.42]Don't you love games that when you press X, if you have a knife, it goes... You all know.
[248:25.94]Okay, payphone, yes!
[248:27.58]Thank goodness.
[248:44.33]Is this not your number?
[248:52.23]That's not their number.
[249:08.40]How is that not... You don't have any money for the payphone.
[249:11.23]I got robbed.
[249:12.43]Oh my god.
[249:14.15]It's the part of the movie where the main character just goes just hangs up really hard and just I'm sorry but
[249:42.31]I have to take this.
[249:48.08]Here's the plan.

[254:29.82]They work here.
[254:31.22]I think I just have to go there during business hours and go talk to people.
[254:35.11]That's what I'm going to do.
[254:36.53]What time is it?
[254:41.37]It's the middle of the day.

[260:55.86]Not even in my own free time.
[260:59.61]Alright, here we go.
[261:02.07]It's time to figure out what's going on here.

[264:53.01]Why am I...
[264:53.55]What?! !
[264:58.15]I mean, I determine if somebody is a good actor or not.
[265:03.04]If somebody's got a great Columbo, you automatically should get a SAG card.
[265:09.34]You know what I mean?
[265:13.86]If you can do a Columbo, I think you should be able to automatically join SAG.
[265:17.98]You automatically get to join it.

[267:10.46]It's... They definitely did it.
[267:12.76]Well, don't ever say definitely in the middle of an investigation.
[267:15.34]They may have.
[267:16.73]They might have.
[267:20.89]They might have.

[272:23.10]Why would you?
[272:24.52]Okay.
[272:25.72]Okay.
[272:28.18]I... I didn't want to do this, but... Who's this?
[272:38.70]Oh shit.
[272:44.03]I'm jumping on your bed!
[272:45.13]I'm jumping on your bed with my fucking shoes on!
[272:49.82]Fuck both of you!
[272:50.54]Oh, and by the way, I stepped in dog shit earlier.
[273:08.13]My investigation is going smoothly.
[273:12.23]See you tomorrow.
[273:23.38]I didn't even get any prints either.
[273:25.62]But I can't even... I gotta do it the right way.
[273:32.00]I gotta do it the right way.
[273:42.29]Oh, this game is fucking awesome.
[273:43.97]It's just... I already have their prints already.
[273:54.11]I'm going to wait until... There's just no other people that were connected to that scene.
[274:02.88]We have fingerprints.
[274:04.66]It's not either one of their fingerprints.
[274:11.10]I'm going to go to the office.
[274:12.74]Let's go to the office and talk to coworkers.
[274:34.26]Just threw a knife at his head.
[274:42.77]What's that?
[274:43.09]What is that?
[274:43.77]What's this?
[274:45.07]What's this?
[274:45.85]This is quick.
[274:46.41]What do you have in the fridge?
[274:47.17]Quick.
[274:53.10]I can't help myself.
[274:54.08]I really can't.
[274:56.52]Just... I wish food mode existed so I could say, go to the office.
[275:00.24]I can put my hands up.
[275:14.11]pull the fire alarm.
[275:15.97]But won't that cause a huge scene?
[275:25.59]That's going to cause a huge scene.
[275:28.31]Won't everybody know I did that?
[275:29.41]That's right.
[275:32.25]Let's see with that.
[275:32.91]I need to get in there.
[275:33.78]I need to get in there.
[275:46.53]Okay.
[275:46.83]Hi.
[275:47.87]Goodbye.
[275:48.73]Thanks for opening the door.
[275:49.97]Alright.
[275:52.17]I don't want to do this, but I... I mean, I need to get in here.
[275:55.39]So, will this actually work?
[275:57.09]I don't know.
[275:57.55]This is a test.
[275:58.15]It's an experiment.
[276:00.34]You just changed clothes three times.
[276:01.46]How do I turn it off?
[276:16.29]Hey, we need to get in there!
[277:03.96]I... I just need to know if you...
[277:36.02]Let's go to the office.
[277:41.60]What's your problem?
[277:45.88]My problem is that they are hiding something and I don't know what it is, but they both... They're suspects.
[278:02.97]You should be ashamed of yourself.
[278:06.38]I... I... Hold the... I... He left and... Oh, I... Okay, wait.
[278:14.32]No.
[278:16.22]Alright, let's go to the office.
[278:18.96]We'll get some more information.
[278:25.99]What time is it?
[278:27.81]It's 11th... Why is it always 10 o'clock at night?
[278:35.76]What is this?
[278:37.14]It's always 11 o'clock at night.
[278:38.56]It always is.
[278:39.40]Do I just walk around in circles till 11 every time?
[278:42.70]Wait, it's the morning?
[278:43.78]Oh, it's 24 o'clock, right?
[278:50.13]Let's go.
[278:50.53]I'm solving this case, no matter what.
[279:04.44]I just threw somebody's bike in a dumpster.
[279:06.26]That was just... That was completely uncalled for.
[279:18.17]Alright.
[279:19.89]Let's do it again.
[279:20.61]I... It's business hours.
[279:23.39]I can knock on the door.
[279:25.13]Wait, what's going on?
[279:34.18]Wait, what?
[279:36.24]Why am I in here?
[279:42.28]Oh, that's right.
[279:43.44]It looks like an apartment.
[279:44.26]Okay, let's go.
[279:48.74]What's the point of using the elevator?
[279:49.60]It's right here.
[279:53.58]I got massive deja vu.
[279:54.71]Probably because I've been walking up this stairwell 15 times.
[280:00.79]And I've been in this exact spot like 5 times.
[280:10.57]Okay.
[280:11.55]Wait, this is not it.
[280:12.19]It's up even further.
[280:18.05]How far up is this place?
[280:19.67]It's all the way to the 8th floor?
[280:21.47]I couldn't press 8.
[280:28.32]Okay.
[280:29.98]Hello!
[280:31.80]Hello, everybody.
[280:32.72]I am here.
[280:34.68]I'm here to talk about... Uh-oh.
[280:40.20]I'm the health inspector.
[280:42.78]Fuck.
[280:46.76]Uh-oh.
[280:47.46]Can I knock?
[280:53.65]There we go.
[281:10.50]Good evening.
[281:13.96]How much for the door codes?
[281:15.97]Could you provide your fingerprints?
[281:17.73]Okay.
[281:19.17]Um, do you know this person?
[281:22.99]Work with them.
[281:23.95]Okay.
[281:34.51]Wait, that's incredibly important information.
[281:49.35]Suffers from insomnia.
[281:51.05]Checks out.
[281:51.49]Rough Towers, yeah.
[281:57.77]What about this person?
[281:59.28]Do you know this person?
[282:02.58]Rough Towers.
[282:07.16]Could I get fingerprints?
[282:46.59]To succeed, start calling.
[283:54.89]Sparkles in me.
[284:25.76]Alright, cameras are off.
[284:26.76]Database search.
[284:38.79]Shit.

[285:17.72]What's his name?
[285:18.36]What's his name?
[285:22.96]What's his name?
[285:23.48]Got Prince now.
[285:31.56]Type E.
[285:36.89]E. Oh, yep.
[285:39.43]Yep, yep, yep.
[285:43.69]We gotta find E. Uh-oh.
[285:52.02]Where was this?
[285:55.16]Oh.
[285:57.76]Oh, it's not you.
[285:58.90]Never mind.
[286:09.53]I gotta get your prints.
[286:11.33]I feel like they're probably the ones.
[286:16.94]Gotta get your prints.
[286:19.34]It's definitely you.
[286:26.84]I gotta search for every employee.
[286:40.72]M?
[286:41.16]Nope.
[286:50.19]Type H, shit.
[286:53.09]Uh, okay, I need... Did we get these already?
[286:58.29]Oh, type M. Who else?
[287:09.34]I need other employees.
[287:13.44]Um, M?
[287:18.84]Silva?
[287:19.62]What was it?
[287:20.22]Did you say Silva?
[287:32.77]Found her.
[287:33.69]I found her.
[287:34.63]It's you.
[287:50.25]It's the person right here.
[288:07.18]Get out of there.
[288:07.60]Get out.
[288:07.82]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[288:08.56]Well, I'm not.
[288:09.42]What am I, crazy?
[288:11.56]I know who it is.
[288:12.02]You're under arrest.
[288:16.28]In an hour.
[288:23.05]Got it.
[288:23.61]Okay.
[288:24.17]So, I spent the last two hours just being a menace to these two.
[288:32.08]I owe these two a huge apology.
[288:41.11]These two... You know what I'm gonna do?
[288:47.80]I think I'm just gonna tape an envelope with like a like a thousand dollar Best Buy gift card to the door.
[288:54.31]It just says sorry on it.
[288:56.23]You know what I mean?
[288:57.07]I've got to do something.
[289:03.47]I gotta do something.
[289:04.29]Home Depot or something.
[289:08.76]Okay.
[289:10.98]Very interesting.
[289:12.34]We don't know anything about this person really though.
[289:22.46]We just know they work here.
[289:23.36]Okay, I got to show up here between 9 and 17 on Monday through Friday.
[289:32.93]Very important.
[289:39.88]So what does it say?
[289:41.00]Didn't have what it takes.
[289:42.12]Kill to get ahead.
[289:43.06]Then they must earn... Kill to get ahead.
[289:44.86]They must earn my respect.
[289:47.08]What do you do here?
[289:47.92]Okay.
[290:02.66]What about the lipstick?
[290:05.12]What's... What do you...
[290:08.17]I used to be a detective.
[290:08.91]If you need advice, just ask.
[290:10.17]First of all, that's a place of business.
[290:16.30]I would like to ask you for help.
[290:17.70]You're gone.
[290:22.96]Okay.
[290:25.35]What's that guy's name?
[290:28.69]I need to talk to that person.
[290:35.29]Right?
[290:36.53]That person needs to be talked to.
[290:43.01]I don't have very much time for that, but... Oh, there you are.
[290:51.82]Just needed to get changed, I see.
[290:52.84]Okay, what's your name?
[290:54.34]As if I'd tell you.
[290:57.62]Anything unusual?
[290:58.50]Nothing.
[290:59.12]Why did you tell me to talk to you?
[291:02.50]Okay.
[291:13.47]Is there another naked person?
[291:15.89]Why is everybody walking around naked?
[291:18.38]Oh my goodness.
[291:22.88]Everybody has to go to the bathroom at the same time?
[291:29.00]Something very weird is going on right now.
[291:35.16]Why are we all walking down the stairs together?
[291:45.33]Wait, did work just get out?
[291:46.31]What time is it?
[291:50.55]1230?
[291:58.72]I'm wasting a lot of time.
[292:00.58]I solved the murder.
[292:01.24]I just have to go get handcuffs.
[292:07.97]This is not the way out at all.
[292:10.77]And I'm really sorry.
[292:11.73]I thought this was an exit.
[292:34.55]OK.
[292:36.11]Handcuffs.
[292:37.48]Where?
[292:38.06]What am I doing?
[292:43.40]Why do I not have handcuffs already?
[292:51.74]I'm fine.
[292:52.58]I need to eat though.
[293:05.71]Oh, fried chicken.
[293:06.49]That sounds good.
[293:07.45]Let's eat it.
[293:21.90]This place is people just throw their trash on the ground.
[293:30.46]I'm putting it in the trash.
[293:47.75]Alright.
[293:48.99]City Hall, right?
[293:49.67]Okay, arrest the killer.
[293:58.86]Full name.
[294:00.22]We have evidence that places them at the crime scene.
[294:03.86]I don't know where they live.
[294:06.31]And I don't know what the murder weapon was.
[294:09.67]But I at least... I can figure out where they live before I arrest them.
[294:16.27]Yeah, I'll just use directory.
[294:18.82]Okay.
[294:21.06]Locker.
[294:21.68]This is what I need.
[294:22.29]$25.
[294:22.31]I need to go steal stuff.
[294:26.45]I don't even have handcuffs.
[294:52.18]I need money.
[294:59.62]I'll just take it from here.
[295:00.51]Doesn't matter.
[295:22.93]Three lockpicks?
[295:31.76]What the fuck just happened?
[295:35.36]Oh my god.
[295:54.82]Use the plunger?
[295:55.88]I... Can I actually sell stuff or no?
[296:06.97]Poison.
[296:16.42]Go to the pawn shop, you can sell.
[296:48.43]Wait, someone's in there.
[296:51.83]Junk.
[296:56.23]5, 4, 3, 2.
[296:59.51]Taking the beard?
[297:00.09]Uh, let's see what happens.
[297:02.44]I'm curious.
[297:03.28]I have no idea what's going to happen.
[297:08.42]I don't need the handcuffs, but I mean, at least I want the address.
[297:28.94]Wait, wait!
[297:30.18]I could... I'm gonna go to the apartment.
[297:34.17]I got lockpicks.
[297:35.29]The murder weapon might be in there.
[297:36.35]601.
[297:38.03]Let's do that.
[297:41.33]I could probably get the murder weapon right now.
[297:43.37]That should work.
[297:45.22]Let's go.
[298:05.56]After I close this case, we'll do one more, um, we'll do one more fuckface run.
[298:15.98]Alright, sixth floor.
[298:16.86]Let me just go.
[298:29.49]One more what?
[298:42.18]You got this.
[298:49.48]Red door.
[298:51.82]Nobody understands that.
[298:58.54]You've never heard?
[298:59.18]Hold on.
[299:04.85]You guys have never heard anybody get called a fuck face before?
[299:16.23]A fuckface.
[299:16.89]A person with a face that instantly pisses you off.
[299:20.01]Or... Something... Someone stupid or annoying.
[299:23.85]Of course you've heard it before.
[299:24.69]What do you mean?
[299:25.11]What do you mean new viewers?
[299:25.93]What are you talking about?
[299:26.49]You guys have... You guys know?
[299:36.20]Nobody here.

[339:02.23]That wasn't in the tutorial.
[339:05.47]Go to the basement of... I'm so confused right now.
[339:14.45]Why is this game so hard?
[339:16.17]Well, this is sandbox mode.
[339:19.67]I think that's all that exists is sandbox mode of that one mission.
[339:23.56]Look at the camera.
[339:24.22]I have it.
[339:27.14]No, you have to go to the truck.
[339:27.88]Alright, listen.
[339:29.78]This is where I'm supposed to deliver the photo.
[339:31.62]He's not here.
[339:34.36]The Chong building second floor.
[339:35.72]I have to slide the photo underneath.
[339:37.24]I'm just going to go knock on the door and just talk to this person that I'm supposed to be delivering this to.
[339:45.73]I'm gonna be like, can you help me?
[339:47.21]Come on.
[340:08.80]All I have is a phone number.
[340:09.84]And I know that he's bald.
[340:14.98]There's like a hundred, there's like 300 people in this city.
[340:18.44]How am I ever gonna find this person?
[340:28.57]Break into random houses and find their phone book.
[340:33.81]Hmm.
[340:37.93]I mean, how many bald people in the city really are there?
[340:41.35]With green hair?
[340:42.21]I feel like that's not everybody.
[340:57.10]I feel like I just don't have enough info.
[341:01.63]I'm scratching my head to figure out what I'm supposed to do here.
[341:12.01]If that one guy is right, and I can call from the basement with the router box or something, does it matter what building I do it in?
[341:35.69]You're a true detective.
[341:40.32]I'm sorry, if you come to me and say, hey dude, I need to take a picture of somebody.
[341:44.02]Alright, how does it work?
[341:45.62]Who do you want to take a picture of?
[341:46.70]A bald guy with green hair.
[341:51.46]Okay.
[341:53.84]There are 10 billion people on Earth.
[341:56.50]How many of them have green hair?
[341:58.98]I don't know.
[342:02.71]And here's their phone number.
[342:03.72]And by the way, they don't even answer.
[342:05.14]They don't even care.
[342:05.66]They don't like you.
[342:06.10]They're not going to listen to you.
[342:17.47]Balls with green hair.
[342:20.95]Okay.
[342:22.39]This mission doesn't make any sense.
[342:23.93]I want a new one.
[342:25.45]Case closed.
[342:25.87]I don't like that one.
[342:30.24]I want a new one.
[342:44.90]Okay.
[342:48.23]What was I supposed to do?
[342:49.03]The guy, I've got to walk around and find something with green hair?
[342:55.25]And every time I call him, he hangs up on me?
[342:57.27]What was I supposed to do?
[343:06.10]Uh, alright.
[343:06.56]Let me go back to... Where do I want to go?
[343:12.18]Need to ask questions.
[343:14.58]Yeah, but I can't ask questions to anybody that I don't have any info for the person I'm asking a question about.
[343:19.44]If I walk up to this person, I say, hey, have you, uh, do you know this person?
[343:23.44]A blank question mark image.
[343:26.05]It's not going to work.
[343:30.73]Okay.
[343:33.77]Uh, let me go get another mission.
[343:40.05]It's crazy that they... None of this is going to be in your game.
[343:44.55]This whole thing's generated.
[343:48.88]This whole city is generated.
[343:50.78]That's really cool.
[343:53.40]Call from an apartment, then check the building's call logs in the router box.
[343:57.00]I was never... The game never told me that was possible.
[344:00.74]I never got a router call box tutorial.
[344:08.46]Okay.
[344:09.50]Let's go.
[344:11.04]What is this, a library?
[344:16.22]I need another payphone with the job listing.
[344:18.20]Alright, I'm just walking in circles.
[344:22.71]What the fuck am I doing?
[344:24.63]Please, for the love of all that is sacred.
[344:27.95]What's the place called?
[344:28.55]This place, right?
[344:39.00]Press F1 and check...
[344:42.59]Uh, F1 just opens this menu.
[344:43.65]Alright, give me something to do here.
[344:58.51]Let's do it.
[344:59.55]This one sounds awesome.
[345:05.61]I have... Suspect may be armed in danger except at own risk.
[345:08.39]Let's go.
[345:12.53]okay details available upon acceptance alright so I gotta go here and I'm looking for this person I have fingerprints type n shoe size 13.
[345:41.20]Alright, we're looking for a shoe size 13 at this food hall.
[345:52.67]Alright, let's do it.
[345:54.39]I'm ready to go.
[346:02.40]It's right here?
[346:02.98]I have handcuffs, right?
[346:05.60]Yep.
[346:35.33]They're here somewhere.
[346:37.37]Type N. She's size 13.
[346:40.89]Are you going in the front door?
[346:48.49]Gosh.
[346:50.02]I'm a goddamn detective.
[346:51.14]I can go where... I can just open... Wait, no.
[346:53.70]I'm a private investigator.
[346:54.66]Never mind.
[346:55.87]I can't even do that anyways.
[347:04.79]I'm literally a private investigator.
[347:06.93]I'm not even associated with any police office force or anything.
[347:15.60]Alright.
[347:16.68]How big are these shoe prints?
[347:22.18]I just wanna know how big your shoes are.
[347:55.29]There we go.
[347:57.67]Alright, I got... Put this down.
[348:04.62]Shoe size?
[348:06.12]That's an estimate.
[348:15.41]Estimate.
[348:30.67]Hold on.
[348:37.80]How come... I have a question.
[348:40.52]So when I hit inspect... How come I can't... The info... Oh, there we go.
[348:48.42]Okay, right.
[348:48.86]I have to click their name.
[348:51.80]No, not you.
[348:57.63]Unpin this because I don't need it.
[349:09.66]13.
[349:11.62]I think it's Martin.
[349:17.03]Although, that could be up to 15, though.
[349:18.81]So, who knows?
[349:19.41]I'm going to keep you over there for now.
[349:23.79]8 to 10.
[349:37.25]I think it's this guy.
[349:39.26]Martim Vargas.
[349:43.54]I got everybody, right?
[349:44.16]1, 2, 3, 4.
[349:44.86]There's one more I didn't get.
[349:47.12]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[349:49.72]I didn't get you.
[349:53.75]10 to 12?
[349:54.03]It could be.
[349:57.05]I think it's you.
[350:02.43]Let's go ask around.
[350:03.71]See if we can figure anything out.
[350:10.93]It's a... Alright, I forgot I'm not supposed to be in here.
[350:17.59]How am I going to sneak by this?
[350:18.71]Type O.
[350:42.40]Type P. Type Q. Type O. It looks like they have it all.
[350:49.63]They probably put their stickers up here, right?
[350:51.23]Okay, so this is type S. I believe I can connect type S to U. If we can find the type S, we're good.
[351:12.54]That's a reach.
[351:15.96]That's all I can work on right now is reaches.
[351:24.94]Alright, what's the fastest way to get out of here?
[351:28.79]There's a vent over here.
[351:29.79]Is that a door right there?
[351:36.57]No.
[351:37.17]Shit.
[351:48.87]So... I mean, if I... If I can just see him... He might be here.
[351:56.73]Just hanging out somewhere.
[352:04.89]I'll ask around first.
[352:13.80]Hello.
[352:14.38]I have a question for you.
[352:16.78]Do you know this person?
[352:19.52]I saw them at Kobayashi Parade on Monday around 7 o'clock.
[352:25.99]They were nearby Wu Parade.
[352:27.49]Headed east.
[352:30.15]Okay.
[352:31.99]What about you?
[352:36.87]Somewhere around... Yep.
[352:46.00]Why is everybody a snitch?
[352:48.82]Um, I don't know.
[352:50.94]It's a detective game.
[352:57.54]Saw them at Streetside Pavement on Monday.
[352:59.80]Alright, Streetside Pavement around 7.
[353:02.63]What the hell was that?
[353:15.94]Street side pavement.
[353:19.04]Where is this?
[353:24.17]Around 7 o'clock on Monday.
[353:26.31]So that's right around the corner here.
[353:39.56]Did the job listing give you a fingerprint?
[353:42.10]No, I don't think so.
[353:44.88]It did.
[353:46.49]It did.
[353:48.91]Thanks for helping me play the game.
[353:51.65]It did.
[353:53.25]And I scanned a shitload of fingerprints.
[353:58.25]I don't remember.
[353:58.97]Was N one of them?
[354:00.19]Oh my goodness.
[354:08.25]Was N one of them?
[354:10.71]I don't think it was.
[354:13.23]It wasn't.
[354:14.39]I would have remembered N.
[354:19.52]shit well then okay so we're looking for n n is right here
[354:43.59]Okay.
[354:44.21]They're in here right now.
[354:45.60]I'm just going in.
[354:46.60]I'm going in.
[354:47.32]I'm going... They're in here.
[354:48.28]They're in... They're in here.
[354:49.72]I'm going in.
[354:52.73]I'm going in.
[354:53.09]Let's go.
[354:55.21]Three, two, one.
[354:56.79]Hi.
[354:59.19]I would like to...
[355:33.87]Fingerprint N. I would have thought they would be in here.
[355:44.45]They touched the door recently.
[355:45.53]I think that's what that means, right?
[355:57.73]This is boot size 13.
[356:11.16]It's you.
[356:22.42]Can I get your fingerprints?
[356:31.45]I'll give you 50 bucks if you tell me your name.
[356:34.69]Lionel Bourbon.
[356:38.17]Hmm.
[356:40.98]Okay.
[356:41.42]Let's see.
[356:50.65]Final Bourbon.
[356:55.19]Fingerprint, not sure.
[357:15.34]I mean, who else is here?
[357:21.82]I can't even arrest.
[357:26.78]Well, I think it's you.
[357:27.58]I'm going to take pictures of you.
[357:34.67]Shit.
[357:36.41]I need to scan what he touches.
[357:48.99]Just stay still for a second.
[357:50.07]I just need to see if this is you.
[357:54.42]It's right here.
[357:55.46]I can see it.
[357:56.82]It wants to do it.
[358:06.27]Type V. Oh, come on.
[358:15.09]So who's got the 13?
[358:28.88]Is it you?
[358:29.44]I'm shutting this right in their face.
[358:38.31]I think it's... Maybe it is you.
[358:39.71]Let's see if I can talk.
[358:49.49]What's your name?
[358:51.85]Okay.
[358:54.97]Anything unusual now?
[358:58.52]Can I get fingerprints?
[359:01.91]Uh-huh.
[359:15.02]You are under arrest.
[359:38.72]Get away from me.
[359:40.36]Get away from me.
[359:41.22]I'm giving you... What are you holding?
[359:42.80]Are you holding a brick?
[359:55.67]Okay.
[359:57.71]I need to get out of here.
[360:06.63]I did it, right?
[360:20.38]He threw that brick?
[360:26.87]Wait, what is he holding?
[360:28.83]It is like a piece of cinder block.
[360:30.63]Alright, I got it.
[360:43.82]Give me my money.
[360:44.36]I was going to say it had to have been one of the two of them, right?
[360:53.67]This game is great.
[360:54.91]This is really fun.
[360:57.61]So the game's in early access right now.
[360:59.51]I'm very curious how much they add.
[361:02.05]Because this is already very fun.
[361:09.51]Case closed.
[361:10.44]How much is the game?
[361:11.54]I think it's not expensive, I don't think.
[361:14.98]Let me see.
[361:18.18]40?
[361:18.94]30?
[361:18.96]20?
[361:19.90]It's not expensive.
[361:20.52]It's pretty cheap.
[361:27.09]Eat?
[361:27.37]Oh, shit.
[361:27.94]Sorry.
[361:28.12]Was I supposed to take that?
[361:37.68]Really cool.
[361:40.76]Honey seems pretty good.
[361:41.52]Wow.
[361:41.84]Yeah, no, it's great.
[361:44.53]I look forward to what else they add to the game.
[361:46.87]And that's gonna be it.
[361:48.29]That was highly enjoyable.
[361:52.75]Will you play it again?
[361:53.43]I will definitely play this game again.
[361:57.17]I think this is going to be kind of like coin game.
[361:59.52]Where when there's a major update, I'll jump in.
[362:02.36]But this was... This was phenomenal.
[362:04.42]This was really fun.
[362:05.20]This is really funny.
[362:08.02]A lot more of you are going to do way better at this than I ever would.
[362:11.33]But it was great.
[362:13.01]That was fucking awesome.
[362:21.79]Increase maximum health?
[362:24.60]Oh.
[362:27.79]interesting so this is where you ins you go to a clinic okay yeah that was shadows of doubts on steam if you like what you saw definitely go get it uh seems like they're making something really really cool and that's it can you throw the grenade before the stream ends yeah why not sure
[363:08.68]Okay, well, I didn't think it was going to be that much of an explosion.
[363:12.90]I thought I backed up enough.
[363:18.31]I went to a place where there was nobody there, and I'm like, okay.
[363:21.87]It's a lot bigger than I thought it was.
[363:23.67]Holy shit.
[363:27.73]Hey, while I'm in here, do me a favor and install one of these things on me, please.
[363:31.62]Okay.
[363:45.76]Come on, come and get me!
[363:47.54]Come on!
[363:47.84]Oh!
[363:47.90]Alright, it shoots.
[363:49.62]I forgot.
[364:15.00]Why is there a automatic Gatling machine gun in the corner of a hospital?
[364:22.84]That seems a little bizarre, but it's alright.
[364:28.42]Alright guys, thanks for watching.
[364:30.98]The plan is I will see you guys on Saturday.
[364:33.85]We're gonna go Saturday, Sunday.
[364:37.07]It's good to be back.
[364:38.65]I am back to normal.
[364:44.45]Thanks for sticking around.
[364:45.11]I'll see you guys on the weekend, Saturday, Sunday.
[364:51.79]I don't know what we're going to do, but we'll probably do... I have a huge... This was list one out of, I think, 15 games that I want to play.
[365:03.36]This topped the list, though.
[365:13.74]You gonna do Omega Gaming Weekend?
[365:16.90]No, just regular gaming weekend.
[365:19.10]Nothing out of the ordinary.
[365:20.36]Nothing crazy.
[365:28.04]Maybe we'll play Breath of the Wild a little bit.
[365:29.86]Maybe on Sunday.
[365:31.44]I don't know.
[365:34.48]I'm gonna get left so far behind with Tears of the Kingdom.
[365:40.62]Oh shit, this is not even happening.
[365:42.28]There we go.
[365:44.94]There's going to be a lot of names on this list.
[365:48.45]I've been gone for a while.
[365:49.31]A ton of people resubbed when I came back right now.
[365:53.91]Thanks, guys.
[365:55.07]That's a lot of names here.
[365:58.59]That's never... You're never obligated to do that, though.
[366:02.09]So just be aware of that.
[366:03.54]Thank you.
[366:08.62]It's cool to just hang out, too.
[366:14.26]I'll see you Saturday.
[366:16.49]It's also Mother's Day on Sunday.
[366:17.75]That's right.
[366:20.56]Call your mother on Sunday.
[366:23.98]I say that at the end of almost every stream.
[366:25.96]Call your mother on Sunday.
[366:26.82]Oh, I need the music too.
[366:38.98]I thought I set that back up again.
[366:40.24]I guess not.
[366:45.90]Sorcery, that's right.
[366:48.64]We will get a hard date for Sorcery.
[366:54.16]This weekend.
[366:55.14]I'm not going to play it this weekend, but I'll give you a date this weekend.
[366:57.99]Is that good?
[366:58.47]Does that satisfy you?
[367:09.97]Yeah?
[367:10.93]Good.
[367:12.04]We're going to have to do a recap, though.
[367:19.09]For sure.
[367:22.17]Where?
[367:23.37]Where did I put these files?
[367:24.57]What the hell am I doing?
[367:34.62]Where?
[367:35.40]Oh, okay.
[367:35.84]There they are.
[367:42.74]Hey, let's play a song.
[367:48.35]Right at the end too.
[367:49.91]We're going to sit here and listen to it for a minute though.
[368:00.35]Is a battle axe stream just never going to happen?
[368:04.29]That's a good question.
[368:06.31]I still want to.
[368:10.55]There's lots of things I want to do.
[368:22.47]Hope you're doing well and feeling well.
[368:25.51]Appreciate that.
[368:27.96]I've been doing alright.
[368:29.36]I've been doing good.
[368:37.28]That was a lot of fun.
[368:39.60]I got confused on that last mission, but that was a blast.
[368:47.33]Thanks for joining me during that.
[368:49.80]See you soon.
[368:50.18]Take care.
[368:50.44]See you this weekend.
