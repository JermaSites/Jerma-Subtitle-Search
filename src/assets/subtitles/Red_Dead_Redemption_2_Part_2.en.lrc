[00:01.94]Hey, everybody.
[00:02.38]We're going to try a test.
[00:06.44]We're going to try to do it again.
[00:10.20]Who knows if this is going to be functional or not, but I'm willing to give it a try.
[00:16.22]All you can do is try.
[00:17.60]You guys having a good day?
[00:21.56]What is today?
[00:24.40]All track of time has been deleted.
[00:26.26]What is today?
[00:28.26]Thursday.
[00:29.82]November 1st.
[00:35.60]He's... He's... There he is.
[00:37.14]He's back.
[00:38.92]Well, it never really went anywhere.
[00:43.78]But we've... We've had some solid green over the last 24 hours.
[00:51.75]So I figured I would try, because we've been dealing with, obviously Cox has been trying to get infrastructurally these problems fixed.
[01:02.57]And this is the first time in probably two and a half weeks where we've had internet for more than like four hours straight.
[01:09.14]So we're green for the moment.
[01:11.34]Let's see how, this could be 45 minutes or this could be six hours.
[01:14.96]I don't know.
[01:16.80]I'm willing to give it an attempt though.
[01:19.70]And we will update some information about the green screen stream.
[01:25.60]So you're going to have to stick around for that.
[01:26.94]Because there is some updated info.
[01:31.96]Here comes a 30 minute stream.
[01:34.27]Alright, give me one second.
[01:34.87]Be right back.
[02:07.02]Also, funnily enough, I turned on the PS4, because this is obviously Red Dead 2, and I don't know, I think the PS4 must have gone into rest mode, because we're at the same screen I was at, like four and a half days ago.
[02:27.35]Though, we're just here.
[02:30.97]I don't really remember what I was doing, but I know that I exist here.
[02:37.97]I gotta remember the controls, too.
[02:39.63]This is gonna be fucking hard.
[02:44.17]Even the game was waiting.

[06:53.31]Okay.
[06:53.83]Zoom.

[07:12.45]Guys, give me a break.
[07:13.97]Oh, there he is.
[07:14.53]Okay.
[07:15.83]Where is he?
[07:16.09]On the hill?
[07:19.63]Okay, there he is.
[07:23.46]Alright, spotted.
[07:29.60]I gotta move my horse out of here.
[07:30.92]Okay, I set up the detonator.
[07:32.28]I'm gonna explode here.
[07:33.82]Pick up the spool.
[07:34.40]I'm gonna, like, acme this guy.
[07:53.34]You're about to get Wile E. Coyote'd.
[08:01.13]How much slack do we have?
[08:02.01]Alright, here we go.
[08:11.93]Attach it.
[08:14.39]Is attach the thing mini-game or what?
[08:22.36]Okay.
[08:25.03]Alright, now stomp on detonator.
[08:28.79]What if I just jump on this?
[08:36.00]Imagine if it just fucking blew up.
[08:42.46]Alright, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[08:51.39]Put the horse on the tracks.
[08:52.43]I just got this horse.
[08:54.01]Why would I do something like that?
[08:55.03]I just bought the horse.
[08:56.23]Alright, so I have to detonate it.
[08:58.91]So I have to blow up the train.
[09:00.66]Put yourself on the tracks.
[09:02.16]Alright, weapon wheel.
[09:21.47]So now we're looking for the detonator.
[09:34.20]The light?
[09:39.06]Oh.
[09:44.24]I thought I had to throw the fuse.
[09:47.26]It's not radio controlled.
[09:49.45]Gentlemen.
[10:00.31]I don't know.
[10:00.79]I actually don't, because I saw the first part of this mission in story almost four and a half, five days ago.
[10:12.44]Alright!
[10:12.92]That just didn't work!
[10:17.53]Why are we getting off the horses?
[10:24.05]Wait, why would we get off the horse?
[10:28.91]Jump on the train?
[10:30.42]How am I supposed to do that from here?
[10:36.56]Okay, I made it.
[10:41.44]Out running a train.
[10:48.26]Alright, come here, Lenny.
[10:50.16]Pull.
[10:50.44]Pull him.
[10:51.42]Wait.
[10:52.98]Oh.
[10:53.52]Did he fall or did I fall?
[10:56.40]Come on.
[10:56.82]This is what I'm supposed to be doing, right?
[11:00.95]What?
[11:01.65]What am I doing?
[11:02.17]What?
[11:24.27]Okay.
[11:25.81]I think I figured out what I'm supposed to do.
[11:31.39]What's the... Okay.
[11:33.66]Alright, let's go.
[11:34.80]Stop the train.
[11:38.60]There's no TNT barrels here, right?
[11:41.72]Alright, Peter.
[11:47.45]I like the word Peter.
[11:48.11]What is wrong with you boys?
[11:58.44]I was going for a tackle.
[12:00.25]Alright, quick.
[12:02.37]I gotta eat something.
[12:04.91]Give me some cover.
[12:06.33]Oh, wait.
[12:06.55]Wait a minute.
[12:06.95]We gotta go.
[12:11.67]What the fuck?
[12:13.98]I just got hit in the face with a shovel.
[12:16.40]Reverse the grapple.
[12:24.14]Is this Abe Lincoln?
[12:33.15]Alright, give it to the front of the engine car.
[12:37.24]Gotcha.
[12:38.50]Oh, there's more.
[12:55.11]Not right in the face.

[13:03.42]For some reason.
[13:05.36]What's the reload button?
[13:06.56]Still okay?
[13:09.06]Can I get, like, ammo tossed at me?

[16:15.94]If I'm going to hide something, I would hide it inside the lamp.
[16:30.71]You know what I mean?
[16:31.65]Like, underneath the hood of the lamp.
[16:35.63]On receipt of funds, we proceed with phases two and three of the project and present you with a detailed report of our findings within the month, yours respectively.
[16:43.88]Okay, let's see if we can get this open.
[16:46.74]No, that wasn't part of it.
[16:53.02]What's in there?
[16:53.78]Cigars?
[16:54.74]I can't carry any more of this item.

[17:24.74]Not really.
[17:26.18]Sugar imports from the Spanish West Indies.
[17:28.38]Why not?
[17:29.13]A lot of sugar.

[17:56.70]Is it really a lockbox if it's unlocked?
[18:00.32]That's true.
[18:00.74]What did you find?
[18:01.60]These bonds.
[18:04.03]Are they worth anything?
[18:05.49]Oh, sure.
[18:06.73]Bearer bonds.
[18:07.85]I think we can probably sell these pretty easily.
[18:09.37]Oh, wait.
[18:09.53]Is that Ethereum?
[18:10.47]Well done.
[18:12.03]Now, would you get rid of all of this?

[18:16.13]What about them?
[18:17.75]What do you think?
[18:18.91]I don't know.
[18:20.46]What do I do about these three?
[18:22.62]What do I do with my temporary party?
[18:25.64]Guard.
[18:26.02]Deal with the guards.
[18:26.84]Can I pick who I threaten?
[18:48.99]Okay, get on the train.

[19:14.28]What happened?
[19:14.80]Why did that?
[19:15.50]What?
[19:15.74]What's with the boundaries?
[19:19.84]Why are the boundaries here?
[19:25.07]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[19:27.41]Somebody gave 100 bucks.
[19:29.59]Megamoob just gave 100 dollars.
[19:32.87]Thank you so much, dude.
[19:33.59]Haven't been able to watch your stream very much recently, but still love every second of the VODs.
[19:37.06]Hope this helps a little with settling into the new place.
[19:39.72]Thank you.
[19:42.14]Thank you so much, Megamoob.
[19:44.70]Uh, well, you haven't been able to watch very much recently.
[19:46.40]I haven't really been able to stream very much recently, so... Alright, so let's do this the actual way I'm supposed to do it.
[19:56.13]Yep.
[19:58.79]Oh, I don't have... I don't have anything else.
[20:08.20]Well, I want this instead.
[20:09.62]Alright, get on the train.
[20:18.95]I have honor level?
[20:26.33]I told you to get on the train.
[20:27.45]Look, if you follow instructions, you're going to be fine.
[20:33.26]How do I take... I need to go to the engine car?
[20:35.46]What if they run away?
[20:36.78]Am I supposed to leave them back here?
[20:48.00]I don't know if I want to do that.
[20:48.91]No, I'm not going to... These guys listen.
[20:53.03]These guys follow directions.
[20:56.43]Can I climb?
[21:04.78]What?
[21:04.92]What's going on?
[21:08.46]What was that?
[21:10.72]Okay, my horse is fine.
[21:22.15]How do I know that they're going to stay?
[21:23.97]If I'm that guy, I'm just going to walk off the train right now.
[21:26.27]Nowhere to be found.
[21:30.53]They are running.
[21:31.15]What are you talking about?
[21:33.41]They're running.
[21:36.80]No, that... Where?
[21:43.86]No, they're not.
[21:48.18]They're going to remember this.
[21:49.10]That's fine.
[21:50.28]I want them to.
[21:56.05]Person said that it doesn't matter how many people say it Let's get this thing moving Why don't I stay on the train If I'm one of these guys I'm gonna lean out the window and be like sucker I
[22:26.06]I would throw a rock out the window at him.
[22:27.76]What is he going to get?
[22:28.30]You going to catch the train?
[22:34.22]There was a bunch of heavy books in there.
[22:35.61]I'd whip a book at him and try to hit him right in the head as hard as I could.
[22:39.85]I'd probably miss.
[22:43.54]You ever try to throw something as hard as you can at something and you just weigh off?
[22:46.30]That's what happens every time.
[22:58.09]Not very nice.
[22:58.63]I'm an outlaw.
[22:58.97]You want me to tuck him into bed?
[23:13.38]in horseshoe overlook near Valentine.
[23:15.90]We'll be able to hide out there no problem as long as we keep our noses clean.
[23:20.24]Well then let's go.
[23:21.64]Clean noses and everything else.
[23:23.62]Arthur, you're in that one.
[23:25.42]Bring Hosea.
[23:26.63]I know you two like to talk about the good old days and what's gone wrong with old Dutch.
[23:37.85]Tuck him in nice.
[23:38.93]Well, that's a nice icy waterfall.
[23:52.74]I'm glad we're getting to the title screen, song with lyrics, because that's definitely where we are.
[24:16.88]This just sounds like somebody does a karaoke, and they don't know the lyrics to the song for a whole portion, and then she's gonna sing the chorus.
[24:29.19]I don't even know the fucking chorus.
[24:30.49]Wow.
[24:37.12]That sounds pretty good.
[25:16.58]No, it's too easy.
[25:17.76]That's too easy.
[25:19.18]It's too easy to dump them during the song.
[25:23.28]It's too easy.
[25:24.41]Wait, what?
[25:26.61]Oh, I thought the horse went through the Earth.
[25:29.79]Hey, hey, go!
[25:36.79]I thought that the horse went all the way through.
[25:41.70]That was a preemptive, I'm laughing.
[25:43.97]What the fuck?
[25:45.45]How do we lose a wheel?
[25:46.45]So that's supposed to happen.
[25:50.55]See, this is scripted.
[25:51.29]I don't actually have to do this.
[25:52.73]Grr!
[26:12.41]Just saying Okay, lift it up Blank House Flipper again That's all it takes oh, yeah, this is back in like the 11 hundreds, right?
[26:31.83]There's the wheel was just invented Of course, I gonna have technical problems with it Not quite
[26:51.08]Here comes the whole story.
[27:20.19]Back to the wagon.
[27:22.05]You can switch between different radar sizes in the compass by holding that.
[27:33.73]Expand... No, no, no.
[27:36.17]Regular's fine.
[27:39.50]I'll keep it on regular.
[27:40.24]That's fine.
[27:44.57]This is the heartlands we're going to.
[27:46.73]Good farming and grazing country.
[27:48.65]We're just browsing around right now.
[27:50.82]We can take our time here.
[27:54.28]Killed or herded up to the reservations in the middle of nowhere.
[27:59.10]Here we go.
[28:01.32]This is more scenic.
[28:03.18]Kangaroo.
[28:03.88]Kangaroo.
[28:04.30]Get the kangaroo.
[28:05.18]That's a four-legged kangaroo.
[28:11.86]How do I take out my gun?
[28:17.96]I fear I was perhaps trying to simplify something more complicated for the benefit of our block-headed driver here.
[28:24.90]Hey.
[28:28.81]never forget this here's a con man Charles born and bred just because it sounds fancy don't mean he knows a damn stop whipping the horses I'm trying I'm just going regular speed so what happened to your tribe I don't even know if I have one at least not that I can remember
[28:52.12]My father was a colored man.
[28:53.50]Yes, the southern kangaroo neighbor.
[28:55.48]Alright, we just ran a squirrel over.
[28:59.24]When we were forced to move from our lands, the three of us fled.
[29:02.95]You gotta know a family of like four is gonna drive by then.
[29:06.09]They're all gonna turn their heads and go, aww.
[29:08.03]No.
[29:08.31]A couple years later, some soldiers captured my mother.
[29:12.27]Took her somewhere.
[29:13.88]We never saw her again.
[29:16.17]We drifted around.
[29:18.05]He was a very sad man.
[29:19.55]Where closed the property?
[29:22.13]Around 13.
[29:23.65]I just took off on my own.
[29:25.46]That was about the age we found young Arthur here.
[29:27.98]Maybe a little older.
[29:29.62]A wilder delinquent you never did see.
[29:32.44]But he learned fast.
[29:34.74]Not as fast as Marston, apparently.
[29:37.74]Wait.
[29:38.92]I don't understand.
[29:39.74]What's the problem between you two?
[29:42.08]Nice shot.
[29:43.20]Yeah, it's a long story.
[29:47.60]Do a flip with the carriage?
[29:49.64]That depends.
[29:52.99]Are we still heading west in search of fortune and repose in virgin forests as we planned?
[29:59.47]No.
[30:00.29]Are we heading in the correct direction on our desperate escape from the law eastwards down the mountains?
[30:06.39]Yes, I believe so.
[30:08.13]You know this area?
[30:09.65]A little.
[30:10.79]I've been through a couple of times.
[30:13.01]There's a livestock town not too far from here called Valentine.
[30:16.95]Cowboys, outlaws, working girls, power kind of place.
[30:21.74]Driscoll's?
[30:22.70]Probably them too.
[30:23.56]This is boring.
[30:24.44]Hey, we're doing the tutorial, man.
[30:25.56]We're just trying to enjoy the game.
[30:26.80]And this place we're going.
[30:28.88]Wait, what's it called again?
[30:31.06]Horseshoe Overlook.
[30:32.46]I don't think I can even control this.
[30:35.12]I can't go anywhere.
[30:36.04]It's like straight.
[30:36.66]How long do you think Dutch is really going to lie?
[30:40.00]It's just, you know, maybe it's me who's changed, not him.
[30:44.21]But we kept telling him that fairy job didn't feel right.
[30:48.85]You and me had a real lead in Blackwater that could have worked out.
[30:52.25]Maybe.
[30:52.95]It just isn't like Dutch to lose his head like that.
[30:56.33]When do we fight the Wild West orcs?
[30:57.67]Things go wrong sometimes.
[30:59.83]People die.
[31:01.29]It's the way it is.
[31:02.77]What?
[31:03.03]Always has been.
[31:05.17]this isn't like skyrim dutch we've all been in this line of work a long time and we're still here so I figure we must have got it right a hell of a lot more than we got it wrong who's eating working on there anyway just some gyro and ginseng good for the health
[31:31.35]Better than that stuff you buy in the store.
[31:33.63]Yeah.
[31:34.81]You can have all this.
[31:36.77]I'm at the point where I can do it with my eyes closed.
[31:39.49]Don't you just wish sometimes that you could just eat this and be fine?
[31:43.57]Yep.
[31:47.01]Eating sometimes is just a pain in the ass.
[31:48.51]Don't you guys think?
[31:52.91]I mean, I love food.
[31:54.67]But it ain't gonna be annoying.
[31:55.75]It's something you have to do.
[31:56.81]It's like sleeping.
[31:58.41]Think about your entire day.
[32:03.04]60% of your whole day is eating and sleeping.
[32:06.00]Come on, man, like... Where's the science there?
[32:09.64]Let's go.
[32:10.04]Oh boy, this discussion again.
[32:35.16]So just stop eating.
[32:36.18]What's the big deal?
[32:38.84]Who?
[32:38.98]Okay.
[32:39.20]Wait, what does that want me to do?
[32:41.14]Oh, stop the wagon.
[32:42.00]Turn.
[32:42.26]And stop.
[32:43.26]Turn.
[32:44.22]Stop.
[32:44.82]Do I have to back it up?
[33:08.03]Alright, back up.
[33:17.44]Where is he?
[33:21.20]He's right around this rock.
[33:27.11]My telephone's ringing.
[33:29.83]Alright, there he is over here, right?
[33:33.95]Where is he?
[33:35.29]Oh my god, where is he?
[33:42.16]Wasn't he right here?
[33:42.78]Yep.
[33:50.11]Look at the map.
[33:51.23]I mean, yeah, but... Oh, there he is.
[33:53.97]He got stuck in my shit, so he started walking.
[34:00.33]Alright, get on.
[34:03.15]Can I beep?
[34:11.47]run him over no I have to be like at least a decent person alright get on get on where's the beep how do I peep at this guy
[34:38.57]Which way are you taking us?
[34:39.77]This doesn't look right.
[34:46.31]Where is he?
[34:47.86]Did he disappear?
[34:48.74]Alright, we made it.
[35:00.21]Home, sweet home.
[35:01.25]There we are.
[35:02.11]Good thing you made it.
[35:11.75]He made it before we did.
[35:18.89]I've never seen somebody fuck this section up.
[35:22.65]Well, have you ever seen somebody do that whole section in cinematic mode?
[35:26.75]No, you haven't.
[35:29.03]No, you haven't.
[35:31.34]No, you haven't.
[35:32.38]No, you haven't.
[35:32.84]No, you haven't.
[35:35.52]Then Micah got you all excited about that ferry, and here we are.
[35:39.58]We have all made mistakes over the years, Hosea.
[35:43.18]Every last one of us.
[35:45.30]But I kept us together.
[35:47.78]Kept us alive.
[35:49.08]Kept the nooses off our neck.
[35:52.28]I guess I'm just worried.
[35:54.09]I ain't got that long, Dutch.
[35:55.47]I want folks safe before I go.
[35:57.11]Me too.
[35:57.89]And now we are stuck east of the Grizzlies and out of money and a long way from our dream of virgin land in the west.
[36:05.25]I know, my brother, but we are safe.
[36:08.50]We make a bit of money here, then we move again, head out around the west of Uncle Sam.
[36:14.06]That's really hard to do.
[36:15.40]Buy some land.
[36:17.02]I hope so.
[36:19.45]Would you just look around you?
[36:23.53]This world has its consolations.
[36:27.87]Gentlemen, I'm going to head into the local town and, you know, see if I can strike up a little business.
[36:35.42]Of course, Herr Strauss.
[36:37.52]Up for robbing banks to usury?
[36:40.19]Seems more dignified somehow.
[36:43.35]Now, everyone, put your tools down for a moment.
[36:47.15]Come on, gather around.
[36:48.53]Quickly now.
[36:50.39]I know that things have been tough, but we are safe now.
[36:55.33]We are far too poor.
[36:58.65]So it is time for everyone
[37:01.09]to get to work get to work but stay out of trouble remember we are itinerant workers laid off when they shut down our factory to the north now get out there and see what you can find uncle reverend swanson no more passengers it is time for everyone
[37:21.33]To earn their keep.
[37:23.55]There is a town a little way down the track named Valentine.
[37:27.33]Can you play?
[37:27.83]I'm playing the game.
[37:30.89]This is the game.
[37:33.93]We need food.
[37:35.53]Real food.
[37:36.13]That means every day.
[37:37.58]One of you.
[37:38.30]And remember, whatever it is that you find.
[37:40.76]It looks like he's from a different game that somebody created and put him in here like a mod.
[37:46.34]Now be sensible out there.
[37:49.50]Now the girls have your tent ready, Mr. Morgan.
[37:51.56]Come with me.
[37:52.84]So we have a donation box?
[37:54.42]We put you over here.
[37:55.28]I'm sure everything will be fine, Miss Grimshaw.
[37:59.15]It should be.
[37:59.81]Most of your stuff from Blackwater got saved.
[38:01.95]Everything apart from my money.
[38:03.71]Oh, don't remind me.
[38:05.05]Well, we can always make more money.
[38:07.47]We're going to have to.
[38:09.31]Miss Jackson, I've seen shit with more common sense.
[38:12.55]Sleep, shave, or change clothes at your tent.
[38:16.56]I don't know why for a second I thought he was going to burn his clothes.
[38:20.05]I'm done with these.
[38:21.37]I think I'm gonna get rid of them.
[38:27.08]Horseshoe Overlook, chapter two.
[38:29.56]That was chapter one?
[38:30.44]How many chapters are there?
[38:35.81]That's not how you guys change clothes?
[38:40.89]What did they do before... No, never mind.
[38:43.79]That's a stupid thing to say.
[38:45.15]What did they do before laundry?
[38:47.77]They just left their clothes on.
[38:49.92]You rinsed it in a stream.
[39:01.29]His eyes are sparkling once more.
[39:03.53]Funny guy's funny number joke.
[39:07.08]I think we all feel a little happier.
[39:09.36]So this is a few weeks later.
[39:10.64]Spot of black water in that whole mess.
[39:17.08]I think.
[39:18.87]Jose?
[39:25.29]Quite a day.

[39:29.07]There's a bunch of the boys already in Valentine.
[39:31.93]You gotta maintain your course, don't you?
[39:33.75]Half Price Wednesdays.
[39:36.43]Oh, by the way, Half Price is actually what it should be every day because it's like $4 to play one game here.
[39:41.00]Don't come here.
[39:41.68]Thank you.
[39:41.92]And you?
[39:42.48]I'm gonna read a book.

[40:10.16]You can use the shaving kit beside your tent or visit a barbershop to maintain your facial hair.

[40:32.20]Crafted from rare legendary animal parts.
[40:36.66]Permanently decreases the damage the player receives while on horseback by 10%.
[40:40.51]Okay.
[40:41.51]That's interesting.
[40:42.03]You can make little charms.
[40:45.83]178 animals.
[40:48.47]What?
[40:50.49]There were like four in the last game.
[40:53.72]Deer, bear...

[40:58.65]And, like, rabbit, right?
[41:02.52]Six gangs, 30 fish.
[41:05.04]74 pieces of equipment.
[41:05.80]This seems huge.
[41:08.84]Hey, I discovered the deer.
[41:13.50]And the bear.
[41:15.00]Where's the bear?
[41:17.60]How have I not discovered the bear?
[41:19.81]I literally shot him in the face with an arrow.
[41:21.37]Oh, it's because you have to track him.
[41:25.51]Okay.
[41:29.12]Okay, I see.
[41:30.50]Alright.
[41:33.34]Bring Pearson animals to supply the camp.

[50:43.42]How are we doing on our stamina?
[50:47.24]You can command your horse to stay, flee, or follow by focusing on it with the L2 when it's nearby.
[50:53.69]Yes.
[50:56.59]I'm on it currently.
[50:58.03]Alright, so we got G, E, U, or R, S. We're going to go towards G, E.
[51:13.98]Galloping horses cause stamina drain.
[51:15.36]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[51:17.82]173 bullets.

[51:31.84]Sounds good.
[51:42.90]The world has opened up now.
[51:45.80]We're going to the first mission.
[51:56.13]Hold up, hold up, hold up.
[51:56.97]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:57.99]Wait, wait, wait.
[51:58.43]An animal.
[51:58.99]An animal I can take and bring back to the... What is it?
[52:01.87]It's a turkey.
[52:02.93]It's a turkey.
[52:06.45]Study the turkey.
[52:11.11]Where is it?
[52:11.45]There it is.
[52:11.96]Study it.
[52:14.26]Can I talk to them?
[52:15.90]How did you vibrate it over?
[52:17.53]Alright, let's go study them.
[52:39.53]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[52:40.49]Bird meat.
[52:42.03]When you skin or pluck an animal, you take meat from the carcass and you can cook and eat this meat at a campfire.
[52:46.12]We need to take this back.
[52:52.68]Can I, like, throw it at somebody?
[52:55.28]No, that's a gun.
[52:56.87]Alright, we're gonna take this back.
[53:03.73]Alright, there's another one over here.
[53:04.65]Where's the other turkey?
[53:10.08]Pick up and examine?
[53:12.05]So it's a random wild mushroom.
[53:19.57]Parasol mushroom is a health herb.
[53:20.95]It can be eaten to refill your health core or be crafted to as bait.
[53:24.88]What can I eat?
[53:26.40]What do I eat?
[53:26.96]This is dangerous.
[53:31.12]I don't know why.
[53:31.60]I don't think anyone should do this.
[53:34.70]Well, we're fine.
[53:36.00]Okay, give me the other turkey.
[53:38.96]This time, I'm not going to skin this one.
[53:40.56]I'm going to bring this back to... I don't know what his name is.
[53:51.12]Who's that?
[53:56.36]Who's this guy?
[53:56.98]You think I've got a problem?
[54:03.87]He ain't getting eaten by one of these turkeys.
[54:05.15]I'm guaranteeing you that.
[54:17.08]How many turkeys can I put on one horse?
[54:19.10]I'm just messing with you.
[54:22.92]I'm just messing with you, dude.
[54:27.30]Hold on, you can... How do I rob him?
[54:53.84]Oh, no, wait.
[54:54.82]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[55:02.40]No, I didn't... Just stop moving!
[55:10.17]Where's it going?
[55:10.63]G-E?
[55:11.53]That guy.
[55:12.23]Wait, that guy might have something.
[55:15.33]Oh, there's a witness.
[55:18.01]The horse is the witness?
[55:20.23]It's this guy.
[55:24.81]Stop.
[55:25.15]Hands up.
[55:27.07]Get your hands in the air.
[55:28.21]Stop.
[55:28.31]Stop it.
[55:28.47]I don't want to have to do this.
[55:30.33]Stop.
[55:30.69]Stop moving.
[56:00.49]Come on now.
[56:01.05]What do you have?
[56:06.93]Hey.
[56:07.13]Alright, I gotta get rid of this guy.
[56:16.59]Is this like Hitman?
[56:31.24]Do I have to, like, bury him somewhere?
[56:36.16]He's hidden in the trees.
[56:39.32]No more witnesses.
[56:39.86]We're good.
[56:46.45]What was he doing?
[56:47.11]Oh, this way.
[56:47.49]Okay.
[56:51.07]You can't skin a person.
[56:52.33]What are you talking about?
[56:53.05]Wait, we're going this way.
[57:05.03]No, you can't just rob and kill every person!
[57:11.55]There are turkeys over here anyways, and that's what we care about.
[57:13.53]Where'd they go, up here?
[57:21.85]I don't see anybody.
[57:28.13]No, they got away.
[57:28.83]That's okay.
[57:34.09]Study I wait I can study sheep.
[57:36.57]Ooh Hold binoculars while looking at them I don't understand does that work?
[58:04.70]I don't think it worked.
[58:08.28]Go eat them?
[58:09.66]What am I, the big bad wolf?
[58:12.16]Ooh, okay, slow down.
[58:14.20]I'll get in trouble here.
[58:17.84]Animals attached to your horse will decompose.
[58:19.75]Sell them before this happens.
[58:20.75]Oh, shit.
[58:21.53]I need to sell these.
[58:29.47]Study, quick!
[58:30.73]Come here, come here, come here.
[58:31.65]No!
[58:34.31]Got it.
[58:36.64]Okay.
[58:39.62]Alright, let's go.
[58:43.54]That was a shot in the dark completely.
[58:50.83]Made it.
[58:51.13]I don't know how fast I can, like, full sprint over here, though.
[58:55.35]There we go.
[58:55.77]We're good.
[58:57.69]It's the horse.
[58:58.45]Now we're at the general store.
[59:07.40]Oh, I need the turkey.
[59:08.02]Turkeys.
[59:08.52]I need both.
[59:08.98]I need a turkey.
[59:10.47]Okay.
[59:11.53]I got fresh turkeys here.
[59:14.55]And I'm willing to sell it for a moderate price.
[59:16.53]What?
[59:16.69]What?
[59:17.25]I'm trying to sell you a turkey, man.
[59:19.53]You can interact with the shopkeeper by approaching the catalog of...
[59:41.39]What?
[59:43.47]I just got kicked out for bringing a turkey?
[59:49.28]Where's the butcher?
[59:53.36]God damn it.
[59:53.94]Come here.
[59:54.26]Let's go.
[59:54.62]Alright, here we go.
[59:58.84]Hey.
[59:59.78]I gotta... You can interact with the shopkeeper.
[60:02.36]Alright, let's go.
[60:02.98]I'm gonna throw it down on here.
[60:05.20]I got some quality meat here.
[60:12.04]I don't have to walk it over here.
[60:14.08]Okay.
[60:15.92]Sales of turkey meat.
[60:20.16]Salted beef.
[60:20.75]I'm going to keep that.
[60:24.95]Turkey feathers.
[60:27.67]50 cents.
[60:27.87]That's not bad.
[60:28.29]That's pretty good.
[60:32.63]To sell a pelt stored on the back of your horse, take your horse close to the butcher.
[60:35.61]Oh, I've got to get the horse.
[60:37.31]Oh, God.
[60:41.58]Alright, horse cargo.
[60:43.44]What does he got on him?
[60:45.90]Ooh, look at all this stuff.
[60:48.98]I have so much shit here.
[60:51.06]I got two championship belts.
[60:55.01]No, I don't think I can sell any of these.
[60:56.65]Maybe I can.
[60:57.75]Time game?
[61:00.09]I feel like I shouldn't sell these.
[61:01.07]I'm probably going to need them.
[61:04.21]Alright, let's go find Mr. G. Lips indicate optional stranger missions.
[61:09.51]Speak to the stranger.
[61:12.66]Question mark blip.
[61:15.52]Do you see... I don't see one of them.
[61:17.48]Do you see a question mark blip?
[61:24.24]I don't see one.
[61:25.70]Alright, let's just go.
[61:28.18]Let's find this guy.
[61:28.82]I don't think he's in the store.
[61:30.74]Probably down here.
[61:31.48]How do you do clothes?
[61:33.82]Oh, no.
[61:35.38]I guess it is.
[61:36.06]He's in this saloon?
[61:46.46]The psycho in me just wants to like throw a chair in here, but I can't... No.
[61:51.76]Not yet.
[61:52.12]Arthur, come here.
[61:52.84]Come over here.
[61:53.24]I want you to meet our friends.

[61:59.91]Oh, you be quiet, Anastasia.

[62:05.37]Exactly.
[62:05.97]Yes, he's a pussycat.
[62:08.57]Ain't that so, Arthur?
[62:09.97]Whatever you say.
[62:11.70]How much you cost, anyway?
[62:13.06]Well, ain't that a nice way to talk to a lady?
[62:15.86]Oh, I didn't know I was talking to a lady.
[62:18.70]Excuse me.
[62:21.88]Well, I must say, you got a fine way with the women, amigo.
[62:26.33]Yeah, a regular dandy and a charmer.

[62:43.22]This is where it starts.
[62:49.22]This is what you came for.
[62:55.58]This is for me to get my ass kicked.

[63:48.89]What?

[64:01.80]Ooh, didn't even break the table.

[64:07.61]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[64:09.27]Ear grab.
[64:10.47]That's not cool.
[64:31.50]Oh, he's bigger than me No, no, no, no, no, no scripted scripted scripted Everything
[65:02.53]This guy's kicking the shit out of me.
[65:13.41]Uh-oh.
[65:14.95]I'm in trouble.
[65:19.12]Am I missing something from the tutorial five days ago?
[65:22.60]Am I doing something right here?
[65:26.48]I think I'm... You hold the block.
[65:27.90]You can dodge too, can't you?
[65:43.70]Counter-attack, but so you what you hold square and then like left or right right before Remember I did the first half of this tutorial five days ago.
[65:53.91]I haven't turned it on since Pressing the direction
[66:06.60]Shave the goatee?
[66:07.08]No.
[66:07.14]I'm gonna not shower for the rest of the game.
[66:09.29]Can I stay like this forever?
[66:10.75]Can I just be the guy that got slimed the whole game?
[66:31.58]Ah, Javier and Charles.
[66:35.12]I've missed you.
[66:36.80]And Bill, looking as well as can be.
[66:40.43]Gentlemen, always a pleasure.
[66:44.17]You're right.
[66:45.03]We ain't too popular in Blackwater.
[66:47.10]We left a lot of money there.
[66:49.07]I'm gonna get a second here.
[66:50.69]I'm gonna update you guys on the green screen.
[67:11.55]Well, then we're dead men for sure.
[67:13.79]We've been live for about an hour.
[67:14.63]There'll be Pinkertons all over the place, but if he's alive, we've got to try.
[67:18.61]Yeah, of course.
[67:20.43]It's you they want, Dutch.
[67:22.09]Always is.
[67:24.03]Charles, go find out what you can, carefully.
[67:27.43]Josiah, take Javier.
[67:29.61]Arthur, go get yourself cleaned up.
[67:32.31]Join them when you're ready.
[67:34.24]What about me?
[67:37.03]Oh, no, never mind.
[67:51.79]Okay, so let's talk for a second.
[67:55.35]So if you missed the stream, let me just put the camera on because we're here.
[67:59.90]If you missed the stream from three or four days ago or so, my plan was because we were having a bunch of internet problems and we still are.
[68:07.50]It's not completely fixed yet.
[68:09.54]So wait, is this my desynced here?
[68:13.60]It might be.
[68:16.98]Yeah, hold on.
[68:26.40]Let me sync this up.
[68:38.03]Alright.
[68:40.97]Come on out here thing.
[68:42.03]There we go.
[68:44.89]Alright.
[68:45.19]So because the beard's growing, I haven't had time to shave.
[68:54.51]It should be good now.
[68:56.26]But anyways, because of the internet problems, my plan was if we didn't get it back, I was going to desperately try to get the green screen stream done tomorrow.
[69:04.58]But now that they're actually working on the infrastructural problems that were in this area, I think I'll be able to stream now.
[69:13.68]Don't quote me on that, but I did just say it.
[69:17.06]But this has been green here for a while.
[69:18.64]No drop frames.
[69:19.41]It's looking alright for now.
[69:21.75]So the green screen stream, if you don't know what I'm talking about, I'm going to get in front of a green screen for like an hour or two.
[69:27.66]And I'm going to do a bunch of actions that you guys ask for and that we vote on.
[69:32.46]But here's how I'm changing it, though.
[69:34.74]Because I'm including props...
[69:37.56]You know, I'm only going to we're going to set it up probably in a couple of sections like that.
[69:40.88]You'll be voting for props, you know, prop actions.
[69:43.86]You'll be voting for regular actions because every prop action will just win.
[69:49.18]And I'll have to spend like five grand on like two day Amazon stuff.
[69:54.03]So we're definitely we're definitely going to have to split it off into different sections.
[69:57.59]So you have to vote for your favorite one.
[70:01.45]This is such a good idea.
[70:02.39]It's gonna be a lot of fun.
[70:04.23]So we're not doing that, like, tomorrow.
[70:06.29]Because I need some more time to go through and section these off.
[70:08.99]And I'm going to present in the Discord a series of polls.
[70:13.53]We're going to vote on them.
[70:14.95]I'm going to try to get this done from tonight into tomorrow.
[70:19.07]And I'd say by this weekend, you'll have a poll to vote on with three different sections in it.
[70:24.68]And then I'll be streaming periodically, hopefully, if the internet stays fine.
[70:31.24]Expect now that the streams are able to happen from here, we'll push this forward a little bit so maybe people have time to participate.
[70:38.85]and uh we'll get that stream probably going next week like probably like six or seven days from right now uh I have a studio that I'm currently in contact with and working with so it is it's happening we just need some more time to get it prepared because I know I'm gonna need to buy props and that's gonna take at least two days to get that stuff here so hopefully that's a decent update I it's no longer a secret anymore by the way because I need to know what props I have to get
[71:05.72]So the whole secret thing, like, I'm not going to know, that's not happening anymore.
[71:11.14]So I'll be in there browsing and perusing.
[71:13.49]And JabbaDab just gave five more subs.
[71:16.17]Five community subs from JabbaDab.
[71:20.37]Thank you.
[71:21.05]Can't you just paint one of your rooms green?
[71:22.45]Oh, I mean, well, I could, but you have to remember something.
[71:25.61]A green screen studio is like 50 feet up and down.
[71:29.07]If I were to paint a room back here, it would just be like, it would be impossible to do, let's say, me sprinting and sliding into home base.
[71:38.40]I wouldn't be able to do that.
[71:40.24]With an actual studio, I'll be able to do large scale movements, full body, feet, everything.
[71:47.10]It will be keyed out.
[71:49.42]And thank Kazzy101 just gave five community subs here.
[71:52.30]Thank you.
[71:55.06]Here's another one.
[71:58.08]Thank you so much, guys.
[71:59.06]Both of you.
[71:59.72]Five in a row here, five in a row.
[72:03.00]Yeah, so like you'll be able to see full body complete green over like a 40 or 50 foot space.
[72:09.21]It professionally lit.
[72:10.67]It'll be perfect.
[72:13.23]Because you either go hard or go home with this.
[72:15.46]You know what I'm saying?
[72:16.02]Like, I don't want to put, like, just a green screen behind me and, like, do five Fortnite dances.
[72:20.08]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[72:21.04]Like, there's going to be a lot of shit that I'm going to do in front of this camera.
[72:26.44]But regardless, that's kind of the update with that situation.
[72:29.43]We're going to do that probably next week.
[72:31.55]Give some more time to get more suggestions and for me to make some polls.
[72:35.07]And you will hear about it again over the coming couple of days.
[72:38.61]Here we go.
[72:39.43]Okay.
[72:41.36]Back to John Marston.

[85:39.33]How's that any different?

[90:15.72]Thank you for stopping me.
[90:28.78]Alright, down here.
[90:32.32]No, you can't get down that?
[90:34.78]No, he can't.
[90:36.04]Hitch the horse.
[90:38.28]Don't kick me backwards, please.
[90:40.29]You're fine.
[90:40.83]I'm gonna pet him.
[90:44.01]He's fine.
[90:48.25]There's the path I wanna go down, right here.
[90:54.20]Shit!
[91:05.60]He's alright.
[91:12.00]I didn't know that was going to be that far of a drop.
[91:19.62]Special horse reviver.
[91:22.55]Okay, let's go.
[91:24.61]I'm going to just trot for a second.
[91:30.57]Although, can I...

[91:36.63]Do those exist?
[91:37.65]I'm so far away.
[91:38.73]I'm all the way down here.
[91:44.03]Holy shit.
[91:45.45]What the hell was I doing all the way up there?
[92:00.74]Out of options.
[92:01.44]Eat the horse.
[92:03.97]Fast travel?
[92:04.71]Should I fast travel or should I run?
[92:09.19]Feed the horse?
[92:13.08]Jesus Christ.
[92:13.86]Alright, what does horse break?
[92:19.50]Is it, like, square?
[92:20.54]Like, how do you slow down?
[92:21.68]R1, okay.
[92:27.25]I think those are bad guys, by the way.
[92:28.55]Horse is dirty, it doesn't cause us health.
[92:30.01]Brush your horse or ride it through water.
[92:31.29]Here we go.
[92:34.63]I'll clean, alright?
[92:35.51]I'm going to brush him.
[92:36.99]Sorry.
[92:37.29]Pet him.
[92:37.69]He's nicely clean.
[92:38.59]Robbery in progress.

[101:46.67]Uh... I'm gonna have to beat this guy up tied to a tree.
[102:08.77]You see we heard that part so how about you tell the truth that's what you want me to do
[102:29.83]Well, go ahead and carve out his brain.
[102:31.83]Eat his brain.
[102:32.76]And then close your eyes and sleep and see if while you're digesting it you can hear his thoughts.
[102:55.33]That's not a bad idea, I don't think.
[103:06.64]What are we doing here?
[103:07.82]They're not doing this, right?
[103:13.04]Okay, okay, listen.

[104:00.53]Wild West Wonka.
[104:02.63]Alright, throwing knife.
[104:03.37]A small knife with a straight blade designed and balanced so that it can be thrown with ease, can be used to silently take down enemies of range, or used as a melee weapon if required.
[104:10.36]It can be purchased from some less than reputable sellers or save a trip by recollecting the knife after throwing.
[104:16.54]Okay, cool.
[104:21.74]Okay.

[106:05.93]Take this track up through the rocks.
[106:09.99]Yeah, no, no, no.
[106:10.97]The Gene Wilder Willy Wonka was good.
[106:15.23]Williamson, Williamson.
[106:18.17]What, Morgan?
[106:19.39]Just to say, well.
[106:21.03]But Johnny, they're talking like this the whole movie was cut.
[106:22.93]Like, I don't know why.
[106:23.71]Even you can't screw up killing O'Driscoll.
[106:25.51]I like the chewing gum.
[106:26.17]Chewing gum is disgusting.
[106:26.89]Come on.
[106:28.94]Watch that whole movie.
[106:30.28]It's just... I saw your eyes, Morgan.
[106:32.26]You didn't go clever.
[106:33.16]You went soft.
[106:33.60]I'll take it.
[106:59.24]That's how you talk.
[107:03.91]Excuse me, this is how I'm talking right now.
[107:05.45]Do you hear this?
[107:06.53]Does this sound... Do you think I sound like that?
[107:08.41]Are you listening to me right now?
[107:18.10]You sound just like Johnny Depp.
[107:21.02]Alright, speed it up.
[107:40.58]This guy moves a muscle.
[107:41.16]Brain.
[107:41.34]You know what I mean?
[107:42.65]Hot knife through butter, through brain.
[107:44.37]Tell us then.
[108:10.67]How are we like those mongrel dogs?
[108:12.71]Hot brain through butt.
[108:15.21]You're out to survive like them?
[108:17.74]You live rough.
[108:19.26]You live hard.
[108:21.06]Fighting the law.
[108:22.63]Nature.
[108:23.65]You're out for yourself.
[108:26.03]I'm trying to fuck this up.
[108:27.83]Get back up there.
[108:29.67]You're out to survive.
[108:31.55]We're out to live.
[108:33.32]Free.
[108:34.40]Cone's a sneak thief and a killer.
[108:37.22]You're riding too close, man.
[108:38.90]Dutch is more like a teacher.
[108:40.76]From where I've been, you just look the same as all.
[108:44.14]Then you looked, but you ain't seen.
[108:46.64]John, shut that boy up.
[108:49.45]Here we go.
[108:49.99]Shut him up?
[108:50.41]Do I have to, like, road rash this guy?
[108:53.29]We're almost on him.
[108:55.34]Now, who knows if this son of a bitch we got with us is talking true, but if it's what he says it is, and Colmo Driscoll's here, we can end years of fighting, here and now.
[109:10.65]Skid turds?
[109:11.61]What?
[109:11.81]No, no.
[109:12.31]Skid parks.
[109:18.62]Hold R1 and X while moving.
[109:20.98]Why did I go right to that?
[109:22.58]Hold on.
[109:24.24]Wait, wait.
[109:25.46]Hold on.
[109:25.66]There we go.
[109:25.96]So if you hold R1, you can just move around.
[109:27.81]It's a handbrake.
[109:45.21]I wish I had that an hour ago.
[109:46.89]Good thing I unlocked it.
[109:47.93]It's an ambush.
[109:48.71]Look out.
[109:49.23]Oh, no.
[110:08.21]Okay.
[110:09.88]I got my knife out.
[110:10.56]Who am I going to have to throw this at?
[110:12.76]The console is on PS4.
[110:13.58]Okay.
[110:14.04]Off the horses, got the knife.
[110:29.13]First person mode.
[110:29.81]One guy.
[110:30.13]Well, that's interesting, isn't it?
[110:32.47]How do I throw?
[110:59.00]Is this not throwing a knife?
[111:00.46]Hold on.
[111:08.02]Is this not a throwing knife?
[111:10.73]That's by the rope.
[111:20.75]And call Modrisco?
[111:22.15]He'll be holed up in his cabin.
[111:23.56]Stealth mission incoming.
[111:24.74]Who's blind likely is not.
[111:27.22]Over there.
[111:27.64]Someone's coming.
[111:29.56]So, uh, who's gonna tell him we ain't got nothing for the pot?
[111:32.60]We'll meet the fellow that spooked the game, I reckon.
[111:37.64]I'm gonna drain it.
[111:38.74]I'll catch up.
[111:39.62]That's a good idea.
[111:40.50]Alright, so I'm gonna throw a knife in his body's pain.
[111:43.82]So you can tell him yourself.
[111:45.84]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[111:47.98]If anyone's actually gonna shoot the messenger, it'd be that mean son of a bitch.
[111:53.64]Yes, sir.
[111:54.96]Come on, shake it off.
[111:57.02]Okay.
[112:00.44]What are we doing about the pisser, Morgan?
[112:07.65]One by the tree.
[112:25.67]I had to clean off.
[112:34.52]How do you survive?
[112:36.36]How did the guy to the right?
[112:38.52]How do you live through that, man?
[112:39.76]Okay.
[112:48.41]Take the lead, throw a weapon.
[112:50.99]How do I aim this?
[112:51.79]Does it have like a bunch of drop or anything?
[112:55.55]We don't need nothing else from you.
[113:01.27]Throw?
[113:03.53]Now stay here.
[113:05.43]Don't you damn move.
[113:09.89]Time to the camp!
[113:10.83]Look out!
[113:13.38]Yes, and now we're here!

[113:18.12]We move hard!
[113:19.77]Let me start it over.
[113:54.80]I want to do it correct.
[114:02.19]What are we doing?
[114:05.61]Okay.
[114:07.11]One by the tree.
[114:10.29]Alright, so here's what's going to happen.
[114:13.53]Bill, you're going in.
[114:14.85]Okay.

[114:19.11]We're here.
[114:20.77]We don't need nothing else from you.
[114:32.57]Nice work.
[114:33.94]No, I don't want these on.
[114:46.34]I want, like, the regular knife.
[114:50.63]Alright, who's going- what, you going left or right?
[115:03.43]I don't know how to stab somebody in the back.
[115:07.88]Is it R2?
[115:09.04]I haven't done this yet.
[115:11.34]Oh, god damn it.
[115:11.90]I don't know how to do it.
[115:12.52]Got it.
[115:19.99]I was about to greet the guy.
[115:40.02]Why, hello there.
[115:41.30]Stab.

[116:17.65]So we're each going to throw knives at everybody over there.
[116:22.43]Okay.

[116:23.07]Hold on a minute.
[116:23.63]Stay there, John.
[116:28.95]Morgan.
[116:30.39]Stop, stop, stop.
[116:39.95]Should I?
[116:50.55]I warned him.
[116:54.43]Whoops.
[116:58.53]It's on.
[116:59.07]Let's do it.

[136:23.00]That was maybe eight feet.
[136:31.37]This is gonna be like an RPG.
[136:32.66]Anytime I play a turn-based RPG, I'm so bad at managing everybody's health that instead of buying the thing that heals a party member, I just buy like 60 revives.
[136:42.78]Because they come back with full health.
[136:44.08]Just, you know, let them die and bring them back.
[136:59.04]Alright, let's take this scenery in, for God's sakes.
[137:07.64]He wastes... I'm critical with stamina right now.
[137:13.54]Let's see.

[137:24.07]That's alright.
[137:31.31]That I... Eh, canned strawberries, it is.
[137:40.81]I can't use... I can't eat strawberries when I'm on a horse.
[137:43.03]Why?
[137:43.33]That's the horse's stamina.
[137:46.58]Well, then let's feed him, God.
[137:48.40]Come on, man.
[137:50.40]Feed him?
[138:08.75]There he goes.
[138:09.17]He's fine.
[138:11.19]Let's clean him.
[138:14.40]Wait, I can clean him like this?
[138:23.84]I can brush him from here.
[138:25.44]I can study him.
[138:29.64]Oh, I learned about my horse.
[138:34.07]Okay, let's go.
[138:34.73]Not with a saddle on it.
[138:40.10]What is a horse core?
[138:42.68]Uh, that's... I don't know.

[147:07.16]What were you boys doing?
[147:09.12]You were supposed to be scouting ahead for us.
[147:11.98]I kept asking him what we was doing, but he was, you worried too much, kid.
[147:16.82]Just some business.

[147:19.42]You know how he is.
[147:21.20]Yes, I do.
[147:27.73]If I see a rabbit, I gotta shoot it.
[147:29.49]Then we ran into some fellas.
[147:32.43]One of them might canoe, drink some more.
[147:35.03]And this is supposed to be a dry town we're in, too.
[147:37.80]Man, he shoots one of them.

[161:38.93]This is the game.
[161:40.30]You understand?
[161:40.62]Yeah.
[161:45.27]Excuse me, elite Red Dead streamer coming through.
[161:48.64]When did I ever say that?
[161:49.52]Alright, I need tobacco.
[161:55.62]I'll make it.
[162:06.22]I guess I could just fortify it all, right?
[162:14.87]Would you say this game is good or worth buying?
[162:18.55]Uh... Yeah, I would probably say so.
[162:22.19]Because... I mean, I feel like I haven't even scratched the surface.
[162:34.66]I feel like I've gotten maybe like 1.8% through the game.
[162:44.90]What about... I need to fortify... Stamina.
[162:51.80]Potent Bitters.
[162:52.74]So I need Burdock Root.
[162:59.10]Alright, well, whatever.
[162:59.86]I'm just gonna sleep.
[163:03.54]Well, I just picked 20 hours of sleep.
[163:12.42]PC version?
[163:13.10]Yeah, I wouldn't... I wouldn't hold your breath on a PC version anytime soon.
[163:16.86]First one never came out on PC.
[163:21.39]When you gain or lose weight, up or down will be shown in your health board.
[163:26.01]Okay.
[163:26.13]Let's tear camp down.
[163:35.56]Alright.
[163:38.44]So... Where's my horse?
[163:40.22]For Christ's sake.
[163:43.76]Is this Thunder and Lightning?
[163:51.54]When am I going to play with Ster?
[163:52.54]Ster and I are going to play Lethal Weak.
[163:57.55]Eventually here.
[164:00.19]We've had no drop frames at all in about three hours.
[164:02.75]So...
[164:06.40]The reason why, you know, I don't want to be like, oh, hey, man, ready to, like, stream Lethal League?
[164:11.35]It's going to be so much fun.
[164:12.69]Hope you're ready.
[164:13.55]And then the internet turns off in 20 minutes, and it's just like, okay, well, that was a waste of time.
[164:25.17]What's going on here?
[164:31.01]writing down slipped on a rock today moss is slippery be careful back hurts look out for a weapon throwing knives
[165:09.82]How would you even know I was up here?
[165:12.25]Like, let's be honest.
[165:21.56]It's fucking raining right now.
[165:38.44]I don't know if this is a reliable way for me to get down here.
[165:40.06]Do I have to go all the way around?
[165:47.21]I'm stuck here.
[165:57.81]Right here is okay.
[165:59.21]I should be able to slide down this, right?
[166:01.77]It's not that far.
[166:02.33]That's like two feet.
[166:07.52]At least try and mitigate the damage, man.
[166:10.04]Okay, where's my horse down here?
[166:22.25]Oh, someone was on the ground there?
[166:27.53]Pick and examine.
[166:28.49]Pick up.
[166:29.14]Pick and examine what?
[166:33.48]Plant.
[166:37.82]My horse is in town?
[166:38.96]Well, how am I supposed to... Do I have to walk back to town?
[166:42.81]I don't want you down there.
[166:46.45]Okay, hat.
[166:48.71]Pick up the hat.
[166:54.17]Put it on.
[166:55.63]This shouldn't even be my hat.
[166:59.74]Let's steal somebody's horse.
[167:04.30]Alright.
[167:05.28]It's gonna have to happen.
[167:14.47]Herbalist.
[167:16.49]Alright, let's take a look at the map here.
[167:21.17]Reverend Swanson.
[167:24.41]I can run here.
[167:25.32]I'm just gonna walk to Reverend Swanson's.
[167:35.00]Uh, let me take a potion.
[167:41.99]We're good.
[167:44.15]Alright, this way.
[167:51.92]No.
[167:53.58]I forgot it's slippery up here.
[167:59.76]I've unlocked an herbalist challenge.
[168:07.62]He's right here, right?
[168:14.53]Alright.
[168:14.99]Is this guy awake?
[168:17.65]Hello.
[168:18.35]Ain't you done enough?
[168:27.86]That's not the river.
[168:37.68]In this room?
[168:38.28]Reverend?
[168:40.60]Reverend Swanson.
[168:42.68]I've come to meet you.
[168:43.34]Mr. Morgan.
[168:45.25]I took your advice, sir.
[168:46.89]I took your advice.
[168:48.75]Then your God has finally deserted you.
[168:50.93]Who's not without sin?
[168:52.33]I took your advice, sir.
[168:55.02]I have removed myself from Morpheus's embrace.
[168:59.58]No more shall I think, sir.
[169:02.24]I am free.
[169:03.98]I am free.
[169:05.30]You don't seem free, friend.
[169:06.80]You seem drunk.
[169:07.56]Sit down, Reverend.
[169:08.56]We ain't finished.
[169:09.47]You ain't finished?
[169:10.91]Look at him.
[169:11.47]He's finished.
[169:12.13]None of us forced liquor down his throat, friend.
[169:13.99]I just wanted to play.
[169:15.53]Now, firstly, we ain't friends.
[169:17.85]Don't make no mistake on that subject.
[169:19.53]Now, secondly, he can't hardly see, let alone reason.
[169:21.71]Now, reasoning ain't never been one of my strong points, neither.
[169:24.91]But seeing, I do just fine.
[169:27.28]You want to step outside or do a business here?
[169:29.24]I just want them to finish the game.
[169:31.03]Why can't we all just get along?
[169:33.31]These are good men, Arthur.
[169:35.55]They're children of God.
[169:36.69]They're children of God.
[169:38.69]Oh.
[169:41.18]He pans down.
[169:43.88]There's a pool of blood under his head.
[169:45.20]Fair?
[169:47.06]Sure.
[169:47.68]You want a game?
[169:52.63]sure I'll play a few hands we're playing well sit yourself down goldfish I'm luther this is marvin okay fortunate for you both for being gentlemen about this who has the best hand or bluff with a weaker one so
[170:20.39]You two know each other anyway.
[170:22.45]Don't seem like the likeliest of friends, if you don't mind me saying.
[170:25.61]We go a long way back.
[170:28.29]Now you're a shepard?
[170:30.80]I guess it's something like that.
[170:32.90]Can we play?
[170:33.60]Let me raise it a little bit here.
[170:37.60]He can't be no real clergyman.
[170:39.54]He committed about five cardinal sins just in that chair you're sitting in.
[170:43.14]I think he used to be.
[170:45.16]He's...
[170:46.80]Community cards, here comes the flop.
[170:48.40]And then there comes the river.
[170:49.97]Ooh, look at that.
[170:55.73]Can you imagine him at the pulpit?
[170:57.25]Got a pair.
[170:58.31]Queen pair.
[170:58.85]On the forest day, he turned water into whiskey, and I don't remember much after that.
[171:08.10]Here comes the turn, and then we got the river card.
[171:12.06]He's a decent fellow going...
[171:13.76]Ooh, nah, nah, nah, nah.
[171:15.26]What if he has an uh-oh?
[171:15.96]Uh-oh.
[171:16.14]Uh-oh.
[171:16.34]Uh-oh.
[171:45.82]Come on, queen.
[171:47.08]River queen.
[171:48.98]Oh, I win.
[171:50.14]I win it.
[171:50.70]I win $3.
[171:52.12]Game over.
[171:52.60]Two pair.
[171:53.00]I win.
[171:53.20]It always comes down to the river.
[172:13.64]You've unlocked the Gambler Challenge.
[172:15.14]Check your log for more.
[172:16.26]You lucky son of a bitch.
[172:18.86]Are we doing this shit again?
[172:19.66]Alright.
[172:22.42]I'll do one more.
[172:23.02]That was kind of a shitty shuffle, though.
[172:28.90]I will tell you.
[172:32.68]Look at Ace.
[172:33.30]Look at two pocket Aces.
[172:41.29]I better go all in.
[172:45.54]Nah.
[172:47.73]Ah, get out of here.
[172:49.51]Ah, there we go.
[172:51.17]What do we got now?
[173:04.72]You shuffle this time, buddy.
[173:06.66]I must say, you have a lot less stories than your friend did.
[173:10.60]Now, are you lucky or not?
[173:12.57]Have you ever considered that?
[173:15.94]Alright, give me pocket aces.
[173:16.72]What is it, three four?
[173:22.38]Nine queen.
[173:23.06]Okay.
[173:24.86]Huh.
[173:26.74]Mm-mm.
[173:33.67]I reckon all in.
[173:36.21]Damn it.
[173:38.67]Weak.
[173:43.58]Alright, what do we got?
[173:45.74]I had it.
[173:46.69]Well, you should go all in.
[173:47.95]What do we got?
[173:51.77]Now you're talking.
[173:52.91]OK, hold on.
[173:53.53]We got queen.
[173:54.21]Hold on.
[173:55.87]Nice.
[174:01.62]Alright.
[174:12.47]Ah, damn.
[174:13.83]That's the way it goes.
[174:15.89]Excuse me?
[174:16.83]Shut up.
[174:20.09]I didn't lose that much money.
[174:23.57]This has been quite the eventful day.
[174:27.03]Just not the same without a slurring clergyman, is it?
[174:30.69]Queen six?
[174:32.77]No, I'm not going all in.
[174:33.65]I'll go.
[174:39.18]We need the flop to happen here.
[174:48.03]Come on, deal it out.
[174:52.89]Five, four.
[174:53.87]What do we got?
[174:55.65]Six.
[174:57.19]We got four, five, six, seven.
[174:59.68]We need a seven.
[175:02.38]We need seven.
[175:07.46]Come on, man.
[175:11.46]Sometime before we all grow old would be nice.
[175:17.30]Let's be brave, all of you.
[175:20.72]Give us a seven.
[175:21.97]Okay, now.
[175:24.23]Oh, fuck.
[175:24.85]Okay.
[175:25.09]Seems it's us again.
[175:26.83]Close one.
[175:28.05]Give us a seven.
[175:29.55]Straight.
[175:31.39]Do it.
[175:34.34]Nice.
[175:44.47]Rob there for real.
[175:47.49]No, I'm not gonna shoot him.
[175:49.07]I'm gonna come all the way back Nice didn't okay.
[176:02.40]I didn't want to do that.
[176:03.68]Okay, go ahead.
[176:04.12]Okay King Good
[176:13.39]Let's start this low for now 14 Give us a full house Don't do this to me again King
[176:50.76]Yeah, I know.
[176:51.70]Pretty pathetic.
[176:52.44]Ten.
[176:54.74]Ten.
[176:54.94]Ten!
[176:56.66]No.
[176:59.22]Ten.
[177:23.49]Oh, you wanna check that?
[177:26.11]Oh, I'll win.
[177:30.13]No, you fucking lose, buddy.
[177:31.08]Got the ten.
[177:31.98]So we're back in the game now.
[177:34.24]See?
[177:34.60]What do I got for money?
[177:36.18]What are they coming here with?
[177:37.24]I gotta win two more hands, right?
[177:52.68]Now I'm just gonna play it safe, and I'm gonna just win two hands and get the achievement.
[177:58.14]The people we've met at this table, huh, Martin?
[178:00.48]And you win without a straight.
[178:01.98]Hope your friend's still breathing.
[178:03.52]He's very quiet.
[178:04.29]I mean, you can win with a pair, if nobody has anything.
[178:06.93]210 is not... I mean, they could get, like, a pair.
[178:13.91]I give it two pair, though.
[178:17.73]Not just a little wager.
[178:20.04]Okay.
[178:31.26]Well, if somebody has a six, then it's just, I'm folding here.
[178:36.42]That's too dangerous.
[178:40.16]Alright, this is not, this is just, this is, yeah, this is it.
[178:42.60]Come out.
[178:44.40]Jesus, you play like my grandmother.
[178:47.06]One of you guys got a fucking six, the game's over.
[178:50.94]Well, okay, whatever, that was two pair.
[178:53.42]That was two pair, and I shouldn't have folded.
[178:55.39]But, if somebody has a six, we'll see.
[178:57.87]That was two pair?
[178:59.89]What do you got?
[179:03.62]Check.
[179:05.26]Can't check.
[179:06.80]I thought I was going to... Sorry to do this, fellas.
[179:10.17]He got a six, see?
[179:11.55]I would have fucking lost.
[179:12.87]I folded at the right time.
[179:14.03]It was the correct play.
[179:16.06]If you were sitting at the poker table, you would have had to do the same thing.
[179:24.61]Guys, I've made, like, 10 grand playing poker.
[179:30.17]Now, granted, I've also lost 40 grand.
[179:32.91]But I've won 10 grand before.
[179:35.75]What do we got?
[179:44.81]Queen 3.
[179:46.35]Well, I just need to win a couple.
[179:47.43]Come on.
[179:48.91]Alright, well, that's fine.
[179:51.87]That's like, let's fuck him up a little bit here.
[179:53.41]Let's freak him out.
[179:54.61]Is that it?
[179:57.11]Yep.
[180:01.62]Give me, give me a two pair here.
[180:06.88]There's the three.
[180:07.44]That's a pair right there.
[180:09.88]Just need a queen.
[180:15.70]Or another three.
[180:17.62]I know.
[180:17.94]It ain't too exciting.
[180:20.56]Good.
[180:22.65]Just give me a queen or a three, come on.
[180:23.73]Give me three of a kind.
[180:32.03]I don't think I'm gonna win this with a pair of threes.
[180:42.72]Fuck.
[180:47.72]Come on, Riva's gonna be like a three.
[180:49.08]Riva's gonna be a queen or a three.
[180:52.13]He doesn't have his trade.
[180:53.95]Oh, fuck.
[180:54.45]Now maybe he does.
[180:59.79]I could win this with a pair.
[181:01.63]With three.
[181:03.25]He's bluffing.
[181:03.89]This is bullshit.
[181:04.49]84 cents.
[181:04.93]Ace high.
[181:05.47]Pair of threes.
[181:06.75]Pair of sevens.
[181:07.27]God damn it.
[181:22.92]I would have won.
[181:24.51]That would have been it.
[181:25.15]I can come back.
[181:32.25]Just give me a few more minutes.
[181:33.89]Give me another hour or two.
[181:34.71]I can come back.
[181:35.17]I'm just going to run to the ATM.
[181:36.21]I'm just going to get another $400.
[181:51.99]Queen six.
[181:52.43]Why do I have a queen every time?
[181:53.63]Is this rigged?
[181:56.88]Seriously, is this rigged?
[181:58.36]I've had a queen fucking every hand.
[182:10.89]Flip him.
[182:16.75]You okay with that?
[182:23.03]I'm gonna go all in damn it oh come on damn it alright what do we got uh yes that's it come on no oh no better than nothing
[182:49.10]How do I go to the ATM?

[183:05.18]Where is he?
[183:08.20]Excuse me, gentlemen.
[183:11.94]Reverend!
[183:12.40]The tutorial AI never folds.
[183:14.70]Where'd you go?
[183:21.58]Who's the stranger?
[183:24.74]Excuse me, I'm sorry.
[183:25.96]You see a drunken idiot priest wandering about?
[183:35.00]Wait, I wasn't done.
[183:35.88]I wasn't done.
[183:37.35]Hey!
[183:38.63]What are you doing?
[183:42.23]Reverend!
[183:43.77]Over here!
[183:45.01]I'm just screaming for him.
[183:50.94]No!
[183:51.78]God damn it!
[183:53.30]I'm not trying to kill anybody.
[183:56.16]Jesus Christ!
[183:57.10]Get your hands off him now, you son of a bitch.
[184:00.26]What?
[184:00.48]What the hell is your problem?
[184:02.03]He's with me.
[184:06.71]Find him.
[184:11.69]Who is this?
[184:12.21]I'll kill you both.
[184:17.51]Oh my God.
[184:18.25]Killed him.
[184:22.98]What?
[184:26.38]He's still alive.
[185:02.33]He's still alive!
[185:03.45]This guy is a fucking superhuman.
[185:08.09]Oh no!
[185:23.26]Okay.
[185:23.88]Oh, no no no no.
[185:35.49]No, get the sheep out of the way.
[185:38.73]Hey, you.
[185:39.51]Get back here.
[185:42.25]Come here.
[185:42.57]Come here.
[185:47.63]Come here.
[185:49.76]Now what?
[185:50.80]Where's Reverend?
[185:57.50]No live spirit.
[186:03.92]Is he going to the train?
[186:11.81]What is he doing?
[186:14.87]I can't jump that high.
[186:20.07]What the fuck is he doing?
[186:31.97]The train's not coming, we're fine.
[186:47.54]Alright, come here.
[186:48.16]Well, the train's right there.
[186:49.42]Alright, got it.
[186:50.20]What the hell did you do, man?
[187:21.89]What the hell is wrong with you?
[187:25.81]Throwing me off a bridge like that?
[187:27.59]There was a goddamn train, you crazy bastard.
[187:33.06]Have I been bad again, Mr. Morgan?
[187:36.18]I'm sorry.
[187:38.56]I wish I was different.
[187:49.69]Good on you for not doing the cheap YouTuber joke.
[187:52.07]Home.
[187:54.21]That's a wonderful idea.
[187:55.31]I've done enough stupid shit the last three hours.
[187:59.26]Margaret, who's Margaret?
[188:13.73]Yeah, y'all thought of it.
[188:17.09]I told him.

[189:27.77]What the heck?
[189:28.17]What the heck?
[189:34.63]You have to do it for the YouTube joke.
[189:42.42]No, I'm not doing it.
[190:06.27]Told you I wasn't going to do it.
[190:09.92]Just bail in the last second.
[190:15.04]No, no, we can't do that anymore.
[190:16.62]There's way more funny, interesting things to do than, look, I fell off the cliff again.
[190:27.53]You know?
[190:30.76]Wait for the train to go the length of the entire map and then get hit by it.
[190:48.55]Here comes another one.
[190:49.61]He's going without him.
[190:50.85]Hey, hey!
[191:09.94]Is he out cold?
[191:11.26]I think he's knocked out.
[191:12.20]I think it ran over his head.
[191:15.46]He's like, I think he's dead.
[191:20.78]Is he dead?
[191:22.24]No, he isn't.
[191:23.70]Okay.
[191:26.96]He hit a horse.
[191:28.01]Oh, well.
[191:31.69]Oh, he got in an accident.

[191:49.85]Alright, Reverend.
[191:55.21]What do you think?
[192:02.88]Where's it going?
[192:03.46]Where are you going with him?
[192:18.15]Drop him off in bed.
[192:19.01]I really am babysitting this guy, huh?
[192:27.09]Just leave him on the horse.
[192:28.01]Can I put him on the horse and then put the horse in bed?
[192:35.98]No.
[192:36.52]Drop in fire.
[192:37.30]That's not going to happen.
[192:38.60]Drop off cliff, not going to happen.
[192:44.88]You better sleep your way to salvation, my friend.
[192:49.06]What happened?
[192:50.32]Just the usual.
[192:52.50]Poor bastard.

[194:01.76]Which one opened up?
[194:10.24]Five Finger Filet with Lenny.
[194:13.91]Not this shit again.
[194:23.71]I couldn't do this before because it was an Xbox controller, though.
[194:28.91]Hello, Arthur.
[194:29.55]Remember?
[194:31.97]I should be fine.

[194:41.41]You feel lucky.
[194:42.76]Do you?
[194:43.86]Oh, before me?
[194:45.04]At least six generations were born in chains.
[194:47.64]And for the last three years, I've been running from every lawman and bounty hunter west of the Lannahassee River.
[194:53.39]So yeah, I feel lucky.
[194:55.44]I'm the living embodiment of luck.
[194:57.08]That is one way of seeing things.
[194:59.06]But I'm also skilled.
[195:01.10]And in this game, you've got to have luck and skill.
[195:05.60]And stupidity.
[195:06.92]The outlaw's trinity.
[195:08.89]Luck, skill, and just a dose of stupidity.
[195:11.35]Come on.
[195:12.21]You ain't too old and too strong just yet.
[195:15.05]After you.
[195:15.75]As you wish.

[200:24.46]I'm going to pause it.
[200:24.98]Grab a water.
[200:25.32]After this cutscene.

[205:33.23]Back to it.
[205:39.93]So how is, what?
[205:41.78]What are you talking about?
[205:44.20]Yeah, that's probably a good idea.
[205:47.75]I can't even... I... Is it now your main horse, or is it represented as a horse on the radar?
[205:54.06]Welcome back from the store.
[205:55.44]Yeah, it was a really, really quick store run.
[206:16.15]Is that noise in the background your PS4 fan?
[206:17.33]Yep.
[206:17.41]It is.
[206:17.59]This thing is, like, burning up.
[206:19.01]It's not even near the microphone, either.
[206:20.63]It's across the whole thing.
[206:22.83]It's just for some reason.
[206:24.05]It's being picked up.
[206:24.57]Bad.
[206:24.71]You could tell he was sweet on her.
[206:44.61]Vacuum out PS4?
[206:46.56]Oh yeah, this is not- I can't do maintenance on this, I don't own it.
[206:53.90]See, Alex had a PS4 Pro.
[206:54.66]And I had my PS4.
[206:55.12]So we would've had three PS4s.
[206:56.80]Mine sounds like a vacuum when playing this.
[207:11.98]It probably has to do with... I don't know.
[207:13.88]Maybe how hot your room is, or... Yeah, yeah.
[207:15.48]Calm down, calm down, calm down.
[207:17.72]Calm down.
[207:18.48]Calm down.
[207:19.18]Your bonus horses will be available to collect in the stables.
[207:41.63]Alright.

[216:15.71]Hold on.
[216:23.90]Thornbread?
[216:26.02]Okay, here we go.
[216:27.81]Alright, let's get going.
[216:29.77]We've got quite a ride ahead of us.
[216:31.63]Lead the way.
[216:34.49]I don't want this horse to die.
[216:36.49]But I want to test out its speed.
[216:38.32]Zero to sixty?
[216:43.86]Up in the mountains, east of Cumberland Falls.
[216:45.76]This is quick.
[216:46.84]I just hope I can remember how to get there.
[216:49.56]Back into the mountains?
[216:51.42]I sure didn't figure on that.
[216:53.98]But this time, we're doing the chasing.
[216:56.38]I fucking hate the tail.
[216:58.18]Why?
[216:58.52]So how are things with you and John?
[217:01.07]What's wrong with him?
[217:02.11]I mean, it kind of looks like a scorpion tail, but that's fine.
[217:06.13]He ditched us for a goddamn year.
[217:12.11]I've spoken to him many times.
[217:14.16]He knows he did wrong.
[217:16.39]The tail is fine.
[217:17.05]It just looks like there's a snake up its ass.
[217:19.87]If it dies, I'd lose it forever.
[217:21.74]Well, then that's very good reason for me to keep it alive now, isn't it?
[217:48.61]Long hair.
[217:58.75]It's the color, not the braid.
[218:00.25]It's gold!
[218:00.97]Time to go hunting.
[218:17.83]We're gonna go up the... all the way up?
[218:20.49]I'm not in control anymore, am I?
[218:31.02]What's wrong with my golden-tailed red hair?
[218:37.50]Do I prefer flathead screwdrivers or Phillips?
[218:39.86]Well, it depends on what the scenario is.
[218:41.80]We made it!
[218:43.72]Let's loop around the other side.
[218:53.82]You can't have a favorite screwdriver.
[218:55.58]Depends on how big it is.
[218:56.46]Yo, this screwdriver is a Phillips head.
[218:59.01]I can't undo my table without a Phillips head.
[219:01.17]Might as well go get a flat head.
[219:02.83]No.
[219:03.05]I mean, Phillips head definitely is cooler, but... Did I do cinematic?
[219:17.90]Centrist streamer is scared to take a sigh.
[219:21.06]You can probably open a paint can with a flathead.
[219:24.10]You can probably open a paint can with a hammer as well.
[219:26.86]Slow down!
[219:48.64]Well, there they all are.
[219:49.66]I thought we were still in a cutscene.
[219:51.34]Why would they just... I got one.
[220:23.92]Not very smart rabbits, I will say.
[220:26.88]You are correct on that.
[220:32.68]Yep.
[220:33.66]Good job.
[220:34.12]Alright.
[220:36.52]It's getting late.
[220:38.64]That's it?
[220:38.92]I think we should camp here.
[220:40.58]Oh, I thought we were going home.
[220:43.28]That's it.
[220:49.20]Get us set up.
[220:55.73]Just like Monster Hunter, right?
[221:03.36]I've never been in this menu.
[221:09.22]It's just teaching me how to be in the menu.
[221:10.44]You can cook six of this.
[221:12.84]Plain game.
[221:20.65]Let's go.
[221:21.45]Can I burn it?
[221:26.07]So I'm gonna eat a whole rabbit myself?
[221:29.79]I guess I probably could do that.
[221:32.86]I could probably eat a whole rabbit.
[221:56.05]Let's put this one away.
[222:02.31]Rabbits are 30 pounds?
[222:03.63]Are you sure about that?
[222:05.90]No they're not.
[222:12.12]30 pounds is like a medium sized dog.
[222:15.98]A rabbit is like maybe 2 pounds.
[222:26.16]This isn't a Shiba Inu.
[222:27.80]What are they called?
[222:30.50]Shiba Inu.
[222:32.00]A rabbit is, how many pounds is a rabbit?
[222:43.14]Siri, how many pounds is a rabbit?
[222:44.82]How much does a rabbit weigh?
[222:45.85]OK, I found this on the web for the rabbit.
[222:53.83]okay let's see ranging from adult domestic rabbits can have a healthy weight ranging from 2 to 11 pounds two pounds alright well 11 pounds that's huge that's a hair that's not even a rabbit first like to find this monster
[223:25.05]Choose a time to sleep until.
[223:27.47]Sleep until morning.
[223:28.73]He better be worth all this drama.
[223:35.54]11 pound absolute unit rabbit.
[223:44.42]Morning, Arthur.
[223:45.92]Far Cry 5.
[223:46.72]You ready?
[223:48.06]Oh, give me a minute.
[223:49.18]Coffee?
[223:51.77]Sure.
[223:52.13]There you go.
[223:57.03]So.
[223:58.46]What's your plan?
[223:59.40]Well, we'll see if we can track him, but we might need to lay bait to draw him out.
[224:04.64]I want one of those cups.
[224:06.80]Can you get one of those old school tin cups?
[224:09.74]I'll drink out of that every day.
[224:10.90]Shoot from the trees, but I prefer to hunt on the ground.
[224:14.07]More dangerous, but we'll have a much better chance of getting a good shot in.
[224:19.01]And if he bolts, we can start right off after him.
[224:21.85]Why is my author Arthur a Santa?
[224:23.73]Because Halloween was yesterday, and now it's Christmas time.
[224:27.89]tie it up in that rag when you're done I hope you know what you're talking about I grew up in the mountain predator bait it's like the potent predator bait recipe there it is it's Arthur I was virtually weaned on bear meat okay I think I got this done good pack up and we'll get going I gotta shave what's the hold up here
[225:04.58]Okay, let's go.
[225:06.96]So how are we going to take down?
[225:08.10]We're going to bait him?
[225:10.94]This is my horse.
[225:12.00]Okay, yeah, I can always tell.
[225:15.06]Okay.
[225:16.00]How's that horse treating you?
[225:17.72]So far, so good.
[225:19.48]You know, I was in this area with Bessie years ago.
[225:24.82]Really?
[225:25.20]I didn't know that.
[225:27.69]Oops.
[225:28.78]Fix the audio.
[225:31.94]Hold on.
[225:33.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[225:36.10]Is there really, like, an audio syncing problem right now?
[225:38.66]Or am I getting yelled at for no reason?
[225:41.82]You should be hearing, like, dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun, dun-dun.
[225:58.37]Do a test with a gun.
[225:59.21]This is a better test.
[226:01.18]Right when you see the highlight, it should go... It's a half second behind.
[226:13.68]Wasn't it normal in the beginning of the stream?
[226:21.09]The audio is playing first.
[226:29.97]Hold on.
[226:30.15]Let me try this.
[226:34.01]That's weird.
[226:41.17]Tell me if this fixes it.
[226:42.89]Ready?
[226:54.16]Better?
[226:56.12]I wonder why that happened.
[226:57.08]That's weird.
[226:59.72]Because it wasn't doing that in the beginning.
[227:00.92]I don't know why I'm just desyncing after playing for like three or four hours.
[227:04.92]It's weird.
[227:09.45]Okay.
[227:11.85]Let's go.
[227:16.76]Guess you were still young.
[227:17.86]I had my sound off.
[227:19.74]How would you know there was a problem?
[227:23.54]She understood.
[227:24.30]She knew what I was.
[227:26.30]I remember you not being around for a while, but things were looser back then.
[227:31.90]Truth is, there's never really any getting out.
[227:36.09]The audio's at the wrong angle.
[227:37.93]I gotta, like, tilt my audio.
[227:39.39]You know that.
[227:40.39]But Bessie and I made it work.
[227:42.61]Why?
[227:43.09]You thinking about getting out?
[227:45.49]You can braid your horse's tail, yep.
[227:48.99]And you can paint it gold.
[227:50.15]Sounds like Fred from Scooby-Doo.
[227:51.71]Yeah, an old version.
[227:52.39]Is it Fred, uh... What's his name?
[227:53.43]Fred Wilker?
[228:15.92]What's his name there?
[228:22.50]You have entered legendary animal territory.
[228:25.42]Follow clues to track the animal.
[228:26.78]You can find legendary animals throughout the world.
[228:29.00]Alright, we got like a stink bomb here.
[228:37.35]Let's see.
[228:38.17]Okay.
[228:43.17]good let's hope it's him can you there he is there's the trail which way he went this way don't need a much better gun alright now we're down here tracks go into those trees
[229:19.16]Wait, wait, I gotta make sure.
[229:19.96]Do I have... This is not gonna happen here, man.
[229:23.12]Hold on.
[229:23.51]Just wait a second.
[229:24.49]I need the horse.
[229:35.36]Yeah, I need a shotgun or something.
[229:38.48]Double-barreled shotgun.
[229:39.94]Thank you.
[229:44.34]And... What else do I want from you?
[229:50.67]A knife?
[229:51.13]I have the knife.
[229:53.17]Sawed off shotgun.
[229:57.26]I wasted all this money on the saddle.
[230:00.14]Alright, well, whatever.
[230:07.59]Do I have anything else I need?
[230:08.47]Light.
[230:09.65]Alright, I'm gonna bring the light, too.
[230:14.57]Okay.
[230:20.29]Now I'm gonna make sure I have this equipped so I can shoot the bear's face off of his head.
[230:26.27]Let's go.
[230:40.50]Am I crouched?
[230:41.14]Where are those tracks?
[230:45.28]This way, this way, follow me.
[230:48.07]Snip the ground.
[230:50.60]Just drag your tongue against the ground and you'll be able to taste it.
[230:52.88]Clue over here.
[231:02.60]Half-eaten fish.
[231:09.72]Hmm. Hmmmmmmmmm.
[231:20.72]Okay.
[231:25.90]Keep my eyes on it.
[231:27.30]Did I hear a bear?
[231:32.35]Use the safety light.
[231:35.01]Track's dead?
[231:36.95]No, there's another clue.
[231:38.91]Bear isn't close.
[231:43.12]Can I stealth kill the bear?
[232:04.88]Hold on, hold on.
[232:05.56]Which way?
[232:10.06]Dead trail?
[232:10.62]We're going to hear the default bear sound.
[232:16.12]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[232:21.87]The one that goes like this?
[232:22.79]In every single video game.

[232:41.94]Fine by me.
[232:43.44]Let's leave the bag over there.
[232:46.66]By those boulders up ahead looks like a good spot for it.
[233:01.00]That was pretty, that was close.
[233:02.05]That was kind of close.
[233:03.89]I'm not a bear though, so I can't make it completely, you know.
[233:17.57]Okay, so uh, we need the bear bait which is this one Sausages Come on Wait for the bear More or less there's a bad view scar down his face
[233:47.73]Hey, did that bait look okay to you?
[233:50.05]I think so.
[233:50.85]You're the expert.
[233:51.85]Ready with your gun there?
[233:53.29]I'm good.

[234:10.88]Come on.
[234:12.32]We only just said it, Jose.
[234:14.26]I know, but we need to do this right.
[234:28.00]He got it.
[234:28.48]He ate it.
[234:28.96]Here it comes.
[234:34.22]Do it.
[234:35.58]Whoa!
[234:37.10]He didn't do it.
[234:40.66]You alright?
[234:58.05]You're fine, old man.
[234:59.47]Of course I'm fine.
[235:00.69]It's nothing.
[235:05.42]Thank you.
[235:05.86]I think.
[235:08.44]That was fun.
[235:12.12]You know what, Arthur Morgan, I'm a little old.
[235:14.48]He tried to do the bear noise, too.
[235:16.06]That's what he was going for.
[235:17.76]What is it?
[235:19.16]It's a map.
[235:20.46]A man in a bar gave it to me.
[235:22.86]Well, I stole it from him, but that's another story.
[235:25.90]He said it told him where to find some real big animals.
[235:31.18]Thank you.
[235:32.00]It's a pleasure.
[235:33.30]You saved my life, Arthur.
[235:36.83]I think I'm going back to camp to lick my wounds.
[235:41.69]You coming, or are you going to track that monster?
[235:46.07]Well, you coming or not?
[235:49.52]I'm going to track it.
[235:52.48]I'm going to stick around here for a while.
[235:58.00]I'll see you back at camp.
[235:59.89]Yeah!
[236:06.18]I hear him.
[236:07.70]I hear him.
[236:16.06]Where is he?
[236:27.68]Did I shoot the horse?
[236:29.28]I didn't shoot the horse accidentally, right?
[236:32.44]Wait, what am I eating?
[236:33.14]Whoa.
[236:39.41]Alright, I wanna track this thing.
[236:41.79]I'm gonna kill this bear.
[236:48.62]Train.
[236:49.56]Train!
[236:51.30]Train!
[236:52.30]Which way?
[236:54.20]Train!
[236:59.51]Train up here.
[237:00.29]Train!
[237:17.56]What?
[237:19.16]Your horse is agitated by a predator.
[237:22.24]What predator?
[237:25.37]I don't see anything.
[237:47.79]Alright, let's find the bear.
[237:54.70]Don't go that fast!
[237:56.70]Well, I need to open up the... the thing here.
[238:06.93]Because maybe bullets showed on the... Alright, there we go.
[238:09.29]Okay.
[238:11.13]So this is King Bear territory.
[238:16.24]I don't... No, no, no.
[238:17.58]Remove those.
[238:20.18]I just defined them up here.
[238:27.22]So, where's that thing that he gave me?
[238:29.12]I don't see anything.
[238:43.54]Is it in the maps?
[238:49.39]Lure the bear into the train.
[238:52.15]Not a bad strategy.
[238:55.75]Don't walk off the edge here.
[239:07.88]What happened?
[239:08.56]What?
[239:10.42]Did I just get clotheslined?
[239:11.66]It's okay, Whisper.
[239:16.24]It's okay, girl.
[239:18.47]I haven't bought it.
[239:48.35]You're smarter than me, that's for sure.
[239:50.29]How am I supposed to get back up here to get... I want to board the train.
[240:02.00]Okay, come over here.
[240:04.06]Let me feed you an apple.
[240:05.76]Come here.
[240:13.83]Come on.

[240:14.25]Come on, up here.
[240:14.91]Go, go, go, go, go, go.
[240:18.65]See, you're fine.
[240:20.47]Now it's time to feed you.
[240:24.40]Later.
[240:29.04]Alright.
[240:34.44]What do we got here?
[240:36.78]We're kind of all the way up into no man's land.
[240:40.10]What's this?
[240:40.98]That's a bounty.
[240:49.88]Bear.
[240:50.14]I mean, but is that where he is?
[240:51.32]Do I have to go just down here?
[240:54.16]Find the bear.
[240:55.53]I'm gonna try.
[240:56.25]Did I just punch the... I punched the horse in the head.
[241:03.36]I didn't want to punch the horse in the fucking head.
[241:20.76]I, like, lost the scent of the barrel.
[241:22.36]At least we can make it back on a road.
[241:27.26]I'm crying out loud.
[241:30.18]Just go down?
[241:31.17]It's not as easy as you think.
[241:35.33]Look out!
[241:36.25]Back to it, then.
[241:37.81]Get the hell away!
[241:38.61]Relax!
[241:41.91]I'll go to hell.
[241:42.81]Hey!
[241:44.68]Ow!
[242:02.43]I was trying to be a dick and get out of there as fast as possible.
[242:09.79]Go back the way you came up?
[242:12.53]Jesus Christ.
[242:14.32]God.
[242:17.72]Hey, go fuck yourself.
[242:21.74]Turn around.
[242:22.28]He's just eating shit.
[242:27.76]What am I doing?
[242:28.28]I'm going... I'm trying to get down.
[242:33.12]I'm trying to go down.
[242:34.24]Alright.
[242:45.27]Where was it up here?
[242:47.29]Like here?
[242:49.03]Oh, they're down.
[242:51.21]Guys, I'm in the middle of the mountains.
[242:53.85]I gotta go around the whole mountain to get out of here.
[242:55.83]Alright, we're gonna play hot and cold.
[242:58.75]You ready?
[243:01.33]Starting now.
[243:15.70]Ice cold.
[243:16.20]Warmer.
[243:16.92]Getting lukewarm.
[243:24.62]Cold.
[243:25.18]Cold.
[243:26.86]Hot.
[243:27.26]Warm.
[243:27.70]Hot.
[243:28.12]Hot.
[243:28.34]Hot.
[243:28.52]Hot.
[243:28.66]Hot.
[243:28.80]Hot.
[243:29.08]Hot.
[243:29.48]Hot.
[243:30.16]Okay, hold on.
[243:47.96]I'm on fire.
[243:49.91]On fire.
[243:51.75]This is where... That's where I'm going.
[243:54.59]This is where I'm heading right now.
[243:56.55]That's where I'm going right now.
[244:00.49]What?
[244:00.97]That's where I'm... That's where the waypoint is.
[244:05.91]The... What?
[244:09.14]Feels like the days is getting longer.
[244:17.33]Yeah, I got away with that one.
[244:28.22]Just press O near the horse's head?
[244:30.26]I don't understand.
[244:45.53]Hey!
[244:46.49]No!
[244:47.31]No!
[244:51.90]Wait, I'm sorry!
[244:58.04]I don't know why, I don't understand.
[245:00.18]I just, somebody told me to do that.
[245:05.50]I'm now cold.
[245:06.46]Well, you're cold.
[245:07.12]I'm not.
[245:09.38]Oh, no, no, that's just a chat thing.
[245:10.83]That's not, I'm hot right now with chat.
[245:29.98]No, please!
[245:30.86]I could've just been a crazy person.
[245:54.81]Where the fuck am I now?
[245:55.71]What if... This is not the beginning of... Wait, hold on.
[246:02.52]No, no, no.
[246:03.04]Wait, is this the beginning before... No, my horse is right here.
[246:06.20]Thank God.
[246:06.82]Oh, you can tell by the tail.
[246:13.95]I made it.
[246:16.05]It's right here.
[246:23.42]Jesus fucking Christ.
[246:26.08]Pay attention.
[246:27.69]I swear to God.
[246:34.61]Okay, you have to avoid the rocks.
[246:38.48]This game, I like this game.
[246:40.40]This is a fun game.
[246:44.14]Slow down.
[246:46.54]This is where I put it on, okay?
[246:51.20]I wanted to backhand punch that guy in the ear and fly him off the cliff so bad.
[246:57.61]Words can't even describe how badly I wanted to do that.
[247:10.24]I was holding X. Honest to God.
[247:13.46]I was holding X. It's supposed to keep you at a steady pace on the mountain.
[247:19.07]Right?
[247:19.71]Holding X keeps you on the road.
[247:21.03]Get away from me.
[247:41.31]That's only if it's in a cinematic.
[247:43.01]Oh, for the love of God.
[247:46.83]Well then, fine.
[247:47.75]Fuck it.
[247:50.07]Let's do it.
[247:50.73]Cinematic mode.
[247:51.59]Now I can, like, actually drive around on the roads.
[247:53.62]Okay.
[248:06.26]I think I'm getting close.
[248:09.43]You can ride as fast as you want in cinematic mode.
[248:11.85]No, I don't believe that.
[248:17.12]Where are we at now?
[248:18.10]Getting close.
[248:20.26]I remember this.
[248:22.78]Slow down.
[248:32.21]Everything's fine.
[248:34.73]You actually can.
[248:37.28]Should I believe people in chat, or should I just play the game?
[248:49.19]Holy shit, they weren't lying.
[248:53.83]Okay.
[248:57.09]Alright.
[248:59.59]So, thanks guys.
[249:02.08]Alright, almost there.
[249:03.80]How much further down do we have to go?
[249:11.65]I don't know what to think about that tail.
[249:20.93]I got, I'm reading, reading chat.
[249:25.42]That time.

[249:54.99]You guys thought I could just run up the mountain?
[250:00.01]That's not gonna happen?
[250:03.23]I need to heal a little bit here.
[250:10.37]You know what I'm saying?
[250:12.55]Get away from me.
[250:13.09]What?
[250:18.44]What was that?
[250:21.61]Somebody was just screaming.
[250:30.65]I don't see anyone.
[250:38.96]Oh, hey, what is that thing?

[251:08.79]What do I do?
[251:52.00]Everyone asked me.
[251:52.54]I knew he was dead.
[251:54.22]In my head, I internalized, like, the... And that I wanted to make sure it was quick.
[252:03.08]You know, like, I don't want him to, you know, be suffering there.
[252:07.18]To me, like, I did that very quickly.
[252:14.86]It was like... Done.
[252:22.86]Yeah, he got some wolf meat.
[252:23.66]What did he have on him?
[252:30.41]Oh, what?
[252:33.65]Did I just sever his leg with that?
[252:39.15]What do you got?
[252:40.33]I have a bait.
[252:42.30]Good rabbit pelt.
[254:01.12]Just in case his brain stem was still transmitting data.
[254:03.64]You know, what if he wasn't dead completely?
[254:06.74]Burial scene.
[254:07.58]You know, I don't want him to be suffering in there.
[254:22.42]You missed his brain?
[254:23.80]How do you miss somebody's brain if their head is gone?
[254:27.36]Legendary animal territory.
[254:28.44]Here we go.
[254:30.82]I'm ready.
[254:31.14]Give him hay?
[254:43.69]Can I give him an apple?
[254:45.45]Something else too, like an apple.
[254:48.41]No, I don't want to give him any more baklava.
[254:49.93]Give him a fucking apple.
[254:54.28]There, classic oat cake.
[254:55.50]Classic oat cakes.
[255:04.04]Okay.

[255:40.08]What's this shit?
[255:42.24]Oh.
[255:42.74]Just eat it.
[255:48.80]Actually, I need to take a potion or something here.
[255:51.58]Yeah.
[255:51.88]Look at my health.
[255:52.58]It sucks.
[255:53.06]I could eat, like, beans and shit.
[255:58.36]My core is terrible.
[256:03.63]Alright, we're good.
[256:05.13]Move my Deadeye.
[256:05.73]My Deadeye sucks too.
[256:11.23]Slightly damages the Deadeye core.
[256:13.08]Who gives a shit?
[256:14.88]Alright, I'm ready.
[256:22.66]Not quite any clues yet.
[256:23.88]Do I have any bait?
[256:27.02]I don't think I have any bait, do I?
[256:30.27]Can I make any?
[256:32.84]Hold on, can I make bait here?
[256:40.48]This is where he h- this is his hangout here.
[256:42.12]I have herbivore bait.
[256:53.01]I don't see any clues of him being right here anywhere.
[257:10.02]Come on.
[257:10.32]If I was a bear, where would I be?
[257:13.65]Right here somewhere?
[257:14.27]I need to make Master Ba-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a-a.
[257:23.15]And that's how we sing the song.
[257:31.14]The thing that we're singing right now.
[257:32.58]Okay, let's go.
[257:37.01]I don't see any tracks or anything.
[257:38.77]There's no point of interest on the smell?
[257:45.91]Let me actually see if I have... I don't think I do.
[257:50.15]Herbivore bait.
[257:51.39]Predator bait.
[257:51.95]Okay.
[257:57.46]So now... Can I just put it down here?
[258:08.18]The horse hat kind of has to get out of the way.
[258:09.36]Move out of the way.
[258:28.08]Bear?
[258:29.70]No.
[258:32.48]What's that sound?
[258:54.30]I gotta go further back?
[259:08.67]I thought the shadow was the bear's shadow behind me.
[259:12.46]Standing up.
[259:16.48]Alright, I gotta get the ports out of here.
[259:19.12]Let me get that bait, actually.
[259:23.93]We'll see, uh, it's flee, right?
[259:25.95]Flee me is, that means he's gonna go back to town, right?
[259:33.25]When I press, flee!
[259:38.07]Or does that mean, hey, go free?
[259:43.38]Like, how do I make him go home?
[259:46.88]Hold on, come here.
[259:58.00]Come on.
[260:07.22]Alright, stay there.
[260:12.69]Stay over there.
[260:13.23]At least pick the bait back up.
[260:20.78]Where is the bait?
[260:21.62]It's like right here, right?
[260:29.65]Didn't I just drop it, like, right here?
[260:35.92]What are these stink lines?
[260:37.16]Is this me?
[260:37.84]Oh, that's my body.
[260:42.98]Alright, I'm going back down here.
[260:55.73]Let's go right to the X. I'm gonna drop it right here.
[261:01.04]So am I pushing the bear away by smelling strongly?
[261:03.76]I mean, right here.
[261:14.23]I'm gonna put some bait right here.
[261:20.11]Or would that be a stupid idea?
[261:21.51]There's a clue?
[261:30.31]I don't see... I mean, this is not a clue.
[261:32.39]This is just flowers on the ground.
[261:44.44]I don't see shit.
[261:50.68]The bear is scared away.
[261:53.83]So I can't get him to spawn again.
[261:55.23]I can just come back later.
[262:00.24]There's activity in the area, so the bear won't spawn.
[262:12.08]Oh, ginseng.
[262:19.42]What is going on over here?
[262:20.32]Ooh, what's this?
[262:22.87]I think that's the elk.
[262:24.13]It was just right here, right?
[262:27.45]Yes, deer tracks.
[262:29.99]Yeah, I'll come back later.
[262:33.27]Let's go do another mission.
[262:37.01]In fact, where am I going to go from here?
[262:41.16]Oh my lord.
[262:42.56]I'm so far away from everything.
[262:45.98]Oh.
[262:49.36]How do I... How do I get over here faster?
[262:51.58]Uh...
[263:03.65]I gotta go across the whole world.

[288:16.90]What's the point of the rear?
[288:19.30]That's a good question.
[288:21.26]I'm actually not sure.

[288:30.73]What am I tracking?
[288:46.53]Unknown animal.
[288:52.75]Unknown animal.
[288:55.27]Interesting.
[289:02.79]So am I going this way?
[289:11.80]I guess we're going this way.
[289:18.90]Still on the right path, right?
[289:19.88]Yeah.
[289:29.29]Is that it right there?
[289:31.47]That's the animal?
[289:33.91]What is this thing?
[289:34.63]Is it a bug?
[289:36.55]Oh, it's a rat!
[289:49.32]It's a rat.
[289:50.09]Okay.
[289:51.47]Well, cool.
[289:55.49]Somebody else died here.
[289:56.43]Let's study the rat.
[290:04.10]I didn't kill this lady.
[290:08.16]Okay.
[290:12.42]Pick up strip.
[290:14.88]Who died?
[290:15.30]How did you guys die out here?
[290:20.64]I didn't, like, kill these people, did I?
[290:21.78]I mean, there's no loot option.
[290:30.01]You got anything in the buggy?
[290:34.99]No?
[290:35.43]Okay, well, I found a rat.
[290:41.56]People die, Jeremy.
[290:43.12]Well, yeah, but there has to be a cause somewhere.
[290:49.78]What is this woman doing here?
[290:53.72]My control is vibrating right now.
[290:58.66]I'm not sure why.
[291:07.99]Follow the rat.
[291:10.73]Focus on the rat.
[291:11.57]Why am I focusing on the rat track?
[291:16.35]I'm trying to catch a fucking rat in the field.
[291:18.81]And this bandit's about to come stop and yell at me.
[291:22.79]Alright, I'm just trying to catch a rat out here.
[291:24.63]Where'd he go?
[291:46.98]There's so many trails now.
[291:48.62]There he is.
[291:53.64]There, I caught the rat.
[291:54.40]I'm just going to put him in my pocket.
[292:07.50]Okay, there's another animal over here.
[292:17.07]Oh, is that my animal?
[292:20.80]I dropped a few frames.
[292:22.62]Well, we've been going for about five hours now.
[292:25.30]I'm actually happy with how stable it has been.
[292:28.34]I can keep going.
[292:40.80]Does Motor investigate at the body?
[292:42.26]What is there?
[292:51.88]These people here.
[293:00.80]The first one.
[293:11.63]No, the dead guy.
[293:12.39]Everyone over here is dead.
[293:14.49]They're all dead guys.
[293:15.35]Oh, I can inspect that.
[293:27.77]Am I doing?
[293:28.27]Am I painting this?
[293:34.02]Chapter.
[293:34.60]Shogang Savings.
[293:36.58]Creeping Time.
[293:37.22]Alaskan Ginseng.
[293:43.87]Why did I want to draw this?
[294:02.15]Dinosaur bone.
[294:03.53]Okay.
[294:12.42]That's pretty crazy.
[294:13.18]Your Deadeye bar has increased.
[294:14.24]Trick shots, hunting, grafting, and other survivalist-related activities.
[294:21.12]You found a dinosaur bone.
[294:22.04]Look out for more of these on your travels.
[294:23.96]They might be of use to you at some point.
[294:25.82]1 of 30.
[294:25.92]That's pretty sick.
[294:35.70]I could loot something here.
[294:38.68]It was on the other side.
[294:43.74]What could I loot?
[294:44.58]There it is.
[294:45.60]This guy.
[294:50.76]Letter from Cornwall.
[294:52.57]Inspect the document.
[294:57.21]Very regrettable that you have rejected the various extremely generous purchase offers presented to you by Cornwall.
[295:03.22]I'd be very concerned about a company of your size being able to continue to compete on a price of the state of New Hanover to secure acceptable rates for railroad transportation.
[295:12.11]So they killed him.
[295:14.91]That's unfortunate.
[295:17.95]That's not cool.
[295:26.27]That's the guy that I robbed?
[295:27.93]What?
[295:29.37]That's not a guy I robbed.
[295:36.91]Three horses, huh?
[295:42.37]Which one is fast?
[295:45.85]He robbed his train.
[295:47.25]Oh, okay.
[295:54.10]Did he find the unknown animal?
[295:55.26]Yeah, it was a rat.
[295:56.88]It was really nothing spectacular.
[296:01.60]Identify yourself.
[296:03.88]Arthur coming in.
[296:05.93]Will they just shoot you?
[296:08.27]Oh, look.
[296:08.59]Look who it is.
[296:09.05]I ain't even gonna ask where you've been.
[296:11.03]How you feeling?
[296:15.85]Hi, John.
[296:16.47]Well, glad you're on the mound.
[296:18.57]Sounds good.
[296:27.62]Alright.
[296:37.15]Crafting fire near the edge of camp.
[296:38.52]We've got Uncle.
[296:39.96]$122 camp funds.
[296:47.13]Dad?
[296:47.43]Dad?
[297:16.83]Alright, put your... Oh, wait, but this Reverend... Have I not figured this shit out yet?
[297:25.28]I need to go to the medicine wagon.
[297:27.36]Perfect, perfect, perfect.
[297:28.16]Oh, okay.
[297:28.54]Two perfect pronghorns.
[297:53.20]Do it.
[297:55.00]Wrap it.
[297:55.60]Don't eat the funds.
[298:01.25]Yeah, just take it.
[298:05.43]Rat meat.
[298:09.13]So this is the little casino table that's opened up here.
[298:13.41]Poker.
[298:13.75]So...
[298:18.52]Contribute.
[298:19.08]No.
[298:19.30]I need money.
[298:20.60]I need to go on a heist or something.
[298:22.38]Let's go to Uncle.
[298:24.94]I do still only have 79 cents.
[298:26.10]I'm not gonna gamble with my last 79 cents.
[298:28.42]Over here.
[298:28.64]Somebody over here?
[298:29.38]Oh.
[298:50.21]Hello, uncle.
[298:53.64]Careful not to work yourself to death there, uncle.
[298:56.06]I was thinking.
[298:57.20]Does it pay well?
[298:59.36]Eventually.
[299:00.74]So, while the rest of us are busy stealing, killing, fighting each other to survive, you get to think all day.
[299:09.57]Are you serious?
[299:10.21]It's a strange world we live in, Arthur Morgan.
[299:13.22]You wanna head into town?
[299:14.82]See if we can find anything else.
[299:16.36]Sure.
[299:17.14]I got some errands to run.
[299:18.29]Great.
[299:18.99]Go check the horses are ready.
[299:24.75]If you're gonna take the old man into town, you can take us too.
[299:28.67]Hydrant, I got a water right here.
[299:30.49]Was I just fucking off for the past four hours?
[299:32.37]I don't know, I mean, I was doing missions.
[299:34.27]I was going places, I was doing things, I was...
[299:56.81]Let's have some fun
[300:33.22]Pied them all off a cliff.
[300:38.95]Almost just caused a wreck right there.
[300:40.65]It was close.
[300:44.55]The lady just got whipped.
[300:46.51]Right in the face.
[300:47.23]Letting the top left.
[300:48.45]Oh, shut up.
[301:03.62]I don't want to hear this anymore.
[301:05.83]Slow down.
[301:06.47]Oh, no.
[301:07.05]His coach broke down.
[301:08.75]So, do I...
[301:31.88]Alright, I'll see what's going on.
[301:34.60]Down the class.
[301:37.69]Go on.

[301:40.75]Lumbago, really?
[301:44.49]You alright there, friend?
[301:46.38]Hello.

[301:54.87]You gonna give me money?
[301:56.61]I might make some money here.
[301:57.67]That'd be good.

[303:16.24]Well, I just... I want to look at it.
[303:21.03]You don't have to look at it.
[303:27.45]So I did a good thing, see?
[303:44.07]Everybody thought all I do is bad things.
[303:45.77]I just like to shoot people, throw people off cliffs and everything.
[303:48.49]That was a good deed.
[303:51.69]A small one, perhaps, hidden deep inside, but a real one?
[303:55.52]And you have it, your post-mode blizzard.
[303:58.08]Blizzards have hearts.
[303:59.52]Well, Arthur, I'm proud of you.

[304:46.85]Oh, my stomach.

[305:01.43]I don't know, man.
[305:04.17]I went a little too far, and then I was holding R1, and it tipped over at the last possible second.
[305:11.05]And I- I didn't- I- and I have to say- help that guy again.

[310:49.87]To Valentine's.
[310:52.93]You're turning into a regular old fairy godmother there, Arthur.
[310:56.09]What was I supposed to make?
[310:57.73]That means you got a heart.
[310:59.31]A small one, perhaps, hidden deep inside, but a real heart?
[311:02.13]Forget about the fucking train.
[311:03.11]And you haven't, you're a pulse of old lizard.
[311:04.77]Hit the guy off the train.
[311:06.02]I'm not going to hit a guy off the fucking train.
[311:07.74]Well, Arthur, I'm proud of you.
[311:09.34]To be honest, if you lot hadn't been here, I probably would have robbed him.

[313:19.73]Is there a blue?
[313:20.71]No, that was better.
[313:22.52]I'm not going to ask why.
[313:23.94]This feels more Western, doesn't it?
[313:25.82]You are a sad man, Arthur Morgan.
[313:28.68]But I know you love me.
[313:30.74]Desperately.

[317:20.75]Train full of rich tourists heading to Saint-Denis and then cruising off to Brazil.
[317:26.67]A train laden with baggage and passing through a bit of deserted country at night.
[317:32.92]Asked to get to the docks in time for the tides.
[317:35.06]In some place called Scarlet Meadows.
[317:37.00]Scarlet Meadows.
[317:37.52]That is shaved.
[317:39.00]Not here, like in the game.
[317:39.86]Well, here too, but... Sprint.
[318:10.99]It's a dance night for all I care.
[318:12.65]Get off me.
[318:13.35]Get off of me.
[318:15.33]I've been looking too long.
[318:19.25]Get in.
[318:19.59]Get your hands off her, friend.
[318:21.90]Who are you?
[318:22.74]A friend of mine.
[318:23.94]Get off her.
[318:24.70]Or what exactly?
[318:31.86]You want to find out?
[318:37.48]You're making a big mistake, Tilly Jackson.
[318:40.72]Just get lost.
[318:42.93]I ain't doing this with you right now.
[318:44.57]Go away with Uncle and Mary Beth.
[318:46.19]They're across the street.
[318:47.91]Good kid.
[318:53.78]How did I fail that?
[319:05.14]That was a... I sucker punched him?
[319:08.90]He was being a bad guy, so I wanted to push the bad guy over.
[319:18.76]Get your hands off of her.
[319:20.63]Who are you?
[319:21.55]A friend of mine.
[319:22.57]Get the hell off of her, you son of a bitch.
[319:25.93]Hey.
[319:27.19]Hey, take it easy.
[319:29.49]There's no problem here.
[319:31.97]Lee, if you don't get out of here right now,
[319:35.37]Good timing.
[319:35.87]Stab!
[319:39.47]Basecamp is in the way of options?
[319:41.69]Alright, let's go to the hotel.
[320:09.61]Jesus.
[320:10.63]Holy shit, that was an entrance.
[320:14.58]I'm looking for somebody.
[320:15.44]Friend of hers.
[320:15.88]No, the options.
[320:16.68]Move your face.
[320:17.60]How about I just get out of here completely?
[320:38.29]What purpose?
[320:38.85]No, that's like ammo and shit.
[320:39.97]I can't be anywhere.
[320:43.55]Can I not?
[320:43.99]I can't be up here, right?
[320:49.28]Can I be up here?
[320:57.57]No trouble now, please.
[321:06.16]How did you lock it that quick?
[321:07.54]Bust through it.
[321:32.87]Hey!
[321:33.33]How are you?
[321:34.41]A friend of hers.
[321:35.57]Get out of here, buddy.
[321:36.73]I paid.
[321:37.33]I ain't paid to hit her, you goddamn animal.
[321:40.44]Come here!
[321:42.42]Hey, I... I paid for the... Wasting my time.
[321:48.93]Oh, that guy was pathetic.
[321:50.47]What the hell are you doing here?
[321:52.71]Trying to play him.
[321:54.29]Not very well.
[321:56.03]You okay?
[321:57.65]Fine.
[321:58.53]You sure?
[321:58.89]Yeah.
[321:59.73]Just let his face fucking smash into the ground.
[322:04.19]Men, but... Stupid bastard.
[322:07.66]Stupid bastard was boasting about the bank.
[322:09.78]The bank?
[322:11.38]Sure, I know small town banks are usually a waste of time, but... The desync is back?
[322:14.94]It's a livestock town.
[322:15.74]There's lots of cash sometimes.
[322:17.38]I'm gonna ask him why.
[322:18.88]Okay.
[322:20.33]Keep investigating.
[322:21.97]I will.
[322:30.89]Okay, some keynotes.
[322:40.88]Okay, now they're not taking it.
[322:49.10]I don't know why I look like Dante.
[322:53.93]From the Capcom series.
[322:56.22]Dante devil may Dante may cry Dante devils may cry I Can't open this door Dante may cry Thank You Arthur
[323:24.01]I don't much like being saved, but when I have to be.
[323:26.59]I understand.
[323:28.71]You okay?
[323:29.75]Sure.
[323:30.17]He only punched me.
[323:31.29]Arthur punched him a lot harder.
[323:32.57]Yeah, alright now.
[323:33.97]Hey, who's that guy over there looking at us?
[323:37.19]Weren't you in Blackwater a few weeks back?
[323:39.29]It's Benny from Vegas.
[323:41.35]Oh, you were.
[323:42.37]Well, I definitely saw you with a bunch of fellas.
[323:45.15]Me?
[323:45.79]No, impossible.
[323:47.59]Listen, buddy, come here for a minute.
[323:49.43]I saw you.
[323:49.95]Come here.
[323:50.73]Come on, get up.
[323:53.42]I don't like this.
[323:54.60]Me neither.
[323:55.84]Go get the girls home.
[323:57.02]I'm gonna go have a word with our friend.
[323:58.90]Is that even my horse?
[324:02.38]That's not my horse!
[324:03.15]Where's my horse?
[324:04.95]This is not even my horse, man.
[324:22.72]Okay, well... That's far enough!
[324:29.14]Let's lasso this guy.
[324:34.18]Come on!
[324:38.35]You have to help me!
[324:48.31]Please!
[324:49.37]I can't get up!
[324:54.11]Why are you telling lies about me?
[324:55.95]No, no.
[324:57.95]I got it wrong, partner.
[324:59.27]I got it very wrong.
[325:00.95]Step on his fingers.
[325:03.25]I ain't never been in Blackwater.
[325:05.72]Then why are you chasing me?
[325:08.78]I've got an unfortunate face.
[325:11.28]Yes, yes, me too.
[325:13.94]Now please pull me up.
[325:15.80]Please.
[325:17.41]I'm going to step on his fingers.
[325:29.44]Alright.
[325:30.20]Come on.
[325:34.86]I don't know what's going on here.
[325:39.31]You okay, partner?
[325:41.65]No.
[325:44.35]No balls.
[325:45.27]What?
[325:48.03]I literally, like, have been throwing dynamite at people and fucking running people over with my horse truck all day.
[325:53.16]I help one guy up and all of a sudden I'm a coward.
[325:56.92]Give me Brooks.
[325:59.68]I think it's best for both of us if we pretend this never happened.
[326:04.70]Well, I agree.
[326:07.60]You saved my life.
[326:09.38]You're a good man, and I, uh... Here.
[326:13.18]You want a pen?
[326:14.30]It's one of them steel ones.
[326:15.34]It sucked.
[326:15.79]Oh.
[326:18.87]That's very kind of you.
[326:19.89]That belt is not even on.
[326:21.69]That is four sizes too big.
[326:23.91]Jimmy Brooks.
[326:25.59]Not usually.
[326:27.57]You see... I kind of look like a clown.
[326:29.23]I was in Blackwater.
[326:31.91]I kill people.
[326:34.49]And maybe I should have killed you.
[326:35.91]I definitely should have.
[326:38.19]Should I have killed you, Jimmy Brooks?
[326:41.62]Me?
[326:44.04]I never saw you.
[326:46.50]Not now, not never.
[326:49.29]I think we have an understanding?
[326:51.87]Of course we do.
[326:54.16]Jimmy Brooks.
[326:55.62]I will remember that.
[326:57.32]I've got a good memory.
[326:59.54]I haven't.
[327:01.98]I haven't.
[327:03.72]Not, not one lick, not one sense in this here old mind.
[327:13.09]Come on, come on.
[327:15.27]You have a nice day now, sir.
[327:25.74]I'm not going to do it.
[327:27.73]You can return the horse you stole to its owner in Valentin to gain honor.
[327:31.15]I'm going to do that.
[327:33.47]I don't want this thing.
[327:34.13]This thing's... Where's my horse?
[327:41.36]Alright, I want to go back to Valentin.
[327:47.60]Back here, please.
[327:48.24]$32 bounty!
[327:53.08]What is this comedy tragedy face here?
[327:57.52]Show.
[327:57.78]Alright, we're gonna do that first.
[328:07.49]Show sounds like clunk.
[328:12.75]Oh, that would have killed the horse for sure.
[328:15.36]Hello, mister?
[328:17.74]Who's talking to me?
[328:18.88]Oh.
[328:23.34]Figured I'd try.
[328:27.99]I don't know.
[328:53.14]It's over here, hold on.
[329:08.05]Got it.
[329:14.85]Here you are, sir.
[329:17.53]Which one was the guy that needed the horse?
[329:20.57]You?
[329:21.88]You... Whose horse is this?
[329:23.04]Whose... Whose horse do I have?
[329:32.11]Whose horse is this?! !
[330:07.79]Give me my actual horse, please.
[330:10.19]I don't want this fucking guy.
[330:11.05]Do I have any more meat?
[330:15.61]No, this is mine.
[330:16.65]You ain't scaring nobody, baby.
[330:34.70]I can't fucking help it.
[330:36.74]I'm sorry.
[330:37.74]It doesn't matter what game it is.
[330:40.10]Open... If you give me freedom to do whatever I want, I will never do the thing I'm supposed to do.
[330:48.07]It'll never happen.
[330:50.81]I just... I accidentally complete missions in these games.
[331:00.58]Okay.
[331:01.56]I got everything.
[331:07.13]There was a bar fight.
[331:12.95]Over here.
[331:14.11]At the saloon.
[331:20.22]What is in here?
[331:23.08]Uh, savings bank.
[331:24.92]Okay.
[331:33.10]Optional mission is available.
[331:35.19]Get out of my fucking way.
[331:37.47]Okay, the skull.
[331:38.63]Completely going to be a way to gain honor.
[331:40.03]Okay, let's go right here.
[331:40.95]Hey, you smell like trouble.
[332:02.19]I didn't- I thought he was dead, isn't this- Back in the day, if someone was dead, you could take their shoes and shit.
[332:11.61]There were no rules?
[332:12.57]Is this guy gonna shoot me?
[332:14.35]I picked up loot on a guy's body.
[332:18.78]Who's this?
[332:24.62]What about- I've lost control.
[332:26.34]I've lost control.
[332:28.02]I've lost control.
[332:33.07]$67!
[332:33.15]Just die!
[332:34.25]Whose horse is this?
[333:09.04]Just, just come get me.
[333:11.55]Just come get me.
[333:14.57]Just come and get me.
[333:16.45]Just come and get me.
[333:17.41]How do I say I surrender?
[333:18.73]Who's screaming?
[333:30.99]Fuck, I, no, I'm not having a hundred fucking dollar bounty.
[333:34.22]Anybody in here?
[333:40.30]Don't!
[333:40.66]I'm a coward!
[333:41.52]I don't have any money to pay for this!
[333:47.34]This is how red... red... I have to just die.
[334:07.04]I had to just start punching the guy.
[334:09.14]Don't just... Don't do it.
[334:19.87]I did... I started slashing people.
[334:23.20]Okay, I...
[334:44.78]This is all because of the horse.
[334:45.80]I didn't have my horse.
[334:47.74]They gave me this fake ass horse.
[334:50.88]And then I saw the guy lying on the ground.
[334:54.24]Dead.
[334:55.12]So I looted his body and apparently that's illegal.
[334:58.72]Why didn't somebody go pick him up?
[334:59.88]Pick him up if it's so illegal.
[335:01.80]Pick the fucking guy up off the street.
[335:04.98]That could have been a family member for all you know.
[335:11.51]$97.
[335:11.73]And then I got like panicked and I was in the bar and just started blasting that old guy in the face.
[335:22.80]He was unconscious?
[335:24.38]Well, okay, there we go.
[335:25.78]Now I feel at home.
[335:28.78]Whisper.
[335:35.30]There, girl.
[335:38.75]Let's feed the horse.
[335:42.33]And then I just started slashing people.
[335:47.28]I can't help it.
[335:49.20]Whenever there's a scenario, same thing with GTA, man.
[335:52.84]I would just be in on mission, and I would just drive full speed and hit triangle and dive out of the car.
[335:59.81]It was so fun to me.
[336:01.15]I couldn't do it.
[336:02.99]I had to do it.
[336:03.61]I had to.
[336:04.13]Now let's do this little side mission.
[336:08.43]Good evening, mister.
[336:18.26]Sheriff's office.
[336:18.84]Let's do a bounty here.
[336:20.29]For me.
[336:20.69]Well, looky here.
[336:23.43]Maybe this is our man.
[336:25.66]You a bounty hunter, mister?
[336:27.96]Baby, it depends.
[336:29.42]This is like the equivalent of when you go to a restaurant and you just go there and for some reason you don't have any money.
[336:36.24]Oh, well, you owe a $140 bill to the restaurant.
[336:39.60]You've got to go wash dishes now.
[336:41.99]That doesn't happen.
[336:42.89]If you just sit there and you go to eat for fucking free and you go, well, I could go in the back and wash dishes.
[336:49.17]Cut to you in the back of a squad car.
[336:51.01]Attracts delinquents and reprobates like flies.
[336:56.69]Now, I'm not a fella to pass a quick judgment, but I've been around long enough to know you don't hire a saint to catch a sinner.
[337:04.17]That's that trope.
[337:06.05]You're gonna be working in the back of the kitchen, right there with no money.
[337:10.75]So, what is it you need?
[337:13.89]Why don't you have a look at that poster on the wall over there?
[337:17.97]He's a low-down huckster.
[337:20.44]He's been poisoning folks with his miracle cure from here to Ansburg.
[337:24.72]Killed more than Landon Ricketts without even pulling a trigger.
[337:27.32]That's not the guy from the first game, is it?
[337:29.02]Sick satisfaction out of it.
[337:31.01]Filler over at the saloon says he thought he saw him by the gorge straight north of here.
[337:36.33]You think you can bring him in?
[337:38.56]The money's good.
[337:40.65]I need him alive, though.
[337:42.39]I want to make sure the women... He just gave the eyes like, oh, fuck, I don't know what this guy's playing.
[337:47.07]That's going to be tough.
[337:49.37]I'll see what I can do.
[337:50.80]Fuck, dude, you know what you're asking?
[337:56.94]And we need him alive.
[337:58.40]That's an important point.
[338:00.24]Last known location of the bounty is marked with a skull.
[338:03.72]Let's take a look.
[338:08.10]He is far.
[338:09.40]A $97 bounty.
[338:11.26]Let's go!
[338:13.22]But!
[338:14.32]I don't have any money.
[338:15.10]What am I talking about?
[338:15.66]I need to buy some stuff.
[338:20.48]I have a $97 fucking person tab because of all the people I've murdered.
[338:25.18]Let's go.
[338:25.77]Let's go.
[338:38.09]Is it worth buying a PS4 to play this game?
[338:41.33]Well, it's definitely worth buying a PS4 in general because it has some of the best games of this generation.
[338:48.84]That is a fact.
[339:01.01]Spider-Man, Bloodborne...
[339:04.56]I mean, God of War.
[339:08.42]List them.
[339:09.40]List them all.
[339:16.17]Two games?
[339:16.81]I just named three games off the top of my head.
[339:22.83]I can't see that far.
[339:23.83]Okay, I can take this.
[339:24.95]I can cut here.
[339:27.57]Fortnite's on.
[339:28.11]Why would Fortnite...
[339:33.38]Those are three exclusive games.
[339:34.74]And by the way, those three games I listed are arguably some of the best games that have come out in years.
[339:40.57]Bloodborne is the best game to come out in like a decade.
[339:44.51]Yeah, I get ten years.
[339:45.89]That's the one that's come out.
[339:47.51]That's the one.
[339:53.99]The Last of Us?
[339:55.29]Oh, don't even get me started.
[339:56.40]But Bloodborne, ten years.
[340:00.38]Alright, hold on.
[340:00.84]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[340:07.13]I probably should get rid of the light.
[340:11.46]Get rid of the light.
[340:11.96]There's a guy up there.
[340:16.83]Does he match the description?
[340:36.83]Ah, what we got here?
[340:38.03]Is that him?
[340:42.52]That's him.
[340:58.91]Are you Benedict Albright?
[341:02.20]Oh, sir?
[341:06.51]Not me.
[341:06.71]I got gold.
[341:07.21]It's just... My mother's real sick.
[341:37.18]I mean, we could drop the theatrics and I could just punch him in the face.
[341:56.38]Game's over, mister.
[341:57.84]Put your hands up.
[341:58.70]I'm taking you in.
[341:59.71]Taking me in?
[342:00.67]What for?
[342:01.19]Apparently that stuff you're pushing is killing folk.
[342:03.61]There's a price on your head.
[342:04.94]I don't know.
[342:05.56]It ain't my business.
[342:06.34]Come on, partner.
[342:07.04]That's crap.
[342:08.00]I'm a healer.
[342:10.40]I got an aura.
[342:11.20]I speak to spirits.
[342:12.70]I'm a scientist.
[342:14.96]Folks get real angry for no good reason.
[342:17.69]This is a mistake.
[342:19.23]He's going to do the thing where he drops off the cliff and he's fine.
[342:22.27]They only want you for questioning.
[342:24.95]I have to insist that this is a mistake.
[342:28.31]Don't be a fool.
[342:30.73]There he goes.
[342:32.11]Hold on.
[342:33.95]I'm slipping.
[342:34.87]Shit.
[342:36.54]Come on.
[342:37.10]Get up.
[342:41.46]Come on.
[342:43.64]Is this something I'm supposed to do?
[342:51.25]What?
[342:51.49]No, he's fine, he's fine, he's fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[343:00.14]I need that light.
[343:00.64]I need the lantern.
[343:01.24]It's so dark.
[343:14.21]Where is he?
[343:14.55]It's so dark, I can't even see where he is.
[343:16.25]Shit.
[343:20.85]I got a cross.
[343:24.77]What?
[343:28.58]Swim to the edge.
[343:31.76]Grab onto something.
[343:34.56]I don't go fast enough.
[343:40.18]Look out, the rapids.
[343:42.02]Hold your breath.
[343:49.28]Is he alive?
[343:49.78]He's right over- Okay, he's right there.
[343:56.19]Am I supposed to do something about this?
[343:57.79]Do I need to, like, go over- Got him.
[344:15.22]Don't dur- Don't drown, right?
[344:21.28]Alright.
[344:33.65]I almost got away.
[344:36.33]He's going back in the water.
[344:37.90]That's even worse.
[344:53.56]I'm not gonna be mad if I take his wallet, right?
[344:56.92]Three dollars, miracle tonic, and a platinum band.
[345:04.28]Back to the sheriff.
[345:16.05]Stole his wedding ring.
[345:20.09]Riding through deep water with a hog-type passenger would cause them to fall from the back of your horse and most likely drown.
[345:27.37]Okay.
[345:27.97]Duly noted.
[345:28.77]I will not go through the deep water.
[345:32.88]Not gonna do that shit.
[345:39.72]Do I have to cross at some point here?
[345:42.22]I gotta cross over here.
[345:43.00]Is this deep?
[345:43.76]How deep is this?
[345:48.45]Okay.
[345:49.43]He's good.
[345:56.29]I just heard something.
[345:57.51]I heard the animal of some sort.
[345:58.64]Just stay on the road.
[346:01.66]I hear, like, wolves and shit.
[346:06.52]If I hit... I'll kill him if I hit him like another...
[346:28.16]I'm not doing that again.
[346:28.99]Get him to the chair.
[346:29.73]No.
[346:30.07]I'm going to scramble his brains.
[346:40.60]Sir, this isn't necessary.
[346:43.98]I'm a medical man.
[346:46.56]I'm here.
[346:46.94]It's just a big mistake.
[346:48.56]Oh, I don't feel very well.
[346:51.08]I told you to shut up.
[346:52.28]No, I don't feel so well, Mr. You know.
[346:54.40]Who made you judge?
[346:55.90]You know what I'm saying.
[346:57.04]I'm only in it for the money.
[346:59.00]He don't understand you more.
[347:01.22]Oh, my lord.
[347:01.78]Got him.
[347:02.74]I wasn't expecting you back so soon.
[347:04.82]And he brought him in.
[347:07.51]Just leave it.
[347:08.43]Sure.
[347:09.79]What do you want?
[347:10.71]Sleep it off, buddy.
[347:12.67]There's been some terrible mistake.
[347:14.17]I know.
[347:15.80]Are you enjoying this compared to the first game?
[347:28.81]You ain't much of a man.
[347:30.45]You ask folks for forgiveness, you remember this, partner?
[347:33.61]I've already forgotten.
[347:35.33]Now, sir, how much was you offering?
[347:38.58]Uh, $50.
[347:39.30]Here.
[347:40.36]Thank you.
[347:42.36]Madam.
[347:45.52]Not even enough to cover how much I owe the state.
[347:56.05]That's cool.
[347:58.79]And what is this big puke stain here?
[348:03.21]What's going on with the map here?
[348:04.33]Oh.
[348:04.53]What's that?
[348:12.76]Now, this little crow don't look like one of ours.
[348:16.14]Can I have a word?
[348:18.34]Well, if this one ain't better, I won't hear any duffy.
[348:22.88]Oatmeal.
[348:23.43]What?
[348:23.87]I do, I do.
[348:25.99]You're dead!
[348:27.69]Is that all you got?
[348:30.67]You're going to pay me to end you.
[348:43.00]How am I supposed to fight three people at the same time?
[348:44.46]I know.
[348:48.67]Did I shoot myself?
[348:53.93]Did I shoot myself in the back of the head?
[348:55.79]No.
[349:06.69]You suck at fist fights?
[349:08.57]Three people punching me in the face at the same time.
[349:27.48]That guy was... That guy was going like this.
[349:30.36]Alright, let's try that again.
[349:40.75]So, Odris... Yeah, Odriskels are bad guys.
[349:42.71]Okay.
[349:54.56]Let's try this again.
[349:55.30]They were all hanging out in the front door.
[349:57.20]Three goons.
[350:01.08]Come on, sir.
[350:02.59]Try to remember what really happened to Sylvia Sloan back in 76.
[350:06.75]Hey!
[350:07.75]Wasn't a lot of buff, Plato.
[350:08.91]It was just a lot of buff.
[350:11.17]It's not Bonk, Mr. Callaway, sir.
[350:13.69]Who's your friend there?
[350:15.39]Put that in your fucking book, Plato.
[350:17.59]This is Jim Boy Callaway.
[350:20.32]The Jim Boy Callaway.
[350:23.08]Who?
[350:24.26]The Gunslinger.
[350:25.96]Fastest left-handed draw that ever drew breath.
[350:28.70]He once killed 14 men in a fight at Lousy Hollow.
[350:33.31]What are you waiting for?
[350:34.61]How do you mean?
[350:35.79]Well, I reckon right now, kill him yourself.
[350:39.07]I don't want to kill him.
[350:40.37]I want to deify him.
[350:42.01]He's a god.
[350:43.43]I'm trying to write his biography.
[350:45.61]How's that going?
[350:46.74]I think I prefer the duel.
[350:48.40]Either I'd kill him and be able to be Baltimore's finest ever Gunslinger, or he'd kill me and I could be set free from ever having to speak to him again.
[350:57.12]Well, you're starting to understand something very important.
[351:00.14]What's that?
[351:01.06]The joys of gunslinging.
[351:03.26]It's win-win, freedom or glory.
[351:05.22]That's brilliant.
[351:06.32]I'm going to write that down, if I may.
[351:08.26]Be my guest.
[351:09.98]What's your name?
[351:12.44]I don't have a name.
[351:13.86]But you are a Gunslinger.
[351:15.52]Not really.
[351:16.56]I mean, folks who need shooting, I try and shoot in the back.
[351:19.65]All that other stuff, it's...
[351:21.40]Well, bunk.
[351:22.86]But you fought duels.
[351:24.50]Once upon a time, I may have.
[351:26.79]And you ain't interested in fame?
[351:29.45]I don't think so.
[351:30.65]Strange.
[351:31.73]But you like fortune.
[351:33.29]I need money, sure.
[351:34.93]Okay.
[351:35.79]And forgive me, mister, if I seem a little desperate.
[351:38.79]I am a little desperate.
[351:40.85]This book, I gotta make a thing of it.
[351:43.23]And, well, there's a whole list of gunfighters.
[351:47.07]Legends, every last one.
[351:50.01]Emmett Granger...
[351:52.08]Flacco Hernandez Billy midnight black bell Maybe you can go and speak to them ask him about Calloway any of them get up bullshit Shoot him
[352:07.88]I can't believe I just said that, but... You want me to go and find some sad, deluded fools like him, ask if he was the greatest, and then if they get uppity, shoot them?
[352:18.94]Does sound a lot worse than it did in my head.
[352:21.30]How much you paying?
[352:22.12]Well, a lot.
[352:23.17]Half the proceeds of the book, if you help me get it written.
[352:26.03]I'll see what I can do.
[352:27.17]Ha!
[352:28.27]Oh, get photos.
[352:30.88]Oh, you got a camera, man.
[352:32.16]Okay.
[352:32.34]So, inspect documents.
[352:33.04]This is a whole, this is a whole can of worms here.
[352:34.88]Married six times, sick gentleman, gamblers, robbers, outlaws, everyone.
[352:57.24]Last report in sighting.
[352:58.94]Blue Water Marsh.
[352:59.92]Do not approach.
[353:00.52]Too dangerous for mere biographer.
[353:02.18]Alright, well this is... Black Bell.
[353:09.53]Alright.
[353:10.65]So, ladies and gentlemen.
[353:13.69]I believe we're going to call it an evening here.
[353:17.57]Getting to be about 9pm Pacific.
[353:20.45]Which is about midnight Eastern.
[353:25.66]Uh, I'll give you my first impressions.
[353:26.96]Actual, real first impressions.
[353:28.14]The game's great.
[353:30.10]I'm having a blast.
[353:30.84]It's fun just to dick around, as you plainly see.
[353:35.61]Uh, so what?
[353:36.21]We bought six hours here.
[353:37.33]We're gonna do bits and everything.
[353:40.03]So, here's what's gonna happen over the next day or two.
[353:45.78]This is the internet.
[353:46.84]The internet fucking works great.
[353:48.68]Right?
[353:50.18]I'm at 6,000 upstream.
[353:51.74]Stream looks good, right?
[353:53.30]Good bid rate.
[353:55.31]Barely dropped any frames the entire time.
[353:56.93]I think we might be in the clear here.
[354:49.21]um any okay anyways uh which one's mine uh I so okay so I'm gonna see what star is doing the next day and uh I think Lethal League is probably gonna be the next thing I play on the channel
[355:17.84]green screen screen if you haven't uh you don't know the horse the horse can die the horse can die the horse can die hi I quit the game
[355:52.80]Okay.
[355:55.04]So.
[355:56.34]There's Lethal League.
[355:57.42]There's this again.
[355:58.80]I'm having a blast playing this.
[355:59.76]You'll see this again.
[356:00.96]Green screen stream is going to happen probably within the next week.
[356:06.40]I'm going to get a poll in the Discord.
[356:07.98]So I'm probably not going to talk about it too much more.
[356:12.86]The next stream, maybe I'll bring it up one more time.
[356:15.09]But the recommendations, suggestions for all the actions for the green screen stream are going to be in that Discord.
[356:21.19]So...
[356:23.41]If you haven't said anything or you want to contribute, it's there.
[356:27.56]We already talked about the rules.
[356:28.82]Watch the VOD from a few days ago.
[356:31.60]And that is going to be it.
[356:35.44]So if the internet is working tomorrow, I'm going to stream.
[356:40.88]I'm going to go as much as I can.
[356:43.50]So I'm going to get in contact with some people.
[356:46.81]We're going to try to get some streams together.
[356:48.49]And then I'll see you when I see you.
[356:51.98]unplugging the console is the only safe way you know that's that is true so uh let's move on to here and let's go over the bits here uh where is the oh there it is okay because oh nice to see you stream
[357:19.99]Yeah, well, I'm glad to finally get, like, an actual, like, full five, six plus hour stream.
[357:25.19]It's been a long time.
[357:27.15]So, it's good to be back.
[357:28.11]Hopefully, we are actually back.
[357:30.35]And the internet does not fuck with us anymore over the next couple of weeks.
[357:35.03]It might.
[357:36.03]I can't guarantee.
[357:36.83]I can't promise that it's going to be completely solved.
[357:40.66]Let's hope so.
[357:41.54]Because this is the first time in a while that we've had a stable connection.
[357:45.60]So, with that, we're going to go back a little bit here.
[357:50.33]And we're going to do... We'll do the credits last.
[357:53.92]Pocket Pauling gave $50 earlier.
[357:55.40]Thank you so much, dude.
[357:56.08]That's a lot of fucking money.
[357:57.46]$50 in Pocket Pauling.
[358:00.46]Devakitty gave $1.
[358:01.06]Hey, Jerma, your short stream of Red Dead solidified my purchasing of a PS4.
[358:05.52]And I've been playing it ever since.
[358:07.28]I needed another exclusive on top of games like Bloodborne and God of War to justify it.
[358:11.77]And when you blew that guy's head off with his shotgun, I figured I'd have to play it.
[358:17.59]Devakitty, thank you for the $1.
[358:19.02]And, yes.
[358:20.80]We haven't even scratched the surface.
[358:22.48]There's so much shit to do.
[358:25.56]But, thank you.
[358:27.44]Thank you also to JabbaDab again for your massive amount of sub-gifting tonight.

[359:15.39]Also, be careful.
[359:16.07]Spoilers ahead.
[359:17.75]Dobby, the elf from Harry Potter.
[359:23.05]Something happens to him.
[359:24.65]But thank you.
[359:26.08]Thank you, Atrolux Atrox, for the $1.25.

[359:49.36]But thank you, Megaboob, so much.
[359:52.83]Uh, Jess Homeboy, thanks for the $1.
[359:56.15]Three weeks ago, Hurricane Michael hit my town.
[359:58.77]County didn't have any power for two weeks.
[360:01.42]Afterwards, I called Comcast to get internet back, but there's just a pre-recorded message saying to go on the website to contact someone so someone would come out, but we couldn't do that because no internet.
[360:12.41]We still don't have internet.
[360:13.65]I'm out of town and happen to catch you live and contact them.
[360:16.19]Regardless, happy...
[360:18.21]To see you just happy to catch your streams again and glad to see you safely in Vegas.
[360:22.23]Fuck Comcast Comcast I went from Comcast to Cox and I'll be honest with you the Ain't much different Unfortunately, like 80 to 90 percent of the entire country is made up of about three or four different companies and it's just pick your poison and
[360:46.63]Of the companies that actually care and give lightning-fast stable service, they're only in little bits and bobs in the country.
[360:59.06]Verizon Fios, for example.
[361:01.74]I will shill and praise the fuck out of them every time.
[361:04.58]They're only in a few places.
[361:06.22]They're only in, like, the Northeast and then some sections out, like, New York, maybe.
[361:12.65]Google Fiber.
[361:13.73]That's, you can't, nobody can, I have this theory that Google Fiber doesn't exist.
[361:19.41]And everyone, like, oh yeah, this place has Google Fiber.
[361:23.45]Does it?
[361:23.89]Anybody have it?
[361:25.07]No.
[361:26.44]It's just there.
[361:26.94]It's in the middle of like Texas somewhere.
[361:32.56]You have it.
[361:33.26]Well, I'm glad somebody does.
[361:35.84]But there are like a handful of internet companies that
[361:39.65]aren't just the big box, like, Best Buy internets, but it's almost impossible to avoid them.
[361:47.03]When looking for places, I've actually seen quite a few people comment on this about, well, why did you move to a place that has bad internet?
[361:58.76]I mean, it's not like it was an easy thing to be like, oh, hey, I'm going to move into a house and...
[362:06.41]Before I purchase a house, or before I sign a lease agreement, I'm gonna buy internet, install it, and test it.
[362:13.20]That's just... You can't do that.
[362:16.65]That's impossible.
[362:19.80]All you can do is just check speeds and check on, you know, where location-wise and how new is the infrastructure and you can't like go move into a house and then buy internet and test it and then, oh, you know what?
[362:31.46]Internet doesn't really work that well.
[362:33.26]Please tear by lease in half.
[362:35.46]It's like, what?
[362:36.38]You can't do that.
[362:39.19]Hey, dude, can I, mind if I stream at your house before I buy it?
[362:44.27]Ask the neighbors or something?
[362:45.15]Well, here's the problem with that.
[362:46.25]Because there's so many different packages, right?
[362:49.06]Your neighbor might not even have remotely close to what you need.
[362:53.06]So, if your neighbor... Oh, yeah, like, can I test your internet?
[362:56.38]Can I knock on your door and test your internet?
[362:57.92]I'm like, I'm sorry, I'm a fucking weirdo.
[362:59.54]I need to... Oh, yeah, we have 25 down, like, 2 up.
[363:03.83]That's not gonna be a... That's not gonna work.
[363:09.71]You just have to follow speeds, and the speeds... I mean, before we had all these issues, we had a gigabit line.
[363:17.27]That's a thousand down.
[363:20.63]It's just a question of trying to... Like, okay, there's like a problem.
[363:24.82]There's like an infrastructural problem in this whole, like... There's like five or six areas that have like these major... That they're being like fixed and maintained and maintenance and... It seems like it's done.
[363:37.16]You know what I'm saying?
[363:44.87]This is the first time I've had like 6,000 up green light the whole night.
[363:51.12]But Etalyx and I desperately, desperately have been keeping on top of this every single day.
[363:59.33]It's actually gotten in the way of a lot of other things that we wanted to do.
[364:03.99]Because it's been every single day we've tried to get it situated and fixed and updated.
[364:08.77]It has nothing to do with us trying to... Oh, this is not streamed for like three weeks.
[364:18.44]So...
[364:19.90]Cross your fingers, it seems like the problem has been solved.
[364:23.54]I hate to say that out loud because tomorrow I might wake up and it might be off, but, you know, I can hope, right?
[364:30.49]Anyways, that's the situation with that.
[364:34.87]Eaves, hey, thanks for the $1, dude.
[364:38.51]Hope you're doing great, Jerma.
[364:39.35]Here's some bits.
[364:40.71]Well, for being you missing.
[364:43.06]For being missing your streams dearly, my friend.
[364:45.40]I'm glad you're back.
[364:46.70]Hope you didn't have to fight any stand users up in that balloon.
[364:54.20]Stand users?
[364:55.42]Also, your Olive Garden joke made me audibly sigh.
[365:06.47]What Olive Garden?
[365:10.34]It's a JoJo reference.
[365:12.14]Oh, okay.
[365:13.88]Spreo gave a bunch of gifted subs, too.
[365:16.40]Thank you, Spreo.
[365:17.76]JabbaDab again.

[370:24.19]Once streaming is over, well, I'm like 50 years old.
[370:27.14]I've been streaming for 25 years.
[370:28.92]I'm going into retirement.
[370:29.88]I'm gonna be the guy that's on the makeup containers at the party store.

[370:52.07]Oh, and he linked my 500 subs curl video.
[371:00.28]46,796 views.
[371:06.14]That video has only received views retroactively, by the way.
[371:10.79]When I made that video, and even a year or two later, it had, like, probably 600 views.
[371:20.77]But anyways, thank you, Topec.
[371:23.03]It's good to be back.
[371:24.77]Invictus99, thanks for the $5.
[371:26.47]Please fix your fucking sideburns.

[371:36.04]Hey, eDragon, thanks for the $10, eDragon.
[371:39.48]Great stream as usual.
[371:40.74]Save this for when you lose all your money at the casino.
[371:46.62]There are a lot of them around here.
[371:50.37]There are a lot of them.
[371:51.83]I don't think I'll lose all my money, though.
[371:53.31]But thank you so much for the $10, eDragon.
[371:59.64]Tyruku.
[372:00.92]Tyruku, thanks for the $1.

[372:03.04]You've made me smile during some rough times in my life.
[372:05.66]Went away.
[372:06.22]Now I'm glad I can watch again.
[372:10.04]Glad you're here.
[372:11.52]Thank you for the $1 and for the kind message here.
[372:16.71]Thank you so much, Tyru.
[372:19.98]Much love to you.
[372:21.44]Tingy, thanks for the $5, Tingy.
[372:22.93]Resending the message I originally posted on your first stream back.
[372:25.75]Again, it's too long for Twitch, so here's a screenshot.
[372:33.48]Let's see.
[372:33.84]This is from... This is from Tingy.
[372:39.85]Jeremy, I've got some great news.
[372:40.71]Recently just purchased my first house.
[372:43.17]It's located in the Boston area.
[372:44.60]The realtor told me it was used to be owned by a short old man who used to yell a lot at his computer.
[372:51.59]uh according to his neighbors apparently just before moving out he also invited one of the neighbors over to fake party or something he told me that he saw him outside as he got home from work and invited him in offered champagne and made dumb jokes I got this house for really cheap because it had extensive anyways moved to Vegas went smoothly can't wait to see what streams you cook up in the future much love
[373:21.92]You had me for the first sentence, and then I figured out what was going on.
[373:25.34]Thank you, Tingy, for the five bucks.
[373:28.35]Thank you, Topac, for the two bucks.
[373:29.65]You gotta get one of your mods or something to figure out why... Oh, the way to keep good VODs from getting deleted.
[373:35.24]Playlist or something.
[373:36.00]It's awesome to have them saved with chat.
[373:40.60]Yeah, actually, I just recently gave sort of the go-ahead to that Archive channel.
[373:48.81]I talked to that Archive channel briefly.
[373:51.41]They've been re-uploading those streams pretty much forever.
[373:56.67]And while it's nice to have with chat, I know that I could probably highlight them and everything, but...
[374:02.08]To be completely honest with you here, when you go to like video, the videos tab on Twitch, I kind of like the fact that it's just the last like two months worth of streams.
[374:13.95]Just because if otherwise it's like just hundreds, just scrolling down hundreds and hundreds and hundreds of videos potentially.
[374:29.82]And, like, they made an extension that you can save, chat.
[374:32.63]They're adding an extension for it.
[374:38.11]Well, I'll look into it.
[374:40.35]And I don't mean that as, like, the jokey, like, bullshit thing that I say.
[374:43.75]Because, at one hand, I know a lot of people already go to that channel.
[374:50.46]You know what I mean?
[374:51.22]Like, most people are already watching that channel.
[374:55.42]And...
[374:57.59]They're like, oh, hey, by the way, like, just don't even go there anymore.
[375:01.03]I feel like there's a lot of people that probably wouldn't even know that that was happening.
[375:04.85]And there's a ton of people that don't even watch this channel live.
[375:09.52]You know what I mean?
[375:12.00]I would actually assume a pretty large majority of people don't actually watch these live.
[375:18.84]Or if you do, you're here for a certain amount of time, maybe you're here the whole time, however that may be.
[375:24.85]But if you only know about, like, oh, I know that I can just watch the replays on this channel, and then, you know, what if I, like, just randomly, they just, uploads just stop happening on that channel.
[375:35.98]And then it has to announce it, like, oh, it's over, like, it's pulling back to Twitch.
[375:40.92]I feel like if it's not broke, don't fix it at this point right now.
[375:46.94]and two months back with chat and then after like the 60 days without chat I mean I I just don't think there's anything I necessarily want to do about it right now but um
[376:06.51]If there's an extension coming out, maybe it can be put on the side.
[376:09.75]I really wish, like, there was an easy way to do that.
[376:13.47]Without having to, like, potentially delete somebody's YouTube channel that has, like, an archive of hundreds of streams, you know?
[376:22.49]And I would never do something like that.
[376:25.70]We talked about it extensively for a little while.
[376:28.04]We'll see where it goes.
[376:32.17]But, anyways, let's keep going here.
[376:34.25]We're getting to the end of this section here.
[376:37.03]Just over midnight, Eastern Time.
[376:41.59]But thank you, Topek.
[376:42.55]Thank you, Maisykit, for the $1.
[376:43.99]It's probably a good thing you didn't go to TwitchCon because the line was so long that a bunch of people didn't even get in.
[376:48.63]Also, if you live under my bed or something, you can have Google Fiber.
[376:53.05]What was I talking about?
[376:53.69]I was talking about VODs.
[376:56.09]And how Twitch deletes them after 60 days and that there's a channel that has kept pretty much all of them.
[377:01.85]For the last couple of years, at least.
[377:05.79]Yeah, I didn't go to TwitchCon.
[377:06.83]I had no plans to.
[377:07.97]I was in the middle of doing all this shit.
[377:12.37]There was no time to go to any conventions or any events.
[377:15.98]Maybe TwitchCon next year, potentially.
[377:18.30]I mean, I'm going to live close enough.
[377:24.09]But we'll see.
[377:26.48]I did hear that it was a little ridiculous, though.
[377:28.86]And envious that you have Google Fiber.
[377:31.42]Thank you, Maisie.
[377:33.14]Voluki, thanks for the $5, Voluki.
[377:34.60]Hey, Jerma, good to have you back.
[377:35.70]It's been super boring without your streams, and all I've done is D&D.
[377:39.79]Speaking of, I showed our DM CastleGriffinstein, and he loved it so much, he told me he was putting it in the campaign.
[377:46.99]We haven't gotten to it yet.
[377:48.74]And I'm the only one who knows, but we're getting to it very soon.
[377:51.82]Our DM has sent me the actual map so I could send it to you.
[377:55.88]I've been trying to not look at it.
[377:58.34]Just wanted to show you how much your videos have inspired others.
[378:02.48]Let's see.
[378:05.82]It's like really is the whole... That's so... Well, I don't want to spoil you here, but... That's great.
[378:15.56]There.
[378:15.80]Well, I'm going to put it in the chat because this is like... That's great.
[378:23.39]The starting zone into that little area.
[378:26.51]I love how you even have the demon over there on the edge.
[378:33.81]One day there'll be another one.
[378:36.23]One day.
[378:41.98]I hope you have fun.
[378:42.52]I hope that's a lot of fun.
[378:44.09]You'll have to update us all after you do it.
[378:50.67]Because I would be pleased to know that.
[378:52.52]I'm sure a lot of people here would be as well.
[378:54.98]Thank you, Valuki.
[378:56.14]And have fun.
[378:58.06]That went right to a question.
[378:58.80]That was just absolute nonsense, and then like, gotcha, you're playing House Flipper again.
[379:23.91]Did I actually get an update?
[379:25.17]Or is it just you can paint Jack-o'-lanterns?
[379:27.63]You know what I mean?
[379:31.25]I'll look at that after the stream is over, because I love that game.
[379:34.31]Thank you, KelDoz.
[379:35.59]Hey, CluelessSniper, what's going on?
[379:37.03]Thanks for the $1.
[379:37.77]Hey, Jerma, happy day after Halloween.
[379:39.11]Please enjoy this picture of my turtle.
[379:44.51]Aww.
[379:46.95]What are all those candies?
[379:52.32]Those are interesting.
[379:53.20]Like, I see the Kit Kat.
[379:55.32]I said, by the way, great turtle.
[379:58.44]Kit Kats, Smarties, Coffee Crisp.
[380:02.22]And that's an orange.
[380:03.02]Did you put a candle in an orange?
[380:06.66]That's very, very cute.
[380:10.34]Very cute.
[380:13.42]How could you not like it?
[380:14.74]It has candies.
[380:16.82]Very true.
[380:19.02]But happy Halloween to you as well, Clueless Sniper.
[380:20.71]Thank you so much.
[380:24.80]Hey, Tingy!
[380:25.38]Again, thanks for the $1, Tingy.
[380:26.40]I'm glad the internet held itself up tonight.
[380:28.86]But I might have some bad news about Cox.
[380:32.26]Bad news about Cox.
[380:34.81]Oh, I love bad news.
[380:36.09]Let's see.
[380:41.87]Okay, what is this?
[380:47.44]Oh, let's see.
[380:50.18]That's all you can do There's no fix you have to get rid of cops That is the only cure
[381:16.73]There was nothing we could do.
[381:17.87]I bought everything under the sun to try and fix my internet.
[381:20.92]New router, new modem, better service plans, business internet, everything.
[381:26.36]The only thing that fixed it was moving.
[381:30.27]If you're lucky and you have like CenturyLink Fiber or something, then yeah, you can switch to a different internet provider.
[381:38.39]But if you have to use Cox, you're screwed, dude.
[381:43.47]Oh, well.
[381:45.01]Hey!
[381:49.43]That's good, huh?
[381:58.57]Well, I'm close enough to California now.
[382:03.33]Well, it's just... Well, it's another, like, couple hours the other way, this way.
[382:15.36]Hey, we're green today.
[382:18.68]That's unfortunate to hear that from somebody else that also probably had all the problems.
[382:28.83]But I was told with the utmost confidence that they know what our problem is and it's in the process of being completely resolved.
[382:40.07]So...
[382:42.96]I don't know.
[382:43.42]We'll see how the next few months go.
[382:47.44]We'll see.
[382:50.92]Oh, that's... That's going to be... I'm going to have nightmares about that clip tonight.
[383:00.72]Anyways, thank you for that, Tingy.
[383:02.01]Thank you, Skullgirls, for the $1.
[383:03.87]Hey, Jerm, I made a donation for you to see this on the first Red Dead stream, but you got coxed.

[387:04.30]What are you talking about?
[387:05.82]I get the hell out of here.
[387:07.64]I'm going to kick your butt.
[387:11.17]No, the butt.
[387:13.95]Isn't it cold just right here somewhere?
[387:15.47]It has to be cold.
[387:17.75]Sometimes it's just right on the edge of these mountains.
[387:26.84]By the way, notice how I'm slowly trying to find a way to end this video.
[387:33.49]Like, hmm, oh, I'm not pleased.
[387:35.55]Oh, where's Cole?
[387:37.11]Oh, there we go.
[387:52.47]Uh, thank you so much for that.
[387:53.95]That was fucking... I... What?
[388:01.12]No, no.
[388:01.66]I don't know what that is.
[388:04.50]That probably took so long to make.
[388:06.10]Uh, here is the... The full... The full video.
[388:14.75]Uh, thank you so much for that.
[388:17.23]Skullgirls.
[388:20.41]That was an 11 and a half minute.
[388:22.57]That took a month to make that.
[388:25.00]That took one full month of time.
[388:29.76]Holy shit.
[388:31.74]Thank you so much for that.
[388:38.06]Just the fact that somebody made that into that.
[388:42.96]No, that's fantastic, man.
[388:45.25]Thank you so much.
[388:48.05]Gondur Lane, thanks for the $1.
[388:49.29]This isn't Bookworm Adventures 2, Jerma.
[388:50.87]I haven't forgotten.
[388:52.58]I'll play that in like a year.
[388:54.96]Timmy, Tim, Tam, thanks for the $1.
[388:56.72]Hey, Jerm, my dog is injured right now, so the stream really brightened my day.
[389:01.10]Is there a way you can read the bits from the past month worth of streams or they lost time?
[389:06.15]Okay, thanks.
[389:07.57]Lots of love.
[389:09.91]Bye-bye.
[389:11.15]Love you.
[389:11.61]Yep.
[389:12.07]Uh-huh.
[389:13.15]Love you.
[389:13.87]Uh-huh.
[389:14.59]Bye.
[389:17.03]Well, thank you, Timmy Tim Tim.
[389:18.19]First of all, sorry to hear about your dog being injured.
[389:20.99]That does not sound good.
[389:25.05]Hopefully it's nothing too serious, but I'm sorry to hear it nonetheless.
[389:30.55]To answer the second question, there are, all the bits are recorded and saved, but I don't think I'm going to go back like a month just because I don't think I, I don't necessarily have the time right now to do that.
[389:43.78]They're there.
[389:45.16]And I think with some of this direction that I'm going to take the channel here is, but let's just, let's just bring it up for a second.
[389:54.03]remember I told you guys about like the podcast thing that I want to do where one stream every like couple of weeks is there's no game we just hang out for like three or four hours and just chill talk about whatever the hell we want no no like oh I'm gonna have like guests no just be let's just hanging out every couple weeks just that's all we do like a like a calm stream yeah
[390:21.55]And portions of that comb stream could just be, you know, going back and making sure I pick up the ones that I missed.
[390:30.64]That usually ends up, that's usually what ends up happening anyways.
[390:32.88]But going into it without anything else, it starts that way.
[390:38.48]And maybe we could like come up with topics and shit to talk about.
[390:40.96]I don't know.
[390:43.14]I feel like I like doing this kind of thing.
[390:45.84]But it feels, there's going to be a lot, there's going to be changes.
[390:50.33]made to this channel not anything drastic but I think I would much rather because let's be Frank the this is just the end of a stream right very at the end of a stream the stream is over played Red Dead and here we are doing like this whole thing right I would much rather have this be a like a focus
[391:18.70]like three or four times a month.
[391:19.88]You know what I mean?
[391:23.87]Instead of it being, and I'm going to use this word in quotes here, like tacked on at the end of a stream, if that makes any sense.
[391:36.14]Talking to chat?
[391:38.64]Comcast.
[391:40.68]Comcast.
[391:42.68]Oh, God.
[391:47.64]But it wouldn't just be stream over sign.
[391:49.91]There would be things to talk about.
[391:51.51]There'd be things to show and things to do.
[391:54.06]But I much prefer that over...
[391:57.00]Oh dude, how many, how did I read that person?
[391:58.62]How did I read that?
[391:59.16]I gotta make sure I read that.
[392:00.02]You know, I don't, I don't want it to feel like this rushed kind of tacked on.
[392:03.81]Oh, I got an hour to like blow through a bunch of people that gave me a shitload of money.
[392:06.85]You know what I mean?
[392:07.39]I'd rather it be taking our time because people say, dude, when you do the bits, man, if you just read right through them in 40 minutes, it'd be fine.
[392:15.88]But I like talking to them all this shit.
[392:17.64]I like giving each one of these as much attention as I can.
[392:20.76]And maybe we would make it a thing that we just, we just did.
[392:32.51]so a bit stream no no I mean like just the hangout portion of the after streams is what I'm talking about but that wouldn't be something that would happen every other day it would be you know once a week or once every other week Jerm is designated give me money so I'll talk to you streams
[392:57.15]And then on top of that, there are, I haven't really mentioned this because I haven't really had an opportunity to be live for more than like an hour or two.
[393:04.75]But I currently, all the stuff that I've been talking about over the last couple of years is real now.
[393:14.28]Because at this moment right now, I have a studio in Vegas that I'm going to be working exclusively with.
[393:21.22]And it is a full studio.
[393:22.94]Sound stages, green screens.
[393:25.10]And I've already toured them.
[393:26.38]I've already talked to them multiple times.
[393:28.84]So like all that shit that I've always wanted to do is going to start happening.
[393:33.72]So the stream is going to start to take some different directions because that stuff is going to be available for me to do.
[393:40.43]And I want something like that to happen potentially once a month or more than once a month.
[393:47.75]so dynamically we're going to have to start to change how this stream is presented right and we'll figure that out as we go it's not something that I I have no oh yeah this is what's going to happen and this is this is final and I'm never going to play Red Dead 2 ever again green screen stream monthly we talked about this in in depth about the direction that I want to take the channel
[394:16.73]And slowly over time, I'd like to make it a reality.
[394:21.51]And the internet's dying.
[394:23.81]Uh-oh.
[394:26.87]Are we still live?
[394:29.53]That was a full-on drop there.
[394:37.00]We're back.
[394:38.68]We're here.
[394:41.37]uh just kind of shit the bed for about two seconds there pause and unpause alright well that might that's like that's like the Kurt that's like the Kurt why did I is that the first time I've heard that noise all stream that's the first time I've heard that fucking noise the entire stream and it just scared me
[395:03.34]uh anyways that's I think that's like the curtain call here the cane is coming out to try to drag me off the stage so let me let me get through the bits quickly after we'll talk about this uh thank you uh thank you to lucas for the 15 thank you lucas 7151 uh thank you 15 bucks is Red Dead worth getting an Xbox or ps4 to play in your opinion it looks incredible
[395:27.99]I mean, that's up to you.
[395:29.95]If you think that it's worth it.
[395:30.99]I mean, there are a lot of... I don't know if I would buy an Xbox to play Red Dead.
[395:36.88]But a PS4 at least has a bunch of great exclusives so far.
[395:44.66]But... I think if you played the first one, it's more of that and much larger and much more going on.
[395:55.20]But thank you for the $15.
[395:55.74]I wish you luck in your decision on whether or not you'll buy it.
[395:59.62]PS4 has a lot of great games, though.
[396:02.66]And I'm sure there'll be some kind of Black Friday sale.
[396:04.88]Like, right?
[396:05.40]There always is.
[396:07.12]And that's less than a month away.
[396:08.73]But thank you.
[396:09.93]Darkstar, thanks for the $1.50, Darkstar.
[396:12.27]700,000 games.
[396:13.31]I'm so glad you're back and that my offhanded comment months back about a green screen stream has now turned into a big community event.
[396:20.29]Love you, Vegas boy.
[396:22.31]Thank you.
[396:23.81]Yeah.
[396:25.10]You don't think that people in this community come up with great shit?
[396:29.72]We've like talked about stuff in this chat back and forth randomly that's turned into whole streams.
[396:36.07]I love it.
[396:37.27]It's fucking awesome.
[396:39.29]And I want more of it.
[396:40.59]You know what I mean?
[396:43.63]It's 200 bucks for PS4 and Spider-Man.
[396:45.09]That's pretty great.
[396:47.95]But thank you, Darkstar.
[396:49.95]And thank you, Gold Ruby Productions.
[396:53.37]Glad I escaped Vinny's dryer.
[396:59.83]Thank you.
[397:04.45]Eve, thanks for the $1.
[397:06.27]I'm sorry for always saying shitty JoJo references all the time, but I love you, Jeremy.
[397:09.43]Your streams make me laugh a million times more when I'm absolutely sloshed off of screwdrivers.
[397:14.79]Well, screwdriver ain't a bad drink.
[397:19.85]Except I love orange juice, so I can't drink them.
[397:22.83]Because it ruins orange juice for me.
[397:24.43]But they're all good.
[397:27.59]Zazasol, thanks for the $1.
[397:28.83]You're pretty funny and cute.
[397:31.59]Hey, thank you.
[397:32.79]Thanks for that.
[397:34.62]Flathead or Phillipshead?
[397:35.46]Phillipshead for large projects.
[397:38.10]Flathead for small projects.
[397:43.58]Anti-Snowman, thanks for the $5, Anti-Snowman.
[397:46.60]Hey, Jerma, I'm a radio DJ at a small town radio station, and we often have technical difficulties, including the internet going out tonight.
[397:52.99]Your original Red Dead Redemption stream attempt is one of my favorite streams because I could really relate to the pain and stress.
[397:59.49]Be encouraged that even when things go badly, it helps others know that they aren't alone.
[398:02.95]Thanks for the entertainment.
[398:06.46]Yeah, man, thank you for the $5, first of all.
[398:11.51]And yeah, it sucks.
[398:14.70]It sucks being at the mercy of... And here's the problem.
[398:19.10]Being at the mercy of a bunch of companies that just as long as they get their monthly fucking sign-up paychecks from the millions of customers and they don't... Who cares, right?
[398:29.45]That's the problem.
[398:29.91]It's unfortunate.
[398:34.59]It's unfortunate.
[398:38.38]Because there are like so many things that could just be fixed if it wasn't just like, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[398:44.90]How many signups did we have last month?
[398:46.80]Oh, 100,000 more.
[398:48.86]Dude, I want 500,000 signups.
[398:51.12]Sir, there's not even that many people that live in that neighborhood.
[398:54.00]Double them up.
[398:54.68]Tell them they need two internets and tell them that they need two TVs too.
[398:58.09]How many signups is that?
[398:59.41]Sir, that's 1.2 million signups.
[399:01.77]How do we get more signups?
[399:04.07]There's no more people.
[399:05.19]We'll make some more people up.
[399:07.01]Start putting internet in the fucking dirt and give it to the bugs.
[399:14.84]Start charging the fucking ants for internet.
[399:22.00]But I'm confident that we'll be fine.
[399:26.22]Hello, I'd like two internets, please.
[399:31.17]Sure, have one.
[399:37.00]But what can you do besides, you know, hope that the cable companies lose their insane Darth Vader grip on the internet?
[399:49.33]It might take a while.
[399:51.93]It might, you know, they might get to a point where, you know, 5G is coming out here.
[399:56.08]But 5G, 6G, that shit's going to be faster than cable.
[400:00.99]Eventually when like the wireless cell phone tower shit is going to be more powerful than cable.
[400:07.77]And then we get to do it all over again.
[400:16.18]But whatever.
[400:21.36]It is what it is.
[400:24.60]Thank you to where we are now.
[400:27.58]But anti-snowman, thank you so much.
[400:30.86]We are all in it together in the internet, internet of stuff, right?
[400:36.66]We all have to have the good stuff and the bad stuff when it comes to internet, unfortunately.
[400:44.60]But thank you, Foot Fungus for the $1, Topac for the $1.
[400:48.42]Can you play Visage?
[400:49.38]I'm not sure if you talked about any Halloween specials, even though we missed it.
[400:53.22]Visage, is that, what's Visage?
[400:57.90]I've never heard of it.
[400:59.79]Internet of stuff.
[401:02.05]But thank you, Topek.
[401:04.75]Thank you also to MostlyLoss for the $1 here.
[401:07.73]You see, I'm going to get through the bits quickly every single time, and it literally never happens.
[401:10.89]But that's just me telling myself I have to hurry up.
[401:14.99]And then I slow back down, right?
[401:16.62]But at least I know.
[401:18.32]And we're almost done.
[401:19.98]Because TimmyTimTam just gave $2.
[401:21.18]How long are you going to stall until the next mission of L.A.
[401:24.70]Noire?
[401:25.00]You've been stalling with this balloon shit for a month.
[401:29.88]That is L.A.
[401:30.40]Noire is still... That's right.
[401:34.48]That game's fucking funny, too, and fun.
[401:36.62]We got a lot of catching up to do.
[401:37.84]Let's put it that way.
[401:40.26]Shootman2, thanks for the $1.
[401:41.34]Hey, Jerma, great to have you back.
[401:42.51]Speaking of dumb ideas, have you considered doing a 360-degree VR stream where it looks like the viewer is sitting in your lap?
[401:49.75]Well, I don't think... I don't think... I don't think I want to do that.
[401:59.63]Oh, this is giving me a headache coughing at that.
[402:01.63]Thank you, ShootMan2.
[402:04.43]Maybe for some other purpose, but not for people sitting in my lap.
[402:09.06]Troy Dungle, thanks for the $1.
[402:10.60]I'm all with you, Jeremy, on these cable companies.
[402:13.26]Who is with me in chat to put the CEOs of these companies out of business?
[402:17.76]Because they have bad internet.
[402:22.61]It'll happen with 5G and 6G.
[402:24.21]People will start to realize that
[402:26.55]you know, like a $200 a month internet bill, you can eventually, you're going to be able to get that just through the air from a cell tower.
[402:34.42]And it's going to be like $100 less expensive.
[402:37.74]We will see in the next decade a like, a absolute just collapsing of cable companies.
[402:45.06]Just clip this.
[402:46.20]And then in like a decade, go, man, man, remember that guy that was like as smart as Socrates came up with that thing about like the cable companies going down in 10 years?
[402:54.01]Oh, here's like the exact clip of it.
[403:02.30]But yeah, thank you, Torrid Uncle.
[403:03.28]Thank you, TimmyTimTim again.
[403:05.40]Can I have my dollar back?
[403:06.48]I only wanted to cheer once.
[403:08.62]I don't have the capability to do that.
[403:10.56]I can't just go and refund it.
[403:12.84]I'm sorry.
[403:13.52]Thank you.
[403:14.64]Be careful next time.
[403:15.30]Thanks for the three bucks.
[403:19.06]Hey, Eves, thanks for the one dollar.
[403:20.28]Make sure you also play Deltarune at some point.
[403:23.46]Also, you taste like a liar.
[403:27.00]When did you taste what?
[403:29.81]Oh, I'm really drunk.
[403:30.61]Oh, okay.
[403:31.37]Thank you, Yves.
[403:32.56]Hope you had a good night.
[403:34.54]Take care.
[403:35.68]And finally, AppKey, thanks for the $1.
[403:37.28]Hey, Jerma, thanks for all the streams.
[403:38.38]The last streamer I watched banned people for slipping up.
[403:42.48]Thanks for being you.
[403:48.19]Like I've told you guys before, I like having an open chat here.
[403:52.65]And, yeah, I just, just, just, just do your best.
[403:57.65]You know what I mean?
[404:02.92]Just do your best.
[404:07.34]FeelsBirthdayMan.
[404:08.22]Happy birthday!
[404:10.02]And now we are going to end the stream by like this.
[404:16.64]Hold on.
[404:20.78]Is this going to work?
[404:23.50]Uh-oh.
[404:24.31]This might not work.
[404:29.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[404:39.35]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[404:45.35]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[404:50.35]And that should be it - here come the credits!
[404:56.84]Oh, here they come.
[404:57.88]Thank you to all these people that subbed today.
[405:01.44]All of you.
[405:01.82]A bunch of people were gifted subs.
[405:05.18]And a ton of people were resubs.
[405:06.66]Old subs.
[405:07.61]Oh, shitload of you.
[405:09.41]That's fast.
[405:11.17]Mr. Comcast is up there.
[405:13.93]Thank you guys so much.
[405:17.87]I didn't set this up correctly, apparently, in the time I had before the stream.
[405:22.85]But all of you rock.
[405:28.60]We've talked about... I see a lot of the same names.
[405:33.48]And I've seen a lot of the same names for years.
[405:38.00]Like, and that guy just came in for eight months.
[405:44.72]A ton of you guys have been paying me $5 a month for two plus years.
[405:50.34]That's longer than I think I've had a Netflix subscription.
[405:52.40]You know what I mean?
[405:53.68]Seriously.
[405:56.03]Seriously.
[406:00.77]You guys are fucking awesome.
[406:03.49]Thank you for your patience.
[406:04.35]Thanks for bearing with the... All the shit.
[406:11.19]The moving... The internet.
[406:17.26]And I hope you stay tuned.
[406:18.64]Because there's a whole lot of shit going on.
[406:21.64]Over the coming weeks and months.
[406:23.18]That... I hope is worth it.
[406:28.04]And I've been saying that for a while.
[406:30.54]But now I'm here, I'm in Las Vegas, and it's real.
[406:35.32]Look at all these fucking subs.
[406:41.17]Thank you.
[406:49.29]I've seen you around so much, it's like seeing a regular.
[406:51.13]Yeah, the giant bar.
[407:01.17]Let's hope this is the start of the actual return of streaming.
[407:06.69]I wasn't talking to you.
[407:08.99]Shit.
[407:13.72]Oh, all you guys.
[407:16.50]Sometimes this stream, over the course of six or seven hours, will pull like three or four hundred subs.
[407:26.30]That's fucking mind-boggling.
[407:36.94]It blows my mind every time I see it.
[407:47.51]Even if the internet's worse, Vegas still has all the stuff that I want to do.
[407:52.67]And also remember... By the way, first, thank you, all of you guys.
[407:57.80]for your either new support or continued support.
[407:59.88]It fucking means a lot.
[408:02.14]Also keep in mind, a bunch of all these streams are gonna be on location.
[408:07.00]So, you know, oh, there's internet problems here, they won't be where I am gonna be making most of these things.
[408:18.40]I'm confident that we'll have a solution here, don't worry.
[408:21.92]It will be solved.
[408:24.16]And finally here, wrapping us up, Topek, thank you for the $3.
[408:28.96]Cheering for you to stay.
[408:31.24]Oh, I'm here and I read it.
[408:32.68]I am still here.
[408:34.50]Thank you, Topek.
[408:35.14]Thank you, Yebso, for the $1.
[408:36.30]I hope I get to see you at some point at some con.
[408:38.70]Now that I know you're in the West.
[408:41.47]I'll be around.
