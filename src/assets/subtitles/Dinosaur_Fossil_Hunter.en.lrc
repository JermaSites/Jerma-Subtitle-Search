[ve:60.16.100]

[00:06.60]How you doing?
[00:09.84]I'm here!
[00:11.54]I'm here, I'm just finishing up something.
[00:16.66]Come on, don't dot dot dot me in a minute after starting the stream.
[00:20.49]I'm here!
[00:21.15]Trust me, I'm here!
[00:21.95]I also had a dream about the stream, by the way.
[00:33.91]Which is very important.
[00:41.75]I forgot.
[00:43.13]I don't remember what the context was.
[00:47.22]I don't remember what it was.
[00:48.96]Something really embarrassing happened.
[00:50.78]I was on camera, and I was sitting here playing a game or something, and the first part is gone.
[00:58.23]But the second part is I remember I was so embarrassed by something, like a really not funny joke or something like that, and I pretended to think something on stream was funny.
[01:10.34]Like, oh shit, that joke didn't go well, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, fuck, or something like that.
[01:14.48]And I just, I went like, oh my god, what do I do?
[01:16.82]What do I do?
[01:18.50]So I like, pretended to like, fall forward.
[01:21.68]And go like, oh, whoops, I fell!
[01:23.88]And I was like, on camera, you could see, like, in the monitor, like, I was like, down.
[01:29.21]Like, I'll say, I wasn't, I was off camera.
[01:31.53]And I was like, oh guys, I fell down down here!
[01:35.01]Yeah, I thought, oh man, I'm gonna have to turn the stream off, I like, fell down!
[01:38.97]And everyone said I was full of shit.
[01:45.10]Like, the chat was like, liar, like full of shit, get back on cam, liar, liar.
[01:51.43]And I thought I did a pretty good job of selling it.
[01:54.07]That like, oh, I fell down.
[01:56.57]But in my mind, I was like, this didn't... They didn't buy it.
[02:00.74]So now, I did something that people didn't like.
[02:04.68]I told a joke that people thought wasn't funny.
[02:06.50]So I tried to run away from the stream by pretending to fall down and get hurt.
[02:12.43]And that was a disaster because everyone here was like, no fucking way.
[02:15.79]Liar.
[02:17.09]So that was a double embarrassment.
[02:18.75]And I was like, what do I do now?
[02:19.95]What am I even supposed to do right now?
[02:22.91]And then I woke up.
[02:29.80]Imagine if I made a joke that was so bad that I pretended to fall out of the chair.
[02:34.92]Oh yeah, guys.
[02:35.64]I fell down out of the chair.
[02:37.12]I'm hurt.
[02:37.72]I have to leave.
[02:38.44]Anyways.
[02:44.71]Anyways.
[02:47.05]He's gonna do that this stream?
[02:49.51]No, it's funny because I have fallen out of the chair.
[02:53.16]Like two or three years ago.
[02:58.28]I fell down on stream.
[03:00.46]On the New Year's Eve stream from two years ago.
[03:03.97]And it's not like, oh, I have to turn the stream off.
[03:07.01]I was fine.
[03:17.22]Anyways, I was gonna stream yesterday, but I kind of felt like shit, if I'm honest.
[03:24.08]I still kind of have a headache.
[03:25.52]I had a bad, like, migraine-like headache yesterday.
[03:29.99]And I didn't want to turn the stream on and then in an hour just be like, sorry guys, I gotta go.
[03:33.49]Because that's happened before.
[03:35.59]So I figured I'd want to just go today if I feel better.
[03:38.17]So I do feel better.
[03:40.33]I don't want to overdo it, though.
[03:41.33]So we'll see how I feel in a few hours.
[03:45.89]So I'm imagining we'll take a look.
[03:49.29]See how I'm doing in like three to four showers right now.
[03:56.75]So I'll give you the plan.
[03:58.29]The plan is as follows.
[03:59.97]Take notes.
[04:03.54]Day one today.
[04:05.04]This week.
[04:05.70]Well, it's technically the weekend, but you know, whatever.
[04:08.16]This seven day period of, you know, I haven't streamed in two or three days.
[04:12.40]That's where we start our new period.
[04:15.17]Our new streaming period.
[04:17.31]Today we're going to do Dinosaur Fossil Hunter.
[04:20.42]For as long as I think it's fun.
[04:24.68]It looks pretty good actually.
[04:25.76]It actually looks fun.
[04:29.62]After that, at some point in the next couple days, we're going to play Later Alligator.
[04:36.71]Kind of a point and click puzzle game.
[04:39.03]Cute.
[04:39.93]Looks really cute.
[04:40.73]Looks really fun.
[04:41.31]Looks really interesting.
[04:43.98]At some point, somewhere in the middle there, or on that stream, I don't know.
[04:48.82]I'm gonna play the House of the Dead remake.
[04:52.13]That game is literally like 40 minutes, so I could probably do that at any point that I feel like it.
[05:00.33]And then, at some point this weekend, we're gonna do some horror stuff.
[05:04.82]More of those little short 1-2 hour horror games.
[05:08.02]I got Blood Wash and Murder House.
[05:13.03]That's going to be this weekend.
[05:16.21]There's your plan for the week.
[05:23.40]Excellent.
[05:23.76]Are you going to finish inscription?
[05:28.56]I am not going to finish inscription on stream.
[05:31.86]I've got to tell you something.
[05:35.30]I've played it off stream already.
[05:37.98]Yep.
[05:39.02]I already did.
[05:42.06]Sorry, guys.
[05:43.46]I did... I did get to the... I got to the third part.
[05:49.27]I have not continued since then.
[05:53.23]Without us, yeah?
[05:54.89]Well, some games... Some games I would rather do off-stream.
[06:00.28]I already... I talked about this for a little bit, but let's go over it again.
[06:03.82]A lot... Games that require a lot of focus and paying attention and... Dude, don't fuck up this hand because you're gonna have to start over.
[06:12.80]I really don't do well with those games on stream.
[06:15.48]My brain is just too... I can't.
[06:17.48]I'm just too scattered.
[06:18.74]Talking to chat.
[06:21.28]Looking over here.
[06:22.11]Looking over there.
[06:22.93]Looking over here.
[06:23.59]And then I'm like, oh shit, there's a guy... I'm playing a game.
[06:27.51]I have a lot of trouble with that.
[06:30.19]So I would rather just play those kinds of games off stream.
[06:32.29]And by the way, it was pretty cool.
[06:36.11]It was pretty cool.
[06:37.89]I haven't beat the whole thing, but I got to the third part.
[06:41.45]Okay, I'll be honest though.
[06:42.49]I gotta give you my honest what happened.
[06:45.55]I got to the third part of Inscription.
[06:48.09]And kind of went... This is fucking cool, but... I don't know if... I don't know.
[06:53.98]I don't want to do it again.
[06:56.88]Does that make sense?
[06:59.98]Does that make sense when I say that?
[07:03.97]When I say, like, I don't want to do it again, I don't mean, like, the game.
[07:09.04]I mean, like, I don't want to, like, do it again.
[07:11.46]Right?
[07:14.56]It's really cool, though.
[07:22.36]And when I say do it again, like, I don't want to, I don't want to, the game's, the game's crazy.
[07:29.39]I don't want to, like, spoil anything if anybody hasn't played it.
[07:33.91]But I'm gonna finish it.
[07:34.61]I'm- I'm- I'm- I'm- I assume that's the last or third part of the game.
[07:38.43]I don't know if there's a fourth or fifth part of the game, but I know that I'm at, like, a third portion of it.
[07:47.37]I don't wanna do it again, you know what I mean?
[07:49.11]I don't wanna do it again.
[07:50.05]That's all you need to know.
[07:51.86]Anyway, so, okay, there's your plan.
[07:53.26]Uh, for the week.
[07:56.08]Oh, also, something important that I wanna make sure everyone is aware of this, too.
[07:59.48]So... If you ever go to an arcade...
[08:03.77]There's one real... We're talking in pre-stream about this, by the way, if you don't know.
[08:07.83]If you don't know anything about this stream, I show up to my stream 10 to 20 minutes late every single time.
[08:16.86]But I'm chatting in the pre-stream chat 20 to 30 minutes before the stream starts every time.
[08:23.22]So I kind of fucked myself over in a way, because I will hang out and chat for like 20 minutes before the stream, and then I'll go get ready, and those 20 to 30 minutes is where the stream starts.
[08:36.33]So anyways, we were talking about arcades, and something that I think is really important for you to understand is that there's only one way for you to understand if you're in a real arcade or not.
[08:44.35]Forget about, like, oh, what do you mean, an arcade?
[08:45.99]No, just listen.
[08:47.65]If the arcade has the point-blank arcade cabinets,
[08:53.99]Rest assured, you're in a real arcade.
[08:57.10]You can be like, alright, I'm in a real arcade.
[09:00.28]That is the only way to tell, by the way.
[09:06.16]If they serve high-strength alcohol?
[09:14.53]What?
[09:19.19]That's my determination to determine if I'm in a real arcade or not.
[09:24.93]You're gatekeeping arcades.
[09:27.73]No, I'm just, everybody has their own version of what they consider to be like, alright, I know this is, I'm in a place where I'm going to enjoy myself.
[09:33.79]This is a real arcade for me.
[09:35.75]For me, it's point blank.
[09:37.45]For you, it might also be the X-Men arcade machine with six slots that have the six slots on it.
[09:45.39]And it's two TVs.
[09:47.56]Two big TVs are connected in the middle.
[09:50.48]To each other.
[09:51.60]And one of them is way fucking brighter than the other one.
[09:54.08]And has way more contrast.
[09:56.38]And looks wicked fucked up.
[09:57.58]I know that's probably your indicator.
[09:59.74]But I have my own indicator.
[10:06.49]That's my way to tell.
[10:07.25]Full story, bro.
[10:10.15]Mm-hmm.
[10:14.01]And don't even tell me, oh dude, no, if it has an air hockey machine, oh my god, that's a, please.
[10:20.46]An air hockey machine is how an arcade wants you to think they're a real arcade, right?
[10:25.10]They put that in there, like, yeah, dude, we got air hockey here.
[10:27.92]No, excuse me.
[10:29.53]That's like the way to make you think that it's a real arcade.
[10:39.67]What about House of the Dead?
[10:40.65]Oh, that's right, I'm gonna play House of the Dead as well.
[10:42.25]Wait, I already said that.
[10:45.27]Air hockey hater?
[10:48.69]Okay, Casino Andy.
[10:51.43]Point blank is a light gun machine from like 20 years ago.
[10:55.31]It's not a slot machine.
[10:56.55]I would understand that argument if I just told you, dude, you know what I really love in the arcades?
[11:05.78]Um, just throwing dice in the air and hoping that I get money after I do it.
[11:11.07]Huh?
[11:11.75]I said a point blank.
[11:12.67]It's a light gun game.
[11:18.00]If there's a bowling alley there, you know what?
[11:19.56]A bowling alley, I think, is... I'm not a fan of that.
[11:24.89]We could spend a lot of time doing this.
[11:25.95]I don't want to spend that much time doing this.
[11:27.01]But a bowling alley being in your arcade?
[11:30.21]That's just less room for arcade machines.
[11:35.17]In my opinion.
[11:39.34]I'm sorry.
[11:40.48]I'm sorry.
[11:40.78]That's just how I personally feel.
[11:44.61]If you've got like 20 lanes of bowling, and it's like two-thirds of your entire floor, and the rest is an arcade, oh man.
[11:54.66]You could have had point blank 1, 2, and 3.
[11:56.74]20?
[11:56.86]I don't know.
[12:04.84]What about a roller rink?
[12:09.14]What about a go-kart track?
[12:12.11]Remember, you're gaslighting a lot of people.
[12:14.59]I'm just telling you my opinions.
[12:18.69]Okay, I didn't say you have to believe this too.
[12:21.88]I just said I think, I personally, what I believe.
[12:26.74]What about a wrestling ring?
[12:27.70]That would be ridiculous.
[12:35.04]By the way, this is the music I've been listening to this whole time.
[12:40.25]I think that's why I'm so ready to tell you this.
[12:44.26]This has been blasting in both of my ears.
[12:46.02]What about laser tag?
[12:53.88]Look, laser tag is fine.
[12:55.28]Bowling alleys are fine.
[12:56.66]But if I go to the website and I look at the pictures of your floor that you have, and you do this bunch of, like, real estate angles to try to make the bathroom look bigger than it looks, right?
[13:08.47]Like, oh, here's our arcade section!
[13:10.43]And it's like, whoa, look at how big that looks!
[13:12.47]But there's, like, fucking eight machines there.
[13:16.04]No.
[13:18.02]Like, I... If you have enough cabinets...
[13:22.47]Where it's like, alright, you've got enough arcade machines, sure.
[13:25.39]Throw Bowling Alley in there if you want to.
[13:28.40]But if you call yourself an arcade and you've got like fuckin' eight arcade cabinets, I think that has to be a threshold.
[13:33.40]I'm sorry.
[13:33.82]This is the weirdest rant.
[13:42.31]It's not.
[13:44.93]This is the Jerma985 fuckin' whatever podcast.
[13:49.53]Where we just kinda talk about whatever.
[13:54.73]And it, like, zooms in on, like, the iTunes store.
[13:57.61]And it zooms in on, like, 40 reviews.
[14:02.55]And I've got, like, two and a half stars.
[14:07.17]And the podcast is, like, a hundred bucks.
[14:20.12]Whatever podcast!
[14:22.70]And the first, like, the most highly rated review or whatever is just, like... This guy didn't even talk about anything important.
[14:29.72]He got to the section where he was talking about, like, how many arcade cabinets you have to have to be, like, the threshold to be allowed to be an arcade.
[14:36.20]And I stopped listening and I requested a refund.
[14:41.72]Anyways.
[14:44.40]Put the face cam on.
[14:45.94]All you face cam andies.
[14:49.08]I didn't even tweet this, did I?
[14:53.42]Did I tweet this?
[14:56.79]I thought I did.
[14:57.33]I guess not.
[15:03.60]Okay, well, there we go.
[15:04.42]Tweet.
[15:05.14]Tweet done.
[15:05.56]I gotta use my Twitter more.
[15:11.24]It's so bad.
[15:12.44]It really is.
[15:21.28]I need to do more tweets rather than, I'm live.
[15:29.85]But like, I don't wanna, okay, I have a huge draft of tweets.
[15:34.35]I just write tweets and then I don't do, I just think that people are gonna think I'm an idiot.
[15:40.63]This, I'm gonna read you, every few months we do this, I'm gonna read you my drafts, okay?
[15:49.19]no no no stop it what what you doing my Wellington no what stop it stop you donkey what you're doing no what you do my Wellington that's the last thing I wrote down and then I don't know what this one is this one says wrestling referees are video game ai I think you probably break that one down
[16:17.17]Um, and then the next one is, I guess this is when Lost Ark came out.
[16:22.16]The only Ark I care about is Noah's Ark.
[16:25.12]Get out of my mentions and into a Bible.
[16:28.92]I don't know what that one was about.
[16:29.96]I don't know, sometimes I just write these down.
[16:41.46]But then, like, I only publish, like, going live at 6 p.m.
[16:48.84]If it makes you feel better, everyone already thinks you're an idiot.
[16:57.66]Tweet that now.
[16:59.14]That Lost Ark came out like five months ago.
[17:01.68]It's not going to be relevant at all.
[17:03.08]Maybe when there's DLC, I'll do it.
[17:12.18]Who cares?
[17:15.04]Okay, that would be like making it.
[17:17.74]It's so irrelevant.
[17:19.22]I can't.
[17:20.32]It's too irrelevant.
[17:25.17]Next game?
[17:25.77]I haven't even started playing.
[17:30.23]By the way, for a second, I thought this was like a roast beef.
[17:33.95]I forgot what game this was.
[17:35.01]I was like, oh, this guy's got like a whole pot roast here.
[17:36.92]Alright, stop it.
[17:39.10]Let's go.
[17:39.46]You guys ready?
[17:44.30]I'm gonna turn it off if you're good.
[17:46.06]Only if you guys are good.
[17:58.56]Okay, so this is a game where you go... I was gonna say you hunt dinosaurs, but that's not what you do.
[18:06.60]Pyramid Games presents Dinosaur Fossil Hunter.
[18:09.98]Okay.
[18:10.36]It's fully voice acted.
[18:12.44]By the way, the wind is fucking crazy right now.
[18:16.48]Can you hear that?
[18:18.04]It's wild right now.
[18:19.52]It's crazy here right now.
[18:21.48]Alright, I already did some of these controls.
[18:23.05]Can you hear it?
[18:29.83]It's fucked up.
[18:31.75]It actually sounds like I'm going to get blown over.
[18:37.89]Oh, happy Mother's Day to all the mothers out there.
[18:39.53]Oh, by the way, call your mother, please.
[18:41.92]Call your mother.
[18:44.72]Is that good?
[18:46.74]I gotta put both headphones in.
[18:48.08]I might want to turn it up.
[18:49.86]Bart Andy.
[18:51.72]And that guy permanently.
[18:52.52]I never want to see his fucking name ever again.
[18:55.50]For a minute.
[18:59.79]Okay, let's go.
[19:01.39]Alright, so this is my... Is this my museum?
[19:08.75]Okay.
[19:09.45]Controls.
[19:09.91]Tip panels.
[19:10.63]Prestige Roadmap.
[19:13.68]What is the Prestige Road... I can't even open it.
[19:15.72]Okay, left and right.
[19:17.96]Okay.
[19:20.38]Yo, museum.
[19:21.26]Sucks.
[19:21.88]No, it doesn't, actually.
[19:22.68]Is this T-Rex?
[19:25.10]I thought T-Rex was way bigger than this.
[19:26.99]Isn't the T-Rex like 50 feet tall?
[19:35.91]Cool.
[19:36.07]Cool.
[19:38.69]It's 50 feet tall.
[19:45.87]Okay, so I think this is where I gotta go.
[19:47.12]Museum Workshop.
[19:49.00]Okay, I think this is probably a tutorial.
[19:53.76]Platinum Patron of Science, Kendra.
[19:56.96]Gold Patron of Science, Jack Renshaw.
[20:00.87]This is... Alright.
[20:04.48]Oh, I thought I had to do this.
[20:14.85]I was like, this is not the game I thought it was going to be.
[20:18.21]Oh, I do have to do this.
[20:22.87]Alright, let's go for it.
[20:23.87]Give me the pencil.
[20:46.48]Oh shit.
[20:56.42]Honestly, I'm telling you right now, this is, this is, this is, this kid's ready for upper management.
[21:05.02]It's just like, oh yeah, it's just like these, these little dot to dot puzzles.
[21:08.58]It's just to bore, bore your child.
[21:10.88]Okay, is that good?
[21:15.31]I got it.
[21:19.78]Is that it?
[21:26.83]Oh, that's it.
[21:27.21]Okay, next drawing.
[21:32.87]You missed the front leg?
[21:33.97]I was just coloring it in.
[21:35.73]Okay, next drawing.
[21:41.64]New draw.
[21:44.76]What?
[21:46.32]Oh no, I have to do it again?
[21:51.17]Okay, wait, I can... Oh, next one.
[21:55.30]Alright, hold on.
[21:56.64]So let me do it right.
[21:57.34]Let me actually do it right.
[22:14.83]you
[22:45.58]Why do I feel like kids in school, like, probably do this stuff?
[22:54.72]You know, like, sometimes you just look over and you see, like, hey, come sub to my Twitch!
[23:00.66]Like, hey, you can find me over here at Twitch.
[23:02.31]I feel like kids probably do this.
[23:10.15]Oh, like, they're, like, Twitterer.
[23:15.11]What kid has a Twitter?
[23:17.25]Do kids have Twitter?
[23:18.43]They shouldn't?
[23:19.77]They shouldn't?
[23:20.80]Do they?
[23:21.14]No, they don't.
[23:25.50]Do they?
[23:27.68]Kids don't have Twitter.
[23:29.52]I hope they don't.
[23:32.24]I missed these dots.
[23:33.26]I'll get it.
[23:36.45]Alright, continue.
[23:41.11]It was one of the most exciting days in my life.
[23:45.20]When I was eight, I found my first fossil.
[23:50.40]What the fuck?
[23:53.13]What am I doing out here?
[24:00.81]Oh, there's a sprint?
[24:03.14]Wait, I'm supposed to be eight years old right now?
[24:13.86]Where's my supervision?
[24:19.37]Okay, right... Left mouse button, pick up and inspect.
[24:24.61]Right is drop or hold to throw.
[24:29.09]Alright, I found my first fossil here.
[24:36.32]What are all the car sounds?
[24:39.48]Okay, I'm just in my backyard, right?
[24:41.24]And I'm just like, it's imagination time.
[24:43.48]I'm imagining all of this.
[24:44.62]Okay.
[24:55.27]Holy shit, that's why we're at like $50,000.
[24:56.87]Okay, so this is, I can rotate it.
[25:00.57]I can rotate it.
[25:03.67]Oh, no I can't.
[25:05.45]I lost it half a year later.
[25:08.70]I mean, lost it.
[25:09.32]At the age of 14, nearly all I could think about was putting together and painting dinosaur models.
[25:15.92]I was getting better at it.
[25:17.80]Alright, this kid got into the wood stain and did this.
[25:20.99]Like, excuse me.
[25:22.83]Like, where did you get the stain to do that?
[25:24.97]This one comes with a manual.
[25:26.29]It's dead simple.
[25:28.87]This one comes with a manual.
[25:29.61]Alright, hold on.
[25:30.05]Let me do a little bit of grease action here.
[25:40.37]14.
[25:40.39]Alright, so here we go.
[25:52.71]I get to do this.
[25:54.49]Oh, this is cool.
[25:57.00]Rotate.
[25:58.92]Pick up part.
[26:00.04]Drop part.
[26:01.24]Okay, so I just have to go this way.
[26:02.42]Alright, so here we go.
[26:03.18]I got like a... This is easy.
[26:09.52]No, pick it up.
[26:12.01]That's a great sound effect, by the way.
[26:13.49]Why is my nose so itchy?
[26:27.54]Ooh, alright, so I got a brontosaurus.
[26:32.48]This one's tougher.
[26:34.12]There's no manual, but I have the sketch at least.
[26:41.73]Oh, fuck.
[26:42.43]Okay.
[26:44.26]Can I, like, spin this around?
[26:46.86]Alright, well, very obviously this is here.
[26:50.58]What if I don't have the drawing?
[27:05.61]Yeah, easy.
[27:09.17]Easy.
[27:11.14]Do I get to paint it too?
[27:15.10]Why does this 10 year old have a voice like that?
[27:16.62]He's remembering.
[27:17.54]He's reminiscing.
[27:18.42]Uh oh.
[27:18.90]Okay, well this is definitely where the head goes.
[27:34.56]Oh, I can rotate it.
[27:35.72]Alright, so this is where the head goes.
[27:38.70]These are the arms?
[27:47.23]This is the tail.
[27:47.81]Alright, this is the big part of the tail.
[27:55.37]Yep.
[27:58.60]No, that didn't work.
[28:00.72]Let me just do all the stuff I know where it goes first.
[28:02.62]Okay.
[28:08.91]This is a leg.
[28:15.30]That's like, there's like a thigh.
[28:16.66]There's a foot.
[28:18.79]Wrong way.
[28:19.23]Alright, now this is tough.
[28:24.91]I don't know.
[28:25.31]Like this?
[28:25.63]Yeah.
[28:33.20]Okay, keep going.
[28:34.90]This is like a Life is Strange soundtrack.
[28:43.54]There you go.
[28:44.90]Is that right?
[28:45.32]Yeah, I got it.
[28:47.94]I'm good.
[28:54.49]Maybe I could use more practice and build one of them again.
[28:59.41]Let's see.
[29:00.89]What difficulty level should I- I don't need to do that.
[29:03.07]I know what I'm doing.
[29:07.16]A couple of years later, the money I had received as a reward in that competition turned out to be of an invaluable help.
[29:15.97]I got some money?
[29:16.61]Adventure of a lifetime in your 20s?
[29:21.23]Well, I think it's possible.
[29:24.51]I was exactly 20 years old when I found an article about a paleontological group in a newspaper.
[29:30.39]Turned out they needed volunteers who were willing to work in the north of the country.
[29:34.81]It was a long shot, but I didn't want to miss such a great opportunity.
[29:38.23]Oh, for some reason I thought dinosaurs existed in this world.
[29:41.14]As you probably imagine, it paid off.
[29:43.62]You see like the front page, like front page of the news, man, like the T-Rex is back.
[29:48.72]Stay in your house.
[29:51.56]What would what would people do?
[29:55.57]If there was a front page on like number one on Reddit, like top of Reddit, top of every news website, CNN, Fox News, ABC, if it was like T-Rex is back.
[30:08.04]What would happen?
[30:11.19]And it was like a big roaring T-Rex.
[30:13.09]Like, that's, like, there are pictures of it.
[30:18.80]On Reddit?
[30:19.26]I don't know.
[30:22.32]Okay, Gameplay Basics.
[30:24.38]Would you, like, leave your house?
[30:27.88]Like, front, the top, the front page of Reddit.
[30:30.88]Over 50 T-Rexes have been spotted in various cities across America.
[30:35.94]Are you gonna leave?
[30:36.56]Are you gonna, like, leave?
[30:39.28]What do you do?
[30:40.70]I think I'd be scared.
[30:41.56]Okay, gameplay tips.
[30:46.51]Important interactive objects.
[30:48.25]Let's just go over this real quick.
[30:50.11]You know it's a video?
[30:50.89]I'm going to give the dev a plus one faux letter grade.
[30:55.54]You just show me.
[30:56.94]Just show me.
[30:57.92]Show me.
[30:58.96]Don't tell me.
[30:59.48]Show me.
[31:01.36]Yep.
[31:03.03]Gameplay tips, upper right corner.
[31:05.17]Read them on the tablet.
[31:06.39]Okay.
[31:07.63]F1.
[31:08.22]Got it.
[31:08.98]Look at this.
[31:09.98]Absolutely perfect tutorial.
[31:15.24]What about this one?
[31:17.44]Important object display description in the lower left corner.
[31:20.08]Okay.
[31:20.36]Look at this.
[31:20.94]Honestly, like I'm not kidding.
[31:22.00]This is like a perfect tutorial.
[31:26.42]Okay.
[31:26.66]Third hint will be in the color of the pointer.
[31:28.11]Okay.
[31:28.39]So yeah, just like this information on the bottom.
[31:31.25]Easy.
[31:33.23]Icons on the compass hide with growing distance.
[31:35.77]Okay.
[31:36.65]Just like that.
[31:38.39]On the map on your tablet, you can select an object or place that where you want to go.
[31:42.72]Alright.
[31:44.68]This would have taken a AAA game like three hours to tell me this stuff.
[31:48.90]Okay, then when you unlock new locations, use the travel tab on your tablet to move to another location.
[31:53.45]Good.
[31:55.81]Okay, so it's like right there.
[31:59.82]Time of day, you can select the time of day, car you want to... Cars are in this game?
[32:04.41]You just got two full letter grades in one minute.
[32:07.85]If all of you said this game was like a C, it just became an A-, just because of the last 15 seconds.
[32:15.05]Okay, so cool.
[32:16.73]Let's go.
[32:21.33]So I drive around, I got my tablet.
[32:25.75]Welcome to the mining area.
[32:26.79]A few weeks ago, miners came across something that appears to be dinosaur remains.
[32:32.03]We managed to get the mine closed until the matter is dealt with, as neither the workers nor the board of directors is happy about the lockdown.
[32:38.38]Okay, we gotta act fast.
[32:42.06]Your job is relatively easy.
[32:43.00]Head to the area marked on your map and leave no stone unturned.
[32:46.69]The area is marked on your radar as well, so you shouldn't have any problems finding it.
[32:50.75]The off-road car parked nearby is fueled and ready.
[32:52.79]We hope your work will be fruitful.
[32:54.71]With your help, we should be able to finally complete the full skeleton for our new museum.
[33:00.13]That's a fun one to say when you do like the radio voice.
[33:02.89]The missing bones that we're looking for are a hip bone, right arm bone, and a vertebra.
[33:09.05]Alright, let's go.
[33:11.03]Let's go.
[33:11.35]It turns up a little bit.
[33:13.23]It's not that loud.
[33:17.44]Okay, so I've got some tools.
[33:19.88]This is my flashlight.
[33:20.84]I've got a drone.
[33:21.54]Does this have gas?
[33:36.99]How do I get out of here?
[33:42.26]Okay, let's go.
[33:45.70]Do I need to go... where on the map?
[33:53.06]2x4?
[33:53.38]4x4?
[33:53.60]Why do I have a bunch of moving stuff?
[33:58.48]Alright, use the horn.
[33:59.98]Nice!
[34:00.40]This isn't music.
[34:06.60]Okay, so where am I going?
[34:08.64]Where's the map?
[34:09.62]Okay, I gotta go over there on the right.
[34:10.94]Alright, so turn around.
[34:15.39]Do they have, like, a street?
[34:18.87]Alright, you can go kind of fast.
[34:22.68]Uh-oh.
[34:25.44]It's like, wait!
[34:26.98]Don't go so fast!
[34:29.12]Hold on.
[34:31.04]Removing obstacles.
[34:33.14]Remove lying tree trunks with a chainsaw and use sledgehammer to break rocks.
[34:38.39]Note the color of the interactive cursor when using tools.
[34:40.39]When it is green, you can work.
[34:41.97]Ooh, can I find stuff in there?
[34:45.49]If you find someone in a place you can't get out of, use R to reset your character.
[34:48.94]I think I'm about to be in that part.
[34:52.42]There's an excavation equipment in your car.
[34:54.72]After using it to secure the excavation area, you'll need to get another set of equipment from the hub.
[35:00.08]Don't forget about this when you go on your next fossil site search.
[35:03.11]In hard to reach and muddy terrain, use the 4x4 drive.
[35:09.13]You can reset the car by pressing R too.
[35:11.01]Alright.
[35:13.62]Like, I just hit his head.
[35:18.98]Like, I'm dead.
[35:19.66]It's over.
[35:24.50]That's it.
[35:26.76]Alright, I gotta do this, right?
[35:28.88]Did I get my sledgehammer?
[35:36.64]Cool.
[35:39.83]Alright, so how do I get this out of the way?
[35:41.49]Just gonna pick it up?
[35:49.24]Do I have to keep cutting it?
[35:49.96]How many pieces do I need?
[35:51.08]Can I just drive over it?
[36:07.01]How do I pick it up?
[36:08.59]Oh, there we go.
[36:15.59]Nobody else works here, right?
[36:22.57]Imagine if I just shattered the windshield.
[36:23.71]Alright, don't do that with any bones.
[36:29.09]That would be bad, right?
[36:32.57]This- I love this music.
[36:33.97]It's so... Like, epic.
[36:35.89]Okay, so I gotta go that way.
[36:40.26]There's the dig site.
[36:40.90]Alright, put it in 4x4.
[36:43.82]Yeah, 4-wheel drive.
[37:02.35]Alright, I can't go that way.
[37:04.33]Maybe I can.
[37:12.11]You see, they never show this in the car commercials, because this is what fucking happens if you were to do this.
[37:26.14]R. That didn't do anything!
[37:36.16]Okay, there we go.
[37:37.78]Four-wheel drive.
[37:46.51]Get through the mud.
[37:47.25]Get out and push the car.
[37:50.75]I'm fine.
[37:51.23]Alright, back into two-wheel drive.
[37:55.36]Let's go.
[38:04.62]Use a hammer.
[38:05.16]Alright.
[38:06.24]Car need to have all wheels grounded together.
[38:08.04]Oh, I thought the other wheels were all gone.
[38:09.48]Is this a big cheese?
[38:20.98]It kind of is like a big piece of cheese, isn't it?
[38:26.32]How strong is this guy?
[38:28.02]Oh no, fucking way.
[38:29.44]Hercules couldn't even do that in the movie.
[38:35.35]That would be so funny if there was sound effects.
[38:38.86]It was like... I definitely cannot pick this one up.
[38:48.58]Too big?
[38:51.83]Make your own sounds.
[38:56.69]I can, okay, I don't, I can get out of this.
[39:00.91]Is there any valuables here too?
[39:02.37]Like, can I like, sift for gold?
[39:14.33]Okay, here we go.
[39:15.83]We're here.
[39:16.17]Now I gotta get out, and I've gotta do some excavation.
[39:26.56]Oh, it's this way.
[39:27.92]Okay.
[39:32.92]Is it near the tree?
[39:33.67]Alright, somewhere over here.
[39:40.03]Bring your car... Oh.
[39:41.33]Oh.
[39:43.84]Is it just like Minecraft?
[39:45.96]Not really.
[39:46.40]This is Dinosaur Poop Simulator.
[39:51.43]I don't think you can... Dinosaur Poop didn't fossilize.
[39:56.39]Wasn't it absorbed into the fucking ground?
[40:04.14]Is it?
[40:07.96]Okay, here we go.
[40:08.54]So.
[40:15.22]Oh, I have to park there.
[40:21.08]Secure the area.
[40:26.65]Oh, it's just doing it.
[40:27.89]This is funny.
[40:37.07]Where's he going?
[40:40.36]Oh, just... Should I skip it?
[40:43.92]Dude, I'm sorry.
[40:44.36]This game blows.
[40:45.94]You don't... It's... I can tell you... I can tell you about these, like... These, like, five-minute Andes.
[40:51.78]Okay?
[40:54.72]It's... It's been, like, 15... It hasn't even been 15 minutes.
[40:59.58]You should play a different... No!
[41:00.90]Stop!
[41:06.84]How... Wait.
[41:07.70]How big is this area?
[41:11.86]Oh, okay.
[41:12.74]Well...
[41:14.58]play checkers no checkers sucks okay here we go it does check okay checkers look I don't like chess either
[41:32.26]I'm gonna, it's not, look, I think, look, checkers is not a bad game, but checkers, chess, any game where I have to sit down, like, across somebody, and move little pieces on, like, a game board and go against somebody else, I don't care.
[41:49.33]It bores the absolute fuck out of me.
[41:51.95]I would rather, like, just go, like, roll down a hill, you know what I mean?
[41:55.15]I don't wanna, look, I don't wanna play chess, I wanna, like, roll down the hill.
[42:02.17]I don't, like, want to play chess.
[42:04.23]Hey, let's play chess, dude.
[42:05.71]Oh, just, like, please.
[42:07.15]Like, I want to do anything else.
[42:08.03]Anything but chess.
[42:08.79]Anything but checkers or chess.
[42:11.11]I know there's some, like, really, like, high-brained people that get a lot of enjoyment from that shit.
[42:15.93]You're really analytical, and you like problem-solving and stuff, and that's awesome.
[42:20.01]That's really cool.
[42:21.11]I'm glad you have the capability to do that.
[42:22.59]I just want to roll down a hill.
[42:26.49]I don't... I've always tried... My brother was into chess.
[42:31.72]and he really wanted somebody to play with and he would just checkmate me every fucking 10 seconds like he was just trying to find someone to play with and he'd be like hey man let's you want to play chess I was like yeah and I would just sit there and I would just I only the only thing I knew what to do in chess was move the pawns
[42:56.12]I didn't know how to do anything else.
[42:57.13]So he would just, I would move my pawns up, sometimes two spaces, sometimes one for no reason.
[43:02.97]And he would be like, and checkmate me in like five minutes.
[43:07.41]This happened every time.
[43:10.20]I kind of feel bad looking back because he really did just really want to play, and like the internet didn't exist, right?
[43:18.12]So you couldn't just like, oh, go play chess against like a computer.
[43:22.36]Right now, losing viewers.
[43:24.43]Good.
[43:25.35]Right now,
[43:27.40]You can open up any app, any website.
[43:31.53]You can literally go play chess right now in literally five seconds from right now.
[43:38.11]I kind of feel bad for the people that really wanted to do that kind of stuff, but they just didn't have any access to it.
[43:48.71]Alright.
[43:49.75]There's your story.
[43:51.81]In the excavation area, use the GPR to find the stones hidden underground.
[43:56.34]Ooh.
[43:58.54]Okay.
[44:01.31]Dig in the soil and sand with a shovel.
[44:03.65]Pay attention to the color of the cursor.
[44:06.07]That indicates where you can use the tool.
[44:07.65]Alright.
[44:08.61]So you gotta find the rock.
[44:10.27]Dig.
[44:13.07]Use the pickaxe to search the rocky ground.
[44:14.88]Pay attention to the color of the cursor.
[44:16.20]That indicates where you can use the tool.
[44:18.08]Sick.
[44:20.52]Visual inspection at this stage will help you identify stones of other geologic periods.
[44:24.62]You can remove them quickly.
[44:26.30]Let's go.
[44:31.62]I love stories, people happy.
[44:35.46]Losing viewers equals spinning out the week.
[44:44.41]Did you hear that noise?
[44:45.19]That was like a... Okay, grab a pallet.
[44:49.05]What do I do with this?
[44:56.57]Oh, there's no fossils in here.
[44:57.61]Okay, I get it.
[45:01.43]Alright, here we go.
[45:03.02]Now we open up the machine.
[45:06.16]That is this thing here.
[45:07.56]Alright.
[45:10.76]Find a good place for exploration and scan it.
[45:13.63]Alright, scanning.
[45:14.25]Is it on the map?
[45:18.29]No, just somewhere here.
[45:25.10]Scanning.
[45:30.85]This is a bunch of bullshit.
[45:31.93]What's gonna happen is that somebody told me to come out here and do this.
[45:36.65]There's nothing, there's not gonna be anything here.
[45:39.95]This is like this way, somebody wanted to get rid of me for a few hours.
[45:45.77]All of a sudden, like, all the sprinkler system's gonna turn on.
[45:49.57]And just get me, like, soaking wet.
[45:52.90]And I'm gonna be like, fucking pieces of shit.
[45:57.72]Is this not right?
[46:02.24]Yeah, Dave, go there and go look for dinosaur bones.
[46:06.46]Where?
[46:06.72]There's nothing here.
[46:07.36]How do I scan?
[46:15.24]I just go out here.
[46:17.20]There's nothing in this place.
[46:26.87]Please, please flag.
[46:31.21]Where is this place?
[46:35.58]Go to the dirt mound?
[46:36.74]Oh my god.
[46:37.66]What?
[46:38.32]Everything's a dirt mound.
[46:39.10]This whole thing is a dirt mound.
[46:44.46]Oh, you mean this.
[46:45.18]You mean the fresh dirt.
[46:47.24]Alright, whatever.
[46:47.92]That looks pretty good.
[46:58.34]Oh!
[46:58.48]Alright, mark these two spots.
[47:09.30]Boop!
[47:10.80]Market here.
[47:11.28]Right here.
[47:16.56]Okay.
[47:23.32]There's a lot of fossils here.
[47:24.52]What about over there?
[47:33.12]No?
[47:36.25]What's your guys' favorite dinosaur?
[47:41.06]Mine's the chicken.
[47:48.16]Look it up.
[47:50.00]Alright, I think I got enough.
[47:57.16]So now I gotta dig at these spots.
[48:10.59]How far down do I go?
[48:11.45]Oh, I got it.
[48:23.18]Oh, shit.
[48:23.54]I can't move.
[48:28.75]I gotta get rid of this crap.
[48:29.79]Alright.
[48:30.63]Okay.
[48:30.99]Be careful.
[48:36.27]I gotta dig that out.
[48:37.19]Can I get it?
[48:43.75]Can I just pull it out?
[48:44.37]I put the chainsaw away.
[48:48.39]How do I get this out?
[48:49.31]Dude, there's probably like 10 dinosaur bones in here.
[49:01.19]Okay, I get it.
[49:08.66]Can I pick it up?
[49:15.88]find first inspect the stone how do I inspect it dude stop digging hold on how do I inspect this inspect the stone how do I do that pick up use inspect right that's what I'm trying to do I need to do more pickaxe
[49:47.95]Oh, shit.
[49:52.43]Alright, here we go.
[49:57.71]That was a bad one.
[49:58.35]That was not a funny one.
[49:59.87]I'll do it again.
[50:00.81]I'll do it better.
[50:04.68]That one was not as good either.
[50:05.48]I'll try it one more time.
[50:07.25]Oh, this, wait, radiation?
[50:09.77]That was a good one.
[50:10.91]Use that one instead.
[50:11.86]That was actually a pretty good one.
[50:13.56]The first two were fucking cringe and awful.
[50:15.66]Alright, this allows us to use the Geiger counter to search for them.
[50:18.66]It will be indicated.
[50:19.42]Alright, cool.
[50:22.04]None of those, that third one was fine.
[50:24.72]Use a towel to remove mud from the stone.
[50:26.42]Okay.
[50:29.40]And then we can identify the species.
[50:34.40]This is cool.
[50:38.21]This is cool.
[50:38.75]Alright, let's go.
[50:42.11]I said bunka-esque the first time.
[50:44.27]Fringe.
[50:47.41]There's no bones in this rock?
[50:55.69]I can't get out of here.
[50:56.39]Hold on.
[50:56.55]What do you mean there's no bones in this rock?
[51:01.57]Oh!
[51:02.05]There are fossils in that little one.
[51:06.35]You need boneless rocks.
[51:08.23]You don't want to have... You want boneless buffalo rocks?
[51:17.03]That's so stupid.
[51:18.43]I love it.
[51:18.93]Okay.
[51:21.96]Prepare for transport.
[51:23.00]Use plaster to protect fragile fossils.
[51:25.28]This is so much... This is cool.
[51:33.78]You have to pack it into a place to plaster stone in a shipping crate.
[51:38.38]Okay, and then you see, put it into a crate.
[51:42.58]You gotta bring the necessary amount of crates.
[51:45.71]And then... Place the boxes with the fossils in your car and transport them to the hub.
[51:52.91]Transport... That small chest can be transported by passenger cars.
[51:56.83]For large, you need a truck, okay?
[52:02.85]Archipelago?
[52:03.41]Okay.
[52:03.85]I got it.
[52:06.90]Big money!
[52:08.86]Can't move though.
[52:16.58]I can't get... I'm stuck.
[52:20.92]I can't move.
[52:21.39]It's R, right?
[52:26.07]I can't get unstuck.
[52:27.91]R. R.
[52:34.57]Get me the fuck out of here.
[52:35.33]Alright, I'm good.
[52:48.65]But I need to check the other ones too.
[52:54.53]Why did I not bring a step ladder?
[53:05.51]Okay, I gotta make a path.
[53:06.79]Where do I put that?
[53:09.25]Let me do the thing with this.
[53:11.33]This one right here, right?
[53:12.03]Alright, this is it.
[53:15.80]So let's look at it.
[53:21.18]Okay, yep, there's bones in there.
[53:22.40]Cluster it up.
[53:24.82]Make sure we keep it safe.
[53:37.25]I got a message.
[53:40.41]Evacuation.
[53:41.27]Oh, never mind.
[53:43.19]Yeah, it's been secured.
[53:44.90]Yep.
[53:46.60]Transport it.
[53:47.04]Okay, yep.
[53:50.16]Okay.
[53:51.18]Now I gotta put this in a box?
[53:52.26]Over here.
[53:57.72]Why are you putting a cast on it?
[53:58.84]Okay, yes.
[54:03.03]Okay.
[54:04.31]Unknown species.
[54:05.31]Unknown bone.
[54:06.35]How many can I fit in here?
[54:14.65]Oh my god, what the hell was that sound?
[54:16.27]That scared the shit out of me.
[54:17.17]Okay.
[54:25.92]Wait, there's more stones.
[54:28.70]I can fit one more in there.
[54:37.08]Alright, this is fun.
[54:38.15]I want to do this more.
[54:41.26]Give me my, uh, this thing.
[54:43.86]Can I eventually get a bigger car?
[54:47.10]Where are all my markers?
[54:48.62]Oh.
[54:48.70]Dude, you should hit that Yankee Spelunky.
[54:54.24]You got it, man.
[55:10.74]Alright, let me clear this out because I don't want to get stuck like I just did.
[55:15.04]Dude, we missed you.
[55:15.82]I haven't gone anywhere.
[55:20.41]What, because I haven't hit the Yoinkie Sploinkie in like seven months?
[55:27.03]You know, there's other dances besides the Yoinkie Sploinkie, right?
[55:29.75]You know that there's other things.
[55:30.67]There's other movements you can do with your body.
[55:32.63]You know that, right?
[55:36.59]Is that a fossil?
[55:37.13]I don't know.
[55:41.03]Okay, there was another one here.
[55:42.01]Where is it?
[55:42.57]Let me check these.
[55:48.62]Does this have any fossils in it?
[55:49.72]That's passive aggressive Andy right there.
[55:56.64]Oh, that's fine.
[56:03.76]What you said was fine.
[56:05.72]What you said is fine.
[56:06.36]That's fine.
[56:07.36]That's okay.
[56:09.25]Sure.
[56:17.59]Oh, that's fine.
[56:18.03]Whatever you say.
[56:19.95]No dinosaur bones in there.
[56:21.71]Oh, whatever.
[56:22.25]Alright, there's other ones here.
[56:33.80]Oh.
[56:37.50]Oh.
[56:39.10]Oh.
[56:40.93]Isn't this when the guy flies in Avatar?
[56:50.53]Alright, let's identify these.
[56:51.47]Dig that up.
[57:03.22]There's gotta be one in here, right?
[57:04.36]Get that out of here.
[57:08.10]Excuse me.
[57:12.26]Get this out of here.
[57:12.80]I don't want to confuse you with another one.
[57:14.20]I'm just out.
[57:19.73]He's gone.
[57:21.53]Look at the CCTV footage.
[57:25.63]Why did he do that?
[57:27.16]Why would he do that?
[57:28.28]What was he doing?
[57:45.54]Alright, let's take a look.
[57:49.08]Nope.
[57:51.08]Nope.
[57:53.54]Three in a row?
[57:54.26]What about this one?
[57:57.42]Bingo.
[57:58.50]Alright, get this shit out of here.
[58:06.33]Break this one up.
[58:12.27]Good.
[58:12.59]Get rid of it.
[58:13.29]See you later.
[58:13.79]Alright.
[58:14.17]So what's in here?
[58:15.85]We got two stones now.
[58:22.97]Alright.
[58:24.29]I have to be honest with you.
[58:25.06]Turn off the music.
[58:27.12]Not yet.
[58:27.60]Not until I'm sick of it.
[58:29.04]The first like 20 minutes of this game, I thought we're going to be just like a piece of shit.
[58:35.14]I am over the last like 30 minutes have slowly been going.
[58:37.72]This is actually going to be probably pretty cool.
[58:40.28]This is actually going to be kind of fun.
[58:43.69]Like, I was like, this could be, I don't know if I'm gonna like this.
[58:45.77]I think I'm actually gonna really like this, especially when you start, like, painting the dinosaur bones and stuff.
[58:54.25]This looks like cornbread.
[59:06.34]Can I, wait, I can do three.
[59:12.12]I can put one on top too.
[59:13.26]Alright, I'm going to get another one.
[59:19.10]One can go up top.
[59:19.88]Alright, let's keep this one area here.
[59:33.85]Ah, we got it.
[59:41.00]Please turn the music off.
[59:42.00]I'll just wait.
[59:43.40]You know what?
[59:44.02]This is making me, like, into it for a minute.
[59:46.46]I'll get bored of it in, like, 15 more minutes.
[59:48.73]Trust me.
[59:49.13]Don't worry.
[59:53.59]Can I get rid of this?
[59:59.77]There's some shit right here.
[60:05.62]This one... What is even down here?
[60:11.53]Alright, let's see.
[60:16.55]Do any of these have anything in it?
[60:22.91]Get that out of here.
[60:28.02]Nothing?
[60:29.50]What the fuck are you talking about?
[60:34.50]Oh, there's nothing here at all!
[60:36.14]I did this at... Okay, I'm an idiot.
[60:38.12]Where's the... Oh, over there.
[60:42.35]There's nothing there.
[60:51.95]How come you like boring games?
[60:57.51]Not everything has to have, like, machine gun fire.
[61:01.29]Okay?
[61:04.77]Not every game needs to have machine gun fire.
[61:09.31]Okay?
[61:11.11]Every video game does not have to have... It doesn't have to have it.
[61:18.48]It can be an enjoyable experience.
[61:25.38]Plus, I'm a boring fucking person.
[61:27.54]So, there.
[61:28.56]There's your answer.
[61:42.71]Dude, those of you that- Dude, oh, wow, like... I wonder what his life is like when he's not streaming.
[61:48.96]I am a boring fucking guy, okay?
[61:51.46]Um... I think it was last night I fell asleep.
[61:56.12]I had my iPad.
[61:57.68]And I fell asleep to- This is, like, kind of crazy, man.
[61:59.90]This is why I had, like, a nightmare.
[62:02.47]I was watching a showcase, like, a Halloween convention showcase where they show all, like, the animatronics and shit.
[62:08.45]And I fell asleep to it and it autoplayed, like, five years of their convention.
[62:16.20]Like, if you scroll through these videos, it's like the biggest Halloween convention or something.
[62:22.82]And it's like a huge thing.
[62:24.78]And they showcase all the new animatronics and Halloween scary stuff, right?
[62:31.79]And I'm just sitting there doing like this, just like... I'm not doing anything else, right?
[62:40.58]But if you scroll through, it was like five straight years of their convention and people going to it.
[62:45.74]Like, hours of videos.
[62:47.78]And I shit you not, almost every 10 to 15 seconds, you hear... It's like this fucking face peeled off zombie going like this.
[63:06.44]It was literally the whole video.
[63:12.85]And I was- I fell- I slept to that.
[63:18.29]Was this- was anything in here?
[63:26.52]They all do that too.
[63:29.66]When do you- okay.
[63:31.48]The- I- all those like crazy animatronics, they all do that like really strange like movements.
[63:39.50]It's just so unsettling.
[63:40.80]It's so scary.
[63:43.56]And I'll make this reference to you, too.
[63:46.95]Animatronics... Like the Halloween ones, where it's like the ghoul that moves and just kind of goes at you.
[63:54.13]It reminds me of Dark Souls enemies.
[63:56.17]They're just these mindless, brainless things that just... I'm getting you now.
[64:01.88]Like, here I come!
[64:03.78]That's why Dark Souls is so scary.
[64:06.34]We talked about that when I was playing Elden Ring.
[64:08.16]But all the FromSoftware AI...
[64:11.60]It's just... I'm killing you.
[64:14.30]I'm killing you.
[64:15.56]I don't care about anything else.
[64:16.70]I don't give a shit about anything else.
[64:18.70]My programming is just get that fucking guy right now.
[64:22.52]It doesn't... There is no like... Oh, he's running?
[64:25.35]Back off a little.
[64:26.31]No, it's just... Until I get you.
[64:32.33]It's horrifying.
[64:33.55]It's like a nightmare.
[64:34.37]It's a dream.
[64:35.51]That's why those things are so scary.
[64:39.31]They just don't stop.
[64:39.81]That's why Michael Myers was scary.
[64:42.67]Michael Myers didn't do anything.
[64:45.23]Like, I could probably sprint punch Michael Myers in the face and knock him out and he'd be dead.
[64:50.20]You know what I mean?
[64:50.64]Like, I could probably, like, full sprint fucking smash him in the head.
[64:55.08]Like, right here.
[64:56.38]He'd just be like... But, and it would take one punch and he's right here.
[65:02.00]And his head would explode.
[65:03.26]I'm telling you, his head would explode.
[65:07.11]But no, because he just walks forward and has no emotion, he just has an AI that's like, go get that person, just walk at them.
[65:16.54]That's why it was just, holy shit, what the fuck, this is terrifying.
[65:18.66]Anything in this one?
[65:28.50]Alright, where was I digging?
[65:29.34]I completely forgot.
[65:30.06]We started talking about Halloween stuff.
[65:31.60]But yeah, I was sleeping to that.
[65:33.12]It is every 15 seconds.
[65:34.36]You're just screaming.
[65:36.59]No wonder I had a fucking nightmare.
[65:38.87]I gotta turn autoplay off, man.
[65:40.65]It's seriously... But I always just forget to.
[65:46.29]Because I'm logged in.
[65:51.14]How many pieces of furniture do you have?
[65:52.36]I don't know, like five?
[65:54.90]I have a chair.
[65:59.01]Two chairs, I think.
[66:00.70]Table?
[66:01.38]I don't know.
[66:01.96]I got five pieces of furniture, maybe?
[66:09.82]Fuck.
[66:11.34]Oh my god!
[66:17.87]I said this was gonna be a chill stream.
[66:19.83]I say that every time, and then I just, I don't know, I'm like fucked up.
[66:24.17]I'm gonna give myself another headache, like I had yesterday.
[66:26.55]Alright, let's get this sealed up.
[66:33.52]You need to inspect it first.
[66:35.70]Oh shit, I'm not inspecting it.
[66:37.04]That's right.
[66:41.11]Perform a visual inspection.
[66:48.15]Oh fuck, I like plastered those without knowing what it was!
[66:56.77]Well, Jerry, you found these fossils, but you mummified them.
[67:02.84]And we're never going to know what they are.
[67:04.70]Thanks.
[67:09.46]Okay, well, I know what it is.
[67:10.47]Are there any more?
[67:10.95]Alright, I get it now.
[67:14.11]Next time I'll be out there.
[67:15.03]So this is a head?
[67:16.51]Like a skull?
[67:17.01]A skull?
[67:30.37]this music uh this is this this song is called the river doth flow uh by I forget the artist but it's the river oops the river the river doth flow
[67:57.92]I have no idea.
[67:59.70]Okay, so I did it.
[68:01.20]Now I gotta get out of here.
[68:01.92]I gotta go back to the, um, campsite.
[68:06.41]I probably should actually be careful.
[68:07.29]You can probably dump this.
[68:09.01]I'm gonna do the right thing.
[68:12.41]There's no way in fuck you know what the word doth means.
[68:15.44]It means does.
[68:16.66]Or do.
[68:30.47]How's that wrong?
[68:37.15]Yeah, like whether thou doth go or not.
[68:40.26]Whether you will go or do or not.
[68:46.42]To be or not to be.
[68:49.40]Thou doth, the question.
[68:54.74]Don't crash into a rock.
[69:09.12]What does it actually mean, then?
[69:10.19]How's it wrong?
[69:10.77]What does it actually mean?
[69:11.93]What does Doth mean?
[69:12.69]Doesn't it mean, like, to do?
[69:14.39]Like, to go?
[69:15.15]Like, Doth.
[69:15.67]Like, to do.
[69:16.55]Does.
[69:23.89]It does.
[69:24.23]Yeah, what are you talking about?
[69:25.05]Don't make me seem like I'm an idiot.
[69:26.21]Listen to this music.
[69:29.82]This music got cooler.
[69:38.63]Can I put this down and open it up and see what's in there?
[69:41.57]How do I open this?
[69:42.11]I can't open it.
[69:49.93]Unknown species.
[69:54.01]Just throw it over there?
[69:55.01]No, I can't.
[70:01.23]Alright.
[70:01.99]Open tablet to leave this area and transport the findings to your museum.
[70:04.90]Okay.
[70:14.07]I can hire a worker?
[70:17.93]Okay, so I can go back to the museum.
[70:19.30]How do I... Do you want to send the crates?
[70:21.20]Yes!
[70:23.94]Yes, I do.
[70:28.58]What does Doth mean?
[70:29.72]Tell me.
[70:30.33]Or I'll turn the stream off right now.
[70:32.21]I'm going to turn my stream off.
[70:33.01]I'm going to hit end stream.
[70:33.75]I'm hovering over it right now.
[70:35.31]What does Doth mean?
[70:39.04]Three, two, one means two.
[70:41.90]Thank you for saving the stream.
[70:43.64]Lucky, lucky, lucky.
[70:45.58]It didn't take me long to get to the museum, but even though the trip was quick, I couldn't stop thinking about the job.
[70:51.86]I was constantly preoccupied with collecting and preparing dinosaur bones.
[70:57.74]When I arrived at the museum's lab, it was time to start cleaning what I had found.
[71:02.07]It was a fascinating experience.
[71:04.23]It required a lot of time and attention, but the result was always worth the effort.
[71:14.28]There's a lot in this game.
[71:15.48]It's fun.
[71:19.34]Okay, moving the crates around.
[71:20.44]Move the blocks with fossils to the cleaning station.
[71:25.45]That's it.
[71:25.83]It's so visual.
[71:26.71]That's why I've been able to just blow through this tutorial.
[71:28.89]Look at this.
[71:30.83]Remove plaster and extract fossil from the stone using the available tools.
[71:35.57]I almost said avalanche.
[71:37.92]Ooh!
[71:38.18]Ooh!
[71:40.43]After extracting the fossil, make a decision who should clean this set of bones, you or the museum employee.
[71:51.99]If you clean the bones by hand, pay attention to the game controls in the upper left corner.
[71:55.06]Here you'll find some useful features such as focus mode and highlighting of uncleaned areas.
[72:04.70]Oh, that just scared the shit out of me.
[72:06.38]I thought there was a monster in here.
[72:13.90]What is this thing?
[72:21.42]Why am I skiing?
[72:22.28]Okay, cool.
[72:24.97]Get off.
[72:30.01]Forklift.
[72:30.51]Alright, what do we got in here?
[72:34.77]Unknown bone, unknown species.
[72:36.27]Let's take a look.
[72:40.68]Alright.
[72:41.40]Let's clean it.
[73:02.81]How do I get this off?
[73:13.97]Is it a loot box?
[73:20.49]Do I just carve it this way?
[73:21.51]Oh, there we go.
[73:24.34]Okay.
[73:27.84]So now I'm looking for the... Where was the fossil?
[73:31.86]Right there.
[73:37.03]Watch out.
[73:37.31]Don't break it.
[73:37.73]Don't break it.
[73:38.15]Can I break it if I'm not careful?
[73:45.87]I'll clean it.
[73:46.31]I want to do it.
[73:47.24]Clean it.
[73:47.52]Whoa.
[73:58.46]Oh, shit.
[73:58.90]I broke it.
[73:59.92]I think I broke it.
[74:00.46]Did I break it?
[74:13.39]Cleaning scope?
[74:15.53]Oh wait, you can see magnified!
[74:17.47]That's funny.
[74:28.36]I need to rotate this.
[74:35.27]Alright, so what is that?
[74:49.48]Remember?
[74:50.42]Remember that one?
[74:59.49]Okay.
[75:07.17]This is gonna take too long.
[75:15.84]These just look like the dinosaur chicken nuggets.
[75:21.67]Well, they are based in reality.
[75:29.63]Send fossil to preparation room.
[75:39.86]Faced.
[75:42.08]Faced.
[75:43.78]Fodwatchers, skip.
[75:46.19]Wild Watchers, don't listen to... Don't... You're gonna let somebody dictate what you should do.
[75:49.39]You're gonna listen to one person dictate what you should do with, like, what you do with your time?
[75:56.00]Think about that.
[75:56.48]You're not gonna let somebody tell you how to dictate your time, right?
[76:01.84]Stay!
[76:02.54]Listen to that guy.
[76:03.22]Alright.
[76:14.61]Just painting some barbecue sauce on these.
[76:18.13]Is it ready?
[76:18.53]Now what?
[76:26.92]Am I supposed to do this?
[76:34.75]There's so much going into this.
[76:36.21]What is going on?
[76:37.01]Look at how much is going into this.
[76:47.26]There's something kind of therapeutic about doing what I'm doing, though.
[76:50.26]I like this.
[77:02.21]Can I upgrade the tools?
[77:05.34]Are there upgrades in this game?
[77:06.24]You're ruining them.
[77:23.68]Dinosaur ribs.
[77:25.72]Those aren't done.
[77:26.42]That's not done.
[77:33.95]Alright, what's the next step?
[77:39.53]When do I drop them into the hot vegetable oil?
[77:48.44]We got a joint cooking up dinosaur bones like you wouldn't believe.
[77:58.09]Full of flavor.
[78:03.13]I've been coming here for 25 years.
[78:08.97]That's Don Stevenson.
[78:12.20]He got the joint from his granddad.
[78:18.72]So what made you want to eat dinosaur bones?
[78:22.56]Well, my grandfather was a paleontologist and one day he's out there.
[78:26.68]Decided to take a little taste snack on some of the bones he had found.
[78:31.91]And realized that there was still some pretty delicious marrow in there and some meat still there.
[78:36.13]We opened up this place and I've been taking it all over ever since.
[78:43.96]He said among us.
[78:59.70]Alright, spin it around.
[79:23.20]This, oh my god!
[79:24.27]This is what it takes to do this?
[79:25.47]Just spray paint them?
[79:33.05]Whoa!
[79:35.15]Remember, you'd make a bad dentist.
[79:41.62]It's really simplified, dude.
[79:46.06]Millions of year-old fossils.
[79:49.44]So what you got cooking in here?
[79:50.82]Well, these are T-Rex legs.
[79:54.49]Only eight of these exist on Earth.
[79:57.41]Oh, wow!
[79:58.75]So you marinate those?
[80:00.81]Yeah.
[80:02.35]Water.
[80:02.49]Water.
[80:04.65]Water from the sink.
[80:07.39]And he goes, he's like, goes and dips his finger in the water from the sink in the bucket and goes... Buddy.
[80:14.63]Whoa.
[80:17.21]It's like, that's just, that's just sink water?
[80:23.36]Okay, yeah, yeah, let's go.
[80:27.30]Take it from this, put it on this, into the skeleton or store it in the museum storeroom.
[80:31.50]Ooh.
[80:31.78]Ooh.
[80:36.49]After cleaning and connecting the skeleton pieces, you can proceed to complete the entire dinosaur.
[80:41.35]When the knowledge tab on your tablet becomes available, you gain the ability to manage dinosaur skeletons.
[80:48.61]Really?
[80:48.85]And you can move it into an exhibit.
[80:56.42]That's crazy.
[80:57.34]Okay.
[80:58.10]Design mode?
[81:02.95]Oh, shit.
[81:03.37]I don't know where this goes.
[81:07.52]I don't know where this is supposed to go.
[81:11.70]Oh.
[81:13.49]Yes, I do.
[81:16.71]Do I have the whole thing?
[81:26.93]I do.
[81:27.23]What the hell is this?
[81:33.17]I'll take it.
[81:39.13]Don't drop it.
[81:40.69]Oh, look, it's right here!
[81:43.17]Oh, whoa!
[81:43.75]Okay, so I'm assuming the other stuff is the head and the legs.
[81:52.57]Drop it, it just shatters.
[82:03.50]Oh, it's Bob's dino grill calling.
[82:06.91]I heard you dropped a dinosaur bone and shat it on the ground.
[82:11.01]Mind if I come take that for you for like $40?
[82:40.48]I've been eating here for 25 years.
[82:41.96]Yeah, so you got a statistic for us, don't you?
[82:44.74]Don't you, Bob?
[82:46.04]Yes, I do.
[82:46.72]Yes.
[82:47.78]Every single person that's ever eaten here has gotten sick.
[82:50.86]Every single one.
[82:51.66]Every single one.
[82:52.48]Every single one, guy.
[83:01.69]I think this is the vertebrae.
[83:09.18]But I have to manually clean this, don't I?
[83:11.31]Alright, we're gonna do the speedrun.
[83:12.79]Somebody said I'd be a bad dentist.
[83:36.03]Did you see what I just did?
[83:45.23]I gotta get a worker.
[83:56.30]I need a worker.
[83:56.86]Why is your face cam shaking?
[84:00.30]Um... There's the wind.
[84:04.50]It's really windy here in Vegas.
[84:07.88]Told you guys.
[84:12.66]Jesus.
[84:21.06]No, it's because my mouse is on my desk and my desk is connected to the monitor.
[84:24.30]The monitor is sitting here and the webcam is on the monitor.
[84:29.12]So when I go like this, I shake the whole thing.
[84:32.86]And I'm like shaking right now here.
[84:41.65]I really probably should put this somewhere else, shouldn't I?
[84:58.07]These ones are so small, I hate it.
[85:06.47]They're too small.
[85:11.15]These little meatballs.
[85:27.22]I hate it.
[85:27.68]I just have to do, like, I hate them.
[85:29.92]You got, okay, for those new viewers out there, I hate needing to, like, hold left mouse button down and, like, trace, like, really small, tiny little areas really consistently.
[85:41.59]Oh, it just makes me want to scream.
[85:43.75]It makes me want to scream.
[85:46.15]Like, I just want to, like, just get up and run in a fucking circle.
[85:50.17]I just hate, like, my arm.
[85:51.15]I hate it.
[85:51.60]Like, it feels fucking, I hate it.
[85:52.92]Oh, phone guy ass.
[86:09.82]You only gotta spray this once.
[86:11.81]Like, don't spray this too much in the bathroom, you know what I mean?
[86:14.31]I know.
[86:15.89]People, like, I know if you go to the bathroom, you really don't want anyone to know you went to the bathroom.
[86:20.35]You're doing- Don't fucking do this.
[86:23.13]Just literally like this.
[86:24.41]This is all you need.
[86:25.25]Ready?
[86:25.45]That's it.
[86:28.12]And then fucking stop, and then just leave.
[86:30.62]Relax.
[86:34.76]Why can't I-
[86:48.26]Right on the rotisserie, I love it.
[87:01.64]I'm serious.
[87:07.48]I would be a horrible dentist, you're right.
[87:11.31]like sitting there with your mouth open the dentist is like really leaning in and slowly cleaning each tooth and then goes like what's he doing nah sorry man I just like I just hate like beings like doing tiny little movements my arm gets long I feel weird I would think there was a spider in my mouth
[87:49.56]It was the other day.
[87:50.38]True.
[87:56.78]Stop shaking your webcam.
[87:57.82]Stop shaking your webcam.
[87:58.92]I'll put it somewhere else later.
[88:03.17]I'll, like, glue it to the fucking wall or something.
[88:04.87]I don't know.
[88:05.85]Where are you supposed to put a webcam?
[88:07.87]To, like, prevent that from happening.
[88:12.25]I don't... You know what I mean?
[88:13.33]Where am I supposed to put a webcam to make this not happen?
[88:27.71]You're the streamer.
[88:28.37]I mean, I... You'll use a DSLR with a stand?
[88:35.86]I'm not using a DSLR, no fucking thanks.
[88:38.90]Nope.
[88:43.91]Nope.
[88:50.95]I don't want you guys to see every individual pore on my face.
[88:53.73]Sorry.
[88:54.43]Not happening.
[88:55.29]Not pushing 40.
[88:57.21]Not pushing 40.
[88:58.25]That's not happening.
[89:08.66]We want to see you in 4K.
[89:09.90]I don't want to see me in 4K.
[89:11.24]So why would I want you to see me in 4K?
[89:23.22]What an insecure millionaire.
[89:48.08]Let's go.
[89:51.32]This dude's not...
[89:54.17]What are you saying?
[89:58.36]We want to see... We want to see your beautiful face.
[90:04.62]You're looking at it, literally looking at it right now.
[90:06.70]Donate your teeth.
[90:08.60]What are you... No, shut up.
[90:09.88]In a nice way, right?
[90:12.44]Shut up in a nice way.
[90:31.59]These bones are so little.
[90:32.55]Alright, so I can have somebody do this and I can do the digging part, right?
[90:39.25]Do I have to make money or something?
[90:44.38]Or do I have to do these for you because it's a tutorial?
[90:50.07]This is kind of relaxing, though.
[90:51.05]I can see they're just kind of hanging out and just doing this.
[90:53.69]Exactly what I'm doing right now.
[91:00.94]That other one's definitely the head.
[91:03.32]No way it's not.
[91:06.44]It is.
[91:06.62]This is a big one.
[91:13.10]Okay, so now can I just have somebody do it?
[91:17.60]Shut up in a respectful way.
[91:24.62]It's the whole skeleton.
[91:34.11]Can I live in your pores?
[91:37.43]You're fu- That is fucking weird.
[91:38.35]I don't- Whatever you- No.
[91:41.22]Find that person now.
[91:53.09]Oh my god, lookit!
[91:53.79]There's tons of little things in here.
[92:02.65]Okay.
[92:03.59]Also, preparation room.
[92:06.41]What happens if I do that?
[92:10.83]Where is it?
[92:17.97]Does somebody else do it?
[92:18.87]Do I have to go get it?
[92:23.69]Oh, okay.
[92:24.31]Somebody's just doing it.
[92:25.09]Oh, this is way better.
[92:31.75]Can there be fire?
[92:33.29]Yeah, I could have had one going while I did the other one.
[92:37.35]They're way faster than you.
[92:38.89]I just started working here.
[92:46.72]What is this prestige roadmap?
[92:49.06]It's almost done.
[92:57.40]I thought you were being attacked by a serious scam.
[93:00.60]I can't even say.
[93:01.26]Serious Sam enemy.
[93:06.98]This IRL takes about five years.
[93:13.52]Oh my god, that's so much better.
[93:19.59]So with this, I can display this.
[93:22.95]Holy shit, that wind.
[93:24.21]I feel like my fucking... Ugh, that's eerie.
[93:38.85]They had, like, look at these eye bones.
[93:40.53]Okay.
[93:44.66]Alright, I have a full dinosaur.
[93:48.40]What kind of dinosaur is it?
[93:52.34]The museum I was doing my internship in was getting ready for renovation.
[93:56.34]I was afraid my classes were about to be cut because of that.
[94:01.19]Orthomimus.
[94:01.79]Orthomimus.
[94:02.23]Jesus!
[94:02.43]This wind is fucking scary, man.
[94:31.24]Alright, put it, let's Jack it up.
[94:32.58]I don't even, can you guys hear it?
[94:35.10]It's violent.
[94:41.16]Oh my goodness.

[95:59.84]That's cool.
[96:00.44]Look at the decoration symbols.
[96:03.50]Decorations and shit.
[96:04.52]This is fun.
[96:06.26]Rotate and scaling?
[96:11.13]What?
[96:13.95]Okay.
[96:21.54]Okay.
[96:23.34]Next pose.
[96:23.90]I can pose it?
[96:25.66]Wait, what?
[96:27.62]This is cool.
[96:28.16]Alright, hold on.
[96:30.10]I need to... How do I rotate it?
[96:37.50]Right there.
[96:39.01]And I want to do a pose.
[96:44.51]That one's kind of cool.
[96:45.55]Yep.
[96:46.21]That's where it's going.
[96:46.79]Okay.
[96:51.35]Now... Grass?
[96:53.09]Grass?
[97:02.36]Jesus Christ!
[97:05.36]I like the grass.
[97:06.48]Or the sand.
[97:07.84]That's kind of cool too.
[97:11.32]Turn off the noise gate?
[97:13.91]Oh my god, guys!
[97:15.81]Okay, I'm going to turn the noise gate off.
[97:19.57]This is what it sounds like without the noise gate.
[97:21.53]Are you ready?
[97:21.93]Hold on.
[97:32.08]Just wait.
[97:38.63]I mean, you can hear it a little bit, but wait till the huge one happens.
[97:50.09]I just want to catch a big one.
[97:51.63]I feel like we're like storm watching right now.
[97:55.05]He's going to do a joke, isn't he?
[97:56.03]No, it's not a joke.
[97:57.08]It's fucking crazy.
[98:00.31]Sometimes Vegas gets 70 plus mile per hour winds.
[98:15.02]No, I want a big one to happen before I continue.
[98:21.58]When a big one happens, every time I go, Jesus, that's what I'm reacting to.
[98:32.20]Now it's not going to do it, because I'm waiting for it to happen.
[98:38.33]No.
[98:40.25]No.
[98:43.13]He's going to just do a huge fart.
[98:48.11]I'm like, hey guys, wait for it.
[98:50.51]And I just go like... That would be really funny.
[98:54.75]It would probably piss a lot of you off, but...
[99:01.69]Alright, I'm going to give this like 20 or 30 more seconds.
[99:03.81]10 more seconds.
[99:19.72]Viewer's dropping.
[99:20.61]I don't care.
[99:21.49]10 seconds.
[99:33.54]Come on, just do it.
[99:35.01]So I can stop doing this.
[99:36.11]Viewers rising?
[99:36.79]I don't care.
[99:40.11]That was a mini one.
[99:40.83]10 seconds.
[99:50.23]Every time I talk, it happens!
[100:13.24]It doesn't want to do it now.
[100:14.04]Whatever.
[100:14.30]Okay.
[100:15.89]Just know that it's really crazy.
[100:20.51]You know what I mean?
[100:23.85]What does my scream sound like with the noise gate at like a million percent?
[100:32.02]Hi, hi, hi, hi, hi, hi.
[100:34.74]Hello?
[100:36.90]Hello?
[100:38.60]What does that sound like?
[100:42.99]I just fucking screamed into the mic.
[100:46.83]Can you hear it?
[100:49.53]Okay, let's get back to what we were doing.
[100:55.25]That's unfortunate.
[100:56.90]I really want you guys to hear it.
[101:02.08]Okay, so.
[101:02.88]It's like you're trapped in a box of frosted flakes.
[101:16.24]Is that what it sounded like?
[101:19.88]I'm gonna go with the stones.
[101:23.31]A huge one just happened right when I turned it off.
[101:25.39]I only have one plant?
[101:33.53]Big plants.
[101:35.86]I'll get rid of that.
[101:37.54]Freeze.
[101:38.34]Grass.
[101:47.12]Alright, that's fine.
[101:49.28]That looks good.
[102:01.44]Perfect!
[102:03.01]Looks good to me.
[102:08.37]Wait a minute.
[102:09.21]Take out.
[102:10.73]Oh, shit.
[102:11.47]I need more room.
[102:15.27]I guess I could fit here.
[102:19.35]Uh, how do I move this back again?
[102:21.11]This, okay.
[102:22.29]Um, this... I need to... Can I... What, should I sell this?
[102:25.31]I have this stupid fucking Zamboni machine in the way.
[102:37.64]How do I get rid of that?
[102:39.40]Back, back up.
[102:41.28]I have to get... Move this thing.
[102:55.89]This is pretty fucking cool.
[103:02.24]I like that.
[103:04.72]That's pretty museum-like.
[103:07.90]I like this one.
[103:08.36]Alright, walls.
[103:12.24]Ooh, I like that.
[103:13.88]I like this one.
[103:14.70]I like this one.
[103:15.36]No, I don't.
[103:16.96]This one's good.
[103:18.42]Alright, decorations.
[103:19.66]We need a bench here.
[103:21.54]So people can sit and look at them fighting each other.
[103:24.87]I want a plant over here.
[103:25.77]No, a little bit bigger than that.
[103:29.95]Paintings!
[103:36.88]Stacker them!
[103:37.60]Stacker them!
[103:38.16]Okay.
[103:39.96]Okay.
[103:47.28]Cool.
[103:48.74]I found that.
[103:49.28]Okay.
[103:57.47]What's this?
[104:00.77]That doesn't look bad.
[104:01.43]Alright, now I need to... Can I move this over?
[104:12.48]I gotta move this over here.
[104:20.09]It's kind of in the way, though, isn't it?
[104:25.66]Wait, what's that mean?
[104:28.96]Oh.
[104:32.00]This thing's... How do I make it so I can fit it?
[104:37.92]Paintings suck.
[104:39.76]Make it one big exhibit.
[104:41.02]Yeah, how do I do that?
[104:41.64]Can I put them both in here?
[104:48.11]I can make it just one huge exhibit, right?
[104:49.43]And put the other one in?
[104:55.33]Right?
[104:58.09]I can.
[104:58.95]Alright, nice, nice, nice.
[104:59.93]This is perfect.
[105:04.73]Okay, so I want to put this one here.
[105:06.65]Rotate it.
[105:12.00]It's too big.
[105:15.08]That's not bad.
[105:15.52]He fit right there.
[105:17.50]Alright, I want to pose him though.
[105:21.47]Yep.
[105:26.89]That's alright.
[105:27.51]That looks fine.
[105:31.02]We need some more plants and shit though.
[105:32.52]Move this over here.
[105:33.18]This looks pretty good.
[105:44.40]That looks fine.
[105:44.90]Okay, now we need, um... There's a little, like, bird nest for this.
[105:50.64]Alright, that's good.
[105:51.10]Okay.
[105:53.88]We got it.
[105:55.52]Look!
[105:58.25]Beautiful.
[105:59.79]Stunning.
[106:03.47]Close these fucking windows.
[106:04.41]I don't want people looking in here for free.
[106:06.89]Shut these up.
[106:09.17]Ooh.
[106:09.39]Ooh.
[106:10.73]Ah!
[106:11.31]Ooh!
[106:12.37]Ooh!
[106:12.77]What's that?
[106:13.17]Dinosaur claw!
[106:14.09]Whoa!
[106:15.64]I'm in a weird mood tonight, and I'm really sorry.
[106:21.25]That was the last day of my internship.
[106:23.55]Too symmetrical.
[106:24.27]A great adventure just came to an end.
[106:27.53]The night I was packing to go home, the telephone in my room rang.
[106:32.66]I couldn't believe it.
[106:33.68]It's a weird phone.
[106:34.64]The director called to ask me to stay and help the museum build a bigger skeleton.
[106:40.02]There was a vacant position because one of the workers got sick.
[106:44.90]I felt bad for the guy, but I was so glad there was a chance to work in the museum for longer.
[106:51.70]The decision was a no brainer.
[106:53.61]I went to the museum the next day.
[106:57.91]Although the place wasn't new to me, this particular moment felt different.
[107:02.61]It was the first time I was asked to enter the museum's workshop.
[107:06.05]With my heart pounding and my hands sweating, I walked towards the door.
[107:16.32]OK, just in case I gotta shake somebody's hand.
[107:24.90]Oh, wow!
[107:26.84]This is a Tyrannosaurus Rex!
[107:28.94]Complete the T-Rex.
[107:29.54]You got it.
[108:05.50]Oh! Collectivly, everybody in the room. Oh! Oh!
[108:25.50]What is this tunnel? Nevermind.
[108:32.50]Shut up, please.
[108:36.37]Okay, I'll shut up.
[108:50.53]How am I supposed to get those up here?
[108:51.59]Do I have to walk?
[108:58.30]Can I throw?
[109:04.86]I can't.
[109:05.30]I have to walk individually.
[109:06.84]No, I don't.
[109:10.82]So, I could have decorated this place too?
[109:14.12]When did we stop making money?
[109:15.28]That's what I want to know.
[109:30.57]I want to go dig some more.
[109:31.43]That was really fun.
[109:35.13]I did it.
[109:55.25]Open your window?
[109:56.87]No.
[109:57.27]It sounds like Interstellar.
[110:13.46]It does.
[110:13.88]It does.
[110:14.58]If I saw the movie, which I haven't, I don't know.
[110:16.40]Never seen that movie.
[110:16.92]Just pretended to know what you meant.
[110:18.36]But didn't I get a job already?
[110:19.68]Yeah.
[110:40.74]after six months I started looking for any job but that also didn't come easily I was trying hard but to no avail not a good movie but everyone saw it I didn't see it one year after graduation things finally started to turn around although it wasn't exactly how I had imagined it did I give my spider-man take yet did I give my my new spider-man movie take yet
[111:08.53]Okay.
[111:09.63]I didn't.
[111:10.83]Okay.
[111:12.11]Let me give you my Spider-Man.
[111:13.09]Just real quick.
[111:15.61]The second half of the Spider-Man No Way Home movie felt like a college humor video.
[111:25.53]That's it.
[111:25.93]That's the take.
[111:26.39]That's the only take I'm going to have.
[111:27.73]That's the only take I'm going to give you.
[111:37.74]It felt like an old college humor video from like 2011, 2008.
[111:48.92]Did I think it was a bad movie?
[111:50.18]No.
[111:51.48]It was very enjoyable.
[111:53.92]It was very enjoyable.
[112:00.84]I almost kind of felt like
[112:03.29]like the second like third of the movie I was expecting actors to look into the camera and smile after saying anything like oh yeah blah blah blah blah like that's what I was expecting like after every like three or four lines I I thought it was good I liked it I liked it but I like I felt like I was just watching a movie you know what I mean it was like a movie
[112:31.62]It's like, hey, we're making a movie right now.
[112:35.18]Do you know there's a movie on the screen?
[112:37.92]It was like, hey, just want to let you know, you're watching a movie right now.
[112:41.71]Hey, this is a movie.
[112:44.09]You like movies, don't you?
[112:45.65]You've seen movies, haven't you?
[112:47.11]You're a big fan of movies?
[112:48.11]I like movies too.
[112:53.27]Is this my house?
[113:01.15]And hey, I'm going to be very honest with you.
[113:03.59]Spider-Man is my favorite character in everything.
[113:06.31]It's not Batman.
[113:07.51]It's not Captain America.
[113:08.95]It's Spider-Man.
[113:09.65]Spider-Man is my favorite character.
[113:12.40]And I think the trilogy was the best Spider-Man trilogy, the best Spider-Man movies that they've ever made.
[113:16.54]What about Sam Raimi's Spider-Man movie?
[113:21.74]Alright, let go of me.
[113:23.54]Yeah, they're great.
[113:25.48]But I think this trilogy was great.
[113:29.06]I think they were great.
[113:30.50]Homecoming?
[113:31.28]It's fucking amazing.
[113:32.84]Far From Home?
[113:33.46]I loved it.
[113:34.48]This one?
[113:36.62]I liked it.
[113:37.78]I really liked it.
[113:39.14]I liked it.
[113:40.42]I liked it a lot.
[113:41.96]That's it.
[113:44.18]Venom?
[113:48.63]Be careful.
[113:50.75]How do I go in my house?
[113:51.65]Where are my keys?
[113:58.29]But a part of me almost felt like, in some of the scenes in the new Spider-Man movie, like, the director was just gonna start walking around on the set.
[114:06.41]With, like, a fucking stone in his hand.
[114:07.95]With, like, the thing in his hand.
[114:08.91]Like, just be like, this looks good.
[114:10.92]Okay.
[114:11.32]Just, like, walking around in the background.
[114:12.50]Alright, how do I... Select drone?
[114:19.52]No, I wanna go... How do I go in my house?
[114:25.86]What was the objective?
[114:32.62]35-year-old man complains about comic book movies.
[114:35.80]I'm not complaining.
[114:37.44]That's not a complaint.
[114:38.40]That was a very, very mild observation.
[114:41.59]It was mild.
[114:42.77]It was very, very mild, okay?
[114:47.53]How do I go in my house?
[114:49.39]Holy shit.
[114:50.35]I get every channel from every country.
[114:54.69]Literally every country on Earth, I get all their TV stations.
[114:58.34]I'd love to get in here.
[115:00.14]That was a mild take.
[115:01.92]Okay, come on.
[115:05.66]Why is there a car made out of ground beef in my house?
[115:09.09]How do I get in here?
[115:10.31]What's going on?
[115:10.99]How do I get in the house?
[115:16.51]I have to go in the garage?
[115:18.71]Dude, why can't I go in my front door?
[115:20.67]Oh, watch out for the red barrels.
[115:21.54]Dude, I'm sorry.
[115:34.40]I'm not going in there if there's red barrels.
[115:37.64]Like bright red barrels is like, those explode.
[115:40.61]I'm not going in there.
[115:41.69]There was one time Grandpa bought an old Russian truck that was clearly beyond fixing, but that didn't scare him.
[115:48.29]He always used to tell us he'd finally finish repairing it.
[115:53.68]Unfortunately, his body didn't catch up with his spirit and he had to pass on his little project.
[115:59.58]I decided to clean up the workshop for him.
[116:04.57]Yeah, dude, I don't know.
[116:06.15]Like bright red barrels with like the flame sign on them.
[116:10.47]We are slowly getting these out of the house.
[116:12.94]We're removing these.
[116:15.74]Okay.
[116:18.36]This should explode.
[116:21.44]What do I do?
[116:22.14]Can I just like... No, I can't.
[116:26.52]What does this have to... What the fuck, dude?
[116:29.28]What is going on in here?
[116:32.65]Yeah, my grandfather collected exploding barrels.
[116:36.79]And he kept them all in his garage for some fucking reason.
[116:39.71]I don't know why.
[116:40.39]I don't know why.
[116:41.03]Do I have to fix the car?
[116:46.26]What the fuck was in there?
[116:53.74]Wash your hands.
[116:54.79]Wash your hands.
[116:55.45]Grandpa was shitting into a box.
[116:57.11]Wash your hands immediately.
[116:58.75]Go wash your hands right now.
[117:03.70]I found the lost fossil piece that I found during the school trip.
[117:07.14]Despite it being over 15 years ago, I felt the exact same mix of excitement and joy that I'd felt on that beach years ago.
[117:20.65]The desire to search for fossils has become immediately obvious with full force.
[117:27.33]This game is cool.
[117:28.77]I actually think this is a fun game.
[117:30.11]I just had to put it into action.
[117:33.04]I started implementing my plan by acquiring a set of excavation tools.
[117:37.12]This was possible thanks to a garage sale.
[117:41.46]Wait, now we're just going to glaze over the fact that Grandpa has a bunch of gas tanks in his garage?
[117:50.25]guns I got my like rifle collection okay check your desk from time to time you may find a paleontology there's a lot of content in this game I'm not going to let the negative andes here tell me there's a lot of interesting content this is this is cool I think this is actually pretty cool I do okay like you can paint you wait I can mess with the car
[118:22.03]And in the next room, the garage, the museum, you can see a map on the wall.
[118:26.05]It'll show available locations that you can travel to.
[118:28.29]Can I go to Nevada?
[118:33.50]If Nevada's in this game, and I can go to, like, Las Vegas, this is a B+.
[118:37.86]This game is a B. You can also find here collectible items discovered during research expeditions.
[118:49.03]This is like my house.
[118:49.95]This is cool.
[118:58.61]Okay, so what's in the news?
[119:00.21]Dinosaur skeletons are waiting to be discovered.
[119:02.25]Alright.
[119:12.56]Choose a toy.
[119:16.51]Hard difficulty.
[119:18.09]No, I don't want to do that.
[119:20.37]Alright, let's, um, let's go.
[120:36.18]Thank you.
[121:23.15]Okay, those elbows are a little fucked up.
[121:27.03]He's supposed to be going like this.
[121:29.32]Like with his arms like on his sides.
[122:07.60]He's like a muscle shirt button up on.
[122:09.48]Alright, now I need one more finishing touch.
[122:48.09]His teeth are kind of fucked up.
[122:51.82]This is just like somebody drawing like their boss.
[122:55.82]You know what I mean?
[122:56.48]Like, oh, there he is.
[122:58.16]That motherfucker.
[122:59.04]Like, oh, this is the boss.
[123:03.54]You're going to get fired.
[123:14.39]This is too much empty space up here.
[123:19.84]There's too much empty space up here.
[123:24.42]I'm not happy with this piece.
[123:27.03]I ain't happy with this.
[123:29.27]Get back to work.
[123:30.07]Yeah, I crumple it up before the boss gets over.
[123:32.15]I'm like... What you working on over there?
[123:37.65]Just like, you know, stats and shit.
[123:40.89]I was trying the boss.
[123:42.41]There's too much empty space here.
[123:46.96]I'm not happy with this.
[123:47.64]I'm going to throw it all away.
[124:00.58]Put sunglasses on him?
[124:01.54]No, no, I'm not happy with this.
[124:04.32]How about like a house?
[124:08.62]The background, right?
[124:09.22]We gotta have like some vocal point, right?
[124:16.93]See that?
[124:17.25]He's in the foreground.
[124:19.13]Don't adjust your fucking TV, man.
[124:21.69]Don't adjust your screen.
[124:23.80]This is perspective here.
[124:24.86]He's in the foreground.
[124:26.54]Don't be alarmed.
[125:27.28]This guy's scary.
[125:32.62]The house shouldn't be like alive.
[125:38.48]He's focusing.
[125:39.24]I feel like this is okay.
[125:41.82]Don't they do those things where it's like the way you draw a house, the way you draw a person, the way you draw a son.
[125:49.04]Isn't this like you can determine the kind of like personality, like psychology that I have or something, right?
[125:53.19]I feel like I just did all of those.
[125:54.75]So there you go.
[126:01.28]Alright, now what do I do with this?
[126:05.80]It's just gonna be this.
[126:06.84]Can I hang this up?
[126:09.99]I definitely did not draw these.
[126:13.71]I did not.
[126:14.19]The same person did not draw those.
[126:17.29]At all.
[126:24.50]What the fuck?
[126:25.08]Dinosaurs on Mars?
[126:28.38]Okay, so now what do I do?
[126:31.78]I'm trapped in here.
[126:33.24]Get me out of here.
[126:33.70]Alright, I'm fine.
[126:36.48]Holy shit.
[126:39.28]Where did you get a military vehicle?
[126:44.62]Why do I have a military truck?
[126:53.61]I'm sorry, guys.
[126:54.13]They both have to be Jurassic Park themed trucks.
[127:19.06]Oh, you're really leaning into that here.
[127:21.86]That's good.
[127:31.63]Okay, I'm ready.
[127:34.21]Make it bright pink.
[127:48.53]It's like a big bubblegum car.
[127:56.96]Alright, that's good.
[127:59.14]Oh, Jerma!
[128:01.34]Oh, I know, hey, Jerma!
[128:02.64]Alright, now what do I do?
[128:07.75]Where's my blue, though?
[128:08.43]I need blue.
[128:09.91]I need a third car, and that third car has to be like an aqua.
[128:15.25]Like a teal.
[128:17.61]Nice Thanos truck.
[128:18.81]It's not a Thanos truck.
[128:19.97]It's literally bubblegum pink.
[128:26.50]What kind of insane person puts their lawnmower on a shelf like this?
[128:30.24]Am I weird for not ever doing that?
[128:32.00]What do I do with this stuff?
[128:46.41]These are all locked.
[128:49.79]It's all locked.
[128:55.22]Am I insane for not- How do you just get it down?
[128:57.70]Like, how do you pull it down?
[129:00.64]There's a lot of tools.
[129:01.62]Okay, where's my- What do I have to do?

[136:20.28]Oh my god, I look crazed.
[136:27.51]Let's go like this.
[136:37.25]Okay, so let's take a look at some of this stuff.
[136:40.91]They're in these little bags.
[136:43.87]I think this is... I don't know what this is, but it's some type of fossilized, like, pyrite.
[136:54.46]There's a bunch of these.
[136:56.52]There's, like, at least four or five of these.
[136:57.98]It's in this cute little bag.
[136:58.82]I think this is for Fool's Gold, yeah?
[137:01.51]Okay, that's cool.
[137:01.99]Can you see?
[137:06.58]Very cool.
[137:07.58]But that's not necessarily a fossil, right?
[137:10.64]This is.
[137:12.50]Be careful.
[137:12.92]I don't like break this.
[137:15.09]I think this is like a tooth.
[137:18.53]I think they explained what they were.
[137:19.89]I just don't remember.
[137:22.27]Take a look at this thing.
[137:22.99]This is crazy looking.
[137:25.53]Yeah, look at this.
[137:26.45]This is like this.
[137:27.37]Look at this thing.
[137:29.97]This is like a tooth.
[137:31.93]What is this?
[137:35.47]Isn't that crazy looking?
[137:39.98]Is it like a dinosaur tooth or like a shark tooth?
[137:44.52]It's smooth on the other side, right?
[137:46.18]But over here, it's really tiny.
[137:48.89]Fossilized like shark tooth or fossilized dinosaur tooth?
[137:53.49]That one's really cool.
[137:56.47]Is it a plant?
[137:59.65]It looks like a tooth.
[138:02.75]That's a crustacean, you idiot.
[138:05.47]No, this is a crustacean, you idiot!
[138:09.47]Oh my god, this is kind of delicate.
[138:13.35]This is like a... Whoa, I don't even remember seeing this one.
[138:18.33]This is a fossilized cinnamon bun roll.
[138:24.09]Fossilized cinnamon bun roll.
[138:27.63]That's like a shell.
[138:28.15]It's like a seashell.
[138:30.97]Look at that.
[138:36.59]Let me get a better view here.
[138:41.49]Cool.
[138:43.95]It's pretty detailed.
[138:44.71]You can't really see, maybe, but it's really detailed.
[138:46.50]It's like a Nautilus or something, right?
[138:49.78]There's another one here, too.
[138:58.64]What's with this one?
[139:00.56]Ooh, this one feels weird.
[139:03.22]What the fuck is this?
[139:08.46]Whoa!
[139:09.14]This one's crazy!
[139:11.14]Oh my god, it's like a fucking skeleton.
[139:13.30]This is actually a skeleton.
[139:16.48]Are you ready for the reveal?
[139:18.86]Check this out.
[139:25.67]It's like a rib cage or something.
[139:30.81]Look at that.
[139:37.00]It's like an animal's rib cage.
[139:43.70]It's like embedded in there.
[139:44.97]It's crazy looking.
[139:48.59]It's like a big fossilized bug or something, whatever it is.
[139:54.93]What's it called?
[139:56.38]It's trilobite.
[139:59.52]It's an ancient pill bug.
[140:03.09]All of a sudden, like, six legs break out from the sides, and it like, like, crawls in my mouth.
[140:13.11]What is, what is that?
[140:17.11]Extinct marine anthropods that form one of the earliest known groups of anthropods.
[140:21.91]The first appearance, so this is a legit fucking real animal here.
[140:28.63]Whoa, whoa, that's weird.
[140:33.10]It's, like, you can see its tail.
[140:34.48]I didn't show you this part.
[140:37.06]Can you see?
[140:40.34]See, like, that ridge in the middle there?
[140:41.70]That's, like, its tail.
[140:43.75]Whoa, this is weird.
[140:44.83]Cool.
[140:46.57]Alright, it's going back in the bag.
[140:55.85]That's what they looked like?
[141:01.04]Dude, it moved.
[141:02.00]I want to look at this one again.
[141:04.36]You guys think this is not a tooth?
[141:05.38]Does it look like a leaf?
[141:08.44]I know for a fact that they described them when they sent them.
[141:11.06]I just kind of forget.
[141:11.86]It's been a while.
[141:14.05]Yeah, look at the pattern on that.
[141:15.07]That's insane looking.
[141:16.13]Look at it.
[141:16.53]It's like a... Is it a leaf?
[141:26.65]It's just wild looking.
[141:34.08]Some kind of shell?
[141:34.96]Yeah, that's cool.
[141:37.62]Yeah, what a perfect time to do that.
[141:39.08]I'm probably gonna wash my hands, I think.
[141:41.46]I don't know.
[141:41.88]I feel like if you touch, like, a five million year old animal, I feel like I don't want to, like, put my hands on my face.
[141:49.33]Is that weird?
[141:49.85]Like, I feel like I should wash my hands.
[141:51.89]Shouldn't I?
[141:52.21]Alright, I'll be right back.
[141:53.77]I'm gonna wash my hands.
[141:55.51]Give me one second.
[142:40.54]Yeah, guys, I don't know.
[142:43.76]I don't want to have like some 10 million year old bacteria get into my body or something.
[142:55.65]Alright, let's go.
[142:59.59]It's a rock.
[143:02.85]It doesn't matter.
[143:03.47]It's a rock.
[143:05.65]I don't know.
[143:06.07]It could be something.
[143:07.09]It could be embedded in some kind of bacteria or something.
[143:10.81]Who eats rocks?
[143:11.73]I'm not going to put my hands on a rock and put my hands on my mouth.
[143:15.32]I put my hands on my face all the time.
[143:28.01]You did.
[143:28.53]You eat rocks.
[143:31.45]That was for research purposes.
[143:34.98]Not to eat for pleasure, right?
[143:37.60]That wasn't for me.
[143:38.41]I wasn't hungry.
[143:39.07]That was for research purposes to determine how old that rock could have been.
[143:44.19]That was for research purposes.
[143:45.59]That was for me to determine how old the rock was.
[143:47.17]Let's go.
[143:58.54]I think he's on meth, I don't know.
[144:00.79]gave me an idea to call my university professor.
[144:03.75]During our conversation, it turned out that he was about to start a new phase of research in exactly the same place as before.
[144:10.73]However, a lot has changed since then.
[144:12.57]They look like facehuggers.
[144:13.47]Yeah, they do.
[144:14.49]And the underground search for fossils will be conducted at a deeper level than before.
[144:21.99]Despite the limited budget he had at his disposal, we reached an agreement and I signed the contract.
[144:31.05]Look up isopods.
[144:32.25]They're like dinosaur bugs.
[144:33.41]Yeah, that's... They're scary.
[144:37.82]They're scary.
[144:40.52]Okay.
[144:41.96]Back to the game.
[144:42.44]Ooh, I'm in like... This is a bigger open world now.
[144:52.77]Alright, so we're gonna go through the same thing.
[144:54.09]What's the map look like?
[144:55.59]Where's the dig site?
[144:56.95]There is none.
[144:58.75]I just have to go find it.
[144:59.79]Let's go.
[145:06.73]Mouth sensitivity's gotta go down.
[145:09.89]Like, way down.
[145:10.73]Here we go.
[145:15.47]Do I have enough boxes?
[145:16.27]I need boxes.
[145:17.62]I need my excavation equipment to be loaded.
[145:22.84]Changing cars and fast travel.
[145:24.48]Yeah, you can change cars and travel around.
[145:28.78]Off-road.
[145:29.30]An important part of the hub is the laptop workstation.
[145:31.73]Change the car if you feel like it.
[145:32.95]Okay.
[145:34.51]Fuel tanks are used to refill gas canisters.
[145:36.27]I feel like that's not going to be too important, but it might be later.
[145:40.63]On the hub, you'll find the equipment necessary to set up your excavation, as well as empty boxes for transporting fossils.
[145:46.91]Put the crates for the fossils that you want to transport to the museum in the highlighted area.
[145:50.11]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[145:53.85]Let's go.
[145:54.13]Okay, I want a few of these, right?
[146:03.95]Car managing station.
[146:06.10]Car switching and fast travel.
[146:09.18]Once you have hired the right employees, you'll be able to use the fast travel tab.
[146:12.30]Okay, I need to hire employees to fast travel.
[146:15.42]That's good to know.
[146:17.14]And I can just switch cars with a laptop.
[146:19.57]Okay.
[146:21.91]Pack digging tools.
[146:26.29]Car trunk is full.
[146:27.25]With what?
[146:27.63]What's in the trunk?
[146:34.70]What do you mean it's full?
[146:35.54]Pick up canister.
[146:47.48]Canister into the car.
[146:48.46]Okay.
[146:50.86]Alright, so we're good, right?
[146:59.98]This symbol crates can be packed only into the back of the trunk, which is occupied at the moment.
[147:04.12]So wait, can I not bring these?
[147:05.18]I think there's a couple already in there.
[147:09.46]I don't know.
[147:20.14]Do I need to make two trips?
[147:21.66]What about over here?
[147:22.22]Can I, like, go over there?
[147:27.08]Is it my free to explore now?
[147:33.82]Where should I set up?
[147:41.20]What do I like right here?
[147:41.80]Dumbledore's voice?
[147:45.47]When have I ever done a Dumbledore impression?
[147:47.15]I've never done a Dumbledore impression.
[148:03.55]Okay, I'll try.
[148:04.41]Like that?
[148:05.95]Is that good?
[148:06.49]There's so much shit everywhere.
[148:09.62]Hold on.
[148:35.97]That was Voldemort.
[148:37.21]That was Harry Potter Dumbledore.
[149:02.16]Oh, yes, his full name.
[149:04.13]Harry Potter Dumbledore.
[149:06.42]No, I said name of the series, colon, name of the character.
[149:10.58]Hey!
[149:27.03]Okay, I do have to clear the whole road of this bullshit.
[149:31.33]I'm not doing it.
[149:31.87]I'm just clearing this part to drive over it.
[149:42.78]Do your classic Cookie Monster voice.
[149:46.32]Cookie Monsters like Tasmanian Devil.
[149:48.54]You have to go all in or it's not going to work.
[149:54.09]You can't do a Cookie Monster impression by just going like, No, no, no.
[149:57.65]You have to go all in.
[150:09.66]Please.
[150:10.04]Our four-wheel drive.
[150:10.66]Come on.
[150:12.95]I don't want to clear this whole thing.
[150:14.21]I just want to go.
[150:14.79]Maybe it'll unstuck me on the other side.
[150:22.44]You just put me on top of these.
[150:27.40]Wait.
[150:27.84]No, it worked.
[150:35.95]Oh my god.
[150:36.63]Come on.
[150:36.95]Unstuck it again.
[150:37.69]I'm already over the thing.
[150:38.79]I'm already there.
[150:45.97]There you go.
[150:46.23]Alright, we're good.
[150:50.27]So where do I want to set up shop here?
[150:54.53]Oh!
[150:56.79]Do a Cookie Monster impression now.
[150:59.13]I forget what Cookie Monster sounds like.
[151:03.33]It's like... It's like... But you need almost like a voice changer with it.
[151:12.08]Hold on.
[151:13.50]What does Cookie Monster sound like?
[151:17.23]It's like... What does it sound like?
[151:18.94]It's kind of like... Cookies.
[151:27.64]I love cookies, right?
[151:29.18]Something like that?
[151:31.21]I don't know.
[151:31.53]It's something like that.
[151:37.77]The problem is that I didn't go all in.
[151:40.15]Let me go all in with it and see what happens.
[151:45.23]This cookie is delicious.
[151:47.45]I love cookies.
[151:48.44]Oh, yes, cookies.
[151:51.60]That's not, that's not really, really not that good.
[151:53.64]But, I mean, it's, how do you even do it?
[151:59.28]It's so gravelly that it kind of hurts.
[152:02.92]That's just an orc.
[152:06.87]Dun, dun, dun building ship.
[152:10.87]Dun building ship.
[152:12.15]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[152:15.03]We need more gold!
[152:17.63]I'm done doing that.
[152:18.35]I'm not doing it ever fucking again for the rest of my life.
[152:26.14]None of you are going to hear that ever again.
[152:27.50]I promise.
[152:34.04]You know what it's the- Ow!
[152:36.58]It's the da da da part.
[152:38.72]I fucking hate that.
[152:39.82]Don't you?
[152:41.81]Like the... Right?
[152:44.67]It's like, shut up.
[152:45.35]I hate it.
[152:45.69]That's the worst impression.
[153:01.77]No, it's not.
[153:02.69]It's not even close.
[153:03.59]Alright, I gotta secure the area.
[153:09.93]Secure it.
[153:16.19]Left mouse button?
[153:19.65]I need to secure this area.
[153:20.61]Let's go.
[153:20.93]Secure it.
[153:22.49]Secure it.
[153:24.79]Secure it.
[153:31.92]I can't.
[153:32.24]I'm clicking.
[153:33.64]Secure it.
[153:35.08]Secure the area.
[153:35.70]Oh, there we go.
[153:36.38]Alright, we can skip this.
[153:38.76]I'm excited now.
[153:40.42]Now we can actually do the fun part.
[153:44.08]Why was I dropped out of the sky?
[153:52.11]Okay.
[153:54.03]Use your laptop to transport crates by drones.
[154:00.11]Oh, I can call the... Really?
[154:03.24]Well, let's just... Let's do this.
[154:04.08]Let's get started here.
[154:05.94]Other tool information.
[154:06.92]What about the other tools?
[154:09.04]Underwater fossil searching.
[154:10.34]Mm-hmm.
[154:16.60]Okay.
[154:19.87]Turn it on.
[154:20.95]Suck out all the water.
[154:24.71]Alright.
[154:26.19]Diving.
[154:27.33]Dry the area.
[154:28.07]Suck out all the water.
[154:30.65]Shallow water that blocks digging must be pumped out with a diesel water pump.
[154:33.73]Place it in the highlighted spot.
[154:34.94]Turn it on and wait until the water is completely pumped out.
[154:38.52]And then connect the lamp in case it gets dark out.
[154:41.02]And then you got a generator just in case it gets, um... You need electricity.
[154:48.01]Alright, other tools.
[154:48.75]Alright, let's go.
[154:51.41]Let's pump it up.
[155:01.53]Wait, I need my device, right?
[155:06.05]These have fossils in them?
[155:10.78]I'm fucking drowning.
[155:13.20]Okay.
[155:14.12]Okay, you can die.
[155:15.06]I need my, um... There's a death mechanic.
[155:25.30]You almost became a fossil.
[155:32.63]I need, um, my thing.
[155:41.23]Uh, where's the little Ghostbuster tool?
[155:47.31]Did I bring my Ghostbuster tool?
[155:49.03]There it is.
[156:01.22]I'm just gonna go clean him up and throw him over here.
[156:02.84]Just remember that's where those are.
[156:09.28]Alright, let's do an inspection here.
[156:19.43]Anything?
[156:24.51]Nope.
[156:24.89]What about the one I threw over here?
[156:28.29]Nope.
[156:30.29]No.
[156:31.31]No.
[156:31.61]Okay.
[156:32.31]I have to take him out and throw him.
[156:34.69]There's a giant gold nugget.
[156:35.71]What would that be worth?
[156:39.22]A gold nugget this big would be worth how much?
[156:50.65]Like a few million?
[156:51.51]Isn't this some asteroid or something that's worth like 50 trillion dollars in gold or something?
[157:06.37]Yes, there is.
[157:07.39]There is, right?
[157:08.19]Am I just making that up?
[157:17.47]I gotta check on these ones.
[157:24.58]My uncle has that asteroid.
[157:26.18]Are you serious?
[157:30.74]You're not even... You're not subscribed.
[157:51.43]What?
[157:52.44]This guy's got a net worth of like 50 trillion dollars!
[158:05.90]Alright, let me check these.
[158:06.62]But what if he doesn't like your stream?
[158:13.57]That's fair.
[158:14.87]What if he does, though?
[158:20.78]There's nothing in any of these shitty rocks.
[158:23.90]Something's moving in this one.
[158:24.74]This one's going to hatch.
[158:25.44]Okay, I don't want to get confused because I'll... My uncle learned how to do a kickflip last week.
[158:48.94]You're not subscribed either.
[158:55.46]Oh, you didn't celebrate your uncle's kickflip and subscribe here?
[158:59.60]Really?
[158:59.89]I don't think there's anything even down here.
[159:07.27]I'm just doing this for no reason.
[159:11.43]So uncool.
[159:12.23]Yeah, I mean, that's like not cool.
[159:20.92]I don't want to have to keep coming down here throwing rocks.
[159:22.72]Can I suck up all the water?
[159:31.82]One of these has to have something, right?
[159:39.93]Yeah!
[159:43.67]What is it?
[159:49.78]I can't identify it.
[160:03.11]Oh, he's having a monolog here.
[160:05.23]What's huge?
[160:05.61]What is it?
[160:06.21]What did you find?
[160:06.71]Alright.
[160:32.40]Is it gold?
[160:33.02]No, it's something actually pretty important, I think.
[160:35.44]I think it's important.
[160:36.12]Stromasaurus albertensis.
[160:42.43]...he arrived at the excavation site in person and confirmed my assumptions.
[160:46.79]What I found was part of... Oh, shit!
[160:48.97]My power might go up.
[160:50.27]It was an important enough discovery for a professor to reach out to media.
[160:53.49]Did you see that?

[165:01.30]Alright, that's a left limb.
[165:05.49]I don't have enough space.
[165:09.11]I need more crates.
[165:10.89]Um... Alright, well I have to... I gotta... What do I do with this?
[165:13.89]I can't... Hold on.
[165:17.95]You're such a teacher.
[165:24.36]I need to have a drone come pick it up.
[165:31.08]Wait.
[165:36.22]Can I just do it?
[165:41.88]No.
[165:43.66]How come you're so catty tonight?
[165:47.74]I don't know.
[165:48.34]What does that mean?
[165:49.14]Why am I so catty?
[165:54.56]Am I catty tonight?

[166:12.87]Okay.
[166:13.35]Well, I can at least store the other ones.
[166:14.65]I have to come back and upgrade or something.
[166:18.42]Can I put this on the roof?
[166:23.29]Dude, I can't even store this on the roof.

[166:55.79]Um, okay, so where do I get another pallet?
[166:57.61]Right here?
[167:00.79]Small crates, three to six.
[167:01.99]Large crates.
[167:03.29]I can't, I don't think I can pick these up.
[167:06.59]I think I actually have to drive that back.
[167:07.85]Call the drone?
[167:19.13]Yeah, I can't.
[167:20.43]I don't think I have it, like, unlocked.
[167:24.91]I don't think I have it unlocked.

[168:16.64]I don't know.
[168:18.16]I don't get it.
