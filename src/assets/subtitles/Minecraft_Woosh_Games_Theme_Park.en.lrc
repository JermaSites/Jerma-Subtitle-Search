[00:13.17]What?
[00:14.37]What?
[00:14.63]The lone cow.
[00:18.55]And the endless plains.
[00:20.59]What are you doing out here, man?
[00:21.89]Don't look at me like that.
[00:24.10]I'm gonna mess you up, cow.

[01:07.28]Why am I like... I'm like looking, I can't... How do I get back to first person?
[01:11.67]It's F... It's like F5 twice, you just hit it two more times.

[01:16.41]Alright, so what's the rules?
[01:20.13]Alright, each... Ow.
[01:21.81]Ow.
[01:23.52]Why you do that, man?
[01:25.07]I don't know.
[01:26.31]Read the rules, man.
[01:27.73]Alright, you read the rules.
[01:29.36]I'll look.
[01:30.67]okay so we don't have to reload maps because they reload themselves and each particular game there's a bunch of games that we're gonna be playing each one has a different set of rules some of them have pvp some of them don't and that's pretty much it we're going to the mini game section as you can see this is just a giant theme park there's a ton of spleef games and variants down there there's a giant sign that says fireworks
[01:58.50]Whoa!
[01:59.24]Fireworks, fireworks, fireworks!
[02:01.72]Are there really fireworks?
[02:02.92]I really want to know.
[02:04.52]I don't know what to do.
[02:05.52]So this is just a giant amusement park.
[02:07.78]I don't know what to do.
[02:09.04]Oh my god.
[02:10.48]It's completely open-ended.
[02:12.92]There's a McDonald's over there as well, yeah.
[02:15.79]The big giant Minecraft golden arches.
[02:18.79]Oh my god.
[02:22.53]McCrafties!
[02:24.25]Are you making the piano chirp?
[02:26.25]No.
[02:26.93]Do you hear that?
[02:28.65]There's a bird in here.
[02:30.11]Is this like the clerk?
[02:33.10]He's the one doing it.
[02:35.24]Can I order a double cheeseburger?
[02:37.50]Alright.
[02:38.88]Cooked chicken, steak, or cake.
[02:43.38]No double cheeseburgers.
[02:46.06]Goodbye.
[02:46.54]Goodbye, McFrafties.
[02:48.69]I'm taking a cake.
[02:51.31]I hear some pistons.
[02:54.45]And this is where it says take your order right here.
[02:57.40]And here it comes down the chute.
[02:59.42]I want a steak.
[03:00.60]Ding.
[03:01.26]Your order is ready, sir.
[03:04.13]Have a cake.
[03:04.53]I want a ton of steaks.
[03:06.43]I just made a floating cake, I think.
[03:09.75]Apologies.
[03:11.27]How did you?
[03:12.13]I made a floating cake.
[03:13.01]Oh yeah, here come the steaks.
[03:16.44]Steak, steak, steak.
[03:17.72]Oh, that was a chicken.
[03:18.98]I picked up your cake, too.
[03:20.74]Alright, here, you can have your cake.
[03:22.98]I promise I won't eat it.
[03:24.40]Visit our kitchen.
[03:27.44]So wait, this is cool.
[03:28.44]Alright, so what do you want to do first besides running into McCraftys?
[03:33.06]They've got all the animals locked up in the back in the slaughterhouse.
[03:36.94]That's so awful.
[03:38.12]That's so terrible.
[03:39.36]Okay, so we got the minigames over here, starting with Pig Rodeo, Piston Box, and it looks like I can barely see Dodge Bow down there.
[03:49.55]So do you just want to start and go down the row?
[03:52.19]Let's just go down the row, man.
[03:53.31]Let's do it.
[03:54.33]Alright, you're blue.
[03:55.33]I'll go blue.
[03:56.45]You take the blue line and just follow that line.
[03:59.87]Egg.
[04:00.07]Okay.
[04:02.56]So we can hit the pigs.
[04:03.50]Just don't kill your pig, man.
[04:06.06]So the goal is we're trying to kill each other's pigs, right?
[04:08.90]Right.
[04:09.32]The first person whose pig dies loses.
[04:13.24]Well, I hope you're ready to get destroyed.
[04:15.25]Because I'm a
[04:17.48]Oh, he's right here.
[04:18.34]Ride the pig and press I am ready to start.
[04:21.52]There's like, how come there's more than, there's like three pigs down here.
[04:24.40]Man, you are cheating hardcore.
[04:26.44]What is this?
[04:28.02]I don't have any pigs down there.
[04:29.70]Kill that pig that's in that pen.
[04:33.26]Oh, now I've got another pig.
[04:34.32]Okay, now it's even.
[04:35.12]Now it's even.
[04:37.44]How do you put the saddle on the pig?
[04:38.70]You just right click the pig with the saddle.
[04:41.65]I can't do it.
[04:42.19]He's like, he's more loving.
[04:45.63]I'm on my pig.
[04:47.06]He's like, this is not... Oh, there we go.
[04:48.39]Okay, there we go.
[04:49.25]And push the button.
[04:50.09]Ready?
[04:50.69]I am ready.
[04:51.45]Go.
[04:51.67]Uh-oh.
[04:52.95]My pig... My stealthy pig jumped up on top of the mob.
[04:56.23]So did yours.
[04:57.39]Wait, it... Let's go, pig.
[04:59.57]Alright, I'm gonna hit... Oh, there we go.
[05:01.67]I'm down.
[05:02.11]I'm down.
[05:02.39]I punched him.
[05:03.16]Oh, I punched my two.
[05:04.28]Okay, we gotta make him step on the pressure plates.
[05:06.64]Come on, pig.
[05:07.74]Me and you.
[05:08.86]Me and you, pig.
[05:09.84]Kill him.
[05:10.38]Kill his pig.
[05:12.00]Yeah, come on, pig.
[05:13.44]Get out of the corner.
[05:14.34]My pig is hiding in the corner.
[05:17.30]Did you kill your pig?
[05:20.82]Hey, looks like you won.
[05:23.36]Oh, it looks like I did win.
[05:24.87]Oh, I still have this pig.
[05:27.31]Not for long.
[05:30.49]Wait, did your pig die?
[05:34.07]No.
[05:35.31]So who won?
[05:37.33]I think you won.
[05:38.41]I think I won.
[05:40.67]Alright, well let's... You wanna do it one more time?
[05:42.85]Yeah, let's do it one more time.
[05:44.37]I'm trying to get on him.
[05:47.22]Oh no, he jumped on top of the thing again.
[05:48.88]No!
[05:48.96]No, you idiot!
[05:49.28]You stupid pig!
[05:50.24]I... He like climbed up on the mob spawner again.
[05:56.98]Yeah, he's on the mob spawner.
[05:58.58]Alright, just hit I am ready.
[06:00.18]Oh yeah, I hit it.
[06:01.88]See, I didn't hit mine.
[06:03.04]But you know what?
[06:03.94]You can't have it.
[06:05.10]Uh oh.
[06:05.46]Okay, I'm just gonna have to hit my pig.
[06:07.77]There we go.
[06:08.16]I'm down.
[06:09.72]I'm taking pig damage.
[06:11.80]I don't know what's going on.
[06:12.82]We're taking pig damage.
[06:14.52]Where are you?
[06:15.67]I don't know.
[06:17.75]I'm getting hit by this block of dirt that was above my head.
[06:21.33]Okay, we're both down here now.
[06:22.52]Come on, pig.
[06:23.72]Come on, pig.
[06:24.32]Oh, man, when the pig falls, okay, scrap that one.
[06:30.02]So what you're saying is I just, like, whooped your ass.
[06:34.12]Because my pig fell, like, ten feet, and so he took, like, all of his damage.
[06:39.51]And so I hit him once, and he died.
[06:41.05]Alright, well, this one seems to be glitched out.
[06:43.57]Let's go to the next one.
[06:45.69]Next game on the menu is Piston Boxy.
[06:50.15]Why not Piston Boxer?
[06:51.29]Hold on, I've got to throw some trash away.
[06:54.29]It's like raw meat to throw away.
[06:56.19]Yeah, I got like a ton of arrows to throw away.
[06:58.33]It's just like a fire.
[07:01.13]Lava trash cans.
[07:03.37]What a practical thing.
[07:06.13]Oh, here's your trash cans.
[07:07.03]It's just actually a lava pit.
[07:09.01]We need some more recycling cans around here, I think.
[07:11.75]Make sure your kid doesn't crawl in there.
[07:16.08]Okay, two players need it.
[07:17.26]Avoid punches.
[07:18.64]Knock your opponent down.
[07:20.90]Red Boxer, Brown Boxer.
[07:23.24]Doesn't really matter to me.
[07:26.17]Take your pick.
[07:27.59]So we're supposed to box each other?
[07:30.65]We're going to be pushing some kind of buttons to box.
[07:33.86]So it's like Rock'em Sock'em Robots.
[07:36.22]Except not.
[07:37.82]Alright, so I think I understand.
[07:39.20]Rock'em, sock'em, roll'em.
[07:40.18]Okay, fight.
[07:40.84]Fall into the white blocks, is what it says.
[07:42.94]Okay.
[07:44.14]I'm in some sort of arena now.
[07:46.24]So... I see you over there.
[07:48.34]Alright, so I think we have to punch each other.
[07:51.58]Whoever wins, wins, right?
[07:52.82]Apparently by pushing these buttons on the left and right.
[07:55.33]You ready?
[07:55.87]Alright, ready?
[07:57.03]Go.
[07:57.37]Go.
[07:58.87]Oh, I'm going to dodge him.
[08:02.40]Oh, no!
[08:03.00]That was coming on the... No!
[08:04.06]No!
[08:04.86]Oh, you pushed me off too.
[08:06.90]I don't know.
[08:07.78]I think you went off first.
[08:10.09]Oh, I did go off first.
[08:11.17]Gosh darn it.
[08:13.57]Ready!
[08:14.31]Steady!
[08:15.45]Fight!
[08:15.69]I'm just gonna like start... Oh my god!
[08:22.04]Victory!
[08:23.84]I lost.
[08:24.70]Whatever, let's go.
[08:26.30]Let's get out of here.
[08:27.14]Stop to see.
[08:28.16]I ran over to your side.
[08:30.58]Ow.
[08:32.88]Oh, look at this!
[08:34.42]That's Dodge Bow.
[08:36.77]Alright.
[08:38.09]Game number three is a PvP game.
[08:42.50]Play as needed at least two.
[08:45.16]Dodge arrows, shoot your opponent.
[08:46.98]You wanna read the rules?
[08:49.39]Welcome to dodgeball.
[08:51.27]It's like playing dodgeball, but instead of a ball, you shoot flaming arrows that will push the opponent against lava.
[08:57.11]How terrible.
[08:58.35]The player who dies loses the game.
[09:00.36]By pressing the pressure plate, you get bonus items.
[09:02.62]Okay.
[09:03.96]So the yellow line is for people to watch.
[09:06.04]Alright, don't leave your side.
[09:08.88]I don't want to see any cheating from you.
[09:10.34]Oh, hey now.
[09:12.70]I resent that slap on my face.
[09:16.12]Alright, have fun.
[09:18.20]I'm gonna go iron, you go lapis.
[09:21.42]Lapis lazuli.
[09:24.78]I'm ready, waiting for opponent.
[09:27.32]Ready.
[09:29.20]Alright, so the blocks are gonna go down and we've got a couple chests here that we're gonna have to use to armor up and get some ammo.
[09:38.05]Golden apples.
[09:38.91]I keep taking boots.
[09:42.69]Why is there so much armor?
[09:44.01]There's so much armor.
[09:45.61]I guess because when you die, all your items fall in the lava.
[09:49.11]Why am I fraternizing with the enemy here?
[09:51.60]Supposed to be shooting you.
[09:52.96]Yeah, but I got golden apples.
[09:55.34]You can't kill me.
[09:56.36]Oh, yeah?
[09:56.96]I don't think so.
[09:58.38]I'm going to find a way.
[10:00.90]Alright.
[10:01.72]So this is what we do.
[10:02.42]Let's do it.
[10:05.17]Oh!
[10:05.39]Oh!
[10:05.59]Sneak attack!
[10:06.85]Sneak attack!
[10:07.83]Are they on fire?
[10:08.59]The arrows are on fire!
[10:10.95]Oh no, I'm in the lava!
[10:11.75]Oh god, I can't see anything!
[10:12.73]I can't see!
[10:13.83]Where am I?
[10:14.31]You're in the lava.
[10:16.30]I don't even know where I am.
[10:17.48]Just hold jump.
[10:18.80]Am I in the lava?
[10:20.02]Yeah, but I'm still hitting you, even though I'm telling you what to do.
[10:23.04]Oh god, it's the wall, the wall's a lava!
[10:26.16]Yeah.
[10:27.10]Oh god.
[10:29.31]No, I refuse defeat!
[10:30.55]Okay.
[10:33.77]No!
[10:34.41]Wow.
[10:35.03]Oh wow, this is some crazy knockback.
[10:40.35]Oh, it's just like the Huntsman.
[10:42.31]It is just like the Huntsman.
[10:43.33]Okay.
[10:43.93]Run!
[10:44.49]No!
[10:46.15]Oh, Dodge, I'm going to drink my potion.
[10:47.81]You can't do nothing about it.
[10:49.68]I'm drinking mine, too.
[10:50.80]You thought you were the only one with a potion?
[10:54.12]You were wrong.
[10:55.10]I can't see anything.
[10:56.72]I'm going up for a good shot in the front.
[11:00.14]Oh, push him into the lava.
[11:01.46]Nice shot right there.
[11:03.19]Help me!
[11:06.11]I'm not holding it down long enough.
[11:08.17]Okay.
[11:08.27]Okay.
[11:09.51]Don't!
[11:10.73]Are we not supposed to play on peaceful?
[11:12.35]Is that the problem here?
[11:13.19]I think we're just regaining our health back.
[11:18.83]Oh, why'd you shoot me?
[11:19.65]Don't worry, I'm gonna get it all back.
[11:20.83]Oh, I'm coming to your side!
[11:22.89]Get out of here.
[11:24.97]Push him back.
[11:26.82]Oh wow, you just went straight back into the lava.
[11:30.68]Oh my god, I can't even get up.
[11:34.59]Alright, I'm gonna get you, man.
[11:36.01]I'm gonna get you.
[11:38.08]I'm coming to your side, I'm gonna stop punching you.
[11:42.80]These arrows, man.
[11:46.38]Ah, I hit you with my potion juice.
[11:48.20]Breaking the rules.
[11:49.74]What is this?
[11:51.06]Breaking the rules, breaking the rules.
[11:53.96]I'm gonna probably die before you.
[11:55.20]Push him in my own lava.
[12:00.24]Jumping crit.
[12:02.74]I'm dead.
[12:04.21]It's over.
