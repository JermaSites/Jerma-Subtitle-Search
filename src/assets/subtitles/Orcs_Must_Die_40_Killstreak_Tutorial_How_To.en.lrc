[00:01.41]Hey, what's happening, guys?
[00:02.69]Jerma here again with a gameplay commentary.
[00:05.23]This time I'm going to be playing Orcs Must Die.
[00:08.51]I'm going to give you guys a tutorial, I guess, a how-to to get your 30 and 40 killstreak achievements.
[00:16.44]This is how I did it.
[00:17.42]This is the easiest way that I saw to do it.
[00:19.62]You might have a better way, but this is how I got mine done.
[00:22.74]We're playing on Chokepoint right now.
[00:24.86]That is the name of the map.
[00:26.56]It is the best place to do this because as the title of the level says, you are going to make a funnel of people to all get stuffed into one small area so you can smoke every single one of them down in less than five seconds.
[00:41.71]Very, very minimalistic thing I'm doing here.
[00:44.07]Only picking two traps and one spell.
[00:48.19]I mean, really, this is all you're going to need.
[00:50.83]If you think you need more than this, just watch the remainder of this video.
[00:53.97]Watch how I absolutely destroy every single thing in this level.
[00:58.88]The weavers that I have, I have the elemental weaver, and the only thing you're going to need is that top right ability, that mana conservation ability.
[01:07.85]What that's going to allow you to do is cast four fireballs rather than three, which is absolutely essential to be able to overcome that 30 and 40 killstreak mark.
[01:19.40]Remember, we're going for 40 kills in a row.
[01:22.44]So what you want to do is take a look at what I'm doing right here.
[01:25.76]I'm using the barricades and the tar pits.
[01:28.62]I'm putting the barricades in a position where they have to go on the right side.
[01:32.93]And eventually I'm going to have two to three more tar pits going up the side there, which is going to force them all to just slug down the right side.
[01:42.17]And once you get them all in the right position, you're going to do this.
[01:45.54]spam fireballs down the right side.
[01:48.06]You will kill at least 20 people in the first couple waves.
[01:51.80]Where this gets insane is once you get up to the sixth, seventh, and eighth wave, when there are literally dozens and dozens and dozens of orcs pouring out.
[02:02.97]That is where you're going to get your money maker right there.
[02:05.77]You're going to make this line keep going all the way to the back.
[02:09.47]And eventually you're going to have so much money that you don't know what to do with it and just drop random stuff all over the place.
[02:15.83]You'll see later on I put tar traps just everywhere because I have nowhere to put them.
[02:21.53]So if you see here, watch, I'll show you again.
[02:23.25]Here they come.
[02:24.17]Not shooting any of them.
[02:25.39]I'm letting all of them get right here.
[02:27.27]Right stacked up right here.
[02:28.73]And then bang, bang, bang.
[02:30.47]That was 38 right there. 39.
[02:32.99]So here we are continuing what I was talking about right here, making them, force them to go down this one line.
[02:39.06]They are all gonna have to bunch up right here, putting another tar trap right there.
[02:43.05]Everybody's gonna have to come through here, and guys, this is pretty much it.
[02:46.93]This is all you have to do to get this, and five star this, by the way.
[02:50.77]This is an easy five star.
[02:53.18]As long as you have good accuracy on taking out the ogres like this right here, he's going to be slowed down as well.
[02:59.16]So as long as you can make the headshots count like I'm doing right here, you're not going to have a problem with anything in this level at all.
[03:05.77]You're just going to be able to farm these kills until you get your achievement.
[03:10.83]So the best wave to do this on is wave 8.
[03:13.63]Wave 8 has the sheer most amount of orcs in the entire level.
[03:17.76]And as you'll see here, I have not shot one person with the crossbow, just waiting for them all to pile into this little area.
[03:25.43]And here we go, you'll see it, I'll get it right here.
[03:28.23]Three...
[03:30.29]2, 1, here we go.
[03:31.93]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[03:34.69]42, 43 kills.
[03:36.26]That should get you your achievements for your killstreaks.
[03:39.06]Absolutely fantastic.
[03:40.20]That's a good way to 5-star a level 2.
[03:43.02]Ending this up right here, this is the last wave.
[03:45.16]I end up putting a few more barricades down and some more tar pits, just in case something goes wrong, which it definitely will not.
[03:51.98]So when I drop them down, I'm gonna put them over to the left side, make sort of an L shape.
[03:56.97]So that forces any orcs that happen to get by to go in one direction rather than split up and go all kinds of all over the place.
[04:04.69]So when the gates open you will see I spend absolute zero time worrying about any of the orcs.
[04:09.61]I'm just going to kill the ogre.
[04:11.83]Try to get as many headshots on him as I can because I know when he bunches up here he will die from the flames.
[04:17.54]And a second ogre comes out too so you want to make sure that one is pretty much dead and gone before they all come out.
[04:22.82]Here we go.
[04:23.34]That's it.
[04:24.22]39 kills right there.
[04:24.92]Didn't get the 40, but I got it before.
[04:27.02]Just cleaning up shop here right now.
[04:28.55]Got this last ogre to take care of.
[04:30.61]Then I've got a small line of orcs, but they are not going anywhere.
[04:33.87]They're not even halfway down the line yet.
[04:36.53]So I hope you guys enjoyed this video teaching you how to get your 30 and 40 killstreaks and a 5-star this level.
[04:42.38]This is choke point, by the way, on War Mage difficulty.
[04:45.94]So take care, everybody.
[04:47.38]See you all next time.
