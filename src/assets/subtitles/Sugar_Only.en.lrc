[00:20.37]Hi guys!
[00:25.37]We're gonna continue playing... The Salt of the Sanctuary.
[00:37.00]I think this is where I need to be.
[00:41.85]In fact, I'm almost 1000% certain that I need to be in this area.
[00:48.73]Bleeding Scars...
[00:54.71]And on that note... I'll claim the sanctuary in the name... of... I don't know... Jehovah!
[01:07.58]Super doors?
[01:08.18]No.
[01:13.52]I was actually working on an emote last night.
[01:17.15]And I typically judge how much I like an emote by how much I laugh at it while I'm making it.
[01:24.49]And this one got the gold medal.
[01:27.03]It did.
[01:28.29]This one got the actual gold medal.
[01:31.35]But, unfortunately, I can't, like, get it to show up right.
[01:39.42]But it's being worked on.
[01:41.28]Oh, there's invisible people I forgot.
[01:45.22]Forgot the invisible dumb enemy here.
[01:57.05]Oh, fuck.
[02:02.29]Where is he?
[02:07.90]Why do I feel like these enemies are actually supposed to be... have a model, but it's just something broke?
[02:14.44]Anybody else get the feeling that that's what's happening?
[02:18.14]No?
[02:18.62]Is it supposed to be sugar only?
[02:20.14]I'm not supposed to get angry today.
[02:22.43]Only sugar.
[02:26.53]I'm already getting angry.
[02:29.05]This is supposed to be a nice fucking hangout stream.
[02:33.06]Oh my god.
[02:38.26]I don't even care about the thing on the left.
[02:50.19]Is this assault kicking in?
[02:52.49]Yeah.
[02:53.39]It is.
[02:54.81]It's kicking in alright.
[02:59.35]Pitchfire.
[03:00.13]These things fall.
[03:05.75]Have I gone this way?
[03:07.12]No, there's a chest over here.
[03:11.90]Scorpion.
[03:12.86]The Scorpion King.
[03:13.68]Let's take a look.
[03:20.69]I think this might be... Class 4 Light Armor.
[03:25.65]Ah, the French Champagne.
[03:28.59]has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[03:32.61]Chocolate Tom, thanks for two months.
[03:38.46]I'm going to have to go down that road.
[03:39.80]Appreciate it, though.
[03:42.98]You've been subbed to the channel as long as I have pretty much been.
[03:46.86]I'd say this is the two or three month period where I've been streaming at least a few times a week.
[03:55.05]Ah, the fresh champagne.
[03:58.69]Hey, Yiggles!
[04:02.23]Yiggles with the resub.
[04:03.29]You guys know Yiggles, right?
[04:04.97]He's the dude that has my exact matchmaking rating in Overwatch.
[04:09.04]We play, like, every game together for some reason.
[04:15.24]Welcome back.
[04:15.64]Thanks, dude.
[04:18.64]Merchant's gloves?
[04:19.52]Oh, boy.
[04:20.00]Hold on.
[04:24.89]There it is.
[04:31.09]An ornate felt cap with my merchants.
[04:38.45]So is this thing any good?
[04:39.37]Arcane defense?
[04:43.43]I have a feeling I need to put this on at some point here.
[04:45.19]It's coming up soon.
[04:46.39]Because why would they give me arcane defense?
[04:50.79]There's probably a boss over here that shoots blazer beams or something.
[04:54.27]So I'm going to assume it's like that for the rest of it.
[04:56.76]Big dude.
[04:57.64]Okay.
[05:08.04]Okay, I want to just take a look because it might just be the hat too.
[05:12.12]Let's see Holy as well It's a lot of armor in this game There's a lot of choices I get overwhelmed by choices oh shit Okay
[05:38.00]You had to give me a double whammy here.
[05:43.77]Here we go.
[05:47.35]Oh, God.
[05:50.95]Oh!
[06:00.60]Raise your hand.
[06:02.10]Raise your hand if you think that's fucking stupid.
[06:04.96]Mine's up in the air right now.
[06:06.30]I hope a lot of you have your hand in the air.
[06:14.13]Raise your fucking hand if you think invisible enemies are stupid.
[06:16.63]Give me a break.
[06:24.78]God, teacher, call on me.
[06:26.28]I have an answer.
[06:26.96]Now I'm just mad.
[06:29.92]I'm, like, angry.
[06:30.72]I can't even, like, play the game anymore.
[06:33.99]Can't even go this way.
[06:42.67]Okay, well, note to self.
[06:44.14]Keep that in mind.
[06:46.06]When I eventually get back there.
[06:55.24]That shit is so fucking dumb.
[06:56.58]At least let me, like, see them somehow.
[07:00.15]Fucking, all this sugar's gone.
[07:01.93]It's, I ate it all.
[07:16.26]Okay, they do so much damage too.
[07:17.68]Look at how much these guys are fucking rocking me.
[07:23.63]And I don't even... God.
[07:31.99]Stupidest fucking thing.
[07:33.52]I have a new enemy that I hate.
[07:36.16]You know, the one that you can't see.
[07:54.92]Hmm, books.
[08:01.95]Big guy.
[08:10.17]Oh, shit, I forgot to tweet this.
[08:11.19]I forgot to tweet it.
[08:12.65]It was a tweet that I was streaming.
[08:19.69]Okay, here we go.
[08:27.67]Did I get them all?
[08:30.50]Dumbass ghost enemies.
[08:35.24]Oh!
[08:35.50]I didn't... God damn it!
[08:45.03]Will you get away from me, please?
[08:56.36]Holy shit.
[08:58.10]That's gonna keep happening here.
[08:59.97]Isn't it?
[09:01.03]Ooh, there's a little skip over there.
[09:06.07]I gotta get all the way around there.
[09:07.07]There's one right there.
[09:16.21]Yup.
[09:22.68]Holy shit.
[09:24.14]He's still alive.
[09:24.66]I didn't kill this one.
[09:29.72]You've got to be shitting me.
[09:35.14]You've got to be, absolutely.
[09:36.85]Well, I found a sanctuary.
[09:50.73]That's good enough, I guess.
[09:55.79]Ah, the French champagne.
[09:59.52]has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[10:03.44]Joking kill.
[10:04.26]Five months.
[10:06.99]The killing joke.
[10:08.65]The Joker.
[10:10.03]Thanks a lot.
[10:10.35]Appreciate it.
[10:11.35]Welcome back.
[10:13.25]After five months of time.
[10:16.83]You've been subscribed for a very long time.
[10:27.69]I thought I could... Nope.
[10:37.05]Really?
[10:37.35]Come on.
[10:48.17]I'm so concerned about the invisible guys.
[10:50.21]There's a boss right here.
[10:54.87]Oh, the movie theater!
[10:56.12]What movie we're gonna watch?
[10:58.70]The Untouched Inquisitor.
[11:00.38]Uh-oh, he's got saw blades for hands.
[11:05.00]Oh, here we go.
[11:05.64]Okay, he's just... This guy's just a wine opener.
[11:13.03]That's all he is.
[11:14.99]Watch me beat the wine opener in, like, the first try.
[11:17.57]Uh-oh.
[11:43.70]It's going to block.
[11:46.96]No, I was trying to... I'm not actually sure what I was trying to do there.
[11:50.66]Oof.
[12:17.66]Why did that take longer?
[12:18.62]Go open a fucking wine bottle somewhere.
[12:21.60]Listen to me, son.
[12:25.27]I'm your dad.
[12:27.67]Destroy him!
[12:31.09]Whoa!
[12:38.21]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[12:45.58]Marshall8642, welcome.
[12:49.06]Uh, whoa!
[12:50.98]And Cheesy Cheeseburger just resubscribed.
[12:58.10]Yeah, Paul Bear is back in a much more condensed form.
[13:04.27]I just like that clip because of the... Whoa!
[13:08.61]Then, uh, welcome.
[13:09.15]Thanks for subbing.
[13:11.01]Where's the trash man?
[13:12.09]We do, like, different sub sounds here every, like, four days.
[13:15.67]Don't worry.
[13:16.09]He'll make a return.
[13:17.05]They always make a return.
[13:24.30]is the skip.
[13:25.04]Crystal, I got a new ring too.
[13:33.27]Marsha, that was, oh my god, that was purely worth the five dollars.
[13:39.21]I wonder how many times Paul Bearer has said destroy him in a different place.
[13:43.07]I got lightning damage defense.
[13:46.52]That last boss was actually, the last two bosses have been kind of painfully easy.
[13:51.24]I've noticed
[13:55.96]But I don't think I need lightning damage right now.
[14:03.11]I do need to get back to a... Louis the Cashew with the resub.
[14:12.11]There's probably going to be a lot of resubs.
[14:13.73]I think this is when... This is like the one month kind of anniversary for a lot of people.
[14:21.18]Fire damage.
[14:22.58]Is there like lightning damage one?
[14:24.25]Yeah, give me the lightning.
[14:25.95]I can't see.
[14:26.45]Oh, that sucks.
[14:29.29]I like being able to see better.
[14:32.96]I'm going to go back because I want to level up.
[14:41.54]I have a lot of salt.
[14:43.26]I have a lot of bags of salt, too, that I need to get rid of.
[14:45.78]So I'm going to do that as well.
[14:50.63]There's a sanctuary right back here.
[14:54.17]Oh, I forgot to tweet that.
[14:55.97]I needed to tell people that I was streaming.
[14:58.95]I always forget to do this.
[15:03.37]Because I get a lot of people telling me, I didn't know you were streaming.
[15:07.48]So, Twitter is the best place to do it.
[15:10.10]I'm never going to do a YouTube video for it.
[15:13.26]I feel like that just kind of clogs up subscription feeds.
[15:17.98]So, I'm not going to do it.
[15:20.64]Streaming.
[15:27.97]I can set this up so it does it automatically, I think, right?
[15:31.31]Through Twitch.
[15:41.36]Oh, the French champagne.
[15:44.44]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[15:49.81]Listen to me, son!
[15:52.31]I'm your dad!
[15:54.75]Destroy him!
[15:59.05]Silver Shadow!
[15:59.99]Whoa!
[16:01.43]Silver Shadow, welcome, thanks.
[16:03.97]Welcome to the family.
[16:05.15]Listen to me, son!
[16:07.67]I'm your dad!
[16:10.09]Destroy him!
[16:13.51]Whoa!
[16:17.35]Read my letter, welcome.
[16:18.81]Thanks for subbing.
[16:24.17]I've seen you around the chat, Red.
[16:27.32]Appreciate it.
[16:30.52]Whoa!
[16:30.92]Alright, where's the sanctuary here?
[16:37.28]Is it here or... No, it's up here.
[16:43.79]What is that from?
[16:44.41]That is Paul Bearer.
[16:45.49]That's Paul Bearer.
[16:57.03]From WWF.
[16:58.85]Not WWE.
[16:59.77]We're talking WWF.
[17:08.74]I had some heavy armor here that I could put on, but I need to unlock it.
[17:15.52]Class 2 heavy armor.
[17:17.28]Yeah, I'm going to do this.
[17:19.08]There's a lot of options that I have, and I'm doing strength.
[17:22.77]Big two-hander guy might as well do that as well.
[17:26.74]You know, I might as well do that as well.
[17:29.08]How many times can you say well in one sentence?
[17:31.52]And then I was going to go up here.
[17:33.42]Because there is... Another healing pouch.
[17:38.80]Oh, I'm going to burp again.
[17:40.06]Fuck.
[17:41.20]Okay.
[17:47.83]So now I'm not so scared of going the rest of the way.
[17:49.81]I have so much money.
[17:52.99]I have a lot of money.
[17:58.64]Not in real life, in fake life.
[17:59.92]Isn't that great when you can look down and see that I have like $60,000 in my bank account?
[18:05.74]Imagine if that was real.
[18:06.54]Imagine you actually had $60,000 in your checking account.
[18:11.04]God, the amount of things that I would buy.
[18:13.40]I'd buy like... Sadness?
[18:20.20]I wouldn't buy Sadness.
[18:21.14]You can't purchase that.
[18:23.78]I'd buy... What would I buy with like $20,000?
[18:26.68]I know exactly what I'd buy.
[18:30.27]I would hire a ton of actors to come fill my house for like, I'd hire like a hundred people to come like have a party at my house and I'd like film it and be like, I would make my own shitty party high schooler movie.
[18:45.70]You know, like those ones that exist like, oh, 21 and over.
[18:49.52]I'd make that.
[18:50.94]Except it'd be like my own version of it.
[18:53.72]Oh, I opened this door.
[18:54.44]Let me do this.
[19:00.15]Let's go up.
[19:05.13]And like the cops would show up and it'd be like, oh, cops are here!
[19:07.63]Woo!
[19:08.15]Oh, whoa!
[19:11.25]Oh shit, more.
[19:15.06]These ones are invisible.
[19:17.90]These are invisible shock jockers.
[19:19.28]31 and over.
[19:28.14]And then here's the funny part, like when like finally when like the police show up and they're like, okay, we're going to calm this down here, guys.
[19:34.66]I can just be like, look, none of these people are real and they'd all just leave.
[19:39.19]And I'd show them all like the release forms and like there was no party.
[19:43.07]And those, the police would be like, what the fuck is wrong with you?
[19:45.97]I'd be like, lots of things.
[19:49.11]And then everybody would leave and I would just, I'd upload, I'd upload like, you know, what's the title of that video?
[19:55.84]The Party of the Century.
[19:59.35]There'd be no alcohol.
[20:01.89]Nobody was allowed to do any recreational drugs.
[20:05.25]Everyone just had to sit down and just like, and stare at the wall.
[20:09.91]A hundred people.
[20:11.47]And like, you know, some people would be coughing and there'd be like a board game that one of us would be playing.
[20:21.18]You'd spend $60 for a shitty joke?
[20:24.14]You'd spend $60 for a shitty joke?
[20:26.30]Well...
[20:28.58]Well, don't you want to know what I'd spend money on?
[20:31.27]Maybe soon you'll figure that out.
[20:34.85]Maybe soon, one day here.
[20:36.13]I'm putting on the lightning resist.
[20:43.79]I'm doing it.
[20:44.81]I know that this is going to be like a lightning area, I can already tell.
[20:46.95]Does this have lightning?
[20:51.87]I need lightning.
[20:58.86]It's 12.
[21:06.64]Eventually here, people are going to think that I am an insane person.
[21:10.14]And in fact, I think a lot of you already do think that.
[21:13.87]We'll see.
[21:14.89]We'll see!
[21:15.53]Oh, look at this!
[21:19.45]What?
[21:21.71]How is this a class 2 heavy armor?
[21:26.35]You're talking about me going shirtless?
[21:28.75]Is class 2 heavy armor?
[21:37.53]Okay, well.
[21:39.91]I'm curious how that works.
[21:44.81]Lightning, lightning, lightning, lightning.
[21:47.27]This one's a 9.
[21:48.59]13, 9.
[21:58.15]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[22:05.58]Hitman 109.
[22:08.16]Hitman 109, 109.
[22:09.46]Two months.
[22:11.34]Welcome back, thanks.
[22:13.34]Thanks for your continued purchasing of the subscription feature of twitch.tv.
[22:22.40]I don't care.
[22:23.72]Somebody said there was a helm that had more?
[22:34.63]This one's 18.
[22:35.27]This is class 1 light armor.
[22:36.93]I can't put it on.
[22:42.17]Nah, I'll just stay with what I got.
[22:44.01]I might not even be able to walk like this.
[22:45.91]What's my weight at right now?
[22:48.61]Yeah.
[22:48.79]What the hell is so heavy here?
[22:56.73]Let's go back to this, put the mask on.
[22:59.07]Nope.
[23:05.18]53 out of 50.
[23:07.64]Chain gauntlets, I'll take off the chain gauntlets.
[23:17.29]Put the chef's hat on, no.
[23:20.56]the Jester Crown back on.
[23:22.90]I want to keep on the Warden's thing, though.
[23:25.95]I need points on Endurance.
[23:28.09]Ah, damn.
[23:33.17]And we'll go back to the skirt.
[23:34.97]Okay, that works.
[23:37.41]Your chest piece is so heavy.
[23:38.50]Yeah, that's what I don't understand.
[23:39.80]I think it's because I'm just so... I'm not seeing why this should weigh this much because it's my bare chest.
[23:45.84]There's invisible people over there.
[23:50.87]They're over here now.
[23:52.03]They're on top of me.
[23:55.51]They're on top of me.
[24:01.19]I need to go back to that sanctuary that was over here.
[24:04.93]I might actually find another one.
[24:10.14]I'm holding back a scream because I hate those enemies.
[24:17.92]I can't think of what you could possibly do that's worse than put a 4% opacity enemy in a game that is as dark as this game is that they can kill you in two swings.
[24:31.47]I can't, I can't, I'm trying to think of something that could be worse than that.
[24:35.48]I can't.
[24:42.18]You know, sometimes you just can't think of anything worse.
[24:47.22]Do I think Dark Souls 3 is going to be more like Dark Souls 1, 2, or Bloodborne?
[24:50.26]I hope it's more like Bloodborne.
[24:52.02]It looks like it's more Bloodborne-esque.
[24:59.18]Because I am one of those people that am not a huge fan of Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2.
[25:06.13]But I am a monumental fan of Bloodborne.
[25:09.15]It's actually one of my favorite video games ever made.
[25:13.71]I absolutely can say that now with complete safety, Bloodborne is one of my favorite single-player games ever.
[25:19.33]But I cannot say that about Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2.
[25:33.18]I want to just bait the invisible people over here.
[25:35.78]Okay, hopefully they're all dead.
[25:39.90]I think they are.
[25:45.26]I should be able to parry that shit.
[25:46.70]That's dumb.
[25:48.54]This is three times in a row.
[25:50.48]You can do that three times in a row.
[25:52.16]Worst enemy in the game.
[26:00.88]Did I beat Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2?
[26:02.58]Oh, shit.
[26:11.94]Polo Juice.
[26:13.40]Welcome.
[26:14.00]Thanks for subbing.
[26:15.45]Criken Helm and Criken Greaves.
[26:19.11]Polo Juice.
[26:21.45]What's the sub?
[26:24.21]No, I never beat Dark Souls or Dark Souls 2.
[26:26.59]I tried to go back like four times.
[26:29.87]I had like at least three or four different times in my life the last couple years where I've tried to play the games.
[26:35.62]I've tried to.
[26:36.34]As hard as I could.
[26:39.57]but I just can't do it.
[26:43.32]I think it's because when I play Bloodborne, Bloodborne is such a... The engine's way better.
[26:49.34]It's just the way that you move, the way that you dodge, and the way you swing, and the hit detection, and the character animations.
[26:56.50]I just... And then I go play Dark Souls, and I feel like I'm being... I feel like a piece of wood.
[27:01.47]All the characters in Dark Souls 1 compared to Bloodborne, to me, feel like they're made out of wood and clay.
[27:07.73]How do I get this?
[27:09.81]Can I, like, just jump down and grab?
[27:12.29]I'm sure I can, but is it worth me dying right now?
[27:14.23]I probably have to jump from here and then over there.
[27:17.13]I'll try it.
[27:18.59]I got a stone guide.
[27:20.29]Not really worth it.
[27:23.99]But this is going up, I guess.
[27:26.81]I, too, never beat Dark Souls, I feel you.
[27:30.11]It's not that I never wanted to or had no intention to beat it or anything.
[27:32.83]It's just was... I just wasn't a fan.
[27:36.99]Not a fan in the sense of the game.
[27:38.45]Like, I love the game.
[27:39.37]Obviously, like, Bloodborne and Dark Souls are nearly identical twins with a few different things that are changed.
[27:46.65]But there are differences that make it so Bloodborne is, like, one of my favorite games ever made.
[27:53.08]And Dark Souls is like, eh, they're kind of good.
[27:56.04]French champagne.
[27:56.86]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[28:02.67]Sketchy Dragon.
[28:03.41]With the resub, welcome back.
[28:07.50]Thank you for two months.
[28:09.54]Ooh, that is where the skip is.
[28:11.13]That's a good one.
[28:12.41]That's a good elevator skip.
[28:16.57]That one goes up.
[28:18.13]I like it.
[28:24.03]I wish I could play Bloodborne.
[28:24.95]Yeah, it's really... I wish you could too.
[28:30.48]It's a sad thing that literally one of the best games I've ever played
[28:37.68]Cannot be played by more than a handful of, like, not a handful, like a percentage of people.
[28:44.73]In regards to it being only PS4.
[28:46.01]There's another boss right here.
[28:50.53]Hold on a second.
[28:52.54]I want to get the sanctuary before I do this.
[28:55.28]Because there's a potential I could just die here.
[29:06.49]And you know what also resonated with me a lot?
[29:09.45]The theme of Bloodborne.
[29:12.85]Just the characters.
[29:15.05]The way... Actually, I want to go back up.
[29:17.47]Where is the sanctuary here?
[29:18.65]I forget.
[29:20.91]The storyline, the setting, the Lovecraftian atmosphere that Bloodborne has.
[29:25.02]It's just so good.
[29:31.23]I'm trying to remember if it was up and to the left or right.
[29:33.45]Where the fuck is it?
[29:35.21]I always forget what the little mini ones are.
[29:37.43]For some reason, I want to say it's over here.
[29:40.51]I don't feel like walking all the way again.
[29:43.63]I need to go back up, I guess, because I can't grab this.
[29:51.23]Or can I?
[29:51.71]No.
[29:52.68]I'm not making that jump.
[29:58.64]How do I feel about this game compared to Dark Souls and Bloodborne?
[30:03.42]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[30:12.24]Hypothermic.
[30:14.24]With a resub.
[30:15.24]Welcome back, Hypo.
[30:18.22]You talented man, you.
[30:21.61]It's good.
[30:21.97]I mean, it'll scratch the itch for you.
[30:25.09]Let's just say that.
[30:28.91]If you're looking for a Dark Souls before Dark Souls 3 comes out, I would say this is a game you should be playing.
[30:42.90]Weak to holy.
[30:43.52]I didn't even go this way.
[30:45.08]Did I?
[30:47.34]Oh, fuck.
[30:50.16]They're chasing me through the books.
[30:50.98]I don't even know which direction they're facing.
[30:56.27]Come on!
[30:57.14]Come on!
[30:58.12]Fuck off!
[31:00.32]Such dumb shit.
[31:03.77]And where are they now?
[31:05.93]VH1, where are they now?
[31:07.61]They're behind you.
[31:25.63]Step on his head.
[31:30.03]I'm so concerned right now about this shit.
[31:31.75]I just wanna... There it is.
[31:34.45]Okay.
[31:38.69]Found it.
[31:43.81]Found it again.
[31:44.29]Alright, now... Watch out for the stupid invisible enemies.
[31:59.69]Oh, do it again.
[32:00.53]He did it again.
[32:03.65]I can just climb up and it should be right here, right?
[32:07.00]Jerma police say, door, door 213.
[32:09.38]I said it.
[32:10.60]Door, door.
[32:12.22]Door.
[32:20.68]It's a new weapon.
[32:25.38]Magic scaling, that's a staff.
[32:28.00]Whatever.
[32:30.21]Not into it.
[32:40.17]Don't overdo it.
[32:46.27]Why am I shit... Why am I... What's going on?
[32:48.07]What did I do wrong?
[32:50.26]Is this the second one of these?
[32:57.78]Come on.
[33:04.78]That scream.
[33:06.90]Here comes the other invisible people.
[33:15.73]Fuck off!
[33:18.73]There's gotta be a better way to get up there, right?
[33:24.73]Where did I do the elevator?
[33:25.93]I don't even remember where the fuck that was, no.
[33:27.43]Oh, it's over here.
[33:35.13]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its sexiness.
[33:40.97]Scooty booty.
[33:44.14]Scooty booty.
[33:47.10]Welcome back.
[33:48.78]Yeah, there are a lot of resubs.
[33:49.88]Well, when I first started really getting into streaming was like two months ago, so yeah.
[33:55.18]Alright, let's see what happens here.
[33:57.24]I don't know what's going to happen, but this is a boss.
[34:00.72]Um.
[34:02.10]Prepare to die.
[34:03.10]It's a bird.
[34:08.02]It's a parakeet.
[34:09.10]It's a parrot with a dragon tail.
[34:13.12]You are an odd looking guy.
[34:14.68]He's a scorpion parakeet gorilla man.
[34:22.64]Okay, so he does that, he does this.
[34:26.06]Poison?
[34:26.62]Yeah, it's poison.
[34:33.94]I'm doing a lot of different things.
[34:36.16]Oh boy.
[34:38.60]Okay.
[34:39.22]Can I avoid these?
[34:43.72]No, not really.
[34:44.60]I have to go around them if I want to avoid them.
[34:48.44]He's got a very odd hitbox, by the way.
[34:51.28]It's like right in front of his foot.
[34:58.07]Oof.
[34:58.79]Okay, he does like this little shake, shake, shake before he... See?
[35:02.03]Ah, it's not cool.
[35:05.70]You see what I'm talking about?
[35:06.78]I was getting... That's so annoying.
[35:11.89]This guy has got a fucking... It's like his hitbox starts way in front, like right here.
[35:22.88]So it's hard to even dodge through him.
[35:25.04]So maybe I can't dodge through him.
[35:26.30]Maybe I shouldn't even be trying to do that.
[35:36.18]I'm gonna die.
[35:38.40]It's been nice knowing you.
[35:57.35]Alright, so you saw what I was talking about, right?
[36:00.14]His left arm is part of his hitbox.
[36:03.44]So you have to, you can't
[36:07.59]Stupid-ass boss down like bird with a World of Warcraft fist weapon Let's do some poison put on the chef gear He has a lot of lightning still though
[36:44.55]Maybe I should just keep this stupid thing on.
[36:46.49]Alright.
[36:55.22]Maybe I should try slashing the arm.
[36:56.64]Maybe I'll try that.
[36:57.76]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[37:06.84]Well, let me know.
[37:07.40]I need to see who that was.
[37:08.90]I know I'm dying.
[37:09.56]I just, like, didn't even see who subbed.
[37:11.74]OddEnt.
[37:12.62]Five months.
[37:13.50]Damn, you guys with the five months.
[37:15.46]The guys that have been subbed for, like, four, five, six months now going on.
[37:22.41]That's, um... That's pretty... Like, thanks.
[37:26.49]I just, like, can't believe.
[37:28.33]Even when I wasn't even streaming.
[37:33.55]That's some dedication there.
[37:38.65]They all dead.
[37:39.07]Is this a quicker way to go, or is this a longer way?
[37:56.18]Uh, this looks like a longer way.
[38:10.15]Trying to find, like, the super easy route.
[38:12.45]Not the one that's gonna get me killed.
[38:15.39]And that one will get me killed, so I'm just gonna go this way.
[38:31.39]Whoops, that's not the right thing.
[38:37.80]Where the hell did that guy come from?
[38:51.76]Playing the YouTube simulator?
[38:53.38]Hold on a second.
[38:54.78]That person is freaking me out.
[38:56.12]It's like ghost people.
[38:58.27]Is this the lightning lady?
[39:00.57]Yeah, it is.
[39:00.93]Okay, you're dead.
[39:10.78]I feel like I should put on something for the boss, too.
[39:13.18]Do I have, like, a fire enchanted thing?
[39:14.82]Because I feel like lightning... You can't hurt lightning people if you have lightning.
[39:19.82]Isn't that, like, a strategy?
[39:20.76]It's like a Pokémon, right?
[39:22.94]I'm trying to shoot my Charizard into a Fire Oseo.
[39:31.25]So if they're in the light, you can see them.
[39:34.11]I hope I just hit all of them.
[39:35.87]I did not.
[39:36.27]I don't even care.
[39:40.05]Let's just go.
[39:42.34]I'm gonna put on, like, a fire enchant.
[39:56.35]Um... Attack speed, fire damage, poison damage... I'm gonna do fire.
[40:03.47]Do I have any, like, pine resin?
[40:07.79]Adds arcane damage to your attacks.
[40:15.18]This is like a fire bomb.
[40:16.58]We're going to use this too.
[40:17.90]We're going to do some strategy.
[40:19.20]I'm going to throw grenades at him and shit.
[40:24.77]Arcane.
[40:25.23]Do I have any?
[40:25.61]This is holy damage.
[40:29.75]Poisoning.
[40:31.89]Add fire damage to your attacks.
[40:33.43]We're going to try and just smoke this guy down as fast as we can.
[40:38.60]with fire.
[40:39.14]I hope it works.
[40:39.68]I hope he, like, is immune, not immune to fire.
[40:41.84]I hope he's immune to fire.
[40:45.47]But, we're about to find out.
[40:48.59]Alright, let's try this again.
[40:49.83]Huh!
[40:49.91]The third lamp.
[41:07.51]It's alright.
[41:13.86]Not bad.
[41:14.22]Whoa, what was that move?
[41:20.66]That was a different move.
[41:23.36]He's doing other things now.
[41:24.42]He's combining moves.
[41:35.65]Eat shit!
[41:43.27]That didn't even do anything.
[41:44.47]That's not even hurting him.
[41:47.71]That grenade didn't do any damage at all.
[41:50.27]He ate that whole thing.
[41:56.64]Oh my god, those really are not doing anything.
[42:00.00]I'm not gonna use another one of those fire things.
[42:05.26]Jesus.
[42:16.16]Jesus.
[42:19.68]Jesus.
[42:28.37]Ugh.
[42:30.21]Lightning's just going everywhere right now.
[42:35.29]Well, I got him down lower than before.
[42:41.19]This guy sucks.
[42:55.52]I think that sucks a lot.
[43:00.41]Is fire doing it?
[43:01.19]Attack speed.
[43:05.79]I'm gonna keep the fire charm on.
[43:14.92]But this time, I'm gonna try the other one.
[43:16.50]I'm gonna try the arcane fire.
[43:18.95]Arcane fire.
[43:21.52]Fire was doing alright.
[43:23.96]I can't say it was the greatest thing I've ever seen before.
[43:27.10]So I have four of these arcane.
[43:29.14]These are not doing anything.
[43:30.88]Nothing at all.
[43:33.48]Maybe I'm going to drop a couple of these stone people.
[43:35.80]Can I drop a stone dude here?
[43:38.10]Or does it have to be a big sanctuary?
[43:42.04]Let's evaluate what we're wearing as well.
[43:47.51]Would that be classified as strike or slash?
[43:51.11]I don't know.
[43:56.28]Man, it might just be worth being a total slug.
[44:00.86]Because that's good.
[44:01.54]Except for no poison.
[44:08.63]Poison's really not the problem, it's really the lightning.
[44:13.65]Because he starts spamming it eventually here.
[44:21.84]This thing is so good with its class 3.
[44:30.45]This is useless.
[44:32.23]The poison's not the problem.
[44:36.77]That's gonna make me overburdened.
[44:40.39]This will not.
[44:43.34]Alright, 22.
[44:43.98]31.
[44:44.54]That's gonna make me overburdened.
[44:50.64]22, 22.
[44:50.74]This is your class zero.
[44:54.38]This one's better.
[44:57.71]Jesus.
[44:59.35]This thing is so good.
[45:00.57]I kind of have to put this on.
[45:04.55]I have to.
[45:05.67]And then take everything else off.
[45:09.93]We'll go to class zero with everything.
[45:11.69]Because that thing is insane.
[45:18.19]This is another class zero.
[45:19.95]Rogues gloves.
[45:25.29]I can't.
[45:26.16]I can't.
[45:27.90]Come on.
[45:28.34]Get me down to 50.
[45:30.26]Okay, that's 48.
[45:31.30]49.
[45:31.32]49.
[45:35.12]Okay, I can put the Jester's helmet back on.
[45:47.22]I can do the mask.
[45:47.92]I know the mask is too heavy.
[45:52.35]I'm just gonna have to go with like a patched up hood.
[45:58.86]Okay.
[45:59.98]That should help.
[46:01.06]A lot.
[46:10.87]I have my arcane thing on, right?
[46:12.57]There it is.
[46:15.17]In fact, I'm going to... If I'm going to do it, I've got to do it right.
[46:18.50]So, unequip all this crap.
[46:20.58]Because it just takes up space.
[46:21.76]You know what I mean?
[46:27.62]Just the important things that I know I need to use.
[46:30.10]Oh my god.
[46:40.68]Fucking God.
[46:41.76]Just die.
[46:42.16]I don't even care.
[46:42.74]I'll just refresh.
[46:50.01]Too excited about Dark Souls 3 to play any games right now.
[46:54.51]Do a worldwide release.
[46:57.11]I don't know why they have to do this whole three-week thing.
[47:01.76]Seems almost totally unnecessary.
[47:10.32]It's just, hey, the game's releasing like three weeks early for some random people.
[47:15.20]Buy it in Japanese.
[47:16.22]Get it in English.
[47:17.28]It's not done yet, though.
[47:18.22]But, you know, we decided that we were going to publish it over in the States.
[47:23.98]Let us play.
[47:24.60]You know what I mean?
[47:25.10]Let us play.
[47:38.56]I would love to play Dark Souls 3 right now.
[47:41.97]Remember, we have to do... We have to do a worldwide release thing.
[47:46.92]Because we have to see how many people in a row buy the game at GameStop.
[47:52.58]That's stupid shit.
[48:02.74]Gee.
[48:05.20]That's not it.
[48:05.86]There's another one.
[48:07.13]Where is he?
[48:10.11]Oh, don't ruin my life.
[48:11.49]He's going to hit me when I go in the elevator, isn't he?
[48:17.02]Travel to Japan and buy it?
[48:18.20]You don't even need to.
[48:22.16]On the Xbox store, can't you just buy it and put it in English?
[48:25.94]Or something like that?
[48:28.06]Can you do it on PS4 as well?
[48:29.51]I want it on PC.
[48:34.27]Okay, I'm going to try it again.
[48:35.59]Attempt number three on...
[48:40.93]Stupid World of Warcraft character.
[48:46.24]This is arcane damage.
[48:47.24]This is an arcane damage test.
[49:16.21]Yeah, that's definitely better.
[49:17.23]I just need to shape up a little bit here.
[49:24.99]Oh, shit.
[49:34.76]Damn it.
[49:35.54]It's so hard to tell if he's gonna do the jump back and swing.
[49:52.90]Come on, little shock waves.
[50:03.14]Fuck.
[50:04.58]I'm dead.
[50:04.82]I'm dead.
[50:07.24]I'm dead.
[50:07.86]I'm not dead.
[50:14.33]Jesus.
[50:22.72]Listen to me, son.
[50:29.65]Muffin sticks.
[50:31.01]Muffin sticks.
[50:31.59]I have to listen to you.
[50:32.47]I have to destroy him.
[51:02.73]Ah!
[51:04.09]That combo sucks!
[51:06.06]And why does it have to wound me this much?
[51:17.38]God!
[51:18.04]Holy shit!
[51:25.75]Why does he have to have the stupid wound minus 50% max HP?
[51:32.04]Oh, fuck you.
[51:35.16]Where is that stupid ring?
[51:36.34]Give me this fucking thing.
[51:48.23]Stupid asshole boss. ...
[52:02.96]Locks minimum stamina to one third of stamina.
[52:05.42]Maybe I should put that on.
[52:15.88]Has effect on focus usage.
[52:19.48]I'll put the rolling speed one on too because I have a big heavy thing on.
[52:26.72]Amplifies elemental magic?
[52:27.98]No.
[52:29.71]Sugar only, that's right.
[52:31.35]Sugar only.
[52:32.63]Let's see, what can I say?
[52:35.03]What can I say to make myself... Try this one too.
[52:38.59]Okay, so this is... Reduce wounding.
[52:53.08]Dramatically reduces stamina fatigue from combat.
[52:56.60]Lightning defense.
[52:59.30]What's this last one that I have?
[53:00.88]Rolling speed.
[53:03.26]Okay.
[53:04.45]Here's the worst part about this.
[53:05.81]I need to buy more of these.
[53:07.43]Where can I get these?
[53:12.03]Is it even worth an attempt to go in with just one of these?
[53:16.06]I don't think so.
[53:26.74]Burn the fields and sugar the Earth.
[53:39.41]I don't know if it's worth an attempt to just do just this.
[53:42.58]With one.
[53:43.14]Because I went through two or three last time.
[53:54.12]Why am I not using the grenades?
[53:55.52]Because they do zero damage to this boss.
[54:01.76]Oh lord.
[54:10.36]Stained page.
[54:13.24]Alright, who's looking it up?
[54:14.48]Where do I buy stained pages?
[54:16.45]Or can I even?
[54:23.92]I don't really want to go up here and attempt it.
[54:25.56]Because that arcane damage was doing a lot.
[54:41.27]The wounding mechanic is really dumb.
[54:42.89]Yeah, I mean, I could see if it was something like what Dark Souls 2 did.
[54:46.83]When you die, you have to like... It can happen, you get less maximum stamina or something.
[54:54.09]But we're gonna do this.
[54:59.83]Attack bonus to say... Like, I haven't even used these.
[55:02.49]It's time to use them.
[55:09.06]Like, I want, like, to be able to kill this fucking guy.
[55:14.32]Prayer potency bonus.
[55:16.06]Grants gold drop.
[55:16.82]No, I just want to be able to do this guy.
[55:18.34]Because do you sell shit?
[55:19.24]What do you sell?
[55:19.74]Come on, you have to, like, sell some shit for me.
[55:31.50]I could upgrade my armor.
[55:34.71]I don't know what to upgrade though.
[55:35.87]There's too many choices.
[55:41.15]What about a shield?
[55:43.61]Yeah.
[55:46.69]Yeah, it might be time.
[55:48.13]As much as I'm going to do no damage, I might be able to do it.
[55:51.65]Let's just go with this.
[55:52.59]I'm going to try this.
[56:00.49]We need something quick.
[56:05.61]I could just put a shield on.
[56:06.63]I could do a one-hander with this, but it's not as good.
[56:12.04]I want to be quick.
[56:18.94]Great axe dagger.
[56:21.14]I could do the woodsman's axe.
[56:25.94]The mace is not terrible.
[56:33.54]I feel like this is just doing too much damage to even consider taking it off.
[56:43.78]What happens if I upgrade my jester equipment?
[56:48.15]Out of curiosity.
[56:48.99]I just want to see what it does.
[56:56.17]6.6.
[56:58.81]Actually, it's pretty good to do that.
[57:00.07]I kind of have to just pick a piece of gear that I want to use
[57:05.69]What about the madman's tunic?
[57:06.96]This thing.
[57:15.62]Upgrade my champagne.
[57:20.43]I gotta upgrade my champagne.
[57:28.25]Well, I think I am gonna upgrade this.
[57:31.47]I have plenty of resources.
[57:33.16]Just, I'm gonna do it.
[57:35.80]Let's go.
[57:36.86]This thing is fucking crazy anyways.
[57:41.14]And I'm gonna level up here once or twice and get some more endurance.
[57:47.41]33, 30.
[57:47.65]Yeah, let's fucking get... Let's level this thing up max.
[57:54.44]I want my bear chest to be unbeatable.
[58:05.63]Are we doing it again?
[58:06.29]Are we doing it again?
[58:07.59]I can't.
[58:14.01]I don't have 15 heart souls.
[58:18.92]Let me break open some packets.
[58:21.72]I have a bunch of them.
[58:22.44]I don't need to save them anymore.
[58:24.60]Just use the damn things.
[58:26.96]Nice box of salt.
[58:34.29]My pecs are basically chainmail.
[58:35.87]Yeah, I know.
[58:40.21]Sack of shit.
[58:47.60]Alright.
[58:48.92]Let's do this again.
[58:56.84]I want this thing as good as it can possibly be.
[59:00.90]Because if there's one thing I'm going to upgrade, it might as well be this.
[59:03.90]And that's all I can do.
[59:04.92]This thing's fucking crazy, you know?
[59:09.18]What else?
[59:09.46]What about my, like, jester horns?
[59:10.90]No, no.
[59:11.30]I'm going to save my stuff because I get a... You know, you never know when you're going to find a weapon in this game.
[59:16.94]I'm okay with that right now.
[59:19.74]But now... Where do I buy... Where do I buy... 99...
[59:34.15]Upgrade the Warhammer?
[59:35.09]It's already as much as I can get it.
[59:38.83]I don't have the required... A Lord's Orders.
[59:44.20]I don't have it.
[59:45.20]So I can't do it.
[59:49.14]Listen, son.
[60:00.10]Thanks a lot.
[60:00.60]Welcome.
[60:01.20]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[60:02.12]Thanks for subbing.
[60:05.19]What's your name?
[60:06.53]Little Mond?
[60:07.95]Little Almond.
[60:09.41]Little Mond.
[60:11.27]Little Almond.
[60:13.59]I'm gonna destroy him.
[60:14.59]I will.
[60:17.59]My father.
[60:18.69]My son.
[60:19.09]Alright, where the fuck do I buy this shit?
[60:26.29]I need like a Wikipedia page to tell me where to go.
[60:28.65]Hey, Wikipedia.
[60:31.19]Where do I buy stained pages?
[60:33.25]Siri.
[60:33.49]Siri.
[60:38.03]Oh, Siri's disabled on my phone.
[60:41.09]Whoops.
[60:41.61]Oh, shit.
[60:41.93]No, it's not.
[60:42.35]Who am I calling?
[60:42.79]Oh, fuck.
[60:43.09]What's going on?
[60:43.49]I'm calling somebody.
[60:45.95]No.
[60:46.57]What's going on?
[60:47.55]Stop calling.
[60:48.11]Stop calling.
[60:48.71]Stop calling.
[60:53.24]Who was I just trying to die?
[60:54.46]Was I trying to die at like a pizza place?
[60:57.56]Okay.
[60:58.72]That was weird.
[61:16.16]g call siri eat trash okay I gotta find this npc we're going on an adventure
[61:52.10]Ready for an adventure?
[61:52.84]Actually, this is not a good adventure to go on.
[62:08.43]Where's the sugar emote?
[62:09.55]That's a good question.
[62:13.35]But I need to see if it's possible for me to go backwards here.
[62:20.16]Because like I said, I don't want to even attempt this without another, at least one more page.
[62:31.31]Ranger... Ranger Latham?
[62:33.95]Ranger Latham.
[62:34.77]Latham.
[62:35.37]Latham.
[62:35.87]Latham.
[62:37.49]Thanks.
[62:37.83]Welcome.
[62:39.75]Destroy him.
[62:42.77]Don't worry.
[62:43.11]All you guys that have subbed so far are telling me to destroy him.
[62:46.69]I'm gonna use that power.
[62:47.85]You're giving me the power.
[62:50.29]I just need a few more stained pages.
[62:56.53]I'm gonna buy like 50 of them.
[63:01.15]From the asshole over here.
[63:02.29]I call people assholes a lot.
[63:08.04]It's not really nice.
[63:13.86]Whoa!
[63:14.14]I'm not gonna activate this.
[63:21.90]No, it's so far back.
[63:26.11]No, it's not even worth it.
[63:29.19]This guy that apparently I can buy these from is in the castle.
[63:34.53]Which is like back and up.
[63:36.96]We're going to do it the old-fashioned way.
[63:38.10]I'm just going to have to actually beat him.
[63:40.94]You know, without all these special things.
[63:46.20]Old-fashioned way.
[63:48.71]I don't feel like just walking, backtracking for the next 15 to 20 minutes to find the guy to buy this from.
[63:56.28]I'm not going to torture you guys with that.
[64:04.52]We're just going to try to win.
[64:06.64]I upgraded my armor.
[64:11.56]And I'm going to put a shield on because I can do this one-handed.
[64:16.79]Get this dumb charm off.
[64:18.91]Dumb, dumb.
[64:24.83]No, I want to keep the charm on.
[64:27.93]Where is it?
[64:28.21]Here it is.
[64:30.71]Fire, lightning.
[64:31.73]Because I could probably eat an entire lightning wave when he does it.
[64:34.99]74.
[64:38.01]That's the best one, huh?
[64:41.59]Wooden targe.
[64:45.44]Okay, now I just need to take off... I gotta take some clothes off.
[64:52.40]Fuck.
[64:55.53]Nope, it ain't gonna work.
[64:58.29]Back to bed.
[65:01.15]Back to bed.
[65:04.88]Yep.
[65:06.08]Back to bed, guys.
[65:07.30]Not gonna work.
[65:08.44]Just going for it again.
[65:09.93]I have the fire one, too.
[65:11.09]I can put that on.
[65:12.45]This is arcane.
[65:13.31]Okay.
[65:14.85]I just have to not get comboed.
[65:16.85]It's gonna be tough, but I just have to believe.
[65:20.42]I gotta believe in myself, you know?
[65:23.86]Believe you can do it.
[65:39.23]There's the other one.
[65:43.77]Like Parappa the Rapper said in 1999.
[65:45.11]Gotta believe.
[65:58.52]Right when I get up the stairs.
[66:00.78]Just get out of here.
[66:01.44]I don't even care about you.
[66:05.02]Stupid.
[66:06.61]Stupid.
[66:09.34]I don't even know why I was fighting them.
[66:11.86]I should have just ran right by him.
[66:15.04]The biggest, most important thing is I have to... What are you hitting?
[66:19.62]I don't see anything.
[66:20.56]Oh, those are the invisible enemies.
[66:22.64]You know, my most favorite.
[66:23.92]Let's see, what does this say?
[66:30.75]Monster is weak to pain.
[66:32.99]Holy damage can kill it.
[66:35.01]Beware, monster ahead.
[66:36.81]Use flame and slash.
[66:39.45]Thanks for the tips!
[66:40.09]I'm not even gonna activate this yet.
[66:45.67]I need as much time as I can just to hammer the hell out of him in his first phase.
[67:05.48]Shit.
[67:05.74]Am I supposed to dodge back on that one?
[67:14.03]Come on.
[67:14.77]Okay, he's down to like 50%.
[67:15.33]Wow.
[67:15.43]I actually got hit by that.
[68:34.22]You just have to do it.
[68:36.80]You just have to do it.
[68:43.12]Sometimes you just have to do it.
[68:49.06]Girly scream.
[68:50.02]No, that's my all the air comes out of my lungs when I think I'm about to die.
[68:58.51]That noise should be the sub sound.
[69:00.13]No.
[69:01.05]That'll scare the shit out of people.
[69:03.97]When I watch some of these VODs back, it scares me.
[69:09.44]Nothing else over here.
[69:14.80]Make sure I don't miss anything.
[69:20.27]No.
[69:22.45]Let's go onward and upward.
[69:29.35]think a human could make that noise.
[69:36.43]This air, it's so still.
[69:38.30]I was drawn to this dome for reasons I don't understand.
[69:40.98]It's so lonely here.
[69:43.06]I long for a friend, but I think I've driven everyone I've loved away.
[69:46.72]Tell me, have you heard of hard light?
[69:49.86]No.
[69:51.08]Well, let me tell you.
[69:52.75]Hard light has been described as not unlike crystallized moonbeams.
[69:56.89]Moon.
[69:58.15]We know very much about the moon.
[70:00.61]I can only be seen and touched by those that possess a hard light brand.
[70:03.25]He's going to give me a brand.
[70:04.17]Okay.
[70:07.89]Uh, yeah.
[70:08.19]Give me, sure.
[70:11.18]Give me the brand.
[70:14.44]Ah, so take a look at the left.
[70:15.32]Alright.
[70:15.66]Watch this.
[70:16.00]Remember I was asking about that like two streams ago.
[70:21.66]I was like, what are those little floating misty clouds?
[70:24.18]Well, now I can walk on them.
[70:25.16]Cool.
[70:28.57]And did you do anything else?
[70:30.25]Okay, I don't really care what you have to say.
[70:32.07]Oh!
[70:35.35]What?
[70:37.85]Huh?
[70:40.03]Huh?
[70:44.57]Huh?
[70:46.13]What?
[70:48.38]What?
[70:48.70]I can't, like, grab them?
[70:51.82]What the fuck was that?
[70:56.04]Are you going to tell me I can walk on these?
[70:57.73]And I can't.
[70:58.89]And then I pull out the thing to allow me to walk in, and I can't grab it?
[71:05.89]That's... Oh, my God.
[71:07.43]Like, give me a break.
[71:09.31]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[71:16.11]Holy mackerel.
[71:17.29]Holy mackerel the third.
[71:18.45]Thanks for something.
[71:21.39]Welcome.
[71:22.29]Welcome back.
[71:24.21]Hold on, I can't die here.
[71:25.43]I need to be very careful.
[71:27.71]I gotta go up and around.
[71:30.51]No, it's right here actually, isn't it?
[71:31.79]Isn't it right down here?
[71:35.46]No, I need to go up so I can figure out what the fuck that shit even does.
[71:38.76]Thanks for giving me the brand, it doesn't do anything.
[71:43.32]Yes, I've given you the ability to walk on the clouds.
[71:48.81]Except don't try to do it.
[71:50.51]Because I've been up here so long, I'm so alone, and I'm so tired.
[71:56.18]Everything I've said is untrue.
[72:05.24]Huh!
[72:06.94]And it works now.
[72:08.61]This is exactly what I was trying to do before.
[72:13.63]Unbelievable.
[72:17.32]Un-be-lievable.
[72:21.96]Unbelievable.
[72:26.42]Put this shit down.
[72:27.23]Oh, no!
[72:36.51]Just go fuck these things.
[72:46.86]He was right behind me.
[72:47.60]That's why I screamed.
[72:51.78]No, I used the torch.
[72:53.54]I used the torch and it made the sound.
[72:55.07]He just didn't grab the ledge.
[73:04.09]That happens again.
[73:07.38]I'm going to do absolutely nothing but just sit here and seethe.
[73:17.33]Un-beer-lievable.
[73:19.07]Un-beer-lievable.
[73:22.15]Don't do anything, I need to make another coffee.
[73:24.69]Not a coffee!
[73:26.19]Dro, how much coffee are you drinking?
[73:30.67]Okay.
[73:31.87]So.
[73:33.59]Let's do this again.
[73:39.68]I don't know why I couldn't grab it last time, grab the ledge.
[73:43.12]Watch out for the bug.
[73:48.46]Alright, that's as far as I go.
[73:51.24]So that's the end of this whole area, huh?
[73:54.90]Yeah, that's the end of the area.
[73:58.05]Was there a way for me to go the other way?
[73:59.59]I don't think so.
[74:02.11]I don't think there was.
[74:02.69]I think we're off to a different spot.
[74:06.27]God damn it!
[74:13.59]Kindly.
[74:15.19]Would you kindly.
[74:17.27]Would you kindly.
[74:21.74]I even swung because I knew they were here.
[74:23.94]But I didn't hit anybody.
[74:27.23]Would you kindly get over there and grab the ledge?
[74:30.55]Would you kindly?
[74:33.61]Yes, would you kindly?
[74:37.84]A man chooses a slave obeys.
[74:43.84]A man chooses...
[74:54.26]You drink way too much coffee.
[74:57.30]Get some decaf in there.
[75:03.55]There is the new potion.
[75:04.83]Yes!
[75:07.93]I want endurance.
[75:10.39]It's endurance time.
[75:14.76]Because I have things I want to wear.
[75:20.88]Could continue to go this way.
[75:22.10]And this is class 4 heavy armor.
[75:23.72]Where's class 3?
[75:24.18]Do I already have it?
[75:25.16]I don't even have class 2, do I?
[75:31.93]Class 4.
[75:34.43]Where's class 2?
[75:35.29]What is this?
[75:35.73]What's this pill?
[75:37.93]Energy potion.
[75:43.43]I could go down this way and get this other healing potion here.
[75:50.54]Decaf is disgusting.
[75:53.84]Don't spoil a 2007 game, please.
[76:01.67]Class 2 shields.
[76:02.89]I don't really care for shields.
[76:09.04]This is class 1 heavy armor.
[76:12.80]Wouldn't it just be here?
[76:14.80]Am I missing it?
[76:16.42]This is class 3 armor.
[76:20.25]Where's class two?
[76:21.91]Here it is.
[76:22.19]So I already have it.
[76:25.87]What the heck is happening here?
[76:28.71]I can get this.
[76:29.31]This is class three next.
[76:30.42]Okay.
[76:34.52]So if that's the case, what do I have in my inventory that is even class?
[76:38.56]This is class two.
[76:41.18]This is class three.
[76:42.50]Okay.
[76:48.50]We'll do that next.
[76:49.92]For now, I'm going to do a couple points of endurance.
[76:55.16]Just let me get a couple of points of endurance.
[76:59.10]I already have this here, so I might as well just go... Whoa!
[77:02.29]Whoa!
[77:02.55]SolidPat221.
[77:04.81]Thanks.
[77:05.33]Welcome to the family.
[77:19.43]Your support is extremely appreciated.
[77:26.03]Now where do I go?
[77:26.61]I mean, where do I go now?
[77:34.27]Listen to me, son.
[77:36.80]I'm your dad!
[77:44.50]Wasn't there another spot I got to?
[77:45.86]Remember when I climbed up the pyramid?
[77:50.29]I climbed all the way up the pyramid and then was like, oh, what the hell am I?
[77:54.70]I was inside of like the ziggurat.
[77:56.20]Isn't that where I need to be?
[77:58.24]I think it is.
[77:59.08]So I think it's back this way where the cages were.
[78:01.86]And it was down to the left.
[78:05.38]Well, I think.
[78:21.02]Wait a minute.
[78:21.32]Hold on.
[78:25.48]What?
[78:29.44]Aye.
[78:31.90]Is there like a secret way to do this?
[78:34.33]Was that like me falling?
[78:35.31]Hold on.
[78:35.87]Wait a second.
[78:36.61]I can see over there.
[78:37.37]I wasn't even paying attention.
[78:41.93]Was there one above that one?
[78:42.85]I wasn't looking.
[78:43.33]I was looking to chat.
[78:45.31]I don't know.
[78:47.30]Maybe there was.
[78:50.00]Or maybe you'd have to go from this way.
[78:53.62]This game is currently only on PS4.
[78:54.90]Currently.
[78:57.57]I'm not sure what their release schedule is.
[79:11.89]I think it was down here, right?
[79:23.83]I should probably get this.
[79:25.89]Considering I don't need to be back in the other area.
[79:27.67]I'll just get this one.
[79:34.23]Ooh!
[79:34.89]That's not a bad idea.
[79:37.23]Sorry, we have to go back.
[79:39.25]Somebody said try to do a double jump off the ledge.
[79:41.53]Is the ledge big enough?
[79:42.23]We're going to find out.
[79:42.87]That was a very good idea.
[79:47.97]You are a smart guy.
[79:51.37]DESTROY HIM!
[79:54.61]Whoa!
[79:57.07]Onion the... Okay, you're... I gotta... I gotta take a look at his name.
[80:01.27]Onion the... Ocup... Ocupolite.
[80:04.43]The Ocupilite.
[80:05.58]I don't even... I'm not sure.
[80:06.94]Thanks.
[80:07.20]I was gonna call you Onion, because it's easier for me.
[80:10.54]But, welcome, Onion.
[80:17.82]I don't think I can.
[80:21.22]Ooh, I kind of can.
[80:22.54]Kind of.
[80:22.86]There's got to be something up here that I can drop off of, right?
[80:31.50]No, damn it.
[80:32.22]I just don't want to grab the edge.
[80:44.43]I don't think I can do it, even after jumping off the edge.
[80:47.03]Because you have to go from the bottom...
[80:51.02]Yeah.
[80:51.84]I don't even know how I did it that first time.
[80:53.63]Like that.
[80:54.95]Nope.
[80:55.41]Not gonna work.
[80:59.73]I'm gonna give it one more good attempt.
[81:01.37]Maybe if I can get like in the middle here.
[81:02.63]That was actually closer.
[81:07.23]As long as... I just gotta get to that one spot before grabbing the edge.
[81:13.70]It's a pixel perfect jump.
[81:15.88]I'm gonna get it.
[81:16.62]And then you guys can put on the forums that look what this guy, Jerma985, did.
[81:22.58]No, it's not going to work.
[81:23.90]Last try.
[81:24.32]Alright, goodbye.
[81:27.56]There's something else I need to do there that I'm not smart enough to do.
[81:35.79]They call me the onion.
[81:36.71]I can't wait until somebody does that at like AGDQ and then we all do like pogchamps and like clapas and stuff.
[81:54.16]There's a super jump glitch.
[81:57.56]I'm not even going to try to do that one.
[81:59.75]Frog champ?
[82:02.79]That's a pretty good idea for an evote.
[82:04.21]Frog champ.
[82:06.70]It's just the pog champ, but it's a frog doing it.
[82:19.26]Alright, I need to find where the ziggurat was.
[82:25.04]I kind of don't remember.
[82:26.00]I think it was down here.
[82:26.74]Out of my way.
[82:38.13]Those two idiots are just touching each other.
[82:39.89]Just clipping into each other.
[82:46.25]Okay, was it down here?
[82:50.98]Or down here.
[82:54.80]I don't know.
[82:55.26]Time for an adventure in my least favorite place.
[82:58.04]This is where the smashers are, I think, right?
[83:04.01]This is where we get smashed.
[83:04.93]I wonder if I... Did I open something?
[83:11.64]You want to get food, but you don't want to leave the stream?
[83:13.52]I guarantee you that I will be streaming when you get back.
[83:16.30]That is a 100% guarantee.
[83:19.54]As long as it's not like an hour or two from right now.
[83:22.96]If it takes you more than like three hours to get food, I probably won't be here.
[83:37.91]Don't do that.
[83:45.07]I will kill all of you.
[83:46.07]There you go.
[83:47.03]All you idiots on the left.
[83:47.99]Ah, the French champagne.
[83:50.79]It's always been celebrated for its excellence.
[83:55.66]Boom America.
[83:58.18]Welcome back.
[83:59.60]Welcome back, Red Wizard.
[84:04.28]Red Wizard is about to die.
[84:08.08]Red Wizard needs food badly.
[84:13.56]Gonna ride it all the way down.
[84:14.46]But welcome, thanks.
[84:15.34]Welcome back.
[84:18.44]You continued $5.
[84:21.87]Makes me happy.
[84:23.57]Thank you.
[84:24.69]Thanks for the $5.
[84:25.11]Five bucks.
[84:27.51]It's a five spot.
[84:35.96]I feel like it was over here.
[84:40.03]It was after the boss, wasn't it?
[84:41.23]Because I got lost.
[84:43.41]That's what we're going to do today.
[84:44.41]We're going to get lost again.
[84:48.03]You guys know what that is.
[84:50.93]Some of you guys know in the chat what that is.
[85:01.22]I want more damage.
[85:04.04]I could buy a wonder book with those five dollars.
[85:08.30]Oh, you know, you could buy a Wonder Book for those $5 too, you know.
[85:12.85]We could both own the Wonder Book.
[85:20.67]I remember getting angry at this.
[85:22.77]Oh, look at the guy just doing it, idiot, and getting mad.
[85:26.20]And then this is where the tree guy was, and then I moved from the tree guy... over... and to the left.
[85:36.42]And that goes down even more, right?
[85:44.88]I fucking hate this game.
[86:06.53]I hate backtracking!
[86:10.31]More than anything!
[86:20.18]Remember that area that you already did?
[86:21.80]Wanna go do that area again, except just try to run as fast as you fucking can through the whole area?
[86:27.00]Because you don't care anymore because you already played this part of the game?
[86:30.47]Don't you want to go back through that again and do the whole thing again?
[86:35.95]No!
[86:37.91]I don't!
[86:41.71]I don't want to do that!
[86:49.29]No, I don't have the sugar only?
[86:51.29]No.
[86:55.52]Turn on the red lights.
[86:58.02]Listen to me, son.
[87:00.02]I'm your dad.
[87:02.56]Destroy him!
[87:10.17]Whoa!
[87:11.51]That just sounded like Paul Ibarra was trying to calm me down.
[87:15.47]Listen to me, son.
[87:16.71]I'm your dad.
[87:17.74]Like, you need to listen to me.
[87:20.59]Loveadub.
[87:21.85]Thanks for subbing.
[87:24.13]You know, Loveadub, thanks for telling me.
[87:26.59]Listen to me, son.
[87:29.73]And that sounds like I'd eat some decaffeinated coffee.
[87:43.18]No, I just don't like backtracking through what I consider to be the worst part of the whole game.
[87:46.96]This area.
[87:56.10]And I'm going to be upset about it.
[87:57.54]Because I have to ride a stupid elevator.
[88:03.40]And I might not even be going the right way.
[88:05.16]You know, that's possible too.
[88:19.33]Decaf is stupid and pointless.
[88:20.87]Decaf... I would drink... I drink decaf only...
[88:25.24]If... I just... I'm one of those people that needs something in his hands.
[88:28.50]Like, I just need to be, like, sipping on something or drinking or, you know... Doesn't matter what it is.
[88:34.46]I just need something.
[88:42.01]I'm just trying to remember, like, exactly where I need to be going.
[88:44.23]And this time, what's up, I don't just fall down... This stupid hole.
[88:47.51]Because this entire... This entire zone is a giant fucking hole.
[88:52.97]I'm glad I have to do this again.
[88:58.16]Give me these back.
[89:03.30]Oh my fucking god.
[89:15.21]Oh god!
[89:16.19]God, error!
[89:17.17]Game fucking crashed and I lost.
[89:18.81]Game over.
[89:20.69]Game over.
[89:21.13]An error.
[89:22.37]They're trying to tell me something.
[89:42.68]kidding me what is this report that problem suggested actions I just want to play I want to play salt and sanctuary what happens if I lost
[90:03.11]All my progress.
[90:04.45]I'm actually not even really coming to terms here.
[90:07.45]With what might have just happened.
[90:09.73]It's possible that something could have just gone horribly wrong.
[90:12.93]And I might have lost progress.
[90:14.73]Hope not.
[90:18.75]That's the reason why I felt like the game was unresponsive.
[90:22.31]I jumped up on that and the game was unresponsive and it crashed.
[90:25.07]And that's exactly what happened.
[90:26.81]At least that's what I tell myself.
[90:32.51]Uh, okay, well.
[90:34.69]That's one of my suggested actions.
[90:37.78]Up- Try to update the application.
[90:41.40]Update the system software.
[90:44.10]You know what?
[90:44.46]I'm fucking- We're going dark.
[90:46.98]Oh my god, my- I think my console turned off.
[90:52.77]What the fuck is going on?
[90:58.11]I- I made- I did like the we're going dark as a joke.
[91:06.17]Uh, is it back?
[91:11.85]Uh... Okay.
[91:16.19]Let's see where we ended up.
[91:19.97]What if my PS4 seriously just, like, red-ringed?
[91:23.90]I'd start laughing.
[91:31.80]Okay.
[91:32.30]Let's see where we ended up there.
[91:36.84]I think it was... I'm pretty sure we're okay.
[91:43.05]Yeah, we're fine.
[91:45.93]God damn.
[91:47.91]That was so weird.
[91:49.85]The entire time I've been playing this game, that hasn't happened.
[91:53.86]But apparently it does now.
[91:54.82]Alright.
[91:58.30]Alright.
[92:08.22]I'm just making sure the stream's working correctly.
[92:18.22]It looks to be working correctly.
[92:20.18]Alright, so... I don't know.
[92:32.95]I might just say fuck it and not even care.
[92:39.55]You know what I mean?
[92:40.70]Like, I just wanna go to the next area.
[92:46.66]Where's, like, the game tips and tricks and strategies, like, where to go?
[92:50.74]I'm done.
[92:52.08]I'm done with, like, the crash.
[92:53.32]The crash just crashed me.
[92:55.03]Internally.
[93:13.36]What's going on with my fucking... That's odd.
[93:17.75]Hold on a second, guys.
[93:19.97]Hold on a second.
[93:28.99]Hold on.
[93:29.43]Hold on.
[93:30.16]Alright, I'm ready to go.
[93:49.24]Let's, this time, let's have the game not crash.
[93:54.03]Let me try to find the ziggurat, because I know that's where I have to go.
[93:58.97]Turn on god mode, I wish.
[94:08.39]Go to the forums.
[94:09.65]I really, like, should, I'm gonna go to the forums and, like, just write a nine paragraph complaint.
[94:14.43]I'm using a hammer on my keyboard.
[94:32.86]I don't need to go this way.
[94:38.15]Zemarian?
[94:38.95]I'm not going to play Zemarian.
[94:43.09]I play Zemarian.
[94:48.55]Yeah, I did beat the parrot.
[94:51.04]Currently trying to do the wonderful thing of go find the next area of the game.
[95:01.12]You know, it's a blast.
[95:09.72]I will.
[95:16.06]Flex retro.
[95:17.22]Whoa, dude.
[95:19.72]Flex retro.
[95:20.24]Thanks for subbing.
[95:20.94]Welcome.
[95:25.45]Much appreciated.
[95:29.25]You've just joined the family.
[95:39.57]Get out of here.
[95:40.32]I'm going to go over here.
[95:42.02]I just want to take another look up here.
[95:43.96]Just in case I missed anything.
[95:46.08]Hey!
[95:47.34]Hold on!
[95:50.00]Was it over here the whole time?
[95:52.72]Was this where I needed to be?
[95:53.67]I think this might have been where I needed to be.
[95:57.83]Right?
[95:59.85]If I'm going to take a guess, I just learned this, so... This is probably the place I need to go.
[96:08.66]Kind of.
[96:09.36]Maybe.
[96:11.72]Cran's Pass.
[96:14.63]Wait, haven't I... Yeah, I remember this part.
[96:18.25]Isn't this where the poison people are?
[96:20.01]What do you have?
[96:26.51]You got salt?
[96:28.55]Pistol, pitchfire.
[96:29.69]Okay, we're gonna buy a shitload of these.
[96:34.58]Listen to me, son!
[96:38.24]By more.
[96:39.48]Destroy him!
[96:42.90]Whoa!
[96:45.18]Señor Azul.
[96:47.76]Señor Azul.
[96:50.50]Thank you.
[96:52.25]Welcome.
[96:57.87]You are appreciated.
[97:03.15]Yeah.
[97:03.71]Here we are.
[97:04.91]Because I can burn this now.
[97:07.32]Let's do this.
[97:11.08]Hey.
[97:11.24]Get out of the way.
[97:15.48]Oh, now I have to put the torch up.
[97:17.64]So I can jump off this.
[97:21.94]Yay, I found the new area.
[97:23.14]I don't even care about my lost souls.
[97:26.46]There's a boss right here.
[97:28.20]What?
[97:31.36]Is this for real?
[97:33.98]Okay.
[97:36.10]Mr. Crayon.
[97:38.55]I will kill you, I guess.
[97:41.37]Or try.
[97:41.79]This looks like Jack Skellington.
[97:45.89]It's like double flip, dude.
[97:49.93]Holy shit, this guy's kind of crazy.
[97:54.21]What is he doing?
[97:58.03]Jaffa McWaffleson.
[98:00.15]Welcome.
[98:00.71]Thanks for something.
[98:12.28]Jeez.
[98:14.63]Oh no, he's gonna do the ultra move!
[98:16.13]I can't... Get on the wall!
[98:18.27]Block it!
[98:21.11]That was very anticlimactic.
[98:22.37]What was that for?
[98:31.62]You wanna play fire with fire?
[98:32.72]I just got these.
[98:34.74]I just picked these up.
[98:36.86]What?
[98:37.90]Uh...
[98:45.58]Fuck!
[98:46.28]He can hit you with that shit.
[98:48.28]If you dodge through it, even.
[98:49.34]This guy's not too horrible, at least not now.
[98:54.86]Maybe eventually he will be.
[98:55.99]I say that so soon.
[99:16.07]Wow!
[99:16.47]Don't get sucked in!
[99:17.17]Actually, I'm getting afraid of that for really no reason, I don't think.
[99:22.12]Yeah.
[99:24.66]Alright, I can beat him.
[99:26.56]He doesn't do anything when you do that.
[99:28.22]I can just keep hitting him.
[99:33.19]Alright, that guy's not a problem.
[99:36.61]For some reason, any time somebody does that in a video game, they explode.
[99:41.04]You know, like the, here we go, I'm charging up, don't you see all the energy going?
[99:47.04]Boom!
[99:48.34]No.
[99:49.10]He just does that and doesn't fucking do anything.
[99:51.50]So, I don't even need to be scared of it.
[99:53.26]Oh, now this guy's dead.
[99:55.94]Because I'm not going to be terrified of him anymore.
[100:05.50]And I can just buy the fire thing from this lady.
[100:07.78]Maybe I shouldn't even be doing that.
[100:09.58]I'm not sure how much more damage it's doing.
[100:16.14]If I have it, I might as well use it, right?
[100:31.59]Mm-hmm.
[100:40.21]I need more heals.
[100:42.19]Here we go, see?
[100:42.71]I don't even need... I should have not been scared.
[100:48.47]That was a mistake to be scared of him.
[100:59.38]Come on, do it again.
[101:00.88]I'm gonna kill him right here.
[101:04.36]Like, that was... Don't ever be scared!
[101:06.44]Don't be afraid of Mr. Cran!
[101:14.70]Is that it?
[101:17.68]Ronin crayons ashes.
[101:18.90]What the hell do those do?
[101:23.24]I have ashes.
[101:23.84]I have somebody's tongue too, don't I?
[101:29.95]What the hell is that?
[101:37.31]I don't know.
[101:37.67]I'll have to look another time.
[101:38.55]Okay, he's dead.
[101:42.33]Maybe that's praised.
[101:45.60]Okay.
[101:48.39]There's a chest up here.
[101:51.75]And... Twisted Heart.
[101:54.63]Looks like Thorium.
[101:59.87]Not a charm.
[102:07.16]Oh, I got another ring, didn't I?
[102:08.68]Increases magic.
[102:15.05]Twisted Heart.
[102:19.23]Get the Rune Temple.
[102:23.42]We're just gonna go?
[102:24.88]Oh shit, there's a guy over there.
[102:27.22]Hold on.
[102:29.44]Uh, I'm gonna go back.
[102:32.08]This is a new place, so... Although there is a guy right here that I might be able to talk to.
[102:36.42]No?
[102:38.84]No, I can't.
[102:43.26]Couple of dummies.
[102:49.21]Lord's orders that's the thing to upgrade again so I can upgrade my weapon You love executive assault that game actually was pretty fun For what it was it was it was very interesting Because I want to upgrade my weapon
[103:19.72]And level up once or twice.
[103:23.18]Wait a minute.
[103:24.75]Nope.
[103:29.39]Am I going to stream more Overwatch?
[103:31.13]Probably not today.
[103:33.17]This is my salt and... I want to beat this game.
[103:35.29]I feel like I'm getting fairly close.
[103:39.38]I'm absolutely more than halfway.
[103:50.63]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[103:52.95]I'm going to sell some stuff that I'm never going to use.
[103:59.36]I can't see myself ever using any of the staffs.
[104:03.52]Staves.
[104:04.50]Just get rid of them.
[104:07.86]Strength dexterity.
[104:08.86]This is the reaper.
[104:10.04]No, I'm not going to be using this.
[104:14.33]Dagger.
[104:14.75]No.
[104:15.71]No.
[104:19.26]This is just like a crappy kind of scimitar.
[104:24.67]Pistol.
[104:26.55]Might be interesting, but no.
[104:31.07]This thing is cool.
[104:31.89]Strength scaling S. I wonder what happens.
[104:36.39]What would that be at max?
[104:42.32]Pitchfork.
[104:42.82]I don't need this anymore.
[104:46.72]Cane.
[104:52.66]staff.
[105:00.68]Lots of this shit too.
[105:04.68]Actually, I can see what the hell this stuff does now.
[105:07.28]I got a bunch of these dumb ears.
[105:09.18]Can be used as a transmutation material or exchanged with a leader.
[105:12.32]I have a lot of these there.
[105:17.01]Here we go.
[105:17.27]Bronze night ashes.
[105:18.91]Transmutation material exchanged with a leader.
[105:23.71]So this is like a crafting mechanic.
[105:25.61]Something with a blacksmith, maybe?
[105:30.83]I have a lot of this stuff.
[105:33.45]I haven't even attempted to use it.
[105:38.01]But since I'm here, I'm gonna buy at least like another five of these.
[105:43.00]No, we're gonna go fucking ten of them.
[105:45.84]Because you never know when I'm gonna need to use fire on somebody again.
[105:55.60]I do need a blacksmith.
[105:59.92]Level up.
[106:09.91]I was going up this way.
[106:14.46]I don't think I'm going to upgrade that hammer yet.
[106:21.96]Because I don't know how much better a weapon I might get later is.
[106:27.10]Endgame kind of stuff.
[106:28.94]So we're going to hold on to it.
[106:31.00]I don't need to do it at the moment anyway, so.
[106:37.00]Let's do another point.
[106:38.60]No, don't already have one.
[106:39.36]Yeah, I do.
[106:43.46]Yeah, max equipment load.
[106:45.97]Yes, purchase skill.
[106:51.39]Now, that should allow me to put something better on.
[106:58.09]No, not quite.
[107:03.94]59 out of 54. 51...
[107:20.76]That's not terrible.
[107:25.55]Put these on.
[107:26.83]I'm still not... I'm just barely at equipment load for that, though.
[107:32.03]I'll just leave it at that.
[107:34.21]Yeah, that's fine.
[107:34.77]Alright, where am I going?
[107:50.37]Back that way.
[107:54.84]Was there anything else over here?
[107:55.64]Like any hidden stuff that I didn't get?
[108:00.80]For all intents and purposes.
[108:05.50]There's the ruined temple.
[108:07.14]Like, yeah, let's do it.
[108:10.16]I was scared to just go because I had too many souls.
[108:43.15]Alright.
[108:45.95]Time to continue.
[108:53.39]One hit wonders.
[108:54.13]That's great.
[108:54.65]I love one hit wonders.
[109:03.17]Can I grab that?
[109:06.19]What the fuck is that?
[109:07.17]Okay.
[109:13.96]Well, that was interesting.
[109:16.68]That was some Indiana Jones shit right there.
[109:19.52]A King's Orders.
[109:34.07]What are the King's Orders?
[109:35.19]I'll have to look in a second.
[109:41.79]But first let me open up all these things.
[109:45.22]Three soldiers, poems, that's good.
[109:50.20]Continue exploring.
[109:55.86]Any more Indiana Jones shit gonna happen?
[109:58.72]Okay.
[110:00.31]Alrighty.
[110:04.23]Nice to meet you.
[110:06.51]Not gonna go this way yet.
[110:10.97]The king orders you to destroy him.
[110:14.24]At SummerSlam!
[110:16.88]Oh, yes!
[110:19.38]This looks like it leads to the area I was in before.
[110:22.64]This looks like I can talk to these people.
[110:33.63]Why can't I not?
[110:34.13]I can't... Hangman's poop?
[110:36.69]Oh, Hangman's rope.
[110:41.17]I really thought that's what it said for a second.
[110:50.64]Okay.
[110:53.90]This is going back to Cage Hall.
[110:58.16]I don't think I need to go here.
[111:04.73]What was that ring?
[111:05.43]Increases your defense to holy damage.
[111:12.71]Let me reevaluate my rings for a second here.
[111:15.61]Wounding.
[111:17.68]Lightning damage.
[111:18.44]I can take that one off.
[111:21.43]Not really concerned about that right now.
[111:27.83]Hmm.
[111:28.19]Unlocks minimum stamina to one third of stamina.
[111:34.57]I don't know, I... Does that not seem terrible?
[111:38.75]No, I mean, what?
[111:46.82]That's endurance, right?
[111:47.84]No, what is that increasing?
[111:50.24]The little white bar?
[111:54.55]I don't know.
[111:55.61]I'm not sure.
[112:01.17]What is the one that you just, like, swing?
[112:04.37]Defense to Arcane.
[112:05.49]Dexterity.
[112:10.72]I don't know.
[112:11.88]I could just keep the fucking thing on.
[112:16.46]I missed a key?
[112:20.62]Do the salt one, too.
[112:31.15]A key from the boss?
[112:36.94]Did he drop the key or did I just not grab it from something?
[112:56.51]Missed a boss.
[112:58.61]I missed a boss?
[113:01.57]I missed a key and a boss?
[113:05.33]That's quite a few things to miss.
[113:22.36]Lightning pod.
[113:23.26]It's a spell.
[113:34.67]Come on.
[113:35.57]Throw an arm at me.
[113:37.93]He grabbed me.
[113:42.41]Oh, these dumb guys that come out of the shadows.
[113:44.14]He hit me directly with an arm.
[113:47.16]I got hit right in the face with an arm.
[113:55.06]Damn.
[113:57.93]Ooh, new gear.
[114:09.89]Shit, he grabbed me again.
[114:10.71]I thought he was going to swing his arm at me.
[114:22.19]What?
[114:23.08]What?
[114:23.92]What?
[114:32.56]You have good aim.
[114:35.66]You should be a pro gamer.
[114:45.73]I can see you now.
[114:47.67]You can do the dumb thing where you hide.
[114:50.21]But I'll... Where is it?
[114:52.05]Right here?
[114:53.11]It's right there.
[114:58.10]What were you hiding?
[114:59.00]Oh, majestic ball of kitty litter.
[115:11.90]There's definitely a secret window over here, right?
[115:21.02]I tried to dodge through them, but it didn't work.
[115:33.18]Secret door?
[115:35.04]No.
[115:37.80]That's interesting.
[115:40.32]No secret door over there.
[115:42.92]What purpose does this serve, then?
[115:46.61]I don't know.
[115:52.96]Did I retire the frying pan?
[115:54.81]Oh, a long time ago.
[115:59.53]Frying pan wasn't working out.
[116:00.61]I don't like this at all.
[116:10.98]Tiny little hallway.
[116:16.62]Ziggurat!
[116:17.96]Isn't this where I'm supposed to be?
[116:21.42]I'm supposed to be here.
[116:23.26]I think this is the place I was looking for before.
[116:27.38]I found it.
[116:27.88]It's very long.
[116:48.71]Is this where I jumped over the pyramid?
[117:00.13]Friendly friend.
[117:03.96]This dude's friendly?
[117:05.56]No way.
[117:09.26]Yeah, friend.
[117:10.60]The bloodless prince.
[117:11.82]It's a giant stone person.
[117:13.82]Alright, we're gonna stay right underneath his loincloth.
[117:22.35]No, we're not.
[117:28.08]He does like a giant belly flop?
[117:30.22]Where are you supposed to go for that?
[117:41.35]I guess you can just kind of... I'm just gonna keep it, just take it slow.
[117:46.07]That actually hit me.
[117:47.83]He punched like 10 feet in front of me, or behind me, and I got hit by it.
[117:57.15]Jesus.
[118:01.40]I'm not really hurting him very much.
[118:15.52]Damn it.
[118:17.22]I actually might take off the hammer for this.
[118:28.68]Because I need to be able to move.
[118:30.20]This dude is huge.
[118:31.10]I think I know what I want to do here.
[118:40.79]Just wait for him to do that.
[118:42.59]And go over him.
[118:44.91]Just don't stand that close to him.
[118:46.97]Just let him do his belly flop.
[118:48.83]And hit him.
[118:52.27]And get away from him.
[118:55.05]Rinse and repeat.
[118:58.87]Yeah, I'm definitely absolutely 100% taking off the hammer and all these, because I'm just moving way too slow to be able to avoid any of the things he's doing.
[119:07.33]I think if I could be much faster than this, this would be way easier.
[119:20.30]I'm barely hurting him.
[119:29.83]So slow Thankfully the thing is right here I might as well just kind of die so I can get situated I feel like he doesn't take very much fire damage considering he's this big scary guy
[120:04.39]You have a lot of HP.
[120:08.25]Really?
[120:13.77]Nah, I'm not... This is a mute.
[120:17.44]This is a moot attempt.
[120:19.66]In fact, just kill me.
[120:22.86]So I can redo it.
[120:32.67]Hey, how are you?
[120:43.12]We're just going to try.
[120:44.12]I know I'm not supposed to be taking this gear off, but I want to be able to move.
[120:57.82]That's better.
[121:01.20]Could probably be even better.
[121:04.46]Let's do another thing.
[121:05.52]Light.
[121:06.46]I want to be able to really move.
[121:08.51]Okay.
[121:14.47]Fire charm.
[121:15.13]We'll try lightning charm.
[121:17.41]And... I guess I could put the fire damage thing on.
[121:22.68]Might as well.
[121:24.24]Let's try it again.
[121:26.48]Thankfully, we can just be right here.
[121:27.74]Let me get this off my bar.
[121:36.27]Let's try big man again.
[121:47.35]Hey, big guy.
[121:49.85]How are you?
[121:50.13]I don't want to be right next to him.
[122:04.52]This first part is okay because he doesn't do much.
[122:13.20]Looking for a belly flop.
[122:18.57]I got caught up there.
[122:20.57]Belly flop.
[122:21.01]Do it.
[122:22.37]Go for it.
[122:41.62]Fuck.
[122:43.36]It's okay.
[122:44.06]Everything's fine.
[122:53.33]Jump at me.
[122:58.11]He's probably going to do something else now.
[123:00.01]Because this is like getting to phase two-ish.
[123:08.52]I wouldn't be surprised if he started breathing fire at me.
[123:18.24]Come on, I dodged through it!
[123:34.31]Slow, slow, slow.
[123:35.63]Just have to have patience.
[123:38.88]I'm gonna get hit.
[123:39.60]No, no.
[123:43.36]Have patience, have patience.
[123:49.94]Oh fuck.
[123:50.88]He's like changed.
[123:51.50]He did something else.
[123:52.08]He was like... I guess not.
[124:01.48]What's he doing?
[124:04.64]He kind of froze up there for a second.
[124:17.10]Really?
[124:18.44]You're going to do that to me again?
[124:20.78]I have the worst time.
[124:25.96]Playing it safe.
[124:40.27]Once you figure this out, this is kind of not that big of a deal.
[124:46.33]Playing it safe.
[124:47.73]Not doing that.
[124:48.49]Not going in for the kill.
[124:49.79]I'm going in for the kill now, though.
[124:50.91]There we go.
[124:54.31]He's dead.
[124:58.53]That's a lot of souls.
[125:01.73]Vanquished!
[125:07.94]Okay.
[125:11.34]Where do we go now?
[125:12.14]I feel like I'm getting a bunch of bosses in a row.
[125:16.80]That was just two bosses in a row without much in between.
[125:20.65]Or did I come into the ziggurat backwards?
[125:25.91]I don't know.
[125:27.13]But I still need to play it safe.
[125:30.09]This looks like something I can pull.
[125:36.38]I don't know where we're going, but we're going here.
[125:42.92]Apparently.
[125:43.44]I don't know.
[125:47.61]Go back to the sanctuary.
[125:48.39]That sanctuary, you can't level up at it.
[125:51.19]The far beach.
[125:53.13]Okay, a lot of people died down there.
[125:59.67]There we are.
[126:13.70]Tree of skill.
[126:17.52]We can put our fat armor back on.
[126:20.42]Class three heavy armor.
[126:21.82]Yep, I will take it.
[126:30.41]Let me just take a look at what the class three armor is.
[126:33.03]What is class two?
[126:36.71]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[126:44.66]Agent Texas with the resub.
[126:48.10]He's an agent of Texas.
[126:50.99]He's a secret agent.
[126:55.11]No, I definitely like the sweaty fucking bloody shit.
[126:57.61]Yeah, that's coming back on.
[126:58.73]That's just unbelievably good.
[127:01.01]But these are also good.
[127:10.52]This is class 3.
[127:11.12]Yeah, these are going on for sure.
[127:15.75]Class 3?
[127:17.17]Class 3.
[127:17.49]That puts me up over though.
[127:19.09]I can't put these on until I get some more endurance.
[127:24.79]I will stay with these.
[127:26.19]These boots can just stay on.
[127:30.82]What doesn't put me over the edge?
[127:33.06]This doesn't.
[127:35.44]And that's what's going to stay on.
[127:36.30]Alrighty.
[127:41.19]Alrighty.
[127:43.26]These sub emotes are terrifying.
[127:44.68]Yeah, they kind of are.
[127:50.62]Alright.
[127:53.02]Now.
[127:56.90]If I go back here, because I did want to be in the ziggurat, didn't I?
[128:00.86]Go back down the slide.
[128:07.26]That's death.
[128:07.77]I'm not going that way.
[128:08.89]There's a ladder, but I don't think I really want to go down here.
[128:15.48]Let's just take a look.
[128:22.86]Out of my curiosity.
[128:26.62]Nothing?
[128:30.10]Nope.
[128:30.82]I think this just leads back to the... Yeah, over here.
[128:33.70]I can't even go this way.
[128:34.74]We're not going to go that way.
[128:35.43]We're going to go back.
[128:39.15]Yeah, I was actually working on an emote.
[128:41.63]A new one.
[128:45.46]But I can't get it right.
[128:47.40]It's so close.
[128:48.72]I just can't get it right.
[128:50.24]Actually, there's three emotes that are coming in probably in the next day or two.
[128:55.04]But they need to be... They have to be perfect.
[129:05.23]You can slide... Yeah, I know you can slide down.
[129:06.77]I just... I saw a lot of people died there, so I didn't really want to... You know, go down as fast as I could.
[129:14.17]I don't know what the hell was going to be happening.
[129:24.52]So... These little dudes are the... Alright, you're dead.
[129:29.27]These remind me of the fetishes from Diablo.
[129:38.80]Nothing over here.
[129:44.02]Jerm anus.
[129:47.60]Check out my new emote.
[129:49.66]Jerm anus.
[129:54.12]Nothing over there.
[130:00.09]Yeah, you'll get jermaSaturn.
[130:01.57]Don't worry.
[130:06.17]Jerma Anus.
[130:11.37]I don't know why I like that so much.
[130:17.72]We're in the Ziggurat.
[130:18.58]I just don't know where the hell I'm going.
[130:28.72]Plenty of items down here, though.
[130:29.96]Stone mage.
[130:35.14]I know I'm supposed to be here.
[130:39.05]But am I in the right version of here?
[130:43.33]I don't know.
[130:46.91]Burning sky ring.
[130:50.82]That's a mage ring.
[130:51.82]I don't need that shit.
[131:01.35]Is anything else up here?
[131:04.85]I don't think I can... I can't jump up to the stairs.
[131:16.48]My back's actually feeling better.
[131:19.32]Something really odd was going on for a while there.
[131:21.82]I have no idea what.
[131:44.82]again I'm back down here what was the point of this guy being here I must just be backwards hold on I know I have the ziggurat was the next place to go even before I came down here so is there a way I can get back up and around or something
[132:08.52]Stop playing Stardew and my posture came back.
[132:10.66]You know what?
[132:10.96]That actually did kind of happen.
[132:13.50]But it was something weird.
[132:15.75]It was not a typical my back hurts.
[132:26.51]I don't know.
[132:36.17]Just trying to see if I missed anything back here.
[132:41.39]Ruined temple again.
[132:46.98]Son of a bitch.
[132:53.75]This place is pretty empty.
[133:01.83]Stupid Indiana Jones ball.
[133:16.23]Oh, throw it again.
[133:20.69]Kidney stones?
[133:21.43]That would suck so bad if I had kidney stones.
[133:23.97]I've heard that is like... I've heard that's the equivalent of a male giving birth.
[133:30.16]If you pass kidney stones, you're essentially having a baby.
[133:33.78]From what I can determine from what people have said.
[133:48.53]Need a hand?
[133:51.69]Not sure.
[133:52.13]Not sure what I need right now.
[133:55.09]I'm definitely lost.
[134:10.51]False.
[134:13.55]I've heard terrible, terrible things.
[134:17.88]Stuff that I will not repeat in this courtroom.
[134:19.60]I don't think I went this way.
[134:26.65]Ooh, wait a minute.
[134:38.25]Huh.
[134:43.18]Lots of little odd places to jump and shit here.
[134:48.31]that I can't, like, do anything about.
[134:49.63]Go back around?
[134:58.91]What the hell was that?
[135:07.36]I can go this way.
[135:16.36]Maybe I missed a way to go down here.
[135:22.46]Forest fang?
[135:23.26]Looks like a dagger.
[135:32.46]I don't think so.
[135:36.50]I'm afraid I'm going to fall down all the way.
[135:40.14]I might have to... I might have to go all the way.
[135:43.78]Just go back to the sanctuary.
[135:46.17]I'm not sure what to do here.
[135:47.31]I have no idea.
[136:07.73]I don't know.
[136:14.88]That was such a grab.
[136:17.54]You guys want to see a grab?
[136:18.71]That was one right there.
[136:19.75]All the way over here.
[136:30.44]Nothing, nothing.
[136:33.20]What is that?
[136:34.84]I'm going to go back to the breach.
[136:38.16]Try giving up.
[136:42.20]There was a door.
[136:42.78]I'm trying to just figure out how to get back to the pyramid.
[136:46.52]I know it was part of the far breach.
[136:56.72]Was it back this way?
[136:59.78]Honestly, no.
[137:00.55]This is where I beat the last boss.
[137:04.23]What the fuck?
[137:08.17]I'm lost.
[137:10.83]I am lost.
[137:29.91]What the hell does that say?
[137:33.41]Because I think back this way is... No, I'm just going to check just for fun.
[137:38.78]Google it.
[137:45.21]Actually, I was at the breach back this way.
[137:49.17]When I saw... I came up through the fucking... I always have such trouble in games like these with a fucking two dozen areas that are scattered everywhere and you have to backtrack through all of them more than two or three times.
[138:05.12]Where's my GPS?
[138:08.70]Because I'm pretty sure up here I came out the bottom of the ground where the sanctuary was, right?
[138:15.76]Where's my arrow that like floats in the lower right?
[138:28.98]Where's my fucking... This is where you go arrow.
[138:32.66]Is that like DLC?
[138:33.76]Can I get that?
[138:48.07]Go find Navi.
[138:48.79]Yeah, because wasn't there a spot?
[138:53.27]I'm not sure if it was this way or not.
[138:57.57]But there was a spot where I came out of the ground.
[139:01.27]And I was in the breach.
[139:02.95]And I think that's where I needed to be.
[139:03.99]This might not even be the right way.
[139:06.73]Alright.
[139:11.44]I didn't even... That guy just went into the wall and did that.
[139:14.32]And I didn't even get the thing to go on me.
[139:16.08]Now, there it is.
[139:22.18]I'm gonna pass a kidney stone to go through.
[139:24.09]Because where does this take me?
[139:32.97]This is like the cage, the Hall of Cages, right?
[139:41.02]Backtracking is just a cheap way to make a game last longer.
[139:44.08]I agree with you.
[139:46.34]I hate it more than anything.
[140:03.82]It was up this way.
[140:04.50]Okay, because didn't I come over here?
[140:13.01]I remember going across this and being like, oh, I went across this thing.
[140:18.32]Wow, look at that.
[140:19.22]Okay, but I only have three of these things.
[140:32.80]I feel like using one of these now is just a pain in the ass.
[140:35.38]I can use it, I guess.
[140:39.46]But is it really worth it if I'm so close to where I'm supposed to be going?
[140:44.29]Fuck it, I don't even care.
[140:51.73]Huh?
[140:56.44]Where's... What am I looking at here?
[141:02.75]What the fuck is that?
[141:08.79]Isn't there... I don't have any travel points?
[141:15.60]Are you serious?
[141:16.56]What?
[141:20.28]I don't have any?
[141:21.30]I don't have any... Where are my guides?
[141:30.64]What's it done?
[141:35.35]I can't go anywhere, apparently.
[141:42.01]Okay.
[141:43.11]Well.
[141:43.39]Looks like we're just gonna go this way.
[141:46.17]I'm gonna go see the giant again.
[141:52.80]It's time to give up.
[142:00.25]I'm in the ziggurat right now.
[142:02.81]Can't give up.
[142:04.65]But I do want her healed.
[142:11.34]Where's my fucking guide?
[142:16.68]Try to make the game crash again.
[142:17.94]Now, the thing... I love these types of games.
[142:27.22]But it really, really sucks not knowing what, like, anything is supposed to do.
[142:32.04]And you're supposed to just know how to do it.
[142:35.93]These types of games, I always have a wiki page.
[142:39.29]What does this item do?
[142:41.41]Oh, okay.
[142:41.77]That's what that does.
[142:43.83]You got it.
[142:47.34]I've used a stone statue.
[142:56.99]I used the blacksmithing one.
[143:06.20]I just want to go up again.
[143:14.59]There was a way.
[143:16.83]I got there before and I'm going to go, where am I?
[143:22.21]I don't know if it was this way or not.
[143:24.19]But remember, we're just going to get lost.
[143:26.64]Because up and around here was...
[143:36.99]Okay, here we go.
[143:38.13]Here we go.
[143:38.57]Fire breach.
[143:44.12]Alright, where's my guide?
[143:45.74]Make offering.
[143:47.10]Give me a guide.
[143:47.70]Yeah, put a guide down.
[143:58.23]See, like, alright, for instance, right?
[144:00.09]Well, let's just go over this very briefly.
[144:03.53]So...
[144:05.24]It doesn't tell me on this that I can teleport to this.
[144:09.14]All it says is, hey, it gives you an item find bonus.
[144:12.66]Cool, huh?
[144:19.28]Just fucking put them all, I don't care.
[144:27.87]And then like, oh, wait, but if you look at this, you have a horn too, and you can go to that, use that horn...
[144:40.05]Yeah, I'd like to travel.
[144:45.99]Okay, where do I want to go?
[144:50.25]Hager's Cavern, The Watching Woods, Bandit's Pass.
[144:55.10]See, like, now that I know this exists, I'm going to use it all the time.
[144:57.82]But I didn't even really realize this existed.
[145:05.54]So, this is where I want to be.
[145:08.32]What do you even have?
[145:13.79]Yeah, just get fucking... I'll take a fucking hundred of them.
[145:22.89]Yeah, it says on the calling cord you need guides.
[145:24.57]I know, but like when... Let me just put it this way, right?
[145:29.61]When there's so much shit to have to keep track of, you lose track of certain things.
[145:36.39]I don't need any of these.
[145:37.11]I already have that ring.
[145:51.61]I'll buy a bunch of these from you, though.
[146:04.14]Alright.
[146:16.28]The game can be finished in 22 minutes?
[146:19.92]Yeah, you could say that about any game, though.
[146:23.68]You can finish Dark Souls 2 in like an hour, can't you?
[146:26.18]Or less than that?
[146:31.70]Endurance.
[146:40.13]Okay.
[146:41.65]So, I want to be here.
[146:56.95]Now, where was Ziggurat?
[147:04.07]Isn't it up here?
[147:04.61]Yeah, because this was the... It's this way.
[147:11.40]Dark Souls 2 can be beaten in 16 minutes on the original patch?
[147:14.12]Holy shit.
[147:21.79]Jerma knows what his nose knows.
[147:24.29]Yeah, I do.
[147:32.88]Oh, dear!
[147:34.82]Okay.
[147:36.68]I didn't have my torch out.
[147:47.14]Okay.
[147:48.34]We are time to explore the ziggurat.
[147:54.71]Here's a sanctuary.
[148:11.64]Give me a guide.
[148:12.32]Although I kind of... What else do I want to do here?
[148:20.32]Salt bonus.
[148:21.10]Give me the leader.
[148:24.28]Resistance bonus.
[148:26.46]Yeah.
[148:31.83]Alright.
[148:32.77]Fuck the rest of you.
[148:36.21]Work.
[148:39.45]Oh.
[148:40.27]Uh...
[148:42.34]Okay.
[148:44.50]Do I have... I've got some caged ears for you.
[148:47.72]Okay, this is holy damage.
[148:59.25]Rub it to restore fatigue.
[149:04.07]I guess I could take one of these.
[149:10.82]I don't know.
[149:12.30]No, I don't want to turn that in.
[149:14.10]Not yet.
[149:14.42]I don't even really know what the hell I'm doing.
[149:18.60]Is it quests for this guy?
[149:23.57]Whatever.
[149:33.29]Can I not transmute the thing that I have on?
[149:46.62]Uh, hold on a second.
[149:59.40]I can?
[149:59.80]Why can I not transmute the great hammer?
[150:03.20]Is it upgraded too much or something?
[150:11.02]What does she say?
[150:12.12]Shall we transmute your gear?
[150:15.60]No.
[150:19.75]Was I just not seeing it on the menu?
[150:23.51]No.
[150:25.33]Huh.
[150:28.31]So you can't transmute the thing that I already have.
[150:30.41]Maybe it's because I've already upgraded it.
[150:33.01]I don't know.
[150:36.09]I have no idea.
[150:38.79]But... Bye.
[150:43.39]That's a different enemy.
[150:45.23]It's like a huge mouth of werewolf.
[150:50.48]No, I can't jump it.
[150:51.82]Well, I don't know what you do, but you look scary.
[150:54.44]He just runs.
[150:56.68]Okay, I'm scared.
[150:57.56]Oh, Jesus, I heard about you.
[150:59.28]You killed my big father.
[151:00.26]Where'd he go?
[151:09.09]This guy doesn't do anything.
[151:10.31]This guy just runs around.
[151:28.80]You really don't do anything, do you?
[151:32.84]Oh yeah, of course he does.
[151:33.90]Now I say it and he starts actually attacking.
[151:46.65]Now he's saying bring it on.
[151:47.69]He's smashing his hands on the ground.
[151:48.99]He doesn't do anything.
[151:57.31]Action, Olsen, please.
[151:59.90]He doesn't do anything.
[152:06.58]Charred doll.
[152:10.66]And a treasure chest.
[152:17.92]Ooh, lots of new stuff.
[152:23.08]Dexterity.
[152:26.21]Not strength.
[152:27.35]Dexterity only.
[152:32.49]But I did get a lot of other plate.
[152:34.97]Where is it?
[152:37.09]The Criken helm.
[152:40.55]Where is it?
[152:46.40]Was it not a helmet?
[152:48.82]Plate mail.
[152:54.74]No, I don't want that.
[152:55.84]I want my dirty clothes.
[152:59.36]Maybe I'll put on the plate gauntlets.
[153:03.77]Yeah, I'll put on the plate gauntlets.
[153:07.95]Plate greaves.
[153:08.75]Nice.
[153:10.53]59.
[153:12.05]Just barely.
[153:13.30]Yeah, I can still move around.
[153:16.20]Cool.
[153:22.05]But we are hammer dude.
[153:24.13]So, you know.
[153:25.35]Might as well check it all.
[153:33.81]Okay, another scaredy cat werewolf.
[153:43.86]He's not scared.
[153:48.64]Ow.
[153:51.26]Ow.
[154:00.35]Okay.
[154:06.63]I can grab that.
[154:07.77]No, I can't.
[154:13.06]Skeleton mages.
[154:17.82]Come down here so I can kill you.
[154:21.24]Get over here.
[154:21.66]Are you just going to sit there and spam fire?
[154:25.68]Where are you?
[154:32.17]See?
[154:32.89]I came and got you.
[154:34.11]I didn't even need.
[154:35.35]I didn't even need you to come down.
[154:43.22]Not a secret door.
[154:53.58]Up we go.
[154:54.60]I don't know what this does.
[155:05.54]Just sort of makes you able to jump, like, up there easier.
[155:12.50]Huh.
[155:16.55]Stop spamming arc fire.
[155:23.77]Now I can jump up here.
[155:30.92]That's not a way to go, but this is.
[155:35.87]Oops-a-daisy.
[155:36.51]Oh, boy.
[155:44.52]Ugh.
[155:47.18]Ugh, this is awkward as all hell.
[155:52.44]Wait, can I go?
[155:53.24]No.
[155:56.44]I hate when you go to upside-down world.
[156:00.78]Like, I don't even know.
[156:01.88]I don't know.
[156:03.44]Apparently, I'm okay still, I guess.
[156:07.13]I can fall up now.
[156:08.39]Remember that.
[156:13.07]Jesus.
[156:19.60]God.
[156:23.06]Was it worth it?
[156:24.20]Stone charm.
[156:25.00]Increases stagger damage.
[156:30.30]I'm not doing that.
[156:36.08]Good luck getting back down.
[156:37.76]This is going to put me in a completely different place.
[156:49.42]Stone guide.
[156:53.24]Shit.
[156:57.44]Can I fall here?
[157:00.22]I don't know.
[157:01.46]Yeah, I can.
[157:01.90]I just didn't know if the ground didn't work.
[157:05.81]Let me look over this way.
[157:10.59]Anything else?
[157:14.45]Not really.
[157:21.96]Secret door?
[157:24.56]Really?
[157:24.86]No.
[157:26.86]No secret door.
[157:27.60]I find that hard to believe.
[157:39.49]Guess I have to part two open up.
[157:44.32]Is that all I could do up this way?
[157:45.36]I don't even remember.
[157:48.70]If I don't touch that, what happens to me when I fall down there?
[157:55.41]Fuck, I don't know.
[157:56.59]Am I gonna die if I drop back down?
[157:59.13]Hope not.
[158:01.09]Almost did.
[158:05.47]Yeah, all that does is lead back down here.
[158:10.02]Well, shit.
[158:16.52]Too much upside-down bullshit, because I don't even know what's up and what's down or where to go.
[158:33.07]Guess I can...
[158:47.38]I need to get up there.
[158:48.26]I don't know.
[158:57.16]The only thing I can think of is I have to go back down to where I started and go a different way.
[159:01.44]So that means all the way down there.
[159:06.65]You gotta go upside down again.
[159:07.97]I just want to take a look-see.
[159:15.55]Yeah, I guess...
[159:17.94]I guess I'll have to just fall upwards.
[159:21.37]Although that's going to be tricky.
[159:26.31]Let's find out.
[159:27.89]I need to go up there.
[159:43.19]Let's see where we go.
[159:51.40]Where do we end up over here?
[160:02.66]This is there.
[160:03.46]It's right there.
[160:05.22]Can I... Okay, there we go.
[160:09.65]Yep.
[160:10.49]Anything else over here?
[160:11.33]No.
[160:14.63]God, that's so disorienting.
[160:19.89]That's so disorientating.
[160:25.81]And a chest.
[160:28.07]Come on.
[160:28.51]No.
[160:30.65]No.
[160:30.93]I'm alive.
[160:39.20]Stupid.
[160:40.20]Stupid.
[160:41.80]Stupid.
[160:51.85]Thank god I had full health.
[160:53.65]And just barely enough to not die there.
[160:59.44]Another squid person treasure chest, guys.
[161:02.20]Watch out for the squid person that eats you.
[161:03.85]It takes 80% of your health.
[161:05.55]Watch out.
[161:06.69]I told you to watch out.
[161:11.05]Squidward on bath salts.
[161:12.49]There's a boss right here.
[161:16.17]Alright.
[161:17.23]Let me just get into my brain here.
[161:23.42]How to get back over this way.
[161:26.69]So it's up there.
[161:28.45]Where's the sanctuary?
[161:29.33]It's right down there, right?
[161:31.98]Just make sure I got it.
[161:34.14]Let's see what she does.
[161:44.00]Splatoon.
[161:44.68]Alright, we're doing first try.
[161:53.18]Come on.
[161:54.52]First try, the Dried King.
[162:00.03]Here we go.
[162:01.51]What do you got?
[162:03.25]Nothing.
[162:06.04]Just be aggressive.
[162:07.86]Just don't stay under the lights.
[162:13.88]Easy.
[162:17.68]This is just siphon filter.
[162:39.32]First try.
[162:46.14]That guy was easy.
[162:54.16]Yeah.
[162:55.16]I did it.
[162:55.70]I did it.
[162:56.34]I did it.
[162:56.66]I did it.
[162:57.44]I did it.
[162:58.72]I did it.
[162:59.10]Let's go.
[163:06.48]My secret door.
[163:14.78]Weird staircase.
[163:16.70]New NPC.
[163:18.77]And a super skip.
[163:21.65]What is this van?
[163:22.05]What do you want, Dracula?
[163:24.19]So you killed him?
[163:24.79]You killed the king?
[163:26.87]Quite a relief.
[163:27.79]But is this a dream?
[163:29.97]The cigarette wearing him well.
[163:31.29]It reminds me of that great tomb built by the Sun King.
[163:35.57]Kul Kulkan is where I studied until the mission.
[163:39.45]We were to sail to the west for a marriage alliance, I think.
[163:42.97]No, that's wrong.
[163:44.07]The guy doesn't even know his own past.
[163:46.12]We were to sail east to live in.
[163:48.46]We were to make peace with the citadel of fire and sky and song of ice and fire.
[163:52.24]Kul Kulkin, sitting king, just had to announce that... I don't care.
[163:56.82]So we sailed.
[163:58.14]There was a storm of seas.
[164:00.71]I was washed up.
[164:02.19]I didn't think any of my fellow friends lived.
[164:05.43]When I found this cigarette, I thought I'd gone mad.
[164:08.59]But I'm no stranger to dark magic.
[164:11.04]Imagine a demon that feels off the ruins of the nations.
[164:15.02]A demon that collects.
[164:16.89]Such a powerful being it could do on this island.
[164:19.42]Or perhaps this man is the demon himself.
[164:21.92]And it feeds climbing, charming women and kings and countries.
[164:25.94]I want you to explain to my theory and why I just left the thing to help you do it.
[164:30.98]I have something for you.
[164:31.76]It might burn.
[164:33.18]Here.
[164:37.97]Thanks.
[164:40.03]Dirt brand.
[164:41.53]If you find the ruined temple, you'll know my theory is true.
[164:44.63]What about you?
[164:45.25]Do you agree?
[164:46.55]Yeah.
[164:47.62]Of course.
[164:48.22]This island is a gravestone of civilization.
[164:51.06]Find the ruined temple.
[164:52.06]We'll get to the bottom of this one.
[164:53.38]Yeah, yeah.
[165:00.58]Where does this lead me?
[165:03.02]Ah.
[165:04.16]The ruined temple is where I was.
[165:14.73]What?
[165:14.89]You don't like how I was reading that?
[165:17.51]Stop mispronouncing.
[165:18.89]I'm just... I'm reading.
[165:19.95]What are you saying?
[165:21.83]Use the horn.
[165:26.45]Let's go.
[165:31.24]Let's go back here.
[165:31.92]Into the secret door.
[165:33.86]Alright.
[165:38.60]Where's the ruined temple?
[165:44.89]I was just in it.
[165:49.47]It was down and around, right?
[165:52.21]Well, first let me level the fuck up.
[165:56.37]It was a Shia, whatever.
[166:06.49]Yeah, the treasure, the secret treasure of the Mayan temple.
[166:16.86]Tree of skill.
[166:22.40]This is class two.
[166:25.34]Class three.
[166:26.02]We're going to go this way.
[166:32.22]This is three.
[166:36.30]Let's put another point in strength.
[166:43.70]Okay.
[166:46.16]So, I think actually I'm in a spot I need to be in.
[166:53.21]Because coming out here and going back down, I can get back to the temple, right?
[166:59.79]Not down, um, to the other side.
[167:10.79]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[167:12.93]Do-do-do-do-do-do-do.
[167:14.31]Oh.
[167:27.56]Ziggurat, a sanctuary of dust.
[167:29.76]Yeah, isn't it right here?
[167:31.64]This is where I was.
[167:35.15]Isn't this the ruined temple down here?
[167:36.59]If I go... Keep going this way.
[167:41.27]Right?
[167:42.11]Right?
[167:42.73]Huh?
[167:43.57]Huh?
[167:44.31]Huh?
[167:49.92]Be brave.
[167:50.66]Be brave, you pile of shit.
[168:09.41]Why don't I have an Oscar?
[168:10.38]I don't know.
[168:13.94]I was never nominated for something.
[168:15.08]Oh, what do I do?
[168:21.13]Fear him.
[168:28.43]Ow, I just bumped my hand.
[168:45.10]I hope I'm going the right way.
[168:46.92]I hope I'm going the right way.
[168:52.11]The ruined temple!
[168:59.63]We made it!
[169:02.48]Uh, I wasn't paying attention to what the guy was saying.
[169:07.68]What, uh... What did I need to do here?
[169:13.51]He said, go to the ruined temple and you'll see.
[169:17.18]You'll find what you need to seek in the ruined temple.
[169:21.56]And what was I needing to seek?
[169:29.21]That still hit me and he was standing on top of that thing.
[169:49.02]Listen to me, son!
[170:00.05]I'm your dad!
[170:10.72]Destroy him!
[170:16.00]Whoa!
[170:16.28]Whoa, Idea Shark.
[170:17.62]Welcome.
[170:17.94]Thanks, Idea Shark.
[170:18.64]Welcome.
[170:19.32]Welcome, welcome, welcome.
[170:20.30]Whoa.
[170:30.42]I'm trying to remember what I needed to do.
[170:32.89]You know what I'm saying?
[170:58.93]Listen to me, son!
[171:00.09]Listen to me, son!
[171:01.99]I'm your dad!
[171:02.49]Destroy him!
[171:08.65]Whoa!
[171:11.83]Wiley93.
[171:13.96]Welcome, thanks.
[171:14.58]I'm just gonna travel back there again.
[171:18.86]I don't think I need to be here.
[171:28.60]Come out here.
[171:40.54]Talk to the boat guy again?
[171:41.66]No.
[171:52.22]I'm lost.
[171:53.44]I'm lost.
[171:54.36]I'm lost.
[171:54.74]I gotta be getting near the end of the game too.
[171:57.58]Right?
[172:00.79]Where did I come out?
[172:03.81]I'm just going piece by piece here.
[172:05.57]I came out over here.
[172:07.99]Did something else open?
[172:13.12]Should I just keep going this way?
[172:18.50]This is not where I came out.
[172:19.72]I came out like on the side of the pyramid.
[172:33.00]I don't care about what this guy's doing, but he's probably gonna kill me.
[172:35.06]No.
[172:35.12]Is this a person?
[172:46.99]Huh?
[172:48.95]I'm pleased to have been able to make an impact on your journey.
[172:51.69]Moonlight has always been my friend.
[172:53.71]Now I can call you a friend.
[172:56.98]Okay.
[172:58.46]May moonlight shroud you in this light.
[173:00.38]He just gave me, like, all his clothes.
[173:02.47]What do they do?
[173:10.99]Uh.
[173:12.05]Class 2 light armor.
[173:13.11]I don't even want to look at it.
[173:18.35]Shithead.
[173:23.41]Ugh.
[173:48.27]I don't know what to do.
[173:48.95]I don't need to go this way.
[174:11.33]Because there's no reason for me to go all the way back.
[174:13.35]Because that's just going to take me back to... I thought he was an NPC.
[174:15.45]I was going to talk to him.
[174:17.97]Resident sleeper.
[174:18.89]Resident sleeper.
[174:19.89]Resident sleeper.
[174:22.16]Sleep.
[174:22.68]Sleep.
[174:23.22]Put me to sleep.
[174:24.32]You're putting me to fucking sleep.
[174:31.60]No, no, no.
[174:33.25]I actually didn't even go down here.
[174:36.43]I guess this is what we're gonna do.
[174:40.13]Flail and a stone cleric.
[174:46.19]God, could this be any more boring?
[174:48.75]Resident sleeper.
[175:00.36]No.
[175:05.77]How do I do that?
[175:13.65]Go back to Earth.
[175:18.53]Where this brand to gain the ability to perform the mid-air dash.
[175:22.62]Eh?
[175:24.82]Mid-air dash?
[175:30.28]Are you kidding me?
[175:33.52]Hold on.
[175:40.64]What is R2 that's not... What did I bind R2 to?
[175:43.88]It's triangle.
[175:44.88]Triangle.
[175:53.15]I hate that so much.
[175:55.77]All of my key bindings are different than what they are on the screen.
[176:02.99]Was R2 well airborne?
[176:04.46]R2 used to be.
[176:21.85]No, that's L1.
[176:22.63]Because that is triangle.
[176:28.51]So what happened to R2?
[176:32.08]There it is.
[176:32.56]Okay.
[176:34.58]Alrighty.
[176:39.16]So now... Push R2, D2.
[176:42.06]Yeah, I could have.
[176:52.15]Oh, that's cool.
[176:54.11]Have you tried every button yet?
[176:55.45]I have.
[176:55.99]I just did.
[176:58.43]R2 is circle.
[177:12.58]This is a good speedrun strategy, huh?
[177:20.71]So now that I'm here again...
[177:24.38]This is the ruined temple down here.
[177:26.45]Is there a way I can do like a dash?
[177:34.23]I guess.
[177:34.59]If I go up there.
[177:41.32]World record pace.
[177:42.20]I know, it's getting close.
[177:57.20]Here we go.
[178:00.08]Yay!
[178:00.60]I did a dash across a thing I couldn't get to.
[178:08.66]Secret door.
[178:11.06]Let me get this first.
[178:13.55]Warhorn.
[178:24.65]Come on, secret.
[178:26.96]I haven't seen any secret doors.
[178:34.50]Yoink.
[178:38.22]This looks like a new spot.
[178:42.66]Could be.
[178:43.21]A couple places.
[178:45.83]We'll go up first.
[178:49.55]This is back here.
[178:50.59]I'm gonna go back down.
[179:00.96]and jump across this.
[179:08.48]Whoa.
[179:13.70]Is this game trolling me right now?
[179:15.58]I think it is.
[179:16.02]That's not...
[179:29.32]I almost just ran off to my death.
[179:32.13]It almost happened.
[179:32.87]It was close.
[179:45.16]Shimmy down the ladder.
[179:55.74]Lots of up downs here.
[179:58.83]I don't really like the up-downs.
[179:59.91]I actually need those idols.
[180:18.54]Why are people turning into robots again?
[180:31.98]This is new.
[180:33.94]All of this is new.
[180:40.82]Just want to take a peek.
[180:45.16]God.
[180:45.78]Another one of these stupid doors.
[180:46.94]There has to be something eventually I can do down here, right?
[180:54.71]How'd that guy get over there?
[180:55.55]There's a bottle right there.
[180:57.31]How did you do that?
[181:00.05]You sneaky guy.
[181:16.55]I'm gonna go... I guess do this to see if we can... I'm gonna say there's a door at the end.
[181:27.87]This is annoying.
[181:28.69]This is not fun.
[181:30.75]Are you serious?
[181:43.62]What is the point of this?
[181:45.28]I mean, I really thought there was going to be something over here.
[181:47.88]I guess not.
[181:55.70]The only way to go is over here.
[181:56.87]What the fuck?
[182:28.80]I can do it.
[182:34.06]I don't like this at all.
[182:35.16]I don't like what I'm doing right now.
[182:39.08]Jeez, okay.
[182:52.83]Still going.
[182:55.08]Still going with bats everywhere.
[182:56.82]This is really, really weird.
[183:03.50]This is really weird.
[183:04.58]Now the question is,
[183:16.23]I guess I just do this, right?
[183:18.77]Go get the stuff that's over... I'm gonna fucking die doing that.
[183:21.41]Not yet.
[183:22.46]I want to make sure I find whatever else is over here that I need to do.
[183:25.02]Because I will fucking die going down here.
[183:30.28]Absolutely.
[183:31.39]Who are these people?
[183:32.15]What the hell are these mask people?
[183:35.31]Came out of nowhere.
[183:35.83]Jesus.
[183:38.07]Jesus.
[183:51.30]I have like no stamina!
[183:56.28]Almost just knocked me off the edge.
[183:57.84]Almost.
[184:13.69]Whoa!
[184:17.19]These guys throw weird puke bombs.
[184:20.80]I don't even know what they are.
[184:24.92]What?
[184:28.10]How'd he die back there?
[184:28.96]Okay, hold on.
[184:39.00]Hold on a second.
[184:39.56]I think I figured this out a little.
[184:43.63]Just a little bit.
[184:48.30]No, I can only do it twice.
[184:51.98]Unless I can... No secret door.
[185:07.74]Maybe I have to be going upside down.
[185:09.36]I'm not going to pretend to know the answer to that question.
[185:19.32]Can't hook onto that?
[185:20.05]Really?
[185:22.19]Seems like I can.
[185:22.81]Okay.
[185:25.19]Check out for the masks.
[185:41.64]This is that exit to... Yeah.
[185:46.24]This turns into like a puzzle game.
[186:03.08]Haha!
[186:03.98]Not this time.
[186:04.64]Holy fuck.
[186:07.91]Holy crap.
[186:09.87]I did not see the guys with the masks.
[186:12.99]But I will chase them nonetheless.
[186:21.70]Not this time.
[186:25.55]Fool me once.
[186:26.59]Shame on me.
[186:28.29]Fool me twice.
[186:30.39]Shame on you.
[186:31.99]Fool me three times.
[186:33.72]Or four times.
[186:34.66]It probably was like five, but you know.
[186:43.08]Wow.
[186:44.34]I actually thought I was gonna grab the edge.
[186:50.11]This game has so many paths.
[186:52.25]It does.
[186:54.13]And it has a lot of up-down.
[186:57.33]There are a huge, actually a huge amount of up-down in this game.
[187:04.52]To a point where it gets extremely confusing.
[187:08.88]Because I mean, up-down, it's a huge area.
[187:13.59]And it's all up-down.
[187:14.27]I guess I could try this way.
[187:21.59]Because you can go up or down, and I went that way.
[187:26.84]Now I have the opportunity to come back here.
[187:29.64]Just chill for a second and level up.
[187:53.52]Huh.
[187:55.00]You know, I just don't know.
[187:58.34]Could save for that and I'll do another point in strength.
[188:04.94]You know, I'm just not sure.
[188:14.10]But I have to pee.
[188:15.88]So I'm gonna go pee.
[188:18.50]And I suggest you all do the same.
[188:21.51]I'll be back in like two or three minutes.
[188:25.46]Go get yourself a snack.
[188:27.34]I'm going to try the boss that's in this area once or twice and then we'll see.
[188:32.80]I don't know.
[188:33.72]I'll be right back.
[188:39.30]Hey, shake dog.
[191:06.07]Hey.
[191:09.13]Rock music.
[191:13.64]Rock music.
[191:22.06]Got awfully quiet in here, huh?
[191:28.39]That's the fire.
[191:30.57]The crackling of the flames is me pissing.
[191:33.99]No, come on, guys.
[191:34.77]You guys know that's not how it works.
[191:37.73]That's not how it works, guys.
[191:38.87]Attack bonus.
[191:44.55]And I want to look at you.
[191:45.35]Come here.
[191:47.49]I need some smithing.
[191:50.09]Hey!
[191:50.43]I need some smithing down.
[191:57.16]I do have two of these now.
[191:59.82]I'm going to go for it.
[192:07.74]Super Warhammer.
[192:13.28]This thing is a beast.
[192:15.78]It is a beast.
[192:21.24]Anything you can give me though.
[192:29.16]Hmm.
[192:31.22]What else do you have?
[192:33.80]Nothing.
[192:34.06]I don't want any of your crap.
[192:40.05]One page of light.
[192:41.04]I didn't even look at what that does.
[192:49.46]Oh!
[192:52.54]Okay, so that's replenishable.
[192:57.50]That's interesting.
[193:05.57]That is interesting.
[193:09.64]Not enough for me to really care.
[193:11.66]Sorry.
[193:13.96]He's a flail.
[193:16.48]Yeah, I kind of don't care.
[193:17.28]I kind of don't care.
[193:19.80]I just want to keep going.
[193:33.68]Hmm.
[193:39.89]Okay, I'm done with you.
[194:01.94]Ah, the French champagne.
[194:05.68]Has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[194:09.88]Crazy Carl!
[194:12.80]Welcome back.
[194:15.48]Thank you for the resub.
[194:17.12]Welcome back.
[194:19.85]I appreciate you.
[194:20.91]Let's just see what else is over there.
[194:31.45]Is there something else I can cling on to now that I have the super dash?
[194:36.66]I'm sure there is something up here, probably.
[194:41.75]How come they run?
[194:43.17]Some of them run, some of them don't.
[194:44.13]You know what?
[194:50.49]I'm going to go this way.
[194:54.27]Sometimes they just get angry and they start attacking.
[195:07.36]Did I finish Undertale?
[195:09.44]Yes, I did.
[195:12.19]It was a while back.
[195:12.97]It was back in like January.
[195:15.71]Oh, I thought I was going to be... Get away from me, please.
[195:39.10]Anything else?
[195:44.10]Get a BA emote?
[195:46.02]I probably will.
[195:46.66]Oh, that's the chest.
[195:52.98]It's the annoying chest that doesn't do anything.
[196:02.51]Okay, this is where I beat... I already killed this boss.
[196:10.91]fuck am I supposed to do here?
[196:13.65]I already beat the boss.
[196:15.07]There's a person here.
[196:15.91]This is the ruined temple.
[196:29.72]I don't know.
[196:36.23]Because this is the end.
[196:37.09]This is inside the ziggurat.
[196:44.42]Put it back in the holster.
[196:49.38]I can't fit down here?
[196:51.52]Squeeze down there.
[197:01.81]Down to the lower left, maybe?
[197:06.79]Where was that area?
[197:08.95]Remember, it's like a little grassy area?
[197:11.76]The pitchforks.
[197:13.94]I've gone there like two times now and you can jump across.
[197:16.54]It's been more than one way to go there.
[197:27.83]Oh boy.
[197:32.80]Let's dance, amigo!
[197:37.10]That game is fantastic.
[197:38.18]I love that game.
[197:40.20]That's a game of the fucking century for me right now.
[197:53.33]Being poisoned is not cool.
[197:54.95]Just gonna chill here.
[198:05.97]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[198:10.70]Can I drop down this way?
[198:13.14]No.
[198:17.00]I'm gonna clean this town up!
[198:20.99]So your mama let you come out and play today.
[198:23.21]What a fucking fantastic video game.
[198:35.65]I'm so glad that you guys are all quoting this.
[198:38.58]There's a time for living, and there's a time for dying.
[198:44.72]And your time is now, or whatever he says.
[199:02.76]I don't know if this is the right way, but I'm gonna go.
[199:05.95]No.
[199:06.01]This is the ziggurat.
[199:13.75]Where the fuck am I going right now?
[199:15.99]Ugh.
[199:22.22]Bruin temples where I fought the big fat guy the huge stone monster wasn't he in the ruined temple wasn't that like right here somewhere Like I swear I swear to God there's like one little fucking ladder and
[199:44.93]need to go down oh there you are you made it out of the like 6 000 feet of platforms and ladders and walls you found the one place you needed to go to I swear to god it's back here and then you just can't isn't this where I fought the
[200:13.11]I'm going back here.
[200:14.79]Because, like, this is the other side of the pyramid.
[200:17.89]Right?
[200:18.09]And then isn't it just down... Can't I just go down?
[200:24.42]Like, why do I feel like I have to go down here?
[200:26.44]Because down here is, like, part of the ziggurat.
[200:34.34]Right?
[200:34.54]I just want to...
[200:41.17]Okay, okay.
[200:41.83]Hey, how are you?
[200:42.73]What's up?
[200:44.73]That's exactly what I was looking for.
[200:46.13]French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[200:52.87]Evo Sigma 1.
[200:54.99]Welcome.
[200:56.21]Thanks for the sub.
[201:04.53]Thanks for the resub, actually.
[201:05.55]That was a resub.
[201:09.24]That was a resubscription.
[201:28.85]Everything looks the same to me.
[201:31.25]Everything looks the same.
[201:33.52]Where am I?
[201:34.16]Everything's the same.
[201:38.56]Everything's the same.
[201:40.42]It's like I'm doing Scooby Doo stuff.
[201:41.96]We're going in different doors and the villain went in the other one.
[201:48.47]Jesus.
[201:59.20]It's Groundhog Day.
[202:04.32]Crate of salt.
[202:06.19]That sounds like a lot.
[202:09.27]Gray pearl.
[202:12.65]Oh boy.
[202:13.25]I don't even know which way I should be going.
[202:19.12]I don't know.
[202:19.74]Okay.
[202:23.54]I can't, we're in another door.
[202:28.78]Get me out of this.
[202:38.63]I don't know where this is.
[202:44.51]Crossbow?
[202:48.33]They're all such short little rooms to...
[202:58.94]I am having some serious trouble here.
[203:10.87]Russet leggings?
[203:15.17]Is that the only reason why I came over here?
[203:20.49]That can't be the only thing that's down here.
[203:22.13]No.
[203:25.54]Another opening.
[203:31.89]I really hope this leads me to something.
[203:33.28]Because every single one of these rooms has been identical in my brain.
[203:36.40]At least I have plenty of health potions.
[203:59.11]Oh shit.
[204:02.25]Shit shit, I'm not gonna make it.
[204:08.59]I'm not gonna make it Jesus Damn it
[204:45.59]Where is this taking me?
[204:47.71]Huh?
[204:50.85]Where am I?
[204:54.64]You can't be serious.
[204:58.30]You can't be serious.
[205:04.92]I don't know if I can do this.
[205:07.98]I don't think I can do this.
[205:15.44]I have no idea where I am.
[205:18.42]I don't know which way to go, or which way is even remotely correct.
[205:27.60]I'm gonna get it wrong.
[205:28.78]I just know I am.
[205:31.48]I'm gonna say, I'm just gonna go left.
[205:34.13]I'm gonna have to sit here.
[205:34.83]I don't care if I sit here for 30 minutes to get this right.
[205:36.93]Okay.
[205:41.53]Okay.
[205:43.21]This one, back to here.
[205:44.99]I have to jump off that wall.
[205:50.69]No, because the other one disappears.
[205:57.22]Isn't that logically what would make sense?
[205:59.36]This one, down to the lower right, up to the left.
[206:02.58]But then how do I go from there?
[206:07.86]Okay, here we go.
[206:10.03]Middle.
[206:11.28]Down to the right.
[206:12.46]Wall jump over to the left.
[206:13.66]Jump again.
[206:14.98]And I should be there.
[206:16.30]This is where it starts.
[206:17.04]This is where it starts.
[206:18.88]This is where it begins.
[206:26.18]No, hold on.
[206:29.44]Maybe that to that.
[206:31.66]And then, okay, hold on.
[206:32.76]I got it.
[206:35.37]This is what's going to happen here.
[206:39.29]Oh, there's a ground.
[206:39.83]How was I supposed to fucking know that?
[207:17.42]There was no way for me to know that the unicorn beetles are just gonna skew you and run you and you die instantly.
[207:26.87]It's 95% of your health.
[207:35.10]Un-fucking-believable.
[207:37.16]Seriously.
[207:37.98]Unbelievable.
[207:41.73]Hey, watch out.
[207:42.65]Watch out.
[207:43.07]We have another insta-kill move you need to be careful you don't get hit by.
[207:46.75]Is this the first time you've ever seen this enemy?
[207:49.83]Yeah, you're gonna die by it.
[207:51.88]It's gonna skewer you.
[207:56.34]Back to square one, guys.
[207:57.30]Back to square fucking one.
[208:02.40]I... I think I'm just gonna rage quit the stream.
[208:15.29]It's so terrible.
[208:18.10]I'm trying to like find the way to go.
[208:19.94]That probably wasn't even the right way.
[208:56.20]I don't know.
[208:57.92]I don't know.
[208:59.54]I think I, uh... I think I'm just done.
[209:05.76]Yeah, that was just infuriating and awful.
[209:11.55]Yeah.
[209:12.77]Oh, lookit, I can go down here.
[209:14.35]Hey, remember this area?
[209:22.31]Ah, I do!
[209:28.17]No.
[209:32.27]I don't even think I'm supposed to be going that way.
[209:33.71]I really don't.
[209:48.07]I do an Undertale pacifist run.
[209:49.97]No, no.
[210:00.93]I just need to find the correct way.
[210:04.05]Like, can somebody just in the chat confirm if I need to be going this way?
[210:10.33]Because I need to go to the ruined temple, and I found my way there like once, axe-fucking-dently.
[210:15.99]Killed a giant, and now I can't figure out how to get back there.
[210:26.34]According to what I just googled, the pitch is a shitty zone and not mandatory.
[210:31.14]Mandatory.
[210:33.06]Okay.
[210:33.62]Well, I'm not doing it then.
[210:45.94]I need to remember how to get back to where the giant was.
[210:52.81]He was like down here.
[210:56.37]And over to the left.
[210:58.47]Right?
[211:00.77]Mandatory.
[211:01.43]Yeah, it was mandatory.
[211:12.57]This is where the giant was standing, right?
[211:15.29]If I remember.
[211:16.09]Wasn't he like over here?
[211:17.79]Yes.
[211:21.15]Ask Jeeves.
[211:23.40]Jeeves, how do I continue this game?
[211:33.85]You AltaVisted it.
[211:34.93]Man, that is a long time ago.
[211:37.95]You're bringing back memories that I don't think I remember having.
[211:41.57]Okay.
[211:52.34]So is this the temple over here?
[211:57.98]I'm in the ruined temple.
[212:02.80]How do I stay here?
[212:04.74]And what the fuck do I have to do here?
[212:07.27]This is the place where I was like flying around upside down and shit.
[212:17.15]I have no idea.
[212:23.93]I'm just going to keep going to the left.
[212:25.45]That's the only thing I'm going to do.
[212:27.89]If you guys see me not going left, I want you to scream in the chat.
[212:34.99]Like, if I'm not going left, there's a massive problem.
[212:51.90]I don't think I need to... No.
[212:52.98]I don't need to go this way.
[212:55.66]This is too much left.
[212:56.71]This is too left.
[213:04.41]People are gonna start screaming.
[213:29.95]We're still going left.
[213:31.11]We're going left still.
[213:32.77]See?
[213:37.29]Ow.
[213:45.01]We're going left.
[213:46.07]It's still going left.
[213:48.03]Okay.
[213:50.57]Now I'm at the bottom.
[213:57.37]Going left.
[213:59.73]Okay, easy.
[214:03.89]That's exactly where I needed to be.
[214:05.81]Yep.
[214:08.31]I thought this was a sanctuary.
[214:10.85]It's not a sanctuary.
[214:15.70]Oh goodness, these like peacock people.
[214:21.22]You're gonna put me inside of your cage?
[214:23.06]Not cool.
[214:28.18]Please.
[214:29.78]Please.
[214:31.28]Please.
[214:31.67]Huh.
[215:00.11]Almost.
[215:02.03]No, you got me.
[215:02.73]You mousetrapped me.
[215:05.51]And I'm going to fucking insta-kill move.
[215:11.65]I can't believe I just got mousetrapped after all that.
[215:21.02]I'm going left, see?
[215:21.80]Now I'm going left.
[215:26.86]What is that?
[215:28.46]Oh, it's an entry.
[215:29.19]I thought it was like a person for a second.
[215:31.41]Where am I?
[215:32.81]I'm going to get lost again.
[215:34.89]I don't want to get lost again.
[215:47.70]You're in the stupidest spot you could possibly be in.
[215:58.66]Okay, this is that spot here.
[216:02.47]I remember I was saying, why can I not jump up there?
[216:07.45]Let's see what it is.
[216:08.23]Increase attack power.
[216:12.27]Ooh.
[216:14.62]Ooh, yeah.
[216:16.72]Oh, that's what I'm talking about.
[216:19.54]No, I like this ring.
[216:22.76]Yeah, give me that one.
[216:24.39]More damage, baby.
[216:26.41]More damage.
[216:33.12]Give me that damage.
[216:35.72]Almost just killed myself.
[216:36.80]It was very close.
[216:37.74]I forgot that this existed.
[216:38.78]That was very, very close to killing myself.
[216:43.89]In fact, I actually don't even remember how far this is if I drop.
[216:48.37]Because I had to jump from... Okay, it's right there.
[216:54.52]It was another way for me to go.
[216:55.44]I didn't have to go in here.
[216:56.62]I could go up here.
[217:05.68]We press on.
[217:12.13]Diamond cluster.
[217:16.15]Sweet.
[217:18.41]Hateful jawbone.
[217:21.53]And a secret entrance.
[217:31.28]And that's where you get from here to there.
[217:35.47]Okay.
[217:40.39]Now, the real question of the day is why did that matter?
[217:46.67]Because it didn't really do anything.
[217:50.93]Like, where's... I guess maybe you do have to go back that way?
[218:03.21]This area is so fucking confusing, man.
[218:06.09]What is down here?
[218:07.59]If I'm just so inclined to make sure I know what's connected to this.
[218:10.53]Because this is supposed to be left.
[218:27.54]Go unright.
[218:32.10]Now I can go over there.
[218:36.81]Which leads to these dudes.
[218:44.69]Idle.
[218:44.95]Okay.
[218:49.37]Apparently I didn't grab the edge there.
[218:52.71]Which felt like I should have.
[218:54.31]I'm not going to lie.
[218:54.95]Felt like I fucking should have.
[219:06.82]See what I'm talking about about the up-down?
[219:11.34]There's too much up-down.
[219:22.75]Soldier's poem times three.
[219:25.29]Like, what the fuck?
[219:28.42]I could die.
[219:31.06]No, that just brings me back to where I was.
[219:44.66]And going left over here brings you back to the, yeah, brings you back all the way here.
[219:47.17]This is the red hall cages.
[219:57.08]I, I, I'm just, I'm going to go back up here and go this way.
[220:20.46]I wonder if I can get to a different spot.
[220:22.74]The problem is, like, I don't know what spot I'm supposed to be getting to.
[220:25.30]You know what I mean?
[220:30.34]Like, what spot am I trying to get to?
[220:32.72]This is where I ended up.
[220:58.36]Hold on.
[221:02.68]I think I can jump off the wall and grab that.
[221:06.66]I absolutely can.
[221:16.47]Breach Pike.
[221:18.75]Might as well look at it.
[221:22.56]S dexterity scaling.
[221:28.79]Oh, I'm totally lost.
[221:29.99]Yeah.
[221:31.55]I have no idea.
[221:34.51]All I know is, like... This level is more... This level is longer going straight up and down than it is left and right.
[221:49.04]This is the entrance to... Yeah, this is the Crayon's Pass.
[221:58.49]Awkward fucking place.
[222:10.05]What does this take me down here?
[222:11.43]I guess.
[222:32.46]Guess but isn't this a sanctuary.
[222:36.90]Thank God Goodness Thank you everything thank my lucky stars.
[222:54.74]Oh
[222:59.50]I'm going to make an offering here too.
[223:01.20]I want to bring some dudes.
[223:14.18]Okay.
[223:18.56]What do you got?
[223:20.10]You got anything cool?
[223:20.84]You know, I could buy like a bunch of these.
[223:30.01]They're kind of useful when you don't want to just waste a... You know.
[223:35.24]You don't want to waste any shit.
[223:42.20]How am I not tired of this game yet?
[223:43.44]Because I want to beat it.
[223:44.86]I have to be assuming I'm pretty close to the end.
[223:48.27]I'm not going this way, don't worry.
[223:49.57]I just wanted to see.
[223:50.27]Here it is.
[223:51.81]Sprites!
[223:55.73]Alright, leap of faith.
[223:56.73]There's definitely something on the other side!
[224:10.05]I just smashed my head.
[224:15.85]Alright, let's do it.
[224:16.53]I can go down this.
[224:29.46]We...
[224:37.28]That's a boss.
[224:38.54]This is a boss.
[224:40.99]Alright, found the boss.
[224:44.87]Is it a ghost?
[224:46.59]You see the ghost flying around?
[224:53.39]Alright, watch out for Casper, the friendly ghost.
[224:55.03]You have to punch his... Okay.
[225:01.25]He grabbed the axe.
[225:02.19]There's an axe.
[225:08.41]Okay, I don't know.
[225:10.11]This is kind of... Drop it again.
[225:13.36]This one guy, Lightning Resist, is what I need.
[225:24.32]Even if I might even just beat it.
[225:27.16]Maybe.
[225:27.42]I'm not making any promises.
[225:37.48]Not making any promises.
[225:43.86]What?
[225:44.70]You pinpointed that.
[225:46.06]Don't pinpoint me.
[225:53.63]You asshole.
[225:54.37]Throwing the stupid... End it.
[225:58.61]End it.
[226:00.35]Don't get greedy.
[226:00.87]Greedy.
[226:08.95]Sayonara.
[226:10.77]Game almost just crashed.
[226:14.99]Very close to the game crashing.
[226:22.32]Sanctuary is literally right here.
[226:23.64]Not a waste of time if I die over there.
[226:50.29]Mmmkayyyy.
[226:51.43]Strength skill... I have three?
[226:58.69]No.
[227:02.75]Two-handed class three great hammers.
[227:07.59]I'm gonna hold on to him.
[227:08.49]I'm not gonna use him right now.
[227:12.65]I have a shitload of money, though.
[227:13.83]Like, I need to spend it.
[227:15.32]Give me some items or something.
[227:16.70]Anything.
[227:21.29]Just give me like a bunch of these.
[227:22.21]Huh?
[227:35.66]Level up!
[227:44.88]I got a crate of salt.
[227:45.86]I might be able to level up again.
[227:49.08]Maybe.
[227:52.93]What's in the crate?
[227:57.27]Oh, 7,500.
[227:57.75]Nice.
[228:00.89]These are not worth it.
[228:02.91]100 each.
[228:08.10]Level up again.
[228:15.48]Can do the level 3 great hammers now.
[228:22.92]Three points of strength.
[228:23.80]Yeah, we can do that.
[228:29.54]Let's take a look.
[228:30.82]Observe and see what actually is over here on the left.
[228:36.47]After the boss.
[228:44.05]Well, that's just the fastest way to travel now.
[228:47.25]I apologize.
[228:49.52]That's annoying.
[229:01.10]Hello.
[229:06.84]We found it.
[229:07.28]Yes, we did.
[229:07.66]Became corrupted by greed and all kinds of other things.
[229:15.23]Yeah.
[229:17.89]I've had a sound of... Sound of... It's more identical to mine.
[229:23.65]Sorcerer's shit.
[229:26.10]You know, doing, like, pyromancy in this game might actually be kind of fun.
[229:29.71]Considering I found, like, a bunch of stave.
[229:34.65]I was trying to say staves and staves.
[229:36.03]Sorry.
[229:36.21]A bunch of staves and a ton of plus magic gear.
[229:40.92]I'm finding a lot of that.
[229:41.82]I'm finding that more than I'm finding, like, plate gear.
[229:45.02]Wait, what else do you have to say?
[229:45.96]Anything important?
[229:50.61]Yeah...
[229:55.36]Yeah, you gonna retrace your steps?
[229:57.64]Good luck.
[230:08.61]Anything else?
[230:10.50]Where is this taking me?
[230:18.06]That's a big, long, breakable bridge.
[230:28.11]I feel like these are going to attack me.
[230:33.06]I guess not.
[230:39.32]Pitch woods.
[230:40.60]Wait, this is where I came... This is where the stupid alien bird unicorns are.
[230:49.73]Don't.
[230:50.01]It's going to scare me again.
[230:53.39]It's too many of them.
[230:54.84]I knew it.
[230:55.26]I fucking... I'm dead.
[231:00.17]Yeah, I guess you just, like, can't attack those until they run a different way or something?
[231:04.27]I don't know.
[231:15.57]Bullshit.
[231:24.82]That's a bunch of bullshit.
[231:48.79]Let's go again.
[231:51.41]I'm going to burn those things alive.
[231:54.31]Next time I get down there.
[231:58.53]Why am I depressed?
[231:59.25]Because I get skewered by the unicorns again.
[232:01.11]And it did 100% of my HP.
[232:07.22]That's why I'm mad.
[232:14.10]Sugar only?
[232:14.62]Yeah, that's right.
[232:15.26]Sugar only.
[232:18.82]I'm trying to keep sugar only right now.
[232:24.09]But sugar only... The sugar in the sugar only has actually turned into... Just depressed.
[232:35.82]What's up here?
[232:36.32]Okay, that's an item.
[232:42.60]Charred Reliquary.
[232:43.96]Reliquary?
[232:44.86]Reliquary?
[232:48.01]Okay, I went right.
[232:49.35]Let's go left.
[232:53.52]Slam Lake.
[232:56.21]Where you get slammed.
[232:59.25]Which way should I go?
[233:03.17]Look how far we've come.
[233:04.47]I've been on this island for a long, long time.
[233:08.09]The air, the salt of the sea.
[233:10.23]It all hangs to me like an ancient crust.
[233:12.91]I'm the shipwrecked like you.
[233:14.09]So many shipwrecked sailors.
[233:15.09]So much fleshy flotsam.
[233:16.87]Fleshy flotsam with a sacred secret.
[233:24.58]Sanctuary?
[233:28.26]Uh, sanctuary.
[233:30.12]I'm gonna go here.
[233:37.62]Oh, wrong item.
[233:39.98]This one.
[233:47.22]Let's bring the blacksmith.
[233:55.91]Let's bring the guide.
[233:57.89]The salt man.
[233:59.97]And... That's all I want for now.
[234:09.84]What do you need from me now?
[234:11.48]I could give you this.
[234:12.68]In fact, I'm going to.
[234:19.14]Restore health and fatigue and cure poisoning.
[234:23.79]I mean, will this just add to my... I'm gonna do this.
[234:29.77]Will that give me nine?
[234:30.87]If it does, then that's cool.
[234:38.44]I'm doing it.
[234:40.91]No, I don't want anything from you.
[234:44.61]Yep.
[234:46.09]Okay, nice.
[234:47.77]Excellent.
[234:49.87]Alright, let's go in the slam jam.
[234:51.79]Wait.
[234:54.15]What's over here?
[235:03.60]Locked?
[235:06.20]It doesn't say it's locked.
[235:07.12]I just can't open it.
[235:14.32]Alright, we need to... Here's the anglerfish people.
[235:16.88]I feel like I was down here before.
[235:21.76]I was.
[235:22.04]Yeah, because this is the dome, right?
[235:31.32]Jump down, trust message.

[235:50.85]I saw it.
[235:51.43]I'm just gonna go back down.
[235:52.61]I just did... I just gotta get it right.
[236:11.10]If anyone ever goes back and watches this VOD, look, if you're watching this VOD right now, person in the future, can you count how many times I've died to an enemy and how many times I have died from fall damage?
[236:27.96]I would be shocked if it was not like a 60-40 at least of 60% being me falling.
[236:40.58]You just gotta fall with the water.
[236:43.20]Wherever the water goes, that's where you fall.
[236:47.88]Yep.
[236:50.79]Just fall with the water.
[236:58.49]Top yourself off.
[236:59.63]Fall with the water.
[237:00.39]Fall with the water.
[237:07.32]What is even down here?
[237:13.50]Dodge right.
[237:15.52]Dodge right.
[237:18.00]What does that mean?
[237:20.10]Why did the bottle tell me to do that?
[237:21.46]I don't know what that means.
[237:24.54]Woo!
[237:28.25]That's what it means.
[237:30.93]Look, it's Michael Jackson.
[237:34.39]What are you doing down here, Michael?
[237:36.77]Do you have a mark?
[237:41.02]Uh, huh?
[237:42.26]No?
[237:45.31]What?
[237:51.75]How do I get back up?
[237:58.45]Can I get back up?
[238:01.86]That water's not even coming from anywhere.
[238:05.00]Look at... That is a fake waterfall.
[238:11.90]I need a different mark.

[240:04.88]Too much weight.
[240:06.66]Too much weight.
[240:07.24]Is that weight, is it lightning or is that arcane?
[240:16.44]Because if it's arcane, I have like the wizard shit.
[240:20.02]Let's put it on.
[240:21.57]I think, yeah, this is arcane.
[240:23.45]No, I don't have to take this thing off.
[240:25.01]Look at how much arcane or distance this thing has.
[240:28.81]85, baby.

[241:29.80]Fire damage.
[241:36.37]There it is.
[241:36.83]Arcane.

[241:44.62]Rolling speed.

[241:47.78]Fatigue in combat.
[241:48.70]I don't know.
[241:49.16]I like that too.

[242:48.13]I wasn't paying attention.
[242:48.93]I was just trying to kill her as fast as I could and I ran out of stamina.
[242:50.67]She's dead.
[242:50.89]I'll kill her.
[242:51.89]This is not even hard.
[242:52.33]The game's not even hard.
[242:52.89]Not even a hard game.
[242:53.41]Trust me.

[244:47.76]Yes.
[244:48.66]Okay, bye.

[245:11.57]Those guys are not... No joke.
[245:17.37]I gotta change gear too.
[245:20.49]Definitely need to take off some of this shit.
[245:38.52]Sanctuary?
[245:40.42]Sanctuary?
[245:46.22]Come on, give me a sanctuary.
[245:50.36]Use the guys that throw the blood grenades.
[245:57.27]Dude, this hammer does so much damage.
[246:03.75]Ah, almost.
[246:09.07]Ah, come on.
[246:14.38]Just barely out of reach here.
[246:20.17]Maybe you just can't do that.
[246:25.50]Found it!
[246:27.22]Figured it out.
[246:38.85]I need a new weapon?
[246:39.53]I don't think so, man.
[246:40.41]Did you see how fast I just killed the witch?
[246:43.19]This thing is doing a stupid amount of damage.
[246:50.05]Okay, well, now I have to figure out where to be spit from.
[246:59.64]Can't go that way yet.
[247:15.36]Hmm...
[247:19.93]Yeah, shitload of strength and this thing almost fully upgraded is pretty damn good.
[247:29.58]I do want... Where's the willpower?
[247:31.50]I already have one, right?
[247:35.42]No, not willpower.
[247:38.60]This one.
[247:38.98]No.
[247:49.56]Actually, I'll make an offering here.
[247:51.72]Bring a guide.
[247:52.46]I don't need the blacksmith here just yet.
[247:58.25]I don't even know what the fuck you do, but who cares?
[248:17.65]No, I think I'm good.
[248:18.55]But I do want to take off this garbage I'm wearing.
[248:20.39]I'm wearing a lot of crap that I don't need to be wearing right now.
[248:30.59]God, I look so fucked.
[248:34.55]It's like executioner shit I have on.
[248:36.07]I look like such a psycho.
[248:47.40]61 it's class 4 light armor almost can put these on almost alright let's continue
[249:19.97]I'm playing Sonic the Hedgehog now.
[249:24.15]It's like Angel Island Zone.
[249:34.04]Good thing I accidentally hit that chest.
[249:36.03]There's a monster.
[249:45.35]Is there another one I can go in?
[249:46.31]No.
[249:54.34]Up and away.
[249:54.92]Fuck.
[250:11.26]I love this cartoon noise they make when they jump.
[250:16.24]That's like Fred Flintstone is about to go in the car and run.
[250:19.66]And drive the car.
[250:20.70]Here it comes.
[250:21.08]Ready?
[250:21.30]Oh, whatever.
[250:30.53]I'm just gonna go up.
[250:38.70]Okay.
[250:39.84]We'll go right first.
[250:41.72]Get rid of these docks.
[250:43.16]Whisperers!
[250:50.68]Is it blood just all over the place right now?
[250:52.14]What's going on?
[250:54.38]Why am I covering the walls in blood?
[250:58.87]You see that?
[251:02.17]Is this the blood dinner the guy's throwing?
[251:04.57]It must be it.
[251:05.59]He just covered me in blood.
[251:06.57]Is it like amplified damage or something?
[251:09.99]Saltless ashes.
[251:28.89]Watch out.
[251:29.95]Spear's got reach.
[251:32.19]See?
[251:32.87]I told you.
[251:35.92]Yeah, damn it.
[251:42.48]I thought I could go through that.
[251:43.38]I don't even know what I did.
[251:55.53]I don't know what the hell I was thinking there.
[251:58.21]I was just sitting there like, you know what?
[251:59.69]Maybe I can get him.
[252:03.89]Maybe I can get him.
[252:08.01]Aster Monolith.
[252:14.31]God damn it.
[252:15.15]It's a magic axe.
[252:17.99]Look at all this magic stuff.
[252:22.41]I've yet to find a better... I mean, this thing might be...
[252:28.66]See?
[252:29.00]Scaling.
[252:31.49]If I upgrade it, but I don't know.
[252:32.67]Because this is level 5.
[252:35.33]And it's at 151.
[252:36.15]You've got to imagine.
[252:39.87]A little bit of dex, too.
[252:42.99]I wish this wasn't magic.
[252:48.76]I'm actually not finding very many big two-handers that are strength.
[252:53.76]There's only been like a couple.
[252:54.62]Oh.
[252:57.37]Probably looks cool.
[252:59.17]Oh, well.
[253:04.93]The axe would be better.
[253:07.37]I'm scared to take that leap, though.
[253:22.38]Lord's orders.
[253:23.12]Let's try this again.
[253:29.42]Saved that one.
[253:32.02]And there's a secret door.
[253:38.23]Okay.
[253:40.39]Now, is this gonna work?
[253:41.87]Can I grab this?
[253:45.07]See?
[253:45.29]I'm talking about, like, what the fuck?
[253:46.48]It's not even, like, letting me see it.
[253:48.10]I can't even do it.
[253:51.44]No way, right?
[253:53.72]No, I can't do it.
[253:55.20]I can't grab it.
[253:59.45]No.
[254:00.06]It's... I'm gonna fall.
[254:01.22]I'll jump off and die.
[254:04.00]You definitely go up the other way and come down and back around.
[254:07.96]I'm certain of it.
[254:21.86]Scary dark hallway.
[254:28.55]Back at the Hall of Cages again.
[254:30.45]Why does everything have to connect to here?
[254:39.03]He's gone.
[254:41.35]Seriously, everything seems to connect to the Hall of Cages.
[254:44.09]Everything.
[254:47.51]Why is that the central hub zone in the whole game?
[255:00.27]You can't grab it with that attitude.
[255:01.91]I don't think I can grab it at all.
[255:10.10]Where am I going?
[255:11.10]Okay.
[255:14.02]I'm going to talk about a confusing level.
[255:25.35]Is this a boss?
[255:28.69]Nope.
[255:29.65]Just a scary enemy.
[255:32.91]Okay.
[255:46.10]Looks like I can go in here.
[255:48.74]Does this look like an entrance to anybody else?
[255:59.43]Dancing ring.
[256:01.73]Dancing.
[256:03.89]We're going to go dancing.
[256:06.81]Slash defense.
[256:07.65]I'll put it on.
[256:11.15]I guess there's nothing I can do here.
[256:23.28]Do I watch any TV series?
[256:24.32]Yes, I do.
[256:24.70]I watch Always Sunny in Philadelphia and Better Call Saul.
[256:28.72]I'd say those are my top two picks right now.
[256:39.20]Those are my top two picks.
[256:56.35]Can't go in that one.
[256:59.09]But I did open up the one that was over on the left.
[257:09.84]What?
[257:10.06]I don't know if I can agree with what just happened there, guys.
[257:19.33]I don't want to agree with it.
[257:20.55]I refuse.
[257:24.28]Again, I was swinging into him.
[257:25.76]I refuse.
[257:35.66]Looks like I can go down, too.
[257:40.24]A lot of places to go.
[257:54.12]I don't have any idea what this is bringing me.
[257:58.96]Oh, shit.
[257:59.48]A boss.
[258:01.28]No, not yet.
[258:03.40]Not yet.
[258:03.80]I need to be certain of where I'm going here.
[258:05.99]This is a skip somewhere.
[258:07.45]Come on.
[258:15.03]Son of a bitch.
[258:15.95]Please tell me there's a sanctuary right here.
[258:23.50]Blocked it.
[258:27.40]I'm wounded.
[258:28.02]I might just run by this guy.
[258:31.73]Yeah.
[258:32.95]No, I'm going to dash into that apparently.
[258:51.12]Even think about it.
[258:52.90]Still not dead.
[258:55.58]Jeez Louise.
[259:04.43]Whoa.
[259:07.91]What is that?
[259:09.97]What is that?
[259:15.19]What are you?
[259:16.05]What are you?
[259:23.76]Thanks, Bray.
[259:25.24]Come on.
[259:25.66]Where's the blacksmith and the guide and the guy that I know, my friends?
[259:32.28]Let me kill you first.
[259:34.80]Whoa.
[259:37.19]Whoa.
[259:39.67]Wait a second.
[259:42.33]What did I just find?
[259:44.55]I found a little bit of a secret.
[259:51.08]Frozen tomb.
[260:01.76]You got it.
[260:06.45]Red Ranger, I'm doing this for you.
[260:08.03]I'm dead.
[260:14.75]Of course he does a Sonic ball.
[260:29.65]Should I go up or down?
[260:30.59]I don't know.
[260:36.01]Like, where the fuck was that?
[260:37.51]It was like over here, right?
[260:44.74]No, that's not the right way.
[260:48.52]He was talking to the creature?
[260:49.96]It probably was.
[260:55.98]Going here, because that's the thing I opened.
[260:58.64]Alright, I know where I am.
[261:00.92]That's the skip right there.
[261:03.67]So I'm going to go destroy him.
[261:05.59]RedRanger on his, like, tenth account just subscribed.
[261:09.61]Thanks, RedRanger.
[261:12.17]Always appreciated.
[261:22.19]Wait a minute.
[261:22.61]Is this where I wanted to go?
[261:26.27]No, I can't.
[261:26.71]Yeah, I remember I went up here.
[261:28.66]I got sucked up this thing, right?
[261:30.14]It took me all the way around.
[261:33.40]And then I said, where am I?
[261:34.50]Oh, where am I?
[261:34.86]Where am I going?
[261:35.56]Oh, my God.
[261:36.08]And then it was right here.
[261:37.98]Because then this is where the boss is.
[261:39.36]We're just going to go look at the boss.
[261:47.69]The unskinned.
[261:48.67]That's kind of morbid looking.
[261:53.97]Two bosses here.
[261:57.53]Ooh.
[261:59.01]So you got a caster and then a guy that stomps around.
[262:03.63]This is probably going to be difficult.
[262:05.53]Probably.
[262:08.01]Especially because she just kind of floats around.
[262:12.09]Wow.
[262:13.93]Keeping track of two people.
[262:14.99]Maybe it's better to kill him first.
[262:17.05]Because she's on the ground now.
[262:19.23]I just have kind of no idea what's going on.
[262:22.88]How am I alive?
[262:29.33]Just separate them maybe?
[262:30.43]Just keep them far apart?
[262:38.05]Nope.
[262:42.12]Damn.
[262:45.20]There's a lot to pay attention to.
[262:46.70]I wish he would just stop running back and forth like a fucking idiot.
[262:56.62]That guy was just blindly sprinting back and forth.
[263:02.44]That was stupid.
[263:10.58]I'm assuming maybe... I'm going to put on fire?
[263:14.44]Like lightning maybe?
[263:15.22]I don't know.
[263:20.36]Just going to have to put on some damage dealing.
[263:22.82]I'll do fire again.
[263:23.66]Fire seems to be all... Fire good.
[263:25.04]Fire not bad.
[263:30.59]Let's try it again.
[263:35.67]Spit me out.
[263:38.40]I'll try holy.
[263:40.44]When you say holy, those guys are kind of demonic, right?
[263:45.48]Nope, wrong way.
[263:51.85]I'll try it.
[263:52.25]Can you just block me?
[264:13.54]We're gonna go with lightning.
[264:14.85]Let the power of holiness compel you.
[264:21.57]Let the- Oh, fuck.
[264:23.53]I can't even look at it right now.
[264:24.39]I don't know what I did.
[264:25.03]I think my phone just fell.
[264:26.93]Ooh, that hurts him.
[264:29.91]That hurts him a lot, don't it?
[264:33.88]Get fucking just spammed.
[264:36.86]Spam him.
[264:38.24]Spam him.
[264:39.94]Spam him.
[264:42.28]Ah!
[264:45.08]I don't know what's gonna happen.
[264:45.84]She's gonna cast those things and... Die!
[264:51.71]He's dead.
[264:53.29]Slow it down.
[264:53.71]Slow it down.
[264:54.15]I don't know what you're doing.
[265:00.45]Okay, those are gonna explode.
[265:04.02]Right?
[265:05.80]Right?
[265:07.42]Right?
[265:07.60]I haven't been able to pay attention to what you do.
[265:20.60]Okay.
[265:21.96]It doesn't really do anything.
[265:27.75]Fire good.
[265:29.43]Fire good.
[265:41.46]Slow down.
[265:42.10]Don't do anything dumb here.
[265:48.91]Without him.
[265:50.55]Running around.
[265:53.24]Jeez.
[265:59.26]Okay.
[266:00.44]Vanquished.
[266:09.45]Okay, holy good.
[266:11.43]Holy, holy worked.
[266:12.43]This is the next spot to go, I think.
[266:28.48]What is left?
[266:30.00]Crypt of the Dead Gods.
[266:39.90]I have a feeling I'm getting close to the end of this video game.
[266:45.94]Case of salt.
[266:55.61]Oh, there's a goddamn rock monster.
[267:08.94]Sanctuary.
[267:11.01]Really looking for one right now.
[267:18.89]Try and lock it.
[267:28.66]Another rock monster.
[267:38.55]You've had that feeling for about four hours now.
[267:40.29]Well, I mean, it's gotta be getting close, right?
[268:01.03]I'm gonna say to the right, maybe.
[268:02.59]I don't think so.
[268:08.92]I guess I was wrong.
[268:09.96]Bug on me.
[268:11.48]Nope, just a hair.
[268:12.10]That was a one-hit kill.
[268:27.97]Whoa.
[268:29.13]I didn't even see him.
[268:36.89]I'm going to come crashing down on this guy.
[268:38.47]Watch this one.
[268:43.57]I did it.
[268:43.85]I crashed him.
[268:57.75]Alrighty.
[269:00.99]There was blood on the box.
[269:02.07]You're right.
[269:03.59]You are right.
[269:16.26]What purpose does this serve?
[269:20.11]Ooh.
[269:21.07]That sort of serves a purpose, right?
[269:22.81]If I jump off this...
[269:30.41]Kind of like that.
[269:33.99]Ah, really?
[269:35.71]I guess it doesn't matter anyways.
[269:36.81]I could just get up here, can't I?
[269:39.04]What's the point of that?
[269:40.74]It really didn't seem like one.
[269:43.40]No, there isn't.
[269:47.38]Let's just keep going.
[269:53.88]Huh.
[269:56.55]Interesting.
[270:12.64]Trying to see what's up there.
[270:13.96]I'm just going to have to go for it.
[270:25.48]RIT.
[270:29.11]No, that's just me falling to my death.
[270:41.06]Warhorn, again.
[270:50.87]Frozen locket.
[270:53.55]Um... shit.
[271:07.89]I just didn't know what was even below me.
[271:09.33]I'm back here again.
[271:24.30]Just like... I don't have any words for how dumb I think this is.
[271:38.13]I just don't have any words for it.
[271:40.71]No, I need to go that way.
[271:49.87]It's like in a game where you get these permanent... Permanent penalties for dying.
[271:54.70]And needing to, like, parkour around like this.
[271:58.34]And they're like, fuck you.
[271:59.42]You know what I'm saying?
[272:01.82]He just went in.
[272:02.40]He just went in the hole.
[272:05.16]I'm gonna see, am I gonna run into him?
[272:21.37]So, like, Dark Souls?
[272:22.47]Yeah, but, like, the fact that I have to, like, parkour around... sucks.
[272:34.73]One dollar per swear word?
[272:49.28]I haven't even found the sanctuary here.
[272:54.00]Who knows where that ungodly thing could be.
[272:56.31]I guess I can just keep going this way.
[273:15.76]Trying to see if there's anything else I can do besides the parkour game over here.
[273:19.04]How do I get up there?
[273:49.30]Jump from here to there.
[273:50.34]I guess.
[273:53.32]This is where I came from.
[274:02.13]Kinda, uh, yeah.
[274:11.50]Ooh, whoa!
[274:11.84]I didn't have another jump.
[274:14.18]I thought I had a second one.
[274:15.08]I didn't land on the ground, apparently.
[274:16.18]That was weird.
[274:22.42]I want to go back up.
[274:23.12]I don't want to stay down here.
[274:24.00]I wanted to go up to the top.
[274:33.47]I think I might have screwed myself.
[274:34.55]Yeah, I definitely did.
[274:38.27]I need to go all the way back and around.
[274:49.88]Come on, will you please?
[274:53.67]I think I did actually screw myself, I think.
[274:57.86]Yeah, I'm in trouble here.
[274:58.80]I'm just going to have to go back down.
[275:03.24]I can't touch this wall.
[275:04.84]I'm just clipping through this.
[275:05.80]Are you kidding me?
[275:20.90]Remember this guy?
[275:31.58]This is what happened before.
[275:32.60]I got, like, fucking screwed over here.
[275:34.80]It's down this way.
[275:48.39]At least I want to get my souls back.
[275:50.35]Or my shalt.
[275:59.17]Okay.
[276:01.38]So how do I reliably get over here?
[276:07.08]I couldn't even see what was below.
[276:08.24]Because what I tried to do is get... I'm going to have to just fall?
[276:13.81]Straight down?
[276:14.29]Because wasn't there a platform right there?
[276:15.61]Wish I could see like a centimeter below.
[276:27.51]Drop down and dash maybe?
[276:29.57]That's going to be really risky.
[276:33.78]I'm not even sure I'd make that jump either, because if you're falling... No, see?
[276:38.96]See what I'm talking about?
[276:42.00]Falling and dashing, you don't go anywhere.
[276:43.94]You go like an inch in front of you, apparently, I guess.
[276:52.72]I don't think... Riding down the wall, you end up just falling if you stick on it for too long.
[277:04.80]Yeah.
[277:05.58]So, if you're falling, like, do you see how far I'm jumping just by being, like, jumping in the air?
[277:10.66]When you fall, you go, you go, like, this far.
[277:21.73]So, that was, that was cool, I guess.
[277:24.57]Nice to already watch.
[277:27.19]So, okay, so, I don't know, I don't know if I'm crazy or not, but, like, how come I can dash when I fall from here?
[277:36.66]Like, what was... Is it because I'm falling too far?
[277:39.04]Because I did not go like that when I fell.
[277:44.97]You know what I mean?
[277:45.43]Like, I went like that.
[277:46.95]I literally went like this far with the dash when I fell that other time.
[277:50.01]Like, I didn't go that far.
[277:54.79]I just, like, sunk like a fucking rock.
[278:11.00]Did I just... I went the wrong way.
[278:14.38]I'm too busy trying to figure out what... Please get the fuck off me!
[278:19.30]Get away from me!
[278:21.14]I'm poisoned.
[278:21.78]It's definitely because I'm falling too fast, yeah.
[278:25.32]I would say, for sure.
[278:27.14]Yeah, I can see.
[278:28.94]I want to just make sure I test my hypothesis here.
[278:31.62]Because... Let's see.
[278:39.01]Yeah, see?
[278:40.65]You just kind of don't move anywhere if you're going too far.
[278:43.89]Alright, which one?
[278:49.05]I like don't even like it's in down here.
[278:55.22]Just trying not to get pounced like that.
[278:59.64]I'm probably gonna get like this poison off me.
[279:17.50]Whoops Do I have a shower buddy like a friend that showers with me Yeah, I don't I'm gonna get the salt and then I might just Try to go the other way
[280:02.15]This is where I wanted to go.
[280:04.25]Well, wait a second.
[280:07.45]Nope, nothing up there.
[280:10.53]Well, here is the sanctuary.
[280:14.78]Just need to get my souls back.
[280:28.49]It's on the other side of this door.
[280:32.53]This looks like a new area.
[280:39.47]Just want to take a peek.
[280:53.63]Where is this gonna lead?
[280:59.77]I can open whatever this is.
[281:01.01]The Debo!
[281:03.85]What's going on, Debo?
[281:05.56]Thanks for stopping.
[281:08.08]Welcome.
[281:08.26]There's another sanctuary right here.
[281:11.82]No, I'm not going to do that.
[281:31.85]It's all connected.
[281:44.86]Thank you to all the people that have subscribed so far tonight.
[281:47.54]And resubbed.
[281:50.48]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[281:54.44]What was over here?
[281:55.46]That.
[281:55.93]Okay.
[281:57.29]Go get my salts and then...
[282:01.59]attempt this again for, like, the third time.
[282:03.87]Do I still play Binding of Isaac?
[282:13.38]Um, occasionally.
[282:14.62]Not really, though.
[282:16.42]I got my fill of it.
[282:20.60]After, uh, Wrath of the Lamb, and then Rebirth, and then Afterbirth, it was a lot.
[282:26.60]There was a lot of Binding of Isaac over the last couple of years.
[282:32.22]But I had a shitload of fun on the game.
[282:33.84]It's a great game.
[282:37.14]Nothing up there.
[282:40.98]What about the people that are watching?
[282:42.32]Anybody that's watching.
[282:44.44]To everybody that's watching right now.
[282:47.48]Or subscribers.
[282:48.60]Or resubs.
[282:51.46]Yeah.
[282:52.26]Fuck yeah.
[282:52.62]Thanks.
[282:53.42]Thanks for sticking around and watching me hate this part of the game.
[282:58.58]And get upset at things.
[283:00.26]And yell and do a tantrum.
[283:12.89]Isn't there another, like... Ooh, hold on.
[283:18.02]They've got another game coming out, don't they?
[283:21.22]That's in The Binding of Isaac universe.
[283:26.26]That was bad.
[283:28.48]Almost made... That was almost a disaster.
[283:32.10]Like the poo-poo guy, whatever it is.
[283:33.55]The Death to Smoochie.
[283:35.47]What's the name of the game?
[283:49.06]I might just ring the bell and level up.
[283:55.27]Because I just... If I die down here again, I just need to see exactly what I can cling onto.
[284:03.57]This seems pretty difficult.
[284:14.24]What do you think?
[284:14.95]Ring the bell or should I just go for it again and see where I can get to?
[284:17.47]50,000 salt is a lot, but... If they're always going to be right on this ledge, it's not like a big deal.
[284:29.98]You're going to regret it.
[284:41.55]You just need to short hop fast fall into a jump cancelled wavedash to B reverse down air jump back into the shit spark.
[284:48.79]Shine spark.
[284:49.63]It can't be any easier.
[284:55.74]Is there anything else over here?
[284:58.56]Before I make a stupid leap of faith, is there something else here I can do?
[285:08.87]Just for curiosity's sake.
[285:21.65]I mean, like, that's a thing I can... Can I even get there, though?
[285:24.75]Yep.
[285:37.30]Oh, bingo.
[285:38.64]Bingo.
[285:40.42]Here's a skip.
[285:41.40]This is the sanctuary right here.
[285:45.50]Oh, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful, wonderful.
[285:54.39]Thank God.
[285:55.01]Okay.
[286:12.14]I mean, I guess we're going up here to get the two-handed class 5 weapons, but I haven't even seen one yet.
[286:19.79]Just keep doing it.
[286:20.95]Keep going up this track.
[286:23.03]Because this is class 4.
[286:24.43]Great hammers and great axes.
[286:31.27]I'm just going to do that.
[286:33.70]I still don't have enough to level up.
[286:36.26]I'm like 40.
[286:36.56]I'm 60 salt away from leveling up.
[286:41.58]I have bags I can smash.
[287:02.63]Alright.
[287:04.39]Now at least I know if I die, it's not a big deal.
[287:06.54]I can just go for it.
[287:11.96]Wait a second.
[287:15.30]Wait just a second.
[287:16.52]Wait just a second.
[287:20.74]Yeah, I went the wrong way.
[287:29.25]Alright.
[287:30.45]Let's die.
[287:31.17]You guys ready to take the leap of faith and die?
[287:35.61]Can't wait.
[287:59.68]I might have had it that first time if I didn't get stuck.
[288:04.70]It's alright, we're right here.
[288:05.52]We're not going to worry about anything.
[288:08.14]We could talk about it some more.
[288:21.04]Or we could just do it.
[288:28.85]Yeah, we could talk about it.
[288:40.50]Lord's orders.
[288:44.24]What else you got for me in here?
[288:45.31]There's a ledge over there I might be able to get up to.
[288:53.77]Maybe...
[289:02.32]Guess not yet.
[289:08.88]That look like the shit to you guys?
[289:12.15]Doesn't that kind of look like the thing I can land on?
[289:14.11]I guess it wasn't.
[289:37.04]It looked kind of like it could have been.
[289:46.79]Oh, shit.
[289:47.13]That's not what I wanted to do.
[289:50.81]Don't use us to justify your actions.
[289:54.33]I'm not.
[289:54.87]It kind of looked like it could have been that thing, but that's not.
[289:57.74]I just kind of fucked it up, but whatever.
[290:00.22]Whatever.
[290:14.31]Oh, fuck.
[290:15.07]That hurts.
[290:18.63]Are you serious?
[290:19.75]Whatever.
[290:20.21]I don't even care.
[290:20.91]I had no souls anyways.
[290:26.04]Now we're just going kind of backwards again to another area, which I don't know where I'm going.
[290:32.34]More stupid jumps that I have to make.
[290:39.03]Okay, well, I'm not dead.
[290:40.05]I'm alive, and I'm down here.
[290:41.51]I don't know where this is.
[290:46.48]Why is this like this?
[290:48.76]Fucking god temple.
[291:13.07]Can I go back to the part of the game where I fight enemies?
[291:15.71]Can I go back to that part?
[291:19.99]Can we do that part again?
[291:37.32]Shit, it's a boss.
[291:47.65]First try.
[291:50.64]Criken dragon scoochie.
[291:52.74]First try.
[291:53.12]We're gonna do it first try.
[291:54.06]Have to do it first try.
[292:01.94]That looks like Arcane.
[292:09.73]I'm dead.
[292:32.20]Well, he looks like he does arcane and electricity.
[292:34.92]So maybe I should put some of that on.
[292:37.60]What do I have right now?
[292:38.52]Lightning.
[292:38.96]Arcane.
[292:41.60]Does it even have... Yeah, it does have good arcane.
[292:55.41]Lightning.
[292:56.11]Arcane.
[292:58.37]Arcane.
[293:06.47]Okay, I'm gonna put on Sorcerer's Luigi.
[293:28.72]Attack power...
[293:32.24]What does this one do?
[293:32.97]Uh, I'll put on the... Do I have the... Where is it?
[293:42.63]The lightning ring.
[293:45.09]Well.
[293:47.32]Um.
[293:47.48]Okay.
[293:49.08]Okay.
[293:58.82]I wonder if there's a faster way to get to him, or do I have to do this every time?
[294:01.86]I hope I don't have to do it.
[294:02.83]I just kind of got lost over there.
[294:04.15]Unfortunately.
[294:08.47]I'm actually not going to go the other way.
[294:10.49]I'm not going to go towards the dragon right now.
[294:12.19]There's another way to go down here.
[294:14.55]If I go down this way... I don't know if I can make this one up, but I'm going to give it a try.
[294:32.88]I have no idea what this is bringing me.
[294:44.43]I don't know.
[294:45.59]I guess... I can see a candle.
[295:01.57]Left.
[295:09.30]I don't know.
[295:15.06]Where are you taking me?
[295:17.10]Where are you taking me?
[295:25.02]Oh, come on.
[295:28.06]I don't know how much longer I can take this.
[295:35.25]I don't know how much longer I can take FALL the game.
[295:37.36]You know what I mean?
[295:49.67]Like, I don't know how much longer I can FALL the game.
[296:06.59]Oh shit, the ground is shaking.
[296:08.51]It really is.
[296:09.07]I'm not going that way.
[296:21.45]Not that way either.
[296:22.23]Let's go this way.
[296:28.99]I'm not going to play guess which way you should fall the video game.
[296:33.58]I'm not doing that right now.
[296:47.61]I thought he was going to jump over me.
[296:51.19]Guess not.
[296:58.48]Whatever, I'll just jump around here.
[297:00.88]Stone Shell Sword.
[297:03.64]I think that's a co-op item?
[297:13.06]God I'm dead.
[297:16.22]It's so fucking close.
[297:17.54]How am I still alive?
[297:27.93]See the fight the dragon or not fight the dragon
[297:51.75]I don't think so I don't think so Let's try the dragon again
[298:32.51]Wow, that probably does a lot.
[298:34.01]I would be surprised if it didn't kill me.
[298:35.55]Did I really get hit by that?
[298:48.16]Damn.
[298:53.51]Oh, he shoots straight down.
[298:54.69]I thought he was going to arc it.
[298:56.29]I'm having trouble going through him.
[299:02.24]I can't dodge through him right now.
[299:07.91]Jeez.
[299:15.71]And I'm wounded.
[299:17.84]Almost half my health is gone at this point.
[299:35.81]Damn it.
[299:37.29]I'm dead here.
[299:50.86]I'm dead here.
[299:51.36]I'm dead here.
[299:53.06]I keep saying that, but I'm not dead somehow.
[299:59.77]Um, yeah.
[300:00.79]It's just... The holy damage was working a lot, but I might have to... Do you see how you get stuck inside of them?
[300:09.49]I'm gonna have to put the wounding... Look at my health right now.
[300:15.28]The wounding ring definitely is gonna have to go on.
[300:18.32]Because I have, like, 40% HP.
[300:19.84]Yeah.
[300:28.57]I didn't even know those were traps.
[300:30.29]This is the second time I've ever fought the boss.
[300:35.37]I just thought he shot electricity at you.
[300:36.81]Alright, where is the holy light stuff?
[300:44.94]I know I have quite a few of them.
[300:47.10]Yes, I do.
[300:53.42]I can probably do it.
[300:54.76]But I kind of...
[301:01.55]You have to do two rolls to get through him.
[301:06.93]I'm just going to have to go for a burn.
[301:08.29]I'm just going to have to do just Blessed Page and just strike the shit out of him.
[301:12.22]You know what I mean?
[301:14.80]That's what I'm going to do.
[301:23.84]Chef with the dagger?
[301:24.60]I could do that.
[301:28.57]Quit this lousy game?
[301:29.87]No, I'm so close.
[301:32.10]It's not a lousy game.
[301:34.34]It's fun.
[301:44.49]What was the correct way to go?
[301:52.99]It's over here.
[302:10.84]Okay.
[302:11.74]What, I got him to 50% last time?
[302:19.14]Let's go for 20.
[302:20.28]No, let's go for a kill.
[302:22.86]I'm going to try to burn him.
[302:24.62]He just needs to get burnt.
[302:40.84]Oh, I hate getting stuck inside of him.
[302:44.02]Thank you for jumping.
[302:44.80]Shit.
[302:50.30]For a second, I thought that was his trident move.
[302:52.82]I still got hit by it.
[303:05.41]I'm so far away.
[303:11.57]The tracking on that thing is disgusting.
[303:19.09]It's just like this.
[303:19.87]It's exactly where you're standing.
[303:38.80]Back to bed.
[303:43.76]Thankfully I can get back there pretty reliably at this point.
[303:46.14]I mean, I could take off, like, all my pants.
[304:00.91]I could take my pants off.
[304:03.37]Let me see.
[304:09.89]We could go pantsless.
[304:10.99]I just want to see how much, if I can keep on this and take the rest of it off.
[304:19.24]Will I always fat roll?
[304:21.40]Always?
[304:21.76]Let's see what happens if I take this off.
[304:30.22]Yeah, unfortunately.
[304:33.31]But that thing is the only reason why I'm staying alive.
[304:46.21]It's gonna have to stay on
[305:11.03]I'm gonna take out my rings too.
[305:12.37]Attack power.
[305:18.49]Lightning damage.
[305:20.43]Roll speed.
[305:24.02]What else do I have?
[305:30.06]Hmm.
[305:34.72]There it is.
[305:36.58]The wounding ring.
[305:38.08]Because he was wounding the shit out of me.
[305:55.95]It's like Club Penguin.
[305:58.33]Club Penguin.
[306:12.46]Oh.
[306:15.98]I thought it was the electrical ball.
[306:18.62]But nope.
[306:19.42]It was the other move that looks exactly the same.
[306:24.24]Damn it.
[306:24.96]Is this the last boss?
[306:27.90]Or is this, like, the second to last boss?
[306:29.91]Like, or what?
[306:38.13]That was so... That was so fast.
[306:42.57]He just... He got caught dead.
[306:46.62]I thought it was the electrical move.
[306:48.52]Nope.
[306:49.08]It wasn't.
[306:50.38]It wasn't.
[306:51.08]It wasn't.
[306:51.54]It wasn't.
[306:51.94]It wasn't.
[306:52.38]It wasn't.
[306:55.51]Alright, I'm gonna give this like two or three more attempts, and then I'm gonna stop streaming.
[306:59.67]Because I've been streaming for a while.
[307:04.21]I've been streaming for a while.
[307:15.38]Is Club Penguin still a thing?
[307:16.84]Is that like, the server's still online?
[307:19.80]Can you still play Club Penguin?
[307:28.80]I haven't heard that name in a long time.
[307:44.72]God.
[307:46.10]He's doing it again.
[307:46.74]No, he's not.
[308:14.60]Oh, I thought it was the other move.
[308:17.88]Oh, that happens so fast.
[308:23.30]Where is he?
[308:23.58]He's like hiding in the corner.
[308:46.82]Jump.
[308:49.36]Jump.
[309:03.29]No, no.
[309:04.93]I was even in the air.
[309:06.63]No.
[309:07.15]Complaint.
[309:07.55]Complaint number 50,000.
[309:08.13]Complaint.
[309:18.04]I feel like that is just such a huge orb.
[309:20.28]It's too big.
[309:20.84]Oh, fucking god.
[309:31.25]God damn it, it does so much damage.
[309:33.59]If you just tie... Alright, last attempt.
[309:40.66]Ah, the French Champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[309:50.51]I love donuts, number three.
[309:51.89]Thanks, 37.
[309:52.39]Welcome back.
[309:58.95]I have so much lightning resist on, too.
[310:04.89]You know what?
[310:06.77]It's not even... I'm doing as much lightning as possible.
[310:09.55]Because I can avoid the arcane.
[310:11.37]The arcane is easy to avoid at this point because I know where it's coming from.
[310:16.52]But that lightning strike, if you get touched with it once, it just screws you up and you have to keep dodging.
[310:32.13]Is this arcane?
[310:32.97]No, that's lightning.
[310:37.01]There's no arcane?
[310:37.71]He does, like, doesn't he do the giant purple breath?
[310:39.55]Isn't that arcane?
[310:46.99]I'm going to give it one more attempt.
[310:48.47]I don't expect to beat him at this point right now.
[311:07.42]But I will give it one more attempt.
[311:10.35]If this is in fact the second to last boss of the game, I might as well give it one more try before I
[311:17.97]Take a load off.
[311:18.61]Did I get it off?
[311:43.75]I did.
[311:50.59]That's so hard to even dodge the first one.
[312:03.94]No, I'm screwed here.
[312:10.60]I just barely didn't even get hit by it, too.
[312:26.92]Fucking tracking on that thing sucks.
[312:29.30]Jump over me, please.
[312:30.94]No!
[312:32.48]Don't do it!
[312:45.15]Finally.
[312:51.77]Like, isn't that arcane?
[312:52.61]That looks like it's arcane.
[312:56.49]Jump.
[312:57.67]Come on, you know you want to jump.
[313:20.03]Shit.
[313:20.15]Shit.
[313:20.31]It's really just the pitchfork lightning.
[313:23.39]It gets me.
[313:29.89]He didn't do it over here Sprig war Sprig war of a man.
[313:44.74]Thanks for seven I'm gonna top myself off.
[313:51.52]I'm gonna try to destroy him.
[313:52.72]I'll try I
[314:10.39]Wrong thing that's fire.
[314:11.76]That's what I wanted top off That's what I wanted to the jump
[314:35.68]In my pants.
[314:37.26]There's a fuck party in my pants.
[314:52.74]Yes!
[314:57.58]I'm done.
[314:58.38]I'm done streaming.
[314:59.18]I'm done.
[315:11.44]See, that guy told me to destroy him.
[315:12.66]I had to do it.
[315:14.14]I couldn't let that guy down.
[315:18.30]Is this learning the tactics and strategies and complaint?
[315:21.22]Here's how this works.
[315:23.06]All games like this, Dark Souls, Dark Souls 2, Bloodborne, I'm sure Dark Souls 3 is like it as well.
[315:30.82]Here's the stages of grief when it comes to these games.
[315:34.86]So, stage one is anger, obviously, right?
[315:38.15]You get very upset.
[315:39.54]What does that move do?
[315:40.74]That move is fucking so broken.
[315:42.20]This game sucks.
[315:43.70]You die like three or four times in a row.
[315:46.24]And then you realize that the thing that you're complaining about, acceptance.
[315:49.06]Stage two, acceptance.
[315:51.20]You accept what it is.
[315:53.22]You kind of let it do its thing.
[315:55.00]You figure out what it is.
[315:55.92]And stage three is you put them in denial.
[316:03.06]That's the three stage program.
[316:04.52]Because they're going to be in denial.
[316:07.57]God is ahead.
[316:08.20]Try killing it.
[316:11.04]Haunting inward.
[316:11.84]Okay, well.
[316:15.08]Still palace.
[316:22.05]I'm not at the last boss right now, am I?
[316:26.39]One right after the... Is that what's going to happen here?
[316:29.03]Or is there a sanctuary?
[316:35.68]It's a chest.
[316:40.24]King's Orders.
[316:45.74]Well, he went into black and white now.
[316:47.08]This is odd.
[316:50.48]We have to fight God?
[316:52.84]I'm kind of just overthinking things at this point.
[317:00.89]But I do want a Sanctuary.
[317:05.33]Which, hopefully, this is one right here.
[317:09.39]It is not.
[317:12.39]Calling horn.
[317:13.21]There we are!
[317:22.47]First try and the last boss.
[317:23.57]We'll give it one try.
[317:25.23]If the boss really is, like, right here.
[317:34.16]But I have a feeling there's at least somewhat of a level left.
[317:41.74]Somewhat.
[317:44.43]Shit is upside down.
[317:45.45]Can't go that way.
[317:53.23]Music's getting louder.
[318:09.84]How spooky.
[318:10.40]How eerie.
[318:14.19]chest of salt.
[318:15.23]Is that the ground right there?
[318:19.59]Kind of looks like it, right?
[318:24.71]I don't want to take a chance.
[318:25.93]Is there anything else over here to grab or look at?
[318:27.81]I don't think so.
[318:34.88]I wish I could look down further.
[318:35.94]Did I miss anything?
[318:48.97]We're there.
[318:51.68]Uh... Isn't that where I came from?
[318:55.94]Yeah, it is.
[319:10.41]Guess we're just gonna keep... Gotta have to go down there.
[319:13.47]Gotta have to go down.
[319:14.17]You know what I'm saying?
[319:17.55]Gotta have to go down there.
[319:18.22]You know what I'm saying?
[319:26.65]Yeah, gotta have to go down.
[319:32.87]But, I mean... The candles lead you down?
[319:36.14]Are you talking about, like, these three-pronged candles?
[319:39.50]Or do you mean, like, the candles that are on the wall over here?
[319:44.54]Because I don't see any way to drop down here.
[319:48.54]I'm going for it.
[319:49.27]Fuck it.
[319:49.53]Who cares?
[319:49.85]Okay.
[319:52.31]That's that way.
[320:05.38]nothing see for doors that's better no that's a little bit better advance and get good okay the god awaits salt and sanctuary and here try up secret spell
[320:35.54]Don't care.
[320:38.36]Here we go.
[320:39.84]I'm going to beat him.
[320:40.96]First attempt.
[320:41.67]Final boss.
[320:43.97]The nameless god.
[320:49.25]How do you like this one?
[320:50.55]First try.
[321:04.67]What is this scream?
[321:06.17]What the fuck was that?
[321:07.83]Okay, I gotta be careful here.
[321:28.12]Just block!
[321:36.58]I can beat him.
[321:37.56]He's fucking easy.
[321:39.52]This guy is a piece of cake.
[321:43.45]I brought him down to 50% HP.
[321:46.51]I'm going to destroy this guy.
[321:48.87]Watch me.
[321:50.61]I'm beating this game right now.
[321:57.09]Wait, am I going the right way?
[321:57.87]Am I going backwards here?
[322:02.13]No.
[322:05.79]I'm gonna kill this guy right now.
[322:06.88]Like, seriously.
[322:07.74]That, like, the Criken dragon was ten times harder than this guy's gonna be.
[322:18.78]Just gotta watch out for his scream lightning.
[322:27.67]That's really the only threat this guy poses.
[322:33.83]Oh, look out for his scream lightning.
[322:42.97]I'm going to... That's so dumb.
[322:45.81]Of course, fall the game.
[322:47.09]Let's go, buddy.
[322:53.71]Let's do it.
[322:54.17]I think I'm Scream Lightning already.
[322:56.93]Okay, I don't know.
[323:00.05]I'm not sure how you don't get hit by that.
[323:01.69]Okay, I'm getting really greedy here.
[323:09.97]What is this move?
[323:10.91]He didn't do that before.
[323:11.89]Why does he have a new move set?
[323:20.71]Okay, I figured it out.
[323:23.19]Easiest boss in like the whole game.
[323:24.97]Look at how easy this dude is.
[323:27.23]Oh, did you just lose?
[323:28.47]I just beat the game.
[323:31.21]Beat ya.
[323:33.15]That's how you win.
[323:35.47]One.
[323:36.27]Game over.
[323:38.24]I'll take the 75,000 salt.
[323:49.73]Okay.
[323:52.85]This is where I put the thing on the pedestal and it says, Congratulations!
[323:56.37]You did it!
[323:57.29]Am I being born?
[324:12.30]You were the sperm all along.
[324:23.09]fall of the game.
[324:23.81]Where's my weapon?
[324:26.97]Did I win?
[324:31.67]I escaped the sanctuary.
[324:32.93]I did it.
[324:38.46]Yeah, I did it.
[324:47.26]Curse no longer gasping breath.
[324:59.48]I won.
[325:08.93]Surprise shark boss?
[325:12.09]That was a fun game.
[325:14.32]That was absolutely, that was worth the price of admission for sure.
[325:18.31]You guys have to remember, I had a monster... I leveled up a bunch and I had a monster two-hander.
[325:22.91]With lightning damage.
[325:24.89]I mean, I hit the last boss in the game like eight times and he died.
[325:29.41]But, you know.
[325:36.84]That's why you go through and do New Game Plus.
[325:45.98]Yeah, now that was fun.
[325:57.29]For all my, uh... For all my saltiness, if you could say, you know.
[326:02.81]That was a very enjoyable game.
[326:06.77]Less than 20 bucks.
[326:09.07]How long did it take to beat the whole game?
[326:10.85]From start to finish?
[326:12.01]And there's probably at least, like, two or three side areas I didn't do.
[326:16.71]Yeah, remember the unicorn area?
[326:19.37]I didn't go down the unicorn area.
[326:22.63]Let me see.
[326:23.29]I'm curious.
[326:25.51]15 hours.
[326:26.60]Just to casually, blindly play through the game.
[326:29.76]You could have shaved probably like maybe 2 hours off of that.
[326:32.54]Because I was kind of dicking around for some of it.
[326:35.38]But, yeah.
[326:36.34]That's fun.
[326:41.50]New game plus.
[326:44.31]I do want to just very quickly here.
[326:49.11]I want to see...
[326:52.18]Oh, no, I want it to be... Oh, I'm using my keyboard that doesn't exist.
[327:01.27]Just for curiosity's sake.
[327:05.31]Because we have a little bit here.
[327:11.88]I don't care.
[327:24.88]So that means... So you do actually just get aimable spells, huh?
[327:31.62]Make cost.
[327:33.54]That's cool.
[327:34.54]You can play it as like a legit mage from the very beginning of the game.
[327:37.02]It's time for a Tim run.
[327:45.43]Alright guys, welcome.
[327:46.59]We're doing a Tim run.
[327:48.79]I like know where to go now.
[327:56.40]Ah, the French champagne has always been celebrated for its excellence.
[328:04.08]Hey, Reidbot.
[328:05.06]Thanks for the resub.
[328:05.72]I need to sit here and do this.
[328:21.95]Mage OP.
[328:22.81]Mage OP.
[328:34.59]Uh-oh, out of juice.
[328:36.49]Out of juice.
[328:37.51]Why am I out of juice?
[328:42.14]He really is out of juice.
[328:50.68]Why am I out of juice?
[328:56.31]Please don't kill me.
[328:56.85]Please don't kill me!
[329:03.65]Oh, look at where you ended up.
[329:07.37]Huh?
[329:10.86]What the fuck is this?
[329:13.98]What is this?
[329:14.58]What is Cthulhu doing here?
[329:19.94]Did that happen in the other game?
[329:21.13]Hold on.
[329:30.41]This is really important.
[329:34.21]Get me out of here.
[329:34.69]I don't care about Tim right now.
[329:38.95]I need to exit the game.
[329:50.56]No, I didn't even do... I died to one of the regular enemies, I think, down there.
[329:55.15]I didn't get that far.
[329:59.30]Hold on.
[330:00.80]We're gonna go kill that motherfucker right now on New Game Plus.
[330:05.48]Aww.
[330:08.79]Can I go back in the water?
[330:09.69]Oh well.
[330:18.32]Well, whatever.
[330:20.58]Never mind.
[330:29.09]Oh, I beat it.
[330:29.59]Salt and Sanctuary.
[330:30.73]There it is.
[330:33.37]I would put that on the... Okay, you either recommend or not recommend.
[330:41.21]Recommend.
[330:44.50]It'll tide you over in the meantime between this and Dark Souls 3 if you're into this kind of thing.
[330:48.56]Yeah, recommend.
[330:52.10]Recommend.
[331:03.96]Yeah, fire good, not bad.
[331:07.29]I'm not doing a club penguin stream.
[331:14.17]Club penguin.
[331:16.77]What would I even do?
[331:17.79]I don't even know.
[331:31.57]It seems like there's a lot of options.
[331:34.38]And strangely enough, you probably, like, that was my first playthrough, right?
[331:41.12]Did you see how much stuff I didn't get?
[331:44.86]Especially in the skill tree.
[331:46.95]There was still a pretty long way to go before I got to, like, stage five great hammers on that side.
[331:54.66]So I'm going to assume the game is built around doing it multiple times and finding, I didn't find any like stage five.
[332:01.72]Maybe that's only a new game plus for class five weapons.
[332:06.05]Did I, I think the highest thing I got was like a class three.
[332:16.36]Whatever.
[332:17.96]I've been streaming for nearly six hours now, so I'm probably going to get some food and cut up a video.
[332:25.49]Not from this, but... Thank you everyone for coming out.
[332:30.71]Thanks for joining me.
[332:34.31]Much love.
[332:35.45]Thanks to all the people watching.
[332:36.31]Thanks to all the new subs, all the old subs.
[332:38.97]And in between, I'm going to get some food.
[332:46.55]I'm bumping into stuff.
[332:51.17]Do an eating stream?
[332:52.31]No.
[332:54.82]All these things.
[332:55.58]I was actually going to do a cooking stream.
[332:58.10]Figured it'd be fun.
[332:59.12]Set up like a whole ordeal.
[333:02.41]Just burn the shit out of a bunch of food and pretend like I know what I'm doing.
[333:07.31]It was a thought I had.
[333:11.00]But yeah, take it easy, guys.
[333:13.17]Much love.
[333:13.77]Goodbye.
[333:14.13]Good night.
[333:14.63]Have a good rest of your day or night.
[333:16.19]Wherever it is.
[333:16.94]If it's fucking 2 o'clock in the afternoon, cool.
[333:18.84]If it's 8 o'clock at night, good night.
[333:22.01]Bye, bye, bye.
