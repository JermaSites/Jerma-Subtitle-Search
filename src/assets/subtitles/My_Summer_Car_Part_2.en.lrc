[07:22.24]Okay, let's go back to the game.
[07:24.94]My hair looks black?
[07:27.41]My hair is not black.
[07:28.67]It's probably the lighting.
[07:29.39]5, 10 is... Oh, wait.
[07:31.99]We didn't look at the present.
[07:34.95]I've been live for 7 minutes and I got $700 in 7 minutes.
[07:40.78]My lord.
[07:43.06]You guys are fucking spoiling me.
[07:44.64]Alright.
[07:44.88]Wherefore, Merry Christmas.
[07:46.32]I don't think I can pick it up.
[07:47.98]No.
[07:48.50]Let's just go.
[07:49.06]Oh, wait.
[07:49.52]I gotta get in the car in the rain.
[07:52.44]Definitely gotta get in the car in the rain.
[08:00.30]Uh, how do I even get out of here?
[08:01.18]I think I go this way.
[08:04.68]No, this is a brick wall.
[08:05.84]Okay.
[08:07.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[08:07.82]Okay.
[08:10.86]Okay.
[08:13.74]There we are.
[08:14.46]There we are.
[08:14.96]There's my car.
[08:18.12]There's my car.
[08:19.12]Alright, let's just go drive in the rain.
[08:23.68]I want to go to one of the stores.
[08:24.88]Get in there.
[08:25.66]What the hell?
[08:29.33]Why can I not get in the fucking car?
[08:33.15]Have I already forgotten how to play this game?
[08:34.65]It's been like a day.
[08:38.99]Okay.
[08:39.39]Alright.
[08:39.77]There we go.
[08:40.87]Close the door.
[08:44.08]Restart the stream.
[08:45.54]Because... Wait.
[08:48.32]With a present?
[08:51.76]Thank you MooMeansMoo for the 15 bucks.
[08:53.30]Hi Dermot.
[08:53.68]I have some of my measly Canadian Monopoly money.
[08:57.70]Love you.
[08:58.04]Long time.
[08:58.62]Keep up the awesome.
[08:59.42]Well, thanks, dude.
[09:00.62]Actually, no.
[09:02.02]I don't want to be in trouble.
[09:02.94]Actually, good call.
[09:03.84]Good call.
[09:06.90]I'm going to hydroplane.
[09:08.08]Yeah.
[09:09.14]I want to get the gas.
[09:10.72]Gas and beer are really important.
[09:12.84]Those things you can't leave behind.
[09:13.76]Here's the gas tank.
[09:19.66]There it is.
[09:20.61]Gas tank.
[09:24.05]Somebody just gave money.
[09:28.72]I'm going to throw this in the back and we'll see who gave me the cash.
[09:32.22]Who gave me that money money.
[09:35.60]You money men.
[09:37.97]Keep the door open.
[09:42.39]Thought I'd have to crouch to pick up the gas can.
[09:44.27]Am I that stupid?
[09:46.27]Let me get the hot dogs too.
[09:50.21]Eat the hot dogs.
[09:53.91]Throw it in the back of the car.
[09:58.31]Alright, I'm ready.
[10:01.98]I'm ready.
[10:02.48]They definitely changed the garage door.
[10:05.90]Before I go, I do want to say one thing.
[10:07.40]I'm going to make sure I say it.
[10:11.36]I am sorry that I like, I'm not, I have not been able to keep up with subs for like a long time now.
[10:19.18]I'm just so dumb.
[10:20.22]Like, I keep hearing the notification and I'm just like, but there's this thing going on on the screen.
[10:24.02]I can't, thanks Tinkle Surprise.
[10:25.88]Like, just know I fucking love you if you sub.
[10:29.07]I'm so dumb I can't keep up with it.
[10:32.41]Sometimes I try.
[10:34.21]But I like to focus on what's happening on the screen.
[10:36.59]So I'm so sorry if I'm missing your sub.
[10:39.05]I don't intend to.
[10:40.79]Or your bits or whatever, you know.
[10:42.41]You guys know.
[10:45.02]Apology not accepted.
[10:48.54]Shit!
[10:50.44]Alright, well, facecam's going off.
[10:51.80]Fuck the facecam.
[10:52.66]I'm just gonna play the game.
[10:55.85]And we're just going to go.
[10:57.13]But, I love you guys.
[10:59.71]Do I have a candle lit?
[11:00.65]Yeah, there's a candle back there.
[11:02.63]Surprised you saw that.
[11:06.63]Let me get in here.
[11:10.15]Did I get in?
[11:12.47]Shoutouts to everybody.
[11:13.37]You guys are all fucking awesome.
[11:16.75]Enter driving mode.
[11:17.53]Alright, let me turn the ignition on.
[11:20.19]I always have such trouble doing this.
[11:28.22]I wonder how to turn the cat.
[11:29.52]Turn on!
[11:32.70]There we go.
[11:34.56]Turn on, car!
[11:38.40]What is going on right now?
[11:39.28]Turn the fuck on.
[11:44.32]F you guys, I'm playing the game.
[11:45.26]That's not what I said.
[11:45.91]I said I don't like being on facecam.
[11:55.29]Alright, now we gotta put it in the right gear.
[11:57.33]Handbrake is off.
[11:58.07]XG.
[11:59.21]First gear.
[12:00.11]Let's go.
[12:01.53]Close the door.
[12:02.71]Do I got my shit in the back?
[12:05.51]I do.
[12:06.11]Alright, let's go.
[12:06.83]We're gonna go on an adventure.
[12:12.27]It's the remix to Ignition?
[12:13.93]This is even worse because it's so hard to even see because it's dark.
[12:18.47]This game is harder than Dark Souls.
[12:30.71]No, but the last time we crashed, and I don't want to crash again.
[12:34.56]Do some errands?
[12:40.50]That's what I'm going to do.
[12:41.62]In the rain.
[12:42.08]I just want to make sure I don't crash.
[12:45.51]That's super important.
[12:48.09]What's the default for lights?
[12:51.69]How do I turn the lights on?
[12:53.41]What?
[12:58.29]I just heard glass break.
[13:01.60]Did you really?
[13:05.24]We're never going to build a car.
[13:06.30]It's never going to happen.
[13:13.08]Me building a car in this game, you might as well.
[13:16.24]If that's what you're waiting for, this is fucking never happening.
[13:23.02]Turn the wipers on?
[13:23.78]I don't even know fucking how to do that.
[13:25.80]And that'll distract me.
[13:27.78]And I won't get in a crash.
[13:30.80]Speaking of crashes.
[13:32.36]Speaking of crashes.
[13:35.88]Oh, God.
[13:36.72]I'm gonna crash.
[13:38.78]How far do I have to go?
[13:39.82]At least it's not raining behind me.
[13:43.95]Yeah, that's true.
[13:46.23]Put on my seatbelt?
[13:47.09]Nah.
[13:48.23]Not happening.
[13:53.64]Alright, second gear.
[13:55.28]How much gas do I have?
[13:57.09]I actually got a lot.
[13:58.33]I'm good.
[14:02.71]Game crash.
[14:03.27]That would be horrible.
[14:08.07]There's no rear view?
[14:09.10]There's no rear view mirror?
[14:15.70]What do you mean there's no rear view mirror?
[14:23.34]Wait, wait, okay, crossroads, crossroads.
[14:24.96]Alright, I went right last time.
[14:27.90]Let's go left.
[14:28.78]Let's go to Lape.
[14:30.77]Go faster.
[14:31.31]Not in the rain, man.
[14:32.19]I just want to make it to the store.
[14:38.71]Do I even know what I'm doing?
[14:39.83]Uh, no, I don't, actually.
[14:43.45]I have no idea.
[14:48.87]I'm just kind of driving, waiting to find the store so I can go on an errand.
[14:56.07]No looking back now, no.
[14:57.15]At least I have gas.
[15:00.93]Oh!
[15:02.45]Not like that.
[15:03.61]I don't want to fuck that up.
[15:09.69]Get on the road?
[15:10.71]It's hard to drive.
[15:11.64]This game is not easy to drive.
[15:13.76]Pro tip, stay on the road.
[15:24.62]Thanks for the pro tip.
[15:30.43]Here, I'm on the road, see?
[15:34.09]Alright, what is this?
[15:34.53]What is this?
[15:35.27]There's a new- there's a new street here.
[15:36.25]Alright, I see a building that way.
[15:39.77]That's good, I wanna go this way.
[15:42.33]Into the building.
[15:45.00]No, it's like a baseball field!
[15:46.90]Aw, nice, baseball.
[15:48.28]I love baseball!
[15:49.00]Okay, house.
[15:53.90]Are we- is this like DayZ?
[15:55.02]Should I go look for like a shotgun?
[16:01.63]Alright, we're gonna go, like, find the shot... It's like H1Z1.
[16:03.49]We're gonna go find the shotgun in the shed.
[16:08.88]And, like, go get on, like, the top of the leaderboards.
[16:13.38]What is even in here?
[16:16.00]Can I even get it?
[16:16.50]Can I get in here?
[16:23.53]What the fuck is the point of this?
[16:30.17]Can I smash through this?
[16:32.61]Alright, boys and girls, we're smashing through that fucking gate.
[16:37.69]You don't put a door that's locked in, you're not gonna let me get in there.
[16:40.03]Are you shitting me?
[16:41.47]I'm getting in there.
[16:43.87]Hold on, I gotta go in reverse, though.
[16:45.21]Let's go reverse.
[16:52.63]Ram it?
[16:52.93]Yeah, we're ramming through the front.
[16:55.05]I'm gonna get a shitload of speed.
[16:56.29]We're gonna fucking crash through that front door and get the secret you guys didn't even know about.
[17:01.29]You guys didn't even know there was a fucking secret in this game.
[17:04.76]But me, me, as a secret keeper.
[17:08.10]I know.
[17:09.22]Let's see the fucking door.
[17:09.94]Alright, let's do it.
[17:13.21]Right through the front door.
[17:18.59]Alright!
[17:19.35]Give me the secret shotgun!
[17:39.93]Let's go again.
[17:44.69]Are we gonna go again?
[17:47.88]RW4RWWRWQ Good night sweet prince
[18:02.55]Friends music.
[18:04.30]Oh, God.
[18:04.74]Okay, note to self.
[18:06.24]Don't fucking do that shit anymore.
[18:08.64]Do not fuck around in this game like that anymore.
[18:12.12]You knew that was happening?
[18:12.96]I had an idea that it might happen, and I'm not doing that again.
[18:16.10]I thought maybe I could, like, break through.
[18:21.67]What an amazing secret.
[18:28.01]How do I pee?
[18:33.19]I'm just pissing in the sink.
[18:35.27]Wait, what?
[18:37.71]Oh, wow.
[18:38.49]Mom's gonna be real mad about this.
[18:40.27]Alright, let's go.
[18:49.42]Let's go.
[18:49.80]Let's go on another adventure.
[18:54.28]Jeremy, there's a boat at the... There's a boat at the lake.
[18:56.18]You shit me?
[18:56.64]We're going.
[18:58.40]No more fucking dumb I crashed joke.
[19:01.75]We've done that too much.
[19:09.65]You can hear my pee.
[19:10.41]Alright, let's go.
[19:14.52]Run, run, run, run, run.
[19:18.12]Why is it like Minecraft pee?
[19:20.20]I don't know.
[19:23.50]We definitely gotta get in the boat.
[19:24.40]Is the boat down where I was going before?
[19:26.83]If I had kept going?
[19:27.43]I need the gas too, actually.
[19:38.29]Maybe I should try to crash through this.
[19:40.03]Wouldn't that be funny, guys?
[19:40.95]Hey, remember when I crashed?
[19:47.83]Time for the dumb I drowned joke.
[19:50.58]Remember when I fell out of the boat and drowned?
[19:55.26]No, we're not doing any more of those.
[19:56.24]I told you, that was the one and only joke we get to do the whole stream.
[19:59.18]There are no more jokes in this stream, guys.
[20:02.41]Like, I can promise you that there's not going to be a joke...
[20:07.94]Promise.
[20:08.24]You're good to go?
[20:11.21]Good to go.
[20:14.85]Okay, driving mode.
[20:15.83]I do want to see what the lake is, though.
[20:18.93]That would be important to see.
[20:20.13]Alright, turn it on.
[20:24.73]Come on.
[20:30.58]Come on.
[20:32.96]Alright.
[20:33.62]There we go.
[20:36.46]This time, no more jokes.
[20:39.10]I know I say that a lot, but for real though, it takes so long to go anywhere in this game that... We're not doing any more fucking jokes.
[20:45.70]Not again.
[20:51.21]Not from this guy.
[20:56.09]Sit further back in the car?
[20:59.39]Can I do that?
[20:59.87]Should I just go, like, here?
[21:05.87]Like that?
[21:08.19]Oh wow, that is like a little bit better actually.
[21:09.59]Oh, that's kind of like them nerfing in a way though.
[21:13.69]I don't like being able to see the steering wheel being turned without my hands there.
[21:18.30]I gotta put my hands out.
[21:20.00]Can I put my hands out?
[21:24.42]That's not how you put your hands out.
[21:29.00]Alright, honest to god, how the fuck am I driving the car?
[21:33.79]I'm just giving the finger and a ghost is driving.
[21:42.11]You mean like this lake right here?
[21:45.49]Is there a boat here or should I just keep going?
[21:49.95]No jokes.
[21:50.45]That wasn't a joke.
[21:51.29]Oh, fuck.
[21:54.79]Are you serious?
[21:56.41]No.
[21:57.51]No!
[21:58.05]Oh, come on.
[22:03.32]Already, it's all fucked up.
[22:05.78]I can reverse though, I think, right?
[22:06.84]Yeah.
[22:09.40]What?
[22:10.06]Is this snow?
[22:10.68]What the fuck is this?
[22:11.91]It's like dirt.
[22:12.53]Why can I not move?
[22:13.27]I should be able to move.
[22:18.72]Why the fuck can't I move?
[22:20.04]What?
[22:25.07]Okay, I- What the fuck am I?
[22:32.03]Okay.
[22:33.07]I don't understand.
[22:36.06]Why did the windshield blow up?
[22:40.68]There's a broken TV in my car.
[22:43.82]There's just a shattered fucking plasma screen in my fucking front seat.
[22:49.34]Get it out of there.
[22:53.12]Get it out.
[22:54.99]Get out!
[22:55.49]Oh, fuck it.
[22:57.74]Close the door and let's go.
[22:58.62]No, I need... I at least need my boosh.
[23:06.00]At least I didn't die this time.
[23:08.98]That's true.
[23:17.19]Okay, there we go.
[23:18.99]Should I fill it up?
[23:19.83]No.
[23:20.61]I can get out of this.
[23:24.29]I know I can get out of this.
[23:28.03]Let me just try to... Fuck it.
[23:30.11]What is going on?
[23:30.51]I don't care.
[23:33.69]Just go.
[23:36.97]I did that last time.
[23:37.95]Move it.
[23:44.90]I got it.
[23:45.88]I got the plasma.
[23:47.66]Sell it on eBay.
[23:51.88]I really don't think I can move, guys.
[23:53.84]I think we're walking.
[23:57.70]Unfortunately, I think we have to walk.
[24:01.53]Because this shit ain't happening.
[24:03.53]Give me a fucking break.
[24:05.17]Like, what do I... Why do I deserve this?
[24:07.91]I drove up a small slant.
[24:10.65]And I... Come on, get back there, please.
[24:16.88]Go!
[24:20.58]Go!
[24:22.04]Ugh!
[24:26.26]Press J to push the car?
[24:27.52]What?
[24:27.66]Are you serious?
[24:33.56]Holy shit, he wasn't lying to me.
[24:38.14]J!
[24:39.38]Fucking push!
[24:42.85]Alright, fuck, I... God damn it.
[24:49.07]Reverse?
[24:49.59]I tried that, it didn't do anything.
[24:53.19]Get back in the car, you fucking dingy.
[24:57.13]Get in the car.
[24:58.27]Please, just crouch your head down and get in the fucking car.
[25:01.95]Just lock me in here.
[25:03.19]Reverse.
[25:05.60]Go.
[25:06.64]Oh!
[25:06.74]Alright, we're gonna go back and forth.
[25:09.28]We got it.
[25:09.58]Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[25:21.45]Why is this not working?
[25:23.43]My car is sticking in the air.
[25:26.66]What?
[25:27.92]Why the fuck is that even possible?
[25:32.12]Fuck it, I'm gone.
[25:37.96]We're walking.
[25:45.73]We're walking this way.
[25:49.47]what happened I pushed inside the car I tried it it wouldn't work go diagonally or not you made it worse how do holes work how do holes work I just tried to go back it wouldn't work oh shit the beer you're right I forgot about that good call
[26:20.10]I gotta pee.
[26:22.24]Oh shit, I gotta pee my pants.
[26:23.36]Hold on.
[26:37.33]I'm holebound?
[26:37.99]This stream's gonna go on forever?
[26:40.45]I wouldn't say that.
[26:43.23]I did forget about the TV.
[26:44.41]We gotta at least get the beer.
[26:45.29]That's super important.
[26:49.55]You're gonna log on to the server I'm on and frag me?
[26:52.13]Oh, come get me, man.
[26:54.01]No, you know, I'm gonna give this one last try.
[26:57.21]One final try.
[26:58.03]I'm gonna go reverse.
[27:07.58]I'm just gonna hold this.
[27:09.86]It's like, why are the back wheels not spinning?
[27:12.22]I think, like, the game's bugged out.
[27:13.44]Like, it doesn't think the wheels are here.
[27:18.67]Yeah, it does not think the wheels are here.
[27:22.15]Even when I go in reverse, the wheels are in the ground.
[27:26.83]The wheels are stuck in the ground.
[27:28.25]There's no getting out of this.
[27:29.33]There's a car across the street.
[27:32.45]Are you fucking serious?
[27:33.71]Let's go get it.
[27:36.13]Take the beer and let's get the fuck out of here.
[27:41.68]Come here, you.
[27:42.26]Alright, let's go.
[27:46.42]Push it.
[27:46.80]I already tried that.
[27:47.50]It didn't work.
[27:49.30]Front wheel drive?
[27:51.28]It's like still moving.
[27:58.85]Push.
[28:00.87]Push.
[28:01.37]It's not working.
[28:03.71]Nope.
[28:04.21]There's no way.
[28:09.61]I can't like push it out.
[28:10.62]I can't push it up.
[28:13.44]There's just no way this is happening, guys.
[28:15.16]I'm sorry.
[28:16.34]Does this car have four wheel drive?
[28:21.11]If I push it too hard, I'll just get stuck in... Hold on.
[28:24.85]That just worked.
[28:28.27]That's working.
[28:33.21]Alright, ladies and gentlemen, it's done!
[28:37.65]I got it.
[28:38.79]Don't worry.
[28:40.11]Y'all thought it couldn't be done.
[28:42.49]We're fine.
[28:44.39]Wait, I can't... Don't leave the beer.
[28:49.01]Don't leave the fucking beer.
[28:49.99]That's important.
[28:52.07]You know, that deserves a reward, if you ask me.
[28:56.53]Yeah, just fucking throw it into the car.
[28:58.13]Who gives a fuck?
[29:01.29]Beer, beer, beer.
[29:02.21]No, I would never forget the beer.
[29:04.07]Are you serious?
[29:06.59]And this journey hasn't even fucking begun.
[29:11.15]Back on track, boys and girls.
[29:17.31]Back on track.
[29:19.38]Oh, and the TV, too.
[29:22.28]Forgot about the TV.
[29:23.02]Where's the TV?
[29:26.64]There's the TV.
[29:27.57]Yeah, I can't leave my plasma.
[29:37.45]How am I going to watch my favorite HBO shows?
[29:42.02]Like The Wire.
[29:42.68]Is that closed?
[29:47.00]Hmm.
[29:49.52]I don't know.
[29:50.38]I hope it is.
[29:54.50]Alright, let's go.
[29:57.08]No, no, no, no, no.
[29:57.88]No, don't get stuck again.
[29:58.79]Alright, back on the road.
[30:02.39]Back to reality.
[30:08.65]I'm having a little trouble, guys.
[30:13.79]I'm having a little trouble with, uh... My controller's a little fucked up right now.
[30:19.38]I got some controller issues.
[30:26.37]And on we go.
[30:31.11]Oh, there we go.
[30:31.73]No jokes?
[30:32.17]That wasn't a joke.
[30:32.83]That was an observation.
[30:37.89]That was observational comedy.
[30:39.11]Alright, uh, I have plenty of gas.
[30:44.32]I'm good.
[30:45.26]Oh, I'm getting tired.
[30:46.04]This better not be a joke.
[30:51.74]It's not a joke!
[30:56.52]I'm trying to get to the store.
[30:59.34]It's becoming more and more difficult.
[31:25.15]I just thought of something really funny.
[31:27.19]I just thought of a funny joke that my grandfather told me one time.
[31:32.40]My grandfather told me this really funny joke when I was a kid.
[31:35.82]Alright, no jokes.
[31:37.16]Let's keep going.
[31:37.74]No jokes.
[31:41.63]Everybody, don't worry.
[31:43.23]My grandmother told me this funny toad joke about a toad that fucked up and couldn't get in the lake.
[31:46.87]I don't know.
[31:47.27]Something like that.
[31:50.26]You know, not a big deal.
[31:53.54]Not a big deal.
[31:55.74]This is the way I wanted to go.
[31:58.72]Reading chat and driving.
[32:04.49]Don't do it.
[32:05.17]Good joke.
[32:05.59]Yeah, it wasn't that great.
[32:08.33]Well, okay, here's the joke.
[32:09.35]I don't even remember the joke.
[32:12.81]I forget it.
[32:15.18]Just don't crash.
[32:16.20]That's the one thing I don't want to do.
[32:22.46]Why am I stuck?
[32:23.14]I'm not stuck.
[32:26.14]Tell the joke, please.
[32:28.04]Nah, the punchline takes a little while.
[32:31.81]Maybe I'll tell it someday.
[32:39.91]Maybe I'll tell it someday.
[32:44.94]Yeah, it depends.
[32:47.38]Do a joke with no joke?
[32:49.27]I'm like fatigued.
[32:50.31]Hold on a second.
[32:50.73]Give me a second.
[32:51.25]I'm like really fatigued right now.
[32:53.55]How do I like... I apparently can pee.
[32:56.05]Oh, I got an open windshield.
[32:57.01]This is perfect.
[32:57.47]I can pee right through the windshield.
[33:01.60]Now, I gotta... Hold on.
[33:03.30]Let me just take a second here.
[33:13.57]Yeah, I... Does anybody know like how...
[33:18.81]In this game, is there like a certain... What do you do with money?
[33:24.10]Like, what do you actually do with the money in this game?
[33:26.70]Anybody know?
[33:31.38]What do you actually do with money?
[33:34.97]I have no fucking idea.
[33:41.73]Do you like spend it on something?
[33:43.18]I don't know.
[33:49.63]Like, do you actually... Does anybody know if you... Like, what you... Is it like a... Is it like a currency thing?
[33:58.26]Or, I mean, what is it?
[34:00.86]I'm not sure.
[34:02.02]I mean, is it like some kind of currency thing?
[34:03.72]I'm not sure.
[34:04.24]I don't know.
[34:05.16]I mean, I don't know.
[34:05.88]Is it some kind of currency thing?
[34:07.10]You know, who knows?
[34:08.92]I'm not sure.
[34:10.18]Who knows?
[34:11.74]Not a big deal.
[34:12.24]You know, like, not a big deal at all.
[34:14.90]You know what I'm saying?
[34:16.54]Not a big deal at all.
[34:21.39]Does anybody have anything to do with it?
[34:22.49]What's the, um... I mean, like, oh, anybody... Let me, like, say some shoutouts to some subs.
[34:39.24]Let me say, like, first of all... First of all, let me just say, yeah, first of all, uh... Still here, thank... Hey, thanks for the sub, dude!
[34:46.92]Hey, thanks, man!
[34:49.77]Hey, hey!
[34:50.55]Thanks a lot!
[34:50.97]Appreciate it!
[34:52.11]Hey!
[34:52.65]Appreciate it, man!
[34:59.60]Appreciate it, dude!
[35:00.36]Thanks for the subscription!
[35:01.66]Thank you!
[35:14.68]Yeah, thanks, man.
[35:16.34]Thanks for the subscription, man.
[35:18.96]So, uh, money is like... I think I have to spend it on, um... I'm not sure.
[35:29.31]Do you have to spend, like, money on, uh... Um... I was gonna go this way, right?
[35:39.38]Yeah, I think so.
[35:42.98]Yeah, this is the way I was going before, for sure.
[35:47.70]Wait, what?
[35:54.96]Uh, yeah.
[35:55.65]This is where I got to the house.
[35:56.73]So, I'm going to keep just driving.
[36:00.09]No, I'm going to go this way.
[36:00.79]Fuck it.
[36:05.09]Is that my grand... What do you mean my granddad's joke?
[36:07.63]What are you talking about?
[36:09.25]Is that my granddad's joke?
[36:12.49]Get the shotgun.
[36:13.88]Hmm?
[36:17.94]Do you remember the barn?
[36:21.00]I don't care about the barn.
[36:23.11]I want to just drive and see where I get.
[36:24.43]I think I'm going to gear up.
[36:28.77]Gear up.
[36:30.05]Shift up.
[36:34.99]Ramming speed.
[36:38.78]More facecam?
[36:39.44]What are you talking about?
[36:40.36]More facecam.
[36:42.70]We're talking about my granddad's joke.
[36:48.08]What is this?
[36:48.46]We're going to investigate this.
[37:00.85]Is that something I can just get in?
[37:03.15]I want to look at this.
[37:03.99]I want to investigate.
[37:04.65]Give me a second.
[37:05.09]Let me investigate.
[37:06.85]Let me try to get out of here.
[37:12.38]And... Crash into it again is a joke.
[37:16.00]No, this is a no-joke stream, dude.
[37:19.52]Nothing even in here.
[37:22.92]Not that I can see, at least.
[37:23.88]No.
[37:24.16]It's just like a random... It's nothing.
[37:30.05]There's nothing there.
[37:33.71]Just get back in the car.
[37:34.65]Wait, wait, wait.
[37:35.57]I gotta like... I'm dirty.
[37:38.07]How do I clean myself?
[37:43.27]Let me get in the back.
[37:44.85]I'm just gonna sit in the back and have a couple of drinks.
[37:50.30]This used to be a no joke stream.
[37:52.22]I didn't tell a joke.
[37:59.04]Does this game have an objective?
[38:00.36]I don't think it does.
[38:01.56]I think you're just supposed to go buy things and just hang out and drive around.
[38:04.32]You're supposed to build a car.
[38:06.07]But I never did it.
[38:07.73]You know?
[38:08.23]Like, it was nothing... Not that I'm against building the car.
[38:10.79]I just don't think it's like I could do it on stream.
[38:15.21]I don't want to... Let me pee for a little bit.
[38:16.71]Let me pee for a little bit.
[38:18.17]Push the roof with my hands.
[38:24.79]Can you show your face?
[38:25.96]I mean, I did that.
[38:28.08]I have been doing that.
[38:32.71]I showed it a few times, I think.
[38:34.22]Like, earlier.
[38:36.12]Showed it a couple times.
[38:36.92]Not a big deal.
[38:38.54]It's just my face, guys.
[38:40.60]You don't need to see it all the time.
[38:46.41]You could do it off-stream, I know.
[38:48.61]Hey, is that some kind of shot?
[38:52.55]I could do it.
[38:54.65]You don't think I could do it off-stream?
[38:58.71]Oh, shit!
[38:59.26]The trunk!
[39:01.34]I don't want to lose my fucking HD DVD.
[39:02.72]Let me just get out.
[39:11.73]Oh, thank God everything's safe.
[39:14.31]Good.
[39:14.89]Everything is safe.
[39:19.20]Alright, traffic mode.
[39:19.84]Let's go.
[39:24.74]What's going on?
[39:26.92]What's going on?
[39:28.12]Why was that holding down like that?
[39:31.21]I didn't do that.
[39:34.27]I did not do that.
[39:41.91]Did I already... Wait, did I drive by this?
[39:44.06]I, like, completely forget.
[39:49.34]I don't have any idea.
[39:50.48]We're just driving into the fucking wilderness.
[39:56.18]Did I... Wait, did I go back this way?
[39:57.60]I don't fucking remember.
[40:01.20]I think I did go back this way.
[40:02.46]Shit, I think I gotta turn around.
[40:07.63]Yeah.
[40:08.39]Wow, this is like a real road.
[40:09.77]Holy shit.
[40:10.85]A real road.
[40:11.61]This is the first time we've seen an actual road.
[40:16.79]Wow, I'm excited.
[40:17.55]Where's it gonna go this way?
[40:30.28]That was fine.
[40:34.25]Just go the other way?
[40:35.57]Turn around?
[40:36.51]Yeah, it likes to peel out.
[40:42.65]Wait, that's... Oh, God.
[40:43.97]Get over here, please.
[40:45.71]Come here.
[40:46.06]Come here.
[40:47.48]I gotta chase this fucking guy down.
[40:48.48]Why is he going so fast?
[40:49.50]Holy fuck.
[40:50.00]Are you serious, dude?
[40:52.38]What?
[40:53.18]That guy was going a thousand miles per hour.
[40:54.66]I'm following that guy.
[41:04.32]I still see him.
[41:09.44]I still see him.
