[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.82]Ladies and gentlemen, please welcome the chairman and the sole proprietor of the Jerma Wrestling Federation, Jerma985.
[00:12.32]Here to do the opening ceremonies for our first ever Jermania.
[00:21.05]Just wanna say welcome everybody to Jermania 2014.
[00:23.95]That's right, that's right.
[00:28.95]Let me hear you scream.
[00:30.49]Pump it up, baby.
[00:32.77]So we got a lot of cool shit planned for you guys tonight.
[00:35.25]We got a lot of awesome matches.
[00:37.86]And I just want to be real clear with you all about something tonight.
[00:41.82]If any of you think I'm going to lose the championship match against Captain Crunch, then you got something coming.
[00:47.70]If you think I'm that bad to lose against a serial character... And here we go.
[00:53.71]Ladies and gentlemen, if you don't know that music, you should, because it's none other than Glue Man.
[00:58.89]After what happened last time at Jerma Rumble 2, I'm sure he has something to say to Jerma.
[01:07.54]The fuck are you doing here, Glue Man?
[01:09.55]This is my night.
[01:10.85]Jeez.
[01:11.91]Yes, it is just always about you, isn't it, Jerma?
[01:14.99]Well, I've got a surprise for you.
[01:17.10]Surprise?
[01:18.26]I mean, I wasn't aware of a surprise.
[01:20.48]It's me you'll be facing in the championship match.
[01:23.50]What?
[01:24.74]What?
[01:25.00]That's impossible.
[01:26.30]Where's Captain Crunch?
[01:28.02]Captain Crunch and Jerma both won the Jerma Rumbles.
[01:30.46]They're the ones that are eligible for the championship.
[01:32.27]This is a revelation indeed.
[01:34.27]What is going to happen next?
[01:45.58]Welcome back, ladies and gentlemen, to Jermania 2014.
[01:47.72]We're going to get the first match underway, and it's going to be starring none other than Gabe Newell, who you all know and love.
[01:55.96]Gabe Newell is going to be facing a couple of different opponents here.
[01:58.50]He's going to be... Gabe Newell gets attacked from behind by Sonic the Hedgehog with a chair.
[02:02.92]Sonic the Hedgehog and Pac-Man behind him.
[02:04.63]These are his two opponents, by the way.
[02:07.51]No introductions have gone down.
[02:09.03]It's just Gabe Newell coming down by himself, and he gets absolutely ambushed.
[02:13.05]by these two disgraceful wrestlers, can I just say right now, and Gabe Newell gonna take a chair shot right in his face, and the match hasn't even started.
[02:21.13]This is just even more ridiculous when you consider the match you're about to see is a 2v1 handicap tornado tag match.
[02:29.02]Gabe Newell versus Sonic and Pac-Man in the ring at the same time, and you're gonna see Gabe Newell flustered right now.
[02:34.62]He's trying to keep his composure, but how can you after something so disgraceful like that?
[02:38.99]And there's the bell, ladies and gentlemen, first match of Jermania 2014.
[02:43.05]What a way to start it and right off the bat Gabe Newell takes a double DDT on top of all the punishment He has seen so far and I'm not exactly sure why there's a referee in the ring Can we stay very very clearly state this the referee serves no purpose because there are no rules in the Jerma arena There is no set rules anything can happen as to why what we just saw was totally legal and what a spinning almost a neck break type move on the top rope and
[03:09.42]pulling him down, and Gabe Newell spins and slams his face on Sonic's face into the ground while Pac-Man sort of just sits there watching.
[03:16.68]And you might be wondering, why this?
[03:19.31]Why does Gabe Newell have to go against these two fighters at the same time?
[03:23.57]Well, it was a challenge that Sonic gave to Gabe Newell after he was humiliated in the first Jerma Rumble with the powerbomb over the top turnbuckle that Gabe Newell did to him, and his choice was Pac-Man...
[03:34.74]I'm not exactly sure why you'd pick Pac- Pac- Pac-Man is going after the referee!
[03:38.24]Pac-Man just tried to punch the referee in the face!
[03:40.52]I think he might be a little confused as to who the opponents are, but that's Pac-Man.
[03:45.76]He kind of just does his own thing, and you can't really corral him.
[03:48.60]But I'm assuming it's because they have a lot of history, they're both very old characters, probably friends from 20, 30 years ago.
[03:54.97]And what a DDT, double DDT by Gabe Newell, and the crowd is getting really riled up right now on what's happening!
[04:00.15]Someone's coming down to the arena!
[04:01.94]That's Gordon Freeman!
[04:02.96]Gordon Freeman was watching backstage, no doubt got sick and tired of watching this 2v1.
[04:07.34]Sonic and Pac-Man beating up on his boss.
[04:09.50]He's gonna come in and even the odds for sure here.
[04:12.25]And he slides in the ring looking for some blood.
[04:15.09]And it looks like, no, no, no!
[04:17.09]He punches Gabe Newell in the face!
[04:18.81]He punched Gabe Newell right in the face!
[04:21.07]And here comes the spy!
[04:22.71]Sprinting down to the arena, he's not going to waste any time.
[04:24.96]He sees his bosses in dire need.
[04:26.56]It's his favorite class, the spy.
[04:28.40]Gordon Freeman gets out and goes right for him.
[04:31.30]And it seems like the spy just picked up a sledgehammer from underneath the ring.
[04:35.50]The spy took a sledgehammer from underneath and is smashing Gordon Freeman with it.
[04:39.88]This is getting insane.
[04:41.46]I can't believe what I'm seeing right here.
[04:42.98]And all the while, Gabe Newell with a fantastic double DDT.
[04:48.11]Wow.
[04:48.91]Okay, maybe take a little bit of a breather after that one.
[04:51.21]No time for a breather.
[04:52.23]There's no time for a breather.
[04:53.15]Look at this crossface.
[04:54.85]Sonic is in a crossface right now while Pac-Man is face down on the mat.
[04:58.09]Gabe Newell could get a submission here.
[04:59.51]He's taking any second here.
[05:00.72]Oh, Pac-Man with a nice breakup elbow drop on Gabe Newell, who could have easily just walked away right there with a victory had he not broken it up.
[05:09.66]But this has become an intense, insanely intense first match here in Jermania 2004.
[05:15.26]What the fuck is Pac-Man doing?
[05:18.04]Okay, he just like flipped himself over the ropes.
[05:19.92]That was a little odd.
[05:20.62]He got a chair.
[05:21.64]That's what he was doing.
[05:22.36]He knew exactly what he was doing.
[05:23.81]Picking up a chair from under the ring.
[05:25.41]There are no rules, remember guys.
[05:27.81]Nobody can be disqualified for any of this behavior that you're seeing right here.
[05:33.09]And Gabe Newell's being held back by Sonic and Pac-Man's not doing anything.
[05:37.60]Pac-Man is staring at him with the chair.
[05:40.08]I think Gabe Newell is kind of confused as well, and he gets a bulldog for his trouble.
[05:43.24]Pac-Man, I think, blew a casket in his brain and is just standing there with the chair in his hand.
[05:48.70]I think when he went from point A to point B, picking chair up and putting chair in hand may have just ruined his whole brain.
[05:56.33]I'm not sure, but we're gonna talk about what's actually happening.
[05:59.15]Gabe Newell and Sonic the Hedgehog seem to be in a 1v1 situation at this point.
[06:03.31]And you got the Spy and Gordon Freeman on your left, so remember they're still there.
[06:07.14]And you gotta figure that Gabe is gonna try to take the fullest advantage of this situation.
[06:11.18]Looks like he has a chance right here, gonna set Sonic up in a Power Bomb!
[06:14.52]Just like the first Jerma Rumble!
[06:16.12]Can he capitalize?!
[06:17.44]He brings him straight down with a Razor's Edge!
[06:19.66]This could be it!
[06:20.58]Pac-Man is still catatonic!
[06:22.08]Can he get the one count?
[06:22.90]He gets one!
[06:23.92]He gets two!
[06:25.34]And he got the third one, he got the third one, and Pac-Man just drunkenly falls over with the chair.
[06:30.05]What was he doing that whole time?
[06:32.27]Nobody will ever know the answer to that question, but Gabe Newell goes against all odds at a 3v1 at one point before the spy came in.
[06:41.42]and sealed himself the victory.
[06:43.74]So Gabe Newell, congratulations on the first match win.
[06:48.15]And apparently we're gonna go backstage right now.
[06:50.37]A fight has broken out in the garage area.
[06:53.21]I'm not entirely sure what's happening, though those are Biaz.
[06:55.94]Those are the four Biaz that are supposed to be in the cage match for the third match of Jermania.
[07:01.42]Hopefully they don't waste all their energy by preemptively getting started.
[07:04.91]And if you want my personal opinion on this, you can't put a bunch of Biaz in the same dressing room and only have one McDonald's Happy Meal in there.
[07:13.10]That's how this shit gets started.
[07:15.12]But whatever, we've got a match to get to, second match of Jermania coming up right now!
[07:19.16]Here it is, the introductions have already been started.
[07:21.97]This match is going to be a very, very interesting one.
[07:25.85]We've got a gauntlet match lined up here.
[07:27.85]If you don't know what a gauntlet match is, it's when one person has to consecutively go against multiple other opponents, and in this case it's going to be Grandpa versus all the shitty characters.
[07:39.04]And this is a request from Grandpa, he said, So, he's gonna get that opportunity, starting with the 30s Milkman, who is, in my opinion, the worst character that's ever been made.
[07:54.75]I've said this before, I've brought up a lot of the different shitty characters that have been made, I think Milkman is the worst one.
[08:00.79]Because, I mean, he's just like a guy with white pants and a white shirt and a hat on.
[08:04.30]Like, the guy sucks.
[08:05.74]But, that's the bell, so that means we're gonna get started here.
[08:08.94]If Grandpa pins the Milkman, that means that somebody else, one of the other shitty characters, is gonna come down.
[08:15.41]It's gonna be one after the other after the other after the other, and the only way this can be stopped is if Grandpa goes through all of them, or if somebody ends up pinning Grandpa.
[08:25.08]So...
[08:26.18]It's gonna get pretty interesting.
[08:27.54]Hopefully, I mean, the Milkman could just win right now.
[08:31.04]And that would be a pretty awful match.
[08:33.28]So I'm assuming Grandpa has it in him to at least get through one person.
[08:37.53]Or two people.
[08:38.47]I mean, as kind of sloppy and shitty that Grandpa is.
[08:41.59]Grandpa himself...
[08:42.91]is kind of a shitty character, but, you know, we won't say that too loudly so he doesn't hear us.
[08:47.95]Well, he sets up a neck breaker, and Milkman's legs almost got caught on the ropes there.
[08:52.73]Well, Grandpa's gonna go for a pin.
[08:54.29]One!
[08:54.45]He gets the one count.
[08:56.61]And typically when you see a one count, it means that the other person is almost totally fine.
[09:02.27]There is really no damage being done by Grandpa, or... What the hell was that?
[09:08.09]That was like a toddler picking up an adult and putting him on his face.
[09:11.96]Like, that was a... Oh, what a reversal by Grandpa.
[09:14.50]Gonna turn this into another... I mean, he's favoring the dropkicks for some reason.
[09:18.00]Grandpa really likes those dropkicks, and he's gonna go for a knee smash here into the ground.
[09:21.80]No, that probably hurts.
[09:23.04]Yeah, that probably does hurt.
[09:23.88]Gonna go for another pin.
[09:24.70]Gets the one.
[09:25.83]One count again.
[09:27.41]So very clearly, this is quite a stalemate between two weak-ass people.
[09:31.67]And Grandpa, I don't know what he's expecting here.
[09:34.05]If he can't even go through the 30s milkman, while he gets spun around and slammed on his back, if Grandpa cannot even go through the 30s milkman,
[09:42.84]How does he expect to go through six more people after this?
[09:45.54]I'm looking at my notes here.
[09:47.26]I'm pretty sure it is six people.
[09:49.80]So, good luck to you, Grandpa.
[09:51.88]While he lines up some type of maneuver here.
[09:55.10]Really had to get his footing there.
[09:56.12]Knee smash right in the face.
[09:57.93]Jumping almost on the throat there on Milkman.
[09:59.77]Gonna go for a pin.
[10:00.99]One, two.
[10:01.93]Finally gets the two count on the Milkman.
[10:05.17]So, progress is being made.
[10:07.11]As awful progress as it is.
[10:09.09]While he throws him into the ropes there.
[10:10.51]It's still progress, and...
[10:12.29]As much as... Grant- You wanna shut the fuck up over here?
[10:14.72]You wanna shut the fuck up?
[10:15.50]What are you doing?
[10:16.24]I can hear every single word you're saying!
[10:18.07]Dude, just don't destroy the desk!
[10:20.80]Oh, no.
[10:26.72]See, that's what happens.
[10:29.05]You can't do that, Grandpa.
[10:30.93]He gets picked up by Milkman.
[10:32.75]Milkman had kind of floated his way out here somehow, but now they're over here.
[10:37.53]Grandpa, no, no, no, no.
[10:38.99]No, this is not the time to be doing this.
[10:41.25]This is our commentary.
[10:43.96]Oh, okay.
[10:45.30]Alright, alright.
[10:47.06]Go away.
[10:47.52]Thank you very much.
[10:49.10]Milkman.
[10:50.68]Milkman, are you alright?
[10:52.32]He's not responding.
[10:53.66]The referee has rung the bell, which means the next combatant has to go in.
[10:56.93]He can't perform anymore, so it's gonna be the Chicken.
[10:59.23]And someone's coming from the Raptors!
[11:01.13]Somebody just splashed off of the Titantron!
[11:03.89]That's the turkey!
[11:05.12]That's the turkey!
[11:05.78]That's the Chicken's long-lost rival!
[11:08.32]I am shocked that he is able to get up and walk around after a 50-plus foot jump right there.
[11:13.81]And there's Martin Van Buren from behind.
[11:16.27]They're not even coming out in the right order.
[11:18.05]This is supposed to be a gauntlet match.
[11:19.73]They're not even coming out in the right order.
[11:21.28]It's supposed to be one after the other.
[11:22.40]What are they doing?
[11:23.04]What triggered this?
[11:24.60]I seriously don't... Santa Claus is under the ring!
[11:27.76]Santa Claus has been under that ring for probably like three hours, by the way.
[11:31.67]Meanwhile, Grandpa, not paying any attention to who's behind him, that's Batboy with a clothesline!
[11:37.87]He's supposed to be dead!
[11:39.35]Batboy is supposed to be dead right now, but for some reason he just snuck up behind him.
[11:43.47]Is he even supposed to be in this?
[11:45.22]He's not!
[11:46.66]Everybody that is supposed to be a combatant in this gauntlet is over on the left side fighting right now.
[11:52.44]And Batboy is in the ring.
[11:53.78]Does this even qualify as a match anymore?
[11:55.52]I'm not sure, but what a spinning kick.
[11:57.70]Just laying Grandpa out, who must be pretty annoyed right now.
[12:01.74]He went through Milkman.
[12:03.37]and then was supposed to go after the chicken, the turkey showed up, Van Buren showed up, all these people showed up when they weren't really supposed to, and there's just chaos going on on the left side.
[12:12.67]I'm not sure if we can cut to that for a second.
[12:14.71]I want you to see what's going on.
[12:15.91]Milkman has gotten up, and he is just taunting Santa Claus.
[12:20.01]I'm not sure why, but Santa Claus and the Milkman are both gonna go out of here.
[12:23.19]No, we got the turkey, Van Buren trying to keep the peace!
[12:25.69]Santa Claus is gonna go for a punch!
[12:26.97]Santa Claus punches him in the face, and the Milkman is not happy, jumping across and hitting him!
[12:31.02]I think I saw the egg there as well, so I don't know what's happening.
[12:34.70]I think when you bring the term shitty character in, and this is my personal opinion, I think this is what happened.
[12:40.66]Everybody here, it was called a shitty character, and I think that they are all pissed about that and trying to prove to each other that they are not the shitty character, but we got Grandpa with a one, a two, could it be a... Oh, he didn't get the three count!
[12:52.89]He just barely did not get the three count.
[12:54.81]That was centimeters away from the three count.
[12:57.35]And now we got a good old-fashioned slobber knocker in the middle of the ring.
[13:00.11]Grandpa doing some right hands.
[13:01.49]And here comes Van Buren to break it up.
[13:04.05]I'm assuming he's on the side of Batboy, but you really never know what's going on.
[13:07.89]Now he's getting stomped.
[13:08.93]And here comes everybody else.
[13:10.55]This ring is going to get flooded with people right now.
[13:12.73]Could be a huge standoff between all these characters.
[13:15.51]Grandpa in the corner just barely getting himself up.
[13:18.67]And...
[13:20.11]Oh, no.
[13:21.47]Grandpa, you are in a world of shit right now, but he still has at least a little bit of life left in him.
[13:25.88]Can he take on all of these shitty characters?
[13:28.06]Doesn't look like it.
[13:28.86]He's getting overwhelmed at this point.
[13:30.58]Ring the bell.
[13:31.68]Ring the bell.
[13:32.14]This is over.
[13:33.32]I've seen enough.
[13:33.84]I don't want to see any more of this.
[13:35.68]Please just get this ring clear.
[13:37.63]Everybody's disqualified.
[13:39.27]We're gonna move on to the next match.
[13:40.77]We'll see you all in a few moments.
[13:43.55]Poor Grandpa.
[13:46.62]But you agree with me though, right?
[13:48.12]No, I do agree with you.
[13:49.28]I think if we can't get a hold of Captain Crunch, no one's heard of him in like six weeks, and the egg went to dinner with his wife, and it's gonna have to be you in the ladder match, it is.
[13:58.65]You just tell me when to go, I'm ready.
[14:00.49]I'll be here, I'll be in the backstage, I'll be ready whenever you need me.
[14:02.83]You're a bunch of bullshit.
[14:07.96]This is still going on.
[14:09.63]This is still going on backstage.
[14:11.57]They're still beating the shit out of each other.
[14:13.27]He's gonna put his head in a car.
[14:15.19]He just slammed his head in a car door.
[14:17.49]Can we get... Why is he pinning him?
[14:19.55]There's nobody there.
[14:20.28]There's no pins right now.
[14:21.44]I think they are just all so fucking drunk that they have no idea that they're not even in a match right now.
[14:26.84]I think they thought... They might think they've been in the match the entire time.
[14:30.06]But they're supposed to be in a cage match right now.
[14:32.55]And they're not...
[14:34.11]Okay, we're gonna let them just fight.
[14:36.07]This is the third match.
[14:38.05]Because they won't... Okay, they're obviously not listening, so we're gonna just get right into this here.
[14:41.61]This is a four-way Bia backstage battle, and the last man standing wins.
[14:46.48]That's what I've been told by my producers, and that's what we're going to do.
[14:49.18]So, it seems like Lumberjack Bia and King Bia...
[14:52.88]are fighting each other.
[14:53.78]I don't know why he's calling himself King Bia.
[14:55.66]They don't like being associated with numbers anymore, apparently.
[14:58.84]That's something I was told before the show started, that it's no longer Bia number 25, Bia number 300.
[15:04.94]King Bia, by the way, looked like he was down for the count there.
[15:07.97]But he gets back up, and it seems like Sexy Bia and Big Boy Bia, that's the other two, by the way, if you're wondering, if you're keeping track, but who really is, they're all Bias.
[15:18.83]It doesn't really matter.
[15:20.49]But yeah, last man standing.
[15:21.47]We got a suplex, a tiger suplex onto the concrete.
[15:24.73]Remember, this is concrete.
[15:26.72]There is no mat.
[15:27.90]There is no soft area for you to land on.
[15:30.30]They're just throwing each other into stuff just like that.
[15:33.04]Right into the wall goes Sexy Bia by Lumberjack Bia.
[15:36.68]And if I were to guess, if I were to take a wild guess, I'm going to say King Bia is going to win this because he's the King Bia.
[15:43.41]No, King Bia's down.
[15:45.03]King Bia is down for the count.
[15:46.29]He's not getting up.
[15:46.89]So is Sexy Bia.
[15:48.07]We're down to two already.
[15:50.11]I guess I'll give them a little bit of credit where it's due.
[15:52.25]They have been going at it for the entire evening so far.
[15:56.01]So this is not totally unexpected that two of them would go down.
[16:00.02]I'm surprised any of them are standing at this point.
[16:02.42]What a slam!
[16:03.22]He slammed his head on the side of that wall.
[16:06.00]That is a solid wall.
[16:07.84]How are these two still alive?
[16:09.08]A better question is, are the two on the ground even still alive?
[16:13.53]I'm not even entirely certain.
[16:15.49]What I am certain of is...
[16:17.71]These guys are gonna owe us a lot of money, because they told us they were gonna do a cage match.
[16:21.98]We bought the cage.
[16:23.12]It cost, like, seven and a half thousand dollars to get that cage here, and they're not even using it.
[16:28.22]So, somebody owes us a lot of money.
[16:29.98]And I don't know who's, uh, they have, like, a Biaf fund, but they better pay up.
[16:34.19]Groin kick by Big Boy Biaf to Lumberjack Biaf, but he receives a couple of punches for his trouble, and he gets, Lumberjack Biaf gets an elbow in the face, which kind of distracted him for a second, and there he goes!
[16:44.13]Down, his head hit the ground, that's it!
[16:46.31]The Bjerre Battle Royale is going to go to Bjerre 419, or Big Boy Bjerre, as he likes to be called, doing a lot of trash talking and making his way out of the arena.
[16:57.38]And look out, look out, hey, wait, whoa, whoa, watch out!
[17:00.15]Oh!
[17:01.65]What the, who was that?
[17:04.07]Why, who would do that?
[17:17.93]I'm the only beer that matters.
[17:21.05]Fuck all those pieces of fuck.
[17:24.15]We're back, ladies and gentlemen, with the final match of the evening.
[17:27.55]This is the main event of Jermania 2014, as we learned not that long ago.
[17:33.79]This is going to be a ladder match between Glue Man and Jerma for the World Championship of Jerma Wrestling Federation.
[17:42.74]It should be a good one.
[17:44.12]My blood is boiling.
[17:45.44]Let's get to the contestants.
[17:47.30]Coming down to the arena first is going to be Jerma, who does not really need an introduction.
[17:52.02]I don't need to tell you who this guy is.
[17:53.40]A lot of you already know, and if you're just finding this video somehow and you don't know who I am or who this guy is, well then, hi.
[18:00.09]Welcome to Jerma985.
[18:01.19]I hope you enjoy your stay.
[18:02.99]Anywho, we're gonna get to the next contestant, and the next contestant is Glue Man, who is kind of on a mission here.
[18:09.47]Glue Man is well aware that he was created as a shitty character.
[18:13.23]Glue Man is well aware that he's just been ridiculed, and everyone thinks he's a joke, and he is out for blood tonight.
[18:19.32]He's out to prove everybody wrong, that not only can you rise up from the bottom, but you can stay at the top as well.
[18:26.68]And here's to hoping we get to see a very good match between these two very skilled to very skilled opponents to each other.
[18:33.27]And we're going to get the ladders involved as well, so ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the main event!
[18:38.15]There is the bell, everybody.
[18:40.54]Hope you have your popcorn ready, because this one is going to be a doozy indeed.
[18:45.22]A lot of history here, a lot of aggression, and a lot of things that need to be dealt with, a lot of problems that have to be sorted out between these two, and this is a perfect place to do it at the main event of Jermania.
[18:56.61]The coveted World Championship of Jerma Wrestling Federation is on the line here.
[19:01.95]This is it.
[19:02.99]This is the one.
[19:03.79]There is no other title.
[19:05.05]There are no other titles besides the World Championship.
[19:08.21]Unlike other wrestling venues, there is only one.
[19:11.83]And it is this one.
[19:12.63]What a belly to back suplex.
[19:14.07]It backflips him.
[19:15.13]That'll take the wind out of your sails real quickly.
[19:17.89]Follows it up with a couple of punches to Glue Man's face.
[19:21.05]And I would like to address this really, really shortly.
[19:24.51]If Glue Man is made out of glue, right?
[19:26.70]Because that's like what he's supposed to be.
[19:28.04]He's supposed to be a man made out of glue.
[19:30.60]How do you feel pain?
[19:31.82]Does he feel pain?
[19:33.01]Does he break bones?
[19:34.23]Does he have any bones?
[19:35.91]That is a question for a scientist and not a question for me.
[19:40.28]but we're gonna get back to the action here wanted to talk about the ladders because if you're unaware if you don't know how a ladder match works in a wrestling federation essentially it's somebody has to pull that ladder into the ring and the championship briefcase is floating above on the catwalk so what you have to do is you have to put the ladder down beautiful ddt by the way you have to put a ladder down
[20:02.42]climb up and grab the briefcase and rip it down.
[20:05.79]That's the only way to win this match.
[20:08.35]You cannot pin.
[20:09.41]There is no giving up.
[20:10.85]It's only climbing up that ladder.
[20:13.55]And there are a couple of them surrounding the ring, so their options here are pretty varied.
[20:19.72]They can go from either side of the ring, which looks like Jerma might be doing it, might be picking up the ladder for the first time.
[20:23.98]He's got a ladder, throwing it into the ring.
[20:25.96]This is where it gets interesting.
[20:27.83]No, they're gonna stay outside.
[20:29.75]Usually, once the ladder gets put into play, that's when you see... Oh, what a cheap shot.
[20:34.59]What a cheap shot by Jerma.
[20:35.95]That was disgraceful.
[20:37.37]That was unbelievable.
[20:38.39]You don't pull that in a championship match.
[20:40.53]Well, I guess you do if you want to win, which Jerma will do anything to win, apparently.
[20:46.01]Well, he belly-to-belly suplex.
[20:47.67]Blue Man almost into the stairs there.
[20:50.31]And now the Glue Man is incapacitated.
[20:51.85]It seems like Jerma's gonna set the ladder up here for the first time.
[20:54.15]Maybe he's gonna go for it.
[20:54.82]He's gonna hit him with the ladder.
[20:55.94]He doesn't hit him.
[20:56.46]He gets reversed.
[20:57.64]He blocks the ladder and pulls it out of his hands and hits him with it.
[21:00.74]And Jerma goes down.
[21:01.60]And this is where the ladder gets set up.
[21:03.04]What superhuman strength by Glue Man.
[21:05.64]And this could be the end, ladies and gentlemen.
[21:07.08]There's the briefcase.
[21:07.98]He's got a hold of it.
[21:08.96]Jerma's gotta do something real quick here.
[21:11.06]Grabs him right by the coattails and pulls him down.
[21:13.48]That was very, very close.
[21:15.76]And something is happening.
[21:17.64]Oh, no, no, no.
[21:18.94]No, don't even tell me this.
[21:20.76]Are you fucking serious right now?
[21:23.19]Captain Crunch is in the crowd, dancing and singing.
[21:27.57]What is he doing?
[21:28.72]And what is going on with that microphone?
[21:30.40]What kind of fucking sorcery is going on in the crowd right now?
[21:33.68]You have not answered any of our phone calls.
[21:35.92]You're just going to show up in the middle of the last match?
[21:38.82]That's unbelievable.
[21:40.20]And all the while, we got something climbing up on top.
[21:42.18]Jermaine and Gloom Man are both on top.
[21:43.46]Thank God the cameraman got here in time.
[21:45.04]This could be the end.
[21:46.30]Who's going to go down?
[21:47.32]Jermaine with a powerbomb off of the ladder.
[21:49.37]My goodness.
[21:50.71]Blue Man is now bleeding off of his forehead while Captain Crunch is still dancing.
[21:54.55]He's gonna hop over that little barricade there.
[21:56.61]Are we gonna see a three-way triple threat ladder match right now?
[22:00.92]Is Captain Crunch gonna get in the ring?
[22:02.60]We have no idea.
[22:04.04]Looks like he is.
[22:04.70]He's grabbing another ladder.
[22:06.60]Here we go, ladies and gentlemen.
[22:07.89]This is what you live for.
[22:09.25]This is what you watch for.
[22:10.87]This is a triple threat match now between Captain Crunch, Glue Man, and Jerma.
[22:14.96]And as we see Jerma gonna slowly climb up here.
[22:17.82]Everybody seems to be distracted.
[22:19.00]Jerma is very tired.
[22:20.66]Going for that briefcase.
[22:21.77]Nobody is paying any attention to him.
[22:23.63]He gets knocked over, hanging by the briefcase, and he gets picked up by Captain Crunch and slammed on his back!
[22:28.91]What calamity!
[22:30.15]What insanity!
[22:31.39]And Captain Crunch, while Glue Man is lying down, Captain Crunch might be setting up for Crunchatize Me Captain!
[22:36.64]That's what it is!
[22:37.74]There it is, ladies and gentlemen, that's his signature move!
[22:40.50]He perfected that for many years, and I just gotta say this, I wanna state this very clearly while we have a second here,
[22:46.51]Bill, how have you not said one single word during this entire broadcast?
[22:52.51]How the fuck is that even possible?
[22:54.63]I kinda just like to watch.
[22:57.61]Alright, well, whatever.
[22:59.11]Back to the action now.
[23:00.47]It seems like all three competitors are standing on their feet, which is a pretty rare occurrence in a ladder match.
[23:06.21]And this could be a good opportunity here.
[23:07.86]Yup, that's a great idea.
[23:09.76]Double teaming on Captain Crunch.
[23:11.56]He's a fresh competitor.
[23:13.04]He has not been running around.
[23:14.20]He's been just in the crowd hanging out.
[23:16.38]Good idea to take him down.
[23:17.96]And what is Jerma doing?
[23:19.64]Why did he throw down that ladder into the turnbuckle?
[23:21.84]That doesn't seem like it makes very much sense at all, and Captain Crunch just gets a triple beating, punches in his face, and Jerma, with a nice fireman's carry, throws him over, and here comes the ladder again.
[23:32.41]Setting it up this time, was maybe thinking about doing something in that corner, but did not capitalize.
[23:36.96]While Glue Man picks up a ladder, Jerma's just gonna go up.
[23:39.66]Jerma's just gonna go, what is he doing?
[23:41.36]Why would you do that?
[23:42.90]He just tried to climb the ladder in front of Captain Crunch, and speaking of Captain Crunch, he's in the Glue Man's signature move, the Tombstone!
[23:48.71]Captain Crunch reverses it!
[23:50.25]Does the Tombstone to Glue Man!
[23:52.05]This is it!
[23:53.05]Get the ladder!
[23:53.85]Get the ladder and climb up!
[23:54.89]No!
[23:55.41]He's signaling for his finishing move!
[23:57.39]The Captain's kick!
[23:58.79]There it is!
[23:59.65]Captain's kick!
[24:00.61]This is gonna be the end right here.
[24:01.67]He's picking him up.
[24:02.34]Why are you picking him up?
[24:03.60]Put him back down and climb the ladder.
[24:05.42]He just got way too cocky right there and it could be his downfall while Glue Man goes over to pick up the other ladder.
[24:11.76]Where is he setting this up?
[24:12.64]What's he doing?
[24:13.22]Captain Crunch runs into it and blocks it.
[24:15.13]What are they doing?
[24:16.05]He's gonna go for a swing.
[24:16.81]They're both running into each other.
[24:18.37]This is Captain Crunch with a beautiful double-handed swing.
[24:21.53]And pay attention to Jerma, guys.
[24:23.77]He has been sitting down like that for the last minute or so.
[24:26.96]He has not gotten up.
[24:27.88]And Glue Man also on the ground.
[24:30.24]Captain Crunch has an opportunity.
[24:32.12]Got both of his hands on it.
[24:33.38]Is this going to be the end?
[24:34.14]That's the end.
[24:35.30]That is the end, ladies and gentlemen.
[24:37.27]Captain Crunch is the Jerma Wrestling Federation champion.
[24:42.17]What an absolutely absurd, insane ending to a crazy night.
[24:48.37]I had no idea that Captain Crunch was going to be showing up to the arena.
[24:51.65]What's in that briefcase?
[24:52.72]Nobody will ever know.
[24:53.52]It's probably like 30 bucks.
[24:55.56]So it was definitely worth it.
[24:57.22]All this trouble for Captain Crunch to come down here and win that briefcase.
[25:01.62]So thank you all so much for watching.
[25:03.40]It's been an absolute pleasure bringing you Jermania 2014.
[25:06.26]And we'll see you next time.
[25:09.24]Take care, everybody, and have a wonderful night.
