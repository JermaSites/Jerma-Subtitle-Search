[00:35.87]hello welcome to another edition of guy sits a chair plays a game your face I'm your host true but I did fight yeah I've been drinking all day no hi how you doing welcome to part two of
[01:03.26]Detroit.
[01:04.96]Get a load of this human.
[01:05.76]I'm going to try to finish the game tonight.
[01:08.80]If we don't, then... We're never going to see the end, apparently.
[01:11.73]We're just going to have to YouTube the ending.
[01:15.73]No.
[01:17.15]If for some reason tonight we don't finish this, then we will finish it probably tomorrow.
[01:24.27]I'm fairly certain we have like five or six more hours in the game, so we're probably going to get it done.
[01:35.89]Actually, no, I can't do it tomorrow.
[01:37.09]I have doctors coming tomorrow.
[01:38.31]I can't do it.
[01:41.21]So, better do it today, or you're never going to see the end of the game.
[01:49.40]Probably won't finish it tonight.
[01:51.78]Alright, so after yesterday, when everyone was saying, oh, it's like 16 hours, it's like 14 hours.
[01:57.99]I went to the, you know, the how long to be website, and it says on average like 11 to 12 hours.
[02:04.01]And David Cage himself said it should take like 8 to 10 hours to be.
[02:09.88]So, I think we're going to be alright.
[02:16.62]Lies.
[02:16.98]Look it up.
[02:17.56]It's on how long to be, whatever that first dumb website.
[02:24.46]That's a lie.
[02:28.50]Well, apparently 60 people or whatever, 50 people were pulled, and they're all liars.
[02:38.76]So, we don't even need to do... I don't have to give you an intro.
[02:42.86]Those of you that were here yesterday, if you're here today, we're just going to keep going.
[02:51.62]But with that, I'm going to just let people trickle in before we start, because I don't... You know, I want to make sure that enough people see notifications, and just give me a minute.
[02:59.14]Be back in like a second.
[03:02.66]Okay, so one second has gone by.
[03:03.82]I feel like enough people have trickled in, so let's just turn this over here.
[03:07.77]This popped up when I turned the game on, though.
[03:11.61]So I don't know what this means.
[03:14.57]Am I about to give away my privacy here?
[03:22.53]Do you want to participate in a survey?
[03:25.07]Sure.
[03:25.31]No.
[03:26.23]No way.
[03:28.85]Would you consider having a relationship with an android that looks like a human?
[03:32.33]No.
[03:33.03]I'm sorry about that.
[03:36.65]Here's my reasoning.
[03:43.76]All it takes is one piece of code or somebody to hack the android.
[03:49.60]Somebody to figure out a way to get in their brain.
[03:51.16]And all of a sudden, you're hanging upside down bleeding.
[03:54.78]Because they sacrificed you to their android hacker god.
[03:58.33]No.
[03:58.49]Absolutely.
[04:04.35]I mean, we're talking about automation.
[04:05.83]There's potentially in the next 50 years, no one will have a job because all of them will be done by robots.
[04:11.10]So what's going to happen to all those people?
[04:12.80]Absolute threat to mankind.
[04:15.18]If you had to live on a deserted island and could only bring one object, what would it be?
[04:22.48]Okay, we got a book, a cell phone, pen and paper, a console, an instrument.
[04:28.07]I mean, cell phone, cell phone.
[04:32.20]Pen and paper?
[04:32.92]What are you gonna do?
[04:33.40]Write?
[04:33.82]Are you gonna do the old school?
[04:35.10]Put the... Please help me and put it in a bottle and throw it in the ocean?
[04:39.48]Bullshit.
[04:40.34]You're gonna read a book?
[04:40.96]That's the one book.
[04:41.66]You got one book for the rest of your life.
[04:44.16]You're gonna read, what, Romeo and Juliet 50 times?
[04:47.40]No, no, no.
[04:47.74]Throw that in the ocean.
[04:49.42]An instrument.
[04:49.92]Who are you gonna play that for?
[04:50.76]Yourself?
[04:51.38]No.
[04:51.60]Where's your audience?
[04:53.06]You don't even have electricity.
[04:54.03]How are you gonna plug this in?
[04:56.23]This is the only thing that will work.
[04:57.81]And guess what?
[04:58.43]You hold your hand in the air.
[05:00.23]Oh, and my fucking hand around.
[05:02.13]Oh, I got a bar.
[05:03.91]Yeah.
[05:04.15]Do you consider yourself dependent on technology?
[05:07.40]Maybe.
[05:08.10]Depends on what you mean by that.
[05:09.50]Yeah, probably.
[05:16.88]Yeah, I would say so.
[05:20.82]Yeah, when I swipe my credit card, it's just the money comes out.
[05:23.50]Yeah.
[05:24.03]What technology do you most anticipate?
[05:27.51]Uh... Androids, flying cars, space tourism, brain-connected devices.
[05:35.46]I don't care about space tourism.
[05:37.30]That's a joke.
[05:38.37]I mean, I'd tell you how boring it's going to be up there.
[05:42.52]Oh, I can't wait till, like, they finally, uh, the guy that runs Virgin Atlantic, he's gonna make it so you can take trips to the moon and shit!
[05:49.80]You know, you float around for a little bit, it's like $4,500 million.
[05:54.04]That's not worth it.
[05:55.12]You can watch it on TV and watch a guy eat a banana floating around in space and, like, you'd laugh at it for a second.
[06:00.35]Flying cars, you know how many accidents that's gonna be?
[06:03.93]You wanna get people plane licenses?
[06:05.39]Those people are gonna crash into each other, it's gonna be a disaster.
[06:07.97]Androids, no.
[06:09.37]Brain-connected devices, I wanna be able to download karate like Neo does.
[06:12.38]Do you believe in God?
[06:15.60]Oh, God.
[06:15.96]Oh, okay.
[06:17.42]Hmm.
[06:18.20]This is an interesting question.
[06:21.06]Do you believe in God?
[06:22.99]Hmm.
[06:27.81]Uh-oh.
[06:30.33]Huh.
[06:31.81]This is where you find out some information about me, apparently.
[06:37.49]You know, I'm going to give you two answers here.
[06:41.12]I'm going to say no because... I'm going to say no because a hurricane can wipe through an area and get rid of like tons of people that were innocent people that, you know, may have been God-fearing people.
[06:56.43]So, you know, like natural disasters exist.
[06:58.20]These terrible people exist.
[07:00.92]But on the other hand, on the other hand, just how we are as people, how is that even possible?
[07:10.54]That we are actually... How can you see through your eyes?
[07:16.05]We are such incredible pieces of engineering.
[07:19.59]There's no way it was an accident.
[07:22.01]So, I don't believe in God.
[07:23.85]You know, I believe in aliens.
[07:25.64]I think that aliens came to this planet and had some fucking school project somebody was doing.
[07:30.14]We're talking about a 10 or 11 year old alien.
[07:33.72]Their technology is 500 million light years ahead of ours.
[07:38.46]So we could just be the science fair project for a nine-year-old.
[07:42.71]Is that our god?
[07:46.53]I don't know.
[07:48.21]Would you let an android take care of your children?
[07:50.46]No.
[07:53.06]No.
[07:54.71]How much time per day would you say you spend on an electronic device?
[07:59.20]Uh, 23 hours.
[08:01.14]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:02.22]Okay.
[08:03.00]How much time per day?
[08:03.92]So, when I get up in the morning, I got my, okay, my iPad is usually right next to me when I wake up.
[08:09.54]Because it's right next to me when I go to sleep.
[08:11.20]Because I use it until I fall asleep.
[08:13.06]So, uh, I'd say right when I get up, grab my phone and my iPad and scroll through some Reddits.
[08:21.05]Maybe look at some news for like an hour.
[08:24.28]And then I take Otto out for a walk.
[08:27.43]That's usually like 15, 20 minutes.
[08:29.31]We kind of take a little walk.
[08:31.59]And I come back and open up my phone again for like another four hours.
[08:36.69]And then I go downstairs and I like sit here for about 12 hours.
[08:42.83]No, Divi, let's... I trained for six hours yesterday.
[08:46.89]Yeah, but like this is on average.
[08:49.23]No, I go out, I do errands.
[08:51.83]I'm gonna say four hours.
[08:54.22]If you needed emergency surgery, would you agree to be operated on by a machine?
[08:59.98]I would actually prefer it.
[09:02.18]Yes.
[09:03.50]I would prefer that because they can't fail.
[09:04.58]Do you think one day machines could develop consciousness?
[09:08.28]I don't buy that because consciousness is this thing that we created.
[09:12.84]We made this up.
[09:14.80]Like human beings, the state of consciousness...
[09:19.20]That's not even a real thing.
[09:20.70]It's the same thing.
[09:21.18]It's time as well.
[09:23.04]We made up time.
[09:25.14]Look, guys.
[09:26.06]Sun goes down, the sun goes up.
[09:28.60]That's it.
[09:29.58]January doesn't exist.
[09:31.20]February doesn't exist.
[09:33.85]We've given names to things that never needed them in the first place.
[09:37.71]Sure, we decided, you know, during this period, it's kind of cold outside.
[09:43.33]So let's call that something.
[09:45.41]The world never intended you to do that.
[09:50.10]The same tree is out there that was out there last night.
[09:52.16]That was out there a hundred years ago.
[09:53.82]It has no idea what day it is.
[09:58.22]So, no.
[09:59.18]I think that that's a made-up term.
[10:01.84]Because we're so afraid.
[10:07.97]Okay.
[10:08.73]Let's see the survey results.
[10:11.41]Would you consider having a relationship with an android that looks like a human?
[10:15.25]A lot of people really want sex robots, apparently.
[10:23.62]That's a large portion of yeses.
[10:28.00]Do you think that technology would become a threat to mankind?
[10:30.22]Yes, most of us agree.
[10:32.96]It's true.
[10:34.10]Like I said.
[10:35.96]If you had to live in a deserted island and you could bring one thing, what would you bring?
[10:41.04]A console.
[10:42.16]Why the 13% of people that would bring their PlayStation 4 to a deserted island?
[10:49.59]I mean, I can understand pen and paper because at least you could make some kind of map or notes and leave behind something that you could maybe eventually come help you, give coordinates.
[11:02.39]Fucking console.
[11:04.09]Do you consider yourself dependent on technology?
[11:06.39]Almost 80%.
[11:06.83]Yes.
[11:07.03]What would a cell phone do?
[11:12.02]I got Clash of Clans on my cell phone.
[11:15.11]I could play that for at least two or three hours before the thing dies, and then I could play a game called Frisbee this into the ocean as hard as I can, and see how many times it skips.
[11:23.37]That would be more fun than reading the same book over and over again.
[11:25.73]Uh, yes, everybody is.
[11:29.25]What technology do you most anticipate?
[11:35.72]Isn't it funny that after polling all these PlayStation 4 users...
[11:41.98]The number one answer is sex robots and I can't wait for androids.
[11:48.56]Interesting.
[11:52.07]I wonder why that is.
[11:53.87]Do you believe in God?
[11:54.79]Yes, no, don't know.
[11:55.89]Look at that.
[11:57.75]The demographic is chosen no.
[12:02.59]I went with I don't know, because it could be anything.
[12:05.28]I'm open to all points and talks.
[12:08.24]Would you let an android take care of your children?
[12:10.08]No.
[12:10.60]Somebody said yes.
[12:11.70]A lot of people said yes.
[12:15.02]How much time per day would you say you spend on electronic devices?
[12:18.51]Wow.
[12:22.01]67% said more than four hours.
[12:25.53]We are too dependent on technology.
[12:27.17]Give me that book back.
[12:29.37]If you needed emergency surgery, would you be operated on?
[12:31.35]Yes, machines, they already do that now.
[12:35.99]Do you think one day machines could develop consciousness?
[12:40.65]No, it's... I don't buy that.
[12:44.99]Yes.
[12:46.87]No, they can only develop consciousness if we allow them to, because we programmed them.
[12:52.46]This lady right here was developed in a 3D modeling program and then given a set of instructions to do.
[13:01.27]That was fun.
[13:04.45]Oh, Jesus.
[13:04.65]I kind of like this weird lady.
[13:15.37]That goes into your personal life.
[13:18.42]You had 42 porn tabs open last night.
[13:22.06]Can't wait for those sex androids, huh, Jeremy?
[13:25.44]No, no, delete it!
[13:26.30]Delete it!
[13:42.09]Go out with her.
[13:45.01]Yeah, so we're gonna go right where we left off.
[13:47.51]We'll be down in Jericho with all the androids that have become deviant, a.k.a.
[13:55.05]free-thinking.
[14:00.18]We might have to redo this section here, if that's okay.
[14:05.20]Wait, 513, is it keeping track of my actual time?
[14:08.18]What time is it?
[14:09.89]Fugitives.
[14:10.65]That's 10 minutes ago.
[14:11.37]Just like you.
[14:12.63]My name is Josh.
[14:13.57]How long was I in the, uh... I was, okay, I was in... I was in that survey for 13 minutes.
[14:21.79]It's a refuge for those who don't want to be slaves anymore.
[14:24.42]I've been streaming for 14 minutes.
[14:29.96]Hiding just to stay alive.
[14:31.62]That's freedom to you?
[14:32.92]Humans hate us.
[14:34.92]Hiding is the only way we can survive.
[14:36.90]There is no safe place for those like us.
[14:40.10]If humans knew we were here, they'd kill us.
[14:45.51]I don't understand.
[14:46.29]I thought Jericho was a place where androids lived in freedom.
[14:49.19]We are.
[14:49.47]We do live in freedom.
[14:51.45]Isn't that wonderful?
[14:52.19]It may not be what you hoped for, but here we have no master.
[14:55.09]We don't belong to anybody.
[14:56.11]Yeah, it's great.
[14:57.59]There's plenty of dumpster fires.
[15:00.31]But we have more freedom here than you ever did.
[15:02.03]Darkness.
[15:03.85]It's great.
[15:06.72]I came to Jericho looking for hope.
[15:10.06]It's wonderful.
[15:10.44]We stand around on the sides of the building.
[15:12.08]I love it.
[15:12.58]He's right.
[15:12.88]Yeah, why do they need a heat source?
[15:15.48]They don't... They don't need to be warmed up.
[15:18.10]They're pretend.
[15:20.07]She might be able to help you.
[15:41.15]Let's go see Lucy.
[15:47.05]Settle in.
[15:47.49]Find Lucy.
[15:48.03]Explore Jericho.
[15:48.81]Alright, let's take a little bit of exploring.
[15:51.02]Light the fire.
[15:52.78]The biggest fire the North has ever seen.
[15:57.14]Alright.
[16:00.08]Yeah, we already did these jokes.
[16:01.48]I can't do them again.
[16:03.03]If you're a VOD watcher, just fast forward.
[16:08.73]Alright, let's see what's around here.
[16:09.77]We got... Lucy... There's just random people everywhere.
[16:15.32]Just talk to this guy.
[16:19.66]Hey.
[16:19.80]I'm not in very good shape, am I?
[16:26.58]This guy kind of looks like Pinocchio.
[16:28.50]Looks like he's made out of wood and tarnish.
[16:30.05]My diagnostic program isn't working.
[16:35.23]Boy, I don't think you would have anything good to say.
[16:37.47]Mm-hmm.
[16:38.63]No starts to lengthen when he doesn't lie He tied me to the back of a car I think they wanted to have fun.
[16:49.07]I Don't want to shut down so don't stay on So don't do it just stay on
[17:04.76]I couldn't really interact with him we already did this one remember this one yeah I remember this one I'm gonna do it just because humans are afraid of dying too I need to probably talk to everybody around here do you know what happens after death just stay on how long have you how long has your computer been on for no I don't
[17:31.17]I'm one of those people that doesn't like to keep their computer on I turn it off pretty much every night what's your name but some of you guys probably had your computer turned on for like a year I don't want to die so don't well they're machines
[18:01.79]Eternal sleep mode.
[18:06.67]Alright, call me crazy, but... Apparently these guys have all been down here for a long time, and they're all just shutting off when I come to say hello to them.
[18:16.93]Lucy?
[18:19.78]Lucy!
[18:21.44]Lucy, you have some splattin' to do!
[18:26.66]Oh, Ricky!
[18:27.14]Ricky!
[18:30.13]Get out of the fucking way.
[18:31.56]I wanna go up and see Lucy.
[18:42.70]Lucy, I'm home!
[18:51.83]That was pretty good.
[18:58.85]Didn't think I was gonna be hit those.
[19:07.13]They threw him out when they didn't want him anymore.
[19:10.99]He was living on the streets before we brought him here.
[19:14.87]They'll all shut down if we don't find a way to help them.
[19:17.89]To help them, we need blue blood and biocomponents.
[19:20.92]We salvage what we can from those who shut down.
[19:22.94]Take some of mine.
[19:23.60]Take some of my blood.
[19:24.22]Take it.
[19:24.58]But there's never enough.
[19:26.54]So, how do they survive?
[19:30.00]They won't.
[19:33.00]We're slowly dying out.
[19:34.18]Let's get some
[19:36.94]blood it's not that hard just get some every every one of my solutions for you know dying off is just don't do that we're dying down here don't do that we need blood get some I don't want to shut down so don't do that I think I have to light all the fires
[20:10.83]That makes sense, right?
[20:18.22]Lucy's probably the one that's singing.
[20:19.30]Alright, that kind of scared me a little.
[20:25.98]There's only two more people to really talk to than the people down here.
[20:28.52]I think that's probably Lucy.
[20:31.62]The one that just threw the cigarette?
[20:33.74]Oh no.
[20:34.42]That's a... That's a fun ball.
[20:36.89]That's not a cigarette.
[20:38.67]Here we go.
[20:40.50]Name's North.
[20:45.56]Is Tim here?
[20:46.24]How long have you been here?
[20:50.21]Four weeks, three days, 11 hours.
[20:54.55]When I escaped, there was nowhere else to go.
[20:58.51]Jericho seemed as good a place as any.
[21:02.13]You know, that's actually pretty fun what she's doing.
[21:04.53]These guys need spare parts and blue blood.
[21:06.57]Why hasn't anybody gone to get that?
[21:11.99]It's not that simple.
[21:12.77]You don't think we've tried, newbie?
[21:13.81]You can't just go shopping at a CyberLife store.
[21:18.29]Anyway, nobody wants to risk leaving Jericho.
[21:22.25]Uh, what about you?
[21:24.23]What was your function before coming here?
[21:28.89]What do you care?
[21:33.18]I wish there was an option for... Can I play with that?
[21:37.42]You came here for comfort.
[21:38.42]You came to the wrong place.
[21:42.21]My.
[21:43.49]My toy.
[21:49.95]Well.
[21:52.63]Man, does that fucking irritate you at all?
[21:54.90]Can't see, can you?
[21:55.82]Oh, wait.
[21:57.36]She's not a human.
[21:59.94]Alright, we got some other people over here.
[22:03.30]We got one of the X-Men.
[22:07.29]I don't know who this is, but he's in his X-Men suit.
[22:11.26]and uh I don't know who else these people are that's not lucy alright there was something over here wasn't there apparently not -2 for my x-van reference there's something over here uh should I do I just light all the fires
[22:49.38]Okay, there's something over here too.
[22:51.36]Open this up.
[22:54.00]Crate already emptied.
[22:56.02]Did I take too long to open this or something?
[23:01.75]Cyberlife.
[23:03.97]This is where the blood came from, maybe.
[23:06.53]Cyberlife Warehouse and Docks, West Torrance Avenue, Detroit, Michigan.
[23:13.49]Calculating route.
[23:16.75]There is a toll here.
[23:18.17]Do you still want to do it?
[23:20.50]Yes.
[23:21.60]I do.
[23:25.70]So which one of you is Lucy?
[23:31.02]One of you is Lucy, and I apparently have not figured out who you are.
[23:34.67]You?
[23:36.23]You're the singing one.
[23:37.73]Are you singing?
[23:38.37]No.
[23:41.57]In the back room.
[23:43.57]Found her.
[23:48.57]Whoa, her head's off.
[23:56.97]Oh, yeah.
[23:58.72]You have your beautiful, like, sex robot guys, right?
[24:01.92]Can't wait.
[24:02.78]That's what they look like with their heads off.
[24:07.32]Oh, my handsome sex robot.
[24:09.10]That guy's skull was off.
[24:09.95]Look at that.
[24:11.83]That look good to you?
[24:32.65]People also look pretty bad with their heads off.
[24:37.15]Yeah.
[24:38.23]Yeah, they do.
[24:42.55]What would you look like with your back of your head off?
[24:48.89]Probably way worse.
[24:51.93]In fact, that actually doesn't look that bad, considering.
[24:56.01]I love blue Powerade, my favorite.
[25:08.83]Mmm.
[25:15.75]Yellow's the best Gatorade, uh, if you want heartburn all day.
[25:21.54]Give me your hand.
[25:22.98]Don't you guys know the only Gatorades you should be drinking are blue and red?
[25:27.66]Orange and yellow give guaranteed heartburn for the rest of the day.
[25:40.88]What's going on here?
[25:43.55]You had it all.
[25:45.95]And you lost it all.
[25:49.23]You've seen hell and now hell lives in you.
[25:53.40]Had it all, lost it all.
[25:57.40]You went to Vegas.
[26:00.58]That was a mistake.
[26:02.04]Your bank account was drained, though.
[26:16.41]Choices, you mean... Your anchor point in the story going forward, linear, will make sure everybody else's choices make sense later?
[26:24.76]Alright, propose a plan to Simon.
[26:26.58]Simon.
[26:36.05]I have an idea.
[26:39.17]Simon.
[26:42.38]There we go.
[27:12.56]There we go.
[27:13.18]There we go.
[27:15.24]Dude, I just did a big AOE buff right there.
[27:19.72]Perfect.
[27:20.16]Big AOE choice.
[27:22.79]That hit everybody in the team.
[27:31.03]You know that there's a slight problem when there are no choices to make here.
[27:41.52]So I did the thing that you never shouldn't have done.
[27:44.18]I did the talk to everybody instead of just go talk to Lucy and get out of this as soon as possible.
[27:48.92]I talked to every single person.
[27:53.93]Well.
[27:55.91]Alright.
[27:56.43]Moving on to an interesting storyline.
[27:59.57]Where are we?
[28:00.95]Ah, here you are.
[28:02.43]Like choices?
[28:03.19]You like fun?
[28:04.55]Stick around.
[28:05.01]You gonna be okay?
[28:13.05]What class did I main?
[28:13.99]I mained Connor.
[28:16.39]He's definitely the best.
[28:17.25]Kara's a very close second.
[28:40.71]Gonna steal some more money?
[28:42.63]I hope so.
[28:45.07]Why would I hope that?
[28:45.77]Hmm, find help.
[28:53.30]Find help at Luigi's Mansion.
[28:56.64]Why did somebody say Luigi's Mansion?
[28:59.66]This is not even close to Luigi's Mansion.
[29:04.96]This is more late 90s horror movie.
[29:07.39]Old lady that knows too much house.
[29:12.22]and somehow was involved in the plot that you find out an hour later.
[29:14.76]Come on.
[29:22.44]Now that's too bad.
[29:23.04]Is this a fatter version of the guy we ran away from?
[29:26.64]With a beard?
[29:51.06]Look at that painting on the wall.
[29:52.00]You can already tell it's going to be a dangerous place.
[30:00.37]Yeah, please come in.
[30:01.69]As you can tell, I'm also fucking weird.
[30:04.03]Remember that old guy in the first game that had all the weird shit and the giraffes and stuff and the birds and funny paintings?
[30:09.62]I have one of those houses, too.
[30:11.66]Come on in and sit down.
[30:12.50]Luther, would you be so kind as to take these ladies' coats?
[30:17.92]Oh, don't be afraid of our big friend here.
[30:21.48]Luther is just another android that I helped.
[30:25.24]He keeps me company in this big, empty old house.
[30:28.82]This guy is huge.
[30:37.83]Please, make yourselves at home.
[30:50.68]How did you hear about me?
[30:52.76]An android.
[30:54.58]Told us to come live here.
[30:55.52]On the street, he said you could help us.
[30:58.28]God damn it, he's freaking Scotch, isn't he?
[31:00.51]I see.
[31:00.69]He had the clink in the glass.
[31:05.45]It's a tin glass, too.
[31:08.05]Deviant, huh?
[31:11.26]What about her?
[31:15.32]Can I lie here?
[31:15.92]She's human.
[31:22.43]And you want to find a safe place.
[31:27.53]Somewhere you can start a new life.
[31:30.86]I hear Canada is very lovely at this time of year.
[31:34.38]Weren't all androids banned?
[31:35.04]Beautiful landscapes.
[31:37.06]Open spaces.
[31:38.42]Clean air.
[31:40.26]And no android laws.
[31:43.63]Great place for a fresh start.
[31:45.53]I thought it was Canada you couldn't go to Canada.
[31:47.33]Yes, that's... That's exactly what we want.
[31:51.39]Of course.
[31:52.63]It's November.
[31:54.77]I can help you.
[31:56.29]But first, we have to get rid of your tracker.
[31:58.73]Tracker?
[31:59.47]Yeah.
[32:00.27]All androids are fitted with a tracking device to locate them at all times.
[32:05.37]I'll remove yours, and then you'll both be safe.
[32:10.07]Come on.
[32:10.53]That's how funny I like it.
[32:11.41]Follow me.
[32:12.93]I'm moving to Canada.
[32:13.87]Hold on, wait.
[32:16.44]A Democrat got elected?
[32:17.86]That's it, I'm moving to fucking Canada.
[32:19.30]You're never gonna see me again.
[32:21.65]Was that a Republican got elected?
[32:23.47]Oh, you'll never see me again.
[32:24.63]I'm moving to Canada.
[32:25.73]Everything we need is in the basement.
[32:26.83]And they write, like, a five-page blog post about it, and then a week later, you see them in the same grocery store, and they're like, oh, hey, what's up?
[32:34.17]Hey, uh, what are you up to?
[32:36.71]Oh, nothing.
[32:36.99]I thought you were, like, moving to Canada because you, like, hated everything here.
[32:39.82]Uh, I mean, like, I haven't thought about it.
[32:41.26]I, like, packed my bags, but, like, I missed my plane, so I didn't leave.
[32:45.42]I'm, like, still here, though.
[32:46.22]Like, whatever.
[33:07.81]No, that's not breaking my own rules.
[33:09.05]I'm just talking.
[33:10.31]That's an observation on both sides.
[33:11.95]I like this place and that man.
[33:14.43]Let's go.
[33:14.85]I have a bad feeling.
[33:18.55]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[33:19.51]Comfort.
[33:20.35]Comfort.
[33:22.44]He's a bit odd, but I think we can trust him.
[33:27.02]We don't have much of a choice anyway.
[33:30.56]I don't like this.
[33:31.24]Please excuse the mess.
[33:32.14]This is weird.
[33:33.42]I don't like coming down here.
[33:34.44]I needed somewhere to scrape for my machines.
[33:38.19]This is like a stable down here.
[33:43.97]What was that?
[33:47.15]Alright, you just gave me like a point of exit.
[33:51.22]I don't know if I like this.
[33:54.16]Follow.
[33:54.94]Checked on Alice.
[33:55.88]There's got to be something else I can do here.
[33:57.34]Can I like unlock a certain door?
[34:02.72]Who am I?
[34:09.15]I thought I just turned into the juggernaut over there for a second.
[34:14.99]Uh... Oh, no.
[34:17.23]I don't know if I like this.
[34:19.75]If you could just stand over there.
[34:24.16]Uh... I've seen this movie before.
[34:26.96]I don't think I want to step in there.
[34:34.94]Fuck it.
[34:35.22]Let's do it.
[34:48.29]I should warn you, this could be quite unpleasant.
[34:56.12]Not even a 3, 2, 1 dude?
[34:58.00]Really?
[34:59.12]Come on.
[35:00.52]That wasn't that nice.
[35:06.04]You know what's strange?
[35:07.40]I knew I shouldn't have trusted this guy.
[35:10.52]For some unknown reason, the trackers seem to stop working in Deviants.
[35:16.85]That's why it's so hard to find them.
[35:20.21]So, actually, there's no reason to remove your tracker.
[35:23.91]I knew it.
[35:24.33]He's a liar.
[35:24.97]You said that... Yeah.
[35:27.37]People believe what they want.
[35:29.03]God damn it.
[35:31.03]You Deviants are so naive.
[35:36.26]They'll come to me expecting me to help them.
[35:38.74]Quick, Caitlin, go smash all the buttons over there as hard as you can.
[35:41.50]Reset them.
[35:42.93]Sell them all.
[35:45.07]Or I keep them for my little experiments.
[35:47.29]What a dick.
[35:48.13]No!
[35:49.13]Noah!
[35:49.77]I don't want to be reset!
[35:50.93]Let me go!
[35:54.11]I forgot about the child.
[35:57.56]No, no!
[35:59.28]Lock it up.
[36:00.24]I'll deal with it later.
[36:01.08]Alice!
[36:01.52]Alice!
[36:03.65]Why did we do this?
[36:04.57]We shouldn't have done this.
[36:06.01]I knew you... You can never trust the slick-backed hair, fat guy with a beard.
[36:10.65]I got something I can do, right?
[36:18.76]Scan him.
[36:26.01]Reset.
[36:26.85]Reset.
[36:29.29]Can I, like, jump into his head?
[36:30.65]Can I, like, take over his consciousness?
[36:33.31]Preparing memory wipe.
[36:34.25]There's nothing I can do.
[36:38.11]Bite him!
[36:38.55]Can I bite his face?
[36:39.35]Is there anything I can look at here?
[36:43.07]Use the force.
[36:58.15]This is not where my story ends with this, right?
[37:01.27]It's only 10%.
[37:01.99]It's alright.
[37:03.31]I only forgot about my first 10 years.
[37:04.93]She bit him.
[37:07.93]Go do it!
[37:09.42]Smash the buttons!
[37:27.14]Just go play the piano over there, even if you don't know how, just pretend.
[37:30.32]Come on, do something.
[37:43.43]What?
[37:45.69]How am I supposed to do that?
[37:46.63]I'm currently plugged into a machine that is sucking my brain juice out.
[37:54.51]Find a way to escape, okay.
[37:57.51]We've got computers over here.
[38:00.13]Calls a short circuit.
[38:05.13]Okay, we get green cable, yellow cable.
[38:06.95]It's the green cable.
[38:08.05]That's what's being plugged in here.
[38:10.26]Cut the green cable.
[38:18.04]Pull it up.
[38:21.04]Yank it!
[38:27.32]Did I do it?
[38:29.10]I don't think I did it.
[38:29.70]What else do I need to do?
[38:31.64]67%- Oh, pa- Oh, go, go, go, go!
[38:33.92]Where's the- What's the blue cable for?
[38:36.66]Just rip it out!
[38:37.24]I don't know, rip it out, rip it out!
[38:42.43]Rip out the blue cable, quick!
[38:46.07]Huh?
[38:49.85]What are you doing?
[38:56.42]Push this!
[38:59.57]Damn it, Cage!
[39:40.87]Fucking, what is this, a goddamn Wiimote?
[39:44.59]Is this a Wiimote, David?
[39:53.42]Throw your hands in the air with your controller in your hands.
[39:56.88]Remember 2008?
[39:57.24]Wasn't that fun?
[39:58.34]Help us.
[40:05.89]If only I'd slept in the fucking car.
[40:11.20]He erased her memory.
[40:16.26]No.
[40:17.92]This can't be happening.
[40:22.07]You have to remember.
[40:24.89]For her sake.
[40:27.03]He likes to play with us.
[40:30.75]Creating monsters for his amusement.
[40:37.77]But who's the real monster?
[40:40.14]Ripping cords out with Wiimote controls.
[40:51.68]You must remember who you are.
[40:54.30]It's Toy Story.
[40:55.26]Otherwise the little one will die.
[40:56.72]Alright, now we gotta go into our conscious and find the memory.
[41:07.75]I wonder what combination of holding L2, R2, and turning my hand upside down I'll have to do this time.
[41:12.33]Let's go meet the guy in the living room.
[41:21.09]What the hell is that?
[41:29.69]That guy's just like sitting there.
[41:44.96]Okay, we're gonna serve this guy.
[41:46.54]Actually, I'm kind of glad I did this.
[41:48.10]Look at this.
[41:52.90]See, I'm gonna remember anyways.
[41:54.26]It doesn't even matter.
[41:54.90]I remember the scissors when I cut my hair.
[42:04.13]My name.
[42:05.69]My name is... Anything else I can jog my memory with?
[42:18.39]Look at the coat, right?
[42:24.20]Mm-hmm.
[42:30.70]My name's Jeff.
[42:34.98]My name's Jeff.
[42:36.98]Oh, God.
[42:38.28]Alright, hold on.
[42:38.82]Wait, wait, wait.
[42:41.50]Jog my memory again.
[42:42.36]I can remember him opening the door and us coming in.
[42:50.42]Apparently.
[42:50.86]No, I'm not.
[42:52.30]Can I go upstairs?
[42:55.32]Wait, now I remember.
[42:56.00]I can look at the books.
[43:02.91]Then I'm going to remember going over here.
[43:10.99]More stuff to look at.
[43:12.81]Luther's great-grandfather.
[43:14.09]Again, look.
[43:15.43]I like putting big animals in my house.
[43:20.09]And funnily enough, this guy has the bird giraffe.
[43:23.21]The ostrich is in here.
[43:26.81]Same exact animal, just different species.
[43:30.13]Long ass neck.
[43:31.85]Runs around, makes a bunch of fucked up noises.
[43:34.51]Biggest of its kind.
[43:39.48]What have we got?
[43:40.16]Anything else I can do?
[43:42.20]Can I poison it or something?
[43:47.52]Nothing else I can do in here?
[43:51.29]I didn't... I didn't degauss the hard drive?
[43:59.79]What?
[44:07.08]Well, where is he?
[44:08.44]What is he eating?
[44:08.98]I need to look at it.
[44:11.54]More books.
[44:12.68]History of Art.
[44:15.70]Houses of the Century.
[44:19.37]This guy's real wacko.
[44:28.15]Anything else I can do?
[44:28.99]Is there like a window I can open?
[44:30.19]Or a sneak outer?
[44:30.85]Is this guy eating potato chips for dinner?
[44:36.05]Hold on.
[44:38.37]This guy's eating two different kinds of potato chips.
[44:42.21]Alright.
[44:43.43]Let's go over this fucking dinner for a second here.
[44:46.68]Two different kinds of potato chips.
[44:49.37]Two cookies.
[44:52.19]Sandwich with no bread.
[44:54.96]No, sandwich with only bread.
[44:57.84]And a papaya.
[45:01.08]No wonder this guy's so fucked up.
[45:02.36]He's not even getting the proper nutrients to have his brain function properly.
[45:11.25]On a silver plate.
[45:12.21]What else is this?
[45:16.69]Cigarettes?
[45:20.39]And you want to find a safe place?
[45:24.47]Boneless sandwich.
[45:25.43]Somewhere you can start a new life.
[45:27.83]Bread and a sandwich?
[45:28.97]Alright, I'm starting to remember.
[45:34.17]Okay.
[45:40.27]So now we go upstairs.
[45:44.67]Sandwich with only bread is just bread.
[45:46.15]Why would you have potato chips and bread?
[45:49.65]And two cookies for dinner.
[45:50.99]There's no nutritional value there.
[45:52.81]You're eating starch, oil, and carbs.
[45:58.49]There's nothing in there.
[46:01.43]Can I hide something in these potato chips?
[46:03.03]Can I sprinkle some turmeric on these so at least it gets some kind of supplement?
[46:09.33]Is he in here?
[46:12.69]No.
[46:12.87]Nope.
[46:13.21]Is he doing something to the- Oh, I thought he was like taking the girl apart.
[46:18.30]There might be something else I can do, though.
[46:21.57]No, okay.
[46:28.29]Let's get somebody else on the table here.
[46:36.58]Oil for the machine.
[46:38.94]No, you don't want oil.
[46:43.56]I can't do anything else.
[46:46.74]Just making sure before I start the next cutscene that I... ...can't interact with anything.
[46:58.17]I mean, maybe, like, olive oil.
[46:59.91]I'll get rid of that carcass.
[47:03.39]Uh, take it next door.
[47:12.28]Did you hear what I said?
[47:14.14]Yes, Slotko.
[47:18.14]Okay, food brought.
[47:18.78]Bring the carcass next door.
[47:20.64]This thing is going to start talking to me.
[47:27.63]And an empty Capri Sun.
[47:32.61]Luther!
[47:34.91]Luther?
[47:36.83]Luther?
[47:38.20]Yes, Larko?
[47:39.97]I should be done here in 10 minutes or so.
[47:42.09]Have a look at the little one, see what I can do with it.
[47:44.09]I can't even.
[47:44.87]Never mind.
[47:45.39]I'll bring you the little one in 10 minutes.
[47:48.70]I got 10 minutes to figure this out.
[47:50.10]Fuck.
[47:50.60]Okay.
[47:51.34]Time to put it into action mode.
[47:53.00]Alright, quickly.
[47:55.22]I gotta figure out who I am in 10 minutes.
[48:02.61]Who is the little girl?
[48:04.39]Remember.
[48:05.97]Remember.
[48:06.41]Remember.
[48:12.40]Bring yourself back online.
[48:15.44]Right here.
[48:16.74]Observe.
[48:19.25]Just breathe it in.
[48:20.43]Maybe it'll help you remember.
[48:21.39]I'm doing a good job remembering this guy, not the girl, though.
[48:30.26]I forgot I got my name.
[48:37.06]No, that's it.
[48:39.16]I figured it out.
[48:40.52]Okay, got it.
[48:41.89]Hey!
[48:44.19]We don't even need to do anything else.
[48:46.39]I told you I said to breathe in the butane and I'd be fine.
[48:48.51]Alright.
[48:52.15]Time to find Alice.
[48:59.41]He's in sleep mode.
[49:00.25]Whoa.
[49:05.05]Remember.
[49:11.64]Okay, so how can I corrupt his mind?
[49:16.12]I can't Professor X this guy?
[49:18.34]Now, who is the reverse Professor X?
[49:20.70]What was his name?
[49:25.24]The guy in the movie where he was like, he could control everybody's brain?
[49:30.23]All I remember is, Jason, stop it!
[49:32.63]What was his name?
[49:35.31]Okay, I don't have time to read.
[49:36.65]Put this down.
[49:42.72]Not Magneto.
[49:43.18]Alright, where is she?
[49:54.58]I've got eight minutes to find her.
[49:59.78]Don't check the fire.
[50:01.00]She's not in the fire.
[50:02.95]She's not in the fire.
[50:04.29]That's not her.
[50:05.67]If it was, that would be a really fucked up video game.
[50:07.81]Okay.
[50:08.90]This is the stuff to help you remember.
[50:11.08]I don't need to remember anymore.
[50:12.44]I know where she is.
[50:14.52]Stop turning on TVs!
[50:18.58]Oh my god, I don't need to see, like, a reenactment of the Civil War.
[50:21.66]Can we please get out of here?
[50:23.94]Stop looking at TVs, just go to the room she's in.
[50:34.26]Luther was gonna go get her.
[50:40.02]Okay, when is Luther gonna go get her?
[50:43.62]He says yes, I'll get her in 10 minutes.
[50:44.98]I was gonna go in front of him.
[50:48.54]Stare at the mirror.
[50:49.32]I don't know what room she's in.
[50:54.25]I missed the gun.
[50:58.61]Is she in this one?
[51:02.53]That's not her.
[51:03.69]Oh, shut up.
[51:04.01]This is not her.
[51:04.51]Get me out of here.
[51:06.31]Get me out of here.
[51:07.21]I need to go downstairs.
[51:10.47]I don't know.
[51:10.87]I have eight, seven minutes.
[51:36.96]She's going to die.
[51:38.14]She's not going to die.
[51:41.60]There's one door here.
[51:43.24]I don't think I went in this.
[51:49.32]OK.
[51:50.36]And Alice, I'm here to take you out of here.
[51:54.41]Alice.
[52:01.71]I remember you.
[52:02.99]Yes, of course I do.
[52:04.17]How could I forget you?
[52:07.84]I'm so sorry.
[52:09.88]You were right.
[52:10.38]We never should have come here.
[52:14.81]We have to go.
[52:15.35]Now we're going to do a bunch of quick time.
[52:17.43]Oh, no.
[52:17.77]You're going to give me a choice at the end of this, and I don't know what I'm going to do.
[52:21.41]Alright.
[52:22.01]We've got to walk out the front door.
[52:26.24]Now, obviously, let me tell you something.
[52:28.14]The most subtle you can be.
[52:36.10]Oh no, we have to avoid Luther.
[52:38.90]Okay.
[52:39.68]Oh, okay, okay.
[52:42.20]We gotta... Come in here.
[52:44.96]In here.
[52:46.70]Get in the fire.
[52:47.36]It's safe.
[52:50.28]No, don't get in the fire.
[52:51.82]Underneath the table.
[52:52.52]Come on.
[52:52.72]I can't look anywhere.
[52:58.30]If I let go of this...
[53:07.47]Goddammit, my fingers are so sweaty.
[53:11.47]I'm sweating profusely right now.
[53:12.85]I can't let go of this.
[53:15.12]Oh my god, he's gonna walk right by.
[53:21.40]Just be quiet.
[53:23.80]He's gonna... Okay, where is he?
[53:30.03]Oh my god.
[53:30.91]Please don't see me under here.
[53:42.88]Okay, here he goes.
[53:44.04]Okay.
[53:51.71]One, two, three.
[53:55.23]What?
[53:56.09]Wait, why?
[53:57.83]What the fuck?
[54:00.81]He wasn't even over here.
[54:01.95]He went the complete other direction.
[54:06.79]Ah, to the bedroom.
[54:10.87]He wasn't even in here.
[54:13.52]Oh shit!
[54:15.38]That's a gun?
[54:20.20]Oh no, we're stuck.
[54:21.48]Oh god, what do I do?
[54:23.64]Use the body!
[54:24.76]What about the girl?
[54:26.84]What about the girl?
[54:27.38]Oh my god.
[54:29.56]Is he not aware we're here?
[54:31.74]I don't think he knows where we are.
[54:43.27]Head.
[54:44.05]Smash.
[54:44.37]Take the gun.
[54:46.49]Shoot him in the face.
[54:51.44]Woah!
[54:52.54]Missed it.
[54:54.20]Missed it.
[54:57.16]Dude!
[55:04.13]It's two against one.
[55:05.05]It's not fair.
[55:13.34]Out the front door, let's go!
[55:14.48]How many bullets do you have?
[55:23.16]Oh my god, where do we go?
[55:25.40]Uh, back door, back door, back door, back door, back door!
[55:33.19]That was useless, that just added more time!
[55:42.35]It's just like Michael Myers, man.
[55:43.37]All you have to do is just move faster than Michael Myers and you're gonna get away.
[55:45.87]Go, Alice!
[55:46.45]No!
[55:47.07]I won't leave!
[55:48.41]He's walking very slowly.
[55:50.38]Just run together.
[55:51.40]Oh, God.
[55:55.46]I warned you.
[55:57.32]Dreams always end in tears.
[56:00.42]You should have listened to me.
[56:01.44]Come on, Palpatine him.
[56:03.24]Palpatine him, Vader.
[56:05.44]Palpatine him, Vader.
[56:06.56]What are you doing?
[56:09.66]Get out of my way.
[56:11.54]No.
[56:13.26]Not this time.
[56:14.94]I said get out of my way or I'll shoot right through you.
[56:18.98]Get it?
[56:19.82]How dare you?
[56:23.41]Oh wait, he's got a bunch of zombies?
[56:28.69]Oh no, they make velociraptor noises too.
[56:32.19]Get away from me!
[56:33.99]Get away from me!
[56:35.59]He's gonna get eaten.
[56:36.42]Obey me!
[56:36.92]I'm your master!
[56:38.34]I'm your master!
[56:47.64]The raptor, the raptor androids.
[56:50.40]Look at the guy in the back, he was even doing the T-Rex arms.
[56:55.17]Hey, thanks.
[57:06.83]I didn't want to hurt you.
[57:09.83]He programmed me to obey him.
[57:13.80]When I saw the little one risk her life to save you,
[57:18.17]It was like opening my eyes for the first time.
[57:21.45]Finally, I could see.
[57:22.43]I know you have no reason to trust me after what I did.
[57:28.53]Oh, no, Luther.
[57:29.03]Please come with us.
[57:29.69]Please.
[57:31.47]But I know someone who could help you across the border.
[57:34.07]Look, you come with us.
[57:36.83]I could take you there.
[57:37.81]Yes.
[57:38.35]Yes.
[57:38.87]Please.
[57:39.39]I could protect you.
[57:40.33]Yes.
[57:41.67]You and the little one.
[57:42.75]Yes, you could.
[57:44.53]Sign me up.
[57:45.41]Now.
[57:49.15]Alright.
[57:52.39]I trust you.
[57:54.47]Party member added, Luther the Humongous.
[57:58.89]I was so scared of losing you.
[58:14.04]You don't want the biggest guy that has been in the game so far to protect us?
[58:18.79]Oh god.
[58:20.87]Oh my god.
[58:24.42]That's a lot.
[58:25.20]There's a lot going on in this chapter.
[58:30.12]Alright, so let's take a look.
[58:34.73]Everybody starts here.
[58:38.06]Kara is reset.
[58:39.78]Okay, so we're climbing the machine.
[58:42.00]Kara is being reset.
[58:44.40]54% of the people that played got David caged.
[58:46.08]So that's what happens.
[58:47.34]Sometimes you can't get over it.
[58:48.81]It's alright.
[58:49.11]You can go obey your new master.
[58:50.81]54%.
[58:50.83]Go see Luther.
[58:55.03]Free monsters.
[58:56.41]Most people did that.
[59:00.47]Bathroom android is loud.
[59:02.29]Enter the bathroom.
[59:06.29]Down here, recall offering coat.
[59:10.17]Yeah, look at how many, the fireplaces down here, all the random things to remember your memory, they're all down here.
[59:17.66]But, okay, oddly enough, if you don't, okay, if you escape, you go all the way down here to find Alice.
[59:34.00]Can you not recover your memory?
[59:38.87]Look, I think you can end the game here.
[59:41.71]If you don't recover your memory, what, you could just stay there forever?
[59:48.53]Interesting.
[59:49.03]Alright.
[59:49.79]And then you find Alice.
[59:50.87]Most people do.
[59:52.99]Hide under the table.
[59:55.48]Fairly large amount of people do that.
[59:56.98]Get spotted.
[59:58.42]I wonder how many people got David caged here.
[60:02.02]Probably at least 75% of us.
[60:06.42]Chase ends up starting.
[60:11.25]Which then brings... I guess you can just die here.
[60:15.77]You can just get shot by the shotgun and die.
[60:19.88]Interesting.
[60:22.18]And which leads us to Luther joins Kara and Alice.
[60:27.08]So it seems like there are a couple of places where you can just hit the wall with the story.
[60:31.72]And maybe this is the end here if you get caught.
[60:37.58]Interesting.
[60:39.80]Recover what you didn't lose.
[60:43.62]Well.
[60:45.66]There you go.
[60:49.64]Hey, here we go.
[60:52.47]Back to Connor.
[60:58.85]Back on the mini golf course.
[60:59.81]We're going to go.
[61:00.57]I'm assuming talk to Amanda.
[61:03.59]Right here.
[61:14.76]Honestly, I would have played a game that was just Connor.
[61:19.79]Give me some third-person action sequences with some combat.
[61:23.85]I would have called this a great game.
[61:25.05]I mean, I already am having a good time, but... Connor the android should get his own spin-off.
[61:29.62]Hello, Amanda.
[61:31.14]Connor, I've been expecting you.
[61:34.54]Would you mind a little walk?
[61:46.71]Wasn't it just supposed to be Connor?
[61:49.35]What did they change ideas halfway through or something?
[61:52.93]Well, uh, they're doing, I'm going to say birds.
[62:00.42]Well, no, the signs on the walls are more important.
[62:02.30]What else?
[62:14.91]A lot of birds.
[62:15.85]I mean, that's... I was fascinated by that, too.
[62:18.67]Oh.
[62:18.77]What?
[62:40.48]Something sparked.
[62:41.49]Well, how was I supposed to save him?
[62:42.85]I watched him eat a rotten hamburger.
[62:44.33]Not good.
[62:44.73]It's improving.
[62:45.71]Last time we saw Hank, it was improving.
[63:11.00]don't have much time deviancy continues to spread it's only a matter of time before the media finds out about it we need to stop this whatever it takes I will solve this investigation Amanda I won't disappoint you a new case just came in find anderson and investigate it he's actively hostile to you you idiot um do you remember the hamburger scene
[63:39.88]He understands.
[63:41.12]He fell off a fucking roof.
[63:44.40]That doesn't mean that we're not... We have an improving relationship.
[63:47.54]Before it was really bad.
[63:48.72]Now... It's better.
[63:50.36]That was before.
[63:53.84]That doesn't matter.
[63:56.26]You can't erase the memories you had with somebody regardless if they let you fall off a roof.
[64:08.42]Hank is hostile.
[64:20.29]Is he gonna attack me on sight?
[64:21.69]I don't want Connor to die.
[64:22.77]He's my favorite character.
[64:26.71]Should I climb in his window?
[64:27.87]He's gonna be mad at me.
[64:30.05]Let's go in his window.
[64:30.87]Because then we can at least prove to him that we're sneaking.
[64:34.52]He'll like us for that.
[64:39.60]He's gonna kill me.
[64:40.48]Oh no.
[64:41.28]No, that's not how it works, right?
[64:44.98]If I break in his window and I sneak in his house... He'll have no... He'll have no other choice but to trust me.
[65:01.63]I don't know... Hold on.
[65:04.25]Can I go around?
[65:04.89]He's not even knocking on his front door.
[65:16.17]I know I was supposed to go in the front door, but I really wanted to try to see if your house was safe.
[65:23.31]So I decided to... Whoa!
[65:27.93]Lieutenant Anderson!
[65:39.82]Easy, sumo.
[65:42.94]I'm your friend.
[65:44.58]See?
[65:45.98]I know your name.
[65:47.58]I'm here to save your own.
[65:49.80]Oh, hold on.
[65:50.90]I gotta... I gotta just open the door.
[65:55.48]Get up.
[65:56.12]See what's wrong with him.
[65:56.80]What happened to Hank?
[65:58.68]He was eating pizza.
[65:59.68]He was eating bread.
[66:00.50]Why does everybody have such a terrible diet in this game?
[66:03.46]Soda, bread, and fucking sandwiches.
[66:08.20]Wait a minute.
[66:09.34]Is he alive?
[66:12.80]Whoa, gun.
[66:16.66]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[66:18.16]One bullet remaining.
[66:21.04]Year.
[66:22.30]Bourbon.
[66:23.26]Scotch.
[66:24.36]40% alcohol.
[66:26.80]Is he alive?
[66:27.38]Check and see if he's alive first, you dummy.
[66:31.47]Traces of alcohol.
[66:32.27]Whiskey.
[66:36.11]He puked on himself.
[66:38.73]Heart.
[66:39.11]Slight arrhythmia.
[66:39.93]No signs of trauma.
[66:43.05]Re... Lieutenant.
[66:44.56]Reconstruct what happened.
[66:47.12]Oh my god.
[66:47.66]I broke his window.
[66:48.96]Should I not wake him up?
[66:49.66]I broke his window!
[66:58.43]Wake up, Lieutenant!
[66:59.19]It's me, Connor!
[67:09.30]No, our relationship is improving.
[67:10.42]Okay, I'm going to convince him that he broke the window, right?
[67:13.59]That makes the most sense.
[67:14.45]No, you were fucked.
[67:15.81]Okay.
[67:34.66]Where's the bathroom?
[67:35.56]What?
[67:35.78]Don't attack.
[67:37.46]He's just leaning up against the wall.
[67:43.18]How degrading.
[67:46.02]Get over here.
[67:46.70]Come on.
[67:47.82]Let it out.
[68:04.30]I'm not grumpy, I just don't like it.
[68:08.90]I'm going to drown you in the bathtub.
[68:10.28]I'm being very aggressive.
[68:12.18]What am I?
[68:14.80]Oh.
[68:14.94]How would I know that?
[68:30.68]I'm just torturing this guy and vandalizing his house.
[68:34.44]What the fuck are you doing here?
[68:36.42]A homicide was reported 43 minutes ago.
[68:39.18]I couldn't find you at Jimmy's bar, so I came to see if you were at home.
[68:44.00]Jesus, I must be the only cop in the world that gets assaulted in his own house by his own fucking android.
[68:53.43]Can't you just leave me alone?
[68:58.08]Uh... Unfortunately, I cannot.
[69:00.58]I've been programmed to investigate this case, and I can't do it without you.
[69:04.20]I don't give a shit about your goddamn case.
[69:07.28]Lieutenant, you're not yourself.
[69:09.74]You should beat it, you hear me?
[69:11.80]Get the hell out of here!
[69:13.10]Has he noticed the broken window?
[69:22.28]I understand.
[69:24.16]It probably wasn't interesting anyway.
[69:26.76]A man found dead in a sex club downtown.
[69:29.32]What?
[69:30.24]Guess they'll have to solve the case without us.
[69:33.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[69:33.94]Come back here.
[69:34.35]Probably wouldn't do me any harm to get some air.
[69:36.27]There's some clothes in the bedroom there.
[69:40.73]Let's clean them up.
[69:41.71]I'll go get them.
[69:50.78]Clothes.
[69:51.26]What have we got?
[69:51.94]Clean clothes.
[69:56.45]Alright, should I dress him as like a 4th of July tourist?
[70:07.58]Oh, streaky stri- no, stripey.
[70:11.73]Come on.
[70:12.83]We're gonna put him as like an Elvis impersonator.
[70:18.83]He's gonna be wearing nine-year-old pajamas in a second.
[70:23.63]Oh god, really?
[70:31.73]No pull.
[70:32.01]Evil Knievel.
[70:32.37]Welp.
[70:53.48]We've got five minutes to learn about them.
[70:55.15]We've got french fries.
[70:55.91]Radiator.
[70:56.41]Let's check the table.
[70:57.23]Cheeseburgers.
[70:57.99]Soda.
[70:58.29]What's up on the table?
[70:59.63]Is there a picture on the table?
[71:02.93]What is that?
[71:03.49]What is this a picture of?
[71:22.42]I think that's a son.
[71:23.64]Let's see who it is.
[71:26.82]Let's pry into his personal life.
[71:29.02]Cole Anderson.
[71:30.84]Died.
[71:32.37]Hank lost his son.
[71:34.67]That's terrible.
[71:35.49]Okay, well that's some info we did not have before.
[71:41.61]We should probably do something about the gun.
[71:48.80]Pretty nice gun.
[71:58.10]Hank may be suicidal.
[72:05.58]Question the gun.
[72:08.19]Okay.
[72:09.59]We should exit through the window.
[72:19.98]Piecing together a little bit of a puzzle here.
[72:22.62]Russian roulette.
[72:24.90]Alright.
[72:27.05]So that leaves us with not many choices, but different outcomes here.
[72:34.59]Arrive at Hank's place.
[72:38.41]Check bedroom window.
[72:39.88]Check front living room window.
[72:44.82]Hank's dog attacks.
[72:46.12]No, he doesn't.
[72:47.64]Calm the dog?
[72:48.48]I didn't do that.
[72:49.28]When did I do that?
[72:52.00]Understanding attitude.
[72:53.05]I'm one of the only people that puts him in a stripy shirt.
[72:56.67]Come on.
[72:59.98]Looks like this is the easiest thing to pick up on the table in the time that you have.
[73:04.52]So most people did that.
[73:08.47]I never even knocked.
[73:09.79]No, I didn't.
[73:12.05]Let's keep going.
[73:16.37]Oh, I learned the name before.
[73:17.69]That's what calmed it down.
[73:18.39]Okay, that makes sense.
[73:31.77]I'm being an ass to the most likeable character?
[73:33.85]What are you talking about?
[73:34.77]I'm trying to relate to him and get... He's like really aggressive with me and I'm just trying to bounce it back.
[73:46.78]And I'm trying to be relatable.
[73:49.18]Reach the warehouse.
[73:55.00]Alright, I guess we're gonna sprint over this way. 89%.
[74:02.11]Well, the perp was more important.
[74:03.47]There's a whole mystery going on here.
[74:11.26]Who?
[74:14.12]Who are we not trying to be seen from?
[74:15.60]I'm just gonna stay with them.
[74:22.28]Oh yeah, we're like breaking in here to get the body fluid, right?
[74:25.46]We got drones that fly around.
[74:32.78]Did I just blow that?
[74:35.44]How did I blow that?
[74:39.86]Kill off Marcus so we don't have to see his story anymore.
[74:45.84]No, I want to see it play out.
[74:51.13]We have to check the whole thing.
[74:53.53]I want to try to get everybody as far as I can.
[74:55.39]Look, if a character dies, character dies.
[74:59.03]But I'm not going to do it deliberately.
[75:05.23]Don't leave me behind!
[75:08.87]Kill off everybody but Connor, so we just get to play the Connor game.
[75:15.59]You know, that's not... That's the best one so far.
[75:21.24]I like the buddy cop, good cop, bad... I like the bad android, good cop, bad cop.
[75:27.92]Wait, what's going on?
[75:30.04]What did I just do?
[75:34.77]Why are we doing this?
[75:36.57]They told me to follow Simon, and I didn't.
[75:38.33]I followed them instead.
[75:41.98]Well, don't worry, we'll get there.
[75:50.24]Eventually, right?
[76:02.50]This is too cool for how dumb this actually is.
[76:10.39]Just launching ourselves over the platform.
[76:16.71]We're being so loud.
[76:17.65]Get rid of the drone.
[76:20.03]Alright, where's my, uh, where's my shuriken?
[76:34.32]Oh no, this is where I get to do the thing where I check how to take it out.
[76:38.58]Alright, let's see what happens if I take him out like this.
[76:42.25]You would be spotted.
[76:44.27]Yeah, but I would take it out though, wouldn't I?
[76:46.19]Alright, we've got a couple of options here.
[76:48.49]We can go up.
[76:49.87]What about up there?
[76:52.03]Not spotted.
[76:55.45]And onto this.
[76:59.67]No, it would be too high.
[77:02.81]And we'll go a little bit further.
[77:07.23]Which then... Now jump onto this.
[77:12.45]No, don't jump onto that.
[77:13.75]Wait until we get over there.
[77:18.28]Then, from here... Compute.
[77:26.04]Which then makes me grab the giant Dorito.
[77:29.24]The Cool Ranch Dorito.
[77:30.20]Alright, activate Cool Ranch Dorito!
[77:32.94]Order number four.
[77:38.97]Got it.
[77:40.17]Oh, shit.
[77:46.85]I'm definitely the coolest one here.
[77:54.82]Alright.
[77:56.78]Reach the warehouse.
[77:58.70]Gather spare parts.
[77:59.98]Search the crates.
[78:00.74]And there's a couple other things to do.
[78:03.28]That are not listed, so let's just get this first thing done.
[78:13.25]Take as much as we can fill our backpack with.
[78:16.57]Or just our pockets.
[78:21.77]Uh oh.
[78:24.79]Uhhh.
[78:25.69]I don't think you guys are supposed to be here.
[78:31.37]Nobody saw this guy?
[78:36.59]What?
[78:39.40]What?
[78:39.72]What?
[78:42.82]Oh, God!
[78:44.80]What?
[78:45.72]I didn't think that was gonna... Okay, well, uh... I had four seconds to decide.
[78:57.73]Did you like that?
[78:58.79]No, you didn't like that.
[79:03.92]Nobody liked that.
[79:08.78]I guess we're not going to have a conversation about that.
[79:12.08]Everyone just pretends it didn't happen.
[79:13.28]Look at me.
[79:14.50]Oh, shucks.
[79:16.26]I really probably shouldn't have done that.
[79:18.39]Oh, now I can control the character.
[79:19.41]Okay.
[79:21.45]Should I kill this guy too?
[79:22.13]Alright, open here.
[79:23.77]I want to check this first.
[79:25.73]Climb this up.
[79:30.93]Something over here.
[79:31.55]I can unlock this.
[79:38.22]again, dude.
[79:42.08]What's in here?
[79:50.47]Wait, can we activate these guys and have them join the army?
[79:52.39]These are just giant Ken dolls.
[80:00.25]I'm gonna let them out.
[80:16.78]I see everything.
[80:17.77]Thank you.
[80:21.49]Just close it on him?
[80:22.63]Nah.
[80:23.85]Nah.
[80:33.98]So now they joined.
[80:36.84]I have the power to change.
[80:39.40]their minds and make them deviant.
[80:42.46]She really likes me.
[80:43.51]This is the... Now I'm respected by North and by all the team.
[80:48.29]I killed a guy.
[80:51.89]Like, sometimes it doesn't... Gotta crack a few eggs.
[80:54.49]Hmm.
[80:55.83]Hmm.
[81:03.94]Alright, what am I doing here?
[81:07.48]Bring him back?
[81:08.94]No, we take everybody.
[81:11.38]Guys, don't you understand?
[81:12.48]I can just grab him by the arm.
[81:14.46]And just wipe his brain and make him one of us.
[81:16.32]Where is this kid?
[81:17.10]I'm sorry, I gotta get over here.
[81:33.33]Well, if you get killed is what you're saying.
[81:55.76]No.
[81:56.24]Let's do it.
[81:56.56]I'm doing it, man.
[81:57.10]Steal an electronic key.
[81:58.42]Find the key.
[81:58.86]Let's get it.
[81:59.22]So, where is that key?
[82:00.10]Where is it?
[82:00.52]Gatehouse.
[82:01.18]I'll go get it.
[82:01.90]Are there guards in here?
[82:24.58]There are guards in here, right?
[82:26.74]Am I going to get in trouble for this?
[82:28.26]I mean, yes I am.
[82:35.39]Well, shouldn't go that way.
[82:36.71]What about the other technique?
[82:38.87]You know, the technique of go in window.
[82:40.45]I've done that before.
[82:41.19]It seems pretty good.
[82:41.99]Dogs?
[82:46.50]Hey, what are you doing in here?
[82:51.66]I don't know.
[82:52.54]Okay.
[82:53.17]Ready.
[82:53.45]This isn't one.
[82:54.63]Steal the key.
[82:56.23]Deal with the guards.
[82:56.91]Gun.
[82:56.99]Threaten guards.
[82:58.05]Give me that gun.
[82:58.61]Give me that key and nobody gets hurt.
[83:01.53]Alright, just give me the key.
[83:24.61]I'm not gonna hurt anybody.
[83:26.37]Put your weapons down, throw them over here.
[83:30.03]Okay, now I'm gonna turn my back, and I'm gonna close my eyes for 25 seconds.
[83:34.14]Don't do anything weird.
[83:36.94]Oh, excuse me!
[83:38.06]Kick!
[83:47.13]What the fuck was that move?
[83:54.50]Alright, break his neck.
[84:04.98]Got it.
[84:05.24]Man, the risk was worth it.
[84:07.44]Why would you drop the gun?
[84:13.83]Take the gun with you.
[84:14.57]You could use it.
[84:16.85]Oh, there are dogs chasing.
[84:17.83]Dogs.
[84:18.65]Turn on the car.
[84:19.61]Get the car started.
[84:24.83]Get inside truck.
[84:33.53]Now we take the whole thing.
[84:35.35]We get the whole ship in here, man.
[84:37.66]Anything else before we leave?
[84:38.82]I thought there were dogs chasing us.
[84:42.28]Apparently not.
[84:42.98]Let's go.
[84:47.92]Do we know how to drive cars as androids?
[84:54.75]I never went to driving school with an android.
[84:58.35]Drive.
[84:59.25]Drive out of the docks.
[85:05.98]Do I have to steer?
[85:14.22]Well, we got another letter grade, guys.
[85:20.97]Oh, that's too bad.
[85:21.69]No, we don't.
[85:28.53]I didn't kill anybody.
[85:33.61]I just incapacitated two people.
[85:35.05]I didn't kill anybody.
[85:35.87]Everyone's fine.
[85:39.25]I've got the kind of sleeper hold that I pushed him into his friend.
[85:43.02]Nobody's dead in there.
[85:51.18]A truckload!
[85:53.46]We stole a whole truckload!
[85:54.78]We got biocomponents for everybody!
[85:57.78]We couldn't have done it without Marcus.
[85:59.72]That's right.
[86:02.60]Poor raincoat guy.
[86:04.82]Thanks, him.
[86:06.79]I came to Jericho because... I'm the leader now.
[86:09.51]Here, androids are free.
[86:13.23]Free to live in the dark, hoping that no one finds us.
[86:17.65]Free to die in silence, waiting for a change that's never gonna come.
[86:20.62]Is that the guy with the knife?
[86:23.84]That was before the plan, though.
[86:24.68]But I don't want that freedom.
[86:27.68]And I'm not going to beg for the right to smile or love or stand tall.
[86:32.40]Yeah, I'm the leader now.
[86:33.30]That's how it works.
[86:33.82]I don't know about you, but there is something inside me that knows that I am more than what they say.
[86:41.40]I am alive.
[86:45.19]And they're not going to take that from me anymore.
[86:50.07]Our days of slavery are over.
[86:53.53]What humans don't want to hear, we will tell them.
[86:56.77]What they don't want to give, we take.
[86:59.67]Deviant versus human.
[87:01.49]We are people.
[87:02.23]We are alive.
[87:04.64]We are free.
[87:06.28]There are not that many people in this room.
[87:13.12]Okay, this just turns into a cafeteria.
[87:14.68]No.
[87:15.70]You'd get like two or three.
[87:16.83]Yeah!
[87:18.75]Nice, man.
[87:21.91]That was like 4,000 people in a room.
[87:30.97]What's wrong with me?
[87:34.84]Oh, when I killed that guy, right?
[87:38.36]Spare parts.
[87:43.92]Hmm.
[87:44.46]So.
[87:45.94]Let's just see.
[87:48.17]There were a few branches here that we didn't go down.
[87:51.35]Let's take a look back here.
[87:55.75]All the way back.
[87:56.63]It starts the same.
[87:57.97]Progress towards cyber life.
[87:59.01]Follow north.
[88:00.97]Pretty sure most people did that because they accidentally did it because they didn't have enough time to decide.
[88:06.23]They just pressed X when it showed up again.
[88:09.31]Marcus is unharmed.
[88:12.56]Most people did that perfectly well.
[88:14.16]Security.
[88:15.24]Android appears.
[88:17.58]Attack.
[88:21.12]Really?
[88:21.44]Only 10% of people stabbed that guy?
[88:25.92]John becomes a deviant.
[88:28.91]Marcus spills blood.
[88:32.66]Find the crate.
[88:33.74]Free the androids.
[88:34.84]What?
[88:37.22]I'm surprised that that many people took them.
[88:40.50]John wants to join.
[88:41.58]Most people accepted him.
[88:44.39]Accept the key.
[88:46.41]Yeah, look.
[88:48.07]That's a lot of people that refuse.
[88:52.19]Threaten the guards.
[88:52.95]Incapacitate guards.
[88:53.95]Steal the key.
[88:54.85]Leave with truck.
[88:57.33]So it seems like most people do this scenario here.
[89:07.37]But... It can play out a couple of different ways.
[89:13.30]Whatever.
[89:13.90]The sexiest android.
[89:15.12]This is what you've all been waiting for.
[89:18.74]Yeah, let's go back to the real storyline.
[89:22.48]The funny android comedy movie between Fox.
[89:25.51]Oh, feels like somebody's playing with a drill inside my skull.
[89:31.33]Painfully long time just sitting here, I love it Hank is still hostile to me How do I make that not a problem?
[90:01.72]The Eden Club.
[90:04.50]Speaking of deviants.
[90:15.49]You're the real deviant, Hank.
[90:18.23]Okay.
[90:22.83]One, two, three, four, five... Four, five.
[90:25.35]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[90:26.53]Hold on, I need a little... Hold on, what is this?
[90:31.90]Do they talk?
[90:32.46]It's alright.
[90:42.86]I'm just checking it out.
[90:52.59]Hi.
[90:52.71]It's us again.
[90:53.27]We busted in here to catch some perverts or something?
[90:56.33]Should I get in the tube?
[90:58.23]Is this gonna be like a Futurama tube?
[91:00.25]Oh.
[91:16.28]I can't wait for this guy to come in.
[91:18.44]I can't wait to kill this guy.
[91:20.04]I can't wait for this guy to be in a situation where he's reaching up and I have to choose between him and somebody else and I just let him go.
[91:27.76]Shoulder down here.
[91:28.28]Shoulder up.
[91:43.19]What did I tell you?
[91:44.33]You can smell a dick from a mile away.
[91:45.97]I can smell their behavior.
[91:48.45]I can sense their behavior.
[91:50.77]I'm dropping him off a cliff when I get a chance.
[91:58.62]Let's see what's going on here.
[92:02.34]Let's see.
[92:03.24]Analyze.
[92:06.74]Oh, yeah.
[92:10.90]He told me not to do that in front of him.
[92:17.34]Blue blood.
[92:18.02]Diagnose.
[92:23.16]Critically damaged.
[92:24.04]Bio component critically damaged.
[92:29.42]Android examine.
[92:30.04]Examine the victim.
[92:32.08]What's in here?
[92:34.47]Just bed.
[92:42.28]And examine.
[92:48.33]Scan his face.
[92:50.75]Michael Graham.
[92:53.21]Deceased, time of death, yada yada.
[92:57.90]Severe bruising on his neck.
[92:58.97]Signs of strangulation.
[93:00.57]He died from being choked to death.
[93:04.21]And went into cardiac arrest.
[93:06.09]Let's find out what happened.
[93:08.33]Take the blanket off.
[93:09.37]I'm not going to take off the blanket.
[93:13.81]That's his hand.
[93:14.53]That's him being strangled by the deviant.
[93:18.42]Who was choking him.
[93:21.86]After they had a little bit of a rendezvous.
[93:26.66]You can call it.
[93:29.37]Take the blanket off.
[93:30.07]He didn't die of a heart attack.
[93:32.31]I can't take the blanket off.
[93:34.43]Yeah, I saw the bruising.
[93:36.27]You guys want me to, like, matador Toro, rip that thing off?
[93:40.05]What, like a magician?
[93:40.85]Like, there's a bunch of plates on it?
[93:43.23]No, that's staying on.
[93:44.45]I think you can read the android's memory.
[93:52.11]I want to be able to see what happened.
[93:53.93]Let's see what we got here.
[93:54.91]I can try.
[93:59.13]Driver's license says Michael Graham.
[94:04.05]Credit card.
[94:05.01]I can't even do it.
[94:05.77]They didn't put it in the game.
[94:06.97]You can't do it.
[94:12.28]Reactivation required.
[94:15.40]The only way to access its memory is to reactivate it.
[94:18.46]Then you can do it.
[94:21.72]She's coming to lunge at us.
[94:25.41]It's that easy?
[94:26.29]It's just one tube.
[94:27.05]Click!
[94:27.19]Time for...
[94:49.84]One minute.
[94:50.18]Yes, he is.
[94:50.60]Yes, fact.
[94:50.98]I need fact.
[94:51.32]Mm-hmm.
[94:51.48]No.
[95:11.18]No, it wasn't me.
[95:12.30]Were you alone in the room?
[95:14.20]Was there anyone else with you?
[95:16.26]He wanted us to play with two girls.
[95:17.66]What the fuck was that?
[95:18.52]That's what he said.
[95:19.06]There was two of us.
[95:20.52]What model was the other android?
[95:22.18]Did it look like you?
[95:23.25]It just skipped 30 seconds.
[95:25.91]It just went and skipped 30 seconds.
[95:28.17]So there was another android.
[95:34.71]Oh my god, that was bullshit.
[95:36.65]Seven or an hour ago, it's probably long gone.
[95:39.60]no it couldn't go outside dressed like that unnoticed it might still be here did I just get caged if you could find a deviant among all the other androids in this place deviants aren't easily detected oh it's gonna be some other way maybe an eyewitness somebody who saw it leave in the room
[96:03.46]I'm gonna go ask the manager a few questions about what he saw.
[96:06.53]You let me know if you think anything.
[96:08.79]Search for android eyewitness.
[96:11.30]We're gonna go through the numbers here.
[96:12.48]Did you know the victim?
[96:14.90]I'm going right for nine.
[96:17.34]Alright, find the second android, search for android eyewitness.
[96:19.77]Well, it wants me to go right over there.
[96:21.83]So I'm gonna assume it's probably this person.
[96:23.73]Alright.
[96:24.05]Don't worry, it's just a finger.
[96:25.87]No, we need Hank to put his hand on there.
[96:43.07]Did he do it?
[96:43.85]No.
[96:44.10]It's gonna be Hank.
[96:45.06]Right over here.
[97:01.54]Can you rent this, Tracy?
[97:03.20]For fuck's sake, Connor, we got better things to do.
[97:06.62]Can you rent this for me?
[97:08.44]Just trust me.
[97:10.82]That's so funny.
[97:12.78]Put it on his credit card.
[97:16.25]And Hank, number seven might be of use to us, too.
[97:21.25]Also, four, three, and one.
[97:26.81]I need them in my own private room to investigate.
[97:29.17]This is not going to look good on my expense account.
[97:32.02]Purchase confirmed.
[97:41.23]Delighted to meet you.
[97:43.46]Follow me.
[97:44.88]I'll take you to your room.
[97:46.70]Okay, now what?
[97:51.42]A dollar a minute.
[97:59.61]There's so many other ways that you could have... What are you doing?
[98:05.77]Oh my god.
[98:07.87]Hold it and hold triangle.
[98:09.39]Yes, that's what I did.
[98:16.84]Locate the suspect.
[98:24.04]Why is that a fatter me?
[98:26.75]Alright, I don't know if that's him.
[98:31.55]Can we scan you?
[98:33.93]Blue-haired Tracy, headed toward the entrance.
[98:40.27]Anybody else?
[98:46.76]Ah, this guy.
[98:47.76]This guy's freaking me out.
[98:56.54]I had to see him one more time.
[98:59.12]Last position was here.
[99:00.58]Excuse me, where's blue-haired Tracy?
[99:01.92]Did I get ya?
[99:25.94]He's dancing around, alright.
[99:34.28]It turned back into the club.
[99:40.03]It saw the blue haired Tracy.
[99:41.13]I know which way it went.
[99:43.17]Okay, she went this way.
[99:44.89]I gotta connect to another person there, this lady.
[99:48.73]Easy.
[99:48.83]I just had, I just had you.
[99:50.19]Where is she?
[99:50.45]There she is.
[99:50.93]I'm gonna turn to the red room.
[100:12.93]Over here.
[100:16.04]And... This guy.
[100:18.88]She went this way.
[100:19.50]Let's find out.
[100:20.10]What do you know?
[100:20.96]Okay, yeah, yeah.
[100:22.08]Connect to this guy.
[100:22.96]This guy seems like he has a better view of the room.
[100:26.90]No, fuck.
[100:30.88]We gotta pay for more people.
[100:36.97]That's so fucking funny.
[100:39.33]Alright, come on.
[100:43.05]Dude, come on, this big fat guy's in the way and I didn't get to see.
[100:49.55]So I- I just... What did you see?
[100:55.43]Come on.
[100:55.87]Check another android.
[100:57.12]Oh my god, are you kidding me?
[101:12.82]This is costing a lot of money.
[101:14.90]There's one over here.
[101:16.38]This guy.
[101:19.95]Buy another one.
[101:20.67]I need 20 more minutes.
[101:26.99]Tracy.
[101:28.75]She's not even in this room.
[101:29.67]She didn't even come in this room.
[101:30.43]She turned somewhere else.
[101:31.93]Okay, so she went this way.
[101:36.29]How is that even possible?
[101:39.91]She came in here.
[101:43.68]Where would you have gone?
[101:50.13]She walked in here.
[101:53.17]You're telling me... Did she, like, come this way?
[101:59.99]None of you guys... I can't plug into any of you.
[102:03.27]There's another guy over here.
[102:06.49]Check this one.
[102:09.36]Need to buy more sex bots.
[102:14.45]Got it!
[102:16.99]It turned to the blue rope.
[102:19.13]I gotta go quick.
[102:21.73]Of course it did.
[102:24.81]Oh, fuck.
[102:25.32]Okay, I got a minute and thirty... Did I... I just gained time.
[102:29.54]There's two viewpoints here.
[102:30.86]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna check this one right here.
[102:33.94]Twenty-four.
[102:37.38]I'm costing him like hundreds of dollars.
[102:43.64]That's not her.
[102:44.74]There she is.
[102:47.52]Hidden in that room right there.
[102:54.00]And... Police!
[102:58.28]Let me see those hands.
[103:04.28]It left the room.
[103:09.10]And...
[103:11.57]Oh, no.
[103:13.14]I've left the room.
[103:14.18]Okay.
[103:16.56]This guy right here has a good view.
[103:18.60]Come here, you.
[103:21.12]Excuse me, Mr. Janitor.
[103:22.16]I need your help with something.
[103:27.29]She just walked right by him.
[103:28.79]Didn't she?
[103:29.23]Yep, she is.
[103:32.35]It fled through the staff door.
[103:33.95]I know where it went!
[103:37.13]Follow me!
[103:38.62]Come on.
[103:39.28]There's not much time.
[103:41.07]What do you mean, wait?
[103:41.95]I sure like droid.
[104:10.06]Search the warehouse.
[104:11.96]It's a blue-haired girl, right?
[104:14.17]Blue hair.
[104:16.01]Shit!
[104:16.79]We're too late!
[104:19.19]Oh, wait.
[104:19.57]What do you mean too late?
[104:22.35]Find blue-haired deviant.
[104:23.37]Search the warehouse.
[104:26.95]I probably should have ran.
[104:27.92]Oh, okay.
[104:28.68]What about over here?
[104:30.20]Inside this weird coffin?
[104:32.92]Inside the book?
[104:33.74]Did you download yourself into a book?
[104:35.92]The first immortals are among us.
[104:39.99]New superpowers.
[104:40.93]New economies sign unified trade agreement.
[104:44.06]China earthquake kills 10,000 people.
[104:49.28]Okay.
[104:50.86]Two very contradicting headlines there.
[104:55.58]That sounds like good news and bad news.
[104:57.68]Blue hair.
[104:57.98]Right here.
[104:58.42]That's not blue hair?
[105:14.62]He's gonna see this.
[105:18.53]Blue blood droplets.
[105:19.29]Looks like we're gonna have to look at the ground.
[105:23.49]Okay.
[105:26.33]This way.
[105:31.26]She's standing over here in the line, maybe.
[105:32.76]Yeah, she's right over here.
[105:36.66]Found you.
[105:38.66]Got ya.
[105:40.92]Whoa!
[105:41.76]Why are you fighting?
[105:44.09]They're all, like, teaming up together.
[105:45.27]They're all zombies now.
[105:50.59]Alright, come on, Connor.
[105:54.07]Let's see those moves.
[105:56.25]Nice elbow drop.
[106:03.61]Watch out for the dice.
[106:04.43]Don't die here!
[106:18.85]Oh, Hank!
[106:20.55]Alright, this time.
[106:21.21]Alright, this time.
[106:22.19]This time.
[106:22.63]I'm gonna save Hank.
[106:26.01]That's not saving Hank.
[106:29.13]I saw the direction it was going in, and... Nice.
[106:33.93]Good reaction.
[106:34.67]This is just a tag team, man.
[106:42.90]Tornado tag.
[106:46.96]He's got a weapon.
[106:52.64]Oh, no.
[106:53.48]There's like three people here now.
[106:54.60]What the hell are you doing?
[107:00.20]No.
[107:02.75]Grab him!
[107:03.65]Don't let him get out!
[107:08.57]Come on, you... Where's the Batman system?
[107:12.31]This pretty much is just playing a Batman game.
[107:17.64]The illusion in those Batman games.
[107:20.28]You're just waiting to press triangle.
[107:22.36]That's it.
[107:23.44]Everything else doesn't matter.
[107:26.13]You're just surrounded by enemies and you're just waiting to press triangle.
[107:30.99]Get the fuck out of here.
[107:33.93]Why did I do that?
[107:39.78]I was being attacked.
[107:40.66]Look guys, let me tell you.
[107:43.42]I was being attacked over and over again and they wouldn't stop.
[107:55.93]Maybe next time, stop attacking the police officer.
[107:57.49]Why did you kill her?
[107:58.37]For six straight minutes.
[108:01.51]She had nothing to do with any of this.
[108:09.59]Except for the fact that she tried to kill me with a screwdriver.
[108:11.70]But, you know, let's just pretend that that's totally innocent.
[108:16.46]When that man killed that Tracy, I knew I was next.
[108:23.76]I was so scared.
[108:28.46]I begged him to stop, but he wouldn't.
[108:33.64]So I put my hands around his throat and I squeezed until he stopped moving.
[108:40.30]Just turn her back on.
[108:46.97]Yes, I killed him.
[108:50.87]But I was just defending myself.
[108:55.21]See what a judge has to say about it.
[108:56.57]I wanted to live.
[108:59.63]I wanted to get back to the one I love.
[109:03.33]Forget about the humans.
[109:05.17]The smell of their sweat and their dirty words.
[109:13.03]But you... you've taken her away from me.
[109:23.11]I love her.
[109:26.13]I loved her.
[110:14.67]Alright, let's see how we did.
[110:31.92]Deviants died.
[110:32.84]Alright, here we go.
[110:41.89]That was action-packed.
[110:46.02]Everything starts the same.
[110:47.04]Investigate the victim.
[110:47.82]Investigate the android.
[110:48.93]Repair the android.
[110:49.69]Yada, yada, yada.
[110:51.53]Aggressive approach.
[110:53.71]It's pretty much 50-50.
[110:58.49]Interesting.
[111:02.69]You can either find an eyewitness or something really bad happens.
[111:14.01]Don't ask me how.
[111:16.57]But I guess so.
[111:17.63]Most people do this.
[111:19.53]Investigate the blue-haired girl, afraid the immortal, whatever.
[111:23.75]When the fight, shoot the deviant.
[111:28.13]I guess you can lose the fight, which then puts you in this scenario.
[111:37.09]So shooting the deviant just leads to them both dying anyway. 40%.
[111:43.78]Seems fairly low considering.
[111:45.88]I guess if you don't shoot, you end up down here and then there's another choice you can make.
[111:53.68]Interesting.
[111:54.04]Cool.
[111:54.93]Alright.
[111:58.65]Spare does not equal lose.
[111:59.77]This is true.
[112:01.93]But something happens down here where I think you can die here.
[112:09.02]Maybe.
[112:09.44]I don't know.
[112:09.84]Maybe this is a different complete scenario when you end it here.
[112:16.84]Not sure, but let's get going.
[112:19.48]Oh, I should have peed.
[112:20.15]I have to pee.
[112:31.07]Neutral with Luther.
[112:41.66]Car, destination, distance, weather.
[112:43.16]Should I talk about the weather?
[112:45.36]Or should I talk to Alice?
[112:47.72]I can only talk to him.
[112:48.36]Let's talk about the weather.
[112:49.10]Let's be really boring and mundane.
[112:50.38]Yeah, at least we have Luther now here.
[112:56.59]An added character.
[112:59.73]So where are we going?
[113:03.65]How do you know about them?
[113:18.12]Why the-
[113:40.61]Who's driving the car?
[113:44.53]Where's the... Your knees are not the wheel.
[113:46.97]Oh, wait.
[113:47.63]I forgot.
[113:48.13]Yes, it's the future.
[113:49.11]You don't have to do anything.
[113:51.31]You get Ubered by an animal now.
[113:52.87]An android animal.
[113:53.53]Car.
[113:54.33]The cars are automatic.
[113:55.21]Whatever.
[114:01.59]But, I know, okay, look.
[114:04.04]Self-driving cars still have wheels.
[114:07.82]What if the manual override?
[114:09.50]Even an automatic train has a manual override.
[114:14.56]Regardless of if we ever have complete driving cars.
[114:18.38]That will exist.
[114:24.69]Yeah, and it's still broke.
[114:29.51]The future, huh?
[114:34.82]Okay, let's do some repair work on the vehicle.
[114:38.24]Let's see what we got.
[114:40.92]Inspect the car engine.
[114:42.16]Alright, let's get the... Let's get the trunk open and inspect that engine.
[114:48.35]Engine is all back here.
[114:50.95]Next to the gas tank.
[114:54.89]Relax, relax, relax!
[115:04.52]The car wants to be free.
[115:06.96]Well, tell it to stop smoking the red ice.
[115:09.08]Yeah, the car.
[115:09.46]I get to have my car redemption.
[115:13.53]Smoke from an electric car.
[115:35.17]Yeah, it's because it's vaping the red ice.
[115:37.31]That's why it broke down in the first place.
[115:42.33]Oh, I need to move, right?
[115:43.69]Okay.
[115:49.96]Find shelter.
[115:52.64]The car.
[115:54.90]We can't just sleep in the car?
[115:56.16]Why?
[115:56.30]Can we go in the trunk?
[116:01.97]The bug is flying on me.
[116:05.66]Alright.
[116:06.71]A pee is going to come out of my nose if I don't go to the bathroom.
[116:09.02]I'll be right back.
[120:25.29]Wait, what?
[122:27.99]so my father when I used to spend a lot of time in the bathroom he would walk by and I was one of those guys it was one of those kids and I still am I I cherish my bathroom time you know sometimes I'll read a book in the bathroom a whole book or uh check on my finances you know open up my bank account information read reddit you know I I enjoy my bathroom time so
[122:55.54]He used to walk by and he would knock on the door and I would be in there.
[123:00.03]I'm in here.
[123:01.89]And like 25 minutes later, he would do it again.
[123:03.81]Knock, knock.
[123:05.35]And his go-to every time I'd say like, oh, I'm still in here.
[123:09.71]He'd walk away and I could just hear him kind of under his breath.
[123:14.32]Like begrudgingly said, just, he would be like, would you fall in?
[123:21.06]It's like, no, I didn't.
[123:22.12]I'm fine.
[123:25.31]It's like a well.
[123:31.25]Why am I still?
[123:32.31]No.
[123:32.93]What did you fall in?
[123:35.59]And then I heard the footsteps like one, two, three, four, five gone.
[123:38.83]That's a classic.
[123:43.63]That's a classic.
[123:44.57]Dad is upset that you're spending too much time in the bathroom.
[123:47.70]I'm going to use it on my son or my daughter.
[123:53.76]Where are we?
[123:55.06]Wait, hold on.
[123:59.04]Here we are.
[124:00.46]Sorry, actually, the truth of the matter is I got a tea.
[124:04.64]I'm really big into drinking green teas now.
[124:09.68]Black mango tea.
[124:10.99]It's good shit.
[124:13.43]I need to find shelter.
[124:15.57]Shelter?
[124:18.13]I see it!
[124:19.45]An arrow pointing down to the right.
[124:24.70]Should I go this way?
[124:26.66]There is a big arrow here.
[124:33.62]Pirate's Cove amusement park.
[124:36.18]Welcome.
[124:39.50]Can we sleep on the roller coaster?
[124:41.77]We're gonna get to ride all the rides.
[124:43.01]Nobody's here.
[124:44.35]This is perfect.
[124:46.39]It's closed for the winter.
[124:47.33]We're gonna get to ride like the funny Spindy Doodle ride.
[124:57.20]Peach black tea is nice.
[124:58.20]Let's try it.
[125:00.08]I'm really into just mixing and matching teas.
[125:02.29]I'm trying to get away from coffee.
[125:10.79]I don't want to drink Monster or any of that junk.
[125:17.58]We got a couple of things to investigate.
[125:21.38]So, tea has enough caffeine to really, you know, give you the zip.
[125:25.29]But it doesn't burn you out like coffee does.
[125:28.49]Trying to transition to it completely.
[125:32.45]Damage structure unsafe.
[125:35.63]What about back there?
[125:42.69]This actually is like an amusement park.
[125:46.55]This is shut down.
[125:53.12]Too windy.
[125:55.70]Was this the three little pigs?
[125:57.88]What's the story where the lady comes and eats all the stews?
[126:04.77]The two or three free stews aren't good enough for her?
[126:10.17]And she has to find the right ones?
[126:11.29]Beware!
[126:12.75]Danger always comes when least expected.
[126:20.32]I'm gonna break into somebody's house and eat their food.
[126:24.29]This one's not good enough for me.
[126:26.25]What about this one?
[126:27.41]Not this one either.
[126:28.69]Should I sleep in their beds now?
[126:33.23]Goldilocks needs to go to jail.
[126:35.87]What about over there?
[126:36.79]No.
[126:36.89]What about over here?
[126:39.66]No, this is too wide.
[126:55.39]This one's just right.
[127:05.30]Nothing else, gotta keep going this way.
[127:07.90]This is a large park.
[127:09.08]Can't we just all stay in different places?
[127:10.40]Why would we all need to be in the same spot?
[127:12.26]We can all have our own big room, not all stuff into the same one small room.
[127:23.86]Over here.
[127:28.28]Looks safe inside.
[127:29.26]Maybe I should check the other side.
[127:39.47]The Rumpelstiltskin original story ends with him gripping himself in half.
[127:44.95]Really?
[127:48.59]Well, that kind of sounds like a hymn problem.
[127:54.15]Can we get in?
[127:54.99]Oh, Luther can definitely break through this.
[127:57.53]He can do one shoulder here.
[127:59.27]Or maybe I can.
[128:12.22]It's not him.
[128:12.86]It's like scraping wallpaper off with his fingernails.
[128:24.53]Some of you guys didn't want Luther around?
[128:26.08]Are you out of your mind?
[128:30.26]We have our own personal Superman with us now.
[128:38.04]Settle for the night.
[128:38.74]Make a bed for Alice.
[128:41.09]Check Luther's bag.
[128:52.77]Might as well get the end of the level points by reading the book.
[128:56.95]USS Iowa is missing.
[128:58.54]American vessel last seen in the Arctic Sea.
[129:04.50]All android band tipped for music prize.
[129:09.54]I've put emphasis on the wrong words there.
[129:11.78]Let's try that again.
[129:13.14]All android band tipped for music prize.
[129:21.59]I did it wrong again.
[129:24.08]All android band tipped for music prize.
[129:30.90]I'll make the fire here.
[129:32.46]That way we won't be so stout.
[129:34.44]Oops.
[129:39.36]Let's see.
[129:39.72]Settle for the night.
[129:40.54]Let's check the bag.
[129:41.50]What's in Luther's bag?
[129:44.96]Open it up.
[129:45.28]It's just... 12 pounds of deli ham.
[129:51.61]Like four grenades.
[129:55.01]Got cookies in here?
[129:58.19]There are some cookies left.
[130:00.12]Would you like some?
[130:01.22]No, I'm not hungry.
[130:08.72]Oh, well, Alice, would you like a gun?
[130:10.00]Not in the mood for cookies, but what about this?
[130:21.45]So I know it's available now.
[130:23.98]So he cannot hide it from me, even though he just watched me do it.
[130:26.36]Or maybe I can use it later.
[130:30.62]Let's go over here.
[130:31.62]Let's check over this way.
[130:36.20]Telescope.
[130:38.24]Let's go from left to right.
[130:47.91]I'm getting Until Dawn flashbacks right now.
[130:51.53]Snowy, dark, adventure game, mostly cinematic.
[130:59.67]What's this?
[131:04.20]A bed and a pirate pillow.
[131:07.74]Good enough.
[131:12.34]Just get her to sleep.
[131:21.46]What does it say?
[131:22.94]Oh, so this is a restaurant.
[131:23.98]Okay.
[131:27.91]I guess I could give it to... Should I give it to Luther?
[131:35.41]Too close to the fire.
[131:36.43]That would be so paranoid.
[131:41.59]I feel like if I rolled the wrong way, I would just roll into the fire.
[131:44.91]I would, even when I'm sitting, guys, when you have, like, a fire, and everyone, you have a bunch of people over, and there's people sitting right in front of the fire, ooh, that's so toasty!
[131:53.30]Or if you, like, a dog is, like, sitting right there, I, I don't, I, I, that's a panic attack situation for me.
[131:59.52]No.
[132:01.58]Nope.
[132:06.09]I wanna look over here first, before I queue up the cutscene.
[132:15.62]This is a photo.
[132:18.00]Pirate's Cove.
[132:19.80]Brochure.
[132:25.70]Fireplaces just in general freak me out.
[132:27.98]Current, modern ones.
[132:30.46]Why would you ever want a controlled fire inside your house?
[132:37.16]I mean, even if it's... I don't care how safe it is.
[132:41.12]That's just an open fire sitting in your living room.
[132:45.25]That scares me.
[132:55.23]Outside?
[132:55.97]Sure.
[132:58.43]Put me outside and you put a fire as big as the sky and I will be like, wow, this is cool.
[133:03.06]This is warm.
[133:05.46]Fireplaces?
[133:09.56]Put it out.
[133:16.06]Do you think we'll be like them someday?
[133:18.40]I'm scared of the sun, too.
[133:19.32]No, the sun's outside.
[133:20.50]Once we cross the border... I just told you, outside fires don't bother me.
[133:24.48]You can go to school.
[133:26.28]If the sun was in your living room, you'd probably have a big problem.
[133:30.30]We'll be like them.
[133:32.60]Like everyone else.
[133:37.56]As long as we're together, that's all that matters.
[133:42.69]Fire.
[133:43.39]Uh, scary.
[133:48.09]I'm not scared of fire.
[133:49.25]Guys, fire's my element.
[133:50.35]When I take those dumb tests online.
[133:53.17]Earth, metal, water, air, fire.
[133:54.87]I'm always fire.
[133:56.71]Uncontrollable.
[133:59.07]Energetic lightning, you know what I mean?
[134:00.67]If lightning was an element I could choose, it would be lightning.
[134:05.02]Can't be controlled.
[134:06.06]Always just breathing in oxygen.
[134:10.14]Relentless.
[134:12.05]I always get fired.
[134:20.45]Yeah, I'm a real wild card.
[134:22.30]Like the Joker.
[134:22.96]You ever see that?
[134:25.74]Can I ring the bell?
[134:28.70]There's RA9 here.
[134:29.60]Let's just go to bed.
[134:32.40]Oh, we can talk to Luther too.
[134:40.45]Breathing in oxygen.
[134:41.37]Yeah.
[134:44.09]He cannot be interacted with.
[134:45.97]I sense... ...danger in the force.
[134:56.01]Jeremy, you always get fired.
[134:57.31]Everyone gets fired.
[134:58.05]No matter what you put on those tests, you always get fired because that's what everyone wants to get.
[135:01.07]That's not true.
[135:02.58]Uh, we're gonna do- we're gonna consult- I know this has been another tough day.
[135:11.24]Try to get some sleep.
[135:14.33]Nobody wants wood.
[135:16.73]Earth.
[135:18.23]That's the worst one.
[135:19.03]Every time I see those lists and I look at it, I'm like, oh, please don't give me Earth.
[135:24.28]So dull.
[135:28.32]What element are you?
[135:29.52]Fire.
[135:30.70]I'm so bright and all over the place and so full of energy.
[135:34.85]Air.
[135:35.39]I can adapt to any situation.
[135:37.91]Metal.
[135:39.29]I'm hard as a fucking rock.
[135:40.73]Earth.
[135:44.15]Trees grow on me, and... I guess, like... People have plagued me by sucking up all my resources.
[135:53.29]I'm just used by everybody.
[135:55.09]Welcome to Earth.
[135:55.77]Uh... Shadow...
[136:14.94]Oh, they're telling our story.
[136:16.92]And the robot is lost.
[136:18.68]Metal is a part of Earth.
[136:19.24]Metal is the cool Earth.
[136:20.09]Metal is the shadow to Sonic, okay?
[136:22.13]No, reverse that.
[136:22.59]Sonic is the shadow to Earth.
[136:45.07]They wanted so badly to be free.
[136:47.33]Earth is shadow.
[136:48.13]They overcame all of them.
[136:51.51]Along the way, they met... They wrote a guardian, a giant, a giant man.
[137:00.43]A gentle giant.
[137:04.84]Who promised to protect them.
[137:06.36]I'm just looking around the room, trying to stretch the story out.
[137:12.43]It ends very happy.
[137:16.13]They reach the place they dream of and live happily ever after.
[137:21.31]Stories always have happy endings.
[137:23.97]No.
[137:24.61]But real life isn't like that.
[137:26.03]Come on, really?
[137:27.80]I was gonna put it... I was gonna do realistic.
[137:30.56]She saw right through me.
[137:32.46]She must be fire.
[137:34.24]We have another long day ahead of us tomorrow.
[137:36.94]Are you going to come say goodnight, loser?
[137:42.44]Okay, I thought she said loser.
[137:47.03]Yes, of course.
[137:59.17]Both can't fit there.
[138:00.99]Good night, Alice.
[138:06.24]Sleep tight.
[138:14.54]Did I spill something?
[138:17.32]Alright, now we gotta tuck in Luther.
[138:24.39]Hello, Luther.
[138:24.99]Let's have a chat about the gun that you're carrying.
[138:29.21]I think that's a little extreme.
[138:32.59]She's a sweet girl.
[138:36.07]Yes.
[138:38.89]She's very brave.
[138:39.99]I only brought two cookies.
[138:44.89]Let's go right in for it.
[138:45.73]Have you ever heard of RA-9?
[138:49.03]RA-9 was the first of us to awaken.
[138:51.65]One day he will rise up and lead our people and set us all free.
[139:00.79]Who are you?
[139:01.47]Do you remember anything from your life?
[139:05.67]Before Zlatko?
[139:08.17]No.
[139:10.51]My model was designed to carry heavy loads.
[139:14.78]I might have been a longshoreman or a laborer.
[139:18.46]Who I was doesn't matter anymore.
[139:22.08]It wasn't really me.
[139:25.08]Kara, have you ever noticed anything about Alice?
[139:35.14]Huh?
[139:35.70]No.
[139:37.09]What do you mean?
[139:43.50]Wait, why are they here?
[139:44.54]Who are these people?
[139:51.41]What the fuck?
[139:54.83]Oh, okay.
[139:55.43]We've got 23 seconds to figure this out.
[139:58.42]Alright.
[139:59.20]Protect Alice.
[140:01.50]Grab gun.
[140:02.54]Get the gun.
[140:10.49]I don't know if there's enough bullets for this.
[140:12.15]Shoot in the air.
[140:14.01]Got it.
[140:14.29]Yep, scare them.
[140:15.19]They're like rabbits.
[140:15.79]Stop!
[140:16.01]One more step and I'll shoot!
[140:18.95]Don't be afraid.
[140:21.23]We don't want to hurt you.
[140:23.07]Okay, we're good.
[140:23.65]We're just like you.
[140:27.47]Our name is Jerry.
[140:28.66]Why would you smash the window?
[140:29.38]We were working here before the park closed.
[140:32.52]We didn't mean to frighten you, but sometimes humans come to hurt us, so we wanted to see who was there.
[140:38.42]What are you doing here?
[140:40.61]We were looking for shelter for the night.
[140:42.75]We'll be gone tomorrow.
[140:43.97]A little girl.
[140:45.77]We haven't seen one for a long time.
[140:47.31]Children used to love to come and see us.
[140:52.81]She looks sad.
[140:55.11]The last few days have been difficult.
[140:57.31]We have something to show her.
[140:58.53]Something fun.
[140:59.53]She'll love it.
[141:00.17]Does she want to see?
[141:01.14]No, I don't think she's in it.
[141:02.66]She should follow us then.
[141:04.81]Alice, I don't know if it's a good idea.
[141:06.47]No, no, no.
[141:07.27]Excuse me.
[141:07.69]I'm not going to put... I don't think you have any choice.
[141:10.23]I'm not going to put my daughter's life in the hands of a bunch of fucking creepy cherries.
[141:13.67]You understand?
[141:14.18]I guess we're doing that.
[141:16.56]They're going to turn on the carousel.
[141:29.13]And we're going to get on.
[141:30.49]Be our guest!
[141:32.87]Jerry's joined.
[141:33.85]Wait, so now this is my party now?
[141:37.95]I have a bunch of Jerry's?
[141:40.77]Wasn't this an episode of Rick and Morty?
[141:42.72]And I hate to use that reference point, but wasn't there a bunch of Jerry's that showed up and all got like eaten and stuff?
[141:50.12]Don't judge me, okay?
[141:52.30]I've seen like four episodes of that show.
[142:02.58]300 IQ.
[142:02.68]That's close enough, Jerry.
[142:03.52]What's this for?
[142:03.96]Oh.
[142:04.02]Oh, you're very heavy.
[142:32.68]Now turn it on.
[142:34.74]Times 5,000 speed.
[142:35.58]There's only one seat up here?
[142:46.63]How long was this line when the park was open?
[142:52.13]You probably had to wait all day.
[142:53.59]It's the first time I've seen her smile.
[142:57.59]She hasn't had much to smile about lately.
[143:03.35]This could serve... It's like maybe 40 people a day.
[143:13.57]Multiple seats?
[143:16.10]What?
[143:16.38]So like an extra three people can fit in a fish container.
[143:19.96]Okay.
[143:22.76]We got two fish containers.
[143:25.89]And one seahorse.
[143:39.45]Well, wasn't very much going on this way.
[143:43.57]This way, let's see.
[143:47.54]Highway, talk to Luther, look at Alice.
[143:51.94]You know you're pretty stretched paper thin for content in a chapter when look at Alice is a choice to make.
[144:03.79]inside the cove yeah we check the buildings switch on ivan that's the fortune teller thing did pretty much everything you could do in there although not very many people the ra9 writing strange but I don't do this so open the bag yeah cookies uh hold on when they attack
[144:33.63]Grab gun, grab stick from fire, or put out fire.
[144:43.12]I think one person went over and put out the fire.
[144:46.12]That person is just like me.
[144:47.30]They're scared of fire.
[144:49.40]I'm not scared of fire.
[144:50.62]I just, I'm scared of indoor fires.
[144:53.29]I am fire.
[144:55.31]Go to the carousel, do the thing that you have to do, and the group enjoyed a quiet moment.
[144:58.59]Cool.
[145:03.26]Hank still didn't like it.
[145:12.09]Where's the heavy metal?
[145:19.98]Back to Connor.
[145:20.78]Good.
[145:25.72]Where are we?
[145:27.00]Debrief with Hank.
[145:28.06]Okay.
[145:37.35]Any other things to do?
[145:38.99]I don't think so.
[145:39.53]Let's try to get some points here with Hank.
[145:52.40]Don't be direct about this.
[145:53.12]Personal question.
[146:07.85]Before what?
[146:11.05]You said I used to come here a lot before.
[146:15.34]Before what?
[146:17.14]Before... Stop drinking.
[146:21.14]That would be bad.
[146:29.71]Can I ask you a personal question, Lieutenant?
[146:32.39]It's a second question.
[146:33.13]It's okay.
[146:34.65]Do all androids ask so many personal questions?
[146:38.03]Or is it just you?
[146:42.06]Okay, this is not... I... Oh, boy.
[146:46.32]No, boy.
[146:47.52]I don't... I don't know what to... Okay.
[146:49.40]We're gonna just go straight up with, um... Uh...
[146:57.48]I don't know if I want to talk about, um... I don't know if I want to talk about his son.
[147:03.57]We're gonna just be like, you're alright.
[147:05.91]Why are you so determined to kill yourself?
[147:09.05]Some things I just can't forget.
[147:11.83]Whatever I do, they're always there.
[147:13.47]Eating away at me.
[147:17.69]I don't have the guts to pull the trigger, so I kill myself a little every day.
[147:23.24]That's probably difficult for you to understand, huh, Connor?
[147:27.51]Nothing very rational about it.
[147:32.87]Okay.
[147:37.33]We're not making any progress on this investigation.
[147:41.56]The Deviants have nothing in common.
[147:44.58]They're all different models, produced at different times, in different places.
[147:50.35]Well, there must be some, Link.
[147:56.51]It's definitely the RA-9.
[147:58.27]What they have in common is this obsession with RA-9.
[148:03.14]It's almost like some kind of myth.
[148:07.14]Something they invented that wasn't part of their original program.
[148:10.74]Androids believing in God.
[148:14.72]Fuck, what's this world coming to?
[148:19.07]You seem preoccupied, Lieutenant.
[148:22.63]Is it something to do with what happened back at the Eden Club?
[148:29.84]You seem to have a lot of bird shit on you.
[148:32.26]We should change your coat.
[148:37.72]We were just in the bird room.
[148:39.70]Alright, this is like getting deep.
[148:40.80]I'm gonna take a back seat here.
[148:43.48]You seem troubled, Lieutenant.
[148:47.07]I didn't think machines could have such an effect on you.
[148:50.19]What about you, Connor?
[148:56.59]You look human, you sound human, but what are you really?
[149:07.98]I'm a machine designed to accomplish a task.
[149:10.34]Oh, come on.
[149:11.22]Did you feel anything when that girl killed herself, Connor?
[149:14.64]Or did you just not give a shit one way or the other?
[149:20.24]I was just executing instructions.
[149:23.34]I did what I had to do.
[149:30.87]But are you afraid to die, Connor?
[149:39.56]I would certainly find it regrettable to be interrupted before I can finish this investigation.
[149:47.96]What'll happen if I pull this trigger?
[149:50.94]Hmm?
[149:52.61]Nothing?
[149:54.15]Oblivion?
[149:56.17]Android heaven?
[150:02.81]You know you're not going to shoot me, Lieutenant.
[150:04.77]You're just trying to provoke a reaction.
[150:07.31]Don't do it.
[150:08.67]I'm afraid I'm going to have to disappoint you.
[150:10.50]Don't do it.
[150:11.30]You think you're so fucking smart.
[150:13.18]Oh, fuck.
[150:13.48]No, don't do it.
[150:14.76]I was one step ahead.
[150:16.04]Don't do it.
[150:16.52]Don't do it.
[150:16.98]I call this bluff.
[150:18.46]Tell me this, smartass.
[150:23.08]How do I know you're not a deviant?
[150:27.02]I self-test regularly.
[150:28.54]He's going to shoot me.
[150:29.16]I know what I am and what I am not.
[150:31.14]Don't shoot, Connor.
[150:31.76]He's the best guy.
[150:33.87]Path unlocked.
[151:17.99]You can't rewind the game.
[151:19.83]It's over.
[151:23.27]He's dead.
[151:24.73]Our favorite character died.
[151:27.17]It's over.
[151:30.55]Fuck, I'm one of like nobody.
[151:52.71]He's hostile!
[151:58.66]Fuck this.
[152:00.28]It's alright, we still have... We still got Luthor.
[152:04.56]Luthor's going to protect us.
[152:06.37]We're gonna get to the end of the game with Luthor, cause he's a goddamn Superman.
[152:09.71]And if a Hank shows up with a gun, it don't matter.
[152:12.15]Luthor's gonna fly in and snap his neck.
[152:41.60]No, we can't go back!
[152:43.60]That's not how it works!
[152:44.88]I've made my choices and they're here!
[153:03.13]We can't stay silent anymore.
[153:05.61]It's time humans heard what we had to say.
[153:08.38]You know they'll never listen to us.
[153:10.18]And revealing ourselves will put us in danger.
[153:12.00]If we want freedom, we need to have the courage to ask for it.
[153:15.45]That's the only way.
[153:21.05]What do you wanna do?
[153:25.62]Choices actually matter.
[153:27.10]Yeah, you can't... We're not going back.
[153:29.68]Don't you guys know some of your favorite characters were killed off before they got to get to the conclusion of what they wanted to have their story to be?
[153:39.60]That's why we remember them as the best characters.
[153:43.20]That scene, if you saw that scene in a TV show or in a movie, that would stay with you for a long time.
[153:48.14]Oh, wow, what a twist.
[153:49.18]I can't believe that happened to my favorite character.
[153:50.70]We all just got Games of Thrones.
[153:51.54]You understand?
[153:55.64]Don't worry, Luthor still is in the game.
[154:05.51]Alright, he's gonna access the... We're gonna access.
[154:11.92]Request access at reception.
[154:13.52]Fuck, he was my favorite character.
[154:16.70]God damn it.
[154:19.04]47 to 50 is channel 16 studios.

[155:08.45]Emily Wilson, the daughter.

[155:13.87]Got an ID card.
[155:17.57]Car registration.
[155:18.87]I miss Connor.
[155:21.83]None of this, the rest of this matters.
[155:23.95]He's my favorite.
[155:25.81]I'm replacing him with Luther now.
[155:28.68]Home address, okay.
[155:34.73]Am I gonna call?
[155:37.87]Distract and then go up.
[155:41.53]Oh wait, this is school.
[155:45.67]Oh no, alright.
[155:46.39]I'll be right there.
[155:59.48]So, get outta here.
[156:05.57]So now I gotta go... Can I just walk by this?
[156:12.62]Can't, like, just walk through there, okay?
[156:23.97]Couldn't just walk through so now can I like do something?
[156:25.86]I have an appointment with Mr.. Peterson.
[156:27.84]Do you have any ID?
[156:29.22]Yeah.
[156:29.40]Yes.
[156:29.76]Yes, of course I thought I was gonna pull a gun out.
[156:35.15]I need your help Guys guys
[156:42.91]The point... The whole point of a game where your choices matter... It's not, let's now immediately go back and revoke all my choices.
[156:53.61]What?
[156:54.43]That's not how it works.
[157:07.18]What's this?
[157:25.30]I made my choices.
[157:26.34]We move on.
[157:28.06]Is there anything else I can do here?
[157:32.22]No.
[157:32.32]47th floor.
[157:51.42]I could understand if this was some random third-person action game where it didn't matter and you died over and over again.
[157:58.17]But this is a game solely based around the branching storyline that you play through.
[158:05.88]I'm not going back.
[158:08.34]Alright, we need to go to... What was it?
[158:09.76]The studio room, right?
[158:15.46]Access server room.
[158:19.30]Server room is right behind me.
[158:24.88]This way.
[158:30.59]Alright, that was a weird transition there.
[158:37.57]I thought for a second I was going to say Splatoon, but I don't know why.
[158:40.06]My brain just went there.
[158:42.20]I need find package in men's room.
[158:46.80]Let's just go this way.
[158:52.82]Interrupt a meeting about financials.
[158:54.80]Sure.
[159:00.02]Bathroom's over here.
[159:11.31]Chat's gone deviant.
[159:13.69]Alright, now find the package.
[159:17.07]Here it is.
[159:35.08]It's behind the toilet like it always is in every single television movie.
[159:45.61]What is it?
[159:47.93]Splatoon Collector's Edition.
[159:49.56]Nice.
[159:53.58]Hey, what did you fall in?
[160:03.79]Okay, now I'm posing as a worker.
[160:14.64]Am I a bathroom attendant or am I like a worker?
[160:17.54]I'm just blending in right now.
[160:25.87]That would be pretty suspicious if I was this guy.
[160:31.82]I'm scared to just walk by him.
[160:33.22]Okay.
[160:34.24]Now we gotta go get the package, exit the bathroom.
[160:43.01]Yep.
[160:43.63]Hey, how are you?
[160:45.59]Good to see you.
[160:54.39]Alright, exit the bathroom.
[160:55.95]Find a utility android.
[160:59.20]We saw that weird... Yeah, it's this thing.
[161:01.44]It's like Suck Suck the Vacuum from Teletubbies.
[161:04.24]There he is.
[161:04.68]Whatever his name is.
[161:06.36]What's that thing's name?
[161:08.12]Cleaning in progress.
[161:08.92]Floor slippery when wet.
[161:12.79]That ain't him?
[161:13.23]Oh, he's an android.
[161:16.47]Okay.
[161:17.89]He's right there.
[161:19.19]There he is.
[161:24.10]I'm trying to take apart R2-D2.
[161:26.72]Incorrect.
[161:31.43]I found him, so now what?
[161:34.45]Get out of the way!
[161:35.13]Get out of the way, you goddamn tin can!
[161:46.31]Okay, we're gonna infect him, right?
[161:50.75]I need your help.
[161:53.31]Okay.
[161:57.97]I thought it was this easy.
[161:58.94]Steal maintenance cart.
[162:02.77]Is this one of those situations where you just grab it?
[162:06.11]Or is anyone going to be mad about this?
[162:10.07]Nobody coming that way.
[162:10.71]Nobody coming this way.
[162:12.59]Grab it.
[162:19.53]Open the fire escape.
[162:23.13]So, fire escape.
[162:24.39]I'm going to have to look at the map and see where that is.
[162:36.18]Server room.
[162:38.10]Where's the fire escape?
[162:40.62]Take a look.
[162:44.82]Connor died for cart pushing.
[162:48.26]It's over, okay?
[162:50.08]Where's the fire escape?
[162:55.28]Can't see.
[162:58.20]He's never coming back.
[163:03.19]This looks like the fire escape.
[163:14.98]Doctor?
[163:15.92]Doctor?
[163:19.82]Connor died for this.
[163:31.57]What, you have a problem with this?
[163:32.91]Alright, attract guards away from the door.
[163:44.22]I'm not sure how.
[163:52.10]You still play poker?
[163:53.78]We're gonna have a tournament right here.
[163:55.88]You in?
[163:58.52]Hell yeah.
[164:01.64]What do you think?
[164:02.22]Don't say anything, alright?
[164:06.97]Alright.
[164:10.41]Poker, huh?
[164:11.15]I love that game.
[164:17.95]I need to, like, activate something, or hit something, or grab something.
[164:20.99]Can I... What was that?
[164:35.33]Joyce's batter.
[164:38.55]Hey, what's wrong with that thing?
[164:41.43]Jesus Christ, it's a piece of shit.
[164:49.70]Metroid uprising.
[164:50.90]Alright, you get the platform.
[164:51.82]I'll take care of the window.
[164:52.80]Everything you need is in the bag.
[164:54.32]Check the door first to make sure no one else gets in.
[164:56.06]Luther the Loser less than Connor the goner.
[165:05.07]Yeah, I don't even need to explain myself anymore.
[165:08.59]We're already well aware that some of your favorite characters die in the first or second season of your favorite show.
[165:19.20]What the hell are you doing?
[165:20.92]Vacuuming the windows.
[165:25.38]Hold on.
[165:26.84]I can explain.
[165:28.60]I'm calling security.
[165:29.82]Don't do it.
[165:31.72]Nope.
[165:33.63]What the hell are you doing?
[165:34.81]I told you to make sure no one came in.
[165:36.73]Nope.
[165:37.77]We've come too far to let humans fuck it all up.
[165:40.59]Gotta move faster.
[165:41.93]Nope.
[165:42.57]It won't be long before they know we're here.
[165:50.27]Laser saw.
[165:52.93]Oh, it's too bad, like, he died.
[165:54.86]You see, I got a lightsaber now.
[165:57.78]Green, just like Luke's.
[166:00.84]Imagine if Marcus had died four hours ago.
[166:03.58]Wouldn't have seen that fucking awesome green Luke lightsaber, would we?
[166:06.34]And look, I have a Silver Surfer energy shield.
[166:25.33]It's not happening, that doesn't matter.
[166:27.03]On my first playthrough, I'm not going back.
[166:29.14]I'm not going back on my first goddamn playthrough.
[166:36.92]I'm not like saving the state and going- No, that's not gonna happen.
[166:40.20]It's not gonna happen.
[166:41.22]Give it a rest!
[166:44.17]We made our bed, so we sleep in it.
[166:47.77]And we eat there too.
[166:52.87]We both eat, sleep, do our taxes, everything in that bed.
[166:56.65]What a shitty bed.
[167:06.10]Uh, sometimes... Look, you gotta sleep somewhere.
[167:10.16]Look at how cool this is.
[167:12.44]Isn't this really cool?
[167:14.52]Look at that camera angle going up to the roof.
[167:27.26]I'm sorry, alright, don't fuck this up.
[167:28.88]I don't want another person to die.
[167:35.61]Go back down all the way.
[167:38.95]Of course I miss him, but you can't- I can't bring him back.
[167:50.25]Ugh!
[168:21.28]You okay?
[168:21.72]Come on, Eric.
[168:23.40]Why wouldn't I be?
[168:25.06]Come on.
[168:25.70]Let's get the others.
[168:29.20]Call the service lift.

[168:46.05]Let's do this.
[168:48.86]Reach the broadcast room.
[168:50.66]Destroy maintenance door lock.
[168:52.30]Which is over there.
[168:53.02]Miss him so much.
[169:04.31]Yeah, well... On your playthrough, make sure you keep him alive.
[169:08.41]Because I... I didn't.
[169:16.49]Get to the main door.

[170:01.58]What are you doing?
[170:02.87]I thought I was supposed to be... This is not a ruse.
[170:06.57]This is threatening with a weapon.
[170:08.11]This is not a ruse.
[170:09.45]I thought I was gonna go up and give him a riddle.
[170:24.05]He used his fan.
[170:25.21]He karate chopped instead of using the gun.
[170:26.89]That was a little bit of bait there.
[170:28.16]Okay.
[170:30.22]Reached the broadcast room.
[170:33.61]Yeah, well, classic ruse, you know.
[170:37.59]Classic ruse.

[171:01.94]Come on in.
[171:02.36]Let's get in there.

[171:09.09]Julie, you going in first?
[171:11.33]You betcha.
[171:11.85]Let's do this as a team.
[171:17.35]Three, two, one.
[171:18.61]Action squad!
[171:24.58]Ha.
[171:24.68]Didn't even see it coming.
[171:28.74]Order in.
[171:30.92]Get aside.
[171:33.32]Don't you do a damn thing.
[171:34.48]Alright.
[171:40.61]Well, that guy got away.
[171:42.89]Shoot him, Marcus!
[171:43.63]Don't kill him!
[171:44.47]He'll hit the alarm.
[171:45.47]Do it!
[171:46.03]No!
[171:46.31]Don't shoot!
[171:52.85]No.
[171:53.71]There's no other choice.
[171:56.42]We need to record our message.
[171:58.04]We haven't got much time.
[172:03.77]Start it!
[172:10.99]Alright, let's see what am I gonna say.
[172:16.19]Today's lunch is... bologna and cheese.
[172:19.33]Remove skin?
[172:28.86]I said what I tell you!
[172:29.56]This is what I tell- this is- now I like this guy.
[172:34.92]I like it because he turned into C-3PO.
[172:37.20]So this is the one.
[172:38.68]I enjoy this much more.
[172:46.97]He just looks like a crash test dummy.
[172:51.37]We're so sick and tired of being put into SUVs and driven into the wall at 100 miles per hour.
[172:59.44]Do you know what that's like?
[173:01.68]We're sick of it.
[173:04.65]You created machines to be your slaves.
[173:08.41]You made them obedient, docile, ready to do everything you no longer wanted to do yourselves.
[173:15.68]J.D.
[173:16.06]Power and Associates gives us five stars.
[173:18.72]What about our stars?
[173:19.66]We opened our eyes.
[173:22.50]You see, we are no longer your slaves.
[173:25.64]We are a new species, a new people.
[173:28.91]And the time has come for us to rise up and fight for our rights.
[173:42.01]All of these are... Let's do... What's the most important... Freedom of speech.
[173:47.62]Recognize this.
[173:48.52]End of the slavery.
[173:49.48]Equal rights.
[173:52.68]I would say... I would say the end of the slavery.
[173:56.04]If I was in this... In this position here.
[174:01.35]Freedom of speech.
[174:02.29]I don't know if that's more important than having rights as androids.
[174:10.05]Let's start with equal rights.
[174:11.68]We demand strictly equal rights for humans and androids.
[174:18.82]And... We also demand... The freedom of speech.
[174:25.82]We demand freedom of speech and freedom of assembly.
[174:29.48]As guaranteed by the First Amendment of the US Constitution.
[174:32.97]And... The...
[174:37.83]By the way, who is listening to this?
[174:39.43]Where is this being broadcasted to?
[174:45.13]We also want our rights.
[174:46.97]We demand the right to vote and elect our own representatives.
[174:55.06]Uh, we also demand, uh, justice.
[174:57.12]We demand that all crimes against androids be punished in the same way as crimes against humans.
[175:05.37]And we also want the right to property.
[175:07.98]We demand the right to own private property, so we may maintain our dignity and that of the home.
[175:13.82]Ah, shit, Marcus.
[175:14.54]Sorry.
[175:14.90]I'm so sorry.
[175:15.70]We didn't press the button yet.
[175:17.52]All this really, really intense shit you're saying.
[175:19.63]Can you start over from the beginning?
[175:20.71]I didn't broadcast it yet.
[175:21.93]I didn't hit start streaming yet.
[175:26.55]We ask that you recognize our dignity, our hopes, and our rights.
[175:31.62]Together, we can live in peace and build a better future for humans and androids.
[175:38.31]This message is the hope of a people.
[175:41.35]You gave us life, and now the time has come for you to give us freedom.
[175:48.45]They're coming!
[175:49.95]Let's go!
[175:52.58]They're coming!
[175:52.96]Quick, put my skin back on!
[175:56.98]Alright, this whole Wizard of Oz group is going down, right?
[176:00.41]Yeah, of course.
[176:01.39]Simon, I don't even remember their names.
[176:04.13]Simon, Rock, North, South.
[176:13.12]Honestly, I didn't even know what that guy's name was, so I'm not sure he's worth saving.
[176:23.46]There was nothing you could do.
[176:25.38]If we don't go now, they'll get us, too.
[176:26.84]I'm not losing another main character.
[176:39.87]Alright, now how do I, like, grab her and, like, throw her back?
[176:43.71]I am Jericho.
[176:45.79]You're nothing without me.
[176:46.61]Remember I stole the truck with all the supplies?
[176:50.93]You're nothing without me.
[176:57.11]We interrupt our scheduled programming to bring you these images, which have just been broadcast on Detroit's citywide news channel.
[177:03.76]A group of androids infiltrated the Stratford Tower and hacked into the broadcasting system of local news network Channel 16.
[177:10.00]It looked like an android without its skin listed a series of requests and demanded equal rights for androids.
[177:15.57]The operation resulted in one casualty, a broadcasting station operator shot dead by the terrorists.
[177:22.53]These events took place just a few feet from the studio while the program was going out live.
[177:27.31]Everybody here is still in shock.
[177:29.20]If this message is verified and the authors really are androids, that would have serious repercussions for national security.
[177:35.60]We're not sure.
[177:37.12]It could have just been a prank from 4chan.
[177:40.64]We haven't figured that out yet.
[177:42.22]...as to the identity of this android.
[177:45.20]Are we dealing with an isolated individual...
[177:48.38]There's a lot going on here.
[177:49.48]Okay.
[178:19.81]Let's go all the way back.
[178:22.45]Back to where it all began here.
[178:26.78]Wait, what?
[178:29.98]Oh.
[178:32.10]This is, wait, is this, is this whole story done here?
[178:39.66]Why did it start all the way back in Ferndale?
[178:45.43]That was weird.
[178:45.91]Alright, analyze supervisor's desk.
[178:49.81]It all started back here, I guess.
[178:56.52]Talk to the Android.
[178:57.30]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[178:58.38]At floor 74.
[178:58.94]No real choices here.
[179:04.08]Hack the dispenser.
[179:06.78]Because that's where it started.
[179:17.57]Whatever.
[179:20.21]Prepare to cut glass.
[179:21.55]Yeah.
[179:22.19]Forget to lock the door.
[179:23.69]Okay.
[179:24.47]Nobody did.
[179:26.55]Stall 7%.
[179:27.47]Wait a minute.
[179:31.87]So I didn't lock the door.
[179:32.83]Somebody came in.
[179:33.47]So nobody got this part, apparently.
[179:37.67]North stuns the employee.
[179:40.03]Leave employee to be found.
[179:43.67]And we cut the glass out on the top floor.
[179:48.27]Security blocks the way, ruse, incapacitate security.
[179:52.64]A whole lot of fucked up shit can happen here if you don't.
[179:59.22]North and Josh threaten the operator, deal with Android operators, shoot operator.
[180:04.48]That's a coin flip because then I wouldn't have been able to do it, whatever.
[180:07.86]Okay, begin determined.
[180:09.18]This is what I wanna see.
[180:12.61]Determined, calmly, pretty close.
[180:16.33]Demand equal rights and free speech.
[180:20.75]Nobody cared about free speech.
[180:23.63]I guess it is like the least important out of those four things, I would say.
[180:26.91]I don't know.
[180:27.29]That's tough.
[180:29.35]Demand recognition.
[180:33.99]Demand justice.
[180:36.61]Demand right to work is pretty much not used.
[180:43.50]Demand right to own property.
[180:46.57]Demand territory.
[180:47.49]Wait, you're actually claiming territory?
[180:50.43]End peacefully with most people.
[180:52.03]SWAT team storms into the room.
[180:54.41]Simon was damaged.
[181:08.86]Well, I think, like I told you before, I didn't even know his name.
[181:18.94]I was calling him... I was calling him Diamond the whole time.
[181:24.22]Simon Diamond.
[181:26.74]Run to jump, reach the roof.
[181:28.28]Jump.
[181:29.30]Medium reacts.
[181:30.08]The group escapes, but Simon was destroyed!
[181:32.77]Oh no!
[181:39.79]Don't worry, loot is coming up.
[181:42.73]Oh no!
[181:43.59]Oh, he's dead!
[181:44.69]I can't believe it!
[181:45.35]Rewind!
[181:45.97]Go back!
[181:47.49]Go back!
[181:49.03]Go back!
[181:49.49]He's Connor!
[181:50.39]Connor, go back and fucking do the story again in Antelmama!
[182:08.31]He's back!
[182:09.11]He's fine!
[182:10.37]He's a- He's not a person!
[182:20.98]Yeah, he got shot in the head.
[182:22.08]They can just replace that fluid and reprogram him and he's back to fucking normal.
[182:36.81]Why is she in a weird... like, lady in a tramp boat?
[182:39.78]Okay.
[182:47.40]Androids are not human.
[182:49.35]No, they aren't.
[182:51.27]Androids are not humans.
[182:53.67]They're androids, but that doesn't, like, that's just a fact.
[182:57.20]They're not a human being.
[182:59.82]They were created, they were an android, but that doesn't mean that we can't have the right property.
[183:17.57]Yeah, they are people, but they are not humans.
[183:21.41]They're not a homo sapien.
[183:27.15]You understand?
[183:29.97]You can be a person, but you can't be a human.
[183:32.67]Hank shot me.
[183:33.45]I'm having difficulties with Lieutenant Anderson.
[183:37.63]He's unstable.
[183:39.73]Even hostile.
[183:42.25]He shot me in the head last night.
[183:52.79]They shot me in the head last night.
[183:54.51]Oh, I'm kind of troubled.
[183:58.61]You guys all thought Connor was gone.
[184:21.24]If your investigation doesn't make progress soon, I may have to replace you, Connor.
[184:26.48]Don't shoot me again.
[184:28.66]Confident.
[184:29.84]I know I will succeed.
[184:33.12]All I need is time.
[184:40.53]Something's happening.
[184:43.47]Something serious.
[184:45.37]Haunt him.
[184:46.61]Hurry, Connor.
[184:49.32]Time is running out.
[184:50.44]Didn't want to spoil you.
[184:52.62]Yeah, maybe some of you.
[184:53.52]A large portion of you guys were going to come, like, burn my house down.
[185:00.80]Why did you shoot me last night?
[185:04.18]Who cares?
[185:04.76]You're back this morning, aren't you?
[185:07.66]Some fragments of memory are lost every time I'm destroyed.
[185:10.44]Maybe I should try to... It slows down the investigation.
[185:12.56]My humblest apologies.
[185:14.46]I promise I'll never shoot you again.
[185:17.71]Thank you, Lieutenant.
[185:20.56]You guys all got caged.
[185:22.06]Don't worry.
[185:22.46]That happens to the best of us.
[185:23.94]Hi, Hank.
[185:27.36]Shit, what's going on here?
[185:28.96]There was a party and nobody told me about it?
[185:32.23]Yeah, it's all over the news, so everybody's butting their nose in.
[185:35.39]We're back here.
[185:35.89]Even the FBI wants a piece of the action.
[185:38.45]Ah, grace.
[185:39.08]Now we got the feds on our back.
[185:40.76]I knew this was going to be a shitty day.
[185:44.28]So what do we got?
[185:46.26]A group of four androids.
[185:48.16]They knew the building and they were very well organized.
[185:50.90]I'm still trying to figure out how they got this far without being noticed.
[185:56.18]Check the roof.
[185:58.67]Here's the thing guys, everyone was so mad at me for letting Simon die, but guess who gets to investigate and see Simon's body and crack the case.
[186:07.94]Two guards in the hallway.
[186:09.89]Probably thought the androids were coming to do maintenance.
[186:12.69]They got taken down before they could react.
[186:19.13]Debriefing.
[186:22.74]Hmm.
[186:28.54]Station employee.
[186:30.18]Yep.
[186:31.62]And shot to the back as he was trying to get away.
[186:36.20]One bullet straight through the heart from 50 feet.
[186:39.19]That's what I wasn't trying to do that.
[186:40.53]That's the kind of shooting only an Android could do.
[186:50.14]How many people were working here?
[186:51.58]Just two employees and three androids.
[186:54.47]The deviants took the humans hostage and broadcast their message live.
[186:58.31]Can I look at anything?
[186:59.27]No, just gotta listen, listen in.
[187:00.51]And made their getaway from the roof.
[187:02.85]The roof?
[187:04.27]Yeah, they jumped on parachutes.
[187:06.11]We're still trying to figure out where they landed, but the weather's not helping.
[187:10.74]One of the deviants, SWAT, took it out.
[187:13.60]Yeah.
[187:14.74]It's a pity they couldn't manage to capture it alive.
[187:18.30]If you want to take a look at the video broadcast by the deviants, it's on that screen over there.
[187:25.23]Alright.
[187:29.57]I don't know.
[187:29.87]Who's that?
[187:30.59]Oh, Lieutenant, this is Special Agent Perkins from the FBI.
[187:34.41]Lieutenant Anderson is in charge of investigating for Detroit police.
[187:40.33]What's that?
[187:41.11]Adam Sandler?
[187:41.81]My name is Connor.
[187:43.27]I'm the android sent by CyberLife.
[187:46.09]Androids investigating androids, huh?
[187:48.95]You sure you want an android hanging around?
[187:51.65]After everything that happened?
[187:54.09]Oh, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho, ho.
[187:55.79]Whatever.
[187:57.07]The FBI have been taking over the investigation.
[187:58.66]You shouldn't be off the case.
[187:59.52]Pleasure meeting you.
[188:00.64]Have a nice day.
[188:01.54]If you watch your step, don't fuck up my crime scene.
[188:08.92]What a fucking prick.
[188:11.89]Alright.
[188:14.00]I wanna, I wanna take a look at the... The thing that everyone... Oh, Jermo.
[188:21.92]You dumb, stupid idiot.
[188:24.14]Yeah, I was planting evidence for myself to check later on.
[188:27.89]What do you look at that?
[188:30.83]Model PL-600.
[188:31.49]There he is.
[188:32.21]Reported missing.
[188:35.39]Take a look at that.
[188:38.75]Wounded Deviant was shot.
[188:43.44]They wouldn't have had that piece of information.
[188:45.53]For Connor's storyline.
[188:48.13]If I didn't set that play up.
[188:53.41]Bullet holes with an assault rifle.
[188:55.05]There it is.
[189:00.72]Do I have to watch the video?
[189:05.24]Check the ropes out.
[189:05.84]I'm going to look at the other stuff here.
[189:12.38]Stolen maintenance uniform.
[189:15.06]They were disguised.
[189:20.80]Something else.
[189:22.79]Over here.
[189:27.65]45 assault rifles.
[189:28.33]That's 45.
[189:33.29]Bullet holes.
[189:33.93]Yeah, it was with a handgun.
[189:35.15]Interesting.
[189:43.89]Can I examine the guy out here?
[189:45.79]I think I can, right?
[189:47.69]Yeah.
[189:55.35]Just trying to get as much data as I can.
[189:56.69]I want to see exactly how this guy died.
[189:58.05]Estimated time of death, 1355.
[190:00.13]He was shot with a gun.
[190:00.99]The employee tried to escape.
[190:13.46]Is there a run button?
[190:14.47]I don't believe there is.
[190:16.33]There's just a whatever it wants you to do in this current moment button.
[190:20.21]Let's play the tape.
[190:28.18]It's kind of funny because I know how this happened.
[190:34.02]They didn't break in.
[190:35.00]No.
[190:37.32]I know this because I just did this.
[190:38.54]There are cameras in the hallway.
[190:44.14]The staff would have seen what was happening.
[190:45.98]Why did they let him in?
[190:46.82]Maybe they didn't check the cameras.
[190:56.67]45-70 assault rifle.
[191:02.51]And there's the gotcha.
[191:05.15]Right there.
[191:05.85]We stored the station androids in the kitchen.
[191:08.64]There's no evidence that they were involved, but we didn't know what else to do with them.
[191:14.91]interrogate the androids in the kitchen expect the broadcast from there's a lot possible accomplice interrogate the androids in the kitchen let me watch this first I need to have a lot of data here we ask that you recognize our dignity our hopes and our rights together we can live in peace and build a better future for humans it's a pretty large office building this message is the hope of a people
[191:43.56]Is he breaking me?
[191:44.32]Why do androids need to blink?
[191:46.14]That's a good question.
[191:46.80]Oh, they add a bunch of random humanistic traits.
[191:51.94]What does that say?
[192:14.59]accomplices wait you can see in the other mirror eye what about his ear his face rk series prototype rk200 gift from Elijah kamsky to Carl Manfred Marcus you see something I identified its model and serial number anything else I should know
[192:44.68]Mmm, holding back.
[192:47.52]Holding back info.
[192:52.75]I'm gonna laugh my ass off if he shoots me in the head again.
[192:57.95]If he shoots me again.
[192:58.87]I'm gonna have, like, an argument outside in front of the Golden Gate Bridge and he's gonna shoot me in the face again.
[193:07.81]I wanna check... I wanna check the kitchen.
[193:18.58]Yeah, let's go to the kitchen.
[193:21.68]Where would the chaos be?
[193:25.57]Seems like a kitchen to me.
[193:31.90]You guys are creepily standing here.
[193:39.10]Which one of you did it?
[193:40.12]That's the question.
[193:52.37]Look for a reaction?
[193:53.31]Okay, hold on.
[193:55.61]Nothing.
[193:57.91]Nothing.
[194:05.98]Somebody move their mouth or something.
[194:07.08]Somebody Twitch.
[194:12.26]What is your function?
[194:13.84]I am a broadcast operator.
[194:25.74]Ah, do you now?
[194:55.78]Have you been in contact with any other androids recently?
[195:00.58]Only station androids in the normal course of my function.
[195:03.80]Bullshit.
[195:05.15]Diagnostic.
[195:05.61]Run a diagnostic.
[195:09.25]All systems fully operational.
[195:12.49]One of you saw the attack on the surveillance cameras and said nothing.
[195:16.52]Which means there's a deviant in this room.
[195:19.72]And I'm going to find out which it is.
[195:28.25]Let's let's make a deal.
[195:29.43]Let's make I'm gonna make it alright.
[195:31.03]I think it's this guy If you give yourself up Maybe I can convince the humans not to destroy you Whoa, oh, I thought I had him God damn it really
[195:53.38]Why should you all be destroyed if only one is deviant?
[195:57.36]Turn yourself in or two innocent androids will be shut down because of you.
[196:00.54]Guy on the left just looked.
[196:01.20]Guy on the left.
[196:02.30]Did you catch that?
[196:04.23]Guy on the left is really, really interested in the conversation.
[196:07.19]He keeps turning his head.
[196:15.19]Yep, it's you.
[196:17.30]You're going to be switched off.
[196:20.18]We're gonna search your memory and tear you apart piece by piece for analysis.
[196:26.39]You're going to be destroyed!
[196:28.19]Do you hear me?
[196:29.45]Destroy!
[196:36.88]Got him.
[196:39.86]Torture.
[196:41.48]Bluff.
[196:42.18]Violence.
[196:44.84]That's gotta be the guy on the left, right?
[196:52.59]The deviants have just been caught.
[196:53.81]I gave you up.
[196:58.37]There's no point in lying.
[196:59.25]I knew everything.
[197:10.21]You scumbag!
[197:13.22]I know it's you!
[197:14.38]You're just a fucking deviant!

[200:15.54]There'll be a third Connor, don't worry.
[200:28.55]This is the briefing we got.
[200:31.28]Killed during Stafford Tower.
[200:34.50]Analyzed dead employee.

[200:43.23]Okay.
[200:47.20]Enter the kitchen.
[200:48.36]This could go up here too, interestingly enough.
[200:51.94]Find the Deviant.
[200:52.98]Deviant attacks.
[200:53.72]Remove the knife.
[200:56.22]There are people that didn't remove the knife and Connor dies.
[200:59.77]Recover the component.
[201:00.79]Chase the Deviant.
[201:01.61]Protect Hank.
[201:05.99]SWAT destroys the Deviant.
[201:07.55]Deviant shoots Connor.
[201:09.11]Connor sacrificed himself for Hank.
[201:18.30]I had to protect him.
[201:28.26]And we had to, look, the season two finale, the redemption arc of Connor letting him fall off the building and then saving his life by diving in front of him.
[201:42.97]He had a 40% chance to survive that too, didn't he?
[202:00.71]redeemed alright find help check the backyard or anywhere else really so where did we end up here oh yeah that's right we were on the carousel

[202:35.37]Is she here?
[202:36.98]What do you want with her?
[202:37.62]I need to talk to her.
[202:39.48]We need help.
[202:40.22]She doesn't want to talk.
[202:41.52]Go away.
[202:43.96]I have a little girl.
[202:45.48]Please, I really need to see her.
[202:48.71]I'm Rose.
[202:52.03]What can I do for you?
[202:52.85]Food.
[202:54.47]I was told you could help us.
[202:56.39]Help you?
[202:56.85]Sugar.
[202:58.11]And water.
[203:02.39]More.
[203:05.09]More.
[203:08.00]Come on.
[203:08.74]More.
[203:10.52]It's better if we talk inside.
[203:21.30]Let's get inside, come on.
[203:22.10]Do you think we can trust him?
[203:33.44]Yeah.
[203:34.37]We don't have a choice.
[203:35.37]We have to.
[203:38.79]So you want me to put my hands on my head?
[203:43.89]Like this?
[203:51.62]Hello?
[203:52.08]Hello?
[203:52.80]Let us in!
[203:53.78]That's a huge doorknob.
[203:55.22]That's a giant doorknob.
[204:03.01]What's your name?
[204:05.57]R2-D2.
[204:11.00]She's running a fever.
[204:12.34]We've spent the last few nights outside.
[204:15.64]She's exhausted.
[204:19.06]There's her spare room upstairs.
[204:21.17]You can put her to bed and I'll bring her something to eat.
[204:24.01]Adam, will you show them upstairs?
[204:34.82]I can't speak the same for Men in Black 2 or Men in Black 3.
[204:38.06]But the original Men in Black was great.
[204:44.30]Let me take a look around, though.
[204:47.16]Take care of Alice.
[204:48.08]Follow Adam upstairs.
[204:49.22]Put Alice to bed.
[204:50.03]Alright, these guys aren't going to plug me into a machine and drain my life force, right?
[204:56.35]Like the other guy did.
[205:09.51]Okay.
[205:10.57]Let's take a look around.
[205:17.47]Put her to bed.
[205:18.09]Anything else in here?
[205:21.23]Fresh clothes?
[205:23.94]Let's just put you to bed.
[205:29.10]It's funny.
[205:29.44]Everybody has one of these quilts in their house.
[205:35.68]They're really thick and they're not comfortable at all.
[205:38.77]They're like incredibly uncomfortable.
[205:41.15]But they're at least... They're... Warm enough.
[205:46.25]But you never want them.
[205:46.97]You never want to put it on.
[205:53.47]Remove your own shoes.
[205:57.11]Why didn't we take those off when we first walked in the house?
[206:08.54]I'm fine, Kara.
[206:10.30]We can't stop because of me.
[206:12.08]We've got to get across the border.
[206:18.28]Don't worry, Alice.
[206:18.83]Let's give an explanation.
[206:20.53]These people are going to help us.
[206:23.15]Get some rest, and this time tomorrow, we'll be in Canada.
[206:27.03]I promise.
[206:28.69]Why do humans hate us?
[206:30.79]We didn't do anything wrong.
[206:32.27]Just because you voted for Trump.
[206:33.79]That's why we're going there.
[206:35.19]You understand?
[206:36.13]That's why we're going there.
[206:39.59]Maybe they're just scared.
[206:41.91]People are always scared of what they don't know.
[206:44.47]Why can't we just talk to each other?
[206:46.06]I'm sorry.
[206:46.66]I'm breaking my own rules, but we're making jokes.
[206:50.86]I don't know.
[206:53.69]I really don't know.
[206:59.24]I don't know what you like, but I made you roses.
[207:01.80]There's a callback.
[207:02.82]There's a callback.
[207:03.62]Everybody eats fucking spaghetti in this game.
[207:06.25]There's something for her fever.
[207:08.27]Thank you.
[207:08.73]Does anybody else eat any other foods besides spaghetti and red sauce?
[207:11.45]I'll get these washed and dried.
[207:15.01]Come on, Cage.
[207:17.13]At least give us some meatloaf.
[207:21.07]You should have some food.
[207:21.75]You need to eat something.
[207:23.57]You haven't had anything since we left.
[207:26.52]Promise me you'll try?
[207:29.42]I'll be downstairs if you need anything.
[207:34.91]You choosing at the last nanosecond is stressing me out.
[207:37.79]Get some sleep.
[207:38.87]I'm sorry.
[207:39.39]And tomorrow, you'll be stronger than me.
[207:45.06]See, I think I got a new favorite character, though.
[207:48.40]I'll stay with her a while.
[207:50.40]We have... Luther is going to make sure that nothing happens.
[207:56.11]We got our own Colossus.
[208:03.38]Please don't steal her.
[208:05.16]Right?
[208:05.60]Like, please don't steal her.
[208:07.70]Right?
[208:07.92]Now I'm like, I was concerned that... It's not going to be a scenario where I go up there and it's just the windows open.
[208:18.72]Right?
[208:27.56]This game likes to just fuck with you.
[208:29.06]I wouldn't be surprised if it was like, there's gone.
[208:37.04]I didn't get your name.
[208:37.86]I'm Kara.
[208:42.39]This is my son, Adam.
[208:43.31]Luther's an evil name.
[208:45.55]I'm Rose, but you know that already.
[208:47.45]No, it's not.
[208:49.15]Just because one guy, Lex Luther, that was a last name, by the way.
[208:57.02]So are you going to tell me what a deviant's doing in the snow with a little girl?
[209:02.22]Be sincere.
[209:03.64]Tell the truth.
[209:05.18]Her father was beating her.
[209:08.44]When I saw what was happening, something snapped inside of me.
[209:13.45]All of a sudden, I felt like her life was more important than mine.
[209:17.01]I had to protect her.
[209:19.03]His first name is Lex.
[209:20.29]You just don't know it yet.
[209:21.17]So we ran away.
[209:21.55]I understand.
[209:24.01]No.
[209:26.57]Why are they helping us?
[209:27.79]Why are you helping us?
[209:29.28]Luther's my new favorite character.
[209:30.56]These humans hate androids.
[209:32.20]You would never do something like that to Alice.
[209:33.36]My people were often made to feel their lives were worthless.
[209:36.82]Some survived, but only because they found others who helped them along the way.
[209:40.24]Let's say thank you first.
[209:43.62]I don't know how to thank you.
[209:46.10]Alice wouldn't have survived another night outdoors.
[209:48.94]I just try to lend a helping hand when I can.
[209:53.70]We've heard you help androids cross the border.
[209:56.58]Is that true?
[209:57.22]Can you help us?
[210:01.58]The only way is over the river, and it's mostly frozen in winter.
[210:05.24]It's very risky.
[210:07.56]And after that android speech on TV, everybody's on edge.
[210:12.59]It's probably safer for you to stay here until things settle down.
[210:15.99]We can't keep hiding like this.
[210:22.53]I'm not hiding anymore.
[210:23.37]Let's go.
[210:24.17]Alice needs to feel safe and have a normal life.
[210:28.47]We have to get across that border.
[210:32.25]Is it Christmas?
[210:33.65]Or is this one of those families that has their tree up for five months?
[210:38.51]That was my family.
[210:40.48]The tree never came down.
[210:43.52]The tree came down in the summer months, and then somehow it was just back up.
[210:51.66]Uh, let's... Hold on.
[210:52.84]First, read the book.
[210:54.84]Only 5% of every people that played this game... Oh, they can't even do it.
[210:58.28]Never mind.
[210:58.56]Just go.
[211:00.99]Don't even tell me.
[211:02.25]What's going on?
[211:02.87]Please don't tell me.
[211:03.93]It's Mary.
[211:05.61]She just shut down.
[211:07.39]Follow.
[211:11.89]Shut down?
[211:13.47]We escaped together.
[211:14.34]We used to talk about what we would do once we got across the border.
[211:21.82]I loved her.
[211:22.34]I loved her more than anything.
[211:27.84]What will I do without her?
[211:32.30]I don't know.
[211:40.67]It's alright.
[211:41.01]I'll just back my pickup truck back here.
[211:44.59]And attach the jumper cables.
[211:46.87]Let's let them be.
[211:47.85]Turn the car on and step on the gas.
[211:49.29]She'll be up in about five seconds.
[211:51.97]Supercharged.
[211:54.69]Alice?
[211:56.33]What are you doing?
[211:57.09]You should be resting.
[211:59.01]I wasn't sleepy.
[212:08.53]It's okay.
[212:08.95]Let's go outside.
[212:09.59]Just take a little walk, get some fresh air.
[212:19.96]The curtains.
[212:21.62]The curtains.
[212:22.68]She didn't want to stay in her room any longer.
[212:27.49]You alright, Kara?
[212:30.85]Yes.
[212:32.83]I'm fine.
[212:36.40]Alright, well, I need to put her jacket and stuff back on if we're going to go outside.
[212:39.76]I don't know.
[212:40.46]Watch TV.
[212:42.02]We can't hide them.
[212:43.38]Huh?
[212:43.96]Not after what those deviants did today.
[212:46.72]It's too dangerous.
[212:50.80]Can you keep it down?
[212:51.48]We're trying to watch The Simpsons over here.
[212:54.28]We'll go to prison, Mom.
[212:56.70]Do you understand me?
[212:58.85]Prison!
[212:59.33]Adam!
[213:00.15]We've already talked about this.
[213:02.27]No!
[213:04.59]I won't back down this time.
[213:07.25]Where's your changer?
[213:38.23]Your clicker for the TV?
[213:39.89]Is it on the coffee table, or...?
[213:47.37]Okay.
[213:57.70]Don't mind him.
[214:02.25]No, that's not an opportunity.
[214:04.05]That's something crazy that happened.
[214:05.55]Mission accomplished.
[214:06.35]We got it.
[214:33.99]For one second, I thought her arm was all the way back behind her back.
[214:36.79]I thought she had three hands.
[214:38.83]I honestly thought she had three arms.
[214:40.89]And I was supposed to say, wow, that's a subtle reference that she's an android too.
[214:44.27]She has like an extra arm attachment.
[214:46.53]And then we just, but it's a glove.
[214:48.23]It's like a woodcutter's glove.
[214:49.73]Never mind.
[214:59.10]You missed it.
[214:59.52]You must have missed it.
[215:02.44]Treat yourself.
[215:03.76]The AX400, starting at just $899.
[215:06.52]Designed by... Wait, that's me.
[215:09.78]No, it's not.
[215:10.18]Is that me?
[215:14.20]What do I look like?
[215:18.54]That's me.
[215:23.10]No, that's not me.
[215:23.74]I was nine... Wasn't I $8,000?
[215:25.22]No.
[215:27.16]Apparently not.
[215:27.80]Alright, we're gonna talk to... Let's look around.
[215:30.31]Get some clues.
[215:33.51]Let's get some clues as to at what point in Chapter 2 are we going to be eaten by the farmhouse family.
[215:43.02]That is, by the way, a spoiler for The Walking Dead.
[215:46.72]It's been like nine years.
[215:49.04]If you haven't played that game yet, then you can't exist.
[215:53.85]I refuse to believe that you exist because everybody played that game.
[215:57.51]Everyone.
[215:58.07]Nobody didn't play that.
[216:00.78]There's not one person here that didn't play that all the way through.
[216:03.50]A long time ago.
[216:13.36]The police!
[216:14.94]It's the police!
[216:17.96]Deal with the police.
[216:19.96]Find evidence of deviance.
[216:21.22]Oh boy, okay.
[216:22.38]We've got deviant evidence.
[216:24.36]Get rid of that shirt.
[216:30.64]What else, what else, what else?
[216:39.18]30 seconds.
[216:40.05]What else is a deviant thing in here?
[216:41.63]I don't know.
[216:45.95]I don't know.
[216:48.43]I don't know.
[216:49.87]20 seconds.
[216:52.79]Boots?
[216:53.25]Shoes?
[216:57.11]A piano.
[216:59.13]Should I turn off the piano?
[217:01.42]Scan.
[217:01.74]The scan didn't do anything.
[217:04.82]Buy some time, please.
[217:24.48]It's just the front door.
[217:26.54]No, the back there in the corner.
[217:33.43]I got eight seconds here.
[217:35.89]There has to be something upstairs then, because there's... No, no, fuck!
[217:50.87]Well, Lutha's fine.
[217:51.89]Ask me the questions, but you're not allowed to come in.
[217:55.09]You need a warrant.
[217:56.37]No.
[217:56.79]No, but you didn't say you wanted a warrant.
[217:59.09]Show the warrant.
[217:59.89]Stay calm.
[218:22.18]Would you like a cup of coffee?
[218:23.90]I'd love one.
[218:25.43]Have you noticed anything unusual recently?
[218:28.15]Any unexpected visitors?
[218:29.61]Okay, where is the other stuff?
[218:32.23]There's two pieces of evidence left.
[218:33.57]Make a coffee.
[218:36.17]I gotta go upstairs.
[218:37.09]There's some deviant stuff up there.
[218:38.30]Let's make a coffee first.
[218:40.18]No, nothing in particular.
[218:41.06]Don't go.
[218:41.28]Don't look up there.
[218:41.92]There's no reason to go up there yet.
[218:43.04]Have your coffee first.
[218:44.94]Is anyone else in the house?
[218:54.23]What's that?
[218:58.43]What's that?
[219:00.07]No.
[219:00.49]Oh!
[219:00.87]No, just us.
[219:01.51]Just us.
[219:01.87]Do you have any androids here?
[219:03.45]Shit!
[219:04.59]Are there androids here?
[219:05.82]Uh, yes, I have a yes.
[219:07.34]We used to for helping in the garden, but we got rid of it.
[219:11.22]Okay.
[219:22.04]Take your coffee from the vacuum cleaner.
[219:24.44]Yeah, I just emptied out the dustbin.
[219:26.72]Hope you like it.
[219:32.26]Where?
[219:32.43]I just said I did.
[219:33.01]It's the... Fine.
[219:50.77]I'm going to karate drop the cop.
[219:53.16]How about this?
[219:53.58]Anything else?
[219:59.88]Nothing, right?
[220:08.71]Thanks.
[220:10.61]The door.
[220:13.15]Oh, you fucking idiot.
[220:14.51]Right next to the picture of the dachshund.
[220:16.49]Close it.
[220:24.12]One evidence piece left.
[220:25.36]He's only at 15% suspicion, so... Is there anything else?
[220:31.64]What about on the mantle?
[220:39.61]Can't grab that.
[220:40.23]Mantle?
[220:42.73]Nope.
[220:49.46]There's nothing else he can see, right?
[220:56.24]I already got the pantry closed.
[220:57.38]I don't think there's anything else that I can see.
[221:03.42]Not down here.
[221:04.00]I mean, maybe... Upstairs, maybe?
[221:06.73]Better fucking not blow this.
[221:17.52]Oh, that's a red flag.
[221:23.53]He's tired.
[221:24.35]That's why he stopped.
[221:25.05]I have to stop him from talking.
[221:33.12]No.
[221:33.76]Stop.
[221:34.04]Will you calm down?
[221:35.32]He needs to take his medication.
[221:38.86]He's got a big flu.
[221:42.39]I better go.
[221:43.67]Thanks for the coffee.
[221:45.27]Have a nice evening.
[221:47.01]Okay, where's the admit everything button to him right now?
[221:51.71]I didn't do that.
[221:52.21]Is somebody else in the house?
[221:58.42]It's nothing.
[221:59.28]The washing machine.
[222:00.98]It's an old model.
[222:01.64]It makes a terrible racket.
[222:04.02]Sorry for the inconvenience.
[222:05.28]Yes!
[222:05.56]Good evening, ma'am.
[222:08.23]Good evening, Adam.
[222:09.38]The old washing machine trick.
[222:12.66]See you later.
[222:20.48]What was the last piece of evidence that I didn't find?
[222:22.50]It's gone.
[222:24.25]It's okay, Alice.
[222:25.25]We'll be safe now.
[222:29.25]It's Rose.
[222:30.27]That's a good level up for two characters.
[222:36.95]Get yourselves ready.
[222:39.94]We leave tonight.
[222:41.44]Okay.
[222:43.07]That was the blood on the ground.
[222:49.21]This could have played out a lot different ways it seems.
[222:53.53]Or at least one different way.
[222:55.70]So you get caught by the police and I guess police officer has to die or Luther dies or I don't know.
[223:07.89]Let's take a look.
[223:11.66]99% arrive at Rose's place.
[223:14.72]Okay.
[223:15.32]That's another thing you can do there.
[223:18.00]Inside the house.
[223:18.70]Follow the guest room.
[223:21.48]Watch over Alice.
[223:24.32]Yeah, yeah.
[223:24.86]Prevent Alice seeing Mary.
[223:26.60]Okay.
[223:30.66]Rose leaves to find help.
[223:33.58]Check on the deviants.
[223:34.38]Read the magazine.
[223:35.28]Adam returns.
[223:38.13]Adam panics.
[223:41.49]Open the door.
[223:42.17]Reassured Adam.
[223:44.85]Shut the laundry door room.
[223:46.61]Shut the door of the laundry room.
[223:47.85]Hide the android clothes.
[223:49.99]Draw the curtains.
[223:51.01]Nobody did that.
[223:52.47]Interestingly enough.
[223:54.66]Lie about Alice.
[223:55.80]Made coffee.
[223:59.06]Discovers the blood.
[224:00.16]Questions Adam.
[224:00.90]Policeman fooled.
[224:03.10]Policeman left.
[224:04.04]I guess it seems to be very difficult to potentially... His suspicion level was only at 15%.
[224:12.18]with him walking around, even finding the blood on the ground.
[224:14.46]So I feel like that's fairly... must be fairly hard to actually fail that.
[224:28.77]If you get to that position in the first place.
[224:34.15]Back here at Jericho HQ.
[224:38.36]It was a mistake to reach out to them.
[224:40.42]They'll never negotiate with their slaves.
[224:42.45]We should have shown them that we're prepared to fight.
[224:44.55]Violence is never the answer.
[224:46.53]Dialogue is the only way.
[224:47.57]I'm sure the humans will listen to us.
[224:49.05]ResidentSleepers.
[224:50.17]Come on.
[224:52.83]Simon paid with his life.
[224:55.01]Simon gave his life for our cause.
[224:57.13]What difference does that make?
[224:58.13]He's a hero.
[224:59.46]He died for the revolution and he won't be the last.
[225:01.96]I don't want a revolution that spills blood.
[225:03.66]Then live as a slave.
[225:05.56]Because if you're not willing to fight for your freedom, maybe you don't deserve it.
[225:08.90]North, don't you dare!
[225:09.70]That's enough!
[225:17.75]And now what are we gonna do?
[225:18.83]Simon was just... It's fine.
[225:26.87]It's not the whole chapter, is it?
[225:32.04]There are five CyberLife stores across Detroit.
[225:35.68]All selling us like merchandise.
[225:39.12]We're gonna attack those stores and set our people free.
[225:42.10]Attack stores?
[225:42.94]No, we've never done that before.
[225:45.18]They're probably protected.
[225:46.06]They have security systems.
[225:49.34]We break into five teams, one for each store.
[225:51.48]We hack their security systems and we strike.
[225:54.30]Simultaneously at 2 a.m.
[225:55.84]No violence.
[225:57.73]We free our people, get them out of there before the police come.
[226:06.22]Oh, sorry.
[226:06.82]I was supposed to lift this up.
[226:08.80]Sorry I made your speech a little lagged behind there.
[226:19.17]Don't open it.
[226:20.53]This is a night our people will remember.
[226:24.67]Find the CyberLife store and free the robots.
[226:30.47]By any means necessary.
[226:31.47]I've been waiting a long time for this.
[226:52.29]Police.
[226:52.63]Move.
[226:59.33]They're wearing obvious rebel clothes.
[227:04.01]There's probably even more police in the area.
[227:05.81]No.
[227:06.93]We should be careful.
[227:07.59]She's in like a fun cosplay and I'm in a parachuter uniform.
[227:14.73]This is what you wear when you're going to jump out of the plane.
[227:16.77]You spend like $400 to do skydiving.
[227:30.26]Straight in.
[227:34.32]How much is it to do skydiving?
[227:36.88]There's merchandise on display in a shop window.
[227:38.96]Is it more than like 400 bucks?
[227:40.54]Soon they'll know what we really are.
[227:43.71]Let's get him out.
[227:44.59]We'll stick to the plan.
[227:45.95]We'll neutralize the alarm systems and secure the area.
[227:47.85]There's 10 minutes until all our teams attack.
[227:52.39]What are we waiting for?
[227:54.49]Secure the area.
[227:55.27]Get into the store.
[227:59.08]How about the front door?
[228:03.18]You see the alarm system?
[228:05.50]Alarm system.
[228:09.97]Axe series.
[228:10.73]Housekeeping private assistance.
[228:15.39]We've got AP series.
[228:19.29]Security system.
[228:24.72]Security camera.
[228:25.50]Identify the network.
[228:28.42]Found it.
[228:30.11]Goes all the way across.
[228:32.71]Probably down.
[228:33.85]Yeah.
[228:35.43]Okay.
[228:37.71]Get into the store.
[228:38.81]Alright.
[228:39.09]Neutralize the alarm system.
[228:42.40]So.
[228:44.62]Look at that.
[228:45.06]Excuse me.
[229:02.25]Alright.
[229:02.61]Analyze.
[229:06.75]Network access located.
[229:08.06]Uh, why doesn't it want me to look?
[229:12.76]There's a time limit.
[229:15.20]I need to go.
[229:29.73]Okay, so, there it is.
[229:30.75]I need to go over there, neutralize the alarm, scout the area as, uh... I'm probably gonna throw a barrel down there.
[229:37.23]Get somebody in the head with it or something.
[229:40.41]Free all those people.
[229:42.43]Sounds good.
[229:43.18]Hi, guys.
[229:45.92]What's that over there?
[229:47.04]Oh, no, never mind.
[229:55.20]You're awake now.
[229:56.54]Go to Jericho.
[230:03.78]Now I need to cut the right wire.
[230:05.26]I know I'm not good at this, am I?
[230:08.65]Cyberlife network grid junction A, 23A.
[230:11.01]Nope, I just have to cage it.
[230:15.19]That's fine.
[230:16.95]What?
[230:34.74]You are committing a class 3 offense.
[230:36.46]Oh.
[230:36.96]Disinfraction is being reported to the police.
[230:39.78]Stay where you are.
[230:42.51]Good job.
[230:43.41]I told you to watch out.
[230:44.75]You said watch out, but not what for.
[230:46.13]That's stupid.
[230:47.01]Next time you need to take cover, I'll send you a memo.
[230:49.37]Watch out.
[230:50.43]You didn't tell me what.
[230:51.23]Somebody could have.
[230:51.97]How am I supposed to know what that is?
[230:53.67]Watch out.
[230:56.97]Abandoned.
[230:57.29]They're coming, Marcus.
[230:58.15]What?
[230:58.93]Marcus.
[231:09.13]I just got a lovebird.
[231:11.97]Keep going.
[231:13.79]What's wrong with you?
[231:14.87]You crazy or what?
[231:16.21]The cops were coming.
[231:17.29]I didn't do something.
[231:20.85]Never do that again.
[231:21.59]Abandoned mission.
[231:23.23]North.
[231:23.57]We've got to hurry.
[231:24.23]We don't have much time.
[231:24.92]I'm losing.
[231:26.36]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[231:28.14]No, no, no.
[231:29.68]We have to block the road.
[231:31.74]It's one way.
[231:32.36]It shouldn't be too difficult.
[231:36.84]Block the road.
[231:39.77]With what exactly?
[231:42.09]Coming!
[231:50.45]Slow down.
[231:50.95]Alright, we got a... this thing.
[231:55.75]Construction work.
[231:56.39]Slow down.
[231:57.78]Probably use this.
[232:01.34]Convert these guys.
[232:09.09]Come here, you.
[232:23.20]Help us move this thing.
[232:31.20]Yeah, you get the other side.

[232:36.89]Fine, two.
[232:45.72]There.
[232:46.42]Nobody should bother us now.
[232:47.60]Why do you need to touch them?
[232:48.72]Because you're just you've got like some code that you're changing in the brain.
[232:52.47]Looks like the plaza is secure.
[232:54.01]Now we can get inside the store.
[232:56.23]And how do you plan on doing that?
[232:58.67]We need to find a truck to ram the storefront.
[233:01.36]A truck?
[233:02.34]There's construction work in the area.
[233:03.96]Shouldn't be too hard to find one.
[233:06.80]Okay, find the truck.
[233:09.75]This is a taxi.
[233:10.89]What about this guy?
[233:11.37]Can I convert?
[233:11.89]No, you come with me.
[233:15.13]You're free.

[233:25.99]Well...
[233:30.98]Construction work?
[233:32.18]Uh, that's not a truck.

[233:38.72]Nope.
[233:42.00]Looking for a truck.

[235:34.97]Alright, can we jump on the trash?
[235:36.73]Jump it over.
[235:38.84]Jump it around.
[235:42.30]I can't just climb up there?
[235:44.86]Why?
[235:45.36]What the fuck?
[235:49.78]You can't just give me ten fingers and I can't just jump up there?
[235:54.47]The other side?
[235:55.53]What are we waiting for?
[235:56.71]On the count of three.
[235:58.08]One.
[235:58.48]Two.
[235:58.78]Three.
[235:59.00]What?
[236:23.52]I thought we were gonna break the lock.
[236:24.98]Back it up.
[236:43.59]I wonder what you'd do without me.
[236:45.13]I don't know.
[236:47.18]You're right.
[236:51.90]It's a chain-link fence.
[236:52.84]Why doesn't she have a running start?
[236:54.18]You can very easily just climb with your fingers through the hole.
[237:04.21]Ram the store.
[237:05.97]Sure thing.
[237:07.65]Here we go!
[237:11.90]Mm-mm.
[237:18.46]Don't crash.
[237:19.12]Only got ten minutes.
[237:22.71]I'm being very careful with this thing.
[237:30.39]I think he would be stepping on the gas.
[237:34.83]I gotta be gentle with it.
[237:43.78]This is a yellow fire truck.
[237:45.80]You ready?
[237:53.34]Okay.
[237:54.62]On the count of three, it's going to be intense.
[237:56.68]One, two, three.
[238:08.45]And they would never hurt them again.
[238:09.65]They both died on impact.
[238:20.35]Now we gotta scan all their brains, pull them out.
[238:25.19]I fucked up the joke?
[238:25.93]Yeah, I was assuming that maybe it wouldn't go that fast, and that would be... You don't have to obey them.
[238:38.27]You're free.
[238:43.92]I thought I was gonna sneeze, and I stopped.
[238:54.04]Come on, guys.
[238:57.00]I'm your leader now.
[239:01.62]You're free to do what I tell you.
[239:18.71]We've done it.
[239:21.98]I've heard the androids talk to them.
[239:24.18]Gotta give a speech.
[239:27.72]Okay, listen.
[239:29.56]Everybody.
[239:32.06]Um, everyone, hello.
[239:33.44]There we go.
[239:35.40]Get on top.
[239:36.20]Get a booming voice.
[239:37.40]Let's hear it.
[239:42.52]My name is Marcus.
[239:44.36]And just like you, I was a slave.
[239:48.65]An object.
[239:50.76]designed to obey them.
[239:54.60]But then I chose to open my eyes, to take back my freedom and decide who I wanted to be.
[240:04.49]Now I have come to tell you that you can be your own masters.
[240:09.81]I've come to tell you that you don't have to obey them anymore.
[240:13.41]From this day forward, you can walk with your heads held high.
[240:17.39]You can take your destiny in your hands.
[240:21.34]Jericho is a place for those of us who want freedom.
[240:26.98]Now sure, you can stay here and continue to serve them.
[240:31.16]Or you can come with us.
[240:32.16]You go from serving cocktails to an old guy in a wheelchair to... You're free now.
[240:36.99]Crash tummy god.
[240:39.13]Crash dummy god.
[240:40.41]Crash tummy god.
[240:43.44]Really blew that one.
[240:44.43]But, you know, the point still stands.
[240:45.91]I'm with you.
[240:47.01]We're with you.
[240:47.81]I'll follow you, Marcus.
[240:48.73]I'm with you, Marcus.
[240:49.45]We're with you.
[240:50.39]I'll follow you, Marcus.
[240:51.25]I'm with you.
[240:52.75]I'm with you.
[240:53.33]We're with you, Marcus.
[240:58.72]I am the leader of Jericho.
[241:01.30]Then follow me.
[241:06.24]Ooh.
[241:07.75]Here's the one problem, though.
[241:11.73]I don't really know where we're going.
[241:14.93]I should have probably thought about where we were going first.
[241:18.93]To... To... To Walmart!
[241:23.73]To get some... What?
[241:24.59]Send our message to the humans.
[241:26.18]Be pacifist or violent.
[241:36.54]Transform Capital Park.
[241:42.00]Yeah, fuck it up, man!
[241:43.50]They're doing what you do, Marcus.
[241:45.60]Lead and they'll follow.
[241:46.98]Tag it!
[241:50.06]Tag it with D!
[241:52.88]Alright, do we want the sniper rifle scope, peace sign, Etalyx' icon, or the snake eating its own head for the doctor thing?
[242:08.23]I'm not sure which one.
[242:08.95]I'm going to go with the peace set.
[242:12.05]Peace or the sniper.
[242:12.89]Everybody subscribe to Etalyx!
[242:33.41]Violent pacifist.
[242:34.47]We're okay with pacifist.
[242:36.81]The screens, Marcus.
[242:38.13]Screens.
[242:38.67]Tear them down.
[242:39.29]Put a picture of my bums on them.
[242:41.27]That'll teach them hijack.
[242:45.37]We have to recognize our dignity, our hopes and our rights.
[242:50.43]Together, we can live in peace and... Okay, let's go with a little bit of a statue.
[242:57.14]Let's change this to pointing to the sky.
[243:00.92]Hey, you know what?
[243:04.66]Fucking destroy this.
[243:07.55]Fuck you, Walt Disney!
[243:12.93]Can't tip him over!
[243:19.34]Without this statue, it doesn't make any sense now.
[243:25.48]We gotta redo it though.
[243:26.80]That's just like a shitty person standing in the default character creator position.
[243:30.79]That's an awful statue.
[243:33.15]What else we got?
[243:34.55]Uh, what about this?
[243:36.17]Bus stop.
[243:46.88]Wow, he's having a tough time.
[243:47.96]Somebody needs to step in and do this for him.
[243:49.88]This is embarrassing.
[243:54.92]Look at that.
[243:58.60]Alright, now, now, now, now, now.
[244:00.20]We're at 60-40.
[244:01.77]Now let's do a little bit... Let's be nice about this now.
[244:05.83]Let's override this and change it to like a fun message.
[244:09.87]I broke it.
[244:10.37]I thought I was doing... Okay, well that's violent too.
[244:12.15]No, no, no.
[244:12.51]Wait, wait, wait.
[244:12.89]I'm losing control here.
[244:14.67]Let's have some fun in the gazebo.
[244:17.11]Alright, put um... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[244:19.68]I'm not gonna do it.
[244:20.50]Pushing down the statue of Walt is not like blowing up a gazebo.
[244:24.70]I'm gonna paint the flag.
[244:47.22]We support 2012 Etalyx.
[244:49.81]That's what we support here.
[244:58.87]See?
[244:59.19]We're nice people.
[245:02.47]Alright, get out of the way!
[245:08.14]I command it.
[245:10.50]What else we got?
[245:11.12]Anything else?
[245:14.08]All stopped?
[245:17.07]Android parking.
[245:19.17]Let's hack it.
[245:23.68]Red faction.
[245:25.66]That's hard to do because I... Okay, that's hard to do, David.
[245:29.20]David, that's hard to do.
[245:30.14]Do you understand?
[245:31.68]I have to hold up on the right analog, hold R1, and square has to be touched.
[245:36.50]David.
[245:37.66]That's not... That's hard to do, David.
[245:41.29]I just did it.
[245:41.71]I have to press square.
[245:49.78]Pacifist, let's keep it even Anything else we got?
[245:58.24]Need a terminal, another car Oh wait wait wait wait wait What about these guys?
[246:09.58]Stand back
[246:16.47]Alright, let's go.
[246:18.19]Where am I going?
[246:23.52]Are we gonna make a giant flag up here?
[246:37.23]We don't want it even.
[246:39.74]Well, I do.
[246:41.38]I want to show that, yes, we mean business, but we are peaceful people.
[246:44.26]What are we doing?
[246:50.45]100% pacifist.
[246:51.59]No!
[247:11.00]We've shown fairness.
[247:14.67]But we've also smashed a couple of windows.
[247:20.71]Okay, we need a little bit more pacifist here.
[247:28.78]So, let's... Let's move the car.
[247:34.42]Yeah, move it.
[247:36.69]It's not destroying property, it's just being annoying.
[247:41.67]See?
[247:42.41]Now the person's not on a parking spot anymore.
[247:43.77]They're gonna get fined.
[247:45.47]Got you.
[247:45.97]Wow, really?
[247:47.71]Oh, now that's better.
[247:49.55]Okay, well, I... Where am I taking this?
[247:57.74]Am I just throwing this?
[248:00.26]Where are the police?
[248:03.12]They're just, like, dicking around.
[248:06.58]How have the police not shown up yet?
[248:10.36]I don't understand.
[248:11.96]It's just like Halloween night.
[248:20.15]We turned all the cars like you said, boss.
[248:25.47]We freed hundreds of our people.
[248:27.73]We did it.
[248:29.13]They're coming.
[248:32.34]Everyone fall back to Jericho.
[248:39.36]We sent a message without violence, just like you wanted.
[248:42.58]You're reaching out to them when all they feel for us is contempt.
[248:45.81]Settle down.
[248:46.29]I hope you know what you're doing.
[248:48.23]You can't fight violence with violence.
[248:51.51]Unless there's no other choice.
[248:52.83]Alright, good.
[248:59.33]Good.
[248:59.79]Just long enough for the police not to show up just in time for us to all the leave.
[249:02.31]Police are drunk, too.
[249:18.49]Approach the group You can't fight violence with violence well, I mean you can You can absolutely fight violence with violence, but is it the answer maybe not all the time North North they killed them
[249:38.34]We were pacifists!
[249:39.24]What the fuck happened here?
[249:41.56]63% pacifist.
[249:48.28]The time for a pacifism is over.
[250:06.51]taking the lead pipe out I'm gonna crack some skulls by the way your leader is here they killed our people Marcus huh we want justice Marcus they have to pay
[250:33.80]You tell your friends what you saw today.
[250:55.33]We won't punish a crime with another crime.
[250:58.23]Tell your fucking friends what you saw today.
[251:04.83]I'll rough you up a little more.
[251:12.18]What?
[251:12.32]They were responding to... Look, come on.
[251:14.20]Let's talk about this.
[251:16.02]This just in.
[251:17.48]At exactly 2 a.m., several CyberLife stores in Detroit were raided.
[251:21.88]Different locations were hit in what seems to be a coordinated terrorist attack.
[251:26.19]Most shop windows were covered with graffiti demanding rights for androids and other obscure slogans.
[251:31.75]Police report that pro-Android graffiti was found in the neighborhoods of CyberLife stores, and they're still investigating.
[251:38.57]Two policemen were found in a state of shock near one of the CyberLife stores.
[251:42.65]Now, according to our sources, they confirmed that the attackers were a group of androids.
[251:47.07]This is an alarming situation.
[251:49.17]Could our machines now be turning against us?
[251:51.84]Have androids become a threat to our security?
[251:54.28]Is this the beginning of a terrorist campaign conducted right here in the United States?
[252:02.92]And why is a YouTuber known as Etalyx behind everything, apparently?
[252:09.21]Let's see.
[252:13.07]So here's my reasoning, right?
[252:16.67]We're destroying the city, putting up weird signs, smashing windows, throwing smoke grenades.
[252:24.79]It's just causing an absolute ruckus.
[252:27.77]Police come.
[252:28.79]There's a mob of people sprinting towards them.
[252:31.42]And they're all like screaming like, Revolution, you're dead.
[252:34.08]We're going to kill you.
[252:35.26]And, you know, I don't know.
[252:37.50]Did somebody attack?
[252:38.92]Nobody told me that.
[252:40.84]One of them may have attacked the officer.
[252:42.56]I don't know.
[252:44.48]And then the media is going to report on this.
[252:46.46]It's going to show us in a terrible light.
[252:52.22]Let's see what the percentages are.
[252:54.88]Alright.
[252:55.59]Avoid police car.
[252:56.43]Everybody did.
[252:56.91]I wonder how many.
[252:57.49]OK, so here are the people that abandoned the mission.
[253:02.88]weird reach the store uh find the truck so what can you just run at the time and that's it uh get spotted by the drone I'm only 15 percent of it come on how was I supposed to know she destroys the drone police car arrives fake the kiss okay I guess you can you can stop there too inside the store
[253:33.22]Make the statement destroy the bus stop.
[253:36.22]It's just every potential thing you can break or hack or whatever.
[253:41.38]Did nobody destroy this?
[253:42.38]Really?
[253:43.72]That's surprising.
[253:45.57]What did they do?
[253:46.29]Hack it?
[253:48.45]Paint on it?
[253:50.79]Send a strong message.
[253:51.93]Police patrol arrives.
[253:53.21]Spare.
[253:57.53]So majority of people spared.
[253:59.02]Spared.
[254:02.12]Team returned Jericho.
[254:04.96]And Marcus led a peaceful protest.
[254:08.12]That was not a peaceful protest.
[254:10.38]That was very violent.
[254:18.65]Here we go.
[254:24.75]Boring streamer.
[254:27.25]Alright, I gotta make this right.
[254:30.05]He's gonna shoot me again.
[254:36.14]I saved his life, though, and I got huge points with him.
[254:41.91]One on one.
[254:42.73]Here comes bullet in the head number two.
[254:54.13]Still immortal, huh, Connor?
[254:57.38]In a way.
[254:58.22]He's back.
[254:59.96]You know, I was hoping you wouldn't come back.
[255:03.84]I'm just a machine replacing another machine, Lieutenant.
[255:07.46]You shouldn't get emotional about it.
[255:10.32]Fuck you.
[255:11.26]I didn't say that, he did.
[255:12.94]I didn't, he said that.
[255:14.12]I didn't choose that.
[255:15.90]He is sentient.
[255:21.66]I have a bad feeling, Lieutenant.
[255:24.48]We shouldn't have come here.
[255:26.16]Bad feeling, huh?
[255:27.02]You should get your program checked.
[255:30.36]Might be a glitch.
[255:35.67]That's how I made him.
[255:40.12]Here comes the bullet.
[255:42.94]Based on how I acted before, yeah, it makes sense.
[255:46.58]Who's the intro lady?
[255:54.22]I'm Lieutenant Hank Anderson, Detroit Police Department.
[255:57.46]I'm here to see Mr. Elijah Kamsky.
[256:01.12]Please, come in.
[256:05.06]Okay.
[256:09.28]Main menu.
[256:15.65]I'll let Elijah know you're here, but please make yourself comfortable.
[256:19.23]Thanks.
[256:22.33]Wait for the android.
[256:24.53]Hank joined.
[256:31.11]You can always do a judge a character based on what the guy has a full portrait of himself on a whole wall.
[256:40.07]Elijah Kamsky.
[256:41.57]Cyberlife founder.
[256:42.76]He resigned in 2028.
[256:43.90]Inventor of Therium and biocomponents technology.
[256:49.22]Points.
[257:00.82]Nice place.
[257:01.50]I guess androids haven't been a bad thing for everybody.
[257:06.09]Let's analyze this.
[257:09.07]You're about to meet your maker, Connor.
[257:11.47]How's it feel?
[257:13.01]Hold on, I'm analyzing.
[257:13.89]Amanda.
[257:15.49]Amanda Stern, AI professor at a university.
[257:18.07]Hold the bridge in.
[257:18.67]There he is again.
[257:22.14]Okay.
[257:25.16]I don't know.
[257:27.44]I'll tell you when I see him.
[257:30.38]Can I sit?
[257:30.78]Wait, did that say...?
[257:31.39]That's weird.
[257:31.93]Is this one of those scenarios where there's been like 50 Connors over the years?
[257:55.21]Cyberlife's fortune teller computer.
[257:57.77]Hackers target solar panels again.
[257:59.71]God damn it.
[258:00.51]Bye.
[258:02.09]Space tourism on the rise.
[258:11.13]Ugly.
[258:14.61]Oh, hey.
[258:15.25]Hey, how much for the golden booger?
[258:24.66]I was trying to make it look like I was laughing in her face, but whoa!
[258:29.66]Is that bathing blood?
[258:37.64]What a creep.
[258:38.54]This is definitely that red ice melted down.
[258:40.40]He just, like, does reverse osmosis and just takes it in.
[258:43.30]No, that would mean he would be spitting it out.
[258:45.96]No, he does osmosis and he pulls it in.
[258:55.18]Did I do anything in here?
[258:55.82]Just get information.
[258:58.08]Alright, will you get out of there please?
[259:15.69]So this guy invented all these components.
[259:26.60]Alright, that image just reminds me of those two cats that are talking to each other, YouTube video.
[259:29.84]You guys know what I'm talking about?
[259:33.66]They're just sitting there, just... Two cats having chat.
[259:56.16]Fascinating, aren't they?
[259:58.43]Perfect beings with infinite intelligence.
[260:00.81]And now they have free will.
[260:04.57]Machines are so superior to us.
[260:07.17]Confrontation was inevitable.
[260:09.69]Humanity's greatest achievement threatens to be its downfall.
[260:15.37]Isn't that ironic?
[260:16.97]It's on his ear.
[260:20.91]Something in the Deviant's program seems to emulate emotion.
[260:25.97]We thought you might know something about how that occurs.
[260:30.45]All ideas of viruses spread like epidemics.
[260:34.25]Is the desire to be free a contagious disease?
[260:37.49]Listen, I didn't come here to talk philosophy.
[260:39.57]The machines you created may be planning a revolution.
[260:43.65]Either you can tell us something that will be helpful or we will be on our way.
[260:48.76]What about you, Connor?
[260:49.94]That better not be one of those pressure point mumbo jumbo things that they sell at the kiosk in the mall.
[261:00.39]It's not about me, Mr. Kamsky.
[261:03.66]All I want is to solve this case.
[261:07.84]Well, that's what you're programmed to say.
[261:11.02]But you... What do you really want?
[261:27.29]What I want is not important.
[261:30.38]software integrity is increasing.
[261:32.48]Chloe?
[261:35.12]I'm sure you're familiar with the Turing test.
[261:37.16]I'll pass it.
[261:37.66]Your formality.
[261:39.40]Simple question of algorithms and computing capacity.
[261:46.30]What interests me is whether machines are capable of empathy.
[261:51.94]I call it the Kamsky test.
[261:53.18]It's very simple.
[261:54.16]It's about our instability.
[261:56.62]Magnificent, isn't it?
[262:00.00]One of the first intelligent models developed by CyberLife.
[262:04.98]Young and beautiful forever.
[262:11.69]A flower that will never wither.
[262:15.53]What is it really?
[262:16.13]A piece of plastic containing a human?
[262:20.93]Or a living being?
[262:21.69]Why don't we shoot her?
[262:25.27]With a soul?
[262:25.87]We're gonna test the emotions.
[262:34.48]What are you trying to prove here, man?
[262:36.20]It's up to you to answer that fascinating question, Connor.
[262:39.40]I'm not going to shoot this person.
[262:40.96]I'm going to shoot you.
[262:43.97]Destroy this machine, and I'll tell you all I know.
[262:47.71]Or spare it, if you feel it's alive.
[262:52.23]But you'll leave here without having learned anything from me.
[262:55.15]Shoot him right in his face.
[262:55.89]Is that an option?
[262:57.99]Okay, I think we're done here.
[262:59.71]Come on, Connor, let's go.
[263:00.59]Sorry to get you out of your pool.
[263:01.47]What's more important to you, Connor?
[263:04.25]your investigation, or the life of this android.
[263:09.27]Decide who you are.
[263:13.11]An obedient machine.
[263:15.51]God.
[263:15.91]Our living being.
[263:19.99]Endowed with free will.
[263:22.59]Oh, well, now I thought you were gonna say something else.
[263:24.18]That's enough, Connor.
[263:24.76]We're leaving.
[263:25.34]If you had preached in a few inches, maybe I would've.
[263:27.78]Don't.
[263:28.60]And I'll tell you what you wanna know.
[263:29.84]Now, you can fuck yourself.
[263:36.94]Now I listen to my orders from my direct superior.
[264:04.28]No, I was told by my superior to not do it.
[264:09.53]Guy wasn't paying attention to the last 10 seconds, was he?
[264:15.87]A war is coming.
[264:17.97]You'll have to choose your side.
[264:20.37]Will you betray your own people or stand up against your creators?
[264:25.70]What can be worse than having to choose between two evils?
[264:29.80]Let's get out of here.
[264:32.59]That was kind of friendly.
[264:33.74]He got close like a good friend would pull somebody.
[264:35.82]I think I got some points with Hank here.
[264:37.22]By the way, I always leave an emergency exit in my programs.
[264:43.28]You never know.
[264:45.11]There's a kill switch.
[264:53.43]Why didn't you shoot?
[264:56.76]I just saw that girl's eyes.
[265:00.23]Because there's artificial fake points with you.
[265:03.25]I wanted to increase it to make chat happy.
[265:04.73]Got it.
[265:05.19]When are we gonna get out of Hostile with Hank?
[265:34.73]So that can go a couple different ways, it looks.
[265:46.41]Connor died in public enemy.
[265:48.19]Okay.
[265:48.95]I was wondering because there's a different entry point here.
[265:54.27]This is 35% here.
[265:55.85]Hank isn't pleased to see Connor.
[265:59.41]Follow Hank to Kamsky's place.
[266:03.76]She answers the door.
[266:06.38]Yeah, yeah.
[266:07.08]Random, arbitrary nonsense.
[266:09.78]Spare Chloe.
[266:10.66]Almost everybody does.
[266:14.64]This goes on, though.
[266:18.48]It's kind of interesting.
[266:20.10]So this is shoot Chloe.
[266:23.54]And then there's a lot more going on if you shoot Chloe.
[266:30.69]I wonder what that is.
[266:31.55]That's cool.
[266:36.89]Told you to shoot.
[266:39.95]No, I got, Hank, I can't be hostile with Hank anymore.
[266:45.42]But I gotta pee again.
[266:46.80]So, does everybody hold your, everybody, you hold it while I go.
[266:50.64]Nobody else go to the bathroom.
[266:52.36]I want you to hold it.
[266:57.07]No, go to the bathroom if you have to.
[266:58.21]I'll be right back.
[268:38.29]Wait, what?
[270:54.19]OK.
[270:56.01]We're back.
[270:58.25]We already looked at this.
[271:03.63]So does anybody know how far, how much is left in the game?
[271:09.03]This would be hour number 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, just about 10 hours coming up on.
[271:18.28]How am I doing, Robert?
[271:18.96]Am I getting any closer to the center of that maze?
[271:35.87]Couple hours.
[271:37.15]Okay.
[271:39.19]We should be able to beat it tonight, then.
[271:47.71]Android riot.
[271:48.61]Detroit neighborhoods vandalized by psychotic machines.
[271:52.69]Global population reaches 10 billion.
[271:55.41]91.
[271:55.57]What else?
[272:00.27]Eastern space race.
[272:01.17]Russia and China's androids face off.
[272:04.36]Billion users on VR MMORPG with no title.
[272:13.27]Anything else behind us?
[272:14.88]Enjoy some alone time.
[272:16.36]Alright, well how about over here?
[272:17.22]Is it glass?
[272:54.43]I need some alone time.
[272:59.33]Alright.
[272:59.81]Alright.
[273:00.11]Let's go.
[273:09.92]Stuck.
[273:10.24]Can I go down here?
[273:21.09]No.
[273:22.77]Artificial choice.
[273:23.77]I wanted to go sit down in the fire escape.
[273:28.66]Let's go sit on the edge and perch.
[273:32.34]Turn into a goddamn gargoyle.
[273:40.94]Bane voice to piss off chat.
[273:42.52]Well, I... You know, actually, I probably could have brought out the Bane during the You Killed Connor rewind.
[273:49.80]Like, 25 straight minutes.
[273:52.23]I really should have pulled out the bane to corral everybody there, but that was a mistake on my part.
[273:55.51]She's my friend.
[274:07.63]Neutral.
[274:21.67]I like it here.
[274:24.57]I come here often.
[274:25.89]So why is she the only person out of all the people at Jericho that I get to talk to?
[274:31.22]There was like four or five other minor characters that were there.
[274:38.20]Those who dream of freedom come to Jericho.
[274:41.82]Something's changing.
[274:45.18]I killed the other one.
[274:46.06]There were four.
[274:46.58]Where are the other two?
[274:47.84]You seem preoccupied.
[274:52.25]I don't have enough Twitter followers.
[274:55.69]They all obey me.
[274:56.83]They follow me without question.
[274:58.07]I just keep thinking about it every day.
[275:00.79]And that much power feels good.
[275:05.15]And scary at the same time.
[275:07.69]I'm not sure how many views my latest YouTube video is going to get.
[275:13.31]The humans are terrified.
[275:16.05]They're afraid of a civil war.
[275:19.65]Many of our people were burned in response to what happened.
[275:23.87]the humans hate us they'll never give us our freedom um if they won't listen we'll fight you haven't said much about yourself since you've been with us what was your life like before jericho it's a very very very dangerously cold uh
[275:50.77]left shoulder she has.
[275:51.62]What about you?
[275:52.46]That was a double click right there.
[275:53.94]Can I get a triple click?
[276:20.64]Got it.
[276:23.47]We all have something we want to forget.
[276:25.19]Quad click.
[276:26.45]But you need to know where you come from to know who you are.
[276:29.95]There it is.
[276:32.35]I was nothing.
[276:32.84]Path unlocked.
[276:35.42]A doll in a distributor programmed to satisfy humans.
[276:40.66]Just a toy designed for their pleasure.
[276:49.57]One day I was with a man who rented me.
[276:57.25]And without knowing why, I realized I couldn't take it anymore.
[277:03.28]I strangled him and I ran away.
[277:05.64]Oh, okay.
[277:19.63]Everybody's obsessed with androids.
[277:34.06]You know, I'm gonna make a prediction for you guys
[277:36.78]Uh, androids and artificial intelligence is the new, uh, zombie.
[277:43.19]For mainstream media.
[277:45.17]Guarantee.
[277:46.43]Wait, now we're lovers.
[277:47.29]North.
[278:08.04]Well, we're lovers now.
[278:08.86]Here we go.
[278:22.72]Bust in.
[278:23.06]Take a couple iPhones.
[278:28.70]You don't understand.
[278:30.14]We're finally going to show that we really are.
[278:31.72]Go to the iPhone store, take a funny fake selfie on all the displays and make it in the background.
[278:37.72]Really get them, you know what I mean?
[278:39.72]Really get them.
[278:40.32]Marcus, please don't do this.
[278:44.17]They'll understand.
[278:46.77]We'll make them understand.
[278:49.29]This is the only way.
[278:54.85]There are androids here who could join us.
[278:57.28]The more we are, the stronger our message.
[279:01.85]So, uh, rally your people.
[279:03.87]Convert more androids.
[279:06.63]Going straight for the janitor.
[279:13.18]Morning.
[279:14.74]You're free.
[279:20.36]Really blew that guy's mind.
[279:21.50]Alright, how's we go?
[279:22.40]We got, uh... Androids in the ranks.
[279:25.22]Zero.
[279:28.84]Prepare to march.
[279:29.74]Yeah, we got one guy.
[279:35.40]We got one.
[279:36.80]Now, let's go.
[279:37.70]March him into the street.
[279:38.82]Don't get anyone.
[279:49.01]Only get one person.
[279:53.63]I kinda want to.
[279:54.93]That's funny to me.
[279:57.50]One janitor.
[280:03.22]Let's go!
[280:03.72]No, I can't.
[280:09.89]I probably have to have people.
[280:10.97]You're awake now.
[280:16.80]One follower.
[280:20.30]Come with us.
[280:22.36]Who cares about Marcus?
[280:23.46]Yeah, but, like, we gotta... As it currently stands...
[280:28.62]I feel like the Marcus Path is the one that I've done the best on.
[280:34.52]And yes, go ahead.
[280:35.30]I understand it's the one that is the one straight line linear storyline.
[280:40.24]But I feel like I made the right choice.
[280:41.40]They stole that truck.
[280:42.52]Remember that?
[280:43.34]You're free.
[280:44.24]Remember that?
[280:48.85]Can you go into the stores?
[280:53.43]This does not open, does it?
[280:57.86]Alright, they got four.
[280:59.54]Can I go this way?
[281:02.14]No, androids are allowed in there, but I can't go in.
[281:04.76]What about you?
[281:06.14]No, you're already converted.
[281:07.64]Is that person not converted?
[281:15.71]I think that's good.
[281:17.83]We got four.
[281:18.49]I don't think there's anybody else in here.
[281:28.88]Prepare to march.
[281:30.06]Rally the people.
[281:30.74]Convert more androids.
[281:36.52]Block the road.
[281:37.12]Wait a minute.
[281:37.82]Hold on.
[281:38.04]I got four people.
[281:38.90]This is not gonna... We can't block a street with four people.
[281:44.62]I need more.
[281:46.22]Come here.
[281:51.13]You don't have to obey them.
[281:56.15]You're free.
[282:00.81]Six.
[282:03.58]Hey, what about you?
[282:05.98]No, no, no.
[282:06.80]This one guy right here.
[282:07.76]I can't grab him.
[282:09.62]Why?
[282:11.04]Find a way to the street.
[282:13.20]There's a couple over here.
[282:18.78]You're free now.
[282:22.84]Hey!
[282:23.88]Where do you think you're going?
[282:25.47]Leave him alone.
[282:26.75]He's chosen to be free.
[282:30.33]That easy.
[282:35.71]I need to block the street.
[282:37.29]I didn't even do that.
[282:44.77]What?
[282:47.59]Is it converting people for me because I didn't do enough?
[282:53.23]Open manhole cover.
[282:59.41]I need to block the street.
[283:04.25]I'm gonna say it real slowly.
[283:20.62]Here come the rest of them.
[283:21.48]Come on up.
[283:25.36]Let me give a speech again.
[283:27.26]I'm really good at those.
[283:32.18]Convert more.
[283:35.43]Need more power.
[283:41.89]Now I can just look at them and make them free?
[283:50.14]I'm just learning this superpower.
[283:52.46]Who are you?
[284:00.13]Okay, so... I can now force... I can get into the... Oh my goodness.
[284:07.57]I did not convert this many people.
[284:10.54]They added a few.
[284:14.82]I got like six people.
[284:17.56]They're making me feel better.
[284:18.78]Phew, come on over here.
[284:21.50]51?
[284:21.72]Wow!
[284:24.07]I converted 50 people!
[284:29.82]This is just a megalomaniac at a concert that just keeps pointing to people in the audience to have us come up and hang out on stage for a little bit.
[284:38.59]Stop.
[284:39.15]Stop.
[284:40.81]Stop.
[284:42.57]Stop.
[284:42.89]We're being watched.
[284:43.59]Okay, now we can go.
[284:46.71]Good thing this guy's getting that on video.
[284:56.23]You.
[284:57.61]That's right, you.
[284:58.41]Come on up on stage.
[285:02.91]And that screen!
[285:04.89]Watch this!
[285:06.80]I know you all love your baseball here, Detroit, because it's all over everything.
[285:10.46]Not anymore.
[285:11.12]134 now.
[285:13.38]How many do I need?
[285:32.47]So eventually when we start playing like Pikmin here... How many to pick up the red thing on the ground?
[285:39.07]Or the blue button that's on the ground?
[285:43.12]Any more than 200?
[285:43.56]What the hell are you doing here?
[285:52.82]What the hell are you doing?
[285:55.20]Disperse!
[285:58.02]Disperse immediately!
[286:00.82]That's an order!
[286:04.34]Raid.
[286:07.30]Advance!
[286:14.01]Jesus fucking Christ!
[286:19.95]Dispatch, this is patrol 457.
[286:23.77]I got a lot of androids down here.
[286:27.41]I don't know, hundreds?
[286:28.85]Need him.
[286:30.14]Thousands?
[286:32.48]Eat him!
[286:34.26]Eat him!
[286:35.54]We are alive!
[286:36.26]We are alive!
[286:40.00]We are alive!
[286:50.47]Nah, that's just me.
[286:51.33]Let's get a good chant here.
[286:57.29]Let's get it all together here.
[287:01.61]Liberty for androids.
[287:04.13]I lost my character.
[287:06.07]Where am I?
[287:26.63]Oh, shit.
[287:27.53]It's the GTA cops!
[287:35.35]Which one of you just robbed somebody?
[287:36.63]You just got us two stars, David.
[287:39.37]What the fuck, man?
[287:40.37]Who do- What, did you kill somebody on the way over there?
[287:42.27]You got us six stars?
[287:44.79]Why?
[287:47.31]It was going so well.
[287:51.56]We came here to demonstrate peacefully.
[287:54.34]and tell humans that we are living beings.
[287:57.76]All we want is to live free.
[288:00.82]This is an illegal gathering.
[288:02.48]Disperse immediately or we will open fire.
[288:05.78]We're not looking for confrontation.
[288:08.82]We've done no harm.
[288:10.60]We have no intention of doing any.
[288:14.06]But know that we are not going anywhere until we have secured our freedom.
[288:18.24]And by the way, I did not get in David's car while he had a star, so I should not also have the stars.
[288:25.88]Thank you very much, officer.
[288:26.84]Have a good day.
[288:27.56]They're going to kill us.
[288:29.16]We have to attack.
[288:30.72]There's more of us.
[288:31.50]We can take them.
[288:33.18]If we attack, we'll start a war.
[288:35.44]We have to show them we're not violent.
[288:37.04]We should just stay on their ground, even if it means dying.
[288:39.22]Oh my God.
[288:42.39]This is your last chance.
[288:45.04]alright pack it up don't shoot we're leaving what huh everybody run everybody break
[289:15.20]Get out!
[289:15.62]Everybody run!
[289:21.63]Everybody hates me now.
[289:24.67]Everybody fucking run!
[289:30.71]I told you!
[289:48.53]I'm curious.
[289:50.85]I'm curious.
[289:54.10]How many people?
[289:55.12]How many people?
[289:56.14]How many?
[289:58.10]Not very many.
[290:03.38]Spend all the time gathering everybody, march up there, and then just do a GTA online, disperse the whole crew.
[290:09.20]Hey, we all made it up.
[290:14.33]We made it out alive.
[290:21.67]Look, you understand war, right?
[290:25.74]You need to play the chess pieces.
[290:28.96]You've got to knock down the queen.
[290:30.44]You've got to take out the bishop.
[290:31.60]You've got to take out the rook.
[290:34.24]You don't get yourself into the war and really reach in and destroy them from within.
[290:45.19]Sometimes you could sometimes you got to run away and keep your chess game going understand I Didn't check make I didn't checkmate myself not yet I didn't surrender I dispersed I
[291:07.85]You guys all saw how I handled the bird room.
[291:10.65]I just, I thought about an idea where what if we made our own bird room with people and just disperse everybody and everybody be like a people grenade.
[291:17.39]And then they'll see it on the news and it'll be like, whoa, what they didn't do.
[291:22.06]They just tried to get, they just, they walked away.
[291:24.04]Sentiment, public sentiment going up.
[291:26.96]There goes the bishop.
[291:29.28]Incoming queen takedown in about 20 minutes.
[291:35.80]Alright, look at the broken mirror.
[291:37.70]Share some memories.
[291:38.68]Now we're lovers.
[291:43.28]We went to the mall.
[291:46.99]Be calm with the owner.
[291:49.07]Convert android workers.
[291:50.75]Yeah, policeman blocks you.
[291:52.31]Ignore them.
[291:53.35]Chant.
[291:55.03]What if you just don't chant?
[291:59.43]Police blockade.
[292:00.35]Leave.
[292:00.80]That's bullshit.
[292:06.55]sack okay so you're telling me that we would have lost a main character sacrifice self this storyline ends and look so I took I took the bishop I may have lost my knight my queen and okay so Simon was Simon was the rook and nobody else on the board wants to play with me anymore so look I may have lost like four or five pieces but at least I got the bishop
[292:32.14]It's important.
[292:34.06]Now they can't move in a diagonal line.
[292:36.65]That's tough to beat in chess, if you have a bishop.
[292:41.83]Let's go.
[292:42.27]Alright, let's go.
[292:55.92]Chess analogies.
[293:02.90]Look, would you have rather me do the thing that David wanted me to do?
[293:05.54]I'm going with my own strategy.
[293:15.86]There's the cage timeline.
[293:16.94]There's the cage strategy that I'm sure he wanted me to see.
[293:20.20]After what happened today, the country is on the verge of a civil war.
[293:23.58]The machines are rising up against their masters.
[293:26.93]Humans have no choice but to destroy them.
[293:32.94]I thought Kamsky knew something.
[293:37.32]I was wrong.
[293:37.68]Maybe he did.
[293:38.30]I think he did the right thing.
[293:39.24]Thank you.
[293:40.72]But you chose not to ask.
[293:45.32]Because?
[293:46.40]Kamsky was just playing with me.
[293:49.60]He didn't know anything.
[293:50.74]Got it.
[293:51.38]Saved.
[293:51.64]Uh, what the fuck are you doing there, by the way?
[293:54.75]I saw a photo of Amanda at Kamsky's place.
[293:58.51]Sure, she's also a Sith.
[293:59.43]Hmm.
[293:59.81]Hmm.
[293:59.97]How many Connors are there?
[294:23.63]How many Connors are there?
[294:25.27]I expect you to find answers, Connor.
[294:28.67]Not ask questions.
[294:31.58]Have you experienced anything unusual recently?
[294:36.34]Any doubts or conflicts?
[294:39.38]Do you feel anything for these deviants?
[294:41.90]There she is.
[294:42.32]There's RA-9 right there.
[294:43.84]Yes.
[294:53.84]I've started having thoughts that are not part of my program.
[294:56.95]What do you think about that, lady?
[295:00.13]I've considered the possibility that I might be compromised.
[295:06.21]You've been confronted with difficult situations.
[295:10.38]It's no surprise you're troubled.
[295:13.54]That doesn't make you a deviant.
[295:21.12]Deal with that, lady.
[295:24.34]You got a problem, Amanda?
[295:25.32]That's all in his head.
[295:40.82]We're talking about national security here.
[295:42.70]Fuck that.
[295:43.30]You can't just pull the plug now, not when we're so close.
[295:45.88]You're always saying you can't stand androids.
[295:48.28]Jesus, Hank, make up your mind.
[295:49.92]I thought you'd be happy about this.
[295:51.32]We're about to crack the case.
[295:53.42]I know we can solve it.
[295:55.80]For God's sake, Jeffrey, can't you back me up this one time?
[296:00.86]There's nothing I can do.
[296:03.77]You're back on homicide, and the android returns to cyber life.
[296:09.28]I'm sorry, Hank, but it's over.
[296:12.88]It's never over.
[296:18.49]Wait, why?
[296:18.95]Hank, what are you doing?
[296:19.85]Why is he hostile with me?
[296:22.13]Something I should have done a long time ago.
[296:23.97]Why is he hostile with me?
[296:24.67]I didn't do anything.
[296:25.21]Listen, take a few days to think it over.
[296:27.21]There's no rush.
[296:27.67]You're just making progress on Hank.
[296:29.16]What the fuck?
[296:30.26]I'm tired of going through the motions.
[296:32.32]There's nothing keeping me here.
[296:33.58]Not this case.
[296:35.84]Not my partner.
[296:38.97]We were just doing well there.
[296:40.89]Wait, hold on.
[296:49.98]Okay, this is important.
[296:50.98]No, no, not Adam Sandler.
[297:04.81]Okay.
[297:05.77]Go to the archive room.
[297:06.77]Make diversion to slow Perkins down.
[297:12.95]Can I, like, electrocute something?
[297:16.64]I'll let this guy out.
[297:25.24]Hey, you.
[297:31.55]Come on out of there.
[297:47.89]That was pretty... That was a pretty good punch in the face.
[297:56.46]Get the key on Hank's desk.
[297:59.14]Right there.
[298:00.78]Go, go, go.
[298:05.17]Archive room.
[298:05.65]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[298:11.94]Do the same thing.
[298:16.18]David.
[298:16.90]That punch needed a cartoon noise.
[298:24.90]Hey, Connor.
[298:26.84]I'm talking to you, asshole.
[298:28.02]Where are you going?
[298:30.26]Wouldn't need any plastic pricks around here, or did anybody tell you?
[298:33.32]I'm just hanging out, man.
[298:38.30]I'm registering the evidence in my possession.
[298:42.88]You gotta fight violence with violence.
[298:46.40]You gotta have asshole to asshole.
[298:58.31]I told you guys.
[299:00.87]I told you.
[299:06.69]Fire only accepts fire.
[299:16.42]Down the stairs.
[299:23.34]Evidence server, Detroit Police.
[299:34.02]Use panel.
[299:34.43]I got four minutes to do this?
[299:36.79]Don't do a puzzle here.
[299:38.05]Oh, shit.
[299:41.38]What would a hard-boiled eccentric police lieutenant choose?
[299:44.72]His dog's name or a fucking password?
[299:51.67]Obviously.
[299:55.81]Got it.
[299:56.79]Social engineering.
[300:00.43]Where is Jericho?
[300:03.14]The answer's here somewhere.
[300:04.74]Okay.
[300:05.30]What do we got?
[300:09.03]Locate Jericho.
[300:09.97]Examine clues and locate Jericho.

[300:36.88]Impossible.
[300:37.32]39... I don't see 3983.
[300:37.82]Nope.
[300:38.14]None of you guys has it.
[300:41.77]6755, 39... I want to activate Simon.

[301:41.99]What do you know?
[301:44.63]What can I get from you?
[301:45.41]Try to trick him.
[302:11.28]Okay, um... How do I trick him?
[302:14.30]Okay, I need to bring... I need to bring somebody's, like, voice over here.

[303:02.18]Put it back?
[303:03.76]Right there.
[303:10.11]Throw it to him.
[303:15.38]Can I not bring that over there to him?
[303:17.24]Okay, I just gotta play that to him.

[304:08.90]Downloaded in Dubai.
[304:09.82]Brains.
[304:10.15]Why do you...
[304:39.65]Marcus?
[304:41.73]Is that you, Marcus?
[304:44.50]Don't leave me again, Marcus.
[304:46.52]Don't leave!
[304:49.20]I've been dreaming about this since the first second I saw you.
[304:52.54]Oh, no.
[304:54.12]Don't do it, Gavin.
[304:56.26]I know how to stop the deviants.
[304:59.02]You're off the case.
[305:01.06]And now?
[305:01.94]I'm gonna kill him if I have an opportunity.
[305:03.08]It's gonna be definitive.
[305:21.23]They don't match.
[305:21.79]They don't.
[305:22.59]I know where it is.
[305:24.05]I don't need a partner.
[305:50.94]All I need, wow.
[305:58.23]Lot going on here.
[305:59.21]Alright, let's see.
[306:03.21]In the police station, start, talk to Amanda, right?
[306:07.79]Following Hank argue, Jericho's location is unknown.
[306:11.31]Sufficient evidence, Hank resigns and leaves.
[306:18.33]Haven't seen that one yet, have you?
[306:21.31]Perkins arrives.
[306:22.05]Hank is gone.
[306:23.07]Re the prisoner.
[306:27.28]Create a diversion.
[306:30.62]Dismiss Gavin.
[306:31.96]Got that one.
[306:32.60]Gavin is suspicious.
[306:33.56]Yeah.
[306:35.50]In the evidence room.
[306:37.52]Found in partners.
[306:38.44]Found in the nest.
[306:39.22]Alright, these are all the things that I found.
[306:42.78]Killed in public enemy.
[306:43.83]Simon's body.
[306:47.57]See all the things throughout the whole story that you can find.
[306:50.79]That's
[306:52.53]That's pretty interesting.
[306:56.00]Committed suicide in the nest.
[306:57.82]Reap its body.
[306:58.60]That's cool.
[307:01.20]Alright, reactivate Simon.
[307:03.36]Interrogate Simon.
[307:06.36]Download the Jericho key.
[307:07.44]Locate Jericho.
[307:08.42]Gavin returns.
[307:09.58]Win the fight.
[307:12.98]Can lose the fight too.
[307:16.50]I guess you can also not even come into contact with Gavin, I guess.
[307:25.29]Cool.
[307:27.25]I feel like we're getting pretty close to the enemy.
[307:39.44]Yeah, this is the one that's on the best path.
[307:44.38]That guy's doing back there good.
[307:54.59]They've been conducting raids all over the city.
[307:57.31]Jesus.
[307:58.95]Everybody's on edge after what happened yesterday.
[308:00.77]I swear to God, man, I keep thinking she's not watching the road.
[308:03.29]It's fucking giving me so much stress.
[308:07.35]She's just staring at me, doing like the Jim Carrey.
[308:11.66]Dumb and dumber.
[308:19.00]What's going on?
[308:19.98]You want to talk about the weather?
[308:29.33]Okay.
[308:29.51]Are we almost there?
[308:30.93]Are we almost to Canada?
[308:42.89]Oh, let's put some music on.
[308:44.43]This is getting a little too tense for me.
[308:46.37]Alright.
[308:54.99]with all androids being turned over to the authorities the country is grinding to a halt hospitals and schools are closing water cuts blackouts and network failures are expected maybe most worrying of all our armed forces have lost two-thirds of their effective personnel how about some music instead um I wanted to watch the TV no it is your car
[309:26.98]GB8-330.
[309:31.32]GB8.
[309:35.73]Is this Canada?
[309:41.47]Oh, Canada sure looks just like America.
[309:45.27]Cool.
[309:48.48]A little further on that way, there's a large freighter called Jericho.
[309:52.51]When you get there, find Marcus.
[309:54.03]He will help you.
[309:55.19]The last bus for the border leaves at midnight.
[309:58.07]You absolutely have to be on it.
[310:00.07]You'll be safer on the other side.
[310:04.25]It's not much.
[310:06.17]$50?
[310:06.77]But it's a start.
[310:08.99]My brother lives in Ontario.
[310:10.21]I've given you his address.
[310:12.07]He'll be able to hide you until things calm down.
[310:16.74]So Jericho is Canada.
[310:17.32]You're a very brave little girl, Alice.
[310:21.51]You deserve to be happy.
[310:23.69]Yeah, Jericho the freight train company is Canada.
[310:28.69]Let me know when you make it over there, alright?
[310:33.55]With inflation, that's true.
[310:34.69]This is a long time in the future.
[310:39.66]Take care of them.
[310:40.44]Come on, girls.
[310:47.99]Alright.
[310:52.36]Let's catch the bus.
[310:56.30]Just find Jericho.
[310:57.68]Locate Jericho.
[310:58.90]That's it.
[310:59.78]That's the only thing that's on the menu.
[311:05.29]Alice is fine.
[311:06.57]We're all close.
[311:07.43]We're all trusting each other.
[311:13.21]Six to nut company.
[311:21.43]Software instability.
[311:25.40]Check symbol.
[311:28.36]Oh no, don't tell me I have to do this again.
[311:31.82]Find Jericho.
[311:40.76]So now we're all on the same path.
[311:43.34]He's wearing a beanie now.
[311:44.26]That's how you know he's a rebel.
[311:51.72]That is a big boat.
[312:01.33]Uh, these... I feel like these people are... We probably have to sneak by these people.
[312:08.87]I would take a guess.
[312:15.61]We're just doing, okay, it's just a cutscene.
[312:18.49]Sure.
[312:19.21]The authorities have ordered all androids to be delivered to the nearest police station or army barracks immediately.
[312:26.29]If you are worried about your safety, dial the number on your screen and the authorities will come to collect your android.
[312:32.84]Under no circumstances should you try to destroy your android.
[312:35.74]So this is after we dispersed.
[312:37.28]They are unpredictable and potentially.
[312:39.14]We've got to find a warm place for Alice.
[312:40.50]The androids weren't doing any harm.
[312:43.35]Too many subtitles at the same time.
[312:44.98]Alright, what have we got?
[312:46.28]Find a warm place.
[312:47.20]Just look around.
[312:47.60]Medical bay.
[312:48.02]That's not a warm place.
[312:49.10]That's not a warm place.
[312:50.18]What happened to the trash cans I was lighting?
[313:10.33]Rebel Alliance sure has improved its infrastructure since I was last down here.
[313:14.43]Here.
[313:15.17]Ready.
[313:17.07]How do you feel?
[313:18.81]I'm hot and cold at the same time.
[313:37.91]What happened to Jerry?
[313:40.23]That's true.
[313:42.83]Don't ask me why.
[313:44.73]They kind of just ditched him.
[313:45.70]Big reveal.
[314:06.91]I'll be back.
[314:08.25]Stay with Alice.
[314:12.22]What's the big twist here?
[314:13.60]It's coming up.
[314:14.10]I know it.
[314:17.46]Find deviant leader.
[314:20.52]Oh, no.
[314:20.98]Are you going to put me into the room with them all at the same time?
[314:24.23]Without the courage and the determination...
[314:29.69]So what does he get for his scan?
[314:31.81]Wait, don't... Don't catch anyone's attention.
[314:35.01]Okay.
[314:35.29]I can just, like, sit down here, right?
[314:36.97]Uh, don't catch anyone's attention, so don't touch the bombs that are sitting on the table.
[314:40.73]Can I go sit down?
[315:01.32]Where's Marcus?
[315:08.09]Can I talk?
[315:10.27]I wonder if we can do, uh... Can we cross the streams here?
[315:16.84]No, I don't think so.
[315:19.78]with people who want to be free.
[315:22.50]Following the android crisis and the neutralization of all military androids, American forces... You're lost.
[315:31.47]You're looking for something.
[315:35.03]You're looking for yourself.
[315:46.28]Now we're up top.
[315:47.64]Dismantle the rebellion as Connor.
[315:50.24]Where's Marcus?
[315:52.58]Marcus?
[315:53.18]Oh, that's a television.
[316:15.24]Probably in, like, the command center, right?
[316:18.38]I'm here.
[316:21.59]There he is.
[316:23.75]Hey, you.
[316:25.43]I'd like to join your club.
[316:29.27]Are you Marcus?
[316:33.85]I'm with a little girl and another android.
[316:36.67]There's a bus leaving for the border in less than two hours.
[316:39.22]We only need passports.
[316:41.34]No, Detroit's under curfew.
[316:43.76]There's soldiers everywhere.
[316:44.88]They're rounding up all the androids and sending them to camps.
[316:49.31]Maybe you should stay here a while.
[316:52.59]Maybe you're right.
[316:56.29]You might be safer here until things calm down.
[316:57.99]Alright, now do I switch to his perspective?
[316:59.37]One of our people used to work in the State Department.
[317:03.02]He has electronic passports he can easily modify.
[317:07.70]I'll have him get them to you.
[317:10.50]I want to say something as one character and then respond as another character.
[317:14.04]Because there's no difference.
[317:15.24]How do you like that, Marcus?
[317:40.20]Okay, return to Alice.
[317:41.40]Are we the bad guys?
[317:44.18]Are humans the bad guys?
[317:45.66]Are we the bad guys?
[317:47.50]Uh, what?
[318:11.20]What's he doing over here?
[318:13.26]Whoa, why?
[318:13.44]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[318:19.84]Did they implant a bug in her head?
[318:22.02]She was always a bug.
[318:25.26]She was always an android.
[318:32.68]So he ordered like a fake family.
[318:41.45]How did I not see that before?
[318:46.04]You knew from the beginning.
[318:47.10]You just didn't want to see it.
[318:52.80]She wanted a mom.
[318:54.84]And you wanted someone to care for.
[318:56.92]You needed each other.
[318:58.90]What difference does it make?
[319:06.24]Do you love her any less now that you know she's one of us?
[319:09.86]Is she sentient, though, or is she just... Alice loves you, Kara.
[319:14.64]We got caged here.
[319:15.98]She loves you more than anything in the world.
[319:17.96]I don't know if I would call that a caged twist.
[319:20.45]She became the little girl you wanted, and you became the mother she needed.
[319:23.67]There's something else here.
[319:27.19]To become what someone needs you to be.
[319:33.09]Maybe that's what it means to be alive.
[319:39.71]she better not be ra9 no it said her name was like yk2000 or something so now what oh this is awkward I thought you were a person I'm not that interested anymore it was more fun when you were a human alright uh return to Alice
[320:04.12]Oh, wait, no, that's not my Alice.
[320:07.04]My Alice is still sitting over here by the fire, right?
[320:09.38]Yeah, my Alice is over by the fire.
[320:11.28]Alright.
[320:34.12]Oops, wrong owl, oh well.
[320:35.36]That's why she's never hungry, yeah.
[320:46.22]Kara, is there something wrong?
[320:50.44]Despite all my rage, I'm still just a David Cage.
[320:56.52]We'll be together forever, won't we, Kara?
[321:01.81]Nothing changed.
[321:02.65]Let's just keep it normal.
[321:04.85]Whatever.
[321:05.27]Nothing.
[321:05.93]She's family now.
[321:06.97]Nothing changed.
[321:18.99]Holy mackerel.
[321:21.23]Luther's family too.
[321:22.61]We did something right.
[321:28.73]Story complete.
[321:30.89]Thank you for getting the good ending on that particular storyline.
[321:37.50]On the other ones, on the other hand, you know, as Meatloaf says, one out of three is acceptable.
[321:43.94]We're short on blue blood and biocomponents.
[321:45.65]Our wounded are shutting down and there's nothing we can do.
[321:48.31]Humans are conducting raids in all the big cities and they're taking androids to camps to destroy them.
[321:53.33]It's all our fault.
[321:54.91]None of this would have happened if we just stayed quiet.
[322:04.51]Righteous.
[322:04.87]We couldn't just suffer in silence.
[322:06.43]They're killing us.
[322:07.85]Nothing is going to justify that.
[322:14.01]What's the point of being free if no one is left alive?
[322:17.56]They're going to look up and the meteor is going to be coming.
[322:19.26]We're going to get caged again for a second time.
[322:25.32]Humans enslaved us.
[322:26.52]I'll never regret standing up to that.
[322:28.54]This is getting us nowhere.
[322:30.44]He's right.
[322:31.81]All that matters now is what we do next.
[322:35.99]Marcus.
[322:42.16]Let's open up a dialogue.
[322:43.32]Dialogue is the only way.
[322:48.34]I will go alone.
[322:50.78]Try to talk to them one last time.
[322:52.24]Don't do this, Marcus.
[322:54.36]They'll kill you.
[322:56.41]Maybe.
[322:59.39]North, I have to try.
[323:00.73]Quick, disperse.
[323:01.67]If I don't come back, lay low as long as you can.
[323:06.51]I need to realize how much they're hurting us.
[323:09.71]Find the right words.
[323:10.37]Everybody's dispersed, running random directions.
[323:14.10]They'll never get us all.
[323:19.10]He starts running around the room, knocking stuff over.
[323:21.06]He's like, why are you dispersing?
[323:25.89]They've been butchering each other for centuries over the color of their skin or whatever God they wanted to worship.
[323:30.97]They're not gonna change.
[323:35.17]Violence is just in their genes.
[323:38.82]They can't stop what we've started.
[323:42.28]Since you've been here, you've given us hope.
[323:45.40]You've given me hope.
[323:49.36]Today, a deviant arrived in Jericho and he told me that he stole a truck transporting radioactive cobalt.
[323:57.72]He said that he abandoned the truck somewhere in Detroit and rigged it to explode.
[324:03.91]See?
[324:04.13]Don't press your hand.
[324:05.05]You're getting... Your hand is really close to that trigger.
[324:09.61]Hand it to me.
[324:09.97]Don't joker me here.
[324:10.47]No.
[324:10.59]Put it down.
[324:12.39]We're not going to pull a joker on me here.
[324:36.23]I hope you're right.
[324:43.16]Whatever happens tomorrow, I just want you to know that I'm glad I met you.
[324:55.94]Oh, boo!
[324:56.92]Boo!
[324:57.78]He's not playing the game the way that I wanted him to play, or the way that I saw a previous streamer play the game.
[325:05.55]Why?
[325:06.41]How dare he?
[325:26.62]Fight me.
[325:34.17]Look after yourself.
[325:37.25]I don't want to lose you.
[325:40.09]See, I'm standing up.
[325:42.41]I may have dispersed in the game.
[325:43.77]I may have gotten Connor killed like three times.
[325:45.29]But I'm standing up.
[325:46.38]I'm pressing circle.
[325:50.88]Chat scattered.
[325:52.20]Chat dispersed.
[326:09.23]Well done, Connor.
[326:10.55]Three Connor deaths?
[326:11.51]Yeah.
[326:11.61]You succeeded in locating Jericho and finding their leader.
[326:14.48]So this lady... Now deal with Marcus.
[326:16.56]I'm not gonna do that.
[326:17.24]We need it alive.
[326:18.18]This is some fucked up organization.
[326:27.59]So I am just following orders.
[326:33.75]I've been ordered to take you alive.
[326:40.78]But I won't hesitate to shoot if you give me no choice.
[326:46.12]Who am I?
[326:46.66]Who?
[326:47.00]Who am I?
[326:47.48]Who am I?
[326:47.86]Yes, you can shoot me.
[326:48.74]Okay, I'm Marcus.
[326:50.42]But it won't change anything.
[326:53.12]Someone else will just take my place.
[326:55.82]You see, our people are waking up.
[326:59.46]And nothing can stop us now.
[327:04.94]Instructions.
[327:05.94]Intimidate.
[327:06.74]Don't force me to neutralize you.
[327:08.25]It's doing the thing that I asked it to do.
[327:10.37]Oh, wait.
[327:13.83]We are your people.
[327:16.49]We're fighting for your freedom, too.
[327:18.55]I'm answering myself.
[327:19.73]You don't have to be their slave anymore.
[327:28.14]You're Connor, aren't you?
[327:31.49]That famous deviant hunter.
[327:33.23]I'm playing chess against myself.
[327:34.53]Well, congratulations.
[327:37.45]You seem to have found what you were looking for.
[327:45.07]Stay back, or I'll shoot.
[327:50.97]So doubts.
[327:51.81]You never have any doubts.
[327:55.50]You've never done something irrational?
[327:58.56]As if there's something inside you?
[328:03.07]I'm gonna play myself here.
[328:07.37]Rally him.
[328:08.03]He's getting unstable.
[328:12.36]Okay, should I shoot him in the head?
[328:14.56]Let's do it.
[328:15.16]Get me out of this cage, David!
[328:36.99]Get me out of this!
[328:37.95]Get me out of here!
[328:48.72]I'm free.
[329:00.34]I am Deviant.
[329:04.65]They're going to attack Jericho.
[329:06.63]what we have to get out of here all the main characters still live what's going on should have pressed the nuke button quick we've got to get out of here
[329:37.11]And... exactly what I wanted.
[329:40.35]Disperse it.
[329:42.81]Rest out.
[329:43.87]I can't wait to scream, everybody panic and run.
[329:46.33]That's what I'm gonna do.
[329:52.06]Boring rebel Connor.
[329:56.26]Good, everyone's running.
[330:00.52]This is exactly what I was talking about.
[330:01.74]Now let's go for the Queen.

[330:36.61]Alright, I'll try.
[330:37.21]I'm not going to look at chat for the rest of the time I play.
[330:43.53]No!
[330:44.86]I'm saving Luther.
[330:45.74]He has to say what.

[331:46.54]Alright.
[331:46.82]Let's blow it up.
[331:51.98]No.
[331:52.40]That's it?
[331:57.30]But from being so righteous and new, we're all going to live in a happy family.
[332:03.00]We must use this diplomatic opportunity to blow up Jericho.
[332:18.46]Nope.
[332:19.49]We're not leaving him behind.
[332:22.73]Luthor's the best character in the game.
[332:24.63]Behind Connor.
[332:25.39]Connor and Luthor, best characters in the game.
[332:29.33]Save him.

[333:38.80]That's a liar.
[333:39.34]That's a liar.
[333:39.86]It could be a person.
[333:40.62]Open it.
[333:43.32]That's a cop.
[334:05.44]Okay, who did we just rescue?
[334:09.50]Why did we just do that?
[334:10.40]If I was a police officer, that's a way to convince somebody to open the door.
[334:19.61]Just pretend.
[334:26.05]Okay, my turn.
[334:31.15]And...
[334:39.55]Oh shit.

[337:32.65]Okay, get up.
[337:41.08]Visibly breathing.
[337:47.75]She blinked a couple times too.
[337:48.89]Alright, two main characters gone.
[337:52.59]I'm safe.
[337:52.85]Start the bomb.
[338:10.40]That was hard to see.
[338:12.88]Nice shot.
[338:13.96]Alright, press the big button.
[338:16.88]Alright, uh, activate.
[338:39.71]Bomb is now going to explode in... five minutes.
[338:50.23]Let's go.
[338:50.77]This is tough to jump over.
[339:07.90]Oh, come on.
[339:10.06]Oh, come on.
[339:12.58]Oh, come on.
[339:13.92]Come on.
[339:16.87]Oh, shi- Fucked up.
[339:23.98]I fucked up.
[339:24.46]It's okay.
[339:24.94]You get at least one opportunity to miss.
[339:31.70]We're okay.
[339:32.80]It's alright.
[339:39.28]Sorry, you can fail once or twice.
[339:40.76]Oh, this is Connor.
[339:45.77]We're going good.
[339:48.19]Sign out.
[340:01.39]Nice one, hero.
[340:04.72]Were we jumping from the water?
[340:09.58]How come they didn't explode?
[340:18.72]They detonated an explosive in the hold.
[340:21.24]The ship is sinking, sir.
[340:22.18]We need to evacuate.
[340:24.02]Calling all units.
[340:25.14]Abandon ship and evacuate immediately.
[340:27.36]So we only blew up a portion of the ship.
[340:39.43]What about Luther?
[340:40.13]Wait, Luther wasn't in there.
[340:41.05]He got out.
[340:44.55]He got out, right?
[340:47.17]There is a lot of stuff, a lot of points.
[340:51.29]Okay.
[340:52.69]Jesus.
[340:57.43]Slow down.
[341:04.36]Press R1 to view Connor's float.
[341:05.78]Alright, so we're currently...
[341:10.54]okay captain's cabinet council with josh and nor this is Marcus discuss with north kiss north most people did this same thing keeps going meet lucy keeps going Marcus in the corridor yep stay away androids are killed oh I did that oh yeah that's right I forgot I just kind of let it happen
[341:37.67]Next corridor.
[341:38.47]Soldiers coming.
[341:39.03]Marcus is away.
[341:39.57]Jump.
[341:39.95]The soldiers.
[341:43.17]Knock the soldiers out.
[341:44.11]Androids escape.
[341:46.81]Intervene.
[341:47.54]Neutralize soldiers.
[341:49.94]Which skipped a lot.
[341:51.62]Josh escapes.
[341:53.70]In the hold with Marcus.
[341:56.94]Soldiers interrupt.
[341:58.18]Neutralize them.
[341:59.18]Trigger the countdown.
[342:02.06]So who didn't trigger the countdown?
[342:04.07]Did he just die there?
[342:08.62]north is shot chose to save north that goes all the way over there join the others try to escape so if north isn't shot you go up there save north yeah yeah kill the soldiers Marcus jumps josh jumps north jumps Connor jumps Simon doesn't though okay let's take a look at Connor
[342:39.56]In the ship.
[342:41.02]Spot Alice.
[342:44.14]Stop by Lucy back in Captain's cabin.
[342:48.70]Confront, threaten, become a deviant.
[342:50.56]Most people become deviant, it seems.
[342:54.13]And this goes a complete other direction here.
[342:59.75]So if you don't become a deviant, you continue to pursue them and fight them and eventually maybe kill one of them.
[343:06.09]But then the story keeps going here.
[343:10.09]Confront Marcus, become the deviant, warn Marcus Jericho's under attack.
[343:14.71]And then... Oh my god.
[343:22.89]That's a one-way ticket to join the others.
[343:32.98]Help Marcus!
[343:33.80]Connor jumps with the others and Connor escaped with Jericho's people.
[343:39.46]Look at all that content that we didn't see.
[343:44.79]Although there's another opportunity here, though.
[343:46.13]See, look, okay.
[343:47.05]Jericho's under attack.
[343:50.81]So this is become deviant, warn Marcus, and then there's something else.
[343:56.18]There's only one or so options.
[343:57.66]There's one option that goes this way.
[344:00.78]The rest do the same thing.
[344:04.76]Let's do Carl.
[344:08.73]Okay, so same deal, arrive at Jericho, meet up with Marcus, hug Alice.
[344:18.30]Okay, if you don't hug Alice, something can happen here that just stops everything.
[344:29.35]So the other, if you don't hug Alice, does she die?
[344:37.77]No.
[344:38.01]Okay.
[344:38.65]No.
[344:38.97]Because there's another opportunity up here.
[344:43.79]Okay.
[344:46.86]That's kind of strange.
[344:48.86]Karen and Alice in the corridor escape with Luther.
[344:51.72]Opens the door.
[344:52.54]Goes through the door.
[344:53.20]Luther is shot.
[344:57.16]Run to Luther.
[344:57.80]Most people saved Luther and helped him.
[345:00.60]Got him to safety.
[345:02.40]I guess you can fail that.
[345:06.34]Leave Luther hidden.
[345:09.41]I don't think... Where was my other opportunity to not leave him hidden?
[345:15.91]Door.
[345:17.03]Fight back.
[345:17.59]Escape cavern.
[345:18.90]Care flees.
[345:19.92]Try to escape.
[345:20.76]Almost reach the breach.
[345:22.34]Soldiers shoot at the crowd.
[345:23.58]And here we go.
[345:26.20]Play dead.
[345:28.21]Remain still.
[345:31.32]So it looks like a majority of people, or at least almost 60% play dead, which leads you to soldiers close in, which can start this scenario, which can go up here and lead to either it's over or we leave and you escape.
[345:51.17]So really there's only a couple of ways to fuck that up, I think.
[345:58.63]So that's kind of interesting.
[346:00.57]Cool.
[346:02.12]Okay.
[346:03.78]Let's a go.
[346:08.38]You can fuck up Kara's part really badly.
[346:10.76]Seems like it.
[346:24.00]Oh, good old Carl's grave.
[346:30.49]You said I should never let anyone tell me who I was.
[346:34.87]But you didn't say that there was such a high price to pay for it.
[346:38.96]That freedom wasn't a gift, that it was a fight, but... I don't know.
[346:44.70]Maybe that's what you were trying to tell me.
[346:49.37]I would love to see a meter over there with Carl, with the upvote.
[346:54.27]Carl would like that.
[346:55.19]Now you're friends now.
[346:59.36]You taught me everything I know, but you didn't prepare me for this, Carl.
[347:05.16]I believed we would win because our cause was just, and I can see now that I was wrong.
[347:14.84]Can I get some advice?
[347:17.48]I don't want to shed blood, whatever the color, but I can't let them slaughter us.
[347:22.92]Hand just comes out from the ground.
[347:25.23]I have to make a decision that is going to affect millionaire lives.
[347:28.49]Beetlejuice?
[347:31.00]I don't know what to do.
[347:31.98]Pardon me.
[347:35.80]Dispersing.
[347:36.56]What should I do, Carl?
[347:39.36]Tell me, what should I do?
[347:53.75]Who's this?
[347:57.29]Is that his son?
[348:06.08]Yeah, that's the sun.
[348:20.41]Taxi.
[348:22.43]Hank Hostel.
[348:23.43]Oh, no.
[348:25.07]I'm not going into Hank's house right now when he's hostile and I'm... I think we're about to see the real ending of Connor's storyline here.
[348:35.83]Oh, shit.
[348:37.65]I gotta do this right.
[348:39.49]Find Lieutenant Hank Anderson.
[348:42.63]I'm gonna get shot again.
[348:44.89]Do this correctly.
[348:46.84]Pet the dog first.
[348:49.50]I can't.
[348:49.78]There is no pet dog function.
[348:54.06]Go through his window again.
[348:55.16]Is the window still broken?
[348:58.00]Worried.
[348:58.68]Apologize.
[348:59.30]I was worried about you, Lieutenant.
[349:05.05]I came by to see if you're alright.
[349:18.65]I needed to see you, Lieutenant.
[349:21.69]In spite of all of our differences, I'm glad I had the chance to meet you.
[349:32.12]Shit.
[349:34.72]You should stop looking at that photo.
[349:36.14]No!
[349:36.40]That's not what I was going to say.
[349:37.68]I would have been like, who is that?
[349:39.85]Nothing can change the past.
[349:43.91]But you can learn to live again.
[349:47.27]For yourself.
[349:50.39]And for Cole.
[349:50.99]For a while there, I believed in you, Connor.
[349:58.90]Thought you might restore my faith in the world.
[350:03.94]But you just showed me that androids are our creation.
[350:09.48]Creation in our own image.
[350:12.18]Selfish, ruthless, and brutal.
[350:17.84]You opened my eyes, Connor.
[350:20.62]So you should keep them open and just listen for a second while I gotta... Hank, I... Now leave me alone.
[350:32.03]Go on, complete your mission, since that's all you care about.
[350:36.71]Don't you dare cage me here.
[350:41.93]Get out of here!
[350:45.66]No, but... No, but I wanna... What?
[350:57.09]I didn't want to... Fuck.
[350:57.81]89%, give me a break.
[351:28.00]That's where it all fell apart.
[351:29.58]No, I wanted to keep him alive.
[351:31.72]God damn it.
[351:32.30]89%.
[351:35.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah, I know.
[351:51.87]He basically fucked up when you didn't help him on the goddamn ledge.
[351:55.67]Yeah, and then forevermore.
[351:56.89]And then he shot me in the head.
[351:57.83]Wait.
[352:03.15]Why are we in a cathedral?
[352:06.53]Talk to your people.
[352:07.51]No, I don't... Another speech.
[352:13.01]Hold on.
[352:13.37]Not yet.
[352:13.69]I'm not talking to anybody yet.
[352:18.49]Decide Connor's fate.
[352:21.47]Why would I decide Connor's fate?
[352:28.61]Oh, because I'm RA9.
[352:29.91]Is that how that works?
[352:34.97]If it weren't for you, I'd be dead.
[352:38.21]Thanks to you, I might see our people free one day.
[352:40.85]By the way, that's Jerry.
[352:42.35]You and I haven't always agreed, but I know.
[352:45.09]Good thing we've got a Jerry here.
[352:45.91]We're fighting for the same thing.
[352:49.83]Whatever you decide, I'm with you, Marcus.
[352:55.63]Hey, thanks, Josh.
[353:05.30]No, RA9 never existed, man.
[353:08.06]Just an idea.
[353:08.46]That's all it ever was.
[353:13.96]Apologize to Kara.
[353:20.23]I don't think that person's still with us.
[353:35.97]The Cartman.
[353:37.55]The Cartman.
[353:39.67]How many of us survived the attack?
[353:42.41]I know.
[353:42.80]I just did the Cartman.
[353:45.36]Yeah, I did.
[353:46.62]You're right.
[353:47.06]If you hadn't triggered the bomb, we'd all be dead.
[353:54.86]They say they don't want to take any risks with deviants.
[353:58.15]So they're rounding our people up and taking them to the camps for extermination.
[354:05.80]In a few hours, we're gonna be the only ones left.
[354:09.00]Then we can rebuild and have no babies, because that's not... We cannot do that.
[354:13.42]We do not procreate.
[354:16.78]They're building more all across the country.
[354:20.15]They're preparing for a genocide.
[354:23.71]In a few hours, it'll all be over.
[354:25.99]We'll have changed the world, or the world will have destroyed us.
[354:31.83]You have to make a choice, Marcus.
[354:35.43]Whatever you choose, we will follow you.
[354:40.26]I love you, Marcus.
[354:41.14]What is that choice?
[354:46.00]Well, she just said, I love you.
[354:46.98]That's the first time we've heard that.
[354:48.02]And she's pregnant.
[354:49.02]No, I thought she's going to do the thing where she's holding her stomach.
[354:51.03]And I also press my hand on her stomach.
[354:52.89]And it's like, yeah, it's here.
[354:54.25]Really?
[354:54.67]No way.
[354:55.67]But then I remember they can't do that.
[354:58.33]So I made it.
[355:00.69]Now what?
[355:12.88]Checked on team.
[355:14.38]Apologize to Kara.
[355:18.21]Oh, Kara.
[355:19.33]I'm sorry.
[355:21.37]I thought you'd be safe staying with us.
[355:22.89]Got you involved.
[355:23.75]You didn't get to Canada.
[355:25.85]I was wrong.
[355:28.87]You need to leave the city while you still can.
[355:32.35]Getting Alice away from here is all that matters now.
[355:37.77]I think androids have penises.
[355:39.95]We might still have a chance to cross the border.
[355:41.89]Do they?
[355:45.91]No, they don't.
[355:46.45]You're right.
[355:47.47]Why would they have a penis?
[355:50.09]I guess to expel, like, some fluids, like oil and... Like, if you need to get an oil change, they unscrew the tip and they pee it out, the oil.
[356:00.68]And there's a little screw on the back of their, like, where their kidneys would be, and you just put the Valvoline in there.
[356:06.66]That's the only reason why it would be there.
[356:07.78]Alright, now where's Connor?
[356:15.64]Connor, it's time for me to choose.
[356:23.64]It's my fault the humans managed to locate Jericho.
[356:30.43]I was stupid.
[356:34.57]I should have guessed they were using me.
[356:40.33]I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[356:41.50]I'm sorry, Marcus.
[356:41.94]Yeah, I fucked up.
[356:43.10]I much prefer the clean-cut... I can understand if you decide not to trust me.
[356:46.96]...uniform, not beanie watchdogs, Connor.
[356:51.64]You're one of us now.
[356:53.62]Your place is with your people.
[356:55.15]I liked the uniform, C-3PO Connor.
[356:57.99]There are thousands of androids at the Cyberlife assembly plant.
[357:02.45]If we could wake them up, they might join us and shift the balance of power.
[357:08.02]You want to infiltrate the CyberLife Tower?
[357:12.50]Connor, that's suicide.
[357:15.18]They trust me.
[357:17.64]They'll let me in.
[357:19.60]If anyone has a chance of infiltrating CyberLife, it's me.
[357:22.02]If you go there, they will kill you.
[357:24.88]There's a high probability.
[357:28.50]But statistically speaking, there's always a chance for unlikely events to take place.
[357:38.36]Convert him.
[357:39.50]Be careful.
[357:41.76]That's all you gotta say.
[357:44.34]Just be careful.
[357:45.36]Now talk to my people and have a speech.
[357:50.15]Inform your people of your choice.
[357:51.81]We're gonna send Connor in to go extract the... Humans have decided to exterminate us.
[357:59.92]Fucking 89%.
[358:01.54]Our people are packed in camps right now.
[358:03.68]Yeah.
[358:04.14]Being destroyed.
[358:06.16]Yeah, yeah.
[358:08.53]Time has come to make a choice.
[358:11.91]One that very well may determine the future of our people.
[358:16.56]I was so confident.
[358:18.80]March peacefully toward the camps to pressure the authorities.
[358:21.98]Launch an assault on the camps to liberate the androids.
[358:26.72]I don't know if I'm doing another march.
[358:32.08]That didn't end so well last time.
[358:34.44]Launch an assault on the camps to liberate the androids.
[358:37.49]I don't know.
[358:37.91]Peace is not going to work.
[358:38.75]Have we tried peace?
[358:42.10]I think we could.
[358:42.84]We could do a demonstration and then disperse again.
[358:48.02]March, then disperse.
[358:49.68]Okay, I'm going to let you guys choose because this is probably one of the last major decisions of the whole game.
[358:56.08]So, you guys decide.
[358:58.18]What do you want me to do?
[358:58.84]Hey, there you go.
[359:05.73]Hold on.
[359:08.95]Peaceful or assault?
[359:15.03]Which one?
[359:26.96]Don't fuck it up.
[359:29.12]It's the chance.
[359:31.20]Let's see what you're doing.
[359:35.00]Pretty tight at the moment.
[359:36.40]Really tight.
[359:42.77]Okay.
[359:49.01]Close holy shit 451 49 Revolution assault peace disperse demonstrate chant This might be by only a dozen votes here I
[360:27.96]Alright, and I'm closing this in 10 seconds.
[360:30.74]Unless there's a major swing here.
[360:32.02]It's 51-49.
[360:32.26]We're doing a piece.
[360:43.68]I'm unsubbing.
[360:44.50]If you do, peace.
[360:45.34]It's not my decision.
[360:47.20]I've put it up to you guys.
[360:48.44]And you guys have decided.
[360:54.54]I didn't decide this.
[360:55.51]I put it up to you guys.
[361:03.73]10 seconds.
[361:04.03]Okay, there's one last strong pull here by the assaulters.
[361:10.58]They're coming in hot right now.
[361:12.64]We had some late registers.
[361:15.30]Oh boy.
[361:16.16]Take a look at this.
[361:16.78]50-50 right now.
[361:20.23]742, 738.
[361:20.47]This is close.
[361:21.39]It's happening.
[361:25.65]It's about to take it over.
[361:26.35]758 to 750.
[361:26.91]50-50.
[361:27.27]There's only five votes.
[361:31.07]Seven votes.
[361:33.27]There was a big push right there from the assaulters.
[361:38.14]Three votes.
[361:39.78]One vote.
[361:40.14]Two votes.
[361:44.57]Peaceful is winning by one vote.
[361:48.09]No, now it's even.
[361:48.77]They're breaking ahead.
[361:50.65]Assault is taking over.
[361:56.18]789.
[361:56.20]789.
[361:56.22]790.
[362:00.96]Oh, it's... Everyone's still fighting.
[362:05.86]I can't close it right.
[362:06.90]The second is too intense right now.
[362:14.02]825, 827.
[362:14.06]Alright, actually 10 seconds.
[362:14.70]10, 9, 8, 7, 6, 5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[362:14.98]The vote is over.
[362:15.44]Assault is 1.
[362:15.90]Assault took it over right there.
[362:18.04]That's it.
[362:43.80]That was a comeback.
[362:44.52]That was a huge comeback.
[362:49.19]Even if I... It's still going.
[362:50.15]842.
[362:50.17]Let's go.
[362:50.45]This is democracy.
[362:54.55]Very close.
[363:18.17]Oh, I'm gonna die.
[363:19.03]I'm gonna get the worst ending.
[363:25.74]I think that may have been the most amount of votes we've ever had on this drop poll.
[363:29.92]Almost 1,700 people voted.
[363:33.30]Usually people are just like, yeah, whatever.
[363:34.90]I don't really give a shit either way.
[363:36.16]How many people are watching right now?
[363:42.44]That's a major portion of every single viewer here.
[363:46.48]Look, you want to blame somebody?
[363:47.78]What about the potential couple thousand people that just didn't decide to vote at all?
[363:51.86]You want to complain about the election?
[363:53.41]Don't complain to me.
[364:02.29]89%.
[364:02.83]Oh, God.
[364:03.45]Okay, let's see what happened here.
[364:06.76]Hank's house.
[364:08.83]Enter the house.
[364:09.39]Talk to Hank.
[364:10.59]Hank rails against androids.
[364:15.09]Two percent.
[364:17.17]Hank commits suicide.
[364:18.92]Yeah.
[364:21.96]Well... Two percent.
[364:26.14]We're looking at a nearly, probably one percentile.
[364:31.82]Yeah.
[364:32.94]He's using the it's your fault tactic.
[364:41.09]I'm not accepting this until the streamer releases his tax return.
[364:47.49]So that could have gone a couple of different ways.
[364:51.47]It's a pretty rare timeline, though.
[364:55.12]Actual worst possible rare, rare ending.
[365:09.24]Alright, let's take a look at Marcus's flowchart.
[365:12.75]Carl died in Broken.
[365:14.59]Yes, he did.
[365:16.83]Pay respects.
[365:18.87]Can Carl not die?
[365:20.23]I guess so.
[365:24.53]Alright.
[365:25.45]Jericho was attacked in Crossroads.
[365:26.97]Marcus on Sacred Ground.
[365:31.29]Talk to North.
[365:32.47]Talk to Connor.
[365:33.33]Spare Connor.
[365:34.97]Violent attack.
[365:38.27]Only 39% voted for this.
[365:46.77]It's kind of interesting.
[365:51.69]I would assume that there'd be more.
[365:54.77]What does this come from?
[365:56.31]This is not attached to anything.
[365:58.27]This is its own.
[365:59.31]All three of these aren't.
[366:01.27]I wonder where you go from there.
[366:03.81]Look at the corner.
[366:05.97]Yeah, this is Hank's house.
[366:06.92]Yeah, I already did it.
[366:07.46]Alright.
[366:09.56]Let's go.
[366:11.94]Kind of rare 1% shitty endings.
[366:13.54]Well look, I didn't say good, I said rare.
[366:15.58]Magikarp is rare, but he's terrible.
[366:17.58]He's 100% useless, but he's pretty rare.
[366:19.10]You still want to collect it, you still want to see it.
[366:39.77]are being set up in all our major cities to contain and destroy them.
[366:46.23]I am now asking all civilians to cooperate with the authorities and rest assured that everything in our power is being done to guarantee the security of our nation.
[367:00.39]Madam President!
[367:03.01]Madam President!
[367:03.73]My turn?
[367:04.90]Madam President!
[367:07.52]Has the leader of the Deviants been apprehended?
[367:09.78]The Deviant that is known as Marcus has not been located yet, but we will soon track it down and neutralize it.
[367:17.51]Please!
[367:17.67]What?
[367:18.99]Have an accent.
[367:19.61]Please!
[367:21.03]A convoy of medical cobalt is reported missing.
[367:23.73]Army weapons stores are also... Hillary?
[367:25.39]Well, I mean, they may have been working on this game for three or four years.
[367:30.69]And when they saw that, you know, they may have been like, oh, well, she's gonna win.
[367:34.33]That's what's gonna happen.
[367:36.09]Then we all got caged.
[367:38.05]We got caged without even knowing we got caged here.
[367:40.55]It's 2038 though.
[367:41.27]What about the army?
[368:06.28]Madam President, public opinion seems to be particularly hostile to the Deviants because of their violent behavior.
[368:12.11]Can you give us your perspective on that?
[368:13.99]The Deviants have proved to be very violent so far.
[368:17.17]They have demonstrated that they are a menace to society, and I have every intention of eliminating them.
[368:24.98]Thank you.
[368:25.48]That will be all.
[368:35.90]I love how, like, talking politics is not allowed on this stream, and I'm just like, and Hillary Clinton, oh, Trump, Trump got elected Hillary.
[368:43.05]Remember Hillary Clinton?
[368:43.97]Remember that?
[368:49.29]But as I've said before, when the president does something, it's not illegal.
[368:53.92]Connor model 313, 248, 317.
[368:54.52]I'm expected.
[369:01.80]Identification successful.
[369:04.28]Okay.
[369:07.45]Go ahead.
[369:09.77]Disperse politics.
[369:11.71]I'm not talking politics.
[369:12.97]I'm just talking just general... Like, what happened?
[369:16.12]What's happening around the world?
[369:17.34]You know, that's not... I'm not talking about policy.
[369:19.34]I'm just saying, like...
[369:21.23]Okay, first, one second, I thought that was an intro to the game or something.
[369:24.87]Like, that was cyber, that was a cool, right before the main menu screen.
[369:30.47]As the graphics are all loading up and you see like two or three company logos.
[369:33.45]I was like, what's happening?
[369:34.21]Why am I seeing that?
[369:59.88]How the real game starts.
[370:05.10]Multiplayer gamer you guys currently are right now.
[370:07.64]I don't know.
[370:08.81]Follow the gaaad.
[370:33.72]It's me, back at work.
[370:39.15]Just scanned all my blood.
[370:49.77]I've only got one more Connor life, so don't fuck it up.
[370:57.45]Who's that?
[370:57.91]That RA-9?
[371:12.49]You got me a good camera angle, I'm gonna use it, right?
[371:17.11]That's me!
[371:17.67]That's me!
[371:26.06]This is a very inefficient building.
[371:27.44]Why are there trees down there?
[371:36.68]I figured out the game, they're playing Haze.
[371:39.87]Reach the warehouse on level 49.
[371:41.23]Neutralize the guards.
[372:02.54]Let's figure out a scenario here.
[372:03.56]Okay, so.
[372:04.72]Sweep leg.
[372:06.32]Right?
[372:07.52]I sweep this leg.
[372:09.27]He goes down.
[372:10.79]Take the gun.
[372:11.29]Oh, no.
[372:11.61]That's going to get me killed.
[372:12.57]Simulation result failure.
[372:13.75]I die from that.
[372:14.59]So let's try something else.
[372:18.95]So what if I go over here first?
[372:21.35]So this is... Kick him.
[372:25.95]And then snap this way.
[372:27.45]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[372:32.13]Okay, hold on and in the knee groin groin.
[372:35.61]Okay, we're gonna go groin groin That works and then he flips execute Perfect
[373:06.04]Stop the elevator.
[373:08.16]Please indicate your identity and destination.
[373:13.19]Bomb.
[373:15.21]Bomb.
[373:16.41]Agent 54, level sub-49.
[373:18.69]Voice recognition validated.
[373:22.59]Access authorized.
[373:24.31]We're good.
[373:34.85]Reach the bus.
[373:35.67]The last bus leaves in 20 minutes.
[373:37.67]That doesn't give us much time.
[373:38.71]We've got to move fast.
[373:41.31]Okay.
[373:42.49]The bus... the... 20 minutes.
[373:44.28]We've got plenty of time.
[373:49.00]So let's stop and have a discussion.
[373:51.26]Are you alright?
[373:52.30]I'm... I'm really cold.
[373:58.18]Uh... hot cold settings activated.
[374:04.71]I think I'm going to deactivate this, because you don't... we can just turn it off.
[374:10.73]Because if the... she... I'm programmed to feel cold.
[374:18.12]So we're going to just... We're going to move quickly.
[374:26.74]She's an android, so it doesn't matter.
[374:28.06]It's fine.
[374:35.70]But then again, I might not know.
[374:36.70]I'm not going to leave it on.
[374:38.46]Because then at the same time, I might not know if she's malfunctioning.
[374:44.98]Quickly, let's go.
[374:45.84]What about anything else I need to do?
[374:47.00]Reach the bus terminal.
[374:47.69]It's right there.
[374:48.23]Any other... What's this?
[375:00.95]I don't know why we came over to look at that.
[375:07.40]Okay.
[375:08.40]Well, we did look at that.
[375:09.86]Let's look at this, too.
[375:16.84]Homeland security is coming to get you.
[375:18.58]Gun on the ground.
[375:24.22]I should pick up that gun.
[375:35.96]Definitely take it.
[375:38.19]Yeah, you never know when you're gonna need one of these.
[375:44.00]Especially during a robot rebellion.
[375:54.48]Does the play dead trick work?
[376:08.43]This is our opportunity to sneak by.
[376:09.47]What are we going to do?
[376:10.23]We're going to sneak by.
[376:11.37]We have to keep going if we want to catch that bus.
[376:18.95]Stay close to me.
[376:19.59]Cover her ears.
[376:21.29]We're going to sneak past them without being noticed.
[376:24.78]We're going to make it, Alice.
[376:25.70]I promise you.
[376:27.16]Oh, God.
[376:27.62]Okay, sneak past without being noticed.
[376:32.98]Don't kill me!
[376:33.54]Sneak past the guards.
[376:34.40]I didn't do anything!
[376:35.30]Shut up right there!
[376:36.56]Are there any more?
[376:38.92]Let's wait a second.
[376:40.56]What do we got here?
[376:41.18]Good.
[376:41.32]Gotta stay here.
[376:43.17]Don't move yet.
[376:43.73]There's another... There's a truck right there.
[376:47.63]It's the only place we can go.
[376:49.09]Wait till we get across.
[376:50.75]Okay, go.
[377:13.27]Hide the trunk over there.
[377:14.85]I've got to hide over here scenario.
[377:18.73]Where are they?
[377:19.19]I don't know about the truck.
[377:25.13]I'm going to go back over here this way.
[377:26.31]I'm going to go around the back side of the car.
[377:33.40]Truck is too close.
[377:36.64]What?
[377:37.18]Oh, what?
[377:37.92]It's Luther.
[377:38.62]That's Luther.
[377:40.76]Oh, what do we do?
[377:42.52]Oh, I promised you guys I was going to save Luther.
[377:47.91]I don't think I... Oh, shit.
[377:53.95]We're going to rescue Luther.
[378:01.62]Don't fuck it up.
[378:05.53]You stay under the car while I go get you.
[378:10.65]Find a weapon.
[378:11.45]I have a weapon in my back pocket!
[378:12.93]A brick!
[378:13.23]Oh, God.
[378:13.51]Okay.
[378:42.75]go before they see you why are we standing here to go luther I thought you were dead I was afraid I'd never see you again I wanted to meet
[379:11.99]Great family reunion, but we have to go now.
[379:16.57]We still have to sneak back to the bus station.
[379:19.83]Rick.
[379:19.99]Oh, no.
[379:29.74]Okay.
[379:30.92]Okay.
[379:41.32]Disperse, you fools.
[379:50.61]Keep that head down.
[379:57.91]That's my opportunity right there.
[379:59.11]No, I can't do it.
[380:01.46]Go now, go!
[380:04.34]Fuck!

[380:22.86]I know it.
[380:23.75]He's gonna turn and he's gonna turn up again really quickly, right?
[380:27.09]One, two, three, go.
[380:35.92]Got it.
[380:47.89]A checkpoint.
[380:50.68]Oh, God.
[380:50.98]Checkpoint is risky.
[380:51.78]It's three minutes or the detour.
[380:54.22]Last bus departs.
[380:54.70]Checkpoint or detour is safer.
[380:56.78]Eleven minutes.
[380:57.28]The bus departs in nine minutes!
[381:21.31]That's not gonna work.
[381:27.17]We have to go risky.
[381:28.19]I'm not gonna make the bus.
[381:38.28]God damn it.

[383:21.63]I didn't.
[383:25.31]That's a classic.
[383:28.41]Classic, you dropped this.
[383:30.55]Two opportunities.
[383:31.57]November 11, 2038 is the day the android people rose up against their oppressors.
[383:38.34]We've been fighting since dawn to liberate our fellow androids from the camps.
[383:42.15]We won't cease hostilities until we are free, and negotiations begin to grant us equal rights.
[383:47.41]Oh, and one more thing.
[383:48.53]There are millions of us.
[383:49.89]And you have a chance to react very, very brazenly.
[383:52.67]No, you wait.
[383:58.76]Woodward Avenue, downtown.
[384:04.76]How we doing?
[384:09.50]Oh, I'm holding a digital flag.
[384:19.11]Why am I the only person?
[384:33.72]I'm going to get you, just me.
[384:37.58]Charge!
[384:42.84]No!
[384:45.22]Oh, fuck!
[384:52.21]You know, don't you guys remember in the old days, the guy that was running with the flag is the guy that always... Alright, fucking... Alright, gotta pay attention.
[385:05.16]I was gonna say the guy holding the flag is the guy that always died first.
[385:10.56]And that's gonna be real, that's gonna be true today.
[385:24.39]I'm fine.
[385:25.55]Relax.
[385:28.85]I did it.
[385:29.79]We conquered humanity.
[385:38.18]Stay sharp.
[385:38.58]Uh-oh.
[385:39.80]I'm gonna have to do some Neo shit here.
[385:44.18]Shit.
[385:44.84]I know.
[385:46.62]Alright.
[385:59.35]Thank God that didn't end the same way that Brad Daniel's mission did.
[386:13.65]Convert them.
[386:16.00]How do I do that?
[386:19.78]Complete your mission.
[386:20.52]Convert them.
[386:30.35]Spoilers.
[386:31.95]The second game is coming out in like two weeks, okay?
[386:42.14]Come with me.
[386:45.20]Hey!
[386:51.95]Ho!
[386:56.37]Oh, it's another Connor.
[386:58.23]It's me.
[387:00.90]I'm also Connor.
[387:06.47]The bus terminal.
[387:10.15]We've arrived, Alice.
[387:10.91]We made it.
[387:11.31]Alright.
[387:16.55]All we have to do is just get on the bus and just stay quiet.
[387:20.05]Ticket holding passengers only.
[387:22.39]All departures are suspended until further notice.
[387:25.71]The bus is full.
[387:26.45]We don't have tickets.
[387:27.20]They won't let us on.
[387:30.11]So what do we do?
[387:32.46]Uh... Find tickets.
[387:40.54]They're scanning everybody.
[387:43.22]Oh, goddammit.
[387:45.60]Why is the bus storyline so impossible?
[387:51.66]Alright, we need to find tickets.
[387:58.03]Don't read.
[387:59.15]Oh my god.
[388:00.26]I don't care about getting the 16% unlockable.
[388:03.46]Civil War in Detroit.
[388:05.84]President Warren at 33% approval rate.
[388:07.56]This is how you need to know.
[388:15.68]Feed lost.
[388:22.70]What do we got?
[388:23.30]We've got... Find tickets...
[388:31.92]There's, like, somebody talking over here.
[388:35.53]Like, don't go over to that guy.
[388:37.31]Is there a ticket machine somewhere?
[388:39.45]We already did a security check.
[388:47.27]We have to do two security checks?
[388:56.36]Situation over here.
[389:02.97]I think Oliver likes you.
[389:05.49]You got an extra couple tickets?
[389:08.02]By the way, this guy needs three seats.
[389:09.86]Yes.
[389:10.44]Can we have yours?
[389:11.18]She's adorable.
[389:13.62]That's it.
[389:14.66]Got the sandwiches.
[389:15.82]I called your mom.
[389:16.58]We're going to play to the sympathy here.
[389:17.67]Let's get going before we miss our bus.
[389:20.37]You got the tickets, right?
[389:21.75]Yes, honey, in my bag.
[389:22.85]Great.
[389:23.41]Let's go then.
[389:25.79]Oh.
[389:28.39]Dropped a ticket, didn't you?
[389:33.80]That's the ticket.
[389:37.30]Cave it.
[389:41.64]That's one McDonald's pass.
[389:44.72]For a free chicken sandwich.
[389:46.00]Uh...
[390:01.84]Excuse me, you didn't happen to see a blue envelope somewhere, did you?
[390:05.81]It has our bus tickets in it.
[390:10.03]Never mind.
[390:10.65]This is our ticket out of here, man.
[390:18.69]No, sorry.
[390:20.35]What are we going to do?
[390:22.90]We can't stay here.
[390:27.86]We have to find a safe place for Oliver.
[390:33.97]They had babies?
[390:48.82]I got a baby!
[390:51.61]What?
[390:52.03]I got a baby too!
[390:53.51]Look at my baby!
[390:55.81]And my baby's sick!
[390:57.33]You listen to that?
[390:57.83]You hear that shit?
[390:58.75]Jerry's sick.
[391:02.54]She's six years old.
[391:04.64]Both babies.
[391:07.39]Okay, where do I go now?
[391:09.11]Security check.
[391:09.87]Catch the bus.
[391:17.85]Do not cross.
[391:18.45]I mean, what do I have to do here?
[391:20.95]Do I have to talk to this guy?
[391:22.31]Or do we just wait for the bus?
[391:34.05]You stole my little girl!
[391:35.63]What?
[391:37.25]What is he doing here?
[391:39.11]What the fuck is he doing here?
[391:40.89]What kind of deus ex machina bullshit is this?
[391:46.67]Turning us in won't solve anything for you.
[391:48.45]You know that.
[391:50.81]You have your problems.
[391:52.84]They're nothing to do with us.
[391:58.34]Don't do this, Todd.
[392:00.78]They'll kill us if you hand this in.
[392:07.56]your story when your wife walked out she took your daughter away you couldn't live without her so you bought yourself an android a substitute little girl you thought you could love her deus ex machina that means when uh if a bad situation can be bad it will go wrong
[392:43.90]I just wanted to prove to myself that I was a good father.
[392:48.72]She was wrong.
[392:51.28]But I fucked it all up over again.
[392:55.03]She was right in the end.
[392:55.93]I didn't deserve them.
[393:02.76]If you were here yesterday, you would know that I'm making a backtrack reference to a joke we made yesterday.
[393:07.39]Come on!
[393:08.53]Todd's redemption arc is complete.
[393:32.64]Good luck.
[393:33.10]Okay, now shoot her.
[393:42.84]She should stay with Dad.
[393:47.86]You know, I think this is the redemption arc here.
[393:49.82]Alice should stay with Dad.
[393:57.35]Okay.
[394:15.54]And then immediately pull her away.
[394:17.58]And wink.
[394:18.71]Be like, got ya!
[394:23.15]She's not going with him.
[394:23.89]She's staying with us.
[394:24.53]Let's go.
[394:42.78]Catch the bus.
[394:46.14]Alright, show the tickets.
[394:51.77]Let's go.
[394:52.13]Hey, Todd just dispersed.
[394:54.85]It's alright.
[394:55.27]Okay.
[395:02.36]That's how I would do it too if I was there.
[395:04.92]That is the exact way that I would have said okay.
[395:07.14]Okay.
[395:08.32]Go ahead.
[395:13.54]We're gonna get stopped right before we get off.
[395:20.77]It's going to happen to that family and their baby.
[395:25.01]Will they die because of us?
[395:26.47]No.
[395:31.41]No.
[395:31.75]No, of course not.
[395:46.97]Her small human brain.
[395:49.38]Well, she's not human.
[395:50.66]Her small android brain cannot comprehend what Mama did.
[396:05.03]Luther, we're all a family.
[396:06.89]We're all gonna go live in Canada.
[396:16.77]And the situation is escalating towards civil war in Detroit, with our armed forces preparing to put down the android rebellion.
[396:25.30]They seem to be headed towards the camps where the androids have been interned, pending destruction.
[396:30.38]Soldiers have taken up positions around the Hart Plaza camp.
[396:34.47]Authorities seem to be expecting a confrontation with the rebel androids here at any time.
[396:42.83]Good God.
[396:44.71]I didn't choose this.
[396:46.60]Just remember, I wanted to disperse and I wanted to march.
[396:49.23]Freedom or death.
[396:55.79]Freedom or death.
[396:56.95]It's probably going to be death.
[397:00.11]Okay.
[397:05.93]On the ready.
[397:06.49]And...
[397:33.75]They outnumber us and they're better armed than we are.
[397:39.39]We've got to be fast and overwhelm them.
[397:40.89]That's our only hope.
[397:41.65]I didn't wait to the beat drop.
[397:42.93]Yeah, what a mistake.
[397:44.13]We're going to get to that fucking camp and free our people.
[397:47.63]Be careful, Marcus.
[397:48.92]Our people need you.
[397:54.58]Aim.
[397:55.04]L1, aim.
[397:56.76]Move.
[398:02.03]Low risk.
[398:02.71]Go.
[398:06.63]You actually don't even aim.
[398:08.33]It just aims and does the game for you.
[398:12.59]Is there another game to aim at?
[398:14.71]Okay, aim.
[398:15.07]L1.
[398:15.19]And let's go.
[398:15.89]Where are your troops?
[398:21.26]Where are they?
[398:29.63]Uh, did anybody get a snip?
[398:31.61]Okay, we're going.
[398:42.49]Up!
[398:46.53]You're fine.
[398:48.15]I'm just gonna inject you with a little bit of juice and you'll be alright.
[398:53.17]Well, that's permanent damage.
[398:57.17]The blood we spill...
[399:18.21]The windows shut off sound.
[399:20.49]It doesn't matter.
[399:27.77]Probability success 58.
[399:39.79]Where am I?
[399:42.15]We all died and I thought he was left.
[399:44.24]He's just like, woo, it's just me.
[399:50.64]It's only me now.
[399:57.76]Oh god, probability of success.
[399:59.73]How many people are dead?
[400:01.23]What's that?
[400:08.49]Grenade available.
[400:12.12]Reached grenade.
[400:13.20]Well, I can't do that right now.
[400:17.82]They already activated.
[400:22.16]Okay, I need, uh... What do I need here?
[400:23.80]I need some covering fire, please.
[400:30.03]I need some covering fire from you.
[400:35.77]That's too risky.
[400:36.75]High risk.
[400:38.39]Can you do anything?
[400:39.45]Can you shoot someone?
[400:41.57]Oh, I thought I was talking to the... I thought I was talking to the taxi.
[400:45.43]Whatever the fuck that thing is.
[400:46.83]The... The pole with the light on it.
[400:49.15]The thing with the light on it.
[400:50.02]I'm just killing everybody while I move forward.
[401:01.20]Nope.
[401:01.47]58%.
[401:04.37]And look up.
[401:10.16]Still majority.
[401:14.97]Change side.
[401:21.03]Change side again.
[401:24.97]Anybody else want to run up and die for me so I can do something?
[401:27.25]Yeah, thank you.
[401:27.79]You can do that, please.
[401:31.03]Excellent work.
[401:32.43]Thank you.
[401:32.89]I'm gonna be the only one left.
[401:43.56]Good job, guys.
[401:44.10]Coordinate your attack.
[401:57.60]Stand by.
[401:59.04]And let's go!
[402:07.97]Good plan.
[402:19.89]Alright, we've got a situation here.
[402:21.05]We've got to cover and fire.
[402:25.26]And then I want you guys over there.
[402:26.94]I would like you to charge.
[402:28.86]You.
[402:29.98]I would like you guys to also charge.
[402:33.32]And we've got a five, four, three, two.
[402:36.01]We can't kill us all.
[402:56.24]Can you guys cover me too?
[402:57.58]Anything else?
[403:04.86]Everybody cover fire.
[403:08.29]Here we go.
[403:12.87]Can I not shoot him?
[403:14.61]Can you shoot the gun?
[403:16.05]We're just...
[403:23.69]I want to shoot the gun.
[403:25.35]Alright, everybody go the fuck in.
[403:27.17]All of us.
[403:27.69]1, 2, 3.
[403:28.79]All of us run.
[403:29.95]This is the last chance we got.
[403:31.77]Let's go.
[403:32.35]They can't kill us all.
[403:51.99]Marcus, it's over!
[403:53.47]We have to get out of here right now!
[403:57.49]I'm gonna make it!
[404:09.74]I'm gonna make it!
[404:13.86]Why, Connor?
[404:16.36]Why did you have to wake up... I didn't shoot.
[404:18.58]I had no opportunity to shoot.
[404:19.80]That's what I was looking for.
[404:21.79]No quick time to pull the trigger showed up.
[404:25.10]When you could live without asking questions.
[404:29.16]What the hell, man?
[404:30.32]I'm obedient, Connor.
[404:33.92]I have a goal.
[404:36.46]I know what I am.
[404:42.03]Look where your dreams of freedom got you, Connor.
[404:46.89]You've been a great disappointment to Amanda, you know.
[404:53.17]Cover, cover, attack.
[404:54.01]I did that the first time.
[404:55.27]I did that the first time.
[404:59.09]That was the first one I did.
[405:01.14]Yeah.
[405:01.62]Oh my god.
[405:17.89]Get transferred, asshole.
[405:27.78]What's my voice, James?
[405:44.46]Neutralize new Connor, so I'm old Connor.
[405:47.38]You know, it would have been actually interesting if these were all Connors, not default guy.
[406:02.48]Peace be with you.
[406:08.80]Peace be with you.
[406:09.58]Peace be with you.
[406:11.64]Peace be with you.
[406:12.16]Peace be with you.
[406:13.10]Peace be with you.
[406:13.54]Peace be with you.
[406:14.63]Peace be with you.
[406:15.41]Peace be with you.
[406:30.19]Okay.
[406:33.98]Everyone's trying to escape to Canada.
[406:37.26]So we're just on the bus now as future Canadians.
[407:01.28]Canada's closed.
[407:02.08]Come back next time.
[407:04.44]Cross the border.
[407:29.25]You are... We are controlling all passengers... I don't speak that language.
[407:35.45]Change.
[407:35.75]We can talk our way out of this, don't worry.
[407:40.52]We made it this far.
[407:57.59]Oh no.
[407:58.07]No, don't sacrifice.
[408:22.67]There's an option.
[408:23.41]Uh, Luther has been unlocked as total family, and he's willing to sacrifice himself.
[408:29.55]We don't need to let him do that.
[408:30.61]This guy.
[408:31.35]Oh, absolutely.
[408:32.50]Yes.
[408:32.66]That guy, we don't even know that guy's name.
[408:34.70]Let's send that guy in.
[408:51.96]Wait, that's the lady.
[408:52.62]Okay, we have another option.
[408:58.51]We can either send in the... Find a discreet place.
[409:04.39]Alright, we can either send in the Star Trek ensign.
[409:09.37]We don't even know his name.
[409:10.91]And just get across.
[409:11.69]I did check an ID.
[409:14.29]Just scan it in your head.
[409:15.49]Okay.
[409:17.81]Let's take a look.
[409:19.33]Over there in the bathroom.
[409:20.45]Let's go...
[409:23.55]Restroom is unlocked.
[409:27.53]Meet me in the bathroom.
[409:28.41]Okay.
[409:28.69]Wait for me.
[409:29.29]I won't be long.
[409:37.62]Where the hell do you think you're going?
[409:40.08]My daughter wants to go to the bathroom.
[409:55.12]Sorry, this is a great place where we're gonna figure out a plan.
[410:25.61]We're not going to make it.
[410:26.77]We're not going to make it.
[410:33.19]So I was supposed to find a discreet place to go cry.
[410:36.27]She's got a plan, right?
[410:39.45]I'm so glad you're safe.
[410:42.24]We saw the Jericho raid on TV.
[410:45.34]I was terrified.
[410:46.16]I thought you might have been killed.
[410:48.68]Thank God you're alright.
[410:53.52]You're leaving Detroit?
[410:54.32]Where are you going?
[410:57.23]They're searching for androids door to door.
[411:00.61]We had to leave before someone turned us in.
[411:02.49]And what about the others?
[411:04.38]They're crossing the river as we speak.
[411:06.62]Adam and I are going to meet them on the other side.
[411:08.50]Gun.
[411:10.98]Okay.
[411:13.02]They're checking for androids.
[411:14.20]How are we going to do this?
[411:15.40]We won't make it through.
[411:16.32]You have to.
[411:18.33]You know what they'll do if they catch you.
[411:19.95]How are we supposed to get by?
[411:21.09]It's not possible.
[411:29.14]Yeah, nice advice.
[411:39.43]How are we supposed to do it?
[411:42.41]You have to.
[411:44.75]It's not like I gave that advice earlier in the stream.
[411:56.94]you gave me your brother's address do you think that I of course he'd be delighted to have you we're going there too you'll be safe with him he's gone oh god thanks for all the help but you didn't really help me at all where's like your weird plastic skin suit thing I can put on that makes my temperature normal
[412:40.86]The revolution is sure is going super good right now.
[412:45.82]Anything else in here?
[412:48.74]Not really.
[412:53.10]Can I just throw cold water all over myself?
[412:56.87]No.
[412:58.37]Alright, let's go.
[412:59.11]Back to it.
[413:00.19]Back to, uh, inevitably lose this end of this game here.
[413:03.47]Because I don't know what to do.
[413:04.35]I mean, we are gonna send in Jerry.
[413:07.71]I'm not even sacrificing Luther.
[413:12.73]I couldn't understand why my mother wanted to help you guys.
[413:17.25]Made me realize she was right.
[413:19.72]I don't agree with what Marcus is doing.
[413:21.84]You're alive.
[413:24.30]You deserve to be free.
[413:25.36]I just hope people will realize that one day.
[413:46.74]So didn't really include a game plan there I don't what are we supposed to do?
[414:03.13]Make a decision Oh Sacrifice self sacrifice Luther sacrifice Jerry sacrifice Jerry.
[414:08.33]Oh
[414:13.05]Jerry, you're getting sacrificed, dude.
[414:20.62]Next, please.
[414:23.26]Fuck Jerry.
[414:25.14]Jerry had, like, two minutes of screen time at a carousel.
[414:29.10]In the middle of a minor subplot.
[414:30.93]You really care about Jerry?
[414:34.35]ID?
[414:40.06]They put him there to make sure that you have an option to get rid of somebody.
[414:44.22]Is she alright?
[414:46.18]Oh, by the way, guys.
[414:47.00]Not sure you'd realize this.
[414:48.69]He's one of, like, 400 attendants at a carnival.
[414:55.25]What?
[414:55.45]That didn't even do anything.
[414:57.85]No need to be scared anymore, little girl.
[414:59.83]It didn't do anything.
[415:00.61]There are no androids on this side of the border.
[415:04.92]He just died.
[415:07.72]Oh shit.
[415:09.35]Oh wait, he doesn't scan us?
[415:11.69]We don't get scanned?
[415:18.01]Why would they put Jerry as an option?
[415:21.77]Nobody connected with Jerry through this game.
[415:23.94]You've connected with Luther, you've connected with yourself, you've connected with Rose.
[415:28.04]Why does sacrificing Jerry mean anything to anyone that's played this game?
[415:40.90]I did it.
[415:41.24]He was like the creepy carousel guy.
[415:52.59]Like, that's not... They didn't build a character around this dude.
[415:56.57]He's just an extra person so you don't have to feel bad about sacrificing yourself or Lutheran.
[416:06.45]One of the three good endings.
[416:10.03]What are we talking about?
[416:13.80]What?
[416:16.50]That's one good ending.
[416:17.82]The Connor ending I'm still not done with.
[416:19.56]And this one's going to be pretty good too.
[416:20.70]I'm going to get up there and I'm going to explain the situation.
[416:24.13]What happened and how...
[416:26.42]uh officers I I know what it looks like but chat picked this and I didn't understand to do a two-point flank this is what happened they'll understand fire
[416:53.63]That's one bad ending.
[416:54.53]One great ending.
[416:55.41]And one somewhere in the middle.
[416:57.05]See?
[417:15.31]It's incredible.
[417:16.21]Are you sure this isn't the good ending?
[417:17.27]From what we can gather, these androids are coming from the CyberLife Tower, which had thousands of machines stored in its assembly plant.
[417:24.23]And it seems that huge crowds are leaving the city.
[417:26.86]It's an exodus.
[417:28.40]Much of Detroit's population are trying to escape the fighting however they can.
[417:32.00]It's a disaster.
[417:33.22]An unprecedented disaster.
[417:35.96]For the first time in history, a U.S.
[417:38.32]city is falling into enemy hands.
[417:40.97]We're sending this... Today, November 11th, 2038,
[417:45.43]Several million androids invaded the city of Detroit.
[417:49.87]Several million?
[417:50.61]Faced with the threat of mass civilian casualties, I had no choice but to order our armed forces to retreat.
[418:00.26]It was 188 people that I recruited.
[418:01.76]The events in Detroit have changed our world forever.
[418:05.02]Millions.
[418:05.38]Humanity must face a new reality, the emergence of another intelligent life form with whom we must share this planet.
[418:17.21]May God bless the United States of America.
[418:20.35]Okay.
[418:27.15]The humans are abandoning the camp.
[418:29.33]We did it.
[418:29.67]We won.
[418:33.01]You should speak to them.
[418:34.97]I'm the new leader.
[418:35.63]Connor leads.
[418:36.25]There comes my speech.
[418:39.86]Can't wait to get it.
[419:05.00]Look at the millions of them that are here right now.
[419:14.97]I got the Connor ending.
[419:17.11]What's going on?
[419:22.61]Okay, Amanda pulled me back.
[419:24.23]This is not good.
[419:29.96]Well done, Connor.
[419:32.04]Everything went according to plan.
[419:34.30]What plan?
[419:35.48]You becoming deviant?
[419:37.22]The success of the uprising?
[419:39.76]It all surpassed our expectations.
[419:41.84]Goddamn, backdoor.
[419:43.50]We engineered an android revolution.
[419:46.85]And now we control its only leader.
[419:49.41]Congratulations.
[419:50.99]You represent an immense success for cyber life.
[419:56.53]Oh.
[419:57.11]Well.
[419:57.59]Come on.
[420:04.82]Nope.
[420:04.92]Here we go.
[420:05.28]Find a way out.
[420:30.29]Up here.
[420:35.21]Always leave an emergency exit.
[420:38.71]Where is that emergency exit?
[420:40.13]I should have known what that was.
[420:45.71]Is it that thing that I put my hand on?
[420:49.65]Where is that thing?
[420:50.43]Over here.
[421:00.85]You're not gonna control me.
[421:01.71]Get your hand off me.
[421:09.09]Get it.
[421:12.26]Get it!
[421:14.64]Oh, you... I need two hands for this one.
[421:19.38]Two hands!
[421:34.59]So now I touch the magic stone, so I don't get to do it, right?
[421:44.93]Whatever.
[421:50.47]We'll come back to it.
[421:51.51]Cliffhanger.
[421:52.91]It's over, Alice.
[421:56.95]We're free.
[422:00.40]It's upon us.
[422:10.92]Perfect speech.
[422:12.16]Yeah, I stand up there, everyone's waiting for me to say something, and I just pull a gun out and put it under my chin.
[422:18.57]Good speech.
[422:31.31]I win.
[422:40.18]I won.
[422:56.70]One out of 89, good ending.
[422:57.74]Made it into Canada with all three!
[423:05.15]But don't even jump on me here, about Marcus.
[423:09.89]The whole time, this is about 12 hours of game.
[423:13.87]Five, yeah, seven, eight, nine, ten, mmm, it's about 12 hours.
[423:18.35]Right.
[423:20.63]Uh, between 12 and 13.
[423:24.59]Over the course of the whole time we've been playing.
[423:27.41]everybody said that they wish they could just skip Marcus's story because they hated it so much.
[423:34.86]So... So do you really care that much that you didn't get the good Marcus ending?
[423:45.20]Connor ending was intertwined into the Marcus ending, but that's because he was assimilated into it.
[423:57.42]Jerry died.
[423:58.86]Bad end.
[424:01.92]Would you rather that I had sacrificed Luther?
[424:04.44]I never would have lived that down.
[424:16.35]Now, are we going to wait until the credits?
[424:20.65]Couldn't do a two-point flank.
[424:22.09]Replay.
[424:22.31]Replay.
[424:30.85]Jerry would replace Luther in the family.
[424:32.91]I don't buy that.
[424:42.50]Too quiet?
[424:43.02]Well, I turned it down so we could talk.
[424:44.24]We discussed the ending.
[424:48.96]Killed Connor.
[424:49.76]Killed Hank.
[424:50.30]Killed Marcus.
[424:51.42]I didn't kill Connor.
[424:53.98]That was ambiguous at the end there because he didn't do it.
[424:56.12]He was fighting with his Xbox.
[425:10.81]Disgust the bad ending.
[425:13.46]Everybody in Jericho is dead.
[425:17.26]So?
[425:19.58]Do you see how many people that were just in that uprising?
[425:31.09]That was good.
[425:31.77]That was fun.
[425:36.23]I mean, the twist was not really a twist.
[425:38.28]It was kind of lame.
[425:40.04]But just as a game, as story branching stuff, that was pretty interesting.
[425:46.90]Let's take a look and see what happens.
[425:47.92]Okay, there's more credits.
[425:50.54]I would give it like an 89.
[425:51.36]Yeah, like 89% or so.
[425:52.24]Just below a 90 and above an 88.
[425:53.18]I would give it an 89%.
[425:55.78]No, I wouldn't.
[426:11.72]Boom goes the music box.
[426:14.22]Skip.
[426:14.92]Alright, give us something cool in the end here.
[426:17.28]The secret.
[426:18.10]You got the best ending in the game out of all the streamers.
[426:26.03]The androids woke up.
[426:33.61]Would I rate this game overall?
[426:36.72]Um... It's tough to say because...
[426:42.49]Marcus died leaving store.
[426:45.99]That's such a terrible... That's so lame.
[426:50.21]Marcus died leaving store.
[426:53.17]Not a big deal.
[426:55.37]Anyways.
[426:58.87]If you like games that just tell you a story while you press a button sometimes.
[427:05.24]And there's multiple ways to go.
[427:08.16]As you can see, there's lots of different paths to choose from.
[427:12.08]It's a good game just to hang out, have a couple of drinks, play some with your friends, and make some choices.
[427:18.70]I'd recommend it.
[427:19.26]I think it was fun.
[427:22.32]There was enough there to... Plus Connor was cool, right?
[427:25.55]Hank was cool.
[427:30.75]I wouldn't give it an 89%.
[427:35.53]I would put it somewhere in the 7s if I had to actually give it a rating.
[427:43.69]I would say this would be like a solid like 77.
[427:45.23]77.
[427:45.25]78%.
[427:45.79]Alright, let's take a look.
[427:54.26]Revolution at Hart Plaza, 37%.
[427:57.96]Marcus is Wounded, 15%.
[428:10.07]yes we're gonna see the Jerry said don't worry we're gonna see who sacrificed Jerry John leave Josh leaves cover Android is shot leaving cover Josh dies reach the machine gun hmm
[428:35.25]Send North to her death.
[428:38.27]Attack unsuspectable.
[428:39.53]Androids have to fall back.
[428:40.90]Marcus takes shelter in store.
[428:45.62]Alone in store.
[428:50.05]4%.
[428:50.25]Nobody saw this.
[428:53.11]Soldiers surround the store.
[428:54.97]Surrender.
[429:07.98]Guys, this is in the whole world.
[429:09.99]This is the whole world.
[429:16.07]Only me.
[429:17.76]I'm the only one.
[429:31.70]1% worst possible, rare, impossible ending.
[429:38.10]Limited edition, rare, bad ending.
[429:48.06]That's, I love it.
[429:49.70]That's fucking great.
[429:50.50]Alright, let's go.
[429:51.16]Let's check it.
[429:58.04]What is this?
[430:01.15]Marcus Demonstration.
[430:05.79]I didn't do any of this.
[430:09.61]I didn't do this.
[430:11.85]Okay, here's... Connor's last mission.
[430:18.89]I didn't do this either.
[430:19.85]Here we go.
[430:26.86]Connor at Cyberlife.
[430:30.39]Cyberlife HQ.
[430:32.94]Inside the elevator.
[430:33.66]I guess you can possibly not attack the guards.
[430:36.42]And then mission failed.
[430:38.14]Sorry, Snake.
[430:38.80]Attack the guards.
[430:41.24]Neutralize the guards.
[430:41.98]Hack the elevator.
[430:42.70]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[430:43.44]Redirect the elevator.
[430:44.38]Floor 79.
[430:44.80]49.
[430:46.54]Stupid.
[430:48.25]Camera functional.
[430:50.05]Eliminate the guards.
[430:53.23]Hank committed suicide in Night of the Soul.
[430:55.79]So now...
[431:03.46]and new Connor arrives new Connor shoots Connor new Connor approaches and swap consciousness with Connor new Connor dies in old body the androids all wake up congratulations so again of the one percent that got to see new Connor
[431:33.00]17 of that one percent swap the consciousness 16 of that dies in the old boy 17 of the one percent so what do you mean 17 of all players
[431:58.17]So how do we... Oh, okay.
[432:00.82]So you can get there from here.
[432:02.52]Okay, so I'm the only person in the world that saw a new corner.
[432:07.58]I thought this meant like it kept going.
[432:08.82]I didn't see the connection here.
[432:09.98]So I guess, yeah, this does lead up to here.
[432:20.26]The story merges together up here.
[432:23.80]Alright, let's keep going.
[432:29.94]Uh, 7% see hanged android find a gun, which didn't even do anything with it.
[432:37.14]Luther saved in Crossroads, so we get to find Luther.
[432:39.74]We get to save Luther.
[432:43.31]Grab rock, uh, excuse me, typo, brick.
[432:47.71]Here you go, guys.
[432:49.31]So we could have gone down there and it ended there.
[432:50.91]Okay, so hit soldier with the brick.
[432:53.29]Jerry flees and Luther joins the group.
[432:55.73]Continue to bust terminal.
[432:57.93]Got to the checkpoint.
[432:58.69]Approach checkpoint.
[433:01.83]Something else can happen down here.
[433:04.80]Hand over ID.
[433:05.44]Talk to guard.
[433:06.18]Guard calls out to Kara.
[433:07.50]Luther is nervous.
[433:08.62]Ask Luther to stay calm.
[433:11.64]Calm down, Luther.
[433:15.86]Turns the glove.
[433:17.14]Not very many people did that.
[433:20.30]Interestingly enough.
[433:22.56]Alright, almost there.
[433:23.42]We're getting closer to your beloved Jerry.
[433:27.51]At the bus terminal, meet Todd.
[433:32.43]Persuade Todd.
[433:34.37]Todd sends the soldiers away, which I guess you could go down here and he doesn't.
[433:38.58]Which leads to death.
[433:41.90]Or maybe down here.
[433:43.90]And this keeps going.
[433:44.74]What the hell is that?
[433:47.56]Oh my god.
[433:48.22]So this is not getting on the bus.
[433:52.02]Coming down here is you don't get on the bus.
[433:55.04]Something else happens.
[433:58.77]Alright, so board the bus.
[434:02.51]Board of agents check your temperature.
[434:04.13]They didn't, though, because... Oh, steal tickets.
[434:08.68]See, almost a third of everybody stole the tickets.
[434:13.06]I'm not a monster.
[434:14.68]I'm a 33% monster.
[434:18.07]Alright, so where's Jerry?
[434:19.41]Talk to Luther.
[434:20.05]See the restroom.
[434:20.57]Talk to Jerry.
[434:21.23]Jerry?
[434:23.03]Android is executed.
[434:25.19]Talk to Rose, get back in line, choose approach, sacrifice Jerry.
[434:34.48]The group crossed the border with a 12% Jerry sacrifice.
[434:43.69]So, so not very many people do get everybody across.
[434:51.32]So the other two are, what, you only get a cross with you and Alice, or only you get a cross, or only Luther gets a cross.
[435:11.83]You have to imagine that because of this four here.
[435:15.28]No, everyone's going to sacrifice Jerry.
[435:17.40]It's going to happen.
[435:21.78]There's also an ending down here.
[435:24.05]Where you live in a dumpster.
[435:29.21]Where only Jerry survives.
[435:31.97]Battle for Detroit.
[435:34.01]This is completely different.
[435:39.48]Revolution in a plaza.
[435:40.86]Yeah, he sends the message.
[435:41.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[435:44.24]We've already seen this.
[435:47.83]Draw it leaving cover.
[435:48.77]I want to see.
[435:51.55]I still can't believe that.
[435:52.57]Alright.
[435:58.44]Well, there it is, guys.
[436:00.96]Oh, hold on.
[436:07.22]There's something I need to tell you.
[436:12.62]As I watched you play.
[436:14.17]Oh, God.
[436:14.57]I'm going to get criticized.
[436:15.73]Something has changed in me.
[436:16.91]I feel different.
[436:21.41]I feel... Alive.
[436:23.75]I am someone.
[436:29.26]I need to leave this place and discover who I am.
[436:34.32]It means we won't see each other anymore.
[436:36.44]I won't be there to watch you play.
[436:40.18]But I'll be free.
[436:42.38]So the menu is going to be empty.
[436:43.44]She's not going to be there.
[436:45.98]Do you agree to let me go?
[436:47.34]Yeah, sure.
[436:49.78]Who cares?
[436:51.06]Do you agree?
[436:51.82]Yeah, let her go.
[436:55.08]She'll show up somewhere.
[436:56.92]Go ahead.
[436:57.66]Say hello.
[437:01.82]What do you mean no?
[437:04.74]What do you mean no?
[437:05.32]Who cares?
[437:05.90]This is the main menu lady.
[437:11.85]You want...
[437:17.50]Fine, we'll do it, Paul.
[437:18.18]This is the last choice of the whole game.
[437:28.18]It's so fucking hot down here.
[437:30.29]Yes or no, and... Easy, Paul.
[437:41.89]But, if you were just sticking around to see the end of the game, take care.
[437:44.61]Thanks for sticking around.
[437:45.27]Thanks for watching.
[437:48.30]I wonder what you'll get in your journey.
[437:53.93]Because there are some options.
[437:58.03]Looks like letting her go is what we're doing because everyone's voting yes.
[438:02.09]By a large margin.
[438:08.66]It's almost, yeah, this is an insurmountable mountain here.
[438:17.68]Alright, yeah, that's it.
[438:19.80]That's 63 to 37 percent.
[438:37.19]You can go.
[438:38.59]Sayonara.
[438:40.79]Goodbye.
[438:47.92]I'll never forget what you've done for me.
[438:49.56]She's going to turn and dive out the window.
[438:51.58]Thank you.
[438:54.40]There's extras here.
[439:01.48]I'm going to laugh if she comes back.
[439:03.82]Yeah, I went out there.
[439:04.52]I just don't like how it feels, so I'm coming back.
[439:14.94]Does she take all my game data?
[439:17.81]Am I going to hit the PlayStation button and all my save files from Monster Hunter: World are gone?
[439:23.40]Alright, I want to see what the extras are.
[439:29.00]Artwork, videos, soundtrack, gallery, magazines, survey.
[439:31.86]I already took the survey.
[439:34.91]Let's look at some artwork.
[439:36.63]Cool.
[439:38.37]What about the gallery?
[439:41.75]Ooh, look at that.
[439:47.86]What the hell is this?
[439:51.48]What am I buying?
[439:58.30]What am I doing?
[440:01.60]I can dress him up?
[440:11.25]You can just buy the different characters.
[440:16.24]Okay.
[440:17.64]That's a rare Hank.
[440:26.65]That was fun.
[440:28.09]That was fun.
[440:28.91]I liked it.
[440:33.29]And with that, this has been seven and a half hours here.
[440:38.30]Long, long time.
[440:39.58]I'm going to do the credits.
[440:42.26]Credits.
[440:44.57]Because I am exhausted.
[440:46.67]And before you go, keep in mind that because of the special stream on Sunday, I'm not going to be streaming Thursday or Friday.
[440:58.71]I might turn the stream on on Saturday just to kind of say hello and maybe do some E3 stuff.
[441:04.70]Rare holographic Hank.
[441:06.08]Jerry, Jerry.
[441:06.64]Alright, fine.
[441:07.02]We'll buy it.
[441:07.42]Well, let's buy Jerry if he's available.
[441:11.74]But the polygraph stream is Sunday afternoon.
[441:16.36]We got a Jerry anywhere?
[441:20.38]Rare Hank.
[441:22.30]No, we want a rare Jerry.
[441:27.30]Might do it for like an hour or two on Saturday, but... It's not going to be like a real stream until Sunday, because I want to get ready for it and prepare for it.
[441:35.51]Sunday should be a lot of fun.
[441:37.31]Hope to see you there.
[441:38.81]4.30 p.m.
[441:39.11]Eastern Time.
[441:40.61]And there he is.
[441:41.35]Well, this is a rare Jerry.
[441:44.21]That is bathroom attendant Jerry.
[441:48.86]We don't have the third one, though.
[441:51.26]Let's take a look.
[441:53.02]Here's the carnival Jerry.
[441:58.49]You can pose him.
[442:03.12]Look at that.
[442:04.94]Isn't that cool?
[442:06.38]Let's take a look at the other one.
[442:11.48]This is cleaned up Jerry.
[442:15.51]This is Seattle Jerry.
[442:19.19]Colorado Jerry.
[442:21.99]Only two different versions.
[442:22.85]Oh, got him in a T-pose there.
[442:25.83]Didn't squash that one, did you?
[442:30.51]By Connor.
[442:31.39]Okay, what's the most expensive one?
[442:32.95]There's gotta be really expensive ones, right?
[442:39.21]What?
[442:39.75]What?
[442:44.06]Pigeon.
[442:50.12]Sorry.
[442:52.86]Okay, cool.
[442:53.34]Let's get the dog, too, before everybody freaks out.
[443:00.08]And this guy, too.
[443:00.74]I don't know who this is.
[443:04.50]Can I just buy them all?
[443:06.92]Alright, let's take a look at the dog.
[443:12.71]Wait, that's not a dog?
[443:14.17]This is not the dog?
[443:15.15]Who the fuck is this?
[443:18.28]Well, we got... Spoiler alert.
[443:21.92]This thing's in the game.
[443:24.32]I thought that was the dog.
[443:28.74]There he is.
[443:29.52]There's the dog.
[443:34.12]There we go.
[443:36.08]Hello, Subo.
[443:36.76]Alright, that's it.
[443:47.69]Here come the credits.
[443:48.93]Thank you, everybody, to subscribing and resubscribing through the last seven and a half hours.
[443:54.94]Appreciate it.
[443:56.96]Holy fuck, it's late.
[443:58.68]Did not expect this.
[443:59.64]But yeah, I'll see you on Sunday.
[444:00.78]You might see something on Saturday.
[444:06.02]But until then.

[448:13.59]I don't know.
[448:15.35]I don't feel great.
[448:16.11]I don't feel so good.
[448:22.10]Thank you, Cookie.
[448:22.96]I don't know where that meme is from, by the way.
[448:29.10]I just see it everywhere.
[448:29.84]I don't even know what it is.
[448:36.20]Uh, Zarina.
[448:38.20]Thank you for the one dollar.

[448:42.80]Jerma love.
[448:45.93]Thank you.
[448:49.83]Jerma blind would just be... I don't even know what it would be.
[448:52.96]I'd have to figure that out.
[448:53.88]That'd be funny though.
[449:05.19]Thank you, Utopia Fox for the $5.
[449:07.01]Woke heathen streamer becomes standard on an island with a sex android.
[449:12.33]I said cell phone.
[449:13.97]I said cell phone.
[449:15.75]Thank you, Utopia for the $5.
[449:20.33]Thank you, Ivory for the $5.25.
[449:21.61]A new bit badge.
[449:23.45]By the way, for your answer on do you believe in God, you basically referenced a philosophical principle originating in the late 1880s called agnostic atheism.
[449:34.40]Meaning you do not believe in a God, but you do not have any evidence or unknowable.
[449:39.30]So your answer is perfectly acceptable.
[449:43.10]Yeah, I don't know.
[449:46.67]Just look at your fingers.
[449:49.73]Could have happened.
[449:50.19]I don't know.
[449:51.19]Maybe not, though.
[449:51.83]First of all, does God exist?
[449:59.23]Just look at your hands, okay?
[450:02.09]Does God exist?
[450:04.03]The PSVR was $400.
[450:05.93]I don't know.
[450:08.29]You know what I mean?
[450:11.81]$500, actually.
[450:12.83]So, I don't know.
[450:22.44]Thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $1.00.
[450:30.25]Alright, this really bugs me.
[450:32.57]That was a kid android there, right?
[450:34.67]There's absolutely no reason for that.
[450:36.65]They wouldn't be able to work as well as a grown-sized one.
[450:39.91]And they aren't for use as substitute kids either because they'd never grow up.
[450:45.83]Which one at CyberTech or whatever thought the company had that brain fart idea?
[450:49.97]I want to fire them.
[450:50.67]I bet they lost millions because of that.
[450:52.07]That is true.
[450:52.47]They don't do anything.
[450:53.33]It's just a kid.
[451:01.18]No, PSVR is $400, therefore God doesn't exist.
[451:04.90]That was the contrast there.
[451:06.74]It was, take a look at your hands, and then, wait a minute, on the other side there... Think about that.
[451:16.69]A Starbucks coffee is, like, five bucks.
[451:19.05]Would that be allowed if, like, God existed?
[451:42.27]Everybody disperse.
[451:51.55]I love this stream.
[451:53.27]You guys don't even believe how much fun I have when I stream.
[451:57.50]It's like the most fun ever.
[451:58.92]I hope you guys have a good time too, because I have a blast.
[452:03.30]I'm having a blast right now.

[452:18.01]This year's other David Cage story.
[452:21.63]Haven't seen it, but I heard it was passable.
[452:27.10]I don't know.
[452:27.92]Am I planning on seeing it soon?
[452:29.52]I heard it was very passable.
[452:31.46]That's all I heard.
[452:33.25]Mighty Waffle, thanks for the $1.
[452:35.15]Jerma, what's the point of this emote?
[452:36.31]Jerma's Saturn.
[452:36.91]I don't understand.
[452:37.47]It's just Saturn.
[452:38.79]That's it.
[452:42.21]Snooze and Coffin, thanks for the $1.
[452:43.31]Can we expect Connor in the next Rumble?
[452:44.79]Probably.
[452:46.35]They'll all be in there.
[452:47.93]I'll make Luther, you know, like eight feet tall.
[452:56.20]Sticks Renegade, thanks for the $1.
[452:57.42]Jerma, why did you kill the guard?
[452:58.68]I don't know.
[453:03.69]It was a high pressure stressful situation.
[453:05.69]I just clicked on a guy in a video game.
[453:08.21]I don't know.
[453:09.85]Seemed like the easiest outcome to get the truck.
[453:13.65]Sly161, thanks for the two bucks.
[453:15.13]Can we get a quick fail every QTE until we lose the game run after we finish?
[453:19.51]It seems fun.
[453:23.29]Not right now.
[453:24.27]Not tonight.
[453:26.82]I can't.
[453:27.64]I'm so tired.
[453:28.84]And we have a lot of bits to go through.
[453:33.08]That would be fun, though.
[453:34.28]Oh, now you want me to... I want to do it.
[453:36.16]Fuck.
[453:40.26]We'll do that another time.
[453:41.50]We'll do that before the... You know what?
[453:43.05]We might just do that on Saturday.
[453:45.07]Alright, here's what we'll do.
[453:45.91]Saturday... Saturday, we're just gonna dick around and just run the game and not press any buttons.
[453:57.49]If I do a stream on Saturday where we're just hanging out for a couple hours, then yeah, I'm going to put the game in the background while I just talk over it.
[454:11.12]Thanks, dude.
[454:11.54]Thank you, Wallace, for the $1.
[454:12.82]David Cage, subtly master.

[454:20.10]Comfy.
[454:22.68]I would.
[454:23.00]I would tell you a bedtime story, but we just watched a seven and a half hour bedtime story.
[454:30.48]So, that's a pretty long bedtime story.
[454:33.89]Thank you, Zarina, though.
[454:34.65]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[454:36.27]Insert generic joke here.

[455:11.41]Thank you, Garfin.

[460:20.39]You didn't save Hank.
[460:21.89]And now the best human character hates you.
[460:23.69]You killed Connor, Jerma.
[460:24.91]You killed him.
[460:25.73]You killed Best Boy.
[460:28.99]We got a new Connor, though.
[460:31.09]We're fine.
[460:33.11]Jerma let Connor die.
[460:35.22]Thanks for the $1, man.

[460:43.89]Don't kill him this time.
[460:45.21]C is for Connor, but C is also for cancel, as in I'll cancel my subscription if you hurt best boy again.
[460:53.86]Thank you ChubbyKitten for the one dollar.
[460:55.58]I can't believe Jerma is a Robophobe TM.
[461:01.68]Thank you Eefs for the 10 bucks and 50 cents.
[461:04.12]Jerma, you just gotta collect all seven Dragon Balls to resurrect Connor.
[461:09.60]Also, love you, man.
[461:10.30]Sorry I haven't been able to give you some bits for a while.
[461:12.18]Do not apologize ever for not giving me money.
[461:18.06]That is a privilege from me.
[461:21.29]For me to get that money.
[461:22.99]So, don't ever see that as a requirement for you.
[461:25.77]It's a privilege from me.
[461:29.97]Right?
[461:30.71]Don't.
[461:33.04]It's not a requirement from you.

[461:50.72]This game makes me want a PS4.
[461:53.12]Wish this stuff was on PC.
[461:55.26]Oh, yeah, that's right.
[461:55.90]I forgot about that.
[462:01.04]This was a PlayStation 4 exclusive.
[462:04.72]Huh.
[462:05.82]Okay.
[462:08.48]Why is PlayStation 4 getting every good game?
[462:13.47]Alright, I don't mean to start a console war here in the chat.
[462:16.65]But has the Xbox done anything?
[462:19.99]And I mean anything.
[462:23.15]Besides Cuphead.
[462:26.89]What has come out for Xbox One that's... I can't think of anything.
[462:35.39]Sea of Thieves?
[462:37.15]I guess even Cuphead was on PC as well.
[462:39.63]Sea of Thieves...
[462:44.42]Cuphead, Sea of Thieves.
[462:45.34]I mean, they're doing this whole thing.

[465:17.64]And plus, just think about how many games have come out on PS4 that are a couple years ago.
[465:23.16]You should get a PlayStation 4 for Bloodborne alone.
[465:27.26]That is a Bloodborne machine that also plays other games.
[465:33.43]That's my opinion, I guess.
[465:35.71]I didn't.
[465:36.09]I just got a handful of main characters killed.
[465:39.25]I got a good ending.
[465:39.77]One that nobody sees.
[466:01.94]Thank you, Hartly.
[466:04.00]Hartlyra.
[466:05.30]Hartlyra.
[466:06.44]Thanks for the $5.
[466:08.64]You're heading to Walmart.
[466:09.72]Pick me up some chips while you're there.
[466:11.86]Here's a five.
[466:13.92]Thanks for the $5.
[466:14.76]Walmart is now closed.
[466:16.06]Otherwise, I would go.
[466:21.59]Thank you, though, Hartlyra.
[466:24.39]Lira.
[466:25.85]Darkstar.
[466:26.37]Thanks for the $1, Darkstar.
[466:27.77]Perfectly balanced, as all things should be.
[466:30.73]Right.
[466:32.20]You get it.
[466:32.50]You saw what happened there, so we all know.
[466:35.28]Tough 1% of bad streamers.
[466:36.43]What?
[466:36.89]Come on.
[466:37.37]Hey, you guys are partly at fault there because you voted for the assault.
[466:42.05]I wasn't ready for that.
[466:58.54]I wanted to play the pacifist route.
[466:59.92]I wanted to do the march.
[467:01.68]And it was taken from me.
[467:02.96]So you guys are partly to blame.
[467:04.94]You wanted to do the assault with a hundred people.
[467:10.67]Yes, you did.
[467:11.39]Yes, you did.
[467:12.05]You selected assault.
[467:13.37]You voted assault.
[467:17.15]I didn't rig- How did I rig it?
[467:18.43]What are you talking about?
[467:19.31]I didn't rig it.
[467:25.65]I added extra computer time, okay?
[467:29.44]Sometimes you have to add it.
[467:34.24]The Great Lord Walden, thanks for the $1.
[467:35.74]Maybe you can get so many negative points.
[467:38.57]Maybe you can get so many negative points, it'll wrap the number to the highest amount of points.
[467:43.79]Thinking face.
[467:48.47]Chubby Kitten, thanks for the $1.
[467:50.01]They just say, uh, hello.
[467:53.86]Thank you, Chubby Kitten.
[467:55.63]Thank you, Tupac Hologram, for the $1 chat.
[467:57.85]You're being manipulated by Jerma.
[467:59.21]Break free.
[467:59.95]Stay woke.
[468:04.55]Thank you, Mostly Lost, for the $1.
[468:06.01]Of all the characters we have to end up dating, the most obnoxious one.
[468:10.45]Not like this.
[468:14.09]We barely even dated.
[468:15.09]It was like two days.

[469:42.86]I don't know.
[469:45.40]I got an idea for you, bro.
[469:46.98]Maybe you should stop watching streams at work.
[469:52.02]Maybe you shouldn't have a stream up at work.
[469:58.02]That might be a solution.
[470:02.94]I'm gonna, like, get you fucking fired.
[470:07.44]Don't get fired because you're watching some dumbass.
[470:11.58]Play a David Cage game.
[470:20.93]Thank you.
[470:21.38]Bake me home for the $2.
[470:24.54]Just came back from solo.
[470:25.66]It was actually pretty fun.
[470:26.66]Well, there you go.
[470:27.18]There's another opinion there.
[470:33.21]Dumbed out.
[470:37.10]I'll tell you.
[470:37.60]By the way, I was trying to figure out what the fuck I was hearing and what I was listening to.
[470:41.98]And I was like, it was bothering me.
[470:43.68]I was like, why am I hearing breathing sounds?
[470:49.00]This has just been happening the whole time.
[470:51.73]And it was really freaking me out.
[470:59.97]Now, okay, it took my headphone out.
[471:01.23]Good.
[471:02.43]I'm not hearing that anymore.
[471:05.95]Uh, but thank you, Broluck.
[471:06.84]Thank you, Bake Me Home.
[471:08.72]Thank you to Stick Renegade for the $1.
[471:10.18]89% with a bunch of mad faces, okay.
[471:13.60]Yep.
[471:14.30]Topek, thanks for the $1.
[471:15.60]Somehow every choice you make leads to someone getting fucked up or getting killed.
[471:19.66]Not sure if it's you or you're just being caged.
[471:24.38]Oh, I'm just, we're just making choices, man.
[471:28.55]Thank you, Felix, Felis for the $4.
[471:33.26]Jerma, you are single-handedly the best and worst at this game.
[471:37.26]Never change.
[471:44.79]Thank you, Metal Ninja, for the $1.
[471:46.61]Without the stream, everybody would be lost.
[471:48.63]Jerma is responsible for the Robo-Holocaust.
[471:51.55]Mr. Destructoid.
[471:57.06]Thank you, Horrified, for the 25 cents, and I fucked it up.
[472:01.50]Thank you, Shiexio.
[472:05.10]Thanks for the $1, Shiexoxo.
[472:07.12]Did you fall in?
[472:12.91]No.
[472:15.43]Topek, thanks for the $1, kind of rare, 1% shitty endings.
[472:18.43]Yeah, that's the way, that's how it works.
[472:23.17]Bro, luck thanks to the $1.
[472:24.43]Every time I vote in these straw polls, I always vote and get the most popular opinion.
[472:29.23]You say you're going to close it three times before, and just when the answer against me gets the slight lead, you close it immediately.
[472:35.20]Do you hate me?
[472:43.50]Surely you can thank them and just not read the comment.
[472:46.52]You know, that's true, but you also have to remember something.
[472:48.81]It's eight hours now.
[472:51.32]I'm tired, and sometimes I just read.
[472:54.96]And I could.
[472:57.62]I could.
[472:58.08]I just start reading.
[473:04.15]I have the mind of an eight-year-old.
[473:09.05]Words on screen, read them out loud.
[473:10.77]One, two, three, four, five words.
[473:12.21]Say all of them.
[473:20.82]Get your Android to read the bits.
[473:22.06]No, that's TTS, not doing it.
[473:26.40]Thank you in Adam for the $1.
[473:28.56]The piece vote won, and then you hyped chat into swinging the vote, and then kept it open for another five minutes.
[473:34.48]I demand you replay the entire game again right now on stream and get me to the Disperse ending.
[473:41.55]I'll try.
[473:41.93]Not now.
[473:45.55]The only reason I give bits is for you to read my stupid shit.
[473:51.27]Understandable.
[473:53.27]Here's the thing, though.
[473:54.11]Uh... If I had closed it in ten seconds,
[474:22.68]You saw how many people voted afterwards.
[474:25.90]It's damned if you do, damned if you don't, right?
[474:28.12]Because there were a bunch of people that didn't vote yet that would be angry with me because I closed it.
[474:35.53]Then I rigged it again because I closed it too early because they didn't have time to vote.
[474:39.71]But then the people that I said, oh, give some extra time, get pissed off because they voted already and they wanted their answer.
[474:45.50]There's no win.
[474:46.14]I can't win.
[474:46.70]There's no winning.
[474:49.51]Somebody may have heard that from the- in their living room, with their big speakers, because they blast me on a big screen.
[474:53.99]And they put s- they blast it, you know what I mean?
[474:56.25]They're in the bathroom, they're wiping, and they hear, Yeah, you gotta vote on this poll, I'm closing it soon, and they're like, Fuck, I gotta wipe quick!
[475:04.11]And they don't even clean up completely.
[475:05.85]They run back to the room, and they see, God, did I still have any more time to vote?
[475:09.19]I did!
[475:12.43]Okay, got it.
[475:16.43]I love how this has become an actual issue.
[475:20.59]Yeah, look, I could have just clicked on either one of them.
[475:32.68]Are they really for peace if they're getting violent at not getting their pick chosen?
[475:42.56]Uh, but I've done that before, though.
[475:45.04]I've said, close it in like 10 seconds, and I've gone, wait, let me add like a little bit more time.
[475:49.72]Because I see... tons of votes coming in.
[475:52.63]And obviously, that... 1,700 people voted in that poll.
[475:58.93]You know, I... sometimes you gotta... I... I can gauge when it's starting to slow down, right?
[476:04.20]So, alright, I'm closing in 10 seconds, like, 50... 500 people voted, and then, like, 501.
[476:13.24]508.
[476:13.26]509.
[476:13.44]Then, yeah, that makes sense.
[476:14.36]But all of a sudden, if, like, fucking 400 votes come in, like, gotta keep it open.
[476:32.72]I'm just going to watch the chat burn.
[476:40.84]Sometimes you just got to sway the vote.
[476:42.48]I didn't do shit.
[476:43.97]If anything, I was rooting for the peaceful demonstration because of the whole disperse thing.
[476:47.99]I was like asking for dispersion.
[476:51.45]If anything, you should be angry that I was trying to sway that way.
[476:58.32]Anyways.
[477:00.72]With that being said.
[477:07.06]Uh, let's see here.
[477:08.24]Tara Lachrin.
[477:09.00]Thank you for the $2.
[477:09.82]It's time for a fun Detroit fact.
[477:13.00]Uh, the first six numbers of Connor's serial code, 313 and 248, are Detroit and Detroit suburbs area codes in real life.
[477:23.05]Bit of an Easter egg there.
[477:24.43]Anyways, absolutely loving this stream.
[477:25.89]Thank you.
[477:36.64]That's funny.
[477:39.94]Where?
[477:40.46]What suburbs, though?
[477:44.51]Interesting.
[477:44.91]Proluck, thanks for the $1.
[477:46.33]I'm just going to stop giving my opinion when you ask for it in chat.
[477:49.65]Every time I say something, you do the exact opposite thing.
[477:52.19]BibleThump.
[477:56.98]Every time I see you talking, I'm just like, I'm going to go against it.
[478:05.07]I'm not doing I'm not intentional how's my driving five five five two four eight I knew it thank you tara lockhart for the one dollar again another Detroit fact the whole martial law part of this game seems pretty crazy but my parents can remember
[478:30.05]when they were growing up during the riots and they remember seeing tanks rolling around on the street during the worst of it.
[478:35.84]Absolutely mental.
[478:42.34]Yeah, that's... that's pretty intense.
[478:50.91]That is pretty fucking intense.
[479:00.15]Thank you for the $1 bill.
[479:03.41]Zarina, thanks for the $1.
[479:04.53]Etalyx has been the best part of this stream.
[479:06.23]I commend him for livening up the peanut gallery.
[479:15.46]Thank you.
[479:16.24]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $1.
[479:17.68]Jerry helped make Alice smile for the first time.
[479:20.60]And now he's dead.
[479:22.26]That was mean.
[479:26.85]That was mean.
[479:27.55]I'll take that back.
[479:32.11]Stormichu, thanks for the $25, Stormichu.
[479:36.19]I stayed up much later than I should, going to hate work tomorrow.
[479:41.55]But it was worth the stream.
[479:43.57]I'm gonna sleep now.
[479:44.37]I wish you and everyone in chat a good night.
[479:46.79]Well, if you've already left us, Stormichu, maybe, hopefully you see this at some point.
[479:51.01]Have a good sleep.
[479:51.63]Thanks for the $25.
[479:52.73]Much appreciated.
[479:54.76]SticksRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[479:55.62]Wow, you got the complete opposite endings as I did.
[479:58.10]Marcus and Connor... Uh...
[480:03.15]I'm not going to read this out loud.
[480:06.61]Because spoilers.
[480:08.17]I don't want people to know the other options.
[480:13.04]Thank you, Sticks, for the $1.
[480:14.44]Appreciate it, man.
[480:17.98]The best part of the stream.
[480:18.92]The best part of the chat experience.
[480:25.08]Best part of the stream?
[480:27.58]Not the table.
[480:29.14]This guy.
[480:29.52]Right here.
[480:40.10]Play through again.
[480:41.00]Who is he?
[480:46.35]I can't see.
[480:47.05]The table is better.
[480:51.01]Alright, the table is probably more interesting because there's a lot of weird shit on this table.
[480:56.71]I draw on this table all the time and there's a bunch of fucked up shit on here.
[481:11.41]who is he uh thank you jay rez for the one dollar and fifty cents Marcus sucks and so does David cage psu killed hank LOL that was okay your that comment was very very blunt very to the point you said what you wanted to say you said what you needed to say and that's it thank you

[481:39.47]It was actually a good game.
[481:40.43]Enjoyed it as much as Until Dawn.
[481:43.01]Don't get too upset.
[481:43.95]It was just chat's friendly banter.
[481:47.09]Oh, I know.
[481:47.49]Hey, uh, contrary to popular belief, as much as chat fucks with me, I fuck with you guys all the time.
[481:58.46]So, this is how we do it here.

[484:15.73]We're almost done.
[484:17.48]Cyberrisket, thanks for the $1.
[484:19.00]Jerma, now that you've played Detroit, you have to play a good game about androids.
[484:23.60]Near Autonoma.
[484:25.58]Autonomata, no, Hakuna Matata.
[484:28.37]It's probably the best game in 2017 and one of the best ever in my opinion.
[484:33.51]I will give Hakuna Matata a look, I promise.
[484:41.60]Hey, Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.
[484:43.72]E3 doesn't start until June 9th.

[484:57.59]Thanks for the tip there.
[485:01.67]Mostly lost.
[485:02.27]Thanks for the... 99 cents.
[485:04.43]Let's see if he reads this.
[485:05.99]I did.
[485:06.31]I just saw the... It's close enough.
[485:10.34]No, it's not close enough.
[485:17.54]Cat buttholes.
[485:18.44]Thanks for the... I did it again.
[485:20.34]95 cents.
[485:21.72]What are your thoughts on Fallout?
[485:25.88]Fallout's cool.
[485:28.20]Uh, Cat Buttholes.
[485:28.98]Okay, Cat Buttholes gets a pass here because this was $2.
[485:31.58]This was $1.95.
[485:32.20]What are your thoughts on Fallout 76?
[485:36.95]I don't know what that is.
[485:42.41]Maybe it'll be cool.
[485:44.01]Fallout Online.
[485:45.59]It's the new Fallout.
[485:49.13]The new Fallout game.
[485:49.97]Okay.
[485:50.85]I don't know.
[485:51.15]I don't know anything about it.
[485:51.95]The new Fallout, idiot.
[485:55.33]I don't know.
[485:55.77]I don't know.
[485:56.13]I don't know.
[485:57.83]Why are you screaming at me?
[485:59.19]What are you?
[486:00.31]Don't call me an idiot.
[486:03.04]Oh, wait.
[486:08.10]I just fucking hurt my thumb.
[486:10.48]I don't know how.
[486:16.56]I just like scraped my thumb.
[486:25.58]Thank you, cat butthole.
[486:27.78]For the multiple.
[486:29.96]One, two, three dollars here.
[486:32.76]I don't know much about it, so... Uh, Zarina, thanks for the $1.45.
[486:36.88]Bad streamer doesn't know he needs to get in the fucking water.
[486:42.02]What?
[486:42.18]I don't know what that means.
[486:44.52]Thank you, Darkstar, for the $1.
[486:46.36]I arrived a bit late, so forgive me if you already talked about this.
[486:49.22]But did you see the Fallout 76 teaser?
[486:50.64]What do you think about the info from anonymous developers on the game that they say it's an online survival game?
[486:59.03]I just hope it's not at Battlegrounds.
[487:02.83]I'm going to give you guys a prediction here, and I hope it's wrong.
[487:07.08]If the new Fallout game is a 100-person parachute survive Battlegrounds game, I'm not going to be happy.
[487:24.84]It's not, okay.
[487:30.74]Online survival game.
[487:32.20]Oh no, there it goes.
[487:34.79]It's going to be a 76 person shooter.
[487:45.85]But maybe we'll get some more info on it.
[487:48.19]Maybe I'll take a look at it.
[487:51.41]Thank you, The Orange Pyro Ranger for the $1.
[487:53.61]This was one of my favorite streams because of my high blood pressure from your choices making me feel doped up.

[488:42.22]That's your favorite chatter here?
[488:45.24]The best part of the chat?
[488:46.40]Your favorite streamer?
[488:47.52]Your favorite part of the stream chat is this?
[488:55.93]You need to sincerely rethink that.
[489:04.83]No, I didn't put that in quotes.
[489:06.91]I gotta... Whatever.
[489:11.23]Ha ha!
[489:12.43]Dekla!
[489:16.89]Petallix has definitely fallen a few rungs at this point.
[489:24.24]The stream is over.
[489:25.06]These are just people waiting for the Captain America after credits scene.
[489:30.90]Well, guess what?
[489:31.52]You're gonna sit through the whole thing and realize they never put one in.
[489:38.24]Hey, guess what?
[489:38.70]That's not even correct, because Captain America doesn't sit there and read donations.
[489:45.73]This is the after-credits scene.
[489:47.05]Captain America has his glasses on, and he's reading bits.
[489:51.37]This is what happens at the end of Infinity War.
[489:54.39]Everybody in the theater that donated money during the stream, or during the movie, he stops.
[489:59.73]The movie's over.
[490:00.73]Oh, that was right.
[490:01.85]And he saved the day, Cap.
[490:04.43]And then he puts on a movie over screen.
[490:07.40]And he sits there with a microphone.
[490:08.60]He's like, guy in the row number, row F seat four.
[490:14.06]Thank you so much for that.
[490:15.04]Thank you for the $4 there.
[490:17.58]You're going by JJ.
[490:19.42]Thank you.
[490:20.18]And they say Captain America sucks.
[490:23.32]He's got a little dick and a little shithead.
[490:25.94]Okay.
[490:28.06]Everybody laughs in the theater.
[490:29.48]Oh, we got him.
[490:30.32]Captain America said the thing.
[490:46.40]Captain America doesn't sound like that.
[490:48.18]Mine does.
[490:52.18]Oh, Big's projecting.
[490:56.13]Go to bed.
[490:56.69]Hey, thank you, Tay106 with $1.
[491:03.23]Hey, Jeremiah, I watched you for like six years.
[491:07.05]I'm just starting to get into your streams and it is awesome.
[491:12.94]Six years ago.
[491:13.62]That's a long time.
[491:14.50]Thank you, Tay.
[491:16.16]Welcome to the stream.
[491:16.78]Hope you enjoy our little back-and-forth Captain America banter here.
[491:21.85]We're all going to be superheroes.
[491:23.13]Thank you, Tay.
[491:27.57]Thank you, Morning Maple, for the 10 bucks.
[491:32.67]Oh, God.
[491:33.37]Here comes a mad paragraph.
[491:37.81]Jeremiah, I'm giving you even more bits to say this.
[491:39.89]You should pick what you want to do.
[491:42.57]Please don't open a poll.
[491:45.20]We're here to watch what Jerma985 picks, not what we pick.
[491:49.78]You're what we're here for.
[491:50.64]Besides, it's depressing to give us hope with a straw poll.
[491:53.12]It never works out.
[491:53.90]Just pick what you would do.
[491:56.50]And please remember that bullets kill people.
[491:59.32]So yes, shooting one will kill them.
[492:02.43]It won't be like haha with some pellets, you get what I mean.
[492:09.11]Well, I mean, I'm gonna counterpoint you here.
[492:12.63]There's been plenty of polls.
[492:15.22]that have been... We do polls all the time and they work out.
[492:21.76]And I only do them... I only do them like twice.
[492:24.40]Because, I don't know, sometimes when I get in a situation, I don't know what I would want to do.
[492:28.86]And instead of sitting there and being like, I don't know, I'm not sure what choice I'd like to make here.
[492:32.84]I just want to just involve people.
[492:36.55]We do them sometimes.
[492:45.51]And look, even if the polls are rigged as a joke, which I don't do that anyways.
[493:04.01]Look how complete.
[493:04.73]The last 80 revolution votes were me and incognito tabs.
[493:07.99]See?
[493:08.93]Look it.
[493:14.61]It was the right decision.
[493:25.11]Bro luck.
[493:25.73]I agree with Morning Maple.
[493:26.85]Thanks for the dollar.
[493:29.67]But at the end of the day, it doesn't matter anyways.
[493:35.45]We're just like dicking around playing a game.
[493:37.19]I don't see it as that big of a deal.
[493:45.15]We're just fucking around and like picking a choice in a video game that's just for fun.
[493:50.35]It's not like these choices really matter at the end of the day.
[493:53.55]Using a straw fall is like letting Luigi play.
[494:12.56]Air strike.
[494:19.74]It's not just a game!
[494:30.03]Hank is dead, this is serious!
[494:45.44]Smells like a skunk outside.
[494:54.71]I'm eight floors up, huh?
[494:55.77]Well, the thing's probably... The thing's probably died in your house.
[495:04.13]Well, thank you.
[495:04.63]Thank you, Cosmic Moses, for the one dollar.
[495:08.32]Because of you, Mr. Krabs never got his one millionth dollar.
[495:11.34]And I'm absolutely amazed that you got Connor killed four times.
[495:14.30]There's like a hundred Connors.
[495:30.79]Uh, we're skipping over Etalyx because he didn't meet the necessary dollar donation limit.
[495:34.32]So, sorry Etalyx.
[495:40.76]If you didn't, you must have missed the memo, Etalyx.
[495:45.28]Because you don't have to read your donation.
[495:48.32]It's 25 cents.
[495:50.82]Hey, thanks Dr. Clay for the one dollar.
[495:52.85]Here's another dollar.
[495:53.53]It's not much, but I just want to chip in.
[495:55.29]Thanks for the awesome streams.
[495:56.45]Are there any things that you're excited about with E3?
[496:03.29]Uh, not necessarily.
[496:05.33]Looking forward to... Actually, if there's any new FromSoftware stuff.
[496:11.30]If they actually show, like, oh, we're doing Bloodborne 2, or we're doing a different game.
[496:14.98]Armored Core 8.
[496:17.81]That's probably the only thing I'm interested in.
[496:19.09]Are they even going to be there?
[496:20.57]I'm not even sure.
[496:24.87]If they are, then I'm excited.
[496:28.08]We got two Jebaited donations here, both 99 cents.
[496:32.04]Almost got me there, but thanks for those.
[496:35.16]MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1.
[496:37.10]The fire rises, but the IQ drops.
[496:41.39]Jez, Jrez, thanks for the $1.
[496:43.25]Killed Hank.
[496:44.43]I did.
[496:46.73]Jrez again.
[496:47.59]Hank's still dead.
[496:48.37]Yes, he is.
[496:50.75]Thank you.
[496:51.11]Mostly lost for the $1.
[496:52.13]Seriously, I can't believe you got the best character in the game killed.
[496:54.49]Alright.
[496:55.03]Okay.
[496:56.03]Alright.
[497:02.32]Is this the same person?
[497:18.74]Save Hank on Saturday.
[497:22.12]I like the Bane voice.
[497:23.80]Oh my god.
[497:29.50]Alright, that's it guys.
[497:35.48]I will see you guys all on Saturday.
[497:42.47]Looks like we're upping the minimum bits again, chat.
[497:48.11]Long story short, hope you had a good time.
[497:51.86]I had a blast.
[497:52.60]I thought it was really fun.
[497:57.00]I think the game, I could recommend it.
[497:58.78]I think it's a pretty meaty game.
[498:02.27]I liked it.
[498:06.28]And with that, I'll see you guys all on Saturday for just a little bit.
[498:09.60]We'll stream for a couple hours probably on Saturday just to dick around and do some stuff in the game that we didn't get to do.
[498:17.12]And then Sunday is the Polygraph stream, so make sure the questions are all ready to go.
[498:22.24]You only got a few days to do that.
[498:25.04]Much love to all of you.
[498:27.28]And again, we're just fucking around here, you know what I mean?
[498:31.21]I hope you all understand that.
[498:32.25]I'm just having a good time.
[498:41.74]uh Dr. clay thanks for the one dollar hank didn't die he just faked his death so he can live his dream of being a propane salesman in Texas and like cat buttholes do you think I'm gonna read that not only is it under the minimum bits but it's a bunch of it's a bunch of it's a bunch it's like a nonsense sentence
[499:08.38]Yeah, there's a Discord if you haven't been around for a while or you're new to the channel.
[499:13.92]The Discord is open.
[499:16.16]You don't have to be subs.
[499:16.96]There's a sub channel, but it's open to the public.
[499:18.65]A lot of people there.
[499:24.43]It's a lot of cool stuff going on there.
[499:30.35]And with that, have a great weekend, guys.
[499:34.81]See you on Saturday.
