[00:35.03]Alright, I'm just gonna... Mario Yahtzee.
[00:40.31]Mario Yahtzee Rematch.
[00:42.81]Alright, hey!
[00:44.59]I know exactly where that is.
[00:45.74]I can get it right now.
[00:46.56]Isn't that interesting?
[00:50.42]Mario... Game Gallery.
[00:55.38]You thought this was gonna take a while.
[00:57.90]Oh, BRP guys, I gotta like set this shit up.
[00:59.98]Nope, nope, nope.
[01:03.74]along with Presage, proudly present... Mario's Game Gallery.
[01:20.84]Mm-hmm.
[01:21.12]Mm-hmm.
[01:22.16]Mm-hmm.
[01:39.79]Turn the PS4 off, get this on the screen.
[01:41.67]Hey, you thought it was gonna take more than five seconds.
[01:43.97]Welcome to Mario Yahtzee.
[01:46.51]Wait, hold on.
[01:52.28]Best out of three.
[01:55.12]See if I can beat Mario again at his own game.
[01:59.30]Do you talk to Transformer after this?
[02:00.68]Uh, if we still have some time, I'll do it.
[02:02.96]Maybe we'll do that tomorrow.
[02:05.24]That's something we can do tomorrow.
[02:10.94]Alright, Yahtzee.
[02:11.88]No, no, no, no.
[02:12.90]Yahtzee.
[02:13.22]No, no.
[02:13.56]What are you doing?
[02:14.26]Alright, here we go.
[02:15.22]It's like I never left.
[02:38.95]He's gonna go straight here.
[02:40.09]Gonna get a big straight.
[02:46.88]Don't you start it off with a big straight.
[02:49.74]Ah, it's alright.
[02:57.07]Wait, he left?
[02:57.67]Did I fall asleep?
[03:00.07]Yeah.
[03:00.49]I mean, it's a generic kind of open world kill zombies game.
[03:07.70]Not a whole lot of freedom with the car.
[03:09.76]Not a whole lot of freedom with the environments.
[03:12.59]But you know, whatever.
[03:13.31]It's still, it was alright.
[03:14.59]It was alright.
[03:17.11]Look, okay.
[03:17.69]I didn't get like food poisoning from eating at that restaurant.
[03:22.43]I didn't really like eating there, but I'm going to be alright.
[03:32.91]Ooh, alright.
[03:33.81]So we got one, three, three.
[03:35.45]I'm thinking we do one, two, three, four.
[03:38.35]Let's go for it.
[03:39.65]We need a two?
[03:40.79]No, we don't.
[03:41.09]We need a... No.
[03:43.33]Hold the threes.
[03:55.58]Don't be nice anymore.
[03:56.84]The Days Gone devs aren't here anymore.
[03:59.44]It's alright.
[04:04.65]Fuck.
[04:07.73]I should just pick the one.
[04:15.28]It's the best out of three, guys.
[04:17.40]We've got plenty of opportunity.
[04:22.08]Oh, goddammit.
[04:24.50]Full house and small straight immediately.
[04:35.72]Come on.
[04:39.32]I think I just take the small straight here.
[04:40.84]I mean, that's what I'm gonna do.
[04:47.04]I'm just taking the straight.
[04:50.96]48 points to one.
[04:53.91]Go for the, yeah, go for the big one.
[04:59.23]Three, four, five, let's go.
[05:03.33]Two, give me a two.
[05:08.27]It's not a two.
[05:17.61]I'm a really enjoy playing with you.
[05:23.57]Mario, go fish.
[05:26.05]I got it.
[05:28.73]Go back to days gone.
[05:30.24]You don't get to have it both ways.
[05:32.06]Okay, guys?
[05:32.72]Hmm.
[05:37.41]I ain't gonna get bullied out of Days Gone to do the thing that everyone wanted to then be like, wait, wait, wait.
[05:44.57]Can you go back to Days Gone?
[05:46.35]That was fun.
[05:47.65]They're both the same time.
[05:55.42]I can't do that.
[05:56.28]Okay, so we're gonna go with fives here.
[06:02.88]We could do two, three, four, five.
[06:05.06]I mean, we could go, we could try for a big straight.
[06:12.02]Just need a six or a one.
[06:17.96]Give it to me.
[06:26.80]It's gonna have to be choice.
[06:37.32]Damn it.
[06:38.40]Choice or twos?
[06:41.80]Mmm... It's gonna have to be twos.
[06:49.33]Okay!
[06:51.21]Damn it.
[06:52.97]Damn it!
[06:53.57]It's alright.
[06:54.67]He can win one.
[06:56.11]He won't win this, though.
[07:01.72]But he has nothing on fives.
[07:04.92]Hmm...
[07:12.51]Mario's gonna put this on the five line.
[07:16.89]I mean, this is not bad.
[07:18.27]This is not a bad thing.
[07:20.25]I just need to get, I gotta get some good sixes, fives, and fours.
[07:24.81]And I'll be good to go.
[07:34.91]This is bad.
[07:37.31]Hold the three and roll everything else.
[07:40.19]It's just, it's bad.
[07:41.99]Bad.
[07:45.30]A full house, though?
[07:46.38]I mean, a full house with these is so bad.
[07:50.26]This is going to be... How many points is that going to be?
[07:57.66]That's a waste.
[08:00.18]Yeah, I'm not going to do that.
[08:01.02]I'm just going to... I'm holding the three and just roll it.
[08:07.57]Oh, come on.
[08:19.27]I wish I didn't do the aces before.
[08:22.55]No, I'm not going to forfeit.
[08:23.55]This is still a winnable game.
[08:24.61]Alright, I'll take this terrible roll.
[08:31.88]It's fine.
[08:35.32]It is still winnable.
[08:40.98]Look at all the options I have.
[08:45.61]What's he going for?
[08:46.95]Four of a kind.
[08:48.33]This is going to be hard to do if he gets this.
[08:51.93]Four of a kind will make this very hard to play.
[08:57.02]Or he might just get a Yahtzee.
[09:06.56]Not the worst possible scenario.
[09:16.22]Why are you giving this to me now?
[09:18.26]I just had to... I keep getting the turn after the first... I mean, go for a full house.
[09:26.81]Just try to get a four.
[09:27.81]This is the best I'm going to get.
[09:31.39]Or roll the four.
[09:33.79]Or go for four of a kind.
[09:36.92]I'm not going to get it, though.
[09:40.34]Try it.
[09:44.94]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!
[09:47.06]Give me the Yahtzee!
[09:48.40]And I'm back in the game.
[09:50.70]Do it.
[10:04.29]Back in the game.
[10:14.11]Back in it!
[10:14.81]Now we have a chance to win.
[10:19.11]Although that kind of sucks that he got that.
[10:23.58]That actually, that really sucks.
[10:25.08]Because now I have to get a big straight.
[10:28.48]Or... I wonder if I hold the 4.
[10:39.90]Hold the 4 and try for it, or hold the 6?
[10:47.67]Let's try fours.
[10:55.54]Four, four, four, four!
[10:56.92]Ugh, I would've got a six too.
[10:58.36]Shit.
[11:00.16]I might throw this on choice.
[11:01.10]This is dog shit.
[11:13.05]20, that's not bad.
[11:15.53]These are both not good enough.
[11:17.17]I'm just gonna do Choice.
[11:17.90]20 points for Choice, that's not terrible.
[11:21.66]That's pretty good.
[11:31.00]As long as you... If you get more than 19 points... If you get 20 or more for Choice, that's fine.
[11:37.21]That's a good roll.
[11:40.84]What is he going for?
[11:41.60]Four of a kind?
[11:42.38]Ones?
[11:45.62]Oh, fuck you.
[11:49.70]I think this is unwinnable.
[11:54.62]This is, uh... It's gonna be close.
[11:58.54]I need a straight.
[11:59.58]I need a big straight.
[12:00.86]Or, you know what?
[12:01.60]I'll take a goddamn... Okay, hold on a minute here.
[12:04.64]What happens if you get a Yahtzee again?
[12:07.43]Is it just a four of a kind always?
[12:09.77]Or will I get more points?
[12:16.05]Like, I can get five fives, right?
[12:30.67]Is it worth... Is it worth doing the fives or is it worth taking the four of a kind?
[12:37.05]It's the four of a kind, definitely.
[12:39.54]Unless I get five here.
[12:44.52]Well, four of a kind.
[12:53.22]What?
[12:53.42]The points went up.
[12:54.03]It went up by two points, yeah.
[13:04.92]What is Otto doing out there?
[13:05.99]I can hear Otto, like... Otto's like... It's going for four of a kind.
[13:09.87]This is going to be... If he gets it, though... After this game, he's just being like a weirdo out there.
[13:21.32]He's just going like, hey!
[13:22.10]Let's see what he's doing.
[13:23.24]That's fine.
[13:23.62]Okay.
[13:39.75]Mama mia Mama mia Hey, what's it taking so long?
[14:11.95]Mamma mia.
[14:13.71]Hey, he's just being like a little weirdo.
[14:17.61]He's just like rolling around being like, eh.
[14:20.99]Okay, Mario, let's go.
[14:23.25]You did it on the ones?
[14:24.29]Alright, so we can do fours or fives.
[14:34.90]Let's go with fours.
[14:38.46]No, full house is not.
[14:39.52]Let's go just roll fours, see if I can get some good ones.
[14:47.34]1, 2, 3, 4.
[14:48.54]But 1, 2, 3, 4.
[14:53.58]Don't people get mad at me when I do this?
[15:07.19]Come on.
[15:08.41]This is the only way I can win, right? 2.
[15:22.05]Okay.
[15:23.45]It's my turn now!
[15:24.63]Is that a good game?
[15:27.29]That actually might be over.
[15:29.21]I even got a Yahtzee, too, and he came with all one Yahtzee.
[15:32.27]This shouldn't even count.
[15:33.89]It should be like 25 points for that.
[15:37.15]He's gonna get five.
[15:38.61]Four of a kind here.
[15:39.21]I got it!
[15:40.01]This game over.
[15:45.82]Let's see.
[15:48.20]That's going on the four of the kind line.
[15:53.46]I mean, if I get five sixes, maybe?
[15:58.27]Is this still possible?
[15:59.65]Or is this actually unwinnable?
[16:04.53]It's definitely unwinnable.
[16:06.39]I'm gonna try it, though.
[16:08.29]Well, I might as well just do the five first.
[16:20.08]Roll for the straight.
[16:22.86]I can't.
[16:26.74]That's the best full house I'm going to get.
[16:31.98]Wait!
[16:33.14]Wait!
[16:33.82]Don't!
[16:34.21]Wait!
[16:39.97]He's playing Yahtzee again.
[16:41.03]It's fun, it is.
[16:41.39]He would have to get no more sixes.
[16:50.86]It's... I mean, he might roll the... Yeah, just get one six.
[16:54.58]Just completely screw him over here.
[16:56.88]Okay.
[16:58.44]Okay.
[16:59.26]The threes?
[17:05.29]Oh, alright.
[17:06.49]He just threw that one in the garbage.
[17:07.99]Fuck.
[17:15.84]Why?
[17:18.24]Why?
[17:20.92]Five, sixes are straight.
[17:23.14]There's no fives or sixes here.
[17:31.17]Well, there's the fives.
[17:32.45]There's the opportunity.
[17:34.69]One, two, three, four.
[17:37.40]No.
[17:39.88]Just give me some more fives.
[17:48.35]Might as well go out with dignity, right?
[17:51.41]Shut up!
[17:51.97]I'm just kidding, I'm sorry.
[18:03.42]You sound so defeated.
[18:06.54]I care more about Mario Yahtzee than I do about Days Gone.
[18:12.20]Oh, goddammit.
[18:13.12]This is over.
[18:18.84]So does everybody else.
[18:28.02]Play it out.
[18:32.78]Sixes.
[18:33.66]We can't do it straight.
[18:35.60]I could have used this so long ago.
[18:45.80]Come on, fill it up with sixes.
[18:47.14]At least give me something cool.
[18:47.94]Unwinnable.
[18:51.73]Wait, oh, 20, 30 points, right?
[18:53.75]Yeah, unwinnable.
[18:55.53]Game over.
[19:12.01]You never defeat Mario.
[19:13.05]I defeated him last time.
[19:14.77]I beat him in a best two out of three.
[19:15.89]I beat him at Go Fish.
[19:28.64]I beat him at Yahtzee.
[19:29.84]He beat me in Checkers.
[19:32.68]I'm not done.
[19:33.96]We're going again.
[19:41.35]Uh, I'm just gonna go for the straight.
[19:44.01]Okay.
[19:50.77]Gimme.
[19:52.45]Gimme.
[19:53.37]That's it.
[19:53.79]I got it.
[19:54.67]I'm a really enjoy playing with you.
[19:57.49]I got a better score this time.
[19:59.17]I win.
[19:59.71]Hey, how about another game with me?
[20:01.85]Uh, yeah.
[20:08.87]Alright, first game goes to Mario.
[20:11.45]Second game is gonna come back to the hometown, to me.
[20:15.37]We're playing on home turf now.
[20:19.36]We're in a stadium with 40,000 people watching us play Yahtzee.
[20:25.10]He's gonna start off strong here.
[20:26.18]Ah, fuck.
[20:27.88]This is bad.
[20:31.94]I got it.
[20:40.17]Alright, my turn.
[20:50.96]Yahtzee right off the bat.
[20:55.20]One, two, three!
[20:59.21]I can get- I just need a two.
[21:02.07]I need a four.
[21:03.35]This is not gonna work.
[21:04.23]Let's just go with the ones.
[21:20.67]It's alright.
[21:23.96]That's not a bad Aces.
[21:31.68]Please use this emote.
[21:32.64]It feels useless.
[21:33.76]Well, don't say that.
[21:36.68]What is he trying to do?
[21:44.28]Why is he holding the two ones?
[21:47.96]For the full house?
[21:49.98]Why wouldn't you just roll for the ones?
[21:53.50]Well, I already have the straight.
[22:03.21]Let's go for the big one.
[22:17.64]Five.
[22:21.55]Five.
[22:28.11]No!
[22:36.48]What can we expect is an eSports, the Mario eSports Yahtzee?
[22:47.22]Don't do it.
[22:51.40]You're gonna take a shitty two.
[22:53.04]Ooh.
[23:04.16]Okay.
[23:05.52]Now we've got an opportunity here.
[23:07.80]I'm going for straight up sixes.
[23:12.91]Give me some sixes.
[23:23.71]I can still do choice, even if it's not good.
[23:27.20]Give me at least one more, come on.
[23:29.52]Six.
[23:31.52]Alright.
[23:33.28]Alright, so, alright, hold on a second here though.
[23:38.02]Do I take the full house with the one and the six, or do I just take the sixes?
[23:41.50]Or do I take it as a choice?
[23:45.60]Because that's like bad and good.
[23:55.78]Sixes.
[23:58.74]We might not get this again.
[23:59.80]We might not see that again.
[24:04.76]This guy stinks.
[24:15.07]That's gonna be the move that wins me the championship, just watch.
[24:17.97]Oh no.
[24:19.71]Here comes the Yahtzee.
[24:23.70]That's alright.
[24:24.22]I'll take that.
[24:24.90]Tie game.
[24:25.48]Alright.
[24:26.36]Roll the fours or roll the... Yeah.
[24:29.94]Yeah.
[24:30.06]Roll the fours.
[25:01.03]I just, mmm, I mean, I could go for the f- I could... I could do it, I could go for it.
[25:09.75]I could go for it!
[25:17.36]I just need a five!
[25:27.35]Sometimes you gotta fucking do it.
[25:40.39]19's not bad for choice, it's fine.
[25:42.44]20 points, it's fine.
[25:53.70]Spirit broken.
[25:56.33]No, I'm good.
[25:58.27]He's got a best line, not good.
[26:02.85]That's not even that good.
[26:03.83]Three is not even that good.
[26:14.53]Take straight for the kind.
[26:16.95]One, two, three, four.
[26:21.67]One, two, three, four, five.
[26:27.46]Give me a two.
[26:29.18]Give me a two.
[26:47.28]Yeah!
[26:49.78]Big hit!
[26:50.32]Big win!
[26:50.80]Oh no!
[26:51.64]Big hand!
[26:52.84]It's my turn now.
[26:56.99]Big win.
[26:59.81]Hmm...
[27:06.67]I just pulled ahead by a lot in here.
[27:13.10]Uh-oh.
[27:16.34]Going for the Yahtzee.
[27:18.26]Oh, fuck you.
[27:20.73]Fuck.
[27:21.43]Oh well.
[27:22.71]Unbelievable.
[27:23.55]Whatever, I can still win.
[27:26.39]I have to get a Yahtzee.
[27:27.71]We gotta make it happen.
[27:29.55]We gotta go for big odds here.
[27:30.81]Big Vegas odds.
[27:50.21]Come on.
[27:51.37]Give me at least another three.
[27:53.43]Give me four of a kind.
[27:58.03]Well, give me a Yahtzee right here.
[27:59.03]Oh well.
[28:04.78]You're gonna get a big straight.
[28:18.51]Oh no, he'll get such good points here.
[28:20.57]Noooo.
[28:21.31]I have to get a Yahtzee.
[28:27.40]I have to get a Yahtzee.
[28:28.78]I have to.
[28:29.40]Come on.
[28:48.59]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[28:50.29]Here we go.
[28:51.39]This is my chance to... And then it's a game again.
[28:55.19]We have a one in six chance to get this.
[28:58.15]It's very doable.
[28:59.57]It is.
[29:02.24]Four.
[29:08.18]Ah.
[29:11.92]That four of a kind is better too.
[29:17.37]Damn it.
[29:26.21]Four.
[29:26.59]Is it four of a kind?
[29:27.81]Probably four of a kind.
[29:28.85]I don't know, because it could be... He's got that two-point differential.
[29:38.09]I might not get another four of a kind.
[29:42.12]I might not get another four of a kind.
[29:43.60]Hmm.
[29:45.02]Hmm.
[29:57.15]What are you, full house?
[29:59.97]It's gonna, that's not, no, don't, um, my god.
[30:03.35]Come on.
[30:03.71]Um...
[30:24.87]I could go for the four of a kind with the ones.
[30:27.87]Or roll the five.
[30:32.70]No, two?
[30:33.30]I don't even have a two.
[30:42.50]Do I just roll the two?
[30:43.70]Do I salvage this and roll the two?
[30:45.38]Or do I keep the fives and try to pour it?
[30:47.24]Oh, I don't know.
[30:49.40]I might just roll the two.
[31:04.50]I should have rolled the fucking two.
[31:06.00]He's gonna win again.
[31:10.64]No.
[31:13.59]Then we're gonna be tied up.
[31:14.83]I won a series and then he won a series.
[31:17.27]We have to do another one.
[31:17.95]It wouldn't help.
[31:18.55]Meh.
[31:26.07]Is this still winnable?
[31:36.35]If I get a Yahtzee, maybe.
[31:39.71]There are the twos.
[31:41.69]Two.
[32:02.44]Oh, yeah.
[32:05.06]Here comes the Yahtzee.
[32:08.89]Yahtzee.
[32:09.77]Ready?
[32:10.39]Are you ready?
[32:11.19]Here it comes.
[32:19.85]The game's not even fun.
[32:24.81]I don't even know why people play this.
[32:32.08]Go back to Days Gone.
[32:34.44]No, we're done with that one.
[32:43.25]Mario Yahtzee is the Days Gone of Yahtzee games.
[32:48.61]Yeah, we're getting destroyed.
[32:56.72]I mean, if I can get a four of a kind with sixes, or... I just need sixes all across the board.
[33:05.40]That's not it.
[33:07.14]I gotta go for the Yahtzee.
[33:08.19]I have to go for the four of a kind.
[33:09.37]I have to go for the four of a kind.
[33:10.87]I have to.
[33:14.21]If I throw the six, then I have to try.
[33:17.25]That's the only way I'm gonna be able to try to get a Yahtzee.
[33:21.39]Yeah, but the six is... It's not gonna happen.
[33:25.34]I'm so unlucky.
[33:30.53]Look what happened!
[33:33.43]And now I have to take the dumb, crappy six!
[33:43.35]And look what happened!
[33:56.48]The game is unwinnable.
[34:00.25]If he gets another six, it's over.
[34:03.64]I mean, I think it already is unwinnable.
[34:15.23]I think that puts it out of reach completely.
[34:16.71]Yeah, it's impossible.
[34:19.09]I would need four sixes and then a Yahtzee, but I don't think that's even going to do it.
[34:25.14]Holy shit.
[34:26.78]And when you pray, you get it.
[34:30.54]You just, when you pray for it, sometimes it happens.
[34:33.92]Four of a kind with six.
[34:38.94]Oh, come on, do it.
[34:40.36]Just do it.
[34:41.60]Do it so I can win.
[34:42.94]Just do it so I can win.
[34:43.73]Just let me, I'm not even gonna give, give me a small victory here.
[34:49.75]Not even gonna give me a small victory.
[34:50.99]That's it.
[35:01.79]Here is fives, yeah.
[35:03.47]Oh, Mario rolled five of a kind.
[35:10.49]Oh, he wins the series.
[35:15.55]That's two out of three, he wins.
[35:17.67]He wins the series.
[35:23.64]So this next series of games, this is the world championship coming up here.
[35:29.68]It's the best of three series.
[35:32.74]I said 3 out of 5?
[35:33.40]Well, I won 2 out of 3 last time, and this is 2 out of 3 here this time.
[35:39.20]None of this even matters.
[35:41.30]Just give me the... It doesn't even matter.
[35:44.13]I lose.
[35:44.47]Like, who cares?
[35:55.93]Okay!
[35:57.14]Thank you so much!
[35:58.60]Nice game!
[36:01.80]Yeah, I'll do another one.
[36:07.02]Here we go.
[36:07.74]This is the start of a new series.
[36:11.06]Game 1 of the World Series.
[36:13.00]And we're playing Best of 3.
[36:16.49]Yeah, I got crushed two times in a row.
[36:24.73]You're addicted.
[36:25.37]It's easy to get addicted to this game.
[36:30.06]Do they have new versions of this?
[36:32.13]Actual... This is definitely on an iPad.
[36:35.65]This is some shitty iPad game I can play.
[36:41.03]I can't wait to get Yahtzee for iPad and play it in bed.
[36:44.82]That's not a good four of a kind.
[36:46.82]14 points?
[36:49.86]I wouldn't have done that.
[36:50.80]Well...
[37:01.43]Got the straight already.
[37:07.69]Go for the big one.
[37:13.28]Let's go.
[37:19.36]Damn it.
[37:24.60]Two.
[37:26.36]Ah.
[37:27.92]Oh no!
[37:32.55]Are you playing at a huge table?
[37:33.75]No, we're playing, we're lying in the grass.
[37:35.25]We're in Mario's backyard.
[37:40.10]That's good.
[38:00.97]That's very good.
[38:02.45]Four.
[38:02.77]Mmm.
[38:03.11]Okay.
[38:06.07]I'm ready.
[38:14.59]One, two, three.
[38:15.45]I could go for the big again.
[38:17.03]I want... I'm going for it.
[38:25.99]Big straight.
[38:27.62]Give me a five.
[38:29.46]Come on.
[38:34.19]Ah, come on.
[38:35.21]Don't make me pick a shitty choice here.
[38:36.51]Do it!
[38:44.21]Game 1's in my pocket.
[38:45.47]It's already here.
[38:47.89]See, right now Mario is internally... infuriated by what just happened there.
[38:57.73]Ah, it feels great.
[39:00.27]Why can I play- Why can you play this in the casino?
[39:03.45]Okay, somebody look it up.
[39:04.93]Are there any Yahtzee's tables in Las Vegas?
[39:09.87]Can I play Yahtzee at the casino?
[39:10.97]There is no house edge.
[39:13.55]Yeah, but he got a small straight.
[39:33.43]There is Yahtzee in Las Vegas.
[39:36.25]That's all I needed to hear.
[39:39.21]Okay, so we can do... Let's grab the sixes.
[39:44.13]Let's go for a big six.
[39:53.62]I can't wait to play.
[39:54.40]Are you telling me there really is Yahtzee in Vegas?
[39:57.14]Holy shit, I'm doing it.
[40:14.73]Ah, choice.
[40:15.79]They get twice as many rolls for house advantage.
[40:24.95]No they don't, do they?
[40:30.71]Look at all the practice I'm getting.
[40:31.77]Yeah, playing against Mario.
[40:36.09]I've been in Vegas for about like seven or so months.
[40:39.31]Seven and a half months, something like that.
[40:45.06]That's a hell of an advantage.
[40:48.28]We get to roll twice.
[40:50.18]That's bullshit.
[40:51.08]I would never play that.
[40:53.66]I would rather eat my money than do that.
[40:56.31]So what are we looking for here?
[41:04.45]We're looking for...
[41:08.99]Threes.
[41:12.31]See if we can't pull something out here with threes.
[41:21.58]I'm switching it to the ones.
[41:31.34]There you go.
[41:33.09]See, that's the kind of play I would do at the table, and everyone would be like, the guy with the cigar in his mouth would turn and be like, holy shit.
[41:37.53]This guy knows what he's doing.
[41:39.69]Uh-oh.
[41:44.68]Here comes the odds.
[41:50.70]He gets it every time first.
[41:53.30]This is the third game in a row he'd get it.
[41:55.86]Thank God.
[41:56.32]That's going on the trees line.
[42:00.47]Okie dokie.
[42:01.53]Your move.
[42:04.77]Yeah, I am drinking pineapple juice.
[42:05.97]How could you tell?
[42:07.09]Did anybody even say that?
[42:08.01]Did I make that up?
[42:16.01]Am I arguing in my own head again?
[42:17.43]Alright, let's get some fives.
[42:19.91]Or four of a kind would be great.
[42:26.52]Bingo.
[42:28.22]Yahtzee.
[42:30.61]Do it.
[42:31.65]Do it.
[42:31.99]And win.
[42:32.49]Do it and win.
[42:33.07]Do it and win.
[42:33.61]Do it and win.
[42:35.13]Aww.
[42:40.94]Pineapple juice is gonna melt your stomach.
[42:43.26]I'll be fine.
[42:47.20]I'll be alright.
[42:56.64]It's very pineapple-y.
[42:58.76]Yeah, that's the best four of a kind I'll ever get.
[43:00.14]Unless it was a six, but didn't have any sixes.
[43:06.91]Let us play with smart click.
[43:08.71]Now that would take forever.
[43:09.65]Uh-oh.
[43:11.97]This is bad.
[43:13.97]What do you get for the... Do you get 22 points?
[43:17.35]That's actually pretty good.
[43:28.35]Mario only enjoys playing with you when he's winning.
[43:35.44]Well, I can do fives.
[43:36.76]I can also try for the two... I can do full house.
[43:39.48]A terrible full house, but it's still a full house.
[43:49.01]I'm doing it.
[43:53.35]Oh, that sucks.
[43:55.31]That's so bad.
[43:56.31]That's terrible.
[43:57.15]13 points.
[43:59.13]Why did I do this?
[44:07.00]That's so bad.
[44:07.88]No, I'm taking it.
[44:23.85]That's a great move.
[44:26.67]It's my turn now.
[44:28.43]If I got two fives there, that would have been worse than a full house there.
[44:40.98]This is the part where the guy with the cigar puts it back in his mouth and shakes his head and looks away.
[44:45.38]I thought I could trust you, kid.
[44:49.38]That's going on the aces line.
[44:54.42]That's when the guy grabs you, like, smears his hand on the table with the fork, random chips, into his lap.
[45:02.40]I'm going to another fucking table.
[45:05.16]This guy's an idiot.
[45:10.74]And then I have a conversation with the dealer.
[45:12.56]Oh, yeah, I'm on, like, vacation with me and my family.
[45:15.54]Mario, I'm trying to tell a joke.
[45:20.36]Ooh.
[45:29.25]Bingo.
[45:29.81]Bang.
[45:31.35]Ah, do it.
[45:36.21]Oh, shit.
[45:38.13]That's a good move.
[45:40.27]It's my turn now.
[45:45.85]Dude, they really do have this in Vegas.
[45:47.31]I got it.
[45:48.69]I'm gonna just go start smoking cigars and just sit there and play all day for like 25 cents a hand.
[45:53.09]Hmm.
[45:57.55]I'm gonna roll these ones again.
[45:59.76]Yahtzee again!
[46:05.38]Hmm.
[46:07.26]Mario's gonna put this on the sixes line.
[46:13.35]Your roll.
[46:18.11]What's the matter?
[46:18.51]What?
[46:19.77]What do you need?
[46:21.65]He's looking at me like, hey.
[46:24.28]He's like, don't smoke.
[46:26.09]Don't do that.
[46:26.79]Mamma mia.
[46:28.79]Otto.
[46:30.39]What's the matter?
[46:31.01]What do you need?
[46:33.57]He's just like kind of staring at me like, hey.
[46:36.57]Do you need to go outside?
[46:37.51]You want to go outside?
[46:38.87]I think you might need to go out.
[46:40.85]Do you need to go outside?
[46:44.15]Is that what your problem is?
[46:44.75]Is that your problem?
[46:46.64]What's the emergency?
[46:47.94]Emergency.
[46:48.46]I have to go outside.
[46:49.06]Why did it take so long?
[46:50.62]Mario, deal with it.
[46:52.68]I'm talking to my dog.
[46:55.57]Show us the dog?
[46:56.23]I can't.
[46:57.23]I'm dressed like an asshole.
[46:59.09]I can't.
[47:00.69]Let me... I gotta take him out.
[47:02.55]I think he wants to go outside.
[47:03.93]So, give me... Give me, like, a minute or two.
[47:06.89]I know I'm stopping.
[47:07.77]Like, I'm getting off the table mid-game.
[47:09.77]Hold on.
[47:12.80]Yeah, I'll be back.
[47:13.98]Just, like, hold my place.
[47:19.72]Hold my place.
[47:20.34]I'll be right back.
[47:26.43]He's so angry.
[47:29.49]Alright, beer beat.

[51:06.74]This is scary.
[51:09.87]Well, I... I had an extra pair of dice.
[51:14.59]It was under my sleeve at Mario's casino.
[51:19.59]They dragged me right out of the back.
[51:20.93]Alright, here we go.
[51:25.68]What's happening in the background?
[51:27.60]You may have missed it like an hour ago.
[51:37.68]to yeah that was from like an hour ago alright here we go I'm back at the table hi Mario alright here we go I'm gonna win this one bingo three threes yeah auto had to pee
[52:03.77]He had to pee real bad, actually.
[52:05.59]He sprayed it out.
[52:06.27]He was like, oh god!
[52:08.45]He just peed for like 25 seconds.
[52:13.28]That was, no, that's way too long.
[52:14.40]Maybe like four.
[52:16.14]Or five.
[52:18.76]It was definitely not 25 seconds.
[52:22.85]Into a bottle!
[52:23.87]And he was in the passenger seat!
[52:28.47]Come on.
[52:29.71]Another three.
[52:33.34]It's alright.
[52:36.10]Whatever.
[52:38.85]Why would you count?
[52:39.71]I'm just out there going 1, 2, 3, 4... Wow, that's a long one!
[52:49.07]Does he have a win condition here?
[52:51.51]If I get... No, he does.
[52:53.51]Still a game.
[52:58.49]Let's see.
[53:00.90]That's going on the fours line.
[53:04.00]I can live with that.
[53:04.50]That's alright.
[53:05.32]Okie dokie.
[53:06.38]Your move.
[53:13.33]He's building his late game.
[53:15.17]He's trying to.
[53:17.85]Too bad.
[53:18.21]This would have been an amazing full house.
[53:22.71]Sixes of five.
[53:23.55]I'm going to do the sixes.
[53:24.31]Let's go for it.
[53:32.01]Do it!
[53:33.67]One more!
[53:39.75]Well, that's unfortunate.
[53:45.39]It's okay though.
[53:49.51]Were you playing that back to work clip while you were away?
[53:51.59]Yeah.
[53:59.92]What's he going for?
[54:01.04]He already has his sixes.
[54:02.14]What are you trying to do?
[54:04.54]Are you trying to get a Yahtzee?
[54:08.32]Why would you go... What are you going to put this on?
[54:16.31]Why would you do that?
[54:16.99]He just blew the whole game.
[54:23.04]He actually, I think, just blew it.
[54:29.40]Oh, alright.
[54:29.74]Well, whatever, Mario.
[54:32.48]It's not my role.
[54:33.50]I'm not going to tell you how to do it.
[54:45.39]Way to go!
[54:47.44]It's my turn now!
[54:49.86]He has to get a straight Ariadze.
[54:51.68]It's not going to happen.
[54:54.50]Hmm...
[54:57.43]No, no, the game's over.
[54:58.07]This is game over.
[54:59.35]It's the hardest thing to get in the whole game.
[55:08.22]Holy shit, he got it.
[55:09.28]Oh, that's bad.
[55:09.90]Oh, no.
[55:24.37]Oh, he didn't?
[55:24.83]Okay, for a second, I looked down, and like scratched my nose, and I heard, That's going on the big straight!
[55:31.93]And I was like, oh, there, he got it.
[55:35.15]Uh, fives.
[55:50.68]Let me put this game away...
[56:04.46]So he can still win if he gets a Yahtzee he needs No, he's gonna don't get a Yahtzee.
[56:15.73]That's not good.
[56:17.91]Oh God Don't get a six
[56:26.60]Thank God.
[56:28.74]Game over.
[56:30.06]That was... That was scary.
[56:41.27]See if I can get it.
[56:42.65]I'll try, Mario.
[56:43.29]I'm trying to roll, man.
[56:54.30]No, don't matter.
[56:56.78]One more!
[56:58.94]If I win the next one... Then I win the championship against Mario and Yahtzee.
[57:08.59]Mario, I'm going for it.
[57:11.95]You gotta win two more.
[57:13.59]I just have to win this one.
[57:21.81]That's a pretty strong start.
[57:23.15]If he gets a full house here, that's a strong... Oh, not good.
[57:31.32]28 points.
[57:36.58]Shit.
[57:40.80]I get it.
[57:41.12]Let me answer with something big.
[57:45.84]No, that's not what I want.
[57:47.18]I don't want to do a full house with 1 and 3.
[58:06.38]He took off the weights.
[58:08.86]I can't restart.
[58:12.32]Holy shit, these huge numbers.
[58:17.42]He's going for straight.
[58:24.46]Glad he didn't hold the sixes and the fives, because that would have been bad.
[58:29.26]Let's see.
[58:32.32]It's really not hard to get a little straight.
[58:39.77]That doesn't concern me that much.
[58:42.93]I should still... Hmm.
[58:51.33]Fives, or should I go for two, three?
[58:56.63]Should I go for the big one?
[58:57.53]Or just do the fives?
[59:09.50]It's too risky.
[59:10.12]Yeah, it is too risky, but I'm doing it anyways.
[59:19.46]Bingo.
[59:22.39]Do not answer with a big straight.
[59:37.11]Hmm.
[59:39.00]No, don't do it.
[59:39.90]Don't get a one.
[59:41.94]Something bad.
[59:42.48]Something terrible.
[59:44.34]Yes.
[59:47.11]That is dog shit.
[59:48.03]Good.
[59:48.73]Two fives.
[59:51.55]Mario is echoing.
[59:56.83]He's echoing.
[60:01.10]What do you mean?
[60:01.54]He's echoing?
[60:06.24]Mamma mia.
[60:08.21]I've also been, my audio's been delayed this whole time.
[60:13.73]We can hear him through your mic.
[60:15.09]Oh, it's because the game's really loud.
[60:16.93]Mamma mia.
[60:21.96]I, uh, was delayed by about a full second, so.
[60:24.80]I was probably reacting a second later than when things happened.
[60:27.28]Mamma mia.
[60:28.62]I know, I get it.
[60:29.22]Let's go.
[60:31.02]I get it, Mario.
[60:34.24]We can hear through your dangling headphone.
[60:38.03]That's so funny.
[60:39.19]It really is hanging down right here.
[60:45.85]Because my audio was delayed.
[60:47.73]That's great.
[60:52.94]Let's go... No, that's not good, but it might be all I could get.
[60:58.26]What do you think?
[60:59.66]Four and three.
[61:00.62]Full house.
[61:05.54]Better opportunity later.
[61:10.04]I'm gonna go for it.
[61:13.07]Or I could go for the threes.
[61:20.83]Damn it.
[61:24.92]Yeah, get a little straight.
[61:28.40]Two, three, four.
[61:29.52]Let's try to get a little straight.
[61:34.86]Fuck.
[61:35.04]Fuck.
[61:36.86]It's such a ridiculous... It's such a high chance to get this, too.
[61:41.12]I need a 2?
[61:42.90]No, I need a 1 or a 5.
[61:45.78]Knocky knocky.
[61:47.56]Who's there?
[61:50.04]Don't do this to me.
[61:54.43]Thank God.
[61:56.53]I'm a really enjoy play with you.
[61:58.31]I was gonna say, you got two dice.
[62:05.07]I got it.
[62:22.32]Good.
[62:24.29]That's good.
[62:27.67]He's got really... His Full House was awesome.
[62:31.53]His Four of a Kind was really good.
[62:32.63]I need a good Four of a Kind.
[62:44.78]Or do I try to get the full house?
[63:05.57]Fuck yeah, come on.
[63:07.17]Yahtzee.
[63:09.83]Yahtzee.
[63:13.89]It's alright.
[63:15.33]Uhhh.
[63:17.41]I don't know if I four of a kind that, though.
[63:19.25]13 points!
[63:20.47]Lookit, he's got so much... I'm just gonna go with threes.
[63:24.22]Big straight.
[63:26.78]No?
[63:26.90]1, 2, 3, 4?
[63:27.04]Uhhh!
[63:45.15]Uh-huh.
[63:51.56]He's got great rolls here.
[63:52.82]This is bad.
[63:55.27]He's had four of a kind on his last three turns, I think.
[64:09.96]I've already got the straight.
[64:12.50]This is just an out-of-the-pocket straight, too.
[64:14.84]No, it's not.
[64:15.20]It is free.
[64:15.54]Do I just hold the two?
[64:20.74]I don't really want to hold the six.
[64:35.52]Hold the 5 and the 6.
[64:37.90]I mean, what?
[64:38.36]Just try to get a better, uh, choice?
[64:44.77]Try to get a big choice?
[64:45.63]Yeah, I see it.
[64:46.37]Yeah, that's true.
[64:46.89]Ohhhhhhhhhh.
[64:51.57]That's what I needed.
[64:52.39]That's exactly what I needed.
[64:56.25]Full house.
[64:57.43]Sixes and fives.
[64:58.79]I'll take it.
[64:59.31]Thank you.
[65:00.47]I'ma really enjoy playing with you.
[65:05.51]That felt good.
[65:14.57]Yeah, hold the five.
[65:15.41]That was... I wasn't gonna do that.
[65:20.16]I was gonna hold the twos and try to get some, you know, try to essentially throw the hand away.
[65:23.64]I got it.
[65:27.44]Mario's gonna put this on the aces line.
[65:33.30]Okie dokie.
[65:34.37]Your move.
[65:39.65]Still, either one of us can win.
[65:46.42]Not a bad choice.
[65:47.06]I can still do fours.
[66:02.29]That's also not a bad choice.
[66:05.29]I wonder if I just roll the three and do choice.
[66:13.26]That's what I'm gonna do.
[66:17.76]Or roll the fours, or roll the sixes.
[66:21.28]Yes, no, yes, no, no, no, yes, no, yes, no.
[66:23.51]Why?
[66:24.11]Just go for four.
[66:24.81]No, no, yes.
[66:31.43]Either hold the fours or hold the sixes.
[66:41.92]I should have just held that thing that I was doing and everybody yelled at me.
[67:04.74]Okay.
[67:07.12]Mad because bad, mad because bad, mad because, alright, I'm gonna do what I want now.
[67:12.46]If I have a question, I'm gonna ask it out loud, and I'm gonna cover up the screen, and I'm not gonna look.
[67:15.88]Fuck.
[67:19.90]What is that gonna be?
[67:20.62]21?
[67:27.57]Eh, if he wins by two points.
[67:28.93]I'll be very upset.
[67:45.75]Just going for the twos.
[67:52.11]Two, fuck.
[68:03.16]Not good at all.
[68:05.50]Okay.
[68:07.12]It's my turn now.
[68:17.20]I hate when you start with two or three sixes.
[68:24.06]Don't get four sixes.
[68:25.78]I need to get that.
[68:26.58]Oh, God.
[68:37.75]He just has a good... He's got great points.
[68:42.13]Not perfect points.
[68:43.09]He's just got great points for everything.
[68:48.11]That... Imagine if that was just 6, 6, 6, 6.
[68:55.68]Well, here's my opportunity.
[68:56.82]My turn.
[69:04.96]Come on.
[69:05.58]Don't... I... Don't do it.
[69:16.75]Yes.
[69:18.93]At least I matched them.
[69:19.71]Three, three, three, three.
[69:20.32]I need a four of a kind.
[69:22.06]Really, anything at this point.
[69:26.08]That's ballsy.
[69:47.90]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[69:52.95]Really?
[69:53.21]Give me a break.
[69:56.27]That's... That's unbelievable.
[70:07.54]Do I try to get four of Akane with the sixes?
[70:09.20]I think I do.
[70:12.02]Otherwise, what's the other play?
[70:13.57]The five?
[70:19.05]I have to go for it.
[70:28.97]Oh!
[70:29.45]It's what the sixes do!
[70:31.17]It's what the sixes do!
[70:38.56]Nice.
[70:42.92]He might just do that right now as well.
[70:46.36]Check.
[70:46.72]Watch this.
[70:49.09]Here comes two Fox.
[70:54.07]Not this time.
[70:54.61]That may have just completely screwed any chance he had.
[71:03.66]I might win by two or three points.
[71:19.79]Alright, now I have to play smart here.
[71:22.37]So we're just going to go fours.
[71:27.31]I'm just going for the fours.
[71:28.49]I'm going to try to get his minute just standard.
[71:30.57]Get good gameplay.
[71:31.61]Alright, that's not good, but it's alright.
[71:37.20]Just whatever it is.
[71:38.34]At least ten points.
[71:42.56]Whatever.
[71:43.26]Whatever.
[71:45.26]Just no zeros and I win.
[71:52.62]Can I hold the threes?
[71:59.80]He's in trouble.
[72:04.59]How is day... LOL, how is days gone?
[72:08.79]Um... Now, neither confirm nor deny how days gone.
[72:24.03]Um, four of a kind.
[72:25.23]Let's go for it.
[72:33.32]Fuck.
[72:35.42]Uh-oh.
[72:38.84]Uh-oh.
[72:43.82]Oh, yes.
[72:44.56]Alright.
[72:44.92]180.
[72:45.70]He gets a Yahtzee.
[72:47.40]He could win the game.
[72:54.13]Just no Yahtzee.
[72:55.19]No Yahtzee.
[72:55.71]No Yahtzee.
[72:56.25]No Yahtzee.
[73:02.75]He's not gonna get it.
[73:10.84]Game over.
[73:12.10]I beat him again.
[73:15.02]I did it!
[73:17.26]Mario done.
[73:19.04]Mario has been defeated.
[73:25.82]I need fives, and none of these are fives.
[73:42.80]220!
[73:44.46]Take the game and take the series.
[73:47.02]There it is.
[73:47.42]No, I win Mario, sorry.
[73:57.98]Sayonara, Mario.
[73:59.24]You're done.
[74:09.76]More, more, more.
[74:10.84]Goldfish?
[74:11.40]Alright, I'll do another... Okay, here's what's gonna happen.
[74:13.86]I'll do a goldfish.
[74:15.54]And then... I will call it for the night.
[74:20.26]Round of goldfish.
[74:24.28]That's a great game.
[74:32.72]Nice to see you again.
[74:35.92]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[74:36.86]I'm starting early tomorrow, by the way.
[74:38.26]I'm gonna go first.
[74:41.31]I started a couple hours early today.
[74:43.03]I'm starting at least a couple hours early tomorrow, too.
[74:47.51]Do you have any princess?
[74:49.07]Yeah, I'll just take all my cards.
[74:51.69]I'd like to have your koopas.
[74:56.32]Okay, so what do you wanna do tomorrow?
[75:04.08]I was under the impression that Days Gone was gonna be a game people wanted to watch.
[75:10.01]But I thought I was gonna do that for like a couple days.
[75:11.71]I don't think I am.
[75:15.59]What do we do tomorrow?
[75:16.65]You have any Luigi's?
[75:28.69]Last Guardian, I streamed all of The Last Guardian on stream.
[75:35.05]Alright, tomorrow might just be like a weirdo stream.
[75:49.70]Yeah, tomorrow, I'm gonna give you fair warning here, tomorrow's gonna be like a fuckface stream.
[75:57.91]Go fish?
[76:05.05]No, look.
[76:06.60]So every stream.
[76:07.58]No, what?
[76:08.16]You get another turn.
[76:09.94]Every stream?
[76:11.90]What about that time that I beat the last boss in Sekiro?
[76:13.96]That wasn't a fuckface stream.
[76:15.16]That was like a I did it stream.
[76:18.57]Go fish?
[76:23.42]Do you have any Goombas?
[76:26.26]Mario, go fish!
[76:28.74]Ah, I'ma guess I'ma go fishing.
[76:31.45]This is a fuckface stream.
[76:33.01]No!
[76:33.45]It's your turn.
[76:34.45]That's not true.
[76:37.23]The first, like, five hours of this stream was days gone, we're dead zero.
[76:42.47]Hold on.
[76:48.17]The first stream that you saw was days gone for five hours.
[76:52.37]So...
[76:56.58]That was just- I was just streaming that game.
[76:59.34]You can't- You can't really plan.
[77:07.13]A fuckface stream.
[77:09.23]But that's exactly what I just did for tomorrow.
[77:15.17]Play Sam & Max.
[77:15.73]Sam & Max is gonna be this weekend.
[77:17.83]We're gonna do MS DOS Night, again, and Sam & Max this weekend.
[77:22.62]I wouldn't do that on the weekend.
[77:24.12]You know, everyone's hanging out, just chilling on the weekend.
[77:28.10]Yes, I have one card.
[77:33.39]Okay.
[77:37.53]Go fish?
[77:38.55]I'm kicking his ass, so who cares?
[77:42.21]Please give me your Reap Van Fishy.
[77:46.30]I know you got those now.
[77:48.30]Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[77:50.24]It's your turn.
[77:58.02]Oh, fuck you.
[77:58.74]Yeah, he can have it.
[78:03.22]Nope.
[78:03.44]Oh, also, I'm gonna get Bushido Blade.
[78:06.82]I'm gonna get Bushido Blade 1 and 2.
[78:09.44]Those are those old-school, one-hit-kill, like, sword game.
[78:13.99]Like, samurai game, right?
[78:32.91]Those games apparently take an hour or two to beat the whole thing.
[78:37.21]So we're gonna try to do them both in the same night.
[78:39.17]Have you ever heard of Dragon's Dogma?
[78:43.96]I don't... I've never heard of it.
[78:45.22]Is it fucking fun?
[78:46.80]Just don't look for that.
[78:57.92]Come here fishy fishy.
[78:59.91]Here fishy fishy.
[79:01.63]It's your turn.
[79:07.79]Go fish?
[79:09.05]Let me pull a Mario out.
[79:12.49]Oh, it's a boo.
[79:13.47]I'd like to have your Luigi's.
[79:17.89]Play putt-putt?
[79:18.57]I played every putt-putt on screen at the same time.
[79:22.25]Like two years ago.
[79:24.79]Ah, I'ma guess I'ma go fishing.
[79:39.63]No, he's gonna ask for it.
[79:41.27]I'm gonna get it.
[79:43.63]I'm gonna get his whole stack.
[79:51.12]What about the Hotline Miami 2 Shrek campaign?
[79:57.41]Really?
[79:58.41]This is... I don't know.
[80:01.67]Tomorrow is just a total fuckface stream.
[80:04.09]It might happen.
[80:05.71]I'm just going to line up a bunch of random shit.
[80:07.38]Maybe we'll just do it.
[80:08.18]I don't know.
[80:08.56]But that one had like... There was like pornography in that one.
[80:11.02]Shit.
[80:13.08]Alright.
[80:22.89]I'd like to have your Goombas.
[80:26.31]I need a Goomba.
[80:26.77]Mario, go fish.
[80:28.77]Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[80:30.74]Sam and Max's this weekend?
[80:33.16]Yes, it is.
[80:36.90]It's your turn.
[80:41.06]Play the Jurassic Park game.
[80:42.26]Yo, you gotta have a Yoshi at this point.
[80:43.78]No, really?
[80:46.24]One to one.
[80:48.17]Do you have any Bigaboos?
[80:53.17]Do an episode of Sam & Max tomorrow.
[81:00.02]No, because I don't want to do like two hours of Sam & Max and then just do it.
[81:07.08]Nah, I'd rather do it this weekend.
[81:08.82]And then just do an episode into episode season three.
[81:14.31]You know, because I'm obviously just going to do them all.
[81:16.27]You still want to play?
[81:18.69]Go fish?
[81:19.27]You still didn't get that one.
[81:20.81]How?
[81:24.36]I'm fishing for Luigi's.
[81:28.37]Mario, go fish.
[81:30.41]Come here, fishy, fishy.
[81:32.37]Here, fishy, fishy.
[81:33.97]Okay.
[81:37.18]I keep thinking Mario.
[81:37.90]Yeah, because I keep thinking he's top decking Mario.
[81:41.20]Go fish.
[81:47.09]I'd like to have your... No, I need those.
[81:52.30]That's another book for Mario.
[81:56.84]I'm looking for Goombas.
[82:01.06]That's another book for Mario.
[82:05.60]Do you have any Bigaboos?
[82:08.74]Mario, go fish.
[82:11.00]Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[82:12.95]It's your turn.
[82:16.81]Give me your pearls.
[82:18.11]I have two cards.
[82:20.09]You definitely have a Mario now.
[82:26.59]Remember, this game's for five-year-olds.
[82:27.83]Don't lose.
[82:28.89]I'm not going to lose.
[82:31.57]Go fish?
[82:37.44]Do you have any koopas?
[82:39.56]No.
[82:40.36]Mario, go fish.
[82:41.04]I guess I'm going to go fishing.
[82:44.52]He's going to top deck it right now.
[82:46.56]Mario gets to go again.
[82:48.26]No, he's going to top deck it.
[82:49.97]Please give me your big booze.
[82:54.96]Top deck, Mario.
[83:00.34]Oh my god, what the fuck is going on here?
[83:04.65]He's definitely gonna fucking Mario now.
[83:14.87]Oh, I top decked it.
[83:17.99]Top deck for me.
[83:18.93]I'd like to have your Luigi's.
[83:25.97]I don't get to go again?
[83:26.67]Alright, what do you think?
[83:29.00]Yoshi's?
[83:29.40]No!
[83:30.14]Ah!
[83:30.26]He's gonna... No, he's gonna win.
[83:32.42]He's got five.
[83:38.02]I need... I need to...
[83:54.02]I'm looking for Luigi's.
[83:56.74]Give me all your Yoshis.
[83:57.82]Mario, go fish!
[83:59.42]Come here, fishy fishy.
[84:01.38]Here, fishy fishy.
[84:02.92]Okay.
[84:05.53]Go fish.
[84:06.35]What cards do you have right now?
[84:10.87]That's another book for you.
[84:12.81]I'm fishing for... Dick.
[84:17.49]...ball bombs.
[84:20.25]That's another book for Mario.
[84:26.36]Luigi's.
[84:28.36]Mario, go fish.
[84:30.44]Looks like it's time to go fishing again.
[84:32.38]Okay.
[84:37.14]Go fish?
[84:38.06]Why do you have a car?
[84:39.26]How many cars are left?
[84:42.20]Oh, I'm looking for Luigi's.
[84:45.27]Mario, go fish.
[84:47.25]Now I'm going to take them all.
[84:48.49]I guess I'm going to go fishing.
[84:53.14]Here comes a comeback.
[84:57.58]It's time to come back.
[84:59.84]Go fish?
[85:21.19]Give me a Yoshi.
[85:22.23]Don't ask for Yoshi.
[85:23.89]Don't ask for Yoshi.
[85:25.89]There's no way.
[85:28.31]Give me another Yoshi right now.
[85:32.09]Oh!
[85:32.27]You're bad at this game.
[85:33.69]You're not good at this game.
[85:35.79]Okay.
[85:53.32]That's another book for you.
[85:57.28]Hey, you won.
[85:58.78]I was planning that the whole time.
[86:07.59]I was just working it.
[86:14.85]Hey, how about another game with me?
[86:18.13]nope I'm getting up from the table hey Mario's game gallery that was fun
[86:29.12]No, I can't.
[86:30.08]I won't.
[86:30.34]I can't.
[86:31.20]I'll get, like, upset that I lose to him in checkers.
[86:33.06]So, no, I'm going to beat him in everything else.
[86:35.42]I will actually, like, suck and click random places in checkers and lose and be actually annoyed.
[86:39.61]And everyone will be in the chat going, like, Dude, are you serious?
[86:43.79]Like, are you... No, you're, like, kidding around.
[86:45.71]You, like, know how to play checkers.
[86:46.69]Like, you're not this stupid.
[86:48.07]And I'll be like, No, I... Ah, fuck.
[86:50.23]God damn it.
[86:50.83]I can... No, I just beat him twice.
[86:52.05]No, I'm going to exit the game.
[87:02.67]He's not joking.
[87:03.47]No, I'm not.
[87:04.79]I have no confidence when it comes to a board like a checkerboard anymore.
[87:09.59]I lost all.
[87:10.17]I'm like terrified to play it now because I don't want to click somewhere wrong and be stupid.
[87:15.52]But that's going to take us to the end.
[87:22.60]So tomorrow we are going to be starting.
[87:26.30]I'm going to edit the sus command.
[87:29.54]Tomorrow we start at around 1.30 this afternoon Pacific.
[87:35.02]Expect something like that again.
[87:37.24]Expect something like a noon to 1 p.m.
[87:40.92]Pacific.
[87:44.08]If you're wondering why this is.
[87:47.26]Why are you starting at like 12.01 the last couple of days?
[87:51.67]It's because somebody is coming in.
[87:55.44]To Vegas.
[87:56.91]And I have to get them at the airport.
[87:58.99]So I wanted to make sure I could get a stream in.
[88:04.89]Me!
[88:05.39]Yeah, that's right.
[88:07.95]No, not mom.
[88:08.93]No, but I'm not like taking... They're just kind of in town.
[88:11.88]They're just kind of passing through town.
[88:14.96]So I'm just going to hang out with them for like a day or two.
[88:18.56]So I've... It'll be as if I really like never left.
[88:21.72]I mean, obviously I'd be gone for like a day or two, but...
[88:26.48]So after tomorrow, I will see you guys on the weekend.
[88:30.86]Maybe we'll do Saturday and Sunday.
[88:32.73]Are you hanging out with Penn and Teller?
[88:39.79]I mean, they have a show here, but no.
[88:42.05]No.
[88:44.03]Tell us who.
[88:44.61]It's a secret!
[88:45.25]Maybe you'll see.
[88:46.99]It's not even a secret.
[88:48.49]But maybe, like, just keep an eye on, like, the Twitter.
[88:52.77]As of, like, Thursday.
[88:55.52]Because they'll probably do something.
[88:57.14]Maybe they'll be like a tweet.
[89:00.00]It's an old friend.
[89:01.74]Hello, old friend.
[89:07.13]Joe Vinny.
[89:08.75]No, no.
[89:13.41]No, no.
[89:14.53]You don't have to guess who it is.
[89:15.67]It's not even like a big deal.
[89:17.45]They're just coming to hang out for a day.
[89:22.11]He's meeting Sam and Max.
[89:23.49]Yeah, they're like two of my closest buddies.
[89:27.71]No, no, no, no.
[89:28.71]It's not... Alright, just look.
[89:32.09]Tomorrow, we'll go from like noon... I don't know, maybe even noon to six, maybe?
[89:38.35]Noon to five?
[89:39.51]Five or six hours?
[89:41.55]And then come back in the weekend and we'll do MS-DOS and Sam & Max.
[89:47.15]Tomorrow, I have no idea what the hell we're doing.
[89:48.73]It's gonna be a magical mystery ride.
[89:54.81]So, I mean, don't miss tomorrow's stream, but, like, if you do, it is just a Magical Mystery Ride stream, so who has any idea what you could be missing?
[90:03.22]I don't know.
[90:09.95]But, I will see you tomorrow.
[90:12.23]I'm not going to do... Alright, I'm not going to play GeoGuessr.
[90:14.83]No, we're going to do something else.
[90:17.59]Maybe I'll take, like, the personality test tomorrow.
[90:20.81]I don't know.
[90:21.33]We're just going to wing it.
[90:22.92]Completely.
[90:25.43]Subvert expectations.
[90:26.75]Yeah, I don't really have anything planned, so we're just gonna dick around.
[90:36.61]Do the Hogwarts test.
[90:37.74]I'll compile a few interesting things and we'll see.
[90:42.54]But, uh, let's do the bits.
[90:45.02]Thank you for hanging out.
[90:46.72]I did want to stream for at least six to seven hours, like usual.
[90:51.93]And here we are.
[90:55.49]Let us rewind the clock.
[91:00.14]Back to six and a half hours ago.
[91:03.88]To Atrolux Atrix for the 250.
[91:05.80]They say Bia simulator.
[91:09.34]It's a little skinnier than a Bia though.
[91:10.96]Skinnier.
[91:13.19]Thank you for the 250.
[91:14.93]Keldos thanks for the 250.
[91:16.89]Thanks Keldos for the 250 bits.
[91:18.33]They say thanks Keldos for the 250 bits.
[91:20.09]They say thanks Keldos for the 250 bits.
[91:23.23]That is what they said.
[91:25.78]Thank you, though.
[91:26.46]Thank you, Keldos.
[91:28.89]Thank you, Mr. Comcast, for the $3.
[91:32.20]Hey, Jerma John Comcast here.
[91:34.24]Just letting you know that I tried giving you $5,000, but the internet kept crashing before I could send the bits.
[91:41.02]Ah, well.
[91:42.24]In other news, I started using Tinder and got a match.
[91:44.98]So do you have any advice for an old boomer about what to talk about on first dates?
[91:48.46]Except for my overflowing wealth and amazing internet services.
[91:51.58]Of course.
[91:52.64]Thanks, Daddy-O.
[91:53.26]By the way, you should host another Pog Championship.
[91:57.52]Oh, we need to see more of that.
[91:58.62]PogChamp?
[92:00.32]PogChamp?
[92:01.58]Let's see it.
[92:10.66]Advice for dating?
[92:11.42]Just put on Iron Chef.
[92:14.22]If you're going on a date, just watch Iron Chef.
[92:16.18]I've gone on that rant before, but it's the best.
[92:22.50]Did I say something about putting an ice cream side up?
[92:26.98]Did I?
[92:29.12]Am I making that up in my head?
[92:37.81]I did say that, right?
[92:40.15]Yeah, I said I was gonna put like an ice cream up my ass.
[92:43.08]What?
[92:43.92]No, up like some... It was up their ass.
[92:46.78]Whose ass was it?
[92:49.76]I don't remember what that was.
[92:54.92]What?
[92:55.30]No.
[92:56.33]I don't remember.
[92:56.91]It was something stupid.
[93:03.01]It was a hypothetical... It was a hypothetical ice cream up...
[93:09.26]Well, that's where we're going to stop that one.
[93:11.68]Oh, lewd and crude.
[93:12.68]Thanks for the $5.
[93:13.54]You started the stream right in the middle of my brewing session making a stout.
[93:17.34]Give me a name for it.
[93:18.24]Let's see here.
[93:21.28]A stout.
[93:23.34]How about domino?
[93:30.65]Yeah.
[93:37.45]Domino.
[93:43.08]Literally, I'm sorry, but like... It's... It's the first thing I looked at.
[93:50.87]Mario was pointing... Yeah, he was pointing at it, so... No, you should name it... French.
[94:03.53]French.
[94:10.34]Don't name it any of those things.
[94:16.81]Name it French.
[94:18.57]French.
[94:20.53]No creativity streamer.
[94:22.23]I don't know.
[94:22.73]What do you name a beer?
[94:28.09]Just have it be like a series of numbers and letters.
[94:31.00]Just alphabetical.
[94:32.72]Like A26BBB15552.
[94:35.24]It's the batch number.
[94:38.66]And then underneath it write the secret batch.
[94:43.52]I would think that was really cool.
[94:49.74]If you handed me that bottle and I saw that label, I'd be like, wow, this is fucking something, this is something interesting here.
[94:56.75]Why, like, that printed, kind of stamped on alphanumerical label, there's gotta be something interesting going on here.
[95:03.07]This is a secret stash.
[95:06.47]It's the sacred, the secret batch.
[95:10.92]Uh, Smotherum just gave $50.
[95:14.50]5,000 bits from Smotherum.
[95:16.54]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks.
[95:19.72]It was up Shrek's ass.
[95:20.86]Don't question me.
[95:21.80]You said it.
[95:23.60]Well, you typed it.
[95:25.04]I read it.
[95:26.96]We're both equally at fault here.
[95:30.95]Thank you for the $50, though.
[95:38.01]That's a lot of money.
[95:38.67]Thank you, for real.
[95:42.87]But lewd and crude?
[95:44.80]Hope it tastes good.
[95:45.54]Hope it's a good stout.
[95:49.28]Thank you, though.
[95:50.66]Hey iPod, thanks for the $5 iPod, Matt.
[95:56.86]If you don't like the vibrations on your PS4 controller, all you need is a small Phillips screwdriver and some scissors.
[96:02.76]Unscrew the four screws on the back of the controller and pull the front and back shell apart.
[96:08.51]It may feel like it'll break, but it won't.
[96:10.65]Take the battery out of the basket and unscrew it from the motherboard.
[96:14.49]At the top of the controller, there's a thin cable plugged in.
[96:17.37]Unplug and tuck it back.
[96:18.49]Pull the plastic holding the motherboard
[96:21.19]And there are two motors on the plastic with wires soldered on the motherboard.
[96:24.49]Cut them and you will, like the weight, keep them there.
[96:29.49]If not, they're taped to the plastic.
[96:30.77]You have to use some force, but they'll pop out if you do put... I'm not gonna cut into my PlayStation 4 controller.
[96:43.81]Or you can just turn the vibration off in your PS4 settings.
[96:51.61]That was the end of that, by the way.
[96:54.75]I didn't read the end.
[96:55.51]I was sitting there going, like, there's no way anybody does that.
[97:01.07]Those things are, like, $60.
[97:02.29]Yeah, you could also, like, drop it off your roof, too, and it would probably mess with the vibration.
[97:12.46]But thank you, iPodBat, for the $5.
[97:14.39]And the DIY tip.
[97:17.80]Hey, the Jack.
[97:18.50]Thanks for the 250, Jack.
[97:20.54]You'll never hit me.
[97:21.20]You'll never hit my tiny head.
[97:22.90]It's so tiny.
[97:23.74]I've got a frickin' such a tiny little head.
[97:26.98]I do.
[97:28.38]I'm not afraid to admit that.
[97:29.98]I know that to be a fact.
[97:34.41]I know that to be a fact.
[97:43.03]Thank you to Son of Jenova for the 250.
[97:45.98]I mean, this is awesome.
[97:46.58]This is great.
[97:47.24]It's a great rat emote.
[97:47.78]But I think I've got something already.
[97:48.92]That's really good, though.
[98:15.90]Make it available now!
[98:21.32]I've got one that can be used for more than one occasion.
[98:25.48]It could be either.
[98:26.14]And of course I'm talking about Turbo C. There could be more than one option there.
[98:46.87]Dermacy.
[98:47.39]That's what it's gonna be.
[98:50.20]That is great, though.
[98:51.14]Thank you for that.
[98:53.56]Get rid of Saturn.
[98:54.50]I've never seen anybody use it.
[98:55.56]But that's... I can't get rid of Saturn.
[98:59.20]Thank you, Juno, for the 250.
[99:02.54]Colonel, I'm trying to sneak around, but I'm placed in a generic zombie game.
[99:06.30]And the sound of the rocks hitting the ground are alerting the Freakers.
[99:18.21]Thank you one black for the 250.

[100:19.65]Ah, thanks for the 30 bucks.
[100:21.87]Thank you, Bubble Base, or Bubble Bass, for the 10 bucks.
[100:25.23]Keep playing, you coward.
[100:26.57]I did.
[100:28.16]I played for a solid two or three hours after you wrote that.
[100:32.10]I did.
[100:32.76]I played for about five hours.
[100:35.16]I was having fun.
[100:37.10]But I did see the end of the tunnel there.
[100:39.00]I could see the light at the end of the tunnel.
[100:41.52]It was gonna be just kind of more of that.
[100:43.64]More of that.
[100:44.53]And more of that.
[100:47.12]I played for like... I played for like five hours.
[100:49.66]And then we played Mario, um... Gambling for like an hour and a half.
[100:53.83]We don't have to be too harsh on that game.
[100:59.87]I mean, it is like a generic... I was very harsh on it, never mind.
[101:03.31]I already was.
[101:05.42]I can't backtrack that.
[101:06.94]I said... I said like things that I cannot take back.
[101:09.94]Already.
[101:10.86]Already.
[101:15.02]You saw the light at the end of the tunnel, but had to push a pickup truck out of the way to get it.
[101:22.54]That was good.
[101:24.78]That was, that was like screenshot-worthy good.
[101:29.34]Seriously, that was unbelievable.
[101:33.42]Like, I can, I wish I could, I wish I could smell that comet, you know what I mean?
[101:36.12]I bet it would smell like fucking, like, vanilla.
[101:39.79]And like roses and shit.
[101:45.54]But thank you.
[101:47.91]I'm not a fucking crackhead.
[101:48.83]I was hit in the face with a shovel before though, like right in the head.
[102:10.69]I have taken a shovel to the face.
[102:12.50]The corner of a shovel went right into the corner of my eye.
[102:14.62]Like, up in my, like, forehead.
[102:16.60]Up on, like, the brow bone.
[102:18.44]When I was, like, 12.
[102:24.18]I'll tell you what happened now this is a very short story I was at my friend's house and we were outside in the snow without context somebody beat me in the face of the shovel right okay so let me give you context so I was at my friend's house and we were outside playing in the snow it was snowing out we were probably like 12 13 years old and um he had a little sister
[102:48.50]And his little sister was in the front door of the house.
[102:51.54]We were outside, and he had a shovel.
[102:53.85]And he's standing in front of the front door, maybe, I don't know, maybe 5 to 10, maybe 10 feet away from the front door.
[102:59.49]And he was taking big, huge, and this is one of those plow shovels, the big, heavy, fucked up ones that you stick on the ground and walk, and you plow forward, right?
[103:10.24]So what he was doing is he was picking up the snow, he flipped it upside down, he was picking snow up with the shovel portion,
[103:16.84]And she was opening the door and he was throwing snow at her to try to get into the house and hit her with the snow.
[103:26.05]So he's just shoveling throw.
[103:27.63]She was opening the door, closing the door, opening the door, closing the door.
[103:31.07]He was just trying to throw snow into the house.
[103:33.77]So I was on a sled just sitting behind him.
[103:36.63]And I don't know what, I don't understand how this happened.
[103:39.26]I really don't know.
[103:39.96]Like my memory doesn't form this for some reason.
[103:42.86]But I was sitting down or like sledding.
[103:46.28]Because he had a staircase, a little staircase that was covered in snow, and I was, like, kind of going down it, and, like, inching back, because he was maybe, I don't know, five feet in front of that.
[103:55.06]So I, like, sled down it, and, like, shimmied my butt forward, and I was getting way too close, because he wasn't paying attention to me.
[104:00.67]So on his backswing, he was getting close.
[104:03.49]And I guess just stupid 12-year-old me did not understand.
[104:07.25]But I just got too close, and on his big backswing to, like, throw the snow, he hit me right in the fucking face, right in the eye.
[104:16.61]And busted my forehead under- pretty much right where my brow bone meets my eye.
[104:22.55]It was just like BOOM!
[104:24.68]And my face just exploded with blood.
[104:33.44]And I had to get it like sutured up.
[104:36.50]There's actually- maybe you can still see it.
[104:38.75]I actually have like a line in my eyebrow.
[104:42.63]Let's see if we can find it together.
[104:44.33]Don't make fun of the shirt.
[104:45.49]I know you already will.
[104:49.59]So, which eye was it?
[104:52.48]Was it right here?
[104:54.24]Right there.
[104:54.54]I have like a hole in my eyebrow.
[105:05.64]Like right here.
[105:12.80]I didn't see that before, did you?
[105:15.56]Now you do.
[105:23.36]No, you're just gonna see it by my nose!
[105:28.42]God damn it.
[105:31.87]Ah, fuck.
[105:36.33]I see the hole that's down by your chin.
[105:43.48]Your career is over now.
[105:45.14]We saw your nose hairs.
[105:47.24]Fucking idiot.
[105:48.14]What am I thinking?
[105:49.88]I can't be trusted with a camera.
[105:53.17]A webcam.
[105:54.17]I can't.
[105:55.16]Do I have pants on?
[105:56.34]Yes, thank God.
[106:00.44]And I've got, like, wicked long nails.
[106:02.38]Fucking hell, this is why I can't do anything.
[106:06.20]I saw some flakes in there.
[106:07.40]Fuck, people are gonna, like, screencap and, like, zoom in and find, like, the boogers in my nose.
[106:13.74]I know, I already see these posts.
[106:16.50]You don't think they've, like, scrolled by, like, the Reddit before and seen, like...
[106:22.72]picture of like inside of my mouth and shit and like I need I need to like trim my nose hairs I need to do some like grooming I haven't done it why would I turn the camera on I gotta get a haircut whatever just who cares why do you care because I don't know I just do
[106:51.41]I like this W. You're too self-conscious.
[106:53.05]I'm just kidding.
[106:53.97]Half the time.
[106:54.41]Don't worry.
[106:57.35]I'm just kidding.
[106:57.87]I'm kidding.
[106:58.13]Don't worry.
[106:58.45]I really don't, like... Maybe, like, 30% of me is like, oh, shit, I have long nose hairs today.
[107:04.64]70% of me is like, fuck it, whatever.
[107:11.92]Half the time.
[107:14.49]He always cares.
[107:15.27]Don't listen to him.
[107:19.01]I look like such a psycho with this shirt on, though.
[107:21.47]But I like this shirt.
[107:22.29]And it was washed.
[107:22.98]It was cleaned from the last time you saw it.
[107:24.28]Don't worry.
[107:28.00]But anyways, let's move on.
[107:29.26]Almost done here.
[107:32.00]We have $5 from Impressions28.
[107:34.31]Here's $5 off a Visa gift card I don't know what to do with because you're a cool guy.
[107:41.95]Dermapop.
[107:44.95]Oh, $5 off of this.
[107:45.85]I thought you meant like a coupon for $5 off a gift card.
[107:58.10]Well, thank you for the $5.
[107:59.08]Appreciate the $5 from the Visa gift card.
[108:03.12]Hey, TheJack, thanks for the $2.50.
[108:03.94]Jeremy, you need to stop playing this.
[108:05.48]You would be banned by TOS because there's no gameplay and you're not in creative.
[108:09.60]Hmm.
[108:13.92]Thank you, Freudian weapon for the 250.
[108:15.30]If you're making balloon animals on stream, can I have a giraffe, please?
[108:24.16]Uh, I can only do snakes and small dogs.
[108:28.26]Nothing else.
[108:31.08]Hey, Cad, thanks for the 250.
[108:32.84]What flavor was the Gatorade before you ruined it with your piss?
[108:36.17]Uh, always blue or purple.
[108:40.23]Any of the hot colored Gatorades.
[108:47.16]I'm talking orange, red.
[108:48.78]Any of the, you know, the sun light spectrum.
[108:56.41]Any of the heat flavors.
[108:58.49]They're all terrible.
[108:59.59]Red just tastes like fucking old fruit punch.
[109:03.51]Orange tastes like battery acid.
[109:04.85]It's just acid.
[109:06.59]Yellow... Yellow just tastes like Sour Patch Kids that they grinded up and added water to.
[109:13.56]And then drained the water from the Sour Patch Kids mixture.
[109:18.68]It's awful.
[109:22.66]Blue...
[109:24.66]tastes fresh.
[109:25.96]Like, blue tastes like a nice fresh clean laundry blueberry.
[109:31.98]And purple is a nice deep, deep grape medicine flavor.
[109:37.92]Because all Gatorades are disgusting.
[109:40.43]They're all awful.
[109:42.01]And they're not, you should never drink them.
[109:53.37]But you should drink instead
[109:56.26]is water.
[109:58.24]With just a squeeze, just a squeeze of lemon.
[110:00.97]Just squeeze it in there and add like two or three tablespoons of salt.
[110:05.51]And like some tomato juice.
[110:08.19]And a celery stalk.
[110:11.73]And maybe some, maybe some, um, maybe some like hot sauce too.
[110:16.76]A little bit of vodka.
[110:18.82]And have a goddamn party.
[110:31.40]That's a terrible Bloody Mary.
[110:34.76]Nah, I used to drink Gatorade all the time.
[110:37.52]Not anymore, though.
[110:40.05]I used to be one of those dudes that just, on his nightstand, was a 32-ounce Powerade Purple.
[110:46.89]And I would just slam it right before going to bed.
[110:54.88]Back when... Yeah, I mean, if you... Okay, if you're, like, going to the gym and stuff, but...
[110:58.71]I used to do it, man.
[110:59.49]I used to drink Powerade and Gatorade just as a drink.
[111:03.65]Just when I wasn't working out.
[111:05.95]You kind of get addicted to them.
[111:09.25]Yeah, I would do it right before bed, too.
[111:20.27]How do I still have teeth?
[111:24.69]I don't know.
[111:27.63]I really don't know.
[111:30.37]Because these are made out of wood.
[111:33.35]Listen.
[111:38.77]Remember, um... George Washington?
[111:42.88]Yeah.
[111:44.44]Something we have in common.
[111:47.56]But...
[111:49.53]And then I would just retire.
[111:50.23]I would be it.
[111:50.65]Hey, remember the guy that retired by peeing into a bottle on stream?
[111:53.39]So, no, you're probably not going to see that.
[112:18.04]It wouldn't be banned.
[112:19.82]Those of you that are like, oh, you're going to get banned because of this.
[112:23.51]No, I would get retired because of that.
[112:26.49]Dude, did you see Jerma did a bunch of crazy shit?
[112:31.28]He got banned.
[112:32.08]Oh, he got retired.
[112:35.34]He's retired now.
[112:49.26]What happens after Twitch?
[112:50.32]Do you go to heaven?
[112:56.27]Uh, this is just like... I'm just in purgatory, I don't even know it.
[113:04.33]Hey, Clowercy, thanks for the 250.
[113:07.05]No IQ.
[113:08.65]I can't play three minutes of ads, people will leave.
[113:12.11]jermaIQ.
[113:13.53]Here's four plus hours of days gone.
[113:17.45]Yeah, but Days Gone is a video game.
[113:20.83]Ads are annoying breaks that you might see the same one about, like, Gillette Razors 30 times.
[113:31.92]An ad is not a game.
[113:33.76]An ad is not a stream.
[113:35.28]It's an annoying lapse in time.
[113:43.58]And you can't compare three minutes of ads to four hours of days gone.
[113:49.95]You would rather watch... No, no, no, I... You'd have to make that a little bit harder.
[113:54.83]It would be like 20 minutes of ads.
[113:58.59]Versus like, would be like the equivalent of four hours of days gone.
[114:01.73]No, it wouldn't.
[114:02.33]No, no, no, no, no, that's wrong.
[114:05.41]Long story short, whatever.
[114:08.16]You're speaking for us.
[114:09.36]I'm speaking for me.
[114:12.74]And you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you, and you.
[114:15.76]And there's still like a thousand people here that are agreeing with me.
[114:24.57]But thank you, uh, thank you GermanLightAboutGuey for the $3.50.
[114:27.63]Thank you Mr. Comcast for the $3.00.
[114:29.23]And also thank you to ClowersV for the $2.50.
[114:39.19]No one is agreeing with you.
[114:40.07]Yes, they are.
[114:41.64]I can just say they are.
[114:43.10]And then in my twisted narcissistic brain, it's real.
[114:48.46]Somebody just said, yeah, yeah, I agree, I agree.
[114:51.01]And I can just twist it into my narcissistic, sick fucking brain.
[114:57.21]As long as I say it, it's real.
[115:09.48]Sicko.
[115:12.54]But thank you, Mr. Comcast, for the $3.
[115:14.10]Hey, Jerma John, Comcast here.
[115:16.00]Heard that you're having internet problems.
[115:17.46]Yeah, I mean, they were annoying for a little while, yeah.
[115:20.51]That sucks.
[115:20.99]Luckily for you, we here at Comcast are the best internet service.
[115:24.71]I'm not actually... I don't want to read that out loud because it's not true.
[115:28.78]uh would be happy to welcome you into welcoming into our welcoming family for the price of your soul and dignity in other news have you seen my watch it must have fell off my arm when I tried crawling through your window to get into your house it's worth five million dollars I really need it back thanks cutie uh well my watch now finders keepers that is a law
[115:51.52]I just have to wait.
[115:52.72]When did you say this?
[115:54.12]This is two hours ago.
[115:55.26]Finders Keepers is, you have to wait like an hour.
[115:57.36]And if nobody claims it in an hour, it's yours.
[116:01.34]Didn't we already talk about this?
[116:05.74]If, okay, but, can we, I want to revisit this for a second.
[116:09.08]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[116:10.26]Remember that if you find a briefcase on the side of the road with a million dollars cash in it, what do you do?
[116:17.38]Do you turn it in?
[116:19.13]What's the time frame where it's yours?
[116:22.46]Everybody thought I was crazy when we were talking about this.
[116:29.81]Do you return like $790,000?
[116:30.85]And say I found $800,000 in cash on the side of the road?
[116:33.07]What do you do?
[116:50.65]Yeah, but how would you return it?
[116:51.63]I feel like people have this image in their brain of... If you walked into a police station with a million dollars in a briefcase... Hey, I filed this and I'm returning it.
[117:04.74]Is that... I don't even know if that would be... Who do you call?
[117:09.83]You have to call somebody.
[117:22.84]He called the Ghostbusters.
[117:24.03]Anyone would claim it.
[117:24.89]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[117:26.97]You'd have a line out the door of people telling it was theirs.
[117:32.43]I don't know.
[117:33.51]Hey, I found a briefcase on the side of the road that had $250,000 in it.
[117:36.14]I'm not sure what to do.
[117:36.90]$500,000 goes to charity and you keep like $150,000.
[117:39.30]Right?
[117:39.56]Would that make sense?
[117:52.97]It wouldn't be worth the trouble.
[118:00.17]Sit on it for a year just in case someone comes looking for it and is ready to kill.
[118:04.06]Like that you got like the secret briefcase from the movie.
[118:10.18]That never happens.
[118:12.11]How come we never see that shit in the movies?
[118:14.05]When they do the briefcase swap.
[118:15.93]There's a million dollars in cash in here and we just change the briefcase and do the exchange.
[118:20.18]How come there's not some random dickhead that like thinks it's their bag and they pick it up?
[118:27.30]And they just go home.
[118:36.05]That's literally the plot of a movie.
[118:39.25]Oh.
[118:45.29]That was in Mr. Bean.
[118:57.52]Literally the plot of a Mr. Bean episode.
[118:59.42]But what does he do?
[119:01.74]Does he donate some to charity and keep a bunch and then like throw the rest out the window?
[119:12.27]I think so.
[119:16.50]I'll take $200 cash, please.
[119:22.63]Does he talk like that?
[119:23.87]Yes, he does.
[119:29.58]He talks like that.
[119:30.66]Don't tell me that shit.
[119:33.92]Yes, he does.
[119:36.45]Bean, great English art scholar, is here to speak for a few minutes, not too long, doctor, on the subject of our new purchase.
[119:44.51]Ladies and gentlemen, the Dean of the National Gallery of Art.
[119:47.69]Here it comes.
[119:51.18]Look, I'm Dr. Bean, apparently.
[119:57.32]Fuck, he doesn't talk like that.
[120:00.68]And as I've learned...
[120:03.64]by staying with my best friend.
[120:10.12]No, no, this is bullshit.
[120:12.16]Because this is from his, like, movie.
[120:14.38]He had to talk in his movie.
[120:15.42]He couldn't be Mario anymore.
[120:18.26]In the TV show Mr. Bean, he would always just be like... He'd be like... He did that shit.
[120:28.91]He didn't talk in the show.
[120:34.85]In his movie, he had to talk.
[120:41.25]And there was just a laugh track that played.
[120:49.34]Hey, but thank you, Cad BTV.
[120:51.50]For the 250, when can we expect to see Jerma985 in Mario Yahtzee Esports?
[120:55.62]You already saw it.
[120:56.26]I already took the championship.
[120:58.73]Thank you, though.
[120:59.89]Hey, Luden Crew, thanks for $4.10.
[121:01.85]Thank you, Luden Crew.
[121:02.66]There's no message here, but just $4.10.
[121:04.34]Thank you.
[121:09.86]Thank you, Tibetan Hover Craft for the $3.
[121:12.62]Hey, Germany, if you're looking for things to try tomorrow, you might consider Twitch Sings.
[121:17.13]If you're not familiar, here's a video from my friend doing it.
[121:21.01]Oh, I know what it is.
[121:24.23]I think I would embarrass myself, though.
[121:31.11]I would embarrass myself.
[121:34.89]Sounds great.
[121:35.95]Sounds like fluff fun.
[121:39.19]And you don't usually.
[121:40.11]No, I'm usually fucking people go like sick, dude.
[121:42.41]What would you just say?
[121:43.87]Nice, man.
[121:45.65]I agree with everything he said.
[121:48.17]He's fucking so cool.
[121:51.60]I didn't even think about it like that.
[121:52.66]That's a really smart thing to say or do.
[121:57.08]Oh, that's an intuitive way to use that mechanic.
[122:04.64]I mean, that's what I hear, so... Hey, Daddy-O, thanks for the 1, 2, 3, 4, 5 dollars here.
[122:14.95]Thank you.
[122:16.43]Smotherum gave the 50 bucks.
[122:19.55]Thank you.
[122:20.81]Huge, huge 5,000-bit donation here.
[122:25.42]Talking about Shrek's ass.
[122:28.16]Thank you.
[122:30.60]Thank you absolutely not for the 15 dollars...
[122:34.72]You were the third channel I ever subscribed to on YouTube seven years ago.
[122:39.25]I loved all your videos and was sad to see you disappear from the main channel.
[122:42.73]Didn't realize you swapped to streaming after I found your second channel, and I'm so glad I found you again.
[122:47.44]Because you always have provided the most wholesome, enjoyable content.
[122:51.80]Much love.
[122:55.86]Yeah, I love all the time I spent on YouTube.
[123:00.82]It was great.
[123:02.40]It's some of the... It's honestly some of the most unbelievable years of my life that I've ever had.
[123:15.54]Not to say that this is not the same, but I have a ton of incredible memories of making those videos more than seven to eight years ago.
[123:27.95]Six years ago, eight years ago, five years ago.
[123:31.56]It was, it meant everything to me.
[123:33.56]It was my life.
[123:34.84]It still kind of is.
[123:36.94]Right?
[123:41.12]The people remember you from the server still.
[123:42.88]Yeah.
[123:43.92]Good.
[123:48.46]But I, if somebody's been around for that long, that's like an entire, that's a major, a whole portion of your whole life.
[123:59.44]If you have been watching this channel, if you subscribed that long ago and you watch the videos and... That's a lot of time.
[124:11.37]Why do you shit on your old videos?
[124:12.57]No, I tease my old videos.
[124:16.73]I love every video I've ever made.
[124:18.18]I really do, except for a couple of them.
[124:22.64]There's at least like a handful of low effort videos that I kind of just threw out there that I'm not happy with.
[124:29.54]But for the most part, like 99% of every upload I've ever put on YouTube, I... I thought that it was great.
[124:38.15]I loved every second of it.
[124:43.49]And then Twitch is kind of the... You know, I've been doing it for... How many... When did I start streaming?
[124:50.34]Actually streaming.
[124:51.40]And I was a streamer.
[124:53.86]A fake streamer.
[124:55.32]Back in like 2012. 2012.
[124:58.37]I streamed on Twitch.
[125:00.53]I streamed on YouTube.
[125:02.89]Not all the time, but maybe like once a month, once every few months I would stream.
[125:12.76]No, I never on JustinTV.
[125:14.62]Did I?
[125:15.24]Maybe one or two.
[125:24.34]Maybe like once on JustinTV.
[125:31.70]But this is another, like, next step, you know, of just continuing to do what I like to do.
[125:39.09]I know a lot of people are sad and, you know, oh, I miss those videos.
[125:43.85]I wish you would make them again.
[125:44.77]Yeah, you know, part of me says the same thing.
[125:49.97]But it's kind of, it's kind of, it's kind of just did it.
[125:53.04]I'm kind of done with that.
[125:57.72]This platform is kind of what I enjoy to do.
[126:00.72]And there's things I want to try with it.
[126:02.94]Which you've seen some of them already.
[126:08.77]And what's next?
[126:09.57]I don't know.
[126:14.28]I have no idea.
[126:15.18]I could never answer that question.
[126:20.82]But let us get the credits on the screen of all the subs from tonight.
[126:25.96]Or today.
[126:26.50]Yeah, it's only 8.
[126:27.12]Yeah, we're ending early.
[126:28.04]I forgot.
[126:30.70]It's been 7 hours and... Yeah, it feels weird that it's like 8.30.
[126:34.99]Usually it's like 10 or 11.
[126:36.93]Interesting.
[126:40.03]Holy fuck, there were a lot of subs.
[126:48.40]Oh, thank you guys.
[126:49.26]This is a shitload.
[127:00.61]You guys are awesome.
[127:04.45]Some of you guys tell me that you've been watching for years, and some of you guys have been paying this channel money for years.
[127:12.13]It all... It all boggles my mind sometimes, and it'll like now.
[127:19.70]See, it's really easy just to kind of forget, and just, oh yeah, we're just streaming today, whatever, what am I gonna stream today?
[127:26.77]This community has been large and fun and interesting for a long time.
[127:31.70]And I can't believe still, this many years later.
[127:38.06]We still have a couple more bits to do.
[127:39.26]But yeah, thanks.
[127:43.97]This is a lot of fucking fun.
[127:45.23]I hope it still is for you.
[127:46.27]And when it's not, like I've said in the past, then I don't want to put pressure on it having to be.
[127:57.92]You know?
[128:00.48]If it's not fun anymore, it's not worth doing.
[128:04.88]You could pay me a fucking million dollars.
[128:09.75]Hold on.
[128:11.07]Maybe like a... I don't know.
[128:11.95]Wait a minute.
[128:14.76]Wait, hold on.
[128:15.22]Let me know that I'm not talking to you so soon about that.
[128:21.86]No, I... I can't, like, pretend to, like, have fun.
[128:30.10]Not very many people can, I don't think.
[128:32.88]But... I'm just gonna keep doing it while it's still fun.
[128:37.64]And I still enjoy pretty much 99% of every stream is just fun to do and fun to be around a community of people that also think things are fun, that think the thing I'm doing is fun, that think the thing is cool that they're seeing or that they're participating in.
[128:54.63]What was the 1% Skate 3?
[128:56.31]And Karazin.
[128:58.31]And Mario Tennis.
[129:00.93]That makes up like 1%, or like .4% or something.
[129:15.70]Your transparency and honesty vastly outweighs the parts of your stream I dislike, of which there are quite a few.
[129:21.90]That's powerful.
[129:22.68]We don't like the streams.
[129:28.25]well I I don't really have I don't really have an answer for that you know what I mean I I if you if you think that a bunch of stuff on the stream is like not funny or not fun that I all I can do is try right all I can do is like
[129:52.09]All I can do is just put forth the thing that I think is gonna be fun, and if it's not, then if you don't think so, then I can't, like, change your mind, you know?
[130:07.01]And look, I'm not gonna be... I'll be completely honest here.
[130:10.40]There are some times that I know something's not fun.
[130:15.00]And I try to make it fun, try to change it a little bit, try to change the subject, try to move on from something.
[130:20.23]You know what I mean?
[130:21.23]It's kind of like the nature of live broadcasting for more than six, seven, plus eight hours at a time.
[130:29.49]I'm always trying to make it fun.
[130:32.81]And I can't convince somebody that what I'm doing is funny or interesting or cool for you or fun for you.
[130:43.25]If you make that decision for yourself, then what am I going to tell you that you're wrong?
[130:47.81]I can't do that.
[131:02.83]I'm forcing you to watch this.
[131:12.34]No, I'm not trying to, you know, jump on a comment that somebody makes, but... I am not, like, upset by that most of the time.
[131:30.46]Because I know, okay, if I was watching somebody and I didn't think they were interesting or I didn't like a lot of the things they were doing...
[131:37.12]If that person were to tell me that what I thought was wrong, then I would say, well, you're not me.
[131:43.95]You don't know that.
[131:48.33]Right?
[131:53.10]Not every streamer is for everyone.
[131:54.58]It's all good.
[131:55.20]Yeah, it's all good.
[131:56.44]That's cool.
[132:03.25]If you're taking it too seriously, you're the only streamer I never miss a stream for.
[132:05.89]If I didn't like you, I wouldn't spend so much time here.
[132:08.23]Well, I appreciate your honesty.
[132:13.68]So, thank you.
[132:15.02]I hope you enjoy the streams when you do come.
[132:27.94]No, every stream is for me.
[132:31.13]No, but just, that's...
[132:33.15]We've had kind of, you know, not streaming, just Jeremy's talking.
[132:41.93]Right?
[132:44.15]And... I'm just trying to make him fun.
[132:48.01]That's all I can do.
[132:49.79]If I fail, I fail.
[132:51.30]At least I'm trying.
[132:53.82]At least I'm trying while I'm here.
[132:58.80]This used to be a Days Gone stream.
[133:04.55]And not every stream, look, another thing, not every stream am I like, oh, I gotta make sure something's fucking hilarious and crazy and fun and it's gotta be funny.
[133:12.94]Fuck.
[133:14.10]For the most part, when we talk about that, it's like a joke.
[133:23.23]What about that clown car stream?
[133:28.09]You'll see that in a little bit.
[133:31.44]In like less than five years, you'll see it.
[133:33.32]Within five years.
[133:42.93]You couldn't care about Days Gone, but you liked that I was streaming it.
[133:46.70]Well, thank you.
[133:49.60]Again, like I said, if somebody... You know, people telling me how awesome the streams are and how much fun they are and how happy they are being here, it's great.
[134:04.65]It really is.
[134:08.10]But I don't also want to then... I never want stuff like that to inflate who I think I am.
[134:15.27]Or who I want to be, right?
[134:16.81]I don't want my ego or my narcissism to take over and it's like, oh, look at how great I am.
[134:25.88]I'm perfect.
[134:26.40]Everyone's wrong when they say anything bad.
[134:33.14]So sometimes people say, well, you're taking yourself too seriously here.
[134:38.00]You're too self-conscious.
[134:39.16]It's because I want to stay grounded on certain things.
[134:53.83]That's why we bully you.
[134:55.67]No, no, that's not why.
[134:58.53]That's why we bully you.
[135:07.43]You're grounded.
[135:10.05]No, but it's... I'm still having a fucking ton of fun.
[135:15.73]I would not be able to sit here.
[135:18.47]For seven fucking hours.
[135:20.29]Six to eight hours every time.
[135:23.05]If I didn't think it was fun.
[135:24.64]I wouldn't be able to sit here for 45 minutes if I didn't think it was fun.
[135:27.32]Uh-oh.
[135:33.44]Are we dead?
[135:34.22]No, we're alive.
[135:35.22]We're here.
[135:38.77]But we're going to... Two more.
[135:52.88]Oh, three more.
[135:53.36]Oh, I can look up more than that.
[135:56.36]We got on a little tangent there.
[135:57.56]Hopefully we're still live.
[136:02.01]Yeah, two... 29,000 drop frames.
[136:05.49]Damn, over seven hours, that's...
[136:09.30]uh that is like just barely barely tolerable that's just at the point where it's tolerable but really annoying I gotta get on top of this and try to get this fixed but uh speaking of that hey Mr. comcast thanks for the 250.
[136:32.92]So I took my five-year-old child, Jeremy Elbertson, to get an ice pop of his favorite master of comedy, Jerma985.
[136:39.14]When he got his ice pop, he started screaming at the other children about how he's going to crash the bald coin market with his sick stock trading skills.
[136:47.10]Sadly, his ice pop melted in his hand as he talked.
[136:50.92]The result of the ice pop looked like what can only be described as Jerma's face being randomized too many times in the Dark Souls character creator.
[137:05.67]Yeah.
[137:07.21]I love that.
[137:07.87]That's, like, my favorite emote.
[137:09.15]Can I just tell you?
[137:11.95]I love that emote.
[137:13.55]I love it.
[137:13.99]I think it's fun.
[137:17.95]I want to eat it, too.
[137:20.23]I want to eat that emote.
[137:22.33]In particular.
[137:26.23]But thank you, Mr. Comcast.
[137:27.07]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $2.50.
[137:28.56]Nice shirt and nose hairs.
[137:30.40]Just zoom in on them and get it over with.
[137:33.26]Thank you, though.
[137:35.80]Thank you, Tibetan Hovercraft again for the three dolls.
[137:37.54]Have you ever considered listening to Firesign Theater?
[137:42.74]I've never heard of them.
[137:43.54]If not, I highly recommend checking them out.
[137:45.02]Their comedy seems very in line with your sense of humor.
[137:49.90]I've never heard of them before.
[137:55.08]Might do a little bit of a YouTube search today after the stream.
[137:59.68]See what they're all about.
[138:03.48]But thank you for the recommendation.
[138:07.64]Splarg gave five community subs earlier.
[138:09.82]Thank you, about 20 minutes ago.
[138:11.12]Thank you, Splarg.
[138:12.28]Appreciate that.
[138:16.04]Just a five sub drop stealthily at the end of the stream.
[138:20.99]Thank you.
[138:23.33]All Mewthinks for 10 bucks.
[138:24.43]Hey, Jerma, I would take the effort to make a made-up story about how you did some cruel and absolutely insane crime against humanity that you would then deny above all else.
[138:32.17]But we all know what happens to those who expose the truth.
[138:36.29]Okay, yes.
[138:38.60]There we go.
[138:40.10]That was better.
[138:49.48]Thank you, AllMute, for the $10 and your cryptic message here.
[138:53.04]Thank you.
[138:55.88]Thanks for the $10.
[138:58.88]Thousand bits.
[139:03.58]From AllMute.
[139:06.30]250 came in from JermaLiedAboutTacoBell.
[139:08.34]Which videos are your least favorite?
[139:10.46]All the Modern Warfare 3 videos.
[139:13.88]All of them.
[139:15.01]Except for Grandpa.
[139:17.29]And there was like seven or eight of them.
[139:22.63]Hey, Devakitty, thanks for the 250!
[139:26.00]Jerma, I love your streams.
[139:26.94]You make anything worthwhile watching.
[139:28.34]I want to watch every stream, but as is evident by what time it is for me, I have to stay up to like six in the morning to watch you since you started like two for me.
[139:37.59]Jerma Hart.
[139:39.23]Oh, yeah, that's... It's always tough and... Really, whenever I start a stream, there's always gonna be some group of people that aren't able to do it.
[139:53.56]If I start at 2 p.m., if I start at 4 p.m.
[139:56.88]or 11 a.m., there's always somewhere around the world that I cannot watch.
[140:06.89]But there honestly is not much I can really do.
[140:13.65]I wish that I could kind of have my stream broadcast out at everyone's current time zone.
[140:19.84]But if it's one or two o'clock in the afternoon where I am, where I live, that's just... I can't, like, rotate the Earth.
[140:34.61]So I really, realistically, it is just the way it is.
[140:51.28]Because some places it's like 14, 15, 16, like 17 hours ahead.
[140:56.18]Or like 14 hours ahead.
[141:04.41]As a Brit, ruining my sleep schedule and watching your stream is one of my guilty pleasures whenever I have time off university.
[141:12.16]I'm glad that you've chosen my stream to just chill and watch whenever you can, if you want to, you know?
[141:21.01]It's... And that's another kind of thing about live broadcasting.
[141:27.40]With a seven, eight hours of stream, it goes through the whole day.
[141:35.02]If it's 1 p.m.
[141:36.14]and I start and I stop at, you know, 9 p.m.,
[141:40.31]It goes through a whole day, a whole period.
[141:43.99]You don't have to catch the whole thing.
[141:45.46]If you catch a couple hours or something, that's fine.
[141:49.32]I'm not... It's hard to sit here.
[141:52.76]A movie that you go to the theater for, the longest ones ever in history, are three hours and 35 minutes.
[142:06.24]Like the extended edition of Lord of the Rings is like three to four hours.
[142:12.41]That's like watching two back-to-back extended Lord of the Rings movies.
[142:20.11]No?
[142:21.19]It's how long is the extended Lord of the Rings?
[142:31.29]The average Marvel movie is four hours.
[142:33.47]No, it's not.
[142:35.34]four hours?
[142:43.52]I got it right.
[142:44.98]It's like about four hours.
[142:49.22]But my point is that it's a long time.
[142:52.57]It's a lot of time.
[142:56.11]So don't feel bad if you can't catch streams, or if you catch a little bit of the VODs, or if you check it out on the second channel.
[143:02.95]I mean, obviously I love when people are here, but
[143:06.32]Live, obviously, but it's a long time.
[143:09.83]I can't expect anybody to be able to book their entire day and watch the stream.
[143:15.53]And if you do, then I hope you fucking like the whole thing and I hope you have a lot of fun.
[143:18.33]It's a long time.
[143:28.79]I only love the people that are here live.
[143:31.29]There could not be further from the truth.
[143:36.24]But almost at the end here.
[143:37.86]And then I will see you guys tomorrow early afternoon.
[143:43.90]Thank you to JermaLiedAboutTacoBell again for $2.60.
[143:46.25]What flavor is jermaPop?
[143:48.29]It is the side of the freezer scrapings.
[143:52.49]With a hint of vanilla and lemon.
[143:58.95]And if you put it up and you smell it, if you get it close to your face and you smell, it smells like windshield washer fluid.
[144:07.30]That Freon vanilla smell.
[144:19.51]I'll take two, please.
[144:26.09]I would eat it.
[144:26.49]It's gonna be alright.
[144:28.73]It won't kill you.
[144:34.47]Uh, thank you Hike Zero for the 250.
[144:36.47]They say, here you go.
[144:37.71]Okay, here you... Oh my god.
[144:41.67]What fucked up, like, British Saturday morning cartoon is this?
[144:53.26]I feel like... I'm gonna fly by in a Monty Python movie and scream at somebody.
[145:11.22]But that's gonna be it.
[145:13.15]I'll see you guys tomorrow somewhere around like 12 to 1 p.m.
[145:18.05]maybe?
[145:18.31]Around like 12 to 2.
[145:21.31]I will set the sus accordingly later tonight.
[145:24.33]But somewhere around like that 12 to 2 p.m.
[145:27.06]Pacific.
[145:30.76]We'll see what we come up with tomorrow.
[145:32.04]Should be some fun.
[145:34.10]Take care, everybody.
[145:34.74]See you soon.
[145:36.62]Have a great rest of your night.
[145:39.09]Ta-ta.
[145:45.72]Stream legends, that's right.
[145:46.72]I forgot.
[145:47.62]Let's do it.
[145:53.41]You guys ready?
[145:53.85]You want your loot?
[145:57.89]Here it comes.
[145:59.55]Three, two, one.
[146:01.82]Legendaries all around.
[146:03.40]To, like, maybe two of you.
[146:07.38]Take care, guys.
[146:07.76]See you soon.
