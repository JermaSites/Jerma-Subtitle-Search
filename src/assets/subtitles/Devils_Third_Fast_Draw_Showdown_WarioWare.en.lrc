[00:00.77]You guys might have seen the last time I played.
[00:05.15]You know what?
[00:06.75]We're all here.
[00:07.39]Let's just fucking go, you know?
[00:13.00]Here we are.
[00:17.16]At least I think we are.
[00:17.88]Hey, there it is.
[00:23.08]So I opened up my Wii menu and I saw that I had like a shitload of games.
[00:28.04]on my actual Wii, not the Wii U. So we might check those out a little later, depending on how bad Devil's Third is, which it could be very bad.
[00:38.61]I don't have that much confidence that this is going to be a fun game.
[00:42.72]But you know, I've been wrong before.
[00:48.68]Where did my thing go?
[00:49.64]There it is.
[00:50.96]Hey, thank you, Scruffington.
[00:56.91]And... We haven't even started.
[00:59.57]I just turned the stream on.
[01:01.81]And there's a hundred... A ten thousand bit.
[01:04.35]A hundred bucks.
[01:05.83]From Dr. Screwball Jones.
[01:07.13]On time.
[01:07.99]Did I... Did you just give me a hundred dollars for being on time?
[01:13.70]I should show up on time more often.
[01:16.03]You know what I'm saying?
[01:16.73]I should show up on time a little more often.
[01:19.39]I don't even know what to say.
[01:20.49]Thanks, man.
[01:21.07]Thanks for the $100.
[01:22.41]Wait, what?
[01:24.37]How tall is my me?
[01:27.68]We'll talk about that in a minute.
[01:29.92]I have some actual photo evidence proof that needs to come to the light of day here.
[01:38.56]But thank you, Dr. Screwball Jones, for the 100 fucking dollars.
[01:43.41]That's very generous of you.
[01:44.27]Thank you so, so, so much.
[01:47.59]And also welcome back to Dr. Dadma for four months.
[01:50.47]Can't wait to see the Wii games.
[01:51.39]Me either.
[01:52.79]Me either.
[01:53.17]What do you say we just go?
[01:56.65]I already got the tweet out.
[01:57.33]I'm already moving, right?
[02:00.69]Already moving around.
[02:01.57]Not a big deal.
[02:08.51]Okay.
[02:14.37]So let's see.
[02:15.35]Can I play this with just a Wii mode?
[02:16.67]I don't know.
[02:20.09]And this is really fucking loud.
[02:22.62]As usual, right?
[02:29.84]Alright, I get it.
[02:32.20]And how come I can't hear the Twitch alerts anymore?
[02:34.94]That's not cool.
[02:41.48]wait what am I supposed to be hearing something where did my audio go is your guy supposed to be talking right now
[03:11.63]All right.
[03:13.27]Okay.
[03:20.52]Speaking of... Let's go.
[03:26.88]Oh, wait.
[03:27.32]Hold on a second.
[03:29.19]Hold on.
[03:30.47]Oh, yeah.
[03:31.03]I got the game pad plugged in.
[03:33.83]All right.
[03:34.37]That's what it was.
[03:36.55]I'm sorry.
[03:37.17]Opening cutscene.
[03:37.87]We'll watch it.
[03:38.65]Why not?
[03:44.22]That wasn't the cutscene.
[03:44.94]That was just a boat.
[03:46.50]That was just a boat.
[03:47.96]Okay.
[03:51.98]Hold?
[03:52.30]What do I have to hold?
[03:53.06]Oh, that.
[03:59.17]Please look at the gamepad.
[04:04.51]I'm trying.
[04:05.43]Alright, there we go.
[04:10.73]Please look at the gamepad.
[04:15.22]What are you trying to tell me to do, man?
[04:19.92]Okay, go.
[04:21.78]What the fuck?
[04:23.82]Turn up the brightness.
[04:25.28]These games are always too dark, right?
[04:28.38]That looks alright.
[04:32.00]Okay, no, please.
[04:35.16]I hate holding this giant brick in my hand.
[04:38.50]Vertical area, that looks fine.
[04:40.98]Solo play.
[04:41.80]Oh, here's the joke, guys.
[04:42.74]You ready for the joke?
[04:43.30]You guys want to play multiplayer in Devil's Third?
[04:48.80]Here we go.
[04:50.84]Connecting to server.
[04:52.20]Here's the joke everybody was waiting for.
[04:53.76]Let's see what it says.
[04:56.36]The online service is no longer available.
[04:58.16]Sorry.
[04:59.42]Yeah, because they turned it off yesterday.
[05:05.22]But holy shit, Javelin YT.
[05:08.46]Javelin YT with the 50 bucks.
[05:09.61]Thanks a lot for the 50 fucking dollars, Javelin.
[05:12.03]Are we starting the money train?
[05:14.61]Uh, well, we just started, so... Somebody gave 100, you gave 50.
[05:18.49]I guess it's already gone.
[05:22.59]Oh, yeah.
[05:22.93]Hilarious, right?
[05:23.59]Yeah.
[05:25.31]They turned it off, like, last night.
[05:27.21]So... But thank you for the bits, dude.
[05:31.72]Appreciate it.
[05:33.85]All right.
[05:34.67]Options.
[05:35.19]I don't think we really need to do much here.
[05:37.55]Rumble off.
[05:39.09]Cover.
[05:39.73]All these things are staying on.
[05:42.67]Audio.
[05:44.65]Might be a tad too loud.
[05:47.47]Can always change it back if we need to.
[05:50.39]Thank you, Lumped Milk.
[05:51.15]Here's to the world's best Pac-Man player coming back to the Wii U. It's been a long time, but, you know, I'm... I'm back.
[05:57.72]All right.
[06:00.04]Save it.
[06:00.40]Whatever.
[06:00.70]Let's just go.
[06:04.06]But thank you, Lump Milk.
[06:07.16]Wait, what?
[06:09.12]Okay, let's play.
[06:10.34]We have to do solo play.
[06:12.24]Why would anybody even be playing this game online?
[06:16.23]Opening cutscene.
[06:17.41]Finally.
[06:17.71]It only took us a thousand years.
[06:18.87]Ajax One approaching target.
[06:21.77]Range two kilometers.
[06:23.43]They see us.
[06:24.91]Three hostiles with RPGs.
[06:26.49]We can hit them from the other side of the world.
[06:28.53]And they'll run around 50-year-old Soviet weapons.
[06:30.38]Why do they even bother?
[06:32.85]Nice.
[06:33.05]North Pacific Islands.
[06:33.83]Does anybody actually care?
[06:34.97]I guess we kind of have to.
[07:04.81]It's very quiet.
[07:06.39]Well, a satellite just exploded.
[07:16.24]Shit!
[07:19.60]Come on, let me be... I want to be... Let me be the backup.
[07:27.61]Turn up the volume.
[07:28.95]I can't.
[07:29.61]I have to skip the cutscene to turn the volume up.
[07:35.12]Ah, it's the Aurora Borealis.
[07:37.90]It's beautiful this time of year.
[07:41.90]Alright.
[07:42.66]Can we play?
[07:43.06]Guantanamo Bay, Cuba.
[07:45.28]I'm going to have to break into it.
[07:53.69]Guantanamo Bay apparently is destroyed.
[07:59.87]What the fuck is going on here?
[08:03.50]I gotta use my Wii U gamepad for this.
[08:05.80]Open the door, twist!
[08:23.29]What the f- what is it?
[08:24.45]What is this?
[08:34.42]All right.
[08:36.98]And he breaks it in half.
[08:37.96]Good.
[08:38.35]Something bothering you, Ivan?
[08:40.59]The prison's been on emergency power.
[08:43.21]That's my plank.
[08:44.73]Oh, shit.
[08:45.51]It's Richard Nixon.
[08:46.29]Blame that on the trouble topside.
[08:47.77]That's what I need your help with.
[08:50.17]I don't do prison riots.
[08:51.65]I got to turn it up, but I can't skip this.
[08:53.49]But I think you like the reward.
[08:54.93]Do you know they call it Ivan the Terrible?
[09:01.07]How the hell did you get your hands on that?
[09:04.00]I like to keep you motivated, my friend.
[09:08.02]But I must warn you, most of the prison guards... Good joke.
[09:12.08]I need you to get past him to get to the surface to meet me.
[09:16.11]Do you copy?
[09:17.59]Every asshole in this place knows I'm working for you.
[09:20.37]Give me a few minutes.
[09:23.47]He was playing a song for the president.
[09:27.41]I will turn the audio up.
[09:28.45]Don't worry.
[09:28.75]Here we go.
[09:29.61]Turn it up.
[09:32.33]I just didn't know how loud it was going to be at the very beginning.
[09:34.29]Let's see if that's better.
[09:42.38]Is that any better?
[09:44.20]I can't even tell.
[09:49.48]I think that's better, right?
[09:53.58]Can I turn subtitles on?
[09:55.72]Save it.
[09:56.06]All right, let's go.
[10:02.57]Better?
[10:07.01]Camera controls.
[10:07.85]Yeah, you got it.
[10:08.99]Third person.
[10:13.42]Ow, my ears.
[10:15.72]It's not that loud.
[10:16.54]Fast melee attack.
[10:19.00]You got it.
[10:34.65]X is strong.
[10:39.16]Am I in prison?
[10:41.02]Oh, I'm in Guantanamo Bay.
[10:43.48]What the fuck is this game?
[10:44.52]These guys are easy.
[10:50.40]Where's the challenge?
[10:54.30]Is that guy still alive?
[10:55.94]Oh, no.
[10:56.23]He just wants me to go.
[11:03.99]Guard?
[11:04.59]L?
[11:07.51]L. No, alright.
[11:09.67]Wii U gamepad.
[11:11.59]This thing is covered with something because I can't even press the button.
[11:15.63]Does it have to play the same loop over and over again, by the way?
[11:19.87]That was kind of cool.
[11:24.75]That was kind of cool.
[11:31.94]Run through the doors.
[11:35.20]I just barely did that.
[11:40.66]Oh, no.
[11:43.60]No!
[11:45.10]That guy's got a gun.
[11:46.39]And that guy's got a sheathed katana.
[11:49.15]What is he holding?
[11:51.43]That is a huge pipe.
[11:52.49]I want it.
[11:53.83]I apparently have it now.
[11:54.91]It's mine now.
[11:56.27]Okay.
[12:00.30]Alright.
[12:00.56]Alright.
[12:02.70]I don't know where I got this, but apparently... Oh, no, we're at cutscene.
[12:09.39]Got one more job for you.
[12:11.59]Scan his eyes.
[12:12.51]Yep.
[12:14.25]I knew it.
[12:24.20]Hard game.
[12:24.84]Can I switch out?
[12:29.64]Yeah.
[12:30.06]Switch out the iron bar for the iron bar.
[12:32.95]That sounds like more fun, right?
[12:43.54]This is on Wii U?
[12:44.40]Yeah, this is on Wii U. Don't ask me why I decided to play this.
[12:49.11]Oh, he's talking about me!
[12:58.67]It's a giant metal bird?
[13:00.33]What?
[13:02.93]Thank you Diabeetles for the five bucks, by the way.
[13:06.27]And GrumpyGas, ten for the sub.
[13:09.03]CupcakesCanKill, RavioliMammaMia, TiresWerbs, RoyMZ, and Sido.
[13:15.71]Thank you guys.
[13:17.49]Thanks for the subscriptions.
[13:18.72]You guys fucking rock.
[13:21.24]Dodge?
[13:21.66]Dodge what?
[13:24.26]Oh, this is Dark Souls role, okay.
[13:30.08]That's very awkward, because holding down L is how you lock on to somebody.
[13:34.09]Where did you even... That doesn't make any sense.
[13:37.63]Alright, I... I hit that guy so hard with a pipe, his whole body exploded.
[13:44.96]How do I keep taking them?
[13:46.56]I don't... What the fuck is going on?
[13:50.60]This doesn't... Alright, they just made this game so much more brutal and horrible.
[13:59.65]Anything in here?
[14:00.51]No.
[14:00.75]There's nothing in these places.
[14:02.59]What am I talking about?
[14:03.45]Let's go.
[14:10.79]I bet I probably would have died if I didn't go.
[14:12.45]Alright.
[14:14.45]When do I get to the cars?
[14:16.07]There's got to be cars in this game, right?
[14:24.07]Is there a sneak kill?
[14:27.18]I think the game crashed.
[14:27.94]No, I'm good.
[14:29.62]What is happening to me?
[14:32.90]What is going on?
[14:33.59]Are there fucking birds coming out of here?
[14:35.21]Hey, watch out for the birds.
[14:38.25]Wait, what?
[14:44.35]I don't even... Wait, what?
[14:54.89]All right.
[14:58.01]Apparently the bats flying out of there killed me.
[15:02.01]Crouch down.
[15:02.53]That's what I'm doing.
[15:08.44]I almost died again.
[15:10.32]Because of the bats that fly through there.
[15:15.48]Real tough guy.
[15:18.26]Let's go!
[15:20.82]Climb wall.
[15:21.50]You got it.
[15:22.99]What the fuck?
[15:24.97]This is so annoying!
[15:26.29]I'm- Hold on, I hit my- I think I- Did I swing the thing around and hit myself in the face?
[15:37.95]The pole was in my face!
[15:39.66]I can't- AHH!
[15:46.74]What are you trying to tell me to do?
[15:48.34]Melee shot.
[15:57.12]Okay.
[15:59.04]Where the fuck did you come from?
[16:00.74]That guy was just up here.
[16:04.00]He's... Honest to God.
[16:06.64]Seriously.
[16:14.56]Watch out for the bats, crouch!
[16:19.74]Thank you, Colonel Zap, for the ten bucks.
[16:22.00]You missed my sub?
[16:22.86]Oh God, I'm so sorry.
[16:23.78]I'm just a bad streamer.
[16:29.52]There's no reason why I should have grabbed that ledge.
[16:31.58]That didn't make any sense.
[16:35.44]Oh shit!
[16:38.22]Oh shit, bats!
[16:39.93]I'm surrounded by bats!
[16:45.05]Ah, I made it.
[16:45.39]Watch out for the rat.
[16:53.51]That FOV is so bad when you're that close.
[16:57.67]Nowhere.
[17:03.53]Am I supposed to go this way?
[17:04.47]Can I grab on?
[17:08.14]Can I just shimmy on the wall?
[17:09.32]I'm just trying to figure out controls here, guys.
[17:15.54]Isn't that the hole I fell into coming this way?
[17:18.74]It is.
[17:19.56]What?
[17:23.75]Am I supposed to go this way?
[17:24.95]Did I come from here?
[17:25.61]I don't even know.
[17:26.11]I have no idea where I'm going or where I'm coming from.
[17:27.63]No, I'm supposed to go this way.
[17:31.33]Watch out, there's a prison fight.
[17:44.03]Auto-aim lock attack.
[17:53.78]There's no world with that.
[17:56.60]What?
[17:56.98]Can I throw it at this guy?
[18:00.40]Wow.
[18:01.14]I actually just did that.
[18:02.10]Okay.
[18:02.92]Hold on.
[18:07.64]Holy shit, you're a bad shot with that gun.
[18:11.52]Give me the gun.
[18:13.88]Nice.
[18:14.56]How do I shoot the gun?
[18:17.58]That's how you shoot the gun.
[18:18.24]Got it.
[18:19.59]How do you reload it?
[18:21.97]No, put it back on.
[18:23.09]I'm going up.
[18:28.85]Yeah, the guy just got insta-gibbed.
[18:30.25]That was insane.
[18:36.32]I hate how it just goes immediately aimed on sights.
[18:46.78]You didn't get me!
[18:48.50]Sorry guy, you didn't get me even though you tried.
[18:50.44]I'm dead.
[18:54.92]You tried your best and that's all that matters, right?
[19:00.73]Why do they explode?
[19:07.00]Nice aim, dude.
[19:07.92]Yeah, I think I was just shooting the air.
[19:09.34]Alright, I think I am going to turn the music down because it's kind of blowing up my head right now.
[19:25.91]Come on, shoot me!
[19:27.31]Shoot me!
[19:29.54]I know you can do it.
[19:30.56]I've got so much faith that you can do it.
[19:34.26]Oh, you got me.
[19:35.16]Come on.
[19:39.73]Dumbass.
[19:40.13]Alright, where's the boss?
[19:44.99]How do I... Alright, there we go.
[19:46.29]That's how you do it.
[19:49.29]He was trying to shoot the bats.
[19:52.47]No, don't jump.
[19:53.65]What the hell?
[19:55.45]These controls, like, I don't even... I can't even tell you how to pull the gun up.
[19:58.63]Is it Y?
[19:59.45]X?
[20:00.57]A?
[20:02.29]A. Up.
[20:04.01]It's up on the D-pad.
[20:04.85]You got it.
[20:12.30]I don't understand why they just explode.
[20:13.94]These people are mannequins.
[20:16.69]When you shoot one bullet at them, they turn into... Like if you threw a mannequin down the fucking stairs.
[20:22.55]All their body parts come off.
[20:24.37]That guy wasn't even aiming at me.
[20:25.61]He was aiming at his friend that used to be over here.
[20:28.51]Okay.
[20:35.53]Anything new?
[20:36.07]Ooh, machete.
[20:39.47]Cool.
[20:42.28]Did I just pick up money?
[20:42.90]What was that?
[20:43.28]Ammo?
[20:46.99]Whatever.
[20:55.37]Come here!
[20:56.56]Come here!
[21:03.18]What do I have?
[21:03.50]What do I have?
[21:03.82]What is that?
[21:04.38]What?
[21:13.47]This is just... This just doesn't make any sense.
[21:19.13]That guy's head... What is going on?
[21:31.00]Hold on, I'm gonna throw it at this guy.
[21:39.94]Oh, he dodged it.
[21:42.12]No, I apparently still have molotovs.
[21:46.72]Pick them up.
[21:51.60]What the fuck?
[21:52.66]Why are those not working?
[21:59.12]Okay, I kind of like this game.
[22:04.45]It's like, it's too... It's too out of control to hate it.
[22:12.85]You know what I mean?
[22:13.73]It's too over the top.
[22:18.81]Shotgun?
[22:20.39]I don't even know.
[22:23.01]I guess.
[22:23.37]I wish you didn't have to.
[22:23.93]I guess you don't have to.
[22:24.71]Alright, interact.
[22:27.78]Let's go.
[22:31.08]Cool.
[22:32.32]I love this game already.
[22:34.14]Defeat your enemies in melee combat and receive the flames of their souls.
[22:37.94]Gather these flames, bind them to you, strengthen your own with enough.
[22:41.10]Your senses shall truly awaken.
[22:45.02]So we're not just like a standard third person shooter.
[22:47.36]We're collecting souls.
[22:50.36]And I have like a spider sense.
[22:53.20]Enable... Enable what?
[22:55.26]Y and B. Y and B. Huh?
[23:01.58]I don't get it.
[23:02.02]I'm trying to do Y and B. Y and B is just jump.
[23:08.76]That's not what I was doing.
[23:10.14]Was it Y and B?
[23:14.95]I want to Y and B somebody.
[23:15.99]Oh, my God.
[23:24.47]Just get out of my way, please.
[23:26.23]For one second.
[23:26.83]Hold on.
[23:27.95]Hold on.
[23:34.05]I need to... This music, I don't like it.
[23:48.32]Put these back up.
[23:49.10]Put this town.
[23:53.53]Alright.
[23:54.19]Save it.
[23:59.57]I don't think... That didn't change a damn thing.
[24:03.77]Alright, YMB.
[24:07.71]Um... Alright, I just like turned... My body started smoking.
[24:14.26]And that guy's head came off.
[24:15.60]Okay.
[24:15.70]Okay.
[24:20.24]Dash.
[24:21.96]Dash and slide.
[24:22.72]Alright, that was kind of cool.
[24:27.82]Slide through the doors.
[24:40.76]This level design... Oh my god.
[24:47.46]I don't feel like I'm in that much danger, but I probably am.
[24:54.06]I'm in danger.
[24:55.24]I gotta use the shuriken, whatever it's called.
[24:57.14]What was it called?
[25:08.61]Oh my god, you're so hard to aim.
[25:13.95]Get him!
[25:15.53]Oh my god, please!
[25:17.07]Please just hit that guy.
[25:19.45]What the fuck is going on with these?
[25:24.34]They're empty, so it don't even matter anymore.
[25:26.08]Who cares?
[25:26.46]Who cares?
[25:37.51]I gotta slide and get this guy.
[25:38.63]Watch this.
[25:40.39]Nice.
[25:44.15]Can I get out of this stupid prison yet?
[25:45.53]No.
[25:45.85]Look, I gotta do it here.
[25:49.83]First boss.
[25:53.32]So they're gonna fight the crane boss?
[26:09.33]Eliminate the head inmate.
[26:12.19]Uh-oh.
[26:12.47]Is the head inmate's name Molotov?
[26:16.33]Or is that giving me a hint on how I should get rid of him?
[26:21.58]Did they just kind of run out of names?
[26:22.87]I think so.
[26:29.15]Oh, his name's Molotov because he throws molotovs.
[26:47.46]Oh, you shot me with a clip!
[26:51.93]No, I'm coming to get you on the second level.
[26:55.39]I ain't coming down.
[26:56.09]I'm actually just going to throw shit at the wall that you're protected by.
[26:58.53]You guys are all so bad.
[27:16.38]I'll get him.
[27:19.79]Is he dead?
[27:20.23]No, he's going this way.
[27:23.66]No, he's coming over here.
[27:24.88]Uh-oh, he's getting closer.
[27:28.40]Where'd he go?
[27:30.32]Oh, he's up there now.
[27:49.44]Still alive, he's still alive.
[27:50.38]Hold on, I'm gonna have to do a melee finish.
[27:53.00]Still alive, asshole.
[27:55.20]Big mistake.
[27:56.46]I agree.
[27:58.24]Oh!
[27:58.96]What the?
[27:59.64]Wow!
[28:00.48]One hit!
[28:01.42]I got him in one hit.
[28:02.32]That was one bullet.
[28:08.30]That's all it took.
[28:09.54]I shot him like 300 times.
[28:13.54]This game is fucking great.
[28:15.62]What a great game.
[28:28.74]Yeah, first try.
[28:29.64]First try, first shot.
[28:32.78]Nice ride.
[28:34.02]I found a vehicle that wasn't affected by the EMP in a museum back in the States.
[28:40.04]This one's a pre-electronic relic like me.
[28:43.64]That's what you want me to deal with?
[28:45.32]Wait, what?
[28:47.82]That's one way of looking at it.
[28:50.50]Look at this guy's butt chin.
[28:51.32]I thought that was a gun.
[28:53.73]I thought he was going to shoot me.
[28:57.29]God, I wish I had like a big butt chin, you know what I mean?
[29:00.25]Quiet.
[29:23.98]Yeah, he's got a butt chin.
[29:24.68]He's got like one of those big manly chins.
[29:29.76]No, no face cam right now.
[29:37.00]I'll take this opportunity to say thank you to Oat Whales for four months.
[29:41.06]Evo Sigma for 11 months.
[29:42.26]Game sucks.
[29:42.90]Streamer sucks.
[29:44.70]Thanks for 11 months, Evo.
[29:47.56]Thank you, Captain Schneider, for 10 months.
[29:50.09]They say, Papa.
[29:52.15]Well, thank you, Schneider.
[29:53.86]Approximately one-third of the military satellites in orbit are decommissioned Soviet hardware.
[29:59.78]A good number were nuclear-powered.
[30:02.26]Somehow, self-destruct codes for several of these satellites were obtained, and on November 1st, the codes were deployed.
[30:19.55]All right, I'm not... Oh, and by the way, all you guys that want to talk shit about how small I am and how like, oh, German is so tiny.
[30:34.37]I actually I got some pictures that I want to show.
[30:36.91]I'm going to do a little slideshow right now because I mean, I just popped into my head.
[30:40.31]I didn't like everything.
[30:41.15]I didn't really want to prepare for this.
[30:44.37]Yeah.
[30:44.71]So I had I got in contact with with my mother and I said, Mom, can you send me some photos?
[30:48.84]Because I don't really have very many photos on my computer.
[30:51.70]And she sent me quite a few of them.
[30:52.92]So I just want to make sure we prove that not only am I of a certain height, I'm not fucking like five feet tall.
[31:01.74]So let's go through some of the photos here.
[31:02.96]That's me in a trench coat.
[31:07.25]I was a bad guy for Halloween like a couple years ago.
[31:11.31]Clearly not five feet tall in that one, as you can see.
[31:13.83]And then this is one of my friends.
[31:15.97]We were having a little bit of a little punch, you know, a little romp there.
[31:19.59]He's my little friend.
[31:20.54]His name's David.
[31:28.06]These are from my mother, by the way, so you can't say that they're not real.
[31:31.80]This was taken just over like 150 years ago, I think.
[31:37.96]This is the first unveiling of the Model T. I was present for it.
[31:44.25]As you can see, these two women friends here.
[31:47.55]Very small women here.
[31:48.79]Actually, those are very tall women.
[31:51.03]And of course, I helped a guy open up his shop 40 years ago or so.
[31:59.26]I think this is an old grocery store, actually, that I was a part of.
[32:04.12]So it was good to help him out.
[32:05.43]He's 6'2", by the way.
[32:06.95]Just in case you were fucking wondering.
[32:10.43]This is when I met The Rock.
[32:12.39]And you know, The Rock is a wrestler, so he's fucking huge.
[32:15.89]Me and The Rock kind of go way back.
[32:18.47]Although, you know, I'm a lot bigger than him, so, you know, that stuff happens that way.
[32:21.87]This is me and my ex-girlfriend.
[32:23.77]We're just kind of strolling around down New York City.
[32:27.24]It's, um... Not a big deal.
[32:29.92]I mean, we saw each other for a few years, I think.
[32:34.45]And this one is... That one shouldn't be there.
[32:39.33]That one... Okay.
[32:41.87]Fucked it up.
[32:42.47]All right.
[32:44.79]Who fucking put those in?
[32:47.19]Which one of you hacked my computer and put those in?
[32:49.56]Huh?
[32:50.08]Yeah, real fucking funny.
[32:54.28]One of you hackers got a hold of my fucking data files, huh?
[32:58.56]Okay.
[32:59.46]Funny.
[33:01.04]Just want to fucking prove to you guys.
[33:05.64]Bunch of fucking dicks.
[33:07.75]Oh, look, that's me.
[33:08.69]That's me coming with a big doorway, ducking my head down because I'm so fucking tall.
[33:17.89]The electromagnetic pulse also destroyed most of the electronic devices on the planet.
[33:23.20]Aircraft off from the sky, passenger chains collided.
[33:26.98]Global defense and communication networks, emergency response, power grids, financial markets, all down.
[33:33.60]Several governments have already fallen, and America has declared martial law.
[33:38.61]This attack was launched by veterans of the Soviet special ops unit known as the School of Democracy.
[33:46.81]sworn enemies of the Russian state.
[33:48.37]November 4th, the SOD wiped out Panama Canal.
[33:52.23]They are now in combat with our 7th group who were deployed as reinforcements.
[33:57.17]Who fucking cares about any of this?
[33:59.79]...paralyzed worldwide maritime traffic by destroying the new Panama Canal.
[34:04.61]I don't care about this at all.
[34:05.91]...the SOD has apparently added biological weapons to its arsenal.
[34:10.25]And Ivan, you must use any and all mental abilities to neutralize the SOD.
[34:17.05]What do I do?
[34:17.47]Do I gotta... Do I gotta sod something?
[34:19.23]Do I gotta put down fake grass?
[34:42.24]Who cares about this shit?
[34:44.70]Go ahead and get checked out on the gear.
[34:50.64]This is, like, more interesting to me than this fucking game right now.
[34:58.08]I love how these can be, like, the same picture.
[35:02.11]This guy's in the same clothes.
[35:03.17]Is this the same guy?
[35:05.69]What?
[35:06.17]Hold on.
[35:07.37]Is this the same person?
[35:13.27]Wait, wait, what do I do?
[35:14.59]Oh.
[35:19.73]cover the screen with them.
[35:23.36]Oh my fucking god, I don't care about any of this.
[35:25.14]Thank you to Sam for the five bucks.
[35:26.94]And Magpie for 1,100 bits.
[35:27.84]What would you realistically do if the new Star Wars ended with a gorilla reading a book?
[35:45.01]I would sue Disney for $200 million in damages.
[35:50.18]But thank you for the bits, dude.
[35:51.10]I haven't looked at the screen to see what's happening in this game in about 10 straight minutes.
[35:54.56]And I can't skip it.
[36:14.37]Gentlemen, we've just entered Panamanian airspace.
[36:17.59]OK.
[36:18.23]Gear up.
[36:27.97]Sam.
[36:29.09]What?
[36:29.69]It's a Cluck K. Releasing countermeasures.
[36:33.15]We'll have to abort if this keeps up.
[36:34.95]If you can steady out the aircraft, we can make it down in our extra suits.
[36:38.35]They'll blow you out of the sky.
[36:44.42]Okay, can we please play the fucking game?
[36:48.22]For the love of God.
[36:49.22]What, I jumped out of the plane?
[36:52.71]I'm gonna rescue everybody or something, right?
[36:55.81]I'm the one that's gonna rescue everybody.
[36:57.73]Good.
[37:01.73]It's just like H1Z1.
[37:18.92]Please tell me I can drive cars in this game.
[37:20.34]That would make this game a solid 10 out of 10.
[37:29.83]What is it like?
[37:30.43]What is that?
[37:36.83]So what is this?
[37:37.41]Like the government conspiracy or something?
[37:39.35]These are like the bug government people with the big sunglasses on.
[37:41.73]I think I'm playing now.
[37:46.98]No, I...
[37:53.67]I hope somebody in the chat is just catching any of this story, because I have no idea what's going on.
[37:59.78]Big Mouse is the boss's name.
[38:01.30]Okay.
[38:01.62]Big Mouse.
[38:02.52]Make sure to take the anti-poison gas.
[38:15.49]Okay.
[38:16.07]I don't even have a joke there.
[38:17.29]Yeah.
[38:30.15]Okay, this thing's good, I guess.
[38:32.09]Now this is not running at 60 frames anymore.
[38:47.03]The car blew up behind me.
[38:54.44]That shit is so misleading as to where that's actually going.
[39:01.60]You didn't try to move.
[39:02.52]God, I almost wish I could use the stylus to aim him.
[39:19.26]I'm hitting the guardrail, by the way.
[39:32.29]Wait can I blow up the school bus oh?
[39:38.33]Come on Come on it definitely can blow no apparently not He's still he was staring at that grenade He looked if that grenade had eyes he was looking at the grenades eyes I
[40:01.38]Without Stella, it might take me a minute to get through.
[40:04.58]There's like a thousand people.
[40:11.50]Okay, they just like did not even tactically put those enemies there anymore.
[40:20.05]I don't remember this game at the Nintendo World Championships.
[40:23.45]Oh, great.
[40:24.19]Okay, no, no, no.
[40:24.73]This is fine.
[40:29.43]Somebody has...
[40:30.87]Guys, I want you to see this.
[40:31.63]This guy's shooting a rocket launcher through the windshield of this car.
[40:38.86]You can't shoot through the windshield and hit me with a... Oh, God.
[40:45.37]I don't even know what to say.
[40:49.35]I really don't.
[40:53.71]Can we please throw this?
[41:00.13]I think he shot himself.
[41:01.66]I think the guy at the rocket launcher shot his own people.
[41:05.16]He shot the ground.
[41:06.26]I didn't do that.
[41:07.56]I had nothing to do with that.
[41:09.48]Absolutely zero.
[41:20.23]Shit, wrong button.
[41:24.00]Oh, watch out!
[41:30.94]Oh, RPG.
[41:32.70]Thank you very much.
[41:33.44]I'll take it.
[41:35.46]No, that other guy has an RPG.
[41:40.55]I wonder if I even need to fight this guy.
[41:41.83]I wonder if he'll shoot his own people again.
[41:44.75]No, that's not going to happen.
[41:55.08]Why would I still be alive after this?
[42:00.05]Something happened down there.
[42:00.97]Hold on.
[42:13.42]What is this one?
[42:14.90]Oh, cool!
[42:25.10]I'm sorry.
[42:25.78]I just needed to see what was... I just needed to see...
[42:32.53]You tried to shoot through the car window too?
[42:34.15]Nice finger painting.
[42:39.13]It's alright.
[42:39.73]Another guy down there.
[42:49.83]I'll get these guys up there.
[42:52.15]Nice.
[42:52.45]That guy's still alive?
[42:54.25]What?
[42:54.45]This is so dumb.
[43:03.66]They're all just standing, shooting randomly.
[43:06.22]In random directions.
[43:09.96]You're fine.
[43:11.37]That guy's fine.
[43:18.57]How do I... I just clocked that guy in the skull with that one.
[43:29.34]That was great.
[43:31.84]Right in his head.
[43:40.60]I'm trying.
[43:46.71]Oh boy.
[43:47.05]This ain't good at all.
[43:56.87]Could you guys be a little more tactical about this?
[43:59.03]Is someone behind me now?
[44:00.83]Where the fuck did you come from?
[44:11.12]Is that guy on my team?
[44:15.46]I'm so confused right now.
[44:18.18]Is this a bad guy?
[44:19.86]No, that guy's on my fucking team.
[44:23.69]Okay, I get it.
[44:24.77]Makes sense.
[44:25.25]Somebody shut that thing up!
[44:49.37]Well, let's go.
[44:50.13]What the fuck are you guys doing?
[44:51.75]Might as well fill it up again.
[44:57.78]Go, go, go.
[45:03.44]Roger Bravo wins?
[45:19.10]Can I take out the chopper?
[45:26.40]Don't even need to.
[45:27.18]Somebody did it already.
[45:27.92]I was hoping he was going to explode.
[45:48.72]Probably shouldn't be using this in an enclosed area like this, but you know, who cares?
[45:55.44]Link up with him at the plaza.
[46:07.64]Sure.
[46:07.98]Whatever that means.
[46:09.46]Open the door.
[46:10.02]Can you open this door, man?
[46:10.96]What are you doing?
[46:22.32]No, I don't know what he's doing.
[46:23.40]He's just looking at it.
[46:24.00]Okay, now he's going to blow the door.
[46:27.29]Let's go!
[46:51.87]You can't climb over this.
[46:53.00]Get over that, dude.
[46:55.60]Oh my lord.
[46:57.12]He can't climb over it.
[46:58.50]He's apparently too... It's too high to climb over.
[47:02.66]Here come the tanks.
[47:03.94]Lock on.
[47:22.51]Okay.
[47:25.59]ZL.
[47:27.63]Uh, that's... that's not locking on.
[47:36.79]Oh, that is.
[47:37.37]This is so stupid.
[47:46.67]I'm just gonna walk over there.
[47:48.47]Who cares, right?
[47:58.46]That whizzed right by me.
[48:02.89]The game is playing itself.
[48:04.01]It really is.
[48:04.79]It just is just... What?
[48:05.99]No.
[48:06.39]It's the boss.
[48:06.81]I'll tell you.
[48:25.54]I hate when games...
[48:31.28]Alright, whatever you say, Super Mario.
[48:37.57]Apparently, I'm Super Mario as well.
[48:41.31]Alright, that seems to work.
[48:48.17]I was going to say, I hate when games do a cutscene to have a character walk like five feet.
[49:00.39]Hey, here's a cutscene.
[49:01.33]No, no, the guy just jumped up a wall.
[49:03.15]That was the whole cutscene.
[49:04.45]You wanna play again?
[49:06.69]Have fun!
[49:22.74]Why would they give this gun to me?
[49:26.38]Doesn't seem fair to have this right now.
[49:29.84]And who's still alive after that?
[49:34.50]Can I wall run?
[49:35.18]I don't think so.
[49:43.37]I was waiting for you.
[49:52.77]I guess we can open this thing.
[49:55.07]I just want another boss.
[50:02.40]That was not smart for that guy just to stand right in front of me while I shoot him.
[50:07.14]There's a sniper rifle now.
[50:09.08]Nice.
[50:10.22]This should be fun.
[50:15.83]They wouldn't be giving me a sniper rifle if I didn't need to use it, right?
[50:28.03]Is this a newspaper?
[50:29.90]Oh.
[50:31.00]A trophy.
[50:31.43]I collected a trophy.
[50:32.29]Nice.
[50:33.41]Who cares?
[50:33.99]I'm not going to keep track of that.
[50:37.79]Snipe.
[50:38.39]Sniper.
[50:48.57]This is... This is... This is not... This is not... This is not good.
[50:59.50]At least I don't have to go near them.
[51:08.29]Reload it.
[51:16.17]The thing is, I feel like there's a game here.
[51:18.69]Anyone else feel like that?
[51:20.09]Anybody?
[51:22.27]That is shooting an RPG right next to us.

[52:02.69]I mean, there are a couple of things we could... Ceiling just caved in on me.
[52:17.40]Okay.
[52:20.32]I love how everyone's writing, next.
[52:23.26]Next.
[52:26.10]There he is!
[52:26.50]I see him!
[52:27.04]Ooh!
[52:28.06]Ow!
[52:30.24]Alright, no, don't get caved in on.
[52:32.98]The ceiling caves in, guys.
[52:34.26]Watch out!
[52:35.30]There's only one guy with me.
[52:49.78]No, we're not done.
[52:50.42]Not next yet.
[52:51.79]We're not done yet.
[52:55.39]We're staying on this for like at least another 20 minutes.
[53:04.40]We're not done yet.
[53:05.10]Alright, their AI hasn't loaded yet.
[53:19.49]God damn it!
[53:26.18]My desk bumped R1.
[53:34.18]This huge brick-ass iPad just pressed against my desk.
[53:38.36]That is what happened.
[53:45.52]Guy with an RPG, there's always like three of them.
[53:49.62]Who else?
[53:50.49]Yeah, you're dead.
[53:53.87]God.
[53:56.73]Sword them.
[53:57.17]I can't even get close to them.
[53:58.33]I'll die instantly if I run up there.
[53:59.85]Alright, I'll use the sword for a little while.
[54:06.19]If I can even take the damn thing out.
[54:09.61]That's how you take out different guns.
[54:12.63]Okay, I don't know how to take it out.
[54:13.73]Sorry.
[54:19.01]Here comes a cutscene.
[54:20.59]I wonder if we're going to stop running right here and it's going to cut back to the game in like 10 seconds.
[54:41.17]Very fitting considering that there's been only explosions so far in this game.
[54:44.55]Did I just put a cigarette in my mouth?
[54:50.99]I still can't move.
[54:53.01]Now why is this not part of the cutscene?
[55:02.14]You'd think that they would show some cinematic angles here.
[55:17.04]Get up.
[55:17.92]I don't want to sit here anymore.
[55:21.06]They didn't even need to cut away from that.
[55:26.26]Why did they give me control of the game?
[55:28.32]They could have just... Ah, shit.
[55:34.14]Somebody shot my glass.
[55:37.51]It's the next boss.
[55:38.49]Sniper Wolf.
[55:39.59]It really is Sniper Wolf.
[55:41.39]Impossible.
[55:52.08]Am I supposed to know who that- Am I supposed to care?
[55:53.96]Alright, beat it.
[55:57.94]We beat it, guys.
[55:58.66]That was fucking easy.
[56:00.01]Got her.
[56:02.21]Hey, remember this?
[56:02.69]Remember this guy with the long hair shot his gun at the guy's head?
[56:05.75]Let's try to take you back.
[56:07.91]We're gonna give you a- We're gonna trickle in the data.
[56:40.44]They're gonna keep giving you story pieces out of context for the next, like, four hours.
[56:49.74]The mission here was to sweep for insurgents.
[56:53.29]This town has been infested like rats.
[56:56.21]You had to fumigate, then burn them in their nest.
[56:59.77]Those kids in the hospital, were they terrorists?
[57:04.93]Kill them while they're young, cabrón.
[57:10.14]Viewer games?
[57:11.10]Of what?
[57:12.34]Of this?
[57:14.21]Let's play some viewer games.
[57:15.73]Viewer games.
[57:16.97]Uh-oh, watch out.
[57:17.81]He's gonna shoot me.
[57:18.35]No, I ran away and they didn't get me.
[57:42.93]Guys, I made this in the movies.
[57:49.44]I'm getting a real movies vibe from this.
[57:54.74]Did I make this cutscene?
[57:56.54]I may have.
[57:57.20]I don't remember.
[58:14.63]So she's dead?
[58:15.63]I don't know.
[58:16.63]Oh, no, she's dead.
[58:17.23]But didn't I just shoot her with a gun?
[58:18.50]This is where the soldiers come in.
[58:31.07]Yep.
[58:32.87]All we need is a guy in a gorilla costume.
[58:46.40]Yeah, I just had that big flashback.
[58:47.96]I'll bring another cigarette.
[58:58.57]Yeah, if you're a badass in a video game, you better smoke a cigarette, you know?
[59:02.79]Yeah, I just ran into one of my former students.
[59:06.76]Her code name is C4.
[59:08.64]I put the tracking bullet into her.
[59:11.34]This is all too familiar.
[59:12.58]Tracking bullet into her.
[59:14.26]Okay.
[59:14.45]I'm sure the same specialist is behind it.
[59:18.43]He calls himself Big Mouse.
[59:21.13]Awful fucking names.
[59:22.31]Big Mouse.
[59:24.09]C4.
[59:24.81]Big Mouse.
[59:27.86]Trash can.
[59:31.60]Small dog.
[59:36.64]Light post.
[59:37.68]We're just going to say consonants or what?
[59:39.10]Alright, we get to play again.
[59:46.52]This is going to be not fun.
[59:50.67]I can already guarantee that to you guys.
[59:54.59]That is a 100% guarantee.
[59:57.19]This is not going to be fun.
[59:59.17]They always have a rocket launcher.
[60:00.45]Everybody has one.
[60:02.33]And he'll shoot it.
[60:02.95]Yeah, he'll shoot it no matter fucking what.
[60:11.07]He was gonna shoot it.
[60:13.34]That fucking idiot was just gonna shoot a rocket launcher at me.
[60:18.04]How did you get behind me?
[60:26.83]I don't understand it, but it's okay.
[60:49.78]So badly.
[60:50.68]Oh, there go all my bullets.
[60:52.50]Oh, well.
[60:57.56]Not fair.
[61:00.46]Nice.
[61:01.68]That was a pretty cool move.
[61:02.52]Nice fucking backflip he just did into the katana.
[61:11.49]Wait, I think I got my move right.
[61:13.37]Nope, I don't.
[61:18.68]They keep doing the same little QTE move.
[61:25.58]I bet that was real cool the first time that somebody did that.
[61:28.32]You know, like I just did it five times in a row.
[61:31.11]Was kinda cool the first time I did it.
[61:42.59]Hey, what do you guys know?
[61:43.55]A guy with a rocket launcher that's gonna shoot it every four seconds.
[61:46.59]And he's not even shooting me anymore.
[61:49.21]Go on.
[61:50.65]Alright, he got me right in the head.
[61:57.10]I'm just trying to make a point.
[61:59.28]And you guys already know it.
[62:00.34]I don't even know why I need to do it.
[62:04.94]QTE.
[62:09.34]Oh, shitty game Saturday.
[62:10.44]Not even Saturday.
[62:11.54]It's Thursday.
[62:34.18]That doesn't do a damn thing.
[62:35.10]It's not even worth putting my head out there.
[62:36.34]Just use the... This is the rocket launcher game.
[62:38.42]You only use rocket launchers.
[62:41.13]If they're gonna do that, why not I do it too?
[62:46.39]That's a safe play, right?
[62:51.84]Use the rocket launcher like a pistol.
[62:53.78]Just hit them directly with it.
[63:15.55]Next game, next game, next game.
[63:17.49]What?
[63:18.01]You guys don't want to see anymore of Devil's Third?
[63:19.92]Wait, what?
[63:26.52]I missed, hold on.
[63:27.98]I missed that.
[63:29.12]I just missed that.
[63:29.96]I slid by him.
[63:32.14]And he slashed my friend.
[63:40.37]Come on, you guys don't want to see any more of this?
[63:43.60]After that right there?
[63:45.30]You don't want... What the hell was that?
[63:50.10]Game, you could have just redeemed yourself if I could use the maracas as a melee weapon.
[63:59.67]Well, you know what game I'm playing.
[64:02.85]Might as well keep sticking to the plan.
[64:15.75]I can't think of a more boring thing to have in the game than a mandatory rocket launcher for every fight.
[64:23.72]Can you?
[64:24.04]I don't think those guys are even dead.
[64:36.03]I hope those guys are dead because I'm gonna die if I go over there.
[64:43.77]The movies.
[64:47.39]We have to get to the next boss first.
[64:59.11]I think I got him.
[65:00.97]Now what?
[65:03.52]Skate 3.
[65:04.42]No, we're on a Nintendo Wii U right now.
[65:06.54]It's all hooked up.
[65:07.32]I can't... If I unhook it, I have to restart the stream and... Okay, this is different.
[65:11.78]Here's the boss.
[65:12.14]You guys didn't think... Here we go.
[65:13.28]Got interesting right now.
[65:16.00]Wait, what?
[65:20.31]I feel like we're halfway through the game.
[65:25.61]Randy Savage.
[65:26.21]He's just a macho man.
[65:52.75]What?
[65:53.91]Hold on, I gotta fight the whole brigade.
[65:55.71]Wait, you guys thought this game wasn't even good.
[65:57.97]There's an axe?
[65:59.41]There's a fucking fire axe.
[66:02.45]That's how you can tell that the game is a good game.
[66:04.25]What game is that?
[66:20.32]I don't even... Where are they going?
[66:21.82]What is...
[66:28.68]What the fuck are you supposed to do?
[66:30.30]Hold on a second.
[66:45.20]Hold on.
[66:51.24]No, don't run into them.
[66:52.52]Just stay behind the pillar.
[66:55.88]This is so dumb.
[66:57.97]This is so stupid.
[66:59.43]Okay, I'm gonna just hide.
[67:08.32]I wanted to try to just smash into everybody and slide.
[67:11.15]Not gonna be able to do that.
[67:13.45]This really is just EDF with people.
[67:29.44]How unnecessary are all these people?
[67:31.14]Really?
[67:32.77]They're all so unnecessary.
[67:33.85]They don't have... Why would they... Alright, they can take the pillar out, apparently.
[67:43.65]Well, now I have grenades.
[67:44.89]Now there's still a shitload of people alive.
[68:03.11]Give me this thing.
[68:13.95]Reload it.
[68:17.93]This takes a long time to reload.
[68:40.18]I just electrocuted that guy and he died.
[68:42.40]This is on the regular difficulty.
[68:52.37]This is on the regular difficulty, I swear to god.
[69:07.58]Holy shit, this is insanely bad.
[69:17.64]God, that's the T-Virus.
[69:20.76]This is not good.
[69:28.19]That actually is the T-Virus, isn't it?
[69:29.75]Don't even fucking tell me.
[69:32.79]No way this guy's gonna turn into a giant demon.
[69:35.31]I don't believe it.
[69:39.22]Alright, he just turned into a slightly bigger version of himself.
[69:49.64]Okay, it wasn't that easy.
[69:51.58]Okay.
[70:08.99]If I just LMG'd him to death.
[70:15.75]Come on, come and get me!
[70:23.96]Ah!
[70:24.96]It's Father Gascoigne!
[70:40.59]Eat shit, Gascoigne.
[70:41.71]You're fucking dead.
[70:42.59]I can't even get up.
[70:55.76]Oh, god damn it.
[70:56.66]I don't want to do this again.
[71:11.41]Oh my god, this is so stupid.
[71:22.84]Yeah, I have an RPG and look, it does like 2% damage.
[71:32.91]And I can't even shoot it because he's like right up my ass the whole time.
[71:44.14]Alright, just take out the katana and just... Wow.
[71:47.74]Why did I... That was so easy by just doing a melee attack.
[71:55.20]You gotta be kidding me.
[71:58.85]Shoot a guy with a fucking rocket launcher six times.
[72:03.11]Or slash him five times with the melee weapon.
[72:05.61]I hope he gets up again.
[72:11.44]I would laugh my ass off.
[72:25.84]Okay.
[72:27.78]Well.
[72:30.12]Thank you, Cryptic Ascent, for the 500 bits.
[72:32.72]I think we need Ivan in the next German Rumble.
[72:35.95]Possibly.
[72:37.10]Renegade Coaster, a little while back, gave $30, 3,000 bits.
[72:41.74]Jeremy, let me reimburse you for this wonderful game.
[72:45.30]You didn't have to do that, dude.

[74:57.71]Just wanna make sure.

[75:01.63]I woke up early to catch your stream and you actually started on time.
[75:04.00]I'm impressed.
[75:04.56]Well, sometimes we start on time.
[75:08.59]And no soup for you, one of our mods for 10 months.
[75:13.42]Thank you for sticking around for that long, dude.
[75:20.34]Alrighty, let's do it.
[75:23.66]I wish I could skip this cutscene, I really do.
[75:25.74]Smash Brothers is next?
[75:26.66]I don't know what's gonna be next.
[75:27.66]Alright, if the next level is so awful... Alright, we already got a good... This is gonna be a good level, are you kidding me?
[75:41.04]Look at how much fun this one is.
[75:43.80]Are these guys bad guys?
[75:52.25]No, that's a good guy.
[75:52.89]Okay, you can't kill good guys.
[76:02.48]What?
[76:16.12]Okay, that's enough of that.
[76:17.51]Who's left?
[76:20.27]Who's... These guys?
[76:21.31]I don't know.
[76:21.71]Okay, apparently it's those guys.
[76:23.47]This is the worst level yet.
[76:28.01]Yeah, it is.
[76:29.55]I'll give you that.
[76:30.13]It is the worst level yet.
[76:32.32]But there's potential that it might turn into the best level yet.
[76:34.24]Because when we fight the boss that's coming up here in like 10 seconds.
[76:49.63]Oh, watch out.
[76:50.43]I can't turn that far.
[76:51.91]Someone's going to have to get him.
[76:55.91]This is so all over the place.
[76:57.27]I really don't even know what I need to be shooting here.
[76:59.51]This guy's just driving in circles.
[77:00.97]Alright, good job.
[77:04.79]Did I win?
[77:06.37]We win.
[77:10.42]Apparently we win.
[77:19.69]I need to do things my own way, Captain.
[77:21.55]But I appreciate that your men have their own mission.
[77:25.17]Next.
[77:25.91]Next.
[77:28.31]No, we have to... Escape.
[77:30.41]Oh, shit!
[77:38.98]Well... That's a... That's a... Hold on.
[77:43.82]It's okay.
[77:44.38]We're fine.
[77:50.27]The whole drink just dumped backwards.
[77:51.82]I don't know.
[77:52.20]Why did that even happen?
[77:55.40]Hold on.
[77:56.92]My controls still work?
[77:59.04]Alright, I'm good.
[78:01.36]I was gonna say, I spent 30 bucks on this game.
[78:05.00]I wanna at least give it like 10 more seconds.
[78:06.86]10.
[78:06.88]9.
[78:07.32]8.
[78:07.42]7.
[78:07.46]6.
[78:07.54]5.
[78:07.56]4.
[78:07.58]3. 2.
[78:20.68]Two.
[78:27.33]One.
[78:27.47]Two.
[78:37.19]Two!
[78:56.72]Ten.
[78:58.47]Nine.
[78:59.77]Eight.
[79:01.87]Seven.
[79:04.77]Six.
[79:13.44]Five.
[79:14.96]Four.
[79:17.06]Three.
[79:20.55]Two.
[79:27.81]one!
[79:29.18]Alright, we're fucking out.
[79:29.98]Goodbye.
[79:31.86]Fine, we'll move on.
[79:33.16]Fine.
[79:37.12]If you guys don't want to see it that fast... What else am I gonna play?
[79:41.92]Like, fucking Mario Maker?
[79:43.18]Alright.
[79:48.65]Well... I hate playing Mario Maker with this piece of shit controller.
[79:56.27]Please wait.
[80:07.77]Hold on, the website didn't... Alright, here's your choices, guys.
[80:11.79]You ready?
[80:15.05]We got... WarioWare Smooth Moves.
[80:17.83]Mario Maker.
[80:20.45]Or that's... Yeah, that's... Those are your... Or... The shitty Wii games.
[80:23.97]Because I think I have some that I've never played before.
[80:26.85]Let's make a poll.
[80:27.51]Why not?
[80:27.89]That sounds like a plan.
[80:33.10]Struffle.
[80:34.82]We're playing WarioWare...
[80:37.99]Mario Maker or shitty WiiWare games that I have that I don't think I ever played.
[80:43.19]Maybe I did.
[80:43.77]Who knows?
[80:44.01]Let me just make the poll.
[80:55.62]WarioWare.
[81:03.65]Alright.
[81:04.95]Please vote on this poll when you get a chance here.
[81:13.69]We'll see what you guys want to do.
[81:19.55]Devil's third.
[81:20.13]We could have gave that a little bit more of a chance.
[81:23.01]I mean, I know it sucked.
[81:30.57]It sucked, but there was some charm to it.
[81:34.85]Wait, what?
[81:36.91]So you guys want to go from dumb shitty game to dumb shitty game?
[81:43.70]Oh, yeah, get, Jerma, get the fuck off this dumb shit game.
[81:47.12]Uh, play more dumb shit games.
[81:51.76]Alright.
[82:00.74]I would love a full playthrough.
[82:01.82]Maybe we'll go back to it one day.
[82:10.73]Alright, it looks like I have just random WiiWare games that I have installed.
[82:16.16]I think like years ago, like two years ago or something, I was gonna make videos on them.
[82:21.50]And some of these might even actually be in videos.
[82:26.30]Alright, polls closing in 10 seconds.
[82:34.02]What the hell am I even gonna name the title of the stream?
[82:37.38]I don't know, like WiiWare?
[82:40.45]I can't even, like, title the broadcast or anything.
[82:46.11]Can I just, like, what if, like, Wii Sports, Wii Casual?
[82:51.45]Wii Casual?
[82:52.23]I don't even know.
[82:54.12]Alright, I'm just going to do Wii Casual.
[82:55.28]I have no idea what that is, but that's not the game.
[82:59.72]But we're playing Wii Casual at this point.
[83:05.24]Alright, thank you for voting.
[83:06.22]We're closing it.
[83:06.76]Looks like we're going to play the stupid, shitty WiiWare games I have.
[83:10.27]Thank you for voting.
[83:12.39]Let's select it.
[83:14.49]Hold on, move this out of the way.
[83:17.49]Gotta do some moving around here.
[83:19.15]Hold on.
[83:24.96]Is this even being picked up?
[83:26.56]No, it's not turned on.
[83:27.26]Okay.
[83:31.53]Can you see it?
[83:34.73]All right, we.
[83:36.77]TV only.
[83:43.39]Next, we haven't even started.
[83:44.69]It hasn't even started.
[83:45.33]Is this going to come up on stream?
[83:49.71]Is this going to be like dragged across the screen, probably?
[83:53.61]Uh oh.
[83:57.30]Hello?
[83:59.82]Yeah, trust me there.
[84:01.58]Oh, there we go.
[84:02.00]There's a signal.
[84:07.97]Oh, it's a little fucked up.
[84:10.29]Some of these games I don't think I've ever played.
[84:12.87]They're years old.
[84:14.19]Let me just stretch this out a little so it fills the screen.
[84:26.96]Come on, OBS, don't do this to me now.
[84:39.89]Okay.
[84:41.77]What are we playing first?
[84:43.59]Oh, Fast Draw Showdown.
[84:44.97]I remember this one.
[84:47.03]Oh, God.
[84:47.63]Everyone.
[84:48.55]Alright, let's do first.
[84:50.73]We're going to start with Stop Stress.
[84:56.39]Did I make videos on these games besides this one?
[84:58.58]I don't think so.
[84:59.52]Stop Stress.
[85:03.20]A Day of Fury.
[85:07.74]Okay.
[85:08.86]Please allow adequate room.
[85:09.83]Do not hit your little brother or knock your mother's vase over.
[85:12.27]I got it.
[85:18.39]Abby Light Productions.
[85:23.70]Stop stress.
[85:32.34]Big traffic jam.
[85:35.63]Nightmare wake up.
[85:38.99]Like this one.
[85:50.32]Why do I have this?
[85:51.77]I must have wanted to make a video on it or something.
[85:54.97]And it is really loud.
[86:08.57]Break all the windows and escape from the hellish traffic jam.
[86:12.41]Okay.
[86:18.15]How do I attack?
[86:19.41]How do I move?
[86:23.23]Oh, that's how you move.
[86:26.63]What is going on?
[86:27.25]Oh, I have to actually swing the Wiimote.
[86:32.41]This is horrible.
[86:38.11]Okay, a grenade just came out of that car.
[86:39.67]Okay.
[86:53.71]I don't think I can play this anymore.
[86:55.64]Oh, look.
[86:55.92]He farted.
[86:57.90]A bee.
[87:05.29]You would not believe how hard this is to move around.
[87:10.51]These little people that come and attack you.
[87:21.92]I'm not feeling relaxed.
[87:22.84]Why don't you throw a banana at me?
[87:30.56]Alright, some...
[87:35.65]There is a gorilla in a traffic jam here, guys.
[87:52.14]Can this be over yet?
[87:54.10]This is what you guys wanted!
[87:56.10]You guys wanted this!
[88:09.65]All right, I win.
[88:20.06]Get the fuck out of here.
[88:24.94]No, it's not.
[88:25.60]No, it's not.
[88:26.18]This is an improvement.
[88:27.58]Oh, wow.
[88:28.98]Wait, what?
[88:31.90]All right, well, that and... I guess we'll do Dragon Master.
[88:39.01]Let me turn this down a little.
[88:41.64]It is fairly insanely loud.
[88:44.86]Is that better?
[88:48.44]Probably not.
[88:49.08]Dragon Master Spellcaster.
[89:01.21]Fast draw.
[89:01.79]I'm going to play fast draw.
[89:02.79]We're going to end the stream with fast draw.
[89:07.54]Somebody said I used to have this game.
[89:11.86]Alright, options.
[89:12.44]There's options here.
[89:16.00]Audio.
[89:17.78]Okay, you can either turn shit off or on.
[89:20.16]There's no... Okay, you just... Off or on.
[89:24.59]Great.
[89:25.01]Play.
[89:26.85]Training mode.
[89:27.79]Flight mode.
[89:28.51]Combat mode.
[89:29.41]Story mode.
[89:31.27]Story mode.
[89:31.77]Just like your champion.
[89:34.53]Earth champion.
[89:43.83]Who cares?
[89:44.27]Go.
[89:44.59]Three, two, one.
[89:47.78]Fight.
[89:48.08]I don't know how to turn.
[89:58.58]Oh, there we go.
[90:03.10]Is this something I should be doing here with the Wiimote?
[90:04.86]I don't know.
[90:05.98]That's a giant blast.
[90:15.80]Why am I playing these right now?
[90:18.14]And why did I download this?
[90:23.98]I'm gonna stop moving.
[90:24.88]Ah, there we go.
[90:25.34]I got it.
[90:25.62]I think I got it.
[90:26.16]I think I figured it out.
[90:27.70]I think I haven't... No, I didn't figure it out.
[90:32.36]What a great story.
[90:39.90]Something ain't right, that's for sure.
[90:49.90]Okay.
[90:50.88]Why is this just the Christmas stream again?
[90:54.50]That was like, we're doing the Christmas stream again.
[90:57.98]Except this is like two years later.
[91:05.19]Spogs Racing.
[91:08.39]Mart Racer.
[91:10.29]Mart Racer.
[91:15.64]Next.
[91:16.66]Next.
[91:19.55]Well, I wasn't prepared for this one.
[91:20.94]This is just, this is, apparently these are games I've had on my Wii for, like, ever.
[91:25.94]No Mart Racer file found.
[91:27.34]Do you want to create one?
[91:28.74]Yeah, sure.
[91:29.62]Nintendo Wi-Fi connection.
[91:36.90]Number of players, you can do more than one player in this game.
[91:39.58]Um, the orange market.
[91:42.85]Oh, hold on, okay.
[91:44.31]Accelerate, break.
[91:47.58]Steer and drift.
[91:49.90]God, okay.
[91:50.74]What?
[91:57.00]We're doing this way.
[91:58.44]Fire, turn around.
[91:59.40]Wait, hold on.
[92:02.66]I can be Elvis?
[92:04.18]Alright, we're going to have to be Elvis.
[92:15.32]Collect these items.
[92:19.01]No, you couldn't- More fucking annoying music.
[92:21.19]I don't know why I have this game.
[92:37.62]Whoops, sorry.
[92:48.27]This is so fucking bad, it's not even funny.
[92:54.08]Wait, you can throw shit?
[92:55.88]How do you throw shit?
[93:01.69]Uh oh, my head's blinking.
[93:06.07]What does that mean?
[93:09.87]Yeah, how is this a race?
[93:10.85]Do you collect the supermarket shit faster than everybody else?
[93:25.03]Can somebody do me a favor and find out how much these games are?
[93:27.75]Because I probably paid like $4 or $5 per game.
[93:41.02]Sandy Beach.
[93:48.59]What is Sandy Beach?
[93:56.23]60 bucks that's death that is not 60 bucks 350 Nunchuk required all right Crab battle free play

[94:28.96]I... Did you just make a sand castle?
[94:47.21]Where did my bucket go?
[94:55.12]Hold the B button and scoop with the remote.
[95:08.56]Wait, what?
[95:21.75]All right.
[95:23.85]Grab the shovel.
[95:26.56]Do you guys see a shovel?
[95:35.09]Oh, wait, there's a crab coming.
[95:37.61]No, the crab's gone.
[95:38.89]There's the shovel.
[95:54.33]You just make sand castles, alright.
[96:01.37]Well, might as well try the crab battle, because it's here.
[96:04.95]I miss devil's third.
[96:06.35]Hey, this is a democracy.
[96:10.47]Your hand is so shaky.
[96:11.51]No, it's because I'm standing so close to my fucking desk.
[96:14.59]I can't be that far away from it, otherwise you won't be able to hear me.
[96:21.88]Bring back Devil's Third.

[97:00.13]Okay, hold on.
[97:06.25]This one might be good.
[97:07.81]This one might be good.
[97:10.13]You guys need to have a little faith here.
[97:19.74]Yep.
[97:20.64]You guys thought that these WiiWare games were terrible.
[97:28.12]We just found ourselves a gem here.
[97:33.35]Real life eating content.
[97:34.27]That was just warning me so hard to not eat.
[97:38.07]They're like, please do not eat excessively.
[97:45.83]One slick.
[97:47.81]Did I play this already?
[97:51.03]My guy's name is Slick.
[97:59.05]I must have played this.
[98:00.49]Yeah, I had to if we were going to be this guy.
[98:04.02]Are you sure?
[98:04.56]Yeah, I guess.
[98:08.24]The toss.
[98:08.70]For this match, use the motion shown here to put the food in your mouth.
[98:12.92]Press B to chew the food.
[98:14.06]Don't bite your tongue.
[98:16.01]Watch your barf-o-meter.
[98:17.27]Hold and shake A with a Wi

[98:56.73]Oh, it burped in her face.
[98:57.81]Alright, good.
[99:01.43]This is fucking terrible.
[99:05.71]I'm winning though.
[99:12.01]Quick, burp in her face!
[99:16.46]Laugh track too.
[99:19.00]What a painful experience.
[99:24.84]Why does this exist?
[99:41.98]Did I win?
[99:42.52]Did I win?
[99:47.12]What?
[99:48.58]I ate way more than she did.
[100:03.64]One more try.
[100:04.27]We're going to do it with Eric.
[100:10.27]Let's win this one.
[100:12.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[100:15.83]Oh, you can't puke.
[100:16.71]Alright, I get it, I get it.
[100:17.63]Let's go.
[100:19.71]I'm not going to throw up this time.
[100:21.81]Guaranteed.
[100:22.23]I want to see what the next level is.
[100:25.07]That's important.
[100:33.99]Come on, eat it.
[100:34.57]It's like a rhythm game.
[100:40.60]I just bit my mouth.
[100:41.54]Okay.
[100:42.16]Come on.
[100:43.40]Seriously.
[100:44.12]Please.
[100:48.65]Just burp in her face and get this fucking over with, please.
[100:55.31]Settle the stomach.
[100:57.54]I'm doing it.
[101:07.87]Settle, settle, settle.
[101:08.71]Alright, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[101:10.83]I understand, I understand.
[101:14.27]The people that are just coming into this stream right now, I am so sorry you're watching this.
[101:19.04]I am embarrassed that this is fucking on my stream right now.
[101:22.10]Like, I couldn't be more embarrassed.
[101:28.44]Come on, shake that stomach.
[101:29.67]I. I want to see the next level.
[101:33.61]If you came here, I'm so sorry.
[101:39.37]What a terrible fucking thing to walk into.
[101:44.29]I'm kicking her ass right now.
[101:46.03]Just don't puke.
[101:53.45]I love the punch sound effect when you do that.
[101:59.16]Okay, I can just be easy.
[102:00.30]She's breathing fire at me.
[102:02.32]That doesn't seem fair.
[102:05.54]These rounds last way too long, by the way.
[102:07.48]My god.
[102:13.95]What a lowbrow streamer.
[102:15.37]I think I'm going to leave.
[102:16.43]I'm so sorry.
[102:17.51]That's not my intention.
[102:19.69]We were playing a highbrow game earlier.
[102:21.69]The Devil's Start is not a highbrow game.
[102:23.17]What am I talking about?
[102:28.93]Alright, just chill.
[102:30.21]I win.
[102:38.01]Yeah, alright.
[102:38.79]She only ate 38 meatballs.
[102:39.69]I ate 53 meatballs.
[102:45.48]All right.
[102:46.76]I just want to see.
[102:48.02]I just need to see what it is.
[102:52.13]Look at that old guy up there.
[102:53.07]All right.
[102:54.37]What is this one?
[102:56.97]Put food.
[102:57.45]All right.
[102:57.65]This is like burritos.
[103:01.49]Don't bite your tongue.
[103:02.27]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[103:03.13]I get it.
[103:03.57]I get it.
[103:05.01]This one's burritos.
[103:06.47]Why are we still here?
[103:21.94]We're actually still playing this.
[103:31.63]Wonder how much that costs.
[103:32.73]Alright, there's not very many left.
[103:46.98]This one's a great game.
[103:48.86]We're saving that one.
[103:52.11]Spog's racing.
[103:58.63]No, no, you guys want me to stay on that game?
[104:08.42]You know how long that would have taken to get to the end of that game?
[104:15.72]WarioWare, I could load up WarioWare and play a few levels.
[104:18.78]I'll do that before I end the stream.
[104:25.64]This is not even fucking funny, man.
[104:33.20]This is a virus game.
[104:39.50]I would be concerned if this was on my computer because it probably is a virus game.
[104:58.76]Is that a picture of Gabe Newell's face, by the way?
[105:01.52]On that one in front of me?
[105:06.04]I gotta get close to this.
[105:06.98]I need to see this.
[105:09.54]Why am I slower than everybody else?
[105:16.75]Alright, Gabe Newell.
[105:17.49]Here comes Gabe Newell's face.
[105:31.28]Sick fogs, man.
[105:47.61]See you later.
[105:48.89]This seriously just turned into the Christmas tree.
[105:52.76]And I did not even intend for that to fucking happen.
[105:58.99]Alright.
[106:00.10]It's time for Fast Draw Showdown, the best game here by far.
[106:08.52]This is, I'm not even kidding, seriously.
[106:10.88]Fast Draw Showdown is a fucking fantastic, hysterical, awesome game.
[106:17.35]When did I make the video on this?
[106:18.53]Like, three years ago?
[106:23.47]I don't even know.
[106:24.05]It was a long time ago.
[106:28.62]We're going to relive that video.
[106:30.63]What do you guys say?
[106:32.65]Fishy just gave 50 bucks.
[106:35.99]Thank you so much, Fishy, for the 5,000 bits.
[106:38.17]They say some seriously top quality games here.
[106:42.22]Raise shrug.
[106:43.28]I hope to see you at Toth again next year, big man.
[106:46.70]Always fun hanging here.
[106:49.84]Well, thanks a lot, Fishy.
[106:54.34]If Tip of the Hats is still going on next year, I don't see why it wouldn't be.
[106:58.54]Then yeah, I'll be a part of it for sure.
[107:02.66]Let's dance.
[107:03.29]That's right.
[107:03.69]Let's dance, amigo.
[107:05.53]Dancing Dom.
[107:06.37]You guys ready?
[107:06.97]This is like my favorite fucking game of all time.
[107:12.75]In fact, hopefully it's loud because it better be loud.
[107:14.77]I don't think I got very far in the game.
[107:22.66]It got so hard.
[107:34.74]I'm going to turn this up.
[107:35.54]This is so quiet.
[107:37.88]I remember this.
[108:11.60]Put it back in the holster.
[108:13.72]Oh, this is where the video started.
[108:16.44]Remember?
[108:19.00]Quick draw, fast draw.
[108:21.38]Only on Nintendo Wii, right?
[108:23.02]Something like that.
[108:26.69]We're just going to remake the video.
[108:27.95]I hope you guys are ready.
[108:33.91]All right, let's go to options here.
[108:37.54]Menu music on, crosshair on.
[108:41.48]I can't turn it up.
[108:43.32]Why?
[108:43.60]Oh, maybe I can.
[108:46.35]Let me see.
[108:49.05]One second.
[108:49.71]The stream's going to freak out for a second.

[109:10.09]All right, I get it.
[109:12.92]I remember how to play.
[109:13.68]All right, the first match is versus Crazy Curly.

[110:03.05]I don't think that was... Get out of here, kids!
[110:05.37]I don't think that was in the video.
[110:06.41]Maybe it was.
[110:24.18]You want to do something with that gun?
[110:27.80]It doesn't even make any sound.
[110:28.60]Here's your chance to prove you're one of the best.
[110:31.50]I love this game so much.
[110:38.78]Larry.
[110:39.34]Okay, Lar.
[110:45.86]Honey, I'm home.
[110:53.35]Got her.

[111:01.75]Alright, Slur and Spence.
[111:04.57]I remember that guy.
[111:07.93]What a fucking- I love it.
[111:26.26]I'm dead.
[111:32.06]I didn't know where it was.
[111:34.06]I'm going to have to do this all over again.
[111:36.18]No, quick, quick, quick.
[111:39.88]Options.
[111:41.25]Crosshair on.
[111:41.93]Alright, let's do it again.
[111:44.35]Easy.
[111:47.15]Stinky Steve.
[112:07.52]This is right up your alley.
[112:09.40]Oh, that's the guy that poses for the wedding picture.
[112:10.88]I remember that joke.
[112:17.33]Easy.
[112:17.63]No, we just want to see what they say.
[112:18.81]Hold on.
[112:21.21]I'm going to turn it up even louder.
[112:26.47]Even louder.
[112:32.96]Thanks, Purple.
[112:34.82]This stinks!
[112:39.18]Angry Antonio.
[112:41.90]Let's shake.
[112:42.28]Sel and Samuel.
[112:44.22]Oh, yes, the dweeb.
[112:47.73]I think you're going to need it.
[113:14.63]You can do something with that gun!
[113:18.71]The guy didn't even have any bullets, that's awesome.
[113:26.69]He's gonna shoot the ground.
[113:38.30]Oh, fuck!
[113:38.66]I forgot you have to shoot him twice!
[113:39.56]Nope.
[113:39.94]Okay, I got him.
[113:41.46]Nice shooting.
[113:42.62]Real nice shooting.
[113:47.53]Alright, time for TNT Tommy.
[113:51.09]Get out of here, you kids!
[113:54.07]I've got me some dynamite.
[113:56.81]But I don't need it to blow you away.
[114:02.10]That guy's one of my favorites.
[114:03.34]I love that.
[114:03.88]Just, get out of here, kids!
[114:06.81]The funny thing is he threw the Dynavite over where the kids were.
[114:19.71]Here's your chance to prove you're one of the best.
[114:22.87]70.

[114:40.32]We gotta get to the harder ones.
[114:41.68]The harder ones are almost impossible.
[114:43.36]I remember trying to beat one and it was like you had to be like point six.
[114:50.67]Look at this guy.
[114:51.63]I just shot my lawyer.
[114:54.75]It's been a pretty good day so far.

[115:55.33]1.5 seconds, crazy curly.
[116:14.43]Hell yeah, that guy.
[116:16.96]Dangerous death, 1.5 seconds.
[116:26.28]Did not even shoot her in the neck.
[116:29.02]Hopefully she's dead, yeah.
[116:30.66]Is this the game?
[116:33.68]This is one of the games we're playing.
[116:36.74]Junction Jack, okay, one second.
[116:40.38]I don't like your look!
[116:41.44]I gotta get up in the hat.
[116:43.67]Put it back in the holster.
[116:45.55]I got- he has to say the line.
[116:46.59]I don't like your look!
[116:50.07]That's a foul.
[116:51.35]Next time, we'll wait for the signal.
[116:52.95]Fuck.
[116:56.12]Wha- whoa, what?
[116:58.54]What just happened?
[117:04.12]I forget.
[117:06.88]This is convenient.
[117:10.57]Who's the guy you just shoot?
[117:11.85]I don't know.
[117:16.27]I forget.
[117:17.31]That guy too, right?
[117:18.09]That guy too?
[117:23.13]The firebird.
[117:23.75]He'll cut you up.
[117:24.41]0.98 seconds.
[117:24.83]Yes!
[117:25.11]There he is!
[117:36.96]That guy's fucking fantastic.
[117:38.50]It's just getting fun.
[117:39.82]Wait, what?
[117:41.42]So your mom will let you come out and play today.
[117:43.78]Hey, have a nice day.
[117:51.64]All right, wait.
[117:58.31]Round three, match two.

[118:09.94]I think they're just getting harder.
[118:14.40]Dangerous dab, yep.
[118:22.17]I almost just lost.
[118:22.85]Because I like fucking looked over there.
[118:24.89]Apparently stop stress is eight bucks.

[118:32.49]Honest to god, I am not doing anything.
[118:34.68]I swear to god.
[118:45.89]I didn't get his hat.
[118:52.02]I didn't get his hat.
[119:12.98]Actually, it's pretty difficult to hit somebody in the face or in their hat.
[119:16.18]There's the barber in Ares again.
[119:18.44]I almost lost that one.
[119:27.78]Nice shooting.

[123:52.47]This is probably the greatest guy in the game.

[124:03.28]And your time has come.

[124:46.34]I remember that.
[124:47.48]Round six.
[124:49.39]This is where I lose, I think.
[124:50.29]Slick Willy.
[124:50.57]That was really easy for being round six.
[125:14.03]Alright, so this is what I'm talking about.
[125:15.21]Ready?
[125:16.47]Ulster Harry, 0.58 seconds.
[125:19.17]I have not gotten that the entire time we've been playing.
[125:26.37]You call a cab?
[125:33.72]Like, fucking Jesus Christ.
[125:36.58]That is so hard to do that.
[125:37.88]Hey, Larry!
[125:38.52]It's alright.
[125:45.27]Let's dance, amigo!
[125:51.71]Oh, it's too hard.
[125:54.23]God damn it.
[125:59.68]I'm good.
[126:01.52]Then I'm bad.
[126:03.10]You're ugly.
[126:03.80]Nice shot.
[126:04.32]Now host that iron and try the bad.
[126:16.10]It's fucking impossible, dude.
[126:17.58]It's not possible.
[126:20.50]Do you see how fucking impossible this shit is?
[126:24.80]Moppin' Mike.
[126:27.36]I'm gonna clean this town up.
[126:36.81]Oh, just barely.
[126:42.59]One-armed Jack.
[126:49.20]Nah, you wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would you?
[126:57.11]Don't stop now.
[126:57.91]It was just getting fun.
[126:59.29]Fuck.
[127:02.27]Ah, it's alright.
[127:02.98]We'll try it again.
[127:03.64]One more time.
[127:04.56]Nice day.
[127:10.02]For a funeral.
[127:13.87]The thing is, when you bring up the Wiimote, when I bring it up like this, it's so hard to even determine where it's going to even be on the screen.
[127:19.67]You know what I'm talking about?
[127:21.69]Like, I have to point it down at the ground, and then bring it up.
[127:24.23]Oh, shit!
[127:24.61]Where is it?
[127:25.00]4.58 seconds.
[127:29.42]Not fucking possible.
[127:37.30]Like, it... It's really... I don't think it's actually possible.
[127:42.74]On the Wii.
[127:46.31]Let's dance, amigo!
[127:49.95]Oh my god, fucking damn it.
[127:53.85]It's not, it's... I'm good.
[127:59.35]Then I'm bad.
[128:00.93]You're ugly.
[128:01.71].56 is like the fastest thing I've ever done.
[128:08.49]Even if you bring it up.
[128:17.76]It's too fast.
[128:20.44]And if you do it too early, he goes, put it back in the fucking holster.
[128:25.23]How many times do I have to tell you?
[128:28.55]Put it back in the holster.
[128:32.31]I'm going to clean this town up.
[128:44.01]Wait till it says draw.
[128:45.01]No, the second I see green, I pull it up.
[128:50.29]The problem is like, where is it gonna be on the screen when I go like this?
[128:55.88]Nah, you wouldn't shoot an unarmed man, would you?
[128:58.82]This guy just fucked with you.
[129:07.71]You should have been faster.
[129:08.95]God damn it.
[129:10.07]All right, I'm gonna give this one more try.
[129:12.85]Nice day.
[129:15.95]For a funeral.
[129:25.78]I don't even know what the fuck that was.
[129:27.44]Ah, all right, shh.
[129:29.80]You call a cab?
[129:37.10]Got him.
[129:37.42]You're the designated driver.
[129:41.41]That was so lucky.
[129:42.65]Alright, now just don't fuck it up and I'll be okay.
[129:45.61]Dancing Dom's gonna die too.
[129:46.67]I've never killed him.
[129:47.37]Ever.
[129:50.74]Let's dance, amigo!
[129:56.66]Got him.
[130:00.74]Aw, come on.
[130:01.12]I've never seen round seven.
[130:02.16]I'm good.
[130:06.31]And I'm bad.
[130:09.21]You're ugly.
[130:11.72]What he shot?
[130:14.48]What?
[130:15.80]What the fuck?
[130:16.58]He didn't shoot.
[130:17.26]He shoots first.
[130:18.44]Not that, not him.
[130:19.42]Oh my fucking god, it's over.
[130:22.26]I can't believe it.
[130:24.75]I say...
[130:42.67]That's such bullshit.
[130:48.16]Man, that would have been perfect too.
[130:51.06]Unbelievable.
[130:52.66]That's seriously fucking unbelievable.
[130:55.30]What a joke.
[130:58.27]I have to try this again.
[130:59.25]Nice day.
[131:04.17]For a funeral.
[131:08.51]That's such horse shit, I can't even believe it.
[131:14.27]Nice shot, yeah.
[131:17.55]This is the hardest guy.
[131:19.63]God damn it.
[131:31.35]Fucking god damn it.
[131:33.63]I got just like tricked and that's the only reason why I lost.
[131:53.78]You call a cab?
[131:55.06]God.
[131:56.42]Give me a break.
[132:07.52]I play some WarioWare right now.

[134:34.20]And that was Renegade Coaster, by the way.
[134:35.64]They gave the $30 like an hour ago.
[134:39.73]I'm so glad that we played that game.
[134:41.93]That is such a classic, dumb fucking game.
[134:44.77]I can change my Twitch name now.
[134:46.19]Smooth moves.
[135:30.32]Louder oh, I'll fix it.
[135:32.14]I'll fix it.
[135:32.52]I'll fix it.
[135:32.90]I'll fix it.
[135:33.30]I'm gonna fix it.
[135:34.14]I'm gonna fix it everybody hold on There we go he fixed it see he fixed it
[135:52.17]See?
[135:52.69]Alright, single player.
[135:55.23]I have already played WarioWare many times.
[135:58.65]So, we're not going to use that profile.
[136:00.45]We're going to do this.
[136:01.11]Let's call this one J2.
[136:21.14]Are you left-handed or right-handed?
[136:22.22]Right-handed.
[136:22.68]Yeah, let's go.
[136:33.30]Form baton.
[136:38.00]Well, all of those things I'm not doing.
[136:40.62]Just if you guys are curious.
[136:44.56]I am in a very bad spot.
[136:51.17]Alright, let's do it.
[136:51.88]We're going here.
[136:52.88]Watch me fucking destroy this game, by the way, guys.
[136:55.24]You're talking about, like, a master of, like, ADD video games.
[137:01.54]It's me.
[137:09.30]I'm going to crush this game.
[137:20.58]Always use the wrist strap.
[137:23.00]That's uncomfortable, I don't like it.
[137:51.27]Here we go.
[137:51.75]I love the explanation.
[137:56.51]Why didn't they make one of these for the Wii U?
[138:22.20]Focus.
[138:23.70]Got it.
[138:26.02]You guys thought I wasn't gonna kill this?
[138:32.12]Sautéed.
[138:33.28]For the little... the little... the little kid.
[138:42.25]They kinda did.
[138:42.83]Yeah, but it wasn't that good.
[138:43.67]It was... wasn't it like only 12 games?
[139:00.97]Got it.
[139:06.64]Come on, Wiimote, what are you doing?
[139:07.74]The Wiimote fucked up.
[139:09.54]Fucking Wiimote sucks.
[139:31.98]Whooo!
[139:39.04]Easy.
[139:40.66]Not a big deal at all.
[139:41.61]Do you think they just ran out of ideas?
[139:57.65]Because they could have had a Wii U version.
[140:00.21]They have this whole gamepad thing and all that.
[140:02.59]How do you not make a follow-up?
[140:04.94]They must have just been like, huh.
[140:06.88]I guess we have somebody getting their nose picked a bunch of times.
[140:09.14]What else can we do?
[140:09.90]We're gonna go right to Mona.
[140:24.00]Hello, Mona.
[140:29.22]It's still loud.
[140:41.88]Don't you like to deliver a pizza?
[140:44.00]Is this Pizza Girl or is there another pizza?
[141:02.63]It should be pretty good bit rate right now, actually.
[141:21.16]Oh, the high school romance.
[141:28.26]Let's do it.
[141:34.79]I love the little cartoon characters.
[141:36.97]They're so cute.
[141:39.71]Hold on.
[141:43.66]Let me lower it a little bit more.
[141:47.02]Like another 5 or 10%.
[141:47.76]It's going to have to restart.
[141:49.16]Hold on.
[141:52.10]Sorry about this, guys.
[141:56.72]The umbrella.
[141:59.90]Hopefully it picks it up.
[142:09.53]Full playthrough?
[142:10.47]I don't know.
[142:13.93]I got it, right?
[142:16.82]Yeah.
[142:20.70]Ride the bike.
[142:22.08]Gonna move myself back a little bit here.
[142:38.76]Sorry, this might be a little loud.
[142:39.82]Oh fuck, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[142:42.72]Problem, problem, problem, problem.
[142:44.86]Pump it!
[142:45.78]I'm moving shit too quickly.
[142:51.34]There we go.
[142:57.16]I got it.
[142:58.58]Louder.
[143:00.99]Not louder.
[143:09.63]Go Diamond City.
[143:10.99]Faster, faster, faster, faster.
[143:27.19]Did I do it wrong?
[143:29.65]Oh fuck, I was supposed to close him in.
[143:30.97]I was supposed to close it afterwards.
[143:40.15]It's too quiet?
[143:41.86]What did I do?
[143:45.18]Honestly, okay, I know what the issue is here.
[143:48.96]Going forward with the Wii mode, I'm too close.
[143:53.06]I'm way too close.
[143:54.44]How do I back it up?
[143:55.14]I can't back up.
[143:57.64]I have to stand this close.
[144:15.37]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[144:17.05]Blue, right?
[144:17.43]Blue?
[144:18.07]You go that way.
[144:19.81]Blue?
[144:30.49]Alright, that was easy.
[144:31.91]Easy.
[144:32.23]Oh, look at the doge.
[144:58.93]Oh, he's thinking about Mona.
[145:00.45]Aww, how cute.
[145:02.69]I thought that was a chainsaw for one second.
[145:31.50]That opened up.
[145:34.04]Oh, I forget what those two are.
[145:36.56]I remember that one.
[145:39.97]All right, where are we going?
[145:43.79]Let's go to this one.
[145:45.95]Cat and Ana.
[145:53.97]Oh, that's Katana.
[145:54.91]Yeah, right.
[146:01.13]I'll go on the other profile and do insanity mode if you guys want me to do that.
[146:12.37]My best score is like a hundred and something on insanity mode.
[146:35.82]Let's do it.
[146:42.14]Did it say filthy?
[146:46.12]God, this is going to be so hard to do this with this shit.
[146:52.22]I need to like... We're moving back even further.
[146:55.08]I ain't fucking this one up.
[146:58.63]Hold on.
[146:59.05]I hope I don't rip my microphone out of its cord.
[147:04.24]Son of a... Alright, well, you guys aren't gonna be able to hear me very well.
[147:07.44]A+.
[147:13.62]A+.
[147:27.70]The chauffeur.
[147:29.66]Turn the four batons sideways and wrap your hands around both ends.
[147:34.80]As the four batons... It's where you, like, drive cars.
[147:37.30]So too do the earth and all upon it.
[147:40.83]You can hear me fine.
[147:41.43]You can win them all the way back here.
[147:44.69]All right.
[147:45.19]I'll take your word for it.
[147:50.35]Can you give me something harder, game?
[148:02.31]Oh look, it's a pizza!
[148:05.56]I almost fucked that one up.
[148:10.08]Oh, fucking hold on!
[148:28.11]I completely forgot that that one existed.
[148:30.29]Hopefully this still works.
[148:32.89]Yeah, it works.
[148:34.17]We're good.
[148:35.79]Because it's not connected to my wrist.
[148:40.62]Well, we're putting it on my wrist now.
[148:43.32]It's going to stay on the wrist now.
[148:52.23]God, I'm backing into so much shit here.
[149:03.03]Nailed it Nailed it Nailed it
[149:38.70]Look at that guy's face.
[149:39.36]It looks like me.
[149:40.98]That was me in like 30 years, by the way, guys.
[149:53.06]You want to get the fucking webcam on?
[149:55.38]Hold on.
[149:55.92]Give me a minute.
[150:00.06]Oh, fuck.
[150:00.60]This is... There we go.
[150:15.87]No, I can't use the webcam because the audio is going to be delayed by like three seconds.
[150:21.74]So I'll be doing sh- I'm going to be doing shit on my webcam.
[150:28.00]It's not going to be synced up.
[150:30.18]I will be like a full four seconds behind my webcam.
[150:34.58]So, not right now.
[150:41.29]Does it matter?
[150:42.09]It kind of matters.
[150:48.00]But you guys aren't going to see my, uh... Isn't that the whole point?
[150:52.74]To see me moving and shit?
[150:54.62]Sync it for me to sync it.
[150:55.37]I'd have to turn off the stream.
[150:57.73]I wasn't preparing to do a face cam tonight.
[151:01.93]Now, how about this?
[151:02.57]How about this?
[151:03.43]I'll prepare a face cam.
[151:06.14]So I don't have to turn off my stream and shit.
[151:10.62]I should... No, maybe I don't have to do that.
[151:12.02]Hold on.
[151:16.35]No, and it's like, you guys aren't going to be able to even see me.
[151:22.70]Just put a pair, here, there you go.
[151:35.82]There.
[151:44.37]How about this?
[151:45.81]Actually, I'm having fun playing this.
[151:47.43]I might just play this tomorrow.
[151:51.09]And I will get a face cam ready to go for tomorrow.
[151:54.71]And I'll play this again tomorrow.
[151:56.53]Because there's a lot more that I'm probably going to play tonight.
[152:03.23]Wow, he's so tall.
[152:04.19]Look at how tall he is.
[152:16.61]Thank you, Badonde.
[152:17.69]101.26 for the sub.
[152:20.95]Purple, thanks for the bits.
[152:22.83]Mighty Baseplate, thanks for the bits as well.
[152:27.37]The 400 bits.
[152:30.14]Sturman985, thank you for the 200.
[152:34.36]Also, the Ameriman sub for seven months.
[152:37.90]I mean more to you than tomatoes and cheese.
[152:39.62]Well, that's a huge thing, dude.
[152:41.38]Thanks for sticking around for as long as you have.
[152:44.94]Unit 2321, thanks for the sub.
[152:47.58]Hoggleboggle, thanks for the sub as well.
[152:49.10]Three months.
[152:53.60]Much love, guys.
[152:54.90]He was too tall to be you.
[152:56.00]That's not getting in the way, is it?
[152:59.64]Oh, fuck.
[152:59.98]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[153:00.54]Pay attention.
[153:00.94]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[153:02.52]This one.
[153:06.26]I was not paying attention.
[153:07.14]I was looking at the other screen.
[153:10.65]The tug of war.
[153:12.62]Am I gonna do clown car videos?
[153:15.10]I'll just... I'll work on it.
[153:16.00]I'll go on my hands and knees.
[153:17.56]Yeah, I'll get a face cam set up for tomorrow.
[153:20.46]We'll play this again tomorrow night.
[153:47.08]The waiter.
[153:47.58]Yeah, this is where you have to... This is why it's attached, because I will drop this.
[153:50.78]Oh no.
[153:51.18]Don't blow it now.
[154:18.00]Waiter?
[154:25.92]Dude, I'm doing like a full body cam tomorrow, you know what I'm saying?
[154:37.22]And you guys can see how bad my posture is while playing this game.
[154:50.95]The little animations remind me of the old school, like, PBS cartoons.
[154:55.15]You know, on Sesame Street, sometimes there'd just be a random cartoon, and they'd always be, like, a different style.
[155:00.37]It's great.
[155:02.08]I love it.
[155:02.40]This might not pick up that well, because of how I'm fucking sitting.
[155:18.44]I'm upside down.
[155:19.64]Yeah.
[155:20.16]I'm hanging upside down right now.
[155:22.25]What the fuck happened?
[155:26.25]It didn't click when I clicked it.
[155:31.57]Weirdo.
[155:33.79]Found the weirdo.
[155:34.35]Woo!
[155:43.88]All right.
[155:46.94]Pump it up.
[155:47.80]Faster.
[155:57.69]Tug-of-war, let's go.
[156:03.88]Got it.
[156:05.80]The Elefante.
[156:11.31]Almost didn't get that right.
[156:13.07]I didn't know what it was asking.
[156:14.01]It said J2, and I said, I don't know who that is.
[156:17.47]The Elefante.
[156:29.48]Stack up.
[156:30.42]This is like Tetris.
[156:46.41]You thought I was gonna... You thought I was gonna shake it.
[156:52.17]I win.
[156:52.61]I win.
[156:52.87]I have the fucking best...
[157:08.77]This is not like Tetris.
[157:10.11]Yeah, this is the falling pieces and they fall down and you collect them.
[157:16.29]I got you guys.
[157:18.61]This is... No, I don't... Turn these all off.
[157:28.16]They're getting in the way.
[157:42.55]Jimmy T. What?
[157:50.58]Sometimes I forget that a lot of you guys might not have been in here when we did that.
[157:55.34]Hey, Mr. Duck Place, thanks for the 10 months.
[157:59.82]Have you been a good boy this year?
[158:01.06]Have you been a good boy this year?
[158:06.69]Yeah, I mean, happy birthday, man.
[158:09.51]Apparently you've been a good boy.
[158:29.99]Unit2321, thanks for the thousand bits, man.
[158:31.83]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[158:36.00]Much love.
[158:48.68]Why didn't Nintendo use more of these characters?
[158:52.81]Don't you feel like this guy is fucking awesome and should have been in more Nintendo games?
[159:01.81]How is he not part of another universe or something?
[159:05.05]Give this guy his own game.
[159:32.31]Put down your iPhone.
[159:33.05]It's time for bed.
[159:33.81]Oops.
[159:45.93]Is the entire VOD gonna get content ID matched?
[159:48.43]I don't think so.
[159:50.08]Oh, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit!
[159:53.96]I was leaning in too far.
[159:59.38]At least technically they're not like
[160:01.87]I guess there are copyright songs, but... I know, the cats are fine!
[160:09.29]It's like sorcery all over again.
[160:32.95]Don't freak it out, you're fine.
[160:34.23]Good, good, good.
[160:35.21]I love how that makes a volcano erupt.
[160:44.66]This is where they make it a little bit harder.
[161:02.92]Rennie just wanted her con!
[161:06.12]Almost didn't get that.
[161:15.77]It's a good thing there's no face cam because my face right there would have been fucking terrifying.
[161:46.22]Don't fuck it up.
[161:49.34]D minus?
[161:49.88]No, I get like a 75, man.
[161:51.72]Easy game.
[162:07.53]Give cam, give cam.
[162:08.54]We're going to get a cam tomorrow.
[162:10.86]We'll do a cam tomorrow night.
[162:13.63]That way you can watch me make odd faces when I jerk this thing around in the air.
[162:44.93]This game's hurting my mind.
[162:46.19]This game is fantastic.
[162:49.55]I love this game.
[163:10.53]Here's your umbrella.
[163:12.95]Thank you, little cat.
[163:25.42]That's... If I remember that... Is that pizza?
[163:27.70]No, that's... That's Ashley, right?
[163:33.64]Where's the Game Boy guy?
[163:36.18]Little game kid.
[163:36.92]Alright, let's do it.
[163:45.92]Uh... We'll go to... Ashley, Ashley, Ashley, Ashley?
[163:50.62]You want me to do Ashley?
[163:51.44]Okay.
[163:53.56]Okay.
[164:08.70]Wait, there's a song here, right?
[164:10.32]Don't they sing a song?
[164:16.22]And here she comes, it's Ashmee.
[164:18.65]Something like that, right?
[164:21.57]She makes the pizza, puts it inside of the oven.
[164:24.83]I don't even know how it goes.
[164:25.69]You know how it goes.
[164:32.08]Inside the light.
[164:33.18]Wait, they're not singing that part.
[165:06.72]The singing's in the DS game?
[165:08.24]Let's find out.
[165:14.89]I guess not, yeah.
[165:25.46]Abysmal.
[165:25.70]Thanks to the 400 bits unit.
[165:26.48]They say, love you, Bill Burr.
[165:28.22]I'm not Bill Burr.
[165:28.74]Although Bill Burr is very funny.
[165:30.88]Yeah.
[165:31.02]Hey, there's the pizza.
[165:32.44]Was there a pizza?
[165:56.11]I don't have a table.
[166:02.79]There's no table here.
[166:04.99]I'm gonna have to put it on my knee.
[166:06.51]Oh shit, I'm gonna fail every single one of these.
[166:08.52]Okay, it's on my leg.
[166:09.38]Hello, how are you?
[166:26.04]Hello!
[166:26.40]Little rascal, let's do it!
[166:37.32]Wicked.
[166:38.50]Did you say wicked?
[166:53.59]The big cheese.
[166:55.01]The Dr. Roker.
[166:55.95]Put the baton back in the holster.
[166:58.41]I thought I failed that.
[167:01.11]I'm not even sure how that would be possible.
[167:23.89]Do you call a cab?
[167:29.93]Oh shit, discard.
[167:30.65]Let it go.
[167:33.53]Whoo!
[167:39.23]This is why we need face cam.
[167:40.31]I promise I'll do it tomorrow.
[167:47.00]I just like gyrated.
[167:48.20]I didn't even jump.
[167:48.88]That was great.
[167:55.34]What?
[167:55.48]Oh.
[167:55.58]You need to know what the shape is.
[167:58.52]Alright, here we go!
[168:12.42]Fast draw showdown!
[168:26.72]Here comes the boss.
[168:38.35]What do I have to do here?
[168:39.91]Take it?
[168:42.43]When is it... When it becomes a hamburger.
[168:44.69]A done hamburger.
[168:45.43]Got it.
[168:46.57]That was a very, very easy boss fight.
[169:02.10]Watch out.
[169:23.75]Watch out.
[169:29.16]Alright, now we're going to do insanity mode.
[169:34.06]Yeah, I had to pick it up when it was done.
[169:40.73]Actually, can you go back and do them and just try to time trial them in a sense?
[169:44.23]Alright, let's go back and let's do my other account.
[169:51.72]I just want to see if I still got it, you know what I mean?
[169:58.05]Uh, what are you doing?
[169:58.79]Train station.
[170:00.55]There we go.
[170:05.80]Take a look at this.
[170:06.32]Look at this, like, completionist.
[170:09.46]Alright, where is it?
[170:11.28]All mixed up.
[170:12.28]Sudden death.
[170:13.60]Rilling.
[170:14.30]Super.
[170:14.66]Alright, super hard.
[170:15.86]You guys ready?
[170:18.28]Here we go.
[170:22.39]Super hard.
[170:22.97]You guys ready for this fucking nonsense?
[170:24.29]Let's do it.
[170:31.68]I'm gonna be dead silent for this one.
[170:44.34]Got it!
[171:11.99]to that Metroid reference.
[171:20.13]Huh?
[171:21.87]I didn't know, what?
[171:23.45]Apparently I didn't.
[171:25.26]Swim it!
[171:30.18]Squat, you fucker!
[171:31.46]What?
[171:47.67]One more time.
[172:19.05]Wait, do I collect any?
[172:19.99]Oh, I got two.
[172:29.85]Oh my fucking god, give me a break.
[172:58.71]I just, like, hurt my ankle.
[173:01.41]I didn't even fucking mean to do that.
[173:04.93]Ow.
[173:05.91]Where's the weirdo?
[173:06.91]It's me!
[173:07.23]I'm the fucking weirdo!
[173:36.42]I even lifted it up too.
[173:37.22]It's because of my leg.
[173:37.94]It's not going to happen.
[173:41.50]That shit ain't going to happen when it's on my leg.
[173:43.30]I need a better fucking setup to do it.
[173:47.10]Did I just like fuck up so bad my phone rang?
[173:50.12]Oh no.
[173:56.50]Good thing there's no face cam.
[173:58.74]Well, there'll be a face cam tomorrow.
[174:06.12]20 points?
[174:06.70]I'm so close.
[174:07.56]I'll get 25 tomorrow night for sure.
[174:11.08]I'll be prepared tomorrow night.
[174:12.49]I'm going to have the cam set up.
[174:19.37]I'll be ready to rock.
[174:27.54]Can't shoot her.
[174:28.12]Let's give it a try.
[174:31.48]Yeah, I kind of want to save this game for the...
[174:37.13]Yeah, I want to save this game until I have the face cam tomorrow.
[174:40.03]I feel like it'd be more fun that way.
[174:41.11]Alright, let's do one... Let's do one run of Super Mario Bros.
[174:50.26]We'll do one expert run of Mario Maker.
[174:57.86]And see what happens.
[175:09.36]We did everybody's requests tonight.
[175:16.08]Go back to the western shooter.
[175:26.21]I played a lot of games tonight, huh?
[175:31.23]I missed Devil's Third.
[175:32.17]We never had to leave it.
[175:36.05]I was told by the chat that that game was not worth watching.
[175:41.17]So we moved on.
[175:47.55]What is it?
[175:48.58]10 Mario Challenge?
[175:49.20]Which one is it?
[175:51.02]Let me move some stuff around while we do this.
[175:52.50]We'll do one expert run and then I'll probably take off for tonight.
[175:57.36]10 Mario Challenge, right?
[176:00.82]Then you do expert, right?
[176:02.32]No, no, no.
[176:02.66]That's not it.
[176:06.51]It's 100-Man Mario, isn't it?
[176:13.49]How do you get there?
[176:23.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[176:24.37]It's fine.
[176:29.79]Okay, there it is.
[176:30.40]100-Man Mario.
[176:35.74]Alright, what the fuck is going on right now?
[176:37.30]100 Mario Challenge on Expert.
[176:49.45]I wonder if I can do it.
[177:00.62]I'm not going to get past the first level, guys, by the way.
[177:03.12]I'm just warning you all.
[177:07.55]Unless I get real lucky.
[177:08.65]I don't remember how to play Mario.
[177:12.11]How do you even play this game?
[177:23.06]Already dead.
[177:28.46]I'm so fucking bad at Mario 2.
[177:30.38]This is not gonna go well.
[177:32.84]Why did I even decide to do this?
[177:36.09]I should've just made some snacks on camera.
[177:42.53]Are you shitting me right now?
[177:49.08]No fucking way.
[177:51.42]What the fuck am I supposed to do here?
[177:57.59]What?
[178:02.09]I'm not gonna be able to beat this.
[178:04.01]Are you shitting me?
[178:06.34]There's not a chance in hell that I'll beat this.
[178:09.20]Would you guys rather watch me make like fucking mashed potatoes?
[178:18.68]How do I skip this level?
[178:25.53]How do you twirl?
[178:26.57]Do you have to shake?
[178:33.83]How did that just happen?
[178:36.52]okay uh I have to flick my wiimote in the air to do that oh jesus this is not gonna go well there's a there's a ground there's a ground I didn't see the ground all right never mind I see I didn't know that I did not see the ground
[179:10.66]I need to wait.
[179:12.36]Should have waited.
[179:16.58]I got this.
[179:24.87]Bring back the egg.
[179:25.79]I don't know how I didn't see the ground before.
[179:46.97]How do I skip the fucking level?
[179:48.31]Get me out of here.
[179:52.73]Skip, skip it.
[179:53.33]Get me the fuck away from this.
[179:56.69]I haven't played a Mario grade.
[179:57.73]I haven't played a Mario game since I was in the fucking 7th grade.
[180:01.80]I'm gone.
[180:02.40]Fucking skip this one.
[180:03.94]Wait.
[180:04.88]No.
[180:05.36]Don't skip this one.
[180:11.72]Okay.
[180:11.91]What?
[180:13.53]What?
[180:20.06]Oh, this was a little puzzle.
[180:20.94]I like this one.
[180:21.54]Like, do I have to... Anybody understand what the fuck is going on right now?
[180:47.26]Can I, like, slide under there?
[181:02.35]The fuck is going on?
[181:09.11]Step on the bomb.
[181:12.59]Which, what bomb?
[181:13.31]This one?
[181:37.35]I'm done.
[181:41.40]Wait, shoot the big bomb with the fire.
[181:42.98]How do I get over to the... How do I do that?
[181:44.84]Get in there!
[182:14.11]What?
[182:15.17]What the fuck?
[182:23.50]What?
[182:23.70]Alright.
[182:36.96]I don't think that's what I have to do.
[182:45.96]I can only get in there like this, but... No, I... Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[182:52.60]I think I might got it.
[182:53.72]I think I got it.
[182:56.54]I think I have to just kick it and then... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[182:59.76]Let me try this.
[183:07.03]I gotta stand still.
[183:07.97]I gotta get it.
[183:10.33]No, if I... If I played Mario since the 7th fucking grade, maybe I'd be able to do this.
[183:30.73]I can't fucking... Get me the fuck out of here!
[183:35.55]Wait, what?
[183:36.49]I'm done with this shit.
[183:57.38]There's a reason why I don't play Mario Maker.
[183:59.92]Because fuck that game.
[184:06.05]I tried to get, like, in and just step on it and get out.
[184:08.31]I, like, picked the fucking thing up and I couldn't move.
[184:09.97]Suspend point low.
[184:17.95]What?
[184:18.19]I got suspended?
[184:19.19]What happened?
[184:27.21]How do I do this?
[184:35.19]Stop ignoring the command for germa potatoes.
[184:37.29]Why did I buy it?
[184:38.19]I don't know.
[184:38.65]I bought it like... I bought it when it came out like a fucking year ago.
[184:56.77]This is like a DS game.
[184:58.19]I have no idea what the hell I'm doing.
[185:09.74]I gave Devil's Third... Something... No.
[185:11.84]Honestly, something about fucking Super Mario Maker drives me up the goddamn wall.
[185:18.59]That game makes me so angry more than any game I think I've ever played.
[185:22.67]I can't... I hate it.
[185:27.98]The game is like a great game, but I like fucking hate that game.
[185:35.25]It's just something about it, I just can't do it.
[185:37.67]You call me an idiot, call me a moron, call me I suck at Mario, that's fine.
[185:41.53]But fuck Mario Maker.
[185:46.27]What do I have to do?
[185:49.67]Oh my god, what is even happening right now?
[186:00.10]I love how we're looking at a toilet while I'm saying this.
[186:05.70]Why does it keep doing this?
[186:10.11]More than Dark Souls?
[186:10.77]No, I can play Dark Souls.
[186:13.85]By the way, I'm reading chat right now.
[186:14.99]I'm not even playing this game.
[186:19.19]I got in second place.
[186:26.96]I did a full stream of Mario Maker right when it came out.
[186:30.38]And I think it was just as much of a disaster as that was.
[186:39.22]It's such a fucking great game.
[186:40.56]It's such a cool game, too.
[186:43.94]But when I play that game, I really feel like there is a lighter up my ass.
[186:48.85]And that somebody's just holding it down.
[186:54.66]German's reading chat at first.
[186:55.62]What?
[186:55.76]I read chat all the time.
[186:56.44]What are you talking about?
[187:02.22]Get me out of here.
[187:04.96]Let's close out the stream on something.
[187:06.82]Let's close out positive, right?
[187:08.06]How do I get back to my menu?
[187:16.72]Beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[187:20.62]I'll get that ready for tomorrow.
[187:21.42]That'll be fun.
[187:23.20]Make easy levels for me.
[187:26.21]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[187:27.77]All right, we'll close this remote by... What do you say?
[187:37.30]I'm going to turn my Wiimote on.
[187:43.80]Do I fast roll one more time?
[187:44.82]All right, we'll go with fast roll one more time, and then I'll close this remote.
[187:49.02]And tomorrow we'll have a face cam, and we will do more WarioWare.
[188:01.94]We're going to speed run this, by the way.
[188:06.70]Go finish Devil's Third.
[188:07.92]Go back to Devil's Third.
[188:11.80]No.
[188:13.34]Maybe tomorrow I'll do it for a fucking dumb joke.
[188:27.37]WarioWare is the best game.
[188:29.85]You're right.
[188:30.29]It's awesome.
[188:31.88]Wait, what?
[188:34.78]Thank you, Verath.
[188:35.58]Happy holidays to you as well.
[188:38.38]Minxie123, one of our mods.
[188:39.98]Minxie subscribed for 10 months in a row.
[188:43.56]Thanks a lot, Minxie.
[188:45.30]Everyone say hi to Minxie.
[188:46.08]She's a mod.
[188:49.64]Psychotic Snivy.
[188:51.70]Experiment76.
[188:52.46]Plinko45.
[188:53.14]Thanks for the subs, guys.
[188:55.18]And then IanAnimator for 8 months.
[188:57.16]MrDuckPlays for 10 months.
[189:00.46]That's the really good boy.
[189:02.60]Sir Squeegee, what's going in the toilet for six months?
[189:04.68]Thanks a lot.
[189:06.26]Badondy, and I think I already got you, but welcome anyways.
[189:12.09]Magpie, thanks for the 370 that you say.
[189:13.63]Will you ever do Overwatch viewer games again?
[189:16.45]Yeah, I'll do stuff like that.
[189:17.65]Why not?
[189:23.41]Let's do this on hard.
[189:27.22]Let's see how far I can get on hard.
[189:32.93]This is not going to be good.
[189:35.67]Yeah, I like playing games with you guys.
[189:37.58]It's just sometimes it's hard.
[189:38.64]Oh, you get one shot.
[189:39.60]I get it.
[189:44.42]And you don't even get to... Oh boy, that's horrible.
[189:46.98]This node doesn't tell you when to draw and you get one shot.
[189:55.21]I've got no reservations about shooting you.
[190:02.62]How am I supposed to kill him?
[190:06.57]If I have one bullet, how do I kill him?
[190:10.73]That doesn't make any sense.
[190:22.14]Is it too quiet?
[190:22.70]Yeah, I'll change that.
[190:23.32]I'll fix it.
[190:28.76]Turn it up.
[190:32.91]Gotta get him in the head?
[190:33.67]Oh boy.
[190:34.37]That's not gonna happen.
[190:40.98]Gotta shoot him in the head.
[190:44.62]Well, we ain't doing that.
[190:47.62]Normal.
[190:54.65]Get out of here, you kids!
[190:55.51]I think normal just does not have the... I've got me some dynamite.
[191:00.38]But I don't need it to blow you away.
[191:05.80]I'll be shocked if I get passed at the first level here, honestly.
[191:08.64]Now it's so loud.
[191:09.78]What else?
[191:10.32]That's... That's the guy that shit his pants!
[191:17.26]This stinks!
[191:21.24]It's... It's either too loud or too quiet, right?
[191:32.20]Can I cheat?
[191:32.80]I don't think I can cheat in this game.
[191:39.47]I've got no reservation about shooting you.
[191:44.09]What is two player?
[191:45.01]We'll try that before I see what two player is.
[191:49.84]Although I don't have a second Wii mode, so I'm not sure it's going to happen.
[191:55.79]You want to do something with that, Jan?
[192:11.02]Sure picked a nice day to die.
[192:13.95]Fuck.
[192:15.15]Put it back in the holster.
[192:20.65]Sure picked a nice day to die.
[192:23.91]Can I cover the sensor bar?
[192:27.71]No, it's... Just have to... I'm sure you could probably get an emulator or something and skip everything.
[192:35.15]This is right up your alley.
[192:44.46]Nice shooting.
[192:45.62]Real nice shooting.
[192:48.99]Is that guy still alive?
[192:49.83]What do you think?
[192:52.49]When did this original game come out in the arcade?
[192:54.41]Like 1985?
[192:54.65]Like 1990?
[192:54.83]That guy is like 75 years old right now.
[193:14.83]1995?
[193:14.95]Yeah, so this game came out 20 years ago.
[193:16.53]Now it's not loud enough.
[193:18.45]I don't believe you.
[193:45.22]Why am I playing this game again?
[193:46.46]I don't know why I'm playing this game again.
[193:51.75]I just shot my lawyer.
[193:54.87]It's been a pretty good day so far.
[194:01.76]Just was curious to see what he did after he does that.
[194:06.52]Honey, I'm home.
[194:14.45]Almost lost that one too.
[194:16.87]Well, I don't know why I'm doing this right now.
[194:18.95]I gotta like... We've already done this.
[194:23.54]We did this like fucking two hours ago.
[194:25.38]Nice shooting.
[194:30.03]Real nice shooting.
[194:31.09]Thanks.
[194:45.13]It's not the same, right?
[194:48.55]We've already seen everything.
[194:51.35]We're just going till I lose.
[194:56.00]That actually looks like Ed Harris from Westworld.
[195:05.02]Why do I seem like an expert at this shitty arcade game?
[195:07.85]Because this is like the fifth time I've played it.
[195:14.38]Wiimote's fucked up, and I still got him.
[195:20.49]I've seen none of this.
[195:21.83]Well, welcome.
[195:23.15]Rest in peace, partner.
[195:36.10]At least they're up to round eight.
[195:38.47]This is where I lose.
[195:38.95]I'm having a real bad hair day.
[195:41.09]Oh, shit, it does say Mario Maker.
[195:42.95]Oh, fuck.
[195:45.77]It does say Mario Maker.
[195:48.95]Oh, that's fucking stupid.
[195:49.58]Here's your chance to prove you're one of the best.
[195:51.80]Oh, Mario Maker.
[195:52.78]Cool.
[195:54.76]No, you get this game again.
[195:57.06]I played Mario Maker for like maybe four minutes and I just went on a fucking tirade.
[196:02.45]Time to clean up these streets.
[196:13.33]Yeah, look at this new Mario Maker update.
[196:14.77]I gotta get him in the head.
[196:21.15]I got it.
[196:21.70]I got it.
[196:22.22]I got it.
[196:45.84]Uh... at least we got to see it.
[196:47.86]When you absolutely, positively gotta die.
[196:53.66]Uh... Die.
[197:01.36]So your mom won't let you come out and play today.
[197:11.46]Because you guys are great actors.
[197:14.88]It's over.
[197:15.55]I lose.
[197:21.59]That sounds like David Cross.
[197:26.65]In fact, that might even be David Cross.
[197:29.25]I'm done.
[197:33.12]Game over.
[197:36.14]That's it.
[197:41.39]How many times do I have to tell you?
[197:43.17]Put it back in the holster.
[197:47.01]Thelma?
[197:47.83]Louise?
[197:48.43]Louise?
[197:49.86]Who's gonna shoot first?
[197:50.92]Wait, there's no Wiimote.
[197:54.76]It's gone.
[197:55.52]I couldn't even... Don't stop now.
[197:59.34]It was just getting fun.
[198:00.34]That's it.
[198:08.03]I can still hear the music, though, somehow.
[198:13.64]Nope, I don't wanna.
[198:20.52]It's over.
[198:22.74]Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[198:24.94]On this weird Wii U night.
[198:30.88]Tomorrow night, I will get a facecam set up.
[198:32.46]And I'm gonna move some stuff around in this room to make it so it's easier for me to do a facecam stream for WarioWare.
[198:41.82]Yeah, the plan tonight was like, oh, I'm gonna play Devil's Third, and like, maybe something in Devil's Third apparently was so awful, that we had to, uh, try something else.
[198:50.95]But, we'll do more WarioWare tomorrow night, and maybe something else.
[198:54.09]Let me look through my, like, Wii U library.
[198:56.98]Hey!
[198:57.78]You know, could always play Mario Maker.
[199:03.32]You know, why not?
[199:05.18]Sure I'll not fucking flip out at that game.
[199:11.00]Time to go take a shower.
[199:14.70]Yeah, thanks so much, everybody, for hanging out.
[199:15.92]There was actually... There was a lot of people here tonight.
[199:17.42]If you just happened to find the stream, then welcome.
[199:22.00]Hopefully you... Hopefully you're not, like, a huge fan of Mario Maker, because I, like, fucking flipped out at it.
[199:27.31]And this is, like, a lie, because I'm not even playing Mario Maker right now.
[199:31.15]So I'm very sorry about that.
[199:33.31]But, hi.
[199:34.97]Welcome.
[199:35.47]Thanks for sticking around, everybody.
[199:37.27]A blue ape for 900 bits right at the end here.
[199:39.11]Keep... Put it back in the holster.
[199:42.37]I don't think I'll ever get past round six, ever.
[199:47.37]Yeah, good night, guys.
[199:51.09]Thank you also to Unit.
[199:52.45]Unit gave another 400 bits earlier as well.
[199:55.01]And for real, though, with bits too.
[199:56.15]Thank you, guys.
[199:58.05]Did I miss any subs?

[200:18.15]Ends with the monkey closing the book.
[200:20.91]It could if he wanted it to.
[200:23.24]But goodnight, everybody.
[200:24.14]Goodnight, everybody.
[200:25.38]I've got to learn how to talk better.
[200:27.82]But much love.
