[00:01.89]Yes, yes, I know that you were expecting Christmas dinner tonight, and instead you walked in the door, hung your coat up, you looked around the room, looked around the kitchen, and there was nothing in the oven.
[00:20.89]There was no trays out with foil on them.
[00:26.03]There was no atmosphere that there was any food.
[00:32.58]And you were told now when you came in, yes, we're going to be having microwaved pizzas tonight.
[00:44.40]Hello.
[00:45.02]Hi, how are you?
[00:47.70]Welcome.
[00:48.68]Welcome to the stream.
[00:54.20]Some of you may be confused by the title and the game that's on that title.
[01:03.38]And a lot of you might be wondering, man, what does that microphone sure does sound better, doesn't it?
[01:08.92]That sounds a lot different.
[01:10.04]That sounds much cleaner, doesn't it?
[01:13.06]I'd like to ones in chat.
[01:15.12]If you can tell me if it sounds very clean and very new and refreshing to you.
[01:26.25]Alright.
[01:27.43]So let me tell you what I did.
[01:31.29]Finally, finally, finally.
[01:33.01]I know, I know.
[01:33.55]Finally.
[01:35.19]I didn't do anything.
[01:37.21]I lied.
[01:38.57]You see what I'm saying?
[01:40.13]You understand now?
[01:41.27]I didn't do anything.
[01:43.75]It's the exact same mic, the exact same setup.
[01:46.16]Nothing fucking changed.
[01:47.70]Not one thing changed.
[01:52.42]It's the exact same microphone.
[01:57.50]Dude, you know, like, 2020 hindsight, but here's the thing.
[02:01.44]I need to... I might just do it, and I don't even care.
[02:05.25]Like, the few thousand of you that are here right now, just quiet about it.
[02:08.97]If I had, like, an audio tech guy come on stream and do a bunch of shit...
[02:13.21]And he'll put up a bunch of shit on the stream.
[02:16.64]I'll capture it on OBS.
[02:18.10]And moving knobs left and right.
[02:21.16]Having a big pair of headphones on.
[02:23.42]Raising the, you know, on the equalizer.
[02:25.46]Mm-hmm.
[02:25.88]Yep, that's better.
[02:26.48]Keep talking.
[02:27.06]Keep talking.
[02:28.44]And I don't change fucking any settings.
[02:32.56]And like the next day, people are just going to think that it's better when he didn't do anything.
[02:36.88]It was an actor.
[02:38.52]I should have just done that.
[02:48.84]But yes, no, we have a lot to talk about.
[02:51.56]Oh boy, do we have a lot to talk about.
[02:53.36]Okay, so here, let's start with the bad news.
[02:56.28]The bad news is, today was going to be Green Screen Movie Night Part 2, but it's not.
[03:03.47]There's nothing wrong with the playlist.
[03:05.33]Everything's done.
[03:06.31]It's ready to go.
[03:07.09]It's been ready for the last few days, from my understanding.
[03:11.73]the problem was I got up today and a problem I've been having recently you guys know that the last week or two has been kind of a pain in the ass covid kind of came through the house and I didn't get it but maybe I did I don't know
[03:29.24]And ever since, I've been getting these digestive problems and these fucking headaches.
[03:34.93]And I woke up today, and I had one of these annoying headaches.
[03:39.05]And if I were to laugh really, really hard, like we did last week or whatever week before, I would have to turn the stream off in like 40 minutes.
[03:54.28]So, I've got kind of an issue in my brain today and I knew for a fact that it would be a bad idea.
[04:02.13]So, if I were to watch two or three of those videos and they were really funny, I might, like, have to just leave and turn it off.
[04:12.18]But,
[04:13.28]Here's the good news.
[04:15.00]It's not like, oh, it's over.
[04:16.94]You're never going to see it.
[04:18.20]No, it's just whenever in the next probably few days or in the next, you know, maybe next weekend or something.
[04:23.28]Because let me tell you something.
[04:27.60]Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[04:30.18]We have this stream every single day next week, pretty much.
[04:35.73]Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday.
[04:38.58]So it's a packed week.
[04:40.71]And the reason why I'm doing that is not just because there's a lot of fun stuff to do with, you know, friends and streamers and stuff.
[04:47.33]It's the baseball show is the 19th of this month.
[04:52.75]So I want to get a lot of streams.
[04:55.70]So because I'm obviously not you're not going to see me for a little while after after next weekend.
[05:03.70]You are going to not see me till baseball.
[05:12.64]You don't want to laugh, but you're going to play the sim casino game.
[05:16.32]Well, here's the difference, right?
[05:20.08]There's laughing at like somebody, you know, puking on the floor in the casino game, whatever.
[05:24.58]And then there is, I don't, I can't stop laughing or I can't stop having a major reaction to like three to five straight minutes of video.
[05:35.09]And like, do you remember last time?
[05:36.87]I was dying last time.
[05:42.85]So I think it's going to be a little different.
[05:48.42]It killed me too, yeah.
[05:50.08]And I'll be honest too, I'd rather be in a better state on like an important, special, fun night like that.
[05:57.61]I don't want to just be kind of like...
[05:59.71]Oh yeah, I feel like shit.
[06:01.35]Uh, let's do that thing that, you know, I've been looking forward to for, you know, months.
[06:06.39]No, no, fuck that.
[06:07.99]You know what I mean?
[06:08.85]And I know, I know it's disappointing, but I think it'd be more fun that way.
[06:12.99]I don't want to just, I'd rather be able to enjoy it.
[06:14.87]Right.
[06:20.50]So here's the plan.
[06:21.44]We're going to do this today.
[06:22.24]We're going to play Sim Casino.
[06:24.66]I'm not going to laugh, but I probably am.
[06:28.17]I will explain the tweet, by the way.
[06:30.11]A lot of people are confused by my last tweet.
[06:32.05]You know, one tweet a year, Andy.
[06:35.33]I will explain that because there's a lot of people saying, what is he even talking about?
[06:37.97]Who's he even talking to?
[06:39.03]Why is he saying this?
[06:41.76]Okay, let's explain that real quick.
[06:44.46]If you have an iPhone and you open up an app called Pages, you can do it right now, literally while you're sitting and listening to this.
[06:50.93]open up pages and go to, you know, new, like I'm going to make a new document, click on templates, choose template, and then new note.
[07:04.10]And it's just a fucking spell.
[07:06.04]It's like, it's just Latin.
[07:08.94]So what I had to have done is I have a ton of notes, right?
[07:11.94]Because anytime I think of like a stream idea or something I need to write down, something I want to remember talking about, boom, I open up like notes and let's go.
[07:18.84]Alright.
[07:19.26]Uh, it's going to be a stream where I, uh, I sit on my head and drink a glass of milk, right?
[07:23.83]Whatever.
[07:24.11]That's not, no, you know what I mean?
[07:27.12]So I must have opened it and didn't do anything.
[07:32.90]And then just went, oh, I'll get to this later.
[07:34.82]And then a year plus later, I'm cleaning out these and I didn't remember that's what that did.
[07:41.00]I had no idea that's what that did.
[07:45.56]You know, I didn't remember that it fills in placeholder Latin.
[07:51.20]So I'm sitting here freaking out thinking, why is this here?
[07:57.46]Why is this here?
[07:58.48]Because think about that.
[07:59.66]If you don't remember that, if you have no idea why that's there, that somebody wrote Latin in your phone.
[08:06.74]Who?
[08:07.90]I didn't fucking do it.
[08:09.00]You think I don't know Latin?
[08:09.98]I was going line by line and I was translating it.
[08:14.34]And it was just gibberish.
[08:16.00]I was like, what was I trying to even tell myself?
[08:20.40]Like, what am I doing?
[08:21.72]Did I do this like as a joke?
[08:23.81]Like I was showing somebody like, Hey, look, look at my like notes for a stream.
[08:26.99]I'm thinking of it's in Latin, but no.
[08:29.57]Yeah, it was lorem ipsum.
[08:35.37]And it's just the default placeholder for a note take and you just delete it and do your own.
[08:42.17]But it was scary.
[08:43.13]I was actually kind of scared for at least 15 to 20 minutes.
[08:50.25]Yeah, it's just placeholder.
[08:51.39]I know.
[08:51.90]But I was putting it into a Latin to English translator and I was getting English words.
[08:58.50]I was getting English sentences.
[09:01.51]One of them was like, oh, removal of the makeup or something.
[09:04.33]And I'm like, removal of the makeup.
[09:06.89]What does that mean?
[09:09.15]What do I mean removal of makeup?
[09:11.09]What does that mean?
[09:20.80]And I had to forget about it.
[09:21.74]I had to.
[09:24.47]When are you going to do the welding stream?
[09:26.33]Never.
[09:26.61]What are you talking about?
[09:29.33]Alright, you guys ready?
[09:38.41]You guys good to go?
[09:40.21]Latin stream incoming.
[09:41.71]And there's something about Latin, right?
[09:43.63]That's all I'm thinking of.
[09:45.25]Hold on.
[09:46.53]All I'm thinking of
[09:48.54]is every movie I've ever seen where, you know, the priest is sitting there like, and I'm just like, oh my God, I don't know why.
[09:58.42]Latin is a scary, like demon language in all these fucking movies.
[10:03.11]So I'm sitting there going like, what is this?
[10:06.85]The only time they use Latin ever in the last like 20 to 30 to 50 plus years is to make it a scary moment in a horror movie.
[10:16.45]That's not, it's nowhere else.
[10:21.73]Oh, he's speaking Latin.
[10:22.99]Oh, shit.
[10:23.77]The movie just got way scarier, right?
[10:26.21]So I'm sitting there thinking, like, what the hell?
[10:28.39]Why is this on here?
[10:36.46]Dear, you might be the Antichrist.
[10:39.50]No, I don't think so.
[10:41.16]I think I would have figured that out a long time ago.
[10:49.76]I don't think Satan makes the Antichrist baby and then waits till 37 to like, oh, okay, time to, it's the Antichrist.
[10:57.77]There he is.
[10:59.55]37-year-old fucking comedy dork streamer, Jerma985.
[11:03.36]You guys are fucking nuts if you think that.
[11:05.04]I'm just going to be honest with you.
[11:05.90]You're crazy.
[11:10.70]I don't believe that's accurate.
[11:20.15]Alright, let's get, what'd he say?
[11:21.05]Sim Casino.
[11:22.61]Let's do it.
[11:27.79]This has got music too.
[11:28.62]Alright, what'd he say?
[11:31.26]I mean, I don't really feel that great.
[11:32.40]Maybe no facecam for a little while.
[11:36.19]But I do need to, like, learn how to play.
[11:38.87]Now, this is Sim- This is not Casino Inc.
[11:42.07]This is Sim Casino.
[11:43.06]This is a different game.
[11:45.28]What I have confirmed, and I know people saying, oh my god, remember Casino Inc., where you could, like, there was, like, a bunch of crazy shit in that game.
[11:53.22]I can confirm that I think that people do beat each other up in this game.
[11:56.86]That's all.
[11:57.62]I didn't look too much into it, but I know that that's a possibility.
[12:01.16]So, okay, everybody calm down.
[12:06.08]I kind of want to make a hotel.
[12:11.48]This game's fairly new as well.
[12:12.64]I think it was an early access or something.
[12:21.52]It's got a saxophone.
[12:22.46]Alright, let me learn how to play.
[12:25.29]I'll turn the facecam on in just a minute.
[12:35.77]wow damn that that you can always tell when the person that's playing the saxophone knows what they're doing when they do one of those they do one of those it's like that you know what I'm talking about did I break it 60. I think it broke did I break it
[13:06.02]I think I broke it.
[13:08.34]This doesn't seem like it's functioning.
[13:16.77]I'll give it five more seconds.
[13:25.18]It's crazy because when I do that sound, it sucks and everybody hates it.
[13:30.64]But when the saxophone does that sound, everybody loves it, right?
[13:37.75]if I do that sound everyone's gonna leave alright let me I gotta reload the game I think I want to make a casino alright here's like it's messed up I messed it up somehow try again
[14:06.39]Dude, quit, stop being the Antichrist.
[14:09.32]Would that be, like, public knowledge?
[14:10.86]Could I even still stream?
[14:14.48]Would it be, you know what I mean?
[14:15.78]Like, dude, like, of course, like, Antichrist Andy, like, fucked up the game again.
[14:19.24]Would that be, like, public knowledge?
[14:30.65]Antichrist.
[14:32.11]Oh, please.
[14:33.71]Okay, can I, maybe, Tutorials.
[14:38.44]Maybe because I tried to continue the tutorial, it screwed up?
[14:40.58]Uh-oh.
[14:41.00]Okay, here we go.
[14:41.52]No?
[14:41.82]What?
[14:43.06]Oh, no.
[14:43.34]Okay, here we go.
[14:44.02]Alright, let's go.
[14:45.46]This is SimCasino.
[14:48.71]Alright.
[14:51.73]Welcome to SimCasino.
[14:52.67]Select a tutorial.
[14:53.33]Alright, how to control the camera.
[14:55.73]This music.
[14:59.19]Okay, let's see.
[15:07.05]They just take bags of money outside?
[15:08.41]Okay, let's get a good view of the casino.
[15:11.33]Remember that you can change the keyboard shortcuts in the settings screen.
[15:13.93]Hover over an objective for additional info.
[15:16.81]Okay, yeah, that's move, tilt, zoom.
[15:21.74]Yeah, easy.
[15:24.08]Easy, continue.
[15:24.88]Alright, uh, zoom the camera.
[15:27.90]Move the camera up and down a level.
[15:29.37]Okay.
[15:31.99]Right bracket, page up.
[15:33.55]Left bracket, page down.
[15:36.31]Left bracket, page up.
[15:37.77]Left bracket, page down.
[15:39.27]Left bracket, page up.
[15:40.41]Left bracket, page down.
[15:41.79]Left bracket, page up.
[15:43.25]Left bracket.
[15:44.25]I just got fucking flashbacks to being inventive.
[15:47.97]You motherfuckers that used to do that.
[15:52.08]Um, okay, move the camera up and down.
[15:59.17]Right bracket, page up.
[16:01.17]Page up.
[16:02.93]Right bracket.
[16:04.95]I can't take it.
[16:07.89]Oh, alright.
[16:08.31]That's easy.
[16:08.97]So this is how you go up and down.
[16:11.12]Is that the only way to do it?
[16:11.80]Cool.
[16:12.90]Alright.
[16:17.60]Or click on the arrows on the far left of the screen.
[16:20.22]Actually, I like that better.
[16:26.22]Alright.
[16:27.02]Tutorial seems like it's pretty quick.
[16:29.33]We should expand our structure's foundations, which creates a base for us to build in.
[16:33.41]Hover over the objective for additional help.
[16:35.27]It's like the wall tool.
[16:36.31]Okay, look at the left toolbar.
[16:41.44]Hover over the buttons.
[16:43.62]Find it in the build menu at the bottom of the screen.
[16:46.36]Alright, so we need to make a wall tool.
[16:49.93]This is quite how they go, balls.
[16:52.35]Okay.
[16:53.19]Add at least a hundred 10x10 new ground floor cells.
[16:59.10]Alright, doesn't matter where.
[16:59.74]Put it right there.
[17:18.58]It looks kind of awful.
[17:21.03]What did I do wrong?
[17:21.95]My mic just cut it off.
[17:31.23]Mike, stop cutting it off.
[17:32.40]I'm trying to do it.
[17:38.50]Drag to make rooms.
[17:41.22]Oh, I'm doing it like The Sims.
[17:44.18]Okay, that's fine.
[17:46.17]Okay, cool.
[17:46.59]So you can make rooms like this.
[17:50.07]Okay, pretty sweet.
[17:53.53]There are two ways to ensure each area is accessible.
[17:56.34]Removing an interior wall or adding a door, staff door or private door.
[18:01.06]Staff doors are used to secure areas away from the guests while private doors are used for dressing rooms and hotel rooms to separate from the other guests.
[18:09.21]Make sure all ground level areas are accessible.
[18:12.55]Okay, so we can just how do we remove
[18:18.31]Google bar or build map?
[18:19.31]Oh, we can go like this.
[18:22.61]Like this?
[18:29.14]Control Z?
[18:32.74]Yeah, this is like a terrible hallway.
[18:40.15]Well, I didn't know that was... How do I delete this?
[18:59.76]Cigarette Andy.
[19:00.48]Stop calling me that.
[19:06.03]Oh, fuck.
[19:06.77]This is a tutorial.
[19:07.55]Who cares?
[19:07.99]Okay, so how do I make a door?
[19:10.19]Fence.
[19:12.92]The zone.
[19:14.22]Dismantle walls and fences.
[19:15.82]Here we go.
[19:16.26]Okay.
[19:17.20]Push tab.
[19:30.79]Remove an interior wall, toolbar, or buildment.
[19:32.99]Drag a line across the area to remove it, but it must be all indoors.
[19:36.33]Oh.
[19:39.83]Like this?
[19:47.29]What the fuck?
[19:50.04]Doesn't it say I can just remove a wall here?
[19:51.84]Stop Cigarette Andy.
[19:58.34]I'll just add a door, I guess, then.
[20:03.61]Dismantle wall, de-zone fence wall tool.
[20:08.03]Operations?
[20:08.61]I don't understand.
[20:13.77]Should I build a fucking fence?
[20:19.13]I'm not crazy, right?
[20:19.85]This is really confusing.
[20:21.39]I don't get it.
[20:25.87]Build menu.
[20:31.77]Where's the build menu?
[20:34.25]This is the build menu here, right?
[20:42.78]He's too high for this.
[20:45.84]Once I figure this out, we're golden, but what the?
[20:48.77]B?
[20:49.45]Well, I don't know.
[20:50.39]It didn't say B. How do I know it's B?
[20:52.13]How am I supposed to know it's B?
[20:53.47]Okay.
[20:56.49]Okay.
[21:05.72]Indoor only.
[21:06.42]Oh my god.
[21:11.66]If I wasn't just a fucking idiot and didn't build these in the middle of nowhere.
[21:18.79]Indoor only?
[21:19.71]Okay, we're just gonna delete this because it's honest to god.
[21:32.64]Uh, what's the delete tool?
[21:33.56]Demolish structures.
[21:34.48]Just get rid of this.
[21:38.96]This needs to be connected to here.
[21:43.76]Can't be a door leading outside.
[21:45.04]I have to make a hallway.
[21:47.94]OK, so let's make a wall.
[21:52.42]Does that work?
[21:55.34]This cannot be reached from the bus stop.
[21:56.86]What do I care?
[21:57.68]There we go.
[22:03.18]Does this count as a room?
[22:04.18]Is this mad that this is not accessible?
[22:16.01]What's wrong now?
[22:31.82]Oh, it needs to be a door.
[22:33.26]It's mad that it's not a door.
[22:45.17]What do you want from me?
[22:45.83]Why does this count as a room?
[22:59.74]Alright, I get it.
[23:05.66]This doesn't even count as a room!
[23:11.51]Alright, what happened here is the same company got hired.
[23:15.71]No, no, no.
[23:16.07]Two different companies got hired to do the same job.
[23:19.37]And we didn't cancel on one of them.
[23:21.94]And they just malicious compliance came and just installed their doors.
[23:27.12]And we didn't stop them.
[23:29.46]Okay, cool.
[23:29.70]Okay, so this is the garbage zone.
[23:31.80]Oh, okay.
[23:31.96]So this is deliverables.
[23:32.90]Deliveries.
[23:33.20]Garbage.
[23:58.91]Storage, cash vault.
[24:00.41]Oh, we got a cash.
[24:01.41]Why would the cash vault be right here?
[24:03.41]It's just got to be on the ground, man.
[24:04.95]It's got to be on the ground.
[24:08.29]Okay, that's cool.
[24:10.78]This is to introduce to a restroom.
[24:12.48]Okay.
[24:14.20]That's, alright, that's cool.
[24:15.32]Okay, how many zones can I make?
[24:17.36]An unlimited amount?
[24:18.24]Could I have like a thousand cash rooms?
[24:25.37]Could I have, okay, my plan is to have like 20 cash rooms and I only have one of them have money in them.
[24:30.83]You want to come rob my casino?
[24:32.07]Fuckface.
[24:34.15]You better get the right one, because it's going to be a maze for you.
[24:40.31]This music is nice.
[24:41.13]Yeah, it is.
[24:41.41]Alright, hold on, let me see.
[24:45.71]Because this is to create... Wait, what is it?
[24:48.98]It was here somewhere.
[24:52.83]Wasn't it like, oh, D zone.
[24:54.41]Okay.
[24:54.57]Alright, cool.
[24:56.43]Let's add a bingo hall.
[24:57.81]Well, you know it.
[25:00.43]Create a bingo hall.
[25:01.03]Find entertainment in the build menu or search for bingo.
[25:05.68]Drag an area inside the building that meets the minimum required size.
[25:08.80]Press shift to quickly fill the whole room.
[25:10.96]Let's go bingo.
[25:13.94]Bingo.
[25:25.11]Wait, hold on.
[25:28.73]Oh, bingo hall zone.
[25:29.95]You got it.
[25:33.69]Cool.
[25:36.87]Check which objects you need by hovering over the zone.
[25:41.20]Ah, alright.
[25:41.70]This is cool.
[25:42.86]Alright, we need a bingo podium.
[25:45.30]Man.
[25:46.82]Man, can you imagine?
[25:50.70]Never mind.
[25:52.16]Shh.
[25:53.82]Quiet.
[25:54.54]Hey, everybody be quiet.
[25:58.92]Hey.
[25:59.80]Quiet.
[26:01.74]Hey, can you imagine if, you know... Quiet.
[26:07.14]Okay.
[26:07.38]I gotta be careful here.
[26:13.01]I gotta be careful here.
[26:14.53]I'm treading on water I shouldn't be.
[26:17.24]Alright, where are we going?
[26:18.38]I need a bingo podium.
[26:19.98]I guess I can just type, right?
[26:23.99]Bingo.
[26:28.61]Bingo podium.
[26:30.33]$2,000?
[26:36.00]How do you rotate?
[26:36.66]Oh, there we are.
[26:41.54]Cool.
[26:43.10]And then I need bingo seating.
[26:43.86]Bingo seating.
[26:53.46]Waiting for a delivery of payout receipt by a workman.
[26:56.96]Check you have enough stock assigned.
[26:58.50]Wait, what is this?
[27:00.05]I can't even understand what this is trying to tell me.
[27:06.09]Oh.
[27:08.59]What are they doing here?
[27:15.75]They didn't even do anything.
[27:22.53]Moving crate, what did they do?
[27:24.31]They didn't do anything.
[27:25.13]Okay, what else needs to be here?
[27:30.64]Bingo card counter, oh.
[27:41.69]Cool, alright, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[27:45.93]Delicious compliance workers.
[27:48.76]Alright, I got it.
[27:49.56]That's fun.
[27:50.70]You can customize the designs and colors of walls with the paint tool.
[27:54.43]Hold down control.
[27:55.15]Damn, this soundtrack actually goes fucking hard.
[27:58.41]Okay, with the paint tool, hold down control.
[28:04.15]Alright, so let's do some painting.
[28:11.29]Where's the paint tool?
[28:12.13]The paint tool.
[28:17.62]You guys see a paint tool?
[28:20.36]Somebody else tell me where this... Oh, there it is.
[28:21.61]Okay.
[28:22.93]Uh, alright.
[28:23.59]Oh, alright.
[28:24.45]I'm into this.
[28:25.41]I'm into this a lot.
[28:26.93]That's fine.
[28:30.05]Cool.
[28:30.67]Can I do... What about the, uh... Can I do the carpet?
[28:33.31]I have to be able to do the carpets, right?
[28:38.30]Look at the floors, too.
[28:40.66]Oh, to do matching floor?
[28:42.04]Hold control to select the matching floor.
[28:51.23]Matching floor.
[28:51.91]How do I do that?
[28:54.41]Is there already people playing bingo?
[28:55.31]How much does this cost?
[28:57.41]Okay, uh, I want bricks on the ground.
[29:09.65]How do I do that?
[29:13.37]Hold shift?
[29:14.28]Hold control.
[29:15.42]I don't get it.
[29:19.16]Hold control.
[29:21.63]Oh, come on, Gwen.
[29:23.59]I half-assed that one so bad.
[29:25.59]Oh, come on, Gwen.
[29:29.91]Like, do I even care anymore?
[29:32.13]Okay, there we go.
[29:34.78]Right, like, I love that phrase, but I really didn't give it any effort at all.
[29:39.26]Okay.
[29:43.38]Move a single object.
[29:44.32]Yep, yep, yep.
[29:47.95]Move a single object or drag multi-selected and move multiple objects.
[29:54.38]Oh shit, okay.
[29:57.46]Move.
[29:59.64]Oh, that's actually pretty, that's useful.
[30:02.72]That's useful.
[30:04.99]Copy an object with the eyedropper.
[30:09.05]Sick.
[30:09.87]Yep.
[30:11.59]Clone an area with the clone tool.
[30:15.18]And you can clone the whole thing.
[30:19.30]Whoa.
[30:20.00]Alright.
[30:23.52]That's very helpful.
[30:27.28]Finally, you can click copy on any designer tool and click paste on another object designer tool.
[30:32.90]You can also copy certain settings and use multi-select to select many objects.
[30:38.21]Stop doing that.
[30:38.75]I'm going to give myself another headache.
[30:40.19]And paste the settings multi-select.
[30:42.23]I don't think I need to do that.
[30:43.11]My brain's too small for that.
[30:43.95]I don't care.
[30:47.98]Alright.
[30:48.92]A successful casino.
[30:51.48]Do we know?
[30:51.86]I think we pretty much know what we're doing.
[30:54.90]I'm gonna go through this pretty quickly.
[30:57.00]Wait.
[30:57.48]Delete.
[31:00.69]Ooh!
[31:16.85]it's a dollar to play it okay jackpot chance is five percent jackpot is ten dollars what a terrible jackpot this needs to be like a million house advantage um I don't know five okay hover okay slot machines are fundamental okay click on slot machine and switch to game settings tab yeah
[31:49.01]Okay, cool.
[31:51.19]Gamblers have a confidence score.
[31:52.67]New gamblers generally enter with a low confidence score, and this is increased when they win or push in games.
[31:58.05]The higher the play cost, the more confidence they need to try it.
[32:02.04]To avoid alienating new players, it's good to have a variety of play costs.
[32:06.44]Increase the play cost to $1.
[32:07.76]Note the confidence value.
[32:11.90]Okay, 0 to 2.4.
[32:13.64]So what if I made this like 10 bucks?
[32:19.53]Okay.
[32:24.08]This OST is Jerry Martin.
[32:25.90]It's the original composer of Sims 1.
[32:27.44]Is that legitimate?
[32:28.34]Are you for real?
[32:28.84]Because that's pretty fucking cool if you're accurate.
[32:32.00]Alright, the house advantage has got to be more than that, but whatever.
[32:36.20]We're just doing the tutorial.
[32:40.73]Okay.
[32:40.83]Copy these settings to at least four other slots.
[32:41.91]How do I do that?
[32:42.29]Copy game settings to...
[33:10.05]Bingo.
[33:11.23]Copy.
[33:12.93]What?
[33:14.11]How do I do that?
[33:17.25]Oh, got it.
[33:17.79]Pace game settings.
[33:18.45]What the hell?
[33:26.51]What the hell?
[33:35.01]What the hell?
[33:42.35]Copy game settings.
[33:46.03]How do I paste?
[33:51.34]Paste game settings, right?
[33:58.32]What the hell?
[34:07.51]Control C, Control V. Control C. No, that's not how you do it.
[34:12.59]I mean, I'm very clearly doing it.
[34:13.77]10 bucks.
[34:19.99]Jackpot, 1,000.
[34:20.99]House advantage, 10%, right?
[34:25.21]Like, okay, copy settings and paste it to everything.
[34:29.34]That had to have done it.
[34:37.52]He's never used a keyboard.
[34:46.47]$100.
[34:46.49]Player cost, $1.
[34:49.87]Oh, okay.
[34:52.89]Whatever.
[34:53.25]It had to be the exact thing.
[34:56.05]I get it, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[34:59.21]Bill with payout receipt by a workman and when a gambler wins, the machine will print out a payout receipt.
[35:04.11]Gambler will take this to the ATM to collect their cash as long as they don't forget.
[35:06.75]Slot machines have electricity costs and require a higher confidence to play for low play cost amounts at first.
[35:13.34]You can research high limit gambling and higher advantages.
[35:15.64]Alright.
[35:17.72]Table games have higher betting amounts.
[35:19.62]I know what a casino is.
[35:21.38]Alright.
[35:21.76]Let's build a cashier.
[35:33.54]Cashier cage.
[35:34.22]Okay.
[35:38.57]Build a table game.
[35:42.15]A gambling tab.
[35:44.49]Okay.
[35:46.91]How about, uh... Texas Hold'em!
[35:51.69]I don't know how to play this.
[35:52.66]I don't like playing this.
[35:59.12]Zone and build a pit boss office.
[36:03.27]Okay.
[36:15.63]Uh, pit boss office.
[36:17.80]Okay.
[36:23.72]Failed.
[36:24.10]Oh, okay.
[36:25.26]Hold on.
[36:26.90]We need a door.
[36:35.23]Okay.
[36:37.09]Need a computer desk.
[36:38.61]Requires to be protected behind a staff door.
[36:40.77]Oh, whatever.
[36:46.28]Now we need a computer desk.
[36:50.42]Listen to this sound!
[36:55.36]Okay, cool.
[36:57.80]This is crazy!
[37:04.93]A player's club desk will allow you to track info about your gamblers if they sign up.
[37:08.69]Encourage them to sign up with a complimentary gift.
[37:11.68]Once signed up, they can come back as repeat customers and retain their confidence level for next time.
[37:15.30]Nice.
[37:16.72]Alright.
[37:17.66]Managing staff and crime.
[37:20.56]Your staff handled the other... Alright, this music's too good for me to talk.
[37:33.29]Okay.
[37:34.66]You're st- Jesus!
[37:40.90]Are you done?
[37:48.46]Have you finished?
[37:49.00]Okay.
[37:51.76]We need to clap, I think.
[37:52.66]I feel like everyone needs to clap.
[37:54.08]Because we've got to kind of get back to what we were doing.
[37:56.59]Your staff handle the operations of your casino.
[37:59.11]They work at desks, serve drinks, watch for criminals, and drain your bank balance with their wages.
[38:04.21]That's an odd way to word that last sentence.
[38:07.82]Okay.
[38:09.02]There are a lot more... If there are... If there are...
[38:15.08]I'm just, I'm thinking the solo's gonna come back and it's freaking me out.
[38:18.24]There are a lot more tasks than staff a warning will show.
[38:21.31]You should schedule more if the warning stays on for a long time.
[38:25.23]Note that staff are automatically hired when scheduled.
[38:27.67]There's no need to hire or fire staff.
[38:29.23]You'll always have the right amount for your schedules.
[38:30.95]Okay.
[38:31.73]That's kind of helpful.
[38:35.30]Alright, let's do it.
[38:36.14]Let's take a look at the staff management screen.
[38:38.86]On the right of it, we'll see how many are busy or idle or on patrol.
[38:43.14]As our casino gets bigger, we will likely need more janitors.
[38:48.67]Add a garbage on it.
[38:49.71]Fuck!
[38:50.73]That was so bad.
[38:56.81]I was trying to do, like, to the music.
[38:59.82]It...
[39:03.34]You know what?
[39:03.80]I could have done it, but when stuff doesn't rhyme, it feels weird to sing it.
[39:07.77]You know what I'm saying?
[39:12.69]If something rhymes, it's like a song, the last word usually rhymes, but I can't do it right here.
[39:20.79]Do it again?
[39:21.27]I'll try it again.
[39:24.52]But it has to be in like a poem format.
[39:31.26]Okay.
[39:32.44]Oh, this is embarrassing.
[39:34.14]And you're making me do this because it's embarrassing.
[39:38.02]Okay.
[39:38.30]Press unassigned key or find the button on the bottom menu bar.
[39:42.69]Staff operations menu.
[39:48.31]Okay.
[39:52.59]The staff type is automatically hard.
[39:54.15]Click on their placed objects or zones to edit.
[39:56.57]Okay.
[39:56.93]Garbage.
[40:00.24]Scheduled hours.
[40:02.76]Alright.
[40:03.00]So we have from 8 a.m.
[40:04.36]to 8 p.m.
[40:04.78]There are two.
[40:05.36]There are two janitors.
[40:09.24]Add schedule.
[40:09.76]Alright.
[40:13.20]Alright.
[40:13.46]This is great.
[40:13.94]I get it.
[40:16.50]What about the housekeeping schedule screen?
[40:25.79]Housekeeping.
[40:27.67]Where's that?
[40:33.21]Oh, okay.
[40:33.87]This is it right there.
[40:34.86]Alright, cool.
[40:37.82]Look at when the janitors will arrive during the weekend and the weekends.
[40:40.62]By default, weekdays and weekends use the same schedule.
[40:43.18]Does it help?
[40:44.74]Here's number three.
[40:45.54]Okay.
[40:48.16]Easy.
[40:49.77]You do not need to hire these new janitors.
[40:51.61]They are hired automatically when you schedule extra workmen, guards, and chefs.
[40:55.87]There's chefs in the game, by the way.
[40:56.93]Everybody relax.
[40:57.85]Okay.
[40:59.77]Okay.
[41:01.44]Setting up your staffed objects like cashier cages, bars, and desks is simpler.
[41:05.20]Uh, schedule editor is basically the same, but you toggle the open close hours that are the number of staff.
[41:11.65]They're also hired automatically.
[41:12.89]Okay.
[41:14.17]I'll figure this out later.
[41:16.13]You can set patrols up.
[41:18.03]Okay.
[41:18.25]I'll figure that out later.
[41:20.43]Alright.
[41:20.79]I'll figure this out later.
[41:23.98]I'll figure this out later.
[41:24.64]Alright.
[41:25.88]We can do area patrols for the security guard.
[41:31.85]Probably the front door, right?
[41:39.22]This makes sense, doesn't it?
[41:40.12]That makes sense, right?
[41:47.19]Okay, that's good.
[41:48.69]That's good.
[41:51.36]That looks good.
[41:52.32]That looks good.
[41:57.44]Oh, it's like drink servers.
[42:00.10]Oh, okay, so we can make them go like this, right?
[42:03.52]Because I think they're going to start here at the bar.
[42:04.94]And they're going to go, yoink.
[42:08.69]And then they go like this.
[42:11.99]Just going to walk around.
[42:13.55]This thing.
[42:15.77]With at least four points.
[42:16.73]Oh, come on.
[42:22.19]And then back over, I don't know, over here to this table.
[42:24.13]Yeah.
[42:24.27]Alright, looks good.
[42:41.89]What do you mean?
[42:45.51]Hunger, thirsty, bored.
[42:49.49]Wait, I am this person now?
[42:57.30]You can run?
[42:58.36]Alright, this is inverted mouse controls, by the way.
[43:13.23]that's kind of funny okay okay uh pit boss can be set on patrol to calm the frustrated players the slot machines and table games they also look out for hackers and cheaters near them security guards are a lot different they look up for thieves hackers and cheaters and can chase them too you'll want them spread around your casino so they will be standing in ideal locations to capture criminals
[43:41.05]We can look at the recent crimes and the local crime rate.
[43:44.27]Suburbs tend to have much less crimes in the big city.
[43:46.37]Oh, open the crimes overview screen.
[43:52.50]What are all these people doing out here?
[43:53.66]Alright, the crimes overview.
[44:01.70]Woody Lane neighborhood crime, 5%.
[44:03.14]How many guards should chase down a single criminal?
[44:09.53]Eight?
[44:10.09]No.
[44:17.68]The three main crime types are slot machine hackers, stock thieves, and table game cheaters.
[44:27.03]Thieves can hack your staff doors to access restricted places.
[44:30.55]Cheaters take longer to detect and may win multiple times before getting noticed.
[44:35.23]There's a good chance they will fail to cheat and end up losing more money than they started with.
[44:38.83]These failed attempts do not show up in the crime report.
[44:43.41]Research security cameras.
[44:44.65]Detect criminals.
[44:46.49]Okay.
[44:48.10]Alright.
[44:48.48]Alright.
[44:49.52]We are almost done.
[44:56.14]We're almost done.
[44:56.80]Free the lady.
[44:59.30]What do you... I don't have... It's a tutorial.
[45:01.06]I don't know what I just did.
[45:17.43]These are your recent thoughts.
[45:20.23]I lost at the slot machine.
[45:21.43]There were no nearby bin.
[45:25.05]Not the fact that you've been trapped in the bathroom for like 12 hours.
[45:28.69]Oh, I know she said the bar.
[45:38.30]Can I play a machine?
[45:39.34]Okay.
[45:50.00]Open the... what was it?
[45:52.63]Manually delivery is enabled.
[45:54.03]This means we need to set how much stock to order.
[45:56.53]On the left is a graph showing current zone capacities.
[46:00.07]And in the middle is all the stock types.
[46:03.86]Huh?
[46:04.00]At the bottom of the screen, click on the truck.
[46:11.70]Bedsheets, beer, betting tickets, table game chips, and soda.
[46:20.12]Okay.
[46:23.00]Set the target of payout receipts to at least six.
[46:27.82]Payout receipts.
[46:29.96]To six.
[46:32.83]Okay.
[46:37.04]Let's say you have two crates of payout receipts in storage and a target of six.
[46:41.10]In the next delivery, you would expect to see four additional crates.
[46:44.89]If you ever have too much of something because of a higher target than the number of crates, the excess will stay in your inventory.
[46:50.27]You can click on crates to sell them.
[46:52.91]Okay.
[46:58.09]How long has he been streaming for?
[46:59.05]I don't know, like 40 minutes?
[47:00.47]I'm just chilling today.
[47:02.27]Yeah, alright, so now that there's enough people here, let me go over this one more time.
[47:05.79]Green screen got moved to a different day because I didn't really feel that well.
[47:11.07]And I don't want to make my headache worse by laughing every 15 seconds as hard as I can.
[47:18.28]Especially considering that there's a lot of shit going on this coming week.
[47:21.16]And then baseball, so...
[47:23.16]Don't worry, we're still doing it.
[47:24.60]We're still doing it.
[47:25.22]I'm just moving it to like another, I don't know, maybe three or four days, maybe next weekend.
[47:31.46]I'll figure it out.
[47:32.74]Don't worry.
[47:34.19]We are going to do it.
[47:34.95]Trust me.
[47:35.83]I've been looking forward to it for a long time.
[47:37.25]I'm not going to just skip it.
[47:38.81]Okay, but anyways.
[47:41.43]Alright, transport tab.
[47:43.55]Supply truck comes.
[47:45.89]Alright, so you can determine how often this shit comes.
[47:48.65]Alright, I get it.
[47:50.66]Most important stock is cash.
[47:53.32]ATMs and cashier cages get filled regularly because they need to hand out cash when gamblers win.
[47:58.70]What if I don't have any cash?
[48:02.78]Don't worry, guys.
[48:03.24]He'll watch more videos and play Yakuza 0 and finish Red Dead 2.
[48:06.10]But you can't take something from like four and a half years ago and say, hey, man, remember when you didn't finish Red Dead 2 five years ago or whatever it was?
[48:19.18]No, you, this is how it works.
[48:21.65]You get to have a trailing six months of things to be upset about me with, right?
[48:26.99]It's a trailing six months.
[48:28.59]If it's been a year, I mean, come on.
[48:32.57]I didn't play Yakuza 0.
[48:33.87]It's been a year.
[48:34.65]It's been like two years.
[48:35.93]You can't, it's trailing six months.
[48:39.91]Where's Paper Mario?
[48:40.97]Alright, so that one I understand.
[48:43.31]I understand that one because I said, you know, within, remember the trailing six months?
[48:48.81]I would play it.
[48:54.48]What about Sly Cooper?
[48:56.69]I don't want to play Sly Cooper.
[49:00.95]Here's why I don't want to play Sly Cooper.
[49:02.39]I'm going to open the game, and I'm going to do the first two levels and go, I don't really care.
[49:07.08]And I'm going to sit there and go, I remember this game was really fun.
[49:10.54]This is like a really cool game back in like the fucking 70s when it came out.
[49:14.68]And it's cool, but I'm going to get through the first three levels and go, alright, that was some nostalgia.
[49:19.08]That was fun.
[49:19.48]Remember when I played Ratatouille?
[49:22.72]Everyone was so excited for it, and I played for three hours, and I said, why?
[49:25.32]This is okay.
[49:26.24]That was fun.
[49:31.54]Fly Cooper is a great game.
[49:33.58]It is.
[49:33.82]I remember playing it when I was younger.
[49:35.16]I would probably, on stream, I'd probably be like, alright, let's go.
[49:40.06]And then I would get like through like an hour and a half in and be like, ah, shit, I got to shit.
[49:44.88]I've got to take a shit.
[49:45.68]I've got to leave guys.
[49:46.32]I got to take a shit.
[49:47.12]I have to take a big poop.
[49:48.87]Then I would leave.
[49:51.84]And then I would go to Holly after and go, man, that game.
[49:55.10]That game, man.
[49:55.80]Was it as bad as I remember?
[49:57.78]Was it as bad as I remember?
[49:59.74]I thought it was good.
[50:01.20]And I'll just rant for like an hour and 25 minutes.
[50:16.00]This is a totally, completely fabricated scenario.
[50:21.64]Alright, stop.
[50:22.36]I have to get out of this tutorial so I can play.
[50:26.24]Alright, let's open the cache screen.
[50:33.57]Okay.
[50:38.03]So this is how much... This is my cache management.
[50:40.93]Lower the rate guard's empty machines to less than 30%.
[50:48.45]Now, why is that?
[50:49.25]Guards should attempt to empty objects holding cash when they're this full.
[50:53.29]Okay, there's $2,500 in machines and there's $2,500 in the casino.
[50:57.12]Cash in the bank, $785,000.
[50:57.80]You are a backgrounds character in Friends.
[51:11.54]Are you saying that because I'm one of the people that just says nonsense and moves their mouth talking with a drink in their hand while, like, they do the scene in front of us?
[51:24.82]Like, what you're describing is I'm the person that I have that exact same conversation with one of the other extras, and it looks like I'm really talking and moving my hands, but I said almost nothing.
[51:38.23]I said almost nothing.
[51:39.99]Is that what you meant by that statement?
[51:44.57]no you bet your ass you bet your ass I would look directly in the camera if I was ever in if I was ever in like a background actor in one of these shows the camera's gonna go by and look directly in the lens and they're gonna edit it and they're gonna be like what the dude this guy looked right into the lens he looked right into the camera why
[52:13.68]The one thing they teach you in like acting school is the camera does not exist.
[52:20.59]And anytime you like look into the lens, it's like, eh, eh, eh.
[52:24.79]It's like playing Operation.
[52:25.69]It's like, eh, nope, wrong, wrong.
[52:27.43]Alright, let's go.
[52:33.76]Let's go.
[52:34.38]Let's go.
[52:34.84]We got it.
[52:35.32]We're done.
[52:36.28]I'm ready.
[52:38.32]It's time to make our casino.

[52:51.85]Instant research, auto delivery, instant staff.
[52:54.41]That's fine.
[52:56.48]How much money should I start with?
[52:58.48]I'm going to say clean, cool $1,000,000.
[52:59.56]Clean, cool $1,000,000.
[53:17.27]So cool.
[53:20.56]Is Mr. Grains back?
[53:22.92]Well.
[53:24.58]Well.
[53:26.54]Stop talking.
[53:27.90]Stop talking.
[53:28.54]You're going to get me in trouble.
[53:31.68]Alright.
[53:32.44]How about just me?
[53:37.05]Alright.
[53:37.35]Pre-built starter map.
[53:46.21]No, I'm going to make my own.
[53:49.85]We know.
[53:50.49]You don't know.
[53:52.33]You don't have any idea.
[53:55.37]Alright, so this is where we're gonna go.
[53:58.41]132,000?
[54:04.02]What's going on?
[54:05.32]Is the fucking meteor hitting?
[54:06.80]Oh, okay.
[54:09.96]Why is it getting so dark?
[54:11.48]Why are we in the shadow?
[54:16.82]What is this?
[54:19.80]Oh, it's over here.
[54:20.44]Oh, I like this.
[54:21.76]$279,000.
[54:23.14]Business, hotel.
[54:35.19]Alright, so I make a hotel.
[54:36.45]Okay, I'm going to buy these both.
[54:38.35]This is going to be the hotel and this is going to be the casino.
[54:40.03]Alright, let's start here.
[54:42.44]Bingo. $279,000.
[54:53.74]You have no parking.
[54:56.34]Alright.
[54:56.88]Here's what I want to do.
[54:59.16]I want to have... Alright.
[55:01.94]What is this music?
[55:05.03]This is nice.
[55:05.53]Okay.
[55:07.67]Look at this area we got to work with.
[55:09.01]Alright.
[55:09.77]This is huge.
[55:11.09]Oh my goodness.
[55:12.03]This is way too much.
[55:14.47]This is too big.
[55:17.95]Uh...
[55:23.70]Okay, um... Let's just make a... I'm gonna have... This is the big lobby, right?
[55:31.28]The lobby's gonna go off to the hotel.
[55:34.75]So let's do... Here's this just opener.
[55:37.47]Like that.
[55:41.23]This is huge.
[55:41.69]This is gonna be a big lobby.
[55:42.67]And then leading over this way is the hotels.
[55:47.35]So it's gonna go... Yoink.
[55:52.36]You need to start a war with Pasta Italiano.
[55:55.50]That game is fucking crazy.
[55:58.25]I wish they would remake that game.
[56:04.85]Dude, for those of you new viewers that don't know what that is, Casino Inc.
[56:11.13]is one of the most outrageous video games I think has ever been made.
[56:16.78]I can't even explain it.
[56:18.50]You need to go watch the VOD.
[56:20.85]That's all I can tell.
[56:21.47]Oh, go download it and play it on your own and just spoiler free and be like, holy shit, what the hell were they doing?
[56:27.47]It's like almost a perfect video game.
[56:30.93]Alright, so let's go over this way.
[56:32.01]This is going to be the hallway leading to the hotel.
[56:46.89]And this would be a bunch of rooms here.
[56:48.79]So this is like, alright, here's the hallway.
[56:53.50]Then... Can I just, wait, can I just do a big... Can I separate the rooms?
[57:04.48]Like, wait, hold on.
[57:13.91]Oh, I can do that.
[57:14.61]Alright.
[57:16.49]Let me do that.
[57:22.96]Never mind, I lied.
[57:24.08]That's going to be the table games room.
[57:29.88]This will be the hallway to the hotel.
[57:31.60]Hold on.
[57:54.65]Delete this.
[57:55.81]Do I get my money back if I delete stuff?
[58:10.20]I don't get my money back if I do this.
[58:15.58]How come I don't get my money back?
[58:21.30]Wait, actually, let's have a staff room right here.
[58:30.15]Where can I find your casino and play through?
[58:31.81]It's just be on YouTube.
[58:36.28]On the archive channel.
[58:39.20]OK, I need to figure this out.
[58:40.78]This is way too big.
[58:42.00]So this would be like a casino floor.
[58:45.48]We add a wall here along.
[58:50.52]Yeah, like this, I like a bathroom here, right?
[58:52.75]This bathroom.
[58:58.45]uh what else is in a casino is casino inc a good purchase you know I don't know how well it runs on windows 11 or 10 or anything right because I played it what three two three years ago was even on windows 10 two three years ago I don't know does it still run okay so that looks good
[59:29.42]I need to get rid of this.
[59:30.06]Because this is going to be slots.
[59:34.00]This would be table games.
[59:35.92]And this is going to be the hotel.
[59:39.02]Jesus.
[59:39.66]Alright.
[59:47.24]Hotel.
[59:56.82]This hotel is right here and it's going to be sick.
[60:07.95]build okay here we go uh alright to me this is a trap right this feels like I'm gonna walk in here and it's gonna the room's gonna be like spikes are gonna shoot out
[60:36.33]Hold on.
[60:37.19]Can I put this higher?
[60:37.95]I don't know.
[60:41.57]Why is the ceiling so low?
[60:44.61]I don't get it.
[60:46.36]I don't care.
[60:46.76]Whatever.
[60:47.04]I need outdoor paint.
[60:57.36]I need an ATM.
[60:58.50]Oh, right.
[60:59.28]Hold on.
[61:01.69]You only have one floor?
[61:08.91]This is some Hey Arnold shit, that's what I'm saying.
[61:17.48]Okay, um, I needed, first of all, I need a front door.
[61:24.76]Door.
[61:26.65]Commercial double door.
[61:30.33]No, it should be one of these.
[61:35.98]Oh, wait.
[61:36.78]This is where the garbage... I can't have the front door be where the trash gets taken out?
[61:41.12]I feel like I'm making this in Roblox.
[62:06.87]Okay, that's fine for now.
[62:08.67]Wait, I want this to be different.
[62:16.01]Dude, don't people make full video games in Roblox that you can't even tell the difference?
[62:24.00]You can't tell that it was made in Roblox because every pixel has been changed to every single, every ounce of paint changed.
[62:34.72]That's crazy.
[62:37.69]That's ridiculous.
[62:39.69]Something about that is really cool.
[62:42.31]Okay, so what's this?
[62:44.41]Ooh!
[62:58.31]That's better.
[63:02.73]Can they even get through that?
[63:03.93]No, delete that.
[63:18.82]How do I get... This looks stupid with the grass.
[63:26.90]I need, like, a new floor.
[63:27.86]Um, excuse me?
[63:36.14]Okay, floor.
[63:43.20]Terrain, there we go.
[63:47.98]Here, you're gonna get the red carpet experience.
[63:53.80]What?
[63:59.33]Okay, that's fine.
[64:21.87]What are you talking about?
[64:22.55]Must be an indoor floor.
[64:26.12]Why?
[64:26.34]Okay, well.
[64:41.25]That's annoying.
[64:48.97]This is actually fun.
[64:52.56]I don't care.
[64:53.04]It's fine.
[64:53.36]Alright, let's do... Ooh, accommodations.
[65:00.20]Okay, hotel.
[65:00.76]I gotta put a sign here, right?
[65:02.54]A desk to sell rooms to your... Oh, here we go.
[65:15.11]Wait, why is it like a... Wizard of Oz door.
[65:19.87]Hold on, move this.
[65:21.48]I don't understand.
[65:22.00]Why is it like this?
[65:32.93]Uh, alright.
[65:33.37]Door?
[65:33.79]And an interior door.
[65:45.56]Holy shit.
[65:46.16]Alright.
[65:46.68]We need a bathroom, too.
[65:51.31]Hit indoor door.
[65:52.97]Hotel room zone.
[65:58.10]Okay.
[66:00.58]This is the hotels.
[66:01.34]I need to move this a little bit.
[66:11.18]No, because this is where somebody at the window takes the... They pay.
[66:13.74]There's a washing machine?
[66:18.09]Alright.
[66:18.47]I need a door.
[66:19.77]Just a door.
[66:20.41]Door.
[66:25.56]Commercial single door.
[66:29.16]There.
[66:29.48]Alright.
[66:35.52]This is not a single hotel room, right?
[66:40.00]This room or one of the sub-rooms should contain a bed.
[66:46.34]This is a... No, it's not.
[66:50.94]Well, whatever.
[66:51.37]We make it fucking 10 grand a week to rent it out.
[66:57.02]No, it's not.
[66:57.52]I can make little sub-rooms, it said.
[66:58.91]Alright, so I need a staff.
[67:02.81]This hotel requires a laundry zone.
[67:04.73]No, it doesn't.
[67:05.23]A hotel requires laundry?
[67:11.18]Since when?
[67:11.60]Okay, well, laundry.
[67:16.66]Let's make the laundry zone.
[67:20.24]We'll make that, like, over here.
[67:22.10]Yeah, that's perfect.
[67:22.66]Over here.
[67:40.49]Okay, this is laundry.
[67:45.82]Uh, laundry.
[67:52.88]Can't be reached from the bus stop.
[67:56.35]Why do I care that it can... I don't care.
[67:58.43]Oh, it's because it has to go door to door, door, door, door.
[68:03.36]I get you.
[68:03.70]Okay, I understand.
[68:04.20]Alright, that's the laundry room.
[68:06.32]Let me do this later.
[68:07.28]Let's get the fucking casino games.
[68:08.80]How much money do I have?
[68:10.00]I got money.
[68:10.58]Okay, laundry washing machine.
[68:16.61]How many should I do?
[68:17.11]Like two or three?
[68:31.87]Okay, and then what else does this need?
[68:37.14]Requires to be protected behind a staff door.
[68:40.42]You got it?
[68:43.44]Okay.
[68:46.50]Add storage shelves to increase the capacity.
[68:52.92]Easy.
[68:56.46]Wait, this side probably, yeah, we're here.
[69:04.08]Look at that!
[69:07.46]And we'll put a painting.
[69:10.24]Alright, cool.
[69:11.60]Our laundry room is here.
[69:17.10]How much does it cost to use the laundry room?
[69:25.45]How much does this cost to use the laundry room?
[69:31.33]Make the wallpaper very loud.
[69:37.40]Uh, I will.
[69:39.15]In a minute.
[69:41.87]Okay.
[69:42.55]First of all, we need to figure this out, because this is messed up.
[69:45.53]Because, yeah, this is all messed up.
[69:46.83]I gotta fix this.
[69:48.05]Immediately.
[69:51.78]That's not what I wanted to do.
[69:53.46]But... Uh... Oh, goddammit.
[70:00.37]Whatever.
[70:00.67]How do I just... I wanna get rid of the wall.
[70:11.79]I just want to get rid of the wall.
[70:20.59]There we go.
[70:21.05]There we go.
[70:26.51]Yeah, I don't want a door.
[70:30.46]When you move around a casino floor, you don't open up doors to go to the next area.
[70:35.64]You just walk.
[70:41.58]There's not a single steam room door.
[70:45.34]No, it's just open.
[70:54.67]But it has to be this because we have to pay to get in here.
[71:01.93]Why is there no facecam?
[71:02.87]Yeah, I don't really feel that well today.
[71:05.86]Um.
[71:08.15]I've been, like, really fucking sloppy recently.
[71:10.65]That's another reason why the green screen's not tonight.
[71:13.85]But I still wanted to stream.
[71:14.97]I didn't want to just not stream.
[71:18.97]Because I want to stream.
[71:20.81]It's fun.
[71:21.97]I enjoy it.
[71:24.77]But we'll do it again.
[71:25.95]It's ready to go.
[71:27.32]The playlist, I think, has part two playlist, I think, 120 videos?
[71:30.76]So...
[71:34.89]There's a lot to watch.
[71:36.55]I just didn't want to start laughing and just blow a gasket in my brain and get a migraine and have to turn the stream off in half an hour.
[71:44.55]You know what I mean?
[71:45.29]I'd rather just save it.
[71:49.66]Especially considering I want to be ready for baseball in like a week and a half.
[71:54.26]So I just got to be careful.
[71:56.38]I don't want to mess anything up before doing the baseball stream.
[72:02.14]Alright.
[72:02.40]But anyways, let's go.
[72:06.97]What do I want to do?
[72:26.46]What are you doing?
[72:27.22]Flying a spaceship.
[72:30.36]But you didn't know what that was?
[72:31.76]Find that person out.
[72:37.57]Okay, let's... I don't want to get overwhelmed by this blueprint.
[72:47.50]Okay, let's... I'm going to do tables first.
[72:51.39]Table games.
[72:54.57]Or should I do decorations first?
[72:56.41]Yes.
[72:57.47]That's what we're doing.
[73:03.66]Hello?
[73:05.46]Okay, floor.
[73:06.26]Carpet.
[73:08.93]What's wrong?
[73:11.17]Oh, there we go.
[73:11.48]Alright, I want... Ooh, that's cool looking, but I can't undo it, so I need to make sure I like it.
[73:17.76]This is cool.
[73:20.20]Do casino floors all have this wild, actually cool grandma carpet?
[73:28.71]It's like if grandma wore a hat backwards and, like, rode a skateboard.
[73:35.83]That's the kind of carpet that's in every casino.
[73:43.48]Yuck.
[73:45.10]I like that.
[73:50.41]Hold on.
[73:51.01]I'm not picking it yet.
[73:52.87]That hurts my head.
[73:55.51]These are all just magic eyes.
[73:56.69]Yeah, look at that.
[74:14.84]I don't want it to be the entire casino.
[74:20.86]That's a bowling alley?
[74:21.82]Yeah, bowling alleys and casinos are very similar.
[74:26.85]That's true.
[74:28.03]Why is that?
[74:31.13]You know, I think it's like the same mindset of casino design and bowling alley design.
[74:38.13]That's true.
[74:44.55]And bus seats.
[74:53.20]Yeah.
[74:55.58]Oh, I know why it's to hide the puke.
[74:58.06]Right?
[75:00.48]Yeah.
[75:02.84]It makes sure that it hides all the puke.
[75:04.72]If you puke on this carpet, no one's ever gonna know.
[75:13.72]That's a good... That's true.
[75:15.64]You're right.
[75:18.16]Should it be that the whole way?
[75:19.14]No.
[75:22.66]This one's kind of boring.
[75:31.62]I like the blue.
[75:41.67]The first one?
[75:43.50]Wow.
[75:48.28]That could be in a different room.
[75:50.22]Would that be the hotel room floor?
[75:51.49]Oh, wood.
[75:58.11]What about this wood?
[76:02.54]That looks alright.
[76:12.06]Wait what?
[76:12.56]How much is this?
[76:13.32]$28,000 that's it?
[76:15.00]That's so stupid
[76:37.41]Alright, I got to make a decision here.
[76:38.55]This is indecisive.
[76:41.91]This is fine.
[76:49.41]No, that's ugly.
[76:54.48]I like this one.
[76:56.80]Yeah, this one's good.
[77:16.87]laser tag.
[77:18.69]Yeah, I mean, it's starting to kind of look like a like a Nickelodeon TV set.
[77:25.56]That's fine, though.
[77:33.54]We didn't do the walls.
[77:34.48]Alright, so this has to go all the way to the wall.
[77:36.36]Come on, this looks fucking ugly.
[77:38.44]Get it right.
[77:39.28]Get it right or don't stream.
[77:40.92]You know what I mean?
[77:42.86]Get it right or turn off the stream.
[77:46.83]OK, uh walls.
[77:50.29]How much is bricks?
[78:02.20]I need it exterior.
[78:03.36]Ooh, I kind of like that.
[78:19.66]Hmm.
[78:21.80]Oh, I like this.
[78:30.33]It's so bad.
[78:31.31]Why?
[78:31.59]I like it looks fine.
[78:32.89]It looks cool.
[78:37.23]What's the problem with that?
[78:48.64]If my grandma had a mansion, it would look like this.
[78:52.56]Yeah.
[78:52.94]And your grandma would be having the time of her life here.
[78:55.16]Okay.
[78:59.24]So.
[79:01.19]Let's continue.
[79:01.99]We haven't even put the games in yet.
[79:06.85]I need interior paint.
[79:10.77]Wallpaper.
[79:24.85]Patrons are complaining of headaches every time they come to the casino.
[79:32.57]Uh... Themed walls?
[79:38.64]I mean, now it's a casino.
[79:46.74]Every casino has to be Caesar themed!
[79:50.10]Or Roman!
[79:51.70]Oh, we're the Romans!
[79:54.47]Why is that?
[79:57.61]Why is every, why do all bunch of casinos have to be like, look where it's Roman?
[80:07.48]You know, three casinos.
[80:09.50]No, that's that, that Roman kind of architecture is everywhere down here.
[80:16.01]Bro, I live here.
[80:19.55]What?
[80:26.80]I don't live in a casino.
[80:32.17]That was my actually moment.
[80:35.61]I actually don't hate this.
[80:37.41]Hold on.
[80:44.35]Yeah, definitely this.
[80:45.75]Definitely this.
[80:49.91]That's perfect.
[81:02.86]It's so ugly.
[81:04.64]Most casinos are kind of ugly.
[81:07.50]They just are.
[81:08.18]They're very tacky, a lot of them.
[81:12.94]It's like Roman statues and bright green and pink and orange and magenta colors.
[81:21.23]They're wacky.
[81:22.67]I think that's why I like them.
[81:25.25]They're wacky places.
[81:29.09]There's a fountain with a lion.
[81:31.03]You know, a lion statue.
[81:34.06]Guys, there's a casino out here that has a fucking pirate ship in it.
[81:38.79]It's bizarre.
[81:40.49]Oh, yeah, there's a big pirate ship here.
[81:42.47]Alright.
[81:46.12]It's cool.
[81:46.92]It's just weird and tacky.
[81:57.56]It adds taste.
[81:59.68]Oh no, you said ADHD taste.
[82:01.93]I thought you were being nice.
[82:03.09]Okay, um... So this is gonna be bathroom.
[82:25.30]This room looks delicious.
[82:29.70]I want to come in here and just breathe the air in here.
[82:33.03]Without the toilets.
[82:34.17]I'm just saying the empty room.
[82:46.21]I just mean this.
[82:47.82]The way that it looks.
[82:48.48]I feel like it's clean and crisp.
[82:51.58]Forget about what goes in here after.
[82:58.44]I'm doing it.
[83:00.27]Ugh.
[83:02.73]Are you high?
[83:03.41]No, I'm not.
[83:04.17]Guys, I'm not high.
[83:05.25]Alright, that's the bathroom.
[83:12.41]Dude, this is gonna be sick.
[83:14.53]I need like a staff room too.
[83:15.61]Alright, now I can start putting stuff down.
[83:21.11]So.
[83:23.55]I want table games here.
[83:27.19]Back a rat.
[83:28.64]Sweet game.
[83:29.72]Blackjack.
[83:31.32]Mmm, I don't really, you know, I don't like Blackjack that much anymore.
[83:34.93]I love Blackjack, but you know what?
[83:36.29]The game kind of sucks, if I'm honest.
[83:40.77]Pygal.
[83:41.61]That's the game.
[83:43.86]Now that's the game.
[83:45.10]This game, let me tell you something about Pygal.
[83:46.84]Pygal.
[83:48.69]Ludwig put me onto this game.
[83:50.79]And you can sit there all day and not lose any money.
[83:54.48]Like, well, let me preface that by saying something very important.
[83:58.12]Yes, you will lose money.
[83:59.44]But, like, it's the slowest fucking game in the whole casino.
[84:04.87]You can just sit there and just do little bets.
[84:09.25]And it's so easy to push on Pygal.
[84:14.72]Blackjack, it's like, oh, you lose, oh, you lose, you lose, you lose, you lose, you lose.
[84:20.08]It takes, like, it takes, like, fucking a full two or three minutes to do a game of Pygo.
[84:24.38]You just sit there.
[84:25.53]You can do fucking small little bets.
[84:26.91]It doesn't even matter.
[84:31.85]Don't play at the fucking casino, though.
[84:38.51]Is that fun?
[84:41.04]Gambling is only fun if you go in with a small amount of money, a certain small amount of money that you know you're never going to get back, and it's a form of entertainment that you do very rarely.
[84:54.12]Every so often, rarely, is how I find fun with the game.
[85:00.23]Rarely.
[85:01.81]I live in Vegas, right?
[85:03.89]I know how fucked up it can be.
[85:06.43]Trust me.
[85:07.97]But...
[85:09.93]I would be dishonest if I told you that I didn't enjoy playing the games.
[85:15.21]Maybe every few months.
[85:19.22]But that's it.
[85:23.80]Rarely it's a... What do you mean?
[85:26.88]I moved there.
[85:27.86]Dude, fuck off.
[85:30.86]We know you live in Wisconsin.
[85:32.98]What if I was just lying about living here the whole time?
[85:39.33]No, but PyGow is slow.
[85:42.49]The last couple times I played Blackjack, it's just like, okay, dealer hit 20, dealer hit 21, dealer hit 19, dealer has 20.
[85:50.83]Okay, well, what the fuck?
[85:52.59]It's been 10 minutes.
[85:58.90]He lives in Wisconsin.
[86:04.64]Yeah, gambling should only be a form of entertainment very occasionally.
[86:08.28]That's how I feel about it.
[86:11.01]That's truly how I feel about it.
[86:12.95]But I do enjoy it.
[86:15.39]Go out with friends, sit around a table, and just hang out.
[86:20.57]They got casinos in Wisconsin.
[86:22.97]Do they actually?
[86:23.61]Do they?
[86:23.95]I actually have no idea.
[86:27.52]You just seem bad.
[86:29.38]You guys, you can't be bad at a casino game.
[86:31.40]That's the thing you have to be.
[86:32.60]You want to talk about fucking what you need to get out of your head?
[86:36.04]You cannot be good at a casino game.
[86:39.02]There is no being good at a casino game unless it's poker.
[86:43.85]Poker, yes, there's a lot going on there.
[86:47.95]Poker, and some of those poker-oriented games are.
[86:52.51]Everything else at the casino is just throw a million dice in the air and did you win?
[87:01.27]There's people that go and they sit down at a slot machine and they go, no, no, no.
[87:04.45]I know the secret.
[87:05.39]There is no secret.
[87:06.55]The secret is the gigantic math problem that's playing behind the reels.
[87:11.28]That's it.
[87:12.66]Even Blackjack.
[87:13.48]Blackjack has a low house edge, but it's just random on... I mean, unless you're like counting cards, which you can't do.
[87:21.68]And a lot of these casinos, make sure you're not doing that.
[87:24.78]They have like 8 plus 10 plus deck games.
[87:31.30]So that's not going to happen.
[87:35.78]It's illegal.
[87:38.73]You can't.
[87:39.11]It's not illegal.
[87:40.01]What?
[87:44.05]But anyways.
[87:46.59]Like roulette too.
[87:47.51]Like there is no like, no, no, no, no, no.
[87:49.19]I know the number it's going to be.
[87:50.31]No, you don't know the number, man.
[87:52.79]You just don't.
[87:53.37]You don't.
[87:53.81]It's literally a ball that spins around in a circle and lands on a random slot.
[88:00.52]You might get lucky, yeah, and when you do, nice.
[88:03.48]It's fucking fun.
[88:04.23]But that's it.
[88:10.53]How come I can't unlock these?
[88:15.05]I need to research ultimate house advantage.
[88:18.59]Oh, I need a cashier cage.
[88:20.73]Okay, I need a cashier cage.
[88:22.03]Let's put that in here.
[88:29.93]But I'm not going to hear this thing.
[88:31.73]I'm not going to sit here and tell you that what you shouldn't do with your money, right?
[88:38.31]But I'm going to tell you to be careful with your money.
[88:40.34]That's it.
[88:43.04]Be fucking careful.
[88:45.42]It's really easy to get caught up in this shit.
[88:47.26]Just be fucking careful.
[88:50.22]Genuinely is.
[88:51.14]How come this is not flush?
[88:57.38]Why is this not flush?
[89:07.36]I want this to be flush with the wall.
[89:08.80]What the hell?
[89:10.04]It can't be flush?
[89:15.84]Oh, there needs to be a way for the catcher to get in.
[89:18.61]Oh, they're gonna be stuck.
[89:24.31]I'm sitting here going, why can't I make this flush against the wall?
[89:26.97]Because they would never be able to leave.
[89:28.38]Okay, I get it.
[89:31.22]I'll have to.
[89:37.16]Oops.
[89:46.43]Somebody said, what do I feel about pineapple vodka?
[89:48.69]That's a great drink.
[89:50.89]That's a fantastic beverage.
[89:52.13]I would recommend if you are of the age to drink alcohol and responsibly can drink.
[89:58.81]It's a drink to drink.
[90:00.25]It's just simple.
[90:01.62]There's no bullshit.
[90:02.98]Not a bunch of nonsense.
[90:07.69]That's another thing.
[90:08.33]Guys, I only drink like five times, six times a year, too.
[90:14.67]As our most celebrated, most intelligent scholar, Ben Franklin said, all things in moderation.
[90:22.10]Ben Franklin was the smartest person in the world.
[90:23.60]That's why he's on the 100.
[90:25.12]Ben's not on the 1.
[90:26.46]Ben's not on the 5.
[90:28.00]Ben's on the $100 bill.
[90:30.82]Why do you think that is?
[90:32.48]Why do you think Ben Franklin's on the 100?
[90:42.72]He's 100!
[90:50.90]Is that the guy from Jerma Rumble?
[90:54.32]You know, there's a 500 and a 1000.
[90:54.98]Yeah, okay.
[90:55.22]What's the 1000?
[91:15.32]There's no $1,000 note?
[91:16.02]There's no $1,000 denomination.
[91:31.63]Wait, my... $1,000 bill.
[91:43.26]Like its smaller cousin, the $1,000 bill was discontinued in 1969.
[91:48.38]Who was on it?
[91:53.51]Grover Cleveland was on the $1,000 bill?
[91:58.17]And William McKinley was on the $500 bill.
[92:01.41]They're not in circulation anymore.
[92:04.20]Wait, Grover Cleveland was on the $1,000?
[92:06.12]What the hell?
[92:13.88]It existed, but it doesn't exist anymore.
[92:15.28]Alright, let's get a couple of roulette tables.
[92:19.17]Ooh, we need ATMs.
[92:34.97]ATM Andy.
[92:39.07]But yeah, when you go into the casino, that money you bring in is you need to go in with the mindset of this is already gone.
[92:47.78]It's gone.
[92:48.66]Treat it like it's already gone.
[92:50.30]And that's it.
[92:51.46]Don't do anything else.
[92:53.74]You are going to lose it.
[92:55.62]You might win.
[92:56.42]Well, cool.
[92:56.88]You did it.
[92:57.22]Hooray.
[92:59.37]Treat it like it's gone.
[93:00.33]And that's it.
[93:00.77]And have a good time with your friends.
[93:01.89]If you ever go to the... And this is not... Obviously, I'm not trying to endorse a casino.
[93:05.95]I'm just saying.
[93:06.47]That's how you should do it.
[93:07.85]Don't do it any other fucking way.
[93:09.73]I'm telling you.
[93:11.23]Please listen to me.
[93:14.70]If you're ever at a casino and you bring whatever you're going to bring for the night or for the weekend or for the week, that's it.
[93:22.32]And it's gone.
[93:24.20]Do not take that extra step to be like, alright, nah, I kind of blew through that.
[93:29.80]I'm gonna go to the ATM again.
[93:32.22]No.
[93:32.70]Don't do it.
[93:33.10]Don't do it.
[93:33.84]Don't.
[93:35.16]Don't do it.
[93:36.18]Don't.
[93:36.82]Listen to me.
[93:37.22]Are you listening?
[93:38.10]Don't do that.
[93:38.96]I want you to think of me saying that, if you ever do that.
[93:47.53]And then if you're over 21, go get yourself a vodka pineapple.
[93:51.79]You know?
[93:53.07]Just sip on it.
[93:53.62]Just fucking walk around.
[93:54.58]La la.
[93:56.68]Okay.
[94:01.17]Texas Hold'em.
[94:01.93]There should be another room for Texas Hold'em, right?
[94:10.36]I'll do what I want with my money.
[94:12.90]And you are completely... Yeah, that's up to you.
[94:15.94]Just be fucking careful.
[94:17.20]Ben Franklin... Ben Franklin's gonna, like, turn into, like, a force ghost.
[94:21.74]He's gonna be in front of you.
[94:23.26]He's gonna have a cigar in his mouth.
[94:26.06]He's gonna have... He's gonna have, like, a fucking invention in one hand.
[94:31.31]And, like, in his other hand, it's gonna be a...
[94:35.18]I almost just said chainsaw.
[94:37.02]He's going to just show up.
[94:37.96]He's going to have a kite in one hand and a chainsaw on the other hand.
[94:43.58]And he force goes in front of you.
[94:46.24]And I don't know what Ben Franklin sounded like, but I imagine it was something like this.
[94:50.87]What you should do is absolutely not find your way back to the ATM.
[94:57.29]Turn around.
[94:59.55]All things in moderation, my friend.
[95:02.37]Leave the casino.
[95:04.56]and go with your friends somewhere else.
[95:09.90]And then he just .
[95:10.86]And he's cutting like a bush.
[95:12.33]John Oliver.
[95:26.80]What if you're on a winning streak?
[95:28.70]Oh, if you're on a winning streak, then the Ben Franklin goes, boom, poofs up.
[95:32.81]He's like, he's with two ladies.
[95:34.53]He's got a cigar.
[95:35.93]Let me tell you what you should do here.
[95:38.19]Put it all on black.
[95:40.21]All things in moderation.
[95:44.87]There's like two, there's like three people by, there's like, there's like three dudes behind him, like cheering him on.
[96:00.35]And then you can say, Ben, you're full of shit, weren't you?
[96:03.39]And then he just, he looks at you, he gives you a wink, and he like, tick, tick, he tick, ticks the cigar down.
[96:10.42]Poof, and he's gone.
[96:18.58]The house always, he invented gambling.
[96:20.76]No, he didn't.
[96:31.93]I don't... I want this room to be... Yeah, poker's in a different room.
[96:35.03]It always is.
[96:39.09]Blackjack.
[96:39.98]Game sucks.
[96:40.76]I don't like Blackjack now.
[96:43.24]Me and Blackjack are not talking at the moment.
[97:12.65]Mmm, I don't like that placement.
[97:15.05]I hate this stupid bacon carpet Why?
[97:20.55]Alright, so let me uh this is this is Ari for now We have blackjack roulette We're gonna do slots in here These are expensive, why are these so expensive?
[97:44.96]Holy shit, dude, really?
[98:13.12]How do they do it at a casino?
[98:14.50]They kind of do it like this.
[98:29.11]What the fuck is he doing?
[98:30.09]I'm telling you, this is how they set him up.
[98:34.03]This is how they do it.
[98:37.75]Although this should be over here.
[98:45.30]XGC.
[98:58.99]And then.
[99:05.11]This.

[99:47.05]I need the bar right in the middle.
[100:02.14]So we're gonna go like this.
[100:03.48]Let me do the bar first.
[100:07.64]Ooh.
[100:10.00]Uh-huh.
[100:10.16]Mm-hmm.
[100:25.03]Right there.
[100:28.13]Boom.
[100:31.80]You promised.
[100:32.20]I didn't do it the right way.
[100:36.04]Alright.
[100:37.38]Betting.
[100:39.24]A big TV.
[100:41.00]Oh, nice.
[100:42.99]Wait, there's going to be a section where they can... Hold on.
[100:52.06]You're gonna be able to watch TV somewhere, right?
[100:53.76]I should put this over here.
[100:55.02]Yeah.
[100:55.54]No, I don't like the bar in the middle bullshit.
[101:00.13]Get rid of that.
[101:04.67]Uh... How do I deselect this?
[101:07.05]Sorry, I'll use it in a minute.
[101:09.89]Shit, I don't wanna just... I'm gonna lose the money.
[101:11.80]Do the bar on the right?
[101:19.32]Do a timeout corner.
[101:25.69]Rotate it?
[101:27.69]Yeah, but this doesn't work over here.
[101:29.03]Oh, I hate that.
[101:33.51]It's, I don't know, I hate this.
[101:34.73]Because it can't be flush.
[101:40.28]Because this would be a way in and out.
[101:42.24]I hate it.
[101:50.98]I mean, whatever.
[101:56.26]Make a couple TVs.
[102:02.79]T-TV.
[102:03.35]Here we go.
[102:14.25]Put a small TV in there.
[102:17.84]What should go in the middle here?
[102:18.80]A fountain.
[102:20.50]Some kind of cool decoration.
[102:23.74]No slots in here.
[102:26.49]Lots are all over here.
[102:28.47]I'm going to do another one of these corners.
[102:32.13]Over here.
[102:33.15]Oh, the Game Jack.
[102:37.81]Put the Statue of Liberty in the middle.
[102:41.70]That's so dumb.
[102:52.04]We'll do another corner here.
[103:05.87]Did I screw it up?
[103:08.03]Yeah, I did.
[103:27.41]Here we go.
[103:35.05]Should I put this in the corner here or the corner here?
[103:37.29]Here comes the big... Look at that.
[103:38.69]Listen to this.
[103:44.45]It's kind of too far.
[103:45.09]It's too close to the door.
[103:47.66]When are the customers going to enter?
[103:50.62]In a minute.
[103:50.96]I just need to make sure I have everything ready.
[103:58.02]That's okay right there, right?
[104:05.18]That's fine.
[104:06.22]That's fine.
[104:07.30]And I'm going to do one row, one row, and then I'm going to put toilets in, make the hole, and then we're going to open this shit up in public.
[104:31.08]So green screen got delayed.
[104:32.48]Yes, green screen got delayed.
[104:34.10]Not by very long.
[104:35.36]Less than a week.
[104:37.52]I just wanted to just chill and just play a game today for reasons that I described a little bit, but I can go over again.
[104:46.37]I woke up with a pretty bad migraine and laughing really hard at funny, hilarious media is stuff I probably don't want to do right now.
[104:56.01]Okay.
[104:56.53]Okay.
[104:58.43]I need to make a second floor.
[104:59.49]Well, hold on.
[104:59.95]Let me do the first floor first.
[105:01.35]Okay, what do I need?
[105:08.11]Business services.
[105:09.11]Okay.
[105:09.91]Printing station.
[105:10.85]Computer desk.
[105:11.65]Alright.
[105:12.03]Conference rooms.
[105:12.93]I need like a staff room, don't I?
[105:23.62]Do I need a staff room?
[105:28.70]Okay, so let's do... Sink with cabinet.
[105:34.05]Sink.
[105:34.31]I thought this was a TV.
[105:45.29]Lose the hotel.
[105:54.64]Why would I delete the hotel?
[106:05.65]No, I'm not ready for the... I can do the hotel in a second.
[106:08.45]Hold on.
[106:10.37]How much do you have beds?
[106:20.93]This is all I can put?
[106:24.67]Wait.
[106:25.21]Single... Requires researching a grand hotel.
[106:28.74]All I can do is single beds?
[106:34.16]Here we go.
[106:42.27]There it is.
[106:42.67]Oh yeah, we're going to make tons of money.
[106:45.34]It's going to be insane.
[107:11.44]And then a couple down here.
[107:28.39]Shit.
[107:28.83]No, go back, go back, go back.
[107:31.33]I screwed it up.
[107:31.77]Delete it.
[107:35.41]Public bathroom in the hotel.
[107:37.94]No, these are big enough for a bed.
[107:39.50]Hold on.
[107:44.85]No, what the fuck?
[107:47.21]Wait, can I not make this a bathroom?
[107:52.47]I'm so confused.
[107:55.22]Oh, okay, private.
[107:55.98]Here we go.
[107:56.90]Yep.
[108:23.67]Okay.
[108:29.17]Just make a singular long bathroom.
[108:32.11]No.
[108:35.58]Half the room is the bathroom.
[108:37.32]You know how uncomfortable a small bathroom is?
[108:43.89]I've stayed in hotels before where the bathroom was as big as an airplane bathroom.
[108:48.95]And it sucks.
[108:54.14]I need room.
[108:57.58]I need space.
[108:58.38]I need room in the bathroom.
[109:00.80]I hate the shit where you're sitting on the toilet and the toilet paper is essentially almost touching your leg.
[109:09.23]And the sink is touching your elbow.
[109:13.33]And the... No, give me some room.
[109:16.46]Give me some room.
[109:17.04]I need room.
[109:28.19]I've cursed out loud when I open up the door to the bathroom and I see that the sink is within elbow's reach of the toilet.
[109:37.32]And it's like wood.
[109:39.12]It's like a box.
[109:39.96]And you can literally just sit and squeeze in there.
[109:41.84]I don't know why people... And some of these hotels are like fucking hundreds of dollars a night.
[109:46.41]You know what I mean?
[109:49.23]I'm going to go off here.
[109:51.29]This is a very important thing to talk about.
[109:53.94]I don't get... I don't... I don't... Let me preface this by saying I don't want to... I'm not going to... I hope I don't piss anybody off with this, but I don't think I will.
[110:01.58]Hotels that are, like, kind of old, and that's the point, where it's like, oh, yeah, the room is, like, fucking old, and the bathroom is old, and the plumbing is old, and the whole thing is fucking old.
[110:12.59]Oh, that'll be... that'll be $300 or $400 a night.
[110:17.53]I... I... I want a... I want a bathroom that's fucking new.
[110:22.13]I don't want to turn the shower on and it's like... And I have to sit there and wait for the water to get hot.
[110:29.70]Like 20 minutes for the water to get hot.
[110:31.44]You know what I mean?
[110:33.16]That's an overstatement, but you know what I mean.
[110:37.16]It's like just old for the sake of being old.
[110:39.54]And they cost more than just staying at like a regular ass hotel.
[110:51.15]This is all I want.
[110:52.91]I want a clean room, small, with just a bed, a functioning television, and a clean bathroom.
[111:02.77]And the plumbing works.
[111:05.34]And it's not like, oh, well, you know, this place has been here for, you know, 500 years or whatever.
[111:11.24]And the plumbing is 500 years old, too.
[111:14.24]Give me $500 a night.
[111:18.70]I don't need a fancy hotel.
[111:21.30]Just something with a bed.
[111:22.20]It's clean.
[111:24.21]And it's ready to go.
[111:29.41]This place sucks.
[111:30.33]It's not done yet.
[111:31.61]So hold off on that.
[111:35.71]Dude, America hasn't existed for 500 years.
[111:49.07]But you know what I'm talking about?
[111:49.99]Where it's like, hey, by the way, we took this old school gym and we made it a hotel.
[111:57.41]You know what I mean?
[111:58.01]Like, I just want a fucking Holiday Inn.
[112:01.42]Just give me like a Marriott.
[112:03.38]I don't care.
[112:13.62]My college dorm was an old hotel.
[112:18.29]Millionaire streamer.
[112:19.21]No, no, you don't you're missing the point here.
[112:22.07]I don't want to spend $400 a night on one of these I just want to go to the I just want to go get the continental breakfast at the Holiday Inn.
[112:32.42]I Just want to wake up and get the cereal the orange juice.
[112:34.46]What's by the way?
[112:36.06]Continental orange juice is the best orange juice you could ever drink.
[112:40.04]I don't know why I love it so much the one that comes out of the machine in the lobby and
[112:48.64]It's the machine.
[112:49.58]And it has... The machine is probably from like 1995.
[112:54.10]And when you... They all make the same noise.
[112:55.86]When you go up and you press the button.
[112:58.13]You take your glass and it goes... And it's the most delicious orange juice I've ever had.
[113:05.89]Dude, that's just radioactive.
[113:15.68]It's full of mold.
[113:22.67]the best part is you dude listen to me you can go up to that machine as many times as you want that old barely functioning orange juice machine you can go up there 10 times if you want it's bottomless oj the con it's a continental breakfast
[113:52.09]flavor.
[113:58.13]Yeah, and sometimes they have bagels, they have cereal, where you peel the top of the lid off and you just put some milk in it.
[114:04.75]There's always coffee, and let me tell you, the coffee at a continental breakfast is so good.
[114:10.89]I went to just a random two or three star hotel one time.
[114:13.85]I forget what it was.
[114:15.46]But they were changing that shit out.
[114:17.16]And they were just like... I remember going, where the fuck was it?
[114:20.76]I'm trying to remember what chain it was.
[114:23.16]But the person that was working there was switching the coffee out.
[114:26.07]It was like brand new.
[114:27.53]How's the coffee?
[114:28.69]Coffee's great.
[114:30.13]Coffee's great, man.
[114:30.85]This is fantastic.
[114:32.21]Hey, how's that orange juice?
[114:33.67]It's clean.
[114:34.11]It's crystal.
[114:34.77]It's delicious.
[114:37.01]You know what I mean?
[114:37.53]It was great.
[114:39.05]I love hotels.
[114:40.13]I really do.
[114:41.17]I swear to God.
[114:42.99]I love just like a Holiday Inn.
[114:44.99]Or like a Marriott or something.
[114:47.55]Just like a three-star, two-star hotel.
[114:49.49]I like waving to the clerk.
[114:57.93]Very friendly.
[114:58.67]Like, how are you?
[114:59.63]Have a great day.
[115:00.51]You have a good fucking day.
[115:03.05]That continental orange juice is the best orange juice I've ever had in my life.
[115:12.10]Anyways, I haven't pressed play in two hours.
[115:17.50]And I'm giving myself a headache.
[115:18.68]Let me just relax.
[115:28.23]Okay.
[115:29.65]Please play the game.
[115:30.91]I know.
[115:33.35]Come on, I gotta go off on my funny comedy podcast rants.
[115:37.67]Alright.
[115:41.23]I gotta fix this.
[115:45.56]Do a hotel ranking?
[115:48.28]What's the worst hotel I've ever stayed at?
[115:50.64]I could probably... I don't know.
[115:54.22]It wasn't a chain.
[115:55.36]I'll tell you that.
[115:56.54]I'm certain of that.
[115:57.20]Dude, give it up.
[116:14.89]I don't know what that means.
[116:16.87]You mean like the game?
[116:17.92]Do you mean like streaming?
[116:19.00]Do you mean talking about two star, two and a half star hotels?
[116:24.12]What do you mean?
[116:32.46]What about Motel 6?
[116:36.49]Um, no, no, it's got to be.
[116:39.61]I'm telling you, no.
[116:42.07]No, not a Motel 6.
[116:49.43]I don't, alright, I don't like hotels where the door is just like, there you are.
[116:56.15]Bill Burr had a hysterical talking point about this.
[117:03.54]what it was like in those hotels or those motels where it's just like the door and then there you are just lying in bed and it's just like if somebody it's just like the outside world is right there and there's a door right there and you're lying in the bed he talks about this and he talks about how he's like you're not ready like if somebody's just there just like breaks the door and it's like gonna get you you're just like lying there it's fucking hilarious it's a hysterical rant
[117:50.17]A motel?
[117:50.71]Yeah, motels freak me out.
[117:57.00]I want like the door and then like the other door to my room.
[118:04.96]Should there be snacks in here?
[118:13.98]You're gonna put any windows in here?
[118:15.62]No.
[118:17.61]There's no time for that.
[118:18.53]Alright.
[118:19.03]Beds.
[118:20.40]Let me just get through this so I can hurry up and play this game already.
[119:11.68]It's been like three hours.
[119:12.78]It's been two.
[119:14.22]And to be fair, the first... The first, like, 40 minutes, I wasn't even playing.
[119:22.45]Turn it.
[119:28.88]Turn it!
[119:46.98]Why is this a different color?
[119:53.06]Why is this a different color?
[120:00.39]No, it's a hotel room.
[120:06.80]Okay, hotel room.
[120:28.80]This is gonna make a shitload of money.
[120:30.36]You guys have no idea.
[120:59.45]I'm small.
[121:00.79]I'm a little guy, right?
[121:02.61]I don't think I fit on this bed.
[121:06.49]This is like a tube of toothpaste.
[121:08.51]This is so small.
[121:16.80]I mean, I'm smaller.
[121:18.06]I feel like I wouldn't fit.
[121:21.22]I need a big bed.
[121:22.57]I'm going to tell you.
[121:24.09]I need a big bed.
[121:25.99]That's what I need.
[121:29.68]I like just brawling around.
[121:32.00]I take my comfort very seriously.
[121:37.21]Okay.
[121:47.57]So now I need to put... What else goes in, like, a hotel room?
[121:58.12]Uh...
[122:05.59]Toilet stall?
[122:07.33]Oh no, that's over here.
[122:14.59]I'll do that later.
[122:16.43]Okay, what else goes in their room?
[122:26.52]Oh shit, they need sinks.
[122:28.16]Do they really need sinks?
[122:30.40]Let's be honest.
[122:31.70]Oh my god, they all need showers too.
[122:33.66]This is such a huge investment.
[122:36.29]This is an insane investment.
[122:37.93]Now they're gonna wash their hands in the shower.
[122:56.96]Just turn the shower on and get in the shower.
[123:07.56]Can you imagine?
[123:09.30]Can you imagine somebody being like, oh, hey, yeah, dude, we'll get down there.
[123:12.60]Oh, casino.
[123:13.26]Let's go.
[123:13.77]Yeah, man.
[123:15.17]Oh, let's go to the blackjack.
[123:16.21]Hold on.
[123:16.41]I got to wash my hands real quick.
[123:18.57]And they just turn the shower on and they just get in the shower and they take a shower, a full shower.
[123:31.45]I'm telling you, I'm just going down.
[123:37.13]I'm just going to be like, I'll meet you down there.
[123:40.82]Hey, if you find me at the craps table.
[123:48.94]Alright, so now they have a bathroom.
[123:51.17]I need I need they need a goddamn sink, don't they?
[123:53.51]Whatever, fine.
[123:56.49]Spending so much money here.
[123:57.57]Look, this is what I hate the most.
[124:01.19]This is what I hate more than anything.
[124:07.88]tiny little toilet in this fucking sink right next to your head.
[124:11.51]And the toilet paper is right here.
[124:15.21]It's right there and it's touching you and you have to like, you have to reach your arm out of the way in any place, any bathroom, any hotel room where I cannot use the hand closest to the toilet paper to get the toilet paper.
[124:32.29]I have to move that arm out of the way, go cross-section across my body, and pull it with the other hand.
[124:39.23]Get that out of here.
[124:41.45]That's annoying.
[124:48.66]That's what I'm doing.
[125:05.67]This is ugly.
[125:09.08]It's not... It doesn't matter how ugly it is.
[125:11.26]It needs to function.
[125:18.08]I'm telling you, you put a 1995 orange juice dispenser in one of these, I don't care.
[125:23.32]I don't care.
[125:23.66]I don't care if there are bugs in this hotel room.
[125:28.85]I thought my game crashed.
[125:29.71]Okay.
[125:31.57]Okay.
[125:41.24]Alright, what else do I need?
[125:44.08]Accommodations.
[125:47.05]There we go, like a computer desk.
[125:49.73]1200 bucks.
[125:50.51]Wait, jacuzzis?
[125:54.29]Exercise bike?
[125:58.07]They don't... They don't need any more of this.
[126:00.35]Bedroom entertainment.
[126:05.65]Wine rack.
[126:06.35]Get out of here.
[126:07.17]Okay, everyone needs a TV.
[126:14.53]Are there any smaller TVs?
[126:17.64]OK, there we go.
[126:43.89]Wait, why is this more expensive?
[126:46.51]What the, what is happening?
[126:49.93]Why is this more expensive than the plasma screen, gigantic television?
[127:07.15]Uh, that's kind of, that's a little weird.
[127:09.91]That's weird.
[127:38.04]Ooh, swanky.
[127:47.33]Okay, everyone has a TV, right?
[127:49.03]Everyone's got a TV.
[127:56.17]Everybody's got... Alright, ooh, wait.
[128:24.33]Okay, we have... Wait!
[128:27.07]Do I need... Wait, I don't get it.
[128:29.66]Is this a reception?
[128:31.90]Do I need a reception here?
[128:38.30]Before you come in?
[128:42.71]Or is that technically a reception?
[128:45.31]Is this a reception?
[128:45.99]I don't get it.
[128:50.21]I don't know.
[129:04.17]Movie theater ticket taker.
[129:09.19]I think this is good to go.
[129:13.03]How do I charge an exorbitant amount for these rooms?
[129:30.62]How do I charge money for them?
[129:46.45]Okay.
[129:47.93]Neon toilet one, neon, wait, these are neon, wait, these are toilets?
[129:53.78]What?

[131:31.86]Just do one singular toilet.
[131:38.14]I'm doing privacy.
[131:42.30]I'm doing privacy.
[131:44.28]What are you talking about?
[131:45.13]I don't want one gigantic bathroom.
[131:49.45]Should I just do one huge bathroom?
[131:56.73]Just one huge bathroom.
[132:04.80]Make it a maze.
[132:11.24]This one huge communal bathroom.
[132:17.16]Alright, fine.

[132:19.26]I was going to make like privacy.

[132:31.73]No.
[132:38.17]How do I delete this shit?
[132:53.71]Do I just put toilets around the casino?
[133:05.42]I'm gonna put... Yeah, fuck this.
[133:07.11]We don't need a bathroom.
[133:09.09]Why waste the space?
[133:16.69]Why waste the space?
[133:17.51]People are gonna be showering at like the blackjack table.
[133:30.40]I can't...
[133:38.93]This is the most fucked up thing ever.
[134:00.81]There's somebody just sitting here playing, like, Wheel of Fortune slots.
[134:05.62]And there's somebody sitting in this chair.
[134:09.98]And you have to come over here and take a shit behind them?
[134:15.64]How could you do that?
[134:20.35]There's no way this works.
[134:22.73]I doubt this is actually going to work.
[134:23.93]I'm going to get, like, an error message that's like, oh, no, I can't be in the...
[134:27.49]failed toilet stall.
[134:28.97]Yeah, see, requires enclosed space.
[134:34.88]This room requires the same.
[134:41.35]But hold on, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[134:58.84]I don't understand.
[135:00.66]Wait, can I just do two walls?
[135:11.77]Must be a functional private bathroom zone.
[135:16.09]Aww.
[135:20.11]Place the stall first.
[135:30.33]Oh, shit.

[136:09.34]What the hell have you done?
[136:11.92]What have you done?
[136:12.68]I just wanted to get rid of the wall.
[136:20.81]What have you done?

[137:47.67]I would not go to the bathroom in this.
[137:51.00]Would not.
[138:00.84]The best part about this is no one will play at this machine or this one.
[138:04.46]No one's gonna play at these two.
[138:10.99]Dude, let's just be a slot machine on the other side.
[138:14.50]This should be a slot built in here.

[143:59.05]I looked over, I was like, what is going on?
[144:00.51]And when I zoomed in, I thought that's how she was naked.
[144:10.70]What?
[144:11.56]Don't put that shit everywhere.

[146:33.10]Here comes the casino boss.
[146:33.96]Come on.
[146:34.92]Stop driving by.
[146:35.96]I have to close it off.

[146:49.19]Yeah.
[146:49.97]Alright.
[146:50.57]I'll have to make a bathroom.
[146:53.45]How come it's so empty?
[146:54.15]Because this place sucks.
[147:06.14]It'll get better once the table games start and we can get the hotel going.
[147:08.82]Are we staying here?
[147:21.41]Must be merged with another private room.
[147:24.01]What?
[147:24.23]I don't understand what's going on.
[147:31.69]Wait, there are no rooms?
[147:35.21]This must not be inside of a staff-protected area.
[147:39.87]Excuse me?
[147:50.80]Hotel room one.
[147:52.22]Oh, OK, so.
[147:57.03]What do I do about that?
[148:10.41]Lobby is a room, but how do I?
[148:12.51]How do I fix that?
[148:16.61]D zone.
[148:19.71]OK.
[148:21.61]This has been de-zoned and now the room requires its own wardrobe.
[148:29.46]Get out of here with this bullshit.
[148:32.84]I need to put a wardrobe in these.
[148:57.05]This is the kind of room that I would wake up in.
[149:00.62]And I... I don't know why I just thought of this.
[149:06.96]Me and my family were on vacation one time.
[149:09.04]This was a long time ago.
[149:09.75]This was when we were, like, little kids.
[149:12.51]I was probably, I don't know, I want to say... Maybe ten?
[149:17.83]And we, like, rented out this cabin or something.
[149:21.12]And we were on, like, a big vacation to go out and, like, go camping and shit.
[149:25.98]And they had this big bedroom that was upstairs.
[149:29.74]It was like this kind of big loft.
[149:32.23]And the ceiling was kind of slanted down.
[149:36.63]And our beds were kind of up against the walls.
[149:40.61]So because the way the ceilings were slanted, when you were lying in the bed, your head, the ceiling kind of went diagonal over your head in a way.
[149:53.82]I'm trying to think of exactly how the architecture was.
[149:59.81]But my brother woke up in the morning and he just got right out of bed in the morning and just smashed his head against the ceiling.
[150:11.55]It was the way that the ceiling was angled.
[150:13.41]I forget how it happened.
[150:17.92]But he just woke up and was like, oh, yeah, it just it was so excited to get out of bed and just smashed his head against the ceiling.
[150:28.15]I don't know if they were like wooden frames or something.
[150:33.66]I've done that before.
[150:34.56]Clown family.
[150:51.29]This stuck with me for a decade.
[150:56.16]A decade, two decades, three decades.
[150:58.41]We were at the mall one time and we were walking around and there was this, you know in the mall how there's those big standing advertising kiosk things?
[151:10.41]They have like three or four sides.
[151:12.83]It's like a huge LED, like a big screen, right?
[151:15.63]And it's like, there's an ad on this side or something on this side, something on this side.
[151:19.82]I don't know why.
[151:21.26]There was a Goldie Hawn movie that we were walking, me and my brother and my family was in the mall.
[151:28.47]And my brother, for some reason, thought this Goldie Hawn movie poster...
[151:34.81]He's like, oh, look, look, it's Goldie Hawn.
[151:37.37]I don't know why this was such a funny thing.
[151:40.07]It was like he was just pointing at stuff.
[151:42.09]And I will never forget this.
[151:43.19]He was just sitting there pointing and laughing while we were walking at this Goldie Hawn poster.
[151:47.88]This is a long time ago.
[151:50.04]And I was standing right next to him, walking alongside him.
[151:53.02]And in my peripheral, there was one of those stand-up kind of metal plastic stands with another ad on it.
[152:02.58]And he walked his face and head directly into the thing.
[152:08.07]It was like... That was such a horrible voice crack.
[152:12.33]But his face went like... And he smashed his head into it.
[152:17.79]I swear to God, it's one of the funniest Three Stooges things I've ever seen in my whole life.
[152:23.72]I don't know, it stuck with me forever.
[152:26.60]That would just jump, that would jump into my brain.
[152:29.35]Sometimes, with my brother just laughing, pointing, like... Like, he was not, he did not know this was coming, and he got rocked.
[152:39.69]And I think it was, like, the funniest thing I've ever seen.
[152:41.70]That's a Three Stooges thing.
[152:48.48]I'm telling you, it's, it was funny.
[152:52.50]Your brother is the funny one.
[152:53.74]My brother is hilarious.
[152:56.98]My brother is hysterical.
[153:03.12]Cartoon DNA.
[153:15.20]It just pops in sometimes.
[153:16.46]Because it was immediately after he started laughing.
[153:20.00]It was just like karma.
[153:22.45]Like, it was just... We were walking, walking... Ha ha ha, bang!
[153:26.55]Like, it was... He didn't even have one to two full seconds to laugh.
[153:33.24]It's like... I don't know how he didn't see this coming.
[153:35.28]You should bring your family on stream.
[153:40.78]I already did that.
[153:45.82]Okay, is this good?
[153:46.48]These are good, right?
[153:53.94]This problem is solved now, right?
[153:58.16]Alright, we got patrons.
[153:59.68]People are here.
[154:13.15]Yeah, alright.
[154:13.75]Where's our income?
[154:18.60]You must have at least one pit boss.
[154:23.85]What's wrong with the pit boss office?
[154:25.55]It's here.
[154:29.87]Pit boss?
[154:30.69]I need a computer desk.
[154:33.64]Okay.
[154:35.72]There.
[154:37.58]Where's the pit boss?
[154:45.26]Let's go.
[155:11.58]Here we go!
[155:12.10]Here we go!
[155:14.34]Where's the delivery?
[155:20.66]Delivery of coins and notes by... Oh, I don't have a security guard.
[155:23.68]Oh, shit.
[155:26.48]Security requires researching advanced security.
[155:30.50]Where do I do that? ...
[155:46.59]Oh, pizza.
[156:11.94]Oh, you're going to sit down and a blackjack.
[156:17.50]Why?
[156:20.75]Roulette.
[156:21.11]Alright, what are you going to do?
[156:24.35]Nice, nice, nice.
[156:24.95]Alright, how much does it cost?
[156:26.65]We're on peak hours right now, right?
[156:40.10]Just do $1 on 1 100 times.
[156:49.47]You actually can't do that.
[156:54.97]11 a.m.
[156:55.43]is peak.
[156:56.03]Oh, what?
[156:56.35]Hold on.
[156:56.67]Let's fix this.
[157:02.52]Why is nobody using the fucking hotel?
[157:04.58]I mean, hold on.
[157:05.98]Why would I swear?
[157:07.42]Why is nobody using the freaking hotel?
[157:15.20]Oh, it's because it's ugly.
[157:16.16]Hold on.
[157:41.94]Alright, now I need tile.
[157:45.95]Oh, this is cute.
[157:46.75]I guess.
[157:50.29]I don't know.
[157:52.79]What the freak?
[158:00.60]Now I need... No, it's got to be something weird, something wacky.
[158:05.58]That's kind of wacky.
[158:10.21]What do you do?
[158:12.37]What does this person do?
[158:13.29]I need more machines.
[158:21.15]These are filling up fast.
[158:23.11]Why is nobody drinking?
[158:24.09]Oh, it's because it's 12 o'clock.
[158:25.78]What do you think about the casino?
[158:32.56]I want to gain some confidence before I play anything risky.
[158:34.74]Alright, these are popular over here.
[158:35.78]I need more.
[158:46.24]This is an El Casino.
[158:48.12]Yeah, I need... Oh, pause, pause, pause.
[158:49.48]These people are leaving because there's not enough slots.
[158:51.62]Alright, I need more of these.
[159:05.47]Let's go a line like this.
[159:06.69]Make sure there's enough room.
[159:26.82]Okay.
[159:28.36]That should be good for a little bit.
[159:29.18]What are you buying?
[159:39.68]Ooh, nice.
[159:40.26]I thought this was a photo booth.

[160:51.17]Can nobody cash out their chips?
[160:56.09]Where's research?
[160:58.41]That's the problem.
[161:02.69]Utilities, staff, security facilities.
[161:06.95]Requires advanced security.
[161:10.59]Where do I research?
[161:17.80]A lot of people coming in.
[161:23.90]I need a payout receipt
[161:29.02]Let's go!

[241:05.58]That sounds alright.
[241:21.07]People are pissed.
[241:26.35]What, a rip-off?
[241:28.22]I come with airplane peanuts.
[241:33.48]Oh, you lost $2,000.
[241:34.11]That's alright.
[241:36.49]Here's some stale pretzels.
[241:42.50]And by the way, there's only six in the bag.
[241:58.14]Is there AC in the casino?
[242:01.12]Maybe not.
[242:02.90]Whoa, I just won $20,000.
[242:03.89]What was that?
[242:04.67]Taxes?

[242:05.73]What is up with that?
[242:29.31]I'm doing alright.
[242:29.85]I didn't take a loan out or anything.
[242:35.25]It's... How many days has it been?
[242:40.46]It's been three days.
[242:43.50]And I had to pay that much in taxes?
[242:44.94]Oh, I pay taxes every day?

[245:27.96]The hotel's not making any freaking money.
[245:32.80]Nobody wants to play the table games.
[245:36.94]The food and the slots are what's making the money right now.
[245:50.65]Stealing from... Oh!
[245:52.35]Oh!
[245:54.30]Okay, we're good.
[245:55.77]Somebody stole from the ATM.

[246:09.29]Who cares?

[254:20.00]Oh wait.
[254:44.20]I thought they were going to be changing colors.

[256:54.32]Ahem.
[257:21.18]He's here.
[257:22.36]This feels so bad.
[257:23.78]This cost me $1,200 to rent this fucking space out.
[257:47.24]I'm having fun.
[258:26.77]It's so bright in here.
[258:29.85]Nobody wants to be in a room like this dancing around.
[258:33.04]You're going to have that overexposed iPhone face.
[258:36.88]Nobody wants to be in here.
[258:44.91]It's like a bathroom mirror.
[258:47.15]Nobody wants to be in here.
[258:51.57]Except for me, of course.
[259:14.38]Hey dude!
[259:16.50]There's free drinks in the dance room!
[259:21.62]They're giving away two free drink tickets!
[259:23.90]I thought that lady was pregnant for a second.
[259:26.81]I was like, what?
[259:29.53]Two drink tickets, let's go!
[259:40.98]Will somebody come in?
[259:45.79]Somebody go into the dance floor, why?
[259:47.77]Alright, I'll give somebody $30 if they come in and dance for five minutes.

[260:06.96]Anyone?
[260:14.58]Put a bar in there?
[260:15.50]I've been on one second.
[260:37.61]Honestly, I... I ain't going in here.
[260:45.21]with this one guy in here alone.
[260:46.39]You know what I mean?
[260:48.03]There's something weird about this.
[261:07.55]No, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[261:10.55]Please, please, please, please!
[261:37.87]I came in here to get the hundred bucks.
[261:47.96]I scared him off.
[261:48.84]No, I didn't.
[261:59.12]Guys, all these speakers are on and turned up all the way to 10 with no song on it.
[262:07.49]takes somebody to play the fart reverb and that guy's dead.
[262:11.59]That guy is gonna instantly die.
[262:13.13]That guy's gonna blow across the room and he'll just be splatted against this wall.
[262:34.01]You play it.
[262:40.35]Is this going to be loud?
[262:41.53]This might be really loud.
[262:42.79]I'm serious.
[262:43.75]This could be loud as hell.
[263:07.38]You're close.
[263:56.02]Why does this video exist?
[263:58.30]Ow, my fucking head.
[263:59.42]This video is called One Hour of Silence, Occasionally Broken Up by Reverb Fart.
[264:08.63]What purpose does this video serve?
[264:13.91]I'm talking, okay, so when you hear that sound, I'm talking his arms and legs are both in the air, forward, at a 90 degree angle.
[264:24.36]You know what I mean?
[264:24.80]His arms are right out in front of him.
[264:26.12]Legs, it's like he's sitting in a chair and his arms out.
[264:29.06]Flying backwards.
[264:31.26]500 miles per hour.
[264:32.40]And he just explodes, like splatters against the back wall.
[264:41.79]Just leave it on?
[264:56.29]This is not a $100,000 room.
[264:58.09]What a waste of money.
[265:00.79]There needs to be one speaker in the room, not 50.
[265:03.30]Put it on times two speed?
[265:23.72]The most replayed part of the video is here.
[265:31.58]Do half speed?
[265:46.23]It's on 0.25 speed.
[265:49.67]Actually, I have no idea when it's going to happen again.
[265:52.13]It might take an hour.
[266:00.39]Why do they not have any eyes?
[266:09.21]Pour a whole can of Pepsi into... No.
[266:13.07]Relax.
[266:15.96]Are people drinking out of this?
[266:23.84]I'm waiting for it to happen.
[266:25.30]Wait.
[266:25.82]Who didn't clean this up?
[266:47.79]What is he doing?
[266:51.09]Did he just scoop it back into her stall?
[266:53.29]He just brushed it underneath the stall.
[267:01.78]Whatever.
[267:02.12]Oh my goodness.
[267:02.58]Sorry.
[267:17.47]The doors are broken?
[267:18.55]I mean, they're... Wait.
[267:24.00]Oh, okay.
[267:24.42]Alright, what else can I research?
[267:41.15]I have money.
[267:43.87]Attractions.
[267:47.76]Probably the theater, right?
[267:48.78]No, all this stuff is free.
[267:49.96]I gotta make money.
[267:52.45]Gym.
[268:00.20]More food?
[268:09.72]Oh my god, it's scary!
[268:29.39]This is like a fart.
[268:31.30]This is like a wormhole opening.
[268:33.90]It's like a fucking Doctor Strange circle.
[268:52.50]That was a fucking Doctor Strange circle.
[268:54.47]That's not even funny, but it is.
[268:58.55]Why?
[268:58.97]I hate this.
[269:00.59]That's exactly what I'm talking about.
[269:10.50]Exactly what I was talking about.
[269:12.38]VRJosh just put something over here.
[269:15.15]This is exactly what I see in my brain.
[269:19.79]Alright.
[269:20.27]I need to slow down.
[269:20.95]I actually have to settle down before it's going to cause me a problem.
[269:23.91]I need to relax.
[269:30.17]Ugh.
[269:44.33]Hold on.
[269:50.98]What is this from?
[269:56.25]That is yes.
[270:13.45]It's from the Picard Star Trek spin-off?
[270:27.25]No, that's from Breaking Bad.
[270:28.69]It's when Mike gets hit by a nuclear fart bomb.
[270:43.75]What?
[270:44.17]What?
[270:44.41]What is this?
[270:46.84]Ugh.
[270:49.06]Oh my goodness.
[270:49.84]Okay.
[270:51.10]So... What was... Oh yeah.
[270:53.50]I had the gym.
[270:56.26]Ugh.
[270:56.95]What does it sound like when it's times two speed?
[270:58.65]I'm curious.
[271:05.89]That's not really that big of a...
[271:13.10]This one's fart with extra reverb.
[271:19.19]Alright, I'm done with that.
[271:22.93]Jeremy, you're five years old.
[271:25.09]I don't know.
[271:25.41]It's only that that does it to me.
[271:33.44]Ugh.
[271:38.94]It doesn't even sound... The slowdown one just sounds like... God.
[271:42.01]God.
[271:44.55]Okay.
[271:47.45]I want to do an advertisement campaign.
[271:57.72]Where do I do that?
[271:59.60]Finance?
[272:02.44]Operations?
[272:06.22]Where do I do it?
[272:06.76]There we go.
[272:07.50]Alright, let's go for it.
[272:24.16]We're gonna get flooded.
[272:30.63]Please keep it on.
[272:31.29]I have nothing else.
[272:34.11]Keep it on.
[273:05.17]That scared the shit out of me because I opened it.
[273:07.27]Oh my god.
[273:18.19]This is so many people.
[273:25.53]Please, all of you, go to the dance hall.
[273:28.03]Or go get food.
[273:35.41]All of you go get food.
[273:43.45]Yeah, fill it up.
[273:49.64]Fill it up.
[273:56.28]There's so much floor space.
[273:57.34]Why are they in a single file line?
[273:58.88]I have no idea.
[274:03.99]There we go.
[274:04.27]Alright.
[274:04.57]Food, food, food, food, food.
[274:08.66]Even more people coming in.
[274:21.14]This is scary.
[274:36.96]They all come in here and then they all turn around and leave.
[275:15.70]Yes!
[275:21.25]What does G do?
[275:22.21]I keep seeing G pop up.
[275:23.13]It doesn't do anything.
[275:36.94]Only $2,800 from this so far.
[275:45.76]Yeah, they're doing the same route.
[275:47.94]They're like ants.
[275:51.49]They single file, do the same thing.
[275:54.61]No one walks over here.
[276:00.47]All the slots are empty.
[276:06.39]What are they, why are they avoiding every game?
[276:16.53]Is it too expensive?
[276:34.06]What?
[276:37.50]You have the worst odds in town.
[276:41.97]That's $5, $100 jackpot.
[276:54.87]What?
[276:58.63]Oh, yeah?
[277:00.42]Check that out.
[277:08.06]$10,000 jackpot.
[277:08.62]That'll get some asses in this seat.
[277:12.89]Let's go.
[277:27.08]Wait, what?
[277:38.13]That odds worth it for you?
[277:39.23]Hmm?
[277:42.33]How are these odds?
[277:45.05]Go.
[277:45.37]Let's go.
[277:47.82]That's still not enough?
[277:48.80]$10 with a $10,000.
[277:57.05]That's insane.
[278:16.80]It's one cent to bet.
[278:18.14]It's one cent.
[278:27.52]Let's go ahead and do a hard save here.
[278:38.61]It's one cent bets in a $10,000 jackpot.
[278:44.07]Is anybody even going to hit it?
[278:45.11]Did somebody hit it?
[278:54.00]I think somebody hit it.
[279:09.63]Urgent thirst.
[279:16.10]I'm surprised it doesn't hit more.
[279:25.83]Really?
[279:26.25]How is it?
[279:29.14]Where are all the people?
[279:43.56]Oh, it's 3 o'clock in the morning.
[279:45.62]It's 3 a.m.
[279:46.18]on a Thursday.
[279:47.72]I'm sorry, but if you knew that there was a casino in town that had a one cent bet and there was like a 5% chance to win 10 grand, you would bring camping equipment and sit here.
[280:05.29]And you would pack fucking 10 sandwiches.
[280:12.68]You wouldn't leave.
[280:13.40]5% odds.
[280:17.42]Yeah.
[280:21.38]See, this person's smart.
[280:30.33]They came with $295.
[280:30.87]No!
[280:31.03]What are you leaving?
[280:31.47]Wait a minute.
[280:31.91]That lady sat down with $295, lost three or four spins, and then left.
[280:42.47]Pissed.
[280:59.41]One cent.
[281:06.81]All you would have to do is hit this one time.
[281:12.11]And you would never lose ever, right?
[281:16.31]You just need to hit this once.
[281:18.47]It's a 5% chance to win 10 grand at one cent bet.
[281:23.17]How is nobody hit it yet?
[281:24.09]I'm not crazy, right?
[281:31.91]This costs one cent.
[281:34.75]Oh.
[281:38.47]That's still pretty damn good.
[281:44.07]Oh, the max prize is $100.
[281:46.31]Oh.
[281:50.47]Never mind.
[281:50.91]Okay, here we go.
[281:56.17]What, 10 million?
[282:07.92]Those odds are still crazy!
[282:21.66]$10 a spin.
[282:22.30]5% chance to win, what, $100,000?
[282:24.90]$10,000?
[282:24.92]$10,000?
[282:24.94]You have $20k.
[282:26.22]Alright, we'll change it back.
[282:45.35]Randomize those games.
[282:47.07]Randomize games and odds.
[282:53.07]You're actually delusional.
[282:55.01]Why?
[283:03.28]There's been no fart.
[283:04.64]That's interesting.
[283:10.44]Do bingo?
[283:11.02]Um... Uh... Uh... Uh...
[283:24.71]What a bust this was seriously.
[283:30.34]This was a bust and the biggest in the whole casino and they're the biggest bust.
[283:39.94]What else can I research?
[283:45.09]Instant delivery, longer, larger loads, better security.
[283:49.87]Celebrity guests.
[283:52.41]More marketing.
[283:57.69]I don't even have a second floor.
[284:12.36]You can invite the real Jerma to your casino.
[284:15.96]No, I'm probably going to call it.
[284:17.80]I don't want to push it too hard.
[284:25.07]This was fun, though.
[284:26.19]Not like Casino Inc.,
[284:30.43]um yeah we're supposed to do the green screen thing tonight um I got up with a migraine and I can already tell that it's a good thing we didn't do it because laughing at oh my god is it always going to be funny probably um
[285:04.49]I was actually going to say that I was having digestive problems.
[285:10.07]Because I really have been, you know that.
[285:14.50]Yeah, I just didn't want to be in like a laughing fit and make it even worse.
[285:18.78]And I can already tell from laughing at that.
[285:23.56]It's kind of creeping back up here again.
[285:27.05]So I'm going to call it.
[285:29.39]This coming week has a lot of stuff going on.
[285:38.02]There is.
[285:40.48]I'm going to stream it on Monday.
[285:43.98]Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday.
[285:47.40]And then green screen is definitely going to happen this coming weekend, because then after this weekend, that will be it for a few days.
[285:56.67]Because baseball is in just about just under two weeks.
[286:09.21]Yeah, not like Casino Wing.
[286:10.13]Casino Wing is a little more wild.
[286:13.41]This one's more of a simulation.
[286:14.54]This is still fun, though.
[286:15.26]This is actually still a fun game.
[286:16.64]I enjoyed my time playing it.
[286:22.38]These kind of sim management games can be fun.
[286:28.18]Yeah, green screen will be this coming weekend.
[286:29.92]This, like, next weekend.
[286:31.58]I can't foresee a reason why it wouldn't.
[286:34.21]I'm going to try to just get better...
[286:38.09]I really hope so.
[286:38.83]I got two weeks to really get back to normal.
[286:44.67]But I'll see you guys on Monday.
[286:47.00]Monday, we're probably going to do the Mortuary Assistant.
[286:52.50]Tuesday, I don't know.
[286:54.52]Wednesday is something really fun.
[286:56.20]Thursday is something really fun.
[286:57.53]Thursday is, I think, unless any plans change, Myth's Call of Duty event is going to be this coming Thursday, the 11th.
[287:06.33]So that should be fun, too.
[287:09.11]Wednesday, a nice big fun thing could be happening too.
[287:12.05]Yeah, I'll get on tomorrow night or yeah, tomorrow night I'll be here.
[287:20.46]We'll go over everything.
[287:22.74]But it's going to be probably at least three or four streams in a row.
[287:25.60]If for some reason I don't stream on Monday, then Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday essentially is what it's going to be.
[287:33.80]So there's going to be at least three or four in a row, which I'm not really used to doing, but you know,
[287:39.66]It's fun.
[287:42.12]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[287:42.96]See you soon.
[287:43.52]See you in a couple days, regardless of whenever it is.
[287:45.77]Take care of yourselves.
[287:54.09]Have a great night.
[287:58.68]See you soon.
[288:14.52]I wish I didn't have that muted.
[288:15.74]Alright, I'll see you later.
[288:26.99]Good night.
[288:27.41]Goodbye.
[288:27.87]Take care.
[288:28.24]Owen.
[288:36.00]Call your bubba.
[289:01.70]you
[289:36.62]you
