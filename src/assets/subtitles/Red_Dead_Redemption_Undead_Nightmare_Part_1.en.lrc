[01:07.84]Good evening.
[01:09.46]How are you?
[01:11.10]Today was a interesting day.
[01:16.56]Actually, it wasn't interesting at all.
[01:17.88]It was very, very uninteresting.
[01:20.67]It was a very lax to chill day and nothing really important happened.
[01:25.63]Well, something important happened.
[01:26.61]Didn't have electricity all day.
[01:29.05]That's kind of annoying.
[01:32.17]Spoilers, there are zombies.
[01:34.59]Well, whatever.
[01:36.46]Yeah, I woke up this morning and the electricity was just gone.
[01:42.85]And I didn't get it back till about two or three hours ago.
[01:45.99]So all the shit in the fridge, yike, you know what I mean?
[01:51.45]Not good.
[01:52.71]So I had to wait to go grocery shopping.
[01:57.23]And I didn't like install Undead Nightmare.
[02:01.35]So, like, I had to install Undead Nightmare and get that, like, ready to go.
[02:04.31]So that's why we're starting an hour plus late.
[02:10.29]Eat everything.
[02:11.62]What if you're not hungry?
[02:14.46]What if you're just not hungry?
[02:15.54]Alright, well, hold on.
[02:16.56]Let me just go grab my phone.
[02:18.52]I will be here.
[02:19.08]I'm going to do Undead Nightmare.
[02:22.26]Hopefully we can beat the whole thing in one stream.
[02:24.72]I don't know.
[02:25.02]Maybe not.
[02:25.58]We'll see.
[02:26.45]I might get bored.
[02:28.66]I don't know, there's multiplayer, too?
[02:30.10]Like, there's Red Dead Mo- There's two discs for the Game of the Year edition.
[02:34.98]There's Undead Nightmare and multiplayer.
[02:37.01]And, like, I might just jump in and just fucking throw a grenade at somebody, you know what I mean?
[02:40.87]So, give me one minute.
[02:41.73]We're starting soon.
[02:42.65]I just want to grab my phone.
[02:44.15]I'll be right back.
[04:44.54]Okay, let's begin.
[04:49.86]Vote right now.
[04:50.64]Wait, what do you mean, vote?
[04:54.32]We're not voting right now.
[04:56.52]I started the stream already.
[04:58.84]Let's vote for what game I'm going to play.
[05:00.78]Except Red Dead Redemption is on the screen.
[05:07.90]There we go.
[05:12.37]So, I hope everybody's having a good day.
[05:15.02]We last left Red Dead Redemption.
[05:18.70]Last night beat the game.
[05:22.88]More Garfield smut.
[05:26.51]We're going to pretend that didn't happen.
[05:30.85]Let's just hit start.
[05:32.01]Let's go ahead and get the opening cutscene started for Red Dead Redemption.
[05:35.43]Undisputed nightmare.
[05:38.84]I'm going to shut up.
[05:42.01]I actually, I opened, uh, streamer is a liar.
[05:44.92]Streamer is a fucking liar.
[05:46.68]Uh, I opened this already, just to make sure it was gonna run.
[05:51.58]So, like, we're gonna have to start, like, a new game.
[05:55.42]Even if I can.
[05:55.94]I don't even know if I can.
[05:58.22]Can I?
[05:58.50]I don't know.
[06:01.03]We'll find out.
[06:02.61]Uh, we're good.
[06:03.01]See, we're good.
[06:03.45]We're good.
[06:08.21]After months away, John Marston has returned to his loved ones.
[06:13.87]While trying to rebuild his ranch and win back the trust of his family, Marston awaits whatever life will throw at him.
[06:23.95]As he drives home one evening from an errand, he ponders whether a man can ever escape his past.
[06:31.46]Pretty good Vincent Price.
[06:32.40]He is a man who is ready for anything.
[06:37.96]Almost anything.
[06:44.34]Ah, mm-mm.
[06:44.76]That wasn't a good Vincent Price.
[06:45.88]Come on, man.
[06:50.05]You can do it much better than that.
[06:51.13]Bonus tingle.
[06:53.43]Thank you for the $20 right off the bat.
[07:06.24]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[07:07.10]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft, the series where I play Minecraft.
[07:10.93]This is going to be a single player Let's Play, and when I say Let's Play, I use that term pretty loosely because I'm an idiot in this game.
[07:17.84]You're going to see lots of fails.
[07:19.52]You're going to see lots of triumphs, at least I'm hoping so.
[07:24.86]Grab yourself a nice hot cup of coffee.
[07:26.96]What the fuck is this?
[07:28.04]Hot cup of cocoa.
[07:29.26]I got apple cider right here, freshly brewed.
[07:31.00]Let me take a sip.
[07:32.00]Ah, that's some good cider.
[07:33.30]Good.
[07:33.80]I'm so glad, my darling.
[07:36.50]When you finished your university education,
[07:38.36]Did you transcript my fucking first shitty episode of Minecraft five years ago?
[07:43.03]Really?
[07:43.89]Oh, thanks a lot for the 20 bucks, man.
[07:53.51]It's my intro.
[07:54.21]Oh, my God.
[07:54.97]Rascal, thank you for the $4.50.
[07:56.15]When you forget the last zero on your 500-bit.
[07:58.67]Oh, because you just gave 50 bits.
[08:00.13]I get you.
[08:00.67]Why isn't it called Red Undead Redemption?
[08:02.36]That's true.
[08:03.30]But thank you, Rascal.
[08:19.74]He's still alive.
[08:20.90]John Marston is still alive.
[08:22.50]He's alive.
[08:24.12]He's alive.
[08:25.54]That's a good Larry David.
[08:26.30]Let me work on that.
[08:27.46]He's alive.
[08:28.47]Oh, I can't believe it.
[08:30.13]He's alive.
[08:31.49]That's a perfect fucking Larry David.
[08:32.95]I got to work on that off stream.
[08:35.37]I thought he was with you off drinking in the fields.
[08:38.23]I mean working.
[08:39.53]That was like Larry David's I'm making like a satirical comment joke.
[08:42.52]A few hours ago after we busted that hammer working out in the meadow.
[08:46.52]Well, he's probably holed up in some place of ill repute waiting for the passing of the storm.
[08:52.44]I hope so.
[08:55.87]That was pretty bad.
[08:56.73]No, it wasn't.
[08:57.25]Come on.
[08:59.29]Hey, rule number one, don't insult the streamer.
[09:02.41]I know.
[09:03.75]Just a funny feeling I got.
[09:04.91]Rule number two, don't insult the streamer.
[09:06.87]Rule number three, respect the fucking streamer.
[09:14.10]I'm in a weird mood, guys.
[09:14.94]It's sometimes what happens.
[09:15.80]Well, talking about food, who's ready for some poisoning?
[09:21.48]Me, my darling.
[09:23.54]I am starving.
[09:29.48]What are you reading?
[09:32.96]Just some book about monsters.
[09:36.95]King of Wales, thanks for the three dollars.
[09:39.17]Tell me about it.
[09:40.33]Hello, ladies and gentlemen.
[09:41.09]Welcome to episode one of JermaCraft.
[09:43.56]No, I'm not reading this one again.
[09:44.60]That should suit me just fine.
[09:48.30]Thanks for the three bucks, but I'm not going to read my intro to an old Minecraft video.
[09:51.80]In ancient times, our Aztec warriors worshipped the sun, but during full moons, some of them worshipped the moon instead and upset the equilibrium effects.
[10:01.20]This is a long opening cutscene, huh?
[10:03.29]What it involves is there's this one guy and he goes out in search of...
[10:15.46]Is this the meme for the day?
[10:16.68]Probably.
[10:19.00]Why am I, like, staring at my son like this?
[10:22.38]Am I just not paying attention to what he's saying?
[10:30.19]Wow.
[10:31.49]I was just, like, not paying... I was just doing what John Marston was just doing to his son, but I'm doing that to the game.
[10:39.15]That's some fucking meta shit right there.
[10:42.17]Jack, get yourself to bed, boy.
[10:44.27]Try to get some sleep.
[10:45.79]Ain't you worried about Uncle?
[10:47.67]Sure.
[10:48.65]But he'll have to wait till morning, just like any other man would in his shoes.
[10:52.63]Good night, son.
[10:54.31]Don't stay up reading too late.
[10:59.96]I do miss this, though.
[11:00.86]Rockstar, like, really dropped the ball, I think, with GTA V. I do.
[11:08.44]Because... Well...
[11:12.53]Well, he's a zombie.
[11:15.43]What I was going to say is, I really do miss these full-on, complete episodes.
[11:24.58]Like you had the Battle of Gay Tony.
[11:26.32]You had the Lost and the Damned for GTA 4.
[11:31.64]Stuff like this in Red Dead.
[11:32.90]I miss those full, separate games inside the game.
[11:37.99]Like DLC storylines.
[11:40.89]They kind of just didn't do that in GTA 5.
[11:43.27]They were just like, here, buy a shark card.
[11:46.51]I miss that a lot.
[11:52.01]Can I keep this outfit on the whole time?
[11:53.75]This, like, pajamas outfit?
[11:59.78]That's pretty fast for a zombie.
[12:00.94]Ah!
[12:10.01]Did I pee my pants?
[12:10.89]Looks like I pissed my pants.
[12:18.71]No, no, it's just like weird shadow.
[12:22.31]Put Uncle out of his misery!
[12:24.18]Shoot the undead in the head to kill them instantly.
[12:26.16]Like that.
[12:28.26]Oh, shit.
[12:36.48]Why is John Marston's life so terrible?
[12:38.06]She's going to turn into a zombie.
[12:39.66]That's how this works, right?
[12:43.94]We all have these funny pajamas.
[12:46.50]I like it.
[13:02.71]He has a patch on his... Oh my god!
[13:05.77]That's not good.
[13:16.82]That's really not good.
[13:22.40]Oh dear.
[13:23.40]Well, here comes mom.
[13:27.11]Don't worry, guys.
[13:29.03]Maybe you should worry.
[13:34.40]Lasso.
[13:38.36]Alright.
[13:39.74]Where's the sun?
[13:40.86]Sorry, darling.
[13:41.38]It's for your own good.
[13:45.38]I can't... I think I gotta kill them, right?
[13:51.44]I thought... Isn't this how monsters work?
[13:53.76]I can't hogtie them.
[13:55.10]I gotta kill them.
[13:55.74]Come on, friend!
[14:06.02]Alright, alright.
[14:06.98]Alright, alright.
[14:07.54]I guess this is the only option.
[14:10.72]Tie him up.
[14:12.32]Golden guns unlocked.
[14:13.62]Kills with a golden.
[14:14.38]What was that?
[14:22.21]Thank you, Grimoire.
[14:23.27]For the two bucks.
[14:31.49]I love that I'm just keeping them here.
[14:33.81]They're brainless, mindless zombies now, and I'm just gonna keep them in the house.
[14:37.37]It's okay, we're normal.
[14:39.37]We're a normal family.
[14:40.57]And I'm just gonna go to work and come back and... We're gonna have dinner.
[14:45.48]Oh, we actually are gonna have dinner.
[14:50.70]That's... Alright, I was making like a dumb joke, but it's real.
[14:54.16]I don't know what the hell's gotten into you sick, crazy bastards or what I've done to you, but... I'm going to get help.
[15:01.24]I love it.
[15:01.48]Probably just a fever.
[15:02.02]Probably just a fever.
[15:02.64]Why does the son get toast and the mother gets a piece of meat?
[15:35.23]Oh, now I'm dressed.
[15:41.11]Nice.
[15:43.35]Who was that?
[15:43.85]What family member was that?
[15:44.87]Is that, like, long-lost cousins, like, Stanley?
[15:53.98]Do I still have a horse?
[15:58.44]I guess I do.
[16:01.53]But anyways, thank you Grimoire for the two bucks.
[16:03.11]Not sure if anyone mentioned it last stream, but you should check out Lasagna.
[16:08.40]Lasagna Cat.
[16:10.40]Is this a fucking Garfield reference?
[16:17.72]This isn't a Garfield reference, is it?
[16:21.38]Where are we off to?
[16:24.70]Well, this is different looking.
[16:29.18]It's a nice green map.
[16:31.36]Undead Nightmare, I guess.
[16:32.94]I thought that was Uncle.
[16:38.66]Hop over the fence.
[16:41.86]I like the tone of this game, this set, though.
[16:47.69]Looks a little different.
[16:48.91]Feels a little different.
[16:50.01]The music's different.
[16:53.03]Uncle Nightmare.
[16:53.73]Yeah, Undead Uncle.
[17:04.27]But what I was saying is the... Can you imagine how awesome a full, actual campaign DLC for GTA V would have been?
[17:15.89]And the stuff that they've added to GTA Online... Heists were cool.
[17:19.09]Heists is like, alright.
[17:20.24]But they were pumping up and hyping heists for like fucking two years.
[17:26.54]Besides heists.
[17:29.97]Like it's just been like here's some new outfits and some new cars and shit I Can't even imagine what they could have came up with with like a full-on DLC To continue with undead nightmare you can place waypoints.
[17:47.05]Yeah, I know So this is a full-on complete I don't have any items or anything let's pick that shotgun let's do the shotgun here
[17:59.38]I'm gonna blow some zombies heads off, that sounds like fun.
[18:09.64]Mr. Marston, sir!
[18:10.96]Marston!
[18:11.98]Oh, not this guy.
[18:12.74]How is this guy still alive?
[18:13.70]Professor, what are you doing here?
[18:15.95]I thought you went back to Yale.
[18:17.01]I did, but I came back for another round of research, and now all hell is quite literally broken loose.
[18:24.13]What is going on?
[18:24.99]This guy's going to be a zombie.
[18:25.81]I can't wait to shoot him in the face.
[18:26.73]I'm a man of science, a man of great learning, a thinker, a wise man, and I'll be honest with you, sir.
[18:31.72]I haven't got a fucking clue.
[18:34.87]He's the source.
[18:35.69]He's patient zero.
[18:36.83]He's the source of the infection.
[18:37.95]For those of you that have no idea what's happening...
[18:58.93]I'm just imagining people thinking I'm still in the middle of the Red Dead campaign.
[19:03.06]Why the fuck are there zombies now?
[19:07.38]This is the DLC for Red Dead Redemption.
[19:11.16]This is a separate campaign not connected at all to the main storyline.
[19:20.36]Wait a sec here.
[19:21.34]I completed Red Dead last night.
[19:22.50]I'm going to wander down that lonely, deserted street and get my back.
[19:26.23]This is a separate DLC campaign.
[19:28.29]Wait.
[19:29.25]You should stay with me, Professor.
[19:31.35]You haven't got a gun.
[19:32.37]No, no, it's okay.
[19:33.49]There's no need to worry.
[19:34.53]Everyone's already dead.
[19:36.31]I left my stuff with Mr. Nastass.
[19:38.29]You remember him?
[19:39.29]Indian fellow, dumb as bricks, but a good sort.
[19:43.88]Okay.
[19:45.12]We'll meet me in a couple minutes.
[19:46.58]Affirmative.
[19:47.28]A couple of minutes.
[19:48.41]Wait, the sound is out of sync again?
[19:50.31]Is that true?
[19:54.11]Oh, finally.
[19:55.17]Finally.
[19:56.11]Yes.
[19:56.69]I'm gonna be able to dispose of this guy.
[20:06.64]Who is it?
[20:07.18]Is it a character?
[20:07.72]Uh-oh.
[20:10.58]Uh-oh.
[20:13.60]Uh-oh.
[20:17.40]Alright, well then.
[20:19.24]That's good to go.
[20:20.32]Here he comes, here he comes.
[20:21.08]We gotta kill this guy really, really interestingly.
[20:24.10]Train.
[20:25.01]No.
[20:25.63]You've increased Deadeye during Undead Nightmare.
[20:27.53]Use this wisely to help take on hordes.
[20:30.61]What?
[20:31.63]Oh, you mean like these two.
[20:35.41]Bullets and shells are a valuable commodity in the Undead Nightmare.
[20:37.84]There are no shopkeepers, so use them as... Oh my god!
[20:42.04]What just happened?
[20:46.00]This is no ammo?
[20:47.85]Oh dear, okay.
[20:50.95]I'm just like training zombies behind me.
[20:54.43]I was about to talk a lot of shit about the horde.
[20:56.25]Where's this?
[20:56.65]I gotta at least kill the professor, right?
[20:59.39]Where is he?
[21:01.41]I gotta get him.
[21:01.99]I just gotta kill the professor and we're good.
[21:04.22]Okay, now we can run.
[21:10.62]Call of Duty zombie strats.
[21:17.90]That's so stupid.
[21:21.90]Anyone here?
[21:23.87]Hello?
[21:25.13]Training zombies like cod zombies.
[21:31.29]Come out.
[21:32.79]It's okay.
[21:33.47]Anybody still play Call of Duty zombies?
[21:35.61]Come out.
[21:36.50]I don't bite.
[21:37.74]Oh, shit.
[21:38.06]It's a style hand grenade.
[21:39.02]I mean... Come out.
[21:43.82]They call my family, mister.
[21:46.26]And mine, I fear.
[21:48.63]I saw my mama rip my daddy's face off.
[21:51.55]Call of Duty was like the thing that everybody cared about.
[21:54.39]They were happily married 20 years.
[21:57.65]I'm sorry.
[21:58.25]We were so glad to see my mama.
[22:03.84]Because she's been dead for three years from the smallpox.
[22:08.26]Your mama was dead?
[22:09.70]Close the borders.
[22:10.98]I saw her walk up onto the porch.
[22:15.34]And then boom!
[22:17.36]She ain't my daddy.
[22:21.41]You weren't, you weren't a bad man, mister.
[22:24.85]You weren't.
[22:26.49]Sure, he liked to drink, but he weren't bad.
[22:30.81]And, sure, he liked the company of women.
[22:34.33]You weren't bad, mister, you weren't.
[22:35.95]No one deserves to have their blood drunk.
[22:39.53]I mean, he knew how to use his fist.
[22:43.46]And if a woman spoke out her place, he reminded her of it and everything.
[22:48.63]And when my mama was dying, people said that he was lying with her sister.
[22:53.15]But that weren't true, mister, it weren't.
[22:55.95]But you said your mother was dead.
[22:57.35]Didn't have aim down sights, yeah, that's true.
[23:00.27]He's been dead a year.
[23:02.24]And then yesterday, he walked up that street eating dogs.
[23:06.38]And he loves animals.
[23:09.24]In my understanding, COD Zombies was more fun than regular Call of Duty, right?
[23:12.67]Yes, yes, yes, yes.
[23:13.23]So, the game audio... We're going to do a test to make sure.
[23:39.71]Oh, I actually get a torch now.
[23:46.53]I'm going to shoot the gun.
[23:48.81]No, I can't.
[23:49.37]I need ammo.
[23:49.65]Burn the ball.
[24:02.75]Burn the bodies and clear the undead at the Blackwater Cemetery.
[24:05.31]Okay, so let me just do something right now.
[24:10.09]You tell me what you... I can only shoot this gun one time, by the way.
[24:13.56]So, ready?
[24:14.62]Here we go.
[24:18.86]Do you hear the sound first?
[24:21.50]And then the animation?
[24:22.90]Or do you hear the sound after the animation?
[24:27.88]It's important.
[24:36.60]You hear the sound first.
[24:41.99]No, I'm not going to do it again.
[24:43.19]Audio... Okay, so here.
[24:45.07]Tell me how this sounds then.
[24:46.11]Let me try this.
[24:55.84]Okay.
[24:57.92]So, here we go.
[24:58.62]We're going to try this again.
[24:59.50]And... Is that better?
[25:03.08]Okay.
[25:07.87]Facecam and clap.
[25:08.87]No, the facecam wouldn't be correct because I'm on... Actually, no.
[25:16.43]I got a really good idea here.
[25:17.47]I'm going to conserve a lot of ammo.
[25:19.79]Better?
[25:20.25]Okay.
[25:22.23]Alright, come here.
[25:23.81]I need a hogtie.
[25:24.47]I got to hogtie people and then I got to kick them in the face until they die.
[25:28.45]Right?
[25:29.81]That would give me some good... I don't have like a... Okay, I got a torch.
[25:33.64]Easy.
[25:33.92]Watch this.
[25:36.80]What?
[25:37.00]How did he break...
[25:39.59]Okay.
[25:43.54]I wanna, like, burn this guy.
[25:44.40]How did he get... How did he just Houdini... It's just a fucking Dark Souls game now.
[25:57.46]Perfect.
[25:58.10]I don't even need to spend any fucking... I can just get ammo.
[26:02.56]Shock and ammo.
[26:03.44]Undead with ammo belts will usually have valuable ammo.
[26:05.76]Be sure to loot as many of them as you can.
[26:06.92]Why can I not like this guy?
[26:17.77]Nothing personal.
[26:19.43]Can I just throw him off the edge?
[26:20.83]Can I climb this with him?
[26:26.41]Can I just jump on top of his head and kill him?
[26:31.04]Okay, I'm going to jump down and try to jump on his head.
[26:34.22]And then I don't have to use any ammo.
[26:39.52]Get up.
[26:42.00]Watch me, dude.
[26:42.54]These are like everybody.
[26:43.46]Alright, here we go.
[26:43.90]I've got to line this up.
[26:45.82]Make sure this is correct.
[26:55.24]Fuck it.
[26:55.64]Let's go.
[26:59.14]He didn't have anything.
[27:04.18]Where's my horse?
[27:04.88]I'm going to save the shotgun.
[27:07.92]I don't want to waste too much ammo.
[27:10.04]That guy's got an ammo belt, actually.
[27:15.30]Okay, I like that.
[27:16.88]I like being able to... Just get close.
[27:23.56]Perfect.
[27:24.66]No.
[27:25.42]Stop it.
[27:31.11]Shotgun ammo.
[27:31.77]They have like one or two shots each.
[27:33.59]Where did you even come from?
[27:37.69]Well, that was easy enough.
[27:38.55]Let's go.
[27:46.81]Oh yeah, I got like more Deadeye, right?
[27:48.55]That's what it said.
[27:53.52]I'll have to use that more often.
[27:57.63]Burn the coffin.
[27:58.99]Sure thing.
[28:00.57]New items, that's cool.
[28:02.33]They could have just easily had not given you something cool like this.
[28:06.53]Burn the coffin.
[28:12.93]For a better force.
[28:16.41]I can do that.
[28:17.65]He's got an ammo belt.
[28:18.97]Burn the remaining coffins.
[28:20.18]Easy.
[28:20.44]Uh...
[28:25.40]Right in the head.
[28:29.16]Oh, God.
[28:29.66]Here comes Deadeye.
[28:32.38]Well, let's do it.
[28:41.05]That's fun.
[28:41.61]That's going to be a lot of fun with a ton of zombies.
[28:46.27]Is there any other high magazine weapons that I can get?
[28:55.20]That would be cool.
[28:56.92]Taking on hordes of zombies with Deadeye.
[28:59.42]Alright, let's just go burn the remaining.
[29:00.67]I don't think we can do that.
[29:01.83]Let's just train them over here.
[29:08.19]Come over here, guys.
[29:10.92]Okay.
[29:12.64]Get up.
[29:12.90]It's a rock.
[29:13.50]I know there's a rock.
[29:14.30]What the fuck was that?
[29:24.42]Okay, well, we did it.
[29:27.22]We're doing okay here.
[29:28.80]We're doing alright.
[29:33.34]Oh shit, a huge fat guy.
[29:40.64]You don't have to aim to kill Mordecai and the rest of the horde.
[29:44.02]Oh god, okay.
[29:47.47]I kinda like this more than the other game.
[29:57.17]Did I... I won.
[30:03.29]Okay, well that was it.
[30:05.28]They apparently walked out with dog collars on, like shock collars, and died.
[30:09.32]All their heads came off.
[30:14.54]Okay, well thanks for the fun time.
[30:20.21]All their heads came off.
[30:23.23]Why?
[30:23.75]Why?
[30:27.13]Sorry, somebody just called me a moron.
[30:30.33]What?
[30:32.85]What happened?
[30:36.36]Why am I an idiot?
[30:37.68]The quest reset?
[30:42.90]Okay.
[30:46.58]Alright.
[30:49.36]Well, we're just gonna go do this.
[30:50.88]I guess I can't walk ten feet away from the graveyard.
[30:59.22]Somebody just called me a moron.
[31:01.72]Here comes Mordecai.
[31:05.00]Band of thieves.
[31:09.56]That's never happened before.
[31:10.52]It's never been, oh, you walk too far away, the mission failed.
[31:15.07]What?
[31:23.13]Now clear the graveyard.
[31:26.07]Gladly.
[31:32.79]neck shot.
[31:33.29]I don't think I got it.
[31:39.85]It's all good.
[31:42.37]Who's left?
[31:44.75]Oh, this is going to be good.
[31:48.05]No, it's not.
[31:53.60]Ah, what?
[31:56.38]Last one, and then I believe one of the guys is going to throw his ugly face somewhere.
[32:07.46]Mordecai Robert.
[32:09.34]Sorely missed.
[32:12.37]Holy shit, he's a charger.
[32:19.71]Okay.
[32:28.54]He's not dead.
[32:31.50]I'm gonna shoot him, like, a couple times in the head, I think.
[32:36.98]Shit.
[32:39.20]What you got on you, Mordecai?
[32:40.48]Nothing?
[32:41.12]You're in a grapple.
[32:48.29]What did that just say?
[32:55.75]You shoot them normally.
[32:57.57]Don't you take their heads off?
[33:02.67]Should I be burning these corpses?
[33:06.44]You've acquired a new weapon which can be equipped using the weapon select menu holding the left bumper.
[33:12.07]Yeah?
[33:13.73]Oh, it's just talking about that?
[33:15.11]Okay.
[33:22.43]Press Y during grapple to get an execution.
[33:24.21]Just use the torch on him.
[33:26.57]That is true.
[33:29.71]Anybody else?
[33:31.91]This guy over here.
[33:34.27]And you.
[33:34.61]Oh, should I check inside the houses?
[33:42.18]Check the houses.
[33:44.30]Nah.
[33:48.70]Back to Blackwater.
[33:53.07]Good job.
[34:06.23]Town is under attack.
[34:07.05]In order to sleep here and more easily explore, you'll need to assist people.
[34:12.90]You can find ammo in any remaining chest in town by looting some undead.
[34:16.06]Why are they shooting me?
[34:22.88]Town safety.
[34:23.70]Do I gotta like help the town?
[34:27.86]Okay.
[34:34.18]That's cool.
[34:35.40]So this is like reverse liberation.
[34:41.80]Is he going to get on the horse?
[34:45.46]Oh shit.
[34:48.17]I thought he was going to get on the horse and ride away.
[34:54.85]Alright, come on.
[34:55.37]Town safety.
[34:55.97]Plus five.
[35:03.73]sniper rifle ammo.
[35:09.56]This is great, I love this.
[35:18.91]Any more people over here?
[35:20.05]Come down.
[35:42.28]Go get the chest?
[35:43.00]I know, I'm like helping the town first.
[35:44.78]I was gonna get it after.
[35:45.68]Do I like, I have to go get this chest?
[35:53.13]I thought I was like, why can't I just do this first?
[36:02.47]I mean like, I could just go get this, but can't I just do this after?
[36:13.97]Oh, here it is.
[36:15.11]In this room somewhere.
[36:25.12]Chest.
[36:29.38]Sniper rifle ammo.
[36:30.26]Times 30.
[36:30.54]30 times.
[36:31.82]Lots of shotgun ammo.
[36:35.62]Evolver of God bag.
[36:37.00]Couldn't I...
[36:38.99]Couldn't I have just done that?
[36:40.87]After saving the town?
[36:45.13]Nothing in here?
[36:50.53]Nothing in the bank vault.
[36:51.31]Alright, let's just go back out there.
[37:00.92]Alright.
[37:01.58]I gotta kill like one more zombie.
[37:02.88]No.
[37:03.80]This zombie.
[37:11.30]There it is.
[37:14.64]They're remaining undead.
[37:15.78]Okay, let me just train them all to me.
[37:18.77]And then use my red Deadeye.
[37:22.95]Come on.
[37:24.83]Come on now.
[37:26.27]There we go.
[37:27.43]Thank you.
[37:27.93]And one.
[37:29.85]Two.
[37:29.99]Two.
[37:48.32]There it is!
[37:49.18]Give it to me!
[37:52.52]Beautiful.
[37:57.43]Wrecked.
[38:00.03]Okay, so this town is marked with a cross.
[38:11.54]I actually got the... I got the full team wipe with... That was fun.
[38:16.68]Okay.
[38:20.58]Time to save.
[38:21.27]You can sleep in the bed in your room to save your game.
[38:22.81]If you sleep, you would wake up, I guess, six hours later.
[38:24.51]That's true.
[38:25.03]Alright, so what about, like, supplies?
[38:26.45]Didn't it say they needed something?
[38:36.13]Can I sell them this ship?
[38:41.80]Nice video game reference, I know, right?
[38:43.46]Um... Oh, here they are.
[38:53.19]No shops.
[38:53.85]Just pull the trigger in dead-eye?
[38:56.71]That's true.
[38:57.21]But then it's not as fun to see, like, that bang bang bang bang bang.
[39:10.95]What's going on?
[39:12.03]It's the government's fault.
[39:14.33]Ain't it always?
[39:15.01]Well, they let in too many foreigners.
[39:17.14]Just shut the goddamn border or things like this happen.
[39:21.08]My daughter was just some Satanic demon's lunch because of the goddamn government.
[39:27.02]And I pay my taxes.
[39:28.36]Well, here we go.
[39:29.10]Usually.
[39:29.54]I think we may be moving a little off topic here.
[39:33.21]I ain't a wise man, but I have done a little traveling.
[39:36.45]These creatures ain't like any foreigners I've ever seen.
[39:39.06]Thanks for the input, cowpoke.
[39:42.04]I got flesh-eating monsters feasting on my family.
[39:44.98]We need to build a wall.
[39:46.08]What in the world has my life come to?
[39:50.74]And my daddy told me I never should have gotten married.
[39:53.54]This is all your fault, you useless man.
[39:56.87]Fucking relevant politics.
[39:59.35]Not this again.
[40:02.19]You thought he was a bully, and he was a drunk.
[40:04.33]Oh, that's stupid.
[40:07.70]Listen, I'm sorry to interrupt your happy reminiscence.
[40:11.18]Is there anything I can do to help you?
[40:13.36]Why is he drunk?
[40:15.90]You could try shooting them creatures, you dumb fool.
[40:20.76]Ma'am, it's been a real pleasure.
[40:23.78]Sir, you're a man of great patience.
[40:30.96]Search for more survivors.
[40:32.04]Oh no, there's two Trumps.

[41:16.60]Grover Cleveland.
[41:17.36]Okay, well, there's no survivor in there.
[41:23.53]I just heard somebody screaming.
[41:29.01]These ones are boarded up.
[41:29.77]I'm assuming that means they can't be opened.
[41:34.13]That's not a door.
[41:34.85]That's a window.
[41:39.94]uh okay missed the chest I didn't miss the chest actually excuse me I ran by the chest hey you one of them mister do I look like one of them don't come no closer we made that mistake before these are survivors right I ain't one of them you fool well how do I know

[42:11.67]Have it your way, alright?
[42:12.93]Listen.
[42:14.54]I ain't coming no closer.
[42:17.15]You know what's going on?
[42:18.85]It's the glass eye.
[42:20.33]The freak with the glass eye.
[42:21.79]He caused this.
[42:23.15]No, no, no.
[42:23.67]It's the snake oil man.
[42:25.46]These poor folks have been drugged.
[42:26.82]I blame the Mexicans.
[42:28.16]They haven't been struck down.
[42:29.82]We heard a lot of stories, mister.
[42:31.78]Some say it's a moon.
[42:33.24]Some say it's drugs.
[42:34.22]Hey, don't come no closer now.
[42:35.58]Stand back.
[42:38.06]Apparently it's worse in New Austin.
[42:40.12]Must be where it came from.
[42:41.12]It looks like I'm headed down to New Austin.
[42:44.02]Did one of you say snake oil?
[42:46.06]It's the glass eye.
[42:47.14]I blame the Mexicans.
[42:48.82]Oh, Connie McTavish, you don't know nothing.
[42:51.70]You always was an ignorant shrew.
[42:53.62]I bet your husband's glad he's dead.
[42:57.34]Well, at least my husband never took favors from the stargazers, Lucille Billingsgate.
[43:04.13]You say you're sorry you killed Billy White.
[43:08.19]Is that better?
[43:29.57]We never had that decided.
[43:31.14]We decided we would hold elections and that I would be leader.
[43:34.06]You can't even read.
[43:35.16]Well, I got gravity.
[43:37.64]I mean, gravy.
[43:39.88]I mean, folk respect me.
[43:42.36]I am the new king, Archibald Andrews.
[43:44.67]Speak up.
[43:45.13]No.
[43:48.65]Why is Trump 10 feet away from the microphone?
[43:54.43]Well, there's one person dead.
[43:57.61]He's got...
[44:01.94]Track down Nigel West Dickens and Seth in New Austin.
[44:06.98]With pleasure.
[44:08.11]Well, that one's a runner.
[44:09.11]That one runs.
[44:09.69]This one looks like Michael Jackson.
[44:19.77]And I'm having a little trouble, so...
[44:26.66]Okay.
[44:27.32]There she is.
[44:28.86]Alright.
[44:29.68]Her head's not gone.
[44:32.36]Now it is.
[44:36.03]I don't know.
[44:40.71]I can still do the warhorse, right?
[44:41.85]Yeah.
[44:46.65]Wasting ammo.
[44:47.45]I know.
[44:47.65]It was bad.
[44:55.09]Hey look, there's the original horse that I had.
[44:57.85]Cool.
[45:03.93]Move!
[45:09.23]There's a lot of cool horses in the DLC, really.
[45:13.18]There are better horses in the DLC.
[45:16.04]There's a flaming horse, are you sure?
[45:18.04]Wow.
[45:18.88]That's pretty cool.
[45:22.58]Is it a unicorn?
[45:24.54]Where do you find them?
[45:31.21]Check and see if towns are in need of your help with the pause menu.
[45:35.43]Birth of the Conservation Movement.
[45:40.42]Dinner for two.
[45:43.38]Um... Undead Nightmare, Undead Nightmare.
[45:47.10]I think it's just two different ones.
[45:48.22]Well, let's...
[45:51.78]Let's just go over here.
[45:52.70]Right?
[45:53.90]Let's just see where this one is.
[45:56.88]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[46:01.28]Is that a zombie and a horse?
[46:03.04]Oh, they're still just random townspeople?
[46:05.58]Okay.
[46:05.70]Okay.
[46:05.82]I mean, if we're going to do it with the DLC, we might as well do it.
[46:22.18]What are you guys talking about?
[46:23.00]There are like monsters?
[46:27.36]Whoa.
[46:31.75]Is that a regular dog or is that a zombie dog?
[46:35.47]I can't tell.
[46:37.85]That was a zombie dog.
[46:38.73]Okay.
[46:39.29]I don't... I don't think I need to skin... Who wants to eat zombie dogs?
[46:47.98]I don't think I want to do that.
[46:49.40]I'm just curious.
[46:50.02]Let's see what happens.
[46:52.86]Do you get, like, zombie dog meat?
[46:59.10]Undead wolf teeth.
[47:01.65]Interesting.
[47:02.23]Okay.
[47:06.95]Uh, I'm running out of ammo.
[47:08.21]I gotta be careful here.
[47:09.17]Wait.
[47:16.39]Wait, what are you... Really?
[47:20.87]Is that for real?
[47:25.84]Really?
[47:27.22]Are you guys fucking with me right now?
[47:38.50]The animal's come back to life!
[47:40.04]Undead!
[47:40.44]He's gonna become an undead horse!
[47:43.75]Just like the warlock in World of Warcraft!
[47:53.80]Did I just make a fu- Did I just- Did I just make a mistake?
[47:57.10]I just made a mistake, didn't I?
[48:06.73]Everyone's calling me an idiot.
[48:10.35]I'm stupid, I'm stupid, I'm stupid.
[48:11.71]Are you serious?
[48:17.15]Somebody said that if you get like that, your horse can become undead.
[48:24.81]Oh, please.
[48:26.09]See?
[48:27.07]Here comes the horse.
[48:34.02]And look at that!
[48:35.36]And look at this!
[48:39.68]Your whistle has attracted an undead steed, has increased stamina and health, and it fu- I- and everybody called me a fucking idiot.
[48:48.66]Everybody called me a fucking moron.
[48:52.95]This thing is now an undead horse.
[48:55.31]And I'm an idiot, apparently.
[48:56.85]Stupid, dumb, shithead streamer makes mistake on stream.
[49:05.54]I'm actually surprised that... What the fuck is that?
[49:09.13]What is that?
[49:09.85]Oh, zombies.
[49:15.94]This thing is, like, pretty fast.
[49:17.76]This thing is actually kind of hard to control, though.
[49:20.50]Sometimes when I press the button, he doesn't do it.
[49:23.48]He's actually running kind of fucking awkwardly.
[49:27.74]Yeah, I don't know if I like this.
[49:30.98]He's impossible to control.
[49:32.92]I'm not doing that, he is.
[49:36.36]This is like driving a car with the front in alignment.
[49:39.41]That is all fucked up.
[49:40.57]You ever drive a car like that?
[49:44.73]He doesn't listen to your commands sometimes.
[49:46.61]Oh, right.
[49:48.57]Well, good.
[49:50.77]Just like me.
[49:54.23]What is in here?
[49:54.99]Can I hitch him?
[49:55.97]I want to keep him.
[49:56.97]Oh, there's another one.
[49:57.73]Wait, there's another horse with no head.
[50:01.02]I got one, mister.
[50:02.00]Hey, I got one.
[50:03.88]Got what, mister?
[50:05.18]The damn Sasquatch.
[50:06.46]The filthy thing was going to eat my dog when this girl hollered out, and I shot the thing right through
[50:12.46]That's the price for infinite stamina.
[50:13.92]That's true.
[50:14.38]You feeling alright, mister?
[50:16.68]I've seen a lot of strange things recently, but no Sasquatch running around here.
[50:21.60]Nor no place else.
[50:23.32]They're made up.
[50:25.94]One person said I get a zombie horse.
[50:27.98]Might as well.
[50:28.68]It was real.
[50:29.46]It worked.
[50:30.90]Come on.
[50:33.06]They ain't a little girl.
[50:35.48]Are you serious?
[50:37.08]Do I look like I'm joking?
[50:39.77]The hills are infested with them.
[50:42.92]This guy like seeing things Bigfoot Kill six Sasquatches
[51:11.12]I actually have to kill Sasquatches?
[51:16.06]Do I get, like, an area here?
[51:18.32]Up in... Oh, it's up there.
[51:23.59]Status unknown, status unknown, status unknown.
[51:32.47]Well... Okay.
[51:37.55]Am I gonna get my ass kicked here?
[51:48.60]The Sasquatches are invisible.
[51:50.07]Alright, so it's an undead horse, which means I can't die, right?
[51:52.45]So if I take him down here, he's... Not gonna fucking happen to me again.
[51:58.15]This shit happened to me already.
[52:03.07]That's not happening again with an undead fucking bear.
[52:05.21]I'm sorry.
[52:05.65]Like, I went to go with the same bear from the fucking original game, right?
[52:11.55]The same place, this time he's dead.
[52:13.85]Not happening a second time.
[52:21.38]This is the return of the fucking bear.
[52:23.14]This time, he's dead.
[52:24.78]And it was the same exact circums... What the fuck?!
[52:33.88]Okay, he's... He's alive.
[52:36.24]It's two bears.
[52:37.30]It's the same two bears from the original game.
[52:39.32]The same exact scenario.
[52:43.83]No way.
[52:48.09]Like, I have to let this happen, right?
[52:50.83]I don't think he can even hurt me.
[52:56.87]He can't hurt my horse.
[53:01.91]Well, I get the last laugh.
[53:03.91]I get my own epilogue.
[53:08.21]I killed your brother, and now I'm gonna kill you.
[53:10.59]No, no I'm not.
[53:16.59]Yes, I am.
[53:19.57]I put a cap on it.
[53:20.39]I completed the paradox.
[53:24.75]That's fucking unbelievable.
[53:26.21]That's like the exact same scenario.
[53:27.93]Oh, can I fall down this?
[53:29.54]Am I gonna die?
[53:32.14]That's how you summon the... Guys, summon those two bears.
[53:34.56]That's how you do it.
[53:36.06]Walk on that edge with a horse and ask if you're gonna die from the fall.
[53:40.16]I got my revenge.
[53:49.38]Alright, looking for sa- Another bear.
[53:53.35]Well, it's okay.
[53:56.27]And like, there's so many zombie animals.
[54:00.53]Okay, I can look at a Sasquatch.
[54:02.43]Something tells me I should have the other gun out for this.
[54:05.27]Get- Need to kill so- Oh god, it really is Sasquatch.
[54:17.02]Are you serious?
[54:20.54]That's all he wanted to do.
[54:21.36]He didn't care about me.
[54:25.57]Fuck out of here.
[54:27.11]Give me a break.
[54:29.33]My undead horse.
[54:30.15]Well, I want another one.
[54:31.97]Now he's double dead.
[54:33.23]He's died twice.
[54:35.79]Where'd he go?
[54:45.75]Where did that guy go?
[54:46.71]I'm actually kind of scared, though.
[54:47.95]Where did that fucking Sasquatch go?
[54:50.44]He was, like, hulking in the trees over here.
[54:53.64]I don't have a horse to be, like, safe.
[55:09.61]And the music, too.
[55:13.91]What is that noise?
[55:19.57]Somebody help me.
[55:22.41]Somebody help me.
[55:24.43]What is it?
[55:24.73]What is it?
[55:25.35]What do you need?
[55:25.71]What is it?
[55:26.99]What is it?
[55:27.36]What are you doing?
[55:29.68]Somebody help me.
[55:31.16]You're a blip on my radar, but I can't do anything.
[55:38.04]What am I helping?
[55:38.66]What are we doing?
[55:40.58]What are we running from?
[55:49.85]DayZ.
[55:52.01]Somebody just ran by me and trained these zombies to me in DayZ.
[55:55.69]Thanks.
[55:56.81]Appreciate it.
[55:59.13]I don't have any bullets in this.
[56:00.09]No.
[56:01.39]This lady's kind of on her own.
[56:03.69]I'm sorry, lady.
[56:04.47]It's alright.
[56:11.94]They're just cracking her back.
[56:13.18]She's gonna be okay.
[56:15.35]Oh no, there she goes!
[56:18.07]There's not much time!
[56:23.71]Get the fuck outta here!
[56:26.66]No, I refuse to die.
[56:28.28]I refuse.
[56:28.90]There's a fucking wild cat over here.
[56:41.29]I can't fucking die here.
[56:51.87]Where is he?
[56:53.85]Where's that fucking cat?
[56:54.95]Where is he?
[56:55.33]I don't know where he is.
[57:00.94]Where is he?
[57:03.04]I'm like fearing him.
[57:04.40]I can fear him.
[57:06.98]And where are the Sasquatches?
[57:08.36]Okay, I'm good for now.
[57:16.80]A lot of shocking.
[57:17.68]There's one.
[57:19.54]Okay, what do I do here?
[57:23.38]Are they just like everybody else?
[57:28.40]They're just bigger.
[57:34.84]Oh, I haven't... Oh, he's running.
[57:36.20]He's actually running away from me.
[57:39.42]He's like, oh shit!
[57:40.97]This guy's scary!
[57:42.89]Get away from me!
[57:43.85]I don't want to be found!
[57:45.47]You're going to put me on Unsolved Mysteries!
[57:48.11]I don't want to be on that show!
[57:49.39]That show sucks!
[57:51.77]Come here.
[57:58.73]He actually says that.
[58:03.55]I was making a shitty joke.
[58:07.36]I can't grab him?
[58:12.06]Can I, like, ride him?
[58:17.28]Does he have anything else to say?
[58:22.03]Fight back, Sion!
[58:24.69]Okay, well, he's like... Alright, well, sorry.
[58:31.25]This has to come to an end now.
[58:41.92]Six years in the making.
[58:44.93]Get away from me!
[58:45.77]I'm scared of you!
[58:47.65]How many times have you guys heard me do that?
[58:49.50]Like, big scary person running away, but is actually scared, but they shouldn't be.
[58:56.46]And that was the real.
[58:58.00]That was actually part of the game.
[58:59.88]I'm surprised by that.
[59:00.66]Okay, well, I got my horse back.
[59:13.59]Five more Sasquatches.
[59:19.45]Okay, what is it?
[59:21.09]I gotta get rid of this stupid cat.
[59:23.57]This thing's gotta go.
[59:24.51]This isn't gonna cause me problems, I know it.
[59:28.15]Got a shot!
[59:37.81]I shot the fucking horse in the back of the head.
[59:44.10]Fuck off.
[59:55.78]What the fuck is going on here?
[59:59.12]Why is it... Is this the new bear?
[60:01.38]Fucking get the fuck out of here.
[60:03.98]He's unkillable.
[60:13.00]This cat is unkillable.
[60:21.12]What is this?
[60:21.52]Oh, this guy needs help.
[60:25.73]You need a lot of help.
[60:26.81]Oh, dear.
[60:30.39]I don't know what to do here.
[60:38.82]There's too many.
[60:39.72]There's too many.
[60:40.58]Like what?
[60:42.50]Try to be a fucking good person and it gets you killed.
[60:47.98]Fuck those people.
[60:51.06]I didn't want to accidentally fucking shoot one of those guys in the head.
[60:53.52]And I would have.
[61:00.55]Repeater?
[61:02.17]I mean like... Now I got like fucking bunny rabbits chasing me too.
[61:10.87]Oh, God.
[61:13.35]Get out of here, you fucking little skunk.
[61:18.53]Here comes a bear.
[61:20.61]Why are there so many fucking animals?
[61:23.15]Why is this just the animal DLC?
[61:27.02]It's just the scary undead animal DLC.
[61:31.10]Oh, look, there's the bear.
[61:32.04]Oh.
[61:41.25]They're just fucking everywhere.
[61:42.35]These are like the little velociraptors from the movie.
[61:50.68]This is just Zombie Cowboy Far Cry 3.
[61:52.86]Okay, I gotta get back up to the... up here.
[62:03.54]This is fun though.
[62:04.84]I like this.
[62:06.34]I feel like I'm in a lot more danger than I was in the main game.
[62:15.12]The Jurassic Park movie.
[62:20.38]Let's go, let's move.
[62:25.96]Mmm, another Sasquatch.
[62:28.58]We're gonna kill five, right?
[62:39.15]Giddyup!
[62:42.11]Another bear.
[62:44.57]They added a bunch more animals to the open world.
[62:48.53]Please, I am here.
[62:49.27]Help me.
[62:58.52]You need a doctor.
[63:00.92]Well, you very clearly need a doctor because you don't have a head.
[63:05.70]Okay.
[63:11.70]This fucking mannequin.
[63:18.29]Did I get her?
[63:19.35]Did I get her in the head?
[63:22.21]Apparently.
[63:25.37]Oh doctor, I don't feel good.
[63:28.62]Somebody removed my head and now I have green fucking Nickelodeon slime coming out of my neck.
[63:36.62]This is fucking crazy.
[63:41.04]Not a moment has gone by in this DLC where something odd or outrageous has happened.
[63:49.68]This is cool, I like this.
[63:51.44]I like how all over the place this is.
[63:57.86]Oh no, leave me alone!
[63:58.75]This is my house!
[63:59.65]I'm so scared!
[64:01.77]This is actually really in the game!
[64:05.03]Usually it's a shitty joke the Jerma does when like a big guy runs away, but like please, this is real this time!
[64:09.48]It's for real!
[64:20.63]Is he actually going to get killed by the cat?
[64:24.21]Will the cat go after him?
[64:25.25]Honestly, fucking god, I hate these bobcats.
[64:35.70]I hate these bobcats.
[64:36.80]They're so fast and they're so hard to deal with.
[64:38.74]Oh my god, how did I do that?
[64:45.30]How did I miss?
[64:53.94]Die!
[65:01.04]Don't run off the edge, please.
[65:02.64]Give me the Bigfoot shit.
[65:06.54]What do you got?
[65:07.60]Ammo?
[65:08.60]No.
[65:08.66]It'd be so funny if he had, like, shotgun ammo.
[65:14.24]There's one right behind me here.
[65:21.45]Let's make this quick.
[65:24.31]Ooh.
[65:27.31]Okay. Almost was a disaster, but we're good.
[65:36.31]Were they lighting off like fireworks somewhere down here.
[65:40.31]There is sasquatch right there.
[65:43.31]Let's just make this real quick. You're not even gonna know he's dead.
[65:53.39]See, that's more humane, right?
[65:54.52]Like, he didn't even know he was dead.
[65:57.76]And you're not supposed to scare the... Another fucking bear.
[66:01.87]And this one just came out of nowhere.
[66:03.25]For no reason.
[66:33.75]Where was the... Where was that bear?
[66:39.11]I didn't fail it.
[66:39.93]Okay.
[66:43.61]Animal nightmare.
[66:48.69]This is hard.
[66:53.81]That was... I'm okay with that.
[66:55.87]Except I'm not.
[66:57.84]At all.
[66:58.14]Unbelievable bullshit.
[67:00.86]Where's my horse?
[67:05.19]The horse wasn't able to find you.
[67:06.31]I'm at my house.
[67:11.31]If I started that all the way over, if I have to kill six Sasquatches again, I'm just going to go to the mission.
[67:17.71]There is my horse.
[67:19.87]Look at this horse.
[67:24.45]Alright, I got the shotgun now.
[67:28.95]Put on the pajamas.
[67:30.95]Alright, next time I'm able to.
[67:32.48]Where's my war horse?
[67:37.27]You can just... You get out of here.
[67:38.68]I want my warhorse.
[67:43.88]You just go off somewhere.
[67:44.86]Go get attacked by a fucking bear.
[67:46.16]There's plenty of those over there.
[67:56.99]Let's move.
[68:02.11]Three more Sasquatches.
[68:05.26]And then we ride.
[68:09.41]Sooner or later, we'll ride.
[68:17.74]Your dragons will ride.
[68:27.26]I have to do that every like, at least like once a, like every six months.
[68:31.81]I have to do Jorah more.
[68:33.93]I have to.
[68:35.57]Don't, please, don't do this to me.
[68:44.40]What, what was that?
[68:51.47]What is shooting a machine gun?
[69:01.06]Okay.
[69:05.37]What is that?
[69:05.81]What is going on?
[69:14.38]Is that my horse making that noise?
[69:17.98]Where is this machine gun fire?
[69:32.27]I need to, like, hear that again.
[69:33.25]Oh, fucking whatever.
[69:39.71]It was just my horse.
[69:48.80]I'm gonna go across the river.
[69:49.72]That's gonna be fucking beautiful.
[70:01.68]Streamer gets distracted and Wanda's run slow.
[70:03.58]I'm just taking it in.
[70:04.40]Everybody wants to go so fast these days.
[70:09.78]What happened to the old days?
[70:10.80]When you could just kind of walk around and look at stuff.
[70:15.51]Everyone wants to go so fast, so hard.
[70:17.45]Complete, complete, complete.
[70:18.53]Fast as possible.
[70:19.31]As good as possible.
[70:20.13]What happened to the old days?
[70:21.05]Remember the old days?
[70:26.11]When you could go like this?
[70:27.51]Remember those days.
[70:37.85]I remember those days.
[70:38.57]Remember Moon Shoes?
[70:55.78]Where is he?
[70:58.90]There he is.
[71:00.18]He's gonna fall.
[71:01.48]He's gonna fall down and we're all gonna laugh at him.
[71:05.63]Go on.
[71:18.74]I want to shoot him in the leg.
[71:19.82]Can I capture these?
[71:21.08]Or do I have to kill them?
[71:23.74]Oh, well.
[71:29.36]Is he good?
[71:30.22]No, it's not going to do anything.
[71:35.05]Well, I don't... Forget his pelt.
[71:41.09]I figured maybe you could talk to them or something.
[71:46.21]Can I ride the wave down here?
[71:47.57]Please ride the wave.
[71:51.48]Very slowly.
[71:52.22]I can still skin him, I think.
[71:55.10]Yeah, I can.
[71:56.60]He's right there.
[72:02.21]Both legs.
[72:10.25]Come down here with me.
[72:15.73]Nice and easy.
[72:16.43]And we're good.
[72:23.43]No, there he is.
[72:24.33]Okay.
[72:25.39]He was close.
[72:35.48]Kill one more Sasquatch in tall trees.
[72:41.90]So, does nobody have money in this game?
[72:47.62]I'm just not sure how it works.
[72:51.58]You can lasso them?
[72:53.84]Wasn't I trying to do that and it didn't work?
[72:54.96]I feel like I tried to do that a few times.
[72:57.72]Oh, here comes the last... And he's like sentient too.
[73:05.28]He's gonna... Yeah, this is gonna be great.
[73:06.79]This is freaking me out.

[75:14.97]You know what I mean?
[75:15.61]Like, I feel so bad about this.
[75:23.93]Can I give him, like, a peace offering here?
[75:26.94]I'll teach you how to make fire.
[75:30.32]What you do is you get lighter fluid and you put it all over this and you get a lighter and you light it.
[75:33.62]That's how you make fire.
[75:39.58]Nah, we're gonna... We're gonna let him live.
[75:41.70]We're gonna let him live.
[75:44.79]That doesn't mean he ain't coming with me, though.
[75:57.60]What?
[76:02.35]Mythical creature has appeared in the area.
[76:06.53]Who cares?
[76:07.72]Who cares about you?
[76:09.86]The mythical creature's in the area.
[76:15.82]What a majestic creature.

[76:38.57]This is like poisoning me.
[76:47.19]Wow, what pestilence, huh?
[76:49.69]This is like the four horsemen?
[76:53.26]That's cool.
[76:55.92]So is there war?
[76:58.02]Oh no, is this famine or war?
[77:01.68]I mean, no, you know what I mean.
[77:03.24]Like, are they all in the game?
[77:06.44]Is this gonna kill me while I stay on this?
[77:08.66]This is going to, isn't it?
[77:16.25]Got him.
[77:18.53]Four horses of the apocalypse, rank one.
[77:21.81]War, pestilence, famine, and death.
[77:23.05]Which one is this?
[77:23.77]Is this famine?
[77:24.43]Is this pestilence?
[77:26.01]I'm assuming this is pestilence.
[77:29.51]Okay, I've broken a horse of the apocalypse.
[77:34.01]Pestilence is almost impossible to kill.
[77:40.89]Okay.
[77:47.24]Alright, I gotta safely get back to a hitching post.
[77:52.68]So Pestilence can't die.
[77:57.41]We're gonna have to put this to the test.
[77:59.19]Challenge accepted.
[78:00.19]Pestilence cannot be killed.
[78:16.46]No.
[78:17.18]Ain't happening.
[78:28.75]You guys think I'm gonna actually fucking do that?
[78:31.57]Get outta here.
[78:37.02]Uh, what is this?
[78:38.04]Status unknown.
[78:38.92]I wanna know what that is.
[78:44.13]I can't put a waypoint next to it?
[78:50.10]Well, we're just gonna go to the left then.
[78:52.74]Status unknown.
[79:03.08]Save the game, save the game!
[79:04.32]Everyone calm down!
[79:06.00]Jesus Christ!
[79:11.77]Holy shit!
[79:17.25]Don't all fucking scream at once!
[79:18.73]I can't save the game right now.
[79:34.80]There's no campfire.
[79:41.40]I have to go to a house to sleep to save.
[79:49.91]Even if you did kill it, you get to summon another one.
[79:52.23]Okay, well, whatever.
[79:56.18]Hey, before, before, hey, all you guys that are misinformed about saving the game, I can't save the game right now.
[80:05.44]Everyone's like fucking screaming at the top of their lungs.
[80:07.56]I can't save the game.
[80:08.64]Sweet mother of mercy!
[80:13.53]This town is under attack.
[80:14.57]Alright, let's just, I'll get a, I'll get a save point right here.
[80:21.81]We'll get a point right at it.
[80:22.65]We'll get a save point.
[80:28.13]You're not gonna be able to kill my horse.
[80:29.31]I already know that.
[80:34.09]Run this way.
[80:35.07]Do the repeater.
[80:49.37]Pestilence helping me right now?
[80:51.05]I would appreciate it actually.
[80:56.55]Pestilence is fucking doing work.
[81:01.71]Kills remaining undead.
[81:02.64]Holy shit, there's so many.
[81:04.42]There are so many.
[81:06.36]This is fucking awful.
[81:07.70]There are so many.
[81:23.40]Watch it.
[81:24.86]Watch it.
[81:26.42]Watch it.
[81:28.22]TNT right there, but I don't want to blow the horse up.
[81:32.92]Get out of there.
[81:33.61]Come here.
[81:34.97]Come here.
[81:35.27]Over here.
[81:35.53]Now.
[81:37.61]Well, you're not going to come over here, are you?
[81:42.05]God damn it.
[81:57.19]We're good.
[82:00.11]Nice job, Pestilence.
[82:04.60]You might be rewarded with a weapon you don't currently possess.
[82:07.36]Interesting.
[82:11.54]Horse can't die.
[82:13.18]Horse can die.
[82:14.20]If I blow it up with dynamite.
[82:19.86]It didn't say it was impossible to kill.
[82:21.30]It said it's hard to kill.
[82:30.85]What's with this backseat saving I'm seeing in the chat right now?
[82:33.73]Alright, let's go get the chest.
[82:52.07]Dude, just because the night elves are immortal doesn't mean you don't blow them up with dynamite.
[82:55.89]They ain't coming back.
[83:00.58]Just because a vampire is immortal doesn't mean you stick a fucking stake in his heart and he don't die.
[83:08.16]Come on, guys.
[83:08.74]Don't you guys know the rules?
[83:15.06]What is it?
[83:16.50]New weapon?
[83:22.24]Sniper rifle ammo times zero.
[83:24.01]Okay.
[83:28.83]Uh bolt action rifle repeater bolt action rifle cool Let's give it a try So it's just a one shot Hey, look I can save the game and I can hitch the horse everybody calm down Everybody chill out we don't have to fucking burn the house down.
[83:52.57]Where's a hitching post?
[83:59.27]I got a new outfit, too.
[84:01.55]Where can I hitch the horse?
[84:02.41]I don't see a post.
[84:14.70]Still burn the house down.
[84:15.70]I don't think there is a hitching post here.
[84:17.00]Is there?
[84:21.77]Go into the fire.
[84:26.07]Alright, we'll get out of here.
[84:33.17]Let's change outfits.
[84:35.27]Poncho.
[84:36.23]Duster coat.
[84:37.63]Rancher clothing.
[84:38.89]Undead hunter.
[84:40.35]Undiscovered.
[84:42.07]Union suit.
[84:43.31]Oh, there's the underwear.
[84:44.11]Okay.
[84:51.36]Doing no save run.
[85:01.97]Save the game.
[85:06.57]Okay.
[85:14.99]Where's my buddy?
[85:18.49]Where's Pestilence?
[85:20.48]He can't find me.
[85:21.14]Okay.
[85:23.06]There's a person here.
[85:24.64]I believe.
[85:28.70]No save run.
[85:29.84]Oh, I would rather fucking pee blood than not save the game.
[85:37.57]Wasn't there somebody up here?
[85:44.73]The union suit is that funny outfit all the hip and popular YouTubers play when they play this.
[85:49.71]I told you that I'm late to the party here, so all these awful fucking... Look, I'm in my underwear.
[85:56.55]I told you that was going to happen.
[85:57.90]I have to live up to the funny YouTuber streamer name, right?
[86:03.36]Where's this guy?
[86:04.90]Wasn't somebody shooting?
[86:22.50]Um, I don't know where the fuck this guy is.
[86:24.84]Nope.
[86:30.74]Nope, okay.
[86:38.64]Well, it was fun while it lasted.
[86:48.75]Hey, pestilence, come here.
[86:59.30]Whoo-hoo Save alright enough with the save bullshit if I see save again We're gonna have a problem.
[87:09.03]We're gonna have a big problem.
[87:12.79]Oh There is He's even right over here
[87:31.24]Save before you leave.
[87:32.40]Oh, there he is.
[87:36.57]Can I do something with this guy?
[87:39.73]There's no talk.
[87:41.85]Oh, okay.
[87:48.90]That's cool.
[87:50.08]So there's a guy here.
[87:54.22]Everybody was telling me to go talk to that guy.
[88:03.98]We're good.
[88:06.32]We're good.
[88:07.18]Horse, come here.
[88:10.30]On to the mission.
[88:19.64]Save now.
[88:23.93]So these are all towns in trouble.
[88:25.31]Okay.
[88:26.53]Well, I'm going to have to find... I'm going to liberate all the towns because why not?
[88:32.65]Maybe, I mean, I guess on the way down to the other... There's a lot of zombies here.
[88:43.71]Don't fuck with pestilence, buddy.
[88:46.79]It'll get you killed.
[88:53.96]Hard to kill, not impossible to kill.
[88:56.98]And in fact, if I fall down like a cliff, I'm gonna die.
[88:59.76]The horse is gonna be fine, but I'm gonna die.
[89:04.99]I'm not invincible, the horse is.
[89:10.90]Shortcut.
[89:15.04]He has a ton of stamina too, this is fantastic.
[89:17.36]I'm gonna sprint the whole time.
[89:21.28]Normally that would have killed a regular horse, but not this one.
[89:32.85]Just constant speed.
[89:35.18]Who's the best horse?
[89:38.40]Out of all the other four, like, horsemen, which one is the best one?
[89:49.11]The unicorn?
[89:49.75]Don't have to worry about bears now.
[89:53.87]War is...
[90:04.25]Does war have a machine gun mounted on their back or something?
[90:08.10]Why are they so good?
[90:19.40]Fucking set zombies on fire.
[90:22.33]That's kind of insane.
[90:23.25]Wait, what am I doing?
[90:23.93]Go this way.
[90:24.91]Don't go the GPS route.
[90:26.11]It's always wrong.
[90:34.67]That's so cool.
[90:38.24]I'm glad they at least gave an interesting reason to lasso horses.
[90:42.76]It felt like in the main game you didn't need to do that.
[90:50.35]It would have been cool to be able to find horses that were better, that had different stats and stuff, but the whole game I had one horse.
[90:57.39]It would have been fun to know that.
[90:59.27]And the one that I had was the best one, right?
[91:08.22]I'm hitching the horse over here, by the way.
[91:11.98]There you go, he's been hitched.
[91:20.53]Let's talk to the survivor and see what we can do!
[91:27.54]Excuse me.
[91:28.58]That- No, that works.
[91:32.06]How can I help?
[91:32.62]What can I do?
[91:38.32]Here.
[91:38.42]Take some shotgun ammo.
[91:40.42]What about you?
[91:41.76]What do you need?
[91:42.62]I have a lot of shotgun ammo, so... Okay, cool.
[91:47.94]Just wait until I get in the house here.
[91:50.10]If this works.
[92:09.16]Well, that's much better.
[92:10.32]That's a lot easier.
[92:11.28]Playing online.
[92:16.04]I actually was going to try to jump in online when I was done with this.
[92:18.60]Because that would be... That would be kind of fun.
[92:24.16]Just to check it out and see what it's like.
[92:27.31]But I want to at least get to a point where I'm happy playing through this DLC.
[92:31.93]Who knows when that's going to happen.
[92:36.24]Might be in an hour, might be in four hours, I might want to beat the whole thing.
[92:42.13]I just don't know.
[92:46.69]Who's left?
[92:48.19]One guy over here.
[92:56.40]Shit.
[92:58.94]Liberated.
[93:02.20]New weapon?
[93:13.91]While I get a second here, let me take a look at the bits.
[93:16.09]Uh, Rambone, thanks for the five dollars.
[93:17.65]Hey, Jumbo, kiss a Sasquatch for me.
[93:22.05]I did.
[93:22.39]Uh, Spritech, thanks for the bits.
[93:25.71]How the hell do you keep cool in the heat?
[93:28.91]Uh, you get a sprinkler from, like, Target, Walmart, set it up, and just let it hit you right in the mouth.
[93:35.91]Uh, Ricoco, thanks.
[93:37.97]Buy yourself something, Knights.
[93:39.61]I'll try, I'll try.
[93:40.73]Thank you guys for the bits.
[93:45.64]Let's see what I got for a weapon.
[93:53.90]Realistically, I'm only doing this because I want to see if there's new weapons to get.
[94:01.08]Shotgun ammo and what?
[94:02.20]What did I get?
[94:03.96]Did I get anything?
[94:08.28]Tomahawks.
[94:10.28]Cool.
[94:11.80]Tomahawks for this village.
[94:12.70]Let's see what happens in the next one.
[94:18.71]Just like hit my head on the tree.
[94:22.34]Alright, on to the next village.
[94:25.06]And then we go to you.
[94:29.36]There are only two extra weapons, the torch and something amazing.
[94:32.26]Well, might as well see.
[94:35.37]I do want to fill out my repertoire of items though.
[94:48.31]Okay, you can tell when I want to do all the side content that I'm actually, I really like this.
[94:54.52]I don't have to be doing any of this, but it's kind of just fun to do.
[95:01.72]Something about Wild West zombie game.
[95:05.37]Makes me wish that they had...
[95:09.19]the whole game like this.
[95:10.68]Don't pestilence.
[95:11.38]Come on.
[95:12.84]Don't.
[95:14.48]You're being a little unruly, buddy.
[95:16.26]Come on.
[95:18.02]Come on.
[95:19.04]Turn around.
[95:21.18]The undead horses don't listen to you.
[95:24.81]It's almost like they're fucking not alive.
[95:26.53]Okay, let's go.
[95:37.57]There we are.
[95:38.15]That's a big turn.
[95:40.71]You're playing that right now.
[95:41.86]Yeah, but this is only like a, what, like a five to six hour little DLC campaign?
[95:45.66]Let's get in there.
[95:52.05]He's up here.
[95:57.77]What do you need?
[95:58.11]Let me help you.
[96:01.69]Give five sniper rifle ammo.
[96:03.29]Take it!
[96:03.75]Another guy over here.
[96:07.61]Somebody in there too.
[96:12.37]Climbing the window?
[96:22.47]I guess not.
[96:22.93]How do I get in this building?
[96:32.12]Get out of here.
[96:34.02]Oh my god, please.
[96:38.62]I can't move.
[96:39.78]I'm stuck here.
[96:46.74]I'm actually stuck in the grain, by the way.
[96:54.71]What?
[96:56.19]Well, something happened where I got out.
[97:06.27]How do I?
[97:06.55]Is he on the roof?
[97:07.77]He's up on the roof.
[97:14.18]Oh shit!
[97:23.46]I ain't gonna fucking run around like this.
[97:25.42]It's too awkward to jump up on shit in this game.
[97:48.75]Okay We went Why am I getting who's shooting me is this guy actually shooting me?
[98:02.73]What are you doing?
[98:07.35]Does he think I'm a zombie what the fuck are you doing dude?
[98:09.35]Oh?
[98:14.00]He is shooting at me.
[98:15.34]Okay.
[98:24.84]Sorry, dude.
[98:25.68]That's just not going to happen.
[98:29.32]I'm going to take the ammo back.
[98:31.96]The explosion hurt him.
[98:38.00]I tried to just loot these corpses and it didn't work.
[98:39.66]Come on.
[98:42.99]I blew a survivor up?
[98:44.75]The guy on the roof got hit by that shit?
[98:46.37]Did he?
[98:46.63]I'm surprised.
[98:56.62]Let me get my sniper rifle back.
[98:59.90]One revolver ammo.
[99:00.95]Oh, whatever.
[99:01.37]Sniper.
[99:04.53]Oh, there it is.
[99:05.03]Okay.
[99:06.65]There are multiple chests to loot in here.
[99:08.69]Where are they?
[99:16.57]I'm getting shot at again.
[99:20.54]Leave me alone.
[99:21.18]That'll do.
[99:31.08]Tomahawks.
[99:33.22]There's the sniper rifle.
[99:37.08]Cool.
[99:42.36]And there's one more over here.
[99:43.32]And then we'll go do some missions now.
[99:48.48]I think I've got enough actual weapons to get me at least somewhat through this DLC video game.
[99:54.69]Chest in here.
[99:56.47]Where?
[99:56.77]Right here.
[100:12.08]Peter ammo.
[100:16.12]I don't think it was anything new.
[100:21.81]No.
[100:23.79]Nope.
[100:24.99]Nothing new.
[100:25.97]Alright, let's go.
[100:27.27]I'm gonna save it, and then we're gonna go to the next mission.
[100:30.79]The actual mission.
[100:39.06]There's still someone in here that wants me to die.
[100:45.63]Alright, we're done being the funny YouTuber.
[100:47.53]Let's put on, like, the rancher clothing or something.
[100:52.99]Yeah, I'm gonna put on my farmer clothing.
[100:56.49]Travel to destination.
[100:58.67]So when you unlock things, you can faster.
[101:00.35]That's cool.
[101:00.97]Alright, well, I'm gonna go down here.
[101:02.13]We're close enough, so... Close enough!
[101:10.51]Plus, I like riding around.
[101:11.99]It's interesting.
[101:16.54]No, no poncho.
[101:17.22]I had the poncho on for like the better half of the whole main game.
[101:20.06]I want to be Farmer Man.
[101:31.29]No, hold on.
[101:35.99]No.
[101:37.05]Restart.
[101:38.11]Just load the... Okay.
[101:43.50]Um...
[101:45.86]I just saved it two seconds ago.
[101:48.18]So wait, load checkpoint.
[101:49.42]Is that... I can't just load the game?
[101:51.42]Just checkpoint, right?
[102:08.75]Yeah, here it is.
[102:09.55]I just saved it right here.
[102:10.91]Calm down, everybody.
[102:12.99]Wait.
[102:14.91]I have to loot these fucking boxes again.
[102:23.74]I fucking tried to shortcut through the trees and it led me to a lake.
[102:28.56]And I couldn't stop.
[102:29.28]And my clothes are different.
[102:33.64]It's because I changed clothes.
[102:35.69]He was angry with me.
[102:38.83]I didn't save it, I thought I did.
[102:46.15]Well, let's go get the fucking other rifle.
[102:49.19]Actually, I already have it.
[102:50.08]Do I even need to do this?
[102:50.90]Okay.
[103:04.84]Let's go.
[103:05.23]I love how he's just bleeding.
[103:09.53]That's great.
[103:13.51]We're gonna follow the road this time, because it's obviously too dangerous for me to try to shortcut through the trees.
[103:21.87]Hey, is the train undead too?
[103:23.07]Well, that would be funny.
[103:32.10]Change your- Get out of these fucking YouTuber clothes.
[103:41.04]That's a zombie train.
[103:47.81]Well, let's see what the next mission is.
[103:53.61]Unencountered towns have been added.
[103:55.63]There's more towns in need.
[103:57.09]Oh.
[104:14.01]I just ghost row doors into the water.
[104:17.02]Oops.
[104:19.36]Fuck water, man.
[104:20.72]I don't have enough revolver ammo.
[104:23.42]You just told me my breath smelled terrible.
[104:29.19]Well, I don't have revolver ammo for you.
[104:30.69]Sorry, man.
[104:32.95]Maybe the other people I can help.
[104:49.93]There's a lot of zombies here.
[105:04.68]I think I'm just going to chill here.
[105:09.12]I think I am.
[105:10.42]No sense running out there if I don't have any revolver ammo for them.
[105:17.00]At least in my personal, this is a fucking clown.
[105:19.88]No, it's not.
[105:20.80]I honestly thought that was like a clown.
[105:26.58]Alright, let me move.
[105:30.00]It's gonna take a while, but I don't want to lose.
[105:48.75]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, easy.
[105:57.25]Shit.
[106:02.05]Shit!
[106:02.63]Not good.
[106:03.37]Very bad.
[106:03.97]Get this fucking shotgun off.
[106:05.30]What the hell am I thinking here?
[106:07.26]Don't use the shotgun.
[106:09.08]Shotgun sucks here.
[106:10.68]Shotgun is not good in this DLC.
[106:19.84]one two not much longer now only a few more
[106:49.00]Let's go ahead and end this.
[106:51.98]This should do it.
[106:59.69]Kill the remaining people, yes.
[107:10.16]Oh, Jesus Christ, I don't have... Thank God I have Chewing Tobacco.
[107:16.63]Because I was waiting to do like a super Deadeye here.
[107:20.23]If you were wondering why I was waiting so long.
[107:45.39]Hyper Combo!
[107:46.53]Alright, that's it.
[107:55.88]Combo breaker.
[107:56.94]That was fun.
[107:59.18]Town has been saved.
[107:59.86]I need it.
[108:00.72]I need, like, revolver ammo, man.
[108:08.71]Got it here.
[108:10.21]Loot the houses.
[108:14.47]Something in this house.
[108:17.81]In the thieves' saloon.
[108:19.23]Right here?
[108:24.29]There it is.
[108:30.68]Anything new?
[108:31.12]Ooh!
[108:35.14]That's cool.
[108:36.42]Unlocked molotovs.
[108:41.00]Pestilence still dead?
[108:41.86]Did he climb out of the water yet?
[108:50.51]He's fine.
[108:57.79]And... Anything else?
[109:00.17]I do need that revolver ammo bad.
[109:01.89]I need repeater ammo.
[109:07.59]I have a ton of shotgun ammo, but I have a lot of shotgun and a lot of sniper rifle ammo.
[109:11.67]But I feel like those are the two worst things you could use in this DLC.
[109:16.11]Oh, well.
[109:17.93]Let's move.
[109:20.39]What?
[109:24.73]Where's Pestilence?
[109:32.28]Where is he?
[109:32.88]What?
[109:37.56]We dunked him in the fucking water last time and he was fine.
[109:39.98]What?
[109:42.89]I killed him.
[109:43.93]I drove into the water before.
[109:48.68]He's at the bottom of the lake.
[109:51.21]I killed the unkillable horse.
[109:53.73]What?
[109:55.63]He's dead.
[109:56.21]Because I ghost rode him into the lake accidentally.
[110:09.65]I just saved your life, lady.
[110:10.63]Thank you.
[110:12.07]God knows what he would have done to me.
[110:15.33]I'm just sorry it had to be that way.
[110:16.81]Sorry, lady.
[110:18.71]Your husband's gone.
[110:22.72]Oh, thank the lords!
[110:24.00]I might as well just get my warhorse again.
[110:25.74]Oh, that sucks.
[110:28.70]That sucks.
[110:30.24]That's really terrible.
[110:32.46]There's one more chest over here.
[110:39.15]A sacred chest.
[110:43.45]He's not unkillable.
[110:47.05]Don't you walk into the fucking water, too.
[110:50.87]Look at how close that was.
[110:53.34]Another, like, couple inches of... Oh, no, never mind.
[111:01.10]Warhorse is better.
[111:01.98]I don't know.
[111:02.78]I disagree with that one.
[111:04.68]Pestilence had infinite stamina.
[111:07.24]You could just sprint the whole time.
[111:08.54]Okay, that's more revolver ammo.
[111:13.91]Good, good, good.
[111:17.57]Okay.
[111:19.10]I'm happy.
[111:20.06]Let's go.
[111:20.34]Let's do the mission.
[111:27.76]Shit's on fire.
[111:31.83]Oh, shit.
[111:32.21]My poor bare feet.
[111:37.45]There's another chest.
[111:39.83]Jesus.
[111:42.27]I have to get these.
[111:43.07]They're important.
[111:46.38]Ride around it.
[111:50.43]Where was it?
[111:50.81]Over here?
[111:55.35]All the way in the back.
[111:57.73]Is it on the beach?
[112:01.80]And I did it again!
[112:02.76]I did it again.
[112:04.68]Almost did it again.
[112:06.54]That was close.
[112:10.04]Shit.
[112:11.44]Ugh.
[112:12.08]It's right in there.
[112:14.90]Can I jump this?
[112:15.62]Come on, John.
[112:17.10]John, you can do this.
[112:18.14]I know you can.
[112:32.68]Why?
[112:43.47]Somebody just said stop jumping off him at high speeds.
[112:45.89]He was standing here.
[112:46.79]He was fine.
[112:47.87]He was standing still right here.
[112:49.27]He walked in.
[112:53.47]I didn't do that.
[112:54.29]He walked in.
[112:57.49]I'm getting shit for that, but guys, I didn't ghost ride him into that water.
[113:00.99]He was just standing on the edge.
[113:10.12]I can't grab this, can I?
[113:11.84]It's just too high, apparently.
[113:14.38]I'm going to take this as a sign that I'm just going to get the fuck out of here.
[113:16.65]No, I can't.
[113:18.89]I have to get it.
[113:26.74]I have to get it.
[113:27.37]It's a chest.
[113:29.01]Could be something really good.
[113:29.87]Who put all these boxes here?
[113:37.64]Alright, let's see what it is.
[113:58.39]Let me out of here!
[113:59.45]Let me the fuck out of here!
[114:03.27]No!
[114:03.77]Shit!
[114:04.05]Now I'm on fire!
[114:05.67]Stop drop and roll!
[114:06.51]Stop drop and roll!
[114:07.39]I need to go in the water!
[114:14.45]I'm fucking out of here.
[114:15.33]I'm leaving.
[114:15.61]I don't care if it's the best weapon in the whole game.
[114:17.82]I'm gone.
[114:24.26]That could literally be...
[114:26.69]A automatic rocket launcher.
[114:29.41]And I don't even give a shit.
[114:30.45]I can't even leave the town.
[114:32.87]Why is everything boarded up?
[114:35.21]How do I open these gates?
[114:36.09]Am I locked in here forever?
[114:40.80]What in the name of fucking God?
[114:55.42]Okay.
[114:58.85]Climb over here.
[114:59.53]And... We're gonna drop down here.
[115:07.71]I made it out of the town.
[115:10.50]And we're out.
[115:10.88]We're gonna get the chest as well.
[115:17.72]Okay, we got revolver ammo.
[115:40.32]Okay.
[115:56.85]Fucking serious.
[115:57.73]Come on.
[115:58.25]Grab that.
[116:03.18]So, I don't think
[116:06.45]I don't think in like the 22 hours I played Red Dead... Red... That's why.
[116:14.20]It's the first time I've ever opened a gate in this game.
[116:31.81]Hey look, he's back and he's dead.
[116:40.16]Okay, let's go.
[117:03.65]give a fuck anymore.
[117:04.63]You think I care about saving people?
[117:06.80]I was doing that guy a favor.
[117:07.82]He was already gone.
[117:09.24]He already got bit.
[117:26.61]Yeah, I know I shot the guy.
[117:27.77]I did it because I thought it was going to be funny.
[117:29.73]Because he was already gone.
[117:30.83]He was just a goof.
[117:34.63]At least he's still around.
[117:45.95]I'm goofing more than usual?
[117:47.09]Well, this is like an undead fucking DLC.
[117:50.06]This is a joke DLC.
[117:51.42]I love it.
[117:52.36]Come on.
[117:52.74]Come here, boy.
[118:06.55]What are you doing?
[118:08.53]We were boyhood friends, John.
[118:12.97]Moses is having a tough time right now.
[118:16.51]Ain't you, pal?
[118:18.85]What's going on?
[118:20.74]We're playing cards.
[118:22.32]Relax, sit down.
[118:24.66]I mean, with the undead walking the face of the Earth, you crazy dumb bastard.
[118:29.62]That ain't nothing.
[118:31.34]Ain't nothing?
[118:33.07]I've seen husbands eating wives.
[118:35.19]Mothers eating sons.
[118:37.22]Graves popping open and the undead rising up.
[118:39.62]She's playing cards with this guy.
[118:42.48]Oh, boo-hoo.
[118:43.74]Big tough John Marston has scared a little undead creature walking around.
[118:47.88]Moses wouldn't hurt a fly, would you, darling?
[118:51.52]He's going to get bit.
[118:53.14]He's going to turn and bite him right in the neck.
[118:57.49]Folks in Blackwater are blaming it on that glass eye you found.
[119:00.79]Oh.
[119:02.42]After all I've done for you Seth and I thought loyalty was important to you He sounds like a Sasquatch
[119:32.93]Looks like your dog's lost his bite, Seth.
[119:36.03]Now what the hell's going on?
[119:38.71]The dead have risen, and a virulent plague is turning people into flesh-eating crazies.
[119:48.14]What the hell do you think's going on, genius?
[119:51.52]But why?
[119:52.72]But why, why, why, why not, why not?
[119:55.66]Put some clothes on, I can't take this.
[119:57.54]Because it ain't natural.
[119:59.71]sorry my pajamas are mother superior all at the same time who made you John Marston same as made me same as made Moses is there a cure these things tend to fade away now if you want to get rid of it you should go clear the graveyards either that or stop worrying and become one of
[120:28.37]I'm wearing the same outfit as him.
[120:29.89]Except he has fur jeans on.
[120:31.40]He's a little dirtier.
[120:32.46]This is so dumb.
[121:06.50]Clear out the three new Austin graveyards.
[121:10.42]Okay.
[121:14.16]But first... Wait, what?
[121:24.17]Can I just shoot him?
[121:26.59]No, he'll probably... It'll probably end the mission.
[121:34.40]Did he just fall off?
[121:35.84]Oh, no.
[121:36.20]Don't, like, do this.
[121:37.00]Don't, like, glitch and then fall off.
[121:40.76]Okay, well.
[121:45.26]Just kind of scared me there for a second.
[121:48.00]Let's change.
[121:53.57]Let's go back to... I like the duster.
[121:58.73]Duster's cool.
[122:02.61]I don't remember inviting anything.
[122:06.12]Let's go.
[122:14.99]Save it, the game just saved.
[122:18.49]We just saved the game.
[122:24.09]These horses are like so unruly.
[122:26.57]This is way worse than Pestilence was.
[122:28.09]This horse is drunk.
[122:41.46]Okay, well, I guess this guy needs help.
[122:50.63]One, two, three, four, five.
[122:58.59]Let's do it.
[123:05.41]No, still need to kill a couple.
[123:08.76]Last lady.
[123:10.42]And what do I get?
[123:12.08]You gonna give me something?
[123:16.56]Is that it?
[123:17.66]You don't have anything for me?
[123:21.26]No, he gave me a sniper rifle.
[123:22.84]One sniper rifle ammo.
[123:23.89]Thanks, dude.
[123:28.06]I unloaded a whole clip to save that guy.
[123:30.92]See, this is why you don't fucking save people.
[123:33.60]Everyone gave me shit for shooting that guy in, like, the nuts.
[123:36.80]And look, I used a whole clip.
[123:40.80]That dude ran away.
[123:42.14]That was all he gave me.
[123:47.51]Go lasso that guy.
[123:54.79]I'm gonna try to snipe.
[123:55.71]Might as well use the damn thing.
[123:57.65]It's better than nothing.
[124:03.27]Yeah, but I mean, I would have much rather used my revolver ammo for something that I would want to have.
[124:12.00]I traded one.
[124:13.08]I got like a tomahawk.
[124:14.08]I guess it's not terrible, but you know.
[124:21.69]Can't control the horse okay guys that the horse is uncontrollable sometimes and it decided to be uncontrollable right next to a bridge So that that was almost a disaster I Don't want I know I really don't want this horse
[124:49.92]It's kind of like, you know when you lasso a horse and you have to stay on top of him and hold left and right?
[124:54.38]That's what's happening right now.
[124:58.06]It has this infinite stamina.
[125:01.44]But it drives around... terribly.
[125:04.57]Let's go down this way.
[125:13.37]What's with this GPS?
[125:14.57]Taking me all kinds of in the wrong direction.
[125:17.68]Like, am I crazy?
[125:18.48]Or, like, why is it making me go all the way that way?
[125:20.08]Just go straight.
[125:26.73]You want me just to let it sway?
[125:27.93]Okay, I'm not gonna do any correction at all.
[125:29.77]Here we go.
[125:30.27]Ready?
[125:31.07]No, let's get it straight away so you can see.
[125:32.29]Okay.
[125:34.23]No correction.
[125:36.19]I'm not touching the analog at all.
[125:42.08]It's just doing whatever it wants.
[125:44.10]My hand is off the thumbstick.
[125:48.19]Alright, you saw.
[125:48.71]That was funny.
[125:49.41]Cool.
[125:49.79]Good.
[125:50.14]Alright, let's go.
[125:50.72]Alright, slow this down here.
[126:04.44]This is dangerous.
[126:09.40]Is there any water over there?
[126:12.06]No water, right?
[126:12.84]Yeah, no water.
[126:13.68]This won't kill me.
[126:17.62]Let's just get down here.
[126:23.34]Do not run into the water, please.
[126:29.07]I need to slow down, because it will happen.
[126:32.01]And I don't want to start this over again.
[126:33.29]That would be very bad.
[126:37.22]Okay.
[126:45.24]Clear the graveyard.
[126:49.56]Some new towns have been added.
[126:50.98]Good.
[126:55.26]Okay, let's set up a little roost.
[127:05.11]Clear the graveyard.
[127:08.21]There's nothing here yet.
[127:09.35]Okay, I get it.
[127:10.07]Just gonna do that thing where they all come out of the ground.
[127:13.11]Let me just make sure I have everything loaded.
[127:14.75]I do.
[127:16.17]Okay, let's go.
[127:18.66]Burn the coffins.
[127:19.58]Yep.
[127:19.72]I'm going to do this again.
[127:23.37]Coffee or tea?
[127:24.25]Coffee.
[127:26.61]I would say coffee.
[127:28.39]I love coffee.
[127:28.95]I drink it a lot.
[127:36.75]I do have molotovs too.
[127:38.03]Let's see if I can just round up a bunch of them.
[127:44.99]I'm getting a lot of ammo.
[127:45.81]That's good.
[127:52.04]Get the horse over here just because.
[127:53.76]I just like Jack be nimble, Jack be quick to that thing.
[128:03.35]Thought I was going to light on fire.
[128:08.11]Clear out the graveyard.
[128:10.83]This is like kind of freaking me out.
[128:18.07]I got to calm down here.
[128:32.38]Let's do a double here.
[128:37.96]Just get a double kill.
[128:53.44]That it?
[128:55.26]Any more?
[128:56.08]How many more?
[128:56.53]Oh, shit.
[129:01.79]This is like an old fucking president.
[129:08.66]Force, get out of the way.
[129:23.06]What?
[129:23.26]What's going on?
[129:25.57]Oh, it's a cutscene.
[129:26.83]Guy alone, age 65, the truth.
[129:28.77]Okay, well.
[129:29.33]I don't know where I am.
[129:38.06]Do I have enough bullets?
[129:41.59]I'm in the graveyard.
[129:49.71]That's a clown.
[129:50.67]That's another clown.
[129:51.93]Alright, stop fucking talking about that and just... Did I do that?
[129:56.09]I guess I didn't.
[130:02.29]Alright, good.
[130:08.18]Coot's Chapel cleansed.
[130:09.20]I don't remember throwing an axe at that guy, but okay.
[130:20.24]Thank you, Irish, for the $5.
[130:21.10]I'm skipping a day of college for this.
[130:24.62]It's worth it.
[130:25.30]Well, hopefully you get your schooling complete.
[130:27.54]And you study well on your next exam.
[130:31.40]But thank you for the $5.
[130:32.30]Appreciate it.
[130:34.14]Deadly Pig, thanks for the $10.
[130:36.33]What's my opinion on Vietnam?
[130:40.43]Vietnam is a country.
[130:44.61]My girlfriend's from Vietnam.
[130:46.43]So, it's cool, huh?
[130:54.10]Skipping college.
[130:55.36]These missions are long, too.
[131:00.44]I feel like I want to get these ready, but I don't at the same time.
[131:10.39]JKF.
[131:12.71]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[131:15.63]And they really spread out.
[131:16.91]Damn.
[131:19.52]Dinner for two.
[131:20.32]Is this going to fail this mission if I go over here?
[131:27.02]Or are these just here now?
[131:28.86]If I activate dinner for two, is that gonna mess up this mission I'm currently on?
[131:39.77]Uh, JKF, thank you for the ten bucks, though.
[131:41.31]Coffee or tea?
[131:42.19]Cheetos or chicken?
[131:42.91]Chicken or pork?
[131:43.69]Well, coffee... I see what you're doing.
[131:46.97]I almost just did it.
[131:50.23]Coffee or tea?
[131:52.93]Yeah, those three things combined.
[131:55.13]Yes, I enjoy them all.
[132:01.43]Got it.
[132:05.59]Is this a death drop?
[132:09.27]No, it is not.
[132:14.69]Dinner for two.
[132:17.81]I think it's in a town that needs to be liberated as well.
[132:21.01]An armadillo?
[132:21.67]Yes, it is.
[132:25.12]Let's do this first.
[132:32.50]Alright, what do you need?
[132:34.50]Look at how much this, look at that, how many blips that is.
[132:38.96]That's two traffic lights worth of blips.
[132:40.60]I ain't doing that shit.
[132:43.18]We need five Peter, take it.
[132:45.87]This is Armadillo, this place is fucking huge.
[132:53.81]This is gonna take a long time to liberate this place.
[132:55.73]Why am I on fire?
[132:57.71]Why am I on fire?
[133:05.71]Get outta here!
[133:07.95]Oh, these like fuckin' squirrel zombies!
[133:10.59]Leave me alone!
[133:14.08]There's too many squirrel zombies in this town.
[133:16.80]They're all on the roof.
[133:20.83]Climb it.
[133:24.92]What do you need?
[133:26.74]Take repeater ammo.
[133:31.08]They all need repeater ammo?
[133:32.12]I hope not.
[133:32.83]That's too much to have to give.
[133:34.17]Fine.
[133:34.61]Alright, that's all you guys are getting.
[133:38.01]Now we're just gonna have to shoot from up here.
[134:01.57]Stick aiming.
[134:02.67]Stick aiming, right guys?
[134:03.95]I have a lot of sniper rifle ammo.
[134:11.62]I'm just gonna use it.
[134:21.44]You want another what?
[134:24.44]What are we having?
[134:25.00]What are we having?
[134:25.70]Multiple up?
[134:41.66]Alright.
[134:43.02]Come on.
[134:44.76]I thought you had a gun in your hands, but you didn't.
[134:48.64]Shit in my pants.
[134:49.70]Easy.
[134:49.98]I don't know why I got down.
[135:04.12]Why did I get down?
[135:05.60]I will never know.
[135:12.90]One guy appeared behind me.
[135:14.32]Good for you, almost.
[135:17.46]They all run for me.
[135:20.24]Why can't they run to anybody else?
[135:26.65]Every single one of them is currently on fire, too.
[135:36.13]Why did that stop?
[135:41.95]I can stop concentrating.
[135:49.72]Let's go loot the town.
[135:58.88]Run to the people on the roof.
[136:01.37]I feel like I'm going to get accidentally shot in the back.
[136:12.36]I need more repeater bullets.
[136:13.24]I need more pretty much everything.
[136:17.16]Let's save the game.
[136:21.98]Open up this chest.
[136:25.58]That's not the right chest.
[136:26.56]It's in the house.
[136:28.40]Get the right one, god damn it.
[136:32.57]There's revolver ammo.
[136:33.85]That's exactly what I wanted.
[136:34.77]I do need repeater ammo.
[136:41.47]Alright, so there's a few more chests.
[136:43.17]There's one more at the ground level.
[136:44.23]There's one up there.
[136:44.85]Let's go get it.
[136:50.59]Oh, what a fucking idiot.
[136:51.91]Guy gets the wrong chest.
[136:54.69]How dare he.
[136:57.72]I hate his guts.
[137:01.66]More revolver.
[137:05.02]Can't say I need revolver ammo, but I'll take it.
[137:07.86]There's repeater ammo.
[137:11.09]Good.
[137:19.72]Boneless Bacon, thank you for the $5.
[137:21.44]Did you know that hippos can swim up to 354 miles per hour?
[137:26.62]Uh, that's total bullshit.
[137:27.88]That's not even... That's a... That is a bold... You know, I'm gonna give you credit, Boneless.
[137:31.73]That is a bold lie.
[137:35.13]Like, that's such a lie that it might be true.
[137:38.01]You know?
[137:38.31]Like, that is such a fucking obvious lie that that could be real.
[137:47.25]I'm getting texted.
[137:54.07]Uh, get up to the top of this.
[137:56.79]Get the free shit up here.
[137:57.71]It's a bold truth.
[138:07.20]Well, I'm not going to need revolver ammo anytime soon.
[138:09.48]Might as well just keep it out to use it.
[138:14.32]Alright, let's... Where's the next thing?
[138:21.01]There we go.
[138:21.75]It's actually right here, isn't it?
[138:22.75]I can just run.
[138:26.97]Let's break the sound barrier apparently.
[138:28.99]Oh, did you hear that?
[138:30.65]That was gross.
[138:31.11]I'm sorry I'm a zombie clown Sorry boys she didn't give me a whole lot of choice Hello, John
[138:57.49]Welcome to Paradise.
[138:58.65]Sheriff.
[139:00.03]Hello, Marshall.
[139:02.33]Might have known you'd survive.
[139:04.85]What's going on?
[139:06.73]Do I look like I commune with the undead?
[139:09.42]Yeah.
[139:10.16]I don't know.
[139:11.28]Well, then how would I know?
[139:13.00]My job is to take care of the folk who live here.
[139:15.44]What was the point of that?
[139:18.24]I don't know.
[139:18.66]Oh, you heard that one.
[139:20.66]No idea.
[139:20.96]I think he just did it for fun.
[139:23.11]To, like, get off.
[139:23.87]I didn't mean that in the way that I did, but I just said it, so... I gotta reply to this person in a second.
[139:48.87]Two clowns, see?
[140:17.05]What happened to those two fucking clowns?
[140:18.63]I don't know.
[140:19.47]I don't know what's going on.
[140:20.53]John, everybody's a fucking clown these days.
[140:22.37]See how many clown zombies we have here?
[140:26.61]That's a good question.
[140:29.17]Where'd you send them?
[140:31.35]Out near the general store.
[140:34.27]Jonah's got one of these new guns.
[140:36.69]I'm sure he can't run into any trouble.
[140:39.53]These things?
[140:40.73]They'd stop an elephant.
[140:41.71]I killed all the clowns.
[140:42.79]Thank you.
[140:43.89]No, thank you.
[140:50.35]I'm surprised at how many actual clown emotes there are.
[140:58.55]There's a lot of clown emotes.
[141:05.74]Alright, well we have these two to do.
[141:11.62]We have this one, M, with Dinner for Two still.
[141:16.12]If we're in the town right now, I might as well just do it.
[141:17.94]Uh oh.
[141:37.40]This whole thing is nothing but a Jewish plot.
[141:40.92]You do know that, don't you?
[141:42.65]But the undead apocalypse is a plot, apparently.
[141:44.75]Oh, God.
[141:45.25]Well, I don't like Jews.
[141:48.37]Or colored folk.
[141:49.27]God.
[141:50.27]Or natives, now that you mention it.
[141:52.75]Well, you're a nice, kind-hearted man to meet in a time of trouble.
[141:57.61]Kind does not come into it.
[141:59.97]What is shooting out there?
[142:01.29]What are you talking about?
[142:02.63]Why?
[142:04.00]I bet you like Catholics.
[142:06.26]I can't stand them neither.
[142:07.62]This guy's voice does not match his age.
[142:10.14]Fabians, socialists, homosexuals, Asians, or British.
[142:15.68]What the hell is this guy?
[142:16.64]They ruined this country.
[142:17.96]Ruined it.
[142:18.74]It was a good country once.
[142:19.84]Sounds like a kid.
[142:20.42]No people are eating each other.
[142:21.78]And it's all the fault of the Jewish, British, Catholic, homosexual elite and their ideas.
[142:26.85]Well, I for one won't stand for it.
[142:31.51]Have you ever met a Jewish person?
[142:35.01]Thankfully not.
[142:37.09]Or a British Catholic homosexual?
[142:40.37]Not in my store.
[142:42.99]Oh, I get it.
[142:44.13]I see you acting clever.
[142:46.59]Well, let me tell you this.
[142:48.43]The Jews killed Lincoln.
[142:51.55]That's why there is a triangle on the money.
[142:54.27]You're on a black one of them Arabian harems.
[142:58.15]Now they've sent this here plague to kill all us decent folk.
[143:03.96]Yep.
[143:05.32]You, sir, are truly a remarkable fella.
[143:08.82]Thank you kindly.
[143:09.90]I must say, it's a rare pleasure to meet someone with such a grasp on human history.
[143:15.59]You take care of yourself.
[143:16.95]What?
[143:17.57]I'd hate to see you get savaged by someone and watch the life force drain from your hate-filled body.
[143:22.73]Hey, hold on there.
[143:25.53]Why don't you join me in my fight, sir?
[143:28.53]It's not too late.
[143:30.13]A fear it is for me.
[143:33.47]Oh, this guy's gonna die a terrible death.
[143:36.63]He's about to get fucking murdered.
[143:43.03]You, like, knew it was gonna happen.
[143:53.68]This guy was, like, far too racist and mean and awful to not, like, instantly die, right?
[144:04.14]I mean, they were setting this guy up to have a gruesome death.
[144:09.45]He's gonna stand up, isn't he?
[144:13.33]Oh, there he is.
[144:20.54]Where is he?
[144:20.94]There he is.
[144:22.02]Alright, Herbert Moon.
[144:30.95]That was pathetic.
[144:33.91]Come on, Mr. Moon.
[144:35.23]What's the matter?
[144:37.61]Oh, you're going to die that easily?
[144:39.25]Oh, fine.
[144:46.20]Well.
[144:49.24]He had moonshine.
[144:51.30]I wanted to do a little thing there with Mr. Moon, but no.
[144:53.26]Apparently not.
[144:55.56]We're not doing that, apparently.
[144:58.86]Alright, look.
[144:59.26]We're searching for some more people.
[145:01.62]The search continues.
[145:08.80]I love how they can just be anywhere.
[145:11.80]That makes this not so easy, does it?
[145:13.35]I feel like I'm playing Sniper Elite.
[145:20.23]Gotta find him in the fucking circle!
[145:21.81]There it is.
[145:26.29]They were just eating each other.
[145:41.46]Easy now, gentlemen.
[145:43.68]Remember all the fun times we had?
[145:51.20]Blink, blink.
[145:54.36]Bye, guys.
[145:54.92]Oh, that was the baby.
[145:55.90]That was the baby guy.
[145:56.48]I remember these two.
[145:57.10]The guy with the adult baby face.
[145:58.60]When I see the monsters, I want to...
[146:12.35]Watch out for those monsters.
[146:17.80]This stream gets fucked.
[146:22.18]Is that a golden revolver?
[146:23.74]Um... I believe it is.
[146:25.83]I believe it is.
[146:28.49]Looks pretty golden to me, right?
[146:32.27]Although it could just be bronze.
[146:34.61]Which is the metal I deserve.
[146:37.11]I don't deserve a gold gun.
[146:38.87]Maybe the silver, if I really pled my case.
[146:42.02]It's probably bronze, though.
[146:46.94]Hello, John.
[146:48.28]Hello, Marshal.
[146:51.18]So, you find the boys?
[146:53.36]Yeah, they did.
[146:55.18]I found them.
[146:58.12]I understand.
[146:58.74]I hope it was fast for them.
[147:01.87]What is going on with the chat right now?
[147:07.44]The chat's just out of control.
[147:08.72]What's going on here?
[147:09.36]Mods are corrupt.
[147:09.86]What happened?
[147:32.24]Oh, I did dinner for two.
[147:39.12]Alright.
[147:48.03]Let's do this one.
[147:49.91]And head down to here.
[147:52.80]I can liberate this town too.
[148:05.45]Was it the Herbert Moon situation?
[148:07.45]Is that what this was?
[148:23.00]No, fuck it.
[148:23.46]Like, Herbert Moon came on screen and it started a war.
[148:36.84]Is my horse a zombie?
[148:37.56]Yes it is.
[148:40.44]If you're just joining us, this is the Undead Nightmare DLC for Red Dead Redemption.
[148:44.69]It's a separate campaign entirely.
[148:53.47]It's not connected to the main story really at all.
[148:55.79]It's just kind of here and it's fun.
[149:04.09]So, we got another graveyard to clean up.
[149:08.33]Alright, you stay around here, buddy.
[149:10.39]Get the revolver out.
[149:11.11]I'm gonna have to clean multiple heads at the same time.
[149:14.65]Burn it!
[149:14.95]Let's do the... Let's connect the dots.
[149:21.04]Do four corners.
[149:24.26]Let's do the four corners of the apocalypse.
[149:37.14]And then turn, I'm going to do the ultimate.
[149:43.37]And here we go.
[149:49.95]Holy shit, this lady doesn't have a head.
[149:51.33]Oh, they all don't have heads.
[149:53.53]That makes it a little bit more difficult.
[149:57.01]That makes it a little harder when they don't have heads to shoot.
[149:59.37]Did I get him?
[150:04.97]I don't know.
[150:05.55]I think so.
[150:12.46]Shit.
[150:13.00]Yeah, they all are headless.
[150:17.36]That guy doesn't even have arms.
[150:19.06]This guy's arms are gone.
[150:20.02]This guy has a walking t-shirt.
[150:21.84]These are just clothing.
[150:25.30]This is called the invisible man.
[150:28.08]Their fucking clothes came to life.
[150:39.75]Another fucking walking t-shirt.
[150:45.94]I need to, like, use slow-mo every time.
[150:47.88]Oh, god damn it.
[150:48.96]I have to do that.
[150:57.74]Just wait for the named person to run out.
[151:09.88]I think I got it.
[151:11.38]I think so.
[151:11.80]I hope so.
[151:22.20]Don't have any more of that, do I?
[151:31.87]Oh no, my crutch is gone, guys.
[151:33.45]What do I do?
[151:41.19]Christ.
[151:54.94]Fucking assholes.
[151:56.12]Grow some heads.
[151:57.40]Can't listens do that shit?
[151:59.01]If you cut a listens head off, the head grows back.
[152:00.97]Isn't that how it works?
[152:13.61]Okay, we ain't doing that.
[152:17.57]We just ain't fucking doing that.
[152:33.94]His head grew back for a second.
[152:35.02]It won't last in a long time.
[152:42.93]Get him in the head, please!
[152:52.94]How much ammo do I got?
[152:59.08]60?
[152:59.12]Yeah, I got 20.
[153:07.63]I'm scaring your pet lizard.
[153:17.56]Dead.
[153:20.84]Dead.
[153:23.32]Who's left?
[153:23.74]I've got a lot of corpses to loot after this.
[153:32.67]Alright.
[153:39.35]They're really dragging this one out, aren't they?
[153:49.53]We're still going with this?
[153:54.38]Am I doing something wrong here?
[154:06.36]What's happening?
[154:11.27]I'm stuck here forever.
[154:20.35]So, because it's glitched, it'll never end?
[154:24.68]Are you fucking serious?
[154:33.67]Okay.
[154:36.62]I swear I read two-thirds of cha- Whoa, yeah, but I'm, like, concentrating to try to kill- You want me just to stare at the screen and die?
[154:42.57]Alright, well, did I get it far enough away?
[154:49.39]I have to restart the game.
[154:56.85]Well, that sucks.
[154:59.25]So, it lets you see- Is it gonna happen again?
[155:01.35]I guess it's gonna happen- Let's just see if it happens again.
[155:09.47]Okay, well, we're leaving.
[155:16.47]It was fun while it lasted.
[155:18.59]My game machine broke.
[155:19.63]I'm just gonna go do this mission over here.
[155:21.54]No, I'm gonna liberate the town and then I'll save it and restart right here.
[155:27.10]That's kind of annoying.
[155:33.73]Wait, the bug makes it so you can't save the game and zombies never stop spawning.
[155:41.76]That's... That's not good.
[155:54.33]So this is... I'm never gonna be able to complete this thing.
[156:04.06]No, I'm gonna... Wait, even the people don't have heads.
[156:11.07]Does that mean the people can't die?
[156:13.65]Let's find out.
[156:17.41]It really is an undead nightmare.
[156:21.85]Nobody can die.
[156:29.42]What a nightmare.
[156:33.90]Let's see if I was right.
[156:37.10]Yeah, nobody has a head.
[156:38.76]So I can't do this.
[156:42.12]So no matter what, I have to turn the game off.
[156:45.48]Yep, I do.
[156:49.00]Oh, that's fucking irritating.
[156:51.94]Um...
[157:12.81]What?
[157:26.22]Where was my last checkpoint?
[157:28.46]This... This sucks.
[157:29.54]Okay.
[157:30.30]Um... Load game?
[157:35.81]Just the auto... Dinner for two?
[157:37.09]That's the last thing I did, right?
[157:40.63]Like...
[157:47.26]Fucking Herbert Moon fucked this whole thing up, didn't he?
[157:52.53]Okay, people have heads?
[157:58.11]Check, we're gonna check for a head.
[157:59.13]Okay, do you people have heads?
[158:10.79]That's the question that we're going to have to answer.
[158:16.40]I think so.
[158:16.92]Somebody was riding down there.
[158:17.82]I believe they had a head.
[158:20.19]So let's try this again.
[158:25.82]Still have ammo.
[158:26.58]Alright.
[158:49.10]6 out of 66, that's true.
[158:51.02]It's a sign.
[158:54.21]It is a sign, guys.
[158:55.37]Alright, please don't happen again.
[159:07.65]That would make me very sad if it happened again.
[159:20.71]Okay.
[159:22.70]Say a prayer for me.
[159:24.92]Here we go.
[159:28.30]Please have heads.
[159:29.72]Please.
[159:38.42]They have heads!
[159:40.92]Excellent.
[159:45.72]I can shoot their heads.
[159:58.14]Say a silent prayer for me, Johnny Marston.
[160:07.28]Okay.
[160:08.95]Let's go.
[160:13.53]Come on.
[160:14.17]Tilt.
[160:14.47]Tilt your head.
[160:15.19]Tilt.
[160:16.05]Whatever.
[160:24.93]I was wondering, too.
[160:25.67]I was like, there's no way I'm not doing this right.
[160:36.98]Something has to be completely wrong here.
[160:39.40]See one with no head?
[160:41.16]No, you don't.
[160:42.28]You definitely don't.
[160:55.92]Well, now you do.
[160:59.08]There we go.
[161:00.30]That took so- what a waste of fucking time.
[161:03.44]That was such a waste of time.
[161:11.19]Well, you were easy.
[161:13.19]Do I get into some range here?
[161:25.58]Come on.
[161:33.87]Come on.
[161:34.91]Got.
[161:36.59]Okay.
[161:39.33]Sector liberated.
[161:44.33]What a game.
[161:48.25]How long was I sitting there doing that for?
[161:50.08]Before realizing that I could not progress in the game.
[161:53.02]I had to have killed at least like 40 or 50, like 30 or 40 zombies, right?
[161:56.36]Something like that.
[161:59.80]It was too many.
[162:05.02]Nothing?
[162:05.30]Come on.
[162:06.69]You guys don't have anything.
[162:09.57]Sector clear.
[162:17.51]So now that brings us to... Let's liberate this place.
[162:21.15]Do this last one.
[162:22.07]Wrap around to Rio Bravo.
[162:24.80]But before we do any of that, I have to use the bathroom.
[162:27.60]I gotta pee.
[162:28.40]I'll be right back.
[162:29.18]I'll see you guys in a few minutes.
[166:14.55]Okay.
[166:16.43]We're back.
[166:19.03]And we are back.
[166:19.99]Welcome back to the broadcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[166:23.84]Playing Red Dead Redemption on twitch.tv.
[166:25.74]Welcome back.
[166:28.88]Should I start doing this?
[166:34.45]You think more people would watch if I acted like this more often?
[166:36.69]Alright, come on, horse.
[166:42.05]Let's get out of here, buddy.
[166:44.74]So we're gonna take the road, uh, north.
[166:47.26]And the road up north is gonna be taking us straight to the next town.
[166:50.76]Really excited about next town.
[166:52.80]They've got all kinds of guns, weaponry, all kinds of stuff.
[166:55.82]Watch out for that cactus, buddy!
[166:57.90]Uh, so I'm gonna be taking a right of the fork here.
[166:59.82]There's a fork in this road.
[167:00.64]Also, remember the fork there.
[167:08.38]And looks like we've got some trouble up here.
[167:11.42]Town's under attack, gonna go for the horse.
[167:14.33]I'm gonna take out the, for this one I'm gonna use the shotgun for the close range.
[167:24.66]One doofy.
[167:31.58]I'm having a little bit of an issue because I fucking can't aim with a console stick.
[167:38.28]Make sure you shoot the clowns first.
[167:42.51]Uh...
[167:48.81]This doesn't require... Hey!
[167:49.93]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[167:53.44]I'm only a small town, I can take care of this one.
[167:57.90]Don't you do this fucking dumb crawl.
[168:03.73]Well, hi.
[168:20.51]Whoa, we got double, double, double, double.
[168:23.01]This is not what I want, not what I want, not what I want, not what I... No, he's gotta be in the head.
[168:29.41]Fucking clowns.
[168:35.97]Your head is like in the... Jesus.
[168:51.64]I see somebody helping over there.
[168:52.80]That person is real slow.
[169:00.47]Aiming at the sky.
[169:05.05]Blame the sticks.
[169:12.89]He's dead?
[169:13.41]No.
[169:17.92]Loot.
[169:21.83]Pro aim, no assistance.
[169:26.31]Gotta have... You have to have aim assist on for a console game like this.
[169:33.42]You'll move the sticks around until you're blue in the face.
[169:38.89]You best be dead, mister.
[169:43.80]Okay.
[169:46.44]Couple of chests.
[169:47.86]And then we can do that.
[169:48.72]And then we can go around.
[169:49.50]And then... Who's this?
[169:50.52]Oh, it's just a chair.
[169:51.68]Don't worry.
[169:56.39]30 FPS is all you need.
[169:59.83]Well, this is in 30 FPS.
[170:01.19]You need to walk in the door, John.
[170:10.44]Give this thing 60 FPS.
[170:11.60]Give it a coat of paint.
[170:14.52]Throw it on... PC.
[170:20.07]And you got a winner.
[170:22.91]My opinion.
[170:24.69]Save the game.
[170:25.69]Is it upstairs?
[170:30.48]Yes, it is.
[170:34.24]Let me see something here.
[170:37.64]Dusty Coat Rancher.
[170:38.72]Undead Hunter.
[170:44.00]Find and break the mythical unicorn is one of the things.
[170:51.71]Go back to the poncho.
[170:54.63]Rock store PC ports.
[170:59.07]Save it.
[171:02.15]GTA 5 was actually very good.
[171:04.65]They handled it extremely well.
[171:10.95]It's just too bad it took them like three years to make it.
[171:13.36]Or whatever it was.
[171:15.06]It took like, what, two years?
[171:16.24]Two or three years for it to come out on PC?
[171:17.48]It was like two years ago it came out?
[171:20.14]I don't even remember.
[171:27.51]Add some floppy disks, some extra terabytes, and you guys have a good computer game.
[171:36.77]Let's go!
[171:40.74]One more chest.
[171:44.43]Could be something good.
[171:49.93]Anything new?
[171:51.85]No.
[171:56.11]Got a Springfield rifle.
[171:57.95]Cool.
[171:59.89]Ooh, new shotgun.
[172:00.80]Sawed-off shotgun, double barrel.
[172:02.14]Well, the sawed-off is a new one, right?
[172:06.92]Stick with it.
[172:09.09]Let's go liberate another graveyard.
[172:10.59]You want the skin to be brought?
[172:16.01]Well, my hope is that... I mean, Red Dead Redemption 2 is going to be a huge fucking deal.
[172:23.90]It's gonna be a massive, massive deal.
[172:25.62]It's gonna be a huge game, a ton of stuff to do.
[172:29.58]It would be surely, surely, SURELY unfortunate if they didn't put it on PC.
[172:38.71]I know it's coming out for the Xbox One and the PS4 first.
[172:41.97]And I'm gonna play it on the PS4 first.
[172:46.35]But man, if they would just... Just wish they would do it.
[172:49.99]Is this cowboy month?
[173:05.97]I tried.
[173:06.81]Good luck, buddy.
[173:08.35]I didn't even need my help.
[173:09.27]He killed everybody.
[173:22.21]Come on.
[173:23.05]I know I can get up this.
[173:24.67]There we go.
[173:25.33]Alright, you need help?
[173:28.01]Got my experiments.
[173:36.87]So, wait.
[173:41.65]To offer help... To offer help and accept... I gotta, like, tie some people... Okay, let's do it.
[173:49.12]Tie up an undead, bring him to the doctor.
[173:50.50]Alright, fine.
[173:52.20]This sounds like fun.
[173:59.91]Need to find a horse of the apocalypse.
[174:01.33]I had pestilence, and I ghost-rid him into a lake.
[174:05.87]Accidentally.
[174:09.22]So, uh... That... I did have one.
[174:16.10]Let's go get one.
[174:21.36]Come on, let's go!
[174:25.50]Come on!
[174:33.00]I like this song.
[174:35.76]It's very eerie.
[174:37.16]Very well made.
[174:43.86]Let's go get an undead.
[174:45.20]Just find a random one.
[174:46.48]There's probably one sitting around here somewhere.
[174:49.12]Okay, when I need one, when I'm looking for one, they don't exist.
[174:51.65]But when I don't need one, they're everywhere.
[174:53.11]I guess that's such is life, right?
[174:59.27]Let me do this first.
[175:03.67]Is not just one undead just hanging out somewhere in here?
[175:05.67]There we go.
[175:15.95]I'm getting too far away from the doctor now.
[175:19.21]Please.
[175:20.17]You fucking little asshole.
[175:21.67]I'm not going to die, am I?
[175:26.07]Instantly?
[175:28.87]Well, I failed the challenge.
[175:30.37]That's fucking great.
[175:31.21]Cool.
[175:33.49]I ran too far away from the doctor because there were no zombies.
[175:36.68]So, that's just a wonderful, wonderful thing.
[175:41.82]I'm very happy about that.
[175:43.46]You know, I'm happy about it.
[175:49.08]Let's get this done so we can be done with this forever.
[175:56.21]Loser streamer.
[176:03.73]I can call pestilence again.
[176:04.97]I can?
[176:10.39]Really?
[176:14.74]Well, that's something I'm going to have to take a look at.
[176:19.17]laughing about it no I'm happy about it a little different a little different hmm
[176:48.60]Next to me?
[176:49.36]Nope.
[176:49.96]Not quite.
[176:51.66]He's one of those sprinters.
[177:00.55]Come up, you named zombie.
[177:04.55]Ah.
[177:25.39]Get my Mark Twain out of here.
[177:27.69]Stop it!
[177:54.96]These guys are so fucking annoying.
[177:59.30]Fucking huge fat lady just fucking knocked me over, it's over, I'm gonna lose.
[178:08.61]Then he says he's gonna lose!
[178:16.12]Jimmy, Jimmy Saint!
[178:24.51]He's spitting.
[178:32.85]Not on my watch.
[178:38.02]I win.
[178:38.32]Good game.
[178:47.82]I'm gonna have the time of my life.
[178:57.81]Okay, that was... scary.
[179:03.98]It's okay, we win.
[179:05.44]Mission complete.
[179:11.34]Okay, that guy sounded like Herman Munster.
[179:15.79]Look up Herman Munster talking.
[179:18.01]He's not gonna have the time of my life!
[179:25.32]He has this really, really weird laugh that I can't do, and I refuse to attempt it.
[179:32.29]That was a good Herman Munster impression.
[179:36.73]Can I jump this?
[179:37.27]Come on.
[179:38.01]Jump it.
[179:40.33]Can't jump it.
[179:49.65]Alright, now we wrap back down.
[179:53.39]I mean, I could do here.
[179:54.69]I could... I don't care.
[180:03.51]Let's just go.
[180:04.05]Let's just go to the mission.
[180:12.86]Look at my consumables.
[180:15.66]I have War Horse and Moonshine.
[180:21.94]Provisions.
[180:26.38]Undead horse heart.
[180:27.36]Like, no, I don't have.
[180:28.24]He's not here.
[180:28.68]I do not have him.
[180:37.58]Unfortunately, guys.
[180:44.39]Jerma monster.
[180:49.47]Don't have the consumable for pestilence.
[180:59.97]Hey, look who it is.
[181:02.01]My trusty steed.
[181:12.61]Come on.
[181:13.41]The undead horse would have done it.
[181:14.55]Don't make me kill you.
[181:16.90]You know I will.
[181:26.02]So... Where are the other horses?
[181:31.28]I feel like I've been going off-road for a little while.
[181:36.66]I mean, I've been off-road at least a few times now, and I haven't seen anything.
[181:42.48]They probably have their own designated areas, right?
[181:49.15]Some of them are up north, some are to the left, or whatever, right?
[181:54.17]Do I have food in my house?
[181:55.23]I do now, yes.
[181:56.05]I went grocery shopping.
[181:58.89]It's random, okay.
[182:09.72]I can look them up if I want to if they spawn in certain areas.
[182:16.88]How many hot dogs did I buy?
[182:18.24]None.
[182:19.59]I did not buy any hot dogs.
[182:27.69]No hot dogs.
[182:28.97]There's only really one specific brand of hot dogs that I like.
[182:40.95]I like all hot dogs.
[182:42.49]What a fucking lie.
[182:43.33]I'm not going to be one of those people that pretends that they don't eat hot dogs.
[182:46.83]No, hot dogs are disgusting.
[182:48.51]You know what's in them?
[182:49.45]Eyeballs and bones and ground up penises.
[182:52.66]Like, I don't care.
[182:53.96]Hot dogs are fucking delicious.
[182:55.08]And I will continue to eat them.
[183:03.52]Hey, someone's out there.
[183:05.32]He ain't one of them.
[183:06.28]Open the gate.
[183:12.79]You guys know that that's what is in hot dogs, right?
[183:18.18]Hot dogs are ground up eyeballs.
[183:20.54]Intestines and balls and stuff.
[183:24.61]It's true.
[183:25.09]That's a true statement.
[183:27.54]Hopefully this guy, I want this guy to be undead.
[183:29.54]Can't wait to see this guy as a zombie.
[183:31.58]That doesn't mean they're not delicious.
[183:44.30]That doesn't mean they're not good, but they're all kinds of weird shit ground up that you wouldn't normally, like, quote, eat.
[183:49.18]Hundred gold coins.
[183:49.58]That's a lot of money.
[183:50.52]Jesus.
[184:14.19]me sir yes sir would you care to demonstrate the undead defeating possibilities of this patented elixir no sir I would not what I would like is for you to stop peddling this nonsense right now who doesn't like a good fenway Frank rice well what price would you pay for survival
[184:36.84]No, he's got a golden gun!
[184:38.08]That means he's good with it.
[184:40.34]He must have unlocked that.
[184:42.02]Thanks a lot, John.
[185:03.53]These people have lost their families.
[185:05.49]They've lost everything.
[185:06.53]Well, that's not my fault.
[185:08.87]I'm just trying to make an honest living here.
[185:12.25]No, you're not.
[185:13.23]Well, okay.
[185:15.57]But can I help it if demand is high?
[185:18.25]High?
[185:19.26]I'm offering the people hope, John.
[185:21.24]That's a precious commodity.
[185:23.44]The tonic really works.
[185:25.50]These poor, awful, undead creatures can't stand it.
[185:28.52]They're all going to turn, I think.
[185:32.23]It's gonna have like undead human blood and that's why we're all gonna turn.
[185:39.89]That guy looks like he doesn't belong in this universe.
[185:43.49]That was just like a fucking dad.
[185:44.65]Okay.
[186:01.23]This is Westworld.
[186:02.69]Yeah, that's a guy that's at Westworld having fun.
[186:05.83]Oh, this is so cool.
[186:06.95]I love it here.
[186:08.56]Well, it wasn't quite what I expected.
[186:10.14]You're not supposed to hurt me.
[186:11.34]You're not supposed to hurt me.
[186:14.04]Well, I need more Desert Sage and Violet Snowdrop, and then I know I can cure this foul plague.
[186:23.81]Okay, back to doing your dirty work, am I?
[186:26.71]Now don't be like that.
[186:27.83]Do you remember the good times?
[186:30.33]Please?
[186:32.09]I'm an old man!
[186:36.34]Alright.
[186:37.58]Here.
[186:39.22]Take it.
[186:40.74]Maybe you can use it to attract some of them.
[186:45.18]Okay.
[186:46.50]I'll see what I can do.
[186:47.78]And thanks.
[186:49.66]Oh shit, it's another Stylen!
[186:52.26]Watch out, that thing's gonna blow!
[186:59.01]Boom!
[187:00.89]Why is he doing that with a Stylen grenade?
[187:08.00]Find five Desert Sage in Ga- No, we're not doing a World of Warcraft quest right now, are we?
[187:12.26]Are you serious?
[187:18.85]Okay.
[187:20.15]Undead bait.
[187:24.29]How much of it do I have?
[187:34.10]Okay.
[187:35.38]Well, it looks like we're going on an adventure.
[187:41.01]To where exactly?
[187:46.23]Um...
[187:49.06]What did it say it was?
[187:49.82]Well, let's go over here.
[187:53.55]We'll see how this works.
[188:05.60]The elixir is just bait.
[188:08.94]Do I have infinite amount of this?
[188:11.90]Yeah, I do.
[188:16.00]I have an unlimited supply of bait.
[188:19.78]Oh, no, I have four.
[188:20.86]Okay.
[188:24.17]Well, when I scrolled over at that last time, there was not a number on it.
[188:34.34]Take it off, then.
[188:47.10]I'm just blind as usual.
[188:49.16]You sure?
[188:49.56]Yeah, number four was on the screen when I first scrolled over it.
[188:53.75]I don't think it said anything.
[188:55.83]Go look it up.
[188:56.33]Go look at the pod.
[189:01.60]Look, you know how cheap fucking extra virgin olive oil is?
[189:05.30]It's alright.
[189:05.72]I can always get more.
[189:18.85]You can buff your mini-map.
[189:23.07]Hey, fucking red jacket, gold jacket, who gives a shit?
[189:26.06]I'm gonna save this town, okay.
[189:36.90]Get into the tower here.
[189:37.92]Out of the way.
[189:46.05]Holy shit, that hurt.
[189:54.49]No, just, I gotta shoot her in the head.
[189:55.73]Quick!
[190:03.07]Oof.
[190:03.27]Okay, that was close.
[190:05.72]What the fuck is that noise?
[190:09.54]Jesus.
[190:15.40]Get up there.
[190:21.34]I'm lying back.
[190:26.77]Alright, what do you need, mister?
[190:30.09]You need sniper rifle ammo.
[190:31.91]Sure, you can have that.
[190:34.39]Well, let's both snipe from the sniper roost.
[190:38.00]That sounds like a plan.
[190:38.90]I don't know what you're shooting at, but that's fine.
[190:45.06]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[190:45.80]Stay up there.
[190:49.46]Where is this?
[190:50.32]The town is back here.
[190:51.30]I don't see very many more zombies.
[190:58.06]Looks like this guy.
[191:05.00]He's dead?
[191:07.46]Another guy down there.
[191:15.04]That's by far the hardest thing to do in this game, is aiming that sniper at somebody.
[191:22.20]Okay, that didn't hit that.
[191:23.56]Alright, that's fine.
[191:26.26]I guess, I guess I didn't hit them.
[191:28.65]Sure.
[191:35.89]Platinum sniper.
[191:38.87]I'm gonna be honest though, I don't know how people aim like in a shooter on a console.
[191:43.28]I don't even know how it's fucking humanly possible.
[191:53.02]Let's do this.
[191:54.56]Can they climb up?
[191:55.72]No, they're too stupid.
[191:56.66]Actually, I'm going to do this.
[191:57.30]This is going to be fun.
[191:57.88]Ready?
[191:58.34]Ready?
[191:58.50]Watch this.
[192:02.92]Now check this out.
[192:03.48]Here they all come.
[192:07.73]Come on, get over here.
[192:08.43]Everybody get attracted.
[192:11.95]That didn't hit anyone.
[192:14.21]There we go.
[192:19.35]What did I ever do to be a defendant and worship the Lord?
[192:22.84]Burn!
[192:23.28]There's a lot of them on fire.
[192:30.01]Did they die?
[192:30.59]Are they going to burn from this?
[192:32.01]Yeah, they're good.
[192:36.01]Okay.
[192:36.61]Now I can just take the rest out.
[192:40.58]Get some precision aiming.
[192:42.04]I can't.
[192:45.92]Okay, I'm just going to put that down.
[193:06.36]Any more?
[193:07.30]One more over there.
[193:09.32]Precision.
[193:10.03]Red face.
[193:10.45]Alright.
[193:24.46]Beats Red Dead Redemption on stream.
[193:26.42]What will they do next?
[193:30.37]I have a long list of games that I'm ready to play.
[193:36.11]I have a lot of things to play on stream.
[193:39.20]We got like... We got like two months worth of games to play.
[193:47.09]He's like a director.
[193:48.93]Not yet.
[193:49.11]Trying to help my family.
[193:50.51]Done streaming after two months.
[193:52.21]No.
[194:11.85]Brilliant.
[194:13.17]Man turned against man.
[194:15.41]Kind-hearted neighbors turned into savage, flesh-eating monsters.
[194:25.24]Who would enjoy that?
[194:28.48]What kind of sick person would like that?
[194:32.26]My kind sir.
[194:35.53]The lowest common denominator.
[194:41.03]Wait, the sound is off again?
[194:45.34]I thought I fixed that earlier.
[194:46.30]You're a smart fellow.
[194:48.10]Allow you to inhumanate.
[194:53.18]Listen, Mr. Marston.
[194:55.10]What I need is one of those nasty buggers that spits poisonous snot on you.
[195:01.87]If in your travels you can find a spare one, we can make moving picture history.
[195:08.77]You're worse than they are.
[195:10.63]Each to their own, Mr. Marston.
[195:14.19]Alright.
[195:30.56]Capture a retcher from Gaptooth Ridge and bring it back to McKenna.
[195:38.52]First, I'm going to loot the shit out of your tents.
[195:42.15]I deserve it.
[195:47.30]Sniper rifle.
[195:48.62]What else do we got?
[195:50.00]Keep the Springfield on.
[195:50.94]Anything else?
[195:57.65]Nope.
[196:02.37]Wait a minute.
[196:04.39]Hold on.
[196:04.89]Is this a watchable movie?
[196:12.90]Do I actually get to watch a movie?
[196:14.58]Oh, this is going to be fantastic.
[196:15.74]I can't wait.
[196:20.03]Okay.
[196:22.36]Gaptooth Ridge.
[196:26.04]So we gotta go up here.
[196:31.70]Gaptooth Ridge!
[196:34.56]Another fetch quest.
[196:35.40]I think I have to go up to Gaptooth Ridge anyways, don't I?
[196:44.08]Oh, let's try to kill two birds with one stone here.
[196:50.96]We need a spitter and we need flowers or something, right?
[197:00.09]Bolt action is better than the Springfield.
[197:02.35]I'll try it for a little while.
[197:04.83]I'll give it a go for a little while.
[197:05.78]Why not?
[197:16.47]I need a spitter.
[197:18.71]Even if they lasso, are they going to spit on me?
[197:20.25]Is that going to be a problem?
[197:26.47]Okay, I think this is the one right there.
[197:29.70]No, what is this?
[197:31.30]These ones are on fire.
[197:33.08]No, they don't have heads!
[197:34.02]They don't have heads!
[197:36.40]Come on, no!
[197:37.68]Don't do this shit.
[197:39.30]They don't have heads.
[197:45.14]Great.
[197:50.21]Should I just reload right now?
[197:52.11]Right?
[197:52.39]I should, right?
[197:54.53]God damn it.
[198:02.79]I mean... I might be able to... Can I just capture one of these people up here and like collect the thing and then come back?
[198:13.63]Will it reset it?
[198:14.25]I mean, I can't... Can I do anything?
[198:16.62]Is what I'm asking.
[198:17.48]Or do I have to restart the game?
[198:28.35]Do you own the game?
[198:37.03]Well, this is the Xbox Game of the Year edition.
[198:40.27]And it's being backwards compatibility ran on the Xbox One.
[198:44.37]So I'm assuming all the problems that could happen... I have to.
[198:48.87]Okay, well.
[198:50.82]Alright.
[198:54.16]Okay.
[198:56.74]Let's just go back here.
[199:06.47]Just hard reset the whole game?
[199:10.41]I don't think I'm going to have to do that.
[199:11.71]Happens in the PS4 as well.
[199:28.90]You wish this happened in GTA.
[199:31.96]Pedestrians to walk around with no heads.
[199:39.78]I don't think I... I didn't even loot this one.
[199:48.09]Peter.
[199:48.87]Okay.
[199:50.33]Alright.
[199:51.47]Back to Gaptooth Ridge.
[199:52.51]Somewhere over there.
[199:55.71]Here we go.
[200:00.80]Let's do it.
[200:06.06]Make our way out of here.
[200:08.99]I wish this happened in real life.
[200:10.25]Imagine you just woke up one day and you didn't have a head.
[200:15.03]But you were fine.
[200:17.05]That means you can't talk.
[200:18.65]You can't see.
[200:20.21]You can't hear.
[200:20.83]That would be fucking awful.
[200:25.37]You could move.
[200:26.39]You could move your body around.
[200:32.12]All of your senses would be taken from you.
[200:33.78]Well, you'd still have, like, sense of touch.
[200:43.83]But you must scream.
[200:44.63]Yeah, I have no mouth, but I must scream.
[200:51.70]All you have is touch and pain.
[200:57.22]You can't have a sense of touch without the brain.
[200:59.70]You know, that's true.
[201:01.58]So what would you even be?
[201:02.66]You'd be able to walk, though.
[201:06.29]Would you even know that you were walking?
[201:08.69]You know, because you wouldn't be able to feel your feet touching the ground.
[201:16.12]What's the matter?
[201:18.34]There's a safe town, sure.
[201:20.68]Let's go.
[201:24.22]Come on up.
[201:25.52]Escort her to the town safely.
[201:28.92]Which town would that be?
[201:30.02]That one.
[201:33.16]Can you wait, like, a few minutes?
[201:35.57]Can we do this first?
[201:38.33]Just come with me on this mission.
[201:41.63]I just have to find a couple of flowers.
[201:44.57]Oh, shit.
[201:45.19]Wait a minute.
[201:48.40]There's not enough room on the horse.
[201:54.45]I, like, need to capture a spitter.
[201:56.31]Okay, well, I gotta, like, pick up some... I'm, like, seeing them pop up.
[202:02.41]I gotta get off the horse and get them.
[202:09.58]Here we are.
[202:10.00]We're on an herb adventure now.
[202:18.21]I need five of something from here, right?
[202:31.57]Okay, got to shoot him in the head.
[202:32.75]He's a zombie dog.
[202:34.60]Alright, herb adventure.
[202:42.50]We're in the gulch.
[202:44.16]Is that a spitter?
[202:44.70]We need to find a spitter.
[202:48.36]That's not a spitter.
[202:49.06]That's a charger.
[202:54.20]They glow like green, right?
[202:56.47]Oh, whatever.
[202:56.83]Let's just go here.
[203:04.87]Cowboy uber.
[203:14.19]This is like...
[203:19.25]I love that she's being silent.
[203:22.61]She's not saying a word.
[203:23.61]Yeah, this is okay.
[203:26.29]Thanks for taking me out here.
[203:32.80]What do these things look like?
[203:35.08]Not the spitters, the herb that I need.
[203:45.28]I feel like I know what the herb looks like.
[203:47.92]No, I mean like the spit herb.
[203:48.96]Ah, I think... No, it's just one of the idiots running around.
[204:01.35]Saving.
[204:06.57]Saving for what?
[204:12.26]Take her on a scream ride?
[204:15.03]Well, to do that, I just have to ghost ride the horse off a cliff.
[204:17.05]But, I mean, I kind of don't want to do that, do I?
[204:21.40]The white flowers?
[204:22.40]Okay.
[204:24.46]Hmm.
[204:29.74]There's nothing on the map to show where the other one is, huh?
[204:36.37]Is it to aimlessly wander around until I find them?
[204:39.11]Is that it right there?
[204:43.03]Looks like it.
[204:47.66]Is that what I need?
[204:51.59]Wild Feverfew.
[205:02.23]You good?
[205:04.82]Don't go that far, horse.
[205:05.86]Come on.
[205:08.22]Not the right flower.
[205:09.14]Alright, come on up.
[205:19.07]Spitter?
[205:19.55]No.
[205:23.93]You wait till they stand and get him right in the head.
[205:30.52]Okay.
[205:32.26]What?
[205:32.44]I don't know why that took so long.
[205:38.82]Alright.
[205:41.08]Let's just go.
[205:44.44]I need to go back to Seth, right?
[205:49.62]I need a spitter though.
[205:50.52]I'm dumping this girl.
[205:57.39]I feel like this spitter quest is gonna be really fucking irritating.
[206:14.55]Alright, yeah, get off the horse.
[206:16.46]You made it.
[206:17.54]Excuse me?
[206:18.14]Okay.
[206:18.42]That sounds interesting, thank you.
[206:21.50]I ran her over.
[206:43.69]Alright, Spitter.
[206:46.39]He told me to come up here.
[206:48.41]Gaptooth Ridge.
[206:51.67]I'm going to give this one more once around and then I'm not going to care.
[206:53.81]I'm just going back to south.
[206:54.63]Alright, what about... Let's just make our way this way through Gaptooth Ridge.
[207:08.64]And I'll liberate this town and see what happens.
[207:16.85]Think of your wife.
[207:21.20]She would have given you a month's room.
[207:27.12]But this is a family-friendly stream.
[207:29.92]We don't resort to stuff like that.
[207:31.74]We don't resort to talking about dirty, dirty, dirty, dirtiness.
[207:39.85]We don't resort to that.
[207:47.80]Family friendly.
[207:50.32]Parental guidance.
[207:51.12]What is that one?
[207:57.77]I don't... I'm not picking it up.
[208:00.71]There's too many fucking people there.
[208:04.59]Holy shit.
[208:06.69]Did not see that one coming.
[208:15.73]He just resorts to Garfield porn.
[208:19.23]Garfield porn.
[208:20.27]Just saying those two things together just don't belong together.
[208:24.85]They don't.
[208:25.93]Those two words do not deserve to be next to each other.
[208:33.12]They just really don't.
[208:38.04]Khan's under attack.
[208:44.20]Let's liberate.
[208:49.74]Right down there.
[208:51.38]That's a fall I can't do.
[208:52.52]Look at how fucking huge this place is.
[208:54.54]Gosh darn.
[208:56.02]This is gonna take a while.
[209:07.97]God damn it.
[209:12.61]What the fuck?
[209:14.87]What the fuck?
[209:16.13]Easy.
[209:18.05]We just cross-checked each other.
[209:20.81]Jesus.
[209:23.95]That was not cool.
[209:25.06]And how do I get up on this?
[209:34.68]Oh, shit.
[209:43.39]What the fuck?
[209:50.93]No, not the fucking lasso, you dummy.
[210:01.19]God.
[210:04.55]Spinner!
[210:05.35]Don't kill that guy.
[210:11.60]I swear to God, he lit me on fire, too.
[210:14.92]Fuck that guy.
[210:20.51]There's so many of these sprinters.
[210:24.32]These things are the worst.
[210:27.24]I gotta get a- What the f- I can- you can do a dodge roll?
[210:31.68]I have not done a dodge roll the entire time I played this game.
[210:35.63]How did I do that?
[210:40.37]There's a lot of spinners, okay.
[210:47.85]Finally.
[210:48.25]Alright, do not kill all those... Sometimes... Sometimes, John, you just... You handle... I don't have an answer for you why that's happening.
[211:01.63]I have fucking no idea.
[211:03.29]No, we're not gonna... We're gonna tie that guy up and hide him back here.
[211:12.58]Get that fucking spit on.
[211:19.11]There's two spinners here.
[211:20.55]Get rid of this one.
[211:24.69]No, not on it.
[211:25.89]No!
[211:27.43]John!
[211:28.89]John.
[211:29.83]Okay, John.
[211:30.69]Look.
[211:37.58]Fucking controls in this game sometimes really make me want to scream into a fucking pillow.
[211:58.52]Fuck over here.
[211:59.13]Come here.
[212:00.17]Got him.
[212:20.55]Okay.
[212:21.59]We're getting there.
[212:25.69]He's coming with me.
[212:26.49]Get up here.
[212:27.27]I gotta, like, pick this guy up.
[212:31.96]Come up here where it's safe.
[212:39.48]I don't want you to accidentally die from somebody shooting at you.
[212:42.48]Come with me in the house.
[212:44.01]Oh, no.
[212:45.11]You don't... Stop kicking him!
[212:49.65]Stop stomping him, please.
[212:54.01]Gotta drop him, like, over here in the corner, right there.
[212:59.00]And he's safe.
[213:06.89]Here we go.
[213:18.80]I don't want to go that far away.
[213:19.84]Is he going to despawn or anything?
[213:23.63]Oh, you fucking game.
[213:25.73]Like, I walked five feet.
[213:27.71]I walked like five feet out the door.
[213:30.95]And he's gone.
[213:31.39]I walked out the door and he's gone.
[213:43.40]He escaped.
[213:43.96]He escaped out of his bombs.
[213:47.88]Fantastic.
[213:50.71]That's fab- Oh, I'm unhappy.
[213:52.97]I'm unhappy.
[214:00.44]I hope there's another spitter there.
[214:01.82]Okay, that might be the same one.
[214:06.82]I'm gonna let that guy live.
[214:07.70]Because I don't want him to disappear again.
[214:19.37]Charger right here.
[214:22.81]Sooner or later it'll be done and I can steal him.
[214:28.37]Another Spitter.
[214:29.25]Good.
[214:32.77]One more person has to die.
[214:35.98]Alright.
[214:36.62]Kill the remaining zombies.
[214:38.94]Except for that one.
[214:41.00]Leave the rest.
[214:42.24]Don't let them get away.
[214:49.47]Don't!
[214:50.41]Wait a minute.
[214:51.77]Wait a minute.
[214:52.07]Wait a minute.
[214:52.35]Wait a minute.
[214:52.65]Wait a minute.
[214:52.99]Wait a minute.
[214:53.31]Don't.
[214:55.05]Come here.
[214:55.33]Come here.
[214:55.63]Come here.
[214:55.87]Come here.
[214:56.07]Come here.
[214:56.33]Come here.
[214:57.71]Got one.
[215:02.65]Guy with the gun on the roof, do not blow this.
[215:15.10]There is one more?
[215:18.61]Who are these people?
[215:26.91]Alright.
[215:33.10]We're gonna carry her all the way over here.
[215:36.10]I don't care.
[215:39.26]She's gone.
[215:39.70]I would be so angry.
[215:47.25]What are these guys doing all the way up here?
[215:49.45]There's like two zombies just hanging out.
[215:58.95]Where?
[216:02.77]Alright.
[216:05.68]Where's my horse?
[216:06.30]Where's the horse?
[216:09.28]Put it down.
[216:17.54]Is my horse too stupid to get up here by himself?
[216:30.99]Alright, good.
[216:35.03]You must choose, the horse or the girl.
[216:38.60]Ride horse.
[216:41.22]Here they come.
[216:48.33]I think I just hit him in the arm twice.
[216:49.59]I did.
[216:50.01]Well, that guy's gonna super die.
[216:52.39]Okay.
[216:54.75]Saving.
[216:55.05]Look at it.
[216:55.41]Got it.
[216:57.79]Town has been saved.
[216:59.13]Hooray.
[217:01.35]Now we can bring this person back.
[217:03.03]Let me just get this... Looks like... There's chests here.
[217:10.26]I'm gonna go up and get this one up here.
[217:20.79]Grab the one... There's one chest here.
[217:22.28]There's a survivor.
[217:22.92]Is it a survivor or a bad guy?
[217:24.14]I don't know.
[217:29.98]Okay, you sit right here.
[217:36.26]I'll be back in a second.
[217:37.36]I just want to press this button.
[217:41.65]Look, if I stare at her, she doesn't disappear, right?
[217:46.41]Wait, this is not a chest.
[217:47.47]What is this?
[217:52.07]What?
[217:55.17]What is going on?
[217:59.73]What did that do?
[218:03.89]I'm doing something up there.
[218:05.39]I don't know.
[218:05.81]Whatever.
[218:10.37]That's just what I need.
[218:35.93]What are you doing moving around?
[218:37.59]Ugh.
[219:01.87]Why?
[219:02.07]Because the undead version's better.
[219:03.66]The undead version doesn't run away and disappear people.
[219:11.22]I had to open the chest.
[219:12.67]Guess what?
[219:13.25]If I didn't open the chest, you know, all you motherfuckers in chat would be like, You missed the chest!
[219:18.31]You missed the chest!
[219:19.41]Kill him!
[219:20.31]Kill him!
[219:21.71]Kill the streamer!
[219:22.74]I had to open that chest.
[219:29.39]And yes, I just did like an old man voice crack, and I'm fucking proud of it.
[219:38.93]You're not wrong.
[219:39.63]Oh, this sucks.
[219:44.66]And so does this, by the way.
[219:51.76]Undead.
[219:52.60]Undead!
[219:54.56]He's undead!
[219:58.04]No, just fucking go near a town.
[219:59.88]I don't fucking know.
[220:00.66]I'm so fucking mad right now that I lost that thing.
[220:10.49]Streamer, you missed a cliff.
[220:11.65]Should have walked back with body.
[220:14.75]Where am I fucking going?
[220:16.45]Did it save after that?
[220:17.27]It did, right?
[220:20.73]The last checkpoint was when I liberated that town.
[220:23.61]That's fine.
[220:31.29]That huge pain in the ass that that was.
[220:41.25]Now I have dynamite.
[220:43.98]I want to bury this axe in this person's head right now.
[220:52.00]But I'm not going to.
[220:52.62]We just gotta go.
[220:53.16]Let's go.
[220:59.74]We're just gonna do the regular mission.
[221:01.23]So we're gonna have to miss out on the funny mission probably.
[221:04.05]Because I had two tied up spitters.
[221:11.35]And both of them disappeared.
[221:13.55]For reasons that I cannot immediately explain.
[221:16.10]I cannot immediately explain to you why that happened.
[221:22.48]At least I got the chest.
[221:29.88]And, like, the horse is back.
[221:30.84]We just, we've rewound.
[221:31.88]The time rewound.
[221:32.76]We're fine.
[221:33.20]Here's Desert Sage.
[221:37.12]He says, I need this, like, for Desert Sage.
[221:41.26]Well, we, we aren't going to do that.
[221:42.98]What we're going to do is, we're going to, we're just going to teleport to McFarland Ranch.
[221:52.03]And we're going to continue the goddamn story.
[222:01.78]Why is the DLC so... The main game had glitches and strange bugs.
[222:06.88]But some of these seem fairly game-breaking.
[222:09.26]Where am I going?
[222:10.46]I can teleport from here.
[222:14.40]This is buggy, buggy... Bad bugs.
[222:16.76]Not funny bugs.
[222:17.60]Not good bugs.
[222:18.48]Bad bugs.
[222:19.48]Like wasps.
[222:22.74]Like a praying mantis is a funny bug.
[222:25.34]This DLC is a fucking... Oversized wasp.
[222:33.42]Alright, where's the safe?
[222:34.48]Is it downstairs or upstairs?
[222:41.85]Where's the bed?
[222:42.37]Is it downstairs?
[222:53.83]Don't be dead.
[222:54.83]Okay.
[222:57.17]Where's the bed?
[222:59.17]There it is.
[222:59.65]Fucking wasps.
[223:10.99]Where's McFarlane Ranch?
[223:12.27]McFarlane Ranch.
[223:13.33]I can't go to McFarlane Ranch.
[223:16.23]So, I guess I have to go to... Is Hennigan's Steed on there?
[223:22.27]Thieves?
[223:22.51]I don't think I have anything that's close to this.
[223:23.91]I have to go to, like, Armadillo.
[223:30.04]Oh, Thieves Landing is close enough.
[223:36.78]Thank you, Boneless Bacon, for the five dollars.
[223:40.76]Again, thank you for the five bucks.
[223:42.36]Did you know that if you eat shit, it comes back out as food?
[223:45.78]Why did I read that?
[223:46.98]Like, I... The fucking... Stellar comment.
[223:54.61]What are you talking about?
[223:56.31]You paid five dollars to say that.
[223:59.75]Alright, now I think... Now I do think it's funny.
[224:04.46]Because, like... Why...
[224:08.82]Help!
[224:10.60]I got this!
[224:11.16]Fucking zombie!
[224:14.63]I got him.
[224:22.67]Please, take this!
[224:23.55]Alright, what are you gonna give me?
[224:29.69]Revolver ammo.
[224:32.58]Thanks.
[224:46.88]Thanks for the ammo!
[224:50.26]Come here, lightning!
[224:52.62]That was just a little quickie.
[224:55.56]Alright, thieves landing.
[225:01.01]Let's go.
[225:02.63]Still haven't seen another warhorse.
[225:04.49]Another scary horse.
[225:09.71]We just gotta get to S.
[225:17.56]The dead guy gave you more ammo than she did.
[225:21.36]Chaotic Evil Kermit.
[225:26.85]I love that.
[225:32.11]That's fucking great.
[225:34.92]No, it would be Chaotic Neutral.
[225:36.54]It wouldn't be Chaotic Evil.
[225:40.92]Chaotic Evil would be, I only do awful, terrible things.
[225:44.74]I've been liberating towns, I've been saving people, I've been helping people.
[225:48.49]Chaotic Neutral.
[225:54.89]He's taught them how to play musical instruments.
[226:09.97]Well, Seth, sorry to interrupt your party.
[226:13.42]Hey, John, come join us.
[226:15.16]We're having a jig.
[226:16.86]John, have you met Mary Lou?
[226:18.92]What about Francie?
[226:20.46]I did as you asked and cleared out the rest of the graveyards.
[226:24.06]Doesn't seem to have done much good.
[226:26.40]Good?
[226:27.49]Good?
[226:28.47]Good?
[226:31.01]Is Dad good?
[226:33.47]Are you good?
[226:36.31]Stop with your nonsense, you annoying fool.

[227:03.80]Are you constipated, John?
[227:05.52]You look very angry.
[227:06.96]You get constipated when you're angry.
[227:08.90]Yes, you do.
[227:09.54]I'm warning you, Seth.
[227:12.22]I'm warning you, Seth.
[227:13.68]I'm warning you.
[227:15.06]Don't play with the undead, Seth.
[227:19.16]Don't waste your time searching for treasure and discover only a glass eye.
[227:23.92]Glass eye.
[227:26.18]Well, warn all you want, cowboy.
[227:31.00]He just ate the... Okay.
[227:33.07]Well, that's... He just killed himself.
[227:36.65]No.
[227:36.75]That would have been funny if he just died.
[227:41.01]Seth!
[227:58.33]They gave like the worst character in the whole game.
[228:02.07]The most stuff.
[228:03.90]In the DLC.
[228:04.28]I fucking hated this guy in the regular game.
[228:06.42]You're a sick man.
[228:25.27]Boneless bacon again.
[228:26.23]Thank you for the five dollars again.
[228:27.81]And you say, if peanut butter cookies are made from peanut butter, then what are Girl Scout cookies made out of?
[228:38.22]Peanut butter.
[228:44.58]What am I supposed to do now?
[228:45.94]Uh, over here.
[228:51.19]Okay.
[228:52.77]Looks like we've run out of shit to do.
[228:59.30]Should we give him the juice?
[229:05.87]Alright, let's throw a boomer bile on him and see what happens.
[229:25.70]Now he's got his gun out.
[229:29.11]Looking for me Where's he going?
[229:38.54]Okay, well Free food boys free food Get the get the free food on the ground free food.
[229:52.82]Oh
[229:59.48]It happened.
[230:02.28]I'm dead.
[230:02.56]Okay.
[230:19.27]Whatever.
[230:25.71]I thought that shit is supposed to track zombies.
[230:29.49]I threw it on the ground and it didn't do anything.
[230:31.01]They all just started running after me.
[230:35.31]Should I be surprised?
[230:37.91]The guy that makes fake tonic waters and shit, his item doesn't do anything?
[230:43.92]Why am I surprised?
[231:04.16]Get up there.
[231:26.64]Be careful.
[231:28.60]It's the thing in the fucking world.
[231:31.12]It's the thing on the ground.
[231:34.00]I thought it was my fault.
[231:34.94]I thought it was my problem.
[231:36.36]It ain't my problem.
[231:37.30]It's not my problem.
[231:38.00]It's the fucking thing in the ground that's doing that.
[231:41.02]Take a look.
[231:42.14]You want to do some fucking examinations?
[231:44.70]Watch this.
[231:47.30]Look at this.
[231:47.60]It's the thing in the ground.
[231:54.19]Not my fault.
[231:55.61]Watch.
[231:58.23]It's this thing right in the ground right here.
[232:01.19]Boink.
[232:02.82]It makes you move.
[232:06.32]Take a look back at that.
[232:07.46]My horse like jams to the right.
[232:11.84]That's not my fault.
[232:17.81]Clip it.
[232:18.07]Somebody clip it.
[232:18.53]Clip it.
[232:18.81]Alright, look.
[232:28.27]She's okay, right?
[232:31.56]No, she's a zombie now.
[232:32.52]Okay, well, I tried.
[232:33.78]At least I tried.
[232:39.62]Just go back and watch the clip.
[232:40.84]If somebody gets it.
[232:41.60]You'll see.
[232:42.46]Like, my horse fucking hits a bump and rips to the right.
[232:47.04]Let's go!
[232:48.76]Go watch it!
[232:49.44]Go watch it right now!
[232:50.34]I can wait.
[232:51.30]I can wait.
[232:51.68]Give me this fucking clip.
[232:59.38]It's this thing right in the ground right here.
[233:02.36]Boink.
[233:03.34]No, that's not the one I'm talking about.
[233:04.74]I'm talking about the one before that.
[233:06.66]It didn't do anything.
[233:07.58]It doesn't do anything.
[233:10.44]Why am I surprised?
[233:15.44]Yeah, I like clipped through the fucking ground.
[233:19.32]Look at that.
[233:21.82]What is fucking ripping my horse through, clipping through the ground?
[233:30.39]Fucking bullshit.
[233:35.12]I can wait.
[233:36.06]I can wait.
[233:37.14]Say it again.
[233:40.42]No.
[233:40.86]Okay.
[233:41.28]We're done with that one.
[233:49.20]That happened two separate times.
[233:51.49]The first time, I ran off.
[233:53.81]I did.
[233:54.15]The second time, I hit a fucking bump in the ledge and flipped off.
[234:02.29]It was all Seth's fault.
[234:12.35]Okay, I'm done clicking on fucking clips.
[234:17.13]This fucking glitchy ass game.
[234:35.60]Just angrily mashing A. I forgot I'm not on an undead horse.
[234:42.78]That wasn't a fucking glitch.
[234:44.00]That was me mashing A because I forgot I'm not on an undead horse.
[235:02.57]No, I'm telling you right now.
[235:04.51]I fell off the horse because I was mashing A. That second time I hit a fucking bump in the road and my horse went...
[235:14.44]And it's angering me.
[235:15.52]It's making me extremely upset.
[235:22.04]Gotta clear the town first.
[235:27.59]It's a pretty big town.
[235:35.70]Can I climb this one?
[235:39.59]Yes, I can.
[235:39.97]It's going to be you and me up here.
[235:41.85]We're going to be safe.
[235:43.71]Take the shotgun.
[235:44.97]Take five for Peter.
[235:48.09]Let's do some shooting.
[235:56.58]Shall we?
[236:00.88]You're fucking up my shooting.
[236:03.19]I swear to God.
[236:15.12]How many more we got?
[236:17.78]I kind of just need to move.
[236:19.62]Yeah.
[236:20.26]See what the rest of the town needs.
[236:22.76]What do you need?
[236:30.32]What do you need?
[236:34.08]Here, take it.
[236:35.04]You're welcome.
[236:38.36]Well, you're welcome would be nice.
[236:49.00]This town is really empty of zombies I will say.
[236:59.71]There are enough to kill them.
[237:02.11]She just dodged out of the way and that one went through her hair.
[237:12.15]He's walking towards the fire.
[237:13.21]He's gonna burn.
[237:14.61]Don't need to shoot this guy.
[237:15.69]Don't waste the ammo.
[237:31.16]Where are you going?
[237:32.46]That's a dog.
[237:34.10]It's a zombie dog though.
[237:43.45]Saloon.
[237:44.05]Get the dog.
[237:52.52]No, don't get the dog.
[238:01.96]One more.
[238:02.36]Then we can finish this.
[238:11.85]Final one.
[238:13.05]Where is he?
[238:13.51]Right here.
[238:19.98]Killed, remaining undead.
[238:20.90]Here they come!
[238:23.34]Let's make this easy on myself.
[238:29.10]Just give it up!
[238:44.65]Liberated!
[238:53.75]How much more is in the game?
[238:54.87]I feel like I have a round of missions to do.
[238:58.97]Am I getting like near the end of the DLC?
[239:07.53]Or do I need to open up another zone or something?
[239:12.96]Gotta do Mexico too.
[239:17.45]My pants are just on fire.
[239:23.77]Just walking around with pants on fire.
[239:33.96]Over here.
[239:38.62]Lots of chests here.
[239:48.49]Inside.
[239:49.15]Anybody playing blackjack right now?
[239:59.26]I actually have to get the flower stuff.
[240:01.12]I do.
[240:01.38]I thought that was just sort of an optional... Do it if you'd like.
[240:07.08]That's how you get more of said item.
[240:08.92]I don't know.
[240:09.36]It was a necessity.
[240:11.62]It is then, huh?
[240:20.74]I only have one of those guns, huh?
[240:37.91]Well, let's continue.
[240:40.58]Do the movie thing?
[240:41.62]I really would have loved to do the movie thing.
[240:44.02]Okay.
[240:49.18]Nice to see you too, Miss McFarlane.
[240:51.18]Oh, I thought you'd be dead.
[240:52.34]I heard things were bad in West Elizabeth.
[240:56.16]Sure.
[240:56.40]Yeah, it is sad that Red Dead Redemption 2 got delayed.
[240:59.50]Would have been coming out this year, right?
[241:03.53]Like in a few months.
[241:05.63]Both, I fear.
[241:06.75]How's your father?
[241:07.95]Fine and dandy.
[241:09.55]He should be coming out of that barn any moment now.
[241:12.53]Daddy!
[241:14.71]What's he doing in the barn?
[241:16.89]Daddy, John's here!
[241:20.95]It's gonna be a zombie.
[241:26.13]What was he doing in the barn?
[241:28.69]Just rounding up the undead and keeping them safe so the rest of us can go about our business.
[241:33.72]No, I'm good.
[241:34.30]He's a real man.
[241:35.44]Somebody was saying to take a... I don't have to finish it.
[241:38.82]I've been going for four hours.
[241:40.60]No, I'm good.
[241:44.20]I'm good for at least another hour or two.
[241:45.68]I'll be good.
[241:47.50]Not long.
[241:49.58]Only since...
[241:53.44]He is absolutely an undead minion at this point.
[242:05.72]Hey, happy to catch one of your streams.
[242:07.00]I've seen them all on YouTube.
[242:08.42]Well, what's going on, Slippy?
[242:10.69]Welcome to the stream.
[242:16.41]Look for him in the barn.
[242:20.64]He's gonna be a bad guy.
[242:21.78]I can feel it.
[242:26.34]Oh, not this again.
[242:27.14]Remember this exact same scenario?
[242:29.32]I had an issue climbing up this?
[242:33.53]It's gonna happen again.
[242:34.35]I can promise you that.
[242:37.95]Wow.
[242:38.67]No, it's not.
[242:43.51]I thought I was in trouble.
[242:44.73]Huh?
[242:48.40]Huh?
[242:54.79]Alright, like... The fucking movement in this game.
[243:03.36]You gotta give me some credit.
[243:04.50]Those of you guys that have played this game.
[243:07.26]Sometimes, like, the movement just don't make any fucking sense.
[243:11.10]You, like, spin around in circles to do anything.
[243:18.54]Why did they want me to do that?
[243:20.86]He's, like, right here.
[243:24.11]I don't understand what's going on here.
[243:29.66]Sometimes if I want to turn around, John Marston will spin in a fucking circle and run in a different direction.
[243:41.09]It's like the worst part of this whole game.
[244:06.47]John, you can't control me, Marsden.
[244:13.34]Yeah, it is... It has that slippery, like, sloppy feeling.
[244:17.82]It reminds me of a fucking Tomb Raider.
[244:19.52]Like, for instance, right now, I'm not pressing any fucking buttons.
[244:22.12]He's just deciding he's gonna glitch the fuck out and spin around.
[244:27.33]Clear the barn of the undead.
[244:28.67]I will try.
[244:29.17]I will not complain about this game.
[244:45.53]That's my only complaint of the whole game, really.
[244:48.57]Is how awful, awful, awful, awful, awful the movement of the main playable character is.
[244:56.36]Sometimes it's just like, come on man, what the fuck is this?
[245:06.05]I was gonna be so angry if I died.
[245:09.09]There he is.
[245:14.70]I'll go pick up a gun on the side.
[245:22.36]Oh shit, I don't have any guns.
[245:23.98]I gotta go grab one.
[245:38.31]See you later.
[245:43.31]Chewing tobacco.
[245:44.01]He has a mouthful of tobacco.
[245:45.16]That's fine.
[245:50.44]Well, the barn doors are barred.
[245:52.16]I can't do anything about that.
[245:53.12]So we're going to have to climb back up and out?
[245:58.96]I should have tied him up.
[245:59.90]Where am I going to bring him?
[246:00.68]I can't leave.
[246:05.51]Speaking of leaving, do I have to go up the top?
[246:09.87]I guess.
[246:15.79]This will kill me, so don't be a fucking idiot here.
[246:22.34]Perfect.
[246:24.28]And we just gotta go to Bonnie.
[246:28.34]And continue our mission.
[246:32.98]John, do I have to master...
[246:38.78]I'm good.
[246:39.53]It already saved, so... Bonnie, I'm so sorry.
[246:56.40]I think I lost connection.
[246:58.38]No, I'm still here.
[246:59.72]Well, John, you always do bring sunshine to my life.
[247:05.04]I'm sorry about your father.
[247:09.43]John Game sucks Marston.
[247:39.09]The game doesn't suck.
[247:40.63]The game's very good.
[247:41.39]The game's exceptional.
[247:55.98]John's slippery, Marston.
[248:03.59]Alright.
[248:07.17]So you guys are saying that I have to go collect the herbs or something, right?
[248:14.11]Because I have nothing else to do.
[248:15.11]I'm at a standstill.
[248:28.90]And there's no cell phone for somebody to call me.
[248:30.58]Remember in GTA when you had ran out of shit to do and you got to call on your cell phone?
[248:35.36]That's what I'm expecting right now.
[248:39.26]There's no cell phones in the Wild West, so how the fuck is somebody gonna tell me where to go next?
[248:48.18]I had to go to Tall Trees.
[248:51.36]And I could liberate the rest of the towns, right?
[249:00.65]Tall Trees it is, I guess.
[249:10.40]Telegram.
[249:11.46]Well, but if it was a telegram, they'd be at my house.
[249:15.08]Some guy right now is ringing my doorbell and I'm not there.
[249:25.17]Horse, listen to me, please.
[249:29.91]I've done this before a thousand times.
[249:31.71]I know how to make it so you won't die.
[249:33.14]Trust me.
[249:42.53]Now I gotta go this way.
[249:43.87]What's the fastest way to get up there?
[249:46.63]That way.
[249:52.64]Easy.
[249:53.46]I don't think there's a train.
[249:59.20]Well now we're in emote only mode.
[250:00.84]Why are we in emote only?
[250:02.06]Did something bad happen again?
[250:06.59]I feel like a lot of bad things have been happening in chat today.
[250:17.15]Go on, turn around, please.
[250:22.17]Are we being naughty?
[250:22.97]Is there people being naughty in the chatroom?
[250:31.18]Straight up into tall trees.
[250:37.62]Let's pick up the thing that I need to pick up, right?
[250:44.06]This is where all the bears... This is where all the animals are.
[250:48.90]This is not going to bode well.
[250:50.79]I'm a deep shit.
[250:55.99]Well, here we are.
[251:02.63]What did I need to do here?
[251:06.09]Pick up a specific item?
[251:13.98]Like this?
[251:20.72]Hummingbird sage.
[251:22.53]This is the one.
[251:24.61]How many do I need?
[251:30.83]Wait.
[251:31.73]Let me go to my journal.
[251:37.64]Undead nightmare.
[251:43.00]Um...
[251:50.15]Uh... Doing a fetch quest, I guess?
[251:58.54]I don't know.
[251:59.64]Holy fuck.
[252:07.36]What?
[252:11.30]That was such a small fall and it just fucked us both up so bad.
[252:17.32]And now I'm stuck down here.
[252:18.70]No.
[252:22.32]What is this fucking mission?
[252:23.79]What is this part of the game?
[252:32.77]What the fuck do I... Should I just go liberate these two other towns?
[252:37.62]I feel like this is... I don't know what the hell I'm supposed to be doing.
[252:48.77]Well, if you'd stop moving around so much, I'd be able to help you.
[252:52.84]I'm not going to be able to help her.
[252:55.66]Maybe I am.
[252:59.48]Any more?
[253:03.54]I... I can't save you.
[253:10.39]I can't save you.
[253:17.81]Uh...
[253:27.39]Alright, like, give me the spoilers.
[253:28.79]What the fuck am I supposed to do right now?
[253:30.19]Am I supposed to just look around to find these flowers up here?
[253:34.48]I don't understand.
[253:39.94]Someone just give it to me.
[253:42.16]Someone tell me exactly what I need to do right now.
[253:48.68]Because I've kind of run out of shit to do besides this.
[253:50.68]I'm gonna kill more Sasquatches.
[254:05.80]This is this one.
[254:08.46]Not the right one.
[254:09.10]He keeps saying, there's one.
[254:15.07]Where's Fort Mercer?
[254:24.97]I mean, I guess... Uh...
[254:35.67]Hunt the legendary creatures.
[254:44.35]Where did this horse come from?
[254:47.34]This isn't my horse.
[254:48.40]My other horse died and they gave me a new one.
[254:59.80]Gap, Tooth Ridge.
[255:00.66]I was up there already.
[255:03.30]I mean, I dare to say this.
[255:07.80]Starting to get kind of bored with this.
[255:16.90]Do I actually have to do this or do I have to just go try to do the spitter thing?
[255:28.22]Local streamer struggles to collect flowers.
[255:36.60]If I died right there, I would have been so angry.
[255:39.84]Wait, what is that?
[255:40.38]No, it's the same ones.
[255:46.46]Ow.
[255:47.35]Come back here.
[256:07.32]I can't, like, fast travel either.
[256:08.86]Uh, take it off of sub only mode.
[256:17.38]Remove sub only mode, please.
[256:22.40]Do I know which ones I need?
[256:23.42]I mean, it doesn't... I can't see what would... I know there's one that's over on the left.
[256:30.00]But I can't see anywhere else.
[256:31.39]Like, which one is it?
[256:35.06]Like, it's not, like, under briefings or challenges.
[256:37.85]Like, where do I find where the fuck it is?
[256:44.03]Right here?
[256:46.25]Okay.
[256:48.95]Violet Snowdrop and four Desert Sage.
[257:00.24]I'm gonna, like, do this one.
[257:03.45]No, like Undead Nightmare, like it's... This shit's all done.
[257:10.55]Was I supposed to get something else after that?
[257:11.89]I have no idea.
[257:17.17]I really wish this one would have actually been completed.
[257:24.50]Desert Sage and Violet Snowdrop.
[257:34.18]That's a lot of people.
[257:41.08]Well, let me just see if I can... I'm just going to go to a town.
[257:43.10]I mean, I'm going to go here.
[257:44.20]This is like... Alright, well...
[258:01.64]This DLC is like severely losing me right now.
[258:06.94]That would have been fucking hilarious if I just got hit right in the face.
[258:10.51]Uh...
[258:29.46]I think... It's completely lost me at this point.
[258:36.16]I think I'm just going to go in the multiplayer.
[258:39.38]If you guys have the game on Xbox... If this is Desert Sage, maybe I'll keep doing it.
[258:50.07]It's all the way up there.
[258:55.63]No, it's not the right one.
[259:05.05]Why would they have a fetch quest that they don't tell you, like, where it is?
[259:10.03]Well, they do, but, like, this seems like it totally fucking derails the entire fucking experience.
[259:19.53]What the fuck were they thinking?
[259:26.53]Go to Mexico?
[259:27.29]I mean, there's nothing, like, down here.
[259:33.24]Like, I have to just go down here and pick flowers and shit?
[259:38.38]That's real side mission bullshit to me.
[259:41.02]That's not like, keep playing the game to me.
[259:46.63]Whatever.
[259:49.85]Just like real life.
[259:57.53]No, you don't need to pick flowers in Mexico.
[260:10.73]Well, here's what I'm gonna do.
[260:18.12]Um... There's a Freaks and Geeks in the main story that makes you collect twice as many flowers.
[260:29.74]Let's do this.
[260:30.22]I'm gonna go up here.
[260:31.06]I'm gonna do a last-ditch effort to try... Um...
[260:42.30]I was up in Gaptooth already.
[260:43.84]So it's Gaptooth for the Sage.
[260:46.23]And where's the other one?
[260:50.39]Desert Sage.
[260:50.93]I do have to go to Mexico then.
[260:56.21]Maybe I have to have one of those survivalist maps.
[260:58.41]You can't buy anything though.
[261:06.58]Tall Trees and Gaptooth Ridge.
[261:08.82]Wasn't I just up there?
[261:14.42]Alright, we're just going into multiplayer.
[261:15.84]They lost me.
[261:18.00]I don't want to do that.
[261:18.64]I don't want to run around collecting flowers.
[261:21.90]That's not cool for me.
[261:23.02]I'm done.
[261:24.44]I'm going into multiplayer.
[261:29.96]We're just going into Xbox Live.
[261:38.53]Northern Tall Trees.
[261:47.65]Let me just save the game.
[261:55.32]Fuck, man.
[261:55.76]That really just killed it for me so hard.
[262:02.00]Damn.
[262:07.38]Xbox Live.
[262:08.18]I'm just going into public.
[262:15.66]Let's do it.
[262:19.50]Why is finding flowers such a turn off?
[262:21.10]Because it's like a World of Warcraft fetch quest where it doesn't tell me where they are.
[262:25.47]At least in World of Warcraft it tells you exactly where the flowers are.
[262:28.49]Like on the map.
[262:29.99]On the mini map.
[262:31.49]I don't want to ride around and fucking pick flowers.
[262:33.83]It's boring.
[262:47.80]Maybe we'll go back after this.
[262:49.08]I need a break from that.
[262:50.24]That was just annoying me.
[263:06.73]They tell you on the minimap?
[263:07.69]Yeah, but you have to be right next to them.
[263:13.51]Alright, here we go.
[263:15.15]We're in Red Dead Redemption multiplayer.
[263:19.05]Do I have any weapons?
[263:20.37]I have some tomahawks.
[263:22.25]Do I have a horse?
[263:31.95]I get a donkey?
[263:33.44]That's all I get.
[263:34.72]I get a fucking donkey.
[263:35.86]Well, that's great.
[263:38.10]Where's he going?
[263:38.70]Get over here.
[263:39.88]Why do I have a donkey?
[263:40.96]Where's my horse?
[263:41.70]I look like such a dickhead.
[263:50.96]Okay, what do I do?
[263:52.10]How do I like make friends?
[263:53.04]Oh look, it's a fucking flower over there.
[263:56.44]Make sure you pick it up.
[263:58.08]To progress the main storyline.
[264:04.04]What are all these things?
[264:04.77]Let's see.
[264:06.63]Gang hideout.
[264:09.13]Ferris wheel.
[264:14.73]Okay.
[264:18.67]Oh, hey.
[264:19.49]Can I get on?
[264:20.23]Oh, yeah.
[264:20.89]Let me go on yours.
[264:22.07]Because mine sucks.
[264:26.12]Oh, I... I'm sorry.
[264:27.92]I'm sorry.
[264:28.26]I'm sorry.
[264:28.50]I was trying to get on the back.
[264:30.24]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[264:31.14]It was just a jump.
[264:46.09]Okay.
[264:46.71]Oh, that's...
[264:48.46]That's Red Dead Redemption, apparently.
[264:53.19]No, no, shit.
[264:54.27]He's got like a sniper rifle.
[264:55.49]This is not fair.
[264:56.37]He's so fast.
[265:19.57]What the fuck?
[265:20.15]Was this guy body armor?
[265:26.22]Give me that stagecoach.
[265:33.36]I don't want my fucking dumb donkey.
[265:44.51]I'm such a useless person right now.
[265:48.44]Bring him down to Mexico?
[265:51.76]Okay, well, let's just go down here.
[265:53.20]Alright, you know what?
[265:57.34]Let's go here.
[265:57.86]Let's go to the gang hideout.
[265:58.86]We're close enough to be there.
[266:01.96]It is a pretty cute donkey, that's true.
[266:09.58]That's so insulting, though.
[266:11.16]You start on the multiplayer and you just get this terrible fucking mule.
[266:20.20]This donkey ain't going up that cliff, no way.
[266:31.92]Hey, I hope this is entertaining!
[266:34.56]Guy riding on a fucking donkey!
[266:39.65]Are we still in Undead Nightmare?
[266:40.71]Can I shoot this donkey in the head?
[266:42.69]Got him.
[266:42.99]Oh, that wasn't a player.
[266:46.36]Well, still got him.
[266:47.86]And I want his horse.
[266:48.60]Come here.
[266:49.70]There's a zombie survival mode.
[267:01.37]Is something following me?
[267:05.73]I thought I saw movement.
[267:11.65]Play the undead game mode.
[267:12.65]Alright, I'm gonna try to do one thing in multiplayer.
[267:16.54]And then... The mule can't even jump.
[267:19.84]Yeah, I guess it can.
[267:20.44]This is what inspired GTA Online.
[267:33.38]You wanna watch me fail to pick more flowers.
[267:35.96]I don't think you do.
[267:38.88]I don't think you do.
[267:39.68]I think that's gonna be excruciating to watch.
[267:42.77]I don't know what that is over there on the left.
[267:51.87]There's a guy in here, though.
[267:55.47]Kill the gang.
[267:57.07]We need to work together, then.
[267:58.51]There's somebody already in here.
[268:02.05]There's a guy in here.
[268:06.17]So, do I have anything I can use?
[268:13.21]Plus 10?
[268:13.43]Oh, you just get money for killing people.
[268:17.63]Right in the head.
[268:21.39]Come on.
[268:25.83]Somebody else is here, too.
[268:26.61]Alright, hopefully... Is that guy going to shoot me in the back?
[268:29.82]I would assume he would be.
[268:32.46]You know, there's, like, another player.
[268:37.88]Don't do it.
[268:38.56]Come on.
[268:38.76]We need to, like, work together and liberate this hideout.
[268:44.05]You go in first.
[268:44.61]You can bait.
[268:47.08]I turned into the bait.
[268:48.54]Another guy up there.
[269:01.42]One guy's head.
[269:02.10]Come on.
[269:07.44]He's not going to show his head, is he?
[269:08.73]No, he's not.
[269:13.85]That's the dude whose horse you stole?
[269:16.07]What?
[269:25.17]Does anybody have any guns or anything?
[269:32.73]Did I just get killed by the boss?
[269:47.67]It actually might be time for me to end the stream.
[269:50.45]I'm like hungry.
[269:51.15]I'm getting like tired.
[269:52.07]I haven't eaten at all today.
[269:55.14]I didn't have electricity for fucking 12 hours today.
[269:57.68]It's been like a kind of an annoying day.
[270:01.00]Thanks a lot.
[270:18.17]Jerma, I too had an outage.
[270:30.34]He's in here.
[270:30.86]The bad guy's in here.
[270:33.44]There he is.
[270:40.88]There he is.
[270:41.22]I got him.
[270:42.72]I got a Schofield.
[270:49.36]Picking flowers, end of the stream.
[271:00.73]No flowers, no hope.
[271:09.75]I can see how this could be fun though.
[271:14.73]One more guy, where is he?
[271:15.57]At least complete this and see what happens.
[271:19.25]Oh, I got a repeater.
[271:19.87]I don't really dare.
[271:22.61]This guy's probably in a party and they're gonna laugh and they're gonna throw a fucking grenade at me.
[271:31.52]That looked like it could have been painful.
[271:47.42]Dead?
[271:47.66]+2 bucks.
[271:49.56]Come on, laugh at me.
[271:55.52]Well, there he is.
[272:22.68]What happened?
[272:25.50]Hey!
[272:26.16]I did it!
[272:26.62]Oh, there's a flower!
[272:28.02]There's a flower!
[272:28.94]Alright, let's see if I can, uh... I'm just gonna throw a knife at one of these guys and then end the stream.
[272:53.39]I wasn't trying to hack him.
[272:59.33]Alright, see you later.
[273:02.54]Tomorrow, next stream, I'm going to eat a fucking ghost pepper!
[273:06.36]No.
[273:08.54]Yeah, I mean, I probably would have gone another maybe half hour, hour.
[273:12.58]But I'm getting tired that that fetch quest just go pick up flowers mission killed the whole game for me.
[273:20.94]It just did.
[273:22.19]I can't lie to you guys.
[273:27.07]I spent the whole game doing interesting things.
[273:29.39]And then it wants me to do like a World of Warcraft mission.
[273:32.36]I'm not into that.
[273:39.28]Anyways, that is going to conclude Red Dead Redemption.
[273:46.62]I will see you guys on Thursday.
[273:49.03]We're going to do something interesting on Thursday.
[273:51.29]I'm going to be playing either The End of Znai or Timeshift.
[273:58.37]Timeshift is an old game and it's fucking stupid, but it's a ton of fun.
[274:05.76]You will see if you don't know what Timeshift is.
[274:09.98]But, yeah.
[274:13.36]Thanks for watching.
[274:14.22]Sorry I'm kind of getting out of here, like, abruptly.
[274:16.54]I'm just having eaten all day, and I had some annoying things to deal with earlier.
[274:20.34]I'm just kind of, like, in one of those moods where I'm just like, eh.
[274:24.95]Not necessarily want to keep going.
[274:27.85]But, uh, we went for four and a half, five hours just about tonight.
[274:32.29]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[274:34.93]For probably time shift.
[274:38.88]Much love, guys.
[274:39.44]Take care.
[274:40.30]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[274:43.88]And let's see, did I miss any, like, bits or anything?
[274:47.24]Thanks to all the new subs.
[274:48.42]There's been actually, there's been a lot of new subscribers recently.
[274:52.86]And I just, like, thanks.
[274:54.66]Thank you so much.
[274:55.62]Like, a shitload of new subs have come in over the last, like, two weeks.
[275:00.84]More than I could possibly count or imagine, so.
[275:05.19]Thank you.
[275:06.37]Love you guys.
[275:07.75]See ya.
[275:08.33]I love you.
[275:08.99]See you on Thursday.
[275:10.79]Bye-bye.
[275:25.71]you
[276:00.60]you
