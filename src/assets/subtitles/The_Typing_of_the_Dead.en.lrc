[00:02.42]So let's open that.
[00:03.44]Oh, should I get to move everything to the other screen now?
[00:06.80]Whoops.
[00:07.75]Okay, hold on.
[00:12.09]German's true resume.
[00:12.97]What is he doing?
[00:15.69]I forgot this is a Sega game.
[00:16.77]By the way, we're doing this on easy.
[00:23.97]This is very loud.
[00:24.77]I'm glad I turned it off.
[00:28.47]Audio settings.
[00:32.50]Okay, sound effects, dialogue.
[00:37.09]There we go.
[00:40.69]Subtitles can stay on.
[00:42.73]Give me one sec.
[00:45.66]I need to get my video settings correct.
[00:48.48]1280x720, nope.
[00:51.38]That's not fucking happening.
[00:52.38]Okay, uh, controls, DLC, dictionaries.
[00:57.57]That guy's naked.
[00:58.33]Alright, hold on.
[01:01.01]Move this.
[01:04.07]Turn this back on.
[01:05.95]Move it down.
[01:07.97]I don't need my mouse for this, I don't think, right?
[01:09.57]I don't think so.
[01:12.53]Down here.
[01:16.34]Here's your face cam of my hand.
[01:20.08]You're going to get to see all kinds of funny shit when this happens, right?
[01:23.68]Mm-hmm.
[01:35.19]Like, this is not gonna work.
[01:38.05]There we go.
[01:38.55]Is that big enough?
[01:40.03]Is that okay?
[01:41.25]That's okay, right?
[01:42.27]Can I flip this?
[01:43.33]How do I flip it?
[01:45.11]Flip it, right?
[01:45.64]I'm gonna flip it.
[01:48.74]Flip it.
[01:49.78]Transform it.
[01:50.40]Flip it.
[01:52.62]There we go!
[01:53.34]Look at that!
[01:53.90]Perfect, right?
[02:01.64]Is that better?
[02:02.12]Or does that look too weird?
[02:08.47]Does that look way too weird?
[02:09.67]Are we in a weird skewed thing here?
[02:13.93]Go back.
[02:14.39]You don't like it like this?
[02:16.77]Flip it and reverse it?
[02:18.54]Does that look right?
[02:19.56]It looks right, doesn't it?
[02:22.92]Now we're going to flip it again.
[02:25.50]Transform.
[02:26.14]Flip it.
[02:30.51]There we go.
[02:31.19]Perfect.
[02:33.75]Typing of the dead.
[02:38.68]Everyone's like, holy shit, it looks fucking awful.
[02:45.75]There's not a whole real good way to do this, is there?
[02:48.51]That's like the best I can do.
[02:51.78]Adjust the focus.
[02:52.98]I can't.
[02:53.36]It's going to keep being a piece of shit.
[02:57.74]Hold on.
[02:58.04]Maybe I can configure.
[03:01.04]We're going to turn off auto focus.
[03:02.60]Auto focus is off.
[03:05.83]That should be better.
[03:07.53]Make sure, let's just get this set up for real.
[03:09.88]Okay, autofocus.
[03:13.94]Whoa, that's not what we wanted.
[03:15.36]Here we go.
[03:17.20]We're good.
[03:17.90]Perfect.
[03:20.16]Now let's get typing in the dead up.
[03:25.36]And add.
[03:27.40]I love how this turned into a different stream.
[03:30.04]I'm happy with it.
[03:33.16]Typing in the dead.
[03:33.94]There it is.
[03:34.52]Okay.
[03:36.70]Pull this down.
[03:38.10]Game chapter should be above, beyond.
[03:40.56]There it is.
[03:42.26]Alright, I gotta get this down.
[03:46.74]Sorry, this is taking a little longer than expected.
[03:50.36]Just needed to set this all up.
[03:53.98]Change the stream title.
[03:54.82]I did.
[03:55.04]It's how I use the keyboard.
[03:57.46]That hasn't changed.
[03:59.62]This is how I use the keyboard.
[04:03.64]And we're playing on the children difficulty, guys.
[04:09.22]Somebody just gave 50 fucking dollars.
[04:12.46]Kane the Insane.
[04:15.59]Thank you for the fucking 50 bucks.
[04:21.43]Holy shit.
[04:22.23]All right.
[04:22.45]Can you see it?
[04:24.77]Can we see it on the screen or no?
[04:28.28]We cannot see it.
[04:29.30]Why is it so little?
[04:31.64]What the fuck is it so little for?
[04:33.42]Video settings.
[04:34.06]1920 by 1080.
[04:35.84]Let's go, man.
[04:38.94]That's not 1080.
[04:40.34]That's very much not 1080.
[04:41.20]Okay, well, now... Now it is.
[04:49.16]I don't know why that did that, but whatever.
[04:55.45]Okay.
[04:58.49]Small window, I guess.
[04:59.77]But anyways, can't even say anything about the $50.
[05:02.01]Germany, you're my favorite human.
[05:04.19]You deserve everything on my credit card.
[05:05.85]Don't forget to dab on them haters on stream for all your germamy mites.
[05:10.97]Well, Kane, thank you for the 50 fucking bucks.
[05:15.13]I hope you've been entertained.
[05:17.99]That's all I care about.
[05:20.54]Thank you so much, dude.
[05:21.24]And Spritech, thanks again for the 50.
[05:24.00]No, he didn't.
[05:25.26]He gave a dollar, but it still doesn't matter how much you give.
[05:30.68]As long as, like, as long as you're here, I don't care.
[05:33.38]All right.
[05:33.66]Minigames, story mode, game setting.

[05:47.73]Do I have to click on bitch?
[05:50.91]Well, try agent.
[05:52.91]What kind of settings are these?
[05:56.04]Bitch, agent, or motherfucker.

[16:47.22]I don't think we're coming back from this one.
[16:52.65]I got to open up Steam and find out what button is print screen because then we can narrow it down and we can figure it out.
[17:03.39]Hold on.
[17:04.89]Give me one second.

[18:05.37]Wipe the keyboard off.
[18:12.69]I don't have anything in here.
[18:14.09]This keyboard was a piece of junk anyways, don't worry.
[18:23.17]I need a new mouse pad.
[18:24.17]That was what was gonna happen.
[18:30.65]It's not happening anymore though.
[18:34.41]I think we're good.
[18:36.01]Blow on it.
[18:37.86]Use my shirt.
[18:43.94]I still have no idea how to get this off the screen.
[18:46.92]And somehow we're still, well, okay.
