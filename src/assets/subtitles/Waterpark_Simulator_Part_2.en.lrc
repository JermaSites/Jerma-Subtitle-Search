[00:37.21]Hey, what's up?
[00:38.03]How you doing?
[00:41.93]You chilling?
[00:43.58]Welcome back to another edition of Streaming.
[00:52.95]We've got a stream for you today.
[00:54.93]This one is a continuation of Waterpark Simulator from a few days ago.
[01:10.86]We had just, we had, we had just got the second tier of park.
[01:25.01]I just opened it.
[01:33.60]The intro, yeah, the intro's back.
[01:36.02]I told you that when I streamed again, there would be the intro, it would be back.
[01:41.65]And we're unlocking them as we go.
[01:44.99]See, the stream after this one, whenever it is, will have a BRB screen.
[01:50.80]And then the one after that will have the outro too.
[02:02.06]No, they're all here.
[02:04.60]I have to link the browser source back.
[02:10.09]Hey, please play Silksong.
[02:11.55]I'm crying and screaming.
[02:14.69]It came out today.
[02:15.50]That's why we're seeing this, right?
[02:18.48]I've seen a lot of people tell me to do that.
[02:25.43]Guys, I played Hollow Knight seven and a half years ago and got 40% of the way through the campaign.
[02:33.09]I don't think I'm ready for the sequel.
[02:46.33]You need to finish it.
[02:47.87]Yeah, maybe one day.
[02:53.28]Play the restaurant game again.
[03:01.45]After I have the world's greatest water park.
[03:06.60]Can you fix the music?
[03:07.46]What's wrong with the music?
[03:10.11]Refresh your page.
[03:16.19]But I mean, is it good?
[03:17.06]Is Silksong good?
[03:17.92]People like it?
[03:18.42]I mean, it's only been out for like a day, right?
[03:21.16]How is it?
[03:26.95]It's fine.
[03:29.20]Don't he said it's fine?
[03:31.28]It's fine.
[03:33.24]Oh no.
[03:37.61]That's what you say to the waiter when you hate your food, but you don't want to make a problem.
[03:42.98]And how are those, uh, how are those mashed potatoes?
[03:46.19]Fine.
[03:47.61]Oh, okay.
[03:48.27]Great.
[03:48.61]Let me know if you need anything.
[03:50.42]Yep.
[04:07.89]Thought he was doing a bit and they but no line did a bit and somebody said you already did it.
[04:13.21]Don't make me The Simpsons, please.
[04:15.28]Don't do a Simpsons did it to everybody.
[04:16.99]I beg of you.
[04:28.72]Somebody makes a funny joke and it's... Please don't be like... Well, you know, Jarvis said this.
[04:34.59]Don't do that to me.
[04:35.61]Please.
[04:36.31]Please, I beg of you.
[04:37.16]Please don't do that.
[04:42.63]Can we at least get a Homer impression?
[04:57.89]Yeah, sure.
[04:59.31]There you go.
[05:06.70]Now do Bart.
[05:08.15]Come on, man.
[05:10.37]Who else?
[05:13.15]Don't fucking do this to me.
[05:14.37]Don't do this to me.
[05:15.24]I'm telling you, don't do this to me.
[05:18.68]Marge?
[05:21.26]Don't do this to me.
[05:22.95]I am telling you, you better not do this to me.
[05:30.61]Now Mr. Satan.
[05:31.83]Of course I'll do Mr. Satan.
[05:33.76]One of the biggest, one of the best characters in there in The Simpsons.
[05:39.32]If anybody does a Mr. Satan impression ever again, don't fucking do this to me.
[05:52.68]Did you do Mr. Burns?
[05:55.55]The dude has four voices.
[06:13.12]I don't give a fuck, okay?
[06:14.54]I don't care.
[06:18.14]This is the starting soon screen.
[06:19.61]We're going to play the water park game.
[06:21.31]Will you sit down?
[06:22.77]Sit down.
[06:25.32]You were like up in your seat pointing at me.
[06:27.16]Sit down!
[06:30.61]Did you cut your hair?
[06:31.21]Not yet.
[06:42.85]Are you ready?
[06:46.86]Dude, did you see that transition?
[06:48.12]Oh, it's like smooth.
[06:51.75]Look at how buttery this all is.
[06:53.25]I know I'm saying the same shit that I said a few days ago, but whatever.
[06:57.75]Okay.
[06:58.72]You can't hear it.
[07:00.26]Now you can.
[07:03.92]I want to try it.
[07:04.72]Somebody said the music that I had on here, I kind of screwed it all up.
[07:08.39]And there really should be more than one track.
[07:12.13]So we're going to try it again.
[07:20.92]There should be multiple tracks.
[07:23.51]That's what I'm saying.
[07:30.06]We'll try it.
[07:32.76]Okay.
[07:33.40]Continue.
[07:36.44]Okay, I just freaked out for a second.
[07:37.69]I forgot I named it this.
[07:39.93]It's like, who has access to my computer?
[07:43.09]And why did they write that?
[07:53.38]Alright, what was I doing?
[07:56.36]There are other tracks.
[07:59.63]Ooh, look at those graphics.
[08:11.99]One of Yoshi's skins in Mario Kart World looks like Brian Griffin.
[08:16.84]I wanted to make sure I brought that up today.
[08:22.32]I swear to God.
[08:23.86]I forget which one.
[08:27.22]It looks exactly like... It looks like Brian Griffin.
[08:32.71]Alright.
[08:32.89]Alright, we're good.
[08:35.62]Which one is it?
[08:36.52]Nobody asked which one.
[08:37.48]I'm just making sure that you know that one of them, you'll know.
[08:41.02]If you play Mario Kart World, you'll know.
[08:45.49]You'll unlock it and go, holy shit, that's what Skinny was talking about.
[08:52.79]This is like hanging out with an eight-year-old.
[08:57.75]I make one statement about... What are you talking about?
[09:04.62]I remembered something from a day or two ago that I wanted to bring up, so I brought it up.
[09:26.74]Where's my dashboard?
[09:27.73]I can't see any.
[09:28.57]Hold on.
[09:36.94]I can't see what everyone's saying.
[09:39.00]I can see your chats, but I can't see the important behind the scenes information.
[09:45.85]There it is OK.
[09:53.63]Nobody's called me a 5K Andy.
[09:56.41]Stop!
[09:58.17]Stop!
[10:11.22]We want Casino Inc.
[10:12.70]We want Casino Inc.
[10:15.23]You're gonna have to wait a little bit longer for that.
[10:26.63]5k is good.
[10:27.40]5k is crazy.
[10:34.39]I don't care.
[10:34.95]I don't care about how many people are here.
[10:39.12]I don't care.
[10:40.57]How many are there though?
[10:52.13]Guys, I only stream at this point for my mother, okay?
[10:56.54]We talk about the jokes.
[10:59.22]She brings up her favorite parts of the stream.
[11:00.64]I'm only streaming for my mother at this point.
[11:08.19]She just sent me a text.
[11:09.13]LOL, I see it.
[11:11.43]And it's a screenshot of her TV and she's playing Mario Kart World.
[11:16.02]And I think that's... Yeah, that's the Yoshi.
[11:19.46]I think.
[11:22.27]She gets it.
[11:30.34]Is the game too loud right now?
[11:31.67]Turned it up.
[11:38.76]Too loud?
[11:45.57]Good?
[11:46.15]Okay.
[11:50.20]Dude, look at all this.
[11:50.98]I completely forgot I had this.
[11:53.72]I was just walking around here going, oh yeah, let's clean that up.
[11:56.83]Make that look nice.
[11:57.63]I forgot this existed.
[11:58.71]Look at all this.
[12:03.26]Alright, hold on.
[12:03.72]I'm not done cleaning.
[12:12.91]Should I buy another slide?
[12:15.73]There's so much space for activities now.
[12:17.09]There really is.
[12:28.18]Would you go to this water park?
[12:30.47]Maybe.
[12:32.63]If the hot dogs were good.
[12:35.50]What if it's one of those scenarios where the water park sucks, but the food is awesome?
[12:39.58]So it's like, don't go for the water park.
[12:40.75]You go for the best hot dog in America.
[12:45.19]Okay.
[12:45.33]What do I want to build now?
[12:47.72]Are these good?
[12:58.37]There is another track.
[12:59.57]I like this song.
[13:00.18]This song's good.
[13:05.52]Okay.
[13:05.64]Everything is perfect.
[13:07.12]I need to push cheaters from your park.
[13:09.55]I can do that.
[13:09.97]I can do that very well.
[13:11.79]What goes on a hot dog?
[13:12.89]Okay.
[13:14.79]Listen.
[13:16.21]What goes on a hot dog is very simple.
[13:18.18]Depends on the kind of mood you're in.
[13:22.32]For me, it's either one straight line of mustard.
[13:27.90]Just regular yellow mustard.
[13:29.95]One just... Straight line across.
[13:32.51]Not in the bun, on top of the dog.
[13:36.41]Right across.
[13:36.87]If it's kind of a fun day... Well, actually, you can do this with more than one.
[13:43.88]Usually I eat two or three hot dogs in one sitting.
[13:46.80]Hot dog number two is going to be... I can't...
[13:54.64]I can't.
[13:55.36]I'm sorry, guys.
[13:56.30]I can't.
[13:58.52]Okay, hot dog number two is ketchup, Tabasco, and maybe like a third of a slice of mild cheddar.
[14:12.98]That mild cheddar goes in the bun.
[14:14.81]Hot dog goes on top.
[14:16.69]Ketchup, Tabasco.
[14:22.85]Old cheddar.
[14:23.63]Will you heat it up with the hot dog?
[14:29.30]What the fuck?
[14:30.54]You guys ask me for my hot dogs and then you say what the f- Everyone has a different hot dog opinion, okay?
[14:35.55]The hot dog that you eat is not going to be the same as the hot dog next to you.
[14:40.54]That hot dog next to you is going to order something different.
[14:48.48]And then the classic peppers and onions.
[14:51.19]Peppers and onions just goes good on anything.
[14:55.09]Especially a hot dog.
[14:56.97]So yeah, depends.
[15:02.64]Now what am I buying?
[15:06.36]Chili dogs?
[15:07.64]Um, I do like chili dogs, but I would say ketchup, Tabasco, sliced cheddar, or one thing of mustard, or peppers and onions.
[15:25.90]I feel like I don't want another pool.
[15:27.30]It's way more to clean.
[15:28.50]Maybe another slide?
[15:31.04]What if I just make like five rusty slides?
[15:41.92]I'll do this for now.
[15:42.40]How much is this?
[15:43.58]Is it expensive?
[15:48.55]Maybe just a hangout pool.
[15:50.14]Okay, I'm going to make one hangout pool over here.
[15:59.95]Okay.
[16:01.31]I'm not spending any more money.
[16:04.35]Need to hire people?
[16:05.18]I can do it all myself!
[16:15.23]The game is wicked loud!
[16:16.45]I don't know what you guys are talking about.
[16:17.81]Am I crazy, or is the game insanely loud?
[16:25.66]It definitely is.
[16:27.81]Here.
[16:35.64]Pull.
[16:42.49]That's pretty cool.
[16:43.45]Alright.
[16:44.17]Nice.
[16:44.97]Nice.
[16:47.65]Alright.
[16:48.05]I'm gonna open.
[16:48.69]I got flyers.
[16:51.37]I have one person helping me.
[16:53.17]Okay.
[16:53.45]How much does it cost for... I need somebody at the concession stand.
[17:01.94]200 bucks a day?
[17:02.82]289?
[17:07.43]This person's got pretty good skills, right?
[17:09.61]Oh, wait.
[17:09.90]This one's a 220.
[17:10.86]Okay.
[17:11.64]This person's cheaper.
[17:12.62]They're way less efficient, though.
[17:17.12]I think that's fine.
[17:22.17]Now I got somebody working.
[17:23.11]Did they go buy inventory?
[17:32.86]Do they actually restock or do I have to do it?
[17:39.63]I didn't hire that person?
[17:40.55]Yeah, I didn't.
[17:43.86]Wait, what?
[17:46.82]Oh, I have to... I can't even hire another person.
[17:51.23]Well, I'm glad you said that because I would have just... I would have... Okay, let's go over to the park.
[17:58.54]What bathroom could I smoke Criken?
[18:00.87]None of them.
[18:01.37]If I see you doing that, you're out of here.
[18:11.05]No.
[18:12.67]No.
[18:15.38]No, come on.
[18:15.90]I want to get rid of these last two.
[18:16.86]Come on.
[18:20.16]Oh my God, I forgot you can hurt people.
[18:24.32]Sorry.
[18:26.31]Sorry, come here.
[18:31.65]Alright.
[18:34.05]Have a good day at the park everybody.
[18:36.92]and make sure, oh man, I, if I were you, I wouldn't go in the new slide called the Annihilator.
[18:44.39]I heard it was so scary.
[18:46.50]I heard it was not scary at all, you know?
[18:50.28]What the fuck?
[19:01.56]Cheater!
[19:08.68]I'm just... I'm waiting for the cheaters.
[19:10.10]That's all I'm doing.
[19:12.10]When are you gonna play Rainbow Six?
[19:16.01]What?
[19:16.21]Is this a game request hour?
[19:17.57]No, I gotta open my stream with I do not take feedback.
[19:30.35]I do not take...
[19:43.31]I do not take feedback.
[19:44.37]I do not take requests.
[19:45.43]There will never be a patch and then and then in huge red letters.
[19:51.91]Gov it up your ass.
[19:56.43]I like that.
[20:00.66]No, I was right here.
[20:15.08]Put that on screen right now.
[20:18.87]No, I don't have a reason to.
[20:20.11]I'm good.
[20:29.00]Look at how much people are having so much fun on the Annihilator.
[20:36.85]You guys see any wristbands?
[20:44.85]This person keeps drowning.
[20:47.94]Isn't the life jacket or whatever right next to them?
[21:02.34]Okay.
[21:03.01]Thanks for the $5 tip.
[21:04.15]I appreciate it.
[21:15.21]Ooh, a lot of people want lemonade.
[21:16.99]What do you want?
[21:17.41]Okay, lemonade and lemon.
[21:21.17]What do you want?
[21:24.60]Just a lemonade.
[21:26.20]There you go.
[21:27.90]That person stinks.
[21:28.58]I'll take care of it in a second.
[21:33.91]A lot of spills, right?
[21:41.07]Over here.
[21:52.45]You're fine.
[21:57.10]Oh my god, multiple things smell.
[22:04.95]I need workers!
[22:06.41]I actually do need workers so bad.
[22:08.05]I can only have one of one.
[22:10.46]Here.
[22:23.37]I think I'm scaring people.
[22:24.61]Yeah.
[22:28.73]You think?
[22:32.42]Alright, I gotta take care of this.
[22:33.46]This is ridiculous.
[22:37.38]Why is it like a smelly person day today?
[22:51.34]What was that lemonade?
[22:55.26]There you go.
[22:57.34]Was that a hot dog?
[22:58.02]Plain hot dog.
[22:58.91]See, I don't understand a plain hot dog person.
[23:02.75]You guys thought that my second hot dog choice was weird.
[23:04.89]I don't know.
[23:05.31]A plain hot dog just doesn't work for me.
[23:14.57]Hold on.
[23:17.71]Plain hot dog is S tier.
[23:21.40]I don't.
[23:22.18]I disagree.
[23:26.43]Well, hold on a second.
[23:27.37]A plain hot dog is not the worst thing in the world, I think.
[23:31.72]If, oh shit, I need lemons.
[23:36.92]If it comes off of the grill, that has to be specifically on a, that fire has to be touching that.
[23:46.86]You know what I'm saying?
[23:55.98]That's gotta be flame broiled.
[23:58.18]And then I agree with you.
[23:59.54]But if it's not flame broiled, then... Hold on a second.
[24:12.13]This makes... This is such a money maker.
[24:14.00]I have to be here for it.
[24:24.28]Yeah, like steamed hot dog plain.
[24:27.50]I don't know, it's kind of watery, isn't it?
[24:37.03]Wait, you cheated!
[24:37.73]Oh fuck, everybody's falling down.
[24:48.33]I have to do something about this.
[24:50.29]Who smells?
[24:51.75]Excuse me.
[24:52.87]Ah, whoever here smells.
[24:54.97]Getting a lot of complaints.
[24:59.26]Ladies and gentlemen.
[25:00.14]Ah, no!
[25:00.82]No, he went in the pool.
[25:05.37]Ah, the manager fell in the pool with his clothes on.
[25:08.99]Fuck that guy.
[25:09.87]No, no, no.
[25:11.12]I need order here.
[25:12.06]I need order here.
[25:22.70]Imagine coming over here.
[25:23.80]Excuse me?
[25:24.42]Yeah, I'm the owner of the park.
[25:27.12]Just wanted to ask a quick question.
[25:28.38]Who smells over here?
[25:29.57]We're getting a lot of complaints.
[25:33.15]About the person that stinks and I don't know who it is.
[25:36.93]Oh shit.
[25:40.88]+2 so funny gorillas in Fortnite.
[25:47.97]Yeah!
[25:49.51]I got it!
[25:50.07]Why did I not get money for that?
[25:53.58]What?
[25:58.40]I received a fine?
[26:05.55]Oh shit, that person's dead.
[26:06.92]Hold on.
[26:09.90]Hold on a second.
[26:10.72]Somebody smells it.
[26:11.96]Oh, it might be the corpse.
[26:15.15]Sorry about that.
[26:15.91]I thought somebody farted over there.
[26:17.37]I thought somebody shit in the pool, but it's the dead person.
[26:22.64]Carry on, I apologize.
[26:27.00]Bro, hurry up.
[26:28.08]I made that person up, but I agree.
[26:30.69]There's too many people in the pool.
[26:32.87]There's too many people at the park.
[26:34.61]I need to reduce the amount of people at the park.
[26:38.22]Too many people at the park.
[26:40.60]Ladies and gentlemen, I'm the owner.
[26:41.95]There's too many people here.
[26:44.49]I'm going to be giving away 10% refunds.
[26:48.37]And a coupon for a small Coke.
[26:51.37]Please leave, all of you.
[27:02.63]Is there anything worse than a small cup of coke?
[27:08.81]I can't even talk.
[27:10.45]Is there anything worse than a small fountain cup of coke as an enticement to do something?
[27:18.00]Oh yeah, if you come now, if you order a large fry, we'll get you a small fountain Coke.
[27:24.71]Come on, man.
[27:26.23]That shouldn't even be in the Monopoly.
[27:28.90]That shouldn't be in the McDonald's Monopoly.
[27:38.31]Sometimes that hits.
[27:40.61]It should be included, though.
[27:42.73]Small cup of Coke should be not a big deal for a coupon.
[27:47.69]Do they even do this?
[27:48.85]Am I making up a problem?
[27:49.95]No, I'm not, right?
[27:50.79]They do that.
[27:51.41]They've done it before.
[27:52.55]They've done it like before in the past.
[28:00.72]I think you're delusional.
[28:04.87]Didn't McDonald's Monopoly game have a thing where it was like, and you can get a small fountain beverage of your choice.
[28:12.94]I guess it's free.
[28:18.85]Please hire more workers.
[28:20.02]I have to unlock it first.
[28:21.40]I can only have one.
[28:22.94]At the end of this day, I will.
[28:28.06]Any cheaters that I'm missing?
[28:31.47]Looking for wristbands.
[28:34.61]What's up, bud?
[28:42.72]I have a wristband!
[28:52.62]no get them oh my god where'd they go see that gamer skill right there I could have kept swinging
[29:20.74]I've got 2,500 bucks.
[29:22.48]This is crazy, actually.
[29:25.18]It's alright.
[29:25.80]The complaints will go away.
[29:28.48]I can research more employees.
[29:30.71]Here.
[29:31.99]I'll squirt the mustard into your mouth.
[29:34.53]How about this?
[29:34.89]You come up around here.
[29:36.51]And you can lean down and smell in here.
[29:39.10]Smell in that hot dog smell.
[29:41.18]And then turn your head back.
[29:42.18]And I'll squirt the mustard in your mouth.
[29:43.28]Take a big swallow and sniff in.
[29:45.40]And it's like as if you ate one.
[29:46.85]Oh my god, what's happening?
[30:10.23]That person cheated.
[30:11.05]That person cheated too!
[30:18.74]Hey, we're closed.
[30:35.04]Now get out of here!
[31:15.16]Have a good day.
[31:16.43]Thanks for coming to Big J's Splash Zone.
[31:19.63]Remember, a free fountain coke.
[31:36.49]What a mess.
[31:36.95]I got a lot of money though.
[31:38.37]Okay.
[31:39.35]Research points.
[31:40.17]I got a lot of points.
[31:40.95]I got a lot of money.
[31:43.28]I need to be able to hire another person.
[31:48.26]Hiring level 3.
[31:50.09]Hiring level 2.
[31:53.43]Okay, I need to get this to go down this tier.
[31:55.47]Bigger pockets, that's good.
[31:56.97]That's good.
[31:57.39]Okay, handyman staff.
[32:00.98]Good.
[32:01.92]I got money, right?
[32:02.62]Yep.
[32:04.08]And then we'll do hiring level 3.
[32:06.45]Now I can actually have employees.
[32:08.51]I'm going to hire a ton of employees.
[32:14.06]Who do I want?
[32:15.44]I got somebody working the tickets.
[32:18.28]We need a repair.
[32:18.86]So this is going to be like $600 or $700 a day.
[32:23.05]That's not bad.
[32:25.41]That's way better.
[32:27.41]That's even better.
[32:29.74]Movement speed is 2.
[32:30.86]Is that bad?
[32:36.18]Only 107 endurance though.
[32:38.81]I think Kyler is the one.
[32:42.71]Tons of endurance.
[32:44.07]Good precision.
[32:46.00]Higher tomorrow.
[32:46.80]Right, right, right, right, right.
[32:52.43]Hey dude, I'm watching you from the NASA base.
[32:54.11]I think they banned me from the Wi-Fi.
[32:58.78]Stop using up all the Wi-Fi to watch some shitty streamer.
[33:13.64]Okay, well, I'm not going to do this till tomorrow.
[33:15.97]So let's repair and wash everything.
[33:17.87]I can actually have employees.
[33:20.87]It's going to be great.
[33:24.98]Clean the whole park up.
[33:25.80]I have enough room for a lot of things too.
[33:31.01]Now I can actually carry stuff.
[33:32.35]I'm going to carry a life preserver.
[33:35.91]Alright, we got repair and clean.
[33:37.03]Let's go.
[33:47.12]Stop calling my streamer shitty.
[34:01.00]Darning beef with myself.
[34:11.95]Honestly?
[34:13.09]Yeah.
[34:14.37]I kinda- I feel like that's accurate.
[34:21.84]These things are messed up.
[34:31.62]Lower the FOV to 60.
[34:34.97]No.
[34:37.39]Why would I lower the FOV to 60?
[34:39.37]That sounds awful.
[34:45.86]I think this is going to be a $3,000 profit day tomorrow.
[34:49.90]That's what I'm anticipating.
[34:58.89]Okay, if I buy... Did the hot dogs go bad?
[35:03.90]If I buy two or three of them and just put them on the ground right here, will they last?
[35:10.51]That kind of makes sense, right?
[35:17.40]Everything here... Wait, these are not clean.
[35:24.83]Volume is not loud enough.
[35:29.00]It's hard to tell sometimes.
[35:38.95]The stands are blocking the new area.
[35:40.96]Really?
[35:44.56]People can get over there.
[35:45.30]I've seen a lot of people go over there already.
[35:50.75]Bro, I just lost my Rocket League rank up.
[35:58.21]well from you gotta tell us what was the what rank because if you're talking about going from like wood to like grass then it's fine man no trash
[36:39.18]Yeah, I think that'd be so fun to have.
[36:40.78]I know like Hearthstone kind of... Didn't Hearthstone do this in a way?
[36:45.47]But imagine having like 50 ranks.
[36:49.68]It goes from, you know, from let's say like Dirt.
[36:54.25]If you were like Dirt 1... No, no, no.
[36:57.53]It would be Dirt 5, right?
[36:59.48]If you were Dirt 5 in a game...
[37:02.54]That would be so funny.
[37:04.72]Imagine fighting how toxic those lobbies in Dirt 5 through Dirt 1 would be.
[37:18.94]Yeah, I think you could really solve the online toxic video game problem.
[37:22.43]Just have like 75 ranks.
[37:25.32]From, like, Dirt 5 all the way to, like, a galaxy material or something.
[37:31.31]I don't know.
[37:31.89]Like, I know there's, like, Challenger and Gladiator.
[37:35.50]No, no, no.
[37:36.14]It would need to be, like, Plutonium.
[37:39.31]Or... What's, like, a gas that's only in a different galaxy than ours?
[37:50.73]Helium.
[37:51.37]No, no, no.
[37:51.91]Helium would be, like, mid-rank.
[37:53.86]There'd be a rank for everything on the periodic table.
[37:58.40]Uh, all foods.
[38:00.15]Right, so you'd go, you'd start at, like, organic matter, like dirt.
[38:03.43]Then grass.
[38:05.04]Then, like, you know, plastic.
[38:06.68]And you'd make your way up.
[38:07.70]There's gonna be, like, three or four hundred ranks.
[38:10.76]One on the cob six, yeah.
[38:12.15]Like, hot dog four.
[38:27.25]Yeah, and some of them would be other games, right?
[38:31.69]Like, what rank are you?
[38:33.40]Oh, yeah, dude, I'm... I'm plastic 2.
[38:36.54]What are you?
[38:36.94]Oh, I'm Overwatch 3.
[38:41.75]I feel like you'd get in trouble.
[38:46.44]Like, where's that again?
[38:47.16]Oh, it's like kind of mid to high up there.
[38:54.16]And people would be like, oh, dude, I'm gold.
[38:55.95]I'm gold, too.
[38:56.93]That's sick.
[38:57.79]Actually, not really, because we're talking, like, AU.
[39:00.89]We're not talking... We're talking the periodic table.
[39:03.08]That's, like, midway up there.
[39:08.25]I'm Dubai Chocolate 6.
[39:10.37]No, it's... First of all, time the personnel.
[39:13.73]Second of all, it's 5 through 1.
[39:16.34]I gotta clean... Okay, stop.
[39:20.89]Focus.
[39:21.17]I gotta clean the fucking pool.
[39:37.69]And I would make the highest rank in my game, whatever it is, if you achieved it.
[39:44.11]It stopped, it locked you up from playing the game.
[39:47.42]You just get a thing that pops up that says, congratulations.
[39:50.52]You did it.
[39:52.41]And that's it.
[39:54.01]And then you get mailed a plaque.
[39:56.63]That just says, you know, whatever.
[40:00.92]Like...
[40:03.15]Fucking... I don't know, like, Radon 1.
[40:06.42]What's the most powerful fluid in the world?
[40:12.23]And it says, your account has been permanently banned.
[40:14.13]Congratulations, you made it to Radon 1.
[40:38.20]I've been in and out.
[40:38.88]What is he talking about?
[40:39.74]That's, you're fine.
[40:41.16]You don't have to worry about it.
[40:45.91]That is highly toxic.
[40:47.33]Ha, just kidding.
[40:48.09]2D and Noodle are in the Fortnite shop.
[40:50.27]Why do you, why does this person keep saying this?
[41:02.41]That's a gold three comment, to be honest.
[41:07.21]Dude, I should give out ranks.
[41:09.39]No, it would cause so many fucking problems.
[41:11.92]You guys wouldn't be able to handle it.
[41:15.36]If I could, if there were like a hundred ranks for like different badges on this stream, and you had to rank up as a chatter, it would cause, we'd have to delete it in a week.
[41:25.66]You guys could not handle it.
[41:30.68]I would probably get like a five paragraph statement of why this person believes they should be in wood two over wood three.
[41:40.07]We are not doing that.
[41:53.45]Demoting and promoting chatting.
[41:59.30]Yeah, and then when you get to max rank, you get banned from the channel.
[42:03.21]And then I mail you- I mail you a plaque.
[42:13.54]It's not happening.
[42:14.73]Alright, I can hire!
[42:15.79]I'm gonna sleep, I'm gonna wake up, and we're gonna hire.
[42:27.41]Hey, happy early birthday, fellow Virgo.
[42:30.16]Well, I'm a Virgo Libra cusp.
[42:33.26]And I'm having a day today.
[42:34.86]Alright.
[42:48.18]Do I care more about the repairs or the... Probably the concession stand.
[42:54.73]There's nobody even here.
[42:55.48]I can't even hire a concession stand.
[42:59.82]Maybe a cleaner?
[43:02.45]Cleaning is important.
[43:03.51]It really is.
[43:04.03]Oh, this is a restocker.
[43:10.12]That's kind of a big deal.
[43:13.98]Yeah, it costs a research point to do that though, doesn't it?
[43:17.67]I'll do a cleaner.
[43:18.35]I feel like that's really important.
[43:22.39]Restocker is mid.
[43:25.78]I think repairs.
[43:26.99]I can run around and clean.
[43:28.37]We're going to hire Kyler.
[43:32.27]Boom.
[43:34.14]That was just a small boom.
[43:38.20]Alright, let me buy a couple of things.
[43:48.52]What's my moon sign?
[43:49.84]I don't know.
[43:53.06]What else do you got back here?
[44:00.40]Not unlocked yet.
[44:01.70]Not unlocked yet.
[44:04.20]Not unlocked yet.
[44:05.12]Alright, I need lemons.
[44:07.59]And... Hold on, I can do it better.
[44:18.62]Whoa!
[44:21.66]Whoa!
[44:23.01]Delete that whole part of the stream.
[44:24.33]I wish I could do that.
[44:25.25]That's why I used to be a YouTuber.
[44:26.57]Because I would just delete what I just did.
[44:27.85]And like nobody even knew I did it.
[44:33.64]That's why I liked being a YouTuber.
[44:37.89]I would watch stuff back and be like, that was fucking terrible.
[44:41.22]And then I would just drag in Premiere, the, you know, the razor tool, and I would just do it.
[44:46.00]And it'd be gone.
[44:46.64]And no one would even know.
[45:06.58]okay I'm ready it's time to open I need to push more cheaters come on in wait any flyers then you should go be a YouTuber
[45:35.08]I actually have a few videos that I've pretended I was going to make for like a couple of years now.
[45:41.87]I will make a video one day that I think is funny.
[45:45.11]Even if I upload it to a different channel, I don't even care.
[46:02.57]I'm just checking for wristbands.
[46:06.69]nope wait that person cheated why did I not get what what's going on the person didn't pay I caught them already I preemptively caught that person preemptively caught you they have to get in first
[46:44.89]Get in?
[46:45.43]Where are they?
[46:46.03]I'm so confused.
[46:59.15]Careful!
[47:00.37]I gotta fix those slippery stairs.
[47:07.07]You screwed up an order!
[47:08.17]Somebody drowning in the bathroom?
[47:12.88]Wait.
[47:26.19]Nice five bucks for a perfect dive.
[47:31.65]Why are you all drowning today?
[47:36.64]Why are they all drowning?
[47:48.45]What do you want?
[47:50.87]Just take a picture of me.
[47:55.31]I caught a pervert?
[47:58.26]What?
[47:58.54]You were taking pictures of the hot dogs!
[48:01.23]You were taking- You pervert!
[48:02.31]You were taking pictures of the hot dogs!
[48:03.91]And you were trying to- You were trying to hawk those off as real dicks!
[48:07.82]Get outta here!
[48:25.37]Yeah, take a picture of a hot dog.
[48:26.53]Oh look, get the fuck out of here.
[48:30.37]Piece of shit.
[48:42.37]That's a new sentence.
[48:47.14]A local pornographer was caught putting up fake pictures of fake penises on their OnlyFans.
[48:55.78]Turns out they were taking pictures of different hot dogs in different scenarios.
[49:16.88]Local Pornographer.
[49:21.58]He's some kind of community member.
[49:24.23]Oh, it's what a big deal that is.
[49:26.23]Everyone's so broken up about it.
[49:33.34]You know, I'm actually upset about this.
[49:36.24]In our community... When I signed up for that page, I thought I was looking at real dicks.
[49:45.13]But to find out that they were just taking pictures of hot dogs... This has been going on for years, by the way.
[49:52.93]I'm pissed off about it.
[49:58.48]Sir, this is a... This is a meeting about the zoning of the new traffic cones that are going up in front of the mall.
[50:06.95]Yeah, but I mean, remember that?
[50:07.93]You know that guy, right?
[50:21.87]No, hold on.
[50:23.76]That's an action lawsuit.
[50:34.28]Hey, +2, not bad.
[50:37.25]Hey, we're just having fun here, man, okay?
[50:41.29]We're just... Oh, that pool needs to be cleaned.
[50:44.84]That pool is dirty.
[50:50.81]Ah, somebody's drowning.
[50:54.26]Hold on.
[50:59.48]Yeah!
[51:01.68]I should get points for how cool that was.
[51:12.89]I need trashcan.
[51:18.10]Ow, that was loud.
[51:26.28]No, you don't want this.
[51:27.33]Fuck.
[51:33.42]A lot of people... There's too many people drowning.
[51:36.24]I think I need a lifeguard.
[51:38.04]That's more than one person drowning.
[51:41.13]And they're swimming in an infested pool!
[51:43.97]Hold on.
[51:58.97]Any cheaters here?
[52:10.64]What is that guy swimming on the job?
[52:12.02]Oh, never mind.
[52:28.86]I got three grand now.
[52:31.36]Pretty cool.
[52:36.38]Okay, at some point, I need to... I need to push cheaters out of here.
[52:48.92]I'm sorry, there's no hot dogs.
[52:50.76]We're done with hot dogs today.
[52:53.00]No more hot dogs today.
[52:54.88]Not until I push out a couple of cheaters.
[52:59.20]Oh, this fool is gross.
[53:01.81]Hold on.
[53:03.62]Hey!
[53:05.19]Turn around!
[53:34.84]Come on now.
[53:39.95]Let's go.
[53:40.69]Nobody died.
[53:41.31]It's fine.
[53:51.24]People are dying.
[53:56.35]I gotta go.
[54:02.92]Oh, fuck.
[54:05.14]Oh, fuck.
[54:09.61]Okay.
[54:09.73]Shit.
[54:10.39]This person's dead.
[54:11.86]Well, no, they're alive.
[54:12.76]They're alive.
[54:13.08]I can stick them with the alive thing.
[54:16.14]Oh, fuck.
[54:19.23]Watch out!
[54:34.02]Catch up.
[54:42.21]Good?
[54:43.29]How we doing?
[54:43.78]Everybody okay?
[54:46.18]There's something smells over there.
[54:51.01]I need... Can I put a new dumpster in somewhere?
[55:04.14]Is the cheater in the pool right now?
[55:23.62]Where?
[55:32.73]wristband wristband wristband no wristband thank you for using the trash alright one more cheater and I'm at two and a half stars
[56:06.04]That the repair person actually is doing a lot.
[56:08.55]It's actually great.
[56:15.11]Oh shit, never want one.
[56:33.98]I gotta go around and actually pick up random trash on the ground.
[56:37.25]This pool is filthy.
[56:43.08]Is that the only thing that's in this pool?
[56:44.60]No, I thought there was like ten... Oh my god, you're dying.
[56:58.20]Okay.
[57:02.90]Yep.
[57:05.76]OK, less people want lemonade.
[57:07.70]Alright, I got their order wrong and I lashed out.
[57:13.87]I don't.
[57:14.49]I'm sorry I didn't wait.
[57:15.79]They still want one.
[57:20.17]That's OK, we're good.
[57:28.28]I got 3500 bucks.
[57:29.76]I got a bunch of money now.
[57:33.85]89 bucks and tips.
[57:38.77]That works.
[57:44.01]Maintenance.
[57:45.09]Okay.
[57:45.21]I'm imagining expenses is the workers, right?
[57:51.14]Don't I have two workers though?
[57:58.33]I thought I had two workers.
[58:10.59]Maintenance is a fixed cost per building.
[58:14.02]Okay.
[58:14.14]Alright.
[58:14.36]Let me clean up.
[58:15.28]And then I'm going to... I got a bunch of research points.
[58:20.42]Somebody said I need a new floor.
[58:21.56]It's awful.
[58:22.56]I definitely need a new floor.
[58:25.15]Pretty awful looking.
[58:32.28]Have you ever been scrolling through YouTube and you get a recommended video of a beekeeper removing a massive hive with 30,000 bees and end up watching just five beehive removal videos in a row?
[58:42.95]Yeah, that's the algorithm.
[58:47.34]They got you.
[58:50.08]If you're on your third or fourth beehive video, just know they got you.
[59:21.91]But yes, I have been there.
[59:31.98]Some trash in the pool.
[59:33.06]I think this has been here the whole time.
[59:41.65]Okay, should I recycle the water?
[59:44.57]Or is that not really needed?
[60:01.81]Yeah, actually, it might be time for another bathroom.
[60:15.65]What do you think?
[60:16.05]A third bathroom and a third shower?
[60:18.46]I think would go a long way.
[60:20.92]Let's do that first.
[60:28.25]Is somebody in trouble?
[60:29.39]What was that?
[60:37.08]Is somebody in trouble?
[60:37.96]Somebody's hurt.
[60:38.69]Where the hell did my bathroom go?
[60:55.29]I'm trying to make it easier so I can just snap it, but... I don't want to be, like, flush with the... Whatever.
[61:03.34]Where's my bathroom?
[61:04.16]Oh.
[61:11.76]Is there somebody in trouble making weird sounds?
[61:17.89]What am I hearing?
[61:30.60]I need another shower.
[61:35.13]Maybe one over here.
[61:36.19]I'll put two over here.
[61:37.23]I'll put two bathrooms over here and two showers over here.
[61:56.99]Do the floor?
[61:57.69]I will, I will.
[61:58.93]Give me a minute.
[62:18.15]Build these.
[62:27.16]good showers next to the bathroom is gross um shower is in a bathroom you know there's a hole right next to where you take a shower that takes all of your waste and flushes it down the toilet
[62:56.62]There is a hole that you go to the bathroom into, and it's probably a foot or two away from your shower.
[63:03.19]Or maybe a little more, depending on what your bathroom's like.
[63:08.54]When you go to a hotel, do you get annoyed that the shower is next to the bath- the toilet?
[63:15.46]You just ruined my week.
[63:36.68]Real fans already had their week ruined.
[63:43.50]I love how you have to one-up that.
[63:45.20]You have to one-up that somehow.
[63:48.46]A real fan of me?
[63:50.79]What do you mean?
[63:51.35]I want to decipher that one.
[63:54.01]That's a great comment.
[63:56.44]Because what do I have to do with any of that?
[63:59.37]Is... I like that comment.
[64:00.75]That was a funny one.
[64:03.12]You just got... Hey.
[64:04.54]That chatter.
[64:05.78]Congratulations.
[64:06.92]Your XP bar went... And went to 1,000 out of 1,000.
[64:13.07]And you got the next rank.
[64:23.01]Dog Poop 4!
[64:24.97]You made it!
[64:26.07]You made it to Dog Shit 4, dude!
[64:27.93]Hell yeah!
[64:31.40]Dude, you were in Dog Shit 5 for a long time.
[64:36.18]You kept losing out, you kept writing stuff that was just fucked up, and... You had a couple of bangers.
[64:43.71]One got you all the way clo- You got close to Dog Shit 4, but then you... Said all that fucking weird shit.
[64:57.25]Alright, I gotta push the cheater.
[65:10.54]Hmm.
[65:12.74]That's... I just kind of did that, though.
[65:15.21]What about attractions?
[65:21.06]I can't... I kind of... Do you need to get everything?
[65:24.38]Definitely a jukebox.
[65:26.66]I think it's jukebox time.
[65:31.28]That's expensive, but I feel like that's kind of fun.
[65:44.92]What kind of music can I play on it?
[65:54.21]Ooh.
[65:55.17]Definitely more tips.
[65:57.88]and faster stuff alright jukebox the decoration where is it am I crazy if I'm gonna oh it's five thousand dollars
[66:31.31]Well, I don't have that.
[66:33.09]What does it even do?
[66:33.87]Spin the tunes and keep the vibes flowing all day long.
[66:41.26]Well, I'll work towards that.
[66:44.80]My hammer.
[66:46.94]I still have the same staff, I think, right?
[66:48.47]I think I'm good.
[66:49.77]Yeah.
[66:53.29]I need it.
[66:54.71]I'm going to restock and then we're going to go.
[66:57.80]Last cheater and I'll be at two and a half stars.
[67:07.60]What is with this guy?
[67:11.13]Who is this person?
[67:14.09]Oh, okay.
[67:16.36]Do the floor.
[67:18.82]Uh, I'll look into the floor, but it's probably going to be expensive.
[67:32.64]Okay, it's five bucks.
[67:36.32]We'll do a test.
[67:38.52]What the hell did I just do?
[67:39.66]I don't want to do that.
[67:40.78]Change color.
[67:50.84]Can I get a preview of what it looks like?
[67:59.91]Blue?
[68:05.20]Make it green.
[68:06.02]I haven't even unlocked the color green.
[68:17.56]Okay, I kind of want to do it like this.
[68:20.78]Is that too blue?
[68:21.96]Is that too weird?
[68:41.04]It's going to look like an unfinished level.
[68:45.51]I have to commit to it though.
[68:47.11]Can I do a big swath?
[68:48.57]No.
[69:00.06]Do I get a perk for doing this?
[69:02.59]Is this like a good thing to do?
[69:05.07]Actually kind of looks kind of good.
[69:06.25]I like it.
[69:19.11]Oh, so I have to pee.
[69:21.99]I'm going to go pee and fill my coffee up.
[69:26.18]We'll do one half of the park this color.
[69:32.14]I actually don't hate that.
[69:33.01]It actually looks kind of good.
[69:36.25]Alright.
[69:38.29]Alright, I'll be right back.
[69:39.77]I'll give you the music.
[69:46.36]Hey, look at this.
[69:51.76]I told you.
[69:52.86]Alright.
[77:34.71]I returned.
[77:36.96]I made a coffee.
[77:40.79]I made a coffee.
[77:41.91]What's a dot dot dot for?
[77:55.55]What are you doing?
[78:04.09]Bricket noises.
[78:06.03]I wasn't gone for that long, was I?
[78:09.98]Looking at my dashboard.
[78:10.90]I was gone for like 26 minutes.
[78:14.76]Imagine if I took a break that long.
[78:19.27]Alright, what if I turn my stream on?
[78:20.83]Stream for like an hour.
[78:21.53]Said, alright guys, I'll be right back.
[78:23.65]And then I left the stream on for like 12 hours and then came back and just pretended it was a long break.
[78:28.75]Yeah, I'm back.
[78:29.28]I just had to eat some food.
[78:31.90]And I made another coffee.
[78:33.34]But I'm here.
[78:33.82]Let's go.
[78:39.11]oh my god LOL it's so funny it is funny which one of these is the right headphone this one I don't know did you smoke weed uh I did not
[79:11.73]I did not... Ooh.
[79:14.17]I forgot how good this looked.
[79:15.83]Should I just do the whole thing?
[79:18.12]Maybe I'll do green or... Wait.
[79:23.54]I'll go gray.
[79:31.69]That kind of clashes.
[79:33.59]Paint the pools.
[79:38.22]How about dark blue pools?
[79:52.72]Blue and white is nice.
[79:56.23]Yeah, but it kind of... Doesn't it... It feels like it's half the park is... I'll do it.
[80:02.51]Everything is so ugly over here anyways.
[80:03.79]Whatever.
[80:04.19]I'm doing it.
[80:05.56]I can change it later.
[80:21.51]Gets rid of the grass, the moss.
[80:33.32]I got the money, I can do it.
[80:36.08]It looks actually, it looks fine.
[80:46.55]It's probably gonna be easier to see dirt now, which is good.
[80:53.28]Because before, the floors were already dirty.
[80:57.21]So it's hard to pick it up.
[81:04.00]I'll probably get better ratings for this too, right?
[81:07.42]I hope so.
[81:19.90]Ooh!
[81:23.83]okay I don't hate it I don't hate it but we gotta I gotta do the stairs okay wait wait wait wait wait wait uh should I make these kind of like gray or white too that's way better
[82:08.11]Why is it making it blue?
[82:10.83]Does it have to be blue?
[82:15.10]Yeah, I can't do a Neapolitan yet.
[82:16.68]That's the plan, though.
[82:18.26]Oh, it makes it that material.
[82:31.82]I mean, it's a little off, but what is going on there?
[82:35.99]It's fun.
[82:36.59]Who cares?
[82:51.73]Run of the park is the worst.
[83:05.71]I'll spend the money, just wait.
[83:10.81]I can make these a different color?
[83:17.34]What about this kind of darker?
[83:21.83]Nice.
[83:34.70]Yeah.
[83:46.22]Yep.
[83:50.03]Oops.
[83:50.81]Wait.
[83:51.59]I actually like that.
[83:54.09]I like that way better than the other blue.
[84:03.28]Yep.
[84:12.05]Do color theory?
[84:14.07]I don't need to do color.
[84:15.43]Look, I wouldn't have to have color theory right now.
[84:26.95]I'm just doing whatever I want.
[84:29.29]Color theory.
[84:49.29]This is Big J's splash zone.
[84:55.06]I can make it whatever color I want it to be.
[85:15.35]Yeah, and by the way, I can't... All you guys saying, you should do orange, do orange, blue, and you should do green.
[85:20.96]We don't have it unlocked.
[85:23.35]All we have is blue, gray, blue, gray, and then brown.
[85:29.04]I guess I could do this.
[85:31.52]Oh, yeah.
[85:32.12]I actually like it.
[85:57.94]Fuck, how do you undo?
[86:01.03]Go back to this.
[86:10.68]I want to pick another color.
[86:11.88]Wait, that's kind of cool looking though.
[86:15.27]Is it a wave?
[86:15.91]No.
[86:21.14]Why are you painting things mahogany?
[86:23.56]I can only choose between mahogany or blue!
[86:28.89]And I choose mahogany!
[86:37.86]That's good enough.
[86:44.76]Change the secondary color?
[86:48.70]Why would I want it... Oh, BFM?
[86:51.55]I guess I could do... That's gonna look crazy though.
[87:04.14]try it that just cost five bucks for me to do that I actually that's so weird looking I love it it looks fucked up but I kind of I'm kind of vibing with it
[87:34.52]Whoa, that's kind of... Dude, no.
[87:40.18]Should I make the pool just like... Should I make the pool just black?
[87:47.51]Okay, we're working here.
[87:48.87]I don't want to spend all my money.
[88:02.63]I think it looks fine.
[88:06.01]Way more important shit going on than that.
[88:27.40]Should I paint these?
[88:28.88]Maybe do... I think it's one of all this.
[88:32.63]Is that what they already are?
[88:35.37]Now that's what I call, that's a shower.
[88:37.99]Or maybe white.
[88:41.74]Make everything black.
[89:00.01]Hmm.
[89:00.11]I feel like this should be this color.
[89:03.03]Yeah.
[89:05.19]What about these?
[89:06.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[89:07.85]This is bathroom.
[89:08.45]This is the bathroom.
[89:13.14]I hate that though.
[89:21.93]Make it brown?
[89:23.03]Make it mahogany.
[89:33.59]Alright, fine.
[89:36.61]This looks like an error.
[89:38.39]Alright, this looks like a manufacturing error.
[89:48.89]Mahogany outhouse.
[89:50.67]Alright.
[89:51.41]I don't have time for this.
[89:52.37]I gotta get some more stuff.
[89:59.38]I need more decorations.
[90:03.11]What is this?
[90:03.53]Fountain?
[90:03.79]Fountain?
[90:07.63]That's kind of fun.
[90:08.51]Maybe like put it in between everybody.
[90:12.72]Kind of small.
[90:19.96]How expensive are these?
[90:20.66]100 bucks?
[90:40.92]I have a big planter.
[90:59.02]Oh, you're building it.
[90:59.66]Nice.
[91:03.00]Whoa!
[91:03.94]That's perfect!
[91:04.64]Is that- oh wait, that's actually kind of- wait.
[91:06.36]There needs to be a little splash place.
[91:16.76]Alright, these that might be not be great, but.
[91:20.81]These are going to be colored blue.
[91:24.58]Because this is the.
[91:27.89]The relax and let the water hit you in the face chairs.
[91:49.53]Oh, I love my mahogany park.
[91:52.16]Okay, cool.
[91:53.64]Change this back to white.
[92:02.27]Now what about the front of the park?
[92:08.13]Oh my god, it's so ugly.
[92:10.20]Okay.
[92:11.68]How do we get people to want to... I need some... I'm doing... No.
[92:14.86]Other colors besides fucking gray, guys.
[92:29.53]The whole park is going to look like this.
[92:31.15]I'm not... It's going to spend... I'm going to spend like 500 bucks doing that.
[92:34.65]And the second I unlock new colors, I'm going to change it.
[92:44.79]Millennial gray?
[92:45.63]No, it's nautical.
[92:47.97]Nautical gray.
[92:49.69]Time that person out.
[93:05.17]Holy shit, that's cool.
[93:15.18]That's perfect for the outside.
[93:16.38]Yeah, now this is a water park.
[93:23.01]Right.
[93:24.55]Exactly.
[93:30.52]Or it will be eventually.
[93:41.04]I got new windows in here.
[93:43.71]Wait.
[93:44.77]Mahogany.
[94:32.82]I'll finish the rest later.
[94:36.56]This is ugly.
[94:37.16]I'm sorry.
[94:37.64]I know it's ugly.
[94:38.62]It's temporary.
[94:42.21]Hey.
[94:43.75]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[94:48.70]We need access to more colors.
[94:49.82]But I just don't want the dirty factor to play in.
[94:51.96]For people to say this is like an ugly park.
[94:53.82]There's no paint.
[94:56.30]This is temporary.
[94:59.77]Until I can unlock the other paints.
[95:21.31]I love how dumb it is No shit, I didn't want to do that Big J's ugly roof Keep it?
[95:36.27]I'm keeping it because I think it's funny
[96:25.86]No.
[96:27.88]What color should the sign be?
[96:37.54]Make it white?
[96:46.29]Yellow?
[96:47.75]I don't have the colors I want!
[96:57.91]Okay.
[97:00.05]Looking good.
[97:01.15]Wait, I gotta finish this.
[97:06.44]Alright, that's good for now.
[97:07.14]That's good.
[97:07.48]Temporary.
[97:08.10]They come in and they can turn around and see how helpful it is.
[97:21.20]Alright, it's fine, it's fine, it's fine.
[97:22.36]No more money.
[97:22.78]I'm done spending money.
[97:24.10]One more.
[97:24.58]Right here.
[97:26.73]That's it.
[97:27.31]Alright, I'm done.
[97:29.47]One more over here.
[97:32.30]I have to get the whole thing.
[97:37.08]This looks like a children's museum.
[97:40.61]Yeah, water park kind of is a children's museum, alright?
[97:45.37]It's a bunch of kids running around, pissing in pools, eating hot dogs with both, you know, with their... What do you want me to say?
[97:52.14]A lot of kids are at a water park.
[98:08.51]Eating chips.
[98:09.61]Screaming.
[98:12.20]Going to get ice cream.
[98:13.34]I want Dippin' Dots.
[98:14.30]This is a children's museum.
[98:22.93]A fair trade.
[98:34.50]Welcome to Kmart.
[98:52.34]It reminds me of something.
[98:56.24]Whoa.
[98:56.96]I actually kind of like how weird it is.
[99:00.21]I like it.
[99:05.68]Alright.
[99:05.86]Throw the trash away, then open the park.
[99:07.36]And I need to make some money.
[99:08.29]I need to push one more person.
[99:12.13]Everything's clean, right?
[99:13.64]Wait.
[99:13.76]Wait.
[99:27.89]What has he been doing over here all day?
[99:38.87]Alright, I'm good.
[99:40.19]Open it up.
[99:42.18]Everything's clean.
[99:42.80]Everything looks decent.
[99:47.21]Go.
[100:06.50]Dude, eventually I'm gonna do green and orange.
[100:09.39]One of my favorite color schemes.
[100:19.42]A light green.
[100:23.02]And that deep orange.
[100:27.26]Okay, I gotta get in there.
[100:31.31]One more cheater and I'm good.
[100:36.24]Cheat!
[100:36.80]Cheat!
[100:48.29]Where is this guy?
[100:54.31]Wait, I don't know.
[100:54.83]Where did he go?
[100:58.30]Okay, I got it.
[101:00.06]Right now your water park's flooring is plain and forgettable, but you're not here to be average.
[101:03.76]Unlock the floor tool.
[101:06.54]I already did that.
[101:10.47]Okay, make the floor more beautiful.
[101:12.27]Oh my god, I just did this!
[101:14.15]I would have leveled up again!
[101:15.55]It's fine.
[101:26.71]Should I just do it now?
[101:28.23]No.
[101:29.13]I'm too busy to do it now.
[101:35.69]Everyone's having a good time?
[101:46.12]What are you?
[101:56.75]Do you like the fountains?
[101:59.63]Okay, I don't know what you're doing exactly, but you're not helping.
[102:06.57]Should I push him?
[102:14.62]Okay, he was glitched out.
[102:15.44]I got him out of whatever he was doing.
[102:21.93]He's trying to escape.
[102:27.01]He's trying to tunnel down.
[102:28.13]Poop.
[102:41.80]How do I clean this?
[102:54.74]Everyone got a wristband?
[102:57.28]This is a popular attraction, look at this.
[103:10.61]We're good.
[103:11.05]Already back at a thousand.
[103:18.70]Everyone having fun?
[103:28.91]Dude, you gotta get more people in here, man.
[103:30.73]Let me help you, please.
[103:31.57]The lion out the door.
[103:35.81]How do we... I gotta help him.
[103:59.28]Trying to go for no finds today and no complaints.
[104:04.38]Keep my eye out for clean trash cans, right?
[104:07.83]Just stay proactive about it.
[104:13.21]Puddles.
[104:14.26]Okay, puddle, puddle, puddle, puddle.
[104:16.84]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[104:17.44]Watch out.
[104:23.17]The bars are good.
[104:36.06]A lot of plain hot dog eaters today.
[104:40.37]Crash, good.
[104:42.13]Yep.
[104:47.22]Getting a bunch of tips.
[104:54.29]This guy is obsessed with this spot.
[105:10.10]These showers are going unused.
[105:13.09]Not even used, come on.
[105:17.37]I think I need to buy more chairs to get more people in the park.
[105:41.49]What's dirty?
[105:44.07]What's dirty?
[105:44.65]One of these loungers is dirty.
[105:51.17]Like really dirty?
[105:52.37]I can't even tell.
[105:53.07]They're all clean.
[105:57.85]What?
[106:18.26]Which one of these is dirty?
[106:23.40]I mean that's dirty.
[106:33.36]The trash can.
[106:42.39]This game is fun.
[106:52.24]I had to give this to you.
[106:55.65]Oh.
[106:55.73]What do you want?
[107:10.10]Both.
[107:13.09]Somebody's drowning.
[107:16.29]Oh fuck.
[107:17.41]More than one person is drowning.
[107:20.26]They're both in the same pool.
[107:25.12]Uh-oh!
[107:26.06]I fell behind the dumpster!
[107:41.01]Okay.
[107:50.98]Lemon?
[107:51.84]You got it?
[107:52.56]Here you go.
[107:54.53]Okay.
[108:02.20]You have to hire more staff?
[108:03.50]I'm only allowed to have two people right now.
[108:17.24]Is the guy even selling tickets?
[108:19.49]What are you doing?!
[108:20.41]!
[108:38.42]There's been people say no wonder I was like, why are they nobody in here?
[108:41.13]This pool is dirty.
[109:01.59]But throwing you shit on the ground.
[109:17.03]Here.
[109:19.20]Okay, I gotta clean.
[109:25.12]You're running the McDonald's like the Navy?
[109:27.05]What does that mean?
[109:36.86]Yep.
[109:38.24]I still got it.
[109:53.16]Somebody's dying Get out of my way
[110:23.10]Yeah, this guy cannot help himself.
[110:33.85]Max screwed up an order for a visitor.
[110:36.05]What is Max up?
[110:37.10]What are you?
[110:42.46]That guy is fucking up everything right now.
[110:47.49]How do I change back to first person?
[111:01.20]Give me the hot dog!
[111:02.22]Feed it to him!
[111:07.41]Oh my god, dude!
[111:10.31]No, wait!
[111:10.88]I'll deliver it to you!
[111:12.12]Oh, he wants a hot dog instead, okay.
[111:16.24]It's V?
[111:17.21]Yes, it's V. No!
[111:26.34]No!
[111:37.90]Wait.
[111:49.14]How we doing over here?
[111:49.74]I've neglected over here big time.
[111:56.18]There we go.
[111:56.92]Alright.
[111:57.63]A hundred and look at all these tips today.
[111:59.27]200 bucks in tips.
[112:04.25]I got a bunch of things to research.
[112:11.44]Uh, park is closed.
[112:29.44]Uh, hey, Max.
[112:32.49]Something going on with you today.
[112:34.31]What's up?
[112:40.11]Something's going on here.
[112:41.11]What's going on here?
[112:45.15]That's the second or third time he's just staring at the wall.
[112:55.91]I need hot dogs.
[112:57.23]What can I research?
[113:01.42]I feel like I need this.
[113:03.60]Either that or... Finally can unlock paint colors.
[113:13.37]Ooh.
[113:16.61]Cashier training level one.
[113:21.59]I can do more.
[113:22.54]No, I don't want to do that yet.
[113:32.05]Okay.
[113:35.13]So I should have... Does he learn it or do I have to hire somebody new?
[113:41.88]Okay, Max is level two.
[113:50.41]Finally, I have some more colors.
[113:51.73]Okay, let's do... I love that color.
[114:05.17]That.
[114:07.35]And what's secondary?
[114:10.95]That in white?
[114:15.44]Or that in red?
[114:28.04]I think I like the white.
[114:29.14]That and white looks good.
[114:38.93]Cool, okay.
[114:41.11]Can I do Neapolitan yet?
[114:46.24]Yes, I can.
[114:54.23]What is Neapolitan?
[114:54.87]Neapolitan is strawberry in the middle?
[114:56.53]Where's strawberry?
[115:10.60]I got it right?
[115:13.88]I think it needs to be darker.
[115:37.09]That thing is fucked.
[115:52.40]I don't know if the Neapolitan ice cream is gonna work, guys.
[116:00.27]Everything needs to be cleaned up.
[116:19.85]I need faster cleaning.
[116:24.58]Oh my god, it scared the shit out of me.
[116:31.99]Where's my repairman?
[116:36.31]Yeah, I'm not doing a bigger park until it's certain that I can handle it.
[116:50.69]Okay, let's start over here.
[116:51.65]Oh my god.
[117:12.05]I actually kind of don't hate it.
[117:32.17]I think this needs to be a much brighter, less muted pink.
[117:59.31]Make everything gray.
[118:03.73]I feel like I would laugh at that for a second, and then I would be mad that I spend $1,000 doing that.
[118:29.86]I can't have a Neapolitan pool.
[118:39.13]Okay.
[118:44.46]This needs to be... this.
[118:48.99]I don't love that, though.
[118:49.95]That's a little too... a little too harsh.
[119:23.94]Now that's looking more like a Neapolitan.
[119:36.84]Ew, ew.
[119:37.80]Yeah, whatever.
[119:38.86]I don't care, okay?
[119:41.78]It's a fun scheme for me.
[119:47.97]Back to brown.
[119:49.01]I didn't go away from brown.
[119:52.46]It's the floor that's screwing it up.
[119:54.22]The floor needs to... I need to do the floor.
[119:57.27]I gotta do the floor anyways for the achievement.
[120:04.08]The white floor, I think.
[120:05.06]Yes.
[120:15.88]Mint floor?
[120:17.10]What about the...
[120:21.54]Oh, I kind of like it.
[120:23.48]I kind of like it.
[120:26.35]No, hold on.
[120:27.65]Are we stupid?
[120:33.98]We're making a Neapolitan.
[120:36.79]I don't know why I'm on the Neapolitan thing today, but I am.
[120:40.09]Do you know what I mean?
[120:40.63]It's going to be one giant Neap- I love that ice cream.
[120:53.43]Should it be this way or that way?
[121:02.37]Wait.
[121:02.87]Oh, yeah.
[121:31.90]I'm keeping it.
[121:46.49]It's way too much chocolate in this.
[121:48.35]I can fix it.
[121:49.63]I would be pissed too if I opened up a Neapolitan.
[121:52.41]And the ratio was off.
[122:16.78]It's half chocolate.
[122:17.84]I'm gonna fix it.
[122:24.89]Hold on.
[122:25.07]It's so stupid.
[122:27.01]That is way too much chocolate.
[122:28.47]You're right.
[122:28.84]Just wait.
[122:37.61]Can you make the strawberry lighter?
[122:38.81]I can't yet.
[122:40.67]I will be able to eventually.
[122:41.90]One of these ones.
[122:42.50]That one here.
[122:55.42]It really does kinda look like Candy Land.
[123:00.03]Should I go across the whole park?
[123:02.37]I think I'm gonna do it.
[123:03.53]I'm- I'm in- I'm in for it.
[123:15.29]And then it has to tran- okay, it's gonna transfer into mint chocolate.
[123:19.19]It's gonna be an ice cream- okay, mint.
[123:22.14]Where does it transfer?
[123:29.17]So this is Neapolitan, then we're going to the mint chocolate chip.
[123:38.76]Hey, hold on.
[123:40.22]What about like this?
[123:41.79]I feel like every other square.
[123:47.93]Or just kind of random because it's like mint chocolate chip.
[124:25.51]What are you doing?
[124:26.34]I want to paint this.
[124:38.18]Oh, it's not paint.
[124:50.86]Make it brown.
[124:52.58]Black might translate a little better.
[124:55.13]I agree with you though.
[125:09.77]I guess the chairs could be the chocolate chips.
[125:23.94]Let's paint.
[125:24.70]Okay, hold on.
[125:26.66]Let me at least get all this down.
[125:27.76]This is messed up.
[125:55.91]The only brown in a water park should be the poop in the pool.
[126:11.06]It's funny, as I've gotten older, the concept of a water park just kind of disgusts me.
[126:17.25]Is that weird?
[126:19.55]When I think of a water park now, I don't think of a fun time.
[126:22.29]I think of...
[126:36.19]That's it.
[126:36.66]That's the only thought that goes in my mind.
[126:47.21]Hey, sitting out in the hot sun, it's gonna be great to sit in one of these chairs.
[127:00.99]People are gonna get burnt.
[127:04.59]My god.
[127:13.02]Oh, stop.
[127:33.81]Hmm.
[127:57.11]Cool.
[128:18.17]Let me fix everything.
[128:22.52]Do a black slide so everybody burns their skin off.
[128:30.67]Alright, what's next in the ice cream park?
[128:35.50]This has got to also probably move.
[128:38.49]We got the entrance is going to be Neapolitan.
[128:41.13]Alright, you come down.
[128:41.88]It's like, oh my God, I could really go for one of those.
[128:44.02]Mint chocolate over here.
[128:44.92]And then maybe more chocolate chips, more chocolate chips.
[128:52.42]Hold on.
[129:32.39]I do need to do... I guess there's some orange in here.
[129:57.68]Orange creamsicle world?
[129:58.66]I'm right there with you.
[130:03.15]I'm gonna do orange creamsicle next.
[130:29.79]I feel like they need to be white too.
[130:31.29]Some of these should be white maybe?
[130:35.28]Maybe just be all green.
[130:36.72]I don't know.
[130:37.02]How do you feel about that?
[130:37.77]I feel like this is out of place.
[130:39.79]Out of place.
[130:49.14]I think it's going to be all green.
[131:13.99]OK.
[131:18.18]Why these chairs look still?
[131:19.20]They look dirty still.
[131:22.62]Did it just come like that?
[131:23.77]Why do they look so dirty?
[131:34.62]I guess they're just dirty, alright.
[131:41.80]Do I have an orange?
[131:42.78]Like a brighter orange?
[131:43.68]I don't think so.
[131:44.38]I'll do those later.
[131:50.36]Alright, cool.
[131:53.46]This needs to be fixed.
[131:57.51]Uh-oh.
[132:02.00]That's cutting into my Neapolitan.
[132:22.71]Can I paint the hot dog stand?
[132:29.99]You can.
[132:30.39]Too bad this isn't ice cream.
[133:09.72]Oh, cute.
[133:16.17]And we're going to come down to Big J's Ice Cream Land.
[133:46.34]That's a whole nother can of worms.
[133:48.29]I'm not doing that right now.
[133:50.86]Okay, I think I'm ready.
[133:55.47]Everything clean.
[134:22.16]uh zero contrast I think it's the other way yeah
[134:57.53]Alright, I got tons of chairs, tons of stuff.
[135:00.18]Plenty of bathrooms.
[135:01.54]I got a theme going here.
[135:06.43]Plenty of room.
[135:07.17]I'm going to put another pool here, I think.
[135:09.35]Something else should go right here.
[135:12.09]What can I even do?
[135:16.50]Look at how cool that is.
[135:21.83]Another pool.
[135:26.49]No.
[135:26.77]No.
[135:31.10]Something has to go there.
[135:32.94]Maybe more seating?
[135:36.86]And like an umbrella in the middle?
[136:00.38]It's alright.
[136:03.36]Put them all under it.
[136:16.82]Put it in the bottom right corner.
[136:22.52]Doubters just had a heart attack after seeing the aerial view.
[136:26.65]I know, right?
[136:31.44]Like over here?
[136:34.61]That's not a bad idea.
[136:48.15]I don't think it fits.
[136:59.73]It's the center of shame.
[137:01.41]Why would it be the center of shame?
[137:03.88]It's just a place to hang out for a second.
[137:41.32]No.
[137:43.31]Do they be brown?
[138:13.39]Glicksong is out and this guy's painting lawn chairs.
[138:17.23]I played Hollow Knight in like 2017 and I only got like 30% of the way through the game.
[138:36.14]Is there anything that we can do to make you play Club Penguin?
[138:39.34]Are the servers even turned on in Club Penguin?
[138:43.25]I love that.
[138:44.03]I love they're all facing away from each other.
[139:01.26]Alright, restock.
[139:03.02]Open.
[139:07.17]And clean graffiti.
[139:24.88]Now I'm ready.
[139:31.77]You need more staff.
[139:32.77]I can only have two.
[139:35.42]What's the path to get another person here?
[139:42.99]Hiring level three.
[139:45.05]I need to get three stars.
[139:50.54]Ooh, wait a minute.
[139:54.15]I'm doing that for now.
[139:58.53]Fastest hot dog shooter in the Northwest.
[140:01.72]I haven't seen anybody do it like this before.
[140:04.52]I can do it quick.
[140:07.64]I'm just saying.
[140:11.55]I can do it quick.
[140:17.16]That's still one of the best videos ever made.
[140:20.58]I've never seen anybody do it like this before.
[140:29.25]I'm just saying.
[140:32.69]I mean, that guy had every right to act like that.
[140:36.05]That was very humble, right?
[140:38.78]I'm just saying.
[140:40.58]What he was trying to say is, there ain't nobody as good as me.
[140:44.68]Nobody's better than me at this.
[140:46.42]And you all know it.
[140:48.13]I don't have to, do I have to say anything?
[140:52.43]That's what he was saying.
[140:55.60]They do have aura.
[140:57.91]I mean... And eating hot dogs really fast.
[141:01.85]Yeah, I guess.
[141:05.98]Alright, I'm opening this door.
[141:07.50]Let's go.
[141:08.32]I have to sleep first.
[141:12.51]Alright, I'm turning this music off.
[141:14.03]Block of Seagulls is on the way.
[141:17.29]No, the music's new.
[141:20.38]Where's my cleaning brush?
[141:36.95]Oh it's snowing!
[141:37.89]Stick your tongue out and catch a snowflake.
[141:51.00]Everybody get in here!
[141:51.84]Hey everyone!
[141:56.73]Get in here!
[141:58.35]Hey everyone!
[142:00.41]Hey everyone!
[142:01.23]Get in!
[142:01.83]Get in here!
[142:03.11]Here!
[142:03.49]Hey everyone!
[142:11.02]That made me quit the game.
[142:13.70]And I never went back.
[142:15.17]I play Battleground sometimes.
[142:31.29]Dude, Naxx is out.
[142:37.01]You know what?
[142:37.93]I can talk some shit about Hearthstone, but that game, it was fun.
[142:44.00]The first, like, two or three years of Hearthstone was like, oh my god, dude, who they adding?
[142:50.09]Oh, MechaTorque!
[142:52.31]No way!
[142:53.27]MechaTorque, what does he have for, he summons a random funny guy!
[142:58.12]It was awesome.
[143:17.93]Patron was the best fucking deck in Hearthstone history.
[143:20.51]It made you quit.
[143:22.69]I just made that up.
[143:23.49]I don't know.
[143:23.83]I probably played it for a long time after that.
[143:26.02]I just made that up.
[143:32.26]Magic the Gathering is better.
[143:38.41]But aren't we talking... I mean, isn't Magic the... Okay, Magic the Gathering... It's like learning a new language at that point, right?
[144:01.21]magic is touring complete what that guy said alright what game would you give the aliens alien show up they say we're here and we are needing fun our planet we don't have fun things anymore
[144:33.82]But we heard Earth has so many moves.
[144:36.24]We've heard of the Super Nintendo Entertainment System.
[144:39.06]Should we play that first?
[144:41.74]We've heard of Dodgeball.
[144:43.67]Is that fun?
[144:44.45]What is that?
[144:45.39]Somebody took a picture.
[144:45.97]Hold on.
[144:54.96]They can play Heroes of the Storm?
[144:56.98]No.
[145:01.29]Absolutely not.
[145:13.35]Everybody else dirty?
[145:19.20]Give them League of Legends so they don't come back.
[145:28.30]Ah, that would be bad.
[145:29.08]If we give them League of Legends, they might just kill us all.
[145:35.11]This is the entertainment we've heard about for so many years.
[145:52.86]I think you give them Monopoly.
[145:57.48]I think it's Monopoly.
[146:00.95]I think you start them with Monopoly.
[146:13.76]I think they'd be too aggr- like, no, no, it can't be something easy.
[146:16.20]Like, oh, tag!
[146:17.78]No, I think they'd be too aggressive.
[146:20.21]They're like, oh, okay, so we push, we push and hurt and enslave the human race?
[146:25.32]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[146:36.33]Hold on.
[146:42.96]Who do I save?
[146:51.57]Let's escape Monopoly.
[146:54.69]Who's this funny Earth man I see?
[146:57.45]With the monocle.
[147:06.56]Fill it up.
[147:16.13]Would you commit to a five hour gameplay of Monopoly?
[147:18.41]No.
[147:23.83]I'm not sure I would commit to a one-hour game of Monopoly.
[147:28.60]Unless it's for the Super Nintendo.
[147:30.24]That was the best... Because you get that banger theme song.
[147:42.49]You know what?
[147:42.97]Hold on.
[147:49.00]I think if you showed the aliens this, don't... You have them play the Super NES Monopoly.
[148:02.07]Or you give them the auction song.
[148:09.82]Hold on a sec.
[148:23.79]What is this, Earthling?
[148:26.30]I want to get up and move!
[148:28.34]I want to dance to this!
[148:37.91]You know, when we first showed up here, I was thinking about obliterating you with a laser beam.
[148:43.22]But something about this is making me second-guess that.
[148:45.38]And what's these funny houses?
[148:48.51]Oh, you put those on and you can sell and rent and you can buy property and... Property?
[148:54.10]What is that?
[148:54.54]You can put a hotel up and then people... Well, that sounds fucking terrible.
[149:12.76]Erkling!
[149:15.04]What is this?
[149:21.17]Somebody's drowning.
[149:36.80]I love this game.
[149:37.60]It's so good for the Super Nintendo.
[149:42.68]Why are people running?
[149:43.92]Did you do something?
[149:51.63]There's poop everywhere.
[150:01.35]That's during the auction.
[150:02.47]I'm going to play this on stream.
[150:06.73]I'm going to play Monopoly for the Super Nintendo on stream.
[150:10.18]This is going to be sick.
[150:15.65]Okay.
[150:24.24]Auto tickets.
[150:25.49]Oh, auto.
[150:26.93]Unlock the ticket ATM via the research tree.
[150:30.49]And it will handle ticket sales automatically.
[150:33.60]Just a heads up, it only takes cards, so guests with cash will still have to go to the counter.
[150:37.30]Okay.
[150:40.50]I need ticket machine research.
[150:45.96]Oh no!
[151:07.43]Waited too long for a ticket.
[151:10.16]What is happening?
[151:21.33]What do you want?
[151:21.81]Uh oh, that's bad.
[151:41.04]Somebody help this guy, I can't!
[151:45.75]Any cheaters?
[151:51.37]Am I gonna play Halo 2?
[151:53.13]Probably never.
[151:53.77]I don't think I'll ever play Halo 2.
[151:59.96]Ever.
[152:08.17]It's not that I don't like Halo 2.
[152:10.93]It's just that everything... Everything that could be in front of Halo 2 is currently in front of Halo 2.
[152:18.62]Does that make sense?
[152:21.91]And this list is probably... I'd say it's probably 100 meters long.
[152:36.79]Did that guy just steal from me?
[152:41.72]You stole from me!
[153:00.64]Back up over two grand.
[153:01.54]That's good.
[153:07.71]I got to clean some more.
[153:08.65]This person smells.
[153:11.47]Spam clicked to clean faster?
[153:14.27]Is that legit?
[153:15.47]Are they making that up?
[153:19.64]See, are they making it up?
[153:27.08]I feel like he made that up.
[153:31.20]It's a rhythm?
[153:35.82]Oh.
[153:35.90]It's already puked.
[154:05.15]You cheated.
[154:05.81]Everybody else stink?
[154:31.07]That's disgusting.
[154:38.75]I'm here, I'm here.
[154:54.75]Somebody's drowning.
[154:55.45]Shit.
[155:04.05]Nice, okay, good.
[155:08.89]Can you add Jurassic Park Operation Genesis to your games to play list?
[155:15.11]Maybe.
[155:27.55]Did this person just put graffiti about how long the wait is for a hot dog?
[155:35.15]What did that just say?
[155:45.86]Alright, that could have gone better.
[155:47.77]But it's okay.
[155:48.87]Got two grand now.
[155:58.62]Thank you for coming.
[156:00.50]Please make your way to your vehicles except for you.
[156:10.32]Okay.
[156:13.84]Decorations.
[156:16.37]break if graffiti changed anything it could be okay I don't know if I'm ready for the park being bigger probably this I feel like I use attraction decorations walk speed and oh definitely patience good where's that life stand ring
[156:57.51]Do these have to be in the pool?
[157:00.82]I can put it in the pool.
[157:01.66]That's kind of perfect, right?
[157:10.31]One next to each pool.
[157:24.21]Oh my god, this place is disgusting.
[157:27.87]Are you a happy streamer?
[157:30.36]Are you a sad chatter?
[157:41.93]Don't tell me you're a sad chatter.
[157:55.75]Nobody's still here.
[157:59.41]You can leave now.
[158:02.94]Where'd that bag of trash just go?
[158:18.73]Where's that bag of trash?
[158:32.17]Come on, man.
[158:44.88]I need my hammer.
[158:46.92]Because that guy is not doing it.
[159:05.24]okay okay fix the pool there we go hooray
[159:52.02]Why are these things in such good shape?
[160:15.26]This makes me so thrilled.
[160:16.98]I'm glad.
[160:20.82]There was trash in the other pool, right?
[160:29.30]Look at all this junk.
[160:42.18]It's popular over here, but what the hell?
[160:44.92]Clean up after yourselves.
[161:03.33]Damn it, I was trying to throw it over the fence.
[161:09.59]Well, I'll just wait till it's needed.
[161:15.74]Oh boy, alright, I need my mop.
[161:37.52]It's how I get the better ratings.
[161:52.14]Good.
[162:06.85]Do you have a Neapolitan right now?
[162:08.03]Neapolitan is great.
[162:10.99]I forget just how wonderful it really is.
[162:14.22]Cookies and Cream is up there as well.
[162:33.66]You gotta do a lot of shit before each day.
[162:40.62]When this park gets even bigger... Am I still gonna have to do all this?
[162:46.74]I guess I could hire people, but am I gonna make enough money?
[162:58.03]You need a janitor?
[163:00.85]I gotta get to that level 3 employee thing.
[163:06.14]Alright, that's good enough.
[163:09.18]We're ready.
[163:12.04]This has been restocked the lemons.
[163:15.34]I need new hot dogs.
[163:21.07]That's as good as it's gonna get.
[163:30.35]You do get a good experience from cleaning up.
[163:36.96]Okay, what did I unlock?
[163:41.57]Okay.
[163:52.32]I don't think I can do anything here.
[163:53.43]No, I'm not doing this yet.
[163:55.49]That would be so bad.
[164:05.98]Sounds good.
[164:09.47]So they need less maintenance now?
[164:16.42]Alright, new day.
[164:23.41]Oh, Poppy.
[164:26.83]You need park decorations, too, for your ticket machine stuff.
[164:33.68]Okay.
[164:42.17]Wait, hot dogs.
[164:56.93]What do you mean I can only carry one?
[164:58.64]Can I carry more than one?
[165:02.50]What?
[165:03.38]I can only hold one in my hands?
[165:15.30]Grandpa!
[165:29.38]Alright, begin.
[165:30.20]I got my ticket scanner here.
[166:06.66]Sorry.
[166:07.20]I thought I was far enough away.
[166:12.06]I was very far away.
[166:28.96]I'm ready.
[166:35.47]I heard another laugh.
[166:42.42]I gotta hand out flyers.
[166:50.57]There's nobody here.
[167:11.74]Ah.
[167:14.02]I need more people to show up.
[167:17.81]What is it, a Tuesday or something?
[167:19.01]Why is nobody here?
[167:22.40]There's six people in the park.
[167:40.78]It's a slow day.
[167:43.51]Alright, here we go.
[167:44.35]Here comes everybody.
[167:55.30]They all want to go.
[167:58.95]Okay, well.
[168:00.85]Let them in.
[168:04.99]Oh, people want food.
[168:06.36]I'm doing it.
[168:06.90]I'm going.
[168:09.84]Can I change the price of the lemonade?
[168:11.14]Can I make it expensive?
[168:11.84]Okay.
[168:22.93]How's that for service?
[168:24.11]I'm right here.
[168:24.75]Okay, I'm definitely hiring a concession person after this.
[168:57.45]I'm looking out for wristbands.
[169:14.32]I want to make a crazy slide too.
[169:20.32]Alright, clean up a little.
[169:23.89]Everything looks good.
[169:30.10]Hello.
[169:31.25]Catch up.
[169:39.88]I really should not go too far away from this.
[169:41.77]It's such a moneymaker.
[169:48.10]I heard somebody laugh.
[169:50.44]It was you.
[169:57.16]Can you make custom slides eventually?
[169:58.78]Um, I don't know.
[170:01.82]Maybe?
[170:09.09]Alright, the life, uh... The life preservers are great.
[170:20.71]I gotta clean.
[170:21.81]Stay in front of it.
[170:26.33]If I see anything on the ground, I gotta start going.
[170:32.14]We're looking for as little spills and falls as possible here.
[170:43.51]Okay, good.
[170:49.94]What about over here?
[170:51.26]Yep.
[170:53.35]Milk versus dark chocolate.
[170:55.51]Dark chocolate is better for you.
[170:59.82]But milk chocolate hits pretty hard.
[171:01.54]I do love a good milk chocolate.
[171:13.56]Hit that trash immediately.
[171:20.64]I'm running out of hot dogs.
[171:21.78]Not good.
[171:23.02]No, I've been under the batch.
[171:29.29]Somebody got hurt.
[171:32.13]Flip.
[171:34.99]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[171:38.16]Where's my mop?
[171:40.20]What's going on with that guy?
[171:47.55]Basic lounger is dirty?
[171:51.53]Where?
[171:55.14]These are all clean.
[171:58.84]Why would it?
[171:59.26]It's not dirty.
[171:59.87]You're a liar.
[172:08.04]Why are they full of shit?
[172:08.82]I don't get it.
[172:22.45]My grenade!
[172:29.02]Just ice?
[172:29.54]Yep.
[172:35.89]Get the fuck out of here!
[172:42.16]They're so... They just fly under the radar.
[172:44.80]I just never see them doing this.
[173:00.45]That is what you ordered actually.
[173:07.81]Oh no, Max is screwing up again.
[173:29.61]This has been a pretty good day so far though.
[173:31.49]I'm not messing up that much.
[173:49.25]This is where all the negative reviews come from.
[173:53.68]They lay down and then they fall over.
[173:56.72]Because they...
[173:59.09]Can I replenish this?
[174:03.40]They lay down wet, they get up and fall down.
[174:06.64]And then they blame me for that.
[174:12.39]Which is crazy.
[174:25.63]Okay.
[174:25.75]It's all clean.
[174:26.95]I need more hot dogs.
[174:31.34]3500.
[174:31.84]Holy shit.
[174:32.56]Nice.
[174:41.28]Do I have time to get a hot dog?
[174:44.64]I need a lifeguard.
[174:45.24]I don't even think I have a lifeguard unlocked yet.
[174:49.43]It's probably further up in the tree.
[174:52.29]Alright.
[174:52.53]I'm going to go get hot dogs.
[174:59.88]Fuck off.
[175:00.78]I've left so many brooms in this guy's door, it's ridiculous.
[175:03.52]Here.
[175:11.97]Here.
[175:17.60]Come to the splash zone.
[175:29.66]Spill it!
[175:31.79]Oh my god, did I even put ice in it?
[175:34.93]I thought I just put it on the ground.
[175:40.34]Okay.
[175:41.07]What's broken?
[175:45.94]One of these is apparently broken.
[175:58.58]I do like how this game is a lot of just busy work.
[176:01.77]Fun just to run around and do everything.
[176:21.04]What did I get in there?
[176:28.66]Shit.
[176:29.76]Please don't fall again.
[176:33.81]Fuck.
[176:34.35]I need to... There are a hundred brooms lying around here somewhere.
[176:59.17]I hope they do despawn.
[177:10.78]Whoa!
[177:28.38]Good ratings today.
[177:30.12]Good ratings today.
[177:33.94]Much better than usual.
[177:39.91]I got a ton of money.
[177:42.49]Bunch of points.
[177:48.70]Everything's pretty... I can probably start pretty immediately.
[177:50.84]I'm going to wait.
[177:51.28]Should I just save for five grand?
[177:59.19]Is this free hot dog?
[178:00.83]No.
[178:13.47]Lizzy Nation.
[178:14.45]Okay.
[178:23.43]Ticket machine is probably more... Yeah, I'll get... Whatever I can do.
[178:25.91]Let's see.
[178:38.78]Good on hot dogs for now.
[178:49.22]I want that third star.
[178:56.24]Here we go.
[178:56.58]Let's make this quick.
[179:06.62]Which one of these chairs was broken?
[179:08.15]They're all like 80%.
[179:23.33]Sleep so workers work.
[179:26.50]Oh.
[179:30.90]So that's how that works.
[179:31.96]Okay.
[179:35.88]So now he'll help me actually repair stuff.
[179:39.43]Good to know.
[179:41.17]Oh man, he really does help.
[179:42.29]Okay.
[179:48.18]Face reveal.
[179:49.10]I've got a bunch of pimples on my head right now.
[179:52.51]I don't want you to see anything.
[180:01.12]Perfectly clean.
[180:12.97]Is there a secret lounge chair that I don't see that is broken?
[180:17.12]Or did he just fix it?
[180:19.45]When I got that notification.
[180:42.05]I'm surprised you don't have three stars yet.
[180:45.16]I need the ticket machine, that's why.
[180:47.20]Which I'm going to get right now.
[180:52.96]Alright, perfect.
[180:56.89]I'm ready.
[180:58.33]Ticket machine, please.
[181:13.15]Where is it?
[181:25.89]Oh, okay.
[181:26.59]Park decorations level 2.
[181:27.75]Oh, hell yeah.
[181:33.26]Shit, I need one more point.
[181:41.83]More decorations?
[181:43.78]Ooh, yeah.
[181:45.72]Table.
[181:46.38]No.
[181:47.23]That's an umbrella.
[182:19.55]I wanted to look at it first before you built it.
[182:21.62]That does not look good.
[182:32.19]That's not good.
[182:32.99]I don't like it.
[182:45.38]Why didn't you do this one?
[183:04.64]They have to walk by the food.
[183:06.23]I think that makes sense to me.
[183:48.32]One more right here.
[183:49.04]It's so uneven.
[184:06.70]It's fine.
[184:07.26]It's just there temporarily.
[184:08.28]I still need access to the back of these, so...
[184:17.70]Moving that trash can, I don't like it.
[184:23.72]Will they use it if it's not directly next to them though?
[184:28.79]I fear they won't, but whatever.
[184:34.58]Look how nice that is!
[184:35.76]It looks nice.
[184:40.26]You idiot.
[184:56.66]Alright.
[184:57.14]Saving money.
[184:59.50]We'll just do it another day.
[185:01.23]And I'm going all in.
[185:08.44]I need one more.
[185:09.98]How far am I for a level up point?
[185:13.30]30 experience.
[185:14.27]Okay.
[185:16.65]Done.
[185:17.17]Easy.
[185:17.85]I'll get it right now.
[185:27.66]Fix the pink paint?
[185:30.04]I need to unlock pink.
[185:36.21]I'm gonna be up here today.
[185:41.12]What's your favorite movie that's set in Boston?
[185:43.24]Uh, that's easy, The Departed.
[185:51.65]Where'd he go?
[185:53.21]Oh my god, I pushed him down the stairs?
[186:02.84]Let's go.
[186:03.64]I need a ton of money.
[186:06.87]I need one more point.
[186:12.20]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[186:16.58]I'm only 500 pounds.
[186:17.89]Feed me more.
[186:22.29]I'm up to 700 pounds.
[186:23.61]Feed me more.
[186:25.86]I'm only 300 pounds.
[186:44.15]I quote that all the time and people think I'm insane.
[186:46.96]Do you show them the arcade machine or do you just do that and not say anything else?
[186:55.44]Because I feel like that you need to tell them about it.
[187:01.07]Oh shit, people are waiting for a lemonade.
[187:11.85]Oh, and I need hot dogs.
[187:15.77]Oh, no, I'm fine.
[187:17.65]Okay.
[187:18.60]Let's put that ticket machine thing in.
[187:22.68]Ticket machine.
[187:25.97]Sell 50 tickets.
[187:27.29]Alright.
[187:27.91]How do I put one in?
[187:34.94]Is it just here?
[187:40.48]It is just here.
[187:41.70]Nice.
[187:41.98]Okay, cool.
[187:42.83]Well, guys, there's a smaller line over there.
[187:44.81]The last time you did bit for that arcade game, I went on eBay and almost bought a heavily used unit for like $900.
[187:52.56]You know how many times I thought about buying one of those units?
[187:57.75]But every time I think about it, I go, first of all, where am I going to put it?
[188:02.40]That is a massive, massive piece of furniture to dedicate to Big Bertha.
[188:18.42]I feel like I would kind of need a huge space to do more than just Big Bertha.
[188:25.31]At some point you're talking about... You need a few different machines, right?
[188:28.77]You have to start... Do you start your collection with Big Bertha?
[188:33.40]I think that has to be... I don't know.
[188:37.64]I guess I would.
[188:40.29]It'd be that and, um... Wheel of In!
[188:45.16]Service to Wheel of In!
[188:48.52]Service to Weylamin!
[188:50.36]He snuck through!
[189:10.51]He's supposed to pay an extra five dollars to get to the mint chocolate chip park!
[189:28.92]Imagine somebody holding a bag of trash and doing this.
[189:34.01]Cheater!
[189:47.82]Uh oh, there's puke in the pool.
[189:48.80]I'm trying to think of some other interesting game cabinets.
[190:00.11]that I would want if I were to actually get some.
[190:03.16]I'm not going to.
[190:03.88]I really just don't.
[190:06.27]Who has room for any of that, really?
[190:13.32]What if I make an arcade that's just not the same like eight gun shooting peripheral games at every arcade?
[190:23.54]What if I had an arcade that was just a bunch of weird, interesting oddity machines?
[190:27.12]Get out of the fucking pool!
[190:28.65]I'm actually mad about this.
[190:45.47]No, George!
[190:48.18]Hold on, George.
[190:49.24]I'm coming.
[190:56.40]Get out of the fucking way!
[191:25.14]Dude, everybody over here is an idiot.
[191:28.31]This is where the idiots go to swim.
[191:30.83]They're only ever drowning in this pool.
[191:32.71]Why?
[191:33.03]No one's ever drowning.
[191:38.75]Why am I picking another one of these up?
[191:41.31]Oh, I'm so sorry.
[191:41.95]We're out of hot dogs today.
[191:54.08]Oh, hold on.
[191:58.55]Look, I'm telling you, they're going to be over here.
[192:14.49]I... Hold on.
[192:17.28]Don't step in it!
[192:18.30]There's a wet floor sign right next to you.
[192:25.79]Come on down to the water park.
[192:27.63]Oh my God.
[192:47.19]Okay, let me clean this up.
[192:48.05]This place is getting dangerous.
[192:59.49]Game seems very stressful.
[193:00.57]It's a fun stress.
[193:03.31]Move out of the way.
[193:05.90]Please.
[193:10.87]Look at all this junk everywhere.
[193:15.45]Just wait.
[193:15.75]Tomorrow I'm going to have a jukebox and everyone's going to have so much fun.
[193:36.46]Oh, hold on, gotta go back to the idiot pool.
[194:06.45]Oh, hold on.
[194:11.50]You're an idiot.
[194:14.33]Fucking God, I'm going to get out of here.
[194:18.08]Oh my God.
[194:46.32]This thing is disgusting.
[194:51.25]Oh my god, there's so much trash everywhere!
[194:53.80]This is a disaster!
[194:57.70]What's wrong with him?
[194:59.79]Why is he holding his eyes?
[195:00.75]He's stinking his own eyes up.
[195:02.47]He's like a fucking walking onion.
[195:26.28]Go use your credit card.
[195:27.33]Why they couldn't buy a ticket?
[195:29.27]Couldn't buy a ticket.
[195:29.91]I just put a ticket machine in.
[195:31.51]I thought I hit my head on the ceiling.
[196:09.01]Somebody push that girl off the diving board, please.
[196:12.72]Because I can't, I'm busy.
[196:40.65]How does a diving board get this dirty?
[196:42.94]I don't get it.
[196:56.36]I mean, this is just free XP.
[196:57.43]I'm actually glad when they do this.
[196:59.63]This works out pretty well.
[197:16.98]I don't know what I need.
[197:42.35]Ow!
[197:42.65]I just got cut on something!
[197:57.26]Yeah, they're dumping the trash in the pools.
[198:00.03]Not cool.
[198:06.62]Alright, that was kind of a shit day.
[198:10.88]New daily report.
[198:13.09]Alright.
[198:14.39]I have enough.
[198:14.85]I have 5,000.
[198:15.45]I have enough to make a jukebox.
[198:20.30]Am I throwing every dollar I have in the metaphorical trash?
[198:30.37]Yeah, what was with the slipping today?
[198:39.73]You're not helping at all.
[198:52.77]Okay.
[198:54.09]I need to sell some more tickets, but...
[198:58.91]Um, I want the jukebox.
[199:04.31]Where should I put it?
[199:05.74]Probably over in Chocolate Chip Island.
[199:16.83]Back here?
[199:17.29]Next to the pool?
[199:26.38]Right here.
[199:31.00]Should I make like a little dance area?
[199:33.91]Okay, this is gonna be the dance area.
[199:38.06]What is the front and what is the back?
[199:39.41]I can't even tell.
[200:06.83]Splash Zone!
[200:27.90]I have a question.
[200:29.07]Did all that do is just unlock me the ability to change songs?
[200:32.07]Does it do anything for the park guests?
[200:44.02]It's just a decoration.
[200:46.10]I guess it's a level 2 decoration.
[200:56.76]Can I get my money back?
[201:02.92]We'll see if they dance around it.
[201:06.39]Because I gotta make a little dance floor.
[201:07.53]I'm gonna make a chocolate dance floor.
[201:22.78]and make your way over to Chocolate Chip Groove Station.
[201:39.49]Gonna hurt.
[201:41.11]I know.
[202:01.77]I need a new day so that guy works.

[204:01.20]Hey, in two hours, can you do something really loud so I wake up in time to watch the football game?
[204:08.02]Here's the thing with that is I'm going to do that, but you will have already have fallen asleep and woken up after about 20 minutes annoyed at how loud I'm being.
[204:19.00]And you're going to turn me down going, I'll just wake up.
[204:21.21]I don't care.
[204:21.61]This guy's kind of annoying right now.
[204:24.45]And then you're going to blame me because you're not going to wake up.
[204:27.50]And then I'm going to do it and annoy everybody else that's here.
[204:29.68]And you're not going to even hear it.
[204:45.57]I'm gonna have seven points to work with.

[205:44.75]What are you on?
[205:46.29]What are you on about?
[205:57.29]I might get eight points, maybe.

[215:26.77]Oh, shit.
[215:28.73]What can I get you?
[215:32.15]Okay.
[215:33.98]I had a pretty good day so far, not that many falls.
[215:37.88]I just changed the color of the ground.

[215:55.60]Who keeps laughing over here?
[216:08.69]What is with these people?
[216:55.08]Oh, come on.

[217:08.78]Well, blasted.
[217:25.71]I'm so glad you don't run out of mustard.
[217:30.27]You know what's funny?
[217:30.81]I don't think I've ever ran out of mustard in my whole life.
[217:50.06]Hmm.
[217:50.60]Hmm.
[218:00.87]Who else is drowning?
[218:13.09]My ear is itchy.
[218:16.04]I took $60 from that person.
[218:25.51]Why would you steal it in front of me?
[218:36.09]Oh, he's drowning?
[218:44.80]There's so many puddles!
[219:01.67]I can't get up.
[219:04.69]How do I unstuck?
[219:08.84]How do I get out of here?
[219:15.11]No!
[219:18.50]Somebody help!
[219:25.79]Respawn.
[219:42.51]That was a collateral.
[219:51.52]I can't keep up with this much.
[219:53.49]I can't.
[219:56.39]How am I supposed to keep up with this?
[219:57.83]I might have to hire a cleaner instead of a repair person.
[220:03.56]Or what if I just took the tickets?
[220:06.79]I got a plan.
[220:09.09]If I take over as the ticket person...
[220:12.80]And I have a cleaner and a repair person.
[220:20.15]I need a janitor.
[220:21.44]Yeah, so badly.
[220:22.66]It's not even funny.
[220:28.47]Any cheaters I can get rid of right now?
[220:31.87]Look at all the wristbands.
[220:34.08]As they walk by.
[220:45.20]Okay.
[221:04.40]Oh, that's my employee.
[221:06.32]I'm sorry, Max.
[221:07.72]I'm sorry, but you're fired.
[221:12.31]I didn't see a wristband.
[221:13.67]He's fired.
[221:21.13]Okay, now I need a janitor.
[221:24.05]There's no janitors.
[221:36.74]Endurance.
[221:41.07]I think this one's good.
[221:47.97]Now I'm gonna be the ticket person.
[221:58.32]And I will only come out to sell hot dogs and save people from drowning.
[222:15.01]There we go.
[222:15.27]Repair person and a janitor.
[222:19.41]Perfect.
[222:24.54]Getting there.
[222:28.51]What did it say?
[222:29.29]I needed level 2 trash cans, so... How do I get there?
[222:41.73]Okay.
[222:42.01]Let me get rid of the old ones.
[222:58.11]There's chocolate in the strawberry.
[222:59.25]I'll get it.
[223:10.22]Okay, you do get the money back, so that's good.
[223:44.50]Did I think this was a thing to store the life preservers?
[223:46.90]What am I doing?
[223:58.77]Can I have some coffee?
[224:03.09]Turns out the jukebox is the worst purchase I've made.
[224:05.44]I could have done a modern pool.
[224:16.48]And a modern slide.
[224:18.28]I think I'm just going to sell it.
[224:23.75]I think that's the play.
[224:28.50]You have a game so hard that your mouse pad starts to actually come off of the place where you hold your hand.
[224:35.99]This thing is almost in my lap.
[224:41.22]Yeah, get rid of this thing.
[224:46.92]I've lost, like, 13 heart holes.
[224:56.59]It's two-third refund?
[224:59.28]Well, shit.
[225:00.40]Okay.
[225:09.01]What about the dance floor?
[225:10.27]Um, I can change that into, like, a funny little thing.
[225:22.14]I'm gonna take a quick break too.
[225:24.86]Get a snack.
[225:27.27]I'm getting to three stars today before I turn the stream off.
[225:31.17]That is a guarantee.
[225:43.93]I want at least one big fun slide and one giant modern pool before I leave.
[225:49.42]And you bet your ass I'm playing this again.
[226:14.25]Okay.
[226:16.75]He's actually doing a pretty good job.
[226:29.48]What happened here?
[227:12.72]Yeah, let's go!
[228:03.02]Alright, where's level 2 trash cans?
[228:04.58]There we go.

[230:00.93]Nah, I'll go in right now.
[230:03.92]Never mind.
[237:29.67]I'm back.
[237:32.61]I also have a pretty major announcement.
[237:38.54]Confirm with you today that Squeaks and I are going to be playing Turtles in Time next week.
[238:02.68]One of my favorite Super Nintendo games ever.
[238:06.24]And one of my favorite games of all time.
[238:10.01]And we have to beat the whole game.
[238:12.71]Or Squeaks is gonna eat a hot pepper.
[238:27.03]Yeah, Squeaks has to eat a jalapeño.
[238:39.28]Alright, let's go.
[238:45.10]No, make him eat a ghost pepper.
[238:50.81]Dude, me and Squeaks play Turtles in Time, but we eat a ghost pepper before we start and we have to beat it while we're all fucked up on ghost pepper fumes!
[239:06.87]No.
[239:10.95]Okay, let me buy some hot dogs.
[239:17.80]Hey, don't stop streaming.
[239:27.75]I need you so I can sleep.
[239:31.51]Dude, I've got probably like three thousand VODs.
[239:36.76]There's four or five thousand VODs.
[239:43.18]You could watch a VOD over the course of a day or two and you would be able to watch like 10 years straight worth of content.
[239:56.76]No, it needs to be new.
[239:57.96]I've already watched them all.
[240:10.00]I know!
[240:35.56]Make a jermaTV channel and raid VODs, restream VODs and raid it.
[240:42.01]Nah, I don't really want to do that either.
[240:48.56]The VODs are there.
[240:51.00]I've thought about playing some games that I've already done years ago.
[240:57.35]You know, like, we just kind of do the same jokes, play the same games.
[241:01.93]I mean, I'll tell you, I'm going to play Beautiful Joe one day here.
[241:07.12]And I'm actually gonna play it.
[241:10.16]One day.
[241:10.44]Okay.
[241:20.64]Empty trash bins and we're good.
[241:23.16]Build fence?
[241:24.08]Oh.
[241:27.71]I got a lot of money.
[241:29.77]I got a lot of points.
[241:32.07]Well, do I want to hold them before three stars?
[241:34.14]Let's see.
[241:34.46]What can I do?
[241:35.56]Modern pools.
[241:38.58]Boom.
[241:39.88]Basic vending machine.
[241:41.62]Lifeguard.
[241:44.36]Super duper attractions.
[241:52.67]Maintenance decorations.
[241:54.68]Sludge hammer.
[241:55.64]I don't care.
[242:01.22]What is this?
[242:03.97]Jump board?
[242:04.69]Okay.
[242:10.27]Twin Splash Pool.
[242:18.94]I think we've replaced this.
[242:22.95]This has got to go.
[242:25.51]See you later, pool.
[242:28.18]It was nice knowing you.
[242:30.34]Am I getting rid of this one?
[242:45.70]How much longer are you going to stream for?
[242:47.97]I will stream probably for at least the next 10 minutes.
[242:53.56]Ooh, that's when we don't ever move the fridge.
[242:57.63]Okay.
[243:27.79]Perfect!
[243:31.32]Now, we go like this and we go to pool.
[243:37.01]I'm putting this pool in here.
[243:39.85]Oh, it's so much bigger.
[243:40.93]Shit.
[243:48.93]Okay.
[243:50.31]Oh, I'm gonna have to move a lot of stuff.
[243:55.18]It's too big!
[244:24.51]This dude's wasted.
[244:25.69]I did get actually pretty drunk on that Haunted House stream, whatever I did.
[244:44.76]When I was doing that grandma game, it was like, I'm... It's going, it's getting there.
[244:54.46]Okay, trash is good.
[244:55.61]I have to move all this stuff out of the way still.
[244:59.57]The pool is huge.
[245:28.75]Fuck out of my way.
[245:29.91]I thought this was a Jacuzzi.
[245:49.54]Move this.
[246:01.61]I'm not satisfied with it at all.
[246:05.52]But it's gonna go here.
[246:06.42]And put the chairs over on the right.
[246:35.17]Cute!
[246:48.65]Zero to this shit diving board.
[246:50.63]Time for a new one.
[247:08.13]Did he be right in the middle?
[247:23.75]I don't need a lifeguard.
[247:24.61]I'm fine.
[247:25.79]Okay, that's a new pool.
[247:27.22]Looks cool.
[247:28.36]Slide's got to move over here again.
[247:29.64]This is an old trash can.
[247:35.47]Delete that.
[247:41.24]Okay, that looks better.
[247:42.82]I'll delete this.
[247:51.29]Look at that!
[247:53.31]So much better!
[247:59.30]This pool is- Whoa!
[248:00.44]Look at how sick this pool is!
[248:01.70]Did I move it?
[248:08.33]Holy shit, that thing is cool.
[248:18.77]Looks good.
[248:20.65]Just have to make it the right color.
[248:38.42]I could do another.
[248:39.00]I'm gonna do another big pool over there.
[248:40.00]We're gonna get rid of the big square pool and put a new modern square pool in.
[248:50.63]Alright, we doing... What was it?
[248:52.45]Pink and brown or pink and white?
[249:01.40]Brown?
[249:02.60]Probably brown and white.
[249:13.06]Yep.
[249:18.93]Oh, look at how chocolatey that looks.
[249:41.88]This thing's made out of chocolate.
[249:43.17]If you bite into it, you can take a piece off.
[249:51.87]I think this is pretty great.
[249:54.25]I don't care what the haters say.
[250:05.51]Alright, I gotta destroy these and then... I wanna change the pool.
[250:09.85]Let me see the pool over here.
[250:29.04]Okay.
[250:32.17]I don't mind that.
[250:33.61]What are the other ones I can do?
[250:34.53]I could do a corner pool.
[250:39.40]That'd be cool over here.
[250:41.14]Like this.
[250:45.73]Like that.
[250:48.23]Or like this and put a little dining area right next to this.
[250:55.26]We could do a big slice.
[250:56.82]Like a big cake.
[251:00.31]Alright, let's get rid of it.
[251:16.80]Alright, where are things going here?
[251:18.10]I kind of like this here.
[251:41.42]I'll do a small one here.
[251:42.44]This is like the slide pool.
[252:22.02]This guy pisses me off.
[252:23.28]What?
[252:23.60]What?
[252:27.36]What's up?
[252:28.56]Come on.
[252:29.26]What?
[252:32.96]I'm playing a pool game.
[252:34.30]What's wrong?
[252:34.88]What happened?
[253:16.63]Well, whatever.
[253:17.39]It's fine.
[253:44.16]Much nicer.
[253:53.28]That backslide is going to have injuries?
[253:56.99]Is it?
[253:57.99]Shit, it is.
[253:58.73]Okay, hold on.
[254:09.76]There we go.
[254:19.42]This guy's an incredible water park manager and chocolatier.
[254:22.76]Thank you.
[254:26.21]Uh, I need paint.
[254:37.10]Okay.
[254:37.36]Pool needs to be, this is the mint chocolate chip area.
[254:41.75]So obviously I can stay on that theme.
[254:52.87]That's interesting.
[255:05.70]Was it better with the brown?
[255:16.60]No.
[255:35.83]Very cool.
[255:38.82]Can you change the song?
[255:39.80]I can't.
[255:43.79]Wait, this is your... Oh, hold on.
[256:17.04]plus this wouldn't even be here they're already black so it's fine
[256:43.80]I think strawberry white.
[256:46.38]Maybe I'll do one of each.
[257:13.84]I wish I could paint the dumpster.
[258:02.51]Oops.
[258:03.27]Hey, I didn't do that.
[258:10.42]How are you still only two stars?
[258:12.16]I'm working on it.
[258:18.07]Make the stairs chocolate.
[258:22.25]Dude, how about I hit you with this?
[258:52.76]But should the floor be Neapolitan already?
[258:55.24]I feel like this is you going down and you're going into Neapolitan, okay.
[259:00.75]So what... What do I even do for the outside?
[259:03.13]What do I even do?
[259:03.82]I need more colors before I even think about this.
[259:12.75]Yeah, I... I need more colors.
[259:14.35]Big time.
[259:24.42]He's probably white.
[259:30.69]Yeah.

[260:46.17]Okay, did I infiltrate everybody's brain?
[260:48.17]And are you guys going to get a Neapolitan carton of... Okay, a Neapolitan ice cream carton.
[260:54.21]It's going to be out of stock in your grocery store now because of apparently the extraordinary power that I have for like a thousand of you to buy it across the entire world, which is like 0.00002% of the stock that exists.
[261:24.65]Alright, I could go really, really wild with this, but I'm not going to.
[261:26.99]Wait, I can paint this.
[261:33.86]Cool.

[267:48.73]I have to just put it somewhere.
[267:51.31]I don't care.
[267:51.99]I'll move it later.
[267:56.08]That person's cheating.
[268:11.68]Okay, snacks.
[268:12.64]I need to restock it.
[268:37.61]Buy vending machine snacks.
[268:41.32]The lack of staff is appalling.
[268:43.72]Do I need to put an exclamation point?
[268:45.69]I can't do it.
[268:50.55]Where do I buy snacks?
[268:53.26]Granola?
[269:01.49]Good.
[269:02.09]Okay.
[269:04.15]Good.
[269:11.57]Perfect.
[269:11.93]Okay, good.
[269:13.15]Anybody want to buy a ticket?
[269:14.89]Yep.
[269:15.11]Where are our slide paths?
[269:34.39]Yes.
[269:40.10]Where's the janitor?
[269:43.09]I'll do it.
[269:45.07]Whatever.
[269:49.82]Look at all this stuff stinks.
[269:51.02]Where's the janitor?
[269:59.75]Dude, it's fixed.
[270:02.05]What are you doing?
[270:06.15]Get out of there.
[270:24.79]Oh, I thought you were trash.
[270:28.87]That guy just stole out of the vending machine.
[270:34.04]Oh, he didn't.
[270:34.72]Whoops.
[270:52.23]Excuse me.
[271:01.59]It's 20 bucks every time they use that.
[271:04.39]That's actually awesome.
[271:05.32]I should just make those.
[271:06.26]I should have no hot dogs.
[271:08.58]Get rid of all this shit and just do granola bars.
[271:22.96]Yeah, yeah.
[271:38.62]So many people want a lemonade right now.
[271:43.10]Get out of here.
[271:54.95]Okay, we're good.
[271:55.67]How's it looking over here?
[272:05.16]Slides could use some help.
[272:19.67]Sorry, I said, has the janitor done anything?
[272:23.24]Is he just stuck somewhere?
[272:35.03]Where is the janitor?
[272:41.94]You're not the janitor.
[272:45.03]Dude, he's mopping up the water!
[272:47.72]Go do something else!
[272:48.82]You don't have to mop the water!
[272:50.10]It'll drain.
[273:04.87]Alright, four thousand.
[273:05.67]This is a lot of money now.
[273:10.78]Six hours, teens, slide pass.
[273:12.14]Yep.
[273:24.07]You already all want one.
[273:25.31]Why would I even have any of these?
[273:30.47]Watching your hot dog server 360 hookshot a radioactive green garbage bag into the trash before giving you your food.
[273:40.74]I mean, that'd be funny.
[273:41.50]I wouldn't eat it, but I would say, dude, that was hilarious.
[273:47.09]Go wash your hands and then come back and I'll buy the hot dog.
[274:00.13]I need to restock this.
[274:10.20]Multiple people drowning in this pool.
[274:11.97]This became the idiot pool.
[274:16.75]I can't look at that right now.
[274:39.60]Oh, he had a wristband!
[274:40.70]Oops.
[274:55.46]You did not have a wristband.
[274:58.24]Wait, his wristband might be covered by his clothes?
[275:04.37]Okay, whatever.
[275:06.03]Good.
[275:06.83]This thing is amazing.
[275:14.77]Honestly, not a whole lot of trash.
[275:15.79]That's good.
[275:21.55]I think the janitor is... I think that actually works out pretty well.
[275:24.48]I would love to have somebody take tickets, too.
[275:28.16]What does it take?
[275:28.66]Do I have to be level 3 for that?
[275:34.41]I do.
[275:36.73]I need more vending machines.
[275:39.65]Let's do two vending machines.
[275:43.13]And I need to find a good place to put these.
[275:45.24]Where am I putting these?
[275:46.74]Ugh.

[278:33.50]That'd be great if I could.
[278:34.26]You can paint the other ones, I'm sure you can.
[278:56.69]Beautiful!
[279:02.41]Get new stock.
[279:05.14]Sleep, get new stock.
[279:11.67]I'll get those later.
[279:17.34]Hot dogs, lemons, granola.
[279:42.54]Good.
[279:45.36]Slipped on your own mess.
[279:53.42]I gotta be getting close to three, right?
[279:55.34]How have I not hit three?
[279:59.14]Better showers.
[280:03.35]I think we have to replace all the lounges.
[280:07.10]And I'm just gonna do this.
[280:09.36]Can I spray graffiti on stuff now?
[280:15.50]What does that mean?
[280:16.12]I have to finish the mission?
[280:22.27]I'm getting there.
[280:22.75]I think I'm ready to go.

[280:29.66]Alright, modern shower.

[281:23.15]It's a process.
[281:51.94]It can be not even it's fine.
[281:55.21]It needs to work.
[282:06.51]We're definitely good on showers now for a long, long, long time.
[282:24.91]I want to see what they look like.
[282:29.50]We have to paint them too.
[282:33.02]Not so easy.
[282:41.38]Actually, it's kind of cool.
[282:42.06]You can jump on them like that.
[282:43.58]Ooh, these are nice.
[282:52.48]5,000 showers but no staff.
[282:55.15]Exclamation point, I can't do that.
[283:12.96]Switch those colors up like this.
[283:24.63]Very cool.
[283:25.35]Nice.
[283:25.75]Alright.

[283:55.21]These are already dirty.
[284:05.12]Let's do one pass with the broom, throw the trash away and then get to level three.
[284:57.56]Do they despawn, though?
[284:59.51]I hope not.
[285:03.52]We're never going to round now.
[285:05.62]Alright, I'm going.
[285:06.48]It's time to go.
[285:07.10]I'm happy.
[285:10.29]Shit's ready to rock and roll.

[286:00.24]It actually does the... But it's only the first part.

[286:26.99]Get out!

[300:28.34]This might be too big for just a single ice cream flavor.
[300:41.41]Can I refurbish this slide, or is this just saying, hey, this is what could go here?
[300:45.31]Yeah, okay.
[300:47.57]This is just what if.
[300:55.54]Could do sherbert.
[300:57.97]That'd be kind of awesome.
[300:58.85]Sherbert is a lot.
[300:59.45]Sherbert is orange, pink, green.
[301:04.75]What else is in orange, pink, green, blue?
[301:09.24]It's usually orange, pink, green.
[301:21.22]I definitely wanted to get more slides.
[301:22.65]I'm prioritizing that after level 3.
[301:26.41]Is huge slides.
[301:55.53]Okay, I really don't want to destroy the palm trees, but I might need to.
[302:00.57]I could try to work around them, we'll see.
[302:21.60]Creamsicle's probably the best flavor.
[302:25.94]There are so many great ice cream flavors.
[302:27.76]Can you even really do a tier list?
[302:33.12]I've done it before, but... I don't think you can.
[302:51.86]Alright, almost done.
[302:53.82]With this.
[303:00.79]Okay, let me sit up.
[303:23.85]Look at all this room.
[303:24.77]There's so many cool things I could do.
[303:26.26]I could just do a line of pools.
[303:28.88]This one's gotta go.
[303:29.64]I'm sorry.
[303:33.69]I guess I could move them, right?
[303:38.16]Oh, I can't move them.
[303:43.14]Alright, let's get to level 3.
[303:44.82]I'm not going to do anything here now.
[303:47.45]Because I have to be level 3 to do any of this anyway, so no one's going to come over here anyways.
[303:50.41]I gotta get to level 3.
[303:55.44]I need... I can just put loungers over here.
[303:59.90]Alright, this will just be the who cares, I want to get away from it all and just lay down.
[304:03.98]I feel like I need to put like a stage up there.
[304:33.09]Parents lounge ya.
[304:42.20]The last thing to do is get rid of the perverts.
[304:45.20]And... Should be good to go.
[304:53.27]Okay.
[304:53.69]Puddles will happen naturally over the course of the day.
[304:56.72]Okay.
[305:00.64]I'm holding the points.
[305:04.73]I also am going to fire somebody.
[305:09.90]Because I want the puddles to myself.
[305:18.81]Who's the most efficient?
[305:22.47]It's fine.
[305:22.99]Okay.
[305:26.14]Alright.
[305:26.32]Start the day.
[305:27.32]Because I don't want to fire.
[305:28.32]The ticket shit.
[305:28.94]I'm not doing it.
[305:31.22]Oh, nothing to do with it.
[305:37.01]All I'm doing today is I'm looking for perverts.
[305:41.08]And cleaning.
[306:02.90]Here, take this.
[306:11.51]I'm gonna get a bird's eye of the park here.
[306:14.81]Just scan for perverts.
[306:26.12]Mm-hmm.
[306:45.76]Herbert.
[306:51.27]Already.
[307:03.23]You just got here.
[307:04.05]How did you jump in the pool and immediately started running?
[307:23.14]Oh shit, I have to serve people.
[307:47.01]I'm waiting.
[307:52.66]Hey!
[308:16.87]What the hell was that?
[308:21.06]Alright, almost there.
[308:21.94]Come on.
[308:23.96]So close.
[308:36.87]Pervert.
[309:14.85]Hmm?
[309:17.10]Ah!
[309:22.35]One more pervert and I'm good.
[309:43.47]I heard a camera.
[309:45.30]Who did it?
[310:01.95]Okay, one more pervert and I'm level three and I can finally research.
[310:09.40]Pervert!
[310:12.06]Hooray!
[310:22.27]I at the end of the day I will work on that.
[310:26.35]OK, cool.
[310:30.40]Is drowning.
[310:36.26]I like the double slide, it's cool.
[310:47.65]I could do the flyers right now.
[310:48.76]Mm hmm.
[310:57.61]Alright, nobody drown.
[311:04.58]Is it bad that I... I don't care.
[311:25.16]I'm coming.
[311:28.23]Somebody else is drowning now.
[311:32.03]I thought you were being a weirdo.
[311:38.80]Right in the face.
[311:40.54]Alright, clean the pool.
[311:51.72]Thank you.
[311:56.11]Don't run around the pool.
[311:57.07]I can run.
[311:58.16]I own the place.
[312:00.48]I have ripped rubber shoes.
[312:02.95]I have special shoes to be able to do it.
[312:09.38]Everybody else, no, they should not.
[312:11.08]You're right.
[312:30.32]Did I say somebody was drowning?
[312:35.61]Who's drowning?
[312:42.89]What is this?
[312:43.45]Somebody puked?
[313:08.96]Hey, I'm making the Vivaldi YouTube short vegetable soup you recommended.
[313:12.31]It's awesome.
[313:12.77]You're gonna love it.
[313:15.41]It's so great.
[313:27.33]Screwed up an order for a visitor.
[313:28.77]Did it say he was rested and back to work?
[313:33.94]Where was he before?
[313:34.60]Was he taking a break or something?
[313:48.77]Look at how many I have so many points right now.
[313:52.15]I'm gonna be able to.
[313:52.59]I gotta take a real long look.
[313:56.84]At the so much going on.
[314:14.71]Here don't puke on the slide.
[314:29.99]How's this for service?
[314:30.80]I was right here waiting for you.
[314:41.22]There you go.
[314:42.64]More?
[314:43.16]Oh my god, so many people are hungry.
[314:59.44]Too many people want- I can't leave!
[315:01.26]I actually can't turn- I can't do anything else with this.
[315:11.75]I can't wait to get another employee.
[315:13.91]Gonna be glorious.
[315:14.62]I was gonna say, I love that somebody's just taking a shower behind me while I'm serving hot dogs.
[315:30.69]Nobody wants this?
[315:31.76]Come on.
[315:32.42]You want it.
[315:47.27]Getting overwhelmed by the amount of people here.
[315:49.75]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[316:00.49]There's no more.
[316:01.94]Somebody's dying.
[316:15.55]This place is a fucking filthy piece of shit.
[316:26.43]I hear pictures, but I don't know who's doing it.
[316:33.86]There you go.
[316:40.56]Big J's swimming hole?
[316:42.53]Uh, it's Big J's splash zone.
[316:49.86]I swear I just emptied this already.
[316:58.71]Oh no!
[316:58.85]What do I do?
[316:59.75]I need to... I gotta bring him back to life.
[317:03.13]Where's the life injector?
[317:10.25]Alright, he's fine.
[317:25.45]I just emptied this trash.
[317:27.63]Why is it so full already?
[317:29.37]Alright, everybody get out of here.
[317:39.60]What a mess.
[317:51.65]Alright, new day.
[318:05.25]Okay.
[318:10.06]We got an entire new tree.
[318:13.67]Bender training level one.
[318:15.97]More paint colors.
[318:16.79]That's awesome.
[318:17.73]I want it and I kind of need it.
[318:25.69]No.
[318:31.12]Modern slides.
[318:38.09]Water gun upgrade.
[318:41.30]And then resort slides.
[318:46.30]I have no money.
[318:52.45]Fuck, I forgot staff!
[318:54.85]What do I have to do?
[318:55.76]Can I have a refund?
[319:06.20]Hiring level three.
[319:07.31]Yes, I can do it.
[319:15.58]Alright.
[319:16.72]What is this lifeguard?
[319:17.72]So I need a janitor, a ticket person.
[319:24.31]Okay.
[319:24.63]Who do I want to hire?
[319:28.50]It's fine.
[319:29.42]You're good.
[319:30.86]Now I have everybody doing everything.
[319:36.26]Very nice.
[319:36.90]So, what slides do I have now?
[319:41.97]I probably have some crazy ones.
[319:48.02]Inflatable slide.
[319:49.76]Ferved inflatable.
[319:51.52]Ooh, look at that one.
[319:54.43]Look at these.
[319:56.19]These are going to go nuts.
[319:57.35]I can't wait.
[320:02.44]Alright.
[320:04.00]I'm going to call it here.
[320:06.41]But we just unlocked all the cool shit.
[320:14.46]This game's fun.
[320:15.08]I like this game a lot.
[320:19.79]The next thing we'll do, we will... We're going to have to do another day to make some money.
[320:26.05]Or maybe I could sell a couple things here.
[320:29.56]How much does it cost?
[320:30.48]$2,000 for a crazy one?
[320:34.26]I could sell a pool.
[320:37.13]And then just have a huge awesome slide go into a dog shit pool.
[320:42.08]You know what I'm saying?
[320:44.76]So I could have a bunch of crazy slides just go into cheap shit pools.
[320:56.43]Let me try that.
[321:01.93]Just out of curiosity.
[321:04.00]If I had like two... Okay.
[321:06.14]If I had a dog shit pool here.
[321:07.52]And then if I sold this one.
[321:11.64]Is that enough?
[321:19.05]These things are not... These things are pretty cheap.
[321:21.88]No.
[321:22.74]Ain't gonna work.
[321:29.31]I'll build it for now.
[321:35.65]Okay.
[321:37.69]Alright.
[321:38.91]I will not be live tomorrow.
[321:40.33]What's today?
[321:40.79]Let's see when I'm going to be live again.
[321:43.16]You will see me on Monday.
[321:57.25]Monday we'll do this.
[321:58.88]Maybe something else too on Monday.
[322:00.92]But at least this.
[322:04.47]And then after Monday, I think Squeaks and I are going to do something.
[322:07.52]We're going to play Turtles in Time.
[322:10.60]Maybe like on Tuesday or Wednesday.
[322:18.49]I know it's going to be before Thursday.
[322:22.82]So I will see you guys on Monday.
[322:24.14]We will continue this.
[322:30.87]I love this game.
[322:31.49]It's fun.
[322:32.51]It's just busy work and it's fun to do.
[322:35.79]I can't wait to do my arc though.
[322:37.47]I'm going to do six shit pools and then six huge slides.
[322:42.86]And they're all going to be Sherbert themed.
[322:51.37]But I'll see you guys in a few days.
[322:54.15]I do have the outro screen, but I do not have the credits.
[322:59.14]But appreciate it nonetheless.
[323:02.66]Make sure I save this game.
[323:03.90]Good.
[323:07.85]And I'll see you later.
[323:15.43]At least I have the music.
[323:21.22]See you later.
[323:34.84]I just realized I don't have the end screen.
[323:48.44]I gotta add that.
[323:53.67]So this is your end screen for now.
[323:57.27]Okay, goodbye.
