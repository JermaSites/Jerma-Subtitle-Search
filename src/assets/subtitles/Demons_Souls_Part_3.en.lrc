[ve:60.16.100]

[00:38.79]Okay, so I might have a little bit of explaining to do.
[00:43.33]I might have some things to say.
[00:46.48]First of all, I want to say very, very much, wholeheartedly, I'm s- I'm s- I can't say it.
[00:57.00]Why?
[00:58.86]I'm very s- I can't do it.
[01:02.32]It's like liar, liar.
[01:03.36]I can't apologize.
[01:07.71]Oh, well.
[01:09.54]Anyways, uh, hi guys.
[01:10.26]Uh, if you're wondering where I've been the last few days, I've had some birthdays.
[01:15.94]Family birthdays.
[01:18.10]And, like, my birthday is coming up.
[01:20.78]So, the next, like, this past, like, seven days into this, into this current seven days, it's gonna be a little weird with streams, because I got something going on tomorrow as well.
[01:30.62]So, a lot of fucking family birthdays.
[01:32.60]A lot of my birthdays.
[01:35.14]And on top of that, I have not been feeling that great.
[01:37.40]So... I've been trying to fit streams in where I can the last week or so.
[01:41.80]And I do... I am very much so that thing, you know?
[01:50.51]57th birthday.
[01:51.37]What?
[01:54.95]And don't worry, I got a doctor's appointment coming up.
[01:57.89]This next week.
[01:59.17]We're gonna find out.
[01:59.85]We're gonna get to the bottom of my situations.
[02:01.99]You know what I'm saying?
[02:05.52]Thank you, Pin, for the $1.
[02:06.94]Yes, I am going to TwitchCon.
[02:09.36]If you are going to TwitchCon, you probably will see me there.
[02:14.58]At some point.
[02:16.24]TwitchCon is a lot smaller than PAX, right?
[02:20.06]Anytime somebody says, hey, you going to PAX?
[02:21.36]Maybe I'll see you at PAX.
[02:22.10]I'm like, yeah, maybe I will.
[02:23.46]And I forget that there's like 50 fucking thousand people that go to PAX.
[02:28.25]Only like 10 to 15,000 people go to TwitchCon, I think.
[02:32.39]So you probably will end up seeing me.
[02:33.77]I'm going to be one of like the 15,000 people there.
[02:37.13]That's easier than a Where's Waldo book.
[02:40.55]But Where's Waldo has, what, in that whole book, every single page, there's probably like 6,000 people on each Where's Waldo puzzle.
[02:51.30]And you find Waldo every time.
[02:53.97]He might be dressed like some random dickhead elf.
[02:57.68]But, you know, he's still got the same weird candy cane clothes.
[02:59.92]And I'm not going to be like that.
[03:00.74]I'm going to be in regular clothes.
[03:04.28]But, I mean, the point still stands.
[03:05.54]There's more people in a Where's Waldo book than at TwitchCon.
[03:09.35]So you'll find me.
[03:10.43]It'll be easy.
[03:13.05]Anyways, we're going to play more Demon's Souls.
[03:16.83]Still into it.
[03:17.47]I still care about it.
[03:21.34]Did I see the new Satan face emote?
[03:23.13]No, I didn't.
[03:26.63]Why do people rage quit so much in Tekken?
[03:30.99]I don't know.
[03:33.30]I have no idea.
[03:34.18]I don't think I've ever played one game of Tekken in my life.
[03:38.74]Maybe like Tekken 2.
[03:41.90]Yeah, I think I've played Tekken 2 like four times.
[03:48.56]What part of the game am I at?
[03:49.68]I just beat the armored spider.
[03:52.77]Second boss, I'm just on the way to who knows where.
[03:56.71]I'm as lost as you could be.
[03:59.37]Alright, let's let me make a tweet and just get situated and we'll get started.
[04:04.22]Give me one second.
[04:51.83]Alright, let me grab a drink.
[04:53.53]Sorry guys, I'll be right back in like two minutes.
[04:55.99]Forgot a drink.
[04:57.35]Be right back.
[06:08.38]Alright, let's get going.
[06:11.08]Time to continue our trek through.
[06:13.16]What happened to me last time?
[06:17.43]I don't even remember.
[06:17.99]I was in a jail and I fell down a well.
[06:19.59]I fell down a hole.
[06:21.35]Right?
[06:21.65]Something like that.
[06:22.19]Let's move over here.
[06:26.33]To the tin machine.
[06:29.07]There he is.
[06:30.01]He's beautiful, isn't he?
[06:34.31]He's beautiful, folks.
[06:40.27]You sang in harmony with that lady?
[06:42.33]Oh yeah, I did.
[06:47.05]I died 31 times.
[06:50.85]Robo Gandalf, thanks for the $5.08.
[06:53.01]How do I cheer?
[06:53.77]I think you just figured it out.
[06:56.63]I think you figured it out.
[07:00.92]It's your birthday tomorrow, Ashbringer?
[07:02.72]Sing me a song.
[07:04.10]Twitch chat, sing a song.
[07:07.00]I expect a full-on, like, actual rendition of a musical number from you guys.
[07:11.36]Otherwise, the stream is ending.
[07:16.28]You guys have to get a full entire song.
[07:23.44]You guys actually kinda did it.
[07:26.76]You sang beautifully, then fell down a hole.
[07:28.52]Okay.
[07:28.92]Well, I'm gonna head back there, because I did open a bunch of doors.
[07:33.87]Do I think I have any... No, I don't have any, like, stuff.
[07:38.24]Might have to go back to the... You know.
[07:43.24]That fucking level that I like to play on so much.
[07:45.72]Are you guys really doing, like, the Somebody Once Told Me The World Was Gonna Roll Me song?
[07:54.71]I really hope you're not doing that.
[07:56.11]Actually, how many of those do I have?
[07:58.89]You know, I guess... Eh, I'm not gonna use that yet.
[08:03.04]So you guys aren't doing that, are you?
[08:08.12]Somebody once told me the world was going to roll me.
[08:14.12]You want to know something interesting about that song?
[08:17.09]That song has stayed... This is remarkable.
[08:20.97]Historians are going to look back on this.
[08:23.43]That song has stayed in meme status for like 17 years.
[08:29.23]That's fucking remarkable.
[08:32.52]Like Shrek and somebody once told me have been in meme status since Shrek came out.
[08:40.62]They've never died.
[08:43.99]That's a history lesson.
[08:50.15]I'm gonna fight this guy.
[08:51.41]Do the little blue move.
[08:57.09]No, it takes one hit with the club.
[08:58.75]Get out of town.
[08:59.35]I'm gonna fucking 100% this area in 32 seconds.
[09:06.36]How does it go?
[09:06.72]How does that, like, funny meme song go?
[09:12.55]I thought I was gonna, like, actually kill him.
[09:14.31]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[09:15.65]Easy, buddy.
[09:18.57]It goes... Somebody once told me the world was gonna roll me.
[09:23.60]I got a fucking shed.
[09:25.78]She was looking fucking dumb.
[09:27.64]With a finger in the thumb.
[09:30.32]She's got a forehead.
[09:33.49]The world stops coming and they won't stop coming.
[09:36.72]Bend to the rules.
[09:39.00]Shit that ground running.
[09:39.92]Make that sense.
[09:42.78]Feel for fun.
[09:44.22]Your brain gets dumb, but your brain gets none.
[09:48.66]There's so much to do!
[09:56.51]Get in the back seat!
[10:06.08]Right?
[10:08.96]Something like that.
[10:09.56]I don't even need the block.
[10:14.46]Fuck the fucking shield, you know what I'm saying, dude?
[10:19.36]Oh, I'm fat rolling.
[10:20.86]Hey, don't you guys know what I was just singing?
[10:23.99]Get your brain, get dumb, buddy.
[10:27.67]Yeah, I probably should just reload the area then.
[10:33.65]I need to go buy this guy.
[10:39.03]Um, this was very dangerous the last time I was here.
[10:42.55]I really don't want to do this right now.
[10:44.87]But you know what?
[10:46.31]Fucking get your brain get dumb.
[10:47.41]Like, what's over here?
[10:57.98]As long as I play this as a relaxed man, it shouldn't go that self.
[11:03.04]I can go down.
[11:03.84]That's where I went before.
[11:04.60]What about in here?
[11:06.46]I remember this.
[11:07.04]This is where the manta rays, like, attack you with their fucking long-range missiles.
[11:12.83]And I did not want to lock onto that guy.
[11:14.59]Thank you for your asking, though.
[11:17.13]Thank you for asking.
[11:18.15]I wanted to lock onto you.
[11:19.07]Thank you for asking.
[11:23.48]Oh, okay.
[11:24.16]Well, there's you.
[11:29.04]Oh, boy, this fat roll.
[11:30.20]Oh, this is what we call a fucking disaster, guys.
[11:32.34]You know?
[11:39.61]What the fuck?
[11:40.89]What is going on right now?
[11:42.09]Why can I not fucking move?
[11:43.86]Am I really that fat?
[11:45.68]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[11:46.98]Like, why was I just standing there?
[11:49.30]Oh my fucking god.
[11:51.40]Why couldn't I fucking move?
[11:56.05]What?
[11:58.85]That wasn't even a fat roll.
[11:59.95]That was like my guy went, and just planted his feet.
[12:03.31]What the fuck was that?
[12:09.18]Honest to fucking god, get this fucking shield out of here.
[12:12.94]Doesn't even matter.
[12:13.83]Why am I wearing it?
[12:15.07]Take this whole fucking dumb uniform off.
[12:17.91]Give me a goddamn break.
[12:19.85]That's what happened last time.
[12:24.65]Seriously.
[12:27.60]The last time I played this game, I forgot I equipped the heaviest fucking armor I found so far, and I shouldn't even have this on.
[12:36.06]Holy shit.
[12:41.77]Why am I doing that?
[12:44.81]Oh, I forgot.
[12:45.45]Sorry, guys.
[12:46.55]I forgot.
[12:46.93]It's a Dark Souls game.
[12:48.15]So when you press up and R1 at the same time, you do a stupid fucking move that no one ever uses.
[12:52.72]And they put them in every game.
[12:56.64]Did you want to swing at somebody?
[12:58.68]No.
[12:58.84]You pressed up and R1 at the same time.
[13:02.12]So you do a move that no one has ever used to ever fucking do anything in any of the video games they've ever made.
[13:09.08]Okay.
[13:09.96]Good.
[13:17.69]Kick is legit.
[13:19.03]Yeah, maybe in like PvP.
[13:20.55]Can I like turn off PvP mode?
[13:24.65]Oh my god.
[13:28.57]I'm so fucking overweight.
[13:35.99]It's a guard break.
[13:40.23]Fucking moves dumb.
[13:42.48]What am I at for uh...
[13:46.75]Equipped burden 27 out of 47.
[13:48.41]You tell me I'm still fat rolling?
[13:49.61]Give me a break.
[13:57.40]Fuck that then.
[13:58.08]This thing weighs way too much.
[13:59.78]What does that put me in if I do this?
[14:06.40]Okay, there we go.
[14:07.32]I just can't wear the torso.
[14:21.65]Alrighty God And we really like but we really back at this stage where I fucking have to do this stupid shit for like an hour in ten minutes Just give me enough soul so I can get back to what I was doing Wait for this guy
[14:50.23]that sticky white stuff on.
[14:51.47]That's going to be bad news for me.
[15:00.91]Oh, shit.
[15:01.49]I forgot.
[15:01.89]You come down too, don't you?
[15:05.94]He's not dead.
[15:11.34]My lord.
[15:17.40]Okay, okay, okay, okay.
[15:20.56]Alright, bye.
[15:22.86]I want to get that, too.
[15:24.44]There's things I need to get, but there's... No.
[15:26.36]Just go buy some shit.
[15:30.02]Oh, he's got a shield on.
[15:31.12]What a terrible player.
[15:32.24]You know, I understand the need for, like, the forward in R1.
[15:40.98]But does it have to be forward in R1?
[15:42.66]I feel like I'm hitting forward and hitting R1, like, all the fucking time.
[15:45.68]Especially in, like, fights.
[15:46.86]When you're in a fight...
[15:48.86]I don't know why it's ever been mapped that way.
[15:50.68]It should be something else.
[15:56.20]I've always had a problem with that.
[15:59.19]In every one of these fucking Souls games.
[16:02.43]When in doubt, radish it out!
[16:04.33]That's what I say.
[16:22.36]Let's buy... Let's buy a bunch of that stuff.
[16:28.40]Let's buy 11.
[16:31.42]Sure, why not?
[16:34.82]I need to figure it out.
[16:36.00]I gotta get a shirt out of here.
[16:42.68]This club just weighs too much.
[16:47.88]Okay, where's... Just give me the black leather.
[16:52.96]Putting away this extremely heavy thing.
[16:57.70]That's 11.5.
[16:58.98]That's more than 10.
[16:59.64]That's fine.
[17:06.42]You have a heart of gold.
[17:08.78]Yeah, I do eat radishes on stream because they're extremely nutritious.
[17:16.17]And I'm fat rolling again.
[17:19.05]How heavy is this big shield?
[17:21.58]How many status points is that?
[17:22.88]You know what I'm saying?
[17:29.10]Not that much.
[17:29.98]24 to 18.
[17:32.03]7 points.
[17:35.13]Still fat rolling.
[17:36.17]I could just take the other shield.
[17:39.11]The kite shield.
[17:41.23]How much is that one?
[17:42.03]Yeah, that's better.
[17:47.71]Get this other thing out of here.
[17:50.83]Uh, what is it?
[17:52.63]I'm gonna unequip it first.
[17:54.43]Get out of here, sir.
[17:57.26]Thank you.
[17:59.52]Alright, that should do it.
[18:07.72]Until I get more endurance, I can't wear any of that shit.
[18:10.52]I just can't.
[18:15.12]This thing is so strange looking.
[18:16.38]This looks like a Halloween costume.
[18:19.44]Alright, let's go back to the jail.
[18:21.44]See if I can figure out what the hell I was doing in that jail.
[18:24.54]What was it called?
[18:25.10]The Stormy Meadows?
[18:28.89]No, it wasn't.
[18:29.51]Where was it?
[18:30.19]Over here?
[18:31.41]Stone Fang Keep, right?
[18:36.25]Uh, that's not Stone Fang Keep.
[18:41.10]Wait a minute.
[18:43.58]What the hell was it?
[18:44.20]Where was that?
[18:46.02]It was here, okay.
[18:50.99]Remember, what do I do if my dad leaves and never comes back?
[18:53.77]You gotta put a squirrel tracking device on him.
[18:56.39]Throw it on his back.
[18:59.67]And then you can find out, like, where he is.
[19:01.33]You can call him up and be like, Dad, I know where you are.
[19:04.71]And he's gonna be like, you do?
[19:08.05]Well, where am I, son?
[19:09.03]I'll be like, Dad.
[19:12.33]Yeah, no, this could get, like, dark.
[19:13.43]Never mind.
[19:20.44]Where are my YouTube videos?
[19:23.21]Um... You mean, like, where can you find them?
[19:26.01]Or, like, where are they?
[19:26.99]Like, how come you haven't been making them?
[19:31.59]Alright, well, uh, the first answer is YouTube.com slash Germany985 with a J. And the other reason is I watched my latest video on Germany985, and you'll find out why.
[19:44.17]So, should I just go through here?
[19:46.84]This is like where I was going, right?
[19:48.30]The first floor?
[19:48.82]Something like that?
[19:51.30]I don't know.
[19:53.82]These things are already open.
[19:54.88]Hopefully I'm going the right way.
[19:57.63]There was a thing with a guy with a gigantic anime explosion device thing.
[20:02.39]And here comes a dude.
[20:10.73]I'm eating radishes.
[20:12.99]Highly recommend them.
[20:15.32]If you've never had a radish before...
[20:18.41]Go get them and eat them.
[20:19.73]But be careful on your stomach, though, because they can be pretty harsh.
[20:25.89]Just watch your tummy.
[20:28.01]They're not, like, tummy-ready, if that makes any sense.
[20:37.48]Mm-hmm.
[20:41.66]So, this is not openable right now.
[20:44.02]Did I get the key for it?
[20:44.86]No, I didn't.
[20:45.24]Yeah, I got the key for this.
[20:50.24]A lot of shit in here.
[20:53.76]Unknown hero soul.
[20:56.87]Oh, I forgot.
[20:57.55]I forgot those hold people.
[21:03.93]Claws.
[21:07.10]Alright, nice.
[21:08.40]Claws.
[21:09.68]Probably a dex weapon.
[21:12.60]Secret dagger.
[21:16.84]I mean, is that... Is that a literal secret dagger?
[21:19.72]Or is... What does that mean?
[21:20.76]Like, it's a secret dagger.
[21:27.57]Secret dagger.
[21:28.01]A half-bladed dagger in wide use among the king's spies.
[21:31.83]Slashing weapon inflicts heavy damage on soft flesh, but has limited effect on metal armor and hard scales.
[21:36.49]Okay.
[21:38.79]Of course, it's for parrying.
[21:40.99]And this thing is... Got D scaling.
[21:46.28]De-scaling for Dex.
[21:47.70]Oh, two Dex weapons.
[21:52.02]What else is new?
[21:53.46]Welcome to Dark Souls.
[21:54.58]It's not Dark Souls.
[21:56.02]Why am I saying that?
[22:01.22]Do a parry build?
[22:02.40]No.
[22:04.98]I can barely wipe my own ass.
[22:06.28]You think I'm going to be able to do a parry build?
[22:09.33]Like, I have trouble wiping my ass.
[22:11.91]And you guys want me to parry everybody.
[22:20.73]Wait.
[22:24.95]Wait.
[22:25.45]Did I just hurt myself?
[22:28.45]What the fuck was that?
[22:31.26]Kill him.
[22:31.76]Kill him.
[22:32.68]Get up.
[22:33.30]Get away.
[22:35.78]What does this guy have?
[22:36.38]An electric fence?
[22:44.99]Do it.
[22:46.23]Is he walking away?
[22:47.91]Use the secret technique on him.
[22:51.14]Nope, not yet.
[22:51.71]I'm gonna wait until he turns around again.
[23:04.92]Wipe your ass left-handed?
[23:06.04]Now that's a challenge.
[23:12.71]Secret technique gets him every time.
[23:18.98]So, I'm kind of walking around aimlessly, right?
[23:22.66]No.
[23:26.28]I know, I have to get back to where that fucking ballista is.
[23:35.83]Quick, wipe his ass.
[23:38.49]My mother had to wipe my ass until I was like in the ninth grade.
[23:43.37]Ever tell that?
[23:43.81]Do you guys know that?
[23:45.89]I used to be afraid of the toilet.
[23:47.27]My mother had to wipe my ass into like 11th grade.
[23:52.91]Sorry, it's not true.
[23:56.29]Where do you guys get these little shanks?
[24:10.23]Old story.
[24:15.75]Well, come on, somebody drop some heals.
[24:20.78]Yeah, but my mother, I'm not even kidding, my mother did have to wipe my ass until I was like very, very old.
[24:25.90]At least like into like the fucking fourth grade.
[24:28.40]I almost just died right there.
[24:33.28]I got lucky.
[24:35.00]It's not like this is gonna drop off, isn't it?
[24:36.44]Isn't there a hole here?
[24:37.12]I remember this.
[24:42.24]Keep moving.
[24:45.17]Okay, remember this.
[24:49.67]What was it about the toilet that made me so scared?
[24:51.21]It was the noise.
[24:53.43]The toilet makes a gigantic, awful sound when you press the button.
[24:59.12]Right down here.
[24:59.70]When was the last time you guys flushed a toilet?
[25:07.24]It's crazy.
[25:09.59]It's like... It's terrifying to like a fucking 14-year-old, you know?
[25:18.09]Okay, is this where I need to go?
[25:24.54]I don't think so.
[25:32.00]Does your mom have to come over every time I go to the bathroom so she can wipe my head?
[25:36.02]Imagine that.
[25:36.58]She had to like come get me.
[25:43.25]Hello?
[25:44.09]Hey Ma.
[25:45.96]I went to the bathroom.
[25:47.56]Can you come over here?
[25:50.08]You know how much trouble I have.
[26:05.16]That was a very delayed scared reaction to this.
[26:09.62]You gonna stop?
[26:13.00]Stop!
[26:19.92]What?
[26:21.16]What the fuck?
[26:26.10]You just instantly die if you go near it?
[26:29.62]Why?
[26:30.06]You instantly die.
[26:34.80]Oh my god.
[26:36.20]I fucking fought that thing and killed it before.
[26:39.96]I didn't... Oh my god.
[26:47.06]What the hell, man?
[26:48.26]You just, you don't even get a shot.
[26:49.76]You just, you die.
[26:51.14]You just die.
[26:51.66]You walk up to it and your body stops functioning.
[26:53.68]Your heart stops.
[26:59.87]Like, just let me run.
[27:00.93]Like, please.
[27:02.33]I gotta go back down there and, like, get my body and not, like, walk into the gumball under the fucking desk gumball.
[27:12.86]Get out of the fucking way.
[27:14.04]I ain't even messing around.
[27:19.89]You, like, spitball enemy.
[27:29.46]That was so dumb.
[27:37.42]Just go.
[27:37.90]There's a guy across the way.
[27:38.94]He shoots at you.
[27:39.64]Just run by him.
[27:45.10]Mad streamer slaughters entire prison.
[27:48.74]Well, what was that?
[27:49.56]Like, you're not even gonna give me a chance?
[27:54.82]At least I know how to get here now.
[27:58.20]Yeah, you can ding-a-ling all you want.
[28:00.16]That's fine.
[28:00.60]Yeah, that's fine.
[28:01.20]You can play around with your ding-a-ling all you want.
[28:04.31]Not gonna phase me.
[28:09.55]How long have I been streaming for?
[28:11.67]Since 2011.
[28:15.33]Or 2012.
[28:17.09]Something like that.
[28:18.51]Can I go down even further?
[28:23.41]And if you mean tonight, like 20 minutes.
[28:27.80]I've had a Twitch TV account for like six years or something.
[28:33.14]Okay.
[28:33.84]Let's not have that happen again, please.
[28:38.10]Where is it?
[28:42.64]I'm not going to let that happen again.
[28:44.14]I've already killed that thing and picked up the stupid... You know what I'm trying to say.
[28:54.58]I forgot about that guy.
[28:56.90]It's all good.
[28:58.43]Remember, and then there's, you turn around here, you walk this way, you walk by that guy, and there is the, there's the giant anime device.
[29:07.41]That's all I can say.
[29:08.21]That's what it looks like.
[29:08.85]I feel like it would be on, like, Van Helsing.
[29:11.52]Like, just the episode, Helsing.
[29:15.30]Guy does something weird.
[29:16.62]You know what I'm talking about?
[29:18.42]You know what I'm saying?
[29:19.08]When a guy does something weird on that show, Helsing, that anime.
[29:28.70]Nope.
[29:30.06]Do not fuck around.
[29:30.99]Just go by him.
[29:32.69]There's no reason to do that.
[29:33.91]Here we go.
[29:38.05]It's right out here.
[29:40.97]Here it is, right?
[29:42.59]Okay, there it is.
[29:43.25]Where is he?
[29:43.79]Down there?
[29:45.25]Where's that big thing?
[29:46.03]There was a big thing that I should be scared of, and I don't know where it is.
[29:49.35]There it is.
[29:57.34]I can walk out here.
[29:58.04]Should I walk out here?
[30:02.78]Oh, baby.
[30:03.30]Hold on.
[30:06.69]Oh.
[30:08.93]Don't mind if I do.
[30:11.29]Oh.
[30:11.41]He doesn't do anything, right?
[30:17.67]He doesn't aim at me, does he?
[30:18.65]That thing can't move.
[30:20.03]I hope it can.
[30:22.07]It's got like 900 arrows in there.
[30:25.19]Is it moving?
[30:27.45]No.
[30:28.51]It's just stuck in the mud.
[30:29.47]That's fine.
[30:33.51]Mercury.
[30:34.15]Ooh!
[30:38.85]It's a dex weapon.
[30:44.12]What's with all these dex weapons?
[30:45.46]How come there are no strength weapons in this game?
[30:47.66]Why did I pick strength?
[30:49.18]I'm going to be angry about that in like an hour and ten minutes again.
[30:56.48]Can I not get back up?
[31:01.42]Uh... Wow.
[31:03.76]Okay.
[31:04.62]What the fuck?
[31:05.50]I just... That's not... That's new.
[31:08.83]That's new.
[31:09.35]Hold on.
[31:09.71]Wait.
[31:09.87]You can walk up this?
[31:12.83]That's pretty new.
[31:13.75]Can I do that over here?
[31:21.16]I never experienced anything like that in a Dark Souls game.
[31:25.39]Okay, I, I, I, okay.
[31:30.67]Is there a way to get by here?
[31:34.77]It's not new, it's in the first game.
[31:40.84]How the fuck do I get over this?
[31:43.70]I must be able to get around here, right?
[31:45.68]Is there enough ledge for me to walk around this?
[31:52.27]That don't look like enough ledge.
[31:56.55]I don't know.
[31:57.81]I don't believe so, guys.
[32:01.66]I can't vault over this.
[32:06.18]Not even a chance.
[32:06.86]No, I'm not going to do that.
[32:07.70]Are you kidding me?
[32:10.88]That is just... Please kill me.
[32:13.98]Can I get up there?
[32:20.06]Interesting.
[32:20.56]All right.
[32:22.40]Do the same thing on small wrong.
[32:26.86]So I have to let go and deal with this machine.
[32:29.17]Alright, let's be fucking safe about this.
[32:38.45]Okay, it goes one, two.
[32:40.77]One, two.
[32:44.21]Wow, it's so frame rated because there's so many arrows.
[32:46.52]Let's go.
[32:47.98]Okay, I just got a key.
[32:53.40]Should I run by?
[32:54.02]Okay.
[33:01.54]Oh, shit.
[33:02.24]This ends.
[33:03.46]Wait, I can go down there.
[33:13.09]Stone... That's not worth it.
[33:16.07]Nothing else here?
[33:16.65]I can vault over this, right?
[33:17.71]Like, just like in those other Dark Souls games that I never remember.
[33:20.58]I'm gonna fucking run off the edge.
[33:21.84]Because you can't vault up.
[33:28.54]Guys, come on.
[33:29.32]Give me a break.
[33:29.86]That's scary shit.
[33:34.15]No, like, invisible walls here?
[33:35.51]Don't fuck around, man.
[33:36.67]Alright, well, I have a key now.
[33:42.26]What is this key open?
[33:42.96]Those doors that are back here?
[33:45.20]Hmm, maybe.
[33:47.00]I might have found myself a little bit of an entryway back here.
[33:49.69]There are a couple of locked doors that I couldn't go in.
[33:53.83]Why don't I try it?
[34:00.32]Where is the locked door?
[34:04.94]Locked door.
[34:05.72]Wasn't there one all the way up here?
[34:06.84]There it is.
[34:10.16]Oh!
[34:12.71]That's unfortunate.
[34:17.82]That's unfortunate.
[34:21.62]Oh, hey, look, our new hotel room.
[34:24.56]We already did that.
[34:25.40]We can't do that anymore.
[34:30.40]We've made that joke like a hundred times in a different video game.
[34:36.57]Yikes.
[34:37.01]I believe it was back here.
[34:42.84]Don't fall off an edge.
[34:44.02]I did the same thing last time.
[34:46.07]I remember.
[34:47.11]It's over here somewhere.
[34:47.85]There's a hole.
[34:49.47]Yep, that's where I fell off last time.
[34:51.27]Not gonna happen this time.
[34:53.45]I'm gonna go around.
[34:57.71]This game is just like Dark Souls.
[35:01.45]If you don't know, this video game is the first ever game in the series.
[35:10.01]In the Souls series, this is Demon's Souls.
[35:13.84]By golly, is it tough.
[35:16.37]You know?
[35:18.53]Bite George.
[35:23.17]What's this?
[35:25.83]What's this?
[35:29.95]What's with the fucking portal?
[35:34.77]Oh, damn.
[35:35.23]Wait, hold on.
[35:38.79]Item for free.
[35:39.55]What is it?
[35:42.39]S-Stock.
[35:45.36]Come on.
[35:46.92]Throw me a bone here.
[35:49.16]What the fuck?
[35:52.56]That's everything.
[35:54.82]Everything's like a cool dex weapon.
[36:02.49]I don't want to run around with a heavy club the whole game.
[36:04.91]Like, ah, oh well.
[36:05.91]Might as well eat a radish.
[36:14.31]Well, I can go down here.
[36:17.05]The guard he got was down here, though.
[36:24.55]Go get the Falchion in 4-1.
[36:27.61]When I do 4-1, like, for real, I will.
[36:29.35]I need to finish... I need to finish 3-1.
[36:36.79]I just got a new key, and I don't even know where the hell it brings me.
[36:40.89]This whole world... This whole level has melted together as the same place.
[36:51.63]You know what I mean?
[36:55.72]You guys, like, bought gold online.
[36:58.38]Like, a bunch of different gold bars and a bunch of different, like, presidents on those bars and, like, all the different gold coins and, like, bullion coins and stuff, whatever.
[37:04.70]And they're all separate and they're all cool.
[37:07.52]And then you just melted them down and put them in the same pot.
[37:10.74]And you just made, like, a giant gold chunk.
[37:13.80]And that's what you're wearing around your neck right now.
[37:21.88]Yeah, bullion.
[37:23.68]Bullion!
[37:26.44]The fucking coins.
[37:27.32]Bullion coins.
[37:35.19]I know there's a place where I could open the door.
[37:37.41]It's over here.
[37:39.45]There was at least one or two doors up here.
[37:42.37]I don't know if it's these ones.
[37:50.56]Here we go.
[37:50.94]Come on.
[37:52.12]Like up here?
[37:53.91]No.
[37:55.67]Let me look at what it's called.
[38:01.81]It's that guy's door.
[38:03.05]Where the hell was that guy?
[38:06.74]There it is!
[38:07.60]I knew it was over here somewhere.
[38:09.78]I knew it was back here somewhere.
[38:11.44]There's another one though.
[38:12.10]Let me open the other one.
[38:17.73]Perfect.
[38:18.13]Okay.
[38:18.35]Let's go down here first.
[38:23.99]Let me take a look at some bits.
[38:24.97]Hold on a second.
[38:25.39]Let me take a look at some bits.
[38:27.73]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the bits.

[40:09.70]The last time I listened to music, I turned the radio on and, like, Kung Fu Fighting played.
[40:15.02]And I was singing along.

[41:11.37]Alright, okay.
[41:12.39]That's me, Tony Clifton.
[41:15.13]Anybody know who that is?
[41:15.83]I don't like how these guys run.
[41:19.49]They scare me.
[41:20.07]Are you still following me?
[41:24.96]Ow.
[41:29.84]Strangely enough, no healing has fucking dropped in this entire level so far.
[41:35.17]Get him with the secret.
[41:40.95]Let's knock it, Donnie Clifton.
[41:45.25]That's right.
[41:45.87]That's Andy Kaufman's alter ego.
[41:47.19]Somebody got it.
[41:47.69]Good job.
[41:49.54]You deserve a cookie.
[41:52.08]Somebody got it.
[41:52.58]Tony Clifton is Andy Kaufman's alter ego.
[41:54.60]You deserve a cookie.
[41:57.90]I hear somebody walking and it's scaring me and I don't like it.
[42:03.99]Turn around, we're gonna get this guy the secret.
[42:05.71]No we're not.
[42:07.91]I'm gonna fuckin' baseballs.
[42:08.91]No, here we go, secret.
[42:16.14]I did it!
[42:16.70]Stupid!
[42:17.32]Dash!
[42:18.22]Aw, wet!
[42:18.82]I hate it!
[42:19.38]I hate it, I wish I could just disable it.
[42:22.24]I wish I could just turn that move off.
[42:23.88]I wish I could turn this off!
[42:26.07]Forever?
[42:27.15]I never have to do it again.
[42:28.25]Cause I've never used it.
[42:30.63]I got the shortcut.
[42:33.43]Or something.
[42:42.42]What else we got?
[42:47.99]I ain't going in here until I know what's in here.
[42:54.90]There's a pogo stick enemy down here.
[42:57.22]Somebody's enjoying a pogo stick.
[43:06.31]Where's this fucking clown person?
[43:16.08]Is that it?
[43:18.46]So when is he going to dab?
[43:19.96]I'm not going to dab.
[43:24.34]Why?
[43:25.36]Look, why do you guys... Look, I don't know if... Okay, you might be like the younger generation.
[43:29.60]Let's be like an old fucking person here.
[43:33.00]It might just be me.
[43:34.12]It might just be the fact that I, you know, I'm a very, very elderly person.
[43:39.64]But, I mean, really here.
[43:41.96]What's going on?
[43:42.38]What's going on with, like, all this dumb shit that you guys think is cool?
[43:57.23]What, like, a generic fucking overstatement?
[44:03.29]Where did that even open up to?
[44:05.47]Where is this?
[44:09.71]You know what we used to do?
[44:11.67]Like, oh, you guys have, like, the dab?
[44:14.09]What the fuck is that?
[44:14.93]You remember the Macarena?
[44:17.45]The Macarena is what we used to do.
[44:19.55]And it was fucking cool.
[44:21.57]You know, you, like, put your hands out, like, and then, look.
[44:24.39]This is what we used to do when we were fucking kids.
[44:29.21]It was fucking cool.
[44:33.66]I gotta, like, I gotta fucking get ready for this.
[44:35.39]Hold on.
[44:37.09]This is important that you guys see what was fucking cool when I was younger.
[44:45.27]Hold on.
[44:45.61]Don't, like, die in the game.
[44:50.24]Uh, Macarena.
[44:50.94]There.

[47:29.06]Wait a minute.
[47:29.58]Can I turn it off?
[47:31.10]Is it facing me or is it facing the other way?
[47:34.30]I can, like, turn it off, right?
[47:35.60]Oh, no, no, which way is it facing?
[47:39.02]I don't know.
[47:39.44]There's, like, I'm not a fucking engineer.
[47:40.80]I'm not a mechanic.
[47:41.40]I don't know how to turn this off.
[47:43.04]How do I turn the machine off?
[47:47.35]Do I have to, like, whack it?
[47:51.33]Oh, pull the lever.
[47:57.17]There we go.
[47:57.77]Alright.
[47:58.33]We turned that thing off.
[47:59.17]That's not, like, a boss, is it?
[48:02.21]Okay.
[48:03.17]Now I'm safe to go over here and pick up all the items.
[48:06.15]Thank you, puzzle solved, Demon's Souls.
[48:08.65]Not even a hard game.
[48:13.57]Oh, yeah.
[48:14.53]Give me that delicious, clever rat ring.
[48:17.27]Alright, well, we have to put that on.
[48:21.05]And more down souls.
[48:22.95]This is perfect.
[48:26.92]Stone of Ephemeral Eyes.
[48:30.86]Alright.
[48:31.78]What's the rat ring do?
[48:35.38]What is that fucking rat ring?
[48:38.43]Cling ring?
[48:39.29]Okay.
[48:40.25]Attack power rises at 30% or lower HP.
[48:43.11]Because that's one of those rings.
[48:49.69]Um... Yeah.
[48:54.01]Grant us eyes.
[48:55.09]Grant us eyes.
[48:56.29]Grant us eyes.
[49:01.88]That's the dumbest character in the whole show.
[49:04.14]This is not a show!
[49:04.98]Alright, let's keep going forward.
[49:08.84]I'm gonna go up to the top.
[49:25.42]I feel like... I already got the escape pod, right?
[49:36.13]What's in here?
[49:38.79]I already got the escape pod, but I want to make sure that there's not another escape pod.
[49:42.18]Because I opened up that escape pod.
[49:44.72]This up here is probably the real escape pod.
[49:50.10]If I'm going to guess.
[49:50.76]This looks like a please open up the shortcut escape pod.
[49:55.47]Ooh, what is that?
[49:57.25]Oh, that's a dangerous item.
[50:02.81]That's a dangerous item.
[50:04.39]When we walk around corners, we fucking hold our hands up, you know?
[50:07.63]I ain't gonna die here.
[50:10.08]There it is.
[50:10.40]Is that some kind of... I believe that... I believe I just got it.
[50:22.38]Although I got... I'm very concerned.
[50:27.96]Weird shit over there.
[50:35.29]I ain't going anywhere without my fucking hands in the air.
[50:37.97]Silver catalyst.
[50:38.93]That's not... Damn it.
[50:45.79]There's a lot of magic weapons, too.
[50:52.29]Why does Jerma hate millennials?
[50:54.23]Who the fuck is that?
[50:59.10]I am a millennial.
[51:01.44]What do you mean?
[51:02.14]You think I hate myself?
[51:04.12]I am a millennial.
[51:08.76]I'm an older millennial, but I'm still a millennial.
[51:12.78]It's like 1834.
[51:13.70]I'm still in that category.
[51:22.23]A millennial baby.
[51:25.15]We grew up at the turn of the century, man.
[51:29.12]Did you see that comet?
[51:32.74]It was a comet that went through one time.
[51:34.44]Alright.
[51:36.62]You're telling me that there's no way for me to get over there?
[51:42.96]They wouldn't put this gigantic hallway here with a door.
[51:45.33]Am I missing something?
[51:46.89]I feel like I am.
[51:54.29]I guess not.
[51:58.59]Um...
[52:00.70]Okay.
[52:03.14]Well.
[52:04.51]I guess there's nothing else here.
[52:07.81]Unless there's a wall.
[52:09.45]Like an illusory wall.
[52:11.75]And the camera, you're not doing me any favors.
[52:21.32]Is there a wall that's back here somewhere?
[52:23.06]I don't want to come back here.
[52:29.58]Do you remember?
[52:29.90]You're so old, you've... Oh, I'm not going to read that one.
[52:33.45]Is there an illusory wall?
[52:35.17]There's no illusory wall.
[52:40.55]No.
[52:41.33]Okay.
[52:41.83]No.
[52:47.98]Illusory wall.
[52:50.76]No, there is not.
[52:51.36]Okay.
[52:51.62]Well, thank you.
[52:52.16]I appreciate that.
[52:54.92]I asked you guys specifically.
[52:58.61]I think there's another door if I go down.
[53:08.11]My nose is, like, bothering me.
[53:10.91]I need a new nose.
[53:12.30]How do you get another nose?
[53:14.00]Don't you guys wish that there was, like, a weekend Mr. Potato Head yourself?
[53:18.00]Just, like, rip out fucking noses and eyes and shit.
[53:21.72]Just, like, tear them out.
[53:22.58]Okay, there's another door over here.
[53:26.73]Let's go to, like, the nose store.
[53:27.85]Yeah, they'd be, like, fucking... Instead of, like, makeup stores and stuff, they'd be, like, nose stores.
[53:31.76]There's so much shit.
[53:38.26]Oh, I'm gonna get so lost.
[53:44.70]Did I already come down this one?
[53:47.63]I'm doing that thing again where Jeremy talks and forgets everything that he's doing.
[53:53.41]And even if he's backtracking, he'll forget and he'll go up the same fucking stairs.
[53:59.61]Yeah, I already did this.
[54:02.08]You fucking idiot.
[54:04.44]How dare you be that dumb.
[54:06.24]How dare you.
[54:12.06]I haven't been here.
[54:13.96]What?
[54:15.00]What, I didn't go here?
[54:18.87]That was a pretty sick Gears of War.
[54:21.99]Gears of War copied this fucking game.
[54:28.37]No sense of direction.
[54:29.27]Well, it's hard to have a sense of direction when this entire level is the same level.
[54:34.13]It is.
[54:36.47]This whole entire level is a series of... Wait a second.
[54:41.13]What is that?
[54:43.75]Okie dokie.
[54:44.84]We know that's there.
[54:45.64]Hold on.
[54:47.59]Oh, this is the other side.
[54:48.29]Okay.
[54:53.38]Help in.
[54:53.78]And there's a weird magician down here that I have to be careful of.
[54:56.04]I don't know what this guy is.
[55:00.14]This guy's either an NPC or he's a general enemy that I'm going to kill in one swing.
[55:07.35]I don't know.
[55:08.89]Uh...
[55:10.50]Talk.
[55:11.18]Okay, cool.
[55:12.22]Okay.
[55:12.42]Well, I can get the key.
[55:14.48]What is this thing here?
[55:16.58]You give me like a weird portal over here.
[55:18.86]Person of Hope, special key.
[55:42.39]Like, do I go into the golden beam?
[55:45.07]Like, this is gonna teleport me to a room in Half-Life 2.
[55:47.69]Yeah, this doesn't do anything.
[56:00.82]Alright, well, this guy's not an issue right now.
[56:06.50]He's a ghoul.
[56:07.19]He killed him.
[56:07.59]He's a ghoul.
[56:08.81]You know, you gotta give everybody a chance, okay?
[56:12.52]This guy deserves one chance.
[56:17.55]They're waiting for you, Gordon, in the test chamber.
[56:22.89]Oh, be careful, Gordon.
[56:24.67]Make sure you find your way down the hallway and... It's right on the left.
[56:30.32]Gordon!
[56:40.36]Kill him.
[56:40.78]Everyone say kill him.
[56:41.70]Kill him.
[56:42.34]Why do you want me to kill this guy so much?
[56:48.52]You want me to bury this guy?
[56:49.79]You want me to kill this guy?
[56:54.03]Kill it.
[56:54.45]No.
[56:54.99]This is the boss.
[56:55.95]This is the boss?
[56:56.77]Wait.
[56:56.91]If I kill this guy, I don't have to fight the boss.
[57:04.85]He's evil.
[57:05.57]Bury your mace in his head.
[57:07.37]Alright, I'm gonna baseball swing this guy.
[57:09.97]If this guy needed to live.
[57:18.80]What did I do?
[57:20.94]Was I not supposed to do that?
[57:23.64]It's done now.
[57:24.62]So now I can get your joke out.
[57:25.76]It's not so funny.
[57:27.74]Now you can't get the super item.
[57:35.17]God.
[57:36.67]It doesn't even have anything.
[57:40.75]I've ruined everything.
[57:41.71]I got baited.
[57:45.55]You fucking... Don't even tell me that.
[57:47.97]Don't tell me that I got baited and, like, that's not real.
[57:54.74]So let me go... Like, okay.
[57:56.88]Did I open up all the shit I need to open up?
[57:58.68]Like, door-wise?
[58:00.36]Should I grab this item or do I need to still pick up stuff?
[58:02.44]Like, open doors and get, like, shortcuts.
[58:06.16]Whatever, I'm going for it.
[58:08.20]Line this up.
[58:09.36]Just like a diving board.
[58:11.82]Hello?
[58:12.20]Hello?
[58:12.60]Hello?
[58:13.20]What's that noise?
[58:15.16]What is that noise?
[58:21.95]What is that noise?
[58:25.27]What is that fucking noise?
[58:34.89]Oh shit!
[58:35.61]Okay, I got it.
[58:38.48]Okay, wizard lotus.
[58:44.78]Someone's just eating cereal really loudly.
[58:48.21]Can I survive if I jump off here?
[58:51.57]I don't know if I'm going to live through this.
[58:57.30]Oh!
[58:58.82]Oh!
[59:17.43]I can't tell if the fall did damage to me, like, after the fact, or if that guy killed me with the cross.
[59:21.98]I don't know.
[59:23.36]Does anybody know what the fuck that was?
[59:27.98]Oh, man.
[59:28.56]Now I gotta find my way back.
[59:30.02]What the fuck?
[59:33.44]I opened up a door, though.
[59:34.52]Where's that door that I opened that makes it easier to get there?
[59:42.12]It was the crossbow.
[59:42.84]The crossbow just did like 75% of my damage.
[59:48.08]How was I supposed to know that guy was there?
[59:49.58]I heard like... Where's this door?
[59:55.38]I opened up a special door somewhere.
[59:56.94]I don't know where that door even is.
[60:07.83]God damn it.
[60:12.59]I mean, I can just go down.
[60:13.71]I did get another key, though.
[60:26.08]Maybe it's worth opening, like, a cell?
[60:27.90]Maybe I can open that guy.
[60:28.92]Where's that guy's cell?
[60:32.36]Is it over here somewhere?
[60:40.46]Where's that guy's cell?
[60:41.96]Oh, man.
[60:46.18]Hell in a cell.
[60:54.67]He's right behind me.
[60:59.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[61:04.23]Okay.
[61:06.51]None of you
[61:09.51]None of you have dropped anything.
[61:12.79]Why?
[61:19.02]What about you?
[61:19.64]You sell stuff.
[61:24.32]You have full moon grass.
[61:25.86]It's too expensive.
[61:26.80]I hear a guy.
[61:30.56]Can we expect a birthday stream?
[61:33.84]I am not going to be streaming on my birthday.
[61:35.76]Nope.
[61:36.46]I am not.
[61:41.82]I do have a lot of these.
[61:43.22]I might just buy a bunch of these.
[61:44.52]I still have these actual boss souls.
[61:51.05]I'm not sure what I want to do with them.
[61:56.83]Kill her.
[61:59.69]No, I'm not killing the Bioshock Infinite lady.
[62:07.83]Yeah, I'm not going for a Bioshock Infinite kill.
[62:11.21]Sorry, guys.
[62:13.07]Saw how that game ended.
[62:15.47]I just, I... Oh.
[62:17.43]Come on.
[62:19.39]We're okay.
[62:21.52]We're fine.
[62:22.38]There's just two of these fucking octopus boss people.
[62:26.48]Oh, man.
[62:27.52]Oh, man.
[62:40.37]Where is that fucking door?
[62:44.73]Ah, god damn it.
[62:47.89]Come on in here.
[62:49.17]Do it.
[62:50.55]One of- Two more steps.
[62:53.98]I will fucking bash your brain in when you walk over here.
[62:56.50]Here it comes.
[62:56.92]Alright, be easy.
[62:57.72]Not until you see the whites of his eyes!
[63:09.13]Ah!
[63:16.37]I haven't picked up any fucking healing.
[63:18.11]Why is there no healing in this entire level?
[63:21.23]Why?
[63:22.03]It doesn't make any sense.
[63:27.57]There's not one fucking moon grass.
[63:29.56]It's all spices.
[63:31.62]You can't bake a meal with just spices.
[63:33.88]You're just gonna put fucking like oregano in a pot?
[63:36.44]No, you need protein.
[63:37.42]You need fucking vegetables and shit.
[63:38.88]What the hell?
[63:39.62]Where is all the healing items?
[63:48.54]I don't know where he is.
[63:49.26]Is he gonna go back down?
[63:51.40]I have no fucking idea.
[63:52.72]It says the guy that eats turnips and radishes.
[64:00.45]Those aren't spices!
[64:01.45]I'm just gonna go down.
[64:05.09]Fuck it.
[64:08.98]I was in the... Wait, what do you mean I was in the room with him?
[64:12.20]No, I wasn't.
[64:13.98]Help him go to the bathroom.
[64:16.33]He's not on this level, is he?
[64:17.39]I thought he was like one down and one up.
[64:20.65]This whole level's a blur, so don't ask me.
[64:24.89]Where is he?
[64:32.07]He's not on here.
[64:36.81]Oh, fuck it.
[64:37.29]I don't even care.
[64:39.24]He's like up a level.
[64:43.87]I just wanna, like, go fight the boss.
[64:45.13]I've been here way too long.
[64:46.25]Alright, come on.
[64:55.80]Get outta here.
[64:58.14]Help him.
[64:59.36]He's up here, right?
[65:03.15]He's, like, all the way down the end of this hall.
[65:08.23]Right?
[65:10.11]Right?
[65:12.47]Or is he not?
[65:19.33]No, he ain't.
[65:19.87]I'm just walking around in fucking circles.
[65:27.41]This is where the lady is.
[65:29.85]Just get me back down to where I was, for Christ's sake.
[65:32.08]I'm fucking done with this shit.
[65:41.00]I'm just going down.
[65:42.04]I don't care.
[65:42.36]That guy can rot and fucking die in prison.
[65:44.48]Who cares?
[65:52.00]I only have one healing item anyways because for some reason they expect you to play through this whole area and not pick up one health Just like walking around in circles Please help me
[66:21.18]And I did it again.
[66:21.98]And I... Fucking god damn it, dude.
[66:30.14]Give me a fucking break.
[66:31.08]I hate this fucking place.
[66:34.41]It's just, it's just a circle.
[66:35.95]It's just fucking nine circles.
[66:37.85]And they're all the same.
[66:39.97]And sometimes they fucking drop you.
[66:41.77]Like, I'm just leaving.
[66:42.99]This is so dumb.
[66:45.46]Just go to the fucking bottom.
[66:47.34]In this stupid fucking circle maze where every fucking part of the level is the same level.
[66:52.72]Everything's identical.
[66:54.30]There's no difference.
[66:55.02]It's just nine circles.
[67:00.57]That's it.
[67:06.94]Where does it go down?
[67:07.90]I want to go down, not up.
[67:14.41]It's just a box.
[67:16.12]It's just like seven boxes on top of each other.
[67:18.76]And it's like, wait, which one?
[67:19.74]Third floor?
[67:20.18]Fourth floor?
[67:20.60]Fifth floor?
[67:21.32]Second floor?
[67:21.84]Ninth floor?
[67:22.26]Eighth floor?
[67:23.54]Which floor are you on?
[67:24.16]I don't know.
[67:24.52]Who cares?
[67:25.18]Fifth floor?
[67:25.70]Sixth floor?
[67:26.72]Ninth floor?
[67:27.02]They're all the fucking same.
[67:28.04]All of them are the same.
[67:29.26]There's no difference.
[67:30.92]That one has a little more dirt on the fucking edge.
[67:35.29]That one's a little more dirty.
[67:36.63]Oh, car.
[67:37.09]Good.
[67:37.77]Another rectangle.
[67:38.51]Good.
[67:39.09]Got it.
[67:49.15]Give me this fucking thing.
[67:51.66]Eat my ass game.
[68:12.31]Get the fuck out of here.
[68:14.67]Where's the correct rectangle?
[68:16.61]Where's the correct rectangle to go around?
[68:18.17]Get me out of here.
[68:30.26]At your pleasure.
[68:32.76]Alright, but I did open a door.
[68:35.90]Why am I getting an accent?
[68:38.32]I'm so flustered right now.
[68:39.38]I'm getting a fucking accent.
[68:43.35]The thing is, I don't know where those big double doors were.
[68:47.14]They could be fucking anywhere in my mind.
[68:56.29]Like, just, is it down here?
[68:59.51]Can't go that way.
[69:03.25]I'm fucking hitting this guy in the head, by the way.
[69:06.31]I'm so done with this guy.
[69:07.68]I'm baseball swinging this guy.
[69:09.24]I don't even care what it does.
[69:11.81]Oh, don't touch us like Anomaly!
[69:12.99]It's gonna get- you're gonna get shocked!
[69:14.11]I appreciate you $25, son.
[69:36.94]And I can make it back to the... I thank the stars that I have... Okay.
[69:43.14]I got a stiletto.
[69:43.76]I got another dex weapon.
[69:45.04]I have been empty, but I can still move my... Nice.
[69:48.87]Let's take a look at it.
[69:52.75]Cool.
[69:53.67]Like a cool dex, like, magic weapon.
[69:57.65]Have you seen my fucking giant club?
[70:01.58]I'm real strong, you know.
[70:09.11]I'm really strong.
[70:10.01]I can hold a big spiked club.
[70:13.92]This is the only item I have.
[70:17.18]You wanna see it?
[70:18.08]Just respec.
[70:36.63]Oh my god.
[70:37.79]Don't do it.
[70:39.15]Don't do this to me.
[70:42.40]I wish you guys would drop like half moon shit.
[70:44.66]It'd be really nice.
[70:45.56]I'm gonna fall to my death again.
[70:51.42]I really might.
[70:53.74]I really might do that.
[70:55.14]It's very possible.
[70:59.36]Okay.
[70:59.84]There's the door.
[71:02.89]Let me keep moving.
[71:06.38]Watch out for the guy, watch out for the red guy down here.
[71:10.02]Can't wait to fight him with one... Like, 8% heal.
[71:14.79]That's gonna be fucking fun.
[71:19.07]Nothing else I can open, right?
[71:20.23]Let me just open up the secret door so I can run from the bonfire.
[71:28.70]No, it's fine.
[71:32.54]It's fine.
[71:35.52]Is that... I can go up there.
[71:37.42]I think that's the boss.
[71:41.36]This is definitely the boss up here.
[71:48.60]It has to be, right?
[71:55.50]And this doesn't open.
[72:00.40]This is just the way to go to fight the boss.
[72:02.82]With one health.
[72:10.79]Just dupe the grass.
[72:13.72]You know, I really would, but you guys know how much... People are just going to be so like... What did you do?
[72:19.98]Let me look down one more thing before I inevitably go die at the lady that's here and then have to buy a bunch of grass.
[72:35.53]How am I so lost?
[72:37.35]I'm not currently lost.
[72:39.30]I know where to go.
[72:40.00]I just want to make sure I didn't miss anything.
[72:42.95]Like, I gotta go up here.
[72:43.75]I already did all this.
[72:50.73]There's nothing else here, right?
[72:52.55]This is the only way I can go.
[72:55.99]I gotta go visit my, like, marijuana dealer.
[72:57.89]Yeah, that's it.
[73:02.31]Nothing else.
[73:03.63]I just have to go this way.
[73:04.85]I'm just gonna... Whatever, right?
[73:06.53]Let's just do it.
[73:08.74]I know how to get here.
[73:09.38]I have enough to heal one time, so let's see if I can, like... Let's see if I can kill this boss without having to heal.
[73:19.65]Yeah, right.
[73:20.57]Not gonna happen.
[73:25.52]I did just make, like, a weed joke, I know.
[73:27.56]I'm better than that, I know.
[73:30.18]I know.
[73:32.30]Trust me, I know.
[73:32.84]You...
[73:37.53]What?
[73:38.55]Wait, wait a minute.
[73:39.55]Dude, like, wait a minute.
[73:41.67]This guy just fucking pops out of the smoke?
[73:44.41]What the fuck?
[73:45.48]Why did it not... Oh, you... Let me see the boss.
[73:55.54]I just want to see the boss.
[73:57.18]I want to see the boss.
[73:59.45]What is the boss?
[74:02.85]What the fuck?
[74:03.63]He just comes out of nowhere.
[74:05.31]Okay.
[74:11.40]I have no healing.
[74:13.48]Like, you know what?
[74:14.22]Fuck.
[74:15.14]That's the boss.
[74:15.66]I might as well just try to fight this guy.
[74:17.30]This, like, invisible man.
[74:18.34]Just fucking stunlock him.
[74:33.19]Caught the plague.
[74:34.27]Okay.
[74:35.03]And I got this... What...
[74:39.52]This is why, like, I'm gonna give you a Demon's Souls complaint, okay?
[74:44.32]When they brought this system back for Bloodborne, blood vials were fucking everywhere.
[74:52.12]They were fucking everywhere.
[74:54.80]To have an entire level where you don't pick up one is like, what?
[75:01.01]Why?
[75:01.41]It doesn't even make any sense.
[75:12.72]I can't, I will, I have to go get Moon Grass.
[75:24.71]Grass is everywhere in World 1.
[75:26.21]Well, but, like, I shouldn't have to go back to, like, fucking 1-1 Mario.
[75:43.25]You can buy vials from the messengers.
[75:44.77]That's another thing, too.
[75:46.39]I can buy... vials in Bloodborne.
[75:51.03]From the fucking random guy there.
[75:52.35]And they're cheap.
[75:58.39]Do one, two.
[75:59.67]What?
[76:04.35]I have a bunch of consumable souls, but that sucks!
[76:06.33]Like, having to use all my consumable souls to buy, like, green grass?
[76:10.31]Like, that's fucking terrible!
[76:12.47]That's so bad!
[76:16.98]They also learned how to improve their games.
[76:27.08]Double loading screen here, sorry guys.
[76:30.24]It's cuz I'm bad.
[76:32.63]No, it's because there's one item I have to collect from one to over and over again.
[76:37.64]That's it.
[76:44.92]Sounds like I need a shield.
[76:47.76]They should have fucking patched the goddamn game.
[76:49.64]Go back and like patch the game and make it like Bloodborne.
[76:52.02]The better game.
[76:56.44]What is this?
[76:57.48]The first fucking game you've ever made?
[77:02.10]No, it's not, guys.
[77:02.96]Sorry, they made like 19 armored cores before they made this game.
[77:06.10]They knew what the fuck they were doing.
[77:23.36]We're just pacing in the Nexus.
[77:31.11]Where are these green shits?
[77:37.09]I actually haven't even done anything past here.
[77:46.36]King's Field.
[77:48.86]Should I be going down this way to get stuff?
[77:50.88]I've never gone down here.
[77:52.26]Should I go backwards?
[77:57.42]I probably am ready to go through here, though.
[78:06.54]Yikes.
[78:07.88]No, no, no, no.
[78:08.64]Just take out the shield and just walk.
[78:10.44]Okay, there's a lot of you guys.
[78:17.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[78:18.89]I don't think these guys even drop anything worth touching.
[78:21.77]A throwing knife.
[78:33.54]Can't go that way.
[78:41.67]You know, I actually, I probably wouldn't be as, like, annoyed at this game's, like, healing system if there weren't, like, five different healing items.
[78:50.88]Just have it be, like, the 50% heal.
[78:52.04]For all of them.
[78:54.70]And don't have them drop all the time, but, like, have them, you know what I mean?
[78:57.18]Like, why do they have to have, like, six different grasses?
[78:59.82]Like, what?
[79:01.60]This one heals you, like, a tiny bit.
[79:03.14]This one heals you, like, a little bit more tiny.
[79:04.80]This one heals you big.
[79:05.68]This one heals you really big.
[79:06.78]This one heals you fully.
[79:09.40]Holy shit.
[79:11.43]That's a little messy.
[79:16.81]I don't think these guys drop any of these.
[79:21.54]I don't know why I'm killing them.
[79:35.54]I can't even imagine if Bloodborne had like five different vials.
[79:40.11]That would probably shit my pants.
[79:47.52]Wait, wait, a dragon comes.
[79:48.72]A dragon comes, right?
[79:49.50]A dragon comes!
[79:51.44]A dragon comes!
[79:52.76]I forgot!
[80:22.97]Okay.
[80:25.01]Well, at least I picked up the spear.
[80:26.38]That's an obvious dex weapon.
[80:29.52]Dex weapon number, like, fourteen.
[80:33.72]Strength weapon number two.
[80:39.22]Do I gotta bait it out?
[80:41.80]Or do I just run?
[80:46.92]I'm out of, yeah, that's right, I am out of radishes.
[80:48.74]Come on, breathe fire.
[80:52.91]I might have to bait it out or something.
[80:55.99]There he is.
[80:56.35]There you go.
[80:57.43]Come on.
[80:58.66]Get on over here and fly down and Dracarys this bridge, you dickhead.
[81:05.20]Make your way down here.
[81:06.68]And spew it all over the bridge.
[81:09.72]Where is he?
[81:10.46]There he is.
[81:11.18]Okay, goodbye!
[81:12.18]Okay, go!
[81:17.59]Go!
[81:21.17]Why did I pick that up?
[81:22.11]There was no reason to pick it up.
[81:24.86]My finger is slipping off of the controller, Dad!
[81:26.98]Okay, I'm fine.
[81:45.31]Oh, cool.
[81:45.73]Grass.
[81:46.31]Three grass.
[81:47.07]Three grass.
[81:47.77]Is he aiming in here?
[81:54.41]I'm not entirely sure, like, if I should be, like, here right now.
[82:06.02]Is he gonna keep doing that?
[82:08.04]Where does he do it?
[82:08.54]Does he do it, like, in front of me here?
[82:10.88]Is it on the bridge?
[82:11.62]Only on the bridge?
[82:15.46]Am I safe when I go up here?
[82:20.82]Hit him.
[82:22.56]I don't know if I'm safe here.
[82:27.50]These guys would be dead if I wasn't safe.
[82:29.47]I'm definitely safe.
[82:34.89]That's cool.
[82:36.11]Nice.
[82:39.93]Another fucking... I just want to backstab you.
[82:45.28]I got a good view of when he comes in every time.
[82:50.08]Can I... I'm gonna try something funky here.
[82:53.07]Can I like hit him in the fucking head when he comes by?
[82:56.41]Here we go.
[82:58.61]I don't think so.
[83:01.21]I don't think I can.
[83:10.05]Look at all this grass I'm getting.
[83:11.25]It's wonderful.
[83:16.71]He doesn't go up this far, right?
[83:23.71]Does he keep going?
[83:24.29]I don't know if he follows me.
[83:25.93]I don't know.
[83:26.43]I'm like fucking scared right now.
[83:27.71]Because I don't know if the dragon comes down here.
[83:30.73]Of course he does.
[83:32.86]Oh boy.
[83:35.42]Oh boy.
[83:36.04]Oh, it's just...
[83:43.36]I gotta wait for him to do that again.
[83:45.34]Come on.
[83:46.12]I'm using all the healing because I don't know this fucking zone, man.
[83:53.93]Come on.
[83:54.25]Do it again and I'll just run past it.
[83:57.23]Look at all the people that are up there.
[84:00.65]Do it.
[84:05.70]Where is he?
[84:06.06]Come on.
[84:09.72]Do it.
[84:11.32]Here he comes.
[84:23.30]This is not what I'm supposed to be doing.
[84:29.56]Go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back, go back.
[84:39.69]How do I go down?
[84:41.16]There it is.
[84:48.12]I got a new shield.
[84:50.06]I guess.
[84:57.45]I hear dogs.
[85:00.29]Using all the healing I just picked up.
[85:06.95]I need to know the right route.
[85:09.20]I don't know the right root.
[85:11.78]I hear all kinds of dogs.
[85:13.50]There's a whole kennel down here.
[85:16.74]Do you hear this shit?
[85:19.01]I don't know which way they're gonna come from.
[85:20.39]It's like 40 dogs down here.
[85:29.74]There he is.
[85:31.08]He's not gonna land in here, is he?
[85:32.44]I gotta go the other way so I can s- I wanna see what's up th- Hi, hi, hi, hi!
[85:37.65]Okay, one hit.
[85:38.25]Somebody behind me, I think!
[85:39.91]No.
[85:40.47]Calm down.
[85:40.83]You're gonna be fine.
[85:55.10]I want to go the other way.
[85:55.96]Of course I put the shield down.
[86:00.30]What the hell is going on in this room?
[86:23.67]Come here, please.
[86:28.47]What are you?
[86:28.81]Are you one of those typical guys who... No, this... Soldier Lotus.
[86:42.90]No, that's not what I want.
[86:44.85]Ring of Gash Resistance.
[86:46.13]It's a bleed ring.
[86:47.19]Okay.
[86:49.41]I don't like this.
[86:52.08]Oh, who is that?
[86:53.73]Wait.
[86:54.95]I think that's an NPC that I saw before, right?
[86:58.23]It is.
[86:59.23]Cool.
[87:00.55]This is part two of this guy's quest.
[87:03.76]Dark Moongrass.
[87:04.20]Only one?
[87:04.58]Can I open this?
[87:24.61]Backstab this guy.
[87:26.05]This is bad.
[87:27.73]Not a single person left.
[87:29.87]Just dupe that grass.
[87:33.38]Did he say, how could this shit happen?
[87:34.56]What did he say?
[87:35.26]He said, how could this shit happen?
[87:36.86]This is bad.
[87:37.38]How did all of this happen?
[87:42.10]Dupe it.
[87:42.58]Dupe that grass.
[87:43.64]Dupe it!
[87:46.63]That's the best available.
[87:48.39]Dupe it.
[87:48.85]Dupe it.
[87:50.43]Am I going to get banned on stream for duping?
[87:58.66]I want to go the other way.
[88:06.87]Is Blizzard going to ban me from Battle.net?
[88:10.55]The dogs are actually in here.
[88:12.87]Can I wait for him?
[88:15.51]Will he attack the dogs if the dogs come down the hall?
[88:18.07]Let's find out.
[88:18.71]Here he comes.
[88:19.11]Let's aggro these dogs.
[88:19.71]Fight them.
[88:28.48]I can hear them.
[88:29.14]Come on.
[88:30.14]Here we go.
[88:30.54]Fight.
[88:33.64]Fight that dog.
[88:35.86]Alright, fuck you too then.
[88:37.56]Give me a break.
[88:44.52]This is too scary.
[88:45.98]I don't... Where are these dogs?
[88:57.46]giving me, like, anxiety.
[89:01.12]Nothing there.
[89:01.60]Okay.
[89:05.18]Unknown soul.
[89:12.82]More grass.
[89:13.44]More grass for me to consume and not take back with me.
[89:18.02]So far, so good, right?
[89:20.30]Yeah, that...
[89:27.64]Oh, boy.
[89:28.56]There's too many.
[89:31.09]They're too big.
[89:31.57]It's like the whole Stark family.
[89:33.43]Get away from me.
[89:35.65]All right.
[89:35.91]Baseball swing.
[89:40.87]Oh.
[89:51.17]Jesus Christ.
[89:54.66]If I could take on one at a time, like, but they're huge!
[89:57.84]They're absolutely massive!
[90:01.77]I have to heal for this, otherwise I'm gonna die.
[90:03.67]Alright, come on, you, just you, come on.
[90:06.21]One at a time.
[90:07.85]Alright, let's fight like Shaggy Dog.
[90:13.49]Okay, you were the fucking runt of the litter.
[90:15.28]That's fine.
[90:17.10]Any of the smart ones gonna wanna come down here?
[90:40.00]I think.
[90:46.10]They're all stupid.
[90:47.12]They're all blind and deaf.
[90:49.40]Okay, we're good.
[90:49.98]We're fine.
[90:50.44]Everything's gonna be fine.
[90:52.08]We killed them all.
[90:54.04]They're all blind.
[90:59.42]I'll take a victory when I take a victory.
[91:02.10]A bunch of like blind deaf dogs.
[91:05.33]So why'd they come after me in the first place?
[91:09.07]There's another one down here.
[91:16.31]There's more than one down here.
[91:17.46]There's like three more dogs down here.
[91:26.58]That one was smart.
[91:29.52]That one had the collective brain power of all of his brothers and sisters.
[91:38.32]I'm going to have to fight that dragon, huh?
[91:40.20]At some point here.
[91:43.78]Almost to the end.
[91:47.24]Okay.
[91:49.28]Some more grass.
[91:56.44]On his knees.
[91:57.08]Is there anything over here?
[92:03.16]There is.
[92:03.56]Okay, there's a spot to go up.
[92:04.70]Let me take a look.
[92:08.10]This is definitely gonna bring me out to the other half of the bridge, right?
[92:12.97]Yeah, it is.
[92:13.81]Let me get these guys killed and then collect some items.
[92:20.87]Fog gate.
[92:23.95]Just come over here, please, and spray some fire over here, please.
[92:25.99]You're not gonna get them all?
[92:29.31]Get these guys.
[92:29.89]There's like five people here for you to get.
[92:32.73]Just spray them.
[92:36.78]It's right down here.
[92:37.46]Why is he stopping?
[92:44.61]Like, I want to kill this guy.
[92:48.41]He's just pulling up immediately.
[92:55.21]Okay.
[92:55.95]Well, whatever.
[92:56.61]There's an item down there, though.
[93:04.35]Am I safe inside, like behind that?
[93:06.57]Let me see.
[93:09.34]He stops right in front of us.
[93:11.46]Is he gonna stop in front of us or is he gonna spray here too?
[93:14.20]He stops right in front of this cart, doesn't he?
[93:15.76]That's what it looks like every time.
[93:19.29]And he stops.
[93:20.23]Okay.
[93:23.99]I'm gonna wait.
[93:24.29]I'm gonna be fucking really, really careful about that.
[93:34.90]Unknown soul, nothing else?
[93:36.27]No other items?
[93:37.39]What about in there?
[93:38.61]No?
[93:39.03]Okay, we're fine.
[93:42.27]I want to go back down.
[93:42.93]Let me open the fog gate first.
[93:47.68]Because he like continues to move, right?
[93:55.41]I'm going to assume that the boss of this level is this dragon lands all the way up there or something, right?
[94:01.20]Let me go back down.
[94:03.06]There's another thing I could have done down here.
[94:04.80]And I can go up, too.
[94:08.28]Holding a shield to the dragon fire?
[94:11.76]It might be effective at some place.
[94:14.59]No?
[94:15.05]How am I supposed to know?
[94:18.75]This is the other place I can go.
[94:20.47]That looks like a guy in here.
[94:23.43]Oh.
[94:25.38]Ah, we meet again.
[94:26.22]Fancy that.
[94:27.62]Hope you find something that suits you.
[94:32.54]Oh.
[94:34.48]Oh.
[94:38.51]Longsword Club.
[94:41.65]Broadsword.
[94:43.41]Claymore.
[94:44.17]These are strength.
[94:46.61]No, it's not.
[94:47.27]Broadsword's not strength.
[94:49.70]Claymore is.
[94:54.50]Plate.
[94:55.79]He sells half-moon.
[94:59.43]He sells his fichu- like, ugh, god damn it.
[95:03.95]I might just do it.
[95:05.75]I'm gonna s- Should I- should I get the claymore?
[95:32.62]I wonder, is it actually worth me buying this claymore?
[95:38.12]Oh, there's a longsword.
[95:39.80]The longsword!
[95:40.62]It's either the claymore or the longsword.
[95:50.95]What do you guys think?
[95:51.75]I'm gonna do a pull.
[95:54.45]Let's do a poll here.
[95:56.53]Claymore or Longsword?
[96:01.29]Strawball.me Claymore.
[96:10.88]Longsword.
[96:14.22]Let's see what people have to say.
[96:18.40]Please vote if you care.
[96:20.46]If you don't, then hey, hope you're enjoying the stream.
[96:26.70]Look at the crossbow.
[96:28.48]No, not behind the crossbow.
[96:38.74]And, like, only 11% voted for the longsword.
[96:45.19]Really?
[96:45.55]Holy shit.
[96:47.61]6,000 souls!
[97:02.05]Should have put the crossbow on the straw foal.
[97:05.33]Alright, well, I have to, like... Do I have enough souls to do this?
[97:10.79]And, like... So, I'm gonna just crush both of these, right?
[97:13.25]Like, the armor spider, I don't need any of these items.
[97:17.00]Both these from the phalanx and the armor spider are useless, right?
[97:22.88]They're not gonna do anything for me.
[97:23.90]I just wanna make... I hold on to these things initially.
[97:27.40]Just because I wanna make sure I'm not gonna do something stupid.
[97:30.40]Save them both.
[97:33.48]No, everyone's like, no!
[97:38.52]Don't crush the Ball Souls.
[97:40.21]Okay.
[97:43.55]So, are the Ball Souls different in this one?
[97:47.99]I need a thousand more, and then a little bit more, so we can do... Let's do one more of these.
[97:56.23]And we'll do one of the little baby ones, right?
[98:05.13]Where is it?
[98:06.83]Unknown soldier soul.
[98:09.89]This one's a little bit, right?
[98:11.51]Yeah, okay.
[98:12.63]I'm buying the claymore.
[98:17.88]Claymore.
[98:19.24]Hopefully I like this weapon because it's 6,000 souls.
[98:21.28]Okay.
[98:21.56]Claymore.
[98:35.56]Now let me just take a look.
[98:36.74]Let's see here.
[98:38.40]Go down.
[98:38.92]So this is the 100 plus 38.
[98:40.38]This is A scaling, that's why.
[98:44.92]More base damage.
[98:49.14]That's fine.
[98:50.96]105 plus 11.
[98:51.70]So it does a little bit less.
[98:52.52]How does it swing?
[98:53.22]How does it handle?
[98:54.48]Well, this thing is huge.
[98:57.28]Oh my god, this thing is gigantic.
[99:02.67]Oh wow, this thing is pretty cool.
[99:04.15]What's the R2?
[99:04.59]Straight overhead.
[99:07.57]This thing is fucking huge.
[99:14.34]This thing is like too big.
[99:16.96]I can't like bring this in a small hallway.
[99:22.77]All right, well, it looks pretty fun.
[99:26.97]The one thing... The other thing I'm gonna ask is should I just buy a bunch of stuff from... Should I buy... Should I crush all my shit and then buy all the half moon from this guy?
[99:36.20]Or should I buy all green?
[99:38.90]Have fun fat rolling.
[99:39.90]I'm not fat rolling right now.
[99:43.20]I'm fine.
[99:44.94]I like the swing pattern though.
[99:45.94]I like it when it goes like a cross.
[99:49.64]Just eat all the souls and buy all the half moon.
[99:51.27]That's what I'm gonna do.
[99:58.85]Buy grass, fight boss.
[100:01.14]Yep, that's... Whatever, I'll just do them one by one.
[100:04.58]Who cares?
[100:12.52]Just buy all green?
[100:15.78]Should I?
[100:16.10]I... I know I'm doing this the absolute worst possible way, but...
[100:33.55]No, all half moon.
[100:38.66]How much can I afford?
[100:39.88]Nine?
[100:43.04]Just buy nine half moon?
[100:45.16]Alright, well, there we go.
[100:56.72]I have a weapon that I think is fun.
[100:58.74]I think it's really cool.
[101:01.04]What does it do?
[101:02.24]Oh, nice.
[101:04.07]Cool.
[101:04.49]It does like a cool little... Oh, dude, do you know what this reminds me of?
[101:07.87]Take a look at this sword, man.
[101:08.75]You tell me this isn't ice from Game of Thrones.
[101:12.23]Nedward Stark's fucking claymore.
[101:15.05]It looks like... It looks like Longclog the Pommel.
[101:18.69]It's a Game of Thrones weapon.
[101:23.35]Oh, fuck.
[101:23.79]Oh, well, Squidward Stark's fucking weapon.
[101:26.81]Okay, what am I doing?
[101:28.15]Going back up.
[101:37.88]Mm-hmm.
[101:39.58]Let's just keep moving.
[101:41.20]Why not, right?
[101:43.28]I gotta go up.
[101:45.31]There might be an item up here.
[101:46.69]This game's fucking fun, man.
[101:50.22]Look at that spread.
[101:52.34]Oh, look at that spread.
[101:53.14]It's beautiful.
[101:53.93]Heavy arrow compound bow.
[101:57.17]Was that compact or compound?
[101:58.65]I don't even know anymore, guys.
[102:06.67]Can I make it if I run forward here?
[102:12.34]I don't think I'm going to be able to make this.
[102:15.32]Can I make this?
[102:19.40]I can't make this, right?
[102:25.83]Jesus.
[102:28.11]Okay, I'm not going to be able to make it all the way up there.
[102:32.93]No way.
[102:34.53]Not in a thousand years.
[102:46.19]I have to try.
[102:46.79]Okay.
[102:47.93]Okay.
[102:54.39]Out of the way.
[102:55.25]You fucked it up.
[102:56.57]No, don't backstab him.
[102:58.15]You just did so much of an animation for no reason.
[103:00.22]Now I'm gonna get stuck.
[103:03.48]I can do it.
[103:03.86]There's all kinds of shiny fucking things.
[103:11.18]No, no, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[103:12.38]Just go.
[103:12.76]Just go.
[103:13.10]Forget it.
[103:13.40]I'm out of stamina.
[103:16.38]And there's a fucking... There's an Isaac over here.
[103:20.13]Excuse me!
[103:20.71]Excuse me!
[103:21.27]Excuse me!
[103:26.56]Oh, oh, oh!
[103:28.58]Wow!
[103:36.31]Oh shit, this is a boss!
[103:37.63]This is a boss!
[103:41.03]Oh no!
[103:42.25]No, this is a boss!
[103:44.17]I didn't know this was gonna- Oh god!
[103:46.67]I'm not ready for this.
[103:51.72]Who's the- What's the boss?
[103:54.92]What is going on?
[103:55.46]Why are they all aiming at me?
[103:58.88]Tower knight.
[104:03.22]Get the fuck away from me!
[104:04.58]Hold on, let me see what's going on here.
[104:18.73]Fucking like 9 health.
[104:25.74]I'm like, what the fuck?
[104:27.64]Okay, go there, like... Look, do you see that room before the boss?
[104:34.19]So, alright.
[104:36.47]How are you actually supposed to fucking get up there?
[104:40.63]Does this guy have to go underground or something?
[104:42.57]How the hell are you supposed to get through this?
[104:47.18]Now I'm just curious.
[104:48.14]I need to know.
[104:49.76]What's the correct way to go past that third tier?
[104:58.74]You know what I'm saying?
[104:59.60]Like, what's the... Do I have to kill this dragon first?
[105:05.62]You just literally run.
[105:06.78]You just have to... What?
[105:09.48]So I have to run and then fight, like, nine people over there.
[105:12.14]Alright, well, get over here and blow fire over here.
[105:17.96]Quick, come on.
[105:18.58]I want to see that again.
[105:32.94]Just run past the dudes.
[105:34.10]I guess so.
[105:36.92]I'm gonna go this way.
[105:46.33]Just go up first.
[105:48.59]Look at the dogs down here again.
[105:51.03]Yeah, there are dogs down here again.
[105:58.56]I don't think I can run by these dogs.
[106:04.73]Yeah, incoming dogs.
[106:14.13]Get the fuck away from me!
[106:20.67]There's like a bunch of random people over here too.
[106:23.13]Hey, remember me?
[106:25.93]You like ran by me.
[106:28.78]I'm behind you now.
[106:36.13]Okay.
[106:39.73]I don't want to... No!
[106:41.29]No!
[106:42.97]No!
[106:43.93]The fucking swing is so big.
[106:46.53]Is that guy going to ever sell to me again?
[106:49.49]That guy's never going to sell to me again.
[106:51.97]Is he?
[106:53.87]That guy... Is that guy going to fuck me up?
[106:56.99]Did I fuck everything up?
[107:02.97]Tell me.
[107:05.99]Is it ruined?
[107:08.34]He's aggroed forever?
[107:13.82]He should be fine.
[107:14.56]Okay, I hope so.
[107:19.08]Okay.
[107:20.46]I fucked it up for real?
[107:21.63]Don't say that.
[107:30.15]Don't tell me that.
[107:37.07]Once the thing's upgraded, this is gonna be fucking beauty.
[107:43.88]This is gonna be a fucking beauty.
[107:47.52]So I have to run this whole way.
[107:49.06]What about that, like, cart right there?
[107:50.88]Can I hide behind that cart?
[107:52.57]I feel like I could do that last time.
[107:59.93]The wagon blocked that damage last time.
[108:06.89]I'm certain of that.
[108:10.97]Come on over here.
[108:14.67]Yeah, yeah, yeah, go do it.
[108:16.27]Let me see how far he goes.
[108:20.35]He starts... He kind of doesn't start here.
[108:23.02]He starts like after the wagon, doesn't he?
[108:26.98]So, does he do it?
[108:28.88]I'm doing a test right now.
[108:30.22]I'm having a hypothesis.
[108:33.38]Yes, okay, my hypothesis is correct.
[108:36.19]So I didn't have to run from there, I can run from like here.
[108:41.10]Go apologize.
[108:51.67]Well, uh... That was almost a disaster.
[109:14.78]Okay, we'll come back here.
[109:16.18]I'm gonna go upgrade the fucking sword.
[109:19.12]All right, we got healing items.
[109:25.90]Oh, what?
[109:26.90]Come on.
[109:27.26]All right, sometimes you gotta laugh about it a little bit, you know what I mean?
[109:33.84]It wouldn't happen if I just said I was sorry.
[109:36.28]You're probably right.
[109:37.30]Let's go upgrade this weapon.
[109:42.09]I need souls?
[109:43.09]What do you mean?
[109:43.59]I have, like, some souls, don't I?
[109:44.81]Alright, upgrade weapon.
[109:49.55]Let me see.
[109:50.01]Claymore.
[109:51.70]Claymore plus one.
[109:53.08]What do I need?
[109:53.44]How many souls do I need?
[109:54.88]550?
[109:56.90]Which one of these?
[109:57.52]Which one of the boss souls am I smashing?
[110:01.90]I'm breaking one of these, right?
[110:03.74]Because one of them is just useless.
[110:08.02]From my understanding, one of these was useless.
[110:10.86]Wasn't it, like, a spell?
[110:15.96]Yeah, the spider one doesn't do anything for me.
[110:22.20]Spiders is a dex weapon.
[110:23.34]Alright.
[110:27.60]Let's break it.
[110:34.92]Let's upgrade this.
[110:38.27]Claymore.
[110:41.23]Plus one.
[110:41.67]Go for it.
[110:44.33]Wait, I want to see something here.
[110:46.42]Does this stay at D or does this eventually get to C scaling?
[110:49.76]I don't know.
[110:51.56]Claymore plus one.
[110:53.44]Claymore plus two.
[110:57.72]What?
[111:00.44]Claymore plus two Claymore.
[111:04.04]So I can downgrade this.
[111:07.13]I can melt it down to a normal Claymore again?
[111:12.93]What does that do?
[111:15.41]Why would you do that?
[111:18.63]Alright, that's plus two.
[111:19.81]Oh man.
[111:20.49]This is gonna be... I'm doing so much more damage.
[111:22.01]Plus three.
[111:24.82]Claymore plus three.
[111:25.68]Claymore.
[111:26.08]Quality Claymore plus one.
[111:31.08]Okay, so it just... That just makes it have like a balanced scale, huh?
[111:38.53]I'm assuming I probably shouldn't do that.
[111:47.67]Go quality.
[111:50.35]But if I do that, aren't I... Crushing is the pure strength infusion, so I shouldn't do quality then.
[112:04.08]No, I'm not gonna... Unless I start putting points into dexterity, which I'm not planning on doing.
[112:08.58]You know what I mean?
[112:12.31]You know what I mean, Vern?
[112:13.35]Let's just buy a bunch of grass. ...
[112:20.40]Yeah, crushing.
[112:21.04]Let's get grass.
[112:32.38]We're just buying up a stock of grass.
[112:35.24]Sell the other weapons.
[112:36.44]I thought you couldn't sell anything in this game.
[112:42.64]Alright, there we go.
[112:46.78]Let's make our inventory not stupid.
[112:54.57]The blacks with the stone fang.
[112:57.33]Oh, that's actually pretty incredible.
[113:00.73]Normal, half, and then... Dark.
[113:09.37]Poison, bleeding.
[113:10.17]I have a lot of those.
[113:13.75]Poison, plague, MP.
[113:16.25]I don't need any of this shit.
[113:17.45]I can resurrect my... I can resurrect!
[113:24.87]You user loser.
[113:29.11]Hungry souls.
[113:29.83]Turpentine.
[113:30.49]Fire.
[113:31.83]I'm just going to have this on the bar.
[113:34.27]Why not?
[113:38.15]Just save one in case I want to dupe it.
[113:42.47]That's just such cheating.
[113:47.98]That is just total cheat.
[113:51.69]Alright, let's give it a shot.
[113:54.55]Let's do something.
[113:57.25]I could try to fight that weird boss or I could go back to where I was before the tower and just make my way around and go in that door and see if I go in that door and kill things.
[114:06.00]You know what I mean?
[114:08.94]Grass is so lame that duping is okay.
[114:12.98]Alright, well let's try to stay legit through the first three or four bosses.
[114:18.20]I'm gonna try.
[114:24.26]You have to be online to do... I mean, I did... I completed this entire area.
[114:32.67]Like, 3-1.
[114:33.35]I might as well, like, finish it, right?
[114:37.89]I got a new weapon.
[114:38.99]Got a new outlook on life.
[114:41.77]It's looking good.
[114:44.28]Let's just not fuck it up.
[114:47.14]There's plenty of potential for that to happen.
[114:48.82]How much more damage am I doing per swing?
[114:50.40]Probably a lot, right?
[114:51.06]Let's test it on this idiot.
[114:55.87]Well, Claymore sounds like it was a pretty good choice.
[114:59.83]Glad I fucking thought of it.
[115:00.83]You know what I mean?
[115:03.87]Glad I came up with the fact that I was going to use the Claymore.
[115:07.27]Glad I thought of it.
[115:08.45]Mm-hmm.
[115:14.16]It's so satisfying.
[115:19.48]Oh, I got a Monday stream, yeah.
[115:21.54]Doing a Monday stream to make up for... Oh, by the way, now that I like this, a lot of people are here.
[115:26.13]There is no stream tomorrow night.
[115:28.93]I have a lot of, like, birthdays this, like, last couple weeks.
[115:31.55]I just, I cannot stream tomorrow night.
[115:34.52]So we're gonna be doing more, like, makeup streams on, like, some random days.
[115:39.94]I have to, uh, get a lot of birthdays out of the way.
[115:42.10]My birthday is this upcoming weekend.
[115:51.90]Mmm, waiting for this guy.
[115:54.39]Go on.
[115:55.13]Turn around, please.
[115:57.25]Turn around.
[115:59.97]Why are you still looking this way?
[116:00.95]Turn around!
[116:03.55]Turn around!
[116:05.87]Turn around!
[116:08.41]Go!
[116:08.85]Oh my god, fine!
[116:14.12]Holy shit, they literally turn around when you run.
[116:18.46]Happy birthday.
[116:19.08]Not yet!
[116:20.37]This coming weekend is my birthday.
[116:23.63]And I'm not going to be here.
[116:27.11]I have a lot of... My family wants to do stuff.
[116:30.85]Me and Kim are going to do something.
[116:31.93]I've got a lot of things to do.
[116:34.71]I don't have any... This is actually kind of bad.
[116:41.95]This is actually... I knew this was going to be bad.
[116:44.11]Because I could smell it from a mile away.
[116:45.77]I don't want to get surrounded.
[116:55.31]Okay... And then... Ah!
[116:59.61]Ah!
[117:01.83]What the fuck?
[117:02.63]I, like, thought I was going the wrong way.
[117:04.83]Oh, god.
[117:05.52]Damn it, man.
[117:06.14]Like, for real.
[117:07.76]What was that scream?
[117:09.28]Oh, my god.
[117:11.16]It was the other way.
[117:11.96]Of course it was.
[117:17.79]I hate that.
[117:18.33]I can't wait to not be... To be done with this particular zone.
[117:22.39]It's giving me, like, pain in my stomach.
[117:28.96]This hurts my stomach.
[117:32.46]Being in the giant rectangle.
[117:36.62]What?
[117:42.69]Did he walk down the hall?
[117:55.47]This place has the best atmosphere in the game?
[117:58.63]The atmosphere is cool.
[118:01.32]But it's just the same cube stacked on top of itself.
[118:10.16]R1, what the hell, man?
[118:15.13]Okay, here we are.
[118:16.81]Please help me, guy.
[118:17.63]You go up.
[118:22.19]And you go down.
[118:24.63]Right?
[118:25.09]Or am I, like, fucking... My whole world is... No.
[118:29.23]I just fell down and went in a circle.
[118:33.30]You gotta go up, and then you gotta go down.
[118:35.06]Do I need to start eating prunes?
[118:42.48]Why would I need to eat prunes?
[118:46.74]I mean, my, like, digestional...
[118:50.12]Digestinal?
[118:51.10]That's not real, right?
[118:52.60]Digestinal?
[118:53.58]Digestive.
[118:54.34]Digestinal.
[118:58.17]There it is.
[119:00.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[119:01.47]Keep going.
[119:05.79]And then I gotta go this way.
[119:07.11]Put this fucking thing up his back.
[119:18.02]And then, I'm going the right way, right?
[119:20.28]There's no hole here, right?
[119:22.86]Right.
[119:23.37]Alright.
[119:23.83]Then we go down, and then we're done.
[119:26.83]And I can finally get out of this nightmare.
[119:38.34]No, it's down.
[119:42.60]Quit making so much noise.
[119:44.16]You're scaring the kids.
[119:49.68]Actually, I can go this way.
[119:50.76]It's probably safer.
[119:55.26]And then I have to first try the boss, right?
[119:57.12]Like, that's... I kind of have to.
[120:07.54]I gotta fight the stupid invader person.
[120:12.65]Actually scared me a little.
[120:13.95]Not gonna lie.
[120:16.61]Should I just kill the invader?
[120:20.57]Or just run by him.
[120:28.32]It's possible, right?
[120:30.54]Although that crossbow does an absolute shitload of damage.
[120:34.50]An absolute shitload of damage.
[120:40.31]There's that.
[120:41.97]Okay, here we go.
[120:49.58]Where are you?
[120:50.16]You're right here somewhere.
[120:55.83]Put on the big boy pants.
[120:57.85]Wait for him to pop out of nowhere.
[120:59.05]There he is.
[121:07.62]Don't take the... Don't do it again.
[121:08.86]I don't like that knife.
[121:28.73]Bring it on.
[121:29.23]Slow and steady wins the race.
[121:30.27]I'm losing the race.
[121:48.33]Whoa!
[121:50.25]No!
[121:52.05]God damn it!
[121:55.10]Oh, I just... Oh, I am so angry.
[122:06.21]Oh, I'm so... That was... What was I doing?
[122:08.67]Why did I even put the fucking shield down?
[122:15.98]What a monumental pain in the ass.
[122:22.88]Fucking does like it's 75% damage with what across the crossbows the worst item in every Dark Souls game What what?
[122:31.90]What why that fucking weapon is so bad Everywhere except this one guy does almost your entire health pool in one shot, and if you and if you try to heal you're dead You're fucking dead.
[122:44.69]You're dead meat buddy.
[122:47.88]Oh That's so I'm so angry oh
[122:52.61]Fuck that person.
[122:56.15]I was about to run into this guy.
[123:10.09]I'm gonna go with a new tactic.
[123:11.84]And it's a tactic that Burger Boy would have done.
[123:13.90]It's the Burger Boy tactic.
[123:14.84]We've talked about it before.
[123:16.46]You just go in and R1 spam the fucking person.
[123:20.18]Just go spam him with R1.
[123:27.59]And you'll win.
[123:29.66]Every time.
[123:33.06]I'm gonna keep going down, right?
[123:40.26]Am I all the way down?
[123:41.09]Yeah.
[123:48.35]Yeah, just watch.
[123:48.87]I'm gonna fucking R1 spam this person.
[123:50.27]And I'm gonna kill him.
[123:56.94]I'm gonna just two-handed R-fucking-1 spam them.
[124:05.19]You just can't... You can't let her shoot the crossbow.
[124:12.90]If she pulls the trigger on that thing, you've already lost.
[124:15.28]Alright, fuck you.
[124:19.04]Come here.
[124:26.23]I love how it does, like, no damage at all to my shield.
[124:29.75]Okay, here we go.
[124:32.19]Get fucking R1 spammed!
[124:38.05]Didn't work.
[124:50.86]Didn't fucking work.
[125:04.01]Bitch!
[125:19.33]More annoying than the boss.
[125:21.33]That's inevitably over here.
[125:33.14]Go ahead.
[125:33.46]Shoot.
[125:33.66]Go ahead.
[125:33.90]I know what you're gonna do.
[125:34.64]I know exact- Go ahead.
[125:35.84]That's fine.
[125:53.22]That was too- That was risky.
[126:17.26]Pull it out.
[126:23.26]Here we go.
[126:26.52]Eat my shit.
[126:27.23]Okay.
[126:28.39]Okay.
[126:32.41]What a fucking R1.
[126:34.27]Stupid.
[126:34.79]A forwarding fucking R1.
[126:36.19]Delete it from your games from software.
[126:37.99]It's useless.
[126:39.33]Why is it in these games?
[126:44.74]I'm so paranoid about that fucking crossbow.
[126:46.42]This could be going so fucking much more smoothly.
[126:48.62]She keeps faking me out.
[126:59.03]I'm going for it.
[126:59.55]Three.
[127:00.55]Two.
[127:01.73]One.
[127:02.09]Action.
[127:03.47]I win.
[127:04.43]Fuck you.
[127:05.01]I didn't win.
[127:08.32]Stupid video game.
[127:10.24]She's dead.
[127:17.49]What did you give me?
[127:19.65]Chunk of Moonlight Stone, Black Eye Stone.
[127:23.41]Okay.
[127:25.81]I was so paranoid that whole fight.
[127:27.35]Like, for good reason.
[127:30.05]I kind of have a decent amount of souls here.
[127:36.48]Um... I don't know.
[127:40.68]Should I... Whatever.
[127:42.08]Let's give this a try.
[127:46.48]Whatever the hell this is.
[127:52.76]Alright, here we go.
[127:54.48]Here we go, I'm ready.
[127:59.79]Why did I never use two-handed R1?
[128:01.19]Because I was terrified of the crossbow.
[128:03.35]That I was gonna get one shot.
[128:06.63]We got like this Medusa-like lady.
[128:12.30]She's holding the book, she's a sorceress, easy.
[128:14.54]Just don't get hit by the sorceress.
[128:15.92]She's gonna shoot it like bolts.
[128:17.84]Gonna have to dodge the bolts.
[128:26.33]What?
[128:26.61]Who are these guys?
[128:30.47]Where is she?
[128:33.13]What am I fighting here?
[128:33.87]Who am I fighting?
[128:35.31]I'm just killing a church worth of people.
[128:38.01]I don't know who I'm supposed to be fighting.
[128:43.77]Do I need to kill these guys next to her?
[128:46.49]I don't know.
[128:48.11]I can't go through the pews.
[128:50.57]Okay, she's not doing anything.
[128:53.21]Thankfully.
[128:55.55]What is this?
[129:06.54]This is how actually like scared of this I'm gonna get too close and she's gonna do like a wave attack and it's gonna kill me See see see.
[129:14.59]What was that?
[129:19.47]Oh Okay, she goes ah and then a beam comes out Okay She's like
[129:29.93]I knew she had a bolt.
[129:31.25]I knew it.
[129:36.59]Wow!
[129:38.13]What the fuck is this move?
[129:42.87]My heart hurts.
[129:45.60]Huh?
[129:47.12]What was that?
[129:48.84]I just stepped in a fucking Artemis trap.
[129:50.90]Alright, we're going for it.
[130:00.29]Huh?
[130:00.55]What's that move?
[130:02.45]I picked up... I just... What did I get?
[130:03.65]I got a weapon.
[130:04.15]I picked up a fucking knife.
[130:05.81]It's a knife on the ground.
[130:13.49]Wait a minute.
[130:15.05]Hold on.
[130:16.27]Where... Owie, owie, owie.
[130:19.03]I think I understand.
[130:21.25]She puts Artemis traps down.
[130:22.59]There was one over here.
[130:33.60]Okay.
[130:33.70]Alright, I just gotta pay attention.
[130:37.02]Look.
[130:37.96]Paige, look where they are.
[130:38.94]Where are they?
[130:39.28]Okay, there's one there.
[130:42.73]Not one behind her.
[130:50.45]What the fuck?
[130:52.03]Wait a minute.
[130:52.37]What?
[130:52.95]Oh my god.
[130:53.37]Wait a minute.
[130:54.53]Is it more than... What?
[130:55.25]There's more than one person?
[130:56.19]Okay, there's two now.
[130:59.80]Oh, Jesus Christ almighty.
[131:04.96]I didn't even see where the hell the other one was over here.
[131:12.30]Give me a second.
[131:15.70]Oh my god, this is such a bad spot.
[131:19.76]Oh my god.
[131:32.36]Oh, you know what's a good idea, Jeremy?
[131:33.62]To turn your back and not see where it is.
[131:37.28]It's three now.
[131:38.38]I'm glad I fucking turned around and didn't even watch where she was putting the next trap.
[131:44.34]Oh, you are a dumb boy.
[131:46.94]You are a dumb boy.
[131:51.75]It's gotta be the one back here.
[131:59.63]Holy shit, I'm dead.
[132:03.35]That was fun.
[132:23.11]Fuck.
[132:28.09]Well, so it's a combination of the witch.
[132:32.71]It's a combination of the Witch and the Crystal Sage.
[132:37.71]Alright, I understand.
[132:39.45]And there's artifice traps on the ground.
[132:41.97]You got it.
[132:42.33]Move out of the way.
[132:55.42]Excuse me.
[132:56.07]Don't blow this for me, buddy.
[133:09.09]At least she's not gonna get revived?
[133:10.49]Wait, what do you mean, revived?
[133:15.93]I'm taking the longest route to the boss?
[133:17.93]Am I really?
[133:19.97]What's the shortcut?
[133:21.77]What's the shortcut then?
[133:24.52]I'm gonna have to beat her now, first try.
[133:26.00]If you're gonna give it to me, I might as well take it, right?
[133:40.94]So where's the easiest way to get over here?
[133:44.66]Did I miss something?
[133:45.74]Is there like a better way to get here?
[133:59.33]No, the arrow shooting machine is just the shortcut.
[134:01.71]Okay.
[134:05.52]Just for me to look at it.
[134:06.44]Let me just make sure I know where the hell I'm going.
[134:09.24]So you come straight through here.
[134:17.93]So it's out of this door.
[134:19.71]I need to see it.
[134:20.85]Otherwise I'll never be able to do it.
[134:22.93]I have to watch it.
[134:23.73]I have to know where it is.
[134:26.05]So this is like the big scary fat guy.
[134:31.21]Okay.
[134:31.77]I don't necessarily remember exactly how to get down there.
[134:37.33]Whatever.
[134:37.61]I just have to beat her.
[134:42.76]It's not that short.
[134:43.74]You can jump two floors, really.
[134:47.48]Oh well.
[134:50.10]Okay.
[134:51.24]Let's try this again.
[134:53.46]This time I gotta just be careful of... And I can't... It's not even worth attacking the other witches.
[135:02.30]So, this boss is going to be a huge pain in my ass, because if you guys watched my Dark Souls 3 playthrough on stream... You remember the Crystal Sage?
[135:10.91]Remember how, for some reason, it just gave me an aneurysm and I couldn't do it?
[135:17.97]Well, I have no idea if that's going to happen now, but it very well could.
[135:24.55]I also don't know if I should be killing these guys.
[135:30.63]I feel like I should because they're probably going to be a pain in the ass.
[135:34.52]Can I actually destroy the pews?
[135:37.32]I don't think I can.
[135:41.02]She does like a beam.
[135:42.04]Oh, this is going to be hard.
[135:43.50]And you know what?
[135:44.52]I had an opportunity to not be a moron.
[135:49.65]Okay.
[135:51.17]So she shoots big ones.
[135:57.57]What?
[135:57.73]They're still there?
[135:58.49]They're still there after you get... They don't clear.
[136:02.15]Okay, they're there permanently.
[136:04.43]Alright.
[136:05.61]I thought that they were going to be cleared once you stepped on them once.
[136:10.82]That's not the case.
[136:11.68]Alright, they're all dead.
[136:17.66]Go ahead.
[136:18.00]Come on.
[136:18.28]Do your little song.
[136:24.07]She's gonna go boom.
[136:24.68]Alright, now I need to make sure I know where the hell they're going.
[136:30.14]There's the two of them and... Pay attention.
[136:36.12]There's not one over here.
[136:42.45]Oh god.
[136:42.95]Give me a fucking break.
[136:44.33]This stupid piece of shit stool is what blocked me.
[136:48.71]This dumb fucking stool.
[136:51.83]Yeah, I got stool for you.
[137:08.03]Wait a second.
[137:08.61]Wait a minute.
[137:09.05]Wait, wait, wait.
[137:09.61]Just give me a second.
[137:10.27]Let me just plan this.
[137:18.26]Just easy.
[137:18.96]Just watch where they're going.
[137:20.14]Just easy.
[137:21.78]Okay.
[137:23.36]There's not one there.
[137:24.78]Hopefully, that's the real one.
[137:31.51]And who is shooting?
[137:32.29]Who's shooting the big one?
[137:34.67]Hey.
[137:36.03]How did that get by?
[137:38.61]Alright, it's the one in the middle.
[137:40.51]Here we go.
[137:41.17]One, two, three.
[137:47.06]There she goes.
[137:47.66]Okay, now we get a look.
[137:56.25]Pay attention.
[137:57.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[137:57.81]What are you doing here?
[137:58.41]What are you doing right in front of me?
[137:59.61]Hey!
[138:01.69]Okay, not one right here.
[138:03.49]That's not her.
[138:05.70]Where is she?
[138:08.94]She's... Okay, she's all the way I didn't even see where the fuck the other one was.
[138:11.53]How am I gonna get around that?
[138:14.03]I'm gonna go around the right side.
[138:15.17]She's right there.
[138:16.15]Okay, Ducky, let's move.
[138:23.94]Okay, we're gonna go this way.
[138:26.36]Watch out for this fucking stool.
[138:40.69]We're gonna take this real slow, guys.
[138:42.43]I don't think you understand this.
[138:44.99]Let me tell you, just so you understand.
[138:46.65]We're gonna go slow.
[138:49.78]Ow, dick!
[138:52.84]Eat it, you fucking dummy!
[138:53.88]Alright, where are we going?
[139:06.46]There's one right behind me.
[139:11.65]Where are they?
[139:13.17]Oh, fucking hell.
[139:15.17]Oh.
[139:15.55]My.
[139:16.07]God.
[139:16.53]In heaven.
[139:18.84]We're gonna go all the way back.
[139:19.60]There he is.
[139:22.10]There, there, there, there, there, there, there.
[139:23.06]Right there, right there, right there.
[139:23.88]Easy, easy.
[139:24.32]Full health.
[139:24.72]Don't be an idiot.
[139:30.94]And... Go!
[139:33.39]Eat shit!
[139:36.99]I gotta hit her one more time.
[139:38.02]I'm gonna hide back here.
[139:40.92]Just stay back here.
[139:42.26]Stay back here with the fool's gold!
[139:45.98]Am I safe?
[139:48.29]Okay, we're safe right here.
[139:49.85]I know where they are.
[139:51.23]Where are you?
[139:53.57]You're all the way in the fucking back.
[139:55.73]Oh, you bitch.
[139:57.90]You bitch.
[140:05.75]Don't freeze me, please.
[140:06.77]All I want is fucking free food from Denny's.
[140:13.53]This one right here?
[140:15.37]I forget.
[140:16.47]I forget.
[140:16.83]No, it's yours.
[140:18.31]Oh, shit in my fucking underwear.
[140:25.94]Do not... Okay, we win.
[140:28.44]We win.
[140:28.96]Game over.
[140:29.36]We win the game.
[140:36.49]Alright, she's dead.
[140:37.15]I got her.
[140:37.83]I win.
[140:42.32]That's a lot of souls.
[140:43.44]That's a lot of souls.
[140:44.68]Alright, second try.
[140:48.08]I'm okay with that.
[140:49.60]I'm okay with a second try victory.
[140:53.24]Oh no, what's going on?
[141:00.98]What happened?
[141:10.39]Free food at Denny's.
[141:15.25]What is this?
[141:16.57]Oh, this is the... This is the... We pick you up and... This is not the second part of the boss, is it?
[141:22.32]They didn't start doing this dumb shit to the Bloodborne DLC.
[141:25.64]Uh...
[141:35.66]Where the hell am I going?
[141:46.82]Okay.
[141:50.91]The dead guys walk over the traps and show you where they are.
[141:53.59]You're not supposed to kill them.
[141:57.01]Wait, did I not even get the boss soul?
[142:02.45]I'm confused.
[142:06.34]I killed every single person.
[142:09.66]Oh, okay, there it is.
[142:10.18]I was going to say, did I do something wrong?
[142:13.54]It's all demon soul.
[142:17.48]And this is 3-2, right?
[142:20.68]Nice, okay.
[142:22.94]Secrets?
[142:23.36]No.
[142:24.02]Alright, let's just go back and level up.
[142:25.48]I'm not going to fuck around right now.
[142:28.70]I'll level up a couple times and get some stuff.
[142:35.94]I need to jump down.
[142:37.02]I don't believe you.
[142:45.57]What do we got?
[142:47.63]Seek soul power.
[142:48.43]What do you think?
[142:51.65]Another point in strength.
[142:52.91]Vitality.
[142:53.47]Let's do strength again.
[142:54.69]We'll do two in strength.
[142:59.20]I'm going to crush one and put one in endurance.
[143:01.58]Okay.
[143:07.33]Have them some things to crush.
[143:11.03]What about that doll soul?
[143:12.07]Is that worth anything for me?
[143:19.32]I can't do plus four.
[143:24.46]I need eight.
[143:25.86]Let's do one point in endurance.
[143:35.31]What's my opinion on the game?
[143:44.45]It bounces back and forth like a pinball machine, but in all honesty, I'm gonna be completely honest, you take out this like awkward mess of a healing mechanic that's in Demon's Souls, and I would probably put this above Dark Souls 1 and Dark Souls 2.
[144:03.86]Just like so far.
[144:07.11]For me, Bloodborne and Dark Souls 3 are, like, the best.
[144:10.12]By far.
[144:11.00]Bloodborne, then Dark Souls 3.
[144:12.92]And then I would probably put... Just so far, Demon's Souls would probably be next.
[144:17.34]And then Dark Souls 2.
[144:19.38]And then... And then, like, my Barbie fucking funhouse.
[144:22.62]And then Dark Souls 1.
[144:23.40]Alright, let me... I'm gonna go to the other blacksmith.
[144:40.66]This idiot likes Dark Souls 3.
[144:42.52]What?
[144:42.71]Dark Souls 3 was fantastic.
[144:49.79]Bloodborne is the absolute, just, it's just the best game.
[144:56.35]Every weapon in Bloodborne was, like, fun to use.
[144:58.90]It wasn't, like, okay, so in, like, all the Dark Souls games, yeah, it's cool to be able to pick up, like, a hundred different weapons, but when 91 of them are not worth using...
[145:09.14]You know, all the boss soul weapons that just don't do anything.
[145:11.78]Like, there's like fucking, through the whole series of Dark Souls, there's like, there's like 45, like, there's like 60 boss soul weapons, and like one of them is worth putting on.
[145:23.12]All the weapons in Bloodborne, some of them might have been terrible, but they were still, like, you could still use them.
[145:28.20]There was only like 25 weapons in the whole game.
[145:38.60]So, even though there were less weapons in Bloodborne, they were all, like, unique.
[145:46.53]What about the cane?
[145:47.41]Well, I mean, the cane is... But the cane was dumb and fun.
[145:51.71]The cane... If you were doing, like, a shit strategy, and you wanted to show people how good you were at video games, you played through with the cane.
[146:04.40]Dark Souls 3 took the best of Bloodborne and made it a Dark Souls game.
[146:08.58]That was my opinion.
[146:09.58]But I still think Bloodborne is like a better full experience.
[146:13.64]Especially with the DLC.
[146:16.38]The Dark Souls DLC was a lot more to be desired for this.
[146:20.70]You guys watched me play it all on stream.
[146:24.50]The Bloodborne DLC was... fucking fantastic.
[146:29.89]It was perfect.
[146:32.21]Perfect deal.
[146:33.17]What do we got?
[146:34.81]What can you do?
[146:35.59]Quality crushing claymore.
[146:38.33]This is the one I want, right?
[146:51.18]Well, I can't do it yet.
[146:53.29]But I can eventually.
[147:05.00]I guess I'm just going to go buy... I'm just going to go buy enough.
[147:15.63]Whatever.
[147:17.37]We'll farm some worms.
[147:19.30]I'm not going to be a worm farmer, am I not?
[147:23.30]Ashes of Luigi was ass.
[147:25.08]Ring City was pretty good.
[147:27.56]Yeah, I don't know.
[147:28.96]I would give the Dark Souls 3 DLC like a 7 out of 10.
[147:31.60]Man, where am I going, boys and girls?
[147:36.28]Gotta go in there for no reason.
[147:44.41]Come on.
[147:46.93]I did it again.
[147:47.61]It's not gonna kill me, just land here.
[147:56.36]Imagine if I just crushed this guy.
[147:59.90]For a second, I thought that was the guy's body.
[148:02.46]I thought it was that guy's body.
[148:05.18]Oops.
[148:10.10]Okay, bye.
[148:10.50]Alright, I did what I can do.
[148:19.67]Where, um... Where do I go now?
[148:23.47]I guess I could do that boss at...
[148:26.31]1, 2.
[148:27.93]Give it a try.
[148:28.87]Actually attempt it.
[148:29.59]Or I could go somewhere else.
[148:34.82]I'm going to say big deal.
[148:36.26]Just because I know where to go here.
[148:39.46]Let's just try to fight this actual boss.
[148:44.86]Would I play Dark Souls 1 again on stream?
[148:49.32]Dark Souls series is dead horse and no new games needed.
[148:53.75]Did I play Dark Souls 1 with DS fix?
[148:56.43]I believe I did when I played it.
[148:57.97]I'm fairly certain of that.
[149:01.23]It's not that... Actually, no, I don't want to do this.
[149:05.50]No.
[149:07.54]I'm going to die to the boss.
[149:08.76]I have no idea what the hell he does.
[149:09.84]I'm obviously going to die my first attempt.
[149:14.84]I'm going to go to another area.
[149:16.26]I'm going to get one, two.
[149:20.33]Two, two.
[149:22.79]Two, two.
[149:28.59]We get 2, 2, 3, 2.
[149:33.02]4, 1.
[149:34.12]Now I think I might be prepared to go through 4, 1.
[149:36.54]What do you think?
[149:39.00]I think this is a good idea.
[149:46.73]I join and it's a number stream.
[149:51.97]Okay.
[149:55.05]Let's do it.
[149:57.65]I'm a big boy now.
[149:58.43]This shouldn't be a problem.
[150:04.01]Oh, that's unfortunate.
[150:05.15]Oh, that's really unfortunate.
[150:06.01]I thought he was going to die in two swings.
[150:07.15]That's always the worst.
[150:09.01]When you're just so confident he's dead on the second swing.
[150:10.85]And then you just go so, so much overconfidence.
[150:13.21]And it's just terrible.
[150:14.43]You're fucking insidious slow.
[150:16.21]It's your downfall killer.
[150:17.33]Remember that game that I said I was going to beat?
[150:27.02]Okay, so it's two with the two hand.
[150:30.76]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[150:34.00]Bring it down, come on!
[150:43.04]Holy shit, that hurt.
[150:45.64]He just like took me out.
[150:53.06]Another one.
[150:54.30]These guys do drop a lot of souls for like an early game.
[151:00.81]Backstep it quick before he comes over here.
[151:11.80]You can't escape my spread, buddy.
[151:19.40]Holy arrow.
[151:27.07]Demon's Souls would be the best to fix, like, the shitty stuff.
[151:29.62]You know, the more that I play this game, the more I actually enjoy all the shit that's in it.
[151:36.36]I think it's very, very good.
[151:42.86]How do I get over there?
[151:44.38]Is there, like, a secret way I can get over there?
[151:48.38]Uh... I don't think so.
[151:58.00]No, that's not going to work.
[152:03.26]Takes some getting used to.
[152:04.08]Oh, there was a point... I got to a point where I was fucking angry at this game.
[152:08.68]And I, like, hated it.
[152:10.80]You saw that last stream when I was like, this game sucks.
[152:13.46]It's not even fun.
[152:14.30]Like, why would they even... This game's dumb.
[152:15.94]Patch it.
[152:17.82]No, I'm over it.
[152:20.12]I'm going to be silent as a mouse here.
[152:32.63]Oh, fuck, okay.
[152:33.63]Forgot about this.
[152:34.21]I'm gonna fucking die here.
[152:42.96]Oh, you dumb mother- you stupid piece of shit.
[152:46.30]Like, really?
[152:49.70]That's unbelievable.
[153:03.01]You have a lot of fucking health.
[153:04.25]There's one idiot behind me.
[153:12.66]Throwing the fucking... Shooting that shit at me.
[153:26.81]Whoa!
[153:27.51]Don't you do that, buddy.
[153:32.64]soul remains.
[153:34.42]Watch out, he's got dual katanas.
[153:41.00]He's dual dead now, you know what I mean?
[153:45.98]Can he hit me from here?
[153:47.14]He probably can.
[153:51.78]Hold your horses, ladies and gentlemen.
[154:00.27]What's up with this?
[154:01.89]There's no... A scaling for, like, magic?
[154:13.14]It's a really odd weapon.
[154:14.64]Okay.
[154:15.62]Whatever.
[154:20.62]Not a strength weapon, in fact.
[154:21.92]There's a red line through strength.
[154:25.75]That's just great.
[154:28.67]Nothing else I can do over here?
[154:35.68]Wasn't somebody telling me to get that weapon?
[154:39.69]I swear, somebody was saying, Jerma, Jerma, you gotta get the Falchion.
[154:44.09]And I was like, why?
[154:44.75]And they're like, get it!
[154:45.57]I was like, okay.
[154:53.26]The last time I came up here, it was bad.
[154:54.52]That, like, manatee was shooting at me from, like, over there.
[155:01.71]See?
[155:11.96]Back it up.
[155:12.46]Back it up.
[155:13.28]Back it up.
[155:13.84]Easy.
[155:14.14]Okay, he's dead.
[155:18.75]Watch out.
[155:23.43]Fucking flying manatees.
[155:24.77]Alright, I gotta get these guys with the double swing.
[155:26.05]Gotta kill them both right now.
[155:29.55]Got it.
[155:29.79]Did they drop anything?
[155:33.50]No.
[155:38.24]Anything else over here?
[155:39.86]That I should be aware of?
[155:43.64]I'm not getting shot up by the manatees, though.
[155:46.34]Somehow.
[155:46.68]Don't touch that thing, whatever it is.
[155:53.09]Copper key.
[155:55.95]Alright, well, I'm gonna step on it and then dodge.
[156:01.13]Okay.
[156:03.53]I got a key.
[156:13.63]So what does that key do?
[156:16.66]I don't know.
[156:17.90]I'm sure we'll find out, boys and girls.
[156:23.12]Just gonna keep moving.
[156:26.47]Indiana Jones.
[156:28.31]Kind of.
[156:31.63]I'm gonna fall down here, right?
[156:34.40]There's nowhere else for me to go from here.
[156:37.44]Just take it slow.
[156:38.86]I'm gonna take it slow.
[156:39.60]We're not gonna pull corners.
[156:40.62]We're not gonna rip around.
[156:41.58]We're gonna... You see?
[156:42.38]This is why you take it slow.
[156:45.97]And, like, okay, he guard broke the shit out of me.
[156:47.71]But, like, I mean, we're just, like, stuck in this fucking tiny little hall.
[156:57.31]There's not much either one of us can do.
[156:58.51]So, like, might as well, like, pull him out here.
[157:01.79]Like, just get behind him and shove the sword up his ass.
[157:07.23]Whatever.
[157:15.67]This place is filled with nothing but skeletons and dex- Dex builds!
[157:23.96]Okay, this is definitely a Ligure wall.
[157:30.38]That's certain of that one.
[157:36.70]What is this for, though?
[157:37.66]Is there anything... I'm gonna get hit by something.
[157:40.82]I'm... This is gonna drop.
[157:41.78]Look, there's like a hole there.
[157:42.68]I hear the twinkle.
[157:48.12]But where is it?
[157:49.20]I'm gonna lose it.
[157:49.72]It's gonna run.
[157:50.76]I knew you'd fucking come for me.
[157:55.47]Oh my fucking lord.
[157:57.07]We're gonna have to be fucking... We're gonna have to be fucking just...
[158:28.26]Okay.
[158:29.22]Well, I still hear the twinkle.
[158:31.72]Where is it?
[158:32.10]There's another wall.
[158:38.52]What is this fucking thing?
[158:39.68]There's like a thing there.
[158:41.40]What am I doing?
[158:46.48]I don't know.
[158:47.02]I'm like scared right now.
[158:49.46]This is where the manatee is, right?
[158:50.72]I remember I came up here before.
[158:51.96]There's the fat guy.
[158:54.50]Not going up there yet.
[158:55.36]Hold on.
[159:03.73]There's a way to go over here.
[159:10.19]Where is he?
[159:11.49]I can hear him.
[159:12.01]He's down here somewhere.
[159:17.93]Where the hell is he?
[159:19.89]He's over here.
[159:21.27]Where are you?
[159:23.98]Is there another illusion wall?
[159:27.98]That I'm not seeing?
[159:36.91]You can hear him, right?
[159:37.79]I mean, I can hear him.
[159:49.39]Who's that guy?
[159:53.54]Wait, I got the key.
[159:54.22]I can open this door, right?
[159:55.84]Hey, dude.
[160:00.30]Hello?
[160:03.50]Phew, you saved me.
[160:05.70]Heavens, I can't believe I fell for that trap.
[160:08.86]I suppose I owe you now.
[160:09.96]You do.
[160:10.50]I'm gravely obliged.
[160:12.48]As thanks, I can provide you with useful goods.
[160:15.48]Nice.
[160:16.50]Who couldn't do with a little help down in these parts?
[160:21.14]Buy item?
[160:21.72]What do you got?
[160:22.74]Oh, he sells half moon.
[160:26.44]Cloud stone.
[160:27.26]Well, there's the falchion.
[160:33.15]What else you got?
[160:37.03]Leather, leather, leather.
[160:39.21]Bunch of half moon.
[160:40.29]And I got a lot of souls, so you know what?
[160:41.97]Let's just buy the fucking store up.
[160:55.34]Thank you.
[160:56.24]This shrine was used in a ghastly ritual by an ancient tribe.
[161:00.84]They've long perished, and now demons have put souls to work.
[161:05.80]At least here you're killing things that are already dead, like skeletons and shadow lurkers.
[161:11.39]That's what I like about this place.
[161:12.55]Better than killing those poor soul-starved humans.
[161:16.43]Anything else?
[161:16.95]Better than killing them.
[161:18.87]Well, satisfied.
[161:19.77]Thank you.
[161:20.15]May we have a look.
[161:22.24]Thanks for the stuff, buddy.
[161:23.22]And there's something in the corner.
[161:24.72]What did you not pick up?
[161:26.04]You know you can eat those.
[161:30.86]More walls.
[161:32.12]Is there an illusion over here?
[161:34.58]There is a twinkle bug, but I don't know where he is.
[161:38.30]There's probably another wall somewhere.
[161:39.56]I don't know.
[161:39.92]Whatever.
[161:40.26]Fuck it.
[161:40.54]Let's just go.
[161:45.71]I can hear it.
[161:47.53]It's probably above me in a weird spot.
[161:49.43]Let's just keep moving.
[161:51.92]Keep moving.
[162:00.19]We got back behind here.
[162:01.61]Mm-hmm.
[162:08.30]Unknown soul.
[162:10.50]Go down.
[162:11.30]There's a... Okay.
[162:12.44]I got to be careful because I'm going to get... Someone's going to shoot me right in the back and I'm going to fall down this hole.
[162:15.94]I knew it.
[162:17.44]Didn't have to throw me in the back.
[162:18.33]You threw me in the front.
[162:20.58]You threw at me in the front.
[162:22.68]You know, and I respect that.
[162:24.66]I respect you for that.
[162:25.37]Okay, this is... Be fucking careful.
[162:31.63]Hey!
[162:32.65]That's why.
[162:33.07]You know, where's he coming from?
[162:36.57]Just, you know, I gotta move.
[162:37.87]I gotta move.
[162:38.73]Watch it.
[162:39.07]Don't freak out, though, because you're gonna aggro the whole fucking camp.
[162:43.81]Ooh!
[162:44.45]That went right by my face.
[162:48.26]Come on, come down here.
[162:49.52]Just let me just get over here.
[162:50.72]Please just get over here.
[162:52.06]Let me just get one of you at a time.
[162:53.08]What are you doing?
[162:53.96]Why are you just staring at me?
[162:55.40]Walk at me.
[162:55.98]No, I don't want to use those yet.
[163:05.87]Where is he?
[163:12.87]I want to use the shitty ones first, because if I can keep progressing, then that's fine.
[163:16.37]There's a fucking scary guy in there.
[163:18.05]Do not go to the scary guy yet.
[163:21.97]Without a doubt.
[163:27.93]That would be a massive mistake if I were to do that right now.
[163:32.69]I did it anyways!
[163:33.79]Did it anyways, guys!
[163:37.09]And the fucking manatee is shooting at me from behind.
[163:42.16]Can we please move out of the way?
[163:44.18]All the chairs and shit.
[163:47.46]I'll fight him in here.
[163:50.22]Is he gonna follow me down here?
[163:51.10]Yes, he is.
[163:51.44]Okay.
[164:04.29]Oh, that's not a backstab.
[164:06.92]Bullshit.
[164:45.27]I win.
[164:47.33]You idiot.
[164:50.59]Pick it up.
[164:50.93]You dummy.
[164:55.62]I got the brains.
[164:56.76]What do you have?
[165:00.82]What item was he protecting in here?
[165:05.48]The floor is gonna fall, isn't it?
[165:09.02]It's like a big shield.
[165:11.76]What else is down here?
[165:12.79]I just want to exhaust my options.
[165:16.21]Don't want to miss something in the wall.
[165:18.41]A little sidestepper.
[165:19.45]Watch out for this.
[165:20.93]I don't know where it's going to come from.
[165:21.85]Where's it going to come from?
[165:22.63]Behind me?
[165:23.09]Yep.
[165:23.39]There it is.
[165:24.71]Thought you could fool me, but you can't.
[165:25.97]Alright, we're fine.
[165:31.33]Hero's soul.
[165:32.07]I have no more standard healing.
[165:40.83]See, this is, this is, this is, this is what I'm talking about.
[165:42.89]You gotta, I can't... There's gonna be an item over here or something, right?
[165:47.22]Yeah, of course there is.
[165:50.28]Is that it?
[165:51.54]Is there anything more?
[165:52.48]Is there a down?
[165:53.10]Should I go down?
[165:53.74]There's gonna be like a secret down here, right?
[165:57.52]This is demons, this is a Dark Souls game.
[165:59.39]Of course there's gonna be something over here.
[166:03.17]Right?
[166:05.11]Look at this tiny little ledge.
[166:06.89]Don't hit me.
[166:07.89]I'm gonna get shot by one of those spirits.
[166:10.94]Oh, there's like a king over here.
[166:13.62]There's a fucking king over here.
[166:16.13]This is not, that's not a secret.
[166:17.97]That's not a secret that I wanted to do.
[166:19.25]Oh, man.
[166:23.52]Oh, man.
[166:53.18]God fucking damn it man like I turned the corner and there's like a secret like mini boss like jacked golden person
[167:01.51]We'll go around the ledge.
[167:02.83]Look what's over here, man.
[167:04.05]Oh, cool.
[167:04.45]There's like a secret ledge you found.
[167:06.18]Good job.
[167:06.68]No, it's just... I lost all the soul.
[167:09.20]You know, I'm just fucking so, so angry.
[167:15.82]Turn this corner, man.
[167:16.75]It's cool.
[167:17.13]There's a fucking, like, really hard enemy right around the corner.
[167:20.13]We make funny games where we troll you.
[167:22.47]We troll you.
[167:23.47]Ha ha.
[167:37.61]Fucking assholes.
[167:38.47]I didn't dodge that.
[167:45.81]I would rather fucking... What are you doing?
[167:50.34]Fine, just stay there.
[167:51.02]I can get back there easily.
[167:57.82]What a pain in the sausage.
[168:05.03]Just dupe the souls.
[168:06.17]Nice fucking cartwheel.
[168:09.91]And I'm just on tilt right now.
[168:13.81]I can't believe that, like, I was expecting, like, a fucking item.
[168:18.45]And no.
[168:18.99]Nope.
[168:20.05]It's just, why the fuck would there ever be, like, a safety thing over there?
[168:22.55]And I'm, like, using all these healing as shouldn't be.
[168:25.75]Fucking god.
[168:33.02]Watch out for this guy.
[168:49.31]Fuck you.
[168:59.03]What?
[168:59.97]What?
[169:01.87]What is with this backstab?
[169:03.25]What is with this backstab?
[169:07.05]I'm not from your country.
[169:08.85]What is with this backstab?
[169:13.58]Easy.
[169:15.56]Go the right way, please.
[169:18.90]That's not the right way.
[169:28.13]That's fine.
[169:29.17]I don't care.
[169:29.63]I'm not going to fight the golden king that's behind the corner.
[169:33.08]I just wanted to progress in the level and I got too curious.
[169:37.26]Curiosity killed the guy playing Dark Souls.
[169:40.34]I should have known better.
[169:58.43]No, I'm using too much healing.
[170:05.87]I'm trying... Dude, you guys know when you fucking just... My brain is just stuck right now.
[170:17.18]They need to do like a psychological study on this game.
[170:21.58]Have any scientists done a study?
[170:25.39]Study.
[170:27.55]Because, like, why do we fucking play these games?
[170:31.38]We just, like, hate ourselves.
[170:35.94]I could be taking a bath right now.
[170:37.66]You know what I mean?
[170:38.28]I could be in a bathtub.
[170:40.20]Fucking just sinking in the water.
[170:43.71]With, like, a bunch of, like, sage and... Like, some daffodils and shit and flowers in the fucking water.
[170:53.95]I could be doing that right now.
[170:58.74]I would stream me in a bath.
[171:06.54]Nothing else.
[171:16.65]Do it.
[171:17.01]Do it.
[171:18.83]I'm not even going the right way.
[171:20.19]I've lost all control.
[171:24.74]I got something of guidance, and now I'm at the tree.
[171:28.21]Oh, this is pickle pee?
[171:39.67]Sparkly twinkly.
[171:42.91]How do you do?
[171:43.39]Oh, okay.
[171:43.89]I drop like a pebble on the ground or something, right?
[171:50.51]You drop a pebble on the ground and pickle pee.
[171:57.43]What do I got?
[171:59.49]What does he want?
[171:59.95]He wants, like, a funny stone?
[172:09.10]Give Pickle Rick.
[172:10.06]I don't think I, like, have anything.
[172:19.52]Drop a pebble?
[172:20.76]Yeah, well, I don't think I have any stuff.
[172:33.33]Drop one of these.
[172:34.03]I'm still on that radio.
[172:35.19]It's a guiding light.
[172:36.73]Drop.
[172:39.99]Drop one.
[172:42.36]Okay.
[172:48.56]Wait.
[172:51.98]Where's my item?
[172:56.27]Where's my shit?
[172:58.81]I just made him happy.
[172:59.77]Hold on.
[173:00.37]Drop one.
[173:02.88]Okay.
[173:11.24]Now what do I get?
[173:12.76]You gonna give me something, dude?
[173:17.04]I have to come back to this area.
[173:18.34]Just reload the game.
[173:38.84]You have to save and quit, you stupid bastard.
[173:41.46]Hey!
[173:45.68]Restart Windows XP.
[173:58.76]What do you mean it didn't save?
[173:59.88]What are you talking about?
[174:03.30]It didn't save.
[174:07.91]It just comes right here.
[174:10.91]And there's what I get, right?
[174:13.49]White arrow.
[174:15.45]Should I just give him more of these?
[174:23.29]Can I just do this again?
[174:24.15]Can I give him the same thing?
[174:26.27]Take another one.
[174:32.34]So do I just have to keep, like, reloading?
[174:51.75]Uh... Give the brass telescope.
[175:06.84]He already has that.
[175:07.72]Well, he can have another one!
[175:08.74]You can only be exchanged once per- Okay, fine.
[175:21.91]Take my fucking telescope, then.
[175:28.05]Here we go.
[175:31.87]Nice and happy.
[175:33.65]All right.
[175:34.29]I'll be back again.
[175:35.39]I'll see you later, bird.
[175:36.71]I'll be back in like five seconds.
[175:43.89]How many times am I going to do this?
[175:55.86]Wait, what am I doing?
[175:56.46]What are you talking about?
[176:00.71]What?
[176:00.91]Yeah, why is it supposed to give the brass telescope?
[176:02.67]What else am I gonna use the telescope?
[176:05.30]How am I gonna use the telescope?
[176:10.12]Fragrant ring.
[176:10.88]Alright, what did you just... What is that?
[176:19.98]Recover MP.
[176:20.82]Alright.
[176:23.18]What else do I have that's, like, shiny?
[176:24.30]I don't think I... This one?
[176:29.66]No.
[176:36.59]Drop the... Drop some turpentine.
[176:40.29]Hey, I'll drop some sticky white stuff on the ground.
[176:45.63]Give the ring back.
[176:48.91]Well, okay.
[176:50.46]That was fun.
[176:51.04]Thanks, bird.
[176:52.04]Maybe next time we'll have more of a substantial... Ooh, sparkly-warkly, tinky-winky!
[177:08.00]Get over here, you little shit.
[177:14.86]I can just keep moving, right?
[177:30.51]Uh, yes!
[177:36.41]Use a falling attack?
[177:37.23]The falling attack is not in Demon's Souls.
[177:40.39]There is no falling attack in Demon's Souls.
[177:45.74]Sorry, you're not going to be able to jebait me.
[177:51.44]Because I've already been jebaited.
[177:53.66]Many times.
[177:55.38]Alright, let's... What's the proper route here?
[177:58.00]What's the proper way to get the fudge out of here, you know?
[178:06.18]I just was up there.
[178:06.85]What am I doing here?
[178:08.33]What's going on?
[178:09.05]What's happening?
[178:12.27]What is happening?
[178:18.05]Um... Um... Um... Um... Oh yeah.
[178:30.48]The illusion place.
[178:35.02]The shield.
[178:37.37]Put on the shield.
[178:38.27]What do you put on the shield?
[178:41.23]This thing?
[178:41.59]I'm going to put this shield on.
[178:45.21]Oh, well, would you look at that?
[178:50.51]Not fat rolling and I get some HP revival.
[178:55.83]Hey.
[178:59.65]I forgot this was here.
[179:09.01]I'm getting cheesed through the fucking wall is what's happening.
[179:23.34]I gotta keep going.
[179:24.26]I gotta get out of here.
[179:27.20]Just get me out of here.
[179:32.14]You have nothing?
[179:32.72]Wait, I can buy.
[179:33.40]Oh.
[179:37.97]This is just an endless cycle.
[179:41.01]Where I just buy shit from you over and over again.
[179:43.81]I'm gonna keep refilling you.
[179:48.58]Heal with the infinite regen shield.
[179:50.48]What are you talking about?
[179:52.86]I didn't know... Somebody could have just jumped across and got me.
[179:55.71]And killed me in one hit.
[180:06.36]Okay.
[180:07.40]Time to sit up.
[180:14.66]This time I'm not going to aggro this.
[180:16.46]There is a ladder over here that I'm going to climb.
[180:19.77]And we're going to climb it right now.
[180:25.99]You could climb this a little faster.
[180:29.31]It would make me happy if you did.
[180:31.99]Anyone behind me?
[180:33.85]No.
[180:34.39]Watch out.
[180:36.91]Easy, easy, easy.
[180:39.79]Half moon grass.
[180:40.83]Good.
[180:41.43]Why do I hear something?
[180:42.45]What do I hear?
[180:43.09]I hear something.
[180:44.89]It's that guy dashing around.
[180:45.89]Okay, keep going.
[180:46.55]A lot of random items.
[180:54.90]So I have a lot of these now, so I should be okay eventually.
[181:00.86]Don't pick that up yet.
[181:01.84]I'm scared.
[181:03.67]It's so far on this hill.
[181:06.33]Ugh.
[181:11.00]That's all that's up here?
[181:14.94]What?
[181:15.08]Shit.
[181:20.95]Can I go over that way?
[181:24.55]There he is.
[181:24.91]There's that piece of shit.
[181:27.87]I remember that guy.
[181:29.87]Who remembers that guy?
[181:34.07]That's it, right?
[181:34.73]Nothing else?
[181:38.67]I did it.
[181:41.69]Neosporin will heal you faster than this.
[181:48.25]Snipe him?
[181:51.37]I could do that.
[181:53.63]Do I have enough arrows?
[181:55.67]To just sit there and cheeseball that guy?
[182:01.67]Nah, I'm gonna cheeseball him.
[182:05.24]Alright, let's get him.
[182:05.74]Let me like put the fucking...
[182:09.53]Alright, what do I got?
[182:11.07]I got like a bow, right?
[182:12.51]Compound, short bow, compound, long bow.
[182:14.97]Okay, I can put this one on.
[182:22.98]Light arrow?
[182:24.12]All I have is like light arrows.
[182:25.76]I don't even know how to shoot the bow in this game.
[182:30.50]Is it R3?
[182:30.88]There we go, okay.
[182:41.32]27.
[182:41.34]3.
[182:41.54]Oh, it's not even going in.
[182:59.75]Yeah.
[183:02.13]Let's back up.
[183:05.01]And he's... He's gone.
[183:09.31]Ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[183:16.06]Well... He had a determined look on his face.
[183:22.34]Has he come up this way?
[183:31.42]I missed.
[183:31.82]Oops.
[183:36.78]Yeah, he's right there.
[183:39.30]He didn't go very far, did he?
[183:42.44]What?
[183:42.60]What?
[183:46.20]What in the fucking hell are you doing?
[183:49.64]He's not gonna be behind me.
[183:50.56]You can't run that far.
[183:58.10]Two?
[183:58.88]I got it right in the ear.
[184:02.74]Oh, there we go.
[184:04.38]I'm coming to get you!
[184:05.34]No, I'm not.
[184:14.00]I'm kinda getting bored.
[184:18.27]That didn't hit him, apparently.
[184:27.30]Get me out of this.
[184:32.98]He's going to come back.
[184:33.74]I will.
[184:37.72]I ain't sitting here for this.
[184:38.86]I ain't going to fucking sit around and do that shit.
[184:41.20]Sorry, guys.
[184:43.30]Some things I'll do, some things I won't do.
[184:48.00]That's one of the things that I'm not willing to do.
[184:49.84]I'm going to keep progressing.
[184:54.93]Although he's not there.
[184:56.95]Which is sort of concerning me.
[184:58.99]Did I piss him off too much?
[185:03.20]I may have.
[185:03.60]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[185:16.11]I can go this way.
[185:18.78]What's over there?
[185:21.62]A little hall?
[185:27.26]Alright, I gotta go back.
[185:30.86]Down this way.
[185:31.68]And then that way, right?
[185:36.20]I don't fucking remember.
[185:43.50]I gotta go kill the demon soul.
[185:46.36]I'm trying.
[185:47.98]That's the plan.
[185:52.89]Just skip mobs, actually.
[185:54.33]Which way am I supposed to go, though?
[185:56.53]Am I supposed to go down here?
[186:01.08]I don't know.
[186:07.54]Okay.
[186:15.64]I think I'm supposed to go up here.
[186:20.34]No, no, wait a minute.
[186:21.74]This is down by that king guy.
[186:23.26]I don't want to go this way.
[186:24.40]Do I have to go this way?
[186:25.70]Down through my body.
[186:42.34]No, I'm not fighting that guy.
[186:43.84]He's not even there.
[186:48.25]Is there like a door I can go in over here somewhere?
[186:51.85]There's this big scary guy, but I don't want to fight that guy.
[186:58.44]I have to go this way?
[186:59.36]I have to go kill the king?
[187:04.32]I wasn't paying attention.
[187:06.08]I think I have to go in there and drop down.
[187:11.15]I don't think the guy's even here anymore.
[187:19.63]I don't think he's here.
[187:31.63]Is he here?
[187:34.63]He's not here.
[187:35.26]Oh yeah, he is.
[187:37.56]How much health does he have?
[187:38.32]He's at full health.
[187:40.80]Maybe I can make him fall off the edge, right?
[187:43.90]I'm gonna run by him.
[187:46.10]Can I kick him?
[187:46.64]Can I push him off the edge?
[187:52.99]Like, I could do without the fucking spears being rained down on me every one second.
[187:58.10]You know, that'd be great.
[188:09.14]There's two kings.
[188:11.48]Wait, I think this is just a regular enemy.
[188:13.56]This is just a regular... Oh boy, I'm panicking.
[188:16.06]Don't panic.
[188:17.24]I'm gonna get locked in with this king.
[188:19.80]Oh boy.
[188:21.85]It's just an enemy.
[188:22.85]It's just an enemy.
[188:23.65]Go in the fog gate.
[188:26.65]They aren't kings.
[188:27.61]They aren't kings after all.
[188:30.33]It's just regular enemies.
[188:32.59]How hard are they?
[188:37.30]Not too bad, but when you have to fight fucking three of them, that's when it begins to be an issue.
[188:41.76]What is this?
[188:46.02]I gotta get, I gotta, okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[188:50.63]He's not, okay, they won't be able to make it over here.
[188:53.15]That's like too hard of a jump.
[188:57.57]Grave robber ring?
[189:00.09]Oh, you serious?
[189:05.25]Get out of here.
[189:10.73]I don't care if you call me a cheese ball.
[189:12.09]I'm staying here.
[189:15.61]Go ahead.
[189:16.35]Call me the ultimate cheese master.
[189:19.05]I could fucking care less.
[189:29.79]I thought I was gonna get shot by the fucking man of manatee rays.
[189:34.86]Oh God I'm sitting there like anticipating the fucking spear to hit me and These areas are all so fucking hard Holy shit, man
[189:54.99]Every one of these areas has been, like, un-fucking-bearable.
[190:02.00]No wonder this is the original.
[190:03.20]I should just run by at this point.
[190:14.71]Like, honest to God.
[190:23.46]It's just like a fucking waste of time.
[190:27.07]And I know these are like the stupid wheel skeletons, and it's gonna be like, and I'm going the wrong way.
[190:33.95]That's how you do it.
[190:34.96]That's the strategy.
[190:35.62]I was gonna say, you get them like hit by their own... I don't know why I continue to do that.
[190:41.40]It just takes so long for this motherfucker to swing his sword, it makes me want to throw up blood in my mouth.
[190:49.54]These shit-stained enemies take, like, three full seconds to swing their fucking swords.
[190:53.96]And it makes me want to bury my head in the sand.
[190:56.86]And suffocate myself.
[191:02.16]There's gonna be one right here.
[191:03.44]And then you get, like, wedged into the fucking wall.
[191:07.93]Here I come!
[191:16.69]What just happened?
[191:25.98]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[191:29.64]Yeah.
[191:36.36]Yeah.
[191:37.55]And they come.
[191:39.05]And I even knew it was gonna happen and I'm stuck here.
[191:40.59]There's nowhere to go.
[191:44.79]I just can't move.
[191:45.81]I fucking... You wanna go into a tiny fight?
[191:51.15]You don't even wanna complain.
[191:52.09]It's fucking stupid.
[192:03.38]Should I just go fight the fat guy in the front?
[192:17.88]I could just run by the- The last time I tried to run by the giant, it didn't work.
[192:29.79]Yeah, yeah, shoot me with your fucking arrow.
[192:31.29]Be a dick.
[192:38.32]Fight the Vanguard.
[192:41.83]God, I want to shove a shit sandwich down this guy's throat.
[192:46.78]This is bad.
[192:47.62]I've already fucked this up royally.
[193:03.89]Like, I want to shove... I want to shit in between two pieces of bread.
[193:07.31]And just mush it into this guy's face.
[193:13.79]Can I go down the well?
[193:20.52]Come on.
[193:20.88]Break all this stuff and let me go by you.
[193:22.00]No, I think I'm going to get stuck right there.
[193:29.15]Okay, goodbye.
[193:38.99]So where does that even end up?
[193:39.79]I don't even know where I end up here.
[193:40.79]Alright, I gotta watch out.
[193:56.21]Like, do they have... Do you have to have these fucking guys, these stupid guys in the air?
[194:00.66]Do you have to have them here?
[194:03.14]What purpose do they serve other than to make somebody want to rip their hair out with a fucking handsaw?
[194:09.92]That's all they're here for.
[194:10.74]We're gonna have these rays just fly around in the air and just rain bullets down every, like, eight seconds.
[194:19.33]I mean, there's no purpose for them.
[194:20.67]We just want to make you... We just want to make you fucking cry.
[194:23.37]That's all we care about.
[194:24.19]Have you cried yet?
[194:25.48]I just forgot that was there.
[194:50.23]They put all this shit everywhere, because they know you're gonna forget about it, and you're gonna walk over it and die.
[194:55.87]It's just- that's just the- they're all fucking- they all like- all these guys, all these FromSoftware guys, I wouldn't be surprised, alright?
[195:02.61]I would not be surprised at all, if these guys all like fucking burn each other with cigars, like in fucking their spare time.
[195:10.40]They probably develop these games, and then they have a cigar burn your skin party.
[195:16.48]These like sadomasochist fucking psychos.
[195:21.98]That was really fun.
[195:24.12]You want to burn my skin with cigars?
[195:29.78]That's what we do here.
[195:37.03]I'm fucked.
[195:39.41]I'm so fucked.
[195:42.93]You can't fight two of these guys.
[195:44.31]Let alone three guys.
[195:47.62]Shooting the fucking bow and arrow.
[195:50.88]Get the fuck away from me!
[196:02.87]Sounds like a great Thursday afternoon.
[196:14.00]They all go to a swamp and they drink poison.
[196:18.17]And they all like jerk off in a circle, whatever the fuck they do.
[196:27.38]Whatever it is those guys do.
[196:39.92]Out of the way.
[196:44.21]Officially tilted.
[196:45.99]I was tilted 20 minutes ago.
[196:52.73]I thought this was a PG stream, but sometimes we have rated R shit.
[196:59.83]Fucking god, I... It's already excruciating enough without the fucking manta rays.
[197:07.65]Get the fuck away from me.
[197:09.09]Why are you here?
[197:10.27]You serve no purpose.
[197:12.58]Ow.
[197:13.48]Alright, I'm shutting up, and I'm fucking gonna get through this.
[197:20.34]Oh my fucking god, a manta ray!
[197:23.66]The goddamn manta ray is hitting me right now.
[197:30.65]I gotta go somewhere else.
[197:31.61]I fucking hate this area.
[197:33.63]This area sucks absolute donkey balls.
[197:36.13]This place sucks asshole.
[197:41.24]I would rather have a donkey shit in my mouth than play this area.
[197:49.01]Like, none of the areas so far have been this unfucking variable.
[197:52.55]Shit in my mouth.
[197:53.82]I would rather have that happen.
[197:59.88]I hate this place.
[198:06.85]Swing, you fucking idiot.
[198:08.13]Oh my god.
[198:24.79]Get over here.
[198:25.68]I'm fucking done messing around.
[198:26.90]I ain't playing around anymore.
[198:36.27]I am so unbearably angry right now.
[198:50.02]What the hell is this?
[198:50.96]Can I break this?
[198:51.93]I don't think that can be broken, considering he... Can I open that?
[198:57.93]Is that an openable door right behind him?
[198:59.69]I don't know.
[199:03.49]I feel like it is.
[199:04.28]Let's check.
[199:08.06]Nope!
[199:15.14]Okay.
[199:30.50]Go up here.
[199:40.14]You already know my opinion on these stupid fucking Manta Rays.
[199:42.61]I don't need to give you another opinion.
[199:52.05]I'm so angry and I'm so fucked up.
[199:53.95]Where am I supposed to even go?
[199:55.21]I forget.
[199:58.00]It's like down here somewhere.
[199:59.31]By the kings, right?
[200:05.69]Yeah.
[200:06.05]Just make sure you don't get hit by any random fucking spears that just go everywhere.
[200:10.71]Oh, man.
[200:18.04]It's like it's boiling my blood.
[200:21.64]My blood is on fire.
[200:23.62]Because of these things.
[200:24.40]Get the fuck away from me.
[200:28.12]Can I, like, drag these guys to the ground with, like, a hook or something?
[200:32.60]There has to be a way I can, like, ground these guys and fight them.
[200:39.63]I can understand if you had, like, one.
[200:40.75]But, like, five?
[200:42.19]How many are there?
[200:45.55]This one guy.
[200:46.27]This one guy is such a bad spot.
[200:50.37]You're, like, bad spot the enemy.
[200:52.90]Oh, dear.
[200:56.29]Get away from me.
[200:57.15]I'm not fighting him out here.
[200:59.10]Not a chance in hell.
[201:04.08]I would... I'm not... No way am I fighting you here.
[201:12.88]Okay.
[201:14.50]Easy.
[201:16.72]Easy, buddy.
[201:23.78]Shard of... I hear something.
[201:28.23]I don't know what I just heard.
[201:28.91]Oh, it was a bug.
[201:29.90]He's... You know, I'm going for survival right now.
[201:33.82]I'm not going for anything else.
[201:40.18]Just holding the shield up and... I can't climb it.
[201:50.39]Regenerator's ring.
[201:53.47]Okay, this is... This is all the way back around.
[201:56.07]Okay.
[201:56.51]Okay.
[201:58.63]Can I, like, knock a fucking wall down or something here?
[202:05.03]Can't, like, shortcut this?
[202:11.09]Wait.
[202:18.11]Become harder for Black Phantoms to detect.
[202:21.44]Recover HP a little at a time.
[202:27.89]Let me see here.
[202:28.99]What do I got?
[202:30.37]Cover HP.
[202:33.93]Item burden.
[202:37.19]Lose less HP from soul form.
[202:38.75]Alright, I'm gonna just do that.
[202:43.99]I have like a double regen on now.
[202:47.17]So I can't complain about like health anymore.
[202:49.41]I have double regen.
[203:09.74]How many swings do you have?
[203:13.24]Come on, swing again.
[203:22.63]I never use the Humanity.
[203:23.99]I really should start using, like, actually the Humanity, right?
[203:27.95]That'd be my best interest, wouldn't it?
[203:31.11]I'm always so afraid to use shit like that, though.
[203:34.69]Alright, now, there's this.
[203:37.48]So where do I go from here?
[203:40.86]I guess I can go over here.
[203:46.00]Yep, that's fine.
[203:46.73]Don't shoot the stupid thing.
[203:50.11]What is that?
[203:50.45]What's it?
[203:50.85]Well, wait.
[203:51.75]This is a boss down here?
[203:54.91]Wait, there's gotta be a shortcut that I'm missing.
[203:57.99]Where's the shortcut?
[204:02.21]Right?
[204:02.53]There has to be a shortcut.
[204:04.35]I refuse to believe that there's not.
[204:09.79]There has to be.
[204:13.20]There's no shortcut.
[204:39.36]Come on, you fucker.
[204:49.83]Yeah.
[204:53.23]I'm playing it cautious, because I don't know what the hell's behind that door.
[205:03.87]I'm barely hurting you, man.
[205:09.03]Like 26 damage a swing.
[205:10.49]18 damage.
[205:11.47]This guy has a lot of resistance to my attacks.
[205:29.09]There's so much regen.
[205:30.71]I'm going to die in here.
[205:33.51]I'm going to die down here.
[205:38.82]There's no shortcut.
[205:40.84]I have to beat this guy.
[205:43.06]Whatever it is.
[205:44.54]Alright, fuck it.
[205:46.12]What's that saying that you millennials say?
[205:49.20]You've gotta go for it and there's only one chance to have it.
[205:55.57]A junk-ticator.
[206:00.33]A junk-ticator.
[206:01.53]A junk-ticator.
[206:07.26]Huh?
[206:08.43]Where is he?
[206:09.75]What is he?
[206:10.21]What the fuck is it?
[206:11.03]It's a giant tongue?
[206:12.63]It's a giant tongue.
[206:22.89]Where is he?
[206:25.07]Oh, god damn it!
[206:34.18]How do I hurt him?
[206:36.39]How do I hurt him?
[206:37.23]What do I do?
[206:51.48]He's got something sticking out of his leg.
[207:02.75]He's got like a thorn in his leg.
[207:10.73]Is that what I'm doing?
[207:14.89]Ow.
[207:26.62]Jeez, he's got a huge swing.
[207:34.20]That swing is so slow.
[207:35.54]Did I get him?
[207:38.95]Oh god.
[207:41.93]Okay.
[207:47.27]He's not dead.
[207:49.43]I, I, I, I... Now what?
[207:53.23]I hit him and I get this... Oh, okay.
[208:02.94]Just gonna...
[208:19.99]I think I win.
[208:26.61]Come on.
[208:28.89]Come on.
[208:33.81]Alright, this guy's pretty easy.
[208:38.01]This guy's really easy.
[208:40.87]Alright, let's shut up.
[208:41.67]Don't say that shit, because you're going to get killed, because you're an idiot.
[208:52.57]I'm the type of brainless asshole that will die to this guy.
[208:54.70]All right, I win.
[209:01.32]Okay.
[209:07.38]All right.
[209:16.30]The boss of this area, I hated this area, but that boss was honest to God.
[209:20.90]What the hell was that?
[209:32.79]That guy did one attack.
[209:34.84]It took like 12 seconds for me to figure out what to do.
[209:36.88]Alright.
[209:42.08]Swollen Demon Soul.
[209:44.30]Game's fun.
[209:44.90]I like this game.
[209:47.61]It's a good game.
[209:49.07]Having a fun time.
[209:54.89]Just checking.
[209:55.51]Just checking.
[209:56.15]Just looking.
[209:58.81]There was another level here.
[210:05.95]You know, there could be an... See?
[210:07.33]This is why you always check to find the Pac-Man balls.
[210:12.34]Anything else?
[210:12.78]I think I got it all.
[210:20.58]Yes, I did.
[210:25.87]Okay.
[210:26.37]Time to go down.
[210:33.19]And just... This fall's not going to kill me, right?
[210:37.72]Let's go level up.
[210:43.43]The real boss was the friends you made along the way.
[210:50.85]He has a really good boss weapon.
[210:52.23]Let's do one in vitality.
[210:55.35]Another one in strength.
[210:56.25]Let's do another one in vitality.
[210:59.41]Can I continue this?
[211:00.13]No.
[211:00.25]What stones do I need?
[211:20.61]the claymore I don't know if I picked them I can tell you goodbye um just a shitload actually I got a lot of the adjuncticator boss weapon is a really good strength weapon really let me break I have a lot of these so let me just smash these up see what I can do with them
[212:01.94]And storied soldier's stone.
[212:05.54]Let's start breaking some eggs.
[212:15.70]I need the club.
[212:28.68]Alright.
[212:29.70]Let's store some stuff.
[212:32.10]Hmm.
[212:38.46]Secret dagger, like baby nail, all this stuff.
[212:42.44]Is this a dex weapon anyways?
[212:43.72]A shoto?
[212:47.90]Yeah.
[212:50.28]Winged spear, yep.
[212:51.78]Of course it is.
[212:52.66]I'm gonna just keep the bow.
[212:54.86]All these catalysts can get out of here.
[212:57.08]Spike shield or kite shield?
[213:00.08]Sky shield.
[213:01.68]No.
[213:02.36]Neither.
[213:02.86]None.
[213:04.59]Keep the bow.
[213:05.01]Get rid of the bolts.
[213:07.85]Get rid of this MP ring.
[213:18.99]What about these, like, stones?
[213:25.65]So what about the lead?
[213:26.63]What about these other ones?
[213:27.57]The doll demon and the lead demon.
[213:28.73]Should I get rid of these?
[213:35.79]You have a heart of gold.
[213:41.00]I gotta catch up on bits here, too.
[213:44.80]This is probably the end of the stream.
[213:45.88]Oh, no, not yet.
[213:47.76]Not yet.
[213:53.90]I can level up again.
[213:55.32]Let's go do one more into strength.
[213:58.18]Oh, he's here.
[214:03.24]One more interest- 24.
[214:03.90]Talk to this guy.
[214:04.68]He's in town now.
[214:05.24]I'll go for, like, another 30 minutes.
[214:06.34]Check out, like, the next area.
[214:08.63]Yeah, I'm not streaming tomorrow, so I want to go for at least, like, four hours.
[214:32.67]I refuse to believe that this is what father wished for our great land.
[214:36.49]Mm-hmm.
[214:38.85]Well, what else do you have?
[214:41.58]Here in Boletaria, we speak of the legend of the two swords and the last hero.
[214:45.76]The two swords are Demon Brandt and Soul Brandt.
[214:48.60]Gonna get those sooner or later.
[214:49.64]One sword banishes that which befouls man.
[214:51.78]The last hero is King Doran is the everlasting one.
[214:56.01]But in the dark state of our land, legends are all we can depend upon.
[215:02.34]Okay.
[215:03.82]Less life story, more useful items.
[215:06.46]Well, thanks for your... I expended your dialogue.
[215:11.25]That's great.
[215:11.61]Let's buy a bunch of grass.
[215:20.01]What do you got?
[215:23.44]Okay.
[215:24.02]Okay.
[215:27.42]Cool.
[215:28.56]So, what's next?
[215:31.40]I could do 1, 2, the boss.
[215:33.76]I could try the boss at 1, 2.
[215:37.93]I could go back, like, there was a spot.
[215:40.01]Go back to 1, 1.
[215:44.49]I got 2, 2 available, and I have 5, 1 available.
[215:47.17]Let's just check out 2, 2.
[215:58.43]Either the 1-2 boss or Poison Land.
[216:03.11]Yeah, maybe.
[216:06.06]I have not beat the Tower Knight.
[216:09.84]Don't ever do 5-1.
[216:13.40]Don't ever do 5-1.
[216:20.48]Well, I guess there's a bug over here.
[216:23.89]Have I killed that yet?
[216:26.17]No.
[216:26.35]Let's go right for it.
[216:29.26]Even if it gets me killed.
[216:34.64]Come on, die.
[216:36.42]Die.
[216:38.70]Oh, lord.
[216:39.82]Okay, I got... Whatever it is, I got it.
[216:41.11]So, I'm good.
[216:44.85]Oh, that spread.
[216:46.49]Look at that spread.
[216:52.67]Oh, a guy behind me.
[216:58.30]I wish these guys dropped little souls.
[217:00.36]And I wish I wouldn't get hit by a guy's pickaxe that goes five miles per hour.
[217:05.98]Iron knuckles.
[217:06.62]I already have those.
[217:09.24]Large chunk.
[217:10.06]Good.
[217:12.41]Very nice.
[217:16.45]Ah, what am I doing?
[217:18.75]Stop fucking doing that.
[217:20.01]That's just out of habit that I'm, like, healing.
[217:23.95]I don't need to heal.
[217:40.40]I love doing that.
[217:41.16]It's so much fun.
[217:48.58]Yeah.
[217:50.06]Doesn't even matter.
[217:53.30]I'm just gonna heal the whole thing anyway.
[217:59.11]That was a- I accidentally hit the button.
[218:01.41]Didn't see what it was.
[218:06.85]I'm on autopilot?
[218:07.87]I was.
[218:09.83]This is good, though.
[218:10.53]I'm never taking this shit off.
[218:12.31]I will keep this stuff on to the end of the game.
[218:13.89]I hear something.
[218:25.44]Can this be broken?
[218:28.28]Well, I can drop down there and hopefully not die.
[218:32.10]Although, can I?
[218:34.40]I'm not entirely sure I can.
[218:43.19]I can now.
[218:48.53]Can I?
[218:49.87]I can't even.
[218:50.71]I can't see.
[218:51.53]I can't.
[218:57.42]I can't see.
[218:58.04]I don't know.
[218:59.10]Let's check the other way first.
[219:11.99]Can I squash all these bugs?
[219:14.96]There's another way to go.
[219:15.66]Let me see what it is.
[219:17.34]Before I commit to anything over there.
[219:20.60]Is it this way or that way?
[219:29.03]Alright, well that explodes.
[219:31.09]Thanks for the warning, game.
[219:34.77]Let's just move this way.
[219:36.97]Something's gonna fly down.
[219:38.17]Something's gonna push it and it's gonna explode on me.
[219:45.34]Yep, there it is.
[219:45.94]It's gonna blow.
[219:47.42]Just let it go by you.
[219:54.07]Okay.
[219:56.25]I was under the assumption it was gonna keep going, but I'm alright with that.
[219:59.21]Oh, it's one of these guys.
[220:17.48]Moon grass, good.
[220:23.31]This regen actually is pretty ridiculous though.
[220:26.79]It appears to be immobile.
[220:32.39]This regen is carrying me right now.
[220:35.11]As hard as you could carry somebody.
[220:36.41]There's an elevator there.
[220:46.27]Weird, like, marshmallow fluff down here.
[220:47.91]This is not a great place to fight anybody.
[221:02.80]I hit the ceiling.
[221:03.80]Shit.
[221:10.32]Whoops.
[221:16.60]Something's going to be behind one of these.
[221:17.80]After I break... You know, I've never heard of Ghostbusters.
[221:22.62]This reminds me of when they're breaking the gargoyle.
[221:25.20]And everyone turns into, like, the Stay Pump Marshmallow Men and Marshmallow People and shit.
[221:28.98]It's freaking me out.
[221:32.70]I do like this area, though.
[221:33.60]It's interesting looking.
[221:38.34]Give me one... One...
[221:49.47]Ah!
[222:25.57]You guys should think I was gonna be unmuted anytime soon.
[222:30.71]Just like a ga- How do I kill them?
[222:32.43]I think I figured out how to kill them.
[222:33.45]Okay, I did.
[222:35.13]Where am I?
[222:36.63]I don't know where the fuck I am.
[222:40.19]VOD's gonna get muted now.
[222:41.82]Alright, let me concentrate.
[222:42.82]I have to like hit this guy in the face.
[222:48.32]And he goes, wow!
[222:51.55]How did I do it last time?
[222:52.51]Didn't I just do this once and he fucking died?
[222:57.91]Can the camera fucking please not be in the stupidest place possible?
[223:02.19]What?
[223:06.30]Why am I not hurting him anymore?
[223:16.78]Did he break my weapon?
[223:25.31]Fuck that stupid enemy.
[223:26.53]Like, I'm gonna keep going.
[223:27.45]Because I can't even hurt him.
[223:28.15]I have to be muted to do damage, apparently.
[223:34.09]I gotta turn my microphone off to hurt this guy.
[223:41.02]What is down here?
[223:42.92]This is... Wow, okay.
[223:47.97]He has a lot of defense.
[223:53.89]This is not going to be well.
[223:54.67]I'm going to go backwards and he's going to hit me backwards.
[223:59.13]244 damage.
[223:59.49]What?
[224:00.94]I hit that guy right in the face.
[224:06.00]Cookie, come here.
[224:08.04]Come here, Cookie.
[224:08.64]Come here, come here, come here.
[224:09.34]Got him.
[224:12.75]Don't go down that well.
[224:14.05]Don't fall down.
[224:16.47]Don't you go down!
[224:17.61]You stupid dog!
[224:23.79]It's right there.
[224:24.89]It's down there.
[224:25.39]He died.
[224:29.75]Fuck me.
[224:38.38]I obviously have to drop down somewhere, right?
[224:46.24]There's a spot right there.
[224:55.21]Where is it?
[224:56.47]Oh god, this is gonna end very poorly.
[225:01.67]Okay, I'm safe.
[225:04.89]Shard of Greystone.
[225:08.55]Let's go this way now.
[225:12.81]Easy.
[225:13.49]It's nice and long, I can get it.
[225:19.32]Right here.
[225:21.76]A chunk of Greystone.
[225:25.85]Is it still safe?
[225:26.95]Is it safe?
[225:27.57]It is.
[225:30.47]I can do crushing now.
[225:38.08]A great axe.
[225:41.58]What is that thing?
[225:42.44]Is that guy waving at me?
[225:55.29]Is that an NPC?
[226:00.57]He's just like, hi!
[226:01.39]Uh, I don't know what these enemies do, so we're gonna do shield man.
[226:09.42]And then of course they have like 10,000 defense.
[226:12.58]What do you do?
[226:13.62]Do you roll over on your stomach or something?
[226:15.72]Talk to like, parry you?
[226:17.54]I'm like cracking a coconut!
[226:27.98]Am I gonna get some, like, meat inside there?
[226:29.54]Some, like, white flesh?
[226:35.02]Oh, my.
[226:35.56]I'm gonna fucking die.
[226:37.26]Please.
[226:37.60]These guys get a lot of souls.
[226:41.31]Holy shit.
[226:43.83]That was 260 souls.
[226:44.23]It's worth it.
[226:57.28]Is that the mom?
[226:58.10]Oh, there's a mommy right there.
[226:59.12]There's a mother.
[227:00.16]Alright, there's a mother.
[227:04.00]Just don't get too close to the mother.
[227:05.56]Are you just a bigger version of that one?
[227:10.56]I don't know.
[227:11.30]Oh boy.
[227:13.25]Wish I had magic, right guys?
[227:39.66]I kind of need to know how many souls I get for killing that one.
[227:42.11]Because you get a lot for killing these guys.
[227:48.35]I could just farm here, man.
[227:57.81]I will regen all the damage this guy does.
[228:00.32]In the ass?
[228:04.22]Like in the back or something?
[228:16.05]I'm sorry for the really boring part right now, guys.
[228:19.01]This is such a lame fight.
[228:28.11]I can't hit him anywhere else, huh?
[228:34.64]Watch, this guy's going to get like a thousand souls.
[228:39.24]I got it.
[228:39.74]Is he running away?
[228:40.32]Don't run away.
[228:44.73]It only makes it stronger.
[228:45.99]We're almost there.
[228:49.67]Not much longer.
[228:50.71]Trust me.
[228:53.04]He's trying to get away.
[228:53.82]He knows he's dead.
[228:54.52]I can get, like, a thousand souls.
[228:59.42]Easy.
[228:59.60]Alright, he's dead.
[229:03.30]What do I get?
[229:05.08]That looks like an explosion to me, Mom!
[229:19.41]Okay, well, now I know what those guys do.
[229:24.27]Is that thing alive?
[229:26.27]No.
[229:33.55]It's alright.
[229:34.73]I like these enemies.
[229:35.53]I like this area.
[229:38.51]I don't hate this place.
[229:39.61]Except I might hate this place if that guy starts attacking me.
[229:41.92]It's an NPC.
[229:48.04]What does he say?
[229:51.44]No, it's an NPC.
[229:53.49]Oh, you're not mad like the rest, are you?
[229:56.67]Yeah, I'm gonna tell you something to do and you're gonna die!
[229:58.65]What jolly traveling companions are we?
[230:01.86]This guy's a spider in Bloodborne.
[230:03.34]I know he's a fucking sphiend.
[230:04.72]Don't worry.
[230:06.44]Oh, see that treasure over there?
[230:10.00]Go on and take it.
[230:12.32]My gift to you, just to show that we're friends.
[230:17.65]I'm glad to meet you.
[230:19.57]These soul-starved imbeciles will drive you mad.
[230:23.34]He has the same shield.
[230:26.28]Okay, well I know I'm gonna go down there and something bad's gonna happen.
[230:29.72]He's gonna drop like a cleaver on me.
[230:34.07]You never trust Patches.
[230:35.11]Like, this is the first time they put him in the game.
[230:41.77]No, sorry dude.
[230:43.66]I'm not gonna do that.
[230:53.81]Do I have anything else in my inventory that will hurt this guy more?
[231:02.16]Is it going to do more damage to him?
[231:04.86]No, not even close.
[231:06.36]It does less.
[231:10.76]The club does less damage.
[231:13.88]How about like a greataxe?
[231:21.69]No.
[231:26.25]Put on the Falchion.
[231:29.12]I don't have it in my inventory.
[231:33.26]He gives 700 souls, though.
[231:35.38]He has to die, right?
[231:42.41]I deposited it.
[231:46.53]Do I have any stories I can tell you?
[231:47.91]I don't know.
[231:49.65]I don't think I have any stories.
[231:56.49]Get the fuck out of here.
[232:03.80]Where did that stupid little taco die?
[232:06.68]Whatever his name was.
[232:07.58]The little taco guy.
[232:10.28]That guy looks like a taco.
[232:16.35]I don't think it died over here.
[232:17.23]Yeah, there it is.
[232:19.77]There it is.
[232:20.13]There's the taco.
[232:25.82]Chunk of sharp stone.
[232:26.78]Getting a lot of good stuff here.
[232:28.46]And the frame rate is not doing so well.
[232:32.63]This is bad.
[232:33.97]Anything else I can do up here?
[232:43.36]I just have to go down, down, down.
[232:49.50]Blight town.
[232:50.06]That's what it reminds me of.
[232:55.40]Yeah, that absolutely was single digits.
[232:57.19]It was for sure.
[232:58.07]You are right on that one.
[233:08.47]I think I have to kill this guy.
[233:10.13]Yeah, this guy has to die.
[233:11.21]I can't go down any further.
[233:12.85]We have to sit here and I have to munch this guy's legs off.
[233:17.11]Oh, god damn it.
[233:17.91]Alright, well, I have to kill this guy.
[233:20.25]It's either that or go through patches like Funhaus.
[233:22.85]I'm not doing that.
[233:24.73]I'll tell you a story or something.
[233:31.60]One day... No, hold on a minute.
[233:34.48]I'm going to do this right.
[233:36.90]Give me a sec.
[233:45.02]Okay, hold on.
[233:49.19]We're going to get a story here.
[233:51.75]This is a story.
[233:52.85]I'm not going to tell it, but I'll be here and we'll be listening to it.
[233:57.05]This is called The Boy Who Loved Chocolate.
[234:00.11]A children's story.
[234:01.23]Okay, let's see.
[234:08.98]Okay, where is it?
[234:11.90]Okay, let's hear it.
[234:13.58]The Boy Who Loved...
[234:24.50]There was a boy who lived in a small village His name was Thomas The people in Thomas's village were very friendly and they were ready to help each other at a moment's notice Whether it was getting some water from the river feeding the animals
[234:51.08]Or even repairing a house.
[234:55.48]Thomas had grown up in this village.
[234:59.47]And it was all he knew.
[235:01.77]This story is ten minutes long.
[235:07.39]He had many friends.
[235:09.97]And he had a good life there.
[235:13.41]He also had animal friends like Calvin the cat and Mozart the mouse.
[235:21.84]Thomas, Calvin, and Mozart played a lot together and they especially loved to sing new songs that they had created out of their own imaginations.
[235:37.89]Everyone in the village loved how Thomas was full of creativity and imagination.
[235:45.53]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[235:46.77]There was only one thing that bothered Thomas.
[235:52.47]Something his parents could not quite explain to him.
[235:56.15]Oh my god, I can't wait.
[235:57.49]And everyone in the village had warned him about.
[236:00.65]The danger of eating chocolate.
[236:06.91]Why would that be a danger?
[236:08.01]Although Thomas' mom loved to cook, she was always very careful and paid close attention to remind Thomas that chocolate was a dangerous ingredient and should never be used.
[236:23.02]Should I kill him?
[236:23.98]Should I kill him?
[236:25.96]He's a bad guy, right?
[236:26.72]I should fucking smash him, right?
[236:28.20]To be tasted or even thought about.
[236:33.00]From as far back as Thomas could remember, he had always been told, Don't eat chocolate.
[236:41.02]It will make your tummy hurt.
[236:44.04]It will cause you to get sick.
[236:46.53]We're going to go to the last 30 seconds.
[236:48.51]Let's see what happens.
[236:51.49]Now Thomas and all of the people and animals of his village enjoy chocolate with no fear.
[237:01.40]Okay, good story.
[237:02.28]That was fun.
[237:05.24]Let's go back to- Wait!
[237:07.15]Easy!
[237:09.15]Stop it!
[237:09.99]Why is this happening?
[237:16.81]No, fear the chocolate.
[237:18.80]Ayayay.
[237:22.82]I accidentally was pressing R to- He's staring.
[237:25.52]Alright, so now I can get this, right?
[237:29.58]The bug is gone.
[237:30.32]He's not going to do anything fucked up to me, right?
[237:31.76]There's two ways to go.
[237:38.17]Shard of Dragonstone.
[237:40.71]Ring of Flame Resistance.
[237:43.29]And then the shit in there.
[237:45.74]He's going to pull a lever and fucking get me, right?
[237:50.42]He's going to do something.
[237:52.76]I don't know what he's going to do.
[237:53.68]He's going to do something fucking weird.
[238:05.51]Fucking club.
[238:06.35]Okay.
[238:06.67]Well, I just... Whatever.
[238:14.82]Patches, you look like a character I would make.
[238:16.46]He probably would have kicked the bug down to block me.
[238:21.26]Yeah.
[238:22.01]He's a real prick.
[238:28.01]Let's go back to Lake.

[244:11.04]I'm trying to hit this.
[244:11.70]I'm trying to hit the guy next to you.
[244:13.75]Oh my god.
[244:14.25]I'm trying to hit the guy next to you.
[244:17.05]Don't f- holy shi- thank god for the- thank god for the bumpers!
[244:20.39]Thank god for the bumpers at the bowling alley.
[244:26.30]If I didn't have those bumpers, I never would've got a spare.
[244:33.22]I know.
[244:41.01]Oh my god.
[244:44.79]Emergency.
[244:50.12]It was worth going this way because whatever this is.
[244:51.74]Chunk of hard stone.
[244:52.62]I'm getting a lot of these.
[244:53.48]What about down there?
[244:54.10]Okay, I can drop down there and be safe.
[244:58.71]I can also go up here.
[245:00.01]A couple of bees.
[245:02.25]These are no problem for me.
[245:09.67]You've seen me fight bees before on stream.
[245:11.39]Do you think it's a big deal?
[245:15.05]It is not.
[245:18.19]Come here.
[245:19.33]Can't carry would overburden you.
[245:21.23]Shit.
[245:26.67]God damn it.
[245:27.33]God damn it.
[245:32.85]Great at club.
[245:33.66]Like, just get rid of the club.
[245:34.66]I'm not going to use this thing.
[245:36.44]I'm going to drop it over here.
[245:43.66]Club.
[245:45.12]Drop it.
[245:49.37]Drop the knuckles.
[245:50.17]I'm not going to use these.
[245:51.85]The great axe.
[245:55.69]I could put on the other ring.
[245:59.97]Yeah, I'll put the other ring on.
[246:04.38]The burden ring instead of the... Okay, let's see.
[246:09.50]Maximum item burden and...
[246:18.29]I don't need the cling ring right now.
[246:22.50]I don't need the cling ring at the moment.
[246:24.30]Alright, so what is it down here?
[246:27.00]It's a shard.
[246:27.54]Alright.
[246:30.56]Let's keep going.
[246:34.61]Cling ring while in body.
[246:35.87]Yeah, I took it off.
[246:39.53]I need the club.
[246:41.45]Well, I probably can carry it now.
[246:42.95]Yeah, there we go.
[246:47.27]Alright, there was a little shortcut.
[246:49.29]There's patches.
[246:51.45]I almost called them pate.
[246:57.74]Move over this way.
[247:00.18]Go down.
[247:00.74]I guess I keep going down, down, down.
[247:07.88]I missed an item over here, but I'm not that concerned about it.
[247:10.63]You just scared me.
[247:12.57]I thought I was about to start swinging at that guy.
[247:21.32]He looked like a default zombie enemy.
[247:25.81]I hate when this is going on like that.
[247:37.14]I'm getting a lot of these shards.
[247:40.48]That looks like a boss.
[247:43.82]If I were a boss, I'd be in that room.
[247:46.68]I can tell you that right now.
[247:54.60]Fighting these guys with this lock on is not a good idea.
[247:56.74]Alright, well, did I... There's no shortcut then.
[248:09.06]Free time.
[248:14.03]Is there a shortcut that I missed?
[248:15.07]I guess this is not even a boss.
[248:30.51]Just fall.
[248:37.43]Is there like fire?
[248:38.97]Am I gonna do like fire resistance for this guy?
[248:49.56]I don't know.
[248:49.92]Should I just go in here?
[249:00.05]I'm assuming this guy is a fire person.
[249:02.51]So why don't I put on a fire thing?
[249:06.55]I need to put the stupid ring on.
[249:09.17]Resistance.
[249:12.50]Flame resistance.
[249:14.26]Okay.
[249:15.32]Sure thing.
[249:25.48]I'm going in.
[249:27.26]What's the worst that could happen?
[249:28.00]I lose everything?
[249:28.58]I mean, that is the worst thing that could happen, but you know, whatever.
[249:31.56]I mean, the worst thing that could happen is I just lose.
[249:51.58]So, it's not the boss yet.
[249:58.25]Not a boss.
[250:04.57]So you're telling me there's a chance.
[250:13.92]Two ways to go.
[250:18.12]Well, let's put the shield out.
[250:25.08]Is this fine?
[250:27.72]What is that?
[250:28.90]Oh, it's a big, it's a big beetle.
[250:32.96]I would, I would like kill this guy, but I'm not sitting here.
[250:35.34]We're not listening to another story.
[250:36.50]Alright, so there's just two ways to go for no reason.
[250:51.55]I guess, unless there's an illusion wall or something.
[250:57.31]Excuse me.
[250:59.21]Thank you.
[251:06.19]What is in the air right there?
[251:11.51]This just reminds me of Diablo 2.
[251:13.06]You guys remember the Diablo 2 tunnels?
[251:18.12]The maggot lair in Diablo 2?
[251:21.74]That's what this is.
[251:24.36]Can I pull him out?
[251:25.26]Come on.
[251:33.12]Move out of the way.
[251:39.22]Come on.
[251:40.76]I want to get the item that's behind you.
[251:42.73]Can I walk over his body?
[251:45.37]No, I can't.
[251:45.87]Come on.
[251:46.67]Pull him out.
[251:48.27]You only have to go a little bit further.
[251:52.81]Come on.
[251:55.47]No, I don't want to have to kill you.
[251:56.59]You just made it even worse.
[251:57.55]You just Winnie the Poohed this hole.
[251:59.57]Come on.
[252:03.16]He can't even come this way, can he?
[252:07.66]God damn it.
[252:09.76]Move.
[252:10.34]No, he's going backwards.
[252:11.46]Don't go backwards.
[252:12.28]Let me in there.
[252:15.68]Let me in.
[252:17.22]Look, there's a thing right there I can get.
[252:18.66]It's right there.
[252:20.86]Just wedge through him.
[252:22.50]Eventually the game will fucking break and I'll teleport behind him, right?
[252:25.02]You dickhead.
[252:29.04]Whatever, fine.
[252:40.24]Damn it.
[252:42.14]I don't like this place.
[252:50.77]Shit.
[252:55.09]Where did I just go?
[252:57.39]Am I behind him now?
[253:00.74]I'm very confused.
[253:04.42]What?
[253:05.30]Where am I?
[253:10.41]I went backwards somehow.
[253:12.56]Yeah, I did.
[253:14.02]God, fuck you.
[253:23.72]I don't want mazes.
[253:24.60]I don't want to play in the maze.
[253:31.61]Get me out of the maze!
[253:41.47]What?
[253:52.92]Oh, please.
[254:00.17]Get me out of here.
[254:01.05]I want to get out of this.
[254:02.33]Don't like this area.
[254:03.99]I liked the first part.
[254:05.01]I don't like the fucking tunnel maze.
[254:08.11]An opening.
[254:13.31]No, that's the boss right there, isn't it?
[254:17.73]Don't go there yet.
[254:27.32]Dragon longsword.
[254:35.45]Ayayay, what a mess to come back here, huh?
[254:40.91]I don't have the teleport staff.
[254:58.53]Shit.
[254:59.91]Uh...
[255:01.88]I can't go in there, can I?
[255:04.44]We're gonna put our feet in the water and see what happens.
[255:06.99]Okay, that hurts.
[255:10.59]That hurts too much.
[255:16.11]Here come the bees.
[255:23.10]Put on the regen thing.
[255:29.63]Where is it?
[255:35.49]I don't think I'm supposed to be over here.
[255:40.57]Just out-regen the orange water?
[255:42.53]I can't make it anywhere.
[255:43.41]There's nowhere for me to go.
[255:47.92]I probably can't do this yet.
[255:59.28]I don't know if I need to... Okay, well, I guess I'm going.
[256:04.61]Oh, shit.
[256:05.01]Bees.
[256:08.21]Like weeds and shit.
[256:09.53]Oh, no.
[256:10.95]I'm all in at this point.
[256:11.85]Oh, found it.
[256:14.51]Found something.
[256:18.71]I don't know what this is.
[256:19.45]So, take it slow.
[256:23.43]Unknown hero.
[256:24.01]So, this is just back where I was.
[256:25.41]Okay.
[256:27.78]Okay.
[256:39.60]So many.
[256:44.46]Another tunnel?
[256:45.46]Okay, there's another tunnel.
[256:47.58]Does this lead anywhere else?
[256:52.08]Oh, it's another bunch of fucking... Which door?
[256:55.03]Door number one?
[256:55.71]Door number two?
[256:56.25]Door number three?
[256:57.85]Door number three.
[257:03.61]This is like... Oh, boy.
[257:13.28]I don't know.
[257:15.43]Was there another door?
[257:16.89]No.
[257:25.74]Where am I going?
[257:29.06]Where am I going?
[257:32.46]Where the fuck am I?
[257:38.77]Huh?
[257:47.18]I can fall down.
[258:03.77]Wait a minute.
[258:04.57]Is that?
[258:09.97]You'll survive.
[258:10.67]The boss is down.
[258:11.85]I don't know what to do.
[258:15.63]Is that a ladder right there?
[258:21.10]This is not the shortcut.
[258:22.09]What are you talking about?
[258:22.87]There's nothing here.
[258:23.83]It's just like a... In Demon Slows, you don't take as much fall damage.
[258:28.05]I know, but still, that's like 5,000 feet, guys.
[258:31.25]I'm gonna die.
[258:36.92]I'm not doing that yet.
[258:37.86]There's two more doors to pick.
[258:42.70]That's a ladder back up.
[258:46.72]Let me just see what's down the other two.
[258:48.00]Look, I'm not going to get baited by chat to jump off of a cliff in a Demon's Souls, Dark Souls fucking From Software game.
[258:54.01]Alright, just give me some slack.
[258:58.51]Let me check the other two tunnels.
[259:01.51]Just so I know, just so I'm safe.
[259:07.68]Okay, let's go right up the middle.
[259:09.46]Door number two.
[259:16.28]Chunk of clear stone.
[259:19.28]And, okay, that's... I think that's where I was before.
[259:21.52]Because this guy is, like, that's blocking the path.
[259:24.59]Okay.
[259:28.55]So there's one more way to go.
[259:30.97]Down here.
[259:33.27]What is down here?
[259:36.57]Stone.
[259:37.63]Fuck.
[259:44.19]Do I have to jump down there?
[259:48.30]I don't actually have to do that, right?
[260:02.50]I'm so nervous right now.
[260:03.80]Does it not look like a thing I gotta knock down, like hit this?
[260:10.95]I see a ladder.
[260:19.75]I don't think this is gonna do anything.
[260:20.97]Okay, uh... I didn't fully explore the lava area.
[260:37.18]And the bushes!
[260:39.00]If I die, I'm gonna be really upset!
[260:40.56]I'm okay.
[260:48.43]I'm okay.
[260:51.93]Hey, wait a minute.
[260:53.03]No, don't.
[260:53.43]Not like this.
[260:54.17]Not like this.
[260:54.79]Not to a fucking worm.
[260:56.39]Not like this.
[260:58.17]Not gonna happen.
[260:59.08]Not like this.
[261:00.38]Just emergency!
[261:18.24]What is up here?
[261:24.51]It's a shortcut.
[261:25.27]This is a shortcut, no?
[261:30.79]But where's the... What?
[261:41.74]I know there's a doorway.
[261:42.98]I'm just checking to see what the hell is over here.
[261:51.20]Wrong way.
[261:52.08]I'm stressing out.
[261:53.99]I'm getting some high levels of stress right now.
[262:04.25]I've got like my cortisol levels are probably like times one.
[262:10.09]It doesn't sound very high.
[262:17.06]I don't know what to do.
[262:21.68]I have to... There's a lot of them exploring.
[262:25.74]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[262:26.48]There's an item right there.
[262:27.36]Hold on.
[262:30.54]These guys are probably causing me lots of anxiety.
[262:32.73]I gotta get rid of these guys.
[262:39.75]His midichlorian levels are through the roof.
[262:52.01]God.
[262:56.05]He's fucking midi-chlorian.
[262:59.69]I didn't hit him.
[263:00.35]Right in the face.
[263:06.87]Oh, would you please.
[263:08.99]Would you kindly.
[263:09.65]You know what I mean?
[263:11.90]Would you kindly.
[263:14.71]What was that video game in the 70s?
[263:26.08]I have a lot of these stars.
[263:29.88]These stars.
[263:31.00]Shards.
[263:31.64]Whatever the hell they are.
[263:33.34]Car parts.
[263:34.10]I have a lot of car parts.
[263:35.96]Alright.
[263:37.80]Now I can take a second and take a look at what the hell is going on here.
[263:40.93]There's a doorway here.
[263:45.20]Which leads to... Another... There's the boss.
[263:56.26]That's the boss.
[263:59.68]Let's go ahead and take a look over here.
[264:05.48]What's down this way?
[264:06.90]Anything else I can do?
[264:11.69]These guys gotta stop moving straight.
[264:15.85]Like, I get it.
[264:16.53]I get it.
[264:16.91]I get it.
[264:17.55]But, like, holy fuck, man.
[264:27.91]Oh, my fucking god.
[264:31.00]Can I not get by these guys?
[264:32.78]Can I keep doing this shit?
[264:38.18]I want that item more.
[264:50.35]Nope!
[264:52.03]Nope!
[264:52.31]Nope!
[264:54.85]Nope.
[264:56.77]Use a bow?
[265:00.45]I could use a bow.
[265:01.43]Hold on.
[265:01.79]Do I have enough arrows?
[265:09.76]I mean, I can't even see him That works I'm doing a lot of damage with this thing
[265:42.38]There we go.
[265:44.80]It's that easy.
[265:48.27]So what's the secret item?
[265:50.93]What were you guarding?
[265:53.85]Hands of God.
[265:56.93]And there's a way to go back here.
[265:59.01]Kinda.
[266:00.81]Sort of.
[266:01.07]I guess not.
[266:02.55]Those are the best weapons in the game?
[266:11.37]God hands.
[266:14.90]Worst weapon in the game.
[266:16.16]Let me just take a look what's up here.
[266:17.95]And then I'm... You know what?
[266:20.15]This might be like a next time.
[266:22.33]Like previously on the next Game of Thrones.
[266:24.43]You know what I mean?
[266:28.43]This could be one of those situations where I go back to town and it's like previously on the next Game of Thrones.
[266:33.21]Because this is absolutely the boss.
[266:39.85]So I need to find the best path to come back here.
[266:44.42]I have 7,000 souls.
[266:45.52]I can level up like twice.
[266:48.64]I will try.
[266:49.46]I'm gonna try this boss once.
[266:51.40]And see what happens.
[266:53.47]But I need to go find like the... Ow.
[266:56.33]Ow, ow, ow.
[266:57.45]Ow, my fucking... I'm so sorry.
[267:01.33]I'm so sorry, guys.
[267:02.13]That was fucking probably horrible for you.
[267:04.27]It was horrible for me.
[267:05.54]My like finger is like bleeding.
[267:08.28]I'm so sorry.
[267:17.73]I see you summoned a friendly phantom and one-shotted him.
[267:20.66]Well, I want to try to do most of the content alone.
[267:28.26]I can't get back.
[267:28.90]I'm stuck.
[267:30.20]There's nothing here.
[267:31.54]I can't, like, climb to the top.
[267:35.72]Let's see if I can get over there.
[267:39.10]An item that way.
[267:44.94]The game has no shortcuts?
[267:46.54]That's not entirely true.
[267:49.26]I feel like I've found a few already.
[267:53.94]So I can... Where can I drop?
[267:55.38]Right?
[267:56.12]I can't even tell.
[267:56.74]Right here?
[268:04.00]Wait, did that just bring me... No.
[268:08.78]That just brought me back to there.
[268:12.07]So there is no... I guess this is the only way back.
[268:14.91]This is a long way.
[268:19.97]This is a long way back.
[268:28.60]Is there, like, a homeward bone in this game?
[268:35.28]Let me go back to that, like, lava place.
[268:46.15]Stop stalling?
[268:46.99]What do you... What do you mean, stop stalling?
[268:50.78]You understand, this franchise is a series of stalling.
[268:56.48]This game was built on you stalling.
[269:00.54]To make sure you were ready.
[269:01.47]Now I can't get by this fucking guy.
[269:11.49]I can't keep going the other way.
[269:15.04]I mean, I could be a Psycho here.
[269:17.40]I could try it.
[269:18.62]I could try being a Psycho and do a lily pad hop.
[269:23.10]Is there anything over there I can do?
[269:25.26]Besides these random items.
[269:34.56]Might as well fight the boss.
[269:35.38]It's gonna take really long to get back to the bonfire.
[269:47.15]Well, alright, let's go fight him.
[269:49.63]Right, like, what's the worst that could happen?
[269:51.15]I lose 7,000 souls and, like, I lose my humanity.
[269:55.81]I'll just fight him.
[269:56.61]This is it.
[269:57.33]Last, this is the shot.
[269:58.37]Whatever happens, happens.
[269:59.21]Stream ends.
[270:02.07]I went the wrong way.
[270:03.43]Went the wrong way.
[270:04.61]Uh, because the fucking bug hall from Diablo 2, it's all the same thing.
[270:10.74]There's no difference.
[270:11.34]It's the same fucking place.
[270:12.56]Now, I don't even know where I am, though.
[270:15.10]I don't have a single goddamn clue.
[270:18.49]I may as well... You couldn't pay me a thousand dollars for me to tell you where I am.
[270:22.00]Alright, where the hell am I?
[270:28.71]Let's go.
[270:47.51]Where is it?
[270:48.99]Where is it?
[270:51.43]Where is it?
[270:59.15]Whoa!
[270:59.43]Alright, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, hold on.
[271:10.26]Let's go.
[271:10.72]Let's just fight him.
[271:11.44]I'm gonna one-shot this asshole.
[271:14.50]I'm gonna kill him in one fucking hit.
[271:24.37]Let's go, dickhead.
[271:25.07]Let's go, dickhead.
[271:34.36]You don't fucking scare me.
[271:37.00]Not much scares me anymore.
[271:41.08]Here we go.
[271:44.29]I'm gonna make this right.
[271:51.49]Let's get Crescent Moon, Half Moon, Late Moon, Full Moon, and... I don't know, like, fucking... Who cares?
[272:08.22]Let's go.
[272:12.82]I mean, I get Sticky White stuff, right?
[272:15.66]Still have one of those?
[272:16.28]Okay.
[272:22.03]I'm gonna go for it.
[272:22.83]Let's go for it.
[272:23.69]Let's go, let's just, let's lose.
[272:25.95]Here we go.
[272:27.31]I'm ready, I'm putting my fucking pants on for this one.
[272:28.79]I'm gonna beat him first try.
[272:35.89]What is it?
[272:47.76]The area's not that big.
[272:51.07]I thought he was gonna be like a huge demon or something.
[272:53.15]Well, he is a huge demon, of course he is.
[273:00.67]Oh lord, this guy.
[273:02.16]This guy looks like he's gonna be quite a handful.
[273:06.64]It's like Shao Kahn covered in flames.
[273:13.62]Great.
[273:14.07]Here we go.
[273:35.84]Come on.
[273:37.78]Come on Gwen.
[273:47.51]Come on Gwen.
[274:06.00]Come on!
[274:08.56]Fucking frog.
[274:10.32]Gotta be quiet.
[274:52.34]Easy, Quinn.
[275:23.49]Back it up.
[275:24.27]Bad spot.
[275:24.77]Bad spot.
[275:31.00]Back it up.
[275:31.42]Back it up, Gwyn.
[275:33.22]Back it up, Gwyn.
[275:56.59]Come on.
[275:57.66]I'm gonna fucking first try, you asshole.
[276:01.10]Bad spot.
[276:25.53]Oh, this is a bad fucking spot, easy.
[276:50.33]Whoo!
[277:11.82]Where are you fucker?
[277:45.85]And who says I can't fucking play video games, huh?
[277:50.49]Which one of you said it?
[277:51.57]Which one of you said it?
[277:54.50]Which one of you said I was fucking couldn't play fucking Dark Souls games?
[277:57.12]Who said it?
[277:59.74]First try.
[278:10.69]You can't.
[278:12.39]Hey!
[278:14.41]Somebody just wrote, I am fucking pissed.
[278:24.52]That was hard.
[278:26.52]That last phase there when he just blows up the fucking screen.
[278:29.20]That's the easiest boss in the game.
[278:37.81]Did I get my class D license back?
[278:44.80]Red Hot Demon Soul.
[278:48.70]Dude, this is the guy that beat Flamelurker first try on stream.
[278:54.19]Pre-patch, by the way.
[278:55.11]I'm not connected to the internet.
[279:03.97]I got a Class A license now.
[279:05.38]Alright, let's go back to the Nexus and chill.
[279:10.00]How dare you prove me wrong.
[279:14.03]I thought I was gonna lose that at the end.
[279:17.01]When I got stuck in that, like, bone prison?
[279:19.67]Oh man, that was not good.
[279:22.53]I got locked into that bone prison and I thought that was it.
[279:24.56]It was like, where the hell was I gonna go?
[279:34.74]A-list celeb streamer kills fire demon on first try.
[279:41.77]That is the hardest boss for real.
[279:47.39]See?
[279:50.43]Sometimes I can do something.
[279:53.21]When I really put my brain into it.
[280:01.81]I'm so fucking mad.
[280:03.07]Why are you mad?
[280:04.43]Why would you be mad that I did that?
[280:05.81]You should be happy.
[280:08.02]You should be happy that I beat the Dark Souls boss.
[280:13.90]Sometimes is the key word.
[280:14.94]That's right.
[280:16.89]All right.
[280:18.83]I'm going to cap it here.
[280:19.73]I'm going to enter.
[280:22.07]I mean, how else would I end this stream?
[280:24.21]I have to end it there.
[280:28.99]That boss has taken some people 10 plus hours to get past.
[280:42.54]And you got to end on a high note.
[280:43.58]You got to go out on top.
[280:47.06]Let's crush these souls.
[280:51.46]So, I'm not going to be streaming tomorrow.
[280:55.30]Tomorrow there's no stream.
[281:02.17]Doing some stuff in town tomorrow.
[281:08.15]I'm loving this game, though.
[281:09.19]But what am I doing?
[281:12.31]I really... I'm starting to get the swing of it.
[281:14.19]You know, at least one... You know, this is a five-hour stream.
[281:16.83]Like, 30 minutes worth complaining.
[281:19.19]That's pretty good.
[281:19.95]For, like, a game like this.
[281:20.89]For, like, a Souls game.
[281:26.15]When you've got, like, a 10 to 1, like, not complain versus complain while you're playing a game.
[281:31.29]Like, especially like this.
[281:32.25]I think you're doing alright.
[281:38.89]Let's break all these.
[281:45.03]30 minutes is conservative.
[281:48.39]It was more like one hour.
[281:49.67]No, it was like 22 minutes.
[281:54.14]You could have watched an entire episode of television worth of me complaining about demon souls.
[282:04.90]I got a lot of souls, though.
[282:06.64]This is big, big, big, big, big, big, big.
[282:08.64]I gotta be careful here.
[282:09.38]Alright, let me level 5,000.
[282:10.32]Nice.
[282:14.41]Let's go.
[282:14.87]Let's get the strength to 25.
[282:15.71]Endurance to 20.
[282:19.11]Should I put... Should I honest to God?
[282:24.07]Is there a reason for me right now to put any points into anything besides strength, endurance, and vitality?
[282:31.85]People were saying luck is a good thing, but is it though?
[282:34.84]Should I put a point into luck?
[282:40.36]Is that even worth doing at this point?
[282:42.20]Or no?
[282:45.88]No, just get strength to 40.
[282:46.72]Okay.
[282:51.80]That was a lot.
[282:52.38]That was 28.
[282:53.08]Okay, for one second I thought I just put those into something else.
[282:55.80]Alright, that's fine.
[282:59.19]Cool.
[283:00.75]I'm happy with that.
[283:03.43]Strength all the way.
[283:06.89]I can do crushing now, right?
[283:08.41]Let's get this.
[283:09.05]Let's go to Stonefang.
[283:10.07]Go to do the crushing.
[283:11.35]Level the weapon up.
[283:12.59]I actually can do it.
[283:18.64]Make the boss weapons.
[283:20.68]Hmm.
[283:26.98]But yeah, I will see you guys on... Hopefully Wednesday night.
[283:32.14]There's a lot of shit going on this week.
[283:33.98]But you're guaranteed you will see me on Thursday and Friday.
[283:39.61]Or maybe like Wednesday and Thursday.
[283:42.05]I'm all over the place.
[283:43.27]Because I think Friday is actually my birthday, so...
[283:47.22]This next, like, the last, like, ten days, like, including the next few days, like, five days or so, it's gonna be all over the place.
[283:55.55]I'm not gonna be on my schedule at all for the next, like, week and a half, just because of all this shit that's going on.
[284:09.61]So, you're gonna get random streams over the weekend, probably.
[284:12.86]You'll see one or two.
[284:13.54]Like, I don't know.
[284:14.92]I gotta figure it out.
[284:16.10]I'm just gonna be all over the place.
[284:18.54]How do I not know?
[284:19.72]Well, because... I'm going out tomorrow.
[284:24.12]And then... I have, like, a bunch of shit to do on Wednesday.
[284:27.55]And hopefully, like, I can, like, find some time to stream.
[284:31.15]And then... Thursday is gonna be normal.
[284:33.75]I'll be live, normal, like, regular time.
[284:36.35]Friday is my birthday.
[284:37.57]Okay.
[284:38.71]And, like, Saturday is also, like, my birthday, because, like, I'm going somewhere for my birthday.
[284:43.55]Sunday, I might have, like, a family thing for my birthday, so I don't know.
[284:46.57]I'll let you know.
[284:48.59]You will know.
[284:49.43]Alright, so let's see.
[284:53.18]Upgrade.
[284:55.66]Okay.
[284:57.06]Rushing Claymore is what I want, right?
[284:59.86]This is what we've decided is the thing that I should be doing.
[285:01.76]It's a three-day... Double birthday, baby!
[285:05.58]Okay.
[285:12.14]Just talk to him?
[285:13.42]I'm busy.
[285:14.60]I'm not here to chit-chat.
[285:15.98]Boarding weapons.
[285:16.97]Strengthening.
[285:17.71]Boars are trans.
[285:18.99]Okay.
[285:20.89]Demon soul?
[285:22.71]The demons are powerful spirits.
[285:25.49]Some can even bless weapons.
[285:27.63]But doing so requires a powerful flame.
[285:29.69]For the soul of a demon is an inferno of wrath.
[285:35.98]All right, we'll take it.
[285:36.64]That's what he's talking to him.
[285:37.78]All right, so, now what?
[285:38.35]What's his problem?
[286:07.57]Now you can bless your weapon with another Demon Soul.
[286:12.69]Give Red Hot Demon Soul.
[286:15.84]I feel like, uh... I feel like that's asking me something else.
[286:19.74]Alright, take the Red Hot Demon Soul, my friend!
[286:28.20]Reload?
[286:28.76]Wait, what do you mean reload?
[286:32.16]Wait, but maybe take the demon so buddy Why bring me a demon soul use it to bless you, okay?
[286:52.72]What exactly what exactly did that do I?
[287:00.65]Meat cleaver?
[287:01.41]Meat cleaver?
[287:03.13]Meat?
[287:03.55]What the fuck is this thing?
[287:05.31]What is this thing?
[287:06.21]Meat cleaver?
[287:08.86]That has S scaling.
[287:15.62]Whoa.
[287:19.18]Holy shit.
[287:20.28]Okay, hold on a minute.
[287:29.58]I should get it?
[287:33.58]Hands of God.
[287:38.82]So, I mean, should I get the fucking meat cleaver?
[287:45.88]Oh my god.
[287:46.74]Okay, um... Let's go.
[287:49.38]Meat cleaver.
[287:50.68]Does it matter what club I do it to?
[287:52.82]Should I do it to the great club or the regular club?
[287:54.50]Does it matter?
[288:03.76]I need 16 faith.
[288:09.84]Doesn't matter.
[288:12.66]Oh, fuck.
[288:13.06]I need, like, I need faith.
[288:14.14]How much faith do I have?
[288:18.10]Alright, here we go.
[288:19.88]Let's get the meat cleaver.
[288:24.90]Do it to the regular.
[288:26.24]Okay.
[288:28.58]Snacks with the cleaver kill you.
[288:32.92]Let's do it.
[288:33.38]That sounds cool.
[288:37.14]I can't.
[288:37.80]How much faith do I have?
[288:43.69]Eight.
[288:48.27]That's gonna take like 50,000 souls.
[289:00.01]Just do it and level Faith?
[289:02.06]That's not a good idea.
[289:03.20]I'm gonna- well, let me crush the Doll Soul, because I know I don't need that.
[289:14.51]It'll take long, but have faith.
[289:16.05]Get it anyways.
[289:16.65]Alright, well, let me break this thing.
[289:21.53]I'll get the Cleaver.
[289:23.07]It's the fun option.
[289:24.67]That sounds like a plan.
[289:27.58]This S scaling...
[289:33.63]Okay.
[289:34.43]Crush this dumb soul.
[289:37.07]Okay.
[289:42.68]So let's get the- let- let- hold on a minute.
[289:44.44]Come here.
[289:54.65]The hands of God, I mean, I don't- they can't do anything to thieves.
[289:58.49]Let's just do- I'm gonna do it.
[289:59.85]Why not?
[290:00.25]Let's just have a little bit of fucking fun, you know what I'm saying?
[290:06.00]Dragon longsword.
[290:09.37]Meat cleaver.
[290:09.89]Alright, meat cleaver.
[290:10.73]Here we go.
[290:15.47]Got it.
[290:17.25]Meat cleaver.
[290:17.91]He can turn it into a club!
[290:20.61]Well done.
[290:21.01]Let me just see what it looks like.
[290:23.69]I judge if I use a weapon pretty much solely based on how cool I think it looks.
[290:35.08]It's pretty cool.
[290:37.62]It's kind of cool.
[290:38.37]It's made... This thing is massive.
[290:49.09]Okay, so... Upgrade it to a club.
[290:52.29]In the meantime, let's get the... I don't know, it's a pyramid here.
[290:57.76]Let's upgrade the claymore.
[290:59.74]Put it to a crushing claymore.
[291:03.01]Get that scaling, buddy.
[291:06.59]Crushing claymore plus one.
[291:07.93]Crushing claymore plus two.
[291:12.96]And crushing claymore plus three.
[291:15.04]I can't do it yet.
[291:21.86]We have it.
[291:22.56]We own it.
[291:23.24]I own it now.
[291:26.07]Let's put on our crushing claymore.
[291:31.07]Just for shits, I'm curious.
[291:32.29]Let's see.
[291:34.74]126 plus 52.
[291:39.58]So, I mean, like, it's so ridiculous.

[291:49.89]Dual welded.
[291:51.31]Alright, let's go.
[291:51.89]What does it take to upgrade?
[291:54.03]Can I upgrade the cleaver?
[291:54.95]What does it take to upgrade the cleaver?
[291:56.69]I see that the cleaver can't be upgraded.
[291:58.75]Is that what I'm seeing here?
[291:59.77]Nah.
[292:02.18]Is that what I'm looking at here?
[292:09.87]Allegedly.
[292:10.29]As soon as I get faith, it's going to be huge.

[295:14.35]Thanks a lot, Poachfest.
[295:16.11]Pin, thanks for the bits.
[295:17.37]Just equip the Enigma.
[295:19.65]I know.
[295:20.85]God, Diablo 2 days.
[295:22.91]I missed that game.
[295:23.79]Diablo 3 just... They need to make a Diablo 2 remake.
[295:27.15]Or make Diablo 4 more like Diablo 2.
[295:29.61]We'll see.
[295:31.32]Cookie, thank you CookieCRM for the $5.
[295:32.92]Jeremiah, I asked for a double patty with the works, no pickles and no onions.
[295:36.72]And you put it on... How could you... I trusted you and you did this to me.
[295:40.88]Why?
[295:41.28]Jeremiah, I didn't make you any food.
[295:43.24]I'm not sure if you're confusing me about me being in your house.
[295:46.42]Cooking food for you, but I'm just, I'm not there.
[295:48.84]Somebody might look like me.
[295:49.90]They might be claiming to be me.
[295:51.62]But just like, just like my, some of my like random social media accounts that I don't have control over and I don't own.
[295:57.84]They post like random like fucked up pictures.
[296:00.05]It's not me.
[296:01.03]I have a Twitter, and I have a Facebook I never touch, and I have, like, Twitch and YouTube.
[296:04.89]I don't have anything else.
[296:06.51]So if anyone, like, if you see, like, a picture of, like, my balls or something, I've already made this.
[296:11.83]This is a reference from, like, five years ago now.
[296:14.31]Go back, like, five years and find the tweet where I said I'm not going to put a picture of my balls on, like, a random website.
[296:19.79]It's not me.
[296:21.93]But, anyways, thank you.
[296:24.49]Stix Renegade, thanks for the $5 earlier.
[296:26.28]We're getting back to like more than an hour ago.
[296:27.70]Hopefully you guys are still here.
[296:28.56]If not, then I still want to say thank you.
[296:31.02]I'm late.
[296:31.52]Probably will watch the VOD instead.
[296:33.08]Did you watch Rat Movie yet?
[296:34.70]Oh yeah, we watched it five times in a row.
[296:37.30]Yeah, we watched it ten times in a row.
[296:39.34]And we were all fucking laughing and like high-fiving and shit.
[296:41.60]It was awesome.
[296:42.64]But thanks for the $5, dude.
[296:43.32]MayQ.
[296:43.46]MayQ.
[296:45.24]Thank you, MayQ, for the $15.
[296:54.45]Make you Jill, make you G, whatever your name is.
[296:58.01]Thanks for the 15 bucks.
[296:59.71]Hey, Derma, I've loved you since I randomly stumbled across your YouTube channel.
[297:02.35]I just wanted to beat that top chair at least for a little bit.
[297:05.79]Well, you were there for a little while.
[297:07.58]Appreciate it, man.
[297:08.18]Thank you so much for the 15 bucks.
[297:11.47]Thank you, Rick Billy, as well.
[297:12.55]We're going back to, like, two hours ago now.
[297:14.55]So, when I, like, I like to keep up with, like, bits and shit, but obviously when I'm playing a game like this that requires, like, nearly 100% of my focus, I can't, like, just, my other screen might as well not even exist.
[297:27.99]Like, I look over at chat sometimes, but I get really tunnel visioned when I try to play these games that require a lot of focus, so sorry that I've been missing them.
[297:36.41]Uh, you're not a bastard.
[297:37.31]You're just like 60.
[297:38.47]Well, I'm close.
[297:39.95]Look, you want to know something weird?
[297:42.14]I'm closer to 60 than I am to zero.
[297:45.64]How fucking messed up is that?
[297:49.30]I am closer to 60 years old than I am to zero.
[297:56.37]Fuck me.
[297:59.16]Anyways, thank you, Horny Duck.
[298:00.85]Horny Ducks for the $5.
[298:02.15]They say game sucks.
[298:03.55]This is from two hours ago, so this is when I was saying game sucks.
[298:06.87]But the game doesn't suck.
[298:07.79]It's very good.
[298:09.39]In fact, like I said, I would put this up there somewhere between, like, Dark Souls 3 and, like, Dark Souls 1 and 2, whatever.
[298:15.81]I would put this above all the old ones.
[298:18.25]I think this one is more fun.
[298:21.03]Anyways, thank you, Horny Ducks for the $5.
[298:24.55]Thank you to King, King Roy, for the bits.
[298:26.53]When is the next dungeon stream?
[298:27.85]I know, I said I was going to beat Darkest Dungeon, and I got, like, addicted to fucking Demon's Souls, of course.
[298:32.41]Hopefully sometime soon.
[298:33.77]Who knows?
[298:35.78]Thanks for the bits, though, dude.
[298:36.82]Uh, we're going back four hours ago.
[298:40.60]Let me touch your bum.
[298:41.56]Thanks for the bits.
[298:42.12]Hey, German, I discovered your channel when somebody once told me that the world was going to roll me.
[298:46.36]And I like this guy who wasn't the sharpest tool in the shed on YouTube since then.
[298:49.40]Well, the streams don't stop coming, and they don't stop coming.
[298:51.62]Keep it up.
[298:52.06]Well, thanks a lot.
[298:52.78]With a clown face.
[298:55.71]We're going back on like four hour old jokes right now.
[298:57.85]This is great.
[298:58.37]I love it.
[299:00.47]From four hours ago.
[299:04.56]Muse, thanks for the bits from earlier.
[299:05.80]I'm so pumped about some shit from the thrift shop.
[299:08.62]Ice on the fridge.
[299:09.88]It's so damn frosty.
[299:10.98]These people like damn.

[299:31.25]Uh, thank you, JKLaser, for the bits of these.
[299:33.59]Our Macarena is the hotline bling.
[299:35.63]It was way bigger than that.
[299:37.28]It was like Drake times ten.
[299:39.52]Go look up, like, Macarena popularity.
[299:41.38]And, like, dude, everybody was doing it.
[299:42.44]Your mother, your grandmother, your kids.
[299:44.64]All of us were.
[299:48.48]Thank you, Velkrend, for the five dollars.
[299:51.12]Uh, hey, Jerem, love the streams.

[300:07.42]SuperSmashBrothersIcarus thanks for the bits.
[300:09.60]If you aren't going to dab, then what are you going to do about the haters?
[300:13.70]I'm going to not watch a Jake Paul video.
[300:17.26]That's what I'm gonna do.
[300:18.29]Gunther, uh, thank you for the $5, Gunther.
[300:20.37]I stand by your decision.
[300:21.41]Never dab.
[300:21.91]Never give it up on you.
[300:22.69]Pride.
[300:23.51]Also, please do a cool roll on stream.
[300:26.03]I must have done that a few times.
[300:27.17]Okay, I'll give you one right here.
[300:28.47]Fucking cool roll.
[300:31.08]Thanks a lot.

[300:45.65]I did.
[300:46.87]Thank you, though.
[300:49.14]Cabadger, Morthoid, Tub Tucker, JK Laser, all talking about dabs.

[301:11.94]Ain't going to happen.
[301:13.84]But thank you, though.
[301:14.38]Appreciate it.
[301:16.64]Sputnik from way, way long ago said, thank you for the $5, dude.

[301:22.24]I think I saw this earlier.
