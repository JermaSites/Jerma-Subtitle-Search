[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.62]I was an hour late?
[00:03.02]Wait, what?
[00:06.14]I was an hour late?
[00:07.94]Where?
[00:12.38]One?
[00:12.91]No, it's just one.
[00:13.59]I just had like a heart attack.
[00:17.25]I was like, wait, what are you talking about?
[00:18.23]It was 1 p.m., right?
[00:22.57]I'm like seven minutes late.
[00:25.37]You know.
[00:27.11]Otto did the thing where he walked around.
[00:29.63]And smelled every smell.
[00:32.05]And spun around three times, spun around three times.
[00:34.00]Nope, not here.
[00:37.32]Found another place to smell.
[00:40.00]Spin around, spin around this way.
[00:40.94]This is it.
[00:41.28]This is the place.
[00:42.40]No, it's not.
[00:44.32]And then finally took a fucking dump.
[00:48.05]He's smelling all the smelly smells.
[00:55.13]Savory dog.
[00:58.31]I don't need to go over that again.
[01:00.63]I don't need to go over that.
[01:02.95]Yeah, I gotta take care of Otto.
[01:08.94]Right, Otto?
[01:10.68]Oh, he needs his bed in here.
[01:29.77]Would you like the other one?
[01:35.13]Okay.
[01:39.95]Show us auto?
[01:40.77]No, I can't because I don't have any clothes on.
[01:45.71]No, no auto cam.
[01:46.54]No cam at all.
[01:47.52]I don't have any clothing on.
[01:53.40]Fucking put them on.
[01:54.40]No, I'm not going to put on clothes.
[01:56.60]You can't make me put clothes on, okay?
[02:01.28]I am a voice inside of your head right now.
[02:04.32]I'm talking to you.
[02:06.87]I'm just a voice.
[02:07.43]I don't have to have a body attached.
[02:10.81]I'm just a voice.
[02:11.41]Okay.
[02:18.29]Anyways, we're going to continue Pikmin 2.
[02:20.69]I'm having fun with it.
[02:21.31]I think it's a fun game.
[02:23.72]I have a few things to tell you.
[02:25.84]One specifically.
[02:27.18]I hope I'm not jumping the gun on this.
[02:28.84]Because we've just been essentially confirmed that it's probably going to happen.
[02:33.90]On this day.
[02:35.06]So I... I may or may not be jumping the gun.
[02:40.00]So keep that in mind.
[02:45.40]The archaeologist stream...
[02:49.05]is potentially like 80% confirmed to be on.
[02:54.73]Mark your calendar here.
[02:58.11]March 6th of 2021.
[02:59.99]It's going to be fun.
[03:13.30]Not Catboy.
[03:14.14]No, it is not Catboy.
[03:17.40]But I could be in a cat boy outfit.
[03:21.23]I will not be in a cat boy outfit on that stream.
[03:24.27]Let me make sure I get the record straight there.
[03:31.43]He's going to find a cat boy fossil skeleton.
[03:34.71]Well, thanks for the fucking free joke, because there's a, there's a bunch of jokes that are going to happen on that stream.
[03:41.04]Thanks for another one.
[03:43.20]I credit that to you, the person that just said that, because that would be kind of funny.
[03:46.02]Okay.
[03:48.50]I got to see if I can make that work.
[03:54.06]But it should be fun.
[03:55.24]Again, I don't want to jump the gun because we've been working diligently on trying to get this to happen.
[04:02.98]And over the next couple of weeks, especially, going to be doing a lot of stuff on it.
[04:07.11]So just to let you know, it's probably happening on March 6th.
[04:13.72]I know, jump with the gun.
[04:14.46]I don't want to jump with the gun.
[04:15.82]I'm sorry.
[04:16.72]I get on a phrase and I stay on it for like 10 minutes and then I never say that phrase again.
[04:23.36]Oh yeah, we'll get Pikmin 2 today.
[04:28.43]Don't forget to tweet.
[04:29.33]Oh, fuck.
[04:30.77]Thank you.
[04:39.40]Thank you for reminding me to open Twitter.
[04:42.16]I open Twitter like once every four days or three days or something.
[04:46.10]That's a lie.
[04:47.56]What a liar.
[04:48.64]I look at it every day.
[04:49.70]Yeah, I don't even like use technology.
[04:53.82]I don't even like use Twitter.
[04:55.56]That's a liar.
[04:56.56]I look at it every day.
[04:59.10]At least like in the evening when I'm about to go to bed.
[05:02.96]Okay, what should we title this?
[05:04.12]Pikmin.
[05:06.56]Pikmin 2 continues.
[05:09.14]Our epic journey.
[05:12.42]Not going to put the last part, but you get it.
[05:13.76]Let's tweak this.
[05:26.33]Why does Twitter do this shit?
[05:27.37]I don't like when Twitter does that.
[05:29.47]It gives a link before I'm done writing.
[05:32.97]That's annoying.
[05:35.31]How dare it do that?
[05:37.42]Alright, yeah, I'm into Pikmin 2.
[05:39.70]I can't say that what will happen after today, but maybe I'll still be into it.
[05:45.33]Make sure I get that right, OK.
[05:50.69]Facecam, I'm not putting a facecam on.
[05:57.01]You gonna play Yakuza again?
[05:58.01]That's the plan.
[06:03.54]Also, I don't have a date for this, but the Minecraft server, the actual JermaCraft Minecraft server is imminent as well.
[06:13.65]It's beautiful.
[06:15.35]It is absolutely beautiful.
[06:17.47]It's a gorgeous server.
[06:22.87]So look for that too soon.
[06:25.66]We'll be talking about that in detail over the next probably three or four weeks.
[06:33.63]Just take a quick sip out of my bottle.
[06:39.92]Will you visit it from time to time on stream?
[06:41.52]That's the plan.
[06:44.72]The plan is to visit that.
[06:47.04]Once a month, maybe.
[06:53.25]Maybe or so.
[06:54.45]Once every couple months.
[06:55.59]And go see what people are doing.
[06:57.19]Because on the last FTK stream...
[07:00.69]It was very clear that the second half was way more interesting to a lot of you than the first.
[07:08.49]That's the plan is to kind of do something like that.
[07:11.95]Again, I just want to bring this up because I brought it up like maybe a month ago is the last time we were here.
[07:17.09]Two months ago?
[07:18.57]Isn't it when we talked about it last?
[07:20.13]There is no date for this.
[07:23.21]But just know that like probably within the next couple of months, it will be a JermaCraft server up and running that you can play on.
[07:30.69]It's getting close.
[07:31.59]It's getting closer.
[07:32.39]Need a Huel cam.
[07:36.69]No, you don't need any cam.
[07:37.69]In fact, I'm gonna make sure, like, the camera's on.
[07:41.19]I hate that, knowing that that could just be turned on.
[07:43.28]Alright, because in... We already saw this.
[07:50.72]In my OBS preview, I can look over here and see that the cam is ready.
[07:56.45]And the camera is physically pointing at me, and the lights are on.
[07:59.29]So it's just like, this shit is on.
[08:06.65]The lights are just lit up, just ready to capture me naked.
[08:09.91]I'm not even naked, though.
[08:15.21]You know what?
[08:15.59]Here's what I can tell you.
[08:20.10]Okay, you know how you go to sleep every night?
[08:23.40]That's how I'm dressed.
[08:25.30]I have pajama pants on and no shirt.
[08:27.38]That's just what I do.
[08:28.06]That's how I live every day.
[08:31.66]Pajama pants and no shirt on.
[08:33.37]That's how humans sleep.
[08:42.57]Just unplug the camera.
[08:44.08]No, because then what if I unplug it?
[08:45.58]I crash OBS.
[08:46.84]Alright, so we left off.
[08:50.24]I had just gotten the blue Pikmin.
[08:52.34]I'm very excited.
[08:53.38]Can you hear it in my voice?
[08:55.58]Yay.
[08:56.08]Can't wait to fucking play this game again.
[08:57.34]I want to go here.
[09:04.59]He's bored already.
[09:05.81]I want to go... Because there's some water things in here, right?
[09:08.97]No, wait.
[09:09.25]No, I don't.
[09:12.47]How many water Pikmin do I have?
[09:13.45]Can I see?
[09:24.31]He hates it.
[09:28.74]I'm just going to go here, whatever.
[09:30.24]I think I have enough water Pikmin.
[09:31.88]I should have like 20, right?
[09:36.38]Only that they're perplexing.
[09:37.40]Boom.
[09:42.21]Chat, you're creepy.
[09:43.09]I already said, Chat, you are wicked creepy.
[09:48.19]Alright, what do we got here?
[09:53.46]Citadel of Spiders.
[09:55.72]Now, there's a water thing to do here.
[09:57.10]Let me just, let me take a look around first.
[10:00.74]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:01.94]Let's get some, a good look.
[10:04.96]All 18 of them.
[10:09.66]More like wicked fucked.
[10:11.84]Wicked.
[10:13.64]I'll do that.
[10:14.52]That'd be wicked funny.
[10:20.32]And electricity.
[10:25.55]Do 30 electric.
[10:31.07]And then we have some big boys, right?
[10:32.85]How many big boys do I have?
[10:39.65]Ooh, that's not good.
[10:43.77]Only five?
[10:44.45]What happened?
[10:44.93]What happened to the big guys?
[10:46.60]Stewie?
[10:50.88]What happened to the big ones?
[10:53.60]Brian, didn't we have 20 purple Pikmin?
[10:58.09]We did, Stewie, but you killed them all.
[10:59.79]No, I didn't kill them.
[11:01.03]You did.
[11:09.16]Everybody fucking hates Family Guy.
[11:10.58]You all like Family Guy.
[11:12.76]We talked about this like two months ago.
[11:15.43]Family Guy, you all hate it.
[11:16.79]Oh, shut up.
[11:17.41]I hate Stewie.
[11:18.67]But you'll watch it on TBS every day.
[11:21.35]I know all of you watch Adult Swim.
[11:23.19]And Family Guy's on Adult Swim.
[11:25.34]Family Guy is the Teen Titans of Adult Swim.
[11:28.98]You watch it every time it's on.
[11:36.30]No, you don't.
[11:36.74]You don't?
[11:38.88]Oh, bridge.
[11:39.32]Okay, here we go.
[11:41.64]Let's kill this guy.
[11:48.08]Only boomers.
[11:49.10]Family Guy literally sucks.
[11:50.62]Yeah, but that doesn't matter.
[11:51.86]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:54.48]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[11:55.88]Bring everybody over here.
[11:57.28]No, just purples.
[11:58.78]Bring everybody.
[11:59.46]Fuck it, whatever.
[11:59.98]That guy's going to jump on me.
[12:02.97]I know it.
[12:03.35]Alright, let's kill all this stuff.
[12:10.44]Boomers.
[12:13.82]Wait, is Adult Swim Boomer now?
[12:15.84]I was under the impression that it wasn't.
[12:22.59]Kill it.
[12:22.89]There we go.
[12:23.79]No!
[12:28.83]It kind of is.
[12:33.03]You know, maybe I am getting a little older.
[12:34.65]Because I turned on Adult Swim recently.
[12:38.05]And I thought all the shows were just fucking terrible.
[12:42.15]Am I getting old?
[12:43.57]Because I used to watch it all the time.
[12:44.71]They are.
[12:49.90]Okay, hopefully this guy doesn't kill me.
[12:53.14]We need to build this bridge.
[12:58.18]I'm going to leave Louie over here in case they attack.
[13:02.68]Louis, come over here.
[13:07.82]Just in case this guy attacks, I gotta be ready for it.
[13:13.67]Yeah, I mean, I like Eric Andre.
[13:15.13]I think he's funny.
[13:16.43]But I don't really think anything else is.
[13:19.17]Don't attack.
[13:24.34]Don't attack.
[13:24.72]Don't attack.
[13:25.08]Don't attack.
[13:25.50]Don't attack.
[13:25.94]Don't!
[13:26.18]I'm fine now.
[13:30.32]There's treasure here, too.
[13:31.26]Oh, shit.
[13:31.88]I need that because I want these guys to be... Yes.
[13:33.32]Alright, I'm ready to drink it.
[13:38.60]Rick and Morty re.
[13:41.96]Okay.
[13:42.26]Alright.
[13:42.98]Fine.
[13:43.64]When Rick and Morty airs every three years, I guess, sure, you could watch it.
[13:48.43]Is he just going to fight me?
[13:55.57]Is he going to... He is.
[13:57.43]He is.
[13:57.71]He is.
[13:57.99]He is.
[13:58.31]Alright.
[13:58.51]You know what?
[13:58.79]Just kill him.
[13:59.13]Go for it.
[14:00.69]We can do it.
[14:02.68]Everybody come back.
[14:04.56]No, come back.
[14:05.26]I'm fine.
[14:13.29]Don't crush him.
[14:19.31]Come back.
[14:19.95]I don't know what it is.
[14:21.99]You know, you could title this video for the second channel.
[14:25.78]By the way, if you're not subscribed to the second channel, what are you doing?
[14:29.30]What are you thinking?
[14:39.90]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill it, kill it.
[14:45.66]I'm so afraid of him squashing.
[14:50.40]He's going to do it.
[14:51.02]Just wait for him to do it.
[14:56.81]There it is, kill.
[14:58.12]Got it.
[14:58.56]Nice.
[14:59.62]Perfect.
[15:00.02]Alright.
[15:00.30]Now, build a bridge.
[15:05.76]You're scared of a frog.
[15:07.58]Yes.
[15:08.44]Because if it squashes them, then I only have like 15 of these guys.
[15:10.96]20 of these guys.
[15:11.52]Aha!
[15:13.00]Alright.
[15:13.36]Good.
[15:14.68]Yeah.
[15:14.82]Bring this back too.
[15:19.34]Don't go in the water.
[15:19.96]Go over the bridge.
[15:20.38]Alright.
[15:22.92]Now, what's over here?
[15:24.03]There's treasure over here, right?
[15:24.99]Where are my white
[15:28.55]Anybody want to dig?
[15:31.43]Wait, what?
[15:34.61]Wait, was the whole point of that to... Oh.
[15:40.63]What was the point of coming over here with the bridge?
[15:42.49]Can I break this?
[15:47.50]Why would there be a bridge over here?
[15:49.76]I could throw yellow over there?
[15:50.96]Yeah, I could, but wouldn't they... Was it just to throw yellow over the bridge?
[15:59.58]They're not going to get stuck over there, are they?
[16:00.70]I hope not.
[16:03.40]They're not going to get stuck over here, right?
[16:10.40]Are they going to get stuck over here?
[16:18.63]Hmm.
[16:30.35]They'll bring that down?
[16:31.87]Oh my god, we gotta go.
[16:32.65]What are they doing?
[16:40.48]It's alright.
[16:41.46]I'll get it.
[16:41.76]It's off-locked?
[16:46.44]Well, not yet.
[16:47.04]Hold on.
[16:48.48]Don't drown.
[16:51.52]Um... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:55.58]Okay, okay, I'm good, I'm good.
[16:59.27]I'm gonna sit here for a sec.
[17:01.73]And then I'm gonna call these guys back.
[17:06.14]Alright, now go over there and... My mouth peaked.
[17:12.16]My mouth peaked.
[17:13.63]Did you hear that shit?
[17:14.47]That was not my microphone.
[17:15.47]That was my mouth.
[17:18.95]I peaked the inside of my microphone.
[17:20.53]My mouth.
[17:21.31]That was fucking crazy.
[17:22.15]Are they doing it?
[17:28.78]Alright, break up for a second.
[17:30.02]Alright, and then I'm going to... How am I going to get them back over here?
[17:37.56]I could throw them.
[17:40.00]I need blue to pick that up.
[17:45.30]Can they go over this way?
[17:45.94]I don't know.
[17:51.40]Can they?
[17:56.76]I kind of want to hear that.
[17:59.72]The noise I made with my mouth and my saliva or something sounded like a peaked microphone.
[18:08.90]Throw them over?
[18:09.53]I can throw... Yeah, but I don't want to touch the electric fence.
[18:21.41]I wish I could move the camera like Mario 64.
[18:22.98]Don't I have more of these?
[18:28.26]Where are the other blue...
[18:33.12]Are they on the back of the ship?
[18:34.16]They are.
[18:34.54]Louie, go get them.
[18:43.69]Go get them, Louie.
[18:49.59]I see.
[18:49.81]Are they fighting him?
[18:57.16]Where's the ace out there?
[19:04.50]Alright, come back.
[19:05.62]Oh, hold on.
[19:09.28]Is he playing on the Wii?
[19:10.00]I am playing on the Wii U, to be exact.
[19:16.00]Okay, so now, anybody, any stragglers?
[19:19.37]I don't think so.
[19:20.03]I just have to go straight this way.
[19:24.59]Wait, can I cross the bridge?
[19:28.65]Uh, no.
[19:29.31]Wait, can I?
[19:29.81]No.
[19:31.94]No.
[19:37.38]I won't fight him, just run.
[19:45.80]Oh, title of the video.
[19:47.09]What's the title of the video?
[19:47.99]The title of the video is going to be... Overreactor.
[19:53.31]Pikmin Overreactor.
[19:54.45]Because that's what I'm doing.
[19:55.33]I'm just like... It's like a kid's game.
[20:02.89]Why am I trying to make it sound so much more dramatic?
[20:05.31]I'm not even trying to though, I promise.
[20:08.69]Alright, here we go.
[20:10.33]Who's dying?
[20:12.31]Oh my God.
[20:12.91]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[20:15.65]No, no, no, no, no.
[20:18.27]Okay.
[20:18.77]Pikmin overreactor.
[20:23.19]Sorry.
[20:24.53]I just did the exact thing that I told you.
[20:27.87]Alright.
[20:28.18]Everybody relax.
[20:29.02]Come here.
[20:29.86]I only want the exact fucking thing I was talking about.
[20:37.20]Alright.
[20:37.50]Can you guys get this?
[20:40.03]15.
[20:40.11]Alright, get it.
[20:41.41]Nice.
[20:42.95]The rest of you need to be thrown.
[20:51.84]Don't pull it into the water.
[20:53.69]What are you, dumb?
[20:55.51]Oh, my God.
[20:56.65]Alright.
[20:58.37]Well, today's almost over anyways.
[21:11.85]And the thumbnail can be like a nuclear reactor and it going off and it has my face kind of embedded into it going like, Whoa.
[21:18.36]Oh God.
[21:32.48]It's perfect timing on his part.
[21:34.93]Kill him.
[21:35.43]Oh my God.
[21:38.31]He almost just splash damage killed everybody.
[21:42.55]I'm missing anybody.
[21:58.75]Jeremy, when are you going to come out with a vegan burger?
[22:01.67]Um, I'm not.
[22:02.91]I'm sorry to disappoint you.
[22:08.53]Alright, hold on.
[22:09.02]These idiots just put five... A five blue coin into a red box.
[22:16.20]Did they just mess that up?
[22:19.02]That's basic colors.
[22:22.15]They took the blue coin and put it in a red box.
[22:23.95]Does that matter?
[22:30.12]Stop!
[22:32.20]It does matter, doesn't it?
[22:38.93]Pikmin carry stuff to their own onion, dummy.
[22:42.09]That was a blue coin.
[22:44.05]Why would they do that?
[22:48.35]Can they not see blue?
[22:49.67]Can they not see the color blue?
[22:56.48]There's a red majority carrying it.
[22:58.06]But red majority cannot put the blue coin into the blue container?
[23:06.22]Why not?
[23:06.52]Alright, we'll have to remember that next time.
[23:15.87]I'm bringing way less reds next time, by the way.
[23:17.93]They just overpower everything.
[23:21.67]I need a few more purples.
[23:25.70]Because they pick up everything and they just take everything.
[23:27.86]Alright, I'm good.
[23:33.68]At least I got a treasure.
[23:41.85]Politics?
[23:45.69]Okay, well then Team Fortress 2 is politics.
[23:48.18]That's red versus blue.
[23:51.36]It's always like fucking Halo.
[23:52.96]Halo.
[23:54.80]Okay?
[23:55.20]Every video game ever that had the two contrasting red and blue colors versus each other.
[23:59.68]They just got to get rid of the politics in those games.
[24:16.15]Based?
[24:16.53]That's not even... That's not based.
[24:19.20]That's just... What?
[24:25.42]You just ruined all video games.
[24:29.97]That was a flame ball backs.
[24:32.37]What?
[24:33.49]I can't even believe it.
[24:37.94]140.
[24:38.24]I keep putting a drink down in front of my Wii sensor bar and it keeps screwing everything up.
[24:49.54]Some say that you should look at the past, to places you have been already, in order to make new finds.
[24:55.16]Of course, extraordinary people like me always press onward.
[25:04.81]Scroll down, it's got one like on it.
[25:09.66]And by the way, that's like the 30th time they've posted today.
[25:23.37]Should I go back here?
[25:23.91]Fun fact, you can use fire as a Wii sensor bar.
[25:34.17]Oh yeah, that's right.
[25:34.73]You can put candles up, right?
[25:39.22]Liked own post.
[25:42.96]Boomer Twitter?
[25:44.40]No.
[25:45.86]Yeah, and then there was one comment.
[25:54.59]It's just, are you coming over for dinner tomorrow?
[25:58.47]It's like grandma.
[26:13.90]No, less red.
[26:16.62]I want a blue, I...
[26:20.89]I want a blue majority.
[26:22.99]I don't want a red majority.
[26:25.45]Look, go ahead.
[26:26.05]You can't clip it out.
[26:27.53]He's just a psycho.
[26:50.19]Someone's going to just take that and be like, I knew he was a Democrat.
[26:54.33]Who even cares?
[26:55.21]Does anybody really fucking care?
[26:59.26]I'm playing Pikmin 2.
[27:00.04]Does anybody actually give a shit about where I might lean politically?
[27:04.20]Does anybody even care?
[27:05.22]He's finally lost it.
[27:20.28]Okay, I don't need to bring 100 people.
[27:22.78]This will be good.
[27:26.73]Who needs to be... Who needs to drink?
[27:28.53]Of course we do.
[27:31.09]Alright, we're actually going here?
[27:36.58]What's this place?
[27:37.24]A cavern?
[27:38.36]I got the bridge.
[27:39.04]Now what's over here?
[27:41.04]Fight!
[27:41.38]Fight!
[27:42.36]Fight!
[27:44.00]Fight!
[27:50.94]I've made that reference probably a hundred times.
[27:54.86]Ooh, these are new.
[27:55.88]These are new bugs.
[27:56.42]Get them!
[28:01.41]Didn't get a chance to eat them.
[28:02.09]Good.
[28:02.31]Okay.
[28:04.41]You know where to take that.
[28:11.19]Okay, now... That's open.
[28:14.03]Is there anything even in there?
[28:15.59]Besides that?
[28:16.11]There might be a secret in there.
[28:23.10]No.
[28:25.12]Just empty?
[28:25.74]Okay.
[28:27.55]But I can go over here.
[28:28.65]Oh, another electric fence over there.
[28:30.07]Alright, we're going to go this way.
[28:34.76]Uh-oh.
[28:35.22]Here's the worst thing.
[28:36.32]The worst part about this.
[29:09.70]I want to be Louis down there.
[29:14.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[29:16.32]I hate this fucking thing.
[29:18.72]Though I even put the elevator in this.
[29:20.62]Like, I know you want to like, oh, you're way down with the big one.
[29:23.10]Who cares?
[29:24.22]This is stupid.
[29:24.94]I hate this.
[29:30.02]No, I don't.
[29:30.86]Stop coming with me.
[29:32.58]Stop coming with me.
[29:33.76]Hey!
[29:52.60]Kill it.
[29:53.22]Come on.
[29:54.96]Way him down.
[30:01.00]Kill it!
[30:01.68]Weigh it down.
[30:03.10]Oh my god.
[30:06.47]Kill it?
[30:08.27]Thank you.
[30:14.31]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[30:15.69]Hold on.
[30:17.68]First let me hit C, then 1, then C, then A, then B. To send the other guy that... Who cares?
[30:23.42]Why is this guy even in the game?
[30:27.34]Stop doing that.
[30:28.20]I told you to stop.
[30:29.64]Oh, my God.
[30:30.50]Why did you come over here?
[30:32.26]I don't... Stop picking that up.
[30:36.78]Put it down.
[30:39.44]Yo.
[30:42.71]We lost a bug.
[30:43.93]I don't care.
[30:44.35]I put Louie in this game to sell toys.
[30:53.39]It's the only reason why he's here.
[31:07.09]Drink up.
[31:19.54]He hates Louie.
[31:28.77]What's over here?
[31:32.59]Is Louie in Pikmin 3 as a playable character?
[31:35.31]I want to just yes or no's.
[31:43.21]No.
[31:43.49]Okay.
[31:44.11]That's all I needed to know.
[31:44.75]That's the only thing I need to know.
[31:48.41]Watch out.
[31:56.04]Very good.
[32:04.18]What is, um... Well, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[32:06.45]There's not enough here.
[32:08.39]Uh, speaking of Louie...
[32:13.92]You go back here and go get everybody.
[32:17.56]They all go.
[32:21.58]He's sold?
[32:28.81]By the way, why does the whistle work on people?
[32:32.83]Hold on.
[32:33.27]I gotta zoom out.
[32:36.15]How come I can use the whistle on Louie?
[32:38.23]Isn't...
[32:51.19]It works on you too.
[32:52.11]Yeah, I don't want the whistle to work on me.
[32:54.45]If I'm going to have two separate captains, I don't want to be like, hey, you can...
[33:13.32]Oh my god, Nintendo, why does every... Oh, I'm already getting mad at the fucking controls.
[33:19.92]A is throw and A is also grab.
[33:36.59]Use the bridge?
[33:37.63]Does it not go over here?
[33:39.05]I thought the bridge didn't go over here.
[33:50.66]Alright, everybody fucking get over here.
[34:00.20]We good?
[34:02.75]Alright.
[34:03.79]Let's go.
[34:07.03]I want yellows.
[34:10.75]Look at that great traction.
[34:11.99]Go over here.
[34:16.90]Take that down.
[34:17.42]We got killed.
[34:20.81]Who died?
[34:21.17]I just fell down here.
[34:26.03]Oh, shit.
[34:26.53]I can't go back up.
[34:27.50]Okay, well, I'm going to go this way.
[34:29.70]Avoid the frog.
[34:30.56]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[34:37.56]Don't go over there.
[34:39.34]Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie, Louie.
[34:42.16]Oh, my God.
[34:46.47]No, no, no.
[34:50.63]Come on, you're OK.
[34:51.39]You're OK.
[34:51.73]Everyone's fine.
[34:56.13]Alright, go take it down.
[35:07.66]I want Louie Bay him over here.
[35:17.38]Thank God he's in the game.
[35:19.42]Thank God I have this.
[35:21.42]Thank God I can do this.
[35:22.08]Everything I said previously, I take back completely.
[35:33.45]There's a cave in there.
[35:34.35]Ooh, okay, cool.
[35:34.91]Alright, now come over here and weigh this thing down so I can go up.
[35:44.24]Almost done.
[35:44.62]Then I'm going to grab everybody and we're going to go in the hole.
[35:47.72]I'm just distracting this Pollywog, whatever it is.
[35:59.39]Don't kill Loof.
[36:03.35]You know what?
[36:03.73]Like, whatever.
[36:06.66]Don't jump over there.
[36:07.56]At least do a facecam.
[36:10.60]I'm not putting on a facecam.
[36:18.70]Gooey, gooey, gooey, Louie.
[36:20.18]Yeah, that's the booger.
[36:21.10]That's the one with the boogers.
[36:23.64]Okay, everybody come with me.
[36:27.54]Alright.
[36:29.98]We need somebody to go back and get the rest.
[36:31.08]Alright, Louie.
[36:33.70]Go get them.
[36:35.60]No, I'll get them.
[36:36.06]All of them are.
[36:37.87]I have to go around?
[36:40.59]Don't go up there and kill everybody, please.
[36:45.39]Okay, I need you guys to come help me knock this... Not all of you!
[36:52.49]Oh, god damn it.
[36:54.44]Oh, god, no.
[36:55.84]What the fuck?
[36:58.14]What the fuck, man?
[37:01.51]It's just so...
[37:14.47]It's fun when I can collect coins and stuff.
[37:16.61]I don't want to micromanage 5,000 fucking people.
[37:33.94]There's a treasure over here, but I don't care.
[37:35.28]I want to go in the cave.
[37:38.06]Alright, where are we at?
[37:38.78]Where's the other team?
[37:44.41]Where's the other guy?
[37:46.78]Okay, over here?
[37:47.30]Can I get over there from here?
[37:56.64]Okay, here we go.
[38:02.82]Holy shit.
[38:03.10]Alright, I'm going to get in the cave.
[38:06.96]Everybody drink?
[38:08.59]Everybody's drank.
[38:09.07]Okay, let's go.
[38:12.78]It also doesn't help that the whole ground looks just like I have a thousand upload right now.
[38:24.62]Strong scent.
[38:32.07]Okay.
[38:34.37]You're both drooling.
[38:35.23]I wish just once.
[38:35.83]Is there food down here?
[38:42.86]88 out of 88.
[38:43.68]That's good.
[38:44.84]Let's do it.
[38:47.90]Let's go with the whole squad.
[39:03.05]That's supposed to be a family friendly stream.
[39:12.49]Is it?
[39:14.65]Alright.
[39:14.91]What do we got?
[39:17.49]I only have a few.
[39:18.01]Hopefully there's not a lot of fire here.
[39:22.24]What's over there?
[39:23.92]Oh, shit.
[39:24.56]Okay.
[39:27.86]Where's purple?
[39:34.58]Well, everybody back.
[39:35.21]Come on.
[39:35.49]Back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[39:39.61]We died?
[39:40.03]Why are you even over there?
[39:46.60]Oh my god.
[39:53.80]I gotta turn my body and rest my arm on the fucking stupid thing again.
[39:59.48]Remember, I'm holding out the Wiimote like a remote control.
[40:02.90]Permanently.
[40:03.32]Oh, I'm already getting annoyed by this.
[40:06.40]Like, upset by this.
[40:18.41]Alright, my wrist is resting, and I'm in a position where the sensor bar can see it.
[40:24.01]Let me see if I can do this.
[40:24.70]Can I pull this?
[40:29.20]Alright.
[40:30.74]Alright, I'm good.
[40:32.08]Give me purple.
[40:38.40]Purple, please.
[40:42.73]No, just everybody in.
[40:43.55]Everybody in.
[40:43.91]Just go.
[40:44.35]Overwhelm them with overwhelming numbers.
[40:45.73]Go.
[40:45.83]Go.
[40:56.27]Good.
[40:56.73]Alright.
[40:57.17]Bring him back.
[40:57.53]I'm losing the sensor.
[41:13.80]Only three purples are alive?
[41:15.40]That's okay.
[41:15.80]I'll get more.
[41:17.44]Alright.
[41:21.39]Let me move the sensor bar to like here.
[41:23.97]That'll help.
[41:26.17]Maybe?
[41:26.37]Maybe a little.
[41:29.75]Alright, where's the treasure?
[41:33.08]Oh, okay.
[41:39.22]It's like a glue stick.
[41:41.38]He's fucking angry.
[41:42.76]Wait, are they gonna get trapped in here?
[41:54.71]Trying to aim with this fucking thing is so hard.
[41:59.45]I feel like I'm doing surgery to try to throw a Pikmin over a goddamn bridge.
[42:11.72]Can they climb up?
[42:18.60]They can get out this way, right?
[42:23.95]My grandma had an easy time using the Wii because she played for 15 minutes.
[42:28.55]Once.
[42:29.39]And then it sat on her shelf.
[42:30.62]She played it for like 10 minutes.
[42:32.54]Total.
[42:34.00]Maybe one hour of total game time.
[42:37.56]Ever.
[42:43.29]Ooh, that was worth a lot.
[42:54.07]wrong it was a gamer grandma what would a gamer grandma be you're weaker than a grandma I don't even know what he's talking about
[43:17.76]My forearm doesn't start to burn after 25 minutes of holding it in the same place.
[43:24.46]I do just fine with my Wiimote.
[43:27.26]Thank you, grandson.
[43:30.61]Lactic acid doesn't exist.
[43:32.39]It's a made up term that's a scientist made up.
[43:41.41]What is this?
[43:46.04]Go in there?
[43:47.71]No, no, no.
[43:52.17]That's cope.
[43:53.71]I don't care.
[43:54.43]I don't care what it is.
[43:56.57]Easy, easy, easy, easy.
[43:59.69]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[44:01.39]There's so many weird mutant creatures in here.
[44:03.77]Alright, get him.
[44:15.44]Those things are not violent?
[44:21.37]I gotta kill this thing.
[44:22.43]It has to die.
[44:32.75]Okay, easy.
[44:38.14]He killed an innocent creature.
[44:42.50]Is anything ever truly innocent?
[44:45.76]Alright, let's start collecting.
[44:54.81]Where's this?
[44:55.75]Hey!
[44:57.01]That's our fruit!
[45:02.17]He got it.
[45:05.49]He actually got it.
[45:07.23]He stole it.
[45:08.31]He stole it from us.
[45:15.81]Get away.
[45:16.97]Don't touch that.
[45:17.55]He doesn't eat Pikmin, does he?
[45:21.61]I don't think so.
[45:24.37]let's keep going they're just irritating they're not really that scary they kind of just get in the way is that a purple flower thank god it is uh get that bottle cap
[46:03.34]Hold on, I... You don't have any idea how much that, like, hurts.
[46:13.89]To, like, aim up there and keep it right there.
[46:16.21]I'm so glad this shit, like, died.
[46:20.39]I'm so happy that everyone thought we were gonna go to... Oh, man, motion controls are gonna take over.
[46:25.58]It's gonna be what everybody... No, no, it's not.
[46:27.88]The PS5 controller is a fucking controller.
[46:30.02]It's a regular goddamn controller.
[46:31.52]I'm so glad we didn't go from here.
[46:42.29]What about VR?
[46:43.01]No, VR is completely different.
[46:44.31]VR is like your actual hands.
[46:45.28]I'm not pointing an ice cream sandwich at a fucking red sensor.
[46:53.72]That's what this thing is.
[46:54.48]It's a heat sensor.
[46:55.50]Whatever the hell it is.
[46:56.14]I don't know.
[46:56.50]I have no idea what this is.
[46:57.72]It's a camera.
[46:59.16]It's a heat camera.
[47:00.77]Thermal camera.
[47:01.47]Whatever the hell it is.
[47:04.13]Infrared.
[47:04.61]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[47:05.13]That's what I meant.
[47:20.07]Get this.
[47:23.65]I'm very angry today.
[47:25.33]I'm very upset today for some reason.
[47:31.53]Why am I so angry?
[47:34.07]I'm so annoyed.
[47:38.63]I don't know why.
[47:39.53]Why?
[47:39.87]There's no reason for me to be annoyed.
[47:42.91]Fuck this controller and fuck this system.
[47:44.52]Fuck this whole console.
[47:53.28]I'm just kidding, geez.
[47:54.42]Is he stuck?
[48:14.78]Somebody said, Frankie Wanky.
[48:19.26]I have nothing to be upset about.
[48:23.37]Shit's going, like, real well.
[48:24.80]I don't know.
[48:25.16]I just, I don't know.
[48:26.10]Something about, like, maybe it's the whistle.
[48:28.26]That's, like, making me mad.
[48:29.44]It's like, ugh, like, shut up, whistle.
[48:33.37]Right?
[48:33.61]Isn't that making you mad?
[48:34.57]Oh, I want to go to the flower.
[48:52.21]Who do I want to turn?
[48:53.05]I don't have any reds left, do I?
[48:55.19]Do I have any red?
[48:58.97]I might have exactly five reds.
[49:00.65]Mmm, three.
[49:04.15]I could do a couple of blues or yellow.
[49:15.07]I'll do it with yellow.
[49:27.71]Stop, stop, what?
[49:29.81]Laugh out loud, what?
[49:35.34]Keep the yellows?
[49:35.98]What do I do with white then?
[49:41.76]Oh no, white's pretty rare.
[49:42.87]Oh, is it red?
[49:43.81]I have red.
[49:50.12]I'm, I wish I could, I want to turn the facecam on right now so you can see what I'm doing right now.
[49:54.96]I have both hands on the fucking Wiimote, and I'm leaning my neck down, stuffed into my body.
[49:59.97]Like, perched, trying desperately to hold it right here.
[50:05.87]I don't have clothes on, so I can't do that.
[50:18.26]Alright, next level.
[50:19.08]Next layer.
[50:19.46]Where are you going?
[50:21.78]Get over here.
[50:22.12]You're playing your... Did I lose anybody back here?
[50:33.86]No, where's the exit?
[50:39.08]Who shows up naked?
[50:40.00]I don't have to have any clothes on.
[50:44.53]If I don't say anything, you guys wouldn't even know.
[50:51.22]I'm just a voice in your ear.
[50:53.06]If I didn't tell you I didn't have clothes on, some of you could have thought I was in a suit, for all you knew.
[50:57.00]What do we got?
[51:08.46]We got electricity.
[51:09.42]Ooh, what do I do about that?
[51:15.54]I feel like, I don't know, is blue going to be in short supply?
[51:26.24]How many blues am I going to have over the course of the game?
[51:33.57]You don't really need blue?
[51:36.85]Okay.
[51:37.03]Thanks for the tip.
[51:37.95]Appreciate it, guys.
[51:54.57]A is throw, A is grab.
[51:58.58]Why?
[52:00.18]I feel like I'm... Ooh, nectar!
[52:06.36]Alright, break it.
[52:21.81]Everybody drink?
[52:25.24]Yes, OK.
[52:27.06]Now let's go.
[52:28.24]That's a lightning bug.
[52:29.76]Stay away.
[52:31.28]Don't even wait, don't.
[52:34.76]I'm not going to.
[52:35.62]I'm not risking this.
[52:36.28]Everybody come over here.
[52:42.47]We're going to go around with yellow.
[52:43.49]I got I got a white here.
[52:48.19]I don't want that white.
[52:49.49]Here we go.
[52:49.87]Alright.
[52:51.05]Let's make sure this is safe first.
[52:52.46]If we go any further.
[52:58.66]How do I bet on this with DraftKings?
[53:04.69]You can't.
[53:11.62]Kill him!
[53:13.08]Kill him!
[53:13.88]He's upside down!
[53:15.30]Break his bones!
[53:31.74]Whiskey, get away from me.
[53:35.70]Bugs don't have bones?
[53:37.22]Wrong.
[53:37.54]Their entire body is a bone.
[53:40.47]Exoskeletons.
[53:51.61]Kill it.
[54:02.55]Alright, we're clearing.
[54:04.37]I feel like I'm playing an MMO.
[54:07.93]We're just clearing trash.
[54:11.83]So then we can actually do the thing we want to do.
[54:18.72]Okay.
[54:19.70]Looks good.
[54:24.96]Bingo.
[54:25.80]I didn't say wow.
[54:26.66]I said A-M-M-O.
[54:45.92]A-M-M-O.
[54:47.68]A-M-O.
[54:50.94]Come on, get him.
[54:51.72]Flip him over quickly, please.
[54:53.24]A-M-M-O.
[54:59.98]I didn't say M-M-O.
[55:01.28]I said A-L-M-A-O.
[55:02.94]I thought what you said was very funny.
[55:09.94]Whatever, he can have it.
[55:10.60]I don't want it.
[55:11.00]Alright, that's good.
[55:14.12]It's safe now.
[55:18.70]Is it safe?
[55:19.82]It's safe.
[55:20.10]There's a big tambourine over here.
[55:23.25]Oh, it's not safe yet.
[55:25.71]This would have killed me later.
[55:29.39]What the fuck is that?
[55:30.29]Oh my God, run.
[55:33.58]No!
[55:36.56]Come back.
[55:36.80]I got to run away.
[55:37.64]Run away.
[55:38.04]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[55:39.76]I got to come.
[55:40.14]I got to come back with purple.
[55:45.46]Oh my god, he's flying.
[55:46.42]He sees everybody.
[55:47.16]Shit.
[55:49.42]Okay, we're good.
[55:50.02]We're good.
[55:50.24]We're good.
[55:50.48]We're good.
[55:51.10]I gotta throw purples at him to take him down?
[56:01.97]Wait till he... I'm gonna wait till he does the blow.
[56:05.43]Alright, come with me.
[56:06.24]Don't get caught in that.
[56:12.16]Oh my god!
[56:16.37]We're gonna come back.
[56:19.76]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[56:20.22]We're fine.
[56:21.82]Run, Purple!
[56:22.50]What are you doing standing there like an idiot?
[56:35.88]Kill him!
[56:46.36]Are those spikes on his back?
[56:48.14]Am I throwing them into spikes?
[57:01.00]Purple, no!
[57:04.10]What are you doing?
[57:04.78]He didn't die, right?
[57:08.62]Oh, thank God.
[57:09.22]Okay, we're good.
[57:13.32]Purple, no!
[57:16.31]I don't even care if he takes them.
[57:17.41]Alright, here we go.
[57:18.83]Now I get my double treasure.
[57:22.65]This really is an overreaction stream.
[57:24.71]I know.
[57:25.05]I don't know what I'm doing that for.
[57:26.17]That's not a... Tambourine's not a treasure?
[57:40.95]Is your sensor bar set to above?
[57:42.01]No.
[57:42.07]It's set to below TV.
[57:56.13]please take a break it's distressing to see you hold on you see this is please take a break it's distressing to see you play when you aren't in a good mindset and not only does your gameplay suffer but we do please take a break I I just started like an hour ago
[58:20.72]I would have to be next level baby.
[58:24.64]Or if I needed to take a break within like 20 minutes of playing the game.
[58:28.01]Okay, at that point, it's like it's not take a break.
[58:30.09]It's don't play the game anymore because you don't like it.
[58:38.16]Is it necessarily take a break?
[58:44.90]Starting up a game in 10 minutes being like, this is stupid.
[58:48.57]You gotta take a break, man.
[58:49.63]Come back later.
[58:50.67]Yeah, I think I'll take a break.
[58:52.65]It's still treasure.
[58:53.21]Where?
[58:56.11]Pick it up.
[59:00.37]Where is it?
[59:00.83]Pick it up.
[59:08.10]Where is it?
[59:14.22]Um...
[59:17.06]It's in the hole.
[59:17.98]Can we get in there?
[59:20.40]Can I, like, knock into it?
[59:23.93]Hey, wait, it's this guy.
[59:28.01]Do you have something in there?
[60:06.38]OK.
[60:08.02]And what was in his hole?
[60:15.71]What's wrong with you?
[60:17.69]Somebody said to kill them so I can get in.
[60:19.69]There's something in this hole.
[60:20.63]It's the wrong one.
[60:39.54]Can I not get... Did he actually steal a treasure and I can't get in there?
[60:48.36]I have to kill them all.
[60:53.05]I have to kill all the bugs.
[60:57.99]Holy shit.
[60:59.29]Run away.
[60:59.67]They come out for food.
[61:14.92]So I have to kill a bug over here and leave the dead body?
[61:29.33]Kill the other one.
[61:30.33]Just kill the other bug.
[61:31.19]Okay.
[61:45.87]I don't like killing these guys.
[61:46.83]They're kind of cute and funny.
[61:58.20]Oh.
[62:00.80]Well.
[62:10.03]I didn't like doing that.
[62:11.07]I wasn't a fan of that.
[62:11.83]I don't want to kill them.
[62:13.75]They were not even hostile.
[62:25.92]Based.
[62:26.62]Based.
[62:27.96]Based.
[62:29.08]Based.
[62:31.51]Hello, my name is Jerma985.
[62:34.73]And what you just did there was totally based.
[62:43.34]Alright, we got it all?
[62:57.85]That was a podcaster voice?
[63:00.51]No, it's not a podcaster voice.
[63:02.09]This is a podcaster voice.
[63:13.24]I'll show you what a podcaster voice is.
[63:16.74]I'm going to fuck up all my settings.
[63:18.22]So let me just go to, hold on.
[63:23.01]I actually will mess this up and I won't be able to get it fixed ever again.
[63:26.27]Hold on, ready?
[63:31.58]Oh, shit.
[63:32.14]What did I do?
[63:37.43]Hold on.
[63:37.95]I want to make sure I don't screw this up.
[63:41.63]Okay, here's your podcaster voice.
[63:42.75]I have to take a screenshot of this.
[63:47.05]Because I'll fuck... Hold on.
[63:48.76]Okay.
[63:54.28]Here's your podcaster voice.
[63:57.94]So today we're going to be checking out... You know, I saw this new movie.
[64:01.02]I saw Infinity War.
[64:02.62]And I was seriously not a fan of it.
[64:11.98]I'm not sure what they were thinking with Thanos.
[64:14.46]I don't like him as a villain.
[64:20.29]I was more inclined to be happier with... You know... Doctor Dreadful.
[64:28.44]Yeah.
[64:31.07]The candy cartoon guy from the 80s.
[64:32.83]90s.
[64:33.43]He would have been so much more fun.
[64:42.85]Okay.
[64:43.33]Are we good?
[64:48.78]I think I'm... Am I back to normal?
[64:52.02]I hope.
[64:52.92]I hope I'm back to normal.
[64:53.96]More compressor.
[64:55.00]More compressor.
[65:00.10]Hold on, I need to print screen.
[65:01.18]I fucked it all up.
[65:03.67]Remember when I had a compressor like that on?
[65:05.33]And everybody freaked out.
[65:07.55]Everybody was so pissed off.
[65:09.97]They were like, Mike sucks.
[65:11.03]Fix your mic.
[65:11.73]What the fuck?
[65:12.25]This sounds terrible.
[65:12.99]And I'm like, I was so mad.
[65:17.94]No, this is correct.
[65:18.72]This is the way it was.
[65:20.70]Yeah, we're good.
[65:25.22]It wasn't that bad.
[65:26.08]I know it wasn't that bad, but if there's even a slight change in audio, people think that I'm streaming from inside of a bathtub.
[65:34.25]Alright, is this also electricity?
[65:46.49]Oh, there's a big Bunga Burger over here.
[65:47.79]Is that electric?
[65:50.75]Uh, alright, I gotta get... Guys!
[65:56.69]Guys, guys, guys, guys, guys.
[65:59.11]No, he ate one.
[66:03.85]Hurry, hurry.
[66:09.45]Ah.
[66:10.39]He's eating everybody.
[66:15.59]Shit.
[66:18.61]He got me into a corner.
[66:34.92]as Pikmin die that's part of the game the hundreds of Pikmin are gonna die over the course of a playthrough of this game like they're just dead they're gonna die hundreds of them
[66:58.63]Ooh, ice cream.
[67:08.08]Squish him.
[67:15.06]I can't go over there.
[67:16.36]Hmm.
[67:29.42]Alright, there's probably going to be a buried treasure.
[67:32.48]Anything else that I... Because I don't want to throw them over there and have all of a sudden like a Bunger Burger jump over here and try to kill me.
[67:41.16]Okay, there's a coffee mug.
[67:46.11]It looks to be safe, I think.
[67:47.77]Alright, I'm just making sure there's nothing else that's going to kill me.
[67:54.25]Alright, let's go.
[68:05.76]Okay.
[68:06.74]Uh, yellow, go on up there.
[68:19.92]Get it!
[68:27.15]When I was a kid, I didn't finish the first level in Pikmin because I didn't want any of them to die.
[68:33.70]That's so, that's so cute.
[68:36.14]That's like absolutely adorable.
[68:37.36]What you just said.
[68:37.80]That's so cute.
[68:39.98]Like, my God, you just like made my heart turn to like, you just melted it.
[68:46.03]That's so cute.
[68:46.87]That's the cutest thing I've ever heard.
[68:50.25]Where are they going?
[68:57.04]Why are they running over here?
[69:05.32]Remember, he was 30 when he played.
[69:07.90]So?
[69:10.19]Is he going to try to steal it?
[69:13.57]Kill him.
[69:24.22]Don't let him get it.
[69:34.38]So I have a question about the GameCube controls.
[69:35.98]How do you throw Pikmin with the GameCube controller?
[69:44.62]It's just the C stick.
[69:51.73]Alright, let's pick up some stuff.
[70:01.58]Go up here.
[70:02.41]Don't get stuck, man.
[70:03.11]You're going to get stuck.
[70:04.71]Come on.
[70:07.85]Is that it for the treasure?
[70:08.61]That is.
[70:08.89]Alright, cool.
[70:19.12]Isn't great, but better than motion controls when you get used to it.
[70:23.66]The motion controls are fine.
[70:24.60]I mean, I know I was like talking a bunch of shit and I was, you know, making a bunch of jokes.
[70:29.37]Motion controls are fine.
[70:31.35]It's, to be completely honest with you, it's just like having to hold the thing out like a remote control for a long period.
[70:40.93]You know what they didn't make, which they should have made?
[70:42.45]They should have made a Wii arm brace.
[70:47.38]Or as a device that you attach to the Wiimote and to your wrist and then anchored it to something.
[70:53.81]Like a cushion.
[70:55.19]Well, we arm anchor cushion.
[70:59.78]Where are the other two?
[71:00.32]There's one up here.
[71:08.64]Where's the other guy?
[71:13.88]Oh, back there.
[71:17.96]Bionic boomer.
[71:18.88]No.
[71:20.24]Look, it doesn't...
[71:22.05]The strongest man in the world could sit here with a Wiimote holding it up and his forearm would start to get tired and it wouldn't matter.
[71:30.73]You guys would still make fun of that guy.
[71:37.98]Where's this other one?
[71:39.86]Didn't I get him?
[71:48.39]There we go.
[71:58.16]Artie, the strongest man in the world, yeah.
[72:08.61]Artie!
[72:11.91]Strongest man in the world.
[72:15.35]That's the best character that was on that show.
[72:18.39]That might be the best character from any Nickelodeon show.
[72:23.11]I remember when Artie, for an entire episode, was trying to lift up Pete and Pete's house.
[72:31.49]And he did it.
[72:32.21]He lifted it like a tenth of an inch or something, right?
[72:44.28]The entire episode, he's sitting there like, I will do it.
[72:46.56]I will lift up your house.
[72:48.64]And
[72:50.92]He's sitting there holding the side of their... Like the vinyl siding in their house.
[72:56.96]Like the whole episode.
[73:01.92]Kill.
[73:03.92]Back up.
[73:07.28]Back up.
[73:11.61]Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me.
[73:12.89]Alright, back up.
[73:19.99]Back up.
[73:26.24]Back up.
[73:30.36]Back up.
[73:43.63]Back up.
[73:44.31]Oh, he's going to kill them.
[73:46.75]Let's close.
[73:49.92]Take his body.
[73:50.54]Alright.
[73:54.48]We got these guys to deal with too.
[73:58.67]I need one good shot.
[74:00.55]My arm.
[74:06.49]I got it.
[74:07.69]I did it.
[74:08.03]I did it.
[74:08.29]I did it.
[74:08.61]I did it.
[74:08.91]I did it.
[74:16.74]Throw the purple.
[74:17.50]That's what I'm doing.
[74:29.26]Oh, man.
[74:29.62]What I wouldn't get for a sea stick right now.
[74:34.89]You need to... Pay attention.
[74:38.75]Don't just look at the chat.
[74:42.26]Excuse me.
[74:42.56]Don't...
[74:57.89]Alright, we're good.
[74:59.43]Let's do treasure hunting.
[75:04.74]Should I get Thai or pizza?
[75:06.48]Get Thai.
[75:06.98]Get Thai food.
[75:17.11]Get a Thai pizza.
[75:18.65]You could do that.
[75:25.00]A good pad thai is... You can't be beat.
[75:27.62]Pizza's pizza.
[75:28.36]Yeah, pizza's pizza.
[75:33.13]You can have pizza.
[75:34.85]But, like, pizza's pizza.
[75:39.61]Um... I want some of you guys to get over here.
[75:43.53]In fact, all of you get over there.
[75:50.62]Because I want whoever has not drank to drink.
[76:05.24]Oh, I could have just, whatever.
[76:06.10]Alright, what's next?
[76:10.59]Uh, treasure got.
[76:12.81]Treasure get.
[76:16.85]All you eat is heal.
[76:18.65]I don't, no, I don't.
[76:26.72]Oh, fuck.
[76:29.96]This level's kind of hard.
[76:30.92]Ooh, that's a good thing to do.
[76:34.06]He's always aiming over here.
[76:37.64]I'm gonna do that.
[76:39.50]Stop shooting over here.
[76:42.52]Oh, I fucking... Okay, I gotta split up.
[76:46.96]I hope he doesn't aim over here.
[76:48.96]I need just a couple of purples.
[76:52.14]Come with me.
[76:52.50]See, this purple's very slow.
[77:02.25]Oh, shit.
[77:02.63]Come on.
[77:03.05]Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[77:09.78]Come on, hurry, hurry.
[77:14.34]Oh, my God.

[77:17.98]Oh, shit.
[77:19.52]Are we good?
[77:23.58]Come on, keep going.
[77:26.38]Yes.
[77:27.10]Good job.
[77:27.66]You did it.
[77:37.13]They will shoot only at me?
[77:39.77]Okay, now we have to deal with these guys.
[78:00.46]I think I'm safe if I just stay right here.
[78:03.44]Yeah, I'm safe if I stay here.
[78:08.53]That motherfucker just rolled it over here Back up back up back up back up back up everybody back up.
[78:14.54]Oh my god, please Dude I didn't think it was gonna roll that far I thought it was an explosion
[78:36.26]Oh my God, I have to reset the level.
[78:38.88]I thought it was, I didn't think it kept rolling that far.
[78:43.46]It rolled all the way down here.
[78:45.24]I lined him up.
[78:49.88]I was trying to get away, the yellows away.
[78:53.60]I thought it was, of course it hits this fucking edge.
[78:57.24]Oh God damn it, man.
[78:58.74]What a pain in the ass.
[79:02.46]I could have just ran.
[79:03.40]He just killed another one.
[79:04.80]I have to reset.
[79:12.19]I'm resetting.
[79:13.13]No, that was half of every Pikmin I own.
[79:22.52]Wait, what do you mean?
[79:24.50]No, no, no.
[79:25.50]Reset the whole console.
[79:30.29]That's not reset.
[79:31.15]Just turn the console off.
[79:34.97]Wait, what are you talking about?
[79:38.36]Just turn it off.
[79:39.38]Just turn off the console.
[79:41.76]So you're telling me if I turn off the console right now, I'll come back and be okay.
[79:50.95]Consequences.
[79:51.63]No, not when I lose half of every Pikmin I own.
[79:55.21]Okay, I'm turning off the game console.
[80:03.15]Here we go.
[80:07.15]I feel like this is bait.
[80:08.95]Is this bait?
[80:10.53]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[80:15.66]It's bait.
[80:16.44]Okay.
[80:16.92]Shit.
[80:18.22]Move out of the way.
[80:30.57]He just crushed somebody.
[80:34.31]I have a drink in the way.
[80:36.59]Oh my god.
[80:37.70]I hate this fucking console.
[80:54.73]It's not bait?
[81:02.40]It's not bait.
[81:03.10]Actually not bait.
[81:03.86]Okay, I'm doing it.
[81:04.63]I did it.
[81:04.93]I just turned it off.
[81:05.41]I turned the console off.
[81:08.41]I hope.
[81:08.65]I bet it better not be bait.
[81:09.83]I'd be really mad if it is.
[81:21.18]Look at Samara for a sec.
[81:21.84]You want to know something funny about the Wii U?
[81:34.16]Wii U, I think, has a slower startup time to get from go to game.
[81:39.28]Like, go into game, turn on console, then, like, an old hard drive from, like, 1998 to turn on Windows fucking 95 did.
[81:46.58]Like, it's a longer boot up time.
[81:47.78]It's a longer time to get into a game.
[81:58.65]...to the password for your Nintendo network ID.
[82:00.73]Oh my fucking god.
[82:02.86]Why do they even still have a network ID for Nintendo Wii U?
[82:05.86]I'm probably one of eight people that are on the fucking network right now.
[82:18.71]Alright, I'm coming back.
[82:23.88]TV only, please.
[82:28.54]Okay, here we go.
[82:29.82]Crying and screaming and farting.
[82:32.32]Beats to study.
[82:33.08]Wii U.
[82:51.08]your strap on where's the brace I want like a foam brace that I can stuck on here like a uh what's the thing that you like a sniper rifle if you're proning with a sniper rifle and you put out that thing on the front what's that thing called I want one of those for the wii a bipod that's right exactly that's what I want for the wii
[83:20.22]Holy shit.
[83:20.62]It worked.
[83:21.74]It was, I thought it was bait the whole time too.
[83:23.56]Holy shit.
[83:24.30]Nice.
[83:29.37]I honestly thought it was bait.
[83:31.87]Let me get comfortable again.
[83:35.41]Okay.
[83:36.25]Go.
[83:41.73]Alright.
[83:43.29]I did blue.
[83:52.67]Does anybody else have this problem, too?
[83:53.88]This might just be a me problem.
[83:55.60]But, like, holding up the Wii mode and pressing A with my thumb, like, after a while, starts to become, like, hard to do and, like, tiring.
[84:02.44]Does everybody else have that problem, too?
[84:13.12]I feel like the A button should have been more to the left or something.
[84:16.22]I don't know.
[84:19.01]Let me just find every way I can complain about, like, a beloved console that everybody loved.
[84:24.09]Except for me, apparently.
[84:35.00]Watch it.
[84:42.29]Alright, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[84:43.21]Move, move, move.
[84:45.13]These guys suck.
[84:51.06]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[84:53.04]Did we lose one?
[84:55.58]Okay, I lost one.
[85:02.01]Stop throwing him over there.
[85:03.35]Why is he throwing him that way?
[85:04.83]That's so unfair.
[85:20.47]Use my power up.
[85:21.35]Well, I have to fight like three of these guys.
[85:35.91]Kill that.
[85:38.65]Kill this guy.
[85:39.31]Shoot him.
[85:40.57]Shoot this guy.
[85:43.77]Shoot this Bunger Burger guy.
[85:48.95]shoot this he's gonna eat somebody thank you my god overwhelm him overwhelm doesn't he won't get to fire another shot holy that was horrible this place sucks
[86:19.48]Reset.
[86:19.86]You lost four or three.
[86:21.27]No.
[86:25.69]Hold A. Press B. Aim with Rebel Control's high heat sensor bar.
[86:48.78]Oh, you motherfucker.
[86:50.90]This console.
[86:52.06]Oh, my God.
[86:53.30]Let me shake my hand a little.
[87:11.91]They never intended anyone to play this console for more than fucking 20 minutes.
[87:14.93]They really didn't.
[87:16.37]I know they didn't.
[87:31.22]They even have a thing telling you to stand up and like take breaks every fucking 10 minutes.
[87:37.99]Like what the hell?
[87:38.81]Remember how many times that they showed you that screen?
[87:44.39]They were so hell-bent on making sure you didn't play for more than 20 minutes in a row.
[87:50.39]Remember, get up and stretch and don't knock over the fucking vase that's next to you.
[87:53.97]That's right next to your couch for some reason.
[87:59.67]Alright, I split this up.
[88:06.43]Scratch that drink that.
[88:07.54]And then VR happened.
[88:12.52]Yeah, that's true.
[88:16.28]The watch out this a vase next to your dining table or whatever or next to your next to your couch actually turned into people putting holes in their drywall by punching with VR.
[88:27.52]Now a VR Pikmin that I can get into.
[88:42.87]I was going to say that killed me.
[88:44.59]I was fucking turned off the stream.
[88:48.85]Shit.
[88:49.43]Hold on.
[88:51.93]How am I supposed to do this?
[88:54.97]Alright.
[88:55.47]Everybody back up.
[88:57.63]I'm going in here with like... Okay.
[88:59.15]Here's the plan.
[89:01.54]I'm going in here with just purples.
[89:06.20]And we're going... I'm going to split this up small.
[89:16.62]Is there even treasure over here?
[89:18.82]There is.
[89:19.14]Okay, this is... Wait, I have an idea.
[89:24.72]Move.
[89:25.88]I went over him.
[89:26.46]Oh my fucking god.
[89:28.85]What?
[89:34.39]This treasure... If I... I have an idea.
[89:42.56]If I stand in the way, just if I put the captains in the way and make them get hit by the balls...
[89:50.95]They can get the treasure, right?
[89:56.30]I'll just die?
[90:18.22]Move, move, move, move, move.
[90:23.66]Watch out, watch out.
[90:24.30]Where's he shooting?
[90:25.06]Back up.
[90:25.83]Turn him this way.
[90:26.47]What are you shooting at?
[90:27.25]Oh, fuck.
[90:50.01]Oh, fuck.
[90:57.55]He's almost dead.
[90:58.03]Just relax.
[91:05.12]Where's he shooting?
[91:05.60]That way?
[91:05.86]Alright, kill him.
[91:07.90]Good.
[91:08.44]Thank God.
[91:08.76]Alright.
[91:09.30]There's two more.
[91:09.98]You don't have to recall them when it tosses them.
[91:12.68]They run back towards you and the boulders just roll over them off the ramp.
[91:16.87]That's scaring me shitless, though.
[91:18.07]I don't know if I can handle that.
[91:21.43]Alright, there's nothing there.
[91:22.81]There's one here, though.
[91:23.65]This guy's gonna die over here.
[91:34.35]Oh, no!
[91:35.33]I left one.
[91:35.89]I left one.
[91:36.81]Accidentally killed that guy.
[91:39.43]Yes!
[91:39.87]Shoot him.
[91:45.12]Shoot this guy.
[91:50.59]You little asshole.
[91:51.43]Come here.
[91:57.11]Don't carry him.
[91:57.93]Run.
[91:58.73]What are you doing?
[92:00.09]What are you doing?
[92:01.25]Why would you try to pick him up?
[92:14.81]Run away!
[92:20.80]Run away from it.
[92:28.86]Alright.
[92:46.84]Collect.
[92:47.58]Collect the bounty.
[93:10.72]web web dev here what what is web dev what a Wii U dev here
[93:24.03]Is it?
[93:24.83]Wii... Wii... Wii... Wii U dev here.
[93:28.87]Look, I understand my consoles and their motion controls did not revolutionize the gaming industry the way we intended them to.
[93:34.12]But to sit here and watch you shamelessly bash my life's work... Who the fuck do you think you are?
[93:38.02]You know how many years I slaved away at Nintendo to bring you gaming experiences like this only for you to stab me in the back by calling them garbage?
[93:44.22]You should be ashamed.
[93:44.94]I never said that.
[93:47.87]I never said that.
[93:49.09]When did I... When did I say this was garbage?
[93:52.91]I didn't say that.
[93:57.94]I said I want a bipod.
[93:59.34]And if you had a bipod that was for sale, I would have had a much better experience.
[94:15.42]Yes, I want a tactical Wii mode.
[94:18.83]So I can just plant it on my arm.
[94:22.65]The chair of my arm.
[94:23.89]The arm of my chair.
[94:26.15]And just lock it in there and rest.
[94:28.37]And have a gyro there so I can move the wrist around.
[94:31.44]I did not say garbage.
[94:36.68]I did not.
[94:37.56]I did not say that.
[94:38.78]I know I didn't.
[94:42.73]I did not say garbage.
[94:49.90]Let me tell you exactly what I said.
[94:51.72]I said, in very direct quotes, fuck this console.
[94:58.26]I think that's what it was.
[94:58.98]I think.
[95:00.18]It was something like that, right?
[95:01.28]Now, I didn't say this console was garbage.
[95:02.78]I just said fuck this console.
[95:06.80]And fuck this controller, right?
[95:09.22]But that doesn't mean I don't like the game.
[95:12.58]I'm not having fun with the system.
[95:15.70]That's worse.
[95:16.24]No, it's not.
[95:28.91]that quote was very oh fuck somebody said in direct quotes I think I know whatever no the Wii U I alright I could tell you right now I don't give a shit about the Wii U
[96:01.76]The Wii was fantastic.
[96:03.02]It was very good back in like 2007.
[96:04.44]The Wii U is what they wanted the Switch so badly to be, but I guess they weren't ready to make it yet.
[96:17.97]They took the Wii U idea and how just how truly awful it was.
[96:23.84]And they made it the system they actually wanted to make with the Switch.
[96:28.44]And it's way better.
[96:37.82]So look, I'm going to have to give Nintendo some credit here with the Wii U being as messy and as fucked up and weird.
[96:45.72]And I hate to say the word bad as it was.
[96:50.89]If we didn't get the Wii U, we may not have gotten the Switch.
[96:54.67]And think of how good the Switch is.
[96:56.05]Think of how much, think of how awesome, think of how much you use the Switch.
[96:58.65]Think of how awesome that console really is.
[97:01.94]We wouldn't have gotten there without the stepping stone that was the Wii U.
[97:20.53]Never bought a Switch.
[97:22.97]I think it's great.
[97:23.57]Switch is awesome.
[97:26.25]It's everything I've ever wanted.
[97:27.19]Remember when the PSP came out and it was, oh my god, you're gonna get PlayStation quality graphics on the go!
[97:34.38]It was like, alright, okay, it was cool.
[97:37.44]It was my, I needed to go to the bathroom console.
[97:40.54]I used to bring my entire computer in to the bathroom.
[97:44.50]And I get the Switch now.
[97:45.84]The Switch is a full, actual 3D graphics of the same caliber.
[97:51.77]And he's telling me that's my bathroom.
[97:53.45]I can go to the bathroom with it.
[97:55.62]Best thing I've ever bought in my life.
[98:09.75]What's this ham doing over here?
[98:11.07]Why is it like a piece of pork belly?
[98:17.45]This guy's freaking me out.
[98:20.08]What's he doing?
[98:20.48]What are you doing?
[98:21.44]What are you doing?
[98:22.02]Get away from everybody.
[98:22.80]What are you doing?
[98:23.30]What's he doing over here?
[98:33.39]This guy, he's freaking me out.
[98:34.61]I don't like this floor.
[98:37.79]Somebody died?
[98:45.09]This is a very dangerous floor.
[98:49.93]Don't let him steal that.
[98:51.25]Whatever.
[98:51.63]There's a lot going on on this floor.
[98:57.76]He's stealing a plate.
[98:58.56]Give me that.
[98:59.16]That's not for you.
[99:00.64]That's not for you.
[99:02.14]Get that from him.
[99:02.90]That's not for you.
[99:04.26]That's not yours.
[99:06.10]That's not yours.
[99:06.76]Give it back.
[99:08.70]Don't let him take that.
[99:11.48]Put that down.
[99:13.16]Put it down.
[99:14.52]Put that shit down.
[99:17.44]Get over here.
[99:18.38]I want that plate.
[99:23.82]Oh, it's a piece of baloney.
[99:30.37]Meat of champions, it is.
[99:31.55]That killed him?
[99:35.11]Oh, he like touched the beam and it fucking insta-killed him.
[99:43.74]Were you just gonna take your friend?
[99:45.22]Alright, you have to die.
[99:46.96]I'm not gonna deal with that this whole room.
[99:48.70]No way.
[99:52.45]It would be nice if I could fucking land anybody on you.
[100:02.07]The big one is freaking me out though.
[100:08.16]Oh my god damn it man.
[100:18.80]I'm bracing every bone in my body to do this right now.
[100:24.49]Holding it right here, I'm using every bone in my body.
[100:36.56]I was just holding it into my chest to make sure it wasn't moving that much.
[100:39.14]Alright, everybody get over here.
[100:52.78]Bro, what the fuck?
[100:53.54]What?
[100:59.80]Okay, I got... Where's my other dudes?
[101:03.28]Oh, I'm missing somebody.
[101:04.10]Okay, here we go.
[101:04.60]Alright, there's an egg over here.
[101:07.96]Let's get that egg.
[101:11.98]Get that over here quickly before this guy takes it.
[101:14.54]I kind of like this level.
[101:15.22]It's like a breakfast level.
[101:15.96]Where you going?
[101:17.34]Where they going?
[101:19.62]Down?
[101:19.82]Not?
[101:19.90]Where you going?
[101:20.70]Where you going?
[101:23.81]And down this way.
[101:25.49]Thank you.
[101:41.86]That looks like a pretty good egg.
[101:46.95]Alright, in the chat, I want to know, over easy, over medium, or over hard?
[101:50.67]If you say anything besides over medium, you are banned from this channel.
[102:02.13]Well, looks like we're dropping a lot of people today.
[102:09.03]I love over medium.
[102:09.59]Over medium is perfect because it gives you this sort of gel, almost gelatin-like substance.
[102:14.93]I'll kill this guy.
[102:23.73]He's going to steal something.
[102:24.90]No, just get rid of what I was doing before.
[102:28.16]I need yellow.
[102:32.28]They're not hostile, so it's fine.
[102:41.03]Kill...
[102:45.33]Always over medium.
[102:46.33]Other 10 times it's actually made right.
[102:50.91]Actually, over medium is the hardest one to do.
[102:52.11]Because that's why it's the best one.
[102:56.49]Over medium is the most difficult egg to cook.
[103:00.60]People don't get it right.
[103:10.42]What about boiled eggs?
[103:11.18]Yep.
[103:13.54]I love hard boiled eggs, but here's the thing about hard boiled for me.
[103:17.84]I don't want soft boiled egg.
[103:19.48]I want a over medium egg, but I don't want a soft boiled egg.
[103:22.66]And you'd probably be confused saying, Jeremy, isn't a soft boiled egg exactly what you want?
[103:27.21]That is exactly an over medium style.
[103:29.77]And I'll say, yes, it is.
[103:30.95]But when it's a hard boiled egg, I want it to be solid.
[103:33.71]I don't want it to be drippy or gooey.
[103:36.76]I want to be solid.
[103:42.08]Read chat.
[103:42.60]What?
[103:43.42]He's stealing the treasure.
[103:46.48]Who is?
[103:49.30]Alright.
[103:49.64]I'm trying to get rid of the electricity.
[103:54.36]I'll get it back.
[103:56.96]Did somebody die?
[104:14.75]I can still get that treasure.
[104:15.57]I just have to kill him.
[104:23.47]Yeah, but over medium is my favorite type of, uh, like that style cooked on a skillet.
[104:29.31]Hard boiled.
[104:29.71]I like it to be fully cooked all the way.
[104:33.11]I really am not a big fan of that.
[104:35.69]We can go scrambled eggs here.
[104:37.77]I don't... I'm sorry.
[104:39.07]I don't like the scrambled egg that's... You put it in the pan for five seconds and you Ster it around and then it's done.
[104:45.43]No, no, no, no, no.
[104:46.23]That's like porridge.
[104:46.91]It's sludge.
[104:48.29]I like my scrambled eggs to be solid.
[104:51.64]I don't like the sludge porridge shit.
[104:53.32]I don't.
[104:53.66]I really don't.
[104:55.80]Okay, let's kill this guy.
[104:56.62]Alright, it's gotta be purple.
[105:02.22]I get it.
[105:09.63]I don't think he can even, can he even hurt anybody?
[105:11.50]Can he even attack?
[105:12.24]I don't, this is gonna take a while.
[105:32.03]He's not like the caterpillar from Mario, right?
[105:33.71]Like, eventually he's not going to freak out and start sprinting around and killing everybody.
[105:49.73]If I get him down to red health and he starts to sprint around, I'm going to freak out.
[105:52.70]Alright, split up.
[106:01.02]I need purple.
[106:12.55]Where's he going?
[106:20.41]He's walking like Squidward.
[106:22.01]What's that mean?
[106:29.13]Walking like Squidward.
[106:38.26]dead and he dropped a can of milk and a donut oh shit he had a lot of stuff processing how bizarre an item appears to have fallen out of the freakish creature must have been a greedy beast to swallow something like this probably
[107:01.81]We have a lot of... Yeah, this is why I didn't want to... Yeah, I'm good.
[107:09.45]Oh, right.
[107:11.15]Shit.
[107:11.59]We got WarioWare Smooth Moves on the Wii.
[107:15.52]It's like one of the best consoles.
[107:16.46]Never mind.
[107:17.90]Sorry, I put my drink down in front of the Wii Center bar.
[107:19.62]Fuck this stupid shitty console.
[107:20.84]Get the donut.
[107:29.67]Get the donut.
[107:36.76]Get a candle?
[107:37.58]No, I will burn my whole... I'll burn my entire room down.
[107:44.06]I don't like candles.
[107:47.34]I love candles, but I'm always afraid of having a candle in multiple rooms.
[107:53.97]Maybe some of you can level with me here.
[107:56.09]candle is great but I know people that put candles in a bunch of rooms you know there's a candle in the bedroom there's a candle in the living room there's a candle lit in the kitchen I want to be able to have an eyesight of that candle from anywhere that I'm going to be standing for the next hour I don't want no candle in a room I'm not going to be using absolutely not if I cannot see that candle it better be out
[108:26.21]It is far more advanced than the material I was researching.
[108:28.33]How frustrating.
[108:28.91]A spacesuit made from this wonder alloy could insulate the wearer from electric shocks.
[108:34.01]Oh, cool.
[108:35.29]I could walk through electricity.
[108:36.21]It's a hard word to say when you're just not prepared for it.
[108:39.15]This new material has allowed me to complete my anti-electrifier.
[108:43.47]It's my own invention with only the smallest iota of outside inspiration.
[108:57.20]Do you burn incense with your healing bracelets?
[109:00.20]Actually, I don't.
[109:03.02]I like essential oils, though.
[109:05.92]Not because I think they give me powers, but I just like the way tea tree oil smells.
[109:11.57]I just like the way tea tree smells.
[109:12.99]I like the way eucalyptus smells.
[109:15.37]I don't.
[109:15.59]It doesn't give me powers.
[109:17.05]I just like the way it smells.
[109:19.44]Cultist.
[109:25.58]No, I'm well aware that it doesn't do anything for me.
[109:28.26]Well, that's not true.
[109:30.20]Tea tree is actually really good for your hair.
[109:31.58]I mean, that's a good thing.
[109:35.52]It's good for your hair.
[109:37.68]It can relax you a little bit.
[109:38.60]Look, it's not going to do anything.
[109:39.64]It's not going to give you powers.
[109:40.93]What do you mean that's how it starts?
[109:48.01]Okay, well, if that's how it starts, like 15 years ago, I should have gone down the rabbit hole.
[109:52.31]I didn't.
[109:54.93]I thought tea tree smelled good and was cool when I was like 20.
[109:57.81]I don't, I didn't progress.
[110:02.81]Sweet dreamer.
[110:03.53]Did everybody drink?
[110:16.74]You look like a greasy today.
[110:26.56]That was pretty cool.
[110:28.18]I like the breakfast place.
[110:28.96]I didn't like the boulder bugs.
[110:36.14]That's $1,300.
[110:44.18]You're in an essential oils pyramid scheme.
[110:48.66]No.
[110:49.96]I bought a bottle of tea tree oil.
[110:54.16]I want to say...
[110:56.04]Maybe seven or eight years ago.
[110:59.74]But I still have it.
[111:01.52]It's still fine.
[111:03.18]I smell it sometimes.
[111:11.43]Day's almost over.
[111:12.07]We're good.
[111:12.41]Nobody's left out.
[111:14.59]Pretty good.
[111:14.99]That's a pretty good day.
[111:15.95]That's a pretty good day.
[111:16.59]$1,200.
[111:16.61]I signed up for this program.
[111:30.05]Where I get a bottle of tea... I get 10 essential oil bottles delivered to my door every month.
[111:35.87]And what you guys don't understand is... You could do this too.
[111:39.96]You could get it delivered to your door every month.
[111:41.74]And then you could bring 10 people and deliver them to 10 people's houses.
[111:45.18]And then those 10 people... Could have 10 other people.
[111:48.62]And 100 people would be underneath you.
[111:54.34]You know, years ago... Me and Burgah Boy would spend a lot of time together.
[112:02.60]We were going to try to get him to... And he wanted to do it too.
[112:05.54]We weren't trying to convince him or anything.
[112:08.68]We wanted to get him to do one of those MLM things and see how much money he could make going around trying to sell people stuff.
[112:17.79]It would be funny if you just tried.
[112:20.95]And he's like, yeah, that might be actually... Maybe that would be funny.
[112:24.87]Like, Burgah Boy shows up and is like, yeah, let me ask you a question.
[112:29.41]How's your skin care?
[112:36.20]And then like Burgah Boy ends up making like $50,000 a month doing it.
[112:42.88]Oh, wicked funny.
[112:52.96]No.
[112:55.62]A wicked funny pyramid scheme.
[113:01.69]We didn't do it.
[113:02.53]We just like joked about it.
[113:06.68]Olimar, you're my hero.
[113:07.68]You've erased half of our debt.
[113:09.18]Still, things have become a bit dangerous, so I'm going into hiding.
[113:11.94]Focus on work and don't slack off.
[113:15.96]What the hell are you doing?
[113:18.41]What is this?
[113:18.77]Why is the chat all hacked?
[113:21.03]Why is the chat hacked?
[113:24.41]How are you doing that?
[113:25.37]Don't do that.
[113:27.07]Why is it hacked?
[113:29.21]Oh, what the fuck is going on here? ...
[113:46.68]I don't even know what's going on over there but no uh the we were just talking about oh Burgah Boy like why don't you like get why don't you like join that like thing and if you're like I'm not fucking doing that stupid fucking scam take the red pill Jerma I don't know what the hell's going on is this some new program

[114:26.20]Don't do it.
[114:26.68]Take the blue pill and have a nice steak.
[114:37.24]I'm going back here.
[114:41.61]Look at all this other stuff I didn't do here.
[114:44.83]Have a good steak.
[114:53.97]He doesn't know what Unicode is.
[114:55.19]I don't know.
[114:57.37]I don't know.
[114:58.19]Okay, what do we got?
[115:14.12]We got... Let me take a quick look.
[115:17.72]What is here?
[115:19.29]We did this.
[115:22.07]We... Okay, I want more blue.
[115:23.67]What about over here?
[115:24.29]Up this way.
[115:25.77]Louie, investigate what's this way.
[115:27.91]If there's an electric fence over here, then... Fuck yeah.
[115:35.68]Hmm.
[115:36.76]Hmm.
[115:38.46]Hmm.
[115:40.32]What's down there?
[115:43.74]Secret?
[115:44.70]Secret treasure?
[115:45.24]Alright, there's nothing over here, Louie.
[115:47.55]I don't care.
[115:48.13]You can stay there for the rest of the level.
[115:49.31]I don't care.
[115:51.21]There's nothing over there.
[115:54.02]Go behind.
[115:54.46]Ooh, okay.
[115:59.99]This is nectar.
[116:01.85]Well, we actually kind of need it.
[116:02.77]Not yet, though.
[116:09.94]So what's the thing I haven't done here?
[116:14.92]Perfect Jupiters.
[116:15.54]Yeah, pretty good.
[116:27.59]What's up here?
[116:28.75]Don't fight this guy.
[116:29.55]I don't even need to.
[116:30.05]Alright.
[116:31.63]Is it, there's a cave.
[116:32.89]I think I've already, did I complete this cave?
[116:35.33]I completed this cave.
[116:37.37]So we got to go.
[116:37.93]Alright.
[116:38.21]I know where to go.
[116:39.03]Alright.
[116:39.89]Alright.
[116:41.11]Alright.
[116:42.19]Let's bring 25 blues.
[116:43.66]Let's pick, let's, let's spend a day collecting some Pikmin.
[116:46.88]What do you say?
[116:49.02]It's a lot of Jupiters right now.
[116:52.09]Hey, don't you know now's the opportunity?
[116:55.29]Now's the opportunity, guys, to put out like jermaTV, an emote that you'll never see.
[116:59.01]This is the opportunity to put out as many JermaTVs as you can put out.
[117:14.07]Well, hold on.
[117:14.49]Don't just start doing that.
[117:19.70]And we'll do some red.
[117:23.75]Let's say, uh, 15 red.
[117:28.65]Then purple.
[117:29.65]What do we got now?
[117:35.80]Some white.
[117:40.44]And then the rest will do blue.
[117:42.62]No.
[117:43.90]Yellow.
[117:48.50]30 yellow, and that leaves us with... Oh, get some red too.
[117:51.06]Why not?
[117:52.64]First of all, I need blue.
[117:55.86]Blue.
[117:56.98]Go get this.
[118:00.62]We need more of you.
[118:03.98]Put it in your thing.
[118:07.92]I need blue.
[118:10.15]There's a couple more flowers over here.
[118:11.31]I'm just doing some Pikmin collection.
[118:12.81]I'm doing some Pikmin utility here.
[118:20.18]Okay, grab that.
[118:22.16]That's blue.
[118:26.78]Grab this one too.
[118:33.13]Blue.

[118:35.03]We're on 10-year slow mode.
[118:37.33]Go ahead and get it.
[118:43.15]Gone.
[118:45.17]Bring it to blue.
[118:49.29]Did I take a break yet?
[118:50.51]No, I haven't.
[118:52.31]We probably will take a first break here in a little bit.
[119:01.26]After this level, I will.
[119:04.00]You literally won't.
[119:06.25]Why do you think I'm not going to take a break?
[119:15.47]No break.
[119:20.51]No, don't bring that over to yellow.
[119:21.73]What are you, dumb?
[119:27.37]$25,000 slow mode.

[122:49.10]And speaking of big streams, maybe we'll see you on March 6th.
[122:56.16]For the archaeology stream.

[126:04.15]Good.
[126:11.19]This is where it gets a little intense.
[126:18.51]And.
[126:28.64]Holy shit, that could have been really bad.
[126:32.89]Why is it curving?
[126:34.45]Why are they curving?
[126:44.35]Why are they curving?
[126:48.09]Why is it curving?
[126:54.33]They're homing?
[126:55.21]That's unbelievable.
[126:58.55]I'm just trying to get out of the way.

[127:17.98]Oh my God.
[127:26.12]Get him down.
[127:34.06]What?
[127:35.40]It's already midnight?
[127:36.24]Can I get up there?
[127:43.29]How do I get up here?
[127:44.45]Oh, bridge.
[127:59.52]Stop bringing that back.
[128:02.42]Alright, I got 88.
[128:04.67]Let's go.
[128:12.47]Another cave discovered.
[128:13.53]Venturing to the farthest reaches has proven rewarding.
[128:18.97]You may be tired of walking, but just one last leap remains now to get that treasure.
[128:22.57]I don't have enough.
[128:36.62]I don't have any white.
[128:39.44]Do I even have any white?
[128:40.26]Alright, we're coming back here and getting that crown tomorrow.
[128:45.96]How many white do I have?
[128:51.87]I'm going to try it.
[128:53.35]How many white do I have?
[128:54.57]I only have like three white Pikmin.
[129:07.92]I think we're safe for non-subs to come back.
[129:09.56]Bring them back.
[129:10.48]Let's see.
[129:10.80]Let's see if they'll behave.
[129:18.64]Alright.
[129:20.62]Where are we?
[129:21.06]There's purple.
[129:26.22]Snow.
[129:26.62]What do I want to replace for purple?
[129:31.36]Everybody line up.
[129:31.98]What do we got?
[129:35.00]I have a lot of blue.
[129:36.14]I think I'm going to do blue.
[129:42.61]This might be a mistake.
[129:50.93]This cave's scary.
[129:51.85]This cave sucks.
[129:52.55]This cave's hard.
[129:54.41]Well, let's see if I get wiped.
[130:00.44]Here comes a difficulty chat.
[130:02.22]Difficulty spike.
[130:04.62]Aw, damn it.

[131:33.65]I just, I got it.
[131:34.85]Okay.
[131:35.24]I think that's funny, but I have to stop doing that.
[131:38.76]There's going to be a huge Pikmin fan.
[131:40.40]That's going to see that and be like, why did he hate it so much?
[131:44.36]Why is he such a dick?
[131:45.42]I don't understand.
[131:45.96]Like, why would he be like that?
[131:47.12]Okay.
[132:02.59]Come back.
[132:03.73]Come back.
[132:04.05]Come back.
[132:04.33]Come back.
[132:04.61]Come back.
[132:04.89]Come back.
[132:05.17]Come back.
[132:05.49]Come back.
[132:05.75]You ate one.
[132:06.35]You fucking ate one.
[132:18.24]Crush him.
[132:19.12]Overwhelm him.
[132:19.62]Alright, he lost his...
[132:28.75]These corridors are so tight.
[132:30.39]These corridors are so small.
[132:33.31]Alright, this buried treasure here.
[132:46.46]I hope I have a white Pikmin to dig this.
[132:49.38]I do.
[132:57.02]I'll get it.
[133:01.86]You know, I wish if when I pressed C to go to Louie, I didn't, I wasn't still attached to everybody.
[133:08.32]It's kind of annoying.
[133:08.96]Like, I just want to be Louie.
[133:15.25]I don't want to be Louie and bring the whole crew.
[133:17.31]Alright.
[133:28.85]Get that diamond.
[133:31.04]Nice.
[133:37.67]The third game fixes that?
[133:39.09]Oh.
[133:43.31]This boss killed my entire squad.
[133:45.13]Good luck.
[133:45.65]Great.
[133:47.07]That doesn't sound good.
[133:50.39]Only 70 for a Ruby?
[133:56.77]There's a noob in the chat.
[133:58.61]Oh, please.
[134:12.83]This game's not easy.
[134:13.73]This game's not easy.
[134:16.35]Don't let anybody tell you that.
[134:19.09]It is.
[134:19.33]It's pretty easy, is it?
[134:21.01]This game is made for children.
[134:42.01]This game was made for children like 15 years ago.
[134:44.82]It's different.
[134:48.62]They made children's games hard 15 to 20 years ago.
[135:07.41]See, if Pikmin were to be made now, there would be a Pikmin generator that I would just go to the pause menu and just spawn another red Pikmin, as many as I wanted.
[135:26.65]You think Nintendo would not put that in nowadays?
[135:29.14]If you lose the same Mario level three or four times, it will beat the game for you.
[135:33.76]You don't think there'll be a Pikmin generator in the menu?
[135:37.26]In 2020?
[135:37.36]2021?
[135:37.38]Further into the depths.
[136:02.91]Easy.
[136:03.23]Why are games so easy?
[136:06.13]I didn't say that.
[136:06.75]I still have trouble.
[136:08.03]Look, I've been Luigi'd plenty of times in the new games.
[136:14.62]You want to know why I've never played Super Mario 3D World, really?
[136:17.14]Or Super Mario, new Mario Brothers Wii, whatever.
[136:20.04]A lot of people have said, oh, you should play that.
[136:22.52]Because I know for a fact that I'm going to get Luigi'd a bunch of times.
[136:25.34]And it's going to be Omega Lulz in the chat.
[136:27.52]Luigi'd.
[136:29.36]Bad streamer got Luigi'd again.
[136:32.20]I know it's going to happen.
[136:33.96]So that's why I'm just like, I don't want to play that.
[136:36.20]I'm scared to play it.
[136:37.02]I'm scared to get Luigi'd like more than like the quota that I'm allowed of like three.
[136:43.47]Okay.
[136:44.25]This level sucks.
[136:46.65]Okay.
[136:48.83]What do I do about this?
[136:49.89]I have to, I'm going to wake this guy up.
[136:54.53]Can I get them to shoot each other?
[136:55.44]I'm going to try this.
[136:57.18]I'm going to do a tactic here.
[137:02.41]Everybody stay back here with me and Louie.
[137:05.43]Don't come in here.
[137:07.05]No, he's going to shoot it right down this lane and kill everybody.
[137:11.37]Oh, my God.
[137:12.25]He actually did it.
[137:12.98]No, he didn't.
[137:13.36]Alright.
[137:13.62]Just go, go, go, go, go.
[137:14.66]Run.
[137:14.84]Why are you still with me?
[137:15.76]I did see.
[137:16.76]Get out of here.
[137:22.70]Shoot him.
[137:27.47]Good.
[137:27.95]Do it again.
[137:31.14]Good.
[137:31.72]It worked.
[137:32.22]Now shoot each other.
[137:43.01]Oh.
[137:46.71]Damn it.
[137:46.97]Alright.
[137:47.97]Come on.
[137:48.19]Get him.
[137:49.03]Get him.
[137:51.10]Yes.
[137:52.52]Yes.
[137:59.68]Wrap it back around.
[138:03.89]Alright, now kill him.
[138:09.79]Good.
[138:10.77]Now come this way.
[138:21.06]Let him shoot.
[138:23.50]Damn it.
[138:24.44]Yeah, I gotta spin him around.
[138:27.30]Punch with A. Yeah, that'll do like no damage.
[138:38.70]I need to move this out of the way.
[138:43.26]Punch him to death.
[138:44.78]I guess I... I'm fine.
[138:57.45]He's gonna... Okay.
[138:58.71]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[138:59.87]I ain't gonna have this happen.
[139:06.18]Fuck.
[139:06.48]This is a horrible position to be in.
[139:07.76]Alright, here we go.
[139:08.24]I'm going to let him walk away.
[139:10.62]There we go.
[139:11.50]Thank you.
[139:15.60]Now I'll be able to get him.
[139:27.61]Turn this way.
[139:28.17]Okay.
[139:49.64]Yes, yes, yes, yes!
[139:52.88]Yes!
[139:57.66]Yes, yes!
[140:07.45]Don't let him eat you!
[140:10.71]Yes!
[140:13.11]What is that?
[140:13.99]Is that from something?
[140:18.80]Alright, it's now safe.
[140:22.90]It's Captain Falcon.
[140:24.12]Yeah.
[140:25.76]Yes, it is.
[140:26.54]Okay.
[140:27.32]I was just curious.
[140:28.22]Alright.
[140:32.98]Get the spoils of war.
[140:58.85]soundboard f-zero gx on stream I don't understand f-zero I just don't everybody talks so highly of f-zero f-zero oh my god f-zero captain falcon is so cool nobody actually cares about that game
[141:27.98]Like, why don't they make one?
[141:31.75]Why does anybody... I feel like people talk so highly of, like, Captain Falcon and F-Zero, but I don't think anybody plays it.
[141:36.35]And they, like, won't make a new game or anything.
[141:44.26]It's not even nostalgia.
[141:45.48]It's, like, a new generation of, like, kids think he's cool.
[141:50.66]He is cool.
[141:51.88]He's really cool.
[141:52.52]Why don't they just make another one?
[141:57.17]Oh, it doesn't even need a racing game.
[141:58.27]Make, like, a Captain Falcon adventure game where you walk around and punch people and stuff.
[142:01.19]Like, people would eat that up like crazy.
[142:02.73]Do I not have enough to get this?
[142:20.24]Shit.
[142:20.92]Is it yellow back here?
[142:28.87]I think there's enough yellow.
[142:29.63]Yeah.
[142:50.52]There's a ramp here.
[142:51.47]I literally was blending in with the ground.
[142:53.35]I couldn't see it.
[142:59.14]It's a present too.
[143:11.23]The football, the Super Bowl is on.
[143:13.01]Oh.
[143:15.02]Oh, um, I don't know.
[143:22.94]The Super Bowl.
[143:34.29]Welcome to the Super Bowl.
[143:35.67]It's me, John Madden.
[143:48.82]It's like I'm there.
[143:52.44]Is that all the treasure?
[143:53.52]Yeah.
[144:06.56]Alright, who is it going to win?
[144:07.83]Hey, no, I won't be.
[144:09.59]I definitely won't be alive when the Super Bowl is over.
[144:11.51]I was going to do a prediction for it, but I'm not going to be live.
[144:15.11]When the Super Bowl is ending, so it'll be wasted points.
[144:22.82]OK, let's assess what's going on here.
[144:27.58]There is a white flower.
[144:29.04]I good thing there's a white flower I need to replace.
[144:34.03]Hmm.
[144:35.57]I don't know.
[144:36.15]I seem to yellow probably, right?
[144:37.53]I don't know.
[144:38.69]I have an equal amount of pretty much everybody.
[144:44.47]Don't get it yet.
[144:45.39]Do it at the end.
[144:49.92]Okay.
[144:52.76]Well, we have fire.
[144:53.56]Let's get rid of the fire.
[144:55.48]I'm going to say, alright, we've got multiple things to deal with here.
[144:58.06]Louie, Louie, you take fire.
[145:03.46]You know what else I don't like about this video game?
[145:06.06]Walking into Pikmin collects them.
[145:09.41]Unbelievable.
[145:11.45]Unbelievable.
[145:12.05]Okay.
[145:14.15]And then... What are they doing over here?
[145:20.39]Oh, my God.
[145:20.75]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[145:24.18]Run.
[145:24.50]Don't fight.
[145:24.98]Run.
[145:26.22]I hope there's nothing getting... I picked the one hallway that didn't have anything.
[145:29.56]Okay.
[145:29.80]Turn around.
[145:32.97]And get him.
[145:43.54]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[145:45.82]Get back here quick.
[145:48.10]They're blocked.
[145:49.24]Oh, my God.
[145:49.72]You're being blocked.
[145:55.13]Fucking land on him.
[145:56.33]Oh, my God.
[146:00.81]I thought they were dead.
[146:03.50]Gee, is there anybody still alive in his ass?
[146:09.18]Like, what the fuck?
[146:19.27]That was so... Alright, that was horrible.
[146:23.07]Okay.
[146:24.39]We're good.
[146:27.46]That was horrible.
[146:28.28]They were pursuing us.
[146:29.56]They came for us.
[146:32.25]I don't, I hate those ones.
[146:33.85]They actually actively come get you.
[146:39.56]120.
[146:39.58]That was inside of his danger chime.
[146:42.52]Okay.
[146:46.66]66 though.
[146:49.26]Okay.
[146:49.82]So what was I doing?
[146:50.78]Right.
[146:51.40]I was in the middle of trying to plan my, what I was going to do.
[146:55.22]So let's blurt it out.
[146:58.44]I'm going to take electricity with Olimar.
[147:02.96]Okay, electric Olimar.
[147:07.14]Louie, you... Louie, you need to spread these guys out and get red.
[147:15.47]I'm like right next to the microphone.
[147:16.87]I'm sorry.
[147:18.37]Okay.
[147:20.13]Olimar, yellow.
[147:21.93]Alright.
[147:22.97]It's time.
[147:24.19]Fire first.
[147:25.05]Louie, go.
[147:26.17]My elbow is red.
[147:30.14]I need one of those bionic arms.
[147:34.61]Shit, here comes like another invasion.
[147:38.47]Get out of here.
[147:52.31]What happened?
[147:52.71]A confused Bulborb has fallen in with the Pikmin.
[148:00.89]They appear to coexist peacefully.
[148:02.77]Wait, what?
[148:04.33]Did I just kill one for no reason?
[148:07.57]Strange.
[148:08.01]This Bulborb has a leaf sprouting from its spine, much like the leaf on a Pikmin's head.
[148:14.13]Oh, they went friendly.
[148:16.60]Well... Oh, no.
[148:22.70]That was a leader.
[148:23.94]That was a big one.
[148:24.86]I love the little Bulborbs.
[148:29.62]I love them so much.
[148:35.48]I love them.
[148:36.32]They're my favorite.
[148:39.14]They must be protected at all costs.
[148:40.70]Okay.
[148:44.30]Yellow.
[148:44.62]Let's go up here and just do this.
[148:45.82]There's gas up there.
[148:46.68]Attack.
[148:58.85]Kill everything.
[149:01.97]Excellent.
[149:03.75]Excellent.
[149:09.98]They can't die?
[149:10.66]Really?
[149:18.43]Alright.
[149:19.09]And there's the way to go down lower.
[149:20.41]Don't want to do that yet.
[149:23.53]I do appreciate the haunted house exit though.
[149:26.50]I do.
[149:26.94]Just in case you don't want to do it.
[149:31.24]The guy that's standing at the door in the black jumpsuit.
[149:35.28]It's like all the screaming, crying kids run out that way before the really scary stuff.
[149:39.77]I'm really glad it's there.
[149:44.63]By the way, I just want to let you know.
[149:45.59]I have had to use the escape haunted house exit one time in my whole life.
[149:54.49]And all I remember was crying buried into my father's chest while he was holding me.
[150:01.71]I was like probably six or seven.
[150:05.74]I was crying and just seeing the guy go right this way, right this way.
[150:10.60]And we just went outside into the air.
[150:14.93]That's all I remember.
[150:16.57]I don't remember anything else.
[150:20.23]Okay.
[150:20.45]Electricity all gone.
[150:23.23]It is.
[150:23.45]Alright, we need the gas.
[150:32.89]Okay, everybody stay.
[150:33.91]I need more white.
[150:36.53]No!
[150:36.79]Fuck the Wiimote.
[150:52.28]Get it.
[150:56.62]Put the Bulbman in the white flower?
[150:58.10]No way.
[151:00.54]Can I take them out to the surface?
[151:03.98]If I can take them to the surface, I'm not going to do that.
[151:08.60]I can't take them out to the surface?
[151:10.08]What?
[151:12.48]Oh, come on now.
[151:13.62]Really?
[151:14.68]That's really unfortunate.
[151:20.32]That's horrible.
[151:25.06]Alright, let's go get everybody.
[151:25.88]We're ready to move.
[151:27.08]The fire is up there, but I don't need... Unless there's a hidden one somewhere?
[151:33.36]They're immune to everything.
[151:34.38]Is there... Let's see.
[151:38.00]Just use them while you have them.
[151:43.17]Okay.
[151:43.27]What is it?
[151:46.81]A pen?
[151:47.07]Oh, it's a candle.
[151:52.54]There actually is.
[151:54.74]There is something buried.
[151:55.70]Okay.
[151:58.00]We got to get it.
[151:58.48]Everybody come over here.
[152:12.76]Okay.
[152:13.16]So I should throw the Bulbasaur in there.
[152:19.59]Use them while I have them.
[152:24.35]Don't I'm seeing a lot of conflicting data here.
[152:30.27]They're invincible.
[152:31.15]Don't.
[152:34.74]Okay.
[152:34.86]Well then I'm going to throw blue.
[152:54.64]Okay.
[152:54.96]76.
[152:55.88]Let's go.
[152:59.45]Can they drink the nectar?
[153:07.85]Oh!
[153:12.06]Bite!
[153:17.02]We good?
[153:18.70]Okay, we're good.
[153:24.21]Take the cupcakes.
[153:29.19]Those bugs freak out.
[153:30.73]Yeah, they do.
[153:32.85]Alright.
[153:33.41]It's time to go and try to find this one that's buried.
[153:41.82]Money, money, money.
[153:43.40]Butter, butter, butter fills the bowl.
[153:46.66]We're making us a cake that you've never seen before.
[153:49.22]We're making us a cake that you've lived before.
[153:53.10]Heat up the oven.
[153:53.90]Now we're on a roll.
[153:55.40]Heat up the oven.
[153:56.16]Now on a roll.
[153:58.44]Cheep, cheep, cheep's the name of your soul.
[154:00.92]Cheep, cheep, cheep.
[154:01.68]Cheep, cheep, cheep, cheep.
[154:05.56]Where's this last one?
[154:14.01]And it's bedweed.
[154:16.51]Where is it bedweed?
[154:19.51]It's bedweed over here.
[154:29.14]Thanks for joining me, everybody.
[154:30.59]Hope you're having a good day.
[154:31.41]Hope you're having a Sunday.
[154:32.69]Super Bowl Sunday.
[154:33.39]Hope you got yourself a slice of pizza.
[154:35.05]And a big Subway sub.
[154:38.29]The big ones.
[154:38.83]The comically large ones.
[154:44.86]Oh, I don't like Subway.
[154:45.74]Subway's terrible.
[154:48.68]Whatever.
[154:48.94]A chain that you like.
[154:49.68]Ooh, this would be worth a lot.
[154:56.82]Get that treasure.
[155:04.38]Stop saying dumbass things.
[155:10.18]I'm pretty much like 90% sure that at least half the time that I open my mouth on this stream, it's to say a dumbass thing.
[155:19.47]So if you don't like that kind of content, I suggest you go watch the Super Bowl.
[155:26.75]That's on right now.
[155:41.92]don't you know it's 50 stuff that you say in the shower when you know no one's listening to you 25 interesting true statements and then like 20 noises
[156:04.99]That's kind of how the stream works.
[156:09.44]I'm here for the true... Yeah, I got to give myself some credit, you know?
[156:11.94]Yeah, you're here for like 20% interesting statements.
[156:17.00]I got to give myself at least 20%.
[156:20.73]Wait, whoa, whoa!
[156:22.51]What did I just do?
[156:23.43]What happened?
[156:23.91]I went out?
[156:25.19]I went out the Halloween exit.
[156:30.13]Oh, no!
[156:41.06]Should I reset it?
[156:42.38]Oh, come on.
[156:43.10]I just was ready.
[156:44.10]No, I can't.
[156:46.22]I don't... What the fuck?
[156:54.88]Oh, no.
[156:56.60]I'll just go back and do it again.
[156:58.00]I made a lot of money.

[160:13.08]You would not like me as your dad.
[160:15.62]You would be listening to this from the other room.
[160:17.86]And be incredibly embarrassed.
[160:20.86]You would have friends over.
[160:22.90]And you'd be doing whatever you're doing.
[160:24.58]Hanging out in your room.
[160:25.40]And you would hear like.
[160:26.12]Oh look at me.
[160:27.05]The Wii is a piece of shit.
[160:29.23]This thing sucks.
[160:29.95]Fuck you.
[160:30.57]You'd hear that.
[160:31.03]And it would be like embarrassing to have friends over.
[160:36.71]You would make sure that on stream days.
[160:38.79]You were far away from this house.
[160:42.52]I'm not sure you would like that.
[160:43.46]Okay.
[160:44.48]So now I'm going to go back to that cave.
[160:50.51]My dad's a streamer.
[161:02.97]You know, I'm actually kind of surprised that like Nickelodeon or the Disney channel has not done that.
[161:09.25]Like my dad's a streamer.
[161:12.83]And they play like the handful of guitar riffs before the intro starts.
[161:16.05]And the person sits down.
[161:16.77]They're like, oh, man.
[161:18.85]It's so crazy living in this house.
[161:20.97]And they introduce all the characters.
[161:25.73]My dad, the streamer.
[161:27.19]You'll see.
[161:28.03]It'll happen.
[161:31.55]They did that with iCarly.
[161:32.76]Yeah, but that's not my dad, the streamer.
[161:34.96]That's iCarly.
[161:39.44]Wait, was iCarly's dad a streamer?
[161:44.81]My dad's a V tuber.
[161:53.28]My dad, the V tuber.
[162:01.38]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[162:02.58]It would be like my digital family and they all have their own little like avatars.
[162:12.42]That's real.
[162:14.93]What do you mean that's real?
[162:18.88]Disney Channel has that?
[162:19.90]There's a VTuber family that's a TV show?
[162:28.34]What?
[162:28.60]Okay, I have to play the game.
[162:32.23]I gotta go.
[162:36.47]That's an actual show?
[162:38.03]There's treasure somewhere over here.
[162:42.35]Where is it?
[162:45.27]Dude, dude, dude.
[162:47.29]There's treasure here.
[162:48.95]Dude.
[162:51.21]It's up there, I think.
[162:51.87]I'm going to throw some whites up there.
[162:57.53]It's red.
[162:57.93]Dude, it's definitely right there.
[162:58.85]Nice.
[163:19.11]What is it?
[163:20.71]Dig it out already.
[163:24.65]My dad, the VTuber.
[163:31.48]Oh, onion.
[163:32.54]Onion ring.
[163:35.26]You made mustard cheese dip?
[163:36.42]That sounds actually pretty good.
[163:41.14]Don't.
[163:41.34]They're going to go in the water.
[163:43.50]You see that?
[163:45.73]Okay, well, good thing I caught that.
[163:48.74]Come this way.
[163:55.60]The great reveal.
[163:57.16]That was supposed to be very scary, but I... And now I know it's there.
[164:08.21]I just think of Donkey Kong.
[164:15.65]Alright, I need purples.
[164:20.88]That's not Toad.
[164:21.48]That's the bird from Donkey Kong.
[164:25.02]Come on up.
[164:26.06]Show yourself.
[164:27.36]He's like right here.
[164:30.05]There you are.
[164:36.91]Shit.
[164:37.17]Oh, he ate a poison one.
[164:37.91]Good.
[164:43.63]That's good.
[164:43.99]Watch out.
[164:44.85]It's okay.
[164:45.15]Alright.
[164:45.39]Get off.
[164:52.96]Get back up.
[164:53.87]Where is he?
[164:58.33]No, no, no, no, no.
[164:58.97]Stop eating them.
[165:05.23]Why is nobody attaching to him?
[165:16.26]Why?
[165:17.76]What the fuck is going on?
[165:19.76]How am I missing?
[165:20.56]I can't reach him from here then.
[165:25.14]Oh my god, this Wiimote.
[165:30.30]I seriously feel like somebody's strangling me right now with their hands around my neck trying to aim this.
[165:43.19]I can't even... Nobody can even reach there.
[165:45.71]Nobody can actually... I can't throw anybody over there.
[165:50.95]Aim for the head?
[165:51.51]I'm trying to.
[165:52.09]Hold on.
[165:52.29]Ah!
[165:53.75]Let me aim over there hold on Dad
[166:21.04]Dad, shut up.

[166:36.94]Stop, please.
[166:38.00]Please don't do this right now.

[166:53.62]Oh my God, maybe I'm gonna lean in.
[166:56.27]Oh wow, she looks, I'm gonna have my first kiss.
[166:59.21]What the heck, oh my God, my heart is going crazy.
[167:02.27]What was that?
[167:05.49]What was that, did you hear that?
[167:09.37]I don't know, I must have dropped something on his foot.
[167:17.75]My dad the streamer.
[167:29.02]You need to give your kid the talk?
[167:38.23]Like on stream?
[167:46.30]For content?
[167:48.92]That's not, that would be not, that would be terrible.

[174:44.35]It's not for you.
[174:47.57]How many of you have Pokémon installed on your Switch right now or your Wii or something?
[174:51.75]How many of you guys play Pokémon?
[174:53.45]How many?
[174:56.71]How many of you guys are over the age of 18 that can't wait for the next Pokémon game to come out?
[175:04.11]But I can't watch an episode of Drake and Josh when I'm 20.
[175:06.02]Okay.
[175:13.95]But that's not for you, though.
[175:16.64]They make that game for a younger audience.
[175:18.56]You can't play that.
[175:20.86]Right?
[175:22.96]Right, guys?
[175:27.20]Wait, what am I doing?
[175:28.39]Continue.
[175:29.41]What did I just do?
[175:31.65]Did I not save the game?
[175:32.59]Alright, we're going back.
[175:47.48]Hey, I'm playing Pikmin right now, and you're here watching Pikmin.
[175:52.20]What does that make both of us?
[175:55.62]You're not allowed to play something because it was made to have a general audience in mind?
[176:04.27]Excuse me?
[176:04.67]What's wrong with that?
[176:06.71]I only have two blues.
[176:11.14]We gotta change that.
[176:27.36]Is there any bigger ones out here?
[176:28.68]I don't think so.
[176:39.09]Listen, like Pikmin, okay, cute does not mean only for children.
[176:43.93]Like, look, Pikmin, Olimar, look, it's like a cute game with, like, Pikmins.
[176:48.07]And they're so cute, and so, look at them.
[176:49.41]They're just like, oh.
[176:53.53]What, only children can play this?
[176:57.90]That's not fair.
[177:08.88]I want at least like six or seven.
[177:15.70]Wait, so you're not a child?
[177:17.54]No, I just act like one.
[177:21.52]Doesn't make me a kid.
[177:33.43]I'm just a little kid that is wearing this suit.
[177:39.00]I'm wearing this suit, glasses.
[177:41.62]Like a nice pair of loafers.
[177:43.46]As a joke.
[177:44.72]In whatever movie or TV show you're watching.
[177:46.62]We're like, oh no, the kid's gotta be an adult.
[177:49.25]He's doing taxes.
[177:54.61]Alright, so I got enough blue, I think.
[177:58.23]I do need a bunch of red.
[177:59.03]I need white.

[178:21.61]This one.
[178:23.21]So let's supplement that with a little bit more, more yellow.
[178:34.47]Okay, I have a ton of yellow.
[178:37.29]This is a yellow run.
[178:38.47]Alright, let's go.
[178:39.95]Who needs nectar?
[178:52.54]Drink it.
[178:56.03]I want you to be big and strong.
[178:59.67]Hit the bong on camera.
[179:00.80]I don't have a bong.
[179:01.70]I don't smoke weed.
[179:03.66]I eat it.
[179:05.20]If I need to.
[179:06.06]If I feel like it.
[179:06.72]Or if I want to.
[179:08.37]I do not really smoke it.
[179:09.99]It irritates my throat.
[179:11.29]Just going to be completely honest with you.
[179:13.23]I don't like to smoke weed because I feel like it's an irritant.
[179:15.41]It's an irritant.
[179:28.89]I love that snowman.
[179:29.51]It's so cute.
[179:32.89]Okay, we dealt with that bird last time.
[179:35.29]Now, we got this bridge.
[179:38.35]We went over here.
[179:40.23]There was that fence.
[179:42.81]Where was that fence?
[179:45.21]Up this way.
[179:47.65]There we go.
[179:48.31]Okay.
[179:48.95]Oh, there it is.

[180:33.66]Oh shit, I did.
[180:34.22]More than that.
[180:40.06]Did I get them?
[180:46.52]They just won't cross the bridge because they're dumb.
[180:48.03]What's your favorite bug?
[180:52.71]One of those big emperor beetles.
[180:54.29]Whatever they're called.
[181:02.01]ones with the gigantic faces they have the long noses the long jaws they have the big twig face what are they called Hercules beetle yep that's one I if a Hercules beetle was on my floor right now I would not freak out the bigger the bug the less scared I will be of it
[181:25.67]If a Hercules beetle walked into this room right now, I would not get up and go, oh my god, what the fuck is that?
[181:31.15]No.
[181:31.59]I'd be like, holy shit, that's a Hercules beetle.
[181:33.64]This is cool.
[181:36.06]If a spider as big as my thumbnail showed up in front of me, I would scream like a little kid.
[181:41.46]I would freak out.
[181:42.08]I would sprint around.
[181:43.52]All the hairs on my body would stand up.
[181:47.83]And I wouldn't be able to come in this room.
[181:49.91]I would have to stay out of this room for a few days.
[181:53.07]I wouldn't be able to go.
[181:54.37]I would not be able to come in here.
[182:01.02]But a huge bug would just be... Okay, that's a big bug.
[182:04.22]Alright, this guy doesn't want to go over here.
[182:06.91]Come on.
[182:13.67]I want to finish this cave.
[182:20.45]Big spider.
[182:21.19]Actually, no, I want this.
[182:23.23]Yeah, let's get this.
[182:23.89]Alright, can I get this without having to deal with this guy?
[182:33.27]I don't think I can.
[182:33.79]I have to kill that thing.
[182:34.47]How am I going to do this?
[182:51.09]Just punch him with Olimar.
[182:55.09]I can try that.
[182:55.55]I don't think I can even get up there.
[183:18.14]I don't have enough damage.
[183:29.84]Wait a minute!
[183:30.56]I've got an idea!
[183:31.14]Ah!
[183:50.68]Am I safe right here?
[183:52.74]I think it's going to hit the wall.
[183:55.12]Yep, I'm safe right here.
[183:55.98]This is perfect.
[184:11.03]Kill!
[184:13.95]Oh, shit.

[184:42.52]We need...
[184:44.95]Okay, we've spread out.
[184:46.87]I wish I could hold C and make them spread out even further.

[185:29.51]Alright.
[185:31.87]What happened?
[185:32.21]I'll take a break after this level.
[185:33.45]Oh.
[185:33.55]And then the rest of you get that crown.
[185:42.07]Oh, you motherfuckers.
[185:43.51]I swear to God, why are you doing that?
[185:47.01]Why are you doing that?
[185:48.55]What, because you walked over here?
[185:52.59]I didn't tell them to do that.
[185:53.77]So why are they doing it?
[185:55.09]I did not tell anybody.
[185:56.50]I did not tell them to do that.
[185:57.96]So why are you doing it?
[186:06.34]Oh, God damn it.
[186:16.86]He's going to kill these guys, isn't he?
[186:18.86]I know he is.
[186:19.46]This is such a pain in the ass.
[186:28.93]You better not attack those guys.
[186:30.21]I will be so... I'll be furious.
[186:31.47]Alright, hurry up.
[186:40.96]Get back to base now.
[186:44.52]The rest of you.
[186:46.00]Get this.
[186:56.59]Let's go.
[186:56.95]Raid song, raid song.
[187:12.80]Oh shit.
[187:13.50]All sham, no wow with a raid.
[187:16.12]Thanks dude.
[187:16.78]Welcome everybody.
[187:18.16]I'll give you a song.
[187:21.16]It just takes some time to realize when you show boat, you show me, you show down, you show me around.
[187:33.92]Thanks for the raid.
[187:34.36]Welcome.
[187:38.64]Am I going to be able to do this in time?
[187:42.77]Nah, hope you had a good stream.
[187:43.75]Thanks.
[187:43.97]Welcome everybody.
[187:45.13]Playing Pikmin 2 for the Nintendo Wii U. The upscaled version from the GameCube to the Wii and then the Wii version ported to the Wii U. I know.
[187:57.18]I know.
[187:57.46]It annoys me too.
[188:05.77]Name one other character from that show.
[188:15.29]Come on, you can get there.
[188:16.47]Please get there.
[188:17.29]Don't make this a waste of time.
[188:18.43]Are they actually not going to get there?
[188:24.47]Name one character from that show that's not Drake and Josh.
[188:29.10]I don't know.
[188:30.64]Didn't they work at a movie theater?
[188:34.66]Josh worked at a movie theater.
[188:38.96]And there was a movie theater employee that he worked with.
[188:41.78]Whoever that was.
[188:46.65]I don't know.
[188:47.29]Alright.
[188:47.51]Well, I have 10 seconds left for them to bring these back.
[188:53.59]Only 120.
[188:53.79]What?
[188:56.17]Unspeakable wonder.
[189:01.67]70% of debt has been recovered.
[189:02.76]10 seconds.
[189:06.70]Shit.
[189:09.22]At least get me one of them in there.
[189:10.40]Come on.
[189:10.78]Come on.
[189:12.58]Come on.
[189:18.12]Hurry.
[189:23.90]Four.
[189:26.35]Three.
[189:26.79]Two.
[189:28.21]They're not going to get it.
[189:32.89]I'm missing somebody.
[189:33.43]Oh, just a few reds.
[189:41.02]Who cares?
[189:51.74]If it was purple, I would be very upset.
[189:53.08]It's just like two reds.
[189:57.84]At least I got the... The crown was a pain in the ass.
[190:17.17]Jerma, sing the Skyrim theme song, but say MonkaS instead.
[190:21.84]I don't... I really don't know what the Skyrim theme song is.
[190:28.90]It's the one that's like... I've never heard it before.
[190:33.86]What is it?
[190:35.16]I don't know.
[190:36.98]Well, the animals that adopted me are actually rather cute once you get used to them.
[190:40.12]Once we get the debt paid off, I might build a refuge for them.
[190:43.64]What do you think?
[190:46.82]This is not a pre-recorded stream.
[190:48.32]Get out of here.
[190:51.02]Hey, as they say in England, fuck off.
[190:54.31]You know what I mean?
[190:54.79]As they say in England, fuck off mate.
[190:59.89]I want to go back in there and go to the cave.
[191:06.02]So I, uh, let's take a break.
[191:08.26]I'm going to go pee.
[191:09.48]I'm going to refill my, uh, well, I have coffee.
[191:11.76]I'm pretending I'm not drinking coffee.
[191:14.15]I'm going to drink some water, get a little bit more coffee.
[191:17.55]And we will continue.
[191:19.04]Be right back.
[191:20.28]Don't go anywhere.
[191:21.00]Unless you have to go somewhere.
[191:23.08]But definitely don't switch to the Super Bowl.
[191:25.46]I'll tell you the score right now.
[191:26.54]It's 0-0.
[191:28.80]Tom Brady has 15 interceptions.
[191:32.54]It's an absolute disaster for him.
[191:38.20]At least that would be like, whatever.
[191:41.33]I'll be back.
[194:32.74]What the hell is that?
[194:34.46]The ultimate gamer chair?
[194:36.41]The saw trap.
[194:38.91]I got a question for you.
[194:39.57]Those of you guys that have or have ever experienced any time with a refrigerator that has an ice maker in it.
[194:47.66]You have your ice.
[194:48.90]Water can come out of there usually.
[194:51.58]And there's always a thing that says crushed ice.
[194:55.02]There's regular ice and you press the button, it's crushed ice.
[194:59.40]Has that ever worked?
[195:01.60]In any fridge you've ever used with a crushed ice, doesn't it just spit out regular ice cubes but make loud fucking noises?
[195:11.17]Why is that even on any fridge?
[195:12.27]I don't get it.
[195:13.61]I've never seen that work.
[195:19.06]It just goes... Ice cubes.
[195:23.22]And some of them are broken.
[195:24.00]I don't even know why they put... Why do they even put that shit on fridges?
[195:27.86]That doesn't make any sense.
[195:30.51]Doesn't do anything.
[195:37.95]We have a bad fridge.
[195:40.45]This has been every fridge I've ever used that's ever had across multiple states and multiple continents that I've never used the crushed ice fridge feature that has ever worked the way it's supposed to be intended.
[196:01.28]I swear to God, this is the last time I'll ever draw a Jerma with a cat feature.
[196:04.22]I swear, I swear, I promise.
[196:05.62]Sub.
[196:11.96]I'm serious.
[196:12.34]I've never seen it work.
[196:14.28]I thought that was supposed to be Shito, and I was like, holy shit.
[196:19.39]That's from Spore.
[196:23.75]Alright, let's keep going.
[196:26.51]I want to go back in that cave.
[196:27.89]I love this game.
[196:29.45]It's very fun.
[196:38.68]let's go alright I want to go back in that cave please read my chat message okay what is it what does it say I've beaten Pikmin 2 and I've been trying to give you tips well I mean this is 10 there's almost 11 000 people here everyone's trying look I'm getting look at the amount of tips that people are screaming at me
[197:10.36]Half of them aren't even real.
[197:13.02]Now, if I pay attention to your tips, what if they're not real?
[197:15.62]What if they're fake?
[197:16.80]If you're trying to get me to throw a Pikmin off the bridge or something.
[197:29.81]Right?
[197:31.25]Ban if not real.
[197:32.31]No.
[197:33.19]I appreciate the tips though.
[197:35.03]I appreciate any tips you could give me.
[197:36.81]Except, I mean... Do I have like a no backseating rule on this channel?
[197:40.94]I really don't.
[197:43.02]No.
[197:43.26]People just write whatever they want.
[197:46.16]Half of it could be fake bullshit.
[197:47.40]Alright.
[197:50.20]I want to go back in that cave.
[197:54.52]But I'll be... Okay.
[197:55.04]I'm going to be totally honest with you.
[197:57.88]Backseating for me...
[198:00.10]Like, I'm not going to listen to you anyways.
[198:02.16]How many times have you guys written something in here that was actually helpful and I just didn't even care?
[198:05.34]I didn't even look at it.
[198:06.02]Like, I'm not going to listen anyways.
[198:07.18]That's happened many times.
[198:10.46]So it's not like I have to have a rule.
[198:13.68]Why do I need a rule if I already don't pay attention?
[198:24.15]Why do I even try?
[198:25.95]No, that's, um, look.
[198:29.99]It's obvious, it's alright.
[198:31.09]I don't, everything's just good.
[198:32.37]I don't need any, I don't need any tips.
[198:33.63]I appreciate the tips, but I don't need them because I'm a professional video game player.
[198:40.83]And, but we went over that on the spore stream.
[198:52.52]Please tell him to go to the secret hole.
[198:56.76]That sounds like a pretty good tip, actually.
[198:58.06]There's a secret hole.
[199:07.84]The secret tunnel?
[199:09.30]Why'd everything respawn?
[199:10.24]Hold on.
[199:10.60]Itchy inside of my ear.
[199:14.80]How did I... I lost somebody?
[199:16.14]99 out of 100.
[199:16.54]Where's the last one?
[199:22.06]I don't know where they are, but it's too late.
[199:26.23]I'm not going to fight anything.
[199:27.07]I'm just going to go.
[199:27.65]I just want to go in the cave.
[199:38.91]I'm not feeding the Pikmin.
[199:40.07]I am.
[199:40.35]I'm giving them the nectar.
[199:50.89]Let's go.
[199:57.16]What's my opinion on roly-polies?
[199:59.48]Uh, the weird bugs that you find under the welcome mat?
[200:02.85]Um, no, they're alright.
[200:11.67]Do I start on- what floor am I on?
[200:13.05]Floor one?
[200:13.49]Shit, this is the first floor, isn't it?
[200:16.29]Damn it, it's the first goddamn floor.
[200:22.38]Wait, technically I could run, right?
[200:24.84]Hold on.
[200:26.52]Technically, I could just run and just go in.
[200:28.56]I don't have to do any of this.
[200:29.72]I could just run.
[200:30.22]Okay, here we go.
[200:32.62]Where's the exit?
[200:40.83]Wait, purple.
[200:46.28]Don't wake that motherfucker up.
[200:47.94]Get out of here.
[201:01.10]Did I just lose a white?
[201:02.23]Oh, man.
[201:04.77]No, I didn't.
[201:05.39]I did.
[201:06.03]Shit.
[201:07.33]Same button.
[201:07.83]Nintendo.
[201:08.19]Why?
[201:08.27]Alright.
[201:18.22]I'm going to back up.
[201:20.66]In fact, I don't trust any of you, so stay here.
[201:23.22]Oh, it's right here.
[201:23.76]Move.
[201:29.29]Move.
[201:34.38]Go invent a console if you keep complaining.
[201:43.49]I'm kidding.
[201:44.95]I don't actually believe any of these things.
[201:47.25]I hope you know that.
[201:49.01]Okay, everyone get out of the way.
[202:03.31]with a big Kappa.
[202:17.70]Kappa.
[202:19.84]What was I?
[202:20.16]I was on level five or six before.
[202:24.39]This guy still believes in Santa.
[202:30.08]What a wild concept that we pretend is real for like five to ten years of people's lives.
[202:35.82]That's sort of bizarre if you think about it.
[202:44.55]We just kind of like pretend that Santa's just a real thing.
[202:48.61]Oh yeah, yeah, Santa's a real guy.
[202:52.01]Run away, run away, run away.
[202:55.19]Where's the exit?
[202:57.88]Wait, little guys.
[203:14.39]There's only one.
[203:18.64]And it is real.
[203:22.00]Where's the exit?
[203:23.78]Thank God he's stuck there.
[203:26.16]Okay.
[203:26.86]Where's the exit though?
[203:28.12]Right there.
[203:28.40]Alright.
[203:45.06]I mean, Santa was a real guy, but like 500 years ago, 800 years ago or something.
[203:51.59]St.
[203:51.81]Nick, right?
[203:52.37]St.
[203:52.55]Nicholas.
[203:59.95]It's like, isn't that based on a real thing?
[204:01.47]He used to put like toys in people's shoes and stuff.
[204:04.25]Like what it's based on something.
[204:06.38]What is it?
[204:06.62]What is it actually based on?
[204:07.42]What is it?
[204:13.89]No, it was a real person.
[204:15.41]It was a real like a tale of a guy that did that.
[204:19.52]Oh, not Krampus.
[204:20.24]Alright, this is the one that I don't want to leave.
[204:23.38]There's a treasure on this one.
[204:25.18]And there's more purples to be had.
[204:26.60]Red.
[204:46.77]Isn't it something in the Bible?
[204:47.83]Yeah, but there was a guy.
[204:49.83]Who was the guy?
[204:53.79]Santa Claus is based on an actual living person.
[205:00.07]What was it?
[205:02.79]Patron saint of... Whatever.
[205:10.57]But fun fact, the actual saint, Nick, punched a guy in the nose.
[205:15.98]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[205:16.80]It's somebody else.
[205:18.00]St.
[205:18.22]Nicholas is the patron saint of sailors, merchants, archers, repentant thieves, prostitutes, children, brewers, pawnbrokers, unmarried people, and students in various cities and countries.
[205:27.82]What?
[205:31.56]Thank you for subscribing to Fun Bug Facts.
[205:33.54]A Vroli Poli Volgaire has also been introduced to many locations in North America where many populations of Zanzibar... Whatever.
[205:41.21]What does that have anything to do with Santa Claus?
[205:44.74]And of course, it's based on St.
[205:45.66]Nick, who was a guy who left gold coins in prostitutes' laundry to let... I don't even know if any of this stuff is... Thank God there's no timer.
[206:13.54]No, I don't want to pick up anybody.
[206:15.93]Jerry, I don't want to pick anybody up.
[206:18.81]I just want the yellow one.
[206:33.65]You know what's really interesting?
[206:36.55]So Seinfeld is a really, really old show.
[206:39.35]It's really, nobody really pays that much attention to it anymore.
[206:43.13]You guys think it's funny.
[206:44.25]You guys think that George is hilarious and shit and Jerry and stuff.
[206:46.92]That's really interesting.
[206:49.50]That's a really timely show then.
[206:53.20]Oh, that's really interesting to think about that.
[206:54.64]Is that a guy electric too?
[207:01.62]It holds up.
[207:02.14]Oh yeah.
[207:02.58]I mean,
[207:10.57]Swarm.
[207:13.07]Swarm him.
[207:18.29]Take the swarm.
[207:21.49]Yeah, the swarm.
[207:22.89]That sounds like a new keyboard.
[207:26.01]The Swarm GX500.
[207:30.71]Loudest mechanical keyboard on the market.
[207:34.97]Let everybody know just how much you're gaming with the Swarm.
[207:48.28]Sounds like a bunch of bees.
[207:49.20]Alright, electricity.
[207:56.93]I have a quiet mechanical keyboard.
[207:58.39]I like soft.
[208:00.35]What do I have?
[208:01.45]Red?
[208:02.31]Cherry red?
[208:04.13]That's the one that's a little softer, right?
[208:06.68]Didn't get anybody.
[208:07.58]Tough luck.
[208:11.87]Terry Red is with the O rings, right?
[208:14.03]I think that's what this is.
[208:15.81]Oh shit, I just completely bad.
[208:17.76]Wow, I just absolutely exposed myself.
[208:21.14]Yeah, no, it's alright.
[208:22.34]I just exposed myself 100%.
[208:24.92]I'm no longer using the Amazon Basics keyboard.
[208:27.32]I told you guys that I was using that.
[208:30.20]I gotta, I gotta do it like a Corsair keyboard or something, I don't know.
[208:38.26]Alright, can we kill this guy please?
[208:43.36]No, give me my friends back.
[208:50.02]Weigh him down.
[208:56.43]Don't let him.
[209:01.47]Don't kill them.
[209:02.33]Weigh him down.
[209:02.93]Oh my God.
[209:05.51]How is this even missing?
[209:06.87]There's rain down on his head.
[209:23.96]Okay.
[209:25.04]I don't know what any of this shit is, but take it.
[209:32.08]What are they saying?
[209:32.94]I can't.
[209:33.18]My voice is too hot low.
[209:51.06]I so badly just want to do the Aya thing.
[209:54.87]I just want to do it right now, and I don't care what the repercussions are.
[210:02.25]Ooh, it's like a Marple.
[210:10.68]There's so many of these enemies here right now.
[210:19.39]You better not.
[210:27.56]Who's going to tell you to stop?
[210:29.26]I'm going to unsub if you do.
[210:30.92]How many people will sub if I do it?
[210:33.38]That's a better question.
[210:34.76]Can we offset the sub that I'm going to lose from that guy?
[210:47.28]I'll sub if you do it.
[210:49.63]How many people will unsubscribe if I do that?
[210:51.41]And how many people will subscribe if I do that?
[210:54.13]This is tricky.
[210:56.14]I will gift a sub.
[210:57.12]Okay.
[210:57.40]This one.
[210:58.24]Two.
[211:09.19]Pole.
[211:09.93]I don't trust a pole with that.
[211:11.33]You guys will just pretend.
[211:24.50]Did I lose somebody?
[211:25.06]Alright.
[211:26.82]Be careful in here.
[211:27.50]Alright.
[211:29.46]Pick him up.
[211:32.99]Let's see.
[211:33.49]I'm curious.
[211:35.51]I'm just going to do it.
[211:36.17]Whatever.
[211:47.11]Do it, do it then.
[211:47.79]I'm just thinking about when I want to do it.
[211:50.76]I'm trying to get a good time.
[211:52.72]Don't, please.
[211:54.68]Somebody said... I think I'm going to get like 100 subs if I do that.
[212:01.22]50 to 60 of you will unsubscribe.
[212:02.44]And like 100 will subscribe.
[212:05.66]So that's a net 40, I guess, gain, right?
[212:14.39]Exactly, huh?
[212:19.11]Alright, so if I say that word, and I get a net 100, a net 40, then if I say shpee immediately afterwards, will you come back?
[212:29.47]All those that are unsubscribed.
[212:38.00]That's going to be really... That's going to fuck with the whole community.
[212:40.40]Okay.
[212:41.88]Because it's one thing that everybody hates and one thing that everybody loves.
[212:44.24]So I'm going to... This is going to pull you guys apart.
[212:46.18]You guys are going to get sucked through like an internet wormhole.
[212:57.03]What happened?
[212:59.05]Everybody alright?
[213:02.91]Is everybody okay?
[213:03.55]I don't know what happened.
[213:05.09]Is everything... Is Goey still here?
[213:14.14]Oh shit, I'm losing subs.
[213:17.52]I'm losing subs, but I'm gaining subs.
[213:22.46]I'm just kidding.
[213:23.58]Maybe I should do it again.
[213:29.10]Alright, watch out for these gliders.
[213:34.91]I'm going to call them gliders.
[213:35.93]Well, thanks for the community subs.
[213:41.70]Get away.
[213:42.54]He took me.
[213:52.29]Get away from me.
[213:54.85]As long as it's not the Bane impression, it's fine.
[213:59.10]How many steps to the Bane impression?
[214:04.84]Oh, my God.
[214:05.54]I just get everybody over here and spam.
[214:12.66]Stop it.
[214:13.62]I hate these things.
[214:28.33]Pick me up every fucking time.
[214:29.95]Just get him.
[214:37.37]Put us down.
[214:38.55]Why is he getting us?
[214:40.31]What the fuck?
[214:40.93]Finally.
[214:41.53]Jeez.
[214:41.69]Kill him.
[214:49.70]I didn't say it.
[214:50.74]That could have been Elmo.
[215:24.73]Just step on his head.
[215:27.46]Okay.
[215:32.42]Apologize.
[215:35.46]It's kind of fun to say, though.
[215:37.34]You know that I say this in my off time?
[215:40.70]It's fun just to go... It's fun to do it.
[215:44.19]I don't know.
[215:44.49]It's nothing about it.
[215:56.46]Why are they not attaching to him?
[216:03.83]Put us down!
[216:09.41]And now we're gonna die.
[216:22.23]Fucking dad ayayaying again.

[217:17.90]Yeah, I think so.
[217:20.97]Oh, you didn't say.
[217:21.49]Oh, I forgot.

[218:14.82]Why is this not giving me health?
[218:17.74]You lied to me.
[218:19.24]What is that guy?

[219:03.86]I'm holding C. Hold C.
[219:12.14]It's not doing anything.
[219:17.71]OK, well, there's like this.

[229:02.64]Oh, he had a fist.
[229:05.32]The Super Bowl doesn't need another 10k viewers.
[229:07.57]No, it doesn't.
[229:15.09]Giant metal hand.
[229:15.91]Perhaps it's an ancient work of art.
[229:24.55]What?
[229:26.44]He's going crazy.
[229:27.78]Emergency.
[229:28.38]Pikmin are suffering.
[229:29.28]If you blow your whistle with B, you may be able to help them.
[229:31.36]What's wrong with him?
[229:33.08]What did he do?
[229:33.74]Did he take too much DMT?
[229:35.10]What are you doing?
[229:46.85]I think we're okay.
[229:50.42]I guess they were suffering somehow.
[230:03.25]Super Bowl watch party with you staring at the TV for six hours.
[230:08.83]And just putting my fist up and going, yeah!
[230:11.53]After every time my team scores points.
[230:23.12]This object seems to replicate a humanoid fist, a glove much like it once lay in my junk hold.
[230:28.76]And here is that very glove I have just found the missing rocket fist in my junk hold.
[230:33.94]Tap A three times to launch it.

[231:46.23]Like right off the bat.
[231:47.33]Oh my god.
[231:47.79]Holy shit, dude.
[231:51.85]What the fuck are you doing to me?
[231:55.59]What?

[232:34.25]Who designed that?
[232:35.19]Terrible design.
[232:36.59]Awful design.
[232:37.45]Worst design I've ever seen in a video game.
[232:39.11]And I've played lots of them.
[232:47.25]That's RNG?
[232:49.15]Oh.
[232:52.53]Oh, nevermind.
[232:57.45]Worst I've ever seen in a video game ever.
[232:59.21]It's just a dice roll.
[233:02.91]What we got in here?
[233:06.71]Fire, water.
[233:07.97]Okay.
[233:22.34]Don't die from this.
[233:23.54]Stay right here.
[233:25.10]OK, keep going.

[234:10.65]This is going to be such a horrible pain in the ass.
[234:12.25]I have to throw them across this.
[234:16.71]Almost all of them.
[234:56.57]It's a purple in here.

[236:44.21]Shit, I can't get that.
[236:48.68]I can't get any of these things.
[236:49.64]I don't have enough loot.
[236:52.00]Come on, really?
[236:52.62]What about the bulbman?
[236:58.68]The bulbman.

[238:35.14]I had more blues at the start of this level.
[238:36.96]I don't think I did.
[238:38.00]Did I?
[238:38.33]Did they die?
[238:40.03]I had 11 at subspace six.
[238:45.67]I did.
[238:45.97]I did.
[238:49.04]Oh, right.

[239:18.37]What does that even mean?
[239:27.40]Oh, wait.
[239:27.80]I have to turn it back on.
[239:28.76]It went into sleep mode.
[239:43.61]I love his face.

[241:06.46]Alright, let's come on back.
[241:13.23]Nintendo.
[241:19.45]Nintendo.
[241:21.96]Just love playing the Nintendo.
[241:30.47]I just love the Nintendo.
[241:31.81]Okay.
[241:39.53]Let's see if I get absolutely destroyed this time.
[241:45.11]Two dumb spawns right next to me that just start shooting rocks everywhere.
[241:51.74]What do we got?
[241:54.53]Wow, that's a way better room.
[241:58.40]This room doesn't suck ass.
[241:59.78]Okay.
[242:00.10]Let's take the purples.
[242:18.67]I don't know why I want to do Sir Finley Murgleton so bad right now.
[242:21.67]It's just grabbing a hold of me.
[242:22.87]I don't know why.
[242:23.68]I need fire to get rid of that.
[242:44.09]Punch them.
[242:47.67]I could try the punch.
[242:48.85]Yeah, I'm not bringing anybody over there.
[242:50.19]I'm going to punch.
[242:57.07]Oh, my God.
[242:59.27]Hit him.
[243:00.53]That would have been horrible.
[243:01.79]Alright, everybody stay back.
[243:03.71]I'm going for the punch.
[243:04.61]I just got stun locked.
[243:18.27]Olimar is a clown.
[243:19.44]Olimar is a fucking clown.
[243:26.08]What happened?
[243:29.28]Wait, what happens?
[243:29.98]Oh.
[243:42.95]Just take rid of this so I can get over here.
[243:48.09]I didn't even know why these guys are even spawning here.
[243:50.97]It's like, where are you supposed to even go with this?
[243:54.66]My teeth.
[243:55.64]I'm just talking through my teeth.

[244:58.31]Make them shoot each other.
[244:59.77]Yeah, and then one of them is going to fire one.
[245:05.20]That was the dumbest thing I've ever seen in my life.
[245:06.96]I don't even know what happened.
[245:07.74]How did it even happen?
[245:08.46]That was stupid.
[245:09.16]That was the dumbest fucking thing I've ever seen.
[245:25.93]Ooh, look.
[245:26.75]It's a bulbous.
[245:46.15]Alright, I gotta evolve this.
[246:00.36]Can I do this with Louie?
[246:08.64]Okay, do we have enough blue to do this?
[246:11.24]Okay, thank God.
[246:16.77]Let's go.
[246:18.35]I need red as well to get rid of the fire and the Bulbuses.
[246:58.61]OK.
[247:01.55]Here we go.
[247:07.69]Well, I had to do that because they have to.
[247:08.81]They have to pull the they gotta walk through that.
[247:14.19]OK, there's one more of these assholes over here.
[247:17.12]Oh perfect.
[247:21.21]Good RNG.
[247:22.03]Good RNG.
[247:32.65]Don't get on that with them.
[247:35.95]You're just going to die if you do that.
[247:42.50]That's pretty good RNG.
[247:43.86]Nice.
[247:44.10]Alright.
[247:45.06]Now we just gotta wait for them to be done.
[247:47.84]In the meantime, what can I do?
[247:49.28]Oh, shit.
[247:49.56]Hold on.
[247:53.13]In the meantime, I'm going to make this guy shoot himself.
[247:57.05]The chest piece.
[247:57.73]Nice.
[247:58.85]Pog.
[248:07.18]Okay.
[248:08.18]Now get shot.
[248:15.74]How much is that worth?
[248:17.51]80.
[248:17.63]Pretty good.
[248:18.83]Pretty cool.
[248:31.14]You can do it.
[248:31.56]Yeah.
[248:44.25]Uh, okay.
[248:49.49]I just keep hearing this in my brain.
[248:51.01]Alright.
[248:58.67]Blues, get back.
[249:01.28]I said blue.
[249:01.90]I don't want any white there.
[249:03.02]Blue.
[249:09.40]Alright, we should have enough to get the last piece.
[249:16.36]It's 10.
[249:18.02]Alright, is there anything else in here?
[249:21.90]What about up here?
[249:24.83]No.
[249:26.15]That is all that remains.
[249:30.84]You alright?
[249:31.16]Alright, you're good.
[249:41.00]Don't go in there with them.
[249:44.30]You guys just really like to put yourselves into danger, don't you?
[249:50.33]And then I'll be able to take everybody up.
[249:53.19]So again, please confirm with me again.
[249:54.75]If I go into here just as Louie, everybody comes with me.
[249:58.05]Doesn't matter if they're part of the crew or not, right?
[250:06.52]Correct.
[250:06.76]Okay.
[250:07.56]Fantastic.
[250:20.63]Old men are immune to everything.
[250:21.61]That's good.
[250:22.67]Because I'll be sending them wherever they want to go next.
[250:28.43]Okay.
[250:29.57]We're good.
[250:30.97]Hold C. It's not healing.
[250:37.36]Treasure's gone.
[250:37.94]Let's go.
[250:45.98]But lies deeper.
[250:47.04]Is this level seven or eight?
[250:58.87]Olimar is dead.
[250:59.84]He is.
[251:06.87]What do we got?
[251:08.11]What's over here?
[251:10.97]Nothing.
[251:12.93]Explore it.
[251:13.44]There's the way down.
[251:20.14]Okay.
[251:22.24]It doesn't look too bad so far.
[251:24.70]Unless there's something in the ground.
[251:33.10]And there's something wrong there.
[251:36.54]Something fell from the ceiling.
[251:49.08]Come with me.
[251:57.58]Watch out.
[251:58.50]Watch out.
[251:58.94]I'm very cautious about this.
[252:03.95]Okay, yeah.
[252:04.65]It says stuff, shit drops from the ceiling.
[252:06.03]Good to know.
[252:10.38]Oh boy.
[252:10.78]Okay.
[252:16.00]What do we got over here?
[252:20.86]That's the way down.
[252:23.45]Watch it.
[252:26.85]Where's this treasure?
[252:32.77]Down here?
[252:42.46]Where is this damn thing?
[252:46.24]Oh, man.
[252:47.38]Oh, there's a white thing.
[252:50.62]Okay, I need to... Who should I throw in here?
[252:55.71]Yellow?
[252:57.45]Probably yellow.
[253:03.69]Okay.
[253:09.43]Do not drop a meteor on me right here, please.
[253:12.16]Don't drop a meteor here.
[253:16.86]Thank God.
[253:17.42]Okay, a lot of big guys.
[253:23.44]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[253:44.59]Run, run, run, run, run.
[253:55.45]Oh!
[254:26.81]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[254:30.01]Come back.
[254:32.39]Oh, my God.
[254:32.83]He runs really fast.
[254:34.71]He's really fast.
[254:38.86]Go back to sleep.
[254:46.66]Come on back here.
[254:47.98]Run away.
[255:08.09]Good.
[255:08.63]Okay, now I'm ready.
[255:10.77]Let's get our... There's something to dig up there.
[255:13.43]But I don't want to get killed by any explosions.
[255:19.08]I swear to God, a meteor is going to kill everybody, aren't they?
[255:26.32]I'm so afraid of a meteor just dropping right now.
[255:28.28]Please don't.
[255:35.49]What do you think Pikmin tastes like, Jerma?
[255:38.82]Probably acidic.
[255:40.44]Acid.
[255:48.36]Acid.
[255:51.45]They probably taste very acidic.
[255:55.71]Sour.
[255:57.27]You know what a Sour Patch Kid tastes like?
[256:00.54]Okay.
[256:00.80]Now do you know what, you know, okay.
[256:02.12]You know, when lightning strikes and you get that smell outside, it kind of smells like ozone.
[256:07.72]I feel like it's like a mix of Sour Patch Kids and ozone.
[256:10.22]Okay.
[256:24.97]It's really funny when people say that, what are you talking about smelling ozone?
[256:29.50]That's what you smell.
[256:31.36]When a thunderstorm is happening and there's lightning and that electricity kind of smell, that rain, lightning kind of smell, that's ozone.
[256:37.91]Ozone and bacteria and stuff.
[256:40.49]That's correct.
[256:41.61]I thought I was the stupid one.
[256:43.13]What are you talking about?
[256:47.69]Look it up right now.
[256:48.57]Go look it up right now.
[256:56.31]You're a bozone.
[256:59.73]A yo-yo.
[257:00.37]Nice.
[257:02.59]He's right.
[257:03.07]Yeah, I know.
[257:03.75]You're spelling ozone.
[257:10.90]See all those question marks that were spammed when I first said that?
[257:13.84]And now all of them have been educated.
[257:23.58]It smells like ozone in here.
[257:25.10]Um, I would not... That's not good for you.
[257:28.74]You don't want to be breathing in ozone that much.
[257:30.94]That's not good.
[257:31.56]Alright, where's the, uh... How do I go deeper?
[257:39.21]Yeah, you really... Actually, like, ozone's not good for you.
[257:50.71]Like, just breathe in.
[257:52.91]You shouldn't be.
[257:53.53]Alright, level eight.
[257:58.84]I'm still hearing that god awful noise.
[258:01.02]Level eight.
[258:22.80]Final floor.
[258:23.34]Okay, so there's going to be a boss down here.
[258:24.74]Oh, okay.
[258:30.70]Take it slow.
[258:46.43]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[258:48.03]Who's eating?
[258:48.67]Who's eating?
[258:49.13]What was that?
[258:53.51]Oh my god, they have fucking muppet frogs!
[258:59.03]What happened?
[258:59.49]No?
[259:08.82]I don't even know what I'm aiming at!
[259:29.44]Everybody eating?
[259:38.58]Oh my god, turn the camera to the wrong- Oh shit!
[259:42.22]Oh shit!
[259:43.10]Oh god, they're coming!
[259:46.11]Oh my god, they're coming!
[259:50.43]Oh my god, they're-
[260:04.73]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[260:12.08]What the fuck?
[260:15.16]Where are they coming from?
[260:20.54]What the fuck?
[260:25.93]I hear evil guy music.
[260:30.41]This way, this way, this way.
[260:31.51]Where are they?
[260:34.66]Where are the other ones?
[260:35.24]Where are the other ones?
[260:39.08]Stop fucking eating my friends.
[260:51.83]Oh, shit.
[260:52.57]Okay, hold on.
[261:02.85]What the fuck?
[261:05.25]Come with me.
[261:05.73]Alright, get him.
[261:07.19]Go on his butt.
[261:08.59]Whoa, he's got a face.
[261:10.78]He's gonna roll, isn't he?
[261:11.60]He's gonna roll.
[261:12.04]He's gonna roll.
[261:12.50]He's gonna roll.
[261:13.08]This guy rolls.
[261:14.70]This motherfucker rolls.
[261:15.48]Back up.
[261:23.47]Back up, back up, back up.
[261:24.29]Everyone run.
[261:24.93]Run, run, run.
[261:25.49]He rolls.
[261:26.07]I knew it.
[261:29.93]Kill these.
[261:41.51]Alright, let him, let him.
[261:42.23]E, E, E, E, E, E. Fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[261:43.89]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[261:45.67]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[261:47.42]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[261:48.56]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[261:49.66]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[261:50.68]Here it comes.
[261:54.72]Run, run, run, run, run, run.
[262:04.10]Out of the way.
[262:07.10]Ooh, they're not going to make it.
[262:08.18]They're not going to make it.
[262:13.12]Oh shit.
[262:13.70]Okay.
[262:13.92]I'm good.
[262:20.08]Alright.
[262:22.14]Pull it back.
[262:22.58]Pull it back.
[262:23.02]Pull it back.
[262:23.62]Don't go that way.
[262:24.62]Oh shit.
[262:25.00]Thank God.
[262:25.24]Alright.
[262:25.91]I got this in the bag.
[262:26.61]This is good.
[262:30.61]It's alright.
[262:30.93]We had a lot of, there were a lot of casualties.
[262:32.65]That's right.
[262:37.87]He's dead right here again.
[262:43.92]Goodbye.
[262:44.64]Dead.
[262:48.22]I got a little shoe.
[262:49.06]That was terrifying with the little frog people.
[262:57.09]Outer stink limits.
[263:01.16]Stench must be emanating from that object.
[263:12.80]Don't.
[263:13.50]Why are you still here?
[263:14.12]Did you actually eat one?
[263:20.10]You fucker.
[263:20.78]Are there still any alive?
[263:23.24]I'm so scared that they're going to keep eating.
[263:27.81]I got to follow these guys back because this is going to be bad.
[263:31.93]There's definitely a couple that I didn't kill.
[263:33.35]Maybe not.
[263:40.77]Alright, I think we're good.
[263:43.59]Hurry up.
[263:51.14]Well, that could have gone way worse.
[263:56.32]I think that's a success.
[263:57.18]That's a successful cave completion. 100.
[264:12.64]This object has pockets of air under its surface.
[264:14.56]It is perfect for the boots I am making.
[264:17.78]More run speed.
[264:20.58]Rush boots.
[264:23.46]These nullify wind resistance by circulating air beneath the soles.
[264:26.16]Okay.
[264:27.94]You'll move faster and you'll no longer be blown away by puffy blow hogs.
[264:32.02]Oh, cool.
[264:38.66]There's still treasure here.
[264:39.46]No, there's not.
[264:41.06]Damn it.
[264:46.75]Very cool.
[264:48.53]That is it.
[264:49.81]Let's get out of here.
[264:56.52]Everyone's eating, right?
[264:58.08]It's free food.
[265:02.44]Do the cave at the far side of the perplexing pool.
[265:04.56]It's a fan favorite.
[265:07.14]Cave at the far side of the perplexing pool.
[265:11.36]Well, we'll see.
[265:14.16]Nothing else here.
[265:15.60]Let's go.
[265:21.50]Is the cave that's... Yeah, that's the cave I want to do.
[265:31.77]Oh no!
[265:32.33]My little bulb friends.
[265:33.42]That's unfortunate.
[265:34.14]8,000.
[265:37.88]They should be able to come with me.
[265:43.55]That's not fair.
[265:55.61]How much time do I have left in the day?
[265:56.69]Oh, Olimar's back.
[266:12.26]Oh, no, he's not.
[266:12.84]He's not doing that well.
[266:14.20]Okay.
[266:16.38]I still have almost a whole day.
[266:18.70]What do I want to do?
[266:21.01]I need more blue.
[266:21.99]Bad.
[266:22.73]Bad.
[266:28.24]I guess we'll get some red.
[266:37.74]And finish it up with yellow.
[266:42.33]We don't need 100.
[266:43.73]It's fine.
[266:48.61]We already went that way.
[266:49.47]This way... There was another cave over here, wasn't there?
[266:55.43]I swear to God, there's another cave over here.
[267:00.55]I did the one that was further away.
[267:02.23]You need to bury Olimar.
[267:08.56]We're not getting stuck, right?
[267:10.30]Okay.
[267:12.70]Have a burial for Olimar.
[267:16.12]Come on, you can do it.
[267:17.57]Guys, come on.
[267:21.09]Get over here.
[267:25.91]You're so slow.
[267:33.96]Treasure.
[267:36.98]Wait, wait.
[267:37.94]Treasure somewhere up here.
[267:41.00]Hold on.
[267:44.34]Hold on.
[267:46.64]Oh boy.
[267:47.24]How many people do I have?
[268:07.68]Anything dangerous in the way?
[268:08.88]Or can they bring it back?
[268:16.48]What is it?
[268:21.04]Pineapple?
[268:23.32]Artichoke?
[268:25.76]Alright, bring the artichoke back.
[268:35.38]Alright, there was... I've got to be careful here.
[268:40.14]I have so many slow Pikmin.
[268:44.08]There's a cave up this way.
[268:45.86]Have I gone... Hold on.
[268:46.80]Oh, I completed that one?
[268:50.34]I completed that one too.
[268:53.08]Oh, shit.
[268:53.38]I think I did everything here.
[268:54.17]Did I complete the first actual level?
[268:57.03]I think it's done.
[269:02.88]Wait, what about... Did I go in this one?
[269:05.06]No, I didn't do this one.
[269:17.09]I wonder if I should just go in here.
[269:19.46]No, no, no.
[269:20.42]I don't have Olimar.
[269:21.06]I think I'm just going to end the day.
[269:35.53]I might be a coward, but... Does that make me a coward?
[269:46.36]Arm for some Pikmin.
[269:47.66]Yeah, that's true.
[269:49.22]Alright, we're going to kill.
[269:50.46]We're going to kill everything over here.
[270:04.25]And then we're going to have blue take everything back.
[270:07.51]Ooh, look at that.
[270:08.15]Need purple.
[270:24.37]Come back, come back, come back.
[270:25.69]No, you could have had it.
[270:26.33]You could have killed it.
[270:26.85]Just kill it.
[270:27.23]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[270:28.21]You had it.
[270:28.49]Okay, blue.
[270:33.54]Bring that back to blue.
[270:34.69]Watch out for this guy.
[270:36.53]This guy, he's gonna shoot you.
[270:42.45]It's homing missile.
[270:43.11]Fuck.
[270:43.59]Okay, just... Why are they not... Oh my god, don't ruin this.
[270:57.58]Hurry, run!
[270:59.44]Hit him!
[271:00.62]Yes!
[271:01.04]Okay, we're good.
[271:03.06]Look at that.
[271:03.48]Double.
[271:05.12]That was completely intentional.
[271:06.16]I did that on purpose.
[271:08.42]Don't.
[271:14.53]Okay.
[271:15.09]Can we please not have the red idiots pick it up?
[271:19.25]Purple.
[271:20.96]Pick that up.
[271:21.36]Bring it back to blue.
[271:24.37]No.
[271:25.57]I fucking hate the red Pikmin.
[271:27.39]They're the worst.
[271:28.32]It's always them.
[271:29.52]They're always the ones that start picking shit up.
[271:31.30]It's always them.
[271:32.16]They're always the ones that do it.
[271:41.20]Get off!
[271:43.50]Get... I'm about to throw these guys in the ocean.
[271:45.83]I'm serious.
[271:46.91]Why do they keep doing that?
[271:54.07]Alright, everybody fuck off.
[271:55.07]That's so mean.
[272:06.16]No, it's not mean.
[272:07.18]It's called get out of here.
[272:08.60]We're trying to get blue Pikmin, not red Pikmin.
[272:11.42]Why is this red?
[272:15.53]I'm very upset with the red Pikmin right now.
[272:17.53]They're messing this whole thing up.
[272:42.97]Nobody touch that fucking thing.
[272:48.03]How many do I need?
[272:57.43]Two over there.
[272:58.91]Over there.
[273:00.95]OK, purple.
[273:09.15]Help, help.
[273:12.22]Wait, I need a blue.
[273:21.86]And then I need a blue over there.
[273:26.30]OK, blue and then I need another blue from here.
[273:29.28]That's OK, that doesn't matter.
[273:33.92]You can take yellow from that.
[273:34.80]I don't care.
[273:47.25]It's alright, I'm going to when I get back, I'll make sure I change this blue, don't worry.
[273:56.16]Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey. Hey.
[274:10.85]What was that all about?
[274:29.55]There's too many people.
[274:30.65]Get the fuck out of my way.
[274:32.37]There's too many people.
[274:43.28]You motherfuckers.
[274:48.40]I can't.
[274:48.94]I hate it.
[274:49.66]Just get out of the way.
[274:53.62]Please.
[274:54.36]Don't go this way.
[274:55.70]Why are you going over here?
[275:03.10]What happened to the other guys with the coins?
[275:15.26]Is everybody good?
[275:19.31]They went the long way?
[275:20.15]Did they really?
[275:20.67]Of course they did.
[275:24.59]I'm surprised they didn't get eaten.
[275:29.87]Get back here.
[275:35.58]Why did they go this way?
[275:36.82]And you're going to run right into a bunch of red Pikmin.
[275:40.91]And it's going to fuck everything up.
[275:43.01]Just everybody stay back here.
[275:44.21]Stay here.
[275:44.71]Why are they putting...
[276:05.62]Go crush his head.
[276:09.30]Oh, no.
[276:13.76]Just get it.
[276:16.92]Oh, my God.
[276:17.36]He blew up.
[276:33.21]Don't touch that.
[276:37.27]I don't care who gets them.
[276:38.07]Just bring them in.
[276:44.34]What about Olimar?
[276:47.16]Wait.
[276:47.56]What about Olimar?
[276:50.58]I love how they go.
[276:51.48]Look at how long.
[276:52.12]That's such a long way.
[276:53.44]Why'd they go that way?
[276:56.70]You have to leave them.
[276:57.40]98, 99.
[276:57.44]98, 99.
[276:59.99]100.
[277:00.01]You're dead.
[277:25.70]Ah, okay, that was close.
[277:54.04]This is a fun game.
[278:00.67]I'm going to pee one more time.
[278:05.95]And we will continue.
[278:06.77]I'll be right back.
[279:41.60]Okay.
[279:43.16]So we're probably going to call it here in the next 30 minutes or so.
[279:48.12]30, 40 minutes, maybe something like that.
[279:52.76]Probably enough to do another day.
[279:54.64]I like this game, though.
[279:55.94]I'm going to beat this game.
[279:58.77]I think I'm pretty positive about that one.
[280:01.59]Or at least, I'll stream this at least one more time.
[280:05.29]I really like it.
[280:11.82]They were left to starve.
[280:18.77]Did all your fan art trends in one image minus that weird Jerma dude.
[280:25.39]You're close.
[280:30.25]I thought when I get to the end of the debt, that was like just not even like 60% of the way through the game.
[280:45.75]Alright, let's go.
[280:50.79]When you're down, and I think by, whatever.
[280:57.61]At 8,000, everything has been done here besides there's a cave there.
[281:04.88]Where have I, what have I not done?
[281:06.16]There's two things I haven't, perplexing pool.
[281:08.72]Yeah, let's go here.
[281:13.94]There's a lot more game after the death.
[281:22.74]Well, maybe I'll just play it one more time.
[281:25.36]If I don't beat it tonight, then we'll just do it again.
[281:27.14]Alright, what do I want?
[281:29.98]I want... Yes, there we go.
[281:33.31]Now I got lots of blue.

[281:46.22]20 fire and then purple and white to fill up the rest of the party.
[282:04.39]Okay, here we go.
[282:06.78]Now, where do I want to go?
[282:08.42]It's pretty open right now.
[282:13.16]Did I do this cave?
[282:15.44]I didn't do this cave.
[282:19.60]What is this cave?
[282:23.09]Citadel of spiders.
[282:24.11]Zero treasures in this shit.

[283:50.72]Okay, I see.
[283:51.38]I want the tomato.
[284:04.32]A tomato's going to be worth at least 100 bucks.
[284:05.88]Guaranteed.
[284:06.40]These guys are annoying.
[284:15.67]Did you free up the space now?

[286:39.99]Oh.
[286:41.85]Habangui.
[286:46.65]Come on, Gwen.

[287:42.18]RC Cola.
[287:44.12]That's a good one.
[287:51.21]I think I can... This little guy, can I... Is that a guy?
[287:53.85]Can I kill that thing?
[288:02.05]RC Cola is nasty.
[288:03.17]I mean, it's just... It's Cola.
[288:06.15]Is that an enemy or is that a treasure?
[288:07.27]Okay, that's a treasure.
[288:17.65]Oh, is it red?
[288:18.18]Oh, what's that?
[288:19.90]Like a little duck?
[288:21.78]Look at the little rubber ducky.

[289:15.45]Okay.
[289:15.69]We're good.
[289:18.83]That's it.
[289:19.13]There's nothing else here.
[289:20.39]I can just leave.
[289:20.85]I don't need to kill everything.
[289:23.37]Why would I need to kill everything?
[289:24.19]Let's go.
[289:36.28]Nya hun, nya hun, nya hun, nya hun, nya hun, nya hun, nya hun.
[289:40.14]Nya hun, nya hun, nya hun.

[290:01.39]Practicing Catboy.
[290:02.39]That's supposed to be a Pikmin.
[290:07.70]That's a bad place to start.
[290:10.44]Uh... I need, uh... That's electric, right?
[290:14.47]Well, didn't do a very good job separating.

[291:08.92]He's got to go first.
[291:24.19]Kill them all.
[291:24.75]Yep.
[291:25.49]That's the plan.

[292:08.07]Why is it doing that?
[292:15.79]never played Pikmin I don't really understand what's going on can you explain it sure um so I am a guy that landed on a planet and there's these little creatures little alien bug things called Pikmin they're different colors and the different colors are different things so yellow is electric red is fire blue is water white is gas purple is super strength and um that's it and you have to pick them you have to take them and have them do various tasks
[292:46.10]they have to pick up stuff you have to get treasure you have to go deep into caves and find stuff it's pretty cool now hopefully they don't okay this is bad and then at it's timed at the end of every day uh you have to run away
[293:13.53]Because the monsters will come and eat you.
[293:18.51]And it's fun to collect stuff.
[293:26.01]You run around, you just collect things.
[293:35.28]Uh, what am I doing that for?
[293:36.28]Oh, there's an egg in there.
[293:36.88]Okay, yeah.
[293:46.80]Alright, everybody get that.
[293:48.04]Bring it back to the base.
[293:55.23]And then crack that.
[293:56.05]Wait, I gotta kill everything in here first.
[293:57.29]There's a lot of treasure in this one.
[293:59.29]There's like five, six hundred bucks worth of stuff in here.
[294:12.42]Don't let him slam.
[294:13.06]Good.
[294:18.76]And what's that worth?
[294:23.34]100.
[294:23.38]Yes.

[294:38.73]We got the whole world watching now.
[294:41.02]Welcome to the space jam.
[294:43.58]We're thinking of making another one.
[294:53.82]They are?
[294:54.22]I feel like they've been talking about that for the last five plus years.
[294:56.34]Are they actually going to make it?
[295:03.30]Why is that movie vaporware?
[295:04.52]I feel like Space Jam 2 coming out in like 2013.

[295:36.20]I don't care.
[295:45.69]I do care, but just not enough.
[295:52.57]Everybody stomp him.

[296:18.03]I mean, I guess people could... You guys could just get these.
[296:20.93]Just get them while we have a minute.
[296:24.25]It's free money.
[296:30.11]That's it, right?
[296:35.06]And I can break that egg.
[296:42.18]Nice.
[296:44.90]Water chestnuts.
[296:47.19]Something really funny about water chestnuts.
[296:48.65]I was going to make a tweet two days ago talking about how much I loved water chestnuts.
[296:55.15]And I only eat them like once a year.
[297:00.36]I was going to tweet about my absolute love for water chestnuts.
[297:03.02]How come they're not in more stuff?
[297:09.46]I love the texture.
[297:10.20]I love the way they feel.
[297:11.66]I love the sound they make too.
[297:13.62]When you bite into a water chestnut, it makes this incredible noise.
[297:17.12]It's this like... It's amazing.
[297:27.01]Water chestnuts are gross.
[297:31.37]They are not.
[297:32.25]I'm sorry.
[297:33.03]You've lost your mind.
[297:39.07]They're wonderful.
[297:42.52]They have that amazing texture to them.
[297:47.12]I can feel it right now.
[297:48.02]That's it.
[297:50.60]Let's go.
[297:50.92]Luigi's Mansion.
[298:02.66]They don't have any taste?
[298:13.39]Will they soak up whatever the sauce you have is?
[298:16.01]Alright, this is still not the last floor.
[298:26.23]Cool.
[298:30.47]That like... Is my phone on vibrate?
[298:40.50]What the fuck are you walking into that?
[298:43.44]What are you doing?
[298:45.49]What are you doing?
[298:52.33]Get it.
[298:52.79]Alright, crack that egg.
[298:54.33]We need some more food.
[298:55.01]Let there not be spiders in here.
[299:03.45]Mmm delish.
[299:09.37]Break this down.
[299:10.33]This is free treats man.
[299:11.57]This is awesome.
[299:13.45]I've made like almost $1000 in here and this is not a hard dungeon.
[299:20.16]Oh never mind.
[299:22.86]What do I need to replace?
[299:29.88]Blue.
[299:38.07]I think I'm running out of reds.
[299:42.61]Alright, let's do fire again.
[299:54.27]Wait, break this stone.
[300:02.50]Another egg.
[300:04.12]Cool.
[300:05.99]There's so many reds in the ship.
[300:08.61]Yeah.
[300:10.11]Yeah, that's true.
[300:14.38]OK, now fire.
[300:32.06]Good kill.

[307:27.40]And he dropped a key.
[307:30.44]A key to what door?
[307:42.65]Sweet victory.
[307:43.61]That giant insect's body has crumbled to dust.
[307:46.81]I'm quite relieved to know I won't have to store such an enormous bug.
[307:52.05]Analyzing soil samples.
[307:53.19]Anomaly detected.
[307:53.97]What's that glittering widget?

[311:16.11]Submerged castle.
[311:20.05]This way?
[311:28.14]I'm going to take blue.
[311:32.58]Everybody hang out here.
[311:37.44]Well, you know, just kill these guys first.

[311:56.28]Any treasures?
[311:59.08]Electricity.
[312:01.60]How do I get over that?
[312:02.20]Do I have to throw them from here?
[312:03.46]How would I do that?
[312:11.47]Stop doing that.
[312:15.50]How do I get electric?
[312:16.14]Do I have to drain this?
[312:21.18]Oh, what is that?
[312:21.92]Is that a treasure?
[312:27.44]What is that?
[312:27.72]A stingray or a treasure?

[320:27.73]I thought that was a cave.

[324:08.76]Okay, I don't care.
[324:09.36]100.
[324:09.38]Don't move.
[324:15.52]One of the blue ones just couldn't figure out how to walk up the goddamn stairs.
[324:18.18]That doesn't matter.
[324:19.78]Whatever.
[324:19.96]We're good.
[324:36.42]I tried.
[324:36.76]I went back twice.
[324:37.59]And he just was like, I'm walking to a wall?
[324:39.37]I don't know.
[324:41.23]It's not my fault.
[324:42.05]I went back for him.
[324:42.63]Alright, I'm going to call it for tonight.
[324:51.70]I will be back on Thursday.
[324:54.06]Probably have some more updates for you guys.
[324:57.78]Thursday's plan is we're going to beat Pikmin.
[325:02.70]And then, depending, that probably is only going to take like another hour or two.
[325:06.27]Maybe.
[325:08.37]We'll move on to something else after Pikmin.
[325:13.77]That's the plan.
[325:18.18]I have to assume that to get to 10,000 and to do some of the late game stuff, probably another couple hours, two or three hours.
[325:25.85]And who knows, maybe it just, we finish Pikmin and do a whole stream on it.
[325:29.28]We'll see.
[325:29.52]It was really fun.
[325:36.76]I'm really into it.
[325:38.64]All the while, you'll soon be promoted to manager.
[325:40.38]Only a small bit of debt remains.
[325:41.59]You've done great.
[325:47.05]So we'll see you on Thursday.
[325:49.49]Thursday around two o'clock Pacific.
[325:54.88]2 p.m.
[325:55.34]Pacific time.
[325:56.07]We'll see you then.
[326:02.23]Thanks for joining me as always.
[326:04.21]See you soon.
[326:05.51]I love Pikmin.
[326:06.57]Big fan.
[326:07.93]Really big fan.
[326:08.55]Thanks to the subs, everybody.
[326:09.25]There were a lot of community subs for a joke.
[326:11.70]But even still, that's a lot.
[326:14.44]Thank you, guys.
[326:18.78]Hope you had fun.
[326:22.70]Oh, yeah.
[326:22.90]I said ayaya.
[326:23.93]That's right.
[326:26.30]I did a few times, more than once.
[326:28.30]Yeah, it was at least a few times.
[326:39.46]He was so drunk.
[326:48.86]Nah, we'll see you on Wednesday.
[326:50.20]I mean, no, don't say that on Thursday.
[326:51.59]Don't get it wrong.
[327:02.34]No, Thursday.
[327:02.92]Not Wednesday.
[327:03.34]We're streaming on Thursday at 2 p.m.
[327:04.48]Pacific.
[327:06.62]I'm going to dump you guys on Etalyx today.
[327:10.24]Say hello to Etalyx.
[327:11.19]What is he doing?
[327:13.13]Valheim?
[327:13.91]What is Valheim?
[327:17.63]It's a survival game.
[327:21.09]Okay, well.
[327:26.15]Etalyx hates us.
[327:28.39]Well, I don't know.
[327:28.99]Maybe it's like bullying people into singing.
[327:32.42]Hey, we gotta get a better reputation for you guys.
[327:41.83]One of these days, somebody's gonna shut you guys down and be like, I ain't singing.
[327:45.51]Like, fuck off.
[327:47.19]And then you're all gonna feel real bad.
[327:48.67]You're gonna be like, oh shit, he was pissed.
[327:51.29]I'll see you guys on Thursday.
[327:58.05]Good night.
[327:58.83]Take care of yourselves.
[328:02.46]It's already happened?
[328:03.52]Probably.
[328:03.94]I don't know.
[328:04.86]If I was a streamer, I'd be like, I'm not singing for this random dude.
[328:09.57]Good night, guys.
[328:09.97]Take care of yourselves.
[328:11.91]Go say hello to Etalyx.
[328:57.42]Thank you.
