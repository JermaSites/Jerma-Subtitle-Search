[00:17.06]Too many of you guys bet on the sure thing.
[00:22.53]And it works until it doesn't.
[00:25.47]There were millions of channel points that said I would not be live in the next 15 minutes.
[00:31.33]That was about seven minutes ago.
[00:36.97]I know that 98% of the time that's accurate.
[00:39.65]But not this time.
[00:46.22]Trying to pay it out.
[00:48.36]Big payday.
[00:56.30]6.1 million goes to Meowmix and 341 other people.
[01:03.47]Nice job.
[01:06.83]Make sure I tweet this out.

[02:08.72]EA?
[02:09.08]This is not an EA game.
[02:09.93]What are you talking about?

[02:19.37]Passapout?
[02:20.63]The artist game?
[02:22.19]This one's different.
[02:24.11]I think this one's a little more involved than that one is.
[02:29.37]What was it called?
[02:29.86]Passpartout?
[02:31.24]Passapout?
[02:35.54]No, not Patavon.

[02:49.98]I don't know what happened three nights ago, man.
[02:52.22]I have no idea.
[02:54.32]I walked in a circle in the third Hitman level for like 25 straight minutes and just was yelling at myself.
[03:03.11]Didn't I talk shit about parking garages?
[03:04.73]I don't know what happened.
[03:07.81]Everything was going so well.
[03:08.77]And then I just started talking shit about parking garages and I walked in a circle for 20 minutes and I turned the stream on.
[03:16.00]What the fuck happened?
[03:21.70]He fucking hates concrete.
[03:23.24]Yeah, I was talking about how concrete sucks and stuff.
[03:25.94]I don't know.
[03:33.34]Well, we'll just pretend that last 20 minutes of the last stream didn't happen.

[05:44.01]Jack Cheese.
[05:44.67]Havarti is not a cheese.
[05:45.77]What the hell is it then?
[05:48.43]What is Havarti?
[05:55.34]I love Havarti.
[05:56.68]Havarti is awesome.
[05:59.44]Havarti is kind of like... It's a cheese that just sort of sits there and...
[06:05.41]The flavor of Havarti is sort of just like, it doesn't even really taste like much, but you know it's cheese, so you just put it on your sandwich.
[06:17.46]It's just like a square that has cheese texture in it.
[06:19.70]It kind of has like a hint of cheese flavor.
[06:23.31]Realistically, like Havarti on your sandwich is just like an extra 140 calories.
[06:28.45]But I like it though, and it melts really well.
[06:29.99]So it's nice and melty, ooey, cheesy, gooey, you know what I mean?
[06:34.12]You're stalling.
[06:35.04]Look, this is a late night stream.

[08:10.21]Here we go.
[08:12.20]A, B, C, D, E, B. What's your artist's name?
[08:17.62]How about... Jeremy.
[08:22.20]Jeremy the Great.
[08:25.87]Jeremy.
[08:27.73]Jerry.
[08:29.05]I'm your uncle, Jerry.
[08:30.01]Jerry.
[08:31.51]You're my uncle, Gary.
[08:32.87]You're my uncle, Jerry.
[08:35.21]Uh, Jerry.
[08:43.86]The year is 2130 and you have just received the result of your professional compatibility DNA test.
[08:50.78]Huh?
[08:52.34]Your genome indicates that you have a rare artistic talent.
[09:00.64]For decades, art has been... I feel like that would be way too stressful.
[09:03.82]That would put a ton of pressure on you your whole life.
[09:10.65]Can you imagine having you be like 12, 13, 14, 15 years old?
[09:15.79]It's like, hey, you know you have the rare artistic gene.
[09:18.23]You should be so good at art.
[09:20.27]Are you?
[09:21.59]And you haven't explored it yet?
[09:23.37]That would be so much pressure.
[09:25.69]What if you didn't think you did a good enough job?
[09:30.69]would freak me out for decades art's been largely dominated by robots and other artificial intelligence but in these times of artistic perfection and homogeneity the world of art has become stale and in need of renewal it is time for you to act as on Earth the threat of a robot revolt is rising what the is going on an alien species the crabux
[09:59.01]covet the planet's salt water.
[10:01.47]Only you can decide what to paint on your next canvas.
[10:03.97]What does this have to do with painting?
[10:06.73]We're being harvested by aliens?
[10:09.74]But so far, you have yet to be granted a studio aboard the International Space City.
[10:17.06]In order to get ready to revolutionize the world of art, and while waiting for your real studio, you have been provided with a virtual space of artistic simulation.
[10:27.11]You activate your holo headset and connect to your virtual studio.
[10:31.26]This isn't a VR game, right?
[10:32.84]This looks like you're about to go into a VR portion.
[10:35.56]Is this VR?
[10:36.26]I hope it's not.
[10:38.46]I didn't look.
[10:39.64]I didn't look.
[10:41.64]I didn't even look.
[10:42.92]Is it?
[10:47.10]Streamer menu.
[10:50.27]Oh, no.
[10:50.67]Hold on.
[10:51.25]I don't want to look.
[10:51.81]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:54.31]Did I lose connection?
[10:57.16]Nobody look.
[10:59.20]I don't want to spoil anything.
[11:00.06]Nobody look.
[11:06.99]Oh no, a red connection error.
[11:08.19]Hold on.
[11:09.83]Alright, there's no spoilers here.
[11:10.81]I thought there might be spoilers.
[11:11.77]There kind of is.
[11:17.53]Where's my... I don't have my cursor.
[11:18.77]Okay.
[11:22.19]Challenge my skills.
[11:23.49]Challenge my style.
[11:24.41]Boo me.
[11:26.85]Rate my painting.
[11:31.58]Have you just completed a painting or a challenge?
[11:33.54]Time to get booed.
[11:34.42]Did that do anything?
[11:39.64]I don't think the streamer menu works.
[11:50.12]I have a red connection error.
[11:51.36]Maybe it's not working right now.
[11:55.38]Oh, well.
[11:57.14]Should I just turn it off?
[12:01.00]Connect.
[12:02.76]You're not connected.
[12:03.86]Well, why not?
[12:09.47]Connect.
[12:11.97]You're connected.

[12:16.31]What do you guys think?
[12:16.93]Boo me.
[12:18.81]Boo or applaud?
[12:23.71]Only five of you have voted?
[12:28.07]Does it actually boo?
[12:31.03]Alright.
[12:31.71]Alright.
[12:34.89]This is acting like half the time that I have diarrhea.
[12:37.71]I just want to be clear.
[12:38.76]Should I stop and pull?
[12:42.72]Alright.
[12:46.46]Let's see what you guys say.
[12:48.08]This is too long to boo.
[12:51.97]Was that gross?
[12:53.75]That was kind of gross what I just said, isn't it?
[12:57.17]I have zero dollars.

[13:45.92]Cool.
[13:47.18]Press left control to crouch and paint the ugly floor.
[13:55.11]It's like a toddler.

[39:02.24]Put it down the drain.
[39:03.46]That shit's stuck there forever.
[39:06.48]Why is this water so cloudy?
[39:07.91]This is cloudy ass water.
[39:10.31]Look at this.
[39:12.49]This is the cloudiest water I've ever seen.

[81:30.95]Let's go. ...
[81:57.19]I'm just waiting for the mom to open the door and go, Jerry, what are you doing?
[82:03.13]And I turn, I've got like lipstick all over my face.
[82:05.99]I've got all of her clothes on.
[82:07.29]I got like a pair of dad's shoes on that are way too big for me.
[82:12.64]They're like eight sizes too big.
[82:16.54]Jerry!
[82:18.10]Where is she, mom?
[82:26.14]Cool.
[82:26.70]It made a really cool pattern.
[82:28.22]Look at the pattern it made!
[82:30.06]We need more.
[82:40.93]We need more paint.
[82:43.05]Give me... Spin it.
[82:49.41]No.
[82:49.61]I'm not gonna spin it.
[82:52.25]Because this symbolizes... This symbolizes, like, the insanity.
[82:57.44]And this is me trying to be as stoic and normal as possible while the sanity just flows over me.
[83:06.40]Insanity, I mean.
[83:11.00]In a true cubist, cubism fashion.
[83:15.09]I stand strong.
[83:19.41]While society just goes nuts, I try as hard as I can to stay cool and stay strong and stay locked.
[83:27.82]I'm getting hit by all the crazy shit going on.
[83:35.67]I kind of like what it did to the floor.
[83:39.73]No!
[83:40.31]Okay, I got it.

[83:42.81]Fuck.
[83:43.19]It's okay.
[83:45.69]That's the Joker.
[83:46.51]That's just for the Joker.
[83:53.50]I want a bucket of paint.
[83:54.56]I want to spray it everywhere.
[84:04.45]Isn't it fun to make a mess when that doesn't even matter?
[84:16.87]You're pretending this is some profound statement when you just don't actually know what cubism is.
[84:20.79]Oh, it's full.
[84:25.33]Okay.
[84:25.53]Okay.
[84:35.99]Oh yeah?
[84:38.03]You don't think I know what cubism is?
[84:50.10]Well.
[85:03.53]We call that an accident.
[85:05.92]That's not a happy accident.
[85:07.32]That is you've ruined the whole painting.
[85:11.27]Looks like it's red now.
[85:12.89]Okay.
[85:14.81]What do you think?
[85:18.25]Cubism.
[85:24.28]Shit.
[85:28.58]Okay.
[85:28.82]How do I wash?
[85:29.80]Can I just like press a button and have the sprinkler system come on?
[85:31.98]Because that's the only way this is getting clean.

[111:06.87]It's a ginger beer.
[111:09.11]Oh, you're urinating.

[111:25.36]Shut up.
[111:26.96]Fuck.
[111:30.69]Fuck up.
[111:35.78]What are you writing?
[111:39.67]Mr. Jeremy, sir.
[111:40.61]I'm going to read it until it gets fucking deleted from the mod.
[111:45.56]That's an easy, I can answer that.
[111:46.30]If you just go number one, you stand.
[111:47.12]If you go number two, you go number one after you go number two while you're sitting.
[112:23.43]That's correct.
[112:29.07]Yeah.
[112:31.24]You go number two and you're still sitting there.
[112:32.54]So it's like, alright, might as well do number one too.
[112:33.72]I'm right here.
[112:36.60]That's like a fact that if you don't do that, you're a liar.
[112:44.19]So wait, let me get this straight.
[112:45.77]You go shit, and then after you shit, you go, if you have to pee, you stand up and turn around and pee into the toilet.
[112:56.78]Can I understand that one?
[113:01.36]I'm confused.
[113:03.38]You go before, but what if you have to go?
[113:08.59]What if you have to go afterwards?
[113:09.67]What, are you just going to hold it?
[113:13.24]Is that such a big deal to pee while you're sitting down for a lot of you guys?
[113:17.66]You just don't go.
[113:21.73]What?
[113:26.37]You just don't go.
[113:30.21]Why?
[113:30.53]Toilet humor stream.
[113:33.67]No, this is not toilet.
[113:35.13]I'm actually curious if you guys are gaslighting or not.
[113:38.51]God, I'm so sick of being gaslit every day.
[113:42.88]What is this?
[113:43.24]Oh, I need that.
[113:46.80]Okay, so what colors do I want?
[113:48.08]I want to do... We'll do like a gray.
[113:53.40]We'll do a yellow.
[113:58.73]Yellow and other yellow.
[114:00.07]Mustard.
[114:02.23]Pink.
[114:03.73]And purple.
[114:05.41]Good.
[114:07.25]Okay, so let's go here.
[114:13.82]I gotta remember where these are.
[114:14.64]Okay.
[114:24.21]So that's purple and pink are on the left side.
[114:28.93]Mustard and yellow are in the middle and black's on the right.
[114:31.21]Okay.
[114:37.50]So paintbrush one is here.
[114:39.12]I need paintbrush.
[114:41.26]And this is another slot.
[114:43.14]What just happened?
[114:45.01]Yeah, I don't like the slots these are in.
[114:46.14]I know this is a lot of setup, but bear with me.
[114:53.10]I need water.
[114:53.72]Shit your pants right now.
[115:05.51]Had to do it.
[115:07.83]The person gave like 500 community subs.
[115:17.66]So this is going to be to my left.
[115:19.80]Oh, come on, dude.
[115:20.52]Really?
[115:21.02]What the fuck?
[115:29.83]Actually did it.
[115:30.49]Okay.
[115:36.81]So this is in.
[115:38.65]That's correct.
[115:39.19]Okay.
[115:39.42]So if I close my eyes.
[115:42.52]It's not close enough.
[115:43.02]It's got to be closer.
[115:46.91]Okay.
[115:48.15]There's the canvas.
[115:52.19]There it is.
[115:53.59]And then I've got my paints over here.
[115:54.79]Here we go.
[115:56.23]Alright.
[115:56.59]I'm going to start.
[115:57.27]Are you ready?
[116:00.21]I'm going to do... Let's just go for it.
[116:01.66]See if I can do something here.
[116:04.66]When do I close my eyes?
[116:05.34]Now?
[116:08.54]Should I close my eyes?
[116:10.32]Can I open them at all during the whole process?
[116:11.86]How long do I do this for?
[116:18.89]I don't have a time limit I guess until I'm ready set a timer alright what's the timer for five minutes I'll set a time for five minutes I just okay I almost just I almost just locked out my phone I just did the password wrong like five times I almost deleted my whole phone Jesus Christ okay uh let's do hmm
[116:49.66]Timer.
[116:52.62]My alarms are so fucked up.
[116:55.40]My alarms right now, I have one for 7 a.m., 8.30 a.m., and then 1.30 p.m.
[117:02.26]After 8.30, it's kind of just apparently just like, I guess, fuck it.
[117:05.06]I'm just going to stay asleep.
[117:08.41]Okay.
[117:09.45]Timer.
[117:10.59]Five minutes on the clock.
[117:14.27]Ready?
[117:15.33]Three, two, one, go!
[117:17.29]Oh!
[117:22.62]Oh, wait.
[117:29.42]I want the thick... Okay, one and two.
[117:31.16]Is this one?
[117:31.56]Do I have paint on?
[117:38.81]I don't even know if I have paint on.
[117:42.03]I think there's paint on this.
[117:49.53]I don't even know where I'm standing.
[117:54.37]I don't know where I'm standing.
[118:03.03]I heard something.
[118:08.55]Where's the paint?
[118:14.92]I don't know where I am.
[118:16.14]I gotta find the water bucket.
[118:28.27]I think I'm on the... I hear it.
[118:29.51]I don't know where the bucket is.
[118:36.81]I really have no idea where the bucket is.
[118:41.31]Did I move?
[118:46.77]Bucket!
[118:48.10]On the bucket.
[118:49.26]That means here's the canvas, which means here's the paint.
[119:03.41]I have no idea.
[119:04.13]What's happening?
[119:23.91]Is this the bucket of water?
[119:44.59]I don't know what the you grabbed paint sound is.
[119:58.60]Where's escape?
[119:59.76]Okay, this tilde is one.
[120:08.06]I hear like the... What was that?
[120:20.90]How long is it?
[120:21.50]It's been five minutes yet?
[120:22.34]I think I did something wrong.
[120:36.07]I think I just clicked something.
[120:44.54]I don't know where the bucket is.
[120:45.66]I gotta find the bucket again.
[120:51.61]That's the water bucket.
[120:54.60]So then this is the canvas.
[120:56.94]So then this is the fucking palette.
[121:02.07]Is this the palette to the right?
[121:06.22]Why is it making painting sounds?
[121:21.92]much time is left is my phone on silent can I wait hold on can I can I look at the phone make sure it's not on silent if I go like this hold on how long has it been can I look can I look at the phone please I don't even know what you're saying
[121:53.74]I'm painting something.
[121:54.74]It could be the ground.
[121:55.40]It could be a wall.
[121:55.86]I don't know.
[121:59.24]Where's my drink?
[121:59.76]This is the stupidest thing ever.
[122:03.56]Why would I just blindly reach for a drink?
[122:12.53]Why is that so hard to do with my eyes closed?
[122:14.09]It's not like my muscle memory changes.
[122:16.53]Do I need to see?
[122:17.29]Holy shit!
[122:22.97]I did it!
[122:32.32]I actually did it.
[122:40.87]What happened over here?
[122:47.66]How long has it been like that?
[122:48.66]I haven't had paint for like probably a long time.
[122:56.42]The whole time.
[122:57.24]Well, how did I get this?
[122:58.06]Alright, here you go.
[123:02.84]What do you think?
[123:18.27]I disconnected?
[123:18.73]I'm in.

[123:36.82]Game's not centered.
[123:39.24]Oh, it really isn't.
[123:40.42]How long has it happened like that for?
[123:43.87]Uh, I think this is broken.
[123:49.99]Yeah, this is fucked up.

[130:52.68]Great.
[130:53.60]Do you understand how hard this is going to be to get somebody to give me a real video?
[130:56.40]We have to wait for the next one.
[131:06.47]I guess I could just find it myself.
[131:11.16]Bob Ross.
[131:14.86]Okay, Bob Ross follow along painting.
[131:19.09]This one is called.
[131:19.85]In the midst of winter.
[131:27.93]In the midst of winter.
[131:28.69]This is the right one.
[131:33.96]No, I'm going to do in the midst of winter.
[131:35.44]I really hope I can do this.
[131:52.00]in the middle of winter is this one good grammar and spelling are important but not anymore you can just type it into this grammar thing and just it corrects literally every mistake you've ever made you can just fucking just who cares just mash your goddamn keyboard like a fucking piano doesn't matter send it your emails will all get fixed okay um let's get this in the same spot
[132:21.49]It undermines the writer's message and the word choice is bland.
[132:26.06]Right.
[132:34.65]Okay, here we go.
[132:35.23]Glad to see you today.
[132:37.15]Tell you what, let's get right on today and have them run all the colors across the screen that you need to paint along with us at home.
[132:43.03]While they're doing that, as usual, let me show you what I have.
[132:45.87]What do I need?
[132:46.23]Today I have my standard old pre-stretched double-prime canvas.
[132:49.86]And I've just covered it with a very thin coat of liquid white.
[132:52.66]That's all.
[132:53.24]It's wet and ready to go.
[132:54.36]So I thought today maybe we'd do a... Let's do a little winter scene.
[132:58.32]Something that's... Let's just see what happens.
[133:00.64]Let's start with black.
[133:02.38]Potato blue?
[133:03.26]Or blue and black.
[133:04.62]What?
[133:04.78]Black and blue and blue and black, black and blue and blue and black.
[133:07.28]I don't even have my paints!
[133:08.78]There we are.
[133:09.21]We'll just pop in a little sky here and there.
[133:11.33]Something about like so.
[133:12.11]I'm leaving some spots open intentionally.
[133:31.28]Just little spots.
[133:32.76]I don't want this to be a flat old dead sky.
[133:35.44]I want it to have some life, some action to it.
[133:38.82]Shoot.
[133:39.79]Maybe we can get a little crazy here.
[133:43.69]I've got several of these brushes.
[133:44.89]Mine just doesn't do that.
[133:46.47]Put a little touch.
[133:47.73]A little touch.
[133:48.79]Not much.
[133:49.75]A little touch.
[133:50.51]Of what color?
[133:51.11]Of alizarin crimson.
[133:53.61]I think that's on the ground.
[133:56.31]Just so it's not...
[133:57.85]Too bleak.
[133:59.11]Sometimes winter scenes can be very, very depressing.
[134:02.69]I'm going to put just a little pink in there just to give it a little warmth in the background.
[134:09.98]I don't want much.
[134:10.78]This looks like shit.
[134:11.48]I need my masher.
[134:12.08]I still want it to have a distinct winter taste to it.
[134:15.72]There we are.
[134:16.58]And we'll just lay some of that right down to the edge of that pink.
[134:23.20]And that's basically all it takes.
[134:25.38]Is that it?
[134:25.69]I did it?
[134:30.19]And that's good enough.
[134:31.41]That'll give us a sky that, as I say, it has a little life in it, some actions happening.
[134:35.49]It's not just a flat old dead sky.
[134:37.17]You can see light areas.
[134:39.25]And I like that in the sky.
[134:42.15]Shoot, that's working pretty good.
[134:43.13]Maybe we'll do the same thing down here.
[134:46.57]Shit!
[134:48.99]Anything that we don't... don't use... I should have done this in the beginning!
[134:54.54]If this is a winter scene, maybe we'll have some snow.
[134:56.94]You gotta have shadows in the snow.
[134:59.57]Or maybe it'll turn out to be water.
[135:02.44]Who knows?
[135:03.34]It doesn't matter.
[135:04.14]I'm doing pretty well.
[135:05.04]It doesn't matter.
[135:06.46]Because we can fix anything that can happen here.
[135:08.74]We don't concern ourselves with mistakes.
[135:12.12]We just have happy endings.
[135:13.36]What a fucking unbelievable person.
[135:15.86]I love this guy.
[135:16.74]Bob Ross is incredible.
[135:17.62]What a fucking joy of a human.
[135:21.14]You know what I mean?
[135:21.68]Seriously.
[135:22.38]I should have done this more often.
[135:24.63]I should do this like every fucking week.
[135:26.13]This feels good.
[135:29.07]If you've painted with me before, you know that's really the fun part of this.
[135:33.03]It's really the fun part.
[135:34.11]It's just washing the brush.
[135:35.59]It looks okay.
[135:36.79]There.
[135:37.27]It's a little too much in the middle.
[135:39.95]Isn't that fun?
[135:40.79]Oh, wait.
[135:41.07]I usually just wipe the brush on a paper towel to assure it's as dry as I can possibly get it.
[135:47.67]But you'd be surprised at how dry it gets just from beating it like that.
[135:51.71]Let's take black, Prussian blue, a little bunch of crimson.
[135:57.25]touch of crimson blue crimson crimson and I'm gonna get some white white just take a little bit of white okay I'm gonna mix up a little more blue in there a little more blue yeah yeah I wanted to have sort of a blue cast to it that's good oh I like that I like that that's looking good that's a good looking color okay yeah he just makes it till he gets to the flavor you
[136:21.89]My flavor is... It's sort of a drab blue color.
[136:26.74]It's not real bright.
[136:27.64]How much white?
[136:30.22]There.
[136:30.46]It's a nice winter color.
[136:33.96]Alright.
[136:34.30]Let's grab an old brush.
[136:36.34]Load it full of color.
[136:37.70]We'll use an old fan brush today.
[136:39.18]That looks... Back here.
[136:43.78]Somewhere in the background.
[136:46.58]See, this color is not...
[136:48.56]Wrong.
[136:48.96]Wrong.
[136:49.30]Wrong.
[136:49.78]Wrong.
[136:50.22]Wrong.
[136:50.40]Where's my paintbrush?
[136:50.99]Wrong.
[136:51.25]Where's my paintbrush?
[136:53.09]Wrong.
[136:53.73]Wrong.
[136:54.03]Where's my paintbrush?
[136:54.59]Wrong.
[136:55.19]Where's the brush?
[136:55.67]Where's it?
[136:56.73]Where's the brush?
[136:57.25]Where's my paintbrush?
[136:57.93]Where's my paintbrush?
[136:58.63]Where's my fucking paintbrush?
[136:59.45]Goddammit.
[136:59.77]I gotta pause this.
[137:00.25]Okay.
[137:00.39]Paused.
[137:00.53]Where's my paintbrush?
[137:27.15]Alright.
[137:28.37]Good.
[137:29.97]So that needs to be this.
[137:30.95]A little more crimson.
[137:39.24]A little more blue.
[137:41.00]A little more gray.
[137:42.38]A little more white.
[137:46.77]I think we're there.
[137:48.77]I think we're there.
[137:49.81]Here we go.
[137:50.53]On pause.
[137:51.49]I need black.
[137:52.21]Okay.
[137:52.43]Yeah.
[137:52.61]Black too.
[138:00.47]Squish this down here.
[138:03.59]Black.
[138:04.03]Okay.
[138:05.31]How's that look?
[138:07.89]That's very wintry.
[138:10.05]I think I got it.
[138:10.52]A little bit more.
[138:12.58]There we go.
[138:12.88]That's it.
[138:13.18]That's the one right there.
[138:13.78]That's it.
[138:14.10]I got it.
[138:14.38]That's the one.
[138:16.36]I'm good.
[138:16.62]Let's go.
[138:22.48]Alright.
[138:22.84]Let's grab an old brush.
[138:24.49]An old brush.
[138:24.95]Where's it going?
[138:25.49]Okay.
[138:28.98]Maybe in our world, back here.
[138:31.02]I don't know what's going on.
[138:32.34]Somewhere in the background.
[138:35.12]See, this color is not far away from the color that's already on the canvas.
[138:41.68]Let's just push upward today and make us a little tree.
[138:45.76]There.
[138:46.06]It's pretty close to the color that's on the canvas.
[138:48.48]And that's what we're looking for.
[138:49.46]I don't want it too much farther away.
[138:53.44]Pretty close.
[138:54.08]Pretty close.
[138:58.57]Maybe another little tree right there.
[139:01.06]And you decide how many trees live in your world.
[139:03.16]It's up to you.
[139:04.00]Totally and completely.
[139:04.84]Well, I only did one.
[139:08.08]As you've probably heard me say before, to me, that's what's so fantastic about painting is that each and every person will paint differently.
[139:16.45]And that's what makes it special.
[139:18.39]If we all painted the same way, what a boring time it would be.
[139:21.90]See?
[139:22.14]Yeah, that's right.
[139:22.98]You would know what the finished painting was going to be before you start.
[139:25.90]That's right.
[139:27.18]He's right.
[139:27.60]Because people are different.
[139:29.16]Paintings are different.
[139:31.48]That's the beauty of it.
[139:32.72]It really is.
[139:33.37]It makes it very special.
[139:37.34]It allows you to show your individuality.
[139:41.64]There.
[139:45.28]How many trees do we want here?
[139:47.08]It's up to you.
[139:47.78]You decide.
[139:48.82]You decide.
[139:49.88]Maybe one.
[139:50.80]We're like five.
[139:51.80]Maybe just want a few.
[139:54.78]Maybe there's a little baby one right there.
[139:56.74]He's not so big yet.
[139:58.96]Make up little stories.
[140:00.54]People look at you like you're a little strange, but that's alright.
[140:03.96]Painters are expected to be different.
[140:07.04]I love Bob Ross.
[140:07.82]Expressionist trees.
[140:08.64]I don't have a real paintbrush.
[140:14.62]What the fuck is that thing?
[140:15.94]Softly, softly disappear over here.
[140:36.84]I want these trees to just sort of look like they're just sitting in a little misty area.
[140:41.42]Just breathing in the cold air.
[140:43.90]There we go.
[140:45.64]Something like that.
[140:49.00]I fixed it.
[140:51.88]Now we have a whole bunch of trees in the background.
[140:55.36]It's very misty, cold looking, and already you have the impression of winter.
[141:00.68]That easy.
[141:02.57]Mine looks like a forest burnt down.
[141:04.38]This doesn't look like... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[141:07.04]Which is white?
[141:07.94]See there?
[141:31.61]We just let it sort of disappear over here.
[141:33.65]We don't care.
[141:35.71]We don't care.
[141:36.43]Fuck!
[141:37.45]Wrong way.
[141:38.69]That easy.
[141:40.69]But isn't that fantastic?
[141:42.70]Why are you doing that?
[141:44.76]Snow is one of the easier things to paint in this technique.
[141:49.14]Okay.
[141:51.00]Barn in there Where's my scraping tool?
[141:52.89]Where's my scraper?
[141:54.53]Where's the fucking scraper?
[142:16.12]I've been using this the whole time.
[142:17.58]Decide what kind of old barn we want.
[142:20.65]Maybe it comes down like that.
[142:23.29]Maybe it has a place over here for the cow to sleep.
[142:26.85]It doesn't matter.
[142:27.87]You decide.
[142:28.55]Barns come in all kinds of shapes.
[142:31.35]Where's the scraper?
[142:32.43]Farmers are like painters.
[142:34.25]They do it their way.
[142:36.29]Wait, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[142:37.54]Pause it.
[142:37.84]What's so great about being a farmer in this fantastic country?
[142:43.42]But isn't that fantastic?
[142:44.94]That looks so good.
[142:45.82]Okay, pause it.
[142:47.82]Where's the scraper?
[142:51.18]Can somebody help me out here?
[142:52.71]Where's the scraper?
[143:00.19]Behind you on the table.
[143:09.02]Where is it?
[143:15.27]This is a Dora moment.
[143:16.59]I don't know where it is.
[143:17.31]I threw it a long time ago.
[143:21.56]I whipped it across the room a very long time ago.
[143:27.24]And this place is filthy, so I have no idea where the scraper is.
[143:34.16]Where is it?
[143:35.88]You're throwing for views.
[143:37.35]I don't know where the scraping tool is.
[143:41.59]Does anybody see the scraping tool?
[143:56.38]Does this work?
[144:01.92]It's under the elevator.
[144:05.06]Wait a sec, what do you mean under the elevator?
[144:06.69]The fuck am I gonna do without the scraping tool?
[144:16.41]It's near the spoon, I just saw it.
[144:23.56]Big canvas.
[144:36.26]Left corner.
[144:39.46]I don't think it's even still here.
[144:41.18]Can I get another one?
[144:46.03]I looked right at it.
[144:46.83]Did I?
[144:49.01]Under the lift.
[144:54.53]You mean under this?
[145:01.16]There it is.
[145:02.92]Alright, I got my scraping tool.
[145:03.86]I'm good.
[145:04.30]Alright, Bob.
[145:04.60]What are we doing?
[145:05.76]Let's do it.
[145:07.48]Snow is one of the easier things to paint in this technique.
[145:11.86]Okay.
[145:13.70]You ready for a little fun today?
[145:15.94]Let's go.
[145:17.00]Tell you what, we filmed this show in Indiana, and there's a lot of old barns here that just fascinate me.
[145:23.58]Let's paint an old barn today.
[145:26.18]One of the easiest ways is to scrape out a basic shape.
[145:30.02]Just sort of scrape it out.
[145:32.38]It doesn't have to be exact, and you're not committed.
[145:36.53]I'm not committed here.
[145:38.83]So let's just decide what kind of old barn we want.
[145:43.37]Maybe it comes down like that.
[145:45.99]Maybe it has a place over here for the cow to sleep.
[145:49.58]It doesn't matter.
[145:50.62]You decide.
[145:51.50]This is just a bigger tree.
[145:55.26]Alright, I made a perspective tree.
[145:59.52]Yeah, that's what's so great about being a farmer in this fantastic country.
[146:04.82]You can do it your way.
[146:07.12]That's alright.
[146:07.76]I have a lot of friends here that are farmers.
[146:12.74]Got to get a brownie point in with them, because they got the best food, and I like to eat.
[146:18.48]Alright, on the other side, about the same distance here.
[146:22.92]We'll just scrape out.
[146:23.72]I hope you can see.
[146:24.68]There's just a basic, basic... That thing sucks!
[146:27.50]And as I mentioned earlier, you are not committed.
[146:29.70]Van Dyke brown, dark sienna.
[146:31.92]You can change your mind at this point.
[146:34.07]A little roll of paint.
[146:36.05]Now let's begin picking out the little things in here.
[146:40.33]There's the back eave.
[146:42.28]I didn't paint it!
[146:43.32]Okay, now then.
[146:47.48]The old barn comes down.
[146:50.58]Gotta make those noises.
[146:53.52]There it is, see?
[146:55.46]All we're doing here is blocking in a little color.
[146:57.92]We'll come back and do a barn-ectomy after a while and cut it off wherever we want it.
[147:02.06]But right now, all we're doing is putting in the dark.
[147:06.56]Putting in some dark color.
[147:09.05]There.
[147:10.61]Here we go.
[147:11.35]Bloop. Bloop. Doop. Doop. Bloop. Bloop.
[147:18.85]Me too! I go: ???
[147:33.35]Right in here would be a little dark paint.
[147:38.05]Okay.
[147:38.67]Now, let's take some white, dark sienna, a little van dyke in there.
[147:50.55]I'm done.
[147:51.37]A little crimson, too.
[147:52.35]What the heck?
[147:53.62]Give it a little warm feeling.
[147:55.72]Don't overmix the paint.
[147:58.54]Cut off a little roll of paint.
[148:01.02]Then we can go up in here.
[148:02.38]Shit.
[148:02.84]And just barely touch.
[148:04.70]Just let it graze.
[148:05.58]See?
[148:06.22]Let it graze.
[148:06.90]Looks like old, old wood.
[148:10.02]If you've painted barns and cabins and stuff before.
[148:12.50]What happened here?
[148:13.30]What happened in mine?
[148:17.21]I'm an avid collector of antique glass, for example.
[148:20.65]I like old things.
[148:23.25]When you get my age, you have a tendency to like old things.
[148:25.85]You can relate to them.
[148:28.25]I need a thinner brush.
[148:31.86]It's not going to work.
[148:32.36]It's not going to work.
[148:32.98]I need a thicker brush, but I need a thinner brush.
[148:35.92]It's too thin, but it's too thick.
[148:37.58]Raid song.
[148:38.02]What?
[148:38.16]What happened?
[148:38.68]Who raided?
[149:04.68]Another fucking monster raid?
[149:06.72]Who raided?
[149:07.54]I can't even see.
[149:11.04]What's up, Coney?
[149:12.18]Thanks for the raid.
[149:14.94]Welcome, everybody.
[149:19.12]Shitload of you.
[149:19.92]What's going on, Coney?
[149:24.10]Coney?
[149:24.96]Am I saying this wrong?
[149:27.59]I'm saying this wrong?
[149:28.73]Oh my god, I'm such a shithead.
[149:30.91]Let's take some titanium white.
[149:34.41]I got it.
[149:36.01]I got it.
[149:36.57]I got it.
[149:36.91]Well, thank you.
[149:37.59]Welcome, guys.
[149:39.57]Today, we're... I guess I don't even... Do I have to explain what's happening?
[149:44.95]I mean, I think this is very clear that I'm just... This is just a complete bogus... This is not working well.
[149:49.93]But thanks for the break.
[149:50.55]Welcome, guys.
[149:51.36]Hope you had a good stream.
[149:53.10]What happened to the... There's no paint on this.
[150:01.77]This actually looks not... This is very bad.
[150:04.01]This is very bad.
[150:04.79]Happy accidents.
[150:05.29]Well, what happens when they're all accidents?
[150:07.05]What happens if you only have accidents?
[150:10.30]Then when you pull it...
[150:30.34]I need purple there, and I need white up here.
[150:32.50]This looks like an old book.
[150:38.40]This is like an old shitty tomb that you found in, like, your grandfather's attic.
[150:41.46]There's like a bunch of spells in this.
[150:44.56]I don't know what to do about this.
[150:45.48]I fucked up this angle.
[150:47.98]I don't know how.
[150:49.36]Let's take some Van Dyke.
[150:58.17]Decide where your door lives, and once again, don't worry about the bottom.
[151:03.31]We're going to do a barnectomy, as I mentioned earlier.
[151:07.58]We'll cut this rascal off wherever we want it to be.
[151:10.92]I need a door.
[151:12.92]Which is about time to do now.
[151:15.66]Let's say the old barn right along in there.
[151:20.44]See?
[151:23.18]That's Salad Fingers' house.
[151:24.54]That's who lives there.
[151:25.36]Okay.
[151:25.80]What do I do now?
[151:26.38]Wait.
[151:26.58]These little speckles down here.
[151:27.96]Let's go up in here.
[151:49.74]And we'll put another plane.
[151:51.42]Come right in there.
[151:54.74]There we are.
[151:55.96]Watch that brown snow.
[151:57.28]You know what they say about it.
[151:59.98]There we are.
[152:03.10]Down in there.
[152:04.76]I got to pad it.
[152:05.36]Over here on the other side.
[152:06.80]We'll just bring it right up.
[152:10.10]Like that.
[152:12.82]When in doubt, just like mush this fucking thing down.
[152:15.36]And it looks kind of like you did it on purpose.
[152:17.28]That easy.
[152:19.31]Once again, snow is so easy to paint when you're using the big old two-inch brush.
[152:23.07]I actually don't hate this.
[152:23.99]So easy to paint.
[152:28.09]This actually, this doesn't look that bad, actually, now that I look at it.
[152:33.43]Find us a place to work with the old palette.
[152:36.83]Got to have a big palette.
[152:38.57]Big palette.
[152:39.05]What's he doing?
[152:39.48]Very, very helpful.
[152:42.16]It's almost as important as having a, well, it's having...
[152:46.74]An easel that holds your paint.
[152:49.36]You okay?
[152:49.88]You're painting firmly.
[152:51.70]You're gonna cough?
[152:52.50]You're gonna sneeze?
[152:54.10]You really need a good... You alright?
[152:56.22]My toe?
[152:58.00]You okay?
[152:58.54]He was just going like... He's supposed to like sneeze or cough.
[153:03.65]You good?
[153:04.39]He's okay.
[153:04.89]Right on the brush.
[153:06.81]Missed it.
[153:07.09]What happened?
[153:07.69]Blue, black, brown, a little crimson.
[153:10.19]A little crimson.
[153:11.33]All in good colors.
[153:12.79]A little crimson in there.
[153:13.61]What did he just do?
[153:17.21]Here we go.
[153:18.15]Maybe right here.
[153:20.49]I'll put a little paint thinner.
[153:21.95]Just to thin the paint.
[153:22.73]It's a little thick.
[153:25.33]When you paint just a little bit, pretty soon you begin to get a feel for it when it touches.
[153:29.07]If it don't want to pull just right, then you can add a little... That's a lightning.
[153:33.45]Don't do that unless you have to.
[153:36.09]I just knew the paint wasn't going to come off the brush unless I did.
[153:38.43]I guess it's going to be darker.
[153:40.67]I'm going to have a happy little tree.
[153:42.45]He lives right there.
[153:43.76]Darker.
[153:44.04]Darker.
[153:46.55]Right on the side of the barn.
[153:48.21]Let's go on the other side over here.
[153:50.81]You know me.
[153:52.41]Bravery test, here we go.
[153:54.21]Bigger tree.
[153:55.69]Big old tree.
[153:57.25]I like these evergreens.
[153:59.54]They're so much fun to make.
[154:02.52]And they're very simple.
[154:03.88]Very, very simple.
[154:05.14]Takes a little practice like everything else.
[154:06.96]Everything in your life takes a little practice.
[154:10.47]Mine looks pretty good.
[154:11.07]Fuck out of the way.
[154:11.79]What am I painting with?
[154:12.77]Acrylic?
[154:13.01]I know what that is.
[154:13.61]They just have a richness.
[154:39.28]Other mediums to me are very flat when they're dry.
[154:44.59]There.
[154:47.03]And they're harder.
[154:48.33]This is the easiest, because it's very forgiving.
[154:50.97]You can't make a mistake here.
[154:53.85]Alright, let's take some of that nice gray color we had.
[155:00.63]This don't look half bad.
[155:01.67]Now there's a bunch of trees covering all the shitty things I did.
[155:03.83]Maybe there's a little path that just works its way out.
[155:08.99]Just works its way out here.
[155:10.99]Oh, shit.
[155:12.70]Something about like that.
[155:13.96]We just put some gray in there so it can come right on out.
[155:23.92]When in doubt, mash it.
[155:25.49]Let's clean off another spot.
[155:27.77]I'm running out of room today.
[155:31.10]Running out of room.
[155:33.34]There we go.
[155:35.26]Now, I'll take liquid white, titanium white, and phthalo blue.
[155:42.80]I changed the blue.
[155:43.78]I've been using... Titanium white, liquid white, and titanium blue, whatever that was.
[155:48.91]Because I want to highlight these trees, and the phthalo blue will stand out a little bit.
[155:55.76]That looks really, really good.
[155:57.50]Not mine, but his.
[155:58.44]Omeglel.
[155:58.64]Command.
[155:59.08]Focus on your face.
[155:59.76]What?
[156:19.71]you have to decide which trees in the foreground I think the small one here is so you do the one what oh my god what actually good what is good and a little tree over here don't forget somebody just made this this is this is good
[156:51.21]That's pretty good.
[156:56.36]That's really good.
[156:57.12]Nice job.
[156:59.78]Is it the other?
[157:00.71]You need to click this link.
[157:23.42]What the fuck?
[157:33.53]Not edited.
[157:49.21]Oh my fucking god.
[158:05.35]Hmm.
[158:10.25]Okay.
[158:15.49]Let's go.
[158:16.17]Keep going.
[158:17.47]We only got like five minutes left.
[158:32.70]He gets sad.
[158:35.51]Oh!
[158:35.69]I saw it!
[158:36.13]Don't take it off!
[158:37.94]It's nice and frosty.
[158:39.34]Titanium white.
[158:40.98]Is this gonna ruin it?
[159:11.48]is neat.
[159:14.00]These whole winter scenes are a lot of fun and I really think they might be the easiest ones to do.
[159:20.41]There we are.
[159:20.91]Fucking hell yeah.
[159:22.27]What do you got here?
[159:23.31]We just blend that a little bit until it looks nice and soft and pretty.
[159:29.49]Alright, let's go.
[159:30.13]And this little tree over here.
[159:33.26]I'm intentionally grabbing some of that dark color.
[159:37.90]See, we'll put him up on a little hill, sort of.
[159:40.48]That easy.
[159:40.94]That's not gonna be white, right?
[159:41.84]See, he sort of sits up high.
[159:44.06]Isn't that neat?
[159:44.94]But just by pulling some of that color, you can create that illusion.
[159:49.26]It's unbelievable to have this kind of power.
[159:52.68]Unbelievable.
[159:56.17]There we go.
[159:59.31]It's a blustery day.
[160:00.15]It's coming right along there, maybe.
[160:01.49]There we go.
[160:05.37]You just decide where your little path is.
[160:11.07]Like that, I like it.
[160:12.21]Right there, right there.
[160:12.83]My path is fine.
[160:13.51]It has the gray on it.
[160:17.15]And just polish the edges up a little bit, however you want them.
[160:22.02]We can just go back and forth and work this until it gets just what we consider perfect.
[160:28.62]For the roof.
[160:29.96]Sometimes it's nice to just pop in a little dooder here.
[160:34.48]What did he say?
[160:35.10]Pop in a what?
[160:36.79]Lift it up.
[160:38.49]Make it look like little bushes and weeds live in there.
[160:42.97]Maybe there's one coming out here.
[160:44.31]I don't know.
[160:45.33]You decide.
[160:46.81]You decide where they are.
[160:48.51]But you have little patches of bushes and sticks and wigs, limbs and twigs that grow everywhere.
[160:55.01]There we go.
[160:57.19]See?
[160:57.87]Alright.
[160:59.67]Ooh!
[161:00.60]Ready to get crazy?
[161:01.46]Let's take some Van Dyke Brown.
[161:03.30]Van Dyke Brown?
[161:04.56]Mostly Van Dyke Brown.
[161:05.72]Mostly Van Dyke Brown.
[161:06.66]Do I have Van Dyke Brown?
[161:07.54]I don't even have brown.
[161:09.00]Brown doesn't have a color here.
[161:10.32]What is this?
[161:12.57]We're going to make it.
[161:14.02]We're going to make Van Dyke Brown.
[161:17.72]Is that Van Dyke Brown?
[161:21.42]Is this Van Dyke Brown?
[161:22.38]Okay, let's give him a friend.
[161:23.92]Let's give him a friend.
[161:28.40]There.
[161:30.76]Something about like him.
[161:33.42]Maybe.
[161:35.19]Maybe this is an old birch tree that lives out here.
[161:38.09]It's up to you.
[161:39.60]Wow, why did that fucking happen?
[161:41.30]I got actually visibly mad about that.
[161:43.98]Doesn't matter.
[161:48.14]There.
[161:50.27]Something like so.
[161:53.69]There we are.
[161:55.89]It's hard to believe this is the 31st series of the Joy of Painting.
[162:00.45]Good gosh.
[162:01.07]Holy shit, that looks so good.
[162:03.37]It's almost unreal.
[162:05.25]Almost.
[162:07.00]I want to thank you for...
[162:09.63]allowing us to come to you for this long.
[162:12.59]We've been doing this show now for well over 11 years.
[162:15.57]I need white.
[162:17.81]I need white.
[162:18.21]I need white, white, white, white, white, white, white.
[162:19.49]And you've made me feel very special to invite me into your home and to let me be part of your family.
[162:26.14]Thank you very much.
[162:26.88]I can do it.
[162:29.12]If you hadn't got to see all the shows in your area and you would like to, give your station a call.
[162:35.28]They're available to them.
[162:38.12]They're available to them.
[162:39.50]Or if you want to see some of them over again, let them know.
[162:43.82]It's the only way they know.
[162:44.76]A little brown to paint them here.
[162:47.32]I'm just going to put on some little limbs.
[162:49.85]It's too cold for there to be any leaves on here.
[162:54.23]They went to Florida.
[162:55.05]Oh, shit.
[162:55.29]There's leaves.
[162:56.77]No, leaves don't go to Florida.
[162:57.93]They just fall off the tree.
[162:58.97]I know.
[162:59.31]Somebody will write and tell me they're not there.
[163:02.19]I didn't hold it over there.
[163:03.33]I need to add limbs.
[163:05.21]What did I do with my paintbrush?
[163:06.55]Where are you?
[163:08.56]Where's the fucking paintbrush?
[163:11.02]Where's the fucking paintbrush?
[163:13.81]Where's the fucking paintbrush?
[163:16.11]Where's the paintbrush?
[163:16.97]No, the other paintbrush.
[163:20.43]I'm not holding it.
[163:21.09]No, no, pause it.
[163:22.19]Where the white paint is.
[163:44.91]Jeremy, why?
[163:46.19]I'm sorry.
[163:46.65]Where is it?
[163:47.19]This is a fucking hidden object game.
[163:56.21]That was a hidden object game.
[163:57.35]Give me a break.
[163:58.45]That was a hidden object game.
[164:01.66]Okay, let's go back.
[164:02.36]He wants to do limbs on here.
[164:04.62]With the titanium brown, whatever it is.
[164:06.86]Ooh.
[164:09.74]Ooh.
[164:21.43]Okay, a few more little limbs here.
[164:24.25]Shoot, I think we're about to the point we got this rascal.
[164:28.45]Looking pretty good.
[164:32.25]Maybe, maybe there's a little stick right in there.
[164:35.58]I don't know.
[164:38.86]Maybe, let's go right over in here.
[164:40.90]Maybe over in here we can put the indication of just a few little twigs and sticks and things that are living everywhere.
[164:48.96]Something about like that.
[164:52.02]Shoot, I think with that, we've gone heaven finished painting.
[164:54.04]Let's take a little bread, and we'll sign this rascal.
[164:57.34]I really hope you've enjoyed this little painting.
[164:59.50]I hope you'll try it.
[165:01.66]It'll give you a lot of experience using the equipment, and with experience comes confidence.
[165:08.34]With confidence, you know you can do anything that you believe you can do.
[165:12.27]There it is.
[165:12.99]From all of us here until next time.
[165:14.93]I did it.
[165:16.91]God bless, my friend.
[165:21.23]I did it.
[165:38.19]It's not bad.
[165:40.69]Too bad I can't do the poll.
[165:49.13]I wish I could do the vote.
[165:50.39]Let me try to connect it again.
[165:52.59]You are connected.
[165:53.73]Shit, I'm not connected though.
[165:58.07]Oh well.
[165:59.79]Actually good?
[166:00.57]It's alright.
[166:06.86]Let's sell it on the marketplace.
[166:13.58]Go ahead.
[166:14.60]Sell it to... Wait, what do you want?
[166:17.06]Sell it for as much as I can possibly get.
[166:20.34]$400.
[166:20.56]Don't keep it.
[166:24.05]What?
[166:24.25]Why?
[166:32.97]That's tea?
[166:34.23]Nah, it's all messed up.
[166:35.90]It got disconnected and reconnected and it's all fucked up.
[166:41.14]Put it on the fridge.
[166:41.72]I have one to do here.
[166:48.19]What do I want to do here?
[166:50.99]I'm just going to go wild with this one.
[166:55.37]Alright.
[166:55.77]Alright.
[166:56.19]The first thing I see in chat is what we're doing.
[167:00.55]First thing I see, I'm looking for a inspiration.
[167:02.99]I'm going to say three things.
[167:05.63]Okay.
[167:05.91]We got green pickle.
[167:06.95]Okay, good.
[167:07.52]I might did green already.
[167:08.58]No.
[167:08.98]The next one.
[167:11.16]A bear.
[167:11.64]Okay.
[167:12.14]Bear.
[167:12.40]Where's the bear?
[167:13.98]Where is the bear?
[167:19.62]At a waterfall.
[167:20.18]Alright, buried at a waterfall.
[167:22.10]What time is it?
[167:22.68]Time of day.
[167:24.24]Night or day?
[167:29.10]Morning.
[167:29.72]Okay.
[167:30.99]Morning.
[167:31.89]Buried at a waterfall in the morning.
[167:36.65]I have to clean.
[167:37.51]This is a joke.
[167:40.97]It's time.
[167:41.55]I gotta clean up.
[167:42.07]This is ridiculous.
[167:42.97]I wanted to... Give me a moment.
[167:47.47]This is absurd.
[167:49.99]You know, throw all this shit in the corner.
[167:57.50]Okay.
[167:57.86]I'm going to clean up.
[168:01.22]Draw.
[168:01.50]Do Peter Griffin.
[168:03.94]No, I'm doing a barrier to waterfall in the morning.
[168:05.96]That's what I did.
[168:07.18]Come on.
[168:07.46]It's improv.
[168:08.92]Painting improv.
[168:13.58]Throw it in the trash chute.
[168:14.58]There's no trash chute.
[168:18.24]Here we go.
[168:20.31]Make the bear Peter.
[168:25.47]Just give him like a white shirt and the green pants and glasses.
[168:38.22]I think they already did that, guys.
[168:39.56]This is something that has already happened.
[168:54.26]Remember that time when I was a bear?
[168:55.62]Oh, no.
[168:57.84]Remember that time I was attacked by a bear?
[168:59.64]No, no.
[169:00.82]Remember that time he got attacked by a bear at one point, right?
[169:11.88]It was a chicken.
[169:12.46]No.
[169:13.46]Look, he's been attacked by every animal.
[169:22.43]But this is different mediums.
[169:32.22]This is different mediums, guys.
[169:33.74]I don't understand.
[169:35.98]This is a different medium.
[169:37.02]I'm on this computer game.
[169:48.53]I thought if it was the same game...
[169:53.37]That was the wrong link.
[170:03.64]There is no meme or anything.
[170:04.54]You just look particularly handsome today.
[170:06.44]That hairstyle really suits you.
[170:10.20]That chat said that.
[170:11.24]Hey, thanks.
[170:13.63]Hey, thanks.
[170:18.95]Hey, thanks.
[170:24.62]Brew.
[170:25.30]Thanks, guys.
[170:28.18]Look at this confidence boost you're giving me.
[170:30.24]Thanks for the confidence boost.
[170:33.44]I was about to just put my finger in my nose and fucking, like, suck on it.
[170:36.28]I don't know.
[170:37.67]Just trying to make myself, like, uglier.
[170:44.99]I'm thinking about doing it.
[170:45.99]I really am.
[170:46.53]I'm seriously considering it.
[170:51.89]Everyone that, like, thinks I'm, like, handsome, if I, like, eat boogers on stream, you're not gonna think that anymore.
[170:55.70]You know what I mean?
[170:56.78]You're gonna be like, holy shit, that's fucking disgusting.
[170:58.58]Never mind.
[170:58.94]Maybe I should do it.
[171:08.77]More handsome if I do that.
[171:15.69]Alright, what am I doing?
[171:17.73]What was happening?
[171:19.47]Oh, I was cleaning, right.
[171:21.12]I was cleaning up.
[171:27.91]I look so zoomed in.
[171:28.63]Why?
[171:33.15]Bear in the morning in a waterfall.
[171:34.47]That's what it was.
[171:34.95]I have a booger eating stream.
[171:44.08]No.
[171:48.98]I don't think so.
[171:52.44]How did this get up here?
[171:56.67]I don't remember even this.
[171:57.49]How did this even happen?
[171:58.55]How did that get up there?
[172:02.49]Oh, the blow dryer, right.
[172:08.29]Let me state this one more time for the people that may have just trickled in here.
[172:13.99]I have paid for games that had like way less shit in it than this one.
[172:22.42]And this is just like a free demo.
[172:28.95]You can just like... You just load this up and just draw and paint and just fuck around and throw stuff around.
[172:36.82]I'm going to have to give this a full 100% recommended download.
[172:42.46]Pretty rare to get that from me.
[172:44.52]That's pretty rare.
[172:48.60]And I hold myself to such a much higher standard than everybody else.
[173:04.60]We're on music?
[173:05.14]Yeah, this is kind of just me scratching it, like... This is just me scratching my ass.
[173:15.32]Hold on, guys.
[173:15.88]I'm gonna take a quick little break.
[173:43.90]Poison sumac!
[173:46.40]It sucks!
[173:51.24]You have no fucking idea how itchy this is!
[174:07.43]No more crack!
[174:10.70]There's no crack today.
[174:12.00]I'm just chilling out.
[174:12.94]This is a relaxing stream.
[174:22.21]I told you, this is a late night stream.
[174:23.63]This is a late night relaxed paint stream.
[174:25.77]I told you what you were going to get from this.
[174:33.24]Today.
[174:33.66]It is today.
[174:34.62]It's 10 o'clock Pacific.
[174:36.66]What time is it where you are?
[174:42.01]I thought this was a green wall.
[174:43.29]I really thought this was a green wall.
[174:45.69]It was not a green wall.
[174:46.45]This is like a gray wall.
[174:50.63]1 a.m.?
[174:52.90]Well, it's because of West Coast.
[174:56.06]Best Coast.
[175:14.93]He's an East Coast traitor.
[175:16.65]I did used to live on the East Coast.
[175:21.43]You're right.
[175:22.47]Nobody even said that.
[175:23.21]I just made that person up.
[175:27.77]Coming along.
[175:30.49]Absolute cringe.
[175:33.95]What's the cringiest thing I've... No, never mind.
[175:35.77]Fuck that.
[175:36.15]We're not doing that.
[175:40.04]Not doing that.
[175:40.64]Mm-mm.
[175:43.48]Never mind.
[175:44.31]I'm going to stop that one before it right in its tracks.
[175:46.37]Do a cringe where it's pre-recorded.
[175:58.48]I already did like two minutes ago.
[176:12.66]People playing Battleship yet?
[176:22.08]No?
[176:29.30]Ooh, nice and clean.
[176:29.98]This dude's drunk.
[176:48.35]I'm just making a trash corner.
[176:52.08]I have to clean up.
[176:52.98]It's freaking me out.
[176:54.22]I need to clean.
[177:01.56]Nice Jerm of reference poser.
[177:03.14]Am I a poser if it's me?
[177:08.14]What if I'm the one saying it?
[177:13.83]Yes.
[177:19.81]Yes.
[177:23.15]What was there?
[177:31.16]I'm going to miss a spot and someone's going to be really, really upset.
[177:33.56]This background is ridiculous.

[191:55.81]But you have to move around.
[191:57.99]If I could put a VR helmet on right now and have a mannequin of me walking around the house while I had VR connected to the mannequin, the Android me, and just sat here at the desk and just like cleaned the house, I would do it.
[192:10.34]That would be awesome.
[192:14.42]You know how much shit I would get done if I could just put a VR headset on and just go with the Android guy of me?
[192:22.25]I would go to the bank.
[192:23.85]I would fold all my laundry.
[192:25.89]I would do everything.
[192:27.77]It would be so awesome.
[192:30.09]I would get so much done.
[192:44.54]What chores do you want to do at the bank?
[192:47.12]I don't know.
[192:47.54]Go to the bank and make a deposit or withdraw.
[192:50.65]I don't know.
[192:58.76]It's errands.
[192:59.44]Yeah.
[193:09.80]No, not like you.
[193:15.30]Not robbing the bank.
[193:17.58]Robbing the bank with the headset on as me, Android me.
[193:26.49]How many people would just, like, not know what they were doing if that was the case?
[193:29.33]You, like, get in there and you're, like, getting... Think about how you see people move around in VR.
[193:34.04]People would just get, like, run over by cars.
[193:37.86]Like, oh, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go out and do some errands.
[193:40.56]I'm gonna go to Target.
[193:42.12]And they would, like... They wouldn't even be able to get out of the front door.
[193:44.94]They would, like, bump into the walls.
[193:46.26]They would, like, trip over.
[193:47.20]They would, like, open the... They would open the door to the front door to their house and, like, hit themselves in the fucking face and the android would break.
[193:54.80]No one would be able to even do this.
[194:01.41]You would just look around and there'd be people just all around your neighborhood, just like throwing glass bottles into the ground.
[194:07.75]And you'd hear laughter in all the houses, like in all the windows.
[194:10.83]You'd hear like... Like, oh, right, okay.
[194:18.21]You would hear like... Oh!
[194:22.04]And, like, you'd look over and the guy's, like, bumped and he just stops.
[194:25.50]Like, Bill, your neighbor's android just, like, stops.
[194:28.50]Stopped moving for a second.

[200:08.90]People are probably going to hate it because it's facing the wrong way.
[200:18.17]It should be official.
[200:22.47]I don't think it should.
[200:39.29]Og Champ.
[200:41.21]Slug Pog is better.
[200:42.17]Slug Pog is better.
[200:46.67]But I don't talk about that emote.
[200:50.83]That emote is not supposed to exist anymore.
[200:59.14]Blood everywhere.
[201:04.80]It's late for a lot of you guys.
[201:05.96]I'm surprised there are this many people still here.
[201:08.54]This is late night for a lot of you.
[201:09.96]This is 10, 11, 12, 1.
[201:11.18]This is almost 1.32 a.m.
[201:12.36]for you guys.
[201:13.25]A lot of you Eastern time.
[201:15.61]And don't even talk about EU.
[201:17.97]EU, you just had some fucking tea.
[201:20.19]You woke up.
[201:20.75]You just had some fucking eggs.
[201:23.09]Was it like 7 a.m.
[201:23.63]EU?
[201:23.71]8 a.m.?
[201:23.79]6 a.m.? ?
[201:38.33]I'm losing sleep for this.
[201:40.49]Well, I'm really happy you stopped by.
[201:42.41]Maybe you'll stop by again.
[201:50.11]On the next one.
[201:52.53]Probably tomorrow.
[201:55.31]We'll see you tomorrow.
[201:57.33]What should we do tomorrow?
[201:59.65]You know I'm terrified to go play Hitman 3 again.
[202:02.94]Because of how that stream ended.
[202:05.22]I was literally walking around in a circle for 25 minutes.
[202:07.77]And I was just zonked out of my mind.
[202:10.31]I'm actually terrified to open that game again on stream.
[202:13.31]Because I feel like it's going to happen again.
[202:14.59]I don't know why.
[202:15.15]It's like that level.
[202:16.55]It's just fucking with my head.
[202:18.53]Oh, hey, Wiggly Joe.
[202:24.37]Thanks for 20 community subs.
[202:29.31]Thank you, Wiggly Joe.
[202:29.97]That's a lot of fucking money.
[202:30.89]Thanks for the subs.
[202:34.26]You can skip it.
[202:35.84]I know, but can you really?
[202:37.30]There's only six levels in Hitman.
[202:39.07]You're really going to skip one of them?
[202:40.21]That's skipping, what, 15% of all the content in the whole game?
[202:43.57]15, 30, 45, 60, 75, 100.
[202:44.91]Got it.
[202:45.05]I got it.
[202:45.29]I could just skip it, but...
[203:03.63]I got 400 bucks for that painting that I just put up for 400.
[203:09.66]Should I go back to Hitman 3 tomorrow and do a couple more levels or something?
[203:13.00]What should we do tomorrow?
[203:17.54]It is available.
[203:18.32]It is there.
[203:20.61]Alright, alright.
[203:21.15]We'll do that tomorrow.
[203:22.55]I'm gonna try to not be like a fucking weirdo tomorrow.
[203:36.05]Don't be high.

[245:59.30]Right here.
[245:59.54]I need to finish the background though.
[246:01.89]Maybe just a layer of froth.
[246:05.15]Layer of grass down here.
[246:09.27]Green down here.
[246:10.55]Blend in some green.
[246:38.29]No, rocks, rocks, rocks, rocks.
[246:40.63]More of this cobalt.
[246:42.71]Yeah, more cobalt blue.
[246:45.13]And then I'm going to spray it down here.
[246:46.76]I'm going to do some more froth.
[246:47.68]I need something to spread.
[246:50.92]Where's that?
[246:51.56]Where is it?
[246:51.96]Where's the broom?
[246:54.64]The broom would be perfect right now.
[247:02.80]Where's the broom?
[247:05.10]That little broom handle.
[247:08.36]No, not the mop.
[247:08.96]The broom.
[247:14.28]Where's the broom?
[247:15.96]It's up here.
[247:16.76]Whatever.
[247:17.24]Where's the broom?
[247:23.31]The broom!
[247:24.31]Where's the broom?
[247:25.17]Sorry.
[247:27.73]Under the elevator?
[247:31.91]What is it?
[247:32.23]Where's the broom?
[247:37.32]A broom.
[247:37.93]Where's the broom?
[247:43.11]Oh, wait a minute.
[247:43.53]What about this brush?
[247:47.01]Oh, that might work.
[247:47.82]Hold on.
[247:52.92]Yes, it will.
[247:53.78]Yes, it will.
[247:54.74]Yes, it will.
[247:56.12]Yes, it will.
[249:06.99]This is the thing I should have used for the Bob Ross painting.
[249:10.17]This can spread around like crazy.
[249:26.44]I need more blue here.
[249:29.00]This is like the little bear cave.
[249:32.78]Like his little domain right here.
[250:07.25]This isn't the bear, relax.
[250:12.98]This is a fucking crag that he lives in.
[250:56.24]Dude, this motherfucker's gonna be lying on this rock.
[251:00.22]Just letting the water hit him in the face.
[251:02.06]As he's sitting under the waterfall.
[251:24.38]Look at that crag.
[251:59.12]No, no, no, no.
[252:00.04]The waterfall is behind him.
[252:02.50]Why am I talking like this?
[252:03.58]The waterfall is behind him.
[252:06.16]The waterfall is behind him.
[252:07.82]He is sitting in front of the waterfall.
[252:49.50]They're saying shush.
[252:53.28]Oh, there's still no bears.
[252:54.30]Because I'm almost done with the background.
[252:55.96]Now I'm going to put a bear right here.
[252:57.48]This is the hard part.
[253:04.12]I need to put some blue froth over here or something.
[253:05.84]Because this doesn't look right.
[253:09.60]Yeah, we need some blue.
[253:10.28]I need some froth.
[253:10.86]What color is this?
[253:15.76]Yeah, I got to fill this in.
[253:28.56]holy shit that looks fucking good holy shit looks fucking good
[254:12.69]Look at that shading!
[255:01.33]Now I have to put a bear in front of this.
[255:02.57]I thought he said garbage in all capitals.
[255:12.55]You don't see, like, the difference, the shading in the... Alright.
[255:17.76]Alright, don't overfroth it.
[255:24.39]No, what are you talking about?
[255:26.13]Froth Andy coming in here.
[256:16.72]I need a bear.
[256:21.45]I think I need... Sorry, guys.
[256:23.59]I got to do... Hold on.
[256:28.11]That's got to be deeper up there.
[256:29.22]That's got to be a little bit higher.
[256:30.44]Like this.
[256:31.10]I got to trust it.
[256:42.19]I got to trust it.
[256:48.52]So I'm glad I trusted my intuition here.
[256:54.82]Get up there!
[256:55.42]Oops, all frost.
[257:33.61]it needed some extra texture up here now I think it's perfect
[257:52.14]Now it is.
[257:52.90]Nope.
[257:53.60]Now it is.
[257:53.92]There's a bear in front of this.
[258:05.28]I don't know how to draw a bear.
[258:11.97]You know what?
[258:12.83]Just, you know, before this whole thing is fucking ruined.
[258:25.76]I don't know how to draw a bear.
[258:31.94]OK, we need brown.
[258:37.25]First of all.
[258:40.03]Let's clean this up a little.
[258:47.74]Like a brown like a grizzly bear.
[258:54.36]Don't do that.
[258:58.36]Not brown?
[258:59.00]I know it's not brown.
[258:59.58]We're going to make brown.
[259:00.86]I want it to... This is... Watch.
[259:02.26]Just wait.
[259:18.77]What's that?
[259:20.97]I test it.
[259:31.34]It needs to be a little darker.
[259:32.28]I need a reference.
[259:39.97]Google a bear first.
[259:41.79]Don't you think I should do it from memory?
[259:44.59]I know what a bear looks like.
[259:49.76]Darker.
[259:50.26]Even darker than that.
[259:57.50]That should be good.
[260:05.73]There it is.
[260:06.11]Alright.
[260:06.47]So we got our brown.
[260:07.23]What does a bear look like?
[260:09.45]Let's... Okay.
[260:09.93]Let me get an image of a bear.
[260:12.71]Grizzly bear.
[260:18.65]Grizzly bear.
[260:19.23]Okay.
[260:22.79]Okay.
[260:36.63]So this is what we're looking for.
[260:37.57]Okay.
[260:48.98]And the music back on.
[260:52.17]I just turned it off accidentally.
[260:57.49]Where did the music go?
[261:00.31]Howling Fjord.
[261:02.25]Let's stay on Northrend.
[261:03.41]Why not?
[261:15.28]Okay.
[261:16.97]Bear.
[261:17.21]What we thinking?
[262:53.09]Looks like a fucking gorilla.
[262:54.21]Should it be a gorilla instead?
[262:57.57]A gorilla doing push-ups?
[263:23.35]stay the course alright no no that's alright it's not that bad you made a table make them chunky I I know I know I'm gonna I'm gonna fluff it up a little with some fluff I had to get the outline and then ears okay ears hold on alright I gotta get the outline
[264:08.69]Okay, now I need another tool.
[264:43.54]This motherfucker's 2D?
[264:44.78]What do you mean 2D?
[264:56.28]I'm just trying to get the shape.
[265:13.51]You made Donkey Kong?
[265:21.80]I'm going in with the... I'm going to go and do detailed line work.
[265:29.16]I need his shape first, like his silhouette.
[265:46.69]Black, black, black, black, black, black, black, black.
[266:25.44]It's an interesting technique.

[267:07.46]What?
[267:16.74]He's already bigger and he's already strong.
[267:37.00]Bear, what?
[268:08.68]That's definitely top five gamer moments of 2021.
[268:11.71]Absolutely top five.
[268:12.61]Do you see how fucking well that was?
[268:13.89]Look, get in close.
[268:15.45]Get in close.
[268:15.87]Alright, let's keep going.
[268:47.66]It's alright.
[268:48.02]We can fix it.
[268:48.76]We can fix it later.
[268:54.88]I can fix that.
[268:55.52]I can fix all this.
[269:03.22]Why is that a different color?
[269:03.95]Why is that a different color?
[269:16.57]Oh, it's a different brush.
[269:31.49]Oh, it's wet, you fool.
[269:32.81]Wet?
[269:55.70]It doesn't look that bad.
[269:57.85]I'm gonna pat myself on the face here.
[269:59.99]Doesn't look that bad.
[270:04.01]Could be way worse and you all know it.
[270:13.02]Uh... What the fuck was that?
[270:15.34]I hit like...
[270:25.55]I don't know what happened there.
[270:34.09]Why did that even happen?
[270:40.04]Control Z pretending I like I know.
[270:43.78]But I know I wasn't, but I know what you mean.
[270:46.20]This is stupid, like why that happened?

[273:52.75]Liar.
[273:57.07]It's a felony in Las Vegas.
[273:58.45]No, it is not.
[273:59.89]One billion for zonked.

[274:36.05]No, I was not.
[274:38.44]I was literally just stone cold sober that entire time.
[274:44.04]Alright, let me... I need black.
[274:53.15]Is it two or three?
[274:53.87]I think it was three.
[274:59.81]What do we got so far?
[275:01.31]You smoke it?
[275:01.93]I do not smoke.
[275:03.84]I have a little that I use.
[275:06.66]I usually do between like two and five milligrams of THC and CBD.
[275:12.43]I don't smoke.
[275:13.67]It's easier to control if I eat it.
[275:17.25]And I started really doing it for pain.
[275:18.99]So I still kind of do.
[275:23.05]Weed injection.
[275:25.09]Is this the right color?
[275:25.83]I hope it is.
[275:27.37]It's not.
[275:29.65]Is it?
[275:29.85]Is this wet or is this wrong?
[275:33.85]Wet or wrong?
[275:35.37]Looks kind of wrong.
[275:43.02]Lighten it up.
[275:44.64]Wait.
[275:45.42]Yeah, I need to light it up.
[275:53.01]That looks wrong too.
[275:55.31]Just give me... Where's this stupid thing?
[275:56.55]Give me this thing.
[276:08.75]We got a deal.
[276:09.57]What the fuck?
[276:12.73]Um... That much of you have voted yes for that?
[276:21.30]That's very surprising.
[276:22.34]Okay.
[276:22.98]Um... I... That's a billion.
[276:30.04]That's one billion off the debt.
[276:42.59]We'll see.
[276:47.56]We'll see.
[276:58.80]I might just do it for fun.
[277:00.95]And not have anything to do with that.
[277:15.91]But you know, if a billion comes off, base camp has to be on.
[277:20.70]That was not part of the deal.
[277:22.76]No, you can't do that.
[277:24.16]You can't add stuff like that.
[277:27.45]You can't add stuff like that.
[277:29.11]That's not how it works.
[277:33.51]That's altering.
[277:34.05]That's deal altering.
[277:35.02]No, that's illegal.
[277:35.62]Deal altering.
[277:43.49]That's in the fine print.
[277:45.13]No, it wasn't.
[277:45.71]It's deal altering.
[277:56.51]Deal is off.
[277:57.11]What?
[278:05.66]Deal is off.
[278:06.24]Deal is off.
[278:06.64]Why would the deal be off?
[278:07.48]Because I don't want to do face cam.
[278:08.56]Why is blue coming through this, by the way?
[278:12.26]Is that not dry?
[278:43.32]Alright, what does the bear's face look like?
[278:48.15]Why does he look so weird?
[278:51.17]1.5 with face cam on.
[278:52.21]2 billion for face cam.
[279:41.40]He's got a pink mouth.
[279:52.68]I can fix it with some froth later.
[279:53.87]Don't worry.
[280:07.91]What did you do?
[280:08.53]I'm hold on.
[280:09.29]I'm not done.
[280:12.05]I didn't lean back and go, done.
[280:14.39]No, I'm busy.
[280:15.40]I'm doing it.
[281:06.33]Does his nose need to be bigger?
[281:11.05]No, that's a good size.
[281:19.10]Nostrils, we need gray like circles.
[281:36.11]Okay, let's do the nostrils.
[282:20.04]delete the mouth no I have to I have to make the teeth he's got like a row of teeth here white oh no no not not arctic white we need we don't need arctic white we need shaving cream on your face look at how gray and yellow your teeth look by comparison white

[283:11.82]He's kind of going like... He's going...
[284:33.82]I don't know how to draw eyes and shit.
[284:35.15]I don't know how to do it.
[284:35.83]I don't know how to do this.
[285:01.97]And then I had to fix this and I gotta give him fur.
[285:09.22]This bear is fucking zonked.
[285:39.75]It kind of looks like he's like shit over here.
[285:47.23]Oh, it's fine.
[285:47.67]Alright.
[285:48.85]Now he needs fur.
[286:12.15]I'm not doing anything.
[286:20.09]How do we do texture?
[286:20.93]How do we do fur?
[286:21.65]Oh, it's the same color.
[286:24.57]Shit, you're right.
[286:25.06]Okay, hold on.
[287:06.23]It's like dentures.
[287:11.42]Hey, it's... I think it looks okay.
[287:21.79]Now we got to get some froth going over his back because he's like way... He's bathing.
[288:05.44]Froth him out of existence.
