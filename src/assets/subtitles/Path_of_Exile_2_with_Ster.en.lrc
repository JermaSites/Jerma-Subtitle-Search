[01:08.15]One of our good friends.
[01:09.93]One of our good friends on the channel.
[01:11.67]Of course we're talking about Ster.
[01:19.19]Ster.
[01:20.23]I've played PoE 2.
[01:21.49]I have some time in it.

[04:27.55]Wait, I know what's going on.
[04:28.39]Hold on.
[04:30.41]We haven't even started yet.
[04:32.41]The starting screen is just on.
[04:33.85]Don't worry.
[04:40.55]Okay, what if you start talking... Hold on.
[04:42.43]Wait.
[04:44.62]Why would this be happening?
[04:45.64]You've been coming through perfectly fine.
[04:56.98]Oh shit.
[04:58.16]Ster fucked it all up.
[05:03.46]Hold on.
[05:05.26]Talk again?
[05:09.85]Bro, what the hell's going on?
[05:13.49]What?
[05:17.61]I don't understand.
[05:18.75]This thing was ready to go.
[05:26.63]Because I have you coming through this channel.
[05:28.33]Hey, we haven't even started yet.
[05:30.03]Don't even worry.
[05:35.38]Alright.
[05:37.16]How are you coming through here then?
[05:41.44]Alright.
[05:41.72]I got to change something.
[05:46.88]I can't believe you guys actually can't hear him.
[05:50.08]Do I talk again?
[05:52.31]Oh.
[05:53.65]OK, they can definitely hear you, but you're not supposed to be coming through this.
[06:01.58]OK, yeah, I think I heard myself on stream.
[06:04.34]Yeah, you definitely did.
[06:05.26]Let me do one more thing.
[06:11.79]So if I pump you through here now.
[06:16.09]OK, talk again.
[06:29.01]This doesn't make any fucking sense, but it's all good.
[06:33.69]It really doesn't.
[06:34.51]I don't understand what's going on.
[06:40.59]You were just coming through perfectly fine.
[06:43.06]I gotta get a whole new system.
[06:44.06]Alright, here's what we're going to do.
[06:48.55]How?
[06:48.83]Why would I be able to hear you through here though and not be able to pump it through this?
[06:53.21]Let me do this.
[06:56.53]Talk again, please.
[06:57.85]Yes, yes, hello everyone.
[07:03.27]Can I talk a few more times?
[07:04.83]I could hear that on stream.
[07:05.79]I heard it.
[07:06.31]I'm checking.
[07:07.13]OK, we can definitely hear you perfectly fine now.
[07:10.63]OK.
[07:12.19]Don't ask me what the hell this was about, but whatever.
[07:15.69]I'm curious, but I guess I won't ask.
[07:18.17]Let me turn this down.
[07:22.19]That was very, very weird.
[07:23.39]Okay.
[07:23.95]Alright.
[07:31.41]Hey, everybody.
[07:32.03]Welcome to Path of Exile 2, Dawn of the Hunt.
[07:37.13]I'm seeing some Ster is very quiet.
[07:39.09]Is that true?
[07:40.41]I'm turning you up.
[07:44.56]I set this all up right fucking beforehand, dude.
[07:46.72]It was perfectly... We really did.
[07:47.68]We really did.
[07:48.92]We really did.
[07:49.56]The technology... You know, it's a sponsored stream.
[07:51.52]I ain't gonna fucking freak out.
[07:53.25]Hey, everybody.
[07:53.81]Welcome to the stream.
[07:55.47]The first thing I said to Jerma when he called me was, am I too loud?
[07:59.39]I just changed my audio.
[08:01.87]And then he adjusted it.
[08:04.42]Dude, there is a curse on some streams, I swear.
[08:06.88]Alright, can you hear him?
[08:08.66]We sound good?
[08:14.27]man I love this Ster guy Ster's great yeah one of the goats alright so uh are you I see that your name is information booth good now yes I'm not gonna crash out I'm not gonna crash out on a sponsor stream alright you might but I'm very upset right now
[08:36.26]Anyways, you ready to go?
[08:38.16]Did you kill the little tutorial?
[08:40.23]Yeah, I'm waiting outside of the first town.
[08:42.81]So you take your time.
[08:44.51]You wouldn't want to die to the bloated miller.
[08:47.19]I'm not going to do that.
[08:48.97]I fought the bloated boss before.
[08:52.40]This is the new class, the huntress, right?
[08:58.16]Yes.
[08:58.82]Alright, so... Spears...
[09:05.74]spears in the game before or is it a spear is now a new thing no okay spears are brand new so they have uh all new skills for spears because every weapon has their own skills uh bucklers have their own new parry system if you beat the bloated miller without dying you're better than Elon Musk let me see this I don't want right bumper as an attack
[09:30.97]I think it's fine, actually.
[09:31.67]It's like kind of like... That's good.
[09:33.25]Alright, search for the miller and find safety in Clearfell.
[09:38.12]Those of you that have played Path of Exile 2, this is the... You know, this is the part where you just kind of get familiar with your buttons.
[09:47.52]Somebody said this is gonna be epic.
[09:50.29]well yeah this is the first time we've ever streamed this game together and uh I'm very excited I was saying before when I was muted path of exile one is my favorite game of all time top of the list easy no questions I've been trying to get Jerma to play it with me for uh a Malenia since he was dust in a tomb in Egypt and he has denied me at every opportunity
[10:19.10]But no, you did play PoE 2 for a bit on launch.
[10:24.12]PoE 1 versus PoE 2.
[10:26.50]I remember you were selling me on PoE 2 very early on because you said, hey, it's going to be a little bit slower.
[10:32.25]It's going to be a little more deliberate.
[10:35.19]But I want to look at this just real quick.
[10:37.73]Those of you that don't know PoE, this is going to overwhelm you, but it's... I always looked at this screen and I said, I don't know about this.
[10:49.83]I remember you telling me you thought every single node was an active skill.
[10:53.68]I did.
[10:54.44]I thought these were all spells in the game.
[10:56.54]And I laughed for an hour.
[10:59.10]It hurt.
[11:02.62]No, but seriously, I was like, how the fuck is there like 6,000 spells in the game?
[11:07.71]Is it like Fireball 1, Fireball 2, Fireball 4?
[11:10.85]I really had no idea.
[11:14.45]Yeah, I sponsored Jerma.
[11:16.01]I couldn't help it.
[11:17.85]I really needed to play with him.
[11:20.88]I've actually not done co-op at all in this game either, so I'm excited to try it.
[11:24.84]Yeah, even back when, back when I was playing it at launch, you, we didn't even play together.
[11:31.61]Yeah, true.
[11:34.45]Alright, where is this, where's this guy?
[11:40.26]Whirling Slash!
[11:42.84]Uh, apparently, so let me, let me see if I get this right.
[11:45.68]There are 20 new spear abilities in the game now, right?
[11:50.24]yes very cool uh whirling slash I see yeah and I by the way I'm using a controller I know everyone's gonna freak out and start laughing at me but that's fine they they made a lot of effort in this game to make sure controller works really good in it so it works alright where's whirling slash
[12:19.18]Oh, I have to put it in.
[12:20.88]Yeah.
[12:25.90]What is it?
[12:26.46]Circular slash that kicks up a whirlwind around you, slowing enemies and blinding them in its area effect, leaving the area collapsed.
[12:30.92]Okay, cool.
[12:35.15]There it is.
[12:37.99]Check it out.
[12:39.81]Alright, seems pretty basic to use.
[12:43.29]So while you're here on the beach with all the zombies, the important thing is you need a button for blocking.
[12:49.45]So you, like, raise your shield.
[12:51.11]Oh, okay.
[12:51.87]It's bound already.
[12:52.79]So block a zombie.
[12:55.07]Whenever you block, active block a zombie, it'll, like, automatically parry them.
[13:00.45]Really?
[13:00.83]They'll get, like, a red circle on their body, and then they take more damage.
[13:04.57]Now, Sterk, can I ask you just a quick question?
[13:06.79]Yeah.
[13:06.99]Is that part of this new update, Dawn of the Hunt?
[13:09.81]That is a part of the new update with the new Amazon and Huntress and Ritualist class.
[13:16.81]Oh, it is.
[13:19.70]You're going to need that later.
[13:22.51]Huntress is more complicated, I'd say, than the other.
[13:24.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[13:26.79]You have a stun meter.
[13:29.45]You see the red bar in the middle of the screen, like above your skills?
[13:33.79]Ooh.
[13:34.48]You can't block forever, but if you parry one attack, it's going to be very important.
[13:39.06]That was a TV commercial question.
[13:44.26]I don't know what it is with you of feeling like you need to be a TV commercial.
[13:48.40]I can't fucking help it.
[13:49.76]I can't help it.
[13:50.68]I'm sorry.
[13:51.22]Alright, I'm gonna beat the boss first, right?
[13:54.90]Is this one of those new things in this brand new game?
[14:00.54]I've never... I have... I love this game.
[14:03.56]I know everything about this game.
[14:04.92]I have never seen anyone level up before fighting the miller.
[14:08.30]What?
[14:08.66]What are you talking about?
[14:10.89]I didn't even know it was possible.
[14:12.11]I'm fucking just walking!
[14:14.37]I'm walking towards- towards Run?
[14:16.13]Sorry, I'm not going fast enough for you.
[14:18.47]I'm trying to showcase the move.
[14:19.37]No, like, I genuinely thought they wouldn't let you level up before fighting.
[14:25.89]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[14:27.57]I can't- Okay, so important- I know how to play!
[14:30.49]I know how to play!
[14:31.13]No, the boss has slams.
[14:32.61]The boss, like, slams the ground right and the ground explodes.
[14:35.24]Uh-huh.
[14:35.86]You cannot block those.
[14:37.14]Anything that hits the ground rather than you, you can't block.
[14:40.83]but you need to like if you want to deal actual damage you need to do the parry to this man are you sure about that I'm sure about that find out I'm gonna die alright parry oh shit
[15:09.21]That actually works.
[15:10.35]It's actually crazy.
[15:11.51]There's some bosses that have like, you know, five attack strings and you parry one and the whole thing gets interrupted.
[15:16.57]I was dying.
[15:29.56]I'm going to die to the fucking tutorial boss, dude.
[15:32.51]I'm going to die to the tutorial boss.
[15:33.89]No, no, no, no, it's alright.
[15:47.62]Your default spear stab is actually going to deal more damage than the whirling.
[15:52.16]Oh shit.
[15:53.08]It is?
[15:54.17]Yeah.
[15:56.73]Oh, I got spear throw.
[15:57.61]What the hell am I doing?
[15:58.39]That too.
[16:00.07]Because that's what I want to do.
[16:04.88]I want to do like javelin throws.
[16:16.87]Are you serious?
[16:17.33]People who didn't level up at the beginning of this?
[16:20.88]You could put the skill point in right now for more damage.
[16:23.66]I can't.
[16:24.02]I'm fighting a boss.
[16:25.32]It pauses when you open the skill menu.
[16:28.34]I'm doing fine.
[16:29.34]I'm doing alright.
[16:30.14]Everyone, everyone, everyone relax.
[16:40.68]Look, I just had to, I haven't gotten hit in like 10 seconds.
[16:58.63]Boom!
[16:59.95]There it is!
[17:02.23]Ladies and gentlemen, Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt is currently available right now in early access.
[17:09.41]It's currently $30, but will become completely free at complete launch of the game.
[17:16.25]Fun fact.
[17:19.61]Alright, so here's the thing.
[17:20.47]I want to look at this.
[17:23.19]As an expert, this is the new class, this is the Huntress.
[17:28.09]Uh... Throwing is fun.
[17:33.35]Can you do a little bit of throwing there?
[17:35.07]Somebody said, why is my stream 720p?
[17:38.09]It isn't.
[17:42.16]It is.
[17:44.46]It is.
[17:46.52]What?
[17:49.20]What is going on with my fucking system today?
[17:51.35]Alright, this is uh... you said bottom right?
[17:58.98]Yeah.
[18:02.64]I streamed literally two days ago and didn't change a single thing over here.
[18:06.30]And my stream is not in 1080p?
[18:08.40]Why?
[18:08.64]I thought I was dealing with a professional.
[18:18.41]Let me see.
[18:18.83]Hold on.
[18:19.25]What the fuck is going on here?
[18:20.79]Output.
[18:32.77]Alright, everybody hold on.
[18:33.81]Give me one second.
[18:35.27]I think my settings got, like, reverted.
[18:37.65]I don't even know how.
[18:39.99]Did you somehow switch to, like, a different profile on OBS?
[18:43.13]No, I don't think so.
[18:44.33]Alright, everybody, I'll be back in 10 seconds.
[18:46.23]Vinny had a similar problem.
[18:47.31]Twitch is... Wait, what?
[18:49.63]Hold on, give me one... Alright, we're back.
[18:57.10]Yeah, I have no idea what's going on with that.
[19:03.39]That's goofed.
[19:04.57]Yeah, I didn't change anything.
[19:05.55]I literally just assumed that it was just gonna go.
[19:07.45]Alright, well, we're good.
[19:11.19]What's Holly been doing?
[19:14.19]Okay, so... Starting at the bottom right.
[19:20.06]Uh... Should I just go attack damage?
[19:24.70]Yeah, do it up.
[19:27.72]Okay, what are the big skills?
[19:30.27]The ones that you really want, right?
[19:32.51]Yeah, the big one.
[19:33.13]You kind of just pick a big one in the distance and go there.
[19:37.21]For the early game, you can pretty much always take the initial damages and get that first one and then kind of figure it out after that.
[19:44.34]Okay.
[19:46.10]I mean, if I want to be a thrower... I was born to be a thrower.
[19:54.80]Let's take the attack damage.
[19:55.68]Alright, so I'm going to town.
[19:57.62]Are you going to be in here?
[19:58.22]Are we going to actually hang out and play?
[19:59.66]I'm outside of town.
[20:01.29]I'm waiting for our adventure.
[20:04.83]Follow a guide.
[20:05.59]You're not going to figure this out alone.
[20:07.27]I have a guide.
[20:07.93]He's currently in the call right now.
[20:14.31]Yeah, I'm a guy.
[20:19.51]Sorry, Sai.
[20:21.13]also you played this game yeah so you beat like act three what do you mean you don't know what skill point to put in well it's a new class I don't know I don't want to get it wrong friendly's the name yours well I have no fear I'll smash for you what I can oh I remember this okay so I gotta make a skill jam right now if you could channel your violence against this okay
[20:51.20]Alright, so these are all the spear skills and there are 20 of them.
[20:56.58]What's the good one?
[20:57.42]Yeah, you're going to need first skill you should get disengage because that's like the core mechanic to the whole character.
[21:04.83]Okay, jump back as you rupture the Earth.
[21:09.32]They also have videos on every skill.
[21:11.49]Well, what about explosive spear?
[21:13.59]Pearl a single payload spear that pierces through enemies and lodges in terrain where it lands and it explodes?
[21:19.01]If I'm the information booth, are you going to argue?
[21:20.97]Do you want the info or do you want to go off on your own?
[21:25.85]Alright, tell me, tell me, tell me.
[21:29.85]When you parry something and you disengage and hit the enemy, you get a frenzy charge.
[21:35.31]And then things like Explosive Spear consume Frenzy Charges to be stronger.
[21:39.27]So if you want to throw the Explosive Spear, you're still going to need Disengage in the early game.
[21:44.85]Okay.
[21:45.71]So this is Jump Back, and it makes a big rupture on the Earth.
[21:50.64]And you consume the parry debuff on hitting... Okay, so I do the parry, jump back.
[21:57.14]That'll give me a Frenzy Charge.
[21:59.56]and then any spear throw gets empowered even your like a default throwing one will have an explosion after that okay I guess I'll listen to the information booth I will alright I'm gonna move this stuff around dodge roll is fine there I want spear stab at let's change this yeah I'm using controller on my own uh I like controller
[22:30.96]And this game actually is very good with controller.
[22:32.84]I have a lot of fun with it.
[22:37.58]I like to just lay back on the couch and just play.
[22:40.51]And it's so great to... Dude, can I just tell you?
[22:44.11]My prayers were answered when ARPG devs started to do this.
[22:49.83]I've wanted for so long to be able to play ARPGs with a controller.
[22:56.14]Because, like, I don't know.
[22:56.98]Click, click, click, click, click, click.
[22:58.00]I don't love clicking.
[23:00.91]So, but like being able to walk around, they have WASD in this game now too, right?
[23:05.05]Mm-hmm.
[23:05.59]So, I don't know, it just feels a lot better to me to play.
[23:07.89]It's funny, the evolution, because very early Path of Exile 1 days, they were completely opposed to adding it.
[23:13.49]And I remember, like, that was a big reason why I couldn't get you to play.
[23:17.01]Yeah.
[23:17.99]It's true.
[23:19.25]Well.
[23:22.85]Turns out people want to sleep on a couch while they play video games.
[23:25.79]That's true.
[23:26.45]Who knew?
[23:30.34]Is it food mode?
[23:31.24]No, not quite food mode, but more just like kind of chill mode.
[23:36.88]Is he coming back?
[23:38.00]Tell everybody to refresh.
[23:39.06]Refresh, refresh, refresh, refresh.
[23:40.48]We're good.
[23:44.87]I don't know why it like reset.
[23:46.33]It like deleted all of my... I streamed two days ago.
[23:50.43]I didn't do anything.
[23:51.13]Okay, I think this is fine now.
[23:59.56]So what's the first question?
[24:00.96]What did you make?
[24:03.09]Uh, Sorceress.
[24:04.45]Okay.
[24:05.69]Is there anything new for... Um, like... The whole early game is pretty much reworked in a patch that came out yesterday.
[24:16.81]And there's just a ton of new stuff in the game in general.
[24:21.68]I have actually not played any of the casters in early game either.
[24:28.06]Caster was a lot of fun when I played it before.
[24:29.67]I think I'm ready.
[24:35.37]Bone wand.
[24:36.47]Oh, I got a bone blast spell.
[24:38.23]Wait, is this technically spell damage or no?
[24:41.01]Yeah, it is.
[24:42.09]Dude, that's a crazy wand.
[24:44.97]This is crazy, isn't it?
[24:47.05]Yes, this is insane.
[24:50.33]How do I use this?
[24:52.59]You get to level three and have nine intelligence.
[24:56.28]Oh shit, OK.
[24:59.50]But all of your skill points are going to be attack damage, so it might still fall off.
[25:03.28]Oh, yeah, I got all these tabs.
[25:04.44]That's right.
[25:04.90]I got the extra tab things.
[25:07.53]I mean, you also, when you get a skill gem, can just get a spell.
[25:11.17]But then you're not... I don't know if you really wanted the whole spear experience.
[25:15.91]I want to definitely throw.
[25:17.53]Throwing spears seems fun.
[25:18.53]Throwing javelins seems fun.
[25:23.23]So, okay, out of the new... There's apparently 100 new support gems, right?
[25:27.59]Yeah.
[25:28.87]That seems like a lot.
[25:30.98]Do they add anything good?
[25:34.04]A lot of them are kind of weird fringe cases.
[25:37.02]There's a lot of skills that didn't have supports before.
[25:40.50]Some of them are quite good.
[25:41.44]A lot of them are like hunter specific.
[25:46.99]So yeah, no, they're pretty good.
[25:48.39]Okay, so that's disengage.
[25:50.81]So I parry, disengage, then throw.
[25:53.71]Is that what you're saying, right?
[25:55.63]Yes.
[25:57.34]Oh.
[25:58.38]Oh, hey.
[25:59.20]Is that you?
[26:01.74]Greetings, traveler.
[26:03.66]I am the information booth.
[26:06.82]Okay.
[26:07.06]If you have any questions, I will guide you on this quest.
[26:11.27]Okay, first question.
[26:14.29]Where did you get those wings?
[26:16.95]They cost a lot of money, but I think the wings were for watching a Twitch stream, maybe.
[26:24.45]Cool.
[26:24.59]Alright.
[26:28.48]Good luck, mortal.
[26:29.34]Alright, so radio menu.
[26:35.58]Open your radio menu.
[26:36.80]Movie the joystick and select an option.
[26:40.20]Skills.
[26:40.90]Okay, I get it.
[26:41.44]I'm kind of doing a Tyrael thing.
[26:45.45]You do sound like that.
[26:46.13]Alright.
[26:46.43]Alright.
[26:55.30]So we need to... Let's just go kill shit.
[26:57.58]Alright.
[26:57.92]So here we go.
[26:58.66]Walk.
[26:59.42]Boom.
[27:01.22]Okay.
[27:01.40]That was kind of insane.
[27:02.30]Your spear explodes afterwards.
[27:03.76]Alright.
[27:04.10]That was kind of insane.
[27:04.66]Yeah.
[27:05.20]So like once we get you to get an explosive spear, then it has like a special effect when you use the frenzy charge.
[27:09.80]How do I get this off?
[27:21.69]The information booth cannot help you with controller controls.
[27:25.53]Can the information booth please help me with, uh, how do I get this radial menu off the screen?
[27:29.47]That is a controller control.
[27:30.69]I have no idea.
[27:32.76]Controller control.
[27:34.20]Arrow down.
[27:38.72]Controller control.
[27:39.70]Like bind screen?
[27:42.84]Oh, it wants me to actually bind.
[27:44.46]Oh, it wants me to bind down portal.
[27:46.08]I don't know what I'm doing.
[27:53.07]Do what it asks.
[28:00.57]You can't parry spells.
[28:09.28]Great work.
[28:10.36]Thank you.
[28:12.50]So are you going to wait?
[28:14.52]What level are you?
[28:15.12]Are you like level like 50?
[28:17.20]No, I made a new character.
[28:19.46]Oh, why do you look like you're like level 100?
[28:22.52]This way, adventurer.
[28:23.50]Oops.
[28:26.34]You look like you're level like 70.
[28:27.81]Yeah, no, I have nothing equipped.
[28:31.69]I'm I'm I this is all a front.
[28:34.01]Alright, let's do Perry.
[28:41.16]right what about parry and then into uh jump oh let me try this it's only the spear throws get empowered not the man okay um nobody likes melee I think melee's fun me too alright I get it that's a that's a lot
[29:10.38]Yeah, one of my favorite things is throwing anything.
[29:13.56]You can do lightning spear too, can't you?
[29:17.12]Uh, lightning spear is currently like the strongest thing in the game.
[29:21.44]That seems amazing.
[29:22.81]You'll be happy with it.
[29:31.13]Alright, so do you think I'm going to die to the first real boss?
[29:33.75]Be honest.
[29:35.21]Um...
[29:37.29]I think you need to lock in gamer mode and you need to beat it first try okay because there's a there's a whole oh wait wait can't we get like can't npcs attack us in this now uh not until cruel difficulty they don't show up but you get like actually attacked by people they're actually really cool yeah
[30:03.53]so like they drop a full set of gear as though they were a person and they use all the player skills and they talk shit it's like an invasion it's weird I gotta unbind this whenever you're ready enter the mud burrow adventurer you really do sound like you're in the game
[30:33.98]You sound like the guy, the solo developer that made the entire game and is doing the voiceover.
[30:45.17]A foul beast lives within these decrepit caves.
[30:49.21]Some say world rank one Elon Musk died to it on his private jet and then ended his stream.
[30:55.70]You must succeed.
[31:00.94]Oh God.
[31:01.42]Okay, let's go.
[31:06.82]Level up!
[31:08.40]Congrats.
[31:15.39]Your fucking wings are like in the way.
[31:18.97]I hate them.
[31:19.57]I never wear these.
[31:21.37]I never use these cosmetics.
[31:26.37]Am I going to get some encouragement from the information booth, please?
[31:30.66]You're doing very well.
[31:33.56]Great work.
[31:35.51]You appear entrapped.
[31:37.81]Do you need help?
[31:38.79]No, I don't want help.
[31:47.21]My kind used to rule this world.
[31:52.94]Oh, you're you got the level three as well, nice.
[31:56.58]I need you to travel to the Forbidden Plains and fight my brother is wall for two skill points.
[32:11.68]So one of the things I really do like about PoE 2, and this is probably the same way in PoE 1 as well, right?
[32:19.16]The bosses are just cool.
[32:20.28]There's a ton of them and they're just gigantic.
[32:22.42]They have a million different moves.
[32:23.56]They're so, I don't know.
[32:24.44]I love like big, cool bosses.
[32:26.42]There's a lot of them.
[32:28.08]The end game bosses for PoE 1, sure.
[32:30.78]But PoE 2 is a lot better.
[32:41.55]Harry got it.
[32:44.58]He's out here parrying bugs.
[32:52.10]Thank you.
[32:57.51]That's probably easier if I'm helping.
[32:59.57]It probably would be easier if you helped, but you know we're doing a little thing here.
[33:05.79]I gotta put a point in.
[33:07.75]Oh hey.
[33:09.56]Let me see what, wait, I gotta get this right.
[33:12.22]What's down here?
[33:13.70]Life blast game, one charge per second, plus 10 strength.
[33:16.24]That's cool.
[33:16.92]I think I want this.
[33:20.03]Primal Instinct.
[33:24.55]Yep.
[33:26.11]So you're just, if you want projectile damage or whatever.
[33:32.19]It's all good.
[33:34.15]Alright, I'm going to do, let's go this way.
[33:36.43]Some more damage.
[33:39.19]That's 10% more attack damage.
[33:40.25]Alright, cool.
[33:50.98]Ooh!
[33:53.16]Stop!
[33:53.54]I need to pick that up.
[33:57.98]Harry didn't work on that.
[34:00.06]Can you explain why?
[34:00.70]Um... I didn't pay attention, but yeah, anything that slams the ground, you can't block, like I was saying.
[34:10.32]So if they do like a big overhand and it like crushes the ground, you can't block it.
[34:14.52]Cool.
[34:18.52]Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[34:23.28]I want to get whatever the first throwing ability I get.
[34:29.94]Explosive Spear is sick.
[34:34.52]So you're saying explosives, but this is the boss first boss, right?
[34:37.64]Yeah, I'm not helping.
[34:38.78]Don't help.
[34:39.32]Let me let me drink a little bit of my iced coffee.
[34:40.76]I gotta get ready for this because people are gonna make fun of me if I don't do this.
[34:48.36]It does it because I'm in the game.
[34:50.58]I think it has 40% more health.
[34:52.19]That's fine.
[34:55.38]Okay.
[34:56.40]I'm just going to be locking it in as I think about the fact that when this game releases, it'll be free to play and that it's currently $30 right now in early access on pretty much all the major platforms and that Dawn of the Hunt is out and the Huntress is the new class, the one I'm currently playing right now.
[35:11.60]That's what's going to be going through my head.
[35:19.23]good luck good luck adventurer help help help help please it teleported me into the arena can I can I block this um anything that's a projectile you can block but you have to be standing right next to the guy that shot it like like in like right next to him and also that stun meter like bosses can still stun you when you're blocking a little bit oh boom
[36:00.71]Oh Actually, it actually is fun I like it He's gonna get stunned
[36:20.65]And then we can go crazy, right?
[36:26.73]I feel like you're luring me into diving too deep into like E3 press conference commentary.
[36:32.86]No, I'm not.
[36:34.96]He's about to get stunned.
[36:36.24]I would be doing the same shit if we were not on stream.
[36:38.64]You know I would be.
[36:40.32]I know.
[36:45.48]Oh, I was there.
[36:49.67]Alright, is there a place where if I die, it's not like dying?
[36:53.03]I'm gonna die.
[36:53.85]Um, purgatory?
[36:56.31]No, no, I mean like if I die at a certain encounter, it's like, okay, that's fine, dude.
[37:01.33]You're good.
[37:03.57]No, it's never okay.
[37:07.39]Why would it be okay?
[37:16.33]But certainly not this boss.
[37:18.13]I'm gonna need big damage here.
[37:19.27]I'm gonna need big damage!
[37:33.14]I get a heal?
[37:43.75]Do I even have mana?
[37:44.97]Do I even spend any on this character?
[37:47.03]You're not going to notice mana for a while on attack characters now.
[37:54.07]Dude, get in there.
[37:54.95]Need heals.
[37:55.93]Parry it.
[37:58.71]I don't want to die.
[38:00.84]We both get the damage buff if you parry.
[38:07.66]Dude, get in there.
[38:08.58]I'm right next to it.
[38:10.26]Get in.
[38:10.58]Nice!
[38:12.44]Nice!
[38:16.06]What?
[38:17.46]Dude, don't touch anything.
[38:18.70]What the fuck, dude?
[38:19.56]10 gold, 59 gold, 16 gold.
[38:24.52]Crude bow, leather vest.
[38:26.70]Tattered robe, regal shard.
[38:29.70]Nice.
[38:34.89]Do you want any of this?
[38:37.11]Um, no.
[38:39.17]I'll resist.
[38:39.81]I'll take it.
[38:48.00]Into the frog adventurer.
[38:50.79]Hold on, I'm looking at stuff.
[38:52.03]I need more scrolls.
[38:52.73]Are you on console?
[39:01.58]No, I'm using a controller.
[39:12.57]So does, um, did sorcerers, did sorcerers get a, or did they have new ascendancies, right?
[39:19.21]Witch got one, right?
[39:20.66]Uh, witch got a new ascendancy, yeah.
[39:23.52]Lich?
[39:24.42]I wonder if that's any good.
[39:26.38]Um, it's pretty cool.
[39:28.26]Pretty cool.
[39:29.96]It's more of
[39:31.31]I don't know.
[39:31.73]I haven't really dabbled in too much of the witch stuff.
[39:34.81]It looks strong.
[39:35.59]A lot of people are playing it, especially because specters are new, which I've always talked about being one of the coolest things where you can any minion, any monster you kill in the whole game, you can resummon.
[39:45.69]Oh, that's so cool.
[39:46.23]It's a throwback to the old Diablo II Resurrection.
[39:51.13]And it's done really well.
[39:54.00]Like every single monster has a different spirit cost.
[39:57.64]So you can get like one real big guy or a bunch of little dudes.
[40:03.70]I saw in the trailer a couple of huge ones.
[40:08.71]There's like two huge monsters.
[40:10.75]Some pretty ridiculous stuff you can get.
[40:13.90]um also since you last played wait you didn't leave town I'm still here oh well let me know when we're going you take your time honey you want to let chat vote on your build um I feel like that's probably not a great idea because I I want to do explosive spear and this be level two
[40:45.75]Alright, so now... Explosive Spear.
[40:49.91]The Explosive Spear consumes your Frenzy Charge and lights the ground on fire and has like a quicker explosion.
[40:57.92]Okay, that sounds amazing.
[40:58.96]I want this.
[41:01.08]So I should just put this on instead of my regular throw.
[41:07.49]Yes, you can still do both, but is there a reason to do the other one?
[41:15.05]You can only have one flame spear at a time.
[41:16.81]OK, so it still does like all of the basic attacks do really high base damage in the early game.
[41:25.79]Also, let me let me do something real quick here, because I actually I really mean this is I mean and you can you can vouch for this too, by the way, Ster.
[41:33.14]Okay, I'm vouching.
[41:34.60]I saw that there were 100 new uniques in this update.
[41:39.36]Is that accurate?
[41:41.02]Yes.
[41:41.70]Okay.
[41:43.06]Uniques are like the only thing I care about in ARPGs.
[41:45.52]The only thing.
[41:46.82]It's the reason why I play them.
[41:49.22]And the fact that there's a fucking hundred added.
[41:54.02]That's cool.
[41:55.00]I think a lot of new Path of Exile players that are new to PoE 2 haven't experienced like a PoE 2 patch.
[42:02.34]Where they're just like 100 sports, 100 uniques and.
[42:06.98]They they they're very good at, especially since launch, reacting to stuff and made like a full patch notes worth of changes in the last week since launch.
[42:18.26]Cool.
[42:19.74]Oh, where did you wait?
[42:20.30]Hold up, wait, hold up, wait, hold up.
[42:21.58]Where'd you go?
[42:23.42]Right here.
[42:24.90]OK, that way I gotta sell all this crap.
[42:28.51]I got a bunch of junk.
[42:34.02]No, that's fine.
[42:37.16]I hope you get to really know everyone in town.
[42:38.78]Have a nice conversation with Renly while you're in there.
[42:41.30]Ask him how the kids are.
[42:42.42]Why not?
[42:42.86]Hey, Renly.
[42:45.32]I need to buy scrolls.
[42:48.98]Hold on.
[42:51.53]Sell scrolls.
[42:53.45]Wait, are these better?
[42:54.19]Sometimes these are better.
[42:55.03]Yeah, they are, right?
[42:58.85]Lesser flask.
[43:01.47]This one's 58.
[43:02.41]50 life over 3 seconds.
[43:05.47]20% charge gain.
[43:06.29]Okay.
[43:06.81]And then this one.
[43:07.73]Oh, this isn't better.
[43:08.45]Okay.
[43:12.54]Put this one on.
[43:14.36]Cool.
[43:22.68]Also, should I hang on to flask?
[43:23.94]I forget.
[43:24.34]I don't hang on to flask, right?
[43:27.15]Don't really need to in this one.
[43:28.94]um if they're older smaller flasks you just sell them alright something good something good something good that seems kind of insane okay um 32 increase cold damage on a wand you want this yeah I'll use that seems kind of good you cannot drop that oh there's like a bunch of people here oh yeah you can't drop in town oh okay
[44:00.80]I'm not in town either.
[44:10.51]I know, I know.
[44:11.05]I always like take so long to do this.
[44:14.11]I just need to make sure I know what I'm... Wait, wait, this is a support gem.
[44:16.40]Sorry.
[44:16.64]Alright.
[44:19.24]I want to see, show everything.
[44:21.75]So, Spear Throw.
[44:22.67]This is all... Okay.
[44:23.81]So, for those of you that don't know, Ster is going to explain what all this means.
[44:29.45]I'm just kidding.
[44:30.29]I know what this is.
[44:30.93]Alright.
[44:31.83]So, this is a Support Gem.
[44:33.89]And... I want to put it on Explosive Spear.
[44:37.23]So, all these... You have... The skills in the game are gems, right?
[44:41.71]Find them.
[44:42.41]You go through... Oh, Level 1 Skill Gem.
[44:45.39]You activate it.
[44:46.01]You get the skill you want.
[44:47.69]You put it on your bar.
[44:49.00]You then get these things called Support Gems.
[44:52.54]They add cool things to the moves, okay?
[44:57.62]So I have to decide what I want to add to Explosive Spear.
[45:01.30]And it's gonna be fucking crazy.
[45:02.66]The Recommendeds are usually pretty good.
[45:06.56]They usually are, so I'm just gonna go with that.
[45:08.22]Okay.
[45:09.62]Uh, Ignition.
[45:12.51]Uh, yeah, the first one, Fire Infusion, for now.
[45:14.41]100% more chance to move Knight?
[45:17.09]Oh my god!
[45:20.64]What's the other one?
[45:21.60]Overabundance?
[45:23.90]I kind of want this.
[45:24.48]I can have more than one, right?
[45:28.48]I'm going to do this one.
[45:30.32]I think you should see how the skill works first.
[45:34.49]Already did it.
[45:35.95]Okay.
[45:37.89]This means I can have two out at the same time.
[45:40.65]Okay.
[45:40.93]Yeah, no, that's fine.
[45:43.57]Let me see.
[45:44.19]Okay.
[45:50.58]What's up, dude?
[45:55.66]Does he do anything?
[45:57.60]He's just going to come back here.
[46:00.98]You can now teleport between checkpoints when you click them.
[46:04.67]Oh.
[46:06.63]So we want to go here, right?
[46:09.63]Yeah.
[46:11.89]Relwood.
[46:12.73]You want to find this tractor.
[46:14.27]A big tractor came through here.
[46:15.81]A big hauler.
[46:17.59]Sure.
[46:21.10]Laying out all this lumber.
[46:22.50]Alright, I want to check this new skill out.
[46:25.88]Oh, I'm out of flask.
[46:30.30]Hold on.
[46:32.59]Actually, you keep going that way.
[46:33.87]I'm going to check this way.
[46:35.35]We haven't been up here.
[46:36.23]We need to go to the Grelwood.
[46:37.43]Alright, let me try this.
[46:39.97]Oh, no.
[46:40.27]Come to me.
[46:41.37]Come to me.
[46:41.81]Dude!
[46:43.17]Come to me.
[46:44.06]To you?
[46:44.70]Mini boss, dude.
[46:46.18]Oh, right.
[46:46.54]There's a little quest set here.
[46:53.42]Okay, that is crazy actually.
[46:55.06]Hey, we've got the synergy.
[46:57.80]I'm going to put down the firewalls.
[47:03.09]And then the true E3 commentary.
[47:05.51]You throw the spear through the firewalls and it gets fire damage.
[47:08.21]Extra fire damage?
[47:08.69]And then we're the fire dream team.
[47:09.69]Well, isn't that bad?
[47:11.19]Shouldn't you be like lightning or ice or something?
[47:15.38]No.
[47:16.68]I am the information booth.
[47:19.76]Right.
[47:20.02]Sorry.
[47:20.42]I'm sorry.
[47:20.76]I didn't mean to.
[47:21.88]This way.
[47:28.34]Alright.
[47:29.84]Let's do it.
[47:30.40]Yeah, that's a lot of damage.
[47:48.21]We are fucking smoking her.
[47:52.65]You said I wasn't allowed to say anything like that.
[47:57.43]Just kill the boss already, please.
[47:58.73]Oh, so don't smoke her.
[48:03.27]No, we're doing good.
[48:04.76]We're doing real good.
[48:06.02]Okay.
[48:08.62]Massive damage, dude.
[48:10.88]Huge.
[48:11.44]That twig circlet is mine.
[48:13.36]Actually, this first yellow.
[48:18.31]Two quilted vests.
[48:19.19]Do you want the blue one or do you want the yellow one?
[48:21.05]I don't care either way.
[48:23.13]They are dexterity based, so you go ahead.
[48:26.08]Alright, hold on.
[48:26.90]Come on, come on.
[48:29.06]Oh.
[48:30.18]Oh, by the way, here.
[48:34.62]So this just gives you plus 10% cold resist forever, right?
[48:40.31]Yeah.
[48:43.73]That's for doing the quest.
[48:44.55]Cool.
[48:45.85]You did it.
[48:50.53]I want to see one of those NPC invaders.
[48:52.01]I really do.
[48:52.69]You said it's only in Krul.
[48:54.79]yeah have to be like act three before they start showing up I do like them a lot I wish they were earlier I already said yes that's what it says on the item yeah well I'm just I'm just asking alright if if you had an all-knowing god following you around wouldn't you want to double check things with them every once in a while I would now which one exactly whoa whoa whoa whoa what's that
[49:23.05]mine what do you mean whoa that was like bright fucking letters what is that it's just an amulet oh you gave me a a loot filter I thought this was like a unique or something yeah no sorry that one shows up as important because if it has no mods on it you can use a chance orb to turn it into unique and the unique is worth a lot of money and it's the whole thing okay guys Ster has like 500 000 hours in this franchise so he gave me a loot filter that is supposed to help me
[49:57.55]It's a whole thing.
[49:58.19]You wouldn't get it.
[49:59.52]Nice.
[50:03.34]We have to go through here.
[50:04.00]Yep.
[50:07.76]Did I get any new gems or anything?
[50:10.08]You got a skill point.
[50:12.48]Ooh.
[50:12.94]Let's see.
[50:26.41]um getting close to this this one is what I want oh area effect that's good Carl will also be joining us now what does it go from here you've gained an ally they are however both drunks
[50:53.96]I kind of think this is probably worth it.
[50:55.90]Alright, I'll go.
[50:56.56]8% attack damage.
[51:00.91]Okay, the you've gained an ally, that was pretty good.
[51:03.11]That sounded exactly the way it was supposed to go.
[51:06.01]Good.
[51:06.47]Wait, he's not following me.
[51:08.41]Okay, he was lazy.
[51:09.65]Oh, this is the new mechanic in Dawn of the Hunt.
[51:12.62]Yeah, this is spirits, right?
[51:14.12]Track the spirit.
[51:14.82]Yeah.
[51:22.06]Okay, search the grill for evidence of the Count's activities.
[51:24.46]That's a different quest.
[51:25.42]Oh, spirit, spirit, spirit.
[51:26.34]You activated it, yep.
[51:28.10]You gotta follow the spirit and it goes to a rare monster and juices him.
[51:32.45]So it turns a rare monster into a super rare monster, right?
[51:36.31]Yep.
[51:39.01]What happens if we lose sight of it?
[51:40.07]Is that bad?
[51:41.93]It waits for you a little bit, but it will disappear.
[51:50.03]and I'm really curious that I haven't seen they made a lot of changes to the early acts where the monsters are going to be a little bit like less infinitely aggressive like this zone I think even the werewolves are a little slower oh okay this guy's been juiced up oh my god
[52:29.54]I thought that was in the game and I just got scared try picking on someone your own size I'd be a good NPC you would be a pretty good NPC honestly okay cool
[52:49.03]Oh, sorry, I picked up the loot here.
[52:51.58]You need this?
[52:52.96]Oh, I would actually love it.
[52:54.74]Okay, follow the wisps in there, yeah.
[53:00.62]Cool, alright.
[53:02.46]So that can just happen randomly, right?
[53:04.21]Yeah.
[53:07.91]That first one is the tutorial, and then it just shows up.
[53:10.87]Cool.
[53:15.07]What about Twister?
[53:15.85]What is this?
[53:19.29]uh you're probably not going to want to use twister because it combos with the whirling slash and it would take too long to set all of that up so disengage is probably the one I want right now because that 93 what made level two in it uh you know you could give it to me I could freaking use one you do you want it could you actually use it yeah okay fine
[53:47.72]So these are the orbs that you just roll random shit on items, right?
[53:51.88]Uh, yeah.
[53:52.38]And you are meant to be using them early.
[53:54.16]So, like, if you get a spear, or you could even add your spear right now.
[54:01.94]I feel like I gotta wait until I get a good one, right?
[54:03.96]Or should I just make this normal one a magic item?
[54:06.64]You should be getting a lot of these.
[54:07.94]So it shouldn't be too big of a deal to just do it now.
[54:10.56]Okay.
[54:10.96]I just gave it two to three fire damage.
[54:12.40]That's pretty cool.
[54:13.70]Wait, now... Oh, now I can just...
[54:17.47]This item is unusable?
[54:18.51]Oh, whoops.
[54:22.89]And then I just add it to the spear?
[54:24.97]Yeah, the two-faced one adds the second mod because it has two faces.
[54:30.32]Oh, that's cool.
[54:30.82]Okay, so 7% attack speed.
[54:35.46]So you should be just dumping these early, right?
[54:38.12]Like you said.
[54:40.18]Not necessarily dumping, but having a good weapon's good.
[54:43.62]Filling out stuff that you're missing.
[54:44.90]So like if a normal ring dropped like if if you didn't use those I'd probably use them on the amulet that dropped.
[54:49.74]It's a lot of attack speed Seven percent Yeah, okay cool, let's go dude, let's freaking do wolves If you uh, you hit the the explosive spear combo
[55:09.75]yeah you see it sick you see what it did I did I did yeah bosses ain't gonna have nothing on us big wolves yeah big there's this huge dogs in this game my first character I was using the new like specter where you can get any monster I was trying to get the biggest dog in path of exile too
[55:37.88]There is one massive dog that covers like half your screen.
[55:45.07]So is the count the one in the beginning that's like, Exiled.
[55:48.63]You have the crime of being inside of the...
[55:54.06]the area without you me knowing that is roughly what he that's that's pretty close I was searching I was searching for something to say I was I'm telling that's the most desperate I've ever been to search for something yeah the boss of the act one definitely does say you shouldn't be here and then fights you
[56:21.82]You're right.
[56:23.32]Dude, you just fucking faceplanted.
[56:26.46]Yeah, I did.
[56:27.28]That was an absolute faceplant.
[56:30.94]He says a bad word.
[56:32.30]You failed the QTE?
[56:33.70]That's what it felt like, yeah.
[56:47.45]Why am I stuttering right now?
[56:52.09]um there's a chance that path of exile does this thing where like the first time you enter area yeah so I think I saw that when you first entered town that it should go away so I can parry spells like is it poison parable technically um if you stand close enough you have to be within one meter okay when it shoots the projectile then yeah can I have this uh support gym yeah
[57:21.25]You should change to Vulcan if you're not on it.
[57:23.91]You should not.
[57:24.37]I'm shot.
[57:26.41]You should listen to the information booth.
[57:28.12]Okay.
[57:38.47]Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[57:50.28]I wonder if I can do more than one of those in a row.
[57:51.90]Because I can throw two of them out, but I don't think the second one does the big super bomb.
[57:57.66]Yeah, the limit of two is just that the first one you throw has the timer.
[58:02.08]You're going to have two waiting to explode.
[58:06.00]Yeah, but if you throw the third one, the first one's going to disappear.
[58:18.27]The two guys following me look like enemies.
[58:20.23]Like I'm trying to fight them.
[58:21.17]They do.
[58:21.63]I really think they're enemies.
[58:24.15]They want my information.
[58:29.57]But I will not give it to them until they pay me back for that loan.
[58:33.96]There is a unique buckler that lets you parry projectiles.
[58:37.06]Yeah, this one.
[58:38.56]Oh, I thought it dropped.
[58:39.84]Stop doing that to me.
[58:40.70]I just had it in my inventory.
[58:43.00]I was like, holy shit, that's the luckiest thing ever.
[58:45.04]I was like, how the fuck did that happen?
[58:46.82]I should
[58:50.11]We just got the luckiest thing ever.
[58:52.15]Oh, whoa.
[58:52.57]Did you think we were just talking about it?
[58:56.57]Let me read this.
[58:58.50]Alright.
[58:58.78]71 mana.
[59:01.18]15% all resistances.
[59:02.84]Accuracy.
[59:04.02]Parried enemies take more spell damage instead of more attack damage.
[59:08.18]Cool.
[59:15.03]I love uniques.
[59:18.96]That's why I got that unique tab thing, because I... I think I told you eventually I wanted to collect every single one in the game, and then I stopped playing.
[59:25.56]Then one day... one day... it'll hook you.
[59:32.14]I mean, it definitely did.
[59:32.86]When you least expect it.
[59:35.18]I... I liked it a lot.
[59:48.81]charm explain these to me because I was confused with these before um you can't equip them yet there's a quest that like later gives you your first charm slot or you need a belt to put it on so it's just uh they buff them a lot actually now yeah uh so like if you take fire damage it just gives you fire resistance for the time that it says it's kind of like um automatically reacts to things that happen so there's ones that prevent you from being frozen and then it reduces the charges on it
[60:19.61]Which also it'll show you how many charges it has now if that was helping you not be confused.
[60:26.93]When it's equipped.
[60:28.61]Oh cool, OK.
[60:30.76]Let me do a support gym here.
[60:31.94]I think I'm going to make my explosive spear crazy.
[60:36.88]25% extra fire damage on it and OK, so this says it deals less cold and lightning damage.
[60:45.73]It doesn't matter, right?
[60:47.55]Not unless you deal colder lightning damage.
[60:50.42]Okay, so the explosive spear now is disgusting.
[60:53.26]Got it.
[60:58.96]And yeah, if you're throwing it through the firewall, it gets bonus fire damage.
[61:04.22]Cool.
[61:20.66]Watch out, we got, um... We got blue names.
[61:40.02]Shit, I missed.
[61:42.12]Shit, he missed!
[61:43.96]Okay, so when they miss me, it freaks me out because I'm trying to parry, and if they miss, I don't get to parry.
[61:50.61]Wait, spear.
[61:51.15]Is this better than what I have?
[61:55.95]Cool.
[61:56.79]Five to nine.
[61:58.50]No.
[61:59.36]Nah.
[62:00.62]Nah.
[62:02.12]Yeah, nah.
[62:04.18]Eh.
[62:05.06]Eh.
[62:05.36]Would you... Adventurer, would you kindly touch my obelisk?
[62:10.74]Yes.
[62:11.98]I can't.
[62:12.82]I have to wait until there's no enemies around so I can touch it.
[62:16.15]I've touched it.
[62:27.35]shit wrong way rune of power
[62:56.04]Alright, are we doing a shitload of damage?
[62:58.13]Because I feel like we're killing things.
[63:00.81]This thing is crazy.
[63:04.55]It's so much damage.
[63:05.83]Generally in co-op we should be pretty strong too, but we'll see.
[63:08.54]There's a wall coming up here, right?
[63:11.48]Isn't there like a pretty significant wall?
[63:14.54]Like DPS wall?
[63:17.36]I mean, not necessarily.
[63:24.43]So because there's so many things that interact with each other, co-op is a little bit easier with two people.
[63:28.85]Like me saying, you throwing spears through the firewall gives you bonus damage.
[63:34.38]And then me casting lightning shocks them, which gives you extra damage.
[63:39.02]And bosses only get 40% more health rather than like double, I think.
[63:42.70]Cool.
[63:56.43]Hold on.
[63:58.21]Ster's character looks OP.
[64:02.55]I assure you, Ster has the same gear on that I do.
[64:05.74]Hold on, hold on.
[64:06.54]Let me... After this, let me do my transform.
[64:25.79]Are you exploding things?
[64:27.97]Yeah.
[64:29.47]We're both exploding characters.
[64:38.83]Adventurer.
[64:39.39]Let's see.
[64:42.91]You wouldn't like me how I'm disgusting.
[64:45.94]Don't look.
[64:49.90]How do I zoom in?
[64:55.47]I don't know what that is on controller.
[64:58.90]Oh, I have no idea.
[65:00.82]Yeah, that's what he actually looks like.
[65:02.50]That's what the facade is gone.
[65:04.50]That's what he really looks like.
[65:12.83]I flunked information school.
[65:14.95]Don't tell my parents.
[65:17.00]I didn't really pass.
[65:18.66]I just put on the big wings so people think what I say is true.
[65:21.57]I don't know what I'm talking about.
[65:23.31]It's alright.
[65:24.21]It's okay.
[65:25.50]As long as we now know the truth, it's fine.
[65:40.24]Okay, it's boss time.
[65:41.66]Boss time?
[65:42.10]I'm going to sit this one out.
[65:44.52]Alright.
[65:45.46]Place your bets.
[65:45.92]Are we going to make it through this?
[65:46.94]Wait.
[65:47.50]I got my cool passive.
[65:49.80]Alright.
[65:50.84]8% attack speed, 8% area of effect, and 10 dexterity.
[65:55.27]We got a long way to go.
[65:57.57]Cool.
[65:57.87]Okay.
[66:00.99]So area effect, that includes this thing, right?
[66:04.17]Okay.
[66:07.29]Cool.
[66:07.75]Yep.
[66:07.85]Alright.
[66:08.71]I'm ready.
[66:10.01]Take this.
[66:11.03]Sure.
[66:14.54]What do I want to do with this?
[66:15.42]Just get something?
[66:17.78]Whatever you want.
[66:18.46]I'm going to do disengage level two.
[66:20.52]Ooh.
[66:24.26]What are these?
[66:27.20]Cold resist.
[66:27.78]Yep.
[66:28.78]A helmet.
[66:29.32]Sure.
[66:32.32]Stop doing that.
[66:35.33]I want to identify this.
[66:36.33]Do you have any identify scrolls?
[66:38.91]In town, I do.
[66:40.38]Or you can buy them in town.
[66:41.64]Okay.
[66:42.40]Somebody's saying get twister.
[66:43.96]Is it good?
[66:45.56]It is good, but it mostly combos with the whirling slash that I don't think you want to do much of.
[66:49.96]Okay.
[66:52.84]Somebody said, hey, he's playing on a controller.
[66:54.56]Puke.
[66:59.77]Don't let him get to you.
[67:01.91]They're getting to me.
[67:03.47]The very first game they ever made for controller, Fable 1, was perfect with a controller.
[67:07.97]I was going to let you fight it.
[67:15.89]You can tag me in.
[67:17.41]You should be able to handle him.
[67:19.19]These are just regular enemies.
[67:22.69]Touch my obelisk.
[67:26.98]That's the obelisk.
[67:27.94]Wait, what are you... Oh, I thought I was gonna... Why are you down here?
[67:30.30]Oh, you're actually making me fight this by myself?
[67:32.04]I'm staying out of it.
[67:33.45]Alright, here we go.
[67:34.51]Obelisk of Rust.
[67:38.29]What is it?
[67:41.63]The Rust King.
[67:42.47]Ah, I remember this guy.
[67:50.34]Now this is where boys become men.
[68:27.69]I'm just locking in.
[68:28.46]I'm locking in.
[68:31.58]Going good.
[68:38.34]Don't.
[68:41.44]Hey man, thanks for power leveling me.
[68:44.24]You're welcome.
[68:49.95]Oh, that hurt.
[68:56.93]Oh shit, I got stunned.
[69:02.80]I gotta jump, I gotta jump.
[69:11.29]Uh, we're slowly making our way down to where you are.
[69:13.15]I guess if it comes all the way over here, I'll help.
[69:27.18]Are you actually making this have more health?
[69:30.00]Yeah.
[69:32.26]He's kicking the shit out of me.
[69:33.68]Why am I stunned?
[69:37.47]You need to not block for a second.
[69:39.19]Your stun meter needs to, like, recover.
[69:40.73]I'm gonna die.
[69:56.67]I'm dead.
[69:56.87]I'm dead.
[70:02.69]Get me.
[70:05.93]I was a believer.
[70:06.73]I'm playing with x2 health.
[70:12.59]I'm fighting a boss with like a double health boss.
[70:16.75]And now I'm gonna die again.
[70:21.87]Where are you going?
[70:25.03]I don't have any health potions.
[70:26.41]I was giving you a chance for glory.
[70:36.96]You're going to have to do it again.
[70:38.36]What the fuck did you do?
[70:39.42]Why did you die?
[70:40.52]What?
[70:41.78]You died?
[70:42.74]You're going to have to do it again.
[70:43.82]Why did you die?
[70:44.64]What do you mean I don't want to do it?
[70:45.58]I would have to do it again.
[70:46.60]I thought you wanted to do it again.
[70:49.04]I thought you wanted a redo.
[70:50.29]Your punishment is you have to read one of the CTAs right now.
[70:52.57]Do it.
[70:59.14]Man, guys, I hope you all check out Path of Exile 2 in early access.
[71:02.80]Dawn of the Hunt new league just came out.
[71:05.02]It's $30 to get early access, but also you get the full $30 worth of microtransactions in the game as though you had spent the $30 on not early access.
[71:13.95]Okay.
[71:14.55]What else?
[71:15.79]Also, all of the cosmetics and stash tabs that you buy transfer over to Path of Exile 1.
[71:20.33]Hope you try it sometime.
[71:23.12]And how many uniques are in the game in this update?
[71:26.07]100 new uniques and 100 new support gems as well as five new ascendancies.
[71:30.23]Very cool.
[71:31.13]Very cool.
[71:31.79]Thank you, by the way.
[71:34.66]No problem.
[71:40.48]I almost did it too.
[71:41.52]That's sad.
[71:46.82]Here tag team him.
[71:50.27]He's got twice as many health points.
[71:54.49]Now he actually is one of the earlier tricky bosses.
[71:57.76]He's pretty tricky, but he's it's doable.
[72:17.16]Man, I'm going to parry.
[72:18.72]Dude, phase two when he pulls out the Glock, though, you got to be careful.
[72:29.07]Oh, that hurt.
[72:30.07]I got killed.
[72:30.49]I need better armor.
[72:34.53]Should I just do checkpoint?
[72:42.95]You can if you want.
[72:44.07]I can kill him and revive you.
[72:47.30]Up to you, champ.
[72:50.62]I want to get the last hit.
[72:55.08]Okay.
[72:56.30]So do whatever you need to do to make sure I get the last hit.
[73:05.69]If you get hit, it interrupts the whole revive.
[73:10.67]Checkpoint is right here.
[73:13.27]wait is this gonna it is but it I think it resets the HP now if you respawn no just kill him you got it you got it this killed me so hard was I not reviving I
[73:44.14]You're watching your big brother play?
[73:45.54]I thought you died.
[73:52.06]I'm trying to get you.
[73:53.08]I'm trying to get you champ.
[74:02.03]Can you do it?
[74:09.09]Can somebody do it?
[74:19.95]Come on.
[74:20.49]I'm trying to help my friend.
[74:29.23]You get the last... You!
[74:30.83]What are you doing?
[74:32.25]I couldn't revive you.
[74:33.39]I tried.
[74:34.05]You should have just aggroed him all the way down to the other side of the map.
[74:38.72]Thank you, though.
[74:39.22]Nice job.
[74:40.42]You said you weren't going to yell at me anymore.
[74:41.92]Alright.
[74:44.08]Artificer's Orb.
[74:45.02]This one is interesting.
[74:48.48]Oh, no, it's not.
[74:50.09]It is.
[74:50.83]It is.
[74:52.75]Oh, level three.
[74:53.89]Alright, I need to go back to town.
[75:03.37]OK, this is important.
[75:05.83]Do I and I want to chat?
[75:07.49]I need your help here.
[75:09.77]Because I know we have the information booth here, but.
[75:18.52]Should I do Explosive Spear 3?
[75:21.38]Or get something else?
[75:24.26]Lightning Spear is here now.
[75:25.64]Call of the Week is very important.
[75:27.28]Okay.
[75:29.97]Dash to an enemy and run through.
[75:32.23]Calling enemies if their life is low enough.
[75:34.03]If this attack kills at least one enemy, it grants you a Frenzy Charge.
[75:37.55]Enemies around you that can be called will be highlighted.
[75:40.87]Wait.
[75:41.39]So I do this.
[75:42.17]If it kills anybody, I get to do the Explosive Spear again?
[75:45.45]Yeah, it's a lot easier than doing the whole parry every time.
[75:49.75]Oh shit.
[75:50.31]OK, that's a huge deal.
[75:51.56]What about the lightning spear?
[75:56.44]I would get that next.
[75:57.22]OK.
[76:02.20]I'll try it.
[76:02.58]OK.
[76:08.12]I should put this here.
[76:10.30]I'm not really doing whirling slash.
[76:11.72]What does it look like?
[76:15.62]so that it's like an execute it just kills everything right it'll like dash straight up to anything you see and there'll be like a perp uh a blue circle if you fight these guys over here once someone's in calling range you'll see the blue circle on them and it'll dash into them oh okay I see so now I have frenzy charges on right now yep and that counts as
[76:41.41]Okay, that's... Yep, and you have to limit one so you can do two of them now.
[76:45.98]Oh.
[76:46.18]Save the charges.
[76:46.76]Okay, cool.
[76:48.72]Very cool.
[76:52.56]Oh, hey, grab this spear.
[76:54.98]Because it already has a socket.
[76:56.82]It also has way more damage than the thing I have.
[77:01.74]I don't think we've dropped any runes.
[77:03.76]You can put runes in there and get good damage.
[77:06.46]I got a lot of shit.
[77:08.24]I got to get rid of a lot of stuff.
[77:28.19]Should I pick up any of this?
[77:29.07]Wait, yeah.
[77:38.44]Hello gamers, hope you're doing well.
[77:41.34]I'm starting to get a feel for it.
[77:43.38]Alright, do I want to keep anything?
[77:51.94]So here's the thing.
[77:52.40]This is my favorite feature about the stash tab stuff.
[77:56.75]Is...
[77:58.08]When I play an ARPG, I know a lot of people like this too.
[78:00.82]I know, Ster, you probably like this.
[78:03.18]I am such a collecting weirdo.
[78:06.57]Like, I hoard everything.
[78:07.79]I have like 10 different accounts that have like 10 different stashes.
[78:12.31]Oh, you had to do that in D2.
[78:13.33]Because you had to like pass all your stuff over to someone else with a different stash.
[78:17.88]So, this tab here is just, it's the unique tab.
[78:23.64]If you want to collect uniques, you just, you can collect everything, and it goes in one spot over here.
[78:30.41]Every spear in the game, every helmet in the game, and it has its own little slot.
[78:35.13]I don't have anything on this character yet, so.
[78:37.95]But it's like a little museum.
[78:39.56]I love it.
[78:42.24]This is a place to put your skill gems.
[78:43.80]It's so much more organized.
[78:45.62]All these materials I'm getting, they have their own little spot.
[78:48.50]They can stack.
[78:51.88]Without it, I was just like, shit was just filling every inventory.
[78:55.32]I just couldn't even keep track of it.
[78:57.62]Some people have a better system.
[78:58.58]Some people have better than I probably do, but I do appreciate the ability to do that.
[79:07.52]the hashtag ads in chat are funny because you genuinely were like so excited to figure out that existed that is like your number one favorite feature in path of exile is the collection museum it really is goodbye alright here we go something good that's alright welcome if I don't spirit hell
[79:39.49]Energy shield now.
[79:40.89]I don't really care about that right now, do I?
[79:45.37]About what?
[79:46.15]Energy shield.
[79:47.85]Energy shield is more of an intelligence thing.
[79:49.94]You're going to just want to probably be mostly evasion.
[79:52.74]OK.
[79:58.36]Oh, let me.
[79:58.90]Hey, hey, hey.
[80:02.24]Check this out.
[80:02.66]Ready?
[80:02.82]OK.
[80:03.94]This is what I was talking about.
[80:04.80]Ready?
[80:05.58]Boom.
[80:07.20]Boink.
[80:08.50]Boom.
[80:10.57]Boink.
[80:11.43]Oops.
[80:22.90]Boom.
[80:24.22]Boink.
[80:26.22]See, now it's so clean.
[80:31.50]Fuck, am I going to get addicted to playing Path of Exile 2?
[80:36.61]Ass.
[80:38.59]It's taking over my body.
[80:39.91]It's taking over me.
[80:47.55]Okay.
[80:49.41]I just want to get uniques.
[80:51.20]I hope we get a unique in this play through session here.
[80:54.42]My first playthrough this patch, act one, I got four.
[80:58.58]I was very lucky.
[80:59.54]What?
[81:02.68]Uh, where do we turn this in?
[81:03.48]Uh, up top to Renly.
[81:04.62]Oh, right.
[81:05.00]Okay.
[81:17.38]Looks good.
[81:19.58]Okay, do you have a better spear?
[81:24.32]This is 7 to 13.
[81:25.34]How much money do I have?
[81:26.32]200?
[81:29.26]Does this guy have just like a piece of shit spear that's better than what I have?
[81:33.07]He does.
[81:33.51]Alright.
[81:37.93]The vendors also refresh every time you level.
[81:40.75]It's good to check while playing through.
[81:48.13]But because yours already has the socket, if we do find a room, then it'd be better probably to make yours magic with the OK.
[81:57.27]I see.
[81:58.49]Unless one of those is crazy.
[82:01.79]Flat damage is huge right now though.
[82:05.89]Sounds cool.
[82:10.65]Alright, I think I'm pretty much ready.
[82:12.77]I do want some more.
[82:15.58]Wisdom Scrolls.
[82:18.40]I believe you buy them from Oona.
[82:20.32]Yep.
[82:21.83]These things are expensive early.
[82:22.87]I just wiped out my whole bank account.
[82:26.01]Alright, let's go.
[82:28.41]Travel to the Grelwood.
[82:29.71]We were just there, right?
[82:32.41]Yep, back to the waypoint, back to the Grelwood.
[82:36.27]I grew up in the Grelwood, actually.
[82:38.62]Oh, wait, no, we have to go back to Redvale and then walk backwards.
[82:43.70]We never got the waypoint.
[82:44.96]Oh, shit.
[82:45.50]Okay.
[82:50.54]Dude, you stored them and then just bought more.
[82:52.52]Did I actually?
[82:59.82]Did you?
[83:01.48]I think I did, yeah.
[83:02.46]Alright, I gotta get this down, so it's... I gotta get the frenzy charges and then throw a throw.
[83:18.92]You're killing them quick.
[83:21.16]Yeah, I'm surprised.
[83:21.78]I've got a really good scepter.
[83:28.06]They had the buff minions a lot in early game.
[83:29.96]They seem like they're doing a lot.
[83:31.00]Okay, there's one.
[83:37.62]How long do the charges last on you?
[83:39.10]A while.
[83:40.82]Timer on the top left.
[83:41.60]Oh, it's bottom left.
[83:44.63]15 seconds by default.
[83:45.89]And it refreshes if you get a new one.
[83:47.83]Cool.
[83:50.64]Holy shit.
[83:57.27]Alright.
[83:58.45]We're destroying these people.
[84:01.93]Yeah, so when the patch came out, that skill, the culling to get frenzy charges, didn't exist, which is why some people had tricky starts on Huntress.
[84:11.50]Yeah, they added it afterwards because they found people were having a hard time generating them.
[84:16.50]But I think now that Huntress has that,
[84:19.32]The flow of the character like ramps up a crazy amount.
[84:30.82]That's what I mean, like within a week after launch, they like added skills and and stuff was a ton of stuff added damn.
[84:39.44]I say I just dashed across school.
[84:45.80]Exile.
[84:46.60]Oh, oh, babe.
[84:53.79]Oh, medium mana flask.
[84:55.07]Yep.
[84:55.33]70 mana.
[85:00.03]Yeah.
[85:06.43]They're mine.
[85:11.56]Do you not like the boys?
[85:13.66]No, they're cool.
[85:16.50]keep them too distracted by the boys no do what you want to do we're gonna need it when we get to the act one boss because he is very very very wildly hard I love that boss he's really cool I love when he monologues me oh you who um shouldn't like you uh you shouldn't be in here
[85:47.84]I think that's what he says.
[85:48.70]Oh, who's that?
[85:50.64]Who's in there?
[85:55.08]Huh?
[85:57.07]In the hut.
[85:58.35]Oh, right.
[85:58.93]This is the witch.
[86:00.99]She's going to get annihilated.
[86:02.19]Flasks.
[86:25.74]I didn't even stand a chance.
[86:26.68]That's a wand.
[86:30.50]That is a wand.
[86:32.80]Bone blast.
[86:36.33]Bone blast.
[86:41.53]Okay, I want... So now... What should I do for disengage?
[86:48.49]What about call the weak?
[86:49.35]Hold on, let me see.
[86:52.79]You gain evasion rating.
[86:53.83]Profusion.
[86:54.93]You think that's what I'm going to do?
[86:57.01]Profusion is very good.
[87:00.67]That is very good.
[87:02.61]Additional charge.
[87:08.90]I like speed, but this one seems kind of impossible to replace.
[87:27.74]Attack speed works way better on other skills than that.
[87:29.96]That's true.
[87:32.02]You do have to do the windup.
[87:36.24]So now I have two charges.
[87:37.30]That's actually kind of crazy.
[87:39.80]Yup.
[87:49.49]So if you don't get the parry and you don't get a dash charge thing, you're kind of screwed, right?
[87:58.11]Um, yeah, you tend to feel a lot weaker.
[88:00.91]So you with the disengage, you remove the parody buff, so you're kind of you can still.
[88:07.46]If you carry them, get more damage without having to use frenzy charge stuff, but I'd say if you're going like thrown spears, you kind of need them like melee can get away with not doing as much.
[88:23.85]Dash is awesome too.
[88:26.33]Just fly around.
[88:29.85]Alright, stab the rune spikes into the tree of souls.
[88:33.63]Can you aim the spear wherever you want on the... Uh oh.
[88:39.43]I can use the right stick to aim.
[88:47.14]Oh, he's getting toasted.
[88:48.50]He's getting put in the oven for 350 for 25 minutes.
[88:56.24]Oh my god, he really is getting fucking destroyed.
[88:58.56]I didn't get a parry.
[89:13.71]He just got destroyed.
[89:14.73]Ah, you want a club?
[89:16.93]No.
[89:23.23]Do you want any of this stuff or am I going to take it all?
[89:26.25]You can have it all.
[89:26.83]You can also, you can disenchant rares.
[89:29.89]That's true.
[89:30.37]Regal orbs that let you turn your stuff into rares.
[89:33.03]That's true.
[89:33.73]I don't think I have any other moves.
[89:45.88]Oh, we've got, we've got the Giga combo.
[89:49.54]We do?
[89:50.66]We do.
[89:54.09]I forgot.
[89:55.83]Hold on.
[90:00.45]So I can do the skeletal snipers that follow me with the bows.
[90:05.48]And when I activate their thingy, they shoot gas cloud and your spear should blow that up.
[90:11.26]And that deals bonkers damage because it's usually really annoying to do by yourself.
[90:15.10]You're kidding.
[90:19.44]You're kidding.
[90:20.92]Not kidding.
[90:22.83]not kidding real no it doesn't it does a ton yeah the the cloud explosion was 630 attack damage which is this at this point most skills are like 120.
[90:47.70]So what you're saying is we're going to what's the word?
[90:51.27]Decimate.
[90:52.91]We're going to blow up the gas.
[91:00.91]Gas.
[91:01.27]Gas.
[91:02.77]It should be like bottom left is the tree on the map.
[91:15.70]Yeah, it's down there.
[91:17.18]Waypoint.
[91:21.67]This map is very big.
[91:23.93]This is a lot of stuff to find on it.
[91:30.41]Right, this is where the hooded one, the stranger.
[91:34.35]Want me to do it?
[91:36.01]Yeah.
[91:41.52]What are we doing as classes?
[91:42.40]I am Huntress and Ster is a sorceress.
[91:47.48]Sorceress.
[92:01.21]Are you going to nail them in?
[92:05.32]Saucity.
[92:07.88]Oh, now that's co-op.
[92:08.96]Oh, there it is.
[92:09.64]By decree of the Count of Orgrim.
[92:11.34]I don't want anyone in this area.
[92:12.58]Everyone stay out of my house.
[92:14.32]... ... ... ...
[92:29.14]In death you are not back to town.
[92:33.58]I thought your frog was part of this.
[92:39.90]So we get the.
[92:42.22]Get him off of the tree.
[92:44.68]Go back to town.
[92:45.26]Talk to Una.
[92:46.20]His unconscious breathing.
[92:47.91]This is content that was in the game before.
[92:51.89]You haven't seen it.
[92:53.59]Recommend it a recommend.
[93:07.96]You are now breathing manually?
[93:09.16]Actually, do you still need to talk to her in town?
[93:15.48]Uh, you do.
[93:17.34]Because he's laying on the ground.
[93:20.18]Yeah, we need to go to the Grim Tangle to revive him.
[93:26.74]Only the Count can release the binding.
[93:28.54]I know an old tale.
[93:31.32]One that speaks of a ring we might be able to recover.
[93:34.66]Buried three centuries ago in our ancient graveyard.
[93:38.63]Count Signet Ring.
[93:40.45]Bearing his rune of authority.
[93:42.63]But how to reach it in time?
[93:48.79]We can hear her?
[93:49.53]Oh, right.
[93:52.92]I was just like matching her.
[93:55.52]Huh?
[93:55.76]Should I just do that?
[93:56.68]Well, let me do that one too.
[94:06.36]I heard... I gotta get a perfect... I heard you're heading for the village.
[94:12.00]When I fled for my life, there was no time for me to grab my smithing... I fucked up.
[94:16.93]I don't care.
[94:18.21]My smitten.
[94:20.09]I'm quite smitten.
[94:21.19]Alright, Augrum Village.
[94:25.43]Go to Augrum Village.
[94:27.33]Turn to the entrance.
[94:28.11]Alright, you ready?
[94:32.53]Yep.
[94:34.55]After you.
[94:37.95]Grim Tangle.
[94:41.17]And then use the checkpoint to teleport to the Grim Tangle on the top right.
[94:50.20]I got all this shit on me.
[94:57.16]Hold on.
[94:59.37]You want this?
[95:00.37]Yes.
[95:00.77]It's probably better than what I have, is it?
[95:07.87]uh is seven decks better than max health uh no you always want max health okay next time you die if you had seven more health you would have lived through
[95:40.86]Alright, do the roots.
[95:44.38]I remember this was kind of hard.
[95:47.15]Kind of hard?
[95:47.81]Oh, wrong way.
[95:49.11]Yeah, this zone was really messed up before with every mushroom guy would explode on death.
[95:55.97]I think it's pretty toned down.
[95:59.42]Wait, how come you could just run through that?
[96:02.28]I couldn't.
[96:04.04]Oh, I probably talked to her before you did.
[96:08.40]I think our NPCs are like client-side.
[96:11.62]Oh, there you go!
[96:12.10]There's a Root Bomb!
[96:12.72]What is that?
[96:13.12]That's a robust rune.
[96:15.29]One of the new ones that doesn't have damage.
[96:17.19]Six strength, six strength.
[96:20.63]Is that... That's not good?
[96:23.63]Nah.
[96:24.45]Ster's probably so happy right now.
[96:26.15]Ster's been waiting for this moment for like seven and a half years.
[96:31.75]Yup.
[96:39.71]my true my true moment will come when you get to uh maps in poe one that's when I reach full power and at that point I can no longer be stopped I'm gonna get to my first map and you're gonna be like you're gonna turn purple that was fast oh alright
[97:07.10]I'm gassing him.
[97:09.74]Exploding!
[97:11.74]Oh, he moved.
[97:12.52]I can't tell if it's parrying him.
[97:36.89]Yikes.
[97:41.13]Here we go.
[97:50.18]These things are fucking smacking me!
[97:52.84]No, but really, he was hitting me.
[97:57.10]No!
[98:24.65]Alright, parry.
[98:25.37]This guy's hard to parry.
[98:30.39]I don't think I can.
[98:32.71]He has one or two attacks that you can, but not most.
[98:47.62]And you can use your culling dash on bosses even.
[98:51.22]Yep.
[98:55.80]Alright, that's a chance shard.
[98:59.26]So you get 10 of those, you make an orb of chance.
[99:01.40]Those are worth a lot, right?
[99:04.54]A little bit.
[99:05.86]They either delete an item or turn them into unique.
[99:11.18]What?
[99:12.16]It deletes the item?
[99:13.98]Yeah, it either vanishes or it turns into unique of the same type.
[99:18.75]That one's pretty good.
[99:19.63]Five decks on a weapon.
[99:24.21]It's a gamba orb.
[99:24.91]No.
[99:29.80]Oh, I love the rings.
[99:33.62]When I played last time, I had a tab that just had like 50 of these.
[99:40.01]And I would try to get... See, this is 28.
[99:42.05]It rolled between 20 and 30%.
[99:45.54]This one's a good roll.
[99:47.10]I was so obsessed with just having it all be perfect rolls.
[99:51.97]I needed to have at least three per... What is that?
[99:55.21]Dude, if you get to end game and actually play PeeWee 1 or 2, it will break you.
[100:02.09]Yeah?
[100:02.45]I've seen all of the evidence that it will, like, destroy you.
[100:08.40]Because it's just like... That's a... Why?
[100:11.46]Because of your, like, collect-a-thon brain.
[100:13.44]And you were playing that one, like, economy space simulator game that one time.
[100:18.10]And I was like, this is just, like, Path of Exile trading.
[100:20.02]Oh, yeah.
[100:21.42]Yeah.
[100:25.54]Don't be a crafter.
[100:26.54]No, I don't craft anything.
[100:27.67]I just hold on to stuff.
[100:29.11]I just throw a sack across my shoulder and you hear a bunch of fucking pots and pans.
[100:36.81]I don't use anything.
[100:38.32]Yeah, I don't even sell it either.
[100:40.46]It's not for you.
[100:41.20]It's not for anything.
[100:41.82]It's not to be used.
[100:42.76]It's not for you.
[100:44.18]No, it's for me to hold on to forever and just look at.
[100:46.90]This isn't for you.
[100:55.05]Alright, so where we what are we doing now?
[101:03.27]You're going the right way.
[101:07.25]Golem.
[101:11.02]Yeah, OK, but imagine if if the one ring if they were like 700 of them.
[101:17.81]How fucked up would Gollum be?
[101:19.89]There's so many layers to like a perfect item that, I don't know, you might, you might turn into a Gollum.
[101:27.19]Imagine if Gollum, you know, if you saw how he was with one ring, what if he had like 70 of them?
[101:34.92]He wants it.
[101:35.92]We need 70 of them.
[101:38.56]No, that's, that's precious 66.
[101:47.29]You know, I'd put a ring on it.
[101:50.46]Gollum?
[101:52.18]Everyone loves Gollum.
[101:53.38]Why do we still have this crazy music going?
[101:54.90]What's going on here?
[101:59.68]That seems to happen if you have one of those wisps and then you just like never finish it.
[102:05.69]Wait, did I miss a wisp?
[102:07.39]I think the music just doesn't stop.
[102:09.73]Did we miss a wisp?
[102:10.59]That's like a huge part of Path of Exile 2 Dawn of the Hunt update.
[102:19.49]uh you need a support uh I think I'm good but I'll take it just to keep it oh well then see what I don't need that that'll just go in my bag it's gonna go in my bag this isn't for you this isn't for you mind if I roll need that was you in World of Warcraft wasn't it I kind of feel
[102:52.65]I'm also the you if you were to open up my bag and take a look I know where everything was So like if you were to oh, I'm gonna look at I'm gonna look at Jerma's inventory.
[103:03.21]What's he got here?
[103:03.81]Oh cool, like feathered robe ashen staff.
[103:06.51]That's cool and This alright.
[103:08.85]Yeah.
[103:09.91]Yeah.
[103:10.17]Well, he didn't know I did that I would come back and I would be like oh
[103:14.50]My things!
[103:15.48]What have you... No!
[103:16.78]This goes here, and you move this over... What have you done?
[103:19.56]The Dewey Decimal System.
[103:21.30]No!
[103:21.44]The Dewey Decimal System!
[103:22.56]I know you touched my things.
[103:24.01]It was supposed to be like this!
[103:25.83]That would actually happen.
[103:26.63]Okay, you're messed up, dude.
[103:32.61]Okay.
[103:38.14]I like ARPGs.
[103:39.90]It's like my one thing that I like in video games.
[103:43.16]Is your one thing?
[103:45.62]And I haven't gotten you to play the maps?
[103:48.84]Is your literal one thing?
[103:50.30]What do I have to do?
[103:59.51]I worded that wrong.
[104:02.87]There is nothing else I like in gaming.
[104:08.51]Yeah, dude, it's my one thing that I like.
[104:11.13]Why won't you do it with me?
[104:18.76]He's hamming it up.
[104:20.40]You've been playing this off stream and you're a pro and you just don't want me to know about it.
[104:27.94]Uh, somebody hold on.
[104:29.10]Wait, wait, wait.
[104:30.46]Well, judging by his current gameplay, I don't think that that's true.
[104:33.66]Omega long.
[104:36.90]Right, right.
[104:37.64]Somebody said it probably.
[104:38.38]I want to pick this up.
[104:48.95]Frozen help.
[104:55.49]You just like crashed my computer.
[104:56.71]You did so much damage so quickly.
[104:58.93]Oh, that's the triple gas cloud.
[105:01.26]Hitting them with the triple.
[105:08.70]First time chatter ever.
[105:10.52]Hey Jerma, what does Omega Lull mean?
[105:12.24]I don't get it.
[105:13.01]I mean, that could be a real person.
[105:18.29]You never know.
[105:30.80]uh it's like a guffaw oh you're still you're thinking about that the whole time what did he mean by that that kind of was not really but a little what what did he mean by that oh this is the this is a boss coming up right
[105:57.73]Uh, quite a few in a row.
[106:01.41]This area was fun.
[106:02.17]I like this area.
[106:03.05]Wait, I got a point to put in.
[106:04.05]Alright, now this is where... Okay, so Path of Exile.
[106:11.06]This is where I get a little crossed up here.
[106:14.56]So, I'm good to go through... I get this, right?
[106:19.66]I get these first three points.
[106:22.22]I don't understand where else to go.
[106:26.24]um so the next ones right like as you continue forward I think one of them is projectile damage yeah and that's what you want to do because then you don't you don't you work backwards too you kind of go find the thing that you really want to get and you sort of go I'm gonna what's the easiest highway to take to get there right yeah
[106:52.90]I'd say they made respeccing really easy.
[106:54.88]So you just use gold to respect and it's very easy in the early game.
[106:57.94]So I would just take like whatever immediate damage you can get and then like later when you wanted to like really think about it.
[107:04.42]You can you can also search to write you can also type in like projectile speed and all these will light up right?
[107:10.74]Yeah, cool.
[107:13.71]Oh yeah, this is electrocute build up shock chance.
[107:18.25]Let me just take a look at this for one minute here.
[107:20.67]What is this one?
[107:22.98]Can't be critically hit while parrying.
[107:24.56]That seems kind of good.
[107:28.10]Parry debuff duration.
[107:29.55]What does that mean?
[107:32.13]How long they have the damage bonus taken.
[107:34.21]But you're usually consuming it with the backflip.
[107:36.71]True.
[107:37.21]Okay, so maybe I don't want to go that way.
[107:39.71]Yeah, the tooltips on everything also really helps learn PoE 2 faster.
[107:44.27]Does.
[107:45.97]Elemental ailment threshold is for like shocks and stuff, right?
[107:50.01]Yeah, so you don't get frozen.
[107:52.86]I mean, accuracy rating is probably good.
[107:54.78]I mean, just take, wait, what about going this way?
[108:01.35]Uh, every dexterity is accuracy rating.
[108:03.75]So you usually don't need too much as a dex character.
[108:09.47]100% crit on full life enemies.
[108:10.77]That seems kind of insane.
[108:18.44]Uh, it's 100% increased crit damage.
[108:21.44]Oh, that's huge, though.
[108:23.56]But you got a crit, then.
[108:24.58]Maybe I should get that.
[108:29.38]Poisoned.
[108:31.48]Let me type in, um... How do I do this?
[108:35.05]How do I filter the search?
[108:38.09]How do I type in?
[108:38.79]I don't know on controller.
[108:40.37]If I'm a controller, Andy, how do I type in things to look at?
[108:48.38]Well, I know I'm getting this anyway, so... L3?
[108:50.56]Oh, okay.
[108:53.73]Add new filter.
[108:54.79]Oh, there we go.
[108:55.25]Okay.
[108:56.17]So, I want to do... What should I do?
[109:00.02]Area of effect?
[109:00.74]Projectile?
[109:01.46]Speed, maybe?
[109:02.04]Oops.
[109:03.30]Oops.
[109:12.11]A lot of the most accessible things I think near Hunter for you are going to just say elemental damage.
[109:16.65]Right.
[109:17.87]Fire?
[109:18.39]There's no like explicit fire nodes on the side of the tree, but there is a ton of just elemental.
[109:23.74]And then once you get to the lightning spear, it'll apply to that as well.
[109:26.96]So I should go for offensive damage.
[109:33.84]I don't see elemental damage type on the filter.
[109:43.13]Elemental's not on here.
[109:43.91]I don't know why.
[109:46.11]We'll just damage.
[109:47.16]Oh, shit.
[109:47.88]That's why.
[109:48.22]Alright.
[109:48.68]Elemental damage.
[109:50.06]So now those are lit up.
[109:56.38]Okay.
[109:56.86]Save changes.
[109:57.52]Okay.
[109:57.76]So here we go.
[109:59.72]So here is... Accuracy rating.
[110:04.41]Is that elemental?
[110:05.01]Here we go.
[110:05.27]Alright.
[110:05.53]So this is the one I want over here.
[110:06.71]15% increased damage for each type of elemental ailment on the target.
[110:13.53]Elemental damage, elemental damage, elemental damage, elemental damage, elemental damage.
[110:17.27]This is freeze though, but still.
[110:19.90]So I want to go up kind of this way.
[110:20.92]Oh, there's some to your south that are pretty good.
[110:24.14]Oh shit.
[110:25.58]Attack damage, attack damage.
[110:28.38]Oh fuck, it's this one here.
[110:31.61]Yeah.
[110:31.83]But if you just went like down that straight line that kind of comes straight from where your character was, you can like grab all the stuff on the side and not worry too much and just... I think that's the plan.
[110:41.29]You'll like bump into stuff and see stuff that you'll figure out later.
[110:44.48]So I'll go down here.
[110:48.58]Straight down this road and get there as fast as I can.
[110:50.88]Alright, got it.
[110:52.18]Let's go.
[110:55.00]Look at me planning my build.
[111:01.38]You died?
[111:03.10]Yeah.
[111:03.54]This guy's going to hurt a lot.
[111:13.82]Thanks.
[111:14.68]Oh, sorry.
[111:16.06]Thanks, measly worm.
[111:17.66]No, that's the wrong one too.
[111:19.43]Thanks, measly worm.
[111:22.13]You're very welcome.
[111:29.25]No problem.
[111:33.24]Ah, ancient rune.
[111:37.02]What lies in this sarcophagus?
[111:41.43]Be avenged.
[111:44.13]There's going to be a ring when he collects it.
[111:46.43]My dearest daughter.
[111:47.61]My dearest daughter.
[111:49.13]And?
[111:50.23]My dearest daughter.
[111:52.77]My dearest daughter.
[111:55.01]They're trying us, I swear.
[111:57.17]Wait, are any of these perfect rolls?
[111:58.99]Excuse me.
[111:59.41]Rest well.
[112:01.18]How much was that?
[112:03.08]Oh, dang it.
[112:06.10]Not good enough.
[112:06.66]Not a perfect roll.
[112:12.58]Are you the kind of guy to want like a perfectly rolled unique item?
[112:16.00]Yes.
[112:18.44]Yeah, you're cursed.
[112:20.44]That's a tough struggle to live with.
[112:23.16]I don't even want to use it.
[112:24.64]I want to drop it on the ground in town and then pick it up really quickly before somebody gets it and say, hey, look at the stats.
[112:36.57]I want to write in chat, Perf Buckler, Perf Buckler, and then say LOL, LOL, and then show it.
[112:43.24]And then... Oh, hold on a second.
[112:44.48]We're getting killed.
[112:46.50]I'm in trouble.
[112:48.08]I got frozen.
[112:49.14]I did too.
[112:49.72]Five ever.
[112:53.12]Oh, God.

[113:51.14]Yeah, we failed.

[116:24.44]Ster is doing a great job helping me learn.
[116:27.76]Check the logs.
[116:29.63]Has he been being nice?
[116:30.81]I absolutely have been.
[116:36.39]And you know what else is nice?
[116:39.97]Path of Exile 2 in Early Access?
[116:42.03]Something like that.
[116:44.15]I was thinking more along the lines of, you know...
[116:53.76]A nice lemonade on a hot day, laying out in the sun, bouncing around a beach ball.
[116:59.76]You know, let's name some interesting things, like, for the summertime, right?
[117:02.58]Like, you go first.
[117:04.26]Like you just said, nice beach ball, laying out in the sun.

[117:09.45]Now, and so I have to go twice.
[117:11.61]Yeah, alright, so laying out, laying out in the sun with a nice beach ball, a nice, you know, maybe like a nice tea or something, you know?

[117:29.43]Ice cream truck getting a cool ice cream.

[117:39.14]No, they still have them.
[117:42.03]Catching some waves.
[117:43.37]Like I said, I'm talking about beach summertime stuff.
[117:47.05]Planting flowers in spring.
[117:49.79]Sunflowers or marigolds are really nice too this time of year.
[117:56.23]And Path of Exile going into early access.

[123:00.06]Come on.
[123:04.21]I rolled into them.
[123:05.01]It's called panicking.
[123:07.23]I panicked.
[123:08.37]You guys have never panicked before?
[123:09.87]Are you serious?
[123:11.39]Not even when you're late to go to the airport?
[123:14.91]At some point when you get the... There you go.
[123:18.35]Oh, no.
[123:18.83]You're dead, I think.
[123:19.45]Get us out of here quick.

[123:25.80]Good job, dude.
[123:41.63]No!
[123:44.45]Help!
[123:49.58]No way, this guy streamed PeeWee 2 and died to Prison of Bone.
[123:55.13]Yeah, it's hard.
[123:56.25]I'm calling strike.
[124:01.10]I got out.
[124:03.98]You get the last hit.
[124:07.07]We did it.
[124:07.45]Nice job, dude.
[124:08.61]Alright, Unique, come on.
[124:10.21]That's the same voice I would make when I die.
[124:12.09]I laugh at her every time.
[124:24.87]Yeah, we did do it together.
[124:25.95]I was, she was at like 20% health when I died.
[124:29.69]Yeah.
[124:30.39]Iron crown.
[124:31.43]Cool.
[124:35.25]So are you doing the thing where you're letting me pick up all this stuff so I have like a good experience and then I continue to play with you like tomorrow?
[124:42.92]Um, I don't know if I'd consider that whole loop to be the experience, but a little bit.
[124:54.76]I mean, I can do more with less.
[124:56.24]I know you want to see the loot.
[125:02.90]I mean, if you want me to unleash right now, I could unleash my full potential.
[125:07.36]I would like you to look at that because it's got mana.
[125:11.58]I can't wear it.
[125:12.12]I found a plus one to minions.
[125:14.21]You got a plus one?
[125:14.95]I got a plus one.
[125:17.23]Kind of better than what I have.
[125:21.80]Light radius, life regen.
[125:24.94]Wait, 13% increased critical hit chance.
[125:27.57]That's wild.
[125:31.45]So people always misunderstand that.
[125:32.95]If you look at your spear, it has a base crit chance.
[125:36.59]And then 13% increased is increased of that, which I believe is 5%.
[125:40.77]Okay, I see.
[125:41.07]So it is not a flat 13% crit chance.
[125:42.27]I got it.
[125:42.77]Cool.
[125:54.47]cool alright uh do you what do you want to see a cool staff maybe 20 increase cast speed um I have a plus one fizz wand and a plus one minion helmet and I have fizz minions so they're plus you know minion skill levels and they're gonna blast okay I'm just gonna sell all this shit alright let's do it back to town
[126:28.04]Increased as a percentage, more is added.
[126:30.50]Yeah, there's like two different ways to say it in the game, right?
[126:42.03]How's the clearing?
[126:43.73]Alright, let me first thing you do after a successful hunt.
[126:50.01]Jump these.
[126:56.11]Chance shard claw.
[127:03.23]Alright, skill gems.
[127:05.41]This is where it just starts to line him up.
[127:10.59]Cool.
[127:14.21]I mean, just put these on.
[127:15.20]I don't have anything better.
[127:19.04]Wait 28% unidentified fire resistance, huh?
[127:30.48]Sell this other trash.
[127:32.59]Whoa.
[127:34.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[127:36.07]What's up?
[127:37.77]Simmer down with that talk.
[127:39.91]I keep thinking this person is an NPC and I keep trying to talk to them.
[127:51.30]Should you always disenchant yellows or should you just sell them?
[127:55.17]um either are valid in the campaign so if you're selling them then you want to like event you want to check vendors for items more often with gold and if you're disenchanting them you get more regal orbs but you can really go either way with it kind of about the money I think money is generally better yeah okay especially because you're gonna probably want to respec or something later too probably
[128:29.23]You don't have any supports, do you?
[128:31.41]I do.
[128:31.83]What do you need?
[128:33.56]I need one support.
[128:37.58]Hey, level one support.
[128:38.52]Trade.
[128:39.58]Trade.
[128:40.78]Trade coming in.
[128:41.58]Trade.
[128:42.04]Where are you?
[128:43.36]Oh, there you are.

[128:46.50]Trade.
[128:46.78]There you go.
[128:54.82]I'll take, yeah, that sounds good.
[128:56.10]It's a good trade, I think.
[128:56.98]Yeah.
[128:57.84]Pretty good.
[128:58.44]Thank you.
[129:01.66]I'll buy it at a high price.
[129:03.80]Two mana per killed, 12 max life.
[129:06.34]Seems good.
[129:10.30]Take the resistance.
[129:12.72]Oh, boy.
[129:14.96]Seven to 13, one to five.
[129:16.48]Three mana per killed.
[129:21.48]Alright, Ster.
[129:22.36]Ster!
[129:23.48]Yeah?
[129:24.51]okay uh I have a seven to thirteen one to five lightning damage spear uh I also have a seven to thirteen just white iron head spear with a socket which one of these two uh for what I got you never used the augmentation orbs on the socket spear I did not no and you have that iron rune
[129:51.25]I do so I would augment the spear see if you get a flat fizz or an added fizz I like fizz as in like carbonation or fizz as in what do you mean uh physics zeke's your physique if you use the augmentation orb on it okay I only get okay magic item so you want me to turn this into magic then augment it okay
[130:19.73]Dude, I just got 45% increased physical damage.
[130:23.03]This thing is going to be... Okay, yeah, then add the other mod.
[130:26.63]And then I would... 6% attack speed?
[130:31.45]I would equip the iron ring you have in your stash as well as very strong.
[130:35.48]Really?
[130:37.26]And I would also augment the iron ring with mods.
[130:44.26]Oh, okay.
[130:45.82]and then maybe use the iron rune or one of the other runes that adds damage into the spear cold damage no but I'm used I don't mana per killed okay alright and now you want you I should put the the rune in here dexterity or physical damage uh damage can I take this out no no I don't think I don't want to use it this is a chip gem
[131:18.54]This is a chipped ruby that dropped in Andariel's lair.
[131:22.74]Okay, alright, alright, alright.
[131:25.36]Alright, I'm just... I got... Alright, this thing's 11 to 21 now.
[131:31.26]This is a chipped gem.
[131:35.91]Dude, I almost want to open up my other character and just see how much shit I just have in my inventory.
[131:46.49]Okay.
[131:47.71]Cool.
[131:52.20]So I'm going to be doing a lot more damage now.
[131:53.48]Good.
[131:54.52]What have we got next?
[131:58.33]Oh, next we are teleporting back to the cemetery.
[132:07.74]And we need to look for the other dome.
[132:10.12]Oh, that's right.
[132:10.64]There's the second one.
[132:16.12]The blue orbs are lesser runes are like spending pennies.
[132:18.62]It's fine.
[132:19.25]Cool.
[132:34.71]Back to cemetery.
[132:46.98]I can already feel how much more damage I'm doing now.
[132:54.66]very good very good also for those of you wondering if you don't really play poe or you don't know I have an item filter thing on Ster made it specifically it's a custom one so if you play the game and you're like why does my game not do this uh there's lots of cool item filters that do different things when different things drop different sounds different um little graphical cool things stirs Ster made this one
[133:26.01]It couldn't get really custom, so you could have like a different sound for 15 gold dropping and 14 gold.
[133:32.10]Really?
[133:33.06]You can really do like anything with it.
[133:34.48]Alright, so I'm going down here, right?
[133:45.82]Oh, level!
[133:46.34]Am I going the right way?
[133:48.82]Wait, I'm going the right way.
[133:50.12]Yes, I am.
[133:50.50]Okay.
[133:52.10]I gotta go down this way.
[133:59.49]More accuracy is always good.
[134:05.68]Do you need that?
[134:07.10]Nope.
[134:18.24]No one.
[134:21.00]Oops, oops.
[134:25.49]Oh, somebody asked if the controller is fun.
[134:30.36]It is my preferred way to play.
[134:34.15]That might make me a noob.
[134:36.23]That's alright.
[134:36.61]I think it's amazing at everything besides inventory management.
[134:39.97]So they had been talking about adding a feature.
[134:41.65]I don't know if it's in yet where you could just like hot swap between mouse and keyboard and controller.
[134:46.59]That might not be in yet, but when it is like I think controllers are really good, but just like trying to like manage your inventory can go so much faster with a keyboard.
[134:54.23]Yeah, being able to have the mouse would be awesome eventually.
[134:56.89]OK, this is.
[134:57.45]This is going to be cool.
[135:01.17]Contains identified items.
[135:03.45]76% enchanted quantity of contained items.
[135:07.43]You ready to do this?
[135:08.69]Wait, is this one of the new ones?
[135:10.13]Isn't there a new lockbox thing in the game?
[135:11.83]The new ones are unique.
[135:12.77]This is not one of them.
[135:13.87]Cool, okay.
[135:15.91]Alright, let's do it.
[135:19.53]Be careful.
[135:21.29]I will.
[135:21.75]You're in for a scare.
[135:23.19]So many explosions.
[135:36.30]There's so many people to explode, but... What's your favorite R.L.
[135:46.21]Stine?
[135:46.57]I feel like you'd be an R.L.
[135:49.47]Stine guy.
[135:50.65]Yeah, what's wrong with that?
[135:52.47]What's your favorite one?
[135:54.29]That's all I'm saying.
[135:55.97]Um... The dummy one.
[136:02.96]Because you can relate to it?
[136:06.63]very funny uh I also like the mask one mask one was really scary what was the deal with the photograph one I don't really take someone's picture and they their soul gets trapped in it oh yeah there was some bangers that that was a great show it was a great book I think I liked the dummy one and then they made like 16 of them
[136:29.37]Yeah, they really was.
[136:30.11]It's like, oh, the dummy up in my attic.
[136:32.21]Five.
[136:33.86]The dummy in the basement.
[136:35.08]The dummy runs like a restaurant.
[136:37.36]Yeah, they did do a lot of dummies.
[136:53.44]Covers were great.
[136:54.12]Yeah, the covers were really good.
[136:57.94]I remember the Abominable Snowman one.
[136:59.72]That one was a good one too.
[137:00.60]I don't remember that.
[137:03.52]The Abominable Snowman of... What was it?
[137:07.16]It was from some town or something, right?
[137:10.81]I think so.
[137:11.27]It sounds familiar.
[137:13.83]I think there's one where... I think I've read the actual book where you turn into a werewolf at a circus.
[137:21.99]Oh, yeah.
[137:23.54]Yeah, I based my life around that.
[137:28.72]How many Goosebumps books were there actually?
[137:35.00]It was like 100, wasn't it?
[137:36.02]Like 1 to 200?
[137:39.17]Thousands.
[137:39.73]I don't know.
[137:40.03]I feel like you'd open a cereal box and just pull out a book.
[137:44.81]They're putting them everywhere.
[137:48.71]I miss like book fair in middle school.
[137:51.29]Yeah.
[137:51.53]The whole class would go down to the library and buy books.
[137:54.54]talked about this recently um did you yeah about just uh what are these I god I I don't remember getting a lot at those but one of the books I did get they recently made a movie of that uh not not well received if there's any Artemis foul enjoyers
[138:22.67]Yeah, I was an Artemis Fowl kid.
[138:25.49]I think.
[138:26.05]I don't know.
[138:26.37]It was a long time ago.
[138:27.31]I don't remember.
[138:28.27]Recently?
[138:28.69]That was a few years ago.
[138:30.97]Wait, I thought you were talking about when you were a kid.
[138:33.80]Yeah.
[138:34.54]No, Artemis Fowl, the book, was like a kid's book.
[138:38.57]Oh, but did you say a few years ago?
[138:40.91]No, a few years ago they made a movie.
[138:42.75]Oh, I thought you were saying.
[138:43.82]It has like nothing to do with the book.
[138:45.80]It's very weird.
[138:47.96]Very weird adaptation.
[138:49.42]It's kind of like if, I don't know, they gave Harry Potter an AK.
[138:53.84]Like, why does he have that?
[138:57.22]I don't remember that from the book.
[138:59.60]Aren't there secret little things here?
[139:02.01]Uh, quite a few.
[139:03.33]I think there is there.
[139:04.95]Ah, yeah.
[139:06.73]I'm going to get it all if you don't get down here.
[139:09.88]no no no oh you should get it all please please play tomorrow please play tomorrow no I because I'm already on the account that has like I've like a lot of money already uh I don't really need oh maybe that more chargers are always good yeah
[139:39.02]Oh, a belt, finally.
[139:46.17]Okay, Ray's shield is this... I shouldn't take that if I want parry, right?
[139:51.33]Yeah, you need a buckler.
[139:55.41]Okay, I'm doing explosive spear level three.
[139:57.38]60% more damage.
[140:11.77]Yeah.
[140:15.53]And then disengage level three.
[140:18.37]What is rake?
[140:24.47]Bleed.
[140:25.69]Ow.
[140:28.12]How does controller see the videos of the skills?
[140:30.42]Oh, toggle video.
[140:33.38]Why?
[140:35.12]Seems to just give me an audio file.
[140:37.66]Oh, wait.
[140:40.60]Maybe I have to do this.
[140:44.37]No.
[140:46.53]Disengage.
[140:48.55]Maybe I can't see it right now.
[140:50.29]Alright, disengage.
[140:53.15]OK, hold on.
[140:56.13]About Perry.
[141:05.28]Break armor.
[141:06.08]Let me see some of the other ones.
[141:15.88]shock chance that's kind of good supported skills deal 25 more melee damage if you have damaged an enemy with a projectile in the last eight seconds is that good yep that's good or disengage and more is the multiplier that makes it good yeah
[141:48.06]Get the tempo for it.
[141:50.18]Where is that?
[141:53.52]Faster attack speed for disengage.
[142:00.06]There's so much shit.
[142:01.84]So of the of the new.
[142:04.64]100 support gems.
[142:06.46]Are they just sprinkled out through levels 1234?
[142:08.30]Are they just everywhere?
[142:09.80]Are they in a certain tier?
[142:12.70]Uh, they're everywhere.
[142:15.20]A good chunk of them, like I said, are just for Huntress.
[142:18.58]And then there's a lot of really weird ones added to fill in gaps of skills that didn't have too many before.
[142:25.53]I'll try attack speed.
[142:28.61]Yeah, martial tempo is one of the best early.
[142:31.79]So it just happens faster?
[142:33.21]You just kind of like, bink?
[142:35.91]Oh, on your disengage, you should put that on the skill you're using the most often.
[142:39.98]Oh, I just put it on... Like if you're doing throw spear.
[142:42.16]I put it on disengage.
[142:43.12]Oh, okay.
[142:46.69]Let's go.
[142:47.33]I got it on disengage, man.
[142:51.15]Alright.
[142:52.37]Then you flip slightly faster.
[142:56.96]Sick.
[142:57.68]Do you need a level three?
[142:58.40]Yeah, I can change it.
[142:59.82]I'll change it in a minute.
[143:02.38]Let me go back down.
[143:03.02]No, I'm good.
[143:08.05]I got a bunch of trash.
[143:09.15]Get rid of this junk.
[143:15.64]How much faster is the flip?
[143:18.42]Actually is a lot faster.
[143:19.72]Yeah, which is why it's good on your attack skills.
[143:26.34]Yeah, let's do a bastard flip man.
[143:28.08]That's good.
[143:36.23]OK, be careful with this guy.
[143:37.19]He can blast you.
[143:38.11]He's got the shotgun.
[143:39.05]Yep, I'll be very careful in locking in.
[143:41.69]Comes in with a fully loaded buckshot.
[143:54.07]I think I'm putting him in minion town you are oh yeah his projectiles don't even come out he's in the hedge maze parry coming out boys
[144:18.54]No parry?
[144:19.71]What?
[144:28.34]Oh, he just stunned me.
[144:30.56]No!
[144:31.94]Yeah, if he does that shotgun sword swing and you parry it, you just fall over.
[144:41.14]Do you hear her?
[144:41.78]It's Poke's nerd voice.
[144:43.24]I am here.
[144:46.02]I will help you.
[144:48.74]I keep trying to fucking parry.
[144:49.96]It's always a disaster.
[144:50.80]Stop me.
[144:58.91]Asenia, join me.
[145:23.57]Got it.
[145:24.01]Nice.
[145:28.17]Great, great job.
[145:30.19]Very good.
[145:31.03]Alright, we're almost done with this part, right?
[145:43.52]Yeah, you're getting carried really hard.
[145:47.48]Um?
[145:50.96]Well, I have the master of information with me.
[145:52.96]Of course, we're gonna do well.
[145:56.28]I got some really lucky item drops.
[145:57.76]I think my skeleton can, like, solo the game.
[145:59.80]If you guys are curious... If you guys are curious... Just put him in the box.
[146:13.32]It's like shooting fish in a barrel.
[146:19.07]oh uh come back to the door we're gonna teleport from the checkpoint down to the entrance we are both getting carried that's true uh and this is the unreal tournament boss we know the announcer oh yeah for some reason that announcer is a undead
[146:47.80]I remember this part.
[146:49.48]This part, I remember having to pee my... I had such a huge smile on my face.
[147:02.61]What is this?
[147:05.13]Graves, Isabelle, Torkel, Callum.
[147:10.18]The family of Count Lachlan of Ogham.
[147:13.12]My family.
[147:15.89]You're going to get one shot by Lachlan?
[147:17.93]No, I'm not.
[147:22.45]I think he's the hardest boss in Act 1.
[147:25.25]Really?
[147:25.65]But he's just kind of silly.
[147:26.73]So we're going to put him in the box.
[147:35.45]Oh, he killed me in one hit.
[147:36.85]They got me.
[147:37.77]Yep.
[147:38.01]They killed me in one hit.
[147:38.67]I was trying to parry him.
[147:43.81]I don't know what I can and can't parry.
[147:47.33]Most of his attacks, the slams that hit the ground, you cannot parry.
[147:50.19]Alright, I'm just going to stay back then and do my thing back here.
[148:01.98]So if I throw more than two, that's bad because then these will disappear.
[148:06.82]So let them explode, then go for it again.
[148:20.35]I mean, it does a lot of damage when it explodes.
[148:25.76]Oh, he got me.
[148:27.72]Want to get you?
[148:33.44]Hello, what the fuck just happened?
[148:37.42]OK, apparently couldn't remember this.
[148:39.30]I'll get him.
[148:43.43]If you stay close to him, he actually does less annoying attacks.
[148:47.47]Like all the ghosts he summons, he doesn't do as much.
[149:00.74]I'm telling you.
[149:02.06]Yeah, he kills me.
[149:03.89]All the ice everywhere too.
[149:05.09]I forgot how this guy sucks.
[149:28.86]Parried him.
[149:31.25]Damage.
[149:37.06]Gonna bury him.
[149:44.08]Ouch.
[149:55.22]Whoa, please.
[150:06.31]I want to get a support him to make those happen faster.
[150:08.15]I can do that, right?
[150:09.90]What happened faster?
[150:10.94]The explosions.
[150:14.30]No, I've heard that less duration doesn't work on it, but I don't know what that hurt me so bad.
[150:20.60]I don't even know what happened.
[150:25.15]Fuck, I can't bury that either.
[150:31.63]Damn it, this guy is so strong.
[150:43.89]Can I not revive you?
[150:45.03]What's going on?
[150:46.77]Oh, yeah, I had no weapon equipped that whole time.
[150:49.91]Because I was doing the parrying, it never switched back.
[150:52.61]Is there a reason why I couldn't revive you?
[150:55.79]Um, I don't know.
[150:56.83]I think the clicking on it has been a little weird for me.
[151:04.65]Oh, shit.
[151:05.25]People are betting on us.
[151:06.81]We have to get it this time.
[151:09.58]Okay, I'll focus up.
[151:13.50]this this one's real this is real this is real put this one in the phone book they're not even done betting they're not even done betting yet and we already lost okay hold on hold on hold on we gotta dodge around we gotta dash around and dodge around
[151:47.39]Alright, are you guys ready?
[151:51.15]Use that skill gem for explosive spear.
[151:54.99]Hold on.
[151:57.17]Oh, yeah.
[151:58.79]Hold on, hold on.
[151:59.57]Wait, wait, wait.
[152:00.83]Yeah.
[152:01.69]What's in here now?
[152:02.65]I've got... Okay, I've got plus one to the... Maybe I don't care about this.
[152:14.16]No, I like having the two out.
[152:17.13]Extra fire damage.
[152:25.68]Eventually you unlock this whole row, but.
[152:31.12]Let me try doing this.
[152:32.71]Now it'll be awhile.
[152:33.83]Yeah, I was told there is one that makes it explode faster.
[152:40.77]I just don't know the name of it.
[152:44.09]But I guess I could just do spear throw.
[152:51.41]Alright, Spear Throw.
[152:56.44]Expedite.
[152:59.64]Where'd it go?
[153:00.20]There it is.
[153:06.04]Oh, I can't... This support can't be socketed into this skill?
[153:08.83]I can't put this in Spear Throw?
[153:14.49]Um...
[153:18.34]Refusion?
[153:18.88]No, that's the gain an additional charge one.
[153:23.74]Oh shit, I want the attack speed one.
[153:25.32]Hold on, sorry.
[153:28.18]Where is that one?
[153:29.36]Oh, it's on disengage, right?
[153:30.66]Okay, explosive spear is going to stay the same.
[153:40.55]Now let's go back here.
[153:45.05]spear throw that's good okay what else should I put into spear throw anything can I do anything else it's like that's kind of all I have right now alright spear throw blind side cannot inflict blind critical damage bonus retreat
[154:11.19]25% more projectile damage if you have damaged an enemy with a melee hit in the last 8 seconds.
[154:18.43]Or... What else is here?
[154:23.24]Less projectile speed.
[154:24.32]Why would you want to do that?
[154:28.32]Ball lightning.
[154:34.78]Ball lightning.
[154:45.97]Non ailment.
[154:53.27]Um.
[154:53.47]I think I'm going to do this.
[154:56.07]Because.
[154:59.66]I mean, that's kind of the only thing I can really do with spear throw, right?
[155:06.42]I'll do it.
[155:06.82]It's a good one for now.
[155:08.96]OK, let's try it.
[155:12.54]I'm definitely throwing faster.
[155:15.19]Alright, I'm ready.
[155:15.69]We're ready.
[155:16.01]Alright, you guys ready?
[155:16.85]We're beating it right now.
[155:18.80]It's over.
[155:19.90]GG.
[155:42.13]What the fuck just happened?
[155:43.73]No!
[155:44.15]Oh my god, dude, he killed me.
[155:48.00]Shit.
[155:48.82]Yeah, he has this like AoE slam at a distance I've never even seen him do before.
[155:53.48]Because I'm usually right on top of him.
[155:57.12]Fuck.
[155:58.63]Okay.
[156:05.93]Maybe we should go level up, dude.
[156:10.33]Oh, we need very good.
[156:22.16]He's confused.
[156:24.38]That's he.
[156:25.30]He does make the noise when he does it.
[156:27.78]Strictly missile at me, it's homing.
[156:32.86]You OK bud?
[156:35.46]Yes.
[156:40.83]He's getting really confused.
[156:42.23]Yeah, he has no idea.
[156:43.77]That's good for us.
[156:44.79]Who cares?
[156:45.33]Fuck it.
[156:49.66]How do you get away from that?
[157:00.25]Triple kill!
[157:01.67]Dude, sometimes you just gotta change up the build.
[157:04.29]That's how you get... Uh-oh.
[157:06.49]Hold on.
[157:16.39]Hey, we changed up the build and now we're good to go.
[157:24.43]What is it?
[157:24.76]What is it?
[157:25.00]What is it?
[157:27.58]Get out of the way.
[157:28.08]This is mine.
[157:28.60]Don't touch it.
[157:32.82]Quilted vest.
[157:33.62]Ooh.
[157:35.22]And dexterity.
[157:40.42]You can have... Wait, my minions are going to get it.
[157:43.48]You can have these.
[157:44.76]My minions are going to have it.
[157:48.92]Let's divvy up the loot.
[157:50.69]You can have these and this.
[157:52.65]Face mask is blue.
[157:55.61]Cool.
[157:56.65]Oh, nice.
[157:57.89]I got a blue face mask.
[158:02.42]Alright.
[158:03.78]You ready?
[158:05.01]First unique ever.
[158:07.33]That's not true.
[158:08.83]I've played the game like three, like two or three months ago.
[158:14.57]This is why I play these games.
[158:15.81]It's the only reason why I love ARPGs.
[158:17.90]Ready?
[158:19.66]I'm ready.
[158:20.30]I'm ready.
[158:27.54]50 plus to 50 evasion.
[158:29.40]22 decks.
[158:31.82]10% increased movement speed when on full life.
[158:33.54]And 100% increased evasion rating when on full life.
[158:36.71]How'd this roll?
[158:39.41]How do I see the roll?
[158:41.75]Oh, I don't... On a controller, I have no idea.
[158:43.49]Oh, fuck!
[158:44.15]It rolled dog shit!
[158:45.79]It rolled minimum on everything!
[158:48.20]What the fuck?
[158:53.50]You gotta be kidding me.
[158:57.43]That sucks, but still, it's pretty cool.
[159:01.75]So 100% evasion rating, does that?
[159:04.86]Seems kind of a lot.
[159:07.98]There's a lot of decks.
[159:11.36]Dude, cool.
[159:11.86]Alright, how does it look?
[159:17.36]Nice.
[159:18.62]Hell yeah.
[159:20.56]So you move faster and you evade.
[159:25.43]So Dexterity gives you, what does it give you?
[159:30.82]Accuracy, evasion.
[159:32.56]Cool.
[159:39.76]Well, I'm happy about it.
[159:43.98]Sick.
[159:46.08]Anything else on the ground?
[159:47.15]Are we good?
[159:48.43]We're good.
[159:49.53]Loot get.
[159:51.03]Cool.
[160:01.48]loot epic loot dropping this is also one of the areas that got toned down a lot this used to just like just spawn an infinite amount of monsters in you and hunting grounds yeah the um
[160:34.95]Feels like it's pretty good so far.
[160:36.25]Yep.
[160:48.01]This map is a GPU melter.
[161:03.27]That's a lot of big boys.
[161:04.75]That is a lot of big.
[161:06.37]Hold on.
[161:07.45]OK.
[161:12.66]They're too big.
[161:16.38]Need an execute.
[161:20.95]What's a good periodic invincibility?
[161:31.63]Oh my God.
[161:33.45]What?
[161:34.03]Dude.
[161:35.99]What?
[161:37.17]Firm bracers.
[161:39.13]Those are for me.
[161:40.45]They might be.
[161:41.67]Those are for me.
[161:42.25]Give me those.
[161:43.05]Let's look at how cool they look.
[161:46.07]These look pretty sick, OK?
[161:48.85]Are you watching?
[161:49.33]You ready?
[161:50.39]Yeah.
[161:52.39]This will well made.
[161:57.05]I really know the actual streamer client.
[162:01.97]that's not a bad that's pretty good rolls on everything except for the last one that evasion rating though uh you can also use that because it's cold to attacks if you want to so would I be doing fire and would that does that work that way yeah yeah breeze build up okay what does it what does magnitude mean
[162:28.13]um I believe in chills instance it's just that you can get higher percentages of chills even more how much it slows them by oh multiplier it's a very good modifier oh yeah it'd do good
[162:50.58]It's like if I had that, I could probably freeze the bosses pretty consistently with frost bombs.
[162:58.86]Oh, it is doing a lot of damage.
[163:01.18]It's not even on.
[163:01.90]I just placebo affected myself.
[163:03.86]You can't even equip it.
[163:05.50]Oh my God, dude, this item is actually crazy.
[163:08.96]Just having it in your inventory, it's like a charm.
[163:11.74]It does so much.
[163:12.88]I just realized that.
[163:13.94]Oops.
[163:16.10]I actually had a placebo effect right there.
[163:17.88]I really thought I was doing boy damage.
[163:23.61]Now, should I always be putting the attribute points in the tree into decks?
[163:32.15]Yes, unless you really need other requirements.
[163:39.18]What the hell was that?
[163:40.30]Generally speaking.
[163:46.20]I kind of got a long way to go, but we're going.
[163:47.86]The goal is down here.
[163:56.99]I want elemental damage.
[164:01.08]Oh, it's your loot filter, right?
[164:06.08]What?
[164:06.26]What does it do?
[164:07.28]Oh, the sound.
[164:08.08]Okay.
[164:10.30]How do you get higher HP?
[164:12.52]I think it's just a plus to life stat.
[164:15.95]Strength gives life.
[164:17.43]Oh, strength does.
[164:18.03]Okay.
[164:47.59]Somebody said, hey, can you drop a divine orb?
[164:49.51]Do you have one?
[164:52.72]Uh, don't have one.
[164:58.08]It's a fun sound though.
[165:00.79]Alright, so we're going to... Oh, can you drop a mirror real quick?
[165:04.39]That's a really good one.
[165:06.43]I don't have a... What is a mirror?
[165:09.67]I don't worry about it.
[165:11.80]You're going to play Dog Food Simulator.
[165:14.38]I think you just made up a name of a game.
[165:24.30]Why would I need to simulate what I have for breakfast every morning?
[165:27.72]It's rude.
[165:40.24]I like this area, though.
[165:43.89]I like the pink and green.
[165:46.65]I'm going to have a garden just like this.
[165:53.30]You know, some people would cut this down.
[165:54.44]I don't think I would.
[166:14.66]Don't do it.
[166:15.32]Oh, that's a scary guy.
[166:16.45]He's kind of cute.
[166:30.09]They just added these like a day ago.
[166:31.79]The dexterity runes.
[166:32.97]I feel like that's all it's dropping.
[166:37.09]I feel like I'm picking up every single item.
[166:39.13]Oh, that might be a new spear.
[166:40.65]I think that's a higher item.
[166:42.77]Oh, shit, it is.
[166:47.56]15 to 27.
[166:48.36]Damn.
[166:51.58]48% physical damage.
[166:52.26]Oh, the other one has it too.
[166:55.06]It is better.
[167:00.26]I can't use it.
[167:00.90]I need 10 strength.
[167:05.42]I think your other one is slightly better because it has the attack speed.
[167:11.86]Attack speed on weapons is real good.
[167:16.20]Maybe I'll get the strength.
[167:21.64]No.
[167:27.03]I gotta go straight down here.
[167:30.97]And right there.
[167:31.79]Alright, cool.
[167:37.32]I think people... Let's try that again.
[167:42.74]People are asking about your loot filter.
[167:45.70]Yep.
[167:46.50]Is it... Are you giving this away?
[167:49.83]Uh, yeah, I can put the link in chat, but I'll probably get auto-modded because I'm not a mod in Jermis chat.
[167:55.21]Nope.
[167:59.01]So... Do you mind if we do a quick pee break?
[168:07.42]Uh, sure.
[168:07.80]Alright, let's do a BRB.
[168:13.60]I'll be right back.
[168:22.30]Okay.
[168:22.72]Yep.
[168:23.54]Gonna do a quick break.
[168:25.12]We'll come back.
[168:30.98]He's not muted, though.
[168:35.38]Yeah, I think he made this.
[168:37.42]He put a bunch of sounds in it.
[168:40.06]How's it going over there, chatters?
[168:42.36]If you really wanted it, tinyurl.com slash stirpoe2filter.
[168:47.86]I mean, I'm muted.
[168:48.44]He doesn't know.
[168:49.00]He can't hear me.
[168:52.51]but yeah I need to I don't know how it works in PeeWee 2 there's normally a way you can like link it to the website so it auto updates did I just did he you mute me unsupervised with Ster I could say anything I could do anything
[169:27.87]but ironically I do actually just want to convince you to play Path of Exile is the sad truth is it too late?
[169:44.62]I will fail no
[170:07.52]I can't I'm a filthy casual dude Jerma's doing just fine this guy plays like clean your clean your kitchen simulator where you get to go in with a toothbrush and like really clean the whole all around the sink he he beat the campaign and that was without me and then I hear I'm not too casual I can't
[170:29.97]And ignore when he said that the only thing I like in video games is action RPGs.
[170:35.86]I don't know what he was talking about.
[170:38.47]Because that's not true.
[171:03.21]tell us a story I you know the sad thing is I don't think I have any stories I don't know when I last left my house well no I went out this morning and I had a I had a taco that was that was sick like that's the whole story is I had a taco a taku I think they call them
[171:32.62]oh hell yeah dude green chili pork taco actually was very good am I okay uh yeah Esther have you ever seen a movie before I've seen a few seen a few

[172:30.01]You think Blood Witch is still bad?
[172:31.83]I think they were never bad.
[172:32.91]I think they're better than they were before because they added bleed support.
[172:37.72]That was a PeeWee question.
[172:38.88]We are gaming.
[172:46.91]These twerks on stream.
[172:48.27]Maybe one day.
[172:48.89]Maybe I'll have to like
[172:51.83]that's anything that's gonna get us both in fucking trouble are you no no I was just gonna say that maybe sometime I should come down to Vegas and get on your casting couch one of the things that probably could get us in trouble but okay I'm just you've already you've already been here I know but like it's weird to think that your stream setup is your couch now it's actually not it's actually not oh it moved
[173:21.22]Yeah, I'm back in the gamer room.
[173:24.84]Okay.
[173:27.30]Back in the gamer room.
[173:27.94]Come back.
[173:28.46]Actually, I saw on the news that it was like Las Vegas spending is down.
[173:33.61]There's like no one is going to Vegas.
[173:35.49]I was like, oh, I should go to Vegas.
[173:37.77]So it seems like a good time.
[173:39.81]Hey, you get maybe some good deals.
[173:42.49]Yeah.
[173:43.03]Get a hotel for like $13.
[173:45.39]Come on down.
[173:46.10]We'll do IRL checkers.
[173:47.20]Me versus you.
[173:49.42]You will not beat me in checkers.
[173:50.74]I think I will.
[173:51.96]That is like, checkers is kind of like an idiot's game.
[173:54.40]Like, you can win if you're like an idiot.
[173:56.04]If you do something, if you like jump over people and stuff.
[173:58.04]I'm so into checkers, I have the microtransaction set.
[174:01.48]It's like all different pictures of dogs on each piece.
[174:03.77]That's fine.
[174:04.35]I'm going to do the boom, boom, boom and just jump you like three times.
[174:07.67]Like, I can do it.
[174:09.49]I can probably beat you.
[174:10.69]You have no idea the 15 hit combo I'm going to set up.
[174:13.53]Alright, let me put my headphones back in.
[174:17.63]I can't hear you right now.
[174:19.71]Five big booms.
[174:27.68]Okay.
[174:29.04]So... How's everybody doing?
[174:32.04]You guys doing good?
[174:32.76]How you guys enjoying PoE?
[174:35.52]PoE 2.
[174:37.64]Game's currently on early access right now.
[174:39.74]It is 30 bucks.
[174:41.50]Game will be free when it launches.
[174:43.18]You can get it early access.
[174:45.10]What do you know?
[174:45.66]What's going on?
[174:46.32]Hey, Dawn of the Hunt.
[174:47.84]Update.
[174:50.15]hundred a hundred uniques you've seen two of them a hundred new uniques can you believe that unbelievable those two weren't those two weren't even of the new ones how many are actually in the game like jokes aside uh before the update um I don't know probably like another hundred or so
[175:16.82]So there's like 200 units.
[175:18.08]60-ish maybe?
[175:18.70]I don't really know.
[175:19.96]Yeah.
[175:20.58]Cool.
[175:22.38]Tell us the URL.
[175:23.86]The URL is currently pinned if you'd like more information.
[175:30.66]Okay.
[175:32.88]Are we ready?
[175:33.58]I got a water too.
[175:43.74]Ooh.
[175:44.26]Ooh.
[175:47.84]Oh, dude.
[175:48.24]Okay, so Holly and I, we had this thing happen where we had water.
[175:52.72]We wanted to make a water really cold, really fast.
[175:55.36]So I just put it in the freezer for a little bit.
[175:58.03]And it did the thing where it was really, really cold.
[176:02.87]So cold that we shook it a little.
[176:05.05]Even just moving it out of the freezer, it started to go solid.
[176:08.09]It did that cool science thing.
[176:13.21]Oh, yeah.
[176:13.70]No, I've never seen that.
[176:14.94]It was really cool, actually.
[176:19.22]dude that's physics super chilled I love how excited you were about it I mean I probably would be too I'm not so lucky we actually were like two seventh graders it was like what is oh my god look look what's happening oh wow is it cold no it is cold
[176:47.36]Where are we going?
[176:47.98]Simple joys.
[176:49.36]Anywhere.
[176:49.82]We're looking for three rituals.
[176:52.60]There's one now.
[176:58.36]So is it like is it really dead in Vegas?
[177:02.22]On the street?
[177:03.58]Yeah, it's just like spending is down across the board.
[177:07.22]A lot of people just aren't really want to not taking a vacation and obviously Vegas is.
[177:12.88]Almost solely based on the tourism industry so.
[177:24.02]Nice.
[177:27.19]Isn't it crazy that you have ice on demand in Vegas?
[177:32.07]That does seem like it shouldn't be a thing, right?
[177:38.24]And yet it is.
[177:38.96]Should I turn your settings down?
[177:41.24]What should I turn down?
[177:42.34]What do I got here?
[177:48.51]I think that's fine looking.
[177:51.46]Times 8?
[177:52.82]Lighting?
[177:53.14]Should I do what?
[177:53.66]Shadows?
[177:56.84]Sunshadows on low maybe?
[177:59.42]What are you running?
[178:00.06]How do you run the game?
[178:02.42]Do you run it on main things on high?
[178:05.82]I don't know.
[178:06.43]I have a lot of the things on low.
[178:12.63]FPS cap of 120.
[178:13.77]Yeah, I got a 120 FPS cap too.
[178:18.42]I think I have most things on low except for a texture quality.
[178:24.36]What do you do for texture filtering?
[178:25.62]Times four?
[178:26.00]Texture filter times two.
[178:30.41]Yeah, I got DLS.
[178:31.93]I want to keep it on performance.
[178:33.41]I think it adds a little.
[178:34.27]How does it look on performance?
[178:36.03]I think it looks alright.
[178:40.59]I think it looks good.
[178:46.98]Having some trubs?
[178:48.54]no it's just when when we do the giant explosions uh when there's like four of them at the same time sometimes too it's that same thing with path of exile where I mean by now maybe it wouldn't be happening that it loads the shaders for like explosions when they happen for real for the first time so I think people might be seeing that but otherwise I don't know it's like if a new enemy uses a new spell sometimes it can be pretty bad about that gotta load it into shaders
[179:20.53]When did shaders start happening?
[179:21.83]I feel like as a young gamer, they just crept up on us.
[179:24.41]Every game you open now is like caching shaders for an hour.
[179:27.53]I don't know.
[179:29.57]Yeah, I think that's a pretty recent phenomenon.
[179:42.73]Ready to begin the ritual?
[179:43.61]Wait, is that it wasn't happening?
[179:47.08]I don't remember that happening.
[179:48.04]They've always been like there's always obviously been shaders.
[179:51.36]That's a thing, but I feel like recently.
[179:54.08]I think games have made like a bigger show of them.
[179:58.68]We're like oh launching compiling shaders for the first time with like a percentage bar we never had before.
[180:03.04]This is true.
[180:10.20]Well, you know, I'll turn shadows down.
[180:13.53]I miss when games were just two colors.
[180:16.01]They were just black and white.
[180:18.25]Now we have like a gray in between.
[180:19.83]If it's going to increase my load time, I just want it two colors.
[180:24.59]Let's do medium lights.
[180:27.94]Water detail.
[180:28.92]We can put that down probably.
[180:30.34]120 is fine.
[180:32.92]Dynamic culling.
[180:33.70]That means it will kill the monsters for me.
[180:37.18]Multithreading is fine.
[180:38.84]Yeah, I checked on these before.
[180:40.78]Dynamic culling is pretty good.
[180:45.06]What does it do?
[180:47.78]So when there's like way too many particles on the screen, it just like reduces some of them.
[180:53.00]So you keep your FPS.
[181:00.37]Oh shit, hold on.
[181:03.11]Performance, let's do balanced is fine.
[181:07.69]Medium lights, maybe it's lights.
[181:09.95]Water, put on water low.
[181:11.39]We don't need water.
[181:12.21]We don't need water in our game.
[181:18.45]Oh, level 4.
[181:22.24]What can I get with a level 4?
[181:23.00]I think I'm just going to stick with explosive spear.
[181:30.62]Why not?
[181:31.96]Seems to be working pretty well.
[181:34.58]Do it up.
[181:40.33]I could get lightning spear.
[181:41.95]Yeah, you didn't use lightning spear yet.
[181:43.83]No, I'm going to try it.
[181:46.13]I don't have any... I think Spear gets very good once you have level 2 support gems.
[181:49.81]Oh my god.
[182:03.18]You busy?
[182:03.68]I'm in my menu.
[182:18.77]It looks really cool.
[182:19.49]You're trying to fight these cultist warriors.
[182:23.34]It looks cool.
[182:25.98]I usually love lightning spells like that.
[182:30.41]The first character I played in POE 2 was the.
[182:34.95]Electric ball, so as far as whatever.
[182:39.09]um lightning spear with the frenzy charge and later on the uh the vault support it shoots like the entire screen is just lightning okay it's not like a meme that you say that you always do that you always do like the ball lightning spells
[183:02.21]Isn't there?
[183:02.87]Am I crazy?
[183:03.57]Yeah, there is.
[183:06.11]There is.
[183:07.05]My favorite kind of wizard is ball lightning.
[183:10.10]He did it.
[183:10.42]He said the thing.
[183:15.08]I explained this to you once, but I also explained to you how it's like an ancient meme from like six years ago in an obscure game that no one knows what I'm talking about anymore.
[183:29.02]I'm sure you have plenty of those like 10 year old jokes that only at this point you actually know what you're talking about that you still say.
[183:35.33]Yeah, kind of.
[183:37.01]Yeah, that's ball lightning is my favorite wizard for me.
[183:40.29]And you're realistically you're only saying it for five people in a chat.
[183:44.46]Yeah, and it's also not even true.
[183:47.24]Oh, you just made this up.
[183:49.14]No, like the story is true, but ball lightning is not my favorite wizard.
[183:57.75]I just like to talk about stuff that I know.
[184:01.13]Ooh, I want that.
[184:05.02]Sometimes I just bring up a video I watched.
[184:07.34]I don't even talk about what the video was.
[184:08.88]I just say it.
[184:09.44]And I'll look at the chat and there'll be maybe three or four people going by.
[184:16.20]We'll just say, be like, oh, I've seen that YouTube video.
[184:18.68]My God, that was for you.
[184:22.01]I don't even say it's what.
[184:24.41]And that's what tricks you into thinking everyone gets what you're saying and you keep saying it.
[184:31.77]And here I am a decade later saying ball lightning is my favorite wizard.
[184:41.80]Oh yeah, like they get it.
[184:42.91]They remember that they don't remember that.
[184:45.83]Somebody does.
[184:52.25]I remember uh so we're gonna go kill the king in the mist because he wants to exist and we don't like that about him cool did the lore here go so hard hey man you just point me in a direction I'm just gonna throw spears at him I don't care I'm just hanging out
[185:21.49]Alright.
[185:33.88]Can I put points in first before we do this?
[185:36.42]Sure.
[185:37.54]Thank you.
[185:42.02]You better put the right ones in.
[185:44.08]I am judging you.
[185:44.96]Did I do it wrong?
[185:47.36]I am judging.
[185:48.18]I did strengthen Dex.
[185:51.46]Wait.
[185:53.02]Sorry.
[185:54.60]I didn't hit the confirm button.
[186:01.70]Nah, we're good.
[186:02.40]Okay.
[186:02.98]Gotta go all the way down here.
[186:04.02]Alright.
[186:07.69]Are those ones right next to what you just passed by are pretty good on the left?
[186:10.92]There's some like melee or projectile if you did either.
[186:14.54]I can put these on now.
[186:17.08]Oh, can I have those gloves?
[186:18.58]You want these actually?
[186:19.60]No, you use them.
[186:21.20]No, you can take them if you want.
[186:22.90]Okay.
[186:24.96]I wanted to try and go cold wizard.
[186:27.83]I don't have the decks to wear them.
[186:30.99]I will later.
[186:31.71]I will one day.
[186:32.71]I'll put them on.
[186:36.72]Better than the like gray pieces of shit that I had on.
[186:48.86]Harry.
[186:50.38]So what was your favorite Path of Exile one league?
[186:53.78]Um, the one.
[186:56.15]Where it was kind of like a roguelike.
[187:03.18]And that's just the first sentence that I remember you telling me.
[187:08.42]That is sort of the trial of Sekima that you did in this game.
[187:12.43]Actually, I like those actually.
[187:13.43]They're fun.
[187:22.01]Decent pick.
[187:24.97]I like that one better than the other one.
[187:26.14]What was the other one called?
[187:28.14]Ultimatum.
[187:28.98]Trial of Chaos.
[187:29.64]Yeah.
[187:39.58]I'm a big Sentinel fan myself.
[187:49.24]I'm talking to no one.
[187:51.48]You're talking to me.
[187:52.38]I'm listening.
[187:53.08]I mean, I'm like starting a conversation where you're like, you know, the other person has no idea what you're talking about.
[187:59.53]I mean, I don't know.
[188:00.21]Yeah, I don't, but I'm listening.
[188:01.97]I'm just kind of nodding my head.
[188:05.35]That's good.
[188:17.02]What kind of smoke in this guy?
[188:17.98]Kind of are.
[188:21.36]Oh no, phase two.
[188:27.21]Out.
[188:32.39]I love the voice acting.
[188:36.63]Oh fuck, I was too busy listening to the voice acting.
[188:38.89]Can you get me?
[188:48.79]I don't.
[188:49.39]Hold on.
[188:50.47]Hold on.
[188:53.95]For me, PeeWee One is one of the most like quotable games of all time.
[189:04.52]Good.
[189:04.66]Drag him over there.
[189:05.24]Nameless King's kinda cute.
[189:10.01]You are so good.
[189:11.35]You're so good.
[189:11.97]You're almost there.
[189:12.47]Almost there.
[189:14.77]Yes!
[189:16.44]Nice work.
[189:18.00]Oh no, oh no.
[189:19.88]Now it's up to me.
[189:21.82]You instantly died.
[189:23.34]I don't know.
[189:23.74]I saw some weird effect.
[189:25.36]I can't move.
[189:25.80]I'm trapped.
[189:27.24]How do I get out?
[189:38.61]We're definitely dead here.
[189:39.35]By the way, there's no way I'm going to do this.
[189:42.65]You got this.
[189:45.48]he's chilling on the other side good okay any gas alright throwing out the gas
[190:21.20]Mike, can I do anything to get out of this or am I just trapped?
[190:25.04]It's fairly obtuse that the red one, I forget every time, the red one you have to keep moving.
[190:33.03]No, the red one you have to stop and then there's a purple circle under you where you have to stand still, otherwise it traps you.
[190:40.22]He plays red light, green light.
[190:46.06]I think we just did a darn good job.
[190:49.60]Big reward on this guy.
[190:53.14]What does it do?
[190:56.63]The spirit gem.
[190:58.59]Oh, yeah.
[190:58.93]You have to activate this, right?
[191:01.37]And you can... That's how you get summons and everything?
[191:04.41]Yeah, all of your passive abilities.
[191:08.19]You will probably want... You probably want this.
[191:10.81]Do you want this?
[191:13.05]I have an amulet.
[191:14.49]Oh, cool.
[191:15.61]Put it on.
[191:19.61]I got so much crap here.
[191:20.99]Finally, a better flask.
[191:24.65]Finally, a better mana flask.
[191:26.52]Good.
[191:28.36]Give me the spirit.
[191:31.34]Okay, here we go.
[191:33.58]Herald of Thunder, Wind Dancer, or Herald of Blood.
[191:41.54]Actually, I thought Blight League was pretty good from start to finish.
[191:47.09]What chatter did you just read?
[191:48.23]That was from me, from my own brain.
[191:59.47]Okay, while I have to periodically grant stages of a buff that gives you more evasion.
[192:02.97]Okay, Herald of Thunder.
[192:07.44]Killing shocked enemies with a non-herald attack.
[192:12.00]It will cause subsequent attackers to release lightning.
[192:16.60]though I would want this if I was herald of blood um also you could look at all gems and herald of ash if you want to keep doing fire spear if you're really into the explosion spear but that really is one of the only fire spear skills or just wind dancer is good that's crossbow though
[192:45.83]which is uh herald of ashes crossbow um it's not you can use it with any weapon I can yeah it's just in the crossbow category whoa I actually did I don't I did not know that until you just told me got him yeah so when you open up the skill panel there you can look at all gems like you can get spells or whatever you want to get from any class
[193:11.71]That's also why the game has... If you put a crossbow on your secondary, it'll switch to your crossbow to do crossbow skills.
[193:19.15]I need 25 strength.
[193:20.97]I only have 12.
[193:21.51]Am I going to get 10, 15 strength in the next 10 lows?
[193:34.90]We have some of those strength runes.
[193:37.16]I'm doing it.
[193:38.44]I'll get it when I have strength.
[193:40.40]here take take the rune then alright I need a town run for sure also if you change a dex node to a strength node it's like half cost to respec and also check the altar if it has a reward for you it's kind of ton of shit this thing's loaded up with stuff yeah but they cost tribute should I spend it on this yeah
[194:09.34]I mean, those boots are pretty good.
[194:13.02]They do got movement speed on them.
[194:14.92]Oh, only the instance owner can purchase favors.
[194:20.13]Or was that me?
[194:20.75]I think that's you.
[194:21.19]Oh, well then take the boots.
[194:26.13]Thank you.
[194:32.82]See how instantly I just got that.
[194:36.16]He's so fast.
[194:40.59]I need a better shield.
[194:41.41]This thing kind of sucks.
[194:43.59]Let's do a town run.
[194:44.93]Yeah.
[194:45.73]I'm going in the frog.
[194:47.59]You can check the vendors.
[194:52.45]And maybe they sell something with plus strength on it too.
[194:57.98]Yeah, tomorrow night's going to be an itchy Ohara night.
[195:02.40]It's been a two or three week cool down.
[195:04.04]It's been long enough.
[195:12.64]can I watch yeah you found the ring oh hey champ trade me don't mind me I want to see the cutscene I don't know how to ask this of you but I was forced to leave behind something of great importance to me when it's in my
[195:37.41]How long has it been?
[195:40.24]I was hunted.
[195:41.12]I love this voice.
[195:42.54]The Count bestowed something that is beyond dangerous.
[195:48.32]It will cause sickness, then madness.
[195:54.41]It can still be contained.
[195:57.37]We must put the seed back.
[195:59.89]Put the seed back.
[196:01.31]Yes.
[196:04.31]OK, identify my items and.
[196:10.17]Let's dump a bunch of stuff.
[196:12.53]Alright, I got a regal orb.
[196:15.13]If you don't know regal orbs, these are cool.
[196:17.45]This will take a magic item.
[196:19.86]And we'll just make it a rare.
[196:21.28]These are worth a lot.
[196:26.98]I could turn this into a rare if I wanted to.
[196:29.56]That's kind of cool.
[196:31.90]But I'm going to never use that ever.
[196:34.50]I'm going to have a stack of 100 of them.
[196:37.06]And then sell them on the market for some shitty ring that an alt is going to use.
[196:43.05]That's how it works.
[196:48.11]Yeah, they're not worth that much.
[196:55.46]Did you need any other support gems or are you good?
[196:58.58]uh I'm good I bought stuff from the vendor for you I went to town and I picked up a couple of things I think you're gonna look cute and you vendored for me yeah if you want to see these you'd have to trade me oh uh I got these thigh highs with 10 movement speed and strength where are they uh trade me says you're busy oh do it again
[197:25.63]Uh... Oh, I really hate to say it, but my outfit is, like, actually better.
[197:42.40]Yeah, but you can't wear that because I... Yeah, but... Yeah, I guess I'm giving you strength boots so you can wear boots.
[197:49.26]I, uh, those... That's very helpful.
[197:51.33]I appreciate it.
[197:52.41]Please wear these.
[197:53.35]I'm... Dude, I got the grip of winter.
[197:56.93]Please.
[197:59.73]I don't need those.
[198:00.57]You just... How much money did you spend? $700,000.
[198:08.81]You wouldn't bought me like old fall fashion, dude.
[198:11.43]Come on.
[198:12.49]Oh, come on.
[198:13.94]I got my summer fit on right now.
[198:21.12]I do appreciate it, bro.
[198:21.76]String bikini of the exalted, imbued by God itself.
[198:28.61]Well, I guess I have to wear it.
[198:29.99]It does.
[198:30.51]It does fit my build.
[198:31.99]This hooded one.
[198:34.61]Yes.
[198:35.99]That'll be useful.
[198:40.18]Alright, so you're saying that this thing.
[198:42.90]Is 1527 versus 1121 damage.
[198:46.55]I lose 6% attack speed.
[198:48.51]I don't think that really is that big of a deal.
[198:53.25]I think I want the base damage.
[198:55.17]It is a big deal.
[198:57.79]6% attack speed.
[198:58.35]That's like instead of 12 well because the base attack speed on a weapon.
[199:04.89]is increased by your attack speed nose on the passive tree oh so it's kind of like the higher the base it gets exponentially more good so it's not just like a one two three versus one two three like you couldn't even tell the difference and I I did do it faster you might not be able to tell the difference but it will be more dps okay stick to the care
[199:35.87]I don't know if you have like a metronome going on the side of your desk while you're attacking.
[199:42.06]Oh, dude, you want this?
[199:43.84]You told me this is like good.
[199:47.72]What?
[199:49.04]Here.
[199:51.77]I can't select you.
[199:52.55]I have controller.
[199:53.27]You have to like move over here.
[199:54.19]Remember you told me to keep this?
[199:59.39]Because you could turn it into a rare.
[200:01.23]Yeah.
[200:11.36]Yeah, that's from that's from last fall.
[200:21.99]Sure, fine.
[200:27.85]Let's throw it away.
[200:29.97]No, no, it's OK.
[200:30.61]I'll throw it away.
[200:33.15]Well, no, no, no, no.
[200:34.25]I'll throw it away.
[200:34.97]I'll throw it in the trash.
[200:35.61]I'll throw it in the trash.
[200:37.09]Return it.
[200:37.69]You're just creating waste.
[200:38.89]Yeah, I'll throw it in the trash.
[200:39.91]Thank you.
[200:40.37]Okay.
[200:41.19]Oh, it's useless.
[200:41.99]I'll throw it away.
[200:42.43]Okay.
[200:45.79]Alright.
[200:46.21]No, fine.
[200:46.87]Do you have a belt yet?
[200:50.68]Yes.
[200:50.86]Okay.
[200:51.00]Cold resistance is tough in this game.
[201:03.59]What is that thing flying around?
[201:04.63]Is this something like a cat?
[201:07.65]What's this flying cat?
[201:09.57]Yeah, they got a cat.
[201:13.37]Cool.
[201:17.60]Haunted by cat.
[201:22.98]OK.
[201:24.90]We still have a couple of these other little side things, but.
[201:30.93]I think we're good.
[201:33.65]uh the next thing on the list is you could do uh search for una's loot or find the entrance to the village uh we have to go back to hunting grounds and do crowbell for +2 skill points oh damn that's right okay yeah let's go back
[202:03.53]If you buy cosmetics, do you put them on any character on your account?
[202:06.91]Oh, no, those aren't reset.
[202:08.51]Yeah.
[202:10.21]All of cosmetics and everything you buy in PoE 2 also works in PoE 1.
[202:14.70]Really?
[202:15.80]Yep.
[202:19.34]So, like, if you...
[202:21.86]uh you get the early access for 30 duelers it gives you microtransaction coins in the game equal to the 30 dollars and then I would recommend you get stash tabs and then they also carry over you get those same like the unique tab you were showing you would also get in poe one and also too uh the warrior got a new ascendancy called the smith of kitava that's true mercenary got another ascendancy as well the tactician
[202:51.72]Yep.
[202:53.10]And that is one of an absolute smorgasbord of new content that you could experience yourself.
[203:07.56]He's not lying.
[203:09.50]You could.
[203:10.20]That's just factually true.
[203:18.18]I love this guy.
[203:18.78]It's funny.
[203:19.10]He just runs around.
[203:21.82]Did I just get locked out?
[203:23.14]Oh.
[203:27.39]He really should just lock the door.
[203:28.63]We wouldn't be able to do anything.
[203:32.41]Harry.
[203:36.15]I got it, but he smushed me.
[203:39.19]Do not get smushed.
[203:56.10]He's trying to call someone on the telephone.
[203:58.21]He's trying to phone a friend.
[204:00.79]Get him.
[204:01.33]Somebody said, how many uniques do you think they added?
[204:04.15]We can count them, actually.
[204:05.59]We'll start at one.
[204:07.19]One, two, three, four.
[204:10.56]What just happened?
[204:12.58]five six oh oh no seven eight and you think I could probably stop there with a major update like this you're probably thinking like oh like eight uniques that that sounds pretty good nine ten we're going ten more than ten uniques have been added in the dawn of the hunt would you believe it if I told you that more than 20 uniques have been added to dawn of the hunt we're not going to stop there what what
[204:41.04]I'm reacting to you.
[204:42.94]Oh, oh, oh.
[204:47.84]If you call now, we'll double the amount of uniques.
[204:52.34]That gets us to 40 unique, Ster.
[204:55.76]We're getting a little crazy here, Ster.
[204:57.72]That's a few too many for me.
[205:01.04]What are you going to do with all these uniques?
[205:03.42]I'm going to equip them on make unique characters.
[205:05.54]Now, Ster.
[205:07.35]If I were to tell you that
[205:10.62]There were 50 new uniques in Path of Exile 2, Dawn of the Hunt.
[205:14.50]What would you say to that?
[205:16.28]I'd say that sounds like a whole lot of uniques, but I feel like you're setting up some sort of anchoring situation where I'm going to really expect that there's only 50.
[205:24.99]Go ahead and take this calculator.
[205:28.73]Take this calculator out right now.
[205:29.99]I want you to type in 5-0.
[205:30.95]There you go, 50.
[205:31.31]This is a regular calculator.
[205:33.52]There's no strings, nothing.
[205:35.18]So normal calculator, put 50 in there.
[205:37.55]I want you to go ahead and hit the times two button.
[205:40.05]Times two right there on the top right of the calculator.
[205:42.29]Yes.
[205:42.99]What do you get there?
[205:43.61]Times two.
[205:46.15]Hold on.
[205:47.68]A hundred.
[205:49.22]One hundred new uniques in Dawn of the Hunt Path of Exile 2's early access update.
[205:57.88]You did the math yourself.
[206:00.80]I didn't believe it until I put the numbers in.
[206:08.54]And, and... Hey, I'll throw in 20 support gems.
[206:14.93]I mean, hold on.
[206:15.95]I mean, I'll throw in 20 new active skills for the huntress.
[206:21.67]I thought you were going to have me multiply by four.
[206:24.57]Or five.
[206:25.31]Take this calculator.
[206:26.75]Alright, put 20 into that calculator.
[206:28.53]Can you do times four?
[206:30.27]I need a calculator to understand this game.
[206:32.31]We're going to Ogma Farm.
[206:37.98]Alright, we'll go to Ogham Farm.
[206:43.02]Need to take this to Shark Tank?
[206:44.32]I agree.
[206:46.34]I think you could sell them anything.
[206:51.45]So you think I'm going to make you $100,000?
[206:53.23]Now take this calculator.
[206:55.83]Those other games that only add five or six unique... That's not going to happen here.
[207:05.01]Hey, let me show you this, Ster.
[207:05.99]You see the boots I have on right here?
[207:07.89]You see these gloves I have on?
[207:10.51]Um, yes.
[207:11.95]And then I'm standing there with these gloves actually on.
[207:16.10]I have them physically on.
[207:17.48]Like, in the video.
[207:19.84]Uh-huh.
[207:21.14]And I just start smashing shit with them.
[207:23.74]Just like, I just see 48% increased evasion rating.
[207:26.86]This is just one of the new uniques you can pick up here.
[207:29.00]Ster, I'd like you to try to attack me.
[207:30.64]Ster, punch me in the face as hard as you can.
[207:33.97]Do it as hard as you can.
[207:38.10]Okay.
[207:38.60]Let's see.
[207:39.42]It hit me in the mouth.
[207:40.88]That got me right in the teeth.
[207:42.04]Hold on.
[207:42.30]Stop, stop, stop.
[207:43.22]Stop, stop, stop.
[207:43.94]You got me in the mouth.
[207:44.54]It's 48%.
[207:44.72]It's not 100%.
[207:45.08]Ow.
[207:45.14]Okay.
[207:45.30]Try it again.
[207:45.60]Throw one.
[207:53.46]Boom!
[207:53.82]Dodged it right there.
[207:55.74]My teeth are fucking killing me.
[207:58.02]I have to go to the dentist.
[207:59.36]These are pushed in all the way up in my mouth.
[208:03.15]48% evasion rating.
[208:03.93]Uh, ow.
[208:07.09]I've lost track of the bit.
[208:10.67]I just know he said, punch me in the face.
[208:12.92]And I'd been waiting.
[208:15.88]Because it was only 48%.
[208:17.10]That doesn't mean... I didn't get the roll.
[208:21.91]I didn't get the... It didn't proc.
[208:25.73]Get it?
[208:27.35]Thank you.
[208:28.15]Thank you.
[208:28.67]Thank you.
[208:35.76]No, I get it now.
[208:37.16]Because of the...
[208:42.98]The bits.
[208:44.16]I mean, and that's just math.
[208:46.00]That's just math.
[208:49.42]50 times 2 is 100.
[208:50.08]I mean, that's just math.
[208:59.19]Are you doing okay?
[208:59.87]I'm just having fun.
[209:02.59]Are you not having fun right now?
[209:03.75]I'm having fun.
[209:05.01]I'm having fun.
[209:07.45]Playing my baby game with my bestie.
[209:10.08]I mean, this is like your favorite video game franchise ever.
[209:13.62]You must be so happy.
[209:19.70]I like when the monster drops loot.
[209:22.12]But then when it's not the right roll, then I get punched in the face.
[209:25.62]That's what I've learned.
[209:29.60]It's so funny this can all boil really down to.
[209:31.89]I like when the shiny color hits the ground.
[209:39.52]I mean, I like casting spells.
[209:42.59]Yeah, that's fun too.
[209:45.43]I like a good spell animation.
[209:47.61]You need a level 4?
[209:48.31]That's a spirit gem.
[209:51.49]Oh yeah, I don't want that.
[209:52.47]I could use it.
[209:55.84]Take it.
[210:04.81]We get our skill points book we did.
[210:10.43]alright keep going uh I'm gonna do strength let's try wait what are these more evasion I finally unlocked a jewel slot I need a jewel uh that'll be a while it could be a minute
[210:44.94]There's money over here.
[210:47.79]Six gold.
[210:49.07]You didn't pick it up.
[210:54.49]Gold on table in Riften.
[210:56.59]That's another ball lightning wizard story.
[210:58.43]Skyrim, I remember that.
[210:59.91]You said that in Skyrim.
[211:01.85]I did say that in Skyrim.
[211:03.73]That's an absolute classic banger.
[211:17.16]I'll be on my deathbed thinking about the gold that I left on the table in Riften and how I don't have it.
[211:24.60]Ooh, I want that.
[211:28.01]Level four.
[211:31.15]I feel like I'm not using this anymore.
[211:33.17]I'm not doing the parries very much anymore.
[211:35.65]I've noticed.
[211:37.67]I'm kind of just throwing spears.
[211:39.39]I really should do more of this.
[211:47.84]uh it ends up being a bit more of like a boss thing when you have uh the culling strike I think we the loot is over here I think I see it two skill points for this as well back to back you can believe it yeah b2b
[212:16.21]Get it?
[212:16.47]Do you get it?
[212:17.17]Do you get that it's loot?
[212:19.19]Do you get that it's a loot?
[212:21.54]In a loot game, do you get it?
[212:22.72]You see how that's like a pun?
[212:26.42]Alright, how low can you do that and still be understandable?
[212:29.38]You have to try really hard to speak really slowly and raise your voice a little so we can actually understand you.
[212:36.98]Alright, stop, stop, stop, stop, stop.
[212:43.96]You need to start talking like this.
[212:47.04]No, it's not working.
[212:49.68]You sound like some of the monsters in the game.
[213:06.64]I was talking really high I was trying my best oh hold on I can't
[213:34.60]oh he's talking still hold on oh I was trying to make you poop with the brown noise sorry I got someone I know I got someone you're just not going to see evidence of it because they had to leave chat smithing hammer smooth oh yes
[214:04.68]The ancient smoothing hammer.
[214:07.31]It's a big map too.
[214:13.95]I mean, have you ever been on a farm?
[214:16.53]Once or twice.
[214:19.66]I'm way too much of a city boy though.
[214:21.80]Have you ever been on a farm?
[214:26.70]No, no, no, no, no.
[214:27.34]Stop.
[214:27.74]If you're going to do that, you at least have to try to talk low.
[214:33.52]Oh.
[214:34.96]I was told to go the other way.
[214:38.96]Get it to a position where you're talking really low.
[214:41.81]Like, go like this.
[214:46.47]No, no, no.
[214:47.57]Stop being gravelly.
[214:48.53]Relax.
[214:54.89]No, you need to relax.
[214:57.05]You're like screeching.
[214:58.09]What do you mean relax?
[214:59.13]I'm so relaxed.
[215:00.37]I'm so relaxed.
[215:04.07]Are you going like this?
[215:05.91]I am going like this.
[215:19.77]It's like if a fucking like four month old had a one of those like mega mind brains and you were able to talk.
[215:37.80]True.
[215:43.00]I think I'm going to be a bit of a mosquito streamer.
[215:51.69]Oh, this is down on fire.
[215:53.17]We are about to fight my, one of my favorite bosses in the game.
[215:57.83]Really?
[215:58.11]Let's turn the graphics down for this.
[215:59.71]Why is it your favorite?
[216:03.28]I just love this one.
[216:07.04]Anything particular about it?
[216:08.34]I think it's cool.
[216:11.74]And don't spoil it.
[216:15.13]Okay.
[216:16.95]You're doing great.
[216:19.51]Thanks.
[216:21.91]Oh, thanks, Pa.
[216:24.73]Sorry about the high pitch voice bit.
[216:29.98]Oops.
[216:31.82]I probably shouldn't have done that during the game.
[216:34.84]That was probably a bad idea.
[216:37.84]Oh, don't you switch the Vulcan.
[216:39.82]Why?
[216:40.06]I didn't mean to.
[216:42.18]I didn't mean to.
[216:45.46]I'm coming back.
[216:46.06]Hold on.
[216:46.42]I'm almost there.
[216:48.00]I'm coming back.
[216:49.25]Oops.
[216:49.57]That's not what I meant.
[216:52.34]Okay.
[216:53.22]Uh, that was the wrong button.
[216:54.20]I mean, hold on.
[216:54.74]I'm coming back.
[216:55.24]I'm coming, I'm coming, I'm coming.
[216:59.67]Somebody said to switch to Vulkan.
[217:00.77]They said it was cool.
[217:02.53]Uh, yeah.
[217:03.37]No, I tried to... I tried to prevent this earlier.
[217:13.84]You got Vulkan 1 guide.
[217:15.36]I'm just curious.
[217:18.70]I want to try it.
[217:20.08]Nobody said it was cool.
[217:22.60]Yeah, they did.
[217:23.12]They said, hey, dude, try Vulcan.
[217:24.34]It's cool.
[217:26.92]All the cool kids are doing it.
[217:34.57]Okay, hold on.
[217:35.33]Hold on.
[217:42.91]Come on, kid.
[217:43.59]Everyone's doing it.
[217:44.75]Smoke up.
[217:47.59]Alright, let me try Vulcan.
[217:48.63]I want to try it.
[217:49.15]It seems like it's got a cool name.
[217:51.59]It does have a cool name.
[217:56.86]Alright, coming back.
[218:01.16]Why?
[218:01.40]My name is Measley Worm.
[218:06.62]Is your memory... You have a two-hour limit?
[218:08.65]Three-hour limit?
[218:10.65]Like...
[218:17.66]I made it in 10 seconds because of the title of the stream.
[218:21.29]We had a conversation about it.
[218:22.87]I told you to do it.
[218:24.51]You thought it was funny.
[218:25.41]You know how much shit has happened in the last three and a half hours?
[218:30.13]Yeah.
[218:35.92]Let's check out this Vulcan.
[218:36.98]Are we still in a party?
[218:42.82]Yeah.
[218:47.86]Uh, this is like beautiful.
[218:58.03]OK, let's go.
[218:58.83]This ends now.
[219:09.88]Were you holding up a picture of me when you said that or?
[219:16.80]You just popped my earbuds out of my ear.
[219:23.16]Nice.
[219:38.03]My shaders got a loaded.
[219:39.01]I just turned on a new like graphics renderer.
[219:42.69]It resets all the shaders when you switch.
[219:44.81]So yeah, looks I think it looks good.
[219:52.61]POE.
[219:54.29]Yeah, but is it cool?
[219:56.25]Is it hip?
[219:58.21]Is it with it?
[220:02.53]You need a new CPU.
[220:03.57]I need a new everything.
[220:06.32]39 he probably can go on whatever.
[220:15.74]New buckler!
[220:17.06]Actually, I want that.
[220:18.38]What?
[220:21.55]And a regal?
[220:25.31]More evasion, more dex.
[220:27.29]Hold resist, fire resist.
[220:31.83]Uh, thank you.
[220:33.55]Doesn't it make it better when it makes the noise when it drops?
[220:38.28]We like sound effects over here.
[220:39.90]I have to put the item filter volume at max in the settings.
[220:53.42]It's supposed to hurt.
[220:56.84]I like how it gives you a chance to get the item that dropped for you, but I just get it anyways.
[221:03.50]You can change that setting in the party options.
[221:06.05]I think it's fine.
[221:09.21]Just saying.
[221:09.73]I'm just, you know... Yeah, you know how it is.
[221:14.89]It's just my hands in my pockets and I'm kind of smirking like, you know...
[221:34.11]It's what it is.
[221:37.99]Mine.
[221:39.76]Dave, do you actually need that or we need to discuss every single thing that drops on the ground?
[221:44.10]We have to discuss it.
[221:44.72]I do need it.

[222:06.11]Orb of Augmentation.
[222:07.07]Do you need that?
[222:08.53]You know what's funny, though, about this bit is this is how we played Diablo 3 together.
[222:20.40]It was very hard.
[222:21.64]It was very difficult.
[222:23.32]It took a very long time.
[222:29.90]Wrapped Sandals.

[222:40.17]Can we roll for it?
[222:42.27]Sure.
[222:50.96]That's a deep... I have a question.
[222:55.96]I have an ascendancy question.
[222:58.02]Yes.
[222:58.82]So they've added three new ascendancies in the Dawn of the Hump update.
[223:02.23]Five ascendancies.
[223:03.68]five new ascendancies in the Dawn of the Hun update.
[223:06.87]Yep.
[223:08.86]How many ascendancies are each class?
[223:11.86]Are we talking about
[223:14.02]oh god they still have so many to add it looks like on the character select screen it looks like there's a lot of places for some more um is not an ascendancy oh right there's a class that gets three ascendancies okay sorry okay where's my script oh I actually spilled water everywhere that's not even a joke hopefully didn't get it this is bad actually
[223:40.29]I tried to do a shuffle the papers bit and it was a bottle of water that I tried to make sound effects with.
[223:46.21]That was a stupid idea.
[223:49.63]I'm going back to town.
[223:51.03]No, no, no, no, no.

[224:17.91]Can you do it?
[224:19.27]You know what?
[224:19.81]I will take that bet.

[224:22.03]You can't go in this portal and do the singular one thing.
[224:28.12]Yes, I... Stop.
[224:30.20]I'm busy.
[224:32.47]That's what's making it even harder.

[231:03.88]It's messed up.
[231:04.88]Fucked up.

[231:09.38]They probably said it.
[231:12.26]This is wicked fucked up.
[231:13.32]People are gonna think this is wicked fucked up.
[231:15.35]I think they probably said that.

[232:39.60]You guys don't understand.
[232:41.70]When I go like this, it goes and it does a ton of damage.
[232:46.88]I don't think you're seeing it.
[232:51.65]Oh, check this out.

[233:31.32]You laughed when the guy got executed.
[233:33.18]The moment his head came off, you laughed like he told a joke.
[233:37.49]No, it was because it was loading and it didn't load.
[233:41.25]You didn't watch my stream.
[233:46.67]I laughed because I changed the graphics thing.
[233:51.79]New instance.
[233:52.31]Do I have to make a new instance?
[233:58.31]You held... I don't know how a controller does it now.
[234:01.23]just enter do whatever okay I'll figure it out hey dude just want to let you know brushing your teeth is the only time that you clean your skeleton weird um
[234:35.17]I can think of a few other times I cleaned my bone.
[234:46.17]Alright.
[234:46.77]I like these enemies.
[234:51.14]Gargoyles.
[234:57.34]They're pretty cute.
[234:59.64]We got to get the Count Goonar.
[235:03.18]What?
[235:07.74]We're so close to the end.
[235:09.10]Path of Exile.
[235:23.49]I've had chicken or whatever.
[235:26.15]I don't know.
[235:26.58]That's not my bit.
[235:29.30]Are you implying that that's mine?
[235:30.46]No, it's Vinny's.
[235:36.06]What?
[235:36.68]I didn't commit.
[235:39.52]Never mind.
[235:40.30]Never mind.
[235:41.12]Never mind.
[235:41.64]Never mind.
[235:42.30]Have a chicken?
[235:43.59]Who says have a chicken?
[235:44.61]No, lava chicken.
[235:45.37]Lava chicken.
[235:46.27]Lava chicken.
[235:49.05]Diamond dick ass.
[235:50.93]I was like, why?
[235:51.79]Dude, I could have a chicken right now.
[236:04.02]Don't go in.
[236:05.26]Hey dude, if you go back to town, come right back, then you owe me $10.
[236:09.38]Okay.
[236:09.68]Sure.
[236:16.58]I took care of that guy by myself without your help.
[236:41.10]spear is fun I like it I think it really helps that they added the uh the culling strike thing makes it feel really good oh my goodness
[237:23.17]So how many more?
[237:24.09]So like sword, for instance, like just a one handed sword.
[237:33.49]Is there a class that's going to predominantly using one handed swords?
[237:39.46]So the alternate to the current warrior, who is the Mace guy, there is a sword guy.
[237:44.90]And they're still doing that release of like whenever he comes out.
[237:51.27]Interesting.
[237:52.27]is when they're gonna put swords in the game which hopefully is sooner than later there's a lot of people that have been you know saying the same of like put swords in my video game and they did they're they're just waiting to get it in there because everyone's waiting for it's gonna be like a huge deal marauder is axe the other uh mercenary which would be gladiator's sword oh okay
[238:18.65]would love an axe or a sword but uh most likely druid is the next class I would expect to come out in the next in like three months wonder is that gonna be some kind of staff or is that a um that's the main thing that he also gets some scepters uh he should have flails interesting but I I think I I'm not sure because templar is supposed to have flails drew it I don't know uh but druid has the shape shifting so you can like turn into a werebear kind of thing yep that's cool
[238:50.19]It might not be that one, but they've already had like a preview trailer of all the things that Druid can do.
[238:56.07]So I assume it's the most likely.
[239:00.65]Who doesn't want to be a big bear?
[239:04.19]I know I do.
[239:04.89]I want to see different transformations.
[239:13.38]I want to see you like frog.
[239:18.85]I believe he's supposed to have three different ones.
[239:22.18]There is a werewolf bear and something else.
[239:26.46]Do you think we can kill the boss?
[239:27.92]I feel like that's actually a pretty difficult encounter to do.
[239:32.84]I can dodge everything he does forever.
[239:38.79]By decree of the Count of Ogham, effective immediately.
[239:42.86]This is what I was saying.
[239:45.14]It's not everyone's not allowed to be in the area.
[239:47.82]It's all crimes are now punishable by death.
[239:53.24]Oh, that's a little bit different.
[239:55.34]That's a little bit different, I think.
[239:58.27]Everyone's not allowed to be in the area.
[240:01.95]That was like the count version of autocorrect on a phone.
[240:11.95]Alert.
[240:12.63]Alert.
[240:13.29]Alert.
[240:13.81]Everyone is not allowed to be in the area.
[240:21.38]Oh, hey, Buster.
[240:24.02]Do you need this?
[240:24.68]I might.
[240:27.98]Oodalogy.
[240:30.77]I don't know if you do, but I'm done using it.
[240:33.23]That's kind of amazing, yeah.
[240:35.11]Can I put it in?
[240:42.12]Uh, I'm gonna replace that.
[240:49.82]Shit just does more damage, right?
[240:54.06]But no elemental damage.
[240:57.08]So don't put it on your fire spear.
[240:58.91]No, I'm putting it on spear throw.
[241:00.09]Okay.
[241:03.87]This thing's gonna be rocking people now.
[241:08.41]Finally got it.
[241:10.80]Alright, damage penetrates 12% elemental resistance and 10% increased area of effect.
[241:17.29]That is going to be great for this.
[241:21.95]Nice.
[241:29.89]I think we're almost there, right?
[241:33.07]At the castle or wherever it is.
[241:34.99]Yep, it's going to be right to our left.
[241:38.56]and then we got to go through a few floors of the castle and then we get to fight big boy I'm excited I think I think he's my favorite boss I think he's really well done I like the giant colossus thing and let's choose the big laser beam out of his head I wish I could do that be cool yeah but instead of a laser beam it's like
[242:07.81]You know.
[242:09.37]A decree of the Count of Orgrim.
[242:16.29]Orgrim.
[242:19.85]Org.
[242:23.31]Now to do with a tyrant, but stick his head on a pipe.
[242:49.26]I can't wait we're gonna get probably two with reuniques this is a weird enemy rage gasp see he did it see
[243:10.80]Pelt Mantle.
[243:14.30]Grand Mana Flask.
[243:15.56]Yeah.
[243:16.59]I have so much shit in my inventory.
[243:20.73]Level 16.
[243:27.57]Hold on.
[243:28.11]I got new boots.
[243:31.08]These are a thousand times better.
[243:32.26]15% movement speed?
[243:36.45]We need cold resist, right?
[243:38.31]Cold resist is important.
[243:40.11]These things suck.
[243:43.81]They have cold resist on them if you want them.
[243:48.00]Oh, I thought your old boots was the rare boots we had earlier.
[243:51.38]Oh, you... They're in my stash.
[243:55.14]Oh, okay, because you're just collecting.
[243:57.00]I mean, we haven't really been back to town since you humiliated me in front of 500,000 people.
[244:04.68]So, no, I didn't get a chance to really hang out in town.
[244:07.46]I didn't do anything.
[244:18.57]Do you want to go hang out in town?
[244:20.99]You want to go get like a smoothie?
[244:22.15]What about the boss?
[244:22.93]I do.
[244:23.13]What about the boss?
[244:23.89]I do.
[244:24.05]Oh, that'd be nice.
[244:33.07]I love this music.
[244:42.25]Somebody said you're inflating your view count.
[244:45.55]There's 650,000 concurrent viewers over the course of three to six months.
[244:55.64]I didn't tell you a time frame.
[245:00.32]Ooh.
[245:02.73]Oh, this way.
[245:03.25]This way.
[245:05.63]Oh, not concurrent.
[245:06.59]I mean, yeah, 500,000 viewers over six months.
[245:14.53]17,000 crumbs.
[245:15.15]This thing comes alive?
[245:17.49]Dude.
[245:17.59]Be careful.
[245:19.79]You're kind of killing people.
[245:48.82]When you're worried about the boss.
[245:50.92]I mean, the boss is way has way more help than this.
[246:04.27]Or does he?
[246:06.08]Kind of does.
[246:20.58]now it's so much better go rolled 20 max health level five give me that oh lazuli where is it right here okay barrage
[246:45.12]Ready a volley of arrows or spears.
[246:48.28]Empowering your next projectile spear attack to repeat multiple times.
[246:54.14]Damn.
[246:55.76]So this could do... Could I do this with explosive spear?
[246:59.74]It still has the limit of two.
[247:02.67]But yeah.
[247:03.01]I'm going to try it.
[247:19.91]Alright, what am I not using?
[247:21.23]I'm really not using... I'm not really doing parry.
[247:26.68]I'm just not.
[247:27.28]Let's just face it.
[247:30.48]You really should against the boss.
[247:32.68]Otherwise, you're not going to get those Fuenzy charges.
[247:34.96]Oh, fuck.
[247:35.52]You're right.
[247:38.12]What am I not doing?
[247:39.00]Disengage?
[247:41.32]No.
[247:44.18]Don't controllers have other buttons?
[247:45.92]Yeah.
[247:53.58]So that gets it ready and then I can go wham wham.
[247:59.28]Thank you ma'am.
[248:16.96]I can only do it once, so it will be three times effectively.
[248:20.34]It's three explosions.
[248:23.35]But you can only have two fire spears.
[248:29.32]Is that true?
[248:31.52]Yeah.
[248:32.38]Wait, so I need to activate it.
[248:34.02]Throw a three.
[248:38.02]That wasn't... Oh, shit.
[248:39.98]Okay.
[248:42.44]So I really need to... So that is... So my support gem in here is not really doing anything anymore, is it?
[248:51.91]which one this one plus one to limit because it's just two yeah so this would not be because it isn't the thing I just got making it two I think you're confused what I'm saying is duplicates your attack but there's a hard limit on explosive spears of you can only have two
[249:17.87]or if you remove that gem you can only have one so even if you duplicate with barrage it's still only going to be the limit so I shouldn't duplicate explosive spear correct okay so I can add something else now uh we need to do a town run uh when we get to the boss okay let's hold hands
[249:45.80]You actually got so much movement speed stuff.
[249:48.26]It's not okay.
[249:51.16]It is actually pretty cool.
[249:59.53]I feel so powerful.
[250:02.07]You are.
[250:04.72]You are.
[250:10.52]bro bro your arms kind of huge you've been hitting the gym huh I was thinking about it that's that's really all you need just to think about it I've seen people lose a lot of weight thinking about it
[250:49.97]Lightning bolt.
[250:51.55]Lightning bolt.
[250:52.81]Lightning bolt.
[250:53.77]I might try lightning spear eventually here soon.
[250:58.06]Or maybe just stab.
[251:03.80]Stab?
[251:04.46]Stab or...
[251:10.62]I'm going to try stab.
[251:14.44]Oh, what's your what's your ARPG like fantasy character do?
[251:20.87]Oh, lightning bolts.
[251:22.35]What's yours do?
[251:23.25]Stab.
[251:25.19]Yeah, probably better than lightning bolt and a lot of stuff.
[251:27.29]What's wrong with that?
[251:30.70]Yeah, you say that when you're wearing metal armor and it's conductive to electricity.
[251:38.64]You think that you would beat my wizard?
[251:48.51]Now it's true.
[251:49.21]I think again, you're right.
[251:50.79]I mean, you're a dick, but you're right.
[251:54.00]Just the way it is.
[252:01.34]If they go on Mythbusters to see if you can like.
[252:06.25]how fast you can run to someone who has a gun not much faster than you I am yeah but but with lightning wizard I know this is driving you crazy by the way I know you want the movement speed so bad that's fine I'm I'm and I'm just here along I'm here along for the ride oh let's do it I was gonna add a mod to it because we only got a negative mod so you can use your orbs on it
[252:36.54]Oh, that's cool.
[252:38.22]I, that sounded fake, but I really think that's cool.
[252:47.47]Thanks for the clarification.
[252:50.43]I was, I was concerned.
[252:51.75]See?
[252:56.87]Okay.
[253:05.50]I can't tell if it's you making a voice or is that... That's too many things.
[253:09.84]Hold on.
[253:17.55]Where is it?
[253:21.31]What does it look like?
[253:23.27]Oh, okay.
[253:23.55]It looks like a face.
[253:26.89]Someone that you used to know.
[253:32.81]Why can I not see this?
[253:36.15]I've seen you mouse over it, like... Why do you have this as... It's a good sound.
[253:45.81]Especially because it plays when you kill a monster and it just sounds like they... They drop something good, you know?
[253:51.52]See, my sound pack would have it be like... A little more exalted, regal, choir...
[254:06.39]I said I would have done whatever sounds you wanted.
[254:08.65]I told you back in the day there was a Path of Exile 1 that had like all casino noises that I think would make you really enjoy that game.
[254:16.11]Where it's just like casino slot.
[254:19.81]It's true.
[254:21.39]You can make the sounds like as long as you want.
[254:23.75]You could have a novel start playing when an exalted drops.
[254:28.09]That's so stupid.
[254:29.01]I love it.
[254:37.63]come closer I always wonder about the freeloaders in this place when you get here like how many freeloaders he has in the castle that are like not doing anything isn't everything a crime here too everything
[255:12.70]writer I don't know I just feel like if he had these forces he would use them for something gooner's journal don't read that and I cannot I just did that which I know deep down to be true that fair-haired villager an eternal descendant
[255:42.55]So eventually you'll be able to hold on.
[255:51.68]Yeah, you will.
[255:53.86]So I could get the lightning spear on anyone eventually.
[255:58.02]We can write some of the wrongs of the past.
[256:00.74]She promises a way forward.
[256:03.66]A way forward.
[256:06.75]Of course.
[256:09.54]yeah no it should just get more more interesting the more classes are at it so like we just got huntress and all the spear skills and then you can obviously use the spear skills on anyone else so I think like especially with druid druid's gonna have its whole like uh elemental spells like volcano and tornado stuff maybe see that I'm looking forward to that that's what I want to play
[256:33.01]yeah the one combo they showed in the druid trailer that seemed really cool is like you can create volcanoes on the ground and when warriors slam them or your bear form slams them it makes them like erupt more and like the more layers of skills they had eventually when you especially when you co-op and you have like one warrior guy and one volcano guy it seems like you could do some really goofy stuff I feel like we've already been blowing stuff up with the poison fire stuff that's been pretty cool
[257:04.96]yeah the volcano seemed like the goofiest thing uh that I've seen from the game so far but no druid yet a bear looked really fun too I like big bears I'm really excited about the new donkey kong he's not quite a bear but like that's not unfair I mean it's like same a man bear
[257:38.65]Give me those charges!
[257:46.86]You gotta get him.
[257:51.82]You killed him so easily that I can't get my charge.
[257:57.15]You're such a gamer.
[258:02.15]Get him!
[258:04.21]I'm not attacking him so you can get it.
[258:06.60]I got so locked in throwing spears at him.
[258:09.70]Oh.
[258:10.84]But I thought it was me.
[258:11.76]I thought that was the problem.
[258:14.90]Glad you figured it out finally.
[258:18.76]Wrong way.
[258:25.55]Swear, man, if you don't just freaking start being nice.
[258:41.09]It's cool.
[258:42.77]So you're not even hearing it.
[258:44.11]The scroll of wisdom noise.
[258:46.39]I don't think I am.
[258:48.51]Maybe it's turned out your your no, your brain just you're not registering that it's even different.
[258:53.26]It just feels natural.
[259:01.16]Well, you maybe drop on the ground.
[259:02.34]What if they get lost?
[259:04.98]All 24 of them?
[259:05.76]No, no.
[259:06.38]Stop.
[259:06.50]Uncut 5!
[259:06.92]Uncut 5!
[259:07.36]Let me take a look at that shit.
[259:09.72]Rapid Assault.
[259:35.23]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[259:36.59]Rapid stabs.
[259:41.71]Oh, stab.
[259:43.69]Okay, spear field.
[259:45.00]Storm Lance is pretty good too because it's like the lightning version of the explosive spear.
[259:50.40]I kind of want to try the stab one.
[259:55.00]You do you.
[259:58.30]No, but I got all elemental damage in my... I can make this elemental damage, can't I?
[260:04.22]rapid assault um no rapid assault does the elemental damage from like there's nothing that converts fizz to elemental from support gems I'll put it into exploding spear I'm using it a lot holy this thing is amazing uh yeah let's put that on
[260:36.36]Hold resist.
[260:48.17]Wrong way.
[260:50.53]Oh, you scrolls.
[260:51.17]Pick up.
[260:51.79]Okay.
[260:53.29]Oh, you added a few.
[260:54.19]Thank you.
[260:54.57]I appreciate it.
[260:59.77]That's what I'm here for.
[261:03.57]You better play with me again.
[261:06.41]I want to go back to the thing I was doing before.
[261:09.91]I like it more.
[261:10.41]Yeah.
[261:22.42]And then call of the week.
[261:24.00]And then, yeah.
[261:26.38]A lot of buttons for my brain to have to press right now.
[261:30.16]I was going to say, Huntress has a lot of the buttons and combos.
[261:34.92]It's really cool, but I kind of want to just throw fire spear at somebody.
[261:39.77]This is it.
[261:41.01]We're here.
[261:41.27]Yep.
[261:42.13]Oh, shit.
[261:44.09]I went down.
[261:45.39]Is that bad?
[261:48.01]I don't think I can go to town now.
[261:49.95]Can I just make it a portal and you can... I goofed.
[261:55.54]I'll let him kill me.
[262:02.20]Your health is just slowly going down.
[262:04.66]No!
[262:04.86]Help!
[262:05.18]Help!
[262:05.76]Help!
[262:08.06]Oh, it looks like you're getting killed by a bunch of shovels.
[262:11.20]Yeah.
[262:15.43]Imagine that's the way you go.
[262:19.97]It says wait for a party member to revive me.
[262:21.93]Uh-oh.
[262:24.55]Do we have to just go for it?
[262:25.89]Just go to town?
[262:26.51]Just go to town.
[262:27.07]Just leave me.
[262:27.85]Leave me!
[262:28.27]Alright, I left.
[262:29.77]Ahem.
[262:52.83]I got so much home in town.
[262:55.29]Disengage so many things as you whirling slash hits enemies and creates.
[263:00.18]I can see the videos now that blinds and slows enemies inside it.
[263:04.96]Lightning Spears disengage flips backwards as you set.
[263:11.44]Whirling slash hits enemies and creates.
[263:14.14]Alright, Herald of Blood I think is going to be.
[263:21.49]my passive because I don't do any thunder damage uh do you do any physical damage that applies bleed besides spear stab I don't think so maybe wind is quite the commitment I mean I do throw regular spears they don't bleed what else is what else should I do
[263:49.67]Thunder.
[263:50.81]I mean, wind answer is evasion, right?
[263:54.75]Yeah.
[263:56.23]Under Thunderfield really good, but even if you just get like lightning damage on a ring, then you can shock OK.
[264:03.22]I'll do this specifically use a. Like this, just like a like a defense buff like this is helpful.
[264:10.86]Yep.
[264:14.78]And it is now on.
[264:17.80]Cool.
[264:20.18]Alright, I need to seriously take a look at what I got going on here.
[264:24.64]Before we fight the boss.
[264:39.75]Put all my shit in here.
[264:52.53]Starting to fill up my, uh, inventory.
[264:55.81]Pretty cool.
[265:00.45]I'd sell all this crap.
[265:03.57]So this is cold damage, right?
[265:05.33]Coming up.
[265:08.49]Yes.
[265:13.65]Level five.
[265:14.51]Cool.
[265:19.83]I think I'm going to do disengage again.
[265:30.91]Yeah.
[265:34.27]There is only one thing.
[265:35.56]Enter.
[265:36.02]Yeah.
[265:36.26]We're gonna kill the count.
[265:38.42]It really be like that.
[265:39.56]Sell this shit.
[265:41.16]Here's what I got.
[265:43.64]I make good scrap.
[265:49.90]Uh, can I make a gray white greater life flask of blue one?
[265:55.55]Yeah.
[265:55.79]Ooh.
[265:59.00]Now you're thinking with orbs.
[266:00.58]Really?
[266:08.94]This guy's got freaking orbs.
[266:10.76]Good.
[266:11.40]Can you add stuff to the like magic modifiers?
[266:15.99]You actually can.
[266:16.77]Okay.
[266:19.01]This is fun.
[266:21.13]I completely forgot all about this.
[266:24.63]It's good too.
[266:26.25]I can do it to your charm.
[266:28.41]Oh shit.
[266:33.86]What if I make it a rare?
[266:34.78]Is that stupid?
[266:36.92]You cannot make them rare.
[266:38.22]There's some items that can only go up to magic.
[266:43.62]Charges.
[266:44.74]I really want charges per second on a flask.
[266:48.32]Somebody sells it here, right?
[266:50.28]Yes.
[266:51.10]I chug potions like crazy.
[266:54.93]If you get lucky, I think they can have it.
[266:56.67]Otherwise, it is you saw on the skill tree.
[267:03.27]I'm gonna roll for it.
[267:14.39]There even just like less charges used to help.
[267:17.27]That's good.
[267:18.05]I think that counts, right?
[267:22.83]Kill an enemy.
[267:23.45]I think there's ads here, right?
[267:25.75]Yeah.
[267:26.82]Nice.
[267:30.34]It's too strong.
[267:35.72]I still don't have enough strength to do that.
[267:40.08]Alright.
[267:42.95]I think I'm ready.
[267:43.55]Let me take a quick look at my skills.
[267:48.75]Are you sure you're ready?
[267:50.91]Hold on.
[267:52.33]What do I got here?
[267:53.79]Wait, but are you sure?
[267:55.31]I'm not.
[267:56.64]This is your last chance because if you die during this fight, there will be omega lulls.
[268:04.55]Extra fire damage, plus one to limit.
[268:09.97]What about disengage?
[268:10.99]I want to add some shit to disengage.
[268:15.79]What can I put on it?
[268:24.12]Dude, how many support gems do you have?
[268:25.98]Not a lot.
[268:28.14]This guy's cheating.
[268:28.84]I don't have a lot.
[268:29.30]This guy's cheating.
[268:30.06]That was a lot.
[268:33.22]Ooh, unyielding seems kind of good.
[268:36.28]That kind of seemed like a lot.
[268:37.70]I'll put an unyielding.
[268:48.40]And... Maybe...
[269:04.65]That's kind of good.
[269:06.37]Ignite chance.
[269:19.94]Cost less lead chance.
[269:27.38]Stun build up.
[269:29.14]A lot of options it seems.
[269:39.16]Well, we're going to kick his ass, so who cares?
[269:40.74]I'm going to put on ignite chance.
[269:50.55]Alright.
[269:51.85]I'm ready.
[269:53.51]Ready to fuck him up?
[269:55.79]Yes, sir.
[269:56.95]Sir, yes, sir.
[270:07.49]Okay, I can't go in it.

[274:07.28]Do not let him get you.
[274:10.04]You don't want to know what happens if he gets you.
[274:11.68]He bites your fucking head.
[274:46.01]Did it in every spot that I just went to.
[274:49.47]We'll just walk.
[274:52.05]Oh, he was about to get stunned.

[274:59.44]I need these executes.
[275:11.50]Fuck, I keep dodging into it.
[275:23.95]Trying to set him up for you.
[275:28.97]I smell what the rocket's cooking.
[275:35.51]Sorry.
[275:36.92]Ancient old person joke.
[275:39.12]Oh!

[275:45.85]You can do it.
[275:46.21]You can do it.
[275:47.17]You want me to kill him?
[275:47.97]No, kill him.
[275:48.49]I just did the fucking husky joke from my TikTok.
[275:51.03]You can do it.
[275:57.25]I don't know.
[275:57.65]I need you to do it.
[275:58.43]I need you.
[275:58.89]Dude, I need you.
[276:00.40]Dude, I need you.
[276:05.38]He's almost dead.
[276:06.20]He's almost dead.
[276:06.90]Just kill him.
[276:07.56]I need you.
[276:08.06]I need you.
[276:10.23]If you need me, then you can bring me back when he's dead.
[276:13.97]So I can look at all the shiny things on the ground.
[276:16.59]We got it.
[276:23.97]We got it.
[276:25.53]Uh oh.
[276:28.32]Big problem coming up here.
[276:29.76]Oh, heads.
[276:36.82]Through an endless night.
[276:42.10]You like this?
[276:45.24]Where are you?
[276:45.92]They can't catch me.
[276:54.91]Alright, but bring him up to the top left before you kill him.
[277:02.95]Because I want to see all the loot.
[277:07.40]He's not at the top left.
[277:08.98]What are you doing?
[277:09.86]Dude, there's a whole cutscene.
[277:11.80]You have like five minutes before this loot drops.
[277:15.54]Go over here and wait for the loot like a good boy.
[277:19.13]Oh, we do have a long time.
[277:21.09]You're right.
[277:31.54]Come on, where's the loot?
[277:32.28]Where's the loot?
[277:33.38]Oh, come on.
[277:33.88]We don't care.
[277:34.44]I just want to see it.
[277:35.62]Come on.
[277:36.24]Please.
[277:36.58]Yes.
[278:06.11]I thought it was a unique.
[278:07.75]See, less cool.
[278:08.95]It would normally make no noise.
[278:13.35]I mean, Exalted Orb is good.
[278:16.55]It's really good.
[278:17.69]I'll take it.
[278:19.71]What about the Bone Rainment?
[278:24.07]I want to take a look at this.
[278:27.71]Sorry.
[278:39.88]Nice.
[278:41.56]Epic kill.
[278:44.58]No, that's great.
[278:45.68]We actually did it.
[278:49.16]Yeah, we did it.
[278:51.65]We did.
[278:52.49]I just added the last 10%.
[278:53.73]Actually kind of a terrible roll.
[279:00.41]Terrible.
[279:11.42]What an awful night to have a curse.
[279:18.30]It's a lot of charges.
[279:19.20]Do what he's into it.
[279:25.04]Good game.
[279:26.38]The game that can make you read.
[279:29.50]That is act one.
[279:35.92]Now, they didn't add any... They changed the map stuff, right?
[279:41.06]Yeah.
[279:43.12]They improved a lot of the campaign levels that were really excruciatingly long, especially in Act 3.
[279:50.25]Some of them were a little bit big.
[279:53.27]There is supposed to be six acts.
[279:55.23]Currently, there's only three.
[279:56.41]And you play through the game effectively again, then you get to the maps.
[280:02.95]Yeah.
[280:04.07]Cool.
[280:07.27]Well, I think, I think that that's probably could wrap it up.
[280:13.51]Yeah, it was a good time.
[280:14.39]I was glad to finally get to PUE co-op game and especially with you, my favorite little baby boo boo.
[280:20.54]Hey, it was fun.
[280:23.34]Um, yeah.
[280:26.89]obviously huge thank you to Ster because uh I I've played this before but it's way easier when somebody kind of knows what they're doing to tell you what to do so uh Ster is a an expert he's a very he's a very good gamer in uh in path of exile in the cookbook you just want to cook by uh using recipes
[280:51.84]Also, it was sponsored.
[280:53.10]So this was obviously thanks to Grind and Gear for the sponsor.
[280:58.58]Thanks to all of you for watching.
[281:01.24]Weird technical problems in the beginning of the stream.
[281:03.60]I have no idea why my OBS decided it was going to just revert to 30 FPS 720p.
[281:11.70]I haven't changed a single setting.
[281:13.95]I streamed two days ago.
[281:15.99]I don't know what happened.
[281:17.63]I'm going to have to look into why that happened.
[281:30.17]But yeah.
[281:32.63]Again, game is on early access.
[281:34.73]This is Donald Hunt.
[281:36.59]This is the update.
[281:37.79]I know we have heard it a million times, but it seems like they added a lot of content.
[281:42.30]Seems like there's going to be more added eventually.
[281:45.12]So.
[281:46.20]Oh yeah, the PoE patches are awesome because they like when you say they added 100 uniques like three months from now, there's going to be a patch of similar size.
[281:53.68]That's why after 10 years of PoE 1, it is as massive and interesting of a game as it is.
[281:59.62]Yeah.
[282:02.02]And I had fun with it when it launched and I was waiting for another patch and then obviously sponsor came through too.
[282:07.74]So I was like, well, fuck, let's do it.
[282:09.26]That sounds fun.
[282:12.30]Yeah.
[282:12.80]Until next time, Ster.
[282:14.26]I'll talk to you soon.
[282:15.90]Yeah, it was fun.
[282:16.50]Thank you.
[282:16.94]Have fun with the rest of your stream.
[282:18.60]Yeah.
[282:20.66]See you later.
[282:22.07]Bye bye.
[282:26.29]Ster is great.
[282:26.83]Everybody follow Ster.
[282:31.44]So I did say I was going to play Chrono Trigger.
[282:34.78]So that is exactly what I'm not going to do.
[282:38.52]I have to give you an unfortunate sorry here.
[282:41.48]I'm sorry.
[282:47.41]Here's the deal.
[282:50.19]I got so unbelievably hungry like 40 minutes ago.
[282:53.98]I don't know why, but I did.
[282:58.16]Why did you word it like that?
[282:59.32]I don't know, cause Ster was like, we were having fun making weird fucking sentences.
[283:09.09]So here's what we're gonna do.
[283:11.97]I'll be live tomorrow.
[283:14.27]And I will be live tomorrow with Scary Games.
[283:17.41]Tomorrow is gonna be an Ichio Horror Night.
[283:20.39]Don't miss that one.
[283:24.79]probably going to open up another five, six or so 20 to 30 minute experiences, maybe a little bit longer ones.
[283:34.81]And then Sunday, here's my, here's what's going to happen Sunday.
[283:39.86]Sunday, also going to be a sponsor on Sunday.
[283:42.71]I didn't, honestly, I didn't plan it to be like this.
[283:45.49]I typically wouldn't do it like this.
[283:47.93]But these two just, this just kind of came up.
[283:50.49]And it was like, oh, hey, Marvel rivals, by the way.
[283:52.61]And I was like, um, okay.
[283:54.24]I played that game before.
[283:55.08]It's like the first time ever that, like, I've actually wanted to do a couple sponsors that came through.
[284:03.79]So, that's only for two hours, though.
[284:05.81]So that's gonna be two hours on Sunday.
[284:08.40]That will be a small portion of a much larger stream, which will include Chrono Trigger.
[284:13.74]Don't worry.
[284:19.06]So, scary games tomorrow night.
[284:22.06]Probably Chrono Trigger, Marvel Rivals, and...
[284:26.73]You know, maybe Ster will play Marvel... Maybe Ster will play Marvel Rivals with us.
[284:30.92]Marvel... I can't say that.
[284:32.38]Let me get it right before Sunday.
[284:38.91]Post-retirement sellout arc.
[284:41.49]Let's fucking go.
[284:47.42]No, honestly, it's like PoE 2 came through, and I wanted to play PoE 2.
[284:51.91]I was thinking about it, and I was like, wait a minute, that sounds kind of cool.
[284:54.17]We can do this thing where Sterk kind of helps me, and we do a little thing.
[284:59.29]And also, too, Marvel Rivals was like, oh, that's going to be fun, because I played that before, too.
[285:04.67]But that's going to end it for tonight.
[285:10.94]I'm very hungry.
[285:12.90]You play with the controller?
[285:13.72]I do play with the controller.
[285:14.82]I actually have fun with it.
[285:25.95]Yeah, Ster made the joke before, and we talked about it two days ago, but... Ster's like, hey, will you play PoE with me?
[285:32.07]Let's play PoE 2.
[285:33.20]We could do PoE on stream.
[285:34.36]And I'm like, nah, maybe, yeah.
[285:37.22]So thank you, Grinding Gear Games, for finally, like, starting this off.
[285:41.98]Because I'm probably going to play with them again at some point.
[285:50.25]It took a sponsor to get me to, like, get on here.
[285:54.54]But I do enjoy the game a lot.
[285:55.75]It's really fun.
[285:58.17]I won't play with my friend.
[286:04.37]It took 10 years.
[286:10.16]Thank you, Devs, for forcing him to hang out with his friend.
[286:19.28]Yeah, but go check it out.
[286:20.93]I genuinely think PoE 2 is a great game.
[286:24.02]You should check it out too.
[286:25.94]I'll see you tomorrow.
[286:26.62]Scary Games starting about 5 o'clock Pacific.
[286:31.00]That's going to be all we do tomorrow night.
[286:32.66]We're going to probably go late into the night.
[286:34.54]Starting at 5.
[286:34.90]See you guys tomorrow night.
[286:50.61]I'm going to have a new cam set up.
[286:52.05]So...
[286:54.17]There'll be plenty to see.
[286:56.83]I got some cool shit that you can see on cam two.
[286:59.35]I'm ready.
[287:11.72]Is the new cam gonna be even worse?
[287:13.68]Well, the new cam is actually the old cam that I got to stop crashing every 10 seconds.
[287:21.64]So it's cam number four.
[287:25.40]I believe.
[287:25.74]Alright, I'll talk to you guys later.
[287:44.38]See you tomorrow.
[287:46.68]Hey, you know what?
[287:49.32]I might even drink a beer tomorrow night.
[287:53.60]Hey, we might get crazy tomorrow night.
[288:03.73]Take care of yourself.
[288:04.53]See you later.
[288:07.60]Ta-ta for now.
