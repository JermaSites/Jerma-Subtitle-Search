[00:05.02]Hey.
[00:05.78]Sorry.
[00:06.06]I was on my phone.
[00:08.86]I was looking on my phone.
[00:09.80]I was looking at stuff.
[00:13.28]Hello, everybody.
[00:14.00]Happy Saturday.
[00:14.86]Hope you're having a good Saturday.
[00:16.48]Hope you had a good week.
[00:19.76]Hope you're all doing very, very, very well.
[00:24.61]How am I?
[00:25.03]I'm doing good.
[00:27.91]I'm doing as good as I can be.
[00:34.63]He loves his phone.
[00:38.43]Not really.
[00:38.97]I mean, I... I like FaceTiming my mother.
[00:47.82]That's fun.
[00:50.54]That's something you couldn't do five years ago.
[00:54.58]When did FaceTime... Okay, when did FaceTime become a thing people were doing?
[00:58.76]2015?
[01:00.04]2016?
[01:00.06]When did FaceTime come out?
[01:09.39]It was 10 years ago, was it?
[01:10.85]No, it wasn't.
[01:14.43]The iPhone 4 and the iPhone 3 couldn't do FaceTime, could they?
[01:19.25]No, no, it was like 2015.
[01:21.55]One sec.
[01:29.57]It was 2013.
[01:30.63]Anybody else have this problem?
[01:33.43]Is anybody else permanently in 2013, 2014?
[01:40.76]What happened in 2013, 2014?
[01:41.32]I feel like 2014 is like, that's just every year.
[01:42.40]It's not 2021.
[01:42.62]No, it's 2014.
[01:45.30]Time loop.
[01:45.60]I don't feel like it's 2021.
[01:46.62]I feel like it's at most 2015.
[02:11.23]because in 2012 the world ended and what like did our planet got like detonated and we all got uploaded to the cloud or something what do you mean unironically yes oh unironically yes
[02:37.00]And maybe it's because you peaked in 2015.
[02:39.14]That's not true at all, by the way.
[02:41.38]You know, every year kind of feels like 2014.
[02:45.38]I wish it was like 2015.
[02:45.96]Remember when I was getting like a million views a video on YouTube?
[02:49.40]Oh man, every day feels like it should be 2014, doesn't it?
[02:55.57]By the way, I inflated those numbers.
[02:57.05]It was like 600 or 700k.
[02:59.39]But you round up.
[03:00.75]Especially when you're marketing yourself.
[03:06.81]Anyway, today we're gonna play Barnfinders.
[03:08.33]It's a game that I played very, very briefly for about 15 minutes while I was raging at Fall Guys.
[03:16.58]During that, like, Fall Guys week where the game just came out and the servers were all fucked up, I was- I tried to play it, I couldn't play it, and I was like, well, I gotta pivot, I gotta do something else.
[03:26.76]And I had Barn Finders installed.
[03:29.33]I was like, alright, I guess I'm gonna play this, and I didn't give it the proper time and respect that I think it might deserve.
[03:34.83]Because Fall Guys servers came back online, and I wasn't even paying attention to this game.
[03:38.83]I was just raging about the servers.
[03:40.95]And somebody, like, baited me into thinking that a Fall Guys dev was talking to me.
[03:46.59]Remember that?
[03:47.68]I couldn't give the attention to Barnfinders that it deserves.
[03:50.12]So what is Barnfinders?
[03:51.00]This is a game where you go search for antiques.
[03:54.40]You go to auctions.
[03:56.64]And you sell antiques.
[03:58.42]It looks like it's going to be right up my alley.
[04:02.00]That was peak Jerma.
[04:03.06]Well, that was like a year ago.
[04:05.34]Not even.
[04:05.82]That was like seven months ago.
[04:08.27]If I peaked here, listen to me.
[04:10.65]If you're telling me that I peaked, I peaked career wise, like six months ago.
[04:16.37]Holy shit.
[04:17.91]That's awesome.
[04:19.72]I can ride this shit for the next 10 years.
[04:23.06]I could put up trash can content for the next 10 years and just slowly go down.
[04:27.60]If you tell me I peaked six months ago, I've been doing this for 10 years.
[04:32.48]Wow.
[04:36.95]You peaked at the imposter is sus.
[04:40.42]But you're already doing that.
[04:42.72]You have no idea what I have for this year.
[04:46.66]No, I'll... You know what?
[04:48.46]I bet you I peak this year.
[04:50.40]Alright?
[04:50.86]I'll be honest with you.
[04:52.30]There's like three streams that are going to happen this year.
[04:56.49]Absolutely, I've peaked this year.
[04:57.85]Like, there's nothing I can do that's... Maybe next year.
[05:02.39]The next one to two years is the peak of my entire online internet thing.
[05:07.80]So... I'm not there yet.
[05:11.42]I will be soon, though.
[05:12.84]And I know when to see that.
[05:14.58]I know when to accept that.
[05:15.70]It's probably this year.
[05:18.58]It's not gonna be Catboy.
[05:21.85]Imagine peaking at Catboy.
[05:23.31]God.
[05:25.87]Alright, are you ready?
[05:26.63]Let's play.
[05:27.19]Let's do this.
[05:32.69]I'm going to move you this way.
[05:33.61]Barn finders.
[05:39.51]What's wrong with the audio?
[05:40.65]Is this supposed to sound like this?
[05:42.75]Is this supposed to sound like that?
[05:46.90]Is this copyright?
[05:54.02]Oh no, it's my connector is fucked up.
[05:56.65]You wanna know something funny about how much of a lazy idiot I actually am?
[06:00.61]I have had... Now remember, these things are like a $1.50 on Amazon.
[06:04.73]I have had a busted... You know like those little jacks that you plug in, like a headphone Jack?
[06:12.22]I have a headphone Jack extender that I've had for four years, and it has never worked.
[06:17.60]it's bad there's something wrong with the insides and I have to like juggle and jostle around the cord inside of this thing to get it to make audio come through it it's it's probably two dollars on Amazon I just I just won't do it I don't know why are you sure you want to start what do you mean am I sure that's just scared the out of me this is terrifying
[06:46.37]Juggles is back.
[06:47.31]Alright, so let's give this the actual time it deserves.
[06:56.81]I think I kind of look like this guy right now.
[07:04.41]What do you do in this game?
[07:07.09]You buy and sell antiques.
[07:09.88]up here on the side of this road.
[07:12.34]And there's good folks counting on me.
[07:14.82]Gotta move this load.
[07:18.26]That's why I drive my 18-wheeler all across this big old land.
[07:25.56]Not just my job, more than my living.
[07:29.24]It's the heart of who I am.
[07:31.96]Are these characters?
[07:33.62]Sometimes it's tough, but I rise above and do everything I can.
[07:41.64]Is that an Oscar?
[07:44.14]That was just an Oscar.
[07:45.20]Oh, can I get an Oscar?
[07:48.56]That's probably worth a lot of money.
[07:52.72]Oh, shit.
[07:52.98]This is DMCA.
[07:57.13]Somewhere in America, 1991.
[07:59.61]Largely similar to the real America, but not quite.
[08:01.45]Imagine being concerned about DMCA with America.
[08:06.89]Wake up.
[08:08.75]Young and our generator is down.
[08:12.85]Get a battery from our truck and fix it.
[08:18.23]Let's work awful hard.
[08:19.67]Our vacation awaits.
[08:22.68]Okay.
[08:22.82]Might need to turn the sensitivity up just a little bit.
[08:29.66]90 FOV.
[08:30.48]This guy didn't even play Quake.
[08:34.43]Shut up.
[08:40.35]Okay, movement.
[08:43.35]Dump, look around, interact.
[08:44.53]Okay, so that's crouch.
[08:46.03]So take a battery from your truck and place it in the generator.
[08:48.37]Alright, you got it.
[08:48.93]Do a funny voice.
[08:53.14]I just did one.
[08:53.74]Okay, I'm not going to pick up the briefcase.
[08:57.84]Let's go do the battery.
[09:01.04]This is a beautiful game.
[09:01.84]This looks good on my fucking 3090.
[09:05.31]Welcome to Barn Finders.
[09:06.63]Get car battery from the car's trunk.
[09:09.75]Put it into the generator.
[09:10.96]Use your computer to find jobs and travel all over America.
[09:13.32]Alright, cool.
[09:17.72]Let's go get the battery.
[09:19.51]From the truck.
[09:27.39]Move this shit out of the way.
[09:28.64]Wait, you can throw?
[09:29.32]Hold on.
[09:39.44]Can I hurt anybody?
[09:41.20]No, you can't hurt anybody.
[09:42.09]Never mind.
[09:46.37]It's a 1080.
[09:46.67]No, it's a 3090.
[09:47.97]Extra large.
[09:49.82]Okay, so let's get the battery.
[09:52.78]Open the trunk here.
[09:54.93]Battery.
[09:56.07]Developed by Mikko.
[09:58.45]This battery was designed exclusively to power up Mikko generators.
[10:02.10]Did you guys know that I thought that Mikko, like, the singer, I thought that was a person.
[10:08.98]Up until about, like, three months ago.
[10:11.64]Two months ago.
[10:12.80]I thought Hatsune Mikko was a person.
[10:14.22]I didn't think it was, I did not know that it was a robot.
[10:17.05]I thought that was a singer, and it was like a gorilla's scenario.
[10:24.39]I did not know that.
[10:25.23]I thought it was an actual human being singing songs.
[10:33.44]To mark for transport, enter study mode.
[10:37.62]Rotate item.
[10:40.50]Zoom in and out.
[10:41.82]Mark for transport.
[10:42.98]Okay, place it in the generator.
[10:49.98]She is real.
[10:51.76]She's real.
[10:52.44]Alright, but I'm just saying, like, I thought it was a person, like, somebody in, like, the booth.
[10:58.36]Alright, check your computer for job email.
[11:03.31]Are those guns?
[11:04.25]Why are there guns in this game?
[11:06.51]Oh, man, the 3090 really brings out the fucking foliage, let me tell you.
[11:13.35]Alright, computer.
[11:18.85]It's better than the gorillas.
[11:22.35]Um, um, I just, I don't know if I can agree with you.
[11:30.29]Well, hold on a minute.
[11:30.95]Wait, wait, wait.
[11:31.47]Do you mean like gorillas from like 2000 gorillas from like 2000 to like 2015?
[11:36.50]Or do you mean, what do you mean?
[11:39.04]What are you talking about?
[11:40.66]Like which one?
[11:44.32]That's a dirty computer.
[11:45.30]Alright, email.
[11:46.96]On red.
[11:48.26]A naughty stag for a friend.
[11:50.16]Hello, barn finders.
[11:51.22]Can you help an old friend?
[11:52.78]So I heard there's still a naughty stag at the old red barn.
[11:55.96]Maybe you could find it there for you.
[11:58.62]There's money in it if you do.
[12:00.28]300 bucks to find an old stag?
[12:01.96]Okay.
[12:04.99]At the old red barn.
[12:07.21]Barn hub.
[12:10.57]Okay, there's the old... There's the red barn.
[12:16.81]Travel is one gas or buy gas.
[12:19.72]Alright, so I have to go to the red barn.
[12:22.98]Barnhub.com.
[12:24.26]Why do people do this?
[12:25.94]This is, like, everything has to have, like, a Pornhub reference.
[12:34.89]Okay, barnhub.com.
[12:39.82]Alright, let's go back.
[12:41.42]Right mouse button, log out.
[12:42.80]Travel to Red Barn.
[12:44.08]Look for a naughty stag.
[12:46.40]Where's F1?
[12:49.50]I can drive the truck, right?
[12:50.48]How much is that brick worth?
[12:54.11]Wait.
[12:54.97]Build big shelf.
[12:55.87]This is my store, I think.
[12:57.05]I think you can sell stuff here.
[13:01.73]Not Fall Guys.
[13:05.42]Yeah.
[13:06.06]No, it's not Fall Guys.
[13:07.08]Sorry, I'm not playing Fall Guys.
[13:11.39]Okay, go to the truck.
[13:12.61]Do I have a map?
[13:14.79]I don't.
[13:15.23]Do I not have a map?
[13:15.95]Is this basketball?
[13:19.20]Basketball challenge?
[13:20.18]How do I play the basketball challenge?
[13:26.10]Shit.
[13:33.72]It's that turkey over there that's fucking me up.
[13:37.04]I'm sorry, if you have a basketball court here and every time you're about to shoot, you hear...
[13:50.71]Oh my god, this is fucking hard.
[13:56.82]Oh my god, this is hard.
[14:02.48]This is hard.
[14:03.02]Oh my god, I have to do this before I move on.
[14:25.07]Did I get it?
[14:26.71]Your score.
[14:27.41]I didn't get it.
[14:32.65]What the fuck, man?
[14:33.83]I don't think you can even... This doesn't even have the right physics.
[14:41.09]Holy shit.
[14:42.47]Alright, at some point, if you're looking out the window, do you come out here and like, give me the ball, give me the ball, give me the ball, and then swish and then leave and be like, I just had to do that.
[14:53.06]Got it.
[14:55.50]How's that not... Your score, time left.
[14:58.84]Oh!
[14:59.50]Oh, oh, oh, oh!
[15:12.82]Let's go!
[15:15.28]What do I get for this?
[15:23.83]True story when I was in like middle school I was on like a bath the basketball team like the after-school basketball club Wasn't real like it was just a middle school, right?
[15:33.54]It was like before even like junior high school so They never gave me the ball because I was not very good but I always so badly wanted just to like drain a three so badly and
[15:46.10]There was, like, the good player that got the ball every fucking time, and he was the person that scored, like, 40 points.
[15:51.06]Because all the kids don't, you don't score more than, like, fucking 30 points a game.
[15:54.44]40 points a game when you're, like, 11.
[15:56.82]12.
[15:58.00]So, finally, I got the ball one time, and it was the only time, and I got it selfishly.
[16:02.24]Like, there was a big rebound off the, um, off, like, the backboard.
[16:07.02]And I just, it came to me.
[16:08.55]And it was like, oh, pass it to the guy that will absolutely get a fucking three-point shot.
[16:11.85]No, no, no, no.
[16:12.51]I just stood back.
[16:13.39]I got to here.
[16:14.31]And I got behind the three-point line.
[16:15.69]And I just did a huge, like, I was just trying to be, um, what was his name?
[16:20.76]We were on the Celtics.
[16:22.04]He was awesome.
[16:22.82]He drains threes every time.
[16:25.00]Ray Allen.
[16:25.72]This guy drained threes every time.
[16:27.38]He was, like, the best three-point shooter pretty much to ever live.
[16:29.94]So I tried to, like, mimic what he was doing.
[16:32.64]And it just soared over the backboard.
[16:35.28]It was horrible.
[16:36.70]And then I don't think I went to the next meeting.
[16:38.60]I think I, like, quit after that.
[16:46.85]Like, I just went, like, oh, here we go!
[16:50.27]Give me the ball!
[16:50.71]I got it!
[16:52.45]And I went, like, over that.
[16:55.37]And like, nobody laughed either.
[16:56.71]It wasn't even like that was funny.
[17:00.24]It was just like, oh yeah, like that would, you just, you fucked up the game.
[17:02.72]Like, I don't know, nobody even cared.
[17:04.02]It was like it didn't even happen.
[17:07.10]It was actually as if it did not happen.
[17:11.54]But this actually, I don't understand this.
[17:25.66]What the fuck?
[17:26.28]This is- I don't know- I don't understand this.
[17:29.00]What the hell?
[17:29.70]Why?
[17:30.20]This music doesn't help.
[17:32.76]Who plays weird old-timey music when they play basketball?
[17:44.45]This is way harder than it looks, I'm just gonna tell you.
[17:46.05]You do what you're good at.
[17:46.71]I'm not good at this.
[17:47.19]I'm good at fucking, like, haggling and, like, making people give me more money for stuff that I- I- I'm not good at that kind of thing.
[17:52.99]Let's go to the car.
[18:00.69]Can I get in the car?
[18:03.87]Your car.
[18:05.54]Travel to Red Barn.
[18:06.56]How do I get to the Red Barn?
[18:09.66]Wait, is there like a shit joke?
[18:10.96]Oh, there better be.
[18:14.70]Oh my god!
[18:15.68]Oh my god!

[19:10.25]I'm done talking.
[19:10.81]Alright, I need to go to the computer, right?
[19:17.07]I'm so thrown off right now.
[19:18.21]I didn't think that was gonna... I thought it was gonna be like a jokey cartoon fart sound.
[19:28.00]Okay, travel, right?
[19:41.35]500 million off the debt if you do it again.
[19:43.03]I think you might be one of, like, maybe 100 people here that want to see that again.
[19:47.71]Okay, so what am I looking for?
[19:56.51]I'm looking for the stag.
[19:57.51]The red barn in Dwayne's love nest.
[20:07.89]Okay, we're looking for the stag.
[20:09.82]Exploring abandoned barns.
[20:11.10]As a barn finder, your job is to find requested items.
[20:14.26]Look for other valuable items you can sell them in your shop.
[20:17.94]Search for additional items and secrets.
[20:19.93]Maps are full of them.
[20:20.93]Okay, let's go.
[20:25.03]Boy, that famous red barn.
[20:27.59]Let's explore around stuff.
[20:29.68]Whatever.
[20:29.88]Whatever.
[20:32.01]Alright, I gotta find things.
[20:32.89]I gotta find the stag.
[20:35.14]And then I'm not clicking on any bathrooms ever again.
[20:37.20]Let's just be clear about that.
[20:38.32]What's this?
[20:39.92]Valuable trash.
[20:42.26]Ooh!
[20:43.30]Three bucks to recycle it.
[20:47.89]I love this already.
[20:48.57]Okay.
[20:49.17]If I clean, I get money.
[20:51.15]How much is this worth?
[20:51.75]Can I sell this?
[21:02.92]Valuable trash is your stream.
[21:13.50]Oh, you're wicked funny.
[21:17.62]Break hand?
[21:18.68]Alright, I got 13 bucks.
[21:20.70]Let's clear this shit out.
[21:24.33]Can I break this stuff?
[21:25.25]Is this stuff in the crates?
[21:26.83]If there is, oh boy.
[21:29.89]Need to do a hillbilly voice.
[21:31.65]No, I don't.
[21:35.62]I'm not going to go into a... wait.
[21:36.80]This is a TV.
[21:41.32]Pick up that TV.
[21:46.56]What the fuck just happened?
[21:49.08]Did I get it?
[21:51.30]Oh, DVDs.
[21:56.40]That's a cool picture.
[21:57.14]Why can I not take that?
[21:59.86]No, it's not valuable.
[22:07.37]You got to clean up.
[22:08.23]You got to... Ooh, gas.
[22:12.63]Alright, let me spend time in each room because I love this already.
[22:17.11]I love just cleaning stuff and, like, making money with cleaning.
[22:24.36]I can't get over that, like, shit sound.
[22:27.26]It's in my head now.
[22:30.42]Ooh.
[22:33.06]Was this worth 30 bucks?
[22:36.14]Study mode.
[22:39.46]Alright, this is a classic rocking chair from the early 20th century.
[22:42.02]Handmade from beech wood and protected with a clear matte varnish and wax.
[22:49.28]Yeah, I'll take it.
[22:49.89]You don't have a key.
[23:00.61]You know the song I was going to sing.
[23:02.19]I'm not doing it.
[23:08.42]That's an antique?
[23:09.78]That's the whole point is you find antiques.
[23:11.18]Alright, look for hidden shit.
[23:18.23]Do I have flashlight?
[23:19.53]I don't.
[23:19.89]Do I not?
[23:20.33]I can crouch though.
[23:20.97]Alright.
[23:21.37]Recycle.
[23:24.65]We got a number one victory.
[23:26.13]Recycle the books?
[23:26.85]Why?
[23:27.31]Why can't you sell the books?
[23:31.04]Irma, please be quiet.
[23:31.74]I'm trying to watch TV.
[23:34.17]What is possibly on TV at 1230 Pacific right now?
[23:38.63]That's not a game show or a soap opera.
[23:43.14]What are you watching?
[23:50.68]Spongebob.
[23:52.63]No, television, there's nothing on TV anymore.
[24:00.14]All these networks, it's just, it's so weird.
[24:01.92]I don't even know why cable fucking TV even exists anymore.
[24:05.00]Every network now just plays shit that people liked 10 years ago and has one or two shows that are actually in current airing schedules at like 8 o'clock at night.
[24:17.31]What's the point of having a TV network?
[24:20.73]Ooh, what's that key?
[24:26.40]I really just don't get it.
[24:27.52]Now that's, what is that thing?
[24:29.56]No, no, no.
[24:29.88]Study it.
[24:30.20]Study it.
[24:30.46]I want to see it.
[24:30.80]It's like a frog on a bike.
[24:32.50]I want to see it.
[24:33.40]Whatever.
[24:38.69]You know, everybody wants streaming services.
[24:40.17]And I saw this coming from a mile away.
[24:41.91]I'm the only one that said this.
[24:43.11]I'm the only person that made this point.
[24:45.43]I'm the only one that you know that said this.
[24:48.39]I knew that every single fucking company was going to make their own streaming service.
[24:52.83]So it used to be like $100, $200, $300 plus a month to have like all the cable channels.
[24:59.05]Oh, I want HBO.
[25:00.17]I want Showtime.
[25:01.72]I want Food Network.
[25:04.16]I want the big package.
[25:05.86]So now to get the big package, everybody has their own streaming service.
[25:10.22]So what ends up happening is you have like seven active monthly subscriptions to get the shows you want to watch.
[25:15.68]So it's just $100 to $200 a month anyways because all the cable companies decided, oh, let's just make our own apps and charge $12 a month.
[25:26.27]I'm the only person that said that.
[25:32.39]Alright, there's probably something valuable in here.
[25:36.11]Alright, I still need, um... Don't block the door.
[25:44.05]Get out of the way.
[25:45.55]You're a genius.
[25:46.77]Every expert predicted that.
[25:47.87]No, I'm the only one.
[25:58.61]And you missed crypto.
[26:00.03]No, I didn't.
[26:00.81]What are you talking about?
[26:04.16]I got involved in crypto back in like 2015, 2016.
[26:06.19]What are you talking about?
[26:07.43]I didn't miss crypto.
[26:19.47]I missed crypto.
[26:24.63]He's angry.
[26:27.03]You sold it.
[26:30.68]Well, I mean, that doesn't mean I... Excuse me.
[26:35.29]Just because I sold crypto and got out of crypto in 2018, 2017 does not also mean that I lost all my money.
[26:43.90]What are you talking about?
[26:45.50]You don't know when I got it.
[26:46.60]You don't know when I bought cryptocurrencies.
[26:49.44]You don't know what I had.
[26:50.52]What do you know?
[26:51.56]All you know is that I sold it.
[26:53.14]What do you know?
[26:59.35]Whoa.

[27:20.93]Alright, more, more, more, more.
[27:22.43]I need more stuff.
[27:23.05]I don't know why I wanted to throw that out the window so bad.
[27:36.04]Is it a painting?
[27:38.10]Ooh, it's a painting.
[27:39.10]Collectible poster.
[27:42.98]Oh, wait.
[27:43.72]It's my poster.
[27:50.85]It's the imposter cat.
[27:54.25]What's that?
[27:56.15]Black magic manual.
[27:57.45]18 bucks?
[28:05.78]Alright, somebody buy it.
[28:09.00]Is he gonna be this furious every stream?
[28:10.78]We already went over this last week.
[28:13.98]Every Saturday, you're getting me.
[28:16.66]This is like, you're gonna hear me talk a bunch of shit that I've been bottling up for a week.
[28:23.29]Before, you got a slow trickle of my irritations.
[28:26.19]And now, it just dumps on you every Saturday.

[29:21.17]I don't want that.
[29:22.55]Oh, there it is.

[45:51.51]The TV?
[45:56.25]You want the TV?
[46:00.29]I'll give you $18 for the magic.
[46:04.07]Ah, it can go better than that.
[46:04.95]One more box?
[46:08.49]Alright.
[46:09.47]Yo, let's take it.
[46:12.15]It's like a golf minigame.
[46:13.91]Okay, you want the wolf?
[46:14.67]I have an offer.
[46:15.96]83.
[46:15.98]Haggle.
[46:16.20]High five wolf.
[46:16.66]Do it again.
[46:25.58]Do I just keep doing this?
[46:26.44]Why is nobody talking?
[46:36.85]Read your PC computer email.
[46:47.83]What are you just in here?
[46:51.74]Personal computer computer.
[46:55.43]What the f- Wait, what?
[46:57.31]Oh, I have to talk to them.
[47:06.54]That was easy.
[47:21.06]Why am I so good at it?
[47:22.20]That's not hard to do.
[47:26.43]Did I sell everything?
[47:27.74]Oh, not the- there's somebody wants a chair.
[47:33.26]Oh, you want the chair?
[47:34.00]33 bucks?
[47:38.90]Come on.
[47:41.34]I'll get it every time.
[47:43.06]I'm so confident in being able to do that.
[47:44.96]Ooh, it's alright.
[47:49.12]Cool, man.
[47:49.68]Okay.
[47:52.09]I don't have any more stuff.
[48:04.21]Okay, hey kid, a new tournament of Miko's Bid Wars just started.
[48:07.05]Let's go to the bridge storage and win this.
[48:09.01]The final round will give us tickets to Hawaii.
[48:13.19]If you find a car engine there, send it to Cousin Kevin.
[48:15.75]Okay.
[48:19.21]Barn, bridge, oh, this is auction.
[48:20.83]Alright, we're gonna auction.
[48:22.05]Cleaning station, I know, I know, hold on.
[48:27.44]Alright, let me go upgrade the cleaning station.
[48:33.15]How much do I have?
[48:34.19]195?
[48:35.55]No, no, no, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[48:36.67]I need to be able to bid on this thing.
[48:38.49]Not yet.
[48:38.79]Alright, close the shop.
[48:41.03]Everything's sold.
[48:47.13]Close the store.
[48:49.15]I know, I want to close it.
[48:49.87]Alright, well, whatever.
[48:53.97]There's nothing here to steal if anybody comes in here.
[48:55.99]Who cares?
[48:56.39]Pop left?
[48:59.28]Oh, we're closed.
[49:00.04]Okay, it already is closed.
[49:02.29]Alright, let's go.
[49:03.81]I'm ready.
[49:04.15]Don't go to the car.
[49:07.81]A car doesn't do anything.
[49:08.43]Buy one gas for 50 bucks.
[49:21.10]What?
[49:24.87]Disable the motion blur.
[49:25.85]The motion blur is disabled.
[49:27.37]Motion blur off.
[49:28.21]It's off.
[49:34.15]It's off, look.
[49:46.68]The motion blur is off.
[49:50.20]Turn on VSync.
[49:52.76]Turn off VSync.
[49:55.10]VSync, yeah, VSync's on because... Are you new to streaming?
[50:00.19]What, because I have VSync turned on?! !
[50:08.22]Alright, let me- If VSync is so- Listen, I have to ask this question because it seems like I need you to help me.
[50:17.55]If VSync is stupid and sucks and everybody turns it off, why is it in every game?
[50:24.17]Why do they just- What's the point of having it in?
[50:27.10]If every single person turns it off, why is it just enabled?
[50:32.06]People are idiots, Jerma.
[50:33.44]Don't listen.
[50:38.58]You set him off.
[50:39.24]Somebody set him off.
[50:40.98]Somebody set him off.
[50:41.66]He's one of these streamers that you jump into and like, oh my god, he can go off on like a rant.
[50:45.68]And he just goes.
[50:47.54]Oh, it's so funny.
[50:48.50]I love watching him when he goes off about like fucking Nintendo and like Nickelodeon.
[50:53.01]No, I'm not a go-off streamer.
[50:54.61]I'm a realistic streamer, okay?
[50:56.79]There's a difference.
[50:58.19]I'm being realistic with you.
[50:59.45]I'm not going off.
[51:02.47]I'm being realistic.
[51:03.33]I'm just gonna buy the gas, whatever.
[51:12.41]That's two gas to go here!
[51:13.59]What the fuck?
[51:30.62]E-sync... You gave a pretty good answer, probably.
[51:38.92]Okay, so we have to bid on one of these, like Storage Wars?
[51:44.68]Do I get to go?
[51:52.83]Why can't you just say me?
[51:55.55]That's gonna be your thing.
[51:56.69]Alright.
[51:59.09]So where do we start?
[52:16.72]Is this us?
[52:18.44]You're living back with your uncle.
[52:22.56]That's some... I don't... What?
[52:25.92]Are you ready to lose, kid?
[52:27.29]Gonna smoke oil live.
[52:34.61]Okay.
[52:44.13]I'm ready.
[52:45.33]Miko is the real face of America.
[52:50.75]Let's go.
[52:51.27]Let's open it.
[52:52.17]Just let me in.
[52:52.95]Can I go in there?
[52:53.55]Just let me in it.
[52:54.47]Let me inside.
[53:02.19]Just open it and let me see what's in there.
[53:04.27]How do I start this?
[53:05.49]Travel to bridge storage.
[53:06.70]Look for a car engine.
[53:10.70]Oh, okay.
[53:12.10]Let's go.
[53:15.93]$600.
[53:15.95]I owe you.
[53:16.79]Kick their eggs.
[53:18.75]Alright, here we go.
[53:22.19]I... $150.
[53:22.31]$125 up here.
[53:23.05]$300.
[53:23.11]Oh, it's mine.
[53:23.59]$300.
[53:23.79]$350.
[53:23.81]$450. $450.
[53:49.59]That's probably really loud.
[53:51.21]I'm sorry.
[53:51.53]What the fuck?
[53:52.19]600.
[53:52.27]Destiny will teach you.
[54:12.68]This is 600 bucks.
[54:14.68]Yup is copyrighted?
[54:16.68]I forgot that was me.
[54:18.60]Wait.
[54:19.37]Yup is copyrighted.
[54:20.73]Is that... I can imagine that being on a t-shirt.
[54:24.25]Like, yup is on a shirt.
[54:29.07]It definitely is.
[54:30.85]If it exists, I'm gonna get it.
[54:31.91]And I'm gonna wear it on stream one day.
[54:35.16]Alright.
[54:36.18]I won the auction.
[54:36.90]That was 600 bucks.
[54:43.05]What have we got in here?
[54:44.15]Oh, let's take a look around.
[54:47.89]Hmm.
[54:52.85]Do people actually do this?
[55:04.88]So, you have a storage unit and you like, you just like don't go, do you just default on the payments?
[55:18.89]So could you go to the auction and just like pretend like you knew what was in there?
[55:30.84]You don't?
[55:31.80]Yes.
[55:35.33]Like what if I went to the auction and I like knew what was already in here?
[55:39.41]And I, what if I just told people what was in here?
[55:44.43]There's the car engine.
[55:48.17]Why would you pretend?
[55:48.95]I don't know, because you can just be like... Just discourage people from wanting to bid on it?
[55:53.60]Alright, here we go.
[55:56.62]Let's start the bidding.
[55:57.96]Yep, $100.
[55:58.78]You're at your own auction.
[56:02.55]Just wait for it to get to like $1,500 fucking bucks.
[56:07.45]I think there's something good in there.
[56:12.95]900.
[56:13.61]Yep.
[56:14.29]1,000.
[56:14.89]910.
[56:15.19]950.
[56:15.21]980.
[56:15.43]Yep.
[56:16.63]And then you can just take off the fucking mask.
[56:18.63]You take off like the glasses with the mustache and go, this is my shit in here.
[56:23.90]Guess what?
[56:24.66]It's like old shit from my grandmother's house.
[56:26.70]It's worth probably $50.
[56:27.82]And then leave.
[56:28.76]There's like two rocking chairs in here that they're missing legs and they're not worth anything.
[56:41.93]You just spent a thousand extra dollars than you had to.
[56:47.28]You know what I would do?
[56:48.10]You know what I would do?
[56:49.28]You know what I would do?
[56:50.18]This is what I would do if I ever had one of these.
[56:52.00]And I would just get a shitload of like baseball cards.
[56:56.32]Like I'm talking like 50,000 packs of baseball cards.
[57:00.50]I know they're worthless.
[57:01.59]There's nothing worthwhile in them.
[57:03.77]I would just stuff it with fucking baseball cards.
[57:06.57]So they would spend months going through these.
[57:13.21]knowing that like, wait a minute, look at all these baseball cards.
[57:15.43]There's probably a wicked expensive one.
[57:17.11]And I know that there's not.
[57:25.49]That's evil?
[57:26.04]What do you mean that's evil?
[57:28.24]This is my storage unit.
[57:29.94]This is my stuff in here.
[57:35.18]Maybe I was a collector of a bunch of shitty baseball cards.
[57:39.23]What is that your business?
[57:40.49]This is my unit.
[57:41.95]This is literally my unit.
[57:43.69]I can put whatever I want in here.
[57:48.49]What is he talking about?
[57:59.66]Look, do you not understand what we're doing here?
[58:03.50]This is somebody's storage unit.
[58:07.20]You can put whatever you want in here.
[58:08.32]Is this a little tire?
[58:12.58]Buy an axe?
[58:17.01]This thing goes down.
[58:18.89]That's kind of weird.
[58:19.53]Can I get in here?
[58:28.98]Why is there a car down here?
[58:37.63]Oh, wait a minute.
[58:38.81]I got it.
[58:39.13]Okay.
[58:39.67]Now turn it on.
[58:44.53]Oh, shit.
[58:45.31]Okay.
[58:46.49]Did I just get a car?
[58:50.31]Oh, my God.
[58:50.95]There's expensive stuff down here.
[59:04.26]What's this stuff?
[59:04.82]Gunmetal?
[59:06.30]Gunmetal?
[59:10.32]Ooh, what's that?
[59:13.68]It's 150 bucks!
[59:14.04]Fine, actually you can smash the boxes sometimes, there's stuff in them.
[59:19.71]Oh!
[59:19.77]Mine is 150 bucks!
[59:24.45]This is a car!
[59:41.41]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[59:43.51]Radio.
[59:45.09]Oh, shit.
[59:45.96]Look at this.
[59:48.02]Well, this is worth spending $600 for this.
[59:50.24]There's a big-ass storage bin.
[59:58.84]Yeah, you could probably live down here.
[60:01.08]Is this another layer?
[60:03.09]Why is this so big?
[60:05.25]Whoa.
[60:06.65]Cool.
[60:13.59]Like a bike thing?
[60:15.52]Hold on, get us out of the way.
[60:20.77]Are there any more Saw games coming up?
[60:23.99]I'm going to tell you, unfortunately, no.
[60:26.19]Considering they made two games.
[60:29.05]Both of them were absolute atrocious.
[60:32.83]They were awful, horrendous video games.
[60:36.11]Nobody with four brain cells that had any sort of capital, working capital, would have given money to make a third one.
[60:51.05]Well, it's just going to be there.
[60:58.05]Oh, there's another... How do I collapse this?
[61:07.99]When has a shitty game ever stopped you?
[61:09.57]Saw 2 did.
[61:10.53]Saw 2 was awful.
[61:11.41]Was that blood?
[61:12.89]What the fuck?
[61:20.62]I do need that axe.
[61:21.62]You're right.
[61:31.36]You just sucked at Saw 2.
[61:34.33]I don't know.
[61:35.13]I have this opinion that if you're gonna defend the video game Saw 2... You got it at Christmas one year.
[61:42.85]And like, your friend got Mario Odyssey.
[61:45.01]Or Mario Galaxy.
[61:46.41]And like, you just have to find a way to make it like that is not that bad.
[62:00.46]Stream a saw stream, huh?
[62:04.41]My best tool.
[62:05.25]This is the engine.
[62:10.89]There's so much stuff here.
[62:13.01]When are you gonna play... What is it?
[62:19.50]We get sawed to as a Christmas present.
[62:24.24]That's true.
[62:25.14]I don't know who would be giving Saw 2 to their kids.
[62:28.42]That's a pretty bad parenting.
[62:30.00]Yeah, I don't know why that would happen.
[62:34.06]In fact, you probably, people would probably be like, wait, you got Saw?
[62:38.96]Wait a minute, is that the game where you can like, where people get their heads chopped off?
[62:43.67]Yeah.
[62:45.45]Oh my god.
[62:56.58]Ooh, can I sell the couch?
[62:57.58]Get the frog, please.
[63:02.22]I'm going to get the frog.
[63:02.88]What do you think?
[63:03.24]I'm not going to pick up the frog?
[63:07.61]What was the fart for?
[63:08.45]Is it because I hit crouch?
[63:15.28]Give me a break.
[63:16.70]This is actually a fart button.
[63:22.22]Oh my god.
[63:31.55]Uh, I mean, take this TV.
[63:45.31]Aaron!
[63:46.27]Aaron!
[63:46.69]No, don't do that.
[63:54.23]Fart.
[63:54.61]Funny.
[63:55.01]Fart.
[63:55.41]Funny.
[63:55.67]Alright, I can leave.
[64:03.39]Ah, suckers.
[64:05.07]It was $2,000 worth of stuff in there.
[64:09.45]Well done there, barn finder.
[64:10.73]See you next time.
[64:11.45]Bye.
[64:22.67]We could have put it in the trunk.
[64:24.09]Oh.
[64:24.53]Get the axe.
[64:27.14]I don't have the axe.
[64:27.76]I have to buy it.
[64:28.66]I don't have enough money to buy it.
[64:29.96]Isn't it like 500 bucks?
[64:41.10]He's gonna miss every single toilet roll.
[64:42.74]I don't know what that means.
[64:43.76]Okay.
[64:50.28]Now, let's get that item that I was supposed to do.
[64:55.79]430 bucks.
[64:56.57]I'll take it.
[64:57.03]The new cyberpunk is looking good.
[64:59.65]Why is this cyberpunk?
[65:05.67]I don't know what that means.
[65:06.77]Cyberpunk?
[65:11.76]We gotta... When are you gonna do Resident Evil 8?
[65:13.91]Uh, the plan is... Well, I was supposed to do Fable.
[65:16.51]Shit.
[65:17.81]Um, Resident Evil... I wanna do Resident Evil... Oh, fuck.
[65:20.70]What do I do here?
[65:21.58]Um, hold on.
[65:22.62]Let me figure this out.
[65:25.14]Resident Evil 8.
[65:26.92]Not Resident Evil 8.
[65:27.60]Whatever.
[65:27.82]Resident Evil Village.
[65:29.38]I want to play that game next weekend.
[65:31.88]Saturday and Sunday.
[65:33.24]So that's going to be a Saturday-Sunday stream.
[65:35.91]I'm still working on the iPad stream.
[65:37.99]Which that's going to happen too.
[65:39.73]And then Fate.
[65:40.23]Yeah.
[65:40.69]We have the next three weeks blocked out.
[65:44.13]Resident Evil Village.
[65:45.85]I'm going to beat it next weekend.
[65:48.48]And then the weekend after that.
[65:51.20]Uh, either Fable 2 or iPad Insanity Stream.
[65:54.89]And then the week after that, whatever it is.
[65:57.15]We got this.
[65:58.63]That's quality video content over the next three, four weeks.
[66:05.93]When is Catboy?
[66:07.71]You don't have a release date on Catboy.
[66:09.60]You don't have a release date on anything.
[66:11.82]Alright, give me the axe.
[66:13.78]Probably never.
[66:21.77]Okay, let's make another big one.
[66:24.25]Yeah.
[66:27.27]So what's the difference between... Why would you get this one?
[66:31.09]Why not just get the standard one?
[66:38.90]Why would you upgrade this?
[66:42.12]How long until he tries to axe someone?
[66:49.99]Oh, you can't, so don't worry.
[66:55.61]Okay, so, uh, let's put this stuff, let's put this stuff up.
[67:07.44]What did I get?
[67:07.88]I got... Alright, the wheelbarrow.
[67:19.06]I need to repair.
[67:19.84]Oh, the cleaning station.
[67:20.98]Cleaning station, repair, and cleaning station.
[67:22.70]Right.
[67:22.90]How much does this cost to make?
[67:29.40]$358.
[67:29.54]What the fuck?
[67:37.71]Well, I'm just gonna put the tires out.
[67:40.77]On the medium shelf, right?
[67:43.03]I could put three up top.
[67:43.93]$38. $38.
[67:49.12]Press B to clean.
[67:50.38]This doesn't work.
[68:00.74]I remember, I also have this stock market game thing to play today, too.
[68:09.00]If you were not here for pre-stream, I had a little bit of a problem.
[68:15.34]Why can I not put this?
[68:16.82]What?
[68:20.42]Oh, there we go.
[68:21.82]Uh, the problem was, I did a poll to see what people would rather see, this or this stock market game.
[68:29.46]And it was like 50-50.
[68:30.38]It was really close for a long time.
[68:32.94]And then somebody boughted the poll.
[68:35.90]And it was, ruined everything.
[68:37.92]And then somebody boughted the boughted poll to fix it.
[68:42.04]Um, does the internet, don't, the internet, nothing on the internet is fucking real, by the way.
[68:46.06]Can we just, just be aware of that.
[68:52.28]How can you trust anything?
[69:01.94]When you're online and you see people talking to each other, those could just be two fucking bots talking to each other to get a response from you.
[69:13.97]You could just be surrounded by fucking bots and have no idea what's going on.
[69:17.67]You could be literally surrounded by them right now.
[69:34.47]The streamer admits most of his audience are bots.
[69:38.21]I have no idea who any of you are.
[69:43.33]Half of you could be pets at the houses that you live in.
[69:47.70]That have somehow pressed the right combinations of buttons to do emote.
[69:51.04]I don't know.
[69:51.40]I have no idea.
[69:54.90]You like left your computer on and your cat walked over your keyboard.
[70:00.02]You might not even actually be here.
[70:12.46]How do I... Is this a medium?
[70:14.34]Oh, I need a medium shelf.

[71:17.45]Yeah, it's a large item.
[71:19.13]Yeah, you're right.
[71:19.79]Just get rid of it.
[71:25.47]Is this the imposter is sus guy?
[71:27.52]You know, I have to answer that question probably every stream now until I quit.
[71:36.70]Oh, is this not a big item?
[71:39.70]This is a big item.
[71:40.90]I don't get it.
[71:42.32]Hang it?
[71:45.10]I don't understand.
[71:45.96]It's big, so why won't it... Oh, because it's dirty.

[73:10.18]Okay.
[73:19.50]This isn't worth the time.
[73:20.58]What?
[73:21.50]I got it right.
[73:22.16]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[73:23.32]I got it correct twice.
[73:26.86]No, that Sims character just... That dick was treating this Sim like shit.
[73:32.19]And they went out with like zero energy, zero comfort, zero bladder, and zero hunger.
[73:39.25]And they just got fucking furious for no reason.
[73:41.22]I didn't do anything.
[73:42.28]Treat your Sims better.
[73:43.20]Alright, what am I doing?
[73:46.54]Video.
[73:50.02]Turn off V-Sync.
[73:52.06]Before everybody freaks out.
[73:56.77]Is audio too loud?
[73:59.15]How loud is the audio?
[74:01.31]I feel like the sounds are fucking really loud in my ears.
[74:12.02]Now it's too quiet?
[74:13.38]No, but this looks awful without V-Sync.
[74:15.46]Oh!
[74:17.66]Are you guys seeing this?
[74:18.56]This looks horrible.
[74:22.51]This looks really bad.
[74:23.37]It's an alien.
[74:23.75]I think you can do better than that.
[74:27.99]Okay, sell it.
[74:36.98]I'm getting tons.
[74:38.00]I'm getting an insane amount of screen tearing.
[74:39.92]It's going to make me throw up.
[74:42.02]Are you guys not seeing that?
[74:48.28]I have to put the V-Sync back on.
[74:50.89]This is really, really awful looking.
[74:52.40]I have to.
[74:52.78]I'm sorry.
[74:53.68]I'm going to get sick right now.
[74:56.56]I don't think it's going through my program here.

[76:48.74]I love that sound so much.
[76:50.10]I can't stop doing it.

[81:41.05]Stop saying Aaron.
[81:43.03]Stop doing that.

[81:47.19]Like, what are you doing?
[81:48.09]Why are you... I don't know why you're still doing this.

[82:48.51]I can't do that.
[82:49.25]Let's go and find this squirrel.
[82:55.55]Please explain the Aaron thing to me.
[82:57.09]Alright.
[82:58.45]I'm going to explain this one more time.
[83:01.93]No, I don't even need to explain it.
[83:03.63]Why would I explain it?
[83:04.63]There's no reason to explain it.
[83:05.75]I need gas.
[83:15.16]It's just like, I, I, there's not, I can't even, there's nothing for me to explain.
[83:18.96]I thought that was gonna explode and kill me.
[83:35.35]Please explain it.
[83:36.07]Is this, can I dig in here?
[83:45.29]Oh, nice.
[83:47.79]A tennis racket.
[83:48.43]Okay.
[83:56.84]Is it dirty?
[83:57.76]No, it can just go up.
[84:01.77]Explain it or suffer the consequences.
[84:03.39]What is for me to explain?
[84:04.61]It's from Attack on Titan.
[84:08.11]It's Armin very concerned about Eren.
[84:13.15]And it's like the way he says it every, like, three episodes.
[84:17.10]Every single episode.
[84:17.98]Do I need, I don't need, if you don't watch the show, how can I explain that to you?
[84:40.55]You watch it dubbed.
[84:47.37]Yes, I do.
[84:48.21]Oh!
[84:50.18]He watches a show dubbed.
[84:53.18]He doesn't watch it in subs.
[84:56.04]Listen, I have such a hard time paying attention that
[85:01.15]Reading while watching a show is hard for me to do because I can't pay attention to what's actually going on on the screen.
[85:07.62]I'm too busy reading the text at the bottom.
[85:10.40]So I'm just kind of reading and not watching.
[85:13.36]That's it.
[85:13.84]I know the subs are probably a million times better, but it doesn't matter.
[85:22.26]For me, it's like if you had the book of the show you were watching, and you were reading the book at the same time that the show was being played, at the same point in the story.
[85:37.00]Like, looking down, reading, like you're reading the same dialogue, look up.
[85:39.78]Okay, that's happening.
[85:40.48]Read down, look down, read the same dialogue, look up.
[85:43.10]It's like just reading the book while the show is happening.
[85:45.76]I can't do it.
[85:46.20]My brain is not smart enough.
[85:56.53]That's a bad analogy.
[85:57.39]No, it's not.
[85:58.29]Because I'm literally reading what's happening on the screen.
[86:08.13]Alright, let's go.
[86:08.85]I'm going to buy the other gas.
[86:09.73]Are we almost at the two hour mark?
[86:14.08]Is it time to play Stalks game?
[86:19.36]Ah, quiet woods.
[86:33.99]You're watching a play and you're reading the script.
[86:37.31]Yeah, it's the same kind of difference.
[86:45.68]Is the Stalks game Invisible Hand?
[86:47.22]Yes.
[86:49.30]Saw it pop up today.
[86:50.60]I was like, oh, what the hell is this?
[87:01.81]Clean your keyboard?
[87:02.45]My keyboard's pretty clean, actually.
[87:07.78]Watch out, Youngin, there's this... I don't even know what you said.
[87:20.98]The actors are reading straight from the subtitles.
[87:26.43]Yeah, oh, okay.
[87:30.19]They're reading the script.
[87:35.66]They're reading the subtitles.
[87:37.10]Can you imagine if they just had their eyes down, like looking on the bottom of the screen, reading?
[87:42.91]Like the actual animated characters.
[87:44.73]Hmm-hmm.
[88:03.12]Agent, I'm detecting strong paranormal waves here.
[88:08.62]I'm detecting strong paranormal waves.
[88:11.68]Okay.
[88:15.84]Austin Powers joke.
[88:20.72]Did that happen in Austin Powers?
[88:21.96]They read the subtitles?
[88:31.21]That was like scary noises.
[88:35.25]Oh, it's a Miko console.
[88:36.69]I remember in the woods that night.
[88:51.75]This is worth $260!
[88:52.09]$260! $260!
[89:01.16]Anytime my grandmother... That just scared the shit out of me.
[89:03.80]Okay.
[89:05.04]Anytime my grandmother heard a price for anything, didn't matter what it was, she would always say the price again.
[89:11.58]Very, very shocked and confused.
[89:13.06]It doesn't matter what it was.
[89:14.92]How much is that thing?
[89:16.18]How much is that coffee?
[89:17.90]It was $4.30.
[89:18.09]$4.30?
[89:18.13]Yes.
[89:18.23]$60? $60?
[89:34.56]Is that a coffee machine?
[89:38.06]And anytime that I would be in trouble, if something was potentially going to go wrong, and it looked like that I might be in trouble.
[89:52.22]She would say, I don't know.
[89:53.82]I don't want that.
[89:56.12]She would say, Aaron!
[89:59.56]Jeremy!
[90:00.22]Aaron!
[90:00.79]Aaron!
[90:02.92]It was bad.
[90:03.34]That was not funny.
[90:03.94]I'm sorry.
[90:04.52]That was not funny, but it was relevant to what we were talking about.
[90:06.80]I'm sorry.
[90:07.30]Somebody said it in chat, and I just repeated it.
[90:08.70]That was not funny.
[90:10.31]That was really not funny at all.
[90:12.35]That was the worst joke ever, I think.
[90:13.67]That was not even close to being even remotely funny to any of you.
[90:22.25]Stop the errand.
[90:23.11]I'm going to do... Okay.
[90:26.59]Hold on a second.
[91:12.15]Oh shit, what happened?
[91:13.85]Did you guys not hear anything I said?
[91:16.73]I've just been talking this whole time.
[91:18.15]Anyways, what was I saying?
[91:20.91]Right, oh, so.
[91:24.20]I need that.
[91:26.58]I did not know, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to do that.
[91:28.84]What was the last thing I said?
[91:35.81]You've ruined the peace and quiet.
[91:41.48]Resident Evil 8 is so scary.
[91:44.16]I'm so glad I'm not actually playing that right now.
[92:00.33]I'm in such a jumpy mood at the moment.
[92:09.33]Alright.
[92:09.53]We're going to do a poll.
[92:10.27]Okay.
[92:15.57]We're going to do a poll.
[92:16.45]Is chicken flying over here?
[92:20.44]Okay.
[92:35.41]Interesting.
[92:37.69]Alright, next week, do you want to see me play through Fable 2 or Resident Evil Village?
[92:44.62]Which one?
[92:46.58]And you better get the answer right because we're not changing it.
[92:48.56]Okay.
[93:00.41]Let me put a poll up.
[93:01.45]Let me do this right now.
[93:08.26]Let's draw Paul dot me.
[93:17.63]Okay.

[93:30.70]This is for next weekend.
[93:33.18]And this will be a multi-day stream.
[93:35.74]Is it going to be Saturday, Sunday?
[93:37.84]Either one of these.
[93:38.32]I'm going to put it in there.
[93:41.96]Here it comes.
[93:42.72]Please, if you would, vote on this poll.
[93:55.25]Do a Twitch poll.
[93:56.99]Oh, well.
[94:01.21]We'll see.
[94:03.23]I'm not sure you can finish Village in two days.
[94:04.94]I've heard it's less than 10 hours.
[94:07.10]I've heard it's like 8 to 12 hours.
[94:08.36]We can do that in two days.
[94:19.99]Mods can just do a Twitch poll really quick.
[94:22.59]Um...
[94:24.50]Oh, yeah.
[94:24.88]Oh, yeah.
[94:25.18]Yeah.
[94:25.38]Alright.
[94:25.68]Don't click on that one.
[94:26.50]We're going to do a Twitch poll.
[94:27.96]Yeah.
[94:29.00]People can fucking game that one.
[94:31.24]Do a Twitch poll.
[94:32.30]Next week, Resident Evil Village or Fable 2?
[94:40.81]Somebody boughted the fuck out of that thing.
[94:42.57]Yeah.
[94:42.95]No.
[94:43.11]We're not playing around with that one.
[94:44.51]Okay.
[94:49.53]I need to find string for this.
[95:00.07]You didn't like the result?
[95:00.99]I didn't even look at the result.
[95:01.93]I don't even know what the results were.
[95:05.30]Why?
[95:06.24]Why is it in the game?
[95:13.72]What should Jerma play next weekend?
[95:15.14]Alright, let's see.
[95:15.70]What do you guys want?
[95:18.49]I'm happy with either one of those outcomes.
[95:26.45]I did see something weird.
[95:33.43]Where else can I go?
[95:33.99]Can I go this way?
[95:37.95]I hear The Simpsons intro.
[95:50.50]Up there.
[95:50.74]Can I get up there?
[95:58.62]How do I get up there?
[96:00.34]Oh, what the hell?
[96:00.90]How do I get that?
[96:10.44]Oh, there we go.
[96:10.96]Alright.
[96:12.14]It's a golden toilet paper.
[96:13.42]The thing that somebody was talking about.
[96:16.76]We found a golden paper.
[96:17.88]Okay.
[96:22.71]What is that?
[96:23.03]Is that money?
[96:23.95]Table 2 will happen anyway.
[96:32.13]I mean, they both will probably happen anyway.
[96:33.45]It's just, what do you want to see next weekend?
[96:40.21]Can I dig?
[96:40.53]I gotta be able to dig here, right?
[96:51.15]No?
[96:55.96]Resident Evil's gonna be MonkaS.
[96:57.04]Yeah, I mean, I've played pretty much all the recent Resident Evil games on this stream.
[97:04.08]So, I'm gonna play it.
[97:11.97]A toilet?
[97:13.61]Alright.
[97:19.92]Agent.
[97:20.48]What are you doing here?
[97:21.12]Play on the hardest difficulty.
[97:26.42]I don't play on hard difficulties.
[97:29.70]Not anymore.
[97:30.18]The only thing you're ever going to see me do that's hard is like if Elden Ring ever comes out.
[97:37.48]Which I have no idea when that's going to happen.
[97:53.35]I'll be waiting for that one for a very long time.
[97:56.11]Okay, so where else can I go?
[97:59.57]Here's the car.
[98:02.41]Holy shit, okay.
[98:05.16]Couldn't handle Nicktoons Baseball.
[98:08.54]Nicktoons Baseball is not the same as... Like playing Resident Evil.
[98:18.52]Resident Evil Village has won, okay.
[98:20.03]Okay.
[98:23.32]I need this, like, whatever this wheel is.
[98:35.29]Alright, well, I'm playing Resident Evil Village next weekend.
[98:39.92]Saturday, Sunday.
[98:44.44]Where is everything?
[98:45.38]There's only this one house, but I can't get up there.
[98:47.42]I need to get up here.
[98:55.68]I guess I do have a bias to Reese's.
[98:57.10]They're probably the best chocolate candy.
[99:00.17]Imagine actually thinking that something is unironically better than Reese's.
[99:05.67]Just standard, regular Reese's.
[99:06.85]Well, Reese's eggs.
[99:07.55]Let's make that clear.
[99:08.21]Fuck.
[99:22.54]I need to get in this house.
[99:24.56]I'm so confused as to where to go.
[99:32.24]Half the items are still here, but I can't... I need to find something.
[99:39.47]The cats are pretty good.
[99:40.41]Yeah, there are.
[99:41.21]This is the second house.
[99:42.41]Oh, fuck.
[99:43.03]Wait, this is the second house?
[99:50.24]Oh, it is the second house.
[99:51.04]I thought it was the same house.
[100:01.17]Chocolate's the devil's candy.
[100:05.70]Um, chocolate's good for you though.
[100:07.52]You know chocolate improves your mood?
[100:21.40]Yeah, am I getting question marks for actual analytical science?
[100:27.81]Chocolate is supposed to improve your mood.
[100:34.42]You guys don't you guys don't actual bad opinions Chocolate is supposed to scientifically improve your mood It has mood improving compounds And I didn't just make that up somebody somebody else made that up and I've read it and I'm repeating it to you So you can think it's real now.
[101:00.05]I don't know.
[101:00.59]That's what I've heard.
[101:01.31]I
[101:08.64]It's suedo science.
[101:09.68]It's not!
[101:10.42]It's... So does heroin.
[101:18.16]You don't even know what you're talking about.
[101:19.68]It's a PC, CD-ROM, computer.
[101:34.67]Alright, still no...
[101:40.01]A study done by Hershey's You're fucking full of shit Chocolate Improving mood Chocolate improves memory Chocolate improves mood
[102:02.07]Scholarly articles for chocolate improving mood.
[102:03.97]Dark chocolate stimulates the production of endorphins, chemicals in the brain that create feelings of pleasure.
[102:08.63]Dark chocolate also contains serotonin, an antidepressant that can elevate mood, says Scritchfield.
[102:15.82]In addition to feeling good, this is what happens to your body when you eat chocolate.
[102:19.24]That's a study done by a medical scientist.
[102:23.20]Why is chocolate good for mood?
[102:25.99]Dark chocolate and cocoa contain an amino acid called tryptophan that your brain uses to produce the neurotransmitter serotonin, which can increase feelings of overall happiness.
[102:34.48]Serotonin is the feel-good chemical and influences your mood.
[102:37.72]Okay?
[102:39.68]Self-published, not peer-reviewed.
[102:41.84]No, it is peer-reviewed because when I eat chocolate, I feel fucking great.
[102:44.80]How many times do you eat a piece of chocolate and you go like, oh, oh my god, decadence.
[102:51.28]Oh, and you feel happy.
[102:52.99]It's real.
[102:53.51]It's a fucking real study.
[102:54.43]I don't even need to study.
[102:58.05]When I take a bite into the middle of a Reese's egg, I just, oh, I just disappear.
[103:03.16]And I go into my couch and I sit down.
[103:05.68]I put my legs up on the couch.
[103:07.52]I take a big bite and my lips go around it.
[103:09.84]And then it goes, it like transitions into my brain.
[103:12.47]And there's like, I'm on like a cloud, like floating around.
[103:14.67]And it's like talking about how rich and delicious it is.
[103:18.45]And I'm, I think I'm describing a commercial that I watched for like Dove chocolate bars.
[103:22.64]But you get the idea.
[103:23.36]It's the same thing.
[103:35.62]Alright, I got the key to the house.
[103:45.54]Those were edibles.
[103:48.14]No, they weren't.
[103:51.08]Ooh.
[103:53.29]Oh, shortcut.
[103:54.93]Who cares?
[104:03.59]What is... Dove chocolate?
[104:07.38]You ever had like a Dove chocolate bar?
[104:12.20]Like the Dove chocolate ice creams?
[104:17.84]Dove chocolate.
[104:18.60]What are you guys talking about?
[104:19.40]Not shampoo.
[104:20.16]Why are you guys making me feel like I'm insane?
[104:22.60]Dove chocolate.
[104:27.38]Yes, this is a real different Dove, not soap.
[104:35.44]Okay, I got the key.
[104:37.78]What was this?
[104:39.39]There was a locked door somewhere.
[104:40.37]What was it?
[104:41.87]Right here, right?
[104:42.35]Oh, shit.
[104:46.77]Oh!
[104:49.59]Oh!
[104:50.19]Oh!
[104:54.67]Single Google searches?
[104:58.65]I have a key for the second house, I think.
[105:01.24]Is this for the second house?
[105:02.10]Stop eating soap.
[105:11.71]The chocolate is so good.
[105:12.71]Yeah, I know.
[105:13.65]The person's sitting on the couch.
[105:15.51]They're in pajamas.
[105:16.25]They take one bite.
[105:17.13]And it zooms into their face.
[105:19.07]And then it goes to like a part where they're like on a cloud.
[105:21.89]And they're floating around.
[105:26.11]And then it shows them how relaxed they are up in the clouds.
[105:28.93]And then it comes back.
[105:29.98]And they have like the chocolate.
[105:30.90]And they just have this big smile while they're sitting on the couch.
[105:32.74]Alright, let's go.
[105:46.76]Alright, found it.
[105:54.81]Still items here.
[105:55.81]Toaster.
[106:00.28]Microwave or whatever it is.
[106:02.32]I've been brainwashed by big chocolates.
[106:09.57]You know what's also interesting to think about?
[106:12.11]So, back like 60 or 70 years ago, they would do commercials.
[106:17.88]Like, I'm sure a lot of people know this already, but cigarettes were seen as not a big deal at all.
[106:23.10]They were seen as like a healthy snack.
[106:26.11]There was a commercial I remember watching where it was like a doctor writing a note about how, like, I think, Chester, what was the name of the company?
[106:35.43]Chesterfield cigarettes are the healthiest of all the cigarettes.
[106:38.39]They don't produce any throat irritation.
[106:41.82]It was a doctor sitting there writing a note, talking, it was like a doctor's note about how they were healthy.
[106:48.06]And it made me think about, people like 50, 60 years ago thought like cigarettes were just like fun like candy that didn't hurt you.
[106:55.04]What are we eating now?
[106:56.32]What are we doing now that, like, a hundred years from now, people are going to watch old YouTube ads for, like, some product and go, holy fucking shit, they were eating this all the time?
[107:05.64]They thought this was fine?
[107:09.09]What's wrong?
[107:09.65]What?
[107:09.87]Are they insane?
[107:10.97]I wonder what that thing is going to be.
[107:14.61]Where it's like, it is unbelievable to think that we were eating this.
[107:23.77]Chocolate, fast food.
[107:26.70]Sugar?
[107:27.76]I don't think it's going to be sugar.
[107:29.04]Because sugar is like... Sugar has a function.
[107:34.53]It's like one of the most... It's like the building block of a ton of things.
[107:38.77]Everybody already knows sugar is really not good for you at all.
[107:41.89]We already know that.
[107:43.41]People thought cigarettes were fine.
[107:45.52]And they're like horrendous for you.
[107:48.72]What's the thing that we all think is fine right now or good?
[107:51.52]And we're like, no, that's perfectly fine.
[107:55.10]But it's not at all.
[108:01.25]Oil?
[108:01.71]Like vegetable oil?
[108:02.57]Hmm.
[108:07.69]Probably microplastics?
[108:11.27]Interesting.
[108:15.62]Did I even use the key?
[108:16.42]I don't know.
[108:16.78]What do I even care?
[108:19.00]I got the golden paper.
[108:27.29]It's gonna be like the fake sugars, like stevia?
[108:31.60]You know, actually, I would not be surprised.
[108:33.23]Like, I don't know, something about that, right?
[108:36.11]It's like, wait, okay.
[108:37.83]What if like a hundred years from now, it's like, wait, they were making fake sugar?
[108:43.95]Garlic?
[108:45.61]Hmm.
[108:46.35]Now that would be very sad.
[108:52.30]Caffeine?
[108:53.18]I could see caffeine having some kind of, like, wow, I can't believe they were doing that.
[108:59.40]Garlic.
[108:59.90]Oh, man.
[109:00.28]Imagine if it was garlic.
[109:01.14]That would be sad.
[109:01.72]Because we think garlic is wicked healthy for you.
[109:03.92]And there's, like, studies about it.
[109:05.79]I've seen a doctor write a note about garlic before.
[109:07.69]Uh-oh.
[109:13.59]Uh, I want another big one here.
[109:20.91]These old cigarette commercials, they're so fascinating.
[109:22.93]I recommend you go watch them.
[109:25.53]They used to say that, like, having the filter on a cigarette, like, filtered cigarettes filter out all the disgusting stuff.
[109:30.22]It filters out the tar, so you get a clean, smooth drag.
[109:34.70]Those things don't even do anything.
[109:41.98]The invention of the filter cigarette was such a huge advertising thing.
[109:50.17]Clean smoke, yeah.
[109:51.29]105. 105.
[110:00.29]Anything dirty?
[110:00.79]Ooh.
[110:05.09]Do I need to wash it?
[110:06.41]No.
[110:12.17]I can't watch a cigarette commercial.
[110:13.51]I'm not 18 yet.
[110:21.19]What are you doing here?
[110:23.81]You had to click the button that said you were of a mature audience to watch this stream.
[110:27.00]What are you talking about?
[110:29.14]Why are you here?
[110:35.41]Oh, you're in big trouble.
[110:42.67]Uh, 155.
[110:43.09]This thing's 380.
[110:44.85]180.
[110:44.87]465.
[110:45.80]I gotta repair it, though.
[110:48.98]Okay, we'll put this one up.
[110:51.18]Remember, you aren't mature.
[110:54.96]Yes, I am.
[111:01.49]Look, I can make fucking Attack on Titan voices in the shower and be mature.
[111:06.71]just a little odd.
[111:07.50]Okay.
[111:23.73]That's 100% false?
[111:25.62]Okay, so you can't have... You can't have like a humoristic outlook on things.
[111:33.02]And like just be having fun.
[111:35.26]But I guess you... Can't be mature adult.
[111:40.39]What?
[111:47.53]Mature is not caring what people think.
[111:51.31]No, it's not.
[111:53.35]Say it, please.
[111:53.97]I beg you.
[111:54.63]Alright.
[111:56.83]Do a poll right now.
[111:57.97]Do a poll in chat if people want to hear Armin Arlet.
[112:04.74]The question is, do you want to hear Armin?
[112:12.29]It's a very simple yes or no question.
[112:14.11]By the way, it needs to be at least 75% yes for me to do it.
[112:29.60]I can't see it, so someone's going to have to relay what it says.
[112:31.70]Wait, hold on.
[112:46.27]77%.
[112:46.35]Yeah, but it's not done yet.
[112:50.20]That needs to stay over 75% until this is done.
[113:01.42]Think of how loud and annoying it's going to be.
[113:03.78]You're going to have to turn your volume down.
[113:06.19]Some of you, I'm trying to get you to change your answer.
[113:08.95]It's going to be like, oh, he's doing the Aaron thing.
[113:11.13]I have to turn my volume down because it's so fucking annoying.
[113:15.85]I hate when he does this.
[113:16.87]You know, even if like 2% of you guys decided to change your vote right now.
[113:21.08]Think about it.
[113:21.48]It's going to be loud.
[113:23.04]It's not funny.
[113:23.86]You don't think it's funny.
[113:25.00]You hate it.
[113:26.46]So switch your vote over.
[113:27.82]Like it's not, you don't like it.
[113:30.59]Don't make yourself hear something you don't want to hear.
[113:32.23]Hey, yeah, I mean, like, see?
[113:44.10]Think about it.
[113:45.26]Think about, I'm looking out for you, your well-being.
[113:47.50]76, come on.
[114:00.57]We need to hold.
[114:01.61]No, you don't.
[114:02.49]You need to... Hold the door.
[114:06.59]Holy shit, that's ancient.
[114:11.02]That is an ancient reference.
[114:12.94]I feel like that was a hundred years ago.
[114:14.46]Hold the door?
[114:15.30]Hold the door.
[114:17.54]Alright, I got all my stuff here.
[114:24.52]I'm gonna go to bed.
[114:28.62]This has got to run out.
[114:29.60]I don't- close it early.
[114:31.06]This has to run out.
[114:39.66]Oh, come on.
[114:49.39]Oh, man.
[114:49.77]Oh, I hate that sound.
[114:51.13]That sound sucks.
[114:59.44]I can't believe this many of you guys are clicking on this.
[115:02.35]That's shocking to me.
[115:12.03]It's got to be, remember I said over 75%.
[115:13.77]If it's 75%, it's not happening.
[115:14.87]Oh, fuck.
[115:16.79]Okay.
[115:16.91]Okay.
[115:33.59]Okay.
[115:34.67]Hold on.
[115:35.33]Let me... Wait, wait.
[115:36.14]I'll do it in a second.
[115:46.62]I thought this was a person.
[115:48.16]I was about to talk to them.
[115:50.91]Alright, alright.
[115:51.79]You get what you get.
[115:52.87]See, when I have to do it, I don't want to.
[116:00.17]I can only do it when I want to do it.
[116:06.45]Aaron!
[116:07.09]Aaron!
[116:08.19]Aaron!
[116:08.93]Run away!
[116:09.61]Aaron!
[116:10.00]Aaron!
[116:10.84]Aaron!
[116:12.22]Aaron!
[116:12.66]Aaron!
[116:19.48]Aaron!
[116:20.72]Aaron!
[116:21.06]Okay, there you go.
[116:24.73]I know, you said shut up.
[116:26.59]You must be one of the two.
[116:27.55]You should have voted no.
[116:28.91]Why did you want me to do that?
[116:30.27]76% of you told me to do that.
[116:35.03]I told you I didn't want to do it, and I told you I didn't want it.
[116:39.10]And you made that happen.
[116:40.32]It was almost all of you.
[116:42.10]It was almost all of you.
[116:44.72]That's most of you.
[116:51.48]You lost 500 viewers.
[116:55.53]Of course I did.
[116:56.41]I would have left the stream.
[116:59.09]If I saw that yes came through, I would have been like, well, I'm going to come back in five minutes.
[117:05.08]I would have just left.
[117:05.92]Yeah.
[117:07.21]They'll be back in five minutes.
[117:20.31]Now do the Aaron impression.
[117:21.65]Oh, that's easy.
[117:22.17]Just go, Titan.
[117:24.11]I'll do that one for free.
[117:26.11]Titan.
[117:27.69]Oh, it's too bad he turned into... He turned... He's... I'm Aaron.
[117:33.24]It's too bad that there are Titans.
[117:35.50]Done.
[117:36.76]Did you see those Titans?
[117:38.86]Titan.
[117:42.80]Yeah.
[117:43.06]Uh-huh.
[117:58.63]every character on this show.
[118:07.22]I'm not gonna do every character on the show.
[118:10.63]That's not how this works.
[118:14.37]Do Mikasa.
[118:15.61]No.
[118:25.47]Armin!
[118:26.45]Armin!
[118:27.47]Armin!
[118:28.57]Eren!
[118:29.89]Eren!
[118:30.97]There, that's as best as I can do.
[118:39.59]Eren!
[118:46.55]Do Hercule!
[118:47.71]Oh, I can do that one!
[118:49.37]I love that character in Attack on Titan!
[118:52.59]I love when that character shows up and says, I am the strongest person on Earth.
[118:57.06]What do you know about that one, Goku?
[119:02.20]Eren, Eren, Eren.
[119:05.58]Oh, God darn it, Eren.
[119:07.56]Eren, run away, Eren.
[119:09.21]Run away, Goku.
[119:13.85]I didn't even have a haggle.
[119:14.97]I just sold it.
[119:25.38]Do a poll about Goku.
[119:26.72]What are you talking about?
[119:37.23]Kenny from South Park.
[119:38.41]Okay.
[119:39.37]That was so easy.
[119:40.13]How dare you give me something so simple?
[119:55.20]I got 2,600 bucks.
[119:56.72]I think I sold everything.
[119:58.30]I did.
[119:59.14]Close this door.
[120:06.93]Dude, Jimmy Stewart.
[120:08.41]Well, Jimmy Stewart.
[120:10.59]What are you thinking there?
[120:12.60]Get down from there.
[120:13.98]Stop, Jimmy Stewart.
[120:26.51]I'd like to have a tenth of you that know who that is.
[120:29.35]I'm not doing it fresh.
[120:34.47]What are you supposed to Goku for?
[120:35.93]I just did it.
[120:37.13]I already did that.
[120:53.56]I want a super lockpick.
[120:55.68]Yep.
[120:56.90]Yup.
[120:57.36]Goku, but you have to- I don't know what that means.
[121:05.06]I'm not gonna do the Mr. Satan, like, Hercule impression.
[121:09.39]Goku, Goku.
[121:18.11]What?
[121:26.79]$380 for this clock.
[121:27.11]$250 plus dollars.
[121:27.55]Alright, let's go.
[121:28.09]Bus guy.
[121:56.54]This is what happens when... I'm so glad I got to do Aaron, though.
[122:02.34]Aaron!
[122:03.64]Aaron!
[122:09.59]It's been two hours, Jeremy.
[122:11.29]Well, hold on.
[122:19.69]Is this an auction for this house?
[122:20.93]I only have $580. $580.
[122:28.14]Glad to see you again.
[122:28.84]Mary would be proud.
[122:29.70]Zoe, this is to buy the house?
[122:33.36]Morty?
[122:36.12]Are they doing another season of Rick and Morty?
[122:39.07]I'm like asking.
[122:40.15]I don't care.
[122:40.93]It's just stupid.
[122:42.23]Like Reddit humor.
[122:43.01]When's the next season coming up?
[122:58.07]Don't tell him.
[122:58.83]Tell me.
[122:59.77]I'll just look it up.
[123:00.91]It's not a hard thing to do.
[123:02.17]Ooh.
[123:11.58]Can I move this?
[123:14.14]Looks like I can dig there, right?
[123:15.10]What the hell?
[123:23.59]Alright, I only have $595.
[123:28.00]I need more money for this.
[123:30.56]This is not good.
[123:32.30]I bought too much stuff.
[123:33.90]I can't buy this.
[123:34.97]What happens if I don't get this?
[123:36.97]Can I come back later and auction it again?
[123:38.47]I just don't get it.
[123:48.86]It's gonna be way more than 600 bucks.
[123:50.88]I just spent all the money to come here though.
[123:53.60]Can I go in the other houses?
[123:57.64]Next game?
[123:58.06]Not yet.
[123:58.44]I'm not finished with barn finders.
[124:14.72]Why does everybody want me to do the impressions of the stuff that everybody hates?
[124:23.14]I think you secretly like Rick and Morty, and you want me to do Morty because you like the character Morty.
[124:27.11]You think it's funny.
[124:39.03]In fact, I would bet a certain amount of cash that most of you... Well, I don't know about most of you.
[124:45.75]A lot of you probably actually really like that show.
[124:49.21]And you're just pretending to not like it.
[124:53.55]I bet you a bunch of you actually really like it.
[124:55.19]I think it's funny.
[125:05.70]Probably, yeah.
[125:06.44]First two seasons, maybe.
[125:09.44]What is a funny show that's right now?
[125:11.12]I think, have I asked this before?
[125:12.18]What do you, what is the collective, like, Twitch chat hive mind opinion on what's a currently airing good show that's funny, that's really funny?
[125:27.98]Sopranos has not aired in like 15 years.
[125:30.42]Probably Aaron.
[125:33.48]Currently Aaron.
[125:35.50]Invincible is actually a good show.
[125:37.18]Is it?
[125:40.43]Okay.
[125:41.05]I want everybody to remember this.
[125:43.57]I want you all to remember this.
[125:45.55]Clip this.
[125:46.75]And in like two or three years, I want to see if like everybody hates that show now.
[125:56.35]Okay.
[125:56.49]Okay.
[125:58.24]Remind me in like three years if like everybody thinks the show's not funny.
[126:05.22]Because it looks like of all of you, most of you are saying it is.
[126:10.68]Is dipping sauce?
[126:11.42]Yeah, just wait for the dipping sauce episode.
[126:22.25]Young Sheldon.
[126:26.59]Uh, I have to, like, I have to try to get this.
[126:29.71]Whatever.
[126:30.09]I'm gonna lose it, though.
[126:31.15]I'm gonna try.
[126:35.24]Whatever.
[126:35.50]Let's go.
[126:38.32]Just wait till the last second to do a $50 bid.
[126:39.78]Wait.
[126:39.88]$450. $450.
[126:57.37]There's so many people here and nobody's bidding.
[127:00.99]Why would you come to the auction?
[127:03.63]Did I just get this house for $450?
[127:05.09]I did.
[127:11.04]Why did you even show up?
[127:12.44]Oh, god damn it.
[127:16.02]Fuck.
[127:17.24]No!
[127:17.58]No!
[127:20.44]What do you mean?
[127:49.41]I can't do this level now.
[127:51.69]I just wasted a bunch of money.
[128:00.16]The secret is to let them bid and then come into the last second.
[128:03.34]No, the secret is to go to the auction.
[128:06.28]Go there kind of late and disheveled because something just happened.
[128:10.25]Crazy.
[128:11.79]And you sort of irritate everybody in the room.
[128:13.71]You sit down.
[128:14.41]You're like, oh, sorry, sorry about that.
[128:16.27]And then your character ends up sneezing.
[128:19.61]like three-fourths of the way, like about maybe two-thirds of the way through the auction.
[128:24.18]And they see that as a bid.
[128:27.06]And it's like, oh my God, that's so much money.
[128:29.76]I can't believe, what the heck?
[128:31.16]Oh my God, it's sold to the man in the funny hat.
[128:34.03]And then I have to pay like $5 million because I didn't mean to bid.
[128:38.27]That's what you meant to say.
[128:54.63]happen no this is every this is it I don't have the clock that happens in every TV show that has an auction one of the characters like sneezes and they they put their hand up accidentally somehow
[129:19.58]That's Mr. Bean.
[129:20.34]Yeah, it's in every TV show that's ever had an auction.
[129:22.44]If you have an auction in your show, the main character is going to accidentally do something and raise their hand and have to buy, like, the $20 million painting.
[129:33.83]Can I even continue to play the game?
[129:35.29]I have to, like, go to sleep.
[129:50.19]This guy loves slapstick comedy.
[129:51.91]I do.
[129:52.23]I really do.
[129:57.74]He still wants me to go to Aunt Mary's house.
[130:08.16]I don't have any items.
[130:11.95]Did I get softlocked?
[130:19.16]We need to go back to the red barn and find items, right?
[130:22.93]Yeah, it's free.
[130:29.03]Where's our gift subs, Jeremy?
[130:30.22]You owe us.
[130:33.98]How do I owe gift subs?
[130:37.32]From what?
[130:37.62]What are you talking about?
[130:47.36]500 million.
[130:48.68]And I'm slowly shaving off that number.
[130:52.74]It's not going to be an accurate number.
[130:53.78]Yeah, I decided to pay with fun tokens.
[131:08.49]I guess that that was okay.
[131:09.83]Okay.
[131:23.38]I have now.
[131:26.66]No.
[131:29.82]No, I'm not going to.
[131:33.03]Problem?
[131:34.65]Is there a problem there?
[131:40.99]One errand is $10 from the debt.
[131:44.99]No, that wouldn't be worth it.
[131:46.07]It would have to be like a million.
[132:02.56]What is T-F?
[132:04.02]T-F problem.
[132:05.62]T-F.
[132:07.82]Does it mean the fuck?
[132:10.06]Like the fuck.
[132:11.88]T-F.
[132:12.22]What is T-F?
[132:12.76]There's something on top here.
[132:21.41]How do I get up there?
[132:24.33]Troll face.
[132:25.33]Oh, okay.
[132:29.23]Can I get on the roof?
[132:31.32]I gotta get on the roof.
[132:43.50]You don't have BT... Yes, I do.
[132:45.86]I just don't have it through, like, the Streamlabs thing.
[132:50.52]Yes, I still use Streamlabs OBS.
[132:52.24]I know.
[132:53.68]Didn't I just tell you that I have a cord that hasn't worked in, like, four years and I still haven't replaced it?
[132:59.29]I want every item.
[133:17.85]Slobs is so much easier to use.
[133:19.41]I understand that.
[133:20.41]Well, theoretically, I love Streamlabs OBS, but in practice, I hate it.
[133:28.82]Having the chat baked into the window here is the only reason why I still use it.
[133:34.76]It's such a good feature.
[133:43.66]Okay.
[133:44.56]I need to get some items.
[133:45.45]Come on.
[133:48.98]Saving window space and monitor space is huge.
[133:53.22]I'll give them credit where I'm gonna give them credit.
[133:55.90]I hate every single thing else about the entire program.
[134:00.52]Is it?
[134:02.14]I have nothing else to say.
[134:02.94]That's the thing about streaming software.
[134:18.96]There's no streaming to a service.
[134:23.60]Nobody has really made... There's like three products that do it.
[134:34.55]And I've tried some of the other alternatives, and they were just a huge pain in the ass.
[134:42.29]Is that funny?
[134:42.90]You got it.
[134:46.72]Uh, let's see.
[134:47.90]What would make you in particular laugh?
[134:53.46]I don't know.
[134:53.72]I don't know what you think is funny.
[134:55.78]See, anytime you guys say, say something funny, what you don't understand is I don't know what you think is funny.
[135:01.03]I don't know what your favorite routine is here.
[135:03.69]So if I try to say something that I think you might think is funny and you don't, you didn't like that particular routine, then it's not going to be funny.
[135:13.06]So I can't help you.
[135:15.95]You just have to watch until you see something that you like.
[135:22.71]If you don't like what you see, and, you know, goodbye.
[135:27.27]See ya.
[135:28.45]My hands are so sweaty I can't snap.
[135:29.87]Hold on.
[135:32.25]And, you know, goodbye.
[135:33.77]Can I jump from here?
[135:38.91]There's got to be a way I can get over there.
[135:46.80]On top of this tower.
[135:51.36]Scream directly into the mic for several seconds.
[136:05.73]No, that sucks.
[136:08.63]I don't want to do that.
[136:09.56]That's not, that sucks.
[136:16.30]I gotta get on this roof.
[136:24.24]That's definitely how I do it.
[136:25.10]Alright, I'm up here.
[136:31.08]And go here.
[136:32.04]Alright, I got the golden... Alright, I got the golden paper.
[136:36.60]How much is that worth?
[136:42.15]Where is this other item?
[136:44.41]There's another item that's worth a lot of money, apparently.
[136:52.87]I don't see any items.
[136:55.07]I can't walk.
[136:59.07]What the hell is going on?
[137:02.27]I can't walk.
[137:02.77]I'm trying to walk.
[137:03.57]Whoa, that was weird.
[137:04.14]Alright, fine.
[137:07.16]I'll scream into the mic.
[137:07.88]Ah!
[137:08.70]Ah!
[137:23.89]Where's this other item?
[137:32.26]There's one or two significant items that are still here.
[137:35.02]That's making me annoyed that I can't find them.
[137:46.78]Whatever, I got enough.
[137:48.74]That was so cringy.
[137:53.80]Yeah, there's something about that, the fake screaming, that, ugh, it just does something, I agree.
[137:58.60]Oh, they're buried, shit.
[138:16.54]Parents are asleep.
[138:28.56]Dermot, do a fart.
[138:29.38]Okay, fine.
[138:34.68]Let me repair the thing to make some money.
[138:36.06]Where's the repair machine?
[138:39.22]Is this cleaning?
[138:41.82]Is this the generator?
[138:45.52]Where's the repair station?
[138:51.23]I can't believe you guys think that's funny.
[138:58.67]Oh, there it is.
[139:02.65]Okay.
[139:02.91]800 bucks.
[139:03.21]God damn it.
[139:03.71]Alright.
[139:03.91]Well, I can sell some stuff.
[139:07.09]I will sell.
[139:10.16]I should have enough to at least make $800 and repair all that stuff and then bring it back.
[139:16.22]Okay.
[139:22.32]I have a few wheelbarrows.
[139:26.83]That's all I can sell.
[139:34.54]I can't put anything else up there.
[139:35.96]Even if they're puzzle pieces, I can't sell them?
[139:47.80]Well, I should make like 300 bucks.
[139:49.18]I think.
[139:55.65]Hmm.
[139:59.41]Alright, get to 800, build a repair station, and then repair all that stuff and sell it and do another day.
[140:03.81]Alright, and then I'm gonna buy the house.
[140:04.81]Alright, and then we're gonna play a stock game, okay?
[140:07.28]Sound good to you?
[140:09.06]Sounds good to me.
[140:22.42]Did you watch the sub or the dub of King of the Hill?
[140:26.28]I watched the, uh, sub.
[140:33.87]Alright, Sal, hurry up.
[140:43.44]Remember, my brother's watching.
[140:44.38]Can you make him laugh?
[140:45.14]He likes Mario.
[140:46.72]Sure.
[140:46.96]Did he just, like, clap and scream?
[140:58.16]I hope he did.
[141:16.44]Remember he's 24 so I would have clapped and screamed if I heard that and I was a big Mario fan Customer
[141:34.12]No, I don't, there's no, I didn't see an alien.
[141:44.45]Come on.
[141:45.97]I need 130 bucks.
[141:46.31]100, 100, 100.
[141:46.41]No, okay, that's fine.
[141:47.63]That puts me at 937, good.
[141:48.93]Close the shop, repair station, go.
[142:05.44]Alright.
[142:06.98]Allows you to repair broken items.
[142:08.04]Broken items have the hammer icon.
[142:09.42]Fix damaged spots using the resources from the smashing the junk with the axe.
[142:12.85]I don't... I read that so wrong.
[142:14.39]Okay.
[142:18.73]Now I can refill the shop, go to sleep, do it again.
[142:29.18]Yeah, just look at this.
[142:30.72]$465?
[142:30.86]Are you kidding me?
[142:31.68]That's so much money.
[142:33.42]I'll be able to buy that damn house.
[142:37.01]I'll get it.
[142:41.73]Okay.
[142:44.19]On the damage to... Oh, I said do it really fast.
[143:01.19]Okay.
[143:01.29]Okay.
[143:07.94]Is that it?
[143:18.15]Got it.
[143:19.49]Nice.
[143:19.75]Alright, sell this thing for 500 bucks at least.
[143:29.18]There.
[143:30.44]I got a lot of repairable items.
[143:35.46]It's all television.
[143:37.03]Television, that's better.
[143:45.37]Get over here.
[143:48.86]Good.
[143:52.38]I have so many, um, tools.
[144:04.59]Or is there something unfunny?
[144:08.68]I don't know.
[144:09.52]Maybe 20-30% of everything I've said this stream.
[144:11.96]I don't think I need to say anything more.
[144:13.40]I think you could probably pull something.
[144:18.40]What's that?
[144:21.64]An old chair?
[144:22.20]That's not 90%.
[144:27.02]It's probably like 30%.
[144:33.90]It's like 20.
[144:46.12]I'll make a... I'm gonna make... I'm gonna get that house.
[144:50.79]I'm getting invested in this game.
[144:52.77]Even though I don't... I'm not, but I am.
[145:04.13]The thing with the spring goes on the wall.
[145:06.56]I tried to put it there.
[145:07.24]It didn't do anything.
[145:14.52]You ready for this one?
[145:15.10]Look at how fast that was.
[145:21.97]Check this out.
[145:33.34]Ignore chat.
[145:35.64]I'm not really ignoring them, but I'm not paying that much attention to them at the moment.
[145:39.09]It's not a bad thing.
[145:40.95]I'm just trying to get my store ready to sell objects.
[145:48.49]Alright, somebody said put this on the wall.
[145:54.06]I tried to do that before.
[145:54.94]It didn't do anything.
[145:55.56]Alright, sleep.
[145:56.74]Wake up.
[145:57.28]Open this door.
[145:59.02]Done.
[146:01.74]Yeah, that's it.
[146:02.18]I don't have anything else.
[146:05.39]I'm going to make probably $2,000 and then I'm going to go buy the house.
[146:09.31]And after the house has been purchased, go in there and wait, I can't sleep.
[146:13.75]It's too early.
[146:14.41]Can I open the store?
[146:20.91]Oh shit.
[146:21.33]Okay.
[146:28.64]Customers.
[146:36.26]Thank you.
[146:42.13]I'll take it.
[146:42.49]Did you find any alien stuff?
[146:47.57]I found the aliens themselves.
[146:50.77]I drank the moonshine and they do weird stuff in front of me.
[146:57.51]Get rid of that.
[146:59.25]Sweet.
[147:01.71]This actually is kind of cool.
[147:02.83]I would probably want this.
[147:04.83]This would be kind of cool to have like in your, out in your front door or something.
[147:16.33]In, in a, in like your study.
[147:18.61]Alright.
[147:20.43]Yeah.
[147:20.65]I want you to take that.
[147:21.43]Is it a hundred and... I'll do it one more time.
[147:29.62]Nice.
[147:33.76]You.
[147:34.96]This thing's expensive.
[147:36.06]Make up your mind next time.
[147:36.92]What are you talking about?
[147:38.22]I just talked to you.
[147:38.94]What?
[147:39.10]It's because I walked away?
[147:48.83]I didn't mean to.
[147:49.31]Maybe you flashlight on?
[147:54.72]Oh.
[147:55.08]Whoops.
[147:55.22]500 bucks.
[147:57.94]Do it twice.
[147:59.42]Again.
[148:06.98]Yeah, that's a huge hit right there.
[148:08.96]That's $675.
[148:09.64]There's no way I get to open up that house next time.
[148:22.41]Come on, somebody get it.
[148:28.44]Oh!
[148:29.16]Again.
[148:29.50]Again.
[148:37.34]Yeah.
[148:39.94]$674.
[148:40.18]I am now ready to go bid.
[148:52.37]You want that bear?
[148:53.20]Alright.
[148:55.24]Let's go.
[148:55.60]Travel.
[148:57.00]I got money.
[149:14.54]Jirama Goku day is trending.
[149:18.14]Goku?
[149:23.00]T-pose.
[149:23.87]I'm glad we got to see it.
[149:24.69]Alright.
[149:30.41]2,000 bucks.
[149:30.81]Let's go.
[149:33.01]I'm not gonna do any bids until the last second.
[149:44.60]Where's the time left?
[149:54.81]Just wait.
[149:58.05]Hold on, alright.
[149:59.03]Here I come.
[149:59.59]8.50.
[150:01.45]Hold on.
[150:05.97]Alright, I'm coming in.
[150:06.59]I'm coming in 9.50.
[150:08.13]Burn in hell is what I said.
[150:10.01]What the fuck?
[150:10.63]How is this more expensive than last time?
[150:14.73]1350.
[150:17.81]That's it.
[150:18.19]No one's going to go more than that.
[150:19.65]What the fuck?
[150:20.93]No.
[150:22.75]1550?
[150:22.77]1750.
[150:24.37]The last time the house went for half of this.
[150:30.83]That's it.
[150:31.37]Give it to me.
[150:31.71]1750.
[150:36.88]I got it.
[150:40.06]That's way over what I didn't want to buy that much, but it's mine.
[150:43.72]Whatever.
[150:50.70]Let's get a haul here.
[150:51.99]What do you say?
[150:53.15]Yep!
[151:04.69]Just because you say yep does not mean it was a good deal.
[151:17.20]You're gonna get sued.
[151:18.10]Alright, because I said yep.
[151:26.67]Yep.
[151:28.01]Ooh, what's this?
[151:33.09]I'll take it.
[151:40.56]It's trademarked.
[151:41.26]You know what else is trademarked?
[151:42.58]Probably like the... Yahoo!
[151:44.42]Wahoo!
[151:45.14]And I do that every other day.
[151:46.12]I do that like once a week to you guys.
[151:47.65]And I'm still fine.
[151:56.29]Can't dig?
[152:16.92]See what I'm saying?
[152:17.56]Yep.
[152:17.70]Yep.
[152:25.97]Now I'm gonna be saying that in the shower.
[152:27.39]That's my new thing, I think.
[152:28.47]That probably is gonna be my new thing.
[152:38.11]Can we get a doi doi doi?
[152:40.33]No.
[152:41.23]No.
[152:41.53]I can't just be, like, the guy that just does fucking three jokes.
[152:44.35]I don't wanna do that.
[152:48.75]I already repeat myself so much.
[152:50.25]You want me to do that more?
[152:51.95]I don't want to do that more.
[152:58.09]I know I do that already.
[152:59.96]I don't want to add to that.
[153:06.72]Can I pick this lock?
[153:12.34]How do I pick the lock?
[153:16.12]I have a three star lock pick.
[153:18.12]How do I use it?
[153:24.61]Oh, well, I don't know.
[153:37.10]Face cam where I break my desk.
[153:40.02]Well, I know Ikea has some good ones for your replacement.
[153:47.23]Ooh, this one's expensive.
[153:57.36]Okay, what about this one?
[153:59.10]Lockpick.
[153:59.88]Why is this scary?
[154:01.37]Move up pins in correct order to open lock.
[154:07.93]I did it?
[154:08.93]I guess I did it.
[154:09.47]Ooh, computer.
[154:20.64]Computer.
[154:23.11]Lemon white?
[154:24.33]Unsellable.
[154:25.07]Oh, wait!
[154:25.51]I have the, uh... I have the monitor.
[154:29.76]I have the monitor, the tower, and now the mouse.
[154:32.48]Maybe I'll be able to sell it.
[154:33.16]There's a dog photo.
[154:48.00]That's it for a huge dresser like this?
[155:00.45]There's a dick on the wall.
[155:01.99]There might be.
[155:02.57]There probably is.
[155:03.05]I don't really... I don't care, though.
[155:12.92]Still a lot of shit left here.
[155:13.96]Alright.
[155:14.16]What about downstairs?
[155:14.82]Shit.
[155:32.31]There's a car under there.
[155:36.00]Car.
[155:37.76]That's gonna sell for quite a lot.
[155:40.30]I would assume so.
[155:51.43]Nothing in any of these.
[155:57.38]Whistle while you work.
[155:59.24]Whistle while you work.
[156:01.16]Whistle while you, whistle while you, whistle while you work.
[156:05.98]Whistle while you work.
[156:07.86]Whistle while you work.
[156:09.86]Whistle while you, whistle while you, whistle while you work.
[156:13.98]Oops.
[156:24.02]Ooh, that's a big one.
[156:32.81]Megaphone.
[156:37.98]Give me that.
[156:45.27]Get the trumpet.
[156:46.13]I did, didn't I?
[156:47.15]Yeah, I got it.
[156:52.69]Alright.
[156:52.89]What about this thing?
[156:54.14]The road toaster.
[156:56.06]I'll take it.
[157:03.24]Whoa.
[157:09.77]I don't have a key to get in here.
[157:10.95]Where would the key be?
[157:11.83]No, it doesn't matter.
[157:12.45]It's just in the backyard.
[157:16.55]Hmm.
[157:19.31]Hmm.
[157:23.30]Stop doing that.
[157:25.38]Stop.
[157:25.76]Hangar on the back, right?
[157:37.39]I can't go back here?
[157:39.81]Where's this key?
[157:51.39]Key.
[157:55.18]Key?
[157:55.40]I don't see a key.
[157:57.84]Is there a key?
[158:17.91]Check the mailbox.
[158:19.59]That's not a bad idea.
[158:20.45]Wait.
[158:21.49]Alright.
[158:21.85]That did something.
[158:25.01]Oh, shit.
[158:27.59]What is this?
[158:36.04]Oh, my God.
[158:36.54]That was a statue of Michelangelo.
[158:40.44]I didn't want to break it.
[158:41.28]I wanted to pick it up.
[158:48.50]There's no key in here.
[158:53.25]God damn it.
[159:00.27]I want that key.
[159:01.07]I haven't found the clock.
[159:11.20]Go check the mailbox.
[159:14.08]Alright, I'll check the mailbox.
[159:19.14]I can't leave without the object.
[159:52.47]Can't go in the backyard unless I have the key.
[159:58.15]Am I missing it in the garage or something?
[160:03.39]Where is this thing?
[160:04.93]What about the shovel?
[160:05.83]Yeah!
[160:06.35]Is there a place to dig?
[160:15.69]Go into the Twin Peaks room.
[160:18.48]Did you just spoil the show?
[160:19.50]Did you just spoil the show for me?
[160:20.84]I have Twin Peaks, like the show Twin Peaks.
[160:23.38]So now when I watch Twin Peaks, there's going to be a room like that.
[160:26.06]And I'm going to know exactly, and I'm going to be ready for it.
[160:27.62]I'm going to be waiting for that fucking room with the red curtains.
[160:30.62]Thanks a lot.
[160:31.54]Thank you.
[160:38.38]I can't watch Twin Peaks now.
[160:41.34]Thanks a lot.
[160:42.14]Un-fucking-believable.
[160:44.61]You have no idea how much that pisses me off.
[160:48.55]That was all my list of shows to watch eventually.
[160:53.01]You know, I have that as well as the new Alvin and the Chipmunks 3D cartoon.
[160:58.35]They're desperately trying to make Alvin and the Chipmunks something that people want to watch by making them like little kids.
[161:04.46]They're not even chipmunks anymore.
[161:05.56]They're like as big as small children.
[161:07.12]And they have like people faces.
[161:10.42]Both the movies sucked.
[161:12.22]I don't think anybody cared.
[161:13.42]Nobody watched either one of those movies.
[161:15.26]They did horribly at the box office, I think.
[161:16.86]And they were very, very poorly rated.
[161:19.15]We have to have like a show on Nickelodeon about them.
[161:24.16]I can't think of anything else.
[161:25.50]I can't think of anyone that watches that show.
[161:30.50]Like, Alvin and the Chipmunks is one of those old nostalgia things that no one cares about.
[161:38.27]And now I have to watch that show instead.
[161:40.19]Because you ruined Twin Peaks for me.
[161:41.67]Thank you.
[161:44.59]You have no idea.
[161:46.17]Alvin, the last episode that I just watched...
[161:50.22]Simon was on his computer and he had a big report due that was due for his class because they're like in school, I guess.
[161:57.58]And Simon was complaining about the professor about how, I can't do this.
[162:01.92]This is way too hard.
[162:02.58]I got to do all this code.
[162:03.88]And Alvin grabbed the computer and wrote an email to the professor saying like, Simon said this and that and that and like hit the send button.
[162:11.82]And like, he's like, yeah, he should know.
[162:13.80]And Simon's like, what are you doing?
[162:15.50]Alvin, are you crazy?
[162:16.49]I don't want him to know that.
[162:20.10]Spoilers.
[162:20.52]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[162:21.44]Spoiled.
[162:22.04]Sorry.
[162:22.62]Thanks for ruining Twin Peaks.
[162:23.72]Now you got fucking spoiled.
[162:25.42]Your show got spoiled now.
[162:46.51]I don't see any mount.
[162:48.23]Where is this key?
[163:01.97]In another house?
[163:10.40]Just a second.
[163:10.86]Can I go in either one of these?
[163:11.80]This looks like I can go in.
[163:18.64]Mobile users reacting to a bit that happened a minute ago.
[163:22.73]That does happen.
[163:25.53]Where is this key?
[163:26.73]Can I go on?
[163:27.33]Wait, can I go on the roof?
[163:46.40]I can't break this?
[163:52.04]Ah!
[164:02.55]Check that dirt thoroughly.
[164:10.53]No!
[164:25.79]What the hell is this?
[164:45.06]It's the tip of the hat's picture.
[164:57.02]Alright, where is this it's free on a hook on the wall between the windows oh My god it is up here.
[165:10.08]Oh geez Tip of the hats picture, okay, let's get to it.
[165:18.88]Oh
[165:31.16]Can't play the game because he was spoiled.
[165:32.48]Oh, that's fine.
[165:39.46]Alvin!
[165:40.46]We're the chipmunks.
[165:58.72]You think it'd be embarrassing for the people that do the chipmunk voices to have their voices like slowed down and we hear what they actually sound like?
[166:06.94]It would sound like that.
[166:07.66]It'd be like, we're the chipmunks.
[166:10.62]Alvin, Simon, and Theodore.
[166:13.84]They don't actually sound like that.
[166:14.92]Yeah, I've heard the Christmas one.
[166:30.56]I hope I get a hula hoop.
[166:35.25]I've heard it.
[166:35.89]Yeah, I'm old.
[166:37.29]Ooh, a necklace.
[166:50.58]There's still something out here.
[166:58.30]You want me to be in the next Alvin and the Chipmunks film?
[167:05.16]And why do you think they would want me in that movie?
[167:09.89]All it would take would be about 10 minutes of like a vetting process for them to see that I've talked about how stupid that show is and how awful that whole franchise is.
[167:20.59]You want that person to be in the next movie.
[167:34.60]Oh, that was fun.
[167:46.83]The sus guy is a big draw.
[167:54.39]Not really.
[167:55.23]Why do you think that carries that much weight?
[168:03.92]Can I take this?
[168:06.53]Hey, Otto, stop.
[168:09.51]He's just like digging into the ground over here.
[168:11.51]Stop it.
[168:13.59]It's funny.
[168:19.34]I don't know what this last item is, but it's the clock.
[168:21.64]It's the actual item I need.
[168:23.02]How have I not found the clock?
[168:34.21]Seems impossible.
[168:42.77]Do you guys see a giant clock somewhere?
[168:44.97]I don't.
[168:47.93]Listen for it.
[168:55.63]Seesaw.
[168:56.53]Go to the seesaw.
[169:08.28]Oh.
[169:16.11]Oh, nice.
[169:16.69]Thanks, guys.
[169:21.05]You really helped me.
[169:22.27]You know, I appreciate that.
[169:23.08]You really helped me here.
[169:23.80]So I'm going to buy that, I guess.
[169:35.81]Clock.
[169:36.01]Clock.
[169:42.19]Show auto.
[169:43.25]No, I can't show auto because then I have to show me.
[169:47.93]I don't want to show me right now.
[169:55.53]Alright, I got everything.
[169:56.71]Yeah, that's everything.
[170:02.82]Mm-hmm.
[170:03.98]Mm-hmm.
[170:04.56]Mm-hmm.
[170:07.78]Mm-hmm.
[170:08.38]Mm-hmm.
[170:12.39]I don't know why I'm doing that.
[170:18.25]What's wrong with me?
[170:27.66]I'm leaving.
[170:28.32]No, you're not.
[170:30.68]You liar.
[170:31.48]You're still here because you've been waiting for the stock game.
[170:44.56]Okay.
[170:46.30]Send this.
[170:48.34]Complete that quest.
[170:50.12]Why are you singing?
[170:51.01]I don't know.
[170:51.63]Why can I not sing?
[170:54.57]Why is it so out of the ordinary?
[170:58.33]What is this app?
[171:00.91]Comic.
[171:04.18]Oh, it's like a comic book.
[171:06.22]Oh, okay.
[171:07.84]I don't have the whole thing.
[171:13.28]Alright, I need to get stuff out here.
[171:14.92]How's the computer doing?
[171:21.33]Computer.
[171:28.02]Mouse, computer, and do I need a keyboard?
[171:31.46]Maybe a keyboard.
[171:47.36]I like... This is my favorite part.
[171:54.08]I want to play... Is that... Alright.
[171:55.18]Is that... Isn't there a power washer game now?
[171:59.21]I want to play it.
[171:59.93]Is it any good?
[172:00.73]Is the game terrible?
[172:06.07]How can I not get this?
[172:18.04]Okay, finally.
[172:18.66]Jesus.
[172:24.88]It's a power washing game.
[172:26.00]You should know if it's terrible by now.
[172:28.76]Let's play it next week.
[172:29.76]Should I play it next week?
[172:34.76]No, I'm playing Resident Evil Village next week.
[172:44.55]I'm playing Resident Evil Village.
[172:52.01]400?
[172:52.11]No.
[172:52.25]Resident Evil Village.
[172:57.51]Then Fable 2.
[173:00.05]Then... iPad stream.
[173:03.73]Then... Um... Then... Something else.
[173:20.10]I don't know.
[173:20.72]Whatever you said.
[173:29.82]Do a mini rumble between stream game choices.
[173:33.38]That's actually a really good idea.
[173:35.66]I'm going to steal that from you and use it.
[173:38.30]That sounds really funny.
[173:40.68]Maybe eventually.
[173:54.01]Megaphone.
[173:55.79]Give me that megaphone.
[174:00.59]Or whatever this thing is.
[174:01.53]A gramophone.
[174:10.97]Done?
[174:17.28]On the wall?
[174:17.72]Oh, come on.
[174:20.52]Hang it.
[174:26.10]Do not play Lisa.
[174:27.50]I'm not... Do I have to...
[174:30.76]I'm not going to play Lisa.
[174:33.84]Do I have to keep saying this?
[174:37.68]You are never going to see Lisa on this stream.
[174:40.07]It's never going to happen.
[174:41.15]Never.
[174:42.21]Ever.
[174:42.95]It's never going to happen.
[174:44.77]It's never going to air.
[174:45.97]Ever.
[174:46.63]It will never air.
[174:50.41]Ever.
[174:51.07]It's never happening.
[174:54.82]Unless I think it's good.
[174:55.78]I'm kidding.
[174:56.36]No, it's not happening.
[175:09.91]Why not?
[175:10.27]I just don't want to play it.
[175:11.09]I don't want to play it.
[175:11.67]I have a lot of items.
[175:16.89]Okay.
[175:36.13]Don't play Dragon Rampa.
[175:37.33]I'm not going to play that either, I don't think.
[175:39.41]I don't... Look.
[175:45.67]If you have a suggestion, please put it in to the suggested recommended channel on the Discord.
[175:53.33]And that's it.
[175:56.13]Thank you so much.
[175:57.45]Thank you.
[175:59.70]You want to see me play Dragon Rampa?
[176:02.52]I'm glad you do.
[176:04.91]But if I'm going to play it, it's my... I'm going to make that decision when I make that decision.
[176:08.86]Thank you.
[176:09.16]Alright.
[176:14.52]Sleep.
[176:15.14]Get up.
[176:16.28]Turn it on.
[176:30.11]I'm going to go read Homestuck.
[176:32.73]No.
[176:32.93]No.
[176:36.55]No, no.
[176:37.45]It's not that I don't... I don't have time for a big immersive series right now.
[176:53.81]Okay.
[176:54.73]Open the store.
[176:57.91]Read that email first.
[176:58.77]No, I don't have time for that.
[177:04.36]Aim?
[177:08.37]The Bid Wars.
[177:09.53]Wait, what?
[177:11.77]I want to go to the Bid Wars.
[177:12.67]Hold on, I need money first.
[177:17.06]Is Fable 2 going to be a two-part stream?
[177:19.46]It's probably going to be Saturday and Sunday.
[177:24.12]Resident Evil will be two streams, and then so will the other one.
[177:28.55]Fable 2 is going to definitely take more than one stream to do.
[177:33.44]What about the Diablo II remaster?
[177:34.90]Well, I plan on playing the Diablo II remaster on my own.
[177:38.30]I don't think I'm going to stream that.
[177:44.12]It depends.
[177:44.48]I don't think so.
[177:50.55]Resident Evil Village is like four hours.
[177:53.71]Well, if I beat Resident Evil Village quickly, then I'll just play Fable 2.
[178:03.76]I don't think this is going to happen.
[178:04.70]If a game says 4 or 5 hours, it takes me about 10.
[178:09.44]Got it.
[178:19.24]It took me about 9.
[178:20.06]Yeah, I would imagine it's like the other ones.
[178:25.45]How is it?
[178:25.95]I didn't even ask how the game is.
[178:29.33]It looks like it's getting good reviews.
[178:31.81]So Resident Evil 2, the remaster, was probably my favorite Resident Evil.
[178:35.79]It was my game of the year.
[178:41.02]How can that... Is it first person?
[178:43.54]Or is it third person?
[178:52.24]It's first person.
[178:53.28]Oh, shit.
[178:53.72]Okay.
[179:03.08]That's actually, alright, that's cool.
[179:07.80]So, it's essentially Resident Evil 7.
[179:12.59]Oh, shit.
[179:13.57]Alright, just sell.
[179:19.67]Lots of sex in the game, which won't allow it to be played.
[179:21.95]Does major TOS violations.
[179:23.59]Don't risk it.
[179:24.21]What?
[179:30.08]I mean, don't risk it.
[179:30.98]Isn't there like 100,000 people streaming that game right now?
[179:38.65]It's like almost all of Twitch is streaming that.
[179:41.79]I think they would probably... You're fine.
[179:50.62]I know I'm fine.
[179:51.84]I didn't have a... I'm fine.
[179:53.08]I'll be fine.
[179:53.52]Yeah.
[180:03.10]Don't listen to that guy.
[180:04.20]Okay.
[180:07.82]They all got banned.
[180:15.42]TOS Timmy's.
[180:23.79]You're not going to like Resident Evil 8?
[180:25.29]Don't play it.
[180:27.05]I liked Resident Evil 7.
[180:30.56]Well, I liked Resident Evil... Alien.
[180:42.05]I liked some of Resident Evil 7.
[180:43.59]I liked portions of it.
[180:46.01]The first hour... The first two hours of Resident Evil 7 was a 9 out of 10.
[180:51.34]The second, like, four hours was like a 6.
[180:54.76]Like, the last four hours was like a 2.
[180:58.54]So, I mean, I don't know how...
[181:11.87]The first, like, few hours of that game were some of the best I think they've ever done.
[181:16.63]That house was scary.
[181:18.21]That was terrifying.
[181:23.26]And then Resident Evil 2 just... Nothing can be better than Resident Evil 2's remake.
[181:29.19]It'd be hard to do.
[181:29.73]Because Resident Evil 3's remake was very much, like, very lackluster.
[181:36.36]They're going to remake Resident Evil 4.
[181:47.43]I'm really scared of that.
[181:49.01]That terrifies me.
[181:49.79]Because Resident Evil 4 is still really good.
[181:54.35]The reason to remake 2 and 3 makes sense, because they're like old tank-controlled top ta- just go, go, go, turn, turn, turn, go, go, go.
[182:04.01]Resident Evil 4 is still a great game.
[182:05.71]It doesn't really need to be remade.
[182:09.45]What do they have to, like, change?
[182:16.53]Remake 4 in first person.
[182:17.97]I don't think I would like that.
[182:19.72]I think I'd want it to be in third person.
[182:30.92]They're adding Tomato Town to Resident Evil 4.
[182:37.12]You know, there are so many Zoomers now, I wouldn't be surprised.
[182:42.26]And that would be like, okay, I guess they're adding, like, Tomato Town.
[182:51.49]There's a lot of Zoomers.
[182:52.51]I mean, and they love Tomato Town.
[183:01.95]I didn't say, uh, Tomato Town is dumb.
[183:05.43]Fortnite is dumb.
[183:06.35]Zoomer is stupid.
[183:07.25]I didn't say that.
[183:07.77]I just said Zoomers love Tomato Town.
[183:10.01]Would it be that surprising if Tomato Town was in something else that wasn't just Fortnite?
[183:15.90]R. Zoomers love Tomato Town.
[183:23.90]Alright, let's do it again.
[183:28.52]Yeah, that's a lot of money.
[183:29.86]How much is that?
[183:30.38]1,800.
[183:30.40]I don't even know what Tomato Town looks like.
[183:42.22]Alright, I got 4,200 bucks.
[183:43.50]I'm going to bid wars.
[183:46.26]Let's go.
[183:50.38]Bid wars.
[183:51.04]I have $5,000.
[183:51.56]Let's go.
[183:55.39]Bid Wars.
[184:12.21]You're missing out on Tomato Town.
[184:13.43]Beware of thieves.
[184:19.08]Why am I still playing this?
[184:20.02]Well, I'm about to stop playing this and move on to the stock game.
[184:28.02]We'll see what happens here.
[184:33.62]Are we bidding on this car?
[184:34.63]Oh, shit.
[184:38.15]We're bidding on the car.
[184:45.23]You said that an hour ago.
[184:47.39]Here you can show off your skill in a series of small auctions.
[184:49.89]The winner is the person with the most value of stuff found in storages.
[184:54.21]Winner of the bid wars get a special prize, the big machine.
[184:59.47]The most value... I have to find valuable stuff in the storage units?
[185:17.44]Hey, come on.
[185:17.99]It's... We all know what we're doing here.
[185:31.68]Limit the amount of snacks that somebody can get.
[185:34.84]Two bottles of water per person.
[185:39.17]Storage wars is staged.
[185:40.85]Is it?
[185:43.61]Oh no!
[186:00.80]I can do better than that.
[186:09.19]Only the best are invited for the bid war.
[186:10.87]What did I just do?
[186:23.64]I tried.
[186:24.02]Okay, so I have to open these?
[186:26.72]Alright, open this up.
[186:35.53]Oh shit, hold on.
[186:57.25]This doesn't make any sense.
[186:58.53]It's way too much.
[187:01.69]It doesn't make any sense.
[187:02.57]You can't get it in.
[187:05.35]Holy shit, that was perfect.
[187:06.34]Wait, what was that?
[187:07.02]Where was I?
[187:42.29]I got three.
[187:44.13]What did I get for a prize?
[187:45.55]Ooh, a can of soda.
[187:46.31]I can do better than that.
[188:06.24]Is this cheating?
[188:39.35]This is cheating.
[188:45.49]Get it!

[189:00.25]Put this away.
[189:44.84]Why do I only have 10 points?
[189:58.47]Pick up the fucking ball.
[189:59.57]Oh, it's because I'm too far.
[190:03.78]I'm not... Wait, how many points do I get if I go all the way back here?

[198:48.92]I think I brought the axe, because I wouldn't be able to even go in here.
[198:51.03]Okay, it's this thing.
[198:55.91]That's a, yep, 385.

[199:29.68]Another crossbow up top as well.
[199:32.44]This is a big ticket.
[199:34.36]This is about $1300 to $1400 bucks.
[199:35.36]$1500.
[199:35.42]I don't want to miss anything.

[200:40.15]What was that?

[201:01.97]Why even let me dig if there's nothing there?
[201:03.55]Alright.
