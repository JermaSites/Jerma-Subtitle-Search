[ve:61.1.100]

[00:38.60]hey well no we're the four horsemen okay and we no no all four horsemen are equal to the apocalypse okay
[01:55.51]Nobody can hear them.
[01:57.31]It's my fault.
[01:58.25]It's all my fault.
[01:59.23]Now they can hear you.
[02:01.05]Wow, worst POV.
[02:02.41]Honestly, it's all my fault.
[02:04.85]Professional, but we were just talking about The Sopranos, like the singers, like people who can sing soprano.
[02:11.52]Yeah.
[02:13.26]Yeah.
[02:14.46]Hello?
[02:14.74]Really high notes, like...
[02:18.13]Yeah, right.
[02:19.23]Like, I was just showing, hey Poke, I was just showing my audience this video of a supposed mushroom singing, and it made like a little song.
[02:27.22]It was like a cute little mushroom song, and then I found out it was fake.
[02:30.04]I was like really disappointed.
[02:32.98]Wait, like a real mushroom?
[02:34.06]Yeah, it was like a mushroom.
[02:36.78]I'll put it in here if you're interested, but it's fake, so it's, you know, very disappointing.
[02:44.82]That's so fucking annoying, dude.
[02:46.90]Like, why can't there be full magical singing creatures in the world?
[02:51.32]That's what I'm saying.
[02:52.56]You know, like, I watched it, and they made, like, a beautiful mushroom song, and now I'm finding out it's fake.
[02:58.12]It's just disappointing.
[03:00.09]You just linked me a YouTube video to download?
[03:02.61]No, no, no, it should just... You could just play it.
[03:06.43]No, download... You're gonna want to download this.
[03:08.77]I downloaded the video.
[03:09.45]You need to keep this, folk.
[03:10.59]It's very important.
[03:11.37]I have to extract the... Hold on.
[03:14.04]It's not a virus.
[03:15.36]I downloaded it.
[03:16.10]Okay, you're good.
[03:19.72]I was not paying attention, though.
[03:21.26]So I guess I downloaded it.
[03:23.04]Did you like it?
[03:25.74]I haven't watched it yet.
[03:26.94]Should I watch it later or now?
[03:28.29]That's just a little bit of vapor and gas.
[03:30.41]That's a little bit of vapor and gas escaping from a piece of food.
[03:32.61]I am not impressed.
[03:35.67]I know, but even that's fake.
[03:37.35]I found it was not even a mushroom song.
[03:40.91]Oh, that's fake too.
[03:42.11]We can't even have anything.
[03:44.15]What?
[03:44.77]They don't want us to have anything.
[03:46.83]Any fun.
[03:47.23]Alright, so the game.
[03:50.17]What are we doing?
[03:51.07]What are we playing?
[03:53.21]Heads up.
[03:54.05]If you weren't paying attention, this game has no volume slider.
[03:56.81]Be careful.
[03:57.85]Be careful.
[03:58.75]Great.
[04:00.13]Can't wait.
[04:00.55]Great.
[04:01.17]Looking forward to it.
[04:01.91]Great.

[04:05.13]The Headliners.
[04:06.56]This actually looks really funny.
[04:07.58]I'm really looking forward to this.
[04:09.66]yeah it's my my hometown of time square I don't live in time square but you know I'm used to the elmos there so I'm hoping we get to fight them that'd be nice I'm ready so Ster you want to give the TL;DR what the this is this is uh like what are we doing
[04:29.12]What?
[04:29.42]You were the one who read the synopsis.
[04:32.18]Why is it on me?
[04:33.02]Okay, alright.
[04:34.20]So the Headliners is a game where you take pictures.
[04:36.94]We are going to be dropped into the middle of New York.
[04:39.24]Oh, you're spoiling it!
[04:40.20]I legit don't know what it is.
[04:41.48]Alright, let's just play.
[04:43.00]Let's do it.
[04:43.46]Who wants to host a game?
[04:44.28]How are we doing this?
[04:46.66]Ster, would you be open to hosting the game session?
[04:50.98]I would do anything for you.
[04:53.26]Would you watch The Sopranos in full?
[04:56.16]I'm already in like season three.
[04:57.90]What?
[04:58.36]I knew it.
[04:58.72]I didn't know you were that far.
[05:00.96]Yeah, you got to catch up.
[05:02.04]We watched the first two episodes together and you said you were going to wait.
[05:04.96]It was one of those things where it was on my family's television 100% of the time.
[05:10.12]So I've seen every episode and like not in the right order.
[05:13.26]So I kind of, you know, I'm following along.
[05:17.38]And I love the part where Tony Soprano, he hits the explosive oil tank with the hammer and it just cuts the black.
[05:24.68]Poke, you've never seen Sopranos?
[05:31.60]I've never seen Scarface, so... I got Ster at 200%, but you're like at 40%.
[05:40.61]I have that problem with Ster too.
[05:42.37]He is a fucking loser.
[05:45.07]Wait, what?
[05:48.66]uh yeah I have uh whenever Ster and iron a call he is super low and I have to turn him way up and he is a fucking poser pokes us no no I'm gonna say the same no we played a deadlock for a while and we used to have a drama because my chair made a squeak sound and mid-game he would complain dude like you moved you did that chair readjustment thing and we would just lose because like the vibes are off
[06:11.84]And like, I'm not kidding.
[06:12.74]Every time I would play with him, I'd be self-conscious and try not to move.
[06:16.26]Like in my chair.
[06:17.16]I told you it was cool to move.
[06:19.98]No, I asked, I had to ask, can I, yo, oh fuck.
[06:22.48]I got to move for a sec.
[06:23.16]You're going to hear a squeak.
[06:25.32]It was loud though.
[06:26.90]It still happens.
[06:27.52]I could do it again right now.
[06:29.20]Yeah.
[06:29.38]Let me hear it.
[06:29.83]Alright, here we go.
[06:30.81]I kind of want to hear it.
[06:31.39]I'm going to give you guys a realistic one.
[06:33.61]Here you go.
[06:36.71]It actually doesn't happen anymore.
[06:38.67]I was going to say, if it was still squeaking, didn't you move houses and you kept the same squeaky chair and you never... I told you to put olive oil on it.
[06:46.61]Olive oil?
[06:47.07]That's a very Sopranos thing for you to say.
[06:49.01]You've been watching way too much Sopranos.
[06:51.63]Poki, is this a case of you hold down tab and you see that Ster's character is like 0 for 12 and it's just anything is going to set him off?
[07:02.51]No, no.
[07:03.55]Okay.
[07:04.45]No.

[09:30.93]How do you change the microphone?
[09:32.75]Oh, there's no way to change the audio.
[09:35.13]I hate when this happens, by the way, but on Steam settings, go to voice and then change it there and then exit game and reopen.
[09:42.27]Okay.
[09:42.59]I'll be back.
[09:46.26]So go to just like a shift tab type Steam?
[09:50.62]No, like actual Steam Steam.
[09:53.20]Okay.
[09:53.50]Yeah.
[09:53.62]And then scroll down Steam and then settings.
[09:57.04]Okay, I see voice.
[09:59.16]I see input device and I'm going to go ahead and change that.
[10:04.72]Okay.
[10:07.10]Did that make it better?
[10:07.64]Am I good?
[10:09.12]You sound good.
[10:10.12]Do I sound okay?
[10:10.68]I got to exit.

[10:22.74]Coming back.
[10:25.72]I'm coming.
[10:26.38]Hold on.
[10:30.33]Hold on.
[10:32.13]There's a dog that's going to bark here in a second.

[10:50.12]Is my problem fixed?
[10:52.38]Hello?
[10:54.94]Am I here?
[10:56.00]Is my problem good?
[10:58.41]The default guy is literally me, so I guess I'll just stick with that.
[11:01.78]I guess we're good.
[11:02.50]It's worse?
[11:03.04]What?
[11:03.22]Yeah, it's worse.
[11:04.26]How?
[11:06.98]How do you like this, though?
[11:09.00]Why would I be like this?
[11:14.75]Do you change it on Steam?
[11:16.43]Maybe it's... That's weird.
[11:17.79]Because I just... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:20.79]Yeah.
[11:24.11]Escape, go to audio.
[11:25.11]It has like a drop down that says what audio thing you want to use.
[11:28.45]Yeah, I'm using it.
[11:32.11]Okay, how's this?
[11:34.81]Is that better?
[11:36.55]Same.
[11:36.97]Testing 1, 2, 3.
[11:38.11]Testing 1, 2, 3.
[11:38.71]Testing 1, 2, 3.
[11:39.33]Testing 1, 2, 3.
[11:40.10]There you go.
[11:41.36]There's the voice chat options.
[11:45.84]I mean, I can hear you, but you're still distant.
[11:50.30]Distant?
[11:51.69]Hello?
[11:52.51]Testing 1, 2, 3.
[11:53.75]Testing 1, 2, 3.
[11:54.77]That's crazy because... Yeah, can I show this on stream?
[11:58.97]I don't think I can even show this.
[12:02.01]Oh yeah, I can.
[12:02.51]Okay.
[12:02.75]Alright, so look.
[12:06.87]See?
[12:07.07]I don't see.
[12:11.31]Testing.
[12:11.85]Hello.
[12:12.37]How are we?
[12:13.03]Are we having a good job?
[12:14.63]See?
[12:14.81]It's like perfect.
[12:16.23]It's coming back like perfectly.
[12:17.81]Maybe you have to restart.
[12:19.13]I just did.
[12:19.59]What the fuck?
[12:23.88]It's always you.
[12:24.84]What is wrong?
[12:26.62]Go to your windows and disable the mic for webcam.
[12:30.38]Oh, that's a good idea.
[12:32.93]Ster, are they shooting bullets into the sky?
[12:34.99]I think so.
[12:36.37]I think there's a Godzilla monster.
[12:37.81]Oh, right.
[12:39.71]That would make sense.
[12:40.51]Okay.
[12:42.31]I'm just going to rip out the fucking webcam.
[12:44.56]I'm going to say I kind of like it.
[12:53.05]Okay, I just unplugged the webcam.
[12:54.29]Can you guys hear me?
[12:54.97]Oh, you're good now.
[12:55.71]Yeah, you're real.
[12:56.25]You can hear me?
[12:56.61]We're good?
[12:57.59]Yeah.
[12:58.09]Yeah.
[12:58.59]Oh, perfect.
[12:59.17]Poke and Jerm, can you go to audio and just make your microphone volume a little bit louder?
[13:03.55]Dude, I had to, I was going to do webcam today.
[13:05.55]Is it better now?
[13:07.15]Uh, too loud, Poke.
[13:08.83]My bad.
[13:11.06]Uh, how, how does mine, is mine sound good now?
[13:15.42]Sounds alright.
[13:19.88]I'm like reverbed, right?
[13:22.28]Yeah.
[13:23.00]That's in the game.
[13:23.94]This, I think this self echo.
[13:25.34]Yeah.
[13:25.66]Okay.
[13:26.10]Alright.
[13:26.60]I think we're good.
[13:27.16]Are we ready to try?
[13:29.72]Wait, so this is, do you hear yourself in the game?
[13:35.39]Don't do that.
[13:40.70]Alright, I need to make my avatar.
[13:43.78]It's this one.
[13:44.42]I don't need to even look at any others.
[13:46.76]Yeah, that looks like you.
[13:48.04]Yeah, you got it.
[13:50.08]That's it, yeah.
[13:51.96]Alright, cool.
[13:52.60]Do I look funny or no?
[13:54.58]We don't have name tags.
[13:55.64]I don't even know who's who.
[13:57.20]Vinny, you can't be that one.
[13:59.12]I won't be that one.
[13:59.88]I'm going to be... Is there like a punch?
[14:05.76]Holy shit, it's Hasan.
[14:06.36]I'm going to be this guy.
[14:11.43]I mean, at least you'll know who I am.
[14:13.05]Alright, equip yourself and get on the helicopter.
[14:18.41]Alright, I got my DSLR camera.
[14:20.83]Yo, look at me.
[14:21.37]Do I make you laugh?
[14:23.33]Wait, let me see.
[14:29.14]Yep, yep.
[14:32.78]You got me.
[14:33.56]That actually got me.
[14:34.16]Alright.
[14:37.37]You look like a Sesame Street guy.
[14:38.92]I don't know.
[14:40.02]How do we use the camera?
[14:42.26]Like my friendly neighborhood.
[14:44.38]I just got points for taking a picture of you.
[14:50.91]Oh, cool.
[14:52.23]You can take selfies as well.
[14:53.83]How do you take a selfie?
[14:56.33]Press R. Right click, hold right click, and then press R. What happened to my... Oh.
[15:09.16]Alright, so I guess our goal is to take pictures of the anomalies.
[15:16.36]Dude, I rebound.
[15:17.00]Hold on, I rebound this shit.
[15:18.26]What do I make it?
[15:18.62]Alright, so we're getting in?
[15:19.28]Oh, we should make a short film!
[15:36.74]In graphics, cinematic bars.
[15:38.92]Oh, you're right.
[15:45.38]Do not waste your film.
[15:46.74]What, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what, what?
[15:48.82]Hey, Jerma, how does my head look?
[15:52.08]Dude, I don't have any pictures left.
[15:53.96]I have no photos left.
[15:55.30]I don't think, I think I have one picture left.
[15:58.10]Do not, do not, you have 10.
[16:00.60]It says when you aim it.
[16:02.06]Oh, 10.
[16:10.23]That's not good.
[16:17.83]Oh, I like your character.
[16:18.61]That was your chair, wasn't it?
[16:20.29]What?
[16:20.61]Dude, there's monsters.
[16:21.74]I heard your chair just now.
[16:23.40]No, there was supposed to be no... You guys, we're not supposed to hear anything.
[16:25.80]What?
[16:26.98]Alright, we got to get pictures of monsters.
[16:29.24]That's how this works.
[16:31.42]Yeah.
[16:32.14]Oh, how do you do it?
[16:32.62]Did you get a flashlight?
[16:33.50]How'd you do that?
[16:36.04]You just... We got it before we left.
[16:38.79]Oh, yeah, I got one.
[16:40.27]Oh man, I didn't get one.
[16:41.23]Shit.
[16:41.77]What's the noise?
[16:43.53]What's the noise?
[16:44.47]That's just New York City.
[16:46.09]But trust me, I'm here a lot.
[16:47.79]I live in New York City.
[16:49.23]I gotta make every independent film ever.
[16:54.84]Fine, we've got New York City goats.

[17:17.96]It's alright.
[17:18.56]No fall damage, cool.
[17:46.13]He's gone!

[19:22.68]He's gout-macting.
[19:23.58]Alright, so what do we... I think we get points.
[19:28.52]Maybe it talons it up at the end.
[19:32.59]I wonder if you have to lift to get the points.
[19:35.51]You might need to lift, yeah.
[19:37.63]I can't get back to the helicopter, but he's right there.
[19:42.26]You can make it if he just runs.
[19:43.48]I think if you run, you can make it, yeah.
[19:47.47]If he was a boss, he'd jump on its head.
[19:50.47]Again, this is just every day in New York City.
[19:52.29]I just, you know, you gotta run.
[19:54.93]Catch that train.
[19:56.41]He's getting a lot of pictures of whatever this thing is.
[20:01.27]That's just, that's just Howard.

[21:48.14]Uh, no, actually.
[21:50.10]That was actually fucking crazy.
[21:52.29]What are we doing with our score?
[21:53.49]I don't know.
[21:55.87]I think we just have to collectively get to 1,500 and then we can unlock the next.
[21:59.95]Yeah, I'm assuming it's like Lethal Company, right?
[22:02.45]Oh.
[22:05.06]Oh, there's a big... These are spoilers.
[22:07.72]We shouldn't be looking at these.
[22:08.89]Look, look, we got to get good photos too where like you guys got to pose in front of them with the emotes.
[22:14.71]Oh, and also selfies.
[22:18.35]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[22:18.93]Right.
[22:19.73]Fuck.
[22:19.97]Alright, we got this.
[22:22.21]I'm sorry that upset you.
[22:24.16]I keep dropping the camera.
[22:26.76]Hello.
[22:29.00]Alright, let's try this again.
[22:32.00]Hey, what's up everybody today?
[22:34.14]Yep.
[22:35.53]Alright, I'm ready.
[22:38.81]Hey, Ster, can you look behind you?
[22:43.94]Oh, never mind.
[22:44.64]Okay.
[22:46.48]His head just ripped over at me.
[22:49.16]This is a danger level one.
[22:50.46]We should be fine.
[22:52.98]You guys want to see my foot again?
[22:57.42]I don't want to see your gout.
[23:00.06]I hear shit already.
[23:01.02]You can't see it.
[23:02.13]I'm hearing something.
[23:04.73]We got to get a huge monster.
[23:05.75]We got to get a picture of a big one.
[23:07.39]Can we get a group picture at least?
[23:09.76]Yeah, who wants to take it?
[23:11.50]There's a guy running at us.
[23:12.70]What?
[23:12.82]There's a guy running.
[23:13.74]There's no one running.
[23:15.86]Wait, there is a guy running.
[23:18.14]I bet he explodes or something.
[23:19.42]I'm just going to aim it at him.
[23:23.55]I thought he was like an imposter, but no, I think he's actually just running.
[23:27.07]Alright.
[23:31.71]Okay, well, yeah, we got one.
[23:34.16]Let's go in the direction that he was running from.
[23:36.00]That's probably a very good idea.
[23:37.46]Oh, true.
[23:44.70]Is this the park where RFK left that dead bear?
[23:49.99]What's a bear?
[23:53.25]A hairy man.
[23:54.69]Oh.
[23:56.29]Yeah, probably that.
[24:01.47]Watch that battery.
[24:02.19]I don't know.
[24:06.45]Wait, Magdalene, if you can hear us, show us a sign.
[24:09.53]Polk, are you not American?
[24:11.33]I'm Canadian, but if you guys want to leave, just let me know.
[24:14.32]Oh, yeah.
[24:15.22]Quack, quack, quack, quack.
[24:16.38]Quack, quack, quack, quack, quack, quack.
[24:18.36]What was that?
[24:23.12]Show us a sign.
[24:31.45]Hey, I heard a sign.
[24:32.95]I'm going down this way.
[24:34.31]I heard a sign.
[24:37.39]Oh shit, hot dogs.
[24:38.43]How you doing?
[24:38.97]We got the long dogs.
[24:40.25]We got short dogs.
[24:41.95]We got proud.
[24:42.79]I've never had one of these hot dogs.
[24:44.31]Did they kill you?
[24:45.27]I think there's only one monster on this level.
[24:48.41]They kill you a little bit.
[24:52.42]Oh wait, you can see this popping up.
[24:55.78]There's a fellow.
[24:56.56]Howard is in the distance there.
[24:58.78]Oh, we got a person.
[25:00.92]Wait, what if we feed the person to the manhole?
[25:06.43]Oh God, they're everywhere.
[25:09.21]Was that was that who?
[25:11.18]That was nobody in the call.
[25:13.56]Monster.
[25:18.60]I ain't going up there.
[25:24.82]I think it's just this one monster on this level.
[25:29.42]He's throwing a rock at me.
[25:31.40]Oh my God, that hurt.
[25:34.13]You have to go close near him.
[25:35.17]You have to go close near him.
[25:36.45]Watch out!
[25:37.33]Watch out!
[25:39.39]You lure him over it?
[25:39.91]What?
[25:41.87]Oh, who wants to pose?
[25:42.81]Yeah.
[25:43.47]Yeah, Jerma, go up to him and dance and we'll take a picture.
[25:45.37]Get a picture of this because I'm going to get killed by whatever's in here.
[25:48.51]No, don't do it.
[25:49.27]Don't do it?
[25:57.70]Did anybody even get a picture of it?
[26:00.66]Is there anybody even here?
[26:02.16]Wait, did we both just die for no reason?
[26:03.58]You can't even...
[26:20.01]Where are you taking the picture of?
[26:21.51]Just us for the moment.
[26:23.19]Do you want to?
[26:24.19]We're almost at 1500.
[26:25.03]I think Vinny's dead.
[26:25.87]Do you want to go?
[26:27.31]I wonder if they grab our cameras.
[26:28.67]They can get our footage.
[26:29.92]I have some good footage.
[26:32.94]I got a picture of blood, limbs, gore times two.
[26:36.42]What's the most points you've taken?
[26:41.04]Oh my God.
[27:01.38]You figured it out.
[27:04.55]Oh god.
[27:16.64]You just wanted to die.
[27:18.54]You just wanted to die.
[27:19.58]It's just like, I'm just gonna let this thing kill me.
[27:22.44]That was very funny.
[27:23.18]Do we even have any pictures?
[27:25.20]Nope.
[27:25.38]Dude, Vinny, what happened to you?
[27:27.46]I did the same thing you did.
[27:29.69]And I failed.
[27:31.83]Like I was trying to get a selfie with him.
[27:33.11]That's why you were backwards.
[27:39.61]Yeah, he crushed me with a rock.
[27:40.41]I got a really good one of Jerma dying.
[27:42.65]Alright, we gotta make it.
[27:43.97]You can pick up the cameras from your friends and then you can turn those photos in.
[27:52.73]Well, then we gotta succeed at one.
[27:53.93]We didn't get any points.
[27:55.03]We need a little bit more points.
[27:56.39]Let's try as hard as I can.
[27:57.37]Everybody get loaded with awesome photos.
[28:01.21]Alright.
[28:04.43]Green doors equal get in.
[28:09.47]When you guys scroll the mouse wheel, what happens?
[28:12.85]The noise.
[28:14.65]Half life one noises.
[28:16.31]Weird, OK.
[28:16.81]OK, I think it's only those two or three monsters, so let's get some really good footage of that one kind of lumbering guy.
[28:31.07]I'm going for the big fish.
[28:32.11]That would have been a good, like, candid moment.
[28:37.11]Wait, this is our last day, right?
[28:38.71]Did we lose two games?
[28:39.37]Everybody turn around, turn around, turn around!
[28:41.29]What?
[28:44.64]Is there an emote button?
[28:47.32]How do you emote?
[28:50.02]All the one through zeros are emotes.
[28:53.30]Oh.
[28:55.79]Two survivors fleeing.
[28:57.09]That's a good photo.
[29:01.39]OK.
[29:01.53]I'm going to get some good photos this time.
[29:05.70]Watch this.
[29:07.72]Yeah, this time we're going to stay alive or if you die, I make a promise I will get your camera and turn those photos in.
[29:13.48]I fixed it guys sorry about that.
[29:15.54]Audio is moved.
[29:18.77]I'm bugging.
[29:19.87]Sound good.
[29:20.27]Yeah, I think we gotta go in the park.
[29:24.77]I think this is the tutorial.
[29:27.09]It seems like yeah, because we're Times Square is in this game.
[29:38.79]Someone pick up his camera.
[29:40.49]I got it.
[29:41.47]OK, good, good.
[29:43.39]Wait, we should get like a bunch of crazy pictures, right?
[29:47.39]I got that.
[29:47.97]I got that.
[29:54.08]Where's our friend?
[30:01.72]Well, I hear him.
[30:02.38]I hear him.
[30:09.17]Yeah, so can we go in these green ones?
[30:10.55]Was that what people were saying?
[30:12.93]Oh yeah.
[30:21.01]Kind of need a flashlight.
[30:22.73]Yeah, we don't have one.
[30:23.93]Oh God.
[30:24.67]The Mega Vista web.
[30:34.12]What?
[30:35.72]Was that a Half-Life scientist?
[30:37.72]Yeah, I think I saw someone running up top.
[30:40.38]Vinny, Vinny, Vinny, come here for a sec.
[30:42.40]Just come here alone, by the way.
[30:45.06]Yeah.
[30:48.87]It's a soundboard thing.
[30:49.83]He's a fucking asshole.
[30:51.39]There's someone upstairs.
[30:52.01]There's someone upstairs.
[30:52.67]There's someone upstairs.
[30:53.25]There's someone upstairs.
[30:53.93]Hiding survivor.
[31:00.47]What is this lady doing in here?
[31:01.71]Pizza.
[31:03.53]Pizza.
[31:07.83]Wait, maybe get me sitting and enjoying the pizza.
[31:10.75]That seems like a good picture, right?
[31:17.36]Good, got it.
[31:19.54]Very cool.
[31:27.29]I'm just doing it for the light.
[31:33.17]There's no monsters in here.
[31:37.67]What?
[31:38.01]What is she doing?
[31:45.44]Why is she being so weird?
[31:46.20]I don't know.
[31:46.50]Where is Vinny?
[31:57.44]We don't have flight flights.
[32:04.72]Stop doing the half like fucking scientist.
[32:07.49]I can't hear where he is.
[32:17.85]I got good, I got good photos on this camera.
[32:19.85]Do not leave it behind.
[32:20.71]Okay, I will make sure I get it.
[32:28.98]There's a vent.
[32:31.24]We just kind of left a Vinny.
[32:33.02]We just need to go back.
[32:34.12]We need like 20 points to do whatever the first mission was.
[32:37.28]Okay, yeah, this lady's freaking me out.
[32:39.09]I really don't like this weird sneaking she's doing behind everybody.
[32:44.19]Let's just find our way out.
[32:45.21]Yeah, let's just get out of here.
[32:45.93]Vinny's dead.
[32:48.21]Oh, fuck.
[32:49.71]Uh-huh.
[32:51.54]Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp.
[32:54.36]Stomp, stomp, stomp, stomp.
[33:01.02]Okay.
[33:04.92]I got a pick.
[33:05.95]It was an alien.
[33:06.91]It was weird.
[33:08.69]Alright, wait.
[33:09.33]We're getting out.
[33:10.05]Get out, get out, get out.
[33:10.77]We need to leave right now.
[33:14.13]Oh, he died.
[33:14.63]Alright, get his camera and let's get the fuck out of here.
[33:18.10]I got it.
[33:18.34]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[33:50.02]I thought I was dead.
[33:51.10]I thought you was too.
[33:56.80]Well, did it just hit you and then leave you?
[33:58.56]Yeah, it didn't kill me.
[33:59.38]I thought I was just instantly dead.
[34:01.02]That's why I just kind of didn't do anything.
[34:04.87]Yo, dude, there's fucking landmines inside the buildings.
[34:08.11]Are there really?
[34:09.91]That's how I died.
[34:11.50]Oh my god.
[34:12.42]Is that a different guy?
[34:16.32]That's the same guy from before, right?
[34:17.66]He has some great pictures though.
[34:19.08]We'll absolutely beat it.
[34:21.76]Oh no, that guy's different.
[34:22.56]He's fast.
[34:25.14]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[34:26.28]That's good.
[34:26.68]I'm focusing.
[34:27.26]I'm gaming here.
[34:28.00]Nice.
[34:33.40]You're not wrong though.
[34:36.36]Wow.
[34:37.40]He did it.
[34:37.80]That's crazy.
[34:39.85]Yeah, do you remember he got hit by the dog?
[34:41.71]Yeah, apparently it didn't kill me.
[34:44.33]So we have a health bar, I guess.
[34:48.35]It took like two hits to kill me.
[34:50.33]Yeah, the top left.
[34:51.07]How are we letting the guy with Groot beat us?
[34:54.12]How are we letting the guy with Groot fucking outplay us?
[34:55.80]He's got Groot.
[34:57.12]I am Groot.
[34:59.18]Alright, let's see.
[35:02.82]Top pictures, here we go.
[35:08.56]Nice.
[35:10.17]He's blinking.
[35:12.33]Oh.
[35:13.51]I took one of these too, but I died.
[35:16.69]Ooh.
[35:17.01]Wow, that one's not that good.
[35:18.17]What is that?
[35:20.71]Huh?
[35:21.71]Oh, okay.
[35:22.09]That's what killed me.
[35:26.41]That's a pretty good one.
[35:28.05]At least we survived.
[35:30.21]Yeah, we won.
[35:30.73]We did it.
[35:34.23]The game likes when you get close to the meat textures, I guess.
[35:40.13]OK, now we need 25.
[35:41.21]We have.
[35:42.21]Who took that?
[35:46.19]I don't know if it says it says on the right.
[35:51.43]Oh, you can go through the all of them.
[35:52.72]That's funny.
[35:54.48]There's yeah, there's you eating the pizza.
[36:00.10]That's cool.
[36:00.64]Nice OK, alright, we may have unlocked that didn't give us any money.
[36:06.85]Yeah, I got 100 bucks.
[36:11.55]There's a pro camera, but we can only buy one or we can buy two flashlights.
[36:16.28]Oh, there's a trap.
[36:18.44]That sounds good.
[36:21.04]Oh, if we put the trap down, we probably get a ton of pictures.
[36:23.84]Yeah, I feel like we need a trap.
[36:26.06]I'll order.
[36:27.00]How many traps?
[36:27.53]Two or four?
[36:29.43]We share money.
[36:31.76]Oh, yeah, we do.
[36:32.46]We do share money.
[36:33.42]You're right.
[36:35.82]Grab two.
[36:37.78]We need a flashlight.
[36:39.12]Grab two traps and a flashlight.
[36:40.48]Two and a flashlight.
[36:42.26]Yeah, that's good.
[36:45.02]Don't trust me with the flashlight.
[36:46.30]Someone else can have that.
[36:47.78]Yeah, I don't want that.
[36:49.22]I'll take the trap, though.
[36:50.30]I'll ruin everything.
[36:51.92]There's another trap here.
[36:52.81]I got the flashlight.
[36:55.81]I got a trap, too.
[36:57.15]Okay.
[36:58.05]Now I want to go to my favorite noodle spot in Chinatown.
[37:05.78]Do you guys like ramen?
[37:06.72]Like ramen you make at home?
[37:09.40]At home?
[37:10.29]That's bullshit.
[37:11.69]Yeah, not really.
[37:12.55]It's kind of like Outlast.
[37:17.99]It is kind of like Outlast.
[37:20.27]And, uh, yeah, so pretty much that's my story, honestly.
[37:23.05]Like, I've just, that's where, yeah, how I got here.
[37:25.51]That's cool.
[37:25.83]Yeah, we couldn't hear you in the loading screen.
[37:27.48]No, that was a good story.
[37:28.38]I heard the whole thing.
[37:30.20]Oh, hold on.
[37:31.58]Alright.
[37:32.75]Yeah, it's a great story.
[37:33.53]I like that and ramen is perfectly acceptable.
[37:35.95]Yeah, I love ramen.
[37:37.53]I love ramen like shit in black or like bulldack.
[37:42.39]Oh shit, let's go.
[37:43.07]Let's go.
[37:43.35]Let's go up.
[37:44.08]Be happy.
[37:44.68]Oh OK.
[37:46.64]Unless you guys want to split up.
[37:49.30]Let's stay together for the first few missions and then we can split up into teams if we want to.
[37:54.16]Yeah.
[38:01.43]Indomie
[38:05.54]Oh God.
[38:08.46]It's good.
[38:12.70]Yep, I have an idea.
[38:13.88]Gonna do a cool trick?
[38:17.85]No, I'm taking a nice photo.
[38:20.03]Alright, ready?
[38:21.87]I'll do it in the air.
[38:24.57]Ready?
[38:24.87]I'm gonna do an emote in the air.
[38:37.67]I don't... Can you make that jump reliably?
[38:42.66]How did I just miss that jump?
[38:43.76]How did I miss it so bad?
[38:44.68]I sprinted.
[38:44.94]I don't even understand what happened.
[38:46.22]I was holding shift.
[38:47.08]I was holding W and then I did... But then I had to try to press 2.
[39:01.72]I'm good wait there is fall damage then there is but not too much like from a little bit of heights you're good yeah I I was holding I was trying to get this get this ready what the oh I'm wasting I'm wasting a lot of film on that it's not really worth that much yeah just I don't know what happened alright alright
[39:29.81]I thought he was trying to take a picture of his feet while he was in the air.
[39:35.37]Okay, so that noise, that's a mine.
[39:37.70]The world repeats like that.
[39:39.72]That, you see, you hear that and you see that?
[39:43.36]That's a mine.
[39:44.56]Stay far away.
[39:46.26]How close can you be?
[39:46.88]There's a creature!
[39:47.60]There's a creature!
[39:48.20]It's just a little one.
[39:54.62]What the hell?!
[39:56.18]Oh, I'm okay.
[39:57.14]Sorry for screaming.
[40:01.93]Okay, I gotta save this joke.
[40:03.55]I have to save this joke.
[40:05.10]I'm not saying anything until they can all hear me.
[40:07.88]But I'll give you a preview.
[40:11.29]Remind me to tell this.
[40:12.63]What just happened to Poke was what happens in every single 90s movie where a small dog bites some guy in the ballsack.
[40:21.98]Like, jumps up and bites a guy in the balls.
[40:24.62]That doesn't happen anymore.
[40:25.72]Have you noticed that?
[40:27.18]Have you noticed that the hysterical guy gets his balls bit by a dog joke has not shown its face in probably 15 fucking years.
[40:37.85]10 years at least.
[40:39.67]Can you guys hear me right now?
[40:41.48]Yeah, I hear you.
[40:42.62]Oh, that's weird.
[40:43.12]I thought it was on push-to-talk.
[40:44.72]I'm just yapping.
[40:46.69]Yeah, because it's not funny.
[40:49.17]Okay, no, I didn't realize.
[40:50.77]Yeah, I don't think it's funny either, but I mean, I'm laughing at it now because I'm thinking about all the times I saw a, like, Jack Russell Terrier mix bite some guy's balls in a movie.
[41:06.00]Hideo Kojima photo mode.
[41:07.70]Unless... Yeah, or a chihuahua.
[41:09.88]Exactly, yeah.
[41:15.73]We got some goop.
[41:17.67]You wanna dance in front of it?
[41:18.79]I got a picture of it.
[41:20.97]I have one leg!
[41:22.61]He really does only have one leg.
[41:23.71]What's here behind us?
[41:24.91]The little monster was following us.
[41:27.86]Can someone dance in front of this?
[41:28.94]He has one leg?
[41:36.75]Nice, nice.
[41:37.77]Yeah, yeah.
[41:38.91]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[41:40.63]Multiplier.
[41:41.54]It's still doing a regular walking animation.
[41:43.88]It's just erased.
[41:44.98]That's funny.
[41:45.44]Man, it would suck if you die early.
[41:46.92]He's so dead here.
[41:49.08]This is no way Paul gets out of this.
[41:50.52]Should we go back for him?
[41:54.58]What's that noise?
[42:00.27]Where is it?
[42:01.29]What is that?
[42:02.19]What's upstairs?
[42:03.25]I'm hearing some kind of ghoul.
[42:10.61]There's like a guy in a speedo.
[42:11.87]I don't know why that guy's in a red speedo.
[42:15.87]That was him.
[42:18.40]Myself to be honest.
[42:19.78]I want a better view of that guy.
[42:20.74]That guy's from my Sims 2 playthrough.
[42:23.54]No!
[42:23.86]I'm still alive.
[42:27.32]You're fine.
[42:27.96]You're fine.
[42:29.98]We gotta get out of here.
[42:32.32]Sacrifice Yeek.
[42:43.27]By the way, The Sims 2 thing.
[42:47.78]That's such horse shit.
[42:49.18]I spend a whole day getting that to work.
[42:52.60]Downloading like 10 different patches and shit.
[42:54.78]And oh, by the way, a day later, we're going to announce it's releasing it tomorrow.
[43:00.18]I have one leg.
[43:06.17]I've heard it has problems though.
[43:14.52]So maybe I'll just keep on the one I'm already on.
[43:18.18]I heard you still kind of need to do some stuff to make it run fine.
[43:22.30]This is gonna kill him.
[43:40.19]Double fucking axle from the top rope.
[43:43.41]You're gonna make a full recovery.
[43:44.63]He says he's missing an arm.
[43:45.55]We gotta go.
[43:47.07]I'm gonna try to leave.
[43:50.31]It wasn't this door though.
[43:51.15]I don't remember how we got in here.
[43:53.87]It was over here.
[43:56.42]He almost got killed by the cigarette butt monster.
[43:58.82]He killed her.
[43:59.48]You take a picture?
[44:00.90]Should I take a picture?
[44:06.50]I didn't take one.
[44:07.90]I'm surprised.
[44:08.36]I don't even know how he's still alive.
[44:14.79]I'm going to save the trap.
[44:20.93]What was that noise?
[44:21.87]That's going to take his other leg.
[44:23.05]I hope it takes his other leg.
[44:26.75]Here it comes.
[44:28.37]Go on.
[44:30.50]Wait.
[44:38.20]I just threw a hand at the mine.
[44:39.70]Nothing happened.
[44:40.28]It's fine.
[44:40.54]I mean, if you just take my camera and take it home, won't it make more money if I explode to the trap?
[44:49.06]Are you climbing the ladder?
[44:49.92]Where are you going?
[44:50.72]He's got a point.
[44:51.64]He's got a point.
[44:52.28]Like, getting him... I'm sorry.
[44:53.72]What was that?
[44:54.08]Exploding?
[44:54.32]No, it's okay.
[44:55.22]It's whatever, man.
[44:58.59]I'm going this way.
[44:59.27]I don't think we're fit to climb.
[45:03.11]Screw the guy with one arm and one leg.
[45:06.27]What's that noise?
[45:08.77]Oh, it's Jerma.
[45:09.51]He's like dying endlessly.
[45:12.21]What?
[45:12.47]I don't even know.
[45:17.47]Wait.
[45:17.63]You can pick me up?
[45:19.21]That's interesting.
[45:20.03]Okay.
[45:20.93]Maybe we save money for bringing it home.
[45:23.25]I'm going to take his other leg.
[45:25.75]Oh, no, I can't.
[45:26.39]You can only take one body part.
[45:27.53]How is he carrying me?
[45:28.27]The body part replaces your camera.
[45:29.87]So you got to throw before you can take it.
[45:31.13]There's no way he can grasp.
[45:33.09]There's people near the helicopter.
[45:34.59]Be careful.
[45:35.57]I'm going to throw a leg at them.
[45:41.01]Yeah, he should have taken my leg and one of my arms.
[45:49.72]There's something in that.
[45:50.88]This thing is fucking shaking.
[45:54.34]Do you see that?
[45:59.99]Do we want to take a picture of it?
[46:01.31]Oh my God, that was horrible.
[46:12.64]know what give me one second give me one second oh oh no me trying to escape oh no okay we're good we're good oh no dude they should they should have taken left they should have aimed out the window oh yeah
[46:44.70]I really had to get off my chest, guys.
[46:46.36]That's just how I feel.
[46:48.86]Whoever picked me up, I really appreciate that.
[46:51.98]I get to be here with you now.
[46:53.40]I'm here.
[46:59.40]I got my leg back.
[47:02.70]Nice.
[47:03.86]Nice.
[47:07.58]Oh, nice.
[47:08.50]Yeah, yeah.
[47:09.14]Good one, good one.
[47:10.67]That is a really good one.
[47:13.79]Ooh.
[47:15.91]Is he stepping in the trap?
[47:18.25]Yeah.
[47:18.77]Whoa.
[47:20.01]Now that's a picture.
[47:21.49]That's just before I got like hit.
[47:23.90]Yeah.
[47:24.60]Those are some good ones.
[47:25.94]I wonder how many points you get for getting one of Spider-Man.
[47:32.22]So I have a quick comment.
[47:34.88]At one point when we were just there, a little rat thing ran up and kind of jumped up and bit you in what looked like in the balls, right?
[47:43.89]I would like to ask everybody here.
[47:46.48]When was the last time you remember?
[47:49.20]For me, it's been about 10 years.
[47:50.32]Remember how in every 90s comedy movie, a, like, Jack Russell Chihuahua mix would bite some guy's balls for, like, an extended two or three minutes?
[47:58.05]That's actually, yeah.
[47:59.73]Yeah.
[48:00.21]That has not happened in 10 years.
[48:01.19]Yeah.
[48:03.64]I've never been bitten in the balls by a dog.
[48:05.80]It's just terrifying.
[48:07.02]It was horrible, dude.
[48:08.56]When it actually gra- I put my hands in the air.
[48:11.14]Dude, stop.
[48:12.39]Yeah, I put my hands in the air, and I was like... And my eyes, like, I widened my eyes wicked bad, and then I turned left, turned right, turned left, turned right really fast, and the dog was, like, kind of swinging.
[48:25.05]You know what I mean?
[48:27.09]Oh, like, he was like an attachment.
[48:28.88]Who's the guy from Zoolander?
[48:31.04]What am I listening to right now?
[48:33.49]Meet the Fockers.
[48:34.51]I feel every movie he's getting bit by a dog.
[48:38.47]Ben Stiller.
[48:39.15]Yeah, he used every every like he would make a movie like two a year and each one he would get bit in the balls.
[48:44.97]Do you think Ben Stiller has been pretend bit in the balls by a dog more than any other comedian?
[48:52.97]Probably man.
[48:53.87]Wait wait wait wait wait.
[48:55.91]Are you guys even are you guys misremembering this?
[48:57.85]I don't remember this happening to Ben Stiller once.
[49:01.87]I mean, I remember he was dancing around with the gas.
[49:04.99]Wait, why are we leaving?
[49:05.49]We didn't get anything?
[49:06.71]Gas pumped.
[49:07.35]Yeah, we gotta get more points for the next checkpoint.
[49:09.85]Wait, there's one photo you guys gotta see.
[49:14.15]I swear I took a cool one.
[49:15.03]Hold on.
[49:16.37]Yeah.
[49:16.85]Sandler?
[49:17.46]That's pretty good.
[49:18.30]Alright, where's... Did you get Jerma falling?
[49:23.86]Oh, let's see.
[49:24.30]Oh, yeah.
[49:26.46]It's like a story.
[49:27.04]That's pretty sick.
[49:27.90]No, it's like a story.
[49:28.52]It's...
[49:31.84]That's a good one.
[49:32.46]That's you guys making it.
[49:33.78]Oh, then that's the cool stuff you were doing.
[49:36.29]Yeah, but I got a picture of you falling too, I swear.
[49:37.89]Dude, that's a pretty good jump.
[49:42.33]Yeah, that guy died.
[49:43.15]There's Zeke.
[49:48.07]Yeah, that's it right there.
[49:49.87]That's the one of you falling.
[49:50.65]Look, I got blood gore.
[49:53.37]Oh, what is this thing?
[49:57.06]Outworld.
[49:58.04]Weird.
[49:58.60]That's where babies come from.
[50:00.55]Alright, we only need 100 points.
[50:02.39]We should be good.
[50:03.07]Okay, if you get hungry, you can eat out.
[50:06.43]Are we out of traps?
[50:08.95]Wait, I never used the trap.
[50:11.69]It's gone.
[50:14.15]Oh, maybe you'd have to use it.
[50:15.79]You get to not get to keep stuff between.
[50:17.79]The one I used kind of bit your leg off.
[50:24.13]How's the audio, by the way?
[50:25.07]Can you guys hear everybody good?
[50:28.39]let's get moving boys I want to sprint it down through uh the first door we see alright I wouldn't recommend rooftops this time personally yeah let's cut let's cut through here oh I love it I think I see a green door that way this is fent lane my favorite part in New York city music changed
[51:02.36]Clean, clean job getting over that fence.
[51:07.20]Oh, this is the same entrance.
[51:08.59]That was a quick one.
[51:09.85]Let's do the other entrance because we might find additional content.
[51:13.01]We could also split up and do a two and two.
[51:15.29]Are we ready for it?
[51:15.93]You want to do a two and two?
[51:17.49]No, no, no.
[51:18.57]Next episode.
[51:19.49]Next episode, man.
[51:20.99]Yeah, learn more.
[51:26.61]Go.
[51:30.21]We only have one flashlight.
[51:32.55]Yeah, I got one.
[51:33.27]They have battery too, so I can't.
[51:35.55]Monster!
[51:36.51]Monster, all ready?
[51:37.63]All ready?
[51:41.31]I... That's the fucking Enderman thing I saw earlier.
[51:45.05]I definitely got him in that frame.
[51:46.31]No, wait, there's two left!
[51:47.39]Wait there!
[51:51.13]You just walked out of my frame!
[51:54.24]Oh, sorry.
[51:56.36]What the fuck?
[51:58.18]Maybe we should go in the other door.
[52:04.35]Vinny!
[52:05.63]It's bad, I know, it's just, it's just he, he's there.
[52:12.32]Okay, I have an idea.
[52:13.12]Uh, everybody get into the, the billiards room.
[52:19.70]Now, if this works.
[52:20.64]He's right there, in that door right there.
[52:23.18]Okay, okay, okay, do the thing, do the thing, do the thing.
[52:24.94]Everybody get on this side of the billiards table.
[52:27.10]And we're gonna walk around in a circle and we're gonna kite him around.
[52:31.10]Okay, that was a good picture.
[52:32.02]That was a good photo.
[52:34.33]I'm still alive, though.
[52:36.29]Yep, you're good.
[52:37.09]Wait, you have your arm.
[52:37.77]Yeah.
[52:44.04]You're leaving the trail.
[52:45.82]I'm following it.
[52:47.46]I'll just throw the hand at the monster.
[52:50.26]What a mistake that was.
[52:51.64]Get a picture, quick.
[52:52.96]Where'd they go?
[52:53.72]Where'd you guys go?
[52:56.64]Watch out!
[52:58.69]Where'd you guys go?
[53:03.16]I don't know where they went.
[53:04.13]There's too many things happening.
[53:07.93]I don't know where to go.
[53:35.93]Get me the fuck out of here!
[53:41.13]Don't go out that way!
[53:42.11]Don't go out this way!
[53:50.72]They're gonna see this.
[53:55.89]They didn't even notice I was on the ground.
[53:57.55]They don't even know it's me.
[53:58.51]Oh, whoa.
[53:58.67]Oh, whoa.
[54:22.88]That actually works.
[54:24.54]Yeah, I thought that would work too.
[54:25.61]Whose body is that?
[54:27.07]You know it doesn't.
[54:28.83]Oh.
[54:31.07]We get money for taking it home.
[54:34.53]So I would have been fine too.
[54:35.91]I just like the it's it's like OK when I hear all the echoes.
[54:44.00]I'm in the room and I hear all these echoes.
[54:45.72]People are talking blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah blah.
[54:47.96]I feel like a fucking daredevil when I can just like see everybody's voices.
[54:53.14]Oh yeah, I saw that earlier.
[54:54.48]Yeah, yeah.
[55:09.75]Play this in VR is actually this VR mode.
[55:13.63]That would be really fun, yeah.
[55:17.94]Dangerous game there Vinny.
[55:20.98]Oh nice.
[55:22.68]Oh, I got it.
[55:23.16]Bravery.
[55:23.64]I got a bravery bonus.
[55:38.55]He wants to get close.
[55:39.61]Yep.
[55:53.96]The YouTube thumbnail I don't think was worth taking it.
[56:10.62]That would have been an amazing YouTube thumbnail.
[56:16.43]Just like in World of Warcraft.
[56:22.03]What?
[56:22.45]What does that have to do with World of Warcraft?
[56:24.40]He died.
[56:24.88]He died in... He died in... Can you survive one mission?
[56:35.25]I don't know.
[56:37.45]Did you say the same shit last year, Ster, when I died?
[56:39.67]You made a joke about it?
[56:42.31]Did you die last year?
[56:43.43]I remember, yeah.
[56:45.41]I don't remember that.
[56:48.27]Ah, 60 in World of Warcraft Hardcore Classic.
[56:51.25]Sounds like a huge gamer move.
[56:52.51]I probably would have.
[56:53.21]Those are words.
[56:56.58]I would imagine the story just probably couldn't do it.
[56:58.92]Oh, nice one, Jerry.
[56:59.48]You're on the scoreboard.
[57:00.24]Yeah, I got it.
[57:01.18]That's a good one.
[57:01.76]Oh, Jerry.
[57:03.04]Oh, wow.
[57:04.24]Nice.
[57:04.94]That's not a good one.
[57:05.68]It's just me.
[57:06.87]It's just me.
[57:09.35]Ooh, that's a nice photo.
[57:10.97]That's a good one.
[57:11.43]That's a Steam store photo.
[57:18.40]I feel like we're getting worse.
[57:20.66]We just did the best we've ever done.
[57:23.26]Yeah, but the quality of these photos in the top, they actually weren't... I'm not impressed.
[57:28.32]I mean, look at that one.
[57:29.38]We'll fail upwards then.
[57:33.75]Yeah.
[57:35.17]Ranger boots give you more health, but they're very expensive.
[57:37.85]I bought another flashlight.
[57:44.19]So you're just going to spend all of our money?
[57:46.61]No.
[57:47.91]Uh, the flashy camera might be the best option.
[57:52.91]I'm not a scammer.
[57:53.49]I'll leave it up to you guys.
[57:55.17]I bought a flashlight, so I'm happy.
[57:56.65]They get more score.
[57:57.93]There's a score multiplier.
[57:59.37]Yeah, so it's like more score means more money, no?
[58:01.79]Or no?
[58:02.65]Four score and you know... Who wants to be the... More score, more score.
[58:07.20]Can I buy a zoom camera?
[58:09.16]Get the zoom camera.
[58:10.00]I feel like we could use it.
[58:12.58]The photo looks like it sucks.
[58:17.77]Does anybody want to use it?
[58:20.67]No.
[58:22.87]You deserve it.
[58:24.31]Yeah, you only bring one camera.
[58:26.09]Just take the big one.
[58:30.06]There you go.
[58:32.98]Walkie talkies if we split up.
[58:35.82]We have zero dollars.
[58:37.30]Yeah, we're broke now.
[58:46.03]We're finally going to be able to show the truth of what's happening.
[58:50.21]It sounds like an audio clip.
[58:51.25]Didn't even sound like him.
[58:56.82]I know it's crazy.
[59:03.98]So anyway, my noodle spot is probably somewhere down this way.
[59:06.36]Alright, I'm surviving this time.
[59:10.70]I promise noodles you like.
[59:13.86]I've been on a whole noodle kick lately.
[59:15.96]Udon noodles.
[59:18.64]Big, thick noodles.
[59:20.84]Yeah, I like udon noodles.
[59:22.07]I like ramen, but I like, like, you know, ramen that you get.
[59:24.83]Yeah.
[59:25.55]Angel hair gets, like, stuck between my teeth, you know?
[59:28.57]I like angel hair.
[59:29.27]Angel hair is good.
[59:30.51]You, like, you, like, sneeze once when it comes out your nose.
[59:33.39]That shit is a little too thin.
[59:35.33]Bow tie pasta is pretty, uh, pretty good.
[59:38.85]Love bow tie pasta.
[59:39.79]That's, yeah.
[59:41.80]Otay?
[59:42.20]Yeah.
[59:42.66]Is that a noodle?
[59:45.08]Technically, I think.
[59:46.90]I guess it's somewhere like pasta is a noodle or is noodle a pasta?
[59:50.04]I don't know.
[59:52.05]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[59:54.63]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[59:56.81]Hey, hey, hey, hey.
[59:57.47]Alright.
[60:00.31]Don't get lost in here.
[60:03.99]This place feels familiar.
[60:05.33]Yeah, it's almost like prefabricated building.
[60:11.88]They do that to save money when they build cities.
[60:13.70]Yeah, New York.
[60:16.26]You know?
[60:17.34]Yeah.
[60:18.18]Right?
[60:18.44]It's just like that time Paulie Walnuts and Tony Soprano were on the boat.
[60:23.75]So should I watch Sopranos?
[60:31.65]Yeah.
[60:32.19]I think everyone should.
[60:33.33]Okay.
[60:34.11]Do you hear that?
[60:39.24]Yeah, what is that?
[60:40.69]I'm hearing Scooby Doo.
[60:41.75]That's one riding with a marker.
[60:48.06]That is somebody riding with a marker.
[60:53.70]He's kind of in our way.
[60:55.26]He is in the way.
[60:57.84]Yeah, we can't like whack him.
[61:00.11]Yeah, can you hit him or anything?
[61:01.57]Can we fucking whack this guy or what?
[61:04.57]Hey, it worked.
[61:14.17]The fuck?
[61:15.39]It was loud.
[61:15.91]It was a very loud noise when I went in that corner.
[61:20.10]But I got a good photo.
[61:20.92]I got a good photo.
[61:21.96]Quick scoped him.
[61:23.26]There it is again.
[61:25.64]You gotta get in there.
[61:26.28]You gotta get in there.
[61:27.50]Is this map blacky for anyone else?
[61:30.10]Yeah.
[61:33.36]I'm seeing some teleporting.
[61:35.22]Alright, he's coming.
[61:36.62]Or maybe that's just part of the anomaly.
[61:38.06]Dude, that's wicked fucked up.
[61:43.36]I got nothing for it.
[61:46.11]This guy is griefing us.
[61:49.33]Yeah, he really is.
[61:50.15]Hey, can you guys come help get this guy out of the way?
[61:52.01]No.
[61:54.37]Wait, we're actually griefed.
[61:55.87]If we had to run away, he's blocking the door.
[61:59.50]Ster.
[62:02.74]I think we can go this way.
[62:08.84]Blood on the ground.
[62:13.87]Zero points.
[62:17.06]Blood is just not in right now.
[62:22.67]Wicked fucked up.
[62:27.27]That's that's weird.
[62:29.07]Do not forget, forget, forget your past snapping.
[62:33.57]Yeah, I don't know about this place.
[62:35.15]I don't think there's any monsters in here.
[62:37.65]Well, hold on there.
[62:38.85]There's one.
[62:56.57]I was in selfie mode for a millise- Oh, you're okay.
[62:59.03]Oh, you're good.
[62:59.51]It was- I think it was worth it to get the photo, but I don't have a leg anymore.
[63:10.41]Uh, can I have my leg back?
[63:12.20]Oh, thanks.
[63:12.62]Great.
[63:13.64]Can you- I wonder if you can, like, screw it back on.
[63:20.38]Show us a sign!
[63:23.66]Show them a sign.
[63:25.21]We're kind of running out of time.
[63:26.15]I don't want to give a sense of urgency.
[63:29.25]Whoa.
[63:29.53]What the fuck?
[63:32.71]What?
[63:35.33]Yeah, there's just, I think he's hiding this guy.
[63:37.72]So I'm going to go back outside and see what happens.
[63:39.52]So what happens if we take a picture of it?
[63:43.20]I don't know.
[63:43.94]Yeah, that's true.
[63:53.26]Dilla!
[63:59.80]We have an opportunity, I think.
[64:00.74]Holy shit!
[64:02.84]It actually is Godzilla!
[64:04.20]It actually is Godzilla!
[64:06.57]Oh my god!
[64:10.47]God damn it!
[64:32.02]I thought that was phone screaming.
[64:35.78]My headphones fell out of my ears.
[64:38.40]And I heard a Tom and Jerry scream.
[64:41.28]What do you want me to do?
[64:49.63]How am I supposed to live through that?
[64:51.23]It was a giant Cloverfield monster just broke through the sky.
[64:56.46]Oh my God, look at him.
[64:57.54]We don't want to be near that.
[64:59.71]Oh no.
[64:59.91]We gotta go now.
[65:00.57]Mr. Dead.
[65:00.97]This is terrible.
[65:01.91]What that whole?
[65:18.58]Don't stand around and take pictures.
[65:20.50]That's the game!
[65:21.60]Yeah, they're dead.
[65:22.86]It's called stand around and take pictures until a projectile hits you in the lens and shatters every bone in your eyes.
[65:31.97]Oh god, that's not good.
[65:36.27]He doesn't have a camera!
[65:45.38]Oh shit!
[65:49.82]Rolling around at the speed of sound.
[65:52.90]Why isn't it flying?
[65:54.56]Why isn't it flying?
[66:01.51]He's still alive?
[66:05.25]There's no way.
[66:07.39]Dude, my game is bugged.
[66:08.61]I can't even pick a different person.
[66:10.45]What does that mean?
[66:18.44]Is he gonna get in the heli?
[66:19.64]Yeah, where's Ster?
[66:26.32]You're alive?
[66:28.20]I'm doing it.
[66:29.09]What the fuck?
[66:29.81]This person is flying around the helicopter with bare feet, by the way.
[66:33.69]Well, get in here now, quick.
[66:37.51]Our helicopter pilot does have shoes.
[66:39.77]Alright, alright.
[66:41.61]Where'd you die?
[66:42.26]Okay, alright.
[66:43.36]I got killed by the first wave of cars that fell.
[66:48.51]Jerma's camera?
[66:51.27]You didn't want my camera.
[66:52.45]I'm sick.
[66:56.40]What about your camera, Jerma?
[66:57.50]Did anyone get yours?
[66:58.44]I don't think so.
[66:59.20]There was so much chaos.
[67:01.52]I found someone's arm.
[67:02.98]That was it.
[67:03.36]I have a cold.
[67:04.62]It really sucks.
[67:11.78]Oh.
[67:12.72]Wow.
[67:13.22]Good.
[67:14.12]I guess we got your camera.
[67:15.12]Oh, look at that photo.
[67:17.29]Well, Jerry is Poke.
[67:19.43]Oh, that's confusing.
[67:20.17]Cryptids are real.
[67:21.48]Oh, wait.
[67:21.90]I forgot you're here.
[67:24.04]You go by Jerry sometimes.
[67:25.34]Wow.
[67:27.46]Not often.
[67:28.28]Maybe like once a year.
[67:30.16]Yeah, I'll swap the name.
[67:31.26]I realized there could be one Jerry sometimes.
[67:33.90]No, no, there can be many Jerrys.
[67:40.36]Yeah, I wouldn't say the zoom camera was too helpful for Godzilla.
[67:44.89]No, it didn't look like it.
[67:46.25]Oh, look at that one.
[67:49.19]The definition on his legs, man.
[67:51.73]Wait, you guys can see this one right here?
[67:53.19]I see nothing.
[67:56.18]Yeah.
[67:56.66]Yeah, I see it.
[67:57.26]That actually is a blank.
[67:58.18]Good picture.
[67:59.60]It's too good for you.
[68:00.42]What the hell?
[68:06.00]That's the guy.
[68:06.76]We got a career in cryptozoology.
[68:12.33]So how do we make more money?
[68:14.95]Every time we get to the new threshold of points, it gives us 100 bucks.
[68:20.13]It's incremental.
[68:21.52]So we got like 150 last time.
[68:23.22]How many more?
[68:23.64]Oh, we have two days.
[68:29.34]Oh, this explains the things right here.
[68:32.24]Yeah, we need to get like 10 monsters to line up and I'll kiss us.
[68:39.12]I think we need to try.
[68:40.67]We need to kite.
[68:41.23]I think we need like a full human centipede.
[68:47.09]Darwin Award.
[68:48.03]How do we get that?
[68:49.05]For journalists who flirt with death for a laugh.
[68:54.49]Just each segment of the centipede would count as a different one.
[68:59.36]Gotta take a picture of someone like getting their leg chopped off as it's happening.
[69:02.66]Yeah, somebody has to get a picture of all three of the other players getting obliterated.
[69:08.70]Yeah.
[69:13.52]I feel like Ster could do that.
[69:15.56]Wait, do what?
[69:16.74]Sir, do you want to get obliterated or do you want to capture the obliteration?
[69:22.30]We'll never know.
[69:28.79]I've got the zoom camera, so I should be the sniper.
[69:31.29]Okay, okay.
[69:35.17]We should buy somebody those health boots and they'll be like the distraction.
[69:39.80]I want to try to paycheck.
[69:41.42]Let's let's go to the park because I want to put the strap down and I want to try to get the big like rock guy to stand still so we can just kind of take a bunch of pictures.
[69:50.00]OK, oh Geodude.
[69:51.72]Yeah, you think you can get them to evolve?
[69:56.11]What is Geodude evolving to again?
[69:59.89]Geoman.
[70:00.51]OK, gotcha.
[70:04.88]There's no park, Jerma.
[70:06.06]Oh, there's no park.
[70:06.88]Okay, well, I'll use it for something else.
[70:10.16]There's a panorama.
[70:11.80]I mean, there is a park in Chinatown, so this is bullshit.
[70:14.68]I'm just saying.
[70:17.66]I'm succeeding because I'm using my knowledge of New York City.
[70:21.78]Ooh, new spot.
[70:23.28]Can you guys give me one more minute?
[70:24.55]I gotta get to my dorm.
[70:25.65]My dorm.
[70:25.93]Let's go to my dorm.
[70:27.95]No.
[70:32.23]No rest for the wicked.
[70:33.99]Money don't grow on trees.
[70:35.59]I got bills to pay.
[70:36.71]Do you see a monster?
[70:38.59]Let me know.
[70:41.99]I hear something.
[70:43.47]There's a freak up here, Jerma.
[70:45.55]There's a freak.
[70:46.17]Freak?
[70:47.73]Okay.
[70:52.99]What up?
[70:54.77]Best picture of the whole night, by the way.
[71:07.27]Is he still in there?
[71:07.91]Yeah, he's in there.
[71:10.09]I don't know if he can open doors.
[71:11.91]About to find out.
[71:21.12]Well, then we're locked in.
[71:25.72]Oh, Jerma, come here.
[71:26.48]I did not get a burger box, so it's not food.
[71:29.14]Poke.
[71:30.02]Yo.
[71:31.14]Come check this out.
[71:37.72]I just got back!
[71:41.66]Am I dead?
[71:43.86]He took my leg off.
[71:45.51]He took my leg off.
[71:46.29]I got a good pic.
[71:47.09]Alright, I got good pictures this time.
[71:50.07]I need to survive.
[71:53.73]What the?
[71:54.69]What's going on here?
[72:00.13]That guy just exploded.
[72:00.93]Maybe he hit a landmine?
[72:04.93]Maybe.
[72:05.19]Oh, they both exploded.
[72:06.65]A monster and him.
[72:08.21]Oh, that would have been so awesome.
[72:09.31]Pile them up.
[72:10.37]Yeah, that had to have been like a landmine or something.
[72:14.54]Can we fake the news?
[72:15.90]Yeah, fake news, of course.
[72:17.62]What do you mean, can we fake the news?
[72:19.20]Can we?
[72:19.56]Oh, fake the news.
[72:20.42]Okay, I see what you mean.
[72:22.80]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[72:23.82]No, don't do it.
[72:24.44]Don't do it.
[72:24.80]No, they need to be having a pizza party.
[72:27.24]No, bring them over here next to the wall.
[72:29.65]This wall's all fucked up.
[72:31.35]Wait, we bring a monster here next to the wall?
[72:36.37]What was that?
[72:36.95]He just attacked you for no reason, by the way.
[72:43.04]I say we bring a monster here, attack, and we get a... That's a lie.
[72:47.92]One person take a photo and all of us gotta be like posed.
[72:51.33]You'll get big points.
[72:54.61]Okay, I got it lined up.
[72:58.23]Wait, what pose are... Um... I got two.
[73:03.54]Okay.
[73:05.10]Wait, what is... Is this a... Is this a... Am I doing the Elon?
[73:08.95]I mean, it's pretty... A 329?
[73:11.93]No, you're saying hello to a friend.
[73:13.83]Oh, no.
[73:16.07]Do a seven.
[73:16.73]Is that not the Elon, bottom left?
[73:19.11]Wow, that's what we're calling it now?
[73:20.39]I don't know.
[73:21.74]I think it's just a wave, dude.
[73:22.62]Oh, God.
[73:49.93]I can't even be in this room.
[73:54.09]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[73:55.73]Yeah, still is probably here too.
[73:57.07]I don't have any photos left, but it's alright.
[74:06.06]Awesome.
[74:09.12]Nice.
[74:18.74]OK.
[74:25.35]Line it up, line it up.
[74:26.45]Beautiful come on.
[74:29.03]One get to get a good shot of this.
[74:30.06]Come on.
[74:31.52]Perfect, perfect, perfect tail tail.
[74:33.34]Come on.
[74:34.72]Hit that.
[74:35.10]Come on, come on dog.
[74:35.88]Alright, what do you think about over here?
[74:43.37]I'm thinking about get the corner of this cab and then line that up and get the tail coming into frame.
[74:50.65]I don't know.
[74:50.97]I didn't.
[74:51.27]I didn't go to cameraman school.
[74:55.63]Before this whole thing.
[74:56.63]I was just a streamer.
[75:03.71]You worked with cameras.
[75:04.55]That's what it means.
[75:06.55]No.
[75:25.61]480.
[75:27.51]Watch out for that!
[75:28.23]Watch out for that!
[75:28.67]Watch out for that!
[75:29.37]That thing on the ground!
[75:31.45]I'm stuck!
[75:34.51]I'm out.
[75:34.96]I'm out.
[75:38.94]There's a Rockman out here.
[75:40.08]Geodude.
[75:40.44]Geodude.
[75:53.76]Don't look back.
[75:54.26]Just go!
[76:03.77]I made it for the first time ever.
[76:07.75]Is that actually the first time?
[76:09.01]That's the first time I've gotten back on the helicopter in an hour and 15 minutes.
[76:12.11]Oh, I guess you wouldn't have known that this is where all the deep conversations happen.
[76:16.67]Alright, well, let's go.
[76:19.65]Um?
[76:21.19]What do you think happens?
[76:24.97]Immediately, like immediately after you die, like what's the right when like the light like this light shut off?
[76:30.24]What do you think happens?
[76:32.65]uh credits start scrolling that'd be awesome actually it goes black and then it just starts top of the credits like lead role you're number one no no no no it goes down through everybody but how up would it be appearance what if you were like 10 rungs down on your like cast list what if you actually weren't the most important person in your story I don't know that would be interesting you'd look at it from a whole new perspective yeah do you get to watch the movie
[77:02.80]like rewind the tape um you get that you were like you were a side character in ratatouille like holy I know there was a rat cooking next door white yeah that was a pretty weird movie this is a middle school girl conversation in that person permanently forever
[77:31.74]I think with Vinny, he talks how much he knows New York.
[77:33.95]He can't find his way back.
[77:38.31]Is it safe to go outside or should we not even?
[77:40.79]That's a stupid idea.
[77:42.51]I mean, you can.
[77:44.31]You can get out it.
[77:45.15]Oh, they're coming.
[77:45.74]I see him.
[77:46.12]I'm zoomed in on him.
[77:48.12]Hello?
[77:49.00]Hey.
[77:51.04]Oh, come on.
[77:51.74]You can do it.
[77:53.26]We're so close.
[77:54.72]Vinny died.
[77:55.22]I got his camera.
[77:56.28]Oh, nice.
[77:59.12]That's the best outcome.
[78:00.52]Boy, am I glad to see you.
[78:11.74]It's always funny.
[78:12.78]It's funny every time.
[78:13.86]It continues to be funny.
[78:15.14]Also, Ster, I heard you talking shit about me.
[78:19.93]Just saying.
[78:21.73]But you're not going to talk shit when you see the best photo of the night.
[78:25.70]uh well I don't know that I got a good one I think we all got the same photos Jerry that's a good one Jerry Jerry keeps getting on the board oh there we go that's good what the hell is that I love that guy I never saw him oh look at that one it's a movie
[78:49.22]Holy shit, 724?
[78:51.44]I don't even know how that happened.
[78:53.04]I think there were several monsters in the scene.
[78:56.08]A survivor was in front, I think.
[78:57.64]That's why.
[78:58.34]So I just realized that Jerry is in Jerma.
[79:02.18]Yeah.
[79:03.07]Oh, my God, it's my fault.
[79:04.15]I'm so sorry.
[79:04.83]Hang on, I want to see something.
[79:07.03]So it's my bad.
[79:08.15]Dog alien, journalist, fleeing survivor, and bravery.
[79:11.75]Oh, that's why.
[79:12.29]Okay.
[79:15.17]Wait, so what's...
[79:19.61]What was wrong with this one?
[79:21.19]Man, put that one right in the bestiary.
[79:23.07]Look at me and this guy were just chilling.
[79:25.59]Just having a conversation.
[79:26.55]I interviewed him.
[79:27.37]And apparently that's... We all want to see his violence.
[79:30.09]Apparently we want to see blood and guts.
[79:31.65]Right, guys?
[79:32.77]I talked to him.
[79:34.39]Whatever.
[79:37.20]It's not very sensational.
[79:38.92]I mean, I got him gesticulating.
[79:40.60]So I'm just as disappointed.
[79:46.76]We got money now.
[79:47.32]We got 300 bucks.
[79:49.82]300 bucks!
[79:51.20]Yeah, whoever wants to be the bait should get the shoes.
[79:53.41]Are we splitting up?
[79:55.99]We should make a stop motion video.
[79:58.89]We should make a claymation.
[80:03.68]I wonder if we can do something like, what do we have, 40 photos total?
[80:07.94]Just make a gigantic flipbook.
[80:10.12]I like that idea actually.
[80:15.23]Do you guys want to make a flip book?
[80:16.29]OK, we got two.
[80:17.67]That's good enough.
[80:18.35]Hey, this is me on the walkie talkie over.
[80:22.63]Can y'all hear me over?
[80:24.31]Roger over.
[80:44.19]Uh, can anybody else hear it if you're in the vicinity or just the person that has it?
[80:49.30]Wait, can... Yo, yo, uh, yo, Jerma.
[80:52.88]Yo.
[80:53.30]Yo, Jerma.
[80:54.48]Yo.
[80:55.64]What up?
[80:56.16]Well, I don't know if you're just too close to... You're right here, though.
[81:01.84]Oh, you're right.
[81:02.40]Can you hear me from the... Can they hear me on your thing?
[81:05.54]Yo.
[81:05.96]Can you hear me?
[81:06.38]No, I can't.
[81:07.17]Yo.
[81:08.49]Yo.
[81:09.15]Yo.
[81:09.45]I'll have to relay messages then.
[81:12.45]Yo.
[81:12.55]Yo.
[81:15.96]Yo.
[81:17.28]We need... Hey, we need six... We... Okay.
[81:19.49]We gotta be ready for a Godzilla photo session here.
[81:23.47]We need 6,000 points.
[81:24.59]That's a lot.
[81:25.33]I lowkey think that sports shoes go crazy.
[81:29.61]Yeah, those are great, but I mean... We need money.
[81:31.87]We can't get them now.
[81:32.97]Yeah.
[81:35.11]My theory is the more we keep going, the crazier shit happens, because now we see Godzilla every night.
[81:40.87]Yeah, let's keep... smelling.
[81:47.34]Are we doing another good camera or flashlights?
[81:49.98]I mean, do we have any flashlights amongst ourselves?
[81:51.88]I don't think we have any.
[81:52.92]I got one.
[81:53.40]You got one?
[81:55.06]Here, you know what, Jerm?
[81:55.82]Why don't you take one?
[81:57.24]Yeah, let me take one.
[81:59.80]Thank you.
[82:01.41]One person who doesn't have a walkie get the flashlight, then we do a flashlight walkie combo duo.
[82:08.21]Efficiency.
[82:08.59]I got a camera walkie.
[82:10.51]I got flashlights.
[82:11.61]Alright, who are we splitting up into groups here?
[82:18.56]I have a flashlight.
[82:20.18]It's not me and Poke.
[82:21.03]I have a flashlight.
[82:23.25]Groups?
[82:23.89]Alright, Poke, let's go.
[82:28.65]Man, last time I was in a group, like, what really happened was, uh... Fuck up the joke?
[82:41.62]Did I fuck up the joke?
[82:42.94]Yeah, pretty bad.
[82:43.98]It was just too soon, buddy.
[82:47.15]Just too soon.
[82:51.29]Wait, was this a three star?
[82:52.42]Did you smile?
[82:53.04]Did anyone smile?
[82:54.34]I smiled.
[82:55.84]I smiled for different reasons over.
[82:57.72]I mean, over.
[83:01.72]I felt warm and tickly in my tummy.
[83:05.55]Ster, what do you, um, what do you think the devs of this game were saying when they made, like, this?
[83:13.87]Shut the fuck up.
[83:15.93]If there was, like, a, what do you think was kind of going through the twisted mind of the developer?
[83:22.04]Is this a callback joke?
[83:23.70]You don't want to go with me?
[83:24.60]Alright, well, we'll... Can you explain to me the context of that joke while we're in there?
[83:31.70]he's he's gonna complain about me don't you hate that like people could just like he's over there complaining okay the joke is this so um I mean I was yeah yeah okay so before we get into any any funny jokey stuff here let's make sure we we talk we explain where we are like tell them where we are yo he's telling me on the walkie talkie that it is
[83:56.69]Yo, he's telling me it's wicked fucked over there.
[83:58.33]Yeah.
[83:59.47]Ask him if he thinks, like, where they are, if it's, like, if it's a particular way or not.
[84:04.99]Just ask him that.
[84:05.89]Do you think where you are is a way or not, said by Jerma?
[84:10.53]A particular way.
[84:11.91]A particular way.
[84:13.56]Jerma is asking if it is a particular way.
[84:20.48]He says, particular way.
[84:21.98]I don't have any information on that statement, sir.
[84:23.82]That's what he said.

[84:34.15]Okay, let me see.
[84:34.61]Let me see.
[84:37.85]How do I use it?
[84:39.67]Right click.
[84:40.47]Hey, just checking in to see if there's a particular way that you feel about where you are right now.
[84:46.01]That little guy!
[84:49.43]Hold on, register away.
[84:50.62]One way or another.
[84:55.71]Alright, what was that?
[84:57.91]It was a little guy.
[84:58.81]But I think the big guy is right there.
[85:01.77]Get out of the way, you fucking idiot!
[85:10.38]Oh, that guy.
[85:11.28]No, no, not you, not you.
[85:25.58]Alright, we need to get this guy into the... Okay, we have to somehow move this guy right here so he gets killed by the monster and we can get a picture.
[85:36.97]Wait.
[85:37.11]How do we move him?
[85:38.35]It's coming to you!
[85:42.49]It's coming to you!
[85:52.63]Why is he running from us?
[85:54.83]That guy's running from us.
[85:57.97]Right when I got the perfect shot, you're fucking bald head.
[86:02.70]Why is he running from the two of us?
[86:04.94]We got to get out of here.
[86:06.18]There's a picture of us ahead.
[86:08.06]It could have been the best photo.
[86:15.50]Oh, he's a walkie.
[86:19.51]Are they alive?
[86:20.19]Hold on.
[86:20.59]Careful.
[86:22.31]This is a weird guy here.
[86:23.45]That is some New York shit.
[86:25.67]Yeah.
[86:27.44]He's got something in his hand.
[86:29.62]He's after me.
[86:30.14]He's after me.
[86:30.56]He's on me.
[86:32.42]He's doing a Naruto run.
[86:34.12]Where'd he go?
[86:35.86]He's gone.
[86:36.44]He just left.
[86:37.46]Okay.
[86:42.39]Can I get a check on where you guys are at the moment?
[86:45.29]We're trying to get out of here.
[86:52.46]I don't know if you can... They might be dead.
[86:55.94]They said their way was fucked, so we need to go there.
[87:02.12]Apparently, Ster is stuck, so they're having some trouble.
[87:05.83]We should... Oh, no!
[87:09.83]No!
[87:10.33]No!
[87:11.07]No!
[87:14.65]Oh, I fell in there.
[87:21.95]What was that?
[87:22.59]I don't know.
[87:28.05]Wait, I gotta get this picture.
[87:29.67]Grab the camera.
[87:30.39]Grab the camera if I die.
[87:35.06]It's always worth it.
[87:35.82]What the hell?
[87:36.32]What?
[87:49.84]What is that?
[87:50.88]I'm alive!
[87:51.36]I'm alive!
[87:51.68]I don't know where to go!
[87:54.50]I don't know where to go!
[87:55.54]There's so many bugs!

[89:03.79]Oh my God, you're alive!
[89:05.63]Oh my God, you're alive!
[89:07.66]Thank God!

[89:13.80]Let me get right in the... Let me get right in the... How do we leave?
[89:22.15]We got three minutes.
[89:23.03]I don't know how to get... I don't know where the helicopter is.
[89:28.83]Dude, get a picture of that.
[89:30.61]That's fucking a million action points.
[89:40.87]I will sacrifice myself.
[89:42.21]Just get a picture.
[89:49.25]Where's this camera?
[89:49.93]I need it.
[90:00.98]Which one of these is his?
[90:03.00]Which one of these is his camera?
[90:06.48]There's a million of these on the ground.
[90:15.72]I'm stuck!
[90:21.48]Oh, shit!

[92:42.10]It is what it is.

[93:18.79]I remember that.
[93:19.47]Oh, wow.
[93:20.23]I used to watch a lot of... I used to love that TV.
[93:22.89]That was, uh, Will Sasso as Tony, and it would, like, cut every time he cursed.
[93:26.16]Yeah.
[93:26.52]It was just like that.
[93:27.52]It was like, they just cut the swearing only.
[93:30.22]Uh-huh.
[93:35.52]Good-ass blip.
[93:39.75]There's a mine in here.
[93:40.73]Don't make my mistake.

[94:08.56]Whoa, that's- We gotta get somebody to walk into that.
[94:29.23]Please get out of the way.
[94:31.05]Why is this guy just blocking the door?
[94:38.18]This is a maze.
[94:40.66]He's still alive.
[94:42.64]He's gone now.
[94:45.24]What if I throw a body at the tentacle thing?
[94:48.74]Ready?
[94:49.20]What tentacle?
[94:50.56]Oh yeah, like in Half-Life.
[94:51.70]Let's see.
[94:53.26]I missed.
[94:54.36]Here, I'll try it.
[94:59.65]Uh, that was weird.
[95:00.33]It's gone.
[95:01.07]Uh, I got a picture of it.
[95:01.95]Whoa.
[95:02.55]Be careful.
[95:05.91]What does this thing do?
[95:06.87]This thing's blinking.
[95:30.85]Oh, is it a mine in the ground in there?
[95:35.94]Yeah, that happened to me too, Puck.
[95:40.08]What?
[95:41.30]Wait, that wasn't you?
[95:42.94]No.
[95:43.80]The monster killed the NPC, which... Look, I'm going to throw this bomb at the mine.
[95:50.01]Yeah, do that.
[95:50.53]I'm going to throw this person.
[95:52.07]Yeah.
[95:53.97]What happened?
[95:58.29]You good, Puck?
[96:00.92]Uh-oh.
[96:02.18]Poke?
[96:05.61]I don't know if Poke made it.
[96:06.43]This is nice.
[96:26.39]Alright, you're good.
[96:26.97]You're okay.
[96:34.19]I got to get out of here.
[96:35.17]I don't got a leg.
[96:37.35]Do I?
[96:40.68]Where did we come in?
[96:41.46]I think they're going to be alright.
[96:55.74]He died?
[96:56.22]You got his camera?
[96:58.56]Yeah, I got it.
[97:01.20]Alright, let's GTFO.
[97:02.60]What a beautiful day today.
[97:16.92]This is scary.
[97:17.45]Alright, we're gonna use this guy.
[97:20.41]Oh, the helicopter's right where it's standing.
[97:25.67]I'm gonna get an amazing photo of this guy dying.
[97:27.36]Yeah, get a good one, get a good one.
[97:56.34]of guns.
[97:57.92]Oh, shit.
[97:58.44]Are they going to shoot me?
[98:06.31]Dude, that's a good one.
[98:09.01]Shit.
[98:10.73]They're just all going to die immediately.
[98:14.37]Oh, so are you.
[98:16.47]I just died.
[98:17.25]Oh, man.
[98:19.62]Ster's the only one alive.
[98:20.56]Dude, alright.
[98:21.34]When the gigantic monster shows up, are you
[98:27.15]It's standing on the helicopter.
[98:28.97]It stands on the helicopter, yeah.
[98:31.37]I just died.
[98:32.50]Yeah, we're going to have a lot of trouble actually surviving.
[98:39.46]Oh, my God.
[98:41.86]I don't think we have good enough photos.
[98:45.56]Oh.
[98:46.85]I had it.
[98:48.73]No!
[98:49.45]No!
[98:59.52]oh that was perfect we have one round to get all of the points we can do this we got this oh this game is so stupid it's fun though wait why is there one camera zero dollars oh yeah I think yeah you gotta rebuy the cameras yeah oh dude well everybody we need to be on our best behavior there's no way we're getting 6k
[99:26.82]Does it start you from like level one again or are we unlocking them?
[99:31.04]I would imagine we're probably going to start over.
[99:34.54]Yeah, if it's like lethal.
[99:35.64]Alright, should we start over then?
[99:39.30]Because there's no way we're getting 6k.
[99:41.48]We can do it.
[99:42.14]All we need is 1500 each.
[99:43.64]We all have to live.
[99:44.36]Honestly, save all your photos for the final monster.
[99:48.25]It's like 300 to 500 every time you take a picture of that thing.
[99:51.29]We could just farm it.
[99:54.23]Hopefully I got that out before the cutoff.
[99:58.31]like Farmville.
[99:59.75]Yes.
[100:01.27]What if we sacrifice each other at the end and just take the cameras and one person lives to tell the tale?
[100:06.79]That's very true too.
[100:08.52]We may not actually plan on doing that.
[100:11.68]It's probably just going to happen anyway.
[100:13.58]Yeah.
[100:14.60]We got this.
[100:15.44]What if we like wear each other's skin after we die?
[100:19.86]Wouldn't that be fun?
[100:21.78]I mean, I'd like to keep my skin on if that's okay with you guys.
[100:31.82]I have confidence we're going to get some major points.
[100:36.68]Oh, that's the squid.
[100:54.43]Not wasting a picture on that bullshit.
[100:56.80]It's nothing.
[100:58.02]It was 50, 50 only.
[100:59.82]Yeah, don't even take a picture of it.
[101:01.04]Have you seen this squid?
[101:03.34]Oh, and there's a little... There's three already.
[101:08.00]I don't think they followed us in here.
[101:10.52]They did not.
[101:13.37]What if I, like, get a... We gotta, like, find one of the NPCs and lure it to them, you know, and they'll start eating them.
[101:26.82]I mean I could... There's two coming down the hallway.
[101:34.07]There's something else up here too.
[101:35.11]Yep.
[101:45.48]There's a weird looking thing.
[101:47.68]Yeah, it grabs you with the tentacle.
[101:49.38]That's what got me stuck in a wall.
[101:51.29]Should we just get out of here then?
[101:53.43]No, you should let it eat you and I'll get pictures of Spider-Man.
[101:57.37]Okay.
[101:58.19]No!
[101:58.47]He won't die.
[101:58.93]Oh, okay.
[101:59.63]Alright.
[102:00.01]Ready?
[102:04.45]Come here, you alien!
[102:19.21]Uh, help?
[102:19.93]Oh, that was a 680.
[102:24.09]I got a 680 on him.
[102:25.81]Nice, nice.
[102:26.25]Alright, watch out, watch out.
[102:26.89]This thing's right here.
[102:38.72]He's pissed.
[102:39.16]Squid's back up.
[102:52.33]It ran away.
[102:52.81]It doesn't like us.
[102:54.35]Watch out.
[102:54.71]Watch out.
[102:54.95]Watch out.
[102:55.35]Watch out.
[102:55.61]Dude, watch out.
[103:01.02]I don't like that one.
[103:01.76]That one's a little weirdo.
[103:07.49]Oh, just him posing was 400.
[103:08.93]Yeah, I just got like 300 or 400 too.
[103:13.27]We have to try to find a way to get...
[103:15.12]Oh, there's like a little spider on the ground too.
[103:18.23]This place is full of them.
[103:19.89]Alright, here's the plan, Ster.
[103:21.49]Are you ready?
[103:23.61]I am going to aggro all of them.
[103:24.93]I'm going to aggro all of them.
[103:26.27]Get a good picture.
[103:37.64]Okay.
[103:38.30]Are you good?
[103:41.72]Are you good?
[103:42.96]Dude, what?
[103:43.56]What?
[103:43.90]Oh, he's alive.
[103:56.28]Okay, thank God.
[104:01.84]What do you think it was?
[104:02.81]What was it?
[104:03.21]Is it the ectoplasm?
[104:05.16]Oh, I thought it killed him instantly.
[104:06.76]I don't know.
[104:07.04]I was about to say that's so stupid.
[104:08.34]I don't know what it was.
[104:09.48]To this day.
[104:10.00]That was Joel's alt.
[104:16.21]Oh, mine.
[104:18.19]How do we send him in here?
[104:19.13]His reaction was so funny too.
[104:20.73]I don't know.
[104:23.41]I'm responsible for his photos as well.
[104:25.67]I think he thought I did that somehow.
[104:27.40]Like I was able to attack him.
[104:46.98]I'm just watching a comedy movie right now.
[104:49.02]I've been in the movie theater just laughing at the screen for an hour and a half.
[104:53.50]What is he looking at here?
[105:05.05]We got military.
[105:07.52]Military action.
[105:13.57]Oh, it is not going well over here.
[105:16.73]Oh, it's Godzilla this time.
[105:19.81]They can get some good photos of this, I think.
[105:29.38]Terrible dog shit.
[105:31.18]There's so much opportunity here for some good action.
[105:36.76]Oh, that's got to be a good one.
[105:40.08]Oh, what?
[105:49.74]Oh, Jerry, it's storm chasers, you know what I'm saying?
[105:53.84]They only got four minutes.
[106:12.63]Dude, you got T-rexed.
[106:16.03]What happened?
[106:19.31]Oh, no.
[106:19.73]Oh, no.
[106:23.86]Dude, I wasn't even near it.
[106:25.36]He eats you.
[106:26.08]I wasn't near you.
[106:30.22]You are done.
[106:31.72]I'm mad, too, man.
[106:34.64]I wasn't near it.
[106:36.76]I teleported into his mouth.
[106:38.64]Review the footage.
[106:39.76]I sacrificed myself so Ster got a 1000 point photo.
[106:43.95]Did you see what happened to me?
[106:45.77]No, I was scrolling around.
[106:47.53]I was on the roof.
[106:48.65]I had like pictures worth 1500 and then I jumped down onto like a catwalk coming off the roof and it had no collision.
[106:55.83]I fell through and I hit the floor and I died right next to the helicopter.
[107:00.77]Honestly, I could have maybe even had 6,000 myself, you know?
[107:05.08]Pretty good pictures.
[107:09.22]I'm just going to start screaming.
[107:12.64]Vinny, is there such thing as a chicken cutlet that's too thin?
[107:18.79]I like paper thin.
[107:20.13]I do too.
[107:20.41]How are we feeling about this game?
[107:24.45]Feeling good.
[107:26.85]You're not feeling good?
[107:28.23]No, I like it.
[107:29.72]I like it.
[107:30.18]I could do another, um, you want to speed run through?
[107:32.96]Cause we can, I just, you know, take photos of.
[107:35.18]Yeah, I think we're good.
[107:39.59]Let's speed run it.
[107:40.63]Beginning.
[107:41.43]Let's see.
[107:41.87]We can do the beginning.
[107:43.79]We all get those expensive ass shoes.
[107:47.95]Oh, how do you put those on?
[107:49.37]By the way, I was walking around with them.
[107:52.33]I think they just have to be in your inventory.
[107:53.79]Oh, really?
[107:54.95]Oh, really?
[107:56.00]Oh, really?
[107:57.32]Oh, really?
[107:57.68]Alright, everybody, hold a note at the same time.
[108:00.08]Look, I really hate these guys.
[108:13.41]I'm playing with these guys.
[108:14.92]Yo, what's up, guys?
[108:16.36]Hey, we're right here.
[108:18.90]Wait, I wasn't muted.
[108:27.36]Hope is so disrespectful.
[108:29.00]Yes, we're starting from the beginning.
[108:31.92]Faster running than usual.
[108:33.84]Who wants to do the sewer?
[108:38.52]Uh, this lady.
[108:41.12]I'll do it.
[108:41.62]Just take pictures of it.
[108:44.91]Okay, alright.
[108:45.85]Are you ready, guys?
[108:47.71]No, no, no.
[108:48.49]Okay.
[108:49.25]I think selfie form is... Ah, that's one photo that we don't have now.
[108:56.06]Failure.
[108:59.68]We got the we can go inside up here.
[109:08.27]Already a big huge monster.
[109:11.85]No, that's loud things.
[109:18.97]Everybody split up.
[109:19.79]Alright, I'm gonna jump on the mind.
[109:23.27]Just take pictures.
[109:26.04]Where's the mine?
[109:26.38]Right here.
[109:27.14]Hold on.
[109:27.60]Let me get a good shot of this.
[109:28.34]There's a spider!
[109:31.90]I gotta get a cool angle and everything.
[109:34.80]Alright, I am ready.
[109:35.64]You ready?
[109:35.86]Yep.
[109:36.00]Alright, here we go.
[109:41.61]Why is it not exploding?
[109:42.83]You've gotta step off of it.
[109:45.03]What?
[109:48.17]Wait jump. Jump! Jump!
[109:54.03]That was big.
[109:54.45]473.
[109:55.03]How about you guys?
[109:57.31]Like 300.
[109:57.79]Yeah, because I got someone else jumping in front of it, I think, too.
[110:04.91]Well, I should not take this.
[110:06.15]Jerma, stand still.
[110:07.12]Jerma, stand still.
[110:12.06]Dude, I have it on my face.
[110:13.10]Did I just take a picture of it on my head?
[110:15.14]500.
[110:15.24]I got 500 on that.
[110:19.05]Give me Vinny's camera.
[110:20.35]I got no pictures left.
[110:21.61]Okay.
[110:21.85]Nope.
[110:22.75]Nope.
[110:23.77]Nope.
[110:23.93]Should we just, like, spam our pictures and then leave?
[110:31.01]Uh, am I glitched?
[110:38.92]Hello?
[110:40.08]I can't... I don't know what... Hello?
[110:44.42]Are you good?
[110:46.24]No, I'm...
[110:48.21]You seem to be okay.
[110:52.88]I don't know what's happening.
[110:56.04]Did you die?
[110:58.60]You got... Uh-oh.
[111:00.36]What?
[111:00.84]He's gone.
[111:02.62]I have no idea what... He said he was glitching out.
[111:04.46]He said... He's like, can you guys hear me?
[111:06.44]And then he left.
[111:07.38]And I think he had the cameras too.
[111:09.66]I think he had Vinny's and his camera.
[111:11.26]He's still in the party.
[111:13.82]Yes, sir.
[111:14.30]Can you hear us?
[111:17.28]I think he's disconnected.
[111:18.34]Okay, well.
[111:22.27]That's unfortunate.
[111:22.97]He had a bunch of good pictures.
[111:26.67]What the frick?
[111:27.73]Yeah.
[111:29.93]Well, is Vinny dead too?
[111:31.11]Oh, yeah.
[111:31.61]Vinny died from the mine.
[111:34.73]How many photos do you have?
[111:35.48]How many photos left?
[111:40.46]Why are the cameras out here?
[111:42.36]Yeah, what is this?
[111:42.90]Can I have one?
[111:44.82]No.
[111:46.02]Stay here.
[111:49.15]Nice.
[111:49.37]Should we go back in?
[111:54.69]Or should we head back?
[111:55.36]Wait, there's a flashlight on the floor.
[111:58.06]See that?
[111:59.12]Yeah.
[111:59.92]What the hell?
[112:00.38]Maybe it's dead?
[112:06.00]I don't know.
[112:07.56]No, it's because the door is in front of it.
[112:08.88]Trying to open the door.
[112:11.06]Yeah, I was trying to pick stuff up before I... Apparently, I just rejoined their game.
[112:14.34]Oh, hi.
[112:14.80]There you are.
[112:15.86]I hear you.
[112:18.39]Are you around us?
[112:19.63]Yeah, we're Ster talk.
[112:23.05]Oh, maybe we just heard him in the beginning.
[112:24.90]OK.
[112:26.56]Load into spectator, whatever.
[112:27.74]I got this.
[112:47.33]That was actually worth, like, 300.
[112:48.27]Oh god.
[112:48.45]That was 300!
[112:48.74]How about now?
[112:49.20]Dude, that was 700!
[113:21.65]Guys, which way is the helicopter?
[113:24.33]If I go, is it up here and left?
[113:52.86]Oh hey, what's up?
[113:57.15]Are you?
[113:58.57]Hello?
[114:01.65]Why is it being so weird?
[114:02.59]Why is this?
[114:03.24]Is he a real person?
[114:13.31]What is he doing?
[114:36.75]Why is he not talking?
[114:37.63]He's being weird.
[114:47.64]I used a bunch of the pictures.
[114:53.67]His setup is messed up, OK.
[114:56.59]So.
[114:58.17]Hello.
[114:59.29]Now I can hear you.
[115:00.01]We can hear you now.
[115:00.71]What the fuck was that, sir?
[115:01.89]Can you explain?
[115:03.35]I just completely desynced and I got kicked, but I was able to rejoin.
[115:07.43]So I don't know.
[115:09.49]Did you guys were able to get my cameras?
[115:11.64]I did.
[115:12.26]I had really good pictures.
[115:13.72]I took your camera.
[115:15.38]Oh, no, I didn't.
[115:15.98]You disconnected everything.
[115:19.24]I think I just had a photo of.
[115:22.81]Oh, there we go.
[115:23.55]That's a damn good one.
[115:25.55]Damn.
[115:26.90]He's farting.
[115:29.34]That's a crazy photo.
[115:32.32]That photo sucks.
[115:33.14]Hello?
[115:34.55]Hello?
[115:35.01]Yo, we just farmed.
[115:36.77]I'm sick.
[115:38.41]I'm sick.
[115:40.92]Oh, a thousand in one go.
[115:43.00]I hate having a cold.
[115:44.14]You got a cold?
[115:44.94]Everyone's sick right now, man.
[115:46.42]Yeah, flu or something.
[115:48.22]You want me to make you soup?
[115:49.34]I thought I muted the cough.
[115:50.38]If you guys heard that, I'm very sorry.
[115:51.46]I can come over and make you soup.
[115:54.67]I hope you feel better, Poke.
[115:55.75]Yeah, Poke.
[115:56.01]You weren't at MAGFest, were you?
[115:57.69]Huh?
[115:58.87]No.
[115:59.45]No.
[116:00.17]Yeah, Poke, I have a similar cough, too.
[116:03.69]You have a similar cough, too?
[116:04.83]It's light.
[116:05.67]It goes...
[116:11.70]That was amazing.
[116:17.98]Oh my god.
[116:21.48]Alright, let's go.
[116:23.32]Go next.
[116:23.62]Was that intentional, Jerma?
[116:24.56]Did you do that on purpose?
[116:25.56]No, there is no way he did that on purpose.
[116:27.72]That was the best timing ever.
[116:28.82]He just did a normal little cough.
[116:30.56]He just did a normal little cough.
[116:31.63]He had no idea.
[116:33.17]Jerma, you need to hear that back from my end.
[116:36.81]That cough glitched out.
[116:38.27]It was amazing.
[116:45.26]I think he knows.
[116:46.54]How does he do that?
[116:47.20]How does he know how to do that?
[116:51.14]I have a cough that sounds like this.
[116:53.74]What's your guys' weirdest laugh?
[116:57.77]Alright, let's go around the helicopter.
[117:04.01]What's your most self-conscious laugh?
[117:06.33]Yeah, alright.
[117:06.93]Which one are you nervous about using?
[117:09.68]Nobody get back in the helicopter now!
[117:12.95]I mean, okay.
[117:14.53]Get in the helicopter.
[117:15.25]We're on a timer.
[117:16.11]I don't care how long the timer is.
[117:17.51]It might leave.
[117:18.05]Wait, what?
[117:20.72]Oh, shit.
[117:21.62]It actually might leave.
[117:22.22]It might definitely leave.
[117:23.00]Alright, it leaves.
[117:28.92]I'm scared.
[117:31.08]Which lap do I calculate?
[117:32.30]No, it's not like that.
[117:33.14]It's just like... I do RNG selection out of eight.
[117:39.43]Do you have a lap you don't like?
[117:42.23]Yeah, two.
[117:43.59]I actually really do.
[117:44.65]It's weighted really low.
[117:48.06]Which laugh do you do that you hate that you do?
[117:52.80]Ster, do you want to do it?
[117:53.56]We should all do them, but we don't judge here.
[117:56.49]That one.
[118:00.85]When you snort.
[118:03.13]Actually, I don't like when I go.
[118:04.45]I don't like when I go.
[118:09.14]I hate that.
[118:09.82]I hate that one.
[118:10.34]Oh, the one I just did right there kind of sucks.
[118:12.22]I hate when I do that.
[118:15.24]I have a very high-pitched voice.
[118:19.26]I think that I'm great, and I'm perfectly comfortable being me.
[118:23.23]That's good.
[118:24.17]That's a skill.
[118:25.13]That's a superpower.
[118:25.67]That's narcissism.
[118:26.83]You have a problem with it.
[118:28.01]Oh, yeah, narcissism?
[118:31.39]Wow.
[118:34.69]I've been told I sound like a kookaburra, if you know what that is.
[118:39.41]What's that?
[118:40.77]A hookah bar?
[118:41.99]You're a pretty kooky guy.
[118:43.69]I'll play it while we're playing.
[118:51.02]Why'd you waste a photo on that?
[118:52.86]I'm reporting you.
[118:53.66]What?
[118:55.22]Why'd you take a photo of these extinguishers?
[118:57.92]I didn't.
[118:59.31]I didn't.
[118:59.79]I didn't.
[119:00.63]No, you heard this.
[119:02.39]Yeah, I see.
[119:04.21]I swear to God, I don't know.
[119:07.97]I wouldn't take pictures of anything like that.
[119:10.51]Did anyone just laugh weird?
[119:11.56]You guys hear that?
[119:12.44]I heard a weird laugh.
[119:18.84]Yeah, that's my weird laugh.
[119:21.42]Oh.
[119:25.96]Ha ha ha.
[119:26.78]Ha ha ha ha ha ha ha.
[119:29.18]That's just the guy from Dexter's lab.
[119:31.06]Yeah, you know, I'm just trying to, you know... Sprint to the left, sprint to the left.
[119:38.46]Go run in, sprint to the left.
[119:39.50]Jerma, run, sprint left.
[119:41.11]With light or without light?
[119:41.83]I'm gonna get so many points.
[119:43.35]With light, sure.
[119:44.51]Run, sprint left.
[119:45.09]Yeah, that's good.
[119:49.69]No, no, no.
[119:50.27]Too much sprinting, too much sprinting.
[119:52.01]Too much?
[119:53.07]Get the squid.
[119:54.19]Someone get grabbed.
[119:58.19]Uh, I don't... Okay, that's dead.
[120:01.11]No.
[120:04.23]Yeah, I think this game has text chat.
[120:05.55]I'll just start using that instead.
[120:06.65]I'll just start muting up, guys.
[120:09.29]Wait, wait, what?
[120:10.01]Why?
[120:11.21]Oh my god!
[120:16.18]Oh my god!
[120:19.32]This is a really bold couch.
[120:26.36]Red like this?
[120:26.96]That's insane.

[120:45.21]Yeah, your legs gone These things, you know good points from this guy
[121:07.76]Legs were just over my head.
[121:09.70]There's no way that's zero points.
[121:13.04]The tips of my toes just touched the ground behind my head.
[121:16.60]There's no way that's worth zero.
[121:18.42]Can you not talk about toes?
[121:21.49]And why not?
[121:23.29]Gout sensitivity.
[121:25.63]Oh, okay.
[121:27.49]You could be like... What is going on in here?
[121:29.35]What the fuck?
[121:32.41]Call security, guys.
[121:35.20]Yeah, why are we so shocked by a room like this?
[121:37.02]What was that?
[121:37.94]I don't know.
[121:40.56]My audio got weird.
[121:42.60]I thought I was gonna walk in there and see some, like, diabolical shit.
[121:45.48]Okay, dude, he walked in here and he was like, what the fuck?
[121:48.94]So I just kind of pretended to, like, be excited too, because it's where we're streaming, you know?

[122:05.31]Good LOL moment!
[122:06.85]Alright, I'm leaving.
[122:09.49]I'm going to bring my stuff back to the helicopter because I have a lot of good photos.
[122:13.09]Alright, well be careful because there's going to be a 700 foot tall lady out there.
[122:21.47]Whoa.
[122:22.41]Oh my god, we got... Now we got the military escort.
[122:24.35]Ooh!
[122:25.87]Military's here, but I don't see anything... Yeah, I'm a... Yeah, be careful because they will shoot rockets.
[122:31.73]Oh, he does have a rocket launcher.
[122:35.60]We got to get him shooting the rocket launcher, right?
[122:38.44]What's going to happen?
[122:45.54]Did he just shoot the tree?
[122:48.95]I don't know.
[122:49.47]It was fucked, whatever it was.
[122:53.99]Oh, come on.
[122:56.33]Everybody's dying.
[122:59.33]Be careful.
[122:59.87]Play careful.
[123:06.13]No, I will.
[123:09.96]How did he not get hit by that?
[123:12.60]Dude, he's picking up the hotdog cart.
[123:17.30]Where's the helicopter?
[123:25.37]Did you just fart?
[123:27.93]How am I supposed to know?
[123:31.23]No, I blew my nose.
[123:31.86]I thought you just got up and farted into the microphone.
[123:35.17]like I've been holding that in yeah I thought you had to blow my nose dude I thought you got up and stood on your chair turned around and bent over and farted into the bike I was like holy that was crazy
[123:46.94]No, I'll be honest with you.
[123:48.53]I've never farted on stream.
[123:51.35]Me either.
[123:51.65]I'm way too paranoid.
[123:52.59]Yeah, me too.
[123:54.47]I hate the thought of it.
[123:55.85]There's like a weird sound.
[123:56.97]Like what if it's not what you intended?
[123:59.93]Yeah, it's something about having anybody else hear that.
[124:04.06]No, that's a flashlight.
[124:05.36]Poke, you're probably the same way, right?
[124:06.80]Like if any human being is going to hear you fart or know that you did, it's like that is the worst thing ever.
[124:14.02]You don't want anyone to know that you've just farted.
[124:17.03]I fart like a cat shits.
[124:21.41]Do you fart on your loved ones?
[124:23.19]Do I fart on my loved ones?
[124:24.67]No.
[124:25.01]No, like near, near.
[124:28.01]No, absolutely not.
[124:28.95]I'm just staying here now.
[124:30.43]You know what?
[124:30.99]I'm actually...
[124:33.26]You know, I actually really needed to hear that because Gigi never, like, my loved one never farts near me.
[124:38.83]And I thought there was a problem.
[124:40.17]But now hearing that someone else is like you, her, you know?
[124:43.89]Oh, yeah.
[124:45.09]There's no way.
[124:45.97]Sorry, guys.
[124:46.39]I just found something really funny just now.
[124:48.47]It was like I was thinking to myself something that happened like a couple hours ago.
[124:52.19]Well, we all have our little quirks, right?
[124:54.08]Like, I don't like to fart around anybody.
[124:59.15]I also don't like ovens.
[125:00.25]I don't like tape.
[125:01.25]I don't like balloons.
[125:03.14]I don't like bright LED lights.
[125:05.76]I don't like garbage truck sounds.
[125:08.52]I don't like snowmen.
[125:09.84]I don't like carrots.
[125:11.18]I don't like the sound that a fan makes when it's a little too close to the wire in your computer.
[125:15.85]I don't like lava lamps.
[125:17.89]You know what I really hate?
[125:18.79]If someone's eating a pizza,
[125:20.67]Like, let's say we're eating a pizza, me and you, right?
[125:22.51]You're on one chair.
[125:23.05]I'm on the other chair.
[125:24.09]He's in the middle of us.
[125:25.65]You take a slice.
[125:26.75]You take a bite and you put the pizza back.
[125:30.02]You put the pizza that you ate on another slice.
[125:34.16]Whoa.
[125:34.58]Or when someone has, like, a long sleeve shirt and they're grabbing, like, grabbing food over a table and their shirt touches the food.
[125:40.72]For anyone who wasn't here.
[125:42.01]Oh, come on.
[125:42.45]Yeah, that's horrible.
[125:43.43]I agree.
[125:44.13]I hate that.
[125:44.51]Yeah.
[125:45.29]Yeah, I hate that.
[125:48.77]Oh.
[125:50.05]I started feeling... I couldn't breathe for a bit.
[125:52.15]It's a breeze.
[125:55.27]Yeah, but... You like lava lamps?
[126:00.14]Every time I buy one, it breaks before I bring it home.
[126:03.10]What?
[126:04.42]I've never had one work.
[126:05.58]I'm getting super into it.
[126:07.60]I love these things.
[126:08.80]I genuinely... I'm not even kidding.
[126:10.96]I love lava lamps.
[126:13.08]It should be remade.
[126:13.86]Why don't you sell a lava lamp?
[126:18.13]No drama.
[126:18.57]Jerma-themed lava lamp.
[126:19.85]It's like green and pink and blue and shit.
[126:21.93]That actually would be awesome.
[126:22.61]Can you figure out the business?
[126:23.53]And I'll be on your line, too.
[126:25.47]And I'll have my own poke lava lamp.
[126:27.31]We have a Ster lava lamp.
[126:28.93]A Vinny lava lamp.
[126:29.59]It could be a whole four-horseman line of lava lamps.
[126:32.72]Bro, I'm so down.
[126:37.28]Dude, lava lamps could be better, too.
[126:39.22]I feel like they were left in the 60s.
[126:42.58]We could engineer a new-age lava lamp.
[126:48.35]Wait a second.
[126:50.74]I feel like we're on to something here.
[126:54.22]What would your colors be?
[126:55.96]What kind of wax would you have?
[127:00.64]Talk your shit about two minutes?
[127:02.52]Yo.
[127:03.76]Termite, you tell him.
[127:06.58]Tell him what, Poke?
[127:07.69]There's nothing really to talk about.
[127:11.09]Oh, yeah, you're right.
[127:11.85]Yeah, I mean.
[127:12.81]Okay.
[127:13.35]We're going to be fucking rich.
[127:14.95]Holy shit.
[127:15.86]You think I'm gonna let these two fucking assholes in on this?
[127:17.90]Like, dude, that's odd.
[127:19.22]50-50, you and me.
[127:20.18]Yeah.
[127:20.84]Wait until you see these results.
[127:22.14]I have to share the love, you know?
[127:23.20]It's just how I am.
[127:24.14]Wait until you see these results.
[127:25.06]Oh, yeah, that's very patriotic.
[127:29.30]That was him shooting the wall.
[127:32.33]Why is that?
[127:33.13]What is that?
[127:33.75]Why is that worth... Why is that worth more than this?
[127:38.57]Alright, alright.
[127:42.57]Well, we all did pretty good.
[127:44.66]I think it's because I was in the thing's mouth.
[127:48.12]Alright, we did it.
[127:56.52]I opened up Jerma's chat for a second just to see what they were saying.
[128:00.01]One guy said lava lamps were in the 90s, not 60s.
[128:08.01]I clearly have missed a lot of conversation.
[128:12.29]That's what he retained.
[128:13.67]He retained that shit.
[128:14.57]Don't worry about it.
[128:16.85]If me and Pogue have a business venture that is a 50-50, 51%, 49% venture, then that's what we're talking about.
[128:26.32]I feel like they deserve to know.
[128:31.06]I'm pretty sure there were lava lamps in the 70s that burned people's skin off.
[128:34.50]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[128:43.52]I'll DM you later.
[128:44.02]What are we buying?
[128:44.74]I just bought a flashlight.
[128:48.06]They used real lava in the 70s, yeah.
[128:49.74]You didn't see?
[128:50.70]Just acid.
[128:51.77]Yo, I think low-key we should have walkie-talkies.
[128:55.39]Maybe if I animate it.
[129:00.07]Wait, you were telling me to look at the picture.
[129:02.73]Oh, yeah, see?
[129:05.84]I got a plan this next one.
[129:09.22]Bloody nose.
[129:11.34]That's a great shot.
[129:13.37]That's a cool, that is a great shout out.
[129:16.27]Some good things on sale, stranger.
[129:20.44]What are you buying?
[129:22.26]And more importantly, what are you selling?
[129:26.92]Dude, is that Beholder in here?
[129:29.50]These are some good ones.
[129:30.24]These are pretty good.
[129:32.48]Wait, I have an idea.
[129:32.98]It disappeared.
[129:37.45]You'll see later.
[129:37.91]Are we ready?
[129:39.57]Yeah, let's go guys.
[129:51.48]I thought lava lamps were 1800s.
[129:56.28]You don't even know what we're talking about.
[129:58.80]Alright.
[130:00.08]Let's let him in on it.
[130:01.17]Alright.
[130:06.83]Oh, my God.
[130:07.33]I just laughed so hard.
[130:08.13]It hurt.
[130:09.15]That hurt my chest.
[130:10.01]How hard I just laughed.
[130:10.91]Did you hear that?
[130:12.87]Yeah.
[130:13.01]Oh, my God.
[130:15.84]I might need to take a minute.
[130:20.12]uh we're gonna have some godzilla on this could be godzilla but I wonder if the tall man would also show up I saw that I like that what just the way you're in tune with your character whoa wait something like a helicopter blew up or something it's not ours that's all that matters
[131:03.01]Bagels are better than just normal bread sandwiches.
[131:05.89]I'd rather have a bagel than just like a loaf of bread or something.
[131:09.51]I feel like normal bread is, uh, you're an idiot if you're doing normal bread.
[131:13.23]Like there's so many options.
[131:14.21]I've been on tortillas.
[131:16.78]Bagels.
[131:17.64]Bagels are like chewing gum, dude.
[131:19.06]They take nine years to go through your digestive system.
[131:21.36]I'm not a fan.
[131:23.53]What?
[131:24.73]I don't do bagels very frequently, but yeah, I mean, they're good.
[131:30.29]I just don't do sandwiches on them.
[131:31.71]It's like it over.
[131:33.01]You know what?
[131:33.45]It overrides the sandwich.
[131:35.29]That's how I feel.
[131:36.57]Maybe right.
[131:37.59]I think cream cheese is the best, though.
[131:39.86]This.
[131:40.14]Ew, ew, ew, ew, ew.
[131:43.44]Jive cream cheese?
[131:44.74]Jive an onion?
[131:45.18]Cream cheese for a bagel is the best thing ever.
[131:47.02]Yeah.
[131:47.96]You got a tomato?
[131:49.52]I just don't like cream cheese.
[131:50.74]Whoa, what the fuck is this place?
[131:51.82]I'm with you, Poe.
[131:56.77]Wow, that's another surprising look.
[131:58.45]What is this thing?
[132:01.29]It's alive.
[132:02.15]It's alive.
[132:06.30]Is it?
[132:07.48]Don't startle it.
[132:09.38]You killed it.
[132:11.32]No, it's not dead.
[132:25.09]I wanna get a good picture.
[132:28.21]What the?
[132:34.24]Does it hurt?
[132:41.38]No.
[132:42.24]I'm trying to get it in the air.
[132:47.44]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[132:48.62]I can get on his head.
[132:49.82]Ow.
[132:59.52]Are we the monsters?
[133:00.88]Hello?
[133:04.80]It's like this thing is not even able to hurt us and we're just like throwing corpses at it.
[133:12.18]I keep getting stuck in doorways.
[133:13.86]It tends to happen.
[133:18.50]Poke you with us?
[133:19.04]Oh, he's right there.
[133:20.08]Yeah, I'm here.
[133:20.46]Can you hear me?
[133:21.81]Yeah, there you are.
[133:23.65]What happened?
[133:24.75]We, we, uh, we... Oh!
[133:28.07]No, chat, all of us were throwing that bomb.
[133:30.29]Oh, shit!
[133:30.65]Oh, shit!
[133:31.37]What the hell's going on?
[133:32.87]Why am I getting freaked out?
[133:33.69]What is that?
[133:34.25]What happened?
[133:35.34]Oh, it's that guy again.
[133:36.68]What the fuck is going... No, no, no.
[133:39.34]Sorry.
[133:40.10]Goddamn.
[133:41.54]Uh, Poke, the best part about that was you were, you were like, why am I getting freaked out?
[133:48.28]Wow, why am I scared?
[133:51.89]I love it.
[133:52.35]That was great.
[133:52.89]Ping pong.
[133:59.51]Digital monsters.
[134:02.92]Yeah, kind of.
[134:22.52]Pushes up glass.
[134:23.30]There's no attack going on at all.
[134:26.18]What was that?
[134:28.16]It was a ghoul.
[134:29.72]Where did it go?
[134:30.72]I don't know.
[134:31.10]A duende just ran past me.
[134:35.16]The wendigo?
[134:35.78]No, duende.
[134:37.60]You know what a duende is?
[134:40.63]No.
[134:41.47]Duolingo?
[134:42.17]No, no, no.
[134:48.83]I think I got like... Was that appropriate to call like a... like a dog?
[134:54.22]2,000 points?
[134:54.48]Maybe 1,000 points?
[134:56.16]Little creature?
[134:56.76]Hey, this wasn't the wall.
[135:04.86]This is paranormal.
[135:08.27]There's nothing in here, guys.
[135:10.69]I didn't click.
[135:25.56]Yeah, how do I?
[135:26.16]It's over here.
[135:28.24]Where Jerma?
[135:29.04]Don't see it.
[135:30.08]Isn't it straight ahead of this egg thing?
[135:31.96]Oh no, wait, it's not.
[135:33.88]How do we get out of here?
[135:36.19]I don't know.
[135:37.37]I know follow my voice.
[135:40.79]We have four minutes.
[135:43.05]Yeah, we gotta like... That was insanely complicated to get out of there.
[136:11.70]Are you okay?
[136:12.36]Okay.
[136:12.70]I think we're good.
[136:13.48]Marco... Yeah, doing just fine.
[136:15.06]It's time to leave.
[136:22.99]I bet it's gonna be fine out there.
[136:25.07]Um... Like a weird... Oh.
[136:29.07]This one aimbots.
[136:30.95]This one aimbots.
[136:31.65]I'm telling you... You can't get past this guy.
[136:39.69]Oh.
[136:39.83]We're like...
[136:42.84]How are you supposed to get away from this shit?
[136:45.15]How are you supposed to... I knew it was going to crush me.
[136:51.11]You too, huh?
[136:58.48]Oh, wow.
[136:58.74]He just barely didn't get hit by that.
[137:00.72]He's probably going to leave.
[137:07.52]I hope Poke has good photos.
[137:13.65]No!
[137:17.43]No!
[137:19.65]Oh God.
[137:21.13]Is the one... By the way, manholes are just... They're just landmines.
[137:29.58]They're landmines that don't beep.
[137:31.90]It's horse shit.
[137:37.98]We had like good photos too.
[137:39.74]I did at least.
[137:40.67]We did.
[137:42.34]No, I had something special in there too.
[137:48.28]Where'd all the money go?
[137:57.63]We lost all of our money.
[137:59.73]Everything is gone.
[138:00.86]We're failure journalists.
[138:02.42]I mean, we can make like 4K in one turn.
[138:07.52]We've done it before.
[138:08.14]We can definitely do it.
[138:10.36]Alright, here's the plan everybody.
[138:12.20]This is what we'll do to make the money back.
[138:23.77]Let's make cash.
[138:41.81]We gotta split up.
[138:44.63]Sir, sir, what's wrong?
[138:45.67]Because every time I'm near Jerma, something bad happens.
[138:52.30]Something doesn't feel right about this place, guys.
[138:55.32]I got a bad feeling about this jury.
[139:00.24]I'm going in this one.
[139:01.96]This one's easier to leave.
[139:03.24]Alright, yeah, I'll also go in this one.
[139:05.82]Alright, where do you want to go poke?
[139:09.10]Alright, let's go this one.
[139:20.65]Little rat on the ground?
[139:21.81]The same little patrol guy.
[139:22.85]Okay, let's see if I can get this on my face.
[139:30.48]Like, if this jumps on my face, make sure you get a good picture.
[139:33.70]Maybe it's going to run into a landmine with that guy running.
[139:37.32]Oh, shit.
[139:37.80]That's right.
[139:38.60]Oh, shit.
[139:39.14]Right here.
[139:41.31]Oh.
[139:50.40]I'm okay.
[139:51.96]She's running.
[139:52.40]Oh, she's running.
[139:52.92]No, no, no.
[139:53.32]Run this way.
[140:01.57]Are you dying?
[140:02.57]No, it takes one HP.
[140:05.21]Oh, she's going.
[140:05.93]She's going.
[140:07.45]I'm trying to point her toward this way.
[140:09.62]Get a picture.
[140:10.52]I'm going.
[140:11.14]I'm lining up.
[140:11.68]I'm lining up.
[140:13.26]Right there.
[140:14.34]Oh, come on.
[140:14.94]Do it.
[140:16.80]Shit.
[140:18.76]Right there.
[140:20.67]No, no, no, other way, other way, other way, other way!
[140:29.02]Come on!
[140:32.50]She is so close.
[140:35.42]Come on, step on it!
[140:38.46]Come on, do it!
[140:39.24]Oh, fucking poke, get ready!
[140:48.13]I got it!
[140:48.57]I got... I got simple!
[140:50.61]What?
[140:52.05]I got it right before it exploded.
[140:54.88]Dude, I was gonna go... Did you get it?
[140:58.18]No.
[141:00.88]I put my camera down because I was just gonna run on it.
[141:03.14]That's why I was saying I'm putting my camera down and we just both didn't get it.
[141:06.18]That's so funny.
[141:06.86]I missed it.
[141:08.30]Oh, man.
[141:08.74]It's up close.
[141:14.06]Any more things for people to step on?
[141:34.08]Oh, perfect.
[141:34.66]Okay.
[141:35.56]Let's see if we can get him to run in here.
[141:39.40]I'll go, I'll go find him.
[141:45.94]I think he's dead.
[141:46.54]Alright.
[141:52.20]Rat's coming in.
[141:52.86]Rat's coming in.
[141:53.36]Rat is heading your way right now.
[141:55.26]Rat's turning the corner right now.
[141:56.38]Get ready.
[142:02.31]He's... Oh my god, don't move.
[142:04.35]He's literally looking at it.
[142:05.11]He's looking at it right now.
[142:05.90]He's sniffing the mine.
[142:07.80]No!
[142:08.20]I'm okay.
[142:20.19]We're trying to get somebody to walk on this.
[142:32.26]Uh, hello?
[142:33.26]I think I'm okay.
[142:33.76]It just respawned me in the front.
[142:46.69]I'm here.
[142:48.01]It teleported me to the front.
[142:49.19]Why would you put your area code in your name?
[142:53.57]I don't fucking forget.
[142:59.25]I wonder, okay.
[143:00.64]Do the elevators do anything?
[143:04.88]No.
[143:05.14]We'll go in.
[143:06.06]I can't.
[143:08.03]I think we should start walking back.
[143:09.43]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[143:11.47]Guys, we're leaving if you can hear us.
[143:35.86]We gotta get out.
[143:36.32]We gotta get out.
[143:39.16]Ster.
[143:50.65]Why did I follow him?
[143:54.71]I like the echo in this.
[143:55.77]There is no way we're going to get through that, by the way.
[143:58.29]Shut up.
[143:58.85]Follow me.
[143:59.61]Put your head down.
[144:00.45]Stop being such a coward.
[144:01.85]Follow me.
[144:03.21]Go.
[144:17.46]He fucking disappeared!
[144:19.00]Where did he go?
[144:21.38]Ster?
[144:26.51]Where did he go?
[144:51.88]Hello?
[144:52.14]Uh-oh.
[144:52.36]I think I went to heaven.
[144:55.34]This is what it's like.
[145:24.60]wait a minute I can move the camera what am I looking at you can see it's like dripping okay well whatever uh I guess I'll join again
[145:55.75]I wonder, can I just rejoin?
[146:02.98]Kind of.
[146:03.28]Dude, not only did I come back to the game, I got an extra life.
[146:12.28]You understand what I just got?
[146:13.18]I got an extra life.
[146:17.15]No, I didn't.
[146:17.53]Wait, what?
[146:27.05]I mean, should I just take pictures?
[146:28.55]I don't... I don't know.
[146:32.83]It's not safe for me to do anything, really.
[146:38.02]Where even is it?
[146:53.48]Three?
[146:56.74]Hey!
[146:56.96]Hey!
[146:57.22]I'm here!
[146:57.48]I'm here!
[146:57.70]I have all the cameras!
[146:59.56]I have all the cameras!
[147:00.48]Come on!
[147:03.82]Come to my voice!
[147:04.60]Over here!
[147:04.92]To my voice!
[147:05.34]Get in!
[147:11.91]No!
[147:13.75]I got all the cameras!
[147:14.69]Oh my god!
[147:15.21]You are an absolute hero!
[147:20.10]Absolute!
[147:20.40]What a clutch!
[147:30.32]Well, I got kicked across the map and then I got to see the great water effect screen from heaven and then I got to respawn.
[147:42.87]Oh, oh, I thought you were dead.
[147:45.47]That's a good strategy.
[147:46.07]There's gotta be a lot of points.
[147:46.97]Guys, I got all the cameras back.
[147:51.11]That's a good one.
[147:55.07]Action taxi.
[147:58.31]wow broad shoulders dude that whoa yeah I know I jumped all the destruction probably I guess that matters huh oh damn we just kind of destroyed it takes me back to my childhood we did it we made it to the next tier we're back to where we were before lads we did it that's crazy
[148:26.46]It was a 1.8 times post-apocalyptic multiplier.
[148:30.57]What is that?
[148:33.19]I got no points for that.
[148:34.21]You got a picture of a rooftop.
[148:37.67]That's an amazing picture.
[148:38.65]It's not worth anything.
[148:39.47]That's a beholder and it was also exploding just right after that.
[148:43.62]It just exploded.
[148:44.82]I feel like that's worth more than 300.
[148:50.06]Who did this?
[148:52.36]Turma keeps... He's a failure.
[148:58.41]This is nice.
[149:00.75]Put those two back up there.
[149:02.89]That's a wallpaper right there.
[149:06.72]Put my two fire extinguishers back up there.
[149:08.46]Fire hydrant photographer.
[149:13.56]I got a picture of you with the fire hydrants.
[149:20.85]What do we spend our money on, fellas?
[149:23.98]I don't know.
[149:24.58]I definitely didn't buy anything.
[149:26.00]There's a flashlight on the table.
[149:27.63]Spent a lot of money, in fact.
[149:29.21]Hey, buddy.
[149:29.43]Someone take this blue camera.
[149:30.67]This blue camera is better.
[149:32.37]What does it do?
[149:33.25]It's 15 shots.
[149:34.35]Ah.
[149:37.49]Let's take the flashlight.
[149:40.55]You and your flashlight.
[149:42.43]I... Listen.
[149:43.03]I like to see where I'm going, what I'm doing.
[149:48.94]You said flashlight, didn't you?
[149:50.70]I did.
[149:51.08]That reminds me of when I...
[150:00.11]Four people died.
[150:00.81]Four people.
[150:03.74]Four people.
[150:05.04]Well, I can't just report on poor people dying.
[150:07.04]We have to find like real stuff.
[150:08.88]Lock it in.
[150:12.14]Those words are that thems is fighting words in New York City.
[150:16.52]We are at our PB right now.
[150:18.82]We need to get to 6000.
[150:23.70]I'm telling you, all we have to do is find one freak, take a photo of it, like a lot, and then just run back to the chopper real quick.
[150:31.27]I know we can do this.
[150:32.25]This needs to be like Tony Hawk, where if you hit the same backflip, it starts to get diminishing points.
[150:36.71]Mm-hmm.
[150:38.49]Oh, yeah.
[150:42.01]Up there.
[150:42.37]Like, you can't dark side grind forever, you know what I'm saying?
[150:45.40]What is that guy?
[150:48.33]Yeah, like, let's just farm the squid and leave.
[150:52.83]Yeah, that's a great idea.
[150:55.78]I'll take photos.
[150:56.20]We gotta let it grab someone.
[150:57.38]Alright.
[151:01.22]Well, we gotta be funny with it, though.
[151:03.04]Hold on, hold on.
[151:04.22]Okay, three of us get in frame and, like, dance.
[151:11.03]Okay.
[151:15.99]We'll all take... Let's do it like a wedding, okay?
[151:18.77]Like... We're gonna take like a thousand pictures here.
[151:21.91]Let's get the groomsmen up here, please.
[151:23.21]Are we dead?
[151:29.10]What the fuck is happening?
[151:30.06]Is anyone?
[151:31.02]No, he got thrown.
[151:31.88]Oh.
[151:31.94]He's gonna get up again.
[151:32.88]Alright, so... I'm already at like 4,000 points or more.
[151:38.74]So, Ster a dance?
[151:39.72]Stop hitting it.
[152:04.63]This is getting a lot of points.
[152:13.44]Dude, that was a good one.
[152:15.22]I'm out of film.
[152:26.75]I still got plenty of pictures I could take.
[152:29.41]Watch out for that knoblin.
[152:34.17]Hold on, he's chasing after this guy.
[152:38.17]Yeah, we got to get in front of this.
[152:41.69]I got a 12,000 point because I saw Kramer.
[152:44.77]Yeah, yeah.
[152:46.21]Where's Dremel, Dremel, Dremel?
[152:47.18]I'm right here.
[152:47.52]TMZ is buying this shit.
[152:49.56]What is it?
[152:50.56]Do you see the blue on my camera?
[152:52.82]The blue?
[152:54.38]Yeah.
[152:55.40]Yeah, you got a blue light?
[152:58.28]What about over here?
[153:00.84]No, it's...
[153:02.84]It was bugged on your screen, right?
[153:05.26]Vinny?
[153:06.34]Yeah, it was bugged.
[153:07.24]It's weird, the blue light.
[153:09.86]Alright, never mind.
[153:11.00]So did we win?
[153:11.54]Oh!
[153:14.08]Yes!
[153:16.51]Oh, he's alive!
[153:18.45]Oh, I didn't even know that's what was going on.
[153:20.33]Guys, I don't think it's possible to get a worse photo than I just did.
[153:30.72]I looked away for one second.
[153:32.69]I lived because I have the boots with the life.
[153:34.77]Can somebody give me the peace sign or something?
[153:37.49]I'd be the worst juggler.
[153:41.83]That's a good one.
[153:45.25]I like how we're leaving before all the real good shit is happening.
[153:48.77]Did we actually just kind of farm this and metagame it in a way?
[153:55.93]That's crazy.
[153:56.43]I wonder.
[153:58.21]I'm pretty sure we're good.
[154:00.27]We won.
[154:01.53]Oh, you can't do this on stage seven.
[154:10.28]They need to, like, fix this, maybe.
[154:11.88]Like, they need to do what you said, Ster, the Tony Hawk.
[154:14.88]Nice.
[154:19.39]Ooh.
[154:26.01]Damn.
[154:26.91]That's a good one.
[154:30.76]Why is that 980?
[154:32.64]Photo sucks.
[154:36.78]Well, we got 3,300.
[154:37.24]Let's just do that one more time.
[154:43.05]Can we have a pee break?
[154:44.53]I have to pee.
[154:45.81]Guys, isn't it more about the story?
[154:46.79]Oh, you see score repeated photo?
[154:48.43]Oh, yeah.
[154:51.67]They Tony Hawk'd us.
[154:53.89]It is real.
[154:56.46]Alright, well, you know what?
[154:57.96]The first one gives you points.
[154:59.84]We still did good.
[155:00.62]Uncommon pulpo.
[155:02.91]Pulpo?
[155:04.43]Wait, look at my attempt of the... I actually really tried to take a photo of the thing.
[155:12.89]I like this one.
[155:14.62]That's nice.
[155:18.14]I thought I took one of Jerma with his fire hydrants, but I guess not.
[155:20.82]Oh, yeah, I thought you did.
[155:22.87]It was like the first photo you took.
[155:23.85]You could screw it up if you take the wrong photo first for everybody.
[155:28.05]Oh shit, OK.
[155:30.55]That maybe people putting up is actually.
[155:35.09]I really have to pay after this one, so let's make it happen.
[155:38.33]Are we going?
[155:38.61]You're holding it.
[155:39.35]Yeah, I'm good.
[155:45.77]Oh wait, we actually... You can do that, I think.
[155:48.74]Be careful.
[155:49.08]Uh...
[156:13.12]Is he pissing?
[156:14.08]In Liar Liar, Jim Carrey, the judge is talking to Jim Carrey and he's like, has to go to the bathroom really badly.
[156:21.44]And he looks at the judge, he goes, oh, I know if you hold it for too long, blah, blah, blah, blah, blah, your kidneys in a bay.
[156:25.73]He says all this shit that's bad about it.
[156:28.41]And then the judge goes, is that true?
[156:29.93]He goes, it has to be.
[156:31.57]It's my favorite part of the whole movie.
[156:35.85]Is that your favorite Jim Carrey's movie?
[156:37.81]I think just like him in the court is like one of my favorite Jim Carrey movies.
[156:42.85]But what's your favorite Jim Carrey movie, like overall?
[156:45.71]Oh, The Mask, a hundred times in a row before every other movie.
[156:49.97]That fits so perfectly with you, Jerma, though.
[156:52.57]It's like, I get it.
[156:54.81]The first memory of Jim Carrey for me is him pissing and it's splitting into two because he had sex.
[157:01.12]You know what I'm talking about?
[157:01.94]What movie was that?
[157:03.12]Oh, that's from Me, Myself, and Irene, isn't it?
[157:05.88]Yes, yes.
[157:08.32]Yeah, he goes to pee and it's like, it goes two ways.
[157:11.56]He had sex.
[157:13.51]I was like, oh, I didn't check.
[157:14.21]I think about that every day.
[157:16.22]That's how that works, huh?
[157:17.46]Same, same.
[157:18.84]Same, bro.
[157:20.98]I think anything.
[157:21.76]Yeah, she split me in half.
[157:23.92]The Jim Carrey movies are kind of like the Ernest movies.
[157:26.43]It's like eight of them in a row.
[157:27.99]They're all great, and just you should watch all of them.
[157:30.97]Yeah.
[157:32.47]I was just talking about Ernest the other day, too.
[157:34.25]That's wild.
[157:37.33]Jerma, do you ever get called Willem Dafoe?
[157:38.81]We're like children of Ernest.
[157:40.77]What was that?
[157:41.23]Willem Dafoe?
[157:42.45]Does Jerma ever get called... You ever get called that guy?
[157:46.56]I've heard of the resemblance before.
[157:47.94]I have an emote on my channel.
[157:49.06]I was watching the Spider-Man movie and I saw the Green Goblin.
[157:53.58]I'm like, that's Jerma.
[157:54.86]What the fuck?
[157:55.79]One of the greatest actors of our generation.
[157:57.55]One of the most kind.
[157:59.51]He's one of the best.
[158:00.53]One of the greatest probably living people.
[158:02.23]I was watching Nosferatu and I was like, wow, that's the Green Goblin.
[158:08.59]He was gobbling it up, the scenery.
[158:10.37]I honestly would not even... It wouldn't even surprise me if an Ernest remake with Willem Dafoe was what they were doing.
[158:22.21]That would not surprise me.
[158:23.15]That would make sense somehow to me.
[158:24.85]They're doing a Naked Gun remake with Liam Neeson.
[158:30.49]Oh, that's right.
[158:30.93]Isn't it Seth MacFarlane's executive producer or something?
[158:34.72]Might be, yeah.
[158:37.65]I feel like if there's somebody that you want to make a Naked Gun movie, it's probably Seth MacFarlane.
[158:42.73]Sure.
[158:43.11]I mean, no one else does comedy anymore.
[158:44.27]I can joke every ten seconds.
[158:46.21]Thought I heard a Squirtle.
[158:53.30]I'm looking for it.
[158:58.62]I know.
[159:02.62]What are you taking?
[159:03.06]What are you doing?
[159:03.46]Of the three major melons, which one is the tastiest?
[159:05.91]You're taking pictures of just red shit?
[159:07.57]Is that what this is?
[159:08.11]No, no, you'll see.
[159:11.07]I don't think there's any monsters in here.
[159:16.79]Watermelon.
[159:18.71]I don't know, chat.
[159:19.51]I gotta be honest.
[159:20.37]I don't agree that watermelon's the best of the three melons.
[159:25.19]Wait, that's crazy.
[159:35.25]Oh, he went into the vent.
[159:36.59]It's us.
[159:37.01]I actually am like an omega cantaloupe hater.
[159:38.37]I hate it.
[159:40.99]It's alright.
[159:42.03]It's fine.
[159:42.71]It's fine.
[160:05.21]So you like watermelon?
[160:07.09]I love watermelon.
[160:07.95]I love it.
[160:08.25]I like watermelon too, but I think I like cantaloupe a little better these days.
[160:15.02]I feel like I've eaten cantaloupe that's been tough way too many.
[160:18.10]It's just kind of chewy, rindy.
[160:20.22]I'm not a big fan of it, especially when it's rindy.
[160:24.62]Okay, fair enough.
[160:25.53]Guys, we...
[160:33.24]I do like the flavor of a honeydew melon though.
[160:35.40]Dude, that's good action.
[160:38.12]Or is the tree blocking?
[160:39.82]That's true.
[160:40.59]That's fair.
[161:04.16]How about pineapple?
[161:04.80]You like pineapple?
[161:05.98]That's probably my favorite fruit.
[161:08.06]Pineapple is my favorite fruit in general.
[161:11.88]Oh, well, you are 10 times more intelligent than I ever thought you ever were.
[161:15.83]And I always thought you were very smart.
[161:18.55]See, now that's the good stuff.
[161:20.43]That's the good stuff.
[161:21.67]You know what's good.
[161:23.35]Watch out.
[161:24.57]We're going to get kicked.
[161:28.08]We have to stay to the right.
[161:29.92]And I think we can get behind the building.
[161:32.23]What's your favorite fruit, Star?
[161:33.49]Tell me now, quickly.
[161:36.61]Uh, strawberry?
[161:38.31]Oh, that's another favorite of mine.
[161:39.85]Very good choice.
[161:40.51]That's a good pick.
[161:43.37]Where's your camera?
[161:51.02]Where's the camera?
[161:52.82]Where's the camera?
[162:01.25]I think someone got the sewer right.
[162:04.25]Was it Poke?
[162:04.99]Oh no.
[162:05.61]I'm gonna make a run for it, guys.
[162:17.84]Okay, go!
[162:27.46]I guess I'm dead.
[162:33.40]Wait, Poke is alive.
[162:34.56]I didn't even know where he was that whole time.
[162:39.12]He's just getting really... We are distracting so much.
[162:42.54]He's just getting great photos.
[162:45.46]Poke can save this whole run.
[162:47.67]That's going to hit him.
[162:51.69]He was so tunnel vision.
[162:52.77]He didn't even know that happened.
[162:53.83]He's staying still.
[162:55.03]Dude, he's perfectly still.
[163:00.15]He's like Zen right now.
[163:02.09]Come on, he can make it.
[163:03.41]He's going to make it.
[163:15.44]He's got two and a half minutes.
[163:17.30]What?
[163:18.18]It's a dead end.
[163:18.78]What the hell is the point of this?
[163:20.00]What, Ster?
[163:20.86]Ster's doing it.
[163:21.90]He's making progress.
[163:24.38]I feel like it passed Poke.
[163:27.98]I think Poke is fine.
[163:28.80]I think so.
[163:32.45]Yeah, this is coming for Ster, right?
[163:34.75]As I've done before.
[163:37.55]He's stuck.
[163:38.49]Oh.
[163:52.09]It's alright, so at least I did the bug again.
[163:55.39]At least Ster made it.
[164:04.65]he's committed to it he's committed to the camera should I go back for it oh no he shouldn't go back for that camera he probably has so many points on that camera he already has yeah he's just gonna leave I I see his camera hello there's a bunch of on that on at least if it was mine you think you got enough I got two cameras oh okay

[165:52.74]The zoom camera.
[165:54.22]I want the sport shoes.

[166:01.77]I bought a flashy camera.
[166:02.59]I feel like the sport shoes is worth it.
[166:04.65]I got zoom.
[166:05.81]Wait, this pro camera is nice.
[166:07.43]Oh, yeah.
[166:07.83]Also, the shoes have saved my life like a bunch.

[166:22.08]Ooh.
[166:24.61]If you take a picture in the lobby, does it count?
[166:32.33]I don't know.
[166:32.67]That's a good answer.
[166:35.11]This is just what my phone sees every time I pee.
[166:41.43]What?

[167:32.23]So let me explain how that works.

[169:13.85]What the fuck?
[169:22.73]My abs hurt.
[169:37.93]Watch out for this little fucking weirdo.
[169:45.03]Dude, this guy has one wrestling move from a 2000 N64 fucking game.
[169:55.76]Dude, you guys ever play No Mercy for the N64?
[169:58.06]Wait, Vinny, where are you?
[170:02.58]Vinny, talk!
[170:04.04]Vinny, scream!
[170:04.74]Vinny!
[170:15.54]That was 50 points?
[170:16.96]What?
[170:17.20]I heard Vinny scream.
[170:46.08]Whoa, ghoul, ghoul, ghoul, ghoul.
[170:50.24]I'm stuck.
[170:51.12]He just vented.
[170:51.78]I'm telling you, the other place was better.
[171:02.41]There was an octopus right in the start.
[171:05.09]Let's go.
[171:05.41]Well, at this point, Godzilla's probably outside.
[171:13.79]Godzilla gives a little money.
[171:16.36]Yeah, we should always be trying to get a Godzilla picture.
[171:20.00]It is the wrestling move.
[171:28.38]Oh yeah, it is!
[171:29.89]I know what you mean now.
[171:36.77]Yeah, I tried to get that out in three seconds.
[171:39.61]I don't know how well I was explaining it.
[171:47.37]Wait, wait!
[171:47.63]There's a bomb right there!
[171:49.61]What?
[171:52.41]There is a bomb out here.
[171:53.33]Where is it?
[171:57.79]You guys want me to die for the money?
[171:59.15]Take my stuff home?
[171:59.73]I have a leg to throw at it.
[172:02.20]Go for it!
[172:14.64]I can't throw the leg.
[172:18.32]I just drop it.
[172:20.04]None of us have legs.
[172:20.90]We need to start going back.
[172:22.54]I'll do it.
[172:22.86]I'll do it.
[172:23.38]I'll do it.
[172:23.64]Hey, wait, wait.
[172:24.16]Take my camera.
[172:24.90]Take my camera.
[172:25.80]That's a good camera.
[172:28.07]We got to get one of these at least once, right?
[172:29.65]Okay.
[172:31.35]Alright.
[172:32.07]You ready?
[172:33.43]Wait, wait, wait.
[172:34.51]Why do I hear an ice cream truck?
[172:36.27]That little monster that was going to run up to you, maybe you kill it with it and we get more money.
[172:39.61]Yeah.
[172:39.87]Good idea.
[172:40.43]Okay.
[172:41.91]Where is he?
[172:42.31]Where is he at?
[172:44.09]So if I stand on it, it won't blow up, right?
[172:47.48]Yeah.
[172:50.00]That don't- What?
[172:55.10]Huh?
[172:56.38]I thought if you stood on it, it didn't blow up.
[172:58.87]That's what I thought.
[173:00.93]You stood on it for a very long time.
[173:03.99]I know.
[173:05.27]So I was doing a bit with the funny voice and I was getting killed the whole time.
[173:12.99]You guys were just talking and I was getting killed.
[173:15.96]I heard you scream at one point.
[173:17.58]I've tried to run back and find you, but it was the last scream you did, for sure.
[173:21.32]That's alright.
[173:22.60]Now my zoom camera is gone forever.
[173:28.04]Strange tornado creature.
[173:30.30]Oh, why am I not watching what they're doing?
[173:31.70]What the fuck am I doing?
[173:32.58]No, but I know about it.
[173:34.96]Yeah, I played a little bit yesterday.
[173:36.16]It's actually cool.
[173:41.88]Is there a particular reason you bring it up, or?
[173:45.83]Okay, well, I mean, I was sponsored yesterday, but I had a really good time playing it, and I want to play it later.
[173:50.10]Oh, I... Not much I can say.
[173:52.54]Hashtag ad.
[173:54.16]No, it looked fun.
[173:54.80]I've seen a lot of people play it.
[173:56.28]I actually want to play it.
[173:57.65]Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.
[173:58.61]Do you play the first one?
[174:01.73]What is it?
[174:02.15]I don't even know what it is.
[174:03.58]It's like a medieval kind of gigantic RPG with a bunch of choices and a ton of.
[174:08.92]It's just like a very vast, very long medieval RPG.
[174:14.28]First person.
[174:15.32]You can do third person too, I think too.
[174:20.88]Benny, you've played it.
[174:22.77]What?
[174:24.03]No, I'm not talking about enshrouded.
[174:25.13]I was talking about Kingdom Come.
[174:29.45]I played enshrouded.
[174:30.47]It's pretty good.
[174:32.66]It was a little junky, the first one at least.
[174:35.23]It was kind of janky, but it was charming.
[174:38.92]It was fun.
[174:39.28]I was going to maybe play the second one.
[174:44.25]Yeah, I saw like a lot of my friends were streaming it today.
[174:46.39]So I don't know.
[174:47.95]I mean, I don't know if I have the patience for another long RPG personally.
[174:52.90]Yeah, but I don't know.
[174:53.76]It just looks like it's it's like a tornado.
[174:55.50]It's just spinning stuff around.
[174:59.12]Anybody in either of our chats here know how long it actually is?
[175:02.74]Like how long is the first one and the second one?
[175:05.90]Like I guess in ballpark.
[175:12.44]Um, are you going to play Monster Hunter drama?
[175:16.64]Uh, the new one, when does it come out?
[175:18.14]Yeah.
[175:19.45]And like, I don't know, this was like a month chat.
[175:25.51]I would play it.
[175:27.57]Like three weeks, yeah.
[175:29.73]OK, my crazier is a lot of stuff coming out.
[175:31.90]I feel like a lot of actually decent games have been coming out the last couple weeks.

[177:38.41]Not even Shakespeare would write comedy into his play.
[177:41.35]It's worked for me for 15 years.
[177:42.63]Listen to the reverb on the cut part, listen.
[177:48.22]It just cuts out.

[182:57.68]I readjusted my seat.
[183:02.34]Poke, Poke, you're wearing a helmet.
[183:04.86]You just look like you're the only person prepared in the worst way.
[183:10.20]Like, that helmet's not going to do shit.
[183:11.40]You guys are ruining the vlog.
[183:18.90]I thought he was gonna get cracked.
[183:22.78]Yeah, sorry for getting scared.
[183:23.78]He was fast, damn.
[183:46.84]Any demons?
[183:51.11]We have to take the best photos so we get no repeats.

[186:38.41]I was tabbed out for a second.
[186:58.42]What?

[187:54.71]Hey Vinny, did you know that the T-Rex sound from Jurassic Park was a French horn?
[188:27.36]Stuart is still alive.
[188:29.50]How is he doing that?
[188:31.12]I don't know.
[188:31.80]Dude, the boots are sick.
[188:36.67]He's just standing there.
[188:38.25]There's no way he's going to make it through this.
[188:44.07]Hello?
[188:48.15]Anyone still alive?
[188:49.07]Oh, he could get such a good picture right here.
[188:55.83]The way you died is so brutal.
[189:00.70]He ate me.
[189:03.50]He chewed me up.
[189:10.45]He's being a nature documentary filmmaker right now.
[189:14.98]You better have some great though.
[189:16.20]That was a perfect landscape.
[189:18.52]You better have taken a great photos for the cameras.
[189:30.03]I that dog that dog could kill me.
[189:31.87]I think I'm the last person.
[189:35.86]He doesn't know that he can crouch walk up to there, Jim.
[189:38.96]He could actually get the two cameras and he hasn't.
[189:42.19]Oh, wow.
[189:43.09]That's going to be an incredible blunder.
[189:46.35]If I can't leave, then whoever else is alive is going to be able to get that last camera.
[189:56.60]You think Vinny's going to go for the cameras?
[189:58.66]I don't think so.
[190:05.56]I'm actually kind of glad he doesn't have that camera, considering I took a picture of my bare ass with it into the bathroom mirror.
[190:11.22]I don't think they're getting back.
[190:12.89]I'm glad he's not going to recover that one.
[190:14.33]He needs to get it.
[190:15.87]I wish I could just deposit the camera.
[190:20.01]Give it to this guy.
[190:20.97]Yeah, I think he's opting to go for it here.
[190:27.75]I think he's going to go for it here.
[190:38.30]Oh, he actually did.
[190:42.94]Dude, he was a fucking loot goblin.
[190:49.44]Any legendaries or epics drop out of there?
[190:51.48]I got to be really honest with you guys.
[190:55.78]I kind of fucked that up.
[190:57.84]I had a photo that was like 1,200.
[190:59.78]Shouldn't have grabbed anyone else's cameras.

[191:58.10]That was insane.
[191:59.52]The shoes are OP, though.

[192:05.74]I bought a Ranger boot.
[192:07.50]Yeah, I don't want to blow all of our money.
[192:09.82]I bought one helmet.
[192:10.66]I kind of blew all of our money.
[192:12.06]Are you really sick?
[192:12.80]If I die, someone take my boots.
[192:14.15]Yes, I'm actually sick.
[192:15.69]Oh.
[192:17.47]When you look up and talk, it's so funny.
[192:20.01]How do you equip the boots?
[192:21.13]Ginny, you bought the wrong shoes.
[192:27.89]What is going on?

[193:14.74]Let's win the next round.
[193:15.52]We have to win this one because I want to see it.
[193:17.46]We have to win to see it.
[193:18.77]You have to put the helmet on.

[193:27.99]Or Watt Bob.
[193:29.51]SquarePants.
[193:38.25]Dude, don't you hate when you say, I want a quiet ride on the Uber and the Uber driver just fucking talks to you.
[193:49.43]He's got to tell you his lifestyle.

[194:03.79]I love getting like trues in the chat.
[194:05.37]This is the first level again.
[194:06.55]I love it.
[194:08.16]It was like a higher difficulty.
[194:10.88]I guess so, yeah.
[194:12.00]Looks like it.
[194:23.54]There's a lot of rooms.
[194:24.52]Are we going to see a ghost?
[194:27.20]Oh, yeah.
[194:27.50]There's definitely going to be a ghost here.
[194:29.16]A glizzy ghost.
[194:32.62]Uh, I think we're missing one.
[194:33.96]Uh, we are missing.
[194:35.04]We're missing Poke.
[194:36.62]Yeah, fuck him.
[194:56.77]Poke!
[194:59.72]Poke!
[195:02.43]Hmm, I don't know.
[195:17.72]Yikes!

[195:34.38]Hello?
[195:35.66]Oh, hi.
[195:37.36]Yeah, we're in here.
[195:37.88]We're just watching this weird news program.
[195:44.32]Weird news program?
[195:45.72]This program.
[195:54.47]Someone just asked if I can read.
[195:55.63]Uh, yeah.
[195:59.35]I think I probably would.
[196:01.47]If I could, I would put it in the back.
[196:09.22]Where you guys at?
[196:09.80]You guys in the... Hey, ladies and gentlemen, breaking news!
[196:17.59]A man's about to get killed in a funny video game for a YouTuber clip.
[196:22.57]God, we all know it's coming.
[196:26.39]It's always coming.
[196:27.29]You don't really see anything in here.
[196:34.18]It's a nice desk.
[196:35.12]I don't know.
[196:35.72]I just heard the F and you cut it off.
[196:37.46]I was... I still fell off.
[196:38.39]Honestly, I feel like you can... I'm fucking crying!
[196:40.05]What the fuck, man?
[196:40.83]What the fuck?
[196:41.17]Why is it...

[198:09.02]I'm staying up really late, I'm eating junk on the couch and watching movies!
[198:12.36]I'm gonna be in big trouble!
[198:19.73]Maybe I really am alone.
[198:23.17]I'll go up.
[198:46.00]I have one leg.
[198:46.98]There's no way I make it back.
[198:50.67]I don't even know what direction to walk in.
[198:53.29]Is it right or left out of here?
[199:09.60]I am not making it far.
[199:10.71]I think it's left.
[199:43.39]Slow and steady wins the race.
[199:53.90]Are you shooting me with the rockets?
[201:13.38]Dude, I got a roaring mouth!

[202:42.46]Oh my god.
[202:43.48]That's an XCOM like this one, sir.
[202:48.26]Sir, that one.
[202:49.78]That rocket hit me.
[202:50.66]What was that?
[202:51.46]That's you dying.
[202:52.44]That's one of you dying, I guess.
[202:54.82]I don't know, man.
[202:57.34]Where's the one inside of his mouth?
[202:58.96]Oh, shit.
[202:59.94]We made it in one try.
[203:02.52]Dude, these pictures are amazing.
[203:03.72]These are the best pictures we've had the entire time we've been playing.
[203:07.22]Oh, my God.
[203:07.92]These are crazy.
[203:08.58]Yo, Jerma, that monster killed me instead of walking around as me.
[203:14.99]Yeah.
[203:15.61]Wait, what?
[203:16.11]I got a pretty good picture of it.
[203:17.15]Those, yeah.
[203:18.45]You turn into, like, a zombie if one of those kills you.
[203:20.87]Wait, what?
[203:22.25]Yeah, I saw, like, a zombie Jerma, like, punch me in the face before with one of those.
[203:26.89]Is that what happened earlier?
[203:27.77]Yeah, you attacked me.
[203:28.61]You kind of, like, you were, like, running at me.
[203:29.89]See?
[203:30.13]Look at how menacing you are.
[203:33.74]What the fuck?
[203:34.42]That's a good picture.
[203:35.66]Whoa.
[203:37.10]That's what I took, yeah.
[203:38.34]It was on my face.
[203:41.81]That's the one before we had.
[203:48.45]Radiohead the bends.
[203:49.59]Dude, look at this one.
[203:52.65]Look at how sick this one is.
[203:53.73]But hold on.
[203:54.07]Wait, wait, wait.
[203:55.05]Look at that.
[203:55.59]Come on, man.
[203:56.35]That's cool.
[203:57.11]That should have been like a top three.
[203:58.55]This was zero points?
[204:00.45]That I would want to see on the headline.
[204:02.45]That's crazy.
[204:04.64]Sorry, zero.
[204:07.24]Must have been a repeat.
[204:09.62]Yeah.
[204:12.21]Can you stack helmets?
[204:13.29]Can I wear like three helmets and have 175 health?
[204:16.11]That's how it works.
[204:27.90]I guess you could do helmet plus boot.
[204:31.05]We could probably afford better cameras too.
[204:32.71]I think everybody should get a backpack as well.
[204:36.41]A $50 backpack?
[204:37.53]Heck yeah.
[204:39.29]Oh yeah, that sounds awesome.
[204:40.77]Extra slots.
[204:41.43]Let's go.
[204:42.37]Yeah, I'll buy a couple of those.
[204:43.49]I'll buy a better camera.
[204:49.55]Okay.
[204:52.22]I bought shoes.
[204:55.30]I want the pro camera, I think.
[204:57.80]Actually, no, I'll give you the light.
[204:58.90]I'd rather have the light.
[204:59.80]I got the pro one.
[205:00.88]I'm pretty... I think I'm happy with it.
[205:04.06]I got the normal.
[205:07.34]Oh, I feel a lot faster with these new shoes, actually.
[205:09.58]Just default.
[205:12.50]Wait, never mind.
[205:16.24]Alright, cool.
[205:16.72]Uh, 13,000 it is.
[205:18.44]Okay.
[205:25.57]Yeah, you wonder what happened last round?
[205:28.98]No, basically what I did was.
[205:30.50]I was gonna say not really.
[205:36.12]Oh, this is a floor every time and then I don't expect it.
[205:39.33]This is a three guys.
[205:41.99]We are doing one that has the same rating as almost every McDonald's in America.
[205:47.67]Three like a 3.1.
[205:51.67]Is that just the median of American, like, best taste?
[205:56.50]I think it's just if you have a fast food place that's near you, if it's Burger King, McDonald's, doesn't matter what it is.
[206:02.56]If that shit is rated higher than a 3.5 on Google, on Yelp, that is a keeper.
[206:09.84]Right.
[206:10.22]I don't think I've seen in a long time.
[206:11.85]Most of the ones around here are like 4.5.
[206:14.23]People don't fuss.
[206:17.25]Yeah, you're right.
[206:18.15]What?
[206:18.37]Where do you live again, sir, generally?
[206:19.89]I'm with sir.
[206:22.99]It's rare to see one like as low as a three.
[206:26.01]Yeah, make sure you show it on stream.
[206:27.39]Like, allow my location on Chrome.
[206:30.57]All the... Sir, you're wrong.
[206:33.69]Oh, shit.
[206:36.08]Yeah, go on Google Maps and just type McDonald's and just, like, on your phone.
[206:40.44]And just scroll through the ratings.
[206:42.42]McDonald's, maybe, specifically.
[206:44.52]McDonald's.
[206:45.08]McDonald's, Burger King.
[206:46.58]McDonald's.
[206:47.06]McDonald's, they're all 3.5.
[206:51.97]Or even lower.
[206:52.77]Okay, that's pretty big.
[206:53.79]Anything over a 3.5 is... Oh, they can't hear me.
[206:56.19]God damn it.
[206:56.65]Sorry, people from Elizabeth.
[206:57.37]Oh, there's a Wendy's with a 4.0.
[207:11.83]There's a McDonald's with a 3.7, 3.8.
[207:13.57]Wow, this is interesting, Jerma.
[207:16.23]Those are actually pretty high.
[207:17.39]Those are high scores for McDonald's, honestly.
[207:19.91]Can we enter this McDonald's and talk about it?
[207:22.81]This is a big... Beholder.
[207:31.94]I thought they were at the forest, too, with Ster.
[207:34.84]That's crazy.
[207:36.41]I think I don't, I don't normally eat McDonald's.
[207:38.89]I think that society has escalated above McDonald's and you get like Chick-fil-A and stuff now.
[207:43.80]Yeah, that's, that's just the crazy thing to say.
[207:48.04]If McDonald's was as cheap as it should be, I'd be fine with it.
[207:51.08]Dude, I'm sorry.
[207:52.02]Shake sack.
[207:53.58]Shake.
[207:55.38]Shake.
[207:56.02]Shake shack.
[207:58.59]You know what?
[207:58.93]Nevermind.
[208:00.68]Jerm, Jerm, listen.
[208:02.50]I love Shake Shack.
[208:03.76]There is a burger place in Manhattan called Hamburger America that has the best fucking burgers I've ever had.
[208:09.21]They're smash burgers.
[208:11.07]It's like a celebrity burger chef makes them.
[208:13.39]It's incredible.
[208:13.99]I don't know why I'm telling only you this.
[208:18.07]Don't let that thing touch your face.
[208:19.83]Jerma, Jerma, let's try it.
[208:21.99]Not again!
[208:22.91]Not again!
[208:24.17]Oh!
[208:24.83]Wait, I'm fine.
[208:26.07]I got it off.
[208:26.67]I got it off you.
[208:27.49]Dude, my pictures stink.
[208:29.13]Why?
[208:29.52]They're not worth anything.
[208:36.73]Sorry if I overreacted.
[208:38.47]That's okay.
[208:40.59]We're YouTuber.
[208:41.41]I get it.
[208:42.83]No, that's not what I do.
[208:44.83]That's not what you do.
[208:45.99]You know what's funny too?
[208:49.99]Same here.
[208:50.43]I'm like, I don't do that.
[208:51.33]And then I play a game like this and I scream.
[208:54.65]Oh my god.
[208:55.23]I don't play scary games.
[209:00.63]I can't do anything if you play scary games by yourself with a camera.
[209:16.94]That one was a thousand.
[209:19.10]I just got a thousand.
[209:20.85]Can one of you guys get grabbed by this?
[209:23.13]What is that on the floor next to it?
[209:24.91]A hand.
[209:37.26]You can dance in the air.
[209:39.54]I got a thousand.
[209:40.54]Okay, we need to get out of this room, though.
[209:43.54]It's going to be a repeat.
[209:44.68]We wasted a lot of time talking about McDonald's, and by wasting, I mean it was very valuable.
[209:49.27]Okay, I'm sorry.
[209:50.15]Okay, we're going to have to leave and get back to the helicopter.
[209:53.49]I'm sorry.
[209:53.87]I want one McDonald's in this country with, like, a big chef.
[210:07.48]isn't it uh isn't in Japan don't they don't they take it like really really seriously in Japan I want a Japanese McDonald's yeah 7-eleven over in Japan's amazing too KFC as well yeah I've heard that like everything's better in Japan dude whoa well that was odd

[210:31.80]You guys are being pricked on.
[210:35.72]I'm being pricked on.
[210:37.02]That was a good one.
[210:37.60]That was going to be... Okay, we need to get the fuck out of here.
[210:48.41]No, dude.
[210:53.37]Come on.
[210:54.49]I'm done.
[210:55.17]I'm done with this game.
[210:57.67]I'm done with this.
[210:58.61]Oh, of course.
[211:05.85]They probably got the best shot.
[211:08.17]Why did you look?
[211:09.07]It makes your camera look down, chat.
[211:12.35]Like what the fuck, guys?
[211:14.09]Wait, who's dead?
[211:14.55]Are you dead?
[211:15.39]I'm dead too.
[211:16.19]Yeah, I died.
[211:16.75]Oh, I'm dead.
[211:17.41]I died around the same time you did.
[211:19.31]I watched you go over the sewer cover.
[211:25.16]Every time.
[211:26.40]Do you notice them or is it just me?
[211:29.78]I can't even see them, but you have... Thank God you're stepping on them because it would be me every time if it wasn't you.
[211:36.35]Cool.
[211:38.67]It's these shoes that make you go faster.
[211:42.59]Okay.
[211:43.99]The shoes that make you old.
[211:47.38]Oh, no.
[211:48.12]I had a lot of stuff.
[211:52.46]That's the worst part, is that we're losing all our good stuff.
[211:56.02]I watched Doctor Strange.
[211:59.32]Last night, the first time.
[212:01.82]The first one?
[212:02.72]Which Doctor Strange did you watch?
[212:04.48]The first Doctor Strange.
[212:05.78]Oh.
[212:06.60]Dormarmu, I'm here to bargain.
[212:08.14]Don't worry, it gets worse from there.
[212:11.46]I liked it.
[212:12.25]It's good, yeah.
[212:13.03]Doctor Strange is a good one.
[212:14.39]At least the first one is.
[212:15.15]I liked the first one, yeah.
[212:16.87]I don't care.
[212:20.29]He's just like a fake Doctor House sniping him, though.
[212:24.53]But, time.
[212:25.73]Alright.
[212:27.27]Kind of is like a Doctor House.
[212:30.29]Everything pre-Infinity War was great.
[212:33.87]It was really fun.
[212:34.73]It was really fun.
[212:35.41]I don't care what anybody says.
[212:36.19]Limb, limb, limb, limb, limb, limb.
[212:37.29]Count it.
[212:38.16]30 limbs.
[212:39.14]Which one, Jerma, did you say?
[212:40.48]I'm sorry.
[212:41.32]Everything pre-Infinity War, pre-Endgame, was cool.
[212:45.10]It was fun.
[212:45.74]It was good to be a part of it.
[212:47.74]Anything post-Endgame, I think, is absolute dog shit.
[212:53.40]I think there's been... Yeah, I was just talking about this the other day on my stream.
[212:56.96]Is Endgame Thedos?
[212:59.13]Yes, Thanos.
[213:01.25]I like Thanos.
[213:03.25]I like Thanos as well.
[213:05.27]He's good.
[213:06.01]It's just you can't come down from Thanos.
[213:09.59]I like Thanos.
[213:10.99]But the thing is, I didn't watch the other movies, and I'm watching them now, and I'm starting to like them.
[213:15.77]Yeah, they're good movies.
[213:16.89]I mean, there's even a couple post-Thanos that aren't bad.
[213:19.51]It's just when you build up movies like that, and then you finally get to Thanos, then what?
[213:25.29]Yeah.
[213:26.09]You know?
[213:27.98]I was just hoping he was going to keep snapping over and over and over again just to see what happened.
[213:31.32]Stupid.
[213:34.70]Fun.
[213:37.65]Everything wasn't total dog shit.
[213:40.71]Now, Guardians of the Galaxy 3 was good.
[213:42.99]WandaVision was fun too.
[213:44.43]It had its moments, I think, at least in the beginning.
[213:47.81]Yeah, I like the concept.
[213:50.97]And then after WandaVision, I tried watching, I think, one other one.
[213:53.98]I was like, I'm good.
[213:56.66]You know, I haven't seen Loki.
[213:57.82]I've heard people like Loki.
[214:04.01]Weepo.
[214:11.80]Hey, thanks, sir.
[214:12.58]Appreciate your contribution.
[214:14.65]We were talking about DC.
[214:17.87]We were talking about, yeah, Thanos.
[214:20.19]And then you won.
[214:21.47]So thanks.
[214:22.05]Yeah, that was really cool of you.
[214:22.99]Do you like Thanos?
[214:25.11]I do.
[214:25.77]He's my favorite character.
[214:29.45]Yeah, he's pretty cool.
[214:32.65]Cool.
[214:33.75]That's awesome, man.
[214:39.25]Wow.
[214:41.00]It looks like you're taking these for this monster's Instagram.
[214:45.36]Like he hired you to do that.
[214:47.86]He did.
[214:48.74]He was strutting.
[214:49.48]Like get some candid photos of me kind of like destroying a city.
[214:55.09]Wow.
[214:55.63]Halfway.
[214:57.03]Wait, we're owning.
[214:58.39]We actually are doing very good.
[215:00.59]How do we do it?
[215:01.31]Like when it says it gives us press badges, what is that for?
[215:03.94]That's our actual life, right?
[215:12.02]Oh, I think it is life.
[215:14.52]Does anyone need this flash camera or no?
[215:18.46]What is that?
[215:18.82]I don't know.
[215:20.22]Someone bought it.
[215:20.84]Yeah, it's better.
[215:25.16]If you want it, feel free.
[215:26.22]I don't mind.
[215:28.09]I like this one a lot.
[215:32.53]That's a good crush.
[215:37.03]Oh, remember when Poke screamed?
[215:38.11]This is it right here.
[215:39.83]Oh, 500.
[215:42.27]Am I the only guy with a hat?
[215:44.27]Uh, right now you are.
[215:45.63]Oh, no, no.
[215:46.43]What's-his-name has a hat.
[215:47.29]Oh, okay.
[215:49.91]Yeah, what's-his-name.
[215:53.42]Wow, okay.
[215:55.22]I'll go wait in the helicopter.
[215:56.84]No, I wasn't sure which character you were, dude.
[215:59.12]I didn't know.
[216:00.24]I don't know.
[216:01.34]It could have been Jerm.
[216:02.12]I need a helmet.
[216:04.22]He's a what's-his-name guy.
[216:06.84]What's-his-name.
[216:08.26]I'm not from Jersey.
[216:11.09]Wait, what the?
[216:11.89]You're from New York.
[216:13.01]I'm a Staten Eyelander, man.
[216:14.71]Oh, same thing.
[216:15.31]It's not close enough, but we don't really have Taylor.
[216:18.21]I have such a bad sneeze coming.
[216:20.28]Fuck.
[216:20.68]Hold on.
[216:31.61]Yo, I'm getting told about this game called Zort.
[216:34.79]Did it work?
[216:35.39]I played Zort.
[216:36.92]Oh, really?
[216:37.72]I zorted the other day.
[216:39.22]I was zorting so fucking hard.
[216:42.24]Is it good?
[216:44.68]It's good.
[216:45.40]It's not like this.
[216:46.38]You can actually play it more linearly.
[216:47.92]You can finish it in two hours, but it's worth it.
[216:50.20]Oh, interesting.
[216:52.56]Put it this way.
[216:53.12]Since I completed it, I would not complete it again.
[216:55.70]I saw everything that game has to offer.
[216:59.24]Uh, yeah.
[217:00.46]I get it, I get it.
[217:01.22]But you get a couple homies that aren't me and you're gonna have a great time.
[217:04.60]Yeah.
[217:05.18]Okay, cool.
[217:06.76]Yeah, what's his name?
[217:12.59]Yeah, I think I am gonna play Monster Hunter.
[217:14.65]I think you asked like 40 minutes ago and I don't even know if I answered you or not.
[217:17.61]Thank you, Jerma.
[217:18.31]It's good to know.
[217:22.78]We'll play.
[217:23.28]Maybe we'll play.
[217:27.32]Those games are fun.
[217:28.18]I play it.
[217:29.00]I love... I... Okay.
[217:31.86]Oh, no.
[217:32.72]Oh, no.
[217:33.86]Oh, no.
[217:34.68]Oh, no.
[217:35.00]Oh, no.
[217:35.78]Oh, no.
[217:36.61]Oh, no.
[217:36.91]Oh, no.
[217:37.93]Oh, this was a short one.
[217:41.75]Yeah.
[217:43.62]You okay?
[217:45.06]Okay.
[217:47.06]Alright, let's hurry up and get this one done then, I guess.
[217:56.17]I don't want to be a Steve Urkel, but like, did I do that?
[217:59.63]Yeah, me.
[218:01.15]Did I do that or did Poke do that?
[218:09.47]Did I do that?
[218:11.24]I don't know.
[218:11.86]You were behind me.
[218:13.38]Yeah, I don't know either.
[218:14.29]I couldn't really tell.
[218:15.47]Maybe?
[218:16.85]Apparently, Poke is freaking out right now.
[218:19.63]I think I killed Poke.
[218:20.45]Oh, he left!
[218:22.89]Hmm?
[218:23.75]Poke just left the server.
[218:26.20]Oh, he hates us now.
[218:27.56]Dude, what the hell?
[218:28.24]Oh, no, he's back.
[218:30.42]Oh, did he, like, cheat to respawn?
[218:33.00]That sly dog.
[218:34.30]Yeah, you can't do that.
[218:45.09]wait why can we hear poke yeah yeah okay okay I'm gonna drop this camera at the front yeah it's like you're on top what the heck I have an experiment I'd like to try can we kill somebody like a thousand times and have them respawn like a thousand times wait they can hear me at my body now yeah we can hear you poke
[219:14.86]He's coming through like a megaphone.
[219:18.76]I'm getting a lot of points.
[219:23.84]Uh, somebody's following us.
[219:50.23]Alright.
[219:53.45]Yeah, we can hear him!
[220:00.77]Yeah.
[220:01.63]Definitely bring him so we can hear him talk.
[220:06.00]Is there a God of War character that's just kind of like a... character that just talks to you?
[220:14.38]Yeah.
[220:14.92]We have our own Mimir.
[220:24.08]I just realized I have no health.
[220:26.96]And no arm.
[220:36.38]I don't even know why I have three cameras.
[220:38.11]Did Vinny die?
[220:38.73]Oh, no.
[220:40.25]I think he might have.
[220:46.01]Vinny?
[220:47.97]Oh, now he's here.
[220:48.83]Oh, yeah.
[220:49.25]I have three cameras.
[220:52.31]Hey, folks.
[220:53.19]Hey, toss him up here.
[220:54.17]Can you speak?
[220:55.86]Yeah, you hear me?
[220:57.28]We hear you from your old body though.
[221:01.26]Okay, so you guys figured out what I'm doing now?
[221:03.88]Yeah.
[221:04.30]Oh, okay, okay.
[221:08.09]Okay, I won't do it again because now I understand the physics.
[221:14.19]So I'll die to be fair.
[221:15.13]Oh, take a nice picture of me.
[221:16.35]Ready?
[221:17.99]I'm about to go with this thing.
[221:19.27]Take a picture.
[221:20.29]Yeah.
[221:20.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[221:20.99]Both pokes.
[221:21.53]Both pokes.
[221:21.97]Yeah.
[221:22.11]What happens if you look at your dead body?
[221:23.87]Bring your own corpse with you.
[221:25.51]Sorry.
[221:25.95]Bring your own corpse with you into there.
[221:33.82]Yeah.
[221:34.16]Nice.
[221:34.44]Nice.
[221:34.68]Alright.
[221:35.10]I'm ready.
[221:35.44]Here we go.
[221:43.56]Only 495.
[221:46.17]368.
[221:46.43]Oh, we can still hear you.
[221:49.65]I think you're coming out of your hand, by the way.
[221:52.47]Yeah, don't worry.
[221:52.89]I'm actually out.
[221:55.03]There's a lot of ghouls up here.
[221:58.64]Oh, man.
[221:58.96]I think there's a movie about that.
[222:04.40]Yeah, this is pretty sweet.
[222:05.72]It's like idle hands.
[222:07.22]I'm just going to bring you back together.
[222:29.85]That's a lot of destruction!
[222:33.03]Yeah, there we go.
[222:35.38]Poke, can you say something through your hand again?
[222:37.06]Alright, I got him.
[222:39.98]Alright, Poke.
[222:44.98]Say something.
[222:49.08]Say something else!
[222:54.00]I gotta leave you.
[222:54.54]I'm sorry.
[222:54.82]I have to leave you, Poke.
[222:59.67]Pretty good photos.
[223:04.25]Where Ster?
[223:04.75]I'm right here.
[223:06.49]I'm right here.
[223:10.85]Did we do it?
[223:20.78]Bad, I made a mistake.
[223:22.76]He's going to be throwing that at us.
[223:24.96]Yeah, we got Howard.
[223:28.52]It'd be great if he threw it through the window.
[223:37.56]So Poke only died four times?
[223:40.40]Hey, I don't ruin these, right?
[223:43.36]No, I think we're good.
[223:44.32]I think we're gonna get it.
[223:51.27]Don't stand too close to the screen.
[223:52.57]Your eyes will get hurt.
[223:54.09]True.
[223:55.83]It's OLED though.
[223:59.22]Yeah, it's when you both blew up.
[224:00.34]Did you hit the bomb, Jerry?
[224:03.97]I have an earlier picture of him.
[224:06.01]We can go down in Zoom and enhance.
[224:09.01]Yeah, enhance it.
[224:13.06]What was that noise you just made?
[224:14.92]Did I make a... No, I didn't make a noise, did I?
[224:16.62]Did I make a... No, it's... Okay.
[224:20.80]You did the thing that Jerma did earlier, if you know what I'm talking about.
[224:23.88]I don't know.
[224:25.90]The cough, though.
[224:27.12]Oh, oh, oh.
[224:28.10]He just did it now with the laugh.
[224:29.58]Oh, you mean.
[224:30.16]Oh, let me pass that over here.
[224:39.59]Hey, let me pass it over here.
[224:40.57]Let me get that.
[224:42.49]Do you think if he coughs again at the same frequency, it would just break it again?
[224:48.64]What is going on?
[224:50.40]Does that make sense, Vinny?
[224:51.76]I think I get it.
[224:52.86]I just heard myself.
[224:53.88]What was that?
[225:01.96]My audio is good, right?
[225:03.51]Yes.
[225:03.93]Alright, cool.
[225:06.67]Because I worry about that.
[225:08.75]Yeah, you sound good.
[225:11.47]As long as I'm not lagging, you know?
[225:14.35]Don't lag.
[225:15.49]Dude, I'm buying sport shoes.
[225:32.56]No, seriously.
[225:34.30]Yeah.
[225:41.24]I was going to rejoin.
[225:43.23]Yeah.
[225:43.65]And tell us the rest.
[225:44.67]Yeah.
[225:45.29]Pretend to be a facehugger guy.
[225:47.91]Right.
[225:48.47]As I got to you guys, I actually got.
[225:50.01]Parasited.
[225:53.13]That's all.
[225:55.29]You had to be there.
[225:58.71]Yeah, I guess you were there.
[226:00.73]You just like made me look so stupid.
[226:09.79]Or this is a four star.
[226:13.53]This one is going to be rough.
[226:20.26]Higher rating a hotel was the more dangerous it was.
[226:23.74]These things are you can't play the game without these boots by the way.
[226:28.30]They're like a must have equipped.
[226:30.54]Yeah, I guess.
[226:35.80]Yes, it's over then.
[226:39.25]okay this level you need to finish quick because if you get the guy walking down the street then you can't finish it as we've learned hey did you know that if you spam x in Grand Theft Auto 3 that you don't run out of stamina yeah uh
[227:12.40]That was nothing.
[227:21.55]Check for bombs.
[227:23.99]There's just a whole bunch down there too.
[227:28.91]Why is it spinning?
[227:31.03]It like comes after you and blows up.
[227:34.89]I don't know how it works.
[227:49.15]What is this fake door?
[227:50.89]Is this a weird door?
[227:53.75]Going there.
[227:55.69]What the hell?
[227:59.25]Half the doors do that to me.
[228:04.34]Here bomb.
[228:06.28]Remind the Russian be.
[228:16.06]You're missing an arm there pup.
[228:17.95]Bro, what are these doors?
[228:20.42]Yeah, we can't seem to go through any of these.
[228:25.64]Hello?
[228:26.06]Hello?
[228:27.08]Oh, my audio was broken there for a minute.
[228:28.86]You guys can hear me now, right?
[228:38.59]Yeah.
[228:38.99]That was really weird.
[228:42.27]Is there anything even in here?
[228:43.21]I think this is bugged.
[228:50.80]And I'm not talking about these things.
[228:52.50]Yeah, let's get out of here.
[229:00.03]I think I hear the gigantic monster outside.
[229:23.15]Are we running out of here?
[229:23.87]Are we getting out?
[229:25.33]Yeah.
[229:39.18]You should be able to drive cars as stupid as you can.
[229:41.48]You can push though.
[229:50.17]Ooh, guns.
[229:51.88]Military has arrived.
[230:00.59]Yeah, we should go to Motor Town.
[230:02.47]Just walking.
[230:03.13]I was, uh... I was looking at that game, Poke.
[230:06.69]Is it any good?
[230:08.45]I like it.
[230:10.53]Water Town?
[230:11.93]Motor Town.
[230:14.84]Motor Boat?
[230:16.02]What are you doing in Motor Boat?
[230:19.54]Uh, it's just like...
[230:22.41]Imagine like a GTA server where you could do all the all the jobs without people there.
[230:30.33]Hmm.
[230:33.07]Like delivering, but it's all pretty good.
[230:35.57]It's like a truck driving deliveries, ambulance, taxis, cars.
[230:44.76]I might check it out in real life.
[230:49.24]It's not bad.
[230:50.00]Hashtag ad.
[230:56.97]Should we just sit here and take a ton of pictures of this thing?
[230:59.97]Oh my god.
[231:02.15]Damn it.
[231:03.91]I'm alive.
[231:04.15]I'm alive.
[231:04.57]I'm okay.
[231:22.63]Storage Hunter, right?
[231:23.93]Yeah, storage Hunter Jerma would love that.
[231:26.45]I really like that game.
[231:28.74]I played one similar to it before.
[231:32.90]It might be the same game.
[231:37.70]Storage Hunter simulator man.
[231:39.78]There's so many simulator games.
[231:44.97]It's crazy by the way.
[231:57.65]Alright, I'm good, I'm good.
[231:59.37]Sorry, that wasn't me.
[232:01.59]You were just... That was scary.
[232:10.47]I could have just waited until loading screen.
[232:11.93]I don't know why I didn't just wait.
[232:15.40]Got a pretty crazy photo.
[232:16.38]They all heard me just blow my nose.
[232:18.28]I'm just such an idiot.
[232:20.90]The bot knew?
[232:21.60]What did the bot know?
[232:33.06]Check its history.
[232:37.51]Close call.
[232:38.33]Close call.
[232:42.19]Close call.
[232:43.69]Destroy the towers, he said.
[232:44.99]Oh god.
[232:48.47]Oh, that's a good one.
[232:50.27]Wow.
[232:52.81]Oh, that's a rip-off.
[232:54.17]Mogged.
[232:55.17]What they would say nowadays.
[232:59.00]Kids would say.
[233:00.06]That's what they would say, yeah.
[233:01.42]It would be funny if you said that unironically and stuff, but yeah.
[233:07.79]I think we're about to be at a 4.5 star or a 4.3.
[233:09.65]I'll try to change.
[233:15.33]I'll try to change.
[233:16.03]I'll try to change.
[233:31.87]I know the score.
[233:32.95]Chad, I'm aware.
[233:33.81]That's why I said it.
[233:34.97]That's literally why I said it.
[233:37.75]I feel like we are the furthest to be in this game.
[233:40.33]I think we're the furthest people.
[233:42.23]Because those doors didn't even work.
[233:44.30]Yeah, we're rank one right now.
[233:46.36]Yeah.
[233:47.60]In the world.
[233:49.28]I'm happy about that.
[233:53.60]Oh, read the headlines.
[233:57.34]We actually have to read?
[233:58.06]We can read the headlines?
[234:02.13]Did you see this score?
[234:05.71]Sorry.
[234:07.29]Was it 7-1?
[234:08.35]What does that mean?
[234:16.22]Football?
[234:17.84]Football?
[234:18.84]Hey, how are my Chiefs doing?
[234:29.38]What's the Chiefs?
[234:30.46]Is that, uh, fort- fort- fortnight?
[234:33.58]Fort- fort?
[234:36.08]How about the cowboy bears?
[234:37.32]Is that what they call it?
[234:41.33]The cowboy bears.
[234:42.43]Yeah, I love them sport.
[234:46.65]Bunch of cutie patooties.
[234:50.83]We need a bunch of money.
[234:52.39]Did the- The bears score- score?
[235:03.02]The bear scorers.
[235:09.16]You need to be able to hug the civilians.
[235:12.17]Let them know it's all going to be OK.
[235:18.05]Everybody just vanished.
[235:19.81]They kind of did just vanish.
[235:21.45]This elevator probably works.
[235:23.87]I want someone to make sure they... Take my camera in case I fall down this fucking elevator shaft.
[235:28.95]Okay, you ready?
[235:30.23]I'm going in the elevator.
[235:31.97]And... Here we go.
[235:34.57]We're doing, like, our vlog.
[235:36.89]Okay.
[235:37.29]Hey, what's up, everybody?
[235:38.11]About to check out this elevator.
[235:40.41]There's two buttons on it.
[235:42.19]One that goes up and one that goes down.
[235:44.13]And it's all aluminum and steel inside of it, which is interesting because most elevators are made... I can't go in.
[235:49.33]Never mind.
[235:52.82]It's, uh, it's going in the video.
[235:54.38]I was really hoping that I was just gonna just drop.
[235:59.87]Gonna be the opening scene to the YouTube video where you think something crazy is gonna happen.
[236:03.73]Guys, this door isn't even working.
[236:07.51]I'm not kidding, I don't think- I don't think- I really think we're the furthest.
[236:11.06]Should we go into the other green building?
[236:15.44]They haven't developed this part of the game yet.
[236:17.44]There was some crazy shit that happened.
[236:20.81]I'm gonna go on the other one.
[236:22.05]There's just crazy shit going on.
[236:23.43]Don't worry about it.
[236:24.03]It's the usual.
[236:25.05]Tell them about the strategy guys you wrote.
[236:36.44]What the fuck?
[236:37.38]That just broke my headphones.
[236:39.30]It was a rocket launcher.
[236:40.78]It just broke my audio.
[236:43.72]Did you hear that?
[236:45.76]Dude, he was talking.
[236:47.55]Pretty loud.
[236:48.05]Pretty loud.
[236:50.69]Oh, no, it got him.
[236:52.63]It got... It's his hand.
[236:57.29]Ster died from the... Can we?
[236:58.19]Can we?
[237:19.52]Oh, we can't.
[237:22.02]Damn it.
[237:22.57]I thought we could go inside.
[237:26.07]You have no idea how excited I was to go in there.
[237:33.65]I was so happy to think we could go in there.
[237:39.93]Watch out.
[237:40.77]Yeah, I couldn't enter any room in that building either.
[237:43.77]How are you alive?
[237:46.00]I went in that door.
[237:48.14]That's where I was.
[237:50.03]And I couldn't enter any rooms in there is all I'm saying.
[237:52.45]You thought I died?
[237:53.19]Who would the sewer monster kill?
[237:55.35]Oh, I don't know.
[237:56.97]NPC maybe.
[237:57.61]You going up?
[238:04.44]Okay.
[238:04.76]I'm losing my goddamn body.
[238:11.64]Meow meow meow meow meow.
[238:13.82]Meow meow meow meow meow.
[238:18.31]Some of these windows are so detailed.
[238:21.83]Yeah, it's graphics, baby.
[238:25.94]That's graphics.
[238:27.86]Crazy what the internet do.
[238:32.98]Just say it.
[238:33.86]What?
[238:34.44]It's alright, sir.
[238:35.72]I know it's tough for you to say it sometimes.
[238:37.73]It's hard to comprehend.
[238:40.09]Why did we all come up here?
[238:41.35]He's dead.
[238:41.65]Oh.
[238:51.90]Wait, how do you get there?
[238:52.75]Just walk across.
[238:56.53]Oh, you're right.
[238:57.79]Oh, Vinny, you should jump into my camera, like into the lens.
[239:00.35]That would be pretty cool.
[239:03.43]Where are you right now?
[239:03.95]Good items.
[239:07.18]I'm up here.
[239:07.52]Can you see me?
[239:09.16]I'm up here.
[239:10.12]How far up are you?
[239:11.42]Oh, you're right there.
[239:11.96]Okay, ready?
[239:14.48]Which one are you, Jerma?
[239:16.76]I'm next to you over here.
[239:17.40]Alright, you ready?
[239:19.28]Okay.
[239:22.23]Oh, that's Ster.
[239:23.45]No, that's you.
[239:23.99]I'm right underneath.
[239:27.22]Wait.
[239:28.40]Wait.
[239:28.72]Way high up.
[239:31.64]What is this gas?
[239:34.88]That was so loud.
[239:36.30]Why is this so loud?
[239:38.28]Oh, my God.
[239:57.50]It's a tornado.
[240:10.03]By the only one alive.
[240:10.82]Try to get selfie selfie selfie.
[240:22.41]Yep, good idea.
[240:39.88]It's that picture on the internet where the guy's like and he's got his jaws like going right and he's like with the tornado behind him.
[240:53.56]Yep.
[240:54.78]How's that not worth more than that?
[240:56.90]Yep.
[240:57.04]Yep.
[240:58.06]Yep.
[240:59.98]Yep.
[241:01.14]Where are the boys at?
[241:02.46]I don't know.
[241:03.02]I lost him.
[241:04.32]I'm here.
[241:04.68]I'm here.
[241:05.16]I'm almost there.
[241:09.24]Yeah, here it comes.
[241:10.12]That's what I'm thinking of.
[241:16.73]Hope died, I guess.
[241:20.55]Yeah, he did.
[241:21.01]He stepped on a. More selfies.
[241:27.18]Selfies are hard to do.
[241:27.98]Because by the time you take the picture, you just the thing that you were taking the picture of the selfie with kills you.
[241:35.06]Yeah.
[241:44.46]I need to get a helmet.
[241:48.50]Whoa, what is that?
[241:49.58]Gasly?
[241:50.14]Oh, dude, what is that?
[241:51.56]I wonder if the next three pictures are going to be of it.
[241:54.43]Oh, what is that?
[241:58.97]Why is that better than the tornado?
[242:01.25]Oh, that's a really big point.
[242:08.39]Alright.
[242:11.43]We have one more day.
[242:17.52]I think we've won already.
[242:19.68]Yeah, we definitely won.
[242:20.76]In the eyes of the Lord, we definitely have won.
[242:25.50]Yeah, I think so too.
[242:26.10]I threw the body in the picture and it got more points.
[242:30.14]Why don't we, um, maybe we'll do this one and then we'll see, we'll gauge how we feel.
[242:33.40]How's that sound?
[242:35.18]Good.
[242:35.34]We'll talk about our feelings.
[242:36.50]Everybody get in the car.
[242:37.24]Alright.
[242:38.48]Everybody in the car.
[242:39.14]You sound so laggy.
[242:43.04]Who sounds laggy?
[242:44.48]Durr.
[242:45.71]Also, the longer we're in a circle... Who's Groot?
[242:48.95]We just took a picture.
[242:50.27]I'm out.
[242:50.83]Can you eat?
[242:52.01]Can you eat gout?
[243:16.17]Gout is not a physical thing on the foot.
[243:19.86]Wait, what do you mean?
[243:20.64]I thought it was like glue.
[243:24.76]No.
[243:25.44]Like a slime inside your foot that gave it pain.
[243:29.84]We are all fruit.
[243:30.90]It's all mental.
[243:35.12]If you can see dead people, then you can see the demon biting the foot, but that's about it.
[243:39.59]Gout is apparently acidic buildup.
[243:42.86]Yeah, it's like uric acid in the foot.
[243:46.09]Can you drink gout?
[243:48.75]Uh, maybe if you had a way to drain the foot, I don't know.
[243:51.41]Do you really have gout, sir?
[243:53.95]Yes!
[243:56.07]We've had this conversation before!
[243:57.84]I swear, like a year or two ago, last time I had it.
[244:00.58]How long have you had gout for?
[244:02.78]It comes and it goes.
[244:03.78]It's been like two days.
[244:08.04]Is this because you've sinned, or is this just because, like, you were born incorrectly?
[244:14.49]Well, a bit of both.
[244:15.21]A bit of both.
[244:16.19]You know, it comes from both angles.
[244:17.41]Whoa, wait, wait, wait.
[244:18.31]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[244:19.69]What the fuck are we listening to?
[244:22.18]Oh, I'm just being an asshole.
[244:23.42]I love you, sir.
[244:25.50]And I was born incorrectly, and then I just ate the wrong foods after that.
[244:30.24]And here I am asking if I can eat your gout, and apparently you're the one with the problem.
[244:37.05]Yeah.
[244:37.53]Uh, we lost- Oh, no we didn't.
[244:38.71]He's right here.
[244:39.57]I'm here.
[244:40.99]Yo.
[244:42.19]I just have a cold.
[244:43.63]I'm so sorry, Star.
[244:45.64]Jerma has worms?
[244:46.52]That's not fucking confirmed.
[244:47.66]I'm losing my mind.
[244:48.38]I- Wait.
[244:52.96]I hear a noise.
[244:54.46]A beep?
[244:58.98]It's in there, but we can't even get inside.
[245:00.48]It's like I'm- I'm dying.
[245:03.33]Can he- Can he go in there?
[245:06.26]Sometimes you can be like forced at it.
[245:17.65]Okay, I want to try something.
[245:20.29]Make sure you get this camera.
[245:26.47]Okay.
[245:27.35]Now please remove yourself from the room.
[245:32.16]Okay.
[245:35.86]Wait, what if you could point... I didn't get it off.
[245:43.20]Oh, you're alive.
[245:45.51]Yeah, that's weird.
[245:46.29]Hey, I'm fine.
[245:47.65]I got that exact moment.
[245:49.35]I got that photo at the exact moment.
[245:51.41]Did you?
[245:51.75]Oh.
[245:51.81]I didn't know it would knock you down.
[246:01.53]Well, do it again.
[246:04.52]I did.
[246:05.46]Chad, that should have been worth so much more points than it was.
[246:08.66]Yeah, sorry guys, I was fucking born different.
[246:12.12]What was that?
[246:14.66]What was that?
[246:23.40]Are we the four horsemen or are we the four weasels?
[246:26.04]I'm not sure.
[246:30.46]Oh man.
[246:31.85]Let me in!
[246:33.32]How did we get in?
[246:33.82]How did we just get in?
[246:34.48]This guy's from New Jersey.
[246:41.14]What is it?
[246:41.64]Oh, it's one of the facehuggers.
[246:44.90]Oh, I got a great picture out of that.
[246:47.08]I love that.
[246:47.66]That's one of my favorites of the night.
[246:51.99]Yeah, we really went to like... Oh, God.
[247:00.78]We went right to four horsemen.
[247:02.32]It should have been, like, four, like, mosquitoes.
[247:07.38]Mosquitoes, then, like, beavers, and then weasels, and then horsemen.
[247:12.30]Yeah, we went a little too quick.
[247:13.86]I found out that with the, you know, the Fantastic Horsemen that's coming out in the comics, when they started adding people, they just put fives and six on their jerseys.
[247:22.50]Like, they just, like, we're the Fantastic Four, and you're five.
[247:24.85]That feels kind of lame.
[247:27.29]Yeah, that's not, that's like...
[247:29.51]Okay, so there's four of us here.
[247:30.79]So who's who?
[247:35.57]I'm the... I'm the stretchy guy, but only with my toes.
[247:41.17]I'm the rock guy.
[247:43.77]And it hurts.
[247:45.67]Alright, yeah.
[247:47.09]Poke and be rock guy.
[247:49.77]The thing.
[247:50.19]And then what does that make me?
[247:53.15]Human torch?
[247:54.09]I want to talk more, but I sound so nasally right now with the sickness.
[247:57.83]I hate my voice.
[247:59.79]You know what I'm saying?
[248:02.67]Yeah, you get that congestion in the nasal.
[248:05.31]Yeah, I'm just so aware of the congestion, it got worse today.
[248:08.98]Sorry, y'all.
[248:12.06]It's laggy in here.
[248:13.44]Yeah, it's real laggy.
[248:15.66]What was that?
[248:16.40]Who blew their nose?
[248:17.46]Lag, lag, lag, lag, lag, lag, lag.
[248:20.48]It's so dark in here.
[248:21.30]Lag, lag, it's laggy.
[248:28.73]I'm sorry guys, it's late.
[248:37.14]Alright, I have 20 health, I can't do that again.
[248:42.06]I can't pay the fuck out of her.
[248:48.24]I said he almost peed himself.
[248:52.55]Weird.
[248:52.73]Who would pee themselves?
[248:57.83]I have an insane urge to slide tackle that guy.
[249:02.83]I think we gotta go up the stairs to get out.
[249:04.39]Well, we have four minutes.
[249:08.52]This place was definitely like a maze.
[249:15.84]This is not my favorite place we've ever been to.
[249:19.54]I know how to get out.
[249:20.40]Don't step on my mind.
[249:21.26]My favorite place I've ever been to is Wildwood, New Jersey.
[249:24.21]Where is it?
[249:24.73]Oh, it's right there.
[249:25.79]Okay.
[249:28.51]What the hell is this girl on the picture?
[249:32.95]Are you alive?
[249:33.79]Why can't we go in here?
[249:58.82]Oh, I see you.
[249:59.56]You OK, I see what you're doing.
[250:03.14]Alright, how do we get at this place?
[250:04.35]A fun house?
[250:05.15]How do we get out of here?
[250:25.61]Hello, anybody here?
[250:29.03]I don't know how to... There's a monster over there and I don't know where to go.
[250:39.72]How do I get out of here?
[250:43.64]Why do I feel like every single one of these buildings is a right turn, a right turn, a right turn, a right turn, a right turn, a right turn, and then a left turn to get out?
[251:09.66]There's no way I'm going to make it back now.
[251:11.22]Whoa, that's a red gas cloud and it's fucking crazy.
[251:22.75]I gotta get it.
[251:28.17]Oh my God.

[253:12.97]I wasn't expecting this game to run four and a half hours, but.
[253:17.03]It has run four and a half hours.
[253:21.33]I didn't think of the time.
[253:22.96]Sir, I didn't get a chance to play hammer watch.
[253:26.32]You can do it next week.
[253:28.26]That was the other game we're going to play, right?
[253:31.22]Yeah.
[253:33.00]Not quite at 5 stars yet.
[253:41.12]This isn't even 5 stars, this is 4.1.
[253:44.04]This is a... A restaurant that I would eat at, because anything over a 4.0 is fair game.
[253:55.57]I like watching the movies that have bad ratings.
[253:58.45]When a movie has mixed reviews, that's a good movie.
[254:01.99]A restaurant's bad ratings is you shitting, like, water, by the way.
[254:05.80]That's not the same as seeing a bad movie.
[254:09.72]Well, sometimes I don't check the ratings of a place before I go in.
[254:12.48]Well, Jerma, I can eat pork out of a backpack and I'm fine, so.
[254:17.91]Is there, well, I'm sorry, did you say pork out of a backpack?
[254:21.11]Yeah.
[254:21.93]Yeah, explain.
[254:23.09]What's the story there?
[254:24.65]Yeah, uh, come on.
[254:29.62]No, I just left pork in a backpack overnight and ate it the next day and I was fine.
[254:33.94]It was a whole thing.
[254:36.06]Guys, I can't move.
[254:37.50]I can't move.
[254:38.14]Wait, I can leave.
[255:04.00]I made it.
[255:06.14]Cool.
[255:15.44]That's the best.
[255:15.88]That's the best.
[255:16.62]Best one.
[255:16.84]Got the best picture I need to stay alive.
[255:19.32]That is the best picture I need to stay alive.
[255:22.98]That's what I wanted.
[255:23.70]That's the photo I wanted and it's the best one.
[255:35.34]I'm so dead.
[255:39.62]Where are you guys?
[255:42.84]Hey, if I die, make sure somebody gets my camera so you can see my picture.
[255:45.48]Are they even still in here?
[255:47.26]I have no idea.
[255:53.96]Oh, that's right.
[255:54.42]Leave now and just get back to the helicopter with my one picture.
[255:58.00]Good idea.
[256:05.12]god you've got to be kidding me I I cannot believe it I ca why is this why it's why why this game is so dark you can't they they just blend into the ground I'm bringing this back to the ship oh well
[256:49.22]Yeah, make sure.
[256:49.68]Hey, tell their chat.
[256:50.84]Go in their chats and say, hey, get his camera.
[256:52.52]Get his camera.
[256:53.04]It's right at the front door.
[256:54.32]You could also do the revive thing.
[257:06.53]I think you have to.
[257:07.89]Something very specific has to happen to you, I think, for that to happen, I think.
[257:19.92]I don't wanna.
[257:35.55]You cheated for 18 points.
[257:41.70]Oh, okay.
[257:42.08]Puck's going to get it.
[257:42.66]Front door.
[257:43.48]Okay.
[257:43.98]Okay.
[257:44.62]But if he gets... Tell him also to be careful of that sewer.
[257:48.99]Because he's going to walk out and the same exact thing is going to happen to him.
[257:51.15]Or don't tell him and laugh when he walks over it.
[258:06.38]I'm still taking my photo.
[258:08.78]Oh, he's trying to get a good picture.
[258:20.49]Okay, what's the over-under?
[258:21.59]Does he, does he do it?
[258:37.96]I, it's so scary out there.
[258:39.54]I get it.
[258:39.94]Well that fucking sucked.
[258:47.89]Oh no, he's gonna get killed.
[258:50.95]Man, I had such good photos.
[258:52.79]I had a really good one too.
[258:53.91]It's unfortunate.
[258:54.97]Dammit.
[259:06.53]Jerma's corpse is looking pretty amazing right now.
[259:17.80]Listen moves down.
[259:22.12]A Ster is still alive.
[259:28.12]Is my camera even still of all it is OK?
[259:32.34]The corpse just fell through the Earth while I was going to say I just saw that too.
[259:36.45]That did not look fun.
[259:41.40]It's trying to stomp poke right now.
[259:43.66]It's so loud.
[259:45.16]Oh my God.
[260:23.53]He'll survive that drop.
[260:25.05]That's survivable.
[260:27.39]Is it?
[260:27.81]What is happening to me?
[260:36.56]What is going on?
[260:41.15]He's like not in control of his own body.
[260:43.27]Yeah, like the collision gets a little weird.
[260:45.87]Yeah.
[260:48.89]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy.
[260:51.09]Get the cameras! Get the cameras! Get the cameras! Yes!
[260:54.13]Is he actually gonna do it?
[260:56.33]Is it just you?
[260:58.55]Oh no way.
[261:06.94]Woah! What the fuck? Did you just launch into the helicopter?
[261:13.74]That was actually one of the coolest things I've ever seen.
[261:19.94]That was insane.
[261:21.82]Holy shit, dude.
[261:22.60]That was awesome.
[261:23.42]Yes.
[261:27.90]Did you recover a camera or no?
[261:30.12]No.
[261:31.42]Sadly, no.
[261:33.04]Damn.
[261:33.64]That's nice.
[261:44.71]The Elon...
[261:48.47]God damn it.
[261:52.19]That's big.
[261:52.99]That was just a big thigh.
[261:54.93]That was just a big thigh.
[261:57.90]Here, hold on.
[261:58.62]I got my bonus picture.
[262:00.32]It's not on the list.
[262:03.98]My best one.
[262:04.82]My greatest work.
[262:06.04]What is your submission for the contest?
[262:08.56]This one.
[262:09.71]That's good.
[262:10.69]That's pretty good.
[262:11.23]Yeah, that's good.
[262:13.75]Oh, how'd you get that?
[262:16.83]What?
[262:20.15]Oh, the selfie.
[262:22.04]That's the thumbnail.
[262:22.92]Let me see.
[262:24.14]Oh, close to it.
[262:25.12]Yeah.
[262:27.26]You can download the pictures if you press that little button.
[262:32.28]Now everybody has a copy.
[262:35.35]Yeah.
[262:37.21]So what's everyone's choice as their best photo?
[262:42.97]Except for Sturridge.
[262:43.53]We saw Sturridge, right?
[262:45.07]That's just you.
[262:45.53]That's number two, but that's me, man.
[262:47.09]What the fuck?
[262:47.85]That's the one that I took.
[262:49.75]Is this my picture?
[262:51.05]Your camera's not here.
[262:52.12]I forgot.
[262:53.58]It looks like he has a headache.
[262:56.50]I had some really good pictures that round too.
[262:59.00]That's very unfortunate.
[263:01.88]Oh, well.
[263:03.35]It was fun.
[263:04.19]I think my brain is sufficiently dead.
[263:06.41]Yeah, I am fried.
[263:07.65]Yeah, I'm kind of cooked too.
[263:09.47]Yeah.
[263:10.31]Poke, you need to recover and you need to feel better.
[263:12.97]I just have a pole.
[263:15.72]It's nothing bad, just my voice.
[263:17.18]I feel great.
[263:17.62]Okay, well, also, Ster, you need to recover and feel better too.
[263:22.12]I mean, I get it.
[263:22.70]You told me to leave.
[263:23.76]Yeah, he's telling us to get out.
[263:25.28]He wants alone time.
[263:26.94]Yeah.
[263:28.01]Jerma, you need to feel better as well.
[263:29.91]If you are...
[263:31.50]You know, in any way.
[263:32.50]It's so weird, you gotta chill out for a bit.
[263:34.79]Yeah, just feel better, you know?
[263:37.39]I mean, at one point when I started jumping on the couch and jumping up and down and screaming, like, get him, get him, get him, take a picture, I got fucking weird.
[263:45.47]I'm just gonna say it.
[263:47.31]We're tired because we had a lot of fun.
[263:49.59]Okay?
[263:50.69]Right, we did have a lot of fun.
[263:52.13]I had a lot of fun.
[263:54.11]No, that was fun.
[263:55.41]It's always fun with you boys.
[263:58.95]I hope we can meet again.
[264:02.37]Yes, new game.
[264:03.37]On this old dusty road.
[264:06.23]Well, we'll keep zorting and looking for games to zort.
[264:09.82]And yeah, Monster Hunter we got coming up.
[264:12.86]And then also, if you want to do Hammer Watch, I'm down.
[264:15.98]Ster and whoever else.
[264:18.32]I'd be down on Monster Hunter as well.
[264:22.32]I'm down for anything you guys want to do.
[264:23.70]I'm down for Monster Hunter.
[264:25.38]Literally anything.
[264:26.97]Sign it.
[264:28.89]That could be fun.
[264:29.37]Alright.
[264:31.59]Lads, thank you so much.
[264:33.15]I'll see you later.
[264:34.09]Yeah.
[264:34.63]GG's guys.
[264:35.25]Have a great time.
[264:36.95]GG's.
[264:41.58]You have been disconnected.
[264:45.24]Okay, so that's that.
[264:46.64]That was the headliners.
[264:47.84]That was very fun.
[264:52.17]Uh, yeah.
[264:52.49]Headliners on Steam.
[264:56.92]I think there's a lot of avenue for them to potentially add some kind of drip feed content over the, uh, over the next period.
[265:08.17]It's a great, that is a great game to just jump in, get in a call with some friends and just fuck around, which is exactly what we did.
[265:14.11]So very good.
[265:16.61]Next time you'll see me.
[265:18.96]Yeah, I do have to finish Nancy Drew and the Infinity Nikki.
[265:25.52]Uh.
[265:26.90]Fit contest.
[265:30.72]Oh my God, there's nothing on the screen.
[265:37.06]There's nothing on the screen and I gotta get out of the game and we gotta put this on too.
[265:46.63]But yeah.
[265:49.34]It's been a while since I've played a game with folkster of any little group.
[266:00.09]Oh, also I want to talk about this too.
[266:02.79]The, uh, there's going to be another, so the archive channel has been doing restreams of old streams and they've apparently been pretty fun.
[266:16.10]There's going to be another one.
[266:19.37]Seems like the archive channel does once or twice a month.
[266:26.54]I actually have a link for you.
[266:27.80]Because the last time that it was done, it was the movies.
[266:37.19]Remember the old movie stream?
[266:39.91]They are doing the movies part two.
[266:43.54]if you and a lot of there's a lot of people that have never seen any of these streams it's a good way to kind of have a live chat while you do it oh let me link it what am I doing if I can well I can't see what I'm doing I can't see what I'm doing a lot of stuff blocking okay
[267:11.24]That link will take you to the waiting room.
[267:13.92]It's happening on February 7th.
[267:18.24]February 7th.
[267:27.98]What is the channel point situation?
[267:30.52]My voice is so fucked up.
[267:31.54]I was like laughing the whole time.
[267:33.36]I literally just watched a four and a half hour comedy where I laughed at every scene.
[267:37.76]My body hurts.
[267:40.31]Okay.
[267:42.30]Um, it's your birthday today.
[267:46.68]Well, happy, happy, happy birthday.
[267:51.06]Darn it.
[267:53.40]Uh, channel points.
[267:53.98]Okay.
[267:54.82]So, uh, I'm still figuring it out.
[267:56.97]There's a lot of, uh, stuff I have to do potentially.
[268:00.63]Uh, there's certain things I have to do to my stream to, let's say, call it be allowed to do it.
[268:10.07]And if it actually does come through and you actually do see it, you will know what I'm talking about when you see it.
[268:16.55]But it's hit a little bit of an impasse, I will say.
[268:20.97]I do still want to do it.
[268:23.35]But I got to figure out the right way to do it.
[268:31.01]And with that, I'll see you guys later.
[268:32.53]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[268:39.85]And I will talk to you all soon.
[268:41.75]What am I going to stream next?
[268:42.51]Let's see.
[268:48.37]Maybe next week at some point.
[268:51.31]Either this weekend or early next week is when you'll see another stream.
[268:55.27]Probably like a week.
[269:04.84]Should I raid somebody?
[269:05.40]Yeah, let's raid somebody.
[269:07.13]Who is screaming right now?
[269:12.66]It's currently live.
[269:22.85]Is Etalyx live?
[269:23.57]Etalyx is live, right?
[269:24.55]I think so.
[269:25.93]Etalyx is live.
[269:29.39]Etalyx is also playing Kingdom Come Deliverance 2.
[269:32.32]So... Uh...
[269:36.96]Let me know how it is, because I want to play this too at some point.
[269:40.36]Yeah, it's been a very long time since I've dumped you all over on Italic, so go say hello.
[269:47.32]Go ahead, do it.
[269:58.48]Alright guys, see you later.
[269:59.16]Take care.
[270:00.76]All your mother.
[270:02.39]Have a wonderful rest of your evening.
[270:05.15]Bye for now.
[270:34.85]you
