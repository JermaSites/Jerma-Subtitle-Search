[05:35.47]Buy back that.
[05:36.37]I think you're actually good with pistols.
[05:38.55]Each class is good with two things.
[05:40.05]One's, like, a main, one's a secondary.
[05:42.11]I'm just not sure which one it is.
[05:43.15]There's a guy on the ground.
[05:44.19]Here, we have to take his book.
[05:45.23]Did you take his book already?
[05:46.69]I did.
[05:47.37]We have to find his, like, cigar stuff, or whatever it is.
[05:51.99]God forbid he stops smoking.
[05:53.89]Yeah, I know.
[05:58.05]Nice little radio there.
[06:00.61]Oh, this thing has reload time of five years.
[06:04.09]Holy shit.
[06:06.29]You coming?
[06:07.69]Yeah, we gotta make it so this is the one we're doing.
[06:10.49]Collect Bruce's box of cigars near Titan's End.
[06:12.70]Because right now it's on leaving Firestone.
[06:15.80]How far is Titan's End?
[06:18.06]Uh, I can't... Can you do it?
[06:19.42]Can you make the... Yeah, sure.
[06:21.64]I got it.
[06:26.09]uh... right now it's not like Bruce's boxes cigars okay let's see on the map where that is it's not too far it's just around that corner I know where to get it how to get to it coming yep let me see if there's anything over here that we can get there's a sniper on the ground it's only worth 271 whatever yeah no forget it
[06:57.67]20 bucks.
[06:58.53]That was worth it.
[07:01.42]20 bucks.
[07:04.38]Don't worry, I'm not trying to kill you.
[07:05.70]No worries.
[07:09.54]Alright.
[07:10.00]All you got to do is go up here and to the left.
[07:12.54]Just keep standing on the left.
[07:14.29]And that will prove difficult?
[07:18.77]You got to turn around.
[07:20.01]You want to go... There, yeah.
[07:23.69]Now you just hug this wall.
[07:25.15]We'll get there.
[07:29.72]here we are it's right in here is to Chester money no doctors and what do you have for me 202 damn you know we can't get the car through here yeah at least we have a checkpoint right there
[07:59.19]Yep.
[07:59.39]Just gonna slip through.
[08:03.09]Find these cigars.
[08:04.09]We have enemies ahead of us.
[08:07.23]Um, actually, is that the right way?
[08:11.27]Looks like there's a... Can you go... Can we go up here?
[08:14.07]Yeah, I think it's up here.
[08:15.94]It's, like, along this wall somewhere.
[08:20.48]Oh, cool, man.
[08:21.40]Nice.
[08:21.70]Yeah, I think this is it right here.
[08:26.42]Ooh, weapons chest.
[08:29.21]Yep, this box right there.
[08:32.14]Please be a static SMG or something.
[08:34.76]Fire, fire, no.
[08:35.72]It's just one pistol?
[08:37.02]That's kind of odd.
[08:38.64]Oh, we got guys down there.
[08:41.25]Only one of them has shields, though.
[08:43.71]Time to test out my shields.
[08:45.97]Shall I?
[08:46.39]I'm throwing a grenade down there.
[08:51.22]Oh, we got skags too.
[08:52.36]Oh wait, the skags are fighting me.
[08:56.18]Back up.
[08:56.66]I just threw one of those cluster grenades.
[08:59.32]I don't think those can hurt me.
[09:01.80]Oh, okay.
[09:02.34]That's good.
[09:09.36]Go, my bird.
[09:10.02]Conserved ammo.
[09:15.41]Here, shields are down on me.
[09:17.91]I gotta come down.
[09:18.75]Too far away.
[09:30.94]Alright.
[09:32.02]Looking for more cigars.
[09:34.24]Health file right there.
[09:36.49]I'll take that.
[09:37.25]Alright, there's the one.
[09:39.27]Should be one more box.
[09:40.43]Alright, that's it.
[09:42.19]We're done?
[09:43.09]That's it for this one, yep.
[09:45.75]Not bad, that was a quick quest.
[09:47.09]That was easy.
[09:47.76]Yeah, this thing takes forever to reload.
[09:57.50]Whatever, it lowers their shield a lot faster.
[09:59.48]Yeah, I'm kind of... I wish I, uh... There's a skill point that I have that makes reloading weapons a ton faster, and I just didn't go down that tree.
[10:09.97]I think I should have, but you know what?
[10:11.39]It's alright.
[10:12.07]I went down, like, the sniping tree.
[10:14.43]That was good.
[10:20.12]Alright, so, just go straight.
[10:24.46]Straight through there.
[10:26.38]and then they don't left kinda and stay straight bag another left once you've been left to stay straight it's not so straight they're right and it's just like the whole and this is the last for you will boost boosted
[10:55.41]We made it.
[11:06.45]And what did we get?
[11:08.14]Bruce is dead, that idiot.
[11:10.36]Alright.
[11:12.68]So.
