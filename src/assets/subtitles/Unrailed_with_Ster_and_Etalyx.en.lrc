[00:01.94]Alright, hello.
[00:04.80]Did we lose Star?
[00:05.60]Star's gone.
[00:14.59]He's just, he left.
[00:19.65]Oh no, he's not, he's here.
[00:21.53]So for 12 months, way back when, when you were allowed to do that as a channel.
[00:25.51]Are you, are you sticking around?
[00:27.85]Yeah, I got guilted by my mom.
[00:31.30]My mom said, don't stop playing video games right now.
[00:34.85]Keep playing games.
[00:36.49]And now I have to keep playing games because my mom told me to.
[00:41.61]You know what?
[00:42.23]It's such a... I feel like that could be true.
[00:46.18]It is.
[00:46.78]It is 100% true.
[00:51.06]My mom and my wife teamed up to guilt me into playing a game.
[00:56.70]Because she's just like you.
[00:57.78]One of her favorite games is House Flipper.
[00:59.90]She's put a ton of hours into it.
[01:02.28]She loves watching the Jerma House Flipper streams.
[01:05.14]If you ask her what her favorite stream or video is of her son, she'll say Jerma's House Flipper.
[01:15.90]What incredible taste.
[01:17.48]I just have to say, seriously.
[01:19.32]And then she says, you're welcome, chat, but it's you're, not apostrophe, you are.

[02:16.07]Um... What?
[02:25.96]Is this like a joke?
[02:29.66]No, no, no.
[02:30.20]Like, the open... Okay, the opening page.
[02:33.97]I don't even want to show this.
[02:39.67]No, it's like a person's phone number.
[02:47.77]Thank you for playing our early access.
[02:49.35]By the way, if you want to, like, call this person that's like the CEO of the... Wow, that...
[02:56.06]I don't, I, I, this might be fake?
[02:58.04]Is this part of the game?
[03:03.29]No, no, fuck that.
[03:04.81]Alright.

[03:20.84]Alright, I'm gonna go start game.
[03:25.05]How do we play this together?
[03:26.11]Anybody?
[03:26.49]Do we have any idea?
[03:32.88]Well, hold on.
[03:33.44]I think you have to do the tutorial.
[03:41.43]You'll be alright.
[03:48.19]You're gonna be fine.
[03:50.73]See?
[03:50.93]Do you believe that?
[03:56.37]Well, then that contradicts what you just said.
[03:59.65]Okay, so... I don't know if it's a... No, dude, I'm serious.
[04:08.09]It shows, like, a guy's phone number.
[04:13.19]Oh, man.
[04:14.28]Guys.
[04:16.84]Hold on.
[04:17.12]You guys have been muted this whole time.
[04:18.62]I'm so sorry.
[04:19.28]He's... Alright.
[04:21.68]That's okay.
[04:22.14]I wasn't even talking.
[04:24.16]He's been muted.
[04:24.86]I muted you for most of that time.
[04:26.38]Okay.
[04:27.66]Fuck.
[04:28.24]He was muted the whole time.
[04:29.46]God damn it.
[04:30.56]Okay, I'm gonna call this guy and I'm gonna ask how we play together.
[04:33.34]Don't do that!
[04:36.50]Hey, do we have to play the tutorial first?
[04:39.44]Yes, just do it!
[04:42.22]No, I'm gonna ask him.
[04:44.42]Oh my fucking god.
[04:45.82]Alright, I'm just gonna play the game and we'll queue up in a minute.
[04:51.40]To craft new track pieces, you need wood and iron.
[04:53.14]What?
[04:54.22]What region is plus 49?
[04:57.00]Stop!
[04:57.36]Stop it!
[04:59.36]Dude, anyone who wants this can just buy the game.
[05:02.42]Oh, it's Germany.
[05:11.86]Alright, you have to chop down wood?
[05:19.55]What time is it in Germany?
[05:20.89]It's late.
[05:24.14]I think we're, yeah, we're doing the tutorial.
[05:28.36]It's too late, I'm not calling him.
[05:32.88]It's gonna go to his answering.
[05:34.12]Yeah, it's probably like 5.30 there, he's probably asleep.
[05:36.42]No, it's 2am they're saying.
[05:38.98]I'll tell you, you gotta have some, like, iron, iron body to put your personal telephone number at the splash screen of your video game.
[05:51.58]It probably goes to like a Hulk Hogan fake answering machine.
[05:54.23]It probably does.
[05:59.47]Okay, so what am I doing?
[06:01.21]Do I do start game?
[06:02.29]How do we play?
[06:04.23]I gotta call this guy.
[06:05.66]Just do the tutorial.
[06:07.62]Is that when you click start game?
[06:08.86]Yeah, it just goes.
[06:10.38]Yes.
[06:11.64]Okay.
[06:12.36]Alright, so you put both.
[06:13.80]Hold on.
[06:21.88]And then... Holy shit, this is gonna be insanely difficult.
[06:27.93]Is it?
[06:28.77]I think so.
[06:31.23]Okay, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:33.45]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:34.69]Is this on, um... Twitch yet?
[06:38.00]What's it called?
[06:38.72]Unrailed?
[06:40.00]Unrailed.
[06:42.36]Okay.
[06:42.84]It is.
[06:43.10]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:47.00]What are we holding up for?
[06:47.76]Can you do me a favor?
[06:51.60]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[06:52.58]I don't know how to bring that screen back up again.
[07:02.13]It doesn't do it if you reopen the game.
[07:03.67]Alright, I want to be the first one to finish the tutorial so I can say how smart I am.
[07:07.35]I don't think he is.
[07:10.15]His phone number is lost to me.
[07:13.69]It really doesn't show it again if you don't... I don't know how to bring it back up.
[07:22.15]What do we want?
[07:24.09]The train overheats over time and will start to burn.
[07:26.71]Build a bridge to the bucket and fill it with the river.
[07:35.40]Nobody tell him.
[07:36.74]How the hell are we gonna do this together?
[07:38.18]We've got, like, Sleepy Star on the call.
[07:42.52]You think he's gonna wanna do this?
[07:44.50]How do I do a plus on the phone?
[07:48.81]It says zero is a plus.
[07:50.81]Done it.
[07:51.67]Tutorial's done.
[07:52.71]I win.
[07:53.03]I'm the smartest gamer.
[07:56.35]I didn't even know it was a competition until you said it.
[07:58.21]You could have been speedrunning it.
[08:08.84]Okay.
[08:10.88]There we go.
[08:11.60]Online game.
[08:12.82]Yeah.
[08:13.32]Alright, do we know how this... Is this through Steam or what?
[08:18.36]That is a good question.
[08:21.34]Create private lobby.
[08:23.86]Might want to hide your... What the hell are you doing?
[08:28.09]I fucked up.
[08:33.57]That's the way he wrote it, but then it says that's not how you do it.
[08:38.65]You can't call from the United States.
[08:42.63]You can.
[08:43.51]No, you can't.
[08:44.63]Best case scenario, best case scenario, he answers.
[08:48.46]He goes, hi, how are you?
[08:49.56]And you go, hi, I'm streaming your game right now.
[08:52.22]He tunes in, then you insult him and say his game sucks.
[08:56.43]And you personally call him to, like, make fun of him.
[09:00.05]You have to do, like, star something something.
[09:02.77]You can't just call the number.
[09:03.79]Well, no, no, no.
[09:04.29]See, because it's plus 49 for Germany, and then it has parentheses zero.
[09:08.62]You've got to do something before that.
[09:09.64]What it just said is not to do the parentheses zero, but that's the way he wrote it.
[09:15.74]Plus, that call is going to cost you, like, $60 a minute.
[09:23.44]Guys, I can't.
[09:24.46]I'm making Jerma very uncomfortable.
[09:30.80]The guy just wanted to have a conversation about his game with other people.
[09:34.96]And Jerma said, you know what?
[09:36.87]I have a session.
[09:37.89]Are you done with the tutorial?
[09:40.83]I see.
[09:41.13]And it's people like you is why we're never going to find Hillary's emails.
[09:45.93]What do I do in this tutorial?
[09:47.05]Well, I could try moving your character.
[09:48.57]Oh, you motherfucker.
[09:51.23]I was calling him!
[09:52.93]I was busy!
[09:53.49]You were trying to call a person that you don't know's random telephone number for a laugh-out-loud, fucking, look what I'm doing on the stream, I'm gonna call this guy!
[10:02.54]And you haven't even moved your character on the screen?
[10:04.92]I didn't even- I just got in the game.
[10:09.00]Oh my god.
[10:09.74]Alright, well- How do I join you?
[10:12.00]You have to give me your session ID.
[10:13.80]I have a session ID.
[10:14.82]I have a session ID.
[10:16.85]I'm about to give it to you.
[10:17.69]I'm gonna put it into the chat.
[10:23.51]Star, don't leak this.
[10:30.59]That's the session ID.
[10:33.51]He wants people to call him, though.
[10:35.59]It's different.
[10:39.68]Yeah, if there's like a bug or something, you're just gonna... What's the purpose of your call?
[10:45.48]I was gonna ask if we had to do the tutorial before we play together.
[10:48.60]You're our speakerphone on my stream.
[10:52.75]Okay.
[10:53.89]What do you want?
[10:56.47]Just hang up.
[10:58.67]Do you honestly think that's the worst call he would have ever gotten?
[11:01.97]No.
[11:02.85]Excuse me, sir.
[11:03.67]I'm showing interest in your indie game.
[11:05.48]I know you worked really hard on it, but I'd rather not talk to you and not share it with anyone.
[11:09.78]Bye.
[11:11.70]Alex, you have 466 ping right now.
[11:12.60]Why?
[11:21.11]Grab some wood?
[11:21.89]Where's the wood?
[11:25.33]The wood?
[11:25.95]If you chop down... Have you ever played a video game that's come out in the last 10 years?
[11:30.04]You have to get wood from the tree.
[11:34.78]Is there action we're not seeing?
[11:35.78]Yeah, there is, but the session ID is on the screen, so I can't show it.
[11:40.62]I don't know how to do this.
[11:42.10]This game's hard.
[11:49.18]Uh...
[11:50.12]How do you make the rail?
[11:56.33]Oh wait, did Etalyx show the session ID?
[11:59.89]What did that tutorial message just say?
[12:04.09]I'm out.
[12:05.81]I almost got it.
[12:08.11]I left the call.
[12:09.43]Not the call, I left the lobby.
[12:11.23]You didn't... What?
[12:12.45]Okay, Star, you have to host this lobby because we're on like... You have to host this.
[12:17.00]My train's on fire.
[12:18.34]Yes, go get the bucket, stand next to the water, let it fill, and then walk over to the left and pour it.
[12:25.14]Oh.
[12:26.96]Okay, yeah, okay.
[12:29.14]Remember when you wanted me to play and my mom wanted me to play?
[12:32.09]I'm changing diapers here.
[12:35.17]Isn't that weird?
[12:40.70]Oops.
[12:42.12]Was I muted?
[12:43.34]You leaked us.
[12:45.14]I know, but it doesn't matter because he's not even done with the tutorial anyway.
[12:48.74]Make sure you put your region to U.S.
[12:50.95]West, by the way.
[12:52.93]I have to do that?
[12:55.55]Yeah.
[12:56.11]Go to online.
[12:56.51]And then go to region U.S.
[12:57.87]West and select it.
[13:08.50]What if I did Korea?
[13:10.86]Then it would be very bad because you would be relaying through entire continents.
[13:15.28]Okay, how do I join you?
[13:16.42]Or do I need to call the guy?
[13:17.94]You're going to hit a BRB screen or black out your screen.
[13:22.44]You're going to go to create private lobby.
[13:26.34]Okay.
[13:26.60]There's going to be a seed in the top left.
[13:29.12]Don't tell anybody else that seed.
[13:30.97]That's just for me to tell.
[13:32.99]Wouldn't it be cool if like a hundred people joined though?
[13:36.62]This game can only have like five, I think there's only four people.
[13:39.92]Alright, and then you're gonna just type into the chat what, make sure you're US West in your region, and you're gonna type into the Discord chat with the three of us in here, that five digit seed, session ID.
[13:56.47]Hold on, my game like froze.
[14:03.77]on session id and it's got a little cursor and you have to press escape I'm focusing okay and now I do I start the game or do I give this to you first just wait to don't hit start yet just give this thick it is definitely not poopoo it's definitely not that that's not that is what it is because I know it's not special it is
[14:39.28]Hang on.
[14:40.80]Are we sure?
[14:41.36]I don't know.
[14:42.74]I don't... I don't know if that's real.
[14:44.44]I actually had to look on Steam to check to see if he even installed the game.
[14:48.16]I wondered if this was just a bruise.
[14:52.15]But, yeah.
[14:52.79]He is in fact in the game on Steam.
[14:54.93]He's in his poo poo lobby.
[14:56.69]Okay.
[14:57.31]Let's go.
[14:57.71]Is that how that works?
[15:01.25]I'm going to join your lobby.
[15:03.21]Session ID.
[15:03.73]Oh, wait.
[15:03.97]No.
[15:04.11]You want session ID?
[15:05.01]Yes.
[15:05.69]Yes.
[15:06.01]Oh.
[15:09.75]You just made a custom seed.
[15:11.32]Okay, cool.
[15:12.80]I thought I was smart.
[15:14.72]No, make sure you're not showing this to anybody.
[15:17.22]I'm not.
[15:17.86]I'm not.
[15:18.36]Why would I do that?
[15:21.71]Okay, I'm connecting.
[15:22.91]I can't get off the typing.
[15:26.49]Okay, there we go.
[15:28.08]Now, game mode.
[15:30.28]Difficulty.
[15:33.38]Enable checkpoints.
[15:33.94]Who would leak such a thing?
[15:36.24]Do not allow random players to join.
[15:38.19]Are we good?
[15:39.97]Difficulty?
[15:40.35]Don't put it on medium.
[15:41.03]Don't put it on hard.
[15:42.07]There's no way we're going to do that.
[15:44.95]And game mode endless.
[15:46.49]Why would we not do game mode normal?
[15:51.08]Well, isn't endless the normal?
[15:52.66]I guess it is normal.
[15:53.50]Alright.
[15:55.24]Endless is like, see how far you can get before you crash.
[15:58.50]Alright.
[15:58.84]You ready?
[15:59.98]Let's go.
[16:01.00]With checkpoints enabled, you can restart at the first station in each biome after you crash.
[16:05.35]Alright.
[16:05.71]Are we ready to start streaming this game?
[16:07.05]Do not show up on the leaderboard.
[16:08.73]Hurry up.
[16:09.23]I showed it.
[16:09.83]So everyone come stand up here.
[16:11.23]You have to all stand here, I think.
[16:12.79]I showed it.
[16:13.37]I definitely showed it.
[16:15.90]You showed it?
[16:16.52]Let's go.
[16:17.40]It was an accident.
[16:18.10]I thought we were starting.
[16:20.12]He showed it.
[16:23.22]Okay, if you guys actually have this game, call that number.
[16:25.52]Tell me what happened.
[16:26.82]Okay, let's go.
[16:27.26]Alright, we got to kill the creepers.
[16:30.32]The endermen.
[16:31.06]We got to build a train track and we got to dig a path for it straight ahead.
[16:35.22]So, go directly in front.
[16:36.91]The train is already moving.
[16:38.53]Yeah, it's moving.
[16:39.91]Alright, we're making train track.
[16:41.31]Yeah, this is endless.
[16:53.68]What's this bucket?
[16:54.42]The bucket?
[16:57.44]You did the tutorial.
[16:58.92]I know, but what's the... I know it's the water, water, water, water, water, water.
[17:04.22]How do we make it like another mine?
[17:06.78]We need track.
[17:08.80]We need wood.
[17:09.64]But there's no woodies.
[17:10.56]Wait, wait, wait, I gotta go up.
[17:11.54]You gotta dig up.
[17:14.12]Who is this person?
[17:14.62]The person's hitting me.
[17:15.84]We're dead.
[17:16.91]We're dead.
[17:17.33]It's over.
[17:18.29]Alright, get out, get out.
[17:19.69]What's it called?
[17:20.19]Where is it?
[17:25.57]I can't move.
[17:26.29]Somebody has to break me out.
[17:30.72]We need that pickaxe so we can actually... You guys can't get over here.
[17:36.75]You just made a turn.
[17:37.63]No, no, no, no, no.
[17:51.67]How do we get water?
[17:52.37]Water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water, water.
[17:54.76]We got to get a crossing.
[17:59.04]I'm killing the creepers.
[18:06.10]OK, good.
[18:10.33]Where's the picket?
[18:10.91]Where's the axe?
[18:12.15]I got it.
[18:13.83]Wood.
[18:14.21]Put wood in the thing.
[18:15.19]Wood.
[18:15.93]Put wood in it.
[18:17.41]There's no wood.
[18:18.47]I'm chopping the trees.
[18:19.63]Come get the wood.
[18:23.30]Alright, I need one piece of wood to build a bridge.
[18:30.18]Run it out of space.
[18:31.00]No, no, no, no, no.
[18:32.06]Turn it this way.
[18:34.03]What is that?
[18:34.63]Keep going.
[18:35.79]Why is this a mini?
[18:37.49]How do I?
[18:37.97]No, this way, right here.
[18:41.07]This is just grass.
[18:42.19]Okay, so we can go over that.
[18:45.47]Should we go right?
[18:46.09]Go straight.
[18:47.01]No, go straight.
[18:47.55]I cleared a path already that goes all the way up here.
[18:51.31]Oh, okay.
[18:51.59]Where's the axe?
[18:53.13]I got it.
[18:53.52]We need more wood.
[18:58.28]Alright, wood's behind me.
[18:59.36]Fire, fire.
[19:00.56]It's about right.
[19:01.54]It's over.
[19:02.12]It's gonna crash, it's gonna crash, it's gonna crash, crash, crash, crash, crash, crash.
[19:08.53]Just get the tracks.
[19:11.69]Uh-oh.
[19:12.43]We can turn it.
[19:14.75]No, you can't turn it.
[19:16.07]What do you mean you can turn it?
[19:18.91]Is this snake advanced?
[19:22.01]Where's the axe?
[19:22.95]Oh, my God.
[19:23.65]Turn it again.
[19:24.20]Hang on.
[19:28.08]We're just buying time.
[19:29.92]We need more wood.
[19:31.88]I'm chopping it down right now.
[19:44.28]So, you guys... Oh my god.
[19:48.47]I'm just gonna chop down every tree over here.
[19:52.45]Too many cooks in the kitchen.
[19:53.99]Just keep chopping.
[19:55.09]We're just gonna go in a straight line.
[19:57.09]Yeah, but we need wood and shit.
[19:58.27]I'm just gonna be the wood guy.
[20:00.08]You just chop a straight path all the way through and we'll be fine.
[20:02.50]Yeah, but wood.
[20:06.58]What about it?
[20:07.20]It's on fire.
[20:10.98]Where's the bucket?
[20:13.33]I'm already splashing.
[20:15.09]Okay.
[20:15.55]How are we doing?
[20:16.17]Good?
[20:16.79]Right.
[20:17.09]We need just regular old track.
[20:20.93]Tons of stone needed.
[20:21.99]We need stone.
[20:22.69]Alright.
[20:26.86]That was good.
[20:28.40]What can I chop?
[20:30.32]Over here at the right.
[20:33.56]I'm going to throw up.
[20:34.52]Alright.
[20:37.44]Things have kind of calmed down a little.
[20:39.02]Yeah.
[20:39.26]That was good.
[20:39.62]That was a little panicky for a minute, but it's alright.
[20:54.07]Tons of resources.
[20:55.49]Yeah, we have a lot of resources.
[20:57.15]Build resources!
[20:58.93]Remember back in the day?
[21:00.61]Yeah.
[21:06.38]Is your track ready?
[21:08.26]Oh my god.
[21:09.92]You see, it's hard to place them.
[21:12.52]Actually, that's not a bad idea.
[21:14.40]It'll take a long time to get over here.
[21:18.27]Alright, I'm gonna chop down some... I'm gonna get some more stone.
[21:23.23]I think we're gonna go straight down this way.
[21:28.85]Why not go, you gotta go to the station.
[21:30.71]That's what I'm doing.
[21:31.21]Oh.
[21:32.41]Well, why not go through the trees and then we get a bunch of, uh, wood.
[21:36.63]We got, uh... Look at all the wood that's already around all over the place.
[21:39.00]We got a fire.
[21:40.12]There's tons of wood.
[21:40.74]How about we, how about we speed this thing up?
[21:43.26]It probably will when you hit the checkpoint.
[21:44.56]Alright, we got plenty of resources.
[21:49.22]Where's the, uh, axe?
[21:50.08]Good, good, good.
[22:02.04]Turn your volume down.
[22:03.42]Alright, quick.
[22:04.90]You gotta get in front of it.
[22:06.30]What am I doing?
[22:07.46]Alright, you're good.
[22:09.48]You're good.
[22:10.40]It's about to go on the, um... On the... Straight away.
[22:16.85]Yeah, we can build bridges, dude.
[22:19.21]We need more stone.
[22:20.35]We need stone, stone.
[22:21.45]A lot of wood, no stone.
[22:25.47]There's stone on the ground here.
[22:27.65]Fucking cry baby.
[22:28.65]It's raining.
[22:38.35]I'm cowboy.
[22:40.77]You're in the amateurs.
[22:41.73]Skull man.
[22:43.04]That's a top grade.
[22:43.70]I don't know what I am.
[22:44.94]Stone?
[22:45.38]Who are you?
[22:45.96]Stone man?
[22:47.28]Skull man?
[22:48.00]I think I'm like a skeleton in a suit or something.
[22:52.48]Just call me Sans.
[22:53.54]Remember that game?
[22:56.63]You didn't even play that game.
[22:59.51]I did not.
[23:00.67]I did not.
[23:01.15]Can I pause it?
[23:02.39]What if I show the session ID?
[23:09.13]Dude, what?
[23:11.91]Dude, what?
[23:16.51]Well, there's tons of it down here.
[23:19.05]It's going, it's going.
[23:25.72]Gonna need some stone, though.
[23:29.56]I'm on it.
[23:31.47]So are we.
[23:36.14]It's too dark.
[23:36.72]I can't see anything.
[23:38.08]I'm honestly scared.
[23:39.71]Wait, how did I ruin it?
[23:43.89]What?
[23:44.52]We're going to need that bucket.
[23:45.70]Yeah, we're going to do it.
[23:57.70]This is just the first station.
[24:00.06]That means we beat level one.
[24:01.34]Got it.
[24:01.88]Oh, no.
[24:02.48]Oh, no.
[24:02.84]Why is it going so fast?
[24:03.56]What's fucking happening?
[24:04.46]Because they've got the one for the station.
[24:07.52]Oh.
[24:07.68]Fucking money.
[24:09.98]You can spend your bolts for wagon upgrades.
[24:12.68]Oh, what?
[24:13.26]New wagons.
[24:16.08]So we got two bolts.
[24:17.47]What do they do?
[24:18.65]New engines to unlock.
[24:20.27]Crafting speed.
[24:21.27]So it makes track fast.
[24:24.31]More.
[24:24.87]Is this a water tank?
[24:28.20]Or more supplies can go in there to be crafted.
[24:33.10]I think it's going to be difficult to deal with the speed.
[24:36.68]We need more, like, stacks in the storage thing.
[24:39.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[24:41.52]Let's do that.
[24:42.68]But then we got a new wagon.
[24:44.44]Lights up in the dark.
[24:47.27]What's this one?
[24:48.87]Crafting space of 60%.
[24:51.13]Converts wood to iron or iron to wood.
[24:55.28]steam engine for the wild west how do we go where's our money is it one more bolt yeah we only have one bolt let's get capacity on this thing alright we're good we're good we're good that's 60 faster and back to lobby exits stand here um which one of these is correct I think exit stand here exit stand here dude
[25:27.24]Chat's mad that we didn't get a ghost.
[25:31.11]I don't know what it meant.
[25:34.11]We don't have time to sit around and dilly-dally.
[25:39.43]We surely do not.
[25:41.24]How come I can't pickaxe?
[25:45.84]we didn't get a ghost is some stone not it's only the the yeah you can't you can't do the black gray stone I got this song absolutely just is slaps yeah I was trying to think of that word and I'm not I'm too old to know what it was it's okay we know who the real boomer is

[26:21.97]You can't just see hanging out, hanging out with some of your friends.
[26:24.15]Just build a train track.
[26:25.73]You could definitely see it.
[26:27.77]No, I put the wood in.
[26:29.69]We need, we need stone.
[26:31.71]Where is it?
[26:32.50]I've been hitting it.
[26:33.10]Uh, you guys just want to make like a super big path?
[26:39.92]Don't leave all the tools back here.
[26:42.40]Across the wa- uh oh, we're on fire.

[26:53.92]Okay, we, yeah, we just go through the stone.
[26:56.53]Yeah, yeah, start, start stoning.
[26:58.11]We need stoning.
[26:59.25]I'm going.
[26:59.55]Start stoning.
[27:00.75]Start it!
[27:01.59]I'm going.
[27:02.05]We actually, we need, uh, we need wood to go.
[27:06.33]You alright?
[27:07.05]Uh, we need to go, we need wood to go across this path here.
[27:13.50]Gentlemen, we need wood.
[27:16.84]Otherwise, this thing ain't going anywhere.
[27:17.98]I'm wooding.
[27:24.02]No.
[27:26.50]Who's got the pick?
[27:28.21]It's in front of you.
[27:29.63]We're stuck on the wrong side.
[27:31.53]You got it.
[27:31.91]There we are.
[27:37.11]Hey, what?
[27:37.91]Can you say that again?
[27:40.13]What?
[27:41.57]No, say that again.
[27:44.20]Don't make me do it.
[27:45.04]I will.
[27:49.20]Okay, can you guys do something?
[27:50.58]We can't move.
[27:51.12]I can't.
[27:51.98]Literally can't.
[27:55.50]Oh, no.
[27:56.48]Can you literally do something?
[27:57.86]No, we can't do anything.
[27:58.88]You have to build.
[27:59.34]No, we're stuck on the bridge.
[28:00.40]No, we lose.
[28:01.02]You have to do the whole thing.
[28:02.32]Yeah, you have to do it all.
[28:03.74]We're about to lose.
[28:06.72]Oh, my God.
[28:07.28]He's just still chopping.
[28:10.10]He can't hear us.
[28:11.26]Well, you kept picking up the fucking thing.
[28:15.85]I tried to come back there and get things.
[28:17.85]You picked them.
[28:20.23]Look how easy that was.
[28:20.95]We need a shitload of wood.
[28:22.55]I'm going to fucking scream.
[28:24.21]We need a shitload of wood now.
[28:27.79]Look in front of us.
[28:36.29]Where are you going?
[28:37.45]I'm just getting wood.
[28:39.31]You have a clear path to the next, like, area.
[28:41.57]Fire!
[28:44.27]Where's the... I got it.
[28:49.22]We need a pickaxe.
[28:54.02]Dude, Star, how could you not have made a rubber ducky joke here?
[28:58.74]Come on, isn't that your thing?
[28:59.92]We need to have a track build.
[29:03.80]Are these cows gonna get in the way?
[29:06.74]Killed him.
[29:07.16]Wait, why are you going that way?
[29:10.10]Because that's the station.
[29:14.08]Killed him.
[29:17.20]We need stone bat.
[29:23.79]Alright, I got you on stone.
[29:28.13]This is too stressful.
[29:29.15]This is actually less stressful than the last game so far.
[29:33.71]We, um...
[29:43.14]Alright.
[29:43.82]Excuse me.
[29:46.58]We can go up.
[29:47.94]If you wanted to go up, that'd be good.
[29:49.84]No, go straight across.
[29:51.64]Well, we've got to go up eventually because that's where the station is.
[29:55.62]Yeah, but we can just go up one here.
[29:56.62]And it's all cleared.
[30:00.76]Yeah, but we can just go straight across.
[30:04.68]Like this, right?
[30:09.14]Now we would.
[30:10.26]Where's the axe?
[30:12.30]I'm killing the cows with it.
[30:14.96]That's great use of our materials.
[30:16.26]We desperately need wood.
[30:17.02]Good use of the materials.
[30:19.58]You murdering animals.
[30:20.88]Good.
[30:21.96]I want to make sure our train doesn't hit a fucking cow.
[30:27.39]Oh, there's gold down there at the bottom.
[30:28.91]You see that shit?
[30:30.09]There actually is.
[30:30.79]What is that?
[30:31.59]Wow.
[30:31.95]Turn it around.
[30:32.85]Turn it around.
[30:33.53]Turn it around.
[30:33.93]Turn it around.
[30:35.82]Turn this around.
[30:37.14]I think, do we just need to pick it up or does the train need to pass?
[30:39.74]The train has to hit it, for sure.
[30:41.44]How do you know?
[30:42.00]How do you know?
[30:44.08]That has to be what this is.
[30:44.92]How about we try the easier thing first?
[30:46.58]Alright, um, chop.
[30:59.72]We gotta get the upgrade, Matt.
[31:00.86]How are we going to?
[31:01.78]Oh my god, you just turned it.
[31:03.28]No, no, no, don't do that.
[31:04.40]You're doing it right.
[31:05.88]No, no, no, because it has to cross.
[31:07.22]How are we going to put it back the right way?
[31:08.68]Because we can just pick up the old track.
[31:10.42]Yeah, we can pick up the old track.
[31:19.69]Yep.
[31:20.25]Wow, you can make some big stacks.
[31:22.17]Fire.
[31:24.07]Fire.
[31:24.63]Fire.
[31:25.05]Oh shit, I got it, I got it.
[31:31.07]Alright, I need regular old wood.
[31:33.91]Regular wood.
[31:34.29]There's a ton of wood here.
[31:36.11]Make a path.
[31:39.60]You got to hurry or else it's going to cut us off.
[31:41.16]You got to do it from the other way.
[31:51.68]right now we need wood inside the train okay okay I picked it up the train doesn't need to touch it okay wait you got it you guys see I got it okay wait wait hold on hold on I told you stop stop stop stop stop now we um we can't pick up the track oh we can't pick up the track no what happens if you loop it in on itself but what in between
[32:21.17]No, put one on the other side.
[32:22.85]I hope you can't.
[32:31.55]Yeah, you can't pick it up after it goes over the track.
[32:33.45]We're going up.
[32:34.45]No!
[32:37.12]Can we go to the bottom?
[32:38.08]Can we get through?
[32:38.96]Hold on.
[32:44.02]We can't get through this.
[32:44.76]No, you fucked us.
[32:46.67]Well, it seemed reasonable that the train would have to pass over it.
[32:49.95]No!
[32:50.19]Just check first, because you have to build the bridge no matter what.
[32:53.31]And we had, like, seven stacks of wood.
[32:56.09]I'm not giving up yet.
[32:57.15]I'm not giving up yet.
[32:58.71]I'm not giving up yet.
[32:59.70]Don't give up yet.
[33:00.58]Hold on.
[33:01.44]What do you mean, don't give up yet?
[33:03.82]Oops.
[33:04.58]Okay.
[33:04.72]Okay, you're going to yell at me.
[33:05.66]I'm the one who fucking noticed it in the first place.
[33:07.60]You fucking...
[33:09.19]Alright, try again.
[33:34.36]Alright.
[33:34.68]Do we have to hide everything?
[33:35.63]I don't think so.
[33:36.73]This is a trap.
[33:38.37]Why'd you leave?
[33:39.07]I fucked up, dude.
[33:40.39]I fucked up.
[33:41.25]Have you ever fucked up before?
[33:42.51]No.
[33:47.19]Why would you leave?
[33:48.10]No.
[33:52.56]Alright.
[33:53.50]Just hide everything again.
[33:55.32]Give us a session ID.
[33:58.31]Oh, I'm sorry.
[33:58.87]You have to, like, press a hotkey for us.
[34:02.25]We had progress.
[34:04.05]Dude, it's way past my bedtime.
[34:05.97]If anyone here is going to complain, it's me.
[34:07.55]Yeah, but this game is, like, very fun, though.
[34:09.85]This is fun.
[34:10.51]That was, like, easy.
[34:13.16]And we got one checkpoint.
[34:14.52]That was not easy.
[34:15.08]Turn it up to hard mode.
[34:16.34]Put it on hard, then.
[34:18.92]We can't.
[34:20.18]You know we can't.
[34:21.62]We got practice.
[34:22.34]Then do it on medium.
[34:23.50]But you may have to make the seed, like...
[34:27.02]Something fun.
[34:28.08]No, that is something fun.
[34:31.24]Krungus?
[34:31.78]The last time I touched the seed, it, like, freeze my game.
[34:36.63]Alright.
[34:37.59]We good?
[34:38.09]Who's making it?
[34:39.27]Uh, he's got the code.
[34:41.11]There, I made it.
[34:42.09]We're in here.
[34:43.65]Oh.
[34:44.67]I'm Skull Man again.
[34:45.77]Alright, I'm joining.
[34:50.70]Yeah, why would you join?
[34:51.52]Look, now we understand how the game works.
[34:54.86]I don't.
[34:58.00]But you can kill it.
[34:58.56]You figured out how to kill cows.
[35:00.16]Yeah.
[35:01.58]Stop touching!
[35:02.48]We had it ready like a minute ago and you come in here and start touching shit.
[35:05.80]You can play with checkpoints, though.
[35:08.02]You can restart at the first station in each biome.
[35:10.70]But he left the game because he's just something wrong with him.
[35:13.96]I didn't want to do the same map again, okay?
[35:16.10]Let's go, Etalyx!
[35:21.82]Playing on medium.
[35:22.84]Here we go.
[35:27.10]Alright.
[35:28.70]Pick a tool.
[35:30.39]I'll build the track.
[35:32.89]Keep the tool in your hand.
[35:35.13]Let's do this efficiently, okay?
[35:37.59]I'm just going to break every single one of these blocks.
[35:40.93]I can't say blocks.
[35:42.88]How about this?
[35:44.16]We're going to get so many resources in this first area.
[35:46.46]Jerma is just the pick up resources and then put the track down.
[35:50.48]And we just chop.
[35:52.06]Jerma's already using... I'm pickaxe up top.
[35:58.13]Okay, I need some help putting that stone in.
[36:02.57]Give me one more.
[36:03.29]Get one more across or we're gonna die.
[36:04.73]Excuse me!
[36:12.17]Oh, we gotta do this quick.
[36:13.61]Yeah.
[36:14.76]It's on medium.
[36:27.35]Alright, gold nugget in the waterfall on the top.
[36:30.17]Okay, turn the train, turn the train.
[36:33.33]I'll go get it, I'll get it, I'll get it, I'll get it.
[36:34.70]Alright, you need to make some extra bridges or you're stuck over here.
[36:39.74]I need some wood to get that gold piece.
[36:43.20]Follow me, I'm chopping all of it.
[36:47.75]Star, there's a big water in the bucket.
[36:50.59]There was.
[36:51.57]The flame is out.
[36:52.39]What the fuck, dude?
[36:59.50]Uh, we need a bridge here, or shit's about to get real bad.
[37:01.99]We need a track here.
[37:02.79]Uh-oh, it's about to get real bad.
[37:04.01]Yeah, and we can't bring the track unless you put some wood here and you're the master of all of the woods.
[37:09.43]You need to chop this tree!
[37:11.93]You need to chop this tree!
[37:15.24]Chop, chop!
[37:16.40]I got you, Kevin!
[37:19.81]No, no, we need that pickaxe!
[37:22.25]Back up!
[37:23.39]Back up pickaxe!
[37:24.27]I have the track!
[37:25.85]And the water bucket, dude!
[37:28.21]Dude!
[37:29.31]Dude!
[37:31.29]Oh my god!
[37:32.35]Get the water bucket!
[37:35.03]Alright, I'm gonna put these ahead of us.
[37:42.04]How about these...
[37:56.21]We're gonna drive the train over the gold piece.
[38:04.30]I'm stuck.
[38:10.68]We're going to need some mining and I'm going for it.
[38:16.79]Train's turning too wide.
[38:21.57]Fire up.
[38:23.05]Train's on fire.
[38:26.61]We're good.
[38:27.01]Checkpoint one.
[38:27.95]Done.
[38:28.21]Look at how easy this was.
[38:34.78]One more track, and we can say we did it.
[38:39.70]And let's actually put our points to something cool this time, rather than something stupid.
[38:43.24]Honestly, the things that we did were not bad.
[38:45.78]It was very helpful.
[38:47.26]With three bolts, we only had two.
[38:48.18]They were good.
[38:50.02]Oh, by the way, it's not a gold piece you pick up.
[38:52.64]It's a bolt.
[38:53.84]Gold bolts.
[38:54.54]They're so important.
[38:55.38]Holy shit.
[38:55.66]It's a piece of bolt.
[38:58.50]Convert raw materials to track.
[39:00.76]This is just another one.
[39:01.90]What did you just get?
[39:05.21]You got the one that increases the... I don't know what he got, actually.
[39:09.37]I got increased size.
[39:10.45]It's... Come on.
[39:12.25]It's important.
[39:13.05]Well, there's two that look the same, but they're not the same.
[39:15.07]So you should get the right one.
[39:16.95]I got +2 size.
[39:19.81]Dynamite might be fun.
[39:21.37]Auto-mine commodities.
[39:22.82]That's pretty... That sounds pretty good.
[39:24.78]But we spent all the bolts already.
[39:26.76]So... Jerma just spent the bolt.
[39:32.08]I'm glad we came to consensus.
[39:35.05]Auto-mines things around it.
[39:37.57]That's like a no-brainer.
[39:38.65]That's the first one you should get.
[39:40.85]But when you put it at the front then?
[39:46.53]Instead of the back?
[39:50.48]That doesn't matter.
[39:51.60]What's the radius?
[39:53.86]Can you reorganize?
[39:57.22]Should be right here next to the water tank.
[40:01.51]He just does things.
[40:02.47]Alright, let's go.
[40:04.65]Your little brother, he just did it.
[40:05.87]Let's see if we can get two checkpoints.
[40:11.08]You're like, no, no, no.
[40:12.00]And he presses the button and you're like, okay, I guess that's how we're going to play.
[40:15.92]And I just get my finger jammed almost to the palm of my hand up my nose.
[40:22.81]We going straight?
[40:25.83]Yes.
[40:39.55]Is it auto- look it's auto-mining!
[40:41.45]Is it?
[40:42.39]I actually can't tell what this is doing.
[40:46.00]Now there's an awkward space between where the track comes out and where the track ingredients go in.
[40:50.58]What do the two hamburger buns mean?
[40:53.91]What's that mean?
[41:05.13]I'm just getting materials.
[41:05.81]We can go south and go across the water or go north and go through all the trees.
[41:09.32]I think we just go through all the stuff.
[41:10.60]Forget about going through the water.
[41:11.72]I don't think the auto miner is doing anything.
[41:13.12]Yeah, let's go through the trees.
[41:16.74]Maybe it's got ingredients in there and you have to take them out.
[41:19.46]Feed it stone.
[41:21.02]Put stone in it.
[41:21.90]Alright, I'm... I'm making a turn.
[41:27.10]You don't really have any spare stone.
[41:30.08]We have a lot of it up here.
[41:32.42]Turn south.
[41:33.18]We need trees.
[41:37.92]Yeah, okay.
[41:39.06]It takes... You have to use two stone.
[41:45.38]To turn it on and power it?
[41:48.25]Are we going straight or are we going... We're just going straight, right?
[41:50.61]We're going across the water.
[41:52.31]So we're going down.
[41:53.89]Yeah.
[41:56.09]Okay, go, um... I need... I need to get back up there quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[42:05.75]Are those birds shitting on it?
[42:24.57]Alright, I'm gonna fill up the tank.
[42:26.19]So I think you can preemptively cool the engine with water every so often without having to, like, wait for it to catch on fire.
[42:31.93]Oh, shit, this stuff actually... It does do this.
[42:34.33]Alright, that's actually pretty sick.
[42:37.71]Yeah, it cuts down all, like, everything around it as long as it's got power.
[42:40.69]Wow, why do we get this weird haze?
[42:43.07]It's called fog.
[42:44.47]I know, you only see it when you go outside, but we're not used to that.
[42:46.81]What's going on with this track?
[42:51.11]What's going on with the track?
[42:53.02]Why did that...
[42:59.97]Wait, I'll be making it go.
[43:01.59]What are we doing?
[43:03.03]I would really like to pick this squiggle track up with it.
[43:05.69]It's fine.
[43:06.37]Okay Don't lose that bucket of water I'll turn the train around we miss something Alright
[43:27.42]Fire.
[43:28.08]Oh, it's gonna get dark.
[43:31.06]Shit.
[43:31.42]There's the bucket.
[43:33.60]Shit.
[43:33.90]Dark.
[43:35.07]Shit.
[43:35.47]Get a stack of wood.
[43:36.95]Stack of wood?
[43:37.53]What?
[43:38.95]We gotta make track.
[43:40.57]You gotta get over here.
[43:42.41]I'm chopping wood.
[43:43.22]Just get the wood.
[43:44.10]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[43:47.46]See, now I... This is why I didn't want to come over here.
[43:50.54]This is why I didn't want to come over.
[43:51.96]That's why I didn't want to come over here.
[43:53.94]I'm chopping wood!
[43:55.50]Okay.
[43:55.60]We need... I need... I'm chopping wood.
[44:24.23]Alright, where's the um, are we going up?
[44:26.73]Uh, that's a decision for you guys to make.
[44:28.59]Alright, we're going up.
[44:29.75]Where are the following enemies?
[44:31.39]Already is.
[44:32.11]I gotta kill these boys.
[44:33.23]What's more important right now?
[44:42.64]We don't lose any tools.
[44:43.48]I'm moving the bucket up here.
[44:56.60]Is that gonna crash?
[44:58.59]Yeah.
[45:00.23]Alright, we need stone.
[45:06.59]Don't get caught.
[45:07.19]Uh-oh.
[45:12.08]Okay, just keep the train going straight.
[45:13.98]Look at what we're about to run into.
[45:14.86]You can't dig that stone, person trying to dig the stone.
[45:17.24]I'm trying to have visibility so we can see ahead of us, not dig the stone.
[45:20.95]Hey, person trying to dig the stone up there.
[45:22.97]Alright, we need some extra pass to walk.
[45:33.51]okay we need a lot of wood alright we gotta go uh we got a big big wood path going I'm gonna keep chopping I'm not gonna stop chopping don't expect me to do anything but chop okay what about uh we don't have any stone I got it
[45:59.53]here in a sec big problem incoming stone stone I'm making stone fire where's the bucket oh no I'm getting stuck buckets up there we're good um I don't know what to do there's bolts at the top so don't connect the last piece of track until you have to
[46:35.39]Actually, I don't think there's trees for us to get it.
[46:37.61]Is there not enough trees?
[46:40.19]Hold on.
[46:40.65]There might be.
[46:42.33]I got it.
[46:42.65]I got it.
[46:42.89]We're doing it.
[46:43.61]I got it.
[46:43.87]I got it.
[46:44.05]You guys do this.
[46:45.65]I'm trying to get this thing.
[46:46.43]I need, like, one more piece.
[46:49.00]Can I die if I don't move?
[46:50.68]Is it okay if I connect it?
[46:51.88]I don't know.
[46:53.62]Uh, don't do it yet.
[46:54.26]Because if you connect it, it finishes.
[46:58.16]And then we can't build up materials and stuff.
[47:01.26]Oh, there's a golden ticket.
[47:11.11]We need more wood for that.
[47:14.57]We're going to need another craft.
[47:18.54]The last track is right to the top of you, Stark.
[47:21.24]OK.
[47:22.00]Wood?
[47:22.30]How much more do we have?
[47:23.18]Hold on.
[47:23.54]Hold on.
[47:25.16]It's not enough.
[47:25.62]It's not enough.
[47:26.46]It's not enough.
[47:26.88]It's not enough.
[47:27.44]How do we get more wood?
[47:28.64]We need one wood.
[47:30.73]Is there a trade?
[47:31.15]We'll be able to do it after it parks, theoretically.
[47:37.17]I hope.
[47:40.60]That's not an awkward spot.
[47:42.80]I'm just going to buy a random thing.
[47:44.66]We only have one bolt, so we could just save.
[47:53.08]Why not just save?
[47:54.70]I want crafting speed stack size.
[47:57.83]That's not bad, actually.
[47:59.29]Put it in a good spot.
[48:00.95]Don't do what I did.
[48:02.55]That's not a good spot.
[48:03.91]Crafting speed stack size.
[48:05.73]We were not once waiting on the track.
[48:08.59]What have you done?
[48:11.10]The stack size is nice, because then you can take stuff... Because we always have, like, a full stack of shit in here.
[48:18.54]Well, it works out.
[48:19.72]I mean, you could... If we saved, you could actually make the auto-miner, like, good.
[48:25.98]Let's go.
[48:26.96]+2 range on the auto-miner.
[48:30.25]I mean, that's pretty good, too.
[48:32.99]We only have one bolt.
[48:34.83]Volkswagen and Dynamite are the best.
[48:38.18]Also, a better craft... Like, you can get a second raw material wagon.
[48:42.70]Okay, but we only had one bolt.
[48:44.10]And now we have no bolts.
[48:45.70]What does this let you do?
[48:46.74]Die?
[48:49.19]What does a ghost wagon do?
[48:50.37]Let you die?
[48:52.47]Go to the other side.
[48:53.33]What does that mean?
[48:57.25]We can still get that.
[49:00.63]Yeah.
[49:01.77]We can wrap around and get it.
[49:03.34]We can just walk to it.
[49:04.28]Holy shit.
[49:05.68]Oh, man.
[49:06.42]We can just walk to it.
[49:08.74]We could just walk through.
[49:11.72]We need to work pretty fast because we're in this awkward... Yeah.
[49:17.18]I'm trying to dig wide so we have some space to move.
[49:25.65]There's a bunch of stone on the other side of the river, too.
[49:27.51]We don't need stone at the moment.
[49:30.09]Power this thing on.
[49:36.51]Alright, um...
[49:38.42]Oh, fuck.
[49:39.94]Oh, fuck.
[49:40.48]Oh, fuck.
[49:41.21]Oh, fuck.
[49:42.11]I can't reach it.
[49:43.37]Hold on.
[49:43.77]I can't.
[49:44.17]Move.
[49:50.17]Okay.
[49:51.21]Jesus Christ.
[49:52.57]I panicked.
[49:52.96]I'm glad I was not involved in that.
[49:55.40]I panicked.
[49:55.80]I'm sorry.
[49:57.08]I thought... Who are these bandits?
[50:03.28]I don't know.
[50:03.68]I've been killing them.
[50:08.83]I think they steal your stuff if you let them, probably.
[50:11.13]Alright, we're gonna double up.
[50:14.89]We still have access, by the way, to the pickaxe.
[50:17.20]Where is it?
[50:17.50]Okay.
[50:22.10]What do we need?
[50:24.36]We need tracks down.
[50:25.08]Make some calls, make some calls.
[50:25.88]What do we need?
[50:27.28]I got it.
[50:28.04]We're gonna go follow the rubber ducky where... Or just follow where he's digging right now.
[50:39.55]We need stone delivered.
[50:40.69]And then we need wood.
[50:48.16]We got wood and stone.
[50:49.14]There you go.
[50:49.52]We got wood.
[50:50.10]Alright.
[50:51.18]Dig.
[50:51.60]I'm going to mine like a secondary path.
[50:58.68]Each player has to mine a rock.
[51:00.42]What did it say?
[51:02.36]It's like an achievement thing.
[51:03.68]Alright.
[51:06.92]We need to kill the cows.
[51:10.03]They move out of the way.
[51:11.05]You really don't.
[51:13.99]I just wanted to kill some cows.
[51:15.21]Put some stone in that machine.
[51:16.05]Get some of that beef.
[51:16.89]Alright, where's that pickaxe?
[51:22.52]I got it.
[51:22.92]Let's lay down here too.
[51:27.84]What?
[51:28.52]So we can have two paths.
[51:32.44]What are you saying?
[51:34.07]See the wooden path I made to the stone?
[51:35.49]That's just more stone.
[51:41.81]go forward does the auto yeah the auto miners just got stuff so wait can you believe we hit the cows or what no they walk away from the truck walk away okay alright we need trees we need this cut down up front and then it's we're pretty much there I'm going for the tree we got a bolt
[52:12.05]I will let you do it.
[52:15.11]Fire.
[52:16.79]Oh, it's on fire.
[52:17.57]Bucket's right up, right on top, top.
[52:18.87]Right next to the star.
[52:19.76]No, italic.
[52:20.22]Who's penguin?
[52:21.34]I'm penguin.
[52:21.96]Alright, italic's penguin.
[52:23.12]Yeah, you got it.
[52:24.96]Alright, this is, this is an absolute shitload of materials down here.
[52:27.72]Start collecting.
[52:28.70]Feed the, uh, auto miner.
[52:35.68]Looking good.
[52:36.22]It is looking good.
[52:37.02]Well, don't waste resources on the auto miner when it's not near anything.
[52:41.22]Does it consume while it's not near anything, I wonder?
[52:44.20]Yeah, it does.
[52:45.10]You can see it digging up grass.
[52:48.65]It's digging grass.
[52:53.75]I wonder if there's an upgrade so we can carry more stuff in our hands.
[52:56.61]Because currently, what, it's two or three?
[52:58.99]Actually, I don't have any tools.
[53:11.36]Looking good.
[53:12.10]Do we have any secret loot?
[53:15.77]There's one over here, but we can get it later.
[53:17.15]Probably just get it right now, actually.
[53:20.25]How are we doing on track?
[53:22.59]We got like a small stack back there.
[53:24.89]We don't have a lot of wood.
[53:27.45]But we're about to win.
[53:30.58]There is so much stone that I've put here.
[53:33.12]I think there's enough to get both, isn't there?
[53:41.59]Well, yeah, hold on.
[53:42.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[53:43.13]Don't, don't, don't.
[53:43.55]Wait, wait, wait.
[53:44.05]Make sure we have enough track to complete the level.
[53:49.37]This is more important.
[53:50.21]I want gold.
[53:51.13]No, I... I didn't... Whatever.
[54:00.91]Can I pick up the last two?
[54:01.87]Fire.
[54:05.47]Where's the bucket?
[54:06.40]Where's the bucket?
[54:09.90]Oh, it's not full.
[54:11.48]Where's the bucket?
[54:12.76]He's got it.
[54:13.36]Alright, we need one more.
[54:24.83]Still on fire somehow.
[54:28.13]Are we out of wood?
[54:29.23]No.
[54:30.29]We just need one more track.
[54:33.67]Alright, complete it.
[54:41.96]oh yeah that's what I'm talking about four bolts alright that's that could be a new engine if we wanted it well what about the the juice box increases your strength for every animal you bring by that's that's carrying capacity liquid storage
[55:07.73]You feed cows and you get juice.
[55:09.56]Plus 100% capacity.
[55:11.10]That's pretty good.
[55:12.02]How do you do that?
[55:16.88]Alright.
[55:19.54]Miner tier two.
[55:22.16]Can I not move it ever?
[55:24.16]No.
[55:24.22]How are you doing that, sir?
[55:27.30]If you write your right analog stick, you press it down, you can create like waypoints.
[55:31.79]It's kind of annoying.
[55:33.59]And then left trigger and right trigger are emotes.
[55:40.12]What did we buy?
[55:40.78]I bought the Miner Expander.
[55:45.56]If you're going to have it, it may as well do something.
[55:47.52]What about, halt the train for a short time, dash into it to fill up its charge?
[55:52.39]I don't know how to dash.
[55:53.27]Oh.
[55:54.73]Dash is B. Oh, now we can knock each other off the bridge like in Overcooked 2.
[56:00.26]Are we saving the points or what?
[56:05.10]I vote for...
[56:08.60]I'm down with the stack size.
[56:10.18]Is that just the normal platform?
[56:11.68]Pulse the train for a short time.
[56:14.26]Dash into it to fill up its charge.
[56:15.83]I feel like we're accidentally going to activate that.
[56:18.25]Yeah, we probably are.
[56:20.95]I kind of don't want our train to be longer right now because we keep getting caught on it.
[56:26.61]100% capacity.
[56:27.09]We could save.
[56:31.43]I mean, capacity is just capacity.
[56:34.09]Well, that's for the water, right?
[56:36.59]What is this thing for?
[56:39.26]Executive decision.
[56:40.72]What'd you grab?
[56:45.28]What was that?
[56:46.00]Oh, now we're going to make track at a thousand times normal speed.
[56:49.34]Yeah.
[56:52.23]Wait, what was that one?
[56:54.57]Increase the capacity and build speed for tracks.
[56:57.61]Waypoint's pretty useful planning a track.
[57:01.99]True.
[57:02.25]Alright, I hope you guys are ready to start smashing some trees.
[57:10.63]Alright.
[57:12.11]They delete all yours.
[57:13.17]Oh, no.
[57:14.01]We got to go water preemptively just for when we need to douse it.
[57:27.43]Capacity.
[57:28.21]Good.
[57:29.13]Cool.
[57:29.87]Auto mine.
[57:30.23]We're going to need to start mining stone up here.
[57:36.09]Which way are we going?
[57:36.79]Up or just to the right?
[57:38.63]Up and then right.
[57:44.03]What's up here?
[57:45.61]Where's the stone?
[57:46.61]You turned the track around.
[57:47.95]Yeah, hang on.
[57:49.17]What are you talking about?
[57:51.03]You did, yeah.
[57:52.37]That's not what you wanted to do?
[57:55.03]No.
[58:00.76]You didn't want to go down and then over?
[58:04.28]How'd you do that?
[58:04.70]Up and then right?
[58:19.91]Alright, we need to start chopping trees.
[58:21.81]You just turned it around.
[58:29.67]Yeah, whatever.
[58:30.89]Well, I thought you, like, doomed it again that we couldn't remove the thing, but I think Etalyx you removed.
[58:36.55]I saved it.
[58:37.81]You can remove it if it hasn't driven over it.
[58:40.57]Oh.
[58:42.54]Alright, we have a ton of wood.
[58:46.36]Okay.
[58:47.44]Like, too much to even... I don't even know what to do with it.
[58:55.06]There's nothing... no bridges to build.
[58:57.64]Do you have a bucket of water?
[59:03.53]Oh, thank god.
[59:13.41]Do more auto-mining?
[59:16.33]I feel like eventually that would be the best bet, I think, right?
[59:20.15]Is just to have a super auto miner and just build track.
[59:22.51]Alright, can you, uh, chop the trees that are... Gonna go adjacent to where we're building?
[59:34.84]Yes.
[59:37.48]Well, shouldn't we not... Because if we keep doing that, and then the auto miner doesn't do anything.
[59:43.16]Well, it should do something while it's next to all these rocks.
[59:50.96]Nice.
[59:54.78]Speaking of rocks.
[59:55.82]We need some.
[59:56.76]Yeah.
[60:02.58]That has to be... That has to be... This stone has to be in there for it to auto-mine in the first place.
[60:07.99]How do you set those up from a distance?
[60:11.55]Yeah.
[60:12.13]That's... You just click down right stick.
[60:17.41]I'm trapped over here.
[60:19.80]I need a woodcutter.
[60:21.28]Okay.
[60:23.42]I can't help you there.
[60:24.04]Alright.
[60:33.54]That's auto-mining now.
[60:38.41]Wow.
[60:38.79]That's insane.
[60:39.87]That's...
[60:50.12]This one was easy.
[60:54.68]So you can pick up cows.
[60:56.12]Okay, we're on fire.
[60:57.16]Bucket is off the screen.
[61:00.58]This one was... Oh my god, you got it.
[61:07.23]That was close.
[61:10.05]We need to chop down here.
[61:12.75]What a good seed this was.
[61:14.55]Quickly, chop down here or else you're dead.
[61:18.26]It's right next to you.
[61:19.48]Where is it?
[61:23.10]Oh, there is a way out anyway.
[61:28.20]Alright.
[61:28.86]You still got to chop up there.
[61:29.86]You got to chop right here.
[61:32.22]Right here.
[61:32.78]Right here.
[61:33.36]Where I'm standing.
[61:36.12]Quickly.
[61:36.92]Guys.
[61:37.97]No, we're good here.
[61:39.31]Guys.
[61:40.41]Chop up.
[61:44.85]I think you're severely underestimating the severity of the situation.
[61:48.53]Yes, he is.
[61:49.03]He doesn't understand that we can't get the track over there.
[61:53.04]you're crazy dude my god alright are we good any special things or just go there's a nugget in the top but there's no conceivable way to get that okay it's on fire and the bucket's gone that's okay we made it does it put itself out uh yes we only have one bolt can't even buy another let's go
[62:24.60]Someone needs to be, like, on constant, vigilant bucket duty.
[62:28.28]Yeah.
[62:28.68]We could just buy the upgrade.
[62:30.48]Yeah.
[62:32.60]Yep.
[62:37.11]We're gonna have a problem here in two seconds.
[62:38.97]What's that?
[62:41.23]Because it's a very straight, narrow line, and, uh, this just got way hard.
[62:44.32]Let's go completely straight.
[62:46.48]Just go straight.
[62:47.04]Straight, straight, straight.
[62:57.84]Ayaya.
[62:57.96]Ayaya!
[63:07.08]There's a stone.
[63:08.08]Crack.
[63:09.08]Put stone in there.
[62:59.59]Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack! Crack!
[63:17.15]I'm having stress.
[63:22.15]Okay.
[63:23.39]Bucket!
[63:23.73]Bucket!
[63:24.03]Don't leave the bucket.
[63:24.75]This is really, really claustrophobic right now.
[63:27.11]Don't leave this bucket back here.
[63:28.93]What?
[63:30.48]Alright, we're good.
[63:35.04]I'm just... I'm 100% digging.
[63:36.42]Right here.
[63:38.00]Oh, man.
[63:38.60]We are...
[63:43.73]Do you see the tree to your left?
[63:45.61]We're going to run out of stone unless I go up.
[63:46.93]Do you see the tree directly in front of the penguin that's spinning around?
[63:50.03]Oh, guys?
[63:50.71]Guys, it's over.
[63:51.69]Guys, it's over.
[63:52.69]It's not over.
[63:53.05]It's not over.
[63:53.33]It's not over.
[63:54.65]Stone.
[63:54.99]We need a lot of stone.
[63:58.54]There's a bridge to come up around the corner.
[64:00.74]Up top around the engine.
[64:03.22]I got a lot of stone.
[64:10.31]You're not finished!
[64:12.17]I'm sorry, I'm- I'm sorry.
[64:16.35]Uh, get the auto-miner on.
[64:17.55]I got- I got it, I got it, I got it.
[64:19.63]I don't wanna get stuck back here, fuck!
[64:24.34]We're stuck.
[64:25.24]Uh, me and- oh, hold on.
[64:26.32]There we go.
[64:28.86]Okay, hold on.
[64:31.94]Don't leave!
[64:32.34]We're gonna need this pickaxe up here soon.
[64:34.09]I got it.
[64:35.81]Where- what do you need it?
[64:37.69]Eventually we're gonna need to start digging.
[64:41.42]okay that's too cool nobody we can't all get in there I'm trying my best we're out of stone no we're not no we're not no we're not no we're not no we're not I'm gonna go straight straight straight get this this one right here I'm standing right in front of we need a lot of stone whoever's got the pickaxe needs to go it's running to pickaxe to the left to the left to the right alright someone go feed it stone and get the the track yep yep yep yep
[65:14.24]I didn't do it.
[65:14.62]Alright, I'm making a path for you to come through.
[65:20.85]Fuck it.
[65:21.47]Fuck it.
[65:21.89]Fuck it.
[65:22.19]Alert.
[65:22.73]Fuck it.
[65:23.01]Alert.
[65:23.31]Fuck it.
[65:23.57]Alert.
[65:29.23]Uh, we're going to need a two by two path.
[65:30.83]We're screwed in a second.
[65:32.27]What do you mean?
[65:34.23]This isn't, we're not going to be able to get to the back of the train.
[65:37.42]Oh shit.
[65:37.92]Hold on.
[65:44.03]We're fine.
[65:44.39]We're good.
[65:45.07]We're alive.
[65:47.67]I got a thousand stone on me.
[65:54.85]I have made it two by two all the way to the station.
[66:06.02]Oh, no!
[66:06.73]Fuck!
[66:08.24]We're gonna miss the, uh, we're gonna miss the, uh, the bolt, the bolt, the bolt.
[66:12.57]We can still get it.
[66:14.39]You, I'll do this.
[66:15.13]You guys focus on that.
[66:15.81]I'll get this.
[66:16.51]Where's the pickaxe?
[66:18.07]I got it.
[66:18.77]You, uh, you build the, the track.
[66:20.81]Okay, go up and get that bolt.
[66:22.19]I need it through.
[66:24.01]I need it through.
[66:25.97]I need through.
[66:26.71]Alright, don't, okay, I got the last piece.
[66:31.20]Oh, no, no, no.
[66:34.46]Just hold it.
[66:36.58]I'm only two away.
[66:40.49]I got it.
[66:41.23]Yeah.
[66:44.73]Don't leave me behind up in the mountains.
[66:46.95]You'll be alright.
[66:49.53]Alright, we got four.
[66:53.15]Oh, yeah.
[66:56.64]Alright, I'm in favor of water capacity up 100%.
[67:00.54]What's this new one?
[67:02.34]Shows you the way.
[67:04.20]Auto pickup things placed nearby.
[67:06.12]I mean, I think auto pickup...
[67:10.92]And water capacity.
[67:17.50]Yeah, I'm in favor.
[67:19.26]Auto pickup is pretty huge.
[67:22.10]This is a new thing.
[67:23.66]I want to put it at the front, or should I put it after the auto miner?
[67:27.58]Maybe put it at the end.
[67:29.18]Yeah, right back.
[67:29.94]Because then that would just get everything we missed.
[67:34.90]No, put it in the front.
[67:37.20]It's most likely we're going to be digging near the front.
[67:44.91]You want water tank in front, or... Auto... Auto mine in front.
[67:48.09]Yeah, but I already fucked that up.
[67:50.53]Put it in the front.
[67:51.19]Auto pick up in front.
[67:52.81]Alright, auto pick up in front.
[67:54.35]And then the capacity.
[67:56.40]By the way, you can only have five pieces, so be aware of that.
[67:59.10]We now cannot add anything else.
[68:00.72]Crap.
[68:01.22]Really?
[68:02.14]Five out of five wagons.
[68:06.30]Oh.
[68:07.80]Mine front, pick back.
[68:09.90]Well, that's what I was thinking, but apparently not.
[68:16.04]uh where are the tools right here it's all wood yeah it's all wood uh go backwards and start getting there's stone on the ground I can't go up here how do you fuel the auto pickup uh auto pickup is wood I can't go back there was the uh
[68:44.63]We're about to lose already.
[68:46.85]We're good.
[68:48.15]I'm stuck.
[68:49.80]Free him and bring the bucket.
[68:53.78]Already nighttime?
[68:56.00]We're dead.
[68:58.38]We don't have any stone.
[68:59.84]We have tracks in the back that no one picked up.
[69:02.24]Oh.
[69:02.84]We're fine.
[69:03.14]We're fine.
[69:03.42]We're good.
[69:05.60]Give him some swirls.
[69:07.04]Well, if you give him some swirls, then we... How do we get to the back now?
[69:15.19]That's a you guys problem.
[69:16.17]Oh, no, it's an us problem.
[69:18.11]Just walk around.
[69:19.52]It looked like it was obstructed.
[69:21.36]You were not even trying.
[69:23.46]To be fair, it's really dark and scary.
[69:35.47]Should we go straight or up?
[69:37.45]Do we have to go...
[69:40.93]Let's see what happens if we go up.
[69:41.75]Yeah, we're going to have to lose.
[69:44.49]Two by two.
[69:44.99]Two by two.
[69:45.41]We need wood.
[69:46.21]That's you.
[69:46.59]You need the two by two.
[69:47.66]Jerma, you need the two by two.
[69:49.54]You need to turn around and free us.
[69:52.00]Right here.
[69:57.18]Faster.
[70:00.65]Got it.
[70:02.25]Then bring stone immediately.
[70:05.17]Bring stone immediately.
[70:06.85]I mean.
[70:08.33]Alright, now what?
[70:12.53]Two by two.
[70:13.35]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[70:15.32]You're nudging me.
[70:19.48]What?
[70:20.82]You're pushing me.
[70:21.50]Were you going to file a lawsuit because I flicked your ear?
[70:25.60]Yes.
[70:26.78]I'm coming with track.
[70:30.44]We're going around?
[70:31.74]I would just... I would just... Why are you doing that?
[70:35.92]We don't have any trees.
[70:37.82]Are there any trees up here?
[70:38.86]We're out of trees.
[70:40.00]We need to just... Where am I?
[70:41.54]Right here, right here, right here, right here.
[70:43.14]Someone come get the bucket.
[70:45.40]Where's the bucket?
[70:47.38]It's way back there, but we have to... Thank God we can see.
[70:50.60]Alright.
[70:53.35]We need... We're going up.
[70:55.23]I'm going to chop some wood.
[70:57.27]We need wood.
[70:58.45]The wood's up here.
[71:03.22]Wood by me.
[71:07.42]I need this bucket moved.
[71:12.18]You can just put it down, right?
[71:14.00]Oh, okay.
[71:14.30]I have to place the track.
[71:19.58]Ooh, that's a tight squeeze.
[71:20.78]Is that going to bump?
[71:22.46]No.
[71:28.68]Look at what the auto-miner is doing.
[71:29.98]It's doing so well.
[71:30.78]We need wood instantly.
[71:31.94]It's all up here.
[71:32.74]All up by me.
[71:33.28]There's like a thousand of it.
[71:35.71]I think this is it.
[71:37.15]I think this is it.
[71:38.27]This is not it.
[71:38.69]This is it.
[71:41.09]No, we lost the engine.
[71:45.11]That's alright.
[71:46.15]It's going like faster now.
[71:49.01]Stand in front of it!
[71:50.11]Stand in front of it!
[71:53.50]Alright, we start from checkpoint.
[72:00.79]That was hard.
[72:01.87]That one was hard.
[72:02.59]It was a lot of zigzags.
[72:05.72]Someone said in all capitals, this is what we get for wasting the auto miner.
[72:09.78]That's true.
[72:11.04]It is.
[72:12.40]We could have had auto miner plus auto collector right behind it.
[72:17.70]Do we get to start a checkpoint?
[72:18.82]Why are we stuck at connecting?
[72:20.74]Yeah, I'm stuck at connecting too.
[72:22.90]Star, are you like all tapped?
[72:28.20]Reach from zero.
[72:31.80]Was this not even the... We didn't even finish the first biome?
[72:35.19]No, we did not.
[72:36.01]Save it at last checkpoint.
[72:37.43]What?
[72:39.31]We didn't even finish the first biome.
[72:42.90]Okay, now it's like six hours past my bedtime.
[72:45.00]I just had insane deja vu right now.
[72:53.91]Alright.
[72:54.11]We'll clean it up.
[72:54.81]This is the same seat.
[72:56.05]So you want everything identical or do you want RNG fun?
[72:58.03]You want to do RNG fun?
[72:59.75]Well, that's why I left last time and everyone yelled at me.
[73:02.27]Well, I thought there was a different checkpoint.
[73:04.31]Alright.
[73:07.29]RNG fun.
[73:08.03]Guys, the train needs to be upgraded to save the game.
[73:10.90]We need to do the four on the new... That's how you get to a new area.
[73:14.34]Oh.
[73:15.22]Is it?
[73:15.78]Uh-huh.
[73:18.38]Yeah.
[73:23.46]Right in the tutorial.
[73:28.26]Alright, well, what do you guys want to do?
[73:30.00]You want to give it another go?
[73:32.12]I want to eat dinner.
[73:34.32]One more.
[73:34.82]One more real attack.
[73:39.24]Right?
[73:40.60]Look, hey, just order whatever you want.
[73:42.58]Put it on my fucking cart.
[73:44.24]I'm not ordering dinner.
[73:45.42]That's irresponsible.
[73:50.65]I want to do one more.
[73:53.89]One more could be like three hours if we get good.
[73:57.59]Yeah.
[73:59.25]Then get good.
[74:02.33]I don't want to walk over the two because this is his opportunity to leave.
[74:07.89]Are we still playing?
[74:08.37]We just did one more and you died in the tutorial.
[74:13.51]You think we're really going to go three hours?
[74:14.55]I don't want to redo the lobby.
[74:17.12]That's what it is.
[74:17.78]He doesn't want to do the lobby again.
[74:19.16]Well, come over here.
[74:19.98]Come over here.
[74:21.10]Let's go.
[74:21.49]Let's go.
[74:21.77]Let's go.
[74:21.97]Let's hurry.
[74:22.39]Let's fucking hurry.
[74:23.69]He doesn't want to type the five-character code.
[74:27.27]Just let him eat.
[74:27.97]I'm saying just put... Eat whatever you want.
[74:30.87]Well, speaking of, the five-letter code's right there.
[74:32.87]The five-letter code has been leaked.
[74:34.63]So... I hit BRB.
[74:39.10]Sex.
[74:39.76]Facts.
[74:44.33]Go.
[74:45.93]Does it matter or do we not even care?
[74:47.87]It's already leaked.
[74:49.25]Go.
[74:53.58]Sex fact.
[75:02.14]This is the one.
[75:02.74]Alright, we got some awkward initial stone.
[75:18.58]once to be fair you were not doing two by two that's why I need someone to tell me no I wasn't I was me I was just simply trying to do an impression of one of you two you're mean
[75:46.98]Are we just going to go straight?
[75:48.04]Like, what are we doing here?
[75:49.38]I think straight's probably because straight is more resources.
[75:54.10]If you can't fit the things, just make a wood stack next to it.
[76:02.15]Yeah, if we just go straight, the thing is over there.
[76:08.23]Just don't... Forget about those enemies.
[76:10.79]Wait.
[76:11.11]No, we have to kill them.
[76:13.05]Keep your commodities safe from bandits.
[76:15.83]Yeah, they're stealing our stuff.
[76:18.71]Just smash them.
[76:21.27]Well, as we know, property is more valuable than human lives, so kill them.
[76:24.49]Okay, we need to dig straight.
[76:28.37]Jesus Christ.
[76:38.48]Where's the bucket?
[76:41.08]Where's the bucket?
[76:41.76]Where's the bucket?
[76:42.56]I haven't seen a bucket.
[76:48.09]Get there quick, get there quick, get there quick.
[76:49.81]Just get there quick.
[76:50.94]Straight line.
[76:51.42]Before it burns.
[76:53.80]Alright, two by two, Jarvis.
[77:02.71]Two by two.
[77:03.47]It doesn't matter.
[77:04.27]We just have to go.
[77:10.66]That's not me doing it anymore.
[77:12.40]Yeah, because as soon as you place down the last track, we got it.
[77:16.32]Is that a dinosaur?
[77:17.26]Alright, we're done.
[77:19.22]Yeah, place it.
[77:23.06]There's a dinosaur where the pickaxe is.
[77:27.24]There is a dinosaur.
[77:28.44]Is that a new character?
[77:29.33]No, someone joined because it was public.
[77:32.59]Well, it is a new character then.
[77:34.51]Wait, somebody's in the game?
[77:36.23]Yeah, somebody's in the game.
[77:39.67]Well, hey.
[77:40.71]Somebody got in.
[77:45.87]Well, hey, a fourth person, this just, like, helps.
[77:48.21]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[77:50.85]There's no money to spend.
[77:51.97]You guys just fucking dilly-dally.
[77:54.83]I gotta eat dinner.
[77:56.39]Hey, well, whatever.
[77:57.59]This is just, like, a Major League Baseball mascot.
[78:04.16]They're gonna be, like, so helpful.
[78:05.92]I know.
[78:06.32]Wow, we shouldn't even be upset about this.
[78:09.92]Yeah, until he doesn't 2x2.
[78:11.08]He's not.
[78:13.36]Do you think they get the dinosaur costume without 2x2ing?
[78:18.69]I think it's random.
[78:19.39]I think, I think you can just pick any costume.
[78:23.21]Alright, we don't have any, can't mine the stone.
[78:26.69]Oh, he's mined.
[78:27.11]Should we just go straight?
[78:29.08]Uh, well, the... Let's go down.
[78:34.09]Well, Dingo the Dinosaur wants us to go this way, so that's where we're going.
[78:40.45]Is that M doing this?
[78:42.48]That's me.
[78:43.04]That is the second one.
[78:48.08]Which, I believe this one.
[78:52.62]Yeah, our Sims 3 entrance mascot is going to help us out here.
[78:59.51]Not Sims 3.
[79:00.15]Rollercoaster Tycoon 3.
[79:10.22]I could have fucking just called that guy in Germany and got him to play with him.
[79:15.85]Yeah, but then... Then what?
[79:20.31]Well, I don't want to say, but... Then you end up with Devin Cole, who's like, alright, and the other features we've got here, there are 17 different character models.
[79:29.06]You guys haven't been paying attention.
[79:31.16]He already got the bolt.
[79:34.98]Lookit.
[79:35.68]I saw that.
[79:36.75]Did you, though?
[79:37.23]Yeah.
[79:42.10]I'm stuck on this tree.
[79:43.18]What if this is the death?
[79:46.36]They're playing like a death.
[79:47.66]Because he has common sense, it's like he's too smart.
[79:50.31]He's just chopping trees, you know?
[79:52.15]It's called keeping your head down.
[79:56.27]We're going... We're going too slow.
[80:03.37]The Mario level's not auto-scrolling fast enough.
[80:06.19]He wants to keep going faster.
[80:19.47]It's because we have a slow-ass train.
[80:31.33]Stone, stone!
[80:34.27]Yeah, this person just took over.
[80:36.91]He's just chomping like a maniac.
[80:39.27]They're so good.
[80:40.13]Hey, Star, I hope you know that we probably will be here for three hours, because we have somebody that actually knows everything.
[80:44.89]Well, now I can leave it down to the three players, which was efficient.
[80:50.54]Let's keep Dinosaur mascot.
[80:55.36]That's so fun.
[80:59.40]Yeah, we're doing too good.
[81:03.46]We have a surplus.
[81:05.69]There's like a thousand wood, my man.
[81:07.58]What is that extra zig for?
[81:09.30]Look at all this.
[81:13.22]Wait, you want to go that way?
[81:14.26]Oh, we have to go that way.
[81:17.08]Oh, shit.
[81:18.20]Watch out.
[81:24.14]We got too many resources.
[81:25.42]Does anyone want to take care of that?
[81:28.16]Fire!
[81:39.78]I love that dinosaur.
[81:44.35]It's a reptard.
[81:46.17]I love the animation.
[81:47.09]The animation is the best.
[81:48.07]He just leans back and forth with his head.
[81:57.00]Alright, um... This is a pain in the ass level one.
[81:59.56]Uh, by the way, we also have to address... We have to address another thing.
[82:03.68]Um... Didn't you have the game as unjoinable selected?
[82:09.04]Well, it was no randoms.
[82:10.24]They had the private code.
[82:12.32]Oh.
[82:13.80]There's like a random matchmaking as well.
[82:19.97]Well, we got a straightaway here.
[82:23.29]For one second, I heard the like, dunk, dunk, dunk.
[82:25.29]And I thought that was the train.
[82:26.56]You running up the track.
[82:29.29]It is.
[82:30.31]Alright, stream viewer.
[82:33.47]If you pick a single upgrade in there immediately, you're dead.
[82:37.69]You're dead.
[82:38.93]In fact, we'll probably just let him pick all the upgrades.
[82:41.57]He probably knows the exact placement.
[82:43.13]We should probably just give him our stream key.
[82:51.58]Don't leave us behind.
[82:52.28]Alright, we have four bolts.
[83:04.32]He's like, do this one.
[83:06.02]Auto pick up commodities.
[83:08.28]I like auto pick up commodities.
[83:10.92]This might not be good.
[83:13.95]We had so many that we need some stack size too.
[83:16.57]Because we had so many commodities.
[83:19.61]That there's four of us.
[83:22.03]Now the thing is, do these stay or do they come back?
[83:25.72]I think they randomly roll.
[83:27.56]Because if it's random every time, then get it now.
[83:32.10]Yeah, where do we put it?
[83:32.74]If it stays there through the next one, then... Right in the front.
[83:45.12]Yeah, put it right in the front, and then we'll get the auto miner to go in front of that one.
[83:51.44]Hey, I'm... I'm obeying the auto miner.
[83:58.12]So the new engine lets us save?
[84:01.31]The new engine means we are at a new place.
[84:04.96]That's the new biome, which means that allows us to restart from that biome.
[84:10.40]Are we going down?
[84:14.08]Who knows?
[84:15.20]I don't know.
[84:16.42]I'm sure.
[84:19.82]Although this is going right into unmindable territory.
[84:23.78]Alright, can you chop to the right?
[84:25.10]Yeah, we're gonna go this way.
[84:26.35]We're gonna have to make a bridge.
[84:27.41]Yeah.
[84:28.29]Bridge is necessary.
[84:29.53]Hello, it's me, Dino.
[84:39.09]Please mod me.
[84:51.95]Oh, is it?
[84:52.31]Alright.
[84:54.30]We got stone up ahead.
[84:57.50]Holy shit.
[84:58.52]Look at all that track.
[84:59.56]Where did it even come from?
[85:03.08]We've just been doing it.
[85:04.46]Is this just what happens when you add a fourth player who is also a dinosaur, who is also a dev?
[85:09.04]What's also like anybody is a warm body, and this game doesn't change difficulty based on how many people are in it.
[85:22.10]I'm so hungry why don't you eat some of these rocks I haven't seen my wife in days key I'm so hungry so well I told you just get whatever you want what do you want pizza I want to make my dinner what do you want pizza what do you what do you kids want tonight order me a pizza
[86:07.32]Where's the wood?
[86:08.84]We need wood to make... That's all I've been doing since we've loaded into this level.
[86:15.75]You could do more.
[86:23.39]Who's the dino?
[86:24.45]We don't know.
[86:24.89]It's a mystery dino.
[86:26.73]Don't lose that pickaxe.
[86:29.75]Don't lose that pickaxe.
[86:48.12]Well, that went very smoothly.
[86:49.94]Did we see any secrets, though?
[86:52.30]Yeah, I think you just got it.
[86:53.28]I think you just got the bulb.
[86:57.88]We need a little bridge.
[86:59.88]A little bridge?
[87:02.21]Up top.
[87:03.05]The bridge needs to go up.
[87:06.29]What?
[87:06.49]How are we going to connect to this over the water?
[87:08.21]We need a bridge over the water.
[87:09.45]Right, there's like bamboo shoots.
[87:10.63]Oh, fuck.
[87:11.13]Alright.
[87:11.41]We're good.
[87:11.67]We're good.
[87:11.89]We're good.
[87:13.13]Right here.
[87:14.31]Look at this dev dino.
[87:15.61]Look at this.
[87:17.44]I'm just watching!
[87:18.14]Alright, I'm gonna have to do something.
[87:19.80]Just- just- there's wood right here, just do it.
[87:23.28]This- I- I- again, I'm gonna say, I really don't think it takes a developer to connect point A to point B. Um... That's not how- that's not how this goes.
[87:36.77]I- I chop wood, um... That's not how this goes!
[87:44.13]Everyone mine a rock, quick!
[87:52.23]This one?
[87:52.61]Auto-miner.
[87:53.79]Me.
[87:55.49]No, me.
[87:57.02]I'm just having fun watching the dinosaur play.
[88:01.56]What about this thing?
[88:03.62]We can't have any more.
[88:04.92]Converts wood to iron.
[88:06.12]Oh, that's it, yeah.
[88:07.76]No more, that's it.
[88:11.32]No more, that's it.
[88:12.54]No more, that's it.
[88:13.32]It's five out of five.
[88:16.80]Stand in the square.
[88:19.04]I thought I was.
[88:21.46]That guy stood in it.
[88:22.32]He must have been a dev.
[88:26.32]Okay.
[88:26.94]Get your joke out.
[88:29.05]Get your jokes out.
[88:32.19]They're funny.
[88:32.73]They're really funny.
[88:33.59]Although they can sometimes be hurtful to me.
[88:36.25]Alright.
[88:39.49]So auto miner boy is on and auto collector is on at the same time.
[88:42.77]That's pretty good.
[88:44.88]Let's see what happened.
[88:45.88]Are we just going straight or what?
[88:50.10]Guess so.
[88:50.70]Ooh, there's a golden nugget.
[88:52.48]Where is it?
[88:52.86]Oh, it's there.
[88:54.44]I'm going to put this all the way over here because I know no one's going to remember that it's over there.
[89:27.71]Down, down, down.
[89:39.85]Cool.
[89:41.65]How we doing?
[89:42.07]We're going to need a two by two pretty soon or the auto miner to be powered or both.
[89:46.45]I'm going to power the auto miner right now.
[89:51.01]Auto miner is on.
[89:55.78]Alright, I'm gonna start.
[89:56.54]We need some stone, right?
[89:57.18]I'm stuck.
[89:57.46]Are we stuck?
[89:58.82]Uh-oh.
[90:00.20]Uh-oh.
[90:00.84]Alert!
[90:01.30]Alert!
[90:02.04]Alert!
[90:02.48]Alert!
[90:03.06]Alert!
[90:10.71]Now we need a miner down here.
[90:12.27]What happened to the two by two?
[90:14.23]I was screamed at.
[90:15.49]I got it.
[90:15.73]I got it.
[90:16.01]I got it.
[90:16.35]It's in my hand.
[90:24.83]Get rid of these trees down here.
[90:26.85]Nice, nice, nice, nice, nice.
[90:33.37]How far does the, uh, stack boy reach?
[90:35.29]I don't know.
[90:43.35]Oh, when you dash someone, they drop their tool.
[90:45.19]That's what's happening.
[90:47.21]Did you get any tools stolen?
[90:48.35]Alright, we need the, uh... We need the axe.
[90:56.02]We're here on the right with the cows.
[91:01.93]Okay.
[91:03.55]How do you move the cows out of the way?
[91:04.89]They're just kind of... You can pick them up.
[91:07.27]They're just causing a problem.
[91:15.43]So far, pretty good.
[91:19.87]Me and Dino just got a cross up.
[91:21.01]Did you see that?
[91:21.57]If anyone watching right now, click that and remind.
[91:24.55]We just got crossed up.
[91:25.41]That was crazy.
[91:28.04]I thought he was me and he thought he was him.
[91:31.80]I'm stuck.
[91:36.72]Don't lose me.
[91:46.54]We are down to the final piece.
[91:48.49]Oh, we're stuck back here.
[91:49.67]Alert.
[91:50.11]How do I do the alert button?
[91:51.51]How do I do that?
[91:52.41]I want to do that too.
[91:53.85]Let's alert.
[91:54.33]Great trigger.
[91:58.43]I think I'll be able to save you.
[92:01.54]Yeah, we need to access.
[92:07.84]Also, fire.
[92:09.36]Also, we are... Did we get the key thing?
[92:12.54]Yeah.
[92:13.34]He's got the last thing, yeah.
[92:18.24]Destroy no animals.
[92:19.68]We got it.
[92:22.05]Do we get... Um, by the way... Now we can only do upgrades, so we should probably get the new engine eventually, right?
[92:28.17]We really should do the quest thing that pops up, because I think we just got two bolts for doing that.
[92:34.35]What was the quest?
[92:35.39]It was don't kill any animals, so don't do anything to animals.
[92:38.15]We just got, like, a bolt for that, I think.
[92:39.49]Alright, upgrade the auto-miner.
[92:42.37]Probably crafting speed?
[92:46.42]We have two...
[92:49.88]Oh, the engine lets you have more wagons.
[92:54.22]Should we just wait?
[92:59.67]Yeah.
[93:02.91]Yeah.
[93:03.37]It's all about that auto miner life.
[93:09.51]Key.
[93:09.69]Alright.
[93:12.38]Pick rolls, pick rolls, pick rolls here.
[93:17.52]No.
[93:18.48]Uh, we need stuff.
[93:21.04]Or else we're dead.
[93:21.88]We have a bunch of tracks.
[93:25.88]It's like four.
[93:30.99]There's a lot over here.
[93:33.51]Do you want to put one down?
[93:34.59]No, I got it.
[93:36.17]Automator is on.
[93:39.21]Which way are we going?
[93:39.83]Don't lose these tracks.
[93:54.76]Don't lose me.
[93:55.26]I need more track.
[93:58.84]It's right there.
[94:00.74]Well, someone didn't finish mining that all the way, so we might just lose.
[94:05.04]Track is right here.
[94:11.80]Don't leave that bucket.
[94:13.86]Don't you do it.
[94:14.42]I know you.
[94:15.14]You right there.
[94:15.66]You're going to leave it.
[94:16.22]I know you were.
[94:16.72]Alright.
[94:18.14]We're about to get the ball all stuck.
[94:19.15]We have a little tools up here, right?
[94:24.63]We're about to, uh... We're about to all become stuck.
[94:28.01]Thank God for the auto-miner.
[94:38.91]Auto-miner level two!
[94:40.41]We're going up, right?
[94:41.19]Are we going straight?
[94:42.89]Yeah.
[94:44.31]Uh... Up or right?
[94:47.87]Straight?
[94:56.95]There you go.
[94:59.13]Look at the auto miner leveling the land.
[95:01.43]Oh, it's crazy.
[95:03.89]Kind of stuck on the side.
[95:07.23]Alright, what we got for that pickaxe?
[95:15.90]Here's the end right there.
[95:16.92]So that means there's a secret up top.
[95:18.80]Oh shit, secret.
[95:20.56]Probably.
[95:31.91]wood desperately needed up front uh am I finishing it uh is there any I think I think we're going to go look for the bolt there might be a bolt up there put these over here too so we get extra uh crap
[96:00.15]Is it up there?
[96:00.67]Okay, I think you just gotta finish it.
[96:02.67]Okay.
[96:03.09]Dino already got Bolt.
[96:07.79]Didn't even tell us about the secret.
[96:09.55]Dude, we're gonna be good to go next time.
[96:12.10]It's dark out.
[96:13.34]Should we just get the new engine?
[96:16.74]Yeah.
[96:18.08]New engine?
[96:18.94]Or... I mean, we had so many materials, we just don't have big enough stack sizes.
[96:23.71]Or just wait.
[96:24.21]Auto miner.
[96:25.13]Get auto miner.
[96:25.85]Because we have materials everywhere.
[96:27.39]I don't know if auto mining better is going to help as much as stacking bigger.
[96:33.18]Auto miner.
[96:35.06]Let's do it.
[96:35.42]Alright.
[96:35.96]Auto miner and the upgrade of that thing.
[96:38.56]And then we'll do the, yeah.
[96:42.93]Yeah.
[96:43.11]Then we'll do the train next round.
[96:44.19]Did you just get two auto miner upgrades?
[96:47.89]We got auto miner and auto picker.
[96:49.41]Auto pickup and auto miner.
[96:50.31]Oh.
[96:52.17]Yeah.
[96:52.81]This thing's gonna just chew.
[96:53.69]But we can't hold it.
[96:54.47]We got, like, level one hold resources.
[96:57.71]But it'll just chew through everything.
[96:59.25]I mean, we just need... We just gotta survive.
[97:03.46]Look at all this track we have.
[97:04.36]Are you kidding me?
[97:04.82]This is like we just started on easy mode.
[97:08.52]Because apparently if you take the track off before it ends, it doesn't disappear.
[97:22.29]Make sure you keep the... Don't leave anything.
[97:25.82]Alright.
[97:26.14]Where are we off to?
[97:27.96]The problem is auto miner can reach like twice as far as auto picker.
[97:33.26]That's better.
[97:34.18]Holy shit.
[97:34.80]It is destroying everything.
[97:36.62]So if you upgrade them at the same time, you're not getting max value out of both.
[97:44.40]Watch out for those cows.
[97:45.82]There are cows there.
[97:46.71]You're right.
[97:51.92]Straight across?
[97:52.56]I think straight's the way to go, actually.
[97:56.11]Let's hope so.
[97:58.47]Yeah, he's going up to bolt.
[98:00.41]He's doing bolt.
[98:02.93]He can't get those materials.
[98:03.97]I mean, this is... This is easier.
[98:10.14]Just make sure we get tracks placed down ahead of time because we're about to be... We need wood.
[98:16.78]Wood.
[98:17.58]This station's right here, though!
[98:19.90]What?
[98:20.72]Hey, Dino's not infallible!
[98:22.52]Water.
[98:23.78]Dino's taking us the wrong way, actually, right now.
[98:26.50]I mean, why'd you listen to Sturmmaker's calls?
[98:29.18]Wait, I thought we were going to the right.
[98:31.42]We were.
[98:31.96]Dino moved all the train tracks!
[98:33.40]Oh, it's alright.
[98:34.14]It's okay.
[98:34.38]No, no, no, no.
[98:34.80]This is safe.
[98:35.44]This is fine.
[98:35.79]This is fine.
[98:36.21]Okay, this is what we do.
[98:37.49]I'm on to you.
[98:38.55]I'm on to you.
[98:39.17]Tracks!
[98:39.59]Tracks!
[98:40.03]Tracks!
[98:40.41]Tracks!
[98:40.63]There's a bunch.
[98:41.41]You need tracks!
[98:42.57]Tracks!
[98:42.91]Tracks!
[98:43.21]Track it up!
[98:52.10]Somebody don't touch a cow.
[98:58.57]I'm gonna scream.
[99:03.71]I just want to eat dinner.
[99:04.65]Alright, let me take it down.
[99:11.29]So down, and then I'm gonna start clearing the path here.
[99:22.76]Yeah, we're good.
[99:23.22]We're good.
[99:23.70]We're moving.
[99:24.22]There was some panic there for absolutely no reason.
[99:27.44]Yeah, absolutely none.
[99:29.04]I mean, there was a reason.
[99:30.95]Uh, water?
[99:31.89]Water?
[99:32.19]It was water.
[99:34.33]We got it good.
[99:43.01]Two by two.
[99:43.83]There's so much stone.
[99:45.37]The whole mountain's leveled.
[99:50.29]Yeah, I think we can do next engine now.
[99:57.23]We have so many resources, we're just throwing them in the ocean.
[100:00.24]Well, we need the track builder because it's barely keeping up with the terrain at this point.
[100:07.40]Yeah, we do need the track builder.
[100:08.90]Look at all this.
[100:09.64]We need the track builder and storage.
[100:15.64]No bolts, right?
[100:17.57]It's already been gobbled.
[100:18.87]Let's go.
[100:27.84]track 200 meters we did it is there I think yeah we don't have any bolts we just have to wait till next run yeah just buy an auto miner let's get the uh we've been crafting speed on the wood the planks that's fine do it anyway what'd you just replace I upgraded the crafting of the tracks dino said no we just went against dino's wishes
[100:56.96]Fuck that guy.
[100:57.64]I voted.
[100:57.94]I voted in favor.
[100:59.58]I don't know.
[101:08.03]I know why you just said that.
[101:09.17]Because this guy is keeping you from eating dinner because it means we're continuing.
[101:16.51]I understand how you get it.
[101:17.89]Oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops, oops.
[101:22.28]Alright, we need a lot of stone.
[101:23.88]Alright, we need to go.
[101:26.06]Alright, we need to move now.
[101:27.40]Like, now, now, now, now.
[101:31.55]Get the pickaxe.
[101:33.17]I get the axe, I get the axe, I get the axe.
[101:38.71]No, me.
[101:40.21]We might need to loop the track a bit.
[101:42.67]We should be good.
[101:43.14]We have a ton of track.
[101:44.00]Alright, I'm just on stone, dude.
[102:00.81]We got a lot of- plenty of tra- oh, monsters.
[102:05.85]Are we staying straight?
[102:06.84]Just straight on?
[102:07.48]No reason not to.
[102:09.22]Somebody can get that, uh, we going up?
[102:11.66]We're going up.
[102:12.58]Going up?
[102:13.62]Okay.
[102:14.44]Only one player is allowed to pick up the bucket.
[102:17.88]Where's the fire?
[102:18.38]Where's the, uh, bucket?
[102:19.52]Water bucket.
[102:20.28]You got it?
[102:21.51]Dino has it.
[102:23.93]There's still stone here.
[102:24.81]I can't get through.
[102:26.03]Auto miner will save you eventually.
[102:34.08]Oh yeah, sure, we do have to go up.
[102:37.14]I'm just looping it so we have some time.
[102:40.58]It's gonna shoot for everything.
[102:46.23]We need to go, uh, I think we need to go up.
[102:50.31]Actually, we're fine.
[102:50.93]What do you see?
[102:52.67]Uh, we're going... You got, you just have to go up from here.
[103:04.59]What are we doing?
[103:06.89]What are we doing?
[103:07.49]It placed weird.
[103:08.17]I did not mean to do that.
[103:29.89]Yes, there's so many resources.
[103:32.39]I'm sure that would be a very much not an issue in about five minutes.
[103:38.69]There's too much wood stacked right there.
[103:44.07]You need to pick up that stack of wood.
[103:47.43]Big fat stack of wood.
[103:48.67]Thank you.
[103:50.51]There's so many resources.
[103:55.20]We just built our bridges.
[103:57.64]twice as wide just because we can this is the power of human wealth and influence yeah this is this is just we've grown too fast too greedy gg auto miner that's true I mean we're pretty we still we don't even have enough we can't even do uh this is on fire fuck it end it end it end it end it it's not far
[104:26.14]No, it's not.
[104:27.02]It's good.
[104:27.54]End it!
[104:28.12]End it, end it, end it, end it!
[104:33.15]Oh, we need to get another track up there?
[104:34.79]Oh, shit.
[104:38.09]We don't have enough to do anything.
[104:42.51]But you are doing something.
[104:44.36]Oh, we have three.
[104:45.02]They are just funny.
[104:45.68]They are, yeah.
[104:46.04]Train speed is critical.
[104:47.54]You're stopping me from, like, sleeping and eating.
[104:50.50]And right now, Dino's like, we could have had the engine if you would have just said.
[104:54.14]Train speed is critical.
[104:56.70]What's that mean?
[104:59.06]Produces dynamite.
[105:01.35]Yeah, just wait until next train.
[105:03.31]I'm just reading.
[105:03.93]I just wanted to see what they were.
[105:10.81]Okay.
[105:14.94]Just get everything ready.
[105:20.34]Great.
[105:22.28]Do urges have too much stone and no wood?
[105:26.17]Uh, yeah.
[105:28.21]That's actually happening right now.
[105:31.85]Uh, Autopicker could use wood.
[105:32.97]Uh, we could use wood.
[105:37.33]Alright, bring, uh... We're gonna get stuck!
[105:42.03]We're stuck.
[105:43.49]It's okay, the auto miner's gonna free it up.
[105:49.86]We don't have any wood.
[105:51.22]Who has the axe?
[105:52.40]Who's got the axe?
[105:53.22]I'm using the axe up here on the only trees.
[105:58.00]Uh-oh.
[105:59.07]Uh-oh.
[106:01.67]This is where it gets bad.
[106:05.08]Literally no trees.
[106:07.79]Just bring the wood back.
[106:08.67]There's so much stone all over the ground.
[106:11.75]I'm accidentally picking it up.
[106:17.91]Move, move, move.
[106:22.07]Dark, dark, dark, dark.
[106:23.91]Oh my God.
[106:24.54]Oh, what are you doing?
[106:26.72]Dark, dark, dark, dark.
[106:28.98]Dark, dark, dark.
[106:29.78]It's actually easier to see now than when there's fog.
[106:35.67]I don't even need the axe right now.
[106:39.64]Where's our bucket?
[106:41.26]I got it.
[106:43.82]I'm keeping one eye on that bucket.
[106:45.48]Don't you worry.
[106:55.45]Kill those bandits.
[106:56.09]Fire!
[107:05.35]Alright, I'm gonna mine the stone over here.
[107:14.22]This is the end, right?
[107:17.64]We need a bolt, though!
[107:18.84]We still have... We only have three bolts.
[107:22.65]Did we get them for completing the level?
[107:25.45]Yeah, you get one when you win.
[107:26.49]Alright, well, let's just can it.
[107:28.53]Let's kill it.
[107:32.59]Don't leave.
[107:33.03]Uh, Alex, grab a bucket.
[107:34.05]We're running, too.
[107:35.53]Grab what?
[107:36.25]Bucket.
[107:36.61]Oh, okay.
[107:38.61]Careful.
[107:40.71]Oh.
[107:43.67]Okay, refilling it.
[107:46.65]Alright, let's take the opportunity to stack up a bunch of shit so we don't lose it.
[107:52.47]Let's have, like, a mile of track ready to go.
[107:56.63]Help!
[108:04.98]I wanna be strong.
[108:05.86]Alright, ready?
[108:12.61]Yeah, the Snowpiercer video game.
[108:15.09]It's time for us to get a new train engine.
[108:19.27]Ay-ya-ya, dude.
[108:20.45]I hope that train engine goes even slower.
[108:23.69]It's probably gonna be like twice as fast.
[108:25.01]Train speed, it resets the speed.
[108:28.15]That wasn't really clear until now.
[108:30.24]So what, the train just starts going faster until you upgrade the engine?
[108:32.96]That doesn't really make sense.
[108:34.14]I think maybe it... Train speed is at 0.185.
[108:39.89]New biome?
[108:42.27]New biome.
[108:48.22]There's two bolts above us.
[108:50.04]I'm going to dig up that way.
[108:56.02]We should take the train up, move those tracks so we can go up and get the bolts.
[109:00.90]Uh, it's too late.
[109:04.84]It's too late.
[109:05.46]It's too late.
[109:06.79]Whatever.
[109:07.15]I'm gonna grab- We need the wood to-
[109:26.18]Alright, everyone grab a stack of track and we need to start moving it forward.
[109:33.20]Too much track.
[109:34.96]Too much track.
[109:39.59]Those bolts, though.
[109:40.87]Those bolts look so scrumptious.
[109:43.19]Also, we need to mine up here.
[109:46.75]I got it.
[109:47.05]I'll take it.
[109:50.13]9-0 is on the bolts.
[109:50.73]Don't worry.
[110:00.38]We need the wood chopping up here.
[110:07.22]Can I get one more right here?
[110:09.54]That's fine.
[110:13.08]Get the bolts.
[110:20.22]Did he get them?
[110:23.06]Hey, it's me.
[110:24.22]I'm the mobile point.
[110:26.28]Oh.
[110:28.95]And there's the save point.
[110:29.81]Look at that.
[110:30.25]We're going to have a small problem where if you do not be on the left side of the train, you're going to get stuck.
[110:43.66]There's so many tracks.
[110:45.58]Does the auto miner have...
[110:57.12]We don't need any more pickaxe resources.
[111:06.51]Alright, this is the cactus station?
[111:08.07]This has got to be the new biome.
[111:12.05]It has a save above its head.
[111:18.57]Take everything you can.
[111:24.35]Well, we're locked over here, so...
[111:27.61]Man, we're not even yelling at each other anymore.
[111:29.26]What are you doing?
[111:30.64]What are you, stupid butted idiot?
[111:31.92]We should probably get storage.
[111:36.88]Yeah, we need one of these storage.
[111:41.11]What was the comment from before?
[111:42.49]It was like, oh, they know what they're doing now.
[111:45.03]ResidentSleeper.
[111:46.57]What if it shows you the way and why is it only one?
[112:00.53]I didn't mean to do that.
[112:03.95]I am a one.
[112:04.83]Where are we going with this?
[112:07.57]Oh, we have to go down there because of the... I'm just... Don't... This is not... Don't... It's not my... This is not my thing.
[112:13.15]This is not my bag.
[112:13.93]You know what I mean?
[112:33.11]We added a little extra track there for no reason.
[112:35.35]I actually was doing it right.
[112:38.11]I need to be more assertive.
[112:40.20]This is gonna be a little weird over here.
[112:49.92]Is the auto miner really not mining this?
[112:52.04]Thank you.
[112:53.42]Can you just do it faster?
[112:58.08]Uh, auto miner, like, kinda sucks.
[113:03.05]Don't forget the water.
[113:09.77]Wherever it is.
[113:16.62]Water is at the top left.
[113:19.60]Hey, I almost got the achievement Engineer.
[113:22.26]I've destroyed 701 blocks out of 10,000.
[113:23.84]So good at this game.
[113:34.30]Don't leave that water bucket up there.
[113:37.32]I was almost going to eat dinner, but then it was literally the endless game mode.
[113:44.22]Just one more endless mode.
[113:54.18]Hey, can you come back and mine above it?
[113:57.90]Sorry.
[114:11.38]We're doing so good, guys.
[114:12.50]We're doing so good.
[114:13.34]Yeah, we're doing great in the endless mode.
[114:18.61]Oops.
[114:22.31]Alright.
[114:26.21]What do you need me to do?
[114:26.83]What do you need me to do?
[114:27.95]Track is up.
[114:28.25]We need a wood bridge, or we can just go around.
[114:30.49]Track is up.
[114:30.77]But a wood bridge is just easier.
[114:33.98]We need a wood cutter.
[114:35.22]I will handle that.
[114:37.38]I'll handle that.
[114:38.10]Oh, never mind.
[114:48.61]Is it just me or is this endless?
[114:51.21]Yes.
[114:52.18]That is what you signed up for.
[114:54.14]Can you stop bumping?
[114:56.64]It totally knocks my stuff off.
[114:58.64]I did offer you to order you and all your friends a pizza.
[115:02.98]Order me a pizza.
[115:03.56]What kind of pizza do you want?
[115:08.56]Are you gonna order me a pizza?
[115:12.74]Everyone's gonna have a pizza.
[115:17.91]We have one tree up here that needs to be chopped.
[115:22.49]And he's very close to getting the golden ticket.
[115:24.49]We've got plenty of time.
[115:26.45]We need to chop this cactus.
[115:28.29]We've got time.
[115:34.95]Alright, I will get it.
[115:36.17]Who's got the axe?
[115:38.83]Dino has axe?
[115:40.07]No, Penguin has axe.
[115:42.01]He did.
[115:42.83]He just dropped it.
[115:51.18]Bring it all.
[115:52.18]Alright, stack all the track.
[115:55.50]And put out the fire.
[115:57.96]Where's the bucket?
[116:01.80]Who has the bucket?
[116:03.00]You do.
[116:04.12]Just end it.
[116:06.82]Damn it.
[116:08.44]Oh, it's not going to explode!
[116:10.40]He has to stay.
[116:14.48]Get a pizza.
[116:14.96]Put it on the Jerma985 tab.
[116:20.06]I don't want a pizza, Jerma.
[116:21.80]Order a sandwich from sub sandwich.
[116:25.54]These Jermas suck, don't they?
[116:27.46]I'm on the road to commander.
[116:28.90]What does that mean?
[116:32.48]You don't know what the road to commander is?
[116:35.52]Wait, what about the ghost?
[116:38.84]We're getting stack grabber level three.
[116:42.61]It has extra range and plus one stack size.
[116:51.91]Sub sandwich TM.
[116:55.23]Don't worry, Star.
[116:56.05]It looks like it's getting hard for us.
[116:57.67]And as you know, we're not very good.
[116:59.23]It's really not though.
[117:00.12]It's really not hard at all anymore.
[117:11.82]It's not hard at all.
[117:13.65]I like this music.
[117:23.52]Sounds like a grandfather clock.
[117:25.16]Oh, never mind.
[117:25.68]We need a woodcutter.
[117:28.28]That's a me, I got it.
[117:35.76]Imagine getting a sandwich from Subway.
[117:47.23]I know.
[117:48.15]I try not to.
[117:53.40]do that uh can we just chop these all three of us are like standing here well if you don't chop it you can't go around
[118:12.65]Somebody has to deal with those.
[118:13.91]Somebody has to deal with those beandits.
[118:15.81]We're walking around, each person just standing, holding track, waiting to place them.
[118:21.75]There's an infinite amount of track being created.
[118:24.15]When do I get upgrades to my tools?
[118:25.68]Don't forget those, don't forget that bucket, and don't forget helping me with these beandits.
[118:30.72]Man, fuck your beandits.
[118:33.20]Uh, we have to go north, I think.
[118:42.52]take the bridge I told you not to leave I told you not to leave the bucket and your god you didn't uh you didn't listen to me I mean where's the bucket I haven't I don't care where the bucket is wow I don't care okay I give up you
[119:13.58]Uh, can we get more bridges?
[119:15.98]I'm just on wood duty.
[119:27.65]Uh, this is wrong.
[119:30.22]We gotta daaaag down!
[119:34.38]Go down.
[119:36.34]No, not- okay.
[119:37.64]Well, you just made that harder.
[119:39.18]No, we're good.
[119:40.06]You guys gotta leave space on either side.
[119:43.08]Did you get that achievement?
[119:43.92]What have you done?
[119:46.58]What are you doing?
[119:50.57]What, you want a pizza too?
[119:52.03]We're done.
[119:52.29]Just a second, it's gonna explode.
[119:53.77]I hope so, please explode.
[119:55.57]Have some foresight.
[119:56.15]Etalyx, this is really easy.
[119:57.29]We have 40 tracks.
[120:06.69]Our train is auto-destroying everything.
[120:10.46]It's auto-collecting everything it destroys.
[120:12.50]It's so easy, you won't mind if I go ahead and complete this.
[120:16.34]Please explode, please explode.
[120:23.17]Alright, let's upgrade!
[120:26.95]No, wait, number four.
[120:30.82]Increases the efficiency of neighboring wagons.
[120:33.59]I don't think we need any more efficiency.
[120:35.37]We are as efficient as we can get.
[120:37.49]I think we could be more efficient.
[120:38.51]Why not get another storage cart?
[120:45.49]Please put it in the correct space in your rush.
[120:48.37]Dinosaur's having a fit.
[120:50.27]Oh, it really is a second storage cart.
[120:51.99]No!
[120:52.37]Do this one!
[120:54.71]Don't do it!
[120:55.95]I thought it was an upgrade.
[120:58.61]But it does say new wagon.
[121:02.42]You want to live so much, baby?
[121:03.98]Baby, you should just do it on your own.
[121:05.94]Because I'm fucking... Okay, what is going on with these... Can I... I'm going to address my stream at the moment.
[121:18.51]Co-op game?
[121:20.45]Person you're playing with hates the thing you're doing.
[121:26.17]This has happened again.
[121:28.29]I got guilted by my mom to keep playing the train game.
[121:33.57]Twice.
[121:34.25]I think I got guilted twice.
[121:35.55]I just keep letting... I'm a pushover.
[121:37.51]Mom probably thinks this is really cute and fun.
[121:39.85]How many comments about the dinosaur... How many comments about the dinosaur have you been making?
[121:50.15]What?
[121:51.29]How many comments about, like, oh, this is so cute for the dinosaur do you think is gonna happen?
[121:54.92]I don't know what you're talking about.
[121:59.46]I'm talking about, since you kept playing, we've gotten a new party member who's this awesome, cute dinosaur that is really effective.
[122:08.22]By the way, the reason why this is probably so easy is because we have the dinosaur buddy.
[122:15.46]I mean, yeah, even if he sucked, it would be a 33% increase to efficiency.
[122:19.43]Well, if he sucked really bad... Please explode.
[122:25.99]No one is even using Tool.
[122:29.87]And you're going to tell me, do you think Endless Mode is going to end soon?
[122:32.87]Do you think it's going to change dramatically?
[122:34.57]We went to an entirely different biome.
[122:36.11]Guess what changed?
[122:37.80]Well, we're about to do it again.
[122:38.78]And this has gotten a little more difficult.
[122:42.98]This is the easiest one yet.
[122:44.27]Well, there's no trees, so we need a lot of chops.
[122:49.65]Fast.
[122:50.89]I got it.
[122:52.24]Because we need to build bridges.
[122:54.08]But you don't.
[122:56.96]Now the station looks like a cactus.
[123:14.18]Listen, I'm just very hungry.
[123:16.26]I'm very tired.
[123:19.64]Oh, why don't you just call in... And I want to be able to drown... No!
[123:25.37]I'm on the road to Commander.
[123:27.73]What are you talking about?
[123:29.31]What do you mean the road to Commander?
[123:30.79]What does that mean?
[123:33.33]What game is Commander?
[123:35.63]Are you playing League?
[123:36.85]Do you really not remember that?
[123:38.65]League of Legends?
[123:40.37]Oh, my God.
[123:41.05]Are you playing...
[123:47.53]That was the original YouTube on the actual Machinima channel thing to do.
[123:54.75]To record your Road to Commander in Call of Duty, which was like max level.
[124:00.98]Oh, okay.
[124:02.90]Oh, now it sounds... Now I get it.
[124:04.42]Okay, now I get why he spent this much time saying Road to... Now it makes sense.
[124:08.78]Can you get inside the lines?
[124:10.76]No, I'm going to bed.
[124:13.55]Well, this is tier three.
[124:15.05]New biome incoming.
[124:15.91]It's a snow biome.
[124:17.21]And you, I know you love these snow levels.
[124:19.65]It's just trees.
[124:21.43]He did love the ice in the last game.
[124:23.31]Yeah, I remember that.
[124:27.00]It's the same thing, Ed.
[124:29.86]Okay, I'm desperately trying to fix this.
[124:36.64]Does it go faster over ice?
[124:38.18]I don't know.
[124:40.12]It's the same thing.
[124:41.14]What has that ever stopped you from playing?
[124:42.74]I don't know.
[124:44.57]That was so sad.
[124:48.15]Yeah, there's slippery ice.
[124:53.99]Dino's clearing ice, though.
[124:57.09]You walk slower on it.
[125:02.95]Don't get stuck back here.
[125:03.71]We need that pickaxe.
[125:18.15]Are we going up and right?
[125:19.17]Or which way are we going?
[125:21.45]I think... Just go that way.
[125:24.04]Just go the way you're going.
[125:26.14]Oh, why is it respawning?
[125:30.08]There's snow coming back.
[125:33.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[125:34.95]Where's the... Where's my tools?
[125:38.53]What is going on?
[125:39.79]Who's sprinting?
[125:40.81]Tools!
[125:42.45]Dash really doesn't even make you go faster.
[125:45.17]It does though.
[125:47.88]Alright, turn it down, turn it down here.
[125:54.98]The snow is fucking me up!
[125:57.88]I can't even get rid of the snow!
[125:59.66]I believe that is its intended purpose.
[126:03.67]Oh, I... Fuck.
[126:08.59]There's the bucket, bucket, water bucket.
[126:14.13]what Ster won't talk to me for a month says my mom LOL and she says LOL I don't know what this means call your mother call your mother don't craft any tracks for 40 seconds apparently we did an achievement alright but we do need stone in here like pretty soon I'm just mining it
[126:45.33]There's not much else.
[126:47.03]The stone is not really that, uh... Uh, we're stuck.
[126:49.25]What do you mean we're stuck?
[126:54.56]What do you mean?
[126:55.80]We're, we're dead.
[126:56.82]We lose.
[126:57.06]No, we're not.
[126:57.44]What?
[126:57.72]How?
[126:58.96]We can't get through.
[127:00.54]I can't break that.
[127:01.36]I can't break it.
[127:02.74]Oh, I can, I can, I can, I can.
[127:06.14]Dino, dino, dino, dino, dino, down to me!
[127:08.40]Track, dino!
[127:10.00]Oh no, I'm stuck!
[127:11.44]And then I was the one who saved it of all people.
[127:18.42]I built the back way bridge.
[127:22.58]You had the opportunity to, like, get out of here.
[127:25.34]But you chose.
[127:27.26]You chose to put that track down.
[127:30.69]You could have been like, oh, no, no, no, no.
[127:33.29]Oh, I didn't get there.
[127:34.41]Oh, wow.
[127:35.51]There was nothing that could be done.
[127:37.31]You could have done that.
[127:38.43]That could have been you.
[127:39.33]Alright, which way?
[127:40.89]I don't even know what's mine.
[127:41.81]Straight ahead?
[127:44.03]How do we even get over here?
[127:45.01]We need path.
[127:45.41]We need wood.
[127:49.50]How do we, we can't get up there?
[127:50.58]Oh, right and then down?
[127:52.28]We get the bridge.
[127:52.86]Yeah, we get a bridge.
[127:58.11]The fuck out of my way.
[127:59.71]I don't think we can do this, guys.
[128:04.63]I mean, it's pretty buried in there.
[128:09.01]Is that, we need the axe.
[128:11.81]Pickaxe.
[128:12.53]I don't even know who has it.
[128:13.51]Stop dashing.
[128:14.37]Out of my way.
[128:14.82]I wish.
[128:16.42]I don't think we can do this.
[128:19.28]The music stopped.
[128:20.56]Can it stop for anyone else?
[128:21.60]Ominous much?
[128:26.05]That's just where the... Alright, I got it.
[128:28.05]It's clear.
[128:34.43]It's a save point.
[128:35.91]Look.
[128:38.38]Dude, fuck it.
[128:38.90]Let's just go to the next biome.
[128:40.38]Let's just see it all.
[128:41.86]Cool, let's save and come back tomorrow.
[128:56.20]Alright, doesn't the steam from the engine melt the snow or something?
[129:04.07]No, don't, don't, don't, why would you do that?
[129:06.31]Why would you just do that blindly?
[129:09.07]What?
[129:13.31]You don't want dynamites?
[129:16.75]We got an extra, we got three wagons we could add.
[129:19.35]Nope, let's add like a new engine.
[129:21.79]No, no, no, no!
[129:26.31]Hello?
[129:29.41]I want to see the new bio.
[129:33.25]It's lava.
[129:34.09]He called it.
[129:35.19]He got it.
[129:35.59]Pumpkin scary.
[129:36.05]Wow, I bet.
[129:39.46]Alright, if I get bumped into by a Jerma one more time, I'm going to quit before Star does.
[129:45.30]Isn't that the goal?
[129:52.75]OK, this is different.
[130:00.95]This is slightly different.
[130:02.45]This just turns your head.
[130:05.17]It's a good thing that I... I don't know... have... an IQ... of greater than one.
[130:16.86]And thus I can compensate.
[130:21.84]Uh, I'm pretty sure some root vegetables have IQs of one.
[130:27.35]So, I mean, that's not even accurate.
[130:30.37]But I just mean that I have at least one.
[130:32.79]That's what you need.
[130:33.79]And vegetables could definitely succeed at this.
[130:38.56]That's all I'm saying.
[130:40.20]Yeah, when they got three other dinosaurs carrying, they don't have to show up for work because they ate too much glue.
[130:53.59]Is there even any... How could there be water here?
[130:56.43]In, like, Halloween Hill?
[130:59.76]It's lava.
[131:01.42]It's orange water.
[131:02.92]Uh-oh.
[131:06.24]I can't fit.
[131:07.32]Oh, I wonder if we got dynamite, if we could blow up that rock.
[131:13.05]Maybe.
[131:13.33]Where's Bucket?
[131:18.79]Where's Bucket?
[131:19.85]Where's Bucket?
[131:26.56]I mean, that's all.
[131:27.81]Oh, you can't build bridges.
[131:30.15]Why is it going?
[131:33.73]What?
[131:35.74]I'm dead.
[131:36.50]Why are we dead?
[131:38.92]Why are we parachute?
[131:39.80]What?
[131:45.64]Oh, you're on a... Yeah, we got exploded.
[131:49.60]Is that the Grim Reaper?
[131:52.18]It was weird looking.
[131:54.42]I couldn't tell what it was.
[132:00.11]Well, I was confused, though, because I couldn't build a bridge, but we would need to there.
[132:05.97]Ah, that's so funny.
[132:09.91]I got temporarily cocked.
[132:12.92]Alright, guys, you know, that was a great night.
[132:15.32]I had a lot of fun, but I can't wait to just stuff my face.
[132:19.25]My road to commander continues.
[132:22.23]That was fun.
[132:24.01]Yeah, I like the train game.
[132:25.47]The train game is fun.
[132:26.27]Train game is fun, but train game may be too easy with four people.
[132:30.69]I like the other game, too, but I also would kind of just rather play overcooked, too.
[132:35.40]Yeah, they're almost the same.
[132:36.98]And one has cheeseburgers, right?
[132:40.51]You could set it to hard.
[132:41.97]Yeah, we could have set it to hard.
[132:43.43]Have you played Overcooked?
[132:46.44]Yes.
[132:47.86]Oh.
[132:49.18]I haven't played it.
[132:51.22]It's basically the moving game, but with food.
[132:54.92]I like food.
[132:56.55]You would probably really like that game.
[132:57.91]I feel like you'd be that... Remember House of Dead Ninjas?
[133:03.25]Remember how you got obsessed with that and you got the world record at one point?
[133:07.39]I still have it.
[133:08.34]You still have the world record for Super House of Dead Ninjas.
[133:10.92]I had to get it back at one point, but I have it again now.
[133:13.50]Okay, because I feel like that's one of those games that you would just... Okay, I'm just going to beat every level as fast as I can.
[133:18.62]I don't know.
[133:22.13]And I would have to play the game.
[133:26.55]Well, look at how far we got.
[133:28.33]We did get very far.
[133:30.51]That was just a nice nostalgia watching that.
[133:33.41]That was fun.
[133:36.61]Okay.
[133:36.91]Alright.
[133:37.81]Okay.
[133:39.21]Okay.
[133:40.13]Name reveal.
[133:40.83]We got the name reveal.
[133:43.95]They got out quick.
[133:46.01]Got out real fast.
[133:47.44]Name reveal.
[133:49.46]I'm out.
[133:49.78]I'm out.
[133:50.06]I'm out.
[133:50.30]I'm out.
[133:55.45]Alright, goodbye, Star.
[133:56.57]Thanks for playing.
[133:57.54]Thanks for streaming.
[133:59.38]Thanks for watching Star's chat.
[134:01.38]Oh, he's already gone.
[134:04.46]He's already dead.
[134:09.10]Well, that was fun.
[134:10.42]Yep.
[134:11.72]That was good.
[134:14.07]I'll, uh... I'll let you get to your, uh... I'll let you say bye to your stream, but say bye to mine, and I'll say bye to yours.
[134:22.11]So, uh... Just before we go... Sure.
[134:24.41]Sure.
[134:26.08]I just wanted everybody to know how often and frequently Jerma's been asking me to play Halo recently.
[134:34.77]I was just trying to figure out if... Yeah, I haven't played it, so... I was looking for someone to play it with, and... I was just kind of throwing some lines out to see if anybody had played it yet, so... I mean, it's been like every day, though.
[134:50.21]Well, since about two days ago.
[134:53.25]I wanted to wait a few days after it came out just to check it out.
[135:00.98]Halo with the dino.
[135:04.42]Yeah, come on in, dino.
[135:06.36]Three-person Halo.
[135:11.41]Dude, I don't even know who that person is.
[135:18.77]He left before I could even see his name.
[135:25.69]It's, they're his mom.
[135:29.78]Now that would be very, very interesting.
[135:33.88]Alright.
[135:34.28]Bye, everyone.
[135:35.46]Yeah, thanks a lot for playing, Etalyx.
[135:38.12]If you don't follow Etalyx or Ster, they both stream.
[135:40.92]They both were streaming.
[135:45.88]Take care, Etalyx.
[135:47.53]See you soon.
[135:52.13]I'll play Reach with you, Jeremiah.
[135:53.45]I'm playing it right now.
[135:57.07]Yeah, that's probably what we'll call it there tonight.
[136:00.04]And that will conclude the non-canon co-op week.
[136:05.54]You know what's something I did not think I was ever going to see?
[136:12.56]I looked over here quite a few times.
[136:15.04]And I saw a lot of Nancy Drew demands.
[136:23.95]I'm actually surprised.
[136:26.47]I am very surprised by this.
[136:31.18]But just know that I do have a ton of them.
[136:37.22]So, hey, anytime that there's nothing to do and I'm just like, what do I want to do?
[136:41.63]You might see it again.
[136:42.69]Of course you will, because I bought them.
[136:51.84]But that's what we'll call it tonight.
[136:55.73]And you will see me again this weekend.
[136:59.71]Actually, Otto has to go in for a surgery.
[137:06.44]Otto has surgery.
[137:09.00]He's getting his teeth cleaned.
[137:12.42]And he also is getting a small little growth removed from his knee.
[137:20.17]So, I have to take care of Otto.
[137:29.75]It's very, very small.
[137:34.13]Tooth removal?
[137:34.97]No, no, no.
[137:35.39]Just teeth cleaning.
[137:38.62]I worded that wrong.
[137:39.66]He's getting his teeth cleaned, and then they're going to remove a small growth on his knee.
[137:45.56]There you go.
[137:48.38]Brushing your teeth is not surgery.
[137:51.60]The other one is.
[137:54.51]But you'll see me again.
[137:55.37]I did make a promise that I have to keep.
[137:59.05]And that promise is... On Tuesday, we're going to start with DOS.
[138:04.31]We're going to do another DOS night.
[138:05.91]I did say it.
[138:06.61]I have to at least have my word be real for some of the things I say.
[138:11.19]We're going to go back to DOS on Tuesday.
[138:17.54]Tuesday's DOS.
[138:21.98]There's apparently been a ton of new additions.
[138:25.56]So we're going to check it out.
[138:29.26]Am I leaving?
[138:29.76]Yeah, that's what I'm going to call it.
[138:31.86]That was the plan tonight.
[138:34.02]We had these two games lined up.
[138:39.42]Play Ultima 4.
[138:40.70]Maybe.
[138:45.14]No, we just did Nancy Drew last night.
[138:47.23]Can't do two Nancy Drews in a row.
[138:50.39]Got to space it out a little.
[138:52.85]Uh, that was a lot of fun.
[138:54.75]I think Train Game was... I think they were equally as interesting.
[139:00.05]I think Train Game was a little more engaging, in a way.
[139:03.82]But not really.
[139:04.36]I mean, they're both fun.
[139:07.08]That was Tools Up.
[139:09.74]Which, by the way, if you're gonna buy Tools Up, just be really aware of this.
[139:13.44]There's no online multiplayer.
[139:15.57]You have to do Steam Remote Play.
[139:16.91]That's the only way you get it to work.
[139:18.27]Or Couch Co-op.
[139:19.41]So if you're like, oh, I wanted to play that with one of my friends, you'll get it.
[139:22.59]No, you have to do the Remote Play.
[139:27.04]That was not online.
[139:30.30]This one is on Rail.
[139:31.30]This one is online.
[139:36.16]And it was pretty fun.
[139:38.98]I think this is an early access.
[139:40.12]This just came out in early access something, didn't it?
[139:43.42]It's pretty good.
[139:48.50]But we'll see you in a few days.
[139:51.82]Tuesday to be exact.
[139:55.92]I'm going to go take care of Otto.
[139:59.00]I will give him all of your love and mine.
[140:05.75]This looks like an awesome mobile game.
[140:09.89]Yeah, but isn't an... But hold on.
[140:11.27]But isn't an awesome mobile game just a good game?
[140:14.51]You know?
[140:14.75]That's not... It's alright.
[140:18.81]It was fun.
[140:22.79]No!
[140:23.89]No!
[140:27.51]But thanks again for watching.
[140:29.74]See you Tuesday.
[140:31.55]We'll do the bits.
[140:33.31]I have to get this train sound off my computer.
[140:36.43]Because it's still just here.
[140:41.55]To exit the game.
[140:45.27]Back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back, back.
[140:47.83]Quit.
[140:50.29]It's still playing.
[140:51.29]There we go.
[140:53.53]Alright, let's go back to... Where were we?
[140:56.53]Four or five hours?
[140:57.43]Five hours ago.
[141:08.72]Where were we at?
[141:10.46]I'm actually surprised that Steam Remote Play held up that well.
[141:15.37]I guess you have to have a good connection to the people that you're playing with.
[141:22.79]The three of us are in that southwest sort of location.
[141:28.55]I wonder how bad that would be if I were to play with somebody from the east coast or from Europe.
[141:32.22]It would probably be horrible.
[141:36.06]Maybe.
[141:36.28]I don't know.
[141:36.82]I don't have any experience with it, so...
[141:41.00]But thank you to ExtraCheesy for the 500 bits.
[141:45.52]What you didn't know was that I was the true player one this entire time.
[141:49.26]I was controlling you, controlling the game, controlling their streams.
[141:53.50]Just as right now I am controlling you to read this.
[141:57.03]I am Shrek, and the universe is my onion, not yours.
[142:04.21]I don't understand that last sentence, but thank you for the 500 bits.
[142:12.32]I don't really plan on it.
[142:13.48]And I think... I don't think I have the mental capacity to be able to do it.
[142:16.89]So... I really appreciate that.
[142:18.43]Thank you so much for the $2.50.
[142:40.68]Hopefully, that home life can improve.
[142:45.82]Thanks a lot for the 250.
[142:46.84]Abomination 0.
[142:50.39]Coldest fridge.
[142:52.13]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[142:52.77]Hey, Jerma, I hope you didn't forget what day it is today.
[142:57.67]I did not.
[142:58.65]We'll address that in a few minutes, though.
[143:01.66]We'll address that in a few minutes.
[143:08.42]It's a birthday today.
[143:18.46]How old are you, again?
[143:19.54]How old are you?
[143:29.62]19.
[143:29.64]No, no, no, right.
[143:30.24]Remember, we tried to figure that out.
[143:35.51]It's also my dad's birthday.
[143:37.07]Happy birthday to your dad, too.
[143:44.49]Hope you've been such a good boy this year.
[143:50.39]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[143:53.05]Happy fucking birthday.
[143:57.45]To everybody that has a birthday today.
[144:02.45]Not just one person.
[144:08.90]How many people actually have a birthday here today?
[144:14.28]Let's see, one, two, three, four, five... Quite a lot of us, actually.
[144:23.04]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[144:24.92]I don't forget.
[144:25.71]I mean, I always forget, but as long as I'm reminded every single day.
[144:32.21]I will not forget if each day I'm told not to forget, until the day that it happens.
[144:38.33]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[144:41.80]Appreciate it.
[144:44.55]Your birthday's tomorrow?
[144:45.31]Happy birthday tomorrow.
[144:46.17]I have to be reminded every day.
[144:52.49]That's ADHD.
[144:53.31]Yes, it is.
[144:58.57]DarkSoul250, thanks for the... DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[145:06.67]Even though this week isn't real and we're all in comas, it's been a lot of fun.
[145:10.97]I'll see you all when we wake up.
[145:13.62]Also, my mother legitimately wanted to know why it took you eight hours to beat a Nancy Drew game, by the way.
[145:21.01]Because it was a long-ass game.
[145:31.30]Midnight in Salem.
[145:32.78]It's like a ten-hour game.
[145:37.74]How long to beat Nancy Drew in Salem?
[145:43.42]Nancy Drew Salem.
[145:47.94]What's it called?
[145:50.12]How long is Nancy Drew... No, that's not right.
[145:56.12]Midnight in Salem.
[146:01.71]I'm the only person that's beaten the game, so it's a seven and a half hour game.
[146:13.26]But thank you, Darksova, for the 250.
[146:14.32]Appreciate it.
[146:15.64]Utopia Fox gave 10 community subs.
[146:18.95]I think I missed one of them, but I tried to catch them both.
[146:22.91]That's the one thing when you stream and you play with other people and there's more than one person.
[146:28.31]You have to find that minute where you can just mute everybody.
[146:30.73]And then they go, what are you doing?
[146:32.75]It's like, I'm talking... Hey, pick up.
[146:35.01]What are you doing?
[146:35.57]Are you stupid?
[146:36.75]I'm trying to... So, it's easy to miss some stuff.
[146:39.32]I'm sorry.
[146:40.62]I'm sorry.
[146:42.16]But thank you, KO Legacy and Utopia Fox.
[146:45.96]I think I got them, but I'm just making sure.
[146:49.44]Both of you 10 community subs.
[146:50.46]Appreciate it.
[146:55.08]And we're talking about them.
[146:57.12]Why don't we show them all?
[147:06.87]Thank you so much, everybody, for your subs.
[147:13.64]Really appreciate it.
[147:18.18]Hey, that hurt.
[147:22.91]I'm sorry, dude.
[147:23.57]I'm sorry I didn't mean to bump you.
[147:27.63]But, again, thank you for subbing to this channel, as always.
[147:36.64]We had a couple more bits come in.
[147:38.42]We had TalksRay for $2.50.
[147:40.82]Dingo the Dinosaur for Jerm of Rumble, Jerm of Venus.
[147:43.27]I don't know.
[147:47.55]We'll see.
[147:50.01]We'll see.
[147:53.17]Hey DubskiDude, thanks for the 250.
[147:54.49]Hey Jerma, please don't ban me for this.
[147:57.17]But I had to make a Reddit thread about all the questionable stuff you've been doing lately.
[148:01.56]The thread got 700 upvotes and a few awards.
[148:05.40]So I'm not the only one who is concerned about your behavior.
[148:08.14]I'm not subbed, so I can't link it.
[148:09.92]But just look for the thread titled, What's with all the Jerma controversies?
[148:14.21]I don't want to spread drama.
[148:15.27]I really don't.
[148:16.13]But someone has to say it.
[148:17.31]I hope you can get back on track.
[148:27.46]Hey guys.
[148:27.84]I'm kind of- OH MY GOD!
[148:32.23]This is like- this is a long page!
[148:34.81]Hey guys, I'm kind of new to this community and I was really enjoying watching Jervis' content, but I keep seeing talk of a bunch of controversies he's been in.
[148:41.93]It's weird because Jervis is a likable down-to-Earth guy, so it really doesn't make sense to me.
[148:46.06]I'll list what I've been seeing lately so we can discuss.
[148:50.77]Jerma regularly forces chat to sit through ad breaks.
[148:54.67]I guess this one isn't so bad because he does have to put food on the table, but I'm not sure why Jerma drops so many ad breaks when he already gets a ton of bits and subs.
[149:01.67]He just randomly throws an ad break in whenever he wants.
[149:04.31]I think one time he kept doing them over and over and only stopped when people started leaving.
[149:08.85]He also doesn't... Oh, so now this is real.
[149:13.07]Okay, I get it.
[149:15.50]This is a... Okay.
[149:19.07]Imagine running ads in a row until people left.
[149:21.70]I'm like, when did I do that?
[149:26.04]This is just a... What the fuck?
[149:49.38]Jeremiah encouraging his fans to spam comment threads that he beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[149:55.55]I have first-hand experience seeing people do this on Reddit, YouTube, and Myspace.
[149:59.95]So I know it's likely true.
[150:01.34]Alright, that one's true.
[150:06.36]Because, no, but the only true part about that is I said, if somebody ever says, Jerma died to Pinwheel, which is a lie, then you need to counteract that with, no, he didn't, he beat Dark Souls 3 on stream.
[150:20.81]That's all I said.
[150:21.48]I didn't say to go spam anymore.
[150:22.94]Why would I say that?
[150:24.38]I'm saying, if you see counteract the complete false misinformation...
[150:32.61]Gerber was doing cruel IRL pranks.
[150:34.55]I remember one time Gerber did a video where he bought a bunch of cakes and threw them at random dock workers.
[150:40.60]I guess it was supposed to be a reference to TF2.
[150:42.24]He ended up hitting a guy right in the face and it dazed him to where he couldn't walk straight.
[150:46.29]It was really graphic.
[150:49.64]Jerma talking about his personal fetishes on stream.
[150:53.81]Getting his chest hairs plucked with tweezers and CBT.
[150:57.63]And eating... I personally wasn't around for that stuff, but it sounds like it was gross.
[151:02.19]Some people are just really open.
[151:03.79]Okay.
[151:05.99]Talks shit about his best friends and scams them out of a lot of money.
[151:09.42]I remember Star and Jerma collabs.
[151:13.06]It was really sad to see they had split up, but I didn't know that Jerma had stolen money from him.
[151:19.13]Dude, if you would just... There are so many just lies in this community.
[151:23.69]It's like... There's nobody who can know the truth now.
[151:27.19]There's so many falsehoods.
[151:31.30]Even coming from me, too.
[151:36.84]Jerma harassing a streamer called GrillmasterXBarbecue.
[151:40.32]I only caught the last half of the incident, but Jerma seriously went off the rails and was talking mad shit about him.
[151:44.97]I don't even know who he was until he went apeshit on him.
[151:47.51]I think Twitch admins might have told Jerma to lay off.
[151:51.91]Jerma burning a live wasp on stream.
[151:54.63]That was fake CGI.
[152:01.14]Everyone in the comments is talking about how much of a psycho I am.
[152:05.70]Okay, down in the comments threads, I also find it idiotic that he tried to copyright the planets of the fucking solar system.
[152:13.22]Like, what do you, what?
[152:14.88]Glad that shit got shot down right away, but seriously, what kind of freak thinks he can just copyright planets?
[152:19.88]Delusional much?
[152:21.80]Anyway, his stupid, dupe-spamming fans pretend to be... This... This is like all...
[152:39.39]I heard he also killed Glue Man.
[152:41.11]Glue Man's still alive, so that's not real.
[152:46.17]I love this post.
[152:46.91]I'm calling it now.
[152:47.65]Someone thirsty for drama is going to read this post and take it seriously and then make a YouTube video on it without realizing it's satire.
[153:12.95]This does have 700 upvotes, though.
[153:16.38]Here, if you want to go through... If you want to go through all the horrible things I've done in my career, there it is.
[153:20.96]Eh, that was DubskiDude.
[153:28.54]Thank you, DubskiDude.
[153:31.98]Where's my apology?
[153:32.92]I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[153:50.06]Public apology required now.
[153:53.01]That was not a good apology.
[153:55.47]Okay, sure, guys.
[153:56.81]I'm sorry for the made-up things about me.
[154:02.66]But doesn't that happen in a lot of apologies?
[154:05.32]Guys, I just gotta tell you, I'm sorry, but all these things are made up about me.
[154:10.48]That just happens.
[154:18.50]Guys, just want to hit you with some stuff going on.
[154:22.42]I wanted to say I'm very sorry for the way that you all feel about me and how none of it's real.
[154:27.15]It's not true.
[154:27.73]Sorry.
[154:32.19]Alright.
[154:39.51]Jeremy deserves a second chance.
[154:41.12]Thank you.
[154:42.24]Thank you, Messing Y. Thank you.
[154:51.76]See you guys on Tuesday.
[154:53.36]Thanks for watching the week of non-canon streams.
[155:00.20]Some of those could be retroactively canon, I think.
[155:02.74]Maybe one or two of them.
[155:03.72]What was it?
[155:04.08]Four?
[155:04.50]Last four days in a row?
[155:06.12]Yeah, maybe two of those were canon.
[155:12.83]Good night, guys.
[155:14.93]See you Tuesday.
[155:34.23]I'm not going to turn the stream off yet because it's at 4 hours and 59 minutes.
[155:38.39]And I want this to be a 5 hour stream.
[155:42.20]Because that's going to bug me.
[155:48.46]You're padding your stats by 20, 30 seconds.
[155:52.94]Add it to the list of controversies.
[156:01.49]You're gaming analytics now.
[156:03.23]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[156:06.72]Alright.
[156:07.88]Goodnight, guys.
[156:08.26]See you Tuesday.
[156:24.25]Real quick, C4G, thanks to the 250, the company that made House Flipper and Car Mechanic Simulator appear to be publishing a Jesus game?
[156:35.80]It has a Steam page, but the trailer looks like it's a fake game from a Coke commercial.
[156:41.78]What?
[156:42.06]Okay.
[156:50.04]Alright, goodbye.
[156:52.04]Goodbye.
[156:54.47]Goodbye.
[157:00.75]No, I'm outta here.
[157:09.32]I am Jesus... Am Jesus Christ is the name of the game.
[157:17.78]No, I don't want to show this trailer.
[157:19.68]Because I want to be... I don't want to know anything about this.
[157:23.26]Nope.
[157:23.86]No, no, no, no, no.
[157:24.50]If you want to look, go for it.
[157:25.44]I don't want to.
[157:26.84]Nope.
[157:34.12]I don't want to see a damn thing about this.
[157:45.67]I skipped 10 seconds into that trailer, and I immediately do not want to see anything else.
[157:52.95]No way.
[157:55.33]Whenever that comes out, we're going to have to think about playing that one.
[158:02.96]Thank you, C4G, for the $250.
[158:04.36]And look, it's $501, which is somehow worse than $459.
[158:08.52]God damn it.
[158:13.54]Alright.
[158:14.10]See you Tuesday.
[158:14.54]Goodbye.
[158:25.73]Thank you.
