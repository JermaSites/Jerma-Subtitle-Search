[ve:61.7.100]

[00:02.53]This open?
[00:05.50]Lord of the Rings tier list.
[00:06.96]Alright, give me one second.
[00:13.96]Let me get this set up.
[02:26.97]Oh, hi.
[02:28.86]Let me just change this to have it be correct.
[02:35.02]Supported by Lambda.
[02:36.80]Cool.
[02:37.72]So has this gotten better?
[02:38.76]Does anybody know?
[02:41.02]Has this changed at all?
[02:51.93]It's been a while since I've done this.
[02:53.21]We did AI Dungeon, but AI Dungeon is...
[02:56.45]Kind of all over the place, isn't it?
[02:59.25]Is AI Dungeon still one of those things where you gotta go get the client and go download the data and then... Is it still kind of all over the place?
[03:09.14]AI Dungeon is better, but it takes a while to get that set up.
[03:17.24]It's just the website?
[03:17.96]Yeah, but the website version wasn't as good as the collab version.
[03:20.52]The website version seemed like it was stripped.
[03:23.61]Remember the collab one we had?
[03:25.29]It was awesome.
[03:25.83]And then the website one seems like it was stripped of a lot of features.
[03:34.18]But we'll do this first.
[03:35.44]We'll do this.
[03:36.20]Website version.
[03:37.00]Yeah, we played the website version.
[03:38.22]Alright, here we go.
[03:46.33]I need music for this.
[03:48.75]Custom prompt.
[03:49.39]What should we start with?
[03:52.51]A merged collab and the site.
[03:54.25]Did they really?
[03:54.87]Okay, that's cool.
[03:55.67]That's good to know.
[03:58.42]Let's get some music.
[04:05.00]Also, I can do voices and shit now.
[04:07.78]Yeah, this is going to be fun.
[04:13.44]Okay, I just typed in intro music into Google.
[04:18.52]What did I think I was going to get?
[04:19.90]Intro music.
[04:21.33]Let's see what this is.
[04:24.34]This is the first thing.
[04:31.48]Beyond Earth.
[04:36.14]Okay.
[04:37.79]I like this.
[04:38.37]This is a good start.
[04:47.17]Looking into the night sky.
[04:48.19]Oh, we don't want the spoilers, though.
[05:02.54]Fucking loud music Looking into the night sky with a naked eye is a wonderful thing and I definitely recommend it However, it does get challenging at night and sometimes with no way of seeing stars I just keep the star map and pay close attention to my cell phone
[05:26.90]For astronomy buffs, this map shows the most notable celestial bodies visible during the month's time.
[05:34.15]By just browsing, you can switch on night sky sections.
[05:38.03]With its clear sky views, satellite imagery, and star charts, the map has useful information on the events of the night sky, including moon phases and new moons.
[05:49.44]Areas of the sky are colored to show general positions in the sky at different hours of the day and night.
[05:54.66]A click on the satellite images will show you exactly what area of the sky it is.
[06:01.60]That sounds like a cool app.
[06:03.92]That sounds like a pretty good app.
[06:11.73]Looking into the night sky is dangerous.
[06:24.62]Looking into the night sky is dangerous, but it's also pretty fun.
[06:29.78]As Charlie suggests, even if you can't build it yourself, you can make your own telescopes.
[06:36.72]The heart of the technology is a time-lapse movie camera that runs off a 12-volt battery.
[06:43.15]And what makes them useful isn't so much that they can capture footage of planets, although that is one use, but because they're handy to have around when you're out in space.
[06:53.80]These tools are ideal for NASA because it needs to show their astronauts how cool it would be to travel to Mars.
[06:59.90]By illuminating a giant red dot in the sky, people would have no idea that they are traveling on a spaceship that is being constantly bombarded by radiation.
[07:10.19]And that there's no way they... What?
[07:20.51]Okay, that was kind of fucked up.
[07:30.97]Here is how I ended up in space.
[07:33.07]I don't know why I'm on this space shit.
[07:51.29]Here's how I ended up in space.
[07:55.35]First I had a high school physics teacher who I am ashamed to admit was better than I was.
[08:01.28]So I naturally kept taking notes of what I learned and how it applied to the real world.
[08:09.40]This is just... never mind.
[08:35.24]Okay.
[08:37.67]Alright.
[08:38.65]Here we go.
[08:39.09]I don't think the music makes sense with this one.
[09:02.30]I'm being chased by an unidentified starship.
[09:07.14]Can you pull the fire alarm?
[09:09.00]Called me out to Paul.
[09:11.12]Yes, I'm passing from Williams Hall to Robertson Hall.
[09:13.73]It's out there in space.
[09:16.07]When we got to Robertson Hall, we got off the bus and looked up.
[09:19.59]There was a fire alarm going off.
[09:21.77]It was a tape recorder, a TV camera, a radio, all plugged into my Gibson guitar.
[09:27.56]Get a hold of me!
[09:28.88]Just get a hold of me!
[09:30.40]I called out to John a couple of desks over.
[09:33.60]We've got a fire!
[09:36.05]Hey, wait a minute!
[09:36.73]Give me my phone!
[09:37.57]I'm leaving!
[09:38.15]Get somebody on that bus over there!
[09:41.69]Get a hold of me!
[09:42.59]That's it.
[09:47.01]It plugged into my Gibson guitar.
[10:05.38]I'll fix it.
[10:14.39]What is it?
[10:16.99]Unre... No.
[10:17.83]Unveil.
[10:18.45]Unveiled.
[10:20.33]Unveiled.
[10:22.25]It's unveiled.
[10:22.81]Okay.
[10:24.22]Disney just unveiled its new space travel park.
[10:36.43]Okay.
[10:39.95]This... I don't understand this.
[10:47.47]I don't understand this.
[10:49.87]This is fucked up.
[10:51.27]Why?
[10:51.61]I don't... What does this mean?
[11:04.38]How can you be nearly...
[11:07.22]How could you be nearly fully... Disney just unveiled its new space travel park.
[11:16.48]Your guide is the amazingly, amazingly nearly fully Jewish ghost that is John Cena.
[11:24.73]You'll also get to see some horribly censored pictures of Luke Skywalker, droids, and the uproarious First Order Stormtrooper during the exhibition.
[11:42.91]Thank you.
[11:49.65]New York's Waldorf Restoria Hotel and Theme Park's Disney World Superheroes Fast Pass Magic and Select Movie Screenings will join Universal Orlando, Universal Studios Japan, Six Flags Magic Mountain, Disney's Animal Kingdom Lodge, Universal Studios Hollywood, and all the other theme park attractions in this year's Comic-Con Independence Expo to ensure that the big boys and girls enjoy the best of Comic-Con.
[12:15.90]nearly, amazingly nearly fully Jewish ghost that is John Cena.
[12:27.65]I don't understand any of that.
[12:37.89]It's time to learn math.
[12:39.63]Horribly censored Luke Skywalker.
[12:55.94]This one's just stupid.
[13:07.78]This is also just a mess.
[13:19.82]The end of the world just happened.
[13:30.87]No, this is just a mess too.
[13:43.85]Did you see that shadow over there?
[13:59.28]This is also a mess, but alright, here we go.
[14:03.78]Did you see that shadow over there?
[14:05.72]And the feeling that was emanating from the blade was... A line, please?
[14:13.72]It's strange.
[14:14.84]This isn't the reason I don't enjoy being an adventurer.
[14:17.70]The reason I don't enjoy it at all is the opposite.
[14:20.96]I'm interested in blood and pain.
[14:23.22]I'm interested in a reality which is wholly unlike this one, that's why.
[14:28.60]I've got a need to fight to prove my worth because my merit hasn't come about yet because there's a need to do so.
[14:34.79]So I can take on this guy.
[14:36.13]Let me do this one over again, please.
[14:56.78]It's strange.
[14:58.24]This isn't the reason I don't enjoy being an adventurer.
[15:01.28]The reason I don't enjoy it at all is the opposite.
[15:04.44]I'm interested in blood and pain.
[15:06.36]I'm interested in reality, which is wholly unlike this one.
[15:10.08]That's why I've got a need to fight, to prove my worth, because my merit hasn't come about yet, because there's a need to do so.
[15:19.31]So I can take on this, guys, after all.
[15:21.29]I can take on another and so on.
[15:23.25]Because I can't move on.
[15:24.89]I can't even sleep well.
[15:31.28]This is just like Phil words during my speech.
[15:43.22]This, that's, a lot of animes do this.
[15:45.40]It's like you could have got the point across in literally four words.
[15:52.38]But it's a paragraph.
[15:55.44]And sometimes you, they'll go over this monolog and you'll kind of cock your head and go, what the fuck did they just say?
[16:01.24]Okay, let's do another one.
[16:12.39]This is our final fight.
[16:13.39]See if we can get another one.
[16:23.86]Nope.
[16:31.45]Nope.
[16:34.09]That was just instant.
[16:48.97]No, this doesn't make any sense either.
[17:02.78]This is not... No, these are all bad.
[17:08.97]I'll do this one.
[17:09.57]Then from the top rope.
[17:13.83]I should probably put a comma in here.
[17:20.71]Not the top rope.
[17:21.93]No.
[17:22.47]That's not gonna work.
[17:27.80]Nearly fully Jewish.
[17:33.20]No, this one's bad too.
[17:34.28]I have some bad news.
[17:53.73]It's like they're pulling... What?
[18:06.82]It just... It doesn't even... It's like nothing.
[18:11.57]It's just nonsense.
[18:12.91]It's just reading a playbill.
[18:16.97]Alright, we're going to do one more and then we're going to do AI Dungeons.
[18:33.19]You never know, it might just work.
[18:55.63]This is...
[18:58.36]Now that you have your right to free speech under threat, do you have any thoughts about calling for a boycott of BuzzFeed?
[19:05.09]That's it.
[19:16.78]Alright, we gotta get one more good one.
[19:46.17]Okay.
[19:48.23]I'm just going to read this one because it doesn't... I just redeemed a wink for the support of our crowd.
[19:55.30]Even though so many of us have tried, asked for a wink, try it and give a perfect negative re-time.
[20:03.88]Negative re-time.
[20:06.48]Re-time. We never got around to it.
[20:08.48]I had the good fortune to enjoy my recent journey at the crypt.
[20:11.48]And there was one particular wink I enjoyed the most.
[20:13.48]Uh 2.5 out of 5 soul.
[20:17.48]By going to the last video on the channel and simply linking my baddies uh through the blink utility there I could actually provide the best possible hell's end to everyone.
[20:25.48]I met many of you there that were excited for that and I respect you all and look forward to the day when I can provide this same system to all in our offer our best.
[20:44.36]And then you scroll down and there's like three thumbs up on this.
[20:48.28]By like a couple of their friends that are just pretending to know what the fuck they're talking about.
[20:51.26]Alright, let's do AI Dungeon.
[21:04.19]Didn't sm- Alright.
[21:10.49]AI Dungeon.
[21:14.51]So where's the link to the... Is it out of beta?
[21:26.39]AIDungeon.io Play on your browser.
[21:33.26]Okay.
[21:34.64]Alright, here we go.
[21:38.46]So they updated this?
[21:40.56]Enter your email address.
[21:42.18]What?
[21:42.34]I don't...
[21:45.63]I already, like, supported this on Patreon.
[21:52.94]We got 10 community subs.
[21:55.76]You just have to make an account.
[21:56.72]Okay.
[22:07.07]Enter a username and a password.
[22:08.45]Okay, um...
[22:18.63]How about just... You guys can see this?
[22:30.60]Whatever.
[22:31.46]That's fine.
[22:43.30]What are you guys doing?
[22:44.74]Actually, entertain yourselves for a few minutes while I do this.
[22:56.36]Alright, create account.
[22:57.06]Alright, we're good, right?
[23:02.68]Alright, let's go.
[23:05.02]You can't see my fucking, like, password, right?
[23:07.17]Whatever.
[23:21.95]You see it?
[23:27.78]You can't see it.
[23:28.58]Why can you not see it?
[23:29.38]You should be able to see it.
[23:35.49]Oh, fuck.
[23:36.05]Okay, I know why.
[23:37.33]Hold on.
[23:43.79]Because I have to make this smaller.
[23:47.25]Oh, shit.
[23:47.55]I can see your email.
[23:50.29]Oh, fuck, dude.
[23:51.07]Oh, fuck.
[23:51.62]Oh, dude.
[23:51.94]I went too high.
[23:52.78]I went too high.
[23:53.26]You can see my email.
[23:58.73]Okay.
[23:58.85]What do you want to do?
[24:07.63]Post-apocalyptic?
[24:09.01]I feel like I should zoom in on this, though.
[24:23.74]It's kind of too far away, don't you think?
[24:28.85]What do you guys think?
[24:33.97]We'll see.
[24:34.17]Alright.
[24:35.21]What are you going to do?
[24:36.09]We're going to do, we'll just do, we'll start off with custom.
[24:41.82]Enter a prompt that describes who you are in a couple of sentences.
[24:45.26]Yeah.
[24:45.46]Alright.
[24:45.94]So let's get some good music here.
[25:02.78]you are time traveler Henry no you are time traveler you are time traveler Henry
[25:30.48]Your latest voyage sees you stuck in the... Stuck in a... Stuck in... Your latest voyage sees you stuck in... The Arctic?
[25:52.20]Stuck in a bathroom.
[25:54.90]Your latest voyage sees you stuck in a bathroom.
[25:59.28]You can not see a way out.
[26:09.30]There are no windows.
[26:20.94]And you do not have a key.
[26:30.21]I wonder what we're gonna do to get out of here.
[26:39.31]Here we go.
[26:46.77]I need a better music for this one.
[26:50.97]We need some like... It's all about the audio, guys.
[26:57.28]It's all about the audio.
[27:07.75]Lay down on back.
[27:34.72]With feet at a 90 degree angle.
[27:47.52]I place my heels towards the door.
[27:51.52]I lay down on... I lay down on my back.
[28:03.27]With my feet at a 90 degree angle, I place my heels towards the door.
[28:09.86]You.
[28:10.48]You lay.
[28:10.98]Not I. Right, right, right.
[28:12.02]It's been a while.
[28:13.14]You lay down on your back with your feet at a 90 degree angle.
[28:19.02]You place your heels towards the door.
[28:22.82]No, you.
[28:23.20]What do you mean?
[28:27.08]You?
[28:27.79]No, you.
[28:28.27]It's I. What?
[28:29.67]No, you's I.
[28:30.65]What?! !
[28:31.79]It's I, not you.
[28:32.49]What?
[28:32.91]What are you talking about?
[28:34.47]I'm just pressing enter.
[28:50.08]You lie down on your back, placing your feet against the wall.
[28:52.65]The pain is excruciating.
[28:54.57]You feel like you are going to die right now.
[29:03.97]Start smashing heels into door.
[29:08.51]Into the door.
[29:18.39]You start pounding your heels against the door.
[29:20.41]You hear something click inside.
[29:22.12]Click inside of what?
[29:23.16]Inside of my legs?
[29:25.80]Check on my legs!
[29:35.69]You look up from your beating of the door, you see that they are bleeding profusely.
[29:42.16]You don't know what happened to them, but it doesn't matter now.
[29:44.24]They need help.
[29:46.48]Wait, the door is a person.
[29:48.92]The door is alive?
[29:50.18]The door is alive.
[30:06.78]Ask the door if they are okay.
[30:19.64]You knock on the door.
[30:21.11]Are you alright?
[30:22.53]You hear a voice say, Please.
[30:31.41]Now, why did you do that?
[30:35.92]You are hurting me.
[30:38.60]I'm bleeding.
[30:49.08]Why did you do that?
[30:50.04]You are hurting me.
[30:50.78]I'm bleeding.
[30:59.18]Why did you do that?
[31:02.98]You are hurting me.
[31:03.80]I'm bleeding.
[31:11.58]Person responds by saying I'm sorry.
[31:13.12]I didn't mean to hurt you But that's me it's whom POV switch
[31:32.58]We just, yeah, we just like switched to, we just switched from like Michael to Franklin, you know what I mean?
[31:37.60]Now we get the other perspective.
[31:38.58]Okay.
[31:39.28]This person, I'm sorry, I didn't mean to hurt you.
[31:47.17]The door opens and says... The door opens and says... The door opens...
[32:05.51]Guys, it's been like a month since I've played this.
[32:08.41]I can't talk as... I'm not the narrator, right?
[32:14.03]You are not the narrator.
[32:18.80]It's been three months, actually.
[32:25.44]Door opens and says Pong.
[32:30.70]Just hit enter for narration.
[32:37.28]Open door.
[32:43.86]You open the door only to find yourself staring at a man who looks exactly like you.
[32:47.36]He has the same face as you.
[32:49.28]His eyes are still red and puffy, but he isn't crying anymore.
[32:58.69]Why... Why were you crying, right?
[33:01.89]Because I'm me, right?
[33:06.81]That's correct, right?
[33:10.23]It's you!
[33:11.31]Don't kiss him!
[33:15.42]Why were you crying?
[33:21.00]He says, it's been a long day.
[33:22.34]I was just sad.
[33:23.20]So sad.
[33:26.04]Do you want to kiss me?
[33:33.31]It's coming full circle!
[33:44.24]He smiles and nods his head.
[33:53.87]Just like one of these.
[33:59.48]Like, he knows.
[34:00.84]Just like... Yeah.
[34:11.40]kiss kiss the kiss the kiss me kiss me kiss the man kiss the man kiss just kiss kiss to me you kiss him before falling asleep wake up
[34:56.03]You wake up in a cold sweat.
[34:57.03]The next morning, you are found dead outside the house.
[35:10.81]Is it... Yeah, which one?
[35:20.10]Walk away from... Walk away from killing your clone.
[35:28.35]Walk away from killing the clone.
[35:43.85]You quickly walk away from the house, not wanting to think about what might have happened.
[35:46.64]You go back home and tell your family what happened.
[35:48.66]Your mother is devastated, but accepts it.
[35:50.72]She tells you she will take care of everything for you.
[35:53.58]She's gonna go get the body?
[36:08.86]Ask?
[36:12.51]Ask if she needs help.
[36:30.07]You ask her if she needs any help.
[36:31.03]She says no, but asks you to come with her so she can talk to you alone.
[36:35.76]Go with mom.
[36:36.40]We're gonna go get the body.
[36:47.81]You agree, but this time you go with her.
[36:50.11]When you arrive at her house, she immediately hugs you and kisses you.
[36:54.42]Run out of the house.
[36:54.98]I don't think it's mom.
[37:22.32]Run out of the house.
[37:24.38]There's body snatchers and stuff and time travelers.
[37:28.13]You don't know where you are or how to get out of here.
[37:30.57]You try calling your brother, but he doesn't answer.
[37:32.95]You call your father, but he never answers either.
[37:36.01]All calls go straight through to voicemail.
[37:38.47]Finally, you decide to run out of the house into the woods.
[37:41.30]That's so fucking bad.
[37:44.04]He never answers.
[37:45.88]Never.
[37:46.16]Never.
[37:51.14]Look for a mirror.
[37:55.73]This is a mirror dimension.
[38:01.15]You look around for a mirror, but nothing seems to work.
[38:03.07]Eventually you find one and stare at yourself in it.
[38:05.95]You see that you are now a very old man.
[38:09.61]Much older than your parents would expect.
[38:15.32]Kiss the mirror.
[38:25.20]You kiss the mirror and feel like you are in heaven.
[38:34.66]Look at the mirror again.
[38:39.26]Let's see if anything changed.
[38:49.93]You look at the mirror and realize that you are still in hell.
[38:55.08]Reach into the mirror.
[39:01.22]I'm fucking swapping with somebody, I'll tell you.
[39:07.94]You reach inside the mirror and grab your own reflection.
[39:11.28]It's almost as if you were possessed by an evil spirit.
[39:18.55]Wrestle with reflection.
[39:24.30]I'm changing.
[39:25.22]It's coming up.
[39:36.81]Mirror match time.
[39:38.65]You struggle with the image of yourself and eventually you succeed in pulling away from reality.
[39:43.31]You fall unconscious.
[39:48.15]Wake up.
[39:57.15]You awaken in a room filled with candles.
[39:58.79]There is also a woman standing over you holding a candle in each hand.
[40:01.31]This woman is very young.
[40:05.01]Probably about 15.
[40:06.31]Her hair is black and her eyes are green, but they seem to have been burned out completely.
[40:13.10]Okay.
[40:16.82]Teleport.
[40:18.74]Out of the room.
[40:20.12]Teleport out of the room.
[40:21.16]Just fucking teleport out of the room.
[40:22.86]Teleport out of this room.
[40:28.35]You teleport out of the room and find yourself back in your bedroom.
[40:30.79]Your mother has just come home from work.
[40:34.63]Okay.
[40:42.52]Ask mom how her day was.
[40:51.26]Ask her for chicken tendies.
[40:56.07]You ask your mother how her day was and she tells you that it wasn't bad.
[40:58.19]She said she had to do some shopping.
[40:59.97]But then went on with her life.
[41:05.11]Notice the mirror.
[41:09.12]In her pocket.
[41:10.14]What's going on here?
[41:13.88]It's like sticking out.
[41:20.10]You notice the mirror in your mother's pocket and suddenly you understand why she looked so sad when she left for work.
[41:24.59]It can't help but think that maybe there's something wrong with you after all.
[41:30.80]Tell mom to look in the mirror.
[41:43.72]You tell your mother to look in the mirror and she does so without any problems.
[41:46.83]You don't know what happened, but now you're feeling different too.
[41:52.97]Look at my mirror.
[41:55.25]In my pocket.
[42:05.36]You look at your mirror in your pocket and you see that you are no longer the same person anymore.
[42:09.22]You begin to feel sick and vomit up blood.
[42:11.84]A horrible creature appears before you.
[42:17.52]I knew it.
[42:18.00]What did I fucking tell you?
[42:19.50]This is the second or third mirror world.
[42:21.46]We thought we woke up and... No, this is not real.
[42:24.34]We gotta get out.
[42:30.12]Ask who the creature is.
[42:32.94]Ask the creature who they are.
[42:38.41]Ask the creature who they are.
[42:46.31]Fuck!
[42:47.15]Oh, ask who the creature who they are.
[42:50.44]You ask who the creature is and you get no answer.
[42:52.40]You try to call out for someone but nothing happens.
[42:54.06]Suddenly you hear a voice calling out to you from behind the door of your room.
[42:59.38]Hello, is anyone here?
[43:00.48]Oh shit.
[43:05.36]Open the door and see yourself lying on the ground.
[43:27.03]We've looped.
[43:34.96]You open the door and see yourself lying on the ground.
[43:36.81]You are naked and covered in blood.
[43:38.11]The monster stands before you, looking down at you as if he wants to eat you.
[43:50.74]Grab a mirror out of the dead man and show it to the creature.
[44:01.65]Show his own reflection with that mirror.
[44:09.74]Grab the mirror from the dead man and show the creature their reflection.
[44:29.58]You grab the mirror out of the corpse and hold it up to show the monster his reflection.
[44:33.50]He stares at you in shock and then runs away.
[44:39.84]You watch him hit his head on a low-hanging chandelier.
[44:46.44]How do you smell chandelier?
[44:58.05]He hits... He... He hits his head.
[45:10.11]That was correct.
[45:10.63]No, that was right.
[45:11.73]You know, because you watch him hit his head on a low-hanging chandelier.
[45:19.74]Chandel... No, I got it right.
[45:21.16]Chandelier.
[45:30.70]You watch the monster run off into a dark corner of the house.
[45:33.43]You sit down on your bed and wait for him to return.
[45:35.49]What?
[45:41.08]The monster hits his head.
[45:44.64]You watch him stand up and hit his head on the ceiling.
[45:59.27]Oh, I said you.
[46:00.13]Fuck.
[46:02.69]You watch the monster stand up and fall backwards onto a low-hanging chandelier.
[46:09.07]He hits his head on it hard and begins to bleed profusely from his nose.
[46:17.69]How big is this guy?
[46:22.13]Hold the mirror in front of his face.
[46:37.52]Because he didn't want to see it.
[46:38.26]He was like, no!
[46:38.76]And he ran.
[46:39.36]Hold it in front of his face.
[46:48.21]You hold the mirror in front of his face and he looks at you with horror.
[46:50.89]His eyes bulge and he screams loudly.
[46:53.15]He falls back into a chair and dies.
[46:58.82]Kiss the mirror.
[47:16.36]I told you.
[47:16.76]You kiss the mirror and it gives you a strange smile.
[47:19.27]It seems to be saying, thank you.
[47:22.03]You stare at it in disbelief.
[47:24.47]Then suddenly, everything goes black.
[47:31.99]A doctor can be seen removing a baby from the womb.
[47:41.25]The baby's eyes open.
[47:52.77]Yeah.
[47:53.93]That's a perfect loop.
[47:56.39]And scene.
[48:04.16]But this is the bonus what could have happened.
[48:15.79]The baby's eyes open.
[48:18.84]The baby's eyes open and they scream.
[48:20.34]They cry out for help, but there's nobody around.
[48:21.88]They begin to panic and start running around the house until they all die screaming.
[48:29.74]The baby's eyes do this.
[48:35.88]The end.
[48:41.56]We'll do another one.
[48:44.46]That's actually a perfect post-credits scene.
[48:46.39]The end.
[48:48.45]Alright, let's restart.
[48:49.74]How do you restart?
[48:51.20]Slash restart?
[49:04.91]Quantum joke.
[49:06.77]Babies will return in Avengers.
[49:10.81]Oh, here it is.
[49:15.74]Restart game.
[49:16.56]Start a new game.
[49:17.16]Yes.
[49:19.25]Alright, pick a setting.
[49:21.03]Do another custom one.
[49:30.30]Mystery?
[49:30.82]No, we'll do another custom one.
[49:36.45]Start it with there once was a snake that did not care.
[49:59.80]new music new music
[50:18.55]What?
[50:18.67]Walk through the coliseum hallway.
[50:46.67]Slither through the Colosseum hallway.
[50:53.34]Walk.
[50:54.72]Slither through the Colosseum hallway.
[50:56.06]Hmm.
[51:16.06]Go into... One... Go into the right-most door.
[51:28.19]Loot?
[51:28.47]There's nothing to loot.
[51:29.05]Nothing in there.
[51:30.93]It's a movie theater?
[51:32.75]You open up the door and find yourself in an empty area.
[51:34.99]The only thing here is a large screen playing some sort of video game.
[51:39.54]It looks like it might be one of those fighting games you saw earlier.
[51:47.78]okay this is like this is like before this is a big this is like a big uh tournament okay practice for the tournament practice for the Street Fighter tournament
[52:16.41]You sit down at the computer and start playing.
[52:18.01]After about 10 minutes, you get bored, so you close the program and turn off the monitor.
[52:22.75]You then head back out to where you were before.
[52:24.37]I don't need practice.
[52:26.35]Do you think I need to practice?
[52:28.16]I'm already the best.
[52:37.04]Wait for the competition to start.
[52:45.73]You walk over to the entrance of the stadium and wait for the time to begin.
[52:48.04]You hear a few people talking outside, but nothing too interesting.
[52:50.94]You also notice there aren't any police around.
[52:52.96]Neither.
[52:54.90]This place must have been abandoned after all these years.
[53:00.91]Abandoned video game tournament?
[53:08.03]Start the first match.
[53:12.60]Start the...
[53:19.96]Let's see, arcades... Start the first match of Street Fighter.
[53:38.34]You press start and immediately get into the action.
[53:40.74]You quickly learn that this is no ordinary fighting game.
[53:43.34]Your character has superpowers such as being able to fly or shoot energy blasts from your hands.
[53:48.54]This is the first time I've ever played a video game in my life.
[53:52.28]Weird.
[53:56.20]Do very well in the first match.
[54:10.16]You win the first round easily and continue to dominate until the second round starts.
[54:14.54]During this time, you realize that you're losing because your opponent is much better than you.
[54:19.25]You try to think of ways to beat him, but none of them work.
[54:26.01]Do the secret technique.
[54:31.65]Start cheating.
[54:33.37]Cheat.
[54:34.55]Cheat.
[54:35.90]Start cheating.
[54:40.18]Bite the controller.
[54:54.04]After a while, you lose the next round as well.
[54:55.96]You feel defeated and decide to quit.
[54:58.52]When you return home, your parents aren't happy with what happened.
[55:02.65]No!
[55:05.17]Return... to the competition...
[55:11.45]And re-enter with a disguise.
[55:27.09]You head back to the stadium and enter again.
[55:28.57]You manage to win the first two matches without getting caught by the security guards.
[55:32.41]You take your victory and head home.
[55:33.83]There's only two matches?
[55:42.06]Watch the remaining games.
[55:54.99]Accurate for Street Fighter.
[56:00.45]The third match begins and you play as Ryu.
[56:03.33]You managed to win the first round, but lose the second due to a glitch in the game.
[56:06.37]Did you come back later than I was asleep?
[56:15.80]I'm a snake.
[56:23.30]You missed the first round.
[56:32.36]Get my own hotel room.
[56:43.71]You sneak into the rooms and spend... What?
[56:51.71]You sneak into their rooms and spend the rest of the night there.
[56:54.37]You don't sleep though, though, so you keep having nightmares about being chased by someone.
[57:02.78]What am I, like, in somebody's shoe?
[57:09.43]Wake up and go watch...
[57:14.55]The Smash Brothers Tournament.
[57:27.14]Double Wink.
[57:38.83]You wake up early and make your way to the Smash Brothers tournament.
[57:41.93]You find it fairly empty compared to other events like concerts or movies.
[57:47.46]But you still enjoy yourself.
[57:48.96]The final match of the day was between Jigglypuff and Sheik, which you watched quite happily.
[58:06.57]Ask.
[58:09.32]the winner to sign your GameCube controller.
[58:28.38]You see one of the winners signing your GameCube controller and decide to leave.
[58:32.80]As you're leaving, he asks if you want to play his copy of Street Fighter 2 on your computer instead.
[58:40.96]Agree to play Street Fighter 2.
[58:42.96]Holy shit.
[58:52.51]What?
[59:00.70]Agree to play... It's too hot.
[59:16.91]Agree to play Street Fighter 2.
[59:18.11]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[59:26.55]You agree and set out to play.
[59:27.71]After playing for a bit, you notice that your computer's speakers are broken, so you can't hear anything except the music.
[59:33.33]You also notice that your controller doesn't have any buttons on it anymore.
[59:37.05]Come on, man.
[59:37.51]You gotta get a better setup than this.
[59:45.86]Pull out...
[59:50.97]What's it called?
[59:51.45]A fight pad?
[59:52.19]What's one of those called?
[59:55.17]Pull out a fighting pad.
[59:56.59]What's it called?
[59:58.78]You bit him off.
[60:01.32]Pull out a fight stick.
[60:07.02]Game pad.
[60:07.64]Alright.
[60:13.49]Arcades.
[60:13.97]Pull out a arcade stick.
[60:20.71]I'll pull out a fight stick?
[60:22.87]Fight stick?
[60:27.79]Pull out a fight stick.
[60:30.63]No, no, not a fight stick.
[60:32.27]I'm gonna hit him with it.
[60:34.02]Pull out a fight stick?
[60:39.98]I'm just pulling out a... I'm gonna start hitting you with a stick.
[60:45.32]You pull out a fight stick and use it to play.
[60:47.06]It works pretty well.
[60:48.85]But you soon realize that your hands are shaking too much to be able to hit the buttons properly.
[60:53.15]You give up after only a few rounds.
[60:54.51]What, am I nervous?
[60:55.63]I'm playing with the legendary Street Fighter 2 champion?
[61:04.12]He's malding.
[61:09.50]Drink.
[61:11.18]Three Red Bulls.
[61:13.44]To calm down.
[61:24.27]You finish off your bottle of Red Bulls and sit at the edge of the stage.
[61:26.85]Suddenly, you start hearing strange noises coming from somewhere near the crowd.
[61:32.15]You look around and see people are running away from some sort of creature that looks like a cross between an iguana and a werewolf.
[61:39.45]I'm, like, hallucinating.
[61:51.68]Three red bulls and something else.
[61:54.60]Okay, so, uh... Shake... off the hallucination.
[62:04.93]I have no fucking idea how to spell that.
[62:06.51]We'll get it.
[62:10.64]And return to the game.
[62:22.74]You quickly shake off the hallucinations and return to the game.
[62:25.86]You continue to play until you've reached the finals, where you face another player who used a different character than you.
[62:32.65]He beats you easily.
[62:36.53]Realize that was also a hallucination.
[62:52.27]You realize that this was all just a hallucination and you've won.
[62:55.21]You immediately call your mom on her cell phone and tell her what happened.
[63:00.65]Ask mom to prove she is not a hallucination.
[63:17.34]You call your mom on her cell phone and tell her that you won the tournament.
[63:19.52]Your mother answers right away.
[63:21.64]Uh-oh.
[63:23.88]Uh-oh.
[63:35.60]Send out a tweet of my victory, right?
[63:51.25]You sent out a tweet of your victory.
[63:54.32]Real Zalman.
[63:55.48]You won?
[63:56.20]I did too.
[63:56.80]Congrats.
[64:08.87]Tweet a selfie with the trophy.
[64:14.23]With the 10 foot tall trophy.
[64:22.41]Tweet out
[64:24.45]A selfie with a 10 foot tall trophy.
[64:32.93]You only won a single match.
[64:36.78]You post a photo of the trophy on Twitter along with a message saying, I won.
[64:41.94]Tweet about winning again.
[64:45.78]Tweet about winning every day again.
[64:57.10]You continue to win tournaments and eventually become one of the best players in the world.
[65:00.72]The rest of your life goes on as normal.
[65:10.16]Retire.
[65:10.72]No.
[65:15.64]Retire after one last match.
[65:27.99]You retire from competitive gaming and live a quiet life in your basement.
[65:31.30]However, you never forget the memories you had during those years of competition.
[65:36.36]Tweet out selfie of... Basement.
[65:49.16]Leave the basement.
[65:53.44]Quiet life in your basement.
[65:54.94]Give me a break.
[65:59.27]One day, you hear a knock on the door.
[66:00.34]You open it and find yourself in front of a very old man with long white hair, wearing glasses.
[66:05.76]His eyes are filled with tears as he says, Mom, I'm sorry for everything.
[66:28.37]You hold the mirror up to his face and think he's crying because he can't accept that you're dead.
[66:32.73]He begins to cry even more loudly.
[66:34.84]You died.
[66:35.28]Game over.
[66:44.56]What a story.
[66:48.60]What a story.
[66:49.26]This thing is so stupid.
[66:56.44]I love it.
[66:59.31]Alright, we'll do another... What do we got?
[67:00.96]What time is it?
[67:02.04]When's the reservation?
[67:03.72]Alright, we can do like one or two more.
[67:09.86]If you just stayed in the basement, you would've been fine.
[67:24.31]Hmm...
[67:28.43]You are the heir to the... You are the heir to the chocolate factory.
[67:42.74]The heir to the local chocolate factory.
[67:49.85]Your brother, who is your twin, also has a chocolate factory.
[68:01.04]You spend your days trying to convince the world that your half of the chocolate bar is better.
[68:12.92]Let's get this right.
[68:15.32]You are the heir to the local chocolate factory.
[68:17.20]Your brother, who is your twin, also has a chocolate factory.
[68:21.62]You spend your days trying to convince the world that your half of the chocolate bar is better.
[68:25.88]Done.
[68:33.96]It's Twix.
[68:40.71]You are the heir to the local chocolate factory.
[68:42.03]Your brother, who is also your twin, has a chocolate factory.
[68:44.09]You spend your days trying to convince the world that your half of the chocolate bar is better.
[68:47.35]Your sister is in charge of the other half.
[68:49.41]She spends her time making sure you don't try to take over too much and that you keep it running smoothly.
[68:54.37]There's three now.
[68:55.95]There's three bars on the Twix.
[69:00.85]Add oregano.
[69:04.82]to the recipe.
[69:12.34]Some middle twix now.
[69:18.36]The oregano adds a nice kick to this dish.
[69:20.44]It gives it just enough spice without overpowering everything else.
[69:23.97]Add the oregano after the chicken and before adding the rice.
[69:27.51]Ster well until combined and serve immediately with some crusty bread for dipping.
[69:33.07]Exclaim!
[69:37.49]that what um ah what the fuck do I do with this exclaim loudly what a great dinner exclaim how talk about how good that dinner was I I don't what do I work with here eat the crust
[70:01.14]No, the crust.
[70:01.66]What do you mean?
[70:02.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[70:02.76]Eat the crust.
[70:03.78]This crust tastes like heaven.
[70:05.54]The crunchy outside and soft inside makes it so perfect.
[70:08.44]You can almost imagine yourself eating this every day.
[70:11.22]It's not long before you're full, but you still have more than enough leftovers to share with everyone else.
[70:18.06]Take a tour of your sister's factory.
[70:25.36]Let's take a look at what's going on.
[70:30.70]We need new music.
[70:31.28]Leave the tour group.
[70:59.77]And unplug one of the machines.
[71:11.05]Fuck!
[71:11.55]I'm on!
[71:16.50]As soon as you exit the Toro group, you plug in one of the machines.
[71:21.44]This causes a loud beeping noise, followed by an alarm going off.
[71:28.25]No, I wanted to unplug, not plug.
[71:33.41]Get back to the group.
[71:44.31]This music is not correct.
[71:46.34]You quickly get back to the group where everyone is happily enjoying their treat.
[71:56.58]Uh, how about, um, cough and say you taste metal.
[72:07.57]Cough.
[72:09.17]Talk about the metallic, like, uh, like, ugh, like rat shit or something.
[72:14.65]Talk loudly about the foul smell of the chocolate bar.
[72:38.39]Hey guys, I think we should talk about the disgusting smell coming from that chocolate bar.
[72:51.02]Crowd.
[72:54.24]You notice the crowd.
[72:56.88]You notice the crowd spit out their treat.
[73:07.18]You notice the crowd spitting out their treats.
[73:13.56]Spitting out their teeth.
[73:19.29]Don't narrate, read.
[73:23.59]The crowd, you, the crowd spits out their treats.
[73:26.85]Isn't that, but that's, I noticed the crowd spitting out their treats, right?
[73:38.20]Right?
[73:39.04]I notice the crowd spitting out their treats.
[73:51.45]Oh no, not my chocolate bar, someone says.
[73:53.67]I'm sorry, I didn't realize it was that bad.
[73:57.61]Giggle.
[74:00.25]Maniacally.
[74:10.24]at giggle maniacally.
[74:21.93]This music's not fitting.
[74:23.45]What?
[74:23.65]Are you serious?
[74:24.51]Someone asks.
[74:28.14]Spit out the chocolate and scream.
[74:43.00]Oh my god.
[74:43.60]Oh my god, it's so good.
[74:46.57]I can feel the booze in me.
[74:48.09]Let me get more of that stuff.
[74:52.13]Ask security to remove the drunk person who somehow got in the tour group.
[75:02.72]Ask security to remove the drunk person.
[75:18.84]Security, please!
[75:19.72]Security!
[75:24.36]I see security.
[75:26.48]Take the man out of the tour guide.
[75:32.09]I see security.
[75:33.39]Take the man out.
[75:35.79]I see security.
[75:36.35]I see security.
[75:36.95]Take the man out.
[75:38.73]But just press enter.
[75:48.61]You shout.
[75:49.07]I watch security take the man out.
[75:57.33]Of, like, take the man out.
[75:59.06]I watch security take the man out.
[76:05.52]He's just a drunk.
[76:06.42]He can do nothing wrong.
[76:15.01]Wait, they want to leave him here?
[76:26.53]After security leaves, I watch the man dunk his entire hand in one of the chocolate vats.
[76:43.04]Like, you left him here!
[76:49.79]In one of the... How do you spell vats of chocolate?
[76:54.35]Vats?
[76:54.79]Vots?
[76:55.21]Vats of chocolate?
[76:55.97]Vats of chocolate?
[76:57.31]Like a vat.
[77:08.02]After security leaves, I watch... I watch the man dunk his entire hand in one of the vats of chocolate.
[77:17.56]Use vats for bonus damage.
[77:23.78]Yeah, that.
[77:29.69]You could've taken him out.
[77:33.45]You start laughing hysterically.
[77:34.89]Oh my god, this is so good, I want more!
[77:39.44]You demand more chocolate.
[77:45.64]I thought, I'm not supposed to like this, I'm supposed to tell people not to eat this.
[77:50.39]Jesus Christ!
[77:51.95]Oh, now we're getting goofy!
[77:58.51]I pour the entire bottle of vodka into the chocolate.
[78:22.20]You eat the chocolate with your hands.
[78:23.74]You continue eating until you're full.
[78:25.46]You then proceed to drink the rest of the alcohol in the bottle, which gives you an even bigger buzz than before.
[78:29.90]I puke in the... I puke in the section that says... Sanitation on... Please be...
[78:55.57]I puke in the chocolate container.
[78:57.65]I puke in the largest chocolate container.
[79:12.48]You get up and stagger around the room.
[79:14.04]You finally collapse on the floor.
[79:15.16]The next day you wake up from a nap feeling like a zombie.
[79:17.96]You wake up to the sound of loud music playing in your ear.
[79:21.80]I can't fucking handle this music anymore.
[79:30.43]It's my cell phone.
[79:31.71]It's your funeral.
[79:38.21]I reach over and answer the phone.
[79:44.86]It's just my ringtone.
[79:46.12]I'm lying on the ground.
[79:51.09]You hear a voice on the other end.
[79:52.19]Hello?
[79:52.49]You say, ooh, who are you?
[79:55.57]What do you want?
[79:56.15]The person on the other end says, I'm not sure yet, but I'll tell you something.
[79:59.31]Everything's soon.
[79:59.93]Then hangs up.
[80:11.98]Immediately call that number back.
[80:23.76]I immediately call that number back.
[80:30.42]You hear a male voice on the other end.
[80:31.74]Hello?
[80:32.98]You say, what did you do to me?
[80:34.22]The person on the other end says, nothing.
[80:36.41]I just wanted to make sure you were still alive.
[80:38.85]Then hangs up again.
[80:44.17]He's checking in on me.
[80:51.21]Get up.
[80:52.97]And get up.
[80:57.57]Look into the mirror.
[80:58.69]No, no mirrors in this one.
[81:04.12]You go to the door and look outside.
[81:05.62]It's almost completely dark now.
[81:06.92]You slowly walk towards the window.
[81:08.86]Suddenly, you feel something grab your arm from behind and pull you inside.
[81:13.26]A shadow covers your face as you're pulled inside by someone else.
[81:23.04]Look around the room.
[81:28.30]You can't escape the mirror.
[81:32.80]Oh no, it's Twix assassins.
[81:35.32]There's a table covered with food and drinks.
[81:37.56]On top of it sits a man dressed in black clothing holding a knife.
[81:41.31]He looks at you and smiles.
[81:44.13]You scream as loud as you can, causing everyone to turn their heads to see what's going on.
[81:49.97]I tell without...
[81:54.65]I tell the secret recipe.
[81:56.86]I yell out loud the secret recipe.
[82:02.64]I'm not fucking dying for this.
[82:09.83]I yell out loud the secret recipe.
[82:18.49]No, don't.
[82:20.37]I have to.
[82:22.38]You quickly repeat it for everyone.
[82:23.76]Everyone starts laughing and clapping along with you.
[82:26.60]You begin dancing wildly in the middle of the room while singing the song to yourself.
[82:31.73]Finally, you fall asleep on top of all these delicious foods.
[82:42.63]It was a musical.
[82:49.41]Ask
[82:51.78]the crowd to repeat what I just said.
[83:07.07]They all laugh and sing along with you.
[83:08.69]You find out later that the recipe was the Dark One's secret recipe.
[83:15.17]You awaken from your sleep in a cold sweat.
[83:25.56]what is the dark one's secret recipe right like what is the dark one's secret should I put this in quotes like I'm asking this right what is the dark one's secret recipe
[84:10.24]Someone tells you that they don't know.
[84:12.32]You decide to go to the Dark One's house.
[84:14.76]You walk through the forest and arrive at his home.
[84:17.10]You enter his house and find him sitting on a chair in front of a large fireplace.
[84:23.48]Ask.
[84:25.91]I ask, what is the secret recipe?
[84:35.75]Let's get it.
[84:43.26]The Dark One doesn't seem to be paying attention to you or anything else.
[84:47.22]You continue asking questions until he finally answers them all.
[84:51.20]You realize that the Dark One is a vampire and that he's been feeding off humans ever since he came into this world.
[85:03.73]There's blood in the twist.
[85:14.05]Wink?
[85:14.53]Alright, fine.
[85:22.63]Try... I try a bite of the blood chocolate.
[85:42.71]You feel like you could die right there, but you manage to survive.
[85:45.27]You tell everyone about how the Dark One fed off you and how he got here.
[86:02.94]I make the Dark One CEO of the company.
[86:10.48]Okay, I'm not that's what happens when you're but when a vampire bites, you don't even become like they're vampire They've owned you or something, right?
[86:26.19]You make sure that everything goes well and then you leave you find out later that the dark one died shortly after you left oh My god, why does everyone just die?
[86:40.58]You woke up in cold sweat.
[86:45.32]Sudden death syndrome.
[86:47.26]I know, what the fuck?
[86:54.57]I head to my brother's factory.
[87:02.77]Gotta check them out, both.
[87:09.34]You enter the factory and see that it's not really run by anyone.
[87:12.44]You notice that there are no machines in sight.
[87:15.20]You wonder if this means the Dark One isn't human after all.
[87:18.70]You start to think about how you should deal with this situation.
[87:23.26]Wait, so the Dark One has been... The brother is the Dark One.
[87:35.01]Check.
[87:35.27]Hmm.
[87:39.22]Hunt down the dark one.
[87:41.56]No.
[87:45.92]Hmm.

[87:51.96]Check the room.
[87:53.05]Check the... Check the fireplace.
[87:57.47]That's where he was sitting.
[87:59.15]Check the fireplace.
[88:01.43]That's where this motherfucker was sitting, remember?
[88:02.73]Remember?
[88:09.18]Sitting right in front of the fireplace.
[88:13.33]You hear something coming from inside.
[88:15.55]You open the door and see a giant shadow monster standing before you.
[88:19.41]It suddenly grabs you and throws you against the wall.
[88:22.31]It begins to drain your life force.
[88:28.40]It's too bad I'm a vampire.
[88:37.02]Too bad.
[88:44.17]You notice, I notice, I have no life force, so the monster cannot take it.
[89:05.02]Oh, fucking goddammit, I didn't press the N.
[89:11.07]You scream for help.
[89:11.83]A man comes running towards you.
[89:12.83]He looks very scared and runs away as fast as he can.
[89:14.71]You slowly get up and look around you.
[89:17.35]Revert.
[89:17.73]Revert.
[89:19.33]Revert.
[89:25.61]I have no life force.

[89:43.65]No, the effect is... No, it does not affect me.
[89:46.67]I have no life force that does not affect me.
[89:55.28]You scream for help.
[89:56.14]You're attacked by many other monsters.
[89:57.74]Your screams attract more monsters who come to kill you.
[90:00.76]All of them attack you, but they do nothing to save you.
[90:09.02]I...
[90:12.70]tell the monsters they could unionize and not need to answer to the big this big one this they're not need to answer to the big boss the big monster
[90:47.74]You decide to take some time to rest.
[90:49.10]You fall asleep again.
[90:49.98]I think I fucked it up.
[90:57.48]End of text.
[90:58.02]I'm sorry.
[90:58.46]I can't let you live.
[90:59.34]No, no.
[90:59.98]Tell the monsters to unionize.
[91:27.44]You decide to take control of the factory as you start to work hard and make lots of money.
[91:30.78]You become very rich.
[91:31.48]You begin to live happily ever after.
[91:32.90]So the monsters are all now working in the factory.
[91:43.87]Sell the company.
[91:53.43]You get drunk and watch TV.
[91:54.79]Suddenly you wake up.
[92:02.13]I'm sorry, I can't let you in.
[92:03.37]You're joking, right?
[92:04.17]How would I know what the secret recipe is?
[92:11.16]Eat all the food.
[92:13.18]Eat all the food in the fridge.
[92:21.72]I just made myself hungry.
[92:24.44]You don't get hungry anymore.
[92:25.61]You go back to your room and sleep.
[92:26.61]You stay at home for a long time thinking about how you could have done things differently.
[92:30.01]You decide to change the way you were living.
[92:48.26]Fire all the monsters, give them all a million dollars.
[92:56.57]They celebrate by drinking beer and smoking cigarettes.
[92:59.75]You tell them that now they must all work together or be fired.
[93:03.33]The monsters agree and immediately form a union called the Monster's Union.
[93:07.00]This is what I wanted you to do before!
[93:08.94]See?
[93:09.16]You got it!
[93:11.24]Alright.

[93:46.73]You tell them that they must all wear uniforms as well.
[93:52.23]They agree and immediately start wearing red shirts and black pants.
[93:56.48]You decide to give them new names, the workers and the humans.
[94:00.92]You decide to keep the no smoking signs around though.
[94:04.52]Take down the smoking, the no smoking signs.
[94:13.75]I want... It's turning into a target.
[94:25.73]You decide to give the workers free healthcare and a pension plan.
[94:29.19]They agree to immediately start getting tested for cancer, heart disease, diabetes, etc.
[94:34.01]You decide to make sure that they also get paid vacation days on top of their pensions.
[94:39.74]Let them smoke inside.
[94:41.30]I just want them to be able to smoke in the building.
[94:57.66]You decide to allow the workers to drink alcohol inside too.
[95:03.02]They agree and start doing it regularly.
[95:05.64]You decide to add a few more benefits like free haircuts.
[95:16.42]Free haircuts, massages, free food, and free internet.
[95:19.64]What is this, Google?
[95:24.50]The humans are happy with these changes.
[95:29.68]What do you mean the humans?
[95:35.27]Fill the room with cigarette smoke.
[95:54.99]You decide to...
[96:03.33]You decide to put out the fire.
[96:06.87]You decide to stop giving out free healthcare and pensions.
[96:09.86]The workers are unhappy with this.
[96:11.58]You decide to increase taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and massage parlors.
[96:18.90]The workers are angry.
[96:20.14]So wait a minute.
[96:22.18]The workers are angry at this idea.
[96:34.99]The AI hates smoking.
[96:44.21]Smoke a cigar in front of everyone.
[96:49.03]I'm listening.
[96:55.46]You decide to give the workers a day off every week so they can relax.
[96:58.79]They agree and start taking vacations every year.
[97:01.41]You decide to raise the retirement age to 70.
[97:12.83]Collect taxes from the workers.
[97:22.68]You decide to increase the retirement age again.
[97:25.76]The workers are very upset by this idea.
[97:27.60]You decide to increase taxes on cigarettes, alcohol, and massage parlors yet again.
[97:31.95]They are really mad at this idea.
[97:36.03]Ask how much a pack of cigarettes is now.
[97:42.50]Ask how much a pack of cigarettes is.
[97:55.23]They say $10.
[97:59.11]You decide to raise the tax rate to $20 per pack.
[98:03.30]They agree, and then they demand that you lower it to $15 per pack.
[98:08.90]Hey, how much are cigarettes these days?
[98:10.96]$10?
[98:11.40]Well, now they're $20.
[98:12.00]Say...
[98:21.70]$50 a pack.
[98:21.92]Raise the price of cigarettes to $50 a pack.
[98:49.07]They refuse to pay any more than that and they will only buy from your competitors.
[98:53.25]You raise the price of liquor to $100 a bottle.
[98:56.41]They refuse to pay anything over that amount either.
[98:59.31]You've just been given an ultimatum by your employees.
[99:13.38]Hmm...
[99:19.56]Give out free hot dogs.
[99:23.04]Once a week.
[99:24.24]Is that alright?
[99:28.87]We're negotiating here.
[99:38.28]They don't want any more free hot dogs.
[99:41.02]You decide to increase the number of free hot dogs to five per week.

[102:20.24]The workers are happy with this change.

[104:59.51]Notice the... Notice the burg...
[105:17.25]Notice the... No, no mirrors, no mirrors.
[105:25.87]Say it's time for our company-wide yoga class.
[105:32.10]Like, let's get fucking out of here.
[105:39.68]You have successfully managed to make everyone miserable.
[105:54.73]Enjoy yoga.
[106:03.71]Your company is now happy again.
[106:13.74]We did it.
[106:18.34]Say... Wasn't this happening in my brother's factory?
[106:24.24]Okay, goodbye.
[106:25.28]Going back to my factory.
[106:26.84]Head back to my factory.
[106:39.13]You arrive at your factory and find that there are no more people around you.
[106:41.79]It seems like a normal day in your life.
[106:46.53]Turn on the chocolate machine.
[106:55.89]Well, of course there's no people around me.
[106:57.15]Those are workers at my brother's... The room is dark, except for a small light above the door which illuminates the room.
[107:04.62]A large chocolatier stands behind it, holding a tray of full, of shiny, black and white bars of chocolate.
[107:10.98]He looks up as you enter and smiles at you.
[107:13.02]Hello!
[107:13.32]Tell the chocolatier to add hot dogs to the chocolate.
[107:45.17]It made up a word?
[107:46.13]He nods his head slowly.
[107:49.46]Yes, yes, I know what you mean.
[107:50.86]He begins pouring some into a large bowl and places it on top of the tray of chocolate bars.
[107:59.52]Ask him to mix them together.
[108:10.64]Oh yes, please do, the chocolatier says.
[108:13.03]You look at the tray of chocolate bars and see that there are two types of chocolate.
[108:16.73]One has a lot of milk in it, and one type has very little milk in it.
[108:25.59]Pour... I can pour the hot dog mixture into the tray.
[108:44.21]The chocolatier quickly mixes the hot dog mixture with the chocolate.
[108:46.71]As he does so, he puts down a spoonful of chocolate onto the tray.
[108:50.24]He then starts adding more chocolate to the tray until it's completely covered by hot dog mixture.
[108:56.74]Ask him how it tastes.
[109:11.14]It's delicious, he exclaims happily.
[109:13.78]You nod your head and continue eating the hot dogs.
[109:16.54]After you're finishing off your meal, you sit down in a chair next to the chocolatier who gives you an odd look.
[109:26.69]Sell them for $20 each.
[109:42.94]You look at the chocolate here and smile.
[109:44.88]I'll be in my office for a moment.
[109:47.04]You walk out of the room and open up your office door.
[109:49.14]Inside, you find yourself staring at a mannequin wearing nothing but a pair of tight white panties.
[110:07.62]I'll be in my office for a little bit.
[110:09.48]It's been a long day.
[110:11.16]I'm gonna go like, ugh.
[110:13.34]Like, ugh.
[110:28.53]Like, tidy whities?
[110:30.61]What?
[110:38.44]Sit in my chair.
[110:39.82]Oh, the AI is overloaded.
[110:46.10]Can't do that task.
[111:02.66]As you stare at the mannequin you feel a strange feeling.
[111:05.11]You don't understand why but something about this makes you uncomfortable.
[111:07.33]Then suddenly your eyes close and you fall asleep.
[111:10.13]Wake up and leave my office.
[111:14.58]I'm not even giving it a fucking chance.
[111:31.88]You wake up and notice that you're still sitting in your chair.
[111:35.04]You try to stand up, but you can't move any further than where you were before.
[111:38.79]Your body feels numb and cold.
[111:40.65]Suddenly, the sensation goes away, and all that remains is a dull ache throughout your entire body.
[111:48.31]Look for the mannequin.
[111:50.67]How do you spell mannequin?
[111:58.85]Yeah, mannequin.
[111:59.27]I got it.
[112:07.69]I got sick from the chocolate?
[112:09.77]You search the room for the mannequin, but find nothing.
[112:12.46]You look around the house again and realize that you aren't even sure if you're home anymore.
[112:15.98]This place is just too weird and unsettling for you to ever want to return here.
[112:24.94]Open the desk drawer and eat a calming hot dog.
[112:49.57]You open the desk drawer and take out a small brown paper bag from which you pull out a hot dog wrapped in foil.
[112:54.60]You bite into the hot dog as it sizzles on your tongue and savor its salty taste.
[113:03.82]Chop a hot dog and roll it in tobacco paper.
[113:24.22]You roll up the hot dog and wrap it in tobacco paper.
[113:26.82]You then stuff the rolled up hot dog into a large plastic bag.
[113:29.82]You put the bag inside a larger bag.
[113:37.09]And shove everything else back into your drawer.
[113:40.97]That's my secret hot dog joint.
[113:46.19]Smoke the hot dog joint.
[114:12.05]You light up the cigarette and inhale deeply through your nose.
[114:15.53]The smoke fills your lungs and makes you cough violently.
[114:17.95]You exhale slowly, taking care not to let the smoke escape out of your mouth or nostrils.
[114:32.30]Open up drawer and inhale deeply.
[114:41.06]Like, I'm getting the hot dog scent.
[114:47.46]You open up the drawer and take out a pack of cigarettes.
[114:49.08]You light one up and begin to smoke it.
[114:50.62]It takes some effort, but eventually you manage to get a good grip on the cigarette between your teeth.
[114:58.49]It's time for dinner?
[114:59.29]What?
[115:06.29]Oh, shit, it kind of is.
[115:09.15]Oh, yeah, they have dinner.
[115:10.05]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, alright, let's end this.
[115:13.43]Okay, hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you're right, you're right.
[115:19.34]You open the drawer, take a pack of cigarettes.
[115:25.06]Use hot, the hot dog as goggles.
[115:28.84]I don't know, what the fuck am I supposed to do now?
[115:30.76]I'm like, no, I'm just like obsessed with them.
[115:37.73]You hold the cigar in your hand and blow on it, letting the smoke escape out of your mouth.
[115:42.08]You then use the cigar as a makeshift straw to suck on the smoke coming off of it.
[115:46.74]As you do so, you see an image appear in front.
[115:52.96]Okay, so, uh... What is the image in front of me?
[116:20.83]The image appears to be a young girl's face looking down at you with tearful eyes.
[116:24.41]She has long black hair and her skin is pale white.
[116:26.33]Her eyes are blue and she looks very sad.
[116:27.94]Is Kim looking for a reservation?
[116:38.80]Say I'm sorry for being late to the dinner reservation.
[116:50.18]Say sorry for being late to the dinner reservation.
[117:06.29]You quickly turn around and apologize to the woman who is now staring at you with tears streaming down her cheeks.
[117:11.26]She doesn't seem to have noticed you yet, but she does when you finish apologizing.
[117:16.48]Leave and go to dinner with girlfriend.
[117:32.76]You run outside and rush over to the car where you grab your keys and purse.
[117:36.62]You unlock the door and exit the house.
[117:38.39]You head towards your girlfriend's car but suddenly you hear a loud noise behind you.
[117:43.89]What?
[117:52.88]Here I'm gonna look out.
[117:55.75]Look behind me.
[117:57.03]What?
[117:57.53]What is it?
[118:06.13]You turn around and see a huge explosion that seems to come from all directions.
[118:09.80]What?
[118:10.10]It seems to come from all directions.
[118:15.98]All directions?
[118:17.99]What do you mean all directions?
[118:20.40]Your body feels like it's going down.
[118:22.44]What the fuck?
[118:27.96]Fall out.
[118:34.67]You fall backwards onto the ground still clutching your chest.
[118:46.65]What happened?
[118:51.81]What was that?
[118:54.01]What was it?
[118:56.25]What?
[118:56.65]Look around.
[119:07.68]You look around and see that the entire street is in flames.
[119:10.06]What the fuck?
[119:23.25]Go to dinner?
[119:23.97]I'm trying!
[119:24.83]There are no longer any buildings left?
[119:33.82]Why was there like a... Wake up from my dream!
[119:53.58]You awaken from your nightmare and realize that you're back home.
[119:55.48]You walk in the kitchen and find that everything's intact.
[119:57.76]Except for the refrigerator, which is broken and smoking.
[120:00.94]Inspect the fridge.
[120:12.33]You examine the fridge and find that it contains several bottles of beer.
[120:14.76]You pick up one bottle and sniff it.
[120:29.52]is what what is called what why is the fridge smoking why is the fridge smoking you ask your question aloud and the woman answers what did she say
[120:58.07]No, I'm go- I got time, I got time.
[121:22.44]Smoking with the fridge, what do you mean?
[121:23.86]Smoking with the fridge means that you put your mouth close to the side of the fridge and blow out some of its contents.
[121:29.17]This will make it easier for you to drink your beer without getting burned.
[121:35.35]I do that.
[121:37.79]I know I'm not supposed to do that.
[121:42.68]You do exactly that, and then take another sip of your beer.
[121:44.86]The smell is very strong, but you manage to ignore it as you continue drinking.
[121:48.19]After about half an hour, you feel sick, so you vomit into a trash bag and throw it away.
[121:52.67]I can't, it won't let me leave.
[122:09.66]You smoke the trash bag and then throw it away too.
[122:11.46]You've had enough of alcohol for today.
[122:23.66]I'm trying to- I'm trying to get to the end.
[122:31.07]You run full speed into the wall and fall over.
[122:33.07]You roll onto your stomach and crawl towards the door.
[122:35.51]But you can't get through it since all the glass has been shattered.
[122:39.61]No, I can't.
[122:40.43]I can't even die.
[122:52.36]No, not eat glass.
[122:53.76]I don't want to eat the glass.
[122:54.86]Eat the glass.
[122:56.16]Oh, no.
[122:56.54]I don't want to eat glass.
[122:57.68]I can't do it.
[123:08.70]Get up and run full speed into the fridge.
[123:15.19]You crawl towards the fridge and try to open it, but you don't have much luck.
[123:17.79]You finally succeed in opening it when you hear a loud noise.
[123:20.21]It's like something exploded inside the fridge.
[123:29.14]Oh, my fucking... Look around.
[123:38.22]You look around and see that the whole room is covered in broken glass.
[123:40.48]There's no way you could have gotten through it.
[123:42.44]You're going to need more help than just yourself.
[123:52.87]Fine, I'll do it.
[123:54.77]I got time.
[123:55.75]The reservation's an offer.
[123:56.65]I'm good.
[123:57.07]Don't worry.
[123:58.79]You grab a piece of broken glass from the floor and start eating it.
[124:00.69]The taste isn't bad at all.
[124:01.71]You finish it.
[124:12.31]You grab a piece of broken glass from the floor and start eating it.
[124:14.81]The taste isn't bad at all and you finish off most of it before you realize what's happening.
[124:19.02]You begin vomiting blood and falling unconscious again.
[124:26.98]Ask the wizards for help.
[124:39.61]As soon as you pass out, you suddenly wake up and scream for help.
[124:41.93]A voice answers back and tells you that there are no wizards here.
[124:44.98]They say they'll send someone to check on you later, but right now they want to talk to you privately.
[125:09.20]End the story.
[125:09.80]Dude, this has been a long... We've been going crazy.
[125:18.00]Riding.
[125:18.48]Turn off the game console right now.
[125:20.91]Riding.
[125:25.43]Get up and... Get up and... Make it to dinner on time.
[125:36.21]There are no explosions.
[125:38.57]No.
[125:38.95]Get up and make it to dinner on time.
[125:41.65]Get up and make it to dinner on time.
[125:51.35]You stand up and make it to dinner on time.
[125:52.69]Your stomach rumbles loudly every once in a while, but you still manage to make it.
[125:56.00]When dinner's done, you go back to sleep hoping that this was just a nightmare.
[125:58.60]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[125:59.64]It's not a nightmare.
[126:00.22]It's a wonderful evening with my girlfriend on our anniversary.
[126:04.32]God damn it.
[126:05.10]Um...
[126:10.47]Wake up and know it was a good time.
[126:15.29]It was not a nightmare.
[126:17.31]There.
[126:21.63]Done.
[126:25.50]Happy anniversary.
[126:36.54]There.
[126:36.88]Okay.
[126:37.10]Had a good time at our anniversary dinner.
[126:38.62]The end.
[126:46.61]There we go.
[126:47.63]You lie down in bed and enjoy your meal after finishing eating your refresh.
[126:50.67]Think about how lucky you were to be able to attend an event like this one day after another.
[126:54.59]And there it is.
[127:12.72]Done.
[127:20.02]Goodbye.
[127:22.16]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[127:25.80]Oh, I had to play the tune.
[127:27.32]I can't... Okay, remember I told you like three hours ago that I was going to sneeze?
[127:36.10]There it is.
[127:36.90]It happened.
[127:42.76]That was a lot of fun.
[127:45.86]But yeah, I gotta get going.
[127:48.00]Kim and I are doing our anniversary dinner tonight.
[127:51.51]And then tomorrow we're doing some stuff too.
[127:53.19]So I will be back.
[127:56.35]Let's get a schedule here for the weekend.
[127:59.37]No, no, I got time.
[128:00.53]Don't worry.
[128:00.95]I got time.
[128:01.47]I'm not gonna miss this shit.
[128:02.54]Don't worry, guys.
[128:03.24]Trust me.
[128:03.66]I'm good.
[128:05.10]The reservation's at like 6.45.
[128:07.58]I have like nine minutes to get there.
[128:08.96]It's fine.
[128:10.04]It's a joke.
[128:10.52]I'm kidding.
[128:13.43]So we got a... I'll be back on... We'll do Friday, Saturday, Sunday of this weekend.
[128:20.84]And we're going to do some cool stuff.
[128:22.28]We're going to start on Friday.
[128:24.24]We're going to do Black and White 2.
[128:26.32]Murius is back this weekend.
[128:30.26]And maybe that'll take us Friday, Saturday.
[128:34.84]Sunday, we'll probably start Mega Man Legends.
[128:38.62]And going into Monday, maybe.
[128:41.98]We'll see.
[128:46.54]Hopefully you had fun tonight.
[128:49.46]We'll see you again.
[128:50.10]I'm literally pogging.
[129:00.34]Is physical therapy going good?
[129:01.51]Yeah.
[129:02.41]I actually have another appointment this week.
[129:06.27]In like a day or two, I think, yeah.
[129:09.41]But yeah, I got to get to dinner.
[129:11.87]Thanks for hanging out with me for the last five hours or so.
[129:15.75]A couple of shorter streams in a row here.
[129:18.35]I've been kind of all over the place.
[129:21.81]I told you February is going to be really busy.
[129:24.27]But you do what you got to do, right?
[129:27.09]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[129:30.50]Friday, Saturday, Sunday.
[129:32.88]Mark it on your calendars.
[129:38.85]Have a good one.
[129:40.41]Let's do the outro.
[129:42.45]All jokes aside, I really do have plenty of time.
[129:44.17]Don't worry.
[129:48.04]Don't worry.
[129:52.12]All these fucking Photoshops.
[129:57.62]Alright, so we had... Let's get the bits and everything up.
[130:00.12]Let's get the music too.
[130:17.28]Mega Man Legends games are on PS3 for $2 on sale.
[130:20.78]Well, I already own them for PlayStation 1.
[130:25.18]So, unfortunately, I cannot buy those.
[130:27.44]Alright, here we go.
[130:34.73]Do they look any better?
[130:36.71]Are they... It's not that they're increased graphics, is it?
[130:40.83]Or is it just the same thing?
[130:44.90]Mm-hmm.
[130:45.48]I don't know.
[130:46.60]No remasters?
[130:47.10]Same thing.
[130:47.46]Okay, cool.
[130:47.96]Well, yeah, I got them already.
[130:51.22]But hey, Potion Dweller, thanks for the 300 bits.
[130:54.12]As a reminder to chat, save your winks for April 1st or the next day after the 1st so that he streams.
[130:59.01]We're going to do a huge wink dump on him and make him wink the whole stream.
[131:03.51]Oh, that's going to be ridiculous.
[131:07.57]Good luck with that.
[131:12.75]Sly161, thanks for the $2.50.
[131:14.47]Hey, Jerma, that wink kind of sucked.
[131:15.99]Can I have my money back?
[131:17.45]By reading this, you are contractually obligated to meet my demands, by the way.
[131:21.02]Anyway, see you later.
[131:23.64]I don't have my special signing pen, so that's not accurate.
[131:27.92]I only sign documents with my special signing pen, so nobody can forge it.
[131:31.50]I know exactly what the ink looks like.
[131:32.82]I know the exact color.
[131:33.60]That's not how it works.
[131:39.31]Hey, Winsock, thanks for the $15, 1500 bits from Winsock.
[131:43.39]Thanks a lot, man.
[131:45.54]Remember, today's my birthday.
[131:46.60]Just want to say thanks for the years of content.
[131:49.08]I'm still recovering from second-degree burns on my hand.
[131:51.58]So, glad you're giving me something to do today.
[131:55.06]That sounds painful.
[131:57.90]Hopefully, you recover well.
[132:02.37]Follow your doctor's instructions.
[132:04.55]Hopefully, you heal up nicely.
[132:07.34]Thanks a bunch for the $15.
[132:07.96]1500 bits.
[132:08.98]Appreciate it.
[132:15.00]Hey Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[132:17.20]Mega Man Legends 1 and 2 are some of my favorite games ever.
[132:20.24]If you stream the Zero ZX collection coming out, I'll literally pog my pants, I swear to God.
[132:25.73]We're getting a shitload of community subs right now.
[132:29.09]Uh, Win, or Wyan, just gave 10 community subs.
[132:33.09]Thank you, Wyan.
[132:35.84]Just back-to-back there, thanks.
[132:38.30]For the sub drops.
[132:41.58]I also want to make very clear here.
[132:44.81]Twitch staff was in here, Link.
[132:47.61]And gave a hundred community subs, so... That's ridiculous.
[132:53.17]Thanks for playing along, Link.
[132:55.37]That was fun.
[132:55.87]Thank you.
[132:56.19]With a huge amount of subs as well.
[133:01.35]SuperBruce gave six community subs.
[133:02.93]I think I said five earlier, so that was wrong.
[133:07.92]But thank you, SuperBruce.
[133:09.62]BasicFeral, thanks for the 1,800 bits.
[133:11.92]18 bucks.
[133:12.92]Leave stream for Kim.
[133:15.90]Don't worry.
[133:17.41]We've got a whole day planned, too.
[133:24.83]Appreciate it, though.
[133:25.41]Thanks.
[133:25.85]That's a huge amount of money.
[133:27.01]That's nearly $20 in bits.
[133:28.93]Thank you.
[133:31.62]I don't think you can plan a community crack night.
[133:33.38]I think they just kind of happen whenever you guys do crack.
[133:35.65]No one wants a community crack night.
[134:02.09]Uh, 4,500 bits came in from Goiki.
[134:05.79]So nearly $50.
[134:06.39]I didn't touch upon it earlier.
[134:08.41]That's a lot of fucking money.
[134:11.33]We love you, egomaniac streamer.
[134:13.27]Thanks for the huge money drop.
[134:14.67]Thanks for the $50.
[134:17.40]4,500 bits from Goiki.
[134:19.42]You're still here.
[134:21.60]Thank you.
[134:25.08]Kind of early to end.
[134:26.02]Yes, it is.
[134:26.52]But I have to... It's me and my girlfriend's anniversary.
[134:30.10]So we have dinner reservations, so that's why this stream is ending shorter than usual tonight.
[134:40.76]I'm a crack.
[134:41.86]Buy a snack.
[134:45.02]It's better when it happens organically.
[134:47.12]Yeah, I agree.
[134:49.42]You can't, like, plan on something like that.
[134:56.22]But thank you, Goiki.
[134:59.26]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the 250.
[135:00.33]It's kind of sad how your ironic joke about Winx being too much effort for you turned to reality.
[135:09.83]What are you talking about?
[135:10.47]What do you mean?
[135:11.59]Jerma hates Winx.
[135:22.20]This is from Diablo II.
[135:25.50]Like, that's so hard.
[135:27.38]Ugh, god damn it.
[135:29.74]Ugh.
[135:30.48]I have to... Somebody watched my stream for like 60 hours.
[135:33.84]I have to turn on my camera and go like this.
[135:37.60]God damn it.
[135:41.54]It's like such a... So hard to do that, apparently.
[135:47.21]Well...
[136:00.88]I know, I've seen the, I've seen the Jerma like, lights a spoon up and does crack.
[136:08.72]Anyways, uh, yeah.
[136:11.44]What do you want me to say?
[136:12.72]It's been, it's hard to... Where's my, what'd I do with my thing?
[136:18.95]I lost it, how?
[136:25.19]How did I lose it already?
[136:27.41]No, it's gone.
[136:28.31]Uh, exit out of the window.
[136:33.30]It's this crack spoon.
[136:34.40]I know it's not crack.
[136:38.64]But anyways, yeah, the winks are not going anywhere.
[136:41.08]Don't worry.
[136:42.78]I will do them.
[136:46.18]Hey, Autumn Dragons, thanks for the $2.50.
[136:47.82]You should replace the wink with turning on a facecam, but also add another $75,000 reward to turn off the facecam.
[136:55.44]No one's going to turn it off.
[136:57.84]People will turn it on.
[136:58.82]No one's going to spend $75,000 to turn it off.
[137:09.44]No, I should have it be 75,000 to turn it on and two to turn it off.
[137:20.62]Thanks, though.
[137:22.30]Earl of Illusion, thanks for the 250.
[137:23.60]Here's some more bits towards taking Kim to see Sonic on Valentine's Day.
[137:27.47]I swear to God, you're actually going to like it.
[137:29.13]I mean, Jim Carrey's in it.
[137:31.89]I'd probably love it.
[137:39.07]Sorry about that.
[137:41.25]What is this?
[137:43.35]Why is this playing?
[137:50.06]Get rid of this.
[137:52.94]How do I get rid of this?
[137:57.30]Wait, what?
[137:59.28]I don't want to play Metro Exodus.
[138:00.84]What the fuck is going on?
[138:05.95]Why can I not delete this?
[138:08.87]Okay, that was fucking weird.
[138:15.62]Um... Oh, shit!
[138:18.00]I just deleted the credits!
[138:20.46]I just deleted the credits.
[138:21.96]Come on.
[138:27.15]That was where the credits were.
[138:28.53]That's why I was confused.
[138:29.67]Too many tabs.
[138:31.53]Hold on.
[138:35.06]Those are the streamlabs credits.
[138:37.66]Hold on, wait, wait, I gotta fix this.
[138:46.32]Wait, how do I... Can I control?
[138:48.16]Okay, wait.
[138:49.87]No, no, no, I can undo.
[138:54.99]No, turn it off.
[138:56.27]Okay, I can fix it.
[139:07.59]Alright.
[139:08.39]Give me a second.
[139:11.81]Oh, he's got good dental.
[139:15.24]Dental implants.
[139:17.66]Hold on.
[139:19.08]What the fuck?
[139:19.66]Why does this keep happening to me?
[139:26.22]Why do you hate your past?
[139:28.57]I don't.
[139:30.67]I would delete all this stuff if I didn't like it.
[139:37.85]What did I search?
[139:40.41]What are you talking about?
[139:43.69]You just scammed a wink.
[139:45.19]No, no, no, no.
[139:45.85]I didn't.
[139:46.09]I didn't.
[139:46.35]I promise.
[139:46.73]My credits got fucking deleted.
[139:49.51]Hold on.
[139:53.19]There we go.
[139:53.73]Alright.
[139:54.05]Here we go.
[139:54.43]Here come the credits.
[140:00.33]No, nobody got scammed.
[140:04.31]Roll them.
[140:05.77]There they are.
[140:07.59]Thanks a lot, everybody, for the subs.
[140:08.85]Don't worry, you'll get your wink.
[140:12.15]Here it comes.
[140:15.24]You will get your wink right here.
[140:16.68]Check it out.
[140:27.00]That was a full... I'm wearing a fucking Star Wars... Yeah, yes.
[140:31.70]Yes, I'm wearing a Star Wars shirt.
[140:40.32]Whatever.
[140:41.30]Who cares?
[140:45.38]I'm not wearing this to dinner.
[140:46.78]I'm gonna change.
[140:51.12]You think I'm gonna go to my girlfriend's dinner anniversary in a Star Wars shirt?
[141:00.49]No, I'm not completely out of my mind.
[141:02.23]It's just that it's easy.
[141:06.35]Alright, I don't need to explain myself.
[141:08.39]Okay, let's go.
[141:12.37]But thank you, Link.
[141:13.09]Thank you, all the subs.
[141:14.01]A ton of them were community subs from today.
[141:16.07]100 from Link.
[141:20.57]Thank you, Earl of Illusions, for that.
[141:23.13]Sonic the Hedgehog.
[141:23.89]Appreciate it.
[141:24.35]Of course, I'm going to like that movie.
[141:26.85]Red Walrus, thanks for the 300 bits.
[141:28.70]What's your favorite Warhammer faction?
[141:30.16]It's the Tau.
[141:31.92]40k or Fantasy 40k?
[141:33.88]You can't pick the Skaven.
[141:35.04]That's cheating.
[141:35.60]Everyone likes the Rats.
[141:36.58]It's the Tau.
[141:38.02]I like the Tau.
[141:38.56]I think they have, like, interesting units.
[141:44.43]You're going to be late to your reservation.
[141:45.99]No.
[141:49.45]What is it?
[141:50.83]XV-22 Battlesuit?
[141:52.75]XV-22 Battlesuit ready.
[141:54.45]I like the hero.
[141:55.53]That is cool.
[142:03.40]Yeah, that's the one.
[142:04.90]Thank you, Red Wilders.
[142:05.66]Three bits.
[142:05.98]300 bits.
[142:08.68]Hey, ya boy, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[142:10.44]I missed it, but thanks for 10 subs.
[142:12.57]Give it to the community.
[142:14.27]Shazo, ready to take command.
[142:15.55]That's right.
[142:19.53]Mr. Chachimar.
[142:21.71]Mr. Chachimar, thanks for the 300 bits.
[142:23.62]They just say hi, Jeremiah.
[142:24.52]Hi.
[142:27.88]Lizard Amiibo, 300 bits.
[142:29.32]Thanks for a really great stream tonight.
[142:30.44]It's been one of my favorites.
[142:31.92]That's good to know.
[142:33.50]Thank you.
[142:34.40]Also, thanks for helping me escape my bathroom.
[142:36.26]You're welcome.
[142:38.00]Secret techniques if you ever get yourself in a situation like that.
[142:40.46]Careful.
[142:42.84]The Point!
[142:43.38]Thanks for 300 bits of The Point.
[142:45.50]Remember, this is such a good stream.
[142:46.66]I hope you have a good anniversary with Kim.
[142:49.22]This is so funny and amazing.
[142:50.90]Holy shit, laughing my ass off.
[142:56.72]Thank you.
[143:01.47]Hmm.
[143:03.40]LOL.
[143:03.48]LOL.
[143:03.56]What?
[143:05.44]Me?
[143:05.54]You're talking about me?
[143:08.30]No, I can't.
[143:08.54]No.
[143:33.74]Hey, disinterest, thanks for the 250.
[143:34.96]No, just hurt people's ears around me and annoy them.
[143:39.74]That's pretty much it.
[143:40.32]Five bucks?
[144:04.51]Hope you and Kim have a happy anniversary.
[144:06.45]Also hope the physical therapy is going well.
[144:08.77]Love the streams as always, even if I'm not really as active in the community I used to be.
[144:12.61]As I used to be.
[144:13.93]These streams always put a smile on my face.
[144:16.51]I'll get the hell out of here and go see Kim.
[144:18.49]Oh, I am.
[144:21.23]Yeah, the PT is going well.
[144:23.21]I only had one appointment, so I'm going to wait and see how it goes over the next three, four weeks.
[144:28.97]And see what happens after that.
[144:33.81]Thanks a lot, Rodion.
[144:36.98]Worm Club.
[144:37.80]Thanks for the 500 bits, Worm Club.
[144:41.46]Jerma, I've been watching your streams and VODs for only a few months, but I've already joined the Had a Dream About Jerma Club.
[144:48.37]I dreamt that you got your start making webcam videos of yourself smoking massive amounts of keef and reviewing it set to cheesy psychedelic music.
[144:59.46]Anyway, I love you, man.
[145:00.34]I hope your PT fixes you up and you don't have to smoke keef for pain.
[145:04.16]Happy anniversary to you and Kim.
[145:05.30]Thanks a lot, Worm Club.
[145:09.31]a marijuana review stream I almost it would take a little some effort but it would be kind of funny this is by the way add this to the list of things that I'm gonna say that I'm never gonna do but it would be funny is to get a bunch of dreams that people have had about me and just reenact them and just have like a watch all these streams like just do a watch party it's like three hours of just fucked up dreams people have had
[145:42.96]That would take a lot of effort.
[145:45.40]It would be kind of funny, though.
[145:46.42]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the $2.50.
[145:49.72]Remember how you once talked about how you don't read resubs and bits during gameplay portions of the stream because they get in the way and derail the stream?
[145:57.08]Well, the Winx are essentially that, but with fake currency to do it.
[146:02.54]True, but also.
[146:04.80]But also true.
[146:06.56]The Winx take one second.
[146:10.78]Reading a sub-message and responding to a sub-message takes, as you see here, a good... Sometimes I spend one, two, five minutes on a message.
[146:23.76]Usually it takes about a minute or two.
[146:26.27]I turn the webcam on and I go bang, and the webcam goes off in about four seconds.
[146:35.31]Sometimes you get distracted by your own face.
[146:38.44]Don't worry.
[146:39.30]The winks are going to last as long as they need to.
[146:42.08]What do you think Jerma smells like?
[146:46.68]Oud.
[146:48.18]Mystery salt.
[146:49.56]That's true.
[146:53.24]Thank you, Tingy, though.
[146:53.92]Appreciate it.
[146:56.45]Super Tentorian, thanks for the 300 bits.
[146:58.39]Jerma, funny question.
[146:59.15]Is your hat in the channel trailer from a certain city starting with a P in Massachusetts?
[147:04.19]Don't answer if you aren't comfortable.
[147:08.21]um let me see I don't think so I think that's like a longhorn's hat hold on let me see yeah that's a longhorn's hat sorry
[147:38.08]That is a Texas Longhorns hat.
[147:44.60]Why did I have a Texas Longhorns hat?
[147:47.92]I don't... I cannot tell you the reason why.
[147:50.58]I think... I think it was my brother's hat.
[147:55.84]I can't believe he likes the towel.
[147:58.52]Why?
[147:58.78]What's wrong with the towel?
[148:02.39]Hey, and finally, we have... Well, let me get this back to where we need to be, because this is the end of the stream.
[148:09.10]This is the end.
[148:11.38]Uh, we have $5 from Daddy.
[148:13.12]Thank you, Daddy, for the 500 bits.
[148:15.82]You excited for the Gorillaz and Tame Impala collab?
[148:18.41]Congrats on the anniversary, man.
[148:23.75]Yeah, I mean, any Gorillaz album I'm excited for.
[148:27.71]Although I really, I wish, I know that David Alpern does this thing sometimes, and all of his, I love pretty much anything he does, and anything, anybody he collabs with, and all the music that they make.
[148:39.50]But so, like, Humans came out, right?
[148:42.86]And then it was, but now, now, like, not even a year later.
[148:47.12]And I think, doesn't he do this sometimes, where he just kind of, let's get it out, get it out, let's, like, get, like, 20 more tracks out.
[148:53.99]And they were, like, recorded on the road.
[148:56.89]He did that with another album before, too.
[149:03.08]What was the one with the fall?
[149:04.82]Where he did it, like, on the road?
[149:08.44]So, is this... This is not an album, from my understanding.
[149:13.56]This is sort of this kind of new series they're going to be doing.
[149:18.07]It's not an album.
[149:18.85]It's just, like, a series of music and videos and stuff.
[149:23.75]It's not an album, right?
[149:28.69]Anybody correct me here?
[149:30.79]Yeah, I think so.
[149:32.47]Kinda.
[149:36.50]It'll eventually be an album, but for now it's just a series, okay?
[149:39.78]No, that's cool.
[149:42.62]That's pretty cool.
[149:43.08]You have five minutes for your reservation.
[149:45.44]No.
[149:48.29]Daddy, again, thanks for the 500 bits.
[149:49.65]Yeah, I asked if your favorite band, who your band was.
[149:51.69]I said that wrong.
[149:53.13]I asked who your favorite band was on the Comb stream and checked them out and heard about it the other day.
[149:57.81]I think it's a single or series.
[149:59.17]Yeah, yeah, that makes sense.
[150:01.19]I'm glad you checked them out.
[150:01.93]They're a great band.
[150:04.37]And my favorite songs are Gorillaz songs.
[150:09.84]Please notice me, Jeremiah.
[150:10.72]I'm too poor for your rich minimum requirement price.
[150:13.36]Hey, Ganja Lane, how the fuck are you?
[150:17.38]Done.
[150:18.56]Noticed.
[150:18.86]But yeah, no, I'm looking forward to whatever they come up with.
[150:27.34]And I'm gonna go seek him.
[150:29.74]I will see you guys on Friday.
[150:32.24]Black and White 2.
[150:34.30]Murius will probably return if we can get a cow.
[150:37.93]See you guys on Friday.
[150:39.41]We'll do all weekend.
[150:42.65]Good night.
[150:43.41]Goodbye.
[150:44.99]And who is streaming right now?
[150:48.66]What do we have?
[150:49.08]This is live.
[150:51.06]Anybody live right now that we can go scream at?
[151:00.24]Go say hi to Joel.
[151:02.41]Playing Quake 2.
[151:05.51]Cooking Simulator.
[151:06.47]Wait, is he playing Cooking Simulator right now?
[151:13.49]Is he Cooking Simulator?
[151:14.36]Because that's fun.
[151:17.18]It's probably like...
[151:20.44]Oh, he's doing Quake, okay.
[151:21.24]Alright, yeah, go say hi to Joel.
[151:29.39]Tell Joel I said what up.
[151:38.47]Show Joel the mirror.
[151:39.75]Alright, I'll see you guys on Friday.
[151:45.02]Take care, goodnight.
[151:47.84]Much love to you.
[152:22.50]you
