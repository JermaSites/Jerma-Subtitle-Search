[00:00.91]Yeah, Half-Life Alyx.
[00:03.05]Half-Life Alyx.
[00:03.85]I've been waiting about a year.
[00:05.87]Wait a while to play Half-Life Alyx.
[00:11.01]I told you.
[00:11.53]Everybody thought I was going to take a day off today.
[00:13.97]No, I'm here.
[00:16.26]After yesterday, I was a little tight, yes.
[00:18.14]But I'm not taking a day off.
[00:20.90]I got VR to play.
[00:23.34]So in an hour and ten minutes when this stream has to turn off, we can both be right.
[00:27.90]How does that sound?
[00:35.79]How you guys doing?
[00:38.13]Hope you're doing well.
[00:42.51]How drunk is he?
[00:44.55]Ugh.
[00:46.59]On a scale of 1 to 10?
[00:47.49]Maybe like... Like 7.
[00:49.86]It's like 2-15, guys.
[00:52.74]I'm obviously a 7 right now.
[00:54.32]No, I've got a coffee in my hands.
[01:08.12]You're always a seven.
[01:11.00]Don't play Alex on the Vive.
[01:13.60]Well, this is... I'm sorry.
[01:19.45]I'm the sorry bastard that got the Wii and have to play the shitty version of the AAA games.
[01:29.49]They got Call of Duty 3 on the Xbox.
[01:33.47]Call of Duty 3 on the Wii.
[01:36.16]was like an N64 game.
[01:38.36]I have the Wii version of all these AAA games.
[01:46.19]Or they just make a party game.
[01:48.41]And they do, oh, Assassin's Creed for the Xbox 360.
[01:53.23]High 1080p graphics.
[01:55.56]And then they make the one for the Wii.
[01:57.30]Assassin's Creed, where's the party?
[02:00.34]And there's bowling.
[02:02.94]I had to play that one.
[02:11.76]And they all have, like, big heads.
[02:15.16]They all got, like, big, like, Wii avatar heads.
[02:18.92]But me, sorry, me.
[02:20.36]Sorry.
[02:20.62]Please play Assassin's Creed Wii Bowling.
[02:32.56]Big head tennis.
[02:35.24]Don't make fun of my weird mannerisms.
[02:40.57]I'm aware of them.
[02:44.08]Remember, anytime I'm about to say something, I say, oh.
[02:47.94]Oh, and, and, oh.
[02:49.82]Oh, I know that.
[02:50.66]Like, it's been made, people have told me that a thousand times.
[02:52.99]I know.
[02:55.47]Oh, oh.
[02:57.23]It even bleeds into other characters.
[03:01.47]Dick Bugleberry.
[03:03.25]It's just like, oh.
[03:04.79]And, oh, oh.
[03:07.22]I can't help it.
[03:09.92]It's a filler word.
[03:12.62]When are you going to play Chubby Bunny?
[03:13.70]I'm not playing Chubby Bunny right now.
[03:15.80]I'm doing Half-Life Alyx, the most anticipated virtual game since the second one came out.
[03:23.78]Now, a lot of people were hyped up for this game.
[03:27.46]I kind of wasn't.
[03:28.50]So, I'm going in with completely just basic expectations.
[03:36.85]I'm really not hyped up about this at all.
[03:39.29]So...
[03:41.31]I'm not a liar, I swear to God.
[03:42.31]I have to be completely honest with you guys.
[03:45.87]I kind of don't even care that I'm playing this right now.
[03:49.15]I've made sure to not give a shit.
[03:52.63]Because I want to be either blown away or not like... I don't want it to... I got to have my expectations.
[03:57.73]Like, I don't care, right?
[03:58.83]I've been telling myself, nah, you don't fucking care.
[04:00.27]Who cares?
[04:01.67]It's just a dumb game.
[04:02.87]Who cares?
[04:08.13]You're going to get blown to hell.
[04:11.42]Get the other controllers.
[04:13.02]I got the Wii controllers, alright?
[04:16.22]What's wrong with you?
[04:17.18]What do you mean what's wrong?
[04:18.00]What's wrong with you?
[04:18.76]Why are you saying that?
[04:23.34]Here we are.
[04:26.02]And just in case you didn't know, just in case you didn't know, I'm on Twitch.
[04:35.41]You ever think...
[04:37.02]No, I've already talked about this.
[04:38.56]I already went over, like, if the doctor went to the drive-thru with his doctor's coat on.
[04:44.28]Like, I don't like to wear this shit.
[04:46.07]Anywhere besides, like, in front of the camera here.
[04:49.81]Because people see the shirt and they go, You Twitch?
[04:54.31]Twitch, huh?
[04:55.39]And I'm just like, oh, yeah.
[04:57.69]I'm a fan.
[04:58.97]I don't even... I, like, I stole this.
[05:03.41]I stole this shirt.
[05:05.93]It's like, if a doctor goes to, like, a drive-thru at Dunkin' Donuts, and he wears his lab coat, they're gonna be like, You're a doctor?
[05:15.82]Yeah.
[05:16.14]Yeah, fuck, I forgot I had this on.
[05:18.76]No, no, I'm an engineer.
[05:21.36]I don't do that.
[05:26.34]Somebody said, nice bulge.
[05:28.35]Oh, that's funny.
[05:29.47]That you can literally not see below my waist right now.
[05:33.25]And that guy for 20 minutes.
[05:38.62]Like, you mean this?
[05:41.92]Is that what you mean?
[05:44.18]Is that the thing you're describing?
[05:46.50]I mean, that's there.
[05:49.02]That's what we mean.
[05:50.06]Right, okay.
[05:53.55]He's got a dad bod.
[05:56.81]I'm not 20.
[05:57.83]I'm not even 25.
[05:58.85]I'm not even 30.
[06:00.11]I look good for 35, okay?
[06:04.72]You can see the outline of my breasticles.
[06:08.65]Don't you know that means that's a good thing for a 35 year old?
[06:13.53]I can do this!
[06:14.11]And I can do this!
[06:16.21]That actually kind of hurt.
[06:22.87]I shouldn't do that.
[06:23.45]You know, if you tell yourself that you look good in the mirror over and over again, at some point, hey, guess what?
[06:29.29]What's that?
[06:29.71]Oh, wow, that's the wart finger.
[06:30.71]No, it's not.
[06:31.03]It's covered up today.
[06:31.67]Sorry about that, guys.
[06:34.40]No wart jokes today.
[06:37.15]Alright, I'm ready.
[06:37.87]No more stalling.
[06:38.67]Wait, I need one more sip of coffee.
[06:54.84]I don't want the thing to fly off.
[06:58.83]Oh, let me put it down on my coaster.
[07:06.63]bedroom of like an 11 year old boy.
[07:09.11]You guys ready for Half-Life, Alex?
[07:15.92]Or should I continue?
[07:19.80]I'm going in.
[07:22.10]I'm about to go in.
[07:22.80]And then I gotta get this shit good.
[07:27.64]Look, you get to stall on a game like this.
[07:31.36]This is the plan for today.
[07:32.30]I'm not changing games.
[07:34.14]Like, I'm playing Half-Life Alyx until I can't breathe anymore.
[07:37.55]Which would probably be in about an hour.
[07:39.11]Two hours.
[07:39.61]Three.
[07:39.85]I don't know.
[07:40.15]Maybe four.
[07:42.01]You're a doomer.
[07:42.69]No, I'm not.
[07:52.28]How would I be a doomer?
[08:01.29]Ready.
[08:02.29]God, it's been so long since I've gone into the world of Half-Life.
[08:06.75]I forgot the whole story because it was seriously like fucking 15 years ago.
[08:13.14]I can't wait to not even know fucking basic characters' names.
[08:20.74]Why is this so tight?
[08:21.48]This hurts.
[08:24.56]Ow.
[08:26.50]This fucking hurts.
[08:28.16]I think I broke it from last night.
[08:29.58]I didn't even care.
[08:33.54]Okay, I'm ready.
[08:34.00]You guys ready?
[08:38.41]Here we are.
[08:44.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[08:45.63]Didn't I fuck with this last night?
[08:46.73]64, right?
[08:50.43]Show the settings.
[08:53.79]I'll show the settings in a second.
[08:55.18]Hold on.
[08:55.38]I can't even hear myself talk.
[08:56.48]Okay.
[08:59.30]Do not quit.
[08:59.92]Show the settings.
[09:01.12]Sure.
[09:01.34]Okay.
[09:04.74]Wanna see?
[09:06.08]There.
[09:06.68]There you go.
[09:07.94]There you go.
[09:08.96]Okay.
[09:09.48]Yeah.
[09:09.74]It's on low.
[09:10.30]I got a 1080.
[09:10.64]I can't even put that on medium, I don't think.
[09:20.44]Here we go.
[09:24.61]Difficulty normal.
[09:25.89]Challenging combat.
[09:27.19]Very challenging.
[09:30.25]Easy.
[09:30.83]Wait, there's a mode below easy?
[09:35.20]Is this a story mode?
[09:36.42]Do you even play the game or do you just sit and watch?
[09:41.40]That's actually kind of cool.
[09:42.33]Alright, I'm doing normal.
[09:44.57]No, we're not doing hard.
[09:46.71]That's not happening.
[09:48.43]Movement.
[09:48.93]Blink.
[09:49.53]Teleport to destinations with fast linear movement.
[09:53.85]Move continuously based on your head orientation.
[09:56.73]Ugh.
[09:57.89]Move continuously based on your hand orientation.
[10:00.49]Or blink.
[10:05.25]There's no audio.
[10:06.03]What the fuck?
[10:06.77]Oh, sorry.
[10:13.29]Where the fuck is the mouse?
[10:17.61]There you go.
[10:19.17]Got it.
[10:21.07]Okay, good.
[10:23.67]Wait, which one of these is better?
[10:24.55]Blink?
[10:24.77]Smooth head orientation.
[10:29.75]Is that the best one?
[10:33.43]Blink sucks.
[10:37.32]Continuous hand.
[10:38.06]Continuous hand.
[10:44.98]Can I change this?
[10:49.54]Continuous head.
[10:52.34]Can I stop moving?
[10:53.32]Continuous head.
[10:54.42]Okay.
[10:56.40]Oh.
[10:57.56]Game slot.
[10:59.15]SO.
[11:01.97]50?
[11:03.13]Alright, shh.
[11:03.75]Quiet!
[11:04.13]Here comes the cutscene.
[11:06.39]Good to go, hello, Alex.
[11:17.78]That was not a good impression.
[11:26.11]Right.
[11:32.49]Do I get visited?
[11:33.37]Do I get visited by a Gorgonot?
[11:36.83]It's five years before the collapse of the Citadel and the death of Eli Vance.
[11:41.95]Oh yeah.
[11:44.07]Alex Vance, age 19, female.
[11:47.29]Human resistance.
[11:49.59]Current assignment.
[11:51.67]Reconnaissance.
[11:54.97]Why are you here?
[11:55.95]This is like the third game they've made.
[11:59.01]What are you doing here?
[12:03.24]You don't jump- you don't watch, like, fucking Return of the Jedi first, and then go, wait, hold on, Darth Vader is just dead?
[12:16.79]Holy shit.
[12:19.97]And low-fidelity graphics, my ass, this looks fantastic.
[12:32.57]What station does it have to be on?
[12:33.79]Push to move.
[12:42.55]Close.
[12:43.19]Whoa!
[12:47.75]Push snap, turn left or right.
[12:50.75]Oh, that's okay.
[12:53.99]Pretty good fidelity, I think.
[13:00.06]Oh fuck, I beat it?
[13:06.01]hit somebody all of a sudden you hear like oh!
[13:11.65]What's it saying?
[13:32.01]Why am I acting like a caveman?
[13:34.11]That was just handed this.
[13:36.57]Ooh, it's just... This make me angry.
[13:51.57]Aw, dude, sick, you got a fucking GTX 3090.
[13:53.45]What do I have to do?
[14:02.16]What do I do?
[14:05.78]Crush the can.
[14:13.25]Oh, you can't!
[14:13.99]Isn't there like a fucking alien invasion?
[14:36.77]Oh, incoming call.
[14:41.67]How do I turn on device?
[14:43.71]Oh, I hate that already.
[14:45.89]MetroCop movement is normal.
[14:47.33]Same for the Combine patrols.
[14:49.23]How's it going in the stockyard?
[14:52.78]Oh, I don't like that subtitle.
[14:54.66]They're never going to miss it.
[14:56.92]Here, see for yourself.
[14:59.90]Don't get greedy, guys.
[15:01.86]We're not made of time here.
[15:06.90]One minute and I'm out.
[15:07.92]Guaranteed.
[15:09.58]Oh, also, I spotted the Combine moving supplies into the quarantine zone.
[15:13.89]That place has been deserted for years.
[15:17.55]That is odd.
[15:19.71]Well, we'll look into it when we get back.
[15:22.35]Oh, let's pay attention.
[15:23.19]What is this?
[15:23.69]Beat back at the safe house, baby.
[15:25.45]Beat back at the safe house.
[15:27.40]What is it, Russell?
[15:29.58]Is the game blinking?
[15:30.90]Is my character blinking?

[16:37.69]I'm telling you, the shit's blinking.
[16:51.86]How do I get out of here?
[16:56.06]Enable spectator mode.
[16:57.38]It's too jerky.
[17:06.83]Able spectator.
[17:07.67]I think it's already on.
[17:10.40]Medium?
[17:11.30]Turn on spectator.
[17:12.08]Yeah, it's already on.
[17:14.10]What button do I press?
[17:15.04]Capture the game window.
[17:19.16]Capture the game window.
[17:22.01]Isn't that what I'm doing?
[17:23.99]Or capturing the wrong thing?
[17:28.95]Capture game window.
[17:30.16]Wait a minute.
[17:30.76]I'm coming out.
[17:34.69]I'm capping the VR view.
[17:36.83]Should I not be doing that?
[17:39.32]Capture the actual game engine.
[17:52.44]Spectator mode shows us your ammo and shit.
[17:54.64]Oh.
[17:56.40]Wait a minute.
[17:59.99]Turn off the subtitles.
[18:01.26]Wait, hold on.
[18:01.86]This is like a lot to take in right now.
[18:04.60]I'm doing the Steam mirror thing, so I just cap the actual game.
[18:07.44]Like that.
[18:28.80]So this is like the actual game being captured, not the VR window.
[18:40.45]Okay.
[18:43.69]The game is now being captured.
[18:48.15]How do you actually get into the settings of the game?
[18:50.87]What's the pause menu?
[18:58.56]Left grip.
[19:05.19]Oh, fuck yeah.

[19:32.60]And turn off the subtitles.
[19:34.96]Is that good?
[19:35.48]Alright.
[19:46.19]Subtitles for Spectator only.

[24:59.01]Nobody could do more wire but him.
[25:01.09]Hey!
[25:05.56]Are we good?
[25:07.12]Yep, they got the reactor.
[25:08.54]Easy peasy.
[25:09.80]I'm headed back to the safe house right now to meet Dad.
[25:11.84]The dinosaur DNA is in here.
[25:14.50]Stay safe.
[25:15.54]Hey!
[25:41.16]Wow!
[25:42.10]Ow!
[25:42.48]My hand!
[25:45.17]Too much strength!
[25:46.53]Too much strength!
[25:49.45]What's in here?
[25:50.25]Documents!
[25:50.81]Alright, go!
[26:00.48]We're under attack!
[26:09.31]I have to, like, move my body.
[26:10.67]Alex, over here.
[26:11.55]Hey!
[26:12.13]What is it?
[26:13.53]This doesn't seem like a routine sweep.
[26:16.18]Are you sure everything went OK?
[26:18.34]100%.
[26:18.36]Hey, let's do a funny thing.
[26:20.60]Get a camera.
[26:22.60]I'll be like, hey, let me out of here.
[26:24.20]Go!
[26:47.32]Oh yeah!
[26:48.30]Here we go!
[26:53.14]Didn't work, didn't work, didn't work, didn't work.
[26:54.84]How do I run?
[27:01.70]How do you run?
[27:03.70]He's so slow.
[27:05.02]What?
[27:13.30]There we go!
[27:14.14]You gotta use your fuckin' environment!
[27:26.52]Oh, it didn't see me.
[27:28.76]Oh, shit.
[27:29.40]Cargo.
[27:30.62]In there?
[27:31.18]Door.
[27:57.76]What is door?
[27:58.61]What is door?
[28:00.57]Hey, hey, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[28:01.87]I just, ow, come on.
[28:12.91]Fred.
[28:15.97]Eat this.
[28:19.42]Hey, I feel like something just popped up on my hug.
[28:21.40]What?
[28:22.00]Oh, he cooked, thumbs up, I ate it.
[28:38.10]Okay, I'm gonna fall.
[28:53.55]And that's, ladies and gentlemen, what it would look like if bugs ruled the world.
[28:59.27]If bugs were even 20% larger than they are now, that's the kind of shit we'd be dealing with.
[29:11.60]I would never leave my house.
[29:12.88]Ever.
[29:14.88]Uh, should I bring this with me?
[29:31.61]Might need it.
[29:46.37]Alright, it's just like Hitman.
[29:49.13]It's just like fucking Hitman.
[29:50.61]I got like my guns in here.
[29:52.23]And they're gonna pat me down.
[30:05.97]I just got a delivery.
[30:08.23]I got a delivery.

[30:11.65]Wait, wait, wait.
[30:12.24]Don't shoot.
[30:15.40]Come on, pat me down.
[30:18.40]I got a delivery for the mafia boss.
[30:20.98]We didn't steal anything.
[30:28.31]It's just flowers, for fuck's sake.
[30:30.31]No, I didn't see anyone.

[32:53.57]Do we know where they're taking him?
[33:00.51]But I'm already working on a plan to get him back.
[33:02.85]You're close to my lab.
[33:04.52]Keep following the drone, we'll figure out what to do.
[33:06.62]Russell, what did you guys find back there?
[33:13.07]crazy thing.
[33:13.81]I don't know.
[33:15.65]Just blurry pictures.
[33:19.69]Something else.
[33:20.73]And whatever it is, they're going to kill anybody who saw it.
[33:23.27]And anybody who knows anybody who saw it.
[33:25.77]Which means us.
[33:27.19]Jump indicator.
[33:28.41]Russell, just hang on.
[33:30.69]I'm almost there.
[33:34.00]Oh.

[34:15.01]Alright, it's me versus you, chat.
[34:16.07]Ready?
[34:21.22]I'm X's UROs, okay?
[34:22.62]Guess what?
[34:27.06]It'll... Okay, I'm over it.
[34:37.46]Wait, can I...
[34:47.50]Ow!
[34:53.40]And here's the best feature of the game.
[35:00.64]Hey!
[35:05.04]Wow.
[35:06.70]He's dead!
[35:23.89]He didn't see us.
[35:26.29]Oh no, it's the last, it's the last remnants of Wheatley's chest piece.
[35:44.48]What did that say?
[35:46.79]I need that tutorial.
[35:48.25]To mantle, push and hold while moving.
[35:57.96]Hello?
[36:08.57]Hello, hello, hello?
[36:11.15]Hello, stop.
[36:13.93]There was a phone on there.
[36:14.85]Hi.
[36:19.99]Too heavy.
[36:21.41]Holy shit, this is like 50 pounds.
[36:31.41]Oh, that's a secret entrance.
[36:35.17]Nope, it exploded.
[36:39.77]I'm fine, by the way.
[36:41.73]Let me get the tea.
[36:45.78]Okay.
[36:49.66]I promise I'm your grandmother.
[36:51.12]Russell.
[36:52.46]Russell.
[36:53.85]They've got Dad.
[36:55.28]I know.
[36:55.60]This, this is bad.
[36:57.80]They're gonna find out what he knows and then, yeah, they're gonna kill him.
[37:02.59]Oh, God.
[37:04.52]But the good news is we've got something they don't.
[37:08.28]Which is?
[37:09.62]My plan to get him back.
[37:11.14]Great.
[37:11.90]Let's hear it.
[37:13.04]Now, pretty soon they're going to realise that your dad is not going to talk.
[37:15.78]And when that happens, he's off to have his brain sucked out.
[37:18.20]Russell.
[37:19.01]Potentially.
[37:19.73]Maybe not, though.
[37:20.35]I mean, they could just drill into his... Oh, yeah.
[37:23.13]Still your dad.
[37:24.21]Right.
[37:24.41]Well, what they will do is take a train from here.
[37:28.23]This is Eli to Nova Prospect.
[37:32.23]And if he gets on that train...
[37:34.03]That's it, right?
[37:35.99]Not necessarily.
[37:37.21]Grab something that represents us.
[37:38.47]You have some cool computers in here, man.
[37:43.68]Grab something that represents us.
[37:53.68]A teacup?
[37:55.18]There's plenty of these around.
[37:56.46]Of course it's a teacup.
[37:58.23]Okay, that's you.
[37:59.31]Hey, it's us.
[38:00.03]I thought you said us.
[38:01.93]Well, one of us, me, will have to stay here for this plan to work.
[38:06.00]Alright, fair enough.
[38:07.82]Just outside, there's a second train that also leads out of City 17 through the quarantine zone.
[38:13.12]Okay.
[38:14.27]Both trains intersect here at Fairview Junction.
[38:17.05]I'm ready to go.
[38:18.47]Get there before his train and hack into the controls.
[38:21.59]That'll let me take over the system.
[38:23.61]Train comes to a halt, you deal with the combine situation, and we get your dad back.
[38:28.20]Sounds good.
[38:29.18]Where's the train I'm taking?
[38:30.94]Out the back, through the yard.
[38:32.14]Out the back, through the yard.
[38:32.86]It's decommissioned, but I think I can hack into its controls.
[38:36.08]Oh, and get yourself a pair of rustles on the way out.
[38:38.14]Anyone else feel like this is two people under a trench coat?
[38:40.35]The gloves, Alex.
[38:41.11]You know, the gravity gloves.
[38:42.71]I have a few sets through there.
[38:44.41]You can calibrate them out by the shed.
[38:46.57]Got it.
[38:47.49]We can do this, Alex.
[38:50.33]You got that, didn't you, when I said we could do it?
[38:52.37]Alright, here we go.
[38:53.59]Yeah, we are.
[38:54.51]Oh, yeah, this is like where you get the portal gun.
[39:03.11]Oh, shit.
[39:04.09]Oh, I...
[39:07.69]You guys take that up.
[39:09.05]I can't see that.
[39:15.24]You guys are in the way.
[39:16.86]It's alright.
[39:17.26]I'll do.
[39:19.68]Oops-a-daisy.
[39:20.52]What am I touching?
[39:21.48]Back up.
[39:23.92]Time to get a gun?
[39:39.09]Can't even get the light bulb, the game's not even good.
[39:43.61]Missed it, you missed it, you missed it.
[39:48.48]Missed something?
[39:48.96]Did I miss?
[39:55.50]I missed it.
[39:57.50]Oh well.
[39:57.74]I thought that was really the wall right next to me.
[40:04.21]It's the same color as the wall.
[40:05.93]I thought that was the wall in my house.
[40:07.94]Alright, you know how this goes.
[40:09.30]There should be a bunch of junk down there.
[40:11.18]Aim at something with your hand open.
[40:17.17]What?
[40:20.15]You're attached.
[40:21.03]Make a grip.
[40:29.85]Now target something with the rustles.
[40:33.40]Targeted.
[40:34.20]Close your hand.
[40:35.90]Registered.
[40:36.71]Now flick your wrist to bring it in.
[40:38.57]Catch.
[40:40.15]Try again.
[40:44.29]That's it.
[40:44.91]That's cool.
[40:46.01]One more time.
[40:48.46]Yep, you tethered.
[40:49.30]Make a grip.
[40:50.94]You've got it.
[40:51.68]Just a little flick of the wrist.
[40:53.10]Just like that.
[40:53.96]Perfect.
[40:54.42]We're done.
[40:55.26]Oh, oh, wait.
[40:56.64]I almost forgot.
[40:57.82]Alex, up here.
[40:58.42]You're going to need a gun.
[40:59.78]Don't worry, it's unloaded.
[41:03.48]It's unloaded now.
[41:08.85]I really could have used that bullet, Ted.
[41:12.27]Force push!
[41:16.96]Got it.
[41:17.40]Press button or pull slide to do it.
[41:24.90]How much ammo do I have?
[41:25.77]I have a lot of ammo?
[41:41.80]What do you want?
[41:42.18]What's the last thing he said?
[41:42.98]What happened?
[41:46.46]I got the gnome.
[41:52.99]Where?
[41:53.17]Oh, shit.
[41:54.39]Hold on.
[41:54.67]There's an herb here.
[41:55.33]Resident Evil told me I could eat these.
[41:57.45]Where's this gnome?
[42:11.78]What do you want to do?
[42:17.31]Where's my gun?
[42:21.95]How are you?
[42:25.83]How are you guys?
[42:26.33]Okay.
[42:27.99]Move cam top right.
[42:29.25]Let's see if I can do it.
[42:29.97]I can go.
[42:38.21]Got it.
[42:38.91]I got it.
[42:39.31]I actually got it.
[42:39.89]Well, okay.
[42:43.21]Okay, so what did he want me to do?
[42:46.03]Shoot in his window?
[42:48.13]What did he want me to do?
[42:51.32]Jump over this?
[42:56.56]Am I blind?
[43:06.95]Turn around.
[43:09.43]That, that, that, that, that, okay.
[43:10.89]I don't know what the gnome is, guys.
[43:21.71]Oh, you took care of that lock then.
[43:23.77]Good.
[43:24.35]Great.
[43:25.51]Did have the key for it, but should have given you that.
[43:28.40]More ammo in backpack.
[43:37.89]That didn't work.
[43:50.65]How do you reload?
[43:51.71]Oh, it's a load.
[43:52.47]It is a cool loading screen.
[44:10.71]It shows you the entire Sim City area.
[44:13.83]City Skylines, whatever.
[44:15.71]You think this city is better built than anything I build in City Skylines?
[44:18.67]Look at this.
[44:19.39]What's the traffic doing over there?
[44:22.07]What kind of roads are these looking at?
[44:23.29]Oh, curved roads?
[44:24.27]Oh, mega lull?
[44:24.97]Give me a break.
[44:25.83]And I get shit for how I design a city?
[44:31.60]Don't see the loading screen, no.
[44:41.75]I'm just... Here we go.
[45:17.68]That guy's going to stand up and he's going to... Ugh.
[45:20.14]Fuck, you can pick him up?
[45:21.06]Press to bring up jump indicator, or at least... One of these is going to stand up and I'm going to have to shoot it.
[45:50.67]I'll go that way.
[45:51.91]That looks dangerous.
[45:58.04]Wait!
[46:00.44]Ooh!
[46:02.24]That's... I'm not gonna be very good at that.
[46:03.70]Search the environment for useful items.
[46:16.25]Ooh, what's this?
[46:18.23]Ah, would you look at that.
[46:19.87]Risen.
[46:20.62]And if there's resin around here, there should be a combine fabricator.
[46:24.08]Keep an eye out.
[46:24.80]We might be able to upgrade your firepower a bit.
[46:27.22]Really?
[46:27.48]This upgrades?
[46:30.40]Wait, was I supposed to wait for somebody?
[46:35.71]Keyblots do not enter.
[46:44.80]Alright, I know something's gonna fucking jump out.
[46:46.93]They don't give you the gun, and when the guy comes in, the one enemy you have to kill.
[46:50.29]Huh.
[46:55.82]I think I can reroute this with my multi-tool.
[46:58.32]You what?
[46:59.44]It's a tool with multiple functions.
[47:01.20]So, you know, multi-tool.
[47:05.31]Oh, it's... Okay.
[47:07.41]Use multi-tool.
[47:13.53]It's cool!
[47:14.65]Alright, did I just turn the power on?
[47:15.65]Can I not do it long enough?
[47:21.71]Hold on.
[47:27.94]Oh, it's a puzzle gameplay!
[47:29.34]Alex, that thing's incredible.
[47:30.88]You need an incredible brand name.
[47:32.80]Something that really sells it.
[47:34.44]Who am I gonna sell it to?
[47:35.92]The Combine's not going to be here forever.
[47:37.98]You should be thinking about the future, Alex.
[47:40.17]Well, how about I call it the Alex?
[47:43.97]It's a little derivative of the Russells, but yeah, provisionally, sure.
[47:49.29]The Alex.
[47:50.89]Yeah.
[47:53.00]Sweaty ears.
[47:53.62]So I got to route the power from here.
[48:04.08]Oh, just like in Saw.
[48:09.12]Fucking saw.
[48:11.06]Why is it?
[48:11.78]Wait, what just happened?
[48:15.15]That wasn't safe.
[48:16.75]Good.
[48:39.74]Did you get a flashlight?
[48:40.52]You have to quickly switch to and from your hand.
[48:50.38]Pick up heavy objects with both hands.
[49:05.24]Don't touch everything.
[49:06.36]I'm touching every single object in the whole game world.
[49:17.65]These things are in the game?
[49:18.83]Oh, I hated these in Half-Life.
[49:41.06]Watch out don't touch that
[50:09.96]I haven't moved in there.
[50:12.48]Oh, shit.
[50:20.88]Come here, come here, come here.
[50:24.10]I need you.
[50:25.44]I need you for a minute.
[50:31.21]Get it!
[50:31.67]Did you get it?
[50:33.17]He doesn't want it.
[50:34.03]He's like, ew, gross, that's a dead body, dude.
[50:46.96]Get him!
[50:57.20]What are you holding on to?
[50:58.66]Let go of that!
[50:59.48]Put it down.
[51:01.77]Take him!
[51:03.83]Take him!
[51:04.49]Take it!
[51:06.81]Come on!
[51:07.35]I'm about to, like, throw this guy out of the bar.
[51:15.45]Oh, god damn it.
[51:24.18]What happened?
[51:26.77]What's going on?
[51:31.67]Where am I?
[51:32.47]I didn't know what, I just see like a sun setting.
[51:42.00]I think I'm in the ceiling.
[51:54.24]You're out of the play zone.
[52:06.03]I got eaten?
[52:07.05]That doesn't make any sense.
[52:15.22]Yeah, I got eaten by the barnacle, but I mean, did I touch it and then just get sucked straight up?
[52:25.08]How'd you meet my dad, anyway?
[52:35.76]You guys worked together at Black Mesa, right?
[52:38.10]Yeah.
[52:38.46]Well, no.
[52:39.64]Tricky place to get a job, actually.
[52:41.58]I interviewed at Black Mesa.
[52:42.82]They did try again in a year.
[52:44.60]Shit, I need that!
[52:45.86]I need that!
[52:49.23]Honestly, it's a miracle you and your dad got out of there.
[53:14.04]This is the worst ride at Disney World.
[53:20.55]I need to reset it.
[53:21.99]I need those things.
[53:25.15]I sucked one of those upgrade stones into the thing's head and it destroyed it.
[53:29.15]I need that thing.
[53:34.54]I don't want to shoot it because that's a waste of money.
[53:36.60]That's a waste of ammo.
[53:54.61]Okay, I'm ready.
[53:55.03]Alright, I'm not gonna fuck this up.
[54:24.57]Oh shit, I didn't... I have to shoot them.
[54:36.41]What?
[54:36.89]Fuck!
[54:38.05]Give me that.
[54:40.43]Don't touch anything!
[54:43.04]I missed the resin?
[54:44.12]What?
[54:44.40]No I didn't!
[54:45.20]Where?
[54:45.70]Where's that resin?
[54:52.52]Oh, the right!
[54:59.09]Alright, we're good.
[55:04.19]Okay, here we go.
[55:07.35]Ready?
[55:08.81]What the fuck?
[55:12.49]Ah!
[55:13.69]Can I get in here?
[55:24.60]No, wrong fucking guy!
[55:26.24]Should I shoot?
[55:27.00]Kill it?
[55:46.87]How do I reload the gun?
[55:49.61]Through the next left.
[55:50.53]Let's go!
[56:11.86]Finally.
[56:12.32]Nuke fired.
[56:25.39]Quiet.
[56:26.09]I mean, it is quiet.
[56:26.97]I'm gonna get ambushed.
[56:28.47]How many do I have in this gun?
[56:30.86]Six.
[56:31.38]I take it the quarantine zone is behind this hatch?
[56:34.20]Yeah.
[56:34.62]Yeah, that's where they keep it.
[56:36.54]I'll look around for a control panel to open it.
[56:38.90]Oh, no.
[56:39.41]No control panel.
[56:40.69]Just shoot that thing and it'll go, ding!
[56:42.65]It'll turn to green.
[56:46.89]I mean, it was worth a shot.
[56:54.67]Didn't even know I was back there.
[56:57.10]Here we go.
[57:14.21]I can't wait to upgrade.
[57:15.05]This is going to be so much fun.
[57:16.63]What about anything over here?
[57:24.57]If I was the Combine, where would I put a control panel?
[57:28.44]Ow.
[57:28.78]Does that hurt?
[57:37.92]Is shit in here?
[57:41.82]Yep.
[57:42.14]Yeah, these things are everywhere.
[57:47.00]This is like an Easter egg hunt.
[57:49.90]This is awesome.
[57:50.44]Can I go in?
[58:14.12]I hear a bug.
[58:20.64]Why am I looking in the toilet?
[58:21.93]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[58:23.61]I thought that was gonna be a resin stone.
[58:25.25]Nice.
[58:31.15]I got a lot of these.
[58:37.21]Shit, my face is itchy.
[58:38.45]That's a bad sign.
[58:39.27]Alright, can I just, like... Is this how, like, the speedrunners do this game?
[58:44.13]Okay.
[58:51.56]We're looking for a control panel.
[58:53.60]That's it right there, isn't it?
[58:57.44]Climb this.
[58:57.88]Control panel.
[59:04.52]Wait, wait, wait!
[59:05.08]I have a tool!
[59:06.87]Alright.
[59:10.30]I feel like struck by lightning doing this.
[59:13.52]This is like a Chevy Chase movie.
[59:16.00]Oh, I got it.
[59:16.64]I'm just trying to get a signal.
[59:19.28]Yikes.
[59:21.76]Where do I have to, what do I do?
[59:23.85]That up there?
[59:27.55]Harry Potter joke incoming.
[59:29.83]Why, what do you mean, Harry, why?
[59:33.10]That's a control panel right here.
[59:35.64]This is electricity right here.
[59:39.36]It's an electricity panel.
[59:40.14]What the hell is this?
[59:59.68]Look with your special eyes.
[60:03.41]Aren't I doing that?
[60:05.61]This is definitely a control panel.
[60:07.83]Like, absolutely.
[60:09.69]It has a handle on it.
[60:10.59]Shit, look, it's got a handle on it.
[60:14.02]Am I dead?
[60:15.80]Follow the wire.
[60:28.91]I think I may have found it.
[60:51.11]Oh, you grabbed me, Resident Evil game.
[60:53.07]Thank you.
[61:14.66]Oh, there.
[61:15.28]Wait, I can climb in the window.
[61:17.72]Oh.
[61:20.43]Ugh.
[61:21.27]Alive?
[61:21.59]Was it?
[61:21.83]Oh, that's me making that noise.
[61:23.05]Come here.
[61:23.63]I need this window, dude.
[61:26.93]One minute.
[61:27.75]Stay right there.
[61:30.31]And before your very eyes, I'm going to take the dollar out of your pocket and put it in your girlfriend's.
[61:37.46]Can you believe it?
[61:38.34]Street magic with Jerma985.
[61:39.88]Come here.
[61:45.04]I'll get it, sir.
[61:59.17]Not what I was supposed to do?
[61:59.97]Fuck.
[62:05.90]Did I just push it?
[62:13.27]Ah!
[62:15.33]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, I can use this.
[62:33.80]A lot of shit in here.
[62:34.38]Okay.
[62:43.25]Right here?
[62:43.73]Yeah.
[62:43.95]Look at that.
[62:50.29]Oh, cigarette.
[62:51.03]Get rid of it.
[62:53.97]Okay, if you put it, like, into your mouth, it just goes right in.
[62:57.89]Really important.
[63:05.13]I'm running ahead with an ashtray.
[63:06.07]Alright, control panel, wait.
[63:18.02]There.
[63:22.92]Okay, uh... Probably something I can turn on in there, right?
[63:26.51]There's something I can turn on over there.
[63:27.69]Okay.
[63:38.58]That's the control panel.
[63:39.85]They've probably scrambled the circuit.
[63:41.69]But considering no one would be dumb enough to open the hatch, it shouldn't be too hard to put back.
[63:45.57]Okay, wait.
[63:48.31]How much health do I have?
[63:50.59]I got full health.
[63:51.15]I don't need that.
[63:51.57]Okay, let's go.
[63:56.25]Oops.
[63:56.90]Who are you?
[63:58.98]What's that?
[64:00.62]Okay, multi-tool.
[64:11.05]Come on.
[64:25.04]Oh, okay.
[64:26.30]I need to put a device in here?
[64:29.18]Yeah, I need to put a tube in there.
[64:31.60]How's that?
[64:35.23]Is that a good tube?
[64:40.08]Alright, what's that?
[64:54.87]Did I just explode?
[64:58.87]Is that to put?
[65:12.98]Uh... Where does it want me to go?
[65:22.65]Um... I don't understand which one it goes in.
[65:28.03]How do I tell?
[65:28.49]Can I tell?
[65:29.57]Do I get, like, a thing that tells me?
[65:33.61]Oh.
[65:41.87]Can I get an emergency thing?
[65:43.05]Is that in the game?
[65:44.92]Oh, shit.
[65:45.82]That's an Amber Alert.
[65:46.86]Hold on, let me look at this for a sec.
[65:49.76]It's not around here.
[66:14.92]I thought that was in the game.
[66:16.06]I was like, why we get, that's like the, hold on, I was like, that's the complete, the mission sound?
[66:20.91]Yeah, it's in Utah, apparently.
[66:36.70]Jesus Christ.
[66:44.07]Hold on, this is, hold on.
[66:45.07]Actually, I'm going to take this opportunity to pee, and this is so fogged up in here.
[66:50.16]I've been playing for a fucking hour?
[66:51.70]It's been like ten minutes!
[66:58.69]Holy shit, I must be having a lot of fun.
[67:00.39]Alright, let me go get a water, and let me just clean this out.
[67:03.73]I'll be right back.
[67:38.61]Thank you.
[69:40.63]Okay, I'm back.
[69:44.96]Worst part about VR is you get so sweaty in this thing that I almost wish there was a way to make it so you didn't fog up the lenses every 40 minutes.
[69:55.84]Wait, you guys counting?
[70:02.39]Spectator smoothing.
[70:05.13]The spectator smoothing is on high.
[70:10.05]I have it on.
[70:10.55]I have it set to the highest setting.
[70:21.34]I'm out right now, so... Are we good?
[70:25.58]Let me just do a check here.
[70:26.63]Are we good?
[70:36.19]Are we good?
[70:36.71]It's alright?
[70:39.34]I'm making sure because when I'm in there, it's kind of hard to, you know, you get in VR and you can't even tell what the fuck's going on.
[70:46.38]Turn up the sub, turn, should I turn, how are the subtitles?
[70:49.74]Oh, I don't see that on the screen.
[70:51.12]That would be awesome if I could see how much health and, I'm going to have to ask you guys these things because I don't even see that shit.
[70:55.36]Alright, I'm going back in.
[70:58.10]Subtitles are good?
[71:03.49]Alright.
[71:05.57]Yeah, it's on my hand, but chat is on that hand too, so when I see how much health I have, I see you guys spamming like omega lulz.
[71:19.32]Move it.
[71:20.18]No, I can't.
[71:20.56]It has to be on my left hand.
[71:24.06]My right hand is my shooting hand.
[71:25.59]I can't be like in the middle of shooting and be like, hey guys, hey, hold on a minute.
[71:29.37]What are you saying?
[71:30.59]No, it's not going to happen.
[71:34.36]That's better.
[71:35.62]Better, better, better.
[71:37.46]Oh boy, it's starting to crush my eyes.
[71:39.24]Alright, let's go.
[71:43.10]We're good.
[71:45.46]I've had some water.
[71:47.32]Ready to go.
[71:47.75]On my eyeballs.
[71:51.63]Look at it.
[71:57.51]Okay, we're good.
[72:08.52]Oh, there it is!
[72:08.98]There's the power thing!
[72:10.65]Oh, sick!
[72:21.27]What am I, like 60-70% of the way through the game?
[72:23.65]Maybe 80% of the way through the game?
[72:25.91]That's pretty good so far.
[72:50.46]I didn't do anything?
[72:55.50]Ugh, what's in there?
[72:56.12]Oh, there's like guts in here.
[73:02.14]Ugh!
[73:03.74]Oh!
[73:04.96]Oh, don't!
[73:05.50]No!
[73:05.82]Get him out of there!
[73:07.14]Oh no, he's like part of it.
[73:09.54]Part of it.
[73:09.98]He's gonna get... No, the poor rat.
[73:16.59]The hell?
[73:24.36]Ugh.
[73:26.25]How do we get him out of there?
[73:30.43]I see it.
[73:32.65]Whoa.
[73:34.21]It's the Inception sound.
[73:35.60]That's the Inception music.
[73:36.92]What happened?
[73:42.23]Finally, I'm gonna head in how far is Fairview Junction?
[73:46.23]You'll go through the old subway tunnels on your way to the train yard Have they started leaving dad yet?
[73:51.74]I don't think so.
[73:52.16]Which is good news because we're still on time Great or bad news because they've already killed him and you don't need to move and corpse.
[74:01.02]You just bury it or burn it Still there Alex.
[74:05.82]Yeah I get on me every five minutes
[74:13.34]Get that gun out.
[74:14.16]I feel like there's gonna be trouble.
[74:19.27]Load it.
[74:25.63]What the fuck is this?
[74:41.45]Alright.
[74:43.37]Here we go.
[74:45.35]So can I take that?
[74:46.13]Fucking cord.
[74:52.74]It's so annoying.
[75:02.05]Whoa.
[75:17.08]so I tried to shoot the alien whatever problem I haven't seen any resin for a little while why not oh alright next part of the game
[75:45.58]I missed tons of resin.
[75:47.32]Been at the same bit for 20 minutes.
[75:52.79]I took a break too.
[75:56.13]That's gonna explode.
[75:57.13]That's gonna explode.
[75:58.71]That's an explosive barrel.
[76:00.08]It's gonna blow up.
[76:00.78]Yeah, it doesn't work every time.
[76:10.62]This.
[76:12.00]I just found a loose syringe of God knows what.
[76:14.16]Is this medicine?
[76:15.48]Does it have a skull and crossbones on it?
[76:19.52]I don't see one.
[76:21.06]It's an adrenaline shot.
[76:22.33]Probably medicine then.
[76:26.89]Back in like 2004 when this was ridiculous.
[76:32.53]God, how we've gone so far.
[76:35.26]Back in 2004, this was like showing the movie of the train to the people in the 1800s.
[76:39.64]They thought they were going to get hit by the fucking train.
[76:43.17]The first movie ever, when everyone in the audience was like, the train's gonna hit us!
[76:47.33]That was 2004 with the first physics-based game.
[76:55.12]Is there a... This is gonna explode.
[76:58.56]So I need to be careful.
[76:59.28]Wait, resin, search.
[77:00.28]Resin, check.
[77:03.33]Any resin?
[77:06.97]No, don't.
[77:07.85]That's stupid.
[77:13.81]The old prospector.
[77:15.25]Don't go near that one.
[77:17.34]Let me see.
[77:18.32]I've got a lantern here.
[77:19.44]Let's see if I can see where the gold is.
[77:21.36]Get that fucking guy away from us.
[77:24.09]Don't do that.
[77:25.39]Get the old man out of here.
[77:43.79]I changed my mind.
[77:44.35]I want it.
[77:44.71]I changed my mind.
[77:49.23]Oh, okay.
[77:50.55]Let's take a look and see.
[77:51.59]Ooh, be careful.
[77:54.40]I heard there were monsters down here.
[77:58.32]Oops.
[78:01.94]I can't hold it.
[78:04.91]What happened?
[78:05.39]Did I screenshot and leaked?
[78:07.43]What does it say?
[78:18.12]Oh, it's one of these guys.
[78:20.53]I heard they will suck on your brain.
[78:23.41]Eat this, motherfucker.
[78:30.46]Oh, it didn't go far enough.
[78:38.48]Oh, shit, I missed.
[78:49.57]I could have had him just suck it up.
[78:51.07]Fuck it, fuck it, fuck it.
[79:22.91]I got it.
[79:28.91]Clock it.
[79:29.55]Clock it.
[79:29.97]Yeah, clock it!
[79:37.42]Alright, I get it.
[79:40.08]Oh, quick!
[79:42.22]Yeah, I got it.
[79:54.92]Uh, check for resin.
[79:57.04]I haven't gotten any resin.
[79:57.96]I'm terrible.
[79:58.50]At least resin.
[80:11.06]Am I this bad at the game or am I not seeing any?
[80:18.78]What's a gas mask?
[80:19.49]Can I put it on?
[80:22.48]I did, holy shit, I didn't even know you could do that.
[80:26.50]I just said alley-oop to that end of the wall.
[80:30.88]What the, I heard a noise, I heard a noise, somebody heard a noise.
[80:32.50]Oh, this is a Ghostbusters thing.
[80:43.49]We got one!
[80:44.21]Do I actually need that though?
[81:04.19]Oh shit, alright, good.
[81:05.35]Oh, what's the point of doing that?
[81:10.17]Just go like this.
[81:14.08]Okay.
[81:15.04]This is fun.
[81:18.98]Can you do it to the skull?
[81:23.16]Oh, get the hat.
[81:41.48]I don't need a hat.
[81:42.12]I have nine resins.
[81:53.08]Is that good?
[81:54.04]How much ammo is in this?
[81:57.48]How can you tell how much bullets?
[82:01.56]It's weight.
[82:13.43]Look, bud.
[82:25.80]Like this.
[82:29.38]How am I going to let this mean Hubbard try to get over here and try to shoot me?
[82:37.05]Answer me.
[82:46.96]Oh, smash it in.
[83:47.64]Lock it.
[83:48.98]The head.
[83:49.40]You think I'm aiming for his, like, toes?
[83:51.90]I have 90 ammo, are you serious?
[84:00.16]Why am I trying so hard to not waste it?
[84:04.50]Ace, what's in it?
[84:10.99]Oh, there's a lock on it?
[84:15.35]Oh, it's a Samsonite.
[84:17.17]Of course it's that.
[84:18.11]Of course it's impossible to get into.
[84:19.47]It's a Samsonite.
[84:23.03]Watch out for that guy.
[84:37.94]I, like, could pick him up and pretend to be an alien.
[84:57.06]Oh, shit.
[84:59.96]Oh, man.
[85:00.97]Man, I don't want to do it, man.
[85:02.49]Oh, come on, man.
[85:04.11]I don't want to do it.
[85:29.59]How much ammo is in this?
[85:31.27]Six.
[85:32.39]Whoops.
[85:33.53]This is fun.
[85:39.78]This is fun as fuck.
[85:41.26]What is that?
[85:46.20]Is this a coffin?
[85:49.84]Okay, how about a...
[85:56.63]Will it work on the Russells?
[85:58.07]No, but it should fix up that pistol nicely.
[86:00.43]Good thing, too.
[86:01.25]I gave you one of my lesser guns.
[86:02.73]Resin?
[86:03.45]Thanks, Russell.
[86:04.79]Well, you know, in case it doesn't make a sack.
[86:06.56]Resin?
[86:06.68]I'll tell you what, Russell.
[86:07.90]Oh, resin.
[86:08.86]If I die, I do.
[86:09.74]Come on, there's got to be resin in here somewhere.
[86:11.36]I'll use a gun anyway.
[86:12.44]That wasn't a gift.
[86:13.74]That's my gun.
[86:15.38]Come on, man.
[86:16.04]It's got to be resin.
[86:16.84]Not resin, but alright, it'll do.
[86:37.17]Wait, this probably resident this like old grandmother's attic box.
[86:42.27]I knew it.
[86:44.17]Aha!
[86:46.22]Any more?
[87:01.94]glove on.
[87:02.90]Can I open this?
[87:03.44]Fun.
[87:08.77]Very fun.
[87:09.37]Wait a minute.
[87:09.77]Over here.
[87:14.01]Batteries?
[87:18.27]Resin?
[87:20.73]I'm a resin boy right now.
[87:22.16]Alright.
[87:24.06]I think I got it.
[87:24.58]I'm good to go.
[87:25.30]Please take the hat off.
[87:34.29]It's only the hat?
[87:38.38]Okay, so.
[87:49.67]Get over here.
[87:50.19]Oh, I get it, I get it, I get it.
[87:58.39]You gotta have this line goes through everything.
[88:18.76]I got it.
[88:19.20]Give me one second.
[88:25.58]It takes a second to figure out a puzzle.
[88:34.66]Oh man, oh man, oh man, oh man.
[88:37.67]Oh man, oh man, oh man.
[88:39.89]Oh yeah, this is cool.
[88:41.67]Reflex site, or should I hold the laser site reflex site?
[88:49.46]And I might as well.
[88:59.35]I always feel like this whenever you go to a store and they have the iPad that you have to sign and touch.
[89:04.07]I'm always like, I don't want to touch this screen, man.
[89:07.90]Reflex sucks.
[89:10.86]It's terrible.
[89:11.76]Is it?
[89:14.02]Whatever, I'm good.
[89:15.20]Insert resin.
[89:21.56]Oh.
[89:24.28]How do I insert resin?
[89:38.28]Reflex this ass.
[89:39.22]It's alright.
[89:42.80]Looks pretty cool.
[89:43.30]What are you talking about?
[89:45.72]Wait, so that circle is now my crosshair.
[89:53.42]How does that suck?
[89:54.06]That's sick.
[89:58.34]Who's his head so much?
[90:00.66]I mean, am I moving my head too much?
[90:09.41]Fun guy.
[90:14.36]F smoothing on high.
[90:15.34]Alright, let's heal.
[90:25.57]Oh, I can see the dot.
[90:29.97]Oh, this is actually going to be fucking kind of hard to use.
[90:32.95]I get it now.
[90:39.57]Stop hurting them.
[90:40.21]Alright, I'm good.
[90:46.29]I've got my reflex sight.
[90:47.39]I've got my ready-to-go sight.
[90:49.25]I've got my resin, but it's alright.
[90:51.99]There's tons of resin in the game.
[90:53.17]Try it out.
[91:00.54]Oh my god!
[91:03.66]Lock it!
[91:13.83]It actually, I, I, it doesn't, it's actually kinda good.
[91:15.83]I don't hate it.
[91:22.42]How did I do that?
[91:46.50]I like it!
[91:48.60]Two shots were good.
[91:52.60]Actually, it highlights the head.
[91:55.83]Yep.
[91:57.51]See?
[91:59.27]You guys see what I'm saying, right?
[92:14.42]Oh my god, I thought it was gonna explode.
[92:25.27]Hit that and... Nobody?
[92:29.73]Nobody.
[92:31.81]Get outta here.
[92:56.76]It's not bad.
[92:59.72]What?
[93:01.86]I didn't know you could do... Somebody came in the door.
[93:09.65]You know, that's not... I guess you can do that.
[93:14.87]Alright, uh, resin search, please.
[93:19.15]Thank you.
[93:19.51]Resin search, thank you.
[93:33.54]Eh?
[93:34.38]The fuck is this?
[93:59.16]Oh my god, Resident Evil 4 taught me so well!
[94:13.51]Don't want ammo.
[94:18.42]I got plenty.
[94:21.22]Any complainers?
[94:22.06]Jeremiah Walk, any complainers?
[94:27.63]Five minutes you play.
[94:28.53]Guys, something that you guys have to remember is Resident Evil 4 was the original GTA 5.
[94:37.75]What I mean by that is they came out with the game.
[94:40.78]They've re-released it like eight times.
[94:43.85]This is like before Skyrim did this.
[94:45.53]This is before Resident Evil 5.
[94:47.09]I mean, before GTA 5 did this.
[94:49.51]They released it on like 12 different consoles.
[94:51.43]I've played through it like four times.
[94:53.07]Why are you talking about releases?
[95:06.32]Somebody just said I've never played... Somebody said I've played four minutes of Resident Evil 4.
[95:10.40]They don't understand.
[95:21.99]Hey!
[95:22.73]Hey!
[95:22.91]I see it.
[95:23.46]Hit the what?
[95:25.38]What did he say?
[95:26.00]Shoot the what?
[95:26.82]Hit the lamp?
[95:33.38]Something's gonna come.
[95:49.51]I hear it.
[95:51.61]I hear this motherfucker up in that vent.
[95:55.09]I'm telling you, I heard him in the vent.
[95:56.11]He's in the vent.
[95:58.88]I know he's in the vent.
[95:59.62]I know he is.
[96:00.62]I know you're in that fucking vent.
[96:01.68]I'm gonna rip around and I'm gonna shoot.
[96:14.80]I see him!
[96:20.35]Fuck, I hate those things.
[96:22.27]Oh, dude!
[96:32.03]Dude, he just bent it!
[96:33.16]Alright.
[96:36.68]Can I ask a question?
[96:38.56]Why do I continue to make Among Us references when I've never played the game?
[96:42.74]What's wrong with me?
[96:46.45]I don't even play that game.
[96:48.77]Why do I keep doing that?
[96:50.09]I don't even watch it.
[96:51.17]I don't even care.
[96:52.15]I'm never going to play it.
[96:54.41]I don't get it.
[96:55.52]How do I know all this?
[96:56.50]I need to stay relevant.
[97:00.42]I'm not even trying to.
[97:01.98]It's just for some reason... I'm just talking about it all the time.
[97:07.34]I talk about Among Us more than I make WoW references at this point.
[97:10.13]That's how you know there's a problem.
[97:24.48]Like, oh dude, he vented!
[97:25.66]Half of you guys probably don't even watch that fucking game.
[97:29.73]Like, you probably don't even know what I'm talking about.
[97:31.35]I know half of you have played WoW.
[97:44.30]Untrue, untrue.
[97:45.62]No, come on.
[97:46.90]Everybody's played WoW.
[97:49.82]At some point in their life.
[97:50.84]Even if you got, like, the get to level 10 trial and said, this game sucks, I'm never playing it again.
[97:56.69]Get pissed off at your friend that introduced you to it.
[97:58.75]Be like, dude, fuck it, I'm not playing this stupid game.
[98:05.97]Level 20, whatever.
[98:08.35]Heard anything about Dad, Russell?
[98:10.51]No.
[98:10.75]Radio silence since he got on the train.
[98:12.89]Damn it.
[98:15.04]Well, the good news is he's probably fine.
[98:17.68]How do you know that?
[98:21.52]Oh, shit.
[98:22.52]Please!
[98:23.22]Yo, what's up?
[98:23.84]What do I have?
[98:24.88]When did I get hit?
[98:55.81]I need a thing over there.
[99:14.44]I need to make a new indentation on my face.
[99:16.54]There we go.
[99:17.40]That's better.
[99:27.11]Get this shit out of me.
[99:31.39]That's him.
[99:33.29]That's him.
[99:35.94]That's him.
[99:36.22]Get in.
[99:48.23]Nice, OK.
[99:52.99]Probably resin in here.
[100:01.43]I have to try this.
[100:01.89]Professor?
[100:20.09]How do you know all this?
[100:21.42]I'm reading it here on my computer.
[100:22.80]I downloaded the internet before the war.
[100:24.86]You downloaded the entire internet?
[100:26.72]Yeah, most of it.
[100:28.56]That's Tim and Eric.
[100:29.88]Got the whole internet on this one CD.
[100:33.08]That's one of the best bits.
[100:34.46]One of the best skits of any comedy television show is the internet on the CD bit that Tim and Eric did.
[100:41.75]That's one of the best.
[100:50.42]Ah, there we go.
[101:05.25]Lost it all options.
[101:07.99]Wait a minute, hold on.
[101:15.72]Heal.
[101:25.66]A healer.
[101:36.42]A healer.
[101:41.00]No, it's somewhere.
[101:41.60]What did I do with it?
[101:58.40]What?
[101:59.10]What the fuck?
[101:59.60]What do you mean, what the fuck?
[102:02.06]What do you mean, what the fuck?
[102:02.92]What's wrong?
[102:03.26]I need a new face after this.
[102:08.54]Okay, let's go.
[102:18.57]I got Ultra Reset Instinct.
[102:42.67]What the hell is that?
[102:46.25]What's going on?
[102:46.67]Is this electricity or what?
[102:47.73]What is this?
[102:48.11]Can I walk into that?
[102:52.23]Wait a minute.
[102:52.59]Hold on.
[102:52.87]I'm going to throw something in there and see what happens.
[103:03.46]It's safe.
[103:04.04]It's an eye.
[103:04.88]Garbage?
[103:09.51]Oh, come on.
[103:10.90]I don't- this is why I can't play Luigi's Mansion.
[103:13.94]Fuck.
[103:14.12]Sorry.
[103:43.74]A-ha!
[103:44.18]A-ha!
[103:45.22]A-ha!
[103:50.69]Hey.
[104:03.23]Oh.
[104:03.69]Resident anywhere else?
[104:18.33]Alright, let's go.
[104:25.91]Alright, I made it out.
[104:33.36]I have to press the series of buttons?
[104:38.74]Oh, I'm so glad to be outside.
[104:40.06]Come on.
[104:45.70]Oh.
[104:47.72]Is this like Kinect 4?
[105:16.12]Calling it now, he's going to hit the two correct ones accidentally.
[105:20.65]I don't know what makes them correct.
[105:23.35]One of these is the right combo.
[105:45.52]Going anywhere?
[105:46.06]What is that?
[105:47.82]Oh, wait.
[105:48.67]There, over there.
[105:49.25]This is just the thing that's in the doctor's office to keep your child occupied.
[105:54.85]It'll say it right here.
[106:05.80]Fuck.
[106:06.46]Fuck.
[106:13.58]Look!
[106:14.26]Look at that!
[106:15.26]Would you look at that?
[106:18.08]There's a lot of them.
[106:19.30]Which one's the right one?
[106:22.94]Oh.
[106:25.56]Any of these.
[106:25.98]Do I have to try them all?
[106:32.78]Alright, it's...
[106:45.01]That one and that one.
[106:49.31]Second row three, fourth row two.
[106:52.72]Second row three, fourth row two.
[106:54.08]What?
[107:03.62]Write every single one.
[107:05.13]This one.
[107:09.65]Hey!
[107:10.77]I told you guys I'd get it.
[107:15.63]I think this mask in here has been worn down so raw that I'm getting hit with plastic just digging into my face.
[107:22.34]I'm gonna have to replace it.
[107:25.50]I'd be a waste, but I don't care.
[107:47.86]Big game with a brick, I gotta try.
[107:53.04]Ooh, bricks.
[107:57.12]Fucking make fire on somebody's head.
[108:06.73]Can I crush somebody's head?
[108:10.59]Alex, you alright?
[108:11.85]What's wrong?
[108:13.05]I'm fine, Russell.
[108:14.29]What's up?
[108:18.28]I'm fine.
[108:18.84]I'll see you in a minute.
[108:22.82]Just get me a large.
[108:24.08]Get me a large steak and cheese.
[108:25.30]That's all I need.
[108:30.44]What did I have to say that for?
[108:32.22]Why did I say that?
[108:32.80]God damn it.
[108:35.02]Now I want a large steak and cheese.
[108:36.60]Like, so bad right now.
[108:38.96]Why did I do that?
[108:41.24]What the fuck is wrong with me?
[108:56.02]I can't fucking imagine.
[108:57.08]That would hurt so much.
[109:04.30]I'm ready to pancake somebody's head.
[109:05.84]Uh, alright.
[109:26.61]Whoa.
[109:28.25]This is weird.
[109:36.80]Ring the doorbell?
[109:56.74]Okay, thanks.
[109:58.18]You are welcome.
[110:02.16]So, what's a Vortigaunt doing here?
[110:07.94]Cooking.
[110:09.50]Right, but I mean, in general.
[110:11.18]I do too, too.
[110:14.04]I have a brain injury.
[110:16.02]Oh, I'm sorry to... My brain is injured.
[110:18.74]That's terrible, and I hope... Look, I'm actually pretty busy looking for my father.
[110:23.43]V...
[110:25.93]Eli Vance.
[110:26.75]Eli Vance, yes.
[110:30.00]The Combine have him, and I really do need to get moving.
[110:32.60]The Combine, yes.
[110:35.80]Do not go yet.
[110:37.36]I will show you something.
[110:38.88]Look, I appreciate it.
[110:40.36]This way.
[110:40.88]I can't stick around.
[110:41.70]It's so scary.
[110:42.33]It is important.
[110:44.27]I know, I'm sure it is.
[110:45.33]The Alex Vance must go this way anyway.
[110:51.47]These guys are so cool.
[110:52.47]Uh-oh.
[111:03.60]I want some.
[111:05.32]Oh, he's the one doing the spells.
[111:06.44]Hold on.
[111:06.82]Wait.
[111:07.00]I'm missing lore.
[111:10.49]Come on.
[111:18.42]Come on.
[111:22.70]The Combine and other Criken.
[111:35.82]Hey, like the Eli Vance, the Alex Vance will be there.
[111:44.70]I would help.
[111:45.93]I really would, but the Alex Vance is honestly very busy saving her dad.
[111:52.75]You will not save him.
[111:54.43]He is dead.
[111:55.83]What?
[111:56.67]Or he will be.
[111:58.91]Is or will be?
[112:00.25]What?
[112:01.04]It is a matter of perspective.
[112:03.99]But Alex Vance alone cannot prevent his fate.
[112:08.14]I... Look, thank you for everything, but I really have to go.
[112:14.70]I'm sorry, but I really don't have time for riddles.
[112:16.98]Oh, no riddles.
[112:18.74]The combine drilled here.
[112:21.92]I am severed from the vortices.
[112:25.24]I am alone in my head.
[112:30.31]I'm sorry.
[112:33.77]Look, if I can, if I run across your friends, I will see what I can do.
[112:40.33]You have saved my king.
[112:43.13]I haven't.
[112:44.79]Then you will.
[112:51.11]Courage, Alex Vance.
[112:54.93]Resin!
[112:58.15]Resin over here.
[113:00.59]Oh, no, I got...
[113:07.14]You must go.
[113:08.10]Resin?
[113:10.70]You've resin, you're baiting people with resin over here.
[113:16.68]It's probably right there.
[113:17.31]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[113:17.97]I think I see some resin.
[113:22.37]Your mission begins.
[113:24.65]What?
[113:25.01]There might be, come down.
[113:28.91]He's gonna suck it in the back of the head.
[113:33.09]Whatever, I probably missed the resin.
[113:37.23]I'm a fucking maniac.
[113:39.43]Just go, Omega Lull.
[113:41.93]Tell me you didn't get baited from the resin over there.
[113:50.46]Oh, he's the one doing this shit.
[113:57.01]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[114:01.31]Here we go!
[114:02.99]Why?
[114:03.91]Okay.
[114:05.79]Thanks.
[114:06.91]Are you done helping?
[114:08.13]No, I don't... Wait, why not eat those?
[114:12.81]Why is that such a big deal?
[114:16.07]Eat those.
[114:16.35]Why is that such a problem?
[114:35.73]They're probably just protein and shit.
[114:39.95]Why not just eat them?
[114:41.98]I don't know.
[114:42.98]Test it for, like, diseases.
[114:56.33]Let's go.
[115:02.07]Mind you.
[115:09.50]Why don't you just eat slugs and rice?
[115:12.28]Well, here's the difference.
[115:14.36]I would eat like slugs and bugs and shit if that was the only source of real food that was still around.
[115:23.89]There's only so many cans of Chef Boyardee ravioli mini raviolis that exist.
[115:28.37]Once those are gone, they're gone.
[115:29.63]And then you have to deal with whatever the fuck you have to deal with.
[115:34.43]Is it or will it be?
[115:37.86]Alex!
[115:38.66]Alex, the signal's back.
[115:39.88]Can you hear me?
[115:40.62]Are you okay?
[115:41.52]Russell, I'm good.
[115:43.38]How's Dad?
[115:44.46]They've got him on the train.
[115:45.54]He's on the move.
[115:46.48]You've got to find Seaview Junction before they get there.
[115:49.23]I'm working on it.
[115:50.39]Alright.
[115:50.63]One of these guys is gonna stand up.
[116:02.77]No, come on.
[116:03.59]I can't.
[116:04.03]I don't want to say it.
[116:05.80]I don't want to say it.
[116:06.42]I don't want to say... I found Yellow, the dead body, among us.
[116:11.54]Like, I found him.
[116:12.24]Who was it?
[116:13.00]Right?
[116:13.30]Like, come on.
[116:13.92]Like, I'm sorry.
[116:15.74]Why?
[116:16.54]I'm sorry.
[116:18.60]I'm sorry.
[116:20.29]It doesn't even make any sense.
[116:21.03]Can I use this?
[116:26.29]I like... Oh, it's a hat!
[116:27.55]It's weird.
[116:36.90]Heard the Half-Life door sound.
[116:38.81]Ugh.
[116:41.99]So anything happen when you cut out?
[116:49.27]You're not gonna believe this, but I ran into a border guard.
[116:52.52]What?
[116:53.76]What is he doing now?
[116:54.64]I stood in the heart.
[116:55.60]In the heart.
[116:56.02]I think he escaped from the combine.
[116:58.78]What did he say?
[117:00.28]These are the spiky ones.
[117:01.42]He said to bring some border guard stuff.
[117:32.18]I give up.
[117:38.41]Get that off.
[117:40.57]I just don't care.
[117:41.21]I don't care if I miss.
[117:43.39]I don't care if I miss, right?
[117:44.63]Like, I don't care if I miss.
[117:45.93]Stop caring and you'll get it, right?
[117:47.15]No, I don't care.
[117:47.75]I don't care if I miss.
[117:48.57]I don't give a shit if I miss.
[117:49.31]I'm gonna go.
[117:53.67]I'm gonna keep moving.
[117:54.96]I obviously can't shoot that guy.
[117:56.72]I don't even care if I miss.
[117:57.56]I don't care.
[117:58.56]I don't care if I miss.
[118:22.75]Oh, electricity.
[118:26.13]Oh, electricity.
[118:32.43]What's that?
[118:38.57]Oh, it was just his shoes.
[118:39.93]Never mind.
[118:47.01]What's in here?
[118:59.16]Oh, wait a minute.
[119:01.46]Something in the barrel.
[119:18.80]What is that?
[119:22.68]Put the mask on.
[119:23.94]Wear the mask.
[119:24.74]Wear the mask.
[119:40.11]Oh, that Vortigaunt I met?
[119:42.35]He did give me a headcrab to eat.
[119:44.17]Oh, great!
[119:45.00]What did it taste like?
[119:45.98]Tell me how you... Russell, Russell!
[119:48.00]I didn't eat it.
[119:49.54]Right.
[119:50.32]Of course you didn't.
[119:51.14]Now that's... I can check down there, but what is this guy holding?
[120:02.57]Press him.
[120:05.31]Oh, that zombie has a shotgun.
[120:08.13]What?
[120:12.23]There's a shotgun in the game?
[120:13.29]Alright.
[120:17.57]That's shit.
[120:18.19]That's the only brick I had.
[120:19.77]What do I do now?
[120:20.23]I don't drop him?
[120:44.72]And I aim.
[120:45.38]Use two hands.
[120:54.67]I'm shooting it!
[120:57.97]Omega low, you idiot.
[121:07.26]I just, like, force walk to the ground.

[121:29.35]Oh, alright.
[121:31.99]There we go.
[121:33.83]Do you hear that?
[121:36.59]Yeah.
[121:38.14]Let's get this shotgun and get out of here.
[121:42.32]What's down there?
[121:42.94]I don't even know if you can hear that.
[121:50.40]What are these?
[121:52.22]What are these?
[121:52.72]I don't know.
[121:54.78]The bullets!

[122:14.99]Give me the shotgun, dude!
[122:20.97]Let it go!
[122:30.73]No, stop!
[122:31.63]Where's the thing?
[122:39.88]Alright, stop it right there.
[122:44.84]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[122:52.00]How do I open a shotgun to load shells? What?
[122:59.00]Oh shit.
[123:05.37]Okay, I got the shotgun.
[123:08.37]Oh there's- I just throw.
[123:23.37]Get out of here.
[123:20.84]Hey, whoa.
[123:25.70]We did it.
[123:27.82]I love this gun.
[123:32.65]Last shell.
[123:35.03]I'm out.
[123:35.91]Last shell?
[123:36.97]Fuck you.
[123:37.59]Any more?
[124:02.77]I'm basically gonna stand up.
[124:03.66]I haven't gotten any resin either.
[124:04.76]I'm so bad.
[124:05.28]I'm such a bad player.
[124:32.61]Stiff gamer.
[124:33.61]Yeah, kind of.
[124:49.06]What's over here?
[124:49.94]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[124:54.60]There's something under this.
[124:59.04]I almost just died.
[125:01.56]This room.
[125:07.05]bottle or something.
[125:14.17]Ow!
[125:18.78]Oh!
[125:22.34]Hell yeah.
[125:25.00]The headcrab.
[125:25.56]Did I do that?
[125:27.64]Wait.
[125:28.02]Who wants a drink?
[125:36.43]What did that do?
[125:37.14]What did that do for me?
[126:12.20]Yeah, that's it.
[126:12.86]That's all I can do.
[126:16.86]Testaments.
[126:26.88]Progress.
[126:38.91]OK, let me ask you a question.
[126:41.18]If you could eat this, if this was completely edible, but it stunk like rotten trash, but it was like 25 grams of protein and like all your vitamins, like vitamin C, vitamin B, vitamin A, all of them.
[126:53.25]This was like six years worth of food.
[126:57.37]Eat this, or over here on that pallet over here is a stack of a year's worth of Chef Boyardee mini raviolis.
[127:07.74]And this is like stacked up to this height.
[127:09.69]This is at least five years.
[127:10.97]This is one year.
[127:11.71]I would take that one.
[127:18.16]I would take the sure thing.
[127:39.70]I'm in here.
[127:41.29]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[127:43.37]What?
[127:49.01]What?
[127:49.85]How could there be nothing in a chest?
[127:51.13]That's bullshit.
[128:03.75]Whee!
[128:21.19]Uh, I have a gas mask, right?
[128:23.61]I did.
[128:23.95]Oh, shit, okay.
[128:34.05]Oh, shit, oh, shit, oh, shit.
[128:36.21]Okay, we're not gonna fuck around.
[128:43.38]Whoa!
[128:43.80]Wipeout!
[129:08.06]Holy shit, okay.
[129:15.04]Overkill, was it?
[129:18.42]Wait, I need to.
[129:22.83]I'm just gonna... Who holds a shotgun like this?
[129:38.14]Ammo bad, dude.
[129:39.08]It's not looking good.
[129:42.86]Oh.
[129:45.36]Take a resin.
[130:14.59]Out.
[130:42.81]I almost have full health.
[130:49.35]These things again.
[130:56.36]Got it.
[131:05.66]Oh, it's an upgrade station.
[131:12.35]No.
[131:13.83]Eh, I don't have enough resin for any of this stuff.
[131:16.44]Oh.
[131:16.94]Ah, well, you know what they say about resin, Alex?
[131:19.90]No, what do they say about resin, Russ?
[131:23.02]Uh, look.
[131:23.44]What the fuck are you talking about?
[131:25.96]More resin.
[131:27.38]Okay.
[131:28.56]Listen.
[131:29.54]Yeah, that's the one.
[131:30.44]Look for more resin.
[131:31.48]Shit.
[131:32.06]Come on.
[131:36.47]There's gotta be some resin.
[131:37.89]Don't I have one of those?
[131:55.75]Resin hiding under one of these, I guarantee it.
[131:57.45]Use one of these.
[132:05.25]Oh yeah!
[132:08.16]Resin, but I'll take the ammo, I need it.
[132:12.92]Okay, do I do the side or do I just hold it?
[132:21.88]Yes, I would eat a headcrab if I had to, if I was like life or death.
[132:26.80]I'm not going to go like, ew, gross, ew, no, I don't want it.
[132:30.10]If I'm going to die, if I'm starving to death, I'm going to eat a head crab.
[132:34.78]Why wouldn't you?
[132:35.34]Why are you so against doing that?
[132:45.13]I could heal, but I don't really need to.
[132:58.33]I saved the resin.
[132:58.93]I'm not going to use it.
[133:08.73]No point.
[133:15.89]Okay, where am I?
[133:17.55]I'm somewhere in the house.
[133:19.99]I don't know where I am.
[133:24.71]Where am I?
[133:29.19]At the shelf, okay.
[133:32.11]That means I should be facing the right way now.
[133:33.85]That's good.
[133:41.17]Crack my fingers.
[133:41.77]God dammit, they take three hits each.
[134:04.02]Did I not catch that?
[134:04.82]How?
[134:05.92]I've been catching it all day.
[134:10.84]Wait a minute, get closer.
[134:15.81]I need 25, right?
[134:16.39]Right, that's good.
[134:35.90]Where do I go?
[134:36.42]Three shells left.
[134:45.55]Out of shells.
[134:52.65]Ban the counters.
[134:55.01]Alright, start banning them.
[134:57.73]Start banning the counters.
[134:59.93]They need to get like a five minute timeout.
[135:03.76]Start banning those counters!
[135:12.96]What did I miss?
[135:15.41]Oh, okay.
[135:20.37]Monster?
[135:44.51]Here we go.
[135:44.99]What about down there?
[135:51.53]Go to catch.
[136:06.40]No.
[136:07.62]No.
[136:16.61]Oh shit, I... Wake up!
[136:23.98]He just threw a bottle at me!
[136:29.23]That guy just whipped a fucking glass bottle in my face!
[136:50.08]I do appreciate this mechanic.
[136:52.52]Like, well, it's actually really, really fun just to do it.
[136:57.90]Works out pretty well.
[137:02.93]Electricity field?
[137:09.81]You're alive.
[137:10.89]Oh, he's alive.
[137:11.59]That kind of was scary for a second.
[137:23.23]Can I go through that?
[137:23.92]Doesn't look like it hurts.
[137:27.02]Where's this go?
[137:52.38]Alright, now this has to go over here.
[137:54.56]Oh, this one's off.
[137:57.30]And then... Look at the fucking floor.
[138:12.92]Get, uh...
[138:27.32]Door is locked.
[138:28.14]It's a locked door.
[138:29.02]Are you serious?
[138:32.58]Door is- it's a locked fucking door.
[138:41.88]Oh, get this one down.
[138:43.78]Oh, we get the key.
[138:44.54]Okay, both hands.
[139:00.11]I knew there was gonna be a guy.
[139:00.99]Hey!
[139:04.29]You're supposed to be dead!
[139:13.25]Okay, laugh.
[139:19.06]Show penis.
[139:21.62]That's the fir- That's- That's literally the first thing I see.
[139:24.10]Show penis.
[139:26.68]Show- Show your penis.
[139:31.67]Alright, I think that's probably the key.
[139:36.23]It collapsed on so let me get the shotgun out.
[139:55.87]I'm gonna, yeah, I'm gonna get collapsed on, I guarantee it.
[139:58.03]I'm good.
[139:58.31]Oh.
[139:58.39]Give me that back.
[139:59.45]Okay, I'm ready.
[140:23.93]I'm ready for whatever the fuck is about to happen.
[140:26.69]I'm gonna pick up the key and there's gonna be ten people.
[140:31.53]Look at how many shotgun shells.
[140:33.95]Yeah, they're saying this is like a boss fight.
[140:38.19]That's a lot of ammo.
[140:39.51]Okay, here we go.
[140:52.80]Flash flashlight to gravity glove.
[140:56.08]Oh.
[141:06.97]Oh, thank god.

[142:22.12]About anything.
[142:23.68]Literally anything.
[142:25.80]Oh, this hand.
[142:26.66]Your irrational fear of the dark is actually quite appropriate.
[142:29.77]You know, I can give you easily a hundred reasons to be terrified.

[148:29.31]Alex, have you ever heard of a club cell?
[148:32.76]Nope, not once.
[148:35.18]I actually would rather you talk about something else completely.
[148:39.14]A slice of food.
[148:39.98]We've been eating fucking soup out of a can for the last five years.
[148:42.26]I don't want to hear about this.
[148:45.09]Tell me about something else.
[148:52.04]It's making me want to turn the stream up.
[148:53.74]You guys had all that.
[148:54.48]I want one of those now.
[148:55.82]That's insane.
[148:56.90]It is, and I'm not done.
[148:59.14]Then you add a second sandwich on top of the first one.
[149:01.90]You put ham in it, also from a pig, and turkey from an animal we used to call... Back up!
[149:06.52]Back the fuck up!
[149:07.46]And more tomato or lettuce.
[149:09.44]I can't back up!
[149:11.23]It was six inches tall and weighed a pound and had a dozen ingredients from five different continents.

[153:06.44]Fucking nerve-wracking, man.
[153:07.68]This is scary shit.
[153:09.16]I thought this was an ammo.
[153:16.23]Really?
[153:26.99]Uh-huh.
[153:31.59]The one thing I don't, why?
[153:37.46]I have to scratch the very part of my back that I cannot reach to put that in my backpack.
[153:51.08]What does it even do?
[153:56.36]I only have one of these?
[154:01.03]Oh shit.

[159:47.88]When you guys were off stealing the reactor, I saw the Combine moving supplies in here.
[159:51.88]So, I guess they're interested in this place again.
[159:55.31]Right, well keep an eye out.

[190:02.61]There's one.
[190:03.05]There's two.
[190:04.07]Okay.
[190:04.61]Three.
[190:05.89]Four.
[190:06.21]Five.
[190:07.71]Six.
[190:08.15]Did I get him?
[190:20.42]What the fuck was that sound?
[190:33.31]Oh shit, he has the thing.
[190:34.49]Wait, I didn't get the resin.
[190:36.93]Oh no.
[190:37.67]Wait a minute, I can get it.
[190:53.12]Pat, does Jerma not know about round in the chamber?
[190:55.69]What?
[190:58.04]I'm talking to him.
[191:21.25]This is so dangerous.
[191:22.34]I hate this place.
[191:26.26]Too dangerous, man.
[191:27.04]It's too dangerous.
[191:27.64]I don't like it here.
[191:44.71]Uhhh.
[191:52.18]Am I going the right way?
[191:53.04]I think so.
[191:53.82]Go that way first.
[191:58.06]Let's kill this guy.
[192:00.44]Don't hit him.
[192:01.58]Closer.
[192:09.89]Okay, I think I found the exit.
[192:15.37]Nothing over here?
[192:21.85]I don't even care, get me out.
[192:25.67]Wait, that's gonna blow the whole place, that's gonna blow the whole place, isn't it?
[192:27.88]Does that blow the whole place?
[192:31.98]Does it blow the whole place?
[192:35.82]I don't know where to go.
[192:37.46]Give me, give me, give me.
[192:38.30]Alex?
[192:38.52]Alex?
[192:59.72]Why did you go back?
[193:02.78]The wheel!
[193:03.38]I guess the wheel is down there.
[193:06.27]I didn't get the wheel.
[193:09.49]Bro.
[193:12.43]I didn't get the wheel.
[193:14.11]Bro.
[193:23.32]Alright, this is not bad.
[193:24.46]Right here.
[193:36.03]I need full shots for this.
[193:42.87]By the way, how does it fucking work?
[193:48.63]Go, go, go, go, go.
[193:50.87]Give me it.
[193:51.63]Give me this.
[193:53.45]Hey!
[193:54.57]Hey!
[193:55.11]Hey!
[193:56.15]Hey!
[193:56.59]Uh, what?
[193:58.63]Hey!
[193:58.93]Am I safe in here?
[194:01.13]Close the door.
[194:04.48]What?
[194:07.10]Alex!
[194:10.71]Oh, I know what to do.
[194:11.29]I could just shoot.
[194:11.81]Okay, I know.
[194:12.29]I gotta kill the thing.
[194:13.97]I gotta kill the thing before it sucks up.
[194:15.51]Okay, I thought it was a timer.
[194:26.20]I didn't know!
[194:26.78]I didn't... I didn't know that I had to shoot the thing before it got the thing up there.
[194:33.71]Bro!
[194:37.28]What do you guys want me to fucking say?
[194:41.66]Oh yeah, this guy.
[194:42.48]Oh, we got a fucking comedian, huh?
[194:48.30]I'm gonna hit something if I don't fucking relax.
[194:54.99]Hit the round in the gun when loading the new gun.
[194:56.99]I don't know anything about guns.
[195:11.53]I have to kill this guy first.
[195:12.92]Kill him!
[195:17.94]Hey, hey, hey, hey!
[195:23.32]Don't move!
[195:26.69]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa-ee!
[195:46.97]Oh, you keep one in the chamber.
[195:55.70]Oh, that's what you guys mean.
[195:59.18]Oh, I get it.
[196:00.80]I get it.
[196:01.32]I understand.
[196:08.27]That's what I have?
[196:11.77]OK.
[196:21.61]Get that shortcut, though.
[196:22.57]What do you say, fellas?
[196:25.86]Actually, I might as well just use it, because there's one right there.
[196:34.52]Full health.
[196:36.66]Cranes also jump.
[196:51.67]Ro?
[196:55.67]That's the shelf.
[196:56.43]That's the shelf.
[196:57.17]I knew it.
[196:58.61]I knew it.
[197:00.23]Imagine if I smashed it.
[197:02.03]My fucking face.
[197:09.57]It's glass.
[197:19.33]Half-Life Alyx, it's the funniest movie of the year.
[197:27.68]Critics are saying it's the best VR game of 2020.
[197:30.88]Half-Life Alyx, rated PG.
[197:33.90]DC, I'm not...
[197:50.17]But you need to take up to like an hour to figure this out.
[197:52.27]What was that, 20 minutes?
[197:53.11]Is that 20 minutes?
[198:11.19]One.
[198:13.29]Ooh, next chapter.
[198:14.07]Sick.
[198:21.70]It's been four hours?
[198:23.16]How long has it actually been?
[198:25.38]What time is it?
[198:32.77]Wait, what?
[198:33.67]I mean, isn't this three and a half hours?
[198:36.31]Are you kidding me?
[198:45.01]I'm surprised it didn't end here for that long.
[198:48.43]I mean, I'm still, I'm still good, I'm alright.
[198:50.71]I'm good to go for, like, probably another hour.
[198:51.87]Let's see.
[198:55.41]Oh, good.
[199:04.68]Look, I'll be honest, this is like a real video game.
[199:08.34]I'm, like, playing through the actual video game, so... I mean, I'm not... I think it's a good... So far...
[199:18.58]Holy shit.
[199:19.38]Air.
[199:32.20]Combine.
[199:33.26]Rest.
[199:33.90]These guys have automatic weapons.
[199:35.68]They're alien commandos.
[199:36.90]Of course they have automatic weapons.
[199:39.14]We'd have them too, but combine weapons are gene-coded, so out of luck.
[199:42.02]Oh, I'm actually going to land on his head.
[199:43.42]You'll find one that's unbonded.
[199:45.08]Or you're open to some minor genetic modification.
[199:48.25]I'm actually going to land on his head.
[199:49.77]I'm good, Raz.
[199:50.59]I'm just going to avoid these genes that I've got.
[199:54.61]That train's going to turn on and come right at me.
[199:56.29]Ready?
[199:56.89]One, two, three.
[200:02.67]I'm going to turn right.
[200:07.09]Waitin' for it.
[200:16.18]Fuck, okay.
[200:17.44]Hi, guys.
[200:24.45]That facing the right way?
[200:42.16]Good.
[200:42.48]Okay.
[200:43.76]So far, so good.
[200:44.60]I'm almost making it to the... I can make this whole jump, can't I?
[200:48.46]Oh, hell yeah.
[200:49.02]Let's do a skateboard video.
[200:57.37]Upgrades.
[200:58.47]What do I upgrade?
[201:06.81]What do I do?
[201:12.92]She knows.
[201:24.13]Laser sight on the pistol?
[201:25.29]I kinda want the shotgun up here.
[201:29.19]How much resin do I have?
[201:30.57]I have 28?! !
[201:35.69]Double shot?
[201:36.36]What is double shot, dude?
[201:38.12]It adds the option to fire a second shot immediately after the first.
[201:42.56]Oops.
[201:46.32]Cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel, cancel.
[201:48.79]How come he never has ammo?
[201:53.11]Ass.
[201:53.21]What do we got here?
[202:02.00]First fire.
[202:04.60]Has a toggle between 3-shot burst- I hate burst fire, it's terrible.
[202:09.00]Laser sight is 35.
[202:10.94]Bullet reservoir.
[202:11.66]Has a reservoir that holds 10 additional bullets!
[202:16.87]David, should I just save for the laser sight?
[202:18.85]Just go all the way to the bottom, go all up?
[202:20.41]Sounds like a good idea.
[202:25.51]I fucking don't need this.
[202:46.00]Why am I just dropping bullets?
[202:49.86]What the fuck, dude?
[202:51.08]Oh, almost there.
[202:59.43]I feel like some of them have actually hit the ground.
[203:08.53]I didn't even know.
[203:12.27]Oh, fuck.
[203:19.28]What was that?
[203:21.12]Me.
[203:22.56]I think he saw me.
[203:23.16]Come on.
[203:23.44]Here you go.
[203:50.58]Oh shit!
[203:51.36]Don't look at your phone when you're in the middle of a war zone!
[203:53.72]I shot him in the head like three times!
[204:26.73]Is he with a machine gun?
[204:29.41]They have machine guns, don't they?
[204:31.26]Where's his machine gun?
[204:32.60]Where's your machine gun?
[204:35.88]I can't get his machine gun or something?
[204:37.10]What?
[204:37.82]Why?
[204:40.78]What am I touching?
[204:41.38]Please.
[204:51.61]We'll be one in the chamber in a minute.
[205:02.79]What a hammer, nice.
[205:03.45]I feel like every time I do that, you guys can see my money.
[205:12.39]I guarantee that's happened at least once.
[205:15.02]Somebody is going to zoom in, zoom in, zoom in, zoom in, zoom in, sharpen, sharpen, zoom in, sharpen, zoom in, sharpen, and he's gonna get like a picture of my ass crack.
[205:24.10]Like blown up and like upscaled to 4K.
[205:30.87]Okay, might as well just take it.
[205:32.53]Oh, this one.
[206:02.45]Alright, they're just, they're just blowing out firecrackers, it's okay.
[206:16.94]Oh, fuck.
[206:18.92]Ah!
[206:24.10]Alright, lock and load, let's go.
[206:25.14]This is, this is how we separate the, uh, the boys, the men from the boys.
[206:30.10]And we gotta go and enter ZUNA!
[206:59.47]Hey, it's me!
[207:00.63]It's me!
[207:01.23]I think you're both dickheads!
[207:03.33]You'll never shoot me, ever!
[207:05.19]You'll never get me, Falcon Felfort!
[207:33.49]Thanks a lot, man.
[207:34.37]You saved my ass.
[207:44.86]Sorry, what?
[207:46.64]Why would you not take cover before reloading?
[207:52.64]Um, I got him alive, aren't I?
[208:00.63]Oh.
[208:03.93]There goes more.
[208:12.10]Oh, we're clear.
[208:16.99]Present.
[208:29.46]Get the fucking door open already, for the love of God, move out of my fucking way.
[208:32.87]Ah, I'm making sure there's enough windows!
[208:48.50]Ah!
[208:55.40]Oh my God!
[209:12.75]Give me it.
[209:14.63]Dude, not a valve.
[209:15.85]Now is not the time for this bullshit.
[209:19.38]This is expended.
[209:33.89]Oh my god.
[209:34.75]I think that's the last of them.
[209:39.82]Am I like 10?
[209:40.26]Did I grow like 15 feet?
[209:44.00]What?
[209:44.16]Wait, what?
[209:44.66]Why do I feel huge now?
[209:49.76]It's weird?
[209:50.52]I'm 15 feet tall.
[210:02.81]It was fun, boys.
[210:05.23]Oh, Jesus.
[210:08.25]What happened?
[210:08.87]Why am I fucking huge?
[210:10.37]I'm almost at the top of the train.
[210:13.13]Doesn't this make me a bigger target?
[210:21.80]I feel like I can talk underneath this shit.
[210:26.36]I'm a giant.
[210:34.53]Yeah, I need to use... Holy shit, I need to use this one.
[210:37.31]I gotta crouch down and... What did I do?
[210:45.94]Teleport?
[211:11.43]I don't know what happened.
[211:12.09]They shot me full of something weird.
[211:13.59]Why can't I... What's the height in the game?
[211:22.68]Underwear.
[211:27.52]I'm going to leave it for now because it's kind of funny.
[211:48.03]Oh, electrical grid.
[211:49.11]Electrical grid.
[211:49.97]Electrical grid.
[211:50.73]There's a control station override nearby.
[212:07.33]Hello.
[212:08.80]Oh no, we gotta do this.
[213:31.72]You should have plenty of time to get the override back online.
[213:36.04]Alright, let's go.
[213:42.84]Oh, what the hell?
[213:43.50]Let me alone.
[213:48.03]Alright, I'll be able to stop the train right here.
[213:50.69]You sure you can do that?
[213:52.03]Absolutely.
[213:52.73]You just need to access the terminal.
[213:54.39]Nice.
[213:55.11]Then you'll need to be ready for a fight.
[213:56.37]Oh, maybe I can see that.
[213:58.09]All the way over here.
[214:05.63]Why am I wearing those stilts that Uncle Sam wears?
[214:09.87]Okay, I really do use this way too much.
[214:19.49]Use your left shoulder.
[214:21.28]Right, that's the terminal there.
[214:25.32]I'm on it.
[214:26.36]Do hurry, though.
[214:28.70]What?
[214:30.40]What happened?
[214:40.44]Oh, I'm back down to here.
[214:41.42]That's so powerful.
[215:30.80]There must be a battery around here somewhere.
[215:59.69]There's always a resident behind here.
[216:21.77]I feel like boogers all over me.
[216:26.31]This booger's on me.
[216:29.16]This book is on me somewhere.
[216:32.60]I get it?
[216:32.88]I don't know.
[216:44.76]Coming out.
[216:46.08]Coming out, I'm coming out.
[216:50.75]Holy shit.
[216:52.29]Why is my webcam so laggy?
[216:57.95]Why is the webcam so fucking laggy?
[217:05.17]This is bullshit.
[217:11.55]See?
[217:12.05]What was that?
[217:12.49]That was bullshit.
[217:13.09]I just took off this low light compensation.
[217:15.28]Get the fuck out of here.
[217:16.16]We're at 60 FPS now.
[217:18.96]What was that?
[217:24.46]How's the hair?
[217:25.10]Yeah, it's time for a break.
[217:26.70]It's time for a pee in water.
[217:30.83]Take a look.
[217:31.71]Yeah, it's a water and pee break time.
[217:39.21]Let me put the BRB on.
[217:43.35]How do we look?
[217:45.45]Uh, really squished.
[217:50.68]Not good.
[217:52.10]Not good!
[217:56.35]I'll be right back.
[217:57.70]Water.
[218:00.59]And pee.
[220:22.78]Okay.
[220:24.84]Hold on, let me mute for a sec.
[220:32.66]Moving the mic.
[220:33.36]Let me wipe this down one more time.
[220:36.85]Yeah, I probably... Maybe like another half hour or so.
[220:41.27]I'm still feeling okay.
[220:43.33]I woke up pretty tight this morning, but... I know I'm probably gonna be... Very, very, very tight tomorrow.
[220:52.83]But it's alright.
[220:53.29]After today, I'm coming back this weekend anyways.
[220:57.34]However far I get tonight, I'll be back on Saturday and Sunday.
[221:01.52]To finish Half-Life Alyx.
[221:11.17]And for whatever else is on tap.
[221:15.78]The game's around 15 hours long.
[221:17.30]Holy shit.
[221:17.98]Well, if we do it for the next couple of streams, that's, you know, 4, 8, 5, 8, 12.
[221:27.41]How's your gamer finger?
[221:28.23]It's okay.
[221:28.49]It's healing.
[221:35.62]Rain is a good stopping point, like right here.
[221:42.66]Game is long?
[221:43.34]Well, that's pretty good.
[221:45.62]Fix it up.
[221:46.02]Alright, well, how about this?
[221:49.00]After today, I plan on being back on Saturday, Sunday.
[221:50.99]So how about this?
[221:52.35]On Saturday, we'll do some, like, goofy shit.
[221:55.31]And then Sunday, we'll go back into Half-Life Alyx.
[221:58.23]How's that sound?
[222:07.28]Saturday of what month?
[222:11.09]Alright, I'll do Chubby Bunny on Saturday, alright?
[222:14.75]I'm gonna do VR, but I'll, before the VR starts, I'll do Chubby Bunny for five minutes.
[222:19.90]Okay?
[222:20.48]That's Saturday.
[222:21.00]That's how I'm gonna open the stream.
[222:24.16]I'm gonna get embarrassed in just chatting.
[222:25.92]Alright, I'm ready to hop back in for like, maybe like another 34 minutes.
[222:32.49]It's actually really fun though, I'm having a lot of fun.
[222:40.45]Back over here.
[222:40.97]Hi.
[222:44.15]I have returned.
[222:50.66]You are not having any fun.
[222:53.24]That would be... That would be bad, wouldn't it?
[223:09.38]Why does it look hazy in here?
[223:11.84]Eh, I'll clean it later.
[223:14.60]Alright, let's just continue.
[223:15.70]Our trip through Half- Alyx.
[223:21.62]Don't leave that on the ground, I need that.
[223:23.28]Alright, can you guys scream at me when it's been about 30 or 40 minutes?
[223:38.55]I'll lose track in here.
[223:39.43]Alright, here we go.
[223:55.33]Power.
[224:00.04]Okay.
[224:06.20]Puzzle.
[224:18.46]Good that lined up Really not one in here I take this out
[224:48.62]Maybe it's missing a piece.
[224:50.98]You think I'm stupid?
[224:52.06]Of course, I don't know, might be missing something.
[225:10.35]Alright, let's find the wheel.
[225:14.03]Okay.
[225:22.35]He wasn't even close, he wasn't even close.
[225:31.93]Oh shit.
[225:38.69]Hey!
[225:42.80]Oh great.
[225:45.62]Fuck.
[225:48.58]Hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide, hide.
[225:53.34]Where'd he go?
[225:55.14]Where'd he go?
[225:56.14]Where'd he go?
[225:56.48]He was right here.
[225:56.94]Where'd he go?
[225:57.26]Oh.
[225:57.32]I think he fell down there.
[226:00.56]Alright.
[226:01.90]That's a win.
[226:02.30]Alright.
[226:14.89]Got it.
[226:16.39]Sick.
[226:16.59]Let's go.
[226:26.42]Okay, no worries.
[226:30.15]But the train is coming.
[226:31.69]Just get me in.
[226:32.21]It'll only take a second.
[226:33.43]You're doing great.
[226:34.47]Yep, you're great.
[226:35.61]No worries.
[226:36.25]No worries.
[226:37.35]No worries.
[226:40.68]Okay, now just re-engage the system.
[226:46.76]H. What?
[226:48.40]Alright, stop the train!
[226:50.06]Stop the train!
[226:50.74]Okay, uh...
[227:17.35]It won't stay.
[227:18.82]Hold it down.
[227:48.22]That's pretty fun.
[227:50.98]Alright.
[228:17.42]Look for the prisoner transport car.
[228:19.08]It should be towards the front of the train.
[228:20.54]Okay.
[228:20.80]I'll find a way into the wreckage.
[228:35.80]He came here.
[228:42.91]Dude, what are they, man?
[228:44.33]I don't know.
[228:45.29]What are those?
[228:46.35]Okay, we're good.
[229:13.64]I gotta go this way, right?
[229:19.62]Yeah, this way.
[229:24.02]Resin?
[229:33.83]I'm resin.
[229:36.91]That's your dad's prisoner port.
[229:39.31]Oh my god.
[229:40.25]Where's dad?
[229:41.63]Dad?
[229:42.97]Reach out and pull you up?
[229:48.36]I'm not tall enough for this!
[229:51.54]I can't do it!
[230:11.50]It's this ghost!
[230:20.13]Oh no, stop.
[230:21.89]He saved them!
[230:22.51]My friends!
[230:23.79]I have come to help, as I said I would.
[230:27.63]Thank you.
[230:29.31]Thank you.
[230:29.93]Just stay there.
[230:32.42]I'm gonna figure out how to get over to you.
[230:34.02]No!
[230:35.16]Alex, listen!
[230:36.28]The thing was, when I found it, some sort of super weapon.
[230:39.66]A super weapon?
[230:40.84]It's something big.
[230:42.20]They got it here in the QZ and some... Alex!
[230:50.59]I was trying to get closer to here.
[230:54.43]You just... Oops.
[230:57.77]Of all the things to kill you in Half-Life, really?
[231:05.71]Okay, in my defense, listen to me, in my defense, I couldn't walk forward when he was reaching his hand out.
[231:12.74]There was a wall there.
[231:13.88]They took the invisible wall down while that conversation happened.
[231:17.98]Oh, my God.
[231:19.62]Where's Dad?
[231:20.34]Dad?
[231:20.82]Watch, ready?
[231:21.68]Dad!
[231:22.04]Can you see?
[231:23.56]Look.
[231:24.71]I'm holding up.
[231:25.35]Can you see?
[231:25.93]I'm going to reach out and pull you up.
[231:26.83]It's going to be okay.
[231:28.07]I'm holding up right now.
[231:29.19]You ready?
[231:29.55]Yeah.
[231:30.51]I'm good.
[231:31.25]Give me your hand.
[231:33.31]Okay.
[231:35.98]Come on, you can do it.
[231:36.83]Wait, what if I actually get there?
[231:46.05]Here I am.
[231:47.11]It's me, the Flying Dutchman.
[231:49.55]SpongeBob.
[231:53.94]Alex Vance, I have come to help, as I said I would.
[231:59.48]Thank you.
[232:00.08]Thank you.
[232:03.03]Just stay there.
[232:04.25]I'm going to figure out how to get over to you.
[232:05.87]No.
[232:06.93]Alex, listen.
[232:08.11]The thing Russell and I found is some sort of super weapon.
[232:11.51]A super weapon?
[232:12.17]Super weapon.
[232:12.83]Something big.
[232:13.79]Something huge.
[232:14.21]It's in here in the QZ in some kind of vault.
[232:16.29]But they're about to move it.
[232:17.71]Where?
[232:17.93]I don't know, but it's going to be soon.
[232:19.85]Then we've got to steal it before they do.
[232:21.77]Yes.
[232:22.70]And look, look.
[232:24.00]I managed to pocket this Combine datapod.
[232:26.51]If I can decrypt it, we can figure out how to use that weapon against them.
[232:29.87]So what's the plan?
[232:30.89]You head to the vault.
[232:32.45]I'll take this thing back to Russell's and get to work.
[232:34.56]Wait, where is the vault?
[232:36.62]Dad, where's the vault?
[232:38.38]Look to the northern star.
[232:41.90]I guess.
[232:42.50]Look to the start.
[232:43.60]Got it.
[232:44.22]Dad?
[232:44.72]It's right in the middle of the QC and it's big.
[232:47.37]Get him up around and see what you can find.
[232:49.83]I will accompany the Eli back and ensure his safety.
[232:56.03]Great.
[232:56.77]Thank you.
[232:57.61]Dad, I'm going to go find this box.
[233:02.34]No.
[233:02.56]Stay safe, baby.
[233:03.22]I love you.
[233:05.08]I love you, too.
[233:05.84]I love you, too.
[233:11.84]The Vortigaunts are good guys, right?
[233:14.90]They don't like the G-Man.
[233:19.80]Don't do it.
[233:21.34]You know it's available, but don't do it.
[233:26.85]Oh, they're the bad guys.
[233:29.89]And G-Man's the good guy.
[233:31.57]Nobody knows.
[233:32.15]Oh, when?
[233:32.39]When he gets here?
[233:45.34]Trust G-Man.
[233:49.50]I mean, they never, like, really made it clear.
[233:52.40]It was open to interpretation of what was even going on.
[233:58.44]I just, you know, I'm one of those people.
[234:00.66]I think G-Man is Gordon Freeman without the goatee on.
[234:03.75]And it's like him, like, a thousand years in the future or something, going back and like, well, I'm in that camp.
[234:13.58]True, true, true.
[234:14.38]Yeah, I know.
[234:15.04]Come on.
[234:15.26]Alright, we're gonna go green, green.
[234:18.80]I see where they are.
[234:19.36]Got it already.
[234:28.24]We got it already.
[234:28.80]Got it already.
[234:50.01]There was like a Plants vs. Zombies thing I was going for with like, oh, look at this, it's like with the things in the heads.
[235:07.02]Pockets and whatever.
[235:22.83]Scared the shit out of me.
[235:23.63]I was like, whose hand is that?
[235:27.05]Can't break it?
[235:30.95]Whatever.
[235:41.37]That didn't open?
[235:42.65]All top of this?
[235:43.15]Capture complete.
[235:52.90]Cone on head.
[235:53.74]Cone on head.
[235:55.98]No.
[235:58.50]Yes, you can have the same shoulder as your hand for ammo and resin.
[236:01.54]No, I missed it.
[236:05.28]What do you think, Jerma?
[236:06.26]Class or swag?
[236:09.03]Why can't it be both?
[236:10.03]It would be classy with some swag.
[236:13.91]What do you mean?
[236:15.59]Hey.
[236:17.11]Take notes.
[236:18.45]You're looking at it.
[236:23.65]Oops.
[236:24.03]I hit the thing.
[236:26.13]I'm classy, but no, I'm not.
[236:28.43]I have no idea what I'm doing, right?
[236:29.55]You did get that back.
[236:31.81]Yeah.
[236:33.85]What?
[236:35.12]That's probably going to draw some attention.
[236:37.62]Not probably, actually.
[236:38.86]It's definitely drawing attention.
[236:41.22]Mutants!
[236:41.76]Look, they're looking for you now, okay?
[236:43.28]So just be careful.
[236:46.74]It did.
[236:47.34]It did.
[236:47.58]You know, if we can get this weapon, we could change things forever.
[236:50.78]I haven't shoot it.
[236:51.34]It did.
[236:54.54]Look, I know we've only been working together for a few hours now, but I want you to know I'm proud of you.
[237:00.36]You're under a lot of pressure.
[237:03.38]PvP fucking master.
[237:04.36]So much pressure, in fact, that I hesitate to even bring it up.
[237:08.00]But I did notice that when you reached out for your father's hand, had he actually grabbed it, his grip would have crushed all the delicate senses in the rustle.
[237:17.83]Okay.
[237:18.27]Totally understandable, and would have been worth it, by the way, in this case.
[237:23.07]Right.
[237:23.63]Having said that, I have a hard time imagining another situation where that would have been the case.
[237:28.88]I'm streaming, I forgot, sorry.
[237:29.98]And much like your father, the Russells are priceless.
[237:33.04]Okay, so just, you know, moving forward.
[237:35.94]Russ, I promise your gloves are safe with me.
[237:46.77]That's it.
[237:49.43]That's it?
[238:00.20]I definitely have enough to do the laser side, by the way.
[238:08.54]Right?
[238:08.74]I definitely do.
[238:09.24]$30.90.
[238:09.26]I need two more.
[238:13.42]Two more and I can do it.
[238:20.16]Your balls are hanging out.
[238:21.58]Well... See you on, like, Fiverr.
[238:29.34]Bye.
[238:40.09]Can't open these?
[238:47.07]Oh, shit!
[238:47.79]Whoa!
[238:48.94]Oh, Butterfingers, come on.
[238:50.38]Oh, I didn't even know that's what I was doing.
[238:53.32]How do I get in there?
[238:54.84]Fuck, those are the two that I need.
[239:01.11]How do I get down there?
[239:20.48]Resident on the ground.
[239:21.22]Restart.
[239:22.38]Load save.
[239:23.20]Wait.
[239:24.80]What do you mean load save?
[239:26.64]Eventually I'm going to get up there, aren't I?
[239:29.94]Aren't I going to get up there eventually?
[239:30.96]Shit.
[239:44.51]Fuck.
[239:45.87]Fuck, dude.
[239:46.71]No.
[239:48.80]No.
[239:52.28]No!
[239:54.27]Can I do it again?
[239:54.79]Can I do it twice?
[239:59.87]Let's see.
[240:03.85]I'm not loading the save.
[240:12.72]Anything over here?
[240:13.22]Is this where I came from or what?
[240:14.54]I got enough.
[240:21.11]I can do it.
[240:24.35]Yeah, I got enough.
[240:24.89]I've got 35.
[240:25.23]Alright, now what actually do I do?
[240:36.31]Probably open these somehow, right?
[241:00.74]How do we get over there?
[241:04.09]This.
[241:05.15]Okay, let's go.
[241:17.08]Nothing?
[241:17.36]Nothing.
[241:28.00]Authorized personnel only.
[241:30.79]is a key card of some sort that I don't have.
[241:32.68]Terminal authority, sure.
[241:47.51]He's alive.
[241:51.55]He's moving.
[241:52.19]The guy was clearly moving around.
[242:06.94]Alright, I'll try to do it.
[242:08.79]You have a security card?
[242:11.05]Perfect.
[242:15.37]Thank you!
[242:15.91]How's it going?
[242:45.35]I think it's the wrong door?
[242:46.27]Try this one.
[242:51.87]What does this thing do?
[243:06.77]Oh, it's nothing.
[243:12.32]Okay, whatever.
[243:23.19]Progress.
[243:34.62]It's alive!
[243:45.52]You can't be serious!
[243:56.43]I feel like I'm trying to kill a cockroach in my living room.
[244:01.16]God damn it, man.
[244:32.14]Look for, uh, resin.
[244:42.47]Let's go.
[244:44.73]What makes you wish for it?
[244:52.16]Big brain resin?
[244:53.26]Uh, this is a combine, okay?
[245:29.81]What's that?
[245:30.19]This motherfucker's stealing all the neighbor's internet.
[245:34.45]Oh, that's...simple.
[245:37.03]Okay.
[245:37.49]Sure.
[245:37.73]Done.
[246:08.22]Wait, is that a key card?
[246:09.18]Nice, okay.
[246:11.88]Do I still need this key card?
[246:14.50]Or can I... What about this key?
[246:19.20]Do I get rid of this key card?
[246:24.23]That's a lot of cables.
[246:27.99]Is that?
[246:28.23]What did I just throw?
[246:30.91]No, I want to... Where did the ammo go?
[246:47.13]Of the injector thing, but I don't need it.
[246:51.98]I don't need this at all.
[246:54.19]It's for fun.
[247:12.27]Do you guys remember?
[247:14.25]Some of you older viewers might remember the PSVR shit.
[247:18.27]Do you guys remember when I was playing the Batman game and the thing was so fucked up and so shitty and the calibration was so wrong that I could not reach my hand this far in front of me?
[247:27.10]I had to put a key into a safe and I physically couldn't do it.
[247:32.56]It feels so nice to actually be able to do this.
[247:40.55]It's fun to do that.
[247:42.03]Okay, I got that keycard, let's go.
[247:48.29]That should be for the other door.
[247:49.31]Healing, watch it.
[247:52.25]Um, they're gonna break through the ceiling.
[247:55.14]I mean, of course they're gonna break through the ceiling.
[248:04.70]Fuck you!
[248:09.18]Fuck you, dick.
[248:16.25]Let me see your face.
[248:16.87]Flip over.
[248:23.01]Flip over right now.
[248:24.79]Flip over.
[248:25.33]Flip over.
[248:27.22]You flip over.
[248:29.04]Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it.
[248:30.66]Hey, hey, hey, hey, drop it.
[248:31.88]What's he got?
[248:32.68]Drop it.
[248:33.94]Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it.
[248:35.80]Come on.
[248:36.86]What does he have in his mouth?
[248:43.73]Come here.
[248:45.79]Oh my god, alright, finally.
[248:46.68]Oh, that's not- Okay.
[248:50.90]Go for the vaults.
[248:51.82]Wait a minute, I just saw- Wow, I can play with this.
[249:29.02]Let's go!
[249:33.67]Pretend it's your dick.
[249:34.77]Oh!
[249:34.85]Are you... Are you eight?
[249:53.45]Here, hold this for me.
[250:19.69]Fucking disgusting, don't do it.
[250:23.75]Ooh, grenades.
[250:28.90]You sure this isn't measuring tape?
[250:52.01]Agreed.
[250:57.68]How much time do I- Ah!
[251:14.29]Oh no, this sucks.
[251:18.74]That was easy.
[251:19.40]That was simple.
[251:21.34]Why did I freak out?
[251:23.96]Fine, I'm gonna ask you.
[251:26.12]Holy shit, that's a lot of grenades.
[251:41.38]Did I get him?
[251:43.06]You can press both buttons.
[252:01.09]Oh!
[252:01.65]All in one!
[252:02.29]Where'd it go?
[252:08.54]Backpack only stores ammo and resin.
[252:13.74]Well, that's stupid.
[252:33.49]I see him.
[252:33.95]I got him.
[252:34.55]I got this motherfucker.
[252:35.53]Hold him.
[252:39.74]Hey, no.
[252:40.46]What?
[252:44.06]Hey, fellas!
[252:47.36]Heads up!
[252:50.73]Heads up, zombie.
[252:52.15]I said it first.
[252:52.99]I went... Look out.
[253:04.37]Goodbye.
[253:08.01]Who else is down there?
[253:10.71]Who else am I throwing water balloons at?
[253:18.72]Oh no.
[253:20.98]Oh no.
[253:26.17]What makes me a good Demoman?
[253:27.85]If I were a bad Demoman.
[253:31.70]I wouldn't be sitting in here discussing it with you now, would I?
[253:34.85]It's aim.
[253:51.00]It's godlike.
[253:52.28]It's vision.
[253:53.00]True.
[253:54.18]Oh, I didn't... What a waste of fucking bullets.
[254:04.15]Hey, excuse me.
[254:11.91]I just dropped it.
[254:14.65]I know, Jim Carrey.
[254:15.83]That's all I know.
[254:18.49]What do you want me to say?
[254:19.25]What do you want me to say?
[254:22.41]Ring the box?
[254:25.49]Fucking stop.
[254:26.25]I know, I grew huge again.
[254:31.29]Why am I so big again?
[254:32.47]Alright, so now what?
[254:42.54]100 volts.
[254:47.68]Alright, how do I, what the fuck do I do?
[254:56.09]I can't wait to hear it.
[254:57.29]I can't wait to hear it.
[255:00.50]That hasn't been in the game yet.
[255:03.62]I thought it would have been there the first like 10 minutes.
[255:23.78]Is it a dud?
[255:34.34]Thank you.
[256:21.83]There's 39 of these things.
[256:22.99]Break shit.
[256:24.09]You have a grenade.
[256:24.87]Break shit.
[256:25.35]Yeah, I know, but I don't want to waste it.
[256:42.58]Break shit.
[256:43.38]Break shit.
[256:43.92]Don't tell him.
[256:45.50]Tell him what?
[256:59.32]Have one shot.
[257:00.94]And you missed.
[257:02.86]And you missed!
[257:04.88]Don't blame me for your mistake.
[257:23.83]Hey, can you open the door?
[257:27.03]Open the door.
[257:29.37]Open the door!
[257:31.85]Open the door!
[257:34.94]Open the door!
[257:35.64]He doesn't hear me.
[257:47.82]We got him.
[257:54.85]This is still kind of fun to do, though.
[257:55.85]They're not...
[258:20.40]Oh, what?
[258:27.80]Are you serious?
[258:32.90]What happened there?
[258:41.57]Got my fidget spinners.
[258:48.23]Oh!
[258:52.33]Remember that shit?
[258:52.89]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[259:03.58]What's wrong with you?
[259:10.09]Fuck.
[259:14.61]What does this woman do?
[259:16.53]So many grenades!
[259:23.80]Where's the damn power source?
[259:24.90]Where is it?
[259:25.26]Okay.
[259:38.62]Later.
[259:51.40]Oh, press the button.
[259:52.78]Whoops.
[259:53.46]Press the button first.
[259:58.14]I win.
[260:02.46]I'll take a couple of these for later.
[260:06.44]I mean, there's so many of them.
[260:07.87]Why not just... Who cares?
[260:09.91]Check a room before you go in.
[260:11.15]Like, fuck it.
[260:12.19]It doesn't even matter.
[260:15.69]Give me this one, too.
[260:16.61]Whatever.
[260:17.09]Like, I'm just gonna throw it around.
[260:21.15]Any enemies down that fucking hallway?
[260:23.17]Not anymore.
[260:23.71]Huh?
[260:29.97]Laser sight.
[260:30.79]They coming?
[260:31.63]Where are they?
[260:33.53]Oh fuck, hurry up.
[260:47.67]Open!
[260:48.95]Before they get down here.
[261:18.62]Red dot sight.
[261:19.26]Let's go.
[261:27.63]Laser sight.
[261:29.01]Yes, I will take one of those, please.
[261:42.54]That's a lot.
[261:44.12]I hope this is worth it.
[261:55.80]Wow, my gun's looking pretty good.
[261:58.56]Rats, come on.
[262:00.02]At this point, it's kind of a boss gun.
[262:01.48]Oh, that's so good.
[262:03.70]Good.
[262:17.35]Here, man.
[262:31.80]What did I do?

[262:42.83]After this.
[262:44.63]What the fuck did I do?
[262:47.79]What just happened?
[262:54.45]What?
[262:58.93]I shut it off.
[262:59.64]What did I shut off?
[263:14.16]Should I take that now?
[263:16.40]Oh, not yet.
[263:17.08]I want some of those grenades, though.
[263:22.68]A couple left, right?
[263:24.60]One grenade left.
[263:25.18]I'm gonna need this.

[264:48.33]Alright, now I know.
[264:51.85]Now I'm only going to be grenade guy.
[264:57.40]I'm going to throw these down there.

[266:10.81]Anything?
[266:11.11]I can't take anything from him?
[266:15.42]Can't take anything off his belt?
[266:16.56]He has a bunch of shit on him.

[269:23.04]Ready?
[269:24.68]I don't get anything.
[269:26.06]I don't get anything.
[269:28.10]Hey.
[269:53.83]Um, should I even use the healing right now?
[269:55.85]I don't think I need it.
[269:59.53]I think it's been more than 30 minutes.
[270:00.69]That's fine.
[270:01.11]That's alright.
[270:03.67]I'm still alright.
[270:04.17]A lot of grenades everywhere.
[270:09.01]For some reason, why?
[270:10.11]Oh shit, he's alive!
[270:42.91]Oh, got him.

[271:39.29]The editor. Whoever is doing it.
[271:43.29]Oh, by the way, if it's not there you're fired.
[271:54.29]I'm kidding!
[272:07.86]What's going on in here?
[272:15.53]What's going on here?
[272:27.00]Oh, I can use it.
[272:27.62]I might as well fill up to full health then.
[272:38.00]My sweat is dripping down into my nose.
[272:43.43]No people on Twitch even do it.
[272:44.99]Imagine the smell.
[273:03.78]Alright, guys.
[273:04.94]The guys up here have no idea what's about to happen.
[273:09.63]I'm gonna get up here.
[273:10.35]I'm gonna... I'm gonna throw a grenade around the corner.
[274:05.57]Wait, there's two of them!
[274:14.00]Oh shit!
[274:18.20]That's what the grenades are for.
[274:24.19]Gonna be like a fucking mystery magic act for a children's birthday party.
[274:36.39]You have two wrist pockets?
[274:37.77]I do?
[274:38.05]I thought I only had one.
[274:39.17]Alright, here we go.
[274:54.68]No fucking around, this is it right here.
[275:19.07]Get the hell the fuck down in there, man.
[275:27.02]Alright, shotgun.
[275:28.45]And bolt!
[276:43.58]Good!
[276:45.32]Do a Fortnite dance?
[276:52.94]Sure thing.
[276:53.98]Sure thing!
[276:54.46]Remember these?
[277:11.69]Got them back.
[277:14.25]Nice.
[277:14.57]I knew I was gonna end up over here.
[277:15.67]Now what?
[277:31.93]The Northern Star!
[277:32.81]That's where he wanted me to go!
[277:36.93]Why are you saying it like that?
[277:38.57]No, no.
[277:39.65]The Vortigaunt said, look to the Northern Star to help his friends.
[277:43.17]Which sounds like Vortigaunt nonsense, but I guess it isn't.
[277:47.52]Oh, yeah.
[277:48.14]I thought I said it.
[277:48.70]I don't make more sense.
[277:51.12]I move?
[277:54.74]That's some sort of combined substation.
[277:57.24]They usually generate power in the home.
[277:58.72]That was just the beginning of an acid race.
[278:00.72]Like the power and security you need for a giant vault.
[278:09.85]I'm gonna go to bed.
[278:10.81]I'm doing alright.
[278:12.31]I will in a minute.
[278:14.73]I'm almost at like a checkpoint, right?
[278:16.21]Alright, I'm gonna stop.
[278:21.64]I'm gonna stop.
[278:22.02]When I get to a checkpoint.
[278:22.66]I don't know where the next checkpoint is.
[278:40.26]Shit.
[278:49.89]Not gonna hide shit from me, dude.
[278:57.91]Oh, I don't have two wrist slots.
[279:00.03]I thought you guys said I had two.
[279:01.15]You guys lied to me.
[279:09.73]Alright, hotel arc incoming.
[279:10.51]Alright, here we go.
[279:11.11]Alright, there's nothing fucking in here.
[279:39.70]Alright, there we go.
[279:41.00]Hotel.
[279:41.34]I'm in the hotel now.
[279:43.34]Now I can stop.
[279:50.02]You could have killed someone.
[279:52.72]Okay, now we can stop.
[279:53.87]That was a ton of fun.
[279:57.19]This is great.
[279:58.99]I understand why everyone says this is the game to play.
[280:02.63]It's very, very fun.
[280:03.93]It's very fun.
[280:07.01]Just fun.
[280:07.57]Fun.
[280:09.37]It's not too overbearing.
[280:10.89]Sometimes you stay in these games for like three or four hours and it gets delayed.
[280:14.21]This is good.
[280:15.17]This is solid.
[280:15.77]I just want to see what's inside here.
[280:21.40]Okay, I'm done.
[280:23.74]I'm done.
[280:24.00]I'm done.
[280:24.38]I'm done.
[280:24.80]That was cool.
[280:26.80]And the power's out.
[280:30.18]Looks like we're taking a stair.
[280:31.22]Alright, save.
[280:35.64]Northern Star, Chapter 5.
[280:37.26]The Northern Star...
[280:38.95]That's, this one's good, right?
[280:39.85]This save right there?
[280:40.39]Yeah, we're good.
[280:40.77]Alright.
[280:40.99]Is this a piano? Is this a piano?
[280:42.93]Alright, I gotta play, okay, wait, wait, wait. Nobody move I- somebody- there's a piano.
[281:04.31]I don't even care I just want to play the piano, I don't care.
[281:14.31]Get the fuck off me!
[281:16.05]Hey.
[281:16.21]Hey.
[281:16.65]Hey.
[281:21.64]Hey.
[281:25.76]I don't care.
[281:30.24]Hey, Russ.
[281:31.31]Name a song.
[281:32.23]Fight of the Bumblebee.
[281:33.47]Coming right up.
[281:34.07]That's it.
[281:55.13]Don't ever have children and have a piano in the house.
[281:59.13]I just want to make sure I warned everybody about that because you'll get this.
[282:10.00]They'll do it every day dude. Every single day.
[282:15.70]It's not enough.
[282:16.96]It's not good enough.
[282:19.05]Oh, that's not going to get me anything.
[282:20.91]I won't win the Grammy.
[282:21.95]Open this fucking thing up.
[282:28.22]Oh, that was fun.
[282:45.66]Alright, see you guys later.
[282:46.40]See you this weekend.
[282:54.43]I can't get out.
[282:55.25]I can't leave.
[282:56.91]I can't leave.
[282:57.81]I'm stuck.
[283:00.11]Get out.
[283:02.15]Alright, I'm out.
[283:02.93]I'm out.
[283:03.43]I'm out.
[283:03.63]I'm out.
[283:04.01]I'm out.
[283:04.87]I'm out.
[283:07.21]That was a lot of fun.
[283:09.66]Oh, yeah.
[283:10.10]Now that I come out.
[283:10.74]Oh, yeah.
[283:11.62]I die.
[283:12.36]He's taking his sub, right?
[283:14.97]I'm going to just take a cheese sub and take a shower.
[283:23.31]I have two slots on each wrist.
[283:26.37]Go ahead.
[283:26.61]Yeah, it's been almost five hours.
[283:31.94]I'm surprised.
[283:32.50]That was fun.
[283:33.46]Alright, I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[283:40.90]We'll come back with something else.
[283:45.68]You were in there for a while.
[283:46.56]Yeah, I was.
[283:47.10]I only took, like, two breaks, too.
[283:48.56]I usually take, like, five.
[283:53.97]We'll see how I feel.
[283:54.57]I mean, they're gonna come back on Saturday with Alex, so we'll do some of the VR stuff.
[283:57.97]Or we might take a break from VR and then come back on Sunday.
[284:00.07]I don't know.
[284:00.45]It's all set up, so I might as well do it.
[284:03.17]He's never gonna play this again.
[284:04.45]That would be fucked up.
[284:09.72]But here come the subs.
[284:10.52]Thanks, everybody.
[284:11.10]Actually, let me see.
[284:11.76]I probably missed some shit.
[284:13.88]I did.
[284:14.22]I did.
[284:17.30]There was a huge amount of money given a little while ago.
[284:19.94]$250.
[284:21.08]What the fuck?
[284:25.28]$250 in bits.
[284:26.42]25,000 bits from Foxy Muffin.
[284:32.04]That's insane.
[284:35.81]Thanks for the ridiculous amount of money.
[284:38.13]An amount of money that I can't believe any one human would give one human to me.
[284:44.23]That's too much.
[284:44.77]That's a lot.
[284:46.77]Thank you.
[284:49.54]We had five community subs from JermaSucks, which is part of the ones you're seeing now.
[284:53.98]Ten community subs from TheMySQ, and then five community subs from Bocuck.
[285:00.42]Thank you.
[285:02.60]Thanks a lot, guys.
[285:04.91]VR, I'm so glad to be back in VR, because it's... It's just pure fun.
[285:10.97]It takes kind of a lot out of you, but it's just fun.
[285:14.51]I missed it.
[285:15.31]I'm so glad to be back in it.
[285:32.56]Raid, raid, raid.

[286:52.50]Sark is awesome.
[286:55.16]You guys know, okay, let me tell you a quick little story.
[286:57.94]So back when I was, I had like, maybe like 50,000 subs on YouTube.
[287:04.74]I went to like a party, like a machinima party.
[287:07.15]And I didn't fucking know anybody.
[287:09.19]I was just like a guy that was there.
[287:11.25]I guess I'm like a YouTube partner.
[287:14.21]And I remember Mr. Sark.
[287:16.69]I was, we're at a balcony and he kind of looked over at me and he was like, Hey, Jerma!
[287:22.13]I was like, what?
[287:23.95]You, you know who I am?
[287:25.57]How, how is it possible?
[287:27.99]And he was like, yeah, you, I love your stuff.
[287:30.11]You keep going, man.
[287:30.97]You're doing great.
[287:33.79]When you get that kind of encouragement, it's like, holy shit, this is like Mr. Sark.
[287:37.97]He's saying that about me?
[287:38.95]He's a really, really good dude.
[287:45.24]I don't know anybody.
[287:46.18]I still kind of don't, but you know.
[287:54.46]Everybody clapped.
[287:59.03]And then he chokeslammed you off the balcony.
[288:01.97]And said, never talk to me ever again.
[288:06.61]No, he is like... He is a top-notch gentleman.
[288:13.28]So go say hello.
[288:16.30]Thanks for all the subs, everybody, and thanks for the huge amounts of money.
[288:19.98]I'll be back on Saturday and Sunday.
[288:22.66]We'll do something fun.
[288:24.40]In the meantime, have a great rest of your night.
