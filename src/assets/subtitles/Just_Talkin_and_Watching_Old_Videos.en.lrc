[00:11.97]What a sesh.
[00:14.36]What a gym sesh, man.
[00:15.62]I was in the wrong spot.
[00:17.80]That was tough.
[00:25.90]So how was he?
[00:26.52]Was he funny?
[00:30.10]He was not that much money.
[00:31.22]So wait, he brought candles here too?
[00:37.88]Yankee candle.
[00:41.39]Was he scary?
[00:44.90]Don't want those burning for a while.
[00:46.10]Something's wrong with the white balance.
[00:49.76]I'll fix it.
[00:59.24]That's better, right?
[01:03.40]Oh, free drink!
[01:10.04]Oh my god, that taste.
[01:11.80]That taste like mushrooms.
[01:16.98]What the fuck?
[01:17.72]Alright, but anyways.
[01:19.80]Hope you guys enjoyed that.
[01:22.94]That guy was a last minute addition here.
[01:25.85]Because if you don't know the problems that I've been having.
[01:28.81]Somebody had to stream today.
[01:30.09]I've been upstairs at the Hornets.
[01:34.09]I had a couple of plans that fell through because I haven't been able to do them.
[01:40.02]But let me move this over here.
[01:43.88]I can't even see.
[01:47.12]Well, I mean, I was only in the gym for like 15 minutes.
[01:50.09]I left immediately.
[01:51.15]I tried to do like three pull-ups and I just fucking went home.
[01:58.41]It's okay, though.
[02:01.59]So we're just going to hang out for the remainder.
[02:06.10]With the Ridley Hornets?
[02:06.88]Oh, yeah.
[02:07.48]I'll talk about that right now.
[02:08.70]Come on.
[02:09.18]Give me this.
[02:10.70]It is hot in here.
[02:12.79]It is hot in here.
[02:15.89]Let me take that.
[02:26.19]Okay.
[02:27.80]Why is there like coffee pastas all over this?
[02:30.86]I met Jerma.
[02:31.42]I saw Jerma in the donut shop.
[02:32.62]He was buying donuts.
[02:33.44]I asked him to sign my donut.
[02:34.42]He's supposed to be reading scary.
[02:38.36]Did he read scary stories?
[02:39.34]What the fuck is he doing?
[02:48.99]They were scary, okay.
[02:51.88]I'm just making sure that he, you know, he was $41, so.
[02:54.36]Alright, so let's talk about the bees for a minute.
[03:01.74]I gotta change the stream title here.
[03:05.10]This is not happening anymore.
[03:06.10]I'm just gonna, Just Talking is the name of this stream.
[03:20.40]Why did that not update?
[03:22.06]I don't know.
[03:25.47]Jermacraft?
[03:29.37]Hey, look at the house.
[03:29.99]Remember the house I built?
[03:30.85]Alright, so let's talk about the bees.
[03:36.38]That was not a joke.
[03:37.18]A lot of people thought I was just making that up.
[03:38.68]People were like, oh, man, so bees took over your house?
[03:42.66]Yeah.
[03:43.73]It wasn't bees, though.
[03:44.45]It was hornets.
[03:46.03]Let's go over it.
[03:47.55]So two nights ago, two mornings ago, I woke up.
[03:52.85]And you know when you're just sleeping and you're in a dead sleep and you start to hear something really fucking terrifying and scary and you don't know what it is, but you don't wake up.
[04:01.55]You're just still just sitting there.
[04:02.67]You're like, I don't care whatever the problem is.
[04:04.61]I'm too tired to give a shit.
[04:05.65]That's what was happening.
[04:07.43]And this is what I was hearing.
[04:10.17]You'll know this exact sound that I'm talking about.
[04:13.35]When a large insect is like, maybe your eyes are closed here.
[04:17.34]These are your eyes.
[04:18.22]They're closed.
[04:21.02]this smashing into the window sound don't no stop wait what what what what what what what happened what happened what happened hold on oh go ahead oh okay okay hold on hold on hold on okay hold on oh there were bits during that okay hold on I thought something was wrong with the stream
[04:50.99]Let's move this over here for now.
[04:53.43]Okay, let's see.
[04:54.35]Bits.
[04:56.29]Bits, bits, bits.
[05:05.81]Too scary.
[05:07.67]Is this a scenario where Streamlabs does not have anything before 20 minutes ago?
[05:15.36]I'm a little quiet today.
[05:17.08]I'm sorry.
[05:25.41]What was the first bit donation today?
[05:27.22]Because I have from 21 minutes ago.
[05:40.90]Oh, nothing?
[05:41.87]Oh, okay.
[05:44.85]I'm very quiet.
[05:45.99]Hold on, let me turn myself up.
[05:50.23]Is that better?
[05:51.55]It should be louder now.
[05:53.30]Am I louder?
[05:54.10]If not, I'll have to figure that out.
[05:59.84]Oh, there we go.
[06:00.44]Now we're good.
[06:02.40]I don't have anything from more than 20 minutes ago, but what the fuck was that noise?
[06:06.91]Is he still here?
[06:10.05]But the B story, right?
[06:11.01]So when I was sleeping two nights ago, I just kept hearing this noise.
[06:23.96]You know, I actually thought it was electricity.
[06:28.80]Oh, you guys are telling me to stop turning the camera.
[06:30.54]No, but I was like giving you, I was making you guys not be able to see.
[06:36.02]You guys are confusing me.
[06:37.26]I thought like you guys are telling me to stop.
[06:39.16]Don't wait, hold on.
[06:40.02]Don't stream yet.
[06:43.58]But regardless of how awfully I'm telling the story because I'm getting caught up in stammering in the middle of it.
[06:49.39]Hornets, there's a hornet's nest in my wall.
[06:52.27]In my kitchen.
[06:54.13]In the light outside, there's a nest.
[06:57.04]And I had my property power washed because obviously I'm moving and I'm trying to make it as livable as possible.
[07:06.06]I want to make it nice.
[07:07.33]And they found it.
[07:08.97]And they've agitated it.
[07:10.87]And they kind of maybe pushed it in a little.
[07:14.10]And now this hornet's nest with fucking dozens and dozens and dozens and dozens of hornets has been stuffed into my wall.
[07:22.16]And now they're just scattering around my fucking house.
[07:28.24]So every hour up until about four or five hours ago, because the pest guy came and he like pumped a bunch of powder into my wall and he's like, I don't take care of them.
[07:39.90]And they're not bees, by the way, they are hornets, they're wasps.
[07:43.09]So it's not a situation where I could have had somebody come out and relocate the hive of honeybees.
[07:49.95]No, it was wasps.
[07:52.15]So every hour I've heard that awful sound in my bedroom of bees swarming around and smacking into the window.
[08:00.21]And here's the funny thing about bees.
[08:01.88]You wanna know like a fucking thing about bees?
[08:05.58]I feel like bees are how I would react
[08:09.77]or like in the reverse, right?
[08:11.27]Like, you know, like people online that talk a bunch of shit.
[08:15.43]They're like, ah, you're a fucking loser.
[08:17.01]You're a wuss.
[08:18.05]Ah, yeah, why don't you go fuck yourself, right?
[08:19.52]I feel like, I feel like the bee is like confronting the online bully.
[08:25.90]You know what I'm saying?
[08:26.86]Like a bee is, when you see a bee, it's like, I don't want anything to do with you.
[08:31.13]I'm terrified of you.
[08:31.89]Please get out of my house.
[08:33.51]But like, if I was talking to somebody about bees, I'd be like, yeah, they're fucking dumb.
[08:37.49]Who cares?
[08:39.57]You talk a bunch of shit about bees until you have to see one in your house.
[08:45.41]Loud?
[08:45.91]Wait, loud.
[08:48.82]What happened to my mic?
[08:49.68]Why is my mic fucking broken?
[08:54.84]Oh, God damn it.
[08:56.02]Did I like break this microphone?
[09:10.45]Hold on a minute.
[09:10.96]Give me a second.
[09:48.29]Okay.
[09:49.41]We're good.
[09:51.93]I'm so sorry about that.
[09:54.67]Oh, let me make sure.
[09:55.27]Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro, Figaro.
[09:57.33]I'm not peaking, right?
[10:00.17]Okay.
[10:02.39]That joke already happened.
[10:03.37]I'm not doing a joke.
[10:05.81]I actually might have just fucked up my mic.
[10:10.94]But anyways, this is on top of the fact that I've been feeling really shitty lately.
[10:16.26]I've had a bad headache
[10:18.16]I've had really bad back pain I've just been everything's been sucking and a bunch of shit in my house has been going uh into the toilet and I mean that both literally and figuratively so uh sorry that it's been a little erratic it's not my intention but I couldn't stream yesterday or the day before and I'm even paranoid about it now because they're scattering they're just coming into random parts of the house
[10:47.24]Remember when I was streamed in the toilet broke and it was shit was just bleeding into my the water was falling from the ceiling I have this horrible horrible nightmare scenario where I'm gonna be streaming for like an hour or two a couple hours go by and these powder were sprayed into the wall and I'm gonna go upstairs and it's gonna be like I'm so paranoid about it Bees falling from the ceiling
[11:16.04]Thankfully, it's almost over.
[11:17.32]We're almost done.
[11:20.16]I only have about three or four weeks before it's over.
[11:24.95]Place has been cleaned up.
[11:26.25]I'm trying to take care of as much shit as I can.
[11:30.85]The house is cursed.
[11:31.57]Yeah, I made a joke on Twitter that I feel like I'm the demon in this house.
[11:35.53]Like, there's a family of seven that lives here.
[11:39.59]And I don't even see them.
[11:40.67]I died like 25 years ago and I'm just in the house.
[11:44.89]Opening up the fridge, they hear weird noises from the basement at fucking 7, 8 o'clock.
[11:51.55]Eventually, like, you know, it's been weird.
[11:53.35]I've noticed, I've heard people talking in this house before.
[11:58.17]In my dreams and shit.
[11:59.29]Like, I think they're trying to exorcise me.
[12:02.22]And I won't leave.
[12:03.98]Well, it's working now.
[12:05.38]I'm going to go haunt somebody else in Vegas.
[12:11.68]But sometimes I really do think that.
[12:12.96]It's weird because everyone, I see people talk about, oh, you're so unlucky.
[12:17.74]How can you be so unlucky?
[12:20.02]I'm not, though.
[12:21.20]I'm very lucky.
[12:22.24]I'm a very lucky person.
[12:26.05]Just awful dumb shit happens one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight in a row to me.
[12:32.09]I can go years of absolute, total, perfect, no problems at all.
[12:38.19]And then one time after like a year or so, once every couple of years, it's just in a row.
[12:46.49]And I can't handle all of them at the same time.
[12:51.67]Misfortunes come in two.
[12:52.83]Well, in my case, they come in like a six pack.
[12:56.61]I get a fucking Bud Light misfortune pack.
[13:06.02]People were expecting some joke today.
[13:08.10]That's what I think of.
[13:08.78]I was laughing about that.
[13:09.74]It's, oh, whoa, he's talking about this bee thing.
[13:12.56]He's going to like put a bunch of fake bees in his room.
[13:14.92]Like I wish that was the scenario.
[13:18.49]I was upstairs just like clenching my fist together.
[13:20.61]Just like.
[13:25.13]Nobody wants hornets in their house every 30 to 40 minutes.
[13:28.75]Just one comes in through a vent.
[13:31.39]Because hornets are mean.
[13:32.61]They're aggressive.
[13:33.27]They're not bees.
[13:34.03]They're mean little shits.
[13:40.61]But regardless, that's why it's been a little erratic.
[13:43.23]But for those of you that don't really want to stick around, and this stream was not going to be very long.
[13:50.30]I just, I didn't have much planned.
[13:51.44]I haven't been able to plan the things I want to plan.
[13:54.38]And it's really fucking irritating.
[13:56.80]So you hire some psycho to come to your house and read shitty, scary meme pastas.
[14:10.15]Nice Star Wars shirt.
[14:11.82]What's wrong with my shirt?
[14:13.30]You don't like my shirt?
[14:19.34]Hornet on the wall.
[14:21.90]Fire.
[14:23.44]Somebody edit that.
[14:24.18]Hold on.
[14:25.56]Can somebody edit this?
[14:26.66]Some of you guys is talented, right?
[14:27.94]You can do this.
[14:28.86]Have a hornet land right there.
[14:32.40]And then I'm going to do like a snap like Colonel Mustang from Fullmetal Alchemist.
[14:39.19]It's already watched.
[14:42.28]So I think the thing about... I think going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[14:48.67]Oh, shit.
[14:48.99]Hold on.
[14:49.27]Wait, wait, wait.
[14:49.57]Hold on.
[14:51.09]There he is.
[14:51.89]Wait till he lands.
[14:52.41]Wait till he lands.
[14:55.15]Okay, he landed.
[14:59.19]Ooh, up in smoke.
[15:03.66]Did you see that?
[15:04.32]Look at these park champs.
[15:08.74]That's some dumb shit.
[15:09.68]Yeah, it was.
[15:11.99]Now one of you talented guys make me a fucking little gif.
[15:18.08]But yeah, I'm sorry.
[15:19.18]I wanted to play a blind legend, but I wanted to do some stuff.
[15:24.30]I wanted to put, I was going to get a green screen for that and like put up like forests and shit behind me.
[15:29.84]I was going to do a whole thing and I haven't had any time to do it.
[15:32.90]The emotes have to be fucking put in here.
[15:35.28]I sat down here for the first time without panicking about something for two days in a row.
[15:46.47]Your stream froze right as I snapped.
[15:49.83]No spoilers?
[15:50.57]That's not a spoiler.
[15:51.41]That's just a set piece.
[15:57.13]I'm buying so much stuff before I move.
[16:00.78]That doesn't mean... What?
[16:01.52]You don't think it's coming with me?
[16:06.80]Back to GeoGuessr.
[16:12.40]Bring the bees with me.
[16:14.68]Uh, I don't say that.
[16:16.06]Don't jinx me with bees.
[16:19.40]But, um, here's the plan.
[16:23.70]The plan is, tomorrow, uh, Overcooked 2 with Etalyx.
[16:29.66]That's a game that we played before and it's really fun.
[16:32.52]We'll get a lot of good shit out of that game, I think.
[16:35.30]And then, on Sunday, what was I gonna do on Sunday?
[16:44.53]Oh, my God, my brain.
[16:47.36]You see what I'm talking about here?
[16:48.48]Like, my brain is on overdrive.
[16:50.30]I can't even think straight.
[16:53.84]What the hell was it?
[16:55.26]I, like, said it already in this chat, like, four hours ago.
[17:03.37]Somebody was here.
[17:04.35]Oh, the Labo, right?
[17:05.23]Okay, no, no, we're not doing the Labo on Sunday.
[17:06.75]We're going to do... Well, I'll try to get a Blind Legend ready for Sunday.
[17:11.51]So we're going to do... Tomorrow is...
[17:16.41]Overcooked 2.
[17:16.77]And then I'm going to get to Blind Legend on Sunday.
[17:21.09]And then I'm scared to stream the Labo.
[17:23.65]I am.
[17:24.55]I'm terrified to do it.
[17:27.00]We've had two Labo streams.
[17:28.80]And on one of them I was drunk.
[17:30.42]So I didn't realize everybody hated it.
[17:32.70]And on the second one I was as sober as a stone.
[17:34.94]And everyone was talking about how much they fucking hated it.
[17:37.22]So I don't know.
[17:37.74]I got a whole $80 box back here.
[17:39.60]It's still there.
[17:40.54]It hasn't moved.
[17:42.26]I have to build that at some point.
[17:46.81]Should I just, like, drink again and, like, just pretend?
[17:49.29]Like, I thought you guys were having a blast.
[17:51.79]I was told after that stream that, no, man, we fucking hated that shit.
[17:56.52]Like, goddamn.
[18:01.04]Hopefully you guys liked it.
[18:02.12]So should I just get drunk again and...
[18:07.08]put together a kid's cardboard robot on, like, Wednesday?
[18:11.62]God, I hate hearing that.
[18:14.22]Hey, guys, should I get drunk on a Wednesday and play with kids' toys?
[18:18.56]Say that out loud.
[18:19.38]Say it out loud a few times.
[18:21.52]I'm gonna say it out loud a few more times.
[18:25.65]Remember, I'm 32.
[18:26.03]Hey, guys, you want me to get drunk on Wednesday and play with a children's cardboard toy?
[18:36.93]Maybe if I say it enough times, like I'll wake up.
[18:44.09]You don't have to be drunk.
[18:46.53]I was drunk the first night.
[18:47.79]No, I wasn't even drunk.
[18:48.69]I had like two shitty cooking wines.
[18:50.52]I wasn't like, I was a little on the, you know, I was a little over the edge.
[18:55.92]I had like a bottle of Jameson too.
[18:58.06]Whatever.
[19:02.26]It's Thursday.
[19:03.96]Yeah.
[19:04.06]Well, tomorrow's Friday.
[19:04.78]We're doing overcooked too.
[19:06.27]And then Sunday we're going to do a blind legend.
[19:11.88]Don't wear shorts.
[19:13.48]Oh, don't.
[19:13.90]I got a plan.
[19:14.58]Don't worry.
[19:16.94]Wear a goddamn suit of armor below my waist.
[19:23.02]Eat a hornet.
[19:26.46]Destroy all humans too.
[19:29.19]That's on the back burner.
[19:31.97]That's probably not going to happen.
[19:33.95]There's too many other things.
[19:35.97]There's two streams in particular.
[19:40.65]One of them is making progress.
[19:43.64]I wish I could just say it.
[19:45.86]I want to.
[19:47.30]Because I think it's going to be so much fun.
[19:53.00]I'm not going to say it.
[19:54.10]But it's getting there.
[19:57.46]It's getting there.
[19:59.21]It's not something I've ever said before.
[20:00.79]It wasn't something I said on a podcast.
[20:02.69]It's not something I've ever said.
[20:12.22]Balls spotted.
[20:15.76]Are you talking about R2-D2?
[20:18.28]Because he don't have any.
[20:23.18]Wait, does he?
[20:29.53]He does.
[20:36.03]Give a hint.
[20:36.55]I've given a hint already.
[20:38.71]Something that you guys will be participating in.
[20:40.41]That's all the hint.
[20:41.05]That's the only thing you get.
[20:43.31]You all, everyone, will be participating in this stream.
[20:50.18]Everyone that comes.
[20:54.00]It has nothing to do with anything I've said on a podcast, so get that out of your head.
[20:59.21]It's not that.
[21:00.77]It's something else.
[21:02.15]I have not talked about it.
[21:10.50]Give us shirts.
[21:11.30]There is a shirt that's coming.
[21:13.96]A shirt that's been in the works for over a year.
[21:16.66]And I just haven't finalized it.
[21:19.98]I haven't pulled the trigger on getting it done.
[21:21.30]But there's a new shirt coming.
[21:24.00]Probably at some point by the end of the summer.
[21:27.24]Or maybe into the early fall it'll be out.
[21:34.49]What about the main channel?
[21:35.73]I've talked about the main channel a few times.
[21:39.95]I got involved with too many things.
[21:43.03]that looked very promising.
[21:45.07]I kind of shot myself in the foot.
[21:50.34]Because YouTube was like this, right?
[21:53.50]There was a period where YouTube was going like this.
[21:55.93]Everything was great.
[21:57.13]Hey, we're like here at my point in YouTube.
[22:00.27]Oh, you know, I want to start making a bunch of high production stuff and put a bunch of time and money into my videos.
[22:05.57]Oh, okay, wait, hold on.
[22:06.63]YouTube's site started to suck absolute asshole.
[22:09.49]Oh, they started to like demonetize people.
[22:11.61]Whoa, they like are really starting to... The views and sub counts are fucked up.
[22:15.84]Whoa, hold on a sec.
[22:16.80]Like...
[22:18.02]Right when I wanted to do all that shit on the main channel is when all the YouTube Nonsense where they started to ruin the entire site started to happen.
[22:25.46]So I announced hey here comes a bunch of high production It's shot into the ground like not even a week or two after I made that first or second video So I figured I'm just gonna combine the ideas
[22:46.11]This platform is going to see more high production content live.
[22:50.27]I feel like I'm already here.
[22:52.63]The main channel, I really like don't, I didn't want to abandon it.
[22:57.05]I didn't want to say, oh yeah, that's the end.
[22:58.94]I talked about this on that official podcast on Critical's podcast.
[23:04.80]It was never my intention to not make videos on YouTube anymore.
[23:08.14]It just became something that wasn't making any sense anymore.
[23:13.48]It just wasn't.
[23:18.84]Upload your highlights there.
[23:19.88]I already have a highlight channel.
[23:21.48]It's very well upkept.
[23:23.76]There's really, really talented people helping and editing all those videos.
[23:28.39]I think it's in a good place.
[23:29.35]I don't want to mess with that formula.
[23:35.13]Spider-Man checkup.
[23:36.25]I can't do another checkup video.
[23:38.43]Somebody will throw a rock in my window.
[23:40.96]I can't do that.
[23:41.82]It's not going to happen.
[23:42.74]I'm not going to make another checkup update video.
[23:50.15]Do it.
[23:53.33]But here's the thing.
[23:54.71]That Jerma985 main channel, right?
[23:58.53]I would rather just have it preserved as that place where a ton of the stuff there I love and it's a huge part of my life.
[24:08.63]I really don't want to make it a joke where I spit in people's faces like, oh, hey, haven't seen an upload in two years.
[24:14.55]Hey, here's another update.
[24:15.79]Spider-Man 3.
[24:17.29]Fuck you.
[24:18.45]I'd rather not do that.
[24:24.12]I'd rather not make that piss people off with that because people will get angry with that.
[24:29.82]If I make that a joke, I think people wouldn't think that was funny at this point because it's been like three years.
[24:41.40]to have a proper funeral no it's just in a vault it's just it's not dead it's just preserved like when you buy yogurt you you know you can put it in the fridge for a long time it's preserved there's organisms that keep that shit alive it's I mean you could this bio chemical in there
[25:13.64]There's biochemical in there.
[25:15.96]Probiotics, the point I'm trying to make is that, I'm gonna keep that there as a vault.
[25:22.67]If for some reason I decide, alright, it's time to make something there, I wanna do something there for some reason, I will.
[25:29.43]It's just too many things clicked in opposite directions.
[25:33.46]Too many things fell through.
[25:34.76]There were plans that I've talked about more than once
[25:40.15]production and moving to Los Angeles and no that didn't work out it almost did it's just a lot of things didn't happen so take that what you will but you could argue that a lot of the stuff that you missed from the main channel is just here
[26:04.84]Haven't really changed up the formula for how I produce content how I do things on Twitch is what I would do on YouTube just a longer form And especially some of the stuff that is just random Sketches or skits that I want to do that I would have done on YouTube.
[26:23.27]Anyways, I just do them here And just wait till you see the next few things I
[26:33.29]Cause I'm turning it up.
[26:34.11]I'm wearing like a five right now.
[26:37.55]The things you've already seen, just wait like a few weeks.
[26:41.01]We're going up to a six.
[26:42.27]Whoa, hold on.
[26:43.76]You gotta wake the neighbors with that one.
[26:45.20]Oh, don't go eat.
[26:46.10]Whoa.
[26:46.34]We're going from a four to a six.
[26:52.92]And then when we get to Vegas, that six is going to a 6.8.
[26:56.06]And then we're going to cross like seven.
[27:00.25]At that point, you could have a few friends over and have a couple of drinks and have a little party.
[27:06.98]I've said wait a week for a year.
[27:10.10]Well, that's why I'm moving.
[27:16.22]It's... For all the shit that I want to do, it's not possible here.
[27:20.68]It's just, it is physically impossible to try to do anything that I want to do here.
[27:25.20]I gotta go out west.
[27:25.96]You have to.
[27:28.07]I can't hire certain people.
[27:29.67]I can't get the space to do certain things.
[27:32.82]People look at you like you have five heads when you tell them, yes, I want to rent out your restaurant for a week.
[27:39.69]Oh, yes, I need a space to film.
[27:41.79]I need a warehouse.
[27:42.99]You won't let me do that.
[27:46.27]I can't.
[27:46.75]It's not here.
[27:47.09]That's all...
[27:49.97]Out there.
[27:51.05]And I'm only pointing this way because I'm pointing the right direction.
[27:54.14]This is east on my view, but I'm going west on your view.
[27:57.98]So... It's all out there.
[28:03.97]And every time I've said, hold on, just wait, wait, wait, hold on, just wait, wait, wait.
[28:06.49]That's because me and my friend who does a lot of the producing stuff with him, he helps me a lot.
[28:12.61]Back and forth with emails.
[28:13.77]Yeah, I'll be forwarding to this person.
[28:15.69]Yeah, actually, you know, maybe you'll do that.
[28:17.39]Let me let me like get you to this guy.
[28:18.88]I have no idea what the fuck you want.
[28:20.64]Hey, what do you guys want to do?
[28:22.72]Can I call you back in like a week?
[28:24.48]It's just a standstill out here for anything to do with entertainment or anything in that industry.
[28:30.84]It sucks.
[28:37.57]So that's one of the number one reasons why I want to move and why I'm going.
[28:45.80]Rent out a circus.
[28:49.84]I can't rent out a whole circus.
[28:53.00]Plus the internet.
[28:54.50]Plus there's more to do out there.
[28:56.28]It's just out there, everything.
[29:01.08]My phone camera is good.
[29:02.40]I can help you for free.
[29:06.38]I appreciate that.
[29:07.14]Thank you.
[29:10.42]But, no.
[29:11.42]That is, uh... That's the plan.
[29:15.23]I do feel bad about the main channel.
[29:18.55]But the main channel just sort of teleported here.
[29:20.77]That's all.
[29:21.25]That's it.
[29:23.07]It was just recombobulated into Twitch.
[29:26.83]I'm still the same guy.
[29:27.93]Have I changed?
[29:28.75]Have I changed?
[29:29.85]Tell me that.
[29:30.81]Tell me that.
[29:31.23]Have I changed?
[29:32.91]Hmm?
[29:35.28]Huh?
[29:38.44]How?
[29:39.16]How have I changed?
[29:40.54]What have I done?
[29:43.11]I'm a vegan now.
[29:46.05]That's not true, though.
[29:47.39]You're making that up.
[29:56.92]No more funny voices?
[30:00.35]I got balder.
[30:03.74]My physical appearance has nothing to do with how I treat online stuff.
[30:10.24]You know what I'm saying?
[30:11.62]Get the guitar up.
[30:19.61]Greasy hair.
[30:20.27]No, I was at the gym.
[30:21.39]I did a sit-up.
[30:29.25]Uh, what?
[30:34.06]I did one sit-up.
[30:35.48]I did one sit-up and I fucking threw up on the apex.
[30:39.56]My stomach was all screwed up.
[30:40.81]I was lying there.
[30:42.21]My personal trainer, $5,500 an hour.
[30:44.01]He's one of the best in the world.
[30:46.05]He's like, alright, man.
[30:47.91]Bro, when you get up here, I want you to scream, hell yeah, right in my face.
[30:52.40]And I'm sitting there like, okay, hell yeah.
[30:53.98]This guy's really motivating me.
[30:55.97]And he's like, ready, man, one, two, three, on three.
[30:58.30]And I'm like, okay, just count for me.
[30:59.94]And he goes, one, two, three.
[31:02.64]And I threw up right into his mouth.
[31:05.26]And he was in the middle, he was like about to take a sip out of his drink.
[31:08.26]So he was holding my two feet.
[31:09.62]And I came up and threw up directly as he was like, and he like, and he threw up.
[31:17.73]He puked immediately directly into my mouth.
[31:19.83]I started to sneeze.
[31:20.75]So I went, and it went into my mouth and I swallowed that.
[31:26.53]And then I sneezed out all of his throw up at the same time.
[31:29.22]And then a lady that was over here that was just doing squats looked over and she fucking puked.
[31:35.26]And she puked.
[31:35.82]She was doing squats.
[31:37.60]And for some reason, she was being the support.
[31:40.08]She was actually holding a bar for some guy.
[31:43.20]So she was doing the, you know, oh, hold on.
[31:45.20]I'm here for you.
[31:45.94]She did a squat and go like this.
[31:47.57]So she threw up directly into this guy's face.
[31:49.69]And that guy shit his pants.
[31:51.31]And then shit got all over the equipment.
[31:53.33]Alright, I'm done with that one.
[31:57.35]I hate this.
[32:00.79]That's a nice Family Guy bit.
[32:04.23]Here's the difference though.
[32:05.91]My version ends right there.
[32:08.48]It doesn't go on for like another 15 minutes.
[32:13.38]If that was a true Family Guy bit, that would have gone on like across the whole rest of the gym.
[32:23.94]That's the scariest story that you've told.
[32:25.66]I didn't tell any stories today.
[32:26.74]I wasn't here.
[32:30.67]It's just the aristocrats.
[32:34.23]Is this the right coffee?
[32:38.41]What?
[32:40.95]Was this here?
[32:41.56]Why do they have the same amount of liquid?
[32:46.02]The same amount.
[32:46.88]One of them is just a little bigger.
[32:47.78]This one has ice in it though, so this is the real one.
[32:54.26]Yeah, that's real.
[32:56.02]Real bad.
[32:59.87]Hey, you guys want something funny?
[33:05.88]It doesn't even work.
[33:06.46]Never mind.
[33:11.98]Memory loss?
[33:12.70]How do I have memory loss?
[33:18.76]What a 10 out of 10 stream.
[33:20.30]I told you guys.
[33:21.10]I told you I wasn't prepared for this one.
[33:26.19]Duncan is the shit.
[33:26.99]Duncan is passable.
[33:32.91]Lego Island?
[33:33.57]I haven't forgotten about Lego Island.
[33:39.05]Just play a game.
[33:42.54]No, I'm too paranoid about upstairs.
[33:48.06]I can't just get involved into something right now.
[33:53.58]Oblivion's on sale?
[33:54.60]I played Skyrim.
[33:55.48]Do I need to play Oblivion if I played Skyrim?
[34:00.24]What's upstairs?
[34:02.53]For those of you that just got in here.
[34:05.69]Play Oblivion?
[34:06.91]I don't want to play Oblivion right now.
[34:08.61]I don't have like five hours.
[34:13.78]Foolish question.
[34:14.88]Is Oblivion better than Skyrim?
[34:17.34]I didn't even play Skyrim though.
[34:19.70]I like hacked it.
[34:22.58]I downloaded a bunch of mods and didn't play 15 seconds of the actual game.
[34:27.61]I've never played it.
[34:28.95]Is it good?
[34:29.37]Is Skyrim a good game?
[34:35.55]Oblivion is better.
[34:37.73]Should I actually be real?
[34:39.75]Don't joke with me here.
[34:41.11]Don't meme me on this one.
[34:44.61]Do you actually want to see me play Oblivion?
[34:55.38]I saw one person or two people said no.
[34:58.92]Another person said no.
[34:59.83]That's three, four, five, six, seven.
[35:05.03]Eight, nine people said no.
[35:09.23]We get to 10 no's.
[35:10.31]We got to 10 no's.
[35:11.07]I'm sorry, guys.
[35:14.13]That's like 0.1% of the audience that has responded so far.
[35:17.41]I have to take that into consideration.
[35:24.16]Straw poll.
[35:25.36]I'll play it.
[35:26.50]I'll play it.
[35:26.92]I'm not right this second, though.
[35:29.68]But people are asking, what are you talking about?
[35:30.92]Why are you paranoid?
[35:31.60]Why do you have to go upstairs?
[35:34.32]I was going to say this.
[35:35.20]I'm going to just close my eyes here.
[35:37.62]Sorry.
[35:37.90]I'm going to close my eyes.
[35:39.16]I'm going to say it.
[35:40.86]Very, very slowly.
[35:41.60]I'm just going to say it one more time.
[35:43.13]Okay, here we go.
[35:45.15]There's a hornet's nest in my wall that they've taken over a part of the kitchen inside of the siding of my house.
[35:55.44]And every hour, one or two of them find their way inside of the house.
[36:02.53]And they're all going into the bedroom for some reason.
[36:04.71]So I have to sleep on the couch.
[36:09.45]But because it is later on, they go dormant at night.
[36:13.41]So they're not doing it now.
[36:14.93]At least I'd say that.
[36:15.91]I say this shit and then I'm going to walk upstairs.
[36:18.75]I'm going to go like this upstairs.
[36:21.95]And I'm going to hear the sounds.
[36:24.89]And I've been going crazy, guys.
[36:26.93]I've been losing my mind.
[36:28.35]I hear them.
[36:30.74]Even if they don't exist.
[36:32.88]When you hear that sound, enough times, I'm in the shower and I'm sitting there washing my fucking face and I hear it and I turn the water off and I'm like, what the fuck is he?
[36:45.51]Where is he?
[36:45.91]And I just sit quiet, silent, waiting to hear it again and I don't hear it.
[36:54.07]No, that's the air conditioner.
[36:56.51]Do you see what I'm talking about?
[36:57.97]Did anybody hear that?
[37:01.43]You did, right?
[37:07.03]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[37:11.75]Dementia.
[37:18.99]You're making the video?
[37:21.36]Watch some videos?
[37:22.94]Maybe we'll watch like... Should we do that thing where I watch videos on my channel?
[37:30.14]This is like not even... I...
[37:35.48]yeah yeah yeah this is like I don't like doing like this but I'll make an exception what are we watching should we watch the Red Dead Redemption 2 gameplay trailer whoa are you for real reaction you want to see a reaction video those are real popular aren't they where I go like this
[38:06.43]Did they bring back the lasso?
[38:17.39]Yeah.
[38:20.19]No, that was in the first one.
[38:27.38]Never in a million years did I ever think that watching somebody watch TV
[38:35.92]was gonna be a thing that people wanted to watch.
[38:39.86]I understand people wanting to watch somebody play a game or walk around somewhere or put on a broadcast or do some kind of competition, but watching somebody else watch TV, I don't know about that.
[38:55.39]I mean, why don't they just watch the TV, right?
[39:06.17]Like you got a guy in the corner who you have to pay attention to.
[39:11.05]And you imagine if you were in a, we're going to do this right now.
[39:15.17]I want you to, this is a real scenario, play it out in your head and watch it on the screen.
[39:19.64]Let me just give me a minute so I can figure it out.
[39:22.46]So I need to take a screenshot of this.
[39:27.20]So you're in your living room watching Star Trek.
[39:29.90]I don't care what you're watching.
[39:32.42]Let's go.
[39:33.04]Let's print screen this.
[39:37.90]OK.
[39:41.89]Give me one second.
[39:50.16]Paste that.
[39:52.40]No, you dummy.
[39:55.60]OK.
[40:02.47]This works.
[40:06.38]Let's crop this and then just save it.
[40:15.31]Desktop.
[40:15.83]That's fine.
[40:16.59]Okay.
[40:18.19]So why do you think... Why do you think that?
[40:22.19]I'm pointing at you.
[40:23.27]It's you.
[40:23.67]It's not you.
[40:24.61]It might be some of you guys.
[40:25.75]I don't know.
[40:27.33]Take this with a grain of salt.
[40:28.25]I'm about to make fun of you.
[40:30.03]But I'm not making fun of you.
[40:31.61]Don't think it like that.
[40:32.69]I'm just observationing a few things.
[40:36.41]I'm not making fun of anybody.
[40:38.07]Except, I mean, I'm poking fun of the situation.
[40:41.40]There you go.
[40:43.12]I'm not making fun of anybody.
[40:46.58]Okay, here we go.
[40:54.10]So, if you were in your living room, and over here is a TV, right?
[40:59.03]I need a TV here.
[41:03.39]Let's just flip this.
[41:07.82]okay so I'm in my living room watching TV and I got my friend over this is my buddy this is my buddy dan right TV's right there and I'm watching Star Trek you don't you're not you wouldn't be freaked out if dan was just staring at you like this if dan was just looking at you while you were watching Star Trek I'm just sitting there enjoying the show
[41:37.39]He's not looking at me.
[41:41.22]How do I get him to look at me?
[41:43.54]No, I have to do it again.
[41:44.74]Where am I?
[41:45.14]This way?
[41:45.94]Here we go.
[41:46.34]I'll do it.
[41:47.26]No, you want to make it even weirder?
[41:49.12]I'll make it even weirder for you.
[41:50.62]Watch this.
[41:57.85]Okay.
[41:58.73]Because guess what?
[41:59.21]It's not just one guy.
[42:00.09]It's not just Dan that's just fucking sitting there looking at you.
[42:02.87]It's like 700 people are over your house.
[42:06.42]And all of them are watching you while you watch Star Trek.
[42:13.24]What?
[42:15.29]Where?
[42:15.73]Alright, let's paste.
[42:23.01]That's better.
[42:30.56]There we go.
[42:31.22]Dan can just be stuck in his own world there.
[42:33.36]It doesn't matter.
[42:34.70]I'm just trying to make my point.
[42:37.33]I'm just trying to make a point right okay crop that phase two I'll just copy these a few times okay like I'm just in the middle here just trying to watch TV
[43:08.06]at what point do we start to get into the how uh way too far into the weeds here what happens when so I'm watching Star Trek what happens when dan is watching Mike watch me watch Star Trek while he makes a rubik's cube that like what if we're going already this far
[43:37.27]So he's watching me watch Star Trek while he is also watching me watch Star Trek while he makes a Rubik's Cube.
[43:45.27]And then he... No, he... They're all watching.
[43:49.28]It don't matter.
[43:49.70]They're all watching.
[43:53.22]Who watches the Watchers?
[43:54.46]But that's what happens now.
[43:57.50]I'm already watching and someone's watching me watching.
[44:00.01]So why wouldn't somebody watch the Watcher watching me?
[44:06.77]Alright, get this shit, get out of here.
[44:08.97]Get out of here, image three.
[44:15.92]Yeah, and it's not just, like I said, it's not just two people.
[44:17.98]There are 3,300 people here.
[44:20.34]If I put on like SpongeBob and I put myself in the corner, what am I adding to SpongeBob?
[44:32.67]I'm actually taking away from SpongeBob.
[44:35.49]I don't want to be here for that.
[44:36.85]I want you to experience that quadrant of the screen over here.
[44:40.94]What if Patrick fell down over here?
[44:42.74]You would just see my bored-ass face.
[44:45.62]Alright, let's watch a video.
[44:52.77]What do you say?
[44:57.30]You want to get some developer commentary on some of my shitty videos?

[45:04.41]Wow, that was weird.
[45:10.56]Okay, when I just did that, this side of my whole face just hurt.
[45:15.08]Huh.
[45:22.34]I think we're fine.
[45:23.74]That was a little weird.
[45:26.00]Anyways, getting old.

[54:20.42]No, here comes another, I can't believe this is what we're doing.
[54:27.65]No, no, this is a meme funeral.
[54:29.07]That's not, that's not, we're not doing that.
[54:41.32]The United Union gnome.
[54:42.40]That's funny.
[54:43.38]That's funny when you give me the gnome link.
[54:45.48]I love it.
[54:50.84]Is this another one?
[54:58.71]No, we already had this one.
[54:59.57]We already did this one.
[55:01.33]Alright, alright.
[55:01.95]Let's watch an actual video that I made.
[55:08.85]So, what do you guys want to watch?
[55:19.85]No, that's the 900, 800, 500 one.
[55:22.97]Where picture from four years ago in San Francisco, where San Francisco is the entire city is owned.
[55:32.89]It's almost an 80 degree angle in San Francisco.
[55:36.21]Standing next to Shibby 2142, who is enormous.
[55:40.10]He's like six fucking four.
[55:42.93]So he's standing here.
[55:44.73]The hill in San Francisco is like this, right?
[55:48.11]Like that.
[55:49.31]He's standing here and I'm standing here.
[55:53.40]You guys can't give me that kind of shit without the data to back it up.
[56:03.50]Alright, let's watch... What's like a good video I've ever made?
[56:10.46]The planets are now aligned, I have to watch Rat Movie.
[56:16.01]Okay.
[56:23.82]Fine.
[56:24.24]Okay, fine.
[56:24.90]We will watch Rat Movie 1 on stream.
[56:34.36]Let's do it.
[56:39.98]This video has a fucking million views.
[56:44.05]I did not even know that.
[56:47.30]Wow.
[56:48.01]That's actually kind of insane.
[56:51.91]Alright, let's watch it.
[56:53.17]It's only five minutes.
[56:55.09]I thought this was like 30 seconds.
[56:58.67]Alright, let's watch it and I'll do the react thing where I go, oh wow, remember that one?
[57:05.74]There you go.
[57:07.14]Here it comes.
[57:10.70]Paste.
[57:13.06]Wow.
[57:14.56]No, no, no.
[57:17.22]No, interact.
[57:18.68]Stop it.
[57:19.46]Skip ad.
[57:21.50]Okay.
[57:24.06]So I gotta react to this.
[57:28.40]I gotta tell you what I was thinking.
[57:37.57]Let's just totally react, you know what I mean?
[57:41.51]Where can I go?
[57:42.05]This is what I'm talking about.
[57:43.11]You need the whole screen.
[57:47.90]Alright, so let's watch it.
[57:52.14]Here we go.
[57:52.76]We're going to get the true commentary.
[57:58.32]Rats.
[57:59.24]We're rats.
[58:00.66]We're the rats.
[58:02.89]We pray at night.
[58:04.01]We stalk at night.
[58:05.47]We're the rats.
[58:08.05]I'm the giant rat that makes all of the rules.
[58:12.51]Let's see what kind of trouble we can get ourselves into.
[58:18.59]So sue me for being thorough.
[58:20.33]I want to know that you know what the plan is.
[58:22.71]Look, seriously, mate.
[58:24.49]How many artifacts do we need to steal before you trust me with these jobs?
[58:28.24]Well, I just want to make sure you know what's happening.
[58:30.42]We're going to get the treasure.
[58:31.66]We're going to get out of there.
[58:33.14]And we also have to... And we must get it.
[58:37.39]That's the most important thing.
[58:38.71]So be on your A game.
[58:39.87]We go now.
[58:42.38]I get to drive the car today because it's my birthday.
[58:44.84]No, don't let him get in the car.
[58:46.28]It's a rat right there.
[58:48.56]He's driving, whatever.
[58:49.81]Oi, more importantly.
[58:52.45]The rat's gonna kill this guy or what?
[58:54.87]Get in.
[58:56.99]Let's go.
[58:57.41]Speed it up.
[58:58.77]Yeah, that's the speed I'm looking for.
[59:00.95]That's the type of fastness I want.
[59:02.51]I don't even know where you're going at this point.
[59:06.83]We've been driving all night.
[59:08.58]My birthday you you just you're running over a guy right now.
[59:13.86]Are you fucking serious?
[59:18.44]Remember me next time we do this.
[59:19.92]I'll get my nan to drive.
[59:25.63]I Don't know what to say like $10 to dance
[59:33.30]I made this.
[59:33.60]That's what I can say.
[59:34.52]I gotta react.
[59:34.90]Alright, fine.
[59:35.46]I can't react.
[59:36.05]You don't think I know my own material?
[60:00.91]He knows it.
[60:01.77]He knows it.
[60:03.37]Is it in there?
[60:04.32]Yep.
[60:05.00]It's all here.
[60:07.06]Fun story.
[60:09.16]And now we are invincible.
[60:11.34]Hold on a second here.
[60:13.14]Funny thing about this part of the show.
[60:18.75]3D Movie Maker had an expansion that came out that was the Nickelodeon pack.
[60:25.25]And
[60:27.01]You couldn't get away with it anymore now.
[60:29.37]But you could... I don't think I ever used them.
[60:31.35]But Ren and Stimpy.
[60:33.25]All the Aureal monsters.
[60:34.69]I think the Rugrats.
[60:37.35]All those characters where you could use them.
[60:39.93]And do all this shit with them.
[60:42.42]And I was going to make a fake cartoon with it.
[60:48.14]And then I realized I would actually get probably in trouble for that.
[60:52.98]If I used real Ren and Stimpy assets...
[60:58.02]I probably could have gotten, like, the video taken down.
[61:09.04]That's it!
[61:09.48]Not so fast!
[61:11.72]You stand before Gerard, guardian of the treasure chest of the Mayan temple, and I will make sure... He was going to be in Jerm Rumble Live, but I couldn't find a suit of armor that made it funny enough.
[61:22.51]What are you doing?
[61:27.30]night we stopped that night I couldn't get a suit of armor they were like 700 bucks yeah that's cool yeah I like rats nothing bad with rats but let me tell you something over my dead body are you getting this treasure that's your favorite movie too right
[61:50.24]Yo, my favorite movie is Frozen.
[61:52.00]I like Elsa and Anna.
[61:53.40]Okay, now I kill you.
[61:54.62]Funny story about this.
[61:56.32]Their actual favorite movie is not Frozen.
[61:59.15]What happened was on the set, the director said, hey, I really want to get some ice cream.
[62:05.23]Can I get some frozen yogurt?
[62:06.75]And the actor heard Frozen, and he was originally going to say Aladdin.
[62:11.82]He was going to say Aladdin.
[62:13.14]Funny, interesting little tidbit there.
[62:19.54]Wow, that's great pick choice for favorite is movie.
[62:23.07]I wonder if I have to think that now.
[62:25.73]Now I get to be the giant rat.
[62:27.39]Cool surprise.
[62:29.79]That joke wasn't funny.
[62:30.69]I hated that part.
[62:31.43]I wanted to remove that.
[62:32.29]That whole exchange here.
[62:33.47]I hate this.
[62:34.56]That was alright.
[62:35.40]The pickles thing, I didn't like.
[62:36.66]This is my favorite part coming up here.
[62:54.84]Hello, sir.
[62:55.90]Welcome to the rat cafe.
[62:57.42]There's no rats here.
[62:58.94]It's just hamburgers.
[63:00.99]That would be real nice if that were true.
[63:03.71]Except it isn't.
[63:05.15]You're a rat, aren't you?
[63:08.09]No, no.
[63:08.53]Why would that happen?
[63:09.45]That's not us.
[63:10.23]We're just rats.
[63:11.13]We're just people.
[63:13.13]Wouldn't it be funny if this were real?
[63:16.47]I'm just kidding.
[63:17.60]Be careful, though.
[63:18.30]There's apparently a giant rat around.
[63:19.84]I don't like that one either.
[63:20.58]You have a good day, officer.
[63:22.02]I don't like that part of there.
[63:22.96]I snipped that part out.
[63:25.17]That was good.
[63:25.85]I'll take that one.
[63:26.45]The rest of the video, I was shit-faced, so I forgot everything I made.
[63:30.94]This is like embarrassing.
[63:54.12]never never eat your own brand as they say you your duty will not go unnoticed what's that on you
[64:02.22]Are you wearing a rat on your shoulder?
[64:04.06]I like this part.
[64:05.26]Are you kidding me right now, cat police?
[64:09.08]Get us the fuck out of here.
[64:10.52]This took so long to animate.
[64:26.36]It was like, at least four and a half hours or six hours or something, which... It's like, when I say that, here's how, um, how deluded I am, right?
[64:44.83]Oh man, that scene took like six hours to animate.
[64:47.66]You know how long that would take if that was actually like a talented artist putting that together?
[64:53.96]And actually drawing all that out?
[64:56.98]It would be like six months.
[65:00.33]It would be like at least like a month for like a fully frame-by-frame drawn animated sequence.
[65:08.07]And I'm like, man, that took like six hours.
[65:10.39]Woo!
[65:10.67]Woo-hoo!
[65:19.62]But, yeah.
[65:20.50]So you want me to explain the ending?
[65:21.54]Okay, I'll explain the ending to Rat Movie 1.
[65:27.90]The ending to Rat Movie 1 is very, very, very easy to explain.
[65:33.39]It's called Two Weeks Had Gone By and I was still adding dumb shit to this video and it turned out I hadn't had a video uploaded for like, I needed to cap it and I had to upload it.
[65:48.66]So I had already spent way too much time on it, so I just needed to end it.
[65:57.81]That's pretty much it.
[66:01.37]And although it's aliens, right?
[66:02.68]I had to go to bed.
[66:06.10]I actually specifically remember being very agitated right here.
[66:10.98]because it was so close to being done.
[66:12.78]The program crashes, by the way.
[66:14.30]3D Movie Maker, it functions in a square this big on the screen.
[66:23.41]Let's say you're on your desktop.
[66:26.43]3D Movie Maker can only be used on a 1920 by 1080 screen this big in the middle of the screen.
[66:34.99]So it's so hard to do anything because if you full screen it, if you try to pull it out, it's not going to happen.
[66:41.28]The whole thing breaks.
[66:43.28]It was not designed to be on a computer older than 1995.
[66:46.54]It's like a 240p program.
[66:51.65]Not even like 360p.
[66:54.63]So at this point here, I was just so done.
[66:58.09]I was just so over it.
[66:59.09]I just ended and get it up.
[67:02.11]I didn't think people were going to like this.
[67:03.37]I was actually shocked that people liked it as much as they did.
[67:07.46]This was just kind of me dicking around with a program that I used to use.
[67:10.86]Me and friends of us, we would use this program.
[67:12.64]We'd make so many fucked up movies with this thing.
[67:16.42]There are probably a hundred 3D movie maker movies that me and my old childhood friends have made that were way more detailed than this.
[67:28.23]We would spend weeks on, months on 3D.
[67:31.45]I thought there was a bug over there.
[67:34.09]We'd spend months on this shit.
[67:37.29]Release them.
[67:38.77]Yeah, let me go dig out a computer that was buried in a landfill 17 years ago, and maybe I'll find it.
[67:54.21]Alright, so we got a new wasp video.
[67:55.87]Alright, let's get this up there.
[68:05.88]I got another wasp video right here.
[68:23.14]So I think the thing about, I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[68:28.30]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[68:32.74]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[68:36.07]Okay, he landed.
[68:47.95]What?
[68:49.45]What the fuck?
[68:52.07]That was very well done, though.
[68:54.15]That little transition right here.
[68:55.55]Right there.
[69:12.91]Did I kill the bee and then the Millennium Falcon took out my ship?
[69:18.07]Is that what we're led to believe?
[69:19.01]Nice.
[69:26.61]I like it.
[69:30.51]The bee expanded.
[69:31.47]Alright, let's see what else we got here.
[69:39.60]Is this another one?
[69:42.84]Yeah, we got another one.
[69:43.54]This is fucking... I love this.
[69:56.17]Let's change this to this.
[70:05.13]So I think the thing about...
[70:08.22]I think going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[70:10.28]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[70:14.72]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[70:15.82]Okay, he landed.
[70:22.02]Woo, up in smoke.
[70:28.81]That one had some animation here for the hands.
[70:40.26]God.
[70:44.35]Hot.
[70:45.83]Firebender.
[70:49.01]Where's the original clip?
[70:51.19]I don't know.
[70:51.65]At this point, I have no idea.
[70:54.37]Just tuned in.
[70:55.01]What is all this?
[70:57.38]I can't even explain it.
[70:58.50]Could you guys explain what the fuck we're doing right now?
[71:01.00]I couldn't if I tried.
[71:01.98]I was talking about the hornets that are in my wall and then... Alright, what's this one?
[71:10.29]Here comes another one.
[71:12.19]This one's long.
[71:12.89]Have they all been this long?
[71:21.73]What the fuck?
[71:22.43]Hold on.
[71:27.37]No, that's the wrong one.
[71:30.55]It's this one.
[71:36.84]Let's get that one up there.
[71:48.37]I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[71:50.46]No, let's replay it.
[71:51.38]So I think the thing about, I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[71:56.62]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, wait, hold on.

[73:34.97]What the fuck?

[78:01.45]I'm writing, of course, from the old county jail.
[78:05.32]Those fuckers got me, as you can plainly see.
[78:09.42]What do I do now besides take a pee?
[78:13.71]Arrested for much I'm about to explain.
[78:16.61]Sit back and relax while my words entertain.
[78:21.60]Our story unfolds on a cold Christmas Eve.
[78:25.26]A two pairs of socks night, if you could believe.
[78:29.04]The TV was loud and just how I like it.
[78:31.92]Fotted 30 times.
[78:33.54]Trust me, I counted.
[78:35.41]What a glorious night.
[78:36.91]Not a care in the world.
[78:38.63]Nothing could ruin this, all of this, uh, this great... I'm having a really good time.
[78:45.59]Really, I can't think of what rhymes with world for this current situation.
[78:49.72]So it was just fun.
[78:51.45]Sipping my tea and eating my crackers, an annoying voice came up through the window.
[78:56.44]Here comes me!
[78:56.94]Here I come!
[78:57.72]It's Christmas Eve, Grandpa.
[78:59.34]This is not good.
[79:00.72]There are no gifts from you underneath that hood.
[79:03.56]Of that beautiful tree that we spent so much time making, I'm not messing around, and I am not faking.
[79:09.12]Get your ass out of that chair and into the snow, or Christmas is ruined.
[79:13.37]Hurry up and go.
[79:15.51]Jerma sucks.
[79:16.75]That's all that needs to be said.
[79:18.17]I really wish he would permanently go to bed.
[79:21.73]Standing up from my wonderful man station.
[79:24.65]God damn it, my procrastination.
[79:27.75]Stores were all closed.
[79:29.23]Nothing was open.
[79:30.45]This newfound bad news, I was having trouble coping.
[79:33.77]I had to think fast.
[79:35.03]There was just no more time.
[79:36.81]I was all out of options.
[79:38.93]So it came to a crime.
[79:42.70]The night came quick, and I acted with swiftness.
[79:45.90]For there's only so much you can steal on Christmas.
[79:48.58]Like the Grinch!
[79:49.30]Out through the door, there was no looking back.
[79:51.96]It was time to rip off a neighborhood ass crack.
[79:55.24]What?
[79:55.60]Down the street, I trotted on my imaginary horse.
[79:59.22]The hallucinatic drugs I took were running their course.
[80:02.40]Threw my body in blood and made things all hazy.
[80:05.64]This house looks good, but was I going crazy?
[80:09.32]There was nobody home, not a light in the house.
[80:12.02]I got off my steed and creeped close like a mouse.
[80:15.62]Dressed all in black from my head to my toe, I smashed through the front window with a perfect brick throw.
[80:22.04]Climbing through the clearing, I slitted like a snake.
[80:24.90]No one's home, though.
[80:26.36]I could have been a fucking earthquake.
[80:28.51]Once inside, I went right for the jewelry, because that's the most expensive.
[80:32.59]There is no tomfoolery.
[80:34.77]on my way out I left an iou if I ever would pay it not sure that would be true into the brisk wind from which I first came a cruiser was waiting they were ready to tame this old man can still run I shouted and screamed a sharp pain I felt shooting into my spleen I was feeling the wrath of over 5 000 volts my body struck down like a lightning bolt
[80:59.92]A taser?
[81:00.98]Really?
[81:01.34]I'm an old man, for Christ's sake.
[81:03.66]Every single inch of my body did ache.
[81:06.77]Into the back of the cruiser we rolled through the night.
[81:10.11]I heard them joke and giggle about my pathetic attempts to fight.
[81:14.29]I don't blame them, though.
[81:15.69]It was really dumb.
[81:17.20]Would I take it all back?
[81:18.56]Was I feeling numb?
[81:19.80]Do I plead insanity, shit myself in the back seat, punch myself in the face and blame it on Wall Street?
[81:26.09]There's a message there.
[81:27.43]Wow.
[81:27.69]Wow.
[81:55.58]Look at this old outro screen.

[82:40.64]No, I didn't even care.
[82:41.66]I just really didn't.
[82:43.60]By the way, this is just ice that's melting into the cup.

[87:13.64]Griffinsteed, Griffinsteed.
[87:14.78]You want to watch Castle Griffinsteed?
[87:19.07]Before we watch Castle Griffinsteed, I'll tell you about Castle Griffinsteed 2 that never got made.
[87:24.47]Actually, it started to get made.
[87:27.53]Once that Castle Griffinsteed 1 got on the front page of Reddit, I was like in overdrive mode.
[87:33.38]I was like, I gotta make another one.
[87:35.84]I gotta make another one right now.
[87:37.14]I gotta do it.
[87:37.68]Come on, come on, come on.
[87:38.66]Let's go, go, go.
[87:39.22]Get it.
[87:39.68]What am I doing?
[87:40.12]What am I doing?
[87:42.04]I freaked out.
[87:45.06]One was going to come out not even a month later.
[87:49.00]But I did too much work.
[87:53.01]I got caught up with too many other things.
[87:54.87]And I didn't do it.
[87:55.97]But the things that I did finish was the second one starts... Well, let's watch the first one.
[88:01.79]And then we'll talk about the second one.
[88:03.61]I finished like 9% of the second one.
[88:11.08]It was on the front page of all, of slash all.
[88:16.52]That's probably the most attention any video of mine has ever received.
[88:24.64]I'm just being like, holy shit.
[88:26.90]That was a shocker.
[88:36.11]That was my first Jerma video.
[88:38.69]Well, that's one of my favorite videos ever, so, that I've made.
[88:41.62]Oh, he's a Reddit celeb.
[88:45.42]A clip of my super hot gameplay was in a Markiplier video?
[88:58.57]I kind of, um...
[89:00.97]People tell me that, oh, hey, you know, so-and-so said this, or so-and-so, you were in this video.
[89:05.07]Somebody talked to the other.
[89:06.79]At this point, I'm just kind of like, that's alright.
[89:10.11]Yeah, I guess.
[89:12.19]That's cool.
[89:14.11]I don't know, like, the context about half of these things, right?
[89:17.97]But that's it.
[89:20.63]It's very interesting that somebody would want to watch something of mine that has way more in the clout department than I would ever have.
[89:28.76]So that's cool.
[89:33.02]Mr. Sark recommended me on Twitter once.
[89:36.76]Yeah, I talked to Sark.
[89:38.18]Me and Sark talk.
[89:39.56]Hey, me and Sark talk, you know, guys.
[89:44.66]I have his phone number.
[89:45.80]Why don't we call him?
[89:47.95]Oh, nice clout you got there.
[89:49.89]Hey, you got a little bit of clout there.
[89:54.17]You look at this humble brat.
[89:55.53]Well, you know, I was on the front page of Reddit one time.
[89:58.45]Remember when I did that one time I was on the front page of Reddit?
[90:01.75]I do.
[90:05.13]You know what I'm saying?
[90:06.18]Front page.
[90:12.94]I'm stuck.

[90:24.59]I'll go get him.
[90:25.91]We'll do another hour of fucking scary stories.
[90:27.97]I'll go hire him again.
[90:32.39]Castle Griffin, Steve.
[90:33.13]Let's pull it up.
[90:40.65]Wait, why are there two of these?
[90:46.66]Why does this one say... What?
[90:51.46]Oh, this is on a website.
[90:52.62]This is PG-13.
[90:58.46]What fucking website did this get put on?
[91:00.54]I have no idea.
[91:01.18]Alright, well, here we go.
[91:04.16]He's humble, bro.
[91:05.28]Hey, I got put on a website with this video?
[91:08.27]Huh?
[91:11.31]Got all that web, look at that.
[91:12.47]That's at least a quarter of an inch.
[91:16.39]You know, hey, you know what I'm saying?
[91:18.55]You gotta watch out for that one.
[91:29.80]He's got clout.
[91:30.52]Yeah, this is what they call a clout fist.
[91:33.41]You know what I'm saying?
[91:34.45]That's what they call a clout fist.
[91:36.61]It's gonna wind it up just a little and then it comes at you like that.
[91:42.37]And then I completely miss you.
[91:44.09]And then you get me with a jab in my mouth.
[91:45.47]And I go, please stop.
[91:46.27]I don't want to fight you.
[91:46.93]Please don't hurt me.
[91:56.25]Okay, I'm going to put Castle Griffin State.
[91:58.57]Here it is.
[92:05.08]Let's watch it.
[92:06.34]Why not?
[92:21.05]Dammit and I didn't even make this HD.
[92:23.95]No annotate.
[92:24.69]I can't Black Ops 3 opened beta No way, I can't wait August 11.
[92:35.84]Why is it doing this again?
[92:39.04]What Get the fuck out of here Is Castle Griffin Steve
[92:48.72]Hope you enjoy everyone that's already seen this video.
[92:52.22]Today is a very special day.
[92:56.49]Every 25 years, the barbarian village of Elvenwood celebrates what they call the Warrior's Harvest, a fruitful, wonderful celebration of honor where the finest soldier in the village is chosen to venture out far away from camp and potentially to never return.
[93:16.50]I am that man.
[93:18.09]And I will accept the task to find out what happened to my old family's house, Castle Griffinsteed.
[93:25.36]I actually made this, though.
[93:26.70]Long since abandoned and corrupted by dark magic, I must find out what happened.
[93:32.38]I must uncover the secrets of my old family name, for I am Carl Griffinsteed, and my adventure begins.
[93:42.13]I give my final farewells and loom towards the path near the castle.
[93:47.69]There she stands, nearly 200 feet from our encampment.
[93:52.54]I see to my left there could be a broken-down caravan, but I leave it.
[93:57.00]There may be a scary animal inside, and I don't want to deal with that.
[94:01.08]So as I move forward down the path, I think to myself, there's potential for bandits.
[94:06.72]The castle has been seized many times by many different forces.
[94:11.12]And my suspicions are correct.
[94:13.32]Bandits are waiting for me at an outpost.
[94:15.96]We will see who will die today.
[94:18.84]It will not be me.
[94:21.12]I ready my sword and I charge forward.
[94:23.72]Or I wait for them to charge.
[94:25.15]They charge forward and I take my swing with my blade.
[94:27.89]I knock one of them down and their blades have no effect on me because they're just idiots.
[94:33.61]And almost totally unscathed, I walk away from this encounter.
[94:38.27]What war will lie ahead?
[94:39.75]What treachery, what deceit will lie ahead of me in Castle Gryffinstein?
[94:44.89]Where I stand right now, no man has stood.
[94:48.33]Castle Gryffinstein.
[94:48.97]No man enters, no man returns.
[94:51.33]When you step in, you are there forever.
[94:54.05]So I hear from my old grandmother's stories.
[94:57.06]And here we go.
[94:58.94]A castle in ruin.
[95:00.88]Once great, standing tall.
[95:03.70]is now a former fraction of what it used to be.
[95:06.82]Dumpster, yeah.
[95:07.80]But this is not the test.
[95:09.58]The test is the catacombs below.
[95:11.26]That was a checkpoint.
[95:13.36]The test is the catacombs below.
[95:15.97]One can only imagine the secrets and the horrible dungeons that lie ahead of me.
[95:21.57]But I will press on.
[95:23.17]I must find out what happened to my house.
[95:26.23]And I will bring back news to the tribe.
[95:29.46]A dead end.
[95:30.34]A choice.
[95:32.23]One can go left.
[95:33.89]Or one could possibly go right.
[95:35.81]Oh, coins!
[95:36.95]Coins, I need these.
[95:38.92]Cool.
[95:40.35]Does he look at the- like-
[96:03.50]black magic must be performed under here there could be hundreds if not thousands of them doing anything the final one didn't work hopefully I have stopped their ritual I spent hours trying to get those guys to fight me they wouldn't getting sick to my stomach very nervous there's only one way to go and it's straight on through my old family's prisons you can tell it's a prison because look there's bars on the wall through the corridor into the next room
[96:32.54]Where there are coins.
[96:34.40]Alright.
[96:35.56]Okay, well, we got our supplies here, too.
[96:37.36]This is so loud.
[96:38.08]A couple of healing potions.
[96:39.20]I'm just being really loud.
[96:40.32]What's that, an Uzi?
[96:41.66]I'm gonna take the Uzi.
[96:43.24]Magnum.
[96:43.68]I need to be walked over anything.
[96:45.00]And a flail.
[96:46.82]I don't want to use this.
[96:47.66]We're gonna go with the Uzi.
[96:49.82]I think that's the best for this current situation, considering it shoots the most bullets.
[96:54.22]Nothing in there.
[96:55.58]Let's keep going on.
[96:57.02]See what we find upstairs in the dungeon.
[97:00.30]It's the military.
[97:01.60]I should have known.
[97:02.76]The secrets.
[97:03.50]They must want to sell them to some private industrial man.
[97:06.29]Not in my watch.
[97:07.05]Private industrial man.
[97:07.61]You're not going to take me out.
[97:08.37]They're pretty shocking out here.
[97:09.25]Pick up these coins, too.
[97:11.85]It's all about the coins, guys.
[97:13.25]Got to get as many coins as you can, so then people know how high your score is.
[97:16.67]Voice changes.
[97:17.79]What?
[97:18.19]Okay.
[97:19.11]There must be at least one.
[97:20.97]We're going to go with the more finesse weapon.
[97:22.84]Magnum.
[97:24.02]That's not a magnum.
[97:25.18]Yep, I know that.
[97:25.80]I knew it.
[97:26.14]I could see him.
[97:26.78]He was peeking over.
[97:27.56]He thought he was sneaky.
[97:28.42]He's not sneaky.
[97:29.79]I'll show you sneaky.
[97:30.67]That's a one-two.
[97:32.62]One-two.
[97:33.84]That's a rocket.
[97:35.62]Get rid of this guy.
[97:36.16]Don't let him shoot another one.
[97:37.02]I should probably retake this.
[97:41.57]You never know when you're going to need a rocket launcher.
[97:44.15]My old grandmother used to say.
[97:46.71]So, on to the cave system.
[97:50.18]seems to have been dug out rather recently.
[97:51.92]This was so horrible.
[97:52.70]The fresh smell of dirt is... I can't go down the stairs.
[97:55.56]For some reason you can't.
[97:56.52]I may have put these in wrong.
[97:58.08]This whole place was hard to walk through.
[97:59.20]But the mold and mildew kicking the walls and the slight crackling underneath my feet.
[98:04.54]It's one of the lesser demons.
[98:06.76]That is Algorro, the third lieutenant of the underworld.
[98:11.02]I don't stand a warrior's chance.
[98:17.03]That was really easy.
[98:17.95]It was really hard to make that, though.
[98:19.89]That was really easy, but really hard to put them there.
[98:21.85]I think we may have won.
[98:23.27]We may have beaten Castle Griffinsteed.
[98:25.81]I would assume that there's nothing left.
[98:27.43]That must have been the source of all the power.
[98:29.11]Let's make our exit.
[98:31.73]Cut.
[98:32.29]Cut to the next scene.
[98:33.02]What the fuck is this?
[98:34.20]Sneaky.
[98:35.18]Sneaky cut.
[98:36.36]This is underneath Castle Griffinsteed.
[98:39.64]A whole land of strange things.
[98:43.12]Creatures and wildlife and vegetation I've never seen before.
[98:47.88]harmless creature it seems but I must keep my wits about me if I'm to uncover the demonic presence I really should make another one of these underneath my old family's house what's in here having lunch I see creepy we're gonna continue on another place another building time what is in this one
[99:10.71]Oh, a shop.
[99:11.49]Oh, cool.
[99:12.11]I told you guys I was going to need those coins.
[99:14.25]Okay, so we're going to get... I'll take some potions from you, good sir.
[99:18.69]Your radar gun.
[99:19.59]I'm going to switch to the shotgun.
[99:23.55]Okay, it's time to go.
[99:25.25]I'm going to go now.
[99:26.30]I don't really want to be here anymore.
[99:28.28]You guys are seriously creeping me out.
[99:30.44]We're going to leave.
[99:31.74]One more door to check, just for good measure.
[99:33.90]We're going to open it up.
[99:39.07]Get away from me!
[99:40.17]Get away from me, you vile creatures!
[99:41.89]You're not going to catch me!
[99:44.14]Get me out of here!
[99:45.00]I don't even want to be here anymore!
[99:47.52]Laser beams!
[99:48.72]How dare you shoot me!
[99:50.06]I gotta go.
[99:50.76]Time to run.
[99:51.60]It's time to get out of here.
[99:56.52]Another dungeon.
[99:57.90]It never ends.
[99:59.60]What else could I find under here?
[100:02.07]I thought I killed with demonic presence.
[100:04.13]But of course not.
[100:04.77]It's a zombie game now.
[100:05.75]Don't you know every game has to have zombies in 2015?
[100:09.59]What the hell is going on there?
[100:11.83]Alright.
[100:12.99]I can't be much further away from the final secret.
[100:15.61]I wonder...
[100:17.29]What is that?
[100:17.77]I just saw a hand.
[100:19.65]That must be Algulu, the giant demon, stuck in the wall for all eternity.
[100:23.91]I've only heard stories about this.
[100:26.35]Hey, remember when I told you that little story about how I had to finish it because it was just... I needed a video I hadn't uploaded in like a week and a half, and I had to fucking finish the damn thing?
[100:44.11]Here you go.
[100:45.53]Go.
[100:45.87]I must hide.
[100:47.66]Look at all these creatures.
[100:48.84]What the fuck was that?
[100:50.82]Oh my god, a barrel exploded.
[100:52.22]There's exploding barrels.
[100:53.34]There's bunnies.
[100:54.22]Laser beams everywhere.
[100:55.08]I've got to be careful.
[100:56.92]Aim down sights just like in Call of Duty.
[100:58.99]I remember my grandmother taught me that secret of aim down sights.
[101:02.21]She would be so proud of me if she knew I was using it now.
[101:05.39]Must clear the rest.
[101:06.43]A few more soldiers.
[101:07.21]A few more zombies.
[101:09.11]What's that I hear?
[101:10.51]Oh, no.
[101:11.39]He's getting ready to cast a giant spell.
[101:13.43]I must stop him.
[101:16.88]I must have fucked up his health, because he wasn't supposed to die like that.
[101:20.04]But that's it.
[101:21.32]The zombies are no longer pursuing.
[101:23.74]Have I made it to the final room, the final door?
[101:26.56]Will I uncover the secrets of my family name?
[101:30.12]And what is in here?
[101:32.76]Who is this?
[101:34.94]Welcome, Carl.
[101:36.74]It is I, your great times eighteen great grandfather.
[101:41.70]I can teach you all the secrets, for you are the only person to ever make it through the dungeon.
[101:48.78]So your choice is this.
[101:50.76]Come with me, or take this at least two month's supply of chips.
[101:57.26]The choice is yours.
[101:59.10]I stand you will make the correct one.
[102:01.74]What do you want to know about your father?
[102:04.60]What about your grand- I kind of want the chips.
[102:10.19]Yeah.
[102:11.11]That's a lot of chips.
[102:12.03]That shit was so fucking loud.
[102:18.05]Uh, so, here's the thing about Castle Griffith Street 2.
[102:23.57]One of the things I was going to do at the beginning of Castle Griffinstein 2 was going to take place in the suburbs.
[102:30.41]There's going to be a bunch of houses, right?
[102:32.55]There's going to be a street, a neighborhood, and he was going to be in the house.
[102:37.16]And it starts in the neighborhood.
[102:39.32]He wakes up and he's just, his life is fucking just so...
[102:43.90]There's nothing else for him to do, right?
[102:46.42]There's chips fucking everywhere.
[102:48.00]He's eaten all the chips.
[102:49.53]He's a famous guy.
[102:52.37]He made it.
[102:52.79]He was on the cover of a bunch of magazines, right?
[102:56.13]So, by the way, people that are saying spoilers, this is not happening.
[102:59.95]Like, I canned this two and a half years ago.
[103:04.55]So, how it was going to start was, he goes, he gets invited in his, like, fucking...
[103:11.56]boring life that he has now it's like four or five years after the fact he gets invited to a barbecue at his neighbor's house and he drives a car he got he gets in the car and he drives and fucking crashes into the neighbor's fucking garage a bunch of shit particle effects and stuff and he gets out and he's just bored at the barbecue but he still has that internal monolog
[103:33.09]He's still narrating like his life is really interesting.
[103:36.31]Like I take the ketchup and I put it on the hamburger bun and it slaps.
[103:39.48]It's not like he's still, like he's fucking weird.
[103:43.09]So eventually he goes to sleep, the barbecue is over.
[103:47.76]And that night, a meteor lands and opens up a fucking portal.
[103:54.01]Because, of course, the cheapest cop-out way to do a sequel is just open up a fucking portal.
[103:58.21]Blizzard's done it four times, right?
[104:01.09]Just open up a portal somewhere and you'll be fine.
[104:04.91]So he was going to go to the portal and we were going to go from there and he was going to have to find himself from the first game.
[104:14.36]because apparently the shit he did in the first game I guess made a path to where the meteor was never supposed to hit the Earth because it was part of the secrets it was a whole fucked up story that you know whatever but it was too too much work I just couldn't do it I couldn't sit down and do it all it was going to be longer too this one was 10 minutes it was going to be like 15 minutes
[104:44.29]It sounds good.
[104:46.05]It was getting fun to make, but it's just not, it just, well, let me break it down very, very, very easily.
[104:55.65]Projects like that would take away from everything else I was doing.
[105:01.36]And I had a schedule on my YouTube channel long ago, years ago, right?
[105:05.80]Where I was making a video, I was uploading a video to the channel once every like three or four days.
[105:12.54]So eventually like three, four, five days go by and it's like, I need to have something.
[105:16.99]I want to upload something.
[105:17.93]I just don't want to have something not happen for like three weeks.
[105:21.39]So those videos get to a point where I would start making them and then something else would come out.
[105:27.57]I would want to make a video on that too.
[105:29.61]But on the side, I was doing this for like three or four hours a night.
[105:32.99]And then fuck, I just can't because there's more shit I want to do.
[105:35.55]And I want to upload a video every four or five days.
[105:40.15]So it just kind of gets stuck.
[105:47.23]Unfortunately.
[105:50.51]Oh, we got a B joke?
[105:53.91]I'm all for it.
[105:57.65]I love that people are still making these.
[106:04.70]There are people that are still making the B thing.
[106:06.94]Hold on.
[106:12.70]Alright, let's do it.
[106:15.05]So I think the thing about...
[106:17.41]I think eating, going on a diet, it's not a bad idea.
[106:21.42]Oh shit, hold on, wait, wait, hold on.
[106:24.64]Wait till he lands, wait till he lands.
[106:25.68]Is that Mr. Peanut?
[106:43.42]Mr. Peanut?
[106:44.82]I think eating, going on a diet is not a bad idea.
[106:46.64]Oh, no, that's this dumb... Oh, shit.
[106:48.41]Hold on.
[106:48.69]Wait, wait, wait.
[106:49.01]Hold on.
[106:50.53]There he is.
[106:51.31]Wait till he lands.
[106:51.83]Wait till he lands.
[106:52.67]Okay, he's... You like jazz?
[106:58.67]Ooh, up in smoke.
[107:04.29]Why is Grab That Auto 5 is about to play?
[107:07.46]So I think the thing... I thought it was Mr. Peanut.
[107:15.09]Did they kill that character off or does he still exist?
[107:18.47]Is Mr. Peanut dead in canon?
[107:22.49]Or is he still being a weirdo selling people like shitty peanuts?
[107:28.82]I made one.
[107:29.44]Alright, hold on.
[107:29.78]Let's watch this one.
[107:36.56]Hold on.
[107:38.06]I have to get it on there.
[107:52.33]Hold on here we go So I think the thing about I think eating going on a diet it's not a bad idea Wait till he lands wait till he lands.
[108:08.86]Okay, he landed
[108:19.44]That was so loud.
[108:20.68]See that?

[114:50.18]Nice and crisp.
[114:51.66]Simply take a look around.
[114:53.18]Do you see anything besides pure beauty?
[114:56.84]Would you ever, shall I?
[114:58.34]Oh, no.
[114:59.22]Absolutely not.
[115:00.93]Everything you see here is all for my boy.
[115:08.33]If I could burger bake a refill.
[115:09.63]It blows my mind.
[115:10.47]How does it taste this good?
[115:12.88]Well, you don't learn something unless you teach it, in my opinion.
[115:15.28]I've been working at the same place, Los Santos University Wine Studies, for the past 25 years.
[115:21.66]And counting, let's hope.
[115:25.84]Mom saw those guys outside again.
[115:27.44]It's the third time this week.
[115:29.50]I'll handle it.
[115:30.18]Just stay inside.
[115:31.64]This is my vineyard.
[115:33.88]This is my recipe.
[115:35.96]You're not going to take it.
[115:38.54]You hear me?
[115:41.01]You don't understand.
[115:42.65]It's not just good.
[115:46.31]It's the best.
[115:47.03]It's the best.
[115:50.91]I wish there was more of that wine.
[115:52.77]It's not for sale.
[115:57.57]Generic, like, Marlon Brando guy voice.
[116:22.96]I'm going to need a favor.
[116:24.20]You're trying to do this all by yourself?
[116:25.82]That's crazy talk.
[116:27.08]What do you need?
[116:27.91]I think you know what I'm going to do, Tom.
[116:31.53]They tried to kill my son.
[116:34.01]They torched the very thing that I've put my entire life into.
[116:38.25]Royalty-free music.
[116:39.37]You want this vineyard?
[116:41.64]Come and get it.
[116:42.88]But I warn you, I have a very special set of skills like the guy from Taken.
[116:49.78]I want him dead, and I want his family dead too!
[116:52.72]AK is watching.
[116:54.00]You have no idea who you're dealing with.
[116:57.36]You wanna bring a fight to me?
[116:59.91]Now that was a big mistake.
[117:01.71]I beg to differ.
[117:04.25]They're not gonna stop until they get what they want!
[117:06.51]If I have to go through every single one of them, so be it.
[117:11.83]Remember when making videos was fun to do?
[117:13.43]Wine is complicated.
[117:15.97]Life is complicated.
[117:18.85]Do you have the right ingredients?
[117:20.16]Do you have the right timeframe?
[117:21.68]Are you ready to start your winery?
[117:24.80]Are you ready to start your life?
[117:28.08]Write that down because yes, it will be on the test.
[117:39.60]Never coming out.
[117:40.84]You'll never see it.
[117:45.32]Oh, this is where he originated.
[117:46.50]Why don't we just watch this one, too?
[117:47.70]Hey, guys!
[117:48.26]I know that Happy Time Murders looks like a kid's movie, because I'm incredibly... Let's see where he came from.
[117:57.79]Yes, I'll take some wine, please.
[118:01.59]Someone's buzzing my apartment.
[118:03.07]I might go see who it is.
[118:07.16]Ah, yes.
[118:08.42]Ah, that's a good berry wine.
[118:12.62]Who is it?
[118:15.41]Hey.
[118:16.33]Hey, it's my good friend, MLC Stiles.
[118:20.05]Come on in.
[118:20.99]I've got some fresh wine for you.
[118:22.93]This goes on for so long.
[118:24.37]See, it's right here.
[118:25.11]It's a Cabernet from the year 1444.
[118:27.39]This is the year Christopher Columbus sailed the sea.
[118:31.71]Did you know that?
[118:32.33]I love Cabernet.
[118:34.60]Yes, yes, it's good.
[118:35.80]Take some, please.
[118:36.76]Please have some.
[118:38.68]Please have some.
[118:40.88]Please.
[118:43.12]Ah, yes.
[118:45.84]How are you?
[118:48.86]Let's have some more wine.
[118:50.06]What was that in the back?
[118:51.04]Let's have some more wine.
[118:54.49]Oh, yes.
[118:55.39]Oh, yes.
[118:56.25]Yes.
[118:57.63]Oh, yes.
[118:59.17]What's this?
[119:00.23]Is it wine?
[119:01.09]I haven't had this in so long.
[119:03.44]It's been at least five seconds since my last glass.
[119:06.12]My screen is shaking.
[119:08.38]There is a dude behind us.
[119:09.52]We better get going.
[119:10.68]He's behind us.
[119:11.72]He's behind us.
[119:12.70]He's coming.
[119:13.56]There's a guy behind us.
[119:14.70]Maybe he's just going to get in the car.
[119:16.42]He's going to get in the car.
[119:18.12]Is he just going to get in?
[119:19.49]There's not enough space in the car.
[119:21.45]He's going to shoot us.
[119:22.25]It's a two-door.
[119:22.91]You better leave.
[119:24.45]No, it's a two-door.
[119:27.75]He's kicking the door.
[119:29.63]Hey, cut it out.
[119:30.55]He has a knife.
[119:31.88]Put the knife down.
[119:33.70]There's no reason for this.
[119:35.47]Look, let me get out and I'll just listen.
[119:37.71]I know your insurance, my insurance.
[119:40.03]We'll work things out.
[119:40.94]We'll exchange papers.
[119:42.08]I'll send it to you tomorrow.
[119:44.02]Alright, take us up to the top of this fucking mountain.
[119:53.74]This looks really stupid.
[119:55.70]Why?
[119:57.26]I'm in first person just behind you and it looks like it looks like one of those old 80s movies where the guy you're in front of like a green screen and you're like apparently driving right now oh wow look out this looks really great on my fucking green screen no he drives down this was so new everything was so fresh and new
[120:29.00]I'm just gonna take E.T.
[120:33.91]Oh, it was all so new.
[120:35.71]Oh my god, that is 90 degrees.
[120:38.33]That was 90 degrees.
[120:42.05]Yeah, I don't think I'll be able to get down the whole mountain.
[120:45.05]You're gonna try to get down the whole mountain like that.
[120:47.03]Sure.
[120:47.27]Oh no.
[120:48.13]Oh no.
[120:48.80]Oh, speaking of going down the whole mountain.
[120:52.53]Oh no.
[120:54.31]That was almost bad.
[120:55.09]Remember when this was going up Mount Chiliad?
[120:58.19]Why I keep trying to do that?
[120:59.95]It's not happening.
[121:00.65]You've never been able to do anything like that before in your life.
[121:03.90]Okay.
[121:04.24]See ya.
[121:04.56]See ya.
[121:04.88]Oh, E-tape on him.
[121:06.36]Oh, I'm alive.
[121:07.10]He flew off.
[121:10.68]Yeah.
[121:10.92]Going up this mountain for the first time.
[121:12.41]It was just so magical.
[121:15.03]There's the mountain.
[121:15.79]Push me.
[121:17.43]My, uh, all my lights broke.
[121:19.39]Push me.
[121:21.13]Push me.
[121:21.97]I need a push.
[121:23.43]Push me, mummy.
[121:24.97]Push me, mummy.
[121:27.39]Thank you for the boost.
[121:30.15]Oh, not your pipe!
[121:31.21]You fucking idiot.
[121:33.03]My pipe.
[121:35.53]You need to land this plane, and the nose has to be directly in front of me, just like that movie, uh, Supergun, with Thomas Cruise.
[121:43.02]I'm going really fast.
[121:45.89]You are going like kind of fast, but it's okay.
[121:47.67]You'll get it.
[121:48.09]Yeah, you did I love this part.
[121:56.49]Just staring over here while he flies off cliffs
[122:05.36]Oh no.
[122:05.90]Oh no!
[122:06.36]That's great.
[122:07.10]That's good.
[122:08.31]That's great.
[122:08.93]It's just straight face.
[122:12.63]Your guy's... Your guy's face screams as if nothing is happening.
[122:23.53]He fucking screams.
[122:25.45]He's like... It's not a big deal.
[122:28.06]I'm just driving.
[122:31.96]Yeah, you'd be like, somebody please help us.
[122:35.08]Oh, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on a second.
[122:38.51]Don't move.
[122:39.61]Do not move.
[122:40.55]I was so obsessed with just holding a camera on him.
[122:49.52]Hold on, don't, don't, don't, not yet.
[122:51.52]I want to get, like, a first-person look at you.
[122:53.30]I want to, like, take a picture of you.
[122:57.82]What are you doing?
[122:58.38]You're rocking up to the music.
[123:01.89]What a sick fuck.
[123:03.81]Carry on my wayward son.
[123:05.02]Your character is a psycho.
[123:06.44]What's wrong with my face?
[123:15.65]How beautiful of a sight is this?
[123:19.71]I just love sitting here parked, looking outside of the wonderful islands and all the other great stuff in this wonderful world.
[123:34.91]No.
[123:36.93]Who wants to play this game?
[123:38.75]I want to play.
[123:40.55]What the fuck?
[123:41.43]Just to drive over mountains and fly.
[123:47.13]Alright, cab's coming.
[123:49.27]I got us a cab.
[123:50.03]Can we both get in the cab?
[123:51.43]What happens here?
[123:52.33]Um, I don't know.
[123:55.17]Well, don't get in it yet.
[123:58.75]Okay, um, hi.
[123:59.11]That's not a cab.
[124:01.47]That's not a cab at all.
[124:02.49]That's a, uh... What kind of cab company sends a fucking chopper and shoots you?
[124:10.24]That's kind of funny.
[124:21.54]Into frame.
[124:23.38]Are you still alive?
[124:24.84]No, I'm not alive.
[124:29.27]This bottle is from Thomas Jefferson, circa 17 B.C.
[124:33.45]Oh, yeah, that's got some aroma to it.
[124:37.05]Oh, yes, that's got a nice little flavor to it.
[124:39.67]Kind of reminds me of poison.
[124:44.84]Yeah, Grand Theft Auto.
[124:49.74]Well, always.
[124:51.50]No one will ever do it better.
[124:54.16]No one will ever do just walk up and haymaker somebody as hard as you can in the face.
[125:00.63]No company they've tried, they will never get it.
[125:04.83]Only Rockstar has mastered that.
[125:08.41]The act of just...
[125:10.46]haymaker into somebody's face.
[125:12.02]I remember the first time doing that in GTA 5.
[125:14.90]I was with Burgah Boy at Burgah Boy's house.
[125:17.44]And I've never seen him laugh harder than anything else.
[125:20.70]That was the hardest he's ever laughed in his whole life.
[125:23.14]He walked up to some lady and just did a full, like, punch directly into her face.
[125:28.70]And it was just, it was out-fucking-rageous.
[125:31.14]You've never seen anything like that before.
[125:33.89]Oh my god.
[125:35.95]It was just totally fucking, just total absurdity.
[125:40.63]This is like a bag of groceries or something.
[125:44.21]And he just, just full on fucking clocked her.
[125:50.44]What?
[125:50.88]Are you serious?
[125:53.02]Holy shit.
[125:53.42]There's a, there's a bee in here.
[125:55.10]Oh, fuck me.
[125:55.84]Goodbye.
[125:56.86]Not goodbye.
[125:57.46]Hold on.
[126:00.34]There, I, is there really?
[126:02.16]No, there, there, I heard it.
[126:04.08]I just heard it.
[126:04.56]I did.
[126:07.90]Tell me if it's in here.
[126:08.90]I'm going to leave the room for like a minute.
[126:10.26]Tell me if it's in here.
[126:11.04]For real.
[126:13.10]I'll be back in like a minute.
[126:13.90]Tell me if it's actually in here.
[126:31.13]I swear to God I heard it.
[126:41.96]I think it's right there.
[126:42.68]Is that right there?
[126:57.61]I'm not fucking around right now.
[126:59.31]I actually like really think I heard it.
[127:03.52]Tell me for real.
[127:04.12]What?
[127:18.40]It's real.
[127:19.10]It's real.
[127:19.52]It's real.
[127:20.02]It's real.
[127:20.40]It's there.
[127:20.78]Right there.
[127:25.38]Fuck.
[127:25.78]Why are they coming down here now?
[127:27.38]Fuck.
[127:31.12]That means more than one's probably in here.
[127:32.76]God damn it.
[127:33.84]Fuck me.
[127:37.00]They might be like, this is why.
[127:38.36]Remember I told you?
[127:39.36]Remember I told you guys this is why I didn't want to stream for more than a couple hours?
[127:42.89]Because I needed to be on top of it.
[127:46.77]God damn it, man.
[127:47.81]Give me a break.
[127:50.97]There's a fucking hornet this big right over there.
[127:58.91]Hey, I gotta go.
[128:00.75]I gotta get out of here.
[128:02.43]I gotta go.
[128:02.85]I gotta get out of here, guys.
[128:03.95]I gotta go.
[128:04.73]I gotta get out of here.
[128:08.56]That means there's probably like three or four in the house now.
[128:15.27]I was making it up.
[128:16.69]I didn't make it up.
[128:21.19]They're fucking... But where is it, is the question.
[128:36.24]Alright, I got to fucking Labo.
[128:38.06]I got the Labo bike.
[128:56.23]Not in my office.
[128:57.79]They were in my bedroom.
[129:01.64]I actually do.
[129:03.34]I don't want to get stung.
[129:06.16]No, that's just the AC.
[129:09.97]$50 wasp.
[129:17.81]I don't know where he is.
[129:34.39]He's on head.
[129:35.25]Shut up.
[129:36.26]Stop this.
[129:37.14]Alright, bye.
[129:39.42]Chair?
[129:39.84]Shut up.
[129:40.74]Stop doing this to me.
[129:44.00]He's... I told you, this is the cyber bully.
[129:49.08]This is the cyber bullying stuff I was talking about.
[129:51.62]I confronted the bully.
[129:53.06]I confronted him.
[129:54.26]I confronted the cyber bully.
[129:56.22]There he is.
[129:56.74]He's literally on the fucking table.
[129:59.70]He's right there.
[130:00.62]He's fucking right there.
[130:04.35]He's fucking huge, too.
[130:05.77]Shit!
[130:19.30]We made this joke all stream, and they're coming into this room now.
[130:24.22]God, fuck.
[130:31.47]Fuck.
[130:33.20]I actually do have to leave because that means there are like another few that I have to take care of in the house.
[130:38.90]Just kill it.
[130:39.50]There's so much equipment here.
[130:40.69]I can't just like fucking wildly throw like a GTA punch.
[130:51.05]These things are aggressive and they're mean.
[131:03.41]He's over here.
[131:04.27]I got like two monitors.
[131:06.23]The mic switches right there.
[131:07.57]I got my mic.
[131:08.61]I can't just start fucking trying to throw punches, man.
[131:15.86]Get the vacuum?
[131:16.64]That's not going to work.
[131:22.72]He might climb in front of the webcam.
[131:29.97]He's going to climb across the webcam.
[131:42.37]He's behind it.
[131:51.84]Motherfucker, I swear.
[131:54.66]Alright, fun and games are over.
[131:58.66]Let me just see.
[131:59.36]Somebody give 50 fucking dollars.
[132:06.07]Cut the stream and run.
[132:10.00]Is there another one behind me, too?
[132:11.28]There really might be.
[132:12.10]There might be three or four in here.
[132:14.12]Fuck you.
[132:14.54]He sees me.
[132:14.90]He's looking at me.
[132:17.72]He looks like he's trying to come after me.
[132:20.42]He's pissed.
[132:25.92]Fuck.
[132:32.05]Alright.
[132:41.01]Every time I walk over to like touch the mouse, he comes back out.
[132:48.73]Fucking thing sucks.
[132:56.40]What is this gonna do?
[132:58.62]What if I catch him and he's... What is he doing?
[133:07.50]He's going like this with his ass and his stinger is coming out.
[133:14.43]What is he doing?
[133:17.69]He's doing like a yoga move.
[133:26.75]Oh, shit.
[133:30.32]Hey, welcome to the stream, guys.
[133:33.54]He is pissed.
[133:35.98]It's because the guy put this powder in the wall and it's fucking him all up.
[133:42.23]He put like this anti-hornet wasp powder.
[133:45.58]And now they're all pissed off and they're getting in the house again.
[133:52.44]I don't know what to do about this.
[133:55.28]Because he's very agitated.
[133:56.44]Alright, let me, let me... Dunkin' Donuts.
[134:03.39]I got two Dunkin' Donuts coffees here.
[134:11.59]Large
[134:12.35]To the medium.
[134:16.17]I can dump the ice out, Dunkin' Donuts them.
[134:27.04]Any of the cups?
[134:39.20]This stream is so off the rails, man.
[134:46.96]This is what you're watching right now.
[134:56.81]I'm not throwing anything at it.
[135:10.55]Got the coffee.
[135:11.35]Got the coffee.
[135:14.25]I thought there was a bee in here.
[135:21.44]It's too cold.
[135:22.00]That's too cold.
[135:32.87]What do I do about it?
[135:52.09]Where is he?
[135:56.05]Where is he?
[135:56.46]I'm just gonna leave the stream on.
[136:14.88]I can't even see the chat either.
[136:15.94]I gotta get my phone and I gotta read the chat from my iPad.
[136:18.40]Tell me where it is.
[136:18.96]I'm gonna get my iPad, tell me where it is.

[138:29.58]Use emotes to tell me where he is.
[138:36.53]Is there like an up or down emote?
[138:42.00]I gotta get my phone.

[141:56.52]I don't know what to do.

[143:37.67]There's another one in here.
[143:39.07]I just heard it.
[143:57.28]Unbelievable.
[144:03.25]He's not back.
[144:03.77]He's under there.
[144:05.61]I just heard another one just zip around my head.
[144:09.05]Am I paranoid?
[144:09.75]Am I panicking for no reason?
[144:18.33]Are you sure?
[144:21.82]What did I just step on?
[144:23.66]Oh, that's ice.
[144:24.54]That's ice.
[144:27.02]Everything.
[144:33.68]He's not dead.
[144:37.86]He came back to life.
[144:40.65]I just crushed him like four times.
[144:44.77]He's playing dead.
[144:46.49]I'll deal with him in a minute.
[144:47.41]Okay.
[144:48.01]Now I can sit down here for a second.
[144:52.75]He sneaks under there.
[144:53.69]No, I gotta put a weight on that.
[144:56.13]What if he gets out?
[145:11.02]There's another one right here.
[145:15.76]He's staring at me.
[145:18.52]Oh, fuck me, man.
[145:20.10]He's right there.
[145:31.89]There's another one.
[145:33.95]Okay, just like a T-Rex, right?
[145:35.31]If you don't fucking move.
[145:41.57]Why are they coming down here?
[145:56.57]He's dead, right?
[146:13.55]You want proof?
[146:15.01]I'll give you proof.
[146:18.37]Can you see it?
[146:21.97]Here.
[146:50.50]Okay, uh... I think it's time that I leave.
[146:55.84]Uh, time to go.
[146:57.92]Because this is turning into bedroom two.
[147:02.46]Tiny, he's curled up.
[147:03.62]He curled up into a little ball.
[147:05.90]Those are... Yes, they are.
[147:06.74]These are wasps.
[147:09.32]These are yellow jackets.
[147:11.66]They're hornets.
[147:22.28]That's not a honey bee.
[147:24.32]That is not a honey bee.
[147:26.58]I know what a honey bee looks like.
[147:27.98]Hey, thanks for watching.
[147:33.41]Subscribe for more content.
[147:36.69]Where the beer at?
[147:38.93]Alright.
[147:40.61]I have to leave because I'm not going to deal with this all stream.
[147:43.76]I got to fucking... I got to get out of this room.
[147:47.30]I ain't getting hurt.
[147:48.02]I'm not going to get fucking stunk.
[147:52.18]We're looking at like an escape route here in a minute.
[147:54.32]Let me see.
[147:54.76]What do we got for bits?
[147:57.56]I'm going to rapid fire these bits.
[148:01.36]Where are they?
[148:04.80]Okay, here we go.
[148:07.18]First of all, Edgemont viewers.
[148:09.38]There's like 4,100 people here.
[148:10.76]Hope you enjoyed a wuss of a man take on two hornets.
[148:17.82]From his iPhone.
[148:19.76]Or three.
[148:20.36]Yep, three.
[148:23.15]Do you hear it?
[148:25.41]You hear it, right?
[148:33.16]I think there might be a car in the distance.
[148:35.66]That is a car.
[148:36.26]That's like a motorcycle.
[148:40.40]Anyways, Overcooked 2.
[148:45.97]Hopefully...
[148:48.20]Unless there's more hornets in this fucking room.
[148:52.04]Otherwise, I'm gonna have to stream from upstairs or something.
[148:54.07]I can't even be upstairs.
[148:54.93]This one is upstairs too.
[148:57.29]Clean my floor.
[148:57.83]That's Nintendo Labo shit that I punched out.
[149:05.04]Uh, me and Etalyx are gonna play Overcooked 2.
[149:08.70]I might have to stream from somewhere else besides this room.
[149:13.14]Here's what I don't understand though.
[149:17.69]Hornets, they're not active right now.
[149:19.47]It's 10.30 at night.
[149:22.35]They go dormant at 5 or 6 o'clock, don't they?
[149:24.87]Why the fuck are they doing this?
[149:31.50]But regardless, the lights, your lights are the sun.
[149:42.50]They smell fear, revenge,
[149:48.21]It's from the powder.
[149:53.24]The pest guy that came here today said that they were hornets.
[149:59.91]They party all night.
[150:01.05]Alright, but hey, thanks for sticking around.
[150:03.49]Those of you that hung out for as long as you did.
[150:04.97]A lot of people came out tonight.
[150:06.39]Thanks, guys.
[150:08.23]I'll see you tomorrow, wherever that may be.
[150:14.70]So have a good rest of your night.
[150:16.30]Let's get through the bits very, very quickly here.
[150:18.92]I'm just, I got to get out of the room, so I'm going to read names and say thank you very much, especially to Edgemont for $50.
[150:25.92]Good luck exterminating the bees.
[150:28.20]I think Etalyx might have some tips on getting rid of wasps.
[150:32.24]Well, he's got good tips on how to get rid of one, not like 30, because that's how many have been in my house over the last two days.
[150:40.86]So maybe he can help me.
[150:45.89]called Jax.
[150:47.69]But thank you so much, Edgemont.
[150:49.41]I really appreciate it.
[150:50.15]And let's go back earlier tonight.
[150:52.39]Let's get through these rapid fire.

[152:17.70]I would have them removed by a service that will take them out.
[152:20.36]I don't want to hurt bees.
[152:21.96]Hornets, on the other hand, they're terrifying, and they're just mean by nature.
[152:27.34]They're just mean little shits.

[155:13.97]I feel your pain.
[155:14.59]I've been dealing with bats in my house for a week, and it's given me total PTSD.
[155:22.13]I can handle mammals, though.
[155:23.37]I really can.
[155:25.39]I feel like mammals understand me.
[155:28.41]Right?
[155:28.83]But we're all mammals.
[155:31.49]But bugs, they have no remorse.
[155:34.66]They don't know anything.
[155:35.42]They're morons.
[155:38.93]I can handle a mammal.
[155:42.34]Although they're bigger and much harder to deal with.
[155:47.58]Bats are bugs.
[155:48.39]No, they're not.
[155:49.73]Thank you, Raincoat, for the $15.

[157:38.61]Thank you, guys.
[157:40.33]Frexter, thanks for the one dollar.
[157:41.85]ACFan, dollar 19.
[157:44.74]Al the chemist, thanks for the two bucks.
[157:47.08]Fourth consecutive line, thanks for five dollars here.
[157:49.74]Hey Jerm, I've had a fair bit of deep cheer messages before, but I think I still have some ideas to expand upon.
[157:56.75]Namely, I think you do as good a job as a person can entertain in entertaining others.
[158:01.63]And not only because you're naturally talented to do so, but because you care.
[158:05.65]Everything you do, live or video, is to entertain, and I think you deserve all the credit.
[158:09.45]I think this is evidenced by your fans' tenacity and talent in their contributions.
[158:13.63]and reactions, etc.
[158:15.71]I wholeheartedly agree.
[158:19.46]I think, as a community, I think we stand very strong.
[158:24.94]Judging by the fucking bee videos.
[158:27.26]The hornet videos.
[158:27.96]Like those, that was, I loved every second of that.
[158:30.10]Thanks, guys.
[158:31.98]And then fourth consecutive line, again for $5.
[158:33.48]I think you deserve the praise because you selflessly put yourself out there in order to make others happy.
[158:41.34]It takes a strong person to allow for the chance to let others make fun of you.
[158:44.64]I wish you luck on your move.
[158:45.84]And I hope that you take to heart that all your fans, not excluding me, love you and that all that you do and appreciate the effort you put forth to make us laugh.
[158:57.15]Thank you.
[158:57.45]It means a lot.
[159:01.23]I'm going to try, right?
[159:05.02]If you guys are having fun, that's all I care about.
[159:08.78]That's all I've ever cared about.
[159:09.80]So let's keep doing it, right?
[159:13.00]Thank you for those two very kind messages.
[159:15.42]Fourth consecutive line.
[159:18.42]And then we had a bunch of dollars here.
[159:19.84]Sticks Renegade for the dollar.
[159:21.04]Darkstar 7000.
[159:22.16]Cap'n Flapjack.
[159:24.94]Sir Feline.
[159:25.84]Fourth consecutive line.
[159:26.76]Again for two dollars.
[159:27.62]Thanks for the dollar, Sir Feline, as well.
[159:31.61]Thank you, guys.
[159:34.23]Gudun.
[159:34.79]Thanks for the ten bucks, Gudun.
[159:37.25]Hey, Jerma, I've been a fan for at least five years, and I want to say it's been a blast.
[159:40.87]But for all these years, I've never been the ruler of my own dreams.
[159:44.55]I've seen the gates of oblivion beyond which no waking eye may see.
[159:48.57]Behold, in darkness... Hold on.
[159:52.34]I think he's on the table.
[159:57.56]Thank you.
[159:59.06]Thank you, Guden, for the ten bucks.
[160:01.84]I really appreciate that.
[160:02.66]Thank you so much, man.
[160:05.69]Cool Cat, thanks for the $5.
[160:07.91]I'm really happy you laughed at my dumb bee video.
[160:10.67]It was the one with Mr. Peanut.
[160:11.73]Feels good to give back some laughs.
[160:13.85]Thanks, man.

[161:54.61]I said they were hornets.

[162:18.87]Thank you, everybody.
[162:20.82]Let's run the credits, and I'm going to sprint out of this room.
[162:24.68]Now, without further ado, if for some reason I can't stream from this house tomorrow because these fucking hornets are everywhere again, I will let you know.
[162:34.37]But regardless of that, Overcooked 2 is the plan tomorrow.
[162:37.95]I will see, I'll let you know.
[162:40.59]So, here come the credits.
