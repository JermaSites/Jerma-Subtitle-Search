[00:01.48]Hey, what is going on, Method Gaming?
[00:03.54]Jerma here.
[00:04.36]It's been a while.
[00:06.62]It's been at least a week since I put a video out on this channel.
[00:10.51]I really do apologize for that, but there are legitimate reasons why I haven't done it.
[00:15.61]I'll try and give you the excuses right now.
[00:18.65]So the reason why I haven't had my homework in a couple weeks is because I changed ISPs.
[00:24.33]Hold on, gotta get rid of this Mini-Sentry, dude.
[00:27.01]I changed ISPs, and I wanted to get faster upload speeds, faster download speeds, and it worked for a little while, and then everything just broke, and I couldn't do anything.
[00:37.51]My upload speeds were terrible.
[00:39.98]A guy, a technician, had to come and redo all the wires in the house and put a new cable line in and stuff, so it was a pain in my butt.
[00:48.16]But that's all settled now.
[00:49.30]That's all taken care of.
[00:51.80]Air shot.
[00:52.70]Oh, damn it.
[00:54.44]You see?
[00:54.76]He ain't died.
[00:56.30]So that's why I haven't really done many videos lately, even for my own channel.
[01:01.39]I had pre-recorded stuff that I just rendered out and tried to upload.
[01:06.73]And my uploads were taking an hour and a half on this new internet at one point.
[01:11.20]And it was just like, give me a break.
[01:13.22]Paying like $100 a month for this new crazy internet.
[01:16.70]And it just sucks.
[01:18.49]But it's fixed now, like I said.
[01:19.85]Everything's good, everything's golden.
[01:21.71]Playing as the Demoman on CP Gorge.
[01:26.01]Oh, somebody'd run over that crit.
[01:27.37]Somebody'd run over that crit, like you.
[01:28.88]Boink.
[01:30.64]I'm using the default grenade launcher, the default sticky launcher, and I'm using the frying pan, which is always fun.
[01:39.20]Let's see if I can't make my way over here.
[01:42.61]I need to be healed.
[01:44.59]Heal me, Medic!
[01:46.29]Help me!
[01:47.79]Oh, sentry.
[01:48.57]Oh, that's gone.
[01:49.46]Ready?
[01:50.08]Guarantee that sentry's gonna be gone, like, right now.
[01:53.48]No.
[01:55.12]Oh, no!
[01:56.10]No, hey, forget that.
[01:57.22]Scratch that.
[01:57.86]I didn't say that.
[02:00.62]If that uber didn't come out, it would've happened.
[02:03.71]If that uber charge did not come out, I would've killed it.
[02:09.23]And I'm also... I'm starting to get a cold.
[02:11.69]Don't know if you can really hear it in my voice or not, but I'm starting to get a head cold.
[02:16.13]Because it's December.
[02:18.56]And in December, you get sick.
[02:21.36]That's just what happens in December.
[02:23.34]No, no, heal me.
[02:24.28]I'll get this.
[02:25.16]I will get... No, heal me.
[02:26.27]No, do it to me.
[02:28.11]Oh, fine.
[02:28.63]I'll just take the heat.
[02:31.53]Here's a pro tip for you.
[02:32.89]We're going to win.
[02:33.41]Yeah, we're going to win the game right now.
[02:37.50]But let me give you a tip.
[02:39.80]If you have an Uber Charge and there's a Demoman around, use the Uber Charge on the Demoman.
[02:45.14]If you know, if he has the Sticky Launcher like I did, an Uber Demo is way, way better than an Uber Heavy in every single situation when you have to take out a Sentry Gun.
[02:54.98]So if you're going for a Sentry Gun kill, Uber a Demoman.
[02:58.20]Do not Uber a Heavy.
[03:00.61]Unless, of course, there's no Demoman on the team.
[03:02.67]Then you can do whatever you want.
[03:07.11]Okay, well, I just came back from a hard crash.
[03:10.99]An HL2EXE crash.
[03:12.67]I haven't gotten one of those in a long time, so that's kind of unnerving.
[03:16.93]But anyways, I'm going to play Spy now.
[03:20.27]Still on defense.
[03:21.27]Some time went down, but that's okay.
[03:24.07]Let's see.
[03:24.55]Okay, they haven't got out here yet.
[03:25.57]I'm using the Caniver's Kunai and the Dead Ringer and the Ambassador.
[03:30.08]And let's see if I can't make something happen to Spy here.
[03:36.77]Alright.
[03:38.19]If you don't know, watch my health when I get a backstab.
[03:41.29]It goes all the way up, you get healed.
[03:43.17]Oh, I gotta get this guy.
[03:47.30]The Conniver's Kunai makes you absorb damage on people when you stab them, and I need to... I'm just sitting here with no disguise on.
[03:56.44]Give me the health, quick!
[03:58.19]Nice.
[04:00.17]Uh-oh.
[04:01.01]Can I get that guy?
[04:05.43]Let's see if I can't get behind this soldier over here and stab him.
[04:11.31]Oh, I got him.
[04:12.67]See my health?
[04:13.83]180.
[04:13.95]You get overhealed and everything.
[04:15.23]It's awesome.
[04:16.97]Get out of my way!
[04:19.75]Get out of... God.
[04:21.61]Oh, I'm so dead.
[04:23.23]Give me this guy!
[04:23.79]Give me this guy!
[04:24.31]Give me him!
[04:24.67]Give me him!
[04:25.01]Yes!
[04:27.43]Of course I get crit.
[04:28.37]Of course it happens.
[04:32.83]I used to be like the best spy ever.
[04:36.16]Back in Vanilla TF2, before all the updates, before all the new stuff came out, all the new items, I was one of the best spies in Team Fortress.
[04:44.40]I can safely say that.
[04:45.66]Back in, like, 2007, I was the spy.
[04:50.05]If you ran into jermaOn a server, you did not like it.
[04:53.31]You were not happy.
[04:55.41]And then after all the updates and all the items and all the free-to-play updates and everything, I kind of lost my ability to play spy.
[05:03.85]I kind of started to really suck at it.
[05:06.76]Uh-oh, I'm done.
[05:07.66]Goodbye.
[05:08.06]Game over.
[05:08.54]I lose.
[05:09.80]Wow.
[05:10.20]Yeah, I'm dead.
[05:12.42]See if I can't headshot this guy.
[05:19.55]That was really stupid.
[05:20.97]Should not have done that.
[05:24.45]Oh, drinking my coffee.
[05:26.87]Did I really just get auto-balanced?
[05:29.76]I just got auto-balanced.
[05:30.98]Come on.
[05:33.04]We were about to win that in a minute.
[05:35.70]And I got auto-balanced.
[05:37.96]Are you kidding me?
[05:38.74]And here's the guy that just killed me.
[05:41.14]You jerk.
[05:43.88]Kill me.
[05:44.32]Somebody kill me so I can get some stabs before this game is over.
[05:51.16]Alright.
[05:52.01]Here we go.
[05:53.83]Oh my god.
[05:54.47]There's so much chaos going on.
[05:55.87]I don't know what to do.
[05:57.13]Help me.
[06:02.00]I got the guy that blew the horn.
[06:03.16]Oh, get me behind.
[06:04.24]Oh, I hope you guys are ready for this, because I'm probably going to get like seven kills in a row.
[06:08.58]No, I'm not.
[06:09.89]I'm going to die now, because this pyro, actually, maybe I'll get him.
[06:14.83]Oh, headshot.
[06:16.95]Oh.
[06:20.39]Here we go.
[06:22.35]Here's the ultimate test.
[06:23.35]Last 20 seconds.
[06:24.15]Give me a chain stab of like five people in a row.
[06:27.07]What do you say?
[06:27.90]Or two.
[06:31.90]Oh, yike.
[06:37.12]Is there anybody else?
[06:37.82]This guy over here?
[06:39.02]Oh, we're going to get on it.
[06:39.64]We're going to cap it.
[06:41.42]Are we actually going to cap it?
[06:42.47]I think so.
[06:43.47]One.
[06:44.43]And... Two.
[06:47.63]Oh, I still got overtime.
[06:48.87]Overtime.
[06:49.27]Oh, my God.
[06:50.29]No.
[06:50.97]Somebody else, help me.
[06:52.03]Help me.
[06:53.37]It's over.
[06:55.38]Well, thank you guys so much for watching this crazy coffee live commentary.
[07:00.64]Sorry I crashed out in the beginning or in the middle there.
[07:03.04]That was kind of weird.
[07:03.90]But I'll see you guys all next time.
[07:06.10]And take care, everybody.
