[00:08.81]Hey, what is going on everybody?
[00:10.61]Jerma here with a Team Fortress 2 gameplay commentary.
[00:14.88]And tonight, playing as the Demoman on Thunder Mountain.
[00:20.87]I can't do the noise with my mouth.
[00:22.19]But you understand, on Thunder Mountain right now is the Demoman with a very, very, very weird setup.
[00:27.66]Before I get really into this commentary at all, I want to talk about the setup.
[00:31.82]So I'm using the Alibaba's Wii booties, the sticky launcher, and the frying pan.
[00:37.14]Now, the reason why I did this, I'm kind of sick of doing the whole regular Demoman setup because the Demoman doesn't have really any options.
[00:45.75]He only has two real primaries and two real secondaries.
[00:50.95]I mean, I don't really even count the shields.
[00:53.73]I mean, they are weapons, but they're not technically weapons.
[00:56.42]They just add a mechanic.
[00:57.96]They add a charge mechanic into the game.
[01:00.04]So what I'm talking about, I'm talking about real weapons.
[01:02.82]I really do wish Valve would stop making all these melee unlockables for the Demoman and actually focus on some new primaries and some new secondaries.
[01:12.38]Because we need them.
[01:13.54]Because there's nothing else you can really do.
[01:16.05]And personally, I really don't like the Scottish Resistance.
[01:20.23]I think the Scottish Resistance is too weird to use.
[01:23.19]I can't really get used to it.
[01:24.59]So somebody like me that doesn't ever use the Scottish Resistance...
[01:28.66]I just have the default sticky launcher and I have a shield I can put on.
[01:32.72]So what I'm doing right now is I'm doing a weird kind of different setup than not very many people do.
[01:39.13]And it's the Ali Baba's Wee Booties, like I said, and the sticky launcher specifically to get the extra health.
[01:44.69]So I'm really just a sticky bomb tank.
[01:47.07]It's really what I am.
[01:48.72]Because I've been looking back at my Demoman videos, and even playing as the Demoman, whenever I play as the damn Demoman, I always just use the default stuff.
[01:59.56]Unless I'm doing a Demoknight, and I gotta get away from that.
[02:02.24]This is kind of my way to change it up a little bit and stop using the same damn items over and over and over again.
[02:10.28]And this is a very odd setup.
[02:11.80]And it is, even though it is odd.
[02:13.79]It is a lot of fun, and it's actually pretty useful.
[02:17.12]It's pretty much just putting on the Darwin's Danger Shield for the sniper.
[02:21.97]And yes, you do lose your grenade launcher, but honestly, for the most part, most of us use the grenade launcher for spam anyways.
[02:30.25]Some of us are okay, though.
[02:31.15]Some of us can get those great Demoman Direct shots.
[02:34.24]And for that, you guys, I commend you.
[02:35.86]I give you a clap.
[02:36.84]I give you applause.
[02:38.04]Because sometimes it's difficult for me to do that, unless I'm using the lock and load.
[02:41.62]But it takes the spam factor away from you and makes you really have to focus with your sticky launchers and you get extra health.
[02:49.35]So until Valve adds some new primaries and secondaries, some new innovative primaries and secondaries for the Demoman, I'll probably be rolling around with this for a little while.
[03:00.55]So for the next half of the commentary I want to talk about, I want to get away from the game and the gameplay for a little bit, and I want to discuss exercise.
[03:08.49]Exercising and the gym.
[03:10.71]Because I remember in my last Q&A video I told you guys that I was getting a little sloppy, I hadn't been to the gym in a long time, it's been like three months, and I finally just went back yesterday
[03:21.96]I went with Burger Boy and we got destroyed.
[03:25.06]We did a chest and triceps workout and I felt like I hadn't worked out ever before in my entire life.
[03:30.88]Like I was so tired and my muscles are so sore right now.
[03:35.20]But forget about all that.
[03:37.12]I want to talk about, I want to talk to you guys specifically about my workout routine and my workout story.
[03:43.86]And maybe after listening to this commentary, if you were on the fence before, maybe you'll start doing it too.
[03:49.76]Because, I mean, I do get asked this quite often, at least in PMs.
[03:53.27]I mean, it's not like every single day somebody's like, how do you do workouts?
[03:56.55]But I have been asked a couple times.
[03:58.29]So I do want to get this video out so people can understand that here's my story.
[04:04.57]I was a little, little dude.
[04:06.79]Back when I was in high school, I probably was 115 pounds.
[04:13.01]I was like 5'2", and I was 115 pounds.
[04:16.71]And after I got out of high school, I went to college.
[04:19.45]I gained a little bit of weight in college.
[04:21.05]I went to probably 135 or like 138 in college.
[04:25.90]And after college, that's kind of when I said...
[04:29.06]Okay, I am getting really sick and tired of being the smallest person in the room.
[04:34.80]I would look around and see everybody was bigger than me, everyone was stronger than me, and I got sick of that.
[04:39.92]And even in talking about women and relationship stuff, I wanted to be more desirable.
[04:45.58]I wanted to be a guy that girls would point to and say, wow, he's, look at that, look at those arms.
[04:53.04]And plus, I wanted to get healthier, too, because I have always been kind of like a health nut.
[04:57.10]I've always wanted to be the healthiest I can be.
[04:59.69]And I mean, it's not like I didn't try this before.
[05:01.91]I never really worked out that much, but I did try to put on weight, and oh my god, I could not put on one pound to save my life.
[05:11.33]I could eat 25 double cheeseburgers from McDonald's, and I wouldn't gain one pound.
[05:17.25]And I was always so naive.
[05:18.61]I thought- I really did think that eating garbage fatty foods was gonna make me bigger and make me gain weight, but that's not really what that stuff does.
[05:28.18]You'll gain weight if you eat cheeseburgers, or if you eat something really bad for you.
[05:33.06]You'll gain weight, but it's not the type of weight that you want to gain.
[05:37.04]Yeah, I mean, maybe you'll gain four or five pounds, but it'll all be in your butt cheeks.
[05:41.55]Like, you won't get, like, biceps by eating McDonald's.
[05:44.44]I'll tell you that right now.
[05:46.62]And to sort of end this video, I want to talk about what it's really done for me, and what it can really do for you, too.
[05:52.58]If you start working out, if you really get into it, I've seen such massive results, guys.
[05:57.91]I've gained probably at least 40 or 50 pounds since I started a couple years ago.
[06:03.89]And even though I have slowed down a little bit, I'm trying to get back into it now, but I've just seen such amazing results over the last couple years.
[06:11.67]I got as strong as an ox, too.
[06:14.38]And I'm not the smallest guy in the room anymore.
[06:16.86]I'm one of the bigger guys in the room.
[06:18.78]And that alone is so insane for your confidence.
[06:22.16]If you can get to a point where you look in the mirror and you go, who is that guy?
[06:26.27]Oh my God.
[06:27.85]You will feel so much better about yourself.
[06:29.89]And it's done so many good things for me.
[06:32.33]So maybe in the future I'll make another video like this describing my actual routine and some of the things I do on a daily basis to stay healthy and to gain weight and to get bigger.
[06:43.04]But for now, I just wanted to give you that little story.
[06:45.46]So I will see you guys all soon.
[06:47.52]Take care, everybody.
