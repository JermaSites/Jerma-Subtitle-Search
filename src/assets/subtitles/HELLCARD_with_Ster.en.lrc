[ve:60.16.100]

[00:22.96]Hello, how are you?
[00:26.45]Early stream earlier earlier.
[00:29.21]Everybody had a good 4th of July.
[00:39.69]That sounded like I just sipped a bunch of whipped cream off.
[00:46.82]Well, I don't even care.
[00:49.52]It's a new me.
[00:51.36]I'm not going to do something that sounds weird and then explain it for five minutes.
[00:54.23]No, it's a new me.
[00:56.17]New me.
[01:03.61]Yes, you will.
[01:04.35]Probably.
[01:11.52]And in pre-stream earlier, somebody was saying, oh man, I... What ever happened to the... That, like, jacked... Like, wicked red Jerma.
[01:22.28]Man, like, what happened to him?
[01:23.70]I just want to say... Welcome 25 to 35.
[01:28.04]Good luck.
[01:28.30]Mm-hmm.
[01:28.52]Yeah, 25 to 35.
[01:28.72]Okay.
[01:28.90]We'll see.
[01:44.06]new you're old they were just joking as am I as am I don't worry we're all joking here so today we're playing with Ster Ster is here I don't want to introduce him yet because I want to be a big surprise when he shows up
[02:08.82]the plan today Ster was like hey this is game called hail card looks pretty cool I was like yeah I'll get it so I got it we also have two other games that we might move to maybe not we'll see I didn't mean it in a bad way no I know I'm just kidding around too I have a very important question for Ster actually a couple
[02:36.37]Hey, I have a couple questions for you.
[02:39.31]Oh, yeah.
[02:41.59]Question number one.
[02:43.49]What temperature do you put your thermostat on a hot day?
[02:49.01]That's a really complicated variable question.
[02:52.64]It is.
[02:52.98]I know it's loaded.
[02:55.18]Because in the winter, I was explaining this the other day, you got to set it at a certain temperature at which the AC triggers, not the temperature you actually want it.
[03:05.65]Do you understand what I'm saying?
[03:06.51]So like in the summer, if I turn on the AC and put it at like 78, it'll trigger and it'll be really cold in here.
[03:14.64]But in the winter, if I put it at like 72, that's when it'll... I don't know.
[03:19.54]That suits me.
[03:19.94]But you said 78.
[03:21.28]Are you...
[03:23.51]Well, I don't think it's actually 78 in here.
[03:25.69]That's what I'm saying is that it's like the AC is fighting the fact that it's 100 degrees outside and it's just on.
[03:34.36]I would like a true thermostat because this thing, I think it's a liar.
[03:38.44]You also have the same problem where the room that you are in right now gets to like 100 degrees, but then you will go out of that room and the room that actually has a thermostat in it is like nice and cool.
[03:50.47]Yeah, well, that's the also if you stream in a room, it will be 80 degrees.
[03:54.26]There's no way around it.
[03:55.84]Yeah, those of you that have like your gamer room.
[03:58.72]So I put my AC when I'm streaming. 73.
[04:03.86]OK, yeah.
[04:05.78]I usually try to keep my between 76, 75, 77.
[04:10.20]Maybe if I'm not really streaming or anything.
[04:13.31]I could feel that.
[04:14.73]Good answer.
[04:16.63]Yeah, well, like if it was 75 or 78, this room would be 85 degrees to 90 regardless of the the rest of my apartment would be cold.
[04:26.29]So I put it at 73 so it like continues.
[04:29.86]To pump cold air in here, because otherwise it doesn't care.
[04:32.34]I don't exist to my AC.
[04:33.81]Alright, what about, let me ask you this, what about the, I'm seeing a lot of people in the chat right now, and I know a lot of people in my, you know, personal life too, like friends and family members that say that I'm fucking nuts for having my thermostat at like 77 or 76.
[04:47.26]Because they're like, what are you talking about?
[04:51.30]Like, it needs to be in the low 70s or high 60s for me.
[04:55.46]And to me, that kind of, that's kind of like a, like, like a freezer to me.
[05:00.01]Is it to you too?
[05:03.19]I don't know.
[05:04.25]See, that's where it all comes down.
[05:05.97]It might be 60 in the rest of my apartment sometimes, even though it's set to like 73.
[05:11.99]That's what I'm saying.
[05:12.87]I feel like I don't get an even distribution.
[05:15.31]If you set your thermostat to like, if it's a hot day or whatever, if it's like during summer and you set your thermostat to 68, I'm not even sure my therm, I don't think I could even get the temperature to be 70 degrees right now if I tried.
[05:27.79]It's just like 110 degrees out right now, 105, whatever it is.
[05:31.73]I'm not even sure it could actually even happen.
[05:34.90]Do you like going out in 105 degree weather?
[05:37.34]Actually, I do.
[05:38.38]And that's like, that makes me a weird person.
[05:39.88]That's the thing too.
[05:41.66]If it's 105 out, I want to go outside.
[05:43.54]But then when I'm inside, it's got to be really cold.
[05:46.26]If it's like, if it gets to like 80, 90 in here, it's disgusting.
[05:49.06]I can't handle that.
[05:50.28]So you like it at like 110 outside and you like it at like 70 inside.
[05:55.33]Yeah.
[05:57.21]I need refugee.
[05:58.47]Okay.
[05:58.87]Yeah.
[05:59.01]So that's.
[06:00.38]Refuge.
[06:01.38]I need refuge, Jerma.
[06:03.32]Are you a lizard?
[06:04.82]I like it hot.
[06:06.22]I like the hot weather.
[06:07.18]I actually enjoy it.
[06:10.83]You two are reptiles.
[06:13.03]Oh, it's going to be heating up in here.
[06:17.18]I hate the heat.
[06:18.90]I want to cry if it's hotter than 85.
[06:21.08]Just start crying.
[06:25.68]The moment it goes from 84 to 85, you just start like, no, this is too much.
[06:28.94]You're sitting there looking at the thermostat like, no, don't, please don't.
[06:32.38]It's like 84.
[06:32.78]No, no, no.
[06:33.32]85.
[06:33.34]But the real feel is 70.
[06:34.14]72 to 73 is perfect, I think.
[06:34.68]Alright, do you want to play the game that you wanted to play or...
[06:46.86]it's funny that you phrased it like that because I feel like this is just not gonna hold your attention and the first thing someone said in my chat was like can't wait for Jerma to get bored of this in 30 minutes so we have two backups but here's the thing hold on yeah I'm ready
[07:12.58]there's the alright I'm ready you saying like you know what on one hand I appreciate you agreeing to play this yeah on the other hand I wish you'd just say shut up that's I don't know I'd rather do something else oh like you said when I invited you to the House Flipper thing on Tuesday I don't know I don't know if I'm gonna be here on Tuesday I mean I'll do it
[07:34.13]Well, no, yeah, you can't.
[07:35.27]But I need to confirm.
[07:36.81]Now I can't.
[07:37.39]Well, I confirmed the list.
[07:39.47]I confirmed the list.
[07:40.31]You couldn't add plus one to the list?
[07:42.51]I could.
[07:43.07]For your best man at your wedding?
[07:47.06]Do you want... I was just messing around, but do you actually have... Do you want to do it?
[07:52.62]I can know by the end of the day if I'll be here on Tuesday or not.
[07:55.00]Okay, you're going to do it, and you're not... Here's what I think you're going to do.
[07:59.63]It's everyone's timed.
[08:01.09]Everyone gets 70 minutes to make a house and I know what you're going to do.
[08:05.17]It's not enough time.
[08:06.01]Trust me.
[08:06.59]I've tested.
[08:08.64]You're going to get in there.
[08:09.46]He's doing full runs to test.
[08:12.18]Oh, I have a whole.
[08:12.76]You're slow.
[08:13.38]You're slow as shit.
[08:14.71]How many times did you like stop to explain something when you were building your house?
[08:18.15]Yeah, but when you're on a timer, you can't do that.
[08:19.96]You gotta go.
[08:20.46]But here's what I think you're gonna do.
[08:21.40]I'm gonna take your joke from you, and I'm gonna ruin it.
[08:23.60]Okay.
[08:23.92]You're gonna show up.
[08:25.60]It's gonna be like, alright, everybody get started, and everyone's gonna be still like, let's go, I'm hype!
[08:28.54]You're gonna make a big deal about how hyped you are about this.
[08:31.56]You are then going to exit House Flipper, and go do something else.
[08:35.46]And then, when your time slot is up, it's just gonna be the default house.
[08:40.26]It's like, you didn't even do anything.
[08:42.21]I'm not gonna lie that was my first idea yeah and it's a good idea like I don't want to agree to do this whole thing for this one joke and it's the most project predictable joke he knows I'm gonna do but then I came up with joke two oh still like it's still just like 60 minutes for one joke I don't know you could if you really want me in this room I mean what is it scored on
[09:06.65]Creativity.
[09:08.05]Complexity.
[09:08.37]I feel like it's going to be really biased because someone told me that you could like import images.
[09:12.24]Yes.
[09:12.88]As your wallpaper.
[09:13.66]So I just feel like whoever does the Jerma memes on the wall is going to win.
[09:16.74]Yeah, but why would I?
[09:19.20]I'm going to be doing it very seriously.
[09:21.46]I'm going to be taking it dead seriously.
[09:23.17]I don't think you can.
[09:24.39]Creativity.
[09:25.61]I don't think you can separate yourself.
[09:26.89]Like once you enter a room and it's like, oh, this is the Otto room.
[09:29.57]And it's like all dog toys and pictures of Otto on the wall.
[09:32.01]That person won.
[09:34.14]So, though they didn't win, they got points for philosophy, because that's one of the categories.
[09:40.23]There's a philosophy category?
[09:41.75]Okay.
[09:41.97]Yeah, there is.
[09:44.27]Creativity, complexity, structural integrity, cleanliness, philosophy, and chat's grid.
[09:52.99]Well, let me ask you this.
[09:55.64]In your own home decor decoration area,
[10:01.43]type strategy, like your own home?
[10:04.01]Yeah.
[10:04.71]What?
[10:05.07]How is your home decorated?
[10:06.23]Do you decorate your home?
[10:07.23]Do you go around like, oh, this painting would look great in my foyer?
[10:09.73]I mean, sometimes, yeah.
[10:12.89]I think when you get like a new place, you kind of look around and you go, Alright, I could see maybe like a painting there and be like, a furniture piece that you do your own design philosophy when you first, I guess when you first move in.
[10:27.37]I don't do this every day.
[10:28.29]I don't walk around and go, I don't walk around my, you know, look at my Reddit shelf and be like, hmm, what should I add?
[10:32.65]I did it.
[10:33.45]I did my decorations.
[10:33.95]Your what shelf?
[10:34.87]My Reddit shelf.
[10:36.17]You have a Reddit shelf.
[10:38.13]It's just, that's like what everybody calls it because they make fun of me for it.
[10:41.70]I have a shelf that has a bunch of like trinkets on it.
[10:45.02]Oh, you like framed photographs of all of your favorite comments from Reddit?
[10:49.24]No, it's all my favorite stream items.
[10:55.21]It's a little like pieces of memorabilia for me to remember.
[10:57.89]Like, oh wait, I remember I did the dollhouse.
[10:59.77]There's like the dollhouse, the 985 sign.
[11:02.39]It's nice to come in and look.
[11:04.25]Yeah, I would be all white walls, no decorations.
[11:08.45]The only reason I have anything on my wall is because the camera points at it.
[11:13.58]It's fair.
[11:15.18]It's like you want me to come in a House Flipper.
[11:18.56]And I'm a minimalist.
[11:19.75]The invite is there.
[11:21.37]If you want to do it, I can get you.
[11:22.61]You just said the invite wasn't there anymore.
[11:24.71]But then you told me you had like... Okay, well, here's the... We got to give the context to everybody listening.
[11:29.92]I reached out.
[11:30.44]I said, hey, Ster.
[11:32.34]Good buddy.
[11:33.22]We've known each other for like 30 years.
[11:35.75]You want to do a house slipper house?
[11:38.54]And your reply was, stop talking to me.
[11:42.90]Which was hurtful.
[11:44.90]And I figured I'd give you a few days.
[11:47.74]And then when I tried again, I said, hey, just checking in again, curious if you want to do that House Flipper thing.
[11:54.39]You sent me a gif of Kermit the Frog drinking the tea.
[11:59.17]And it was like, I don't know.
[12:02.21]It was kind of hurtful.
[12:04.25]Do you know what my favorite gif image is?
[12:06.08]What is it?
[12:07.10]And it relates to this.
[12:09.82]He doesn't know my favorite gif.
[12:11.90]Is he even a real fan?
[12:13.68]Is it Gigachad?
[12:14.82]No.
[12:15.22]It's the orangutan trying to nail the nail into the wood, but he's not actually doing it.
[12:22.60]David Attenborough.
[12:26.09]I know.
[12:26.43]Dude, a tumbleweed just went by.
[12:27.79]We have to, like, press play.
[12:31.09]Alright.
[12:31.69]I mean, you're going to fucking check out everything.
[12:33.91]Am I going to laugh?
[12:34.97]Well, we have a DM open if you want to show it to me.
[12:38.18]I could find it.
[12:41.47]If I laugh, then you don't have to do a House Flipper house.
[12:46.30]If I do laugh, then you do.
[12:48.78]Wait, did I say that wrong?
[12:51.18]Which one is more beneficial to you, me losing or winning?
[12:55.60]I didn't even hear the terms and conditions.
[12:59.89]I just said it and I don't remember either.
[13:02.07]Let's just play.
[13:03.93]While I'm opening, I just got it.
[13:09.59]Jerba, don't laugh.
[13:10.93]Okay, if I laugh at your gif, I can see it, it's over there right now, I'm not gonna look though.
[13:16.65]If I laugh at this, if I genuinely go, okay, that's funny, then you don't have to do a House Flipper house.
[13:22.97]If I do laugh, if I don't laugh, you know what, I'm just gonna look at it.
[13:27.61]Alright, that's funny.
[13:36.15]It's the best thing on the internet.
[13:37.23]It's pretty funny.
[13:38.01]Yeah.
[13:38.49]Yeah.
[13:39.06]That's all good.
[13:39.48]And I love that it kind of looks like it loops and he's just trying, he's been trying for a really long time.
[13:43.54]My favorite part is he's got it in his mouth and he kind of like, he kind of takes it out.
[13:46.40]Okay.
[13:49.15]You ready?
[13:50.93]Uh, I don't know.
[13:52.71]You have any, any more
[13:55.43]Any more zany things to talk about before we play?
[13:57.21]We'll come up with it.
[13:57.83]We're ready.
[13:58.47]Okay.
[13:58.73]Yeah, it'll come up.
[14:01.54]I'm right here.
[14:02.04]I don't know if you can see the screen.
[14:03.36]I'm choosing the destination.
[14:04.54]It's like a roguelike.
[14:05.34]There's 12 floors to the final boss.
[14:07.84]Can you give like a TL;DR for what is going on?
[14:10.34]I haven't played this game before.
[14:12.08]My interpretation is that it's Slay the Spire with friends.
[14:15.41]Slay the Spire, you know, you battle the enemies.
[14:18.77]It's quite clear.
[14:23.16]you not show it on your stream I I just looked over at your channel let me get it okay he doesn't care about the viewer experience I guess how do I even well it's not I don't have this on my computer like you do you do because I sent it to you but I have to save it and like copy it and then put it over here not I mean no really I'm
[14:51.13]You can drag it from Discord into your OBS window.
[14:55.76]I can't.
[14:58.24]It doesn't let me do that.
[15:02.18]Don't make up stuff for views, okay?
[15:04.67]Okay.
[15:19.30]that's it's pretty funny it's okay you don't have to make a house if you don't want to but wait what if I want it to then yeah then I'll give you a time slot okay wait there's time slots I don't think there's like 12 streamers doing this I thought they were all going to be doing it at the same time yeah but then after you have to give me a tour like you can't do it everyone can't do a tour at the exact same time and you have to like schedule an open house yes there are 12 people doing this
[15:47.71]Is the game multiplayer?
[15:48.70]Like you walk, you go to their house?
[15:50.46]No, it's going to be Discord sharing or through their stream.
[15:55.90]You mean there's going to be 13 people?
[15:58.36]Well, it depends.
[15:59.42]There's still one or two.
[16:00.79]Okay, you in the game?
[16:01.97]I've been in the game the whole time.
[16:04.11]We're choosing floor one.
[16:05.39]It gives you an option.
[16:06.61]You encounter skeletons and a smith or a vault.
[16:10.01]I haven't played this either.
[16:11.21]I'm ready.
[16:11.97]Ster, the only reason why people are here is to watch us argue.
[16:14.70]So don't worry.
[16:15.18]I know, I know.
[16:17.23]But I picked the most complicated game to argue over because you're going to have to like read cards and understand things and mechanics when we really should just be like... Doing a food podcast.
[16:27.12]Yeah.
[16:27.84]How do I ready up?
[16:32.28]I don't know.
[16:32.90]I've never played this before.
[16:35.04]Do I have to choose a ready button?
[16:37.20]On each floor, you have a choice between two monsters guarding different locations.
[16:40.47]Each hero makes their own choice.
[16:43.07]Oh.
[16:44.05]Oh, okay.
[16:44.33]Okay.
[16:45.89]Zombie, corpse, or skeleton.
[16:49.21]I chose the left one.
[16:50.41]I think maybe it'll even... I'll pick whatever.
[16:53.76]I'll pick skeleton.
[16:55.02]Okay, it shows what we picked above our characters as well.
[16:57.44]Alright, let's go.
[16:58.42]Yeah!
[16:59.60]Yeah!
[17:00.08]Whoa!
[17:00.86]No cam?
[17:01.98]If you're good, I'll turn this on.
[17:02.70]Do you have a cam on right now?
[17:05.28]I mean, I do.
[17:11.39]Alright, so what do we do?
[17:14.16]You attack cards, drag to the enemy using your mana.
[17:19.07]You've never played Slay the Spire.
[17:20.39]I have, yeah.
[17:21.81]But do we go at the same time?
[17:23.31]Is it turns or is it... We're going to find out.
[17:27.27]Block cards.
[17:28.57]Okay.
[17:29.29]Yeah, that just gives you the armor.
[17:30.82]Yep.
[17:30.90]You can tell what a monster is doing by the things above their head.
[17:34.46]Yep.
[17:34.80]Their intent.
[17:36.06]Okay.
[17:37.56]Intent.
[17:37.98]Yep.
[17:38.62]Just like... I played a little bit of Slay the Spire.
[17:41.28]It was fun.
[17:42.90]Okay, the circle around us represents melee range and rain.
[17:46.90]Okay.
[17:47.48]I'm done.
[17:47.92]I can't.
[17:48.18]I'm done.
[17:48.56]Okay.
[17:48.92]That's it.
[17:49.22]That was it.
[17:49.72]That's it.
[17:50.10]I read it all.
[17:50.52]We're good.
[17:51.74]I think we go simultaneously.
[17:53.08]So where are you?
[17:55.31]I'm on the left.
[17:56.89]Oh, we have like, okay, we have two halves of a screen.
[18:00.55]Yeah.
[18:02.29]And then your manas, you got three mana, I assume, at the bottom.
[18:05.81]I do.
[18:06.63]So I'm going to attack this.
[18:08.81]Should I attack people on your side?
[18:09.85]Should we just go with the same person?
[18:11.36]Can you attack the zombie?
[18:14.56]Yeah, I just did.
[18:16.12]Okay.
[18:16.30]Can you kill that guy?
[18:17.77]Yeah.
[18:18.53]And then I'm the ranger.
[18:20.97]Then I have one mana.
[18:22.11]This is kind of cool, actually.
[18:23.29]Alright.
[18:23.51]So I have two block now, and now we end turn.
[18:28.45]This is kind of cool.
[18:32.61]And then they come get us.
[18:33.75]So when they're in the circle here, I imagine that.
[18:37.57]Okay.
[18:39.51]It said when they're in the circle, they count as being in melee range.
[18:42.96]Oh, okay.
[18:43.26]Special heart icons to read their tooltips.
[18:48.50]Special features.
[18:52.46]Attacks only from near range.
[18:54.04]Okay.
[18:55.92]I see I picked the game with reading, man.
[18:58.41]I can read.
[18:59.79]I just did sorcery.
[19:00.77]When are you going to play sorcery?
[19:01.75]Are you ever going to do that?
[19:02.79]I played sorcery one.
[19:04.39]On stream?
[19:05.27]On stream?
[19:06.69]No, it's it's I'm telling you your chats going to love it.
[19:10.21]Just going to love it if you do.
[19:12.36]But every time I play a game like that, my chats like you.
[19:14.40]Why do you just play every game?
[19:15.28]Jerma plays.
[19:17.86]Stop saying that to him.
[19:20.90]Stop saying that to him.
[19:22.34]Stop, you're hurting my feelings.
[19:23.98]Stop saying that.
[19:25.29]It's a great game.
[19:26.51]They said if you play sorcery, we're done with you.
[19:30.39]There's a better playthrough on the Internet.
[19:34.55]It's not true.
[19:35.09]Alright, so mighty blow.
[19:39.18]Deal two damage in a medium radius.
[19:40.62]Random monster in a radius is dealt.
[19:41.88]Oh, okay.
[19:42.36]So this will hurt.
[19:44.00]See these two people.
[19:44.76]Okay.
[19:47.66]I should probably block.
[19:49.30]Right?
[19:49.82]With the mana.
[19:50.44]Because I'm going to be the one taking all these hits.
[19:52.38]You're taking a lot of hits.
[19:53.54]You're taking a... Oh, you're good.
[19:54.88]You were taking a minus three.
[19:55.94]Okay.
[19:59.53]Fantastic.
[20:01.26]We're in the tutorial level.
[20:02.94]I think we got this.
[20:03.62]Do I have a max amount of shield I can have?
[20:05.12]Because I probably should just... What the hell just happened?
[20:10.35]I just did two shield blocks and it took me down to one shield.
[20:13.55]Oh, that's mana.
[20:14.45]Oops.
[20:14.65]Alright, so that's one.
[20:18.87]Whoops.
[20:20.17]We're good.
[20:23.36]Okay.
[20:26.16]Are you going to hit them ever?
[20:27.86]I mean, I could try hitting them, but...
[20:30.77]Seems like that's something that's on your agenda.
[20:34.25]Well, your armor doesn't carry over to the next turn.
[20:36.81]So you had six armor and they did like two damage to you.
[20:40.36]That's math.
[20:40.84]That's just simple math.
[20:42.48]Nice horse hair.
[20:43.62]Are you turned on your webcam to compete with me?
[20:48.90]Yes.
[20:50.88]Nice.
[20:51.84]What kind of hair do you have?
[20:56.08]What?
[20:56.26]I'm going to swing.
[20:58.19]What kind of hair?
[21:01.25]Alright, my side's clear, yours isn't.
[21:05.74]My side's clear.
[21:09.82]Easy.
[21:10.72]No jokes.
[21:11.28]This is actually pretty cool.
[21:12.40]This is like a cool concept.
[21:15.34]No jokes.
[21:16.26]That's why we're playing it.
[21:18.30]Do we share this or is this for each of us?
[21:20.74]I believe it's for each of us.
[21:21.66]It's offering me rogue cards and you're getting warrior cards.
[21:24.91]I thought you were going to be the wizard, to be honest.
[21:28.80]I feel like we needed a shield guy.
[21:35.17]I took some AOE.
[21:37.13]And I don't know what this gem is.
[21:38.87]What does stamina can be added or subtracted by special card?
[21:41.53]What does stamina do?
[21:43.39]Is that just like... What is stamina?
[21:46.75]I'm going to... I don't know.
[21:50.33]I feel like this is going to be hard to use.
[21:52.47]I'll get the short sword.
[21:55.65]Stamina is mana.
[21:56.57]Okay.
[21:58.68]Nice Nosferatu hair.
[22:00.06]Yeah, that's fine.
[22:03.89]Why does everyone all of a sudden think you're a vampire?
[22:08.87]Because
[22:10.89]We made like a little jokey reference.
[22:12.73]Somebody made a picture of me with like how to face it in like a full Dracula costume.
[22:19.03]And then I said I would do it on Halloween.
[22:21.15]I would do that exact outfit.
[22:23.39]And you didn't do it.
[22:26.93]Well, it's not Halloween yet.
[22:28.03]Halloween is October.
[22:31.97]I guess I don't have enough money.
[22:34.63]vault oops okay those look kind of grayed out oh yeah wait what are you picking any of these uh yeah so you get gems I got four gems scoop is giving you like I don't know if we would choose I don't know if we have like the same choices yeah how come there's okay refine oh okay I'm gonna create a random card
[23:01.53]shield block it's going to turn into oh this is good for both of them each that's good for both of us that gives you a shield as well I'll be support okay get a random artifact of any rarity let's try that heal three HP after each battle you survive that's pretty good maybe we shouldn't spend all of our money
[23:31.37]Yeah, I only spent one.
[23:32.71]Not all of them cost money.
[23:39.87]Cool.
[23:43.58]Okay.
[23:44.52]And then we go down to the next floor.
[23:46.78]I get it.
[23:47.08]That's fun.
[23:47.52]What did you get for eight max HP?
[23:49.94]That's pretty good.
[23:52.01]You should think about a new haircut.
[23:53.45]Well, I was in the middle of growing out every single like piece of hair.
[23:57.65]Uh, it got pretty long up here.
[24:00.28]It was, I had a really big beard, but no, it was unbearable in the heat.
[24:06.40]It was like 115 at one point in Vegas here last week, I want to say.
[24:10.35]And I just, it just like, it had to go.
[24:13.69]It was un-fucking-bearable.
[24:18.62]skeletons weren't that bad you've been in Vegas too long you're doing like some elvis shit what what is this what is what you've seen street you played Street Fighter yeah right what are you talking about you just really got inspired by marissa you thought like oh that hairstyle looks sick I can pull that off I don't even know what you're describing what are you talking about
[24:44.35]You ready to go on the next floor?
[24:45.49]I've had this hair for... I used to do E3 presentations with this hair.
[24:51.17]You did E3 presentations?
[24:52.71]Yes, for a long time.
[24:54.43]Not officially.
[24:56.86]Not officially speaking, but, you know, I would... Everybody... I do this all the time.
[25:02.50]Oh, yeah, I was presenting for my game company that I was a part of.
[25:07.84]Oh, yeah, I remember.
[25:09.46]I remember.
[25:09.80]I remember.
[25:14.57]We keep teaching us new things.
[25:19.27]They work over time, okay?
[25:22.80]Cooperation is key.
[25:23.88]Click on your teammate's avatar to see their deck and map.
[25:26.46]Okay.
[25:28.96]Right-click on a spot on the floor to get... Okay, well, we're in a call, so we can just tell each other.
[25:33.24]That's all irrelevant to me.
[25:37.59]I think we actually have to start doing strategy, though.
[25:40.27]That pop-up was, hey, you know how to play the game.
[25:43.84]Now you need to communicate.
[25:45.24]So how do you want to do this?
[25:47.68]I don't understand.
[25:48.40]What was the buff thing that they were talking about?
[25:52.46]Yeah, they went away.
[25:53.44]The influences.
[25:57.83]I'm going to give us four block.
[26:00.41]I think that's a good use of our time here.
[26:03.79]And then I'm going to deal...
[26:08.44]This is going to be three, four.
[26:09.72]I'm good.
[26:10.30]I can take all these hits.
[26:12.48]And I'm going to do a... I'm going to hit these... This guy right here.
[26:18.82]Actually, I'm going to hit the archer.
[26:20.68]That's weird that sometimes when I shoot enemies out of my... Out of the... Like far away this zombie and I don't kill them, they return one damage to me.
[26:30.67]Like it's like Slay the Spy.
[26:31.61]Like, you know, you hit the thing, but it feels weird when you're a ranged character and they're that far away and he's a zombie.
[26:36.03]And I can clearly see that he's a zombie.
[26:40.09]Uh, was it a ranged zombie?
[26:41.39]Like a zombie mage or something?
[26:43.19]No, it's like when you hit something, they hit you back.
[26:45.76]Oh, it's like the boom.
[26:46.78]You both did damage.
[26:47.60]OK, I see.
[26:48.28]Yeah, the hearthstone cards bumping.
[26:50.12]Yep.
[26:53.50]OK.
[26:54.12]Uh, it throws a bone at me.
[26:56.34]This monster is buffed.
[26:57.87]He's got five damage.
[26:59.41]This is going to hurt a lot.
[27:00.57]So I'm about to take ten damage if you don't help me.
[27:04.23]I'm shooting him.
[27:04.87]Thank God.
[27:07.95]You're about to take five still.
[27:10.25]Well, not necessarily true.
[27:12.33]Wait, wait.
[27:13.10]Oops.
[27:16.42]Couldn't you block me?
[27:18.38]It doesn't matter.
[27:19.10]I can block you, yes.
[27:21.10]And then I can kill this guy.
[27:24.22]I'm still going to take one damage though.
[27:28.28]Oh, because those long range guys are shooting you.
[27:32.25]What is shakedown?
[27:34.38]Did you just do that?
[27:36.10]Yes.
[27:36.78]Oh, that's what you were playing.
[27:38.06]That spins my gems?
[27:45.18]Yeah, better be grateful.
[27:48.67]Wait, how do I... I can't use my blocks on you.
[27:51.47]That's a you thing.
[27:53.17]You can't do it to me?
[27:53.73]I'm getting kind of hurt here.
[28:00.69]Alright, you...
[28:03.49]You're okay.
[28:06.75]They all want to kill you.
[28:07.65]I think I'm the tank, right?
[28:11.33]I'm going to give us this.
[28:11.85]Think of yourself like a tank.
[28:13.59]Let's do that.
[28:17.03]I deal more damage to things when they're outside the circles.
[28:20.35]So when they're all coming in this circle, I start to become pretty useless.
[28:25.18]So I can kill the ranged guy, I guess.
[28:28.04]I can kill the guy right next to me.
[28:32.42]And then you're kind of on your own.
[28:33.73]Yeah, we're good.
[28:34.25]Now we're good.
[28:35.81]Didn't take any damage.
[28:39.89]I had your stream muted for like two minutes and I didn't even realize it.
[28:45.08]You were probably busy with something.
[28:46.84]You probably had something else going on.
[28:52.87]I can kill this guy.
[28:56.11]And then I'm going to give you some block.
[28:59.93]And then I'm going to swing my sword at this one.
[29:04.38]Okay, I didn't spend the gems.
[29:05.70]It just isn't showing the gems on the UI yet.
[29:08.32]Or while we're in combat.
[29:10.96]You asked her if you had a good breakfast.
[29:12.34]Did you have a good breakfast?
[29:14.38]Um... Did I?
[29:16.70]Did I?
[29:18.94]What'd you have?
[29:20.68]Let's compare breakfasts.
[29:22.02]How's that sound?
[29:23.10]I think today I had a...
[29:27.04]what did I have I had a I just had a sandwich just like a two slices of bread you put meat and cheese in between it what was just what was the meat uh ham salami monster cheese sandwich okay that's like that's I I would eat that okay but you're you're about to like
[29:51.99]embarrass me with this incredible no breakfast you had I had um I drank a full serving of kefir which is like a yogurt drink and then I had some greens what I don't know when I say it like that it sounds like I am kind of trying to be better than you
[30:13.80]It was the inflection of the green and some greens because like you didn't say you had green.
[30:17.88]So I was like trying to make it seem like I was like way better than you at breakfast.
[30:21.61]I didn't.
[30:22.13]I did not have a balanced breakfast.
[30:24.09]I normally wouldn't have that for breakfast.
[30:26.01]And I'm kind of embarrassed that you're putting me on the spot.
[30:33.12]What a health nut.
[30:38.08]I'm really not.
[30:42.03]Hold on, is this just gambling?
[30:44.01]You have a 50% chance to find three gems.
[30:47.77]Well, I lost.
[30:48.39]I got him.
[30:54.73]I'm doing the gem build.
[30:57.23]There's a lot of rogue gem cards.
[31:00.65]Okay, I can exchange this.
[31:05.31]Heal damage equal to your block.
[31:07.43]Hmm, I don't like that.
[31:09.63]Get a boomerang shield?
[31:15.12]I mean, why not?
[31:15.70]It's free.
[31:17.60]Free.
[31:18.92]And then I'll do this.
[31:20.32]And I lost again.
[31:24.04]You're poor.
[31:25.46]That was like 50-50, two 50-50s.
[31:28.24]Losing them both.
[31:33.91]You will encounter Templar.
[31:37.33]So this is, we can upgrade our cards.
[31:41.04]Alright, so these mean very important things.
[31:43.24]Yeah.
[31:44.60]The type of enemy you fight and the reward.
[31:48.30]What do you have on yours?
[31:49.90]We choose our own.
[31:51.00]And then the end where it shows the three options I think are based on what we chose.
[31:55.53]Okay, well I made it hard because a Templar is going to fight us.
[31:59.71]Okay, well how do you know a Templar is hard?
[32:03.09]Templars are usually weak because when they go to swing at you, they go, wait, would God want this?
[32:07.41]And they hesitate.
[32:10.49]That looks like a hard enemy.
[32:11.99]That's 15 health.
[32:14.49]I got a card.
[32:15.21]I got a trump card for that guy.
[32:16.81]Okay.
[32:19.95]So right now I'm going to shield block you.
[32:23.37]Let me shield block you first if you're going to take damage because you'll hurt yourself.
[32:26.48]I don't know why I did literally nothing.
[32:30.40]Okay.
[32:31.34]I'm going to do mighty blow.
[32:39.45]What is this new thing here?
[32:43.15]What is that above the imp?
[32:45.21]Block?
[32:45.91]Okay, gains three block.
[32:50.67]Terma, fix your sideburns.
[32:53.55]Yeah, they're probably all messed up right now.
[32:54.76]It's fine, though.
[32:55.22]I don't care.
[32:55.48]You have to ignite bombs?
[33:06.94]Alright, well, I'm in a little bit of trouble here.
[33:13.84]oh oh you see okay I put a bomb out there you see the bomb on the right this thing here yeah and I have to ignite it and then kill the other templar I bombed him you're in danger there pal
[33:31.65]To the first monster.
[33:32.73]I could kill the one here.
[33:34.19]I could do... Okay, I could do four damage to the Templar.
[33:36.87]I got it.
[33:39.29]I'll just... Okay, I can't kill this Imp.
[33:41.80]But I could kill the... Yeah, I'm going to kill this guy.
[33:45.24]And then I will just do a... This one here.
[33:52.22]Oh, not in the circle?
[33:53.15]I thought he was in the circle.
[33:56.73]I think when they're on the line, that's considered mid-range.
[33:59.37]Mm-hmm.
[34:05.51]Can you remove this charm that you put on me?
[34:08.60]Just go eat a banana.
[34:09.26]You'll be alright.
[34:11.46]That does fix it usually.
[34:13.52]Uh, I'm gonna... I'm just gonna attack this person right next to you.
[34:23.49]Thank you.
[34:27.35]What'd you do?
[34:28.85]I kicked him away.
[34:31.35]We don't got to kill him this turn.
[34:33.17]Oh, you had lethal.
[34:33.97]You had lethal.
[34:34.99]Did I?
[34:35.79]Did I actually have lethal?
[34:38.67]I can't see your cards.
[34:42.71]Why do you have two webcams?
[34:49.32]Do you?
[34:49.82]You should get like five of all different angles of your head.
[34:53.12]Did I ever tell you about the stream that I really wanted to do?
[34:55.83]And it was I wanted to get like 30 webcams.
[35:00.55]and have them all set for different timings and stuff and have them delayed at different times so I could, like, yell at myself and fight myself and stuff.
[35:06.37]Fucking ego Andy.
[35:11.74]Well, I... I talked to... I talked to Jake about it.
[35:16.58]Community Jake.
[35:18.52]And he was just like... I don't think what you want to do is physically fucking possible.
[35:23.80]I was like, okay.
[35:25.18]I was like, alright.
[35:26.12]How do you fight yourself on a camera?
[35:28.54]I was like, whatever.
[35:30.66]If it's not gonna work, it's not gonna work.
[35:35.18]Uh... Okay, here.
[35:43.32]There's also, it was, it was, this was, like, kind of, COVID was still, kind of, COVID was, like, people were, lockdown was happening, and I didn't want to, because, like, webcams, people were doing a bunch of Zoom calls and needing to buy webcams, and I didn't want to be the guy that, like, wiped out the fucking webcam supply during COVID by buying, like, 40 of them.
[36:02.18]It was like, uh, I don't think I want to do that.
[36:04.58]I think that's probably, like, not a good idea.
[36:09.68]I could understand that argument if you went to the grocery store and, like, bought all of the food.
[36:14.81]But you're talking about webcams.
[36:17.23]Yeah, but there was, I feel like there was, like, a weird price surge with webcams.
[36:21.05]And it was like, oh, they're, like, very expensive now because people are buying them.
[36:24.21]A ton of people are buying them.
[36:26.04]And I was like, I don't, I want to be the guy that has, like, a, I don't know.
[36:29.80]I don't know if I want to do it.
[36:32.79]I got like test ones at one point.
[36:36.29]At some point later, I got, I want to say like six and I tried to hook them all up and it was like, this is fucking impossible.
[36:43.51]And it just made me frustrated and I just canned the whole thing.
[36:45.89]Okay.
[36:56.29]Just delay the single webcam 30 times.
[36:59.92]There is some weird reason why I couldn't do that.
[37:03.78]I forget what it was.
[37:06.38]But I thought of that.
[37:08.32]You can barely use one webcam.
[37:09.70]Yeah, it was a USB thing, right?
[37:12.33]Yeah, it was like the amount of USB bus slots that are on a motherboard.
[37:16.57]Like it couldn't do it or something.
[37:17.89]You can get a...
[37:20.51]Like a USB extension.
[37:22.11]Yeah, but I think it still uses the same bus lane.
[37:25.41]I really think so.
[37:26.49]I looked into this and I was like, well, fuck, I can't do this.
[37:28.78]I have a... I forget what you call them.
[37:31.90]Like a graphics card.
[37:32.66]You plug it into that slot and it has USBs on it.
[37:35.40]I have one of those.
[37:38.42]Like, why couldn't you do that?
[37:40.34]I wouldn't... Voltage?
[37:41.52]It was something.
[37:42.90]And I think the only way... I would have needed to have like four motherboards.
[37:46.32]And it's just like, this is...
[37:49.03]This, this is turning into like a, like a science YouTube video that I'm not making.
[37:53.13]And I'm not, I don't know.
[37:55.23]I don't think so.
[37:56.18]So you, so you gave up.
[37:58.24]I did.
[37:58.50]Yeah.
[37:58.96]Some ideas, you just kind of move on.
[38:01.94]Okay.
[38:02.06]No.
[38:02.68]Yeah, that's true.
[38:03.50]Alright.
[38:05.30]I'm going to refine.
[38:08.59]Ooh, this one's good.
[38:13.51]Haymaker.
[38:21.40]Alright, haymaker or maim?
[38:25.87]Oh, I love my maims.
[38:29.77]I'm doing haymaker.
[38:37.40]And then I'm going to do... So I get both of these.
[38:49.24]Oh, I like that.
[38:49.80]Wait, what does Strain do?
[38:50.98]Is that like, you can't, uh, you lose, you lose... Why?
[38:53.54]Spend your money!
[38:54.06]No!
[38:56.24]My build gains strength from how many gems I have.
[39:01.02]Fire Imp or Temp Heart?
[39:02.62]My build, Jerma!
[39:05.08]Do you want removal on the next, um, rest period, or do you want, um, new cards?
[39:13.90]New cards.
[39:14.66]I want to see the new cards.
[39:15.84]Okay.
[39:17.16]Let's see what's out there in the big wide world.
[39:19.62]Just buy 40 pieces.
[39:24.77]I agree with that.
[39:27.69]I know.
[39:31.33]This one looks hard.
[39:34.39]Yeah.
[39:34.77]You ever seen a snail dude?
[39:35.84]Yeah.
[39:40.14]So when these firearms fly into the near range, they explode when they die.
[39:45.22]So you got to watch out for that.
[39:46.58]I heard us with it last round.
[39:47.68]I didn't know.
[39:48.16]I'm going to give this to you.
[39:53.72]And then I'm going to slash at this one.
[40:01.89]I'm going to slash this one.
[40:04.63]Yeah.
[40:04.99]Wait, should we kill this thing that's in here?
[40:08.26]At the top.
[40:09.00]This thing right here.
[40:10.82]Do you have one damage?
[40:13.64]Not in close range.
[40:14.78]No.
[40:15.36]Oops.
[40:17.74]Well.
[40:20.38]I killed it.
[40:21.82]Didn't have to.
[40:22.28]Oh, that was weird.
[40:24.28]You look like Anakin from episode three.
[40:34.45]That sounds like a compliment.
[40:35.85]Anakin is one of the most powerful Jedis to have ever existed.
[40:38.77]Cool.
[40:46.34]Well, how come every time I take that test, I get Yoda?
[40:50.82]Which is also amazing, by the way.
[40:56.73]Yoda's pretty sick.
[40:59.27]Alright.
[40:59.55]Yoda's kind of cute.
[41:01.27]Five damage.
[41:03.81]Does anybody have block on right now?
[41:06.89]No, I can't really do anything this round.
[41:09.11]You want me just to... Here.
[41:10.33]Here.
[41:19.01]It's hard out here.
[41:22.72]Can I hit everybody with this?
[41:25.02]I thought it could only hit two people.
[41:26.70]That's amazing.
[41:27.52]OK, well, I almost just cleared my whole side.
[41:29.16]Do you have a favorite Star Wars character?
[41:35.59]I don't know.
[41:40.41]The big one?
[41:42.41]Jabba?
[41:44.08]Jabba the Hutt is your favorite Star Wars character?
[41:47.57]I'm not... I don't know too much about Star Wars, but I know he's cool.
[41:51.41]Mine's Luke.
[41:56.43]Lame.
[41:57.51]If your answer of your favorite Star Wars character is, like, the protagonist... Lame.
[42:05.10]Luke is actually really cool, though.
[42:08.02]It's not Luke, but I would say Luke is cool.
[42:13.92]That's a bad take.
[42:14.78]Yeah, that's a pretty shit take, sir.
[42:16.14]I don't know.
[42:21.77]Why?
[42:22.11]Because, okay, what if the main character of a show is really, really awesome?
[42:28.02]Like, really cool, and like, wow, what a great character.
[42:30.78]Alright, let me ask you this.
[42:33.90]Have you ever played Red Dead Redemption 2?
[42:36.68]No.
[42:39.55]What?
[42:41.59]Okay, I played half of the tutorial, and I was like, I don't think I really want to do this.
[42:45.75]What?
[42:46.67]No way.
[42:48.07]You've never really...
[42:50.90]Wow, okay.
[42:52.10]Did you play GTA 5 all the way through?
[42:55.34]You did, didn't you?
[42:56.38]No, I got to that mission where you had to start loading cargo at the shipyard.
[43:01.94]And I was like, this isn't what I signed up for.
[43:06.63]I kind of lost interest in the story.
[43:08.15]Oh, I just exploded that.
[43:09.05]Yeah, you got any armor for me?
[43:11.51]I did.
[43:11.97]I got rid of it.
[43:16.39]um well anyways my point was going to be that Arthur Morgan is the main character and I think Arthur Morgan is probably one of the coolest characters in that whole game like is that is that wrong which one's Arthur Morgan dutch ah I can't do it oh and Red Dead Redemption yeah what are you talking that was not a great impression but yeah but we're talking about Star Wars
[43:44.40]Yeah, but I'm saying, but you said the main character, thinking the main character is the best character in the series is lame, is what you said.
[43:52.80]Arthur Morgan is not lame, and I think he's the best character in that game.
[43:55.42]No, no, no, no.
[43:56.93]I'm talking about Star Wars.
[43:59.11]I'm not talking about in general.
[44:00.55]All main characters are bad.
[44:03.03]Okay, everybody settle down.
[44:04.89]But like when you're talking about Disney, Star Wars, like I want to be the protag Luke.
[44:08.89]He's so strong.
[44:09.85]They have like no personality.
[44:13.48]Your favorite character is Luke.
[44:16.43]When there's characters like Jabba the Hutt.
[44:20.03]All of the side characters in Star Wars are cooler than the main protags because they're not human.
[44:25.41]It's always the default anime protag human.
[44:29.29]Male, white male with the hair.
[44:33.89]I did not know you were this strongly for... I thought you meant all... I thought you meant all fucking media.
[44:44.60]Dude, any show I've ever seen the main character, so boring.
[44:49.26]That's what I thought.
[44:49.76]You're like, oh, main character.
[44:50.96]I don't like that.
[44:51.62]I like the weird side character that was in two episodes.
[44:55.62]Which is still cool.
[44:56.76]I have a lot of favorites that are like that.
[45:03.60]They're the blank slate that you inject yourself into.
[45:08.56]And you love that guy, don't you?
[45:11.28]Well, hold on to this thing.
[45:12.38]I think silent protagonist, yes.
[45:16.74]I think a silent protagonist, you're imprinting yourself on a silent protagonist.
[45:21.10]I think that a protagonist has a... Doesn't Luke kiss his sister?
[45:26.20]I don't know.
[45:26.78]Maybe?
[45:27.06]I don't know.
[45:27.58]Yeah, no.
[45:28.68]Doesn't he lose points for that?
[45:31.68]I was ironically saying Luke.
[45:33.74]I don't think Luke is the coolest character in the franchise.
[45:37.00]Now it's ironic.
[45:38.09]Oh, I was pulling back.
[45:38.83]I was just being ironic.
[45:41.29]General Grievous is my favorite character in all of Star Wars, okay?
[45:44.97]If you want me to give it to you.
[45:47.99]I do want you to give it to me.
[45:54.80]Did you pick a card yet?
[45:56.32]I'm confused.
[45:57.88]Sure, I picked a card.
[46:01.35]General General Grievous there it is.
[46:03.35]I think I've told this story to you and multiple times before that when I was a child in the first grade Star Wars was really cool I'd never seen any of them but I knew it was cool.
[46:11.24]And when I was out shopping with my mom I saw a t-shirt with one of the droids on it because that movie had just come out and I was like I want that so I can fit in.
[46:17.24]And that's all I know about the clone war bot movies.
[46:22.24]Okay. That's kind of cool though.
[46:24.24]I don't know anything about General Grievous. I just know that he's got four lightsabers and he still can't beat a guy with one.
[46:33.57]I'm about to get really heated.
[46:37.11]At that point in episode three, General Grievous was already very injured.
[46:41.52]Not only that, he was injured previously before the events that happened in the prequels.
[46:46.70]Very seriously injured.
[46:47.83]Okay, hold on.
[46:53.11]I gotta settle down.
[46:55.49]He literally wasn't.
[47:00.25]You don't know the lore.
[47:00.85]I wish I could debate you more, but I actually haven't seen it.
[47:03.67]You just don't know the lore.
[47:04.57]That's okay.
[47:12.19]Oh, you're grayed out.
[47:17.13]You're a Star Wars nerd.
[47:19.61]I'm not really.
[47:20.32]I haven't seen any of the newer things.
[47:25.96]Why not?
[47:27.12]I don't know, because it's just too much of it.
[47:31.62]It's like, it's, there's just too much.
[47:33.60]It's too much.
[47:34.68]I don't, I don't, I don't want, I don't, there's too many things to watch.
[47:37.87]It's just like, I, it's like, oh, the Mandalorian.
[47:40.87]Oh, Mandalorian.
[47:41.47]And then we got like all this other, like the Obi-Wan stuff.
[47:43.73]And then there's, they're making like another movie.
[47:45.47]They're making like another TV show.
[47:46.71]And then it's kind of like the Marvel stuff for me.
[47:49.42]It's like, there's just too much of it.
[47:50.94]It's just, I don't even, it's like, I don't.
[47:53.30]Yeah.
[47:53.64]Yeah.
[47:53.94]You know what?
[47:54.32]I agree.
[47:54.72]I would much prefer if they made a Dune movie and it was like one third of the first book.
[47:59.87]And nothing really happens.
[48:01.87]I made this joke like a year or two ago, but I was going to say, like, I can't, like, let me just say it out loud because it's very good, I think.
[48:09.58]I made a tweet that I didn't tweet.
[48:10.82]It's saved in drafts.
[48:12.04]So, you know, take that as you will.
[48:14.36]It said, I can't wait for phase six of the Marvel Cinematic Universe when it's a baking competition between Wolverine, Cyclops, and Professor X. Like, reality show.
[48:27.67]That's pretty good.
[48:29.03]What?
[48:29.17]What?
[48:31.48]Wait, where did... I missed a few sentences there.
[48:34.72]How did we jump from... What?
[48:37.88]I don't think you were paying attention to what I was saying, but it's okay.
[48:40.64]Okay, no, I wasn't.
[48:41.44]I was thinking about Dune.
[48:45.74]Wait, there's a TV series?
[48:48.22]You ready?
[48:48.74]We're at a boss fight, I think.
[48:50.64]Not yet.
[48:51.82]We're fighting the Whopper from the Big Mac.
[48:54.40]We're fighting the Whopper?
[48:56.02]Yeah.
[48:58.59]I don't think we're there yet.
[48:59.57]We have another floor.
[49:00.31]Alright, how about the wild hog?
[49:02.23]That sounds good.
[49:04.99]We're going to eat a BLT soon.
[49:11.24]Kill curse ghost.
[49:17.02]That's a lot.
[49:19.17]That is a lot.
[49:20.47]What do these do?
[49:23.27]attacks only from near range heals itself at the beginning of monster's turn and it's rotten so you have to kill these things so they hurt you okay the big skeleton the whopper this is the whopper alright spawns a skeleton every time it receives damage so don't just go tickling him oh I got a lot of skeletons I thought you were just saying the whopper this is the actual name of the character is the whopper
[49:49.53]I went to McDonald's.
[49:50.79]I went to McDonald's.
[49:51.53]This is important.
[49:52.90]I went to McDonald's and I was so confident, like, oh, yeah, McDonald's.
[49:58.90]And I turned to the speaker and I'm like, hey, how are you?
[50:02.76]How are you doing today?
[50:03.54]Having a good day?
[50:04.80]I'll take one Grimace meal, please.
[50:06.74]The guy's like, dude, that's over.
[50:10.44]It's not happening anymore.
[50:12.68]And I was like, and I said, oh, fuck, I missed Grimace's birthday.
[50:16.16]And I think he heard me.
[50:21.25]I didn't drink the fucking shake.
[50:23.75]I don't even know what it tastes like.
[50:24.97]I've tried to get it, but I was too late.
[50:27.15]I said, oh fuck, I missed Grimace's birthday.
[50:31.49]Alright, we're killing the Whopper.
[50:34.68]I stunned the Whopper.
[50:37.28]So what do you want me to do?
[50:41.60]I'm gonna kill this guy right here.
[50:47.10]I mean, I did a lot.
[50:49.97]I'm done.
[50:50.31]I just took out three Flying Hogs and end turn.
[50:56.56]Oh, I had a funny idea too.
[50:57.54]You know how everyone drinks the Grimace Shake and like, oh my god, I died because I drank the shake or whatever that trend is?
[51:02.08]Yeah.
[51:05.17]I was gonna take a sip out of the Grimace Shake on camera.
[51:08.56]No way.
[51:09.20]Yep.
[51:09.58]And then... That's crazy.
[51:11.44]Stop it.
[51:12.36]And then after I took a sip out of it, it was gonna cut to me, like, lifting weights really well.
[51:18.10]It was gonna cut to me, like, relaxing on a couch.
[51:21.18]It was gonna cut to, like... I was gonna do... A lot of great things were gonna happen to me.
[51:25.70]I was gonna be like, wow, everything's, like, wonderful today.
[51:27.64]I feel, like, great.
[51:28.84]Everything feels, like, amazing.
[51:30.06]But I was like, mm, that's... Nah.
[51:33.56]I thought it was alright for a second.
[51:35.46]I mean, I would like that if also amongst those things, it was like you making out with someone in a grimace costume.
[51:47.13]Lifted weights.
[51:48.55]Everything's going so well.
[51:50.67]Yeah.
[51:51.59]Oh, that's like, I don't know what's wrong with everyone else.
[51:53.43]Like grimace gets me.
[52:00.29]Grimace gets me.
[52:02.63]Oh, that's fucking funny.
[52:07.80]I was gonna get, like, eight full hours of sleep.
[52:12.14]But, like, during that trend, how expensive a Grimace costume must be.
[52:16.17]Yeah, you want to talk about buying the webcams during when, like, buying 40 webcams?
[52:20.53]How expensive was a fucking Grimace costume?
[52:23.61]They got wiped out.
[52:25.01]They were off of every shelf.
[52:26.57]Well, no, I haven't seen a Grimace costume in any of those.
[52:29.41]Maybe it wasn't effective.
[52:30.63]You have to, you know, and it's got to get delivered.
[52:32.64]Then Grimace's birthday is over.
[52:34.10]How long does this guy's birthday last?
[52:36.49]It was, I think, the whole month of June.
[52:39.87]Was it all of June?
[52:40.81]Or was it, like, just two weeks into it?
[52:42.07]How long was it?
[52:42.57]Oh, yeah.
[52:42.95]My birthday is June.
[52:46.11]Hey, my whole birthday is an entire month.
[52:48.87]You better give me presents every day.
[52:51.23]It was a painful birth.
[52:54.17]Oh, my God.
[52:59.40]Oh, my God.
[53:06.20]he's a big guy oh my god are you done with your turn dude you can't you can't drop a nuke like that and they don't expect me to take a minute alright what do we need I don't know how about uh how about just a block that sounds good that sounds good to me hey you want some car draw
[53:32.43]I'm done with my turn.
[53:34.33]I needed that card a while ago.
[53:36.19]Did you?
[53:36.97]Well, you need to communicate.
[53:38.19]I think we're going to lose.
[53:50.08]Wait, don't do anything yet.
[53:52.73]Did you get a good card?
[53:56.31]Mildly.
[53:59.69]Ooh, wait.
[54:00.19]Okay, deal five additional damage if the monster has block.
[54:03.96]Does the Whopper have block?
[54:07.22]Not yet.
[54:10.60]What did you just do?
[54:11.10]I got him.
[54:12.36]I got him.
[54:12.98]Holy shit, that was pretty cool.
[54:14.40]Alright, well, I'll kill this guy now.
[54:15.64]No, I won't.
[54:16.18]You just took all my mana.
[54:18.93]Did I?
[54:20.31]I took your mana?
[54:22.39]I don't know.
[54:25.87]Just go pull up my stream and rewind the VOD so you can see what you did.
[54:39.64]definitely have had this conversation before but uh I can just kill that guy up there I'm gonna wait till the whopper has okay so I can kill a wounded monster with 10 or less HP should we just get wait until the whopper is 10. um dude I I think we're totally fine I don't think it really matters
[55:20.63]thought they haven't said anything in literally 30 seconds time to leave that's what I do I'm just gonna keep kicking them yeah just keep pushing them back alright I mean I should have waited till I did that I didn't take any damage I got 12 armor
[55:49.34]Every time I play an arrow, I get four block.
[55:51.26]Is this game fun?
[55:52.78]Yeah.
[55:53.24]Actually, it's pretty fun.
[55:56.44]I like it.
[55:56.78]Do you like it?
[55:58.31]I like it so far.
[56:08.31]We got the whopper.
[56:09.51]I was going to sing the Burger King song thing, but no.
[56:15.56]No, I'm not doing that.
[56:18.70]It's like
[56:21.62]That would be like dumb.
[56:23.98]That would be very silly.
[56:25.30]Yeah, it would be.
[56:26.16]Can you kill him?
[56:34.17]That's like wow keyboard turned.
[56:36.03]I just like want this because I just think of the OK.
[56:51.67]Gain one stamina for every eighth damage you deal.
[56:54.45]Gain two stamina if the monster's attack leaves you with block.
[57:02.25]Okay.
[57:03.75]So if I have too much block, I'll take the taunt.
[57:09.36]That sounds fine.
[57:11.94]You have nine money.
[57:14.50]Yeah.
[57:14.66]What do you want me to do with it?
[57:16.44]You just have a lot.
[57:20.51]I also have like 18 more health than you.
[57:22.44]What are you doing?
[57:28.50]All heroes get two block at the start of each turn in the next battle.
[57:31.17]That sounds pretty... This is a boss coming up.
[57:33.15]For real.
[57:34.31]Wait, wasn't that just the boss?
[57:35.71]I don't think so.
[57:36.13]I'm going to do that one.
[57:41.66]And then... I'm going to remove that.
[57:50.09]Take the heal.
[57:50.53]Okay.
[57:52.90]I think this is the boss, right?
[57:54.66]Because it's one floor six.
[57:56.64]The whopper was the boss.
[57:58.70]Well, how come we have another boss then?
[58:01.04]Okay, maybe we have another one.
[58:02.40]Hold on.
[58:02.82]Wait, that was a special whopper.
[58:04.98]What did that say?
[58:06.38]I think it was a special whopper.
[58:09.78]That thing's got pickles, mustard, relish onions on it.
[58:12.62]That's a special whopper.
[58:14.32]Floor five was the whopper.
[58:18.46]We're going against another whopper.
[58:21.95]On floor 8, we just did the Whopper.
[58:24.79]Now you gotta pick floor 6.
[58:26.31]Yeah, I have one choice for floor 6, and it is the Whopper.
[58:31.87]We have different things.
[58:32.75]What?
[58:34.41]Look at my... Okay, then we got another Whopper coming in.
[58:37.01]I didn't have a choice of another Whopper.
[58:38.43]I thought we had the same choices.
[58:47.44]Grimace Shake was one of the worst milkshakes I've ever had.
[58:50.12]I wanted to try it.
[58:50.78]I was just late.
[58:55.31]I thought you were going to go in there and do McDonald's and ask for a Whopper is where that was going.
[59:02.41]That's no, that is like that.
[59:04.77]Oh, that is a spectral Whopper.
[59:06.96]Yeah, that's bigger than the boss Whopper.
[59:09.76]Where is the Whopper?
[59:12.56]Oh, right.
[59:14.80]Summon.
[59:18.68]What is this puffy corpse?
[59:23.66]I honestly thought Whopper was the punchline.
[59:26.14]Um, I don't think there was a punchline.
[59:27.62]We just was saying Whopper because he said it.
[59:29.66]And we was like, oh, Whopper.
[59:30.66]And then we started talking about like McDonald's Grimace Shakes.
[59:35.22]I still can't get over the fucking comment you made earlier.
[59:40.76]It's like fucking up my whole day, by the way.
[59:44.20]Okay.
[59:46.12]I'm sorry.
[59:47.00]I thought it would make your day better.
[59:48.16]I mean, it was a wild comment.
[59:52.80]Okay.
[59:54.99]Should I taunt something?
[59:59.68]I'm getting, I'm taking nine damage at the moment.
[60:02.92]You are taking a lot of damage from what?
[60:04.84]I don't know where it's coming from.
[60:05.98]Oh, the two ranged guys.
[60:07.46]Oh, all the way.
[60:08.52]Like I have to scroll up.
[60:10.36]Wait, what?
[60:11.32]There's a big guy up there.
[60:12.44]Oh, you can actually move the camera.
[60:14.85]Yeah.
[60:15.63]WASD works.
[60:18.85]I'm going to stun him.
[60:24.49]But that's my turn.
[60:25.31]I guess I'm taking six.
[60:34.63]Did you have the Grimace Shake?
[60:37.17]No.
[60:38.83]I did not.
[60:40.19]Did you want Grimace Shake at any point in your life in June?
[60:44.91]No, I didn't.
[60:46.77]I legitimately didn't even consider it as an option.
[60:50.99]I didn't.
[60:52.19]I saw all the TikToks.
[60:54.59]It never triggered in my brain.
[60:56.09]Wait, that's a real thing that people can acquire.
[61:01.79]Dude, they're blasting me.
[61:05.49]I tried to give you some protection, but it didn't really work.
[61:14.28]Why didn't you use deep breath?
[61:17.78]I think that's not for me.
[61:19.68]I mean, I think that's not for... That's only for me.
[61:24.07]We're gonna be fine.
[61:24.63]I'm gonna be fine.
[61:28.25]Yeah, what about the Hamburglar's birthday?
[61:29.91]Yeah, does this mean we're gonna get a birthday for every McDonald's character?
[61:32.81]I mean, now they're gonna do it.
[61:35.56]Like the Hamburglar's birthday and the meal and the fries and the... There's like a bunch of characters that all have birthdays.
[61:45.50]It's my wife's birthday today.
[61:47.30]Happy birthday.
[61:47.78]Happy birthday.
[61:49.04]Yeah, thank you.
[61:49.50]I've been waiting for you to say that.
[61:52.58]You're about to die.
[61:55.00]Yo, they all want me.
[61:56.80]Can you help?
[61:59.45]Um... I can do that.
[62:03.57]I can do that.
[62:06.75]Can you kill one of the, like, guys trying to shoot me?
[62:10.39]No, I have card draw and two damage.
[62:12.56]That's all I have.
[62:20.38]Okay, I'm gonna...
[62:26.38]Your cards suck.
[62:28.28]Do they?
[62:41.10]Hamburglar is bad.
[62:42.25]He doesn't get a birthday.
[62:48.37]Out of the tier list of McDonald's characters, the Hamburglar probably is pretty low.
[62:55.31]I would say.
[62:57.19]Can you name the tier list of burgers?
[63:01.13]What do you mean wrong?
[63:04.09]Could you?
[63:04.75]I think I could do some of them.
[63:08.69]There's the Hamburglar, there's Grimace, and then there's Ronald McDonald.
[63:13.17]But there's a girl one.
[63:15.02]There's also the fry, there's like the nugget crew, right?
[63:18.93]Isn't there like a whole chicken nugget crew?
[63:20.37]This is up your alley.
[63:21.13]This is not my area of expertise.
[63:27.58]Uh, I don't, the Hamburglar schtick was like, hmm, Hamburglar was going to get on screen and go like, what does he say?
[63:34.31]He says, he has like, says two words in a row and it's like, what is it?
[63:38.23]It's like, what is it?
[63:40.39]Um, what is it?
[63:42.03]Right.
[63:42.35]Yeah.
[63:43.13]Right.
[63:43.39]Right.
[63:43.61]Right.
[63:43.99]Right.
[63:44.25]Right.
[63:44.99]Right.
[63:45.22]And then they would like speed up the footage by like 30% and they would run around in a circle and
[63:51.42]Anytime the Hamburglar was in a commercial, you could expect a 30-40% fast-forward moment.
[63:56.46]Then it was like, eh, they do this every time.
[64:03.57]I'm going to kill.
[64:05.61]So McDonald's commercials were upsetting to you as a child?
[64:08.85]No, they were just... You think you could have done them better?
[64:12.96]Yeah.
[64:13.06]Yes.
[64:14.38]Yes.
[64:23.02]going in my notebook and cataloging early Jerma thoughts and belief systems well no when I was younger I didn't think that but now thinking back I could be like you know what I could probably do a pretty good McDonald's commercial bring back like a weird cartoon shit no why not everyone trying to kill me help
[64:52.76]I can taunt.
[64:53.32]Alright, who should I taunt?
[64:54.64]Who's doing the most damage?
[64:56.32]I'm going to taunt this one.
[64:57.89]Then now that it's okay.
[65:00.33]Now it looks good.
[65:01.09]It'll give us some block.
[65:03.89]And then that's good.
[65:04.81]There you go.
[65:18.02]Alright, I can get rid of this one on the left.
[65:19.48]Don't attack.
[65:19.96]Wait.
[65:21.52]Ten or less, right?
[65:23.38]Can you do one damage to the big guy?
[65:24.90]Uh... Yes.
[65:29.06]No.
[65:31.78]Yes.
[65:38.24]What did you do?
[65:42.22]I don't know.
[65:42.84]What did you do?
[65:44.58]It says deal double the amount of damage as my gems.
[65:47.12]I have eight gems and it did four damage.
[65:58.81]Grimace has an Undertale song in his playlist.
[66:02.67]Oh, he never takes more than four damage in a single hit.
[66:04.74]He never takes more than four damage in a single hit.
[66:06.68]He never takes more than four damage in a single hit.
[66:12.76]first of all is that an official grimace playlist that you're talking about on Spotify because what what do you mean there's a this is there an official grimace birthday playlist you can't listen to that it's insane it's really what
[66:41.68]Hold on, wait, how much block do I got?
[66:45.43]Enough.
[66:45.93]The perfect amount.
[66:48.75]Can you kill that now?
[66:50.85]I am out of actions.
[66:56.79]Go play it.
[66:58.47]I'm not playing the grimmest playlist right now.
[67:02.28]Maybe we'll listen to it tomorrow.
[67:04.02]Coward.
[67:08.52]They're trying to kill me.
[67:14.46]um you could deal three damage to him come on I actually don't think I can hold on yes I can now you're only gonna take 10 damage how much health do you have you've 30 health you're fine yeah but it's it like goes away forever I'm never gonna get this youth back
[67:49.36]Who's got block?
[67:55.42]You got this.
[67:59.32]I've stooned him!
[68:02.94]Wait.
[68:04.81]This'll be... How much would this be?
[68:07.81]This'll be four.
[68:11.23]Four.
[68:11.55]Got one health left.
[68:13.77]I was counting.
[68:14.39]What were we talking about?
[68:17.23]grimace shake you see he's trying to do grimace shake and he got the purple on him three gems for that that's a good one I like this one
[68:46.96]I don't want to remove any cards.
[68:50.38]So, okay.
[68:51.50]Slay the Spire did this too.
[68:53.82]Where removing cards I always felt like I don't want to take anything away.
[68:56.70]Don't I want to add more?
[68:57.74]I don't want to take cards, right?
[69:00.20]You can press back at the bottom left and skip rewards.
[69:04.97]I'm not taking anything either.
[69:11.95]Crown.
[69:15.93]That's actually really good.
[69:23.57]What?
[69:32.52]Oh, I'll take that too.
[69:33.18]There's a lot of reading going on right now.
[69:38.24]Do you think we're going to get to the final floor?
[69:41.94]Maybe.
[69:43.06]Thin decks are better than decks bloated with garbage.
[69:45.75]That makes sense.
[69:48.59]Yep.
[70:02.21]What's your nighttime routine?
[70:04.49]Um, I just go into my bedroom and I go straight on my back like that close my eyes and I don't move until I fall asleep.
[70:17.06]That about sums up for me too.
[70:20.02]I take my horse tranquilizer.
[70:23.27]Um.
[70:24.67]I'm out.
[70:33.34]Yeah, I really am just iPad.
[70:35.26]I hate it, but so I'll just kind of lie in bed.
[70:40.77]Do you do this too?
[70:42.23]I just kind of lie.
[70:43.01]Like when I'm ready to go to bed, it's like, alright, I have my iPad.
[70:46.47]I've got like games and like videos and okay, like TV shows.
[70:52.48]I'll look at the clock and I'll be like, Jesus, what the hell is going on?
[70:56.46]Like two hours have gone by.
[70:57.96]I was supposed to go to bed like three hours ago, two hours ago.
[71:02.13]And then I just go put it down and get away from it.
[71:04.81]I do not do that.
[71:06.07]I take my horse tranquilizer and then I go to bed.
[71:11.64]Part of me is starting to understand that this is not a joke.
[71:15.48]I am not a phone reader on the toilet like you are.
[71:19.38]I'm not a device addicted.
[71:22.80]You know, I can just let it go.
[71:24.77]I feel like I could hear your lips moving to say idiot.
[71:29.36]I could hear it I'm not a device addicted I could hear like the there's no judgment in my tone if you're gonna have to sit on the toilet and read your phone and go to bed and read your phone there's no judgment but if you want to do that that's fine I guess I'm gonna I'm gonna die this round by the way yeah you should like start playing cards I feel like I've been doing a lot for you
[71:54.57]Now it's time to... You gained four block for your turn.
[71:58.19]Look how many enemies there are.
[71:58.97]I don't have... What other cards did I have to play?
[72:01.91]What have you been selecting every time we go to a vault?
[72:07.97]Let me tell you.
[72:08.33]The Hamburglar's commercials were not good, okay?
[72:11.39]They sped it up.
[72:12.15]They chased the Hamburglar around.
[72:14.69]Here we go.
[72:16.81]Alright.
[72:17.03]Now I'm good.
[72:17.53]I'm good.
[72:17.87]I got you.
[72:18.21]I got you.
[72:18.47]I got you.
[72:21.49]What's priority?
[72:25.63]But you're not communicating.
[72:26.61]Do any of your cards do stuff like that?
[72:29.11]Okay, here's my hat.
[72:30.47]Every turn, you just go like... And then I'm just like, okay, what do we do?
[72:34.33]We're supposed to be communicating as a team.
[72:39.47]Are we?
[72:40.99]We're standing next to each other.
[72:48.22]My turn's over.
[72:48.92]I played the cards I had.
[72:51.88]Defend me.
[72:52.38]What do you think I'm doing?
[72:56.52]I guess I'm going to swing at this person.
[73:00.76]What are you reading on your phone?
[73:01.84]What's on the iPad?
[73:03.56]That's when your mobile game time is?
[73:04.74]I actually don't use a device really at all unless I'm on the toilet or in bed.
[73:10.40]I don't use it ever.
[73:15.40]can't follow up that statement by I don't use it ever we have to kill this whopper up here by the way because they just look at how many this thing I know there's a lot of stuff on your side of the battlefield yeah but I I have gained two block and like deal four damage okay maybe you should be picking some cards that do things hey oh yeah what about this
[73:45.76]Uh-oh, what's this minus 24 that's about to kill you?
[73:59.35]I think we just... This is a game where you lose and you put points into permanent upgrades, right?
[74:05.97]I don't think we could have beaten this.
[74:08.70]I mean, I don't want this to be one of those games where you have to lose to win.
[74:12.47]I would like to just kill them.
[74:15.81]I think we just die.
[74:16.65]I think that's, I mean, it's the first time I'm ever playing it.
[74:23.41]Who's killing you?
[74:24.05]Who's dealing the most damage to you right now?
[74:25.96]What's the problem?
[74:28.00]Just throw a stone, dude.
[74:29.10]Everybody is hurting me here.
[74:30.00]I actually die still.
[74:35.08]No, you don't.
[74:35.42]You're good.
[74:36.38]I have... Oh, actually, I have two.
[74:37.92]You're right.
[74:38.38]It would be flashing emergency colors if you were going to die.
[74:44.13]Can you guys watch the FNAF trailer after... I've already done that.
[74:47.29]I'm not watching another one.
[74:48.61]They're going to come up with, like, five trailers over the next six months.
[74:51.39]I'm not watching them all.
[74:52.73]Isn't it kind of crazy, though, that they're making a Five Nights movie just because I played it?
[74:56.53]I heard...
[75:05.82]Dude, trailers, I'm not a big fan of trailers, especially when they make like eight of them.
[75:09.84]And effectively, they just, they take a scene, they take a scene from every single scene in the entire movie.
[75:16.91]And over the course of like five trailers, you've almost seen the entire movie.
[75:21.67]I watched the trailer and I was like, okay, so that's how it ends.
[75:25.52]Right?
[75:25.80]Like, that's the whole plot.
[75:27.18]That's everything.
[75:27.92]If you took, like, the three or four or five different trailers some of these big franchises do, you can take out all the scenes and be like, well, there's a scene from literally every single scene in the movie.
[75:37.80]You already did this rant?
[75:38.84]Well, we're doing it again.
[75:39.50]Some people haven't heard it.
[75:41.93]Some people haven't awoken.
[75:43.41]You're dying.
[75:44.01]I know I am.
[75:46.09]Every single... Wait.
[75:46.83]Can you kill one enemy this game?
[75:48.55]I can.
[75:51.05]I can...
[75:55.38]I can kill this guy and then I can kill this one, which is this one's doing five.
[76:08.14]Good luck because I lose.
[76:15.68]No, you don't.
[76:16.62]Are you going to save me?
[76:17.58]There's got to be a way to save you.
[76:19.16]There's simply got to be a way to kill every enemy this time.
[76:22.46]There's no way.
[76:23.16]I had the summoner on my side.
[76:30.92]You got 6 health?
[76:33.46]I'm about to take 22.
[76:34.42]So, technically 10.
[76:36.24]Alright, I think this is over.
[76:43.75]They all came... They all walked over to my side.
[76:51.71]Death is not the end.
[76:53.15]You've fallen in battle.
[76:54.21]You can no longer play cards or take other active actions during this fight.
[76:57.28]If your team survives, you'll get rewards as usual.
[77:02.64]Wait, I can stay.
[77:03.42]If you can do this somehow, then we continue.
[77:10.28]I don't... There's that awful at this game.
[77:13.28]Well, hold on.
[77:14.72]This is a game that I would never normally really play.
[77:17.44]And it's also the first time we've ever played it.
[77:20.76]Do we not just get any slack at all?
[77:24.50]We don't get any slack at all?
[77:26.99]No.
[77:27.25]You're dead weight.
[77:30.41]He just took that personally.
[77:36.88]Are you summoning?
[77:37.48]They're all summoning.
[77:39.74]This is what I'm telling you.
[77:40.58]I was telling you there was a summoner on my side and you were busy talking about Grimace.
[77:44.49]Ike was trying to kill him.
[77:54.01]Okay, but like, do any of your cards do stuff like this?
[77:57.26]No.
[77:58.68]Why not?
[77:59.12]I don't know because I... What happened?
[78:02.04]Maybe I should pick some of the... Yeah, I don't have any of that.
[78:06.24]I have gain block and hurt with block.
[78:10.77]I am one... I'm dead by two damage.
[78:16.37]No.
[78:19.65]No.
[78:23.33]You're a streamer.
[78:23.91]You should know how to play every game ever.
[78:31.20]Alright, so now what happens?
[78:34.54]We unlocked stuff.
[78:39.65]Okay.
[78:41.51]There we go.
[78:42.32]We got a rare voice line.
[78:44.18]You got the new spray?
[78:48.79]New artifact?
[78:58.04]Is this Harley Quinn?
[78:59.56]You finished your run.
[79:00.42]Your heroes died, but the world mysteriously reset to the time before they embarked on their quest.
[79:04.78]Maybe the next heroes you create will avenge them and break this cycle.
[79:07.82]With each finished run, you unlock new cards and artifacts for the next heroes to use.
[79:13.75]So we get better stuff.
[79:17.19]We got one new artifact unlocked, basically.
[79:20.05]Okay.
[79:23.45]Do you want to go again?
[79:24.29]Yeah, do you want to go again?
[79:27.94]Yeah.
[79:28.36]Okay, yeah, let's do it.

[85:49.59]You made me laugh so bad.
[85:51.69]I was in the middle of, I was mid-piss, and I thought about the fucking Grimace comment again, and I think you actually heard me.
[85:59.72]Like it hurt.
[86:00.87]I was, I just sit in the pain.
[86:01.79]It's just like, I just thought of it.
[86:03.11]I just thought of the fucking comment and just like, I was out of hurt.
[86:06.53]That's this stream was a success.
[86:07.85]Then I want it.
[86:08.39]Like, I want you to be in pain from at least one joke per stream.
[86:13.61]I feel like, uh, I don't have to do another, like it's, it's already enough.
[86:17.04]Alright.
[86:24.06]We good.
[86:26.48]I invited you.
[86:27.22]You got to join.
[86:28.26]Oh, there's an invite.
[86:34.52]You know, I knew you were going to do that.
[86:36.48]Do what?
[86:38.32]Make a mage.
[86:40.14]I feel like you're the one coming in and saying, I don't understand these games.
[86:43.33]How come you can't give me a break?
[86:44.37]And you're like, okay, I learned all of the warrior cards.
[86:47.57]Let me make a mage now, which is probably going to be more complicated.
[86:50.91]I was proud of you for choosing though.
[86:52.19]Like, oh, I'm a dumb warrior.
[86:53.23]I hit.
[86:54.73]This was randomly generated.
[86:57.25]Alright.
[86:58.09]Should I not be a mage?
[86:59.53]You can be anything you want to be.
[87:00.79]Alright, let me see.
[87:01.39]There's a lot of characters here.
[87:02.73]Okay, hold on.
[87:03.44]What's your favorite spell?
[87:05.84]Of all the spells?
[87:07.16]Lightning.
[87:07.68]Absolutely.
[87:08.86]Lightning in what form?
[87:09.58]Ball lightning?
[87:10.50]Lightning bolt?
[87:11.62]Lightning storm?
[87:12.76]Chain lightning.
[87:16.88]why either why because I like lightning moves in games I think are fun lightning is erratic lightning is it's like whoa it could do this damage or it could do that damage it's always kind of all over the place um I think it's the most fun to play with so what are you gonna do hold on I'm gonna do what I know right because like I'm not I don't wanna I got an artifact for the warrior character
[87:46.08]A follow-up question.
[87:48.49]We haven't talked about it in a while.
[87:50.03]Okay, what is it?
[87:52.39]How quickly did you give up on Path of Exile?
[87:56.25]No, I didn't.
[87:56.95]No, I didn't.
[88:00.65]I played a lot of PoE because I was kind of preparing for PoE 2.
[88:04.28]Yeah, but where'd you stop?
[88:07.52]Where did I stop?
[88:11.02]I don't remember.
[88:11.64]Act 2?
[88:11.96]Maybe Act 3?
[88:12.40]Act 3?
[88:17.94]I think it's great.
[88:19.34]Okay, once I figured out what was going on, it's like, okay, I get it now.
[88:23.63]And I think this is fun.
[88:24.55]But I think waiting for PoE 2 is smart.
[88:27.73]I think that's what you said too.
[88:31.66]It's a play.
[88:33.78]Apparently it's going to be longer than people thought, but...
[88:40.43]trying to get the area that I was getting name some areas in like act two or three because I I know that you were doing the bandits and you were confused about the bandits last.
[88:47.91]Yes.
[88:48.31]Okay, it was right.
[88:49.15]It was after that.
[88:49.73]It's probably like maybe okay, four or five hours of game time after that.
[89:01.95]You're not doing a mage.
[89:02.95]Oh my god, this coward.
[89:04.07]I think about mage and he crumbles and he folds.
[89:07.27]Well, I got an artifact.
[89:09.51]Okay, let's play.
[89:10.37]And this is going to make me better.
[89:11.79]Yeah, we're going to win so much more than last time.
[89:15.41]We're going to lose in the first three or four rooms, then we're going to play that fucking game that you linked.
[89:20.85]Well, you also linked a game.
[89:21.89]We're going to have to flip a coin.
[89:24.18]I think we would have more fun in your suggestion.
[89:29.32]Okay, but I think I would like to do your suggestion.
[89:31.98]We could.
[89:32.76]One day.
[89:33.46]We absolutely could.
[89:36.19]Alright, now we get it.
[89:37.71]So let's go.
[89:39.94]Oh, I get it.
[89:50.23]Yeah, what do you think of that, zombies?
[89:54.28]I genuinely do like PeeWee.
[89:57.90]I warmed up to it.
[90:04.37]OK, I mean, it's just that we talked like we were last talking about this kind of stuff like two weeks ago, and that's where you were.
[90:09.69]So I guess you just stopped.
[90:12.22]I've been busy.
[90:13.04]I've been pretty busy.
[90:14.88]The honest answer is I've been pretty busy.
[90:17.58]I accept.
[90:17.98]Alright, three damage.
[90:22.18]Go, which one is attacking this one here?
[90:26.47]You're get all dude, he's getting it.
[90:28.85]Yeah, this guy fucking gets it.
[90:37.81]The man's a cuckoo.
[90:41.21]Yeah, I get it.
[90:41.71]Yeah, I get it.
[90:42.17]This man's getting it.
[90:43.01]I'm getting it.
[90:43.47]You're getting it.
[90:43.90]We're all getting it.
[90:45.22]I let him hit me by accident.
[90:49.04]Wish I could give you my two block.
[90:50.82]And we don't have to pause every time I play a card and be like, so grievous.
[90:55.43]I mean, unless you've got another grimace take.
[90:59.55]Unless there's more to the grimace.
[91:01.65]I mean, I'm feeling kind of empty inside.
[91:03.65]Like, what's the next TikTok trend?
[91:05.23]Like, grimace is over.
[91:07.09]It's over.
[91:08.15]What now?
[91:08.53]I don't know.
[91:09.93]I need my dopamine.
[91:11.68]I don't know.
[91:12.12]I don't know.
[91:13.62]Do you have one damage to the monster?
[91:16.24]If a monster's attack leaves you with block.
[91:20.46]I think it's this one here.
[91:21.32]I just need damage.
[91:23.14]I didn't have any last time.
[91:32.40]What does strain do?
[91:35.09]If you hover over it, it'll explain it.
[91:36.77]I don't know.
[91:38.83]Hover over the card with it.
[91:39.99]Okay.
[91:41.25]Select one of three rare and legendary artifacts.
[91:43.87]I want that.
[91:49.92]I'm liking where this is going for me.
[91:52.64]Whoa.
[91:53.62]Keep unspent mana points between turns.
[91:55.72]That seems kind of unbelievably good.
[91:57.60]I hope I don't... Oh, you got ice cream?
[91:59.26]I hope I don't piss off everybody watching because I'm not going to use it well.
[92:11.20]I didn't mean to click that, but it's okay.
[92:13.84]You can reselect.
[92:14.60]Yeah, we need like upgrades and shit.
[92:18.32]Yeah.
[92:21.10]Ice cream?
[92:23.07]What's your favorite ice cream?
[92:24.37]What's your like favorite, like top three?
[92:26.57]Vanilla.
[92:27.93]I never used to be a vanilla-er, but I feel like I just awoke and became correct.
[92:33.51]That my whole life, people were like, chocolate, chocolate, chocolate.
[92:35.79]And I was like, yeah, chocolate's good.
[92:36.91]I like chocolate.
[92:37.39]And then I kind of just woke up one day.
[92:40.98]And I was like, you know.
[92:43.66]Okay, who?
[92:45.16]I'm going to kill this person right now.
[92:47.29]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[92:48.37]Do not shoot anyone in the near.
[92:51.35]Okay.
[92:53.53]How come I don't have something like that?
[92:54.95]I don't know.
[92:56.11]Why don't you?
[92:57.89]I guess it's going to be... Get rid of this guy.
[93:00.88]I just deleted my whole hand, but it's okay.
[93:05.78]Um, alright.
[93:06.86]Okay.
[93:07.06]Okay.
[93:07.48]So chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, let's go with like the basics.
[93:12.52]Your vanilla is what you would say.
[93:14.96]Yeah.
[93:15.92]We're talking about just the three basics.
[93:17.70]I feel like we talked about this before.
[93:20.34]Whenever I go to the grocery store... We can recycle content.
[93:22.24]It's fine.
[93:23.02]Okay, my go-to grocery store treat when I'm feeling a little bit sussy is when I go to the ice cream section at the Hebs in Texas.
[93:31.07]They've got all these crazy flavors, like all these weird combos, and they're always really, really, really, really good.
[93:36.53]So I just try a new one.
[93:37.79]I'm going to try a new one.
[93:43.85]That was pretty cool.
[93:44.84]Vanilla's the staple, and then beyond vanilla, it's like, I'm going to get a little bit crazy today.
[93:49.82]And you killed that guy on the left?
[93:52.18]Yeah.
[93:52.96]There we go.
[93:53.60]Look at that.
[93:57.90]Okay.
[93:58.94]Okay, but strawberry, chocolate, vanilla, you are now a vanilla ice cream enjoyer.
[94:05.57]Yeah.
[94:06.69]I would say of the three base flavors, I think it's strawberry for me, with a very important caveat.
[94:15.81]It has to be smooth strawberry.
[94:18.04]It cannot have strawberry chunks in it.
[94:22.06]No.
[94:22.84]It has to be smooth strawberry ice cream.
[94:26.46]No strawberry chunks.
[94:29.01]There was one of those crazy, sussy ice creams I was talking about that was a strawberry ice cream with chunks of, like, cheesecake in it.
[94:38.53]Okay, no, that's alright.
[94:39.23]That's good.
[94:39.79]That's fine.
[94:41.70]That was kind of, you know what I'm saying?
[94:44.74]Yeah, oh, yeah.
[94:45.32]Hot for a minute.
[94:46.36]But just regular strawberry ice cream.
[94:49.02]I don't want strawberry chunks in it.
[94:52.09]my all-time favorite ice cream if we're just talking get away from like the base flavorings uh chocolate chip cookie dough is it just it nothing compares and nothing ever will compare to that I just don't think so again I have to wonder if I've told you my chocolate chip cookie dough story
[95:09.12]I don't know.
[95:09.70]Did you puke or something?
[95:10.80]Did you eat it and puke?
[95:12.10]No, it was Easter one year.
[95:13.54]They had these like Easter chocolate chip cookie like eggs.
[95:16.77]You like unravel the egg and it's like just all like that kind of like Oreo chocolate chip cookie dough thing.
[95:22.95]Okay.
[95:24.09]And then I ate some of them and I got really sick, like really, really, really sick.
[95:28.51]And then like a week later, the next like in the morning, my brother, knowing that I got sick from these Easter eggs and it was a big deal to me, he took all of the Oreos out of an entire like double sleeve of Oreo, put all of the double stuff Oreo into a baseball and just took a big bite out of it.
[95:45.48]Oh, you did tell this.
[95:46.22]Yeah, that's kind of gross.
[95:48.26]Yeah.
[95:48.72]OK, my bad.
[95:49.84]I was a double storyteller.
[95:51.12]You can banish me now.
[95:54.31]Okay, clean your weapon, transform and upgrade sacrificial lung into what?
[96:01.70]What is it transforming into?
[96:02.96]Uh, it gives you like three options.
[96:08.40]Or two or three options.
[96:15.25]Ooh.
[96:16.47]Alright, I'm going to, let's go.
[96:22.89]Alright, I'm gonna... Let's go.
[96:28.79]New cards.
[96:29.55]Yeah, new cards.
[96:30.79]New artifacts.
[96:31.87]That's what... Oh, that's next level.
[96:35.61]Okay, but what is your... We're talking not just base flavors.
[96:39.60]What is your favorite ice cream that could have any amount of combinations in it?
[96:43.48]Vanilla?
[96:46.36]Vanilla?
[96:48.55]Yeah, but we're talking a different tier of ice cream now.
[96:52.80]Like what other ice creams do you like that aren't just a base flavor?
[97:01.56]I think that it was the one I said, the strawberry with the cheesecake in it.
[97:05.07]That was some high quality ice cream.
[97:08.17]I'm going to drop this over here.
[97:09.15]Cool.
[97:12.78]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[97:13.68]You just did something.
[97:14.66]You just did something.
[97:15.96]Yeah.
[97:16.68]I just killed everybody on your side.
[97:18.23]We're winning this.
[97:19.15]This is the run.
[97:22.15]And then check this out.
[97:23.85]Nah.
[97:25.77]I'll let you be able to hit something.
[97:42.19]I'm doing it.
[97:46.87]God dammit, I spilled coffee fucking everywhere.
[97:48.95]You .
[97:50.75]You're taking a lot of damage.
[97:53.41]It's everywhere.
[97:54.33]And I don't know what to do about it.
[97:58.87]I actually don't even know what to do right now.
[98:02.44]I wish I was there to help you.
[98:04.84]Pat you down.
[98:05.46]It's alright.
[98:20.61]I deserve it for making that fucking noise.
[98:22.05]I feel like this has happened the It happens all the time.
[98:25.93]All the time.
[98:27.00]Every time.
[98:27.58]Because especially when I take a sip of coffee, I'm like... It's like I need to like relax.
[98:36.72]I feel like two years from now, you're going to be Hector from Breaking Bad with a ding ding just rolling around waiting for help.
[98:45.42]What?
[98:47.40]It's you're progressing quickly.
[98:50.61]Every two, you get to be fucking 37.
[98:54.71]It's rough, alright, right?
[98:56.56]Man, this hill is steep.
[99:00.40]How old are you right now, for real?
[99:04.48]Almost.
[99:05.10]I'm almost 32.
[99:08.07]I'm 32 and a half.
[99:12.05]As long as it didn't get on the ground.
[99:13.11]Did it get on the ground?
[99:15.53]There is a pool of coffee underneath my zero key.
[99:18.25]And that's over desk I thought you were going to say desk.
[99:21.05]Like from all of the times you've done this and it just keeps going down there.
[99:24.47]Oh my gosh.
[99:25.75]I don't know what to do about this.
[99:27.17]I don't know.
[99:27.51]Let's keep gaming.
[99:28.49]I think I'm alright.
[99:29.27]There's a pool of coffee underneath the zero on my num pad.
[99:33.33]And that's going to be a problem.
[99:34.67]And this is annoying because I like this keyboard.
[99:36.54]My keyboard doesn't even have a num pad.
[99:38.12]Who uses a num pad?
[99:39.22]I don't.
[99:39.50]When was the last time you used your num pad?
[99:40.78]I haven't.
[99:41.20]I'm just saying that's where it is.
[99:42.08]Alright.
[99:44.40]Well, that's no problem.
[99:45.79]I hate looking at it, though.
[99:47.69]And then I'm- oh no, I have to go get a paper towel and turn it into a little stick and then slide it under and let it absorb and then pull it out and- oh my god what a fucking disaster.
[99:59.64]Okay, what are we doing now?
[100:05.22]Didn't get on the floor, so it's alright.
[100:08.47]Tip the keyboard?
[100:09.33]No, it's gonna get everywhere.
[100:13.62]I'll take the keys out and clean it up later.
[100:15.60]Yeah, I can TAKE ALL THE KEY CAPS OFF AND CLEAN MY KEYBOARD RIGHT NOW.
[100:21.20]WE'RE IN THE MIDDLE OF A GAME AND I'M STREAMING WITH MY FRIEND Ster.

[100:59.14]No, I'm saying maybe it's time to ease up on old Jerma here because I'm playing the game and I'm doing well, but I don't have coffee in my head.
[101:07.25]So if I had all these extra elements getting in the way, who knows where I'd be?
[101:12.68]But here's the thing.
[101:13.88]Holly just slipped a paper towel under the door.

[103:30.37]When coffee dries, it smells like fucking dog shit.
[103:39.71]Alright, that's as good as it's going to get.
[103:45.41]I just want to make sure it didn't actually get anywhere where it's going to be actually a real problem.
[103:49.67]And I don't think that's the case.
[103:52.39]I don't think so.
[103:53.49]I don't know, you're always making fun of me when I tell you I take caffeine pills.
[103:59.51]Stop doing that.
[104:00.05]I never spilled them all over my desk.
[104:02.49]Stop doing that.
[104:04.11]Stop it.
[104:04.65]Stop doing that.
[104:09.80]OK.
[104:11.72]Alright, there we go.
[104:12.92]Oh, but there's going to be a stain on my desk.
[104:18.70]Alright, the rest can be done later.
[104:25.76]Calm down, Hector.
[104:26.58]Alright, I'm good.
[104:36.23]I just took a lot of damage.
[104:38.13]Yeah, you are.
[104:43.37]Can you kill the close guy?
[104:44.50]The near guy?
[104:45.16]I can kill the near guy.
[104:49.56]And I'm also going to kill the far away one over here too.
[104:53.46]We got them.
[104:54.65]We do got them.
[104:56.31]My hands are very sticky.
[104:59.51]And the reason why I say this is because I usually just drink my coffee black.
[105:04.23]But I decided, I'll put some hazelnut in it and then I'll spill it all over myself.
[105:07.60]That's smart.
[105:19.08]I actually really like this card.
[105:20.06]I'm going to get it again.
[105:23.74]I've got Omega AOE in the near circle.
[105:29.46]Like when they're getting near, I just kill everything.
[105:33.84]I think this is the one.
[105:35.21]I think this is the one.
[105:39.29]I'm going to heal.
[105:45.65]Each teammate gets two gemstones.
[105:48.84]Yeah, I have that too.
[105:50.74]That seems very good.
[105:51.72]Because it costs one.
[105:54.92]Yeah, so then I just did it for you.
[105:56.26]Now you do it for me.
[105:56.88]There we go.
[105:58.36]We just both gained one gemstone for free.
[106:04.36]You're going to heal?
[106:05.72]We got the heal.
[106:06.72]I did.
[106:07.00]Feeling like you need a heal.
[106:08.10]I did heal.
[106:08.50]Oh, that's your health after healing.
[106:13.22]It is.
[106:14.55]You're at 26.
[106:14.95]You're only four ahead.
[106:16.79]Oh.
[106:22.65]Hey Trevor, can you play the original E.T.
[106:24.47]on Atari next year for my birthday?
[106:26.77]I don't know.
[106:35.64]Come on, do it.
[106:37.28]You do it.
[106:38.16]What else you got going on?
[106:40.68]Are you going to do it?
[106:41.96]No.
[106:42.16]I don't know that guy.
[106:47.25]Alright, let's actually pay attention because.
[106:50.15]We got to watch that.
[106:51.19]That's a Skeletor Zerker.
[106:53.42]Okay, this needs to die.
[106:54.70]50 health?
[106:58.32]50 health on this one.
[106:59.18]50 health on this one.
[107:01.63]Okay, what do you want to do about this?
[107:08.97]I could kill this thing.
[107:09.91]He only deals one damage.
[107:11.79]Yeah, but I think... Is he a summoner?
[107:14.67]He is giving strength to all allies.
[107:19.54]That's two.
[107:20.24]Two.
[107:22.23]But if anything comes in the circle, I can kill him.
[107:26.09]Well, let's kill... I'm going to kill the flying hog in the circle.
[107:32.03]And then I'm going to... You want to give block to you?
[107:39.96]And then I'll take some block?
[107:43.10]Does this carry over to each turn?
[107:44.80]The block?
[107:45.30]It does, right?
[107:46.98]No.
[107:47.60]It doesn't.
[107:48.66]You've been playing this game?
[107:50.28]This is the second time we've done a run.
[107:53.15]Kind of an important thing to notice, don't you think?
[107:57.68]At the start of the round, your armor is going to immediately come off.
[108:02.00]Hey, fuck you Grimace!
[108:08.50]We should be able to get rid of these.
[108:15.29]Wait, can we?
[108:17.55]I can get rid of like half of the people on my side.
[108:24.36]Okay.
[108:25.70]I can also get rid of those two as well.
[108:27.38]It's going to hurt.
[108:29.51]But I can get rid of them.
[108:31.93]It's not going to hurt.
[108:33.13]Yes, it is.
[108:33.51]No, it's not.
[108:35.97]Okay, now what are you going to do?
[108:37.99]I am going to... I'm going to kill this guy.
[108:49.27]And I'm going to kill this guy.
[108:50.41]How am I still taking nine damage?
[108:51.67]And I'm going to kill this guy.
[108:53.11]Oh, there we go.
[108:55.39]and then I can't do anything else because my other cards are blocks also remember you got that ice cream so you keep your energy between turns that's true so like don't play too many cards there bucko uh I can get rid of these two in front of us do you want to focus on the big guy
[109:28.43]I'm gonna hold because I want to save my man oh oh he's got a diamond pickaxe whoa okay what is this is he buffing himself next turn or something he's uh
[109:53.67]Yeah, he's buffing.
[109:55.49]He's growing in power.
[109:56.85]I mean, I just smoked him.
[109:59.19]What are you doing?
[109:59.95]I'm going to smoke this guy.
[110:05.64]Smoked.
[110:17.31]Smoked.
[110:22.68]New card.
[110:24.10]Your swords deal +2 damage.
[110:27.96]I like that one.
[110:30.18]This one's good too, but I need to be able to get block first.
[110:33.97]But it's definitely this one.
[110:39.01]I'm feeling quite good about this one here.
[110:42.35]I'm getting an artifact.
[110:47.32]That's pretty good.
[110:49.46]That's also really good.
[110:50.50]I need healing.
[110:52.37]I'm taking the blood.
[110:54.87]Oh yeah, get that blood.
[110:56.67]I need healing.
[110:58.31]Very badly.
[111:06.66]No.
[111:10.44]No.
[111:20.55]Uh...
[111:21.75]What is that?
[111:22.87]What are you groaning about?
[111:24.07]I'm just looking at cards.
[111:24.79]Are you just moaning?
[111:27.59]I'm just looking at cards.
[111:37.28]I don't know what I'm thinking.
[111:44.78]Oh, that's a good one.
[111:46.40]Okay.
[111:47.72]Oh, I want the upgrade.
[111:53.38]This is a Ster game.
[111:58.04]Yeah, I could see that.
[111:59.10]I could see this being a Ster game.
[112:01.88]I did recommend it.
[112:03.20]It is my choice.
[112:11.30]A lot of enemies.
[112:13.56]Okay, but they're all like stinky pigs.
[112:16.40]Okay.
[112:17.70]And we got one big guy.
[112:23.14]Uh, I can get rid of two of these, or three of these actually.
[112:26.56]Okay.
[112:28.10]Okay, I'm not going to do that anymore.
[112:31.36]Yeah, you better not.
[112:36.99]Uh, I can do this.
[112:39.83]Get rid of the big guy.
[112:42.47]Cannot do anything else.
[112:51.53]Talon arrow?
[112:53.71]Yep.
[113:00.24]Yep.
[113:01.58]Yep.
[113:03.18]Yep.
[113:05.84]I'm feeling a nap creeping up.
[113:08.31]A nap?
[113:09.19]Take a nap then.
[113:11.31]Oh, I thought you were going to take a nap.
[113:12.53]I thought you were so bored you were going to take a nap.
[113:14.67]Oh, no.
[113:17.59]This is actually big because I could probably kill all of these.
[113:22.71]If you can, I can.
[113:27.29]They all did.
[113:28.69]They all did.
[113:29.39]Oh, I'm going to kill them all.
[113:30.97]OK, OK.
[113:33.71]What the fuck your curtains cool?
[113:37.81]Sorry, I apologize.
[113:43.45]That's all I got.
[113:44.15]Might as well use it.
[113:50.97]To not take any damage.
[113:52.25]No, you shouldn't because you have ice cream.
[113:55.23]Oh, you were taking damage.
[113:56.59]I didn't know you were taking damage.
[113:57.57]Okay, yeah.
[113:58.01]No, you're great.
[113:58.45]You're great.
[113:58.93]That was great.
[113:59.67]You're gravy.
[114:00.29]You're gravy, dude.
[114:02.35]Yeah, we can kill him, right?
[114:04.91]Yeah.
[114:08.22]We're so good at this game.
[114:09.92]We're incredible.
[114:11.26]They didn't make this game knowing we were going to play it.
[114:24.14]I don't like this one I'll take this one black or green olives uh green olives for the oil black olives for the topping is my answer what was the question oil olives black or green olives never either never
[114:53.17]Really?
[114:54.67]Yeah.
[114:59.37]Oh, that's good.
[115:01.87]In a near range.
[115:07.38]The four damage in a medium radius.
[115:08.90]I actually like that one probably more than them all.
[115:11.12]I like the groundbreaker.
[115:12.46]It's two mana though.
[115:13.38]That's a lot.
[115:17.76]We got a boss coming up here.
[115:19.52]The Skeletor Kerp.
[115:21.85]Deal 5 damage.
[115:23.14]If it kills the monster, increase the damage of this card by 5.
[115:25.48]Is that permanently or just for that round?
[115:28.18]I'll try it.
[115:32.62]I don't know.
[115:35.65]It's permanent?
[115:37.33]Whoa.
[115:38.47]Cool.
[115:45.57]I want new artifacts.
[115:48.11]End of battle.
[115:48.63]Are we off sync that now I have to do a boss?
[115:52.05]Like you just did the boss.
[115:53.99]I think that's what's happening.
[116:00.78]But how?
[116:06.80]We need to.
[116:08.27]Hold on.
[116:14.89]That's a lot.
[116:15.45]That is a lot of damage.
[116:16.21]It's a lot.
[116:17.84]I only have one block I can even do.
[116:23.19]See what you can kill before you block.
[116:26.85]You got four block.
[116:28.47]These guys are dealing three damage.
[116:32.03]I can only do five damage total to somebody, and I can't kill anything.
[116:37.95]I guess I could kill.
[116:38.75]I can deal damage to things as well.
[116:40.87]I can kill.
[116:41.77]I'm part of this.
[116:42.71]Alright.
[116:43.47]Hold on.
[116:48.15]And I kill... Why did that not do more damage?
[116:54.78]What the fuck happened?
[116:56.48]I... Well, I tried.
[117:01.66]Okay, well, now that you killed the ghoul, they curse us?
[117:05.38]Oh, no, they cursed you.
[117:07.14]They cursed you.
[117:08.43]You know you're good.
[117:08.99]You're good.
[117:10.23]You're fine.
[117:10.89]A delusion card?
[117:12.47]You're delusional.
[117:13.43]Okay, how much...
[117:21.46]um you know we've been here before play doki doki literature club you just got out of a time machine from this chat in like 2018. what do you want me to look at this is bad I feel like like what there's a lot of I think we're in trouble
[117:57.43]It's weird that me as the ranger can only kill all of the things if they're in close range.
[118:03.50]This hurts a lot.
[118:09.82]Okay, your sword steal +2 damage.
[118:12.54]This would never happen if you were the mage.
[118:17.12]Yeah.
[118:22.21]I mean... Okay, but hold on a second.
[118:25.43]How the fuck are we supposed to do this?
[118:27.23]You gotta kill these big-ass zombies with the 9 HP.
[118:30.64]Okay, 9 HP.
[118:30.92]They're the ones dealing all the damage, and they got buffed a lot.
[118:34.08]I can deal 2 damage in a medium radius.
[118:37.42]Okay, I can do 5 damage to this guy on the right.
[118:42.25]I can't kill it, though, so it's like a waste of me using it.
[118:44.65]There's nobody in a cone.
[118:46.17]Wait.
[118:46.91]No, the only thing that's in a cone is this one.
[118:53.00]How much damage can you do to the guy on the right?
[118:59.44]talk to me these big zombies the big ghoulies the green guys are hitting both of us that's why we're both taking so much damage these guys here yeah okay yeah but so how much damage can you do to one of them right now I can do uh I
[119:24.22]Hold on, I need to... I can... I can kill this one.
[119:28.62]Wait, no, I can't.
[119:30.52]Oh!
[119:30.64]Wait, wait.
[119:31.68]Can you hit that guy one more time?
[119:34.52]I can, but... Because I can kill that one if you could do one more damage to it.
[119:46.85]Okay, we still both take like 20 damage.
[119:52.69]I did some major miscalculating.
[119:54.74]Yeah.
[119:58.76]I think I'm dead.
[120:00.64]You're dead?
[120:01.08]Oh, you are dead.
[120:02.42]You're dead.
[120:02.94]You die right now.
[120:08.02]What?
[120:09.72]Yeah.
[120:12.12]I mean, I think it's that we didn't know these things hit both of us.
[120:15.81]as well like you focused all your damage the first turn on the thing that cursed you when these guys are double hitting us and they're getting the damage this this arena is crazy because he's buffing their damage every turn oh death is not the end hold on let's go
[120:54.78]Yeah, apparently they don't have to attack every turn.
[120:57.02]They just were.
[120:57.58]Uh-oh.
[121:05.46]I'm dead.
[121:11.08]I guess I could kill... Who's attacking?
[121:15.67]You?
[121:16.25]Nine damage?
[121:19.19]I could do five.
[121:21.19]No, I could do eight.
[121:24.51]You're dead.
[121:25.73]Hold on.
[121:26.53]I don't think I am.
[121:27.67]You're dead there, Buster.
[121:28.75]Are you sure?
[121:29.09]I don't think I'm dead.
[121:31.33]You're kind of dead there, Buster.
[121:42.33]Oh, I had one fucking health.
[121:50.84]Shit.
[121:53.22]right this game's hard this game is pretty um pretty intense I think you also gotta consider when we're choosing the vaults and stuff what other enemies we're making but I'm confused at why we had to fight two bosses in a row do you think this game is cute I think it's good I think it's fun
[122:23.26]But I am going to suggest we play that other one.
[122:28.10]Which other one?
[122:29.02]The one you linked.
[122:31.10]The one I linked.
[122:31.74]Okay.
[122:32.16]I feel like that's going to be very fun.
[122:36.69]We can play for like two hours.
[122:37.99]I think we can pivot.
[122:39.59]Okay.
[122:40.09]No, I'm fine with that.
[122:40.63]I just got to get us that up real quick.
[122:42.91]I like the concept.
[122:43.55]I think it's really fun.
[122:44.07]Yeah, I'm probably going to play more of that.
[122:47.03]This is a Ster game.
[122:48.37]By the way, if you want to see more of Hellcard, Ster will be playing it tomorrow.
[122:56.43]Okay, apparently I'm playing it tomorrow.
[123:02.13]Are you planning on streaming tomorrow or no?
[123:04.09]I have no, I feel like the last couple of days in a row, I have like scheduled things and I can't remember what any of them are at the moment.
[123:12.64]I get that.
[123:13.56]I might not be streaming.
[123:14.72]I don't know what I'm doing.
[123:16.11]I get that though.
[123:17.29]Seriously.
[123:17.65]Okay, what was it called?
[123:20.55]Bread and Fred.
[123:27.86]Bread and Fred.
