[00:05.72]Zoe looks terrible in this poster.
[00:10.77]She looks huge.
[00:12.13]Dude, she looks like somebody, like, took their thumb and- She's got the same body shape.
[00:16.15]She looks like a male baby.
[00:17.37]She has the same body shape as a pyro.
[00:22.01]Alright, Boo, introduce this death tool.
[00:24.34]Hell came to Earth.
[00:25.48]These four are gonna send it back.
[00:27.42]That was awful.
[00:29.00]Why did you say it like the demo, man?
[00:30.52]I had, like, eight different accents.
[00:33.48]I knew that.
[00:35.34]Alright, let's, uh... Let's pull this off, boys.
[00:39.24]Alright, I'm a boomer.
[00:40.14]I'll do what a boomer is... What?

[00:42.94]What?
[00:43.38]No!
[00:43.52]What are you... Yeah, right.
[00:46.73]Aww.
[00:47.51]You don't want to return to lobby.
[00:49.31]Oh, like, ping?
[00:50.67]Oh, ping, ping, ping.
[00:52.83]Like, who cares?
[00:54.83]Oh, I... I don't know if this is...
[00:57.18]Well, okay.
[00:59.76]Alright.
[01:02.80]I don't know if you guys noticed, but Zoe looks terrible in this poster.
[01:07.94]You know what?
[01:09.00]She looks like the pyro.
[01:11.12]I hate you.
[01:13.30]What a stupid comment to make.
[01:17.07]Get out of here.
[01:19.03]Never talk to you again.
[01:20.53]These four are going to return it to the lobby.
[01:26.79]You know what?
[01:27.21]I don't really think.
[01:30.51]You know, she really looks like the Pyro in this picture.
[01:33.11]I mean, she looks exactly like the Pyro.
[01:36.90]It's crazy.
[01:38.96]Alright, now our pings are all awful.
[01:41.60]Oh.
[01:43.86]168!
[01:44.22]They're running all the way back to the beginning.
[01:49.02]Oh, that's a bad idea.
[01:50.26]They're gonna get stuck.
[01:52.91]Launch those cars.
[01:54.57]Oh yeah, I am punching those cars.
[01:58.03]Dude, you're gonna kill them all, they're at the spawn!
[02:01.57]What are they doing?
[02:02.37]Ooh, Schmoker.
[02:05.39]They're like climbing up.
[02:06.43]How did that guy get- how did the hell did they get- oh, okay, I get it.
[02:10.45]Yeah, buddy!
[02:11.16]Get off that tree, son!
[02:13.06]Oh, what the heck.
[02:14.84]My ping is too high.
[02:16.98]It kicked me out.
[02:17.80]Oh, it's made me be the tank.
[02:20.26]Your ping is too high.
[02:21.58]My ping is too high as well.
[02:26.90]I told you we just need to play against other people.
[02:31.28]I was like, I was wrecking some fools as a tank, too.
[02:34.16]Dude, I got disconnected too.
[02:35.88]Your ping is too high.
[02:39.63]Well, that works.
[02:40.31]I think Zoe looks like a pyro.
[02:44.41]I think I am bad luck or something.
[02:46.53]Alright, so we're playing survival?
[02:48.59]Okay, we're gonna play a survival map.
[02:52.13]Oh, hey, Mom.

[03:18.69]Sorry, guys, I'm back.
[03:21.95]I'm gonna hold it for three seconds longer.
[03:24.03]Should we not stick around on the roof, then?
[03:27.59]What do you guys want?
[03:28.94]You guys like the roof?
[03:30.26]I just shot you a lot of times.
[03:31.58]Yeah, you did.
[03:33.66]Sorry, Bill, floggy pyro bastard.
[03:36.50]Oh, no, Talos.
[03:39.06]I'm down here, too.
[03:39.68]Don't worry.
[03:40.56]Yeah, somebody threw a napalm.
[03:43.81]Or not a napalm.
[03:45.41]What do you call it?
[03:46.61]Gasoline.
[03:47.23]Molotov.
[03:47.39]Yeah, Molotov.
[03:47.75]Right on top of the ladder.
[03:48.83]I'm reloading.
[03:52.94]I wonder who that possibly could have been.
[03:57.54]I'm a team player, but I did just light me into one fire.
[04:01.18]Again with the fire!
[04:05.22]No, you know what it is?
[04:06.70]It's the gas tanks on the ground.
[04:09.43]We're shooting them.
[04:12.41]Is there a tank up there with you?
[04:14.39]Oh, how about that?
[04:15.75]Oh god, he just crushed his bolt.
[04:22.62]Come on, big guy.
[04:23.58]We're good.
[04:24.10]We're good.
[04:24.64]Gotcha.
[04:25.04]Gotcha.
[04:25.92]We're good.
[04:26.88]Oh, give me these pills.
[04:27.56]Alright, I'm alright.
[04:29.54]We gotta make our way out of here.
[04:32.38]More fire.
[04:33.00]More fire.
[04:33.66]More fire, the better.
[04:34.66]Oh, and spit.
[04:35.76]Okay.
[04:37.41]It's okay.
[04:37.79]Everybody has a spirit bomb.
[04:40.51]Oops.
[04:40.95]I was just shooting Bob.
[04:42.89]Apologies.
[04:44.91]I'm so trapped right now.
[04:47.57]I just want to get back on top of him.
[04:49.01]Oh god, he's right here.
[04:51.46]Oh, God.
[04:52.22]Oh, he's dead.
[04:52.70]He's dead.
[04:53.36]Oh, you alright?
[04:54.36]Oh, God.
[04:54.68]I'm alive.
[04:55.06]I just can't move.

[04:57.06]Actually, hang out right here.
[04:58.46]Hang out right here.
[04:58.90]Don't move from back here.

[05:11.97]You got a health pool?
[05:13.03]Heal up.
[05:13.65]Hey, let me throw this gas tank down on top of you guys.
[05:15.97]Don't do it.
[05:17.45]You would.
[05:17.93]That's for like 50 years.
[05:20.75]You bastard.
[05:21.97]I need to get some pills.
[05:24.09]Nice.
[05:27.47]Oh god, he sounds disgusting.

[05:33.90]Oh, there's a tank coming through the door.
[05:35.28]Oh, good lord.
[05:36.66]Oh, I found a frying pan.
[05:37.38]That'll do.
[05:37.94]It's alright.
[05:38.28]As long as we can... Oh, I'm throwing a pipe bomb.

[06:00.72]Oh, he's hitting both.
[06:01.42]I think I lit him on fire.
[06:04.72]And me on fire.
