[00:01.79]Enjoying Wrath.
[00:04.25]Yeah, I didn't have time to make a title, guys.
[00:06.47]I just found out eight minutes ago that I can't play Tony Hawk right now.
[00:12.13]That is a quick, very fast title.
[00:16.99]I've just found out I can't play Tony Hawk until I get an original Xbox hard drive.
[00:29.68]Imagine my face when it's 1 47 pm.
[00:32.20]Oh, sorry 12 47 pm pacific Uh, and I put in Tony Hawk's Underground.
[00:40.43]Oh, it's backwards.
[00:41.71]It's backwards compatible Close Here it comes You need an Xbox an original Xbox hard drive to play this game That's like a bite my finger Okay
[00:59.85]Now what the fuck do I do?
[01:00.84]Because I don't have one of those.
[01:02.26]I don't own one of those.
[01:04.96]So I have to get some third party.
[01:09.26]How am I going to put that on here?
[01:13.32]How do you attach an original Xbox hard drive to an Xbox 360?
[01:16.95]I don't understand.
[01:24.82]It's a 360 hard drive.
[01:26.12]That's not what it said.
[01:26.70]It said I need an original Xbox hard drive.
[01:37.71]Play it on PC.
[01:39.55]It's probably very hard to get that game to run on PC.
[01:42.23]I'm scared to buy it and try to get it on PC because it probably doesn't work.
[01:48.97]The 360 hard drive can do... But this doesn't have a hard drive in it?
[01:55.23]Whatever alright, I'll figure that out over the next couple days.
[01:59.25]What I want to play Tony Hawk to Buy it on PC.
[02:06.44]I gotta find it too.
[02:07.72]Alright, so we're doing a pit.
[02:09.10]We're doing a pivot here We're doing a hard pivot and this is a game that I have that I bought that I know I was gonna play it eventually and knew during an Xbox stream This was very very highly requested
[02:24.07]This is Asura's Wrath.
[02:28.38]I heard it's crazy.

[02:42.06]Alright, yeah, let's go.
[02:43.03]This is a hard pivot.
[02:46.07]I got plenty of hard pivots.
[02:48.73]This game fucking sucks compared to Tony Hawk.
[02:52.99]But don't worry.
[02:53.61]I have it behind me.
[02:54.87]I just need an Xbox hard drive.
[02:57.15]I didn't know that.
[03:00.19]I wasn't personally contacted by Phil.

[04:25.10]I am not going to apologize once on this stream.
[04:29.82]Okay?
[04:30.08]I don't need to apologize for anything.
[04:32.54]I actually saw somebody talk about this recently.
[04:35.80]They said, he doesn't have to fucking apologize.
[04:37.62]He can do whatever he wants.
[04:38.56]And I was like, thank you.
[04:39.50]Thank you for saying that.
[04:42.00]I can do whatever I want.
[04:45.94]With that being said, I'm very sorry if you happen to find something in this game that you don't- I'm just kidding.
[04:51.65]Fucking whatever.
[04:52.99]The Ser's Wrath, here we go.
[04:55.93]Can we just play on fucking David?

[05:32.40]Did you change a background image?
[05:39.22]There?
[05:41.54]What do you even possibly update with a 600 K update?
[05:46.41]This text was changed.
[05:50.33]Come on, get it together.
[05:51.67]By the way, this is from Capcom.
[05:53.55]One of the best fucking video game companies currently right now.
[05:55.84]They're really killing it.
[05:57.52]It's in HD now.
[05:58.40]Ooh, that'd be cool if it was.
[06:02.38]Alright.
[06:04.48]That's cool.
[06:07.12]Is it in HD?
[06:11.84]Wait, does it?
[06:13.82]Is it in HD now?
[06:18.12]Why does it look different?
[06:21.92]A new episode has arrived.
[06:23.20]Lost episode two.
[06:26.52]The new episode has arrived.
[06:27.52]Lost episode one.
[06:33.24]The show lost.
[06:35.78]Alright.
[06:38.48]Why only the first two episodes?
[06:39.84]I don't understand.
[06:41.83]JJ Abrams.
[06:42.75]A new episode has arrived.
[06:43.61]Episode pack part four.
[06:47.73]A new episode has arrived.
[06:48.60]Episode 11.5.
[06:51.76]A new episode of TV has arrived.
[06:53.56]Episode 15.5.
[06:54.22]There's a lot of random TV shows.
[07:02.95]I just opened up Asura's Wrath's Torrent folder.
[07:08.17]Okay.
[07:09.05]New game.
[07:14.88]I like the difficulty.
[07:15.84]Alright, is this a hard game?
[07:21.60]Players who want to enjoy the story.
[07:23.48]Players who want to seek revenge on those who betrayed them.
[07:26.50]Players who want to unleash their wrath.
[07:30.99]Hard?
[07:32.05]No, no, be real.
[07:32.91]Be real.
[07:33.59]This game's like 10 years old.
[07:35.05]Is hard too hard?
[07:39.05]Do it.
[07:39.49]Is it too hard?
[07:41.59]Normal, please.
[07:43.29]Alright, hold on.
[07:45.19]Is VRJosh here right now?
[07:46.87]Because VRJosh was one of the people that recommended this game.
[07:49.34]VRJosh, are you here?
[07:56.28]Help me.
[07:58.02]I need to know.
[07:58.70]I trust you.
[08:00.22]I only saw cutscenes.
[08:01.47]What?
[08:01.69]What do you mean you only saw cutscenes?
[08:06.75]This is like a direct recommendation.
[08:10.85]What, you watched the cutscene on YouTube?
[08:13.02]The cutscene movie?
[08:14.44]You never even played the game?
[08:15.76]I hope this wasn't a fucking mistake.
[08:29.41]This game is almost entirely cutscenes.
[08:34.87]Is it?
[08:38.37]The ending of this game is locked behind DLC.
[08:42.09]Oh, great.
[08:44.11]Paramount Pictures?
[08:45.54]What did Par... Oh, what?
[08:48.56]I thought that was spelling Paramount.
[08:50.22]I was like, holy shit, that's kind of cool.
[08:56.30]Oh, we're beasts that roam the land of the Goma.
[09:00.97]in order to save civilization from their never-ending threat the demigods who govern the world created an ultimate weapon that would wipe the goma off the face of the planet once and for all their legions were led by eight elite demigods the eight guardian generals one of them general Asura was one of them produced by Capcom developed by Capcom
[09:29.54]Pretty good extensive use of the Unreal Engine 3 lighting effects.
[09:38.21]Like that bright yellow light is in every game from 2012 to like 2016.
[09:43.15]Wait, didn't I already press start?
[09:48.41]I already pressed start.
[09:51.28]What?
[09:58.61]Okay, press start again.
[09:59.85]Oh shit.
[10:01.98]Lock on fire.
[10:08.16]What am I firing at?
[10:12.36]Is this like Star Fox?
[10:23.49]What the fuck is that?
[10:25.51]What is going on?
[10:26.37]Did I kill it?
[10:31.85]I would like it if there was not text all over the screen.
[10:34.75]Whoa.
[10:37.13]Rapid fire.
[10:37.87]X. Am I dead?
[10:46.42]It's cinematic.
[10:47.30]Oh.
[10:55.61]Alright, for a second I didn't know what those buttons were.
[10:57.27]I was like, what is GS?
[10:58.51]And it was right stick.
[11:01.01]I was, I was fucked it up.
[11:12.98]Is your Xbox running in 1080?
[11:14.24]It's rough on the eyes.
[11:15.80]Yeah, it is.
[11:17.30]This game, what's on the back of the box?
[11:20.30]Does this game even have 1080p as an option?
[11:29.45]uh 720p 1080i 1080p it should be it's no it's not hold on how do I check check your Xbox settings settings preferences what was what was it under preferences
[11:56.81]System settings.
[11:58.27]Because you'll end your current session.
[11:59.47]Let me get to, like, a save point first.
[12:00.93]Sorry.
[12:01.32]No, no, no.
[12:02.06]It's fine.
[12:02.64]I think it just looks like this, guys.
[12:17.24]No, it's not because it wouldn't be it would be fucked up looking on my other screen, this is 1080.
[12:23.64]Guys, this is 2012 1080.
[12:24.38]This beat.
[12:27.32]Is the brightness on 200%?
[12:37.61]You know what?
[12:41.53]You know what?
[12:42.79]It might be.
[12:43.25]Let's check.
[12:44.73]Alright, coming to the QT.
[12:47.06]Is that better?
[13:08.92]It's better, right?
[13:10.08]Yeah, that's better.
[13:10.72]Alright, yeah, the brightness was up for some reason.
[13:13.74]Good job catching that.
[13:14.60]I wouldn't have thought that.
[13:16.78]Alright, hold on, I gotta go back.
[13:30.02]That sounds like one of the dragons in Warcraft.
[13:32.30]Sorry, let me rephrase that.
[13:34.12]Any dragon in Warcraft.
[14:08.66]This is actually kind of cool.
[14:10.48]Big, cool enemies.
[14:12.24]When do I get to play the game?
[14:16.52]Oh, look at that!
[14:18.76]I want to be that demigod.
[14:21.06]This is the game.
[14:21.86]No, it's not.
[14:24.03]This is not the game.
[14:25.32]This is like the first little tutorial cinematic part of the game.
[14:31.12]This is not the whole game.
[14:33.08]I don't have a health bar.
[14:35.94]This is not the game.
[14:37.30]It's the opening cutscene.
[15:00.42]What do you mean he seriously doesn't know?
[15:03.18]This is not the game.
[15:04.36]This is the opening cutscene.
[15:23.27]That was a pretty sick Jerva raptor.
[15:25.39]It was the exact noise.
[15:35.28]Alright, let's go.
[15:45.61]You're halfway done with the game.
[15:47.81]The whole game is just an E3 demo?
[15:50.09]No.
[16:11.88]The Eight Guardian Generals, Yasha.
[16:13.52]Oops.
[16:13.92]There he is, the Eight Guardian Generals, Asura.
[16:42.77]It's him.
[16:43.23]There he is.
[16:43.67]Can I crash into this one?
[16:50.59]Now, I know this is not the actual game, because games aren't hard.
[16:52.87]This is not hard.
[16:56.28]This is not a game at all, actually.
[16:58.98]So, how could it be hard?
[17:01.02]What kind of cheating is this?
[17:19.66]Uh, the game won't register how fast I can do it.
[17:23.16]Sorry guys.
[17:23.96]What the fuck is going on?
[17:49.53]Oh nice, you're in level two.
[17:56.90]Nice.
[17:57.14]Level two, here I come!
[18:14.58]Have you forgotten that I am most concerned when the beauty of destruction is before me?
[18:21.37]My strategies are flawless.
[18:24.27]Why are we just all sitting in a Google Hangout?
[18:31.66]Don't we have Earth to save?
[18:32.86]I don't understand.
[18:34.84]Okay, there's supposed to be eight generals?
[18:37.78]I think that's like twelve.
[18:54.38]The music's too loud.
[18:57.32]I can't even hear what he's saying.
[19:00.73]They made the music too loud!
[19:16.53]You just triggered my Google Home.
[19:32.35]Get your Google Home away from the speakers of your computer!
[19:41.91]You hear that sometimes.
[19:43.03]Dude, what the fuck?
[19:44.23]Alexa just started responding to me.
[19:47.25]Is Alexa in your headset?
[19:50.96]No, put Alexa in, like, your fucking living room and turn the volume down.
[19:56.04]Not in, like, your office.
[19:57.46]I know, office in quotes.
[20:08.22]The Brahmastra.
[20:10.24]This game looks fucking dumb.
[20:22.10]Don't pay.
[20:23.82]This game was $60 when it came out.
[20:27.28]I have no idea how much it is now.
[20:30.15]I really don't know how much this was.
[20:33.17]It might still be $60.
[20:33.87]I have no idea.
[20:36.63]Alright, we made it to the impurity level.
[20:43.71]Holy shit, wait, did the Earth just turn into a monster?
[20:51.89]Well, we were not prepared for this.
[21:04.08]Okay.
[21:05.72]We're getting a commercial break?
[21:09.16]Yes, this is actually the... The anime has the commercial break.
[21:21.66]All we needed right there was a voiceover.
[21:26.88]Here we go.
[21:30.93]Am I going to float around and speak things out of my eyes or whatever it is?
[21:38.73]Fullmetal Alchemist.
[21:43.97]The worst part about those is it says it twice.
[21:47.26]You don't need to say it on the return.
[21:50.99]Especially when you're watching a repeat of it for a DVD or, you know, on Netflix, whatever.
[21:56.81]And it goes, Fullmetal Alchemist.
[21:59.79]Fullmetal Alchemist.
[22:00.79]It's like, you don't just cut that second one out.
[22:02.91]Like, where's the quality control?
[22:16.38]This is the longest opening ever.
[22:18.30]Up there in the levels?
[22:32.13]Is this a third-person action game?
[22:34.31]I think, no, it is, right?
[22:35.78]How long is this game?
[22:59.42]Wait, wait, wait.
[23:02.46]No.
[23:03.78]This is not it.
[23:05.64]This can't be it.
[23:06.83]This is like a third-person, like, Bayonetta kind of game, right?
[23:10.19]Like, Devil May Cry.
[23:17.35]Yeah?
[23:18.81]No?
[23:25.25]He really believes that.
[23:26.89]No, I do.
[23:35.38]No, this is... Oh, shit.
[23:37.67]Fuck!
[23:37.79]That doesn't mean good!
[23:38.69]That doesn't say this is very fun to play.
[23:41.47]It...
[24:01.22]It means... It means it's... It's different!
[24:05.12]Dot, dot, dot, dot.
[24:06.63]Interesting!
[24:08.27]It's interesting.
[24:13.37]And all the stuff in the back of the box.
[24:14.68]Yeah, there's no... I don't know what I did.
[24:17.42]I'm gonna give it a chance.
[24:18.14]No, I'm not gonna... This is what we're doing.
[24:34.89]In 16 years of playing games.
[24:37.05]What?
[24:38.53]Am I dead?
[24:45.86]Alright, you can take that quote.
[24:47.44]In 16 years of playing games.
[24:49.46]I've never seen anything like this.
[24:51.02]It was so bad.
[24:52.16]It's the worst game I've played in 16 years.
[25:01.74]That quote could be like, in all of my years, I've never seen anything so bad.
[25:07.81]What?
[25:13.38]I did it.
[25:30.43]Didn't get perfect.
[25:31.29]No, this game is good.
[25:35.01]I know it is Good
[26:09.92]Wait.
[26:18.44]What troubles you?
[26:19.58]Wait, Asura is a Street Fighter character.
[26:21.15]I could not kill it.
[26:24.97]No one can kill Vlitra.
[26:27.75]You should be grateful you were able to subdue it.
[26:34.15]We have suffered more casualties than ever, but it will not be back for a while.
[26:38.86]You should rest.
[26:42.99]Asura... Oh.
[26:43.91]No, he's... Asura's in Street Fighter.
[26:45.25]I'm confused.
[27:04.55]The power of my eight guardian generals is invincible!
[27:09.28]May Shinkoku prefer in everlasting glory!
[27:21.04]The time is near.
[27:25.42]Soon you will get to play a video game.
[27:29.68]Episode 1.
[27:42.14]Imagine if that was it.
[27:44.16]To be continued.
[27:45.30]I got an A. I'm good.
[27:50.06]New concept art has been added.
[27:52.14]War of Creation.
[27:55.76]A new video has been added.
[27:57.16]Episode 1?
[27:57.78]Alright.
[28:06.98]Alright, let's go.
[28:12.48]Uh... Alright, let's go
[28:35.28]Congratulations, Commander.
[28:36.38]We have once again succeeded in suppressing... That means nothing, and time will be back and pose an even greater threat than today.
[28:42.66]That vile beast destroying would be more troublesome than I had anticipated, and who would have thought that Helion Asura would be the one to quell... That was only possible because we have a comic book in... Alright, so the first part of the game was an interactive movie.
[28:56.70]And now the second part of the game here is a comic book.
[29:00.22]The third part of the game will be playing a video game.
[29:06.80]I hope.
[29:08.04]It was only possible because they had aid of the priestess.
[29:17.68]Okay.
[29:18.62]Yes, his daughter, Mithra.
[29:20.06]We might very well owe our victory solely to her.
[29:22.08]The priestess proves to be more useful than Emperor Streda himself.
[29:25.40]Okay, perhaps I said too much.
[29:29.44]No.
[29:29.92]Well, yes.
[29:31.44]Yes, you have.
[29:32.82]Just a little bit.
[29:35.01]Alright, can I have like an earpiece while I fight that like you can tell me the rest in my earpiece?
[29:41.16]Not just yet, he can still be useful to us.
[29:42.96]Haven't had any new info come up.
[30:07.73]For now, we must concentrate on completing the Karma Fortress as well as finding more efficient- Give it a chance!
[30:13.18]Hold on!
[30:14.10]Just give it a chance.
[30:14.98]This game's only like four and a half hours long.
[30:17.46]Just give it a moment.
[30:18.62]Just wait a minute.
[30:20.96]Without that, rest assured, Commander, I have already devised a plan for it all, including the priestess.
[30:27.13]Just skip the filler episodes.
[30:28.89]This is not- Okay, episode one is not a filler episode.
[30:33.77]If episode 1 is a filler episode of your TV show, holy fuck you did it wrong.
[30:40.79]Very well, proceed as planned.
[30:41.91]Failure is not an option.
[30:44.85]Wait, what?
[30:45.71]What happened in episode 1?
[30:47.06]Is this a preview?
[31:04.21]Did this game come out?
[31:05.35]No, it didn't.
[31:07.48]I didn't skip anything.
[31:09.72]Go to the next episode.
[31:11.24]That was an episode one recap?
[31:20.01]Skip the previews.
[31:20.73]It's going to spoil things.
[31:21.77]Okay.
[31:22.03]The day after the defeat of... Whatever.
[31:33.99]I hope I get QTEs to walk.
[31:37.02]And, like, shake hands and wave and shit.
[31:41.08]See, no one's ever went full fucking absolute QTE.
[31:45.32]I want a QTE where every button is me.
[31:47.24]I have to press A every time I take a step.
[31:48.92]Like, I have to do QTEs right now.
[31:52.44]And if I fail it, I have to start the whole thing over.
[31:58.44]Oh, that's... that's... that's wife.
[32:03.97]Alright, easy.
[32:06.81]Just like tripped three times.
[32:13.64]You're safe.
[32:14.24]I am.
[32:17.84]Welcome home, father.
[32:21.78]She failed the QTE.
[32:23.34]General Asura, the Emperor summons you.
[32:30.40]He awaits your presence in the throne room.
[32:33.07]Alright.
[32:48.32]This is like an Android or something?
[32:51.70]These fucking frames.
[32:52.94]It's 2012 1080p, don't you know?
[32:56.30]They cared so much about having a huge resolution.
[32:59.61]Games... Xbox 360 couldn't run this shit at like more than 20 frames a second.
[33:04.55]But it was like 1080p!
[33:09.99]Having a game at 720 or like 480 was like... No, no, no, no, no, no.
[33:13.39]Excuse me.
[33:13.89]Don't do that.
[33:15.79]Ugly.
[33:21.72]Oh shit, it said press A. I pressed B. Oh fuck.
[33:26.17]These are hard.
[33:26.83]What?
[33:40.88]What is this?
[33:42.20]What'd you do?
[33:44.58]Insurrection.
[33:46.08]Treachery.
[33:46.48]Everybody's failing QT.
[33:48.10]Reason.
[33:58.87]Alright, so they think I did it.
[34:01.01]It's the classic I didn't do it.
[34:04.31]But I have blood all over my hands.
[34:07.19]So it has to be me.
[34:10.44]That's classic.
[34:18.58]I don't understand.
[34:19.42]What the hell's happening?
[34:27.63]still part one what episode is this wait episode two part one episode two betrayal and vengeance of part one of episode two you traitorous no it wasn't me why don't you just why do you have to have anything episode two part one of episode two
[34:55.34]Episode two, part one of episode three.
[34:58.30]Here we go.
[34:58.90]Gameplay.
[35:02.90]Why is B attacked?
[35:03.88]That was pretty fun.
[35:22.62]just do heavy attack then it is easy the FPS yeah don't you know and stunning 1080p graphics absolutely stunning
[35:52.67]Asura's Wrath.
[35:57.63]Asura's Wrath.
[35:58.70]What the fuck is going on?
[36:20.17]I think the moral of the story here is don't ever touch anyone.
[36:25.94]You know what I mean?
[36:27.00]What if they're dead and you have blood on your hands?
[36:34.82]She just came up behind and put her hand on her back.
[36:36.66]What if she was dead and you had blood on all of your hands?
[36:38.39]Don't fucking ever.
[36:39.73]Always make sure the person's alive first.
[36:41.19]No!
[36:49.89]Did I just kill this guy?
[36:56.67]Ooh, that's kind of cool.
[36:58.47]Oh, well, I thought A was dead.
[37:00.35]Do I have a health bar?
[37:01.84]Can you die in this game?
[37:02.82]Ooh, perfect.
[37:08.84]Perfect QTE.
[37:21.57]I won.
[37:23.36]Dude, he got one.
[37:24.44]That's one of the eight.
[37:34.27]You know what the best part about full sprint close-up run is in any form of media?
[37:41.45]The suspension of disbelief is if they cut to, like, he's in another country.
[37:45.98]It's like, oh, okay, that makes sense.
[37:49.64]Oh, don't touch her!
[37:50.84]Don't go, don't, no, no, no, get away!
[37:54.70]No, no, you idiot!
[37:55.70]Didn't you just learn anything?
[37:57.91]You!
[37:59.09]Who did this?
[38:00.19]Oh shit, it wasn't me, I swear!
[38:02.05]Have you learned nothing?
[38:07.43]Save her.
[38:10.63]I will.
[38:12.53]Save your strength.
[38:25.02]UTE her back to life I think that's how this works Who's that?
[38:57.67]Hold on.
[38:59.40]Isn't this like the exact story of God of War?
[39:01.68]Like the exact story.
[39:04.52]Didn't this happen in God of War?
[39:06.18]Kind of.
[39:09.99]Yes, play that.
[39:31.89]Why are you in there?
[39:35.58]You can't see with that on.
[39:37.06]Why would you put that on?
[39:39.18]Yes.
[39:40.02]I did what was necessary for the cause.
[39:45.67]Because I have decided to save this world.
[39:49.97]I will create a new civilization.
[39:53.18]A great rebirth.
[39:57.62]I'm not that concerned about the guy that can't see right now.
[40:02.82]I can't see anything.
[40:04.20]I could throw a rock at that guy's head and it would probably knock him out and I could beat that guy.
[40:17.38]Not even eye holes.
[40:18.52]Why would you have eye holes?
[40:24.39]I don't know why I'm looking way too much into that one.
[40:27.97]But really, that's just a big piece of metal covering your eyes.
[40:34.76]I'm going over the edge.
[41:20.43]Next Smash Brothers character?
[41:23.17]Oh, he's already in Street Fighter.
[41:27.94]He's getting zapped back to level one.
[41:38.83]Can't I fly?
[41:40.87]Wasn't I just flying?
[41:41.77]Just fly.
[41:45.24]What?
[41:45.50]You know how to fly.
[41:49.54]I know how to fly.
[42:02.01]Well.
[42:06.62]Alright, well, she just got turned into an N64 character.
[42:10.75]You just degraded her graphics quality.
[42:12.85]Uh-oh, that's not good.
[42:20.08]I kind of turned her into a cake.
[42:24.18]She just turned into a cake.
[42:25.80]Alright.
[42:29.03]To be continued.
[42:38.41]Did I even have to do anything?
[42:39.95]Oh, I had to fight a little bit, yeah.
[42:42.79]Look, I got S. This one's hard, too.
[42:44.83]Imagine playing this one easy.
[42:54.84]A new video has been added, so you can just watch the... Alright, let's go.
[43:02.48]You're going to end up with zero viewers.
[43:04.58]No, I'm not.
[43:06.50]Relax.
[43:11.19]From the myths passed down by generations of humans far and wide, the evil demigod who fell from the heavens.
[43:16.97]So this is fake about me.
[43:21.47]Long, long ago, there lived eight legendary demigods.
[43:25.30]They were known as the Eight Guardian Generals.
[43:27.10]They led the demigod legions against the impure Goma, bringing peace and prosperity to the world.
[43:37.15]Yeah, this is like fake.
[43:38.85]This has been made up about me, right?
[43:40.61]One of them was black of heart and had ambitions of his own.
[43:43.07]His name was Asura.
[43:44.07]Yeah, this is like they scapegoated me, right?
[43:47.55]Selfish with his own aspirations, he turned against his kind and struck fear into the demigod race, taking the life of their emperor, Strayda.
[43:57.20]It was a dark time.
[43:58.60]Black clouds cloaked the sky.
[44:00.98]Unpenetrated by the sun's rays, plants and trees all over the world withered and died.
[44:04.80]Humanity was overcome with grief and sorrow.
[44:14.48]Then just when it was believed that all hope was lost, seven pillars of light poured down from the heavens and the remaining seven Guardian Generals appeared.
[44:24.07]Under the command of the great Gaius, they fought heroically against their brother who betrayed them and avenged their emperor's death by sending Asura to his own.
[44:33.38]Henceforth they became known as the Seven Deities, and they watch over the humans from the heavens.
[44:40.24]But they don't have a great marketing team, because pretty boring.
[44:46.53]We were the eight.
[44:47.85]Now we're the seven.
[44:49.24]That's it.
[44:49.94]It's minus one.
[44:51.00]Oh, it's Asura.
[44:51.64]Alright, alright.
[44:52.62]Skip, skip.
[44:53.18]We're watching the preview for the next episode.
[44:55.08]Right, I don't know.
[44:55.60]Alright, whatever.
[44:56.28]Does it really matter?
[44:58.06]Does it matter?
[44:59.06]Uh...
[45:17.35]Oh my god, there was a spider there.
[45:19.11]You know what that means.
[45:21.83]Don't skip DansGame.
[45:30.38]We're still getting opening cutscenes credits.
[45:40.15]Oh, thank god he grabbed onto that edge.
[45:44.27]How long have you been doing that for?
[45:51.00]episode three hell on Gaia where am I well this is naraka but I won't bother explaining because I doubt you would understand so for now let's just say you are having a bad dream
[46:13.16]The golden s- the golden friendly spider.
[46:17.45]Half you guys just started to like the game.
[46:21.43]Oh no, not QTE.
[46:41.96]5,000 bits just came in from Filactory.
[46:46.04]5,000 bits.
[46:48.28]$50.
[46:48.36]Please play this whole game.
[46:49.80]The boss fights are a huge... Such a huge spectacle to see.
[46:55.06]I mean, we're here, so... I didn't fail this?
[46:58.00]You can't fail this.
[46:59.18]What if I press it down?
[47:04.31]I cannot fail that.
[47:05.75]Thanks for the $50, Spiral Actuary.
[47:17.08]We're here.
[47:17.52]I got no other plan, man.
[47:18.90]I was going to play Tony Hawk, but I need a fucking hard drive, and I didn't know that because I'm stupid.
[47:24.78]I'm not even that stupid.
[47:26.22]I'm actually pretty smart.
[47:27.78]I would say I'm like average intelligence.
[47:29.71]I am.
[47:30.09]I am.
[47:30.81]We make jokes on this channel, but I know what I'm doing.
[47:35.74]Wait, isn't this one of the seven?
[47:51.61]I already know how to do this.
[47:55.41]This is tutorial two.
[47:57.11]This is tutorial two, part two, episode two, part one.
[48:07.27]Every heavy attack causes Asura to overheat for a period of time.
[48:11.21]Heavy attacks cannot be used while overheating.
[48:13.57]This is a cool map.
[48:18.47]This game is so hype, I love it.
[48:22.70]Yeah, see everyone is relaxed.
[48:23.96]Just because the first hour of the game is... ...a TV show.
[48:36.27]So while you're overheating, you can't... Hold B to form a dash.
[48:41.89]See, this is just like DMC, man.
[48:45.71]This is just like DMC.
[48:47.92]Boy, I love this game.
[48:49.54]It's just like fucking DMC, too.
[48:50.84]Alright, after pressing A, hold B to...
[49:09.34]DMC2 was the shitty one.
[49:11.75]Oh.
[49:13.19]Sorry.
[49:14.01]I have not played one second of any of the Devil May Cry games.
[49:17.05]Not one second.
[49:19.37]Press Y to execute a special attack when your enemy is down.
[49:22.53]Especially, yeah, we've learned how to do that.
[49:28.07]Is it good?
[49:28.81]I thought people loved those games.
[49:34.91]Who are you talking about?
[49:35.55]You're a fake Capcom fan.
[49:39.22]I never claimed to be a real Capcom fan.
[49:43.38]What?
[49:54.15]People love them all except BMC too.
[49:55.87]Oh.
[49:57.23]So you're telling me I picked the one that everybody hates?
[50:02.65]Don't think you'll come off unscathed.
[50:05.82]Pain reminds you you're fighting for your life.
[50:10.73]Uh-oh.
[50:12.23]Big boy.
[50:13.29]Asura can recover directly after being hit by pressing A. Recovering reduces damage and allows Asura to quickly get back into a fighting stance.
[50:21.17]So I can knock down Asura immediately after getting hit.
[50:24.44]Like, okay.
[50:26.64]They have to hit the ground first.
[50:28.22]So... Oh, we missed.
[50:30.24]Come on.
[50:30.44]Let's go!
[50:43.90]Oh, finally, an evade.
[50:45.48]Now this is my game.
[50:47.71]Oh, yeah.
[50:49.09]Dodge roll.
[50:52.65]Like, there's no way I lose now.
[50:53.65]You guys know me in a dodge roll.
[50:55.71]It's... I'm so good with a dodge roll.
[50:59.25]Four buttons, dodge roll.
[51:01.23]I will not have a single problem in this game.
[51:03.31]Guaranteed.
[51:04.96]Press the correct on-screen prompt right before an enemy attacks to execute a counterattack.
[51:10.53]Dodge roll, baby.
[51:11.29]Yep.
[51:17.83]Again?
[51:19.03]Do it again.
[51:23.66]This game is the equivalent of somebody saying, trust me, this show is good.
[51:26.48]You just have to get past three episodes.
[51:31.00]Yeah, kind of.
[51:32.87]Don't get distracted by multiple enemies.
[51:36.39]Concentrate on one at a time.
[51:39.34]And then by the time you get past the third episode and you're on the couch and they look over at you and they can tell that you're not into it, they know that they've failed.
[51:48.65]And they're just sitting there going, God damn it, they're not into this at all and they should be at this point and they're not.
[51:55.31]So I'm just going to give them an out.
[51:57.52]And you give them an out simply by saying something like this.
[52:01.08]Alright, that's three episodes in.
[52:02.68]I mean, that's a lot of TV.
[52:04.48]Yeah, it's a pretty cool show.
[52:06.82]We can do something else.
[52:07.96]I'm going to take the DVD out.
[52:10.58]I'll take it out.
[52:12.77]And then they either go, yeah, yeah, that's a lot of TV.
[52:15.37]Three episodes before, that's a lot of TV.
[52:16.81]You're right.
[52:17.31]That's pretty cool, though.
[52:18.31]That's when you know, take the fucking DVD out and do something else.
[52:20.41]They don't want to watch the show.
[52:21.69]And they never will.
[52:23.73]Hold X for rapid fire.
[52:25.43]What?
[52:28.32]What?
[52:30.08]Oh, I actually have to aim this thing.
[52:37.08]Why can't I just do that normally?
[52:38.36]Why would I ever punch with fists?
[52:42.06]And then, yeah, you never watch her bring it up ever again.
[52:49.93]And then you feel terrible because...
[52:52.85]You love this show.
[52:54.53]And you're like, fuck, man, I just watched three episodes of this show.
[52:57.29]I'm gonna keep going.
[52:59.57]And then you get, like, 25 episodes in, because this is, like, the fourth time you've watched this show.
[53:06.03]And... They might come up to you at some point in the future and be like, hey, dude, you wanna watch, like, episode four?
[53:11.90]And you're like, fuck, I don't wanna watch the show again from the beginning again.
[53:16.78]We had a chance, and now I already went, like, two seasons ahead of this.
[53:19.62]Now I have to watch it again.
[53:22.72]I know.
[53:23.24]I've been there before.
[53:24.54]Trust me guys.
[53:25.22]You can use rapid fire to shoot down an enemy.
[53:34.48]Analog aiming.
[53:40.54]Why is he teaching me this?
[53:41.44]Is he one of the... I didn't start... I haven't stopped.
[53:50.15]What is he shooting from?
[53:52.23]Um, I don't know.
[53:53.77]Spines on his back?
[53:56.13]That's what I gather from this.
[53:57.71]This is a flashback, you idiot.
[54:04.14]Sorry.
[54:06.48]Sorry, I wasn't aware we were in Episode 3, Part 1 of the second part of the second tutorial.
[54:17.82]Apologizing.
[54:22.16]You already said that joke.
[54:23.50]I'm gonna say it again because it's very relevant right now.
[54:26.96]Don't apologize.
[54:27.86]I'm not apologizing.
[54:28.88]No, I'm not sorry.
[54:29.72]Alright, inflicting and receiving damage increases the unlimited gauge.
[54:35.31]Once it's full, unlimited mode can be activated by pressing LT.
[54:39.65]Automatically activated in easy mode, okay.
[54:43.76]Fill up the unlimited gauge by attacking.
[54:49.06]Where am I?
[55:04.05]I wish there was a block.
[55:08.93]Why can it not lock on?
[55:10.09]Isn't LB lock on?
[55:15.46]Is it full?
[55:20.38]How do you fill it if it's unlimited?
[55:21.72]I don't know.
[55:25.92]Your guess is as good as mine.
[55:27.54]That's a lot of bar to fill up.
[55:34.26]Alright, it's full.
[55:35.22]Now, use it by left trigger.
[55:47.28]In unlimited mode, Asura's strength is increased and he cannot overheat.
[55:53.95]But I just can keep... Clicking damage upon enemies increases the burst gauge once full burst can be activated by pressing RT and unleashing a devastating attack, okay?
[56:11.61]I have two gauges.
[56:20.37]Higher DPS?
[56:21.04]Do you level up in this game?
[56:23.30]No wonder.
[56:28.44]I'm gonna try this.
[56:30.58]There you go.
[56:34.30]I can hold it?
[56:43.79]Why the exact moment of impact increases your synchronic rate with Asura?
[56:47.70]Do you have a high enough synchronic rate and get... What?
[56:58.57]Get what?
[57:01.21]Ooh...
[57:18.50]That's a cool sword.
[57:23.24]That'll be all for today.
[57:24.54]Is that a machine gun?
[57:27.78]That was like distant machine gun fire.
[57:29.40]What was that?
[57:31.51]My name is Asura.
[57:43.81]Yes, that is your name, Asura.
[57:50.72]This spider's probably worth a lot of money.
[57:56.16]I mean, it's covered in jewels and shit.
[58:05.03]Solid gold spider covered in sapphires.
[58:10.41]Where are we now?
[58:11.93]Wait, where am I?
[58:19.85]Where am I?
[58:20.89]Alright, I get it.
[58:44.76]Not bad.
[58:46.36]Game's pretty fucking fun.
[58:47.82]Yeah, game's pretty fucking fun.
[58:51.39]I imagine that I'm saying that while I have a crying face.
[58:55.51]Game's pretty fun, guys.
[58:56.49]I got a lock on his end.
[59:10.26]Play Hulk Ultimate Destruction Resonance Libra.
[59:12.82]Well, recommend it then.
[59:15.93]You can't just come to the stream and be like... Hey, dude.
[59:19.43]Why is this not Hulk Ultimate Destruction for the fucking Wii?
[59:23.51]I don't have that game.
[59:24.69]Let's go.
[59:37.88]That guy has a point.
[59:40.41]I don't have that game.
[59:41.71]Should I get it?
[59:42.39]Is that game fun?
[59:43.53]What?
[59:49.41]The ultimate in Unreal 3 lighting.
[60:10.68]You know, I could do this with the OBS sliders.
[60:15.16]In fact, I feel like I've done it already.
[60:29.23]Do it.
[60:29.53]Unregistered Hypercam?
[60:39.24]No, it will be unregistered Wii.
[60:42.70]I don't know why, and I'm going to probably make a lot of people angry with this, but I feel like that's how Twilight Princess looks the whole time.
[60:52.23]Did I just make anybody angry?
[60:53.25]I may have.
[60:53.97]Not a bad game.
[61:08.10]Shut up.
[61:08.94]I'm still angry, though.
[61:10.62]Hmm?
[61:11.90]What's the matter?
[61:13.04]Have I angered you?
[61:14.06]Not you.
[61:22.28]Not me?
[61:26.46]They're crying.
[61:28.69]Crying?
[61:30.11]In Arakka?
[61:32.85]There is nothing to hear but the sound of
[61:36.65]It's at this point where I go, alright, listen buddy.
[61:38.37]You tell me exactly what's going on or I'm breaking a leg off and making a million.
[61:43.58]You know what I mean?
[61:44.52]I'm taking a fall.
[61:45.16]I'm taking a leg.
[61:46.04]And I'm gonna get a million.
[61:47.32]Tell me what's going on.
[62:01.57]The next time you talk in a riddle, I'm melting you down into a necklace.
[62:06.66]It'll be that easy.
[62:11.23]He's very angry.
[62:35.23]Did you get the DLC for this?
[62:36.45]No.
[62:36.63]I did not.
[62:38.15]I can't get the ending without it.
[63:06.54]this place looks like hell this is you after Simpsons hit and run how many episodes are there in the I'm such show and I would have been right but how many episodes are in the part one episode three how many parts and how many episodes 13 episodes
[63:38.16]15 parts?
[63:41.14]Alright, I was told skip the next part.
[63:47.33]Because we don't want spoilers.
[63:48.49]It's 12 parts total.
[63:53.13]7 episodes.
[63:56.79]What?
[64:00.16]12 parts in 7... 2 episodes per part?
[64:07.72]A barren land somewhere on Gaia.
[64:09.54]A golden spider.
[64:13.00]What do you think?
[64:13.48]It's become a tad desolate since you were here last.
[64:16.83]I can hear thunder in the distance.
[64:18.45]Can you see the lightning?
[64:19.67]It is as red as blood.
[64:23.07]So you remember.
[64:23.81]Yes, the threat of the Goma still remains even now.
[64:27.25]Curious as to what your former comrades have been doing?
[64:29.45]Hmm, over there, have a look.
[64:37.19]They... They looked at Goma?
[64:39.95]Not quite.
[64:40.93]This was the work of your own race, the demigods.
[64:43.69]What?
[64:44.92]They now have control over the world as they do please as much as they want to.
[64:48.76]Paraphrasing, actors do that.
[64:51.32]Changing Gula a few words around.
[64:53.88]That can't be!
[65:01.75]A lot can change in 12,000 years.
[65:03.90]If you don't believe me, why don't you go see for yourself?
[65:07.16]Shut up!
[65:08.88]There's that famous Asura anger.
[65:11.34]Well then, this world shall be your playground.
[65:14.88]After a long slumber, Asura- Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh!
[65:17.87]No, there's a bell in this one.
[65:18.99]Fuck, I'm done.
[65:21.67]Somebody hits a bell and shit and it's probably very important.
[65:23.95]Alright, next episode.
[65:32.19]Bell spoiled.
[65:34.58]I'm so fucking mad right now.
[65:36.02]Fucking stupid fucking thing.
[65:37.32]I just want it to be spoiler free.
[65:40.58]Like, what the fuck?
[65:43.30]Mr. God.
[65:44.50]I haven't seen, like, Star Wars Episode 3 yet.
[65:48.67]Like... No, not the sequel.
[65:51.61]I'm talking about, like, the actual, like, the prequel trilogy.
[65:53.47]Don't fucking talk about it.
[66:02.61]What's wrong with me?
[66:13.97]I'm angry.
[66:14.61]Alright, I used all my anger powers, and now I'm a little slowed down?
[66:23.62]This is post-anger?
[66:24.74]Oh, I have to go this way.
[66:28.44]Don't talk to me, I'm angry.
[66:31.27]yeah this really is like the don't kids playing down here alright everybody used to be quiet

[67:00.02]God damn it, I knew that was gonna happen.
[67:02.81]I'm so mad that we saw that.
[67:19.99]This really is just he's very angry walking around.
[67:33.50]That's the face that a little kid makes when they don't get to ride the ride at Disneyland.
[67:49.34]I don't think the rest of the day they're just like, no.
[67:54.20]Do you want some lunch?
[67:55.10]No.
[68:02.26]Do you want, insert your favorite thing that I know you love?
[68:06.41]No.
[68:07.17]What'd they do?
[68:19.84]Ooh, get reversed.
[68:31.55]Jeremiah, I think you should have gave him a hard one.
[68:33.63]Yeah, I know.
[68:43.34]I do have a health pot.
[68:49.87]It's just Batman.
[68:51.38]It's just Batman.
[68:53.08]It's Batman with a much, much larger window to actually block and counter.
[69:01.66]This is Batman, but the game freezes and tells you the button to press for five seconds.
[69:21.94]Whoa.
[69:23.34]Purification for Private Joji.
[69:25.14]I'll have the same line.
[69:27.94]Destruction, destruction, destruction, destruction!
[69:39.02]Back from the dead, impure demigod Asura!
[69:44.03]We shall send you back to the shadows of death, along with the Goma!
[69:58.95]Okay, who made this?
[69:59.85]I know Capcom did, but what Capcom did?
[70:01.49]Which Capcom did?
[70:03.61]Wait, what happened?
[70:05.35]LT!
[70:07.76]Super mode.
[70:08.74]Okay.
[70:26.21]Like, what Capcom studio?
[70:32.53]Almost dead.
[70:34.41]Wait, why is he fighting these things?
[70:43.02]Dive or what?
[70:52.56]Capcom Canada.
[70:55.40]Is that a real company?
[70:58.48]Cyber Connect.
[71:00.60]Cyber Connect 2.
[71:04.19]Unregistered Hypercam 2.
[71:11.91]Unregistered Cyber Connect 2.
[71:19.94]All ships, prepare for purification.
[71:26.82]Didn't we already beat this guy?
[71:28.61]Wait, back-to-back bosses?
[71:32.39]Alright.
[71:32.85]Whoa!
[71:57.49]QTE?
[71:58.89]Not quite.
[71:59.47]He's in the ground, though.
[72:00.17]Get him.
[72:00.43]Get up.
[72:06.68]Get the combo up.
[72:11.08]How do you... Alright, that hurts a lot.
[72:17.06]I'm actually gonna die.
[72:21.99]I'm gonna build up my QTE meter.
[72:25.00]I told you not to do hard.
[72:34.65]Oh, it's alright, I'll be alright.
[72:39.20]Everything's gonna be fine, don't worry.
[72:48.38]He's almost dead.
[72:48.94]I don't want to use my QTE thing.
[72:58.42]I almost got him.
[73:02.30]See you later.
[73:04.94]He's gone?
[73:14.57]Oh.
[73:16.62]Okay.
[73:17.76]Bonehook Crusher.
[73:18.84]Impurity level 680.
[73:20.16]So now I have to fight a giant elephant.
[73:29.39]We just keep getting more and more logical.
[73:38.09]What did he just do?
[73:39.42]Oh, he's eating their souls.
[73:48.84]Do they get to go back into the bodies?
[73:51.90]Nope.
[74:02.07]Right now he's sitting there going... Is it dead?
[74:04.45]Is this fucking thing dead?
[74:05.89]I hope so.
[74:06.53]What should I be doing?
[74:15.79]What Lord Deus spoke of was true.
[74:19.43]There's always a bigger fish.
[74:20.75]It has been a while, traitor.
[74:26.67]We do it again.
[74:29.95]Let's go.
[74:31.43]No.
[74:32.43]Next episode, we'll do that.
[74:40.04]I'm going to be completely honest.
[74:42.36]What the fuck is the point of that?
[74:47.27]This game's interesting.
[74:47.97]I like this game.
[74:48.37]It's actually interesting.
[74:49.11]But what is the point of that?
[74:52.43]It's not TV.
[74:52.79]Why is it there?
[75:01.94]It's for pacing.
[75:05.54]Commercial?
[75:11.00]But there's no commercial.
[75:13.68]It'd be funny if there was commercials.
[75:16.04]Like, made-up products.
[75:18.43]The Seven Deities.
[75:20.01]Wizen.
[75:29.56]Shut up, Wyzen.
[75:34.42]I can do that?
[75:58.81]Shut him up.
[76:01.39]Your ears have become so sullied that you cannot even comprehend words of purity.
[76:08.67]Feel my wrath!
[76:11.54]Ooh, you have wrath too?
[76:13.00]Let's go.
[76:16.06]Alright, does it dash?
[76:17.46]I can't lock on.
[76:18.12]Come on, he's on the ground!
[76:26.26]I can't.
[76:31.30]Oh.
[76:31.80]Shit.
[76:32.90]Can I get away from that?
[76:35.20]Does it blow up or something?
[76:36.64]Does it explode?
[76:42.80]Oh, what's that?
[76:47.36]What's that?
[76:53.23]Throw it back.
[76:54.11]Yep.
[76:54.31]Come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here, come here.
[76:59.77]Oh.
[77:14.40]Eat this.
[77:20.23]Omega LOL tuber voice, what?
[77:26.13]Am I doing a tuber voice?
[77:27.55]When?
[77:28.87]When did I do a tuber voice?
[77:30.33]This guy's fucking dead.
[77:40.35]No, he is!
[77:41.80]Oh.
[77:53.53]He's gonna come back up.
[77:56.39]Why is it fucking sucks laughing my ass off?
[77:58.41]No he doesn't, it's not over.
[78:00.29]Alright, I didn't think he was gonna be this huge.
[78:15.43]I feel like it should be a lot deeper and a lot more echo.
[78:37.49]His voice should be a little deeper.
[78:47.02]Press B again.
[78:48.08]Hold on.
[78:58.60]Do I have time to go let Otto in here?
[79:00.58]Otto wants to come in here.
[79:01.36]I don't think I have enough time.
[79:03.03]Hold on.
[79:03.31]Let me pause the game.
[79:06.52]Oda wants to come in and hang out.
[79:14.26]And then on the next episode, they replay the last five minutes that just happened until we get to that point again.
[79:28.11]Alright, I'll be right back.

[81:53.02]I'm sorry.
[81:55.83]Alright, here we go.

[82:02.07]You don't say.
[82:02.75]Imposterous.
[82:04.19]That's impossible.
[82:05.69]Nothing is impossible.

[86:33.73]What are you wearing?
[86:34.27]This is like a suit top.
[86:36.81]I don't have anything clean right now.
[86:43.77]I just did it.
[86:44.89]You look nervous.
[86:46.42]I'm going to keep this on just in case something happens.

[86:55.76]Professional streamer.
[86:58.68]What is this link?
[86:59.53]Alright, I'm trying to watch my favorite animated television show, okay?
[87:03.97]What does fucking naked mean?
[87:07.21]What?
[87:07.63]What?
[87:07.97]What?
[87:08.37]What?
[87:11.61]I know.
[87:12.03]Yes.
[87:12.49]Yeah.
[87:13.62]It doesn't matter.
[87:14.18]It's fine.
[87:16.60]I know.
[87:17.20]I'm not showing this on stream, but that's fine.
[87:20.86]Alright, here we go.
[87:21.78]We're going back to the game.
[87:24.87]Yeah, I know my audio wasn't synced.
[87:27.29]Because I'm playing an Xbox game.
[87:30.89]Show auto?
[87:31.57]No, I can't!
[87:36.93]Is nothing but a speck of dust of the past.
[87:40.32]Indeed, our power was nothing compared to what we are capable of now.
[87:45.63]Show auto.
[87:47.09]I cannot show... Okay, I'm gonna be completely and totally transparent with you guys.
[87:52.13]The reason why I can't show auto is for very specifically.
[87:56.21]I don't have a shirt on.
[87:57.65]I have a suit fucking jacket on.
[87:59.69]And I have a pair of shorts on.
[88:01.72]That... That's it.
[88:04.58]I can't... I cannot do webcam right now.
[88:11.46]So, I can't do that.
[88:14.10]I'm not prepared for this.
[88:17.69]Put on a shirt.
[88:18.45]I don't have any shirts.
[88:20.09]They're all being in the laundry room.
[88:27.63]This is bullshit.
[88:28.49]No, I can't even prove this because I'll get banned.
[88:31.63]Alright, that's it.
[88:32.39]Who cares?
[88:33.57]I'm just going to play the game.
[88:35.07]That's what you're here for, right?
[88:37.04]No, no, no.
[88:37.78]This game sucks.
[88:38.46]I don't like this game.
[88:39.84]Where is the ultimate Shrek Hulk game?
[88:43.30]Okay.
[88:43.44]Okay.
[88:46.07]I think there was a time when we had to actually exert effort to purify one large goma.
[88:50.37]Oh, how pitiful we all once were.
[88:53.74]How shall we proceed, my lord?
[88:55.32]If it pleases you, I can depart immediately to purify him.
[89:00.66]I've already sent Wizen.
[89:01.80]Let him take care of our old friend.
[89:03.06]I already beat Wizen.
[89:04.83]That's what you don't know.
[89:06.13]I can imagine the look on Asura's face now.
[89:07.71]He hasn't the slightest idea how powerless he is right now.
[89:11.69]We like Fortnite.
[89:12.73]Well, good.
[89:13.13]I'm glad you do.
[89:15.00]You'll never see that channel.
[89:16.06]You'll never see that game on this channel.
[89:19.74]Whatever.
[89:22.26]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[89:23.12]I think you'd be surprised.
[89:24.66]Explain!
[89:26.29]There are no guarantees in battle.
[89:27.65]Nothing is impossible.
[89:28.59]Ha ha ha ha ha.
[89:39.94]We like Fortnite.
[89:40.72]Play it, old man.
[89:41.46]You play it.
[89:44.57]Wait, what did you say?
[89:45.97]You have 11,000 subscriptions and can't afford a shirt.
[89:54.79]What?
[89:55.29]You want me to go buy a bunch of fucking expensive shirts?
[89:59.24]Why?
[89:59.60]I want to go buy a bunch of expensive shirts.
[90:05.91]No!
[90:06.47]What?
[90:06.99]Why would I do that?
[90:07.69]I have, like, eight Star Wars shirts and, like, two blazers and two... and, like, four shorts.
[90:13.12]They're fine.
[90:15.98]And I have, like, a couple of nice shirts.
[90:18.68]I have some nice jeans.
[90:23.02]You want to go spend, like, 600 bucks on, like, a nice button-up that I'll wear once a year?
[90:27.76]No, I can wear my $12 Star Wars shirts every day and not have to spend $1,000.
[90:42.26]Alright, here we go.
[90:42.78]Do I have to hold up?
[90:47.02]Oh, this is... Use left stick to drag the reticle over enemies to lock on.
[90:54.24]Press wide release on the blast once.
[90:55.81]The more lock-ons you have, the more powerful the blast will be.
[91:00.41]Is that it?
[91:01.13]I actually like this thing in the game.
[91:08.15]It's funny.
[91:12.73]Just go.
[91:15.35]It's easy.
[91:16.99]I was reading chat.
[91:18.03]Sorry.
[91:18.27]Not going to get a perfect now.
[91:20.43]You can fail because it doesn't matter.
[91:31.80]This is just Shadow of the Colossus, but far less buttons.
[91:36.66]Alright.
[91:39.60]I'm getting hit.
[91:42.48]Alright, yeah, I'm getting hit.
[91:50.19]McDonald's of the Colossus.
[91:54.55]Whoa.
[91:55.15]Uh-oh.
[92:16.72]the best part about that is I was a little too deep down in the dirt and he didn't even he didn't depress it down any further so I was fine I was too deep down in the rock can you feel it this was loud she suffers to atone for your sins and to bring about the great rebirth
[92:52.44]I feel like a shitty DJ.
[92:53.50]I feel like four buttons.
[93:02.59]Shitty DJ pauses all the music.
[93:06.28]It does that and then turns the music back on where it left off.
[93:08.68]Six arms.
[93:23.72]I can actually hit, wait.
[93:32.29]Oh, he's attacking.
[93:34.43]Okay, I thought he was wicked far away.
[93:37.07]I thought he was like a thousand meters away.
[93:38.81]I thought that was him.
[93:50.78]Go.
[93:53.18]Super damage.
[93:55.66]Oops.
[93:56.44]Why am I looking at chat right now?
[94:02.76]What a mistake.
[94:14.91]Did I just wait and do this?
[94:22.48]Am I throwing it back?
[94:23.66]There we go.
[94:24.42]There we go.
[94:31.54]Throw it back.
[94:34.32]Cursed!
[94:36.46]We demand attention.
[94:42.58]Screamer goes on Coke Binge and loses all close.
[94:59.20]This still exists.
[95:00.38]Can we end this?
[95:05.54]I thought I was... Did I jump?
[95:10.51]Oh my god.
[95:17.33]Oh fuck, I'm gonna die.
[95:19.31]Okay, I can't get hit anymore.
[95:26.54]How do I dodge this shit?
[95:27.86]I'm dead.
[95:39.61]I got disconnected from Xbox, why?
[95:41.99]What the hell did I do?
[95:51.02]Throwback.
[95:54.30]Got it, throwback.
[96:02.62]That's me.
[96:13.40]Alright, Burst.
[96:17.58]So Burst is just go into a cutscene and continue.
[96:25.99]Spin it around.
[96:27.23]Come on, by his finger, throw him.
[96:30.23]Uh-oh, here he comes.
[96:44.85]Ooh, that was quick.
[96:45.71]That was weird.
[96:46.79]That slowed down.
[96:48.59]Okay, we're good.
[97:14.07]I can't hit it that fast.
[97:17.27]It's not registering when I do it too fast, see?
[97:20.61]I'm pressing it a million miles per hour, you guys know how fast I can do that.
[97:24.63]It doesn't register some of them.
[97:30.60]Please explode.
[97:34.00]Explode.
[97:40.36]This jump, I've got this blazer on, this thing is so hot.
[97:58.08]I was waiting for him to do a big breathe in like, and you think you can beat a god?
[98:02.40]And that asteroid like sucks into his throat.
[98:04.58]That's probably what would happen.
[98:05.60]I mean, think about how powerful that breath is.
[98:22.69]What the fuck?
[98:23.81]You have a phase three.
[98:26.26]It's even bigger.
[98:27.92]I am an absolute unit!
[98:30.00]Hey!
[98:30.38]We'll see you on the next episode.
[98:55.31]He never stops growing.
[98:58.53]What do I do about this now?
[99:01.17]The guy's as big as like three or four planets.
[99:08.26]Gongan Wizen.
[99:10.94]Holy shit.
[99:12.02]He's set up like a pool shot.
[99:30.16]Oh, that's a pretty big finger.
[99:31.50]That finger is the size of, like, New Hampshire.
[99:35.55]We gotta be careful.
[99:49.23]Stop.
[99:49.87]Stop.
[99:51.59]Let's go.
[99:54.22]Oh, God.
[99:56.13]And it's hot too.
[100:12.22]Holy shit.
[100:14.71]Alright, this game just increased to full letter grade.
[100:27.43]Nice bitrate.
[100:28.41]Why do I have a... Why is my memory in, like, 1200 upwards?
[100:58.77]Bro!
[101:04.51]Come on!
[101:05.57]I can do it faster, but it won't register a lot of them if I do it too fast.
[101:08.31]Uh oh.
[101:28.38]I'm doing it so fast.
[101:30.92]What?
[101:36.32]Oh my god.
[101:36.84]Which way?
[101:37.18]Which way do I go?
[101:40.98]I was going the other way.
[101:53.34]You're a little bed bug.
[102:15.68]Well, the sad part is we lost the entire Western Hemisphere because of that.
[102:33.57]Hey, look, there's your cool explosion.
[102:36.69]Did I just destroy Earth?
[102:39.75]Why are you here, Asura?
[102:41.71]Is this a spider?
[102:42.49]Do you even know what you want?
[102:47.43]Who is going to repair my auto mill?
[102:48.75]Total rank.
[103:18.44]Let's see.
[103:21.50]Aww.
[103:21.92]It's alright.
[103:22.34]I get a B. Sixth armed Bajra Asura.
[103:28.69]New concept art.
[103:33.57]New video.
[103:34.89]New achievements.
[103:39.35]Cool.
[103:41.84]Next episode.
[103:42.58]Let's go.
[103:44.88]Robin Atkins Downs?
[103:45.58]Yeah.
[103:46.42]Yeah.
[103:48.03]He is in this game.
[103:52.45]Episode five, a hollow victory.
[103:57.45]Impossible, how could Wyzen have lost to him?
[104:00.53]He has brought shame to the seven deities.
[104:03.63]In all honesty, I'm not surprised Wyzen was the weakest among us after all.
[104:09.22]He lost the moment he believed that size equals strength.
[104:14.19]So we're gonna have to do the thing that Asura did to him.
[104:17.07]We just have to shrink to like one thousandth his size.
[104:21.91]This is gonna be like a tiny ant boss, right?
[104:24.68]I would assume.
[104:32.28]In any case, the real problem is the fact that fat idiot wasted a significant amount of the mantra.
[104:36.71]An amount that took us so long to accumulate.
[104:39.03]That fool.
[104:42.27]Our cause will not waver because of something as trivial as this.
[104:51.58]Who cares about the cause?
[104:52.80]I'll kill him for fun!
[104:55.78]Not so fast.
[104:56.74]A large coma has appeared on the surface with Wyzen gone.
[105:00.04]I need someone to handle it.
[105:02.55]Then have someone handle it!
[105:03.59]I only follow what my blade thirsts for.
[105:06.91]Everybody in the room, their eyes just all rolled to the back of their fucking head.
[105:14.51]Oops.
[105:15.11]While you two were arguing, Yasha went after Asura himself.
[105:19.33]He he he.
[105:22.35]Hmm.
[105:22.73]That could be fun to watch.
[105:26.61]No!
[105:26.83]So we're just gonna get boss, boss, boss, boss, boss, end of the game.
[105:38.52]That's so funny.
[105:39.12]They're all just gonna come one by one and die.
[105:41.86]In extravagant fashion.
[105:51.93]I just want this guy to take a few steps, and like walk into a sign.
[105:55.15]His head just rocks back, just like, ba-boom!
[106:10.56]It hits him like in the mouth a little bit too, it's like really bad.
[106:12.92]You know when somebody like really actually walks into something and it fucks them up.
[106:16.34]Like they hit someone like the face, the mouth, yeah!
[106:22.41]Okay, this is my brother.
[106:28.03]We were at a mall.
[106:29.87]Hold on, this is like funny.
[106:31.51]We were at a mall and we were- I don't know why I'm thinking about this right now.
[106:37.38]But we were walking together and
[106:41.42]I don't know what happened, but there was a sign.
[106:44.82]You know, like in the mall, those signs, the little stand-up signs with a rectangle that's in this little metal frame, and it's just on a single stand?
[106:53.50]Do you guys know what I'm talking about?
[106:56.48]Oh, they have those?
[106:59.59]It's just a single stand sign that's up at about like four or five feet tall.
[107:03.88]Alright.
[107:04.56]So we're walking around and there was a poster for a Goldie Hawn movie.
[107:12.02]Goldie Hawn movie.
[107:12.66]I don't know which one it was.
[107:15.15]And it was like Goldie Hawn was in the middle and there was two other people next to her.
[107:21.28]And she was, like, just sitting there.
[107:22.60]And he was like, Hey, look!
[107:24.36]We should go see that movie!
[107:25.92]And he was just making, like, a joke.
[107:27.40]Let's go see that movie!
[107:28.48]But he wasn't paying attention in front of him.
[107:30.20]And he just... Ba-boom!
[107:32.77]Like, rocked into this sign.
[107:34.49]It was fucking crazy.
[107:38.01]I have this memory burned in my brain.
[107:40.65]Forever.
[107:44.59]It was like... It was just...
[107:48.89]I haven't thought about this in, like, 25 years.
[107:52.69]But he was pointing and going, Hey, let's go see that movie!
[107:56.17]And then right when he got to the V in movie, he just, like, his head just rocked.
[108:00.43]He was fine.
[108:01.07]The thing didn't weigh that much.
[108:02.17]It was just kind of... It was just... It was just, like, ridiculous.
[108:08.43]Ugh.
[108:10.45]This is not, like, a joke or anything.
[108:11.77]Like, it was just... I have that burned into my brain forever.
[108:14.73]And I'm, like, seeing it again.
[108:18.86]He failed the QTE.
[108:19.90]No, he didn't fail the QTE.
[108:20.90]He was reading chat and wasn't paying attention.
[108:24.70]That's a silent film joke.
[108:26.14]Now I keep seeing it.
[108:31.94]It was like a cartoon.
[108:33.12]Alright.
[108:33.84]I'm not going to pay attention.
[108:37.44]I don't have any arms.
[108:39.68]Oh, this is funny.
[108:45.67]I can't even fight this guy!
[108:56.85]Is this the Travis voice?
[109:00.43]Am I supposed to lose?
[109:01.99]Just dodge?
[109:03.15]This guy just is unfair.
[109:13.66]Fuckhead!
[109:15.60]Stop making me laugh.
[109:16.60]I keep seeing my brother walk into the sign.
[109:18.56]Watch it.
[109:19.88]Alright, he's at the dodge.
[109:21.89]I have dodge and then go at him.
[109:45.58]I can't fucking attack him!
[109:47.42]Wait, should I dive kick him?
[109:51.19]I'm gonna dive kick him.
[109:53.07]That didn't work.
[109:53.87]Oh, wait, I can do that.
[110:06.92]You gotta do a big dash kick.
[110:15.78]Take back your daughter.
[110:20.57]You got a big boot'em.
[110:22.65]It is pointless, Mrs. You lost 12,000 years ago.
[110:28.12]That was your fate.
[110:29.48]Leave it at that.
[110:31.22]There is no place for you in this world.
[110:44.25]Don't kill me don't kill me
[111:15.38]Oh, there it is.
[111:15.92]Get out of here.
[111:18.72]Got it.
[111:20.46]See you later.
[111:28.49]Did I miss?
[111:29.09]You can miss.
[111:47.40]You can miss that.
[111:48.12]I thought it was just press RT and watch a movie.
[111:51.64]Thanks.
[112:27.46]What do you mean it was two?
[112:28.32]No, it wasn't.
[112:34.60]Let's go.
[112:35.32]I get it.
[112:35.66]I got it now.
[112:36.14]I got it.
[112:36.44]I got it.
[112:36.74]I got it now.
[112:37.22]I got it.
[112:39.16]Come on.
[112:41.91]Do the swing.
[112:42.75]Two swings.
[112:54.84]Nice, good combo.
[112:56.56]This is pre-recorded.
[112:57.98]No, it's not.
[112:58.60]Stop saying that.
[112:59.48]Don't say that.
[113:00.74]Hundreds of millions of souls.
[113:24.32]You are not familiar with our way of life.
[113:26.59]Yes, I am.
[113:27.81]I used to be one of you.
[113:28.55]Wasn't I, like, number eight?
[113:30.61]Ah.
[113:41.65]You were demigod.
[113:42.53]Oh, shit.
[113:43.21]Alright, here we go.
[113:44.37]Burst.
[113:44.55]Come here, come here, come here, come here.
[113:51.70]Oh, shit.
[113:53.56]I got him.
[114:18.72]Oh, I think I missed.
[114:20.28]Oh, then I won't be able to see!
[114:53.07]Whoa.
[114:54.91]I mean, that's, uh, that's a pretty, that's pretty, come on, that's like a, that's a boss move.
[115:06.88]I'm not even worth avoiding because they don't hurt.
[115:09.34]Damn, oh boy.
[115:24.30]Did I get it?
[115:26.46]Pretty sick T-pose.
[115:30.72]Oh no!
[115:31.08]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[115:33.38]If it's Ron, I can avoid that.
[115:54.33]Oh, fuck!
[116:00.12]What's he doing?
[116:04.52]Run?
[116:07.22]He's gonna hit him with a visceral attack.
[116:24.23]I got greedy.
[116:28.23]Just kick his ass.
[116:38.86]Can I fire?
[116:40.74]Oh, what's happening?
[116:41.76]Okay, I'm good.
[116:44.90]Let's A to recover.

[117:30.64]No choke.
[117:33.43]Here we go.
[117:47.53]There is nothing you can do.
[117:48.37]As priestess, Mithra has dedicated herself to the salvation of our world.
[117:54.94]You should be proud.
[117:55.82]What did you say?
[118:14.89]Am I making a machine?
[118:16.79]Oh, he's making me angry.
[118:18.67]I'm going to say the thing that makes you angry again.
[118:20.61]You motherfucker!
[118:46.82]Oh boy.
[118:47.16]Into the lava?
[118:56.64]Can I put it on?
[119:08.14]Can I just like worm my body over there and slide it on my face?
[119:10.82]Does it do anything to me?
[119:12.82]Is it like putting the mask on in the Jim Carrey movie?
[119:26.25]You are as ugly as ever.
[119:29.13]As is your temper.
[119:31.55]But... He's ugly.
[119:39.68]Before the cause.
[119:43.32]It is me.
[119:50.74]He did the... Am I cut in half?
[119:59.81]Do not return again.
[120:01.81]Still getting... credits for this game.
[120:09.77]I think I know who wrote the game by now.
[120:23.10]Witness the salvation of the world from the depths of Naraka.
[120:32.51]Is this a bad ending?
[120:38.73]Yeah, I mean, I could say that that thing that everybody says, but... What?
[120:49.62]What?
[121:00.38]Did this turn into Kingdom Hearts?
[121:03.50]Where's Goofy?
[121:05.38]Where's Donald Duck?
[121:24.52]Where's Mickey?
[121:29.32]Presented by Capcom.
[121:33.04]Cool.
[121:40.75]coming up next on the next episode of Asura's wrath yeah that was part one part one is its own season of TV
[122:16.41]No, what's gonna happen is it's gonna open up the next one and it's gonna be like Start slow and you're gonna hear You're kidding me We're gonna get a full recap of what happened
[122:37.73]in the first part of Part 2.
[122:42.17]We're talking like, potentially 10 hours of gameplay shown in about 4 minutes.
[122:52.85]Didn't they do that in Kingdom Hearts 2?
[122:58.37]They just like, skipped a whole portion of the game, right?
[123:06.54]Clip that one.
[123:07.12]Why?
[123:14.22]Is that bad?
[123:16.34]Probably.
[123:16.88]Worst thing in 2020.
[123:17.82]Go fucking bookmark it then.
[123:23.02]Alright, this will be the second time we've taken your father from you, won't it?
[123:32.53]When is the Half-Life stream?
[123:36.28]I've never said I was going to play Half-Life.
[123:37.72]Alright, why do I put words in my mouth?
[123:42.32]I said I wasn't going to play Half-Life.
[123:48.91]Not I was.
[123:49.93]What?
[123:50.55]I don't think I'm going to play.
[123:51.37]I'm not going to be playing Half-Life on this stream.
[123:53.09]Hey, so when's Half-Life?
[123:56.07]I... This will be the second time we've taken your father from you, won't it be?
[124:07.70]He didn't even know what a lambda was.
[124:09.12]Shh.
[124:10.66]When this is all over, you have the right to take my life and I will accept death gladly.
[124:14.60]It's gonna be tomorrow.
[124:16.14]No, it's not.
[124:20.21]I guess I've played Half-Life like six times.
[124:22.43]I'm not playing Half-Life.
[124:26.53]No, I don't want to play Half-Life.
[124:28.03]I'm not playing Half-Life 2.
[124:29.05]It makes me want to puke.
[124:30.29]The boat level makes me sick.
[124:33.41]It's a really good game.
[124:37.85]But for now, you will have to wait.
[124:47.06]Just watch this episode with me.
[124:52.01]It's the only way.
[124:52.77]We need your power.
[124:53.63]The world needs it.
[124:56.37]Belitra is constantly unleashing Goma upon the world.
[124:59.67]If we do not have Mantra to fight against them, there is no hope for civilization.
[125:08.05]Your power to amplify, Mantra, is our sword and shield.
[125:10.43]We cannot bring salvation to Gaia without you.
[125:15.87]Half-Life, Half-Life, Half-Life, Half-Life.
[125:17.55]Let's go, now, now, now, now, now, now.
[125:23.13]Sura, why do you choose not to listen to reason?
[125:27.70]Mithra's power is essential to the cause.
[125:29.56]Once we defeat Velitra, Mithra and the world will be saved.
[125:34.72]Stubborn fool.
[125:42.16]500 years later.
[125:43.28]12,000.
[125:43.30]That's a long time.
[125:58.95]Part 2.
[125:59.81]Rebirth.
[126:02.08]Suburban fool won't play Half-Life.
[126:05.74]God damn it.
[126:09.88]Wait, we're doing this again?
[126:21.29]Yeah.
[126:21.89]Hey, can you do- can you-
[126:46.13]Can you bite me?
[126:47.31]I feel like that would be beneficial to me.
[126:49.96]Just bite me right on the neck.
[126:51.62]No, not even Spider-Man.
[126:53.10]I feel like this thing's powerful.
[126:54.70]Just, like, bite me.
[126:55.70]And, like, inject venom into my bloodstream.
[127:13.08]But it seems he cannot do it without your daughter's power.
[127:20.36]Mithra.
[127:21.74]Now, remember why you are here in the first place.
[127:24.68]It will spur you on, my boy.
[127:29.40]Remember.
[127:29.94]If we're two hours into the game and I get another part two tutorial, it's going to be tutorial two.
[127:41.11]They're going to introduce a mechanic or something.
[127:52.06]What's the point of this?
[128:17.44]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[128:22.22]It's a filler episode.
[128:26.13]This is the beginning.
[128:28.01]Oh.
[128:30.43]It's Elephant Bomb.
[128:56.86]This should be fun.
[129:04.07]What happened to the first hour?
[129:07.21]I got framed for something I didn't do.
[129:09.30]And they made lore based around how bad of a person I was and how evil I was.
[129:13.54]Those people have since taken over the world.
[129:17.60]And now I need to come back and take it over.
[129:20.85]And tell everybody that they're bad people.
[129:22.93]I think.
[129:23.19]I don't know.
[129:35.13]Ooh, living as a telegraph system.
[129:39.59]Merrick, Merrick, Merrick, Merrick, Merrick, Merrick.
[129:48.04]Got it.
[129:49.10]Why am I fighting the elephant?
[129:51.42]Oh, why not?
[129:56.15]Which leg?
[129:59.23]Aw, what?
[130:15.31]Yeah, this is some entity.
[130:17.15]There's an entity.
[130:19.87]These are entities.
[130:21.47]They're called gomas.
[130:22.37]And they're apparently, I don't know, evil or something.
[130:25.36]Or they're part of the world.
[130:26.82]They're inside the world.
[130:27.70]Inside the crust.
[130:28.74]Inside the Earth's crust.
[130:30.60]The core.
[130:31.04]There's like lava enemies.
[130:32.06]And I don't know.
[130:33.12]We'll find out.
[130:41.17]They're demons.
[130:41.61]Yeah, the demons that live inside the planet or something and we're trying to stop them from coming out and killing everybody.
[130:55.04]How am I gonna get hit by that?
[130:56.65]Something pissed off about that one.
[131:03.45]Alright, let's end this.
[131:06.69]Almost time.
[131:09.89]Shoot it!
[131:10.55]Wait, what do you mean, shoot it?
[131:16.94]Can I just shoot?
[131:19.72]Oh.
[131:19.82]What a good idea that is.
[131:22.48]No, look, I can't shoot it anymore.
[131:26.96]Now it's in.
[131:29.72]Here we go.
[131:30.10]Let's do the worst.
[131:39.95]One tusk down.
[131:40.89]Alright, now what?
[132:07.84]Alright, part two.
[132:10.45]What's that?
[132:10.93]Holy shit!
[132:12.98]Okay.
[132:13.88]Well, that happens very quickly.
[132:22.46]He goes up, and then... Okay, here it comes.
[132:26.81]He goes up, and then... nope.
[132:30.25]It does it two times in a row?
[132:31.51]Oh, fuck!
[132:35.01]Oh my god, I don't know the timing on it.
[132:36.76]I'm gonna die.
[132:40.56]Oh, damn it.
[132:47.26]I think it doesn't... This one's easy to avoid.
[132:58.79]Does he just pick a side and just get away from that side?
[133:00.87]Oh my fucking god, I'm... Yeah, you just have to get away from the side that it's on.
[133:05.57]Huh?
[133:23.76]Alright.
[133:31.68]Ah, that's not building.
[133:35.36]That doesn't build any pressure.
[133:36.64]Whatever the hell I'm trying to do.
[133:37.72]What was that?
[133:39.50]Oh god.
[133:42.64]What the fuck?
[133:44.70]Oh, it's dodged through it.
[133:53.44]This game had an anime, did it?
[133:57.44]I just lost 50% of my HP.
[134:00.27]That's what happens when you read a chatroom when you're supposed to be playing a game.
[134:04.21]God damn it.
[134:06.73]Am I streaming right now?
[134:29.46]What the fuck?
[134:31.40]Where the hell am I?
[134:36.40]Oh.
[134:36.82]I'm gonna die again.
[134:40.53]Come here.
[134:55.41]Does this do extra damage now?
[134:59.83]Press LT.
[135:00.27]Yeah, but I can't hit him or anything.
[135:01.66]Do you want me just to punch him now?
[135:04.86]I mean, I can't.
[135:06.64]Where's he going?
[135:10.62]This way.
[135:12.66]Oh my fucking god.
[135:13.90]Did he just jump?
[135:22.95]It's hard to tell which side he's gonna pick.
[135:26.53]Oh god, here we go.
[135:27.43]He's gonna do this stupid beam.
[135:29.55]Let's do it twice?
[135:32.51]Stay in the middle?
[135:53.43]I can't get hit.
[135:54.11]I can't get hit.
[135:54.69]I can't get hit.
[135:55.33]I can't get hit.
[135:55.85]I can't get hit.
[135:56.33]Don't get hit.
[135:56.71]Don't get hit.
[135:57.11]Don't get hit.
[135:57.53]Don't get hit.
[135:57.93]Don't get hit.
[135:58.31]Don't get hit.
[135:58.72]How long is it gonna do this for?
[136:00.32]How long are you gonna do this for?
[136:07.06]What's this?
[136:08.16]New move?
[136:12.66]Alright, come on.
[136:13.96]Just don't get hit.
[136:39.00]I'm fine.
[136:46.84]Which side is he going to do?
[136:51.12]I don't know.
[136:54.18]What's this?
[136:54.70]Oh, come on.
[137:04.66]Shoot him?
[137:05.18]I can't.
[137:05.87]I can't.
[137:09.33]Come on.
[137:09.87]Alright, dash.
[137:10.85]Dash at me.
[137:23.76]Done.
[137:26.80]First.
[137:29.24]First.
[137:34.72]What the fuck just happened?
[137:35.98]Oh yeah, this cut is easy.
[137:39.22]It's too nerve-wracking.
[137:49.12]Forgot they were QTEs.
[137:50.26]No, I didn't forget.
[137:51.10]I just wanted to see what you guys were saying.
[137:54.68]Why did I miss those?
[137:55.38]Because I looked to the left.
[137:57.84]And there's a chat room over here.
[138:01.11]And I go, what did somebody say?
[138:02.23]Whoops.
[138:03.45]Missed the QTEs.
[138:25.39]Control yourself!
[138:27.03]Where did this guy even come from?
[138:32.05]Immersing oneself in battle like that... Well done, Asura!
[138:40.86]Now that you have something to protect, why are you so full of rage?
[138:45.98]Or perhaps... That is exactly why.
[138:52.40]Something to protect?
[138:54.68]Nonsense!
[138:56.89]The only reason one needs to fight is the fight itself!
[139:02.13]That is so like you, Master.
[139:03.85]They all have big hands.
[139:05.59]We have cleared this area of Goma.
[139:08.15]Let us return to Shinkoku.
[139:10.91]Oh, why are they all elephants?
[139:19.61]Is there something in the lore as to why they're elephants?
[139:43.77]Mithra, your father has returned.
[139:46.03]Welcome home, dear.
[139:50.87]Thanks.
[139:53.61]Giant enemy baby.
[139:55.19]So, that is what he must protect?
[140:08.64]Yes, though you may not understand why.
[140:18.54]Easy whoa I'm just so angry.
[140:26.52]Please take it.
[140:28.06]Oh and he just turns around just fucking punches a wall Durga brother He almost looks scared of her
[140:41.25]He just doesn't know what to do when she starts crying Then he should pacify her Him?
[141:11.61]Kind of an abrupt cut.
[141:19.71]Move.
[141:22.95]Not bad, Asura.
[141:25.51]That uncontrollable rage of yours suits you well.
[141:41.24]see what I mean and I didn't do anything you just told everybody to move and I said move but they didn't join us should we work together we could more effectively exterminate the gold test me
[142:01.31]You are aware Mithra is the only suitable vessel to become priestess.
[142:06.77]Raise her with care, incompetent as you may be.
[142:10.79]Well, now I know.
[142:19.06]Now I know why.
[142:22.50]Well, you certainly are incompetent.
[142:26.58]I wager that is one of your more charming features.
[142:31.44]at least we know now the source of the flame that burns in your soul in other words you stop what was that I can't kill the spider hey lois remember that time I fought the goma
[143:03.28]Crying?
[143:04.42]What do you mean?
[143:05.14]I'm not crying.
[143:06.36]That was kind of funny.
[143:14.91]He's a little Lois.
[143:17.37]-2 Family Guy joke.
[143:19.11]No, come on.
[143:20.11]That's like kind of funny.
[143:21.23]That's kind of funny.
[143:23.10]Even though the eight guardian generals is no match for his own daughter, is he?
[143:28.00]That was humorous.
[143:30.70]She's so small.
[143:35.43]Do you know what I think?
[143:37.63]I believe that you only wish the best for our daughter.
[143:49.91]Alright, just grab the end of his web and like slurp it, like suck it up like spaghetti.
[144:07.57]Every time we're down here, I talk about killing this thing.
[144:10.44]I don't know why.
[144:35.39]What?
[145:04.70]Uh, that's kind of fucked up.
[145:11.44]You were in lava, yeah.
[145:12.88]I mean, you're gonna just leave me like that?
[145:29.51]Father's Duty, Episode 7.
[145:37.37]Was that part of the elephant, or what?
[145:39.15]Okay, maybe it was.
[145:41.37]Keep going.
[145:51.24]We continued Omega Lull.
[145:54.64]Omega Lull.
[146:03.09]Asura's residence thousands of years earlier.
[146:07.31]Seems that you made quite an impression in the last battle.
[146:09.27]Is that so?
[146:10.61]Heathrow was praying for you the whole time.
[146:13.25]Did you hear my prayers, Father?
[146:15.82]I did.
[146:16.98]I felt your presence with me and thought of you the whole time.
[146:20.76]So you didn't think about me at all, hmm?
[146:23.70]No, I meant... Oh, Father.
[146:25.30]He he he.
[146:33.20]General Asura, the next priestess has been chosen.
[146:37.94]General Asura's daughter, Mithra, is to be priestess.
[146:40.19]Congratulations, General.
[146:43.25]I can do better than that.
[146:54.46]I will not allow it.
[146:56.28]Father, but why?
[146:57.16]I will not have you become a tool for war.
[147:01.36]If it will give me the power to protect you, I will gladly become priestess.
[147:05.65]But...
[147:07.84]Aethra is gifted with the power to save the world.
[147:10.14]She could be the key in eradicating the Goma.
[147:13.18]Shut up!
[147:14.70]Asura, wait!
[147:15.98]Where are you going?
[147:18.37]Asura.
[147:27.39]Can't see that.
[147:30.13]Can't have that be spoiled.
[147:39.27]Animation and touch-up.
[147:42.23]Cyber connect 2.
[147:43.37]I just want to see cyber connect 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, all different episodes.
[147:47.99]No.
[148:05.18]I can do it too.
[148:06.10]You know I can.
[148:07.56]You know I can do that exact thing that's happening right now.
[148:10.18]You know I can do it.
[148:20.63]You know I'm capable of it.
[148:23.41]I'm having... I am using a lot of control right now to not do that.
[148:41.30]I wanna do it so bad.
[148:42.80]If it was me alone, I'd be doing it over and over again for like the next hour.
[148:47.63]If I wasn't on stream, I would seriously be sitting here just going... And I would do it for an hour.
[148:55.41]And then Kim would come in here and be like, what the fuck are you doing?
[149:13.91]His arms are back.
[149:19.89]Oh, don't be such a baby.
[149:21.55]Arms grow back.
[149:23.77]That's one of my favorite lines from any video game cutscene.
[149:41.32]It's delivered so perfectly.
[149:45.76]Wait, what?
[150:24.27]Oh, now look what you did.
[150:25.25]Now you woke up the baby.
[150:26.27]You know how long it took?
[150:29.34]You know how long it took to get them to go to sleep?
[150:33.12]Wait.
[150:33.46]Wait.
[150:33.76]Okay.
[150:51.19]Alright, bye.
[150:55.55]Is this supposed to be a lap?
[151:00.32]I think that was a lap.
[151:09.24]We have forward progress in this level, not just an arena.
[151:13.74]There's somebody behind me too.
[151:26.19]Jet?
[151:31.23]Jet.
[151:35.51]This is the Sonic Unleashed Werewolf levels.
[151:39.15]God damn it.
[151:40.14]Why did you have to just say that?
[151:47.20]That is so accurate.
[151:49.68]Why did you have to ruin this whole game for me?
[151:59.37]Didn't he hold a baby?
[152:04.21]Don't hit the baby!
[152:12.95]Watch out, watch out for the Mario Kart banana.
[152:14.73]Actually, I can't even hit this dude.
[152:38.04]Get him!
[153:08.13]I know a lot of you thought I was going to fail that on purpose to see what happens, but no.
[153:11.77]I want the good grade.
[153:20.86]Jesus.
[153:22.02]Almost squasher.
[153:40.37]There.
[153:40.93]Uh-oh.
[153:41.33]You go first.
[153:46.51]He's like a turtle.
[153:48.82]Here we go.
[153:55.00]Goma's Washer.
[153:57.54]Uh... Does it run?
[154:01.75]Kind of.
[154:02.51]Pistols?
[154:05.69]Yeah.
[154:08.74]Can I fire?
[154:09.22]Can I shoot?
[154:09.52]In the head?
[154:11.24]Yep.
[154:14.19]Oh, it's... Contra.
[154:16.31]Contra for the Super Nintendo.
[154:19.59]Contra for the Super Nintendo.
[154:21.27]The turtle where you hit the head and the head goes like... Holy shit, it's the same thing.
[154:23.71]Yep.
[154:23.81]It's actually not really working as well as I want it to.
[154:39.92]Alright, yeah, turn into the stomach.
[154:51.33]Back it up.
[154:54.69]Oh!
[154:57.71]That was probably exceptionally painful.
[155:06.28]Oh, does it keep going around?
[155:07.66]No, we're good.
[155:08.44]Right in the head.
[155:14.94]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[155:23.83]I don't know what that means.
[155:27.17]What's that?
[155:28.55]Ads?
[155:29.05]Yep.
[155:31.53]You just summoned him, man.
[155:34.35]You just summoned him.
[155:41.73]Ow.
[155:47.22]It's a charge.
[155:50.90]Just kill your own friends.
[155:52.98]Oh, fuck.
[155:57.17]Take his ass.
[156:16.51]Ooh, he's doing the spin.
[156:17.97]No!
[156:18.51]He just double tapped me.
[156:19.37]Don't triple tap me.
[156:21.27]Alright, I'm good.
[156:31.02]What are you going to do?
[156:34.84]Charge?
[156:35.26]Nope.
[156:40.42]Alright, settle down.
[156:47.60]LT is immunity, is it really?
[156:48.92]Didn't know that.
[156:53.63]Can you do a tail whip?
[157:07.15]Oh my fucking god.
[157:09.29]Oh my god.
[157:10.19]Oh my god.
[157:11.39]Oh my god.
[157:13.93]What the fuck happened?
[157:14.71]What have I done?
[157:15.15]I almost got instantly killed.
[157:18.18]This... God damn it.
[157:20.08]I wish I knew that.
[157:20.82]I almost couldn't do anything.
[157:31.33]Out, out, out, out, out.
[157:44.48]Fuck!
[158:23.33]What?
[158:36.99]The frames, yeah.
[158:37.97]They're not very good, are they?
[158:46.83]this is on Xbox 360.
[159:09.35]What language are they speaking?
[159:11.43]English?
[159:11.69]Septentrion.
[159:43.08]This is madness.
[160:04.95]So this is the reason for the unusual mantra concentration in these parts.
[160:09.89]This guy's on a single wheel?
[160:12.53]Oh, okay.
[160:23.46]The magical wheel.
[160:25.10]Of course it is.
[160:29.19]I wonder what that guy's fight's gonna be like.
[160:36.09]Oh.
[160:38.18]It's happening right now.
[160:39.20]I don't have to wonder anymore.
[160:42.50]I shall guide you to heaven.
[161:09.60]Boss?
[161:09.94]No?
[161:11.20]No boss?
[161:12.14]Uhh...
[161:32.50]Why'd you kill that guy?
[161:34.00]What?
[161:35.62]What?
[162:04.13]This guy's playing black and white.
[162:11.67]That's his... That's his creature.
[162:16.19]He turns over and he's like, stop doing that!
[162:19.29]No!
[162:21.33]Puts a leash on him.
[162:27.71]I had the... God dammit, I had the destruction leash on!
[162:31.73]Even pointed too, he was like, point.
[162:35.58]Let's look at this baby.
[163:03.59]Rock music.
[163:05.03]What the hell are you doing?
[163:06.59]There's the fucking machine gun sound.
[163:17.10]There's some battle going on somewhere with guns.
[163:30.09]I will not stand for this.
[163:34.34]I know what this is.
[163:37.56]There are no guns in this game, it just sounds like it.
[163:40.20]Can you please switch to the Japanese voiceover?
[163:50.91]It's better.
[163:52.89]It's too late.
[164:02.84]I've already become invested in the characters while they speak up.
[164:12.28]Dodged it.
[164:19.95]Right in the face.
[164:26.17]Break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break, break.
[164:32.30]Oh, I hit him with that too.
[164:38.56]Aw, what?
[164:47.27]Aw, shit.
[164:48.05]Where is he?
[165:06.47]Sonic Unleashed.
[165:09.59]I can't get over it.
[165:19.13]Why did that person have to say that?
[165:23.87]Oh fuck, that hurt.
[165:25.14]Oh wait, there's another mini-boss here.
[165:36.22]Shit!
[165:38.46]Oh shit.
[165:39.12]Sorry.
[165:41.08]Oh boy.
[165:43.62]I don't even know what the hell's going on.
[165:47.70]I'm invincible though.
[165:53.54]Come on.
[165:57.56]Alright, this is it.
[166:07.83]What are you guys saying?
[166:20.50]What are you guys doing?
[166:30.07]You go tell who's responsible for this.
[166:32.55]That I'm coming for him.
[166:34.31]Alright?
[166:42.74]Can I not do it?
[166:48.32]What if I don't want to?
[166:49.26]Can I not do it?
[166:50.02]What?
[166:53.30]What?
[167:14.04]Now what?
[167:14.44]Uh-oh.
[167:17.33]She's learning.
[167:21.99]That's not good.
[167:22.61]I'm not putting a good example out.
[167:25.99]She's got a rock in her hand.
[167:27.38]Holy shit.
[167:36.50]She's learning from you.
[167:37.96]You're the god.
[167:44.38]You're the reason humans are like this.
[167:46.12]No, I'm not.
[167:54.41]Stop, stop, stop.
[167:56.25]Enough.
[167:58.23]Use two hands.
[167:59.85]You get more leverage that way.
[168:12.20]I know how you feel.
[168:23.98]Black and white too sure is weird.
[168:34.14]Where's the baby?
[168:34.70]Yeah, where's the baby?
[168:38.27]You.
[168:49.33]You let me handle them.
[168:58.97]Baby got League of Legends ganked.
[169:02.49]I kind of know what you mean by that, but I don't at the same time.
[169:05.47]I don't know what that means, sort of.
[169:06.81]I don't know what that means.
[169:10.57]I mean, I kind of do.
[169:12.44]Not really.
[169:18.78]Villager B. Episode 8, Willing Sacrifices.
[169:24.26]Alright.
[169:25.89]Let's go.
[169:38.29]village on the outskirts of shinkoku here within this stone lies remains of the fallen demigod who defied the seven deities long ago he succeeded in killing one of them at the cost of his own following the divine battle the remaining deities abandoned this land declared a curse for all eternity it is believed the fallen demigod continues to watch over this land
[170:01.22]but the Goma rarely appear in these parts.
[170:03.98]For this reason, the villagers enshrine his remains and worship from afar, but do not dare approach the shrine out of fear.
[170:17.05]There was one little girl, however, who regularly came to the shrine and offered flowers to the fallen demigod.
[170:23.06]Long ago, when she and her father went off to a nearby village, they were attacked by the Goma.
[170:27.74]Just when they thought their lives were over, the seven deities came from the heavens and purified the Goma.
[170:33.26]The little girl was deeply relieved that the deities have saved them.
[170:42.61]However, the deities did not only purify the Goma, and thus many humans were caught in the fires of their purification.
[170:49.51]The girl's father was one of those who perished.
[170:52.96]But rather than defy the deities for their tyranny, the villagers saw it as an honor.
[170:57.76]They rejoiced that the deities would lead their souls to heaven and gladly gave their lives.
[171:03.15]The girl walked, hopeless and full of despair, until she stumbled upon the shrine of the fallen demigod.
[171:09.39]As the old tale said, the stone had an aura of anger, yet the girl was not afraid.
[171:15.47]Somewhere in the fallen demigod's face she saw a resemblance to her late father.
[171:20.19]Since then, the girl has been visiting the shrine to offer flowers.
[171:30.98]Everyone did nothing but pray, but he took action.
[171:35.80]Oh, this is not a narrator.
[171:37.14]Wait for me, I'm coming with you!
[171:40.18]Jerma, are you the CEO of Jerma Incorporated?
[171:54.69]Um, no.
[171:58.18]I mean, I guess you could say, like, sure.
[171:59.88]Sure, yes.
[172:00.66]I guess.
[172:03.82]You're doing the infomercial voice.
[172:05.76]Yeah, because it's the narrator.
[172:21.58]You let me handle them Let's do the CEO the best laid plans episode nine That's pretty that's cool
[173:06.45]God, I really hate the dummy ship sections.
[173:11.95]And you can't skip them either.
[173:24.92]Getting angry
[173:40.64]Actually, it would have been pretty nice to be able to get Chip and Dale to get angry.
[173:46.46]They just had to press a button and skip the sequence.
[173:49.52]Actually, not that bad.
[173:55.85]Oh, we got over six arms now.
[174:07.92]-2.
[174:08.48]Nobody likes Kingdom Hearts.
[174:11.74]I just made fun of Kingdom Hearts.

[174:14.10]I liked Kingdom Hearts 1 and 2 a little, I guess.
[174:27.91]I liked Kingdom Hearts 1.
[174:46.76]I don't really remember to.
[174:59.81]Alright, I'm in the ship.
[175:02.25]Let's go.
[175:03.61]I'm not the one who started this fire.
[175:08.02]It's pretty much the same thing I said.
[175:09.52]Have to do some firing in the sky.
[175:36.08]Alright.
[175:44.49]Oh, come on.
[175:46.05]What am I aiming at here?
[175:48.67]What am I aiming at?
[175:50.19]At this?

[179:34.18]I just didn't know when.
[179:38.80]Enough people liked Marvel for it now to be... Stupid wave.
[179:45.14]Enough people started to watch Captain America.

[180:32.59]Oh my god, I'm instantly dead.
[180:37.72]Oh!
[180:37.98]I didn't time it correctly.
[180:49.29]Oh shit, it starts all the way back here.
[180:50.79]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[180:54.47]That's the thing with the nature of, like, the internet.
[180:57.67]Alright, so back in the day it used to be... If you had a group of maybe, like, eight people you ever communicated with back, like, 20 years ago, you would call somebody on a landline to, like, talk to them.
[181:11.43]And no, no one was gonna call your landline to be like, hey, Marvel movies are stupid.
[181:16.66]But now, there's so many opinions.
[181:22.03]Like, you didn't get random prank calls.
[181:24.39]People dialing random numbers going, Hey, by the way, Spider-Man's dumb.
[181:29.71]You'd be like, who the fuck is this?
[181:31.24]Spy!
[181:34.72]That didn't happen.
[181:53.77]You talked to like eight people ever.
[181:58.67]Your mom, your dad, the person who lived across the street from you, and like two people you went to school with.
[182:07.85]And if one of them didn't like Spider-Man, well, okay.
[182:16.00]Or, yeah, like siblings.
[182:19.44]Now, you can hear from anybody on Earth.
[182:22.10]Any of their opinions.
[182:23.47]Instantly.
[182:23.97]Right now.
[182:25.01]Like, right now, there's 5,000 people here.
[182:28.85]You guys can give your opinions on anything.
[182:31.93]And we could just have a huge discussion about the world in movies.
[182:36.69]And half of you would hate the other half.
[182:39.11]Because they don't like Spider-Man.
[182:53.53]I hate the other half.
[183:05.96]Alright, I can't die here.
[183:10.64]This is important.
[183:14.61]Come here, come here, come here, kill it, kill it!

[183:54.78]Nah, neither do I.
[184:03.36]Can I build up shit with this?
[184:04.24]Is he going to keep walking?
[184:06.20]Oh my god, he just gave me a free kill.
[184:07.46]Is he hitting me?
[184:20.47]He better not be.
[184:28.77]Oh, come on.

[186:09.47]Oh, is that his mouth?
[186:41.81]Alright, here comes boss.
[186:46.69]Alright, is it weird that I want to eat his hair?
[186:57.31]Is this weird?
[187:05.31]Alright.
[187:12.23]Those are the mortal souls that have been harvested into Mantra.
[187:17.67]And these ships guide them to heaven.
[187:22.47]You son of a bitch!
[187:26.02]Where did he... what?

[189:23.51]Come on!
[189:24.68]He's dead?
[189:26.12]He is dead.
[189:26.68]Shit.
[189:33.30]What the fuck are these things doing?
[189:38.43]I just think they're freaking me out.
[189:40.17]Do they explode?
[189:52.51]Holy shit, they dodged me.
[190:06.22]Come on.
[190:14.96]I need to hit one person.
[190:18.62]One person.
[190:19.16]Let's go.
[190:19.86]Come on.
[190:21.07]Why?
[190:21.47]What?
[190:23.45]I can't do first.
[190:24.19]Why not?
[190:26.15]Why not?
[190:26.87]Come on.
[190:37.11]Jesus!
[190:37.63]Walk to the door.
[190:42.48]What?
[190:43.30]What do you mean, walk to the door?
[191:07.24]No?
[191:08.12]I have to kill this guy.
[191:12.14]Yeah?
[191:12.80]Alright.
[191:15.66]I have a preemptive burst?
[191:18.70]Oh.
[191:19.66]Now I have to use burst on door.
[191:21.44]Okay.
[191:36.79]Carl's back.
[191:40.35]Of course it's an elevator sequence.
[191:48.12]Holy shit.
[192:04.82]We have to have a fucking elevator sequence.
[192:12.68]Elevator sequences are universal.
[192:14.54]I don't have health now.
[192:16.90]There's no health in this game either.
[192:22.09]Ugh.
[192:34.51]Don't kill me.
[192:35.11]Fuck!
[192:35.53]You dead?
[192:37.31]Yep.
[192:37.53]Sorry, I gotta move.
[192:42.65]Wait, what's going on?
[192:46.07]Okay.
[193:00.25]He's running around like a spider.
[193:01.41]Yeah, kind of.
[193:02.07]Ooh, yup.
[193:12.27]Here we go.
[193:16.58]Dead.
[193:16.98]Not dead.
[193:17.40]Still alive.
[193:34.01]Oh, come on.
[193:36.95]Did I actually just get killed in one hit there?
[193:38.49]I thought he was dead.
[193:40.85]I have to do the whole fucking elevator again.
[193:54.64]Die.
[193:55.12]I'm tired.
[193:55.70]I'm so tired.
[194:04.14]Don't even let him go.
[194:05.95]Don't even let him go.
[194:06.77]Don't even let him go.
[194:11.65]Skip to the boss?
[194:12.49]Kind of impossible.
[194:14.65]We'll play the game first.
[194:16.23]Alright, who's next?
[194:18.28]Here it comes.
[194:20.00]1, 2, 3.
[194:20.32]Alright, these guys.
[194:21.48]Stuck in the corner.
[194:34.60]Alright.
[194:47.83]This is where I fucked up last time.
[194:50.97]I'm ready.
[194:51.30]1, 2, 3, drop.
[194:58.95]More points, more points, points points points.
[195:07.21]Okay - I'm gonna hold the super.
[195:20.81]Do it again.
[195:25.81]Again?
[195:29.39]Alright, how many fucking times do I have to do this?
[195:35.44]I got to do the ROT to this guy.
[195:42.44]Alright yeah yeah yeah yeah. Here we go.
[195:45.44]Turn of the game please.
[195:47.44]Uh okay yeah sure.
[195:59.06]When I'm done.
[196:19.21]It's the stock alarm.
[196:20.63]Alright, let's go.
[196:21.47]How could one man destroy my entire fleet?
[196:30.49]Are you done yet?
[196:32.54]No, not yet.
[196:33.74]Did you think I would subject myself to your primitive way of combat?
[196:46.72]Is that another hologram?
[196:47.74]Come on.
[196:48.33]Farewell, officer.
[197:13.71]So I have the DLC I don't have the DLC I didn't know I needed the DLC to beat the game I
[197:34.86]Okay, this fight's probably going to be me rip him out and just snap his neck.
[197:37.58]I don't think this is going to be a big epic boss fight, guys.
[197:42.02]I think I'm just going to break this guy's neck.
[198:09.99]Oh, I'm crushing him?
[198:11.07]Turn him into paste.
[198:12.51]That's the plan!
[198:41.36]Oh, I actually, I knew that wasn't going to be a big fight.
[198:46.34]Yeah, I just crushed his head.
[198:47.43]Wait, am I going to be broken apart again?
[199:11.22]Finally a use for a shitty emote.
[199:19.39]I know who this guy is at this point.
[199:22.51]You don't have to keep telling me.
[199:48.24]Who is this guy?
[199:52.84]Uh... August?
[199:54.46]August.
[199:55.06]Yeah.
[199:56.78]August?
[199:59.12]Episode 9.
[200:01.50]In the books.
[200:02.74]D. Hey, how do I get D on top?
[200:05.26]Because I restarted, right?
[200:16.42]But didn't somebody say there were 13 episodes?
[200:18.42]I'm almost done.
[200:21.34]Let's go.
[200:21.72]18 episodes.
[200:34.49]Well, alright, let's fucking go.
[200:35.61]We're at number 10.
[200:36.65]Number 9.
[200:39.40]Seems Calvary has lost as well.
[200:41.15]So even our resident tactician with the elaborate stratagems.
[200:45.41]There's no match for the monkey's brute strength.
[200:47.11]How unfortunate.
[200:49.58]This cannot go on any further.
[200:50.74]We should gather our forces and attack him at all at once.
[200:53.00]Let's go.
[200:54.14]Wait.
[200:55.04]With our fleet's firepower, we risk causing immeasurable damage to the land.
[201:00.58]It's hardly a time to be merciful.
[201:01.76]He must be dealt with at once.
[201:02.88]That last boss fight, come on.
[201:05.10]It was just the guy, I crushed his head.
[201:06.84]I squished his head in between two pieces of metal.
[201:09.74]That wasn't as cool as the first one.
[201:13.78]Now, now, let's not get hasty.
[201:15.04]It's in such bad taste.
[201:16.20]I'm sure August would be more than happy to take our little care of our problem.
[201:20.56]Fine, where is he?
[201:21.17]What could he be doing?
[201:21.79]Alright, we're gonna fight August.
[201:24.15]Where do you think he is?
[201:26.41]Asura has def-
[201:32.10]This next one is really, really good.
[201:33.50]Okay.
[201:38.69]This fight is amazing.
[201:39.79]This is the best part.
[201:42.23]Well, let's go.
[201:47.71]This next one is my favorite.
[201:50.46]Ooh, you're setting this up here.
[201:51.86]What?
[202:04.64]Here we go.
[202:07.66]Words of wisdom.
[202:08.76]What?
[202:09.66]Why is he... Oh yeah, I have these.
[202:27.55]Arms.
[202:28.65]I forgot.
[202:29.61]It's like a baby realizing he has fingers and hands.
[202:35.66]Then eat good food.
[202:37.28]You fight.
[202:38.36]Then drink fine wine.
[202:40.10]You fight.
[202:41.08]Then sleep with beautiful women.
[202:43.35]Hell, fight with beautiful women.
[202:47.77]That is what it means to live.
[202:49.53]Hobbit music.
[202:56.79]I am not like you.
[202:58.47]It kind of was.
[202:59.15]I didn't say anything about it.
[203:00.99]It's a Lord of the Rings reference.
[203:03.43]And people might be angry at me.
[203:07.57]But it kinda does.
[203:08.35]Is this raided?
[203:13.43]Where's that box?
[203:14.91]This is raided.
[203:16.39]Alright, this is tea for tea.
[203:17.47]We're fine.
[203:29.11]What?
[203:30.01]Why are we in a field?
[203:39.71]Wait, what?
[203:40.67]Let's go!
[203:42.02]I don't fuck around!
[203:52.88]Splash?
[203:53.52]Splash who?
[203:57.02]That's a dick move.
[204:08.30]Okay, so...
[204:10.48]Look around.
[204:11.00]Oh, what's he doing?
[204:13.80]Who the fuck is that?
[204:15.04]Hey!
[204:15.30]Alright, what's he doing?
[204:21.92]Hey!
[204:22.16]I'll do that too.
[204:26.07]Okay.
[204:29.43]Now what are you doing?
[204:41.88]That's pretty good cat puke.
[204:43.16]Alright, what about just regular drink?
[204:46.17]Oh, there's a different one here.
[204:57.75]What does stand up do?
[205:03.74]Does it show how big I am?
[205:04.94]Uh...
[205:25.24]Alright, I filled my meter.
[205:27.02]Why splash?
[205:29.26]I don't know.
[205:30.26]That's an option.
[205:33.12]No, I'm not ready yet.
[205:33.92]I'm not ready yet.
[205:54.59]Does it keep going?
[205:56.28]This is getting worse.
[205:57.20]I have another.
[206:08.89]I can't even move.
[206:10.23]Alright.
[206:11.27]Burst.
[206:13.81]Stand up.
[206:22.35]Alright, it's burst time.
[206:28.60]What?
[206:31.40]Oh my fucking god.
[206:32.70]This is T. This is T for team.
[206:34.96]God damn it.
[206:36.56]What?
[206:43.02]Why is he naked?
[206:43.78]This just says T on the box!
[206:58.78]And it's teen.
[206:59.44]Don't be a soccer mom.
[207:00.18]What?
[207:00.74]I didn't do anything.
[207:01.54]The Great Rebirth.
[207:22.87]They're all too dependent on Mantra.
[207:25.95]That is why Wyzen and Kalra were so weak.
[207:29.23]Don't be a sucker, Mom.
[207:32.42]They are unsatisfying.
[207:33.86]Things were different before.
[207:37.56]Yes.
[207:39.08]We used to fight side by side.
[207:41.28]Those were the days.
[207:43.56]Do you remember when we did this?
[207:47.91]Let's go back and find out.
[207:52.18]Viewers went up by about two or three hundred viewers during that segment, by the way.
[207:56.98]Your minds are just in the gutter.
[207:59.24]Come on.
[208:08.27]What do you mean, the thumbnail?
[208:32.70]That's fine.
[208:33.36]The thumbnail's fine.
[208:37.23]The guy looking at the moon.
[208:45.70]Ow.
[208:50.84]It's not the- I just looked at- I just looked.
[208:52.34]It's not there.
[209:02.23]It's not there?
[209:08.96]Look at that fake... Look at that fake image of a doctor coming.
[209:23.23]Projerma front page is a... No, it's definitely not.
[209:30.60]Recommended live channels.
[209:32.18]Yeah, but you- is that- that's- it might not be real though.
[209:37.71]Who's left?
[209:39.75]Oh, let's go this way.
[209:49.49]I'm going with Charger.
[209:54.79]Alright, let's do it.
[210:00.00]We're in Goma.
[210:01.22]Or Rhino.
[210:01.98]Okay.
[210:04.67]There's two of them?
[210:10.81]Fuck.
[210:11.65]Not good.
[210:14.95]I'm gonna dodge and then, uh, do a data punch.
[210:22.50]He's dead.
[210:22.98]Alright, good.
[210:23.60]Good.
[210:28.80]Dude, Nintendo in chat.
[210:33.10]Hey, welcome back.
[210:37.56]Alright, I have to stop paying attention to where you guys are going.
[210:40.95]Oh, listen.
[210:53.82]You're losing viewers.
[210:54.76]You have to do something about that.
[210:56.04]Well, they were here for one reason and I don't... Whatever.
[210:58.62]Oh shit.
[211:16.93]Well, I really should have used that now.
[211:22.99]Jesus.
[211:25.41]Oh my god.
[211:27.58]Come on, give it a chance.
[211:38.18]Alright, we're fine.
[211:39.86]I have no health, though.
[211:42.61]Here he comes.
[211:43.55]Go ahead and kill him.
[211:44.71]What was that weird... Okay, that was... Did you see that turn?
[211:47.75]That was like an instant turn.
[211:51.39]Instant turn.
[211:52.59]Hopefully it's right there.
[211:55.63]It's not.
[212:05.06]I can't knock him back?
[212:06.04]What?
[212:06.68]Hmm.
[212:08.17]Why could I not... What was I gonna say?
[212:11.07]I did like twice.
[212:16.56]Why is chat focused on everything but the game?
[212:28.00]Well, I think it's because...
[212:31.99]that sometimes like to do its own thing and just they go off on their own with random stuff.
[212:44.12]Tends to happen.
[212:53.72]Just because we're bored.
[212:57.52]I'll get some like Nickelodeon Gak and fucking play with it.
[213:16.77]Got it.
[213:18.47]No, don't you fucking dare screw this up.
[213:20.71]Thank you.
[213:27.23]Please be dead, please be dead, please be dead.
[213:29.29]It's not dead!
[213:30.43]It's not dead.
[213:31.27]Aye, aye, aye, where is it?
[213:36.54]I almost have enough.
[213:45.46]There it is.
[213:50.52]Good thing I'm invincible.
[214:01.53]Burst it.
[214:09.61]We saw boobs.
[214:10.25]It's over.
[214:12.73]He didn't
[214:15.71]You saw somebody in a bath.
[214:19.77]A big one.
[214:21.13]That's it.
[214:27.38]Another turtle?
[214:29.14]Oh, we've already seen the turtle.
[214:30.22]This is not a new enemy.
[214:45.81]I got hit by it.
[214:46.39]I got hit by the end of it.
[214:47.61]I don't want to get killed.
[214:55.07]He's still headed in the back.
[215:01.89]He's headed in the head.
[215:08.33]He's not doing anything.
[215:10.89]Giant enemy turtle.
[215:11.39]That's right.
[215:18.95]Dude, how the fuck am I supposed to avoid that?
[215:21.97]That seems unavoidable.
[215:28.40]Run?
[215:29.68]I just run away.
[215:30.54]I can't dodge it.
[215:35.14]Can I leave?
[215:38.54]Can you do something?
[215:42.60]No, it's jump.
[215:43.20]You gotta jump.
[215:54.37]Invincible, just spam.
[215:56.65]Spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam, spam.
[216:01.87]Just keep doing that.
[216:04.57]Doesn't matter, I'm invincible.
[216:11.95]Alright, watch out.
[216:30.01]He's learning.
[216:30.81]Yes, very slowly, but I am.
[216:32.61]Okay, we're good.
[216:42.06]If I could hit once, I'm dead, so that'd be very, very, very sad.
[216:48.74]What are you gonna do?
[216:50.61]Eh.
[216:59.43]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go,

[217:39.63]Oh, the other meter.
[217:42.09]Right, right, right.
[217:44.87]The LT meter.
[217:47.81]Well, in that case, let's do it.
[217:52.09]What's this?
[217:52.35]This kind of feels like cheating.
[218:07.28]Whoa!
[218:09.24]He just spawned a fucking Rhino.
[218:15.79]Why didn't he spawn a Rhino?
[218:19.87]It's alright, I'm still invincible.
[218:21.13]I'll get it.
[218:25.24]Come on, stop spinning!
[218:32.92]Stop spinning.
[218:38.64]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[218:50.70]Fuck, I need to watch the... Did I fall?
[218:52.74]I fell on both.
[218:53.22]I think I fell on both.
[218:56.09]I keep forgetting to... Whatever, I did it.
[219:00.79]Every time there's a cutscene, I go like, yeah, I got a minute, let's fuck over here.
[219:03.23]What are you guys saying about this thing?
[219:09.22]Because I have to focus the whole time I'm playing against the enemy.
[219:11.80]And I look over.
[219:12.36]Hey, what are you guys doing?
[219:15.14]How have you been, guys?
[219:19.42]Missing QTEs is just less points.
[219:22.48]Oh, that's alright then.
[219:33.55]Alright, at least this is different.
[219:35.75]What is this?
[219:37.69]A fish.
[219:41.96]Leave this to your master, Asura.
[219:43.50]I have not yet had my fill.
[219:47.36]You never taught me how to stop my fists.
[219:51.29]In that case... You get there first!
[219:58.97]Not fair.
[220:01.92]Who's fighting over who gets to kill... Okay, who gets to kill the giant fish monster?
[220:07.40]To be continued.
[220:08.16]Episode 11.
[220:16.78]Well, that was a pretty long dream I'm gonna go now You're fighting rhinos and elephants and shit in your dreams man, you gotta stop you gotta stop eating hamburgers at 11 o'clock
[220:49.26]That's a boomer joke.
[220:51.36]Well, I turned 35 this year.
[220:52.64]Get over it.
[220:53.54]It's gonna be more and more of that.
[220:57.37]I'm a fucking... I turned 35 in like three days.
[221:16.94]Now, episode 11.
[221:19.14]We actually get to fight this guy.
[221:26.61]They say Lord August has gone off to find the Fallen One.
[221:29.59]The traitor was Lord August's pupil, was he not?
[221:32.77]Yep.
[221:33.76]You think Lord August sympathizes with the Fallen One?
[221:37.02]You guys have seen Squidbillies, right?
[221:59.48]Who's the lady that lies down like this in Squidbillies?
[222:03.90]That is like... Earl's like wife?
[222:09.77]The same stance and... Her... What's his name?
[222:15.03]Hurley?
[222:17.07]Hurley.
[222:17.89]Yeah.
[222:21.02]I wouldn't be so sure Lord Wiseman and Lord Calro were defeated.
[222:24.22]Who is to say that Lord August will fare any better?
[222:30.55]Yes, sir.
[222:30.71]Awesome.
[223:03.80]I'm turning 21 in a couple of weeks.
[223:05.02]Do you have any good drink recommendations?
[223:08.10]Yeah?
[223:10.17]Do you like wine?
[223:11.41]Well, you don't know because you can't drink yet.
[223:14.61]You might.
[223:19.03]Wine's good.
[223:22.79]A good red wine.
[223:24.77]It has some good, fruity, deep flavors to it.
[223:28.25]Malbec is my favorite wine.
[223:30.59]Absolutely.
[223:34.17]Vodka Pineapple is also just perfect.
[223:38.79]This is the song!
[223:43.87]Alright, this is awesome.
[223:48.65]I'm fighting on the moon.
[223:56.88]Let's go.
[224:01.39]This is a great setting for a fight.
[224:03.57]Because there ain't shit on the moon, so there's plenty of room.
[224:10.61]Okay, well he just destroyed me.
[224:13.76]Oh my god.
[224:18.28]Oh my god.
[224:25.81]Oh, if I could hit him dead.
[224:35.55]I took all of my damage at the very beginning of the fight.
[224:37.72]That's great.
[224:39.84]Oh, boy.
[224:43.14]What's this?
[224:52.48]Hit it!
[224:55.39]What perfect fight music.
[225:04.05]Oh, fuck!
[225:04.87]I've just walked into it.
[225:06.31]Goddammit.
[225:15.76]Alright, now I know what's going on.
[225:18.22]two three four yes this is the hot is on hard is there a difficulty after hard
[225:37.47]Harder.
[225:37.93]Wow.
[225:38.23]This isn't too bad.
[225:44.51]It's really... I mean, you die in, like, three hits, but it's not too bad.
[225:48.73]This probably would have been too easy on normal.
[225:51.69]Not quite!
[225:55.13]He held it!
[226:06.17]What do you mean, do I lack critical information?
[226:10.23]Somehow?
[226:12.12]Why?
[226:18.99]Whatever that means.
[226:20.23]Okay.
[226:24.47]That's usually not a good sign.
[226:27.94]We got it.
[226:38.51]We got it, come on!
[226:40.57]Yes.
[226:40.87]Again?
[227:00.82]What's going on?
[227:01.37]Okay.
[227:07.97]Again.
[227:09.95]Again?
[227:13.06]This Dragon Ball fight is kind of ridiculous.
[227:17.16]Again?
[227:35.98]Uh-oh.
[227:39.88]I have had carnal knowledge of the fairest maidens in heaven.
[227:43.27]I have tasted the finest wines of Gaia.
[227:49.39]Here comes the sword.
[227:52.75]None of it.
[227:55.02]It shouts my blood more than using my blade.
[227:58.76]Ha ha ha!
[228:01.54]Prepare to meet your end, Ophelia!
[228:10.37]On the next episode.
[228:12.65]Is it going to do that to us?
[228:14.50]Head deity, Deus.
[228:15.34]You guys...
[228:38.25]Deus means God, by the way.
[228:42.31]Alright, cool.
[228:45.73]That's my favorite comment of the night.
[228:50.27]I love that comment.
[228:51.31]It's great.
[228:51.87]Oh boy.
[228:52.35]Oh, they caught it.
[228:54.03]Jesus.
[229:14.35]And... Whoa.
[229:17.79]Jump?
[229:19.04]Alright, I have to make it all the way to him?
[229:20.46]Yeah.
[229:20.90]Definitely.
[229:21.44]What the fuck is that?
[229:23.46]Whoa!
[229:23.74]Alright, we're good.
[229:26.00]No, we're not good.
[229:26.80]We're not good.
[229:27.18]He does it twice.
[229:31.89]Ah!
[229:35.43]Two... Just two swings.
[229:38.37]Fuck!
[229:41.10]Oh my god.
[229:42.10]It's fine.
[229:53.11]Holy shit, man.
[229:55.13]What the hell is this?
[229:56.63]Alright, now the music's distracting me.
[230:11.41]I had a wasted opportunity to hit him.
[230:13.27]Oh... Thank god it's not the whole fight.
[230:37.88]Shoot him.
[230:40.66]Three?
[230:45.66]Damn it, alright, yeah, he does three.
[230:48.29]Holy shit, what's happening?
[231:09.87]That made her Whatever To breathe Oh
[231:35.66]More, more, more, more, more.
[231:36.52]Get in, in, in, in, in, in, in.
[231:37.40]Alright, fine, just catch it.
[231:41.44]Alright, don't, I, don't blow this.
[231:46.02]Don't use it.
[231:48.04]Wait till he does, before he comes over to you.
[231:50.34]There we go.
[231:51.92]What?
[231:52.30]Oh, shit.
[231:52.72]He didn't do the thing I thought he was gonna do?
[231:59.62]Don't, don't, don't.
[232:00.38]I just need to... He's gonna dash?
[232:02.12]There it goes.
[232:06.12]one two three use it now I I used it and missed before
[232:24.89]But all good things must come to an end.
[232:27.99]You knew this was coming.
[232:33.95]This is an extra long sword.
[232:41.22]Expanding sword.
[232:43.70]Is it going to be this big for the rest of the fight?
[232:47.22]That should be pretty cool.
[232:49.94]He's got this huge hull.
[232:57.66]Oh god, I'm losing my arms again.
[233:05.97]What the fuck is going on?
[233:17.90]How can they still hear each other?
[233:22.30]There's a hole on either end of that sword.
[233:26.53]They're just putting their mouth up against the wall.
[233:33.52]And then he puts his ear up too so he can hear it.
[233:37.26]Flashback.
[233:59.23]Oh, another meteor.
[234:04.54]Must be Monday.
[234:18.37]This world is destroyed.
[234:29.28]If you can hang on for this long, just lift your body up and make it settle this forward motion.
[234:36.56]What the hell is he going to do then?
[234:37.50]Is he going to tip over and fall?
[234:39.82]Or fall forward?
[234:40.78]He made it.
[235:02.87]Did I get it?
[235:04.57]Harmless again.
[235:05.15]For the second time today.
[235:06.51]Yes.
[235:33.98]That was one hell of a battle.
[235:35.92]It's been 12,000 years since you've lost the arm.
[235:40.52]Where would that anger take you?
[235:42.64]Yeah, that's right.
[235:45.54]You're not me.
[235:48.68]Yet you continue to fight.
[235:50.30]Vadima.
[236:02.48]Anybody want a water or something?
[236:03.78]Can I get you guys anything?
[236:04.34]You know, I'd love, I'd just love a black coffee.
[236:08.64]You guys have that here?
[236:46.87]Black coffee -2.
[236:53.88]If you drink coffee at a diner, I always get a plus.
[236:57.72]Why is that -2?
[237:00.66]I drink black coffee at a diner.
[237:05.93]That's a big... That's a huge snake stegosaurus.
[237:14.87]Oh.
[237:22.37]Do we lose frames here?
[237:29.42]We good?
[237:29.78]I think we're good.
[237:36.82]Give it a refresh, maybe.
[237:37.84]It looks like we dropped something.
[237:44.69]Just walking like this.
[237:50.52]running away from her.
[238:06.17]Should be good now.
[238:09.23]A little all over the place, but it'll be alright.
[238:30.09]Well, turn and run the other way.
[238:32.01]This is when you turn and run the other way.
[238:45.90]Part 2, Rebirth, Episode 2.
[238:47.62]But what epi- Oh, no.
[238:48.56]No, no, no.
[238:49.50]That's- It's not Part 11.
[238:50.94]Part 11, Rebirth, Episode 11.
[238:53.26]It's not correct.
[238:55.37]They got the Roman numerals there.
[239:12.12]Viewers just jumped up like crazy.
[239:14.38]Did we get front page?
[239:17.76]That's a lot of people that just came in.
[239:18.83]Hi, guys.
[239:20.37]This has been no raid or anything.
[239:23.31]Is it a host from somewhere?
[239:24.21]Oh, hi.
[239:31.33]Oh, now they're all gone.
[239:38.68]That's the equivalent of, um, like, you called an elevator, and there's, like, fucking a shitload of people on the elevator when it opens, and then you just, you're just like, nah, no one's getting off, and just keep going.
[239:54.93]Just keep going.
[239:57.84]Like, oh, is this our floor?
[239:59.78]No, no, no.
[240:00.42]Someone pressed the button and there's not enough room.
[240:03.36]Ah, whatever.
[240:04.50]Bye, dickhead.
[240:04.96]A village on the outskirts of Shinkoku.
[240:15.01]In the plaza.
[240:17.77]No, why am I still alive?
[240:19.23]If I had only prayed more, perhaps then they would have accepted my soul.
[240:24.17]Why is my voice high-pitched?
[240:25.43]What?
[240:28.00]My voice is high-pitched?
[240:29.20]Retard.
[240:31.52]What?
[240:32.72]You're freaking me out.
[240:33.58]It's high?
[240:36.10]What?
[240:37.34]No, it's not.
[240:44.91]Look, look.
[240:45.91]Actually on...
[240:48.91]On the front page.
[240:50.05]Oh, well, yeah, that's cool.
[240:53.49]No, that's not the right, whatever.
[241:00.13]This was our chance to be guided to heaven.
[241:01.68]Oh, what are we to do now?
[241:03.48]We must pray.
[241:04.04]If we continue praying, they will surely guide our souls as well.
[241:10.06]What's wrong with all of you?
[241:11.44]Why do you do nothing but pray for death?
[241:13.96]This isn't right.
[241:14.54]I feel like I'm going to be sick.
[241:17.64]A high-pitched thing is an audio glitch.
[241:19.24]Refresh.
[241:20.94]You literally sound like a chipmunk.
[241:24.68]What are you talking about?
[241:25.86]I sound... I'm high-pitched?
[241:32.90]Just refresh your page.
[241:35.71]I need to leave this place.
[241:36.37]I don't want to be here anywhere but here.
[241:37.37]Episode 11.
[241:39.29]Zanora on episode 12.
[241:43.31]A little while later, barren field.
[241:45.97]What is that?
[241:47.57]Ah, that must be him.
[241:48.23]He's fighting in the heavens again.
[241:49.31]It can't be Agoma.
[241:56.07]Agoma aren't born from the heavens.
[241:57.28]It has to be him.
[241:59.74]I won't just wait here and pray.
[242:01.10]I have to make it there.
[242:06.34]I have to get to his battle.
[242:14.86]It's a mobile app bug, though.
[242:17.50]Ah, whatever.
[242:17.84]A few days after the mysterious explosion.
[242:37.31]It turns a stone.
[242:47.44]I just keep dying, huh?
[243:00.09]Well, gods of death.
[243:05.19]I'm winking.
[243:08.97]How do you know my name?
[243:20.11]Okay, has she only seen me with no arms?
[243:24.55]I think this is the only impression I've ever had on this person.
[243:27.29]Hey.
[243:27.69]What's up?
[243:47.38]You're so blue.
[243:48.67]Yeah, because I just plugged the mic in.
[243:51.41]I mean, I plugged the webcam in just to be able to do that.
[243:57.23]I'm not wearing... You know how much I'd be sweating if I had that on the whole time?
[244:14.27]Can I run faster?
[244:21.19]I trade my wink for Otto's feet no uh it very clearly says wink in camera it's currently 61 in Las Vegas yeah but I'm indoors wearing a suit jacket like you know I'm not gonna I'm indoors in this one room wearing a suit jacket just sitting here
[244:49.47]No, I'm not doing it now.
[244:50.47]I'm doing it because it's the only clothes I... People that just came here have no idea.
[244:56.75]Why am I in a suit jacket?
[244:57.75]I just know... That's just no reason.
[245:11.52]what a weirdo take it off I'm not wearing it right now no alright okay I have to explain this a bunch of people probably are here that weren't here like two hours ago

[245:37.27]So I had to grab something real quick.
[245:38.60]So I have a suit jacket top.
[245:40.74]If somebody has to redeem a fucking wink, I have to put on my suit jacket and wink into the camera.
[245:45.66]It's a long story.
[246:08.45]That was a great image.
[246:17.79]Looking right... I feel like that's how I look.
[246:20.47]If somebody has like a camera... Oh, it's in front of their house and you ring their doorbell.
[246:25.79]It's like, oh, okay, I'm ready.
[246:26.89]And then you just look up and you're like, oh, hi.

[250:05.69]There's been at least two real ones, and I've done two.
[250:07.51]What's wrong with my lips?
[250:14.41]Oh, why am I a corpse?
[250:26.78]I know it's blue, but why are my lips like that?
[250:41.55]He's freezing.
[250:50.99]He had some food.
[250:53.52]He looked like Violet from Willy Wonka.
[250:55.90]He's freezing.
[250:56.56]Someone help him.
[250:57.18]Oh my god.
[251:07.47]Crack stream part 2.

[252:08.12]No.
[252:09.08]If only I had arms.
[252:11.56]Why does today after 12,000 years have to be the day that I don't have fucking arms?
[252:18.00]No!
[252:35.55]You mouth that's not gonna work Blink is it fake?
[253:26.55]Let me say something.
[253:27.15]What was that?
[254:01.32]I've upgraded.
[254:02.28]I got my arms back.
[254:07.39]Now they have eyes on me.
[254:09.03]Oh.

[255:02.68]Are these, are these people even part of a fight?
[255:41.93]Keep firing!
[255:43.15]Blow him to pieces!
[256:31.18]Do it!
[256:36.90]I don't know where the bullets are coming from.
[257:00.67]Fire every single missile at that man.
[257:03.92]The half-assed until you can't count it.
[257:28.28]I'm kind of getting into Batboy territory here.
[257:32.23]It's getting there.
[258:03.51]Hey, by the way, in case you haven't figured it out yet, Capcom made this game, and CyberConnect2 also did this stuff.
[258:11.91]In case every single... Just let's remind you, every 20 minutes.
[258:15.85]There even was a full-on credit sequence where he was floating around and the credits were going scrolling down the screen.
[258:32.30]I think it's a little late for credits.
[258:33.96]It's anime Jerma.
[259:00.78]Okay.
[259:01.54]No, no, no.
[259:02.26]I'm sorry.
[259:03.18]You can't.
[259:04.14]You can't.
[259:04.52]What do you say now?
[259:05.12]What are you going to say now about that?
[259:07.76]Okay.
[259:17.54]Those are the pre-credits.
[259:18.50]Those are the real credits.
[259:23.38]Season 2 ending.
[259:36.42]Please be floating.
[259:42.52]It's DLC time.
[259:46.74]Wait.
[259:49.22]No, it's not.
[259:53.94]No, this is part two of Rebirth End.
[259:55.86]Oh.
[260:01.44]No, we got like five more episodes.
[260:10.48]It's time to kill Diablo.
[260:12.24]What?
[260:12.50]I'm not done with this game.
[260:15.02]What are you talking about?
[260:16.02]Alright, man.
[260:17.76]Yeah, you got to the end.
[260:19.34]Alright, let's go.
[260:20.04]It's time to kill Diablo on Hardcore.
[260:21.66]Let's go.
[260:24.21]No, we're not done.
[260:30.25]Guys, I'm streaming for five days in a row.
[260:33.99]There's plenty of time to kill Diablo.
[260:45.07]Yeah, we're good.
[260:53.29]This is part three.
[261:00.52]Make sure to pace yourself.
[261:01.96]No, I'll be alright.
[261:02.54]I'll be good.
[261:07.28]We got plenty of stuff to play, so it's not like, you know, I hope we can't... I need stuff to do.
[261:18.29]Drink water.
[261:18.91]I've been hooked up to a saline ivy this whole stream, guys.
[261:20.99]I'm fine.
[261:23.00]Golden spider, rise and shine, Asura.
[261:31.96]I lost myself again.
[261:36.38]No, you haven't lost anything.
[261:37.58]You've gained the power to save the world.
[261:40.62]Save?
[261:41.28]I could not even save a little girl with this power.
[261:45.64]Uhhh... Uhhh, no, that's not, that's... Sorry, that's not him.
[261:50.82]Let me fix that.
[261:53.97]Ah, wait, you have a destiny to... I got cut off there.
[261:59.69]Somebody turned the stream off right when I got in the middle of that one.
[262:03.09]You have a destiny to fulfill.
[262:04.27]I was going to scream really loud, but then it was like, I don't want my voice to hurt.
[262:06.60]I'm screaming for five days in a row.
[262:11.02]Uhhh...
[262:15.89]I'm not gonna do it.
[262:16.57]I'm sorry.
[262:24.52]Testing.
[262:24.84]I think that'll work.
[262:31.17]What are you guys linking me here?
[262:39.27]Trying to show me something important.
[262:44.12]That's creepy.
[262:46.90]Freaky!
[262:47.60]What even is that?
[262:48.88]Part 3, Karma.
[263:07.36]Play Frogger for the Game Boy.
[263:08.46]You play as a frog, dumbass.
[263:10.62]Even Argus could not defeat you.
[263:13.44]Why does that make me a dumbass?
[263:16.04]Why do you keep coming back?
[263:19.90]What is it that you are fighting for?
[263:22.40]And this power of yours?
[263:25.14]How can it surpass the power that took us 12,000 years to attain?
[263:29.32]Need to do more heroes this week?
[263:36.53]Maybe.
[263:38.53]We'll see.
[263:39.53]We'll see.
[263:40.01]He is too much of a threat.
[263:42.31]He must be stopped here and now.
[263:48.13]What was the Bromastra?
[263:57.89]Hey, it sounds like my microphone.
[264:04.04]What was that?
[264:19.81]It's the Death Star, but this time it's made out of a human.
[264:24.17]In the shape of a human.
[264:27.08]It's just a giant human Death Star.
[264:46.89]Is it a cosmic entities to remind Olga you cannot do this With that one blast do you realize how much mantra will be lost?
[264:58.27]All the souls that have been given for the cause
[265:01.23]Do you not realize that this will hinder the coming of the Great Rebirth?
[265:05.02]Then we will just get more Mantra.
[265:07.60]With the mortals under our control, our supply is endless.
[265:11.50]We do not finish him now.
[265:14.12]There will be no Great Rebirth.
[265:16.77]Wait.
[265:17.77]I will finish Asura.
[265:19.21]Like you did before.
[265:22.03]If we finish him now, once and for all, he can never come back.
[265:26.63]Do not stray from the gods.
[265:28.30]That power is made for the eradication of the Goma.
[265:31.94]Do not waste the souls of the dead, like him.
[265:36.76]This conversation is over!
[265:39.31]You will not interfere!
[265:45.17]Bad guy, good guy, bad guy becomes good guy, good guy.
[265:52.94]I will not let you do this.
[265:54.24]He's drawn on muscles.
[265:58.89]This dude, he's a fat guy, but he drew on the muscles.
[266:06.31]I guess he's around all these demigods all the time.
[266:08.45]I guess he needs to keep up, I guess.
[266:19.89]Where are you going?
[266:22.89]Is it not obvious?
[266:24.63]I'm going to stop this injustice.
[266:27.07]Lord Yasha has gone mad!
[266:28.23]He's wearing a muscle shirt.
[266:29.81]Do I get to play as a new character now?
[266:33.77]I do.
[266:34.07]No!
[266:49.19]Does he have a chute?
[266:51.04]He does.
[266:51.32]That sound is... where is it from?
[267:11.19]I don't know.
[267:11.63]It's from something.
[267:12.47]It's like a lasso or something.
[267:16.02]I forget.
[267:17.50]From everything.
[267:18.18]Yeah.
[267:25.88]Come here.
[267:32.52]That's a cool move.
[267:34.91]I need somebody to fight.
[267:37.93]Let's go.
[267:46.30]Bad bad bad

[268:44.79]What?
[268:57.26]He's not falling for it, no?
[269:10.34]You need to play Ninja Gaiden?
[269:12.02]Stay out of this!
[269:12.71]Either way, you cannot stop the Brahmastra now!
[269:16.59]Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden, Ninja Gaiden.
[269:19.47]Even gods are not above reproach.
[269:27.23]The Brahmastra has entered the final preparation phase.
[269:43.88]Commencing mantra charge.
[269:46.78]Mantra charge completion in T-minus five minutes.
[269:51.85]It's begun.

[270:47.14]Go outside.
[270:49.14]Get some air.
[270:50.52]Come back.

[272:17.48]Is this a mobile game?
[272:19.79]Why are you just saying that?
[272:21.73]You get me going.
[272:22.47]You know what I mean?
[272:25.75]I think saying that, because I've been playing this game for like four and a half hours, so I think that saying that's going to make me be like, what the fuck, dude?
[272:32.65]Mobile?
[272:33.21]Come on, dude.
[272:33.87]Give me a break.
[272:34.87]No shit.
[272:43.20]I know all the tricks.
[272:48.96]Good.
[272:50.42]Just good.
[272:58.37]This would be a pretty cool iPad game, honestly.
[273:25.96]Ooh, that's cool.
[273:28.52]We get to see... We get to see it coming up from the horizon?
[273:31.96]Where is he?
[273:34.70]Well, we got to see it, and then now it's not here anymore.
[273:37.91]Come on.
[273:38.11]I thought we were going to get a cool sequence where I ran down into his mouth or something.
[273:51.49]No.
[273:52.65]Wait.
[273:56.66]Fuck.
[273:58.26]Jesus.
[273:58.50]I can't even fucking see what's going on.
[274:00.96]How do I dodge that?
[274:02.42]Oh.
[274:37.00]I'm just going to use this.
[274:46.89]Use it, use it, use it.
[274:48.13]Don't want to die.
[274:50.13]Am I using it?
[274:57.04]Alright, we're going in.
[275:11.64]Aww, look at my health.
[275:13.08]Final sequence?
[275:14.32]Am I invisible?
[275:42.21]Does this count as your anime for the year?
[275:47.62]This is not a television show.
[276:04.25]No, I'm not watching this on TV.
[276:05.41]I'm playing this on my Xbox 360 console.
[276:09.50]This is a video game.
[276:15.02]Where am I going?
[276:20.38]That's a lot of people.
[276:32.71]Am I gonna get it?
[276:38.72]I didn't make it!
[276:42.64]All that for nothing, I didn't even make it.
[276:59.40]I couldn't stop the migraine beam.
[277:01.10]Okay.
[277:02.32]Oh, well.
[277:03.18]He's gonna... He can't do it.
[277:20.83]It's over.
[277:21.69]Let's rewind 12,000 years and learn about why we lost. ...
[277:54.52]I feel like this is you guys in chat right now.
[277:57.74]This is me, and this is you guys.
[278:00.38]About how you feel about this game.
[278:02.58]You're just like, oh no.
[278:05.81]Emotional.
[278:13.51]Lord Yasha's interference has diverted the beam.
[278:15.97]Damage report.
[278:16.97]Unable to fire.
[278:19.03]Damn you, Yasha.
[278:26.97]That was a big beam.
[278:32.46]Hey, some protagonists just are unstoppable.
[278:36.00]It's good to see that this protagonist dies all the time and loses every fight.
[278:42.31]This is always turned into stone, burnt to death.
[278:50.21]I've died three times in the course of four and a half hours.
[278:55.43]One of those was 12,000 years ago, so... Not bad.
[279:10.35]His power of molding is infinite.
[279:21.78]He's just so angry, he keeps coming back.
[279:26.86]It's a 13.
[279:27.10]Cause and effect.
[279:30.32]I gotta take my jacket off.
[279:31.52]I'm like starting to sweat in this thing.
[279:32.82]I was scared that there was going to be a wink.
[279:35.33]Somewhere on Gaia.
[279:37.91]To maintain my beauty, a little exercise is necessary once in a while.
[279:43.95]Consider it an honor to be purified by someone with such grace.
[279:47.95]That's what I would say if any of you impure had any brains.
[279:58.30]This is the only chance for you filth to shine.
[280:01.99]After dashing through the hoard of goma, Sergei bows gracefully at the same moment.
[280:06.80]The goma are ripped to shreds in the background.
[280:45.13]At least you can dive beautifully.
[280:54.36]Lord Surji, I have a report.
[280:58.04]During our attempt to fire the Brahmastra upon Hasura, Lord Yasha interfered in deflected blast.
[281:05.19]God, guys.
[281:05.87]Alright, I'm just gonna keep going.
[281:11.72]How do you have this many points?
[281:12.82]How do you have like a million points?
[281:16.66]Where did you get a million points?
[281:26.55]A typical of him.
[281:27.27]I knew he would show his true colors one day.
[281:34.64]Can't wait to see the look on his face.
[281:35.58]Yes, sir.
[281:36.00]Lordeos has summoned you regarding the incident.
[281:38.25]Tell him I'll be right there.
[281:39.13]I got fooled?
[281:43.63]That was a... What?
[281:46.25]That wasn't the right thing?
[281:46.99]I was at 14.
[281:50.49]I actually debated.
[281:54.73]Oh, well.
[281:58.73]That's alright.
[282:07.57]My internet died for hours and you're still playing this.
[282:10.91]Yeah, I'm gonna play.
[282:14.25]I'm gonna beat this game.
[282:17.73]How is this such a foreign concept to everybody?
[282:29.19]I'm gonna play, uh, I'm gonna play this game today.
[282:33.29]You're still playing this?
[282:34.41]Yeah, that's...
[282:37.88]That's what I'm doing.
[282:39.58]That's what I'm doing today.
[282:40.90]I know you're busy, but can I get a high five?
[282:49.13]Yeah, you can.
[282:52.37]That just like scared me.
[283:13.97]Well, well, well, here they come.
[283:16.93]I don't know, for some reason, people think that... I'm gonna get, like, halfway through the game and be like, oh, yeah, I'll keep going.
[283:23.82]No, no, no, turn.
[283:24.84]I'm gonna hit the... I'm gonna hit the power box and then spike the Xbox into the ground and watch it explode.
[283:30.42]And then press a button and here's Jump King.
[283:32.48]I had planned on it.
[283:36.34]Dude, why are you still playing this?
[283:39.97]Get out!
[283:40.67]Rip the power cord off.
[283:41.85]And then press a button.
[283:42.63]Here we are, Jump King.
[283:49.09]Dude, how have you not spiked your Xbox into the ground already?
[284:00.41]This is a pretty cool Disney ride.
[284:26.03]You're getting the true ending DLC, right?
[284:32.41]This is not a joke.
[284:33.35]Here's money for it.
[284:36.80]I don't know.
[284:39.36]Are you sure you don't want me to smash my Xbox?
[284:53.69]Here's $300 for a new Xbox Xbox 360 is not $300.
[284:56.21]It's like 60 It's like less than a
[285:31.93]What is this fish doing?
[285:35.15]Does anyone have any idea of what this thing is actually doing?
[285:38.19]Why is it doing this?
[285:40.09]Like, get the fuck away from me!
[285:42.41]He's just being fr- No, he's just like, get out of here!
[285:47.19]Like, you're just in the way!
[286:01.44]Are you winning some yeah
[286:29.18]And because of it, three-fourths of the Karma Fortress's mantra had been consumed.
[286:39.22]Two hours earlier.
[286:41.42]That is everything I witnessed.
[286:47.70]My body's just hot right now.
[286:50.52]Just heat is coming out of my body.
[286:54.34]But...
[286:55.96]Yes.
[286:57.86]I... Why do you hesitate?
[287:01.14]Speak.
[287:03.04]All these years, I have believed in the cause.
[287:07.28]But Asura's mantra has proven powerful enough to rival that of our own.
[287:11.84]That of the Brahmastra.
[287:15.20]After the blast, we lost track of his whereabouts.
[287:18.68]I mean, obviously, final boss, right?
[287:21.82]Lord Deus.
[287:23.60]Jeremiah, Jeremiah, what?
[287:26.51]You don't.
[287:30.77]Lord Deus, I have a report to make.
[287:32.99]I used the Brahmastra on Asura.
[287:35.01]Yes, I already know.
[287:38.01]You are dismissed.
[287:39.75]But my lord, Yasha tried to... Dismissed!
[287:51.22]Lord Deus...
[287:56.07]Must I repeat myself a third time?
[287:59.57]Who's this thing, Snoke motherfucker?
[288:04.47]My lord, forgive me.
[288:06.45]He just sits in a chair and just goes.
[288:21.39]But you can't see because I don't have any clothes on.
[288:34.13]Yasha, sir.
[288:39.26]Power without a purpose is meaningless and worthless.
[288:43.10]A purpose that is firm can change the impossible.
[288:46.80]That is the power of our cause.
[288:49.47]Wait, is this a boss fight right now?
[288:53.39]Stories bouncing around all over the place.
[288:56.41]Then you understand what we must do.
[289:07.68]Here comes the boss battle music.
[289:11.09]Well, that was quite entertaining.
[289:18.09]So dedicated to the cause, so earnest in our fight to save the world.
[289:25.32]An absolute shitload of community subs just came in.
[289:32.17]About 32 Nixons.
[289:33.53]Thank you for the 20 community subs.
[289:39.05]That's a storm.
[289:42.80]Thank you.
[289:44.20]Thank you, Richard Nixon.
[289:45.22]That's a lot of subs.
[289:57.04]As you wish.
[289:58.24]20 community subs.
[289:59.60]Goddamn, thank you.
[290:00.92]These are the toads of this universe.
[290:03.66]I just figured it out.
[290:05.29]Holy shit.
[290:06.01]Snarobosses just gave 20 community subs.
[290:25.97]That's 40 subs, 20 back-to-back.
[290:27.77]Thanks, guys.
[290:28.97]Snarboses.
[290:29.55]Wait, have they evolved?
[290:42.40]You can just buy a new Xbox.
[290:45.25]I'm not going to break something.
[290:49.13]I own one already.
[290:50.89]Why would I do that?
[291:03.92]Because it's funny.
[291:05.26]It's funny.
[291:16.43]Oh, that was different.
[291:24.44]Alright, it's another elephant.
[291:28.22]Now here's the real filler episode.
[291:29.52]We already did elephant before.
[291:32.02]Elephant and turtle were both filler episodes.
[291:48.30]Yeah, this is elephant episode, turtle episode.
[291:59.21]meter meter meter oh well good time to use it is with two rhinos just focus on him focus on the opposite
[292:30.75]I'm invincible.
[292:34.83]Am I still invincible?
[292:38.49]Doesn't matter.
[292:45.26]It was so laggy.
[292:46.12]I couldn't even.
[293:01.66]offline.
[293:02.44]He's lagging offline.
[293:04.14]Nice lie.
[293:05.16]Nice lie.
[293:05.76]Lagging offline.
[293:14.56]That was a good small clip from the movie.
[293:27.92]Brute ninja.
[293:35.19]I feel bad about that.
[293:36.15]Does anyone else feel bad after watching that?
[294:08.11]Who did that?
[294:10.07]Septentrion Mizar.
[294:21.72]You are out of time.
[294:23.56]They were about to reach the village.
[294:26.66]Ah.
[294:36.05]You see how they willingly put their souls to please their gods.
[294:45.81]Oh, he's tossing it aside.
[294:47.25]You gonna throw it at me?
[294:52.74]I thought he just gave it the finger.
[295:05.84]I thought he just flipped off the town.
[295:20.35]What's this for again?
[295:28.78]before the mortals are devoured by the goma we purify their souls and turn them into our power this is nothing new it's the same thing you've been doing for the past 12 000 years you just fought a meaningless battle how is their weapons bastards one way or another we must gather souls
[295:57.57]Or the Brahmastra.
[296:00.69]The Goma's behavior has been more resting for a while.
[296:06.03]You ever think about just drinking fucking decaf?
[296:12.00]You remember what our duty is, do you not?
[296:18.98]Even gods must dirty their hands.
[296:25.98]And then he goes to spit in his face, but he forgets he has the mask on right there, and it just hits right in the bottom of the mask.
[296:42.12]It was me!
[296:43.18]Dead, but... Well, there goes another boss that's not a boss.
[296:56.85]He's getting more and more Lord of the Rings Gollum every time we see him.
[297:05.62]He's going full hollow at this point.
[297:22.87]Hey, Dee?
[297:26.30]Roll B, I'll take it.
[297:29.34]It's time to roll credits.
[297:30.34]Play an ad.
[297:35.38]I can't.
[297:39.94]I can't even run ads on my channel, guys.
[297:43.81]Every time I've tried, it doesn't work.
[297:54.97]omega LOL no add Andy
[298:09.80]Ooh, snowfield.
[298:36.12]That is when it appeared.
[298:50.33]scorched black soot covered body with the rage glowing in its eyes by the time we realized it was the fallen one the battle had already begun watching from afar neither our fellow soldiers nor the goma were any match for him terrified about what was happening before our eyes we could do nothing but hide and shiver with fear after the fallen had annihilated them all he roared out towards the heavens as if he were calling out to someone
[299:18.98]After that, I continued to pursue Asura.
[299:21.68]My men were horrified and ran away, but by that time I did not care.
[299:24.70]Asura ran onward and encountered more Shinkoku soldiers and Goma, which he ripped to shreds in an instant.
[299:33.05]Interestingly enough, he had no eyes for civilian demigods or humans and left them alone.
[299:39.05]At that moment, Asura is headed toward the area where Lord Sergei and Lord Yasha are conducting a purification.
[299:46.23]What is he?
[299:47.25]What is he trying to do?
[299:49.73]Sound of his ferocious cry still rings in my ears.
[299:52.11]I must know what it all means.
[299:54.39]Okay.
[299:57.97]He's doing Obama.
[300:00.00]Was I?
[300:06.00]Loss.
[300:13.68]Now what?
[300:21.53]So this guy turned out to be kind of a chump, huh?
[300:28.53]Wait, am I making it?
[300:32.29]Am I doing it?
[300:33.91]I thought it was like puppeting him.
[300:49.48]But the cat is out of the bag now as they say 12 000 years ago When he was branded a traitor
[301:19.98]Just let him like stand on the ground?
[301:22.82]This is weird.
[301:25.06]His feet are just dangling.
[301:26.26]This is odd.
[301:26.73]Who do you think took Mithra?
[301:32.75]Who do you think I took her from?
[301:48.16]It was I. I killed your precious sister.
[301:59.09]Joker audition.
[302:02.45]Kill Jester.
[302:04.75]Kill Jester.
[302:06.17]How boring.
[302:08.22]I thought you would show me a more beautiful face.
[302:11.86]I...
[302:25.15]Why am I holding his head?
[302:28.89]Can't they just talk?
[302:29.61]This is weird.
[302:30.90]I'm just Venom.
[302:54.40]Head squish.
[302:54.90]We're gonna get another one.
[302:56.62]I knew we were gonna get another one.
[302:58.12]I knew it.
[302:59.82]This was a matter of time.
[303:07.67]If we get the hat trick on head squishes... You owe me a soda.
[303:19.96]Okay, what's with this in anime?
[303:21.16]Somebody help me here.
[303:24.16]Everyone always does this.
[303:25.28]They lean... They lean forward like this.
[303:28.79]And they, like, lean forward and they go like this and their arm is up like this.
[303:49.27]The game started, so I have to... Oh, I have to... I'm playing games myself?
[303:54.55]See, look, he's doing the, like, I've-gone-crazy anime stance.
[303:59.62]That happens in every anime.
[304:01.88]Watch.
[304:12.37]How do you know?
[304:12.89]Does that...
[304:20.34]Because I've seen like 10 of them.
[304:34.55]Give me a second.
[304:35.33]What the fuck are you doing?
[304:37.43]Stay with him.
[304:39.81]Stay with him.
[304:44.69]Stay with him.
[304:45.07]Stay with him.
[304:45.45]Stay with him.
[304:45.79]Stay with him.
[304:55.75]Good, got some good hits on that one.
[305:03.40]That one.
[305:05.52]Watch out!
[305:30.31]No!
[305:31.12]No!
[305:31.60]My one hit... My one fucking hit move thing!
[305:34.76]What?
[305:37.74]Oi, oi, oi!
[305:50.45]Alright, I gotta...
[306:07.67]1,000 miles per hour There it is Got it Hi everybody, sorry for doing the ayaya
[306:31.59]Apologize every day.
[306:34.09]Apologize every day.
[306:35.75]Now, it would be cool if we changed sides.
[306:41.52]Right?
[306:42.10]If they flipped it and now I control Asura.
[306:43.74]That would be really cool.
[306:53.00]Asura.
[306:54.01]We, the seven deities, have chosen to bear this world on our shoulders.
[307:04.70]Shit, I missed it.
[307:08.01]Is that supposed to happen?
[307:10.13]I think that's supposed to happen.
[307:15.19]It's supposed to happen.
[307:15.95]Alright, there's a rip.
[307:43.63]Did it work?
[307:47.03]I just ran ads.
[307:54.13]It didn't work.
[307:57.17]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[308:02.51]No one's going to get any.
[308:04.71]I swear to God, my ad profile is shadow banned on Twitch.
[308:08.26]I really think it is.
[308:16.47]Hold on, let's see.
[308:18.23]15 seconds.
[308:22.29]Hold on, let's see.
[308:22.79]Okay, hold on, here they come.
[308:35.03]Asura's Wrath.
[308:48.12]Oh, did you guys see it?
[308:49.60]How's the ad break?
[308:52.90]I got an ad on my phone.
[308:54.48]Oh.
[309:01.54]Is this game vegan?
[309:03.08]Yeah.
[309:05.68]Okay.
[309:06.90]Dude, I don't even know what the fuck the movie's doing.
[309:27.73]Whoa!
[309:31.01]He just fell down.
[309:31.57]He failed the QTE.
[309:32.84]Good.
[309:34.28]Good for us.
[309:44.48]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[309:53.51]Ah!
[309:57.00]Shit!
[309:57.64]How did I miss that?
[310:04.64]He didn't even put his hand down!
[310:05.88]He didn't even swing!
[310:07.76]He didn't even swing.
[310:08.70]He swung after I died.
[310:09.86]He's building here.
[310:38.59]What the fuck is going on?
[310:39.43]I'm moving too fast.
[310:40.29]I can't even see what I'm doing.
[310:41.83]What the hell am I?
[310:43.45]What?
[310:46.78]Hello?
[310:49.24]I'm moving too fast!
[311:01.35]I was moving way too fast.
[311:13.89]Oh man, he fucking one-hit killed me.
[311:18.41]Okay, I was going too fast.
[311:20.29]That's just all super speed.
[311:22.81]Alright, let's go.
[311:30.72]I thought for some reason I could walk around it somehow.
[311:38.05]Get this fucking jacket off!
[311:43.03]Goddamn wedding over here Oh
[312:27.53]Come here.
[312:28.83]Jeez, it's too fast.
[312:30.37]I go... You move so fast.
[312:35.46]God damn, this is going to be hard.
[312:36.82]This is the hardest fight so far.
[312:41.88]Oh, my God.
[312:42.68]Sometimes he doesn't do it.
[312:44.58]Just kill me.
[312:45.08]Just kill me.
[312:45.56]Kill me.
[312:46.08]Kill me.
[312:46.88]Kill me.
[312:54.53]Kill me.
[312:57.41]We have a pee break?
[313:05.30]I need to pee.
[313:06.80]After this mission, we'll do a pee break.
[313:08.96]Okay, then he falls down.
[313:13.25]Okay.
[313:17.27]Let him dash.
[313:29.51]Same deal.
[313:30.09]Getting close.
[313:34.25]Back up.
[313:37.36]Alright, here we go.
[313:42.32]Come on.
[313:46.90]Do it.
[313:47.16]Dash.
[313:48.90]Here it goes.
[314:11.01]Dammit!
[314:11.63]I thought he was dashing.
[314:13.18]Sorry, didn't take much damage.
[314:17.46]Fuck, I thought he was... That's so annoying.
[314:20.31]Fuck, I thought he was doing the whole thing.
[314:37.87]Alright, don't use the speed unless I need it.
[314:39.49]There we go.
[315:09.36]Alright, only one more.
[315:10.94]That should be it.
[315:13.94]One more good one.
[315:21.31]AHHHHH!
[315:24.35]Alright, this should be it.
[315:25.23]Come on.
[315:26.85]Come on!
[315:30.31]Agh!
[315:30.87]Needs like one more!
[315:40.50]I'm saving the world.
[315:45.30]It's no easy task.
[315:49.85]I play my part.
[315:50.93]As best I can.
[316:08.84]good I'm losing frames here it doesn't count we're at like 14 frames a second I win
[316:49.91]Is the QTE the same button?
[316:53.41]It's usually Y. Yeah.
[317:04.34]I hope he keeps devolving.
[317:08.04]Yeah.
[317:08.50]Okay, are we gonna get another form?
[317:10.64]Can he just be like a puddle of mud or something with like Two Fingers?
[317:16.47]He is the enemy.
[317:18.95]I should dispose of him where he stands.
[317:23.08]But my soul tells me different.
[317:26.12]It... screams to me.
[317:28.62]Do not let him die!
[317:42.87]How many times are we going to do that?
[317:55.85]You think you would punch with the other hand by now?
[317:57.79]Civil War.
[317:58.47]That really was Civil War.
[318:13.29]I have business in Shinto.
[318:16.83]Wait, why is he normal now?
[318:19.39]Wait for my return.
[318:27.11]Yasha... You... Dead for the fourth time.
[318:37.20]Number four.
[318:41.99]I hope we appear back on that pillar to climb.
[318:44.89]I am Yasha of the Seven Deities.
[318:47.70]No more.
[319:23.52]There's a 15.
[319:24.52]Two more episodes remain until we get the final story.
[319:42.94]Here comes episode 16.
[319:52.35]Oh look, it's Jerma's grade in college.
[319:58.39]What's wrong with that?
[319:58.93]Is that P-Brick?
[320:02.47]Yeah, no, don't worry.
[320:04.09]We will.
[320:05.63]Thousands of years ago, in Deus's office.
[320:08.91]Yasha, we decided.
[320:09.85]Why are you so hesitant?
[320:12.33]It's the only way we can save this accursed planet.
[320:14.49]But to kill a few to save the many, I do not feel that would be just.
[320:18.21]This has nothing to do with justice, it is our cause.
[320:21.04]A village with no name.
[320:36.43]Great guardian.
[320:37.37]Why do the Goma exist?
[320:38.65]Why do they come and take everything from us?
[320:40.87]Well, my lord, my son's death was not in vain, was it?
[320:44.15]No, it was not.
[320:44.77]We would have been powerless without his prayers.
[320:47.92]I see.
[320:48.22]Thank goodness.
[320:48.84]Son, your death was not in vain.
[320:51.28]But I wish you could have lived to see a world of peace.
[320:53.40]Let us meet again one day when you are reborn in a different life.
[321:04.02]Maybe this is an office.
[321:05.54]Well, I've seen so much pain and suffering of our people throughout this internal war.
[321:09.12]If you say we can stop this, then I am at your command.
[321:11.80]I too shall become a demon.
[321:14.11]You've made the right choice, and I'm confident you will make me very proud.
[321:16.59]From this day forth, I shall live only for the cause.
[321:21.65]Until I fly away in a Corvette.
[321:26.31]Alright, pee break.
[321:27.70]And then we're getting to the end here.
[323:45.77]Alright.
[323:45.93]I don't know if this is going to sound weird, but my room smells like chocolate.
[323:50.26]For some reason.
[323:54.59]It smells like chocolate in here.
[324:18.25]how many times must I repeat this back here again we have protected our world with this power we the seven deities have finally brought stability and order to our world that is it this irritating feeling
[324:42.89]this anger inside of me I don't fight for good and I don't fight for evil I just fight I will say it once more
[324:59.64]I'm gonna lean back in my chair.
[325:01.30]Oops.
[325:02.36]I'm leaning back in my chair right now.
[325:04.70]Take a look at this.
[325:07.59]This is a new mic sound, right?
[325:10.63]Yes.
[325:11.41]The source of your power is your wrath.
[325:14.85]It is so powerful it could scorch your very body.
[325:19.23]Unleash your rage and let your harm do the rest.
[325:23.35]Yes.
[325:24.01]Give in to the fury.
[325:34.28]Spider?
[325:34.92]Spider?
[325:35.38]Somebody said he's... He's giving birth.
[325:38.48]Uh...
[326:03.86]God damn it.
[326:06.86]Alright.
[326:30.51]Okay.
[326:31.99]You just have to go over there.
[326:35.73]Exact same thing happens in the Fall Metal Alchemist intro.
[326:39.81]The exact same thing.
[326:52.02]How would you know?
[326:52.50]Because I've seen it.
[327:01.40]I swear to God, watching anime for some of you guys is the equivalent of me, like, snorting coke before I stream.
[327:07.76]Wait, you... You did that?
[327:11.75]Should you have done that?
[327:17.07]Snorting anime before the stream turns on.
[327:19.05]Yeah, I've seen a couple.
[327:23.97]But not a big deal.
[327:49.07]Oh, that was right in the face.
[328:00.31]Shit.
[328:09.44]Come on.
[328:09.78]Stop. Stop. Stop. Stop.
[328:36.35]I actually have to sit up.
[328:40.75]Too many people on screen.
[329:04.86]Jesus.
[329:09.98]Thanks for the help.
[329:16.16]This area sucks.
[329:18.51]I'm going to die.
[329:23.45]Yikes.
[329:32.15]This place sucks.
[329:34.33]I'm not even going to walk on it.
[329:47.24]Stop telling me the story while I'm driving right up to the screen.
[329:51.42]It just rips around.
[329:58.15]Now I'll walk on it.
[329:59.15]No.
[329:59.31]What the fuck are you doing?
[330:02.79]Hey, you know the guy that's in front of me?
[330:14.72]Just kill me.
[330:15.68]Just fucking kill me.
[330:23.08]This has to last, like, five waves.
[330:36.46]That guy can't believe he just got a kill.
[330:39.49]Oh, my God.
[330:40.23]I actually did it.
[330:41.75]I shot my little fucking PP gun at him while he died from that.
[330:45.33]That's unbelievable.
[330:46.93]Never happened before ever to me.
[330:48.05]Oh, my God.
[331:06.26]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[331:09.24]You gotta be kidding me.
[331:10.68]Get out of here.
[331:12.10]I'm gonna fucking smash the Xbox.
[331:32.35]How have I not hit him in the ear?
[331:38.65]Go!
[331:57.91]I'm fucking dead
[332:25.16]Why?
[332:27.72]This is unbelievable.
[332:49.67]Alright, here comes the worst part.
[332:51.23]This is gonna be the worst part.
[332:53.41]Use burst?
[332:53.83]I don't have it.
[332:57.56]Burst is the way to beat the level.
[332:58.72]Alright, I gotta clear out the little guys first.
[333:27.66]Yeah.
[333:54.35]Okay.
[333:55.55]Hi.
[333:55.61]Hey, let's fight now, please.
[333:58.29]I'd love to fight with you.
[334:02.61]Let's go.
[334:03.47]Stop pretending.
[334:04.79]Dude, I gotta fucking pretend for views, man.
[334:07.87]Come on.
[334:08.25]What are you doing?
[334:08.73]You get it?
[334:11.74]I've got to.
[334:13.16]How am I going to watch?
[334:16.32]If I don't get hit three times and die by ten people surrounding me.
[334:30.13]Without a block!
[334:51.41]Imagine blocking in an action game.
[334:53.81]It's just stuff with ten people on the screen around you in a circle and the lock-on sucks.
[334:59.46]Alright, just do it again, do it again, do it again.
[335:10.17]This is the best part about playing an action game.
[335:12.41]When you fucking stand still and nobody will touch you.
[335:16.41]It's like they know that you're not moving around.
[335:19.09]No one's even trying to hurt me right now.
[335:21.17]Why does this happen?
[335:23.95]I've decided I will attack you now!
[335:27.54]I waited 15 full seconds to do anything.
[335:33.08]But when you actually are trying to beat the game... I've turned it on times a thousand.
[335:45.97]Shai isn't doing anything, this is what I'm talking about.
[335:48.19]Just fucking kill me.
[336:00.28]I was gonna say, you almost missed.
[336:04.48]He's mauling in a cutscene game.
[336:08.72]Alright, this is the one.
[336:10.36]This is the one.
[336:10.82]This is the one.
[336:11.26]This is the one.
[336:12.94]I didn't even have time to react.
[336:14.76]That was stupid.
[336:22.42]That was stupid.
[336:33.51]What the fuck are you doing?
[336:40.77]What the fuck?
[336:52.33]I'm not locking on to anybody.
[336:53.47]I can't.
[337:21.00]No, that's not the guy I wanted to walk onto.
[337:25.38]Who do you think I was trying to target?
[337:31.24]That's not the person I was trying to target.
[337:34.19]I'm glad he's dead anyways.
[337:55.02]Fuck, man.
[338:01.21]These guys still behind me.
[338:03.47]Where did it even come from?
[338:12.50]Alright, I can make this count.
[338:31.55]Yeah!
[338:38.47]What the fuck is happening right now?
[338:43.79]I can't!
[338:44.75]These people are freaking me out!
[338:50.20]Jesus Christ!
[338:51.48]No, don't!
[339:14.43]do something do something do something do something thank god oh no
[339:58.05]Back up, back up, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[340:03.13]I got a fucking idea.
[340:03.85]Here's my idea.
[340:04.59]This is it.
[340:07.50]Fine.
[340:14.48]Wee!
[340:19.37]That was horrible.
[340:28.22]That was painful.
[340:29.52]That hurt.
[340:31.72]Those equality tuber noises.
[340:33.24]Yeah, I know.
[340:33.74]Dude, imagine that in a fucking copulation.
[340:47.62]Oh no, it's probably going to get harder.
[340:49.30]Oh boy, I...
[341:24.35]Alright.
[341:34.63]Good.
[341:34.92]Get me out.
[341:35.88]Get me out.
[341:37.10]How do I get out?
[341:42.42]What's going on?
[341:46.70]This guy's fucking up the door.
[341:51.84]Okay, let's go.
[342:01.57]This game just got like 5,000 times harder.
[342:31.38]It does not involve you.
[342:32.96]What?
[342:34.83]This is no time to argue.
[342:37.43]Two children who think they're gods.
[343:01.57]Great, he's getting angry again.
[343:06.96]Last time he did this, he turned into a goblin.
[343:11.74]What?
[343:22.06]I don't get it, but he's connected to the girl, so I can't kill him?
[343:29.17]It's one of those slime hands you get as a kid from like the 50 cent machine, the little gumball machine.
[343:36.97]That was a sick stock electricity sound.
[343:39.09]I can probably find that right now.
[343:48.87]What was that for?
[343:50.81]Who's here first?
[343:52.05]He is mine.
[343:53.61]Who cares?
[343:55.72]Stay out of my way.
[343:59.38]I got it?
[343:59.80]Do I got it?
[344:01.10]Did I do it?
[344:03.37]Are we gonna do two on one here?
[344:27.08]Alright, let's go.
[344:29.48]You have blinded by your own pride.
[344:32.80]There are other paths for bringing salvation to Gaia.
[344:36.44]Here comes a triple threat match.
[344:39.26]I don't care about that.
[344:42.40]I don't know how to save the world.
[344:45.60]What I do know is if I save Mithra, this hell will finally
[344:58.41]Powering up too close.
[344:59.47]Hmm.
[345:01.29]How many arms do I get?
[345:03.09]Do I get more than six?
[345:04.49]Give me ten.
[345:27.67]Watch out for the electricity.
[345:40.10]Shitload of electricity.
[345:43.50]Drive iframes.
[345:44.22]Good, good, good!
[345:56.33]Double team!
[346:01.13]Ow, fuck.
[346:03.75]Nice, it worked.
[346:09.51]Hey, I'm not that far away.
[346:15.93]That's what I like to see, the good double.
[346:18.61]We both shoot the same gun.
[346:23.61]Oh, shit.
[346:24.73]I don't have any power.
[346:28.12]Alright, I get the character.
[346:47.38]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[346:48.70]Hurry, hurry.
[346:54.66]What?
[346:54.99]Hey, hey.
[346:55.79]Huh?
[346:56.77]Who was that?
[346:58.69]Okay, wait a minute.
[346:59.77]I didn't even get a tenth of a second to do that last one.
[347:05.19]That was bullshit.
[347:31.61]Get in there, let's go!
[347:33.07]Start attacking them!
[347:36.57]Get in there!
[347:40.10]Alright, almost there.
[348:04.90]shit oh shit oh shit oh no oh I just had it off timing ah I had it off timed alright I know what he does now
[348:36.75]When you get close enough, you gotta be fucking careful.

[348:47.18]That shit.
[348:48.58]Oh, come on.
[348:49.10]I thought I was out of the range.
[348:50.24]Give me a break, game.
[348:57.38]Get in here!
[348:59.40]This dude isn't doing anything.
[349:01.24]Usually helps.
[349:01.82]Not this time, apparently.
[349:12.86]the other dude didn't do this time he just he's supposed to help me
[349:39.01]He says that to every star.
[349:40.58]Oh my god.
[349:41.60]Jesus.
[349:43.66]Let's jump.
[349:58.54]Good job.
[349:59.33]Good job.
[349:59.75]Keep missing.
[350:12.39]He has to do the big stomp thing That's not it
[350:35.07]I'm so confused.
[350:38.75]I'm gonna die.
[350:44.15]Why do the cameras grip around me?
[350:45.75]Okay.
[350:52.67]I'm dead.
[350:52.85]This camera's giving me a headache.
[350:55.23]I'm not even locked onto him, he's just like, gripping around when he dashes forward.
[351:10.57]Yeah, it's two guys versus a fucking hacker That goes that far?
[351:35.33]I thought it didn't go that far
[351:37.77]I can't even, man.
[351:38.37]Yeah, please.
[351:50.33]He's giving me fucking diarrhea.
[351:53.69]What happened?
[351:56.11]What?
[352:01.70]Alright, I think I got it for free.
[352:13.52]It's too much stimulation right now.
[352:14.98]It's too much stimulation.
[352:31.91]Fuck this guy.
[352:32.83]It's just flashing lights.
[352:40.85]Get out of here, please.
[352:42.01]Just kill him.
[352:42.67]Help me fight him.
[352:46.88]Thanks a lot, idiot.
[352:47.94]You just ruined it.

[355:13.55]Oh my fucking god.
[355:15.90]Stop rushing.
[355:16.58]I can't attack him unless I get in close.
[355:18.52]It's the only way I can attack him.
[355:21.08]I have to get in close, otherwise he just keeps doing the hurt your eyes move.
[355:26.82]He's gonna do this forever.
[355:33.29]The only way I can attack him is if I get his hook.
[355:38.50]I had it there, but... Jump instead of dodging?
[355:49.36]I tried that before I got hit by it.
[355:51.40]I can only jump over that one.
[355:52.50]I can dodge through the... I can only jump over the circle on the ground.
[355:56.36]See?
[355:56.70]Look!
[355:59.87]Look!
[356:04.26]I just have to prove it to three people telling me to jump.
[356:30.50]I had like 30% health, I'm not gonna just... I need full health.
[356:34.66]He doesn't pay attention!
[356:45.01]Idiot.
[357:01.46]Thanks to the three people that told me to jump.
[357:08.11]Thanks guys.
[357:26.31]No, really, thanks.
[357:26.85]I think I wouldn't I would have been like what are they talking about?
[357:29.27]Why is there a dodge roll?
[357:57.33]That is perfect.
[358:03.54]Perfect.
[358:26.52]Wait, that's not part of the video.
[359:02.23]I don't even care.
[359:50.73]I seem to like to do this to people.
[359:53.89]I like to lift them up and let them talk.
[359:56.31]Or their neck.
[359:57.33]To fight the will of the entire planet, you must attain power greater than that of a god.
[360:16.69]Behold, this is that very power.
[360:25.40]Is this supposed to be him?
[360:38.52]We have to fight the galaxy brain guy?
[360:48.97]I don't know why that's funny.
[360:50.13]Give me a laugh.
[360:58.99]Galaxy room.
[361:05.42]I'm stupid!
[361:09.98]Takara, Genanam, Indra, Deus.
[361:17.90]Destiny has a master, and it is me.
[361:27.03]Okay.
[361:40.70]Doesn't matter how big you hit.
[361:43.32]Well, we finally agree.
[361:46.73]That doesn't make us friends.
[361:48.97]Of course not.
[361:50.85]Still.
[361:52.35]Deus.
[361:53.79]So, this is your decision.
[361:56.77]But this is... Now stop talking to yourself.
[362:02.48]Asura, you... With a target that big, we can't miss.
[362:09.62]Always dwelling on the fight.
[362:12.08]Very well.
[362:18.22]What is he doing?
[362:18.98]Oh, he's hauling his car.
[362:24.99]How was I going to get there?
[362:29.19]How was I going to get there?
[362:43.88]We're gonna have to deal with... We're gonna have to do... Walk on and shoot enemies for an episode.
[363:13.27]I'll get 18
[363:37.82]How am I about to do the... How am I about to fight the final boss?
[363:42.36]Or... whatever.
[363:44.28]Can I just get a grenade up his nose or something, or whatever I'm gonna do here?
[364:04.03]I don't know.
[364:30.98]Still going?
[364:34.68]Still going?
[364:44.65]Wait, this is cool.
[364:45.53]It's cool.
[364:52.92]But I'm not really doing it.
[365:14.44]Good.
[365:15.18]Good!
[365:15.90]Dumbass is wasting your wing points.
[365:56.10]Warp!
[365:56.32]Oh my god, it's... I can't even see him.
[365:59.97]I can't fly it.
[366:16.96]Dummy.
[366:25.34]That's definitely better than a toy It's like the king of all Cosmos
[367:04.44]He's clapping us.
[367:05.12]He's clapping us.
[367:06.70]He's going to squish us together in his palms.
[367:14.23]Why not?
[367:15.49]Is he going to pray?
[367:18.65]Did he get us?
[367:38.65]Nope.
[367:39.41]Maybe.
[367:40.59]You'll see.
[367:41.07]This is a cool-ass design.
[368:00.65]Yeah, that big guy is pretty cool.
[368:02.85]Pretty cool.
[368:03.95]I will say.
[368:09.75]Here goes 17.
[368:14.14]Alioth on the bridge.
[368:16.00]Ah, Sacra, Davanam, Indra, Deus.
[368:18.30]I cannot believe I'm seeing it with my own eyes.
[368:20.16]It's magnificent.
[368:21.32]Not even the colossi when compared to its power.
[368:23.72]By merging with the Karma Fortress, it has become the most powerful being in existence.
[368:28.12]It'll purify Goma Viltra with the use of the priestess's power and the seven trillion souls we have accumulated.
[368:34.11]There's a lot of people on Earth.
[368:38.17]That's a lot.
[368:39.81]That seems like too many people on Earth.
[368:43.54]But would that not also destroy the planet as well?
[368:45.96]Seven trillion people!
[368:49.62]Perhaps it was just the Brahmastra.
[368:52.70]Now that Lordeus has merged with the Karma Fortress, he can concentrate and blast with great precision.
[368:59.29]Takra, Davinam, Indra, Deus is invincible.
[369:02.59]Lots of fun.
[369:03.89]Laugh.
[369:05.43]Deus, once...
[369:11.51]They've been farming the planet for 12,000 years.
[369:13.19]Yeah, but haven't we been... Aren't we of the knowledge that they've been using it?
[369:19.84]Like cast spells and throw parties and stuff and have power and do stuff and destroy things, right?
[369:25.57]They've been using it, haven't they?
[369:48.06]Episode 17, Fleet of Clay.
[369:51.42]We crashed!
[370:09.71]We gotta kill his heart now.
[370:16.12]Holy crap, Lois.
[370:24.90]Why is that?
[370:25.64]I don't know why that's making me laugh tonight.
[370:28.33]Why is that doing that?
[370:29.61]I don't know why I think that's funny today.
[370:33.67]Sorry.
[370:34.37]No, who cares?
[370:35.25]Fuck that.
[370:36.21]I'm not sorry.
[370:40.16]Atari!
[370:43.30]It's probably Mr. Apology now, because of Ayaya.
[370:48.93]Now I think if I eat, like, peanut butter and jelly with, like, the peanut butter on the top instead of the bottom, I gotta have to apologize to you guys for that.
[370:58.84]Oh, dance game?
[370:59.52]You don't do jelly on top?
[371:00.78]Atari!
[371:29.92]Come on!
[371:33.08]Open it!
[371:37.28]Burst!
[371:37.46]Sonic Adventure 2.
[371:39.47]Tails mechanic.
[371:42.21]I actually have to control this.
[371:43.75]Yes.
[371:43.91]This is the reactor that turns the souls into mantra.
[371:47.73]If we destroy it, it will cut off Deus's energy supply.
[371:51.07]What do you want to do?
[371:55.99]What?
[371:57.37]Wait, should I be breaking these?
[371:59.59]I can break them.
[372:00.23]He's trying to talk, I cannot hear anything he's saying.
[372:21.38]Sorry, I can't hear you, I'm destroying all the capsules.
[372:25.38]I am only here to take Mithra back.
[372:31.46]Right.
[372:32.54]The control hub should be closed.
[372:35.06]Okay.
[372:35.71]Where are these doggies at?
[373:03.22]What?
[373:05.37]That's not fair.
[373:07.03]There's no opening.
[373:08.65]Give me a break.
[373:14.47]I'm going through it.
[373:28.67]Hey, okay, you know, you know there's a problem when Aladdin for Super Nintendo didn't work out.
[373:36.03]There's an issue here.
[373:39.11]I'm getting fired at at this point.
[374:17.54]These lasers are terrible.
[374:20.61]Look at how bad these lasers are.
[374:23.71]You don't have a laser that can shoot forward?
[374:27.47]It's just arced up and down, left and right.
[374:31.32]Why did you shoot it?
[374:35.14]I'm getting real sick of zooming on the face and then hit Y. It's happened a hundred times.
[374:39.54]It's happened a hundred times.
[375:05.38]Hurry.
[375:06.82]Jeremiah hates the game.
[375:09.90]Feels bad, man.
[375:12.34]No, I'm fine.
[375:12.84]Mithra!
[375:35.40]This game would be so much better if his other four hands turned into mouths and talked.
[375:43.57]That'd be fun.
[375:45.63]They'd talk to each other and shit and turned and it was like the mouth hand.
[375:49.35]That'd be awesome.
[375:54.48]I do.
[375:55.68]I do understand.
[375:56.62]But I must do what I think is right.
[376:02.77]I'm talking about like his puppet, like his hands are puppets.
[376:08.03]And they talk and they have different personalities and shit.
[376:12.21]What?
[376:12.85]He's actually crazy.
[376:14.55]What do you mean?
[376:16.24]What?
[376:16.56]Sir!
[376:40.10]Back up back up back up.
[376:46.47]What's he doing?
[377:22.86]The same boss?
[377:23.62]I think so.
[377:24.08]Am I blocking this?
[377:36.30]What just happened?
[377:38.40]I'm distracting him, hit him!
[377:44.28]Hit him, hit him!
[377:45.10]Nice job.
[377:45.56]Alright, get in!
[377:48.36]That's good call teamwork.
[378:02.98]Hit him.
[378:07.57]Oh, shit.
[378:08.49]Did I not get it?
[378:14.59]Hit him.
[378:17.57]One of us can distract.
[378:20.82]Oh.
[378:32.38]Did I not get it?
[378:33.04]Let's go up and get him.
[378:57.74]Get in.
[378:58.20]Good.
[378:59.22]Oh, now it's just 1v1.
[379:00.56]God damn it.
[379:01.28]We can't co-op him anymore.
[379:03.72]Jesus.
[379:11.51]I have no idea what to do here.
[379:25.59]I don't know what to do.
[379:33.99]I'm going to get this.
[379:42.94]Why have you betrayed me?
[379:44.96]It was slow.
[379:45.44]I have come to my senses.
[379:47.04]Man, that move sucks.
[379:50.12]I don't even know how he's going to do it.
[379:55.44]Your cause is a mistake.
[380:11.66]Jesus, man!
[380:12.30]Give me an opportunity!
[380:15.60]Wait till he dies.
[380:19.95]Ah!
[380:50.47]What?
[380:52.09]Huh?
[380:54.63]What?
[380:55.67]What happened?
[380:58.67]What?
[381:02.71]We were doing a... We were about to do a... QTE?
[381:06.43]It didn't... Okay, let's go.
[381:12.39]I know what some of this is moving up.
[381:15.01]Oh, shit!
[381:23.04]Damn it.
[381:23.90]I thought he was doing the jump thing.
[381:57.84]I didn't think he was going to be on the ground for that long.
[382:07.66]It's hard to tell what he's going to do.
[382:30.87]Alright, this is a bust.
[382:31.93]This is a shit run.
[382:58.27]Um, probably.
[383:00.40]I'm not gonna use him though.
[383:01.74]Really?
[383:03.46]He's still playing this LOL.
[383:19.97]Yeah, yep.
[383:21.25]Yep, yep, yep.
[383:22.33]No salvation without gods!
[383:35.29]Move, do it.
[383:50.40]Oh, that's not the move I wanted you to do.
[384:09.04]Oh, that's so bad to fuck up.
[384:10.70]That was almost 80% of my whole health.
[384:12.58]Fuck me.
[384:20.59]No.
[384:23.01]It's just when you get in close and you're fighting and it's just like, cut in!
[384:28.58]Oh, nope, you pressed B. You were pressing B to attack the guy.
[384:41.88]When you're getting close like that and it does the cutscene, it's just like you're pressing D because you're hitting him, you're attacking him.
[384:46.88]I'm so glad this shit got buried in hell in 2015.
[384:50.24]Like, nobody wants this back.
[385:18.09]Might as well just die again, Jeremy!
[385:20.41]No!
[385:24.22]There are other ways!
[385:25.28]Why have you betrayed me?
[385:40.39]They're just played on normal?
[385:41.23]Well, this is like the second to last boss in the game.
[385:44.41]I can't change it back now.
[385:45.41]I'm going to beat this motherfucker as well.
[385:48.02]Why have you betrayed me?
[386:10.85]How many have left?
[386:20.02]I don't know how many deities have left.
[386:27.04]We've time traveled like three times.
[386:55.41]He stays on the ground.
[386:57.06]I keep forgetting it.
[386:58.02]What?
[386:58.34]I tried to dodge it, it didn't...
[387:23.95]Oh my god, my hand's sweating.
[387:25.03]Did he hit me with something?
[387:41.16]I have to fight the electricity man again.
[387:46.53]Look at all the people I have to fight again.
[387:48.65]They're just killing me.
[387:57.37]I just start making bite marks?
[388:00.79]Can't go in.
[388:03.99]Alright, here we go, this is the one.
[388:07.82]Fuck.
[388:29.23]It's only... I don't know how I'm gonna say it.
[388:51.53]Hold on.
[388:51.89]I love how Jervis is too stupid to recover health.
[388:54.84]What are you talking about?
[388:55.80]What do you mean recover health?
[388:58.36]What are you... Wait, what?
[389:01.04]You're a liar.
[389:01.82]You're a liar.
[389:02.52]No way.
[389:03.24]There is no salvation.
[389:19.67]I would laugh so hard if I was able to recover health the whole game.
[389:26.20]That would be an embarrassment.
[389:27.58]Come on, stop doing that.
[389:52.77]Okay.
[389:53.81]I'll go in.
[389:55.83]You have to jump after getting hit.
[389:59.65]I haven't gotten hit yet.
[390:00.81]The whole time I've been playing.
[390:03.46]My health has been dropping.
[390:04.38]I have like a debuff.
[390:05.16]I don't know what the fuck's wrong.
[390:37.57]There's the one right here.
[390:38.65]This is the one.
[390:39.13]This is the one.
[390:39.65]This is the one.
[390:44.50]Patience.
[390:45.04]Just have patience.
[390:58.09]Come at me.
[390:58.47]This is the one right here.
[391:06.20]Alright.
[391:07.08]Now we have to trade with Asura.
[391:09.40]And do the same thing again.
[391:10.29]I'm ready for it.
[391:23.33]What are you doing, Jeremy?
[391:24.23]What are you doing?
[391:24.79]What are you doing, Jeremy?
[391:26.59]I'm going too fast.
[391:27.45]It's a problem.
[391:33.18]It's too fast.
[391:33.76]I don't like this.
[391:34.18]Where is he?
[391:40.16]Get him.
[391:40.78]Okay, we're good.
[392:24.96]do it do it just do it already
[392:36.02]Thank you.
[393:07.59]Do we have to do face through with this guy?
[393:42.94]I'll be okay.
[393:48.28]I'll just look up and all my teeth are gone.
[393:57.99]I'll be alright.
[394:13.61]I didn't even say it this time.
[395:00.82]She cries because she knows of the world's suffering.
[395:05.67]Once my world is liberated from the golem, I shall cease all the cries.
[395:13.80]This killed his dude already.
[395:17.80]He's crying, man.
[395:20.64]I'm crying right now.
[395:21.96]He killed his dude.
[395:35.00]Oh no, I knew I had to do it again.
[396:06.45]I was out of that fucking range.
[396:32.67]What the fuck is going on here?
[396:36.71]What the fuck just happened?
[397:01.95]No, I tried to fucking dodge.
[397:03.57]I'm fucked.
[397:04.79]Nah, I'm gonna do this shit again.
[397:06.29]He got me with a reverse counter.
[397:34.69]Just press B. Yeah, I know.
[397:39.85]It's so easy.
[397:40.83]Just press the B button.
[397:42.07]And then sometimes press A. Why is it so hard for you?
[397:59.23]Alright, that's what happens.
[398:00.27]Holy fuck.
[398:05.31]That's a couple... But, hold on.
[398:21.17]I've done that move before, though.
[398:23.07]Hold on.
[398:23.51]I need to test this.
[398:29.18]After getting hit, yeah.
[398:30.94]How come it's not working?
[398:37.30]I see.
[398:37.61]That didn't recover health.
[398:41.21]It's recovering a little bit of health.
[398:51.28]You take less damage.
[398:52.94]Right.
[398:53.44]It's worded weirdly.
[398:55.98]It's you take less damage, not recover health.
[398:59.60]You take less damage.
[399:02.82]Why do they word that so strangely?
[399:04.42]I remember reading that.
[399:07.02]It was like, oh, you take less damage.
[399:09.37]But, like, after, like, I thought it was like for like a few seconds after the damage.
[399:17.91]Recover damage.
[399:19.53]You salvage HP.
[399:34.24]Why can't it just say you recover health?
[399:36.70]Why?
[399:54.14]Oh, my back is wicked itchy right now.
[399:56.44]I have, like, the itchiest bag.
[400:00.32]I have to, like, scratch my back with, like, a whip or something.
[400:02.19]Hold on.
[400:14.08]Imagine being so good you beat the game without healing.
[400:16.28]Dude, that's a great way to look at it.
[400:17.26]Thank you.
[400:24.81]Is it always going to be B?
[400:28.05]I'm scared to press it more than once.
[400:29.50]Is it going to be B every time?
[400:31.32]I'm not going to get there.
[400:54.15]Did you just counter it?
[400:58.37]Why did you?
[400:58.87]What?
[400:59.19]Oh, really?
[401:01.98]I got countered.
[401:03.24]How did he counter that?
[401:05.24]Oh my god.
[401:26.25]I guess I could go in the circle.
[401:42.20]Attack!
[402:07.11]I'm scared to try to go in the circle, I'll be honest.
[402:09.11]Alright, here we go.
[402:29.51]Alright, now punch it a million times.
[402:32.83]It's always beer.
[402:33.55]It's always beer.
[402:42.63]Damn it
[403:18.54]Alright, I'm almost... Fuck you buddy.
[403:27.30]Eat my ass.
[403:57.53]Kill him!
[403:59.55]Dude, just beat this guy already.
[404:01.18]I'm trying to do that!
[404:02.32]Nobody even said that.
[404:04.04]I'm just making that up.
[404:06.94]Somebody probably did.
[404:10.53]Where is he?
[404:40.61]Not so fast.
[404:42.02]That's still alive.
[404:43.74]Let's do this again.
[404:44.86]You and me.
[404:45.92]Two on two again.
[404:46.82]Oh, that's it.
[404:56.87]I got it.
[405:09.19]Wait, he's not going to say a funny line like the goblin thing does?
[405:12.99]He's not going to ruin a scene?
[405:46.71]That's not how gravity works.
[405:48.81]She's like a god.
[405:49.98]She is weightless.
[406:15.77]What do you think?
[406:17.37]Charging at whatever is in front of you can save the world?
[406:21.88]What?
[406:25.46]What?
[406:30.02]Uh-oh.
[406:31.42]It's gonna eat the whole planet.
[406:57.20]Yeah, that scared me a little bit, too.
[406:58.34]That really was random loud noise in a YouTube video to fuck with you.
[407:10.60]I don't know what you mean.
[407:24.57]It is true.
[407:28.87]I cannot stop it now.
[407:31.47]So we were the good guys.
[407:33.23]Now that... Lytra has taken them.
[407:37.19]Is this... he was the good guy?
[407:39.53]If I kill Lytra, I can end this place.
[407:49.30]Lytra is the will of the planet itself.
[407:52.28]It will devour all the souls on Gaia.
[407:57.07]You didn't pay for it yet That cost $11.99
[408:24.48]Empty your pockets.
[408:26.10]You never change.
[408:31.47]Asa, how could I have been defeated?
[408:38.48]Does it matter?
[408:43.93]I see.
[408:45.81]So not even you know.
[408:48.78]Then there is no hope.
[408:51.20]Just turn and just soccer kick this guy's head.
[408:55.13]Mithra.
[408:55.67]Mithra.
[408:55.97]Just a full running start.
[409:10.90]I do not deserve to be called your uncle.
[409:14.16]That's your mom's brother.
[409:15.20]It is alright.
[409:16.52]What the hell are you talking about?
[409:19.94]Mithra.
[409:22.76]Where's father?
[409:24.60]He is there.
[409:27.44]He fought to save you.
[409:31.49]But there is still something left we must do.
[409:37.45]What?
[409:39.60]Is he crying?
[409:40.80]Am I crying?
[409:41.74]You can hear that?
[409:46.66]All Jerma, he's crying.
[409:48.06]You can hear that?
[409:48.64]I thought I could be emotional without having to be caught on camera.
[409:56.65]What are we supposed to do about this?
[410:28.30]At what point do we just leave?
[410:31.02]At what point do we just turn the fucking ship around and be like, well, there's 500 quadrillion other planets.
[410:37.18]Should we just leave?
[410:40.84]Go somewhere else?
[410:51.42]You take a look at that and you kind of go, yeah, that's probably it.
[410:54.20]That's probably it for Earth.
[411:03.16]The Feet of Clay.
[411:23.47]and the Imperial Hall.
[411:25.24]My liege, there's little time before Vlitra's next revival.
[411:28.55]We do not start preparing preemptive measures soon.
[411:30.67]It will be too late.
[411:33.12]Choosing to do nothing is also an option.
[411:34.76]With change comes opposition.
[411:36.72]Ginkoku would not respond well.
[411:38.40]Oh, this is the guy in the beginning that we fake killed.
[411:41.55]Would you have our people take up arms and wait for Viltra's return after we finally obtained a moment of peace?
[411:45.99]With each awakening, Viltra grows more powerful than the last.
[411:49.61]Next time, our forces may not be enough to subdue it.
[411:51.61]The rate at which our civilization is growing far surpasses that of the impure.
[411:56.79]Furthermore, the eight guardian generals have never been stronger, especially with such a powerful priestess.
[412:02.14]By my liege.
[412:03.84]Enough.
[412:04.94]I've given you my answer.
[412:05.90]You are dismissed.
[412:06.66]In Deus's office.
[412:15.88]Commander Deus, the Emperor did not grant us permission?
[412:19.22]Regrettably, no.
[412:19.96]The Emperor is only interested in protecting himself.
[412:22.08]He must be disposed of.
[412:24.37]Not like rain all over everybody.
[412:25.83]Resign.
[412:52.46]But you'll just be sacrificing yourself for the cause.
[412:55.96]My purpose has always been for the cause.
[412:57.38]I have no desire to sit on a throne for all eternity.
[412:59.50]Episode 18.
[413:02.12]This is it, right?
[413:32.41]Buy the DLC.
[413:33.01]I'm not doing the DLC tonight.
[413:47.40]DLC is like five minutes.
[413:49.02]What?
[413:50.42]Throw this game in the trash.
[414:01.45]Holy shit.
[414:05.07]It's 2 hours or so.
[414:06.37]Yeah, I'm not doing a 10 hour stream.
[414:13.90]What?
[414:18.18]Oh, I thought we... For a second I thought this was the DLC.
[414:20.48]Alright, let's go kill the snake inside the planet.
[414:40.71]Can I still buy the DLC?
[414:59.06]Microsoft points?
[415:00.00]Yeah.
[415:00.44]That's a pain in the ass.
[415:12.39]I wasn't even looking.
[415:13.69]I was just looking.
[415:18.04]I was just talking to you guys.
[415:22.76]I wasn't even watching.
[415:40.75]Blow it up?
[416:12.70]That's what humans must be thinking.
[416:14.30]They kind of have to deal with this shit every day.
[416:43.35]That's right
[417:14.22]Alright, here we go.
[417:22.25]Where's the snake?
[417:22.73]Snake number one?
[417:34.27]Here goes one.
[417:52.31]This is cool.
[418:06.86]This is cool.
[418:07.42]Really cool.
[418:11.40]Wish I wasn't tired.
[418:12.94]Yeah, this is super interesting.
[418:17.02]Yeah, I'm kind of deciding I'm going to eat a sandwich and go to bed and take a bath.
[418:23.04]Are we going to fuse?
[418:29.22]Please fuse.
[418:39.91]Do a fusion.
[418:41.43]Why are there two of these?
[419:03.39]I'm playing too.
[419:04.25]Yeah, you're playing too.
[419:38.31]Is the body?
[419:40.59]We're gonna go in here and there's gonna be this decrepit little monster in there that's like slimy and slug.
[419:51.79]We're just gonna have to stab it once the whole thing does.
[420:13.05]Well, someone was asking what would people be doing right now.
[420:16.85]There you go.
[420:25.69]I would take out my cell phone and videotape and then fucking throw as hard as I could into space with the cell phone and somebody would find it one day.
[420:32.66]Just turn around and just whip it as hard as I can into space.
[420:37.45]I'm gonna eventually come across and be like, holy shit, this is crazy.
[420:40.49]He has a face?
[421:09.70]Here comes the big brother.
[421:13.80]I feel like I'm fucking hallucinating right now.
[421:44.67]No, this is real.
[421:45.33]Okay.
[421:45.47]We're good.
[421:56.60]This game is so weird.
[421:58.14]It's pretty cool technology, I guess.
[422:00.02]It can simulate bugs all over my room and shit.
[422:03.78]Spiders everywhere.
[422:04.66]It's weird that it can do that.
[422:05.92]I don't know the tech existed to do this.
[422:25.74]What?
[422:25.98]That's a lot.
[422:28.65]That's a lot of arms.
[422:40.00]Mantra Asura.
[422:48.97]power 700 trillion souls.
[422:52.60]It activates the ultimate power.
[423:29.84]I fucking ruined that one.
[423:32.16]That was the end of the game.
[423:33.74]The only thing I could think of was the- alright.
[423:37.42]Every time I hit him, I want that sound effect to play, that old beat-em-up sound effect.
[423:43.62]And then it goes... You guys know what?
[423:49.95]Somebody knows what I'm talking about.
[423:51.01]It goes like... I need to find it.
[423:56.01]Somebody find it for me.
[423:56.85]I know somebody knows what it is.
[424:01.22]The Simpsons beat-em-up game.
[424:15.83]He's like, crap.
[424:21.49]No, someone just knows what I'm talking about.
[424:34.50]No, no, it's the first boss in The Simpsons beat-em-up game in the arcade.
[424:38.70]It's more like the second boss, really.
[424:48.91]LP, do it!
[424:52.75]Is this it?
[425:00.54]Is this it?
[425:02.94]I need to know if this is it.
[425:06.86]Is this it?
[425:07.56]I need to know.
[425:08.04]Seriously, please tell me you got it.
[425:24.56]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[425:26.14]Wrong.
[425:29.77]No, no, no.
[425:30.57]I fucking thought you guys seriously had it.
[425:33.13]I was about to be so happy.
[425:37.43]No, no.
[425:38.11]That was Street Fighter.
[425:40.09]This one.
[425:40.73]Please.
[425:41.44]I know someone's gonna get it.
[425:43.38]It's one person.
[425:44.34]Stop linking the fucking gnome.
[425:46.86]Stop linking the gnome.
[425:52.85]There's a clip of me.
[425:54.11]Please, I know someone's gonna get it.
[425:56.57]So I don't look like a psycho.
[426:09.68]One of them's gonna be right.
[426:12.84]This is all bosses.
[426:13.78]Here it is, here it is, here it is, here it is.
[426:52.60]Nice.
[426:53.14]Okay, I'm not insane.
[426:54.22]Thank you for proving my point.
[427:13.91]Am I alive?
[427:20.57]Alright, now imagine that sound, you know
[427:52.24]How much of this game is just yelling?
[427:53.98]A lot.
[428:08.49]It's this Asura's Wrath, colon, yelling and bloom.
[428:15.59]Is what this game should be titled.
[428:23.36]Ah, ow, ow.
[428:27.00]That just fucked me up.
[428:27.68]Did that fuck anybody else up?
[428:41.95]It's like...
[428:54.51]Core.
[428:56.68]It is the core.
[429:25.04]Turma, how are you still playing this?
[429:37.42]Turma, why are you still playing?
[429:38.98]Turma, why are you playing?
[429:56.54]You know, this is why I have to actually fight a final boss.
[430:03.96]But he's just like me, but better.
[430:10.55]He has extra arms.
[430:11.47]He's angry.
[430:12.42]He's red.
[430:31.94]Letra Core.
[430:37.15]Alright.
[430:37.53]Let's go.
[430:40.57]I hope... This whole game's been QTEs.
[430:43.35]I hope this is just a QTE fight.
[431:07.07]A lot of walking.
[431:44.27]Let's go.
[431:46.53]Fight!
[431:50.47]Attack!
[432:03.36]Attack!
[432:07.39]Oh!
[432:13.49]Get in!
[432:13.73]Get away!
[432:17.33]It's a huge explosion.
[432:27.40]We good?
[432:37.75]I'm gonna save the LT.
[432:42.78]Big bomb!
[432:43.62]Big bomb!
[432:47.48]Uh... I don't know what just happened.
[432:57.48]I think we did it.
[432:59.87]Whoa!
[433:12.10]another one what I didn't get a chance anybody anyone have any idea what's going on I think I'm doing okay I think
[433:47.41]Where are we?
[433:56.18]I tried to do the jump.
[433:57.03]OK.
[434:00.03]I tried to do the jump again, and I couldn't get it.
[434:17.19]I don't even have an indicator.
[434:20.13]Oh, please.
[434:22.18]Yeah, right.
[434:59.92]Am I gonna dodge through it after jumping twice, probably?
[435:08.69]Ah, shit.
[435:15.51]Just go in, go.
[435:35.77]Tell him I have to go to bed soon.
[435:46.26]Yeah.
[435:49.10]Shit!
[436:04.36]I didn't even get a... Where's the indicator?
[436:06.56]What the fuck?
[436:09.34]I... I have homework to do.
[436:24.69]I'm gonna lose, like, probably six or seven more times.
[436:32.02]Okay.
[436:39.80]Why didn't he know how to get knocked down?
[437:05.79]I'm already at 70% health.
[437:09.29]Did you regret setting this to hard?
[437:17.57]Yes, because I'm assuming the only difference is you just die in three hits.
[437:22.21]I don't think the game's any harder.
[437:44.59]Okay, it's not very long.
[437:54.55]Get in!
[437:55.59]Get in!
[437:55.89]Don't get in.
[438:14.44]Give me, give me, give me, gimmie, gimmie, gimmie, give me it.
[438:18.44]Alright, dodge through it.
[438:27.44]I'll screw it.
[438:31.44]No! What?
[438:40.44]Jerma, I have to light my house on fire.
[438:42.44]What? Pfft.
[438:52.70]Jeremy, I have to go to bed.
[438:54.54]Come on, like, let's go.
[438:55.68]Let's end this.
[438:56.30]Dude, I gotta go to work tomorrow.
[438:57.78]Dude, I have to light my house on fire soon.
[438:59.76]So, like, come on, let's go.
[439:01.26]Let's hurry the fuck up.
[439:03.72]Just kill me.
[439:11.68]I'm missing the birth of my child.
[439:13.48]Well, you shouldn't be here then.
[439:16.94]I'm missing the birth of my child.
[439:18.70]I'm gonna watch this fucking dumb internet e-clown asshole beat this dumb shine-a-flashlight-in-your-eyes boss on hard.
[439:27.51]I gotta stay here!
[439:28.43]I just want full bar.
[439:52.52]Alright, now we go.
[439:56.90]Hit it.
[440:09.31]Save the LT.
[440:11.03]Dodge.
[440:11.61]Attack.
[440:12.15]Fight.
[440:15.09]Hit it.
[440:19.75]Alright, get him!
[440:22.47]What happened?
[440:22.95]Where is he?
[440:24.99]What the fuck was that?
[440:27.17]I just... You saw me jump.
[440:28.70]What's with that fucking stupid... What?
[440:30.96]What?
[440:49.71]Got you.
[440:50.15]Watch out!
[440:52.23]Easy.
[440:54.63]I just beat this boss again.
[440:58.76]I don't... I have a game called, so I don't spoil the screen for myself.
[441:01.26]Did you just win already?
[441:04.86]That's alright.
[441:05.76]Let's do it now.
[441:21.00]I tried to do the jump, but it didn't fucking do anything!
[441:28.06]Okay.
[441:29.40]It... Do you... That is like, point... That's like not even a tenth of a second.
[441:42.11]That's not even a tenth of a second to do that.
[441:51.34]Eat the BLT, Jerima.
[441:57.90]Eat the BLT.
[441:58.84]I'm gonna die.
[442:06.34]Oh, this doesn't even need cheers to you.
[442:11.70]It's just... It's just extra damage.
[442:24.87]I'm going to put it on normal if I can't do this in the next 15 minutes.
[442:28.49]Oh, careful.
[442:31.14]Look, I'm not going to lose very much sleep if I can't beat the final boss in Asura's Wrath on the card.
[442:36.64]Like, I'll be able to go to bed tonight and be like... Disease.
[442:42.11]Don't matter.
[442:58.60]Yep.
[443:10.94]They just keep coming.
[443:13.03]That would be really sick.
[443:31.98]Get in there.
[443:32.96]He dives in.
[443:44.48]He's so far away.
[443:48.63]Okay.
[443:49.57]Oh my goodness gracious, that sucks.
[443:51.49]I...
[444:04.37]We didn't get hit because I was invisible.
[444:37.68]No!
[444:40.78]Holy shit.
[444:41.36]Okay, I got it.
[444:45.18]Hit him!

[445:39.29]Wait till he teleports, he's gonna jump.
[445:40.69]There he goes.

[448:04.26]The first time you're seeing this.
[448:09.10]Dude, what the fuck?
[448:09.94]I thought it was flat.
[448:12.82]This is crazy to me.

[448:55.72]Rise.
[448:57.84]Alright, credits number four.
[449:05.10]Mithra!
[449:06.34]Mother!
[449:31.80]Who made this game?
[449:34.34]Well, I'm surprised somebody's saying that, considering that, let's say, let's say the average viewer is here for, let's say, 30 minutes.
[449:44.33]20, 30 minutes, average time that somebody spends on a stream, maybe.
[449:49.47]Capcom's logo has popped up probably every 25 to 30 minutes.
[449:53.80]So, I'm actually surprised anyone would even ask that.
[450:12.50]So this is the third running credits.
[450:15.17]That's a real wink.
[450:16.07]Alright, fine.
[450:32.49]Alright, see you guys tomorrow.
[450:33.49]I'm not doing DLC right now.
[450:35.99]I'm not making this a total fuckface stream.
[450:39.58]No, I'm going five days in a row here.
[450:41.16]I'm not going to be, stay up, let's do 11 and a half hours and let me fucking burn my eyes out.
[450:48.34]No, I'm not doing the DLC tomorrow.
[450:49.42]We're going to do something else.
[450:59.91]God, that's like sick.
[451:03.96]There you are.
[451:15.56]In the freezer.
[451:20.05]Do the DLC.
[451:22.61]We'll see what we got going on this week.
[451:23.93]I might throw it in here somewhere.
[451:24.99]Because there's a bunch of other... I have like two other Xbox 360 games.
[451:27.79]I've got NBA Street over here that I want to play.
[451:38.50]I just want to get the hard drive so I can actually play Tony Hawk.
[451:44.36]I want to do Outer Wilds this week, too.
[451:45.83]I've been putting that off for a long time.
[451:57.85]No More Heroes 2.
[451:58.47]Yeah, we'll see.
[451:59.57]I got a lot of games.
[452:09.35]I don't know.
[452:09.81]Who knows?
[452:10.29]Black and White 2 is also something I want to do.
[452:14.79]I still have... I want to play Chibi-Robo.
[452:21.24]I really, really badly want to play it.
[452:22.72]I'm just going to get it.
[452:25.18]I'm just going to get it.
[452:34.83]But that was Asura's Wrath.
[452:37.55]It was pretty fun.
[452:38.41]It was over the top.
[452:45.40]I enjoyed it.
[452:49.14]It's not over.
[452:49.78]Well, I mean... It is, but it might not be.
[452:53.47]Should I skip this?
[452:56.43]I can't even skip this.
[452:58.82]What are your impressions?
[453:00.32]My impressions are... Alright.
[453:03.03]The boss fights were really cool.
[453:04.23]I just wish I didn't have to press Y as many times as I did.
[453:09.98]You take away even half the times that I had to press the button Y. And I would have probably thought this was a better game.
[453:29.01]The DLC is... No, I know about the DLC.
[453:31.04]Don't worry.
[453:31.36]Let's see if we can fit it in somewhere.
[453:34.32]What is it?
[453:34.68]Like an hour or two?
[453:35.26]A couple hours?
[453:43.43]Yeah, alright.
[453:44.69]We'll do it probably this week.
[453:45.87]We'll throw it in somewhere.
[453:50.07]That's fine.
[453:52.86]Alright.
[453:54.30]Is it like an after credits scene or something?
[453:59.81]Diablo?
[454:00.27]Yeah, we could do Diablo II hardcore, and then whatever happens with that, throw this at the end.
[454:13.10]Do the DLC now.
[454:15.82]No, I'm not doing a 10-hour stream.
[454:18.35]No.
[454:33.47]Yeah, alright now I'm in I still play Return of the King and I'm kind of concerned to play it just because you know how the last one went Can I skip this?
[455:02.94]Breaking point.
[455:03.66]Total rank?
[455:05.52]D, B, A, C. We can see them all?
[455:20.17]C for crap.
[455:22.12]Hey.
[455:25.64]Oh.
[455:26.76]Oh, there is another thing after this one.
[455:33.35]That's the actual final boss.
[455:34.17]I have to fight the giant spider boss.
[455:36.13]That's why everybody wants me to do it.
[456:09.95]What?
[456:11.57]A hidden episode can be unlocked by achieving an S rank in five or more episodes or complete 50 or more episodes on any difficulty?
[456:19.10]What?
[456:19.26]I thought you guys said there was a DLC.
[456:35.41]True episode.
[456:36.49]A turn of events.
[456:43.89]Look at all these C's.
[456:49.67]A, B, B, A. B, no S's.
[456:56.49]This is actually what my report card looked like when I was in high school.
[457:04.83]Just get an S on easy.
[457:06.05]Yeah, another day.
[457:08.03]Another day.
[457:10.96]Alright guys, we're gonna call it a night here.
[457:13.38]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[457:20.10]Tomorrow we are going to start... Uh, not at... One.
[457:27.47]Probably start somewhere around like two-ish tomorrow.
[457:36.72]Started a little bit early today.
[457:39.25]We'll start round two tomorrow.
[457:40.39]Somewhere around one, two, two-ish.
[457:45.00]The S-Grid is a real thing in Japan.
[457:47.96]Which means, like, super.
[457:50.18]That was fun, though.
[457:50.94]It was worth doing.
[457:52.56]It got really hard at the end.
[457:53.70]I'll see you around 2 p.m.
[457:56.61]Pacific tomorrow.
[457:58.21]Good night, guys.
[457:59.71]Let's do the outro.
[458:00.47]Let's get to the end of the actual stream here.
[458:11.81]That was fun.
[458:12.23]I had a good time.
[458:12.93]Let's get some music on here while we just relax.
[458:27.26]People in chat are mean.
[458:28.36]What am I talking about?
[458:37.32]Did he beat Diablo?
[458:39.90]You're a little late.
[458:40.86]I started farming him.
[458:42.28]I think we beat him like 15 or 16 times.
[458:43.98]Still no uniques though, which sucks.
[458:47.02]Alright, let's do the end.
[458:57.91]I didn't want to go too much longer than this.
[458:59.23]I want to be up and ready to go tomorrow.
[459:03.07]Easy.
[459:03.57]And the next day, and the next day, and the next day, and the next day.
[459:08.00]bullshit you got a gold wrap be great actually alright let's go crackhead gaming yeah kind of what uh circwack thanks for the 500 bits I'm so happy you're playing this it's amazing it's literally a pog simulator first hour is slow but it gets fantastic
[459:35.06]It did start off a little slow.
[459:37.35]But we did give it a chance, and I beat the base game.
[459:40.53]I thought it was good.
[459:41.03]I just wish it was a little less QTE.
[459:46.81]Just enough for me to not, you know, stink my nose at it.
[459:51.94]What's that phrase?
[459:52.66]Something like that?
[459:57.62]It was crazy, though.
[459:59.10]The fat boss, yeah, the big fat boss that puts his finger down.
[460:05.12]The game was made during the end of the QTE.
[460:07.14]Yeah, the era of QTE, unfortunately.
[460:11.52]Still a fun game, though.
[460:15.98]I did enjoy it.
[460:16.84]Otherwise, I would not have played it.
[460:21.33]I wouldn't have streamed the game for almost eight hours if I didn't think it was fun.
[460:25.69]It's definitely worth playing.
[460:27.39]But, thank you.
[460:27.99]Appreciate the 500 bits.
[460:29.25]Thank you, Son of Genova, for the 250.
[460:30.61]Hydra, please check the...
[460:32.71]The Carnivores Saga someday.
[460:34.29]Especially Carnivores 2.
[460:35.53]Or Ice Age.
[460:37.46]They are great.
[460:38.14]They're old as fuck, though.
[460:40.02]I do remember those games.
[460:45.30]Those games were... Those games are crazy.
[460:51.31]He plays the dinosaur.
[460:52.11]Don't you run around as a dinosaur in that game?
[460:59.29]I'll have to see if I can get a hold of some of those.
[461:02.74]No, you hunt them.
[461:04.41]They're attacking you and shit.
[461:05.29]I'll have to check them out.
[461:07.63]Add them on the list.
[461:08.15]We were going to do Tony Hawk's Underground today, but I didn't have an Xbox hard drive or something.
[461:14.67]That was embarrassing.
[461:16.75]But it's all good.
[461:17.23]We'll get that this week.
[461:17.85]I want to play Tony Hawk's Underground this week.
[461:19.39]I really do.
[461:20.73]Probably tomorrow morning I'm going to get up.
[461:22.19]We might even just do it tomorrow.
[461:24.93]Try to get up early and go get one.
[461:30.71]Because I want to do that today.
[461:32.39]So, we're going to have to do that tomorrow.
[461:38.08]Valemi gave 5,000 bits.
[461:40.00]I missed this one.
[461:41.55]They say, Jerma, we tricked you into watching an anime on stream.
[461:45.83]The best part about this is talking to VRJosh about how much he recommended it.
[461:51.05]He's like, don't play it.
[461:52.11]You got to play Sir's Wrath on stream.
[461:53.67]It's awesome.
[461:54.27]It's really good.
[461:54.71]I'm like, hey, so why?
[461:56.31]And he's like, oh, I didn't play it.
[461:58.42]I watched like a few of the cut scenes.
[462:04.44]I did not say, what did you say?
[462:05.64]You said something like that.
[462:06.62]You said something like, what did you say?
[462:09.12]You said something like that.
[462:11.28]Read my recommendation.
[462:12.22]What does it say?
[462:17.08]He said it was like his favorite game ever made.
[462:23.64]Let's get recommendations.
[462:24.62]Let's go search VRJosh.
[462:36.41]He's deleting it.
[462:38.37]Oh shit, you did say that you didn't like it.
[462:40.29]No, you said you liked it!
[463:06.33]See, yeah, but when I said, hey, what makes the game so good?
[463:10.17]Didn't you say, I don't know, I didn't play it that long?
[463:13.77]What did you say in the beginning of the stream?
[463:15.87]You said something in the beginning of the stream.
[463:22.11]That's what I'm referring to.
[463:23.03]He's like, oh, I didn't play it.
[463:30.41]Show us the corpse face again.
[463:31.79]No, alright, you know what?
[463:33.11]I'm just going to purge you.
[463:34.05]Get out of here.
[463:36.59]Stop.
[463:39.53]Uh, but anyways, thank you for letting me for the 50... Thanks for the... I'm freaking giggly today, too.
[463:46.02]Fuck.
[463:50.50]I was freaking giggly today.
[463:51.84]I was just, like, laughy today.
[463:59.41]But thank you for letting me for the 5,000 bits.
[464:00.51]$50.
[464:00.53]Filactory gave $50 as well.
[464:05.02]We did do the whole game, and I'm glad it did.
[464:10.52]We're gonna try to throw it in at some point this week.
[464:17.61]I don't know.
[464:19.69]It depends on... I'm doing... I'm gonna try to do Tony Hawk Underground tomorrow.
[464:23.63]So it's sitting on the same console.
[464:25.70]So...
[464:27.46]maybe I mean if I get really into Tony Hawk Underground tomorrow and I play it for like six seven eight hours then of course I'm not gonna do the DLC but if for some reason I only play Tony Hawk for a few hours or something then I'll just stick it on top of that whatever we'll see I will do it gnarly thanks to the 250 here's a short Jerma dream I dreamed I was in chat during a stream and I typed jermaVenus twice a mod saw it and instantly perma banned me
[465:01.10]I'm sorry that happened to you.
[465:04.70]Shweddyman, thanks for the five community subs, Shweddyman.
[465:09.77]Pugles, thanks for the 400 bits.
[465:11.63]Auto is a speck of dust.
[465:14.69]Or auto.
[465:15.23]No, I can't.
[465:20.34]Wait, what?
[465:25.40]Show auto?
[465:26.08]No, I can't.
[465:31.45]is nothing but a speck of dust of the past.
[465:45.63]That's pretty good.
[465:49.94]Anyways, let's keep going.
[465:51.56]Uh, thank you, Pugles, for the 400 bits.
[465:59.52]Doc, thanks for the $2.50.
[466:00.58]Doc, $3.60.
[466:01.36]Hey, Jerm, I'm thinking of buying you a birthday present, but I'm not sure what color I should get.
[466:07.58]Walkers?
[466:09.08]Just Walkers.
[466:12.81]Uh... Justwalkers.com.
[466:21.96]Well, why is one of the most expensive ones the shittiest reviewed one?
[466:27.95]The one that's $60 is apparently, like, the best one with 22 reviews.
[466:32.53]This one's $135, and it's got three and a half stars.
[466:38.24]Uh, the green one.
[466:39.38]Thank you.
[466:39.66]Appreciate it.
[466:42.90]Thank you, Doc.
[466:46.96]We had huge community subs come in from Snarbossus and about 32 Nixons.
[466:53.96]40 community subs among the both of you.
[466:56.20]Thank you, guys.
[466:56.68]Seriously.
[466:59.03]Thanks for dumping a shitload of subs.
[467:03.45]Speaking of those subs, why don't we show them?
[467:05.75]Let's switch over to here.
[467:11.75]Thanks to all of you.
[467:16.70]Hopefully we see you again tomorrow.
[467:20.16]Hopefully for Tony Hawk's Underground.
[467:26.08]While I play the credits...
[467:29.55]I actually jumped.
[467:30.17]What the fuck is here?
[467:31.13]But I don't hear any noise.
[467:40.76]Underground 2 is more fun?
[467:44.98]Uh... We're gonna have... That's actually a really, really good question.
[467:49.80]I have both of them.
[467:50.76]I have both.
[467:58.05]I was kind of unsure of what I wanted to do.
[468:00.43]I could just do both.
[468:08.30]Thug 2 is a baby game.
[468:10.78]Thug 1 is best.
[468:11.66]Thug 2 is better.
[468:13.30]Thug 1 is classic.
[468:16.66]Yeah, I mean, I knew this was going to happen.
[468:21.13]So I got both.
[468:22.59]So we can just do both eventually.
[468:24.73]We're probably going to start with the first one.
[468:27.02]Seems like the right idea.
[468:28.18]But here come the subs.
[468:28.92]Thanks a lot, guys.
[468:33.16]For your extreme support of this channel.
[468:35.28]Thank you.
[468:39.88]They're short games anyways, yeah.
[468:43.06]Oh, right.
[468:43.66]Soundtrack.
[468:45.36]That whole stream tomorrow is going to be muted.
[468:47.44]So if you're planning on watching the VOD... Sorry.
[468:53.19]But I don't know.
[468:53.99]I mean, I could turn the soundtrack off and put on, like, Yoshi's Island or something.
[468:57.09]But I don't know.
[468:57.47]I'll figure that out.
[469:00.31]Anti-Poetian.
[469:01.75]Thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[469:04.59]Hey, Jerma, I was thinking about getting a jermaRat tattoo and was wondering if you would be okay with that.
[469:09.63]That's not about me being okay with that.
[469:10.99]It's about you being okay with that.
[469:14.34]In 10 years, are you going to think that that's alright still?
[469:17.36]If you want a jermaRat tattoo, that's a you thing that you have to decide.
[469:20.40]I can't decide that for you.
[469:28.50]I would give that a good think.
[469:31.96]Just don't put it on your face.
[469:35.77]You know, put it like, I don't know, somewhere you can hide it.
[469:38.21]Because in 30 years, you might be like, I got a jermaRat tattoo.
[469:43.80]Jerma?
[469:47.32]He disapproved it.
[469:48.62]Never get, don't, no, I didn't say don't get a tat, don't, I said don't put a rat tattoo, a jermaRat tattoo on your face.
[469:58.67]In 10 years, the Jerma's gonna get canceled for saying something fucked up.
[470:17.05]Why are you planning for this?
[470:19.61]I don't like that you're planning for that.
[470:30.54]Long story short, if you're going to get a tattoo, make sure it's something that you really want.
[470:35.20]If you come back to me in like three years and say, hey, this tattoo sucks.
[470:38.18]Why'd you tell me to do that?
[470:39.14]I'm going to say, I didn't.
[470:39.74]I'm going to say, I told you don't.
[470:41.50]I have nothing to do with this.
[470:47.57]Five years are going to be 40.
[470:48.77]Yeah, don't remind me.
[470:52.05]I've heard that comment.
[470:52.89]I don't want to see that.
[470:53.57]I just vomited everywhere.
[471:03.82]Bye, Jerma.
[471:04.56]Oh, go to the doctor.
[471:05.58]Hope you have a safe next day.
[471:07.64]You haven't gotten sick anymore.
[471:08.96]Whatever.
[471:09.32]Drink some fluids.
[471:10.82]Have some soup.
[471:12.10]Goku!
[471:12.54]Thank you, Goku Green, for the 550.
[471:15.21]Jeremiah, I had your stream up tonight while I was doing my testosterone injection.
[471:21.66]When I pulled the needle out, there was a lot of blood.
[471:23.64]It was not anything to worry about because it can happen.
[471:25.44]But I yelled at the same time as Asura did.
[471:27.77]A lot of blood.
[471:45.91]Why did I read that?
[471:46.67]I don't know why... I don't know.
[471:50.07]Jerma's going to be streaming at 90.
[471:51.21]I don't think I've ever... Any injection I've ever had, I don't think there's any blood.
[472:00.31]Blood from a needle.
[472:01.19]Does that happen?
[472:04.39]Oh, be careful.
[472:05.01]Why would you tell people this?
[472:13.90]What, me?
[472:15.38]I bet that I've never had blood.
[472:17.92]I bet having six arms would help.
[472:27.86]I once got a flu shot, and I'm not going to read the rest of that because it's fucking horrifying.
[472:31.95]So, don't get a tattoo on your face of my face, okay?
[472:36.03]Don't do that.
[472:37.33]It'll look really strange.
[472:41.31]Sorry to hear that, Goku.
[472:42.37]Hopefully you're alright.
[472:45.45]Not a recommendation.
[472:46.07]I'm just not really into the VR thing.
[472:47.69]But, no, I never really got into Arma.
[472:48.51]Arma wasn't necessarily VR, but Escape from Tarkov kind of is.
[473:15.45]Not really into the BR thing, though.
[473:16.76]Escape from Tarkov isn't a battle royale?
[473:22.14]Huh?
[473:25.93]What is it?
[473:29.81]It isn't BR.
[473:30.87]What is it?
[473:32.08]Is it...
[473:34.75]Oh, you just... It's just an FPS.
[473:37.39]It's just a realistic FPS.
[473:38.87]Don't they, like, drop everybody in a spot and then people have to, like, extract and shit?
[473:44.37]It's a roguelike FPS.
[473:50.57]Multiplayer Stalker without the anomalies.
[473:54.75]Huh.
[473:56.39]Arena?
[473:56.79]Huh, that's... Alright, that's cool.
[473:57.81]I thought it was a BR.
[474:00.61]I stand corrected.
[474:03.07]Alright.
[474:04.21]Hey, Mark Meltzer.
[474:05.99]Thanks for the $2.50.
[474:06.47]Hey, Jerm, I've always loved your streams, especially the rhythm ones, as of late.
[474:10.67]Speaking of which, would you consider playing the Patapon remaster on PS4?
[474:14.31]Yes.
[474:15.80]It's on the list.
[474:17.24]Glad to see a streamer willing to play older PC games rather than what's hot at the moment.
[474:20.78]There's hidden cult classics out there.
[474:22.26]Love you, dude.
[474:24.24]The reason why I play so many old games is because I'm just not really into any of the new ones.
[474:30.76]You mentioned BR.
[474:31.56]BRs are really, really hot right now.
[474:33.02]And some of the multiplayer shooters are really, really hot right now.
[474:35.44]I'm just not really into them anymore.
[474:38.54]I just am not.
[474:45.95]The last two big gaming trends have been genres I don't really care about.
[474:50.95]The big MOBA explosion five years ago or so, I didn't really care.
[474:56.24]Besides, I played Smite a little bit, but not really.
[475:01.62]I didn't really jump on that too much and then this newest kind of FPS third person br has been a big big explosion the last few years I haven't really been into that either I made 15 videos on smite yeah but that was also back in like 2013. that's not very much considering how big that genre was at the time
[475:31.71]Do people still play?
[475:32.59]My spy's still a big thing.
[475:33.89]People still think it's good.
[475:35.39]I haven't played in a long time.
[475:44.12]25, Dr. Pepper, thanks for the 250 Super Bowl prediction.
[475:46.38]I'm from Kansas City, so I'm a little biased.
[475:51.36]Um... I just... It's just gonna be a fun game.
[475:56.61]It's gonna be a fun game, right?
[476:06.92]Chiefs.
[476:08.56]Okay, I'm gonna have to say the Chiefs for one reason.
[476:13.28]Because of that old Snickers commercial where the guy paints the end zone wrong.
[476:20.55]The whole commercial is a guy painting the end zone for the Chiefs.
[476:25.42]He's going up and down.
[476:26.84]He's sweating.
[476:29.06]He's wiping his brow.
[476:30.25]And he's doing a really, really good job.
[476:31.87]They don't show what he's writing.
[476:34.61]And then one of the players comes up and he's like, Hey, man, that's a really good job.
[476:38.25]But who are the chefs?
[476:40.75]It pans up and it's just the chefs.
[476:42.65]He didn't put the eye.
[476:44.09]He's like, Oh, Jesus.
[476:45.63]So I'm going to say the Kansas City Chief.
[476:58.16]What a great commercial, yeah.
[477:02.03]There you go.
[477:02.29]This is my Super Bowl prediction.
[477:04.93]Alright.
[477:05.61]Chiefs.
[477:06.93]Kansas City Chiefs.
[477:07.69]19 to 6.
[477:13.14]Kansas City Chiefs, 19 to 6.
[477:16.32]Gonna be a fucked up game.
[477:29.44]Hey, Jerma put sun chips in F tier.
[477:31.24]Yes, I did.
[477:32.52]Thanks for the $2.50.
[477:33.30]Jerma, I'm here to tell you that you're still dreaming.
[477:35.26]After you got naked on stream, one guy saw your penis.
[477:38.11]You passed out from embarrassment.
[477:39.27]Every stream from that moment has been in your head.
[477:41.57]Only way you can wake up is to peek your mic.
[477:43.25]Also, you should do it because it's my birthday.
[477:45.87]What a wonderful comment this is.
[477:51.38]You checked every box.
[477:53.42]Happy birthday, by the way.
[478:01.63]Alright, I'll see you.
[478:02.99]Happy birthday, seriously.
[478:04.62]Jerma put sun chips in F tier.
[478:07.26]Have a good one.
[478:07.94]Hope you had a lot of sun chips.
[478:11.36]Wait, we can't leave you.
[478:12.18]We just got one more.
[478:14.76]We just got one more.
[478:18.41]I was gonna stream Disco Elysium.
[478:29.57]But I decided not to.
[478:31.21]People told me it was way too long.
[478:33.92]And that I would get bored.
[478:36.82]You gotta remember, if I cannot complete a game within two to four streams, it gradually drops... I mean, it gradually drops like a rock after that.
[478:51.61]As if I'm gonna play it again.
[478:57.78]Also, I'll be the big 21 next week and be upset there won't be a stream.
[479:01.80]Yes, I will not be around next week.
[479:03.30]I've got a lot of friends coming in.
[479:09.95]But I don't have any plans on streaming it anymore.
[479:15.13]That was a fun one.
[479:17.91]I'm not going to catch you next week.
[479:18.97]Happy birthday, Flugboy.
[479:20.55]Preemptively.
[479:23.27]Why am I uncommitted to playing games?
[479:26.21]I mean, I'm not uncommitted.
[479:27.22]It's just... Okay, here, hear me out.
[479:33.46]If a game is more than 40 hours to get through the main game, off-stream I wouldn't really play it.
[479:40.06]Also, I wouldn't play it off-stream, really.
[479:41.68]Red Dead Redemption 2 is the only exception.
[479:43.93]In probably the last couple of years, at least.
[479:47.08]So if you're talking about, like, this stream is eight hours.
[479:49.00]A typical stream is somewhere around six and a half to, like, seven and a half hours is, like, a typical average stream on this channel.
[479:55.55]So if I can't beat a game in, like, 40 to 50 hours, I really don't want to lock in and play a game for, like, 100 hours.
[480:06.55]Dark Souls.
[480:07.29]Dark Souls.
[480:08.40]Well, look, there is an exception for some of... That's, like, one of my favorite gaming franchises.
[480:17.77]I love Dark Souls, and I love all the Dark Souls games, and all the FromSoftware games.
[480:22.67]So, that's not really a fair comparison, because he's talking about one of my favorite game studio franchises ever.
[480:33.43]Darkwood?
[480:33.97]I beat Darkwood in three streams.
[480:38.32]Darkwood was three streams.
[480:39.64]That game was crazy.
[480:53.09]If I can't do it in, like, under five full streams, it's something I'm probably not going to stream.
[480:57.37]I'll just do it on my own time.
[481:00.11]Unless it's something I'm so insanely into.
[481:03.51]Like, for instance, Elden Ring is going to come out.
[481:05.90]I'm going to stream every second of me playing that game, just because I can't wait.
[481:09.68]And I'm going to play it as long as it takes.
[481:12.22]You guys know that's happening, but that's something that I kind of do.
[481:23.30]Should be fun.
[481:24.94]But hopefully that gives you your answer.
[481:32.06]I wish you luck on your assignments.
[481:38.70]Hopefully you get a decent grade.
[481:41.30]A+.
[481:42.42]Just don't worry about that.
[481:44.04]Nobody cares about that.
[481:46.49]When you get out of college, nobody knows if you got an A+.
[481:48.91]On your fucking paper.
[481:50.11]Don't worry about that.
[481:50.93]Just do your best.
[481:51.83]Do good enough.
[481:53.75]They're not going to see you.
[481:55.01]You got a B+.
[481:55.79]On that fucking paper.
[481:56.59]They're not going to know.
[481:58.09]You got a degree in your hand.
[482:06.67]we know it's fine god knows that's alright how do you work listening to this psychopath yeah pretty good point actually
[482:26.99]Alright, I'll see you guys tomorrow for hopefully Tony Hawk's Underground.
[482:29.87]If not, then we're going to do... Okay, if I cannot get an Xbox hard drive, then we are going to do Outer Wilds.
[482:37.64]Okay?
[482:40.48]Alright?
[482:40.82]Sounds good.
[482:41.94]Alright?
[482:48.17]Good.
[482:49.77]Peek your mic for that guy's birthday.
[482:57.85]I'm not going to peak my mic for somebody's birthday.
[483:02.60]See you guys tomorrow.
[483:03.50]Goodbye.
[483:04.20]Goodbye.
[483:04.78]Goodbye.
[483:05.98]Please don't go.
[483:06.64]I'll be back.
[483:07.42]I will be back in less than nine and 11, 12, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 11, 12, I'm going to be back in like 16 hours or something.
[483:19.25]It's going to be 24 hours.
[483:20.39]You'll see me again.
[483:32.38]We got one more.
[483:32.98]We got one more.
[483:34.87]One more donation from Snoozing Copter.
[483:38.25]Drink filtered water?
[483:39.41]I will.
[483:40.85]Thanks for the 250, Snoozing.
[483:42.89]Alright, Jeremy, you need to shut the fuck up for a second.
[483:45.01]Sorry, I'm riled up.
[483:46.66]I love you, but seriously.
[483:48.20]Chat's gonna back me up on this.
[483:50.42]Nobody cares if you beat Disco LCM on stream, but you have to play it on stream.
[483:54.62]Have to.
[483:54.98]Remember how fun the sorcery streams were?
[483:57.00]You have to do it.
[484:01.78]I mean... When you say, when you say, when you bring sorcery to this... I mean... You're kind of comparing... I mean, I don't know, you're comparing like Mozart to something.
[484:21.91]Is this as good as Mozart?
[484:28.34]That's tricky.
[484:29.80]Do you tell me Disco Elysium is the equivalent of being as good as Sorcery, which is the Mozart of these games?
[484:40.27]I have to look into that.
[484:41.09]It's a bold statement.
[484:45.39]Well, that only works until I press the button that turns off right now.
[484:48.27]Good night, guys.
[484:48.81]See you tomorrow.
[485:11.78]What time?
[485:13.56]Somewhere around 2 p.m.
[485:14.26]Pacific.
[485:14.84]2 p.m.
[485:16.78]Pacific.
[485:17.26]Looking for Tony Hawk's Pro Skater Underground or Outer Wilds.
[485:24.84]Thanks, Nearshoot, for the 300 bits.
[485:26.14]I did it.
[485:26.48]You did?
[485:27.68]Thank you.
