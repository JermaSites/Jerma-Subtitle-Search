[ve:60.16.100]

[00:28.80]I wasn't really ready to start, but somebody in the chat, I don't know who it was, took my advice and they ate pea soup and are having some bed rest, which is the cure for every single problem in the world.
[00:40.55]So I was compelled to stream.
[00:43.68]I had to just press the button and turn it on.
[00:47.60]I was aware of feeling somebody had some pea soup consumption and they were in their bed.
[00:53.10]Hi, how are you doing?
[00:59.71]You know who I am.
[01:00.51]Do I even need to introduce myself anymore?
[01:04.01]I should start saying different names every time.
[01:08.15]But... We're gonna play more Far Cry 5.
[01:10.75]Talix is here.
[01:11.91]He's currently starting his video broadcasting device.
[01:16.16]And mine's already on.
[01:18.20]So, one more night here in Far Cry 5.
[01:23.12]And then something else is gonna happen tomorrow.
[01:26.60]Don't miss tomorrow's stream.
[01:29.16]If you've got something to do, then go ahead and do it.
[01:32.90]You could watch something else.
[01:33.76]You don't have to watch mine.
[01:36.56]But it's probably a stream you're not going to want to miss.
[01:40.52]If I was to take a wild guess.
[01:44.03]Or maybe not.
[01:44.47]Maybe you don't care.
[01:46.41]But... No pre-recorded stream tomorrow.
[01:56.05]Fuck you.
[01:57.63]Why?
[02:01.20]What did I do?
[02:03.70]Very glad to be joining you for the first time in a very long time after a long and tiring work day.
[02:08.56]Excited to see you play this.
[02:09.56]Thanks, man.
[02:16.20]Hey.
[02:17.92]So let's just wait for Italics.
[02:20.15]Give us a minute or so.
[02:20.77]I'm going to make a tweet.
[02:22.73]See you in a minute.
[03:08.73]Let's do that thing again, where I can't send a tweet.
[03:11.63]I swear to God.
[03:12.35]I don't know why I can't send tweets.
[03:17.54]Am I using too much internet?
[03:18.88]Is that the problem?
[03:21.86]Maybe.
[03:23.62]Let's try it again.
[03:27.57]Oh, there we go.
[03:28.33]I lost connection to the host.
[03:32.23]Um... Huh?
[03:36.71]Maybe we took too long?
[03:38.73]We'll have to see when he gets here.
[03:40.11]Let me try again.
[03:47.74]We'll just sit here for a minute.
[03:54.30]Sometimes it happens when I turn on my PS4.
[03:57.40]I'm playing on PC.
[03:59.02]But connection problems happen all the time.
[04:03.36]Also, I'm not feeling that great.
[04:05.76]It's been kind of a
[04:08.35]A trend, I know.
[04:09.25]Oh, hold on.
[04:13.77]I've been getting really bad fucking migraines lately.
[04:21.29]Sometimes I go on a spell on a string of these.
[04:24.69]Where I just, I wake up with a headache every single day.
[04:28.97]It's really, really annoying, actually.
[04:34.29]There we go, it worked now.
[04:35.57]Okay.
[04:39.35]You too?
[04:40.07]It's just, it sucks.
[04:40.91]It's really, it's a bit irritating.
[04:45.85]All right, let's, is Alex still not ready?
[04:51.58]What is he doing?
[04:56.12]Just move over.
[04:57.36]See, it's funny, I can't continue my game because it's all on his, like, I have to play on his computer, essentially.
[05:06.76]If you play Far Cry 5, by the way, if you don't know this, if you play Far Cry 5 with a friend, make sure it's a friend that you're going to keep talking to.
[05:16.11]Make sure it's a friend of yours that isn't going to just play for like 10 minutes and be like, you know what, I'm done.
[05:21.79]Because you don't get your game saved if you play on their host, if they're hosting and you play on their game.
[05:28.41]So make sure you, like, are in good terms with this friend you're gonna play with.
[05:32.41]And, like, you know, don't... Don't, like, do anything bad.
[05:35.61]Don't make this guy hate you because he's not gonna play with you the next day.
[05:43.66]Drink tons of water.
[05:44.80]Oh, I'm drinking coconut water.
[05:47.20]I'm filling my body with potassium as much as I can.
[05:51.14]We're going on a potassium binge.
[05:56.67]Have I been keeping up with crypto lately?
[05:58.99]yeah that's not right that's a big deal so what's the big deal I mean what's gonna happen what's the big deal what happened okay
[06:23.02]dropped the entire... I just got straight disconnected.
[06:26.84]Oh, wait a minute.
[06:27.64]Sorry, nobody could even hear what you were saying because I was just talking to myself for no reason.
[06:31.54]Oh, you got disconnected because my internet died.
[06:35.38]It's my turn.
[06:36.32]It's your turn to have a lot of fun.
[06:38.67]But it seems okay now.
[06:39.97]I don't know what the hiccup was, but I will re-invite you.
[06:43.77]Okay.
[06:44.19]And then we can get started.
[06:45.59]We can get started with Far Cry 5.
[06:48.23]Mountain men, go in the mountains!
[06:51.17]Are you sending me that invitation?
[06:54.54]There it is.
[06:55.36]Get started with the not allowed to have a smooth beginning to a stream.
[07:01.20]Me and Italics are going to move in together.
[07:04.07]And we're going to pay for enterprise internet.
[07:07.43]It's going to cost thousands of dollars.
[07:10.51]We're going to build a fiber line.
[07:13.39]And we're going to be the only ones who can use it.
[07:16.92]Yeah, we're gonna build on fiberline infrastructure, and only me and you can use it.
[07:22.22]Yeah.
[07:22.88]Out of the entire neighborhood.
[07:24.28]No, and I'm talking about the entire, like, the entire state, wherever we are.
[07:29.21]That's gonna cost, like, $500,000 a month.
[07:31.39]But, I mean, whatever.
[07:32.35]You see how many bits I got last time?
[07:33.81]I got, like... I got, like, at least $100 in bits last time.
[07:37.79]So, I mean, you gotta figure that... That's at least two square footage.
[07:40.59]That's at least, like, two square feet of build.
[07:42.91]Pfft.
[07:45.65]You see how many bits I had?
[07:47.33]Tear up some concrete, you know, we can probably rent like a like a madcap controller for that.
[07:54.33]What are like the cat, like the bulldozers called?
[07:59.43]Yeah, the cat.
[08:00.33]The rental construction like cat.
[08:02.19]Yeah, the cat five rental construction.
[08:05.39]You know what I'm talking about, though, right?
[08:07.03]Yeah, I know what you mean.
[08:07.67]They're called like, they're called carbines at night.
[08:11.04]Oh, God.
[08:12.18]We're starting that already.
[08:13.66]Okay.
[08:15.35]All right, so this time, what we're going to do this time is we were like, you know what?
[08:19.90]We've been neglecting very badly the story missions.
[08:24.56]And we want to make sure you guys can see the story because it is by far the most negatively rated thing in the whole game.
[08:30.82]So we want to make sure we showcase it.
[08:32.46]Oh, yeah.
[08:33.16]Before we go, do you have money in the game?
[08:37.62]Do I have any in-game money?
[08:38.34]Do you have in-game bits?
[08:39.77]Let me see.
[08:40.03]How many bits do I have?
[08:41.01]I got $82. $82.
[08:43.35]That's just enough money.
[08:44.23]That's almost enough money to dig one square footage of free internet for life.
[08:48.55]Like, let's try one mission.
[08:51.09]It doesn't have to be the first one.
[08:53.35]One mission with, like, silencers or, like, stealth.
[08:56.51]I thought you were saying let's do one mission in silence.
[08:59.79]Let's do one mission where we just communicate telepathically.
[09:03.43]Okay, let's do it.
[09:04.87]Let's do one mission in silence, okay?
[09:08.86]Should that be the first mission, though?
[09:10.90]I mean, it could be.
[09:15.73]Do you want to do a mission in silence?
[09:17.83]We'll save that for mission two.
[09:19.31]Mission two is in silence.
[09:21.29]Otherwise, everyone's going to think the stream is broken.
[09:23.25]Yes, everyone's going to trickle in here over the next 20-30 minutes and be like, what are these guys doing?
[09:28.98]We'll do one mission in silence.
[09:29.92]They're only going to hear keyboard sounds.
[09:31.14]Mechanical keyboard.
[09:33.54]Keyboard sounds and the occasional...
[09:40.09]Now, the real question is what constitutes a story mission on the map.
[09:44.45]Did I not kill that guy?
[09:45.47]I just killed the car.
[09:46.41]I just headshot the car.
[09:47.41]Okay, can you drive?
[09:49.15]Well, I'm trying to find a waypoint.
[09:51.33]How does that not shoot that guy?
[09:53.54]I'm so confused.
[09:57.10]Okay, I'm turning auto-drive on for a second.
[10:01.02]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[10:03.82]I'm not controlling the car, so good luck.
[10:05.94]I think we've got some really good Wi-Fi here right now.
[10:07.76]That's true.
[10:12.62]Why is this guy standing up?
[10:13.48]Did someone just fall on my screen?
[10:19.43]Okay, we definitely don't have a good connection to each other right now.
[10:23.75]Am I a robot?
[10:25.05]No, I'm talking about like in the game.
[10:27.83]And you're driving very slowly in the game.
[10:29.62]That's because I have auto-drive on for a second.
[10:31.76]Okay, coming back.
[10:33.58]Can you turn off the radio?
[10:34.60]This is giving me a fucking headache.
[10:36.50]Speaking of the radio, there actually is copywritten music in this game.
[10:40.21]Oh, is there?
[10:40.79]And I saw a tweet that said, hey, by the way, if you make YouTube or Twitch videos, be careful about not getting copyright strikes.
[10:47.77]Oh.
[10:48.85]So you've got to turn it off.
[10:51.07]I did.
[10:53.81]It didn't turn off for me.
[10:55.41]Well, you've got to turn your own radio off.
[10:57.05]Oh, what the fuck?
[10:58.05]It's left bracket.
[10:59.22]I know.
[10:59.50]I just pressed it.
[11:00.18]It's not working.
[11:00.88]What's the key bind?
[11:03.14]It's absolutely left bracket.
[11:04.70]Oh, my God.
[11:05.82]Going on a road trip.
[11:08.96]I hope you're going to enjoy this music.
[11:11.04]It's probably a fast travel over there.
[11:17.25]I'm going to jail.
[11:18.77]Watch out for the pig.
[11:19.69]Was that a pig?
[11:20.67]That was a pig, yeah.
[11:21.47]I didn't know there were even pigs in the game.
[11:23.63]What is... Are you stopping for this?
[11:27.37]Are we getting shot at?
[11:28.77]Well, I know we're getting shot at, but the civilian pulled right in front of those guys, and I wanted to see what he was going to do.
[11:33.27]And that's a tractor.
[11:36.41]All right, I just got to see.
[11:38.50]I have to get out of this car before I start to praise Jesus.
[11:46.05]Uh, I can't get away from the music.
[11:48.36]Is the music playing inside of my head?
[11:49.90]I don't know what's happening.
[11:54.10]Why do I have a Walkman on?
[11:56.20]Oh my god, it's fucking with my game.
[12:02.33]I can't kill him.
[12:03.29]He's killing you though.
[12:07.17]You okay down there?
[12:07.97]It's a good first start.
[12:09.59]Do you have like a music implant or something?
[12:13.91]Are you still hearing the radio?
[12:15.26]I think I'm just still hearing the radio.
[12:22.02]Yeah, that was bad.
[12:24.14]Good luck killing that armored machine gunner with your pistol.
[12:28.73]Dude, I wish you could turn the fucking music off in this game.
[12:31.47]That'd be nice.
[12:38.91]It's okay, they turned it off.
[12:40.59]Okay, let's complain about this game for a second.
[12:43.83]Let's complain about Far Cry 5.
[12:45.67]So guys, if you don't know, Far Cry 5, I just want to show it to you.
[12:48.53]Far Cry 5 has an insane, incredibly immense options menu that it shows you in real time in the video menu.
[12:55.98]So texture filtering, I can see in real time this changing.
[13:00.14]Very, very, very elaborate settings here.
[13:03.08]It's great.
[13:03.44]You can see exactly what it's going to do to your game when you change the... Let's go to the audio settings.
[13:09.56]Master volume 23.
[13:12.64]Do you want any master volume on?
[13:17.18]Where's like everything else?
[13:19.36]Oh, there it is.
[13:21.41]It's off now.
[13:22.29]No more music.
[13:27.43]That's a lie.
[13:27.81]Yeah, but I don't care about the music, but does the music have to be as loud as everything else in the whole game?
[13:38.91]And... didn't even work.
[13:43.71]So everybody that's calling me an idiot right now, listen to the music that's still playing.
[13:51.44]Um... Oh, what's that?
[13:54.68]Oh, Gerber the Moron?
[13:56.52]Gerber the fucking Moron?
[13:59.68]Go!
[14:00.56]Oh!
[14:01.58]That's a bear.
[14:05.24]How's the bear getting in the car?
[14:06.31]Alright, push left bracket.
[14:12.38]I feel like I hear a different song than you do.
[14:14.31]Jesus is in your head.
[14:16.07]All right, let me turn around.
[14:22.59]Turn with the moron.
[14:24.41]Why is this?
[14:27.24]You want to put a new thing on for us?
[14:31.10]Or is this where we're going?
[14:34.98]I think we need, there we go.
[14:43.79]Gerber the moron for the next rubble.
[14:45.31]We got guys behind us.
[14:51.80]They're just like, what?
[14:57.60]Can I?
[15:00.14]Alright, got him.
[15:03.94]I guess I got him.
[15:06.98]Wait, why are you... Oh, no.
[15:11.47]God damn it.
[15:12.73]Hold on.
[15:13.21]Wait, did I not get him?
[15:14.99]Oh, I got it.
[15:27.08]Why are we just in like... Yeah, what is going on right here?
[15:29.70]Grand Theft Auto, five stars.
[15:31.24]Okay, this is a character.
[15:33.00]We're being pursued by every police officer in the state.
[15:36.45]Yeah, that's the whole point.
[15:37.47]This is the AI director.
[15:39.05]Let's get this mission.
[15:41.95]This looks like a story mission, right?
[15:46.15]Don't kill her because we'll break the game.
[15:49.76]The ones that don't get taught a hard lesson.
[15:54.15]You look like you're... You better... Yeah, you should have... Oh, my God.
[15:57.45]I didn't hurt her.
[15:58.09]You better stop what you're doing.
[16:04.00]I didn't hurt her.
[16:04.76]Get you.
[16:26.67]I like made her stop and she's got like, well, you're in a hurry, aren't you, buddy?
[16:30.55]Fine.
[16:30.89]I can't pick up the broom?
[16:35.59]Okay.
[16:37.35]Let's get in here.
[16:38.61]Hold on a minute.
[16:39.77]Can I spawn my airplane in here?
[16:44.78]That'd be kind of cool.
[16:46.72]No.
[16:47.58]Gotta go to a dock for that one.
[16:50.48]Alright, let's do it.
[16:59.80]Is there nothing faster we can take?
[17:01.03]Than this pickup?
[17:06.79]Are you dead?
[17:08.93]No, I'm trying to figure out how to turn the fucking radio up.
[17:11.83]I got a suggestion.
[17:13.36]Left bracket doesn't work.
[17:14.16]It's called get on the ATV.
[17:14.92]You want to get on the ATV.
[17:16.12]Left bracket doesn't turn the radio off.
[17:17.90]It does for me when I'm in the driver's seat.
[17:19.42]I don't know why.
[17:24.29]So her quest is to get the Widowmaker, which is a truck, I think.
[17:30.41]Okay.
[17:31.19]Do we have to get it from the garage?
[17:33.95]Uh, 98 meters that way.
[17:34.83]Let's go take a look.
[17:35.69]Well, that's because I put a thing there.
[17:39.04]Where's the actual quest on the map?
[17:41.00]Maybe we do.
[17:41.40]I think we do have to take something.
[17:42.34]I actually like that sound.
[17:47.82]I just tracked the quest.
[17:49.38]Oh, okay.
[17:49.76]Here we go.
[17:50.32]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[17:54.15]No more radio.
[17:55.29]Yeah, I wish the song that was playing in the menus was the default music that you could make.
[18:00.48]I like the menu music.
[18:01.62]It's great.
[18:02.66]Yeah.
[18:03.46]The calming like banjo.
[18:09.00]People kept telling us to go to the yes sign yesterday.
[18:11.10]Let's do that sometime today.
[18:12.69]Okay.
[18:12.81]I'm down for the yes sign.
[18:15.13]To the left.
[18:17.77]You want to rescue these people?
[18:19.17]No.
[18:22.85]No, not really.
[18:24.19]Sorry, guys.
[18:25.07]Maybe next time.
[18:29.85]Nice, good shooting.
[18:31.56]Just checking out my new automatic sniper rifle.
[18:35.26]Watch out for the dog.
[18:36.92]Yeah, you had to do it, didn't you?
[18:40.08]You had to kill that dog.
[18:42.06]That was a wolf.
[18:42.94]What are you talking about?
[18:43.99]I'm not on anymore.
[18:49.15]How are you not on anymore?
[18:51.09]Because when you went through all that calamity, I decided we were rolling around.
[18:57.81]I was on all four wheels the entire time.
[19:00.17]I don't know how you didn't hit your head and die.
[19:05.57]That was an absolute smash your head and die scenario.
[19:09.50]Taking a shortcut.
[19:11.60]I'm okay with it.
[19:19.34]It's faster than any road.
[19:22.14]It is actually the fastest route to get there.
[19:24.84]And we're on an all-terrain vehicle.
[19:27.85]I was trying to go backwards.
[19:29.13]That's okay.
[19:31.17]You doing good?
[19:31.71]What's happening up here?
[19:33.81]Are they shooting at a bear?
[19:38.57]Yes.
[19:41.43]What?
[19:42.31]How did that even happen?
[19:43.49]You just became one of the NPCs.
[19:46.11]Oh, come on.
[19:46.85]No, no, no.
[19:48.59]Wait, what?
[19:49.47]Who is this?
[19:51.52]This is not you?
[19:53.16]I'm so confused right now.
[19:59.01]Will you please help me here?
[20:02.42]Where did he go?
[20:03.00]I keep reviving this guy for him to die.
[20:08.90]I helped, I think.
[20:10.54]Okay, I thought that was you, but why... Why couldn't we revive that guy?
[20:17.80]I don't know, but the bear is dead.
[20:19.77]I had to just use a little TNT.
[20:22.03]He's fine, though.
[20:23.65]I don't know why that guy was not killable, but apparently I don't even have the right... I don't even have the same weapon.
[20:29.16]What happened to my sniper rifle?
[20:30.32]Alright, we found our first companion.
[20:37.73]Where is my sniper rifle?
[20:39.68]We just saved this guy.
[20:40.92]Why did I get a new gun?
[20:43.58]We've got our newest scot stone.
[20:47.67]Wait a minute.
[20:48.55]That guy has my gun.
[20:49.63]Does he?
[20:51.69]I think he does, yeah.
[20:53.85]No, this is my friend.
[20:54.79]I want that gun.
[20:55.51]That's my gun.
[20:56.11]He's my gun for hire.
[20:57.19]I just paid this man.
[20:58.38]I suppose I should say thanks.
[21:01.24]You're welcome.
[21:02.12]Does he not have my gun anymore?
[21:03.36]Did he delete it?
[21:05.12]Maybe he's in his back pocket, you know?
[21:06.94]He's got an inventory, too.
[21:08.78]That thing was like $2,000.
[21:10.16]It's okay.
[21:12.84]You can get another one from the gunsmith.
[21:14.74]He'll give you a new one.
[21:18.93]Are we ready?
[21:19.31]What are you throwing?
[21:20.17]I just want to make sure.
[21:21.12]I'm trying.
[21:21.36]He doesn't have my gun anymore.
[21:23.50]He doesn't have my gun anymore.
[21:26.76]Okay.
[21:27.54]He's on our team now, so he's going to be with us at the next mission.
[21:30.90]Right.
[21:35.33]Scotch stone.
[21:36.85]Bear survivor.
[21:37.51]I'm going to hunt this deer.
[21:46.52]Drive up next to the deer.
[21:47.28]I'm going to hunt it with a bow.
[21:48.93]I'm getting there.
[21:49.39]I'm close.
[21:50.57]You are close.
[21:51.07]We're also getting shot at simultaneously.
[21:53.51]No, it's all right.
[21:56.01]They have to come get us in the woods, which, as you can see, that's not a good idea to drive through the woods for the exact purpose that you just saw.
[22:03.32]We're only 500 meters away.
[22:05.28]I don't know what's happening, but there you go.
[22:07.00]There's a helicopter here.
[22:07.84]There is a helicopter.
[22:08.98]We're there, though.
[22:10.28]Are we there?
[22:10.70]We should at least take the helicopter there.
[22:14.34]I think that's an enemy helicopter.
[22:17.90]This doesn't seem good.
[22:19.18]Run away.
[22:19.62]Go.
[22:20.28]Run away.
[22:20.64]What do you mean, run away?
[22:21.44]The helicopter's on fire!
[22:25.86]And I have no medpacks.
[22:27.90]You took a while to tell me that.
[22:30.04]I said, get out!
[22:31.36]You said, get out.
[22:32.02]You said, get out.
[22:32.52]But, excuse me, you need to say... I need to know why.
[22:34.58]I thought you were just being a coward.
[22:42.06]You should have said, get out, the car is going to explode in less than 10 seconds.
[22:47.02]Like if a sniper was going to take you out, and I yelled, get down!
[22:50.37]You'd yell, why?
[22:52.25]I'm going to need you to go through my secretary first before I comply with your very loud, explicit instructions.
[23:00.91]It's over.
[23:01.33]He's done.
[23:02.02]See you later.
[23:02.54]I think there's a guy still in here.
[23:10.13]In the helicopter?
[23:10.91]No, never mind.
[23:12.87]This is a compound.
[23:13.69]This is like a giant elevator grain outpost.
[23:16.83]I'm going to try and be sneaky even though they set off the alarm.
[23:19.73]Because it was really the helicopter's fault.
[23:25.12]Where is this guy that can see me?
[23:26.38]There's a guy right there.
[23:28.62]I'm going to go on top of the elevator and try to mark some enemies.
[23:34.45]What do we got?
[23:35.50]I got spotted.
[23:36.26]I got spotted.
[23:37.20]It's alright.
[23:38.56]I'm just taking people out left and right.
[23:40.74]Not a big deal.
[23:47.52]Oh, come on.
[23:47.98]That's not a hit?
[23:51.16]Alright.
[23:51.98]I need some markers here.
[23:53.34]You know, I love my sniper rifle wherever that stupid AI is.
[23:57.33]He took the gun that I purchased and he's just walking around up there.
[24:00.07]He took it and then ran away.
[24:01.67]He's actually sniping with it though.
[24:05.21]He's probably doing a pretty good job, honestly.
[24:07.02]No, he's not.
[24:07.58]Yeah, you're not supposed to close the gap with a sniper rifle.
[24:10.90]Oh my God, what a dummy.
[24:12.64]He's probably following me.
[24:16.12]I'm getting wrecked over here.
[24:17.72]He's getting wrecked.
[24:18.32]I'm getting wrecked over here.
[24:19.46]Wait, I'm not supposed to drive?
[24:20.82]All right, I'm just, whatever.
[24:27.84]All right, I'm at the very top of the outpost.
[24:35.36]What the fuck is he thinking?
[24:38.95]Oh my god.
[24:39.87]What a moron.
[24:40.77]Can I please get my gun now?
[24:46.97]I want my gun.
[24:48.59]That's not it.
[24:50.80]That's not my gun either.
[24:52.44]Give me that gun!
[24:54.02]No, he took somebody's gun off the ground!
[24:55.92]Where the fuck is my gun that he... It's somewhere down here.
[25:01.79]I put like a scope on it.
[25:02.75]That was like a $2,000 scope.
[25:03.33]There's a scoped gun up here at the top.
[25:06.20]It's the same one.
[25:07.14]Is it the same one?
[25:07.76]Are you sure?
[25:08.24]Yeah, it's the exact same one.
[25:17.88]Alright, I'm up here.
[25:20.33]Where is it?
[25:22.27]All the way at the tippy top.
[25:23.25]All the way at the tippy top.
[25:24.43]So that you can snipe with it from up here, you know?
[25:26.39]It's like in a convenient gamer place.
[25:29.83]How does he climb?
[25:37.85]I feel like we both, all three of us should not be up here.
[25:41.03]I got down, so you're fine up there.
[25:42.46]Oh, okay.
[25:43.36]I'm going.
[25:45.48]Well, we did it.
[25:45.96]I got the last guy.
[25:48.90]Okay, you got your gun?
[25:50.20]Are you happy now?
[25:50.96]I didn't get my gun.
[25:52.25]I got right to the top.
[25:53.21]I was looking at the gun and we got into a cutscene.
[25:55.19]So now I'm gonna have to go all the way up to the fucking top of that tower again to pick up that gun again.
[25:59.57]I was in sights.
[26:00.53]I had it in my hands.
[26:01.51]I could smell it and then now it's over.
[26:03.53]Look, there's a gunsmith at the, like, right there.
[26:05.85]Just go talk to him and get your gun back, you baby.
[26:08.97]Thank God.
[26:09.47]That's what I'm talking about.
[26:11.65]This beauty.
[26:18.26]This guy right here.
[26:19.60]Okay.
[26:22.90]You're still up there.
[26:30.06]What?
[26:30.76]I think I just shot between your legs.
[26:32.24]I was going to say, why am I hurt?
[26:35.18]Oh, no.
[26:35.45]I must have hit your legs then.
[26:36.47]Okay.
[26:37.05]This is a thing to blow up up here.
[26:39.29]Is it safe to blow up?
[26:41.55]There's a way to pick it.
[26:42.31]Do you have perk points to just pick it instead?
[26:44.15]Because you get more stuff if you don't blow it up.
[26:45.99]Oh, you do.
[26:46.37]Okay.
[26:46.59]Let me see if I have any perk points.
[26:50.10]It's one of the early ones.
[26:51.96]Alright.
[26:54.64]Let me take a look here, though.
[26:56.10]Additional holster, third weapon.
[26:58.74]Can carry more arrows.
[27:00.94]More SMG and shotgun.
[27:02.68]Carry more items.
[27:04.92]Hold on a sec.
[27:08.12]More sturdy.
[27:11.78]Stealthy lockpick safes and doors.
[27:14.88]That's a lot.
[27:18.85]Throwback.
[27:23.04]Ghost.
[27:26.30]Okay, I like that.
[27:28.10]I like this too.
[27:31.34]Automatically repairing vehicles.
[27:32.72]That's pretty cool.
[27:35.33]Heavy weapons mastery.
[27:36.71]Weapons pro.
[27:39.73]Vehicle buster.
[27:41.91]Hmm.
[27:43.85]Saboteur.
[27:47.91]I like that.
[27:48.51]That's kind of cool.
[27:50.59]Black market.
[27:53.67]Health boost one.
[27:54.47]That's a pretty big deal.
[27:58.44]Swim faster, who cares.
[27:59.66]Repair torch is good.
[28:01.50]Can open safes with this too.
[28:02.56]It's only five.
[28:03.18]Yeah.
[28:05.16]Let's get it.
[28:08.97]And then I'm also gonna do... I'm gonna save the rest.
[28:13.43]So how do I get that out?
[28:19.19]How do I pull out the blowtorch?
[28:27.35]Tal-X?
[28:31.09]Okay, there we are.
[28:33.23]Fishing.
[28:34.45]Blowtorch.
[28:47.67]$1,000.
[28:49.07]Can you burn people with this?
[28:50.45]Like in Battlefield?
[28:51.13]And that was like the really funny joke everybody did in Battlefield.
[28:54.23]What are you doing?
[28:55.60]I thought this guy's name was Scott Slime.
[28:59.65]Fuckers got me!
[29:00.95]What the fuck are you doing?
[29:02.01]You can burn people.
[29:04.95]God damn it, that hurts!
[29:07.90]Fuckers got me!
[29:09.06]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[29:23.52]Alright, where are you?
[29:24.99]I'm just fucking with our friend over here.
[29:28.13]I saw somebody was hunting you.
[29:29.69]Fucking Scott Slime.
[29:32.11]Alright, are you ready to rock and roll?
[29:33.89]He's coming with me.
[29:34.93]He's not following you anymore.
[29:38.18]God's my friend.
[29:38.94]Can I pet the dog?
[29:40.00]Yes.
[29:40.34]Hello.
[29:45.37]So, buy like a silencer for your gun.
[29:49.45]Yeah, I need to... Do the sell loot thing, and if you have like... Yeah, I already did.
[29:54.44]Alright, weapons.
[29:56.42]Let's get a silencer on this sniper rifle.
[30:01.04]There we go.
[30:01.44]A silencer is too much money.
[30:02.94]I can't afford it.
[30:04.72]Wow.
[30:06.00]I just got like $3,000.
[30:06.86]I have a really good scope, though.
[30:13.00]Alright, who's flying?
[30:14.30]What is... Oh, yeah.
[30:14.92]I thought that was Scott's Limer doing that again.
[30:16.94]Alright, Scott's the guy in the cockpit now.
[30:19.74]I'm coming up here.
[30:20.72]What's next on the mission list?
[30:23.72]That was not the mission.
[30:24.84]That was just in the way.
[30:26.76]Yeah.
[30:31.65]Trying to get on top the other way.
[30:32.77]Alright, let's go.
[30:34.29]I was trying to knock you off with the tail.
[30:36.01]Fuckers got me!
[30:36.89]Alright, so we're gonna do...
[30:42.83]Like a set down.
[30:44.17]Because if we just try and land on top of them, we are going to get blown up again and just have to run back over there.
[30:50.72]So where do you want to sit down?
[30:55.00]I would say just get in a position where you think we're going to be safe.
[30:58.98]How about right here?
[31:03.09]I like it.
[31:05.93]Okay.
[31:10.94]Why does this guy have bird fur on his face?
[31:14.70]He's got bird feathers all over him.
[31:16.08]Bird fur?
[31:16.52]Okay, listen, not all, not everybody's endowed with, like, great chops, you know what I mean?
[31:22.78]He does what he can with what he's got.
[31:24.82]Take the shot.
[31:25.46]No, I'm not gonna take the shot.
[31:26.64]That would've been annoying.
[31:28.12]That would've been annoying for us.
[31:33.68]If you did what?
[31:35.36]If I shot him in the head in the helicopter and he, like, slumped out, that would've been bad.
[31:40.77]So do we want... Okay, we'll stick with Scott for now.
[31:43.49]You stick with Scott's line.
[31:44.53]Or do you want another companion?
[31:47.32]Like... I mean, everyone's going to say Diana.
[31:49.40]But, I mean, you know.
[31:51.46]I'm biased.
[31:53.39]I'm in like...
[31:54.94]Didn't we rescue the bear?
[31:56.54]I guess not.
[31:57.14]Cheeseburger's not available, it says.
[31:58.93]Wait, the bear's name is Cheeseburger?
[32:03.17]The bear's name is Cheeseburger, quote, the fearsome grizzly is his name.
[32:08.07]Well, I just shot the guy in the head.
[32:09.01]Just be careful.
[32:10.45]Watch out for the alarm.
[32:11.13]Okay, there's a VIP.
[32:18.04]Huh?
[32:18.42]Well, you have fun with that.
[32:20.76]I just shot this guy in the head.
[32:25.94]I'll be over here.
[32:28.86]Sneaky combat stealth.
[32:36.79]Oh, come on, really?
[32:40.71]Come on, how is that fence protection?
[32:43.07]That chain link fence, you would die if you got shot through a chain link fence.
[32:48.45]You would.
[32:48.87]Oh, fucking Jesus.
[32:51.58]All right.
[33:00.60]Still undetected.
[33:01.36]They're all coming after me.
[33:03.04]I know.
[33:03.22]I'm taking them down from behind.
[33:04.66]I got some help.
[33:06.36]Well, that guy's running.
[33:10.13]I can't shoot through that?
[33:10.89]Apparently I can.
[33:13.87]Okay.
[33:14.67]Got one.
[33:15.17]Did you get the bad guy?
[33:19.09]Yeah, I think this place is pretty clear.
[33:21.15]You did a good job of distracting them.
[33:22.93]I can't believe.
[33:24.75]Okay, so it can go through.
[33:27.95]Were you just shooting only the chain bits and not any of the gap in between?
[33:31.53]I must have been.
[33:35.07]These are like 400 caliber bullets.
[33:36.72]They would go through a chain link fence.
[33:39.62]By the way, I thought that was a goat.
[33:41.30]I was like, where did we get the goat?
[33:43.24]Let me explain.
[33:44.72]Right there, this looked like goat horns when I was back here and I saw the dog was right in this area.
[33:50.28]Right on top of his head when I scoped in, it looked like a goat.
[33:52.74]Just pull it back and rewind and get it in the perfect frame.
[33:54.28]You'll see it.
[33:58.94]Alright, so what do we get inside here?
[34:01.04]Apparently.
[34:03.10]It says the warehouse will remain locked.
[34:05.84]If you need to get inside, find the key in the workshop tent.
[34:09.08]Okay.
[34:09.80]But check with the Baptist before using.
[34:12.27]So workshop tent.
[34:14.31]We're now playing a horror game where you have to find the key to open the next door.
[34:17.79]Okay.
[34:21.37]Workshop tent.
[34:22.21]That looks like a key.
[34:23.53]What the fuck?
[34:25.45]What?
[34:29.19]Did you do that?
[34:29.79]I did.
[34:30.81]Oh, my God.
[34:31.69]What the fuck, man?
[34:32.73]That's right, Boomer.
[34:41.46]That was something I never would have expected would ever happen.
[34:44.00]Yeah uh you just like- you just killed me.
[34:46.00]I may have actually died right there. I- you know and like you know like how they say quantum death? Whatever that thing is. I just quantum died.
[34:53.00]Like one of the me's died right there. Yeah, I'm serious.
[34:57.00]In like a- in like another parallel universe.
[34:59.00]Yeah in one of the like 400 trillion scenarios of what could have happened right there.
[35:01.00]Your consciousness just transferred to another parallel universe.
[35:05.00]I thought this was booby trapped or something I just never expected that - that was a scream I'm sorry everybody.
[35:12.58]Alright, so- Seemed like a good opportunity.
[35:14.48]Hold on, keep him there.
[35:18.14]Oh, that's too bad.
[35:22.14]Alright, I got the key.
[35:23.22]I don't know why.
[35:27.97]There was a world in which this worked.
[35:29.69]God damn it, now I have a headache.
[35:31.73]I really thought that that was a booby-trapped chest or something, but it wasn't even a chest, I took a key and blew up.
[35:39.07]Did it blow up, like, right when you picked the key up?
[35:41.15]I grabbed the key and was like, oh, I got the key.
[35:42.77]Kaboom!
[35:46.61]Oh, look at this.
[35:48.11]This is going to be fun.
[35:48.89]Nice twisted metal truck.
[35:50.65]Optimus Prime.
[35:54.61]That Transformers is still relevant, right?
[35:56.71]I want to see this.
[35:57.71]I want to watch this.
[35:58.65]I just need to see, like, how... I want to see how much of a coward I am.
[36:03.03]Oh, you're going to watch the clip.
[36:05.67]Yeah, yeah.
[36:06.31]It was seriously, like...
[36:08.39]You, you just like, you just punched me in the face.
[36:11.33]That's like what happened.
[36:12.01]Alright, I'm ready.
[36:18.61]Uh, you want to drive?
[36:20.15]Yeah.
[36:23.87]Sure.
[36:24.78]It's just you going... It worked.
[36:33.04]It worked.
[36:35.04]Where's the dog?
[36:37.37]Okay, this opens up some new possibilities.
[36:40.43]Switch weapons?
[36:41.49]You can actually lean out of a car door and use melee weapons.
[36:45.61]Can you really?
[36:46.11]Yeah.
[36:47.03]So we have to do the mailbox joke, right?
[36:49.82]Yeah, it's the mailbox joke.
[36:56.40]I didn't realize you had 50 cal machine guns in the front.
[36:59.08]Yeah, I got like 50,000 caliber machine gun.
[37:02.34]All right, so let's go this way.
[37:07.23]I've only got, like, a Uzi.
[37:09.21]That's my only gun.
[37:10.92]We need to find a way to do a thing where you hit somebody in the head.
[37:14.66]Leaning off with your... Leaning with your... Yes, I know what you're trying to say.
[37:22.74]I can't look.
[37:23.48]Where you pull the melee weapon out, and as I drive by, you hit someone in the head.
[37:27.61]Exactly.
[37:28.35]And I couldn't say that because I was driving and shooting at the same time.
[37:31.95]So I was useless in linguistics.
[37:35.44]Do the thing where you have.
[37:36.72]Do the thing where you have.
[37:38.32]Do the thing where you have.
[37:39.82]The processor power is maxed.
[37:43.04]This is a pretty cool truck, yeah.
[37:43.98]It's like our own TIE Fighter, you know what I mean?
[37:54.24]I love Star Wars.
[37:55.18]Oh, X-Wing.
[37:55.62]It's got the same shot pattern as an X-Wing.
[37:57.59]No, we're the bad guys.
[37:59.93]Stay the TIE Fighter.
[38:06.57]431, 430, 404!
[38:06.63]The German was never the same after his quantum death.
[38:17.25]I mean, I could, if I really wanted to.
[38:32.75]No, don't do the Spanish beat.
[38:34.36]Why?
[38:38.28]Now it's just gonna be in everyone's head for the rest of the night.
[38:40.56]Oh, but you don't want me to do the beat?
[38:41.74]Come on, I'm gonna do that beat!
[38:43.84]Wait till we get some silence.
[38:45.69]Aw, he pulled the horn.
[38:46.91]Oh god.
[38:47.71]No, it's gotta be quiet.
[39:08.38]I'll get it.
[39:10.76]I bet you could type in do-do-do-do in YouTube when it comes up with the big tag.
[39:14.96]Why is it... I'm not under control anymore.
[39:16.88]Why not?
[39:17.20]Did you put shift?
[39:18.69]No.
[39:23.19]Come on, ram through the blockade!
[39:24.39]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[39:25.29]I just took a... Now drop that fucking sick beat!
[39:38.24]The weirdest part about it is it cuts all the other audio in the game out for that.
[39:43.84]Like the ambient noise goes down.
[39:45.56]It does.
[39:46.06]It really does.
[39:48.98]Who is shooting at us, though?
[39:51.26]Get out of here.
[39:57.13]What the fuck is this truck?
[40:00.33]It's the doot-a-doot truck.
[40:02.71]Oh, watch out for the bear.
[40:04.37]The bear's gone.
[40:05.21]Save them.
[40:06.17]Oh, no.
[40:08.29]How did I get hurt from that?
[40:10.23]I just got... I'm almost dead.
[40:12.15]You just gave him a free meal, though.
[40:14.26]I drove over everybody.
[40:15.46]Get out of the way.
[40:19.50]Alright, where are we even going?
[40:21.56]Oh, I think we're there.
[40:24.74]Or we're gonna be in a second.
[40:25.96]Because the lady that told us to pick it up is, like, here.
[40:32.09]Wait, I'm supposed to honk the horn.
[40:34.94]I'm on fire.
[40:35.66]Am I on fire?
[40:38.44]Turn the Widowmaker.
[40:39.24]Okay, where does it belong?
[40:42.16]Handbrake.
[40:44.00]You keep going down the... You just keep going down the way you were going before.
[40:47.59]Oh, goddammit.
[40:49.41]No, not yet.
[40:50.19]Hold on.
[40:52.75]Is there something else you want to do?
[40:54.07]Just temporarily.
[40:54.95]Just wait.
[40:55.67]You just killed the dog.
[40:56.55]The dog is dead.
[40:57.23]The dog literally died up there.
[41:01.72]By the way.
[41:07.04]Come on that was I had the whole song going there with the beeps I Killed the dog.
[41:17.82]Yeah, the dog's dead.
[41:19.38]He's gone.
[41:20.68]Oh Yeah, he was following behind us and you Didn't kill everybody at the bridge.
[41:26.14]So they killed the dog.
[41:27.44]Oh shit That's a good those are good guys.
[41:30.45]Oh
[41:32.83]Hence the icon above their head that allows us to interact with them.
[41:37.41]But I have a horn too.
[41:39.29]Yeah, you do.
[41:39.81]What do you want to do?
[41:41.01]What joke do you see?
[41:41.89]Just listen.
[41:42.33]Are you going to do like a... All right, so we both... You have to do all the sound effects of the truck and somebody in chat is going to turn it into like a... I wish you could hold the horn because it's hard to do it all at the same time.
[42:05.44]So I come to a complete stop.
[42:07.05]Can you do the horn?
[42:09.77]Now do the horn sound.
[42:11.93]Okay, now do the gun sound.
[42:15.89]Wait, hold on.
[42:18.47]No, hold on.
[42:23.74]Now do the beep beep backup sound.
[42:33.09]It's so hard to do this.
[42:37.05]Yeah, but somebody in the chat is gonna take all of those sound effects independently and they're gonna make like an actual beat.
[42:43.81]It's the party truck.
[43:05.03]We're supposed to park the truck right there.
[43:07.51]Party?
[43:07.97]You are not going to accomplish whatever you try.
[43:09.65]You can't fuck around with the party truck.
[43:12.53]Party truck comes into town.
[43:13.55]Watch out, though.
[43:14.57]It's dangerous.
[43:18.96]Now we're talking.
[43:22.96]Where do we bring it?
[43:23.84]Just into the garage?
[43:25.54]Yeah.
[43:27.44]Which one?
[43:27.92]This one?
[43:28.93]Where did Scott come from?
[43:30.75]I have to park here.

[44:07.71]Okay.
[44:07.81]Just like this.
[44:33.31]I'm so tempted.
[44:34.15]I'm trying to resist.
[44:35.01]Don't do it.
[44:38.45]Just wait.
[44:39.85]So that we can use that.
[44:42.27]I think we just unlocked that truck.
[44:44.49]Fuck!
[44:44.65]I didn't mean to do that.
[44:46.51]You want a sandwicher?
[44:47.99]No!
[44:48.26]God damn it!
[44:48.82]I'm trying... Excuse me, ma'am.
[44:51.86]He won't bother you again.
[44:52.84]You want a shovel sandwicher?
[44:55.08]In, like, when it's done?
[44:56.14]What?
[44:56.24]You want a shovel sandwicher when the... She's done.
[45:03.69]Shovel sandwich her.
[45:04.85]It's we both swing at the same time and I get one side of her head you get the other side of her head.
[45:07.99]That sounds... Sounds a little risque is all I'm saying.
[45:12.14]Well then let's do it to this guy.
[45:13.02]You want to shovel sandwich this guy?
[45:15.58]I'm gonna hit him on his left side of his face and you hit him on the right side of his face.
[45:20.42]I'm gonna go, wait, I'm gonna go... Is it left to right?
[45:23.07]Okay, so now I'm gonna go right to left.
[45:25.79]Okay.
[45:27.56]So, ready?
[45:29.14]One, two, three.
[45:31.07]Okay, well, I leaned forward to hit you.
[45:35.57]Yeah, you went, like, through him.
[45:37.83]We have to stand back a couple of steps because I want to do the power swing.
[45:41.03]So we have to get, like, queued up here.
[45:43.27]So I'm going to go... Are you ready?
[45:46.23]First try.
[45:47.19]We need to, like... First try.
[45:48.89]One.
[45:49.01]Queue it up.
[45:51.09]One, two, three.
[45:52.76]Don't aim that!
[45:56.57]Okay, it worked.
[45:57.37]I don't have a shovel, but the pipe will have to do.
[46:00.35]Let's go, bird boy.
[46:01.20]Alright, next mission!
[46:02.98]Hold on, I want to try some.
[46:09.96]Should I duck?
[46:10.80]How do you craft... I don't think I can craft throwing knives.
[46:15.65]Never mind.
[46:16.83]Do arrows come down?
[46:19.99]They might.
[46:20.35]Alright, you stand, like, down the street a little bit.
[46:25.24]You want to get an NPC to come over here?
[46:26.74]Wait a minute, who's... This plane is coming to get us.
[46:32.00]That's like a World War II fighter.
[46:35.04]Come on, let me get something good here.
[46:37.14]How deep is the bullet drop?
[46:41.14]What'd you say?
[46:41.52]I don't know, but that arrow was gone.
[46:47.86]I'll get him.
[46:49.99]I'm going to get him right through the cockpit.
[46:51.25]Oh, you're just going to shoot the pilot right now?
[46:57.30]Okay, there's a little bit of drop.
[46:58.24]Just in case he comes.
[47:03.16]Get him!
[47:05.10]You did not get him, no.
[47:07.52]Can you even shoot through the cockpit?
[47:10.90]I got hit with an arrow from that far away!
[47:14.96]While he was on the move.
[47:24.05]What the fuck was that?
[47:24.97]That was a bomb.
[47:26.66]Probably almost out of arrows.
[47:30.41]Who's in trouble?
[47:31.01]It's the guy with the backpack.
[47:33.65]He's just running away as fast as possible.
[47:39.29]God damn it.
[47:41.07]I don't think you're going to kill that plane.
[47:45.31]Yes, we are.
[47:47.17]Okay.
[47:47.57]Well, I've got an Uzi, so... Good luck to you.
[47:52.67]Here, I got an eye.
[47:53.23]I got a better idea.
[47:54.08]Can you help me?
[47:59.82]Almost got him.
[48:01.88]I'm just lying dead.
[48:04.24]I got a good idea.
[48:05.98]How are you dead?
[48:06.80]He unloaded machine gun fire on me.
[48:08.76]I'm taking my shot!
[48:13.00]Uh-oh!
[48:13.62]Uh-oh!
[48:18.02]Thank you.
[48:19.26]You're welcome.
[48:22.03]How many like strafing runs would you do if you were in an airplane before like the FAA scrambles like jets?
[48:33.09]That had to hit him.
[48:34.25]Yes, it did.
[48:34.85]Okay, I got him.
[48:36.45]The plane is not... You destroyed the plane, kind of.
[48:39.58]But the guy inside is still alive somehow.
[48:44.68]There you are!
[48:53.00]I'd say he found us.
[48:57.81]Found you.
[48:58.97]I found you.
[48:59.67]Whoops.
[49:03.89]There you are!
[49:04.79]That was like a movie quality climactic death.
[49:10.80]That was the bad guy that just never gives up.
[49:13.76]That was like the second death the bad guy of the whole movie had.
[49:17.82]He died the first time but comes back at the end of the movie.
[49:21.68]He comes back at the very end of the movie.
[49:24.68]And they just find his charred skeleton.
[49:26.44]It's safe in here.
[49:29.70]Come picket and steal from these poor people.
[49:31.83]We got another mission in here.
[49:36.72]Okay, you want to do another mission in here?
[49:39.06]Hold on.
[49:39.88]I want to do... You can't take it, can you?
[49:43.88]You have to do everything, unfortunately.
[49:45.90]Because I have 14 perk points.
[49:48.21]Do you have the perk that lets you open chests?
[49:51.57]I do.
[49:52.37]And by open chests, I use your teeth cleaning device.
[49:56.97]You can open safes with the repair tool.
[49:59.69]Oh, really?
[50:01.73]With the squeeze flame, you can do that.
[50:05.58]If you use your squeeze flame, hold down Q and then press E. If you use your squeeze flame, you'll be fine.
[50:14.37]You can go up and save.
[50:17.95]How do you know that?
[50:20.89]Somebody told me.
[50:23.71]I'm going to cook his carrots for him.
[50:24.83]I'm going to be a help here.
[50:25.99]I'm going to be useful.
[50:28.59]You like know exactly which button to push too.
[50:31.03]You don't even have this tool.
[50:32.90]Yes, I do.
[50:33.62]I'm having my hand right now, yeah.
[50:36.84]Oh.
[50:38.08]Come on, man.
[50:38.52]Your burners are fucked up.
[50:39.36]All right, let me get those carrots.
[50:46.02]On my way.
[50:46.44]Let me get that onion, too.
[50:50.63]All right, let's do the mission.
[51:00.88]Uh, we got Clutch Nixon Stunts?
[51:03.26]Oh, wait, did he start a fire in here?
[51:06.24]He started a fire?
[51:07.14]How did he do that?
[51:11.44]Oh, no, you... Okay, I get it.
[51:12.76]I understand now.
[51:14.02]I get it now.
[51:15.08]I thought he just, like, fucked up the oven.
[51:17.18]Hey, watch this.
[51:18.42]Like, I'm dead!
[51:19.16]Come in, come in.
[51:19.93]Oh, you're... Wait, what?
[51:21.89]You burnt the shit out of me until I burned to death.
[51:23.89]Alright, come in here.
[51:30.13]Okay.
[51:32.43]Oh, I see what you did.
[51:34.43]Yeah, you used the repair tool.
[51:35.87]You could set people on fire.
[51:38.32]Now she... I can't revive her, though, because... There we go.
[51:43.64]Somebody help me!
[51:45.94]Our quest is running away.
[51:47.12]How far away is he going to go?
[51:48.60]He's getting away.
[51:49.58]Somebody help me!
[51:53.43]He didn't go very far.
[51:54.25]It's minor.
[51:56.41]It's minor.
[51:56.95]Ah!
[51:57.11]Ah!
[52:00.03]I'm sorry.
[52:01.10]I should start.
[52:01.58]All right, let's go.
[52:02.58]Let's do a mission.
[52:10.40]What?
[52:10.88]Oh, shit.
[52:12.28]I thought I had a grenade.
[52:13.53]No, I thought I had a knife.
[52:17.01]I thought I had a knife.
[52:17.73]Now he's behind the kitchen.
[52:19.29]I thought it was a knife.
[52:20.31]I thought it was a knife.
[52:20.91]He constantly moves like 13 feet back every time he gets hurt.
[52:23.93]Just talk to him.
[52:26.94]He's in conflict right now.
[52:28.80]Is he?
[52:29.30]Well, he won't be in a second.
[52:30.46]Now lift him up.
[52:32.07]We're going to break this encounter.
[52:34.61]We need to stop doing this shit.
[52:35.71]This is only funny because she came out here with an assault rifle.
[52:53.74]Stop!
[52:54.32]Let him talk.
[52:55.52]She can't run the corner with a gun.
[52:58.72]That's the only reason why that's funny.
[52:59.98]Oh, postponed?
[53:22.30]How far away can I get before he stops talking?
[53:23.98]Did you throw this rock?
[53:25.66]How did you throw that rock?
[53:30.26]Oh, you can actually throw rocks.
[53:32.26]It goes really far.
[53:34.91]That does go far.
[53:37.09]Can we try to kill somebody with rocks?
[53:39.25]I don't think that they take any damage, do they?
[53:41.15]Not at all?
[53:42.67]Let's go find another NPC.
[53:45.01]Let's find an actual bad guy.
[53:47.53]Reach Hyde's barn.
[53:49.07]That's just too conspicuous.
[53:51.17]I don't want to take that.
[53:52.85]We need something that's inconspicuous.
[53:55.19]Alright, I got just the thing.
[53:56.29]You know?
[53:59.53]Maybe I don't have enough money.
[54:00.55]Let's find out.
[54:02.51]But I got just the thing.
[54:07.25]They do go so far.
[54:09.81]Go play for a Major League Baseball team.
[54:12.53]Like, crow-hop and throw.
[54:13.98]You'll throw the guy out at home plate.
[54:21.05]Did I just hit her right in the head?
[54:23.11]No.
[54:29.63]Oh, you got like the funny, you have the funny mobile.
[54:31.53]Okay.
[54:33.95]I do.
[54:34.35]I have the funny mobile.
[54:35.66]This is the county fair.
[54:39.20]The thing that you can drive around that goes four miles per hour.
[54:42.18]You've got like a lever there on your side.
[54:44.16]I doubt it does anything.
[54:47.08]You know, let's do some drive-by skullcrackers.
[54:49.04]This is a perfect vehicle for drive-by.
[54:50.89]It really is.
[54:52.25]Let's just vandalize some shit.
[54:54.85]You know what I mean?
[54:55.83]Let's be fucking pranksters.
[54:59.71]Mailbox, baby!
[55:02.15]I missed.
[55:02.57]Fuck.
[55:02.81]Do it again.
[55:03.35]Is it too far away?
[55:05.04]It might have been a little... Let's just see.
[55:11.62]Dink.
[55:12.14]Screw you, Mr. Anderson.
[55:13.50]He didn't even knock it over.
[55:16.04]Mr. Anderson's a total turd.
[55:21.83]You ever been pranked like this before?
[55:26.90]You're just driving into things.
[55:28.84]Got it.
[55:29.32]It's kind of hard to aim, you know.
[55:32.08]Also, there's not that many signs.
[55:33.50]Here we go.
[55:34.26]Didn't even tip me in my newspaper route.
[55:38.62]Oh, that's not doing anything.
[55:40.63]Here we go.
[55:41.05]Here we go.
[55:41.57]This guy right here.
[55:42.27]These guys have a machine gun.
[55:43.45]It's all right, though.
[55:44.81]Let's prank these guys.
[55:47.95]Hold on.
[55:50.45]Yeah, get it so they can be on my side, and we'll make sure they get pranked good.
[55:55.24]Happy Halloween, losers!
[55:59.80]It's too far away.
[56:13.50]Okay, got it.
[56:15.22]It works, it works.
[56:16.10]You gotta be pretty close though.
[56:22.24]This one's gonna be fast.
[56:25.34]It's too fast.
[56:26.10]He also has a machine gun, so it probably wouldn't kill him.
[56:29.06]We gotta get a good prank on somebody.
[56:30.56]Like a good one, going like 100 miles per hour.
[56:33.95]Ow.
[56:34.13]We're both getting killed from like 400 feet away.
[56:37.03]Oh, god damn it.
[56:38.63]Okay, I gotta hold on.
[56:39.31]I gotta lean in.
[56:40.37]I gotta take out my gun.
[56:44.59]I'll take care of this guy first.
[56:48.58]He's not even chasing us anymore.
[56:49.74]All right.
[56:51.52]Okay, here we go.
[56:52.10]Let me get my... Frank a cow.
[57:00.41]What is exploding?
[57:01.79]No, don't throw it.
[57:02.93]I don't want to throw this.
[57:08.13]I'm just queuing up for a throw.
[57:09.56]These are the guys.
[57:10.32]What are these guys?
[57:13.14]These are the quest guys.
[57:14.26]They're shooting something, though.
[57:18.78]There's something up there that we should know about?
[57:20.56]Apparently.
[57:22.21]What is it?
[57:22.53]A helicopter?
[57:31.64]We got some birds of prey in the sky.
[57:34.60]I don't want to throw my cool blue shovel.
[57:35.68]If you can... Okay, here's your new... This is the new shovel challenge.
[57:38.56]New shovel challenge?
[57:40.14]Uh, find an eagle.
[57:41.48]Yeah.
[57:41.98]When it comes down to swoop you, you shovel it before it can swoop you.
[57:45.39]So you're talking about prank the eagle while he tries to kill me.
[57:48.73]Yeah.
[57:48.97]Okay.
[57:52.47]Aren't these... Aren't these birds?
[57:55.41]These aren't the eagles.
[57:56.35]He looks like he's kind of angry with me.
[58:02.69]Uh...
[58:04.59]Well, that works too.
[58:06.29]Here we go.
[58:07.83]I don't think they're going to attack us because they don't turn red when you binocular them.
[58:13.10]I'm going for an eagle tag here.
[58:16.08]You could throw it.
[58:16.96]Yeah, you could try throwing it.
[58:20.36]That was actually pretty close.
[58:21.54]I'm not going to lie.
[58:24.88]Why do I have two of these?
[58:26.38]How many shovels do I have?
[58:28.18]You get like three of each, I think, or something.
[58:31.56]But I got to pick yours up.
[58:32.62]I think he's shooting at the eagles.
[58:39.32]Who gave us this quest?
[58:40.60]Why do we care about what we're doing right now?
[58:43.52]Do we?
[58:44.28]Like, no.
[58:44.58]I mean, we need to do the mission.
[58:45.62]I just lost both my shovels.
[58:48.54]Shovels are both gone.
[58:50.68]Now I only have the prank bat.
[58:55.59]There it is.
[58:56.31]It just hit the ground.
[58:57.05]Are you kidding me?
[58:58.01]Wow.
[59:03.16]All right, get me.
[59:04.48]That was at least a 30-foot shot.
[59:09.68]And you stole them.
[59:10.90]I don't get to use them again.
[59:12.02]Well, they were mine to begin with.
[59:13.93]That's true.
[59:14.53]That is true.
[59:15.17]You have one.
[59:15.83]You stole one from me.
[59:21.63]All right, let's just talk to him.
[59:22.87]Let's get this over with.
[59:23.69]We can prank that somebody.
[59:24.51]He's in conflict, and it's not our fault for once.
[59:29.20]Oh, no.
[59:29.46]So we do have to kill the bird.
[59:30.42]We are going to have to kill the bird, yeah.
[59:32.48]He's going to give us the sniper, though.
[59:34.23]Shoot down the vultures.
[59:36.09]Wait, did you get it?
[59:37.17]No.
[59:37.27]I just got SMG ammo.
[59:56.22]Wait.
[59:57.46]I think it's just on the ground here.
[59:58.70]One of these vultures has died here.
[60:00.08]Yeah.
[60:00.78]We win.
[60:02.02]Congratulations.
[60:06.78]Hee haw, hee haw.
[60:13.26]Thank God All right, so who wants to be I'm gonna want me to be the hotdog vendor and you can be the guy that drives the truck Yeah, okay.

[60:43.74]I'm gonna take orders.
[60:45.33]Did you already kill the birds that we were supposed to kill?
[60:47.43]Yeah, they were already dead.
[60:48.53]Oh, this is actually a trailer.
[60:50.51]Yeah.
[60:52.01]Oh.
[60:52.31]This is our food truck, man.
[60:56.26]Our food truck can be two long wieners, you know what I mean?
[60:58.98]You know, because there are two of us, and that's what we sell?
[61:04.80]Don't you do it!
[61:05.52]Don't do it!
[61:06.04]You deserved it.
[61:09.05]I was ironically saying that.
[61:12.20]You deserved it for that joke.
[61:13.14]No, I didn't.
[61:13.64]That wasn't a joke.
[61:14.30]That wasn't me pretending to make a joke, ironically making a pretend joke.
[61:17.46]Now get back in that car and let's sell some fucking wieners.
[61:25.97]I don't... First of all, there's like 90s alt-rock on the radio.
[61:30.11]Second of all, where...
[61:33.05]You have to bring some customers to me.
[61:36.47]I will bring you so many customers.
[61:39.25]It's $2.99 for a sausage.
[61:40.77]$4.99 for a steak sandwich.
[61:45.92]Mustard's extra.
[61:46.84]Ketchup's extra.
[61:48.74]Mayo's extra.
[61:50.04]We're one of those companies.
[61:54.74]There's actual weight on the trailer.
[61:56.53]And all the dogs are fucking expired.
[62:00.18]Deal with it, you piece of shit.
[62:05.98]Do you see any customers?
[62:08.02]Nah.
[62:12.71]Get fucking pranked.
[62:19.71]How did you drive directly into that thing?
[62:24.07]All right, costume up.
[62:26.15]You'll know eventually.
[62:28.53]Take us to the county fair.
[62:32.64]I'm trying to like knock you off by getting something to go right down the side.
[62:36.26]So he's one of these kinds of YouTubers.
[62:40.58]Yes.
[62:46.68]Alright, gotta hit like a jump or something at least.
[62:48.70]You're gonna get me killed, man.
[62:56.67]Oh, well there it goes.
[62:57.63]Bye.
[62:58.37]I'm off.
[63:00.13]How are we leaving the mission zone?
[63:04.24]Okay, I'm good.
[63:05.16]You good?
[63:09.02]Is this the next Mad Max?
[63:11.46]No, I haven't noticed the Testicle Festival.
[63:15.02]It's an interesting name.
[63:15.86]Yes, we are going to the Testy Festy.
[63:18.30]Okay, wait, we have to just deliver this.
[63:20.38]What a terrible, not even funny thing we didn't do.
[63:26.79]Why is she out there with a gun?
[63:27.95]Because you have to deliver that to her.
[63:32.96]I'm like jackknifing the trailer.
[63:36.22]Oh, you just scared the hell out of her.
[63:44.49]What a not funny thing we just had to do.
[63:46.83]Yeah.
[63:49.61]We had an opportunity to do like a funny I get customers roleplay joke.
[63:53.79]That could have been a really funny YouTube clip, you know what I'm saying?
[63:58.19]A guy would have come up there and I'd be like, sir, sir, excuse me.
[64:01.64]There's no need to yell.
[64:02.78]And I'd be pretending to give him hot dogs.
[64:05.34]And then I would eventually throw the bat in his face as pretend payment.
[64:09.40]You know, like, I keep the change, you fucking asshole.
[64:11.82]And I'd throw the bat in his face.
[64:13.26]And then we could complete the joke.
[64:19.36]What?
[64:20.19]You're throwing shit all over the ground.
[64:21.29]All right, let's go talk to somebody.
[64:26.09]You've been marked.
[64:27.15]You've been marked with... Are we taking the taxi?
[64:31.51]Yes.
[64:32.41]Okay.
[64:32.95]Let's go in the taxi then.
[64:38.13]So now... What did that do?
[64:41.26]I think we just... I think forever now, we're just going to have the rivals attacking us.
[64:46.90]Sideways.
[64:48.38]Yeah, you... Which way are you facing in your game?
[64:50.72]I'm driving straight ahead.
[64:52.92]Oh, now you are.
[64:54.69]You were driving towards the barn.
[64:56.87]I mean, we're here.
[64:57.41]Let's get this thing, too.
[64:58.49]There's another one in here.
[65:02.70]Running without any questions asked.
[65:04.22]These are not story missions, by the way.
[65:06.04]Yeah, but he's like the chef, so we get... Who is this?
[65:10.88]This guy's the side quest chef giver that told us to go get the... That guy looked too much like me.
[65:16.54]He had to go.
[65:17.22]Oh, no.
[65:17.54]You've done something irreparable at this point.
[65:20.38]I'm sorry.
[65:20.74]That guy looked way too much like me.
[65:21.96]I didn't like it.
[65:22.40]I was uncomfortable with it.
[65:27.13]She was prepared to kill you and then she decided against it Like I had the same haircut as me sorry guys
[65:42.50]I don't know how that got in there.
[65:44.10]I threw it up at the roof.
[65:45.98]It somehow came through the wall and then landed on top next to the carrots.
[65:49.71]No, just don't scare the guy cutting carrots by putting a bomb on his cutting board.
[65:57.29]What's funny to me is he gets scared to the same location.
[65:59.65]He's got like a progression of scaredom.
[66:01.87]I saw that.
[66:03.45]You want to do this guy's quest?
[66:04.88]Yes.
[66:05.12]Okay.
[66:05.26]Just let you choose this.
[66:06.68]Okay.
[66:12.68]Are you talking about balls at this point?
[66:14.56]I don't know.
[66:15.30]Yes, they are.
[66:17.12]We need something new.
[66:20.39]Something exciting.
[66:22.19]What if you read this as your script?
[66:23.85]It would be fun.
[66:24.33]Shredded, roasted, and blue.
[66:25.45]What do you say like that?
[66:36.74]Blue balls, you know?
[66:37.64]It was a blue balls joke.
[66:41.91]Why is this guy talking in weird innuendos?
[66:47.81]Just tell us what you want me to do.
[66:49.79]Tell us what you'd like us to do.
[66:50.85]Okay.
[66:53.23]He wants us to go to a farm where they farm balls.
[66:57.36]Okay.
[66:58.64]The ball farm.
[67:00.30]So, uh, we got a vehicle that we can take.
[67:05.65]Technically, yes, we do.
[67:07.23]We have this one.
[67:08.83]We could also spawn one.
[67:10.89]Somebody said you look like Matt Damon with a goatee.
[67:14.19]Me?
[67:14.61]Yes.
[67:15.47]That's high praise.
[67:18.54]Who wouldn't want to look like Matt Damon?
[67:20.50]Then I could be in all sorts of great movies, like Great Wall.
[67:26.00]That's your go-to for a great Matt Damon movie?
[67:30.40]Yeah, I could be in the zoo movie.
[67:33.94]All right, get on here.
[67:35.06]Matt Damon in the zoo?
[67:42.11]I could cameo.
[67:43.51]Wait, are we taking that?
[67:46.19]We can both drive.
[67:46.93]All right, you take that.
[67:47.73]I'll take this.
[67:48.41]I'm going to follow you.
[67:49.27]You get there.
[67:51.68]Oh.
[67:52.54]Well, let me make a... I got to set my Google Maps.
[67:54.84]I'm surprised you weren't doing side quests.
[68:00.24]I mean, they're right here.
[68:01.64]It's free money.
[68:04.21]Also, are you getting the thing where sometimes it tries to make you drive on the right side of the road?
[68:09.47]No.
[68:10.99]I don't think so.
[68:11.96]We have to go to the yes sign as well.
[68:15.90]Soon.
[68:19.76]I mean, I can see that on my screen.
[68:22.06]I know you don't think I can see that, but I can.
[68:24.85]I know.
[68:33.94]It's actually pretty cool.
[68:35.60]You got a lot of people up there.
[68:37.34]I do, yeah.
[68:38.24]I tried burning them.
[68:39.79]It seemed effective.
[68:41.23]Oh, god damn it.
[68:41.97]And now I have to deal with this?
[68:46.49]I think I'm having trouble here.
[68:47.87]I'm about to go out.
[68:49.67]They've hit me with bliss bullets.
[68:51.25]Oh, no.
[68:52.19]Is that what's happening?
[68:53.00]Why I'm like on drugs right now?
[68:54.94]Yeah.
[68:56.40]Well, I am now under the under the smoke and mirrors.
[69:01.22]Didn't they already catch us once or is this a different catch em scene?
[69:04.04]This might be a different catch em scene.
[69:06.52]What happened?
[69:07.06]How do we even get away the last time?
[69:14.59]Well, you wanted to do story mission.
[69:17.45]This is this is definitely that.
[69:20.91]Take them to John.
[69:21.99]He's ready to hear their confession.
[69:26.67]Under the influence of the Lord.
[69:28.15]And?
[69:49.10]Tofu brick.
[69:51.84]He's gonna drain that for a little while before he can use it.
[69:54.84]I don't even eat tofu.
[70:11.31]My parents were the first ones to teach me about the power of yes.
[70:20.97]One night they took me into the kitchen and they threw me on the ground.
[70:27.44]I experienced pain after pain after pain.
[70:32.02]He sounds like someone that I recognize.
[70:37.28]And when I didn't think I could take anymore.
[70:42.05]I did.
[70:42.37]Uh oh.
[70:44.85]Something broke.
[70:47.94]This is what it feels like to be on the other side of torture, remember?
[70:51.99]Mhm.
[70:52.39]This is a way out revenge.
[70:53.47]No, but that's what the tattoo guy... He's gonna tattoo yes on my forehead.
[70:57.63]He's gonna tattoo your eyeballs.
[70:59.83]No.
[71:02.22]Yes is gonna get tattooed on our hand or something.
[71:08.16]But I hope we get to see it for the rest of the game.
[71:10.40]Yeah.
[71:11.60]Like, I get to look over at you, and any time I ask you a question, you just say yes.
[71:14.58]Always taking it.
[71:34.14]Is he doing it, or is he giving us a sponge bath?
[71:36.21]No, he's cleaning the area.
[71:37.35]You don't get tattooed with a sponge.
[71:38.91]Yeah, but we're, like, moving very violently, is all I'm saying.
[71:41.57]Like, I'm, like, bouncing around.
[71:42.77]No, he's wiping alcohol on our face.
[71:44.85]We're gonna get a face tattoo.
[71:46.09]That was my face?
[71:47.09]Where am I looking at him from?
[71:48.47]That was my chest.
[71:50.09]He opened the shirt.
[71:51.33]That was probably, like, he's probably doing it to your mouth.
[71:53.37]He wanted us to look like him, where he has, like, four buttons undone.
[71:58.45]...to cut it out like a cancer and display it for all to see.
[72:07.56]He probably shaved his body.
[72:08.80]His whole body.
[72:11.78]We've seen a lot of this guy.
[72:13.18]It's because we're in his area.
[72:16.78]We're like in his valley.
[72:19.07]So if we were doing enough chaos in the other sections...
[72:36.14]He wears really nice designer glasses for being such a strange person.
[72:39.80]That vest, too, is very silky.
[72:41.79]Who wants to go first?
[72:43.95]Oh, me!
[72:44.37]Me!
[72:44.75]Me!
[72:46.47]Please!
[72:46.81]Me!
[72:47.29]I just said yes immediately.
[72:48.37]Yes!
[72:48.57]Yes!
[72:51.87]His whole shtick is like, say yes, you know?
[72:54.11]So I just said yes as soon as possible.
[72:57.38]I promise.
[73:00.62]Now, before we begin...
[73:02.78]He's like, oh yeah, that's exactly what I hoped you would say.
[73:06.67]No, wait a minute.
[73:07.37]It was supposed to be me first.
[73:10.95]Unlockable vehicle.
[73:17.76]Chair.
[73:18.18]I am not here to take your life.
[73:22.14]I'm here to give it to you.
[73:29.58]Wouldn't that kill you?
[73:34.26]I'm not going to kill you.
[73:34.90]I'm just going to open you up and kill you.
[73:38.96]He's going to keep us alive, scientifically.
[73:44.83]No!
[73:46.01]Who said no?
[73:46.65]I don't know.
[73:47.17]Oh, her.
[73:49.69]You have to say yes.
[73:51.71]I didn't hear that, but...
[73:55.66]Oh wait, are you are you watching me play?
[73:58.90]Are you playing?
[73:59.60]Are you in a different room?
[74:00.52]I'm watching you I'm watching you play right now All right, then you take me away am I supposed to be that girl Are you playing when you hit W what happens nothing?
[74:12.96]I'm watching your point of view Like if I look up do you look up?
[74:16.79]Yes, I can see I can see the ceiling I'm watching you play a VR game.
[74:20.75]Let's see.
[74:20.99]Oh
[74:23.44]So you're looking at me turn, like, left to right?
[74:25.55]Oh, yeah, this is just your perspective.
[74:27.43]Oh.
[74:28.01]What happens if I go too slow?
[74:29.55]Like, I can scoot backward.
[74:33.31]Will he come back and, like, murder me?
[74:35.21]I don't know.
[74:35.79]Wait 15 minutes to see the end of Far Cry 5.
[74:37.63]I mean, we're already past that point.
[74:41.21]Yeah, right now what's happening is I'm pulling through OBS your game feed as well and streaming it.
[74:47.94]Yeah, well, I'm about to scoot down the stairs.
[74:52.47]I'm your streaming PC right now.
[74:54.91]Well, how did my hands come unbound through that though?
[74:57.99]Because shoddy rope?
[74:59.17]Alright, well come on.
[75:05.23]Let's get... I'm watching a stream here.
[75:07.40]Excuse me.
[75:09.64]You back?
[75:10.48]I just came out of you.
[75:11.82]You birthed me.
[75:15.18]So this is what we like multiple personality disorder here.
[75:17.78]Like I just, now I'm you.
[75:19.06]Yeah.
[75:19.40]Like I see you, you see me, but we're both the same person.
[75:21.95]We already made the Tyler Durden joke like last time.
[75:24.47]We can't do that again.
[75:25.83]Did we?
[75:26.93]When we played, um, we played a way out.
[75:30.05]We made like the multiple personality Tyler Durden thing already.
[75:34.11]Yeah.
[75:34.51]Well, it is a classic of our time.
[75:36.21]That's a classic reference.
[75:37.53]And if you don't like it,
[75:39.59]There's a parachute option there.
[75:40.89]Oh, that would've been fun.
[75:43.31]Okay, hold on.
[75:45.33]Alright, don't get us killed.
[75:48.58]I won't get us killed.
[75:50.56]We don't have any guns or weapons.
[75:52.66]How did you get... Oh.
[75:54.76]Okay, well.
[76:00.52]Anything else he has here?
[76:01.44]Uh, I got a baseball bat.
[76:04.80]Got a person right there.
[76:06.38]Person right there.
[76:06.78]They're gonna see you.
[76:08.94]Did he?
[76:15.46]That's such bullshit.
[76:17.44]Are you okay back there?
[76:18.72]I'm fine.
[76:19.00]I'm alright.
[76:19.37]I'm alright.
[76:20.21]Just bounced off.
[76:21.03]My bad.
[76:22.25]Didn't realize there was a guy.
[76:23.23]I just gave you ammo.
[76:26.35]Thanks.
[76:28.11]I didn't mean to.
[76:28.95]Alright, we gotta take this slow.
[76:34.03]Let's take it slow.
[76:34.89]This is definitely one of those take it slow missions.
[76:39.01]That was awesome.
[76:39.73]Did you just get two people with that?
[76:41.55]No, I killed them with a throwing knife.
[76:44.12]Ooh, I have a grenade.
[76:45.68]In the head.
[76:47.32]Should I use my grenade at some point here?
[76:48.74]Okay, we got more than four people in a room that are getting grenade rummed.
[76:52.10]I'm going to throw it in there.
[76:52.88]You know what I'm saying?
[76:54.38]Okay.
[76:56.38]Make sure you cook it first.
[76:58.21]We're going the right way.
[76:59.77]I think so.
[77:04.59]I'm following the, like, prompts.
[77:06.15]What are you laughing at?
[77:07.21]Man, you just punched it.
[77:08.03]That was the wrong button.
[77:10.59]It's either the E or F, and they're both relevant.
[77:12.93]Oh, E?
[77:15.41]No, RE.
[77:17.40]Okay, we're gonna do a double throw takedown here.
[77:19.18]I'm gonna get the guy on the right, you get the guy on the left.
[77:21.50]You ready?
[77:22.46]I'm ready.
[77:23.10]One, two, three.
[77:26.12]Mine got stuck.
[77:28.47]Mine got stuffed by the little grate that I was in.
[77:31.93]The same thing just happened to me.
[77:33.53]Here, look, I was sitting right here.
[77:34.83]Oh, no.
[77:36.01]Ah, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[77:38.50]Holy shit, what?
[77:41.24]This did not go well.
[77:42.02]They all came from every angle.
[77:43.26]There's people... They did.
[77:45.02]This is not going... Oh, my God.
[77:47.10]Yeah, I made a little extra noise than I was supposed to.
[77:52.69]Why are you making so much noise?
[77:58.02]Because I threw the bat and it hit something that was right next to me.
[78:03.10]Same thing happened to me.
[78:03.76]You need to get a good, clear field of view.
[78:07.57]Okay.
[78:08.31]We just do it again.
[78:10.55]I mean, are you in favor of sprint punching and just sprint meleeing?
[78:15.73]I mean, they sent like seven guys, didn't they?
[78:19.11]Wait, wait, wait.
[78:20.57]I need to get a weapon.
[78:22.65]Yeah, that's why we got to go back down here again.
[78:25.69]Wait, where are you going?
[78:27.63]I don't know.
[78:29.05]They can hear you running around, though.
[78:31.69]How did you get over there?
[78:33.13]Am I going backwards?
[78:33.93]No.
[78:34.38]Look, come over here.
[78:35.70]I know, I'm coming.
[78:36.16]There you go.
[78:37.06]They definitely heard you run.
[78:38.86]They'll investigate over there.
[78:42.46]All right.
[78:43.46]All those in favor of sprint punching, sprint meleeing through the whole thing, say aye.
[78:48.00]Through the whole thing?
[78:48.86]Just sprinting from here on out and holding down left click and just running by and hitting people.
[78:53.66]With fists or with a bat?
[78:54.74]With a bat.
[78:55.10]Just melee.
[78:58.04]Okay.
[78:58.52]All those in favor, say aye.
[78:59.90]Are you allowed to... It's always funny every fucking time.
[79:06.12]It's funny every time.
[79:08.58]Okay.
[79:08.84]Are you ready?
[79:10.16]I'm in favor of right click throwing at people.
[79:13.00]I like that better than left click.
[79:15.12]I like right click more.
[79:16.20]Well, however you want to do it.
[79:19.31]You're gonna lose all your stuff, though.
[79:20.61]I mean, we don't have any stuff.
[79:25.43]Yeah, but you're gonna throw your melee weapon.
[79:26.95]It's gonna be gone.
[79:27.37]I got throwing knives.
[79:27.97]All right, we ready?
[79:30.06]Okay, you ready?
[79:31.38]I'm ready.
[79:31.84]Three, two, one, action.
[79:42.81]I mean, like, that's definitely... Right click is definitely preferable to left click.
[79:48.60]It's opening, man.
[79:49.86]Oh, shit.
[79:55.78]Wait, did you just hit me?
[79:58.08]I hit you, it bounced off of you, and killed the guy.
[80:00.72]Why do I have... I have a gun.
[80:03.25]Oh, my God.
[80:03.91]Will you stop doing... Stop it.
[80:05.81]You just killed me.
[80:08.89]Why did you do that?
[80:10.50]Because it just hits you.
[80:12.20]It's got a big hitbox, man.
[80:13.88]Oh my god.
[80:15.28]It has a big hitbox, okay?
[80:19.44]Like, it's not even aiming at you, but it spins.
[80:22.42]No more throwing.
[80:23.54]No more throwing.
[80:24.30]Just left-click.
[80:28.36]You hit me both times.
[80:30.00]How about only the person at the front can throw?
[80:33.02]If you're in the front, you can throw.
[80:33.96]If you're in the front, you're allowed to throw.
[80:35.64]I like that idea.
[80:36.72]If not, then you gotta all left-click it out.
[80:43.37]I'm getting, like, stuck.
[80:45.65]What?
[80:47.01]What'd you do?
[80:47.59]Why is he here?
[80:48.49]He's just here.
[80:50.17]Because he probably heard you run around.
[80:52.07]He heard you, like, sprinting.
[80:53.49]Take the bat.
[80:54.79]Okay.
[80:55.66]Three, two, one, action.
[81:08.74]Going so far, so good, I think.
[81:10.20]So far, so good.
[81:11.50]Just take as much as you can.
[81:14.52]I should have taken more.
[81:18.10]They definitely hear us somehow through this seal door.
[81:20.06]Don't even matter.
[81:20.72]Just keep the plan.
[81:28.58]I'm down.
[81:34.95]I did the thing that you did last time.
[81:36.45]You did the thing, yeah.
[81:37.83]I'll get you.
[81:39.73]There's a lot of people coming, man.
[81:41.21]I don't think you're going to get me.
[81:43.45]I'd rather just watch.
[81:48.76]That guy's got a gun.
[81:51.52]You're definitely not going to get me.
[81:53.08]I'm just going to spectate you.
[81:55.90]He's just going to come in here.
[82:00.64]They don't know where you are.
[82:01.62]Now they know.
[82:07.75]There's more.
[82:08.23]I'm going to spawn in five seconds, actually.
[82:13.17]If you can stay alive for two more seconds.
[82:14.83]There was a gun!
[82:21.56]No guns.
[82:22.46]Didn't we say no guns?
[82:23.24]I don't have a gun.
[82:25.34]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[82:26.38]What if they have guns?
[82:27.14]Is that... Wait.
[82:28.64]I need a... Give me a melee weapon.
[82:32.14]I don't have anything.
[82:35.03]Easy.
[82:36.07]That's the only way for me to drop it.
[82:51.78]Good.
[82:52.50]Keep going.
[82:54.81]The people behind us.
[82:55.61]Are they?
[83:00.67]Three.
[83:00.99]Wait for it.
[83:01.97]Move over to the left.
[83:05.43]You want to double tap this guy when he shows up?
[83:08.15]I don't know if they will.
[83:09.13]They're just yelling.
[83:09.95]Yeah, they are just screaming.
[83:13.32]I think we've evaded them somehow.
[83:15.30]Yeah, I think we're good.
[83:18.00]Yeah, we're good.
[83:19.06]Long distance?
[83:20.38]Is he down there?
[83:21.62]Oh.
[83:25.76]I don't have anything left to throw.
[83:26.96]Okay.
[83:34.39]Let's go.
[83:35.13]What is that, like, rabid animal squealing as she dies?
[83:39.29]Oh, watch it.
[83:44.35]Good.
[83:45.97]This is the best weapon in the game.
[83:47.27]We win.
[83:49.68]Oh wait, we found a... Why did we show her face in the window?
[83:59.46]He's probably going to kill her now.
[84:01.61]I really wish he would make a can I help you joke.
[84:03.95]Like a drive-thru or something.
[84:10.09]Would you like to try our new special?
[84:12.64]Hey, thanks for choosing the cult.
[84:14.16]Can I get you some fries?
[84:15.26]Or want to try our new $1 Frosties?
[84:17.10]And he, like, starts laughing.
[84:18.56]Oh, that would be perfect.
[84:25.76]Just poke your fingers through and grab him with your fingers and pull him into the grate and bite his nose off.
[84:30.13]Yeah, just like spider your fingers in there and like grab him, scratch his face and shit.
[84:35.37]Your fingers would become like grated cheese.
[84:37.73]No, they wouldn't.
[84:38.51]You would just stick him in there and just start scraping his face as hard as you could.
[84:41.94]You'd do some damage.
[84:43.00]Wouldn't it be faster to like just pick her up instead of rolling her around or put her in a wheelchair?
[84:48.72]I think we have a minute to get out of here, by the way.
[84:50.40]I think we have to leave.
[84:51.22]There are drugs.
[84:54.64]Are you hurting me?
[84:55.38]You're hurting me.
[84:55.94]No, I'm not.
[84:56.92]We're dying from the drugs.
[84:59.32]Using a med kit.
[85:01.24]Oh, shit.
[85:01.76]Yeah.
[85:02.50]That's a good idea.
[85:03.08]There's a shock in here.
[85:04.94]No guns.
[85:05.70]No guns?
[85:06.68]Fine.
[85:09.21]We came this far.
[85:12.35]To sprint and left click, right click is all we're going to do.
[85:15.53]Okay.
[85:18.55]This is high.
[85:19.25]Okay, they are immune to the throw.
[85:27.46]I died.
[85:27.80]I tried to kick the guy for like 50 feet away.
[85:32.93]You're fine.
[85:33.49]Everything's fine.
[85:34.09]Let's go.
[85:35.71]I don't... Come on!
[85:49.18]What?!
[85:50.38]Oh my fucking god, give me a break!
[85:53.28]How did you make it all the way out there?
[85:56.14]There are like five people out here.
[85:57.48]There are like four dogs!
[86:01.92]I tried to cartoon shoot her in the face over and over again.
[86:06.21]Are we dead?
[86:07.39]We're dead, yeah.
[86:11.87]That courtyard has like at least seven enemies.
[86:14.81]Yeah, we can't just sprint out there.
[86:19.17]I do have a grenade and I'm gonna use it, so...
[86:22.44]Yeah, that's like the Chekhov's gun of this encounter.
[86:25.24]You've been talking about the grenade for like... How do I not have it anymore?
[86:27.70]Okay, I got it.
[86:28.40]I'm ready.
[86:30.66]You know what to do.
[86:35.48]Oh, fucking God.
[86:36.80]Stop with the goddamn kicking.
[86:39.40]I just want a takedown, not put my shoe in the air.
[86:42.40]I'm down.
[86:46.74]Good job.
[86:49.34]I'm fucking rocket!
[86:51.10]I gotcha.
[86:51.50]Yeah, but you can only take down someone if they don't know you're there.
[86:55.00]No, that's not true.
[86:56.80]Alright, are we doing guns now, right?
[86:59.06]Yes, we need to get out of this.
[87:00.66]Okay, I got guns.
[87:01.30]We have 55 seconds.
[87:04.97]I'm going for a dynamite stick out here.
[87:07.19]Grab the pitchfork.
[87:08.11]I don't have anything.
[87:08.81]You have to fight these people.
[87:11.57]Thank you.
[87:13.11]Med kit.
[87:16.91]Okay, we're almost making it.
[87:21.40]Here comes dynamite.
[87:22.98]Open the door.
[87:25.90]Perfect.
[87:29.88]Kill him.
[87:35.46]Oh my god.
[87:37.18]I got a patch up.
[87:40.25]Oh my god, shit.
[87:41.03]I'm being chased.
[87:41.71]I don't even know where I am.
[87:44.11]I don't know what's going on.
[87:45.55]My brain can't do it.
[87:46.25]I think we killed most of them.
[87:47.97]Okay, we're fine.
[87:49.15]I'm out of ammo.
[87:51.89]There's one more guy over here.
[87:54.59]Nice.
[87:57.33]I have three bullets.
[87:58.63]Okay, let's get out.
[88:03.70]Oh, shit.
[88:04.46]That didn't even kill him.
[88:08.04]Oh, my God.
[88:09.06]Hang on.
[88:10.20]Oh, my God.
[88:10.58]Oh, my God.
[88:10.84]Oh, my God.
[88:11.06]Oh, my God.
[88:12.19]Oh, my God.
[88:15.55]All right.
[88:16.83]Escape.
[88:19.95]Escape.
[88:21.65]Go.
[88:21.95]I don't know how to do it.
[88:23.87]Drive.
[88:24.27]Oh, I thought this was a trick.
[88:27.50]Oh my god.
[88:30.94]No.
[88:34.13]Why is it on fire?
[88:45.38]Why was the car on fire?
[88:47.42]Did you drive straight into the wall?
[88:51.68]Did you just hold W and drive straight into the wall?
[88:55.28]I bumped into the wall, so all of a sudden the car's on fire.
[88:58.27]There was a helicopter with guns behind us.
[89:00.21]Oh my god, alright, no fucking, no more.
[89:02.51]Done.
[89:03.75]Pick up the shit, just get us out of here.
[89:06.69]Look, I'm doing my best.
[89:07.93]Just do your absolute best, try as hard as you can now.
[89:12.64]Give me that weapon.
[89:17.94]The power of yes.
[89:20.18]It's time to shoot somebody with the power of yes.
[89:22.35]Have you not had a gun the whole time?
[89:24.11]No, I haven't had a gun this whole time.
[89:25.47]All right.
[89:34.01]I'm going to use a med kit before going outside.
[89:35.99]Time to try hard.
[89:41.03]Behind us, behind us, somehow.
[89:42.85]No, we're just getting hit from... Oh, yeah, you're right.
[89:44.35]There's a person behind us.
[89:45.39]I'll take care of this person.
[89:51.72]I need to get out of here.
[89:52.34]I need some air.
[89:56.88]Oh my god!
[90:00.83]Why is there so many people?
[90:01.89]I don't know, but I'm just piping them all.
[90:06.83]What the fuck?
[90:08.63]I just piped like eight people.
[90:10.72]I can't even.
[90:11.86]That was so stupid.
[90:12.92]My brain hurt.
[90:13.46]I don't have any bullets in the gun.
[90:15.66]Oh no.
[90:20.69]I gotta do this.
[90:21.91]What?
[90:22.15]I'm dead.
[90:30.90]I can't do it, man.
[90:32.14]When the dog does something like that.
[90:34.16]When the dog gets flash-photographied in three or four different pictures.
[90:38.45]I'm sorry.
[90:40.47]I just got like five different photos of that dog.
[90:43.21]Okay, let's go.
[90:54.23]Why are you still down there?
[90:55.77]Hey, sorry, sorry, sorry.
[90:58.38]Alright, pick up the gun.
[91:00.42]Oh my god, my head is killing me.
[91:02.10]I didn't hit him once.
[91:08.08]I can't even concentrate.
[91:09.08]I really can't.
[91:11.68]Okay, do you have a pistol?
[91:12.85]I got a pistol.
[91:13.43]I'm ready.
[91:13.69]Alright, we're going to stay together.
[91:14.79]This is going to be...
[91:16.39]The normal mode victory.
[91:17.73]This isn't even on hard mode.
[91:19.03]No, no, no.
[91:19.69]We're just running into too many fucking dumb things.
[91:23.09]When I start laughing, man, I can't... It's not gonna happen.
[91:25.67]I can't even play the game if I'm not gonna laugh.
[91:27.19]How you doing?
[91:28.57]How you doing on health?
[91:30.19]Man, just picked up a backup gun.
[91:31.80]Picked up a sidearm.
[91:32.62]I got a grenade.
[91:33.34]I'm gonna throw it out there.
[91:34.68]Watch out.
[91:35.02]Okay, got him.
[91:43.34]Alright, watch out, watch out.
[91:44.24]Somebody's here.
[91:45.00]You did shoot me in the back.
[91:46.58]Okay, I'm gonna die.
[91:48.40]Just keep me alive.
[91:49.74]So I can resurrect some health.
[91:52.68]Are we good?
[91:56.68]I'm going on top of the roof.
[91:58.86]You're going on the roof?
[92:00.00]Yeah, I'm going on the roof.
[92:00.76]Yeah, there's a shotgun by the chair.
[92:01.50]I just, I didn't get it.
[92:02.40]I panicked.
[92:02.94]Should I paint somebody?
[92:12.75]We just need to get in the truck and go.
[92:13.75]They're just gonna keep... We gotta get out of here.
[92:19.95]Yeah, just get in the truck.
[92:21.13]You drive.
[92:21.57]Go.
[92:23.09]Okay, everything's fine.
[92:28.54]We did it.
[92:29.84]Well... Congratulations.
[92:31.44]Not yet.
[92:32.82]Well, almost.
[92:33.40]I don't even know who's shooting us.
[92:37.38]There's a helicopter in the sky.
[92:41.63]Is there?
[92:41.89]We're fine.
[92:45.75]Where the hell are we?
[92:48.85]There's like a... What have you done?
[92:50.91]I can't drive.
[92:51.72]No, don't say that.
[92:53.66]No, like literally, it wouldn't let me drive because this is in the way.
[92:57.64]We're supposed to have a car here.
[92:58.82]Hang on, hang on.
[92:59.86]Get the thing.
[93:01.68]What thing?
[93:02.08]Oh, the weed?
[93:03.00]Yeah, the repair.
[93:03.46]All right, we're like getting drugged right now.
[93:08.87]We gotta go.
[93:12.92]Oh, God.
[93:13.58]I got it.
[93:14.90]I got it.
[93:15.24]I got it.
[93:15.56]I got it.
[93:16.48]I'm already in this driver's seat.
[93:18.09]You're not in the driver's seat.
[93:21.75]Wait, what?
[93:22.81]I thought I was going to the driver's seat.
[93:26.47]You're in the back now.
[93:28.31]Okay, we're good.
[93:28.97]Now you're in the front.
[93:31.17]Oh, my God.
[93:36.65]Is it any job to get our weapons back?
[93:38.25]I think we finally got away.
[93:39.52]Yeah.
[93:46.89]Easy for this moat.
[93:50.97]I mean, regardless, the mission's complete.
[93:52.91]No matter what.
[93:53.41]I'm sliding into the water, though.
[93:54.88]Alright, found a shop.
[93:58.42]Hello there, sir.
[93:59.70]Why would I go all the way out here to go out the back door?
[94:04.24]I would like to buy a weapon from you.
[94:07.47]What do we got?
[94:09.91]1,400?
[94:09.99]I'm going to put a silencer now on this.
[94:15.35]I got that scope.
[94:16.39]I still can't afford a silencer.
[94:17.67]$1,700.
[94:18.79]Can I sell anything?
[94:21.73]Shit.
[94:23.19]We need to find some loot and get some money.
[94:25.01]We really do need money.
[94:26.67]I need ammo too.
[94:30.28]Give me ammo.
[94:32.48]That's so much ammo.
[94:34.16]No.
[94:34.28]I don't want that much ammo.
[94:45.99]Why do I need LMG ammo for?
[94:48.57]You're refilling your whole tank, man.
[94:50.03]You're going, like, all in.
[94:51.05]You're gonna rob him blind.
[94:53.57]Can I just buy sniper ammo?
[94:56.83]I think you just buy it all at the same time.
[94:58.53]That's $1,400.
[94:58.99]No, fuck that.
[95:00.91]Get out of here.
[95:03.51]Hey, man.
[95:04.15]Guns aren't cheap, you know what I'm saying?
[95:05.73]I just want one ammo type for my ammo.
[95:09.25]Well, then, you know, pay money.
[95:13.37]Okay.
[95:14.15]Or pick some up off a dead guy.
[95:15.78]Fifteen hundred.
[95:16.80]There's a loot box speaking of loot.
[95:21.80]Okay.
[95:22.10]Alright, give me a sec.
[95:29.82]Got to stock up.
[95:32.01]Yeah, but that's too much money.
[95:33.31]I want to be able to deck out this gun.
[95:37.87]What is that noise?
[95:41.43]I think there's another helicopter plane trying to get us.
[95:47.09]Why are you running all the way over there?
[95:48.01]What are you doing?
[95:55.23]What are you doing?
[95:59.39]Me?
[95:59.46]Yeah, why are you running all the way back here?
[96:02.20]I wasn't running.
[96:02.78]I was just muted for a second.
[96:04.96]Oh.
[96:05.38]Well, here's the road, I guess.
[96:07.46]It's flagged down the nest of an available car.
[96:09.10]I just wanted to get out of the forest because that truck seems spent.
[96:14.33]Alright, let's do something that gets us money, because there's a thing I want to do.
[96:20.77]Like, that's not a story mission.
[96:23.11]There's also a helicopter shop.
[96:24.99]Have we seen that before?
[96:25.85]Okay, well, here comes a... We can take this temporarily.
[96:30.89]Don't blow it up, though.
[96:34.99]I don't have any bullets.
[96:37.37]I cannot... You just lit me on fire.
[96:39.63]Me?
[96:40.17]Somehow.
[96:41.07]I haven't done anything.
[96:41.96]I literally haven't even shot a gun.
[96:45.11]Because my gun's out of bullets.
[96:46.94]You're not the only one who needs ammo.
[96:48.40]Well, I shot that.
[96:49.04]I couldn't shoot through his windshield.
[96:50.64]It's okay.
[96:52.62]Someone else will be around.
[96:53.50]Just get your, you know, stick your thumb out.
[96:57.08]Here's some cars over here.
[97:00.33]Fishing stream, please.
[97:01.67]No, no fishing stream.
[97:05.21]Did you even do that?
[97:06.55]No, the resistance fighters did.
[97:08.15]Oh, good.
[97:08.65]Good job, guys.
[97:10.63]Now let's go take their car.
[97:15.08]Hang on.
[97:15.40]I got something I need to do.
[97:18.42]Something we've been missing, I think, the whole stream.
[97:20.18]You guys have a sign stuck on their car.
[97:25.29]Hey, guys.
[97:27.73]You may have accidentally run over something.
[97:30.77]We're just a mobile sign.
[97:36.69]Oh.
[97:38.21]Hey!
[97:40.91]Come on in!
[97:42.73]It's Diana!
[97:44.49]Did you...
[97:45.73]Did you make her come over here?
[97:46.67]Yeah.
[97:47.67]Oh, OK.
[97:49.15]It's just a sign blocking my view.
[97:53.61]Yeah.
[97:55.95]So if I drive terribly, then that's why, because I can't see because of the sign.
[98:01.44]Regroup with the resistance.
[98:03.86]I'm going we're going to the I just want to see what you can buy from the airplane shop.
[98:10.10]I already have an airplane.
[98:14.89]Can we actually, like, stop that truck?
[98:17.45]No, this is serious.
[98:18.40]Can we go get that truck?
[98:19.46]You want that truck?
[98:20.46]Yeah, I have a pistol.
[98:22.46]That's the only bullets I have.
[98:23.92]Okay, fine.
[98:24.80]And that guy, like, has ammo.
[98:26.26]Fine.
[98:29.78]My primary weapon is literally out of ammunition.
[98:35.91]All right, just drive in front of him.
[98:38.91]Mm-hmm.
[98:41.78]And then slow down after you get directly in front of them?
[98:44.80]Directly in front of them.
[98:45.82]Alright, slow down.
[98:47.92]Go faster, faster.
[98:49.24]Faster, faster.
[98:52.28]There we go.
[98:52.58]Taken care of.
[98:54.56]Okay.
[99:01.52]Loot the truck.
[99:04.42]Release the truck.
[99:07.48]Hey, we can try to do the thing.
[99:09.20]Hey, look.
[99:10.22]There's one of these in here.
[99:12.93]That's it.
[99:13.67]You can have it.
[99:15.11]Do you want it?
[99:17.75]Now I've got eight bullets.
[99:19.39]Cool.
[99:20.21]Diana?
[99:20.57]Diana, do you need anything?
[99:21.85]Alright, um... Stay?
[99:25.98]Stay.
[99:27.66]Yes, I will.
[99:28.28]Good boy.
[99:28.76]Stay.
[99:29.06]You want to get in?
[99:31.88]You're trying to close me in here?
[99:32.82]Is that what you're trying to do?
[99:34.02]No, come stand over here.
[99:35.04]Stand here and crouch.
[99:36.58]Stand and crouch here.
[99:38.16]You're going to try to hit me in the face with this, aren't you?
[99:44.37]Okay.
[99:45.07]I'm disappointed.
[99:48.67]Are you doing that?
[99:49.57]No.
[99:49.79]I mean, can you do it from here?
[99:51.09]Got it.
[99:55.08]All right.
[99:55.86]I just wanted to see if it would, like, make your character model go flying or something.
[100:00.88]I don't think so.
[100:03.12]With this game, I mean, it's pretty polished.
[100:04.46]There's no real kind of major bugs that would probably do that if you tried.
[100:07.68]You know, it's a pretty polished game.
[100:12.18]Alright, let's go.
[100:13.98]Oh, no.
[100:14.42]I'm running on a treadmill.
[100:17.85]Is the car flying?
[100:23.61]No.
[100:24.69]I'm on the ground.
[100:25.45]Are you flying?
[100:27.83]I got out.
[100:28.13]Alright, I think we've permanently broken it.
[100:33.90]Where's Diana?
[100:34.62]Oh, she's on the ground.
[100:36.24]She's dead on the ground over here for some reason.
[100:40.31]Let me in there.
[100:40.97]I want to be in here.
[100:42.11]I want you to drive like this.
[100:43.87]I don't want to be... I want you to just drive with the back open.
[100:46.63]Yes.
[100:46.91]Just stand in the back with the treadmill open.
[100:49.96]Can I make Diana go in?
[100:51.16]Hold on.
[100:52.74]No.
[100:55.66]Alright, I should be able to just sit here.
[100:59.87]Are we going to the story mission, or do you want to... We just need to make money.
[101:03.36]Let's go make some money.
[101:04.92]There's a new toy that I want to play with.
[101:07.16]Make some cash.
[101:08.12]Let's go blow up the silo.
[101:10.44]Just get me in... I got the perfect thing to do that with, man.
[101:15.00]Just get me to the right spot, and I will blow up that silo with one shot.
[101:20.55]I got just the thing for it.
[101:22.21]Are you in the back?
[101:23.03]I'm in the back.
[101:24.05]Okay.
[101:27.05]Just like Kane and Lynch, too.
[101:32.74]Alright, we're almost there.
[101:34.62]We're going to give you a drive-by opportunity.
[101:37.32]A drive-by?
[101:37.86]Oh, you mean for these guys?
[101:39.72]No, for the big, giant red silo.
[101:42.15]Okay.
[101:44.89]Oh!
[101:45.09]Whoa!
[101:49.59]Money?
[101:49.87]Did we get money for that?
[101:52.61]I got roleplay points.
[101:54.08]Oh, we need to destroy 14 of those.
[101:57.26]Let's just go on.
[101:58.46]There's got to be people with guns on the farm.
[102:01.88]I need something besides this Colt 45.
[102:03.44]There's a suitcase over here.
[102:09.02]Remote explosive, shotgun, stick.
[102:15.87]What's over there?
[102:16.81]Guy.
[102:21.13]Ooh!
[102:22.05]That's a POC champ.
[102:25.39]Nice one!
[102:26.77]You didn't get to see that.
[102:27.83]I did.
[102:30.49]You see me lead the guy with the bullet?
[102:32.71]I mean, I watched the whole thing.
[102:34.44]There's this stuff here.
[102:35.34]There's a backpack.
[102:40.64]What else we got here?
[102:42.89]There's a way to get into the treasure barn.
[102:44.61]There's somebody here.
[102:46.65]I'll get him.
[103:01.89]You see me?
[103:02.37]Who sees me?
[103:03.55]Did you do something?
[103:04.55]No.
[103:04.79]Oh, one of the resistance guys just pulled up and is just sitting here.
[103:07.48]I got him.
[103:18.04]I thought he... Okay, now that... I thought he just did that to himself.
[103:21.80]I thought he just shot the wall and blew it up.
[103:24.56]Oh, my lord.
[103:25.36]Okay, whatever.
[103:26.04]Let's... I'm sorry for what I'm about to do.
[103:29.55]Oh, for the gun?
[103:33.24]Fifteen rifle bullets.
[103:34.78]There you go.
[103:36.89]We got two planes?
[103:38.33]Gather three types of bull testicles is our current objective.
[103:43.71]What is happening here?
[103:46.23]Just wanted to point that out.
[103:50.64]There appears to be a plane battle happening.
[103:53.56]This is kind of interesting.
[103:54.42]I feel like I want to watch this for a little bit.
[103:56.46]Two toy cars.
[103:58.04]That was close.
[103:59.08]That was close.
[104:04.23]What is he doing?
[104:11.73]Did you get him?
[104:17.67]There's definitely a war going on, but the bad guy is now focused on us.
[104:23.55]I think he's shooting Diana, actually.
[104:29.58]He is.
[104:30.58]They're gonna crash, and it's gonna be great.
[104:32.76]You know it's gonna happen.
[104:34.40]Oh, yeah.
[104:34.96]It's gonna happen eventually, for sure.
[104:36.16]Where'd they go?
[104:42.45]Shit, I'm down!
[104:43.99]Diana's down.
[104:44.71]Alright, they're like at the maximum altitude.
[104:50.76]Here we go.
[104:56.14]What is he doing?
[104:58.52]Why are they doing this?
[104:59.66]They're just flying upside down by each other.
[105:01.52]They can't get a good target, I don't know.
[105:03.08]Alright, one's hot on his tail.
[105:07.83]He's going for the dive, going for the wraparound.
[105:09.53]He's played Star Fox before in his life.
[105:11.35]Diana just died.
[105:12.79]That's alright.
[105:15.21]This is a pretty intense dogfight we're looking at here, though.
[105:17.24]I'm going to try to interfere.
[105:19.18]No, don't.
[105:22.63]They're trying so desperately.
[105:24.65]Why wouldn't this one be shooting?
[105:28.53]Why wouldn't he shoot at him?
[105:30.27]He has a perfectly plain shot.
[105:33.12]I can see your tracer bullets going right by him.
[105:41.36]Where's our rocket launchers that have lock on?
[105:45.42]I mean, I have a rocket launcher, but I'm afraid to use it here.
[105:48.05]Yeah, but it's just a dumbfire RPG.
[105:51.37]It's just going to go straight.
[105:54.87]Why wouldn't you shoot them?
[105:57.39]I don't know.
[105:57.89]I think they're giving up.
[105:59.41]Unless we can go in the air and encourage them, you know?
[106:01.91]You want to try to get in a plane and just go in the air?
[106:04.19]I think they're going to despawn by the time we get a plane.
[106:07.05]Maybe.
[106:08.60]But there is a helicopter shop not too far down the road.
[106:11.60]What is this?
[106:12.92]How is that aerodynamics?
[106:15.26]You can't just go upside down and spin back around.
[106:17.42]That's not how it works.
[106:23.45]Alright, let's get out of here.
[106:24.85]We've seen this dumb... Wait a minute.
[106:30.49]Okay.
[106:31.49]Oh, it's close.
[106:34.65]Is this a bad guy?
[106:36.84]Yeah.
[106:40.14]We really just need to interfere and... It's not going to happen.
[106:47.60]What do you think about getting a vehicle...
[106:50.59]Let's get in the air and try to get over here.
[106:51.81]Uh-oh.
[106:52.93]What's wrong?
[106:54.49]I have discovered a new toy.
[106:55.51]A new toy?
[106:58.58]Oh, cool.
[106:59.28]That looks like a new toy.
[107:01.78]It was worth trying.
[107:06.26]So we're going to make a jump out of this, right?
[107:07.84]And make cars jump over us?
[107:08.98]No, this is the get the largest vehicle you can on the back of the tow truck.
[107:15.96]And see how the physics interact with each other.
[107:18.10]All right.
[107:18.44]Well, we've got a car here.
[107:20.60]We'll drive the Jeep.
[107:25.58]Line it up.
[107:26.08]You want to get it on?
[107:26.66]Why are they flying World War II planes?
[107:35.21]All right.
[107:36.87]Are you on?
[107:37.21]Okay.
[107:39.89]Are we good?
[107:42.01]We got to hang on.
[107:42.67]Hang on.
[107:42.93]I mean, that's on there pretty good, I think.
[107:45.91]Yeah, but it has to... Okay, well... Can you get inside?
[107:55.53]May not be perfectly lined up.
[107:57.43]That works?
[107:58.49]Okay.
[108:02.39]So you're driving now, too.
[108:05.92]So I'm auto-driving.
[108:08.00]I'm auto-driving so I can get a good look at this.
[108:10.40]I'm curious of what's going to happen here.
[108:16.06]I feel like I'm just going to roll off in a few minutes.
[108:17.80]You might.
[108:21.96]I honestly can't believe this works.
[108:23.46]Yeah.
[108:24.22]The fact that you can drive with a physics object on top.
[108:29.47]Let's test it a little bit.
[108:30.59]What do you say?
[108:37.21]Good.
[108:37.93]That was a good science.
[108:40.32]Okay.
[108:40.66]Well, it's right there.
[108:42.71]I love how we're disappointed that this isn't glitching and breaking.
[108:45.97]How disappointed can you get?
[108:46.91]Oh, come on.
[108:51.68]Really?
[108:51.90]We're stuck in here.
[108:54.66]Oh, wait.
[108:55.52]I might have something.
[108:57.50]I'm just going to parachute over this.
[109:00.04]Get a car on a trailer on a trailer.
[109:01.78]That's not a bad idea.
[109:12.93]I can just go slide through here.
[109:14.46]Alright, shop.
[109:18.82]Helicopters.
[109:21.14]These are too expensive for me.
[109:23.82]Maybe you can afford one of these.
[109:24.76]I think I broke it.
[109:30.12]You broke the whole thing?
[109:32.56]Yeah, is there a way we can find another one of those tow trucks?
[109:36.50]Because what if we did tow truck on top of tow truck on top of car?
[109:40.30]Yeah, I kind of...
[109:43.06]That'd be interesting.
[109:45.40]You wanna get a hel- you know, let's- alright, how about- wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, hold on.
[109:48.79]What if we did... You land helicopter on tow truck.
[109:51.91]It's like, it won't stop.
[109:53.07]Yeah, but you- but you land helicopter on tow truck.
[109:57.49]And then we close helicopter in tow truck, and then you carry tow truck in the air.
[110:02.91]Uh, yeah, I mean, we- What the fuck is that?
[110:05.74]We could do that.
[110:15.96]Where did the smoke bomb come from?
[110:18.18]I think he threw it.
[110:21.04]Okay, let me back this up.
[110:22.87]Get a helicopter.
[110:26.95]Are you the guy who drives the truck with the annoying glitch noise?
[110:30.13]That's okay.
[110:30.79]I'll get out of here.
[110:33.48]And I don't think I can afford a helicopter.
[110:35.66]You can't afford a helicopter?
[110:37.74]I couldn't even afford a new gun a second ago.
[110:41.10]I only have 1100 bucks.
[110:42.86]I might be able to close it in, because if I do this... I do have one that I apparently own.
[110:47.00]So you see what I'm saying here?
[110:49.21]If you get the helicopter to land here, and you kind of wedge it underneath this, and then I close this while you take off, it's possible that you might suck into it and take the whole thing in here.
[111:03.08]Well, this seems a little overpowered.
[111:05.18]Alright, so, easy.
[111:07.73]So come on over here.
[111:15.25]Did you just already ruin it?
[111:16.49]Okay.
[111:25.71]Well, that was... That was worth it.
[111:29.15]That was the wrong button.
[111:30.81]I didn't mean to push that button.
[111:33.48]That was the rocket button.
[111:38.48]Look, I'm going to respawn.
[111:39.80]Just be cool.
[111:42.98]You take this thing.
[111:44.17]Listen, that can make another one.
[111:46.99]Wait, hold on.
[111:48.63]Because I already owned that helicopter.
[111:50.35]It's not permanently dead.
[111:53.67]Here, give me... Where's Scott Slime?
[111:57.19]Who are we even with right now?
[112:01.94]No, give me that gun.
[112:02.82]Here.
[112:03.36]Will he pick up the rocket launcher?
[112:06.10]Pick that up.
[112:08.73]It's the only available weapon.
[112:09.75]Pick it up.
[112:11.65]That's too bad.
[112:12.23]Alright, so your goal... If you choose to accept it... That was so... so not even.
[112:22.38]Let's try to land it in here.
[112:25.44]This guy is so scared.
[112:31.27]Oh, you got him.
[112:32.29]Okay.
[112:36.34]Alright, I'm trying to land it like inside.
[112:38.10]You want to land in there.
[112:41.40]Alright, give me some directions.
[112:42.37]Alright, so I'm going to get right up here.
[112:44.67]So if you go forward, inch forward a little.
[112:46.11]I can't look.
[112:46.71]I can see exactly where you are.
[112:48.03]So inch forward a little.
[112:49.27]Keep going.
[112:49.61]A little bit more forward.
[112:52.33]Up a little bit.
[112:54.03]Okay.
[112:54.63]Forward.
[112:56.47]Stop.
[112:57.93]Straight down from there.
[112:59.99]Okay.
[113:01.05]Keep going a little bit more.
[113:01.79]Can you go forward?
[113:03.61]No, no, no.
[113:04.25]To the left.
[113:06.72]It's like floating by itself.
[113:08.04]Okay.
[113:08.44]Left and then left a little bit.
[113:09.97]Back it up a little bit more.
[113:10.91]Then I'm going to close it on you.
[113:13.25]Okay.
[113:13.57]Now come down.
[113:15.89]Come down.
[113:19.19]Back it up.
[113:22.93]Okay.
[113:26.01]Okay.
[113:26.27]I got it stuck on you, I think.
[113:27.23]Hold on.
[113:28.43]It's trying.
[113:29.35]Can you come down any further?
[113:30.23]Good.
[113:33.65]Okay.
[113:36.65]All right.
[113:36.99]Now, what happens if you... Okay.
[113:38.75]Okay.
[113:39.51]What happens if you move up now?
[113:40.49]It's wedged inside.
[113:43.10]For me... It won't even move.
[113:48.24]But that's what I'm saying.
[113:49.28]I think it's wedged, stuck onto the thing here.
[113:52.08]What happens if you take off?
[113:54.58]Are you stuck in it to a point where... I think it's going to just take off normally.
[113:58.14]We'll see.
[113:59.04]If it does, it does.
[113:59.66]And if it doesn't, then whatever.
[114:02.48]No, that's unfortunate.
[114:04.58]But look up and see what you can do.
[114:07.31]Oh.
[114:08.97]Okay, that's fine.
[114:10.45]Alright, so I'm going to walk with you.
[114:13.77]Let me stay on the ground.
[114:14.51]Let me just drive.
[114:17.55]I'm going to walk.
[114:23.95]I want to be able to stay on the ground.
[114:25.87]Are you on the ground?
[114:26.67]Yes.
[114:27.97]So, just go really fast from there.
[114:31.47]I'm just Sonic the Hedgehog running right now.
[114:35.58]Whoa, what?
[114:41.60]Where did my helicopter go?
[114:43.45]What is that?
[114:49.45]Where did my helicopter go?
[114:51.15]It's gone.
[114:53.27]I'm shocked.
[114:54.67]I have no idea what happened.
[114:56.27]I don't know.
[114:57.21]I think I pulled you out of the helicopter with the fucking rope.
[115:01.67]I think you had the heli- You had the rope around your waist.
[115:05.28]And I pulled you out of the heli- What?
[115:07.38]We gotta do that again.
[115:08.02]There's no helicopter.
[115:08.80]It's just gone.
[115:09.62]You don't have a helicopter?
[115:10.52]No, it's gone.
[115:11.24]No!
[115:12.20]Did you not see me land right in front of you?
[115:21.25]Take your shit.
[115:24.59]Yeah, you landed literally right in front of it.
[115:26.39]Okay.
[115:29.18]You need to spawn that helicopter again.
[115:33.37]That was insane.
[115:34.17]How did you not kill him?
[115:35.85]I was running, running super fast, and all of a sudden you landed directly in front of me and instantly died.
[115:39.55]I know.
[115:40.21]It was perfect.
[115:41.27]I had wanted to do that joke anyway, but that wasn't even my choice.
[115:46.96]Okay, my computer just got hurt by that.
[115:50.78]Yes, no, mine is hurting right now.
[115:54.04]I just went down to like 25 frames per second.
[115:56.26]Spawn that helicopter again.
[115:57.42]We need to do some scientific evidence here.
[116:02.33]Back to the helicopter, people.
[116:07.33]I can make this thing laugh.
[116:09.43]So, wait to do something funny, and I'll give you a good laugh.
[116:13.83]Okay, one sec.
[116:17.42]This is one of the viewers watching right now.
[116:22.86]This is one of the viewers?
[116:24.24]We are Twitch chat truck right now.
[116:32.43]Alright, so, what are you gonna do?
[116:39.42]Remove a fighter to hire a new one.
[116:41.34]I don't know.
[116:42.64]Hang on.
[116:42.92]Let me try throwing something up in the air.
[116:44.65]Okay.
[116:45.53]Why does he have a boat?
[116:51.15]All right.
[116:53.37]He's starting to get upset.
[116:54.45]He's starting to get a little upset.
[116:55.43]That's kind of funny.
[116:57.17]That was funny.
[116:58.69]It didn't work.
[117:05.78]I had my own counter joke set up.
[117:07.42]Was that kind of funny?
[117:08.46]She's aiming at something.
[117:17.19]All right, let's get in here.
[117:19.67]Stupid friendly game.
[117:21.34]So overly friendly.
[117:23.28]We gotta go back and get the helicopter.
[117:24.40]My counter joke was... What was your counter joke?
[117:26.88]I summoned Nick Rye, and I told him to drop a bomb on you.
[117:30.68]Oh.
[117:31.04]So that when I was gonna do this thing, he was gonna roll in, and at the exact same second, you were gonna explode when I did it.
[117:37.74]Oh, okay.
[117:42.64]But because you just moved out of the spot... Uh-huh.
[117:46.89]Oh, well, this one's fine.
[117:52.48]Oh, you got a guy in front of us.
[117:53.28]Uh, help me here.
[117:57.58]Oh my god, am I gonna really die from this?
[118:05.53]Okay.
[118:06.35]How's that kind of funny?
[118:07.41]Where are you?
[118:07.93]Why are you back there?
[118:09.15]Oh my god, did I really just leave you there?
[118:19.00]It's not that funny, guys.
[118:24.45]I just, like, drove by him.
[118:26.63]Alright, get in here.
[118:32.37]Did I just... Seriously, how did I run you over?
[118:34.51]Get... Are you that dead?
[118:43.83]I'm really dead.
[118:46.17]And now I can't even...
[118:49.05]Get in the car.
[118:52.56]Get in the car!
[118:58.74]Get in the car!
[119:08.43]Alright, I-I-I just... You're laughing really hard now, guys.
[119:17.29]You're like wheezing.
[119:25.57]Alright, that's it.
[119:26.43]Get the fuck out.
[119:27.77]Thanks for making me get in the car so you could drive like 20 feet in this direction.
[119:31.87]What do I have?
[119:32.39]A chop.
[119:35.34]A chop.
[119:38.02]Alright, spawn that thing.
[119:44.10]We're going to try that again.
[119:46.54]Hold on.
[119:47.04]Let me send Nick Rye away because he sucks.
[119:57.75]Got ammo.
[119:58.95]Okay.
[120:00.31]There's no more of this, right?
[120:01.95]This thing's empty.
[120:04.35]Take it.
[120:05.59]Hydrate.
[120:06.17]You got it.
[120:08.81]We have to find another car that laps.
[120:13.90]No.
[120:14.00]Are you getting your car back?
[120:14.80]I am.
[120:14.92]No.
[120:30.98]I'm in it.
[120:31.90]Hold on one second.
[120:32.40]To win it.
[120:33.02]Somebody just gave $50 right now.
[120:37.17]Snooze and Copter gave $50.
[120:40.85]Thank you so much, dude, for the $50.
[120:42.63]They say, all right, Germa Theory.
[120:43.77]You ready for this?
[120:44.71]Connect the rope to the helicopter, then go to the back of the truck, close the door with the rope still attached, and then italics takes off with the helicopter.
[120:53.95]That might, hold on.
[120:54.85]I'm going to relay that.
[120:55.87]But thank you so much, dude.
[120:56.99]Appreciate the 5,000 bits.
[121:00.75]Hey.
[121:03.11]Hey.
[121:03.57]Somebody had an incredible idea.
[121:05.36]What if I grapple onto you on the helicopter and then get in a car and you keep going?
[121:10.46]Does that work?
[121:11.12]I doubt that would work.
[121:12.38]Let's try it.
[121:14.82]But thanks a lot, man.
[121:16.16]Let's see if it works.
[121:20.34]Where are you?
[121:25.98]Right here.
[121:31.67]Right?
[121:33.45]Where am I?
[121:34.05]Oh, hang on.
[121:34.67]I'll be there.
[121:38.29]Don't land in the fire!
[121:42.89]Get in the back of a truck.
[121:44.77]I got my teammate.
[121:47.57]Oh.
[121:47.91]Like a pickup truck?
[121:48.77]That's not you.
[121:49.49]Alright, we'll try that.
[121:51.82]Yeah, that was the wrong guy.
[121:52.66]Oh, wait.
[121:55.34]Okay, wait a minute.
[121:55.88]Wait a minute.
[121:56.62]This is an interesting theory.
[121:57.84]So, okay, you know those trucks that the doors close?
[122:01.40]Do I know the trucks that the doors close?
[122:03.52]All right, listen.
[122:04.98]The big Mack trucks with a back can open and close with the tongue that comes out.
[122:09.12]Yeah.
[122:09.46]And you can close it and get in there.
[122:10.68]Uh-huh.
[122:11.78]Okay, what if?
[122:12.93]What if scenario.
[122:14.51]This sounds like it's going to be complicated.
[122:16.05]If I grapple hook onto you, get in there and close the door, and then you take off while I'm inside the truck.
[122:22.53]Can you activate that while?
[122:24.33]I mean, I could try and do it really fast.
[122:26.23]I mean, sure.
[122:27.54]Give it a try.
[122:28.14]We just got to find one of those trucks.
[122:29.76]It's worth attempting.
[122:31.33]Worth a try.
[122:32.16]You know, who knows?
[122:34.18]We gotta take the helicopter with us.
[122:35.54]Okay.
[122:41.52]So you take off.
[122:42.30]I'm gonna hang on.
[122:42.80]Because I haven't done that in this Just Cause game yet.
[122:47.99]Okay.
[122:50.35]I'm gonna help you out here so we can just move on.
[122:52.25]Alright.
[122:53.75]Let's go.
[122:58.23]You there?
[122:59.15]Yeah.
[122:59.47]Come on.
[123:00.45]Okay.
[123:00.61]Okay.
[123:02.11]So we're looking for one of the trucks that we can take down that has like loot in the back of it.
[123:06.69]And what the fuck is going on?
[123:08.63]Alright, be careful because I'm like, this is like actually, I'm flying through the blades right now.
[123:13.26]What is wrong with you?
[123:14.58]What's going on with you?
[123:15.30]I'm going in a straight line.
[123:16.58]You're going in a straight line.
[123:18.18]I am going in a straight line.
[123:19.38]I haven't even changed elevation at all.
[123:22.02]There are three dead people up on the road.
[123:23.88]Yeah, there are.
[123:24.42]I think we have to do something.
[123:26.98]We have to regroup here at the resistance.
[123:28.86]Oh yeah, this is the story mission.
[123:32.27]I'm going to get hit by the blades.
[123:34.25]How are you even that high?
[123:35.41]I just am.
[123:36.41]I don't know how.
[123:37.33]The game's freaking out.
[123:43.85]It's a pretty fun swing, though.
[123:45.47]We're not going to be able to find... Ow.
[123:50.62]I just landed you.
[123:51.80]We're not going to be able to find the truck you want unless we're close to the road, though, right?
[123:55.10]I would assume, yeah.
[123:56.10]We have to find one of those just ammo trucks.
[124:00.21]Wouldn't it be easier to, like, play until we find the truck and then drive the truck to the helicopter spawn?
[124:04.79]It's probably, yeah, you're probably right.
[124:06.20]So let's just go ahead and just, you, just, hold on a second.
[124:09.02]Lower, get down a little bit.
[124:11.10]I want to run with you again.
[124:12.60]Whoa!
[124:13.52]Okay, just stay where you are, just hover there.
[124:15.34]Alright, just don't move, don't move, don't move.
[124:19.88]I want to walk on the ground again.
[124:21.36]Okay, let me just be on the ground.
[124:22.68]Okay, now move just forward.
[124:25.82]I'm holding W. Yes.
[124:30.06]Well, it let go.
[124:32.60]It detached me.
[124:33.46]Let's just do the mission.
[124:43.87]Are you fucking kidding me?
[124:47.39]How?
[124:48.35]Just take off.
[124:50.39]No, fuck.
[124:51.95]I'm like swimming.
[124:58.29]Where are you?
[124:59.21]I went through the earth.
[125:07.38]I thought you were logged in.
[125:09.72]I was for a second and then I got off and decided I was going to swim.
[125:15.46]Alright, will you liberate that cult elf host?
[125:17.24]Listen.
[125:19.88]I'm here.
[125:20.30]Will you liberate it?
[125:21.20]You liberate it.
[125:21.84]I'm the one with the attack helicopter for some reason.
[125:23.94]Alright, I'll liberate.
[125:25.12]Okay, liberation commencing.
[125:30.10]Help these poor people.
[125:32.66]Got it.
[125:33.30]They're all crying simultaneously.
[125:39.80]Yeah, I owe you one.
[125:46.12]Poor choice of words here.
[125:47.16]Hey, you wanted ammo.
[125:48.16]I just heard that.
[125:48.96]I love the noise it makes.
[125:50.46]He was aiming at me.
[125:51.45]There's ammo.
[125:52.15]Yeah, that's what I was saying.
[126:06.47]now we're talking okay so you want me you want me gunner you want me to be gunner uh you can be the gunner with the ai and I'll be covering you in the chopper can you do a great co-op can you just touch can you just touch f for one second for me oh my god what have you done I hit f what you told me to touch f yes that beeped the horn that was I hit f
[126:31.71]Why did F explode the car?
[126:33.63]I just obeyed your instruction because I'm in a helicopter that shoots missiles and the button F shoots the missiles.
[126:48.45]Okay, I'm gonna wait 20 seconds.
[126:54.36]Why would your horn, why would the horn shoot a missile?
[126:58.05]Look, I'm in a helicopter with missiles on it.
[127:00.29]Helicopters don't have horns?
[127:02.05]Yes, they do.
[127:02.98]No, they don't.
[127:03.52]Yes, they do.
[127:04.86]Every vehicle on Earth that is a motorized vehicle has a horn.
[127:09.62]Helicopter horn.
[127:12.32]Now, all of our teammates are dead now.
[127:15.60]Here you go.
[127:19.19]Do they have a horn?
[127:19.87]I'm listening right now.
[127:20.89]Horn?
[127:26.41]Horn?
[127:29.52]They definitely don't have a horn.
[127:32.46]There's a helicopter flying by.
[127:33.54]It's a YouTube video.
[127:35.26]This video has like 100 views.
[127:36.42]Probably fake.
[127:38.61]Let's see.
[127:40.45]100 views.
[127:43.47]Not even a tuber.
[127:45.23]Come on.
[127:47.89]That doesn't have one.
[127:48.94]I think that's the name of a helicopter.
[127:52.54]Helicopter horn.
[128:00.30]Who are these people?
[128:04.20]Oh, these are guys refilling the outpost after the other ones died.
[128:06.88]Helicopter sound effect royalty free.
[128:12.24]Oh my fucking god.
[128:13.36]Get away from me.
[128:15.79]Get the fuck out of here.
[128:17.27]Me?
[128:17.75]No.
[128:18.79]What?
[128:20.63]I'm gonna give up on that one.
[128:22.46]Yeah, you should just let that one go.
[128:23.78]That was a losing battle.
[128:25.12]No, if you had heard what that just was.
[128:27.84]That's enough for me.
[128:29.96]I'm done for the day on that one.
[128:31.04]Did you break turn service?
[128:34.59]Uh, nope.
[128:36.29]Sorry, we're good.
[128:37.65]We can move on.
[128:39.69]Alright, let's make our way.
[128:47.86]Reach the other blockade.
[128:51.96]Good thing that just protected him.
[128:58.66]Why do I not feel safe right now?
[129:02.11]I really just don't.
[129:02.85]I feel like we're driving a car.
[129:05.27]A really fast car.
[129:06.63]Hold on.
[129:06.89]If you kill this guy, you can take his... Which guy?
[129:11.29]There's a horde!
[129:12.35]What was that?
[129:13.94]Do that again!
[129:15.22]I-I didn't push a button!
[129:16.60]Yes, you did.
[129:17.08]You just pressed a button and there was a horn sound.
[129:18.72]I did not push any buttons!
[129:20.09]So what was that sound?
[129:21.57]I was looking at- I kid you not, I was looking over to see if you were playing a horn through... Oh, really?
[129:27.55]...Teamspeak.
[129:28.61]Uh-uh.
[129:32.78]Are you sure you didn't just play a horn through Teamspeak?
[129:34.86]I did not play a horn through Teamspeak.
[129:36.62]What am I looking for?
[129:39.23]What am I taking?
[129:41.23]Oh, the helicopter.
[129:41.99]Isn't it this guy?
[129:43.54]That's the horn.
[129:44.42]Yeah, the helicopter doesn't have a horn.
[129:46.54]It's the Mad Max truck over here.
[129:48.80]How did I die?
[129:49.80]How did I die?
[129:53.68]I did not play it.
[129:54.88]I did not.
[130:00.67]No, why'd you die?
[130:01.55]I was coming to revive you.
[130:02.67]I thought you were still in the air in your helicopter.
[130:04.23]Yeah, well, my guy got blown up and I was coming to pick you up.
[130:08.32]All right, let's do the co-op thing.
[130:09.74]What do you mean, the co-op thing?
[130:14.06]Just get in the gunner.
[130:14.94]Do the co-op thing.
[130:15.70]I did not.
[130:16.52]I did not.
[130:17.60]All right, well, I got 10 seconds.
[130:18.84]Just make your way to the thing.
[130:20.20]Destroy the revolver, the revelator.
[130:23.38]He's, like, 300 meters away now.
[130:25.24]Well, that's what all horn believers say.
[130:27.89]I love how that horn came through, like, while you're talking about the helicopter horn.
[130:34.05]I really thought that you were, like, just doing a elaborate joke.
[130:37.44]Line me up.
[130:46.70]Destroy.
[130:47.07]I'm dead.
[130:47.43]Are you dead too?
[131:08.61]I don't know how.
[131:10.21]No.
[131:12.33]No.
[131:12.93]Oh, boy.
[131:19.20]Why would we be going after that thing with a car like this?
[131:21.72]Why wouldn't we just drop?
[131:22.68]Why would we go in a helicopter and press F and use our horn missiles and shoot it?
[131:27.74]I was.
[131:29.72]That's why we didn't give us the helicopter.
[131:31.12]We're going to use the horn missile.
[131:33.65]I was just trying to do the co-op moment.
[131:35.31]Plus, they do kill the helicopter really fast, honestly.
[131:38.01]Well, it's alright.
[131:38.91]Does this one have horn missiles?
[131:40.92]This one has machine guns, no missiles.
[131:42.86]No horn missiles.
[131:45.62]Okay.
[131:46.28]Why is this acting like this?
[131:48.26]Are you in here?
[131:49.30]No, you do you.
[131:50.70]Okay, I'll do me.
[131:51.52]He's coming down the road, so get ready for him.
[131:53.55]Yeah, I'm ready.
[131:54.15]That doesn't even stand a chance.
[132:04.03]What an anticlimactic finish that was.
[132:06.55]Is there nothing behind him?
[132:08.05]What is that?
[132:08.61]What is that?
[132:09.75]I don't know.
[132:13.89]What is that?
[132:15.74]I feel like you used cheat codes that time.
[132:18.02]Cheat codes?
[132:18.56]No, I just, it's called aim and knowledge.
[132:20.20]Okay, here we go.
[132:21.92]Horn.
[132:33.88]Damn it.
[132:34.62]Go.
[132:35.18]Here it comes.
[132:39.52]Fuck.
[132:40.40]There is no horn.
[132:42.62]All right.
[132:46.23]Can you get it into the cockpit?
[132:48.27]Hold on.
[132:49.39]Can you throw that into the cockpit and hit me right in the face?
[132:52.61]I'm sure I can, yeah.
[132:56.62]If you stop moving.
[132:57.64]Okay.
[132:58.12]How's that?
[132:58.40]A little high.
[132:59.44]A little high?
[133:02.35]You gotta get... Almost.
[133:04.53]That's close.
[133:08.35]Oh, wow.
[133:09.38]That was right almost through the front door.
[133:14.48]The pipe goes like the... The shovel has far more aerodynamic.
[133:21.98]Oh, you've almost broken the glass.
[133:26.18]I don't know what that sound is.
[133:27.64]Have fun.
[133:28.58]Move.
[133:28.86]You better move.
[133:29.56]You better move!
[133:31.30]Why?
[133:34.74]Because I almost just ruined the fun.
[133:35.88]Alright, hold on.
[133:37.08]Break the glass first.
[133:37.86]I'm just going to land.
[133:39.30]Break my front glass.
[133:40.14]Another one.
[133:45.30]Okay, there you go.
[133:45.90]Now do it.
[133:46.76]Now you can be able to... I got to go pick up the weapons first.
[133:48.88]Yep.
[133:50.91]And there's the shovel.
[133:53.57]Okay.
[133:54.49]Going up.
[133:55.47]Hold on.
[133:55.93]Easy.
[133:56.53]You're going to have to hit me twice.
[133:57.59]How am I going to hit you?
[133:59.59]I only have one shovel.
[134:00.87]Well, you got to hit me in the face.
[134:02.59]Make it count.
[134:06.68]I can't even... It goes under the helicopter, and I'm just playing basketball in the backyard by myself.
[134:11.40]Yes.
[134:11.70]Like, anytime I airball, I have to go pick up the basketball from the neighbor's yard.
[134:16.61]You're playing basketball by yourself, and you have to go collect the ball.
[134:19.09]No one's there to rebound.
[134:26.65]What are you hoping to accomplish?
[134:28.39]I want you to hit me right in the face and kill me.
[134:31.72]How'd that not hit you?
[134:32.64]I don't know.
[134:34.57]All right, get down lower.
[134:35.31]Let's see if it's even physically possible first.
[134:37.05]All right.
[134:38.41]Like, do a shot I can't possibly miss.
[134:40.85]You have, like, a big aiming reticule in front of you, protecting you.
[134:43.89]If I hit you from this side... Oh, no.
[134:47.85]All right, let's just go.
[134:51.24]All right, where were you?
[134:55.00]Okay, fuck.
[134:55.58]I'm done.
[134:57.96]What did you just do to me?
[135:03.45]Oh, I was hurt.
[135:05.14]Alright, let's, uh, hold on, let me take care of this first.
[135:13.22]Can I just get these all from a thousand years away?
[135:16.00]Are you just blowing up silos on the other side of the map?
[135:22.22]Yes.
[135:23.78]Okay.
[135:25.02]That's fine.
[135:31.75]I don't think it goes that far.
[135:32.65]I'll take care of it, don't worry.
[135:38.75]Bye.
[135:39.47]I'm just gonna get the silo and I'll come right back.
[135:41.45]Oh, no, no, no, no, no!
[135:42.39]Wait!
[135:43.81]Did you just hit me again?
[135:44.60]Uh, no.
[135:47.26]You're too far from your partner.
[135:48.74]Get back!
[135:49.32]No, I'm getting sniped.
[135:52.57]Let's get in the helicopter and we'll go from here.
[136:06.02]Whoa.
[136:06.30]Wait.
[136:07.50]Here we go.
[136:08.14]Now we're talking.
[136:09.20]Are you good?
[136:09.78]Not exactly.
[136:10.92]Should I take off?
[136:12.12]Yeah.
[136:12.32]I don't think this is supposed to work like this, but it does.
[136:18.54]Where are you?
[136:20.46]I'm around.
[136:21.36]You're around?
[136:21.84]Okay.
[136:22.28]Let's go take out the silo.
[136:25.73]That's good enough, you know.
[136:27.25]You just hanging out on top?
[136:28.69]I'm just hanging out on the side.
[136:31.65]Lino, let's go to Yes Mountain.
[136:32.95]Where's Yes Mountain?
[136:34.03]Oh, Yes Mountain.
[136:35.19]Now we're talking.
[136:36.13]Is it the other way or this way?
[136:37.15]I'm dead.
[136:37.61]What do you mean you're dead?
[136:39.05]I'm standing in front of the guns.
[136:40.71]Oh, why are you standing in front of the gun?
[136:43.49]I'll get you.
[136:45.56]I'm in a body of water now.
[136:47.64]This is going to be hard for me to land this.
[136:49.58]Partner is dead.
[136:50.82]Don't land it.
[136:51.38]I'm full dead.
[136:52.06]Let's go to Yes Mountain.
[137:03.29]Let me go away there.
[137:09.15]Just stir a little bit of, uh... Okay, if we can just get a little money.
[137:13.89]I want to, like, I want to buy a new toy.
[137:15.75]Well, we have a toy here.
[137:16.57]We're going to Yes Mountain with it.
[137:19.73]But, like, there's another toy that I need to buy, and it costs, like, $2,000.
[137:23.63]Repair it?
[137:24.51]Yeah, we can repair this.
[137:26.77]Are you in here now?
[137:29.94]Excuse me.
[137:30.40]What the hell was that?
[137:31.34]All right.
[137:32.34]We need to... I'm going to link by... I've repaired.
[137:34.52]Land or repair.
[137:37.96]Yes.
[137:41.68]I don't know who... Is somebody shooting a bomb at us or something?
[137:46.50]Why can't I use... Oh, hold on.
[137:48.06]I'm going to take care of this.
[137:53.98]What a cinematic angle that was.
[137:55.38]And that took a long time.
[137:58.28]It's a very sturdy vehicle.
[137:59.54]It's American-made.
[138:00.50]Repair.
[138:00.86]Oh, well, it didn't even need it.
[138:06.07]Okay, get back in.
[138:08.69]We got company.
[138:09.61]Oh!
[138:10.07]Oh!
[138:10.37]Company!
[138:10.89]The good kind.
[138:12.09]Yeah, don't shoot it.
[138:13.69]Careful, though.
[138:16.49]Oh, this is the good kind.
[138:18.49]Take care of this.
[138:20.23]I'm getting on the ATV to take him down.
[138:22.11]Alright, I'm in pursuit.
[138:24.87]You can't blow it up, though.
[138:25.73]I'm not going to.
[138:26.21]I'm just going to scare him.
[138:32.21]I'm gonna land on top of him.
[138:33.19]No, I'm not.
[138:33.59]That's gonna ruin everything.
[138:36.19]I gotta... He's so fast compared to the ATB.
[138:52.56]Got it.
[138:53.96]Oh, I almost had it.
[138:54.62]Alright, is that guy... You got him?
[138:58.50]I can't get him in my sights!
[139:02.11]it won't let me got him no I didn't I'm trying to squash him oh god he almost killed me like I couldn't angle can you kill this guy I'm gonna go and turn around and shoot him watch this one you're gonna get separated from me in a second I gotta I stopped
[139:29.67]I'm going to die.
[139:30.81]Done deal.
[139:31.05]It's probably better if I die.
[139:32.03]Done deal.
[139:34.51]Done deal.
[139:34.97]Did you shoot him?
[139:35.91]What are you?
[139:36.35]Oh, I got it, baby.
[139:37.71]Don't worry.
[139:38.95]Okay.
[139:39.97]That's fine.
[139:40.51]Oh, you're dead, but it's all right because you're just going to land on here.
[139:45.40]Yeah, I'll be back in 16 seconds.
[139:49.54]All right.
[139:50.06]I'm going to have you use the helicopter here with this experiment that we're going to do.
[139:59.94]We're flying through high voltage lines.
[140:04.58]What about this?
[140:04.96]Is this good?
[140:05.40]Alright, let's repair this up.
[140:09.22]New fishing spot.
[140:10.04]Really?
[140:10.28]Alright, don't let them blow this.
[140:12.45]There's people coming up the road right now.
[140:15.79]No, they're not.
[140:16.15]They're just... I don't know what the hell they're doing.
[140:24.59]So let me see if I can do this and run in.
[140:26.53]So let's say I was grappled onto you right now and I went like this.
[140:32.56]Yep, I can do it.
[140:34.32]And then I would just need to... Yeah.
[140:37.78]I think this is possible, if we do it correctly.
[140:39.50]Okay.
[140:42.64]Just come back here and hover.
[140:49.47]Okay.
[140:50.37]I think it is actually possible.
[140:51.65]If you were to just hang out right up there.
[140:55.15]I want to get where I can kind of see.
[140:57.59]Yeah.
[141:00.65]down a little bit further so I can actually like walk around because if I grapple like this who the who's who is aiming at me oh you stupid just hold on yeah you got him okay cult vip killed okay so now if I go like this can I interact I can do okay hold on a minute here
[141:24.76]Jesus it like no hold on force you out.
[141:27.62]I just freaked out this home.
[141:29.46]I I jumped too far Come look for come forward a little more.
[141:35.14]I think it automatically this and lower down.
[141:36.72]Maybe like four or five inches big Okay, oh No, no, I okay.
[141:46.12]I see what's going on here stay there.
[141:47.77]Is it cutting the line?
[141:48.73]It's because I'm hitting crouches catching oh
[141:53.37]Oh, no.
[141:54.13]Wait a minute.
[141:56.03]They went right in.
[141:57.63]Here we go.
[141:59.67]This is going to work.
[142:00.41]It just has to be finessed.
[142:01.53]It's got to be finessed.
[142:05.71]I can't jump.
[142:09.95]Got it.
[142:10.79]Stay there.
[142:12.56]This will close.
[142:13.52]The doors are closed.
[142:17.42]Is it actually happening?
[142:18.80]It's probably just going to disconnect the thing.
[142:20.86]Just take it slow.
[142:23.06]It's going to disconnect.
[142:23.84]Very slowly.
[142:27.01]I'm getting pulled up.
[142:28.43]I'm moving very slowly.
[142:32.57]Like, I am tapping S to go backward.
[142:34.81]Yeah.
[142:35.11]Go up, though.
[142:36.77]Try going up instead of out.
[142:38.00]Okay.
[142:40.60]Okay.
[142:40.98]Ah.
[142:41.08]That was a good try.
[142:45.16]Wait.
[142:45.46]Hold on.
[142:45.82]Hold on.
[142:46.06]I'm pretty sure.
[142:48.38]What if I do this?
[142:49.60]I got a better idea.
[142:50.12]The ramp isn't going down anymore.
[142:51.28]Can I do a better idea, though?
[142:52.46]I'm gonna try to wedge myself in behind, like, the boxes.
[142:54.74]Hold on.
[142:58.83]There's no way to even get back there.
[143:00.35]This is possible.
[143:03.41]I think you can get, like, stuck in here.
[143:07.72]We got an enemy airplane?
[143:09.16]Yeah.
[143:16.85]If I can wedge myself in the box, it'll happen.
[143:22.60]We may have an issue.
[143:25.48]We may have an issue.
[143:26.30]What are you doing?
[143:28.70]What do you mean, I'm under fire?
[143:30.08]He's the bad guy.
[143:30.90]There we go.
[143:35.66]What the fuck?
[143:37.38]How is he still alive?
[143:41.35]This is so unfortunate.
[143:44.95]No, I don't think it's gonna work.
[143:49.52]Here's what we can try to do.
[143:50.58]I can grab you from here.
[143:52.30]What?
[143:52.46]And then try to... I'm gonna grab you from here.
[143:54.24]Did you just snipe?
[143:55.71]No.
[143:56.33]So, I don't know who's shooting you, but if you... See how... Do you see where the rope is?
[144:01.47]If you... I'm getting, like, killed.
[144:03.69]Oh, is that... Hold on.
[144:04.81]I'll take care of this guy.
[144:06.01]There's an NPC killing me right now that I can't see.
[144:09.92]He's gone.
[144:11.02]Oh.
[144:12.08]Alright, so put the ramp down.
[144:14.44]There's no ramp anymore.
[144:19.45]I think the ramp might be actually broken.
[144:21.39]There it is.
[144:22.96]Now put the helicopter inside and try to get the doors to close in the helicopter.
[144:26.52]That sounds like a decent idea as well.
[144:28.50]That's probably more likely to do something than... Alright.
[144:36.83]So I don't think it can be closed.
[144:40.33]Well, there it goes.
[144:42.11]And pull it in.
[144:44.75]Oh, it's doing something.
[144:46.71]All right, it worked.
[144:47.55]It worked.
[144:47.93]Get in.
[144:48.83]Grapple onto this.
[144:49.43]It's going to fly away.
[144:52.22]Make sure you grapple it.
[144:53.46]Don't get hit by it.
[144:54.12]Grapple it.
[145:10.78]I have the best ideas.
[145:12.80]All right, let's just do it again.
[145:13.90]Let's find another one.
[145:15.04]No, this is still not done.
[145:15.94]I don't think it's done in my game.
[145:19.36]The helicopter is rotating in place, though.
[145:22.10]All right, well, that works.
[145:25.84]All I heard the whole time was, please kill me, is what they were saying after they fused together and they bashed their heads into the pole until they could die.
[145:36.15]This is still not over, though.
[145:40.72]We need to do that again.
[145:41.48]The helicopter is still floating.
[145:45.62]If this comes down... There's people driving by this.
[145:58.62]There's no gravity.
[146:02.30]Why would you get in the back seat?
[146:10.68]They don't like you very much.
[146:11.68]Oh boy.
[146:19.35]Did we add to it?
[146:21.83]Hold on, I can do this.
[146:30.60]I think this one has stopped.
[146:33.24]The helicopter is still rotating.
[146:38.60]We'll just explode him.
[146:39.54]Alright, I'm attached, I think.
[146:41.88]Or I was.
[146:42.32]Let's free these people.
[146:47.27]Let's free these good people.
[146:49.07]Alright.
[146:49.51]We gotta get another helicopter attempt here.
[146:52.95]Eventually.
[146:58.48]I'm hoping for like a launch.
[147:00.54]You know what I mean?
[147:00.96]Like just catapult the damn thing.
[147:02.90]Let's try that.
[147:03.62]I think that'll work.
[147:06.31]Can you guide me as to get into the way of the catapult?
[147:09.05]Yeah, why don't you just let me drive?
[147:10.39]Can you see the helicopter rotating?
[147:13.03]Yeah.
[147:14.45]Well, it's on the ground right now.
[147:15.69]We need to get it wedged so it flings us.
[147:22.72]Like here.
[147:23.26]Am I in the right spot?
[147:25.30]It's just spinning in random directions.
[147:28.66]I'm trying to get wedged in so it'll flick us.
[147:34.71]It's kind of floating away now.
[147:36.15]There it goes, yeah.
[147:37.19]Shit.
[147:37.41]Oh, it's coming back.
[147:38.09]It's coming back.
[147:39.15]Hold on, I gotta get a better spot.
[147:44.92]Oh, it's so close.
[147:46.54]Come on.
[147:46.94]You were so close to making something happen.
[147:48.42]Come on.
[147:50.43]Right here, right?
[147:51.89]A little further up?
[147:53.31]He's coming down.
[147:53.93]He's coming down.
[147:55.01]Just go a little forward.
[147:58.69]Forward and right.
[147:59.57]Hold on.
[148:03.96]See if I can make this attempt here to jump on it.
[148:06.44]It's more likely it's going to launch the Jeep than launch you.
[148:09.99]Damn it.
[148:10.39]I'm trying to get on top of it.
[148:11.51]It's going to slice my face off.
[148:27.58]All right.
[148:28.12]I think this might be a lost cause here.
[148:30.96]I'm blocking it.
[148:32.74]It's hitting me in the face right now.
[148:36.82]Okay, alright, alright, alright, progress, progress, progress.
[148:39.56]Shit!
[148:41.14]I was on top.
[148:46.10]I'm stuck inside of this stupid thing.
[148:52.13]I had progress there.
[148:53.03]Alright, stay right there.
[149:01.20]Come on, there's definitely like... I've been trying.
[149:06.30]I'm going to shoot it with the rocket launcher.
[149:10.02]You ready?
[149:13.02]Whoa, hold on.
[149:13.65]You almost had it.
[149:16.25]We need to pile a car on top of a car.
[149:19.57]Thanks for helping out.
[149:20.35]I'm just going to shoot it.
[149:22.43]Watch out.
[149:24.25]What if it flipped him up, though?
[149:25.73]That'd be pretty funny.
[149:27.68]All right.
[149:28.74]I think the helicopter...
[149:32.07]No, it's impenetrable.
[149:33.15]Is that you?
[149:35.71]That's not me.
[149:36.47]Alright, let's go.
[149:39.15]We tried.
[149:39.71]We tried to do something with it.
[149:40.95]We tried.
[149:41.25]It was worth it.
[149:41.69]Alright, we say that now and now it's freaking out again.
[149:44.81]Oh well.
[149:46.06]It was worth an attempt.
[149:46.78]There's still a world in which we can get another helicopter and another... Oh, we can try it again.
[149:54.42]It shouldn't be hard.
[149:56.28]We tried.
[149:56.56]Just another normal day in Hope County.
[150:07.94]It was worth one last try.
[150:09.47]Alright, where are we going?
[150:12.41]We're going to go to the yes thing, right?
[150:14.51]We were kind of heading towards the yes sign.
[150:16.57]We need another helicopter or something.
[150:20.73]Can we get a plane somewhere?
[150:22.45]What was that on the... It just popped up.
[150:24.84]I just marked on accident.
[150:27.54]Let's... Give me a mark.
[150:29.36]What do you want to do?
[150:30.64]We should try to go to yes mountain if you want to see it.
[150:33.50]Let's just fast travel.
[150:34.30]Whoa.
[150:35.80]Whoa.
[150:37.65]We're ripping him out of the Matrix.
[150:42.10]He really did just rip us out.
[150:46.14]That's unfortunate.
[150:46.82]It would have been so funny if we could have made an actual helicopter slingshot.
[150:55.61]Cheeseburger the Bear.
[151:01.33]Is this a quest for him?
[151:03.88]Looks like it is.
[151:07.30]Didn't you say you wanted to get the bear?
[151:10.12]Yeah.
[151:11.94]Yeah or nay?
[151:12.88]Nay.
[151:13.24]I'm going to say nay.
[151:16.02]Where are we on the map now?
[151:18.22]We're up way up.
[151:19.24]Isn't the yes sign like up here somewhere?
[151:20.88]Where's the yes sign?
[151:23.44]Can you spawn something so we can get there faster?
[151:28.86]If there is a depot.
[151:33.49]Do we have any loot?
[151:34.39]We haven't done anything.
[151:36.31]We have no loot.
[151:39.40]Look, I want to buy something.
[151:41.20]We're doing this quest.
[151:42.74]We need to do something to get money to do the thing we want to do.
[151:45.22]I don't have any more slots.
[151:50.35]Let me level up first.
[151:51.55]Hold on.
[151:53.57]I have eight points.
[151:56.79]Let me get the two.
[151:58.95]This one here.
[152:00.05]Carry a third weapon of any type.
[152:02.27]Yeah, I want this.
[152:05.55]It's fun to have the rocket launcher, but I also want my actual weapon, too.
[152:09.97]Okay, we're gonna go do the stash real quick.
[152:13.93]We can get some money.
[152:20.85]It's pretty close.
[152:21.65]It's only 400 meters away.
[152:23.89]Only 400 meters away?
[152:25.76]Yeah, it's pretty close, right?
[152:27.14]It's pretty close.
[152:28.98]Alright.
[152:29.34]That's like running distance.
[152:30.68]Alright, let's go.
[152:31.14]Let's do it.
[152:35.64]Liberate Baron Lumbermill.
[152:40.61]Where are you at?
[152:41.51]Right there.
[152:41.85]I'm coming for you.
[152:42.71]Don't... Okay, I was hoping I could break through those logs.
[152:47.60]Shit.
[152:49.04]Shit two.
[152:51.46]Am I gonna get a shit three?
[152:52.98]What are you doing?
[152:53.82]What are you doing?
[152:54.44]I'm just coming to you.
[152:55.74]Shit three.
[152:59.42]This is probably gonna end poorly for me.
[153:04.66]Why?
[153:04.78]Hold on, hold on.
[153:05.87]How'd you get in?
[153:08.84]Hey, dude.
[153:10.12]What on earth is this?
[153:11.40]I'm switching seats.
[153:12.58]Hold on.
[153:14.92]I want to see if I can ride him.
[153:16.62]So don't kill... Are you dead?
[153:21.29]No, but he just knocked over their truck and killed both of them.
[153:27.13]The buffalo has powers.
[153:30.65]Where is he?
[153:31.77]He's over here.
[153:34.27]That is a strong buffalo.
[153:35.51]He's gone.
[153:36.07]He's going, man.
[153:37.93]He's in the gas station somewhere.
[153:39.49]There's a skunk.
[153:40.15]Is that a skunk?
[153:41.19]No, it's a honey badger.
[153:44.14]He's right over here.
[153:49.72]Where is he?
[153:50.14]He's running at you right now.
[153:51.52]He's running around in circles back here.
[153:55.06]I think that's a second buffalo because the one I saw definitely went over this gas station.
[153:58.84]Oh, well, all right.
[153:59.56]You want to get in?
[154:00.72]No, I want to ride the buffalo.
[154:01.60]You're not going to ride the buffalo.
[154:03.72]Remember in Far Cry 4 you could ride the elephant?
[154:06.06]Yeah, but there's no elephants here.
[154:07.82]Is there not a Ride the Buffalo perk?
[154:13.74]Chat, help me out here.
[154:14.60]Is there a Ride the Animal perk?
[154:17.22]Yeah, punk.
[154:20.83]I don't think there is.
[154:30.34]Really?
[154:31.54]Somebody says there is.
[154:32.36]There's a Ride the Buffalo perk.
[154:35.66]Thank you.
[154:36.90]Why does everything I say get doubted immediately?
[154:40.74]What do you mean?
[154:41.52]There's a Ride the Buffalo perk.
[154:44.38]What is it called?
[154:51.15]I'm coming this way.
[154:52.29]I got a buffalo on me.
[154:53.85]Don't worry.
[154:54.17]I'll take care of it.
[154:58.51]Buffalo taken care of.
[155:00.47]What, you were going to ride that one?
[155:02.15]Yeah, I was going to ride that one.
[155:03.29]You were going to ride that one.
[155:06.92]I think you're getting bejaded right now.
[155:10.06]You're getting, like, jebaited.
[155:12.67]All right, get in.
[155:13.19]We need to liberate this field.
[155:15.45]Hang on.
[155:20.25]Whatever.
[155:21.25]I'll ride shotgun.
[155:22.13]You go to... I'm going to go to the town.
[155:23.73]I'll look at my perks.
[155:25.09]You take a look.
[155:25.88]I'm going to liberate.
[155:26.62]You just look.
[155:28.34]No, we're going to my waypoint.
[155:30.96]Yeah, I know.
[155:31.98]That's not an outpost.
[155:33.00]It's like a pepper stash.
[155:34.24]I'll take care of it.
[155:35.48]You just deal with figuring out the perks, and I'll take care of the mission.
[155:40.33]By the time you're out of the menu, you're going to have a mission complete thing on you.
[155:44.03]Well, we both have to pick up the loot.
[155:46.25]Mission complete.
[155:49.92]I'm about to grab it.
[155:56.15]Um... I think, yeah, you have to do this.
[156:02.71]Hey, the one perk I would say is probably worth actually taking in the fourth tier is an additional weapon slot.
[156:09.01]Why can I not take anything?
[156:10.31]What's going on?
[156:11.71]Yeah, I got that one already.
[156:12.83]Oh, wow.
[156:14.42]I can't interact with any objects.
[156:15.78]Oh, wow.
[156:18.62]Uh...
[156:22.43]Is there a reason for this?
[156:32.40]Okay, that was weird.
[156:37.33]Why can I not interact with this?
[156:41.01]Do we have to sneak in here?
[156:49.54]Try pressing E. E doesn't do anything.
[156:52.54]Can't get it to do anything.
[156:54.40]Okay.
[156:55.32]What do you want?
[156:56.42]I can't... Can you touch this?
[156:58.92]This thing here?
[157:00.56]I can read the note.
[157:01.36]Okay, I couldn't do that.
[157:03.58]Can you interact with the plane thing in here?
[157:05.18]You broke the generator.
[157:06.38]I'm off to get Shep to come fix it.
[157:08.30]I swear to God, if you left the skylight open again, I'm going to fire you.
[157:12.42]So get on the top of the building.
[157:15.56]Buy and customize planes here.
[157:17.64]Yeah, I already got a plane.
[157:20.83]We have to find a way to get into the hangar.
[157:22.31]That's the whole thing.
[157:23.19]What about this door?
[157:24.59]Can you read this note?
[157:26.21]I can.
[157:27.57]There's something rotting on the roof.
[157:29.31]I saw an eagle perched upon the nearby radio tower with something in its claws.
[157:32.84]Pretty sure it glided over and dropped that sucker down.
[157:35.18]It's baking in the sun.
[157:36.88]Go clean it up.
[157:39.28]Radio tower?
[157:40.98]Yes, radio tower.
[157:42.20]Found it.
[157:51.58]So what are you carrying for your second weapon?
[157:53.44]Rocket launcher.
[157:54.72]Oh.
[157:55.46]Yeah, that makes sense.
[157:56.08]For the theatrics.
[158:02.02]So where is this thing supposed to be?
[158:07.37]Uh, well, there's definitely grapple points to get up the tower.
[158:14.61]You having some keyboard problems there?
[158:15.95]Why did I die?
[158:19.57]Did I grab the wires?
[158:22.88]Are you dead?
[158:23.83]I died.
[158:24.21]Oh, you're full dead.
[158:28.61]Okay.
[158:30.67]What happens if I spawn on you now?
[158:31.93]Hang on.
[158:35.01]Don't spawn yet.
[158:39.16]Okay, spawn now.
[158:40.10]I got two seconds.
[158:40.68]Okay, spawning on you.
[158:48.24]Well, exactly what we thought may have been a reality was a reality.
[158:55.12]I wish you couldn't see what I was doing before you spawned on me, though.
[158:57.80]That would make it better.
[158:59.69]Did you get the eagle shit?
[159:02.45]I don't really quite understand what I'm supposed to be doing up here.
[159:05.67]Let me spawn on you again.
[159:06.55]Just don't move.
[159:13.59]Okay.
[159:19.25]Okay.
[159:21.61]I didn't do any of that, but I just did.
[159:23.39]That's fine.
[159:26.19]What'd you do?
[159:26.89]I spawned on you and I was on the zipline.
[159:29.43]I'm gonna grapple on that.
[159:33.55]Let me up there.
[159:34.97]What did the... Okay, so the no... Maybe we wingsuit over... I'm gonna wingsuit over to the roof.
[159:39.73]That's probably a good idea.
[159:40.59]I would love to do that fun thing.
[159:43.11]Well, then grapple.
[159:44.05]Use your grapple.
[159:44.82]I can't.
[159:45.28]I'm not... How do you get in there?
[159:48.22]The first place.
[159:49.92]No, this just opens.
[159:51.02]Alright, here we go.
[159:51.92]Bingo.
[159:56.99]That actually worked out pretty well.
[159:58.29]I don't know if that's what you're supposed to do, but here I am.
[160:01.71]I'm sure you are supposed to just do that.
[160:07.52]You know, I'm sure, yeah.
[160:11.50]So wait, how did you... You wingsuit and then parachuted.
[160:14.26]Alright, so I shift, like sprint, jumped off the side.
[160:18.33]Then when prompted, hit shift, tap shift to open the wingsuit.
[160:21.73]Right.
[160:22.11]And then you parachuted again.
[160:23.31]Pull up with S. Okay.
[160:25.17]To try to stay airborne and then you... Why don't I just do this?
[160:29.77]Oh, wait a minute.
[160:33.68]I fucking knew it.
[160:34.90]I knew you were gonna try to do something fucking weird.
[160:40.02]Just get the item.
[160:42.53]I'm just looking out, like I knew you were gonna do something fucked up.
[160:51.02]Get down here and open the door for me.
[160:52.52]Be my AI partner in Resident Evil 5.
[160:58.75]I didn't even hit you is the funniest part.
[161:00.37]Yeah, you would try- I was- That's why I switched between the two.
[161:04.97]Alright, nice.
[161:05.55]Opened up the hangar.
[161:07.73]Fucking jaded.
[161:09.51]Ooh, look at this thing.
[161:11.49]This thing is nice.
[161:12.41]There's a bunch of skill points over here.
[161:15.22]Ooh, a skill point?
[161:16.88]Four skill points.
[161:19.74]And a secret statue of Yogi Bear.
[161:22.82]Where are they?
[161:23.48]Did you take them all?
[161:25.16]They were right here.
[161:25.74]Did you not get any?
[161:26.58]Oh, one, one, two, wait.
[161:28.26]Got them.
[161:28.70]Three.
[161:29.06]Nice.
[161:30.82]And the secret statue.
[161:32.04]Secret statue.
[161:33.60]What is in here?
[161:34.04]What are these, like, nuts and bolts?
[161:36.43]Okay, so you can actually, like, make more dynamite.
[161:40.51]That's what that's for.
[161:42.25]Hey, I didn't get it.
[161:43.41]You got it.
[161:44.47]It's because I'm player one.
[161:46.13]I'm the only one that matters in this video game.
[161:48.07]Let's do a Far Cry arcade spin.
[161:49.66]No, I don't want to do that.
[161:50.40]Did you get all the money?
[161:54.14]Didn't even see it.
[161:54.72]Thanks, bro.
[161:58.56]I'm not going to land down straight.
[162:01.60]Alright, let's... It's probably a quest for the plane, maybe.
[162:06.18]This one actually has a gun on it.
[162:08.04]It's just lore.
[162:08.74]It could just be lore.
[162:10.22]This thing actually has a machine gun.
[162:16.18]Before that guy ruins everything.
[162:18.95]Good work.
[162:24.41]Okay, maybe it's not.
[162:25.59]Thought it might have been a quest.
[162:27.39]I got the gun.
[162:27.93]You want to take control?
[162:29.03]Hang on.
[162:29.35]I got to listen.
[162:31.47]There's an obstruction of justice in the way.
[162:37.08]Let's get in a dogfight.
[162:38.26]You know what I'm saying?
[162:38.96]I want to get in a dogfight in the air.
[162:40.18]It'll be fun.
[162:45.36]Battlefield 1 lore?
[162:46.08]All right.
[162:50.30]I got to be careful because you can shoot.
[162:51.56]There are bombs and missiles on this plane.
[162:53.62]You can shoot the plane.
[162:55.42]The actual plane?
[162:56.08]Yeah.
[162:56.30]Is it damaged?
[162:57.82]I don't know.
[162:58.14]It might be.
[162:58.96]Use the teeth cleaner on it.
[162:59.88]There you go.
[163:03.68]Battlefield 1 lore masters.
[163:07.74]All right.
[163:07.94]Let's do something fun here.
[163:10.21]Nice.
[163:10.53]Fun.
[163:10.65]Okay, where are we going with this, though?
[163:12.79]Um, I don't know.
[163:14.07]Woo!
[163:15.07]Don't, don't blow the horn.
[163:16.63]Okay, there's somebody coming.
[163:17.83]You better, we have to, I can't aim that far.
[163:19.69]Alright, they're good.
[163:25.22]Taken care of.
[163:27.22]Oh, I got an interesting view here.
[163:30.18]Okay, well, um.
[163:31.72]Hollywood yes sign.
[163:35.50]This thing is cool.
[163:37.22]I like this thing a lot.
[163:39.19]What are all my buttons again?
[163:40.19]I don't know.
[163:41.17]What are they?
[163:41.57]You can drop bombs?
[163:44.44]I can drop bombs, yeah.
[163:49.82]Can you shoot that guy?
[163:53.04]No.
[163:54.39]Not like this.
[163:55.61]Not like this.
[163:56.49]No way.
[163:59.21]Oh, no.
[163:59.55]Well, it can't do that like that either.
[164:01.27]Okay.
[164:03.01]I almost crashed, but it's fine.
[164:04.17]We're back.
[164:04.55]All right.
[164:07.42]Where's the yes symbol?
[164:08.74]I think it's like on the other side of the map.
[164:10.18]I think I took us to the wrong place.
[164:12.76]Oh, come on.
[164:15.20]You look on the map.
[164:16.04]I don't know.
[164:16.92]You're the one with the best view.
[164:18.86]Am I?
[164:19.16]Are you sure?
[164:19.56]I'm looking backwards.
[164:21.58]I don't see yes anywhere.
[164:24.52]I don't know.
[164:25.62]Is it on the mini map?
[164:26.56]Is it on the actual map with the yes symbol?
[164:28.40]I don't see it anywhere.
[164:29.04]I don't think it's on the mini map.
[164:30.12]It's not on the actual map.
[164:30.88]There's like an outpost to your right.
[164:34.02]Just drive around.
[164:34.48]We'll find it.
[164:39.08]Yes.
[164:39.38]I mean, it should be visible from a long way away.
[164:41.42]That's not it over there.
[164:42.68]Can you see my tracer ammo?
[164:46.94]I mean, you're facing the other direction from me.
[164:49.04]I don't think that's it.
[164:50.42]There's something over there, though.
[164:52.36]This map is huge.
[164:54.86]Why are we dying?
[164:56.24]Why are we dying?
[164:57.18]I'm smoking.
[164:57.74]Like, my engine is smoking.
[164:59.79]I don't know.
[165:00.81]Are you shooting it?
[165:01.61]No.
[165:03.47]Yeah, we're, like, dying.
[165:04.87]Why are we at, like, 50% health?
[165:07.21]I don't know.
[165:07.63]I was just flying in a straight line with the map open.
[165:09.83]We didn't hit anything.
[165:12.15]We drove through like a bunch of trees.
[165:13.37]I just didn't even notice.
[165:15.55]I don't see yes.
[165:24.44]Hmm.
[165:26.84]I see church.
[165:30.76]No yes.
[165:46.49]I feel like I need to land somewhere and make this pain go away, you know?
[165:51.37]Uh, if you land we can use the teeth planer.
[165:55.37]Find me an airport.
[165:57.15]Um, I wouldn't land in the water.
[166:01.02]Not the plan.
[166:04.28]Oh my god, why would I even listen to somebody that said that?
[166:08.90]What am I fucking serious?
[166:12.06]You know you're being chased!
[166:12.86]Of course I've got a plane on my tail now!
[166:14.78]Why was I... Where's my tail gunner?
[166:16.96]Somebody said press E to prepare the fucking plane!
[166:21.46]Alright, alright, I'm slowing down.
[166:24.97]I can't do anything about it.
[166:27.95]Why of all times... Now I've got an actual dogfight!
[166:32.61]I can't believe I looked over a chat and pressed E. What was I thinking?
[166:39.47]That's what I'm talking about.
[166:40.53]That was perfect.
[166:41.37]Beautiful.
[166:41.89]Alright.
[166:44.17]I don't know why I even thought that.
[166:45.23]I don't even need you.
[166:45.83]For a second, I pressed E. Just, oh, E. I'm streaming this by myself at this point.
[166:49.59]I'm gonna just press E. I can't fucking believe it, dude.
[166:54.55]I'm gonna try to land up on this, like, hill up here.
[166:56.73]I might be able to grapple you.
[166:59.32]I just can't.
[167:00.16]Not when I'm in the water.
[167:00.90]Just keep circling.
[167:01.54]I'm actually gonna be up.
[167:02.86]Yeah.
[167:04.26]Maybe I can grapple and then... My plane is hurting right now.
[167:09.42]I did get an awesome shot of the fight.
[167:10.72]I did.
[167:11.00]I did get to see your theatrics there.
[167:17.35]Almost to land.
[167:19.69]Okay, let me see if I can do this.
[167:25.07]So sweep on back.
[167:25.93]I wonder if I can grab... Ooh, too far away.
[167:28.97]Uh-oh.
[167:31.27]Okay.
[167:32.39]Can I just grab you from here?
[167:34.37]E. E.
[167:38.84]No.
[167:39.10]You're either too high or you can't grab onto a plane.
[167:41.83]I'll come back.
[167:42.39]One more pass.
[167:44.49]If I can live that long.
[167:45.63]Okay.
[167:49.67]No.
[167:49.87]I don't think so.
[167:51.57]Alright.
[167:51.81]I'm going to try to either land this or kill you and make you respawn.
[167:55.57]Okay.
[167:56.47]Just rain hell on me.
[167:58.95]Just shoot the hell out of me.
[168:00.23]I believe I can do this.
[168:01.78]You're not going to be able to land that.
[168:02.80]You're going to be going so fast.
[168:03.66]It takes a long time to slow down.
[168:14.58]was that well you you landed you did it huh I never would have guessed you repaired I did oh I didn't know there's a huge open field here okay still smoking for some reason but I think it's fully repaired
[168:39.82]Can't I stand on the back like this if I just... Let's try it, just for fun.
[168:43.16]I mean, you definitely can until I turn it too tight.
[168:46.08]So just don't turn it.
[168:48.08]What?
[168:48.72]Just don't turn it.
[168:49.80]That's literally the only way to steer the plane is to turn it.
[168:52.37]Just try.
[168:52.97]You know what I'm saying?
[168:53.77]Just try it.
[168:54.69]Are you going to make me land again?
[168:56.25]No, I'm not, because I'm just going to die.
[168:58.01]If this doesn't work, I'm just going to go drown.
[169:04.17]Okay.
[169:04.95]Press E to repair.
[169:11.54]Okay, I'm still fine.
[169:14.58]Just don't do any sharp turns.
[169:17.80]Pretty sure you're actually weighing the back of the plane down.
[169:20.00]By the way, what is the difference between what I'm doing right now and sitting in the chair?
[169:26.27]There is no difference.
[169:26.93]The chair has a 50-cal machine gun.
[169:30.05]I'm having to turn so slow to try not to turn you off.
[169:32.29]Just don't do anything crazy.
[169:35.14]You're weighing the back of the plane.
[169:37.16]I have to pee so bad, so I'm going to keep like this and just get us to the next destination.
[169:40.90]No, I have to keep hitting W to stop from steering up.
[169:45.08]That's fine.
[169:46.58]Are you in the gunner seat?
[169:47.96]There is an actual plane.
[169:49.07]There's a plane here.
[169:50.57]I don't know.
[169:50.87]I just got spotted by somebody.
[169:52.53]You're fine.
[169:53.39]I really do need to use the bathroom really badly, so just make sure I don't die.
[169:56.29]You're turning a lot, and I'm fine.
[169:59.55]Okay.
[170:00.31]Fine.
[170:01.03]Hurry up.
[170:01.47]Entertain the audience.
[170:02.21]I'm just going to piss my pants.
[170:05.52]Hello, audience.
[170:14.54]That is a loud door.
[170:17.09]What an annoying door.
[170:18.41]Alright, where should I drop him off is the actual question.
[170:23.59]Or, is there a world in which I can just jump out of the plane and let him keep flying?
[170:32.53]Man, I'm not sure where the...
[170:35.58]He's already still here.
[170:42.14]He's like off the plane now, though.
[170:50.49]See you later, buddy.
[170:53.29]Nice little tail whip.
[170:56.77]Is he still on the back of the plane, Chad?
[170:59.19]I physically can't see him if he is.
[171:00.59]We're going to do a loop-de-loop.
[171:02.01]I think he's gone, though.
[171:06.65]But it hasn't said your partner has died.
[171:08.37]So is he in the back?
[171:12.31]Ah, maybe it did say partner died.
[171:13.53]Let's find that sign.
[171:23.37]What direction is it?
[171:28.76]Oh, there it is.
[171:29.26]Alright, I'll do something productive though.
[171:35.90]You got him.
[171:38.11]Yeah, I guess it did say, and I just didn't notice.
[171:39.86]Now, is there a way that I can get out without parachuting and let the plane fly itself?
[171:47.34]Like, what's it called when the guys, like, get out of their trucks and ride on top of the hood while it's still going?
[171:58.33]I feel like I have to try.
[171:59.33]It may just parachute me down automatically, though.
[172:04.89]Ghost riding.
[172:05.81]Yeah, that's the one.
[172:08.91]Am I dead?
[172:19.58]What happened?
[172:30.87]Did I come back right when I died?
[172:32.33]I had to go pee too.
[172:34.35]What happened?
[172:35.67]Wait, hold on.
[172:36.13]We both were going to the bathroom.
[172:38.35]I thought you were telling me to go pee.
[172:41.49]Huh?
[172:44.10]Wait, wait.
[172:44.72]So I went pee, and then you went pee, and you were still flying the plane.
[172:49.44]Like, I was just letting a ghost pilot, you know?
[172:54.19]Well, what the heck?
[172:57.87]Don't believe him.
[172:58.81]Okay.
[173:00.07]I'm getting jebaited.
[173:06.55]The yes thing is somewhere down here.
[173:08.33]Alright, let's find it.
[173:10.67]Now when I actually have to go pee.
[173:12.93]No one's gonna believe me.
[173:15.74]Metallics with the 4D chest.
[173:21.44]Oh, come on!
[173:24.10]We're fine.
[173:26.18]We're fine.
[173:28.62]4D chest!
[173:32.14]Isn't it this way?
[173:32.76]Am I going the right way?
[173:34.59]Can you find this stupid sign?
[173:35.77]I don't know where it is.
[173:36.97]We're going to be so disappointed when we get there.
[173:38.59]No, this is the whole point of this whole stream.
[173:43.13]What was that?
[173:43.73]I accidentally right-clicked, and those are rockets.
[173:49.78]I feel like it's on the... Yeah, there it is.
[173:51.26]It is actually on the map.
[173:53.04]There it is.
[173:53.72]Found it.
[173:54.12]Nice job.
[173:55.18]Found it.
[173:55.78]No, I found it.
[173:58.06]$1,000 to refill all ammo.
[173:59.79]In the air?
[174:00.79]What?
[174:02.45]Oops.
[174:05.19]Will you stop doing Diablo 2 Necromancer teeth for a second?
[174:09.89]What?
[174:10.31]That is a fucking 4D chess reference I just had.
[174:13.23]That's like a 90s boys reference.
[174:16.21]Alright, so what's the game plan here?
[174:19.93]The game plan is fly between the Y and the E. Oh, okay.
[174:23.52]Well, you have a good luck with that.
[174:25.94]Because I'm just going to get out.
[174:28.74]No, you're not.
[174:32.70]I'm flying faster without you in here, Fatty.
[174:35.58]I forgot to press the button, but I'm fine.
[174:39.14]Ooh.
[174:40.96]All right, let me get a good, like, image.
[174:44.26]Come on.
[174:45.10]Why are we not watching that?
[174:46.56]You got to take a picture.
[174:47.18]I got to take a picture of you going through the Yes logo.
[174:49.00]Do it again.
[174:49.88]I already, I went through both sides.
[174:51.77]I went through the Y and the E, then came back through the E and the S. Yeah, but, like, the photographer wasn't ready.
[174:56.09]Do it again.
[175:00.37]Beautiful.
[175:09.13]Just repair it.
[175:09.79]It's fine.
[175:11.46]Just keep it repaired.
[175:12.36]I'll get it.
[175:12.84]Don't worry.
[175:14.34]We have to destroy the billboard.
[175:17.80]Flip it.
[175:19.46]Keep flipping.
[175:24.60]There's a fucking tree in the way.
[175:26.22]Almost there.
[175:27.97]Okay, there we go.
[175:29.05]Wow, what excellent fucking 4D chess!
[175:32.51]How are we going to get through the trees?
[175:33.95]I don't know.
[175:34.65]That's your job, not mine.
[175:38.42]Don't go anywhere.
[175:38.82]Let me make sure it's perfect.
[175:39.88]Okay, you just keep driving.
[175:43.22]I'm going to keep repairing.
[175:45.76]Can you drive it?
[175:46.32]Yeah, I got you.
[175:51.74]That's fine.
[175:55.25]I may be stuck on this.
[175:56.57]I'll push it.
[175:59.01]Can you get me out of here?
[176:01.33]Where are you?
[176:01.97]I was trying to repair it the whole time that you were driving, and it fell down.
[176:04.75]I watched very cleanly between two trees.
[176:06.77]Well, just stay there for 20 seconds.
[176:10.41]Just stay there.
[176:10.87]It's flashing.
[176:11.73]It really wants me to refill all ammo like bad.
[176:16.29]It's just flashing on the screen for some reason.
[176:18.97]Why does it want you to refill ammo?
[176:20.49]It's $1,000, and you're dead.
[176:23.51]Just stay there for 15 seconds.
[176:24.90]I'll repair you.
[176:30.22]Don't shoot a missile.
[176:31.58]We need to destroy the yes symbol.
[176:36.60]Three, two, one.
[176:39.67]Spawning on you.
[176:42.55]Okay, exit vehicle.
[176:51.48]Somebody tell me what happened.
[176:52.76]What happened?
[176:53.58]Somebody needs to explain that.
[176:55.98]Honest to fucking God, explain to me how that happened.
[176:58.04]I don't know.
[176:58.90]I don't understand.
[177:00.54]I swear to fucking God.
[177:02.46]Somebody tell me what I did.
[177:15.79]Clip it.
[177:16.07]I want to see it.
[177:16.53]Somebody clip it.
[177:17.01]Clip it right now.
[177:17.55]Somebody do it, please.
[177:18.73]Clip that right now.
[177:19.33]I need to see it.
[177:23.78]I swear on my whole life that was not intentional.
[177:27.06]I need to see what I did.
[177:36.37]I need to see it.
[177:38.45]Give this to me.
[177:39.61]Because I fucking don't understand.
[177:43.61]Get out of the car.
[177:44.41]Exit vehicle.
[177:45.01]Exit vehicle.
[177:45.67]Okay.
[177:46.79]Holding the repair tool right here.
[177:48.14]I move over.
[177:48.84]Oh my fucking god.
[177:52.00]Because I didn't think I had it out, and I thought I... Repair.
[177:58.34]What a fucking idiot.
[177:59.24]Like, I really did not mean to do that.
[178:00.96]I promise you.
[178:01.80]Under every single circumstance.
[178:03.90]I didn't expect to have the repair tool out immediately.
[178:07.48]Oh, but that seems like such a forced joke.
[178:10.15]And I swear to God, that is not what happened.
[178:12.75]Fucking God damn it.
[178:18.87]What are you doing?
[178:26.56]Out of bounds.
[178:32.86]What keeps happening to us?
[178:40.11]The rocket launcher was the first weapon.
[178:41.83]I thought I had to hold Q and... I realized that I... Fucking moron, I swear to God.
[178:55.22]Am I muted right now?
[178:57.26]No.
[178:57.78]He is.
[178:59.08]I'm muted.
[178:59.78]No wonder I couldn't communicate to you.
[179:01.58]Let's do this now.
[179:02.36]That was not intentional.
[179:03.64]You've asked like three times, why are we dying?
[179:05.88]There was another plane that is shooting us.
[179:07.73]Yeah, that was not on purpose.
[179:09.83]As much as it probably looked like it was and probably felt like it was, it wasn't.
[179:13.07]I can assure you.
[179:14.87]Apparently I'm muted.
[179:16.07]I'm not anymore.
[179:16.87]Alright, let's go.
[179:23.46]Because in my brain, I saw the burn tool in my hand, so I pressed Q, but then I was like, wait, it was in my hand already, so I let go, I didn't think it was selecting anything, and I just pressed... He's gonna drive right into it.
[179:38.93]Is that what he's doing?
[179:47.37]Got him.
[179:48.99]Did you, though?
[179:50.43]Yeah.
[179:52.95]Oh, my fucking god.
[179:55.37]Yeah, I did.
[180:07.18]No, no, we can't do it.
[180:13.58]Oh, my fucking, ow.
[180:18.40]No, we can't do it.
[180:26.36]Oh, my whole face is sweating.
[180:29.97]Wait.
[180:30.25]Oh, I can't.
[180:30.85]So, we're good.
[180:31.61]We're back.
[180:31.99]We're fine.
[180:32.57]We're back.
[180:33.01]We're back.
[180:33.61]And we're back.
[180:35.90]Watch out for the other plane.
[180:37.10]All right.
[180:38.94]You gotta... You gotta...
[180:50.53]Why am I out of bounds?
[180:52.07]Alright, do you want me to destroy the yes thing?
[180:55.97]You need to destroy the yes symbol.
[180:57.73]Okay.
[181:00.55]I can't even... The tail is in the way.
[181:02.29]I can't shoot him.
[181:02.87]Is there a second plane?
[181:11.24]There are two planes behind us.
[181:12.30]Ugh.
[181:13.74]Ugh.
[181:22.74]I don't even know where you're going.
[181:24.72]I'm in hot pursuit right now.
[181:27.34]There is a second plane.
[181:31.03]What?
[181:31.25]Is that a seaplane?
[181:33.29]That's a seaplane.
[181:35.79]It just crashed directly into it.
[181:38.83]What's wrong with this plane?
[181:39.59]My engine's stalling.
[181:41.09]Okay, we're fine.
[181:42.60]Are we?
[181:43.16]Are you sure?
[181:43.62]Yeah.
[181:49.99]I'm going to get out and I'm going to help.
[181:51.91]I actually am getting out.
[181:57.72]Who's the other explosion?
[181:59.30]I don't know.
[181:59.68]Maybe the other guy.
[182:00.38]I'm going to shoot it with the rocket launcher.
[182:05.00]I have the damn thing.
[182:05.76]Might as well use it.
[182:06.36]This one's pretty much destroyed.
[182:11.77]We're like at 50% right now.
[182:15.05]I think the whole... Does that count up there?
[182:17.39]This bright side?
[182:26.84]I'll get the last bit over here on the right.
[182:28.06]Alright, I think that's it for this.
[182:34.72]Just the other side.
[182:36.56]Okay, easy with those bombs.
[182:40.22]Easy.
[182:42.92]You're intentionally doing this now.
[182:44.50]I can smell it on you.
[182:45.70]That was just once.
[182:46.54]No, I can smell it on your breath that you did that on purpose.
[182:49.10]Yeah, that one I did.
[182:50.99]Yeah.
[183:01.18]That little bump.
[183:02.02]Okay, you need to come get me.
[183:05.32]Oh, really?
[183:05.90]That was a pretty cool backflip.
[183:18.52]Do I need to come get you?
[183:21.82]Can you fly... Okay, hold on.
[183:23.08]Let's see if you can do this.
[183:23.80]Let's see how much of a skilled gamer you are.
[183:27.58]Can you fly...
[183:30.39]Underneath.
[183:31.09]No, I don't- I don't- I'm not- No, doesn't even matter.
[183:34.63]I'll just teleport to you.
[183:37.36]Okay, do you want to go back?
[183:38.44]What did you want to do?
[183:39.28]No, it's alright.
[183:39.64]It's fine.
[183:40.38]I just want to see if you were a good enough gamer to, like, actually drive through one of those holes and hit me while I'm on top, like, while I'm standing on it.
[183:48.17]Depends on how good of a gamer you are.
[183:51.19]I mean, that's- I mean, that's pretty impressive, but I gotta be stand- Like, just go up really high.
[183:56.37]Oh my god, dude.
[183:57.21]What the fuck?
[184:05.62]I was trying to get the second one, man.
[184:07.90]I got one.
[184:08.44]I needed to get the other one.
[184:09.96]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[184:16.06]I don't know why, but the plane, like, delayed explosion is what gets me.
[184:20.31]Like, I crash straight into something if it takes a full second to decide to explode.
[184:26.49]All right, where are we going, Captain?
[184:29.81]We're going... Why am I the captain?
[184:32.22]Well, yeah.
[184:33.30]What do you want?
[184:33.74]We've killed the S sign.
[184:35.08]Now what?
[184:36.48]We're blowing up the scenery, the landscape.
[184:38.36]All right.
[184:41.88]Give me a sec.
[184:42.55]Well, you figure that out.
[184:43.47]Okay.
[184:43.85]So are we going to do like a switcheroo where I fly the plane?
[184:48.19]If I get out, I've already tried this joke.
[184:49.93]If I get out, I will just fly away.
[184:53.07]Are you actually going to BRB?
[184:55.89]No.
[184:56.55]I was just going to respond to somebody.
[184:59.49]Who are you texting?
[185:02.42]Oh, okay.
[185:03.26]All right, go ahead.
[185:04.70]I'll see you in a little minute.
[185:05.48]I thought you were like, oh, I've got to answer somebody.
[185:07.56]Hold on a minute.
[185:08.22]I've got to put my phone call.
[185:09.40]I mean, we could go... The chat?
[185:10.86]What do you guys want to see?
[185:33.67]Or do you want to see... That's a lot of options.
[185:36.49]Find the other helicopter and lodge it into a closing door.
[185:40.67]You're giving them a lot of options.
[185:41.79]Those are four options.
[185:43.07]Are you saying their brains are too small to comprehend those four options?
[185:46.07]No, I'm saying that there's so many people around writing so many different things.
[185:49.53]We're getting fishing, fishing, fishing, fishing, fishing, fishing.
[185:54.61]Here's the door.
[185:55.31]There's the truck with the door right there.
[185:56.86]Truck with the door.
[185:57.56]All right.
[186:04.33]No, I'm too far.
[186:13.43]Because I jumped out.
[186:14.23]I'm coming.
[186:14.91]I'm fine.
[186:19.04]Okay, we got fishing or helicopter door.
[186:21.70]And we got... We have an option here to do plane door.
[186:27.04]Right?
[186:27.58]Because plane door would work too.
[186:30.74]Why are you so far back there?
[186:31.92]Because I jumped out.
[186:36.65]We're seeing bicycles in this game.
[186:37.99]All right, I'll catch up with you with the plane.
[186:41.72]Just you get down there and you pursue.
[186:44.08]I'll catch up to you in the plane.
[186:45.96]I'm not going to fly.
[186:46.70]I'm going to drive it.
[186:47.22]They just called in reinforcements.
[186:48.92]Well, I'll just... We'll be fine.
[186:53.10]Do not kill innocent people.
[186:54.90]I didn't.
[186:55.30]All right, here I'm coming.
[187:00.16]Well...
[187:03.39]No, no, no, no, no.
[187:05.49]Okay, okay.
[187:06.45]Sorry, sorry.
[187:07.73]I didn't realize it goes this fast this quickly.
[187:09.93]I don't know how to drive the plane though.
[187:10.95]Okay, decelerate.
[187:16.25]Okay, I'm fine.
[187:16.65]All right, let me help these people out real quick.
[187:19.30]Yeah, I'm gonna land it.
[187:20.08]Actually, I don't want to help because this guy's about to RPG you.
[187:22.92]What do you mean?
[187:24.52]I mean, he's aiming at you with the RPG.
[187:30.53]Okay, I just bounced.
[187:33.22]The plane's made out of rubber.
[187:35.50]I gotta land this before I... I gotta land all the way back here, man.
[187:48.29]Okay.
[187:51.45]I can't be trusted with this, honestly.
[187:54.29]So I'm gonna go ahead and get out.
[188:01.23]How you doing over there?
[188:02.55]Good.
[188:03.03]How are you?
[188:15.83]Good.
[188:19.37]Well, now we don't have a plane.
[188:20.87]I think you're misunderstanding.
[188:25.19]We just, you just got rid of a plane.
[188:27.65]Well, there's plenty of planes.
[188:34.98]That didn't even kill me.
[188:36.46]You moved into it.
[188:37.70]I was trying to get it.
[188:38.36]I was trying to catch it.
[188:42.12]Really?
[188:49.20]How are we going to get a plane?
[188:50.06]We need a plane, man.
[188:50.96]Why do we need a plane?
[188:52.08]Because we've already done all the funny plane things.
[188:54.06]But we had an opportunity to drive the plane into the door and try to get that to work.
[188:57.54]The helicopter is way better, though.
[188:59.08]But how do you know?
[188:59.64]And it's been proven.
[189:00.32]We've got a bear!
[189:03.48]Who?
[189:05.89]oh wait come over here don't no no don't don't don't try to get him to attack the barrel I don't I don't think bear claws can can set off explode he's not dead he's fine did you do I just yeah he's coming after you that bear could not be killed by an explosion I mean he's dead now
[189:36.65]The fire ultimately killed him.
[189:38.81]Now the building's on fire.
[189:40.23]Anything in here?
[189:42.31]There's a register.
[189:49.18]I like how we're supposed to be the good guys.
[189:52.24]This room is now in fail fish only mode.
[189:55.96]Get out of here.
[190:04.92]This thing sucks.
[190:15.31]Hey, dude!
[190:16.37]Do this!
[190:21.29]What?
[190:23.15]What is going on?
[190:25.51]Why is there... Watch out!
[190:30.89]You really showed that... Well, no you didn't.
[190:33.11]Honey badgers are tough.
[190:35.17]You think that's going to be good enough?
[190:36.61]Why is he still chasing me?
[190:37.59]Alright, I'm going to go on the rock.
[190:38.51]He can't go up here.
[190:40.84]You refused to shoot a honey badger.
[190:42.52]He can't get us on the rock.
[190:48.79]He wants to come up here on the rock.
[190:50.01]Yeah, I told you.
[190:50.55]Actually true.
[190:52.65]Now he's giving up.
[190:54.41]He's like, fine!
[190:56.29]Don't piss him off.
[190:59.14]See?
[190:59.86]We don't even exist anymore.
[191:07.13]What are we doing?
[191:08.89]Who are these guys?
[191:16.46]Did he just yell, I'm dead?
[191:18.64]Yes, he did.
[191:22.28]Where did his body go?
[191:24.36]I don't know.
[191:26.46]No one exists here anymore.
[191:27.92]They've been consumed by fire.
[191:30.70]I think that's somebody's hand.
[191:31.45]Down there.
[191:33.11]There's our target.
[191:34.91]Okay, here they come.
[191:35.93]More.
[191:39.65]Where are they?
[191:40.09]Here you go.
[191:42.43]Okay.
[191:42.93]No, here they go.
[191:43.81]No.
[191:45.90]Take the bear skin.
[191:46.62]You can at least sell it.
[191:47.66]Yeah.
[191:47.94]Even if it's damaged.
[191:51.62]To be fair, if you go up to a damaged vehicle, it does prompt you to hit E. Yes, it does.
[191:57.30]And now I'm on fire.
[191:59.08]Put it out, please.
[192:01.66]Okay.
[192:05.61]I just prepared that.
[192:06.75]How?
[192:07.55]Okay.
[192:07.87]Can we just get anything going here?
[192:10.13]Okay.
[192:11.11]I just heard an eagle crow.
[192:11.87]I gave Chad a choice.
[192:12.83]I heard an eagle go, crow.
[192:20.74]They didn't do anything to stop that.
[192:25.55]Another, like, World War II... Plane?
[192:29.65]There's a... There's a Mack truck for some reason.
[192:33.09]I'll take care of this guy.
[192:36.99]Okay, we're getting the Mack truck.
[192:39.22]I'll take the... The Mack truck is boring.
[192:40.90]Just wait a minute.
[192:41.46]Wait for that guy to do another pass, and I'm gonna stuff.
[192:44.54]There's one situation in which maybe it's not, though.
[192:52.94]He dodged it!
[192:54.62]How would you dodge it that well?
[192:58.03]Wow.
[192:59.25]He actually tried.
[193:00.07]He dodged it.
[193:12.89]Did he do that or did you do that?
[193:14.19]That was not me.
[193:16.35]This guy's really testing my fucking patience right now.
[193:19.25]He blew up the vehicle I wanted.
[193:21.41]He...
[193:26.43]You having some problems?
[193:27.45]Just get me up.
[193:28.55]I'm trying.
[193:29.37]I'm being attacked by a World War II era airplane.
[193:31.85]Thank you.
[193:34.89]This guy.
[193:35.52]And a 50 cal machine gunner behind us.
[193:37.38]Oh my... I'm dead again.
[193:45.50]Oh, are you?
[193:47.20]You died... The second time.
[193:49.61]I thought I was going to do it.
[193:51.57]I thought I was going to do it.
[193:52.25]I'm getting out of the way.
[193:57.98]Let's go.
[193:58.74]Out.
[193:59.24]Out of here.
[194:04.43]Get in the truck.
[194:07.39]Give us a story mission to do.
[194:12.01]What did Chad want to do?
[194:14.91]We already ruined what they wanted to do.
[194:17.23]What did they want to do?
[194:18.59]It was truck.
[194:19.37]Plane truck thing.
[194:20.68]Well, we can still do the truck.
[194:21.96]There's a turn around.
[194:23.76]Go backwards.
[194:25.32]We've still got part one of that puzzle.
[194:27.24]Well, we need an airplane if you want to do it.
[194:28.66]Go that way.
[194:29.06]Yeah, but that's the easy part.
[194:30.66]The truck's the hard part.
[194:31.92]All right.
[194:32.44]Let's do a story mission.
[194:34.44]No, we got the truck.
[194:35.26]They want to do the truck.
[194:36.04]Then let's do the truck.
[194:36.92]Take a left at the next road.
[194:43.55]They weren't there before.
[194:45.31]Never mind.
[194:46.15]There was a truck under the sign to your right.
[194:47.69]It's despawned.
[194:50.85]We want fishing.
[194:51.75]We want fishing.
[194:54.43]You want us to collectively lose like 700 people?
[194:57.77]It's called go fishing again.
[195:04.11]Mostly you.
[195:05.99]What happened now?
[195:07.53]Is this a pig chasing after this guy?
[195:10.53]Oh no, it's going to blow up on these cows.
[195:14.69]Are you also dead?
[195:16.87]Okay, what the fuck?
[195:19.21]We can't do anything.
[195:23.15]Okay, let's fish.
[195:24.14]You're in a bit of a pickle.
[195:25.18]Let's fish.
[195:25.50]No, let's go ahead and fish.
[195:26.14]Let's fish.
[195:26.70]Catch one fish, and then we're going to do a mission.
[195:34.66]Fine.
[195:34.84]Okay, let's find the toughest fishing spot we can.
[195:36.74]Let's find a really, really good fishing spot.
[195:43.94]the hell is this dude okay we've got uh we got a dock over here with a boat shop dude there's like a there's a fast and furious joke here can we just get like five seconds I can't even stop dying we seriously like can we have like kill someone no I didn't do it it's just the ai director just spawns a hundred people
[196:10.93]I'm literally looking at my menu and we get spawned like 500 infected.
[196:19.84]I was trying to find us a fishing spot.
[196:21.92]Alright, just, you know, put your hands in your pockets.
[196:26.35]No, we have to, you have to like move.
[196:27.55]Don't talk to anybody.
[196:29.55]Don't tell anybody.
[196:30.53]I'm telling, look, the AI director is starting to spawn people on us now.
[196:34.09]Like, we gotta get out of here.
[196:35.29]See, already.
[196:35.93]It's already happened.
[196:37.05]Deja vu, man.
[196:37.86]AI director.
[196:42.13]You just murdered some civilians.
[196:43.83]We just got to get out of here.
[196:44.75]This is the spot.
[196:49.80]We don't have time to pick flowers.
[196:51.98]It was a quest.
[196:55.34]Plus, I set us a way.
[196:56.46]Is that you?
[196:58.76]No.
[196:59.26]Who is that?
[197:03.41]Okay.
[197:04.05]We have to get out of here now.
[197:06.87]Look at...
[197:10.59]It doesn't make any sense.
[197:11.81]We have to get out of here.
[197:13.25]Just get in this guy's car.
[197:14.67]Who fucking cares?
[197:17.13]Get us out of here, civilian.
[197:19.09]Oh my god.
[197:21.38]Fucking asshole.
[197:22.72]Go!
[197:28.10]He's hyperventilating.
[197:29.06]Okay, I'm on the road.
[197:32.60]Good.
[197:33.14]We're going.
[197:34.90]I gotta get you to the hospital so you can get your, like, breathalyzer.
[197:39.35]We're fine.
[197:49.47]Here's a plane.
[197:50.61]This is the fishing spot.
[197:51.69]Oh, fishing spot.
[197:52.95]Okay.
[197:54.33]Found it.
[197:57.70]There's also a boat spawn over here.
[198:00.66]Okay, catch one fish and then we're taking the plane out of here and we're going to do a mission.
[198:08.08]I don't have my fishing rod with me.
[198:09.72]Just get one.
[198:10.80]I'll get one.
[198:11.35]Look.
[198:11.71]Watch this.
[198:12.37]This is fun.
[198:13.71]How do you pull the fishing rod out again?
[198:15.21]Why?
[198:16.29]Why do I not have a fishing rod?
[198:17.99]I don't know.
[198:18.31]Just get it as fast as you can.
[198:25.50]Got it.
[198:26.12]Rainbow trout.
[198:26.68]Cool.
[198:27.08]How much does it weigh?
[198:29.00]12 pounds.
[198:29.30]All right.
[198:29.96]Get in the plane.
[198:30.74]That's it.
[198:31.96]Got my fish.
[198:32.52]Wow.
[198:32.78]They're going to be really upset with you.
[198:37.61]You want to get in?
[198:39.57]Hold on.
[198:41.87]I have enough money to do the thing I wanted to do earlier now.
[198:44.49]What do you want to do earlier?
[198:45.15]Uh, we have to get to a gun shop.
[198:47.63]It's probably not even worth it, but... Let's do a story mission.
[198:55.73]More fishing.
[198:56.35]No, I already did fishing.
[199:00.45]Now give me a waypoint.
[199:03.27]Okay, you want to do like a main story mission?
[199:05.39]Yeah, let's do like a main story mission.
[199:09.18]Do you want to do a plane mission?
[199:11.30]A main story mission.
[199:12.06]We're going to ditch this plane and land on the... This is also... It has the same icon as a story mission, but it says plane.
[199:18.38]So do you want to do a plane story mission?
[199:20.79]I guess so, yeah.
[199:21.49]Just put it on the map.
[199:22.21]There's three different ones.
[199:23.75]Whatever one is the closest one.
[199:25.09]I guess this one over here.
[199:27.89]So do we need to keep the plane or are we going to get a plane?
[199:30.42]I think we're going to get a plane.
[199:31.52]But I have a feeling it's going to end up being the thing like last time where there's only one plane.
[199:35.52]Well, that's fine.
[199:36.59]And co-op person gets a nice scenic view.
[199:39.35]Do the main fishing mission.
[199:40.93]All right.
[199:43.16]I'm going to this one.
[199:43.88]This one you're talking about right here.
[199:45.70]All right.
[199:46.04]There's a runway.
[199:46.66]I'll take care of this.
[200:04.02]A little rough, but it's okay.
[200:10.04]Slow.
[200:10.54]Stop.
[200:11.04]Stop.
[200:12.04]Perfect.
[200:12.82]Perfect landing.
[200:13.48]I'm honestly surprised.
[200:14.60]I was waiting for the full speed ahead.
[200:17.98]Who?
[200:20.30]Who?
[200:21.42]Is nowhere sacred?
[200:22.70]Air raid.
[200:24.66]You want to get in the other one?
[200:29.85]Oh, God.
[200:30.73]I can't get out now.
[200:33.51]Yeah, and there's a plane dead ahead.
[200:35.07]Can't even fucking fly forward.
[200:36.91]Well, we got enemies behind us, so you gotta go forward.
[200:39.05]They're shooting the plane.
[200:45.98]Oh my god.
[200:46.44]We're already smoked.
[200:48.34]Why is gravity reversed?
[200:54.69]Gravity was reversed.
[200:56.27]I was flying upwards.
[200:57.57]I took off my glasses for the first time.
[200:59.29]I don't even wear glasses.
[201:03.21]Why were the people spawned behind us?
[201:05.71]Alright, I like this game.
[201:07.23]It's getting really funny and really fun.
[201:08.99]But man!
[201:10.47]What is with the people spawning?
[201:12.74]But seriously.
[201:15.72]Why was there a fucking tanker with five people that creeped up on us?
[201:20.36]Creeped us up.
[201:21.44]You know what I'm trying to say.
[201:22.56]Creeped up there.
[201:24.00]Right behind us.
[201:25.12]It's just like, why?
[201:27.52]The spawn rate just seems like it's turned up to like fucking 50.
[201:33.10]Just be glad we played on normal.
[201:34.46]Look out behind you!
[201:35.14]There's a fucking bunch of people that rolled up!
[201:38.05]We have a bug on us.
[201:38.97]They have a tracking device.
[201:40.03]Graves us, son.
[201:46.31]And I can't even do anything.
[201:51.37]I can't even get... Fucking guy.
[201:54.45]I didn't do anything.
[201:55.99]Did you just jump out?
[201:57.01]Yeah, you did.
[201:58.21]But you don't understand.
[202:07.44]Did I get you?
[202:08.52]No, you came so close.
[202:11.18]I'm just gonna go over here.
[202:12.12]I'm just gonna spawn on you.
[202:15.40]That was the... Okay, you remember when we did the first mission in the plane, the story mission, and I couldn't fucking do anything?
[202:19.71]I couldn't even move?
[202:20.35]Mm-hmm.
[202:21.37]I was just seeing what happened, and I could get out on this one.
[202:25.63]I couldn't get out last time, for some reason.
[202:28.83]Yeah, I neither could I. I was just seeing what was gonna happen.
[202:37.12]So are you spectating?
[202:38.56]I am about to spawn in the plane.
[202:40.70]I'm fine.
[202:42.18]But the thing is, I can't do anything.
[202:47.70]That is the thing.
[202:48.46]That is why we're not going to do the plane story mission anymore.
[202:50.96]How about you calm down with a little fishing?
[202:54.06]Good work.
[202:57.41]She's excited.
[202:58.15]Why don't you get excited?
[203:01.37]I need some, I need some, like, moral support here, you know?
[203:04.10]Story equals resident sleeper.
[203:06.30]Fishing equals pogchamp.
[203:08.90]No.
[203:11.48]I mean, it is true you would be doing more if you were fishing right now.
[203:14.46]I mean, right now I would be.
[203:16.50]Me, personally.
[203:17.10]I don't know why this convoy is a thousand meters away, but I'm just gonna fly in between the trees.
[203:25.91]Um, okay.
[203:29.22]Seems to be working quite well for us.
[203:32.54]No, it's not, but you're alright.
[203:34.13]You can straighten it out.
[203:36.97]We're almost there, chat.
[203:38.41]It's almost like the plane was alive.
[203:41.55]Do you see me turned around looking at you?
[203:43.51]I can see you looking the other direction.
[203:47.76]Looks like you're not paying attention to the plane.
[203:53.40]I get that last convoy.
[203:59.07]Hey, why don't you do something back there?
[204:00.53]I would love to.
[204:02.78]One more.
[204:03.42]Like, there's a bunch of people shooting me.
[204:05.74]I can't even take out a gun.
[204:07.60]I just get to watch from behind her.
[204:09.22]It's weird they don't give you the kind of gun that has the guys in the back.
[204:12.05]Yeah.
[204:12.37]Oh, well.
[204:16.99]Go a little bit more.
[204:18.37]You got it.
[204:19.59]One more truck.
[204:21.37]I could probably have an issue.
[204:22.71]I might be able to jump out.
[204:24.09]You want to get out?
[204:25.73]You want to kill that?
[204:27.49]Oh, boy.
[204:27.83]You really did want to get out.
[204:33.99]Okay.
[204:34.40]The plane was dead.
[204:35.76]Yep.
[204:36.60]They killed it.
[204:40.70]Really?
[204:42.24]Oh, yeah.
[204:42.64]Just come back 1,500 meters.
[204:45.78]Just walk here.
[204:46.70]God damn it.
[204:48.78]I'm gonna try to shoot it with a rocket.
[204:53.73]Fuck.
[204:54.25]We need something.
[204:56.03]Yeah, we gotta get something.
[204:57.21]There's another plane in the sky.
[205:00.19]There was only one vehicle left.
[205:02.63]Is that Diana?
[205:04.77]How is Diana up?
[205:10.43]Is that why Diana's in a plane?
[205:11.95]No, she's just like, her body is over here.
[205:15.38]I don't have any more bullets.
[205:19.85]All right, here we go.
[205:22.93]Car?
[205:23.99]Yep.
[205:28.43]I got one, too.
[205:29.96]Let's move.
[205:31.16]Okay, well, then we'll just do it that way.
[205:33.00]Where's the convoy?
[205:34.70]Convoy's, like, to the right.
[205:37.24]Yeah, we gotta do this.
[205:40.82]Whoa.
[205:41.86]Explosions.
[205:42.99]Now, we're gonna have to kill them with pistol only.
[205:46.20]Because we're each going to have to drive.
[205:52.09]What's with the crabs?
[205:53.23]No, not in the game.
[205:53.93]There's a bunch of crabs in my chat.
[205:59.31]Why am I getting raided from your stream?
[206:02.45]I don't know.
[206:03.67]They do whatever they want to do.
[206:05.61]We're both in the same game, doing the same... I didn't do anything.
[206:13.59]Now he noticed us.
[206:15.23]Slow-moed hurts is what I'm reading.
[206:16.75]Apparently they were spamming you with grabs.
[206:21.23]Yeah, I'm getting grabbed.
[206:26.22]You didn't even get that guy.
[206:27.22]Sorry, I got him for you.
[206:31.62]We'll go raid italics with rats now.
[206:34.36]Oh no.
[206:37.18]Yeah, I didn't say it.
[206:38.99]You just said it!
[206:40.05]I didn't... I was reading it.
[206:41.11]I didn't say it.
[206:41.74]You read it as a statement.
[206:43.08]But I didn't say that.
[206:44.26]I was reading it.
[206:46.62]I may have read it out loud, but... Really?
[206:49.50]I mean, I got the convoy.
[206:51.82]Just stay alive.
[206:53.50]Or pick me up.
[206:54.96]I'm gonna get you.
[206:58.63]There's more helicopters to get.
[207:00.29]Now we have to get helicopters.
[207:02.45]This is gonna be great.
[207:03.19]Yeah, I hear the... It is crabs versus rats right now, and I think the rats are gonna be winning.
[207:08.19]I'm dead.
[207:11.16]You gotta come get me now.
[207:17.10]Okay, we get to destroy helicopters now?
[207:21.56]But it wants us to enter Nick's plane.
[207:24.34]They're dropping a bomb.
[207:26.60]Can I fast travel?
[207:29.00]You just got hit directly by that.
[207:33.10]Wait, it's this guy.
[207:34.28]Wait, wait, don't shoot this guy.
[207:37.46]Let this guy mortar us.
[207:40.28]I wonder if he'll do it.
[207:42.04]Just play along with this guy.
[207:43.06]Maybe he'll mortar this spot right here and kill himself.
[207:50.34]No, let him do it.
[207:51.14]He has to do it.
[207:53.39]This is my first time picking up the mortar.
[207:54.95]I don't think it's physically possible.
[207:57.31]He's shooting me over and over.
[208:00.41]Get off that thing!
[208:04.03]You can't mortar your own position.
[208:05.68]Why?
[208:05.98]I would move.
[208:11.77]He's very aggressive in PC right now.
[208:14.23]Where did this guy come from?
[208:17.12]We have a friend who's trying to kill you.
[208:20.32]I shot the guy on the bike.
[208:21.74]He was aiming at you.
[208:26.95]Is he going to go away?
[208:38.36]I only see crabs right now.
[208:40.00]You only see crabs?
[208:42.37]Yeah, they are claiming victory right now.
[208:46.91]Are you fucking serious, guys?
[208:50.17]The italics crabs are going to win?
[208:53.18]You're going to let that happen?
[208:55.18]In the middle of a stream?
[208:56.56]You're going to let this happen?
[208:57.58]They're calling for a ceasefire.
[208:59.60]Unbelievable.
[209:00.38]Alright, let's go destroy the helicopters.
[209:04.56]Yeah, we have to drive like 2,000 meters to get back to the airplane.
[209:07.92]Oh, my God.
[209:09.02]I want to try to fast travel there.
[209:10.80]We can't.
[209:12.06]I bet we can't.
[209:12.66]There's probably a way.
[209:16.26]I mean, we're good like this.
[209:20.03]Don't make any dumb movements.
[209:22.33]We're just going.
[209:25.81]Oh.
[209:26.11]2,000 meters?
[209:26.61]Like, come on.
[209:27.03]That was going to be like a five-minute trek.
[209:29.21]Yeah, but who knows?
[209:29.69]We may have been able to... Yeah, you're right.
[209:34.94]Yeah, that's right.
[209:39.94]Okay.
[209:41.48]New airplane.
[209:44.95]Where is the new airplane?
[209:46.13]I don't know.
[209:47.89]Do you have any idea where the new airplane is?
[209:49.85]Oh.
[209:50.23]How about over here?
[209:52.11]Can we open the hangar or something?
[210:07.15]I have my plane.
[210:09.12]There it is.
[210:12.94]Do you have a plane?
[210:14.28]I bought a plane a long time ago.
[210:17.10]Is it a good plane?
[210:19.46]You get one?
[210:21.44]I get one?
[210:22.58]I'm going to fly behind you.
[210:24.68]If I can't do anything, then I want to at least get a fun view.
[210:30.13]Oh, I guess I do have a plane.
[210:32.25]No, I don't want to buy it.
[210:35.34]This thing doesn't have any weapons.
[210:36.22]Oh, I have this plane.
[210:37.20]Here we go.
[210:37.62]This is it.
[210:38.40]Can you move out of the way?
[210:40.98]I got a plane that solves this problem.
[210:42.74]Okay.
[210:43.02]You got a plane that solves the problem.
[210:47.36]I got the story plane.
[210:48.50]So you got the story plane.
[210:49.40]So why did I buy the shitty plane?
[210:50.78]What was the point of this?
[210:52.92]Did you just buy it?
[210:53.48]I bought this like four hours ago.
[210:55.94]Well, this is the fancy plane that we were flying in with the yes sign.
[210:59.34]All right.
[210:59.54]Well, I'm already in this.
[211:00.30]I'm taking off.
[211:02.76]I'm gonna head there.
[211:03.42]This is the one with the backseat gunner.
[211:05.08]But we need to do a thing where we fly together, you know what I'm saying?
[211:07.56]I'm gonna slow down a little.
[211:08.46]We need to fly together.
[211:10.64]Like the Mighty Ducks.
[211:14.76]That was the first thing that... You really are living in the 90s.
[211:17.78]Where are you?
[211:20.10]You in the air?
[211:20.40]I'm right behind you.
[211:21.06]You're right behind me.
[211:21.64]Alright, so I'm gonna slow down just a little bit.
[211:25.87]Just try not to pass me.
[211:26.89]Get right next to me.
[211:30.61]You're below me, okay.
[211:34.09]Oh, Jesus!
[211:36.55]Okay, save right next to me.
[211:39.25]We have... Alright, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[211:40.91]Slow down.
[211:44.26]Hey, look who it is!
[211:46.56]It's my wingman!
[211:49.94]I'm gonna slow down a little.
[211:52.72]I mean, I understand what you just tried to do, but it didn't really work.
[211:55.82]No, I did what I... I did exactly what I tried to do.
[211:57.94]Alright, so we gotta go get the helicopters.
[212:01.20]There's a helicopter right here.
[212:02.12]I'm going to go for a secret technique here, I think.
[212:08.41]Oh, you're not going to... Let me do my secret technique.
[212:10.31]Okay, listen.
[212:11.21]That was a great shot, and I will not be chastised.
[212:14.03]Just watch this and just tell me how this looks.
[212:16.51]Because this is a pretty interesting technique.
[212:19.51]It should work out pretty well.
[212:24.32]It didn't.
[212:27.54]Oh, well.
[212:29.50]I was trying to just get rid of him, and then spawn on you.
[212:31.82]Why is he faster than me?
[212:36.58]Was that the secret technique you were attempting?
[212:38.96]No.
[212:40.04]I don't have a gun!
[212:41.60]I didn't shoot him, I just rammed him to death.
[212:43.88]Oh.
[212:44.22]Well, he already had 10%- That was an enemy plane.
[212:53.30]And I get the epic dogfight music, too, for this mission.
[212:58.25]And you're just dead.
[213:01.41]I'm giving you some time.
[213:05.69]So you can participate in this.
[213:07.39]Yeah, I can't wait to participate.
[213:17.33]Very pretty what you guys are doing, though.
[213:20.59]Are you spawned yet?
[213:21.55]I am spawned now.
[213:23.00]And I actually get the gun this time.
[213:24.84]I know, that's what I was trying to tell you.
[213:25.98]Can you shoot him?
[213:27.92]Not when he's in front of you.
[213:31.53]I can only shoot at the back.
[213:32.97]The back portion.
[213:34.17]There we go.
[213:34.85]There's another plane?
[213:43.03]Alright, I gotta take action.
[213:44.61]I can't... Uh-oh, we're gonna have a problem here in a second.
[213:50.63]I'm smoking.
[213:51.17]I can't even... It's, like, impossible.
[213:58.58]That was a pretty epic finale there.
[214:02.21]Pretty epic finale.
[214:03.09]Did you die?
[214:05.41]I did, yeah.
[214:06.23]We exploded.
[214:07.29]Did you not see the plane go up and smoke?
[214:09.09]I don't know.
[214:09.37]Maybe you could have gotten away.
[214:10.61]Where's the checkpoint in this mission?
[214:12.83]How many times do you think they put this through playtesting?
[214:16.33]They had to make this... We did it.
[214:21.64]Really?
[214:22.26]You know why we did it?
[214:24.61]Because I exploded into the enemy plane, killed him, and it checkpointed at that moment.
[214:31.90]That's cool.
[214:37.08]Why is there a trail of blood leading up to this?
[214:39.00]Because we got DIY and DOA.
[214:43.11]You'll never get into my bunker.
[214:44.81]It's impregnable.
[214:45.63]I built it myself.
[214:48.47]Even if you do, you'll never get out again, is what it says.
[214:51.37]Okay.
[214:53.13]So, get in the bunker somehow.
[214:55.99]Yeah.
[214:57.81]Ceiling, maybe?
[214:59.57]No, nothing up here.
[215:02.57]We got an attachment there.
[215:05.55]There's a zip line.
[215:08.41]Hmm.
[215:09.59]I'm thinking explosives here.
[215:12.21]I'm thinking maybe an explosive.
[215:17.35]Step back.
[215:21.45]I was back.
[215:21.89]Okay, I blew the door open.
[215:24.65]Are you here?
[215:24.95]Okay.
[215:26.46]So I'm never going to get out again, apparently.
[215:27.88]Let's see what that means.
[215:30.14]Resist.
[215:33.72]Okay, get in.
[215:34.38]This place is huge.
[215:45.19]Keep out.
[215:46.99]I need power.
[215:50.06]I'm gonna assume all the way at the back.
[215:51.50]Is that you?
[215:58.57]Are you breaking stu- Is that you breaking stuff?
[216:03.75]Am I playing a horror game now?
[216:05.47]And you're the monster.
[216:13.79]Okay, that's... Let me investigate that.
[216:16.41]We got... I think we have a rigged up explosive or something here.
[216:23.23]Did you do it?
[216:24.07]No.
[216:24.63]I don't know.
[216:27.17]I hear like... Do it.
[216:31.01]How'd it go?
[216:32.65]Just like that.
[216:33.13]Okay, let's see what happens if I walk in this room.
[216:44.22]what um did you did you throw the trap lever uh apparently I did well you just walked right into the fire okay uh okay I don't understand what the this place is booby trapped that's why they said you can make it in but you can't where's the loot I don't know there was a door that was back here right oh watch out
[217:11.51]Oh, come on.
[217:12.27]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[217:15.13]Sprinklers.
[217:15.71]It's right here.
[217:17.34]This is the place to go.
[217:20.38]Can you open the door?
[217:23.42]Lots of stuff in here.
[217:24.54]Now we're talking.
[217:26.76]Nice.
[217:30.18]Big money.
[217:31.85]Weapons.
[217:32.21]Smoke grenades.
[217:32.63]Rockets.
[217:38.73]three perk points and perk magazine anything else what about yeah those weapons any good this is the same same sniper that we've
[217:50.37]Already got.
[217:50.95]All right, we got enough money to go.
[217:52.99]I want to go get the new toy.
[217:54.47]It's not even that cool, but I've just wanted to do it the whole time.
[217:57.13]It's not cool.
[217:58.05]What is it?
[217:58.41]I mean, it's, it's, it's like, okay.
[217:59.91]I'd give it like a, you know, like a middling grade.
[218:02.53]Okay.
[218:03.13]For potential.
[218:03.71]What is it?
[218:05.01]Like if, if helicopter plus clothes truck is like a potential, this is like a C potential.
[218:12.06]And it, yeah.
[218:13.48]Okay.
[218:13.86]Honest to God.
[218:17.16]What, what happened?
[218:17.80]There's just people just standing on it waiting for us.
[218:21.84]And I shot the rocket launcher because I was annoyed.
[218:24.98]Oh, so it's their fault?
[218:26.18]It's all their fault.
[218:31.07]I'm looking at your ugly mug when I pick you up.
[218:33.17]Why are these guys even here?
[218:34.07]Because we set the booby traps off.
[218:36.27]They were waiting for somebody to come, like, trap.
[218:38.57]That's horseshit.
[218:39.51]And get in.
[218:39.95]I want to see what's in here.
[218:48.85]It's a TV.
[218:50.13]You want to watch TV?
[218:55.97]We've already seen this cutscene.
[218:58.82]Somebody just got to this portion of the game that we're playing and got up and left to the bathroom or something.
[219:03.84]Didn't want to watch the cutscene.
[219:06.04]Alright, let's go to... Where is a gun shop?

[219:15.76]And how can I... Let's fast travel to this gun shop even though it's like on the wrong... Oh, this works.
[219:22.83]Because I have to get it from the gun shop.

[223:42.32]If you're reading this, and you're a bad guy, why are they called Peggy's again?
[223:47.99]Uh because they're- it's like the religious cult thing?
[223:51.00]If you're a resistance come on and see me in the elevator. I got some goodies you can use against the cultures. Watch your steps you come up I got a little friend who doesn't want to be disturbed.
[224:00.00]There's gonna be a bear in here or something.
[224:02.00]Yeah, there's gonna be like a bear. There's all these cages with people in them.
[224:05.00]Take out your shovel or something.
[224:08.00]The side of this container actually says meat wagon.
[224:13.00]You should take out your shovel.
[224:14.00]Or something nothing do nothing too dangerous.
[224:17.94]Like that rpg that you're gonna explode?
[224:19.00]I'm not- I'm not. Okay I gotta- we can break in here.
[224:23.00]Alright, be careful. I'm ready.
[224:24.50]There's bees.
[224:25.50]Bees?
[224:28.50]Uh what does that do?
[224:36.50]Okay yeah there are bees all over- I'm- we're dead here man.
[224:42.50]Uh- you can- you- can you get out of the way?
[224:44.71]You get out of the way.
[224:45.45]You're running up to the bees.
[224:46.47]I'm trying to run away from the bees.
[224:53.17]I'm bloody.
[224:56.31]All right.
[224:57.09]Bees.
[224:57.83]Enough.
[224:59.85]Just throw a grenade in that room.
[225:04.41]I think they're gone.
[225:05.25]Are they gone?
[225:07.29]I have to use a med kit, though.
[225:09.41]There's more.
[225:09.89]All right.
[225:10.43]We'll just find your way through this.
[225:13.33]I fell through a trap.
[225:14.65]You're dead.
[225:16.57]I think you were supposed to do that.
[225:18.30]Well, as long as you don't break the beehives, then the bees don't hurt you.
[225:24.44]So, you're fine as long as you don't break them.
[225:27.08]But you have to break them to get to the goods.
[225:29.28]I got an idea.
[225:30.61]Look over there.
[225:32.33]Oh, I see.
[225:32.69]Are you going to throw a torch?
[225:34.83]Did that actually just work?
[225:38.91]That actually just worked.
[225:39.95]Unbelievable.
[225:40.49]Alright, well, open it up.
[225:45.93]You want to help?
[225:47.13]I mean, I could.
[225:48.05]Okay, I got it.
[225:49.31]Don't worry.
[225:53.59]That's it.
[225:54.58]250 bucks?
[225:54.90]That's it?
[225:55.28]No, that's not it.
[225:56.58]There's 500.
[225:57.46]There's more in here.
[225:58.94]There were two stacks.
[225:59.98]Yeah, but there's definitely more in here.
[226:02.82]That can't be the only item or only thing to collect in here.
[226:05.06]I think we can break open this shit.
[226:15.80]I just want to see if it would burn, you know?
[226:17.76]Just checking.
[226:25.40]Oh, platform!
[226:26.54]Watch out for that beehive.
[226:31.11]This is the anti-bee device.
[226:32.71]It really is.
[226:38.11]I can't get over there while you're on it.
[226:39.27]How do you climb?
[226:41.29]Oh, never mind.
[226:43.89]Dumb question.

[228:52.55]What are you doing?
[228:53.69]I panicked.
[228:54.13]I had to do that, dude.
[228:54.95]He freaked out.
[228:56.03]He was killing me.
[228:56.93]I was asking what he was doing.
[229:03.42]I shot a guy down here and he got really angry and became hostile.
[229:08.66]That's the first time a friendly NPC has attacked his back.
[229:12.60]He freaked out, man.
[229:17.34]That was very ungraceful.
[229:24.07]That's all I did.
[229:26.14]I didn't shoot at him.
[229:26.82]All right, you ready to do rock and roll?
[229:41.77]Got you.
[229:42.07]That was a smoke grenade.
[229:43.71]Well, when you hear tick, tick, tick, tick, tick,
[229:47.77]Usually my mind thinks that you're going to blow up the whole rooster nest.
[229:51.65]So I freak out and I jump out and I still end up dying.
[229:54.81]I know, that's what makes it so funny.
[229:56.17]So come back down here and get me up and let's go do a, let's go do something.

[230:31.92]That helicopter was just not here.
[230:37.00]The thing just wasn't even here.

[232:56.26]Hold on.
[232:56.80]You have to go now.
[232:57.42]There are four planes.
[232:58.54]There are three planes.
[232:59.79]You need to get in this car now.
[233:03.05]The guy got us out of harm's way.
[233:05.07]I picked us up in the canopy of God's grace, of John Seed's grace, and I carried us to a depot very close to here.
[233:13.27]We'll be safe there.
[233:14.33]There were too many planes.
[233:15.85]We'll have allies.
[233:17.01]Okay.
[233:18.27]It didn't do shit.
[233:19.15]The plane followed us here.
[233:21.66]He doesn't know we're here yet.
[233:23.00]He does?
[233:24.02]No, he doesn't.
[233:24.56]He doesn't know.
[233:25.18]He hasn't seen us yet.
[233:27.34]Just stay low.
[233:28.34]Just stay cool.
[233:31.62]Now, be the bow guy.
[233:33.78]We're going to be the silent weapon guy for one mission.
[233:36.35]Are we going to do this for one mission?
[233:38.23]Yeah.
[233:38.73]You have a silenced gun, right?
[233:40.15]Hold on a second.
[233:41.21]Sorry.
[233:41.59]We got a problem here.
[233:42.67]The plane actually has seen us now.
[233:45.01]It's going to rain hell down here at the shop.
[233:48.15]Yeah, he's going to hit the target.
[233:52.20]Does he?
[233:52.49]Does he see us?
[233:54.23]Yes, he does.
[233:54.77]Where do you think the rock music's coming from?
[233:57.93]Okay, hold on.
[233:59.03]I'll take care of this.
[234:00.05]We're going to do weapons and then slingshot.
[234:01.71]Where is it?
[234:03.89]All the way down?
[234:05.27]What category is it?
[234:07.42]Melee?
[234:07.82]Where's the slingslot?
[234:08.92]Slingslot.
[234:12.02]Where is it?
[234:13.02]It's like on the special tab on the far right.
[234:17.52]Bows?
[234:18.80]I can't.
[234:19.76]It's locked.
[234:22.12]It's locked.
[234:23.14]Gain one level of resistance in any region to unlock this item.
[234:27.42]I don't think I'm allowed to get that item.
[234:31.66]Gain one level of resistance?
[234:34.22]I can buy it.
[234:35.17]Maybe I can drop it for you.
[234:39.49]Actually, you know what?
[234:40.27]I have the perfect solution for this.
[234:45.93]Okay.
[234:46.73]It'll be taken care of in a moment.
[234:50.07]Yeah, it's the same thing I did.
[234:51.80]I just missed.
[234:53.68]That's not what I'm talking about.
[234:55.26]Who dropped a bomb on us?
[234:56.72]He did.
[234:58.78]But I found a friend.
[235:02.54]I'm going to hit the target.
[235:08.86]Come on.
[235:09.02]That went right through the play.
[235:10.12]Get him.
[235:10.46]Got it.
[235:14.33]What happened there?
[235:15.13]Did he die?
[235:16.03]Nick right took him out.
[235:17.27]Now, I can't get this weapon.
[235:19.55]Alright, well, here, I'll drop it on the ground.
[235:26.21]You didn't drop it on the ground.
[235:28.01]You killed that guy.
[235:29.23]I gotta switch weapon first.
[235:30.89]I'm carrying an RPG.
[235:36.09]By the way, it is insanely difficult to use.
[235:38.29]Put it here.
[235:42.09]Alright.
[235:46.19]Got it.
[235:47.71]Infinite ammo?
[235:49.00]It is infinite ammo.
[235:51.08]Okay.
[235:51.42]And I don't even know if it's a one-shot kill.
[235:54.38]It may not be.
[235:56.40]Let's try it.
[235:56.90]Let's give it a go.
[235:57.98]Only using this, right?
[235:59.12]Doing a story mission?
[236:00.08]Only... Well, just only quiet weapons.
[236:03.22]Okay.
[236:06.51]I'm gonna put a silencer on my SMG.
[236:08.91]I mean, I have a silencer on my... I'm gonna take this.
[236:14.27]I'm gonna swap this... This is my rocket launcher.
[236:23.03]um am I gonna lose all the ammo that I have for this maybe so I have a silencer on my sniper rifle does that that counts right uh yeah as long as it is a quiet no alarm weapon all right we're gonna try and actually do this can I buy a hat or something for a second so I don't look like a total dickhead
[237:05.02]How much are these?
[237:15.58]Too much.
[237:20.95]Let's use these.
[237:23.13]No, jeans.
[237:28.73]Alright, let's go.
[237:30.99]Guy Fieri shirt.
[237:32.01]Alright, time for...
[237:37.16]silent weapons only okay so I got a bow I got this and you have a really cool cs go weapon I do this is my I bought this from the steam marketplace let's do it it was only thirteen hundred dollars great deal that's cheap give us a waypoint um
[238:04.49]Okay.
[238:05.43]I just can't guarantee what this... Is it a story mission?
[238:08.59]Let's just do... Let's do an outpost because we can guarantee that we can do, like, a takedown.
[238:16.39]It's on the way to a story mission.
[238:18.10]Okay.
[238:19.50]So we're not... We don't need to be silent to this thing.
[238:21.94]No, yeah, this is the thing we need to do.
[238:23.28]This is liberate an outpost.
[238:24.30]Liberate an outpost, be quiet.
[238:25.62]Yeah.
[238:26.94]Okay.
[238:27.32]Because we don't know.
[238:28.14]The story mission could be, like, a, you know, special vehicle or...
[238:33.44]Special weapon they want us to use.
[238:35.48]Outpost is going to be guaranteed.
[238:38.94]What about the guy that's flying around in a plane shooting machine guns?
[238:41.74]Okay, okay.
[238:42.36]Hang on.
[238:43.00]I'll take care of it.
[238:44.70]That's not silent.
[238:49.11]There we go.
[238:49.49]He's gone.
[238:49.83]We need to pull up to a high point.
[238:53.19]Okay.
[238:56.49]Wolves aren't dogs.
[238:57.65]You can run over wolves.
[238:58.69]It's fine.
[238:59.05]You wanted a high point.
[239:04.48]Got one right here.
[239:05.02]I mean, aren't they going to drive by us on the road?
[239:08.27]I mean, as long as we just be quiet.
[239:09.97]Maybe we'll just blend in with the upside down, like, rotting people under the billboard.
[239:15.61]Maybe.
[239:15.79]I mean, this is silent, man.
[239:19.87]Yeah, this is pretty silent.
[239:21.39]This is pretty quiet.
[239:22.12]Just don't accidentally jump.
[239:23.50]I'm not going to jump, but I mean, I got a sniper.
[239:25.42]You want to just start picking people off?
[239:28.46]Hold on.
[239:30.04]I got to go in close before you start.
[239:31.58]Because if they see a body, they're going to raise the alarm.
[239:33.93]That's true.
[239:35.55]Also, there's a lot more people to tag.
[239:37.81]You be careful, though.
[239:39.03]There's an animal below us?
[239:40.93]There's an animal below us.
[239:42.97]I heard it growl.
[239:45.49]The animals can't use stairs or ladders.
[239:48.62]Here's what you're going to do.
[239:51.46]You're going to go... That's Boomer.
[239:52.68]Boomer is here.
[239:54.08]Oh, yeah.
[239:54.48]He's the animal.
[239:55.88]That's true.
[239:57.26]Are you ready?
[239:58.18]I'm ready.
[239:59.12]Don't do anything unless they see me.
[240:00.76]I'm not going to do anything.
[240:02.40]You can actually make it all the way here and have this water tower as your vantage point if you want.
[240:07.24]I like this place.
[240:08.20]I like being up here.
[240:08.83]I can see pretty much everything.
[240:10.87]So you tell me who you're going to go for, and we'll try and do it at the same time.
[240:17.17]I'm going to go... Guy with the warlock staff?
[240:19.97]I'm going to go around the side.
[240:23.75]Boomer is kind of doing his own thing.
[240:27.25]Boomer's just running in.
[240:29.12]Boomer is about to cause a massive problem for this stealth mission.
[240:34.82]No, he's not.
[240:35.28]He's good.
[240:36.24]He just ran around.
[240:39.36]I almost got spotted.
[240:40.80]All right.
[240:41.08]You want me to shoot that guy on the top?
[240:42.64]Hold on.
[240:43.32]Hold on.
[240:45.75]I can't see anybody that's over there.
[240:47.09]That guy's coming down the ladder.
[240:48.07]The guy on the roof?
[240:49.49]Get the guy on the roof, like... Big, high up roof.
[240:52.59]All the way up.
[240:53.11]The high up roof with the eyeball on top.
[240:55.05]He's the overwatch.
[240:56.61]He's done.
[240:56.89]Alright, I'm going into the warehouse.
[240:59.75]And he fell right in front of somebody.
[241:03.08]Oh my god.
[241:04.08]I gotta kill that person now.
[241:11.70]Okay.
[241:12.32]That was such bullshit.
[241:14.40]They're all running around now.
[241:17.32]That guy ran into something and died.
[241:18.92]How did that guy die?
[241:20.64]I shot him in the back.
[241:25.04]I can't even shoot now.
[241:33.09]I thought he hit his head on this thing.
[241:35.27]Oh my god.
[241:35.91]Hi, you're dead.
[241:39.31]Where's this guy going?
[241:41.06]That's a cougar.
[241:43.02]Come on, Boomer.
[241:44.14]Damn it!
[241:46.95]What happened to me?!
[241:47.85]I swear to God, man.
[241:49.57]You were smokebombed.
[241:54.06]That all went to shit because the guy fell in front.
[241:57.28]You have a cougar running around.
[241:58.46]Yeah, I know there's a cougar running around.
[242:01.48]I don't know how he got free.
[242:03.33]But they didn't set the alarm off, so we got that going for us at least.
[242:06.27]Guy fell off, slumped up the... What are you doing up here?
[242:12.51]Hey, you're the only one that got seen, so they, like, came to you.
[242:16.17]Hey, it still worked out nicely.
[242:18.33]Apparently we won.
[242:23.56]Get that American flag.
[242:24.40]Put that hand over your heart.
[242:27.74]Get that 50 cal.
[242:29.22]Wreck.
[242:35.36]Awful aim.
[242:38.34]Well, what do you want me to do?
[242:40.78]We got a $400 no alarm bonus, so that's still a win.
[242:44.12]Shit sways around.
[242:45.07]Had to do it stylized.
[242:46.29]Is there a loot here?
[242:47.03]I need ammo.
[243:06.07]Is this important dialogue?
[243:07.15]I'm sorry.
[243:07.61]That was not even necessary.
[243:11.29]What is happening?
[243:12.01]There was a bald eagle attacking.
[243:14.95]Oh, I see him.
[243:37.41]It's more fun to watch them.
[243:39.49]Oh, and the airplane.
[243:43.25]How much bullet drop is there actually in this game?
[243:45.55]I haven't even figured that out yet.
[243:47.86]Is there?
[243:50.98]Should I not be trying to lead targets?
[243:54.56]Bullet travel time is not the same as bullet drop.
[243:57.04]Is there travel time?
[243:58.83]I haven't even figured that out.
[244:00.59]There is travel time, but there's not as much drop.
[244:02.69]Not very much.
[244:03.25]Okay.
[244:08.35]So what do you want to do from here?
[244:11.77]There is a story mission.
[244:16.11]If you want to do a full fledged story mission.
[244:18.87]What are they looking at?
[244:19.43]They're probably looking at you.
[244:28.59]Aren't you just like sitting up there?
[244:30.74]I've been hydrating, I'm fine.
[244:31.98]Are you defending yourself against me?
[244:37.51]This is a guy down there and don't even he's freaking out Like I don't even know the hell this guy's doing He's gonna die from the cougar anyways don't even matter why did I just rescue him from the cougar don't ask me Wow what a good heart.
[244:57.35]This guy has like a thousand fucking HP
[245:04.34]I headshot him on the fucking ground.
[245:06.84]Who died?
[245:07.38]Did I get them both?
[245:10.36]I got them both.
[245:11.34]They died together.
[245:21.59]Well.
[245:26.03]That's one way to die.
[245:26.81]Oops, I thought I was muted.
[245:31.70]No, I'm not.
[245:32.46]What are you doing over there?
[245:33.77]I don't know.
[245:34.41]I got a headshot collateral.
[245:36.45]You'll see.
[245:36.81]Oh, cougar skin.
[245:41.40]I shot through the cougar's head and into his head.
[245:46.77]Is he eating them?
[245:47.57]Okay.
[245:50.35]All right.
[245:52.03]I'm ready to do something.
[245:54.19]What would you like to do?
[245:55.69]Didn't you say you wanted to do a story mission?
[245:57.61]A story mission.
[245:58.57]That'd be fun.
[245:59.03]Like a full-fledged campaign co-op story mission.
[246:02.79]Yes.
[246:04.31]Let me refill ammo.
[246:13.42]All right.
[246:15.06]Campaign story cooperative campaign mission.
[246:20.45]And then we'll see what time is it right now.
[246:22.67]We got time.
[246:23.47]Alright, let's do it.
[246:25.59]Does this have the capacity to knock anyone out?
[246:28.09]Probably.
[246:30.45]Then why is he not?
[246:33.83]Maybe it takes a while.
[246:36.24]It is just a slingshot.
[246:37.80]You're shooting rocks.
[246:39.38]Yeah, but I'm shooting rocks at someone's skull.
[246:43.68]I'm going to get out of the car.
[246:45.80]Head over this way if you have the opportunity, please.
[246:47.90]Where is the...
[246:50.53]Head over this way.
[246:51.45]I don't understand shooting in this game.
[246:59.32]From long distances.
[247:02.41]The bullet raised his face.
[247:16.83]Worst aim.
[247:18.05]It's actually fairly difficult to hit a shot from that far away.
[247:20.97]I want to do a test here.
[247:26.34]Let's see.
[247:32.42]I'm all the way back here.
[247:36.42]Let's try to shoot this tree.
[247:44.80]Okay, so I'm just trying to shoot the center of that tree and it just went to the right.
[247:47.82]See?
[247:50.69]Alright, you see what I'm talking about?
[247:52.93]What the fuck are you doing?
[247:55.01]I'm not shooting at you.
[247:55.83]Don't shoot at me.
[247:57.31]Really?
[247:58.55]Are you gonna be that much of a psycho about it?
[248:01.35]Why are these pumpkins?
[248:04.52]Yeah, it's not even hitting the tree.
[248:08.58]Alright, let's go.
[248:10.60]Why are there bad guys?
[248:11.50]We've already liberated this outpost.
[248:14.34]Recoil.
[248:18.20]Wouldn't recoil make the gun move up and the bullet go up?
[248:21.36]Not to the right?
[248:23.90]Where are you?
[248:25.88]Is a sniper just lying on the ground?
[248:28.00]What are you doing over here?
[248:32.96]I'm fighting this flamethrower guy with just my slingshot.
[248:38.66]And I think he's winning.
[248:42.12]Bad guy?
[248:45.93]Oh, you're slingshotting the dude to death.
[248:47.99]Yeah, but it's not working so well.
[248:51.03]We'll do it the easy way.
[248:53.27]He's burning down my garage.
[248:58.18]What the fuck?
[249:01.02]Is he dead?
[249:01.44]Are there any other fun cars?
[249:07.46]Have I shot a real gun before?
[249:08.62]Yes, I have.
[249:13.83]It's a video game though.
[249:15.83]That's not the same thing.
[249:17.17]Yeah.
[249:19.78]I want the... the other off-roader, but this'll do.
[249:24.78]I don't think we're even gonna use it.
[249:25.94]The story mission's like right here.
[249:29.00]What did I shoot?
[249:29.72]I shot a 9mm, some kind of submachine gun, and some kind of assault rifle.
[249:38.89]Hi.
[249:39.65]Hi.
[249:42.09]I'm here!
[249:49.47]What did I shoot?
[249:51.17]A target.
[249:52.63]At a shooting range.
[249:56.23]Why are they all in this apple orchard?
[249:58.37]Because this game spawns random things.
[250:02.71]There's a bear!
[250:05.43]Oh no.
[250:10.63]What was the target?
[250:11.53]A piece of paper.
[250:17.33]I can't aim like this.
[250:17.91]What does that paper ever do to you?
[250:19.63]I gotta lean out.
[250:27.76]Now we're off-roading.
[250:29.54]Did I like it?
[250:30.46]It was interesting.
[250:35.81]It was very interesting.
[250:39.03]We're there.
[250:42.07]Oh, we are here.
[250:43.11]I mean, that seems bad.
[250:47.82]Those are the people we're saving for the mission, by the way, that you're killing.
[250:51.10]Remember the story mission you wanted to do?
[250:53.68]This is it.
[250:55.22]All right?
[250:56.72]It's all right.
[250:57.32]We're fine.
[250:58.59]Only one person got killed.
[251:02.85]Wait, this is the guy that we... Remember this guy before?
[251:04.53]Oh, yeah.
[251:05.81]It's him again.
[251:12.27]Oh, we're in conflict now.
[251:15.23]With what?
[251:17.44]This person?
[251:18.14]This is a person.
[251:19.68]Who are you?
[251:21.48]There's something over here.
[251:23.20]Yeah, a guy like five miles this way.
[251:27.03]Driving in here with a- Okay, there they are!
[251:29.21]Found ya!
[251:30.55]Who the fuck is this guy?
[251:39.57]This guy looks like he belongs in a Tim and Eric skit.
[251:45.77]Oh, this guy?
[251:47.08]I just wanted to get a good look at him.
[251:51.16]It's like skinny Santa.
[251:56.26]Of course, the whole village is on fire now.
[251:59.24]I'm not trying to shoot him.
[252:00.42]I was trying to get a good look at him.
[252:03.77]See, I'm just trying to take a picture of him.
[252:23.85]Ay-yi-yi.
[252:26.01]Alright.
[252:28.53]Hello.
[252:29.47]Are we ready?
[252:33.72]Yep.
[252:35.60]What?!
[252:38.20]Was it on fire?
[252:43.58]Why was this- what was wrong with the car?
[252:49.77]Okay, well.
[252:51.23]Good.
[252:51.57]What the hell was that?
[253:03.63]Did you break it?
[253:05.13]Did you break this encounter again for like a second or third time?
[253:07.43]Thanks for saving the day here, kid.
[253:10.03]Name's Merle.
[253:10.95]Okay, maybe we're good.
[253:12.45]These sons of bitches are making me regret the day I eased up on their conniving little schemes.
[253:18.01]I fucking knew this would happen.
[253:20.13]Doesn't make a difference now.
[253:22.35]All's I know is we got people to protect.
[253:25.19]I know how to get back at the cult.
[253:27.35]But if we're gonna do it right, we need the Death Wish.
[253:32.18]I am truck it's like auto well it's sitting in a garage that's been overrun by those you head over to u.s auto and get it u.s auto all right all the vehicle deliveries u.s auto cult outpost I think this is a story mission right he had one of those uh yeah death wish story mission
[253:56.99]Oh, this is another outpost.
[253:58.07]We have a second chance at being silent.
[253:59.95]Okay, only use slingshots.
[254:02.05]Let's try to just use slingshots.
[254:04.82]We probably shouldn't walk there.
[254:07.76]Call.
[254:08.84]That's a pretty good call.
[254:10.52]Plane?
[254:11.98]Yeah.
[254:12.76]We're gonna para-drop in.
[254:23.36]Okay.
[254:32.93]What about the boat that has the machine gun on it?
[254:34.87]The hover boat.
[254:38.51]No.
[254:39.28]That would be fun.
[254:40.46]Maybe another time.
[254:41.90]I think this is a lake.
[254:44.38]Like a closed loop lake.
[254:45.70]I'm not sure where that machine gun thing would go.
[254:47.46]Oh, never mind.
[254:51.10]I'd take it back.
[254:52.62]I have a cool plane too, you know.
[254:55.11]Tell me how cool it is when I auto spawn you into mine.
[254:59.89]You're not going to because I'm right behind you.
[255:11.34]So we're parachuting down.
[255:12.72]How would that be stealthy?
[255:18.63]Well, we're going to go up really high.
[255:20.83]And parachute all the way down.
[255:22.81]We can, like, wingsuit in.
[255:24.91]Maybe.
[255:25.35]I mean, we could.
[255:26.37]Not, like, in the middle.
[255:28.96]Like, on the edge, you know?
[255:31.44]I could see that.
[255:32.32]This is just faster than driving there.
[255:35.94]I mean, this is much faster than driving.
[255:38.40]We could fast travel, though, couldn't we?
[255:41.69]Maybe.
[255:42.77]Can we?
[255:44.56]No, it's too late.
[255:45.98]It's pretty far from a fast travel spot.
[255:50.20]We're like almost there.
[255:51.98]Yeah, it's no use fast traveling now.
[255:54.38]We're pretty much there.
[256:02.55]Little high back there.
[256:04.69]How are you?
[256:10.59]I wanted to high five you.
[256:13.94]Alright, so how high are we going to go?
[256:15.88]I think this is about as high as it gets, honestly.
[256:17.88]Is this it?
[256:18.78]Are we going to drop out here?
[256:19.92]I feel like we can just drop here and if you wingsuit fast enough, probably make it the whole distance.
[256:24.82]Okay, let's go.
[256:25.59]Where do I want to go?
[256:31.29]Alright, I'm going.
[256:32.93]So you don't hold W, right?
[256:34.51]I hope they don't see the planes crashing down in sync next to them.
[256:39.00]So what's the game plan here?
[256:41.06]Where are we going?
[256:43.26]I'm going too fast.
[256:45.32]Where are you?
[256:46.38]W goes down.
[256:47.30]S kind of pulls up.
[256:48.60]Can you land?
[256:49.92]Why are you so much faster than me?
[256:51.44]I don't know, but I'm going to land there.
[256:56.12]Another plane is in the air behind you.
[256:57.82]What are you talking about?
[256:59.26]There's another plane chasing you down.
[257:02.96]I'm parachuting.
[257:05.12]That actually worked.
[257:09.99]Wait, did they see you?
[257:11.19]I think the airplane saws.
[257:17.70]Do you have action music or have you been spotted?
[257:22.06]I think we pretty much have been spotted at this point.
[257:27.34]Yes, we definitely have.
[257:29.06]Have we?
[257:29.38]I don't know.
[257:30.52]They didn't see me.
[257:31.10]I would assume if you said there was a plane behind me.
[257:39.24]I don't know.
[257:39.56]These guys seem like they're not on high alert at all.
[257:42.76]Alright, so explosive barrel.
[257:44.34]That's not stealthy.
[257:48.70]Don't worry.
[257:49.04]I'll mark everybody for you.
[257:51.06]How many people are here?
[257:52.94]That is what I'm ascertaining.
[257:56.22]They have a truck with speakers on it.
[257:57.87]Yes, I understand that aspartame is not something you want to be drinking in diet soda.
[258:01.07]But how are we going to target these people?
[258:06.70]Do you want to snipe or do you want to get in close?
[258:08.46]You haven't gotten close the whole game.
[258:10.38]Let's go in close.
[258:11.52]All you do is just right click, left click.
[258:14.25]Screw that.
[258:16.63]Let's get behind you.
[258:18.05]Watch out.
[258:18.41]They can see you from here.
[258:19.41]Alright, I'm going.
[258:22.63]No, don't go.
[258:23.11]I need to change him out.
[258:25.43]There he goes.
[258:28.54]Down the zip line.
[258:29.54]He's doing a good job.
[258:30.24]So we're going to have to double headshot somebody, I'm assuming, right?
[258:34.56]This guy right here can see us through the grass.
[258:36.79]I think the key is going to be taking out that guy on top.
[258:41.05]I could snipe him.
[258:42.19]As long as his body doesn't alert anybody.
[258:44.31]That's what happened last time.
[258:45.17]He slimed all the way over and landed in the middle of everybody.
[258:52.69]You take out the guy next leaning on the bus.
[258:54.81]Leaning on the bus.
[258:56.13]Like this blue bus.
[258:59.03]He's highlighted on the other side of the bus.
[259:01.33]I'm going to take out this guy on the far right edge.
[259:06.05]He's got body armor on though.
[259:06.79]This guy's moving.
[259:09.01]This guy is not... We should go around.
[259:13.05]There's less people on the other side anyways.
[259:15.43]What about the guy next to the yellow bus right here?
[259:17.69]This guy's right here in the yellow bus.
[259:19.21]Sitting there.
[259:20.99]He's got body armor on, so... Body armor's not going to help if you shoot him in the mouth of the rock.
[259:27.44]Can't protect that.
[259:28.12]Uh-oh.
[259:30.44]Did he see you?
[259:33.38]There's no way.
[259:36.74]All you gotta do is run.
[259:39.69]Run, hide.
[259:46.23]Misty, hello!
[259:50.79]Why is stealth so difficult?
[259:54.89]Because it's supposed to be hard, right?
[259:56.33]Alright, they don't know where I am anymore on the roof.
[260:00.09]They know where you are, though.
[260:00.91]That guy's not dead.
[260:06.37]Now he is.
[260:06.81]Is there a way to turn off the alarm afterward?
[260:11.27]Yeah, you definitely can.
[260:14.25]They're coming down the road right now.
[260:18.69]Nice and stealthy.
[260:20.55]That's the way I like it.
[260:23.92]Do it when I can, okay?
[260:25.04]Explosions.
[260:25.76]Do it when I can.
[260:41.96]Liberated.
[260:47.28]Hey, you did it!
[260:48.33]Congratulations.
[260:52.95]Yes, you can disable alarms, but... I mean... When you get spotted and they pull it in the first place, you don't get your extra bonus for being stealthy.
[261:06.66]Now what?
[261:07.90]Isn't there a second part of this mission?
[261:10.50]Didn't we have to take that car?
[261:12.10]Oh, no.
[261:12.24]I think that was definitely not the story mission, though, was it?
[261:14.29]I don't know.
[261:14.75]That was a story mission.
[261:16.91]No, it wasn't.
[261:17.65]It was, wasn't it?
[261:29.99]Looked like it was.
[261:30.55]I guess.
[261:31.29]I guess it was.
[261:32.17]Is anything close to here that's a story mission?
[261:33.99]That's not like a story story mission, though.
[261:36.22]What, like... We're almost all the way done.
[261:40.08]Like, we have 11,275 points out of 13,000.
[261:46.12]to get him to, like, the max level resistance to open up the actual, like, Jaune Seed story mission.
[261:52.01]Will you please get out of the way?
[261:53.13]Me?
[261:54.93]No, this person just wouldn't move, so I had to do that.
[261:58.49]All right.
[262:00.27]So you want to do the... If we do, like, three more resistance things, we open up the, like, conclusion to this area, I think.
[262:09.17]Okay.
[262:12.11]He's just tossing those over the back of his head.
[262:17.78]Right in the head.
[262:18.54]Got him.
[262:21.54]No, you know, I'm not going to have that happen.
[262:23.28]Sorry.
[262:25.14]Maybe some other chump will let that happen.
[262:27.42]Not me.
[262:28.04]Not today.
[262:29.43]You just did the thing where you went to the front of the car and then it's going to explode.
[262:34.23]Any second now.
[262:40.77]Okay.
[262:41.07]Well, apparently you didn't do the thing.
[262:43.69]I thought you were doing the thing.
[262:45.57]But I guess not.
[262:47.21]So let's go.
[262:53.45]Give us something new.
[262:54.71]Fucking asshole.
[263:05.03]It went right to the driver's side window too.
[263:14.36]Throwing Molotov cocktails in incoming cars is pretty good, though.
[263:18.75]Pretty good.
[263:26.12]through a windshield.
[263:27.82]Is it actually broken?
[263:29.00]I think you can.
[263:29.88]Because it looked like I was hitting them.
[263:32.56]It didn't do anything.
[263:33.18]All right, let's go.
[263:34.00]This guy's calling for... No, we got to just do a little... Anytime we see somebody call for help, we just help them.
[263:39.74]Well, that's how you get points.
[263:41.66]You build up points.
[263:42.54]It doesn't matter if we free the outpost.
[263:44.00]We can free the outpost.
[263:45.09]Just anything in this area that we do.
[263:47.33]Story.
[263:48.11]Fishing.
[263:50.00]There probably is a fishing quest.
[263:51.50]No, God.
[263:52.52]No.
[263:52.94]No fishing.
[263:54.08]Get helicopter.
[263:55.08]Get fast to the next thing we need to do.
[263:59.37]Let's look at the map.
[264:01.41]Let's go talk to the pastor.
[264:03.39]It's really close.
[264:04.27]It's really close.
[264:05.65]We couldn't just do the helicopter for this?
[264:07.59]Okay.
[264:08.53]I mean, we could just tank it over there.
[264:11.20]It's going to take just as long for me to spawn it and bring it.
[264:14.38]Here it is.
[264:15.10]No, it's right here.
[264:19.60]Let's go.
[264:23.03]I like that he's here.
[264:24.11]He's parking with us.
[264:27.91]He's not going to get in.
[264:28.67]That's fine.
[264:31.67]Right over there.
[264:33.80]Dump us over there.
[264:40.32]Points.
[264:40.84]75 whole points.
[264:42.60]Nice.
[264:49.40]What about that?
[264:51.26]Not me.
[264:59.79]I got it.
[265:00.93]That was me.
[265:02.09]I got it.
[265:03.97]Who's killing me?
[265:04.63]I don't know.
[265:05.53]These guys down here.
[265:10.20]Okay, we're going to the thing.
[265:11.08]We're going to the thing.
[265:11.84]Going to the thing.
[265:13.20]Going to the thing.
[265:13.96]This is supposed to be the shortcut not to get distracted.
[265:16.62]Yeah, we got too distracted there.
[265:20.46]Alright.
[265:21.94]Uh, here we go.
[265:29.65]Oh, Jesus.
[265:31.01]Did I actually... I got hit by the blades.
[265:42.95]So close.
[265:43.77]Yeah, it was.
[265:45.13]Where are you?
[265:46.45]Jesus!
[265:50.13]What are you doing?
[265:52.35]It's still flying.
[265:54.91]I don't know how.
[265:56.57]I think it'll be fine.
[265:57.24]It's fine.
[265:57.74]Okay, the actual shooting isn't me.
[266:16.13]But this guy really wants a piece of the action.
[266:18.39]I think our friend just died.
[266:20.85]It's the plane guy again.
[266:22.25]He died.
[266:22.69]He got shot down.
[266:25.64]And here, guess who's coming down here to kill us?
[266:27.90]Stay still, pastor.
[266:34.30]I'll get the quest.
[266:35.01]You hold off the reinforcements.
[266:36.15]I'm just going to stand here and get shot to death.
[266:37.85]Don't worry.
[266:40.03]Barry got me, whatever his name is.
[266:56.65]What the hell was that?
[267:00.67]Sniping is not better than fishing.
[267:06.67]Here he comes again.
[267:07.36]Is everything okay out there?
[267:13.30]He just keeps passing and firing hell on us.
[267:17.88]Why does this fishing game have so many guns?
[267:22.80]Alright, let's get- let's do this.
[267:24.16]This is the slow- ATV is the slowest vehicle.
[267:26.26]But it's- we're already here.
[267:27.30]Watch out!
[267:34.12]There's a- there's a spawner.
[267:36.02]Literally.
[267:38.16]Literally.
[267:38.66]I want a police car.
[267:50.85]Where are you?
[267:51.43]Because you need to come help me.
[267:53.73]How do you keep dying?
[267:55.05]Because the plane is dropping fucking missiles on the town.
[267:58.75]Which one are you?
[267:59.95]There's two dead people.
[268:00.95]I don't know which one to go to first.
[268:04.31]Is this one you?
[268:05.33]No, I'm the one further up the road.
[268:07.87]Wait, you're the one that's dead?
[268:09.29]I'm the dead one.
[268:12.00]No, that... I got the right guy.
[268:14.10]No, you didn't.
[268:14.66]This is me.
[268:16.22]Yeah, I let the other guy die.
[268:17.62]Oh, well, cool.
[268:18.64]You got the Back to the Future card.
[268:20.21]Alright, now we're both dead.
[268:21.43]Did he drop a bomb?
[268:25.24]Yeah, he did.
[268:26.10]He did drop a bomb.
[268:26.84]He missed.
[268:29.24]Missed this time.
[268:31.24]I gotta set a waypoint.
[268:37.83]There's explosions further up the road.
[268:43.55]Okay.
[268:43.95]What was that?
[268:45.21]I am on my way.
[268:47.64]To the waypoint.
[268:49.46]I honestly don't know what we're doing.
[268:51.08]I don't think it matters.
[268:52.80]It's called surviving against the World War II planes.
[268:55.43]I'm getting PTSD.
[269:01.29]It's just a paper airplane that won't leave us alone.
[269:05.59]My car is trying its hardest to... Oh, yeah, it was on auto-drive.
[269:09.21]Never mind.
[269:11.93]It was overseering me.
[269:13.87]Here it comes again.
[269:17.85]Wow, he's very accurate.
[269:19.79]There's an eagle here now.
[269:27.45]He's going to drop a bomb on us and it's going to be over.
[269:29.83]See you later.
[269:30.75]Here comes a bomb.
[269:32.94]I knew it.
[269:34.02]I fucking knew it.
[269:40.67]I'm being bullied.
[269:41.97]I feel bullied right now.
[269:43.53]What do you mean by aim?
[269:44.69]He's driving around in a car.
[269:45.75]I have a sniper rifle.
[269:46.85]I can't like shoot the fucking guy out of the plane.
[269:53.16]I'm underneath his belly.
[269:55.48]I'm shooting his underneath turtle shell.
[270:03.77]We're like almost there.
[270:06.23]There's an outpost right here.
[270:07.47]Let's just do the outpost real quick.
[270:10.57]We need to get a better weapon to shoot down the guy that will not leave us alone in the plane.
[270:16.06]I'm just going to call in, Nick.
[270:18.14]That's going to blow up.
[270:19.32]Why?
[270:19.82]Where was it?
[270:22.88]I ran over it.
[270:23.68]It flew over the car and it was not even near me.
[270:25.96]I'm not sure what just happened.
[270:29.34]I drove into a red barrel and it pounced over the car and it blew up like five seconds later.
[270:39.83]Let him drive it.
[270:40.65]Who gives a shit?
[270:41.79]Find your own car.
[270:45.57]Wow.
[270:47.94]This guy doesn't have anything.
[270:49.72]He's kind of just driving on the road.
[270:52.86]Alright, I'll liberate this outpost.
[270:55.46]I got it.
[270:55.90]This guy's telling me to shut my fucking mouth.
[271:01.27]I can handle this.
[271:11.04]Where we going?
[271:18.29]I'm handling the outpost.
[271:20.17]This is not the story mission, but it still gives a bunch of points.
[271:23.35]Don't run over red barrels.
[271:27.31]It's true.
[271:27.73]I don't know where this guy's taking me.
[271:31.02]But... Yeah, this guy has a gun, too.
[271:45.16]One-man army.
[271:49.00]Are you setting off the alarm?
[271:52.74]Are you dead over there, or is that the bad guy?
[271:56.31]That's you, isn't it?
[271:57.03]I mean, I'm dead, but I didn't do any of that.
[271:58.87]You're just in the middle of the outpost.
[272:01.01]Like, the one that I'm... I just took, like, three guys down around.
[272:04.31]I mean, I... Technically, I am dead here, but I didn't do any of those things that you're describing.
[272:09.50]I was simply a bystander that entire exchange.
[272:15.46]I just wanted to watch and see what... and he just kinda... This game is a fucking carnage.
[272:22.21]This game is just total carnage.
[272:24.67]You're gonna get run over.
[272:29.53]Get smoked.
[272:32.25]Are you dead?
[272:32.79]Yes, I am.
[272:33.87]How are you dead?
[272:34.61]Are you gonna get me?
[272:35.91]I was right there!
[272:36.55]No, I was looking at the wrong body.
[272:39.49]Oh, that's... good.
[272:42.59]You're alive.
[272:43.44]Make the most of it.
[272:46.54]You just got perforated by about 30 bullets simultaneously as you stood up.
[272:52.40]All right.
[272:53.72]Well, this time I'm not going to get in the car with a stranger.
[272:55.66]That's what I get for going in a car with somebody that I don't know.
[273:11.11]Well, we are right here, so let's just deliberate it.
[273:18.06]Liberate the outpost.
[273:18.94]That was a nice shot you just shot.
[273:28.42]I... I... Like... I don't understand!
[273:30.59]How did that not hit him?
[273:38.29]Is... Like, how is this guy not dying from these?
[273:43.40]I think they go down, they go into down states kind of like we do sometimes.
[273:51.42]He's gonna blow up.
[273:52.18]This is gonna be great.
[273:54.12]He's almost here.
[273:55.04]Almost here.
[273:56.13]Come on.
[273:56.99]Blow up.
[273:57.53]Your tank is burning.
[273:58.83]Please blow up.
[273:59.79]Blow the fuck up so I can laugh at it.
[274:01.55]Come on!
[274:06.75]Ha.
[274:07.63]Ha.
[274:10.26]You're welcome.
[274:13.58]No alarms.
[274:15.67]Don't ask me how the fuck that's possible.
[274:16.95]Because I shot the guys that were running to the alarm with my bow before they could get there.
[274:27.03]That was stealthy.
[274:27.69]Are we going to get points for this?
[274:32.91]Yeah.
[274:34.91]All right.
[274:35.69]That was a 400 point bonus.
[274:37.77]Good.
[274:38.59]We're like on the meter right now.
[274:43.93]We are at 12,000 out of 13,000.
[274:45.87]So we need to do one more thing.
[274:48.49]Well, that was 400 points.
[274:49.97]We need 1,000 points.
[274:50.93]So story mission may be more.
[274:53.45]Let's just chain them together.
[274:57.12]Let's do another one.
[274:58.90]So we can see the big reveal here at the end.
[275:01.66]This is the story mission that we're on that I just marked.
[275:04.92]Cool.
[275:05.38]And we're going to see if this is all worthwhile or not.
[275:07.58]It better be a good mission.
[275:09.85]How are these still locked?
[275:13.46]Okay, do you have access?
[275:15.02]Can I ask you?
[275:15.42]Do you have access to all the weapons pretty much here?
[275:18.33]No.
[275:18.73]I think they're mission locked.
[275:21.39]I have access.
[275:22.17]So which tab?
[275:23.13]Just any of them.
[275:24.25]I have the most pistols.
[275:26.71]I have five pistols.
[275:29.17]Two shotguns.
[275:30.45]We got a new shotgun that we can buy.
[275:31.91]I like this thing.
[275:33.41]I want that.
[275:36.93]Which one?
[275:37.27]I like this revolver.
[275:42.87]I'm big into the revolver, especially when they look cool like that.
[275:49.35]No scope.
[275:50.06]I mean, it is pretty much tradition that I put a huge scope on my revolver, so I kind of have to do it at some point here.
[275:56.28]I like that.
[275:59.94]Tempted by the spike bat.
[276:13.77]All right, I'm ready to go.
[276:15.71]Wait, I might have loot to sell.
[276:17.93]Yes, I do.
[276:19.67]I'm getting rid of the slingshot.
[276:22.29]It's not worthy of a slot in the inventory.
[276:24.43]It is not, you're right.
[276:25.25]So I'm going to have to get rid of it, too.
[276:30.71]I'm just going to put on the... And I actually have a weapon that's not just a long-range weapon.
[276:44.67]I am ready to play the game.
[276:46.37]Are we going that way?
[276:47.09]650 milliliters that way?
[276:49.83]You got it.
[276:50.19]650, fill her up.
[276:51.63]Get in.
[276:52.29]All right.
[276:58.95]The game has slingshots?
[276:59.75]Yeah.
[277:00.73]They're very hard to use, though.
[277:01.63]It has a slingshot, and I'm not real sure what it's for.
[277:06.00]You're fine.
[277:09.90]It has infinite ammo, but it has no damage.
[277:11.68]This is going well.
[277:15.67]Pick up some speed.
[277:18.53]The sign did that, by the way.
[277:21.02]If you're curious.
[277:22.46]I know.
[277:22.82]That was not my intention.
[277:25.84]And what happened now?
[277:27.94]Don't get out.
[277:29.02]What is in the way?
[277:29.68]I bet I get there faster.
[277:31.12]I bet you don't.
[277:32.39]I bet I do.
[277:33.05]I'll race you.
[277:34.11]Oh, no.
[277:35.83]I'll race him.
[277:42.81]It's happening.
[277:44.13]You gotta be kidding me.
[277:45.27]They did this on purpose.
[277:50.42]I'm even stopping for loot.
[277:52.12]Yeah, that's fine.
[278:01.74]I knew you were coming.
[278:05.86]Just couldn't pull out my grenade fast enough.
[278:07.46]Reviving.
[278:09.15]Got him.
[278:13.11]Hey, by the way, I'll beat you there.
[278:14.27]Don't pull this bullshit now.
[278:18.45]Now this is on fire, isn't it?
[278:20.43]You did this.
[278:21.13]They did this.
[278:22.61]Get in here.
[278:24.07]Get in.
[278:24.49]I'm gonna beat you.
[278:25.09]Get in.
[278:25.83]Why are you... I'm only 180 meters.
[278:35.60]And closing.
[278:41.50]You've taken the long road.
[278:42.72]I have zero arrows for some reason.
[278:51.89]I made it!
[278:54.49]Why did the car explode?
[278:56.59]As he says, you've got to attack quietly.
[279:00.75]Well, you put too much pressure on me to go in there and you get me... How did you explode?
[279:05.52]I don't know.
[279:06.00]I think the guy was wearing a gas tank for some reason.
[279:11.52]Well, I don't have any arrows, so I guess this works.
[279:16.14]Oh, my God.
[279:19.34]That was a hostage.
[279:21.70]Oh, God damn it.
[279:22.89]Did you kill a hostage?
[279:23.99]No, they did.
[279:24.85]They did this.
[279:26.41]It's because they said you have to go in quietly so as not to get the hostages killed.
[279:31.39]You're going to lower our score points, and we're not going to unlock it.
[279:34.03]Well, maybe if you weren't dicking around and throwing molotovs at me.
[279:37.24]Oh, yeah.
[279:39.90]What's that?
[279:40.42]In the house?
[279:45.32]Alright, got a guy.
[279:49.48]Is that it?
[279:49.92]How many more?
[279:52.04]I just got seven new fishing spots revealed.
[279:59.25]Careful.
[280:00.91]Get out of the way.
[280:07.47]Get out of the way.
[280:08.15]Why are you...
[280:16.72]Why are you throwing smoke at me?
[280:19.22]I'm not even over there.
[280:20.36]First of all.
[280:22.79]Secure the farm.
[280:25.45]We did.
[280:26.41]We're turning on each other.
[280:29.61]Just what they want.
[280:30.45]Cool.
[280:32.30]Story.
[280:32.98]The Illuminati.
[280:33.82]Fishing.
[280:34.28]Thumbs up.
[280:35.66]How many points?
[280:38.77]We got, that was 600 pointos.
[280:41.57]All right.
[280:42.31]One more little mission and we're good.
[280:43.57]Where's the dog?
[280:44.39]And we have... Get this dog out of here.
[280:46.93]375 left.
[280:47.91]How do we rescue the dog?
[280:50.83]Don't shoot the dog.
[280:51.67]Rescue him.
[280:52.07]I just rescued him.
[280:52.93]All right, get out.
[280:53.77]Get out of the way.
[280:56.93]Everything's going to be fine.
[280:59.50]No worries.
[281:01.26]We're good.
[281:02.04]Go free.
[281:04.16]I said hold tab to track that mission.
[281:09.13]And they didn't do anything.
[281:11.23]I mean, I see there's something down there.
[281:12.92]Well, I just manually clicked that button.
[281:15.52]Rice?
[281:16.66]Friendly Rice?
[281:17.66]Are we?
[281:18.10]Yeah.
[281:22.78]We just did two missions.
[281:24.32]That really threw me off.
[281:26.45]Did we get points for that?
[281:31.43]Yeah.
[281:31.81]What did we do?
[281:32.51]I guess we did two missions in a row.
[281:38.73]What was the mission?
[281:39.39]I don't know.
[281:40.47]We just unlocked some new weapons, apparently.
[281:42.53]We're just talking about weapon locks.
[281:47.04]So this is where we killed this guy.
[281:51.74]The Atonement.
[281:52.76]That's just down there, right?
[281:57.16]The Atonement.
[281:57.82]Reach falls in.
[281:58.66]John Cena has invited you to atone for your sins.
[282:00.99]Did you say John Cena?
[282:03.99]John Cena invited us?
[282:05.83]Would it be better if I did?
[282:07.27]Maybe.
[282:09.28]is John Lucena is waiting to pop out from behind.
[282:14.32]Really?
[282:17.62]Did I just, like, kick your ass?
[282:20.07]Me?
[282:20.19]What happened?
[282:20.73]What?
[282:22.21]Where are you?
[282:22.57]Why didn't you just pull me back?
[282:23.61]I was beating you in the race.
[282:24.31]Because we're going... The race is... You were heading the opposite direction.
[282:29.43]Yeah.
[282:29.55]What do you mean I was beating you in the race?
[282:32.73]It's this way.
[282:34.75]If you got teleported, it's because you were going the wrong way.
[282:38.35]Easy!
[282:40.12]driving those people so radically.
[282:44.18]Who?
[282:45.80]No one's there.
[282:46.42]You made like the John Cena reference and I lost track.
[282:52.83]You ready to go to church?
[282:53.75]I'm ready.
[282:58.73]Okay, that's where we're going.
[283:03.13]I don't know if that's going to work.
[283:09.70]Is there a bridge?
[283:10.98]There is a bridge right there.
[283:19.41]Someone sees us.
[283:20.61]Got him.
[283:22.35]What if I just went through the window and hit him right in the head and we beat the mission?
[283:25.77]You think that would get on the front of like... Like John Seed, you killed the main boss of the game?
[283:30.17]Do you think that would be on the front page of all the internet?
[283:35.84]I think it would.
[283:36.42]What if I just drive a truck into the church?
[283:39.28]Try.
[283:39.56]We have a red carpet event here.
[283:41.64]I would just try, yeah.
[283:42.46]Try to drive in.
[283:45.32]Somebody getting married or something?
[283:51.79]Well, that looked... We can't go in the building now, so... We have to back it up.
[284:01.10]You back up.
[284:10.77]Okay.
[284:12.71]Time for the cutscene and time for the... Well... Wouldn't that guy have been seriously injured if we drove into the door like that?
[284:26.55]What's funny is I actually rigged the truck to explode and it actually exploded during that cutscene.
[284:31.30]Hold still.
[284:33.85]Uh-oh.
[284:37.70]He knows you.
[284:41.04]He knows you.
[284:46.60]Yeah, we already watched this cutscene.
[284:50.83]He's just gotta finish the tattoo.
[284:53.09]He didn't get it finished before.
[284:54.87]What is going on right now?
[284:56.31]Is the cutscene on fire?
[284:59.25]I told you I exploded the truck before the cutscene it's catching the church on fire the church is actually yes the church is actually on fire right now oh I wish it burnt up everybody the windows are breaking right now there's still a chance there's fire in the window let's begin
[285:24.67]Come on, get in there!
[285:26.77]Get in there and burn everybody up.
[285:28.01]We've still got time!
[285:29.05]It may only catch the facade on fire, though.
[285:32.21]The other back is on fire.
[285:35.16]The door... It might go in.
[285:38.96]Get in there.
[285:39.98]You got us out.
[285:42.22]You made us get away.
[285:44.48]The little, like, waiter dropping the plates is making me... Making the cutscene as possible to watch.
[285:56.68]The fire is really close now.
[285:58.15]The podium is on fire.
[286:01.51]What if he goes back there to preach?
[286:04.14]Oh no, it's almost over.
[286:06.42]Let's try that again.
[286:07.44]It's almost done spreading.
[286:11.54]I don't think he can catch the floor on fire.
[286:13.04]We are devoted.
[286:13.42]We are gathered here to bear witness.
[286:16.13]I wish.
[286:16.39]To those willing to atone for their sins.
[286:19.05]To those willing to atone for their sins.
[286:22.21]Will you, Nick Rye, place your hand upon the word of Joseph?
[286:25.65]Will you, Nick Rye, place your hand upon the word of Joseph?
[286:29.59]Hey, guys, it's the Walking Dead character.
[286:33.17]Everyone loves Darius.
[286:35.25]There it is.
[286:37.34]Greed.
[286:39.02]Always thinking of yourself.
[286:40.12]Oh, he did that in The Walking Dead, too.
[286:42.08]No, he just spit it right in his mouth.
[286:45.86]Now he has his DNA to make his phone.
[286:47.60]Mm-hmm.
[287:04.96]Yeah.
[287:11.83]Yes.
[287:13.75]Yes, I will, Tom.
[287:16.85]A guarantee in his ear, he said.
[287:19.27]If you don't say yes, I will kill your entire family.
[287:21.93]Mm-hmm.
[287:25.11]No!
[287:25.53]No!
[287:26.64]No!
[287:32.71]What did he get?
[287:34.48]That's a large piece of face.
[287:38.74]What is it?
[287:39.20]What is that?
[287:39.68]It's a piece of paper.
[287:40.34]It was chest?
[287:43.08]You just took out his spleen or his liver or something.
[287:48.00]He just stapled his stomach to the wall.
[287:50.58]What body part is that though, actually?
[287:53.32]I don't know.
[288:08.44]You deputy place your hand upon the word.
[288:10.99]Yes as fast as possible you Deputy place your hand upon the word of Joseph your sins and admit your transgressions Renounce your sins and admit your transgressions Say yes Okay It's just one word wait a minute it's upside down That was me.

[288:39.23]All right, this is a GTA chase mission.
[288:43.57]All right, one, two, three, action.
[288:52.16]Take me to my airstrip.
[289:09.13]Right between the legs.
[289:14.39]What happened?
[289:15.43]Oh, I was looking for a dog!
[289:19.64]Save me, save me.
[289:20.36]I was looking over there for a dog.
[289:24.42]That was my dog.
[289:25.52]I heard like, and I thought that dogs were spawning on us.
[289:28.30]Where did she come from?
[289:35.43]Where did she come from?
[289:39.00]Let's do it.
[289:41.40]Sorry, she's the driver.
[289:42.61]I didn't realize.
[289:43.21]How do you know there was a gun in the Bible?
[289:44.89]Wait, what happened to you?
[289:47.97]I had to pick her up because I didn't realize she was the... I'll drive you.
[289:51.97]No, she won't let me.
[289:53.63]She's driving the car.
[289:56.18]She's driving.
[289:56.90]Oh, yeah, she's driving.
[289:58.06]Okay.
[289:59.82]I've got a bow.
[290:09.78]That came... It popped in on my screen.
[290:14.38]Maybe a multiplayer thing?
[290:21.08]I have 10 bullets left in this gun, and then that's it.
[290:24.22]There's somebody in front of us, too.
[290:29.18]Why would she drive right into that?
[290:31.04]AI driver, please!
[290:33.71]There's also an airplane.
[290:34.65]I'm calling another support.
[290:35.61]I'm calling an air support.
[290:40.24]Nope, it's unavailable.
[290:44.93]I'm gonna have to kill it.
[290:49.69]Where's the plane?
[290:53.47]Uh, there is a plane behind us.
[290:55.57]I have marked it for you.
[290:59.82]I assume he can't blow up.
[291:02.18]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[291:06.96]I didn't kill the good plane, did I?
[291:08.53]No.
[291:10.67]It won't let me shoot this guy.
[291:13.14]This one guy.
[291:14.00]Hey, get the plane.
[291:21.86]It's on our six.
[291:25.32]I'm sure my shotgun is really helping here.
[291:27.58]That thing's not going to crash in front of us.
[291:29.92]Oh, my God.
[291:32.48]Don't worry, I got a stick.
[291:42.36]Did you get him?
[291:42.80]That sounded like an I got him sound effect.
[291:44.67]I mean, kind of.
[291:48.27]Got one.
[291:49.63]That's it, right?
[291:52.67]Right ahead.
[291:54.17]Point!
[291:57.95]One of you.
[291:58.43]Oh no.
[292:00.46]Dot move at... Another fucking plane.
[292:05.24]I think it's our plane.
[292:06.36]That's our plane?
[292:07.42]Yeah, I think that one's ours.
[292:08.68]Oh god, I'm gonna die.
[292:09.58]Oh god, oh god, oh god, oh god.
[292:10.62]I don't have any healing.
[292:13.28]Are you sure?
[292:13.58]That doesn't look like our plane.
[292:16.11]I think she said that.
[292:17.09]Oh, wait.
[292:17.39]Maybe it is theirs.
[292:19.93]But it just bombed the bad guys.
[292:22.01]All right.
[292:22.53]We're about to hop out.
[292:23.53]I have zero ammo except shotgun.
[292:27.17]Oh, we're getting in the plane.
[292:31.17]Where is this guy?
[292:31.91]I'm going to die.
[292:34.56]I got, like, eaten alive there.
[292:35.78]I'm dead.
[292:36.34]All right.
[292:36.68]Hang on.
[292:40.83]Alright, we just have to get in the plane?
[292:41.97]We just have to get in the plane, that's the whole goal.
[292:44.61]Get in plane.
[292:45.09]That's it.
[292:47.83]John's in the air!
[292:53.63]Alright, in plane.
[292:55.45]Are we okay?
[292:57.23]Destroy John's plane.
[292:59.53]He's dead ahead, 500 meters away.
[293:01.67]Is it gonna be all you?
[293:02.53]Because I can't aim that way.
[293:04.67]Well, I might not get him on the first go, so you're gonna have to come in with the 50 count.
[293:08.66]I'll come in with the...
[293:10.62]He's like right here, it says.
[293:11.78]Oh, there he is.
[293:14.46]He's going to pass us in the front.
[293:16.36]I see.
[293:16.76]All right.
[293:17.32]Wow.
[293:17.52]Okay.
[293:32.70]Uh-oh.
[293:33.34]We're smoking.
[293:34.48]Are we actually smoking on break?
[293:35.98]We're actually smoking.
[293:37.48]He's winning.
[293:38.54]He's winning, and I can't steer.
[293:40.72]Dude, I can't shoot him like this.
[293:43.94]I'm stuck sideways.
[293:44.86]I can't shoot him like this.
[293:45.68]We're going down.
[293:46.16]No, we're not.
[293:48.12]We're going down.
[293:48.82]Get out.
[293:49.34]Abandon ship.
[293:49.90]What?
[293:54.18]Already.
[293:55.20]We only got one strafe.
[293:58.66]That was very anticlimactic.
[294:02.37]I have zero control of the airplane.
[294:05.49]Can we just shoot him?
[294:06.89]I have no bullets, so... You don't have any bullets?
[294:09.51]I have no... I have shotgun bullets.
[294:11.01]What if he's an idiot and he flies through the trees?
[294:13.12]Wait, there's a guy over here.
[294:15.56]He might be a moron.
[294:16.38]He might fly into the trees.
[294:25.48]I got bullets.
[294:27.54]Okay, well, maybe we should just try to get him to run into a tree.
[294:29.74]I'm gonna die.
[294:32.19]Where are you?
[294:33.97]I had to go get a gun.
[294:35.17]Are you okay?
[294:44.43]This is not a fight I'm supposed to be in right now.
[294:50.80]He's behind the tree.
[294:51.60]I can't shoot him from there.
[294:52.32]All right.
[294:53.86]I have ammo.
[294:54.52]I can actually contribute.
[294:56.34]There's no way we're going to be able to take his plane down like this, though.
[294:58.46]Oh, my Lord.
[295:02.01]I mean we get we kind of can't do anything We kind of just wait till we have to we have to like throw a grenade at him or something I got an idea if this may ruin the whole mission, but but what is it gonna?
[295:12.46]What do you think?
[295:12.88]I'm thinking we go to the plane spawn see if we can fast travel there and I stay in the mission Let me try something first what?
[295:20.74]That might that actually might work Wait, what did he's wrong?
[295:28.89]He just dropped a bunch of shit
[295:31.20]I think it's the explosions knocked them off the top of the roof.
[295:34.46]Okay, get on the roof.
[295:35.48]We're going to throw grenades and cook them.
[295:39.58]Look at him.
[295:39.90]He's right here.
[295:40.54]He flies right next to this.
[295:41.58]We can craft more TNT.
[295:43.16]Okay, so just be careful.
[295:44.66]I got TNT in my hand.
[295:46.10]We're going to try to blow it up.
[295:49.60]There is wood up here and shit.
[295:50.78]All right, here we go.
[295:51.42]Here he comes.
[295:59.16]I actually got a hit.
[296:00.98]It didn't do much.
[296:02.12]Watch out.
[296:02.85]Flamethrower is on the roof.
[296:04.03]Flamethrower.
[296:04.71]Fiddler on the roof.
[296:12.81]There, he's dead.
[296:13.39]Oh my god.
[296:14.21]Give me a break.
[296:15.36]Fiddler on the roof.
[296:17.18]I'm dead.
[296:19.46]Are you?
[296:19.74]Miraculously, I'm not.
[296:25.83]Alright, here he comes.
[296:26.63]Well, no.
[296:26.87]Oh, he's dead.
[296:27.69]Never mind.
[296:29.07]I'm gonna craft some more.
[296:32.54]Gotta use that crafting system.
[296:35.00]He's turning around for another one.
[296:35.92]Okay, here we go.
[296:43.70]I think I hit him, but I'm dead.
[296:44.90]I feel like we hit him, and if we didn't...
[296:47.66]This idea isn't going to last us very long because he's still at 98% health.
[296:52.85]Are you dead?
[296:53.45]I had to get in the way.
[296:56.23]We're going to have to try plan B. What's plan B?
[296:59.29]Plan B is possibly going to ruin the mission.
[297:01.53]Are you just going to travel us?
[297:06.83]Why do we hear his radio signals?
[297:08.87]There is another option.
[297:10.25]There's a general shop right next to us and we can try to RPG the plane.
[297:13.60]Let's do it.
[297:14.90]Well, it's 100 meters away.
[297:15.85]We'll get there.
[297:16.73]Just pick up... Get the RPG.
[297:21.15]Wow, that hurt.
[297:22.03]Big time.
[297:22.35]I think it's like... Is he dead?
[297:24.11]The guy disappeared.
[297:24.85]I don't know.
[297:26.89]I had him marked, and now he's gone.
[297:28.01]All right, we got to do... We got to do plan B, then.
[297:31.54]We need a plan B. We got to travel, or we have to... Let's see if it keeps us in the mission or not.
[297:38.72]It might.
[297:39.46]Because there's nothing else to be done.
[297:42.29]I can't believe that we took three hits on the plane and instantly died.
[297:47.39]Yeah, so I was right in the engine.
[297:50.55]Well, I think it just restarts the mission.
[297:54.23]No.
[297:54.95]Alright, let's do it.
[298:00.62]That's Alex.
[298:02.94]What?
[298:03.52]You just crashed.
[298:05.12]No, I didn't.
[298:05.84]Yeah, well, maybe not on your screen.
[298:07.50]You did on mine.
[298:08.14]I just went through the... Is that a bad guy helicopter?
[298:14.38]It is, isn't it?
[298:14.94]All right, no mercy this time.
[298:20.56]It's all or nothing.
[298:21.80]No mercy.
[298:23.98]And that's... I'm just going to shoot the missiles.
[298:27.95]Yeah, you got to get him with a direct missile shot.
[298:32.33]He just starts out going sideways.
[298:33.99]Good shot.
[298:56.43]I feel like you blew us up somehow.
[298:58.01]Do you want to talk about it?
[299:00.21]I don't know if that's even possible.
[299:02.07]I feel like there was no one else.
[299:05.17]Who was even available?
[299:08.77]I don't know.
[299:09.33]Duh.
[299:13.72]I don't know if I'm... Here's an idea.
[299:15.04]I'm not even sure what happened there.
[299:16.51]Okay, we're just in the air now.
[299:17.95]Alright.
[299:19.15]I'm not letting that motherfucker get away with this.
[299:23.37]I can fly if you need.
[299:24.09]I'm hiring Nick at this point.
[299:26.13]I mean, you kind of have to.
[299:27.11]Nick's coming in.
[299:28.07]Nick's coming in for the support.
[299:29.75]We clearly need help.
[299:34.50]He flew next to us and he instantly died.
[299:38.48]I did bounce really high.
[299:44.58]Alright, here we go.
[299:46.76]Wow, we get some bonus dialogue.
[299:48.36]Good luck.
[299:49.12]Oh, he's got a tail gunner!
[300:02.15]He has a tail gunner!
[300:02.95]Oh my god, I'm out.
[300:10.55]How we doing?
[300:11.39]This mission is impossible.
[300:20.97]I like that.
[300:21.43]Okay, can I spawn on Nick?
[300:23.29]There's no way.
[300:24.65]Nick is chasing him down now.
[300:26.42]Nick is going to win the mission for us.
[300:28.84]There was no way.
[300:30.12]What's going on right now?
[300:30.84]Oh, okay.
[300:31.28]I was like, am I stopped?
[300:34.78]Fuck.
[300:35.34]He's going for you.
[300:35.92]He's like diving you.
[300:41.51]I got an idea.
[300:43.31]Come on.
[300:43.81]What?
[300:44.65]Fly over me again.
[300:47.45]You don't even have a parachute out.
[300:52.22]Do you not see my parachute?
[300:53.74]Really?
[300:56.56]Am I flying again?
[301:02.82]Where are you even floating down?
[301:05.06]You can close your suit, you know?
[301:08.64]Yeah, but I mean, I don't.
[301:09.74]What am I going to do?
[301:10.32]Well, apparently he's going down.
[301:19.45]Well, if he is, it's because Nick can't be killed.
[301:22.54]Get the bunker key.
[301:25.40]Nick is actually crashing into a tree as we speak, though.
[301:28.25]I don't even see him on the map.
[301:30.67]Where even is he?
[301:31.21]I'm in just no man's land right now.
[301:39.22]Hi.
[301:39.72]Hi.
[301:44.06]So, it would seem that we didn't blow up the guy.
[301:48.79]But yet... What?
[301:51.81]Oh, no.
[301:52.13]Don't worry.
[301:52.77]We just literally got special infected spawned on us.
[301:57.01]They came from the lake.
[301:58.77]Thanks for the free stuff, though.
[301:59.77]Appreciate it.
[302:01.95]Just wanted to make sure we weren't stuck anywhere.
[302:05.99]Okay.
[302:06.35]I think he's still getting away.
[302:10.52]Is he on your map?
[302:11.70]Yeah, he's still... John, yeah.
[302:13.94]I don't see him anywhere.
[302:15.20]He must have... There must be a phase two where you blow up his plane, then he like... Is this drivable?
[302:25.52]I assume it is.
[302:26.78]It looks like it.
[302:30.74]We didn't even get to shoot the plane.
[302:32.86]Like, I shot him like three times.
[302:34.84]I feel like we had a disproportionate amount of health versus his plane.
[302:37.64]Correct.
[302:39.75]We took a scratch and instantly exploded.
[302:41.50]We shoot him once and it doesn't even matter.
[302:44.38]I'm going to fall in the lake in a second.
[302:48.42]We could get a new plane.
[302:52.24]There's a plane depot right there.
[302:53.84]Let's go get one.
[302:58.31]I feel like he's on the road now.
[303:05.40]We're really struggling here, okay guys?
[303:07.60]This is not going well.
[303:12.75]I feel like that's not our fault, though.
[303:15.17]No, this is not.
[303:16.79]Definitely not.
[303:18.43]But, like, could use a break, you know what I mean?
[303:22.17]I think you had a good call with the plane.
[303:25.80]Let me find a quick... How many radio stations are there?
[303:31.00]That's a good question.
[303:31.72]Get the bunker key.
[303:35.68]So he's about to come in for a strafe, I think.
[303:37.62]Is he?
[303:38.92]John has departed my game.
[303:42.54]Really?
[303:42.74]There's no thing in the sky?
[303:45.83]Nope.
[303:48.67]What?
[303:51.73]He's not 500 meters away?
[303:53.49]In the air?
[303:54.79]I don't see him.
[303:55.39]Do you see him in the air?
[303:56.53]I mean, I see like a reticule, like a target this guy.
[304:01.39]I mean...
[304:04.50]Maybe.
[304:06.48]I see Nick up there.
[304:07.82]Nick is all the way up there in his diamond.
[304:11.20]Alright, let's go solve the problem.
[304:19.07]We're solving the issue.
[304:24.03]Right this second.
[304:24.95]Now I can get.
[304:30.88]Where's my...
[304:34.09]Where is it?
[304:36.57]Can you not spawn it?
[304:38.26]Vehicle delivery in progress.
[304:40.90]And it's not there.
[304:46.14]Do you see a helicopter?
[304:47.10]I think he's just walking around over there.
[304:50.83]He's just on the ground over there, man.
[304:54.11]Is there something in the spot where the helicopter spawns?
[304:56.75]It's locked for me.
[305:05.64]Is he?
[305:06.64]We're just NPCs.
[305:08.18]Somebody else beat the encounter for us.
[305:10.22]He's dead.
[305:11.54]John died.
[305:12.13]Is he?
[305:13.45]Just get in.
[305:13.85]We just have to go over there.
[305:15.91]Okay.
[305:21.70]Sorry, I don't have time to listen about Larry right now.
[305:25.50]I got more important things like...
[305:30.41]He landed and he's running away.
[305:34.68]Well, he died somehow.
[305:36.66]Good job.
[305:44.96]Alright.
[305:46.22]Is he dead in the backseat?
[305:48.20]I don't understand.
[305:50.49]Is that him driving the car?
[305:56.74]That is him.
[305:57.88]And he's dead.
[306:00.56]Did you kill him?
[306:01.80]No, I didn't.
[306:08.55]Dear God, please!
[306:11.65]Just let us do this thing!
[306:12.85]I tried to get out of the fucking car, and I went to the backseat.
[306:17.41]This mission is fucking stupid.
[306:19.89]I don't know why.
[306:23.10]This mission is supposed to be the climax of this entire area.
[306:27.66]Just get us over there.
[306:29.25]We were just over there and exploded for no reason.
[306:31.83]No, we did because we drove into his car or something.
[306:34.07]I have no idea.
[306:36.39]Watch the clip back, please.
[306:38.13]There was nothing.
[306:38.97]We get shot out of the air in five seconds in the dogfight.
[306:42.09]Every time.
[306:44.03]He's right there.
[306:44.61]I'm going to fucking shoot him.
[306:46.47]Kill him!
[306:48.75]Oh, he died.
[306:49.27]We won.
[306:49.79]Mission over.
[306:50.37]John Seed is dead.
[306:53.62]I'm not convinced that he's actually dead.
[306:55.04]There's gonna be like a, like a, requiescent passe, like, cutscene.
[306:59.48]He's not actually dead, we just wounded him enough to get a finale cutscene with him.
[307:03.12]Guaranteed.
[307:04.52]Even though I just ran him over.
[307:10.23]Told you.
[307:16.29]What if Joseph is right?
[307:19.01]Did you ever stop to think about that?
[307:23.83]Everyone thinks he's crazy, but he's not.
[307:28.69]Look around you.
[307:29.35]How did his plane crash, and how did he get out?
[307:30.97]This world is on the brink.
[307:33.21]You can feel it.
[307:34.41]I'm more concerned with the, like, eight .50 cal bullets, and I ran them over.
[307:39.04]Look who's in charge.
[307:43.98]You want this key?
[307:45.90]Because you think you're saving people, but they are already safe.
[307:51.38]We had a plan.
[307:56.41]You don't understand.
[307:58.92]You don't believe.
[308:00.48]You don't care!
[308:05.78]May God have mercy on your soul.
[308:08.44]Are you serious?
[308:14.06]He doesn't just die, right?
[308:16.08]You go from talking perfect, plain English to I'm instantly dead now.
[308:23.70]Well, I don't think he's dead yet.
[308:25.14]I mean... He's coming with us.
[308:34.10]We're taking him around for the rest of the game.
[308:36.75]Just in case he wakes up, we've got to be sure.
[308:41.41]You think that's a joke?
[308:43.63]For the rest of the game, if he is not with us, like the gnomon left for dead, then we lose.
[308:48.61]I mean, what else is there?
[308:55.09]We got problems.
[308:57.07]I got... No, no, god damn it.
[309:01.47]Don't take the gun, you fucking stupid.
[309:05.73]I'm literally trying to pick you up and there's a gun on the ground.
[309:07.91]I do not want my face to be there.
[309:09.87]There's a gun on the ground and it's like, take the gun instead.
[309:14.62]What's more pressing at that current moment?
[309:19.28]Oh my god.
[309:23.86]he better still be on the ground god damn it he's already gone he's already gone and the bad guys were there this many bad guys in the last three no no I thought you said last far cry I don't think there's many people in the last whole game
[309:50.87]Like, last stream, I don't remember being hurt.
[309:53.25]Here comes a moose.
[309:55.01]What?
[309:55.33]Where?
[309:55.63]Here comes a moose, and an army of bad guys.
[309:58.09]Alright, Scott.
[310:01.57]It's just, it's just like, give me a fucking break, man.
[310:13.47]It's just people driving, it's just people spawn on you and shoot you with machine guns.
[310:17.33]It hurts.
[310:20.36]It's just like... Border Patrol.
[310:23.21]It's not even Border Patrol, it's just if you stand in the same spot for more than 10 seconds, five cars surround you with guys with fucking 100 caliber rifles.
[310:31.39]The last stream though, we did not have this much problems.
[310:34.19]You can't stand still, you have to leave.
[310:35.59]Like we have to go now.
[310:37.07]Now, like right now.
[310:38.43]Forget about the fucking helicopter that's there.
[310:40.47]We gotta get a car and get on the road and drive now.
[310:42.58]Get off the road, we gotta get in the woods.
[310:44.84]Where they can't find us.
[310:46.76]Get in the woods.
[310:48.76]How are they still shooting at me?
[310:50.58]Get out.
[310:52.74]Get out of the car.
[310:53.60]Survival game now.
[310:54.66]What hit me?
[310:55.74]Something shot me.
[310:56.28]I don't know from where.
[310:57.85]Where are you?
[310:59.05]This is part two of a way out.
[311:00.59]We've escaped.
[311:01.91]We're on the run.
[311:02.57]Get in the car.
[311:03.43]The canine units.
[311:05.37]I'm in the woods.
[311:06.07]Are you just running in the woods?
[311:07.44]I'm just in the woods where it's safe.
[311:09.40]Where I can be left alone and live a life.
[311:12.70]You know, it's a simple life, but it's a good one.
[311:14.50]Alright, hide.
[311:15.52]Get on in.
[311:18.78]You have to hide in the woods in this game.
[311:20.86]Are you sure it's safe?
[311:22.34]It's a survival... No, it's not even a survival horror game.
[311:24.53]It's just an apocalypse simulator.
[311:27.41]No, not even.
[311:28.37]This is just the way it is when you play in a full server on GTA Online.
[311:32.69]That's all this is.
[311:33.85]Full GTA, yeah.
[311:36.11]No, forget that.
[311:37.60]Double the amount of players.
[311:38.60]We're not going that way.
[311:39.32]Look at that.
[311:42.07]It's like a 50 person GTA online server.
[311:48.60]What did you even want to do?
[311:52.76]I'm driving to this marker here.
[311:55.90]Are we?
[311:56.30]And sometimes the people are animals.
[311:59.16]Reach John C's bunker.
[312:00.22]Okay.
[312:00.42]There you go.
[312:06.58]I don't know what that is, but I'm not getting out.
[312:09.92]I got your marker set up.
[312:10.98]It's ready to go.
[312:16.95]Oh no, it's a modder.
[312:18.47]Yeah, the animals are just modders.
[312:29.55]64 and a GTA Online server.
[312:32.30]Because they go around and cruise.
[312:34.98]Each car has like four people that are playing together.
[312:38.39]Some people, there's people driving around in planes, raining bombs on everybody.
[312:53.28]Can't turn off that music.
[312:54.85]Can you turn off the radio?
[312:55.67]Because my key bind doesn't work now.
[312:58.03]Cannot.
[312:58.21]Enjoy your copyright strike.
[313:08.83]In the woods.
[313:09.37]How do people play this game on hard difficulty?
[313:11.35]You don't, you just don't.
[313:15.86]And if you do, your life is a living hell if you play this on hard.
[313:23.92]We should have seen what new weapons we unlocked.
[313:27.18]Assuming there's gonna be bad guys here, right?
[313:32.40]What is that?
[313:32.90]Alright, let's just get out.
[313:34.32]Let's just get out.
[313:35.10]So we don't... Don't set off any alarms.
[313:36.52]Alright, no alarms.
[313:37.34]It's 200 meters away.
[313:38.89]Blasting like Van Halen.
[313:43.53]Rolling off on a stealth mission.
[313:49.33]I got one arrow.
[313:50.42]I'm gonna make... This is the one arrow stealth challenge.
[313:52.88]Is this bad?
[313:53.32]It's bad.
[313:53.78]Dead ahead.
[313:57.76]You better... What?
[314:01.30]I just got... I got lazy.
[314:03.54]Yeah?
[314:04.50]I hit the first guy first shot.
[314:05.66]I didn't even care.
[314:06.38]I'm about to just go grenade only in this fucking game.
[314:10.41]Seriously.
[314:18.87]What?
[314:19.15]There was another zipline course.
[314:25.03]Get the fuck out of this.
[314:31.38]Alright, I'm there.
[314:33.04]I'm here.
[314:33.46]I'm ready to party.
[314:35.90]You perfectly outlined him.
[314:37.40]I was just shooting at random.
[314:40.44]They, like, know because of the gunshots, but they don't know where.
[314:44.58]I'm going to hit the chain link fence if I shoot this guy.
[314:46.29]I'm going to try to sneak up to the guy on top that I marked.
[314:59.57]I'm gonna go ahead and call in a roster ally.
[315:03.01]Just so that if we both go down, there's still a chance we can get picked back up.
[315:11.03]I'm never going to Montana after watching this.
[315:14.44]Probably a bad place to go.
[315:15.34]This guy's like right here.
[315:21.04]That was supposed to be a stealth attack.
[315:23.76]Well, the whole camp is now coming.
[315:27.15]He took his gun.
[315:30.46]He just ate his gun.
[315:30.90]Now they're killing the dog.
[315:35.39]I missed.
[315:36.57]Okay, arrows are gone.
[315:38.03]Good.
[315:38.61]What the fuck is this guy?
[315:40.67]What?
[315:44.20]I'm down.
[315:50.64]So that was supposed to be a stealth kill and he ate his gun and the whole camp is on him.
[315:55.41]Yeah.
[315:56.33]That guy threw his gun 20 feet in the air.
[316:05.17]I think it may be over.
[316:06.63]There's a mortar here.
[316:07.23]There's one guy still down here.
[316:14.16]Where is he?
[316:14.58]He's got a rocket launcher.
[316:16.96]He had so much time.
[316:26.24]It's harder than it looks.
[316:27.30]Trust me.
[316:29.85]I can fucking promise you it's way harder than it looks.
[316:32.77]What?
[316:33.05]Sniping?
[316:33.63]Yes.
[316:43.38]Okay.
[316:44.94]Well, Boomer, you weren't really what I was hoping for.
[316:50.44]But yet, here we are.
[316:52.54]So now what?
[316:55.23]I guess we find out what he's been hiding in his secret stash.
[317:02.17]Good job.
[317:02.63]Real strong.
[317:03.13]Nice muscles.
[317:08.31]There's somebody down here, probably.
[317:09.48]Wait, this is where he was holding everybody, right?
[317:16.43]Apparently there's other people in here.
[317:23.27]Maybe not.
[317:24.11]Yeah, there are people here.
[317:26.81]A lot of people.
[317:27.41]Wow, this is a good enough time.
[317:28.39]This is why you tag things.
[317:29.61]And this is why you go like this.
[317:31.41]That guy's got armor?
[317:43.33]Yes, he does.
[317:46.72]Okay, that's how it's gonna be.
[317:50.24]Is that it?
[317:51.83]Good use of explosives.
[317:52.87]That was some nice planning there.
[317:54.87]Might as well.
[317:56.99]I know.
[317:57.25]I was just saying good job.
[317:59.07]Good work.
[318:01.67]Okay.
[318:02.23]Money, money, money.
[318:07.42]Music's getting louder.
[318:08.24]Voice is getting louder.
[318:18.80]Okay, who's on the other side more baddies maybe I would assume What would you be stashing behind four of these doors Money really internet maybe internet access.
[318:36.05]Yeah, maybe the Internet's back here.
[318:38.37]Oh
[318:42.08]Yeah, I'll be your cameraman.
[318:43.92]I'm going in as the police officer behind the scenes Okay, like the the documentarian Documentary nice.
[318:55.21]I like it.
[318:56.05]Is that it?
[318:57.99]I'm doing the machinima right now.
[318:59.75]Yeah That guy died instantly that guy's a little I'm gonna take that thing cuz look at this look at this.
[319:07.98]Why wouldn't you?
[319:14.21]Why would you not?
[319:16.55]Grenade.
[319:23.85]Ooh, good grenade.
[319:27.97]How is he still didn't die?
[319:30.33]These guys have a ton of armor.
[319:33.19]Careful.
[319:34.10]Oh, watch out.
[319:39.90]I don't want to shoot you in the head.
[319:42.52]Watch out.
[319:42.78]Oh, hi.
[319:45.89]Nice, nice.
[319:48.67]Double kill.
[319:51.13]Don't shoot the civilian.
[319:52.53]Oh, okay.
[319:56.21]Release them.
[319:56.67]That's definitely a switch.
[320:00.04]Looks like it.
[320:00.80]Maybe it opens later.
[320:02.50]That's fine.
[320:06.22]Anything down there?
[320:07.06]No?
[320:15.18]Nothing I thought look at all the stuff that was I thought I was a bunch of money is this crumpled up flowers Just a bunch of dead people, you know, this is where they come have all their fun experiments.
[320:31.98]Here we go What's me how would you friends from the helicopter how would you not know this by now I
[320:44.56]Like, you still haven't figured out that I'm me?
[320:47.64]She's gone mad from the torture.
[320:49.56]Maybe.
[320:50.68]She just isn't thinking straight.
[320:57.63]Oh, she's drunk.
[321:03.31]Okay, that makes sense.
[321:06.02]A hat and plaid really changes somebody.
[321:34.11]Easy.
[322:05.11]He's gonna stab somebody.
[322:06.91]That knife.
[322:07.99]That knife's gonna be used in a second.
[322:12.03]Is there an eagle in this room?
[322:15.53]The eagle is in our hearts.
[322:16.39]Okay, well, the subtitles there were a little weird.
[322:20.07]We're gonna get him out, and then we are gonna fucking burn.
[322:23.27]Okay.
[322:36.24]How do you burn a giant metal bunker, though?
[322:38.78]Good question.
[322:40.48]I don't think that you do, really.
[322:45.65]Well, I'm assuming she can't die.
[322:50.71]I mean, if she dies, the mission's over.
[322:52.49]But good thing for you to figure that out.
[322:54.05]It's okay.
[322:56.81]Testing the waters.
[323:00.81]People on the cameras.
[323:03.39]A4, C4, B3.
[323:06.13]Speaking of matrix code.
[323:08.73]Look it, it's on the monitor.
[323:09.57]No, remember all the prisoners.
[323:11.35]This is kind of the same place though.
[323:15.74]Watch out, watch out.
[323:16.94]There's like a million people around that corner.
[323:46.28]teamwork Reload This became a very serious mission.
[323:53.75]This is a much more doable mission in the plane one.
[323:56.55]Yeah, all right.
[323:57.29]I'll watch I'll watch They're all good.
[324:00.41]It's almost guaranteed Yeah, anytime something says that usually that is it done I think you might be going the other way.
[324:08.36]Yeah, I Don't want to die
[324:15.59]Please don't kill me.
[324:18.19]That's two.
[324:19.43]One more?
[324:22.09]Okay, so I was kind of going the right way.
[324:24.95]LMG easy mode.
[324:26.11]Good.
[324:26.35]It's about time.
[324:27.87]Oh, no.
[324:28.35]This is a parkour.
[324:28.99]This is going to jump around and grab stuff.
[324:32.70]Oh, no.
[324:33.22]Oh, just to go there.
[324:46.95]Oh.
[324:48.05]Got there.
[324:50.33]I thought that was going to be very complicated.
[324:52.32]Which is the way they're going.
[325:07.14]From their perspective, would we be freeing the people or would we be stealing the people?
[325:10.90]You know what I mean?
[325:12.06]Like if they view it as... Oh, that guy had too much stuff.
[325:18.18]Let's hang out for a sec.
[325:18.90]I'm almost out of ammo for this thing.
[325:29.57]But I do like it, so I want to hold onto it as long as I can.
[325:32.58]Destroy the consoles.
[325:34.50]A couple more.
[325:51.56]What the fuck was that?
[325:53.46]That's why I said back up, because I was going to put an explosive down.
[325:55.80]I killed, like, four people at once.
[325:57.95]Well, you said back up, and then you went, woohoo!
[326:00.93]Yeah, because I was trying to get a... I did go woohoo.
[326:04.13]You're right.
[326:10.14]This guy's just hiding behind the... What a camper.
[326:15.79]Where do we go?
[326:18.93]This thing has no bullets.
[326:22.59]Oh, now the part you were thinking of happens.
[326:24.27]Oh, no.
[326:24.67]Now we have to do this shit.
[326:28.13]Yeah, so you just... You go way... You go way ahead of me because we're going to get locked together here.
[326:36.17]Uh...
[326:37.07]From here, we gotta go to the right up there.
[326:39.97]We have to get to that switch, right?
[326:41.31]Or is that... Aha!
[326:43.79]Puzzle!
[326:44.61]Puzzling.
[326:45.11]Good puzzles.
[326:48.35]I feel like I'm playing Dying Light.
[326:51.34]We love that game.
[327:10.09]Uh, person.
[327:12.30]There is.
[327:12.94]Yep.
[327:13.48]I feel like I'm in Star Wars.
[327:14.86]I love that movie.
[327:16.96]You know when Leia, like, swings across with Luke in her arms?
[327:20.54]Remember that part?
[327:21.52]I do, but yeah, we gotta go.
[327:23.36]How do we get over there?
[327:24.16]I don't know.
[327:24.76]Up?
[327:25.18]Up there.
[327:25.42]Is there a grapple?
[327:26.46]Puzzle.
[327:29.83]I'm gonna fall.
[327:33.93]Hold me.
[327:35.49]Where do we go now?
[327:36.63]I'm in your way.
[327:37.39]Across?
[327:38.55]Across.
[327:44.86]Shoot the fuel tanks That's a fuel tank that spooked me spook me a bit That watch out fuel tanks are everywhere are they yeah watch out get out of the room I
[328:12.35]Come back here.
[328:19.42]Destroy Blitz containers.
[328:21.88]I mean, those are them, right?
[328:25.44]Oh, okay.
[328:26.06]We need to do some communication here.
[328:28.68]Okay.
[328:29.64]There's a bad guy in the room.
[328:30.96]I killed him.
[328:31.91]Alright, I'm going to go through the escape mark door.
[328:33.63]I'm heading up the stairs right now.
[328:34.97]Watch out for the haunted house.
[328:39.11]Moving quick.
[328:39.65]Moving fast.
[328:40.61]There are more multiple bogeys in this room.
[328:59.92]Panels.
[329:01.02]Touch the panels.
[329:01.90]Open the panels.
[329:05.22]Override panel.
[329:06.20]Whoa!
[329:07.02]Everything's exploding.
[329:07.84]Not good.
[329:17.16]I need healing.
[329:18.00]Wrong button.
[329:19.54]Oh, me too.
[329:20.08]Heal.
[329:20.34]Okay.
[329:21.46]I'm down.
[329:22.46]Don't die.
[329:25.80]Get up.
[329:26.38]Thank you.
[329:27.92]Oh, I'm so close to dead.
[329:29.80]Scary, scary noise.
[329:31.10]Up top, somehow.
[329:31.96]Survive.
[329:35.74]How is... No jokes here.
[329:39.52]What am I thinking?
[329:40.60]No.
[329:41.10]What are you thinking?
[329:42.30]Alright, we have to go up the ladders.
[329:43.50]How do we get up the ladders?
[329:44.58]I...
[329:48.41]Can we jump?
[329:49.85]Oh, they just opened the thing.
[329:50.75]They're gonna lower the ladders, probably.
[329:53.92]They're all up there.
[329:55.32]I don't even see what the fuck is going on.
[329:56.70]Oh, I see.
[329:59.60]Hook up.
[330:00.84]Grapple!
[330:04.16]Get us outta here!
[330:06.12]Yeah, no joking.
[330:08.18]No joking allowed for this mission.
[330:09.90]This is serious only.
[330:11.79]That was a very long firefight.
[330:13.69]I wouldn't want to start from the beginning of that.
[330:23.12]Let's go get a beer.
[330:37.98]And with that, that's gonna be it for me for tonight.
[330:43.60]Yeah.
[330:43.74]I need to get ready for tomorrow.
[330:46.10]Yeah.
[330:52.01]We've got a long day tomorrow.
[330:53.45]I'm going to have a hangover tomorrow after all this beer they're giving me.
[330:58.53]Cheers to that.
[330:59.83]That was a hell of a job.
[331:06.50]Thanks, Farrah.
[331:08.84]The way I see it, you're the one in charge now.
[331:13.12]And if you ever need anything, just let me know.
[331:22.13]What is tomorrow?
[331:22.71]You'll see.
[331:26.13]A stream.
[331:26.99]He's gonna cosplay as Joseph.
[331:28.67]I'm just gonna turn on my stream and slick my hair back and just do this.
[331:33.74]Oh, shirtless with all your tats?
[331:56.84]John was not born a monster.
[332:01.27]He was just a child when our family was torn apart.
[332:04.55]This is making me very much empathize with the main villain.
[332:08.37]I feel like maybe he's not so bad.
[332:10.77]Maybe he's just a person like me, misunderstood.
[332:16.24]Who just happens to really like orange-tinted aviators.
[332:19.66]I don't know, man.
[332:21.18]This guy was eating popcorn while people were getting tortured down in the basement.
[332:23.92]I'm not sure I agree with that one.
[332:27.17]But he rescued John and he nursed him back to health.
[332:29.65]And he was his brother.
[332:31.51]But he was my brother.
[332:33.55]Family first, man.
[332:35.30]And those responsible for his death will be punished.
[332:40.88]I'll send twice as many planes as before.
[332:43.16]I'm not the one.
[332:43.76]I didn't shoot him.
[332:45.76]He will be punished.
[332:46.88]I will send four times as many helicopters and buses and planes.
[332:55.05]You're going to be really mad at the missiles that come dropping down on every road in this game.
[332:59.68]I just want to see what guns they gave us.
[333:07.71]They claimed there were unlocks.
[333:10.01]Yeah, I got like all the melee weapons.
[333:14.65]What was this new?
[333:15.21]There is a new larger .44 Magnum.
[333:18.31]Ooh, I don't have that one.
[333:21.46]I don't have that one.
[333:22.44]I don't have that one.
[333:23.60]I don't have that one.
[333:24.30]Like, three new rifles?
[333:26.44]Two new rifles?
[333:28.30]Ooh, this one's kind of hot.
[333:31.08]And a new sniper.
[333:34.15]That's cool.
[333:35.09]What is this thing?
[333:36.87]What is a magnopulsar?
[333:39.89]Do you see this thing all the way to the right?
[333:41.51]It appears to be some kind of energy gun.
[333:44.21]Is this the joke gun that's in the game?
[333:45.53]It's like the portal gun or something?
[333:47.35]Probably is the portal gun.
[333:48.49]Or at least shoots just a ball of fire.
[333:50.59]If I had to guess.
[333:54.17]Okay.
[333:54.97]Well.
[334:01.68]That's it for tonight.
[334:05.12]And probably I would assume that's it for Far Cry 5, right?
[334:08.78]Yeah, that's the end of Far Cry 5.
[334:10.98]We completed a story thing.
[334:13.58]What else do you want?
[334:14.36]We did all the funny.
[334:17.64]There was no more... There was no more fun things.
[334:20.16]Well, no, that's not true.
[334:21.10]There was probably a few other things we could have done, but... The only thing we have left is the helicopter with the door.
[334:28.37]And story missions, but... Yeah.
[334:30.35]It's getting a little late.
[334:31.97]We need to get some sleep.
[334:32.55]Yeah.
[334:33.81]But... Thanks for playing.
[334:35.71]It's Alex.
[334:36.25]Everybody say goodbye.
[334:37.51]Bye, Italics Extreme.
[334:38.48]Always a pleasure.
[334:39.18]Goodbye.
[334:39.86]Good night.
[334:41.90]Have fun tomorrow with the special cosplay stream.
[334:46.14]Special cosplay stream.
[334:48.44]Thank you.
[334:50.26]Good night, Italics.
[334:51.14]Goodbye.
[334:54.33]He's gone.
[334:56.35]Yes, before we go, tomorrow is going to be a stream at probably around probably like 6.30, 7 o'clock.
[335:08.58]The normal starting time, probably.
[335:13.09]But it's a stream that... It's gonna be a stream.
[335:19.77]See you there tomorrow.
[335:22.35]Same time, same place.
[335:25.05]Broadcast tomorrow.
[335:28.13]Have a good rest of your night, everybody, and let's do the credits.
[335:31.91]If you just stick around for this, have a good rest of your night.
[335:37.49]So let's thank all the subs and resubs that happened tonight.

[338:22.78]Let's get to the bits.
[338:26.14]Let's go back here.
[338:27.02]This is a pretty long stream.
[338:29.87]Let's get the actual, actual outro here.
[338:36.09]You'll learn to read someday.
[338:38.57]Someday, maybe I'll learn.
[338:39.39]Let's go back here from way earlier.
[338:43.57]Targe Tape, thanks for the 25 cents.
[338:46.69]Mr. 985, please say my name correctly.
[338:49.62]Targe Tape.
[338:51.75]Is that wrong?
[338:53.47]Target tape?
[338:55.27]Thank you, though.
[338:56.95]Uh, Frickster.
[338:58.05]Thanks for the $1.
[338:58.88]My name didn't show up on the credits last stream, so now I'm paying to give you... I'm paying you to give me attention.
[339:05.16]Love you, bud.
[339:07.20]Is doing a fishing stream?
[339:08.88]Well... Well, I'm not gonna fish.
[339:12.41]I ain't doing it.
[339:14.81]No fishing for me.
[339:18.95]After hearing about the tea, I was intrigued.
[339:20.07]After hearing about the tea.
[339:21.22]Like the pee?
[339:21.58]Thanks, man.
[339:43.72]That was one of my first, like, 40 videos or something, wasn't it?
[339:48.54]A long time ago.
[339:52.30]We've ruined that backyard, by the way.
[339:56.76]That was so much sugar and cake and... It was awful.
[340:03.47]But thank you to LightningRider again.
[340:07.05]Thank you TargeTape again.
[340:08.09]I meant to say my name.
[340:09.85]TargeTape.
[340:11.91]I think.
[340:13.66]Pina Chip, thanks for the $1.
[340:14.76]They say C. Thank you.
[340:18.63]FlubbaGut, thanks for the $3.
[340:19.37]Hi, Jeremiah.
[340:20.15]Would like to take the time to thank you for the past week.
[340:21.95]I've been bedridden and kept up late with a terrible virus.
[340:25.37]And the main highlight of the constant spluttering is that I am conscious enough to watch your streams past midnight.
[340:31.51]Your content always puts a smile on my face.
[340:33.02]Whether I want to die or I'm not quite at that stage, stay awesome.
[340:35.98]I'm looking forward to all the streams ahead.
[340:38.04]Thank you, FlubbaGut.
[340:41.94]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[340:44.47]Get well soon.
[340:45.81]Hopefully you can get over that virus in the next couple of days.
[340:52.37]I did.
[340:53.89]Remember when the grenade landed in front of me and I screamed?
[340:59.40]That was six hours ago, right?
[341:01.84]Thank you.
[341:03.60]As always.
[341:12.11]Swift Bagel, thanks for the $1.50 here.
[341:13.67]You can get Herc the co-op character from Far Cry 4 as a companion.
[341:20.40]I don't really know the significance of that because I didn't really play that much Far Cry 4.
[341:25.06]The only Far Cry 4 I ever played is when me and Italics played it.
[341:29.16]By the way, I don't know what he's doing here, but let's just take a look and see what his deal is.
[341:35.23]I don't know.
[341:35.67]I think he killed me.
[341:38.97]I'm just curious of what he's doing here.
[341:42.24]Watch this.
[341:43.90]I'm gonna scare the shit out of him.
[341:46.02]He thinks like he's just having fun just talking in the stream and just I'm gonna go up and just throw like a fucking knife in his head.
[341:52.02]Yeah, see?
[341:54.14]Right now he's like, oh, whatever.
[341:55.30]He's like doing bits.
[341:56.76]He's so fucked.
[342:01.02]I'm gonna stand still and like let me know like what he does.
[342:06.16]He's gonna just think that nothing's gonna happen and I'm gonna freak out.
[342:17.67]I need to fucking... Okay, hold on.
[342:21.18]He has no fucking idea.
[342:28.86]Alright, back to it.
[342:45.07]He already saw me?
[342:47.31]Did he, though?
[342:47.81]I don't think he did.
[342:52.36]But, thank you.
[342:54.20]Uh, thank you Spreo for the one dollar.
[342:56.54]Fucker got me, is what he says.
[342:58.70]Thank you.
[343:00.86]Uh, Kudad, or Cowdad, thank you for the ten dollars earlier.
[343:04.80]Appreciate that.
[343:07.17]Spreo, again, thanks for the one dollar.
[343:08.47]Stream experiences quantum death on stream.
[343:14.92]Thanks, dude.
[343:15.42]I wish I had more to say when people say things like that.
[343:17.70]But all I can say is thanks.
[343:18.70]I... I am... Sometimes, you know, I'm surprised a lot of times
[343:45.48]I just hope you guys are having fun.
[343:50.13]If you're not having fun, then I probably, I'm probably not either.
[343:54.71]So.
[343:55.83]It's pretty symbiotic in that way.
[344:00.21]Ruined.
[344:04.36]Talix, he's like, hold on.
[344:05.56]This is like more interesting.
[344:06.94]You know what I mean?
[344:08.30]Like, let's just see what he's doing.
[344:12.74]Uh, thank you though, Kali.
[344:15.01]Thank you, Savior of the Dreaming Dead for the 25 cents.
[344:17.83]Shout out to the King Con and Barbecue Show.
[344:20.73]The band keeps muting on the radio.
[344:24.06]Oh, is that one of the songs?
[344:28.00]Ubery, thanks for the $1.
[344:29.20]Jerma, could you please ask Italics why he looks like Matt Damon?
[344:31.58]Oh, I already got that one.
[344:33.40]Yeah, he heard it.
[344:35.38]Thank you, Kent JPG for the 50 cents.
[344:38.97]Penny Kettle, thanks for the 55 cents.
[344:40.65]Give us Otto's Big Adventure 3.
[344:42.03]Complete the trilogy for us, please.
[344:44.09]If it does not come out in 2018, I will do something drastic.
[344:48.13]Last connection.
[344:49.29]Fun's over.
[344:52.37]Maybe.
[344:52.75]Maybe you'll see it one day on stream.
[344:54.23]Maybe I'll just take Otto for a walk and stream it.
[344:59.52]Thank you to Techno Toast for the 75 cents.
[345:01.90]Local streamer fakes helicopter horns for views.
[345:04.34]Live on stream.
[345:07.28]I didn't fake anything.
[345:09.93]Hey Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[345:12.61]Professor Thaddeus Bonkers told me the two alternate Garfields you mentioned last stream appeared due to a dimensional rift.
[345:19.69]He called it the Garfield Reality Pulse.
[345:22.02]It stands for Massive Garfield RP.
[345:23.78]The Garfield RP is going to go off as soon as you start the Garfield card stream.
[345:27.52]Your chat will be transformed into different versions of Garfield.
[345:29.56]Get ready to remember the Garfield card apocalypse is coming.
[345:31.90]Alright, thanks.
[345:35.67]Das Pocky, thanks for the 25 cents.
[345:37.75]When are we going to move on from the shitty Garfield memes and accept the superior Calvin and Hobbes memes?
[345:42.45]Also, in case you forgot, it's poachy.
[345:44.07]Fuck.
[345:44.25]Fuck.
[345:48.40]Zmanreal78 thanks for the five dollars kill italics before he kills you that's usually He hates my bits.
[345:55.43]No, I don't they just there's another one coming up here.
[345:58.25]That's very long It's the paragraph again.
[346:01.35]It's just Garfield the paragraph writer Let's see what it says in a minute here Thank you Zman appreciate it.
[346:09.31]Usually I do kill attacks before he kills me unintentionally though.
[346:12.06]Oh
[346:13.47]Yeah.
[346:13.79]Full of broken promises, this guy.
[346:14.59]But thank you, Hawkeye, of mine, for the $5.
[346:15.83]I can't believe Etalgex landed that plane.
[346:17.73]PogChamp.

[346:43.08]No, they didn't.
[346:44.04]Sorry.
[346:46.84]Garfield the Monday Killer for 25 cents.
[346:48.79]Hell, let's see what it says.
[346:49.71]Oh man, German Saturday is the big day.
[346:51.25]It's my very first date.
[346:52.91]She really wanted to go to see a movie, but first I warned her that the German 95 said not to do that.
[346:57.59]She asked me who that was.
[346:58.61]The guy who beat Dark Souls on stream, I said.
[347:00.79]She said to me blankly as I looked at her unexpectedly.
[347:03.42]There was a long, awkward silence, and I realized I left my laugh track back at Hob's house.
[347:07.18]Anyways, what movies would you suggest us watching, and what can an orange cat do to make it special?
[347:12.46]watch your own movie and point every time you're on screen and be like that's me isn't that cool I'm in that movie that was in the theaters smelly boy 11 thanks for the one dollar he he wee wee pp thank you d class b thanks for the 25 cents invest in band-aids financial support incoming

[347:43.65]Some kind of emote, maybe?
[347:45.83]Reaper500, thanks for the $1.
[347:46.55]Believe the Tower of Bia.
[347:47.25]Believe the power... Believe the power of Bia.

[347:50.37]Believe the power of the Bia.
[347:58.42]Thanks, dude.
[347:58.82]Thank you, Zmanreal78 for the two bucks again.
[348:01.17]You win, Italics loses.
[348:02.25]I know, I told you.
[348:04.19]The rats far encompass the crabs.
[348:08.03]Are you kidding me?
[348:08.49]You know how many crabs there are on Earth versus how many rats there are on Earth?
[348:14.61]There are hundreds of millions of rats, and there's probably like 72,000 crabs on Earth.
[348:20.24]It's way... The ratio's not even close.
[348:26.17]Thank you, Bang9c9 for the 29 cents.
[348:28.39]Great stream, guys.
[348:29.50]Thank you.
[348:30.84]Thank you, Bang.
[348:36.96]Stop.
[348:37.68]Not this again.
[348:38.68]Have you seen the tiny little crabs?
[348:43.33]Yeah, but that's just CG.
[348:47.33]Not even real.

[349:17.14]No, it's just been six hours and I'm tired.
[349:19.64]And I gotta get up early tomorrow.
[349:21.66]I have to prepare some things.
[349:24.66]But, yeah, thank you, dude.
[349:27.08]Starkiller2010X, thanks for the $1.
[349:29.72]Hey, Jermis, this chat is important to the detective game thing you are going to do.
[349:33.94]Can you put chat on screen when you do it?
[349:36.48]So when I put the full stream on the archive channel or if it back edits at YouTube, people can see the chat too.
[349:40.92]If you can't or don't want to, I can figure out something else.
[349:44.76]Um...
[349:47.44]I mean, maybe, but I hate having chat on the screen.
[349:54.04]I think, just personally, I know that some streams require being able to see it.
[349:59.16]But I feel like it just takes up unneeded real estate on the screen.
[350:05.04]Because just in a general stream, the chat is there and the chat is on the screen at the same time.
[350:09.09]It's kind of just like a mirror.
[350:11.67]But I might make an exception for this.
[350:16.33]We're not quite there yet, though, because something else came up that I wanted to do.
[350:19.66]This coming tomorrow.
[350:21.62]So, again, let me just speak proper actual words.
[350:28.59]Let me reiterate this one more time.
[350:30.03]Tomorrow is not the detective stream.
[350:32.57]Something else is tomorrow.
[350:34.09]The detective stream is going to happen next week, probably...
[350:37.73]I don't know.
[350:38.09]I mean, PAX East is next week too, so I gotta finagle something.
[350:41.81]Might do Tuesday, might do Wednesday, or I might just save it and do it the week after that, after PAX.
[350:48.34]I don't know.
[350:48.84]We'll see.
[350:50.10]It's just ready to go pretty much.
[350:51.38]I just need to get a few things situated for it.
[350:54.14]But something else is taking its place tomorrow.
[351:00.70]No, I'm not trying to fake you out.
[351:01.96]It actually is not happening tomorrow.
[351:04.88]Do you have PAX tickets yet?
[351:06.02]No.
[351:08.22]Thank you to Topac for the 10 bucks.
[351:11.32]The sixth sick chic, sixth sheeps sick.
[351:18.06]I nailed it.
[351:19.20]Thanks dude.
[351:20.32]Fred Flintstone for the $1, pee pee poo poo, rare pepe feels good man.
[351:25.44]Thank you dude.
[351:26.46]Das Pochi.
[351:29.70]Das Pochi for the 25 cents, twice 50 cents.
[351:32.35]I bought more bits, stop me from spending my money.
[351:37.14]I will, because you're the last bit here, and we're gonna end the stream.
[351:42.12]This is a great soundboard.
[351:45.40]Actual... What are you talking about?
[351:47.19]Oh, oh.
[351:47.85]Because I'm... Oh, you're not laughing at me like that.
[351:49.49]Okay.
[351:54.97]Hey, Topek, thanks for the $1.
[351:58.45]No.
[351:58.99]Yes.
[352:00.50]This whole game we've been playing is about yes.
[352:03.44]That's it.
[352:03.90]Good night, everybody.
[352:06.64]Be around tomorrow if you can.
[352:10.88]Hopefully it's worth it.
[352:12.86]I don't know.
[352:13.30]We'll find out.
[352:15.52]Take care, everybody.
[352:16.66]See you tomorrow.
[352:17.56]Good night.
[352:33.42]Well, I think this is like a... I think this... Okay, I'm not going to skip through this one.
[352:38.32]Hey, Jerma, thank you for always being there for all of us in chat.
[352:41.06]You're a heck of a lot funnier than any comics I've starred in.
[352:44.00]I hope you never stop streaming.
[352:45.10]I got one more life in me, and hopefully you're still around when the time comes.
[352:50.29]My last seven lives were a doozy.
[352:51.63]I think it was a failed lab experiment.
[352:53.53]Thank you, Das Pochi, for the 25 cents.
[352:56.03]He hates Garfield.
[352:58.63]That's not true.
[352:59.85]Yeah, what?
[353:00.17]That is true.
[353:01.03]I hate Garfield.
[353:05.62]Garfield sucks.
[353:08.64]Not this Garfield.
[353:10.72]The other Garfield.
[353:11.40]We talked about an entire stream of how much Garfield sucks.
[353:15.57]We spent a whole stream on it.
[353:20.41]Garfield the Monday Killer unsubbed?
[353:24.97]Why?
[353:26.43]I told you it wasn't even you.
[353:28.80]The most heartwarming Garfield RP got deleted.
[353:35.31]No, I read it and it was very nice and I really appreciate it, honestly.
[353:42.40]Das Pochi, thanks for the 25 cents.
[353:43.62]What about Calvin and Hobbes?
[353:44.92]Calvin and Hobbes is one of the greatest comic books ever made of all time.
[353:49.49]Santor the Christian Demon.
[353:53.39]Santor the Christmas Demon, thanks for the $1.
[353:55.43]Wish me a happy birthday or I'll pillage a small Canadian village.
[353:58.95]Happy birthday, Santor the Christmas Demon.
[354:01.48]Don't do that.
[354:04.65]And with that, see you tomorrow.
[354:07.55]Talk to you soon.
[354:09.06]Bye bye.
[354:10.66]Ta ta for now.
