[00:08.66]Hey, yo, what's going on, everybody?
[00:10.54]Jerma here with Basecamp Fortress 2, Monday's edition.
[00:14.28]See if I can't hop over and kill this scout from behind to get my first disguise with the Eternal Reward.
[00:23.49]Oh my god, I'm burping and stabbing.
[00:25.57]Stab!
[00:26.37]Stab!
[00:28.43]Playing as the spy, as you can tell.
[00:30.64]With the... I'll show you the loadout, because the loadout's actually a pretty important thing to talk about.
[00:34.76]The Diamondback, the Eternal Reward, and the Cloak and Dagger.
[00:39.08]This was picked by the livestream last night during my Choose Your Own... Choose Your Own Adventure polling livestream, which was actually pretty fun.
[00:48.87]I can't wait to do that again, because there's more interesting things that could be done.
[00:53.85]Well, let's get right into this here.
[00:55.01]Let's see if we can't... Give me another one.
[00:59.90]Oh, what?
[01:00.70]What?
[01:01.30]He died before I could kill him!
[01:04.14]Here's the good thing about the Cloak and Dagger.
[01:05.60]Ready?
[01:09.08]You can just sit here.
[01:10.96]I love it.
[01:11.28]I can make a sandwich.
[01:12.55]I can drink some Dr. Pepper.
[01:16.15]I had an opportunity to kill that pyro, but you know what?
[01:18.81]Sometimes Dr. Pepper's more important.
[01:21.47]How come I didn't... Oh, that's right.
[01:23.63]You can't run over ammo and get refilled.
[01:27.13]Yeah!
[01:28.73]Give me the health.
[01:29.99]Health, health, health.
[01:30.97]Maybe the doctor can heal me.
[01:32.69]Thank you, doctor.
[01:33.37]Why did I pick up that health?
[01:34.21]That was a bad move.
[01:35.99]So I want to talk about Dr. Pepper for a second, because it's kind of a split.
[01:39.89]It's a 50-50 split between people liking Dr. Pepper and people hating Dr. Pepper.
[01:45.07]Now, I'm one of those people that, as you can tell, absolutely loves the soft drink.
[01:48.97]And no, I'm not being paid by them.
[01:51.65]I wish I was.
[01:52.25]That would be pretty cool.
[01:53.65]If it was like, hey, Germo, we're Dr. Pepper.
[01:56.30]We know you love our drinks.
[01:57.80]We're going to give you a thousand cases of Dr. Pepper.
[02:01.40]I'd be like, shine me up, dude.
[02:03.98]But that's probably never going to happen, so that's wishful thinking.
[02:08.06]But if you think, a couple people in the comments said, Jerma, I hate Dr. Pepper, and I hope you don't hate me.
[02:13.47]No, no, no.
[02:14.25]I know that it's a very polarizing soda.
[02:18.57]And I've just been walking around in circles.
[02:20.81]No, I'm real.
[02:21.37]Look, see, I'm real.
[02:22.19]Nice job, Scout.
[02:27.53]Nice job.
[02:27.95]High five.
[02:29.25]If I had the high-five taunt, I would just use it right there.
[02:32.83]But, Dr. Pepper.
[02:34.17]Best drink ever, in my opinion.
[02:36.47]And we're gonna win this.
[02:37.30]They can't even get on the point.
[02:38.26]Damn.
[02:39.40]Maybe I should switch teams.
[02:42.26]No, I'll stay here for now.
[02:44.44]That's a... I just knocked this guy off.
[02:48.24]Gotcha!
[02:50.12]Come on, come on, come on.
[02:51.59]Come on, come on, come on.
[02:53.73]Are you seeing this?! !
[02:56.05]Heavy, heavy, heavy.
[02:57.83]Look at you!
[02:59.35]Face stab.
[03:05.04]Diamondback is not a great option here because there's no engineers really on the other team.
[03:09.50]I'll take that though.
[03:10.40]I'll take that.
[03:11.10]Let's try and hide somewhere.
[03:14.50]Whoa, is that real?
[03:16.46]Did I make it to my own spawn?
[03:18.08]I'm like, oh, I'm at their spawn.
[03:19.58]I'm not even... Yeah, I made it to my own spawn.
[03:22.54]Hey, look at that.
[03:23.36]My own spawn.
[03:24.23]Hey, spawn.
[03:26.20]One.
[03:26.92]Two.
[03:27.78]Three.
[03:29.06]So let's do another round.
[03:30.66]Alright, so we change maps.
[03:33.04]We end up on Nucleus.
[03:34.94]That's okay with me.
[03:37.48]I thought that guy was gonna jump down.
[03:39.28]I got him regardless.
[03:40.64]No!
[03:41.06]No!
[03:41.40]I just got a disguise!
[03:43.00]Oh!
[03:44.16]Bot and Buddy.
[03:46.40]Bonzi Buddy.
[03:47.32]Does anybody remember Bonzi Buddy?
[03:49.58]That's a very old internet term.
[03:51.40]I'm not sure if any of you guys might remember that.
[03:54.02]Old school, like 56k, 28.8k dial-up users will know who Bonzi Buddy is.
[04:02.88]Oh, there's a mini sentry now.
[04:04.52]Eternal Reward is gonna be not so good.
[04:10.39]But if I can... Come here, you.
[04:14.59]Oh, got him.
[04:17.81]He had crits, too.
[04:18.61]He's gonna be really mad.
[04:19.52]That is definitely a spy.
[04:20.98]I could probably guess.
[04:22.50]No, he probably thinks I'm a spy.
[04:24.68]Spies everywhere.
[04:25.60]Spy-ception.
[04:28.32]Alright, got my Gunslinger out.
[04:30.39]Let's do this, boys.
[04:31.41]Gunslinger.
[04:33.53]Hey, Scout.
[04:34.45]Come back here.
[04:35.01]I want to talk to you for a sec.
[04:37.11]Hey, Scout.
[04:37.57]I want to talk to you, too.
[04:39.47]Oh, okay.
[04:40.72]I was gonna say, that made a stabbing noise.
[04:44.68]That guy... It's okay, run.
[04:49.34]Everybody's chasing.
[04:50.66]Everybody's chasing.
[04:51.83]Jeez.
[04:55.93]I have an opportunity here.
[04:58.47]No, it's okay.
[05:00.22]Now I have an opportunity.
[05:01.92]Oh, this... No!
[05:03.66]Get the hells... Get the...
[05:05.47]Alright, both my fingers just almost went up my nose.
[05:10.91]I almost just freaked out.
[05:11.85]It almost went... That would have been bad.
[05:15.71]That would have not made for a good face cam video.
[05:18.31]Maybe it would have.
[05:19.07]You know, who knows?
[05:22.29]Alright, we're gonna get... That's a spy.
[05:25.15]At least I got his disguise.
[05:26.95]Let's go up.
[05:29.81]Hey, how are you?
[05:32.48]How's the wife and kids?
[05:35.73]Now would be a pretty good time to utilize the Diamondback.
[05:40.82]Never!
[05:41.14]I will never get it!
[05:42.34]I will never get a stair stab.
[05:44.14]I probably should have waited a little longer.
[05:50.53]The unwanted FX.
[05:53.95]The X edition.
[05:57.21]Let's go, let's respawn.
[06:01.11]I'm going to go down here this time because the left area is giving me a little bit of trouble.
[06:10.97]Nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody, nobody.
[06:14.43]Lot of people here.
[06:16.18]Here's the only chance I'm going to get.
[06:17.40]I don't want to put another sentry down.
[06:20.68]Wait till this pyro gets out of here.
[06:23.02]I'm doing a whole lot of sitting still here.
[06:26.30]Here it is.
[06:27.36]Three in a row right here.
[06:32.84]Three!
[06:36.61]Now, here's the question.
[06:37.59]Can I get... Oh!
[06:41.41]I thought that was a sticky from the other team.
[06:45.23]Let me get... Oh, I wanted to get that.
[06:47.85]Hi, how are you?
[06:48.83]Yeah, I'm probably disguised as you.
[06:50.65]Totally, yeah, I am.
[06:52.17]Nah, there's nothing I can do.
[06:53.53]Nothing I can do.
[06:54.39]Try and make the jump.
[06:55.71]Make the jump!
[06:56.99]Oh!
[06:57.85]Did he follow me?
[07:00.19]He did, he followed me.
[07:01.87]Oh!
[07:05.00]God, that was... A lot of luck in that came into play.
[07:08.98]I need the health now.
[07:13.65]Boy, oh boy.
[07:14.31]That is a spy scout.
[07:17.03]If I've ever seen one in my life.
[07:21.91]No, it's... I thought he just jumped to his own death.
[07:28.45]Does he have the... He might have the... No, he's not real.
[07:33.16]I just...
[07:36.31]You know what?
[07:36.73]I will accept that death because I got killed by Marlon Brando 57.
[07:41.37]Marlon Brando.
[07:42.65]M. Brando.
[07:46.53]I love that name.
[07:48.17]Now here's the funny thing.
[07:48.95]His name might be like Matt Brandio, not Marlon Brando, but that's what I saw.
[07:57.47]We better get him off of this.
[08:01.68]No!
[08:02.08]I can't go over there, Mini Sentry.
[08:03.32]Curse you!
[08:06.18]Curse you, Mini Sentry.
[08:09.72]They're gonna get it.
[08:12.22]I do not approve of that!
[08:17.30]Get this scout right here... No!
[08:19.67]Get him!
[08:23.89]Gonna get a crit.
[08:26.09]I'll take a crit.
[08:30.28]Somebody come out of the spawn!
[08:33.94]Let's end this.
[08:34.42]Oh, it's gonna end it right there.
[08:36.24]Might as well just use it up, because I'm gonna die anyways.
[08:38.38]And we got it anyways, right?
[08:39.71]Right?
[08:40.89]Right?
[08:43.17]Oh, yeah.
[08:45.33]Alright, that's gonna wrap it up.
[08:46.81]Thank you so much for watching, guys.
[08:48.09]I really appreciate it.
[08:49.56]And, uh, cheers.
[08:51.70]Cheers, mate.
[08:54.58]And see you guys all next time.
[08:55.50]And, of course, take care, everybody.
