[ve:61.1.100]

[00:49.06]Okay, that was kind of interesting.
[00:51.22]So I turned the stream on.
[00:53.18]Hold on, let me get some tea in my throat.
[00:57.78]Okay, so I turned on the stream.
[00:59.92]And I saw two people go, wait, whoa, live?
[01:04.00]And then three more people.
[01:06.82]And then like about 20 seconds went by.
[01:10.50]And like another person.
[01:12.38]So it was delayed going out to you guys.
[01:14.89]And then a tidal wave.
[01:17.29]Just showed up.
[01:18.72]That's kind of weird.
[01:21.62]How's it going?
[01:22.04]How you doing?
[01:26.60]Where's Nancy Drew?
[01:29.34]Well, I talked to her the other day.
[01:32.59]She's currently trying to figure out the mystery of the monster mummy.
[01:38.71]I was like, yeah, I wish I could be there, but I'm on this big case.
[01:41.53]I'm like, it's okay.
[01:42.11]We can wait for you.
[01:42.69]It's alright.
[01:45.61]that when she's done with that case which it could be that could be months hey can you give us a hint to the next horseman
[02:09.34]Are we going to start adding horsemen?
[02:10.66]Is that how this works?
[02:11.38]The four horsemen?
[02:13.54]Are we going to start adding like... And here's the sixth horseman!
[02:19.69]The seventh horseman.
[02:22.09]I'm not sure that biblically... That's not biblically accurate, sorry.
[02:29.73]You sound really high pitch.
[02:33.50]I shouldn't be.
[02:34.00]My throat's a little dry today, but...
[02:43.60]Did you see the candle on Steam?
[02:45.40]I actually have seen the candle on Steam.
[02:49.67]That's I, I can't wait.
[03:00.55]Early.
[03:00.79]Yeah.
[03:01.15]I wanted to be a little early today.
[03:04.15]We're not playing with the four horsemen until a couple hours from now.
[03:10.96]Four o'clock.
[03:13.11]I wanted to play this dig in a hole game.
[03:14.64]I keep seeing it.
[03:16.56]This game was made for me.
[03:20.34]What is the goal of this game?
[03:21.44]You just have to dig a hole in the ground.
[03:25.71]There's no complex storyline.
[03:27.07]There's nothing to pay.
[03:27.67]The only thing to pay attention to is just dig into the ground.
[03:31.99]It's perfect.
[03:37.44]I don't have to worry about what some, I don't know, what some fucking idiot across the table was trying to tell me.
[03:42.20]Like, I don't know.
[03:43.46]Shut up.
[03:45.10]I got a hole to dig.
[03:52.29]You just lost 3,000 viewers.
[03:53.33]Now wake up and bring them back, please.
[03:57.37]This is scared Otto.
[03:59.07]It's okay.
[03:59.59]I'm sorry.
[04:01.20]He just was like, what are you doing?
[04:02.64]He just looked at me.
[04:03.18]He's like, what's going on?
[04:05.28]Everything's fine.
[04:05.80]It's okay.
[04:13.14]What's your favorite poet?
[04:16.30]Uh, Robert Frost.
[04:17.26]That's an easy one.
[04:17.83]Alright.
[04:21.09]We're going to play digging a hole.
[04:25.21]Can you see it yet?
[04:27.45]Now you can.
[04:28.05]Okay.
[04:30.27]Well, let me, let me move some stuff around.
[04:31.61]Give me one sec.
[04:43.31]Oh, shit.
[04:43.87]I should run an ad, shouldn't I?
[04:44.83]Yeah, alright, alright.
[04:47.60]Okay, let me run ads.
[04:48.76]I'm not quite ready.
[04:50.80]Let's get rid of the pre-rolls.
[04:52.40]We're not quite ready yet.
[04:53.78]Hey, look at this.
[04:55.29]I'll be right back.
[06:09.45]Someone just said, he's only streaming now to show us ads.
[06:17.89]You're talking during the move.
[06:19.50]No, wait, you're talking during the previews.
[06:20.76]You're talking to her.
[06:21.82]Wait, it's okay to talk during the ads.
[06:23.34]Nevermind.
[06:24.56]I was just trying to tell you to be quiet during the ads, but I'm talking over them, but I'm not talking over them because it just deletes me.
[06:30.60]No one can even hear.
[06:31.12]There's like how many, what a couple thousand people, maybe they can hear what I'm saying.
[06:52.72]I've been looking forward to playing this.
[06:53.88]Alright, one more minute.
[06:57.25]I mean, I'm pretty much situated.
[06:58.99]I can't even talk.
[06:59.49]I'm pretty much situated.
[07:02.00]And we'll get started.
[07:43.06]This game is fucking loud.
[07:44.47]Hold on.
[07:44.87]Let me turn this down.
[07:50.49]Okay, there we go.
[07:50.97]Alright, we've got 20 seconds before the ad is over.
[07:54.81]Pre-roll should be off for an hour, which is good.
[07:56.85]And then we can start the stream.
[08:00.30]Probably going to be live for a while today.
[08:04.92]This is going to be potentially kind of a long one.
[08:16.95]Hey, ad break is over.
[08:18.15]Your community is back.
[08:20.38]Hey, guys.
[08:23.28]Where did we leave off?
[08:25.14]Oh, that's right.
[08:26.24]I was about to dig a hole.
[08:27.20]Okay.
[08:48.70]I just got more ads.
[08:49.78]That's a lie.
[08:55.00]Only 10.
[08:55.80]Is that $10?
[08:56.88]That's $10.
[08:58.77]That's not a comma.
[08:59.47]That's a period.
[08:59.97]Okay.
[09:03.49]It's gold treasure in the garden.
[09:05.31]Cool.
[09:09.73]This is the one.
[09:10.32]Alright.
[09:14.48]Super Mega Digger 3000 Ultimate 2.0 Detector Set.
[09:21.47]explodes when that's not funny that's not humorous at all I just like the fact that they would put that on the label as a choking hazard is kind of humorous in a way alright so alright so I just have to get the treasure that's it easy okay I have a health bar and a battery bar can I do anything else
[09:50.24]No, I can't come over here and pick up the tongs, forget about the game, and start a hilarious improv barbecue routine.
[09:59.74]Here it comes, though.
[10:02.96]I'm not doing that.
[10:03.54]Alright, you just click and dig.
[10:05.58]That's it.
[10:09.40]That's it.
[10:09.64]I have a backpack.
[10:15.76]Do I have an energy bar?
[10:17.07]Can I go in my house?
[10:21.17]I'm like the little kid in the back of a car.
[10:27.45]Oh, sell ore?
[10:29.21]You can sell shit?
[10:30.05]Alright, this game could be pretty great.
[10:33.18]Upgrades.
[10:33.84]Alright, alright.
[10:34.46]We just gotta dig.
[10:35.18]Let's go.
[10:43.38]Is that an ore?
[10:45.80]Dude, I found a stone.
[10:46.88]Okay, at this point I'd probably give up.
[10:50.61]I'd go to Home Depot and get all this shit and get this far.
[10:54.17]And realize that there's rice-a-roni in the pantry that I could make.
[10:57.89]And I would just go make that instead.
[11:00.77]Is there a rhyme or... Am I doing this wrong?
[11:02.71]Should I... Is there a correct way to... Oh, I do have a battery.
[11:10.59]Okay, I have a battery.
[11:12.09]How much is one stone worth?
[11:13.13]Let's find out.
[11:17.77]Battery is $1 to charge it.
[11:21.33]Dynamite's a hundred bucks?
[11:25.29]Alright, what do you sell stuff?
[11:27.90]I have two stones.
[11:28.80]It's one dollar for a stone.
[11:30.72]Alright, I got two bucks.
[11:34.30]Alright, this game is gonna be a lot of fun.
[11:41.00]Hey buddy, how was school today?
[11:51.84]Alright.
[11:52.32]At what point do you get in trouble when you're a kid?
[11:57.02]I would consider this to be in trouble.
[12:00.70]If mom or dad came out here and saw how deep this was, I think this is I'm in trouble.
[12:16.52]Can I get in here and like crouch?
[12:22.25]Oh, that's... I... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[12:25.41]The cake is a lie.
[12:26.39]The fuck are you doing?
[12:28.98]Why are you doing sayings from, like, 2006?
[12:31.52]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[12:37.38]I need to buy battery.
[12:39.26]Wait.
[12:39.68]No, I don't.
[12:49.00]What happens if I run completely out of battery?
[12:50.80]Is it bad?
[12:55.94]Oh, I just got coal.
[12:56.64]Nice.
[12:59.85]That's right.
[13:00.71]It explodes.
[13:03.53]Somebody didn't read the label.
[13:06.63]Okay.
[13:07.29]What the fuck?
[13:07.81]It went up a hundred percent in one minute.
[13:12.57]What's up with this?
[13:14.93]It was a dollar two seconds ago.
[13:19.89]That's okay.
[13:21.56]That's that's bullshit.
[13:29.55]You know, this is probably just a gigantic subversion.
[13:33.17]I probably should be digging over here.
[13:35.65]You know what I mean?
[13:36.37]Down here.
[13:37.83]Everybody's going to follow the X. Everyone's going to conform.
[13:42.49]I'm going to do the anti-conformity.
[13:47.57]Exactly.
[13:48.13]And there's a fucking diamond right there.
[13:50.19]Whatever that is.
[13:51.14]I don't, whatever this is, this is incredibly important.
[13:52.80]Whatever it is, it's worth fucking millions.
[13:54.04]Whatever it is.
[13:57.12]What is that?
[13:58.04]It's a gigantic diamond.
[14:06.47]Whatever.
[14:06.73]It's huge and blue.
[14:08.25]It's part of the wall.
[14:10.75]That's not.
[14:12.89]That's part of the wall.
[14:16.63]Is it though?
[14:18.72]That's the septic tank.
[14:27.02]Yeah, you got to get that company down here to tell you where like all the gas lines are.
[14:34.21]Yeah, contrary to what some of you might believe, you can't just go into a spot and just like take a pickaxe and just smush into the ground.
[14:41.40]You'll go... Gonna do it with safety in mind.
[14:49.27]I only have three dollars.
[14:56.93]Okay, it won't explode.
[14:59.65]As long as it stays blue.
[15:08.92]Alright, this is where I get nice and comfortable.
[15:11.30]I squat down.
[15:13.26]I just take a fucking dump in this hole.
[15:18.58]And then I get over here and I just start like kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick, kick.
[15:27.49]I got five bucks.
[15:28.13]What can I do?
[15:30.21]Shit.
[15:30.75]Okay.
[15:30.97]I need, I need to get $5 without running out of battery.
[15:42.64]Jerma, don't dig straight down.
[15:45.06]Don't you know what happens to you in Minecraft?
[15:46.92]You're going to have to speak up.
[15:49.58]I couldn't understand a fucking word you just said.
[15:53.02]Sorry, dude.
[15:54.84]I've been sick recently.
[15:56.45]You know, if you dig down straight down, you shouldn't do that in Minecraft.
[16:00.13]It's actually kind of similar.
[16:03.09]Now that you took a minute, I could fucking hear you.
[16:04.97]Thank you.
[16:18.48]I'm just making a hazard.
[16:27.97]Can you click and hold?
[16:28.73]I love this concept for a game.
[16:45.58]This is the kind of game that you think of making and you go, nah, no one's going to buy that.
[16:51.89]And then the one person that actually does do it sells a million copies, which I hope they did.
[16:57.51]So let that be a lesson to all you devs out there that are too good for lawn mowing simulations and place the tile on the ground simulator or
[17:14.69]smash the rock into the ground simulator open your horizons a little bit okay I can buy this better shovel so my shovel should be more radius did you read about TF2 source code going I did see that TF2 source code is now public or something what the s what sdk whatever it is does that mean that you can take the century and like make a new century or something
[17:43.83]Can like everything be changed?
[17:52.10]I don't- I'm kind- that kind of freaks me out a little.
[17:58.52]So people are going to be modding the game and creating like superheroes and shit.
[18:06.17]Like the engineer's gonna have a cape that lets him fly.
[18:08.13]I feel like you can already do that though.
[18:09.73]But the cape can be modeled in the game and function in the game?
[18:14.92]Why am I in here?
[18:20.76]Like, like Saxton Hale already exists, right?
[18:23.54]My inventory's full.
[18:24.44]Let me see.
[18:35.09]It's gonna be like those portal mods that are completely new game.
[18:41.52]I mean, that's real.
[18:44.30]Whatever people do with it, I'm sure it's going to be crazy.
[18:46.88]Is that Valve's way of saying, hey, everybody wants us to make Team Fortress 3, but you just do it.
[18:56.49]That kind of feels like that.
[19:05.40]Oh, I actually can almost get my whole body in here.
[19:10.18]Cold.
[19:12.62]What happens if I can't get out?
[19:16.05]Can you softlock?
[19:16.77]Can I get stuck in here?
[19:21.19]Honey!
[19:22.91]Honey, I need some help!
[19:27.63]Yeah, that is a look out the window on the phone with mom conversation about me.
[19:36.82]Yeah, I don't know.
[19:39.36]He's been really, really, his behavior has been bizarre.
[19:54.87]Ever since the Chiefs lost the Super Bowl, he's been digging straight down.
[20:10.16]Or destroyed?
[20:11.00]What?
[20:13.36]Why did I just break it?
[20:19.77]Do I have to be more careful?
[20:21.33]What the fuck is going on?
[20:28.71]Oh, my inventory is full.
[20:34.24]Can I tell you, though, that I was, you know, watching the game.
[20:38.92]And the Eagles are a great team.
[20:42.10]Obviously.
[20:43.58]Big fan of the Eagles.
[20:44.60]Big fan of the... I can't even start this one up.
[20:51.25]I can't start this one up.
[20:53.15]Because this is fucking... The whole thing is a lie.
[20:57.67]I can't even pretend.
[20:58.89]It's impossible.
[21:03.54]Battery's already low.
[21:12.14]Battery critical.
[21:13.02]Uh-oh.
[21:19.16]The edibles kick in yet?
[21:20.48]No, I'm fine.
[21:26.35]I want this next.
[21:27.57]Jetpack.
[21:36.19]I probably shouldn't go that far down without the jetpack.
[21:40.34]Or should I always make sure I have stairs?
[21:41.66]What if I just go sideways?
[21:42.60]I'm going this way.
[21:46.81]I swear to God, if like a skeleton zombie or something attacks me.
[21:51.31]They might even be monsters.
[21:52.87]I don't know.
[22:05.41]shit this thing sucks I need okay I'm doing a getting battery now oh I got iron that's it oh wrong table five bucks for one iron that's pretty good I'm good I'm I'm I'm cool with that
[22:34.15]Alright.
[22:34.51]Battery size increased.
[22:35.99]Wait, am I going to have enough money?
[22:36.89]Yeah.
[22:39.03]Now it's $4 to charge the battery.
[22:40.75]That's a lot.
[22:41.71]Okay.
[22:46.70]What's your favorite cigarette flavor?
[22:48.06]I have a shitload of battery now.
[23:08.50]Imagine if it was just this easy to find a... What?
[23:17.84]Where is it?
[23:23.96]Object detected.
[23:24.76]Wait, it's right here.
[23:29.36]Dinosaur bones?
[23:40.20]Get all this shit out of the way.
[23:41.32]Damn it.
[23:59.71]Alright.
[24:00.07]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[24:06.45]18 bucks.
[24:06.95]Oh my God.
[24:07.55]Okay.
[24:08.09]I got a lot of money now.
[24:11.82]Uh, jetpack.
[24:14.13]Consumes energy to use it.
[24:17.43]Lamp.
[24:17.75]What does this do?
[24:18.91]Lamps cannot be picked up again once placed.
[24:22.29]Used to destroy rocks and lava rocks.
[24:23.89]Can't destroy.
[24:24.47]Okay.
[24:26.88]I'm going in full charge.
[24:27.82]I got 12 bucks.
[24:29.24]Now I have a jetpack.
[24:32.36]This is just that Roblox tycoon game.
[24:40.47]Is Roblox becoming the new Simpsons of video games?
[24:47.55]Everything was made in Roblox first, apparently.
[24:52.70]Is the entirety of my streaming catalog on Roblox?
[24:57.29]As a playable experience?
[24:58.67]And did it happen a year before I started YouTube?
[25:00.87]Probably.
[25:02.07]Probably.
[25:11.43]I don't want to pick up too much shit, because... I only have two more spots, and I want to get rid of this is.
[25:17.34]You need to make enough room for your body.
[25:24.47]Damn it, I don't... Wait a minute, how do I... Wait, jetpack.
[25:30.37]Honey, look out, honey!
[25:35.05]Through the window.
[25:45.99]Should I get a lamp?
[25:53.12]Why do you play a silly married man so well?
[25:58.96]I don't know.
[25:59.45]I don't even know if that's a...
[26:11.66]Because he's not funny.
[26:13.94]Well, you didn't emphasize the he's not funny.
[26:16.32]I put that in, uh, like Etalyx.
[26:21.35]You didn't put that in Etalyx.
[26:23.19]I did.
[26:25.23]I think you were just saying that you just don't think I'm funny.
[26:28.61]That's fair.
[26:32.82]Enjoying the list of all of my school teachers.
[26:36.30]And probably some of my family and probably some strangers and friends.
[26:49.73]I'm too, I have to get down here.
[26:51.55]I wish there was a crouch.
[26:52.35]Alright, I'm getting a bigger shovel.
[27:05.87]I found it.
[27:08.05]Money bag?
[27:09.04]Somebody put $21 down.
[27:09.70]Why would you bury $21 this far down?
[27:10.96]Guys, bodies are buried more shallow than this.
[27:21.02]21 bucks all the way down here you got to put at least a full like kilo you got to put a whole kilogram of gold down there you don't put 20 bucks down there 21 bucks in 1798 was a lot
[27:52.57]This is a question I've never asked and a question I've never really had to answer.
[28:00.26]What was the U.S.
[28:02.58]tender?
[28:03.34]What was the U.S.
[28:04.02]dollar like before Ben Franklin?
[28:07.70]What did it have on it?
[28:10.39]They used the British pound.
[28:12.65]So is that a British pound?
[28:16.89]Or a piece of silver?
[28:18.67]Or a piece of gold?
[28:19.35]Because if that's money, like, with Ben Franklin on it, that shit's pretty recent.
[28:25.06]That's not from, like, the 1600s.
[28:37.64]They used the Euro.
[28:38.94]Yeah, back in, like, the 1700s.
[28:41.56]They used the Euro.
[28:50.65]Battery, oh shit the battery's really low.
[28:52.13]I didn't charge.
[28:58.24]We used doubloons and we were pirates.
[29:00.00]Imagine getting on the hundred though.
[29:14.31]And not even being a fucking president.
[29:26.02]And you're getting on the 100.
[29:27.36]Do you think like George Washington was pissed about that?
[29:39.47]Yes, we conked, we took, we repelled the British.
[29:42.79]I was the most celebrated general to ever exist.
[29:45.64]And I was the president that really started it all.
[29:49.36]One dollar.
[29:52.30]And then this asshole...
[29:54.82]It was like smoking weed all day and doing philosophies and getting struck by lightning.
[29:59.02]It's on the 100.
[29:59.69]He was number one.
[30:14.15]That's true.
[30:24.88]Alright, my inventory scroll is fine.
[30:26.78]I want to... What happened to that thing that I had?
[30:37.55]I probably told this story before.
[30:38.63]Have I ever told the story before?
[30:41.69]Of my uncle scamming me when I was a kid?
[30:43.21]Did I ever talk about this?
[30:47.19]I had to have, right?
[30:53.71]So my uncle, I had to have been probably, I don't know, I was like 10 or like nine.
[31:00.05]I was, yeah, I don't remember.
[31:01.83]It's been a long time guys.
[31:02.94]I've had every book, every single book in the dictionary, every word in it.
[31:06.40]I've, I've said it probably a thousand times.
[31:08.32]Like I've, you know what I mean?
[31:09.18]There's so much, so much just happened in my life.
[31:11.68]So I was a kid and I had a $5 bill.
[31:15.21]I don't know what I did.
[31:15.91]I had a must've like, oh, I did chores and I got a $5 bill.
[31:20.79]And my uncle took out a penny.
[31:23.76]And he said, Hey, um, I'll trade you my Lincoln for your Lincoln.
[31:28.91]And I was like, what do you mean?
[31:29.85]He's like, I'll trade you my Lincoln for your Lincoln.
[31:32.23]It's the same precedent.
[31:32.97]It's the same value.
[31:34.49]This one's just smaller and easier to carry around.
[31:36.47]It's like, really?
[31:38.92]Well, I mean, that makes sense.
[31:40.24]It is the same president.
[31:41.56]I thought it was the same value because it was the same president.
[31:44.96]So I did it and I was like, wow, this is so much more convenient.
[31:50.39]And then I think my mother stepped in and was like, hey, what are you doing?
[31:54.03]He gave it back.
[31:57.61]Fuck, I didn't sell anything.
[32:05.34]You were fucking stupid.
[32:06.56]I was like six.
[32:13.69]I was probably five or six years old.
[32:20.16]read at six I don't I don't know how old I it's a childhood memory I did it's not like this is a childhood memory from when I was exactly uh 11 years old and uh in two months and uh I had uh I remember captain crunch for breakfast that day guys when you get to be my age a whole swath of your life just kind of didn't happen and you just kind of hear about them like from ages one to like 12 I I remember like three things
[32:49.95]I want this to be bigger.
[32:52.82]That's the problem.
[32:53.50]It's too narrow.
[33:05.08]Just wait.
[33:05.57]You'll see.
[33:06.41]Just wait until you get to be in your mid to late 30s or into your early 40s.
[33:14.22]Like that concert you went to when you were like 15 is like, yeah, I kind of remember doing that, but I don't remember a goddamn thing about it.
[33:25.29]Wait.
[33:30.32]What the fuck?
[33:30.84]I just got 20 bucks.
[33:31.60]Nice.
[33:31.80]There we go.
[33:36.25]Alright.
[33:36.59]Now it's much easier for me to get actually in here.
[33:45.05]I don't care about stone anymore.
[33:46.69]I'm just trying to skip it or break it.
[34:02.55]That's alright.
[34:03.23]I just want to keep going down.
[34:04.59]Even if it breaks it, there'll be better stuff in a minute.
[34:07.95]Whatever that is.
[34:13.07]Figure shovel.
[34:17.65]Alright.
[34:18.23]I might just be making this whole thing up, but whatever.
[34:20.87]I don't even care.
[34:21.39]I just, you just like triggered me to say it.
[34:23.61]Somebody said, how can you remember every item from Diablo II, but not the concert you went to?
[34:28.88]Because I didn't go to the concert 10,000 times.
[34:32.98]I played Diablo II 10,000 times.
[34:45.31]Iron, coal, iron.
[34:46.37]Alright, no more stone.
[34:47.17]That's good.
[35:01.66]Is there a speed?
[35:02.34]Can I increase my speed?
[35:17.82]Uh-oh.
[35:19.24]I have enough to get out, right?
[35:20.04]Yeah.
[35:23.32]Okay, if I explode, do I die instantly?
[35:26.30]And is there a save?
[35:27.82]I don't know if there's a save button.
[35:42.43]Okay.
[35:42.61]Oh, is that a save?
[35:46.80]Thank God you told me.
[35:48.19]That would have been a disaster.
[35:57.35]How many slots do I have?
[36:00.07]12.
[36:00.09]Okay, good.
[36:01.59]I can see where the light is going to be necessary in a minute here.
[36:05.77]Please do an explosion joke.
[36:07.33]It would be very funny.
[36:08.35]I know that's what you all want.
[36:17.04]But I'm sorry, it's not going to happen right now.
[36:23.49]Copper.
[36:28.45]How big does the hole need to be for me to actually fit through it?
[36:36.35]Kind of big.
[36:44.09]Wait, what is that?
[36:46.32]Did I make it?
[36:46.84]It's like a cave system.
[36:49.35]Whoa, this is a cave.
[36:50.47]Is it going to hurt if I fall?
[36:57.39]What the fuck?
[36:58.15]Oh my God.
[36:58.63]Alright, hold on.
[37:00.30]Is it fall damage?
[37:04.48]Oh shit.
[37:04.82]What is that?
[37:10.89]It's a jewel.
[37:14.97]What is that?
[37:16.43]Silver.
[37:17.64]Oh my god, I can't see anything.
[37:18.62]I don't know where to go.
[37:20.74]Up.
[37:21.36]Down.
[37:22.48]Up.
[37:22.80]Down.
[37:23.32]What?
[37:24.08]Up.
[37:29.16]Oh, wait.
[37:29.59]It's telling me where I'm looking?
[37:30.81]I don't know what this is trying to say.
[37:34.77]Uh...
[37:51.66]I'm facing.
[37:53.54]Oh, there it is.
[37:55.88]Get me out.
[37:59.54]Is that not it?
[38:04.16]Where the hell is it?
[38:13.88]Uh-oh.
[38:16.88]How do I get out of here?
[38:25.53]It's right there.
[38:31.95]Get the fuck in there.
[38:33.25]What?
[38:36.45]Come on!
[38:37.83]Come on!
[38:43.16]No, no, no, no.
[38:43.74]I can jump.
[38:46.88]Just do not use the jetpack under any circumstances.
[38:52.76]Uh...
[39:03.69]Just don't tap space again when you're in the air.
[39:05.89]Uh-oh.
[39:12.11]Make stairs?
[39:12.81]If I click the button, I explode.
[39:30.47]Okay, well that's good to know that the thing goes all the way down without digging.
[39:34.16]I lost the silver.
[39:39.42]Is that bad?
[39:48.07]That's extremely bad.
[40:01.27]Well, shit.
[40:07.95]I need the light.
[40:08.45]Yeah, I need 25 bucks first.
[40:15.07]Oh, the game we're playing later is Fly Night.
[40:18.73]I think we're gonna... That hurts.
[40:21.87]Okay, there is fall damage.
[40:22.81]Alright, that is the... You can tell because it looks like a bug did it.
[40:28.35]It looks like an ant hill or a mound or that's how you can tell that I did it.
[40:33.37]Iron, that's fine.
[40:48.04]So you can go this way.
[40:48.88]This is like a weird little.
[40:49.76]Alright, I need more.
[40:52.82]I'm just going to pick up all the random shit on the ground, whatever.
[41:04.91]I was going over here.
[41:05.69]I can have two holes, right?
[41:10.46]What is that?
[41:14.88]Is this the side of the house or is this something cool?
[41:19.24]I think that's the side.
[41:20.17]That's the house.
[41:26.29]Wait, is it?
[41:30.55]Is this like an underground freezer?
[41:33.13]That looks like an underground freezer.
[41:44.64]That is not the house.
[41:46.34]So what is that?
[42:03.10]Okay, I have a lamp now.
[42:04.16]Alright, it's F to put the lamp down.
[42:11.57]Do you think a nuclear weapon would kill you?
[42:15.47]Um... What... What... What... Just answer that question yourself.
[42:22.61]You've been to the third grade.
[42:30.58]Yeah, what the hell even... This is definitely not... This is something weird.
[42:45.05]I'm gonna cover in this whole thing, whatever it is.
[42:54.04]You talked about the nuclear war in the third grade?
[43:02.36]Do you?
[43:03.04]You learn about it pretty early.
[43:04.37]Yeah, what is this?
[43:12.91]Okay, I'm very curious.
[43:30.52]I like the sound, though.
[43:31.40]It's a great sound.
[43:39.82]Looks like a magic eye.
[43:43.22]Can you guys do magic eyes?
[43:44.10]Do you guys know how to do them?
[43:45.50]I can do them every time, guaranteed.
[43:55.02]Yeah, I actually don't like to do them, though, because they hurt my head.
[43:58.87]Holy shit, I just barely got out.
[44:12.14]I still have a lamp.
[44:16.16]Make stairs.
[44:22.79]I feel like I kind of committed to, I'll make stairs in here.
[44:25.33]Alright, let's put this out.
[44:27.47]Where should I put it?
[44:29.97]Down here.
[44:31.75]Does it stick to the wall?
[44:32.53]Ooh, it does.
[44:35.24]Okay.
[44:44.38]Ooh, silver.
[44:45.28]Alright, I'm good.
[44:45.78]Alright, I'm going to make a much better way to get in.
[44:50.66]Never mind, there's another way to go.
[44:51.68]Let me clear this first.
[44:56.82]I'll get distracted here.
[45:15.77]I don't want to do it for too long.
[45:16.69]Halfway, I got to go back.
[45:19.61]Should you get the flank steak or the nachos?
[45:25.67]Nachos are an appetizer and flank steak sounds like an entree.
[45:28.31]I don't know.
[45:32.35]What course of the meal is it?
[45:37.39]Can you make a Minecraft spider noise to scare the kids?
[45:41.35]Yeah, sure.
[45:47.82]What the fuck?
[45:50.12]Dude, I hear someone.
[45:51.75]Oh, wait a minute.
[45:54.61]I also hear... I hear a husky talking.
[45:57.29]No!
[46:25.80]Ooh, that was clean.
[46:27.74]Hey, it's my birthday.
[46:32.22]Can you please do Mr. Satan?
[46:36.80]That was Mr. Satan going through a tunnel.
[46:42.59]That's all you're going to get.
[46:43.71]Happy birthday, though.
[46:44.45]I need way more light.
[47:08.32]What time is it?
[47:10.74]Okay, I'm just making sure I'm not missing the four horsemen time.
[47:18.94]What does this mean?
[47:20.36]They didn't explain what this does.
[47:22.50]What is this?
[47:24.02]Oh my god, I have a tea here.
[47:24.99]I completely forgot about it.
[47:26.73]That's like, wow.
[47:28.73]Is it still hot?
[47:31.79]Probably not.
[47:36.05]No, that's okay.
[47:36.63]That's a good temp.
[47:39.88]It means go down, go down, go down, go down.
[47:53.33]It's been there for two days.
[47:54.79]Alright, I got a light.
[48:04.49]Whoa.
[48:06.45]This game is fucked.
[48:13.91]What is that?
[48:14.69]Ooh, there's more shit down here.
[48:19.95]Silver.
[48:20.87]Silver.
[48:22.15]Iron.
[48:23.92]Whatever that is.
[48:25.40]Iron.
[48:27.34]Uh, copper.
[48:28.94]Copper.
[48:30.88]Paper.
[48:32.34]Metal.
[48:34.00]What's this made out of?
[48:35.62]Metal.
[48:36.62]Wario.
[48:37.96]No.
[48:38.74]What's this made out of?
[48:40.35]Wario.
[48:41.19]No.
[48:41.43]No.
[48:43.84]a book no uh I need one more I love someone just wrote love that bird
[49:14.45]Silver is worth a lot.
[49:15.69]Oh, 150 bucks.
[49:16.77]And now we are absolutely cooking.
[49:18.51]I'm ready.
[49:22.30]Bigger shovel.
[49:23.00]I want more, more lamps.
[49:25.02]Alright.
[49:26.24]The shovel is huge now.
[49:40.18]I was going to just make a disgusting comment.
[49:43.53]Pretend I did.
[49:55.48]Gonna keep going down.
[49:59.22]Doesn't feel like upgraded at all.
[50:12.85]Definitely doing battery next.
[50:20.78]That's a huge piece of iron.
[50:21.92]Can I do anything about it?
[50:22.86]Wait, dynamite.
[50:25.00]That's what that's for.
[50:27.54]You can blow them up with dynamite.
[50:28.72]Okay.
[50:30.72]So the huge ones you blow up with dynamite.
[50:36.01]I gotta get dynamite.
[50:36.59]What is it, 100 bucks for dynamite?
[50:43.71]My mom heard you say that, dog.
[50:47.18]Let me help you out here.
[50:50.13]Yeah, and carry the 1.
[50:52.29]And that's how you do long division.
[50:54.81]Yep, the 2 goes up there.
[50:57.09]The 3 goes that way.
[50:58.85]And then you're solving for x there.
[51:09.43]Now, not studying in here, by the way.
[51:19.59]He's watching junk food.
[51:20.91]He's watching junk food.
[51:21.97]He's watching junk food.
[51:23.03]Uh, I'm gonna explode.
[51:25.23]I don't think I can get out.
[51:34.01]Maybe in one go I can do it.
[51:35.11]It's gotta be perfect.
[51:53.56]Alright, keep going.
[51:55.90]I know I need to look at, I need to make stairs or something.
[51:57.78]This is going to take so much longer.
[51:58.84]Okay, let's, this has to be cleaned up a lot.
[52:05.04]I agree.
[52:09.54]It's going to take me a little bit longer, but whatever.
[52:11.08]This hole needs to be way, way better to go into.
[52:20.40]What's the most amount of Cheez-Its you've ever had?
[52:23.62]Those that count their Cheez-Its.
[52:26.74]Shouldn't be eating them in the first place.
[52:29.86]Cheez-Its are a when I'm done snack.
[52:40.05]Sometimes that's three.
[52:42.99]I'm not kidding.
[52:43.59]Sometimes that's three individual Cheez-Its and that's it.
[52:47.97]Put it away.
[52:54.41]There is no, like, there's no minimum or maximum of what a Cheez-It, like, how many you should eat.
[53:00.10]Well, that's, that's absolutely not true.
[53:02.46]There's a maximum.
[53:03.90]There's no minimum.
[53:05.69]Don't eat a bunch of Cheez-Its, is what I'm saying.
[53:10.03]Go eat a fucking banana.
[53:30.73]No, no, no.
[53:31.21]I just saw something.
[53:31.83]No, you're not doing a Cheez-It crusted banana.
[53:38.60]Don't do that.
[53:40.64]Is this video less than 30 seconds long that you're describing?
[53:49.92]The only time that, like, chip or, like, talkie or cheese it, dipped or crusted anything, that is only on a video that is less than 30 to 40 seconds long.
[54:04.47]I've never seen it in real life either.
[54:15.88]Alright, that's... I want like a little... Make myself like a little Elden Ring jump.
[54:22.34]Like that, okay.
[54:23.44]Then I'll clear this.
[54:30.50]Are you... Do you like the Wendy's Baconator?
[54:32.51]I haven't had... I haven't... I don't know.
[54:39.07]Let's play streamer Mad Libs.
[54:40.73]Just like whatever you wanted me to say, just fill it in.
[54:44.03]So here, I'll give you an example.
[54:47.20]Oh, the Wendy's Baconator.
[54:48.24]Yeah, I've heard about that.
[54:50.08]I tried it, and it was... You can just think whatever you want it to be.
[54:56.08]That's fine.
[54:58.43]Uh, okay.
[55:06.79]He hates streaming.
[55:16.57]Choose your own adventure, yeah.
[55:23.83]Yeah.
[55:24.49]Dude, like, oh, look at these streamers.
[55:26.62]Like, never before.
[55:27.58]What a wild new technology.
[55:30.34]You could ask a person a question, and they're there, and they're live, and maybe they could even say... I don't know.
[55:35.22]You just say whatever you wanted me to say in your mind.
[55:37.72]Yeah, I really did kind of stop streaming, didn't I?
[55:41.21]Yeah.
[55:47.18]Alright, I'm happier with this.
[55:51.06]See, now we can go like bup, and then I want to go bup.
[55:54.70]So let's get rid of that.
[55:58.64]I'm making platforms.
[56:03.75]Oh, right here.
[56:04.73]Good.
[56:19.47]Why play this game when you can do it in real life?
[56:21.29]That's the best part.
[56:24.24]Because I'm not doing it in real life, I'm not going to get dirty.
[56:28.62]Okay, there we go.
[56:29.60]That's much better.
[56:32.76]At least on the way down.
[56:33.46]Are we going to replay Elden Ring?
[56:46.95]Um... No, probably not.
[56:52.93]Oh, my God.
[56:53.31]I was just puked.
[57:02.48]I need to... Yeah, alright.
[57:03.82]Now I'm going to go down for real.
[57:08.94]I'll play the new standalone game whenever it comes out.
[57:17.52]Got tons of light, full battery.
[57:19.30]How much is it?
[57:19.68]100 bucks?
[57:21.02]Okay.
[57:22.96]I need $100 and don't spend it.
[57:27.97]We need a me strong playthrough.
[57:31.59]That's right.
[57:32.09]I forgot about the me strong playthrough.
[57:34.37]That never would have got... I'm so glad I didn't do that.
[57:39.94]That would have been so unbearable.
[57:41.64]It would not have been fun.
[57:44.32]It would have sucked.
[57:55.59]Alright.
[57:56.41]I can go down even further.
[57:57.91]It's the furthest I've ever been.
[58:01.57]Don't get lost, but I'm going to say let's dig.
[58:06.89]Silver right there.
[58:08.95]Yep.
[58:11.58]Thank you.
[58:14.52]No, dude, it would have been fun.
[58:17.70]You say that, but
[58:20.24]there is only a certain amount of time that I can walk around in a circle in Limgrave and die to the alright you know that enemy is like the first guardsman you find it's him in one dog it's like the first actual encounter that's not the Tree Sentinel I probably would die to that guy like three times
[58:57.97]The guy with the spear?
[59:01.37]No, no, no, not the big camp.
[59:03.23]There's one guy that just has a torch, I think, and he's just on the road.
[59:07.19]I feel like I'm running out of battery too quickly.
[59:27.82]Another one of these.
[59:28.60]Shit.
[59:32.90]I have silver.
[59:34.74]On the way up, I'm going to grab some more stuff.
[59:40.12]Silver.
[59:40.52]Good.
[59:41.06]No.
[59:42.72]No.
[59:43.30]No.
[59:43.46]Uh-oh.
[59:45.78]Shit.
[59:46.18]This is bad.
[59:46.66]I don't know.
[59:49.10]Am I hanging upside down?
[59:51.96]Oh, I'm dead.
[59:53.24]I'm dead.
[59:53.84]Yeah.
[59:54.90]Yep.
[59:55.68]No way.
[59:57.47]I don't know where I am.
[59:58.53]And, uh, I don't.
[60:07.41]My platforms, my platforms, my platforms.
[60:09.47]Hold on.
[60:12.27]This is why I did this.
[60:23.95]I did it.
[60:29.13]There we go 116.
[60:30.41]Now I have a huge battery good.
[60:42.77]You know what?
[60:46.31]Let's make some money.
[60:48.09]I'm not going all the way down there unless I'm doing one or two more upgrades at least.
[61:05.14]When I get to 250 bucks, that's when I'll go down again.
[61:20.82]Don't pick up the stone.
[61:21.96]Pick up the iron.
[61:22.95]Okay, there we go.
[61:27.15]Save the game.
[61:27.67]Oh, that's right.
[61:34.59]Good.
[61:36.27]50.
[61:36.29]Ow.
[61:40.28]Ow.
[61:41.86]Alright.
[61:44.86]Straight up from here.
[61:45.82]Let's get some stuff.
[61:59.75]Iron is good.
[62:00.77]Copper is not.
[62:06.94]Give me some more silver.
[62:15.99]Copper?
[62:16.33]You're gonna get stuck in here again?
[62:18.21]Not if I get out right now.
[62:47.59]I made it.
[62:48.95]Have you seen Sonic 3?
[62:49.99]I haven't seen Sonic 2.
[62:53.19]So, um, no, I have not.
[62:58.09]What do I want here?
[62:59.65]Dynamite.
[63:00.37]Alright.
[63:01.60]I have one dynamite.
[63:06.90]So I'm going to throw it at that copper, right?
[63:16.72]Okay.
[63:19.67]How do I use it?
[63:28.08]That was $100.
[63:28.30]Gone.
[63:51.71]Is there a better dynamite or is that just to clear the way?
[63:54.74]Should I get another one?
[64:23.05]Okay, let's... Should I throw it at the other one?
[64:25.96]Please fly up onto the roof.
[64:30.68]You cannot.
[64:33.17]You just made me spend a dollar.
[64:37.19]Stop buying lamps?
[64:38.33]What if I need them?
[64:40.39]You never know when you're gonna need them.
[64:50.64]Okay, here we go.
[64:52.12]Now I'm going to go down.
[64:53.12]Blow this up.
[65:07.35]Cool.
[65:07.95]I'm going to go down this hole.
[65:24.92]That new?
[65:25.26]Alright, don't be so haphazard about this.
[65:32.07]Actually clear it out.
[65:32.75]Are you ever going to play Tears of the Kingdom?
[65:37.25]I just found gold.
[65:39.30]Alright, do not die down here.
[65:42.88]It's very important.
[65:46.92]No, I'm probably not going to play Tears of the Kingdom.
[65:50.93]I probably won't play Tears of the Kingdom off stream either.
[65:56.79]You just avoided the question.
[65:57.77]I just answered it.
[65:58.53]I just gave a clear yes or no answer to that question.
[66:03.43]That's the clearest I think I've ever been in my life on stream.
[66:16.24]You suck at Zelda.
[66:23.85]Alright, and when you, in like 20 years, when you teach Nintendo history for Yale University, you can go over that.
[66:52.34]That'd be a sick class.
[66:53.36]Okay, do you guys think that eventually we're going to have media classes like that?
[66:56.50]Because media... Now I'm going to pause here because this is important.
[67:02.32]Media is actually fairly new.
[67:05.75]Multimedia is about 100 years old.
[67:11.01]People were fighting in medieval times and all kinds of crazy shit happened over thousands of years.
[67:16.59]They weren't playing video games or watching movies two, three, four, five hundred years ago.
[67:22.51]There's going to be a whole new thing to have to have history on.
[67:28.16]Like what happens 500 years from now when we are the medieval times in what we see as the medieval times now?
[67:36.38]Will they be old?
[67:37.86]Will some of you have, you know, your great-grandchildren have glasses on and like squiggly white hair and lean down old?
[67:45.11]Like, well, you see, my great-great-grandfather, he was, what he did is he played these video games and this is his old dusty, and this is going to be like history.
[67:54.23]Hold on to history here.
[67:58.27]Yeah, we barely had pictures for a hundred years.
[68:07.96]Yeah, start holding on to your N64s.
[68:09.68]You want to know something else crazy?
[68:12.96]Think of this.
[68:15.14]I think we already talked about this, did we?
[68:16.60]Maybe not.
[68:18.62]So when I, and this is going to sound crazy to a lot of you.
[68:22.86]When I was a kid, when I was a kid, we're talking this is more than 20 years ago now.
[68:27.88]20 plus years ago.
[68:31.24]Hold on.
[68:31.70]If I could get out of this fucking hole, I could tell you a story.
[68:37.90]So like 20 to 30 years ago, you're talking about the late eighties, early nineties.
[68:46.79]Super Nintendo, NES, even Atari was still kind of around.
[68:53.22]That now, like right now, is kind of starting to get replaced for a lot of younger people.
[69:00.02]If you're, you know, when you, if you're 25, you know, let's say you're 20 right now, your Super Nintendo was what, like the 360?
[69:07.43]The, like the Wii?
[69:13.95]Your battery's gonna die.
[69:16.93]It was the Wii for PS2, PS3, PS3, Xbox 360, even like some of the newer Xboxes, some of the newer PlayStations.
[69:24.99]So to me, that is crazy to me that the PlayStation 3 is some of you guys' Super Nintendo.
[69:36.35]So what I'm telling you to do, hold on to your PS3 because 20 years from now, when you are my age, when you're 35, 40,
[69:48.08]you are going to wish you held on to your PS3.
[69:50.60]And there's going to be an aftermarket for it.
[69:52.42]And think about the aftermarket now for the even older shit, like the Super Nintendo, an original one.
[69:59.83]Hold on to your PS3.
[70:00.89]Hold on to your Wii.
[70:01.59]Seriously, do it.
[70:02.41]Because you're going to wish you did.
[70:06.15]Will you stop talking and dig the damn hole?
[70:16.14]I'm trying to- I'm trying to PREPARE you motherfuckers, alright?
[70:33.87]I still have my 3DS?
[70:34.45]Yeah!
[70:38.98]So right, but here's, let's go even further.
[70:42.64]Right now, the PS5 is going to be somebody's Super Nintendo in 20 years.
[70:53.25]And dude, ain't, nobody made it like the Super Nintendo, by the way.
[70:57.37]I'm sorry.
[70:57.81]It's way better than the PS3.
[70:59.76]I'm going to have to be a little elitist here.
[71:02.24]My Super Nintendo was better than your Super Nintendo and everybody else's.
[71:06.26]And I'm so sorry, but it's true.
[71:15.13]No, you cannot say that's wrong.
[71:16.81]You cannot wrong that.
[71:18.29]Everybody here knows that.
[71:25.85]My dad could beat up your dad.
[71:27.57]That's fine.
[71:29.37]That doesn't... That does not... That has nothing to do with the Super Nintendo.
[71:37.52]How can the PS5 be somebody's Super Nintendo if it doesn't have any games?
[71:43.04]Dude, we got to make sure that this is what, like, listen to me.
[71:46.22]We got to make some good shit.
[71:47.93]We got to make some good quality shit for these young people.
[71:50.17]Did you hear what you just said?
[71:53.99]We need more good, high quality shit for these young people.
[71:58.63]The PS5 is somebody's Super Nintendo.
[72:00.72]This is like developmental bull, you know, we got to get this shit under control.
[72:15.59]astrobot yeah okay that's fair and I hold on here's the thing Minecraft Minecraft is that I think I think instead of individual consoles which is what it was for a lot of us back in the day it's going to turn out to be individual games individual experiences and I think Minecraft is probably one of them I think Minecraft is going to be your super Nintendo not the PlayStation 4 or a PS5 or whatever PS3
[72:47.68]That's a pretty cool Super Nintendo to have, honestly.
[72:52.86]Yeah, I'm sitting here thinking about that.
[72:54.50]If Minecraft was my Super Nintendo... That's some pretty high quality shit.
[73:00.82]Yeah, that's good.
[73:01.46]Alright, I'm gonna blow this up.
[73:12.75]Don't get hit by it.
[73:27.26]Wouldn't like the gas and the vapors come up and like burn my fucking face off?
[73:47.77]I don't need light.
[73:48.81]Keep an eye on my battery.
[73:52.97]What is this trying to tell me now?
[73:53.83]Go up?
[73:54.55]Wait.
[73:55.95]Oh, there's something here.
[74:10.64]What did Ster say that one time?
[74:11.98]That don't listen to a single thing anybody in your community says because Five Nights at Freddy's is their, like, most important media.
[74:20.69]Like, is that your Super Nintendo?
[74:32.68]I don't know how many younger people are here.
[74:35.14]I mean, this community is all over the place nowadays.
[74:39.04]I have no idea what the real demographics of this place really are.
[74:43.20]I know we have a lot of scientists and doctors and shit.
[74:56.19]Okay, don't... I gotta get up.
[75:08.14]it's crazy how really it takes about a third of your whole bar to do that I think a lot of people a lot of this community seems to be in their early 20s late teens early 20s some in their mid-20s late 20s
[75:32.83]Okay, I'm doing this next.
[75:35.31]No more dynamite.
[75:41.15]Seeing a few 29, seeing some 30s, 31, 31.
[75:43.31]Yeah, that makes sense to me.
[75:48.58]So you know what I'm talking about then.
[75:49.62]A lot of you in your 30s, you know what I'm talking about.
[76:01.50]We've got to help guide these young people.
[76:06.63]And teach them that Chrono Trigger is a way better Super Nintendo than Five Nights at Freddy's.
[76:12.99]We have to tell them this stuff.
[76:24.58]They must know.
[76:32.20]Alright, full bar.
[76:33.80]I'm getting whatever this is.
[76:35.68]Am I late for the four horsemen meeting?
[76:41.11]No, we're good.
[76:43.99]It was over here.
[76:44.65]Where is it?
[76:48.69]Right here.
[76:50.81]Oh.
[76:52.29]Oh.
[76:53.49]It's glitching through the wall, whatever it is.
[77:03.51]Where is it?
[77:03.89]What the hell is going on here?
[77:15.80]Oh, also, don't be surprised if one day randomly... I'm probably going to get... How many followers do I have?
[77:22.49]I have 1.4, 1.5 million followers.
[77:25.67]I'm probably going under a million after I say this.
[77:29.26]Whatever, I don't give a fuck.
[77:31.70]So, don't be surprised if you see... I might just turn on a World of Warcraft hardcore weirdo stream.
[77:39.34]Where I just play and just don't even talk.
[77:40.94]And just grind.
[77:46.98]Don't be surprised if you see me grinding.
[77:53.08]I'm just going to put on loud ass music.
[77:55.92]Why?
[77:56.12]I can't get over here.
[78:05.85]What am I getting stuck on?
[78:06.95]My head?
[78:07.37]Oh.
[78:12.86]Where is it?
[78:13.40]I am so confused.
[78:15.88]Is it in this thing?
[78:16.84]That's going to be a career ending stream.
[78:36.28]This way, I'm not picking it up.
[78:38.70]The three rings is what you need to see, right?
[78:50.43]I'm actually hyped about that.
[78:51.77]I don't know.
[78:57.29]It looks fun.
[78:58.01]I've been following all the hardcore stuff.
[78:59.84]And it's just like, I feel like I'm on the outside looking at it like a fun party.
[79:11.53]Is it the rock?
[79:25.76]Did you watch Etalyx lose his- Wait, Etalyx died?
[79:28.40]Oh no.
[79:31.28]When?
[79:31.88]When did- No.
[79:32.72]Oh shit.
[79:39.87]Oh, that's not good.
[79:42.60]Are you just making that up?
[79:52.34]I don't know where this thing is, but apparently it's like right here somewhere.
[79:59.84]But I need to leave.
[80:09.83]Come on, dude.
[80:10.75]What the...
[80:19.79]It's the speed of the beeps.
[80:30.52]I need it.
[80:30.88]Yeah, that's the thing about losing a character in hardcore is like...
[80:48.13]It's so sad.
[80:49.11]And that's what I'm not prepared for.
[80:51.81]So what I'm going... If I do this, what I'd be going into it, I just... We're going to make a statement at the very beginning that I don't care if I die.
[81:00.52]It doesn't matter.
[81:01.86]I'm just going to play.
[81:03.12]If I die, who cares?
[81:04.16]I'm just uninstalling the game.
[81:05.14]I don't know.
[81:11.40]I haven't made a commitment to do it yet.
[81:35.49]I'm gonna find whatever this is oh what's that that looks weird whatever this is what is this
[82:12.26]Is this the foundation of your house?
[82:16.82]I don't think so.
[82:17.80]I mean, this thing is beeping.
[82:19.14]This thing is saying, hey, it's right here.
[82:37.93]And get up.
[82:45.26]I'm getting stuck on every little thing.
[82:46.70]I have to leave.
[82:49.24]But I got to remember this is here.
[82:52.33]I'm just going to charge and come right back.
[82:57.13]It's so disorienting down here, though.
[82:59.37]Okay, it's... Where am I?
[83:03.34]Oh, everything is... Everything is beige and maroon.
[83:07.68]I can't... Where am I?
[83:08.70]Oh, fuck.
[83:14.21]Okay.
[83:18.31]You're watching three of the four horsemen at the same time.
[83:20.87]Don't do that.
[83:25.81]You watch the fourth one at the same time?
[83:28.69]You know what the four horsemen do, right?
[83:31.27]Careful.
[83:39.39]I'll take the space.
[83:40.03]Alright.
[83:52.52]More investigation is needed for this thing.
[83:55.98]What is this?
[83:56.78]When are you going to play SimCity?
[84:05.30]Um...
[84:09.93]I don't know.
[84:10.47]I'm not going to ever say never.
[84:12.73]I have to finish Nancy's roof.
[84:21.49]Be finishing anything seems very difficult nowadays.
[84:28.25]Is it just this thing?
[84:29.33]Because it very clearly was lit up like crazy.
[84:32.66]What if I throw a dynamite at this?
[84:47.28]Yeah, this is a whole chunk of something.
[84:51.22]What's the last game that you fully finished?
[84:52.84]Well, on stream, probably, I don't know, Resident Evil 4?
[84:59.57]What was the last game that I finished on stream?
[85:21.90]I need a better shovel too.
[85:26.52]Hello Kitty Adventure Island.
[85:27.86]I actually bought it because I figured, oh, that's a, that's a, that's, I'll play that.
[85:33.20]It's a funny thing.
[85:47.66]I gotta go up again.
[85:48.63]I'm not even close to uncovering what the hell this is.
[86:07.82]Alright, there's more here.
[86:08.88]I have to get out of here.
[86:18.42]What do I got?
[86:20.02]I can make money.
[86:26.43]Okay, 170.
[86:27.47]I need 300 for the shovel.
[86:34.35]Should I just make some money?
[86:35.75]Alright, I'm going to just sell stuff.
[86:39.13]We're not going deep.
[86:39.77]Let's widen this up.
[87:10.21]Four horsemen.
[87:10.81]Which one are you?
[87:11.45]Somebody said I must be pestilence.
[87:16.85]We tried to figure this out.
[87:18.81]I think we can swap.
[87:20.80]You know, depending on the day.
[87:42.07]The big market for backyard coal, apparently.
[87:44.45]That's true.
[87:46.87]Alright, let me get up and stretch.
[87:50.33]Trying to do this thing, at least when I play alone on solo streams, to get up every, like, hour or so, really, and try to stick to it.
[87:59.93]Playing with other people, though, you know, you can't be like, hold on a minute, I'll be back in five minutes every hour.
[88:04.13]So, I'll be right back.
[88:07.65]I'm going to play some ads, too.
[88:09.21]I think pre-rolls are currently on, so let's turn them off.
[88:13.62]I'll be right back.
[88:17.20]Give me like three or four minutes.
[88:20.06]I'm going to feed auto too.
[88:22.67]And make it five.
[88:23.23]Let's make it a solid five.
[88:25.21]Be right back.
[88:49.20]you
[89:57.99]Thank you.
[91:30.22]Thank you.
[93:30.18]Hello, hello.
[93:32.42]Just feeding Otto.
[93:34.22]He's hungry.
[93:34.80]Another minute or two.
[94:01.96]Thank you.
[96:20.58]Okay, I am back.
[96:23.80]Alright, let's keep going.
[96:25.80]What's this poll?
[96:27.60]Find yourself in a dungeon and what do you do?
[96:29.04]It's Dennis.
[96:31.61]Dennis is the winner.
[96:33.35]Congratulations, Dennis.
[96:35.67]I don't know what you won, but you won a something.
[96:38.39]Alright, let's do it.
[96:46.09]Back to what we were doing.
[96:49.03]Okay, so I need another 100 bucks.
[96:53.64]Definitely need to keep an eye on the clock because in about an hour of 40 minutes or so, the four horsemen are going to be looking for me.
[97:07.12]Alright, so what the hell is this thing?
[97:21.16]Can you please teach me something?
[97:22.46]I have to sit here and think about it.
[97:41.01]The headroom is the problem here.
[97:42.87]I'm getting that new shovel.
[97:55.40]Alright, that's a good amount of silver.
[97:56.66]Yeah, at about three... How about this?
[97:59.60]At like 345.
[98:01.52]So in about 45 minutes from right now.
[98:06.59]Just give me an alert.
[98:09.73]Because I will leave the game and start to get ready for the co-op part of the stream.
[98:17.85]Playing Fly Knight again.
[98:21.41]You need me to just go look it up.
[98:31.11]This is like filled in.
[98:32.19]Oh shit.
[98:38.91]Okay.
[98:41.71]Okay, let's go.
[98:51.16]The opportunity to teach me something was right there, but fine.
[98:56.50]How did I look over and see your message again?
[98:58.46]I have not looked at chat since you said that.
[99:03.62]And you were two in a row, the two comments that I picked out.
[99:07.71]I said, what's in here?
[99:31.98]Okay, well, I guess I gotta go that way.
[99:44.85]Think you'll be studied when you die.
[99:46.57]No.
[99:47.83]Oh, I'm just a regular fucking dude.
[99:58.79]They'll probably study the period.
[100:00.73]I might end up in a fucking documentary about streaming, you know, 20 years from now.
[100:06.83]They might do a clip of me doing that lion shit that, you know, like the lion roar pose.
[100:12.88]I really hope that's not the clip that they use, but that's probably what they're going to use.
[100:17.68]Or it's going to be the sus guy face, which that sucks.
[100:20.42]That's super irritating to me that that's like what's going to be left behind in the legacy.
[100:24.37]Better not be.
[100:30.52]I didn't even do that either.
[100:33.70]Here's the worst part about the sus guy face.
[100:36.16]That's my whole legacy to a lot of you, and I didn't even make it.
[100:39.17]I had nothing to do with it.
[100:42.89]It's just an image of my face that's been doctored.
[100:46.15]I didn't make it.
[100:46.75]Ooh, you can get a drill.
[100:56.81]The original image is worse.
[100:59.97]It is.
[101:01.33]I know it is.
[101:01.99]That's fine.
[101:06.66]But the original image, at least that was me that did that.
[101:12.86]I'm going to be remembered for something I didn't even do.
[101:19.46]I got to do more shit.
[101:30.68]Nah, I'm just kidding.
[101:33.54]Ooh.
[101:33.84]Alright, that's kind of scary.
[101:42.33]Just a single chest at the end of the hall?
[101:45.07]That is actually kind of... Guys.
[101:48.33]Guys.
[101:50.15]Guys.
[101:51.81]Guys.
[102:03.96]You'd be the Thomas Edison of Twitch.
[102:06.06]No, I would not.
[102:08.16]But I would love to pose with a giant pocket watch and a weird suit on and have the photo be in black and white.
[102:13.72]And that's what we use officially for everything.
[102:29.81]Alright.
[102:30.05]So hold on.
[102:30.51]What is this?
[102:34.48]um what I'm gonna jump out of this two dynamite four lamps and 78 money oh cool alright
[103:00.22]Would you even as a concept hold up 50 years from now?
[103:04.54]I'm surprised that this channel has lasted as long as it has already.
[103:09.26]I gotta get out of here.
[103:39.05]Alright.
[103:40.36]I want more.
[103:43.52]Should I save for the drill or go more battery?
[103:48.71]What time are you going to be with the horses?
[103:50.55]Uh, 4 PM Pacific.
[103:51.39]So just about one hour from now, 45 minutes from now.
[103:55.60]Wait for the drill.
[103:56.16]Okay.
[104:07.83]Guess I'm just gonna keep going down.
[104:10.82]Isn't there a certain level where you'd start to get a headache?
[104:14.84]Wouldn't the air pressure, like, start... mixing your thoughts together?
[104:19.52]Making you feel weird?
[104:28.75]That's the ocean.
[104:30.49]That same concept doesn't exist the more that you get to the center of the... By the way, what is... We don't even know what's in the center of the Earth.
[104:41.62]We've got some pretty good guesses.
[104:55.97]Oh my God, that goes even further.
[104:57.51]Alright, don't... I gotta be careful because I will get stuck down here.
[105:01.41]I got a lot of stuff.
[105:03.45]That's high altitude.
[105:12.52]Yeah, your fucking altitude is pretty bad right now.
[105:15.14]I agree.
[105:17.74]Don't come in here telling me that I got a bad altitude when you're the one that has... You're trying to correct my statements on science.
[105:31.24]Oh God, I'm going to be trapped in here.
[105:41.18]that wasn't that bad oh please that's a joke from that's a joke from like the 50s guys okay you don't what you don't think that uh that's a lot of money what's his name there he's a famous comedian from like the 50s I thought it was funny
[106:10.18]Hey, as long as one person buys a ticket, that's all that matters.
[106:22.87]You all showed up to the comedy show.
[106:25.65]You all bought tickets and the show sucks.
[106:32.23]I already got your fucking money.
[106:40.73]Uh, hold on.
[106:45.06]Damn, that's a lot.
[106:52.54]Okay.
[106:54.21]Alright, it's drill time.
[106:55.31]So how does this work?
[107:05.07]Do you think your burial will be streamed?
[107:09.65]Okay, this thing is way a thousand times better.
[107:16.26]We're doing the whole yard.
[107:16.96]I don't care about anything else.
[107:18.36]I'm going to mow the lawn.
[107:26.90]I've had lots of ideas over the years to do shit like that.
[107:32.68]But it's just not a joke.
[107:33.88]Don't make any jokes.
[107:37.52]And have it be what it would essentially...
[107:40.81]Haven't we talked about the flatline stream before?
[107:43.30]Like, yeah, this gets, like, kind of messed up.
[107:55.06]I wanted my retirement announcement stream to be just me lying, like, with a ton of old makeup on, lying in bed.
[108:02.43]And just have one of those, like,
[108:20.08]I wonder if you get an achievement for this.
[108:43.98]That looks awful.
[108:54.33]Lines are not parallel.
[108:55.77]Ruined.
[108:56.07]It's fine.
[109:16.23]Okay, the challenge was to do all that without exploding.
[109:20.89]And I did it.
[109:33.25]Alright, let's see.
[109:33.85]This is like a vacuum cleaner.
[109:34.99]This thing's great.
[109:40.73]Oh, my inventory shit.
[109:42.27]Sorry.
[109:46.43]I can really clear a lot of this out of the way now.
[109:50.15]In fact, I have a new plan.
[109:55.52]That plan is to get a straight shot down.
[109:58.56]No more of this bumpy bullshit.
[110:18.54]So much better.
[110:19.12]It's kind of what it feels like to use Photoshop when you don't know what you're doing.
[110:27.64]It's fun to make this stuff smudge around.
[110:29.34]Yeah, I want a straight shot down.
[110:43.87]No jagged edges, no bumps.
[110:49.71]At least to be able to get through here quickly.
[110:51.95]I kind of am just washing it, aren't I?
[111:22.07]Already looks way better.
[111:27.44]Don't destroy the ore.
[111:28.44]I'm destroying pieces of stone and that's fine.
[111:32.41]As long as it's not gold or silver.
[111:39.29]Why do you sound like Alvin in the chip?
[111:41.42]Why are you?
[111:42.44]I don't sound anything like what you're describing.
[111:50.11]What are you talking about?
[111:51.35]Is the question.
[112:00.66]It's opening bigger.
[112:03.04]There we go.
[112:03.86]Much better.
[112:29.06]Better.
[112:29.32]Okay.
[112:40.12]That's cleaner.
[112:40.74]Is the hamster stream going to finally happen?
[112:51.28]No.
[112:52.31]I don't think so.
[113:04.16]Alright.
[113:05.06]No confusion here.
[113:06.26]I just want to go straight down.
[113:24.32]I can probably turn the volume up a little bit, but I bet you that's probably going to be pretty annoying.
[113:28.96]So I'm going to leave it.
[113:45.13]Good.
[113:45.41]Let's get rid of this piece here.
[113:55.22]Good.
[114:10.11]Was the goal.
[114:10.73]I actually don't know what, if there is a goal to the game.
[114:19.45]Alright, battery pack is next.
[114:21.49]300.
[114:21.53]Yeah, I think it's just to dig a hole.
[114:31.65]I am going to get killed if I'm not careful though.
[114:37.23]Let's make that smoother.
[114:52.70]So satisfying.
[115:00.73]This is wicked satisfying.
[115:07.18]This is so satisfying.
[115:23.01]Watch that battery.
[115:23.97]Okay.
[115:28.89]That one piece is going to drive me crazy, but whatever.
[115:30.69]It's fine.
[115:33.31]Time check.
[115:34.29]Still good.
[115:37.55]Let me get to 300 and before I go down again, cause I want that extra battery.
[115:52.48]Get rid of that piece.
[115:53.78]What the fuck?
[116:04.23]Gold.
[116:11.11]Ooh, something.
[116:21.52]I got a key.
[116:24.83]What's a key do?
[116:33.34]Opens something.
[116:41.73]I'm invested in this game.
[116:43.55]I'm very curious how it ends.
[116:52.68]Okay, I gotta go up.
[116:53.72]Give me that gold.
[116:54.38]It's gold right there.
[116:58.24]Uh-oh.
[116:59.28]Alright, driving this thing around is kind of a pain in the ass.
[117:09.89]I'm good.
[117:21.86]Alright.
[117:23.30]I'm almost at max upgrade for the shovel.
[117:25.32]Should I get max upgrade?
[117:30.25]I'm thinking we do max upgrade.
[117:33.13]Chest.
[117:34.61]Is there a chest in here?
[117:37.91]Oh, shit.
[117:38.73]Ooh.
[117:40.19]I need two keys to open that.
[117:41.33]Alright.
[117:41.57]I got to find out the key right now.
[117:53.24]All the way down, right?
[117:53.94]A little bit more.
[118:03.54]That battery lasts a lifetime now.
[118:10.49]Okay, let me blow this up.
[118:19.67]I'm just getting gold randomly down here.
[118:21.31]There's so much money down here.
[118:25.52]I'm fine.
[118:28.32]Didn't even need to freak out for no reason.
[118:29.66]Gold.
[118:46.91]I'll take some more gold.
[118:47.91]I'll take a thousand bucks worth of gold right now.
[118:49.79]That'd be great.
[119:00.80]It was my computer.
[119:01.52]I reloaded the page and you no longer sound like a rat.
[119:03.76]You literally sounded so high pitched as if you were sped up.
[119:06.62]It was a bug.
[119:12.66]You just thought I was messing.
[119:13.94]Oh, that's funny.
[119:19.08]Oh, okay.
[119:19.74]Another place to go.
[119:25.67]I'll investigate it next time.
[119:26.71]I want that last piece of gold though.
[119:32.03]What is that?
[119:34.89]Is this lava?
[119:35.59]Alright, hold on.
[119:37.73]There's lava down here.
[119:38.65]I gotta get the lava boots.
[119:40.25]250 bucks.
[119:54.34]Nice.
[120:02.47]Mmm, get back.
[120:03.47]It's safer.
[120:15.66]I'm surprised it goes down this far.
[120:17.00]Alright, so what the hell is down here?
[120:31.76]Can I get killed by this lava?
[120:32.90]Probably.
[120:33.30]I just found platinum.
[120:50.27]That is a long way down.
[121:00.18]Platinum.
[121:01.04]Platinum right there too.
[121:01.96]How far down does this go?
[121:04.08]Oh.
[121:08.44]I'm curious about this.
[121:16.87]Ouch.
[121:18.85]Alright, it does hurt.
[121:26.47]You should blow it up.
[121:47.62]That didn't do anything.
[121:56.33]Alright, there's a ton of gold down here.
[121:58.17]Let me just get it before I just go immediately back up.
[122:04.90]Look at how much this every single look gold, gold, gold, gold down here too.
[122:12.27]I saw it.
[122:12.81]Yep.
[122:13.87]Gold, gold, gold.
[122:16.49]Alright, get out.
[122:17.63]I have so much silver.
[122:27.62]This thing is so much faster now.
[122:29.06]Thank goodness.
[122:32.20]Alright, so I don't know if that... How much did that take at the bar?
[122:35.80]That was only like 10% of the bar.
[122:36.96]I can stay down for a little bit longer.
[122:38.04]I have an omega battery now.
[122:50.09]Okay.
[123:08.73]I want to get another key.
[123:22.53]Even further.
[123:24.33]Alright, so something is here.
[123:25.73]I wonder if it's a key.
[123:29.13]Up.
[123:41.42]Ooh.
[123:47.32]Ooh.
[123:49.06]Get out of the way.
[123:52.69]What am I stuck on?
[123:59.47]Okay.
[124:07.08]Up.
[124:11.90]Where are you?
[124:12.64]I thought that was a ton of gold.
[124:35.52]You ever beat Terraria?
[124:37.26]Uh, I watched Ster beat it.
[124:40.80]Stern and I streamed the entirety of, I think there were like 30 mods on the game.
[124:46.58]And he would just kind of throw me items that were kind of useful.
[124:51.22]And I would attack the boss sometimes.
[124:54.84]And he'd be like, oh, we're going to go over here.
[124:55.90]We're going to spawn this UFO.
[124:57.54]And here it is.
[124:57.92]And then he would kill it.
[124:58.96]And he'd make some cool items.
[125:06.14]This is huge, whatever it is.
[125:13.85]Platinum.
[125:15.75]Oh, got it.
[125:16.25]Here it is.
[125:16.73]Alright, nice.
[125:18.29]Hopefully it's another key.
[125:37.74]What's in it?
[125:39.94]I got dynamite, right?
[125:40.80]Shit, I don't.
[125:41.30]I'm gonna have to clear it.
[125:49.76]Maybe not.
[125:50.32]Can I get through?
[125:53.04]Doesn't look like I can.
[125:59.77]What about The Long Drive?
[126:02.37]I would play The Long Drive again.
[126:03.43]I want to play that... What's it called?
[126:10.87]Motor Town or something?
[126:16.37]I asked Poke about it last stream.
[126:18.55]He said it was very good.
[126:22.67]I need dynamite.
[126:26.03]Good luck getting out of here.
[126:41.22]Just wanna make sure I can see it when I come back.
[126:48.13]What time you doing it?
[126:48.83]Um, 20-30 minutes.
[126:53.26]I think we said four o'clock.
[126:58.08]Damn.
[126:59.12]Alright.
[127:00.02]I can upgrade some more shit.
[127:01.18]I'm going to take two.
[127:07.88]I'm going to take three dynamites just in case.
[127:19.57]Ouch.
[127:22.56]Just blow them off.
[127:23.74]This is more important.
[127:28.26]No, no, no, no.
[127:30.00]That's not true.
[127:32.20]I'm really... I want to play the other game.
[127:35.15]Seems interesting.
[127:39.61]Okay, so... Here.
[127:50.77]Hopefully that's all I needed to do.
[127:51.97]Now, see, this is why I brought three.
[127:54.61]It's definitely going to be three dynamites or more.
[127:58.47]Nice.
[128:17.78]What's in this one?
[128:21.96]Dynamite lamp and 541 bucks.
[128:24.64]Nice.
[128:25.68]Cool.
[128:30.78]Maybe I'll be able to afford the.
[128:33.10]The crazy one.
[128:48.72]This looks intriguing.
[128:56.67]Is it intriguing or is it just the side of the house?
[129:07.20]Yo, am I gonna hit bedrock?
[129:18.26]Roar.
[129:21.17]Roar.
[129:34.00]It's time for a bath.
[129:36.68]Yes, it is.
[129:37.34]It's so funny how I can just turn you so quickly.
[129:52.63]I can flip you instantly.
[129:56.61]Oh my god, that one didn't go well.
[129:58.31]That one, a lot of minus 2s.
[130:00.21]I can turn you in a second.
[130:11.27]Watch this.
[130:16.41]Five.
[130:28.60]Okay, for a second I thought I only had control over three of you.
[130:31.33]I was like, oh shit, I guess I don't have that much influence after all.
[130:50.92]Platinum.
[130:52.08]I want that super drill.
[130:57.49]Silver.
[131:01.86]This might be the equivalent of bedrock.
[131:26.96]How do I get out of here?
[131:50.83]Good.
[131:51.59]800.
[131:51.63]What, almost 900?
[131:52.27]I'm going to do that.
[132:01.22]I'll wait for the drill.
[132:06.64]Alright.
[132:07.72]In 10 minutes, I'm going to take another quick break and I'm going to prepare.
[132:15.26]I guarantee you I will come back to this.
[132:18.64]I may even come back to this later tonight.
[132:24.68]I feel like I'm pretty close to doing a big major thing.
[132:30.59]We'll see.
[132:33.41]I like this game.
[132:34.27]This game is pretty chill.
[132:35.16]It's very nice.
[132:57.64]It's like sorcery.
[133:00.06]Well, to be fair, I played almost all of sorcery.
[133:02.70]I just didn't do the final half of the last one.
[133:08.81]Oh, goodness.
[133:10.33]This is far down.
[133:11.35]What is this?
[133:21.10]Is that diamond?
[133:24.04]Finally found the diamonds.
[133:27.44]Is it true?
[133:28.04]Do my eyes deceive me?
[133:35.20]Nice.
[133:37.73]And they're everywhere down here.
[133:38.79]Ooh, diamonds.
[133:51.17]There's a lot of shit down here.
[133:59.35]I got battery.
[134:07.43]Six more slots.
[134:12.19]I really enjoyed the retro games again.
[134:13.64]You think you'll do another retro console game night since you're out of 3DO games?
[134:18.72]You can always, always assume that there will eventually be another retro game night.
[134:25.16]Usually.
[134:25.76]It's just a given.
[134:26.80]So yes.
[134:30.80]Absolutely.
[134:39.68]I want to do the CDI.
[134:44.96]I got a lot of old PC games too that need to do a grab bag night.
[134:49.98]Go back to the old school kind of 2016, 2017 streams.
[134:56.08]Where I just have like 30 old games and we just play them in one day or two days.
[135:02.46]I love that kind of stuff for sure.
[135:03.46]I think we're at another.
[135:26.82]Yeah.
[135:28.74]I don't want to step on this though.
[135:29.96]If I blow this up, let's just do it now.
[135:31.48]Hold on.
[135:37.42]Keeps going, apparently.
[135:44.34]I got diamonds.
[135:45.02]I should probably get out of here.
[135:46.04]I have two more slots.
[135:50.17]Come on, give me two more diamonds.
[135:53.33]One more diamond.
[135:53.99]Come on.
[135:57.97]I can see it glitching through this.
[136:01.52]Don't mess around.
[136:13.85]Wedged in.
[136:21.41]Okay.
[136:21.93]What are the diamonds worth?
[136:32.60]What's the most attractive console?
[136:34.72]Holy shit.
[136:36.88]Hold on.
[136:40.67]Uh, the Jaguar.
[136:43.05]Okay.
[136:44.69]I have a fully upgraded drill.
[136:52.62]And a fully upgraded battery.
[136:59.56]So what does that do?
[137:06.57]Yeah, you kind of just vacuum up a very wide area.
[137:09.89]It's a lot of rocks in your yard.
[137:17.29]Okay.
[137:20.21]Let's do it.
[137:24.20]And we will finish this after we play with the four horsemen.
[137:32.12]Because I need to start getting that ready.
[137:33.72]I think we're getting ready here in the next 10-15 minutes.
[137:42.92]So let me get situated.
[137:44.14]Let me get ready.
[137:44.84]Let me call the boys.
[137:48.24]We'll do another three minutes of ads.
[137:49.66]Yeah, I'll take another break.
[137:52.14]I want to get a fresh tea, too.
[137:54.42]My throat's a little dry today.
[137:55.42]Let me get a fresh tea.
[137:56.86]I'll be ready with the boys.
[137:58.46]Four horsemen.
[137:59.46]Fly night.
[138:00.92]I just saved it, so we'll play it after.
[138:02.18]Alright, we're back.
[138:33.56]I already played that one.
[139:10.17]-starting is doing something I'll do something.
[139:11.00]Yeah I feel like we'd want to get into it.
[139:14.00]Okay.
[139:14.40]Yeah.
[139:14.40]Yeah.
[139:14.60]I feel like we could spend time on it, so I don't really have uh-
[139:20.00]I opened up Jerma's chat and I see people typing: finish the whole game and I think that'd be a good idea for Jerma (to finish the whole game). Because- finish it so it's why not.
[139:27.00]Okay.
[139:26.00]What- what game? Hole? Dig the hole.
[139:35.58]I did that, yeah.
[139:36.83]Do you need a foreman?
[139:38.53]I mean, you guys can watch if you want.
[139:42.25]Oh, I'm good.
[139:45.47]Let's all watch Jerma dig a hole.
[139:47.61]Do you want to watch me dig a hole?
[139:49.41]I'm all gamed out, but I'm also down to play more stuff, too.
[139:53.26]Yeah, that's kind of where I'm at.
[139:54.30]That's why I have no suggestions, so it sounds like we're done.
[139:56.46]How about we just play a... We set up the next session sooner and play more games.
[140:04.67]Yeah even though-
[140:05.00]Let's do Command and Conquer next week maybe?
[140:08.00]What do you guys do- yeah what about like this weekend? Or like early next week?
[140:10.00]Yeah let's do- let's do it ASAP, whenever you guys are ready I'm down.
[140:13.50]Vinny.
[140:15.00]Yeah.
[140:16.00]You know I- I maybe you heard from me that I was saying every single time you say you're always open anytime and then you say you're never busy and then it comes up and you're like: Oh sorry, I was more busy than I thought.
[140:26.00]Vinny I just want to tell you I think you're a busy guy. I think you need to start like identifying as a- a busy guy.
[140:34.52]Yeah, you know, you're right.
[140:36.90]And weekends are hard for me.
[140:38.42]So I need to take some time off.
[140:40.43]Those are the only days I take off.
[140:41.93]So Friday, Saturday.
[140:43.27]And then Sunday is my big stream.
[140:46.73]So, yeah, I mean, I'm usually around Monday to Thursday.
[140:49.53]But then there are times when I have band practice, and that starts at 7 p.m.
[140:56.02]That's when we start.
[140:57.22]And that band practice day rotates.
[141:00.08]Then I was at a convention.
[141:01.04]We played MAGFest.
[141:02.10]I...
[141:03.72]I'm pretty busy.
[141:04.70]There's some stuff.
[141:05.58]Yeah, sorry.
[141:06.64]But I'd like to... I want to play game.
[141:08.17]I like game.
[141:09.11]Hey, let me tell you.
[141:11.17]I thought you were going to cry.
[141:13.01]Let me tell you, Vinny.
[141:15.15]You don't have to explain yourself to Ster, okay?
[141:18.33]Ster played PoE for 14 hours yesterday, okay?
[141:22.23]Don't worry.
[141:22.75]No, tomorrow.
[141:23.95]Tomorrow is what I meant.
[141:25.09]Yeah.
[141:29.45]man that's like dream logic I I'm like I think it's cool that star likes to play games and I do too I think I just blew myself up no I'm good what are you playing this is the whole game
[141:44.47]Oh, you're still playing?
[141:45.11]Alright, so why don't we split off into our own separate coordinate, uh, groups and do our own one horse game.
[141:51.08]Yeah, I'm just, I'm just chillin' too.
[141:52.92]If anybody has like an idea, I'll just... Yeah, Command & Conquer is gonna take a bit to get ready.
[141:57.36]Same with, um, probably Hammerwatch is, um... We're probably gonna want to play Hammerwatch for like five hours straight, at least.
[142:02.95]So... I can imagine starting that now might not be the smartest idea.
[142:06.29]Okay.
[142:07.23]Wait.
[142:08.03]Hold on.
[142:09.75]There's, there's a game.
[142:12.90]It's a 1v1.
[142:14.20]We would have to split off.
[142:15.44]I'm not saying let's do it now, but I'm going to link you to it.
[142:20.83]This has been recommended a ton.
[142:22.45]Take a look at the release time and look at all the reviews.
[142:25.11]I'm going to link you guys to this thing.
[142:27.89]I've been meaning to play it.
[142:28.97]I haven't had a chance.
[142:29.75]Oh, yeah.
[142:33.55]I would shit on you guys.
[142:34.55]Yeah, we should play that.
[142:36.69]Now, how do we... It's 1v1, so how do we do this?
[142:42.43]Wait, is it actually 1v1 only?
[142:45.73]Oh, it is 1v1.
[142:47.50]Oh.
[142:48.60]Yeah.
[142:53.90]Getting mad diamonds here.
[142:55.14]This is going to hurt.
[142:56.22]I mean, can there be spectators?
[143:00.26]I think you just watch the stream.
[143:01.45]Yeah.
[143:07.67]I mean, this is a cool thing, but not for this group, probably.
[143:10.58]But it seems like it's going to be fun and silly.
[143:15.38]It's called Straffit.
[143:16.86]Yeah, I've heard good things.
[143:19.62]For the love of God, play Content Warning.
[143:21.44]It was made for you guys.
[143:22.86]I think we played that already.
[143:24.86]Yeah, we played it.
[143:25.80]It's fine.
[143:26.96]It's fine.
[143:28.40]Well, I've never played it.
[143:29.82]I don't think me or Jerma have played it.
[143:31.29]I have not played Content Warning.
[143:34.97]It's alright.
[143:36.24]Is it okay?
[143:37.28]It's a fun day.
[143:38.28]It's like a fun two hours.
[143:39.80]Oh, God.
[143:41.84]What?
[143:43.18]God save the queen.
[143:44.36]Play content warning.
[143:46.21]Yeah, someone was like really, really into it.
[143:48.21]It's fine.
[143:48.67]I liked it.
[143:49.35]I liked it.
[143:49.69]It was alright.
[143:50.87]I don't know.
[143:51.23]It's probably gotten updates.
[143:55.59]Hey, so I'm looking for the second key.
[143:58.29]Is that pretty sick?
[143:59.92]Or is that like, whoa, alright, you're going to get that second key pretty soon.
[144:04.88]You might not need to.
[144:06.42]Okay.
[144:11.38]I am so looking forward to the red alert.
[144:13.08]Vinny, check your DM real quick.
[144:17.59]I literally didn't get one, Poke.
[144:20.97]Oh, here's one.
[144:21.83]Okay.
[144:30.84]Yeah.
[144:31.34]Yeah, Poke.
[144:32.40]I agree.
[144:32.76]Okay, cool.
[144:37.41]Wait, you guys are setting up a 1v1 right now.
[144:40.11]No, no, no.
[144:41.29]I'll tell you, I'll DM you what we said.
[144:44.07]You're going to DM me?
[144:45.83]No, we're actually doing private conversation.
[144:50.29]I want to get DM'd.
[144:52.56]There's a... When does the screamer happen in the digging game?
[144:56.54]Like soon for him, right?
[144:59.28]What is this game, Jeff?
[145:01.14]Bean Battles?
[145:09.64]How much further is there?
[145:11.82]I've gotten so many diamonds.
[145:15.34]Why don't you try and go like a like horizontal?
[145:18.88]For like an hour.
[145:20.69]I could watch Jerma dig a hole now.
[145:23.39]Get every dirt.
[145:24.97]When's the last time you all somebody probably did that?
[145:28.27]Played the Red Faction one game.
[145:32.81]Been a long time.
[145:34.83]While.
[145:36.49]Good replay.
[145:39.40]But I enjoy sitting here and talking about game ideas, by the way.
[145:43.52]Yeah, dude.
[145:44.18]Honestly, red alert is going to be huge.
[145:46.58]That's going to be huge.
[145:47.42]And we all know it.
[145:49.88]Hammer watch is going to be fun.
[145:51.50]Can we bring up like Netflix and just scroll through things and talk about what we would watch?
[145:58.25]I'm down.
[145:59.17]I like that.
[146:03.49]How about Lucifer?
[146:04.03]Are we losing the immersion for you, though?
[146:06.67]Of this?
[146:07.15]No, no, I'm good.
[146:08.66]Okay.
[146:11.34]Hold on.
[146:12.64]Jerm is like so close to being done with this game.
[146:17.78]That's what we were talking about in private.
[146:18.86]I didn't want to say it, but you just said it.
[146:20.68]Alright.
[146:21.18]I have too many diamonds.
[146:23.19]Oh.
[146:23.31]Did you guys do it like this?
[146:28.07]Like a fucking idiot?
[146:28.97]Or did you do like a staircase?
[146:31.63]I did it with... I made a hole.
[146:36.40]But it was like from top to bottom.
[146:37.48]I made like a staircase, but once I got the drill you did, I made a hole, like a straight hole.
[146:44.26]3,700.
[146:44.34]Alright.
[146:45.02]I almost have maxed everything.
[146:49.18]Can you share the game on Discord?
[146:51.10]To Red Alert Online multiplayer in Jerma's Discord.
[146:55.38]Wait, what is it?
[147:00.12]Someone put the link to Red Alert, but that's for next time.
[147:03.38]Yeah, that'll be next time.
[147:06.12]I'm fully decked out.
[147:11.90]This is going to be the end, right?
[147:12.96]Oops.
[147:14.50]Abiotic Factor is probably way too long.
[147:17.80]Yeah, that was... Abiotic Factor is really cool.
[147:23.30]I say that not just because I do a voice in it.
[147:26.00]Do you want to brag a little bit?
[147:27.49]Oh, yeah.
[147:27.75]That's a couple lines.
[147:31.99]34 hours I have in Abiotic Factor, and I still haven't seen the end of the stuff.
[147:36.33]And this is before it even is finished.
[147:39.78]Yeah, see, for that game, I'm kind of just waiting for more patches, because I know it's really good, you know?
[147:44.43]It's really good, and you want to turn the survival stuff down a little bit, so that way... My mod, Jeff, who played with us, said we stopped playing as soon as we got to Vinny's voice acting role.
[147:58.43]Well, hang on a minute.
[147:59.23]There was a lot of 34 hours, though, that we spent.
[148:03.17]Just to be fair.
[148:03.81]Am I going to... Okay, am I going to uncover a giant... Is this whole thing, like, a big subversion?
[148:08.40]This is a big spaceship or something on the ground, and you have to uncover the spaceship?
[148:12.02]Oh my god, he's almost at the screamer.
[148:13.58]Wait, forgot to mute.
[148:19.73]Jerma, have you ever seen the Exorcist?
[148:22.19]Whoa, hold on.
[148:26.17]It's like that.
[148:26.67]It's like Pazuzu.
[148:27.98]I have seen the Exorcist.
[148:29.50]Okay, now what?
[148:31.20]Oh boy, I think I found it.
[148:33.22]Yeah, you found the Exorcist.
[148:34.32]Good job.
[148:36.08]The Exorcist is down here?
[148:37.86]He's down there.
[148:39.10]Hey Vinny.
[148:40.52]What the fuck is going on here?
[148:41.68]What is that?
[148:42.08]Have you ever seen The Exorcist?
[148:44.13]I've seen it, I've seen it.
[148:45.87]I was five.
[148:46.71]Holy shit, there actually is a fucking giant pig in here!
[148:50.01]I'm muting, I've been watching.
[148:51.49]I'm muting, I've been watching.
[148:52.13]I can't use dynamite?
[148:56.91]What am I supposed to do?
[148:57.65]Ooh!
[149:02.84]Grow a pair.
[149:08.61]This reminds me of Bloodborne.
[149:09.65]Can I, like, shove a sword up his ass?
[149:11.53]I don't know.
[149:15.41]The hog war.
[149:18.57]The great hog war.
[149:19.53]2025.
[149:20.93]Okay.
[149:22.19]It's real.
[149:24.67]There is a giant monster down here.
[149:26.27]That's pretty crazy.
[149:27.22]Okay, so what else is here?
[149:34.68]Second key guaranteed right here.
[149:36.58]Bingo.
[149:42.29]What was that noise?
[149:44.91]It's multiple pigs.
[149:46.61]Sometimes I just quiet.
[149:47.53]Oh shit, there are... I can't fly either.
[150:08.03]This is how Superman must feel whenever there's kryptonite.
[150:11.54]Oh!
[150:15.39]Look!
[150:17.49]Yeah.
[150:19.75]What do you think it is?
[150:20.45]I don't know.
[150:23.01]A treasure?
[150:27.57]Would be a treasure.
[150:32.09]Oh, there's nothing in it.
[150:36.29]Oh man, I can't believe it.
[150:37.53]Did I get the bad ending?
[150:47.75]shit I I but I didn't get the key play the whole game again get the key ending yeah wait I have to play the whole thing again yeah on loop 35 you get the real ending no I'm totally worth it I swear
[151:14.43]Vinny, you sound like an 80s tech thing.
[151:17.37]You know, like back in the 80s in a movie.
[151:20.62]P3 elves.
[151:21.96]What did that say?
[151:25.18]When starting a new game, you can now hunt achievements displayed in your garage.
[151:30.80]Alright.
[151:31.48]I just beat it.
[151:32.02]That was fun.
[151:37.17]Alright.
[151:37.67]So what actually is in that chest, though, with the second key?
[151:40.57]Any of you guys know?
[151:42.51]It's an upgrade for your jet pack or something like that.
[151:45.23]I'm not mistaken.
[151:47.49]Yeah, there was some upgrade, but it's yeah, it's nothing crazy.
[151:52.26]Shit.
[151:53.14]Well, I was going to do it too.
[151:54.46]I was going to like go get the second key.
[151:57.08]I sound like max headroom.
[151:58.24]Your chat saying, I don't know.
[152:00.00]That's the one I'm thinking of.
[152:02.46]Max headroom here.
[152:03.52]How you doing?
[152:08.45]Well, that was, that was a very fun game.
[152:11.73]Hey, it was a game about digging a hole and that's exactly what it was.
[152:14.33]I'm going to have to give this an A+.
[152:17.93]The description didn't say anything else.
[152:19.31]It didn't say, oh, dig a hole and then do an RPG or... No, it was just dig a hole.
[152:24.43]That's probably the best version of digging a hole for a description.
[152:27.71]I think that's an A+.
[152:30.31]Mm-hmm.
[152:32.29]Yeah, and the person who made it made a ton of money.
[152:35.37]Good.
[152:36.95]Yep.
[152:38.57]Because it's a very simple concept.
[152:40.53]Everyone can understand it immediately.
[152:46.12]We've all dug holes.
[152:47.24]It was my favorite hobby as a kid.
[152:53.60]Now I gotta finish Nancy Drew.
[153:00.85]The problem with Nancy Drew is, unfortunately, and I'm going to get booed for this, and I know I am.
[153:07.74]The game is so old that it takes over my entire computer, and I can't do anything else but play Nancy Drew, so Discord would get probably screwed up.
[153:18.16]Well, I think we're probably disbanding.
[153:19.85]I think, yeah, Ster kind of already.
[153:23.55]Yeah, I end it.
[153:25.29]I'm just so tired, dude.
[153:26.93]It's so cold in Austin.
[153:29.50]Cold they really messed up the weather the Dems Earth devs Usually is
[153:47.52]Oh, but I am definitely excited for Command & Conquer and Hammerwatch.
[153:51.20]And what was the other one?
[153:53.72]There's two more that we had here.
[153:55.98]There's a horror one you played, right?
[153:58.18]Those two, there's a horror-ish one.
[154:00.25]That game looked good as well.
[154:02.05]I'm down for that.
[154:03.19]It's just, I think, just another night.
[154:07.51]Jerma, do you want to play the Stratfat game thing for like 10 minutes?
[154:13.75]See what it's all about?
[154:15.41]um I would have to get it and download it but yeah you want to try it um I don't know maybe I don't know I'm like so non-committal tonight oh my god jeez that was uh that's my first thing that happened today
[154:40.19]How about this?
[154:43.64]Let's do a 1v1 when we start the next stream.
[154:46.10]Because I'm probably going to end too.
[154:46.88]I'm probably just going to get some food.
[154:48.82]Alright.
[154:50.72]Sounds good.
[154:52.20]I have to figure out what I'm going to play now.
[154:55.16]Did you know it's a good fucking game?
[154:57.38]Coin Pusher Casino.
[154:58.46]Have you guys played that?
[154:59.65]That's a good one too.
[155:03.45]Coin Pusher Casino.
[155:05.62]Poke, did you play?
[155:06.66]Vinny, this is for you and Poke, not for Ster.
[155:10.14]By the way, Ster, I don't want to hear you talk.
[155:12.44]Do not speak during this.
[155:14.56]Can you do that?
[155:15.12]Okay.
[155:16.94]Alright, Ster, I will give you $50 if you don't talk for the next five minutes.
[155:20.04]No, I think I'll just leave, I guess.
[155:23.68]No, no, no.
[155:24.30]I want to hear your thoughts after.
[155:27.59]Like tomorrow?
[155:28.47]No, no, just let me explain.
[155:29.89]Okay, remember, no talking.
[155:33.37]Have either one of you played Withering Rooms?
[155:36.66]No.
[155:37.90]Heard about it.
[155:39.04]I would highly recommend it.
[155:40.16]That was my game of the year last year.
[155:44.07]It's kind of crunchy.
[155:45.07]It's a little rough, but it's very, very good.
[155:48.39]It's just like a fun game.
[155:51.57]I will try it.
[155:52.17]Procedurally generated horror 2.5D.
[155:54.77]It has a lot of... It's like a... You know Clock Tower?
[156:00.77]Yeah.
[156:01.27]Okay, imagine Clock Tower, Dark Souls.
[156:03.75]It's like every game combined.
[156:04.89]Yeah, these days, yeah.
[156:06.25]Is it scary or just spooky aesthetic?
[156:08.97]It's very spooky.
[156:10.40]I would say the scariness is just the actual environment.
[156:13.08]It's not necessarily... There's no, like, jump scares.
[156:15.88]Okay, good.
[156:16.94]But... Ster has an opinion on it, and I just wanted to wait until he... Now he can say what he wants to say.
[156:26.96]Do I?
[156:27.30]I liked it.
[156:31.57]You played it like once for an hour and never played it again.
[156:34.13]I played it for like four hours.
[156:37.05]Okay, well that's a little bit more than what I said.
[156:39.59]The game's like a 30-40 hour game.
[156:42.40]I enjoyed it.
[156:44.98]Okay.
[156:46.34]I don't have a minus one.
[156:47.48]I just kind of fell off.
[156:50.54]It was good.
[156:50.92]30-40 hour?
[156:53.16]I'd say it's like a 30 hour game.
[156:54.73]Like 20-30.
[156:56.67]Jeez.
[156:57.35]Might be too much for me.
[156:58.77]I recommend you guys play it.
[157:00.64]See?
[157:00.76]See?
[157:00.90]Vinny gets it!
[157:03.00]My game recommendation for you guys is Enshrouded.
[157:06.50]Oh yeah, I played that when it came out.
[157:08.48]Yeah.
[157:09.66]And Courtkeeper.
[157:10.30]Courtkeeper is really nice.
[157:11.80]I played that too.
[157:12.52]Yeah, that was a good one.
[157:13.58]Yeah, we played Courtkeeper a while ago.
[157:15.38]It was fun.
[157:15.99]A lot of fun games.
[157:17.93]There's a lot of good shit out there.
[157:19.21]Gotta go find it.
[157:21.17]Turns out I have Coin Pusher Casino and I played it for 10 minutes and I don't know why.
[157:27.13]So...
[157:29.91]I guess I'll play Coin Pusher Casino for a little bit, Chad.
[157:32.41]I don't know.
[157:32.81]Why not?
[157:33.31]Let's check it out.
[157:34.11]Hey, Lava Lamps, we've got to have the Four Horsemen cast.
[157:36.79]This is what we're doing.
[157:37.63]We talk about games that came out this week, and it's like a 30-minute podcast.
[157:42.65]It's the $100 Patreon level on our Patreon.
[157:45.57]Make sure you guys grab the Lava Lamps we're selling, guys.
[157:48.81]And I can't talk during it.
[157:54.39]You cannot talk, okay?
[157:55.75]Okay?
[157:56.39]Okay?
[157:56.65]I'm talking to Vinny.
[157:57.37]I'm talking to Polk.
[158:01.06]That would actually be kind of funny on a podcast.
[158:04.78]And our special guest today, we have him on mute.
[158:10.18]Ster, thank you for the raid, by the way.
[158:12.59]Yeah.
[158:15.11]Alright, I'll get going.
[158:17.49]I'll just play some coin pushing.
[158:19.73]But yeah, thanks guys.
[158:20.85]I really like gaming with you.
[158:22.53]We'll...
[158:24.05]Let's talk about Command & Conquer.
[158:25.11]I'm good for next week.
[158:26.11]I have a charity thing on Thursday, so that's the only day.
[158:30.09]And I probably will have practice.
[158:31.24]Okay, I'll let you know what days I have.
[158:32.66]Alright.
[158:35.24]See you later, man.
[158:35.70]Good to see you.
[158:36.76]Bye.
[158:37.44]See you guys.
[158:38.40]Alright, take it easy, guys.
[158:39.50]Thanks for playing, obviously.
[158:40.62]You guys are obviously fun to play.
[158:43.65]We'll do more shit.
[158:44.67]We'll do it sooner rather than later.
[158:48.87]Yeah, I would have been more hype.
[158:49.99]I'm just so tired today.
[158:51.33]I don't know why.
[158:52.06]It's alright.
[158:52.48]We played a draining FPS game for hours.
[158:55.36]Dude, not every single game or stream's gotta be fucking crazy.
[158:59.82]It's all good.
[159:02.42]I know.
[159:02.98]I know.
[159:06.11]You wanna play Straftat?
[159:07.33]Yeah, nevermind.
[159:08.25]I don't wanna play it.
[159:13.05]I love Vinny, man.
[159:13.83]He's fucking awesome.
[159:15.19]That's funny.
[159:15.61]Alright.
[159:16.51]See you guys.
[159:17.17]I'll talk to you soon.
[159:18.61]Bye-bye.
[159:25.57]Okay.
[159:26.85]So that, yeah, that's going to be it for me.
[159:30.50]Hey, look at this.
[159:31.44]I completed a game on stream.
[159:35.32]We just brought that up.
[159:36.88]I completed a video game for the first time in probably six months.
[159:44.46]Red Alert's going to be awesome.
[159:46.14]I'm really looking forward to that.
[159:49.05]I feel like that's going to be very, very fun.
[159:51.67]I'd say that's one you shouldn't miss.
[159:58.41]The next time you see me, I'll stream this weekend.
[160:00.71]I'll be live this weekend.
[160:03.41]What's today?
[160:04.99]Wednesday.
[160:07.78]Yeah, either Saturday or Sunday.
[160:12.50]We'll do a mystery game.
[160:20.38]Are you bluffing?
[160:21.12]No, no.
[160:21.70]I'll be live this weekend.
[160:24.86]Like I said, I've got to do my 1 to 60 in one sitting.
[160:28.24]24-7 World of Warcraft hardcore classic.
[160:33.03]Don't stop and just eat nutrient paste until I get to 60.
[160:36.67]Forgot about that.
[160:48.80]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[160:51.62]Thanks for watching, as always.
[160:58.19]Jump King 2.
[160:59.49]Wait, I just got so excited that I had to burp.
[161:03.77]That's a three-player game, isn't it?
[161:06.83]Isn't the Jump King sequel a weird three-player?
[161:11.01]You run into people that are also playing the game, and you can fight them, and I feel like that might be kind of fun.
[161:18.06]That is a, unfortunately, that is a three horseman game.
[161:21.92]So, we'll have to figure that out.
[161:32.84]The multiplayer is a little wonky as of now, but it's still very enjoyable in single player.
[161:36.84]Cool.
[161:38.12]Yeah, there's lots of stuff to play.
[161:40.38]Lots of stuff to do.
[161:43.86]But that will be for another day.
[161:54.74]See you later.
[161:58.00]What about Roblox?
[161:59.76]If I played Roblox again, it would definitely be like we did last time, where Poke kind of had all these fun, cool things to look at.
[162:09.31]And I'm imagining VRChat would be like that too.
[162:11.29]Because Poke has that eye.
[162:14.45]You know what I mean?
[162:15.67]He's got that eye for interesting, kind of fun spaces like that.
[162:22.10]so I think that would be a poke quarterback stream yeah Vinny has been he's done a bunch of those too yeah there are a lot of great VRChat worlds since the last time you played that's right VRJosh it is in your name
[162:49.68]I feel like you probably have a few recommendations as well for VR.
[163:01.37]Please do the WoW hardcore stream.
[163:08.92]What about Exanima?
[163:12.77]That's the game where you use physics to fight Diablo.
[163:16.71]A long time ago I played it.
[163:18.21]I'm sure it's been updated a thousand more times with way more content by now.
[163:26.74]I'm making a list.
[163:27.88]I'm compiling a big list of games to play, so there'll be plenty of stuff to do.
[163:41.27]See, that's the best part about streaming is this kind of really just like a never ending supply of just stuff to do.
[163:50.70]And that's like, it's encouraging, right?
[163:53.25]It's like lots of stuff to still see.
[163:56.65]Years ago, I thought that I was just going to run out of stuff to do.
[164:02.04]I played every PlayStation 1 game, PlayStation 2 game.
[164:04.89]I played every PlayStation 3.
[164:05.85]I've done everything.
[164:07.59]And I'm talking about this is back on YouTube.
[164:12.57]2015, 2014.
[164:12.63]I was thinking this.
[164:15.37]There is so much more stuff.
[164:18.15]You just got to go look for it.
[164:25.86]Do a Four Horsemen Nikki stream.
[164:28.84]Oh, man.
[164:31.83]I feel like they could come up with some banger outfits.
[164:42.71]I know all the Infinity Nikki fans, I've been stringing you along for weeks.
[164:49.72]I will do that stream.
[164:51.24]You will see it.
[165:00.81]Alright guys, take it easy.
[165:01.97]See you soon.
[165:05.90]Have a good rest of your night.
[165:07.34]I'm gonna get some food.
[165:08.04]See you later.
[165:45.67]you
