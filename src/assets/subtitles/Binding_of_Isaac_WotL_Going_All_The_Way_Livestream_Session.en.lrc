[00:02.27]Okay.
[00:03.27]So, guys.
[00:06.56]Welcome to Binding of Isaac.
[00:09.48]My playthrough.
[00:10.78]Or my first one, I guess.
[00:14.90]Ooh, I got the eye.
[00:15.64]The pinky eye.
[00:18.18]I forget what this thing does.
[00:23.14]TF2 would not work.
[00:25.46]I couldn't get it to... I couldn't stream it for some reason.
[00:28.66]It was all laggy and glitchy and crazy and I couldn't do anything about it.
[00:34.30]I'm gonna have to figure out why that's happening, because that's not good at all!
[00:38.26]Not at all, you have nothing for me.
[00:43.34]I didn't really find anything besides the... Oh, a chance to do poison, that's pretty sick.
[00:49.56]We don't have any bombs or anything, looks like we just gotta go fight the boss.
[00:54.62]Cane versus pin.
[00:56.12]Alright, pin, what you got?
[00:58.60]You ain't got nothing on me, buddy!
[01:02.81]Oh, I see the one that just kind of jumps out.
[01:04.21]It's, uh... It's that green one right there.
[01:06.27]Cool, cool, cool, cool.
[01:10.35]Whoa!
[01:10.65]Ow!
[01:10.71]You know, I wish Burgah Boy was in this game as a playable character.
[01:22.98]Whoa!
[01:28.71]Why am I not hitting him?
[01:29.97]He just killed himself.
[01:33.78]What a stupid bastard.
[01:39.37]Let's go.
[01:43.71]The basement, too.
[01:51.32]You know, I'm not playing as Isaac, so I don't have the bomb, the luxury of having, like, the bombs.
[01:59.80]Get out of here.
[02:01.56]Get out of here.
[02:05.36]Actually, I gotta plug my headphones in.
[02:08.74]That's one thing I didn't do.
[02:10.54]Headphones, you're in.
[02:12.78]And, oh, are you sure you wanna do this?
[02:14.67]Yes, I'm sure.
[02:18.49]I'm as sure as I'm gonna be.
[02:20.69]Aren't I?
[02:24.85]Let's go.
[02:31.51]How do you record games with fraps?
[02:34.11]F9, I think, is by default.
[02:41.74]The Book of Shadows, I love this thing.
[02:44.24]This gives you a shield when you hit space.
[02:46.24]I don't have any bombs.
[02:55.27]Envy!
[02:59.13]Oh, envy.
[03:04.18]Envy's got nothing on me.
[03:06.39]Envy's got nothing on you.
[03:10.99]Oh, and for future reference, if you're watching this on YouTube, and I'm responding to random questions on the stream, so I'm not, like, talking to Burgah Boy, or, like, he's not, like, here with me.
[03:22.84]Otto's not, like, in the room with me.
[03:24.80]So, Otto, what do you think about fraps, like an F9?
[03:26.74]Heh heh.
[03:33.63]This is Wrath of the Lamb.
[03:37.17]Wrath of the Lamb DLC.
[03:42.02]Excuse me, sir.
[03:46.67]I love the noise those guys make.
[03:55.02]TF2 is not going to start, unfortunately.
[03:58.35]I have to do some bug fixes or find out why the stream was lagging, like, incredibly.
[04:07.25]X-Split was... It was X-Split.
[04:09.03]I have no idea why.
[04:10.33]It's something I have to spend some time with.
[04:14.38]Question is... Actually, can I put the Book of Shadows on and walk in here?
[04:18.90]I bet I can.
[04:19.52]Let's find out.
[04:21.71]Oh, absolutely I can.
[04:23.55]Oh, baby.
[04:24.36]Look at that.
[04:25.66]And pills.
[04:26.40]I'm Kane.
[04:27.00]Taking the pills would be good.
[04:29.02]Tears up.
[04:29.84]Hell yeah.
[04:31.38]And what's this gonna be?
[04:33.22]Health up.
[04:33.76]Look, you know what?
[04:34.64]I'm gonna get hurt right here.
[04:36.24]It was worth it.
[04:37.69]Totally worth it.
[04:38.51]Totally worth it.
[04:49.90]Yeah, the YouTube chat is not really ideal.
[04:55.06]It takes... When you write a message, if there's a bunch... If, let's say, like, five people write a message at the same time, it kind of puts everything in a queue and, like, spams it after, like, two minutes.
[05:06.14]It's very weird.
[05:06.90]Mm-hmm.
[05:21.00]Secret room, baby!
[05:22.50]Oh, that's a dime.
[05:23.22]That's a dime.
[05:24.76]Okay, now I'm gonna go in the coin room.
[05:29.89]Going in that coin room.
[05:37.23]Let's see... Alright.
[05:41.50]This is a bunch of pills, I think, isn't it?
[05:44.30]That's the coin purse.
[05:48.14]I think that's the coin purse.
[05:49.70]Yep.
[05:50.32]Oh my god.
[05:51.28]And look at this.
[05:51.84]I'm going to buy these pills over here too.
[05:53.60]This is going to be insane.
[05:57.78]Bombs are key.
[05:59.86]What's this one?
[06:01.50]Health up.
[06:02.16]Health up again?
[06:03.24]Oh my god.
[06:06.58]What is this?
[06:08.09]Balls is... Look at this, guys.
[06:09.57]And I'm gonna buy this, too.
[06:11.17]Whatever this is, it's gonna be good.
[06:13.37]Oh, or it'll be teleport pills.
[06:15.51]Yeah, cane.
[06:16.41]If you... Any pills when you take when you're playing with cane, they are just... Then you'll never get bad pills, ever.
[06:23.82]There's a health in that room.
[06:25.02]I want it.
[06:25.58]And I want this, too.
[06:28.62]What?
[06:29.02]What just happened?
[06:30.76]What the hell was that?
[06:31.60]Alright, alright.
[06:34.18]I just put a bomb down right here, moved over and put up, and then looked over at the chat, and then I got hurt.
[06:40.42]What just happened?
[06:41.85]Did the bomb, like, come up with me?
[06:43.29]Did the fly hit it?
[06:45.33]What the hell was that?
[06:48.87]Oh.
[06:49.87]I, like, looked over at the chat, like, what are people saying?
[06:51.97]Gah, I got hurt.
[06:55.18]I wanted to open this.
[06:56.08]Ugh.
[06:56.68]Ugh.
[06:57.94]Come on, now.
[07:02.12]The reason why I'm not streaming on Twitch anymore is because I get 720 on YouTube.
[07:08.08]I'm not partnered on Twitch.
[07:12.04]Because I have a contract with Machinima that makes it so I can stream on here.
[07:19.10]I can't believe I didn't get that.
[07:20.28]I can't believe I did not get that item.
[07:25.68]I'm an idiot.
[07:28.63]Get away from me.
[07:32.09]Alright, so it looks like we got some fruit punch right here.
[07:34.43]Some high C ecto cooler.
[07:37.23]If anyone knows what that is, you get plus 20 Jerma points.
[07:42.94]Yeah, that right there, that green stuff right here is ecto cooler.
[07:46.98]High C ecto cooler.
[07:49.56]The rest is fruit punch.
[07:51.62]Let's keep going.
[07:56.53]Pinky eye.
[08:01.92]Oh, God!
[08:05.30]Why do they have to have such big tiers?
[08:09.79]Okay, I got the Book of Shadow again.
[08:14.27]I got the Book of Shadows.
[08:19.81]I need bombs.
[08:22.59]I need bombs bad.
[08:26.75]Get away from me!
[08:30.34]A nickel!
[08:36.61]These guys can't do anything.
[08:37.93]Just don't want to get myself hurt.
[08:41.21]Curve the bullet, like in Wanted.
[08:43.61]Oh, come on.
[08:44.25]You're better than this, Jerma.
[08:47.59]I miss every single time.
[08:49.05]Oh, god.
[08:51.35]Ooh.
[08:53.23]Oh, the... Wow.
[08:54.51]Where's Boo?
[08:55.53]Boo!
[08:57.01]BooMan61 is my Binding of Isaac... My Binding of Isaac buddy.
[09:02.56]He tells me all these things I need to know.
[09:09.39]Mmm, Pinkie Eye or Matchstick?
[09:13.19]I think I'm going to stick with Pinkie Eye.
[09:17.09]So wait, the 720 stream is bad?
[09:19.45]Is that what you guys are saying?
[09:20.77]The 720p stream is not good?
[09:23.11]That's, uh... That doesn't make a whole lot of sense.
[09:26.41]I don't understand why.
[09:29.33]Whole lot of weird stuff going on in today's stream.
[09:31.95]I don't know what's going on here.
[09:35.77]Boom!
[09:37.19]Yeah, you got enough to slough.
[09:39.39]Sorry, sloth.
[09:40.87]But you dead.
[09:43.75]Favorite class in TF2 is the Engineer.
[09:50.67]Yeah.
[09:52.85]I just want... No, I don't want that.
[09:54.37]I want the... I want the Book of Shadows.
[09:59.15]Because the Book of Shadows is really good.
[10:02.66]I got my fly buddy, flyin' with me.
[10:05.95]He's gonna bend the knee and, oh wait, where is he?
[10:08.19]Oh yeah, that's right, he only comes out when I, randomly when I shoot people.
[10:10.69]That's an amazing item, by the way.
[10:15.49]Me and my fly.
[10:17.33]Gonna fly away.
[10:19.94]To the end of time.
[10:23.64]Oh no, mini greens!
[10:24.90]Book of Shadows, I had to.
[10:26.58]I'm not losing all my money.
[10:29.04]To the end, these guys are shooting at me.
[10:30.81]Get out of my face.
[10:37.68]Well, the resolution has nothing to do with the chat.
[10:41.48]It's just the YouTube chat is bad.
[10:45.82]I'm not going to sugarcoat it.
[10:47.73]The YouTube streaming chat is not so good.
[10:57.92]Ugh!
[11:04.43]I hate these enemies.
[11:05.25]When you get in a room with these guys, and there's more than three or four of them, say your prayers, because they are so annoying.
[11:11.39]I don't have, like, any money.
[11:16.34]Good luck on your test tomorrow, dude.
[11:17.64]I forget who I... Your name went by way too fast.
[11:20.12]But good luck on your test.
[11:21.44]Anybody who has a test, good luck on your finals.
[11:24.00]If you already had them, hope you aced them.
[11:26.24]And if you haven't had them yet, then go in there and sack them silly.
[11:32.61]Metaphorically.
[11:36.89]I'm going in here to get me some items.
[11:40.93]Ooh.
[11:42.39]Ooh.
[11:43.17]Oh, big problem.
[11:46.75]Oh, big problem.
[11:47.85]Triple shot, baby.
[11:49.81]I killed plenty of birds.
[11:53.21]Look at that.
[11:54.23]Oh, this could be a good playthrough if I'm not an idiot.
[12:01.25]Oh, like that.
[12:03.04]I thought I could hide behind the thing and move, but there was a rock in front of me.
[12:09.91]I need to open this, because there might be hearts in there.
[12:12.69]I need to.
[12:18.61]No, but there's a nickel.
[12:20.85]There's a nickel.
[12:29.74]Across the pond in Wales.
[12:31.08]That's a far away.
[12:32.34]That's a far ways away.
[12:34.20]Ooh, the battery.
[12:37.67]Look, it's just sticking out of my head.
[12:38.91]How gruesome.
[12:41.09]Alright, I got a lot of good items, but not a whole lot of health right now.
[12:43.99]I cannot screw this up.
[12:46.22]I really need to, like, pay attention and not die.
[12:49.38]Because that would be so bad!
[12:51.20]Alright, I got everything I need.
[12:56.40]Can't get to the secret room.
[12:57.42]I don't have any bombs.
[12:59.48]I am not going to do TF2 again.
[13:01.34]Today.
[13:01.98]Because it's just... I don't want to have to do the headache.
[13:04.38]I'll have to try and test it out later.
[13:07.74]Alright, Husk.
[13:10.86]No, this is going to be hard.
[13:12.86]This is not going to be easy.
[13:13.80]Alright.
[13:16.20]Try hard mode.
[13:17.08]Time to, like, pay attention to only the game.
[13:20.24]Just for fun, I'm turning it on.
[13:21.76]I don't want to chance it.
[13:24.58]Bump right into him.
[13:25.31]Come on, bump a cause, baby.
[13:27.69]Alright, we're good to go.
[13:32.93]What is this?
[13:33.43]8-Ball?
[13:39.43]It gave me, like, a rag on my head.
[13:41.81]What the hell?
[13:43.99]I, the magician.
[13:47.23]Alright.
[13:47.55]Doesn't the magician take you to the secret room?
[13:49.89]No, he doesn't.
[13:50.47]It's the... No, it doesn't.
[13:55.35]This game is not free.
[13:56.99]It's pretty cheap, though.
[14:01.59]This game is only...
[14:04.06]Five dollars on Steam.
[14:09.26]Actually, isn't there a sale going on for it right now?
[14:11.06]Or is the sale over?
[14:16.21]Yeah, the no damage achievements.
[14:17.67]I don't know, man.
[14:18.59]I don't think I could ever get those.
[14:22.09]Because you'll get so confident, you'll get to the end of a level and be like, I got this in the bag.
[14:26.56]And then you just die.
[14:29.20]Oh my god, I got rage now.
[14:31.38]Every time I...
[14:33.32]As long as I play this safe, I will beat this whole game right now.
[14:38.86]I can't be stupid about this, though.
[14:40.84]I gotta be smart.
[14:42.06]I gotta be smooth.
[14:45.08]Oh, God.
[14:49.44]The Liberty Cap is a random mushroom every room.
[14:54.40]And this is a chance to have poison.
[14:56.34]I think I'm gonna stick with the mushroom, guys.
[14:58.38]Because I want those random mushroom achievement thingies.
[15:00.96]Achievement?
[15:01.40]What am I talking about?
[15:08.31]yeah I see I got massive like speed increase now and like I'm like kind of little or of mine is my mind playing a trick on me or is this just damage I think it's just damage not going in there screw that exam tips well good luck on your exams I I actually made an exam tip video did you uh did you check that out it'll give you all kind look at how little I am
[15:36.78]Yeah.
[15:37.42]Hey, look, I'm tiny.
[15:40.58]Ooh, get away from me.
[15:42.06]There we go.
[15:45.74]That's what I'm talking about.
[15:49.49]It was a spy video from, I think, like a month ago.
[15:53.97]How you see damage?
[15:54.81]I wish you could see damage in this game.
[15:56.11]It'd be an interesting feature.
[15:59.11]Little numbers popping up over everybody's heads.
[16:04.98]What's that?
[16:05.96]What's that do?
[16:07.29]I don't know.
[16:07.67]Whatever.
[16:08.07]I don't want it.
[16:09.77]Pride.
[16:13.91]Get away from me, pride.
[16:15.37]Get away from me, pride.
[16:21.81]He's doing it too often.
[16:23.19]Will you do the other move?
[16:26.55]Wow, he didn't do the other move once.
[16:29.79]What a son of a bastard.
[16:33.30]I forget what the Emperor card does.
[16:35.10]Boo!
[16:35.68]Boo!
[16:36.04]I need your help, Boo!
[16:40.57]Anytime I'm on a Skype call with Boo, I'll just say an item, and he'll go, Oh, that does plus 25 damage.
[16:48.25]And I'll go, Thanks, Boo!
[16:53.45]I don't know what it does, but I'm going to keep it.
[17:01.64]I have faced Super Greed.
[17:02.76]He's a pain in the ass.
[17:06.05]He's a super pain... How did I not get hit right there?
[17:10.67]Don't ask me how I did not get hit.
[17:12.75]I have no idea.
[17:15.89]I need that heart.
[17:23.46]Take that, and I'm going to get this heart.
[17:27.62]Because I need it.
[17:35.46]Yeah, Boo does have quite a sexy voice, I will tell you.
[17:39.24]It is true.
[17:43.20]I can't get these bombs!
[17:47.79]Teleport you to the boss room.
[17:48.91]Good to know.
[17:49.35]Thanks a lot, dude.
[17:50.95]Good to know.
[17:52.05]Oh, I'm turning this on, because I need it.
[17:58.73]Do I have enough money for anything?
[18:00.85]Let's find out.
[18:03.71]Uh...
[18:06.51]I'm gonna get it.
[18:07.69]It's always good to have.
[18:08.81]And the steam sail, I... Probably should have tried to find the secret room to get the steam sail.
[18:17.81]I think it's gonna be right here.
[18:20.19]Oh!
[18:20.95]Oh, yeah!
[18:21.27]99 bombs.
[18:23.23]That makes me happy.
[18:33.58]Now I'm going to go blow up every damn thing in the item room down here.
[18:41.39]Well, not the gambling room.
[18:46.01]Alright.
[18:46.75]Hey, what's going on?
[18:47.75]I love your little casino here.
[18:49.23]Everybody is going to... Oh, I'm going to kill myself.
[18:55.48]I just tried to make a joke right there, and my brain is too dumb to be able to make a joke and do my joke at the same time.
[19:02.46]So I... Whatever.
[19:09.22]Let's go... Boss room.
[19:14.62]Boss fight.
[19:16.93]Dot com.
[19:18.29]Dot edu.
[19:24.06]Kayden versus Fischula.
[19:27.76]This could... You know what?
[19:29.40]I need to start dropping some tactical bombs.
[19:32.72]This guy can be a real pain in the butt.
[19:38.01]Oh, god.
[19:38.77]That was some dodging right there.
[19:40.31]Oh, my god.
[19:41.31]How did I do that?
[19:44.21]Alright.
[19:46.37]Okay.
[19:48.71]Juicy juice.
[19:49.43]Jesus juice.
[19:53.22]Pretty cool.
[19:57.52]I'm good to go.
[20:01.90]I apologize for the coughing.
[20:04.28]I'm still sick.
[20:08.86]Full health.
[20:10.76]You know what that means.
[20:13.66]Oh, get away from me.
[20:19.89]Oh, that was a collateral right there.
[20:25.83]Oh, god.
[20:27.75]Thank you for saving me, Book of Shadows.
[20:30.77]Appreciate it.
[20:34.65]Okay.
[20:35.98]That's another situation where I hit E right here to drop the bomb.
[20:42.86]I moved over here, looked at the chat, and I would have just gotten hurt because I wasn't paying... Alright, let's not do that again.
[20:51.01]What?
[20:51.69]Ugh.
[20:53.49]Why did... Why did that not work?
[20:58.25]Okay, that's... Good to know that that's here.
[21:02.51]How... Why did that not work?
[21:04.38]Flies, get out of the way!
[21:06.12]You're ruining everything!
[21:09.12]Thank you.
[21:14.04]If I find one of those blood donation machines, I'm gonna use the hell out of it.
[21:25.47]Oh!
[21:26.59]There's nothing I can do to get away from that.
[21:31.64]I hate... I hate these enemies.
[21:35.66]If there's one enemy I hate in the game... Okay, I gotta be quiet.
[21:39.08]I need to try hard now.
[21:45.52]Oh, I'll take it for sure.
[21:50.45]It's a trap!
[21:58.27]Let's go down.
[22:00.61]Let's go.
[22:01.53]Another room with these stupid brain bastards.
[22:04.13]I hate these guys.
[22:07.34]You know what?
[22:07.86]Everyone just blow up right in here.
[22:09.90]Thank you.
[22:14.16]Some might call that a waste.
[22:15.42]I call it a journey.
[22:24.22]Oh.
[22:28.34]Where...
[22:32.05]Okay.
[22:34.48]I think the secret room is... Oh, no!
[22:37.58]No!
[22:40.00]You know what?
[22:40.44]Everyone come here.
[22:41.24]Let's all have a family picnic.
[22:42.90]Come stand right next to me.
[22:46.18]That's how I deal with those guys.
[22:48.84]I got plenty of bombs.
[22:53.71]Oh, great.
[22:54.17]Greed.
[22:56.55]It's alright.
[22:57.13]It's just regular greed.
[22:58.35]He's a wuss.
[23:01.91]It's just regular greed, don't worry.
[23:07.63]Give me that money, and give me your key.
[23:18.27]Get away!
[23:18.99]I'm not going in there.
[23:28.72]Those rooms always give me trouble, I always die.
[23:32.55]How do you shoot at an angle?
[23:34.13]So when I hit up, and I move to the left a little bit, it kind of like curves it.
[23:39.68]So if you hit left and up kind of at the same time, you'll curve your bullets.
[23:44.25]Like, bling, bling.
[23:47.97]You can do it any direction too, it doesn't have to be up or down.
[23:50.51]See, I can do it left and right too.
[24:01.78]I think I'm going to be alright.
[24:02.77]If I can get some more health up, I should be able to kill Mom's Heart.
[24:06.57]For sure.
[24:09.91]Oh, oh, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[24:11.76]I want to do this.
[24:15.14]Don't worry.
[24:15.92]I promise you I'm not crazy.
[24:17.16]Okay.
[24:20.09]This room, if you don't know, because this is Wrath of the Lamb.
[24:22.18]This is added in Wrath of the Lamb.
[24:24.14]When I walk over this, it hurts me.
[24:26.14]For a heart.
[24:27.34]But, it has a chance that it's going to drop something good in the room.
[24:30.16]So, I'm going to keep doing it.
[24:32.50]Come on, keep hurting me.
[24:34.34]I know you want to give me something.
[24:39.28]Oh, fine.
[24:41.80]Because now, I can just go all the way over here and go back to that room where all those hearts were.
[24:47.00]And, I'm fine.
[24:57.62]What?
[24:57.98]What?
[24:58.54]What?
[24:59.12]What?
[24:59.60]What?
[25:00.08]What?
[25:00.58]What?
[25:01.18]What?
[25:03.30]Okay.
[25:06.09]I almost just had a heart attack.
[25:07.41]I thought I could not get back into this room.
[25:10.37]I would have just been so mad right there.
[25:22.01]I don't have enough for the ladder.
[25:24.83]I'll probably get it later.
[25:30.99]What is the sword room?
[25:32.81]The sword room, when you go in there, you can only go in there with full health.
[25:37.08]And it's a... You fight a wave of enemies.
[25:40.80]Three waves of enemies.
[25:41.92]And then after, you get to have the item that's in the room.
[25:47.39]It's pretty cool.
[25:48.29]I just never go into it because I always end up getting myself killed in there.
[25:54.51]Troll bomb, get away.
[25:57.03]Now I can get the ladder if I want it.
[25:59.07]No!
[25:59.87]Stop it.
[26:01.27]You bad pets.
[26:04.52]I'll go get it.
[26:06.14]Might as well have it, right?
[26:09.94]Might as well own it.
[26:15.89]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[26:19.87]I'll have you.
[26:21.21]Thank you very much.
[26:22.53]Oh, I don't need the heart because I can go up here.
[26:28.47]The blue hearts are spirit hearts.
[26:31.37]So when I pick up a spirit heart, it lasts only as long as it's there.
[26:37.34]You see how the red hearts are there pretty much permanently?
[26:41.16]The spirit hearts are only there until they get... If I get hurt right now, it's going to take that spirit heart away, and I don't get it back.
[26:46.72]Even if I get health.
[26:50.92]I'm playing Bobberman right now.
[26:52.26]I feel like I'm, like, spelunking.
[26:57.01]Ooh, the rock.
[26:59.73]Oh, I must be doing max damage.
[27:01.63]Am I?
[27:02.63]Yeah, I'm doing the maximum amount of damage you can do in the game.
[27:06.25]So, that's good.
[27:07.75]That's good.
[27:09.17]I'm stuck!
[27:09.57]Ah!
[27:12.46]I got stuck on a rock.
[27:15.58]God.
[27:18.54]I think I have my book of shadows.
[27:22.56]Okay, that's epic hack.
[27:23.74]I don't want it.
[27:25.35]Is that epic hack or is that chemical peel?
[27:27.91]I don't know.
[27:29.57]I don't want it.
[27:30.69]I hate epic hack.
[27:31.67]Epic hack makes you shoot like those green balls and you can hurt yourself with it.
[27:35.47]I always kill myself guaranteed with it every time.
[27:41.89]Cane versus war.
[27:44.05]One of the four horsemen.
[27:46.19]Oh my god, I am destroying him.
[27:50.62]I am absolutely destroying him.
[27:53.48]Wow, usually this guy takes a lot more hits than this.
[27:55.76]Okay, see you later, man.
[27:58.44]And I got a cube of meat.
[28:00.62]And that's chemical peel?
[28:01.68]That's chemical peel?
[28:02.70]Alright.
[28:06.19]No deal with the devil.
[28:07.67]I don't want to deal with the devil.
[28:09.31]Chemical peel...
[28:11.89]If that's Chemical Peel, then I will get it.
[28:14.58]I'm so scared, but what if it's Epicac?
[28:18.84]Alright.
[28:20.36]At least a dozen people have said it's not Epicac.
[28:24.42]Oh, thank god.
[28:30.28]This game is so worth it.
[28:33.81]Somebody just asked it.
[28:35.95]Yeah, it's worth it.
[28:37.01]Absolutely.
[28:39.15]It is probably the best game I've played for under $20.
[28:42.81]Ever.
[28:46.82]This game's only $5.
[28:49.28]Without the sale, the expansion and everything, I think it's $8 with everything.
[28:56.44]But, I mean, I've spent more money on games that I've never played than I have on this.
[29:03.93]I bought Deus Ex for $60, and I played the game for an hour and ten minutes.
[29:09.27]I didn't like it.
[29:13.99]I never heard this music before.
[29:15.15]Actually, no, I think I have.
[29:17.03]I hate these enemies.
[29:17.81]These are the worst.
[29:18.41]You have to kill their hearts.
[29:22.57]Die!
[29:26.31]Oh, thank you.
[29:27.84]Yeah, this game is $4.99 to buy it.
[29:33.12]I have the expansion, though, as well.
[29:34.70]I think the expansion's three bucks.
[29:36.96]So it's going to cost you eight dollars for everything.
[29:38.98]But there's a Steam sale, I think, still going.
[29:43.55]You know what?
[29:43.91]I'm going to quelch this once and for all.
[29:45.83]I'm going to just look and see how much this is.
[29:50.23]View store page.
[29:53.27]Binding of Isaac.
[29:57.81]Okay, so the binding... Yeah, so it is...
[30:01.83]$4.99 for The Binding of Isaac, as you can see.
[30:04.01]And then the... Wrath of the Lamb DLC is $3.
[30:08.84]So there you go.
[30:12.56]The Steam sale is over on it, apparently.
[30:15.88]It was over a while ago, I think.
[30:24.27]It's a very good price.
[30:29.18]The last time I spent less than $5 on a game, or $5 on a game, and... Hold on, I'm using this.
[30:39.74]Under $20, the last time I spent that and actually really enjoyed it and played for a long time was probably Orcs Must Die.
[30:47.74]Orcs Must Die, I got a lot of playtime out of that, and the game was only $15.
[30:54.08]So it's... Yeah, I'd say it's a steal at this price.
[30:59.66]You'll put at least 30 to 50 hours into this game.
[31:02.38]If you really enjoy it, you'll put at least 30 hours into it.
[31:05.64]At least.
[31:11.48]Oh, Otto.
[31:13.75]Where is Otto?
[31:14.77]My dog.
[31:20.97]And... Oh, I didn't want to open that.
[31:22.35]I could have just blown it up.
[31:24.91]I could have just blown the damn thing up.
[31:28.23]Flat penny.
[31:29.97]No, I don't want that.
[31:31.61]I do not want you.
[31:34.96]Go!
[31:37.92]Ah, what a bad place for these enemies.
[31:42.04]At least I have this.
[31:43.14]I would have taken so much damage right there.
[31:45.04]It's not even funny.
[31:46.01]I would have taken a thousand points.
[31:48.55]I would have died.
[31:48.99]I probably would have died right there.
[31:50.41]Jeez.
[31:54.57]Oh, get away from me, you jumping frog freaks.
[32:02.10]Ah, damn it.
[32:06.11]There we go.
[32:07.43]See you later.
[32:09.91]Ah!
[32:14.15]Yeah, you know, I was looking at DayZ.
[32:17.71]DayZ looks pretty cool.
[32:19.47]I thought it was a standalone mod or a standalone game.
[32:23.31]Arma 2 is like $50 for the whole package, isn't it?
[32:28.76]I need to drop some cash on that.
[32:34.26]Because you need Armor 2, and then you need Armor 2, one of Armor 2's expansion packs or something, to be able to play it.
[32:39.49]And I think Armor 2 is 39 or 40 or something.
[32:43.95]When I saw that, I was like, I'm going this way.
[32:51.51]So Armor 2 is 30, and then you need expansion too, don't you?
[32:58.84]That expansion.
[33:02.76]Let's go, you... Oh, you egg burger.
[33:07.61]You know what?
[33:08.19]Let's go.
[33:09.17]Let's fight.
[33:10.19]Come stand next to me.
[33:10.97]We'll talk.
[33:20.24]Oh.
[33:22.60]I keep thinking that... Oh, bad, bad.
[33:24.60]I can't even hit this guy.
[33:25.66]Get out of the way, you son of a... Ugh.
[33:30.13]This guy is blocking the way of me shooting him.
[33:32.06]You stupid son of a B-I-I-I-I.
[33:36.42]Capital I. Everybody in this room blows up.
[33:45.02]Armor 2 is free?
[33:46.38]What?
[33:50.65]Armor 2 is... Last time I looked at it, Armor 2 was money.
[34:01.63]Diablo 3's real money auction house, I have not even used it.
[34:06.07]I don't even care.
[34:08.21]I was mad about it at first, and I was kind of like, that's a little weird, but it's going to help drive the game for years.
[34:18.90]So I'm not really all that concerned about it.
[34:26.92]Open sesame.
[34:27.82]I think I'm gonna fight mom here in a second.
[34:30.44]Maybe this next room.
[34:31.54]Another dime!
[34:32.26]Alright, let's go fight, um... Oh, no no no no no!
[34:41.41]I need to get some... I get some coins.
[34:47.12]I got coins.
[34:52.52]Operation.
[34:55.01]2033.
[34:56.09]Metro.
[34:59.33]That game's coming out with a sequel soon, aren't they?
[35:02.95]I'll get the compass.
[35:04.67]Just because I'm not going to be able to buy anything later.
[35:06.36]Alright, let's go fight.
[35:09.94]Let's go fight Mom's big, fat, disgusting leg.
[35:20.69]Follow me!
[35:25.19]I don't wanna, I don't wanna go in the sword room.
[35:27.45]It scares me.
[35:28.69]Because if I lose health, and I die to Mom, I'm gonna be... P.O'd.
[35:36.97]Let's go, Mom!
[35:40.25]Oh, what do you say, Mommy Dearest?
[35:42.75]Come on, step on yourself.
[35:44.27]Oh, she, what?
[35:45.11]She is... I'm killing her so bad!
[35:48.29]Ugh!
[35:48.43]Alright, that's fine.
[35:53.25]Go ahead, swap me, I don't care.
[35:56.21]And she's gonna do it!
[35:56.97]Isaac!
[35:59.09]Isaac!
[36:04.72]Isaac!
[36:07.52]Let's keep going!
[36:10.62]Only got two more rooms.
[36:12.86]And then maybe I can go... I don't know if I'm gonna be able to go to Shoal.
[36:15.69]I don't think I've beaten the game enough times to go to Shoal every time.
[36:20.33]Ugh!
[36:21.45]What's that?
[36:22.29]What's that?
[36:22.77]I wanna look at it.
[36:26.08]Cursed skull.
[36:27.18]Oh, boo.
[36:28.66]Boo, what does this do?
[36:32.60]I don't know.
[36:34.64]What does a cursed skull do, guys?
[36:36.17]Does anybody know?
[36:38.93]Does anybody know?
[36:45.21]I need to know what it does.
[36:47.16]Because if it's good, I want to keep it.
[36:48.44]Alright, we'll come back to it.
[36:50.38]I'll come back.
[36:50.74]It's going to be there.
[36:54.65]Cursed skull is bad, okay?
[36:56.66]Alright, good to know.
[36:59.02]Do not get this.
[37:00.62]Okay.
[37:03.80]Chest inside of a chest.
[37:05.00]Chest-ception.
[37:08.14]Get away from me.
[37:10.87]Health up.
[37:12.05]Exactly what I was looking for.
[37:17.07]Oh, it's me.
[37:17.89]Go get him, flies.
[37:18.85]Yeah.
[37:23.56]This Book of Shadows is the thing that's making this playthrough possible.
[37:27.38]It really is.
[37:27.88]Oh, go, go, go, go, go!
[37:30.68]Yes!
[37:33.67]Oh, lord have mercy on me.
[37:36.95]Jeez.
[37:39.57]Health up.
[37:41.71]Health up again.
[37:42.59]Oh my god, you're gonna be kidding me.
[37:46.72]Teleport pills, let's just take them.
[37:51.04]I'd like to thank the Book of Shadows for making this possible, because without him, I wouldn't be receiving this award, and I want to thank my mother and my father and my parents.
[38:03.66]Go up.
[38:03.92]Alright, I'm not going in the secret room.
[38:08.06]Just take a look who's in there.
[38:10.26]My buddy Greed.
[38:13.06]The name's Greed.
[38:18.14]Oh, gad.
[38:20.46]See ya.
[38:25.79]If Isaac's health is brought down to half of a heart, Isaac is then teleported to the last room completed.
[38:33.01]Um... That sounds pretty incredible.
[38:36.85]That sounds pretty ridiculous.
[38:38.85]Actually, but to be honest, even if you complete the last room with half a heart, when you get to the next room after the last room, you're probably gonna die.
[38:50.53]That's still pretty cool, though.
[38:52.39]If I did not have the mushroom, I would absolutely be taking that.
[39:00.13]Get out of here, you spider.
[39:03.89]I never liked spiders.
[39:05.95]You creepy crawly.
[39:11.13]You want to thank your mother?
[39:11.93]She tried to kill you.
[39:13.77]This is true.
[39:14.49]This is very true.
[39:16.61]But I have a short-term memory loss.
[39:19.71]I forgot those things.
[39:24.17]I hate these guys.
[39:25.07]These guys are annoying.
[39:27.01]I stick my head up and then, no, I joke, bye, you don't hit me.
[39:32.19]Yes, I will take that.
[39:35.52]Every single door is now open.
[39:37.38]Down here.
[39:42.94]What's the game from E3 you're looking forward to the most?
[39:50.29]You know, the Wii U... The Wii U is actually really, really cool.
[39:56.49]It's very, very interesting.
[39:58.62]It's kind of like when the Wii first came out, it was like, what is that?
[40:03.49]I think I might just get it.
[40:04.57]It looks like it could be fun.
[40:06.55]Because the coolest thing in the entire world with the Wii U... I'll explain this.
[40:10.64]This is the coolest thing ever.
[40:13.02]So if you're playing on a TV, and let's say you're in your living room, and somebody comes in, and they say, oh, I need the TV, I want to use the TV.
[40:23.89]And you're like, dude, I'm playing a game.
[40:26.11]No, no, you can't take the TV.
[40:28.51]And sometimes, I mean, back when I was younger, it didn't matter how much you complained.
[40:33.04]Or how much you wanted to... Oh my god.
[40:35.70]Or how much you wanted to stay in the room, you had to get kicked off the TV.
[40:39.60]With the Wii U, it's going... They're going to make it so when somebody kicks you off the TV, you can just... I'm using my hands right now.
[40:47.88]I'm not even... My hands aren't even on the keyboard.
[40:49.64]You can... It goes to the screen.
[40:51.56]You have like a... It's a mini TV on the screen.
[40:54.96]So let's say you get kicked off.
[40:57.20]You can just play on the Wii U pad screen.
[40:59.96]Like, okay, fine.
[41:00.58]You can take it.
[41:01.02]I'll go in my room and play the game.
[41:03.26]That's insane.
[41:04.20]That's unbelievable.
[41:05.80]That is one of the coolest things, I think, of that system so far.
[41:09.14]Is the fact that you can, like, take the system with you around the house.
[41:13.21]I'm going to go to this last room.
[41:24.10]And plus, I mean, this might sound kind of, like, kind of disgusting, but...
[41:28.81]Like, how awesome would that be if you were just like, you know, I'm playing Super Mario 15, whatever comes out.
[41:36.75]You know, I gotta take, like, a dump.
[41:38.63]And you can just, like, take it to the bathroom.
[41:43.56]I know, I know, I'm gross, I know.
[41:46.24]But still, like, the possibilities are endless.
[41:55.09]Somebody should actually grab those teleport pills.
[41:58.20]I will.
[41:59.78]No, I won't.
[42:00.72]I'm going to hurt myself if I go in there.
[42:08.26]Let's just go fight the boss.
[42:13.55]Bang, bang.
[42:16.41]The Wii U. I don't like the name.
[42:19.73]I wish they would change the name.
[42:26.78]Imagine if you dropped it in the toilet.
[42:35.78]I can imagine that would be one of the worst things to possibly happen.
[42:41.22]But, I guess, why, how would you drop it in the toilet?
[42:45.94]Like, oh, whoops!
[42:56.51]thought of the noise that would make.
[42:58.06]It's a big thing, man.
[43:04.50]It's a pretty big device.
[43:07.98]Let's go kill mom.
[43:09.14]Let's go fight mommy dearest.
[43:14.06]Oh, God.
[43:16.21]Get away from me.
[43:19.91]You know, I'm not even gonna go item hunting.
[43:21.71]I'm just gonna try and kill, um, uh, a heft.
[43:30.62]Yeah, I'm not going item hunting.
[43:32.26]I'm just gonna go try and go for the kill, I think.
[43:35.50]Tears up.
[43:36.62]I think I'm at max tears, too.
[43:39.46]How am I not at max tears?
[43:40.58]Doesn't make any sense.
[43:45.56]Oh, you know what?
[43:46.40]You only live once.
[43:49.97]You ain't gonna kill me.
[43:50.81]Sorry, buddy.
[43:52.87]Neither is your friend over here.
[43:54.85]I live.
[44:00.61]Wii U. The noises I make when I play this game really surprises me.
[44:12.74]I got back to 99 bombs.
[44:14.00]Are you kidding me?
[44:16.88]Everybody blows up.
[44:21.47]Oh, boom, boom.
[44:23.37]Alright.
[44:25.17]Good to go.
[44:27.85]No, I did not take the Brimstone from the Devil.
[44:30.66]For a very important reason.
[44:32.88]Because Brimstone, that would have taken two hearts away.
[44:36.26]And if I get to go to Shul, I'm gonna want those two hearts.
[44:41.54]And I'm doing so much damage right now, it doesn't even matter at this point.
[44:45.85]I have a very, very, very, very good setup.
[44:48.21]So I think I'm okay.
[44:51.76]I'll get hit by a big rotten tooth.
[44:59.29]Double gluttony.
[45:01.75]Double gluttony!
[45:02.59]No!
[45:04.55]Get away from me!
[45:05.41]Get away from me, gluttony!
[45:08.65]Will you just die?
[45:10.87]That's all I ask.
[45:12.46]I just ask of you to be dead.
[45:15.24]That's all I ask.
[45:19.72]Oh!
[45:19.84]Oh!
[45:22.66]Get!
[45:25.12]Oh, that guy, I almost got a tooth collateral.
[45:27.78]Only in The Binding of Isaac can you say the words, tooth collateral, and have it make sense.
[45:36.18]You know what, I'm going the other way.
[45:37.54]I'm ending this.
[45:38.64]I'm literally ending this right now.
[45:41.44]I'm going into the, uh... I'm ending this like I'm going into... Oh god, I can't even talk.
[45:53.66]Go!
[45:54.48]Go!
[46:00.23]Alright.
[46:00.89]I'm not going to go the other way.
[46:02.41]I'm just going to fight her.
[46:04.21]I'm going to fight her.
[46:07.91]She's got nothing on me.
[46:14.47]And who's in here?
[46:26.18]Dude, what's the Super Meat Boy challenge?
[46:28.22]Ooh, I can... Alright, the real goal here is to... Oh, God!
[46:32.54]No, I'm gonna kill him!
[46:33.72]No!
[46:36.55]I always do that, man.
[46:39.03]I do that way too often.
[46:40.67]Hold on, I gotta text.
[46:51.11]Alright.
[46:52.32]Text complete.
[46:58.43]Jerma, turn around.
[46:59.19]The treasure room can only be one room away over there.
[47:03.91]And... let's... Oh, that has to be right here.
[47:09.26]You are absolutely right, my friend.
[47:12.10]Good eyes.
[47:13.06]But I guess at this point, if I kill Mom right here, then... and I don't go to Shoal, then it's over anyways.
[47:19.79]Okay, what?
[47:20.91]What's this?
[47:21.93]What the hell is this?
[47:24.99]What is that?
[47:27.00]It lives?
[47:28.47]Who is this guy?
[47:31.41]What?
[47:32.21]What?
[47:34.47]Is that like a different version of Mom's Heart?
[47:39.28]Oh no, oh no, I can't fight those things.
[47:42.22]Oh, okay, I'm good.
[47:44.46]Oh, did you see that like, ricochet?
[47:47.28]Let's go, it lives.
[47:50.73]Don't you know it's impolite to text during a livestream?
[47:52.85]That's true.
[47:54.01]But, uh... Oh my god!
[47:56.05]It was my mother!
[47:57.28]Oh god!
[48:01.20]I'm so scared!
[48:02.18]I'm freaking out!
[48:06.78]I'm gonna do it!
[48:07.48]I did it!
[48:09.40]I did it!
[48:10.54]Yeah!
[48:11.67]Yeah.
[48:12.17]Yeah.
[48:12.83]Hey, yeah.
[48:14.65]It was my mother.
[48:16.70]Alright, um, looks like I'm not going to be able to go to Shoal.
[48:19.24]A poop!
[48:24.43]Oh, I finally unlocked that guy.
[48:27.13]Took me long enough.
[48:29.15]Because I played Isaac- What?
[48:31.45]What?
[48:32.35]What's going on?
[48:34.51]What?
[48:35.67]What?
[48:37.53]Oh, dear goodness.
[48:40.20]I made it to heaven.

[49:29.70]Get out of here.
[49:32.18]Get... Get away from me!
[49:36.86]Oh, a chest inside of a chest.
[49:42.02]The Citadel.
[49:43.56]Give me whatever's in here.
[49:48.26]Okay, I have a feeling.
[49:50.90]Yeah, right.
[49:51.82]Say goodbye, guys.
[49:52.92]This is it.
[49:53.68]See you later.
[49:55.42]Oh, if I did not have the Book of Shadows, I would have been done.
[50:00.51]Again, I'd like to thank the Book of Shadows for making this all possible.
[50:06.19]Jeez.
[50:06.39]Again?
[50:12.81]Again.
[50:13.09]Again.
[50:13.71]Again.
[50:17.65]Is every single room like a boss?
[50:20.01]Oh, get that bomb placement.
[50:26.32]Every single room is a mini-boss then, huh?
[50:29.30]Wow.
[50:37.69]Oh my god.
[50:40.89]Hmm.
[50:43.17]Two sloths.
[50:45.09]And a spirit heart.
[50:46.31]That's okay, I'll take it.
[50:48.80]Oh my god, I'm actually... I think I'm actually gonna be... I'm gonna do this, guys, because I have the Book of Shadows.
[50:54.28]I can... I can be incredibly reckless because I have the Book of Shadows.
[50:58.27]Look at how just reckless I'm being.
[51:00.05]Ooh.
[51:03.81]Okay.
[51:10.61]Red Patch.
[51:12.43]Don't remember what Red Patch does.
[51:14.41]Stream!
[51:15.55]I need your... I need your help.
[51:23.43]I could go to the secret room.
[51:30.28]Don't get too reckless.
[51:31.78]That's good advice.
[51:37.55]Red patch.
[51:39.15]What does it do?
[51:40.61]I don't have the time or the patience to look it up.
[51:48.69]I'll stick with it.
[51:50.02]I'm going to stick with it.
[51:54.27]Okay.
[51:55.01]I gotta use this to my advantage.
[51:58.48]Use the guard to my advantage.
[52:01.76]Just like shoot mania.
[52:03.84]No, it's gone.
[52:04.68]Oh my god.
[52:07.62]Gotta get rid of one of them.
[52:10.33]Go away!
[52:11.69]Get away!
[52:14.83]How much life does this one... Oh my god.
[52:18.29]Really now?
[52:23.31]Alright, it increases your attack when you get hit.
[52:25.47]Okay, I don't want that, because I have max damage right now.
[52:31.47]Alright.
[52:33.02]I'm going to take the mushroom still.
[52:37.82]Let's go... Yeah, forget it.
[52:41.00]I'm going this way.
[52:42.98]Give me that heart.
[52:47.72]Secret room already was there.
[52:50.62]I'm going to go up and then down.
[52:54.03]Oh, why did I waste that?
[52:54.99]I didn't even need it.
[52:55.93]They just scared me.
[52:59.05]Oh, Monstro, you ain't got nothing.
[53:01.21]You ain't got nothing, Burgah Boy Mastro.
[53:07.98]Oh, get hit with a tooth.
[53:10.80]Get hit with a tooth.
[53:16.52]That was lucky.
[53:20.95]Alright.
[53:23.24]Is there more than one secret room?
[53:24.46]There could be one right over here.
[53:28.63]Maybe?
[53:30.47]No.
[53:31.47]You know what?
[53:31.99]I am not messing around anymore.
[53:33.93]I'm going right.
[53:34.85]I'm going there.
[53:35.91]I'm not going to do any more bowl snip.
[53:39.60]Going to fight whoever's in this room down here.
[53:41.82]Oh my god!
[53:46.08]Focus shadows.
[53:46.72]I can say it a million times.
[53:52.76]Well, I just... Might as well go in here.
[53:55.80]I opened the damn door.
[53:56.64]I'm going to use it.
[54:01.55]And... Doesn't this do something?
[54:02.91]No, that's the Book of Baelow.
[54:07.39]There is no max damage in this game?
[54:09.41]Well, isn't that an indication of how much damage you do?
[54:14.07]I thought that's what it was.
[54:18.78]And... Two Greeds...
[54:23.76]It's gotta be two.
[54:24.46]They gotta have two of everything, huh?
[54:26.32]It's like double mint gum.
[54:28.34]Double your pleasure.
[54:29.20]I don't even... Money doesn't matter.
[54:30.62]That doesn't matter.
[54:31.12]Doesn't matter.
[54:37.59]Double your pleasure.
[54:38.95]Double your fun.
[54:39.83]That's a statement of a great mint.
[54:41.93]Double mint gum.
[54:44.67]I'm doing it.
[54:45.93]Here we go.
[54:46.35]A cane versus Isaac?
[54:52.96]Ah!
[54:53.40]Ah!
[54:55.23]He's... God.
[54:58.95]I gotta utilize this as best I can.
[55:01.05]Come on, come on, come on.
[55:03.17]Come on, I gotta use this as best I can.
[55:04.92]Come on!
[55:07.90]Okay.
[55:09.76]Book of Shadows, come on.
[55:11.32]I got the power.
[55:12.02]I gotta be quiet now.
[55:13.28]Or else I'm really not gonna do this.
[55:22.28]God damn.
[55:24.14]God!
[55:25.26]God, no!
[55:39.47]Oh, god dammit!
[55:43.81]Oh!
[56:09.82]And I got a text.
[56:16.72]I can't believe that.
[56:18.72]He had no health.
[56:23.09]He had zero health.
[56:29.15]I should have placed bombs, I know.
[56:30.75]I just... I was so close.
[56:41.88]I was so close to beating the entire game.
[56:46.35]That's the end of the entire game of Wrath of the Lamb.
[56:49.91]And I didn't do it.
[56:52.21]Well, at least I tried.
[56:56.41]Yeah, if I got one more of the 20-20 hindsight, if I had done what I should have done, I didn't know it was going to be like that, though.
[57:06.49]Oh, well.
[57:07.83]That's going to be a pretty funny video.
[57:09.51]Hey, here's a full playthrough of Binding of Isaac, except for the very end when I die when the boss has one health.
[57:21.46]Oh, man.
[57:26.48]The death animation started?
[57:28.03]Aw.
[57:30.03]Well, at least I tried.
