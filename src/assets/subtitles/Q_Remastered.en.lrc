[00:24.94]Why hello there.
[00:27.59]How's it going?
[00:28.75]What's up?
[00:35.27]He's speaking.
[00:36.65]It's always a minute and 30 seconds after I turn the stream on.
[00:39.17]Have you noticed that?
[00:42.91]It is 90 seconds when I talk.
[00:44.74]Usually.
[00:49.72]Usually.
[00:54.28]What about Gollum Part 2?
[00:56.28]No.
[00:57.54]We're not going to play Gollum today.
[00:58.62]I don't think we're going to play Gollum again.
[01:03.43]I gave it a fair score.
[01:06.63]What did I give it?
[01:07.83]I thought it was pretty good.
[01:08.45]I gave it like a 7.6.
[01:08.93]I thought it was fine.
[01:12.37]I like the ending cutscene was really cool when you shoot the lightning out of your hands at Sauron.
[01:18.52]That was a good touch.
[01:19.34]It's like a 7.6 or something maybe.
[01:24.59]Although I don't, I'm not like a big fan of the over-the-shoulder kind of 3D Sonic level type shit they were doing where you run really fast up and down the hills and you go over the loop-de-loops and stuff.
[01:34.19]It was kind of weird that they put it in the last.
[01:36.27]The last section was probably my most favorite, but also the kind of weirdest.
[01:39.03]I think it was like seven, six.
[01:48.92]Hey, what's up?
[01:49.24]Alright, today we're just going to hang out.
[01:53.11]I like the crafting.
[01:54.01]The crafting system was good.
[01:55.35]Yeah, I'm gonna stream for like only a few hours today.
[02:01.41]I woke up with a fucking headache.
[02:03.40]And it's just one of those headaches that just doesn't go away.
[02:05.92]So, kind of annoying.
[02:06.86]When are you gonna play SpongeBob Battle for Bikini Bottom?
[02:14.27]He's lying.
[02:14.71]That was a lie.
[02:15.79]It was not.
[02:18.77]He's lying.
[02:27.18]only a few hours I mean I I typically stream for like five to seven but yeah we'll just we'll hang out for a little while I want to play this game called uh it's called Q Remastered seeing some people play this seems like a good uh fun puzzle experience it is a physics-based puzzle game
[02:55.53]So what you have to do is you have, there's a ball you have to get into a hole and you have to use your imagination to get it there.
[03:05.34]They don't give you any of the tools besides your imagination.
[03:07.80]So I'm just going to hang out and play.
[03:18.04]Will you stream for 16 hours?
[03:19.59]That's never going to happen.
[03:23.98]I don't think I could ever do a real 24-hour stream for more than 15.
[03:30.28]I don't think it's possible.
[03:34.61]My energy levels burn out completely.
[03:40.21]After maybe six hours of being on stream, I have to leave within an hour or two.
[03:47.76]Usually eight hours is the end.
[03:54.07]I don't know.
[03:54.65]I don't know what superpowers some people have where they can just be completely normal and fine on stream for like 20 plus hours.
[04:04.45]I just can't do it.
[04:07.60]It sucks to be old.
[04:08.94]Is that what it is you think?
[04:09.72]Am I just old?
[04:21.64]When are you going to play Tears of the Kingdom?
[04:24.02]I don't know.
[04:25.54]I don't know.
[04:26.72]I have to be really honest with you.
[04:28.12]Should I be really upfront?
[04:30.56]I don't know if I'm ever going to play Tears of the Kingdom.
[04:33.96]I just don't know, right?
[04:35.42]I don't, I can't say the answer is yes.
[04:41.61]I know, look, everyone's very upset now and everyone's very unhappy with me.
[04:47.13]But I just, maybe eventually.
[04:49.73]There's other things I want to do first.
[04:52.48]And in the priority list, it sounds really stupid, and I get it, but Gollum was higher on the priority list than Tears of the Kingdom.
[05:04.73]That sounds crazy.
[05:06.81]But do you understand the priorities that I have here?
[05:09.37]You know what I'm saying?
[05:12.83]Like, Gollum was higher on the priority list.
[05:14.85]Not because Gollum's a better game.
[05:19.41]Where is the priority for Project Zomboid?
[05:22.91]Okay, it's underneath Street Fighter 6.
[05:27.33]Okay, Street Fighter 6 is essentially... Okay, I like that.
[05:31.29]I think I'm going to stream that again.
[05:32.35]Yeah, it's comedy priorities.
[05:36.35]Exactly.
[05:39.53]Where is Sorcery on the list?
[05:40.71]Where's Hylics 2 on the list?
[05:43.65]Where's Yakuza 0 on the list?
[05:45.89]Bucko.
[05:46.43]Ooh, that was a bucko on that one.
[05:53.51]But yeah, we can keep talking.
[05:54.68]Let's keep going.
[05:57.48]He's pandering.
[06:00.02]No, I'm pandering.
[06:02.18]Don't you think pandering would be?
[06:05.12]A month of Tears of the Kingdom.
[06:07.48]Only for you guys.
[06:08.50]And I'm going to dress as Link every day.
[06:11.61]And I'm also going to go...
[06:19.31]That just sounded like... I didn't go all-in on it.
[06:23.96]You can't do that voice unless you go all-in, and I didn't fucking go all-in.
[06:28.82]That was... That's... I fucking was told... I was telling myself, go all-in or it's gonna be embarrassing, and I didn't.
[06:38.17]You have to go all-in.
[06:39.27]Because then nobody can make fun of you.
[06:41.69]It's like, whoa, you went all-in for that.
[06:43.71]Nice actual effort there.
[06:46.24]going scat scat scoot is not what he does and it's not enough effort I need to do more I try harder what if your voice cracks during that well that's a risk you have to take anyways
[07:07.05]Welcome back.
[07:08.73]I'm gonna play this fun game.
[07:11.29]See how it goes.
[07:12.57]But, yeah, I... Pandering would be if I were to be... Hey, I'm gonna stream Tears of the Kingdom until I beat it.
[07:19.57]And hey, guys, how about an encore?
[07:23.21]And I play the whole game again for like another month.
[07:26.30]No, I'm not pandering.
[07:27.62]If anything, I'm probably... I'm anti-pandering.
[07:29.48]Don't you see?
[07:40.80]Who are you calling out here?
[07:42.14]I'm not calling out anybody.
[07:43.42]I haven't seen one second of Tears of the Kingdom footage.
[07:46.70]Zero.
[07:48.48]Well, that's not accurate.
[07:50.34]People are sharing the weird stuff that they're making on Twitter.
[07:58.50]I don't want to get spoiled.
[08:01.92]I haven't even beat Breath of the Wild.
[08:03.58]I haven't seen any footage of Tears of the Kingdom.
[08:11.37]Okay, I've seen somebody make like a ball sack, right?
[08:15.55]You've all seen it.
[08:16.29]Okay, I'm not gonna pretend I haven't seen it.
[08:22.93]What do you mean, what?
[08:26.55]Working... What, you haven't seen that?
[08:29.03]I haven't seen it, I haven't seen it.
[08:30.17]What do you mean?
[08:31.67]You guys haven't seen the ball sack from Tears of the Kingdom?
[08:39.32]Hold on, I need...
[08:41.88]Honey!
[08:42.16]Is there a ball sack image that I've seen?
[08:46.68]Have I seen a ball sack image on Twitter for Tears in the Kingdom?
[08:53.25]No.
[08:55.27]She said no.
[08:57.99]Is there like a, look, a ball sack?
[09:01.11]Hold on.
[09:06.88]I need to look at something.
[09:07.94]Hold on a second.
[09:16.02]I can't, I don't want, I'm not writing this.
[09:20.53]I'm not going to type this in.
[09:23.89]Can't you, you can like make any object in Tears of the Kingdom, right?
[09:31.82]Isn't that like, oh, look, the joke I made.
[09:33.46]Look, I made like a bunch of crazy stuff.
[09:37.84]Kinda, yeah.
[09:38.78]That's what I'm saying.
[09:49.09]God damn it.
[09:50.41]I'm hallucinating?
[09:51.43]I swear to God, I didn't have a dream that people were making... Oh, look, I can combine any object.
[10:05.60]And look, I made a penis.
[10:08.58]Am I making that up?
[10:11.00]Did I have a dream that this happened?
[10:12.64]Tell me the truth.
[10:20.56]I'm not making this up.
[10:24.68]Unless I had a dream that this happened.
[10:29.65]You said ball sack.
[10:32.61]Yeah, you said.
[10:33.43]Yeah, but that's why I meant the same like kind of the same kind of bullshit.
[10:44.36]Alright, anyways.
[10:53.37]Vinny made a flaccid penis on stream.
[10:56.33]Okay, so I know what I'm, this is exactly what I was talking about.
[11:00.25]Sorry, I used the term ball sack.
[11:03.72]I said ball sack instead of, oh, you didn't say flaccid penis.
[11:08.76]Oh, those are not the same category?
[11:11.78]That was, I was talking about the category of things that people are making.
[11:18.34]Sorry, I wasn't super specific.
[11:22.19]Alright.
[11:22.91]You guys ready to chill out on a chill stream today?
[11:32.47]You're weird, man.
[11:33.48]No, you're weird.
[11:35.72]You're the weird one.
[11:39.74]Okay.
[11:41.58]Not super... You were super specific.
[11:43.28]You were just wrong.
[11:44.28]No, I'm just saying like, oh...
[11:46.56]I made a ball sack.
[11:48.16]I made a penis.
[11:49.14]I made a flaccid penis.
[11:50.54]It's that they're in the same category of comedic, uh, comedic phallic shaped object stuff that people can make in video games with the right tools.
[12:00.08]And that can like, well, look what I did.
[12:01.28]Okay.
[12:02.82]There we go.
[12:03.36]I made my statement.
[12:11.47]You said ball sack exclusively for so long.
[12:13.97]Why do we have to pick out every little... You said this, and you said that, and you didn't use this exact... You said this.
[12:23.42]Alright, let's go.
[12:29.36]You're digging yourself into a hole?
[12:32.06]Guys, I told you how I literally shit my pants like three weeks ago.
[12:36.89]I'm not... I'm very unbothered.
[12:44.06]Alright, so how does this work?
[12:49.62]What do you mean, huh?
[12:51.28]Oh, they weren't here.
[12:51.98]Yeah, let them go find it in the FOD somewhere, you know what I mean?
[12:56.89]Okay.
[12:57.79]Draw something in the space below.
[12:59.15]Move the cursor by moving the mouse.
[13:02.19]Draw a line while press... Okay.
[13:04.53]So there we go.
[13:06.71]There it is.
[13:09.96]Draw something and have it touch the red ball.
[13:14.41]That is not a red ball.
[13:18.68]That is a purple ball.
[13:23.00]Oh no.
[13:26.06]Hey everybody.
[13:26.80]I have the proper tools to be able to make something really interesting here, don't I?
[13:39.11]It's eyes.
[13:40.43]And here are the eyebrows.
[13:45.98]How do I clear this?
[13:49.50]What is it?
[13:49.94]How do I kind of clear this?
[13:55.03]I have to change this right now.
[13:56.17]I have to change this right now before I get in trouble.
[13:58.75]Alright.
[14:01.33]Touch the left wall with the ball.
[14:02.77]Oh, oops.
[14:03.10]Like that.
[14:09.58]Okay.
[14:12.24]You're a Reddit gamer.
[14:14.45]What does that even mean?
[14:15.11]Like, I just, what do you mean by that?
[14:18.07]Just, like... This is a game where you draw lines and push a ball to the other side of the... What do you... Why does this have to be a Reddit game?
[14:26.11]Okay.
[14:29.86]Touch the left wall with your drawing.
[14:31.40]Draw a stick and let it drop.
[14:33.02]Draw a slope and let something roll on it.
[14:35.58]The choice is yours.
[14:37.66]Touch the left wall with your drawing.
[14:44.44]Oh, okay.
[14:46.57]Cool.
[14:48.59]New questions appeared.
[14:52.59]What is going on here?
[14:53.55]This is a lot.
[14:59.78]Everyone.
[15:01.24]Hell.
[15:03.32]If you solve 7 out of 10 questions, the next 10 questions will appear.
[15:07.26]Oh, okay.
[15:07.60]I get it.
[15:07.92]Let's keep going.
[15:12.28]Touch the left wall with your drawing.
[15:13.39]Oh, wait.
[15:13.85]I already did it.
[15:17.20]I got it.
[15:17.56]Alright, so it's the next one here.
[15:20.12]Take the ball out.
[15:21.12]Alright, we're going to make a... How do I take the ball out?
[15:26.29]Alright, we're going to go like this.
[15:27.73]And we're going to weigh it down, right?
[15:30.97]I mean, that was alright.
[15:36.70]I just have to do a little bit more.
[15:51.00]Get the ball out.
[15:51.74]I'm just going to fucking launch it with this like 5,000 pound brick.
[16:40.36]What's fucking happening?
[16:42.60]This is not a mobile game ad.
[16:44.94]Quiet.
[16:46.80]It's not a mobile game ad.
[16:47.90]You're wrong because you haven't heard this yet.
[16:57.02]So you're wrong.
[17:01.47]Take the ball out.
[17:15.64]Why can I not do this?
[17:16.60]I'm gonna be honest.
[17:40.04]Did you take shrooms today?
[17:50.57]You need more velocity?
[17:52.81]Is there actual velocity?
[17:54.71]Dude, I didn't know there was actual velocity.
[18:00.50]I thought it was based on... Alright, well, I was doing the right thing.
[18:06.98]Make the ball touch the left wall.
[18:09.14]Alright, let's go.
[18:10.24]Watch this shit.
[18:11.98]Ready?
[18:12.10]Ready?
[18:14.71]Alright, we wanted to push it this way.
[18:15.99]So we're gonna go like this.
[18:18.00]Just gonna build this up until we can get it to push.
[18:23.71]Stacks.
[18:43.94]Can I, like, prop stuff up?
[18:45.10]Hold on.
[18:45.82]What if I do this?
[18:51.84]Okay, ready?
[18:56.70]No, go this way.
[18:57.64]How would that have possibly gone that way?
[19:27.93]Is this a bit?
[19:29.29]No, it's a physics based puzzle game.
[19:33.14]Now push that.
[19:34.96]Can I add weight?
[20:02.41]Okay, I'm starting to understand that you can actually do long pieces.
[20:05.63]I'm trying to- I'm trying to make like a hook.
[20:20.04]Why is it so heavy?
[20:31.46]But wait on the end of it.
[20:33.10]It has to hit the left wall.
[20:40.07]Oh, that was it.
[20:49.13]Almost.
[20:54.16]Shit.
[20:57.39]Your IQ is going down so fast.
[21:00.15]You have no idea how IQ even works.
[21:04.80]You don't even know how it works.
[21:08.34]Do it at the bottom.
[21:11.30]Make it like a crowbar.
[21:13.61]Bend it.
[21:15.07]I don't think I can do that.
[21:26.75]This is a left brain game.
[21:29.78]That's fine.
[21:30.86]I mean, I'll figure it out.
[21:34.20]I got it.
[21:37.76]Got it.
[21:38.06]Okay.
[21:39.28]There it goes.
[21:43.81]Alright, now what do I do?
[21:46.69]Now we crush this.
[21:51.36]This is too long.
[22:04.88]I want to put, can I like push it from this way instead?
[22:07.38]Not really.
[22:13.81]Chat, you're losing, chat's losing it right now.
[22:17.33]Yeah, let me tell you something about chat.
[22:19.73]They can sit there and eat their popcorn and scream about how I'm not doing this right.
[22:23.23]But when they get to level seven on their own time, they're going to go, well, thank fucking God.
[22:27.41]Nobody's watching me do this.
[22:30.10]Wait, is he still on chat?
[22:31.12]Is he still on six?
[22:32.66]Fucking idiot.
[22:33.24]You're a fucking stupid idiot.
[22:40.65]Alright, I'm thinking just a bunch of weight here and then connect it like this.
[22:49.29]Shit.
[22:51.91]Or like, can I just like go like this and just punch it?
[23:01.34]Put weight on the other end.
[23:08.99]So there is weight.
[23:09.97]Alright, I'm start- Alright, alright.
[23:12.22]I know that there's real weight.
[23:14.68]Alright, I didn't really know that.
[23:18.26]Now check this out.
[23:28.44]Will this stick to walls?
[23:34.09]Oh, alright.
[23:34.93]This has to touch the left wall.
[23:40.29]Is it possible that I can... No, so I can't attach things, right?
[23:47.23]Okay, I can catch them like that.
[24:01.14]Not really, though.
[24:06.76]How do I get this to... Alright, it's gotta be...
[24:14.21]Catch it all like that.
[24:15.27]But then how do I... Okay.
[24:30.21]Your age is so... Let me tell you something.
[24:32.29]If you write the same thing a thousand times, it's not going to help me.
[24:38.86]It's like you guys, you guys are at like the zoo right now.
[24:42.06]Stupid, stupid, stupid, stupid.
[24:44.36]Hey, can you hear me behind?
[24:45.48]Hey, can you hear me behind the glass?
[24:47.16]You're fucking stupid.
[24:48.61]Hey, just wait till one of the zoo fucking workers comes out there and throws you out.
[24:56.13]Don't tap on the glass.
[24:57.33]I'm busy.
[25:06.53]okay I need to work backwards so if I were to go like this I'm just I'm just curious what happens here and there it is now I just have to very carefully try to make oh you not you
[25:37.11]Shit.
[25:37.69]I almost did it.
[25:38.09]Wait.
[25:40.14]Shit.
[25:47.79]Damn it.
[26:08.34]But how do I get the ball to move?
[26:14.50]I feel like I can just have a ball hit it like this, but it bounces too fucking high.
[26:18.60]Chill stream, relax.
[26:19.66]Alright, that should be fine.
[26:33.04]That'll do it right there.
[26:34.52]Yes, now everybody sit down.
[26:44.04]finally hey finally hey excuse me zoo attendant yes hey am I allowed to throw stuff no no you've you've never been allowed to do that ah too bad too bad I could scream at him though right well technically no oh okay can you get a picture of me in front of uh giving the peace sign and like middle finger can I get a picture of that okay
[27:22.23]Two years supporting this clown?
[27:24.68]Well, that's accurate.
[27:26.56]Thanks, though.
[27:29.24]You need to be studied.
[27:31.94]Because I didn't figure out a physics-based open-ended puzzle level in the time that you have allocated for me to do so?
[27:43.37]This guy had trouble with a physics-based puzzle.
[27:46.19]Study his brain!
[27:53.09]Okay.
[27:56.09]Alright.
[27:57.43]Watch this one.
[28:00.57]What?
[28:02.05]Oh, I can't draw in the blue.
[28:04.01]Okay.
[28:09.00]So I can, could I just go like this?
[28:11.42]Draw something and touch the red area.
[28:19.78]Can I build just like, like a staple tower?
[28:27.78]I think that makes sense.
[28:29.56]And then just kind of.
[28:32.48]From here, I guess.
[28:35.10]Make like a little bridge.
[28:37.56]And then.
[28:41.45]Study him.
[28:42.03]Study his brain.
[28:42.95]Study his brain.
[28:46.37]Oh no.
[28:47.45]Put five balls in the plate below can be done heavily if drawn persistently at the same point.
[28:55.88]What?
[28:56.90]Put five balls in the plate.
[29:07.78]Uh.
[29:11.75]How do I get them out of here?
[29:12.69]Alright.
[29:15.41]Can I just drop like a huge.
[29:17.81]Like can I just.
[29:18.77]Like a big like grenade.
[29:19.63]I think I can do a big grenade.
[29:21.85]Okay that's what I'm going for here.
[29:27.07]Yep.
[29:27.25]Alright.
[29:27.55]I'm thinking big grenade.
[29:29.01]And then once I get them up here, they're going to go like this.
[29:35.11]I need them to go like this.
[29:38.99]Fuck.
[29:50.42]Okay.
[29:53.72]Okay.
[30:08.72]How do I undo?
[30:16.60]OK.
[30:34.59]How do I get them to get out of here?
[30:44.36]I win.
[31:04.83]What?
[31:05.01]I don't know.
[31:05.69]You didn't say what balls need to go in there.
[31:07.89]I win.
[31:08.69]That should work.
[31:18.17]Five balls in the plate, but how do I get them to get out of here?
[31:21.66]I need to scoop them?
[31:35.00]Can I like drag them out?
[31:46.79]Let me scoop one!
[31:50.49]It can be done heavily if drawn persistently at the same point.
[31:56.87]I don't even know what that's telling me to do.
[31:58.97]You need a big scoop.
[32:21.07]Hold for more weight.
[32:22.35]Actually real?
[32:26.08]Wait, are you serious?
[32:28.10]Hold on.
[32:28.38]Are you actually kidding?
[32:32.92]Hold the mouse down in the same spot.
[32:38.49]That doesn't work.
[32:42.81]What do you think I'm doing?
[32:44.27]I'm holding it right now.
[32:45.15]You liars.
[32:47.95]Please read.
[32:51.36]heavily I don't know what that can be done heavily if drawn persistently at the same point what are they talking about bigger ball is more weight yeah I I figured that out it didn't really do anything though I tried this already
[33:24.16]Wait, is me filling it in like this actually doing stuff?
[33:30.95]Like, spending more time like this.
[33:37.59]Well, okay, that's good to know.
[33:43.01]I thought it was just make a ball and it would be heavier, but apparently I have to go like this.
[33:48.82]Inside of it, too.
[33:55.00]It's literally not how it works.
[33:56.14]Alright, that has to do it, right?
[34:37.98]Make a triangle.
[34:52.12]Make it point this way.
[34:59.06]Hey, that kind of looks like Nevada.
[35:00.66]That's where I live.
[35:19.04]Dude, you can't fit it in there.
[35:21.22]Make it smaller?
[35:22.16]I can't make it smaller.
[35:25.01]This is as big as I can make it.
[35:28.89]I can't fit anything down here.
[35:30.13]Do it from the ceiling.
[35:47.66]I can't put it higher than this!
[35:56.85]Get in there!
[36:33.54]Yes!
[36:34.90]Alright, I got one.
[36:36.60]No, I don't.
[36:36.94]Okay.
[36:57.78]I'm thinking have a big flat top like this so there's a ton of weight.
[37:02.18]Because I can't go higher than this.
[37:05.01]And it'll just smash right through.
[37:06.33]It'd be like a nail driving in.
[37:07.70]I mean, that didn't really work, but I might be okay.
[37:23.94]No.
[37:28.12]It was too close.
[37:39.59]Alright, so that... I need more velocity.
[37:42.98]I can't go higher than this.
[37:52.28]Make a true wedge.
[37:58.31]I'm going back here.
[37:59.29]And I'm going to make it a big ball.
[38:06.39]With a point right here.
[38:12.45]I can't make it heavier than this.
[38:17.23]There's no way for me to make this heavier.
[38:18.65]I just have to get lucky and get it to actually hit balls out.
[38:23.32]Like that.
[38:25.06]And there it was.
[38:26.68]Apparently, this was the right object.
[38:29.86]This, like, fucked up piece of shit that I made, it was the right one.
[38:33.76]So I just gotta remember that.
[38:48.58]There it is.
[38:48.94]One, two, three.
[38:49.84]I can get these.
[38:58.93]God damn it.
[39:12.03]One, two, three.
[39:30.52]One, two, three.
[39:31.46]We're good right here.
[40:04.35]I wish that just it wasn't this high because you can't get any real weight or leverage from this.
[40:19.67]Don't even say skill issue.
[40:20.95]I'll time you out personally.
[40:38.06]One, two, three.
[40:39.14]Fuck you.
[40:40.00]Come on.
[40:40.58]Right here.
[40:49.62]Ugh.
[40:50.86]Alright.
[40:51.30]I need literally one more.
[41:01.05]There it is.
[41:02.41]Get out of here.
[41:04.99]Aerodynamic Andy.
[41:06.11]Aerodynamic Andy.
[41:10.76]Take the ball out.
[41:12.52]You got it.
[41:36.31]That was embarrassing.
[41:38.25]Well, here's the thing.
[41:39.29]It wasn't embarrassing for me.
[41:41.49]So you are putting, you are putting on embarrassment on me that I do not have.
[41:48.36]I'm fine.
[41:49.38]I feel great.
[41:52.92]I feel good.
[42:15.72]Why did I think that was going to happen?
[42:27.41]Pull it down.
[42:28.09]Come on.
[42:42.86]Check this out.
[42:48.54]Fall backwards.
[42:50.02]Fall- Why is it falling forwards?
[42:59.69]Fall backwards!
[43:00.41]This guy does not get physics.
[43:12.58]It is you.
[43:14.30]It is you.
[43:16.12]What do you know?
[43:17.42]What do you know about physics?
[43:20.18]Did you write a paper on it?
[43:27.69]What do you know about aerodynamics?
[43:29.63]I have an idea.
[43:44.35]Alright, wait a minute.
[43:45.01]Hold on.
[44:21.14]Somebody just said they laughed out loud.
[44:23.62]Stop question marking me.
[44:25.72]I didn't do anything wrong.
[44:27.46]I didn't do anything wrong.
[44:37.30]Pull it back.
[44:38.95]Pull it back.
[44:41.77]What are you doing?
[44:43.67]That's not how you fly a plane.
[44:45.39]Are you out of your mind?
[44:47.15]What are you doing?
[44:52.10]There it is.
[44:52.50]I got it.
[44:53.02]I actually got it.
[44:54.72]That's it right there.
[44:57.22]I win.
[44:58.86]Oh, question marks, question marks.
[45:00.08]Over that.
[45:03.78]There's not a chance in hell that I didn't just take that from mod chat.
[45:07.56]No way.
[45:08.58]Not actually physically possible that I took that directly from a mod who drew that exact thing to do.
[45:18.27]Make the ball touch the left wall.
[45:19.73]You got it.
[46:00.31]I want to make it so it can't go down.
[46:01.45]You know what I'm saying?
[46:04.81]Yeah.
[46:05.31]Like this.
[46:07.95]I want to, why can I draw where I want to draw?
[46:10.21]Alright.
[46:12.01]So now it can't go this way.
[46:15.67]So it has to just go.
[46:24.76]Looks in the right spot.
[46:26.28]Like I'm playing a claw machine.
[46:30.47]There it is.
[46:33.13]You question marking.
[46:33.93]I just beat it.
[46:34.57]I don't know.
[46:45.82]I have no idea.
[47:05.81]I almost need to see this first.
[47:08.37]I need to... Because it needs to be heavy here to fall this way hard to launch this up.
[47:16.19]But how do I get that to actually do... Like, do I have to do... I need to draw it.
[47:21.49]I wish there was, like, a paint mode.
[47:28.39]Because if I go, like, this, will it, like... No.
[47:33.74]No.
[47:37.48]I need a like a thing to just launch it up.
[48:02.40]Oh!
[48:11.86]Oh, what do you know about that?
[48:13.20]Huh?
[48:15.02]Oh, shit.
[48:15.93]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[48:51.13]I don't, I don't know how this works.
[48:55.21]I don't have a physics degree.
[48:56.67]Okay.
[48:57.01]I don't.
[48:58.23]Do you understand like where leverage points are to pick up a toy on the ground?
[49:02.65]It needs to be further out like here.
[49:21.54]What are you- I didn't want to hit space, idiot.
[49:39.88]This end on the right side, this side has to be longer than this side.
[49:43.06]How the fuck am I going to do that?
[49:44.04]Hold on.
[49:56.91]It's so funny going over and looking at the chat here.
[49:59.74]It's just people screaming their interpretation of what they think I should do.
[50:04.62]You're tapping on the glass right now.
[50:07.16]How am I supposed to read any of this?
[50:14.28]How did I graduate?
[50:15.12]I didn't go to college for physics.
[50:20.29]I didn't go to school for physics?
[50:23.69]Huh?
[50:29.44]Bro, I can't believe you graduated from your physics math college.
[50:34.08]I didn't.
[50:34.48]That's it right there.
[51:03.80]Come on, grab him.
[51:10.54]No, there's too much.
[51:11.38]It's got to be like a bow in the middle.
[51:13.68]Right there.
[51:22.01]Bang.
[51:28.11]Don't forget about the counterweight.
[51:39.13]I almost had it.
[51:49.73]Okay, shh, we're almost there.
[52:22.66]shit I can't make him stand up alright that's gonna be bigger
[52:56.48]I didn't want to hold stop a little too long yeah ah that's gonna be way easier why did I not why would I do not
[53:25.24]This is going to work in only like a couple of tries.
[53:41.92]Why did I overcomplicate this?
[53:44.00]This is so much easier.
[53:52.84]Oh my God.
[54:17.61]I heard that from across the whole fucking... I heard that from far away.
[54:20.77]That was really far away.
[54:25.19]What?
[54:25.33]What?
[54:25.49]There it is.
[54:25.92]Don't fall forward!
[54:26.70]Have... No!
[54:47.89]Stop this shit at once.
[54:50.15]I'm sorry.
[54:55.42]Oh, wait, no, no, no.
[54:56.46]I got it. I got it. I got it.
[55:01.02]Just stay right there.
[55:01.74]We're fine.
[55:09.73]Draw something and touch the red area.
[55:11.23]You got it.
[55:32.15]Yeah, don't worry.
[55:32.79]I know how to get up there.
[55:33.95]I've played Tetris before and lost every time.
[55:36.10]I have an idea.
[55:40.36]I have an idea.
[55:44.68]Watch this.
[56:01.13]Check this out.
[56:01.79]Oh, you guys are gonna fucking freak out when you see this.
[56:15.46]That's the right idea.
[56:16.38]The ball was just too big.
[56:44.35]See you.
[56:47.35]Make the ball touch the ground.
[56:50.59]This is going to take us a little while, I think.
[56:53.80]You ever heard of a square?
[56:54.68]I want that person permanently banned.
[56:58.68]And then I want you to unban them.
[57:00.50]And I want them to give a paragraph as to why they think they should be allowed back.
[57:06.52]Okay.
[57:12.37]Alright, let's just, like, fuck the whole thing up.
[57:13.95]How does this sound?
[57:20.75]Oh, man.
[57:21.46]Okay.
[57:29.44]Is this, like, stupid?
[57:30.38]No, almost not really.
[57:34.05]Hold on.
[57:41.66]Almost not really.
[57:45.96]Wait a second.
[57:46.82]Wait a second.
[57:48.48]Wait a second.
[57:58.72]There it is.
[57:59.04]I just got to weigh this down.
[58:05.84]There it is.
[58:07.54]Oh.
[58:09.32]What happened?
[58:14.09]Okay, cool.
[58:19.17]Oh, wait a minute.
[58:19.67]Okay, we're at... Where are we?
[58:23.69]Primary one.
[58:24.65]Okay, yeah.
[58:25.55]I'm not ready for that.
[58:26.34]Make the ball touch the... Wait, I already did this.
[58:27.66]Didn't I already do this one?
[58:33.68]How's this one different?
[58:35.44]Make the ball touch the left wall.
[58:36.66]I did it already.
[58:47.80]Yes, I did.
[58:48.10]Oh, it was just to get it out before.
[58:54.23]Oh, shit.
[58:54.87]Okay, that is different.
[59:25.07]Just wait.
[59:26.03]Before you do your question marks, just wait a second.
[59:38.64]I'm fucking up.
[59:39.24]Hold on.
[59:49.28]And... Oh...
[60:25.17]Come on, that's gotta be it.
[60:28.62]Yay!
[60:30.02]Oh, not yet.
[60:30.58]Wait.
[60:30.74]Wait.
[61:37.16]You're doing the same thing over and over again.
[61:41.68]That's what I'm trying to... Yeah, you have to... I'm deducing what's going on.
[61:59.95]Turn the music off?
[62:01.43]Yeah, let's get our own soundtrack in here.
[62:03.37]How about... Give me an OST.
[62:07.27]Did it again.
[62:08.37]Guys, that's what you do.
[62:09.27]Hold on.
[62:16.57]I'm not quite ready yet.
[62:24.65]Can I even save this?
[62:28.03]No.
[62:31.86]How about, um... What do you guys think?
[62:33.64]How do you guys feel?
[62:36.16]You could turn off music and then just play... We could play our own.
[62:39.94]That's a really smart way to do this.
[62:42.12]But, um... People will get mad if it's not coming through my stream.
[62:46.69]That's a very smart thing to do, though.
[62:47.99]Alright, how about, um... Something... Pizza Tower?
[62:54.25]Eh... I love that so much, but...
[63:00.62]Animal Crossing?
[63:01.26]Yeah, Animal Crossing is pretty damn good.
[63:03.22]Celeste is really good too.
[63:04.50]How about... Yeah, let's go with Animal Crossing.
[63:10.40]Which one though?
[63:13.98]Super Mario World?
[63:15.30]Oh, that's a good one too.
[63:16.22]I'm doing that first.
[63:17.96]Super Mario World for the SNES OST.
[63:23.11]Let me turn this off.
[63:26.31]There we go.
[63:30.69]Okay, uh, here it is.
[63:33.46]Is it?
[63:46.73]Yep.
[63:52.33]Yeah, that sounds good to me.
[64:17.98]Shit, this is too big.
[64:37.31]What are you doing?
[64:37.93]God damn it.
[64:56.18]Hold on, I'll get it.
[64:58.38]You need enough weight to pull it back, and then you need the support here to really give it the leverage that, like...
[65:07.64]But then... What the hell?
[65:10.58]Hold on, I think I actually just did it.
[65:38.17]No!
[66:12.60]Okay.
[66:14.14]Now.
[66:15.70]What needs to happen?
[66:19.88]Fulcrum.
[66:20.54]Fulcrum.
[66:21.14]Fulcrum.
[66:21.84]What is a fulcrum?
[66:25.51]Fulcrum.
[66:28.55]Fulcrum?
[66:32.47]That's the first time I've ever heard that word.
[66:34.43]I don't know what that is.
[66:42.65]I'm telling you right now, I've never heard that word said out loud.
[66:47.17]The point on which a lever rests or is supported and on which it pivots.
[66:53.58]The pivot point.
[66:55.56]Pivot point sounds way better than fulcrum.
[66:58.24]Fulcrum actually sounds pretty cool, though.
[67:00.12]Fulcrum's actually... Nah, I'm gonna start using that.
[67:02.48]I actually kinda like that.
[67:04.38]Nice.
[67:05.04]Nice, dude.
[67:05.86]Alright.
[67:08.28]Alright, so the pivot point... I need a different pivot point.
[67:12.15]Don't use words that I don't understand.
[67:19.27]Oh my goodness.
[67:21.89]Okay, I'm almost there.
[67:23.37]I just have to fix this, and it's good.
[67:26.54]Watch this.
[67:27.80]This is stupid, and it's a really bad idea.
[67:31.52]But I'm gonna go for it.
[67:36.54]I've ruined it.
[67:37.18]I didn't have the fucking fulcrum in the right spot.
[67:42.97]I still think I can do this though.
[67:44.25]Watch this.
[67:49.61]I didn't want to click again.
[67:50.76]I got the fulcrum point in the right spot.
[68:06.71]That was much better.
[68:36.55]So it needs to pivot here.
[68:39.39]You can't change the width of your lines.
[68:41.35]That's why it's kind of hard to do this.
[68:45.74]Push it down from the right side?
[68:47.04]That's actually not a bad idea.
[68:50.46]Just wedge it in there.
[68:53.81]Will this actually do something?
[68:54.63]Hold on.
[68:57.97]I didn't actually win.
[68:58.99]That music doesn't make sense.
[69:01.39]You're getting mocked by the music.
[69:06.43]Oh, wait a minute.
[69:07.39]Hold on.
[69:08.29]Why do I think it has to be in one piece?
[69:14.58]Right?
[69:14.84]I gotta put the fulcrum down here.
[69:22.84]Alright, now what happens?
[69:32.05]Got it.
[69:33.09]Almost.
[69:34.65]Almost.
[69:35.07]Fulcrum's gotta go right here.
[69:54.69]Okay.
[69:59.05]I didn't want to do that.
[70:03.60]Now smash the whole thing with a rock and it'll fix itself.
[70:21.62]Pull it!
[70:23.53]Oh shit, it's almost there!
[70:25.51]I can't... I think I got it though, if I knock this down.
[70:37.46]Shit.
[70:39.74]Uh...
[70:52.44]Fulcrum is too high.
[70:54.28]We're gonna do double fulcrum.
[70:57.16]I think that works.
[70:58.76]Double fulcrum.
[71:00.02]Hook.
[71:02.46]Into pull.
[71:03.34]Grab.
[71:12.51]I just freaked out.
[71:13.69]I almost had it though.
[71:24.67]Bro, are you... I'm tweaking?
[71:26.45]What?
[71:26.59]Is it going to do anything?
[71:39.92]I'm just doing this to make it look like I'm doing better.
[71:47.62]Wait, weigh him down?
[72:34.22]Just do it again.
[72:35.14]Shit.
[72:38.37]One or two is fine.
[72:45.97]Is that in a good spot?
[72:47.29]I don't know.
[72:47.59]It's hard to tell.
[72:54.25]No, it keeps hitting it.
[72:56.60]Stop doing the claw.
[72:57.70]How do I get it to pull down?
[73:11.23]Fuck!
[73:14.83]The claw works, you just gotta make sure it's small.
[73:17.28]Okay.
[73:22.54]How big should I make the fulcrum?
[73:24.76]I feel like the fulcrum needs to be further in.
[73:27.31]I can't color the fulcrum in.
[73:29.43]And I did learn a new word today, so I'm gonna use it many more times tonight.
[73:41.02]Not heavy enough.
[73:47.29]Make it wider.
[73:47.91]This is the one right here.
[74:02.16]This is it.
[74:05.20]It's got to be in tighter, like here.
[74:14.12]Why can I not color this in?
[74:16.44]Stop doing the triangles?
[74:25.68]Alright.
[74:25.98]I gotta pull it over this.
[74:28.02]I got it.
[74:28.26]That's the one.
[74:28.90]Done.
[74:30.51]Pretty much.
[74:31.61]But now I can... Can I... Can I... Can I fix it?
[74:46.95]I almost need to make, okay, let me, hold on.
[74:49.29]Let me draw this out.
[74:51.05]Here's the fulcrum point, which is where it's going to tip.
[74:53.71]It's going to hit this, pull it, tip.
[74:56.89]So it's going to tip.
[74:57.93]So let's weigh it down here and let's make a line to the point of this fulcrum.
[75:04.57]See what I'm saying?
[75:07.02]So now when it pulls down, it can't get all screwed up.
[75:13.44]So now what's going to happen is I'm going to pull it down.
[75:15.94]It's going to go over here.
[75:18.06]Ball's going to fall out.
[75:37.82]What do I do?
[75:38.86]What do I do?
[75:51.18]Okay.
[75:51.42]I'm going for it.
[75:54.62]Yeah!
[75:55.96]Right when we got to Bowser's castle!
[75:57.42]Alright, take the ball out.
[76:13.81]Okay.
[76:30.06]that's the right idea hit it with a bowling ball
[76:58.22]There it is.
[76:59.82]I need a little extra weight.
[77:06.24]Put Alex in the container.
[77:07.54]Okay, let's go.
[77:11.45]I'm going to do a mini one.
[77:26.10]Okay, now the idea is to hit him right in the bottom of the chin and fly him up.
[77:38.05]He's getting in.
[77:47.25]Where'd he go?
[77:57.72]Okay, well, I guess it's gone.
[77:59.66]Is it too high?
[78:00.50]Is he eventually going to fall down?
[78:01.96]I don't know.
[78:08.02]That's definitely the right idea, though.
[78:11.82]This has to be a little bit smaller.
[78:13.26]Not as powerful.
[78:23.90]Oh, it went the wrong way.
[78:30.41]Perfect.
[78:58.70]God damn it!
[78:59.82]No!
[79:00.60]No!
[79:01.28]No!
[79:01.80]Just wait!
[79:03.08]Ugh!
[79:07.64]I should've gone from up here.
[79:09.84]I got him.
[79:10.32]I'm gonna pull him in.
[79:13.40]Hook strat.
[79:16.44]I fucking ruined it.
[79:56.31]You better come back down, or I'm gonna be pissed.
[80:29.17]No, wrong way.
[80:35.45]This is it.
[80:37.13]This is the one right here.
[80:38.13]Okay, I'm not going to mess around.
[80:40.83]Not huge, but big enough to get the weight.
[80:43.87]There he goes.
[80:45.42]And thank you.
[80:46.14]Clutch at the end there.
[80:53.74]That was clutch at the end there.
[80:59.80]I think I can take that one.
[81:01.82]That's pretty clutch.
[81:04.02]Make the ball touch the red area.
[81:14.50]First try.
[81:16.70]First try.
[81:17.10]I just made a tank.
[81:23.76]Sumo wrestler touched the left wall.
[81:27.36]Got it.
[81:27.82]Check this out.
[81:34.18]You might have thought that was a mistake.
[81:40.26]If I wasn't talking, it would have been fine.
[81:42.60]I was villain monologuing and lost when I had the whole fucking thing won.
[81:54.78]Alright.
[81:55.94]Make the ball touch the left wall.
[82:00.20]Alright, this is going to be interesting.
[82:01.48]Okay, let's go with the tank strat.
[82:06.61]With the long, like, stick hanging out.
[82:08.23]Then we're going to add to that.
[82:11.77]We're going to put a bit more white down here.
[82:13.01]Boom.
[82:16.07]Now, we're going to restart.
[82:17.92]Restart.
[82:28.36]Just scrape it with your weird finger.
[82:33.74]Close.
[82:40.19]The idea is to have the ball right here.
[82:43.67]Be the thing that smashes into the side with my physics-based technology.
[82:49.90]With patented physics-based ball creation technology.
[83:04.99]with patented physics baseball weight technology.
[83:21.94]Let's go.
[83:35.84]Make the shape face right.
[83:37.12]You got it.
[83:58.05]You know exactly what I'm doing here.
[84:00.33]I don't know anything besides rock smash something.
[84:10.85]You know what's happening.
[84:11.69]All I know how to do is seesaws.
[84:21.00]Oh, we got a little bit of a counterweight problem.
[84:50.58]fulcrum we think fulcrum will be good spot ow bit by poisonous snake feel face scaling numb oh good thing we have continues
[85:23.20]This is the one right here.
[85:24.28]There's a little saliva in my mouth.
[85:25.52]You know, it's the real one.
[85:58.78]What the fucking thing?
[86:07.15]What are you talking about?
[86:08.13]It's stuck on the wall?
[86:09.17]There it is.
[86:19.32]Huh.
[86:28.76]Oh, it's a face the other way!
[86:39.63]My family is in my living room watching you play this for an hour straight, and my dad has been getting pissed at you not knowing what a fulcrum is, and now he's yelling at the screen because you're hook strats.
[86:51.32]Hold on a second, Dad.
[86:52.84]First of all, I appreciate the constructive feedback on how, um, playing this game.
[86:58.83]I appreciate the constructive feedback.
[87:01.87]Um, but, I don't know.
[87:03.83]I was about to just, like, start screaming at whoever this is.
[87:15.83]But then, I don't know, I feel like whoever the son or daughter is in this case, I feel like they'd be like, oh my god, I gotta switch to somebody else, like, right now.
[87:25.51]Quick, quick, quick, switch to somebody else.
[87:28.81]And who else is streaming right now?
[87:29.87]I don't care who it is.
[87:33.84]Okay.
[87:35.48]I'm gonna be fine.
[87:38.92]I have an idea.
[87:41.04]My idea is very simple.
[87:44.00]see what we have to do is we make the fulcrum point here add the seesaw bit right here and very easy we get Batman to show up and we crush him we kill the Batman oh joker you have no idea what you're doing you can't complete this puzzle game
[88:14.91]Look at how many characters show up on Jervis stream.
[88:23.83]Shut up.
[88:36.44]Dad just laughed out loud.
[88:37.68]I heard it.
[88:38.02]I could hear it through the television.
[88:40.44]I heard dad laugh at the television after that one.
[88:46.19]And I'm not happy about it.
[89:11.33]What was the point of drawing these?
[89:12.47]I'm just gonna do the hook again.
[89:29.37]What?
[89:45.01]What am I doing?
[89:45.65]I don't know.
[89:46.77]Stop the hook bullshit.
[89:48.01]Stop the hook bullshit.
[89:51.26]I'm doing it the other way.
[89:52.54]I had a good idea.
[89:53.20]I need a way better fulcrum.
[89:59.48]Like that.
[90:01.85]Now see this.
[90:03.43]Now hear this.
[90:04.31]See this.
[90:05.53]You seeing this?
[90:06.45]Watch this.
[90:11.26]This is going to be unbelievable.
[90:13.16]Dad, hold on to the couch.
[90:16.80]Because here it comes.
[90:20.14]Hold on to something.
[90:37.29]Hey, hey, that was very funny.
[90:42.39]Hey, son or daughter, come and give me a hug.
[90:45.81]What a great bonding experience this was between us.
[90:49.13]Exactly what I'm looking for.
[90:51.33]That's what I'm looking for.
[90:52.79]What a bonding experience that you had over this.
[90:55.61]That's great.
[90:56.23]I'm glad.
[90:56.59]I hope the strength of your family is stronger now.
[91:14.73]What the hell is this?
[91:20.34]What is this?
[91:23.46]Is this still Mario?
[91:29.39]This is not Mario anymore.
[91:40.51]Any mods in here that can give me him at this?
[92:00.83]That's a good idea.
[92:01.46]I think that's... It's a combination of hook strategy.
[92:07.02]And ball strategy.
[92:08.72]Two of my favorite things in the game.
[92:13.83]Now that's gonna work.
[92:15.37]That's a combination of hook and ball strategy.
[92:17.57]Maybe up a little higher?
[92:21.90]Make a scooper like that?
[92:33.41]Kind of.
[92:33.73]It needs to be small.
[92:40.50]Even smaller than that?
[92:41.36]Really?
[92:41.58]This'll do it.
[92:59.42]That's it right there.
[93:00.44]Oh my God.
[93:02.44]Make the ball heavier, not bigger.
[93:04.98]I don't... I don't know what that means.
[93:06.80]I don't... I don't get what you mean.
[93:13.09]Was that actually a thing in the game or were people making that up?
[93:26.38]It's real.
[93:26.92]So if I just sit here and hold the button down like this,
[93:33.05]This will be much heavier.
[93:35.55]Give it a point.
[93:41.12]That's the one right there.
[93:42.04]Alright, alright.
[93:42.60]We're halfway there.
[93:44.46]I now... I'm thinking hook strategy here.
[93:46.98]I just have to push this over.
[93:49.80]Here's my idea.
[93:51.02]I don't think it's gonna work.
[93:53.84]But I could try.
[94:02.19]I'm thinking make a long road and just drop a boulder down here.
[94:06.63]But I don't think that's going to do it.
[94:10.47]Put a hook on the hook.
[94:16.71]Why did I even listen to that person?
[94:18.57]Why did I listen to that person?
[94:22.19]Hold on.
[94:22.71]Make like one of these.
[94:26.85]Will that like help?
[94:28.03]Kind of move it?
[94:39.47]Come on, stop.
[95:15.77]Maybe that little dip will be enough.
[95:20.04]Smash.
[95:23.28]Alright.
[95:24.68]This is not horrible, but it kind of is horrible.
[95:27.26]It's too long.
[95:28.44]It needs to be way shorter.
[95:31.51]So this needs to be longer.
[95:32.87]And this needs to be shorter.
[95:35.79]This needs to be barely right there.
[95:38.81]Right there.
[95:40.29]Okay.
[95:41.31]Now we're going to make a... The first hook is too big.
[95:46.37]Is it too big?
[95:50.33]That's my favorite item from Costco.
[95:52.47]Um... Uh... I don't know.
[96:00.84]Cheese.
[96:12.33]I do like the point though.
[96:14.01]Make this sort of like a triangle.
[96:15.35]Have a point that just smushes right onto that line.
[96:21.99]I want this thing to flip.
[96:27.61]It's upright.
[96:28.05]Alright, it's upright.
[96:28.95]But how do I get it to go all the way?
[96:30.39]Because I can't delete anything.
[96:35.99]Maybe a fulcrum.
[96:46.88]Hmm.
[96:48.38]Hmm.
[97:25.56]Need something to wedge under it as it flips.
[97:30.19]Something over here, maybe?
[97:31.11]If I go like this, will it push this?
[97:37.51]I don't know.
[97:58.70]Ooh, no.
[98:06.15]Flip it the other way.
[98:10.73]Can I flip it the other way?
[98:12.17]Hold on.
[98:12.95]Wait a minute.
[98:16.54]Let me cook for a second.
[98:17.36]Watch this.
[98:21.20]Didn't even think about that, did we?
[98:23.58]Didn't think about this, did we?
[98:46.72]you
[99:24.10]My dad is screaming at me, hurry.
[99:58.94]Dude, you're evolving backwards.
[100:02.78]Please, you don't have to do every level.
[100:04.48]But I want to see, I want to try.
[100:08.27]He needs a recipe book.
[100:10.18]VOD watchers skip an hour.
[100:12.58]You know, when I'm watching a VOD, and I look over a chat, and I see someone, I'm just hanging out with my, you know, sandwich, and my, you know, my large turkey sandwich.
[100:22.82]Lettuce, mustard mayo mix, tomato, one thin sliced tomato.
[100:27.26]Just kidding, take that off.
[100:28.70]Don't put that on any food.
[100:30.90]Lettuce, mayo, with some turkey.
[100:37.48]stalling I don't like looking over and people going hey skip for an hour I don't I don't tell me what to do you just spoiled that the stream the streamer didn't you know I don't tell me how to do you shouldn't be telling the VOD watchers what to do VOD watchers skip an hour that's their decision they just did but at least it was their call not yours alright
[101:12.08]Insecure, Andy.
[101:13.31]I'm just fucking around.
[101:44.81]I need to see how it bounces.
[101:48.66]Okay.
[101:51.38]You need a fulcrum.
[101:55.06]Make Alex touch the right wall.
[102:12.17]You got it.
[102:43.82]Okay, when in doubt... When in doubt, just use the hook.
[102:58.73]I don't think I can do anything with the tail.
[103:00.03]There's stuff in the way.
[103:03.61]Right wall.
[103:04.39]Okay, so if I go like this...
[103:32.98]What music is playing?
[103:34.02]A Club Penguin, I guess?
[103:40.18]Uh, what else?
[103:42.57]Use a hammer.
[103:45.41]Okay. ...
[104:06.91]That's an axe?
[104:54.75]What?
[105:03.82]No, wrong.
[105:11.77]Really?
[105:12.05]What do you mean?
[105:29.89]Touch the ground with the red object.
[105:33.09]A little bit of a claw strategy will work pretty good here.
[105:57.26]Shit.
[106:09.11]Pull it off!
[106:15.24]Just have to touch the ground.
[106:17.28]Alright, now I need to knock this over.
[106:28.94]Touch the ground!
[106:30.10]Touch the ground!
[106:31.04]Oh my god.
[106:32.54]Uh... Yes!
[106:34.04]Um...
[107:00.44]Done.
[107:01.94]Don't need a fulcrum on that one.
[107:05.28]Make the ball touch the left wall.
[107:14.29]What do you think?
[107:19.05]Oh, let me talk about gen loss for a little bit.
[107:23.81]So, for those who didn't see Generation Lost, it was Ranboo's show.
[107:28.95]It's a three-day event.
[107:30.69]It was really, really cool.
[107:32.26]I'll just give you... I know that there's been a lot of behind-the-scenes stuff you may have seen.
[107:37.20]But... I don't know how much anybody was paying attention or knows.
[107:44.46]The second day, Ranboo and I came up with a lot of that stuff together.
[107:49.87]So, it was really fun.
[107:51.23]That was a long time ago, too.
[107:59.97]The hook longer on the left side.
[108:02.01]Yeah, I'm thinking like this.
[108:05.70]That's not a hook.
[108:07.34]Now it is.
[108:10.30]I was really excited because obviously Rambo had this incredible passion project.
[108:18.74]And it's kind of just like, hey, do you want to do this?
[108:22.74]And then originally I was potentially going to be in a mask.
[108:29.42]But
[108:31.14]Uh, Ranboo was like, hey, what if we just put you in a bunch of prosthetics?
[108:35.04]Because that mask that I had was going to be, oh, what are we going to, I guess, should I just be in a mask?
[108:41.38]Should I have, like, makeup on?
[108:42.66]Should I, you know, should we make me look, how do we do it?
[108:46.95]And it gave me this great excuse to get into all that prosthetics.
[108:56.31]Alright, touch the left wall.
[109:05.34]And I do, I have this mold.
[109:07.80]It is a one-to-one complete replica of my face.
[109:11.29]Like I said earlier, down to every pore.
[109:14.57]It is better than HD.
[109:22.09]Show it?
[109:23.65]I'll show it one day.
[109:24.31]You need to smash that.
[109:26.54]You're repeating yourself.
[109:27.32]I know, because I'm thinking, and I can't talk and think at the same time.
[109:42.69]But it was really cool to be a part of it.
[109:45.68]I remember that Wonka kind of candy room.
[109:51.12]I remember I was writing it down and I'm just sitting there going, is this going to be in the fucking show?
[109:59.19]Is this going to make it?
[110:01.52]And it did.
[110:01.94]I was really happy about it.
[110:10.82]Hung out with a lot of really cool people.
[110:12.66]Got to meet a lot of new people.
[110:14.96]And a lot of people that I've never communicated with, like, ever before.
[110:18.64]So.
[110:22.40]Obviously, it was really cool to see Vinny.
[110:26.41]That's the first time me and Vinny have seen each other since, like, PAX 2015 or something.
[110:31.63]So that was really, really awesome.
[110:39.06]I'm not doing this right.
[111:02.78]This is making me irrationally angry.
[111:05.68]Well, at least you're aware of that.
[111:09.37]You know what I mean?
[111:09.97]Like, this is making me irrationally angry.
[111:13.29]It's actually really important for you to kind of decipher that this is irrational anger.
[111:17.91]It's irrational what you're saying, right?
[111:19.99]You're being mindful of that.
[111:20.95]That's really, really important.
[111:24.24]Time that person up for an hour.
[111:42.09]Shit.
[111:42.39]Can I have some help?
[111:45.26]Can anybody help me?
[111:46.74]I know what I have to do, but I can't visualize it.
[111:51.00]Yeah.
[111:53.80]Walking around those sets.
[111:56.65]That was absolutely the biggest project I've ever been a part of.
[112:00.23]Ever been on.
[112:03.03]There were so many individual sets. ...
[112:14.73]Now, you know, honestly, hats off to Ramboo for having the, uh, you know, having the ability to want to put on something like that and to be able to be that passionate about something.
[112:28.57]I'd love to see that stuff.
[112:29.71]Because that stuff, it's not easy.
[112:32.41]It really isn't.
[112:36.05]Uh, so, honestly, hats off to Ramboo and everybody else, obviously, that was working on the project, too.
[112:42.11]But,
[112:44.41]It was really, really... It was exciting.
[112:46.31]It was fun.
[112:47.73]I got to go in prosthetics and be a fucking weirdo for, like, six hours.
[112:54.96]And I think... I think he wants to do more.
[112:56.90]I think there's... I think that's... I don't know.
[113:00.10]He seemed pretty excited to, like, kind of keep doing more stuff.
[113:03.89]It's like, hell yeah.
[113:04.53]That's... I love it.
[113:11.91]What about your ass breaking the door?
[113:13.32]Yeah.
[113:17.53]I mean, my ass didn't break the door.
[113:22.77]I broke the door with my body, and then I kind of, at the very end, my ass was sort of... The jokey part that I could say broke it.
[113:31.95]I didn't actually break the door with my ass.
[113:36.11]It was perceived that way because, I mean, obviously, that's exactly what it looked like, and I'm seeing a lot of copium and kappas.
[113:47.73]Alright, I stopped making a long hook over and over again, and do it right.
[113:53.58]Were you actually stuck?
[113:55.92]Kind of, I kind of... Because those doors were not operational.
[114:02.88]It was like there were people that were opening and closing those two doors.
[114:06.30]Like, they were opening them and closing them.
[114:08.66]And I kind of just pushed it, going through it too fast.
[114:13.38]Yeah, they were like Star Trek doors.
[114:19.90]The reveal of the two foot long revolver.
[114:27.10]At least we're making music.
[114:33.51]I'm sorry about this.
[114:37.51]Draw the weight on the left side.
[114:38.94]Alright, I can pay attention again.
[114:54.81]Trevor straight up murders someone.
[115:03.45]Yeah.
[115:03.67]I remember when we were talking about that scene, I was like, okay, so, um, I, I, I, I'm going to shoot her.
[115:18.27]Whoever it is.
[115:19.43]Because the way that that was going to work out was it was always going to have to be somebody.
[115:23.35]Right?
[115:24.17]There were only two or three people that could have been in there.
[115:29.51]So it was like, okay, who could it even be?
[115:31.69]Who are the possible candidates that could be in this room?
[115:34.52]Because obviously, there was the chat interaction and stuff too.
[115:38.38]So as we're going through, it's like, okay, so it could be you, it could be you, it could be... Alright, so now... How... So I have to shoot someone.
[115:53.59]How do I move this?
[115:55.35]This is a mobile ad.
[115:56.26]I know it's a mobile ad.
[115:57.56]I'm skipping this one.
[116:11.35]Also, if you wanted something interesting, let me talk about this, and let me turn this music down, because this is weird.
[116:18.26]So, during the first three rooms, so the surgery room, the carousel room, and the electric zap key room,
[116:29.32]I didn't have any direction in my ear.
[116:32.78]So if you're wondering why I didn't pick the right person on the carousel, it's because I did not know who it was because I didn't have it in my ear because it was a technical problem.
[116:48.19]So for the first three rooms, I was just like, oh, oh, fuck.
[116:52.77]I need to pay close attention to everything going on because I have no direction in my ear.
[117:03.23]So it was, there was an internal moment as we were starting that third kind of carousel scene where I was just going, alright, man, this is a good luck because I don't know what's really going on.
[117:17.66]I kind of just went in there and it was like, alright, I'm just going to have fun.
[117:23.86]And that's exactly what it was.
[117:26.28]It was such a fun time to just put on that, those prosthetics.
[117:33.91]I loved that.
[117:34.71]I loved every second of doing that.
[117:39.07]I think I even said to Ranboo, I was like, oh man, imagine, imagine we had like three more rooms to do.
[117:44.11]I feel like we were just, you know, we were just getting right into it.
[117:50.12]Yeah, there's a point where Slimesicle, because I think Slimesicle had direction in his ear.
[117:56.26]And there's a point where he's just like...
[117:58.15]Hey, uh, so, I mean, if I was somebody picking, I think I would probably, you know, I may have, you know, maybe pick, uh, pick her.
[118:06.18]And I was like, oh, what are you, yeah, that's really you?
[118:09.90]Is that what you, is that what you think?
[118:11.54]Okay, alright.
[118:14.20]You.
[118:14.46]Oh, yeah, I...
[118:20.99]Slimesicle saved my ass so bad.
[118:24.05]I had absolutely no idea who got the audience poll.
[118:27.77]So I'm just sitting there going, oh, okay, if you go back and watch it, I just start stalling.
[118:34.75]I start stalling for time because I just start doing Duck, Duck, Goose.
[118:39.53]That is the moment in the show when you can know somebody got picked and I have no fucking idea who it is.
[118:46.32]I have not a single solitary clue.
[118:49.62]So Duck, uh...
[118:51.46]I don't fucking know how I'm going to get through this one.
[118:55.28]I don't know.
[118:56.52]I guess I was going to be like a weirdo with this prosthetics on and let me walk around in a circle.
[119:05.69]Okay, I got this one.
[119:06.55]I know how to do it.
[119:11.13]We can put these back.
[119:16.60]And that was Valkyrae and Sykkuno with the rats.
[119:22.15]They were a lot of fun to work with.
[119:24.23]Valkyrae was super into that.
[119:26.45]It was awesome.
[119:38.47]Yeah.
[119:40.25]Super, super nice.
[119:43.11]They were really, really cool.
[119:44.17]Just kind of hanging out and talking about random stuff.
[119:46.75]Alright.
[119:47.89]How are the rats going to act?
[119:49.77]Let's see.
[119:56.70]That's it.
[119:57.10]That's it.
[119:57.41]That's it.
[119:57.71]That's it.
[119:57.97]That's it right there.
[119:58.97]Now, come on, come on, come on, come on.
[120:12.70]This is a hook scenario, right?
[120:27.99]What are your children's names?
[120:29.17]Yeah.
[120:32.35]Just walking up to Austin, just like, you know, fluffing up his shirt a little.
[120:36.25]Come here, you.
[120:36.95]Let me, come here.
[120:38.71]What are your children's names?
[120:40.62]It's just like, oh, fuck.
[120:42.36]Uh-oh.
[120:45.34]He is so goddamn fucking funny, by the way.
[120:51.34]I love working with Austin.
[120:52.98]He is so fucking funny.
[121:02.30]Maybe I could just grab this one too.
[121:03.56]Let me try the grab.
[121:08.82]You know what I'm saying?
[121:09.50]The grab worked pretty well on the other one.
[121:11.00]Why wouldn't it work well on this one?
[121:19.24]Alright, we're getting somewhere.
[121:26.33]What about your runway walk?
[121:28.21]Yeah.
[121:29.35]I've seen that pop up here and there.
[121:36.76]I love that cartoon villain shit.
[121:39.58]You know, going into the candy room, like that Willy Wonka inspired room, being like, oh, hey, can you hold this for a second?
[121:45.41]Oh, the detonator and, you know, all the things that you could get out with.
[121:51.42]I love the Looney Tunes bullshit.
[121:53.48]It just does it for me so much.
[122:06.80]Is this going to do it?
[122:08.10]It needs to be really, really heavy.
[122:17.87]Come on.
[122:19.21]Shit.
[122:26.31]Were the walls flavored?
[122:27.73]I don't think so.
[122:31.05]The goal with that room was to show people.
[122:35.03]Like, you do other shit here.
[122:37.94]It's... What are you... Why?
[122:40.38]What?
[122:43.28]There was a bit that didn't get used that I really wanted to do, but I guess there was just not enough time or not enough space or whatever.
[122:50.45]So here's what I wanted to have happen.
[122:52.17]It was close to happening, but it just kind of didn't work.
[122:57.34]When we were initially doing concept stuff, I thought it would have been funny if...
[123:02.28]So one of the rooms seems to go room to room to room.
[123:04.14]Okay, we're in this room.
[123:05.20]Okay, I made it out of this one.
[123:06.16]I'm on the next room.
[123:07.64]So take the party through the new room and they open the door.
[123:10.20]Okay, what's the next one?
[123:11.22]What's the next weird saw-inspired crazy puzzler weird room, right?
[123:16.30]And it's just a living room.
[123:18.09]It's just a regular living room with nothing weird.
[123:21.45]And I just say, well, I run an Airbnb out of here sometimes too.
[123:25.45]And actually they're going to be here in about 20 minutes.
[123:27.43]So just, there's nothing in here, actually.
[123:28.97]Just go to the next one.
[123:30.69]And they just walk through it.
[123:32.77]And it's a nice, normal room.
[123:37.75]But all that to just do one, like, 15 to 20 second routine?
[123:45.13]Yeah, I get it.
[123:45.83]What do you think, we need to fulcrum?
[123:58.89]Or the other thing was it kind of started growing from there was what if there was just a family in the room?
[124:06.11]Like on vacation and show people like getting towels and like, oh, we're going to the beach really soon here.
[124:12.33]Oh, we're like as if we're getting ready to like at the hotel.
[124:31.27]What is the cheesecake shit about?
[124:32.97]You want to know what the cheesecake shit is about?
[124:38.44]What do you want me to tell you?
[124:39.84]Has Ranboo talked about the cheesecake shit?
[124:43.34]Has anybody talked about the cheesecake thing?
[124:46.04]Because it was literally not for anybody.
[124:49.15]But for five people that were at dinner the night before.
[124:53.73]Okay, so they did.
[124:54.57]People have.
[125:00.42]Okay, so let me... For those that have not heard the story, and I'm just going to do it really quickly, because you may have heard it like three or four times already.
[125:06.38]So... And I'm not going to play the game, so just relax.
[125:10.84]So at dinner, there was a big dinner where there was, you know, cast and crew, and we all kind of just went to dinner at this nice restaurant, right?
[125:20.11]And one of the desserts was cheesecake.
[125:22.99]So one of the producers, and they, we had a lot of people at this table.
[125:27.43]So there had to have been at least, at least 15 plus people at this dinner.
[125:34.29]So at the end, we got this big package where, okay, we have to feed all these people.
[125:38.94]We're doing a big group thing.
[125:40.30]We got a bunch of desserts and it was probably like, I mean, 15, 20 people sharing desserts.
[125:45.40]You have a bunch of different desserts.
[125:47.12]You've got like, I think we had like eight to 10 cheesecake slices.
[125:52.35]There was just cheesecake everywhere.
[125:55.05]And one of the producers kind of just looks over.
[125:56.93]We took a few bites.
[125:58.09]Oh, this is so good.
[125:59.10]Wow, it's so delicious.
[126:01.04]And he kind of just looks over and he goes, wow, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake.
[126:06.88]And we were all like, what the fuck was that?
[126:10.73]He's like, man, it's a bad day to be a cheesecake, isn't it?
[126:14.83]And the whole kind of table is just like...
[126:20.11]It was like funny, but at the same time it was like... Alright, yeah, that's like kind of- Yeah, because it is kind of a bad day to be a cheesecake.
[126:27.13]Like, we're eating a fucking lot of them right now.
[126:30.45]And, um... Nikki, who was sitting on the other side of the table... She was laughing her ass off at this.
[126:43.17]Just laughing her ass off.
[126:44.29]And we kept saying it and kept kind of going over it.
[126:47.27]And at the table...
[126:49.93]We were kind of sitting around going, alright, we know we're going to be on camera tomorrow.
[126:57.08]I'm going to do everything I can to try to make as many people break on camera as possible.
[127:01.86]I'm going to say that tomorrow.
[127:03.22]I'm going to find a way to say this.
[127:06.81]And people like, dude, please don't do that.
[127:09.35]You're going to fuck up the whole show.
[127:10.61]You're going to ruin the whole show because everyone's going to start laughing.
[127:13.83]And it's that it's don't do that.
[127:15.55]Like, should you do that?
[127:17.96]So I just like waiting for the opportunity to be like, oh, so, you know, that in joke that everybody's like, don't be careful.
[127:26.32]Oh, I had pasta today.
[127:28.44]And that's how I told him I knew it was coming.
[127:30.18]The people knew it was coming.
[127:31.22]The five or six, like seven people at that table knew it was coming when I started talking about what I ate.
[127:37.97]So I'm like, oh, yeah, that imposter guy felt pretty bloated after that.
[127:41.78]But for dessert, oh, let me just tell you, it was a bad day to be a cheesecake, alright?
[127:53.11]Yeah, and that's the fucking story.
[128:00.38]The goal was to try to make somebody just desperately fight with trying not to laugh and fuck up that scene.
[128:15.04]It was just like a good time.
[128:16.19]Okay, you know what?
[128:18.53]Whenever you do an event or a show or something, this is how I really believe and how I really feel.
[128:23.75]No like jokes or fucking around or anything right now.
[128:26.65]If people are having a good time,
[128:30.38]then I feel like everything is better the whole show from cast and crew everyone's like actually having a great time people like laughing people are really into it people have just you know this is a fun time that we're all enjoying together that's the most important thing didn't you look directly at nikki as well yeah yeah I was going I was like okay I'm I know you're you're probably going to laugh you're probably going to break
[128:58.91]Um, I don't know.
[129:00.21]I don't think I can do this one.
[129:04.59]What's this one?
[129:09.55]Make the robot sit on the chair.
[129:11.19]Wait, what?
[129:23.58]Can it be my chair?
[129:42.13]How do I move this fast enough for... Hold on.
[129:51.37]Should I push his legs?
[130:05.59]That's not going to work.
[130:16.00]How do I make something happen here?
[130:24.18]I need a fulcrum?
[130:26.62]Big triangle.
[130:28.62]You mean for him to sit on and get, like, launched?
[130:31.30]No.
[130:34.50]I'm not going to care about this right now.
[130:36.26]I'm just going to try to figure out how to move this well.
[130:38.24]Okay, I have a bunch of time.
[130:48.27]I wish I could.
[130:48.91]There we go.
[130:50.12]It's gotta be much faster than that.
[130:53.54]How am I going to make that faster?
[130:54.68]OK, hold on.
[131:12.28]Wait, wait, wait.
[131:16.74]This is hard.
[131:24.60]Can I just like box him in for a second?
[131:26.40]Okay.
[131:50.11]Upside down triangle behind the chair and then push it forward.
[132:00.48]Yeah, but I'm upside down, but I feel I want to try the right way.
[132:12.50]How do you do this fast enough before he sits down?
[132:15.02]That's close.
[132:33.18]Go!
[132:45.91]It's not heavy enough.
[132:46.53]It's not heavy enough.
[133:17.69]This is very, very hard.
[133:21.07]Wider, wider.
[133:21.95]I can't go much wider.
[133:24.07]Otherwise it'll just hit the top and not do anything.
[133:30.42]It's close.
[133:33.68]Can I like weigh it down?
[133:47.19]I think this is still possible from here.
[133:51.34]No?
[134:15.89]Block the guy's ass?
[134:16.97]I thought I tried last time, but he kind of just... Hmm.
[134:33.56]Yeah, he weighs too much.
[134:36.76]Okay.
[134:37.78]That doesn't help.
[134:42.91]Jeremy, you need to move the chair to the guy.
[134:46.21]No, I don't.
[134:48.71]What are you talking about?
[134:53.57]I can't make anything weigh fast.
[134:55.36]Nothing can weigh enough before he's sitting down.
[134:58.54]See what I mean?
[134:59.18]I could make it heavier.
[135:03.54]But you have to do it instantly.
[135:18.90]Like, can I, like, just box him in for now?
[135:21.18]I can't.
[135:23.97]Unless it's... What the hell did that do?
[135:50.80]I wonder if I can... No, you can't just slide back.
[135:53.88]I don't get it.
[135:56.38]Like, the sumo wrestler touched the ground?
[136:08.19]You had it?
[136:09.43]It's a pain in the ass.
[136:10.25]I don't want to do it.
[136:12.14]I don't like time limits like that.
[136:13.42]Let me just do it.
[136:14.00]I don't want a time limit.
[136:15.40]I don't want a one second time limit.
[136:17.40]I want to be able to do it at my own pace.
[136:19.46]I don't want a one and a half second time limit.
[136:36.39]Oh, this is gonna be fucking hell.
[136:38.49]Okay.
[136:39.83]So, I kinda need to just go like this?
[136:43.77]But it needs to weigh... Well, actually, this won't be that bad.
[136:45.80]Just make it really heavy.
[136:52.22]Gotta touch the ground, though.
[136:53.62]So, that actually might... Hold on.
[137:04.99]Close.
[137:35.24]Nice turd.
[137:36.20]Okay.
[137:41.89]It's not heavy enough.
[138:10.65]Oh, it's the ground!
[138:47.60]This weighs a million pounds.
[138:55.81]You're saying make a big M?
[138:56.69]Or a big W?
[138:59.07]What do you mean, like... How would a W work?
[139:19.47]Weigh it down, then draw more above it.
[139:21.13]Let's go with the... Alright, we're gonna go with the claw technique.
[139:27.92]Hook technique is good.
[139:29.08]Keeps... Steady.
[139:30.42]This thing just needs to weigh a shitload.
[139:49.01]Okay.
[140:03.84]We're just gonna squish.
[140:04.76]Do you know what I mean?
[140:21.42]Just weigh this whole thing down.
[140:27.39]If this doesn't work, I don't know what I have to do.
[140:31.37]Get it to be perfect.
[140:51.84]Alright, you ready?
[140:52.46]Let's let it go.
[140:57.88]I didn't know this was part of the universe.
[141:00.80]The hand is part of the universe.
[141:03.32]Right.
[141:11.26]Shit.
[141:11.42]It's okay.
[141:18.11]Make sure it doesn't grab, because it'll hook on.
[141:27.48]I like this music.
[141:28.36]What is it?
[141:28.68]Is it still Club Penguin?
[141:29.90]It's good.
[141:32.06]I like it.
[141:49.22]I should put on... I want to put on Smash Bros.
[141:51.00]music.
[141:51.24]You know the one that goes...
[141:56.65]It's actually getting stuck on the... Shit.
[142:07.75]This is actually the way to do it too.
[142:09.31]I just keep having to get caught on stuff.
[142:11.25]Like an idiot.
[142:12.49]Like an idiot.
[142:37.42]Don't go too close to the edge, because it'll get stuck.
[142:48.17]How do I... Nothing is heavy enough.
[142:57.36]Nothing's heavy enough.
[143:13.14]It needs velocity.
[143:14.10]Put it up higher.
[143:14.82]I can't.
[143:17.44]There's a hand in the way.
[143:24.61]I cannot do anything here.
[143:26.61]So the highest I can drop this from is right here.
[143:37.11]Go from the ground up?
[143:39.22]How does that work?
[144:08.06]That's kind of close.
[144:28.13]I mean I could I could sit here and grab this all day, but that's just not gonna happen That's what I wanted to do in the beginning
[145:06.73]Alright, alright, hold on, hold on.
[145:11.49]That kind of was doing it.
[145:22.62]Come on, do it.
[145:36.81]Is there a refund timer going?
[145:38.09]I'm way past that.
[145:38.87]Alright, let me think if I were to... It needs to go boom, boom.
[145:47.78]So, I mean... Once you start drawing, it just drops.
[145:54.25]So, I wish I could freeze stuff.
[145:56.13]I wish I could hold something here, but I can't.
[145:58.87]So, it has to be... When you start a drawing, you gotta go from the ground up.
[146:07.03]So, like, what if I do this?
[146:08.55]Like, just block it so it can only go to this area here.
[146:11.03]And then just knock it somehow.
[146:16.45]And what if I just drop a... What if I just drop this on here?
[146:18.71]Like, just go boink.
[146:21.19]Not gonna help.
[146:23.71]Eh.
[146:29.95]We can't hear the music?
[146:30.99]Yeah, you can.
[146:31.33]It's right there.
[146:39.87]I mean, I just don't... I... I don't know.
[146:46.62]There's no dodge roll in this game.
[146:47.78]I can't play it.
[146:50.28]Um... What is this?
[147:02.65]Make the balloon touch the left wall.
[147:17.56]I think that's what they want me to do.
[147:18.57]Maybe just little bits?
[147:30.35]There we go.
[147:32.06]I hate this game and I'm not even playing it.
[147:34.44]No, we're fine.
[147:38.26]Make the balls touch the red areas.
[147:39.88]Do these have to spin?
[147:42.24]Let's just see what happens if I go right in the middle.
[147:49.11]Well, that's how you get it done.
[147:52.80]Give the girl the balloon.
[148:00.58]Oh, you mean a crusher with a rock?
[148:03.74]Oops.
[148:06.92]Uh, can I?
[148:13.66]I can't put anything in here.
[148:15.93]Oh, I can.
[148:19.63]Ohhhh.
[148:48.14]I did it!
[148:53.74]What's going on?
[148:54.36]Pick up the balloon!
[148:55.48]What's happening?
[148:56.01]What is going on?
[149:01.83]What?
[149:07.21]What the hell was that?
[149:23.38]Why won't you stay?
[149:25.27]Stay!
[149:56.21]There we go!
[149:56.91]Alright.
[149:59.19]Make the ball touch both red areas.
[150:01.58]Ex-excuse me?
[150:03.00]Somebody said lower the game volume?
[150:08.08]Is it allowed?
[150:19.01]Make the ball touch both re-excuse me?
[151:03.33]Looks like it's time for a fulcrum.
[151:06.69]That's right.
[151:08.69]Good call.
[151:24.22]I'm fine.
[151:37.08]trouble.
[151:37.98]I'm in trouble.
[151:39.56]How do I get this to bounce?
[151:48.19]There it is.
[151:48.51]See that quick thinking right there?
[151:55.04]Make the balloons fly away.
[152:10.25]Just wait, probably, right?
[152:11.07]I imagine it's probably something like that.
[152:17.62]Yeah, there it goes.
[152:21.78]We're good.
[152:23.72]This game is addicting.
[152:26.86]Release the balloon.
[152:27.60]Done.
[152:43.67]Make the red ball touch the left wall.
[153:06.46]Why does it keep saying red?
[153:13.96]Nice fulcrum, bro.
[153:16.02]I got it.
[153:16.30]Okay.
[153:19.16]Pull the bottle cap out.
[153:20.54]Easy.
[153:22.86]I got this one done.
[153:23.68]This one's completely cached.
[153:25.16]I didn't know the bottle was gonna fall.
[153:33.46]I... Wait.
[153:51.37]This guy's brain.
[153:52.31]Someone's trying to beat you in a race of the game.
[153:59.79]I'm not racing anybody.
[154:01.23]I'm playing casually on my own time.
[154:05.33]This does not say, hey, I'm racing right now.
[154:12.17]Red ball.
[154:12.73]Okay.
[154:15.09]An idea with this one.
[154:40.07]Have your 30s been better than your 20s?
[154:43.55]Um... That's a good question because I feel like in your 20s, you're kind of figuring out who you are.
[154:53.00]And in your 30s, you kind of know who that is.
[154:56.06]I got an idea here.
[154:57.82]Hold on.
[155:00.80]So... Watch this.
[155:02.30]Ready?
[155:03.04]This is gonna be like a fucking golf club.
[155:06.97]That's the right idea.
[155:07.71]Hold on.
[155:16.29]That was dumb.
[155:21.02]I think the rock has to be bigger.
[155:22.66]And then this has to go all the way.
[155:24.06]And then that.
[155:39.91]That's it right there.
[155:41.45]Keep pulling it.
[155:57.94]close yeah I mean I honestly I feel like since I turned say like 35 or so you can't I kind of just know exactly what I'm what I want to do and who that person is and who I am in your 20s you're really kind of still figuring out like hey what exactly am I doing with myself
[156:24.51]I've said this before, it's not a race.
[156:26.37]So I know a lot of people in this channel are in their 20s.
[156:32.29]It's not a race.
[156:33.15]Don't think it is.
[156:36.12]I didn't figure out shit until I was well into my late 20s, early 30s.
[156:40.46]And still, I'm still figuring.
[156:41.66]I mean, look, I don't know how to do the fucking Thagorean theorem here.
[156:57.73]That's it right there.
[157:00.35]This needs to be so much heavier.
[157:01.33]Yeah.
[157:15.09]Maybe it's too heavy.
[157:16.45]Maybe this needs to be heavier.
[157:19.59]Wait a minute.
[157:20.23]Hold on.
[157:25.87]Watch this.
[157:30.29]Now, theoretically... I don't have a theory at all.
[157:59.12]Shit!
[158:00.44]Shit!
[158:04.52]It's right there.
[158:12.48]God damn it.
[158:21.77]Do it already!
[158:38.87]Alright, that pulls it.
[158:41.07]I think I got it.
[158:42.37]I think that's the one.
[158:43.05]I remember what that looks like.
[158:49.31]Go like this up.
[158:50.89]Right here.
[158:55.41]And then that here.
[158:58.29]And then boot it.
[159:00.87]I think that's it.
[159:03.21]That's too long, but it's the right idea.
[159:16.95]Shit, still too long.
[159:17.93]I have a big exam next week.
[159:26.52]Wish me luck.
[159:27.18]I studied.
[159:28.20]Good luck.
[159:32.17]I've learned since the last time.
[159:35.65]Somebody said, little bro can't just say good luck to somebody.
[159:39.07]He has to go on a 15 minute rant about like pot pies and stuff.
[159:43.33]I heard it.
[159:44.65]So I'm doing it differently now.
[159:57.14]Fuck, it needs to be like a bend.
[159:58.46]I don't know anything about this.
[160:02.71]We all do different things.
[160:04.17]Okay.
[160:04.87]If you're like, Oh, I know how to do this and do that.
[160:07.61]That's good.
[160:08.25]I'm glad you know how to do it.
[160:13.80]I'm a tinkerer.
[160:15.26]There's a difference.
[160:33.09]You want the thing to fall to the right, but keep building it up against the right wall.
[160:36.75]Dude, I know.
[160:37.71]I'm just at the zoo right now.
[160:46.72]I need to bend it?
[160:47.86]I don't know.
[160:50.36]Move the ball first?
[160:53.46]I guess I could move the ball first.
[161:09.79]Oh my god!
[161:10.25]No, stop!
[162:18.02]Finished Breath of the Wild.
[162:18.86]You suck at this game.
[162:19.68]You just added three more weeks to when I'm going to play Breath of the Wild.
[163:01.20]Remember that.
[163:01.66]I need to remember this exact thing that I just did.
[163:12.75]I already forgot it.
[163:13.31]I forgot it already.
[163:19.19]I wasn't even paying attention.
[163:38.01]Object permanence.
[163:41.47]I'm just not burning anything into short term memory.
[163:43.97]Because I'm about to put a hole through my monitor.
[163:48.51]It's really hard before, you know, before you like, you know, put your head above the monitor.
[163:52.86]It's hard to be like, oh, yeah, I like just like pay attention more.
[164:07.57]How did you ever headbutt a monitor?
[164:14.53]I can't believe I'm up against... I'm up against... Oh, what's the character from League of Legends?
[164:19.88]I can't even name one.
[164:27.24]Rise?
[164:28.10]What's his name?
[164:30.15]Oh, shit.
[164:32.85]What's the character's name?
[164:39.39]Oh, yeah, it is rise.
[164:40.65]Oh, fuck.
[164:41.01]I'm going against rise mid.
[164:43.09]Fuck, dude.
[164:43.83]It's over.
[164:44.35]I'm gonna lose.
[164:45.95]I don't know the music.
[165:14.43]Alright.
[165:14.75]First of all, do this first.
[165:20.12]I had it.
[165:21.84]Then it's like here and then like dip.
[165:25.20]And then I did this.
[165:26.34]I think that's what I did.
[165:31.55]Did I not do it like that?
[165:34.59]That was a career ending joke.
[165:36.67]I've done like a thousand of those.
[165:38.69]So I don't think so.
[165:54.59]I wish I could draw more than once and not have everything just start to move when I'm done painting.
[165:59.40]I wish there was a button I could press that was like, okay, start the physics now.
[166:16.17]I don't care.
[166:19.72]You can't have everything.
[166:24.43]Have your brother Dave do it for you?
[166:26.66]I would bet that half of you guys wouldn't be able to do even a third of the ones that I'm doing.
[166:32.46]Do you think that's correct?
[166:33.98]I would bet that.
[166:35.20]I bet a third of the people here probably couldn't do even half of these.
[166:46.65]What do you think?
[166:47.61]A third?
[166:48.01]Do you think 30% of 20,000 people?
[166:49.91]Probably a few thousand, right?
[166:54.32]And who cares?
[166:54.75]Alright, let's release.
[166:57.93]I got an idea already.
[167:08.12]You know what's going.
[167:14.93]He's free.
[167:23.12]Okay, let's put on pizza.
[167:26.72]Pizza.
[167:31.74]Pizza Tower.
[167:33.30]Why not?
[167:37.03]Hook the balloon on the dot.
[167:41.61]Hmm.
[167:44.49]Well, how the heck do I do that?
[167:47.59]Oh.
[167:52.57]This is a great soundtrack.
[167:59.29]Yeah, there it is.
[168:05.06]Turn it up.
[168:06.32]It can be kind of low.
[168:07.36]It doesn't have to be super loud.
[168:08.54]What the hell is that?
[168:12.70]I lost everything.
[168:13.42]I lost my chat.
[168:21.35]There we go.
[168:23.99]Does anybody know how to turn off that feature of windows?
[168:26.31]Which I don't, I don't understand why it was ever implemented.
[168:31.87]You ever have like, I've got like eight windows open and then like I, for some reason clicked and dragged and moved to a spot on one of the monitors that just minimizes every fucking single window.
[168:45.40]What, what were they doing when they made that a thing?
[168:50.62]Oh, hey, I'm just moving one of my windows maybe a little too close to the top.
[168:55.08]Just minimize every single window you were working on.
[169:04.94]Oh, this is a good idea.
[169:38.71]I didn't want to let go.
[169:39.63]Whoops, I skirted up.
[169:45.49]I want to freeze it here.
[169:50.37]Because when I let go, everything falls.
[169:52.13]Actually, this is probably the way to do it.
[170:15.10]No, I have to turn it on first.
[170:30.49]Why would you get stuck here, of all places?
[170:32.29]You were just moving up the line.
[170:34.66]What stopped you?
[171:02.91]Oh, I thought, okay.
[171:13.55]It has to stay on there.
[171:14.55]Oh, this is going to be fucking hard.
[171:16.89]This actually will be very difficult.
[171:23.70]Oh, man.
[171:26.06]Okay.
[171:26.60]How tall is this?
[171:42.40]That doesn't fly away.
[171:43.30]Okay.
[171:52.66]Can I do anything now that I did this?
[171:57.38]The hook has collision.
[171:58.46]I mean, the goal now is I'm trying to... Like that.
[172:11.07]Oh, do it already.
[172:28.70]It's too low.
[172:29.48]I think it should get it.
[172:49.10]Right there.
[172:49.66]Latch.
[172:50.84]Latch.
[172:54.82]No, it's too low.
[172:55.88]You're right.
[172:56.50]Damn it.
[172:56.82]Okay.
[173:04.95]Alright, we're good.
[173:06.83]Now I gotta figure out how to just knock it this way.
[173:23.12]You fucking idiot.
[173:25.75]You idiot.
[173:27.21]You idiot.
[173:43.57]I've uninstalled games that are less than this.
[173:45.23]I just wanted to let you know.
[173:46.39]It's in the right spot.
[174:02.52]Should I just, like, make a... Like... Just go like this?
[174:06.06]And, like, drag it this way?
[174:07.36]No.
[174:12.28]Wait.
[174:12.74]It's going, it's going.
[174:33.70]It's right here.
[174:36.48]Come on.
[174:42.49]Oh my god.
[174:44.57]You fucking asshole.
[174:46.55]Get on there.
[174:47.63]Dude, look, there is plenty of space.
[174:57.10]This is absolute bullshit.
[174:59.04]Why can I not draw here?
[175:00.82]It's fucking me up big time.
[175:14.59]I'm gonna get this.
[175:17.73]It's so close.
[175:18.45]It's right here.
[175:29.49]This hurts to watch.
[175:30.41]This hurts to play.
[175:32.21]Just in case you're wondering.
[175:42.39]Shit!
[175:55.43]No, I want it to stay there.
[175:56.63]Actually, it might work out.
[176:00.79]You can solve this with one line.
[176:04.05]You're talking about like, do this, you have to activate it and then go like this so it floats over and gets hooked on it.
[176:11.00]But the problem is the balloon doesn't want to move anymore.
[176:16.44]Do a ramp with a hook.
[176:20.62]Have it go through the string.
[176:25.83]I mean like this.
[176:29.98]So we'll drag it up?
[176:31.62]No.
[176:35.60]Ster beat every level.
[176:36.50]You're going to let him win.
[176:37.42]Ster did not beat 1,200 levels.
[176:41.15]Ster probably played this for 20 minutes and then just left and moved on.
[176:58.73]I'm going to duck.
[176:59.87]It's all that matters.
[177:00.69]I don't care.
[177:34.73]Oh, that moves.
[177:35.37]Okay, hold on.
[177:39.73]I quit.
[177:40.59]I'm taking the IQ test instead.
[177:53.80]Is the mouse to draw shapes?
[177:55.62]Click on the... Oh, no.
[178:02.65]Don't judge me based on what you're about to see, because it's not fair.
[178:08.97]It's actually completely, it's gonna be completely unfair.
[178:15.94]Okay, click on the IQ icon for a comprehensive diagnosis.
[178:22.68]It is recommended that as many of the 20 tasks be completed as possible.
[178:26.87]Okay.
[178:28.73]Alright, put your drawing into the beaker.
[178:30.59]You cannot draw in the blue area.
[178:36.65]okay so we're gonna make a we're gonna make like a bridge
[179:05.73]Oh, I was trying to... Can I restart it?
[179:07.86]Because I was trying... I was trying to make it... This is why I want... I wish I could just fucking... You see what I was trying to do here?
[179:21.33]That's what I was trying to do.
[179:22.31]But it fucked up.
[179:33.20]Get in there.
[179:34.76]Alright, there it is.
[179:36.32]This should have been two tries.
[179:37.72]Okay.
[179:43.26]Make the red ball touch the red area.
[179:47.58]Let me think about this for a second before everybody screams.
[179:53.63]You got an 80.
[179:54.27]That's 80 IQ.
[179:56.69]No, no.
[179:59.35]We have to wait for the assessment.
[180:01.23]By the way, you're taking time away from my IQ test.
[180:05.90]I need to touch the red area.
[180:08.74]Okay.
[180:12.39]I thought this thing was just saying I was an idiot.
[180:19.41]Alright.
[180:20.17]So, let's think about it.
[180:22.71]I'm going to have to knock this forward.
[180:26.47]It is not to go in here.
[180:27.99]It's to go here.
[180:30.19]So, let's start by going like this.
[180:36.00]It's got to be steep enough where it can make it.
[180:42.62]Like that.
[180:43.30]Okay.
[180:47.85]I also need to go... I need a ramp here.
[180:51.29]So it goes... Uh-oh.
[181:06.14]I think that should do it.
[181:23.43]You know what I was going for.
[181:24.97]Is my IQ bad because drawing with a mouse sucks?
[181:30.05]No, that's not intelligence.
[181:31.71]Drawing with a mouse sucks.
[181:45.20]You might get there.
[181:49.52]You've had practice, though.
[181:51.32]Two hours of practice?
[181:53.12]You need to do 10,000 hours of something to be fucking good at it.
[181:56.51]I'm not even close to being there.
[181:59.63]There we go.
[182:18.11]How is that better than the first one?
[182:21.75]Draw something and touch the red area.
[182:27.56]Okay.
[182:32.54]So it's going to drop over here.
[182:34.66]So it's going to make like a little tower, right?
[182:58.38]There we go.
[183:00.60]What was that?
[183:01.52]130 IQ.
[183:02.07]What's yours?
[183:04.51]Make the red square touch the left wall.
[183:33.48]Come on.
[183:54.74]I didn't mean to do that.
[183:55.64]I... How do I...
[184:52.80]That's what the fulcrum was.
[184:53.62]I would have had it.
[184:56.90]This one, I'm going to get like two IQ on this one.
[184:59.00]I didn't, why did I even make that thing?
[185:21.60]Fucking smash this thing.
[185:37.75]Push it all the way?
[185:39.05]Come on!
[185:47.20]What did I get?
[185:48.14]That's fine.
[185:51.31]I'm not doing my IQ assessment yet.
[186:11.58]Go already.
[186:12.60]I did this one first try before.
[186:14.58]Shit.
[186:33.81]130.
[186:35.62]Red ball, touch the red area.
[186:37.20]Watch this.
[186:37.70]First try.
[186:43.62]I forgot that it doesn't stay.
[186:47.50]That's my fault for not remembering.
[186:52.52]I think I still might be alright.
[187:18.85]Play Street Fighter.
[187:19.69]Um, no.
[187:30.34]I fucked it up.
[187:36.80]That's too big.
[187:55.12]That's gotta be it.
[187:57.58]Hey.
[187:57.82]110 IQ.
[188:01.28]Get out of here.
[188:02.78]Draw something and touch the red area.
[188:12.83]Oh, I see what's going on here.
[188:18.13]Uh, I don't...
[188:27.23]Got it.
[188:29.67]Oh, not like this.
[188:30.81]What do you think I was doing?
[188:32.05]I made the tea specifically for that.
[188:35.57]Have only one snowflake in the container.
[188:38.70]I didn't know that's what I... Whoa.
[188:41.74]I think I just got it.
[188:42.58]Oh, come on.
[188:45.98]Get over there.
[188:49.16]Oh, 170 IQ.
[188:55.51]Lower the coat hanger.
[188:59.51]Free try.
[189:35.42]Where are the fulcrums?
[189:36.44]I don't need them right now.
[189:37.82]I'm fine as we are.
[189:41.64]Lower the coat hanger.
[189:43.06]I need it to spin this way.
[189:44.66]I got an idea.
[190:02.93]Really?
[190:03.19]The momentum is not going to work?
[190:44.64]I think I hate him.
[190:47.87]You wouldn't do this in the... You would not do this in the amount of time I'm doing it.
[190:51.17]You wouldn't do this.
[190:52.41]You wouldn't do this in the same amount of time.
[190:54.86]You wouldn't do it.
[190:56.48]You wouldn't be able to do it in the same amount of time.
[190:58.78]You wouldn't do it.
[190:59.96]You wouldn't be able to do it.
[191:39.35]Get off.
[191:40.71]Come on, dude.
[191:42.01]Are you kidding me?
[191:46.39]There are engineers and architects in chat.
[191:58.17]Unlatch it.
[192:00.72]That's technically unlatched.
[192:02.82]There it is.
[192:06.62]There actually might be.
[192:08.20]That was 130.
[192:08.44]That one was a hard one.
[192:11.04]The yellow ball will start moving when something touches it.
[192:12.92]Put the balls in the cup.
[192:13.76]It's salvageable.
[192:55.13]Got it.
[193:23.91]my god what the fuck are you trolling dude I don't do you really think I would be able to do that if I tried if I really tried you think I would be able to put pixel perfect capture that ball where it was
[194:03.88]Stop trolling, dude.
[194:04.90]I'm not joking.
[194:09.60]Just two lines, dude.
[194:10.60]I'm begging you.
[194:11.56]I got it right here.
[194:13.85]See, I didn't know.
[194:14.67]Okay, I didn't know they had collision.
[194:16.91]I thought that they could go through each other.
[194:20.65]I did it.
[194:21.27]And that one was 100 IQ.
[194:22.95]So, I'll take the complaints.
[194:25.92]Throw Alex up 10 meters.
[194:27.42]I know how to do that.
[194:30.10]I did it accidentally like five times already.
[194:53.06]I guess that's 25 meters.
[194:55.08]That's not even... 20 IQ?
[194:58.28]What?
[195:03.37]How is it... That's a worse one so far?
[195:15.20]Take the ball out.
[195:16.04]Alright.
[195:36.33]Play new music playing right now.
[195:38.69]You can definitely hear it.
[195:46.26]I'm almost done with my IQ test.
[195:52.40]This will be it right here.
[195:58.06]Here it is. 120.
[196:04.48]Almost done.
[196:05.06]Don't let the cup touch the ground.
[196:08.07]What cup?
[196:09.39]Don't let the cup touch the ground?
[196:42.72]Hmm.
[197:11.16]Uh oh.
[197:12.76]I have to turn this up.
[197:15.64]Okay.
[199:08.56]This sounded like fucking Sylvester.
[199:23.20]Oh, that's a suffering Succotash.
[199:28.26]That sweetie bird bit me on the fucking finger.
[200:00.22]Let's go!
[200:00.74]Come on.
[200:09.94]Does that work?
[200:48.87]There it is.
[200:52.85]Make the beaker touch the red area.
[200:55.01]Okay.
[201:05.15]You know what we're doing.
[201:06.99]You know what we're doing.
[201:09.20]You ready?
[201:21.51]Shit!
[201:41.25]I just hear Holly fucking laughing.
[201:43.39]It's like...
[201:54.47]Dude, your fulcrum sucks.
[201:55.73]Hey, leave my fulcrum alone.
[201:57.69]There we go.
[202:11.90]This is it.
[202:46.17]Oh, come on, really?
[203:01.92]Oh!
[203:02.08]40. 40.
[203:31.12]This thing is heavy!
[204:05.33]Bang.
[204:06.31]Got it.
[204:09.09]Place the ball on the other side of the... Okay.
[204:12.14]Check this out.
[204:14.09]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[206:03.91]I have to like whack it over there.
[206:24.76]You have the most interesting mind in the world.
[206:30.46]I have to whack it through here.
[206:31.64]I need to fucking fulcrum already.
[206:36.41]Don't tell me when I do and do not need to fulcrum.
[206:42.41]Hey, this is a conversation between A and B you're talking.
[206:45.83]C is the next letter in fucking get out of here.
[206:48.84]You know what I'm saying?
[207:09.55]Winning, apparently.
[207:10.27]Why do I keep winning?
[207:19.52]Okay.
[207:47.45]I don't know what I'm doing.
[207:48.01]I don't know what I'm doing this for.
[207:51.43]I was trying to make a ceiling to fuck.
[207:55.25]I don't know why I made this.
[208:04.30]Shit.
[208:09.42]A ceiling for what?
[208:10.10]So it didn't launch?
[208:10.96]I don't know.
[208:11.62]Do I guide it?
[208:14.64]You literally had the idea, the right idea, but the wrong side.
[208:17.53]I get a good fall from here.
[208:48.37]Why do you keep doing that?
[208:49.55]I don't know how you get this ball to go in this hole.
[208:54.67]You know, it would be okay, do it, go, but the line's too thick.
[208:59.89]I mean... I don't know.
[209:15.26]I have to, like, get it to hit this way?
[209:23.09]How big does... It's got to be better than that, come on.
[209:37.34]Catapult, catapult, catapult.
[209:38.68]Yeah, I know.
[209:39.60]So it has to be launched from this side.
[209:41.64]But how the fuck am I going to do that?
[209:47.30]You can make it with one line.
[209:50.26]The line is the fulcrum.
[209:53.26]Don't let these clowns bully you.
[209:54.98]Just do your best.
[209:57.08]If they were still VIPs, I would VIP you for five.
[210:01.34]You know what I mean?
[210:02.09]Alright.
[210:05.89]So, it needs to... The ball needs to fall here.
[210:08.43]It needs to launch from this side.
[210:10.03]That way.
[210:10.31]This is going to be such a... This is going to be impossible.
[210:14.90]Just make a half-pipe?
[210:22.83]I didn't even want it to go that way.
[210:24.05]I don't think this is ever going to work like this.
[210:40.74]Maybe like support beams.
[211:51.81]What?
[211:52.91]That actually kind of worked.
[212:48.20]Fall that way.
[212:49.04]The weight is on the right side.
[212:50.52]There's no weight over here.
[212:58.73]Look at how heavy this fucking thing is.
[213:00.11]I don't know anything about leverage.
[213:04.67]Guys, I don't even know how to change a tire.
[213:05.97]I have no idea how to do that.
[213:16.86]Guess what?
[213:18.70]None of you do either!
[213:21.81]None of us do!
[213:25.31]It's a- That's a big problem, isn't it?
[213:34.79]The best part about this is... If I can't do something, just say everybody else can't either.
[213:40.51]That's... That's how I get a... How I feel better.
[213:54.19]This is the kind of shit that you go to, like, school for eight years to do all this.
[213:59.26]So you can fucking figure out this puzzle correctly.
[214:24.90]How is this not weigh so much more?
[214:29.16]Like the weight thing, I don't understand.
[214:31.34]I made a ball and it's not heavy.
[214:38.33]This ball is fucking massive.
[214:40.17]How is this not pulling down so hard?
[214:57.78]Oh, you gotta be fucking kidding me.
[214:59.34]I can bump it in there, can I?
[215:06.95]Definitely.
[215:16.07]Make the ball touch the left wall.
[215:22.28]OK.
[215:23.92]Seems kind of easy.
[215:27.66]Thought this would be kind of a hard one.
[216:00.93]okay hold on so I have to touch this I guess I could just touch it with something that never hits the ground over here so I go like this but it's not like this is going to be a big right like who cares well I've had it just hook this and have it go like this is it going to stand
[216:47.60]Alright, wait a second.
[216:49.56]What are you doing?
[216:52.72]I'm listening to Pizza Tower.
[217:06.39]What happens if I fill this?
[217:07.99]What will this do?
[217:08.66]I just want to see what happens.
[217:17.55]OK, so I just wanna see it up.
[217:26.15]OK.
[217:26.23]You're only 18 in 3 1⁄2 hours.
[217:26.95]Bro, this is like the fourth game mode I've played.
[217:30.83]Gotta go back and watch the VOD OK.
[217:51.31]Hold on a second.
[218:01.36]How's this for some fucking IQ?
[218:07.02]How's that for a little bit of IQ?
[218:44.98]That did not work.
[218:47.20]I forgot it falls.
[219:02.17]Um
[219:04.80]I have to like... Okay, so here's the weird part.
[219:07.25]I have to activate it first because it won't pull it when I... I have to turn it on first.
[219:14.67]I can do that.
[219:15.29]Hmm.
[219:16.91]I mean, could I effectively just put balls in here and pump it that way?
[219:27.91]Hmm.
[219:37.32]Okay.
[219:37.64]So I got an idea.
[219:40.92]We'll just, we'll just hook him for a second.
[219:43.86]Hold on.
[219:45.69]I said that needs to go the other way.
[219:54.03]Okay.
[219:58.67]Got to go all the way around.
[219:59.73]Boom.
[220:32.61]Right idea, but the wrong placement.
[220:37.02]I almost think I could make a ramp.
[220:39.18]What if I go like this?
[220:41.64]And then... Hold on.
[220:45.66]What if I go like that?
[220:46.60]And then... Like... Like this?
[220:56.67]Never mind.
[220:57.07]Actually, it might help.
[221:04.29]Hold on a minute.
[221:09.16]not at all so how do I get this to spin completely almost 180 degrees this way or this way well I can't it's not going to be able to ever go this way so it has to go flip to the left it has to
[221:38.31]Wait a minute.
[221:39.22]Okay, hold on.
[221:44.60]Okay, that's kind of cheating, but that kind of works.
[222:16.21]Oh, we're almost there.
[222:18.07]Look.
[222:20.06]Now I just have to go like that.
[222:24.66]And no.
[222:25.14]It's got to be like harsher.
[222:52.47]It's gotta be like a sharp point.
[222:53.79]Maybe lower.
[222:58.90]No.
[223:04.73]There it is.
[223:06.37]Just knock it this way and I'm done.
[223:25.71]It'll bounce back, it'll bounce back.
[223:28.00]Ah!
[223:28.10]Alright, now we just wait.
[223:44.70]He didn't read chat, surely.
[223:47.06]Was it chat?
[223:47.56]I thought I was just talking to my mom.
[223:53.02]Oh yeah, this is bad.
[224:02.78]Is this salvageable?
[224:03.44]Okay.
[224:06.50]Now is the pull back this way and it should be good.
[224:11.17]You know what we're doing?
[225:09.45]Alright, now cut the shit and just move it.
[225:12.42]Just pull it this way.
[225:17.64]Grab this and hook it over here.
[225:24.84]Finally.
[225:27.23]Now just move that.
[225:33.59]This will do it.
[225:35.89]Still got it.
[225:38.23]Alright, this is the last one.
[225:39.94]And then we'll see what my actual IQ is.
[227:02.13]Wolfram Frank.
[227:09.83]This is it.
[227:11.57]This is going to be it right here.
[227:12.54]Check it out.
[227:15.04]This is it.
[228:29.67]That's what I was trying to do.
[228:32.11]I think it's close enough.
[229:02.94]There it is.
[229:04.56]Alright, let's go.
[230:22.85]No, I'm there.
[230:23.65]I'm right there.
[230:34.76]This is an AI learning program.
[230:47.10]Yeah, and guess what?
[230:48.00]That AI does this shit like 50 million times before it understands it.
[230:52.93]Dude, you're poisoning the data right now.
[230:55.22]I'm fine.
[231:05.23]I just... I don't know.
[231:07.04]Anytime the word pulley, lever, or hook is in the conversation, I'm talking about Star Wars with three or four other people in the room.
[231:18.50]You know what I'm saying?
[231:20.52]Like, I very much enjoy gardening.
[231:22.16]You know what I mean?
[231:24.12]I like to garden.
[231:28.41]I could tell you about gardening.
[231:30.53]How to fertilize well.
[231:37.05]I don't... I don't know about pulleys.
[231:38.53]I don't know about weight distributions.
[231:40.87]Forklift... things.
[231:42.87]I don't know that.
[231:43.39]That's a skill.
[231:46.79]That's a skill.
[231:47.81]That's a really... That's a skill that you have to learn.
[231:59.03]What is the perfect pH value in water for cannabis plants?
[232:02.03]I don't grow cannabis.
[232:03.85]So I can't answer that question.
[232:05.45]Nice gotcha, though.
[232:20.45]Alright, we're doing it my way.
[232:50.25]I really expect us to believe you just grow in sunflowers and never delved into the devil's plant.
[232:59.47]I like marijuana.
[233:00.87]I don't grow marijuana.
[233:06.04]How do I get out of here?
[233:07.20]How do I figure this out?
[233:10.58]I can't figure out how to do all the shit to twist and pull and grab and...
[233:16.81]How about like this?
[233:17.59]Is this stupid?
[233:19.03]Looks like a dumb idea.
[233:27.39]What if I just do this?
[233:30.68]And then drop a ball here and just flip it.
[233:32.58]Does that work?
[233:38.38]It grips it?
[233:38.96]Correctly.
[233:39.38]Theoretically should.
[233:40.47]Theoretically.
[233:41.87]My hypothesis is this looks like it's going pretty well.
[233:45.19]Okay.
[233:46.96]deduction deduced.
[234:12.19]so
[234:29.44]Ah.
[235:02.28]Pick it up with your hand.
[235:06.59]This dude's obsessed with fulcrums.
[235:08.47]Um... I did this one before.
[235:11.83]I don't... It's like grabbing it and having it be like, up, left, down, up, weight, counterweight, counterweight this way.
[235:20.89]No, I don't... I don't... I have no idea.
[235:34.02]I just want to just tip it.
[235:38.88]But I won't do it.
[235:53.20]Because I'm trying to make a hook, but eventually it's too big because I can only draw a certain size.
[235:59.10]Alright.
[236:00.71]Well, hold on.
[236:02.27]Is it now possible for me to pull this?
[236:04.19]Can I just whack this now?
[236:06.17]This is it.
[236:20.60]This has to be it.
[236:29.11]Everybody say a prayer because this is it.
[236:31.25]This is question 20.
[236:58.14]Ha, you can't make it smaller.
[237:29.68]I didn't even mean to do it, but I just solved it.
[237:32.46]I just made a makeshift fulcrum.
[237:38.28]I didn't even mean to solve it.
[237:39.24]I don't know.
[237:57.57]Okay, what about this?
[238:01.07]Like, no, stop, stop, stop.
[238:02.86]I wish I could just change how big the painter is.
[238:32.61]Alright.
[238:34.16]What the fuck?
[238:36.96]Why is your chat so toxic?
[238:39.64]Um, I don't... Are you guys toxic?
[238:42.18]Yes or no?
[238:42.56]This is a yes or no question.
[238:45.16]Are you guys toxic?
[238:47.30]Yes or no?
[238:47.70]And I want you to be honest.
[238:50.76]He knows you're saying yes?
[238:52.92]Work on that.
[238:54.96]Work on that.
[238:55.54]I ain't gonna say it again.
[238:58.24]Work on that.
[238:58.80]Kinda looks like a nose.
[239:06.69]Okay.
[239:09.78]So what if... Take a stick and a box at the end?
[239:15.06]That might work.
[239:23.17]Work on being even more toxic?
[239:29.69]Now you got me angry.
[239:32.11]I've been hanging out, just chilling, playing this game.
[239:34.85]Now you've really, really pissed me off.
[239:36.84]You ready?
[239:37.14]I'm going to beat this on the next try because of that.
[240:06.17]I just don't get it.
[240:07.15]I know a lot of people probably get it.
[240:10.92]And they're like, dude, I get it.
[240:11.84]I don't get it.
[240:15.90]I would get it if I could shrink the paintbrush.
[240:19.10]I don't get it.
[240:31.22]Have you seen the new butthole emoji?
[240:33.02]No, I haven't.
[240:34.74]I hope your head makes you happy.
[240:38.08]You do you.
[240:39.24]How do I do this?
[241:18.72]Actually, I'm like completely stumped.
[241:21.90]I don't... I don't... I don't get how you can make a hook that can pull it down without hitting the ground.
[241:28.99]And have it go all the way over.
[241:30.15]I guess that's kind of correct.
[241:36.43]Maybe just... Hold on, let me try that again.
[241:49.77]Because it's too big.
[241:56.37]Everything's too big.
[241:57.09]I can't make it smaller.
[242:02.52]If I could make the hook part smaller... It's kind of correct.
[242:08.78]Hold on.
[242:09.06]What if I...
[242:25.61]Eh.
[242:27.15]Go the other way.
[242:27.83]With the weight facing the other side.
[242:30.01]I don't know how far out I should go.
[242:41.14]How far should I do it?
[242:43.66]Oh, that's kind of an idea.
[242:44.72]That's not a bad idea.
[242:53.63]I think I'll get it doing this.
[243:04.29]Is that enough space?
[243:07.60]Ugh!
[243:11.60]Sounds like it needs that, like, gap there.
[243:20.25]It's close.
[243:35.09]It's so close.
[243:35.93]But it's not going to do it.
[243:40.87]Can I just bump it?
[243:42.80]I'm going back to this.
[243:46.96]This is... Hold on.
[244:16.33]Make a brace for it.
[244:18.15]And then maybe it'll just flip over?
[244:25.34]Wait.
[244:34.18]Book fulcrum, left side fulcrum.
[244:37.49]Need to lift the left one.
[244:45.01]What if I do it thin?
[244:47.69]Hold on.
[244:51.10]Look at how thin that is.
[244:52.00]Alright.
[244:55.00]Alright.
[244:55.54]You got thin crust or thicker crust for pizza?
[244:58.91]Get them distracted so they stop, you know, making fun of me.
[245:22.07]Okay, now let's really get it some momentum.
[245:25.29]Go.
[245:27.65]Oh my god!
[245:30.73]There it is.
[245:33.32]I don't want to freak out, but I think I'm in trouble.
[245:38.28]I kind of need to hit it again.
[245:52.10]Yes!
[245:53.64]It was correct!
[245:59.63]Alright.
[246:00.69]It's time to get the results.
[246:02.95]My IQ is... You ready?
[246:25.85]What was the song I need?
[246:31.07]What's this?
[246:31.47]The, uh, what's the song?
[246:33.09]I'm going to drag this out.
[246:34.51]What's the song when Saitama is going to punch somebody in one punch man.
[246:38.97]And it goes, what's it called?
[246:46.32]I'm going to do the thing where like I play it as epic song and reveal it.
[246:53.36]What's it called?
[246:57.83]It's Saitama's theme.
[247:09.40]Is this it?
[247:09.70]I don't hear anything.
[247:18.31]I don't hear it.
[247:18.71]How do I not hear anything?
[247:21.23]That's weird.
[247:27.69]Do you think it's over or under 100?
[247:28.75]Oh, there we go.
[247:37.09]Now I can hear.
[247:38.43]Alright, is it over or under 100?
[247:39.55]You guys ready?
[247:40.53]Here comes the epic thing.
[247:41.77]So I took an IQ test today.
[247:52.12]And it made me understand.
[247:57.20]And it doesn't matter if you're good at puzzles.
[248:00.82]Doesn't matter if you can dodge a battle axe.
[248:02.12]Doesn't matter if you can fight anybody.
[248:05.92]We're all strong inside.
[248:09.50]We all have what it takes.
[248:12.24]Whatever is underneath this, it doesn't matter what it is.
[248:14.97]It could be 50, it could be 100, it could be 150.
[248:17.93]Which would make me better than all of you.
[248:20.35]Way better.
[248:21.99]But even if it does say that.
[248:24.53]It could be 20, but it's not going to be.
[248:28.98]It's time to reveal the IQ.
[248:30.92]And again, don't be discouraged when you see this number.
[248:50.09]Really?
[248:50.49]Alright, I'll take it.
[248:59.48]That's better than average.
[249:02.68]Nice radio station.
[249:04.11]That's my name.
[249:05.65]Well, it was under 100.
[249:12.33]Oh, I didn't... You guys didn't... Oh, okay.
[249:21.34]Oh, shit.
[249:24.20]Alright, but... Okay, here we go.
[249:33.67]I wanted this one.
[249:40.86]Is this this one?
[249:49.26]There it is!
[250:05.91]Alright, so that's nine, nine, eight, five.
[250:09.43]Cool.
[250:10.17]That was fun.
[250:10.91]So what, efficiency?
[250:12.21]That's, okay, let's go over it.
[250:14.69]Comprehension.
[250:15.71]The ability to understand where to apply force to control the position and angle of an object.
[250:20.81]I know how to fucking punch really, really fucking hard.
[250:28.38]You understand?
[250:30.08]Insight.
[250:30.92]Wise enough to see that it is actually simple.
[250:34.42]I did alright.
[250:35.30]That's fine.
[250:41.53]Joked.
[250:44.90]Inspiration.
[250:45.62]Eye-opening thinking.
[250:47.90]That's alright.
[250:52.24]Aggressive sensations that generate large movements with strong force.
[250:58.02]Efficiency.
[250:59.04]The shrewdness of having multiple functions in one object.
[251:03.74]You give me a stick.
[251:07.63]And that stick... I use that stick to swing at people.
[251:11.35]In the caveman lands.
[251:13.97]I'm not going to make it a tool.
[251:18.89]But I'll tell you.
[251:22.41]I can comprehend a stick.
[251:29.43]It's so funny.
[251:34.15]Alright.
[251:34.61]I'm right at the top of the curve.
[251:40.03]This is normal.
[251:41.15]This is normal.
[251:42.13]Humans are here.
[251:43.15]Okay.
[251:43.69]I'm very, it's average.
[251:45.73]I never told you I was a super intelligent person.
[251:48.16]I mean, I feel like, I think it used to be over.
[251:53.68]This is not a real IQ test.
[251:55.08]Why am I acting like it is?
[252:00.38]The number is your username.
[252:01.72]Yeah.
[252:02.12]Jerma nine, eight, five.
[252:03.84]Perfect.
[252:07.48]You're one point below average.
[252:13.51]Whatever.
[252:16.16]You said it was going to be higher than all of us.
[252:19.62]Don't be discouraged.
[252:30.75]I'm 128.
[252:30.91]No, that's good.
[252:31.31]130 is better, but 128 is alright.
[252:45.34]I want to see a couple other things, though.
[252:54.32]That chatter is a genius.
[252:55.76]Alright, what is this?
[252:59.10]The blue ball will shrink when touched.
[253:00.78]Make it go touch the ground.
[253:04.71]That's when you have 100 IQ.
[253:06.17]That's how you figure it out real fast.
[253:08.21]Make them fit.
[253:10.31]We need some more music.
[253:19.04]Man, I love that Saitama song.
[253:22.48]Don't you?
[253:24.34]I don't even like... You know what I mean?
[253:27.23]You know what I mean, Vern?
[253:30.23]Don't bat-chest me.
[253:31.37]No, actually, don't bat-chest me.
[253:32.87]That song is great.
[253:36.91]That's an amazingly composed song.
[253:39.76]The composition in that.
[253:41.06]I know composition.
[253:42.88]You just saw that I do.
[253:45.36]It's phenomenally crafted.
[253:47.96]I know how to craft things.
[254:01.95]Alright, so you gotta go quick.
[254:04.87]I need a new OST.
[254:10.85]Did you put your IQ in your username?
[254:12.57]That's cringe.
[254:19.88]Jerma 98.5.
[254:23.34]Ocarina of Time?
[254:24.44]I did say I was gonna do Animal Crossing, that's right.
[254:34.28]You guys having fun?
[254:38.64]You having fun?
[254:38.94]Hey, you having a good time?
[254:48.48]Good.
[254:55.16]How did that not fit?
[254:57.50]That was a bug.
[255:07.07]I like this one.
[255:08.59]Orange objects will disappear when touched.
[255:10.31]Make the balloon touch the left wall.
[255:13.34]Huh.
[255:21.62]Come on.
[255:25.68]IQ under pressure is probably a lot different than sitting quietly in a testing room by yourself, yo.
[255:31.90]Water balloon.
[255:32.70]Put every drop in the beaker.
[255:34.33]Huh.
[255:40.41]Interesting.
[255:43.21]Interesting.
[255:44.05]Interesting.
[256:08.72]Nice.
[256:09.00]Where's my water level?
[256:11.10]That's an old one.
[256:12.72]That's a really old one.
[256:22.09]You know what's crazy about iPad games and mobile games now?
[256:24.91]I don't know if they were like this before.
[256:28.35]Holy shit.
[256:31.28]If you go to what the app is tracking and the privacy stuff that Apple has in the Apple Store...
[256:39.03]It is unbelievable what you need to know about me for me to play your match three video game.
[256:48.02]It's fucked.
[256:51.19]I remember looking at one.
[256:52.17]It was like, oh, like, I don't want to say a wrong game, but one of them wanted, it was going to like email, like location, precise location, purchase ID, device ID.
[257:07.66]It was literally every single possible thing.
[257:09.81]Every single possible thing.
[257:12.65]It was just like, why do you need all this information?
[257:16.43]And sometimes you'll go to one, it'd be on the app store and you're like, alright, what do they want from me now?
[257:21.66]Let me guess.
[257:22.22]You want like my fucking credit card number and everything.
[257:25.34]You want to know like who I am and everything about me.
[257:27.80]And then you scroll down.
[257:28.56]It's like, this app does not collect any information.
[257:32.89]Sometimes I just buy those.
[257:34.77]Sometimes I just buy them.
[257:36.81]I just buy them.
[257:38.41]Because, like, yup, you're, I get you.
[257:40.73]And you're fucking, you, thank you.
[257:50.02]Billionaire, millionaire, rich.
[257:52.66]I mean, a lot of these are like $2, guys.
[257:55.67]And I play them.
[257:58.28]If I'm on the fence for a mobile game... Hey, mobile game developers, I'm talking to you directly.
[258:03.10]If I'm on the fence about a mobile game, if I'm looking at it like, hmm... Alright, this is like... This is like two, three bucks.
[258:09.61]Okay.
[258:10.57]But this is like a game.
[258:12.97]I go right down there and I go, are you taking anything?
[258:15.45]If the answer is no, I'm not on the fence anymore.
[258:19.79]I'm gonna try it out.
[258:20.35]I'm gonna check it out.
[258:21.67]I'm talking to you.
[258:23.19]What about that Family Guy game?
[258:24.59]I don't know.
[258:25.07]That was like...
[258:26.43]It was like eight years ago.
[258:28.15]I don't know.
[258:28.97]I have no idea.
[258:31.53]This feature wasn't available in like iOS two or whatever it was.
[258:37.66]Yeah.
[258:45.66]And also, sometimes you go to that privacy thing and it's like, oh yeah, it's collecting, you know, like, device information.
[258:52.01]Okay, like, you know, bugs and stuff.
[258:54.97]Alright, we need to know what kind of device this is to make sure.
[258:58.17]I'm alright with that.
[258:59.27]I'm okay with device kind of information.
[259:02.77]That's fine.
[259:04.03]That is fine.
[259:09.17]But once it's like, hey, um, what are your emails?
[259:15.44]I don't... What are you talking about?
[259:24.01]Oh, that was close.
[259:27.83]Oh, that was close.
[259:32.01]Right there.
[259:32.31]Right like behind the knee.
[259:37.45]And then right there.
[259:38.13]And then a little bit of a fulcrum action.
[259:44.60]And let's go for it.
[259:52.99]I actually just hit my hands on my thing.
[260:08.86]Don't do it.
[260:20.37]You have a home alone IQ?
[260:27.12]What is that?
[260:27.52]I... What does that mean?
[260:29.36]I think I know what that means.
[260:30.30]That means that, like, in a scenario where... I'm gonna be dropping paint cans on strings to hit people in the face.
[260:35.64]Is that what you mean?
[260:36.44]Like, that's what I can do?
[260:38.34]When it comes to deducing problems?
[260:43.58]Hey, Jerma, we have this complicated problem that we need to, uh... Uh, for, you know, customer information and, uh... Can you give us a hand here?
[260:51.17]Yeah.
[260:51.33]How about you put some paint cans on some string, and then when they walk in, you let go of the paint can, holding it in a pendulum fashion, and it'll break their nose and shatter their fucking face.
[261:09.87]Well, this is a marketing call, and we're trying to figure out marketing stuff.
[261:15.85]Yeah.
[261:17.28]Alright, just call me when you need me.
[261:26.62]The Home Alone movies are some of my favorite movies ever.
[261:30.54]One of the specific reasons why is because it lives in a cartoon world, but it's supposed to be like real life Chicago.
[261:38.97]If you took a paint can to the face, you might die.
[261:43.89]It might kill you.
[261:50.37]The second that one of those dudes falls down the stairs, and there's like nails sticking out, they're dead.
[262:16.40]I do love the Joe Pesci psych.
[262:22.53]Nobody does that anymore.
[262:23.41]When was the last time you heard of razza frazza?
[262:27.82]They don't do it anymore.
[262:31.76]Oh, there's also, yeah, this is one of my favorite parts of the movie.
[262:41.98]Marv literally throws a brick at this kid.
[262:44.00]Like, he's trying to hit this kid with a brick.
[262:46.28]Like, he's trying to, it's unbelievably, he throws it as hard as he can.
[262:57.46]The brick is going very fast.
[262:59.03]That's one of my favorite scenes.
[263:00.81]That was quick.
[263:11.76]They're legitimately trying to kill him in that movie.
[263:14.60]Yeah, they really are.
[263:20.16]How do I do this?
[263:23.41]You need to touch the bottom one.
[263:24.93]Well, oh Look at that Hey, I know what we got to do What are your thoughts on cheddar checks I'm gonna have to recommend you a far superior product
[263:53.12]The far superior product is the Cheez-It mix.
[263:58.32]The Cheez-It mix is the best one of all.
[264:01.82]The Cheez-It mix is Cheez-Its, which are phenomenal.
[264:05.34]They're pretzels, which are phenomenal.
[264:08.55]It's the little breads, which are phenomenal.
[264:12.73]And it's the little white puffs, which are phenomenal.
[264:16.67]Ain't no bullshit in there that you want.
[264:19.47]There's nothing you're gonna skip over there.
[264:22.97]It's only the best part of every single mixed snack mix-up thing.
[264:30.49]And it's got a lot of little breads in there.
[264:31.93]There's no complaints when you take a handful.
[264:37.16]Because sometimes when you don't... Chex ones are fine.
[264:40.76]But sometimes I get to the point where there's kind of too many Chex left.
[264:46.12]And I don't really want to eat Chex anymore.
[264:48.36]That does not happen at all.
[264:51.12]when eating the Cheez-It one.
[264:52.99]So, that answers your question.
[266:00.05]Really?
[266:14.48]What is going on here?
[266:19.60]What is happening?
[266:22.74]Oh, I get it.
[266:30.77]I need to like swing it.
[266:37.53]How am I going to do that?
[266:59.67]I got to yank it.
[267:16.02]Wait, what if I do this?
[267:25.10]This might be kind of weird.
[268:26.20]leave only one well that's easy make the ball touch all the red area
[268:55.66]That ball?
[269:47.80]I'm sorry, yeah, I said shoot.
[269:52.56]Uh... I don't know.
[270:05.64]All I know how to do is make seesaws and fulcrums.
[270:09.40]And hooks that don't work.
[270:47.90]Make a hammer and have it pivot around the center.
[271:28.29]Is it?
[271:32.03]Oh.
[271:51.33]I did it, yes.
[271:57.13]New question.
[272:00.55]Keep you drawing in the red area, huh?
[272:33.58]Yeah.
[273:01.51]Three, two, oh.
[273:06.61]Three, two, one.
[273:33.68]Put all the blue balls in the beaker.
[273:35.36]I think I can handle that.
[273:49.56]I think I can handle it.
[273:50.56]I'm quite sure about that.
[274:09.79]We get it, you watched that movie like a week ago.
[274:12.14]Yeah... So what?
[274:22.38]Can you please say stones the way that you do?
[274:26.01]Mmm... I don't know... How many subs came in today?
[274:39.29]The stones.
[274:39.65]What the fuck did I think that was going to do?
[275:01.25]Kind of worked.
[275:50.25]Do the springs actually do that?
[275:53.84]Can I make these?
[276:20.88]Make all the yellow balls touch the red area.
[276:25.56]Ooh.
[276:28.52]Well.
[276:33.64]Uh.
[276:33.70]How do I do this?
[276:41.15]Is it time for a fulcrum?
[276:44.43]It might be.
[276:51.19]I think you're right.
[277:09.46]I don't know how to do this.
[277:13.28]Make the ball touch the ground.
[278:13.02]Just fill it with packing peanuts.
[278:24.48]Son of a gun.
[278:46.00]I think you're onto something, yeah?
[278:48.84]Make the balloon touch the left wall.
[279:08.17]How is this gonna get through?
[279:22.44]Okay, is this gonna get through?
[279:33.58]I mean, can the ball even fit through there?
[280:03.51]Hmm.
[280:45.01]put all the red balls in the box it's an easy task just got to get a little bit of wedge action in here
[281:32.16]Fuck!
[281:36.58]Make the balloon touch the left wall.
[281:47.37]Wait, I have to pop that.
[281:49.69]How am I gonna pop this?
[281:50.85]Oh, I know.
[281:59.12]With displacement.
[282:23.55]touch it already touch it it was never gonna work was it maybe it will
[282:58.14]Oh, wait a minute.
[282:58.86]Okay, I can do it with displacement.
[283:10.74]What are you?
[283:11.60]What?
[283:11.90]Touch that wall.
[283:18.45]Uh-oh.
[283:20.77]I didn't think about what I was doing.
[283:24.13]It's alright, I'll get it with displacement.
[283:32.61]Shit.
[284:14.39]Alright, just touch the left wall and hurry up.
[284:27.58]Touch the wall!
[284:52.24]This shit is fucking hard.
[284:53.82]It's just like, it makes me want to just get up and run a lap.
[284:58.89]I just want to get up and run a lap.
[285:00.77]I just need to move.
[285:02.67]You know, do you know what I mean?
[285:03.61]You know what I'm saying?
[285:04.17]You know what I mean, Vern?
[285:06.78]I've said it like a thousand times tonight.
[285:34.57]Got it.
[285:37.48]Got it.
[285:40.29]Put more than five blue balls in the beaker.
[286:12.81]Oh, displacement.
[286:33.48]How would you ever make this work?
[286:46.24]How would I scoop?
[286:59.69]Make a spoon?
[287:10.68]That's not how a spoon goes.
[287:30.12]I don't... I mean, how do I make it scoop?
[287:44.32]Like, how?
[287:45.94]How would I make it?
[287:47.16]All it does is fall down.
[288:04.48]How the hell do I make a wedge?
[288:25.05]Make it pointing down.
[288:38.55]I love his brain.
[288:41.79]Just make it straight.
[288:43.79]Like a knife just falling straight down the middle.
[288:45.75]But how am I going to scoop him into the thing?
[288:47.45]That doesn't help me at all.
[288:50.59]I mean...
[289:11.22]More than five, by the way.
[289:12.30]I don't think that's gonna happen.
[289:17.06]Or is it?
[289:30.21]Remember how a shovel works?
[289:31.97]Yes, a shovel works by me digging down and then lifting up.
[289:37.80]All I can do is let go of the shovel in my hands and drop it on the ground.
[289:42.50]See what I'm saying?
[290:01.21]So here's your shovel.
[290:04.15]These are my fingers.
[290:05.83]Grabbing it, right?
[290:06.79]So I'm grabbing onto the shovel.
[290:08.13]Here are my arms.
[290:11.73]And this is... We're not gonna finish that drawing.
[290:26.92]Oh, that's one, two!
[290:28.94]I think I can just do it.
[290:29.98]I'll just get it.
[290:30.66]Ready?
[290:32.57]We're just driving a nail into this.
[291:00.53]Put one of the balls on the ground.
[291:12.72]What?
[291:31.93]That's fun.
[291:33.47]What was this one?
[291:34.05]No, okay, I did a lot of these already.
[291:38.15]What about this one?
[291:40.66]Touch all the orange balls.
[291:41.85]The orange balls will explode when touched.
[292:10.97]Why would you do it any other way?
[292:11.85]This is gonna be really hard
[292:42.15]It's still possible?
[292:49.23]That right side.
[293:12.91]Get in there.
[293:14.49]It's right there.
[293:29.42]That's annoying.
[293:32.04]It might wedge in.
[293:36.98]No.
[293:47.74]This is my, like, how annoying can I be in one day stream?
[293:51.06]I think we're getting our limit.
[293:56.57]Mmm, okay.
[294:12.40]I think I can just drop it from here.
[294:21.51]Just don't get rid of area.
[294:23.01]Why would I get rid of everything though?
[294:29.60]Make the red ball touch the red area.
[294:36.57]This is moving.
[294:48.06]It's not something weird like... Hold on.
[294:50.04]I just want to see what happens.
[294:51.27]Oh, I can't even... Wait, what?
[294:56.61]Oh.
[295:03.43]I see.
[295:03.87]Okay.
[295:08.55]You have to blow into your mic for this one.
[295:09.98]It's interactive.
[295:13.60]What was that on the DS?
[295:17.01]DS game.
[295:20.57]I think I'm just going to make a big one.
[295:21.73]Does that work?
[295:28.22]Yeah.
[295:29.74]Oh, keep going.
[295:31.50]There it is.
[295:32.88]Oh, no, it's not.
[295:33.58]Uh-oh.
[295:47.90]Keep going.
[295:57.49]Keep going.
[295:58.67]Almost there.
[296:07.84]There it is.
[296:08.80]Yes.
[296:16.73]Ooh, okay, this shouldn't be that bad.
[296:28.85]It's not that bad.
[296:35.09]And I've even made him do a front flip.
[296:40.30]Uh, what?
[296:54.27]Come on, do it.
[296:57.05]That should be good.
[296:58.61]Oh, no.
[297:05.17]Just a little too much.
[297:05.89]I think I got to queue another one up.
[297:12.69]Yep, just like that.
[297:14.91]Got to do one and then drop this one from a little bit higher.
[297:39.39]I can't draw in this circle.
[297:41.03]So for when yelling at me.
[297:46.21]I just had it too.
[297:47.05]And one chat member got in my head.
[297:48.46]I just beat it.
[298:11.79]Why did I let it go?
[298:16.95]Really stopped it perfectly in his foot.
[298:23.62]Alright, don't move.
[298:27.66]Very nice.
[298:28.38]Very nice.
[298:28.90]Make the red areas touch each other.
[298:32.06]Oh my goodness.
[298:51.97]This kinda hurts my head.
[298:52.88]Got it.
[299:07.89]Make all the red squares fly out of the screen.
[299:26.07]Drop some big balls on it?
[299:27.57]I think that's probably correct.
[299:41.01]What else we got?
[299:43.57]Did this one.
[299:46.45]Did that one.
[299:47.09]Make the rabbit touch the flag.
[299:50.82]It's slippery.
[299:56.24]That'll be enough.
[299:56.66]Is it too much?
[300:11.69]Just a little.
[300:17.89]How gentle do I have to be?
[300:19.09]Okay.
[300:33.96]It'll get there.
[300:37.60]Let's give it a second.
[300:54.65]Move the red thing into the screen.
[301:02.27]move the red thing into the screen.
[301:59.43]Wait, I got an idea.
[302:09.79]Well, that was bad, but whatever.
[302:13.81]It was bad.
[302:14.21]Okay, I'll get it right.
[302:35.10]Alright.
[302:37.39]Inched out a little.
[302:47.05]Come on.
[302:54.44]Yep.
[302:55.88]Oh, I blocked it.
[303:12.91]pull it like I don't know what am I supposed to pinch it out does that help
[303:42.75]Way too far.
[304:08.36]You know what I'm doing.
[304:10.44]Let's fucking go.
[304:40.86]Oh, almost worked.
[304:43.86]Almost worked.
[304:48.36]You know what I'm doing?
[304:49.92]Going for it again.
[304:56.46]Would you guys allow me one more Quasimodo?
[305:01.63]Can I do one more?
[305:06.09]Can we do a poll, please?
[305:07.27]Can I say Quasimodo as that character one more time?
[305:17.17]Just do a poll.
[305:18.33]That's why I'm.
[305:29.98]It's gonna work.
[305:57.98]It's your stream, man.
[305:59.14]Wash your butt off.
[306:34.92]I don't know.
[306:35.20]I can't grip it, though.
[306:36.26]That's not a bad idea.
[306:51.33]Wait a minute.
[306:55.81]We use, um... Displacement.
[307:16.25]Yes, 83% said I could do it again.
[307:18.15]Hook the top.
[307:22.57]Yeah, I'm not very good at this.
[307:23.42]It's okay though.
[307:24.52]I'm just having fun.
[307:29.54]You mean like this part here?
[307:30.74]That's actually a... If that's what you mean, then that's definitely a great idea.
[307:52.72]Can I weigh in the end down?
[308:03.84]Can I weigh it down?
[308:04.52]I think it's too heavy.
[308:28.87]Grab top and slide to lock it in.
[308:30.75]I don't know how you do a pulling action.
[308:42.56]I don't know.
[308:43.26]Someone's smart to figure it out.
[308:47.21]Pour it out.
[309:01.30]Oh, I did it.
[309:06.11]I did it?
[309:08.41]I did it.
[309:11.21]I kind of did it.
[309:12.45]I did it.
[309:32.78]Did I do it?
[309:38.22]Did I do it?
[309:39.90]I didn't do it.
[310:00.01]I had a lot of momentum on it.
[310:05.03]Just rip it down.
[310:06.61]No!
[310:14.62]Alright, now get out of the way!
[310:20.03]That's per- that was perfect.
[310:40.08]Oh, more!
[310:54.84]That has to be it.
[311:11.62]I don't think so.
[311:17.51]It went back in, yeah.
[311:19.27]I wish we just stopped moving.
[311:21.37]It's hard to actually hook onto it.
[311:28.01]Alright, now it's coming out.
[311:29.17]But now it's going back.
[311:30.55]No, there it is.
[311:32.06]God damn it.
[311:32.52]Does this have to be longer, maybe?
[311:35.86]I don't know how much longer I'd want to make it.
[311:42.08]Till I pull it there, like pull it back.
[311:45.68]Oh, yes.
[311:46.16]Alright.
[311:46.50]Now keep going, please.
[311:54.77]Come on, do it.
[311:56.51]No, it got to the end and screwed up.
[311:59.73]Wait.
[312:04.98]Oh, don't do this to me right now, please.
[312:07.48]Oh, my God.
[312:10.72]Shit.
[312:35.91]What is even happening right now?
[312:40.11]Wouldn't it have to go out this way?
[313:00.44]You have to get it to go on its own.
[313:07.57]I think that will weigh it down enough.
[313:10.41]And then fall off.
[313:12.11]And then fall off.
[313:15.03]And then fall off.
[313:18.85]Alright, it fell off.
[313:20.57]Uh-oh.
[313:29.68]Fall off.
[313:31.60]Alright, now do it naturally.
[313:35.10]There it is.
[313:36.34]Get it out.
[313:39.28]Should be perfect now.
[313:40.50]It's look at it.
[313:41.28]And then look, it bugged out again.
[313:42.79]No, I think it's good.
[313:43.83]Good.
[313:45.59]Almost.
[313:46.67]No shit.
[313:47.49]What the hell's going on here?
[314:03.81]Fuck.
[314:10.56]It's too wide.
[314:11.60]I don't want to make it this wide.
[314:15.41]Can I pull it down?
[314:22.03]Spin it!
[314:35.06]This is a physics puzzle.
[314:37.64]Where the physics fall out of the hole.
[314:45.34]Alright, so the thing's going and then it just like detaches.
[314:50.80]Like, why does it pull out and start going in a random direction?
[314:53.28]Okay.
[315:18.15]What just happened?
[315:18.77]I can't- I'm not even allowed to do what I just did, and I just did it.
[315:34.73]Alright.
[315:35.97]Start- ugh.
[315:37.89]Alright, it's gonna have momentum.
[315:56.28]Alright, go.
[316:01.24]Alright.
[316:02.66]Now can I stop it?
[316:04.50]It's still kind of going.
[316:05.43]Let's see if it's all fucked up again.
[316:21.15]What's happening here?
[316:24.89]What is going on?
[316:38.00]Shouldn't it be going like this still?
[316:40.27]Like, how would it be stuck here?
[316:42.32]Like falling out of the back?
[316:45.84]Why is it keeps doing that?
[317:14.14]So what's the play here?
[317:14.94]I don't... I don't get it.
[317:23.92]Hook it again?
[317:24.48]But I... I'm blocking it now.
[317:29.38]It doesn't weigh enough to keep going.
[317:32.65]Should I just try to... I don't know.
[317:50.06]just pull it off push it out with balls I don't want to get any stuck in here I feel like it's so close I just want to drag it off
[318:11.23]I guess I could go like this.
[318:12.61]Can I like just pull it down from here?
[318:14.85]There it is.
[318:17.47]And that should be.
[318:18.25]Alright.
[318:19.25]We're getting there.
[318:19.71]We're getting somewhere.
[318:20.31]We're getting somewhere.
[318:35.91]I'm afraid to hook it, but I'm going to.
[318:44.83]Alright, we're... Oh, is it in the perfect spot to just fucking ruin everything?
[318:48.57]Come on, dude, really?
[318:50.79]No, it's not.
[318:55.20]You hooked it too deep?
[319:00.80]I think I can still do it, though.
[319:01.94]Hold on.
[319:04.38]I think I can do it if I go like this and just have it drag it a little.
[319:13.38]I'm gonna grab the whole thing.
[319:17.20]And like, spin it.
[319:37.09]Do it!
[319:40.77]No.
[319:40.97]What is happening?
[319:44.85]Pull it down.
[319:46.18]Pull it down.
[319:47.30]You can do it.
[319:49.98]It's not over.
[319:50.56]It's not over yet.
[319:51.10]A little bit more weight has to be up here.
[319:55.12]I'm going to wait until it gets to here and then let it go.
[320:02.55]I'm going the other way.
[320:12.04]Okay, alright.
[320:13.28]There's a little bit of progress.
[320:14.50]At least I moved it.
[320:22.54]Drag it down!
[320:23.30]This is my last try and I'm done.
[320:42.83]Okay.
[320:47.42]That was a good pull.
[320:49.24]Very good.
[320:50.16]That was a great start.
[320:52.14]Okay, now what do I do?
[320:58.54]Good start.
[320:59.88]Phenomenal start.
[321:02.41]I'm just going to pull it down like this.
[321:05.49]I'm not putting anything in there yet.
[321:15.86]I'm so afraid to hook this wrong.
[321:29.55]Do an L?
[321:33.35]You mean, okay, so you mean like this?
[321:36.94]Like that?
[321:40.22]Like that.
[321:42.59]Hook with L?
[321:44.35]Do a seven hook?
[321:46.73]Hook an L. An L will fall, yeah.
[321:50.53]No, not an L. Go all the way, please!
[322:01.56]Okay, it's almost there.
[322:06.54]Ah!
[322:17.11]I'm so scared to fuck this up.
[322:21.00]I'm sorry.
[322:46.57]It's so close.
[322:48.45]That's it right there.
[322:49.09]I win.
[322:50.05]Yep.
[322:50.43]There it is.
[322:50.89]Thank God.
[322:57.47]Throw the thing out to the left side.
[323:01.99]Throw the thing out to the left side.
[323:03.36]I don't get it.
[323:06.70]Huh?
[323:40.27]I'm so glad that that went completely off-screen, because I don't even know what it was.
[323:43.15]I got it.
[323:59.18]Okay.
[324:01.22]So I just gotta pull it now?
[324:03.12]How can I pull it from here?
[324:32.63]Urban idea.
[324:43.94]See if it works.
[324:56.59]Yep.
[325:18.05]You gotta pull it off screen.
[325:29.72]Come on!
[325:30.34]Crunch it!
[325:56.60]We yanked!
[325:57.28]Uh-oh.
[325:59.84]What was wrong with that?
[326:04.14]How did I not yank it?
[326:05.98]I pulled it all the way to the left.
[326:06.89]That's weird.
[326:08.11]Alright, this is the last one.
[326:12.37]And I'm gonna call it for tonight.
[326:15.41]This game's fun, though.
[326:16.31]If you have a brain, and it works, and you have, I would say, at least a 7th grade education, you probably have a good time playing it.
[326:33.28]I wonder should it be bigger here in the middle?
[326:46.61]Oh, I'll try the hell levels.
[326:47.55]That's going to do.
[326:51.15]It didn't even grip.
[327:12.26]I wish there was a fill tool.
[327:14.51]I would use it right now.
[327:31.96]Oh, I got it.
[327:34.14]I got it.
[327:36.26]Um, pull it down.
[327:37.52]How far?
[327:38.16]How big is this thing?
[327:41.84]I yanked it!
[327:42.72]It's a- it's a- I won.
[328:05.79]What?
[328:09.53]Keep going?
[328:27.21]We'll get it already.
[328:28.05]I wonder, is it stuck?
[328:35.72]More at the top?
[328:46.60]I just dragged it.
[328:49.26]More ramp?
[329:05.51]I don't think I can get it.
[329:06.27]Inch it in the middle.
[329:25.62]I don't think I can.
[329:42.62]Alright, I'm done.
[329:43.62]Wait.
[329:48.15]Look at how many levels there are.
[329:49.13]This is ridiculous.
[329:51.07]Let the red ball touch the ground.
[329:52.53]Okay, can't make anything up there.
[329:56.50]Can't make anything down here.
[330:20.49]I have an idea.
[330:21.01]I'm curious.
[330:28.03]It's too bouncy.
[330:39.38]Jeremy, you're crazy, dude.
[330:42.00]I'm alright.
[330:59.66]Okay.
[331:15.05]Alright.
[331:16.43]So I effectively... made a exit to... I have a new idea.
[331:56.43]Okay.
[331:57.71]Okay.
[332:41.05]It doesn't weigh enough.
[332:50.39]I apologize.
[332:51.25]I looked up the IQ 130 speedrun record and it's all hooks with balls attached to them.
[332:57.05]I should have not slandered you.
[333:02.08]Thank you.
[333:03.00]I really appreciate it.
[333:09.83]Hmm... Okay, this one's crazy.
[333:12.19]Uh... What?
[333:32.58]10 or more objects?
[333:36.43]I guess, like, the only way to do this is to click a million times, right?
[333:45.93]Oh my god.
[333:50.50]You have to move the... I can't do it in the same spot.
[334:00.96]I...
[334:04.57]It's too hard, because you have to move the mouse too.
[334:06.84]That's fucking impossible.
[334:31.09]Hold on.
[334:31.37]Let me get in the right mindset here.
[334:54.86]I'm gonna take the music out, and I'm just gonna go.
[335:10.78]Shit.
[335:11.42]I'll get it.
[335:15.72]I'm in, like, a shitty position here.
[335:17.36]I need to, like, I need to get leverage on them.
[335:25.23]Alright, I'm on the ground.
[335:56.06]I almost had it.
[335:56.44]It's just, it's the, having to drag the mouse too is like fucking impossible.
[336:02.61]Hold on.
[336:11.91]Alright.
[336:46.91]Oh.
[336:56.53]Let's go.
[336:57.21]I get it.
[337:09.86]How many is that?
[337:16.85]This is actually really fucking hard.
[337:18.28]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[337:53.03]This is the good way to do it.
[338:00.00]This is... How many is that?
[338:11.67]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6... No, hold on.
[338:12.25]I gotta get, like, 5 or 6 out of this, but...
[338:40.62]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[338:40.98]My fucking hand hurts.
[339:44.36]Why did I do it the other way?
[339:45.43]My whole body hurts now.
[340:05.83]Okay, that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[340:07.09]Ay!
[340:07.19]This game is like crashing.
[340:09.13]Something's wrong.
[340:10.79]Hold on.
[340:41.30]Oh, shit!
[340:42.50]I can't... It hurts!
[340:49.58]1, 2, 3... 4... 5... 6... 7... 8... 9... 10!
[340:55.57]Ay!
[341:28.41]Go left and right instead of... Ah, that's a good idea.
[341:48.28]Nine every time!
[342:22.91]Damn it!
[342:25.25]I can't!
[342:40.52]It's so hard.
[342:41.88]It just, like, hurts to do.
[342:58.33]Where's the actual game area, okay?
[343:00.21]Like, look it.
[343:00.62]It's not even the right area.
[343:02.20]I can't click up here?
[343:04.08]Stupid.
[343:21.92]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[343:31.78]That's 10 objects on the screen.
[343:33.82]Where's the... What are you talking about?
[343:35.15]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[343:36.51]This is 10, right?
[343:39.59]No, it's not.
[343:46.85]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[344:12.83]No, the lag just ruined everything.
[344:15.04]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[344:19.05]You gotta be fucking kidding me, dude.
[344:40.76]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[344:41.00]What?
[344:41.12]I got 5 here.
[344:41.38]6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[345:24.85]Holy shit, what a great idea.
[345:25.79]This is a great idea.
[345:26.43]Look at this idea.
[345:27.37]Watch this idea.
[345:30.55]Watch this shit.
[345:31.20]Ready?
[345:40.48]I got it.
[345:43.90]This is the one right here.
[345:44.79]Guaranteed.
[345:49.05]It's coming.
[345:49.47]You know it is.
[345:57.17]That's it right here.
[346:03.48]Okay.
[346:41.09]It's a finicky fucking game, okay?
[346:43.29]It's finicky.
[347:02.08]Ha!
[347:19.50]I'm gonna fucking eat my hand in a second.
[347:30.22]Oh my god.
[347:48.54]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[347:52.08]I'm going to bite my fingernails.
[348:08.11]I did it.
[348:08.39]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[348:13.42]That was fun.
[348:24.70]That was crazy.
[348:25.42]Alright, guys.
[348:27.72]See you soon.
[348:29.34]I will see you guys in a couple days.
[348:32.44]Friday.
[348:34.21]We'll do Friday.
[348:34.99]Maybe Friday, Saturday.
[348:38.03]Friday, Saturday.
[348:38.63]Friday, Sunday.
[348:41.37]Thanks for hanging out.
[348:50.61]The game, by the way, is called Q Remastered, if you're wondering.
[348:54.45]Play this again sometime.
[348:57.17]I think I've gotten out of all the beginner and intermediate levels.
[349:00.72]To a point where you actually have to really, really be very intricate.
[349:05.52]You can't just draw hooks and seesaws anymore.
[349:11.64]But it's fun.
[349:12.88]It's a cool game.
[349:13.34]I like it a lot.
[349:14.16]It's a good idea.
[349:22.14]I had fun with it.
[349:32.95]Multiplayer would be cool with this.
[349:34.15]It would be.
[349:34.61]Yeah, I'll see you guys Friday at 4 o'clock Pacific.
[349:38.75]That's the next time I plan on streaming.
[349:40.61]Keep an eye on the sus.
[349:45.17]Thanks for watching.
[349:51.94]Anything else I wanted to talk about today?
[349:54.94]I don't think so.
[349:55.38]You're going to show the video that you're working on when it's done.
[350:17.13]Yeah, I'm working on a video.
[350:18.23]You'll see it.
[350:18.95]It's not a big deal.
[350:19.71]It really isn't.
[350:20.27]It's just a stupid.
[350:21.33]This video is probably going to be like seven minutes long.
[350:27.45]It's like a six to eight minute video.
[350:34.28]But I need to make sure I'm in the right mindset because it's going to be I'm going to it's one of my favorite videos.
[350:45.70]Is it going to go on the main channel, Jerma985?
[350:48.56]It'd be kind of funny if this was the video that I uploaded, and you'll see why when you see it.
[350:56.80]Because if you don't know that I moved over to Twitch pretty much permanently, if you don't know that and you just thought I disappeared, you're going to think I sold the channel.
[351:11.81]Because this video... Just... I mean, it's gonna be me in it.
[351:16.33]I'm gonna be talking.
[351:18.01]But you're gonna think that I sold the channel.
[351:21.48]Like, there's gonna be no way.
[351:31.45]It's gonna be so jarring for so many people.
[351:34.03]I can't... Actually, maybe I will just do it.
[351:35.51]It'll be funny.
[351:48.41]Yeah, you'll see it.
[351:50.27]It's coming out in about two weeks.
[351:54.22]Maybe earlier.
[351:54.74]It depends if I really just want to go for it.
[351:57.94]Alright.
[351:59.22]Goodnight.
[351:59.64]Goodbye.
[351:59.94]See you soon.
[352:01.42]Thanks for watching.
[352:02.04]Thanks for hanging out, obviously.

[352:09.35]See you soon.
[352:09.73]See you Friday.
[352:10.13]4 o'clock Pacific.
[352:15.41]Have a great night, everybody.
[352:17.45]See you soon.
[352:31.45]okay hold on there somebody said can you please confirm that it's not another Spider-Man update video no it is not this is a video this is a real video it's not a Spider-Man update video good guess though because that would have been a really good guess
[352:53.46]Alright.
[352:53.73]See you later.
[353:33.85]That's what he said.
[353:34.37]Jeremiah, I know you're still here reading chat.
[353:36.43]Yeah.
[353:38.61]Yeah, I am.
[353:39.91]Usually do until the video turns off.
[353:44.39]I see the shit you guys write.
[353:49.37]I'm watching.
[353:53.20]Alright, goodbye.
[354:15.87]Hey, it's me again.
[354:21.78]I'm really trying to get this to end at 5 5 5 5 5.
[354:27.45]5 hours, 55 minutes, 55 seconds.
[354:28.87]See if I can get it.
[354:29.93]Do you guys remember that?
[354:36.50]I would... Alright.
[354:38.46]I have 10 seconds to say this.
[354:40.06]Do you guys remember, like, 7 years ago?
[354:43.10]I used to end a bunch of my streams with me just screaming and then hitting end stream.
[354:48.71]That was, like, a joke for a while.
[354:50.39]Alright.
