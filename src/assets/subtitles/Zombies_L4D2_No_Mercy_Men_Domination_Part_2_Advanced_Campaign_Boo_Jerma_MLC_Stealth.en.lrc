[05:56.17]Oh, boomer.
[05:56.55]I turn around and run.
[05:57.33]You, like, turn into him.
[05:58.95]Smoker.
[06:03.11]I heard a smoker, yeah.
[06:04.37]He's through the... No.
[06:05.41]I think he's behind us.
[06:06.73]Oh, tank.
[06:07.22]Who's got a molly?
[06:07.74]I do.
[06:08.44]Oh, god.

[06:23.60]We're baiting him through the hall?
[06:25.08]Oh god.
[06:25.86]Boo is still running.
[06:28.28]Get him in this room where we can get him in an open area.
[06:30.72]Oh, he's mad.
[06:31.02]He is.
[06:31.26]I need people to unload!
[06:32.10]Help!
[06:43.15]You, like, went into a corner.
[06:44.87]Alright, it's done.
[06:45.69]Alright.
[06:46.39]You good to health?
[06:50.43]That was pretty clean.
[06:52.49]Like, we know how to kill people.
[06:54.13]Wait a minute.
[06:56.45]Can I change my FOV?
[06:58.01]Ah, boomer!
[06:59.55]FOV.
[07:01.37]Same thing, just asking to guess.
[07:03.74]Somebody watch behind us.
[07:04.86]Oh, there's a lot of people coming.
[07:07.98]You turned the corner and said, oh, boomer, and then I got hit by it, too.
[07:14.41]That's so... It's like I didn't go the last time.
[07:16.87]It's almost like you made that happen.
[07:18.83]Uh, pipe bomb on the stairs.
[07:19.69]Pipe bomb on Molotov.
[07:21.72]I'll take one.
[07:23.16]Yeah, yeah.
[07:26.34]There's a pipe bomb here!
[07:27.32]There's so... There's two ways down, but the best one's on the far right.
[07:30.22]Alright.
[07:33.32]Yeah, but this is the last part of the campaign.
[07:34.97]This is only the final, right?
[07:35.69]I think there's a medkit in the corner.
[07:36.95]Medkit in the corner.
[07:38.31]Actually, it's incendiary now.
[07:39.85]Wait, you guys are, like, running faster than they... No, I didn't... There's two medkits in here.
[07:43.29]Two medkits.
[07:45.16]Who needs it?
[07:46.04]Actually, we all have.
[07:47.78]Should be, yeah.
[07:48.36]Oh, yeah.
[07:49.24]I can take it.
[07:49.86]Where's that?
[07:50.72]Oh, jockey.
[07:51.20]It almost pulled me in the hole.
[07:53.02]Where's the other one, Boo, right here?
[07:55.54]Oh.
[07:56.24]Ah, boomer.
[07:56.82]Got him.
[07:59.73]Oh, should I turn the corner and, like, see if he's there?
[08:03.25]No, I got pills.
[08:04.43]I'll be alright.
[08:05.01]I'm done.
[08:05.31]I want to go down one more time before I use my magic.
[08:09.35]Oh, this is the better way.
[08:10.42]Good call, Boo.
[08:12.04]Wow.
[08:12.86]Spitter.
[08:13.32]No, it's not.
[08:13.72]It's just a hot hat guy.
[08:16.72]Yeah, they do look just like spitters.
[08:19.56]That one is a spitter.
[08:21.18]Oh, yeah, I know.
[08:21.80]It wasn't.
[08:22.04]Ammo's here.
[08:22.37]There's a hunter.
[08:25.67]Oh, ammo.
[08:25.97]I like ammo.
[08:28.41]Unload.
[08:30.81]He's dead.
[08:31.17]Oh, yeah.
[08:32.47]Right in here.
[08:32.93]Is there going to be a witch in here?
[08:34.79]That would be nasty.
[08:37.41]Pipe bombs, it looks like.
[08:38.82]Hey, no smoking.
[08:40.48]Let me guess.
[08:40.78]I'm gonna turn this corner.
[08:41.68]Boomer?
[08:41.96]Nope.
[08:42.34]Jockey.
[08:44.16]Oh, you had the same idea as me.
[08:46.16]How is he still alive?
[08:49.79]I hear a boomer.
[08:51.35]Alright, don't turn the corner.
[08:53.55]Are you kidding me?
[08:55.59]I hear a boomer.
[08:57.49]And I'm an idiot.
[08:59.39]I shot him.
[09:00.99]Turned around and point blank shot him like an idiot.
[09:06.57]I'm gonna... I wanna heal up.
[09:08.64]Actually, no, I'll save it when I go down.
[09:10.04]Yep.
[09:10.90]Alright.
[09:11.06]See, I'm gonna use it.
[09:15.32]Am I blocking your way right now?
[09:17.08]No, I didn't want to shoot that guy.
[09:18.82]He's got top right.
[09:20.12]Spit her.
[09:20.86]Nope.
[09:23.88]I will be using my... Oh, turn around shivs.
[09:26.88]Don't go on the ladder yet.
[09:27.94]Oh, somebody slurm.
[09:29.44]Slurm all over the ground.
[09:30.56]Slurm.
[09:32.92]See, that's gonna be the next Black Ops 2 killstreak is a brain slug.
[09:40.59]Or Hypnotoad.
[09:41.31]Oh my god, there's a lot of them up there.
[09:46.37]I'm going back down the ladder.
[09:47.47]This show has really went down after Season 5.
[09:51.25]Oh no, that's like unfortunate.
[09:53.31]What happened?
[09:54.09]Oh, I got you.
[09:55.85]I got a pipe bomb too.
[09:56.81]That's like a big Debbie Downer.
[09:58.99]I give no care.
[10:01.24]Alright, we're good.
[10:03.16]No problem at all.
[10:04.64]Throw a pipe bomb through the circle.
[10:07.30]I'm just gonna have a safe victory stroke.
[10:10.00]I'm gonna be a risky bastard.
[10:11.44]I'm fearless.
[10:12.30]I'll charge it, charge it, charge it.
[10:15.36]This can't end well.
[10:16.58]Oh, I got you, I got you.
[10:18.34]He's coming.
[10:19.86]Get off of him.
[10:21.14]Get off of my friend.
[10:23.70]And I just stole the med kit you were going after.
[10:26.22]Come here, boys.
[10:27.98]I'll give it to you when we get in here.
[10:29.53]That's alright.
[10:30.29]Ooh.
[10:30.65]I like the sound of that.
[10:34.29]Oh.
[10:34.61]Alright.
[10:37.89]Oh, yeah.
[10:38.07]Look at that.
[10:38.59]132 for Shibby.
[10:40.93]What's that KD up to now, Shibs?
[10:42.75]I didn't get my MOAB.
[10:43.62]I don't know.
[10:46.84]That was unfortunate.
[10:47.52]I think it's because you were using a killstreak.
[10:49.78]Oh yeah, I was using assault with my brain slug slurm combo.
[10:53.33]Alright, so who needs to heal up?
[10:56.73]Because I got a health pack I could use.
[10:58.51]No, I just healed and took one of the health packs.
[11:01.13]I have a health pack too.
[11:02.27]Wait, how come Lewis was just Lewis and not Boo for a minute?
[11:06.17]Oh, he was in spectator.
[11:07.35]Oh, okay.
[11:08.69]I'll take this.
[11:10.94]Actually, you know what?
[11:11.86]I can just use this and then take another one, right?
[11:14.15]Oh, sweet.
[11:14.73]I'm 16.
[11:16.11]Well, I could kind of do with another one.
[11:17.77]Oh, no.
[11:17.99]Yeah, take it.
[11:18.39]Take it.
[11:18.65]Hold on to this one.
[11:20.47]You keep that one.
[11:22.77]What are you doing?
[11:24.59]I protected you.
[11:26.11]That's really sweet of you.
[11:29.91]I kind of want like some Doritos from the vending machine.
[11:31.99]Hold on.
[11:32.21]What do they got here?
[11:34.37]Do you have any change?
[11:37.10]Scoot over.
[11:37.64]I want to like see what they have.
[11:39.08]They clearly have what is supposed to be Ritz crackers right there.
[11:41.68]That just says like crisp.
[11:44.74]And they have... No, they don't have any Doritos.
[11:47.79]They definitely pay the royalties to have those snacks within the game.
[11:51.43]Yeah, it only costs like $70,000 to have none.
[11:53.57]Worth it.
[11:53.83]Pixel's worth it.
[12:00.62]Let's go stealth.
[12:01.18]Stealth, what are you doing?
[12:03.18]Uh, getting some kills.
[12:06.28]What are you still currently doing?
[12:08.90]Oh, I was like looking around.
[12:12.34]Yeah, you were like walking around just like looking at stuff.
[12:14.66]This is a hospital.
[12:15.40]I just got done watching an episode of House.
[12:16.66]I want to see what this guy had.
[12:20.53]Alright, so where are we supposed to go?
[12:22.81]Yeah, I haven't played this campaign in a long time.
[12:25.47]Come to me.
[12:26.83]At least us.
[12:27.99]Let me just jog you through here.
[12:29.01]All the doors behind you.
[12:31.23]You really did just do that.
[12:37.40]Man, this is not the way.
[12:38.42]Okay.
[12:39.70]I'll jog you on it.
[12:40.76]Got him.
[12:41.02]Thanks.
[12:41.74]Sorry.
[12:42.58]Oh, it is this way, I think.
[12:44.71]Oh, it's either one of these ways.
[12:45.79]They can go up or down, I think.
[12:48.17]Alright, whatever.
[12:49.13]What's the best assault rifle?
[12:50.33]I want a Coke Zero.
[12:53.65]I'd say the ACR is pretty good.
[12:56.29]Type 95.
[12:58.86]Tanker, anyone have a MOLLE?
[13:00.00]You got a tank right now?
[13:02.04]Yeah.
[13:02.28]Oh, shit, I got hit by the rock.
[13:03.36]How does that happen?
[13:04.46]Oh, I'm screwed.
[13:05.62]Leave me.
[13:06.10]Just leave me.
[13:06.84]Done.
[13:09.48]This got smashed.
[13:10.74]Oh, shit.
[13:12.20]Alright, load that up.
[13:18.84]Reload, reload!
[13:21.74]Get that big bastard.
[13:25.30]Alright, he's hurting.

[13:29.97]Oh, Boo, did you hear that?
[13:31.43]I just got a text.
[13:33.43]No, I didn't hear him.
[13:34.35]Alright, he's down.
[13:35.09]Oh, nice, nice, nice job, Boo.
[13:39.21]Oh, we like won.
[13:40.07]At life.
[13:42.80]Um, I thought it was a spear.
[13:44.26]It's a bleeding plant.
[13:47.99]Look out, Spidda!
[13:48.85]Get that Spidda!
[13:51.69]Get that plant before it shoots its slurm.
[13:55.13]It's gonna float all over us.
[13:55.79]Let me close this door on you, Jeremiah.
[13:58.70]No, you can't get there.
[14:01.28]Alright, two can play at that game.
[14:03.10]Here you go.
[14:07.54]Ouch.
[14:09.12]I found her on the stairs.
[14:10.94]Absolutely.
[14:11.88]That guy's dead.
[14:15.02]Just closing doors in my face.
[14:17.72]I hate stairs.
[14:22.40]Alright, this is, uh... We're almost at the... We're both in here.
[14:27.44]Why are you closing us both in?
[14:29.36]There's an AK in this room.
[14:31.60]Ooh, is there?
[14:32.39]Is that a good one?
[14:35.37]Is it like, compared to the Type 95?
[14:37.10]How is it?
[14:37.66]I kinda want it.
[14:38.20]Is that over here?
[14:40.52]It's alright.
[14:42.24]Wait, so where's it at?
[14:43.80]It was in the... One of the rooms on the side on the left.
[14:46.46]It was hard to remember.
[14:48.36]Oh, look at that.
[14:48.98]Go.
[14:53.01]I need ammo.
[14:55.23]I wanna get that gun.
[14:57.21]There it is.
[14:58.81]AK!
[15:01.02]Spitter behind you guys.
[15:01.96]I just, like, slashed you.
[15:04.16]Slurm.
[15:06.57]Smash 12.
[15:07.91]Thank you.
[15:08.73]There is a spittin' bitch on a book.
[15:10.43]Put me down.
[15:13.51]Oh, sorry.
[15:14.91]I'm scared.
[15:16.31]There is a sloppy spitter bitch right in that corner.
[15:21.60]She's dead now.
[15:22.14]Alright, boys, let's roll.
[15:27.82]Yeah, the elevator's always fun.
[15:29.92]Oh, yeah, I forgot about the elevator part.
[15:31.48]This part is bad.
[15:34.99]I think it's quite relaxing.
[15:35.89]It's pretty nice.
[15:38.87]You guys ready to blow some heads away?
[15:41.65]You know it.
[15:42.79]Alright, I'm going to throw... No, I should save the molly.
[15:48.38]Eh, why not?
[15:50.24]Throwing it over there.
[15:53.46]Can't they, like, come through, like, both these walls, the ceiling?
[15:56.24]Yeah.
[15:56.62]They can break through.
[15:57.94]That's why I try to just hug the back wall.
[15:59.60]Oh, man.
[16:01.02]Oh, good.
[16:02.02]Now I feel safe.
[16:02.72]Now that you guys are vomiting on it, I'm fine.
[16:05.60]Yeah, well, you could just get smoked out of that room.
[16:11.12]Oh, left side, left side.
[16:12.38]And there goes that wall.
[16:14.58]That should be good.
[16:17.39]Nice.
[16:18.31]Oh, he's on me.
[16:18.77]T.Y., T.Y.
[16:19.91]T.Y.? ?
[16:26.30]Dead ammo.
[16:28.10]Where's this elevator at?
[16:30.12]Oh, is this tank music?
[16:33.08]Wait, no, it's not.
[16:33.80]Is it really?
[16:35.52]I'm down.
[16:36.00]Are you serious?
[16:36.70]There's no tank, is there?
[16:39.44]I thought I heard tank music.
[16:40.62]I don't... Might be mistaken.
[16:46.68]Just kill him.
[16:48.07]I'll shoot.
[16:49.33]I'll slurm.
[16:49.87]Watch out.
[16:50.37]Oh, no.
[16:50.81]Get out of here.
[16:51.59]Wow, that's all over us.
[16:54.71]Oh my god!
[16:55.53]Oh, and a jockey!
[16:56.25]No!
[16:56.49]Oh, I thought that was a good game right there.
[16:59.52]Wow, that was lucky.
[17:00.28]Nice job.
[17:02.24]That slurm covered the entire room.
[17:04.22]Yeah, that was a really good spit.
[17:06.36]Thanks.
[17:07.54]Oh, hey, the elevator's here.
[17:08.50]Oh, that's just okay.
[17:09.36]I'll get in it.
[17:12.76]Don't touch that button.
[17:13.56]We need our troops.
[17:14.54]I know, I'm trying to.
[17:15.33]It wouldn't let me.
[17:18.20]You can, like, call it and then get smoked out.
[17:21.37]Oh, God.
[17:21.97]Really?
[17:22.93]Yeah.
[17:23.61]There's, like, one really rare video on YouTube of that.
[17:26.21]It's funny.
[17:31.61]On the next bit, just run.
[17:33.77]Yeah, those of us that are... How many floors are there?
[17:38.09]Yeah, alright, jog lightly if you're injured.
[17:41.42]Stroll.
[17:41.80]Well, I was going to say, just leave me if I get hit by something.
[17:49.34]Did you just hear a hunter die?
[17:50.72]Or a smoker die?
[17:52.00]I heard something squish.
[17:53.52]Yeah, I think a smoker just fell from the top.
[17:56.44]We just, like, crushed him with the elevator.
[18:00.62]Yeah, what is that?
[18:01.30]What is that?
[18:02.12]We're, like, crushing things right now.
[18:04.86]Just run.
[18:05.38]I say my screen keeps jumping.
[18:08.76]Yeah, I know.
[18:09.18]There's a tank up here.
[18:10.24]I think that's what's going on.
[18:12.58]So, as long as one person gets in that room, that's all that matters.
[18:17.84]Yeah, because this isn't like the roof scene yet, right?
[18:20.50]Nope.
[18:20.78]No, next.
[18:21.36]There's one more.
[18:25.09]Oh, I'll take the tactical shot.
[18:28.03]Gibby.
[18:28.83]Coming.
[18:29.79]I'll wait for you.
[18:31.29]Weapons over here.
[18:32.83]Solely but surely.
[18:33.95]He would be like waiting at the door.
[18:35.27]Oh, I'm stuck with the help.
[18:37.12]Yeah, this isn't the way, I don't think.
[18:38.20]Wait, that's not the way.
[18:39.12]Oh my god.
[18:39.64]Get that hunter off me.
[18:40.80]Just shoot him.
[18:41.58]Punch.
[18:42.20]Oh.
[18:43.30]Oh my god.
[18:45.20]Everyone, we're coming.
[18:45.74]We're coming.
[18:47.79]Oh, Hunter's on me.
[18:48.87]Holy shit.
[18:49.91]Oh my god.
[18:50.51]We gotta get over there.
[18:52.33]I don't know the way.
[18:54.59]I think it's... Yeah, you're going the right way.
[18:56.53]Why'd you guys run ahead?
[18:58.63]We're good.
[18:58.97]We're good.
[18:59.77]You gotta take it fast on that thing.
[19:01.05]Let me grab my health kit that's on the ground.
[19:04.49]I'm taking those pills.
[19:05.33]Alright, we're good.
[19:09.87]Where are we going?
[19:11.81]To the room that's right there.
[19:12.85]Oh, wow.
[19:13.69]It really is right here.
[19:15.09]Holy shit.
[19:17.43]We did it, we did it.
[19:19.93]Why'd the door just open?
[19:22.08]Well, that's 74th, 74th.
[19:24.00]Come on, boo.
[19:25.12]Come on, boo.
[19:27.28]You all need to drop to, like, 73.
[19:28.98]That's, like, quick math.
[19:34.07]Wait, that'll give you 74.
