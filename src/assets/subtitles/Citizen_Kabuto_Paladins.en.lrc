[ve:60.16.100]

[00:02.85]Come on.
[00:04.33]Oh, shit.
[00:05.81]Please don't tell me.
[00:07.93]Did it work?
[00:08.31]I think you can see it, right?
[00:16.74]Come on.
[00:18.68]Alright.
[00:19.46]Alright, don't.
[00:19.98]Nobody move.
[00:21.20]Nobody move.
[00:22.04]It worked.
[00:23.62]No!
[00:29.01]No!
[00:30.35]No!
[00:31.23]What?
[00:31.49]What?
[00:35.67]Hold on it just fucking worked too.
[00:44.74]Oh my god.
[00:47.64]What a mess I'm gonna get this to work.
[00:55.84]I fucking promise
[01:07.11]Just bear with me.
[01:10.23]Bear with me.
[01:11.01]It will work.
[01:12.21]You know what?
[01:12.57]It's just going to be one of those nights where I'm not going to be able to see my other screen.
[01:16.12]I'm going to have to pray that my... Because it's... There's no way for me to tell you how fucking stupid this is.
[01:21.60]You just have to trust me.
[01:26.51]It was working too and then all of a sudden... I'm not turning the stream off again.
[01:36.85]I'll stream a 640x480 picture of my fucking asshole for all I care.
[01:41.85]I won't do that, but you know.
[01:44.77]Alright, let's try this one more time.
[01:46.29]Come on, game.
[01:47.17]Fucking please.
[01:49.83]I just want to stream this game.
[01:51.49]I just want to stream.
[01:54.05]Let me stream it.
[01:55.67]It looks like it was kind of fun.
[02:00.57]I can't touch anything.
[02:02.09]Once the game is open, I cannot touch a damn thing.
[02:06.58]That's what we're going to have to do.
[02:08.29]That's the only way around it.
[02:13.41]Here we go.
[02:19.27]Steam.
[02:21.97]Watch this game be like a piece of shit, too.
[02:24.43]It's not supposed to be.
[02:25.19]It's supposed to be fun.
[02:28.42]Alright, here we go.
[02:30.64]Pray to every god you've ever known.
[02:34.20]Can you see it?
[02:36.99]Can you guys- you can see it, right?
[02:39.41]I- I- I cannot alt tab.
[02:40.77]So, I'm so sorry, I cannot see a damn thing that's- I can read the chat, kind of.
[02:48.80]You can see it, right?
[02:53.94]Oh my god, thank the lord.
[02:58.63]I can't touch anything.
[02:59.55]Alright, here we go.
[03:01.03]Here we go.
[03:04.81]Nobody fucking breathe.
[03:08.31]I wish I could see who's subscribing, but I cannot move.
[03:15.76]Alright, so, uh, anyways.
[03:19.08]Of course, like, I test this for 20 minutes before I start my stream.
[03:24.93]Legit 20 straight minutes of making sure this will work.
[03:28.69]And turn on my live stream, all of a sudden a bunch of problems happen.
[03:31.65]Like, that's just gonna happen, right?
[03:33.31]Apparently.
[03:34.83]This cutscene might be loud.
[03:36.08]Let's go.
[03:44.05]Oh, it's locked.
[03:59.99]I would have laughed at that joke if I wasn't pissed off at the game.
[04:11.13]It's not too quiet, it's too loud.
[04:13.35]Are we like British cats?
[04:43.84]Alright.
[04:44.74]A boy called Timmy.
[04:47.84]I wish I could fucking alt tab.
[04:49.38]Alright, find the helpless little smarty boy.
[04:54.85]Hurry, he's in danger.
[04:55.65]Go, shoo.
[04:56.37]Kill all the rippers guarding him.
[04:57.83]Use the map if you need to find him.
[05:00.25]Beware of unfriendly people.
[05:02.25]That's why you have a handgun.
[05:03.19]Alright, where's the jump button?
[05:09.45]Alright, the tree's exploding.
[05:11.25]Good to know.
[05:13.49]Gotta get her to all of them.
[05:15.68]Use the map.
[05:18.80]What does that mean?
[05:23.02]We're just gonna go this way.
[05:25.24]Is this Mass Effect?
[05:26.26]Yeah, this is the original Mass Effect.
[05:35.29]No, you can't say next already.
[05:37.01]You can't say next already.
[05:38.61]It doesn't work like that.
[05:40.91]Are these the bad guys?
[05:46.46]This is like an RPG.
[05:47.60]It's supposed to be really fun.
[05:50.76]Give me the benefit of the doubt.
[05:55.69]The game has multiplayer.
[05:57.05]Does it actually work still?
[06:02.47]Oh, shit.
[06:02.83]Am I supposed to destroy the mounds, too?
[06:05.85]I guess so, yeah.
[06:13.77]Next?
[06:16.13]No.
[06:16.37]No, it doesn't work like that.
[06:18.19]You can't read this.
[06:19.15]I can read that one because it's right there, like in my breath roll.
[06:27.29]You guys can't say next already.
[06:30.25]At least give me the benefit of the doubt that I could try to play this game that took me like 25 minutes to get to work on stream.
[06:42.43]I don't think I even... Let's just go.
[06:43.65]I have to go find the smarty.
[06:47.85]Uh, okay.
[06:52.18]There's like a little town over here.
[06:58.42]Next.
[07:01.40]How do I jump?
[07:08.22]Wait, let me look at the controls for a second.
[07:09.60]Hold on.
[07:13.34]Special camera F. Q, tab.
[07:16.42]Where's the map?
[07:20.38]No sensitivity.
[07:21.74]Previous.
[07:26.15]Nice town.
[07:26.91]Yeah, it's a town, guys.
[07:30.89]Map mode C. Okay, so I gotta go there.
[07:36.07]Special camera.
[07:36.86]Alright, I like this game now.
[07:43.55]I need to make sure to use that.
[07:44.59]Alright, we gotta go this way.
[07:50.30]Okay, that was a big dragon.
[07:55.10]What the hell is that?
[07:58.44]Oh my god, that's from the Flintstones.
[08:01.69]That's the pterodactyl from the Flintstones.
[08:08.41]This is like freaking me out right now.
[08:19.11]I don't think I'm hitting him.
[08:25.33]They're making a lot of noise.
[08:30.11]See, you guys thought this game was gonna be bad.
[08:31.59]It's got like Fred Flintstone.
[08:34.07]What's that noise?
[08:37.65]I don't think I'm supposed to be doing this.
[08:40.86]Hey, I made it!
[08:41.82]Whoa!
[08:48.19]Oh, CRUNCHBERRIES!
[08:50.45]Oh, that hurt.
[08:52.26]Okay, that's health.
[09:03.84]Fred can't save this game.
[09:08.21]Destructible buildings?
[09:09.07]Are you kidding me?
[09:09.67]Look at this.
[09:13.09]Is my character 5'1"?
[09:14.83]No, he's... He's average height.
[09:20.52]I don't think I'm supposed to be here, but what is this place?
[09:24.06]Can I go in here?
[09:27.40]What the hell?
[09:28.80]Is this like a first-person mode?
[09:36.62]Fuck!
[09:36.94]I don't think I'm supposed to be here.
[09:40.04]I got off the road.
[09:43.86]Levolution.
[09:46.64]Alright, I gotta go this way.
[09:47.58]Let's go this way.
[09:52.22]What's the world record for this game?
[09:55.36]I'm already intrigued.
[09:56.72]We're not even, like, in the tutorial yet.
[10:06.13]Got him!
[10:09.01]Up here, over this way.
[10:12.55]I wish I... I'm so sorry, guys.
[10:14.03]I can't see.
[10:14.79]I can only see a portion of the chat.
[10:18.18]Somebody subscribe for three months.
[10:19.38]We have some bits in the ship.
[10:21.12]I'm so sorry.
[10:24.68]No, I could actually probably open it up on my phone.
[10:26.64]I'm gonna do that.
[10:27.16]I'm gonna have a second.
[10:27.92]Because if I alt-tab, it's over.
[10:32.46]Cutscene.
[10:35.53]Cutscene.
[10:43.05]Name's Buzz.
[10:44.51]Rightio.
[10:45.63]Mine's Ahmed.
[10:46.77]But you can call me Timmy.
[10:48.27]There's no way I was giving my new jetpack to that old ripper.
[10:51.10]Wait, what?
[10:54.40]You can have it, Mr. Bassel, if you want.
[10:56.76]And a lot of fun it was.
[10:57.88]I like this little alien.
[11:00.08]Carry me down this smarty mine shaft.
[11:01.98]The hatch is open now.
[11:06.01]I got a little friend now.
[11:06.67]I'll show you how to use my jetpack.
[11:10.43]Gosh.
[11:10.83]Fucking good shot.
[11:15.17]What am I doing?
[11:15.65]What the fuck was that?
[11:23.29]Didn't... Didn't we just go to... What the fuck was that?
[11:29.00]What the fuck was that?
[11:30.76]Oh, that was fun.
[11:31.42]That was fun.
[11:31.86]I gotta open up my phone.
[11:32.82]Is this too loud?
[11:36.18]I don't know if I can even change it.
[11:55.79]Anybody understand what's going on?
[11:56.96]Yeah, I'm going to open up my own stream and read the chat because I can't see it.
[12:02.76]Let's see.
[12:03.04]It's fine?
[12:04.00]Okay, that's good.
[12:28.48]Just making sure I can hear myself.
[12:31.12]I'm gonna turn that off.
[12:36.88]There we go, chat only.
[12:40.76]Oh, okay, I can read the chat now.
[12:45.36]My phone battery.
[12:46.52]Alright.
[12:47.86]Save four Smarties using your new sexy jetpack.
[12:51.28]Drop them off in the convenient location.
[12:52.50]Smartie pad!
[12:53.67]Watch out for hungry piranhas in the water.
[12:56.79]Right mouse button.
[13:00.20]Okay.
[13:00.92]So where are these Smarties over there?
[13:03.67]Let's go.
[13:08.83]You only have a certain amount of fuel.
[13:10.11]If I go in the water, I'm probably dead.
[13:18.22]Alright, I'm fine.
[13:22.53]Wait, not so fast.
[13:29.77]phone stream.
[13:33.05]I believe that's Rob Paulson, the voice actor.
[13:37.35]Uh, yeah, just keep going straight.
[13:43.66]Please, plus alt F4?
[13:46.88]No.
[13:48.90]I like, I like this.
[13:50.80]This is not, like, bad for me.
[13:52.67]I'm having fun.
[13:55.55]I'm entertaining you every day!
[13:58.71]Whoa, whoa, easy.
[14:02.27]Oh shit, I have to grab them.
[14:11.87]Shit!
[14:13.98]I gotta get on one of the rocks first.
[14:15.54]I don't think it's a jump, by the way.
[14:19.10]So where do I have to bring them?
[14:28.41]The smarty cave?
[14:30.99]Oh god, that one's dead.
[14:37.23]Can I pick up more than one at the same time?
[14:45.68]Okay, you can't kill them.
[14:47.34]I don't think I can have more than one.
[14:48.28]Oh, that's the smarty pen right there.
[14:57.45]Okay, that gun's gonna fall.
[14:58.67]I gotta go save that guy quick.
[15:03.29]No, stay up there.
[15:04.63]Don't fall.
[15:11.88]I got him.
[15:12.34]I got him.
[15:13.16]Don't worry.
[15:14.26]He almost died.
[15:17.90]Go, quick, hurry.
[15:18.82]I gotta save the other ones.
[15:20.24]Whoever thinks I'm a terrible video game player.
[15:30.19]Go.
[15:33.07]Cheers, love.
[15:34.61]Shit, he's gonna fall.
[15:36.91]Yeah.
[15:39.35]Get up on the rock, for the love of God!
[15:41.37]He's dead.
[15:47.14]Got him!
[15:53.44]License revoked.
[15:54.32]Oh shit, he's gonna fall.
[15:57.36]Deliver the weird alien people, quick!
[15:59.31]Please!
[16:04.37]Oh, they're respawning.
[16:16.71]They're pretty forgiving on that.
[16:19.59]I did it.
[16:20.43]No, look at the chat.
[16:21.59]I see a bunch of fucking pogchips.
[16:23.37]What?
[16:23.51]You've seen another guy like me?
[16:28.12]Certainly, Mr. Baz.
[16:29.32]He's over there.
[16:30.80]He crashed in
[16:40.06]Not the Joker.
[16:40.72]Brilliant!
[16:41.00]Alright, I gotta save my friend.
[16:42.16]Why is this playing?
[16:42.84]It's not playing.
[17:02.45]Alright.
[17:03.89]Rescue Tell from the crash to lander.
[17:05.95]He can't hold on much longer.
[17:07.15]Use a map if you need help to find him.
[17:09.34]Your new RPG has more firepower, but limited ammo.
[17:12.50]Aw heck, blow stuff up and worry about ammo later.
[17:14.52]Okay.
[17:18.06]So he's right there.
[17:19.74]Oh, hi.
[17:20.28]Is that one shot kill?
[17:27.73]Looks like it.
[17:29.43]How do I switch?
[17:34.34]There's gotta be a way I can switch my guns, right?
[17:36.10]One and two doesn't seem to be doing anything.
[17:42.49]I really am, like, turning into Pharah right now.
[17:48.29]What's the range on this thing?
[17:50.31]Hold on.
[17:51.89]Hey!
[17:52.59]Special.
[17:53.67]Special camera F, left shift, X, Q. Okay.
[18:02.38]It's really weird.
[18:04.04]This queue cycles weapons, I guess.
[18:06.97]There's no 1, 2, 3, and 4.
[18:08.37]Is that got range on it?
[18:16.71]Woo!
[18:18.78]Should probably just fly over there, right?
[18:28.04]Yeah.
[18:40.70]Oh shit!
[18:41.76]Oh shit!
[18:42.68]Oh shit, not into the piranhas.
[18:45.10]They're following me down here.
[18:46.02]Okay, give me the health.
[18:51.36]Oh no, can I even get back up there?
[18:57.26]Please?
[18:58.64]Please?
[18:59.14]Yes.
[19:06.41]Thank you for the sub, whoever that was.
[19:07.72]I really appreciate it.
[19:12.14]I'm so sorry that I can't see you.
[19:13.56]I keep trying to jump, there's no jump though.
[19:29.25]I'm dead.
[19:31.15]What?! !
[19:37.42]I'm just dead?
[19:42.14]What the fuck was that?
[19:44.18]What just happened?
[19:44.86]Alright, hold on.
[19:49.76]Drop it a tad.
[19:50.52]This game's very unforgiving.
[19:55.69]I gotta be real careful.
[20:03.04]I actually kind of like this game though.
[20:05.22]We're not moving on yet.
[20:06.74]We're staying on this.
[20:15.64]First person shooter mode.
[20:16.54]It's hard to hold E and move around at the same time.
[20:28.59]I'm going to clear everybody just because I'm scared.
[20:32.32]I don't want to get somebody creeping up behind me.
[20:36.64]At least we start back here.
[20:37.62]That's fine.
[20:47.79]Wait until he comes back up.
[20:48.97]I'm going to be safe.
[20:53.84]Call me a coward if you want.
[20:54.86]We're being safe.
[21:07.41]We're good.
[21:07.87]Arch health.
[21:10.27]Gonna come more of these fucking stinking aliens.
[21:12.26]I think I'm gonna change this one right quick.
[21:22.84]I don't think I like it very much.
[21:26.96]I want there to be, like, space.
[21:28.85]There's no jump in the game.
[21:29.73]Why not use it for what it should be used for, right?
[21:38.40]Alright, we made it.
[21:39.08]We made it.
[21:39.44]We made it further than we did before.
[21:53.43]Alright, we're safe.
[21:54.95]No, we're not.
[21:55.75]I almost just died again.
[21:57.19]These guys hurt for a lot.
[21:58.53]Holy God.
[22:03.08]Those aren't hitting him?
[22:03.94]The fuck?
[22:05.84]Does it have to be, like, right in their face?
[22:10.64]Are we going the right way?
[22:11.96]Yes.
[22:25.44]I have full health.
[22:26.22]Actually, there's ammo right here.
[22:27.82]Shoot him.
[22:30.26]Ammo, ammo.
[22:32.04]Alright, where is he?
[22:32.54]Is he hanging off the back?
[22:33.82]I feel like I'm watching the movies.
[22:42.21]Oh, hello there.
[22:42.69]My name's...
[22:51.15]Oh, dear.
[22:52.21]Sorry about that.
[22:53.05]I'll be over here if you need me.
[22:54.89]Easy, too.
[22:55.07]He's a friend.
[22:55.75]He's a friend.
[22:57.31]Come on.
[22:58.25]We need to find Reg.
[22:59.73]Oh, the Reapers will probably have him now, Mr. Baz.
[23:03.25]Oh, yes.
[23:03.98]Just yesterday, a Reaper squadron captured my whole village.
[23:07.40]I was only able to escape because of these old smarty mineshafts we've been traveling through.
[23:18.65]We could ask Daddy.
[23:19.91]He and Mother are the only smarties that didn't get taken.
[23:22.49]This guy's fucking creepy-ass face.
[23:26.96]But it isn't very easy to get there right now.
[23:28.66]Oh, great.
[23:30.18]Why?
[23:31.14]Thank you for the bits.
[23:33.02]Fuck!
[23:33.12]I wish I could see this.
[23:34.26]What?
[23:34.46]Are those guys carrying tubas?
[23:55.04]Mr. Basil, I'm 10 years old right now.
[23:59.05]He's 10?
[24:00.03]This is a little kid.
[24:02.65]There are smarty shops on each island.
[24:04.53]Just check your map.
[24:05.81]They'll give you more ammo.
[24:07.23]Plus, some even have new weapons.
[24:08.83]Right.
[24:09.95]Ready, tell?
[24:10.86]Ready, Baz.
[24:12.00]Ready, Mr. Baz.
[24:13.32]Wait, what?
[24:14.90]That was a lot of info.
[24:16.00]Okay, find the hatch that leads to the mineshaft.
[24:18.68]Use the map.
[24:20.06]To give orders to your mechs, hold down left control and press the following.
[24:24.41]Left mouse button commands them to attack.
[24:27.79]Right button... Go to.
[24:31.33]Pressing two orders, your mechs... Okay.
[24:37.51]Let's give it a try.
[24:39.38]So, left control.
[24:40.82]And you go that way.
[24:45.39]Ooh, this just got cool.
[24:46.35]Attack.
[24:55.08]Will he actually walk off the cliff?
[24:56.86]Yeah, he will.
[24:58.81]Now he flies right back to me.
[24:59.77]That's cool.
[25:02.09]Or does he?
[25:02.87]Come back over here.
[25:04.07]I probably shouldn't have done that.
[25:09.21]Come on.
[25:12.20]Come on, ship.
[25:14.33]Oh, what a great joke.
[25:15.21]Now I don't have a friend now.
[25:19.23]Just come over here.
[25:19.97]Come on.
[25:20.35]Will he teleport to me?
[25:24.17]Fuck.
[25:25.67]Fuck, come on.
[25:29.83]There he is.
[25:30.33]He's like a Jack in the Box.
[25:32.99]Get up here.
[25:33.59]Thank God.
[25:34.05]Alright, where are we going?
[25:36.38]We're going this way.
[25:41.20]Where'd he go?
[25:43.85]Hello?
[25:46.95]Where did he go?
[25:47.47]I think I lost him.
[25:52.72]Where the fuck did he go?
[25:53.52]Regroup!
[25:58.22]Regroup!
[26:03.04]That was funny.
[26:05.51]What?
[26:06.13]This guy is fucking freaking out.
[26:08.57]Just stop moving around so much.
[26:10.13]Get over here.
[26:12.61]This is cool.
[26:13.35]Alright.
[26:14.15]Let's go fight some stuff.
[26:15.99]What's wrong with my guy?
[26:16.88]Gonna make our way to the hatch.
[26:26.38]I gotta change these keybindings though, for sure.
[26:28.71]Yeah, give me a second.
[26:31.17]I want thrust to be... spacebar.
[26:37.82]No, I don't want that.
[26:39.04]There we go.
[26:41.10]Use weapon.
[26:42.16]Mouse.
[26:42.70]Nitro can be like... What's... E. E. I want this to be like... Mouse button 1.
[26:56.47]That's fine.
[27:00.25]Recall can be that.
[27:01.23]That's fine.
[27:01.99]Grenades.
[27:02.59]Let's see.
[27:03.05]Grenades.
[27:03.39]I don't want it to be G. I want it to be this.
[27:09.86]Rust is fine on spacebar.
[27:11.46]This is all fine.
[27:13.90]Zoom mode, we'll just do like middle mouse button.
[27:16.64]I wonder if I can, maybe can I not toggle it?
[27:20.73]We'll find that out.
[27:23.09]See if that's better.
[27:24.99]Yeah, that's much easier for me to do.
[27:27.47]Yeah, alright.
[27:29.61]Let's move!
[27:33.05]I actually kind of like this game.
[27:35.61]I'm not sick of it yet.
[27:39.43]Alright, go after him.
[27:40.03]Get him.
[27:44.05]Why is that guy so much better than me?
[27:46.81]He's got flying down so much better than I do.
[27:48.53]He's like a little bug.
[27:54.56]Are we going the right way?
[27:55.30]Yeah.
[28:00.68]Forget about him.
[28:01.14]Just come on.
[28:01.56]Let's go.
[28:04.18]Whoa!
[28:13.89]The game the game is pretty loud volume up, please I Mean I if it really is too soft.
[28:22.27]I'll put it up to be next stopping point.
[28:24.93]I'll figure it out Don't get hit don't get hit don't get hit don't get hit
[28:39.03]Don't get eaten by the piranhas.
[28:42.85]Ripper killed Baz.
[28:45.31]Tel killed that Ripper now.
[28:46.69]What is going on?
[28:49.79]Why is there combat text?
[28:52.47]Tel, I offed that Ripper for you.
[28:57.52]Are they just going to keep talking like that the whole time?
[29:02.86]How do I turn that off?
[29:13.26]What?
[29:14.72]Is he alive?
[29:15.26]Yeah, he's right there.
[29:17.00]Why does it keep saying that?
[29:23.60]Oh, we're close, right?
[29:24.34]Yeah, it's right there.
[29:28.96]Tell us your partner.
[29:29.72]Yeah, well, how come it keeps saying he's, like, getting killed?
[29:32.00]Alright, we're going in.
[29:33.87]Yeah, this game was made, like, 17 years ago.
[29:49.10]Sorry, I'm sorry I had to do that.
[29:51.56]Oh boy, okay.
[29:52.38]I'm gonna make it all the way down to the bottom right.
[29:56.32]Watch out for snipers.
[29:57.24]How do I tell where snipers are?
[29:59.33]Is that a sniper?
[30:20.70]No.
[30:20.86]It's just a bug.
[30:25.43]I don't see any snipers.
[30:30.15]Okay, I'm bad.
[30:31.85]I wish this guy wasn't on my back.
[30:40.74]He kind of weighs too much.
[30:46.08]Rippers.
[30:48.99]We've seen this enemy before.
[30:53.82]What is he shooting at?
[30:54.60]I'm not gonna use the rockets right now.
[31:02.95]Ripper killed, Baz.
[31:05.49]Good job, man.
[31:06.73]You're doing work.
[31:17.48]I guess there's like a ton of weapons in the game.
[31:19.44]This is really just like ADF from like 17 years ago.
[31:28.31]I don't want him to get credit for it.
[31:29.33]I have to get the kills.
[31:36.25]So, I'm going to try a really risky move here at the next save point.
[31:39.13]I'm going to... Oh, these are different.
[31:42.94]These guys are different.
[31:52.56]This guy's holding sniper rifles?
[31:53.68]I can't... Oh, he shot the tree.
[32:04.09]Shoot the feet.
[32:06.17]Ooh.
[32:07.05]Did he drop a gun?
[32:08.90]What is that?
[32:10.38]Oh, health syringe.
[32:21.36]Got it.
[32:23.98]Ooh, you like that shot?
[32:27.54]So I can heal.
[32:28.34]Okay, that's like a used item.
[32:29.90]I get it.
[32:32.14]Here's one of those smarty caves.
[32:36.37]Wait, what?
[32:37.49]Shop.
[32:37.95]Other shops.
[32:38.43]Health syringe.
[32:40.13]Health pool.
[32:40.61]Where's my money?
[32:41.65]Do I have money?
[32:47.33]What just happened?
[32:48.87]No.
[32:52.09]Shop weapons?
[32:56.89]Do I have currency?
[32:57.99]I don't think I do.
[33:01.32]Doesn't seem like I have money.
[33:05.46]Alright, hold on.
[33:06.00]I'm gonna... No, once we get to a save point, I'm gonna just alt-tab and try to just move this so I can really quick.
[33:11.66]And to make sure I can see the chat and everything.
[33:16.04]Oh, fuck.
[33:16.48]That guy's gonna snipe right.
[33:27.51]I thought he was still alive.
[33:31.61]You guys like an EDF?
[33:34.31]I am.
[33:36.44]We're gonna beat this entire fucking game.
[33:39.61]In the next two hours.
[33:40.31]No, don't say that.
[33:41.41]Is there actually, like, traveling time here?
[33:45.73]Or, like, headshots or something?
[33:47.73]Is it a grenade?
[33:50.65]Alright, uh, grenades.
[33:51.68]Let me just test it.
[33:53.74]Okay, that's how you throw a grenade.
[33:55.36]Those look terrible, by the way.
[34:03.17]Holy fuck.
[34:03.79]I'm dead No shit, how far is it gonna put me back?
[34:11.67]Oh my god.
[34:12.51]This is a hard.
[34:13.21]This is not Here we go three two one I'll tap quick Drop drop drop drop drop.
[34:20.78]I can see I can see I can see it crashed
[34:31.90]I hope it's saved.
[34:33.24]Please tell me it's saved.
[34:45.07]Motherfucker.
[34:47.39]Hold on.
[34:51.11]If I don't have a save right there, I'm gonna fucking throw up.
[34:54.53]I'm like enjoying this.
[34:56.35]I don't think I can run it in a window.
[35:01.16]Alright, we're gonna try this.
[35:02.52]I can see everything now.
[35:03.38]We're gonna open it and just pray that it fucking opens.
[35:05.60]3, 2, 1, open it.
[35:10.05]I can still see.
[35:11.33]Oh, fucking thank God I can see.
[35:13.01]Alright, Jerma.

[35:24.22]We're good.
[35:24.90]We're fine.
[35:28.78]It's gonna be in the same spot.
[35:29.80]Now we can actually see.
[35:30.66]Yeah, alright.

[36:08.77]Hey, Kvas, thanks for the five bucks Twitch highlights.
[36:11.25]Angry streamer destroys PC.

[36:28.53]Thank you, MortyRagey, for the 11 months.
[36:30.29]Throw up Cam or Riot.
[36:33.87]I need to... I'm gonna send him in.
[36:38.40]Smasher Rooney, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[36:40.20]Here's some money to wipe my butt with?
[36:44.86]What?
[36:47.56]Wipe my butt with it?
[36:49.34]I... I think I'll spend that money on...
[37:02.04]I gotta be careful.
[37:02.80]This game's not like a joke.
[37:04.98]So, I have to be actually careful.
[37:14.45]Yo, this is classic game Tuesday.
[37:16.51]What are you talking about?
[37:17.21]No, no, no.
[37:19.77]Sorry.
[37:19.99]Let me rephrase that.
[37:20.58]This is take us back Tuesday.
[37:25.98]A bunch of people are like, oh, wow, this game sucks.
[37:27.99]No, sorry, dude.
[37:28.93]This is fucking Take Us Back Tuesday.
[37:32.17]Where I take you back in time.
[37:35.75]Do you see that fucking super air shot?
[37:38.27]Walk shot?
[37:38.89]Yeah, check out that walk shot that I got right there.
[37:42.21]Take us back.
[37:43.63]Thank you, Spangaroo and Darkstar.
[37:47.17]Thank you guys for the two months and three months.
[37:48.65]And Lieutenant Campbell.
[37:49.63]I'm your favorite Bostonian little person.
[37:59.61]Come on, let me get another walk shot.
[38:01.37]Nice walk shot.
[38:02.95]Oh fuck, it's empty.
[38:11.84]Send your partner after the sniper.
[38:12.98]That's a good idea.
[38:14.06]Go get it.
[38:17.49]I'm assuming I'm gonna have like a handful of people.
[38:20.57]Yeah, we're gonna do this smart because I don't want to have to do this again.
[38:27.65]What the hell is going on?
[38:29.60]Are those bad guys?
[38:32.96]What am I going to bring back to scare Saturdays when Outlast 2 comes out?
[38:43.10]I want to just get new ammo for this.
[38:44.30]Alright.
[38:49.36]That should give me full ammo, I think.
[38:51.10]Yeah.
[38:52.54]That's really weird how that works.
[38:54.72]It doesn't cost any money.
[38:55.52]You just have to step on it.
[38:58.25]What about the healing syringe?
[38:59.36]I guess... Wait.
[39:00.62]Could I have gotten one?
[39:03.58]Actually, no, that's not true.
[39:07.24]Once Resident Evil 7 comes out.
[39:09.32]That's the new thing I'm going to be playing.
[39:14.45]This game looks kind of fun.
[39:15.51]It is kind of fun.
[39:18.26]For a game that's 17 years old, this actually holds up pretty well.
[39:20.88]And I knew it was like an old classic.
[39:24.06]Take us back on Tuesday.
[39:27.18]Go get that guy.
[39:28.82]Don't let him snipe me.
[39:30.38]Holy shit.
[39:37.44]Whoa!
[39:42.16]Alright, good.
[39:43.35]Go get the other one, too.
[39:44.07]He's down there.
[39:53.97]Come on, give me a walk shot.
[39:55.67]Walk shot.
[39:59.33]I gotta see PogChamps in the chat for that one.
[40:01.46]Fuck, no.
[40:02.00]No PogChamps.
[40:03.06]Fuck.
[40:04.90]Where's my partner?
[40:12.56]What happened to my partner?
[40:13.42]Is he dead?
[40:15.93]Did he get fucking frogchomp?
[40:18.05]Frogchamp?
[40:18.67]Frogchamp?
[40:21.81]Hide.
[40:30.01]Dead.
[40:31.95]I am so scared of getting headshot right now.
[40:33.97]Go get that guy up there.
[40:36.89]He's almost dead.
[40:37.98]Nice.
[40:38.20]Good work.
[40:38.88]We did it.
[40:40.06]What is that?
[40:41.28]I think it's a mine.
[40:58.91]Is there self-explosion damage?
[41:00.37]I'm not sure.
[41:01.69]How do I use mines?
[41:02.55]I think it was H or something.
[41:04.37]Alright, we're almost there, right?
[41:07.47]Yeah.
[41:08.87]Let's go.
[41:10.45]Am I even going to make the Presto Majesto emote?
[41:12.53]Soon.
[41:15.93]Hopefully I don't get snow wiped.
[41:18.51]Speaking of snipers, there's probably one here.
[41:27.11]This is where I gotta go, right?
[41:29.02]Sorcha Island.
[41:36.06]Alright.
[41:36.68]We did it.
[41:41.11]Thank you, Kasich, for the 1500 bits.
[41:44.31]Been super sick recently and wanted to say thank you for keeping me laughing through it.
[41:47.01]Well, hope you feel better, dude.
[41:49.31]My pleasure, sir.
[41:56.08]What the fuck?
[41:59.12]What is going on in this game?
[42:00.42]Sriracha Island.
[42:04.37]Go hunt down some scrumptious but not too bright vimps.
[42:07.87]Return 20 pieces of vimp meat to Timmy's father.
[42:23.89]Wow, you can put me on a fetch quest already, dude?
[42:29.67]Get him.
[42:31.71]Get... Get that guy.
[42:36.72]Oh, boy.
[42:37.20]Look at how far away this is.
[42:38.38]Uh, thank you also to Smasher Rooney for the 10 bucks.
[42:46.40]Jeremy, you nutball, here's some money.
[42:47.76]Oh, that guy told me to wipe my butt.
[42:50.28]Thanks, man.
[42:50.66]Thank you, Urosaur, for the sub.
[42:51.70]Kill a Crocomire for four months.
[42:54.66]Damn proud too for the months, by the way.
[42:56.86]Am I going to play Monster Hunter?
[42:59.08]I actually really was thinking about playing Monster Hunter the other day.
[43:05.24]Would you guys like watch a Monster Hunter stream?
[43:07.14]Would that be boring or would you actually want to watch it?
[43:09.82]I mean, we're currently on Get Us Back, Take Us Back Tuesday.
[43:18.79]That could be on Take Us Back Tuesday, couldn't it?
[43:27.05]Hell yeah.
[43:28.25]Maybe I will do it.
[43:30.83]I'll check that out.
[43:35.43]I'll give that a look.
[43:39.01]Where's my fucking friend?
[43:42.27]Don't I have another player here with me?
[43:49.85]What the fuck is he doing?
[43:51.05]Get over here!
[43:54.65]Just shooting at the ground.
[43:55.77]Get over here, man.
[43:56.49]We got vimp meat to get.
[43:57.81]This looks like an M&M's party game.
[44:04.55]Way cooler than M&M's.
[44:05.71]Oh, actually, no.
[44:06.27]Sorry, that's not true.
[44:09.39]Thank you, Kylo Ren, for the seven months.
[44:12.39]Welcome back, dude.
[44:16.01]Alright, they're down.
[44:18.45]Whoa.
[44:22.81]Taking out the shotgun for this one.
[44:29.64]A lot of health.
[44:34.36]Let's go.
[44:39.53]Played a bit before I stream it.
[44:40.51]The starting tutorial hunts aren't too exciting.
[44:44.37]Good to know, thanks.
[44:49.40]No, we gotta go down.
[44:52.35]Hey, I think we've found the vimps.
[44:56.13]This ain't gonna fit.
[44:56.85]What?
[44:57.07]Look at those things.
[45:01.47]Those things are awesome.
[45:06.17]Okay, I need to get a close look at these stupid, like, sheep enemies.
[45:11.06]Wow, these things are awesome.
[45:15.30]They're like paper mache fleas.
[45:20.18]Alright.
[45:25.35]Oh, they're getting away!
[45:26.21]They're getting away!
[45:27.67]Don't let them get away!
[45:33.34]Where the fuck do you think you're gonna go?
[45:35.30]You little flea shits.
[45:36.62]It's kinda gruesome, actually.
[45:44.06]How many do I need?
[45:49.99]This shit is dumb.
[45:50.83]Okay, I need to ask, like, for real.
[45:54.70]Is this shit way too loud?
[45:56.86]I'm looking at my screen, and it seriously looks like it is fucking blaring out people's eardrums.
[46:08.77]Everyone's gonna be mad that I turned it down, right?
[46:13.63]Alright, vent meat back to Timmy's dad.
[46:15.53]It's fine.
[46:16.83]Okay, I'll put it back there.
[46:17.67]That's where it was.
[46:18.21]It just looks like on my Twitch, my OBS, that it's like blaring.
[46:28.50]Wish I could fucking turn it down somehow.
[46:35.80]Fuck you, Trevor.
[46:37.44]Fuck you, dude.
[46:38.04]It was fine.
[46:39.43]Alright, let's go.
[46:39.85]Back this way.
[46:44.27]People are like, but me towards the game.
[46:46.65]Like, how am I?
[46:47.61]Am I too soft to the game?
[46:49.63]Wait, what?
[46:55.83]Can we make this jump?
[46:58.72]I'm going to go for it.
[47:01.46]Come on.
[47:02.36]Make the jump.
[47:07.09]You piece of shit.
[47:11.23]I will make this.
[47:17.02]Come on.
[47:17.78]God damn it.
[47:20.36]Fine.
[47:21.00]We'll go the real way.
[47:31.86]Jirmo, do you want money?
[47:35.62]I can get up there with a full charge.
[47:40.11]Do I want money?
[47:40.91]I don't care.
[47:43.95]Alright, good.
[47:52.81]I hope I can get up this way.
[47:54.11]Otherwise, this was a waste of time.
[48:00.18]Look at these jagged terrains.
[48:01.56]I love it.
[48:06.49]Beer.
[48:09.77]Alright, Timmy's dad.
[48:10.63]Here's your vent meat.
[48:12.17]Here's your World of Warcraft test.
[48:18.32]Hey, you got me some food.
[48:21.34]You made... Dinner at last.
[48:25.16]Wait, what's this?
[48:27.04]This...
[48:30.92]Thank you, Sweptie.
[48:32.18]Dead Saber.
[48:33.42]And Hideous Fascination for the subs.
[48:35.12]Thanks a lot, guys.
[48:35.96]Oh, I don't know.
[48:36.92]I can't think.
[48:37.68]I have these hunger pains.
[48:40.06]Me wife may have seen your maid, I don't know.
[48:57.76]What?
[48:58.06]Rescue the Smarty's wife, the man starving.
[49:00.64]Use the bush pack disguise to hide from Reaper guards.
[49:04.89]Note that you can't fly or attack while wearing your bush disguise.
[49:24.27]And that you can only wear it for a limited span of time.
[49:26.43]And it takes power from the jetpack.
[49:30.17]Watch out for SAM turrets.
[49:33.27]Which dissect frogs during science class.
[49:37.11]And hammer them with homing missiles.
[49:38.99]You can throw homing missiles off your trail by using flares found in the shop.
[49:45.98]Okay.
[49:48.16]How do I use the bush?
[49:52.63]I think I need to lift this up.
[49:56.77]Uh, left shift.
[49:59.25]I guess.
[50:02.20]Left shift.
[50:04.06]And then V as a flare.
[50:10.59]Alright, this is fucking dumb.
[50:11.89]Where do we go?
[50:14.49]All the way up there?
[50:15.43]Ugh!
[50:21.07]Alright, let's try to fly there as fast as we can.
[50:25.53]No.
[50:26.27]No!
[50:29.45]I need bloody dinner.
[50:32.03]Thanks a lot, WillSarcasm.
[50:33.44]No thoughts on money?
[50:34.36]What a sellout treatment.
[50:35.52]I know.
[50:38.64]Hey, look, if you want to give me money, I'll take it, but... Like, what... What would you... What are you going to do with that money?
[50:45.24]You could do something with that money, couldn't you?
[50:49.02]What is this?
[50:59.78]Okay.
[51:00.83]That was just a lag pillar.
[51:02.21]You destroy it, it makes your game lag.
[51:08.81]Am I enjoying this game right now?
[51:10.85]Yeah, I kind of am.
[51:14.36]Look at how far away that is.
[51:15.40]I can't.
[51:15.80]I better not die.
[51:19.14]It's just like a fun, old school kind of game.
[51:22.52]That just scared the shit out of me.
[51:23.68]I thought that was a bad guy.
[51:32.10]Hey, plus it has paper mache fleas.
[51:34.36]How could you go wrong?
[51:39.73]Oh no!
[51:40.95]Get back up, I was a joke.
[51:42.09]Go back and join the group.
[51:46.05]Fucking idiot.
[51:51.87]Left.
[51:52.77]Probably cut that off if I fly up there.
[51:54.73]What?
[51:54.97]Snipers.
[51:56.49]Wait, hold on.
[52:03.59]I can't see through our gumdrop disguise.
[52:13.48]Can this go in water?
[52:15.70]I guess.
[52:24.79]What?
[52:25.99]Oh, Jesus.
[52:29.13]I don't mind the fucking... Ah!
[52:30.89]Ah!
[52:31.71]Ah!
[52:39.01]Oh shit.
[52:39.91]Oh shit.
[52:40.29]Oh shit.
[52:40.59]Oh shit.
[52:40.83]Oh shit.
[52:41.07]Oh shit.
[52:41.31]Oh shit.
[52:41.51]Is this a shop?
[52:51.11]Found a shop.
[52:58.36]Go get him.
[53:01.20]He's still alive.
[53:01.72]He's right here.
[53:09.15]Do they know where the bush is?
[53:11.19]No, they don't.
[53:12.55]Where did he go?
[53:20.24]Right here!
[53:22.26]Stupid.
[53:25.32]What is that?
[53:28.54]That thing looks kind of scary, not gonna lie.
[53:33.55]Why is there a smarty shop here?
[53:35.07]I don't know.
[53:38.31]Why is there a smarty shop anywhere?
[53:41.09]Flare, we need a flare.
[53:43.80]Um... Health syringe doesn't seem like it makes any sense.
[53:48.26]I'll just replace all my weapons.
[53:54.10]Whoa, what's that thing?
[53:56.28]Machine gun.
[54:00.16]Can I use the health kit and then take another one?
[54:03.77]I'm just... I'm so curious.
[54:06.61]How do I use health?
[54:10.49]Give health is H. Activate back... Activate party house item.
[54:20.07]Disciple mode.
[54:20.59]There's a lot of... I thought it would be H. So what?
[54:25.09]X?
[54:27.45]X isn't doing it.
[54:28.47]H isn't really doing it either.
[54:30.95]How do I cycle through those?
[54:35.58]Should be working, right?
[54:38.20]I have full health.
[54:38.82]Yeah, but I mean, how do I choose?
[54:40.90]I guess those are just B, V. I guess you can't cycle them.
[54:44.57]They're just there.
[54:45.03]Alright, what is this thing?
[54:48.51]Cool.
[54:49.69]Let's get it full.
[54:53.88]Just a better version of that thing.
[54:54.94]Alright, let's go.
[54:57.08]Dermot, you're a loser.
[54:59.22]Why did you say that?
[55:05.18]This thing's gonna move.
[55:06.56]I can already tell, yeah.
[55:07.40]It's called a barracks.
[55:10.07]I'm waiting for this fucking Dark Souls boss to stand up and there be a health bar in the bottom of the screen.
[55:16.93]No, wait.
[55:18.77]Oh.
[55:20.55]It's like their home.
[55:22.16]This thing's actually pretty awesome.
[55:28.90]This thing's really awesome.
[55:40.54]Doesn't know what a barracks is.
[55:41.58]Well, I don't know.
[55:42.16]It could have been like some kind of French spelling.
[55:43.97]Like the rocks.
[55:47.19]Where?
[55:47.77]Whoa!
[55:49.31]What the fuck?
[55:50.87]Turn into a bush, quick!
[56:00.90]Oh shit, he's dead.
[56:08.74]Alright, here we go.
[56:10.26]He's back.
[56:10.70]It's okay, guys.
[56:11.48]He's back.
[56:15.96]Here we go.
[56:16.38]I used the health back.
[56:19.48]So this is what the bushes are for.
[56:24.28]Thank you, Pebbles, for the 10 bucks.
[56:29.87]Niko's your only friend.
[56:32.61]I'm gonna run out of juice, and these things are gonna see us.
[56:40.55]Alright, let's recharge right here.
[56:43.71]Recharge.
[56:46.85]Thank you, Mr. Peanut, for the four months.
[56:48.95]Regroup.
[56:51.91]Don't step out there.
[56:52.73]That would be really dumb.
[56:55.29]Alright, we're good.
[56:56.05]Charged up.
[56:56.51]Let's go.
[57:00.34]Didn't it say something about homing?
[57:03.08]Wait, it didn't say flares, right?
[57:04.28]What did it say about flares?
[57:07.64]Thank you, Relofello, for the sub.
[57:08.82]Welcome, dude.
[57:09.88]And also to the coldest fridge, thanks for four months.
[57:17.37]Can I take that thing out from back here with just, like, a rocket?
[57:19.51]Let's try it.
[57:26.51]Get rid of this.
[57:26.93]This thing's gonna be really annoying.
[57:28.01]Let's just kill it.
[57:28.53]For the love of God.
[57:32.35]Just, please.
[57:32.93]Please.
[57:35.30]Please.
[57:38.29]Alright, it can't see me.
[57:40.85]You don't actually... You be a distraction.
[57:49.35]Very good job being a great distraction.
[57:51.39]Alright, that's good.
[57:52.31]We got it.
[57:54.23]Nice work.
[57:56.09]Good work, dude.
[57:57.59]How far are we?
[57:58.95]About halfway.
[57:59.43]I'm scared it's going to happen again.
[58:08.79]Why did I take down the Gift of Flight video?
[58:11.29]Because I'm a fucking idiot.
[58:14.73]And I went on a mass deletion of videos a couple of years ago because I'm fucking stupid.
[58:22.02]Any more SAM sites?
[58:24.06]I don't know.
[58:24.48]Alright, we're going to just do like a... I'm going to come out of stealth and this guy's not going to know what hit him.
[58:33.08]But he dropped a Metal Gear Solid Ration.
[58:36.71]Oh, bullet ammo.
[58:37.39]Cool.
[58:39.37]This guy can't see us.
[58:40.59]They heard the noise.
[58:43.47]But they don't know us two bushes.
[58:49.81]Well, we were behind you, dude.
[58:51.81]Too bad you didn't know.
[58:53.65]Why would you delete videos?
[58:54.55]Because I was like deleting old shitty videos that were like old completely out of context videos.
[59:02.57]Stuff like
[59:04.34]Oh, hey guys, I'll be at PAX East tomorrow.
[59:08.10]It's like, no, that video makes no sense to be even around.
[59:12.08]Yeah, hey, like, I'll be... I just want to let you know that I'm streaming tomorrow.
[59:15.66]Like, stuff like that is just... They were like some full random Diablo 3 streams.
[59:22.02]They were just made no... They were just fucking terrible.
[59:23.68]They made no sense.
[59:24.26]You guys are fucking idiots.
[59:35.70]Whoa.
[59:36.86]What?
[59:38.90]I loved that video.
[59:42.72]Should have kept... But, like, I just... I went through and I checked a bunch of boxes and was like, oh, yeah, delete, yeah, oh, yeah, delete.
[59:48.84]I'm never doing that again.
[59:49.90]It was just stupid of me.
[59:50.70]And there's a lot of people here, so we're gonna try to pull them out one by one.
[59:53.64]Holy shit, there are a lot of people there.
[59:59.06]Um... Wait, how do I put down a mine?
[60:04.04]I'm gonna put a mine down here.
[60:05.98]What is it?
[60:06.49]Oh, B. Okay.
[60:07.23]Let's put a mine right here.
[60:17.38]I like frisbeed that right into that guy's teeth.
[60:20.62]And he doesn't even know we're here.
[60:21.88]Fuck.
[60:22.24]Alright, back it up.
[60:22.84]This way, this way, this way, this way.
[60:24.68]Stay back here.
[60:29.92]Fuck what are you doing?
[60:33.28]Is there something in this bush?
[60:35.40]I don't know there might be nope This is fucking dumb someone's gonna accidentally walk over that you go Wait wait wait wait wait this is gonna be funny come over here Wait, don't don't don't
[61:00.43]Where is this mo- WHAT?!

[61:09.80]This is fucking freaking me out.
[61:11.04]We're gonna lose our disguise.
[61:11.96]Alright, just fucking kill them.
[61:20.46]Go, go, go.
[61:21.06]Attack, attack, attack.
[61:25.73]Oh, this is not good.
[61:28.75]Too busy making shitty jokes.
[61:38.37]Alright, I'm fine.
[61:38.99]It's a health syringe.
[61:45.43]You guys really are not that smart, are you?
[61:49.01]They're just spawning and shit.
[61:50.17]I gotta get out of here.
[61:50.99]Fall back.
[61:51.43]Fall back.
[61:51.77]Get out.
[61:54.76]We need to sneak through this.
[61:57.10]There's absolutely no way that we're gonna be... There's too many.
[62:04.67]No, he's dead.
[62:06.29]No, he says I'm dead.
[62:08.32]No, that guy can see through.
[62:09.24]I'm just like throwing grenades out.
[62:25.29]Shit, that guy's gonna sniper.
[62:27.19]Oh god, I did this so wrong.
[62:30.53]I just gotta wait.
[62:38.99]Oh, I'm fucking gonna die here.
[62:40.25]I'm so dead.
[62:42.37]I did this so wrong.
[62:43.60]I was trying to make stupid fucking jokes.
[62:46.64]No, just go.
[62:47.24]Run away.
[62:49.82]Run away, run away, run away.
[62:53.10]Get some distance.
[62:53.74]I'll get this door.
[63:02.83]I could... What?
[63:03.83]Oh, I thought he disappeared.
[63:05.23]What?
[63:07.36]Mine.
[63:07.74]I need a health pack.
[63:11.85]Are they still coming over here?
[63:13.01]Fuck, I'm so screwed.
[63:21.80]What?
[63:23.56]Oh, God, no.
[63:27.06]Oh, my God.
[63:27.68]I have to replay the whole fucking mission.
[63:30.20]Oh!
[63:30.36]Oh!
[63:33.45]Oh my God, that was so... Okay, no more jokes.
[63:36.85]No more fucking around with the guys.
[63:38.05]Just sneak by them.
[63:39.43]Holy shit, what a disaster.
[63:40.75]That's so awful.
[63:46.49]Alright.
[63:47.81]Please make a note of that.
[63:50.03]Do not aggro.
[63:50.71]Just do the thing you're supposed to do.
[63:52.13]Don't be such a fucking dumbass.
[63:54.90]Next?
[63:55.34]No!
[63:55.70]No, not next.
[63:59.52]Actually next.
[64:00.26]No!
[64:02.06]We're not that far.
[64:02.88]We're so far away.
[64:07.62]We're so far away right now.
[64:11.46]I'm not done with this game.
[64:12.50]We're just going to speedrun it.
[64:14.33]I'll get there real quick.
[64:15.21]I promise.
[64:18.17]Is there a quick save?
[64:18.95]I don't think there is.
[64:19.69]Let's see.
[64:25.37]No, there's not.
[64:26.05]You just can't be bad.
[64:30.03]What would his next game even be?
[64:31.35]Um, like Fistful of Frags.
[64:34.61]Isaac.
[64:34.89]There's a couple things to play.
[64:37.07]We're not quite at that point yet, I don't think.
[64:38.86]Alright, no fucking around.
[64:45.30]We'll actually just... I want to get out of this area.
[64:56.86]Get him with the splash damage.
[64:58.90]Oh, you fucking dumb ants.
[65:00.44]They're not even ants.
[65:01.94]That guy dead?
[65:03.74]Yeah, he is.
[65:04.44]You can always tell when they're dead because they turn into maggots.
[65:11.15]Get out of the way.
[65:14.07]I don't want to hit you.
[65:17.43]Okay, there's a health pack there.
[65:18.43]I'm going to be fine.
[65:22.21]Yeah, there's like three other characters to play as.
[65:24.07]I'm not done with this game.
[65:27.73]I want to get out of this area.
[65:29.85]And get a new character, and... Just don't worry.
[65:32.56]Just don't fuck around.
[65:37.30]Replace all this stuff.
[65:39.46]Um... Mine's a fucking terrible.
[65:42.07]Just give me the flares.
[65:42.81]Alright, now somebody remind me what the flares do.
[65:46.39]Again.
[65:46.79]Because, like, I didn't pay attention again.
[65:55.02]through the barracks and we're going to replace our weapons again
[66:10.99]And we're back to where we were.
[66:12.49]I'm not taking my time to be like, Oh, what's that funny thing?
[66:16.60]Oh, watch this.
[66:17.50]Oh, the tree explodes.
[66:19.94]Funny, huh?
[66:21.08]What's this thing?
[66:21.58]An egg?
[66:22.00]Oh, it absorbs damage.
[66:24.26]Must have high health.
[66:26.64]I'm sorry.
[66:30.25]You know what I was going to say.
[66:31.79]Don't worry.
[66:33.09]Be easy.
[66:34.75]That was a... Alright, I'm going to get another one.
[66:36.95]Because I just fucked up.
[66:37.69]I hit V accidentally.
[66:39.61]What does that do?
[66:43.77]Okay.
[66:44.41]Well, let's go get flares again.
[66:45.41]Because I hit the button because I'm a dummy.
[66:48.57]Let's go.
[66:51.55]That's a rock.
[66:52.21]No, it's a fucking dinosaur egg.
[66:57.81]I actually do have to be careful because I really don't want to start this over again.
[67:00.43]Is this a new Unreal Tournament?
[67:04.07]No, it's Citizen Kabuto!
[67:06.09]Very old, but still slightly, slightly fun game that I'm not sick of playing yet.
[67:11.60]There's something about it that I'm enjoying.
[67:14.26]I don't know what that is, but it's definitely a thing.
[67:21.27]If I can only hit things.
[67:22.81]If I wasn't so bad that I missed every shot.
[67:25.89]Alright, here we go.

[68:08.06]This game's actually pretty good.
[68:13.76]Give it a chance.
[68:14.40]Oh, I'm absolutely... I'm having fun.
[68:18.00]I'm not gonna, like, switch games because, I mean, I'm having... Let's put it this way.
[68:21.34]Devil's Third...
[68:23.33]Like, I wanted to get the fuck out of that game, right?
[68:26.03]This is not a devil's third game.
[68:27.13]This is fun.
[68:27.57]But we need to be careful.
[68:29.33]No fucking around here.
[68:30.05]We're going to do some sneaking.
[68:32.99]I'm not going to make any jokes.
[68:34.81]We're just going to go.
[68:38.17]Because this is where I need to use it.
[68:41.47]Although I have to be very careful because... Can I kill this guy and not aggro the whole camp?
[68:48.00]I'm not even going to risk it.
[68:48.78]Just go.
[68:49.90]I've got plenty of time.
[68:50.50]There's a spot over here to the right where I can recharge.
[68:52.06]So we can do that.
[68:54.17]Play Devil's Dirt.
[68:55.65]Uh, guys.

[72:34.04]That's it.
[72:39.02]Okay.
[72:41.42]I think they're so stupid.
[72:43.18]You just don't shoot a gun.
[72:44.64]And you'll be fine.
[72:46.56]Yep.
[72:46.94]They're shooting the wall over there, I think.

[73:52.45]Yeah, we're safe now.
[73:53.12]Alright, why is this just the Mars Attack lady?

[78:05.97]Nitro E. Is it just on the... I'm kind of confused.

[82:52.53]This game's campaign is just a tutorial for multiplayer.
[82:54.81]Is it really?
[82:55.57]It's fun.
[82:58.34]I don't think anybody... Does anybody play multiplayer?
[83:08.11]I had it, too.
[83:08.93]I just got scared of the fucking bad guys.
[83:10.71]I'm gonna do that again.
[83:12.21]I just... I didn't know how many enemies were up there.
[83:14.79]I'm gonna do that one more time.
[83:17.63]Three, two, one, go.
[83:25.49]Next death equals next game?
[83:26.86]That's not how it works.
[83:28.74]Next death when I get sick of playing.
[83:32.02]No, next... No, next game... You know what I mean.
[83:44.59]There's one barracks down.
[83:51.70]I'm having fun.
[83:53.46]I'm just kind of chilling.
[83:54.20]There's three more barracks.
[83:59.34]Don't get hit by that.
[84:14.65]Barracks right there.
[84:15.71]Get it!
[84:15.93]Machine guns are much better than barracks.
[84:25.36]This really is EDF.
[84:28.90]I'm playing EDF with like a brainless partner.
[84:34.27]Just pretend... Alright, guys.
[84:35.31]Just pretend this is Star.
[84:37.19]Go get him, Star!
[84:41.01]Nice.
[84:48.08]Is that a health pool?
[84:48.88]I don't know.
[84:52.34]Over here.
[84:58.70]Where is it?
[85:01.32]I'm confused right now.
[85:04.86]Is that the nest I need to destroy?
[85:06.00]What is like still showing up on this mini map?
[85:11.36]It's like right here.
[85:19.57]It's not like the little holes in the ground, is it?
[85:21.68]No.
[85:22.50]Oh, it's right there.
[85:31.58]Two more.
[85:35.47]The ammo.
[85:42.69]How far away are these?
[85:43.88]Kind of far away.
[85:50.26]This game is stupid funny.
[85:52.50]It's kind of just fun to shoot things.
[85:53.74]EDF is hard.
[85:54.54]This game is just like shooting EDF bugs, but it's not hard.
[85:58.28]It's just fun and relaxing.
[86:02.54]Okay, I thought that was going to be like a place to land over here.
[86:05.68]Is he actually coming all the way over here?
[86:07.44]No.
[86:08.14]You are.
[86:09.24]Oh, fuck.
[86:10.12]That's not good.
[86:12.24]There it is.
[86:14.00]See if I can get it from all the way back here.
[86:15.78]That would be nice.
[86:21.31]Holy shit.
[86:21.83]There's a lot of people.
[86:25.80]Officially out of ammo.
[86:32.64]There's a lot... Oh, boy.
[86:35.08]Come on, die.
[86:42.87]Oh, that hurts.
[86:43.43]Remember when I said this game wasn't hard?
[86:48.83]Probably shouldn't have just said that.
[86:56.55]You gotta get in there, man.
[86:57.46]Go.
[87:14.43]Holy shit, there's so many people.
[87:17.57]Oh my lord.
[87:18.03]Run away.
[87:22.15]Wow.
[87:22.83]Whoa.
[87:23.73]Whoa.
[87:24.89]No, don't do that.
[87:25.43]Don't flare in the air.
[87:26.53]Whatever.
[87:26.83]Fuck it.
[87:36.02]Holy shit.
[87:36.98]This is fucking crazy.
[87:48.02]Oh fucking god dammit!
[87:50.63]I gotta get rid of that thing!
[87:53.89]It's almost dead.
[87:57.01]What have I done?
[87:58.49]What the fuck have I done?
[88:03.95]You stupid motherfucker, no!
[88:05.33]No!
[88:16.78]It's okay.
[88:17.22]Hey, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look, look.
[88:18.50]We're fine.
[88:18.74]We're fine.
[88:19.10]We're good.
[88:21.20]We're good.
[88:22.24]It's okay.
[88:24.20]It's like a good thing that just happened, by the way.
[88:26.34]Hey, we're good.
[88:34.12]We're fine.
[88:35.98]I got my ammo back.
[88:37.85]That was a little too intense to go in there.
[88:39.39]There's going to be like a hundred people there.
[88:42.37]Alright.
[88:42.89]Now this is safe.
[88:43.57]I can go up this way.
[88:46.06]Next.
[88:47.82]Not done.
[88:48.82]We are not done.
[88:51.26]Here's the skip right here.
[88:52.44]I couldn't do this before because there was too many of them.
[88:56.86]Now I can.
[88:57.79]We made it all the way back.
[88:58.99]Here we go.
[89:00.19]Just gotta go this way.
[89:00.95]Remember this?
[89:02.23]I do.
[89:06.53]And it's straight ahead.
[89:08.53]Machine gun's the best bet.
[89:10.11]There's a million people.
[89:11.31]Where is it?
[89:11.73]It's straight ahead in the back.
[89:22.62]Get over here.
[89:30.43]This game is good.
[89:31.25]It is.
[89:32.11]It is fairly good.
[89:33.75]Did I miss one?
[89:34.33]I don't remember coming all the way back here last time.
[89:44.13]Okay.
[89:48.83]Should I put on my stealth disguise?
[89:50.11]I'm going to.
[89:56.31]Is it all the way back here?
[89:59.83]Those guys can see through, but... Fuck it, just get out.
[90:15.14]Find it!
[90:16.52]Straight ahead, it should be right here.
[90:24.59]Uh...
[90:27.15]I didn't even do it.
[90:28.55]Why am I getting a cutscene?
[90:30.38]Okay.
[90:54.00]Lots of jobs that you have to do for these people.
[91:03.35]I don't want to do it.
[91:04.05]I don't want to do any more jobs.
[91:05.35]What a liar!
[91:24.24]Yes, new area.
[91:25.68]New place.
[91:26.36]Here we go.
[91:51.55]Told you there's gonna be a new zone Kill the Sonac.
[92:03.08]It's not like this is the first time you've had to detach Reg from some hairy beast The Sonac has a Sonic attack that can temporarily disable your jetpack, but it's got a great beat that you can dance to Grenades are a great way to say hello gun-toting stranger
[92:21.73]Oh boy, look at this place.
[92:22.89]Alright, let's go.
[92:26.47]Why is this named Citizen Kabuto?
[92:28.21]I have no idea.
[92:29.43]I don't have the slightest clue.
[92:34.96]Alright, ball's in.
[92:35.52]Let's go.
[92:42.03]Ball's in.
[92:44.73]Grenades.
[92:45.79]Got plenty of grenades.
[92:47.35]Probably need a lot of them.
[92:50.10]It's the same thing, but it's brown, not green.
[92:52.20]Hey!
[92:54.75]This game came out in, like, 1984.
[92:57.55]Come on.
[92:58.63]Give us some credit.
[93:09.43]High area?
[93:10.17]Okay.
[93:12.90]I'm gonna keep going.
[93:13.58]Screw it.
[93:13.86]Let's just go right to the area.
[93:14.88]Let's go.
[93:21.98]Uh, this is not the area, but let's close it up.
[93:27.06]Close enough.
[93:34.72]Come on.
[93:35.16]You can't pick them off like that.
[93:36.90]I'm sure I can.
[93:39.25]Oh, fuck me.
[93:40.19]Holy shit, that's a lot of people.
[93:45.37]Surprising, but good.
[93:50.69]I came out in 1984.
[93:51.83]Actually, 1985.
[93:53.37]Come on, man.
[93:57.25]He's going up this way.
[94:00.79]Um... Where the hell do I need to go?
[94:06.88]Looks like I gotta go this way.
[94:09.72]But there's nothing really over here.
[94:13.58]Oh, there it is.
[94:14.04]Okay, there it is.
[94:14.50]There's the enemy.
[94:15.22]Ow.
[94:15.80]Ow.
[94:18.17]Alright, grenades, right?
[94:19.97]I gotta kill the big Sonic beast.
[94:27.97]Where is he?
[94:31.04]Get over here before you fucking screw this all up.
[94:35.06]Where is he?
[94:39.82]Where is he?
[94:41.02]Can he see through the bush?
[94:41.84]I don't think he can.
[94:44.66]Alright, good.
[94:46.14]Gonna wait till he's in front of us and then we're gonna throw the grenades.
[94:50.46]3, 2, 1, grenades.
[94:57.07]Easy.
[94:58.09]Did it!
[94:59.21]Got another guy.
[95:14.32]I got two buddies now.
[95:20.95]Whoops!
[95:24.19]You guys didn't think we were gonna get more than one person?
[95:27.59]You shitting me?
[95:30.98]How does it feel to be old enough to be the father of some of your viewers?
[95:40.18]Down.
[95:44.01]I mean, I don't think I... Unless some of you guys are like... Seven.
[95:50.04]No, no.
[95:50.54]Unless some of you guys are like three.
[95:53.58]I can imagine me having a three-year-old son right now.
[95:59.79]So, I don't think there's very many people watching right now that are three.
[96:04.98]And here's why I say that.
[96:06.42]My brother and sister have children.
[96:08.82]And they're like one and two years old right now.
[96:12.46]So... Like... And they're older than me.
[96:15.53]So no, there's no way.
[96:16.67]Unless some of you guys are one.
[96:17.83]I gotta stop talking.
[96:20.13]Or I blow this.
[96:27.09]I don't care about that guy.
[96:28.01]Let's just speedrun it.
[96:35.06]There's like little baby rippers Somebody there they're both dead.
[96:44.01]It's fine.
[96:44.35]I don't care Hey, yeah, hello What no, okay good I hear you're quite the man about to
[97:06.22]If it weren't for you, Timmy would be fine now.
[97:12.90]So you better damn well get him back.
[97:15.70]Now, while you were gallivanting around saving this pathetic swine, Sappho's guard set up three new barracks.
[97:22.52]Here, take this sniper gun.
[97:24.88]Now go out and shoot them right between the eyes.
[97:29.10]Destroy all three Reaper guard barracks and kill the guards and use your schnoibeck.
[97:34.56]Mm-hmm.
[97:36.50]Cool.
[97:36.96]Did I just shoot it?
[97:38.85]How do I use it?
[97:44.77]What a piece of shit sniper.
[97:51.18]Oh, wow.
[97:51.68]What a great sniper rifle.
[97:54.64]It just increased my FOV.
[97:58.12]No, it decreased my FOV by, like, 40.
[98:00.44]That's what the sniper does.
[98:05.80]Drop my... Oh, cool.
[98:06.94]Sniper rifle.
[98:08.10]Awesome.
[98:08.64]Drop my FOV to like 30.
[98:09.84]That's it.
[98:14.28]And less than... Hold on.
[98:16.22]Zoom in.
[98:16.72]Z. Okay.
[98:21.19]Thanks.
[98:21.43]I was going to say.
[98:24.41]That would have been real dumb.
[98:28.71]Alright.
[98:28.91]Let's go do some snorkeling.
[98:31.81]Let's do some snorkeling.
[98:35.12]Hey, what's going on Sal?
[98:37.58]I jumped in the water.
[98:38.38]Whoops.
[98:41.86]Thank you, Salaam.
[98:43.55]Thank you, Salaam Tsunami, for three months.
[98:46.01]LolBears, thank you for five months.
[98:49.19]P.S.
[98:49.65]Next.
[98:51.73]And KG8011, thanks for nine months.
[98:54.01]It's been nine months, Jerma.
[98:55.01]Name our baby.
[98:56.97]Small and sweaty, just like his dad.
[99:02.76]Anthony.
[99:06.23]Don't ever snipe my eyes.
[99:07.79]Ow, ow, ow.
[99:10.91]That ain't that bad.
[99:11.77]Come on.
[99:16.55]What is this?
[99:17.15]Shield?
[99:22.34]I'm going to take the shield and see what it does.
[99:28.52]Something tells me that's going to be way more effective than being able to hide from one enemy type that's in the game.
[99:35.89]I'm gonna go this way.
[99:43.11]Thank you, Mazons, for the bits.
[99:44.41]Jerma was actually my middle school bully.
[99:46.13]He would stuff me in lockers, give me squirrelies, the works.
[99:49.13]Only as a grown man with a wife and kids of my own do I realize he was only doing it to toughen me up.
[99:54.44]Prepare me for the real world.
[99:55.70]For this, I'm eternally grateful.
[100:00.12]Um... Well, I didn't do that, but you're... I'm glad your life turned out alright.
[100:14.24]Let's climb this.
[100:17.22]Do a good sniping position.
[100:19.40]There's the barracks.
[100:20.76]And let's do some sniping.
[100:23.43]Go in there and make a distraction for me.
[100:29.29]There's one.
[100:31.43]Shit!
[100:33.15]Don't waste it.
[100:38.37]Don't waste it.
[100:44.07]What?!
[100:45.57]Oh my fucking god, no way!
[100:48.07]No way!
[100:55.71]That's such bullshit, it really is.
[100:57.67]That was fine, I had that perfectly fine.
[101:03.75]Ow.
[101:04.79]Sorry, there's another healing syringe, where was it?
[101:24.67]Where was that syringe?
[101:25.67]Did it disappear?
[101:28.76]Well, there's one.
[101:29.32]There's two more.
[101:30.78]One over there.
[101:32.02]Just range it.
[101:34.12]Whoa!
[101:38.24]Back and forth.
[101:38.90]They won't be able to get me.
[101:50.90]Oh, God.
[101:52.70]Oh, I'm so scared.
[101:53.66]I'm terrified right now.
[101:54.64]I gotta leave.
[101:55.88]Is that a shop?
[101:57.70]I think it is.
[101:58.12]Thank God.
[102:01.51]Oh, thank God.
[102:02.99]It is.
[102:16.35]Oops.
[102:16.91]It's gone.
[102:17.19]Alright, let's go.
[102:23.45]One pixel.
[102:25.95]Oh, well, two of them are dead.
[102:26.95]There's only one more.
[102:27.67]Alright, regroup.
[102:31.13]Where's my other guy?
[102:31.71]Is there two dead?
[102:39.17]Oh, this... Oh, that's so... It's right there, but fuck my eyes.
[102:43.49]I'm so sorry.
[102:46.07]We're just gonna cheese this shit out of him.
[102:48.27]Wait, I gotta hit this guy on the head.
[102:53.44]He's still alive?
[102:56.41]I shot that guy's head off twice.
[102:58.91]What am I doing?
[103:01.05]Why the hell did I do that?
[103:12.47]Got it, right?
[103:13.51]Got it.
[103:13.83]That's it.
[103:15.45]Is that it?
[103:15.77]That's not it.
[103:18.47]That's not it.
[103:22.51]Ow.
[103:26.26]What is left?
[103:34.46]Alright, there's that guy.
[103:35.59]Gonna heal just in case.
[103:37.43]And we're gonna take the machine gun, do the super boost, and get up there.
[104:03.63]I can't tell if that's blocking the damage or not.
[104:09.15]I win!
[104:12.27]Uh-oh, he blew the horn.
[104:24.76]What even is this game?
[104:27.16]It's an old third-person shooter.
[104:30.97]That I got requested to play it.
[104:33.65]And I kind of had my eye on it for like a little while.
[104:35.47]And it's kind of fun.
[104:37.96]Something different.
[104:44.38]Alright, we gotta kill everything.
[104:54.78]Seeing a theme with this game.
[104:56.36]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.
[104:57.18]Don't go down there.
[104:58.60]Nice, you blew our cover.
[104:59.38]Thanks a lot, buddy.
[105:19.96]Where did I go?
[105:21.36]What is happening?
[105:22.70]Stop!
[105:25.18]Okay.
[105:25.98]Well, we're down here now.
[105:30.26]Like, it's so... Okay.
[105:37.49]Holding middle mouse button down and then needing to click left click doesn't really work that well.
[105:44.19]At all.
[105:45.19]If I'm gonna be honest.
[105:54.83]I'm gonna die.
[105:56.48]That got really fucked up.
[106:01.30]Ooh, wasn't that a shot?
[106:05.48]Ooh, wasn't that a shot?
[106:08.06]Next.
[106:20.97]I'm going to strat with that thing.
[106:22.53]Three grenades.
[106:23.83]Done deal.
[106:25.79]I'm going to die.
[106:27.64]No, I'm not.
[106:28.18]Ha.
[106:28.40]I guess I thought I was dead.
[106:33.86]You guys thought I was dead.
[106:35.04]No.
[106:35.88]I'm very much alive.
[106:43.16]Sniper is back.
[106:45.40]Oh, they spread out.
[106:46.02]There's a lot of maggots over here.
[106:54.59]I don't get it.
[106:55.64]It says there's still a patrol here, but there's not.
[106:58.88]Will that go away when these maggots are gone?
[107:00.32]I don't know.
[107:02.34]Whatever, let's go.
[107:05.74]Next?
[107:08.38]No, I'm having fun.
[107:09.63]Another one dead.
[107:20.33]And the last one is all the way across here.
[107:21.80]That sucks.
[107:27.52]Somebody exploded.
[107:28.18]Oh, there's a guy over there.
[107:35.98]Watch this one.
[107:38.24]Wow!
[107:39.04]I got him!
[107:43.97]Ooh, he has healing.
[107:53.19]RIP Cod.
[107:55.10]Why are these still... Am I missing something here?
[107:56.78]Why is there still a marker on the ground?
[108:00.65]I have no clue.
[108:04.65]Why do they have to be so far away?
[108:05.77]That sucks.
[108:16.70]This game had a really cool multiplayer, but there's only a tiny community for a short time on GameSpy.
[108:20.42]Yeah, GameSpy closed down forever.
[108:22.98]That's unfortunate.
[108:27.49]It's like a fun little cheeky little game.
[108:31.55]I'm enjoying my time in it.
[108:33.41]It is fairly repetitive, but I just kind of want to see what's left.
[108:37.20]What's next?
[108:37.86]What else is in the game?
[108:40.88]It's keeping me interested enough where I don't want to stop playing necessarily.
[108:48.21]Here's the last one.
[108:49.09]Let's get a good snipe here.
[108:53.79]That's okay.
[108:54.17]He instantly exploded.
[109:01.69]Out of bullets.
[109:07.28]Whoa!
[109:08.32]Hold on.
[109:11.60]Wait a sec.
[109:18.50]I'm really glad I got to see what he does.
[109:25.01]The Opera Horse.
[109:30.65]That's gonna be it, right?
[109:35.67]I win.
[109:43.82]What's left?
[109:44.20]I feel like I'm missing something.
[109:54.47]Am I missing something?
[109:58.66]Is there one guy left I have to kill?
[110:01.68]I don't understand.
[110:19.68]What?
[110:19.82]I think...
[110:28.45]Huh?
[110:34.47]I think I'm missing something.
[110:42.50]Anybody understand what's going on here?
[110:45.82]Oh, there's a guy right there.
[110:47.36]Sorry.
[110:47.84]Alright, that's it.
[110:54.49]Got it.
[111:03.86]When am I getting to the first boss?
[111:04.86]I've been playing for like two hours.
[111:06.14]Now go in that fortress and kill three more groups of guards.
[111:15.61]You see that?
[111:17.09]Not bad for an old geezer, eh?
[111:20.63]You didn't do too bad yourselves.
[111:22.41]But listen, if you want to learn the ways of the smarty... We don't.
[111:28.95]Start with this.
[111:34.19]You just killed one of my guys.
[111:36.49]Oh, new gun.
[111:37.77]I said we don't, you old... How can it?
[111:41.70]This could come in handy.
[111:43.58]Good.
[111:44.50]Now we're ready for the guard bunker.
[111:47.83]There's the big bosses.
[111:48.67]Gotta take out more fucking reinforcements.
[111:51.09]I thought we were going to bloody...
[112:14.08]Alright, girl, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[112:15.60]Look out for the horn-wielding reaper guards.
[112:17.34]They will sound an alert.
[112:19.98]Use your rocket launcher to clear groups of enemies with just one shot.
[112:25.22]I can't, I don't, I can't pick it up.
[112:27.48]That's too many guns.
[112:30.08]How do I drop guns?
[112:33.33]How do I... Uh...
[112:42.87]Drop current weapon, J. Well, I don't want this anymore.
[112:45.43]Yeah, I'll get the machine guns better.
[112:51.32]Alright, well, let's do it.
[112:56.48]At least we have to go this way now, across the drop bridge.
[112:58.34]Let's go!
[112:58.76]Is that a bunker?
[113:05.31]Is that a bunker?
[113:16.89]I don't think so.
[113:17.35]I think I just wasted a shot.
[113:21.18]I very much wasted a shot on whatever the hell this is.
[113:26.00]Giant pork screw.
[113:26.72]That was so loud.
[113:33.85]I'm so sorry.
[113:36.27]That was useless.
[113:37.03]Alright, cool.
[113:38.49]Ooh, watch this one.
[113:46.75]Are you fucking serious?
[113:47.65]This thing sucks!
[113:55.78]What a piece of shit.
[113:58.42]This was supposed to be like a mega rocket launcher.
[114:03.13]It didn't do anything.
[114:17.12]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[114:26.92]Ooh!
[114:28.06]Nice.
[114:31.06]Nice.
[114:31.74]Very nice.
[114:43.05]What am I going to get out of up here?
[114:44.65]Got it.
[114:47.90]Somebody's... Oh, that guy.
[114:50.26]Don't fall!
[114:51.08]I fell.
[114:51.62]Fucking come on.
[114:52.72]No!
[114:55.22]Oh, what a... Next.
[114:58.10]Yeah, now you can say next.
[115:01.27]No, not yet.
[115:01.71]Don't say it yet.
[115:02.95]Don't say it yet.
[115:04.25]Fuck, come on.
[115:08.37]There's another Dracula up there.
[115:22.96]Stay.
[115:23.48]Next.
[115:23.92]Stay.
[115:25.20]There are three other characters in this game, you know.
[115:29.53]Oh god, there's like dragon eggs.
[115:30.69]I don't even know what's shooting at us.
[115:34.75]Something is.
[115:35.13]What the fuck?
[115:44.66]Jesus.
[115:45.16]Okay, let's go.
[115:45.78]I didn't even get up to the guard post yet.
[115:48.60]I'm not even there and I'm screwed.
[115:57.83]Again, I keep hearing noises.
[115:59.13]Somebody is launch- Oh, it's you!
[116:02.85]Is he dead?
[116:08.09]He better be.
[116:15.96]Stay, stay, stay.
[116:19.02]Yeah, we're gonna stay.
[116:25.20]Oh, shit.
[116:28.01]Do I have to destroy those?
[116:29.21]I think I have to destroy that.
[116:36.63]No, I didn't.
[116:37.31]It's okay.
[116:39.45]We're learning things together, guys.
[116:42.17]Snipers?
[116:44.23]Snipers?
[116:48.03]There's one right there.
[116:49.14]No, whatever.
[116:50.80]Just kill that guy.
[116:53.18]What the fuck?
[116:54.42]How did that guy get behind us?
[116:56.52]How did you guys let that happen?
[117:03.09]Just go.
[117:03.47]Just get in there.
[117:04.11]Please.
[117:07.63]Get in there.
[117:10.85]I need a health kit.
[117:11.67]Bad.
[117:15.41]Please have a health kit on you.
[117:16.52]No, you don't.
[117:19.42]Where are you?
[117:19.98]Ah, fuck.
[117:25.48]They're being spawned from somewhere too, aren't they?
[117:30.27]They have to be.
[117:36.63]I missed.
[117:37.97]No, I didn't.
[117:40.55]Kill the bunker!
[117:45.03]There's so many, dude!
[117:46.04]Come on!
[117:46.86]How much health does it have?
[117:47.88]Oh, fuck!
[117:59.81]Oh, for the love of God, no!
[118:10.22]Dude, take my super homing missile.
[118:11.78]It does fucking nothing, by the way.
[118:16.68]Check out my homing missile.
[118:18.56]Oh, by the way, it doesn't hurt things.
[118:21.51]It sucks.
[118:22.25]I'd rather keep this thing.
[118:25.95]Next, next, next.
[118:26.97]Alright, we do one more try, and then we do next.
[118:31.88]Stay.
[118:33.62]Thank you, Seasaurus, for the eight months.
[118:35.24]Welcome back.
[118:37.12]The Master Toaster, thank you for four months.
[118:38.64]AntojoP for 13 months in a row.
[118:41.94]Thanks a lot, dude.
[118:44.48]And KG8011, I think I got you already, but thanks, man. ...
[119:03.39]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[119:05.01]Oh, he's a good guy.
[119:11.16]Slowly but surely, and there's a guy... A whole patrol coming over here.
[119:16.36]Ah, for the love of shit.
[119:19.56]I gotta be good about this.
[119:20.58]Two shots?
[119:21.10]No, it's not gonna work.
[119:22.86]I... Oh my god, what the fuck am I thinking?
[119:26.44]There's fucking mines everywhere.
[119:39.22]Shit This is over already It's over before it even started Unless I can be a psychopath Kinda be a psycho Fuck it, we're just doing it Going in hot
[120:32.86]Fuck.
[120:34.90]Well, the game's fun.
[120:36.56]I like this game.
[120:38.13]But we're gonna change.
[120:46.43]Stay, stay, stay.
[120:49.05]It opens up a lot later.
[120:50.17]I mean, I could still.
[120:51.45]But I just hate the fact that if you lose... If you lose, it puts you at the very beginning.
[120:59.16]Cute, goofy yell.
[121:02.26]Multiplayer.
[121:02.84]I don't think anybody plays it anymore.
[121:09.07]Follow New Vegas.
[121:10.29]Play multiplayer with bots.
[121:13.01]Let me hold on a second.
[121:13.63]Let me see.
[121:13.99]Let me just take wild, wild guess here.
[121:17.82]It's going to crash probably, but let me see something.
[121:21.76]Give me one second.
[121:23.92]Tea break.
[121:24.32]I want to see something.
[121:25.16]We're going to move to a Fistful of Frags if this doesn't work.
[121:30.58]But give me one second, guys.
[121:33.76]I want to see if I can load up multiplayer with bots and just see what it is.
[121:37.95]See how it works.
[121:39.17]Well, okay.
[121:40.09]Game crashed.
[121:40.75]Good.
[121:41.39]Cool.
[121:44.69]Give me a second.
[121:47.51]There you go.
[121:51.52]Let's just see.
[121:52.64]Hmm.
[122:00.90]I have no idea what any of this means.
[122:12.90]Uh...
[122:25.84]Game type.
[122:27.34]Team deathmatch.
[122:31.34]Capture the smarty!
[122:37.45]I'm not sure I can add bots.
[122:45.97]Presto majesto, it works.
[122:55.14]Hmm.
[123:00.24]Maybe it will give me bots.
[123:01.10]Let's just see what happens.
[123:08.77]I'm curious now.
[123:10.63]Play a Bugs Life for PS1?
[123:12.11]Alright.
[123:21.74]I'm on Team Blue.
[123:31.55]Let's play the game by ourselves.
[123:37.36]Having a beach party?
[123:39.90]Check out Armed and Dangerous.
[123:42.22]I've actually heard about that game before.
[123:46.14]I could.
[123:47.98]Paladins might not be installed, but I could install it real quick.
[123:50.32]Let's just see what this is.
[123:51.60]I'm curious.
[123:54.27]Alright, me.
[123:55.15]This is my area.
[123:56.13]Okay.
[124:02.45]This is where the enemy is, I think.
[124:07.95]Tom and Jerry, War of the Whiskers.
[124:09.60]There's no other players here.
[124:20.84]I could play Isaac.
[124:21.54]I could do whatever.
[124:22.04]I'm down for whatever.
[124:23.32]I did want to play this for a couple hours, though.
[124:24.89]I was just curious how it was.
[124:27.03]And it actually is fairly fun.
[124:29.64]Are these bad guys?
[124:39.28]I feel like I shouldn't be killing... Oh, okay.
[124:42.08]I don't think I was supposed to kill them, but... There's no other teams here.
[124:45.67]There's no reason for me to... These are the only things I can fight.
[124:54.64]Play Paladins with Star.
[124:56.08]Let's see.
[124:56.68]Is he still streaming?
[124:57.34]Alright, let's do that.
[124:59.52]If I even have Paladins still installed.
[125:01.32]It might take a minute.
[125:02.22]I'll take a tea break.
[125:08.84]Give me one second.
[125:09.66]I'm going to just see.
[125:10.54]Let's see if it's installed or not.
[125:14.55]I thought it was installed.
[125:21.41]Paladins, huh?
[125:24.50]I don't think it'll take very long.
[125:30.76]No, it'll take like fucking two or three minutes.
[125:39.84]Yeah, we could do that for an hour or two.
[125:49.30]Paladins, yeah.
[125:50.66]Well, if he's around, if he's still playing.
[125:56.86]Isaac is fun to play.
[125:57.50]Paladins is fun for everyone.
[125:58.53]Yeah, whatever.
[126:01.93]I'm game for anything for the next couple hours.
[126:06.51]Unprepared streamer.
[126:07.95]I didn't think I was going to play Paladins, but if Star wants to play, I'll definitely play with him.
[126:16.96]Paladins is already installed.
[126:18.14]What the fuck are you talking about?
[126:24.70]Huh?
[126:25.84]Paladin's not already installed.
[126:27.28]What are you saying, man?
[126:33.90]Um, what?
[126:38.69]That's not true.
[126:39.41]Attack of the Suns.
[126:53.82]I have to open this thing.
[126:57.48]There we go.
[127:02.14]Oh, that's why.
[127:02.96]It's on Steam.
[127:04.34]Okay, I get it.
[127:06.70]I got it.
[127:06.96]It's on Steam.
[127:14.42]It's already installed, too.
[127:18.47]Would you look at that?
[127:21.48]How do I get in contact with Star?
[127:23.06]Just like send him messages.
[127:25.96]Spam him.
[127:37.51]Log in.
[127:38.69]Hey, there we are.
[127:39.39]Alright, let's move over to this.
[127:44.03]Put game capture on Paladins and I'll change my stream title to Paladins.
[127:48.81]And maybe Star will play with us at some point.
[127:54.73]Sam, five bucks.
[127:55.47]I would honestly love to see you try to remake classic movies in the movies.
[127:59.71]We're going to do a movie stream soon.
[128:02.05]I just didn't want it to get to a point where it was the same shit over and over again.
[128:06.37]I'd like to give it some time in between.
[128:07.61]And let's open up.
[128:14.57]Let's go to TeamSpeak.
[128:17.49]Let's see if we can track down.
[128:18.51]I wonder if Vitalik is around too.
[128:19.98]He might probably want to do this.
[128:22.50]He actually might want to do this.
[128:27.96]Oh, well, they're like here.
[128:31.39]Hi, guys.
[128:33.11]Oh.
[128:33.29]Hi.
[128:34.49]I see you're playing Paladins.
[128:36.09]Yeah.
[128:37.11]You got room for one more?
[128:38.97]You're not even good at this game, dude.
[128:40.39]Yes, I am.
[128:40.97]I already have to carry a golden boy.
[128:44.63]Name one character from this game, Dermot.
[128:46.31]Skye, I win.
[128:48.80]You're watching him play, Skye.
[128:51.00]I played this game a lot.
[128:52.50]He's played it with me before.
[128:53.60]I wasn't serious.
[128:57.00]You're going to play with him?
[128:59.68]I'm streaming, too.
[129:00.22]We're both streamer boys.
[129:01.00]Alright.
[129:03.30]I mean, I've just been streaming all day and kind of wanted to stop soon and go take my wife to dinner, but... No, don't.
[129:08.62]I mean, I just saw you playing and I was like, yeah, you know what?
[129:11.06]I just wanted to play Fistful of Fries with you the other day.
[129:13.30]How about you play with Jerma so I can get out of it?
[129:17.00]Jerma, play with me.
[129:17.90]So I can get out?
[129:19.32]Jerma, play with me.
[129:20.66]I'm loading it.
[129:21.10]I'm loading it.
[129:21.45]I just want to point out I'm a way better friend than you are.
[129:24.77]Oh, thank God.
[129:26.17]Wait, easy anti-cheat.
[129:28.44]What?
[129:28.97]This is new?
[129:29.41]Okay, that was weird.
[129:33.73]I need to change my screen title.
[129:45.40]Alright, Paladins, are you gonna load or what?
[129:48.74]I'm sorry, people are still giving me way more money.
[129:51.64]Oh yeah, I saw that.
[129:53.06]You got like $6,000 in like 10 minutes.
[129:57.54]Oh my god.
[130:00.22]Lucifer, that's just the Jerma versus Star message.
[130:04.04]We can't be on opposite teams.
[130:05.31]Don't you know that these new FPS games don't allow you to play against your friends?
[130:10.29]Can't we just join a party?
[130:12.11]Yeah, but I mean like you can't be on the other team, so there's no Jerma versus Star.
[130:16.03]What are you saying?
[130:17.29]Just invite me whenever.
[130:22.99]Well, we are going to compare their stats, right?
[130:27.37]Hmm, why is it not showing up?
[130:30.13]Oh yeah, Jeremy, you're going to have some stats compared.
[130:33.21]That's fine.
[130:33.81]Did you have trouble capturing this game?
[130:35.27]For some reason, OBS doesn't want to capture it.
[130:36.91]Oh, yep.
[130:38.01]You can't do that.
[130:38.91]What?
[130:41.21]You can't capture an OBS.
[130:42.43]You would have to get OBS Studio to do it.
[130:44.13]Are you serious?
[130:44.69]Which is actually something you should do anyway, but it'll take you too long to settle.
[130:47.70]Well, I'm just going to capture my screen.
[130:49.18]Who cares?
[130:51.44]Have fun with that.
[130:53.84]Easy.
[130:55.12]How about to tag in the chat?
[130:58.62]Tag?
[130:58.94]Just capture the monitor who gives a shit.
[131:00.38]They're gonna say, oh my god, this is so embarrassing.
[131:01.52]Are we gonna have a full boy group?
[131:04.02]This is really embarrassing.
[131:06.18]I'm not changing it.
[131:07.24]You guys are gonna see my desktop background.
[131:11.20]What is it?
[131:15.41]It's Kylo Ren from Star Wars.
[131:18.17]Bill?
[131:22.37]What a toddler.
[131:24.01]Well, this is like the old... Remember I bet you I was going to keep this forever?
[131:26.51]Yeah.
[131:28.38]And you kept it.
[131:29.44]I did.
[131:31.18]Let me open up this over here.
[131:32.76]We're going to have a full men group.
[131:37.08]I think we are.
[131:37.50]For some reason this is closed.
[131:43.55]I don't know why.
[131:45.89]You know, like, when you go to Walmart and the first rack you see of little boys clothes always has, like, a bunch of, like, really cheap Star Wars... We're gonna have a full men group.
[131:55.21]That's like Jordan's wardrobe.
[131:58.36]Dude, I love Star Wars clothes.
[131:59.80]Come on, it's a great series.
[132:04.64]It's a really good series.
[132:06.18]How many Star Wars shirts do you have?
[132:08.64]Eight.
[132:10.03]Maybe nine.
[132:11.13]Like, your Star Wars shirts are to my...
[132:14.66]a whole Overwatch wardrobe.
[132:20.04]Alright, I guess whenever you're ready, I'll take an invite.
[132:24.78]Are you in a game right now?
[132:26.55]Yeah.
[132:30.15]What do you think you have left on it?
[132:31.17]It's a new hero.
[132:32.77]It's very close to being over.
[132:33.85]There's a fucking million new heroes since the last time you and I played.
[132:38.34]I played with Etalyx, like,
[132:41.01]month ago maybe like three weeks ago oh really yeah we played I've seen all these people except for this one through all these development cycles and sky is still like this stupid uh actually was this guy in the game I don't think this guy was in the game this guy might be new too
[133:09.22]Yeah, I guess I didn't even unlock this one or this one.
[133:14.83]Champions!
[133:15.83]Do I like this game?
[133:16.57]Yeah, it's good.
[133:18.59]What do you think about this game, Jeremiah?
[133:19.93]What do you think about this game?
[133:21.23]What do you think about this map?
[133:23.42]I like it.
[133:24.50]What do you think about the stat check afterwards where everyone gets to see how much better Ster is?
[133:30.46]Well, that's fine.
[133:31.02]We can sit here all day and you can do that.
[133:36.15]What happened to us being nice to each other?
[133:37.93]Wow.
[133:38.61]Goldenboy just left.
[133:40.53]I guess he's like, you're just killing all my friends off.
[133:44.07]Remember when you were nice to me and I was nice to you for the last couple weeks?
[133:46.99]What happened there?
[133:50.03]You haven't talked to me.
[133:52.07]I have.
[133:56.12]I have.
[133:58.52]Where are you?
[134:00.20]MLC Stealth is playing this right now.
[134:05.00]to my friends uh do you want to invite me um did tag actually want to play because I didn't see anything in chat I just saw people saying random people's names that I should play with tag did say something in chat it sounded excited but he didn't say anything after that tag we get a tag in the game I should probably say that I changed from citizen kabuto
[134:37.02]Oh, everyone knows Big Earl.
[134:39.06]That's fine.
[134:40.00]People knew that.
[134:40.46]That's out of the bag on Big Earl.
[134:42.91]I streamed Smite a couple times.
[134:44.07]People knew Big Earl.
[134:44.77]I think I should accept all these friend requests, everyone.
[134:49.13]What are you talking about?
[134:54.84]I definitely want him.
[134:57.58]Is tag here?
[134:58.54]I don't know.
[135:05.46]I'm queuing us.
[135:06.99]You know the whole card thing now?
[135:08.21]You've done that?
[135:10.09]Sort of.
[135:11.77]Has it changed from like a month ago?
[135:13.84]Maybe.
[135:15.20]I don't know.
[135:17.02]I mean, you like make the loadout for each character?
[135:19.46]Yeah.
[135:19.68]Alright.
[135:30.07]I actually probably should go into my controls.
[135:34.13]Keybindings.
[135:38.30]Oh, we're going to play with Long Dick Larry.
[135:41.80]The legend himself.
[135:47.38]Oh, shit.
[135:47.78]Actually, when does Mexican Place close?
[135:49.64]It probably closes at like 10 p.m.
[135:50.70]Yeah, because Boston sucks.
[135:55.61]B-T.
[135:58.83]Jump.
[135:59.21]Okay.
[136:03.63]Let's do it.
[136:09.14]Thank you, Hawk Shy.
[136:10.06]I was looking at my chat this whole time, Tag.
[136:13.38]Magpie, thanks for the 500 bits.
[136:14.66]Check out Revelations.
[136:15.52]Shit, you're right.
[136:16.04]It does close at 10.
[136:16.68]It's one of those games.
[136:17.90]Well, thanks, dude.
[136:18.84]Well, that's out of the... That's not going to happen.
[136:22.03]Who do I want to play as?
[136:23.43]I don't want to get you Burger King.
[136:25.19]I don't want Burger King.
[136:28.33]I might be this crazy guy.
[136:43.67]Yeah, I'll be Andross.
[136:46.41]If I remember what this guy does.
[136:48.45]Oh, God.
[136:51.11]What?
[136:54.34]What?
[136:57.52]I feel like he's one of those characters you might need to be, like, okay at games to play.
[137:02.46]I've played him, like, two or three times and done well.
[137:05.73]Two or three times and you're still level one on that character.
[137:08.44]Whatever.
[137:09.32]Yeah, okay.
[137:10.22]That's, that's, that's looking good right now, guys, here.
[137:13.68]Everyone in my chat, yeah, Jarrah sucks.
[137:15.86]It's not okay, Jarrah.
[137:18.43]See, you got a stick up your ass already.
[137:19.89]That's great.
[137:20.69]Yeah.
[137:21.21]You're real fun to play with.
[137:23.31]Why did you want to play with me then?
[137:24.73]I don't know.
[137:27.71]You don't know.
[137:28.99]Because it looked like fun.
[137:32.47]That's like the reversal thing.
[137:34.07]What else is this?
[137:36.33]That's the... I had the same amount of viewers he has.
[137:40.13]So, sorry.
[137:40.67]Me and Star had the same amount of viewers today.
[137:42.47]So, sorry.
[137:52.41]Wait, you streamed already today?
[137:53.73]Yeah, for like two hours.
[137:55.35]What'd you play?
[137:56.21]Citizen Kabuto.
[137:56.83]You didn't hear me just say that?
[137:58.35]Oh, so you streamed for like two hours and you're done.
[138:00.77]I'm still streaming!
[138:01.67]I see how it is.
[138:04.13]See, people in my chat know that you're fucking irritating.
[138:10.85]People in Jerma's chat know that these two hour long streams aren't good enough.
[138:17.76]I wasn't playing.
[138:18.32]I'm still going.
[138:19.40]What are you talking about?
[138:25.35]I gotta remember how to play.
[138:37.02]This is a new map, I think, right?
[138:38.22]I don't know.
[138:41.75]You keep asking me what's new.
[138:42.97]Like, I haven't played this game.
[138:57.66]Aw, they also think you're irritating, Steve.
[139:01.78]No, that's what we were talking about, is that I'm irritating.
[139:06.64]Oh, yeah, my friends do.
[139:07.86]Yeah, they know.
[139:09.40]They know better than Jermis does.
[139:12.48]Alright, so now it's a contest to be more irritating.
[139:20.32]Woo!
[139:20.82]Look, can we just enjoy the game?
[139:25.35]Not about the game.
[139:28.03]winning we are winning who's winning we are the gods oh my god you got me killed
[139:49.72]Jerma was the one by the way that was like hey don't invite tag He sent me like a private message was like I don't like I was screaming the whole time.
[139:57.13]Nobody saw me write that No, yeah, cuz you brought it like private and like in speed people can't see that Shit what do you think this is?
[140:20.38]Uh, what do I have?
[140:20.90]Let me see.
[140:21.44]They added these, like, weird things, right?
[140:25.19]Yeah, they added these weird things.
[140:30.55]If I get more damage as you as a support Jerma... This will keep us safe.
[140:34.39]You'll be fine.
[140:35.11]Don't worry.
[140:36.27]This is casual paladins.
[140:37.86]Like, be stressed out.
[140:39.72]Next.
[140:39.88]Next.
[140:54.30]I think I don't even know what this guy's ultimate is.
[141:01.77]How do I look at abilities?
[141:03.15]Okay, there we go.
[141:05.01]Okay.
[141:06.33]It's just high noon, duh.
[141:08.69]Sorry.
[141:09.33]Am I grumpy?
[141:11.71]What does my ult do?
[141:18.27]Ever since Jorma got here, you've just... I don't know.
[141:21.43]You really need to calm down.
[141:27.27]I don't understand her teleports sometimes.
[141:28.95]Why all the way back here?
[141:30.67]It doesn't make any sense.
[141:33.06]Like, just got rude.
[141:33.92]We're not acting like we do with my fanfiction.
[141:40.54]I can't buy anything.
[142:01.74]Thanks for the healing.
[142:04.22]Thanks for the healing!
[142:06.18]I gotta play Grover?
[142:11.64]Okay!
[142:12.62]Shit!
[142:13.52]Okay!
[142:31.64]Mmm, hold on.
[142:39.16]An Amarick teleport by Sleptard.
[142:41.10]I thought it was always... the furthest allusion.
[142:45.22]I haven't played her very much.
[142:46.68]How do you get on the mount?
[142:53.36]What's the mount up?
[142:54.22]You don't.
[142:54.85]Oh, oh, oh.
[142:55.41]I thought we were like...
[143:03.11]Level 2 Humanoid, thanks for the 11 months, dude.
[143:04.58]Welcome back.
[143:05.70]Fapple Dapple, thanks for 2 months.
[143:07.20]RHC, thanks for the sub.
[143:09.58]Vroom vroom vroom.
[143:15.03]Dude, look inside my mirror.
[143:31.39]Look in my mirror.
[143:33.95]What's in the mirror?
[143:35.47]Ow.
[143:43.77]Just look inside my mirror.
[143:45.85]I'm gonna come look in my mirror.
[143:56.78]Come on guys, support me when I'm looking in my mask.
[144:02.57]What are you saying?
[144:05.61]He's having a stroke.
[144:07.11]Yeah, I need to stop playing.
[144:08.55]That's what I'm saying.
[144:10.12]Like, you came on and it's just like, oh, hey, I streamed for one hour and it's time to play.
[144:14.18]I was so done.
[144:16.00]That was like my last game.
[144:17.28]Are you so void of real content that you just have to make fun of me every single chance you get?
[144:22.08]No, I'm just fucking, I want to be done.
[144:24.22]Are you just so void of interesting things to say that you have to make fun of me?
[144:28.13]I'm playing Paladins.
[144:29.77]This is the most boring stream I've ever played.
[144:35.04]This is NOT the most boring stream we've ever had, oh my god.
[144:37.80]What was the other one?
[144:38.72]It was a really bad one recently.
[144:41.18]Like every rats one you've ever done?
[144:43.24]Oh my god, those were... pretty bad.
[144:45.80]Like you can't say you had a boring stream if you used two rats.
[144:53.25]Yeah.
[144:56.53]But some people like that game.
[145:00.17]I think you planted them, I think they're fake.
[145:02.31]Like all the people that donated it.
[145:14.64]So true And I just found out that I'm not allowed to eat Oh
[145:44.17]Do we still have like 50 cereal bars?
[145:48.42]They're disgusting.
[145:50.42]Can I throw them out?
[145:52.21]No.
[145:53.71]What?
[145:54.01]They don't go bad.
[145:55.47]But if they're disgusting and I'll never eat them.
[145:58.13]They're there.
[145:58.67]I've eaten a couple of them.
[146:00.53]Why throw them out?
[146:01.43]There's nothing.
[146:02.19]There's no reason to throw them out.
[146:04.25]Jerma, talk some sense into her.
[146:05.59]They're on my mind, Steven.
[146:06.87]What are you throwing out?
[146:07.77]I'm not throwing out.
[146:08.95]I have a box full of bars.
[146:10.21]Disgusting.
[146:11.79]They're Golden Graham bars.
[146:13.51]They're kind of good sometimes.
[146:15.55]No.
[146:16.35]They don't go bad.
[146:19.39]So why would you throw them out, Jerma?
[146:21.65]The last time I had one, I had to go to the pharmacy at 1 AM, Steve.
[146:25.15]I... What?
[146:30.45]I'll eat them when the time's ready.
[146:32.04]Hey, what do you want to eat?
[146:37.60]Like, food.
[146:38.42]If you were Steve, what would you eat?
[146:51.76]He's in game mode.
[146:53.50]Me?
[146:53.86]Oh, sorry.
[146:55.70]I would probably save them.
[146:59.59]I would save them.
[147:00.43]You'd save what?
[147:03.07]I would probably save them.
[147:04.22]If they don't go bad, is somebody going to eat them?
[147:06.31]That wasn't the question!
[147:07.35]We have, Jeremy, we have a lot of cabinet space.
[147:10.09]We have a lot of places to put these.
[147:11.33]No we don't.
[147:11.97]We actually don't.
[147:14.35]Yeah we do.
[147:16.13]You are a tall guy, you think we have all these cabinets but we don't because you're tall and you can reach.
[147:21.44]Well then let me put them up into one of the cabinets like a tiny person can't use.
[147:25.80]And then you'll never even know that they're there.
[147:27.28]I will though, because you just told me.
[147:30.51]This guy's doing Vag in the chat.
[147:32.83]What?
[147:34.73]We gotta get Tag in here, man.
[147:37.95]We've been in the game.
[147:39.23]Yeah, but after this.
[147:41.87]We need Tag.
[147:44.22]We do need Tag.
[147:45.18]Tag would fix everything.
[147:46.24]He would agree that I should roll off those hero bars.
[147:52.14]Dammit.
[148:03.40]All the tiny people know what I'm talking about.
[148:09.72]I don't know what you're talking about.
[148:11.52]Yeah, you're not tiny.
[148:12.77]I'm a big, well-developed, vascular, hairy man.
[148:16.19]What is going on right now?
[148:20.31]Missed out on some stream.
[148:22.59]Disagree.
[148:25.70]Hairy, vascular man.
[148:27.76]You've jumped on a trampoline with Steve.
[148:29.28]You know it's true.
[148:31.77]I mean, he is pretty... You know, he's alright.
[148:35.88]He's alright.
[148:37.04]I'm either confirming or denying.
[148:44.18]I was just saying, he doesn't have the Mumble.
[148:51.94]Woo!
[148:53.62]Man, you can't catch me.
[149:00.56]Get that payload.
[149:02.68]Get that Eevee.
[149:04.08]Kill her.
[149:05.00]Kill her dead.
[149:07.36]That was just what I needed.
[149:15.45]Thank you for cleaning that up.
[149:17.63]Hey, no problem, buddy.
[149:21.59]I can't use that.
[149:26.49]What happened to us being nice to each other over the last couple of weeks?
[149:29.92]That was on you.
[149:31.28]What happened to that email?
[149:33.26]I sent it again.
[149:36.18]You still haven't gotten that email?
[149:37.94]No.
[149:38.94]Why?
[149:42.42]I wish I could explain how that's possible.
[149:50.73]Because I did it the first day and then I did it like seven hours ago.
[149:55.75]Make sure I have the right email.
[150:01.69]Nice job!
[150:02.17]Nice job!
[150:02.73]Yeah!
[150:02.99]Yeah!
[150:03.89]Oh, I actually have team speed.
[150:05.97]Thank you, Major.
[150:06.53]For the bits.
[150:07.81]I'll send you the info tag because you're talking in my chat where I expected you to type and I see it.
[150:12.15]And I, like, visually see it and I'm a good streamer and I read my chat all the time and I react to what's in it all the time.
[150:16.78]Karma and Star email scandals.
[150:18.34]Uh-oh.
[150:20.92]Email?
[150:21.22]What year is it?
[150:32.46]It's all about the Twitter scandal now.
[150:36.14]Oh, best support.
[150:37.16]Good job.
[150:39.42]49 million healing.
[150:41.48]How do I, like, say, good job, man?
[150:47.14]I don't know.
[150:57.16]But alt-tabbing this, like, ruins this game for me.
[151:03.42]Are you gonna get a good friend tag in here?
[151:07.57]Yeah.
[151:09.23]Yeah.
[151:10.87]Sir is a tall brisk 5'10 while Jerma is sadly a small 5'8.
[151:19.61]That's the average.
[151:22.91]I clearly said thousand.
[151:31.63]It's Tig!
[151:33.07]I hope it's you and not like a... The stream is flickering?
[151:36.35]An imposter.
[151:37.45]The stream's flickering?
[151:38.11]I have no idea how to use this program.
[151:40.39]Nice.
[151:41.85]Is there actually like video problems?
[151:43.85]Me capturing my monitor?
[151:44.83]We heard you, so you figured half of it out.
[151:46.55]Alright, I need to set up a hotkey.
[151:50.05]Yeah.
[151:51.31]Push to talk.
[151:52.97]The game's been going well, I see, huh?
[151:55.96]Yeah.
[151:57.36]You declined my party invite, thanks.
[151:59.81]I'm trying to make him push the dog?
[152:01.17]Alright, give me another.
[152:03.76]Oh, never mind, I accepted it.
[152:04.82]Wait, it is flickering?
[152:05.84]What?
[152:06.30]Are you, like, in a fish tank, Teg?
[152:09.16]Uh, oh, is it, it's probably using my wrong microphone.
[152:11.48]How often does it happen, is it happening a lot?
[152:13.56]Is it annoying?
[152:14.22]I'm gonna try to fix it.
[152:15.70]It's kind of annoying.
[152:16.34]How do I?
[152:17.26]It's okay, he's never streamed before.
[152:18.62]There's just a lot of background noise.
[152:21.92]Oh, then it's probably my furnace.
[152:23.06]I'm gonna try something else here.
[152:25.68]Are you in the basement?
[152:28.99]My stream room is in the furnace room.
[152:33.43]Creepy.
[152:34.69]I don't know who I am.
[152:35.87]Who's that guy?
[152:36.53]I don't know who this is.
[152:42.07]Got him.
[152:49.28]Will this work?
[152:53.30]Imagine a world where I actually wanted to decline every friend request.
[152:56.10]Like, who made this world?
[152:59.34]Nice on Steam because there's ignore all.
[153:02.12]Yeah, in this game there's just screw you.
[153:04.44]Your friends, your actual friends appear at the bottom of the list.
[153:07.74]Let me know if that helps, guys.
[153:10.46]I don't know you.
[153:12.68]I don't know you.
[153:14.40]I don't know you.
[153:17.00]Are we ready to rock and roll?
[153:18.60]We're in a queue for a minute.
[153:19.82]Can you please get off my back?
[153:22.00]Wait, what?
[153:22.90]How is this not working?
[153:29.67]Dude, I need food so bad I'm gonna die.
[153:31.83]Ty, what would you do right now?
[153:33.95]Would you go to Chipotle?
[153:35.23]Uh, I'd just order food.
[153:36.23]You'd order- you would order Chipotle.
[153:41.01]Oh yeah, oh yeah.
[153:42.83]That should- Oh, that's weird.
[153:43.83]What if I'm not, like, a disgusting person?
[153:45.99]When was the last time you were a bird?
[153:46.93]Sorry, guys.
[153:47.51]I'm trying to fix the, uh, flicker.
[153:49.35]Did I- did it fix it?
[153:51.95]Days ago.
[153:52.39]Hopefully that worked.
[153:53.79]I apologize.
[153:54.68]Yeah, it's a good day to have another one.
[153:56.12]Order one.
[153:58.21]Haven't seen any flickering?
[153:59.03]Okay, that's good.
[154:01.01]Good, good, good, good, good.
[154:08.45]I can't use Bomb King, unfortunately.
[154:11.67]How do I set up my...
[154:17.54]Jerma, what's your opinion on how many people do you personally know that could do a better Bomb King voice?
[154:23.96]Bomb King!
[154:27.72]Is it that bad?
[154:30.16]Isn't it?
[154:30.88]I mean, all I hear him go is, Bomb King!
[154:33.16]And it's like, yeah, the freeware distortion they put on top of high-res... Hey, the game's in beta, alright?
[154:40.25]Give him some slack, alright?
[154:41.65]Oh, it's flickering again!
[154:43.31]Fuck!
[154:43.85]Select your champion.
[154:46.73]I can fill.
[154:49.14]Better.
[154:50.38]I'll play Pip.
[154:57.32]So, does that happen in the game when I'm playing, or is that only on, like, menus and HUDs?
[155:00.15]I'm getting Saturns in here now.
[155:01.77]What the fuck?
[155:02.77]How can this game not be captured?
[155:06.09]Kyzic?
[155:06.65]Wow.
[155:07.17]Being really sexist.
[155:11.31]Still trying to figure out how to get this working.
[155:13.23]It's worse now?
[155:13.85]What the fuck?
[155:17.35]Dude, Paul7 didn't pick a character.
[155:19.35]Let's queue for 10 more minutes.
[155:24.03]Paul7.
[155:24.65]It's only in the menus?
[155:31.16]Okay.
[155:32.10]I'm so sorry, guys.
[155:32.98]That's fucking annoying.
[155:35.14]There it is.
[155:38.20]I got it.
[155:38.76]I got it.
[155:39.24]Push to talk setup.
[155:40.24]I got it, boys.
[155:43.13]How's life been, Tagg?
[155:47.71]How the game's been, guys?
[155:49.11]Pretty good.
[155:53.90]Yeah, alright.
[155:56.00]No, I've been working through a year backlog of videos, just sorting through them, because that's what happens when you stream daily and never leave yourself time to edit videos.
[156:09.67]I know that life.
[156:11.97]Choose your champions.
[156:14.63]Yeah, my screen's flickering still.
[156:16.59]Hopefully it doesn't happen in-game that much.
[156:19.33]Is it in OBS Capture, or is it just your screen?
[156:21.77]Well, the game can't be captured with Game Capture.
[156:24.49]You need OBS Studio, which I don't have.
[156:26.81]Oh, wow.
[156:27.63]So I'm doing monitor capture, and apparently every so often in the HUD and menus, it flickers.
[156:37.58]Don't ask me why.
[156:38.82]even know like regular obs still works haven't they like not updated that no I I I only switched because of the paladins that wasn't working it's a good thing that I switched in general but yeah it doesn't work for some reason the reason I switched to obs uh multi-platform or whatever it's called is because you can your local vods can be a higher quality
[157:03.02]I always thought that OBS Studio had a ton of problems.
[157:06.67]Yeah, but it's been updated.
[157:07.77]It gets updated once a month.
[157:09.79]When do we get paid?
[157:11.41]Let me just give it a try.
[157:14.96]Seems quite good.
[157:16.22]I never play Payload in this game, so I don't know where to go.
[157:20.80]Whoops.
[157:21.08]He'll figure it out, dummy.
[157:23.29]Let me see something.
[157:31.68]Everyone's star said he doesn't play this game.
[157:34.24]Yeah?
[157:36.04]You have 90 hours in this game.
[157:38.42]What?
[157:39.78]Do I?
[157:40.56]Yes.
[157:41.42]Unless I can't read.
[157:44.15]I saw it in Steam.
[157:45.45]I think I fixed it.
[157:47.49]Did I fix it?
[157:48.13]I think I fixed it, guys.
[157:48.89]Oh, God.
[157:51.49]What is this guy?
[157:54.11]What is his moves?
[157:54.73]Holy shit.
[157:55.32]What is this guy's moves?
[157:59.46]There's a heal and something else.
[158:03.14]Well, did you know that I'm the best Bomb King?
[158:07.80]Are you?
[158:10.72]The only reason I can't be the best Bomb King is because I'm already the best Drogos.
[158:16.97]There's like a whole order to these things.
[158:18.49]Alright, figuring this guy out.
[158:23.39]Got it.
[158:29.82]I can't wait to see another 130,000 damage round.
[158:33.02]Go.
[158:34.56]I don't think it'll go long enough.
[158:37.36]That's all about the percent damage, you know?
[158:59.70]Oh, that's where... Wait, come back!
[159:01.02]Come back!
[159:01.30]Come back!
[159:02.46]I pulled him!
[159:03.56]Oh, you did!
[159:07.26]Oh, you got him.
[159:08.44]You're good.
[159:08.94]You got him.
[159:11.40]I'm being told I have 16 hours in the game.
[159:14.61]There's no way I have 90.
[159:16.41]Yeah, same thing.
[159:18.17]16 hours.
[159:20.91]Pretty similar.
[159:22.29]Very similar, actually.
[159:24.15]Oh boy, that's such a way.
[159:25.17]16, 90.
[159:37.50]Dude, I'm dying over here.
[159:38.88]I don't like this guy.
[159:39.58]I'm on the car if you need help.
[159:42.33]This is not like the guy how he used to be.
[159:43.73]They changed this guy, huh?
[159:45.39]Yeah, they changed a lot of stuff in this game.
[159:48.03]I actually never played this game before.
[160:00.30]I did fix the play.
[160:01.28]I guess taking it out of full screen might help.
[160:03.40]Come on.
[160:06.13]Where's my team?
[160:08.53]Jarvis is just fiddling with this freaking dumpster.
[160:15.36]My dumpster?
[160:16.96]Yeah.
[160:19.30]Enemy killing spree.
[160:20.72]I don't know what to do.
[160:22.50]Bring it on.
[160:22.84]Don't you actually stream from inside of a dumpster, Jarvis?
[160:28.03]Yeah.
[160:30.85]There's pretty good internet in here.
[160:33.59]Very, very good acoustics.
[160:35.33]Yeah, I know.
[160:36.75]No echo at all.
[160:38.19]There should be a lot of garbage in there.
[160:46.66]A lot of people in there.
[160:49.42]Oh my god, I'm not the best bomb king.
[160:51.86]I should have hit him easy.
[160:54.00]I should have had the three people behind him help me.
[160:55.96]Fuck.
[160:58.65]I think I've added myself to another problem.
[161:00.37]I think I have input delay now unfortunately.
[161:04.48]Oh well.
[161:10.42]Oh well.
[161:11.02]Oh dang.
[161:13.18]I delayed him for you.
[161:14.49]Thank you.
[161:15.49]I'm sorry I couldn't save you but they both instantly died.
[161:29.53]Also, one of our teams is AFK, I think.
[161:33.77]And it's not Jerma, so it's like two people.
[161:36.25]I have nothing to say, ever.
[161:43.57]You really were just AFK, fiddling with your team.
[161:48.19]I'm currently fighting right now.
[161:49.59]The spirits do not rest.
[161:58.34]Go in, go in, go in, go in.
[162:09.40]Your sight fails you.
[162:11.57]Watch out, this room, this room.
[162:12.61]I think we've, uh... Oh, that's the stuff.
[162:25.05]Oh, that's a ton.
[162:34.38]Left here really enjoyed that line But isn't that like such a well-done voice Whoa, I instantly died that's what the hell is happening
[163:06.24]So soon?
[163:07.91]But I didn't even please my master.
[163:09.71]Hold on, Tag.
[163:20.51]I'm coming.
[163:21.93]That's a grenade.
[163:45.88]I don't want to die.
[163:51.77]I don't like ults that do that.
[163:54.07]Give people just full health.
[163:55.27]There's only one.
[163:59.43]Oh, but I mean like Winston and him, every time it happens, I'm not a fan.
[164:05.48]Oh, I'm in trouble.
[164:07.52]Like they're tanks or something.
[164:09.18]I don't like this one.
[164:10.10]I don't like this guy.
[164:15.80]Ooh, shiny in chrome.
[164:20.80]Ready?
[164:22.92]Jump, jump, jump.
[164:23.80]I'm trying, I'm trying, I'm trying.
[164:24.84]Enemy killing spree.
[164:28.43]30 seconds remaining.
[165:00.55]I did nothing that whole game.
[165:02.13]Yeah, how does that work?
[165:04.15]Why is an overtime a thing?
[165:05.67]I don't know.
[165:06.23]I don't clickbait a lot.
[165:07.29]Everyone plays Siege in this game.
[165:13.29]I don't even get it.
[165:14.93]You know what I mean?
[165:15.51]I just don't get it.
[165:22.05]Pip's voice sounds familiar.
[165:23.13]It kind of does.
[165:27.30]Okay.
[165:29.13]Okay.
[165:31.17]Okay.
[165:36.75]I also made sure to equip the Bomb King voice so I can be annoying.
[165:41.07]I accidentally got off my horse.
[165:43.21]Did you pay for that voice back?
[165:49.73]Woo!
[165:55.79]Oh, he's dead.
[165:57.05]I don't know why I just wasted that on him.
[166:01.61]Shouldn't have.
[166:05.89]Dude, you got him.
[166:08.11]I got this one.
[166:09.71]Watch out for the turtle.
[166:25.32]Bad turtle.
[166:29.88]He has been got.
[166:31.78]Don't you feel bad about just beating up McCoy when he's in his little turtle shell sometimes?
[166:35.96]No, I hate him.
[166:37.17]He's a tank.
[166:42.01]Got him again.
[166:42.51]Nice pull.
[166:43.11]He knocked me out.
[166:45.63]Watch out for that bomb.
[166:53.51]Oh my goodness.
[166:54.23]I don't even know who's shooting at me.
[166:57.68]Because you totally wouldn't be able to hear where I came from.
[167:00.36]This is bad.
[167:02.40]This is not good.
[167:15.27]Wow.
[167:15.81]I can't do anything.
[167:26.92]Yeah, it kinda sucks that our DPS people aren't in the group.
[167:30.30]It's way easier.
[167:30.92]This is a Minecraft ripoff.
[167:32.40]I'm being a dummy.
[167:33.42]I'm gonna stop being a dummy, and I'm gonna show Tag what a big boy is.
[167:54.95]Alright, I'm watching.
[167:56.19]Big boy.
[167:56.99]That guy was chasing me too.
[167:59.15]Thanks for the kill.
[168:01.58]I happened to actually do something for once.
[168:04.06]Just fall down.
[168:15.70]I got a chicken.
[168:16.28]That felt really laggy.
[168:18.99]You guys want to do some chickens?
[168:27.53]Oh my god, I'm being such a baddie.
[168:32.27]Got a boy here.
[168:33.37]I tried to jump up there, it didn't really work though.
[168:39.92]That was not a smart idea.
[168:42.30]Nice shot.
[168:44.99]Was it a nice shot?
[168:47.49]It was.
[169:05.33]It's a long time to go around this corner, doesn't it?
[169:16.22]Could this... Could this be it?
[169:18.42]Could this be... Where is he?
[169:23.14]I heard a tree.
[169:27.48]He's dead.
[169:29.47]He's dead.
[169:32.81]Is a dead tree psycho there's a turtle down here the guy with the chain to do with the chain I Need help I
[170:01.99]Probably shouldn't be spreading myself out this much, but I really don't know what I'm doing, so who cares.
[170:06.35]Whatever.
[170:12.76]Oh my.
[170:14.58]Wow.
[170:16.18]I think we might have bots on our team.
[170:21.18]Really?
[170:22.54]How can you tell?
[170:23.82]Either that or they're using controllers.
[170:30.49]The spirits do not rest.
[170:34.30]Oh lord, chickens.
[170:36.28]That may have looked unnecessary, but what do you know?
[170:51.40]Shit.
[170:54.30]What do you know?
[170:54.92]I need my bomb queen.
[171:01.46]There's a victor out here and he wants blood Watch out behind you
[171:29.68]Cassie can't move and shoot at the same time They're all snowed Nice
[171:57.97]How would you guys feel about me just staying in the bush?
[171:59.99]Nice, nice.
[172:01.23]Good job, Tag.
[172:04.31]Yeah, let's all do the bush strat.
[172:06.33]Bush strats, huh?
[172:07.33]Bush, yeah.
[172:07.77]How does that work?
[172:09.28]I'm gonna be a bush guy.
[172:11.16]Everyone's dying.
[172:14.36]Enemies are firing on me.
[172:16.94]Just look at the Cassie, dude.
[172:18.12]There's no way about it.
[172:24.98]I have chickens when they come in.
[172:27.23]Dude chickens.
[172:28.59]God damn it.
[172:37.42]Oh my god, it seems really that big of a loser.
[172:41.22]Huh?
[172:41.64]Their archer is just waiting at the teleporter, staring at it.
[172:46.10]You got nothing better to do?
[172:50.88]We did it!
[172:57.67]Good job, guys.
[172:58.11]Did you just pat your belly?
[173:00.25]No, I clapped my hands together real fast.
[173:07.35]Apparently, I did it.
[173:14.78]Oh, no.
[173:15.20]This is going to be an awful play.
[173:17.12]Oh, no.
[173:17.40]This is when you baited them and they're both full health.
[173:21.46]Oh.
[173:22.94]Dude.
[173:23.94]My savior, but not really.
[173:25.38]But, you know.
[173:26.79]That was pretty funny, actually.
[173:30.67]Oh my god, my damage.
[173:37.11]We should probably put it on Siege only.
[173:44.54]Crybaby.
[173:46.18]Actually, you know what, I kind of agree.
[173:49.23]Beach has been a lot more fun.
[173:51.71]Sam, thanks for the five bucks.
[173:52.47]Yeah, this game's strength is definitely in that game.
[173:53.87]I want to hear the worst, cheesiest joke you can think of.
[173:56.26]It can tag out damage, Steve.
[173:59.06]Yeah.
[173:59.80]I don't know.
[174:01.20]That was not a very good game.
[174:03.24]To be fair, Bomb King isn't really that crazy of a damage dealer.
[174:06.58]He's more of a zoner.
[174:11.01]Everything I know is wrong.
[174:14.16]He looks like he does a ton of damage, but he mostly just keeps people off the point and stuff.
[174:19.02]Is that what you do, Steve?
[174:24.24]Just keep people off the point and stuff?
[174:25.88]No.
[174:28.98]That's where the credit ends.
[174:32.38]Will, sarcasm.
[174:33.28]1,200 bits.
[174:34.50]I want to be the pumpkin king, but I can't.
[174:37.74]Thanks a lot, Will.
[174:40.82]Will, good dude.
[174:41.88]Thanks, dude.
[174:42.20]You can't anymore.
[174:43.26]Dude, dude.
[174:45.77]All your 90 hours in this game, you didn't think to open this.
[174:54.92]Refer a friend.
[174:56.91]Star, do you think you can refer a friend and get a tree in Tribe's Ascent?
[175:02.45]Um, possibly.
[175:13.18]I did.
[175:13.72]Look, no one negativity.
[175:15.50]Okay, you have to say something nice about me, and I'm going to say something nice about you, okay?
[175:20.00]You are a fantastic caster.
[175:23.03]I've seen you cast, like, Overwatch tournaments.
[175:25.05]You're very good on camera.
[175:26.81]You're very fucking professional, and you're a sweet guy.
[175:30.49]Go ahead.
[175:30.99]My turn.
[175:32.69]You have great nipples.
[175:37.77]They're just excellent.
[175:41.31]I've seen them.
[175:43.71]Everyone has.
[175:46.19]Shut up.
[175:47.33]No one has seen them.
[175:50.49]No one.
[175:51.49]No one's seen those.
[175:57.07]Why should I be ashamed of my body, huh?
[175:58.73]Why should I be ashamed of my body?
[176:00.87]You shouldn't.
[176:01.39]It's a compliment.
[176:02.21]Good.
[176:03.53]They're fucking great.
[176:04.95]How does that sound?
[176:08.02]Are you face-camming today?
[176:09.09]You've been doing that more.
[176:10.37]No, not today.
[176:11.97]What's the deal with that?
[176:12.75]I don't know.
[176:15.07]I was playing Wii games.
[176:16.27]Oh, it's Mike.
[176:17.07]And people want to see the guy with the funny Wii controller moving around, right?
[176:21.76]That guy must Mike.
[176:27.24]What should I play here?
[176:28.16]What are you guys doing?
[176:30.30]I need to redeem myself as Bomb King.
[176:33.49]Uh...
[176:37.63]They don't give you very much time at all, do they?
[176:42.30]They give you like, what, 20 seconds?
[176:44.20]Yeah, it's kind of stressful.
[176:45.20]I know, really.
[176:46.38]Yeah, every time I get down to the wire and freak out.
[176:56.09]Frog Island.
[176:56.97]Oh, I already like this place.
[176:59.59]Oh, this is where I'm supposed to play Shy Guy?
[177:02.08]Ooh.
[177:06.29]I haven't had a bad Shy Guy game on this map ever.
[177:10.77]I'm two for two.
[177:24.78]The battle is about to begin.
[177:29.91]Healing totem, okay.
[177:34.20]That's just a healing totem that makes you, like, walk around.
[177:39.27]That shoots a little pulse, okay.
[177:41.89]I love walking.
[177:43.29]I love walking around.
[177:44.07]Let the battle begin!
[177:46.78]Who says that?
[177:49.30]You.
[177:49.44]No.
[178:01.76]God damn it.
[178:03.18]I'm so dead.
[178:04.14]God damn it.
[178:06.20]I'm a thrower.
[178:07.30]Oh, I can't shoot him anymore.
[178:09.98]That's not cool.
[178:11.24]Oh my god.
[178:14.69]The rector just got thrown off the map.
[178:33.79]the point if you need it.
[178:44.76]Is that like a Zarya situation?
[178:46.50]Does that guy like to do more damage?
[178:47.70]No, not as far as I know, because I've been shooting it.
[179:09.14]They're all stunned I was too far away.
[179:21.15]I can also only throw snakes at people So my ult is what You like summon a thunderstorm it's just like a big circle around me.
[179:33.69]Yeah, I
[179:44.04]Oh, I thought it might have been the turtle shell.
[179:53.98]Alright, that's the best voice.
[179:55.93]Who?
[179:56.95]The guy that does the loud, weird laugh.
[180:02.99]Who's laughing?
[180:05.93]What the hell was that?
[180:07.39]Okay.
[180:11.94]I think we did okay.
[180:12.70]I'm the king.
[180:15.83]I want to be the king.
[180:19.69]Have you redeemed yourself now?
[180:21.47]No, I'm playing really bad again.
[180:23.29]I'm the greatest.
[180:25.91]I probably have three times more deaths than anyone on the team.
[180:30.33]How many times did you die?
[180:32.37]Like 60.
[180:33.61]Wow.
[180:37.03]That's a lot.
[180:37.85]That is a lot.
[180:40.90]Five.
[180:43.12]Capture Oh I'm dumb
[181:10.32]I have an ult, I just couldn't get in.
[181:12.62]I just wanted to not be dumb.
[181:16.66]I could have just jumped in and hit Q, but I wouldn't have healed anybody.
[181:21.22]How do we help you not be dumb?
[181:22.56]I don't know.
[181:23.56]I don't think it's possible.
[181:28.32]I'll get my best men on it.
[181:29.76]Ready to go in and do crazy things?
[181:31.28]Let's do it!
[181:34.15]Nah, I'll just take that.
[181:38.87]you killed him I was hoping more people would be coming to the point name or not alright if we all just focus on the payload
[182:07.50]Oh my god, he missed that completely.
[182:09.50]I couldn't even tell what the hell was just happening, but it's okay.
[182:19.06]Maldamba missed his ultimate and just shot it behind the point.
[182:23.25]And went straight over.
[182:24.55]Oh, come on.
[182:27.75]He does so much damage.
[182:28.59]Yeah, she does.
[182:33.87]I'm a big fan, but when you have to level all your characters to level 4, you don't get to play the characters you like anymore.
[182:40.84]I mean, no one plays the competitive mode on this game, so... Well, I'm playing as Kotal Kahn.
[182:46.14]He does kind of look like Kotal Kahn.
[182:47.16]That makes me feel better.
[182:47.74]I'm done then.
[182:50.62]I'm just going to play Eevee.
[182:58.59]Kotal Kahn wins.
[183:09.99]How many more?
[183:11.37]What are you doing buddy?
[183:17.53]He's dying!
[183:18.67]Why does nobody play competitive?
[183:20.17]Why does nobody play competitive?
[183:31.87]I guess there's not enough people, or the requirements for unlocking competitive are a little bit too strict.
[183:37.91]So then you get really long queue times.
[183:42.65]Thanks a lot, Spencer.
[183:43.98]Are they better games now?
[183:45.30]I don't know, I still never played it.
[183:46.72]I've never played it before in the game.
[183:50.76]And Magpie.
[183:51.54]I'm at like 8 out of 12 characters.
[183:53.42]5 bucks, thank you, dude.
[183:54.40]I'm playing a lot.
[183:56.20]That's my favorite pasta.
[183:56.94]90 hours.
[183:58.11]ZD.
[183:58.39]Yeah, 90 hours, still can't play competitive.
[184:04.35]I'm going to play Eevee or Karl Drogo.
[184:09.72]He's that man.
[184:11.20]Yeah.
[184:12.64]He's from the realm of dragons.
[184:15.22]What, nobody plays this game in competitive?
[184:18.35]Is this game still in beta?
[184:20.31]Yes.
[184:20.95]Is it really?
[184:21.75]Yes.
[184:26.03]Oh, well, alright.
[184:27.01]I guess.
[184:34.92]What else do they want to add?
[184:36.66]It feels like there's plenty of stuff in the game at this point.
[184:42.68]They gotta do a smite and then make the whole game and then remake it.
[184:45.66]Wait, what?
[184:47.02]Haven't they remade this like three times?
[184:49.72]Oh, that's true, too.
[184:51.36]Because when you start the game, you don't have 12 heroes.
[184:53.74]You have to, like, unlock heroes before you can even get into competitive.
[184:57.66]And then you have to get 12 heroes up to rank 4.
[184:59.48]That ugly goblin is still the same ugly goblin.
[185:04.01]I saw a picture of, like, the beginning of the game, and he could, like, fly.
[185:09.13]How do I feel about tuna?
[185:13.05]And Ying didn't used to be support.
[185:14.63]She used to be, like, a damage dealer or something.
[185:16.67]They don't know what they're doing.
[185:19.99]never made a game before how do you guys feel about tuna disgusting yeah alright so I'm the only one that likes it I just first remind me of vagina okay alright it's the first mental association I have a tuna okay thank you well are we talking like tuna out of the can or like tuna steaks I was thinking about tuna out of the can like the smell of it tuna like steaks um you got my you got my vote
[185:47.41]I used to think that like tuna out of the can looks so good and I try it and then it was gross.
[185:52.65]And then like six months later, I go back again just like, you know what?
[185:55.61]That looks so good.
[185:56.28]Let me try it again.
[185:59.38]It never worked out between us.
[186:01.04]I like tuna.
[186:02.54]Although I do like most fish except for a few different kinds.
[186:06.76]I'm surprised.
[186:11.26]I thought you guys would be like, yeah, tuna's great.
[186:14.93]Sorry we let you down.
[186:18.39]not great why were you like planning us like a tuna surprise party no uh somebody asked that's honestly one of the things you probably never want to hear what is this person is this person like a sniper or something yes that is literally a sniper okay well let's try it I'm apparently played her before okay this is yeah this is the Widowmaker right
[186:49.25]Yes.
[186:49.47]The gun turns into a sniper.
[186:51.53]Yeah.
[186:52.15]Yeah, the Widowmaker.
[186:53.40]She's a sniper.
[186:54.64]Yeah, it's Widowmaker now, not like... The gun turns into... Isn't a sniper rifle always a gun?
[186:59.72]No, the assault... It's like... And then it like... Turns into the sniper rifle.
[187:09.19]She can teleport too, though.
[187:10.21]That's... Man or woman, young or old, my sights are steady and my trigger cold.
[187:19.28]Yeah.
[187:20.06]Oh, yeah.
[187:20.40]I had a wormhole.
[187:21.32]I have never played with wormhole before, so we'll try that.
[187:27.23]So that's the teleport.
[187:28.05]What are they?
[187:28.43]What's the little mine things do?
[187:30.53]They slow people.
[187:31.39]Okay.
[187:34.10]And they do like four damage a tick, I think.
[187:35.74]I don't know.
[187:36.94]Depends on what your deck is, though.
[187:38.62]The battle is about to begin.
[187:43.43]Alright.
[187:50.11]Okay, well.
[187:52.09]Whatever.
[187:52.53]No one get past my personal space.
[187:54.97]Are you using the skin?
[187:58.00]Yeah, because it makes his gun look cooler.
[188:00.58]The skin!
[188:02.84]Ah, I missed the jump.
[188:09.26]Unacceptable.
[188:10.88]I got the high ground, guys.
[188:11.83]Oh, this character's fucking insane.
[188:18.17]Okay.
[188:21.79]They have one.
[188:22.27]I got her.
[188:31.18]I'm helping!
[188:32.16]Trying to help!
[188:32.70]Nice!
[188:33.22]I missed so many shots there, thanks.
[188:38.68]That was just absolutely unfortunate how bad I was just playing.
[188:44.42]Chill out!
[188:45.12]Get it?
[188:45.78]That pun was a rip-off.
[188:50.86]Did you guys get it?
[188:51.82]Yeah.
[188:52.12]I wish people would stop copying the late, great Arnie.
[188:58.70]Where are you?
[189:21.88]No, that feels nice!
[189:23.14]Uh, that's copyright.
[189:28.10]Aim?
[189:32.76]Yeah, well, sorry I missed a few shots.
[189:41.71]Wow, I'm being terrible right now.
[189:46.40]I just have to, like, tell myself that and just stop.
[189:48.60]Where the fuck was that guy?
[189:51.92]No, he was above me.
[189:55.38]That character exists?
[189:56.40]Okay.
[190:02.55]Who?
[190:02.79]Karl Drogo?
[190:03.67]The one that can fly?
[190:05.31]Yeah.
[190:08.55]He doesn't even know about Karl Drogo.
[190:13.23]There's a guy behind us.
[190:23.79]I'm gonna stop being terrible.
[190:26.19]I gotta believe in you.
[190:26.93]I think Derm is carrying us this game.
[190:35.44]Uh, I wouldn't say that.
[190:37.58]I'm like the guy that uses ultimate right before we're gonna win.
[190:39.90]Dude, I really don't care.
[190:42.10]I really don't care.
[190:46.58]You wanna know why?
[190:48.30]Dude, do you see that I have cosmetics on this character?
[190:51.74]Oh my goodness.
[190:54.28]That's how confident I am.
[190:56.18]As I have cosmetics.
[190:59.91]That's how confident I am.
[191:00.77]Look at that.
[191:01.23]See the little spinny?
[191:05.47]It doesn't seem like Jermis is having a good time.
[191:07.61]Engineer!
[191:08.09]Engineer!
[191:08.59]What?
[191:17.08]Yeah, alright.
[191:17.58]Alright, high res.
[191:18.20]Have fun in fucking court.
[191:19.48]Oh, I forgot that I even have Ice Block.
[191:23.79]That's news.
[191:31.23]Oh my god, I forgot to get Riding Mastery.
[191:32.71]Is that a thing you need?
[191:38.59]We are stronger than death!
[191:40.45]Try and run!
[191:49.79]Ooh, he dead.
[191:51.94]Aw, I want to get the kills.
[191:57.14]I want to frag out.
[191:59.06]What's my team doing?
[192:04.61]Let me get some credit for that one, chat.
[192:09.65]Let me get some credit for that one, chat.
[192:13.17]Good shot.
[192:17.88]That's cool.
[192:21.60]My favorite characters in a game ever no, it's pretty cool.
[192:25.78]Yeah Too bad she's a ripoff Arnold Schwarzenegger pun soon.
[192:32.50]I don't Schwarzenegger came with Evie first Please get this turbo off of me
[192:42.93]Whoa, that's loud, and I don't know what he's doing.
[192:47.17]Not me!
[192:47.69]Yeah, me!
[192:52.95]That was the sniper that killed me, really?
[192:56.99]Now it's personal.
[193:07.28]If only she didn't have Ice Block, because Ice Block's dumb.
[193:21.09]Mmm, where are they?
[193:23.25]I'm gonna Ice Tornado if you're going.
[193:25.75]Alright.
[193:29.01]Oh, I insta-died.
[193:31.95]They like saw me and shit, like I don't understand how that works.
[193:38.28]How do you like see me?
[193:40.38]I'm not playing great at the moment.
[193:42.38]I was earlier, not anymore.
[193:45.44]I lost it.
[193:45.82]I still got this.
[193:47.53]I believe.
[193:53.47]Ow!
[193:53.71]Holy shit!
[193:55.31]Wow.
[193:55.63]Oh, hit him right in the head too.
[194:30.57]A tactical garment.
[194:32.81]15 seconds remaining.
[194:35.66]What does this all do again?
[194:38.56]Just an image multiplier.
[194:39.96]Damn it.
[194:41.86]I used it for no reason.
[194:42.82]I'll remember this.
[194:48.04]Overtime.
[194:49.32]We are stronger together.
[194:51.18]We might actually be able to do this.
[194:52.52]Ow.
[194:58.88]My head hurts.
[195:01.40]Take some acetaminophen.
[195:06.64]I'm coming.
[195:10.02]Yeah, yeah.
[195:13.57]Oh, fuck.
[195:14.21]Who doesn't have to win the next one?
[195:18.99]I played pretty terribly right there.
[195:20.63]Sorry, sorry, sorry.
[195:24.73]It's okay.
[195:31.12]I could have teleported on the cart, but, you know, my brain.
[195:35.21]Press B. What?
[195:41.11]Wow.
[195:42.53]I'm so glad I didn't pay for that one.
[195:49.63]What?
[195:50.57]That guy's being creepy.
[195:53.55]He's trying to have sex with me.
[195:55.15]In a game.
[195:56.27]That's messed up.
[195:58.55]I'd prefer he didn't.
[195:59.30]What are you talking about?
[196:02.61]I'm talking about coffee, Cheetos, and chicken.
[196:04.17]Oh, God.
[196:14.72]Ah, he's so low.
[196:15.40]I can still see him.
[196:16.14]Come on.
[196:16.36]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[196:17.06]Three, two, one.
[196:19.04]No.
[196:21.28]Really?
[196:24.58]Really, dude?
[196:30.66]Ah, damn it.
[196:33.68]I have a lot of time on point.
[196:34.70]I think still I don't like how far my blink is.
[196:39.67]They're going to get the point.
[196:41.61]I guess they are.
[196:42.29]Damn it.
[197:04.82]Alright, now I'm going to try to use my ult.
[197:06.92]Oh, my God.
[197:12.88]Fuck this horse.
[197:14.82]Try and run.
[197:21.24]Ooh.
[197:22.46]Ooh.
[197:26.96]You kind of went pretty far.
[197:32.44]I wish you could all see how bad I'm kicking their tail.
[197:37.37]Those hitboxes.
[197:38.25]Those hitboxes didn't make any fucking sense.
[197:40.45]I wish you could all see how bad I'm kicking their tail.
[197:43.79]I would be bad about that if I was on his team.
[197:45.67]I wish you could all see how bad I'm kicking their tail.
[197:49.59]Oh, this is going to be great.
[197:50.69]Hitboxes in this game don't make much sense often, it seems like.
[197:54.11]This end is great.
[197:59.94]I hope they show it.
[198:01.48]It's hilarious.
[198:06.14]That was not close.
[198:07.28]Oh, they didn't show it!
[198:08.93]That last shot is so funny.
[198:10.73]I didn't even come close to hitting her.
[198:12.59]And she was standing still.
[198:15.93]There's a gigantic hitbox above their head for some reason.
[198:28.40]I don't think I even have enough cards to do a... Like an actual loadout.
[198:37.63]But hey, thank you Grubby for the sub, and Jib the Great.
[198:40.19]Welcome, guys.
[198:41.01]Thank you for your subs.
[198:42.89]And then thank you for the bits, Laser Donut and Darren J. Here's 100 credits.
[198:48.79]We got the Linguini.
[198:56.01]Somebody just asked me that.
[198:57.46]Like, 15 minutes ago.
[198:58.86]I said ziti.
[198:59.88]Really?
[199:02.16]Food stream.
[199:03.38]I guess, yeah.
[199:07.02]Alright.
[199:07.48]It depends on the sauce, really.
[199:09.70]I mean, if we're counting ramen as a pasta, which you should, probably.
[199:14.36]You're not going to be stingy.
[199:19.28]Not a pasta.
[199:20.61]You don't go to a pasta restaurant and get ramen.
[199:23.61]But I mean, like, udon is a type of noodle, which is a pasta.
[199:27.91]Dan, the viewing man.
[199:29.27]Can you put a little sauce in your ramen?
[199:32.29]You get it at the Olive Garden?
[199:34.09]Wait, no, I'm dumb, right?
[199:38.85]Yeah.
[199:39.49]You said it, not me.
[199:40.58]Yeah, I am.
[199:41.12]I don't know what a pasta is.
[199:49.93]I like pasta when it's mixed with chicken or shrimp or something.
[199:53.85]Or tuna.
[199:55.97]I mean, tuna casserole exists.
[199:59.50]I don't want to know that.
[200:01.54]Actually, it's good.
[200:02.10]I don't want to know that.
[200:07.58]It's got, what is it, like ziti on top?
[200:10.04]Tuna casserole in the middle?
[200:11.52]Whatever's in it.
[200:15.09]Well, I can unlock a character, I think.
[200:18.05]Bomb King!
[200:19.76]Make sure you get the right one.
[200:21.74]Sha Lin.
[200:24.50]I'm going to try Sha Lin.
[200:26.08]Ah, excellent.
[200:31.57]I'm going to try that guy.
[200:41.76]You fucking love tuna casserole?
[200:43.24]I'm sure it's great.
[200:44.82]Sha Lin.
[200:46.40]I think I've only had it like once or twice in my life.
[200:48.92]Like no one ever makes that.
[200:51.94]There's a reason.
[200:54.54]It's probably a very delicate recipe.
[200:56.75]Looks like Star's on tank duty.
[200:58.95]It's also muted in here.
[201:03.19]You got lucky this time.
[201:04.29]I ain't doing it.
[201:05.87]I don't care.
[201:06.97]You think I care?
[201:10.37]Yeah.
[201:12.35]Customize your champions.
[201:17.63]It's like too much shit down here to customize.
[201:20.44]That's really... You can change like your eye color.
[201:28.12]Yeah, that's pretty dope.
[201:32.23]For like 5,000 gold?
[201:34.09]Yeah, for 5,000 gold you can change like sometimes your headgear will change color in one spot.
[201:39.85]You'll never be able to see it.
[201:43.78]What a deal.
[201:44.72]Alright, my journey leads me to battle.
[201:47.64]So be it.
[201:48.14]Okay, so just hold.
[201:51.62]Okay.
[201:57.97]Knockback.
[201:59.93]They hit a wall.
[202:02.63]Okay, wait.
[202:06.57]Ready?
[202:09.44]What the fuck?
[202:10.14]The battle is about to begin.
[202:28.02]That person's trying to be me I'm gonna go in the back cuz canessa is gonna be there and fuck hurt you Actually, we have we have an EVA to do that.
[202:43.75]She better do a goddamn.
[202:44.77]She's not gonna do it.
[202:45.73]Come on Oh, they're all on the point.
[202:49.16]Oh No, she went and did it
[203:06.06]Okay.
[203:07.72]Cool.
[203:08.56]Well, that worked.
[203:13.74]That's just like a jump backwards thing?
[203:17.70]What is Canessa doing?
[203:20.56]That was weird.
[203:21.10]I did not expect that at all.
[203:22.42]That was just terrifying.
[203:32.31]What is what are they doing?
[204:02.55]I don't know.
[204:03.25]Oh, good fall.
[204:09.51]What are they doing?
[204:10.98]They're running in one by one.
[204:12.82]Man, she has the nerve to tell me it was a lucky shot every time.
[204:22.26]I wonder if I can zipline to you while you're flying around.
[204:26.93]I'm going to try right now.
[204:29.57]Can you actually connect to people?
[204:31.93]yeah that's like the majority of the reason why you always like zipline somewhere that you're not supposed to someone walks in front of you I got you I just ran into the bomb I I'm still like trying to figure out my moves well cut it out they come from you can't help it
[205:03.99]So you can just, like, spam arrows, I guess?
[205:07.15]Yep.
[205:07.81]It's pretty good.
[205:09.75]Okay.
[205:15.81]One would even say, woohoo.
[205:18.69]Woohoo!
[205:23.03]I think you... I think you, Nin?
[205:26.06]My hand.
[205:28.26]Welcome to the family.
[205:31.36]So if I use my ult out of spawn, do I get there faster?
[205:33.42]Why don't you try it?
[205:42.67]Nah, you put me on the horsey.
[205:44.43]Attack!
[205:48.06]Actually, one of their most recent patches was that you can't use your ultimate while you're in spawn.
[205:53.10]People used to always fatfinger them.
[206:12.71]Bad guys.
[206:13.57]Bad guys.
[206:14.81]Bad guy's gone.
[206:16.89]We're winning too much.
[206:20.08]This is when I just upgrade my movement speed over and over again.
[206:26.60]We did it.
[206:28.00]We're doing it.
[206:29.86]We're doing it too much.
[206:32.68]I'm just waiting.
[206:33.58]He just rolled right past me.
[206:41.54]He put his shield up for one millisecond?
[206:43.98]This is like overwhelming me.
[206:54.16]This is child's play.
[206:58.09]I want to shoot guys.
[207:01.41]Look at our streaks on our team.
[207:12.57]That's what that is.
[207:13.59]Oh, he one hit.
[207:15.03]Oh, what?
[207:16.53]What?
[207:18.11]Where?
[207:18.63]Jerma, I think that means you're the first person to die.
[207:21.05]It is.
[207:22.47]I did die.
[207:23.09]What the fuck?
[207:24.23]Oh, that's what it was.
[207:25.41]I got sniped.
[207:28.48]Dude, I didn't even know they had a sniper.
[207:31.24]You played it last round!
[207:32.80]No, I didn't know they had a sniper.
[207:34.30]Oh, okay.
[207:35.00]I thought you were like, I didn't know they had one in this game.
[207:37.08]No, like the other two.
[207:38.54]What?
[207:40.21]There's a sniper in this fucking game?
[207:41.81]No way!
[207:43.35]I can't believe it!
[207:46.01]I mean, like, I didn't even know they had a sniper.
[207:49.33]Okay, okay, okay.
[207:51.53]You had me worried.
[207:52.91]Oh!
[208:10.96]I'm getting lazy now.
[208:14.80]I thought I was just gonna win right there, so I just used my ult.
[208:17.56]Oh, there we go.
[208:18.52]Oh, we did.
[208:20.46]Man, I wonder who got play of the game.
[208:21.82]Yeah, it was.
[208:23.48]I don't know why.
[208:24.83]Thank you, Epic Hunter.
[208:26.79]ZZ for the sub.
[208:27.93]Welcome, dude.
[208:34.77]Oh, you dropped Meteor and then...
[208:39.36]This is an awful player.
[208:46.16]I got way better than that.
[208:50.97]I even specifically know the one I thought it was going to be and then it wasn't.
[208:54.69]I didn't really do much that whole game.
[208:57.87]It's all good.
[209:04.54]Is this game only on the Nintendo Switch?
[209:06.14]Yes.
[209:11.33]Your team had a couple of eliminations.
[209:21.69]Yeah, they were both me.
[209:31.33]Whoa, what is it?
[209:31.83]Hold up.
[209:32.23]Hold the fuck up.
[209:33.51]I know those XP sounds.
[209:38.43]Where is it from?
[209:42.06]They're from Kotor?
[209:43.26]Gotta say, since these two showed up, it just hasn't been going anywhere.
[209:48.40]What hasn't been going anywhere?
[209:50.54]It's games.
[209:55.31]Partying.
[209:55.89]OP.
[209:56.95]I gotta figure out what's for dinner.
[209:58.53]That hasn't gone anywhere either.
[210:02.75]I'm so hungry.
[210:04.03]It's gonna be like Chinese food.
[210:07.18]Well, I can order that like right now.
[210:11.98]Right now?
[210:13.14]Right now.
[210:15.14]I want to go over and do a skate stream with Jerma.
[210:18.69]What a TF2 coach.
[210:20.67]Right now?
[210:22.01]What are you talking about?
[210:23.33]I want to do a skate stream with you.
[210:25.77]I've never played Skate 3.
[210:27.53]What are you even talking about?
[210:30.17]Can't you plug in two controllers and we can play horse?
[210:33.79]I mean, if one were to have played Skate 3 before, they might know that that's possible, but I can't tell you.
[210:40.86]I don't know.
[210:43.87]I'm sure it does have something like that.
[210:47.75]Chat, does Skate 3 have horse?
[210:56.89]I have the original disk for Tony Hawk.
[211:01.63]Thank you, Mas Fritos.
[211:03.21]Welcome.
[211:03.55]I'm just going to give out the address to our apartment building and have someone in the chat order for us.
[211:12.56]Doesn't that exist?
[211:15.14]I think that is actually a thing that exists.
[211:17.26]It's called like treat stream treats.
[211:21.50]I had a profile on there and I thought I deleted it and some random guy called the force feeder ordered me a pizza and I was I was very much I would rather have not had that pizza and he made me like take a picture of it and post it on Twitter and
[211:37.71]Street Treats?
[211:40.05]Street Treat or something like that.
[211:41.33]Oh shit, 10 seconds.
[211:42.21]Oh, Street Street.
[211:43.87]Sounds like a prostitution ring.
[211:46.12]I played Fernando.
[211:47.86]The pizza street tag.
[211:50.30]I'm still going on about this.
[211:51.76]The pizza place that I always ordered from closed.
[211:54.84]Do you understand?
[211:56.28]Closed for good?
[211:57.97]It's gone.
[211:58.83]It's just gone.
[212:00.43]The breakfast place that I always used to go to that was so close, closed.
[212:06.76]It's a hole in your heart, isn't it?
[212:08.34]It hurts.
[212:08.70]Look, I don't know what I'm doing with my life half the time now.
[212:11.46]Go to the fish market.
[212:12.12]That's where we're going right now.
[212:13.06]Get some good cod.
[212:15.54]What?
[212:16.56]Get some tuna.
[212:17.22]Get some tuna.
[212:17.74]You can find it here.
[212:20.50]Fresh out of the can.
[212:21.48]Just pluck it right out the ocean.
[212:25.28]I canned it underwater while the fish was still alive.
[212:28.17]Yep.
[212:29.01]And just when you thought you were the sexiest person in the world.
[212:31.65]I will never go to the fish market.
[212:33.43]Especially not with you.
[212:36.20]Well, you're missing out.
[212:38.29]Whoops, I definitely should not have done that.
[212:39.31]What happens if I purchase items?
[212:40.95]Unless they have lobster macaroni there.
[212:43.09]I'd go for that.
[212:43.67]You'll eat lobster, but you won't eat tuna.
[212:46.05]Only lobster macaroni.
[212:47.71]Well, but still, you will eat a literal bottom feeder, but you won't eat tuna fish.
[212:52.00]Okay.
[212:54.07]Are you doing District 9?
[212:54.91]You do it way better, but I'm trying.
[212:58.01]Put it in the effort.
[212:59.75]He realized what he was trying to do.
[213:23.94]No!
[213:27.44]Alright, get behind me!
[213:33.08]Remember that time tag, you didn't want to eat a banana.
[213:35.06]Oh come on, I saw that coming too.
[213:39.11]I didn't want to eat the banana because it was bruised and gross.
[213:43.21]Help me!
[213:44.85]Help me!
[213:46.15]I'm healing, I'm healing!
[213:47.01]Help me!
[213:47.47]I like that you still remember how the banana went.
[213:51.75]No one lets me forget that banana.
[213:52.97]Because you thought about it.
[213:56.13]Sorry.
[213:58.03]That was the sloppiest ever.
[214:01.25]It was the sloppiest banana ever.
[214:02.94]I thought you meant how bad we were all just playing.
[214:06.18]No, me.
[214:06.88]That was sloppy.
[214:08.66]I thought you were trying to set it on fire.
[214:15.95]It startled me.
[214:20.66]Kill this lady on the left.
[214:23.54]I think if I just... They're not even touching me, so I think I could just heal you forever and you'll never die, Jerma.
[214:29.54]Well, that works for me.
[214:33.31]Okay, no more sloppy play.
[214:41.19]Hey, we did it.
[214:43.45]I promised no more sloppies.
[214:48.23]So who's schlopping I think there's a faster way to push that card out.
[214:51.35]I don't know why we went this way Cuz we don't have the right license Doesn't doesn't make any sense
[215:24.85]Where I protected us and why did it take my shot?
[215:27.49]Oh shoot.
[215:50.40]You're just healing the absolute shit out of me.
[215:58.14]Stop it.
[215:58.82]Stop it.
[215:59.24]Stop healing him.
[216:03.02]That was like... That was insane.
[216:04.76]Did you even die?
[216:07.02]No, I couldn't even... I was never below like 40% health.
[216:09.27]Nah.
[216:18.96]Thank you NoNameBob for the bits.
[216:20.08]Never trust a purple for the thousand bits.

[216:46.81]I think I've ever seen the last one.
[216:49.92]I think it's legendary.
[216:53.83]I don't play Eevee at all.
[216:56.35]I missed my exit.

[217:26.54]We're just winning too much.
[217:27.84]I'm just trying to make things interesting.
[217:30.10]Yeah.
[217:31.90]Sorry, everyone.
[217:32.46]You have to watch this really bullshit wind stream.

[218:03.74]I've hit every single heal on you.
[218:06.90]Shield's going down.
[218:07.78]I can't out-heal that.
[218:14.40]Oh my goodness.
[218:15.61]I have no health.
[218:17.17]Oh my god.
[218:18.63]This guy.
[218:20.17]This is so bad.
[218:24.59]Shield's up.
[218:25.45]The cavalry's here.
[218:29.38]You like my fucking pun?
[218:33.56]What?
[218:33.70]You're walking into a wall.
[218:35.86]I was gonna jump off.
[218:36.96]You're not even on your horse anymore.
[218:38.40]I was gonna jump off the edge.
[218:39.35]I remember when this game sucked and you had to, like, there was the cannons and you had to destroy the treasure chests and everything.
[218:49.21]And then they added payload and the first thing we all said was like, wow, why haven't they been doing this before?
[218:54.87]Stunned.
[218:55.97]Yeah, I started playing this game.
[218:57.16]I never played like the original version of this game.
[219:00.20]Stay behind me.
[219:01.82]I heard it was not fun.
[219:03.92]Oh, what the fuck?
[219:04.56]I thought I had it in my sights.
[219:08.66]Apparently not.
[219:26.04]The fuck is my team?
[219:27.10]No, oops!
[219:28.80]Oops!
[219:29.22]I'm starting to lose my fucking mind.
[219:47.95]I'm getting to that stage where I'm losing my fucking mind.
[219:51.43]Why?
[219:52.45]I don't know.
[219:53.75]Hey, thank you, good guy.
[219:54.45]Thank you.
[219:55.98]Thank you for being the most entertaining internet person ever.
[219:57.84]Well, thanks for two months, man.
[219:59.24]Thanks for sticking around.
[220:01.10]Voltron skills?
[220:05.70]What the fuck is my team doing?
[220:09.85]Like, ulting right now?
[220:11.41]What are you fucking doing?
[220:13.85]Oh my god, those guys are cooped on.
[220:19.49]Is this a DM Brandon impression?
[220:20.99]Learn how to fucking play the game, dude.
[220:35.64]How about we all play characters we're bad at?
[220:38.14]Get lost.
[220:39.26]What a non-insult.
[220:42.12]What a terrible insult.
[220:45.26]Get lost.
[220:45.68]Why are you trying to be mean?
[220:47.95]Pretend mean.
[220:48.83]Just kidding.
[220:50.24]I think he likes it when you're mean.
[220:52.68]He misses it.
[221:07.57]Get lost.
[221:08.11]What is this, like, the 50s?
[221:10.75]Get lost!
[221:11.55]Get lost, buddy!
[221:12.49]Uh...
[221:23.11]So toxic.
[221:24.47]I'm so hungry.
[221:26.27]Why don't you go eat something?
[221:29.11]You gotta get up to do that.
[221:30.69]I'm gaming.
[221:32.22]He's gaming.
[221:33.68]Have you ever heard of Gamer Grub?
[221:35.52]Guys, he's gaming.
[221:36.90]Gamer Grub?
[221:38.14]You gotta get some Gamer Grub.
[221:39.94]Is that like a random box of shit?
[221:42.30]Like G Fuel?
[221:45.41]I think Fatality is sponsored by Gamer Grub and it's just these packets of nuts that you eat while you're gaming.
[221:54.97]Nice.
[221:57.73]The world we live in.
[222:01.33]Probably not a thing anymore.
[222:12.20]Who else is, like, fun?
[222:14.60]I am.
[222:15.26]I'm fun.
[222:15.80]I'm fun.
[222:16.38]I'm hip.
[222:18.24]Champions.
[222:21.34]Champion-wise.
[222:23.59]I'm fun.
[222:24.17]Hey, Link fan of the year, thanks for the 10 months.
[222:28.80]You have my chat open?
[222:30.86]You should be watching my stream, dude.
[222:34.28]Did you see the crazy plays that I had last game?
[222:37.39]Yeah, yeah, you should get some Soylent, you know?
[222:39.73]But thanks for 10 months, dude.
[222:43.31]And that's the noise you make when you drink Soylent.
[222:47.63]I can't- I can never- Soylent.
[222:49.33]I'll never eat it.
[222:50.57]Ever.
[222:50.77]Don't.
[222:52.23]Don't.
[222:53.01]There was a Charlton Heston movie.
[222:58.27]It's made out of people.
[222:59.31]It's fucking Soylent Green.
[223:01.07]It's made out of people.
[223:01.98]That's what makes it badass, Jerma.
[223:04.32]It tastes like a... It tastes like a liquid pretzel.
[223:12.22]Like you're just drinking a pretzel.
[223:14.16]Like salty?
[223:16.16]I've only managed to do like three sips and then I just set it aside and leave it out.
[223:22.14]What is it like a nutrition shake or something?
[223:24.60]Like protein?
[223:27.49]How much we've been winning?
[223:31.67]It's like something where the guy's just like, wouldn't it be great if you didn't have to eat anymore?
[223:35.63]You could just drink all of like the daily nutrition you need so you don't have to eat anymore.
[223:42.85]Don't you want to drink the stuff that comes out of the androids in the alien movies?
[223:47.59]Yeah, that's like the dystopian, like, humanity is over stuff.
[223:52.90]That's the stuff that the aliens feed us to keep us around.
[223:55.66]Exactly, yeah.
[223:56.28]So we can, like, build their ships and stuff.
[223:59.68]We made it taste like pretzel.
[224:05.65]Take a sip.
[224:10.39]This stream is sponsored by Soylent.
[224:12.89]No, it's not.
[224:15.17]Soylent.
[224:18.02]Just give up.
[224:19.68]Or it's like, reminds me of the stuff that's in every single, like, middle school movie.
[224:23.94]It's like the big fat lunch lady puts the sludge on the plate.
[224:26.94]Yeah.
[224:27.86]Are you sick of eating real food?
[224:31.92]Yeah, eat this weird alien lunch lady goo.
[224:34.22]Two, one.
[224:40.70]Don't know about that I'm coming Anybody else
[225:01.05]This guy's voice isn't good either
[225:23.11]Oh my god, I didn't have a sword.
[225:24.55]Shit.
[225:26.75]It's hard for me to find a person right now that isn't a tank.
[225:32.61]Dammit.
[225:32.95]This is not good.
[225:39.47]We're finally losing.
[225:40.87]I don't know, we're losing.
[225:43.49]What do we do?
[225:45.29]Do we not- Let's go win.
[225:46.21]Well, we don't have one of those things that they have.
[225:48.03]Uh oh.
[225:48.84]Yeah, they have two tanks, we have zero.
[226:01.83]I'm terrible.
[226:02.43]Eevee?
[226:10.63]And they have that one character that's pretty good.
[226:12.40]Vanessa, I should go kill her.
[226:33.43]Hey, good night, guys, that are just sticking around for a little bit.
[226:35.79]Zeno.
[226:36.21]Yeah, I'm spoofing and goofing this game.
[226:38.85]I'm going to have to step my gamer gear up.
[226:45.09]That's not good.
[226:46.43]Why don't you get you some gamer grub?
[226:49.29]I'm gonna.
[226:51.11]Ain't gonna work.
[226:55.69]Damn it, man.
[227:00.78]I can't do anything.
[227:06.80]There's like turrets everywhere and there's the slowdown things everywhere I fly.
[227:31.02]Gonna have to go Wrecker.
[227:33.34]Or, uh... Ogre.
[227:42.84]I have an ult.
[227:43.36]I healed you.
[227:44.24]Should probably use it.
[227:45.20]Thank you.
[227:45.94]Okay.
[227:48.08]She does a couple damage with her shots.
[227:49.68]I want her to.
[227:54.97]I'll remember this.
[227:59.57]You know the name of this record.
[228:01.04]That's really good.
[228:04.32]Really impressive.
[228:05.12]Thank you.
[228:09.48]Is anybody on the cart?
[228:16.46]No.
[228:16.84]I hit the wrong button.
[228:21.47]She just like appeared next to me and I hit the wrong fucking button.
[228:25.09]Could you not do that?
[228:26.13]This is do or die.
[228:27.47]I know.
[228:27.93]I did.
[228:28.91]I was doing fine.
[228:29.65]I killed like two people.
[228:30.27]We have so much on the line in this game.
[228:35.55]Verica went into the... No tanks, all banks.
[228:39.52]30 seconds remaining.
[228:49.40]Holy shit, I did nothing.
[228:50.34]You gotta stop screaming, you're making me sound nervous.
[228:55.83]I was around the corner, so far around the corner.
[229:00.11]Don't worry, I have an ult.
[229:03.35]I can use my ult.
[229:04.14]Oh my god, I'm throwing so hard!
[229:05.98]I'm just throwing so hard, I guess.
[229:10.08]And I can ult him on point.
[229:13.40]Was my ult just not hitting anyone?
[229:35.97]I killed two.
[229:38.15]That's not enough.
[229:39.69]That's not enough.
[229:41.65]I was so out of the whack there.
[229:49.79]Out of the whack.
[229:52.73]Listen to yourself.
[229:53.45]Out of the whack.
[230:06.49]I'm going to get super toxic here.
[230:08.66]Wish I was... I don't know.
[230:11.88]I just feel like they have a perfect team to annoy me on Eevee.
[230:18.48]Do we have... I guess we barely have a healer, right?
[230:21.56]Wow.
[230:25.18]Pip's a healer.
[230:28.98]Well, no, I'm just... We don't have anyone that can stand on point.
[230:41.79]Really?
[230:42.27]Two go that way?
[230:48.89]No, you're doing good heals, but doesn't Pip only have a little flask every ten seconds?
[230:53.45]No, you can get it.
[230:54.60]The hard thing is that I can't follow you guys around for heals since you're Flinkers.
[230:59.70]Yeah, we just have a bad team.
[231:02.00]Me and Starr, I'm bad.
[231:03.42]Starr might be doing okay.
[231:12.23]My god.
[231:14.61]Well, I can't do a goddamn fucking thing.
[231:24.00]Expectations met.
[231:27.95]I've been playing fine this whole time.
[231:30.93]Just not this game.
[231:42.37]What?
[231:42.95]It pushed me off.
[231:52.24]Need heals on point!
[231:54.22]I'm good.
[231:54.52]I have my ult.
[231:55.58]What goes on point?
[232:01.23]What goes on point?
[232:09.46]Fuckin' everybody's on point all of a sudden.
[232:12.26]We like all disappeared and it's just you and I even disappearing and it's my fault.
[232:18.51]Gonna turn them into chickens when they go out?
[232:24.53]Yeah.
[232:25.77]I would've liked some chickening.
[232:26.88]Holy shit.
[232:33.54]That has a lot of people.
[232:49.59]She'll remember that once she's dead.
[232:51.07]Shovel the stealth character.
[232:52.75]Coming around the right side.
[232:54.39]She's stealthy.
[233:04.21]You're the best.
[233:07.52]Wall shot, air shot, I heal.
[233:13.04]I... How the fuck did I die so quickly?
[233:15.48]I don't know.
[233:18.90]Is it because Skye's in the game?
[233:20.77]Yeah, probably.
[233:24.99]This is a real rootin' tootin'er.
[233:26.79]I'm dead.
[233:37.46]Oh, I'm so dead.
[233:39.48]Oh, you're right.
[234:01.15]A real rootin'er and a real tootin'er.
[234:03.43]Fuck.
[234:12.30]Ugh.
[234:14.40]How did you get back here?
[234:16.17]Oh, they're everywhere.
[234:17.59]They're just everywhere.
[234:18.41]What?
[234:18.79]I... I was... I was teleporting.
[234:22.99]It dies so much when I'm teleporting.
[234:25.37]Bye-bye.
[234:25.55]This is like a big ol' delay.
[234:30.21]Defeat.
[234:31.43]Hey, we lost the first game of the entire time we've been playing.
[234:35.81]Oh, well.
[234:36.05]I don't think we had a healer.
[234:38.73]Well, we did.
[234:39.73]I still won.
[234:40.41]I still won.
[234:41.21]All you two lost, I still won.
[234:44.39]We didn't have... They had two tanks.
[234:45.97]We didn't have one.
[234:46.77]No problem.
[234:52.36]I should have played like a beefy character or something.
[234:56.00]Time's ticking.
[235:01.39]I got a lot of damage.
[235:10.17]Yeah, I was... I kept getting picked off.
[235:12.09]I wasn't doing much.
[235:12.79]I'll do one more.
[235:22.70]You guys down for another one?
[235:23.62]One more?
[235:23.84]I don't know.
[235:25.68]Are we going to have a healer this time?
[235:27.34]Hopefully.

[241:56.33]I guess?
[242:03.01]I'm just, you know, I'm being, uh, being the cart girl.
[242:08.19]I'm just going for super shots.

[242:15.93]Hey, guys.
[242:17.07]Oh, yeah, watch this one.
[242:18.81]I'm going to do every move, every cooldown.
[242:23.69]Sorry.
[242:24.09]Okay, we actually have a McCaw on the point now.
[242:35.60]That is the loudest ult in the fucking game.
[242:40.92]Oh my god.
[242:42.24]It's not even that his voice is bad, it's just so loud.
[242:45.55]It's both, it's both, it's both, it's both.
[242:50.91]It fills up both of my ears.
[242:55.22]What?
[242:57.84]Oh, he's better than you.
[243:00.22]I got a Tripola kill.
[243:02.36]I pushed the cart, so I'm not even in the running for this.
[243:04.44]I got a shotgun.
[243:09.65]The hit sound is louder than the gun shooting.
[243:21.28]Most damage from the cart.
[243:22.96]Most damage from the cart.
[243:24.80]Look at that objective.
[243:27.38]You're probably just shooting the shields all the time.
[243:30.28]Yeah, we'll do one more.
[243:31.54]You were shooting the Mei Ice Wall.
[243:32.88]That's what you were doing.
[243:34.85]I would've.
[243:35.97]One more.
[243:40.13]Unomas.
[243:40.95]Final one, and then I want to eat something too.
[243:43.27]You made me hungry.
[243:44.25]Talk about tuna casserole.
[243:45.25]Now I want something.
[243:47.33]We weren't really talking about tuna and the terms of food for a while there.
[243:51.97]Oh, well now he wants some!
[243:53.39]He's gonna go get it!
[243:54.33]Now I'm gonna get it!
[243:55.91]Alright!
[243:56.13]Roar!
[243:56.73]Go get it, Joe!
[243:57.63]Alright!
[243:58.07]Roar on demand!
[244:00.88]Roar!
[244:01.20]Roar!
[244:03.18]Just go out in the ocean and get some.
[244:08.26]Where it lives.
[244:08.70]Steve, what are you gonna eat?
[244:14.39]Uh, after this game.
[244:17.05]What?
[244:18.33]After this game.
[244:19.41]What?
[244:19.63]What are you going to eat?
[244:23.03]After this game.
[244:24.14]What?
[244:24.88]It's pretty late.
[244:25.54]I haven't streamed in a while.
[244:28.34]The last three hours just disappeared.
[244:30.20]Have you only been playing Paladins today?
[244:32.68]Yeah.
[244:33.18]Oh, wow.
[244:37.97]All 90 hours, dude.
[244:39.63]Next.
[244:43.61]I got a plan for Thursday.
[244:44.91]We'll have fun on Thursday.
[244:47.77]What?
[244:49.77]Just remember, they have, like, some big Paladins tournament.
[244:53.05]I had fun in the other game, too, but it just... I read the Expo tournament or something like that.
[244:56.70]Yeah, they did.
[245:01.04]I was not in time.
[245:02.26]But Thursday and Friday should be good.
[245:03.98]Should be really fun.
[245:08.00]You'll see.
[245:12.00]No fun today.
[245:12.84]No, I had fun today.
[245:14.92]I was actually enjoying my time in Citizen Kabuto.
[245:25.96]Giants is a 10 times better game than Paladins.
[245:28.20]I'm feeling Cassie.
[245:29.88]I wanted a Cassie game, but I don't think I played the last game.
[245:33.32]Star was playing it.
[245:34.28]Tag wanted to play it.
[245:35.12]He could jump in with a few friends.
[245:36.74]I haven't done it in a while.
[245:41.57]10 seconds remaining.
[245:42.55]I don't think he is.
[245:45.27]We need a support.
[245:45.85]We need a tank.
[245:46.27]We need a support.
[245:46.75]We need a tank.
[245:47.63]Is this a tank?
[245:48.75]That is not a tank.
[245:49.67]How do I get off?
[245:50.45]Yeah, that's pretty much it.
[245:52.08]Okay, we got you.
[245:52.82]Now we don't have a support.
[245:57.74]Wait, this guy was a full-on tank, right?
[246:00.06]Did they remove all of his... Wasn't this guy a tank?
[246:03.80]He's tanky, but he's not a tank.
[246:05.92]He's a flanker.
[246:07.36]We have two flankers.
[246:09.44]We have two Flinkers, two DPS, and a tank.
[246:11.86]Well, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[246:13.50]So time to get a life rip or kill to heal.
[246:17.40]I don't even know what this fucking guy does.
[246:18.58]I'm here to kick butt and chew bubble gum.
[246:21.26]And properly dispose of the gum in the designated waste container.
[246:23.92]I'm gonna get life rip.
[246:26.49]Okay.
[246:26.77]Your guy can heal himself, though.
[246:28.63]Oh, cool.
[246:29.71]He has an ability that can heal himself.
[246:33.19]Okay, right click is enough.
[246:34.95]One more.
[246:36.09]He has the Hercules heal.
[246:37.19]Okay.
[246:41.91]Now he has a jump.
[246:43.22]The guy on the other team is named Optimus Yugi boy.
[246:46.18]He's gonna recover his giant jump.
[246:52.30]Alright.
[246:56.75]I'll build tank.
[246:57.45]That guy is so high.
[246:59.45]Time to be a flanker.
[247:11.52]I'm gonna... I don't want to burst your Bumble, Jerma, but... You bought Blast Shields, and Blast Shield only negates, like, explosive damage.
[247:20.54]Yeah, it's not a good thing.
[247:22.16]They don't have any explosive characters.
[247:25.89]Oh, really?
[247:26.29]What, did you see what I just did?
[247:27.99]Good thing I had that Blast Damage reduction.
[247:31.41]Get out of my personal space!
[247:43.54]That poor turtle.
[247:44.84]I always feel bad about killing Makoas.
[247:48.73]Why?
[247:49.01]These are the slow turtles trying to wobble away.
[248:10.07]Dude, get air shat!
[248:12.83]You didn't mean to hit that.
[248:28.30]Turtle you just don't like killing animals or no, it's just like everyone just groups up around and which is like kicks him in the face That guy just Yeah
[248:55.15]Dammit.
[248:55.89]Wait, he's setting emote?
[249:01.35]More pew-pew.
[249:01.91]Oh boy.
[249:03.57]Woah.
[249:26.57]Damn it.
[249:27.01]I would have got that shot.
[249:27.77]It would have been play of the game.
[249:28.69]It would have been awesome.
[249:30.11]But now it's like even if it is, it's not even cool.
[249:33.21]Well, because he like slithered out of the air and I couldn't air shot him.
[249:35.83]It's just lame.
[249:38.17]Like it's not even a fun game anymore.
[249:39.76]Like we should all just like stop playing it.
[249:41.88]Just because of that moment.
[249:44.28]I gotta be honest, I was not paying attention.
[249:45.96]What's it complaining about?
[249:46.80]Jeremiah, I used to watch Albiot packs as we get every single day and it died in crossfire.
[249:51.17]Oh, this is a new copy and paste.
[249:52.35]We should let them win a round.
[249:53.37]This is a new copy and paste.
[249:57.52]I don't want it to be over, but I do.
[249:59.12]Because I gotta eat.
[250:01.63]That's funny.
[250:02.41]What do you want to eat?
[250:02.94]I used to watch it every day and it got caught in the crossfire.
[250:06.38]This guy is looking at your deck.
[250:11.22]Don't start spamming.
[250:16.84]Are we letting them win or no?
[250:18.72]Don't say it like that.
[250:21.80]That makes us sound like such pretentious assholes.
[250:23.66]Who isn't letting them win?
[250:24.64]We're going to strategically take a loss here.
[250:30.00]to prolong the friend game.
[250:34.08]Ow, what the... You should be okay.
[250:41.49]Molotov core!
[250:45.55]Like, we're not winning enough?
[250:48.43]Apparently we're not.
[251:00.49]I thought we were deliberately playing poorly.
[251:03.83]Were we?
[251:05.31]I wasn't.
[251:05.95]Oh, I thought that was like the thing.
[251:09.83]That's the excuse.
[251:10.67]That's like a hindsight excuse.
[251:12.15]You were just doing it anyway.
[251:14.07]He ain't gonna get away.
[251:16.52]99% capital plan.
[251:30.94]So you let him dream and then you took it away from him.
[251:33.10]That's the real problem.
[251:39.52]Never let him dream.
[251:40.46]Why didn't he even try and... I was waiting for him to try and block me.
[252:00.31]Where's the support?
[252:03.17]Oh my god, you're typing up a storm.
[252:15.48]100% on me.
[252:17.42]That is a storm typer.
[252:20.34]Heals on me?
[252:21.72]Screw pushing the cart, I'm always the good guy.
[252:32.39]Time to frag out.
[252:34.33]Oh, wait, I have to push the cart.
[252:39.31]Damn it.
[252:39.79]I have to be this guy.
[252:43.48]That's what I get for not pushing the cart.
[252:44.94]I'm dead now.
[252:45.64]I look like a fool on my own stream.
[252:48.84]Well, here goes the KDR.
[253:18.82]You trick us to not touch the part.
[253:21.26]Then I get to play more before dinner.
[253:23.44]Get on it.
[253:23.72]Get on it.
[253:25.36]I'm just saying.
[253:26.42]Damn.
[253:29.59]Does River want more money?
[253:33.63]No.
[253:36.87]Get on it.
[253:49.93]Aw, Tag.
[253:51.65]Tag got it.
[253:52.16]What is it?
[253:52.44]See, I got screwed out of my play of the game.
[253:56.32]Nice.
[253:56.86]Good shot.
[254:01.44]She was completely invisible on my screen.
[254:02.92]I totally missed that.
[254:05.55]Look at that.
[254:08.03]Oh my goodness.
[254:11.58]Jump into a ceiling.
[254:12.50]That was a glitch.
[254:14.10]Yeah, it was a glitch.
[254:15.38]I believe you.
[254:15.98]Okay, well, it was fun playing with you guys.
[254:17.80]I have to go eat Lunchables.
[254:20.43]Take it easy, man.
[254:23.37]All my wife will get me is Lunchables.
[254:26.93]Oh my god.
[254:28.11]Gonna get those delivered?
[254:30.01]Yeah.
[254:30.94]Alright, well, if you're gonna get Lunchables, you gotta, uh, you gotta do the old school lunch table trick here.
[254:38.54]Alright.
[254:39.46]I'm not eating your tuna.
[254:40.68]No, no, you eat the whole thing.
[254:41.51]You stack them all up and you eat it all in one bite.
[254:44.96]No.
[254:45.89]Does anyone have a big enough mouth for that?
[254:47.77]That's what people used to do at the lunch table.
[254:49.13]It'd be like, check out this stack.
[254:50.51]And somebody would do cheese, bologna, cracker, cheese, bologna, cracker.
[254:54.17]Bang, that's gone.
[254:55.39]Somebody down on the other side of the table, oh, whoa, so fucking cool, dude.
[254:59.31]A fucking quadruple stack.
[255:00.45]He's got, like, it's eight inches tall.
[255:04.38]You gonna try to beat that guy?
[255:05.78]So these kids were fitting eight inches into their mouth at the lunch tables.
[255:12.48]Huh?
[255:14.95]Hey, you're horrible.
[255:16.49]I can't believe you'd say that on Jerma's stream, because Ster left.
[255:20.57]Oh, fucking star is gone.
[255:21.97]That only came through on my stream.
[255:24.23]Inappropriate.
[255:25.55]Absolutely revolting.
[255:26.55]Disgusting.
[255:27.85]Yep, losing followers.
[255:29.07]Streaming out the door.
[255:30.31]I'm out.
[255:30.71]I'm out.
[255:31.13]Thanks for playing, Tag.
[255:32.91]And bye, Ashley.
[255:34.23]Bye-bye.
[255:35.58]What the fuck was that?
[255:36.80]That was just, like, extremely inappropriate.
[255:46.88]I'll never play with that fucking guy again.
[255:52.82]Um... No, but thanks, everybody, for watching.
[255:56.12]Uh... What am I... I'm doing a lot of clapping.
[255:57.76]I'm doing, like, a... You know what I mean?

[256:01.31]Uh... Thank you, 4RealDoe, for the two bucks.
[256:04.25]I thought you might like to know I got your Dork Cube video featured on a Cryotic stream.

[256:21.99]But... Oh, yeah.
[256:24.93]The... What was I going to say?
[256:29.37]Yeah.
[256:29.77]We split two games.
[256:30.71]I just wanted to... I would have stayed in Kabuto and just kept playing it.
[256:34.11]Because there were some funny things that were happening.
[256:35.39]It was like a fun game.
[256:38.22]But...
[256:40.63]I haven't had like a stream a video game with friends type deal in a long time.
[256:47.47]So this was fun enough to do.
[256:52.55]But that's going to be it.
[256:54.57]I will see you guys on Thursday.
[256:57.32]And I got something planned for Thursday.
[257:00.56]And Friday.
[257:03.18]Take it easy guys.
[257:03.96]Thanks everybody for sticking around.
[257:06.74]Sorry for the technical difficulties in the beginning of the stream.
[257:09.49]It was kind of stupid, but... Good night.
[257:13.13]Goodbye.
[257:13.47]I'm going to change over from here.
[257:16.47]Have a good rest of your day.
[257:22.19]If this video is going to work.
[257:24.09]I don't know why it isn't.
[257:27.05]Oh, I know why it's not working.
[257:30.11]Because it's not here anymore.
[257:33.99]Hold on.
[257:34.59]I'll get it for you.
[257:38.03]How do I exit this fucking game?
[257:39.32]Oh, the giant little X in the corner.
[257:40.62]Okay.
[257:46.46]Where does it go?
[257:52.33]Wait, what?
[257:53.57]Wait, what?
[257:57.24]There it is.
