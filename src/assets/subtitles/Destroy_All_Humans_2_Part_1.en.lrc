[00:02.57]Hey.
[00:06.20]Hi.
[00:10.64]Welcome to another edition of Guy in Front of His Computer.
[00:14.86]My name's Jeremy.
[00:15.48]Welcome to the Tuesday version of this gathering.
[00:22.17]Hope you all brought sacrifices.
[00:26.03]And by sacrifices, I mean hope you all brought something for the potluck, because we've got a big dinner for us.
[00:30.55]Hold on.
[00:30.83]Let me close these windows.
[00:35.04]I always close my windows.
[00:37.00]Because I'm terrified of my neighbors hearing me scream.
[00:40.37]Or say something insane.
[00:42.45]But then there's no AC in here.
[00:45.29]So it just gets sweltering in it.
[00:47.47]Then I have to open the windows.
[00:54.30]But yeah, Destroy All Humans 2 tonight.
[00:57.52]I cannot promise we're going to complete this whole game.
[01:01.10]But I did want to at least try it.
[01:04.81]Destroy All Humans 1 was fun.
[01:06.19]This is kind of just... From my understanding, this is just a much better version of the first game.
[01:13.93]We're going to try it?
[01:16.69]I don't know.
[01:17.60]We'll see if there's going to be another couple streams on this.
[01:19.96]Might be.
[01:21.72]Yeah, we're starting a little early today.
[01:25.64]Because... I'm around and... I've got stuff to do later.
[01:30.92]Especially into tomorrow.
[01:35.20]Don't ever, like, live in a house.
[01:36.62]You know what I mean?
[01:38.92]Just, like, get a car and fill it with a bed.
[01:43.30]Drive around your house car.
[01:45.79]It's so much easier.
[01:47.69]Just go to a Walmart parking lot, put it into park, just roll back and go to bed and just wake up and drive somewhere else.
[02:01.65]You know, I thought about, like, living in the van life.
[02:03.71]That, like, that's not actually even that bad.
[02:07.27]That sounds, like, kind of cool.
[02:08.63]At least for a little while.
[02:10.35]If you bought an RV and just drove around to open parking lots and just slept in it... Now, this is something I would never do, but... Seems interesting.
[02:27.57]Internet becomes an issue.
[02:28.63]Not if you get... Not if you get HughesNet!
[02:31.36]That's satellite internet.
[02:34.49]I mean, it's pretty shitty.
[02:36.11]It does not have that much speed, but you could have a HughesNet account.
[02:39.49]And just drive around and have like a mobile hotspot forever.
[02:46.80]HughesNet sucks.
[02:47.80]Well, it doesn't matter at that point.
[02:49.42]You're like a driving cell phone tower at that point.
[02:54.20]HughesNet is one megabyte with data caps.
[03:01.26]Holy shit, that's awful.
[03:06.38]That's a good streamer idea.
[03:10.79]Your phone's LTE is faster.
[03:12.57]Well, then, yeah, whatever.
[03:14.71]Just supercharge it with extra antennas on the roof of your car.
[03:17.71]Alright, let's go.
[03:21.43]We're gonna start.
[03:23.27]Destroy all humans, too.
[03:24.11]Hope you guys are having a good day.
[03:27.42]I'm having a pretty good day.
[03:28.72]I'm nice and relaxed right now.
[03:33.38]And here we go.
[03:35.42]Picking off right where we left off a few weeks ago.
[03:40.02]Destroy all humans too.
[03:42.98]How's my spine?
[03:43.88]It's still hurt.
[03:44.44]My back is always causing me problems.
[03:45.87]Don't ask me why.
[03:46.43]Alright.
[03:51.96]Haven't even loaded the menu yet.
[03:53.08]This is the first time I've ever seen it.
[03:54.70]I'm looking forward to it.
[03:56.87]Comrade agents, thank you for coming.
[03:59.73]Here's what we know so far.
[04:01.25]This is Robert Ackendown.
[04:02.69]Ten years ago, the United States government covered up an invasion by an alien race known as Furons.
[04:11.00]Dead.
[04:11.16]No, it's not a clone.
[04:12.14]Did I finish one?
[04:13.74]Yeah, we beat all of one.
[04:36.12]A couple weeks ago.
[04:38.48]The American people are not noticing?
[04:42.43]That's a lot of money.
[04:43.23]After the cutscene, I will address that large donation there.
[04:47.90]Thank you.
[05:12.79]So the first game's about America, second game's about the USSR.
[05:18.86]The United States of Soviet Russia.
[05:21.70]What does it stand for?
[05:22.32]What does the USSR stand for?
[05:23.34]President Krypto is in Bay City attending a youth cultural festival.
[05:27.64]And Orthopox?
[05:29.10]Conducting experiments in the Furon mothership.
[05:32.20]You're in sample Soviet Russia.
[05:38.07]Savages.
[05:39.17]Degenerates.
[05:43.17]There's only one way to kill such men.
[05:46.91]Oh, that's it.
[05:48.23]What in the... Revolution!
[05:50.63]This is too loud.
[05:51.73]Oh, it's loud.
[05:52.82]Turn it down.
[05:55.50]Uh-oh.
[05:57.30]That can't be good.
[05:59.88]I'm back, baby.
[06:00.82]It's me.
[06:01.30]Greetings, comrade.
[06:03.02]Mother Russia sends her regards.
[06:05.98]You expect me to pay, human?
[06:09.37]No, little Furon.
[06:11.03]I expect you to die.
[06:14.94]Do I have to pull the trigger here?
[06:22.11]Do I have to right click?
[06:23.65]Or right trigger on this guy?
[06:29.17]I'm ready.
[06:31.09]Oh, I actually agree.
[06:35.78]Kill the KGB agents!
[06:38.81]Right analog stick to aim.
[06:40.73]There's another one right there.
[06:43.73]I played the first game.
[06:44.47]You don't think I know how the fucking controls go?
[06:46.64]I like how the health bar is actually on the, uh... The resectakil, you know what I mean?
[06:56.28]Alright, everything... Are all the other controls the same too?
[07:01.25]Who's... What is going on?
[07:02.27]Who's raining hell down right now?
[07:03.93]Us?
[07:08.80]There he is.
[07:12.58]Oh, the mothership.
[07:15.76]Oh, I don't have a jetpack!
[07:19.56]I can't jump over bushes, I'm too small.
[07:24.62]Don't forget the bits.
[07:25.77]Yep, you are absolutely correct.
[07:27.93]So, uh, Scripps3, thank you so much for your $50.
[07:31.47]50 bucks.
[07:35.56]And they say, Jerma, I did a bingo card for your streams.
[07:39.12]Here it is.
[07:40.60]Let's go over this.
[07:41.63]You have a bingo card for me.
[07:46.69]Alright, well, let's see.
[07:47.91]You guys want to play Jeremy Bingo?
[07:49.89]$100, Jerma dies right at the end of a mission debated by chat.
[08:00.50]Should I just like put this on the screen?
[08:08.33]I mean, like, you made this.
[08:14.61]You guys have to tell me when I do.
[08:16.63]Alright.
[08:17.01]I feel like you guys are going to get bingo in like 15 minutes.
[08:22.23]I'll put it on screen.
[08:23.61]You know, that sounds like fun.
[08:25.49]Let's just put it on screen.
[08:28.20]Thank you so much, Scripps, for obviously the bingo.
[08:31.90]And I actually, I'm not going to look at this too intently because I don't want to know like what these are.
[08:39.06]So I don't want to like stare at this and like do them unless I would put my own money on the game and then I could just win a lot of money.
[08:45.24]Alright, here we go.
[08:48.16]Let's get it on screen of the middle card, by the way.
[08:52.55]We're going to put this somewhere where it's not in the way, though.
[08:58.93]Where can I put this?
[09:02.41]Like, this is not gonna work out.
[09:06.85]Okay, we need to take this down.
[09:10.71]Can you guys see this?
[09:17.84]This can't go anywhere.
[09:19.36]This is like too big.
[09:24.32]Can you guys still see that?
[09:27.06]Is that alright right there?
[09:31.44]That's probably alright.
[09:33.93]Okay, you guys have to keep me up to date on this.
[09:38.01]Okay, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:38.71]You guys have your own version, right?
[09:40.47]Like, if you want to play along, just do it.
[09:42.74]Because, like, you guys can be able to see the dots eventually.
[09:44.86]That's fine.
[09:47.32]Like, this is just for you to be able to see which ones are taken.
[09:50.66]You got your own card.
[09:51.76]You don't need to see it on the screen.
[09:54.55]Make my facecam the middle.
[09:58.65]God fucking damn it.
[09:59.63]When you have a good idea, you mean you got a good idea.
[10:24.61]I already hate this.
[10:28.83]I gotta get it, like, in the right spot.
[10:34.20]Am I just gonna sit here and taunt you guys?
[10:35.56]Like, come on!
[10:36.66]Come on!

[11:01.17]Wait, that's not a weird voice.

[16:17.13]And yeah, I did make a weird noise earlier.
[16:18.81]You know what?
[16:21.83]Just make sure I don't do any of these things for the next 10 minutes.
[16:31.29]I have to like resize all of these.
[16:38.19]Just pull the whole thing down.
[16:41.84]Why can I not grab them all?
[16:43.16]I'm ignoring the game's story.
[16:54.59]No, I'm desperately trying.
[16:56.95]This has to stay like this.
[16:58.93]Hope you have your monitor scaled.
[17:00.77]Hold on.
[17:06.50]Okay, we have to do it like this for a few minutes.
[17:11.47]Okay, I'm ready.
[17:15.09]Your current girls are marked on the radar as pink markers.
[17:20.75]Use your radar to find them.
[17:21.95]Alright, let's go.
[17:31.62]Look, you just have to just be quiet.
[17:35.22]Be quiet.
[17:36.78]Oh, Ashbury, more like Schnoshbury.
[17:43.80]Where do I have to go over here?
[17:53.76]The sound is not muted.
[17:55.14]The sound is not fucking muted.
[17:57.46]I checked.
[17:58.76]I can lift this up.
[18:10.29]No, no.
[18:12.01]No, we're not doing next game.
[18:14.55]Why are we doing next game?
[18:15.90]Stop it.
[18:18.38]We just opened this one.
[18:19.70]Are you guys serious?
[18:26.22]Got him.
[18:26.68]You got what I mean?
[18:27.24]Got him.
[18:27.57]You didn't do anything.
[18:36.09]Refuses to change.
[18:37.29]God, you fucking assholes.
[18:42.24]Where?
[18:42.70]Oh, look, I got you baited.
[18:44.56]Oh, look at that.
[18:45.48]What else happened?
[18:46.90]Dribble refuses to fucking change the game the chat wants.
[18:52.68]Where is it?
[18:57.43]Uh... What?
[19:03.23]Well, I don't even know where it is.
[19:06.71]Am I this stupid?
[19:16.35]Oh, we're right here.
[19:18.41]Nobody has a bingo yet, right?
[19:19.53]Okay, I'm ready.
[19:24.94]Let's go.
[19:25.34]Keep going.
[19:27.54]Nobody has a bingo yet.
[19:31.99]All I have to do is make sure I don't say something about my behind area.
[19:36.17]I just can't say anything about where the shit comes out of your bum.
[19:42.60]No, I did not say it Because I was I was explaining a concept I actually didn't say No, I'm not ignore I can hear the story right now, I'll take a recap I
[20:12.32]They're playing chess, and now he's moving rook one to bishop two.
[20:15.92]Fuck you.
[20:16.36]No, that was not bad.
[20:17.02]That was not a badly explained concept.
[20:19.84]Oh my fucking god, whatever.
[20:42.17]None of you guys have bingo yet, so it doesn't matter.
[20:44.05]Alright, I gotta talk to Arkvedal.
[20:53.49]That lady just got run over by the car.
[20:54.75]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out!
[20:57.05]Don't do the crab walk backwards, she's gonna get crushed.
[21:00.95]Alright.
[21:05.25]So, welcome to the game.
[21:07.55]Uh, hope you guys had a good day today.
[21:12.79]Is that a clown?
[21:18.76]Alright, I gotta move this shit out of the way with my PK.
[21:24.30]Speaking of PK, let's PK this guy.
[21:27.96]Hey, get PK'd, buddy.
[21:31.01]What?
[21:31.33]You don't like that one?
[21:34.51]There's a problem with that one?
[21:44.60]Let's get my rook.
[21:49.04]Location of ancient Furon landing sites.
[21:53.39]And pick up the rook.
[21:59.63]Talk to Ark Voodle and satisfy his demands to unlock landing zones.
[22:02.77]Okay.
[22:03.05]I don't know why I killed that guy.
[22:13.85]You don't have bingo.
[22:23.92]Where am I moving to?
[22:25.12]I'm moving to somewhere on the... I'm moving somewhere.
[22:29.97]But that's for you to know and for me to find out.
[22:32.59]No, the other way around.
[22:33.31]That's for me to know and for you not to ever hear about it for the rest of the stream.
[22:39.96]First of all, 100 bucks from Stormichu.
[22:42.18]Thank you, dude.
[22:43.14]Thanks for putting the thing on the screen.
[22:46.67]Thank you so much for the $100, dude.
[22:47.87]And then StixRenegade with 50 bucks here.
[22:50.15]Thank you so much, guys.
[22:51.27]What's your favorite casino game, by the way?
[22:53.73]I don't... I don't... I don't know.
[22:55.45]I don't... I... It's off!
[23:01.27]Brain turn off!
[23:02.21]I don't... I don't know what that word is.
[23:06.48]I haven't talked about anything.
[23:09.55]Alright, what do you want me to do?
[23:10.59]I didn't talk about anything.
[23:11.69]I just said I don't know.
[23:13.19]How is that cheating?
[23:14.92]I didn't cheat at all.
[23:16.26]What did I do to cheat?
[23:39.88]What?
[23:40.08]I didn't... When did I cheat for this?
[23:45.89]I'm cheating at bingo.
[23:47.11]No, I'm not.
[23:49.61]Since when is me... How is that cheating?
[23:51.33]What's going on?
[23:54.27]Are these apples that come out of the garbage can?
[24:13.13]What kind of egomaniac makes his own bingo board?
[24:15.91]I didn't make this.
[24:18.17]I did not make this.
[24:19.35]This is just... And you know what?
[24:27.31]You know what?
[24:27.61]Alright.
[24:27.95]You know what?

[24:31.31]Right?
[24:31.53]There you go.
[24:32.19]Ding, ding, ding.
[24:32.83]It's over.
[24:37.03]There you go.
[24:37.89]It's over.
[24:39.55]Oh, what?
[24:40.31]Oh, shit.
[24:40.67]I spilled my drink.
[24:44.47]Somebody got oh you get you got bingo And I spilt the drink to maybe somebody else got it wait that wouldn't make any sense this is this whole board makes no sense Okay now get rid of it all And he cheated and he cheated Another hundred fucking dollars.
[25:04.88]What are you guys doing?
[25:08.80]Oh My goodness
[25:11.95]Alright, first of all, thank you AceMcLace for the 100 bucks.
[25:16.78]Much appreciated, man.
[25:18.40]This is like 300 fucking dollars in 10 minutes.
[25:22.02]You gotta be kidding me.
[25:23.18]Thank you, guys.
[25:25.42]Ace says, can't stick around, but I'm looking forward to watching the VOD.
[25:27.55]Hope everyone has a good time.
[25:29.09]Thank you, Ace.
[25:32.39]You are a very generous person.
[25:34.59]Thank you so much.
[25:35.37]All of you guys.
[25:35.73]Alright, let's get this off the screen because this is overstating its welcome.
[25:43.26]Now I gotta delete them.
[25:43.88]Hold on.
[25:44.04]This is gonna take a long time.
[25:48.81]This is... Okay, this is gonna take a long... I'm gonna have to go like this for a minute.
[25:53.23]Then we can go back to playing the game and destroy all humans too.
[25:56.01]Thank you for participating.
[25:56.87]But what I was gonna say is everyone's bingo board has to be different for this to work.
[26:00.92]You know what I mean?
[26:04.24]That's like... It doesn't work that way.
[26:12.61]But everyone will get bingo at the same time, then.
[26:14.59]You know what I mean?
[26:16.97]Alright, let's go.
[26:20.97]Talk to Pucks.
[26:24.69]Pester... Wait, they have actual dialog options now?
[26:40.33]Pester Pox for heavy weapons.
[26:41.77]Tell Pox to get the saw.
[26:43.05]Give me some heavy weapons, man.
[26:44.29]Don't tell him.
[26:45.65]Just don't tell him.
[26:47.25]Tell me what?
[26:47.77]You know, you shouldn't have said anything.
[26:50.81]God, you could have caught me, like, fucking putting my fingers up my nose.
[26:53.97]Or, like...
[27:09.17]sticking my fingers in my eyes and, like, licking my fingers.
[27:11.36]Why would I do that?
[27:12.20]I don't do that.
[27:12.76]But thank you so much, guys, for a lot of huge donations there.
[27:17.66]Thank you.
[27:18.12]Alright, let's go.
[27:34.35]Uh... Get the saucer ready.
[27:35.29]Don't tell him.
[27:35.73]Don't tell him.
[27:36.13]Play the pen and teller game?
[28:02.09]Penn and Teller had a video game?
[28:03.17]He doesn't know.
[28:03.75]There's nothing there.
[28:04.57]Alright, let's, uh, let's quiz him.
[28:06.73]A datacore is a device used for storing weapons or other furor technology.
[28:30.34]What kind of egomaniac has a bingo board for his own stream?
[28:35.74]Not me.
[28:37.56]That was just... That was a chat requested, so I put it on... You know what?
[28:41.71]There's no way I can spin that.
[28:45.49]I can't spin that to my favor.
[28:47.79]How do I, like, make that not a reality?
[28:49.29]Fucking, like, megalomaniac.
[29:00.07]Alright, let's get the data core.
[29:01.47]We can play destroy all humans.
[29:04.01]One, two.
[29:07.77]Destroy all humans.
[29:08.59]One, two.
[29:09.67]Hmm.
[29:10.31]How do I fly?
[29:14.82]Oh, you can use your jetpack to boost onto rooftops and move more quickly.
[29:19.38]Yes.
[29:20.14]Hold X. Keep holding X to glide down to the ground.
[29:26.16]Uh-huh.
[29:27.32]Alert up.
[29:27.90]Oh, fuck.
[29:28.37]Whoops.
[29:30.40]Whoa, the jetpack is way stronger in this game.
[29:32.58]I was not expecting a boost like that.
[29:34.04]That's actually kind of hard to control.
[29:41.25]One, two, three.
[29:43.89]Nope, I need to go in the water tower.
[29:46.35]Put the tiny cam back on.
[29:48.29]No, because that's like egomania.
[29:51.46]You got that like egomania shit stuck in my head now.
[29:57.12]Okay, guy wants to have his face on screen at all times.
[30:01.43]Like, think about that.
[30:03.15]I want you guys to look at my face.
[30:05.03]My face on screen at all times.
[30:08.11]The megalomania thing is gonna happen again.
[30:13.19]Uh, hold... Okay, this is a different way to open this.
[30:17.37]Hold square and move the left analog stick, so this is a different way to... When a disk is finished flying, it will appear inside the disk locator.
[30:24.68]Okay.
[30:31.64]This felt like me two days ago.
[30:34.30]I'm self-conscious.
[30:34.88]He just spit in that guy's face.
[30:36.80]This guy looks like my brother.
[30:51.01]Like a funny caricature of my brother.
[30:54.09]Like, you know how every president that's ever existed has, like, the extreme caricature that's always drawn on them?
[31:06.74]That would be my brother's version.
[31:08.10]Okay.
[31:17.68]By the way, how have binoculars not improved in technology?
[31:22.27]It's like just two pieces of glass.
[31:25.11]Do binoculars exist where you look in them and digitally there's this 500,000 times digital zoom?
[31:47.70]A camcorder is better than binoculars now.
[31:49.88]If you hold up your hand with a little Sony shitty $50 camcorder, it's better than a pair of binoculars.
[31:59.47]I'm just being serious.
[32:03.80]A telescope?
[32:04.40]Yeah, but you can't walk around with a telescope.
[32:07.40]That's false.
[32:08.12]No, it's not.
[32:09.99]Go stand on the shore of a beach and zoom in with a digital camera to the island that's really far away.
[32:14.96]You get much closer than like the four and a half times you get with optical.
[32:20.16]I mean, it's clearer, but you can't see it as well.
[32:35.52]Where's my bingo board?
[32:36.88]Do I get one too?
[32:38.70]Do I get a bingo board too?
[32:43.92]What the fuck?
[32:50.80]I like this much better.
[32:51.68]It actually pauses the game too.
[32:52.90]I'm going to try this.
[32:54.74]The Dislocator.
[33:01.65]Wait, what is he- brings him- oh, just throws him around?
[33:04.86]Oh, that's... That weapon is actually kind of dumb.
[33:20.16]No, I get the bingo board.
[33:21.20]Because where's my, like, Jerma Trolls 40,000 people?
[33:26.51]Where's my bingo board?
[33:30.07]Pox Mart is now open.
[33:31.15]I want to see what this actually does.
[33:35.83]Can I get more than one person?
[33:43.83]How high do they go?
[33:44.53]Oh, it just throws them the hell out of here, huh?
[33:51.70]Are there no brains in this one?
[33:53.04]No, I guess I don't have the brain sucker router thing yet.
[33:55.00]Alright.
[33:57.24]Let's see.
[33:57.70]What do I got?
[33:58.34]Can I refill here?
[34:01.09]Okay.
[34:01.93]At Poxmart, you can purchase upgrades for your weapons and jetpack.
[34:04.45]This is so much better than having to go to the main menu.
[34:07.99]Collect Furrotech cells to buy upgrades at Poxmart.
[34:14.70]Okay.
[34:16.30]Zap-O-Matic has a couple of trees.
[34:19.98]So you just have to get the cell.
[34:20.98]I guess there's no brains in this one.
[34:25.80]I guess you just have to collect them?
[34:29.03]Interestingly enough.
[34:29.79]Alright.
[34:30.33]There was one like literally right here.
[34:32.76]There's two right here.
[34:36.66]We made a bingo board for him, but he's not making one for us.
[34:40.36]Well, I didn't... I just... I got like 15 minutes notice.
[34:45.82]Furrotech cells are used to upgrade the pox.
[34:49.16]Yes.
[34:49.36]Alright.
[34:50.74]Can I get up there from here?
[34:52.22]I don't know if I can.
[34:56.07]Probably not, but it's worth a shot.
[35:01.60]No.
[35:02.60]Well, I want to get it.
[35:06.38]It's gonna be like a car or a truck or a device or something, right?
[35:09.88]On top of the telephone.
[35:10.66]It's the IRS.
[35:19.03]This new boost is hard to control, man.
[35:22.67]Oh, no.
[35:23.91]Shit.
[35:29.28]How do I get up there?
[35:29.88]Maybe get on this one and jump over?
[35:31.74]Is there a way to get... There we go.
[35:35.19]Okay, right here.
[35:36.43]Get two of these.
[35:39.69]Should be able to get it from here.
[35:46.36]Nope.
[35:47.76]I can't.
[35:48.20]Go fuck it.
[35:48.64]Let's go.
[35:49.02]Talk.
[35:52.78]Talk.
[35:53.60]Talk.
[35:54.80]Talk.
[35:56.57]Oh, I'm under fire.
[36:00.37]Have I ever streamed Lisa?
[36:01.33]No, I have not.
[36:03.22]Is this guy attacking me?
[36:09.76]This person's not attacking me.
[36:12.28]That would have been so funny if I just hit her head on the wall there.
[36:17.51]Let's go... No.
[36:21.01]There we go.
[36:21.41]Okay.
[36:21.79]Visit Holopox for your next mission.
[36:23.87]That was weird.
[36:24.41]That lady was attacking me.
[36:27.01]Jeez, Pox, my head's still spinning.
[36:30.24]What the hell's going on around here?
[36:32.94]Why are those Ruskies gunning for us?
[36:36.04]Frankly, I'm more concerned with how the KGB managed such a successful twin strike.
[36:41.21]They're not usually so organized.
[36:43.35]We need to find them, Crypto, before they spring any more surprises.
[36:49.95]Someone donate bits asking him to play Lisa.
[36:52.11]You don't have to do that.
[36:52.84]You can just say it right here.
[36:54.22]You can put it in the Discord.
[36:55.20]You don't have to pay me money to ask me to play a game.
[36:59.72]Uh, accuse the hippies of helping.
[37:01.02]Yeah, we finished the first one.
[37:03.18]Play Lisa.
[37:03.40]I'll consider it.
[37:15.81]That's something I will very gladly consider.
[37:17.87]Plus, I think I've actually already seen that before.
[37:26.88]Don't consider it.
[37:27.32]Play it.
[37:27.66]I'll consider it.
[37:43.87]Don't you know the easiest way to deflect any answer is to go, I'll look into that.
[37:48.39]That's like the politician one-on-one.
[37:50.95]I've got a team working on that.
[37:53.82]I've got a team looking into that.
[37:57.84]Jerma, can you please play XYZ?
[37:59.70]You know, I'll look into that.
[38:04.58]I'm just kidding.
[38:05.76]Oh, my God.
[38:06.32]That means he's not going to play it.
[38:16.08]Yeah, you know, I'll look into looking into that.
[38:20.61]I got a team.
[38:27.57]I already wrote a paragraph of why you should play Lisa on the Discord.
[38:36.42]I'll look into that.
[38:38.24]No, I will read it.
[38:39.28]I'm not kidding.
[38:39.95]I read that fucking Discord every day.
[38:47.40]I will.
[38:48.54]I promise.
[38:49.06]This rumor confirms to be lying to chat.
[38:54.79]Yeah, I'll turn the subtitles on.
[38:56.53]Thought they were already on.
[38:57.49]Sorry about that.
[39:16.22]Okay.
[39:17.90]Wish it accepted.
[39:19.28]Hippie.
[39:19.74]You hippie bastard.
[39:20.67]Can you play Minecraft?
[39:22.03]No.
[39:22.09]Where have all the flower children gone?
[39:25.05]Sounds good.
[39:25.51]Let's turn on the subtitles.
[39:45.42]Disguise yourself as the hippie chick.
[39:48.23]You can steal a human's body by using body snatch.
[39:51.95]Approach the human and rapidly press triangle to steal their body.
[39:56.13]This is a little different than the last game, but hold on.
[40:00.27]The nav map shows you the location of important people, places, and objects.
[40:03.31]Complete Arkvoodle cult missions and odd jobs to earn Furotech cells and other goodies.
[40:09.02]Okay, cool.
[40:09.80]So I just go up there.
[40:11.26]Okay, hold on.
[40:13.24]Let's get to the pause menu.
[40:15.98]Whoever the fuck that is.
[40:17.00]Alright, audio, yeah, yeah, yeah, that's fine.
[40:19.58]Display.
[40:20.56]Subtitles?
[40:21.32]On.
[40:21.68]Widescreen?
[40:22.50]On.
[40:24.76]Controls are fine.
[40:26.40]That should do it.
[40:31.02]Approach the human and then rapido.
[40:34.74]Oh, you actually go into their body this time.
[40:40.53]A human disguise is useless until you've taken care of the witnesses.
[40:44.26]You can use forget or free love to make the humans forget that they've seen you.
[40:49.16]Hold L1 to target a human while holding L1 rapidly plus circle to make the humans dance.
[40:53.81]This is so much different than the last one.
[41:03.21]Alright, I can sprint.
[41:04.63]Find the freak.
[41:10.68]You can gather information from humans by using your scan ability.
[41:13.64]While in body snatch mode, hold L1 and target a human.
[41:16.81]And then rapidly press X to scan like the last game.
[41:21.31]Okay.
[41:23.31]So, is there somebody in this?
[41:25.49]While in body snatch, hold L1 to target a human.
[41:27.48]It doesn't matter who it is.
[41:31.64]What's wrong with me?
[41:34.66]Can't find a girl.
[41:36.94]Oh, hold on.
[41:38.70]Okay.
[41:40.59]We found out where the freak is while holding L1, press X to... Yeah, now I got a location of a freak.
[41:50.77]Golden Gate Park.
[41:53.29]An area.
[41:53.83]It's up there.
[41:56.21]Sounds good.
[41:56.69]Why don't I go like this?
[41:58.05]Let me just yawn and yawn and yawn on this guy.
[42:00.34]Man, the freak was right on.
[42:02.14]Chicks dig the park.
[42:03.78]Gotta be the mushroom.
[42:05.87]Can I drive?
[42:09.65]Oh, I wish I could get in the car.
[42:11.47]This gets a full letter grade.
[42:17.11]I can't jump, though.
[42:20.33]You can sprint, but you can't jump.
[42:23.19]Although, how am I jumping?
[42:26.26]Excuse me.
[42:27.14]Pardon.
[42:27.66]Excuse me.
[42:30.94]The freak is supplying the whole damn commune at the park.
[42:33.92]And yet he still can't get any action.
[42:35.94]What a loser.
[42:37.70]No, whoops.
[42:38.60]Oh god, I just ripped out of her body.
[42:40.99]I just ace ventured out of that lady.
[42:50.61]What?
[42:51.07]I want to... Who is getting run over?
[42:52.77]I can go back in here, right?
[42:57.88]There we go.
[43:03.58]Clean snatch.
[43:06.02]Let's just walk out.
[43:06.90]Yeah, I know I have to go there, but how do I, like, I can't, like, jump.
[43:13.99]I can't walk anywhere.
[43:16.27]Do I have to just go back and talk to the fucking head here?
[43:21.11]Drop the human disguise to talk.
[43:23.03]I'm, like, literally stuck in here.
[43:32.70]Was that just teaching me how to do that?
[43:33.94]Can I do that to anybody?
[43:39.51]Well, I'm in the human snatch form.
[43:40.89]Can I still pick shit up and move it around?
[43:42.93]Apparently, maybe.
[43:43.69]I thought I had different options inside of human form, though.
[43:53.64]What just happened?
[43:55.32]What the fuck was that?
[43:57.12]Just come over here.
[43:57.86]I'm going to snatch the police officer.
[44:00.82]Get up.
[44:07.29]Can I?
[44:07.57]Okay, I can move when I'm a person.
[44:10.15]Alright, let's go.
[44:12.57]I'm running out of health with this dude.
[44:15.13]We gotta go up.
[44:20.23]I think does running hurt you more?
[44:21.31]Does running drop your ability to do things?
[44:23.30]Alright, I gotta bang a right here.
[44:32.84]This dude's gonna die.
[44:33.70]I'm gonna have to, like, tear out of this guy's esophagus in a second.
[44:36.37]You know, let's just do it now.
[44:41.49]No, I gotta get this off.
[44:45.13]I need to find one person to snatch.
[44:46.53]I need somebody with full health.
[44:49.53]Not this guy taking a forward shit.
[44:54.31]What's that?
[44:56.45]What is this?
[44:58.97]Is it a lantern or whatever?
[45:03.15]Here we go.
[45:03.43]Come here.
[45:06.75]Come here!
[45:07.09]Alright, now let's make everybody dance.
[45:13.40]No, no, no, no.
[45:13.92]I gotta scan.
[45:15.42]No, free love.
[45:16.30]It's circle.
[45:16.72]Here we go.
[45:17.64]We're good.
[45:19.40]Alright.
[45:23.30]They actually get out of their cars, too, for this.
[45:24.90]That's funny.
[45:25.33]Alright, here it is.
[45:27.81]How do you take a forward shit like they just did?
[45:34.45]Like the guy we were just looking at.
[45:35.45]Alright.
[45:35.75]We're at the park.
[45:38.39]What to do here?
[45:40.30]Looking for the freak.
[45:44.50]Anybody seen a freak?
[45:45.28]I'm assuming it's a guy in here.
[45:49.40]Well...
[46:05.56]Alright, Freak's over here.
[46:06.38]Imagine seeing that.
[46:13.28]Like, I got a good carrot top disguise.
[46:15.08]So now let's talk to the Freak.
[46:20.76]Hey there, uh, Moondoggy.
[46:23.60]I'm looking for a dude with his ear to the street.
[46:26.68]The kids call him the Freak.
[46:29.57]You found him?
[46:30.79]But I'm all tapped out, man.
[46:32.69]The heat's coming down on me, you know.
[46:34.67]Try me next week.
[46:40.00]I'm looking for guidance, Freak.
[46:41.54]Freak, in all your drug-induced visions, I'm sure you've gained much wisdom.
[46:49.71]I heard the freak can't stick to standard spring schedules.
[46:55.23]We're early.
[46:56.49]And look, I'm moving.
[47:00.57]I'm moving across the country.
[47:02.47]Look at your watch.
[47:04.34]Alright, what is that?
[47:07.20]Judge's duty, right?
[47:08.18]Ah, excuse you.
[47:10.32]Point, she's pointing.
[47:11.28]Alright, ask her to stay healthy.
[47:12.26]Now how do you get a woman into bed?
[47:15.00]Uh, got any tips for dealing with ladies?
[47:19.96]Why didn't he just turn into Bobcat Goldthwait?
[47:23.38]What was that for?
[47:24.79]He's doing Bobcat.
[47:26.47]Ha ha ha!
[47:49.57]Does anybody know who that is?
[47:50.63]Am I too old for this?
[47:53.18]I don't get it.
[47:53.88]Is it the tattoos?
[47:57.28]That's the guy from Police Academy, yeah.
[48:04.86]Let's say, for the sake of argument, that I cannot clone myself.
[48:11.08]How do I live a long and healthy life?
[48:15.12]Sex, sex, and more sex.
[48:17.35]And if you can't be with the one you love, honey, love the one you're with.
[48:22.41]Wow.
[48:23.73]You really are wise.
[48:25.25]This guy's fucked up.
[48:27.74]You're boring the love beads off of me here.
[48:30.84]Let's talk about something else.
[48:34.35]You know anything about Russia?
[48:35.59]Isn't this a chil- This is not a children's game.
[48:39.93]I mean, it's either Bobcat or it's Peewee Herman.
[48:57.85]invited the KGB to, uh, harsh our buzz.
[49:02.49]No, it's not a children's game.
[49:03.69]From what I hear, it was that cat who leads the commune.
[49:08.24]I don't know his real name, but he calls himself Coyote Pong Water, which is pretty righteous.
[49:15.68]He's doing, like, the high and low.
[49:16.62]Supposedly, he's, like, his master of tantric meditation and spiritual healing.
[49:21.56]Oh, I know his cat's got the chicks eaten out of his hookah.
[49:27.26]Actually, now that I think of it, it's not Peewee.
[49:28.72]Alright, where is his location?
[49:32.05]That's a Darksoul Invader's name.
[49:44.54]He's naked with like a fucking huge hammer.
[49:46.12]Alright, find some revelade.
[50:11.04]Alright.
[50:11.96]Where is it?
[50:14.24]He claims it's like an all-natural elixir that enhances your cosmic awareness or something.
[50:21.98]Bongwater says it's the first shot in the global revolution against the man.
[50:27.68]Great.
[50:28.68]Great.
[50:29.60]Like the monkeys aren't revolting enough already.
[50:33.65]Thanks, freak.
[50:34.53]I gotta go find Coyote Bongwater.
[50:38.11]I can't believe I just said that.
[50:40.87]Yeah, let's do it.
[50:42.35]Fine.
[50:42.91]And then, can I kill him now?
[50:43.89]Can I, like... Can I, uh... Alright, he's doing the Steve Martin, uh, two wild and crazy guys dance.
[50:53.06]What's with me and the old shit references today?
[50:56.54]That's Dan Aykroyd and Steve Martin's old SNL bit.
[50:59.18]Like, why am I this old?
[51:04.81]Did anybody, like, get... Did anybody understand that one?
[51:10.79]That's old.
[51:11.23]That's really old.
[51:13.37]If even 10 people here thought that was funny, I'm glad you did.
[51:16.75]But if not, I've got to make a more relevant reference.
[51:19.89]This is for the younger crowd that's here.
[51:28.83]He's in virtual reality.
[51:30.27]He's got a virtual reality helmet on.
[51:32.21]He's doing...
[51:36.06]He's playing like a window washing simulation game.
[51:38.98]He's dabbing.
[51:40.64]There you go.
[51:43.66]He's playing Fortnite in VR.
[51:44.65]The desecration of this land offends mine all-seeing eye.
[51:47.99]Read the vicinity of human-made refuse.
[51:50.87]Thus spake Ark Voodle.
[51:58.48]While holding L1, rapidly press X to scan the human.
[52:02.56]I need to get rid of... What did I get rid of?
[52:05.88]Do I have to just clean this stuff up?
[52:15.23]Oops, that's gonna go down.
[52:16.53]Oh my god, that's gonna roll down and kill those people.
[52:18.13]No, it's not.
[52:20.75]Alright, we're good.
[52:23.88]Hmm.
[52:32.03]I will say that this is an interesting take on... This kind of reminds me of the Fabled Demon Doors.
[52:48.39]Alright, well, let's activate it.
[52:51.03]Sasa must be repaired before you can use this landing zone.
[52:54.45]Alright, well, at least I have it now.
[52:55.56]I need to get a new disguise.
[52:56.78]I'm going to need to find some Revolut.
[53:02.55]So we're going to take this girl's body and then make everybody dance.
[53:08.02]Come on, hurry up.
[53:13.08]Come here.
[53:13.84]They've seen you.
[53:14.38]Yes, they have.
[53:14.88]It's okay.
[53:18.18]That seems like an extreme get-out-of-jail-free card.
[53:20.43]It really does.
[53:20.93]Alright, we've got to find Mr. Revolut here.
[53:22.65]We're going to find the can, wherever it is.
[53:26.23]Let's see if we can scan some people.
[53:32.28]If this bong water guy thinks he can buy my loyalty by handing out free samples of his home-brewed mind-altering substance on Hashberry Street, Hashberry Street.
[53:41.02]We got it.
[53:41.38]It's all about buzz, man.
[53:45.64]Okay.
[53:46.52]Hashberry Street.
[53:47.38]We could go this way.
[53:48.60]I wish I could just fly there.
[53:50.62]I wish I could drive a car.
[53:53.72]Should play Fable 1.
[53:54.61]That game is fantastic.
[53:57.05]That is one of my favorite old games.
[53:59.91]The original Xbox.
[54:05.08]Did you just bump?
[54:07.71]It's okay.
[54:12.03]Fable 2?
[54:12.59]Fable 2 was... Fable 2 was really easy.
[54:21.54]Everything in Fable 2 felt like it was just going through the motions and beating it extraordinarily easily.
[54:27.69]Fable 1 actually was kind of challenging in some places.
[54:35.50]I think we just have it.
[54:37.18]Uh, Hashberry Street.
[54:38.32]Okay.
[54:38.46]We're looking for him.
[54:41.26]We're pretty much there.
[54:43.35]You know, I'm about to rip out of this person.
[54:51.29]Well, he did me a favor.
[54:52.17]He hit me so hard, I fucking launched out of the lady.
[54:59.47]Alright.
[54:59.89]Is he still beeping at the person?
[55:03.55]That person's not going to get out of the way.
[55:05.23]He doesn't even realize it.
[55:11.05]He's still beeping.
[55:16.98]You're going to have to move.
[55:18.08]Just drive.
[55:18.66]What are you people doing?
[55:19.68]Why are you doing this?
[55:34.09]What's wrong with you?
[55:39.91]Oh, this is so fucking stupid.
[55:42.40]Don't you love old open world games?
[55:46.46]I could sit here all day.
[55:53.64]You know what?
[55:54.26]You know what?
[55:55.38]There needs to be a traffic light here.
[55:56.74]God damn it.
[55:58.95]There needs to be a crosswalk and a traffic light.
[56:00.75]Do you want to see a real reality situation?
[56:03.30]If I was a government official, I would make that happen with some legislation.
[56:18.85]This just reminds me of, like, somebody set up a camera here and they're doing, like, a documentary about, like, the most unsafe road in Russia.
[56:28.10]There are over 45 deaths a week on the Klovach West Road in Eastern Province of Russia.
[56:40.38]The 15 most deadly streets in all of the country in the world.
[56:49.15]Oh, they all despawned, whatever.
[56:54.71]Most unsafe world... Most unsafe road in San Francisco.
[56:58.69]Oh fuck, I'm about to snatch out.
[57:00.05]Alright, I need to find this dude.
[57:07.85]Are they all the same guy?
[57:11.56]All the country in the world.
[57:13.78]Hashberry Street.
[57:15.74]Aren't we there?
[57:18.08]He's like right here somewhere.
[57:19.12]Oh shit, they've seen me.
[57:20.88]There he is.
[57:21.20]That's him right there.
[57:21.72]It has to be.
[57:22.58]He's right next to a dead guy.
[57:27.98]Is this him?
[57:29.85]How did this guy die?
[57:33.47]No, don't do it.
[57:34.27]Don't bring back another old fucking reference.
[57:36.39]This guy's planking.
[57:37.69]I did it.
[57:38.25]I'm sorry, but this is only fucking old references today.
[57:41.55]Okay, is this the guy?
[57:43.87]Alright, where the hell are we?
[57:45.47]We need to go to Hashberry Street.
[57:57.86]That's like where we are.
[57:58.60]Is he like over here?
[58:00.77]This is where the saucer is, isn't it?
[58:02.57]Yeah, that's where the saucer is.
[58:04.23]He's gonna be standing on the road here somewhere.
[58:07.55]Let's try all the way to the end of this road.
[58:34.19]I don't see it.
[58:34.79]Wait, hold on.
[58:36.95]This is like a bong.
[58:37.67]Yeah, this looks like a stand to me.
[58:44.05]Is that bong water?
[58:45.61]No.
[58:46.05]Come on, where's this bong water stand?
[58:58.53]God damn it.
[59:05.14]So I'm not even on Hashberry anymore.
[59:07.02]Maybe just go this way.
[59:12.78]Are you serious?
[59:17.24]Right over here?
[59:20.60]Maybe in a back alley?
[59:24.35]Oh, hold on.
[59:24.75]I could have given somebody else.
[59:26.55]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[59:36.68]Okay, put it down here.
[59:39.66]We go all the way to... I'm fine.
[59:41.80]What about over here?
[59:44.57]Bongwater Street?
[59:47.55]Enter Bongwater HQ.
[59:49.11]There it is.
[59:49.47]Oh, it's just a house.
[59:58.77]No visitors at Bongwater.
[60:03.38]Let me just drink some bong water for fuck's sake.
[60:05.64]Alright.
[60:05.98]Easy as that.
[60:20.60]And next week, we'll start one-on-one Shakti tutoring.
[60:25.07]I'll be giving each of you private, hands-on instruction in Kriyanish Padi, the highest state of tantric arousal.
[60:33.37]These sessions could run ten hours.
[60:36.63]So eat a good breakfast.
[60:38.18]I need something more to drink.
[60:39.86]Not like alcohol.
[60:41.03]Maybe I do.
[60:41.31]Do I want alcohol?
[60:41.77]No, it's Tuesday.
[60:42.47]That's a mistake.
[60:43.01]Goddamn flashbacks.
[61:03.76]I'm not making any more references.
[61:07.50]Older than five years.
[61:08.44]It's a spider!
[61:09.00]Wow, it's a spider!
[61:09.54]There's a spider!
[61:11.39]Oh, fuck me!
[61:11.99]That's the spider that was here like a week ago!
[61:17.39]Oh, fuck me!
[61:30.33]Oh, you fucking asshole.
[61:31.49]He's right there.
[61:32.79]Oh, fuck.
[61:34.39]He crawled across the monitor.
[61:39.87]God damn it.
[61:44.30]Just, like, look at this.
[61:45.10]Here, I'll put chat on it.
[61:47.16]What do I do about this?
[61:48.28]Hold on.
[61:50.94]I can't play the game right now.
[61:55.28]You gonna...
[61:57.47]Oh my god, he's running away.
[61:58.21]There he is.
[62:00.17]Fuck me.
[62:06.79]He's behind the monitor.
[62:15.22]He's on top of the monitor over there.
[62:17.74]Hold on.
[62:20.02]This is bad.
[62:23.24]Can you see him?
[62:24.12]Hold on.
[62:28.64]There he goes, there he goes, there he goes, there he goes, there he goes!
[62:30.83]Whoa!
[62:31.15]Oh, he's right there!
[62:40.27]Oh, fuck.
[62:41.71]Oh, he's gonna kill me.
[62:45.40]He's fucking huge.
[62:46.54]He's like as big as an ox.
[62:50.12]He's on the keyboard.
[62:50.86]I can't even play the video game right now.
[62:56.12]You asshole, why are you here?
[63:02.54]He's like the size of a bird.
[63:05.76]I'm hanging out back here.
[63:09.40]I'm not gonna sit at this desk ever again.
[63:14.62]I'm gonna burn this desk.
[63:20.32]I can't even touch my mouse.
[63:26.64]He's been here for... He's so fast.
[63:30.32]Why are you this fast?
[63:33.07]Why can't spiders, why are they so fast?
[63:35.77]He just sprinted across the keyboard.
[63:41.17]I'm staying back here for the rest of the stream, I don't even care.
[63:44.03]I'm gonna move the mic over here.
[63:51.18]I'm not afraid of spiders, okay?
[63:54.46]I'm not afraid of spiders, I'm not.
[63:55.94]I just don't like their movements.
[64:00.99]It's like, okay, let me, oh, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[64:02.75]It's like, I'm not afraid of airplanes, right?
[64:05.79]I'm not scared of the airplane.
[64:07.21]I just, I just don't like them.
[64:09.45]I just don't like being on an airplane.
[64:10.69]I'm not scared of taking off.
[64:11.82]I'm not scared of being in the sky.
[64:14.02]I just don't like airplanes.
[64:15.12]I'm not scared of spiders.
[64:15.98]I just don't like them.
[64:21.32]Higher alert levels will cause humans to send stronger.
[64:23.36]Plus, I got bit by a spider one time and it gave me a rash.
[64:25.88]So, yes, I have some bias fear against them.
[64:29.98]I got a fucking giant rash from being bit by a spider before.
[64:32.76]Are you kidding me?
[64:33.28]I don't know what kind of spider it was.
[64:39.93]It was a rash, though.
[64:40.81]I got a rash.
[64:44.63]Use police box.
[64:47.59]I can, like, destroy police.
[64:48.51]Oh, I can, like, hold on.
[64:49.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[64:50.12]Let me get this.
[64:51.72]Hold on.
[65:02.69]We start dancing Okay, so I have a long I have a long cord Frank call He's gonna get on the court Hey, why the long face?
[65:29.04]That's it.
[65:29.40]That's all it takes.
[65:30.30]Okay.
[65:32.55]Well, sure.
[65:37.93]Somebody gave $50 and I have to get close to the monitor to see what it is.
[65:45.78]Okay, hold on.
[65:47.40]Somebody gave $50.
[65:47.84]I have to overcome my non-fear of spiders.
[65:53.22]I'm not afraid of them.
[65:55.92]They're just ugly and they're irritating.
[65:59.37]Okay, I'm coming in.
[66:00.91]I'm about to put my hand on the mouse.
[66:02.19]You can do it, Jeremy.
[66:02.91]Come on.
[66:03.35]Overcome.
[66:03.97]He's right here.
[66:04.83]He's literally on this area right here where my hand's about to go.
[66:07.80]Just put your hand inside.
[66:08.74]Okay, I clicked.
[66:10.76]I'm good.
[66:11.54]Hey, thank you.
[66:12.64]Palm put.
[66:13.66]Palm put.
[66:14.04]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[66:17.14]Thank you so much, dude.
[66:19.12]If this Jerma guy thinks he can buy my loyalty with funny streams, then he's right.
[66:24.01]Thank you. $50.
[66:28.63]Thank you so much.
[66:35.74]Much appreciated, dude.
[66:37.40]You guys have been giving a lot of money tonight.
[66:39.78]So all I can say is thanks.
[66:42.46]It's very kind of you guys.
[66:44.85]And to cap this whole spider conversation, no, I don't want to kill them because they're good.
[66:50.79]They eat bad bugs.
[66:52.70]They eat mosquitoes.
[66:53.64]They eat centipedes.
[66:56.34]They eat crabs and fucking mice in your walls.
[67:00.80]You don't want to kill spiders.
[67:03.10]Plus, it's like 100 years bad luck to kill a spider.
[67:05.89]Don't you know that?
[67:06.45]Alright, this is the next missions over here.
[67:19.59]Come on, you can make it.
[67:20.37]You can do it.
[67:20.77]I know you can.
[67:21.23]No, they're not going to do it.
[67:26.99]Next mission, please.
[67:32.08]Rip out of this guy's body.
[67:34.02]Zap him a little.
[67:35.62]Make sure he doesn't tell anybody.
[67:38.44]Next mission.
[67:39.04]Ugh.
[67:42.13]I have this distinct fear of him.
[67:44.30]Crawling on my headphone Jack.
[67:46.16]Along the cord and up into my mouth.
[67:49.20]I can't get away from it.
[67:51.16]It's fucking terrifying.
[67:52.04]I hate them.
[67:52.48]But I don't hate them.
[67:53.42]They're good.
[67:54.02]Okay.
[67:54.18]Run this by me one more time.
[68:12.74]Is he on me?
[68:17.28]No.
[68:17.92]I've lost control, man.
[68:24.47]Anytime you have to ask, is he on me?
[68:27.83]No, he's never.
[68:28.95]It's never on you.
[68:30.09]It will never be on you.
[68:33.35]This isn't like a fucking... They're not headcrabs.
[68:36.38]It's not on you.
[68:39.09]You're gonna feel it in your hair.
[68:40.67]You're gonna feel it all on your chin and stuff.
[68:43.23]No, they're not on you.
[68:44.45]He's hiding in the corner here next to the desk.
[68:47.77]He's just doing his own shit.
[68:48.67]He just wanted to take a walk and I'm like freaking out about it.
[68:52.32]Alright.
[68:54.42]So, we got... We got two here.
[68:58.08]Disguise yourself as the hippie chick.
[68:59.40]Body snatch a cop.
[69:05.49]So, probably should have done that.
[69:10.07]Uh, you are not a cop.
[69:11.23]Looking for a cop.
[69:13.49]Policeman.
[69:14.03]I could just call in a prank, right?
[69:16.92]Have him come in.
[69:18.26]We'll do that.
[69:18.82]Well, don't even... Why would I need to do that when they're literally right in front of me?
[69:23.32]Oops.
[69:24.06]Whoa, are they dead?
[69:25.40]That guy... What the hell was that?
[69:30.07]Come here.
[69:33.27]Are you serious?
[69:38.78]Alright, now everybody dance.
[69:40.78]Pretend you never saw me.
[69:43.62]And he just killed him.
[69:47.15]What the fuck just happened?
[69:51.43]Everybody dance.
[69:52.27]How are you up and standing?
[69:53.73]What are you doing?
[69:57.31]Okay.
[69:58.35]We're fine.
[69:58.84]I have a police officer outfit.
[70:05.87]Go to the nearest police box.
[70:07.60]Call backup.
[70:08.30]Call all clear.
[70:13.22]I'm the favorite streamer of the spider.
[70:22.95]It sucks because... You know when you just know... Like, I saw this spider... A week ago.
[70:31.12]And now I forgot about him.
[70:32.64]And I'm sitting here just minding my own business and he dashes across my monitor.
[70:36.25]Every single horror movie goes into my brain.
[70:38.45]He's been stalking me.
[70:39.77]He's been fucking watching me.
[70:41.71]He's been finding the opportunity where he can be in front of me and sprint past my screen.
[70:45.67]He likes the screams.
[71:00.18]Free love.
[71:01.74]Oh, okay.
[71:03.00]Let's go talk to the hippie guru.
[71:04.82]There he is.
[71:05.40]Are you going to sell to me now?
[71:09.73]Use a hippie disguise.
[71:10.55]He won't talk to squares.
[71:14.11]Okay.
[71:23.15]What?
[71:23.35]I can't do it?
[71:26.25]I can't... Oh, it's on cooldown.
[71:28.69]I can't just be a total lack of awareness here?
[71:31.96]Okay, let's go.
[71:34.26]Alright, freak.
[71:41.40]Let me in your business adventure.
[71:42.90]Ugh.
[71:49.16]I think it just chills in my spine here.
[71:51.28]Okay, let's make some small talk here.
[71:52.68]Some of them jumped too... Get over the spider!
[72:16.82]Get over it.
[72:17.16]He got over me.
[72:18.01]Time to get over him.
[72:20.81]I need to get out of this relationship I have with the spider.
[72:42.25]Okay, where's Hyda?
[72:44.31]Okay, so where's Bongwater Hyda?
[72:47.63]Nobody knows, man.
[72:49.71]He just sends his goons out to spread the revelade.
[72:55.34]Just like a snake hiding in the grass.
[72:59.64]But he can't hide forever.
[73:01.88]I got a couple of pretty good weed whackers of my own.
[73:06.55]Relevancy.
[73:07.81]What's the plan, buddy?
[73:08.83]What's that wacko up to now?
[73:12.11]Don't pay attention to the welt on your neck.
[73:14.89]You saw the rash I had.
[73:16.09]I had a massive rash all over my body and it was caused definitely
[73:39.98]Definitely by this spider in this room.
[73:42.31]Alright, let's do it.
[73:43.03]Blow up the blimp.
[74:09.04]They shoot hippies don't they pox we got a situation here bong water must be drinking Freaks and geeks I'm glad it doesn't hurt me Luckily I've detected four data calls from the mother
[74:37.95]Alright, so we're going to do our first mission inside of the... Repair pods.
[74:47.35]So let's get the repair pods.
[74:53.99]Retrieve the saucer repair pods.
[74:55.35]They are just everywhere.
[74:56.61]Go, go, go.
[74:58.89]Go, go.
[75:01.75]Gotcha.
[75:02.25]What the hell is that thing?
[75:05.74]Whoa, wait a minute, guys.
[75:08.04]Alright, give me the... I got that one.
[75:24.01]They've seen me.
[75:27.25]I think it's time that I just started fighting people.
[75:32.38]What do you guys think?
[75:33.98]Alert up.
[75:35.62]Don't have enough of this yet.
[75:36.40]Let me call the police and tell them not to come.
[75:38.08]Because I am the police.
[75:42.40]Okay.
[75:43.72]Yes, I'm currently being shot at.
[75:48.73]Do they listen?
[76:01.25]Oh, they listen.
[76:02.31]Oh, shit.
[76:02.83]They listen.
[76:03.85]Whatever.
[76:04.35]It's time to destroy.
[76:05.29]Come here.
[76:24.06]Come here.
[76:24.28]Come here.
[76:24.69]Come here.
[76:29.27]Come on.
[76:29.63]Come on.
[76:29.95]I need to do my PK.
[76:32.71]Got it.
[76:33.57]Alright, let's go.
[76:40.88]But Jeremy, your weapons suck.
[76:43.16]For now, they do.
[76:45.84]They won't suck very shortly.
[76:46.86]I didn't know there was going to be a restricted area.
[76:49.22]Ah!
[76:49.38]Okay.
[76:51.22]So this lady is not allowed to go in here.
[76:52.70]So if I can just make them dance, right?
[76:55.74]That's all you have to do.
[76:56.48]Just make everybody dance and run and grab them.
[77:03.36]Like this.
[77:07.89]It's that simple.
[77:12.15]All clear.
[77:12.73]I'm going to cross the way here.
[77:17.25]Good, good, good, good.
[77:18.97]Good.
[77:19.38]A lot of people that make dance here.
[77:22.10]Just wait for it.
[77:24.52]It's almost done with cooldown.
[77:26.04]Let's get it.
[77:29.26]Now that was a clean snatch.
[77:30.52]It was.
[77:33.16]Three, two, one.
[77:37.52]This guy will be easier to do it to.
[77:44.10]Goodbye.
[77:47.34]I gotta lose this.
[77:48.02]I gotta snatch a new body here.
[77:50.95]So I got a plan.
[77:52.79]I'm gonna like bend over and shit this lady into the water.
[78:10.61]It's alright.
[78:12.71]That was a good plan, though.
[78:14.13]Now let me come up here and take you.
[78:22.52]We're good.
[78:24.34]Let's go.
[78:26.06]I'm so glad there's a checkpoint there.
[78:27.62]That makes me happy.
[78:41.54]Next batch, I can go around the corner.
[78:47.68]And make everybody dance again.
[78:50.02]Feel the love!
[78:51.80]Yes, feel the love.
[78:57.97]Last ones over here.
[79:01.49]Easy mission!
[79:04.35]The spider's going to be laying eggs.
[79:06.77]How many eggs can a spider lay in one mating period?
[79:09.83]Well, they don't have a mate.
[79:12.03]There's no other spider here to have sex with.
[79:13.63]Do spiders have sex with each other?
[79:17.21]They don't, right?
[79:18.81]No, they don't.
[79:25.26]No, they don't.
[79:27.48]The female just lays eggs.
[79:30.80]Because the stork brings them their eggs.
[79:36.96]How does a spider have sex?
[79:40.14]The female, like, puts down the egg soup, and the male comes over.
[79:45.21]And, like, pees on them, and then the babies come out five months later.
[79:48.89]Hold on, this spider's right there.
[79:57.89]He heard me.
[79:58.47]He heard me talk shit.
[80:00.59]He's like, you don't think I fuck?
[80:03.31]Of course I do, you asshole!
[80:10.73]I want to get that.
[80:19.56]He thought I was offering.
[80:22.84]Can you imagine if that was possible?
[80:27.29]Imagine if like a spider-human-DNA hybrid could exist.
[80:31.57]That's terrifying.
[80:35.22]No, no, no.
[80:35.96]I'm not talking about... That's not what I'm talking about.
[80:38.66]Relax.
[80:39.66]I'm not talking about that.
[80:40.68]I'm talking about if you could splice DNA in a laboratory.
[80:49.63]We're talking about laboratory splicing, not bedroom splicing.
[80:59.41]Emote only has to go on now.
[81:04.70]I'm sorry.
[81:05.50]I'm sorry.
[81:06.32]I'm sorry!
[81:09.10]I'm talking about in a lab.
[81:11.94]You guys just take everything so sexually.
[81:15.70]You guys go just loot mines in the gutter.
[81:18.72]Pull them out.
[81:20.70]Go read a book.
[81:22.46]Alright, let's go.
[81:29.33]Drop the disguise, sure.
[81:35.83]Alright, enter cockpit.
[81:41.67]Let's go.
[81:50.46]You ever hear of the Pikman experiment thing?
[81:52.96]No.
[81:56.28]I just remember when they tried to splice a human with a fly.
[81:59.04]That was like really weird when scientists tried to do that.
[82:03.35]Like, it almost worked.
[82:05.27]No, actually, I'm describing the plot of the movie The Fly.
[82:08.17]That didn't happen.
[82:08.97]That's not real.
[82:16.24]I can hold L1 to move to a vehicle and hold L1 to target it.
[82:20.77]While holding L1, quickly press the circle button to drain energy from the vehicle.
[82:32.77]I can abduct the car?
[82:37.09]What is going on right now?
[82:37.97]Okay.
[82:42.34]Drain?
[82:43.26]Destroy the balloons?
[82:44.88]Alright, I want to abduct the car.
[82:46.66]I can't abduct the car.
[82:48.42]Ooh, that hurts.
[82:48.90]You can slingshot?
[82:49.88]I love the slingshots.
[82:51.36]What about a person?
[82:52.32]Let's get a person.
[83:03.14]I got him.
[83:04.90]What do I do about this?
[83:10.55]Can I breed these people or something?
[83:13.97]I don't understand.
[83:15.17]It's like, oh, it tells you what they are, where they came from.
[83:17.51]You can raise or lower the... Okay.
[83:21.73]Get rid of the balloons.
[83:26.73]One.
[83:28.31]Two.
[83:28.69]Is there a fast button?
[83:35.53]I gotta go quick.
[83:38.59]Just can't let it get all the way up.
[83:43.70]Don't take too much damage though.
[83:49.64]Oh shit, easy buddy.
[83:51.38]Get up the tanks.
[83:53.95]You can actually aim the laser this time.
[84:04.58]What is this music?
[84:05.84]Um, I don't know.
[84:08.72]A popular song back in the, uh, 70s?
[84:10.66]60s?
[84:10.88]This takes place in the 60s, right?
[84:13.08]70s?
[84:13.16]Pretty good draw distance.
[84:24.57]Oh, come on, this is PlayStation 2.
[84:27.63]It's PS2.
[84:32.05]Jesus, man, hold on.
[84:37.18]Get the V2 rocket.
[84:43.68]Alright, climb over here.
[84:47.09]Don't let them increase the Revelade level.
[84:51.61]He was complimenting the game.
[84:52.87]Oh, really?
[84:53.23]Yeah, I was going to say.
[84:55.37]Well, hold on.
[84:55.81]Let me be fair, though.
[84:57.33]This is not on PS2 right now.
[85:02.09]They brought these games over to PS4.
[85:04.49]By the way, if you're curious, you're like, oh shit, this is a PS2 game, I can't play it.
[85:07.59]Yes, you can.
[85:09.55]Destroy All Humans 1 and 2 have been ported and HD scaled to 1080p.
[85:16.99]So, this is currently being played on the PS4 upscaled.
[85:20.27]So, you just need a PS4.
[85:23.43]Okay, apparently the mission is complete, but I can still die.
[85:36.39]Take out the supplier, kill Mr. Bongwater.
[85:38.21]I need some health.
[85:42.71]Gene Blender.
[85:43.43]You can use the Gene Blender to upgrade your abilities.
[85:45.73]Okay, so that is what I was talking about.
[85:49.71]Thrust X while flying the saucer to activate the Gene Blender.
[85:55.33]See?
[85:55.59]I told you.
[85:56.57]You guys all thought I was like a sicko.
[85:58.75]No, this is in the game.
[86:01.03]Abduct humans into your saucer and experiment on them with the gene blender.
[86:05.76]Complete gene blends to upgrade your abilities.
[86:11.24]Okay.
[86:13.24]Fool the flower child.
[86:15.00]Okay, Merry Pranksters.
[86:20.17]Body snatch Bay City hippie dudes at twice the rate.
[86:24.91]Body snatch Bay City hippie chicks at twice the rate.
[86:29.83]So I need to collect, like, five hippies.
[86:34.29]I've just got to collect people.
[86:36.98]Okay.
[86:38.62]Sounds like a plan.
[86:40.36]Obduct humans.
[86:40.92]Yeah, abduct them.
[86:42.02]Move the saucer directly over the human and hold down when to target it.
[86:44.88]While holding it, press triangle to abduct the human.
[86:47.28]Press triangle again to store the human.
[86:51.07]Let's go store some people.
[86:55.35]You.
[86:57.99]That's not what I expected somebody to say.
[87:02.87]We need hippies.
[87:05.27]Cops.
[87:07.13]Oh, easy.
[87:07.63]Hold on.
[87:09.86]Hippie.
[87:13.46]Cop.
[87:14.66]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[87:16.42]I gotta be careful here.
[87:17.38]Let me just take this shit out.
[87:21.47]Are these to destroy the buildings or just destroy the guy?
[87:33.48]The building doesn't have a health bar like in... Wait, what?
[87:45.17]Oh, that's a quest.
[87:49.53]Okay!
[87:51.91]Sorry, I just destroyed your quest.
[87:55.69]Let me land then.
[87:58.27]Didn't I get a landing zone?
[88:01.67]Let me see here.
[88:03.65]One hippie.
[88:06.21]Okay.
[88:07.99]I guess you just have to blend them.
[88:09.01]Just pick them up and blend them.
[88:14.84]There we go.
[88:15.20]Right here.
[88:22.40]That sounds terrible when you blend.
[88:26.96]Super alert.
[88:30.19]Can I repair?
[88:30.91]Let me go into the... Okay, hold on.
[88:32.55]I have 12.
[88:36.06]Jetpack.
[88:36.52]Increase jetpack, vertical boost.
[88:38.34]It's 18.
[88:39.18]I feel like I should get that first.
[88:41.66]The disk gun.
[88:42.44]Increase death ray heat damage.
[88:47.04]The rest of this is locked.
[88:48.76]Seems like a lot of stuff.
[88:49.62]Alright, what do we got here?
[88:52.36]Increases the shield for crypto.
[88:53.72]Increases the shield for the saucer.
[88:58.20]I feel like I want to get this first.
[88:59.54]But let's do more damage.
[89:00.14]More damage and more battery.
[89:01.18]Just because we're going to need it.
[89:06.66]We are.
[89:06.90]We just are.
[89:07.18]Okay.
[89:23.30]Alright, uh, gene blender into the cockpit.
[89:25.90]Don't need to do any of that right now.
[89:27.12]Let's go... Let's go do a side... I wanna do a side mission.
[89:29.82]Let's go see what the side missions are.
[89:31.47]Okay, hold on here.
[89:43.37]Run!
[89:43.89]For your lives!
[89:44.98]I knew it was gonna happen.
[89:46.50]Got it!
[89:48.21]Can the tank dance?
[89:50.33]Can I get the tank to dance?
[89:52.61]Does it like lift its nozzle up and down, nodding its head?
[89:57.05]There we go, this guy.
[90:04.66]I think I'm actually good.
[90:05.98]Yeah, I am.
[90:08.48]I should be a military guy though, shouldn't I?
[90:14.37]Archivoodle cult missions are marked as alien eyes on your radar.
[90:18.55]Ark Voodoo is very generous and offers great rewards for those who serve him.
[90:25.45]I mean, right here, might as well do it, right?
[90:31.02]I gotta drop the human disguise.
[90:34.22]What does Pox have to say about this?
[90:35.62]Let's just see.
[90:36.60]I guess this is what you do.
[90:42.98]Oh my goodness, that was insane!
[90:45.71]Who did that?
[90:46.69]I think it was this person!
[90:52.30]To meet my maker.
[90:56.80]She's just like looking around.
[90:57.86]Uh.
[91:01.99]Who did that?
[91:06.37]She's looking at me talking.
[91:08.87]She's in shock.
[91:09.69]You put me in mind again.
[91:27.44]There are military people just walking around.
[91:32.08]What?
[91:32.86]What prophecy?
[91:34.56]The missile launcher is still there.
[91:36.00]Is he still working?
[91:37.82]Is Richard Horvitz still doing voice work?
[91:40.27]I don't think I've heard him in anything recently.
[91:55.84]wait a minute it sounds incredible I knew but crypto what if it's true it's currently in skylanders I did take a red pill this morning okay just for the sake of argument let's say you're right
[92:21.60]How the hell am I supposed to bring about the second coming of Art Voodle?
[92:27.07]The scriptures say Art Voodle will return when enough seekers believe in him again.
[92:33.35]You mean like Tinkerbell?
[92:36.11]Does he talk?
[92:36.69]Can we get his side of the story here?
[92:41.01]Humanity is desperate to reconnect the physical and spiritual.
[92:46.38]All that's needed is for you to spread the good pickup line.
[92:51.00]Good pickup line.
[92:52.14]God.
[92:52.22]Spider's back, walking across the table right now.
[92:59.55]He's on my... He's on my, like, equalizer right now.
[93:03.61]Just chilling, looking at me.
[93:20.30]Why are you still here?
[93:27.19]Get out of here.
[93:27.95]Just go into the wall somewhere.
[93:30.59]Leave me alone.
[93:31.21]Fuck.
[93:38.84]You know when you see something, when your whole body, you can just feel like the chill tingles all over your whole body, your stomach, your back, your neck.
[93:49.25]He's just looking at me.
[93:50.01]He's just sitting there looking at me.
[93:51.03]This sucks.
[93:53.45]I'm being... No, not ASMR.
[93:55.17]Not that.
[93:55.83]I'm talking about, like, the fuck me kind of feeling.
[94:01.05]Not ASMR.
[94:15.21]Spider's gonna, like, come over here and start eating carrots in the microphone.
[94:18.92]What do I do?
[94:19.42]Hello, it is I, Ockvoodle.
[94:23.16]Oh, never mind.
[94:45.52]Let's go and yawn and yawn and yawn and yawn and-
[95:00.01]I just felt something on me - fucking stop it. Jesus Christ.
[95:06.01]He's- it's this thing.
[95:07.05]The glory of Ark Voodle grows from the highest state of chaotic fecundity.
[95:12.53]When the ring turns orange and the population's nerves are frayed, then shall the ground be fit to sow, and the masses shall follow.
[95:22.38]Thus spake Ark Voodle.
[95:25.78]Bow chicka bow down.
[95:31.61]Okay, so what would you like me to do?
[95:35.05]Raise the alert level to orange.
[95:37.67]These just are demon doors.
[95:39.85]Watch this.
[95:42.19]You ready for this one?
[95:43.15]We're going to shed the snakeskin into the street and hit it with a car.
[95:53.86]Come on, I just need a car.
[95:54.80]I need to snakeskin this lady into the street and have her get run over, her head run over.
[95:58.06]Come on.
[96:04.07]You went the wrong goddamn way.
[96:05.05]You can't get a clear shot!
[96:11.53]D.D.
[96:12.35]Miles, son of a bitch!
[96:18.33]No, you... What the fuck?
[96:27.24]Anybody catch the number of that tank?
[96:30.32]Feel so...
[96:33.17]They're not gonna move now.
[96:34.43]My whole plan is done.
[96:37.05]Okay, just fuck it.
[96:38.42]Destroy it.
[96:44.48]Just kill it.
[96:46.84]Alert level orange is what we're looking for.
[96:52.69]Okay.
[96:55.79]I was going to try to juggle that guy.
[96:57.45]Come here.
[97:00.17]What level are we at?
[97:04.97]Where do you see your level?
[97:08.45]He has to take a lot of damage.
[97:30.31]Wow, that was an explosion.
[97:38.94]Hey Spencer, how you doing?
[97:41.49]I think we're at like blue.
[97:45.03]Need more explosions?
[97:47.63]Reuse my phone.
[97:48.99]There we go.
[97:49.75]Now we're at yellow.
[97:50.43]Currently at yellow.
[97:51.75]Let's get the other... Let's do this for a little bit.
[97:56.49]It's fun to watch people fly around.
[98:00.57]Get out of the car.
[98:16.84]Whoa, that launches shit.
[98:20.88]No, get this.
[98:26.21]Is he in the car?
[98:27.99]I'm so confused.
[98:32.37]I got to watch out.
[98:36.88]No, fuck.
[98:40.48]Don't die here.
[98:45.44]It's a grenade.
[98:53.28]I don't do enough damage.
[98:59.53]Jesus!
[99:00.09]Watch out for that shit.
[99:01.93]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[99:03.69]Get away from me.
[99:09.21]Yellow.
[99:09.47]I need more than yellow.
[99:16.70]You fucking asshole, really?
[99:31.95]Come on.
[99:33.61]How long does it take me to get my shields back?
[99:36.97]There we go.
[99:39.73]I fucking swear to God, I didn't do anything.
[99:42.25]I just picked it up off the ground.
[99:44.41]I picked it up and it exploded.
[99:55.18]You can use the police box as a ra- where the hell even was that shit?
[100:01.22]Where, where, where on the map was that?
[100:04.35]Over, I don't, back there?
[100:12.32]Don't forget to upgrade your weapons at the... Enter.
[100:23.72]No, you fucking... Just kill.
[100:29.75]Just call the police.
[100:31.19]Who cares?
[100:32.39]Yes, I'd like to report a disturbance.
[100:40.95]I can't...
[100:51.59]Alright, goodbye.
[100:55.24]Uh, call in backup.
[100:57.88]Turn yourself in.
[100:59.98]Help!
[101:00.42]And there it is.
[101:02.76]We're at blue.
[101:03.82]Can I just use the same phone and call a bunch of times?
[101:09.71]Yeah, I can.
[101:20.10]We need more police!
[101:22.42]Let's just keep doing it again.
[101:24.58]Oh, it's at arm!
[101:26.51]Jesus.
[101:26.69]Oh my god.
[101:27.21]Well, okay.
[101:51.59]That one's done.
[101:54.13]There's the next mission.
[101:54.95]Oh, it opened up.
[101:56.47]This is fun.
[101:57.45]This is cool.
[101:58.43]I like this game.
[102:00.83]I can see why this game is way more interesting than the first one.
[102:03.38]The first one was fun.
[102:05.18]But they took the first game and made it what the first game probably wanted to be.
[102:08.86]Let me see what's over here.
[102:18.72]There is the two side missions.
[102:20.96]Let's just see what they are.
[102:27.24]They took the first game and made it hornier.
[102:29.38]Oh, are these the Ark-Boodle people?
[102:32.71]Let's see.
[102:35.49]Well, no you didn't.
[102:36.37]We can see him, but...
[102:52.40]clean let's check out this place thank god I didn't save myself from marriage alright can I claim this now let's call it over here let's have it closer actually do I have enough to upgrade anything I might
[103:16.77]Did I just stab him?
[103:17.69]His head?
[103:18.05]Alright, that was cool.
[103:20.89]Twelve.
[103:24.09]Already got this one.
[103:25.59]Didn't get this one.
[103:26.17]Chain lightning, more targets.
[103:28.91]No, I want the jetpack boost.
[103:30.03]Yeah, forget that.
[103:36.60]Side mission.
[103:37.12]Let's do it.
[103:40.80]Save the game.
[103:41.34]I will.
[103:48.54]Okay, what's the plan?
[103:51.26]Well, with the mothership gone and our mission in jeopardy, it's high time we contacted the Furon homeworld and requested some backup.
[103:59.61]Finally.
[104:00.93]I'm sick of having to fight off these monkeys with an understocked armory.
[104:06.15]Game Jux?
[104:07.92]Sucks Jux.
[104:08.78]No, it does not.
[104:10.38]The balance of power will swiftly be restored.
[104:14.28]This is a game...
[104:19.56]Sucks, Jux?
[104:20.28]That's not the way you... This game is good.
[104:22.72]Do not anger me by telling me that Jux sucks.
[104:31.58]This bottle is fucking heavy and thick.
[104:36.48]You should not have a bottle this heavy and thick with glass, man.
[104:38.92]Think of the environment.
[104:41.78]Sounds like a major pain in the tuchus.
[104:45.26]So, who's the unlucky bastard you conned into?
[104:48.44]Oh.
[104:48.52]Right.
[104:48.68]Okay, but what human junk could we possibly use to make an interstellar transmitter array?
[105:09.92]Bacteria soup.
[105:11.28]I don't even like this stuff.
[105:12.12]It's the only thing I had in the fridge.
[105:13.82]I would have drank it a Mountain Dew.
[105:14.90]No, I wouldn't have drank a Mountain Dew.
[105:17.51]I left my pants in San Fran-er, Bay City.
[105:37.90]Carry the antenna parts to the construction area.
[105:41.06]Okay.
[105:42.24]Okay, can you guys guess what my favorite drink is?
[106:00.40]Can anybody guess?
[106:04.85]No, it's not Sprite.
[106:09.92]No, it's not apple cider.
[106:12.68]Did somebody say it?
[106:13.34]No, it's not bong water.
[106:14.80]Sorry.
[106:18.02]Yeah, you're close.
[106:22.32]You're close.
[106:22.86]It's, you know, somebody... You know, I'm gonna say it.
[106:26.90]My favorite, like, drink to just drink is coconut water.
[106:31.02]And not the bullshit.
[106:31.92]Not the fake shit.
[106:33.40]The real shit.
[106:35.67]Don't make me shoot you!
[106:40.65]Not the fake shit.
[106:41.73]Not the stuff that you buy at the grocery store that pretends to be it.
[106:44.41]I'm talking about the real stuff.
[106:51.39]Is that in there?
[106:54.45]That's awful.
[106:55.61]Do you have any idea how much potassium there is that you don't have to eat bananas ever again?
[106:58.62]There's one right here.
[107:07.03]Where is this one?
[107:07.49]Right here?
[107:17.83]Can I really not, like, smash this into this person?
[107:19.85]I just got uppercutted.
[107:22.83]Oh, the DualShock battery is low.
[107:25.49]And then that just swells.
[107:27.19]Good thing.
[107:27.85]Okay, I very clearly just hit him in the face with this.
[107:45.49]Your immersion is broken.
[107:46.61]I'm sorry.
[107:47.13]Okay, there it is.
[107:49.61]Another component is over here.
[107:51.27]Hold on.
[107:52.35]I have to plug this in in a minute.
[107:57.88]Shamelessly saying that Bacardi rum is... No, don't... Bacardi rum.
[108:06.64]Get out of here with that.
[108:08.58]What is this thing?
[108:09.38]Can I pick it up?
[108:11.78]Ooh, alien artifact collected.
[108:13.30]Collect alien artifacts to help unlock a hidden weapon and other goodies.
[108:17.02]Okay.
[108:20.18]No.
[108:21.28]I don't drink Bacardi rum.
[108:28.04]Who the hell is this thing?
[108:32.12]On top of the building?
[108:41.75]No, it's up there.
[108:43.60]Taller in the first game.
[108:47.30]Rip it off.
[108:48.30]Bring it down.
[108:51.52]I got my fishing pole.
[108:52.40]I'm ready.
[108:55.34]Coconut water is actually good.
[108:57.94]You know what's funny?
[108:59.01]Actually, I didn't like it at first.
[109:00.19]I thought it was gross.
[109:02.47]Did he just call me a crypto-fascist?
[109:11.05]Huh?
[109:15.99]It is gross.
[109:16.49]Well, I mean, it's not really though.
[109:19.89]It's really good for you.
[109:28.41]Guess I can make this thing into an communicator array.
[109:30.70]So many wrong opinions from one person.
[109:33.30]Now, what do I use for a quantum spin resonator?
[109:37.96]Would he get good coconut water?
[109:39.10]As long as it doesn't fall off.
[109:42.48]Now, for the... Do I want to sound like somebody paid for this?
[109:46.71]Take all this, a particle burst accelerator.
[109:50.05]The sensor cell connects to the focal plane.
[109:53.23]The focal plane connects to the plasma beam.
[109:57.31]I know you're waiting for me to sing the damn song.
[110:01.07]You put your coconut water in your bong.
[110:02.69]I got standards.
[110:03.97]They may not be high, but I got them.
[110:05.49]No, I don't eat soy protein.
[110:07.34]Also, we couldn't get the rides.
[110:10.72]Somebody said, like, oh, I'm like a soy man.
[110:12.86]Soy.
[110:13.74]I don't eat soy.
[110:15.64]I don't drink soy protein.
[110:19.24]Ba-da-bing, ba-da-boom.
[110:27.66]Move the antenna to the top of the... Coit Tower.
[110:31.73]To carry this?
[110:36.21]Can I carry this?
[110:38.41]I guess I have to do it from the saucer.
[110:48.84]I bet you drink soy straight from the bottle.
[110:53.42]No, I don't.
[110:58.95]You want like protein?
[111:01.43]Eat a steak.
[111:03.35]Have some tuna fish.
[111:04.47]Eat some spinach.
[111:13.18]Eat a burnt steak.
[111:15.74]Have some almonds.
[111:18.24]Eat some spinach protein.
[111:24.01]I don't drink Soylent.
[111:25.01]I've tried Soylent before.
[111:26.09]We already had the Soylent conversation.
[111:29.94]It's like a hundred bucks a month to drink Soylent, like, once every other day.
[111:34.54]Alright, let's pick it up.
[111:47.19]Yes, I've tried it.
[111:55.31]After you drink that shit, like, every day, though, it's like...
[112:00.81]Oh, it's just like it's just it's just to feel bad just to feel bad Weird noises Because you don't even realize how much of that stuff you're drinking either
[112:29.26]Those things are like a full meal in a bottle.
[112:32.66]A little chocolate, yummy chocolate, shaky!
[112:36.12]I drank three today?
[112:38.47]Oh, fuck.
[112:40.37]I shouldn't do that.
[112:41.11]Alright, let's bend the antenna.
[112:55.17]You know, instead of drinking Soylent, you eat a couple of beets, you know what I mean?
[113:04.36]Just go to the store.
[113:06.28]Don't get your nutrition from a fucking plastic bottle.
[113:11.12]Go to the store, get a fucking handful of spinach, get a couple of beets.
[113:16.26]Sprinkle some feta cheese on there and chop it up and eat it.
[113:21.83]Don't get your nutrition out of a fucking bottle.
[113:26.05]No, man, it's great.
[113:27.05]See, they grind it all up and they process it in a fucking plant.
[113:30.09]And then they package it in bottles and you drink your nutrition.
[113:33.16]It's perfect.
[113:35.59]Probably not I have no idea just drink apple juice boy.
[113:38.05]No, I mean Do anything else?
[114:04.34]You essentially are paying an extreme fee for someone to just blend up a bunch of food in a blender and put it in a bottle for you.
[114:12.39]You don't have to do that.
[114:18.86]Jesus.
[114:27.12]Who's talking right now?
[114:28.26]Why is someone blasting my ears with nonsense?
[114:30.92]GTA Radio.
[114:37.11]Just eat like a handful of fucking walnuts.
[114:42.04]Don't worry, you're gonna be fine.
[114:47.76]And guess what?
[114:48.26]Walnuts are like dirt cheap.
[114:50.76]Get like a fucking bulk bag of walnuts.
[115:03.60]Crunch him up in your mouth like once a day.
[115:07.04]And spend like seven dollars.
[115:10.34]Ow.
[115:14.44]This thing is like going down here.
[115:18.71]Oh my.
[115:22.99]Nuts aren't cheap.
[115:25.43]You guys are fucking disgusting.
[115:27.67]I should ban that.
[115:29.30]I should ban what I just saw.
[115:31.02]But you know what?
[115:33.71]Lobbying for big farm of walnut.
[115:37.93]I'm gonna die here.
[115:41.32]Watch out for the missiles.
[115:44.02]And I just got hit by every single one of them.
[116:12.54]Plugging coconut pharmaceuticals.
[116:17.46]You know, I feel the same way about Soylent that I do about Loot Crate.
[116:24.50]I wonder how many people are paid to tell you to buy Soylent.
[116:27.91]It's like the same thing with Loot Crate.
[116:29.01]I don't think anybody has ever bought Loot Crate.
[116:31.43]I think it's just like the sponsorships.
[116:34.39]Has anybody ever bought it?
[116:38.43]Or is it just like a bunch of pretend, like, marketing volume?
[116:44.09]I mean, I bought it.
[116:48.84]This is fucking ridiculous, man.
[116:52.66]I'm about to die.
[116:53.78]Can I get, like, health somewhere?
[116:55.94]Jesus, man, this is bad.
[117:12.50]I need to, like, gain some health here.
[117:13.72]Do I have, like, a heal?
[117:16.40]I don't think I even have a heal.
[117:18.60]Jesus, man.
[117:18.86]Wow!
[117:18.94]I take, like, one or two more hits and I'm fucking dead.
[117:21.20]Oh, right.
[117:22.12]I can pick up the cars.
[117:23.26]Wow.
[117:42.69]Jesus, holy shit.
[117:44.31]I mean, look, if you got, like, the money to spend on drinking, like, a Soylent every day, then good for you.
[117:49.96]But for those of us that, you know, want to just eat beets?
[118:04.53]There's always the beats section of the grocery store Beats cost more Beats have more money, no they're not
[118:37.99]And honestly, let me continue to bash a company on stream.
[118:45.03]And that's apparently what I'm doing.
[118:47.55]They made a movie about Soylent being made out of human beings.
[118:52.49]You know what I mean?
[118:52.97]Like, hey, I got an idea.
[118:53.75]Let's think of something we should make for a good name that'll catch people's attention.
[118:58.07]Oh, I know.
[118:58.43]How about the thing that Charlton Heston said was made out of other humans?
[119:13.58]Spoiler.
[119:14.20]That movie is fucking royalty free right now.
[119:17.32]Like, I'm sorry.
[119:18.66]If you haven't heard who Mickey Mouse is before he's in public domain, that ain't my problem.
[119:24.78]Got odd jobs, okay.
[119:36.41]Odd job.
[119:38.49]Oh, I can't.
[119:39.25]I have to, like, lose this.
[119:40.65]I gotta lose this heat.
[119:42.39]Let's see if I can do it.
[119:44.43]Oh, definitely not from that part.
[119:48.68]Make him dance!
[119:49.14]Make him dance!
[119:49.56]Make him dance!
[119:49.98]Make him dance!
[119:52.70]Got it!
[119:59.81]Yes!
[120:02.87]Your check from Big Beat is in the mail.
[120:08.52]I'll tell you, though.
[120:16.07]Having something you can bring to work.
[120:19.09]Okay, let's talk about pros versus cons.
[120:20.58]Here's a pro.
[120:20.98]This is the only one that I can think of.
[120:23.77]Like, you're at the desk.
[120:25.29]It's like hard day's work.
[120:27.74]Some of your bosses up your ass, down your throat.
[120:31.00]Gotta get that shit done, Johnson.
[120:32.44]And you're like, God damn it.
[120:35.02]And he's like, you don't get a lunch break.
[120:37.48]Well, first of all, that's illegal.
[120:38.59]You'd have discourse to sue that person.
[120:40.85]But, you know, if you had a soylent behind you in the fridge, take it out and just drink it.
[120:44.59]There you go.
[120:44.99]You're gonna be fine for like another few hours.
[120:48.14]On a road trip.
[120:49.34]Ah, there's no food for like the next 10 miles.
[120:51.62]We just, Pat, we're in like Kentucky on the highway.
[120:53.60]Get yourself a swine lip there.
[120:56.09]You'll be fine.
[120:56.79]Got all the nutrition you need.
[121:06.97]There are 200 calories in one pound of beets.
[121:09.30]And a pound of beets is about two to... Hold on a second, Spencer.
[121:11.68]Are you about to fucking ruin my whole thing here?
[121:14.47]There are 200 calories in one pound of beets, and a pound of beets is $2.50.
[121:19.27]So you'd have to spend about $25 to get your daily 2,000 calories from beets, but a 400-calorie bottle of Soylent costs $2.42.
[121:27.25]So you need five, which means Soylent costs $12 per day.
[121:33.49]No, but you don't just eat beets.
[121:35.07]You don't just eat beets for fucking breakfast, lunch, and dinner.
[121:38.10]You don't drink food.
[121:40.63]I told you, go to the store, get the biggest hunk of broccoli you can find.
[121:46.46]Chop it up.
[121:47.82]Boil it.
[121:48.44]Boil it.
[121:48.92]Saute it.
[121:49.48]Do whatever you want.
[121:50.00]Put it in a box.
[121:51.20]You got like an $8 box of like a week of broccoli.
[121:54.66]You're gonna take your soylent out and like drizzle it on there for like a fucking Caesar salad.
[121:59.73]Without the Caesar salad, it's too expensive.
[122:03.03]Go get yourself a ton of vegetables and like fucking smash them all together in a pot and boil them.
[122:07.87]And you'll have food for two months.
[122:11.33]What's wrong?
[122:11.93]Did I say ruin her life?
[122:13.01]Maybe I can help.
[122:14.87]Thanks, but I don't need any help ruining my life.
[122:18.24]Are you sure?
[122:19.76]I'm really pretty good at it.
[122:21.64]Yeah, but eating a beet is not the same.
[122:24.34]It's not the same as drinking Soylent out of the can.
[122:28.16]No, a beet is real.
[122:31.08]It wasn't made in a factory.
[122:33.50]Somebody reached down onto the beet bush and pulled it off and wiped it with a cloth and put it in a basket.
[122:43.94]Hold on, I'm gonna lose my... I'm gonna lose my Disguiser.
[122:52.60]Hold on.
[122:58.18]Fuck.
[122:58.70]It's not the same.
[123:04.88]That's like saying, for real, that, like, you're gonna try to argue with me.
[123:09.20]Hey, why, uh...
[123:11.57]Why wouldn't you... Why would you just drink apple juice?
[123:16.29]Drink Mott's apple juice.
[123:18.00]Don't eat an apple.
[123:20.00]That's so... That's completely different things.
[123:22.06]One of them is so much more better for you.
[123:23.28]One of them is so much more good for you.
[123:26.66]You can't argue that with me.
[123:30.10]What am I supposed to do with her?
[123:33.31]Did I... I already missed it.
[123:35.01]What was I supposed to do?
[123:35.71]Follow her?
[123:36.21]Scan her?
[123:38.56]Beet, nut, salad.
[123:42.46]I mean, yeah, beets, walnuts, feta cheese, and a little bit of spinach.
[123:54.13]That's it.
[123:54.41]Alright, let's go to the hippie gathering.
[123:58.27]Is she coming with me?
[124:01.87]How do I get her to follow me?
[124:03.17]Look for grounds of smelly hippies standing around.
[124:09.69]Let's go.
[124:11.63]Look for smelly hippie grounds.
[124:24.12]Okay.
[124:29.13]Drinking anything but water is for fucking idiots?
[124:34.55]That's not true either.
[124:38.98]Look, juices are good too.
[124:40.26]Like a smoothie, you grind up your own apples, grind up some ginger and some carrots.
[124:46.14]That's good.
[124:49.32]Alright, I'm looking for smelly hippies.
[124:52.10]I guess that's what it said.
[124:53.26]I didn't say that.
[124:53.76]That's what the game said.
[124:59.00]Coffee is good too.
[125:01.33]How do they make coffee, guys?
[125:03.36]They don't put it in a bottle and ship it across the world.
[125:06.68]No, somebody reaches into the coffee bush and pulls out the huge coffee nut.
[125:12.25]And then they smash it with a giant hammer and package it and send it around the world.
[125:25.25]Okay, you're still following me, right?
[125:26.77]Yeah.
[125:29.11]Looking for hippie grounds.
[125:30.75]Can I see what she has to think?
[125:31.75]Alright, I need to... Um... Hmm.
[125:55.98]He says, the guy that drinks sugary Dunkin' Donuts every stream.
[126:00.71]That's where I paused the game.
[126:01.65]And that's where we put the controller down.
[126:05.17]Listen to me.
[126:05.95]Excuse me.
[126:07.60]I don't put any sugar in my coffee.
[126:09.36]Zero.
[126:11.06]I put... Sometimes I just drink it black.
[126:14.53]I just get a cold brew black.
[126:16.45]I don't put extra sugar in my coffee.
[126:18.07]Don't do that.
[126:18.85]I don't do that kind of thing.
[126:20.59]CBBB is blueberry flavoring.
[126:22.25]There's no sugar in it.
[126:23.13]There's no added sugar.
[126:24.05]There probably is.
[126:25.00]But I don't put added... Almond milk with hazelnut.
[126:30.02]No sugar.
[126:30.70]Don't put any added sugar.
[126:33.66]And a lot of times I just drink it black.
[126:38.84]How dare you accuse me of putting sugar in my coffee?
[126:42.88]How dare you?
[126:45.58]I have to prove it.
[126:46.28]Fine, I'll go order it right now.
[126:48.47]I'll be back in like 20 minutes.
[126:50.35]Alright.
[126:51.15]Look at the hippies.
[126:54.93]This looks like hippie buses.
[126:57.13]Right?
[126:59.56]Ah, got it.
[127:00.10]I'm picking up the hippie scent.
[127:06.14]Coffee's so bright.
[127:07.00]It's because there's almond milk in it a lot.
[127:09.73]I get almond milk, and that's not bad.
[127:12.93]What's wrong with almond milk?
[127:14.99]You know, guess what?
[127:15.95]They crush a bunch of almonds and turn it into milk and Ster it up.
[127:21.55]Make her dance with the hippies.
[127:30.21]Now watch her make an idiot of herself, okay?
[127:35.20]There's a party in my pants.
[127:38.12]Almond milk is like soylent.
[127:40.98]That's not true.
[127:43.37]It's not true.
[127:43.91]It's not soy milk.
[127:44.81]It's nuts.
[127:45.81]That's nuts.
[127:48.87]Not going to say the second part of that because obviously the internet exists.
[127:54.09]And we all know how that would end up.
[127:56.50]So the milk from a almond milk
[128:03.02]Is what I'm going to say there.
[128:04.07]Okay.
[128:04.41]Secretary.
[128:05.49]Exhibitionism.
[128:06.15]Outrage.
[128:06.73]Corporate woman turns public park into filthy pleasure den.
[128:13.57]Thank you for the five Fjordatex.
[128:19.91]We have done all we can do.
[128:23.07]I wish there was a fucking blast guy and mouth button.
[128:25.72]I would have just done it.
[128:33.98]This whole stream has been so lewd.
[128:45.19]Not because of me.
[128:46.03]I didn't say it.
[128:48.11]Blame the other chatters that are here.
[128:49.67]I'm just one of the chatters.
[128:51.23]Yes, I might be in control of the avatar character that's on the screen right now.
[128:54.85]I have my avatar on the screen.
[128:57.67]But I'm just currently talking with you guys.
[129:03.74]It was 100% me.
[129:04.72]No, I wasn't.
[129:05.32]I said words and you guys replaced my words and added more words.
[129:18.75]Pass the controller, you've been hogging it all stream.
[129:20.75]No, it's my house.
[129:21.77]I get to play first.
[129:25.68]It's my PS2, man.
[129:27.50]In my house.
[129:35.23]Alright, we got another hippie mission.
[129:38.51]Let's talk to Freak again.
[129:44.56]Mom said it's my turn.
[129:45.92]There's 2,500 people waiting to play.
[129:47.42]You don't want to gather in dust in the garage.
[129:50.06]You know what I'm saying?
[130:02.69]This place, it does have two player co-op?
[130:08.67]Oh, that's what it does.
[130:09.37]The streamer plays game on stimulants.
[130:15.28]This all started because I said the words kombucha.
[130:18.22]And everybody lost their minds.
[130:31.52]This was started because of that.
[130:32.74]Sounds like a real firecracker.
[130:35.72]Maybe I should introduce myself.
[130:40.82]Alright.
[130:41.58]I'm off to introduce myself to Prudence.
[130:44.56]See if I can convince her to give up on me.
[130:47.50]I said the word kombucha.
[130:48.84]That's like a word that just sets them all off.
[130:59.03]Find Prudence Kane.
[131:07.00]I need to do this, guys.
[131:12.34]Alert.
[131:13.00]Alert.
[131:13.68]Alert.
[131:15.22]Dance it off, man.
[131:15.82]You'll be fine.
[131:18.06]Alright, so... As the 1920s barbershop guy, where do I go?
[131:24.61]Barber is the correct word.
[131:26.83]Alright, we have a... Find Prudence Cane.
[131:31.91]Do you know anything about Prudence Kane?
[131:34.07]Hippie.
[131:35.23]At the park.
[131:35.67]Turn left at the end of this road, then turn right at the end of that one.
[131:40.67]Okay.
[132:01.28]When does the Cuphead DLC... Somebody just mentioned Cuphead.
[132:03.04]When does that DLC come out?
[132:05.16]I'm looking forward to that.
[132:05.90]That game is fantastic.
[132:11.42]Have they announced it yet or anything?
[132:16.75]It's already out?
[132:17.53]No, it's not.
[132:28.31]I went the complete wrong way.
[132:30.99]What a fucking bonehead.
[132:34.11]Hey.
[132:34.96]Wanna see something fucking weird, man?
[132:40.82]I'll never see it again.
[132:41.70]This guy's already dead.
[132:46.78]That's great.
[132:47.64]Oh, shit.
[132:56.53]Done.
[132:59.60]Coming out in the future.
[133:00.48]Well, I mean, yeah, but when in the future?
[133:02.18]What time and where can I get it?
[133:06.97]What's going... I feel like I just... Alright.
[133:09.79]Anybody else feel like they just got out of the pool?
[133:12.51]Look at the trees in the background.
[133:13.57]Look at the telephone pole here.
[133:14.63]It has that, like, triple vision on it.
[133:17.56]It's, like, very fuzzy and floaty around the pole.
[133:19.72]Like, I feel like I just had to put a bunch of chlorine in my eyes.
[133:21.86]Move it or lose it, Jack.
[133:30.97]Almost there.
[133:36.64]Let's get a little bit more info on the hippies.
[133:41.38]The stage, okay.
[133:41.84]Got another one of those.
[133:42.54]Alien genome 4% complete.
[133:43.72]Well, I need a lot more of those.
[133:59.27]Alright, well, their prudence is up there.
[134:00.87]Let's just steal a hippie outfit.
[134:06.41]Now everybody dance.
[134:18.20]Peace, love, and all that stuff.
[134:19.24]Yeah, let's go.
[134:23.22]Dragon crack.
[134:27.14]Ooh.
[134:29.72]Bring it over here!
[134:32.78]An easy escape!
[134:35.77]Let's get onto the hippie... uh, compound, or whatever this is.
[134:39.63]Alright, there's Prudence.
[134:43.05]Should I, like... find her?
[134:45.92]Okay, well I found her.
[134:47.78]Should I knock?
[134:48.20]Maybe I shouldn't be on the stage.
[134:49.34]No, we're fine.
[134:59.30]Why is the guy on the banner just a Will Forte character?
[135:03.10]Is this an ad for Last Man on Earth?
[135:08.09]Looks just like him.
[135:11.73]Was it a bad show?
[135:12.79]I've never even watched it.
[135:28.85]Where's Bongwater?
[135:30.15]Sadly, our leader, Coyote Bongwater, cannot be with us today because he is setting in motion a grand design to transform this entire city into a counter-cultural utopia.
[135:51.27]Bay City is about to become one big, happy city.
[136:00.11]What's in this game about daddies?
[136:02.33]Game doesn't stop with it.
[136:04.30]Well, there's giant containers of it everywhere.
[136:24.46]Alright.
[136:24.94]Here comes another shoot-the-balloon mission.
[136:31.00]That's not creepy at all.
[136:51.80]Those Revelade trucks could be a serious pain in my ass.
[136:56.06]And I haven't blown anything up for at least 10 minutes.
[136:59.04]He's got a point.
[137:03.68]Destroy the Revelade trucks.
[137:05.61]I will gladly do that.
[137:08.81]Inside of my ship.
[137:10.31]First, let me... Let me throw up out of this person.
[137:19.58]And... Enter.
[137:25.18]Let's go.
[137:25.50]Boom.
[137:31.69]And boom.
[137:33.93]Find his lair.
[137:38.33]That's easier said than done.
[137:41.17]I didn't even need to do that.
[137:44.11]I guess we didn't even... I didn't need to do what I just did.
[137:46.65]Okay, we're good.
[137:56.06]Ooh, that's a double shotgun here.
[137:57.42]Alright, move around.
[137:59.12]No, no, no, no, no.
[138:01.14]Get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out, get out.
[138:06.05]I think that's gonna get some dancing going here.
[138:08.51]Oh, this is bad.
[138:09.31]Very bad.
[138:09.79]I'm gonna fucking die.
[138:14.03]Turn around and just get out!
[138:15.07]Give me some shields!
[138:18.04]No!
[138:26.65]He's probably in one of these houses here.
[138:35.82]Come on!
[138:41.28]Okay.
[138:43.73]Now we can scan and find out where his house is.
[138:45.85]If I die, I have to pass the controller.
[138:50.39]That's alright.
[138:50.95]I am not going to die.
[138:54.42]It's like winning the lottery.
[138:55.92]It's like winning the kombucha lottery.
[138:57.64]He's got a secret lair.
[138:59.76]Hmm.
[138:59.96]Hmm.
[139:20.84]Underpass under the hill.
[139:23.59]Anybody else know anything?
[139:30.75]I guess I gotta go that way.
[139:38.32]Scan hippies.
[139:40.54]That's what I plan on doing.
[139:43.83]Who puts a church of enlightenment underground?
[139:47.12]It's like meditating in the underworld.
[139:49.50]Fong water ought to spruce the place up a little.
[139:53.58]Damn, fuck you guys.
[139:55.62]No, don't just move this down.
[139:58.56]Alright, come on, Dumbledore.
[140:01.49]I'll make that reference in a second.
[140:02.93]Hold on.
[140:12.56]What is wrong with her?
[140:16.99]I don't need to pass the controller.
[140:25.23]Are you fucking serious, man?
[140:31.91]Why can nobody dance?
[140:33.36]Dance!
[140:35.98]Okay, here's what I was trying to say.
[140:38.76]Watch this.
[140:43.63]You know when Dumbledore comes out and he confronts Tom Riddle as Voldemort.
[140:49.37]Oh, fuck you.
[140:50.56]No, wait.
[140:53.22]Just fucking forget it.
[140:55.14]I'm making a Harry Potter wand duel beam joke.
[140:58.08]That's it.
[140:58.58]That's all you need to know.
[140:59.30]You'll see it and then I can be done and we can move on.
[141:11.04]Okay, let's go.
[141:14.94]It's up here.
[141:17.52]Come on, PlayStation.
[141:18.42]Don't do that.
[141:18.90]Alright, there we go.
[141:19.55]Straight ahead.
[141:19.95]I want to scan the hippie.
[141:24.51]Make sure I get the exact location.
[141:26.73]It's definitely right here.
[141:28.37]That wasn't a failed joke.
[141:45.69]So close.
[141:50.50]Hmm.
[141:51.78]I think I found it.
[141:55.58]Cosplaying as Ronald McDonald.
[141:57.10]Oh.
[141:59.26]There's a boss.
[142:12.23]Please don't bounce.
[142:13.53]Whoa, I got that thing.
[142:17.35]Nothing's going to be out of control here.
[142:20.67]I swear to God, I just heard the Luigi got hit by something sound.
[142:27.84]Is that like... Did you hear it?
[142:34.36]No, it's not your turn.
[142:39.52]Just listen for it.
[142:41.76]Okay.
[142:50.77]He just like hippied me.
[142:53.01]Okay, I gotta get a better plan for this.
[142:57.39]Can I blow these up?
[143:05.19]Hold on, let me just chill here for a second.
[143:06.57]Come on, fill up.
[143:08.73]There we go.
[143:20.85]God damn it, he did it again.
[143:21.82]Shit.
[143:21.92]I gotta take out his, like, little goons first.
[143:26.44]Really?
[143:26.58]Watch out for that.
[143:27.08]Good.
[143:27.46]Now we... Whatever.
[143:52.43]Oh, shit, it exploded.
[143:56.37]Hide.
[143:57.27]It's right there.
[144:26.90]He turned clearly into a skeleton right there.
[144:29.98]Alright, I'll give Chad a turn after this.
[144:37.39]I'll pass the controller.
[144:38.93]I did die.
[144:39.73]You guys get a turn.
[144:48.23]and return to the Soviet Union with the spacecraft fragments we have managed to retrieve.
[144:54.77]But what about freeing America from the tyranny of capitalist consumerism?
[145:01.06]Do not despair, comrade.
[145:03.06]The party will long remember your efforts to cripple your decadent nation.
[145:08.08]You shall not have died in vain.
[145:09.70]Orange, you're not.
[145:13.52]No.
[145:15.03]No!
[145:16.29]I wanted to save America!
[145:19.59]Like a scoop!
[145:21.21]That was a good joke in chat, I liked it.
[145:31.48]That wasn't my joke, that was somebody else's.
[145:32.98]Dead.
[145:33.14]Mmm, more weapons.
[145:49.15]Give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me, give me.
[145:53.75]Disintegrator ray data core retrieved.
[145:56.39]Escape bong water bay.
[145:59.04]We've collected the disintegrator ray, a powerful weapon, but one that requires ammo.
[146:02.10]You can replenish your ammo by using transmog.
[146:06.26]Hold L1 to walk onto a vehicle or an inanimate object.
[146:10.36]While holding L1, press X to transmog it.
[146:21.00]okay that's cool uh disintegrate it allows you to fry your opponents it is most effective against humans but also can destroy vehicles and other inanimate objects yes it can watch out for that human
[146:51.72]He's dead.
[146:55.11]Don't you dare talk about height.
[146:58.37]You're gonna really get me all hot and bothered.
[147:05.85]One hit.
[147:06.19]Let's see.
[147:06.61]Let's just mow him down.
[147:07.65]Yeah, this thing's very effective.
[147:10.91]Let me just get some disintegrator ammo here.
[147:17.20]I can transmog while they're in it.
[147:22.17]Well, that's a very effective way to do this.
[147:27.09]Is it not working?
[147:34.03]Oh, we have to break it all the way down.
[147:37.10]I get it.
[147:37.60]Okay.
[147:42.64]Just dance!
[147:49.31]Uh, that's fun.
[147:50.91]That's a fun thing to do.
[147:52.07]Alright, where'd it go?
[147:52.81]Come here.
[147:53.01]Let's turn into this guy.
[147:58.24]Have you seen me?
[147:59.20]Whatever they are, they're... Forget what you've seen.
[148:05.40]You forget too.
[148:07.52]And you.
[148:10.22]And... There's too many people here to do this to.
[148:14.99]Let's do the forget bomb on everybody.
[148:16.42]Alright, let's go.
[148:17.92]Oh, wait, hold on.
[148:18.28]There's one of those faces here.
[148:19.38]What would you like?
[148:22.18]And now I know why everything's getting so lewd.
[148:25.12]It's because... It's like this guy keeps talking about sexual stuff.
[148:48.35]Um... Is this what you were looking for?
[148:54.25]Okay, one.
[148:58.12]Uh... This is PG-13.

[150:53.07]Let's get them both.
[150:53.89]Because the ship needs... I feel like the hardest missions are the ones when you're inside the saucer, so... Let's do cooldown speed as well.
[151:07.94]I actually have enough to do this.
[151:08.96]Disintegrate array.
[151:10.16]Disintegrate array.

[157:36.05]Unlock the crypto art gallery in the archives.
[157:42.04]That's all I got now.
[157:43.26]Okay, I guess I get two more.
[157:44.38]Two more urban.
[157:46.74]Let's just get it.
[157:47.50]We're already here.
[157:52.02]That's hippie.
[157:54.54]Hippie, hippie, urban.

[158:27.63]A new one.
[158:29.67]It's the Fuzz.
[158:31.21]Aw, he just keeps adding.
[158:33.23]Body snatch Bay City police at twice the rate.
[158:37.60]Not army.
[158:38.24]It's never gonna end.
[158:40.54]But there probably are a lot of army men here, so... I would take a guess and say that that would be the case.
[158:47.76]Not that I can see...
[158:58.17]Where are they?
[158:58.85]Ah, screw it.
[159:02.04]Let's go do another one of these missions.
[159:05.60]What's the end goal of the abduction stuff?
[159:08.54]From my understanding, it just keeps letting you unlock more stuff to do.
[159:13.30]More upgrades.
[159:16.08]It's pretty much the upgrade machine.
[159:19.04]To let you drain people faster, scan them faster probably, body snatch them faster, all kinds of stuff.
[159:34.78]Let's do this, since we're already over here.
[159:38.26]Might as well.
[159:39.08]Let's see how much better this is.
[159:41.56]It really is that much faster.
[159:47.29]Very fast now.
[159:47.83]That's good.
[159:51.89]Alright, eyeballs.
[159:53.31]It's you.
[159:55.49]Convince the flippies.
[159:59.02]To do what exactly?
[160:00.20]I'm not sure.
[160:04.43]I thought it said ask about his gains.
[160:07.05]Okay.
[160:07.43]Same person.
[160:07.83]Okay.
[160:29.57]You know, I... I'm gonna get sushi.
[160:39.00]I'm in a sushi mood right now.
[160:41.66]First... The first roll that somebody says is the thing I'm gonna buy.
[160:44.50]I swear to God.
[160:45.82]Give me, like, a sushi roll that you like.
[160:47.50]First... The first fucking thing I see.
[160:51.73]Spicy tuna, you got it.
[160:52.59]Done.
[160:58.77]Done.
[160:59.57]That sounds... That sounds great.
[161:01.43]Okay, now what?
[161:08.94]Um... Do I have to, like, scan?
[161:22.59]Okay.
[161:28.78]Okay, so she's farting.
[161:31.50]What does that do for me?
[161:35.48]What did he say?
[161:36.12]I wasn't paying attention.
[161:37.48]Hey, man.
[161:38.26]What can I do you for?
[161:42.49]Could I body snatch her?
[161:43.27]Wouldn't they all freak out?
[161:45.99]So, uh... No.
[161:47.37]Bug off, man.
[161:48.35]Oh, you're the flippy.
[161:51.25]Rainbow honeysuckle.
[161:52.75]I'll beat it, will ya?
[161:54.05]Okay, got it.
[161:54.51]I'm not gonna get Mercury poisoning.
[162:06.23]Somebody's gonna get hit by a car.
[162:07.99]They don't care about that?
[162:08.77]We'll just start dancing.
[162:13.59]They're so stoned, they don't give a shit.
[162:23.58]Ask about the, uh, next roll gets added.
[162:25.67]I'm getting two rolls.
[162:26.61]Quick!
[162:51.29]What's wrong with you guys?
[162:57.30]What the fuck?
[162:58.66]Stop it!
[163:00.44]You guys seriously need to... You guys need to go to... Go to your room.
[163:14.67]Go to your room.
[163:15.69]You're grounded.
[163:18.21]You know, we could be doing a lot more to bring free love to the world.
[163:24.01]You're grounded.
[163:24.95]We're flippies.
[163:26.51]Free love is right there in the name.
[163:29.12]But we've only got 13 members.
[163:31.88]You ask me, we can't give this stuff away.
[163:35.52]Well, everybody says they want free love.
[163:38.14]But nobody wants to commit.
[163:40.22]Which, admittedly, is sort of the point.
[163:42.87]Well, you don't get to leave it.
[163:44.31]You know what would totally help sell this whole free love thing?
[163:49.59]Ark voodoo.
[163:52.23]What's an ark voodoo?
[163:56.18]Alright, so somebody says Philadelphia roll.
[163:58.10]Yeah, right?
[163:58.66]Okay, well that's what I said.
[163:59.96]So I want to go... I'm going to get a Philadelphia roll.
[164:04.08]Which is good.
[164:04.64]I love the Philadelphia roll.
[164:08.18]What's going on?
[164:09.14]Why?
[164:09.22]What do you mean, why?
[164:11.18]Philadelphia roll is good.
[164:12.46]It's...
[164:26.85]It's tuna, avocado, cucumber, and cream cheese rolled up.
[164:35.45]And if you just want a Boston roll, just leave the cream cheese as a Boston roll.
[164:47.42]It sounds amazing because it is.
[164:49.68]Next time you're at a sushi restaurant, order a Philadelphia roll.
[164:53.61]They don't like load it with cream cheese.
[164:55.45]It's like a little square.
[164:57.27]They cut a little square of Philadelphia cream cheese and they stick it in the middle.
[165:02.16]Raw salmon, cucumbers and avocado with, you know, in rice with a seaweed wrap.
[165:08.38]It's great.
[165:11.83]Through Ark, Voodle, I comprehend the meaning of the universe.
[165:16.48]Sushi and cream cheese is a disgrace.
[165:17.90]Big deal, man.
[165:18.62]We all feel like that when we're stoned.
[165:20.52]What's wrong with that?
[165:22.14]It changes the palette a little.
[165:26.04]You eat, like, lox and bagels, don't you?
[165:28.84]It's kind of like the... It's like doing that.
[165:35.44]Try a different selling point.
[165:36.68]Sell him hard.
[165:39.15]Ark Voodle is the best high there is.
[165:42.35]All he needs is your love.
[165:45.09]I don't eat tentacle.
[165:48.37]I don't eat anything with more than five legs.
[165:50.73]I don't.
[165:53.93]That is a slippery spider.
[165:56.31]It's just a gooey spider.
[165:57.47]That's all you're eating.
[166:00.13]The great Ark Voodle has imbued me with special healing powers.
[166:06.45]Oh, yeah?
[166:07.47]Like what?
[166:08.61]Let's just say my spaceship can help you fly like never before, if you know what I mean.
[166:15.53]What, it has more than five legs?
[166:16.77]Are you, like, saying you're from space?
[166:19.51]That's... That's crab and lobster.
[166:25.16]Look.
[166:31.96]That's crab... That's crab and... That's crab and... Crab and lobster.
[166:42.69]Crab has like, what, six legs?
[166:45.05]Five legs?
[166:47.42]No, they got six legs.
[166:49.26]Crab has how many legs?
[166:54.46]Yeah, that's crab.
[166:55.82]Crab has five legs.
[166:57.69]And it has three extra, it has two extra arms.
[166:59.73]I don't need anything with more than six legs.
[167:06.71]There you go.
[167:14.31]I'm so glad people are calling me out on this bullshit right now.
[167:20.23]I eat crab, but I don't eat lobster.
[167:26.74]Unless you don't tell... I'll eat lobster mac and cheese.
[167:30.14]I don't like eating lobster.
[167:31.24]It disgusts me.
[167:35.06]Crabs are alright.
[167:35.95]But still, even still.
[167:37.13]It's gotta be leg.
[167:38.99]Crab legs I'll eat.
[167:40.03]Crab body, get it away from me.
[167:42.87]I won't eat lobster, but I will.
[167:49.75]You've never had lobster mac and cheese?
[167:51.23]Oh my god!
[167:51.71]Far out, man!
[167:52.97]Far out!
[168:09.74]I like the way the crab tastes more than I like the way the lobster tastes.
[168:13.44]What about shrimp?
[168:14.18]I'll eat shrimp, yeah.
[168:15.12]As long as they take out the vein.
[168:17.48]Don't be a disgusting... Just... Diarrhea dump of a restaurant and don't leave that vein in or I will actually complain.
[168:29.27]If I get shrimp and it's from a nice restaurant and the fucking vein is still in there... Hey, waiter!
[168:34.21]Excuse me!
[168:35.77]Get this fucking vein out of, get these veins out of my shrimp, amateur.
[168:39.75]And then I fucking slash it onto the table.
[168:42.15]I smash it up and the glass shatters.
[168:55.23]It's the waiter's phone.
[169:00.20]No, yeah, you know the vein we talked, people thought I was crazy when I said this.
[169:04.27]Everyone thinks that I'm crazy when I say true statements.
[169:07.49]The vein that's in the shrimp is how they shit.
[169:13.45]That dark vein that goes all the way from the head all the way down to the back is where they go to the bathroom.
[169:19.67]That's shit.
[169:21.43]So if you don't take the vein out, you are eating shrimp shit.
[169:31.05]Blue meters!
[169:31.94]Blue meters!
[169:36.20]who cares I guess you know I guess that's true who cares you know I guess that is like who cares have I ever ate a clam belly nope I don't eat clam bellies I don't need whole clams clam necks maybe clam strips maybe no not whole clam bellies inside of there that's what they
[170:09.94]You can't even eat, like, clam mix.
[170:13.75]They're like rubber.
[170:15.35]They're like unedible.
[170:17.25]Alright, where are we going?
[170:22.85]It's like, they're like black tubes that you can't even eat.
[170:26.84]Imagine if you were a restaurant and you sold, like, clam fucking tubes.
[170:32.18]Yeah, that's the best part of clam, man.
[170:34.06]Don't you ever tell me twice.
[170:37.64]Alright, we need to go.
[170:38.48]That's it for that mission.
[170:40.65]I guess, you know, I'm going to go to this.
[170:41.63]Let's do this one too.
[170:50.37]All I've talked about is spiders and seafood.
[170:53.83]Well, sometimes we get on something and we just don't get off of it.
[171:00.25]You know what I mean?
[171:01.35]How many times have we had a conversation that we just cannot get off of?
[171:04.43]Happens a lot.
[171:12.95]Alright, here's another mission here.
[171:14.99]I gotta be like a hippie, don't I?
[171:16.47]Yeah, I gotta convince the yappies.
[171:21.03]We.
[171:23.31]Where do you keep getting we?
[171:25.19]Right, but whatever.
[171:26.61]I'm trying to think of something like gross food that I actually like to eat that a lot of people consider gross.
[171:44.30]I'm not sure.
[171:44.80]Okay, I gotta be like a yappy.
[171:56.61]Some of the chat just said cereal.
[171:58.93]No, you're not- Cereal?
[172:02.89]Oh, this is the guy I need to convince.
[172:06.81]The guy with the shotgun.
[172:08.73]Okay, well, let's get him.
[172:12.69]Hello!
[172:18.72]Trying to think.
[172:19.18]No, I don't really.
[172:21.48]What do I eat that would be considered, like, not... Like, chicken... Or, like, turkey, beef... Hair.
[172:35.07]Yeah, like, what are some things that are not normal to eat?
[172:38.23]Chicken, turkey, beef, hair.
[172:41.89]Um...
[172:44.39]I don't know.
[172:45.77]I'm trying to think of what else I would think is weird.
[172:48.47]Is there a weird company?
[172:49.75]I'm trying to think, like, for real.
[172:51.95]Like, no joking around.
[172:53.47]Uh... No, a lot of foods freak me out.
[173:15.68]I like pudding.
[173:16.40]I've never had blood pudding before, though.
[173:20.99]Fermented soybeans?
[173:29.05]No, no, don't bring up soybeans.
[173:30.28]Oh, no.
[173:30.76]You just... You said the forbidden word.
[173:38.93]I knew it.
[173:40.15]The American revolutionary kindred victims of oppression, defenders of liberty and equality.
[173:48.06]Blood pudding is... Ark voodoo?
[173:51.82]It's, I don't know, it's weird.
[173:52.92]It's kind of like blood sausage, right?
[173:54.20]Honey, you should ask.
[173:56.00]It just so happens to correspond to that of our new benefactors.
[174:04.76]uh stick it to the man man with our poodle he's as anti-establishment as it gets what are you on man I want some that's not correct the yappies couldn't have made it this far without all of you what difference does a name make
[174:26.19]Wouldn't you rather have more resources to fight the good fight?
[174:30.27]Just blood with cornstarch.
[174:31.31]Man, you used to be weird, but now you're kind of groovy.
[174:34.73]I want to hear more.
[174:37.87]Bamboozled their drug-addled minds.
[174:39.83]What haven't I done?
[174:42.11]I'm the original activist.
[174:44.49]My alien god has been on this planet since the dawn of time, damn it.
[174:50.16]No, I don't think there's any weird foods that I really like.
[174:52.08]I'm trying to think of the food categories.
[174:56.80]You think, okay, like beef.
[174:58.20]Like a cow.
[174:59.70]There's no real part of the cow that I haven't eaten.
[175:03.58]Or that I would eat.
[175:04.46]And it's like, oh, that's weird.
[175:05.98]Pork.
[175:06.10]I don't eat pork, though.
[175:06.76]Unless it's bacon.
[175:07.60]No, I only eat bacon.
[175:09.10]I don't eat any other pork.
[175:09.74]I love blue cheese.
[175:10.28]So, you know, that is kind of weird, isn't it?
[175:26.16]Jerma squid is actually really good.
[175:30.86]No, I know.
[175:31.90]I just don't eat it.
[175:33.80]I've had calamari before and it's... I just can't get over the fact that it's like a snot rocket in the ocean.
[175:40.52]It's hard for me to do that.
[175:42.22]Alright, we got these guys on board.
[175:49.58]Get in the saucer.
[175:51.22]Okay.
[175:58.41]Yeah, blue cheese, because blue cheese is kind of weird.
[176:01.55]It's just moldy cheese.
[176:06.94]I've never eaten frog.
[176:07.80]Nope, never had a... Crawfish is essentially shrimp's older brother, right?
[176:12.12]I think I've had it before.
[176:16.56]Cheese is moldy cheese.
[176:17.62]Yeah, but moldy cheese is like real, actual dark pieces of a green and black mold in the cheese.
[176:25.27]Blue cheese is in there.
[176:31.20]Cheese is cheese.
[176:40.49]Alright, put vans on top of the buildings.
[176:47.17]Like, put vans?
[176:49.82]Like, hippie vans?
[176:51.38]I am confused.
[177:05.82]White vans.
[177:10.20]That's not a van.
[177:10.98]That's a truck.
[177:12.46]That's a police car.
[177:15.00]Green vans.
[177:15.84]Red vans.
[177:20.57]Okay, now I get it.
[177:22.49]Not the shoe.
[177:28.45]I need to put them up there.
[177:41.27]Let's make this easy.
[177:43.87]Just dump it in the ocean.
[177:50.87]Oh, I need a van.
[177:52.87]It definitely has to be the hippie vans.
[177:56.00]Sunflower seeds, they're amazing.
[177:58.44]You got the oil in there.
[177:59.58]You gotta chew up that oil and eat it.
[178:02.50]Sunflower seeds have great, great benefits.
[178:04.60]Eat them.
[178:06.56]I recommend them.
[178:11.45]Pumpkin seeds?
[178:12.07]Get him out of here.
[178:15.01]Is this a van or is this a... That's a van, right?
[178:18.53]That's a van.
[178:20.21]Come with me.
[178:22.82]No, sorry, guys.
[178:23.90]I don't trust any food that when you cut it open is slimy and smells like puke.
[178:27.72]I'm sorry.
[178:29.16]It's probably... They're probably really cool.
[178:32.24]Did that not work?
[178:41.85]Yeah, that's what I have to do.
[178:43.23]Well, this mission is kind of... long and boring.
[178:48.87]Whoa!
[178:49.41]Say bye to those people.
[178:52.95]That's every animal.
[178:55.06]No, but something weird about a pumpkin.
[178:59.04]Why is a pumpkin full of all these slimy, gross seeds that it stinks like the inside of a human stomach?
[179:08.80]And they're not alive.
[179:09.68]I mean, well, they are technically alive.
[179:11.80]But they seem really alive.
[179:13.64]That person.
[179:18.34]Ow!
[179:20.34]Escargot, get it away from me.
[179:23.24]I'm not eating snails.
[179:24.94]I'm not eating... Slug, whatever the fuck it is.
[179:31.09]Escargot is like snail shit, right?
[179:32.97]Or snails ground up, or snail eggs, whatever it is.
[179:35.49]No, I don't even want to know what it is.
[179:39.02]There's both of them.
[179:39.72]But they both have like a French name.
[179:42.05]Escargot.
[179:43.81]And... What is the other one?
[179:45.97]It's really expensive.
[179:47.13]It's not calamari.
[179:48.81]Snail and slug.
[179:57.34]Caviar.
[179:57.80]There it is.
[179:58.78]Yeah.
[179:59.14]Fucking slug eggs.
[180:09.30]I'm sorry.
[180:09.66]I can't keep it up anymore.
[180:17.07]There are three vans over there.
[180:18.47]I know.
[180:18.85]I'm just... I'm sorry.
[180:23.53]I'm like bumping the mic right now.
[180:27.21]Give me a van.
[180:31.25]What about gray popcorn?
[180:32.79]Oh, gray poupon.
[180:35.68]Mustard's good.
[180:36.12]I like mustard.
[180:36.66]I like hot mustard.
[180:40.07]You know when you, like, uh... The reason why I'm talking about sushi is because I really love that fake-ass horseradish.
[180:47.12]Um... It's not real.
[180:51.79]It's green.
[180:53.41]They can only sell it in Japan.
[180:54.94]You literally cannot buy it here.
[180:56.82]Wasabi.
[180:59.55]Anytime you get wasabi in the States, it ain't real.
[181:02.43]It's horseradish.
[181:03.17]They dye green.
[181:05.12]But I love that feeling.
[181:06.94]Especially hot mustard and wasabi.
[181:09.42]When you eat a bunch of it.
[181:11.40]You get that feeling that you think you're going to die.
[181:14.22]You know you're going to die.
[181:16.18]Your nose, your nasal passages all flare up and you get this like... Like you're going to die.
[181:21.68]For like 10 seconds.
[181:23.38]I love that feeling.
[181:25.66]I'm missing vans everywhere.
[181:27.80]Oh, I found one.
[181:28.82]I found a van.
[181:29.60]Can I reuse the van?
[181:33.50]Oh, fuck.
[181:34.00]I can't.
[181:37.98]I love that feeling.
[181:38.68]That steep nasal passage burn.
[181:45.84]But here's the thing, though.
[181:46.58]I actually don't like...
[181:49.60]Uh, I do not like hot food.
[181:53.42]Like, I'm not a big fan of spicy hot pepper flavor.
[181:57.07]Or heat.
[182:02.19]I don't like mouth heat, I like nasal heat.
[182:04.47]And you get that from hot mustard and you get that from wasabi.
[182:09.52]I need a fucking van.
[182:15.81]And honestly, I think the nasal heat sometimes is way more intense than like mouth, back of your tongue, back of your throat pepper heat.
[182:30.27]Should I just wait until one spawns?
[182:31.61]I feel like they're not spawning.
[182:37.92]No, that's a tank.
[182:43.56]nasal heat.
[182:45.14]Now, you'll know exactly what I'm talking about.
[182:46.62]If you've never had hot mustard before, or wasabi, if you've just actually never had it, it's a very specific type of inside of your nostrils, down through your, like, the back of your nose pain.
[182:58.87]I haven't skipped any veins.
[182:59.89]There have been none on the screen.
[183:01.69]Stop making me self-confidence.
[183:06.21]Stop making my self-confidence.
[183:11.16]Am I too high?
[183:13.46]No.
[183:14.24]In the game, we're talking.
[183:23.74]Looking for a van.
[183:24.32]Looking for a van.
[183:29.05]I'm looking for a van.
[183:33.39]Anywhere.
[183:33.85]We'll find one.
[183:35.13]This whole... Those streets are just littered with tanks.
[183:40.61]Found a van.
[183:41.47]Look at that.
[183:47.49]I snorted too much horseradish.
[183:50.03]It's good shit, man.
[183:50.80]I like it.
[183:51.06]A lot.
[183:54.96]I like to dip my sushi rolls in the hot mustard.
[184:01.41]And you do like that.
[184:01.97]That's what happens when you take in way too much in your nose.
[184:07.87]You have to breathe out and in really fast in your nose.
[184:10.05]Through your mouth.
[184:13.58]I love it.
[184:25.76]Where are all the fans?
[184:30.32]And funnily enough, it actually is... If you take in hot mustard...
[184:37.52]Not this one, the other one.
[184:38.94]Or wasabi.
[184:40.27]And it's really causing you problems.
[184:42.39]Open your mouth and blow air out of your mouth.
[184:46.23]And, like, don't breathe.
[184:47.17]Like, you want to, like... Because, essentially, it's like gas in your nose.
[184:52.82]It's like the mustard fumes is what's causing that kind of pain.
[184:56.24]So all you have to do is just blow out your mouth.
[185:00.88]And it'll go away.
[185:06.30]It is, I swear to God, look it up.
[185:10.04]I didn't miss three vans.
[185:22.39]He did.
[185:22.87]No, I didn't!
[185:24.17]No, I did not.
[185:31.69]That's a truck.
[185:34.25]Look at that, double van, we're good.
[185:37.33]Oh, you dick.
[185:38.65]No, stop.
[185:46.07]Sometimes I go all in.
[185:47.43]You know what I mean?
[185:50.35]And you take way too much for you to handle.
[185:53.09]And you know it.
[185:54.43]You get that piece of sushi.
[185:55.33]You get the wasabi right there.
[185:56.77]You pick it up.
[185:57.49]You put a dollop of sour cream of wasabi on your piece of sushi.
[186:02.57]And you're like, I'm gonna do it.
[186:03.57]I'm doing it.
[186:04.73]I'm gonna do it.
[186:08.34]And you do way too much.
[186:11.12]And you get that like... I can describe it as... Really, really bad.
[186:19.31]I have to sneeze.
[186:21.41]But it hurts.
[186:22.87]So much.
[186:26.61]It's an extremely painful... Oh my god, I'm about to sneeze.
[186:34.11]Really like that feeling.
[186:34.93]Yeah.
[186:36.33]Yeah.
[186:41.72]Couldn't this have been five?
[186:42.70]Why does it have to be ten?
[186:43.57]Does this count?
[186:46.93]Fuck, I already did this one.
[186:47.87]I was gonna say, why is this up here?
[186:48.91]I, like, put it there.
[186:51.21]Don't fall off.
[186:51.85]You... One day you ate a spoonful of horseradish?
[187:06.56]That's painful.
[187:09.93]I think people have died by eating too much horseradish.
[187:14.63]That actually has killed somebody before, so be careful.
[187:26.58]I missed it again?
[187:27.18]No, I didn't!
[187:28.20]Where?
[187:29.34]What are you talking about?
[187:30.22]There's no van here!
[187:35.05]Stop fucking around.
[187:36.65]There's no van even remotely in this vicinity.
[187:39.85]There's a red truck.
[187:44.50]Alright, I'm just getting fucked with.
[187:47.20]I'm going to a different portion of the city.
[187:53.23]Found one.
[187:54.67]I found this one.
[187:55.37]Nobody else did.
[187:56.69]I saw it.
[188:05.89]Don't follow.
[188:06.85]Good.
[188:10.93]I found that one.
[188:22.33]Alright, I gotta go a little bit slower, because they do spawn in after you get there.
[188:27.87]Every intersection, just gotta hang out for a second.
[188:34.28]This one.
[188:35.12]Let me like suck up the juice from this one though.
[188:45.91]Alright, only a few more.
[188:49.39]This mission is for the birds, I'll tell you that.
[188:52.01]I knew somebody ate a bunch of raw coffee and went to the hospital.
[189:04.28]Well, you mean probably too much caffeine, man.
[189:08.35]Speaking of caffeine, you guys get away from those energy drinks.
[189:10.39]Don't drink those things.
[189:15.32]Talk about, like, too much caffeine and sugar and all kinds of chemicals.
[189:20.54]The energy drink... Energy drinks are just liquid cigarettes.
[189:23.24]I hope you guys realize this.
[189:37.69]Like, you're getting the same health risks of drinking a cigarette by drinking, like, one of those super energy drinks with, like, 50, 60 grams of sugar.
[189:46.32]Like, 200 milligrams of caffeine.
[189:51.12]Like, taurine, chemicals, chemical, chemical, chemical.
[189:56.03]Go to the store.
[189:57.65]Go to the beat section.
[189:58.37]Come on.
[190:14.06]Zero calories.
[190:14.82]Yeah, the team, we're aspartame.
[190:16.54]You don't want aspartame.
[190:20.10]Aspartame is essentially, it's just like, hey, we all know that this shit is really awful.
[190:24.56]It's, every scientist will sit there and go, yeah, don't ever consume that.
[190:28.38]But just put it in all these.
[190:29.40]Zero sugar, man.
[190:30.42]There ain't no sugar in this.
[190:32.72]There's just a terrible disease-causing chemical to make your brain pretend it's eating sugar.
[190:39.64]There's no sugar in there, man.
[190:41.44]There's no sugar in that.
[190:55.62]It's rat poison.
[190:57.40]Hey, at least there's no sugar.
[191:01.92]Pretending to know about food again.
[191:03.28]I don't need to pretend.
[191:05.03]Go look up like energy drink fucking health problem.
[191:09.71]This shit like rots your brain.
[191:13.11]Studies have shown that drinking one energy drink is like watching 60 hours of cartoons.
[191:22.06]That's a study.
[191:22.68]I didn't do it.
[191:23.34]They did.
[191:38.14]Geez, alright, for the amount of time- for the amount of you guys fuck with me on stream, I- I- I do a little- a little jab, and all of a sudden I'm like a murderer.
[191:52.62]Studies from where?
[191:53.11]The Institute of Modern Medicine.
[191:54.43]I need one more fucking van.
[192:18.13]This is the worst mission ever.
[192:19.76]It really is.
[192:20.40]This mission sucks.
[192:24.88]Hold on.
[192:25.22]I need to stand still.
[192:26.00]There we go.
[192:26.48]They just spawn in random spots.
[192:37.71]Do I like string beans?
[192:38.61]Of course I do.
[192:39.79]They're very good.
[192:43.58]I'm just blind?
[192:44.52]No, I'm not.
[192:46.30]I want the people in the VOD to know the truth.
[192:55.17]Look up, it's my car.
[192:56.05]Yappies claim responsibility for daring rooftop car stunt.
[193:02.97]All those VOD watchers right now are going to be typing in the VOD chat like, yeah, man, there weren't very many of those and he only missed like one.
[193:10.31]What's wrong with chat?
[193:11.11]What's going on with chat lately, man?
[193:12.69]What's happening with chat lately?
[193:14.41]You guys notice this?
[193:15.11]I kind of feel like I want to do all these.
[193:32.26]Where's my speed boost?
[193:33.88]Well, that's different.
[193:34.86]That's a cloaking device.
[193:37.82]So left trigger is a cloak.
[193:41.01]I guess that makes sense.
[193:51.58]Okay.
[193:52.88]Let's do the other one.
[193:53.88]He missed another van.
[193:55.36]I'm done with the van mission.
[194:01.59]Cigarettes equal energy drinks equal cartoons.
[194:06.49]Look up.
[194:07.77]I'm just quoting from an article.
[194:16.28]Alright, I'm gonna convince more people.
[194:27.07]Hi.
[194:29.19]Convince... the... who?
[194:33.67]Drop the human disguise.
[194:34.81]Wait.
[194:35.55]These people actually want to talk to me?
[194:43.00]How'd you get in?
[194:43.84]I told you, one time I drank an energy drink and I couldn't go to sleep for two days.
[194:51.83]I was lying in bed.
[195:06.76]After rolling around for like four hours, just like being like, this is fucking hell.
[195:13.24]What?
[195:13.66]Oh, I can't fucking sleep.
[195:15.59]It was horrible.
[195:17.77]I literally got maybe 14 minutes of sleep and woke up and my eyes were all red.
[195:21.71]And I stayed for the whole rest of the next day.
[195:26.21]And I couldn't go to bed.
[195:27.17]And I started drinking a bunch of water to try to like flush my system of like the energy drink.
[195:35.72]It took until the next, that evening, like a full like 32 plus hours.
[195:40.34]I finally was able to go to bed.
[195:41.50]That means it worked.
[195:50.54]That wasn't an energy drink.
[195:53.32]Yes, it was.
[196:04.49]It was one of those big ass red bulls.
[196:08.25]It was one of the red bulls that are way too big.
[196:10.63]That are big in your hand.
[196:12.85]The huge ones.
[196:16.21]Why did I get the huge one?
[196:23.00]I don't know because I was bored.
[196:29.74]And I drank it over the course of a while.
[196:32.60]It wasn't like I slammed the whole thing in ten minutes.
[196:34.31]I needed to stay... keep myself energized.
[196:42.61]No, I drank it over like two hours!
[196:44.35]Come here, freak.
[196:59.16]you ran the risk I think I have to be a hippie right yo freak who are you man I'm looking for shamalama that's nice man smooth why did I want to be energized before sleep no this was I I drank it like from 8 a.m to like 10 a.m it was in the morning
[197:32.97]I've got to be like a hippie.
[197:36.83]Why?
[197:38.25]Because.
[197:38.53]I was at a convention, okay?
[197:43.65]And I needed to stay up because I was really tired and I was at a convention.
[197:47.29]This was like in 2013.
[197:57.30]No, it was like PAX.
[197:58.52]It was like PAX Prime in Seattle or something one year.
[198:09.87]Say the word convention, and that's it.
[198:11.59]It's all it takes.
[198:13.33]I'm looking for Shama Lama.
[198:16.21]Can you help me out?
[198:19.83]Am I going to be at TwitchCon?
[198:25.33]No, I'm not.
[198:28.39]TwitchCon is not on the cards.
[198:31.97]The move to Vegas is going to be too much for me to handle going into another trip right after that.
[198:40.44]That's going to happen not even a month later.
[198:44.46]It would take some kind of other extenuating circumstance for me to go to TwitchCon.
[198:52.19]Stop the police convoy.
[198:53.03]Okay.
[199:08.85]The police convoy is at the Coit Tunnel.
[199:10.71]Hurry.
[199:13.61]Where the heck is that?
[199:20.12]Where's my map?

[201:00.84]Tunnel?
[201:01.22]It's right there.
[201:01.96]Oh!
[201:18.69]I thought it was destroy the convoy.
[201:20.25]Bop. Bop. Bop. Bop. Bop. Bop. Bop.
[201:37.13]Scanning.
[201:38.43]Info.
[201:43.44]He's still in the city?
[201:45.41]He's still here?
[201:46.83]What's he still doing in Anor Lando?
[201:48.87]What's he doing here?
[201:51.43]What's he doing here?
[201:52.57]Why is he still here?
[201:53.87]What's he still doing in Anor Lando?
[202:01.84]Can you believe it?
[202:17.14]That reminds me of one of my favorite videos on YouTube.
[202:22.90]The Randy Savage breathing compilation.
[202:27.70]It's one of the best videos I've ever seen.
[202:30.85]They're like I've never seen a video that made me laugh that hard.
[202:38.80]it's gonna take me to the boiling point we need to watch it right now it's the it's like the best video alright here here if you want to watch watch you can watch like one of the best videos on the on the whole website
[203:17.45]You know, I think that's part of a larger compilation.
[203:28.52]Somebody made a video where it's like seven or eight minutes of different wrestlers doing that.
[203:40.27]Just every break in breath when they breathe in heavy to say something else.
[203:48.27]Our version.
[203:51.87]That would be unbearable.
[203:53.29]I'm going the wrong way.
[203:55.45]Wrong way.
[203:59.48]You didn't show it?
[204:00.36]Well, that's a whole ordeal.
[204:02.50]I linked it into the stream.
[204:03.48]Alright, where you at?
[204:08.30]There they are.
[204:10.52]Found them.
[204:11.00]Now I just have to force the cops to let him out of the car.
[204:17.99]Look, an alien!
[204:25.35]Okay, if I do that he'll jump out.
[204:31.01]There he is.
[204:32.93]Get him to the safe zone.
[204:40.28]I can't pick him up?
[204:47.86]Oh, fuck.
[205:00.08]Hold on.
[205:19.32]Play Jackbox?
[205:21.04]No, not today.
[205:21.86]I'm having fun with this game.
[205:22.74]This game's good.
[205:26.54]I'm just... I'm having a blast playing Destroy Humanity.
[205:31.70]Plug this in.
[205:32.36]Hold on.
[205:37.42]Did it work?
[205:41.64]Yes, it did.
[205:46.26]So, how am I supposed to...
[205:53.26]I think I have to make them follow me.
[205:55.94]I need to land.
[206:01.04]Don't fucking explode this person.
[206:05.33]They're gonna get shot.
[206:06.11]Alright, just make them follow you.
[206:23.74]Be good.
[206:24.98]Be good.
[206:26.72]This is a mission right here.
[206:30.92]Wait, where the hell am I going?
[206:33.92]I saw the X and it made me turn the other direction because I'm a brain-infused dumb person.
[206:46.15]Get inside.
[206:50.23]Do it quick!
[206:51.81]Ah, fuck you!
[206:53.11]Got it.
[207:01.93]Okay.
[207:05.31]All clear.
[207:11.25]To the safe zone.
[207:13.35]Come with me.
[207:17.05]Let me scan.
[207:19.62]Follow me.
[207:20.42]Let's go.
[207:20.86]I will take you there.
[207:23.80]And I will get a complete mission.
[207:25.70]And it'll be fun.
[207:26.52]This thing doesn't know it's me, right?
[207:37.57]Absolutely no... Why did that guy just shoot?
[207:39.99]Why are they shooting the tank at those people?
[207:44.57]What the hell was that?
[207:47.31]It's...
[207:50.62]I'll look into it.
[207:53.30]Yeah, I will.
[207:57.16]I'm gonna lose it.
[208:05.05]Lady.
[208:06.07]Oh, come on.
[208:11.43]You... You idiot.
[208:14.61]You idiot!
[208:15.91]You idiot!
[208:17.22]You idiot!
[208:29.67]Don't throw a grenade over here, what are you doing?
[208:44.09]No.
[208:47.69]No, I don't want to start over.
[208:50.18]This time, I'm not going to get on the ship anymore.
[208:56.93]He didn't even throw the grenade at me.
[208:58.41]He threw it at that guy.
[209:01.48]He was trying to kill that guy.
[209:03.10]And why didn't he not get out of the way?
[209:05.56]Fuck me.
[209:13.30]Will he talk to me like this?
[209:16.55]Ehhh.
[209:24.76]Clean snatch.
[209:27.02]Come here.
[209:28.74]And let me yabba dabba doo.
[209:32.92]Let's go.
[209:41.64]This time, I'm just going to go to the police convoy.
[209:44.32]Because it's... I'm just going to walk this road.
[209:47.31]I'm not getting in the ship.
[209:55.89]This way, to the left, they come down this road.
[209:59.01]Okay, I'm not a moron, right?
[210:06.07]I'm not stupid.
[210:06.83]It's right here.
[210:10.46]Convince them to get out of the car.
[210:13.40]They just make them dance.
[210:14.56]That's the easiest way to do it.
[210:18.46]They all get out.
[210:19.42]No, just one guy is going to get out.
[210:35.23]Okay, I thought he was dead.
[210:36.60]I thought he died.
[210:39.58]No.
[210:44.98]No, stop it, please.
[210:47.22]Stop it.
[210:48.60]Stop it.
[210:49.14]I need to just... Just don't throw any grenades and move.
[210:55.65]Okay, all clear.
[210:57.09]Get over here, you fucking idiot.
[210:58.91]Follow me.
[211:00.07]Follow.
[211:03.89]Follow!
[211:05.67]I want this disguise instead.
[211:06.61]This disguise gives full health.
[211:07.77]Is he following me?
[211:09.19]Yes, yes.
[211:09.81]Alright, let's... All clear.
[211:13.35]Let's move.
[211:13.81]Come with me.
[211:31.39]Get off the road.
[211:32.11]Get on the sidewalk.
[211:34.05]Sidewalk.
[211:35.55]Thank you.
[211:38.63]It's gonna get run over by a car.
[211:46.55]What the fuck?
[211:51.32]Alright, well, the heat's off me now.
[211:55.02]I ain't paid enough for this crap.
[212:05.23]Where'd he go?
[212:06.89]Okay, come on.
[212:11.16]Get over here.
[212:12.50]Why is this guy also injured?
[212:16.86]Alright, sprint.
[212:19.14]I'm just going to get there.
[212:19.84]Alright, this guy's finally got full health.
[212:31.79]Come with me.
[212:39.43]they've seen you follow me
[213:25.39]Hurry up!
[213:25.85]Run faster!
[213:31.89]Who's he shooting at?
[213:32.43]One of the clowns?
[213:33.51]He hit me right in the fucking head.
[213:34.79]He wouldn't even aim it at me.
[213:42.09]Oh my god.
[213:44.69]That's not even the guy that saw me.
[213:56.76]Come on!
[213:57.60]We're finally there, Jesus.
[214:05.80]Don't get hit by a car.
[214:13.62]No car, no car, no car, no car, no car, no car!
[214:16.83]Thank God.
[214:19.61]Uh, we gotta go in here.
[214:25.21]Inside.
[214:29.43]Got him.
[214:34.30]This way.
[214:34.68]Come on.
[214:36.82]This way.
[214:37.48]Around the bush.
[214:42.24]Come on.
[214:43.16]Get over here.
[214:45.14]Go.
[214:47.74]Into the circle.
[214:50.60]I promise.
[214:52.24]You will be taken care of.
[214:53.22]First try.
[214:57.96]Got it.
[215:03.05]You saved my life.
[215:05.01]Have you heard the good pickup line of Ark Voodle?
[215:08.39]Heard it.
[215:09.71]I am it.
[215:13.68]You owe me, hippie.
[215:15.18]You owe me money.
[215:16.40]Yes, thank you for freeing me.
[215:18.44]I would never have survived in there.
[215:20.02]Did you see the cells?
[215:21.10]Filthy.
[215:22.24]Yeah, yeah, that's great, Chama.
[215:24.82]But I was thinking...
[215:29.26]Manage it for me.
[215:30.64]So I guess what I'm doing here is I'm causing the cult fights the police for me.
[215:36.84]The more of these missions I do, the more presence I have of essentially companions around the city.
[215:41.84]I see we're in 3D glasses.
[215:57.87]I'll take my gratitude in material goods, thanks.
[216:02.07]Something shiny would be nice.
[216:04.79]Well, I have been hunting an alien artifact for ages.
[216:08.39]Ooh, where is it?
[216:09.83]It hasn't come up in conversation until now.
[216:12.39]It's a super weapon where it summons a fearsome demon from the bowels of the Earth.
[216:18.83]So he can see the world in 3D, man.
[216:20.12]Imagine the sun was that annoying.
[216:21.96]You can read it.
[216:24.46]Alright.
[216:50.97]There's a lot of those side missions.
[216:52.99]First let's kill.
[217:10.64]Okay, this is taking longer than I thought.
[217:17.88]Holy shit, who has a shotgun?
[217:19.95]Does this guy have a flute gun?
[217:24.87]I'm going to go to the actual mission over here.
[217:26.65]I thought he was going to walk into the ocean.
[217:37.94]I need my ship.
[217:40.56]Where's the closest ship thing?
[217:44.24]Straight ahead.
[217:54.37]Little green men.
[217:55.77]Little green men.
[217:58.07]They're everywhere.
[218:04.72]Let's do the actual story mission.
[218:07.78]I feel like we haven't done one of those in a while.
[218:10.86]Come on.
[218:13.48]Let's go.
[218:16.45]Hurry up.
[218:21.72]I do have 19.
[218:22.22]Let's see.
[218:23.36]These are all locked.
[218:26.94]Jetpack is 36.
[218:28.03]I don't really use this weapon, though.
[218:33.29]It's kind of cool.
[218:34.07]Maybe I should do zap.
[218:36.43]Chain lighting to additional targets.
[218:37.77]Yeah.
[218:38.83]No.
[218:39.29]Here we go.
[218:42.19]Crypto shield strength and the saucer.
[218:44.02]Let's do saucer shield strength. 16.
[218:52.97]Anything lower than 7.
[218:53.95]I need 6.
[218:56.95]10.
[218:57.25]These are both purchased.
[219:05.18]16, 4, 8.
[219:06.58]And that's all I can do.
[219:11.98]I probably should take a look at the gene splicer as well.
[219:17.68]Let's see.
[219:18.13]Can I do anything else here?
[219:20.94]Uh, GI switcheroo, base city soldiers.
[219:23.16]Okay.
[219:28.16]Kremlin hoodwink.
[219:29.85]Crypto is back.
[219:30.71]Alright, that's all I can do.
[219:31.57]I can get... snatch the army men at twice the rate here.
[219:38.73]That's good.
[219:40.09]Let's go to the yellow circle.
[219:47.12]Can I, like, dunk in the water?
[219:48.30]Or does that instantly kill you?
[219:49.24]No, you can't even go that low.
[219:53.38]Although there is one of the... Let me try it.
[219:54.68]I'll do this.
[219:55.64]Can I land anywhere over here?
[219:57.10]No.
[219:57.98]It's a landing zone I can't do.
[219:59.22]How would I get over here?
[220:00.10]You know what I'm saying?
[220:03.93]How the fuck am I supposed to get over that?
[220:07.91]That's the last jetpack upgrade and jump from there and fly?
[220:10.69]Okay.
[220:20.17]You unlock the landing zone with that statue?
[220:21.61]Yeah, I'm just saying, how do you get over there in the first place?
[220:23.11]Do you just have to fly the jetpack over there?
[220:27.80]It's a full moon.
[220:33.24]Are you talking about in real life, or are you talking about in the game?
[220:37.37]In reality?
[220:39.29]Alright, right here.
[220:45.25]That guy's got a rocket launcher.
[220:47.66]Do it.
[220:52.66]Shoot me.
[220:53.14]Do it, then.
[220:55.10]Do it!
[220:55.78]Shoot it!
[220:56.97]He got fucking run over.
[220:58.01]What an idiot.
[220:58.61]Whatever.
[220:59.13]You guys are useless.
[221:21.48]We've got those KGB agents now, Crypto!
[221:24.80]Does he remember or not?
[221:25.84]Finally!
[221:26.64]My gun was getting lonely!
[221:28.40]He's not gonna start shooting at me, is he?
[221:31.26]And I didn't think it was possible for anyone to wear worse suits than Majestic.
[221:35.54]Hey, let's talk.
[221:36.12]Know what you got on those sneaky monkeys?
[221:42.75]Bongwater's last transmission betrayed the location of the KGB.
[221:46.79]That's so funny that they just stand here.
[221:53.09]Well, hey, that's the thing I just was talking about.
[221:55.87]That's where we have to go.
[221:57.07]Tinycam is back?
[221:58.15]No, it's not.
[222:52.90]It's my scream now!
[222:58.45]God dammit.
[223:06.97]I- Oh, I know.
[223:08.33]This is- I gotta go now.
[223:09.63]Like, I'll be back in a minute.
[223:16.46]I can't touch this controller.
[223:17.74]This is bad.
[223:22.97]I actually have to go wash my hands.
[223:24.09]I'll be back in a minute.
[223:25.23]I can't even touch the mouse either.
[223:33.01]Bye.
[223:33.15]I'll be back.
[223:35.73]See you later.
[223:39.64]See you in a minute.
[226:13.98]What?
[226:17.78]What did I do?
[226:18.75]What's not legal?
[226:21.89]What are you talking about?
[226:30.15]What happened?
[226:30.68]I don't understand what you're doing.
[226:34.86]Oh, you're being funny.
[226:42.05]I understand.
[226:42.33]Yeah, I know my mic was on.
[226:47.06]I didn't do anything.
[226:48.14]I literally went upstairs and like coughed.
[227:02.61]I coughed once.
[227:06.87]And I got myself a delicious drink.
[227:10.79]Mm-hmm.
[227:14.27]A good drink.
[227:17.79]What?
[227:18.13]Oh, right, this guy is still here.
[227:22.15]That, like, was really, really fucked up.
[227:30.71]I, like, feel bad about that one.
[227:31.83]He's just, like, gone.
[227:34.43]All the life gone.
[227:35.57]Immediately.
[227:38.29]I feel terrible right now.
[227:42.74]That actually made me feel really bad.
[227:53.57]Hey, look at him.
[227:54.19]I'm dancing.
[227:54.83]Look at me.
[227:55.17]Look at my arms and legs move around.
[227:57.97]Funny, huh?
[227:59.55]Fuck the dead.
[228:08.35]Eat this, dead guy!
[228:12.97]Protect?
[228:13.47]What does that mean?
[228:17.43]Oh, he's gonna fight for me.
[228:18.39]I get it.
[228:23.68]Bad egg.
[228:31.68]Oh, wait.
[228:33.34]He doesn't dance too?
[228:34.26]He just takes easy shots?
[228:37.77]Oh, that's a terrible way to go.
[228:39.01]Is he just gonna do this to everybody?
[228:42.37]You're obstructing my justice.
[229:03.97]Alright, let's go to the... The rock.
[229:07.63]Somehow.
[229:07.93]See if I can get over there for a bit.
[229:12.51]Fuck the dead.
[229:15.19]No, not that... Again, this is like... This is the stream where... Everything has to be... Like a sexual comment.
[229:23.89]No.
[229:24.55]I was talking about like, fuck that guy.
[229:28.53]Fuck it, because he's like... Fuck him.
[229:30.04]Fuck him.
[229:34.35]Like, you know, for instance, like, fuck this guy, right?
[229:39.48]I'm gonna say, I could probably get that from the duck.
[229:46.46]Whoops.
[229:47.06]Alright, let's do a toon dip.
[229:58.38]What do you say?
[230:00.30]Remember in Who Framed Roger Rabbit when the shoe goes in?
[230:09.63]Why did he explode?
[230:17.43]Okay, well, he drowned so bad that he blew up.
[230:27.82]He's a robot.
[230:31.32]Anyway, make a prank call.
[230:38.46]I need to make a quick frag.
[230:41.17]Is the refrigerator running?
[230:42.59]Let's try it again.
[230:45.23]Hey, wait, I gotta call.
[230:47.13]I gotta make the phone call.
[230:51.77]Yeah, I wanna put down 50 large on the Niners.
[231:11.85]Anybody else want to make a call to the office?
[231:14.18]Wait, I got a funny one.
[231:16.74]I'm just waiting to hear this, guys.
[231:18.56]Police headquarters, Officer Johnson.
[231:24.93]Officer Johnson's been called a lot recently.
[231:27.19]I can put in a word with the judge.
[231:32.93]Police headquarters, Officer Johnson.
[231:35.88]Hey, why the long face?
[231:39.02]Why?
[231:44.00]Is that it?
[231:50.20]What a terrible prank call.
[231:51.54]That sucked.
[231:53.74]No, we can't end on that one.
[231:57.39]Yeah, we're ending on that one.
[231:58.41]Fuck it.
[231:58.71]We're done.
[232:05.47]I love this game.
[232:06.85]What a fucking great game.
[232:12.74]Watch out!
[232:14.20]Watch out!
[232:17.74]It's going to push you off.
[232:18.64]Oh my god.
[232:21.30]Hold on, wait a minute.

[232:50.58]Don't let me shoot you.
[233:11.36]Alright, he can't hit me from here.
[233:12.76]I can transmog this.
[233:15.39]No, I can't.
[233:16.25]Alright, well, I'm just... I guess we just have to get across this.

[234:39.04]Silence!
[234:40.32]The workers' revolution is inevitable.
[234:42.92]Right.
[234:44.48]You don't really know much about capitalism, do you, Ivan?
[234:49.18]It's not alcoholic.
[234:49.97]It's... I know corrupt corporations.
[234:51.57]Something better than that.
[234:52.65]...off the toil of the American worker, even as they pull the strings of the American government.
[234:58.39]Exactly.
[234:59.47]You can't beat that kind of muscle.
[235:04.00]Alright, for one second I thought that guy behind us was just a standard enemy that's not supposed to be in the cutscene.
[235:11.37]I was about to laugh my ass off.
[235:18.09]Oh, it was quiet.

[236:51.56]I did not... That doesn't... No, I did not die at the end of a mission.
[236:55.92]I failed the mission.
[236:57.28]Somebody else died.
[236:58.96]I didn't.
[237:10.25]Use the saucer?
[237:10.96]I can't.
[237:11.72]I have to fly over there.

[252:22.84]Ruin lives.
[252:24.98]Ruin the draft dodger.
[252:27.02]Oh, hold on.

[252:32.69]No.
[252:33.45]Return the AWOL hippie to the army depot.
[252:37.56]Okay.
[252:39.66]I guess.
[252:43.47]Scan humans to find out where the AWOL hippie is.
[252:47.81]Maybe these guys will know.
[252:48.71]Shit.
[252:48.83]Oh, shit.
[252:49.17]That scream.
[252:49.51]That Marv scream.
[252:49.95]Oh.

[253:48.68]There's also one of those faces there.
[254:12.04]Sprint over there.
[254:12.92]I'm not taking the ship.
[254:16.96]A misspelled complex?
[254:19.86]How?
[254:24.28]I mean, I wasn't paying any attention at all, but how?
[254:35.02]Can I end this prematurely?
[254:38.58]Do you deliver?
[254:48.81]So what does it what does that even do if you prank call something the police it doesn't stop them from coming to where you are It just it just trolls them that's all it does alright, that's it oh

[255:12.13]Come on, you've ruined everything, car.
[255:21.05]Come on, I had to show the new viewers that you can pick up cars and throw them.
[255:23.83]That's all it was.
[255:24.71]You guys have seen this a lot, but the new viewers that just came in didn't see that before.
[255:28.80]I wanted everyone to be like, what the fuck?
[255:30.54]I'm new!
[255:37.69]Alright, out, out, out, out, out.
[255:39.83]He's right.
[255:40.23]I just tuned it.
[255:40.91]See?
[255:51.80]Get in his head.
[255:54.60]Forget what you saw.
[255:55.30]I'm not going to make everybody dance.
[255:56.14]It's not worth it.
[255:56.98]What did he say about eggs?
[256:03.87]We're not clear yet, but I don't care.
[256:08.30]I've never seen that before.
[256:09.50]See?

[256:26.13]Let's get another demon door.
[256:37.05]That's kind of fucked up.
[256:41.77]Make him follow?
[256:43.05]Sounds like a plan.
[256:48.61]Alright, anybody I guess.
[256:49.43]I don't think it matters who it is.
[256:50.77]So it'll be you.
[256:56.07]How many do you want?
[256:58.55]Is one enough?
[257:01.97]That was very quick, and it was very easy.
[257:05.65]Just get them all to come over here.
[257:09.23]What the hell is that, huh?
[257:16.13]Shit, I'm gonna lose the disguise.
[257:17.17]How?
[257:29.09]Do they have to come over here willingly, or can they just walk over here?
[257:32.60]I guess that one's already done.
[257:34.96]Alright, we're done.
[257:39.90]Alright, there it is.
[257:46.25]Call it.
[257:46.59]I only have 20 yet.
[257:53.27]I need to get more, uh... So what we're doing, we're gonna go to... We have to go up to the tower.

[258:16.28]So, if you pick up enough of these, you get... That's how... You gotta get a lot.
[258:22.68]That does seem like a lot.
[258:26.70]Get, like, 50 of them?
[258:28.45]30 of them?
[258:33.08]Do a joke or a riot?
[258:36.03]Wait, I don't know.
[258:36.73]I'm not just gonna do a joke.
[258:37.79]I gotta take this guy.
[258:43.45]Joke or bad?
[258:44.19]No.
[258:44.79]Will you guys relax?
[258:46.27]Okay, where is this guy?
[258:48.79]I'll just scan some more people.
[258:53.88]Prank call or unfollow?
[258:54.58]No, I'm not gonna prank call somebody.
[259:03.21]Where do you guys think you are right now?
[259:06.61]You guys are fucking out of your mind.
[259:09.31]Is he inside?
[259:15.31]Oh, north of the tower.
[259:16.34]Okay.
[259:16.58]So he's this way.
[259:34.10]I believe that's probably the house he's in.
[259:44.12]No.
[259:51.85]Maybe over here.
[259:54.23]Yes, there he is.
[259:57.37]They've seen... Pooh zombie.
[260:01.73]Are the police not allowed over here?
[260:07.60]Alright, get Clayton back to the army depot.
[260:16.25]Hey!
[260:17.01]Whoa!
[260:18.33]What is he doing?
[260:20.43]He's just sitting down.
[260:21.95]Okay, um... Forget, forget, forget, forget.
[260:30.56]Okay, we got him.
[260:32.06]They're really stupid.
[260:33.46]Come with me.
[260:34.62]Your wish is my command.
[260:36.88]Back to the Army Depot.
[260:40.16]So now we gotta go back here.
[260:44.54]Do not... Are they shooting at me or who or them or where?
[260:48.92]I don't know.
[260:51.10]Are they following me?
[260:54.20]They're all following me.
[260:55.00]They're not gonna shoot me, are they?
[260:56.94]No, it's just like a war here in the streets.
[261:00.73]Alright, let's go.
[261:03.87]And we're going the wrong way.
[261:04.87]I had the map turned around.
[261:08.62]Oh, they're all his bodyguards.
[261:09.60]Well, why are they not bodyguarding?
[261:11.36]They're currently just getting shot.
[261:17.04]Are we going to survive this?
[261:19.14]Are you going to survive?
[261:19.72]Especially you.
[261:23.27]Yes, we're good.
[261:28.09]Almost there.
[261:28.67]They've seen you.
[261:30.35]I need a new disguise.
[261:42.68]One of the bodyguards.
[261:43.34]I don't care who it is.
[261:44.08]Not this guy.
[261:46.29]This one.
[261:52.77]Shoot it.
[261:56.34]Shoot it.
[261:56.62]Shoot it.
[261:56.90]Shoot it.
[261:57.78]No, that was a lady.
[261:58.58]That was a random lady.
[262:04.22]Come on.
[262:04.46]Let's go.
[262:05.47]Come on.
[262:10.02]Come here.
[262:10.66]Follow me.
[262:11.24]Get off the ground.
[262:11.92]Go, go, go, go, go.
[262:13.42]Forget all these idiots.
[262:14.26]Just run by them.
[262:14.82]Who cares?
[262:18.28]I thought that guy was just executing that lady.
[262:22.90]Very clearly.
[262:23.64]He had a gun to her head.
[262:34.55]Slow.
[262:35.33]No, not slow.
[262:35.89]Speed it up.
[262:37.65]These guys are going to see me?
[262:40.33]At least three KGB agents versus a police officer.
[262:43.03]Yes, it is.
[262:43.65]It's madness.
[262:44.45]Just keep going.
[262:45.35]We're almost there.
[262:47.55]Don't do it.
[262:55.01]It has a machine gun on it.
[263:04.09]Halloween!
[263:06.99]Forget what you saw!
[263:09.20]It's me, your friend.
[263:10.60]Remember me?
[263:15.81]God bless America.
[263:17.79]That's true.
[263:22.99]That was just... What was his name?
[263:24.39]Taffy?
[263:27.45]Whoa, whoa!
[263:29.21]What's going on?
[263:40.22]Just get over here.
[263:40.80]Come on, come on, come on.
[263:41.54]Onto the bridge.
[263:43.00]Onto the bridge.
[263:44.04]No, right here.
[263:46.67]Oh, no, that's the guy I need to talk him to.
[263:50.61]How do I shoot?
[263:52.23]Get... What do you mean, how do you shoot?
[263:58.51]What do you mean, how do you shoot?
[263:59.73]Come on, over here.
[264:11.13]Come over in here.
[264:14.17]Jesus Christ.
[264:17.95]Clayton Cartwell Jr.
[264:18.81]caught sent to war zone.
[264:19.81]Alright, we only got one more thing to do in this city.
[264:30.16]No, we don't.
[264:30.68]Fuck, there's a lot to do in these places.
[264:36.17]Another one.
[264:38.69]Oh, we got this again on the wharf.
[264:40.17]This is probably a part two.
[264:41.11]Let's check it out.
[264:47.37]This is not a funny stream.
[264:50.42]No, it's not supposed to be.
[264:52.96]It's not supposed to be funny.
[264:53.98]It's supposed to be... It's supposed to be educational.
[264:57.60]It's supposed to be edutainment.
[264:59.32]What is it, soldier?
[265:01.64]You weren't here earlier when we talked about beets and radishes and shit.
[265:06.24]What's happening?
[265:07.93]Zip it, soldier.
[265:08.67]We got problems.
[265:10.17]Private Danza's been caught selling bazookas to the Soviets.
[265:13.45]It's not educational.
[265:14.03]Also, he may have some problems.
[265:16.05]I was young and needed the money.
[265:17.80]No, I'm playing Destroy All Humans 2.
[265:20.48]It's fun.
[265:23.00]You want me to kill one of your own guys?
[265:27.06]He's at security risk.
[265:30.06]You got a problem with that, soldier?
[265:35.91]Spider's baby face came in bingo.
[265:41.31]Well, that was earlier.
[265:44.52]Crypto hired gun, Private Danza.
[265:49.04]Okay.
[265:50.26]Kill Private Danza.
[265:51.16]That's it.
[265:52.32]There are a lot of people here.
[265:54.80]Are they all chasing him?
[265:58.22]You got him.
[265:59.26]I don't even need to do anything.
[266:00.06]You killed him already.
[266:01.22]Congratulations.
[266:04.58]I don't understand the fight here.
[266:05.99]Who are these people?
[266:10.89]What's the boy?
[266:11.63]He's got a... Okay, now he's getting really close with that bazooka.
[266:20.14]Is there any more bazookas?
[266:22.02]No, there is not.
[266:24.22]These two guys... What are you?
[266:25.48]There's a fucking 300 Spartans.
[266:37.74]Well, you did that to yourself, man.
[266:49.59]I wanted to shoot.
[266:50.27]I don't think he's going to though.
[266:53.26]Shoot it!
[266:54.22]Just do it!
[266:56.78]Do it!
[266:58.98]Shoot it!
[267:00.42]Why are you so dumb?
[267:02.96]Look, I'm going to grab your friend and it's going to really piss you off.
[267:05.84]Wait, but hold on.
[267:06.30]Here comes the other soldiers.
[267:08.46]Look, I'm going to give you a target.
[267:14.72]No.
[267:15.42]Alright, this guy died a long time ago.
[267:19.84]What about the guy with the bazooka?
[267:20.94]Hey, your friend.
[267:21.82]Jesus, man.
[267:22.87]Your friend over here.
[267:23.97]This guy doesn't even care about his friend.
[267:28.39]Oh, he's so fucked.
[267:32.61]Okay, I gotta get out of here.
[267:36.31]You're not gonna do that here, are you?
[267:39.00]Come on, somebody throw a grenade.
[267:39.96]Do it.
[267:43.34]Somebody throw a grenade.
[267:45.02]I know one of you will.
[267:47.44]I've played this game before.
[267:51.34]He's gonna step too far into the water.
[267:52.73]Do it.
[267:57.07]One more step back.
[268:01.81]Somebody throw a grenade!
[268:03.03]It's not that hard.
[268:05.73]I know one of you has at least one.
[268:07.27]Alright, well they're not gonna do it, so we're gonna have to move on.
[268:28.68]Let's go.
[268:28.92]Wait, what does it do?
[268:30.36]I have to kill private.
[268:31.22]I'm going to kill a private guy over here.
[268:36.87]Stay away from that thing.
[268:38.85]Oh, no way.
[268:40.63]Give me this.
[268:41.09]What the hell is that?
[268:47.09]It's a mine.
[268:48.15]Okay, I thought it was a bug.
[268:54.07]That's not an invisible...
[268:57.06]There's an invisible wall here.
[268:58.08]Alright, well there he is.
[268:58.82]Alright, we're gonna have to go with... I don't have any more.
[269:03.54]I didn't have to do anything.
[269:06.48]Alright, that's fine.
[269:10.14]Just blow up your own stuff, bud.
[269:11.56]Shoot me.
[269:14.04]Shoot it.
[269:14.34]Alright, I just have to kill him, right?
[269:16.85]That's it?
[269:17.21]Did I just put him in the tree?
[269:23.09]Is he alive?
[269:27.24]How is he alive?
[269:28.03]You're still alive?
[269:29.99]No fucking way, man.
[269:34.77]Get into the water and die.
[269:37.41]Okay.
[269:42.86]Investigation death of private Danza.
[269:44.52]Recommended action blame all smuggling blowback on Danza.
[269:49.86]Okay.
[269:57.69]Why am I not taking damage?
[270:04.00]What's going on right now?
[270:08.18]I didn't do any cheat codes or anything.
[270:10.20]How did I do this?
[270:14.93]Did I like press a combination of buttons accidentally to turn on god mode?
[270:22.83]I think I may have done an accidental cheat code.
[270:30.81]You've seen me the whole game.
[270:32.19]I haven't done anything that you wouldn't have known.
[270:34.19]You could have seen me do it.
[270:38.85]Hold on.
[270:42.27]Destroy all humans too.
[270:44.57]Cheats.
[270:53.84]Pause the game and select
[270:58.17]No, I didn't do this.
[270:59.57]Pause the game and select Archives, hold L3 and press X, square, triangle, circle, square, circle, triangle, X, X. That would be pretty insane.
[271:10.01]If that actually, no, there's no way.
[271:14.40]Hold on.
[271:21.58]Huh?
[271:28.52]I want to have an X right.
[271:42.73]Oh, what the hell?
[271:46.01]I just downloaded a movie.
[271:50.65]That's not the right code.
[271:53.84]This isn't like a hot coffee porn mod or something, right?
[271:57.35]Why is my chat dead?
[271:59.33]What happened?
[271:59.79]Am I still streaming?
[272:21.18]I'm going to reload chat.
[272:22.52]It's an actual director commentary.
[272:24.96]I don't want to watch this.
[272:26.66]No, I'm... Okay, so let me turn off invincibility then.
[272:51.94]Okay, hold L3 at the pause menu.
[273:00.24]Hold on.
[273:02.32]Okay, L3, R1, L1, X, right.
[273:13.09]It's not doing anything.
[273:16.59]Can I help you?
[273:27.73]Okay.
[273:32.48]Can I die now?
[273:41.14]I need to take some damage here to see what's going on.
[273:44.43]I was not on god mode the whole stream.
[273:50.53]What is going on?
[273:51.33]Why am I invincible?
[273:58.00]This is not... I don't understand.
[274:02.79]I didn't do anything.
[274:03.71]I need to see a different... I need to turn it on and turn it off.
[274:17.70]Okay.
[274:18.50]No, I don't want that gun invincible.
[274:25.27]Wait a minute.
[274:28.11]guys invincible crypto this is kind of a glitch but it's easy you need two people to do this first one of you body snatch a cop or a military personnel then the one who has the cop goes and calls the all clear but before he finishes like while he is still talking the other player smashes a car on him sometimes you get stuck in the human body or the car you're smashing and it will go through him
[274:59.27]That's not what I did.
[274:59.89]And why were there likes in there?
[275:03.35]That didn't work.
[275:04.05]Hold on.
[275:07.03]Cheat codes.
[275:09.63]This wasn't... I was dying before.
[275:13.22]Was it when I did the prank call shit?
[275:19.58]What am I... I just read that word for word.
[275:23.60]God damn it.
[275:24.22]Destroy all humans.
[275:28.32]Invincibility.
[275:31.60]I can die in the water.
[275:32.64]Can anybody remember when the last time I took damage was?
[275:49.47]I don't remember.
[275:50.01]I definitely did.
[275:52.03]I definitely did.
[276:07.07]It was the cop body got killed while you were using the police phone.
[276:09.81]That's exactly what the glitch is.
[276:12.23]How do I go back?
[276:21.24]Glitches.
[276:24.34]GameShark codes.
[276:25.74]No, I need to get this off.
[276:29.16]I'm going to restart.
[276:29.66]I'm going to save.
[276:30.34]Okay, hold on.
[276:33.75]Was it a boat?
[276:34.45]No.
[276:34.71]Okay, save.
[276:43.68]Fuck.
[276:45.42]Okay.
[276:46.82]Save game.
[276:48.50]Alright, when was that last save?
[276:49.46]That's 2225.
[276:49.68]What time is it right now?
[276:50.44]2228, 2225.
[276:50.48]Same day?
[276:50.68]I'm gonna load this one.
[276:56.34]This was like three minutes ago.
[277:04.46]It's 2228 right now.
[277:05.68]222530.
[277:05.70]Let's load that one.
[277:14.31]That has to work, right?
[277:16.21]Has to.
[277:16.51]Let's try that.
[277:28.05]Alright, that leaves me with... I have this one mission here.
[277:37.15]Let's see if I can get killed.
[277:42.51]Hit me with a car.
[277:45.56]Okay, we're fixed.
[277:46.40]I actually... I accidentally did the invincibility bug.
[277:55.56]At some point... I don't know what that was.
[277:59.87]Okay.
[278:01.33]Whoever's watching the VOD right now, go back and see exactly how that happened.
[278:04.67]Because I don't know.
[278:10.22]Alright, so let me... Let's go do this last one here.
[278:14.58]And then... I'll probably wrap up the stream here after this.
[278:19.31]Very likely at the prank call.
[278:21.03]Yeah.
[278:24.53]Okay, I'm taking damage from bullets.
[278:29.96]This is not a VOD, silly.
[278:31.16]Well, not now, but it will be.
[278:33.42]It will be very soon.
[278:39.61]This game's awesome.
[278:42.51]I very much appreciate this video game.
[278:44.53]And I should have just flown the saucer.
[278:54.82]This one's way better than the first one.
[278:58.46]The first one felt... I mean, obviously, it was a long time ago.
[279:02.86]But the first one felt a little empty.
[279:04.80]This one feels like an actual, hey, go do open world stuff.
[279:13.65]They nerfed the TK damage.
[279:17.55]Yeah, I like the layout of this game a lot better, though.
[279:20.66]Let's get in.
[279:24.38]No.
[279:25.78]Fly it.
[279:29.24]TK was a lot more fun in 1.
[279:34.49]It's all good.
[279:36.87]We just need to go over here.
[279:41.37]Fast travel, do this last mission, and be completely done with America.
[279:47.59]So I might, um... I kind of want to play this again.
[279:52.21]I think I want to stream this again.
[279:53.57]I wasn't sure if it was going to be one of those scenarios where, oh, maybe I'll just do one and check it out.
[279:57.96]I definitely want to play this again.
[279:59.06]This game's great.
[280:02.66]So... Probably see this again.
[280:10.82]Yeah, I will not be doing the later games.
[280:14.36]For sure.
[280:15.56]The later games are... I heard are very, very bad.
[280:23.22]How are the parties going?
[280:25.62]Finally feeling part of our little cult family.
[280:29.74]The police have been riding our asses.
[280:31.82]Just one cop, Officer Rudolph Malletmeister.
[280:34.95]Officer Rudolph.
[280:35.69]He's harassing the hell out of us.
[280:38.05]What do those pigs have against pacifists anyway?
[280:43.69]Mm-hmm.
[280:43.99]Ask about the super weapon.
[280:45.13]Let's just do it.
[280:45.72]A chance to wail on some cops?
[280:47.88]Count me in, tiger.
[280:50.32]Yeah, the worlds are great.
[280:51.78]Unless the story starts up, it gets pretty engaging.
[280:58.81]They should make a new one.
[281:01.57]This would be a great game to bring back.
[281:03.05]As like a current gen game.
[281:06.06]Alright, let's do it.
[281:15.12]Cult Integrity.
[281:15.95]Defend the hippie tents.
[281:24.21]I'm not sure what hurt him.
[281:26.11]But something did.
[281:27.42]There was a lot of... A tent was destroyed, really?
[281:30.74]What?
[281:33.40]Oh, there it just... Holy shit.
[281:36.38]They're wiping this place out.
[281:37.84]I can't even... I'm gonna hit the accidental hippie.
[281:40.82]Oh, fuck!
[281:41.48]No, no, no, no, no!
[281:43.80]Oh, they're burning!
[281:50.88]Watch out for tents.
[282:01.46]Hope integrity is still fine.
[282:08.12]Get out of here.
[282:08.86]About to run out of bullets.
[282:13.14]Tent is being attacked.
[282:16.02]From where?
[282:21.22]Jesus, there's a lot of people here.
[282:22.68]Intense being attacked.
[282:27.48]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[282:28.66]I'm getting overwhelmed.
[282:32.22]Oh god.
[282:33.08]Uh, you.
[282:36.05]And you.
[282:36.91]What are they doing?
[282:51.74]What's going on?
[282:52.30]Why are they all standing around?
[282:53.18]Oh, really?
[282:53.42]No, just grab him!
[283:19.45]Holy shit.
[283:21.87]Oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god, oh my god.
[283:27.03]Whoa, you can pick up cars?
[283:32.89]I know, right?
[283:35.97]This guy hasn't done anything to help me, by the way.
[283:50.06]What?
[283:50.50]Oh, they're coming from over here.
[283:55.58]They're going to destroy the whole place.
[284:02.76]How much longer is this?
[284:05.72]I think everybody's dead, though.
[284:07.38]Do I still win if everybody dies?
[284:08.72]Disperse or start collecting for bail money.
[284:17.30]He's gonna stay on top of it.
[284:30.28]No, they got in!
[284:32.91]Do it!
[284:43.31]My lord!
[284:54.55]Oh, it's gonna be over here.
[284:55.79]A full minute left.
[285:02.49]Oh my god, man.
[285:04.41]No way.
[285:06.39]Not right now with my current arsenal.
[285:14.10]Oh, it's over.
[285:14.72]Mission failed.
[285:15.64]Alright, I'll get it this time.
[285:24.15]Oh, I can't do it.
[285:29.65]Use the saucer?
[285:32.67]I don't think you can for this mission, can you?
[285:37.40]I gotta get the level dropped here.
[285:47.69]Free love.
[285:48.33]Okay.
[285:49.15]Start this again.
[285:50.55]Alright, I got it.
[285:51.57]Let's do it.
[285:51.98]Come on.
[286:06.31]Why are you already in here?
[286:07.79]No, I can't... No, bad.
[286:09.99]I can't grab this guy.
[286:13.18]There we go.
[286:14.04]Okay, now I gotta be ready.
[286:15.24]Oh, you fucking came seriously.
[286:17.64]He's still alive.
[286:19.06]Pick him up.
[286:19.58]Oh my god.
[286:22.32]Pick him up.
[286:23.18]He's stuck in the ground.
[286:28.66]I can't kill him.
[286:29.74]He's stuck.
[286:34.34]I gotta restart it.
[286:35.44]I can do it.
[286:36.64]I can get in this.
[287:10.45]Okay, this is kind of working.
[287:14.60]I can have infinity people in here, right?
[287:16.06]We're good.
[287:31.81]I just have to do this for another few minutes.
[287:35.55]Don't say we didn't warn you!
[287:45.54]This is cheating.
[287:46.96]You can call it whatever you want.
[287:47.94]I call it completion.
[287:50.90]Under any means necessary.
[287:52.33]Where's my timer?
[288:05.93]I'll have plenty of cops for whatever I need to blend the DNA with.
[288:08.74]Is this a cop?
[288:13.18]No.
[288:20.07]How long is this mission?
[288:20.91]It seems very long.
[288:22.47]Why is there a hippie in... Is it a cop hippie?
[288:24.61]I don't know.
[288:28.01]I'm not going to take the chance.
[288:29.11]Okay, we're good.
[288:33.83]Things are going well.
[288:39.23]Do I have to get close to the ground?
[288:55.80]Dead?
[288:56.44]Yep.
[289:05.82]Tent is being attacked even inside this fucking thing.
[289:18.13]This is hard.
[289:19.35]You probably have to do this with more upgraded weapons if you don't do the cheating like I am.
[289:32.20]35 seconds and then it's done.
[289:37.88]Who's left?
[289:38.38]Anybody around the side?
[289:39.55]Oh, they're in the camp now.
[289:46.39]Jesus Christ!
[289:47.49]12 seconds here.
[289:59.50]Look at how many cops are down here.
[290:06.42]Alright, I get it.
[290:07.90]Mission done.
[290:10.08]Cult survives police brutality.
[290:11.76]Botched hippie raid turns to slaughter.
[290:18.81]Got it.
[290:20.75]Alright, cool.
[290:21.61]So there's more.
[290:24.29]Ugh.
[290:26.46]Let me just see what it is.
[290:27.54]It's right here.
[290:28.16]Have I heard of Metal Arms?
[290:36.37]I have heard of Metal Arms.
[290:40.07]I never played it, though.
[290:40.87]At least, I don't think I ever did.
[290:43.83]I'm not sure I ever have.
[290:44.89]Continue the story?
[290:50.00]We will continue that next stream.
[290:53.28]Someone had to clean up America.
[290:55.44]You could always head back to an area.
[290:56.68]Yeah, I know.
[290:57.14]Uh, yeah, we'll do this later.
[290:59.21]Well, I can come back.
[291:00.55]I think this is a long line of these missions.
[291:18.47]This game's great though.
[291:19.09]I'm having a lot of fun.
[291:20.75]I highly recommend it.
[291:21.85]You can get it on PS4.
[291:23.91]I actually... I think it was... I don't think it's on sale anymore, but it was on sale for like five dollars.
[291:30.79]Is he gonna drive into him again?
[291:38.90]He's beeping at him.
[291:39.76]Don't you... Okay, if you were driving this car, wouldn't you be like, holy shit man, I... I don't... I don't think I should be beeping at this dude.
[291:55.46]He's almost dead.
[291:56.16]Don't even finish him off.
[291:59.20]Finish him.
[291:59.74]He's roadkill on the road.
[292:00.80]Do it.
[292:09.02]You're so close.
[292:10.18]I don't understand.
[292:14.00]Is he in the way?
[292:19.83]Alright, that's it.
[292:23.39]Goodbye.
[292:25.96]Thanks everybody for watching.
[292:28.16]Have a great rest of your night.
[292:30.62]I'll give you an update on what's going on this week, stream schedule wise.
[292:36.03]We're doing this like weird one day off, one day on, one day off, one day on, one day off, one day on thing, aren't we?
[292:40.81]Because that's exactly what's going to happen.
[292:43.09]Nothing tomorrow and then usually I would say because of all the stuff going on Thursday as well, but we're going to go Thursday.
[292:51.74]So we're going, not tomorrow, we're going Thursday.
[292:55.40]And then probably Friday in a row.
[293:01.56]And then after that, I think I have a lot of stuff to do this weekend into the early week.
[293:06.80]So we'll probably go Thursday, Friday.
[293:08.89]And then you might not see anything until like Monday or Tuesday, the 17th.
[293:15.65]Because there's a lot of stuff I got to get done.
[293:17.67]I'm moving in like less than a month and a half.
[293:21.03]So it's a lot of things I have to do.
[293:24.10]But I had a lot of fun tonight.
[293:26.02]I hope you guys had fun.
[293:28.50]So like back to the normal schedule, kind of, yeah.
[293:31.64]But then next week it's going to get even weirder because next week is going to be like Tuesday and then maybe Tuesday, Wednesday, and then Saturday.
[293:41.66]I'll let you know.
[293:42.16]We'll keep up to date about it.
[293:43.92]But that was Destroy All Humans 2.
[293:48.44]You'll see it again.
[293:49.46]It's a great game.
[293:50.10]I'm having a lot of fun.
[293:53.21]So, let's do the credits.

[296:54.04]Now let's do the bits.
[296:56.74]What do you say, huh?
[297:02.82]What do you say we get to the bits, huh?
[297:08.67]Music can come up a little bit here.
[297:11.89]But I will see you guys on Wednesday.
[297:15.11]No, what?
[297:15.99]Thursday.
[297:17.36]What a dummy.
[297:20.60]Somebody got bingo.
[297:22.28]You probably got bingo like 30 times.
[297:26.24]But thanks a lot, everybody.
[297:27.48]Here come the bits.
[297:28.92]Let's go all the way back here.
[297:30.04]Let's go back to where we were.
[297:33.45]Five hours ago here.
[297:34.83]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[297:36.15]After a few resets and setbacks, we finally made it to 10k saved seagulls.
[297:40.77]All these seagulls have a better home now.
[297:43.01]Proud of you, chat.
[297:46.38]Yeah, I mean, nice work.
[297:49.50]Good work, everybody.
[297:53.16]You did it.
[297:53.64]You saved them all.
[297:56.90]When you said you were going to look into Lisa, you weren't lying, right?
[297:59.69]It would be a fun stream.
[298:00.95]No, absolutely.
[298:01.89]Okay, I'm going to say a word here and tell me hot or cold.
[298:06.91]Undertale.
[298:15.67]Cold.
[298:17.32]Hot?
[298:17.94]Is it getting close there?
[298:19.18]Like, kind of like that?
[298:20.92]Cold.
[298:21.34]Okay, hold on.
[298:22.14]This is a 50-50 cold versus hot here.
[298:28.85]Okay.
[298:32.05]Okay.
[298:32.39]Well, yeah, no.
[298:33.31]I will actually, like, go and look at it.
[298:35.45]I swear.
[298:37.11]Thank you, Broluck, for the $2.
[298:37.97]I... P-O-G Dan H...
[298:44.85]Alright, PogChamp, Destroy All Humans 2.
[298:46.97]I get it.
[298:48.34]Hey, Joey Fettuccine, thanks for the $5.10.
[298:50.46]No message.
[298:51.14]Thanks a lot, man.
[298:52.86]Hey, Razzle, thanks for the $1.00.
[298:54.48]Read this out loud in a funny voice or I will curse you with something about a big hamburger.
[299:03.08]Read this in a funny voice.
[299:06.71]Read this in a funny voice, okay.
[299:09.87]Um...
[299:14.42]Read this in a funny... Read this out loud in a funny voice, or I'm gonna curse you.
[299:19.12]With whatever you said.
[299:21.37]Okay?
[299:22.73]There you go.
[299:25.85]Like, uh, whatever.
[299:26.63]Who gives a shit?
[299:33.61]Got it.
[299:35.34]Okay, um... Thank you.
[299:38.96]Thank you, uh, Joey Fettuccine again for the five dollars.
[299:43.17]Appreciate that, man.
[299:45.17]And then we had a string of somewhere around $300 fucking dollars here.
[299:51.47]Thank you all you guys that came in back to back to back here with a ton of money.
[299:56.27]Seriously, Scripps, Stormichu, StixRenegade, AceMcLace, you guys just dumped a huge amount of money in like 15 minutes.
[300:06.11]Thank you collectively, you guys, for like $300 fucking dollars.
[300:10.32]More than that.
[300:13.75]um but thank you thank you also to uh it's time for slime for the nine dollars passing my bingo winnings on to you thank you although I didn't know money was involved I appreciate that man thanks for the nine dollars thank you bro luck for the one dollar
[300:36.81]Having the bingo board about yourself being a fuckwit isn't so bad, and I and everybody in chat really enjoyed it.
[300:44.29]Fuck that guy who calls you an egomaniac.
[300:48.01]No, I think he was just kidding.
[300:53.04]I think he was just messing around.
[300:59.14]But, no, it's all good, man.
[301:01.52]We're just messing around.
[301:04.06]Egomaniac.
[301:09.74]Look at me.
[301:11.49]I was serious.
[301:13.29]Was he serious?
[301:14.51]Was he?
[301:14.85]I hope he wasn't.
[301:16.85]If he was, then I hope he watches this.
[301:20.55]And I hope he knows that I'm sorry you think that you feel that way.
[301:29.77]I was going to say thank you to that guy for the money.
[301:32.74]What?
[301:33.70]Thank you to that guy for the bits.
[301:35.40]I'm so lost right now.
[301:36.66]Anyways, thank you.
[301:38.71]Thank you, Rafmouse.
[301:41.05]Rafmoose for the $1.
[301:42.03]Hey, Jerma, I usually just say some stupid joke with bits, but I want you to know you're generally my favorite content creator and your videos have and are getting me through some hard times for about four or five years now.
[301:55.08]Good luck in Vegas.
[301:55.85]Don't lose all your money.
[301:59.21]I... First of all, thank you for those incredibly kind words.
[302:07.96]Sorry that you're going through some shit.
[302:10.66]Hopefully you get out of it soon.
[302:14.24]And thank you for the luck in Vegas.
[302:16.02]I'm not going to be gambling that much in Vegas.
[302:18.52]Only like four or five times a week.
[302:19.94]I'm going to learn poker and have it be my day job.
[302:24.98]And... But not that much, you know.
[302:28.63]But thank you, Raph.
[302:29.29]Appreciate it, man.
[302:30.97]Hey, SticksRenegade, thanks for the $1.
[302:32.41]GermoRatMovie1 and 2 on stream.
[302:33.97]I'll look into that.
[302:34.69]I'll look into that.
[302:35.61]Thanks, man.
[302:36.80]I mean, at what point do you get a wipey, man, and wipe it off?
[302:38.22]Four years?
[302:38.62]That's a long time.
[302:39.14]Jesus.
[302:39.36]It's now for a decoration.
[303:06.94]But thank you, Styx.
[303:09.82]Hey, VRJosh.
[303:12.18]Thank you for the $1 VR, Josh.
[303:13.72]Hey, Jerma, since you're moving to Las Vegas, I thought I should prepare you for the types of spiders you're likely to see around your new house.
[303:19.66]Oh, I know.
[303:20.90]Oh, I know, yeah.
[303:22.00]Sun spiders, sun scorpions, camel spiders.
[303:26.11]They're horrifying, and they're gigantic, and they're like mutants from alien movies.
[303:31.69]But it's okay.
[303:34.97]It's okay.
[303:39.98]The one thing that I can say is because I'll be living in Las Vegas, it's like a super developed part of Nevada, right?
[303:51.99]I've heard that those like huge creepy crawlies are more out in the outskirts of actual kind of country land in Nevada.
[304:06.02]I've heard that in like actual Las Vegas, they're not as prevalent.
[304:12.75]Keep telling yourself that.
[304:16.41]They're not in the city.
[304:17.55]That's what I'm talking about.
[304:18.39]They don't like roam the strip in like downtown Vegas.
[304:26.05]So that's what I've heard.
[304:27.75]I'm just going by like, I'm just going by what TripAdvisor.com has told me.
[304:34.07]When I say country, I'm not talking... Yeah, it's a desert.
[304:36.31]I know.
[304:41.67]Those of you that live in Nevada, am I correct in saying that in downtown, like in Vegas, the strip area, like in downtown Las Vegas, that there are not going to be fucking giant scorpions?
[304:56.28]Tell me now.
[304:59.40]I need to know.
[305:09.69]Sun spiders look scary, but you can let them crawl around on you.
[305:15.00]They're not venomous, so that's good.
[305:21.60]My dad caught a camel spider when he was deployed in a jar.
[305:24.89]He left it out in the hot sun and came back a few hours later and it burned.
[305:28.35]That's kind of morbid.
[305:34.29]The strip is made entirely out of scorpions.
[305:40.65]No, but... From my understanding, I should be okay.
[305:46.94]As long as I'm not out in, like, the desert portion of Nevada.
[305:51.40]If I'm in, like... Welcome to downtown!
[305:55.60]Then I should be fine.
[305:57.98]But, moving on.
[305:59.64]Palm put, thank you for the $50 earlier.
[306:01.54]We touched upon it.
[306:02.20]Again, part of, like, the quad trio of people that gave, like, $400.
[306:09.79]Thank you so much.
[306:13.43]Nevada is desert.
[306:14.41]I know.
[306:14.77]I know it is.
[306:15.53]But that doesn't mean that they don't build a bunch of shit to pretend like it's not.
[306:24.31]Sunspiders aren't even actually spiders.
[306:26.69]They're a different type of arachnid.
[306:28.77]They don't concern me.
[306:31.89]Yes, they do.
[306:32.41]I'm terrified.
[306:34.07]I'm just kind of burning it in the back of my mind.
[306:38.00]I'm gonna be like in front of the Bellagio and there's gonna be two sun spiders that are gonna get out of a lift.
[306:42.78]With like hats on and shirts on and shit.
[306:45.59]That's all I'm seeing.
[306:49.45]But thank you so much, Pomput.
[306:50.47]Thank you, Ivory, for the one dollar.
[306:53.07]on a serious note please do not kill the spider try and contain it via a glass most spiders fangs cannot pierce human skin because of how thick it is same for bee stings they're meant to do to harm but gets pulled out by your skin in case the bike gets worse take the spider to the doctors to quickly identify and treat do please do not die don't worry I didn't kill him I'm not gonna I don't kill spiders
[307:19.30]They do good things.
[307:20.22]I just don't like them crawling over my monitor and like on my groin and stuff when I'm looking down and it's just there.
[307:25.37]I can be afraid of spiders, but that doesn't mean I'm gonna kill them.
[307:39.26]Why do you feed chat like this?
[307:41.10]Because it's fucking fun!
[307:48.21]Hey, thank you, Broluck, for the one dollar.
[307:51.13]I don't know what you're scared of, mate.
[307:52.45]It's just a small little cute spider who'll keep all the other bad bugs away from you.
[307:56.21]Treat him well and do not kill him.
[307:57.49]I'm not gonna kill him!
[307:59.88]I know.
[308:00.92]Why do you think I didn't even attempt to get rid of him?
[308:04.68]I hope he makes a giant family.
[308:07.24]No, I don't.
[308:07.76]I hope he, like, goes outside and eats a bunch of bugs in heaven and has a nice long spider life out there.
[308:16.17]I'm not gonna kill him.
[308:18.30]I will not.
[308:21.22]Oh, there he is.
[308:21.68]Oh, shit.
[308:23.06]Oh, my God.
[308:23.44]There he is.
[308:23.76]He actually just popped up.
[308:25.42]Got him.
[308:26.60]Got him.
[308:27.04]Killed the son of a bitch.
[308:29.47]Got him.
[308:31.29]Whew.
[308:32.03]Got him.
[308:32.75]Thank God.
[308:34.25]Oh, I couldn't put up with that bullshit no more.
[308:36.11]I couldn't put that act on anymore.
[308:37.63]He's gone.
[308:37.95]Oh, my God.
[308:41.58]It's fucking fun.
[308:43.38]Hey, thank you, too.
[308:46.10]Give your heart to me.
[308:47.38]Thanks for the two.
[308:48.76]Thanks for the three bucks man.
[308:49.72]He says party party party.
[308:50.88]Thanks a lot No, I'm not gonna eat it Yeah Hey, thank you though.
[309:03.38]Thank you the three dollars do thank you spree over the one dollar I Legitimately got scared when you showed that spider.
[309:08.44]So don't listen to chat.
[309:09.38]It's scary stuff.
[309:10.22]Oh
[309:15.20]Look, you gotta give me some credit here.
[309:17.08]Give me some slack.
[309:18.79]Think of everything you've ever seen that was a horror movie or something scary or a TV show.
[309:28.04]Though the way that they look, all of our monsters are based off of spiders.
[309:34.09]Look at every horror fucking monster movie.
[309:36.25]They all like our big long legs and big fucking fangs coming out of their teeth.
[309:42.08]We are conditioned to be terrified of spiders.
[309:44.90]Because, duh, they all, you know what I'm saying?
[309:49.40]It's true.
[309:52.98]Spiders just look like every fucking monster from every awful monster movie.
[310:02.31]If we didn't base a bunch of our characters on that, it wouldn't be like that.
[310:05.67]You wouldn't be scared of them.
[310:07.04]Are you scared of a frog?
[310:08.86]No.
[310:09.56]But if there was giant frogs that ate people and swallowed them and fucking crushed their bones in their mouth, you would be scared of frogs.
[310:16.52]As a child, you would see that on TV.
[310:18.49]You would see the weird frog fucking monster with a big mouth and his head comes up.
[310:23.03]You'd be scared of frogs.
[310:24.27]Because that's all you've seen.
[310:33.60]What came first, the spider or the monster?
[310:34.96]The spider came first because that's what we base it all on.
[310:38.12]Watch this.
[310:38.70]You think I'm making shit up?
[310:39.74]You guys think I'm bullshitting you?
[310:40.81]I'm going to type in giant monster.
[310:45.95]Giant monster.
[310:46.65]And let's see how many of these are based off of a fucking spider.
[310:51.20]Oh, what's that?
[310:52.00]Take a look.
[310:52.98]Go to Google Images and type in giant monster.
[310:55.90]Second image, that looks a lot like a spider.
[310:58.16]Third one is Godzilla.
[310:59.52]That don't fucking count.
[311:00.92]Fourth one, winged spider.
[311:02.88]The fifth image is actually three giant fucking spiders.
[311:06.74]Image number six is Godzilla again, doesn't count.
[311:11.04]Image number seven, that's a giant spider.
[311:14.54]Image number eight is Godzilla again, doesn't count.
[311:17.02]Hey, what's that?
[311:18.14]Image number nine is something.
[311:19.74]Image 10 is a fucking spider.
[311:22.64]It's a giant spider.
[311:25.83]Do I need to show this on screen?
[311:39.41]Here.
[311:41.07]Take a look.
[311:43.15]You can go over it yourself.
[311:44.91]You guys thought I was mad.
[311:47.59]He's gone absolutely mad.
[311:48.95]He's fucking crazy.
[311:51.55]Is he though?
[311:53.00]You tell me.
[311:57.84]Again, this is the Google image search for giant monster.
[312:03.08]Okay?
[312:10.50]Let's take a look.
[312:14.08]Giant monster.
[312:18.88]So guys, you tell me how many of those things are spiders?
[312:22.70]Huh?
[312:23.64]At least half the things on this list is a spider.
[312:35.27]Five and ten are the same spider.
[312:36.59]That doesn't matter.
[312:38.41]It's all Godzilla and spiders.
[312:43.72]So you- Okay, so let's just say there's three spiders.
[312:45.82]That's 30%.
[312:46.04]33% of every image on this screen is a fucking spider.
[312:54.80]I don't know what one is supposed to be.
[312:56.38]What is that supposed to be?
[313:00.62]That's a Dark Souls boss, whatever it is.
[313:02.90]Two, that's a spider.
[313:08.58]That's a small sample size?
[313:09.96]No, it's not, because these are the top searches.
[313:13.48]These are the first half dozen or so.
[313:16.53]The first 12.
[313:17.93]That means that the people are terrified of these.
[313:19.57]These are the most scary monsters you can fucking find in the wild.
[313:23.55]My case needs to be... Let's rest my case.
[313:30.21]Look, the giant, like, crab spider thing, that's a spider.
[313:34.05]That counts as a spider.
[313:38.99]Godzilla doesn't count because obviously Godzilla is like the mainstream, like, normie monster that everyone like, oh, Godzilla, yeah, he's a monster.
[313:50.12]I did, I just said that, didn't I?
[313:54.50]You know what I'm talking about.
[313:55.94]Alright, let's go.
[313:57.90]Why do I, what is this?
[313:59.74]Go back.
[314:07.23]I don't even need to explain that.
[314:08.95]You guys know exactly what I'm talking about.
[314:10.50]Alright.
[314:15.32]Let's go back to the bits.
[314:19.54]To prove I was wrong about scary insects.
[314:28.12]Hey, thank you.
[314:30.53]Thank you.
[314:31.99]To...
[314:34.79]Uh, give you a heart.
[314:35.97]Give you a heart.
[314:37.95]I'm gonna... Jongus?
[314:41.67]Try to get that right.
[314:42.29]Thanks for the ten bucks, man.
[314:43.99]Give you a heart to me.
[314:45.65]Thank you so much.
[314:48.29]A wasp is more terrifying than a spider?
[314:49.87]Yeah, but a wasp doesn't look as scary as a spider.
[314:54.12]They don't have like the huge, weird, curled up, 90 degree angle legs.
[315:00.48]And when a spider dies, their legs shrivel up and point.
[315:04.34]It's... It's just... Ugh.
[315:11.93]Now, wasps aren't even scary, though, because how I look at... Yeah, wasps, they might be more dangerous, but they just kind of look like a bee's Disney movie mean older brother.
[315:23.82]You know what I mean?
[315:26.89]I find them kind of like, whatever, you're like Biff.
[315:37.17]You're like the Chad B. Who cares?
[315:41.95]That was the second thing I've said.
[315:49.23]Don't at me.
[315:55.52]Anyways.
[316:02.98]Wasp versus the Virgin Bee.
[316:08.52]You could probably make a pretty good one.
[316:10.60]You really could.
[316:12.90]Think about it.
[316:13.96]Or Hornet.
[316:14.63]Chad Hornet versus Virgin Bee.
[316:17.43]Think of the two things that they do.
[316:18.89]Think of the bee has to work its ass off making honey for everybody while the Chad Wasp just goes in and takes it.
[316:25.31]You could make it.
[316:25.73]Somebody make it.
[316:27.03]Just like credit me in the bottom right.
[316:28.39]Like a little bit.
[316:28.91]Like 10%.
[316:34.57]Chad, like, eats the bees and, like, eats the honey inside the nest.
[316:44.93]89%.
[316:49.03]Do wasps do anything worthwhile?
[316:53.80]I don't know.
[316:54.12]I think, well, there's, like, mud wasps, right?
[316:58.22]Don't they, like, till the soil or something?
[317:01.54]Am I making that up?
[317:07.50]That's it.
[317:07.86]Nothing.
[317:08.12]They're useless.
[317:12.12]They feed birds.
[317:12.92]That's true.
[317:15.60]Daubers don't hurt you.
[317:16.86]No, they don't.
[317:17.24]Yeah, daubers are pretty... Daubies are really nice.
[317:21.28]They're good elves.
[317:22.80]Alright.
[317:23.02]Thank you, Zero, for the $1.
[317:25.24]How would you feel about playing a Jerma fan game if somebody ever made one?
[317:30.40]Maybe.
[317:31.26]I'll look into that.
[317:33.36]No, but like, shitty jokes aside, um... It would have to really be... What?
[317:40.16]I don't know.
[317:40.62]I feel like it'd be scary to play through one of those because somebody could just... Hey, I'm playing, walking through like an FPS level and all of a sudden I look over there and there's like a naked person.
[317:49.69]It's just on the wall like a spray in TF2.
[317:52.51]Remember that shit?
[317:55.69]Remember like sprays in TF2 or in Counter-Strike?
[317:59.02]You just walk out of spawn and they'd be like, well, there's something fucking horrible on the wall.
[318:04.46]Glad I got to look at that.
[318:05.50]Glad that's like saved in my cache in like my TF2 folder.
[318:14.61]Yeah, I gotta be careful.
[318:17.21]I would, but just don't TF2 spray me.
[318:19.08]You know what I mean?
[318:24.21]They don't get saved?
[318:25.03]Yeah, but they still appeared on my monitor.
[318:30.56]That was the first time I ever saw porn.
[318:34.86]Jesus.
[318:37.23]Thank you, though.
[318:37.59]Thank you, Asian Turtle, for the $1.
[318:39.87]These spiders got you jumping like fleas on a dog's back.
[318:43.51]When you make the journey down south, make sure you spray your house with some pest killer.
[318:47.43]Just last night, I was in bed watching the Dark Souls PvP vault on my phone when I saw a centipede slithered across my pillow.
[318:54.52]Like any man would, I flung it across the room and slept in my car.
[319:02.76]That's terrifying.
[319:03.42]But it's okay.
[319:03.81]Centipedes and...
[319:06.54]Centipedes don't scare me.
[319:07.59]Centipedes are just like moving pieces of lint.
[319:12.09]Right?
[319:12.29]They don't really do anything.
[319:13.85]It's just like a bunch of dusty hair like moves across the floor.
[319:17.23]It's okay.
[319:22.39]Centipedes bite you?
[319:24.91]What, are you serious?
[319:27.05]Centipedes are really dangerous?
[319:28.37]Don't say that.
[319:34.11]Centipedes are dangerous.
[319:40.23]Centipedes can kill you.
[319:46.25]Alright, what can I have?
[319:47.27]You know what?
[319:48.19]I'm getting a lizard.
[319:50.05]You heard it.
[319:50.37]I'm telling you right now.
[319:51.91]I'm going to go to the store and I'm going to buy a fucking iguana.
[319:56.88]And it's going to hang out in the house.
[319:59.16]Just eat all the goddamn fucking spiders and ants and bugs and... I'm just buying a giant lizard and it's going to be just... It doesn't even matter.
[320:06.04]It's going to be in the house.
[320:06.66]It's going to be the house guard.
[320:11.54]Eat the centipedes.
[320:12.36]Get a fucking iguana so it just tail whips the thing.
[320:17.24]Lizards can kill you too, not when they're your friends that you buy at the pet store.
[320:23.76]What would be better for that situation?
[320:26.00]Like a bullfrog or a giant lizard?
[320:29.28]What is the... You know, what's like the innate for... You know, what's like the Pokémon thing here?
[320:34.89]Like water to fire, you know what I mean?
[320:37.57]Frog or... Does frog beat centipede or does centipede beat frog?
[320:47.04]Frog.
[320:48.26]Frog.
[320:49.20]Virgin frog.
[320:50.20]Chad Iguana.
[320:56.79]A frog wins?
[320:58.63]Yeah, frogs do just swallow everything, right?
[321:04.44]I can imagine that a lizard wouldn't care, but a frog would just, like, eat it really fast.
[321:10.10]Alright, I'm gonna get a bullfrog.
[321:18.37]Yep, it's confirmed.
[321:21.99]I'm going to get, like, the biggest frog I can buy, and it's gonna hang out in the house.
[321:27.77]Oh, you got a centipede problem?
[321:28.79]No, you don't.
[321:29.13]You got a bullfrog solution.
[321:35.86]Let's get a bunch of frogs.
[321:36.90]Get, like, ten frogs.
[321:38.00]However many rooms are in this place, there's gonna be a frog per room.
[321:45.81]That's my, like, alarm system.
[321:53.70]frogs are cannibals they'll just eat each other I come home one day and oh I had like seven frogs now I have one really big frog he's just sitting in the corner like overeating just huge he's lying on his back get the door get the door turn on the AC holy shit
[322:24.19]Oh, I need to look this up.
[322:28.09]Best Centipede Killer.
[322:33.13]No, this is just like spray bottles.
[322:39.49]No, I don't want to get like the spray bottle.
[322:41.31]Holy shit, these things are insane looking.
[322:50.19]They crawl all over you and bite you while you sleep.
[322:52.50]What?! !
[323:02.50]What is the anti-centipede?
[323:04.16]Keep your house dry Close off the entrance points Reduce clutter Okay, I thought this just said get a frog but I know it says use a fog or a spray

[323:57.67]You're looking for, like, this confirmation bias of something cool.
[324:01.33]Like, oh, frog kills centipede.
[324:03.81]Yeah, they did.
[324:04.49]Yeah, they do that.
[324:05.75]I love frogs.
[324:06.75]Or alligator befriends human.
[324:09.05]See, they're docile.
[324:09.89]You're right, they're docile.
[324:10.77]You look for the one fucking article, the one video that you can, like, look at and be like, yeah, man.
[324:14.50]Or buffalo saves dog.
[324:17.92]Yeah, the buffalo saved a dog one time.
[324:19.92]They're so fucking cool.
[324:21.40]Look.
[324:25.95]Frogs do actually eat centipedes.
[324:30.85]You actually... No, I do that all the time.
[324:32.17]Is the spider still in the room?
[324:38.22]Yes, it is.
[324:41.28]It's still here, Boo.
[324:43.16]I need to get myself a frog to eat the spiders.
[324:46.50]But anyways, let's keep going with the bits.

[326:14.12]That's what it was.
[326:17.68]I think, no, this is, guys, here's, let me explain something to you.
[326:20.70]Memes are like clothes and styles, right?
[326:23.60]So, you know how, oh, bell-bottoms are coming back.
[326:27.29]Because nobody knows any other fucking clothes to wear.
[326:29.53]It's just recycled what your grandmother wore.
[326:31.53]And then, like, now, the next generation doesn't think that's cool.
[326:34.60]Generation after that doesn't think it's cool.
[326:36.46]The generation after that one is like, oh, bell-bottoms are fucking awesome.
[326:39.14]I love that, like, the big funny hats they used to wear in the renaissance.
[326:42.90]memes are the same way so like rick rolling I guess now because it's been like a full generation oh yeah I love this one let's wear this again giant dad is like blue jeans he's never gonna go out of style that's I mean there are some aren't you old yeah I am

[329:11.48]Sometimes I forget that internet, like, internet culture is, like, times 500 speed.
[329:17.95]So something from, like, a year ago may as well be from, like, 1996.
[329:21.43]Sometimes I forget.

[330:35.26]Have it all.
[330:35.90]Experience the world.
[330:37.88]Oh, shit.
[330:38.12]What time is it?
[330:38.56]Sushi.
[330:39.04]I gotta get sushi.
[330:39.62]What time is it?
[330:40.14]Spider's back.
[330:41.55]I moved something and he fucking jumped out.
[330:50.65]Bye.
[330:52.01]No, I can't kill it.
[330:58.99]I do it because it's fucking fun.
[331:03.87]Hey, thank you too.
[331:07.63]Hey, false appetite.
[331:09.75]No, that's not your name and that's not enough, bitch.
[331:14.50]Hey, GarfieldTheMondayKiller.
[331:15.90]Hey, come on there.
[331:16.82]Jerma, you skipped a Garf comic yesterday.
[331:18.68]Makes me, makes me angry.
[331:20.88]My Garfographs are long and the comics just add more mess.
[331:23.96]So I bring to you and Chad a question.
[331:26.58]Who takes the ball?
[331:27.69]The comics or the Garfagraphs?
[331:29.05]Who gets to stay and who gets spayed?
[331:31.57]That or I can send two bit messages, one for Garfagraphs and one for comics.
[331:37.47]You decide.
[331:41.78]He's further away from the mic.
[331:43.54]How would you know that?
[331:45.20]Of course you would know that because I'm further away from the mic.
[331:48.62]Here's the latest Garfield strip.
[331:51.23]Take it.
[331:51.71]Look at it.
[331:52.67]There it is.
[331:55.12]This Jerma book you're writing is going smoothly, Garfield.
[331:58.16]All these different routes, the jokes are all on point.
[332:00.24]You wrote Otto to be so adorable.
[332:04.98]It could use a few more short jokes, though.
[332:07.02]Know what I'm saying?
[332:10.57]I really have to stop inviting John into the Garf comics.
[332:12.89]If he keeps reaching for low-hanging fruit, we'll start hearing furry jokes.
[332:15.87]Look at you.
[332:22.25]What's wrong with this Garfield guy?
[332:25.58]I'm in a laughing mood right now.
[332:27.14]You know, the spider jumped out and now I'm like fucking energized.
[332:31.50]You know what?
[332:32.76]Why don't we run a mile?
[332:34.60]Why don't I just turn an IRL stream on, get my phone out, turn the IRL on and just go fucking run outside until I get tired.
[332:41.07]How far can I go do you think?
[332:43.51]If I just open my front door and start running, just sprinting, how far do you think I'll get?
[332:50.95]And I'm talking like
[332:55.50]Alright, let's go!
[333:28.85]I can't.
[333:29.05]I can't fucking do it.
[333:29.53]It's not gonna happen.
[333:31.27]I can't do it.
[333:31.79]I can't fucking do it.
[333:35.53]Phone ran out of battery.
[333:38.68]I was about to press the live button, but my phone went to zero.
[333:45.48]I made it pretty fast, though.
[333:46.62]Man, I made it out the fucking door like half mile.
[333:54.06]Thank you.
[333:59.86]Thanks, Garfield.
[334:00.92]Thank you to Raised to Make for the $1.20.
[334:05.63]Just want to say thanks for making me laugh and generally making my life happier.
[334:08.65]Thanks, man.
[334:11.13]Appreciate that.
[334:16.00]This is fake breathing.
[334:17.90]I'm not, listen, I won't take, look it, I'm fine.
[334:20.38]That was me fake running, fake acting, actor, acting, actor.
[334:26.53]I'm fine.
[334:28.77]That was a, that was, you've been had.
[334:30.47]That was a play.
[334:31.91]Welcome to the fucking audience and clap for me.
[334:41.49]So was the spider?
[334:42.25]The spider was not even real the whole time.
[334:43.77]That was a mechanical spider.
[334:46.14]You guys, this is part of a had.
[334:49.08]You've been had.
[334:50.78]I made a little robot spider and it crawled across the top and it was made with like CGI and robotics.
[334:57.28]I'm practicing to get in the big fucking movie, you understand?
[335:10.69]The Wild West Robot Spider.
[335:12.49]Wow, that's... That's a great reference.
[335:17.33]Thank you, Garfield.
[335:17.95]Thank you, Raise to Make for the $1.20.
[335:19.31]Just wanted to say thanks.
[335:20.31]Thank you, too.
[335:21.37]Thanks for sticking around.
[335:22.07]GarfieldTheMondayKiller.
[335:22.89]No, no, no, no, no.
[335:23.41]You get one Garfield comic book a day.
[335:25.49]What's going on here?
[335:28.85]My secretary thought you'd really get a kick out of yesterday's comic.
[335:32.03]I don't know about recycling old material, but here it is for your viewing pleasure.
[335:34.77]I hope it gives you a gaggle of gaggles.
[335:37.63]Here it is.
[335:38.33]This is two.
[335:38.93]There's not two Garfield strips in a day.
[335:41.93]We already saw this one.
[335:44.51]We saw this one.
[335:45.59]I didn't read it out loud.
[335:47.88]Join the fight, you know?
[335:49.20]You wanna?
[335:49.58]Don't choke on smoke.
[335:50.56]Eat lasagna.
[335:51.14]I've read this one.
[335:55.55]This is like me when I was a figure of acting.
[335:57.71]This is me getting denied when I was like 14 for the smoking ad that I was supposed to... I killed it.
[336:04.15]I was perfect.
[336:10.97]I've legit have been trying to describe the post stream to product managers at Twitch, trying to explain how this is the best thing on the whole site.
[336:25.89]Product managers.
[336:26.91]They're going to open the stream up and be like, this guy has a partnership.
[336:34.11]Let me see that for a second.
[336:34.93]Let me see that paper for a second.
[336:38.47]Get him out of here.
[336:45.89]I appreciate that.
[336:46.65]Thanks, dude.
[336:51.13]But thank you, GarfieldTheMondayKiller.
[336:52.61]Thank you, Sticks Renegade, for the one dollar.
[336:56.47]Uh... Natto is something I eat, but people dislike.
[336:59.73]It's fermented soybeans.
[337:00.83]It's stinky, gooey, and slimy.
[337:03.99]I would not eat it.
[337:04.55]It reminds me of a centipede.
[337:06.25]You just described a centipede.
[337:07.68]Just say that there's legs on it.
[337:09.56]And you've got... I'm gonna buy Frog to make sure he eats it.
[337:14.57]Oh, I've lost my fucking mind tonight, seriously.
[337:20.05]Uh, thank you, those sticks.
[337:20.89]Thank you, Casey, for the one dollar.
[337:22.03]Here's some money for the office urinal fund.
[337:25.03]He put office in quotes.
[337:26.74]Mocking me.
[337:28.18]Mocking my down here office that I have that is very clearly an office.
[337:31.34]I could give you an office tour later if you want.
[337:33.00]Alright, well I'm gonna do like a three or four hour office tour.
[337:36.78]Okay?
[337:37.66]Let's start it.
[337:38.54]It's gonna take about three or four hours.
[337:40.32]I'm gonna show you the whole thing.
[337:50.05]Okay, so we got, if you take a look over here, we got window, back wall with some office material on it.
[338:00.17]That's to stop the noise.
[338:03.00]There's a microphone right here, right here.
[338:07.42]There's a desk here.
[338:11.98]Oh, by the way, there's also the TV.
[338:15.42]It's still there.
[338:17.68]I can't move it.
[338:22.00]I actually can't move it.
[338:22.96]It's too big.
[338:24.90]It's too big.
[338:25.43]It's here forever.
[338:25.97]Alright, let's try to find that spider.
[338:31.57]What do you say?
[338:33.87]Just leave it in the house.
[338:35.15]I just don't even get rid of it.
[338:43.54]And the people that move in here have to deal with it.
[338:46.58]That's my office.
[338:47.88]Got everything you need.
[338:48.54]Got a desk, got a TV, microphone, a wall, office material, foam pads to make it so I can scream in here.
[338:54.87]What do you mean you thought it was gone?
[338:58.83]I physically can't pick it up.
[339:01.05]How am I going to get it out of here?
[339:01.87]I've got to call a company.
[339:03.39]I have to pay a company to come get this out of my room.
[339:07.89]TV in front of the door.
[339:10.22]It's hard over here.
[339:15.30]Stream in quotes?
[339:16.58]Hey, excuse me.
[339:19.82]Okay, I was going to say click ban.
[339:21.44]I almost gifted that guy a subscription.
[339:26.65]He already has one, though.
[339:27.55]Thanks, welcome.
[339:28.35]Thanks, what's up?
[339:34.23]What are my thoughts on pumpkin seeds?
[339:36.19]That's a yuck-a-rino for me.
[339:39.17]Thank you, Casey, though.
[339:39.97]Thank you, Kilgannon, for the $1.
[339:42.17]You don't add a beat emote after this stream, you're disgusting.
[339:45.37]I said the word beat like nine times today.
[339:48.09]That's not worth an emote.
[339:48.99]We have to repeat a joke like 400 times before it becomes an emote.
[339:53.93]Or it has to be a shitty planet.
[339:57.50]Uh, thank you, though.
[339:58.02]Thank you, Flank Tank, for the $1.
[339:59.42]Would you rather fight one Jermajoop-sized Glue Man or a hundred Glue Man-sized Jermajupitus?
[340:03.58]Well, one of those is a hundred Jupitus, so that one's going to win every time.
[340:07.28]So the one small-sized Jermajupita-Glue Man one.
[340:10.63]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $1.
[340:12.21]No, one of the best videos on YouTube is, um, dying.
[340:17.53]I don't know what that is.
[340:20.51]Hey, Snooze and Cocter, thanks for the $1.
[340:22.01]Here's something I stumbled upon.
[340:23.11]The local news is truly something wonderful, isn't it?
[340:27.01]okay let's see uh this is a Twitter link it says beautiful this boy put the basketball under his shirt and now he's pregnant with the basketball this is the kid with the basketball under his shirt okay

[341:20.57]A few weeks ago, I was trying to fall asleep and I heard something fall off my dresser next to my bed.
[341:26.73]I was going to ignore it, but I got up to see anyway.
[341:29.62]I'm glad I did because what sounded like an object falling on the floor was a huge spider onto my bed.
[341:37.10]Feel free to share this with chat.
[341:38.78]It was the size of the palm of my hand.
[341:40.54]I don't like killing stuff, so I managed to get it outside.
[341:48.13]AHH!
[341:49.73]Oh God, it's here.
[341:50.81]It's in my house.
[341:51.65]It's in my room.
[341:55.47]Oh fucking God.
[341:56.39]I can't even look at it.
[341:57.35]It's in my room.
[342:03.50]Hold on.
[342:07.10]It's a scary looking one too.
[342:08.38]Fuck man.
[342:09.08]I can't even touch my computer.
[342:17.12]Hold on.
[342:17.50]Okay.
[342:19.15]I'm shy.
[342:19.95]Ah, I'll show it.
[342:20.39]I'll show it.
[342:20.71]Hold on.
[342:26.43]God damn it, man.
[342:27.35]It's a scary one.
[342:28.21]Like, some of them are, like, funny looking and, like, that's a scary one.
[342:32.23]Fuck me.
[342:32.77]I can't even touch it.
[342:35.79]I feel like that's inside my mouth right now.
[342:37.49]I swear to God.
[342:39.67]He's adorable.
[342:40.25]No, no, he's not.
[342:41.39]He's... He's not tiny.
[342:43.32]He's not tiny.
[342:43.80]That's not tiny.
[342:46.14]Do I have arachnophobia?
[342:47.28]No, I do not.
[342:48.14]Absolutely not.
[342:49.34]I'm not afraid of spiders.
[342:51.42]I just don't like being around them.
[342:54.20]I'm not afraid of airplanes.
[342:55.94]I just don't like flying in them.
[342:58.02]I'm fine.
[343:06.64]I'm fine.
[343:07.01]Everything's fine.
[343:07.73]But, yeah, that's... It's just fear.
[343:11.09]It's fear because it looks like a stone enemy from...
[343:15.71]Like a horror game.
[343:16.71]Like a horror game.
[343:17.89]Horror movies.
[343:20.32]Giant monster Google search.
[343:22.54]We just did it.
[343:27.52]Oh, man.
[343:30.30]I'm going to think that they're going to have nightmares of them crawling in my nose tonight.
[343:35.60]Fear but not a phobia.
[343:37.24]No, that's not... I would say dislike but not afraid.
[343:40.90]I'm a Chad.
[343:42.00]I'm not a virgin spider-afraid-er.
[343:47.76]Hey, thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[343:49.90]Here's your raw broccoli.
[343:51.24]Thank you.
[343:56.94]Thanks a lot, man.
[343:58.18]Hey, Smelly Boy, thanks for the $1.
[343:59.42]Streamer laughs as the life drains from the eyes of... I wasn't... No, we were not laughing.
[344:04.59]We were just... Look, I wasn't laughing.
[344:07.09]I just had controlled breaths with sounds of enjoyment coming out of my esophagus.
[344:13.83]I wasn't laughing.
[344:15.21]It was different.
[344:19.61]I've got another YouTube link to click, so let's mute the stream before I get in trouble.
[344:24.60]Let's see what it is.
[344:27.16]Well, that... Okay, well, I don't understand.
[344:32.50]This is a bunch of broccoli being destroyed.
[344:36.48]Why is this person destroying broccoli?
[344:37.80]I don't get it.
[344:45.47]Oh, this guy's eating the broccoli.
[344:51.11]Okay, it's a guy eating a fucking whole head of 500 grams of raw broccoli, eating it.
[344:56.34]So that was real.
[344:57.04]Okay, well, if you want to check it out, here it is.
[345:00.12]Guy eats a raw broccoli.
[345:03.96]A shitload of it.
[345:04.62]And it's like a challenge video where he's like a super eater.
[345:10.08]Red Faction Guerrilla Remastered is only slightly better looking than the original and nothing else has changed.
[345:16.26]Well, that's unfortunate because Red Faction Guerrilla is probably one of my favorite games that I've played on stream in the last couple years.
[345:24.42]That game is fantastic.
[345:26.19]That game is absolutely fucking phenomenal.
[345:28.43]So if you've never played it before, then it's worth getting it just to have it because the remaster is at least there.
[345:38.39]Anyways.
[345:42.90]Thank you, Casey.
[345:43.50]Thank you, Kilgannon, for the $1.
[345:44.90]Skylanders Academy has Jonathan Banks, Mike from Breaking Bad, he's a good actor, Norm Macdonald, Bobcat Goldthwait, Justin Long, Billy West, and Richard Horvitz.
[345:59.95]It's actually a pretty good show, despite looking dumb.
[346:02.30]I was surprised to see how star-studded the cast is.
[346:05.08]You can watch it on Netflix.
[346:06.44]Really?
[346:10.12]Was I just getting choked from behind?
[346:11.64]Well, yeah, and I fucking karate'd them before you guys could even hear it.
[346:17.75]That's interesting, though.
[346:20.73]Skylanders Academy.
[346:22.83]Maybe I'll skip through one episode and listen to Jonathan Banks' character and then be like, ah, that's pretty neat.
[346:29.62]Hey, SuperBurgerFlipper, thanks for the $1.50.
[346:31.68]Hey, Jerm, I finally get to subbing after so many years.
[346:33.20]I'm watching you on YouTube and like since February of last year on Twitch.
[346:38.05]Still binge watch your old videos sometimes, too.
[346:40.63]Also, I was DuelistDuper on the Dark Souls Remastered PvP stream.
[346:43.99]It was pretty embarrassing at first, getting insta-killed and all that twice.
[346:50.68]I mean, hey, I did okay with the well time.
[346:53.34]With the well, my brain, there's a spider in my brain.
[346:56.88]Hey, I did okay well the third time.
[346:59.98]But I feel really lucky to have been summoned like three times.
[347:03.22]Love all the content.
[347:03.92]Can't wait for what you have in store.
[347:06.52]Thank you so much, Burger Flipper.

[348:48.50]Is the button that he's pressing controlling my head?
[348:51.12]Is this an animatronic Jeremy?
[348:53.50]Or is that me saying no?
[348:54.80]Or is he just testing out his new robotic spider that he just got?
[349:03.78]That's pretty sweet, man.
[349:04.56]Thank you.

[350:57.71]Thank you, Broluck, for the one dollar.
[351:01.09]Jeremiah, I was digging up a drive way for a family member.
[351:05.71]There were seven or eight funnel web spiders coming out and trying to attack us.
[351:10.59]We just put them into a container and moved them.
[351:12.55]Spiders ain't scary.
[351:16.98]What does a funnel web spider look like?
[351:20.98]Let's see if it's... Let's see.
[351:22.96]Funnel web spider.
[351:32.21]Yeah, no, thanks. Somebody remind me to never live in Australia. For any reason.
[351:38.21]Like okay, you can you can tell me: Hey Jeremy, you know that I got a house for you that I'd like you to live in. In the front door, there is-
[351:47.21]It's a 12 bedroom house.
[351:48.68]It's like you have 6,200 square feet. It's huge. And the front door- and across the kitchen table on- right when you walk in: there is five briefcases.
[351:58.78]One of the briefcases is full of like 50 million dollars in cash, it's stacked up there.
[352:04.78]It's- there's like- there's a ton of money.
[352:06.78]In one of those other cases is uh- the cure for every disease you could ever have.
[352:11.78]Literally it's just in a vial, you can take it and you'll never have- you'll be- you'll never have a disease ever. It's gone.
[352:16.00]Uh in the last two briefcases all the soylent you could ever want to drink. A ton of it.
[352:20.00]I'm that- I would love it.
[352:21.00]So, I walk in there and you tell me that I have to live with those spiders.
[352:25.00]No, I will deny. I will refuse.
[352:32.10]I wouldn't go.
[352:34.48]If you told me that there was a chance that in five years I'd see one of those... I wouldn't go.
[352:41.00]I'm not afraid of spiders.
[352:42.34]I just wouldn't... I don't want to deal with that.
[352:43.52]I don't want to be around them.
[352:44.78]Alright, that was like three references to like four hours ago.
[352:52.42]So sorry for the people that recently just got here.
[352:55.42]And they have no fucking idea what's going on.
[352:59.72]Those spiders can actually kill you, by the way.
[353:03.72]exactly I don't want to die from some spider that's not how I want to go what's that age what's that age old joke no that's that's like that's like too hot for TV that's too hot for TV hey thank you

[353:42.27]Hey, Poop Train Conductor, thanks for the $1.
[353:44.71]They just, they say they're going to, that's fine?

[353:52.47]Thank you.
[353:53.24]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[353:55.36]Virgin Jerma versus Chad B. You got it the other way around.

[354:09.04]I can't hear it.
[354:10.00]Let me be able to hear it.
[354:13.42]What does this mean?
[354:13.88]Okay.
[354:17.34]It's a clip.
[354:19.28]I'm not going to kill him.
[354:21.42]I will not.
[354:24.37]Oh, there he is.
[354:24.81]Oh, shit.
[354:26.17]Oh, my God.
[354:26.59]There he is.
[354:26.91]He actually just popped up.
[354:28.57]Got him.
[354:29.75]Got him.
[354:30.09]Killed the son of a bitch.
[354:32.91]What did I kill?
[354:35.17]Got him.
[354:35.89]Thank God.
[354:37.38]Oh, hold on.
[354:37.86]What did I kill here?
[354:39.32]What am I talking about?
[354:46.04]Is it the spider?
[354:50.57]What spider?
[354:53.65]Did I just... Did I say that earlier?
[354:55.15]No.
[354:59.15]I thought that sounded like that was probably from like a year ago.
[355:01.25]Whatever.
[355:04.44]Whatever.
[355:06.81]Thanks, man.
[355:08.15]For whatever happened, I don't know.
[355:16.99]He's making all kinds of callbacks tonight.
[355:21.89]Hey, Meradical.
[355:24.09]Meradical.
[355:24.87]Thank you for the $1.
[355:25.61]Hey, Jerma.
[355:25.95]Lots of people have been sharing pictures of their dogs lately, but I don't have a dog.
[355:28.90]Here's a picture of... He said it's a picture of his dick, so I'm not going to click it.
[355:32.88]I don't even know what it is.
[355:33.72]I don't care what it is.
[355:35.94]That could be a picture of a million dollars in a briefcase, and I'm not going to clean it.
[355:44.61]Thank you.
[355:45.77]I appreciate that, man.
[355:50.83]Thank you, eefs, for the $2.45.
[355:51.66]Thanks a lot, man.
[355:52.70]Hey, Jerma, I didn't get to see the stream tonight.
[355:55.28]I went to the premiere of Attack on Titan Season 3.
[355:58.14]But I'll watch the VOD, and I was wondering if you have any Evangelion.
[356:01.06]Have you seen Evangelion?
[356:02.98]Because I know you have one anime a year, but if you haven't, it's a high recommendation.
[356:07.79]But anyways, love you, Jerma.
[356:08.69]Sorry for the weebin' out on me.
[356:12.05]I've seen... It's Neon Genesis Evangelion, right?
[356:15.03]Neon Genesis Evangelion.
[356:18.76]I think I've seen the entire show more than 10 times from start to finish.
[356:26.25]But I have no idea what happened.
[356:28.05]I don't even know one of the characters' names.
[356:30.27]Because my TV was permanently on in college.
[356:34.23]And that played every single night on Adult Swim.
[356:37.51]So it repeated.
[356:40.04]Every time they got to the end of the whole series, they would go back and do it again.
[356:43.42]So I've seen the whole thing probably a dozen times.
[356:47.09]I don't know who... I have no idea, though.
[356:52.31]Like, I couldn't tell you any character's name.
[356:57.81]But thank you, Eeps.
[356:59.15]Maybe I'll look into that.
[357:03.73]Hey, SirFeline, thanks for the $1.
[357:05.11]See, Jerma, classic meme.
[357:06.23]Like, Rick Rowling only gets better with age, like the French champagne.
[357:09.29]That's true.
[357:14.16]Yeah, I've seen the end.
[357:15.08]I've seen the end.
[357:15.54]Like, okay.
[357:16.24]Neon Genesis Evangelion.
[357:19.18]That's the anime where they're fighting these big robots.
[357:22.26]And then, like, the people have the shit come out of their forehead.
[357:24.08]And it's, like, a coming-of-age story about, like, puberty or something, right?
[357:26.74]And, like, then there's a guy that says, like... Yeah, I've seen it before.
[357:30.73]There's, like, a guitar.
[357:31.35]A person plays a guitar in it, right?
[357:45.71]I'm mixing Fooly Cooly.
[357:55.20]Isn't Fooly Cooly like four episodes?
[357:58.06]You know what I'm going to do?
[357:59.87]We're going to do another anime this year.
[358:02.27]I'm going to get four TVs and I'm going to play each episode of Fooly Cooly at the same time.
[358:07.21]And just absorb the whole thing.
[358:09.61]Like a security monitoring system.
[358:19.70]thanks a lot man hey thank you the doctor forever thanks for the one dollar please do the biggest deepest be out of your life I won't be able to right now my throat is a little uh worked right now so I can't really I have to have like a full night's sleep and drink a bunch of water and not be talking for like four or five six hours straight to be able to do it the ps4 is about to turn off it's about to enter rest mode let's see it in real time what do you think's gonna happen

[359:05.63]Do the smallest, highest BIA of your life.
[359:07.96]I can't do it.
[359:08.94]See me after class.
[359:10.88]Thank you, though, guys.
[359:12.37]Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[359:13.43]Jeremiah, I found another video that reminded me of you.
[359:16.89]Mute the stream because you never know what somebody's going to send you.
[359:20.55]It could be anything, even somebody that... What is this?
[359:28.02]Is the guy, like, just talking?
[359:29.04]Alright, send me after class.
[359:36.54]I'll watch it after class.
[359:39.32]Hydrate.
[359:39.80]No, no.
[359:45.44]thank you sir feeling I'll watch it after class hey GarfieldTheMondayKiller what are you doing with the third comic book you know what see me after class you're in big trouble no joking just take the bits Garfield save you it's actually this is pretty relevant so Jerma spider whap they don't call me the killer for nothing
[360:13.66]Save me after class, man.
[360:14.50]You're in big trouble.
[360:15.44]Hey, Brolock, thanks for the $1.
[360:16.82]Every month or so when I get up and go, I'll usually find a Huntsman spider.
[360:21.34]They're completely harmless, but they're huge.
[360:22.98]Look them up.
[360:23.90]See, Huntsman spiders don't scare me because once a spider gets big enough, right?
[360:28.54]When a spider gets large enough, it becomes a crab.
[360:33.58]And I'm not scared of a crab.
[360:36.56]Crabs are interesting.
[360:37.98]Huntsman spiders are huge.
[360:39.48]They're crabs.
[360:45.11]so there is this finite space and finite size between small to small but big enough where it's scary larger than that you got yourself a crab or a lobster and that doesn't scare me a tarantula does not scare me a little wolf spider it's you know the the elephant in the mouse right elephant scared of terrified of mice
[361:10.99]WHOA MY GOD, BOO!
[361:12.21]They make the whole tribe go crazy, right?
[361:15.33]Elephant versus, like, a lion.
[361:17.13]They're not scared of the lion.
[361:18.31]Why would they be?
[361:19.23]They fight the lion, and they win.
[361:20.62]It's gotta be small enough where it's... Here's the thing.
[361:33.93]I just figured out everybody's fear.
[361:35.49]I figured it out.
[361:37.37]I got it up here in my brain.
[361:39.88]The reason why you're scared of spiders, and why I am too.
[361:43.30]I'm not scared of them, but like, the reason why they're fucking losers.
[361:46.64]Yeah, they're a loser.
[361:47.94]I'm not scared of them.
[361:49.85]Is because when they're small enough to hide, and they get away from you, and they skitter across somewhere, and then you don't know where they are.
[361:58.17]A crab, a big Huntsman crab spider, is just there.
[362:03.18]And it's not a big deal, you always know where it is, you can keep tabs on it forever.
[362:10.74]It's not like, holy shit, something just skidded across my monitor.
[362:13.16]No, no, no.
[362:14.04]It's a crab just sitting there.
[362:15.22]And you're like, ah, get out of here, you fucking loser.
[362:22.57]What about a scorpion?
[362:23.27]Not scared of a scorpion either.
[362:25.93]Scorpion's a fucking loser.
[362:29.59]Just get a frog.
[362:30.50]You'll be fine.
[362:36.43]But thank you, bro.
[362:37.19]Thank you, Zazasalt, for the $1.
[362:38.77]Last night, someone in the Discord predicted this.
[362:40.47]I don't know what that is.
[362:55.34]That link don't work.
[362:59.21]But thank you, Zazasalt.
[363:00.31]Last night, someone in the Discord predicted that, and today you called caviar slug eggs.
[363:04.35]We know you too well.
[363:07.52]Oh, that's because there's an extra eye here.
[363:08.74]Hold on, let me see.
[363:12.09]You added an extra eye.
[363:14.69]I will fix it, and I will look at it.
[363:18.13]Right now.
[363:18.89]I swear to God.
[363:22.05]Dude, I swear to God, dude.
[363:26.08]Oh, you put a space in the link?
[363:29.00]I can't, like, get it.
[363:31.26]Streamlabs, what the hell?
[363:33.08]Why do you make it impossible to copy and paste something?
[363:37.75]I can't even like, yeah, Streamlabs is like a, for some reason.
[363:44.11]There it is, okay.
[363:48.21]Copy.
[363:48.51]I'll get it.
[363:51.73]ingrid.com slash that.
[363:57.25]That sounds like something Jerma would say, except you would forget what caviar is called.
[364:01.13]Ask chat by explaining it poorly, then ignore chat and call it something either too literal or entirely incorrect.
[364:09.73]I mean... I'm just too fast.
[364:16.34]I'm too fast for you guys.
[364:18.70]Thank you, Tiny Cactus, for the $1.
[364:20.12]I have an itch on my leg.
[364:21.14]Let me get it.
[364:23.32]Got it.
[364:24.18]Not anymore.
[364:26.16]Hey, Sir Feline, thanks for the $1.
[364:27.36]That reminds me.
[364:28.70]What charity did you donate the $100 to when you got the ninth seagull in a row?
[364:37.61]What charity did I donate to?
[364:42.15]Oh, right, right, right, right, right.
[364:43.39]At my local grocery store, I bought... They do a food drive.
[364:49.24]And I bought, like, 10 ticket stubs, which equaled 100... Like, it was 10 bucks a ticket stub.
[364:56.50]Local food pantry.
[364:58.99]In fact, that's usually what I do.
[365:08.20]He doesn't know.
[365:08.78]No, no, no.
[365:09.66]I gotta pull knowledge back from like a year ago.
[365:12.83]I distinctly remember doing that because it was like kind of... They were running the drive and you could do $10.
[365:18.39]So I was like, can you do that 10 times?
[365:22.62]And you get like the... They process like the ticket.
[365:26.30]It was at the grocery store.
[365:35.97]Is the stream over or not?
[365:37.15]I mean, technically, yeah.
[365:38.53]This is like the... The bear got out of the cage and he's just... The talking part.
[365:47.92]Ever thought about trying Mountain Blade of Warband?
[365:50.96]Single player is really fun.
[365:51.84]I actually popped into it...
[365:55.49]It was kind of over my head, to be honest with you.
[365:58.44]Seemed like a really interesting game, though.
[366:00.66]I did the tutorial where you block up, block left, block right, archery on the horse.
[366:06.26]And then I kind of got, there's like a weird overworld.
[366:10.66]I got, I don't know, it was weird.
[366:12.78]You walk around, you go to castles and shit.
[366:18.68]Anyways.
[366:20.09]Thank you.
[366:21.48]Like you spree all for the one dollar.
[366:23.00]It seems you didn't read this, but do you have a bucket list?
[366:25.74]And if so, what do is one of these things?
[366:30.50]What is one of those things?
[366:33.62]Um, I want, I want to piss in a volcano.
[366:41.57]That's it.
[366:44.97]Like get out of the top and go to Hawaii and just right into the center.
[366:58.38]Wouldn't that be cool, right?
[367:02.15]Somebody said it would evaporate immediately.
[367:03.73]Well, no.
[367:04.83]Whatever.
[367:05.29]I would piss in a jar up there and seal up the jar.
[367:09.01]Make sure the jar was in the freezer for an hour or two and bring the cooler with me.
[367:13.28]And then just grenade the piss down into the center.
[367:21.18]That seems a little safer.
[367:25.79]But that's it.
[367:27.95]guess I want to backpack across Europe no I don't sort of pee in a volcano uh but thanks man uh thank you snoozing copter for the one dollar while we're on the topic
[367:52.21]Uh, I hope you don't like bananas because you probably won't want to eat any after this.
[367:55.94]Also, watch out for the spider under your seat.
[367:58.42]What do you mean, don't eat bananas?
[368:00.28]Nah!
[368:16.35]If it didn't move like that, you guys are asking, like, what's wrong with the spider?
[368:20.19]You're crazy.
[368:20.85]Look at the way this thing moves its legs, like 200 fucking miles per hour.
[368:25.81]It just, like, skitters its fucking tiny little baby legs.
[368:32.51]If it didn't do that, I wouldn't be, I wouldn't call him a loser.
[368:36.95]Hold on, we got it.
[368:37.43]Come on, come on, come on.
[368:38.15]I don't want to miss it.
[368:41.65]Got it.
[368:43.14]Stream over.
[368:48.38]But thank you, Snooze and Copter.

[368:53.96]That's great.
[368:55.24]Hey, thank you, Ermine, for the $1.
[368:56.48]Ermine, some people have been bullying you with spiders.
[368:59.28]Thought you might feel better looking at this.
[369:03.35]I guarantee you this is like a spider eating somebody.
[369:09.09]Cutest rat eats spaghetti.
[369:11.21]Okay.
[369:12.59]Does a spider jump out and bite the rat's head?
[369:16.45]No, this is just a perfect video.
[369:19.90]Thank you for this, man.
[369:20.88]This is literally a perfect YouTube video.

[369:40.83]Look at him.
[369:46.01]Look at how perfect that is.
[369:49.38]He's like, I know, I almost fell down.

[370:23.96]What did I do?
[370:26.70]What did I do?

[374:14.00]As long as they don't touch me, they're not in the same room as me, they're not in my house, and they're miles away from me, they're great.
[374:29.81]You know, if they had like their own planet, right?
