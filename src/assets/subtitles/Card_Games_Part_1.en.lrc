[00:00.89]I hope it works.
[00:06.51]Because there's no way for me to tell.
[00:09.77]But hello, guys.
[00:10.48]How are you?
[00:11.12]I wonder what this looks like.
[00:25.03]But hello, guys.
[00:25.71]How are you?
[00:26.37]This is just taking up like the middle of the screen.
[00:32.08]I wonder what this looks like.
[00:33.76]Kind of.
[00:36.58]Hey, good morning, good afternoon, good evening, good evening is the real one here.
[00:40.85]Is it just taking up like the middle of the screen?
[00:45.00]So I cannot hear the game.
[00:47.98]I'm not going to be able to hear any audio because I got a splitter that goes into the headphone Jack and the headphone Jack goes into the splitter and the splitter goes to the capture device and the capture... I just ripped the damn cord out because I couldn't figure it out.
[01:01.91]So we're just going to play... I'm going to play... I know what... Don't worry.
[01:05.15]I know what this sounds.
[01:06.05]I know what they sound like.
[01:07.69]It's okay.
[01:08.27]I know the various...
[01:09.95]sound effects I just ripped the damn cord out because I couldn't figure it out so we're just gonna play oh there we go yeah actually that's probably a good idea iPad streaming
[01:38.92]I caught it let me plug in my actual headset here so let's talk about this for a second this particular video game that you see on your screen right now this is uh this is card crawl it's a thing I've been extremely addicted to recently it's extremely simple it's very good it's kind of like if you like hearthstone it's kind of like hearthstone
[02:09.27]And let's get this out of the way right off the bat.
[02:11.19]No, no, no.
[02:12.91]The card crawl guy didn't slip me a 20 to do this stream.
[02:16.70]I just like the game.
[02:17.62]It's a fun game.
[02:19.34]And I'm the iPad gamer.
[02:20.62]So trust the iPad gamer with his recommendations.
[02:26.16]How casual do you have to be to stream an iPad game?
[02:29.64]Pretty damn casual.
[02:31.06]So we're going to do it.
[02:33.14]I guess I can show you.
[02:34.87]Well, let me know if it's too loud because I'll have to fix that somehow.
[02:42.35]So if you take a look at the top of the screen, you get the big scary ox guy.
[02:49.27]And he deals out cards.
[02:51.45]There are 54 cards in the deck.
[02:53.85]And it's your goal to go through every single one.
[02:58.16]So I have to go through all 54 of these cards to beat the game.
[03:03.00]My character down there has 13 health.
[03:05.30]If you get to zero, you die.
[03:10.25]Pretty self-explanatory.
[03:11.95]See, there's monsters, there's potions.
[03:14.44]There's only like four different card types.
[03:18.24]So that's not a whole lot to the game, but it's very, very addictive, very fun, and I've been playing it in bed.
[03:24.20]So I'm going to try to just play and see if by me playing, you guys can figure it out.
[03:31.49]Please let me know because the game has a tendency to be kind of loud when you're getting hit by things.
[03:35.71]So let me know.
[03:38.33]So I can only equip two things.
[03:40.19]So my left hand and right hand.
[03:41.19]As you see here, I can pick up the shield.
[03:43.42]And it can go in my left hand or it can go in my right hand.
[03:45.62]Or it can go in my backpack.
[03:47.36]But for the purposes of that, I'm going to put this in my hand.
[03:49.74]Obviously because this will block damage and the damages of the two monsters up here.
[03:53.16]So you get a goblin and you get an incubus.
[03:56.35]Wasn't incubus a band, by the way?
[03:59.93]That was a band, right?
[04:02.22]Oh, anyways.
[04:03.48]So I can negate, obviously, the damage that this will do if I put him here, as you'll see.
[04:10.19]It negated the damage from the shield.
[04:12.47]The shield is now gone, but I lost two health.
[04:15.75]I got a potion up here that's worth eight.
[04:18.24]But, I mean, I'm not going to use that right now.
[04:21.46]That'd be stupid.
[04:22.68]I would overheal myself.
[04:24.44]It would be a waste.
[04:25.44]So we're going to put that in the... Oh, before I move this, I'll let you know.
[04:29.73]If I drag this potion, he'll deal out more cards when there are three open slots.
[04:36.72]So this dude's not going to do anything until I get rid of three cards.
[04:40.96]So I'm going to put this in my backpack.
[04:42.02]It doesn't get used.
[04:43.22]Here come three more cards.
[04:45.66]I got a troll.
[04:46.70]We got a troll.
[04:47.26]This is one of the harder enemies in the game.
[04:48.56]As you see, he's number nine.
[04:49.64]He's got nine health and nine damage.
[04:51.55]That's what it means.
[04:52.21]I'll just show you.
[04:53.81]I just took nine damage.
[04:56.29]If you eat their swords in the game, if I hit that guy with a sword, with like a four point sword, it takes his health and his damage down.
[05:05.38]So I just fucking ruined this whole thing, potentially.
[05:08.37]But maybe not, because I have a potion here.
[05:09.49]Let's go ahead and take it.
[05:12.25]And the whole point of this...
[05:14.70]is you're just trying you're just trying to get to the end and make as much money as you can see these coins I can put these in any one of these slots and it'll give me seven coins I'm gonna put it in the backpack because obviously I want the potion slot to still be there and see the seven down here I can't really like down the lower left here you see the seven
[05:36.21]You have to try to get as many coins.
[05:37.84]It's very hard to get more than like 75 or 80.
[05:41.26]That's where I've kind of topped out.
[05:42.44]I think my best, I've only gotten 92 or like 95, I think, is my highest.
[05:47.82]Maybe a little bit higher, but there's like the three minute explanation of what the game is.
[05:55.12]So let's go.
[05:56.15]Let's try to win.
[05:57.79]So obviously this guy, I kind of messed myself up there when I took the potion I wasn't supposed to or took the nine damage I wasn't supposed to.
[06:05.62]So we're going to take the seven damage and still deal up more cards and see what we get.
[06:11.39]I think this is on everything.
[06:12.33]I think this is on... Oh, by the way, I forgot about the fucking power cards.
[06:16.79]I can't forget these.
[06:18.27]So these have very specific things, like abilities.
[06:21.77]So if I put this on, you actually have to physically equip it.
[06:26.43]So it has to... I'm not going to do it right now because I don't want to use it right now.
[06:28.96]But you put it in one of your hands and you drag it over and it does whatever the text says.
[06:33.90]And this one is...
[06:36.02]if I die this when this is active I come back to life with one health so it's kind of like a like a guardian angel you revive if you die okay got a lot of potions a lot of coins I'm going to take the coins we're going to take the actually I'm going to take the 10 potion let's get back to full health and I'm going to put the revive here you don't have to use it just has to sit there so you can deal with more cards and we've got a spider
[07:02.08]By the way, you can also sell things, too.
[07:03.24]Like, I can go like this.
[07:04.16]I can drag this.
[07:04.80]See, this potion's worth six.
[07:06.62]I can give it to the cookie monster, and he'll give me six gold.
[07:11.82]So, you give and you take.
[07:12.96]You know what I mean?
[07:13.43]Like, if I... But I just lost a six-point potion, which could come back to really bite me on the ass very soon here.
[07:23.45]Play Grab That Auto for... No, I'm never playing those games again.
[07:29.65]I can't believe... What an iPad gamer.
[07:34.15]Yeah, let's see what you guys think about it.
[07:38.86]He could be talking about the history of Bohemia, and I would understand that more than what's going on the screen.
[07:44.22]You'll get it.
[07:45.22]Trust me, you'll get it.
[07:45.92]It's kind of weird at first, but after a few games, you'll understand what's going on.
[07:50.06]So, you know what?
[07:51.82]I'm going to take the coins.
[07:54.40]I'm going to have to take the... I guess I could sell this.
[07:58.12]Let's get three coins so he can deal up more cards.
[08:00.08]See, I don't have to take that A damage yet.
[08:02.78]Okay, I think I fucking lost.
[08:03.94]Yeah, I lost.
[08:04.52]Did I?
[08:06.53]I can revive.
[08:07.37]I can take my... So 10.
[08:08.45]Yeah, it's the game over.
[08:11.16]I can't negate that much damage.
[08:14.54]But you get the idea.
[08:16.42]Actually, wait a minute.
[08:17.00]Wait a minute.
[08:17.30]Wait a minute.
[08:18.02]No, I can go one more turn.
[08:21.12]Let's do this.
[08:23.84]Yeah.
[08:25.68]We're okay.
[08:26.46]Check it out.
[08:26.80]Ready?
[08:26.96]I'm going to take the revive.
[08:28.66]Get rid of the soul leader.
[08:31.50]I need a potion.
[08:32.06]Like a big one.
[08:34.34]Okay.
[08:34.64]Okay.
[08:36.45]That's not a big potion, but... Let's go ahead and take it anyways.
[08:41.99]Because then... That's five, six, seven, eight.
[08:46.01]No, that's game over.
[08:47.61]Because, see, I can't get rid of all these.
[08:50.73]So, as you saw, me selling those potions, me getting rid of it in the beginning, comes back and hurts you.
[08:58.15]The game, by the way, if you want it, is... I think it's like two or three dollars.
[09:02.19]And that's the end of the run, and he laughs at you.
[09:06.26]It's not nice.
[09:08.78]And it goes, hey, here's what you did.
[09:11.18]Why don't you go ahead and tweet that?
[09:14.00]So 92, I guess, was my best run so far.
[09:19.29]And you're really trying to get as much money as you can.
[09:23.77]You cannot sell the monster cards, unfortunately.
[09:26.27]The game would be very easy.
[09:29.20]But that's it.
[09:29.94]Like, that's the game.
[09:30.90]That's pretty much it.
[09:32.30]But it's turned into my nightly ritual these last couple of weeks.
[09:36.50]Or last week or so.
[09:42.86]I'm going to try to win a couple in a row here.
[09:45.56]Show you guys my true iPad gamer skills.
[09:48.46]Okay, well let's take the damage.
[09:56.96]And I'll take that.
[10:01.47]yeah wow this is a really good draw I guess I could sell some of these potions remember the goal is to make as much money as you can without dying you have to live I'll sell the yeah I'll sell the six bring the nine down here take the two damage and then heal it right back up and then he draws more cards
[10:26.77]This game isn't on Twitch, like I couldn't put it.
[10:28.57]It's just card crawl on the app stores.
[10:33.34]Ooh, this is interesting.
[10:34.30]So this is morph.
[10:35.84]This just turns any card into a random new card.
[10:39.50]Sounds like I should do that to the spider, mainly because it's an eight damage card.
[10:43.44]And now it's a two damage little locust.
[10:48.72]Now here's the thing.
[10:49.20]I could instantly just kill that with the sword.
[10:50.80]So the sword is I put it on and I can attack with it.
[10:53.98]And I don't take any damage.
[10:55.32]So here.
[10:56.00]So you can see.
[10:56.40]There you go.
[11:02.97]And I got a soul leader to deal with.
[11:04.71]A lot of potions though.
[11:05.77]So this is okay.
[11:07.67]I'm okay with just taking the damage here.
[11:09.45]I don't care.
[11:10.86]And I'll just heal it back up.
[11:15.60]Coins, coins.
[11:16.08]Coins, coins.
[11:19.02]Yeah, I'll take them both.
[11:22.04]See, now I can't put my potion down here.
[11:24.83]I have to wait until next turn.
[11:26.59]If you use a coin or you use a potion, you can't physically put anything down there until the next turn.
[11:36.13]Yeah, this is not like Hearthstone.
[11:38.54]This is more like I'm sitting on the bus and have like 15 minutes to kill.
[11:47.56]It's very fun.
[11:49.64]And I did say that this was going to be an iPad gamer stream, so... I could take the... Can I take the damage?
[11:58.44]I could sell the potion and take the two coins and see what I draw.
[12:01.62]We're going to do that.
[12:03.84]This is going to be very bad, but... Let's hope I get a sword.
[12:08.40]There we go.
[12:08.82]That's actually not the greatest thing, but it's enough to keep me alive.
[12:18.89]Take the coin and hope we get something good.
[12:22.86]That's good.
[12:23.72]It's a sword, but I don't know.
[12:25.54]Is it going to save me here?
[12:26.94]I have a nine potion.
[12:29.80]Don't be greedy.
[12:30.72]That's the whole point.
[12:31.52]The whole point is you've got to be greedy in this game because you unlock cards and you unlock characters based on money.
[12:38.81]So I can unlock a new dealer.
[12:40.27]There's like 15 cards I don't have that cost money and you get the money by playing the game and getting the money.
[12:51.55]It's free on Android?
[12:52.61]Is it really?
[12:55.41]That's, uh... That's pretty sick.
[12:58.65]If this is free on Android, legitimately, like, if that's real, go get it.
[13:02.36]Because there's no reason not to own this if it's free.
[13:07.34]Okay, so let's take... So this is what I was talking about before.
[13:10.54]So if I hit this spider... See, I have a six sword.
[13:12.86]He's an eight damage and eight health.
[13:15.77]Brings him down to two.
[13:16.99]Now he is a two health, two damage card.
[13:21.50]But I'm dead either way unless I take this.
[13:24.20]So now I'm going to take the two damage from the spider and I'll take the three damage from the crow.
[13:28.90]Give me more cards.
[13:29.75]Thank you very much.
[13:31.45]I believe I lost the game.
[13:32.99]Let's see.
[13:33.47]No, not quite.
[13:34.99]Put on both shields.
[13:37.09]I'll take one damage here.
[13:42.16]Ah, frenzy is useless to me right now because I don't have a weapon.
[13:45.64]This is you can attack twice with a weapon that you have equipped.
[13:50.82]It doesn't help at all.
[13:54.01]But if I sell this, if you sell an ability card, it just discards it.
[13:59.37]You don't get any money for it.
[14:00.31]Okay, what do I do here?
[14:03.63]I can live.
[14:06.45]I'll take three damage and be down to one.
[14:10.87]Yeah, I want to get the coins.
[14:12.53]Okay.
[14:17.18]Okay.
[14:20.79]This is interesting.
[14:28.21]Yeah, I blew it big time.
[14:30.93]That frenzy would have been real nice right now.
[14:35.31]I was trying to clear the board, though.
[14:37.81]Shit, that was bad.
[14:38.65]I should have held on to that.
[14:39.67]I shouldn't have discarded that.
[14:40.61]But, you know, sometimes you make these little mistakes.
[14:43.54]I'm okay, though.
[14:44.56]Because I can go like this.
[14:45.34]I can take him down.
[14:48.12]Walk him into that.
[14:49.18]I don't take any damage, and I still have two, and I have four here.
[14:51.62]Give me a potion.
[14:54.64]I still think I'm okay.
[14:57.74]Yes, I am.
[15:02.67]I need a potion.
[15:03.49]Please, give me a potion.
[15:06.08]Ooh, those are not potions, but this is the Hail Mary here.
[15:14.78]I gotta get to Lucky Shot.
[15:18.10]It removes up to two, one or two cards randomly from the top row here.
[15:24.59]So the perfect world here is I want to get rid of the sword, pocket the shield, put on Lucky Shot, and pray that it kills both or I lose the game.
[15:36.09]Let's go.
[15:37.21]Let's keep going.
[15:38.15]And there's a 10 potion right there.
[15:39.52]Wow, I lost.
[15:42.34]Right?
[15:42.78]Yeah, I did.
[15:44.28]I don't think I can take that much damage.
[15:50.78]Hmm, well, I can... Hold on, let me think about this.
[15:54.10]If I put the shield on and the 6 hits the 3, I'll go down to 1.
[16:00.81]I can live.
[16:04.43]Yep, I can live one more.
[16:07.74]I only have 10.
[16:08.40]He only has 10 cards left.
[16:12.34]I can still live.
[16:14.06]I can still live here.
[16:15.72]Come on.
[16:16.14]Give me a potion.
[16:17.42]Or give me a sword.
[16:18.26]Ooh, okay.
[16:20.67]Yeah.
[16:21.47]Yeah.
[16:24.41]Obviously, I get rid of this.
[16:27.51]Wait, or do I?
[16:30.17]Because Leech will give me three health.
[16:33.05]And Leech is... It does three damage to a monster and heals me for three.
[16:38.80]So that would put me at six.
[16:41.90]He's down to six.
[16:43.78]Hit him into the... Yeah, we're going to do that.
[16:47.75]So he's down to six.
[16:49.41]Whack him into this.
[16:50.41]Get rid of the six.
[16:51.17]I take two damage.
[16:53.09]Heal up.
[16:53.91]And hope that these next few cards are not going to kill me.
[16:56.73]Thank God.
[16:57.89]He only has one card left in his deck.
[17:01.10]Obviously put on the shield.
[17:04.72]Pocket the potion for now.
[17:06.93]Take the three damage and hope this next card is not a huge card.
[17:10.29]I win.
[17:11.89]There you have it.
[17:13.03]So now that he has no cards left, I need to think about, I just got to sell, right?
[17:18.51]So sell the sword for seven.
[17:20.51]Sell the potion in my inventory for seven.
[17:22.25]We are at 79.
[17:23.39]I can't sell this because it's in my hand, but the whole board, everything has to be cleared.
[17:29.21]so I I can't just be like okay here's no cards I win no yeah I have to get rid of every card on the top row and I did it and there it is 79. yeah yes it's fun I'm telling you you guys will like it you beat a non-human animal at cards great job
[17:55.03]So see on the top right here, I have 212 gold.
[17:58.15]That's from doing this.
[18:01.01]That was actually up there.
[18:01.69]That was up there in one of my better runs.
[18:04.58]Top 5, right?
[18:06.74]Yeah.
[18:07.26]75 here, so that's 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[18:10.16]That would be number 5, I guess.
[18:12.06]Right?
[18:14.10]This is called Card Crawl.
[18:15.48]It's on the App Store.
[18:16.58]It's on Android.
[18:17.58]And if it's free on Android, then holy shit.
[18:21.77]Get your download finger ready.
[18:24.63]Now, there's a couple other things you can do in the game that's not just what you can do.
[18:29.55]Now, there's a daily dungeon you can do to compete against other players worldwide.
[18:34.35]Or you can do Constructed, and Constructed really is not what you think it is.
[18:37.97]That was kind of the disappointment that I had.
[18:40.23]I thought Constructed was going to be... You just pick, like, the ability cards.
[18:46.09]It's not like, make a whole deck.
[18:48.36]You just pick from five of the ability cards and that's what they put in the normal decks, so.
[18:53.84]But do I have enough money to unlock any more cards?
[19:01.87]Jerma, do you make yourself sound less smart for Star's videos than your videos?
[19:09.35]Yeah, anytime Star puts on the camera, I'm just like, alright, let's take the idiot juice.
[19:17.08]Now, when I'm recording a video, usually I'm like all amped up and ready to go.
[19:22.52]Streaming, this is, I'm just, I'm just fucking hanging out, you know what I mean?
[19:26.72]I'm just chilling.
[19:29.86]I want to use these though, because these are all about the money.
[19:33.14]So Fortify, increase the card's value by five, so you can do that to a coin card.
[19:38.29]And then you can do trade too, this gives you, sell any non-monster card for ten gold.
[19:45.18]It's pretty fucking cool, dude.
[19:51.24]How do you stream with an iPad?
[19:52.22]Very carefully.
[19:58.69]Jeremy, say something incredibly smart that could make people realize you are a moron.
[20:03.89]Well, I mean, I kind of am a moron.
[20:05.59]Let's think about this for a second.
[20:10.12]No, I don't have anything smart to say.
[20:11.50]Shit.
[20:12.58]Shit.
[20:15.36]Transform a card into a random ability card.
[20:17.12]See, some of these are so good.
[20:19.68]Like, look at this one.
[20:20.22]Raise the player life by 5 if it exceeds 13.
[20:24.12]So if I go over my max, I raise my maximum health.
[20:27.24]Being able to raise your max health to 18, that's huge.
[20:32.04]But I don't have enough money.
[20:32.86]I need to play more games.
[20:41.45]So why not?
[20:41.89]We get to play another couple games.
[20:43.71]I'm not going to play this all night, don't worry.
[20:45.43]I have another game I'd like to play.
[20:47.47]It's actually one of my favorite iOS games ever.
[20:53.54]Let's do... The quests, look at these.
[20:55.34]These quests are hard.
[20:57.48]This shit is like impossible to do.
[21:01.02]So create a 20 gold coin card.
[21:04.70]Or win 10 games without using any ability cards.
[21:08.91]You know how hard that shit is to do?
[21:11.92]That's not easy.
[21:15.65]Coaster crazy.
[21:21.59]Kill a 20 monster?
[21:23.29]A 20 monster doesn't even exist.
[21:25.84]I would have to use that fortify ability like two times to make a monster 20.
[21:32.82]Or get a streak score.
[21:33.64]I don't even know what that means.
[21:36.12]Raise the player's life to 25 or win 10 games with more than 20 life.
[21:41.36]I guess I just have to unlock more of the ability cards.
[21:44.07]I really don't understand.
[21:44.89]I don't know.
[21:47.43]See, this is one.
[21:48.13]Like, win 10 games with more than 100 gold.
[21:50.01]I haven't even done that once.
[21:56.76]I gotta activate the trap card.
[21:59.60]If I get it, I think it's like a lot of money.
[22:03.00]But no, there's no in-app.
[22:04.52]This is one of those games where you spend the two or three dollars or whatever it is and that's it.
[22:09.42]There's no in-game currency or anything.
[22:14.16]Let's do another one.
[22:20.61]How do I get along so well with Star when he's such a relatable hardcore gamer and you're such a relatable casual gamer?
[22:26.67]Those are two opposite spectrums.
[22:28.03]Well, opposites attract.
[22:30.27]Don't you know?
[22:30.77]That's like the number one rule.
[22:32.23]Opposites attract.
[22:36.42]Come on, man.
[22:38.08]This is a bad starting hand.
[22:42.78]This is even worse.
[22:46.56]I don't want to take that damage.
[22:48.58]I'll use the sword.
[22:52.48]Sap is exactly what you would think it is.
[22:56.97]You know, you just sap.
[22:58.51]It's just like what you think.
[22:59.77]Goes back in the deck somewhere.
[23:02.69]Saves me a lot of bullshit.
[23:07.68]There apparently are in-app purchases in the Android version, which is why it's free.
[23:12.33]I guess that makes sense, though.
[23:14.21]I'm sure you can just buy it outright if you really wanted to.
[23:22.17]The sound from the game is all sorts of messed up.
[23:24.19]Is it really?
[23:25.25]How so?
[23:33.32]I'm trying to think of what to do here.
[23:36.18]Just do this.
[23:43.63]Did I screw up the sound somehow?
[23:46.40]Did I unplug something I shouldn't have unplugged?
[23:55.37]Whoops.
[23:56.15]I wasn't really paying attention to that one.
[23:59.37]I have to... See, when you make a mistake...
[24:05.77]I can sell this sword right now my only options are sell the sword for 6 or take 9 damage because I screwed up a little bit so I I really want the sword though we're doing it I don't want to take that damage right now especially it's over I lost
[24:35.43]I lose.
[24:35.75]But I can't take all this damage.
[24:40.35]Oh, yes I can.
[24:40.95]Holy shit.
[24:41.53]What the hell am I thinking?
[24:42.69]Wow, I took that potion too?
[24:43.97]My god, what an idiot.
[24:45.99]You're asking me about being smart?
[24:48.51]You just saw it right there.
[24:49.33]I just put cards in random directions.
[24:56.46]Take the damage like a man.
[24:59.02]Vanish should just... Actually, I should probably do vanish right now.
[25:03.76]No.
[25:04.08]No.
[25:07.15]No.
[25:09.67]It's... Ah, no.
[25:11.67]We're going the ballsy route.
[25:14.86]I have to get rid of that.
[25:16.08]This one shield has really just got to get out of here.
[25:19.74]Now I can heal and use the sword and I'm okay.
[25:23.04]I haven't lost yet.
[25:23.90]10 coins.
[25:33.14]So, here's the question, right?
[25:41.57]The sound becomes distorted when it gets a little louder?
[25:45.21]Yeah, I have no idea.
[25:48.11]I wish I could explain why that's happening.
[25:53.78]But this is the iPad.
[25:55.32]I've never streamed from an iPad before.
[25:57.64]Hopefully it's not too terrible or too annoying.
[26:04.59]See, this is good.
[26:05.47]This is cool to bash, but I don't like it, though.
[26:08.13]I never liked getting this card.
[26:10.89]Use an equipped shield as a weapon.
[26:12.27]Each attack loses the shield 5 durability.
[26:14.79]So if I put that on, I can use that 7 damage to hit him for 7.
[26:19.82]But it doesn't really matter anyways, because I'm going to take the damage anyways, because he's going to have to hit me for 3.
[26:24.90]I'm going to take 1 damage regardless, but you know what?
[26:27.38]Let's do it, because, you know, who cares, right?
[26:32.79]And then we'll go like this.
[26:39.33]Okay, I'm okay.
[26:41.15]Things are fine.
[26:48.41]How's Otto?
[26:48.89]He's great.
[26:51.77]He's sleeping right over here, actually.
[26:53.35]He's lying down.
[27:03.04]Okay, I can get rid of... Obviously put this sword on.
[27:07.52]That's without a doubt.
[27:10.95]I believe it's Amikrog, if you're wondering how to pronounce it.
[27:16.81]I'm going to do this because that potion doesn't become... I don't lose shit on it, so... But I have to take 7 damage, so now we're down to 4.
[27:26.12]Ooh, Betrayal.
[27:33.36]That's a good one.
[27:35.76]So this card...
[27:38.16]Force a monster to attack its neighbor cards.
[27:41.22]It's good.
[27:43.54]I kind of need to use it on the guy on the left because otherwise I lose.
[27:48.45]So it'll hit things to the left and right.
[27:50.81]And if I don't get a potion or... Oh, thank god.
[27:55.63]Thank god.
[27:58.77]Set four, five, six, seven.
[28:00.23]Okay, so this will be alright.
[28:01.91]I can take this damage.
[28:04.22]Take the potion.
[28:06.44]Load me up.
[28:14.69]I lose one health point with this, but it's not really another good option, I don't think.
[28:23.74]Five shield, two shield.
[28:25.88]I live to see another day getting down to less than five cards, too.
[28:31.02]Just hope it's not a bunch of huge minions.
[28:34.36]It's two huge minions, but this is great, because look at this reflect.
[28:38.00]Reflect the damage taken to a random dungeon card.
[28:40.31]So, put the shield in my backpack.
[28:41.97]Put on the reflect.
[28:43.23]And one of these guys is going to kill somebody right here.
[28:45.53]This is going to be great.
[28:46.87]See you later.
[28:47.89]What are the last three cards?
[28:53.58]I think I win.
[28:55.70]In fact, I think I can just sell everything because... Four.
[29:01.80]No, I can't.
[29:03.30]I have to take that potion.
[29:05.81]Because this is going to happen here.
[29:06.99]It's going to go whack.
[29:10.87]And then I can sell 10.
[29:14.51]Well, this will sell for more.
[29:15.47]So I can go like this.
[29:16.93]Hit him.
[29:18.68]So then I only take 7.
[29:19.66]And then we sell the other two.
[29:21.86]It was alright.
[29:24.20]68.
[29:24.22]That's not that good.
[29:29.24]That's alright.
[29:29.88]I mean, that's no 92.
[29:33.87]But whatever.
[29:37.97]Grab Theft Auto Made Here Night.
[29:40.70]Good.
[29:41.56]I'm glad.
[29:42.12]I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[29:44.14]That was a fun video to make.
[29:49.52]I have a whole slew of smack talk waiting for when you fail.
[29:53.08]I'm telling you, we're talking about iPad.
[29:58.47]You didn't think I was like an iPad professional gamer?
[30:03.89]This ain't like Mario Maker.
[30:06.61]This is my home turf.
[30:15.01]Yeah, the only way to get... You have to sell shit.
[30:18.83]But it's making the right decision to sell something when the next turn could just kill you because you sold a potion that would have saved your life.
[30:26.44]So, for instance, let's just sell a ton of shit.
[30:29.10]I'm just gonna sell shit and just take damage and just, like, hope I get, like, a good roll.
[30:33.97]Go ten coins.
[30:35.93]Sell the fucking shield, too.
[30:37.57]Three damage.
[30:41.40]Sell.
[30:42.02]Oh, fortify?
[30:42.90]You want me to fortify?
[30:44.04]Oh, add plus five to something?
[30:45.74]Thank you very much.
[30:46.78]Make it an eleven sword sell, the damn thing.
[30:52.26]Okay, now I need to be careful.
[30:56.87]Now I actually, I really have to be careful here.
[30:59.65]Because I just, I have four, I have 43 gold and I'm not even through 10, 15 cards yet.
[31:11.19]Okay, I'll take the four damage.
[31:16.15]This actually ain't going so bad.
[31:18.23]This is not going so bad at all, somehow.
[31:24.01]I'll take the five damage.
[31:26.17]Use the heal.
[31:29.13]Sell the five potion.
[31:30.88]Put the four one down.
[31:31.82]I'm gonna lose this.
[31:34.86]How have I not lost already?
[31:36.32]I don't know.
[31:43.09]Somehow I've stayed alive.
[31:46.37]That is such a... Look at that reflect.
[31:47.89]That is such a perfect reflect.
[31:50.95]Like, are you kidding me right now?
[31:53.19]Removing one of the ten damage cards?
[31:59.81]This is where I might be in a little bit of trouble here.
[32:04.35]Instant five.
[32:05.91]Take the five.
[32:07.29]Use the eight.
[32:08.05]Take the coins.
[32:11.81]I hope I win this one, too.
[32:17.29]Because, I mean, I'm probably going to have more than 100 for the first time.
[32:19.71]Put both swords on.
[32:24.65]Take the damage to the face.
[32:29.31]Oh, wow.
[32:31.49]Wow.
[32:32.83]I actually might actually win this.
[32:37.39]Hopefully, if I can turn this 10 into a 10 potion...
[32:42.35]Okay, I'll take that.
[32:43.31]That's a... I'll take that.
[32:44.57]That's good.
[32:45.95]That is fine by me.
[32:52.56]Everything but the mic sounds like Engineer with the Fly Head.
[33:01.02]How?
[33:01.88]How is that even possible?
[33:03.39]I don't even know what kind of audio problems would be happening to make that possible.
[33:20.80]I gotta sell something, huh?
[33:26.23]But I really have to think about this.
[33:27.21]I'm gonna get rid of the monster here.
[33:37.45]I'm gonna regret that.
[33:40.15]No more selling.
[33:40.89]No more selling.
[33:41.79]No more selling.
[33:44.90]Selling is over.
[33:46.58]Because I've gotten rid of so many cards that I need.
[33:56.54]See, this just takes... If your backpack is empty... See, I have the three shield down there.
[34:02.62]It'll put the top... The thing that's on the top of the deck will go into my backpack slot.
[34:06.24]I hate doing that, though.
[34:07.52]I hate this card.
[34:08.76]Because more often than... You get like a monster in there.
[34:11.25]And it's awful.
[34:20.66]I sold the shield.
[34:21.20]That was dumb.
[34:23.14]That was really dumb.
[34:23.96]I shouldn't have done that.
[34:25.74]Please don't give me a bad draw.
[34:29.73]It's okay.
[34:31.59]I can take it.
[34:33.27]I can take the damage here.
[34:35.87]Come on.
[34:41.63]Oh, no.
[34:42.03]I lose.
[34:46.20]Look at how much money I had, too, and it was still ten cards left.
[34:50.06]What'd I say?
[34:51.26]Why did I sell the shield?
[34:53.08]I would have been fine.
[34:55.24]Fuck.
[34:58.34]I'm addicted.
[34:59.86]I'm addicted.
[35:03.02]Let me see if I can figure out what the hell is going on here.
[35:05.72]I want to, like, listen to it.
[35:09.26]I'm curious as to what you guys are hearing.
[35:12.45]It's like times two speed.
[35:18.27]Why do I think that's funny?
[35:25.50]You never sell the shield?
[35:26.34]I know.
[35:28.46]Really shouldn't have sold that shield.
[35:34.39]At least they had the 83, but I don't get the 83.
[35:38.05]You have to win to get the money.
[35:49.17]Demon laugh.
[35:52.11]I want to hear this.
[35:53.23]Hold on.
[35:55.35]I want to hear him laugh.
[35:57.69]You're going to hear two of me for a second.
[35:59.31]Hold on a second.
[35:59.89]Demon laugh.
[36:09.70]I want to hear him laugh.
[36:13.60]Hold on a second.
[36:14.28]Demon laugh.
[36:23.43]What the hell is going on there?
[36:24.67]What the hell is that?
[36:25.77]Hold on a second.
[36:32.29]Let me see if I can just figure this out real quick.
[36:39.36]I wonder, I wonder.
[36:46.86]Yeah, it's like, it sounds like somebody's like crinkling up paper.
[36:56.27]Why is that happening?
[36:59.29]I'm gonna hold on just a second.
[37:00.99]Just a second.
[37:02.67]I'm gonna change my scene to whoops.
[37:11.76]Oh, no.
[37:12.64]Can you guys still hear me?
[37:18.19]Hold on.
[37:18.47]Yes, remove.
[37:21.33]Oh,
[37:25.41]Yeah, the iPad wasn't meant for this function.
[37:30.76]Okay, so that can stay like that.
[37:32.60]I'm going to load up the other game.
[37:35.56]I wonder what happens if I just rip the plug out.
[37:39.34]Okay, we're going to test this.
[37:40.50]I'm going to rip the plug out.
[37:42.94]I'm going to rip out the plug on the iPad.
[37:44.67]Here we go.
[37:45.77]This is going to happen.
[37:46.77]Who knows what's going to happen right now?
[37:47.85]Anything could happen.
[37:49.39]It's out.
[37:50.25]Are we still streaming?
[37:50.77]Okay.
[37:53.64]We are.
[37:54.08]Oh, that means I can do this, can't I?
[37:59.56]Wait a minute.
[38:02.07]Wait a second.
[38:05.01]Ooh, I'm getting a pretty good run here.
[38:08.13]Hold on a second, guys.
[38:11.89]Okay.
[38:14.57]This one is the best one I've ever done.
[38:16.89]This is by far the best one I've ever done.
[38:20.37]Wow, that's like 25,000 coins.
[38:23.66]Swap that one.
[38:24.80]Put this here.
[38:26.70]Okay.
[38:27.98]I got it.
[38:28.32]I wish you guys could see this one.
[38:37.49]That's what it's supposed to sound like.
[38:38.67]So, I don't know.
[38:42.93]I don't know what the hell this is.
[38:45.45]My iPad stream thing.
[38:51.42]I don't know.
[38:52.68]I'm going to try again.
[38:56.90]You know what?
[38:57.42]I think I can figure this out.
[39:02.28]We're going to figure this out right now, guys.
[39:04.96]Live.
[39:06.64]Live on stream, I'm going to figure this out.
[39:12.52]So bear with me.
[39:15.70]I think I know what happened and I'm going to correct the issue.
[39:25.83]Oh, would you look at that?
[39:27.59]Would you look at that?
[39:28.70]I think I figured it out.
[39:33.36]Hope so.
[39:36.04]Because if not, then, you know.
[39:42.37]Plugging it back in.
[39:44.01]We're now plugged in.
[39:46.87]Let's just do a little bit of a test here.
[39:48.13]I'm off camera doing a test.
[39:52.39]see okay that didn't fit in fact now it's all the colors are all messed up it looks like a Game Boy game okay hold on I want to turn this on I want to turn my Game Boy stream on I have no idea what's going on I have no idea what happened I broke something but we're going to play the Game Boy version of this game here we go this person needs to just get rid of this see you later
[40:24.00]I hope that doesn't keep happening.
[40:27.70]My fucking iPad stream.
[40:29.98]This was supposed to be smooth.
[40:33.54]God damn it.
[40:37.31]Is that a bitch?
[40:45.83]Fuck.
[40:46.75]Okay.
[40:47.95]We should be back.
[40:49.65]We should be back and... Let's see.
[40:53.03]Replay.
[40:55.30]Now, I don't think we have any sound at all.
[40:58.52]Why did I rip the cord out?
[41:01.78]I shouldn't have ripped out that cord.
[41:07.77]I shouldn't have ripped the cord out.
[41:14.51]This is what happens when you rip out cords.
[41:16.35]Seriously, what was I thinking?
[41:17.31]Let me rip this cord out.
[41:18.45]What an idiot.
[41:22.19]Sound is now gone.
[41:23.09]I would much rather have, like, the weird demon gurgly sounds than nothing at all.
[41:28.17]Hold on.
[41:35.23]Click this button.
[41:39.79]Whoa.
[41:40.85]Oh, boy, no.
[41:41.41]I didn't want to do that.
[41:44.81]I hope I didn't just do it.
[41:46.05]No.
[41:46.23]Oh, no.
[41:50.03]Am I still here?
[41:55.36]I think I am still here.
[41:57.20]Do we have sound?
[41:59.86]Shit.
[42:00.14]Alright, I might have to postpone iPad stream until I figure out we're going to play a different game.
[42:13.45]I pressed the big red button.
[42:15.59]It was my mistake.
[42:18.43]You never press the big red button.
[42:23.72]Try it one more time.
[42:26.76]Come on.
[42:27.28]I want to play my iPad game.
[42:36.24]Shit.
[42:43.65]I pulled it out again.
[42:44.89]We're going to plug it out and put it in.
[42:47.65]Format not supported.
[42:48.93]What the hell is going on?
[43:00.88]Alright, let's... Okay.
[43:03.50]I broke it.
[43:05.74]I broke the damn thing.
[43:11.99]Well, at least we got to play a little bit of that.
[43:14.19]I'm going to change games.
[43:17.19]I'm changing games.
[43:20.45]I'm going to remove this scene.
[43:22.57]Because it obviously isn't working.
[43:29.46]Oh, wait.
[43:29.78]Hold on.
[43:32.41]No, and the framerate is just awful, too.
[43:35.47]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[43:37.27]What the hell is going on?
[43:38.21]What am I doing here?
[43:38.75]What is this?
[43:42.24]Okay.
[43:44.06]That should fix the framerate problem.
[43:46.06]No.
[43:46.18]Alright, I'm going to load up a game you all know.
[43:53.54]It's a game you all know and love.
[43:56.93]The iPad stream worked for about 30 or 40 minutes.
[44:00.90]Hey, so at least you guys get to see that game, because that game's really, really cool.
[44:03.90]I, like, severely enjoy that game.
[44:06.68]So, at least it was that.
[44:14.78]Just keep your cool.
[44:16.10]There's no reason to flip out about something like that.
[44:20.02]You just gotta adapt.
[44:20.94]You gotta adapt to the situation.
[44:22.12]What are we gonna do?
[44:23.40]Adapt to the situation.
[44:24.96]What would a streamer do?
[44:25.82]If you were a real streamer, what would you do?
[44:29.05]You would adapt, and you'd find a new game to play.
[44:32.33]That's what we're gonna do.
[44:38.31]You know, I could actually pull up, uh... Yeah, we're gonna do that.
[44:43.35]That sounds like fun.
[44:56.15]Come on.
[44:57.07]What's going on with my internet?
[45:05.45]Um... What the hell is going on?
[45:09.09]My whole computer is locked up now.
[45:10.96]Fucking iPad.
[45:13.54]Pull the cord out and all of a sudden my computer doesn't understand what to do.
[45:19.44]Play Solitaire.
[45:20.06]That'd be funny.
[45:23.04]Um...
