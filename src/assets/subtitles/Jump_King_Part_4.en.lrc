[01:04.20]Let me open up my Steam.
[01:07.76]I'm also kind of developing a migraine right now.
[01:10.75]And I don't know if it's because of this dream I had last night.
[01:19.32]Or, I gotta, first of all, actually, let's get on campus.
[01:22.76]Let me just turn my webcam back on.
[01:25.04]This dream I had last night was fucking ridiculous.
[01:29.33]It was insane.
[01:31.97]It's probably the most ridiculous dream I've ever had in my whole life.
[01:38.47]But, let's tell, I want to talk to you about it.
[01:44.59]And then maybe... I have Katana Zero.
[01:48.13]Is Katana Zero a super-duper insane fast-paced headache game?
[01:55.74]Yeah, it is.
[01:56.30]Okay.
[02:00.54]Watch me just open up Jump King.
[02:02.04]Jump King is also a headache game.
[02:05.21]I'm definitely going to play that soon.
[02:06.39]But hold on.
[02:06.83]Let me get this back on stream here.
[02:12.31]That's not in the right spot.
[02:16.17]is my bomb guide so I had this dream last night and I'm gonna do my best to explain this people are gonna think that there's something wrong with me that probably is so I
[02:36.45]You know when you have a dream that just everything is so connected and it just goes from bullet to bullet to bullet point to bullet point really fast and it's as if you've been sleeping for like fucking six hours.
[02:45.46]Like you've been dreaming for six hours.
[02:49.86]But it's actually in reality only been probably like 14 seconds.
[02:57.98]So I had this dream.
[03:00.32]I actually wrote this dream down because it was so fucked up.
[03:03.58]I had to just rip off my iPad and just start typing.
[03:07.08]So I'm sitting, I'm sitting on a beach, right?
[03:13.11]I'm on a beach and there is a beautiful, beautiful beach and a huge mansion.
[03:17.63]I live in a huge mansion apparently for some reason, right?
[03:21.78]and it's a it's like at least a 10 to 20 million dollar house this place is fucking huge and underneath there is this tunnel underneath the house it's a big tunnel huge huge huge that you could like a like a dozen cars could fit into more than that so I'm sitting there and I don't know why this big tunnel is under the house it just is so I'm swimming in this beach with this amazing beach house
[03:50.08]And all of a sudden I look up and a fucking, an airplane, like a jet, a jet is just screaming by.
[03:57.89]And it's just like, and I'm like, that's getting kind of close.
[04:01.99]That's fucked up.
[04:02.61]Why is it getting so close?
[04:04.47]This shit goes under my house, way too close into the tunnel.
[04:09.11]It flies into the tunnel.
[04:11.51]And I go, holy fuck, this is ridiculous.
[04:14.07]I have to do something.
[04:16.15]This is ridiculous.
[04:17.43]My house.
[04:19.03]And I go under the water.
[04:20.74]Because I was like, it's going to be so loud.
[04:22.12]And I plug my fucking ears.
[04:23.88]And I just hear.
[04:24.64]And I'm under the fucking water going like.
[04:31.59]I open my eyes and I can see dirt and debris like coming into the fucking water and shit.
[04:35.89]And I'm like avoiding it.
[04:37.07]And I get out of the water and I go, what the, what happened?
[04:40.83]And by the way, everything is normal.
[04:43.75]There's no, there's no like wreckage or anything.
[04:46.43]It's just, my house is perfectly fine.
[04:48.73]The house is completely fine.
[04:50.23]So I walk, I'm like running to the house and my sister and my fucking mother are in the house.
[04:57.95]And they're freaking out.
[04:59.69]They're going, what the hell was that?
[05:01.14]Yeah, that was a jet.
[05:01.88]I don't know what that was.
[05:02.86]Like somebody, there was like a jet that just flew into the tunnel and it like exploded.
[05:07.04]And I'm like, yeah, that's what the hell I got.
[05:08.66]We got to figure out what to do.
[05:10.14]And I'm running by and there's, I have a big window right here, right?
[05:13.95]Huge window.
[05:15.57]Out the window, I go, hold on, what's that?
[05:18.51]And I look out and there's like three, it's my neighbor's yard.
[05:22.87]And they're like two or three little dogs.
[05:25.73]little puppies, like little tiny little dogs.
[05:28.81]And I'm going, oh, that's right, that's the neighbor's dogs, the little dogs.
[05:32.53]And over perching on the fucking guy's wall is a tiger, a huge tiger.
[05:40.60]And I'm looking over going, no, no, no, no, no, they're gonna, they're gonna kill, he's gonna kill, he's gonna kill those dogs.
[05:47.59]And my sister just goes, yeah, he's probably feeding right now.
[05:53.47]And I'm just like, this is really bad.
[05:54.81]What do we do?
[05:55.45]We have to do something.
[05:56.84]We opened up the sliding window, and I screamed.
[06:00.44]I went like, fuck, get out of here!
[06:02.43]And he freaked out, and he ran away for a second.
[06:05.68]And then my mother comes over, God bless her, right?
[06:08.80]My mother comes over and like, it's like, okay, he got away.
[06:12.80]Let's close the window.
[06:14.43]And as she's moving the window with her hands, it comes out of the frame.
[06:18.59]And it's just, she's got it in her hands and she's like, oh, the frame came out of the window.
[06:22.71]And the tiger comes back.
[06:24.78]The tiger comes back and he like fucking looks right in the eyes through the window.
[06:28.86]Through the window that's now open because my mother took the fucking whole frame off.
[06:32.68]And I freaked the fuck out.
[06:35.02]I'm like, mom, give me the fucking frame.
[06:36.95]Give me the fucking frame.
[06:38.59]We like stick it on.
[06:39.37]The tiger's fucking like walking towards the god, like getting really too close.
[06:43.73]And we get the fucking thing, click it in.
[06:46.90]And the tiger's still fucking there.
[06:48.26]We just barely did it, right?
[06:50.88]Right after that, I go, I gotta, I don't know what the fuck to do.
[06:53.38]I don't know what to do.
[06:54.00]There's so much crazy shit going on.
[06:55.68]I gotta go get a weapon.
[06:56.97]So I fucking ran into what was my huge like mansion living room and I grabbed a pair of shears.
[07:03.87]Okay.
[07:04.19]So I grab a pair of shears and I flip them upside down to hold.
[07:08.68]So the rubber ends, I was going to like whack them with the, with the other end.
[07:14.95]So I'm like, I'm going to go out there and like, get out of here.
[07:17.67]So, all right.
[07:18.39]I get that.
[07:19.84]I flip it around.
[07:21.06]I'm going outside.
[07:22.14]I hear somebody getting mauled outside.
[07:25.90]Like, I'm like, someone's getting fucking mauled out there.
[07:30.52]So I like go outside.
[07:32.08]I'm like, what the fuck happened?
[07:33.66]Somebody's getting fucking mauled.
[07:35.08]So I'm out there and the tiger's not there anymore.
[07:37.98]But this guy is, and I don't know if he was supposed to be my neighbor or I have no idea.
[07:42.09]He was just sitting there and he was like,
[07:44.53]blood everywhere.
[07:45.93]And he's just like, you gotta take me to the hospital, man.
[07:50.19]And I'm like, fuck, I don't know what to do.
[07:52.31]I'm like, stay right there.
[07:53.57]Just don't move, don't move, don't move.
[07:54.59]And I fucking turned around.
[07:55.43]I'm like, I don't know what to do.
[07:56.17]And I ran back in the house for a second.
[07:57.57]I was like, what do you call the police?
[07:58.99]And he goes, dude, you fucking serious, bro?
[08:02.87]I was like, I'm just trying to, I'm like, all right, let's, let's get you to the fucking hospital.
[08:07.56]All right, let's get, I dropped my fucking thing.
[08:08.96]And I'm like, let's go, let's go to the hospital to get in my car.
[08:12.02]And he goes, all right, sure.
[08:13.44]And he gets up and he's like normal.
[08:15.04]And he's like running.
[08:15.76]And he goes, wait, wait, hold on a second.
[08:17.34]I can't go anywhere without my cigarettes.
[08:19.68]And he like went back to where he got mauled in the first place.
[08:24.46]And like grabbed the cigarettes.
[08:26.26]And then we ran out.
[08:28.14]And the last thing that I saw before I woke up was this fucking guy putting a new cigarette in his mouth.
[08:34.54]And we're running down the stairs and he's lighting it in the house.
[08:37.64]And the thing that I, out of all the crazy shit that happened, the thing that I was most concerned about right now was, you don't fucking, you're smoking in my house.
[08:46.28]You don't smoke in my house.
[08:48.10]And then I woke up.
[08:53.29]Like, you're smoking in my fucking house, dude?
[08:55.13]Like, kind of weird.
[08:56.75]Kind of like, you think you can just do that?
[08:59.84]That was, uh... It was insane.
[09:07.74]And every single part of it was so intense.
[09:11.53]Everything I just described to you, each one of those three different scenes, was like living inside of a movie.
[09:16.93]In three different occasions.
[09:20.82]Ugh.
[09:24.32]And I don't even know what that means.
[09:26.64]I don't even know what that's supposed to mean.
[09:31.61]But that was a wild one.
[09:33.45]It's been a while since I've had a dream like that.
[09:35.77]Anyways, I just had to vent that out because that was seriously fucking ridiculous.
[09:40.95]Anyways, we are going to do today... You know what?
[09:45.11]Let's just... Oh, wait.
[09:50.40]There's another one.
[09:54.36]What the fuck is this?
[10:15.46]Jesus Christ.
[10:18.46]Oh.
[10:23.64]It's real.
[10:24.32]I mean, it is a real image, but not... It's doctored real.
[10:28.49]And then, of course, there's... Uh...
[10:47.49]Alright, what do I want to do?
[10:49.03]I'm like, I don't even know what I want to do.
[10:51.15]I want to like play Jump King, but I'm not sure I have what it takes right now.
[10:54.99]I have what it takes last night.
[11:03.16]Go back to the coin game.
[11:10.28]No, AI dungeon is not going to work.
[11:11.68]It's going to take too long to set up.
[11:12.92]Alright, I'll get a pole in here.
[11:19.47]I'll put a pole down.
[11:20.17]Why not?
[11:25.23]Play Neopets.
[11:26.09]All right, let's do... This is what I would do right now.
[11:38.40]Put that one on there.
[11:42.09]Put that one on there.
[11:43.09]I need a third option, too.
[11:45.39]How about...
[11:50.49]No, no Drew Crew.
[11:51.79]Not today.
[11:53.87]What else can I put on this list?
[12:01.91]Oh, this game looks like kind of cool.
[12:03.45]It's another cute game.
[12:04.35]All right.
[12:12.36]What do you want to do?
[12:15.26]What do you want to do?
[12:31.73]It's a funny face stream.
[12:33.17]Oh yeah, that image is still just on there.
[12:34.93]You're right.
[12:40.88]Well... I'm gonna play Katana.
[12:46.86]Katano?
[12:47.54]Katana Zero.
[12:49.32]Maybe just not tonight.
[12:52.78]Katana Zero is something that I'm going to do.
[12:57.78]Give us the king.
[12:59.26]Give us the king.
[12:59.94]I mean, it looks like people, the majority want to see some jump king.
[13:05.89]I can't just like turn my brain off and let that just happen and like just go.
[13:11.03]As long as, like I said, I've developed a fucking migraine.
[13:15.81]So.
[13:18.99]It's got to be something that's easy for my brain to understand.
[13:25.37]All right.
[13:25.73]I'm going to close this.
[13:30.84]Jump King, nice streamer bait game.
[13:33.56]Hey, I played Jump King like two weeks ago, three weeks ago.
[13:36.34]I played it.
[13:38.92]I couldn't see any of the subs that came in.
[13:40.72]We did have a couple of big ones come in.
[13:42.99]Friend.
[13:49.50]A friend pal buddy gave 5,000 bits earlier.
[13:52.20]Thank you, friend.
[13:53.80]Thanks for the 50 fucking dollars.
[13:55.08]They say bugleberry pottery was definitely the worst joke of the year, but it was also the funniest shit.
[13:59.41]I also lap my ass over you taking pottery lessons for it.
[14:02.45]Watched and loved the content for eight years.
[14:04.29]Keep doing you.
[14:07.31]Here comes the jet from the dream.
[14:08.91]All right, let's do some Jump King.
[14:15.38]We'll just chill for a little bit.
[14:21.00]I'm just gonna open it but thank you friend pal buddy we also had 10 community subs from fluid mesic right now thank you fluid mesic and I think that's it for now because I couldn't see it put on some chill music ai dungeon doesn't need setup I don't want to do that beta website one it's not as interesting as the one from collab
[14:45.68]Jump King is the opposite of chill.
[14:47.06]Well, I'm not going to take it seriously.
[14:49.59]I'm not going to take it seriously.
[14:50.43]We're just going to play it and relax.

[23:57.60]I don't feel like a pizza right now, so you can't grab me.
[24:07.87]Ah, fuck.
[24:08.55]I think I lost it from last night.
[24:14.05]Yeah.
[24:16.75]Yeah, it looks... I don't know if it's gonna... Yeah.
[24:20.15]Yeah, it's lost from last night.
[24:21.93]Yeah, I lost it.
[24:24.52]Fucking my headache's getting so much worse.
[24:27.32]Like, why can't I just replace my brain with, like, a digital fucking computer at this point?
[24:33.06]Like, why?
[24:37.48]Everyone wants self-driving cars.
[24:39.12]No, I want a self-driving brain.
[24:40.66]Okay.
[24:50.50]We're good.
[24:54.57]What?
[24:55.69]Digital computer, lol.
[24:58.61]Yeah, I want a digital computer brain.
[25:04.09]It's on its way.
[25:09.64]Shit.
[25:12.08]Okay, come on.
[25:13.24]Get me back up to there.
[25:17.74]Too much.
[25:18.44]Way too fucking much.
[25:19.72]That's a tiny jump.
[25:29.71]Forced updates.
[25:32.09]Yeah, I'd rather have like a digitized brain.
[25:34.30]Okay, that's better.
[25:40.39]Don't go too hard.
[25:43.95]Alright.
[25:45.23]Slowly but surely climbing back up to where I was.
[25:47.67]I don't know why I'm here.
[25:54.56]Just jump over the hole.
[25:55.28]Just jump over it.
[26:03.91]Fuck.
[26:09.45]Damn it.
[26:11.31]I'm telling you, it's those 5G signals.
[26:19.11]I also have a doctor's appointment tomorrow, too.
[26:21.60]I'm bringing this shit up.
[26:33.93]No, no, not the digitized computer brain.
[26:39.90]I hate talk.
[26:41.31]I've got something to tell you.
[26:42.59]You know, like, when are we going to have medical procedures where I can replace my brain with a computer?
[26:52.34]That's not what I'm talking about.
[26:57.76]Alright, back up.
[26:58.46]Here we go.
[27:09.60]Oh yeah, okay.
[27:14.35]Okay.
[27:18.67]Hope it goes well.
[27:19.47]Me too.
[27:20.65]Me too.
[27:21.01]Okay, easy does it.
[27:35.48]Easy does it.
[27:36.12]Oh.
[27:36.60]Oh.
[27:39.06]I've made it back.
[27:39.88]Well, not yet.
[27:50.47]Okay.
[27:51.23]Good.
[27:52.77]Same deal.
[27:53.27]Get back up here.
[27:58.95]Oh.
[27:59.57]Come on, man.
[28:02.35]Sorry to hear that you're being put down tomorrow.
[28:08.65]If anything I can say about this dream, I'm so glad I got to tell you about that dream.
[28:15.48]Seriously.
[28:16.64]I'm so glad you guys got to hear it.
[28:28.57]Too much.
[28:28.93]Oops.
[28:32.69]Okay.
[28:34.13]Alright, I made it back.
[28:40.25]A little too much, but it's alright.
[28:43.19]Ooh, I almost didn't make it.
[28:45.55]Oh!
[28:45.99]Way too fucking much.
[28:47.63]Way too much.
[29:01.72]Shit.
[29:02.72]This is bad.
[29:04.92]What do I do about this?
[29:05.56]Oh, fuck.
[29:10.33]There we go.
[29:16.24]Come on, man.
[29:16.86]What the fuck was that?
[29:27.19]Alright.
[29:27.57]Get on there.
[29:31.13]Please, I'm begging you.
[29:32.05]It's so easy.
[29:32.75]No, no, no.
[29:33.43]I'll fall all the way down.
[29:34.18]I don't want to fall all the way down.
[29:42.90]Holy fuck.
[29:46.18]Alright, now we go this way.
[29:47.34]I'm ready.
[29:47.66]Here we go.
[29:48.10]That jump is fucking insane.
[30:08.28]But, alright.
[30:09.14]If I go...
[30:11.28]If I go left instead, can I make that with a full jump?
[30:17.20]I'm not sure I can.
[30:17.99]Can I?
[30:21.07]No, I have to get this one, right?
[30:27.29]Oh man, that sucks.
[30:29.47]That's so hard.
[30:30.99]That jump sucks.
[30:44.28]Jump King sucks.
[30:57.11]Okay, so I've overshot that jump two times, right?
[31:01.18]So it's lighter than that, but fuck, man.
[31:03.78]It's so hard to judge.
[31:20.76]Maybe before this is a 12-hour stream.
[31:22.48]No, no way.
[31:37.03]Not a chance.
[31:37.55]Alright, here we go.
[31:42.27]Got it.
[31:44.29]Okay.
[31:47.09]Boys and girls, we've made it to this next section.
[31:57.08]Alright, now what?
[32:00.60]What?
[32:01.57]Over, wait.
[32:03.83]Over there?
[32:06.47]Okay.
[32:07.47]Underberg.
[32:08.57]There's wind now.
[32:09.59]Oh god.
[32:12.25]There's wind.
[32:13.65]Shit.
[32:17.01]Hmm.
[32:18.35]It's not that strong though, is it?
[32:24.25]I wonder, can I, should I jump from all the way to the left?
[32:28.43]With the wind?
[32:33.56]I'm scared.
[32:34.02]Okay.
[32:41.06]I think I can just jump up and it'll take me, right?
[32:42.78]Alright, yeah.
[32:46.60]I didn't know how strong it was.
[32:54.44]Oh my god.
[32:58.02]This sucks.
[32:59.36]This sucks.
[33:00.98]Oh man.
[33:01.67]Okay, slow down.
[33:02.49]I could jump up a little, but then, guys, I have to... All the way to the left is not safe.
[33:24.99]What the fuck was I thinking?
[33:38.24]Shit.
[33:42.86]Now I'm back here again.
[33:44.56]Damn it!
[33:45.44]It's okay.
[33:54.05]Ugh.
[34:14.48]All the way over.
[34:18.92]Come on, really?
[34:19.56]Alright.
[34:30.27]No!
[34:30.57]Oh, god!
[34:33.49]It's so hard!
[34:34.77]No!
[34:36.59]It's so hard and if you fall, you're fucked!
[34:57.58]It's the anxiety of being so scared that you're gonna miss it and go all the way down.
[35:06.00]Fuck.
[35:17.31]Ayayaya, let's go.
[35:23.16]Oh shit.
[35:25.64]Oh shit.
[35:27.36]Um... Uh... Okay.
[35:37.53]Fuck!
[35:37.83]I was on it!
[35:38.37]What the fuck just happened?
[35:39.27]Slow down.
[35:40.53]I thought I missed it.
[35:41.15]Okay, we're good.
[35:48.05]Let's go.
[35:53.79]Okay.
[35:58.72]Let me get up here and see what the hell this even is all about.
[36:04.61]Alright, let's get... Okay.
[36:09.97]Um... Yeah... Full jump to the left into the wind?
[36:20.82]Or full jump to the left with the wind?
[36:22.54]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[36:24.32]Full left with the wind?
[36:27.92]I'm gonna soar over this.
[36:29.12]Hopefully this isn't up top, maybe?
[36:30.34]Ahhhh.
[36:41.90]Oh!
[36:45.02]Uh oh.
[36:52.14]Shit.
[36:54.06]Okay.
[37:02.50]Don't, Jeremy.
[37:04.10]Oh my god, I hate this part.
[37:07.27]It's freaking me the fuck out.
[37:15.69]Jump King and chill.
[37:16.81]Jump King and increase headache.
[37:22.88]Why would you tell me to do that?
[37:29.79]That was a full jump left.
[37:37.27]Can you see the wall?
[37:38.61]What do you... What do you mean the wall?
[37:42.34]Yeah, I... I'm scared to do a full jump left.
[37:46.40]I'm gonna soar over the whole damn thing.
[37:53.85]Alright, I'm going for it.
[37:55.43]Yeah, I know.
[37:56.05]I can see the pole I'm just talking about.
[37:57.45]If I do a full left, I'm going to soar the fuck over the whole thing.
[38:06.39]Fucking wind, I swear to God.
[38:07.61]Alright, here we go.
[38:25.36]Oh, my fucking god, guys.
[38:27.82]No, it didn't work.
[38:46.98]Oh, fuck.
[38:50.74]Oh, fuck.
[38:59.79]Let's go.
[39:00.37]Get back up there.
[39:07.80]Alright.
[39:12.10]You gotta go softer than that.
[39:13.54]Very soft.
[39:14.66]Not very soft, but... Shit.
[39:31.30]Okay.
[39:31.70]Alright.
[39:32.06]Alright.
[39:32.36]Alright.
[39:32.62]Alright.
[39:32.95]Alright.
[39:33.19]What's up here?
[39:34.73]I'm scared to jump up there.
[39:36.75]Fold to the right.
[39:37.89]With the wind.
[39:40.51]Fold right with wind.
[39:44.88]I don't have time to jump.
[39:47.08]And check.
[39:50.34]I had to check.
[39:51.62]I had to check, man.
[39:52.92]I don't know what's up there.
[40:07.14]I couldn't... I didn't even see what was up there either.
[40:10.62]God damn it.
[40:25.02]I'm going for it.
[40:25.44]I'm just jumping up with the wind.
[40:29.46]Holy shit.
[40:30.14]Okay, I was supposed to do that.
[40:31.66]Alright, now...
[40:35.62]Oh, fuck.
[40:36.26]Alright, now... Um... Okay.
[40:42.36]There's two ways to go.
[40:43.34]I could try right... Or just... I don't know.
[40:54.47]Oh my goddammit.
[40:55.41]Fucking Jesus Christ.
[40:56.97]I just... I didn't... Ugh.

[41:12.15]What the fuck?
[41:14.17]Are you serious?

[41:20.10]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[41:23.86]What?
[41:26.16]It was plugged in the whole time.
[41:31.79]That's so stupid.
[41:42.19]Fall right with the wind.
[41:55.84]I can't fucking believe that shit.
[41:59.64]Holy fuck, dude.
[42:00.76]Okay, if you stand still, the wind doesn't- Ow, my head.
[42:02.70]Okay.
[42:22.49]Wait, I'm... Oh, I'm inside of a building.
[42:26.27]I'm inside of a building.
[42:27.35]Okay, I'm inside of a building.
[42:28.53]Oh, you dare.
[42:42.41]What the fuck just happened?
[42:44.15]You fucking idiot.
[42:53.05]Okay.
[43:03.97]I gotta jump in the air and let it- Ah!
[43:07.20]Now I have to get across?
[43:29.33]Okay.
[43:31.37]Okay.
[43:39.32]What do I do?
[43:44.46]Oh my god.
[43:45.40]I think I have to jump straight in the air.
[43:53.48]Okay.

[44:25.01]Oh my god, it's so fucking stressful.
[44:28.61]I'll get it.
[44:32.37]I'll jump a little higher.
[44:40.08]Oh god.
[44:41.26]Now what?
[44:43.04]I can't see!
[44:43.80]Holy fuck me!

[45:08.83]Can you please leave?
[45:17.89]Okay.
[45:41.40]Now what?
[45:42.24]Jump up straight in the air and carry to the left.
[45:44.72]The wind is getting inside.
[45:49.92]But it's too much work to seal the entrance!
[45:56.40]No... What the fuck do I do now?
[46:05.19]Uh... Where?
[46:08.99]In the middle?
[46:11.20]Right into the middle, but wouldn't that drop me down?
[46:19.62]I see over on the right, but how do I get into that room?
[46:29.79]I don't want to go in the middle.
[46:32.13]That room on the right, I can't make that jump.
[46:34.13]Do I have to slide off of the right side?
[46:49.88]Nope.
[46:59.81]Oh, fuck.
[47:02.09]Oh my god.
[47:02.87]Where am I?
[47:04.55]What the fuck?

[49:17.39]Oh my fuck.
[49:18.75]Okay.
[49:19.83]Jump to the left.
[49:24.87]Maybe Jump King wasn't the smartest idea.
[49:27.19]Ah, a dog batter.
[49:28.19]It was gonna creep up on me anyways.
[49:30.43]Oops.
[49:31.87]Too much.

[50:01.92]I'm going for it right now.

[50:04.00]I actually did it.
[50:07.26]Now what?

[50:38.29]Oh, this is really bad.
[50:39.26]This is game over.
[50:39.78]This is stream over.
[50:41.78]If I fall down even more, this is stream over.
[50:49.52]Oh, yeah.
[50:50.22]I haven't done this in a long... Oh, fuck.
[50:53.25]Ay-yi-yi.

[53:24.25]Yeah, I don't know if I can handle it.
[53:27.43]I knew that I was going to get crept up on.
[53:30.41]It happened a lot faster than I thought was going to happen.
[53:32.45]You know what?
[53:32.81]I'm just glad that we could play keep talking and nobody explodes.
[53:36.54]Because that was the plan tonight and fuck me.

[54:57.33]Yeah, it's critical right now.
[55:00.85]Oh yeah.
[55:01.65]It's over.
[55:03.11]It's over.
[55:03.55]We're at critical headache.
[55:07.10]I think I'm going all the way down.
[55:08.04]Alright, I'm going to try this one more time.
[55:23.60]Oh my god.
[55:24.18]Do I have like a fever?
[55:25.93]What's going on?

[56:33.31]Let's go.
[56:38.89]Alright, let's do it.
[56:42.99]What just happened?
[56:43.63]Okay, I think the controller fucking unplugged again.
[56:49.52]I fixed this shit already.
[56:54.34]I fixed this controller like a month ago.
[56:56.94]That's a sign from God.
[57:03.02]Not yet.
[57:11.40]Fall right with the wind.
[57:12.02]Here we go.
[57:41.96]Not enough.
[57:45.71]I gotta go a little harder than that.
[57:50.40]Go get some rest?
[57:51.72]I will, don't worry.
[58:04.85]So, and another thing too, this is why I was like, fuck, I don't want to stream for two hours today.
[58:11.06]There's no stream tomorrow because I have a doctor's appointment that's going to last a while.
[58:18.38]So I will not be streaming tomorrow.
[58:22.91]But I will continue the day after that.
[58:25.43]And we'll probably, you know, we're probably going to start Katana Zero.
[58:27.85]We'll just do it.
[58:29.81]That's like a five hour game, right?
[58:43.77]I just want to get up there and try one more time.
[58:45.89]No, I just want to try again.
[58:48.77]I just want to save a checkpoint up here so I can... Oh, it's not fair.
[58:52.50]Oh, Kingsway.
[58:56.72]Kingsway looks fun too.
[59:03.22]Oh my fucking god, Jeremy.
[59:08.14]What's Kingsway?
[59:08.78]It's like a weird...
[59:10.77]web browser rpg pop-up window thing it looks really really interesting all right next attempt here we go I gotta be a little bit harder not too hard though with the wind all right
[59:45.20]okay harder than that I gotta wait okay what's up here okay um
[60:12.94]Oh my god, no, no, no, no, my god!
[60:17.63]Where am I?
[60:18.05]Where the fuck is my character?
[60:25.59]No, you... Stop!
[60:35.58]Alright, last attempt, and I actually have to leave.
[60:42.42]He's actually crying.
[60:44.94]I just wanted to fucking be chunking.
[60:57.63]Too much.
[60:58.43]Way too much.
[60:58.99]Alright, goodbye.
[61:01.95]I'm done.
[61:03.15]Done.
[61:03.55]Done.
[61:03.85]Done.
[61:04.15]I'm done.
[61:04.45]I'm saving everything.
[61:05.47]I'll pick it up another day.
[61:06.68]Alright.
[61:08.58]I gotta go.
[61:11.68]That's a fun game?
[61:12.16]The game's fun.
[61:13.42]It's a fun game.
[61:18.37]I just, my fucking head is on fire.
[61:21.63]It's so, I hate fucking headaches more than anything.
[61:24.85]I would rather, I would rather shit my pants on stream and sit in it than have a migraine on stream.
[61:31.79]Because one of them you wouldn't even, you wouldn't even know happened.
[61:35.35]I would rather shit my pants and sit here in it.
[61:36.91]Like seriously, I would than have a fucking migraine.
[61:43.06]But anyways, I'll see you guys again on Tuesday.
[61:49.40]As of Tuesday, we'll probably go... We'll do at least two or three days in a row as of Tuesday.
[61:53.84]Because we did two days one day.
[61:55.14]We'll do two or three days in a row.
[61:56.12]Yeah, makes sense.
[61:58.58]Either Katana Zero, Kingsway, or... Or... No More Heroes 2.
[62:08.93]Let's start that.
[62:11.99]Or...
[62:13.92]I don't know, maybe like a GameCube game?
[62:15.80]I don't know.
[62:19.26]We'll see.
[62:20.18]Katana Zero, yeah, we'll see.
[62:22.46]All right, guys, I'm going to go through the bits.
[62:24.58]It shouldn't take us too long.
[62:26.62]Thank you so much for watching.
[62:28.28]Earlier, that was a lot of fun.
[62:29.34]I did some progress in Jump King, too.
[62:32.60]Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes was actually really fun.
[62:36.69]It was just all over the place.
[62:38.45]It's exactly what I thought was going to happen.
[62:41.05]I guess we'll do that again and switch roles and see if we can do it.
[62:46.70]Am I going to do yesterday's bits too?
[62:48.11]Oh, wait, that's right.
[62:48.95]Fuck, because I got cut off.
[62:51.71]I might not be able to sit here for that long, unfortunately.
[62:57.95]Let me see.
[62:58.35]How many were there?
[63:00.87]I'm sorry.
[63:01.57]I'm just going to be real.
[63:02.41]Let's see how many there were.
[63:08.31]Because there's like a knife in my head right now.
[63:13.93]Let's see.
[63:22.64]Let's restore... Yeah, I'm sorry guys, I can't sit here for this long.
[63:39.85]I wish I could, I really do.
[63:43.95]He's currently getting a lobotomy.
[63:49.51]I will do these when I come back, though.
[63:51.89]And they're going to be very irrelevant, but I don't want to just blow them off.
[63:55.72]Blame fucking shitty internet yesterday.
[64:00.04]We'll do it.
[64:00.62]I promise.
[64:01.02]I just can't do it right now.
[64:04.76]I can get through the ones from today.
[64:06.51]Because there's only about five or six of them.
[64:12.91]I do apologize, though.
[64:13.81]Seriously.
[64:14.67]But I'll see you guys on Tuesday, for those of you taking off.
[64:17.34]If you want to stick around for the last bits of the stream here before I get out of here and dunk my head in cold water.
[64:23.77]I'll see you soon.
[64:29.15]I can quit this.
[64:33.91]Just do both next time?
[64:35.03]No, there's really only like six.
[64:37.63]I think there's like six or seven here.
[64:39.35]Yeah, there's not very many.
[64:40.15]This won't take very long.
[64:42.05]So, earlier we had...
[64:48.04]We had a thousand bits from SSJ Mac.
[64:51.06]Thank you, Mac.
[64:53.00]Thanks for the ten bucks.
[64:53.72]Hey, German, thanks for making me laugh for like seven years.
[64:55.70]When are you going to bring back the coffee commentary of Justice and Doom?
[65:01.20]No, I remember those.
[65:12.25]Probably never.
[65:13.81]That's just every stream now.
[65:16.47]Thank you for the 1,000 bits, though.
[65:17.51]Appreciate it.
[65:18.53]Sam of the Freelance Police.
[65:20.17]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[65:21.17]Hey, German.
[65:21.49]Happy 2020.
[65:21.85]You've been a constant companion for most of the past decade.
[65:25.69]Hope this continues into this decade.
[65:28.05]I go to university abroad, and your streams always make me feel cozy and less alone.
[65:32.70]P.S.
[65:33.04]Please go back to the EU-friendly schedule.
[65:37.14]I'm happy to be a voice that you recognize and a voice that you are used to.
[65:44.70]That can either be in the background or if you're completely attentive to everything going on in the stream.
[65:52.77]Thank you so much for the support.
[65:54.95]And yes, I will be going back to between 1 and 2 p.m.
[65:57.85]Pacific starting in the next couple weeks.
[66:00.72]I will make sure I let you know.
[66:02.98]But I do want to get back on that.
[66:04.08]It was just a couple things that made it so I couldn't.
[66:07.56]But yeah, thank you for the 500 bits.
[66:09.88]Niall Orion, thanks for the 300 bits.
[66:11.34]Jerma is the Chris Jericho of streaming.
[66:15.25]how huh effectator thanks for the 250 germo don't you don't understand I actually obsessed over the bomb game last year I learned morse code just for the bomb defusal and got to the point where I could defuse the first one before the lights came on what oh my god
[66:44.31]How do you do that before?
[66:45.17]How is that even possible?
[66:46.21]Don't the lights turn on when you... Hold on, I'm confused.
[66:49.63]Hold on, look at this.
[66:54.25]Not that.
[66:56.09]How don't the lights come on when you touch the bomb?
[67:12.17]See what I'm saying?
[67:13.95]I thought when you touch it, the lights turn on.
[67:17.11]There's a brief second of delay.
[67:21.28]Jesus.
[67:21.66]Oh my god.
[67:26.78]Yeah, so watching this stream, you must have been sitting there going, I could do this shit in my sleep.
[67:36.55]Thank you, though.
[67:37.19]We'll get better.
[67:37.99]We'll get better.
[67:38.81]We'll get better.
[67:40.24]Morning Maple, thanks for the 300 bits.
[67:41.68]Mutilated man for next German Rumble.
[67:43.28]Make him have a floppy intestine dangling.
[67:45.18]I don't even know what I just read.
[67:46.27]I should, was that, was that a bad thing?
[67:48.57]I don't know what that I just read.
[67:50.35]Um, I don't know what that was.
[67:51.51]Uh, but I don't know about that.
[67:54.77]Thanks for the 300 bits.
[67:55.81]Morning Maple.
[67:57.15]Freudian Weapon, thanks for 250.
[67:58.37]What the hell are you eating before bed that's giving you those kind of dreams?
[68:02.85]Not anything ridiculous.
[68:05.97]Oh, from your dream.
[68:08.65]Oh, right, right, right.
[68:12.25]Okay, I want to copy and paste all the text I punched into the iPad because it is delirious.
[68:21.72]I wrote it so quickly.
[68:22.64]I have to like pull that over here.
[68:27.04]I'll do that like in a couple days.
[68:28.02]I'll show you.
[68:30.26]But thank you, Freudian, for the $2.50.
[68:33.50]Also, thank you to Cookie Inva for the 500 bits.
[68:36.04]Hey, Jerma.
[68:37.12]My girlfriend recently ended our four-year relationship because she doesn't love me anymore.
[68:40.60]I'm pretty down, and you help me so much.
[68:43.66]I met your YouTube channel in the old days, and though I can't sleep, I got to finally catch a stream live of yours.
[68:53.26]Sorry to hear that it's a long time.
[68:54.76]Four years is a significant time in a relationship, but...
[69:01.80]The one thing you can bring from that that's positive, that really is positive, is... When you date somebody for that long and it doesn't work out, just, I guess, be... Look on the bright side of if it lasted, like, another few years.
[69:20.02]You know, then you're talking five, six, seven years.
[69:24.65]It's a lot longer and it's a lot more to process.
[69:26.39]Four years is a long time, but... I am certain that you'll find somebody else.
[69:35.44]And it wasn't meant to be.
[69:40.56]That's all you can take from it, is just know that it was not meant to be.
[69:45.35]Eventually, it will be to be.
[69:54.51]Much love to you, though.
[70:01.19]Using somebody to teach math?
[70:03.05]What do you mean, math?
[70:06.05]What?
[70:08.13]Let's get the credits on here.
[70:10.27]Roll them.
[70:12.57]Short stream.
[70:14.09]We'll see you Tuesday.
[70:16.31]Thanks everybody.
[70:17.42]Even if you subbed over the course of this almost just barely three hour stream.
[70:24.36]It's a little one.
[70:24.90]It's a compact one.
[70:25.64]Yeah, it is.
[70:28.36]I have a doctor's appointment tomorrow.
[70:29.46]Tomorrow, the doctor's appointment actually is something I'm really looking forward to because it is with a new doctor that we're going to start to talk about what I'm going to do about my rib cage problem and my hernia.
[70:43.92]So I'm... This is an appointment I've been looking forward to, so... I do not want to miss it.
[70:54.89]But, thank you, all of you.
[70:58.10]Hey Jamie, thanks for the 500 bits, Jamie.
[71:00.36]You could do a chill pottery stream sometime to show the pottery training you did for Bugleberry so it doesn't go to waste.
[71:08.47]Yeah, it didn't take that much time.
[71:12.83]It took like three weeks to get that stream set up, the whole thing.
[71:17.23]But the pottery, it was like four or five hours.
[71:20.57]Like four and a half hours total of classes.
[71:23.13]So it's not like I spent months or weeks preparing for it.
[71:36.19]Do it anyways?
[71:37.45]You lied again.
[71:38.21]No, I said it took... Wait, when did I say I did three weeks of pottery lessons?
[71:41.44]Oh, wait, maybe I did.
[71:42.64]Maybe I was just fucking around.
[71:46.52]I mean, I took pottery lessons and it was like five hours of classes.
[71:55.45]Oh, he's backtracking.
[71:56.73]Is that a lie?
[71:57.49]No, didn't I say it took three weeks to get that all ready?
[72:02.79]Maybe I did lie.
[72:03.41]I don't think I did.
[72:07.67]Hey, grandpa pissed thanks in the 250 just wonder what happened to the previous 984 Germans well the first like 200 were mixed up into a pot of Fucking liquid and the two hundred one two hundred first one drank them got all the power And then I guess I don't know what else you want Oh, yeah, that's right.
[72:33.18]I'll show I'll show the cake Mario thing before I leave
[72:37.37]But thank you, Grandpa Piss.
[72:39.05]Thank you, Pablo, for 500 bits.
[72:41.25]Happy 40 months, nerd.
[72:42.67]That's a very long time.
[72:44.75]I have to do new bit badges and sub badges.
[72:47.29]I gotta get on some of this shit for 2020.
[72:50.97]I will, I promise.
[72:52.90]I will get them done.
[72:55.10]Thank you for the 40 continuous months of supporting this stream.
[72:58.36]Jesus.
[73:00.32]Goregrinder, thanks for the 300 bits.
[73:02.18]I hope your appointment goes well tomorrow.
[73:03.94]Thanks for a bomb-ass stream.
[73:06.87]Thank you for being here.
[73:07.55]Thanks for watching.
[73:08.80]I do too.
[73:09.26]Hope it goes well.
[73:12.36]VPCint, thanks for 300 bits.
[73:14.64]Hey, Germa, I had a massive migraine two days in a row and lost both days sleeping.
[73:19.28]Try and get rid of it.
[73:20.12]Both days you cheered me up and made me feel so much better being there streaming when I woke up and felt better.
[73:24.42]I appreciate that.
[73:25.79]I gave bits yesterday, but I don't know if you read them yet.
[73:27.53]I wanted you to say my name, LOL.
[73:30.27]It's Dayjen.
[73:33.17]Dayjen.
[73:34.03]Thank you, Dayjen.
[73:36.24]And yeah, migraines are the worst, especially the worst migraines can just come on you and there's nothing you can do.
[73:43.77]Even if you take Tylenol or Advil, it just doesn't work.
[73:47.44]It's just, it's like a different kind of headache.
[73:50.26]It's such a pain in the ass, but yeah, they are the worst.
[73:57.30]Thank you for the 300 bits, though.
[73:58.34]Appreciate it.
[73:59.88]BD Lou J. BD Lou J. Thanks for the 500 bits.
[74:05.41]I was in a Discord chat with my friends while watching.
[74:07.45]Yo, shout out to Alex and Kiefer.
[74:09.89]And we all had a blast seeing you and Joel yell at each other like idiots.
[74:12.93]And also play Jump King like a pro.
[74:14.82]I'm alright.
[74:15.64]Thanks for the laughs as usual.
[74:16.66]You always brighten my day.
[74:17.72]Love you, Joe.
[74:18.52]Thank you.
[74:20.60]Thank you so much.
[74:24.10]You guys hanging out in a Skype call.
[74:27.36]And just fucking, I love that.
[74:28.70]That makes me happy.
[74:31.34]Excedrin's good for migraines.
[74:33.56]Yeah, doesn't Excedrin have a shitload of caffeine in it though?
[74:37.18]And I take in a lot of caffeine anyways.
[74:44.28]No, it's just be in a dark room and keep my eyes closed pretty much is how I get rid of them.
[74:48.92]Thankfully they don't have them that much anymore.
[74:51.85]I think, realistically, only a few streams over the last year have really been shut off from a migraine, so that's pretty good.
[74:59.07]At least I'm happy about that.
[74:59.83]It doesn't happen all the time.
[75:02.35]Uh, thank you 90who for the 500 bits.
[75:04.59]I made you a gift of pizza before you go, deep brain.
[75:07.74]No, that's not it.
[75:17.78]Pepperoni pizza.
[75:18.84]Yeah, he almost got me there.
[75:23.24]He kept saying the word pizza and pepperonis and stuff, and I almost left.
[75:26.35]What'd you do to my mouth?
[75:32.52]Why is my mouth so strange-looking?
[75:36.21]Dubski dude, thanks for the 250.
[75:37.69]I want to make a formal apology.
[75:39.49]A week ago, I tried contributing to the giant enemy spider meme.
[75:42.05]But in the process, I accidentally brought the tricked-you-flog pyro joke back from the dead.
[75:48.13]It's already spiraling out of control.
[75:50.84]Even Vinny is getting hit with the clip out of context.
[75:53.58]Now we have not one, but two five-year-old derma jokes running amok.
[75:57.14]Hope one day chat can forgive me.
[76:00.08]Yeah, this is rising of the dead here.
[76:03.70]This is the second one.
[76:10.75]Vinny, he probably just is like, what the fuck is this?
[76:16.51]And that's it, guys.
[76:18.67]I will see you on Tuesday.
[76:19.71]Again, sorry for the abrupt short stream that just turned off.
[76:26.28]But, you know, you do what you gotta do.
[76:28.70]And I gotta do this.
[76:31.04]Thank you all again so much for your support.
[76:36.10]And it's Joel streaming, right?
[76:38.46]Let's go say hello to Joel.
[76:39.66]Let's go, Rachel.
[76:41.85]We were playing with Joel earlier, so... Yeah, he's still going.
[76:50.17]He's doing Zelda Ocarina of Half-Life.
[76:52.94]Plus garbage field leftovers.
[76:58.58]Alright, go, uh... Go tell Joel.
[77:02.15]Go say Joel... Blame him for my headache.
[77:06.40]See, like, dude, I do, dude, Jerma had to turn his stream off.
[77:09.96]Because of, like, you gave him such a bad headache.
[77:20.55]Okay, Mario, that's right.
[77:21.71]Hold on, let me get it.
[77:22.29]I'll be right back.
[77:46.96]Thank you.
[78:14.54]Okay, so... This is, uh... This is gonna go... I'm gonna put this in my bathroom.
[78:23.57]You ready?
[78:27.67]This is going in my bathroom.
[78:32.81]Cake Mario.
[78:34.11]Stop hitting me.
[78:34.69]What?
[78:34.79]What are you talking about?
[78:38.58]What do you think?
[78:43.41]It's like four versions of Cake Mario.
[78:50.82]It's ugly?
[78:51.42]What?
[78:53.16]What do you mean it's ugly as shit?
[78:59.59]Who said that?
[79:00.99]That's not true.
[79:03.27]Is it?
[79:03.53]It's going in my bathroom.
[79:04.35]It's going right above my toilet.
[79:09.47]It's going right into the toilet.
[79:11.04]Well, not right above.
[79:12.10]It's going right above the toilet.
[79:17.98]Alright, I'll see you guys on Tuesday.
[79:20.68]Let's, uh, let's raid Joel.
[79:24.67]I love this thing.
[79:25.37]It's fucking all, it's all the cake Marios.
[79:27.43]Alright, see you later.
[79:34.49]Here we go.
[79:40.57]Take care guys.
