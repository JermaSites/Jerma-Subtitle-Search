[00:17.04]How's it going?
[00:20.53]What is happening?
[00:21.55]How are you?
[00:22.33]What kind of tea do I got?
[00:25.01]Uh, black tea today, actually.
[00:31.77]I said I don't drink black tea, but I really want the caffeine.
[00:35.48]Today.
[00:42.51]And it's black tea with nothing in it.
[00:45.91]Which is the worst kind of black tea.
[00:52.30]Black tea with nothing in it just kind of tastes like water.
[00:55.88]With.
[00:57.48]OK, do you know?
[00:58.64]You don't like like a seltzer water.
[01:04.04]Seltzer water just has that... It's water with a little bit of flavor.
[01:09.00]Just a little bit.
[01:10.58]Black tea is just kind of dry water with a hint of something.
[01:15.78]Kind of bitter.
[01:16.20]I normally would put honey or sugar in it, but not today.
[01:21.23]I don't really have any.
[01:28.77]Alright, let me tweet.
[01:30.25]And we'll go.
[01:34.98]Give me one second.
[02:10.07]Alright, let me get comfortable.
[02:10.91]Get this out of the way.
[02:13.59]Today we're going to play World Box.
[02:17.29]This was in the recommended channel.
[02:20.11]Looks pretty fun.
[02:21.15]It's a game where you just kind of control everything.
[02:26.48]I guess you watch civilizations kind of come and go.
[02:31.68]It's a god game.
[02:35.24]Seems kind of fun.
[02:37.66]I've heard it's very, very interesting.
[02:43.89]They just had an update, I think.
[02:45.61]Looks like it.
[02:46.01]A day or two ago?
[02:48.59]Today, maybe?
[02:49.11]I don't even know.
[02:51.90]God Complex Andy.
[02:54.50]Are you drinking hot Dr. Pepper?
[03:02.90]I feel like that would not be as bad as I think it is.
[03:15.91]It's bad.
[03:16.49]Okay, if you took 70% of the sugar.
[03:21.99]Oh, fuck.
[03:22.49]Hold on.
[03:22.77]I got to restart the game.
[03:25.57]Hold on a second.
[03:27.78]I've been idling here for like 20 minutes.
[03:31.16]Hold on.
[03:31.44]I got to restart.
[03:37.86]If you took like 70% of the sugar out of Dr. Pepper, I feel like it would not even be that hot.
[03:47.15]Although, I have no idea.
[03:49.33]It could be awful.
[03:54.44]Let me reopen it.
[03:57.00]Alright.
[04:00.36]Is this a randomly generated?
[04:01.36]I think it is, right?
[04:04.40]There we go.
[04:04.84]Okay.

[24:31.46]This kingdom is disintegrating.
[24:34.78]The one guy kingdom.
[24:35.92]24 versus 13.
[24:40.02]Wait, they're all defecting over here.
[24:48.62]Why are they all defecting?
[24:49.62]Is it because this area is just fucked up?
[25:00.02]Because it's lava, I can change that.
[25:12.37]There.
[25:17.23]And make some cool water.
[25:30.22]Nice ice cold water.
[25:40.88]Oh, another human kingdom over here.
[25:46.78]It's because you gave them a chicken.
[25:51.17]What, and it, like, created a whole civilization?
[25:55.11]What about, wait, where are all the frogs?
[25:58.39]Did they eat all the frogs or something?
[26:00.39]Wait, how can I see where all the animals are?
[26:04.46]Statistics about your world.
[26:07.40]A hundred deaths!
[26:10.96]What?
[26:11.14]What?
[26:16.00]no I'm sorry I'm sorry this is not I'm not gonna let this I'm not gonna let this slide I'm sorry get out of here that's too much expansion no I'm sorry that's not I'm sorry you don't that's too much expansion
[26:48.41]Candy?
[26:50.79]Create the candy biome.
[26:53.32]Should I just make candy island over here?
[26:54.70]Okay, I'm gonna make candy island over here.
[27:03.90]Oh wait, should I just put a bunch of can- wait.
[27:06.08]Okay, so this candy over here.
[27:10.50]Corrupted seeds, mushroom seeds, grass seeds.
[27:14.66]Let's make them fight for this island.
[27:21.86]It already was grass, but let's make it really, really just like nice and lush.
[27:30.21]Okay.
[27:36.01]They're persevering.
[27:36.79]Okay.
[27:49.68]Is the orc actually going to be able to kill the bear?
[27:51.92]No.
[27:53.78]Oh, wait a minute.
[27:54.48]This is probably a bad idea.
[27:58.04]Alright, get rid of this.
[28:02.50]There's enough of this.
[28:03.80]I just want to make it a little harder for them.
[28:09.50]Cad Till has become the biggest kingdom.
[28:12.02]And the one guy kingdom.
[28:13.08]Wait, where's the actual one guy?
[28:15.20]How many kids do you have?
[28:22.40]39?
[28:22.42]Holy shit, dude.
[28:31.15]Every... Wait, that's kind of fucked up.
[28:38.25]Doesn't that imply that... Wait, how is it possible that you've had 38 children?
[28:44.57]And there's 38 people here.
[28:57.02]I don't know.
[28:57.56]I think I have to get a tornado.
[28:59.66]From the other kingdom?
[29:00.58]Uh-oh.
[29:04.86]We're gonna fight here.
[29:07.22]Are they gonna go for it?
[29:09.31]Are they going for it?
[29:13.57]The orcs over here are scattered.
[29:15.39]They're not... They're not preparing.
[29:20.39]No.
[29:21.11]They backed down.
[29:24.53]Wait, where'd they...
[29:26.53]Where they going?
[29:27.81]Uh-oh.
[29:33.03]They're getting an army ready over here too.
[29:34.57]Dude, what's with all the lightning?
[29:40.54]They're kind of just hanging out.
[29:49.13]Huh?
[29:58.48]Alright, check this out.
[29:59.54]Let's make this whole thing fucking awful.
[30:02.86]Fruit bushes right in the middle.
[30:04.12]Good luck.
[30:08.10]Fight over the bushes.
[30:10.14]Amuse me.
[30:11.18]Fight over these fruit bushes.
[30:12.44]Amuse me.
[30:25.09]Come on.
[30:25.49]Uh-oh.
[30:30.46]Wait, what is this person doing?
[30:33.88]They... Oh, no, they're part of this place.
[30:44.11]38 children.
[30:45.13]Is that even... I feel like at some point it's just... I don't know.
[30:52.33]236% full hunger.
[31:03.89]That's gonna get ugly over here.
[31:08.37]Who's got the biggest kingdom?
[31:10.63]77!
[31:11.51]They've been very busy.
[31:19.11]Villages.
[31:22.19]Different cultures.
[31:26.05]Force kingdom to start a war.
[31:30.00]When used on a village, that's not a capital.
[31:31.68]It becomes its own kingdom.
[31:34.96]Alright, I'm curious about this.
[31:36.04]Let's take a look.
[31:38.60]11 houses, 16 people in the army, 27... How did- who died?
[31:48.09]Okay, so this is the leader of this village.
[31:50.49]They have no children.
[31:51.45]Are they getting boats?
[31:58.95]Oh, he got killed by a bear, that's right.
[32:07.07]no battles okay still no fight yet what about a dog you guys who should get the dogs you can all have it okay you can all have three dogs
[32:40.66]Weird building pattern.
[32:46.29]They kind of came back strong, though.
[32:51.57]You guys... Let's put a couple of cows.
[33:06.10]Wait, I can make enemies?
[33:07.28]Alright, who should deal with the first...
[33:13.80]Who should deal with the first group of, uh, like, attacking bandits?
[33:24.01]Oh my god, there's so much more that I didn't see.
[33:26.23]A dragon?
[33:31.09]UFO?
[33:34.37]Beehive?
[33:37.42]Make monster island.
[33:40.78]Alright, hold on.
[33:41.34]First I'm gonna make
[33:44.19]We need to make... Somebody... A village has to get attacked by bandits.
[33:54.10]Make Dragon Island.
[33:56.64]This thing is scary.
[33:58.48]Alright, who is the most progressed?
[34:01.32]It's either... Yubordran... ES... Or Ashtod.
[34:13.07]Who needs a challenge here?
[34:17.63]ES?
[34:20.27]I can check.
[34:20.81]Yeah, let's see who could use a challenge.
[34:24.37]Statistics about your world.
[34:27.13]No, where would I find it?
[34:28.73]World laws?
[34:31.45]Kingdoms can declare wars and treaties.
[34:33.41]Yeah.
[34:34.43]Cities can rebel when have low loyalty.
[34:37.39]So that's what we've seen.
[34:39.31]Kingdoms will send settlers to establish new villages.
[34:42.21]They have armies.
[34:44.01]Allows the stealing of borders.
[34:46.63]Babies will be born.
[34:49.06]Everyone needs food to live and creatures can die of old age.
[34:52.58]Baby animals can be born.
[34:54.24]Animals can randomly spawn.
[34:55.44]Okay.
[34:58.82]So...
[35:09.57]World history.
[35:11.55]Demons from another realm have invaded this world.
[35:16.04]What?
[35:19.56]Since when?
[35:20.18]I didn't have to do anything.
[35:29.25]This thing has almost 600 health.
[35:35.53]Alright, let's see.
[35:36.23]Here, here you go.
[35:36.97]You guys can have, like, a bunch of chickens.
[35:39.37]And, like, two cows.
[35:41.15]And let's, like, bless them with water.
[35:55.20]And here, have some, like, some grass seeds.
[35:59.02]Good luck.
[36:01.58]This, they're looking at each other from over, okay?
[36:03.40]Okay.
[36:08.35]So now they can start their entire kingdom over here.
[36:13.16]They're already doing machinery.
[36:15.70]Ah!
[36:17.58]What's going on here?
[36:21.74]Nobody in it.
[36:23.44]Is this a diplomatic ambassador?
[36:25.88]To the demon kingdom?
[36:27.89]I don't know.
[36:41.04]Stone?
[36:42.12]Uh, let's put some... Actually, you know what?
[36:43.56]Let's put some stone up here.
[36:44.48]I feel like they need it.
[36:47.62]They definitely need it.
[36:48.24]I just killed, like, three people.
[36:53.91]Oops.
[36:59.47]Fill the hole up here?
[37:07.39]Now mine this for resources.
[37:11.12]Plants?
[37:14.62]Alright, let's do some plants over here.
[37:22.20]Lemon seeds?
[37:28.79]On the top of the mountain.
[37:34.33]They're getting close to each other.
[37:42.74]Hourglass?
[37:43.32]Change the flow of... Oh!
[37:48.71]What happened?
[37:49.37]Baby tornado?
[37:50.97]What's going on?
[37:51.47]Why are we all celebrating?
[37:54.73]What happened?
[37:56.97]What are we celebrating?
[38:04.47]The King Oz of Zagad is dead.
[38:07.88]Oh, I crushed him with a rock.
[38:13.58]Zoom out?
[38:18.79]Oh.
[38:19.47]Why is there a tornado kingdom?
[38:25.23]And why would the whole world celebrate a tornado?
[38:32.68]Oh, right.
[38:33.88]Uh-oh.
[38:35.68]Okay.
[38:37.54]Okay.
[38:41.67]Favorite units.
[38:42.81]Oh, I should have favorited the guy that had like 40 kids.
[38:47.87]Can you handle that?
[38:48.53]I think they have the biggest army.
[39:06.50]I'm picking favorites here, but it's alright.
[39:11.02]I'm gonna give it to everybody, don't worry.
[39:24.95]What are you doing?
[39:28.09]Favorite food, cider.
[39:29.63]Mood, normal.
[39:31.29]Children, 16.
[39:31.81]Is this like a... I don't know.
[39:41.80]Need to put more plants?
[39:47.13]Need more plants, you think?
[39:54.79]Should we make it?
[39:55.73]Let's heat something up.
[39:58.79]When do they start killing each other?
[40:00.47]I don't know.
[40:03.19]I would imagine probably soon.
[40:04.61]There's nowhere else to go.
[40:12.65]Okay, let's put some... Oh, a hot spring.
[40:19.13]Volcano.
[40:19.77]Snow!
[40:20.13]Okay, let's make some snow.
[40:23.71]This would be nice.
[40:28.45]Look.
[40:30.02]Give him like a winter wonderland.
[40:41.14]Cool.
[40:48.29]I hear hitting.
[40:49.12]What's being hit?
[40:53.28]Oh, they're killing a sheep.
[40:57.78]Alright, should I drop a... I don't want to drop a... A heat ray.
[41:09.63]Robot Santa?
[41:14.72]Ooh, what about fireworks?
[41:16.67]Okay, let's do, let's celebrate the fact that we just had another 30 kids.
[41:32.70]Am I gonna light them?
[41:39.03]What happened?
[41:50.64]The size is too big.
[41:51.84]It's alright.
[41:54.26]I can fix it.
[41:57.52]There.
[41:58.61]That's my apology.
[41:59.51]I gave you like six chickens.
[42:02.51]And some cool water.
[42:12.47]Is it time for war?
[42:17.27]This... Dagpon has 40... Oh, they're all here.
[42:20.84]Alright, looks... I can influence this.
[42:23.48]Here it comes.
[42:23.78]I'm thinking about throwing a fireball at some point.
[42:27.76]Lava.
[42:28.62]No.
[42:29.88]Um... They're getting very close.
[42:38.71]There's a lot of play out.
[42:44.13]Poison the water.
[43:04.74]They're just matching each other's speed.
[43:06.42]Nobody wants to make the first move.
[43:14.96]They're all peaceful with each other.
[43:22.06]45 deaths from hunger.
[43:22.84]Other deaths.
[43:32.50]Are they still over there?
[43:33.21]There's only two.
[43:35.23]Can I pick them up?
[43:43.83]Burning feet.
[43:44.49]Fire blood.
[43:45.25]Fireproof.
[43:45.95]Cool.
[43:49.25]Alright.
[43:49.77]Alright.
[43:51.27]I think this is as big as the world is going to be able to get.
[43:54.07]Because, I mean, we have so many kingdoms here.
[43:56.87]It's time to start a little bit of conflict.
[44:00.69]What do you think?
[44:07.43]Like, okay, I'm just going to put a grenade over here.
[44:10.37]And it's going to be like, what the hell was that?
[44:16.46]Right?
[44:16.74]It's like, what was that?
[44:21.19]Uh oh.
[44:29.78]They're just sittin' at the border!
[44:30.82]We- are we- we- okay, we could... make it be- we could speed the time up a little bit here and see what happens in like a hundred years.
[44:52.05]Increased?
[44:52.53]What was it?
[44:55.99]Times one?
[44:56.49]Okay.
[45:02.94]I could do times two, maybe, right?
[45:05.00]Oh, man.
[45:05.54]Alright.
[45:06.16]What should I do?
[45:07.38]Times five.
[45:11.97]What does the world look like?
[45:12.85]Ah...
[45:19.18]Yeah, this is happening now.
[45:21.26]This is definitely happening.
[45:26.86]No, fuck you.
[45:27.74]No, fuck you.
[45:28.44]No, fuck you.
[45:30.95]How big is their army?
[45:31.61]Attack speed.
[45:38.15]I don't know who's gonna hit first.
[45:40.19]You just drank coffee?
[45:42.37]Here we go.
[45:43.17]Here we go.
[45:43.63]They're getting too close.
[45:51.00]There it goes!
[45:56.66]Oh, no.
[46:00.61]They're fighting over... Oh, they're attacking their huts.
[46:03.91]Let's just freak them out a little.
[46:13.54]I am angry.
[46:14.30]Stop fighting!
[46:15.96]Holy shit, they wiped him out.
[46:20.12]They wiped him out completely.
[46:21.90]Nobody even died here.
[46:29.51]The one guy kingdom is now very strong.
[46:34.03]Absolutely wiped him out.
[46:38.64]That's bad for you.
[46:45.64]Let us bet next time.
[46:47.42]Well, how about this?
[46:48.66]Why don't you bet on who reigns completely supreme here?
[46:55.27]You got... I think the dwarves have been wiped out.
[46:59.61]No, they're not.
[46:59.93]The dwarves are here.
[47:01.91]You've got... I don't know.
[47:03.17]Should we go by kingdom or just humans, dwarves, orcs, or... I don't know.
[47:09.17]But I'm going to be influent.
[47:10.47]This is killing a lot of people.
[47:13.89]Alright, don't vote for these people because the tornado just went through the whole village and I think took out a lot of people.
[47:22.20]Oh man.
[47:22.72]Are they alright?
[47:43.74]Alright, I'm glad I tested that over there because eventually... Oh, God's just testing.
[47:50.20]This is still going.
[47:56.84]I want them to make sure they know who they're dealing with.
[48:07.52]This little tornado is causing so many problems.
[48:12.85]Alright.
[48:13.65]It's where we're at halftime.
[48:15.03]Everybody gets a dozen chickens.
[48:39.54]Why is nobody going to Candy Island?
[48:49.25]It looks like, okay, we can speed up time a little bit now.
[48:54.45]Relations.
[48:56.42]See, it's diplomatic relations with other kingdoms.
[49:01.22]Death is health.
[49:05.02]A militarist?
[49:10.01]Damn, okay.
[49:13.09]War is peace.
[49:14.61]Okay, they're at peace.
[49:17.32]With pretty much everybody.
[49:19.82]Besides... They're not at war with anybody.
[49:21.50]They already destroyed everybody.
[49:22.64]What about you guys?
[49:26.06]They're currently at peace over here too.
[49:30.40]Culture level.
[49:34.37]How many villages this has?
[49:37.33]Peaceful Militarist.
[49:40.51]Click the lightbulb.
[49:47.92]research common knowledges windmill population okay move over here alright nobody else is at war we can change that really quickly though
[50:17.53]I thought they weren't at war.
[50:26.29]They're gonna... Alright.
[50:27.82]We gotta slow them down.
[50:28.54]I'm actually gonna slow them down a little.
[50:33.92]And then... Great heat.
[50:37.42]What are they doing?
[50:44.45]Did you guys already do a poll?
[50:46.51]I don't remember.
[50:47.33]What are they doing over here?
[50:48.49]What's going on here?
[50:52.87]Why are they all hanging around the windmill?
[50:54.21]Alright, let's speed it up.
[51:11.87]Times five.
[51:25.18]Nobody's decided to go over to the islands.
[51:31.87]Wait.
[51:32.11]Something's going on over here.
[51:38.80]Gold mine?
[51:42.66]Change the laws of the world now.
[51:44.06]Okay.
[51:56.86]Okay, here we go.
[51:59.46]Natural disasters.
[52:00.62]Other disasters.
[52:02.04]Minerals.
[52:02.34]We need to start some fights.
[52:03.88]Look at the grayed out options.
[52:06.09]Creep tiles like tumor pumpkin biomass would stay even after base structure is gone.
[52:12.67]Eternal lava.
[52:13.51]Okay.
[52:26.41]Make a volcano.
[52:35.48]Look at the grayed out options.
[52:36.68]Hold on, let me see.
[52:40.18]Peaceful monsters.
[52:43.50]Limit maximum population of 100.
[52:46.66]Villagers will also participate in... Really?
[52:49.11]Okay.
[52:53.79]That's fine.
[52:58.60]Go up.
[52:59.38]Hold on a sec.
[53:01.82]This is as high as I can go.
[53:16.01]Kingdom tab.
[53:18.27]Let's see.
[53:22.54]Okay.
[53:27.67]It's just snowing over here.
[53:30.07]Mods are watching Sopranos.
[53:31.81]That's alright.
[53:43.97]OK, so let's do.
[53:51.39]What is this under development?
[53:52.79]OK.
[53:56.53]Force a kingdom to war.
[53:57.99]I think this is probably going to be very hard to beat.
[54:11.08]Hmm.
[54:15.46]Everyone's kind of just chilling.
[54:16.62]This is fine.
[54:25.22]I want to speed it up one more time.
[54:32.77]Another times five.
[54:33.37]Let's see what happens.
[54:37.04]Put on earthbound OST.
[54:38.64]No, that's not good.
[54:41.68]I need to concentrate.
[54:44.98]Maybe in a minute.
[54:55.32]Alright.
[54:55.80]It's time.
[54:56.48]Here we go.
[54:59.74]Here's my plan.
[55:03.17]I want to see.
[55:09.10]Crabzilla.
[55:10.30]I feel like Crabzilla is going to end the whole thing.
[55:16.12]If I click Crabzilla, this is going to be a disaster.
[55:28.36]This was not my plan to play this all night, by the way.
[55:31.86]I just wanted to check it out.
[55:34.13]I really like this so far, though.
[55:36.49]It's fun just, like, kind of people watching.
[55:40.47]Save it?
[55:40.93]Oh my god, thank you.
[55:45.93]Uh, where's the... No, do not quit.
[55:53.94]There it is.
[55:58.57]Actually, I want to see the difference.
[56:02.35]What's the difference?
[56:05.41]14 years versus 85, four kingdoms, three, two cultures, five, three villages, seven, and then 359 population.
[56:16.36]Okay.
[56:19.94]I'm just, I'm curious.
[56:21.04]I'm curious to see what happens here.
[56:24.13]Let's do something weird.
[56:25.65]Okay.
[56:26.25]Okay.
[56:30.00]Lava cloud?
[56:35.13]Robot Santa.
[56:37.09]Where should Robot Santa spawn?
[56:40.65]How about over here in Candy World?
[56:42.23]Okay.
[56:46.16]So what?
[56:47.10]What if there's two Santas?
[56:48.40]Okay.
[56:59.50]It's not doing anything.
[57:03.86]Oh, it's for everything.
[57:04.80]Right.
[57:05.08]Okay.
[57:10.68]Okay.
[57:10.88]Well, I'm really glad I spawned that over here.
[57:16.84]Wait.
[57:17.62]Look at this.
[57:18.10]Hold on a second.
[57:18.68]I have an idea.
[57:19.82]What am I doing just staying over here?
[57:21.55]Oh, it's because I can only go here.
[57:47.22]Okay, it's forest soil.
[57:48.42]I'm gonna put grass.
[57:52.92]I'll connect it.
[57:54.02]I'm gonna put grass.
[58:08.33]I'm very curious to see what happens here.
[58:10.65]You can make the world way bigger.
[58:13.99]That's pretty cool, but let's see what happens when I do this.
[58:22.47]Jesus.
[58:24.05]Let's make some more elves over here.
[58:25.41]Give them a chance.
[58:27.46]Let's give them a shitload of resources, too.
[58:29.60]Why not?
[58:47.14]Bunch of water.
[58:54.74]Bunch of seeds.
[58:56.34]Bunch of mushrooms.
[59:00.19]Uh... Bunch of enchanted seeds.
[59:03.57]A ton of lemon seeds.
[59:06.87]Tons of fertilizer.
[59:07.73]Oops.
[59:10.25]Bunch of fruit bushes.
[59:11.03]Alright, this is the place to be.
[59:16.01]Lemon Island.
[59:18.95]Animals?
[59:19.33]I put some already.
[59:20.09]I thought they were fighting.
[59:29.93]Okay.
[59:38.06]Let's see what happens.
[59:40.26]There was no pull, right?
[59:41.20]So I can just kind of mess around.
[59:42.93]Now that we have the world is here.
[59:44.33]Ooh!
[59:46.45]Ooh!
[59:48.77]They split off.
[59:50.65]Take a look.
[59:52.75]How are the demons?
[59:56.23]The demons have... It's the same three... Alright, I'm connecting.
[60:00.74]They haven't developed any technology?
[60:03.80]They've just been walking around.
[60:07.70]Give the orcs a boss to fight.
[60:09.06]That's a good idea.
[60:09.90]Alright.
[60:12.68]The orcs are going to fight five skeletons.
[60:18.25]Let's see if they can handle it.
[60:19.47]Look at how huge they are.
[60:20.51]Here we go.
[60:20.81]Ready?
[60:28.51]They destroyed it.
[60:31.00]Oh my god.
[60:31.72]That wasn't even a... Alright, what about... A dragon?
[60:37.56]Alright, it's time for a dragon.
[60:39.02]We're putting a dragon into the Orc Kingdom.
[60:41.02]And we're going to put it up in the corner.
[60:43.06]Here we go.
[60:57.71]What is going on?
[60:59.03]Are these monkeys?
[61:06.13]Wait, there's monkeys that have made... It wants nothing to do with the monkeys over there.
[61:19.28]Why are there so many?
[61:21.48]I didn't put these here.
[61:27.41]Oh my goodness.
[61:28.15]Okay.
[61:29.93]Get him.
[61:30.49]Get the dragon.
[61:32.36]Fight it.
[61:37.46]Oh no.
[61:41.00]What are they even throwing?
[61:48.28]I actually don't want the kingdom over here to die, so I'm going to help.
[61:55.93]Alright, now blow it up.
[61:58.03]Fuck.
[61:58.65]What happened?
[62:00.39]Shit.
[62:06.53]Oh, no.
[62:09.32]They can... Sorry.
[62:10.08]They can rebuild.
[62:10.94]They can rebuild.
[62:11.62]They can rebuild.
[62:15.68]I gotta bless them.
[62:16.38]I gotta help them.
[62:30.02]No, everyone's fine.
[62:33.00]They're doing just fine over here.
[62:35.94]You better stay the fuck away from Monkey Island.
[62:40.63]In fact, I don't trust that you won't.
[62:51.20]Change the size of the rain?
[62:58.74]How do I make it bigger?
[63:00.54]I'll write like this.
[63:03.72]Ooh.
[63:04.08]Alright.
[63:06.57]Let's bless everyone with the cooling, clean, crisp mist.
[63:23.94]There we go.
[63:35.42]Civilization Simulator.
[63:36.86]Alright, how about... People are drowning?
[63:45.81]Who?
[63:45.93]What are you talking about?
[63:53.66]What?
[64:02.42]You're stuck in the wood.
[64:04.36]You're stuck in the wood age?
[64:09.42]This is going well over here.
[64:21.19]They need minerals.
[64:24.97]Okay.
[64:26.69]Like ore.
[64:27.23]Alright.
[64:47.69]Give the monkeys gold.
[64:50.13]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[65:06.45]They deserve it.
[65:11.01]You know what?
[65:11.35]Let's put some gold over here too.
[65:13.95]Let's just give it to everybody.
[65:18.46]We need to make this a little bit more enticing over here.
[65:32.30]Some Mithril.
[65:37.93]So are they going to start making more advanced things?
[65:42.91]Silver.
[65:48.44]The monkeys don't even care about this.
[65:51.30]Oh, god damn it.
[66:03.81]Oh, I think I just killed a few people.
[66:12.15]Stone.
[66:15.32]You gotta get through the daemons.
[66:22.63]Alright, let's pass some time.
[66:23.87]Let's see what happens to our civilizations.
[66:28.14]Curious.
[66:42.07]Okay.
[66:43.87]Oh, wait a minute.
[66:45.71]Something happening over here?
[66:47.64]No.
[66:54.48]This group in the middle here has gotten really, really a lot of people.
[66:59.29]And they're starting to... Hold on.
[67:04.85]Yeah, this is a problem right here.
[67:06.69]The elves have... The elves are probably going to take it.
[67:15.94]Do we need more metal?
[67:16.62]Do we need more metal?
[67:24.23]More ore, too.
[67:25.01]Uh, should I just make ore island?
[67:31.23]Okay, I'm gonna just make a, I'm gonna pick ore island.
[67:59.23]No, this is just developer island.
[68:02.35]Okay.
[68:05.17]Uh, stone.
[68:06.01]Make this a little smaller.
[68:14.45]They're already coming over here.
[68:15.45]Uh-oh, like the demons.
[68:18.31]The demons can actually make it over here now.
[68:20.79]Uh-oh.
[68:22.20]Big mistake.
[68:24.98]They one-shot everybody.
[68:28.57]That's not good.
[68:30.21]I think that was just the king.
[68:32.36]Well, stop coming over here.
[68:33.44]What are you doing?
[68:34.00]Stop.
[68:34.10]Why?
[68:53.59]You know what?
[68:53.87]Just let them fight.
[68:56.23]They're slowly just trickling over here and dying.
[68:59.28]I don't know why they're just running over here.
[69:02.28]They're slowly... Alright, get... I've had enough.
[69:15.37]Why are you still alive?
[69:20.37]Dude, get out of here.
[69:24.03]Oh my god.
[69:24.77]I may have just made a big mistake.
[69:31.78]Well, that's their army, right?
[69:35.78]One demon is going through this whole thing.
[69:39.76]Okay, they got it.
[69:41.42]A lot of people died, though.
[69:47.77]Oh, they've made another kingdom.
[69:49.09]Okay, let's keep going.
[69:59.20]Alright, this silver.
[70:00.12]Let's do ore.
[70:04.16]And then I'm going to speed it up times five.
[70:08.58]And see what happens.
[70:12.83]No, no, no.
[70:13.23]You don't own this.
[70:14.25]This is developer island.
[70:16.15]You don't own this.
[70:19.36]Ugh.
[70:21.90]Ugh.
[70:30.70]Nobody owns this.
[70:31.96]Nobody owns this!
[70:33.06]Stop making a- You're not making a town here.
[70:45.27]You're really gonna- Alright.
[70:46.39]Who are these people?
[70:47.31]You're really gonna come over here and claim Developer Island?
[70:49.71]Now you've angered me.
[71:03.88]Holy shit.
[71:04.46]That's not what I thought that was going to do.
[71:06.92]But it worked.
[71:12.82]Oh!
[71:15.76]I thought it bounced down.
[71:16.70]It's okay.
[71:22.54]It's all good.
[71:27.23]Stop.
[71:27.75]Stop.
[71:29.15]You know what?
[71:30.25]Whatever.
[71:30.55]Go ahead and claim it.
[71:34.30]How's Monkey Island doing?
[71:37.30]They're thriving up here.
[71:40.00]Look at it.
[71:40.44]Everything's peaceful.
[71:41.42]Everyone's friends.
[71:43.38]It's rhinoceroses and chickens and frogs.
[71:47.45]They defended it from a dragon.
[71:48.83]They're growing trees.
[71:51.21]They're being sustainable up here.
[71:54.01]Look at this.
[72:05.82]I want a little bit more ore.
[72:06.92]Let's do gold, too.
[72:15.48]And then adamantite.
[72:23.61]Okay, we have our ore island.
[72:26.47]And let's do some bushes, too.
[72:28.27]Berries.
[72:28.61]Oh, I can't put it there.
[72:35.06]Why not?
[72:35.60]Sure, we're like a geyser.
[72:39.04]Cool.
[72:42.43]Okay.
[72:47.01]Um... Again, I mean, this is... Wouldn't you want to claim this whole area?
[72:55.02]If you've got, like, ten different civilizations on Earth, and all the... And resources are running out.
[73:02.24]And all of a sudden...
[73:04.06]Half a mile off the coast, the water level drops, and there's an island with every valuable resource ever invented.
[73:14.43]You're going to cause a lot of problems.
[73:21.91]Okay.
[73:24.80]Let's speed it up.
[73:26.32]And then we can do some wacky stuff.
[73:31.50]They've already, yeah, they already claimed it.
[73:33.46]The humans.
[73:34.06]Wait, is it the humans or the dwarves?
[73:37.84]I don't know if this is going to be a fight here.
[73:40.26]They've already claimed it.
[73:49.79]Kingdom lair.
[73:55.27]Looks like these two are, this one's doing the best.
[73:59.35]This one's stayed out of most of the conflict.
[74:05.32]This one stayed pretty much not many fights or anything.
[74:10.10]These people have been in a fight.
[74:11.24]These people obviously have been in a fight.
[74:14.02]The elves have not really done very much.
[74:27.35]Monkey Island's doing fine.
[74:28.65]Wait, Monkey Island's getting attacked by lightning.
[74:31.11]Oh, no, it's not.
[74:33.17]Okay, cool.
[74:42.38]Oh, that's not good.
[74:43.62]It's happening over here.
[74:49.48]Which island is mine?
[74:50.68]I don't know.
[74:56.58]They're on the border over here.
[75:00.64]The other thing that I was going to do today, I wanted to play Pizza Tower.
[75:04.88]I was going to load that up after this.
[75:16.37]Everybody hates the candy kingdom.
[75:20.19]Yeah, I'm surprised nobody's... Yeah, I think nobody likes it.
[75:24.55]Let's get some stats here.
[75:25.39]520.
[75:26.65]Total infected.
[75:31.93]Infected, I don't know what that means.
[75:38.44]Yeah, they claimed it.
[75:46.73]Alright, let's see what happens.
[75:47.87]I'm going to do this.
[75:49.03]Let's see if there is anything.
[75:54.91]Let me save it first.
[75:58.60]I like looking at the progress.
[75:59.60]It's cool.
[76:01.24]Let's see.
[76:01.70]Ready?
[76:04.68]Yeah, look at the left and then all the way to the right.
[76:06.40]14, 85, 129.
[76:08.38]Population slowly increasing.
[76:09.96]Cool.
[76:19.71]Okay.
[76:22.65]Uh, should I summon the giant crab?
[76:26.47]Gray goo?
[76:35.35]Do Crabzilla.
[76:36.75]Okay, where should Crabzilla spawn?
[76:45.01]Alright, good luck everybody.
[76:48.45]Wait, I control it?
[76:55.55]Well, I... Okay, well, this... They're all gone.
[76:57.83]Are you serious?
[77:05.77]I'm unstoppable.
[77:08.97]What?
[77:17.84]Nobody is going to stop me.
[77:18.94]I'm sorry.
[77:19.42]That's... How would they ever deal with this?
[77:33.76]Can I be killed?
[77:34.68]Okay.
[77:42.93]Alright.
[77:45.13]Oh!
[77:45.77]I didn't think that was going to happen.
[77:48.86]Sorry, AOTAID.
[77:53.46]Sorry, almost all of the Earth.
[77:54.74]They already took almost all the resources.
[78:04.03]What about here?
[78:07.79]Lava cloud?
[78:08.70]I'm curious.
[78:20.83]One person, one person is just like, holy shit.
[78:27.52]I don't even know what just happened, but I will rebuild.
[78:38.16]Good luck.
[78:41.06]That's determination right there.
[78:48.39]Alright, what else can I do here?
[78:49.37]How about, um... Earthquake.
[78:54.18]Where should I do it?
[78:58.14]Oh my goodness.
[79:03.08]Damn, okay.

[79:32.34]Really?
[79:36.12]Now you decide to go in.
[79:40.58]After all that.
[79:44.78]Was this seen as an opportunity of weakness?
[79:48.10]Where a bunch of this got wiped out, so they're like, alright, well, let's go in.
[79:53.16]That's kind of messed up.
[79:54.40]They have flaming swords.

[85:41.63]How dare you.
[85:42.11]Alright.
[85:48.51]That was World Box.
[85:50.53]That seemed kind of crazy.
[85:53.14]Let's move on to Pizza Tower.
[86:00.28]I did not know that that was going to do what that did.
[86:02.02]I thought it was just going to make some goo on the ground.
[86:05.76]That was fun.
[86:10.01]Tired of it?
[86:10.61]No, not really.
[86:11.20]I just, you know, I feel like if you wanted to really, really make a ton of kingdoms and stuff, I kind of, my brain is a little too small for that, but definitely fun to play.
[86:27.78]Alright, Pizza Tower time.
[86:37.28]How about sorcery?
[86:39.50]Uh, no plan for that right now.
[86:43.06]I gotta plug this in.
[86:44.20]Uh, yeah.
[86:50.12]Let me just close this.
[86:51.79]Give me one sec.
[86:52.79]BRB for two minutes.
[86:53.93]Or three minutes.
[86:55.81]Give me a sec.
