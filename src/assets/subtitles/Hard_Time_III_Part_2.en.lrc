[ve:60.16.100]

[00:34.51]Good morning.
[00:35.95]Good afternoon.
[00:42.00]Happy New Year.
[00:45.58]to where, where is it?
[00:47.06]Where is it?
[00:47.38]The new year right now is the new year right now for anybody in the world.
[00:56.01]Australia?
[01:05.74]What time would it?
[01:06.57]What day is it right now in Australia?
[01:08.93]Australia is plus 14 or something, right?
[01:14.31]It's gotta be a new year, right?
[01:19.01]I had to be live for the ball drop in Australia.
[01:25.50]This stream's gonna be 30 minutes.
[01:27.15]I'm only doing this to get to 100 streams this year.
[01:30.74]And I wanted to do it early enough, so it was North America, right?
[01:36.98]I'm just going live for maybe, maybe, maybe like an hour, maybe.
[01:44.49]99.1 streams, that's not how it's calculated.
[01:48.22]It's just, was this broadcast turned on, yes or no?
[01:51.92]And for at least 30 minutes.
[02:00.33]Hey, thanks for spending New Year's Eve with us.
[02:04.23]Well, okay, I'm one of those...
[02:05.51]Okay, I came to the party early.
[02:07.74]Like, you're throwing a New Year's Eve party.
[02:10.31]And I show up for 30 minutes.
[02:14.29]I eat a couple of the cocktail shrimp and I have a soda and I leave.
[02:19.82]So technically, I did come to your New Year's Eve party.
[02:22.29]You can't hold that against me later.
[02:28.01]What, a freeloader?
[02:31.00]Is it a freeloader if you eat two or three shrimp and leave?
[02:34.54]I feel like two or three shrimp is not a big deal.
[02:38.08]If I filled a Thanksgiving dinner type plate of food and then I left, then yeah, I could see what you're doing.
[02:46.99]but having one or two cocktail shrimp and a Sprite, I think that's fine.
[02:55.62]If I eat like one cookie off the tray, I think that's fine.
[03:06.25]What if that's all there was?
[03:07.83]Well, then that's a pretty dog shit party.
[03:11.71]And I'm glad I left.
[03:14.87]Happy New Year.
[03:15.75]Here's all the stuff we got for the party.
[03:17.56]We have four shrimp.
[03:21.98]That party sucks.
[03:22.88]I'm out.
[03:31.80]That's coward behavior?
[03:35.27]I'm sorry, I think looking for a good time on New Year's Eve... is not coward behavior.
[03:41.63]You're acting like it's going to build stats or something.
[03:46.69]No, dude, you got to stay and grind that out.
[03:48.16]You get like plus 10 strength.
[03:54.88]It's not worth, no.
[04:03.34]says the guy that's streaming for Stats right now.
[04:06.73]I'm not streaming for plus five agility.
[04:10.80]I'm streaming just to have a round number that I can go, look at that.
[04:16.38]I actually, hey, you know what?
[04:17.60]I was actually thinking about turning the stream off in 10 minutes.
[04:20.45]I was going to go live and just be like, alright, we got to 100 sealer.
[04:24.43]But no, it's got, to me, a stream.
[04:29.54]Like a live broadcast gaming or whatever.
[04:32.75]I think it's got to be 22 minutes at least.
[04:36.47]It's got to be at least one full episode of television.
[04:39.28]22 minutes.
[04:41.76]I think that's fine.
[04:43.01]After that, you're good.
[04:49.81]Or, you know, 44 is the hour-long episode on TV.
[04:56.36]But nowadays, that's a full 60 minutes.
[04:59.58]Everything is just commercial free now.
[05:06.28]22 minutes but 15 are spent on the orbit screen.
[05:08.84]Well, I'm telling you, that's not what we're doing.
[05:17.64]This is the New Year's special though.
[05:19.17]It has to be longer than 22 minutes.
[05:30.88]I'm just saying what I think is reasonably acceptable for...
[05:34.27]Okay, what about like a radio show?
[05:36.43]I've actually treated this stream like it was a radio program for the last 10 years.
[05:43.95]How long is a radio show?
[05:44.87]Like an hour or two?
[05:56.08]It's worth three.
[05:57.83]Up to three.
[05:58.27]Three hours.
[05:58.96]Five hours for... No, not for one single radio show.
[06:04.63]One hour radio show with 20 minutes of it being ads.
[06:08.91]Yeah.
[06:09.74]Or more than that.
[06:17.96]You've been sharing your screen the whole time just to let you know.
[06:21.54]Bro, are you serious?
[06:26.91]Yeah, I'm so sorry.
[06:30.00]Hey, let's talk about some exciting stuff for the new year though.
[06:33.37]Uh, so the, I'm going to give you the stream that's going to happen because now it's actually off the ground.
[06:40.48]And I'll give you kind of the rules.
[06:42.75]The rules are not necessarily final, but it should be fun.
[06:45.88]Alright.
[06:46.26]So I keep talking about this top 250 thing.
[06:48.69]Top 250 games of all time.
[06:50.85]Top 300.
[06:52.86]That's going to happen.
[06:54.46]I don't know exactly when it will happen.
[06:57.10]I know it's going to be probably in the next month.
[06:59.48]Maybe in the next few weeks.
[07:02.65]I just know that whenever it's ready, it's ready.
[07:05.41]Here's how it's going to work.
[07:07.34]There is right now.
[07:10.93]Why does this always happen?
[07:12.34]Every time I'm about to talk about something, it's like, hey, you sure you don't want a bunch of juices to be up in the back of your throat right now?
[07:18.41]You were about to talk for about two straight minutes.
[07:24.03]I can't do that on TV.
[07:26.76]If this was television, I would have been, I would have gotten fucking thrown off set.
[07:30.34]They would have been like, cut it.
[07:32.64]Go get a water and come back when you're ready.
[07:36.77]And then I would put a bathrobe on.
[07:38.16]I'd go to my trailer.
[07:40.21]I'd sit in there for like three or four hours.
[07:41.70]I'd watch fucking four or five episodes of SpongeBob.
[07:43.81]I would gargle some salt water.
[07:47.20]I'd slap my face a fucking few times in the mirror, throw some, get some witch hazel in my hands and put it on my cheeks.
[07:54.22]smoke a cigar, and then we would try again tomorrow.
[08:00.98]But I don't have that luxury.
[08:03.25]So here we go.
[08:06.77]So, over these next few weeks, we're gonna do something fun on stream.
[08:11.57]I keep talking about it.
[08:13.24]It will be over a series of rounds, and I don't know if it's going to be in one day.
[08:19.60]uh one of my mods who you've seen here probably before drew
[08:24.61]Drew is working on a website.
[08:27.87]But I think some other people here, too.
[08:29.74]I think he was talking about other people that he was going to work with it.
[08:34.92]The Drew Crew.
[08:40.16]Pretty cool.
[08:42.18]It's gonna be a...
[08:44.29]I don't think it's gonna be a officially kind of out there public site.
[08:49.65]I think in the early stages of trying to do this experiment, it's going to be just like a local only thing that I've run in my own browser.
[08:57.33]So, it's going to be over a series of rounds.
[09:00.03]Round one is going to be an elimination round.
[09:02.97]And we're kind of trying to make it so... You know those either-or websites?
[09:08.21]And I think maybe I've talked about this for like 10 seconds, but let's go a little bit deeper.
[09:11.96]Those either-or websites where it's, dude, it's, you gotta pick Britney Spears, like, oops, I did it again, versus, dude, fuck.
[09:20.94]Fucking corn?
[09:21.97]No way, this is gonna be so hard!
[09:27.54]Like which one was better to you or which one was more important to you.
[09:31.08]We're going to follow that philosophy.
[09:34.30]but it's on your own stuff that you know that you love.
[09:39.13]And I love a lot of things, apparently.
[09:46.35]Corn?
[09:46.98]Yeah, like the band.
[09:50.83]So the idea is that if I have, which I know I have, I have almost 300 of these.
[09:56.71]There's going to be a massive elimination round at the beginning without, you know, choosing either or.
[10:01.58]Then there'll be a series of...
[10:03.80]This one gets to kind of move on.
[10:05.79]Then they'll be in either or to end up at a final top 100.
[10:11.28]to put where they belong in a tier list.
[10:14.46]And this is all going to be on this...
[10:16.88]Because I was going to just do like a tier list, like tier maker for this, but I feel like it was way too elaborate to do.
[10:28.00]But I think the system is going to be cool.
[10:30.54]It's going to be a good system.
[10:33.86]Please make it a public website.
[10:37.52]Let's just get one done first.
[10:41.11]Then, I know at least one or so...
[10:43.80]There's a few people I want to see do this too.
[10:46.53]So you may see somebody like Ster or I'll bring it up to a few other people that I think might be interested in doing it.
[10:52.87]It takes a lot of work.
[10:55.60]It actually does take time.
[10:56.87]And I know I'm the guy that gives his friends homework.
[10:59.60]So at least Ster will be doing this, I think, after I do it.
[11:05.31]But let's make sure it's good and it works and it's fun.
[11:08.85]I'd rather be the experiment on that.
[11:11.96]You're the homework guy.
[11:12.85]I know.
[11:13.15]So let me, before I give everybody homework,
[11:15.84]Let's see if this is fun to do.
[11:17.45]And then it's like, okay.
[11:19.51]And then the thought is that maybe this could be, we could just release it just publicly.
[11:23.45]And then people could kind of do it on their own.
[11:27.87]Might be kind of fun.
[11:28.74]I don't know.
[11:33.94]Bro, you're still a teacher.
[11:34.99]Nothing shi- I was not a teacher, man.
[11:42.07]That's like saying that, no, I didn't throw for like 5,000 yards.
[11:49.39]I was, uh...
[11:51.20]I was like the callback to a callback to a callback I wasn't even on the team, man
[12:01.34]Where on your list is full English breakfast?
[12:05.45]I'd say zero.
[12:09.10]But yeah, I think it's gonna be a lot of fun.
[12:10.46]I've been, this is something I've been personally been working on internally for a few months.
[12:17.38]Does it feel like every like once a week or so I just kind of pick another console that I go, wait a minute, how many of these things that I actually like a lot
[12:24.59]And the goal is not to find the best game ever.
[12:30.43]Because I know that already.
[12:31.73]I already, I could tell you my top five, but I definitely don't know if I could tell you my top 30 through 100.
[12:37.84]And I think that's interesting.
[12:39.38]Or once it gets to the final part, am I full of shit?
[12:42.54]Is there really something that's more important?
[12:43.82]It's going to be three criteria.
[12:45.55]I know he's stalling.
[12:46.63]This is the fucking 40 minute New Year's Eve stream, man.
[12:49.22]This whole thing is going to be a stall into playing good boy for five minutes.
[12:52.50]So just bear with me.
[12:57.94]You've got gameplay.
[13:01.33]You've got importance.
[13:03.37]And you've got impact.
[13:04.98]That's the three criteria that any time I was looking at a game.
[13:11.08]What's good?
[13:12.73]Hey, what's good?
[13:13.61]What's up?
[13:15.58]Well, I don't know why I responded to you, but hey, what's up?
[13:19.04]What's good?
[13:22.20]How are you?
[13:23.59]I'm good.
[13:25.25]You alright?
[13:26.05]Happy New Year.
[13:30.40]What was I saying?
[13:31.11]What the fuck just happened?
[13:36.29]What just happened?
[13:41.57]What was I just talking about?
[13:42.98]That guy just mind wiped me.
[13:45.27]Why?
[13:45.63]Why did that comment just totally just delete everything I was just doing?
[13:51.13]Okay, top, look at the criteria.
[13:52.47]Thank you so much.
[13:53.52]What?
[13:53.68]That guy fucked me.
[13:55.85]My head.
[14:00.24]What happened to me?
[14:01.36]That guy had some fucking psychic powers.
[14:04.99]Okay.
[14:09.33]I was like, that guy fucked me up.
[14:11.87]Not the idea that he fucked me up.
[14:13.40]Look at how bad he fucked me up.
[14:15.08]I forgot to add the extra word at the end of that.
[14:17.52]I forgot to say the word up after that.
[14:20.81]Alright, anyways, criteria.
[14:23.94]Gameplay, importance, and impact.
[14:25.86]Gameplay is how good the game is, right?
[14:28.65]Like, it's just pure gameplay.
[14:30.80]how great a game is just because the video game is fun.
[14:35.80]Importance
[14:37.14]Importance, relax, everybody chill.
[14:41.38]Importance is how much did you think about it at the time?
[14:46.61]Was it part of your, how much did you, was it a big deal every day?
[14:50.27]Oh, I can't wait to do this.
[14:51.16]I can't wait to think about this.
[14:52.00]I can't wait to play this.
[14:53.11]How much did it actually stay with you during that period?
[14:55.98]How important was that game?
[14:59.96]And then impact is how do you feel about it now?
[15:04.97]And the criteria for a game even being on this list, and I fought with this, is I think impact.
[15:12.40]has to be at least a couple years, I think, have to go by.
[15:16.95]Right?
[15:18.15]You can't really say, like, for instance,
[15:21.76]I know that I look outside as one of my favorite games of the year.
[15:24.93]I know it's up there, but I think I don't know if it's allowed.
[15:29.43]I think a year or two has to go by.
[15:31.46]So I think this will end up being like as of like 2022 or like 2023.
[15:35.40]I might just leave it on.
[15:38.30]We'll see.
[15:41.08]How memorable is a game?
[15:42.85]Yeah, the impact to me is like memorable.
[15:44.62]Like if I think about it right now, or how many times have I gone back to it?
[15:47.73]How much of an impact
[15:50.14]did this actually have?
[15:52.40]That could be a Nintendo game, guys.
[15:55.83]And as I've gone back and looked at, and guys, there are almost 300 of these that have impacted my life.
[16:04.99]Hold on, let me turn the audio on.
[16:10.29]Incoming audio.
[16:14.78]So remember, the goal here... Why can I not move?
[16:24.18]What the fuck?
[16:26.97]Okay, there we go.
[16:27.82]Wait, why is my controller not working?
[16:31.62]Alright, El Nino Bueno Malo.
[16:33.57]That's you process your prisoner.
[16:35.28]I just made...
[16:35.93]Hold on.
[16:36.25]What's going on?
[16:38.36]Why can I not use the analog?
[16:45.43]Oh, and I think, by the way, the candle.
[16:47.46]You guys know the candle, the game, the candle?
[16:51.06]Uh, the dev, I think, gave a shitload of codes.
[16:53.24]I think there's a bunch of codes that- that we might just throw in the chat.
[17:01.93]Why can I not... Why can't I move?
[17:08.41]What's wrong with my character?
[17:09.62]Okay, my analog works here.
[17:13.25]But it does not work in the game.
[17:15.58]None of my buttons work.
[17:24.10]I think- do I need to get punched in the face?
[17:25.54]I'm just trying to be a good boy for once!
[17:32.51]Wait, your character is keyboard and mouse and you are playing as random other characters?
[17:38.53]You're in two-player mode?
[17:40.76]What are you talking about?
[17:41.91]Who am I controlling with the other character?
[17:43.63]What?
[17:48.03]How did I do two player mode?
[17:56.67]Okay, I'm going to have to restart the game?
[18:03.69]Let me try and just reboot it.
[18:07.71]That was weird.
[18:15.98]Press C when you're in the main menu.
[18:19.70]Okay, hold on.
[18:22.85]Continue.
[18:25.66]There we go.
[18:26.56]Alright.
[18:27.57]Alright, so anyways, yeah.
[18:28.88]The whole thing is to have... What is your most impactful game?
[18:31.67]What's your best gameplay?
[18:33.31]And that could be something... Dude, there's like...
[18:35.82]I have a shitload of Super Nintendo games on that list.
[18:41.41]It's gonna be interesting, that's for sure.
[18:44.23]Alright, so the whole goal here is I'm trying to be a good...
[18:46.45]Put that cigarette down.
[18:51.58]I'm picking up kind of where I left off as El Nino Bueno.
[18:56.06]El Nino Bueno.
[18:57.03]I can't even say the word right.
[18:59.06]I'm going to try to...
[19:00.02]I'm not doing any crimes.
[19:02.06]This is good boy any%.
[19:06.72]My cell is 10.
[19:11.24]Oh my god, that's a shitload of codes.
[19:13.37]Alright, the candle dev just gave away, like, you're essentially giving away the fucking game for free.
[19:18.91]How many codes is that?
[19:22.11]This is 50 game codes to the candle?
[19:32.64]Uh, alright.
[19:33.39]I don't know how we're gonna do 50 codes.
[19:35.82]Hey, Happy New Year.
[19:36.73]We're giving away 50 codes.
[19:39.68]I could just put them up on screen.
[19:42.29]Okay.
[19:44.17]Should I just put these images on screen randomly?
[19:46.88]Okay, it's split into three images.
[20:01.80]Okay, I'm gonna put I'm gonna put this this first one just up on the screen right now.
[20:09.23]There are... Oh my god.
[20:16.97]Alright, there are 17 codes on this image.
[20:26.00]Okay.
[20:26.79]Well, this is crazy.
[20:27.93]Fine.
[20:28.25]Let's go.
[20:33.54]Where do we type them in?
[20:34.68]I think these are for Steam.
[20:52.33]Okay, you guys ready?
[20:55.42]This is Steam codes 17 of them in a row here.
[20:59.84]For the candle.
[21:02.79]Pick a random user and whisper them.
[21:05.72]Maybe mods can do that after we do this.
[21:07.48]I think this is kind of funny for the first.
[21:08.79]There's like 50 of these guys.
[21:09.79]Don't worry.
[21:10.67]Ready?
[21:17.23]Go.
[21:18.96]Good luck.
[21:21.07]I don't even know if these work.
[21:39.00]Yeah, something about this feels weird.
[21:41.58]I feel like something wrong just happened, right?
[21:44.60]If this ever shows up on your stream, that's a problem, right?
[21:48.04]That something went horribly wrong.
[22:02.61]Somebody said one of them was an Elden Ring?
[22:05.32]What?
[22:05.58]One of them was an Elden Ring?
[22:09.56]No, that person's lying.
[22:17.76]Oh, but wait, okay, we're gonna do it a different way.
[22:20.17]Apparently you can fuck up your Steam account if you, like, spam codes.
[22:24.63]Alright, we're not doing that again.
[22:27.70]Alright, I did not know that.
[22:28.61]I did not know.
[22:29.05]If you, like, type in codes and you spam shit over, like, what?
[22:32.16]More than a dozen times?
[22:33.41]Oh, it's not permanent.
[22:34.23]It's temporary.
[22:34.96]Okay.
[22:37.39]Alright.
[22:37.61]Well, there you go.
[22:38.01]That was from the candle dev.
[22:39.02]Well, thank you, candle dev.
[22:40.03]And there's way more.
[22:40.91]That was so loud.
[22:42.97]I don't even know what happened.
[22:46.37]Bro you just crashed the Steam servers.
[22:50.48]That would be really bad if this amount of people could do that.
[22:54.75]Bring me a microphone by 2 o'clock tomorrow.
[22:56.88]Okay.
[22:57.64]I gotta be a good boy.
[22:58.61]Okay, time to get into my roleplay.
[23:00.98]Here we go.
[23:07.80]Where am I?
[23:08.50]What shall I buy in again?
[23:10.69]Oh, good evening.
[23:11.74]Slow down, L. Running may get you there quicker, but it also makes you tired.
[23:18.50]That is great advice.
[23:19.44]I'm gonna take a quick nap.
[23:28.08]Did somebody take my bed out of my room?
[23:31.56]You spelled bueno wrong.
[23:33.04]Oh, oops.
[23:35.23]Let me just use the toilet real quick.
[23:44.89]That's a weird image.
[23:54.44]Okay, looks like the mods are going to be randomly... Don't sleep.
[23:59.46]I get in trouble for that if it's not late enough.
[24:02.32]Come on.
[24:05.02]See?
[24:05.75]It's this guy again.
[24:06.50]I will find a way to get my revenge.
[24:10.20]Yeah, I think that the next like 40 or 30 of these codes mods are just gonna whisper random people.
[24:18.44]So hey, you could be visited by Santa Claus over the next 20 to 30 to 40 to 50 to 2 to 3 hours, however long this stream is.
[24:34.81]And I think they might do a game with some of them too.
[24:36.47]They might hide a few of the characters to make it harder.
[24:40.65]Alright.
[24:41.43]Let me get a fresh start.
[24:43.41]I just need to last 26 days.
[24:45.07]That's easy.
[24:46.95]Easiest thing I've ever done.
[24:54.94]Am I not strong enough to lift this?
[25:04.35]Really?
[25:11.02]Alright, if I go to bed now, I think it's good.
[25:14.92]But like they say, early to bed, early to rise.
[25:19.39]Is there an officer that can see me do this?
[25:21.62]Alright, let's go.
[25:33.16]Why did my cell just open?
[25:37.54]Is this the shortest you can make your character?
[25:39.12]Yes.
[25:39.70]This character is four foot six.
[25:45.43]Early to bed, early to rise.
[25:46.91]It's literally about to be 1 a.m. or what?
[25:50.14]That would be 12?
[25:50.64]12.01, right?
[25:54.72]Incoming?
[26:04.07]I already made it through one day.
[26:05.34]That's crazy.
[26:11.44]It was that easy just to... Well, actually, no, it wasn't.
[26:14.86]Alright, anything I can do just to get some...
[26:21.73]You made him your height?
[26:22.79]I made him at least one full foot taller than me.
[26:25.26]At least.
[26:29.86]Is this guy supposed to be in here?
[26:32.88]Hello!
[26:40.68]Dude, would you like to be friends?
[26:46.38]How do I get fr- how do I become friends?
[26:50.72]Do I even have a cellmate?
[26:57.26]This guy doesn't want to talk to me.
[27:08.65]Alright, well, I guess I'll go back to bed.
[27:10.01]Okay, he can sleep on the toilet this way.
[27:23.56]I failed.
[27:27.89]Oh, I guess it is 2 o'clock tomorrow.
[27:30.53]How would I do that if I'm not allowed to leave the cell?
[27:33.03]Don't break that.
[27:39.55]There's literally a microphone on the bed.
[27:42.36]What?
[27:51.30]Bro, you're gonna sleep through this whole run?
[27:52.79]It's been one day!
[27:53.80]I've never even got- What's the longest I've gotten to?
[27:55.85]10 days?
[28:00.95]What's up?
[28:01.40]What's going on here?
[28:10.74]Okay, here we go.
[28:18.42]Can you ever forgive me?
[28:19.66]Do you have any advice?
[28:21.57]Anything I can do for you?
[28:24.50]Uh, do you need any money?
[28:27.82]I don't want anything from you, Mallow.
[28:29.46]A mouse trap is the only place where lunch is free.
[28:36.31]That's an interesting take.
[28:47.61]I want full HP for the day.
[29:00.37]We live in a society, Mario.
[29:04.47]What do you mean Mario?
[29:11.30]Oh, he said mallow.
[29:12.57]I was like, where are you getting that from?
[29:17.85]Alright, it's almost time.
[29:19.26]Oh, I can't wait.
[29:20.23]Another exciting day in prison.
[29:22.36]Ow.
[29:24.68]First things first, a good morning, you need to get a good breakfast.
[29:30.81]And what do good boys eat?
[29:33.26]We eat a complete breakfast with whole grains, bananas,
[29:41.93]Maybe a muffin.
[29:53.49]Yeah, get the digestive tract moving, exactly.
[29:57.39]Maybe a nice, maybe six ounces of warm coffee.
[30:03.11]Not too much caffeine though.
[30:05.53]I don't want to get the gastric upset.
[30:16.34]How about one more little snooze before the day begins?
[30:30.21]Okay.
[30:35.59]Something you also wanted to talk about?
[30:36.96]Yes.
[30:37.52]Alright.
[30:37.74]We're about to start the day.
[30:38.75]I would like, do you want, do you need anything?
[30:40.94]Want me to get you something?
[30:43.68]You know, could you ever forgive me for doing nothing?
[30:46.01]We've been in here for one day.
[30:47.07]I don't even know who you are.
[30:49.54]I knew you'd come crawling back.
[30:50.79]That just proves I was right to stay away from you.
[30:54.90]Pleased to meet you for the first time.
[31:11.35]Okay, oh, here we go!
[31:12.82]It's like when they drop the ropes at Disney!
[31:26.03]What an exciting day.
[31:30.37]There's so many things I could do, so many people to see, so many adventures to go on.
[31:37.63]At eight o'clock sharp, the gates open wide.
[31:45.55]Watch my stride!
[31:56.14]Oh, hello, officer!
[31:57.14]Your time is up and it looks like you failed to do as I asked.
[32:01.89]I apologize.
[32:05.50]All that matters is I'd make it 25 more days.
[32:17.52]What cigarette?
[32:30.97]I guess I'll start the day with something.
[32:32.05]This person's going to attack me.
[32:34.81]Oh, a protein-filled breakfast.
[32:37.40]Isn't that delicious?
[32:40.60]Hey, you guys noticed that every single meal now has protein in it?
[32:47.16]Have you guys noticed that?
[32:47.93]Why do you think that is?
[32:48.83]Does anyone have any idea?
[32:51.47]Every package now says, plus 20 grams of protein.
[32:54.90]Hooray.
[32:55.32]Why?
[32:56.63]Why?
[33:07.72]Actually, why?
[33:09.85]Only the last, like, year or two?
[33:10.93]It's just... Oh, look, it's a...
[33:14.34]Look, this is milk with added protein.
[33:16.93]This is cereal with a bunch of protein in it.
[33:18.72]These are potato chips, but they have a bunch of protein in them now.
[33:21.27]What's with the protein?
[33:24.47]Like, pill.
[33:25.48]I don't get it.
[33:30.86]It's good for focus.
[33:33.09]Don't you just eat it?
[33:34.34]Just eat food.
[33:38.47]Just eat food.
[33:40.42]Just eat like chicken or like tuna or steak.
[33:43.07]Like, I mean, it's just proteins in like every food.
[33:48.74]I don't really want a bunch of protein injected into everything else I eat.
[33:56.47]Like I don't want, yeah, I don't want like broccoli injected protein.
[34:00.02]Like that sounds weird.
[34:03.85]I guess, yeah, if you're a vegetarian or something, yeah.
[34:05.73]But if you're, I mean, I don't know, I don't really need like 500 extra grams of protein a day if I'm already eating protein.
[34:19.02]Like, if I eat a chicken sandwich and then I eat a bag of chips that's like, whoa, with 40 grams of protein, makes you get that protein kick.
[34:27.36]That's too much.
[34:32.21]People think protein equals healthy.
[34:34.22]Is that what it is now?
[34:35.08]Alright.
[34:38.92]I've not had any issues at all today.
[34:41.49]I'm gonna go read a book.
[34:51.10]Ooh, a present.
[34:51.82]Is this allowed?
[34:59.20]It says here the weather has been forecast to snow in winter.
[35:04.93]Wow.
[35:07.38]There's snow in the winter.
[35:09.01]That's unbelievable.
[35:11.27]It says here you can dash by double tapping in any direction.
[35:14.90]I've got to give that a try.
[35:17.25]Ow, my ankle!
[35:25.83]Let's... Let's not do that again.
[35:27.92]Is that Mario?
[35:35.83]What is that fucking Mario book?
[35:40.94]Is this Super Mario?
[35:45.30]There's a hole in here?
[35:52.99]Oh, I'm going to turn this end to the police.
[35:58.08]Excuse me, officer.
[35:59.07]I found this.
[36:03.47]Oh, I injected it.
[36:09.56]Oh, I don't feel good now.
[36:13.31]I don't know what was in this.
[36:19.91]It's fashionable to have a syringe.
[36:22.26]Okay.
[36:22.50]Well, I guess I'm going to carry it around.
[36:23.81]A backpack.
[36:33.44]Any other controllers that are connected can press Start to take control of a character.
[36:37.38]Well, thanks for telling me that.
[36:43.77]That's actually really funny though, is you could just sabotage everything that your friend is doing.
[36:50.72]Be careful who you welcome into your life.
[36:56.65]Allies will follow you from one place to the next, whereas potential enemies will be kept at a distance.
[37:06.72]Okay.
[37:09.03]He thinks he's in a video game.
[37:11.72]Yeah, that's very interesting, Needles.
[37:13.27]But video, we're in real life.
[37:20.58]What the heck?
[37:30.02]Let's go!
[37:32.34]Wait, give me the broom.
[37:33.04]I want to clean.
[37:34.69]It's about one o'clock in the afternoon.
[37:40.79]Cleanliness is godliness.
[37:50.21]How do I clean?
[37:52.78]Can I clean?
[38:01.38]The gesture buttons?
[38:03.31]Yeah, why am I just holding it weird?
[38:07.07]Oh, I have an idea!
[38:09.10]Could I have that camera?
[38:11.99]So I can document what's going on in the prison.
[38:22.15]You broke the window?
[38:22.98]That was not a good thing?
[38:23.98]It was fine.
[38:29.70]Uh, can I have that?
[38:31.98]Can I have that camera?
[38:35.78]Please do take this camera off my hand.
[38:37.16]Seems like you need it more than I do.
[38:38.29]Alright.
[38:43.23]I'm going to make a documentary film titled On the Inside.
[38:52.75]I gotta get footage of everybody.
[39:04.54]Alright, it is a struggle to not, like, punch somebody in the face.
[39:07.66]I'm trying to just live, alright?
[39:09.95]I'm trying just to get through one sentence.
[39:21.97]This really is playing the game in hard mode.
[39:25.45]Oh, blood!
[39:27.22]That's perfect to show.
[39:28.64]I'll start with the intro.
[39:29.46]That'll be part of the intro.
[39:34.16]Could I get everybody to stand over here with me?
[39:36.17]And do some introduction interviews?
[39:43.78]Andrew?
[39:50.92]I'd appreciate if you could do me a favor.
[39:52.73]Oh, this is gold!
[39:54.14]What do you want me to do?
[39:55.39]Say it under the camera.
[39:58.04]You need to stay away from an inmate known as Karen Mahoney.
[40:01.98]And what is, what's going on with Karen Mahoney these days?
[40:05.48]See if you can make it to zero-zero without being seen by her.
[40:09.63]Treat it like a horror movie.
[40:13.53]Wow.
[40:13.63]What brilliant direction.
[40:18.74]Hello?
[40:25.50]I can't believe they moved me to cell two of the north block.
[40:31.63]Who is this?
[40:33.98]And why did you call this number?
[40:43.21]Wait.
[40:51.18]Hello?
[40:52.88]El Nino Bueno Malo, did you ever ask yourself who got you locked up for trolling?
[40:58.29]I've never asked that question.
[41:00.14]Well, you're too stupid to ever know who or why until I make it painfully clear.
[41:10.38]Perfect music cue.
[41:14.06]Alright, so don't be seen by this person.
[41:15.47]What if I just hide?
[41:17.08]I'm just gonna hide.
[41:23.04]Who was it?
[41:23.78]Karen?
[41:26.00]I'll hide in the hospital.
[41:33.73]Oh, wait!
[41:37.57]It's my brother!
[41:39.06]Gooder boy!
[41:39.83]I thought you were dead!
[41:42.63]Remember, you're on a mission to avoid being seen by Karen Mahoney.
[41:45.77]Okay, that's fine.
[41:47.20]I've got a ghost.
[41:48.99]Todd Fahrenheit has been imprisoned in cell 10 of the West block for nothing.
[41:53.04]Okay.
[42:01.21]I thought you were dead!
[42:05.59]We have to be friends!
[42:06.36]I have to be friends with this guy.
[42:07.63]I gotta be friends.
[42:08.90]Let me help you.
[42:09.40]We have to stick together.
[42:10.21]We're the two good boys!
[42:15.67]Yes, yes, I want... Is there something you want to say to me?
[42:18.42]Oh, nino, bueno, valo.
[42:22.84]Of course there is.
[42:25.57]Uh...
[42:27.44]He's in a group called Sons of God.
[42:31.00]Would you like to be friends?
[42:33.94]It's embarrassing that you would even ask.
[42:36.17]Stay away from me, you creep.
[42:40.71]My older brother always was giving me a hard time.
[42:54.89]I got to hide in here, though.
[43:03.97]I think I did it right?
[43:04.61]0-0?
[43:08.54]Come on, El Nino Bueno Malo.
[43:10.03]Didn't you hear the buzzer?
[43:10.83]Get back to the south block.
[43:13.87]I'm heading there.
[43:14.72]I'm heading there.
[43:15.42]Ow.
[43:16.99]Whoops.
[43:26.80]Oh, there she is!
[43:34.07]Would you be willing to sell that backpack for $16?
[43:36.20]Are you kidding me?
[43:37.06]Yeah.
[43:40.82]Absolutely.
[43:41.48]You can have this backpack for $16.
[43:49.02]Wait, my camera's in there.
[43:50.05]That camera's worth like a hundred bucks.
[43:51.69]Oh, shit.
[43:54.32]Is that her?
[43:56.21]No.
[43:59.32]I need to hide.
[44:00.60]I'm just gonna hide right here.
[44:02.61]I did it.
[44:08.77]Are we your excuse to RP?
[44:10.73]Yeah, actually.
[44:12.22]I don't have as much fun if I talk like this, if I'm just in my room by myself.
[44:22.54]I mean, if I was recording it, maybe.
[44:23.89]Alright, so I gotta go to South Walk.
[44:28.42]Ooh, I have nine bucks to make a horror movie.
[44:36.43]But I lost the camera though, I'm sorry.
[44:42.99]Alright, get back, get back, get back.
[44:45.95]I'm going, I'm in, look.
[44:48.69]Okay.
[44:50.16]Make a quick defecation.
[44:52.83]What are you doing up late, El Nino Bueno Malo?
[44:55.40]You need to get a good night's sleep.
[44:57.02]What is he doing?
[45:08.96]So far, so good.
[45:10.31]Day four.
[45:19.57]Uh...
[45:21.34]Careful?
[45:27.77]kill hodge I'm I'm not I'm good this is good boy percent I'm not doing anything
[45:36.06]I have to beat my previous PB, which is, what, 8 days?
[45:39.00]10 days?
[45:44.24]A good boy would not let revenge get a hold of him.
[45:49.87]A good boy would...
[45:54.45]Put this down before I get any ideas.
[46:00.84]I'm gonna go to the yard next and play some basketball.
[46:02.95]That's what I'm doing all day tomorrow.
[46:07.06]I want to give this guy a wedgie so bad.
[46:10.93]Why?
[46:11.17]Because he's obeying the rules.
[46:21.12]Let the demons come out to play.
[46:27.18]No, I'm making it to day 10 without a single issue.
[46:32.51]Let's put some on it.
[46:35.54]Put something on it.
[46:39.61]Put your money where your mouth is if you don't think I'm gonna do it.
[46:42.34]Hey mods, do a prediction bet.
[46:45.50]That will I make it to day 11 with this character?
[46:49.70]Because the answer is yes.
[46:51.00]I'm going to do everything possible to be as good as possible.
[46:53.57]I'm not going to get in any trouble.
[46:54.45]I'm not going to fight anybody.
[46:55.32]I'm not going to hurt anybody.
[46:57.96]Will I make it to day 11?
[47:04.40]Wait, no it's not time yet.
[47:10.85]Oh, no.
[47:12.17]Don't wait, please.
[47:13.42]Don't kill me.
[47:14.31]We didn't even do the bet yet.
[47:23.06]Oh, I just got a...
[47:24.95]In one instant, I just got way less confident.
[47:27.76]It took a fraction of a second to lose all confidence, but I think I can do it.
[47:36.43]Day 11 without going to court or without dying?
[47:40.29]Um, no, without dying.
[47:41.34]Without dying.
[47:41.86]Going to court.
[47:42.44]I could get arrested for dumb shit in this game.
[47:46.52]Make it day 11 without dying.
[47:54.63]Oh, you know what?
[47:55.42]No, you know what?
[47:57.08]No, I ain't going to court either.
[47:59.07]Will I make it to day 11 without a single fucking issue?
[48:02.61]I'm going to get there.
[48:04.14]I'll give you that one.
[48:08.19]This is get to day 11, PB without a single issue.
[48:15.74]And by the way, issues can be resolved.
[48:25.25]Refund and do it again?
[48:26.36]That's fine.
[48:27.61]We can clarify it.
[48:28.26]Refund and do it again.
[48:30.14]Will I get to Day 11 without a single issue?
[48:33.26]An issue means I go to court and I am convicted.
[48:39.32]You understand?
[48:40.65]If I go to court and I'm off, then that doesn't not count.
[48:47.79]Day 11 without getting convicted or dying.
[48:51.83]There you go.
[49:00.25]see me walk around without running either.
[49:12.92]Okay, we're going out to the yard.
[49:14.23]I'm just staying out of any bullshit.
[49:16.70]I'm not touching anything.
[49:17.64]I'm getting there.
[49:18.41]We're being good boy any%.
[49:25.21]I'm gonna eat cheese on the ground, whatever this is.
[49:28.04]What is that?
[49:28.36]Those are bullets.
[49:28.97]Nope.
[49:30.08]Nice bait.
[49:43.60]If you do this, I genuinely, I will never out-doubt ever again.
[49:50.56]I'm just gonna hang out.
[49:52.77]I'm not doing anything.
[49:55.26]I'm gonna twiddle my thumbs for eight straight days.
[49:58.22]Telephone.
[50:11.17]Alright, stop ringing.
[50:25.01]sit in here all day.
[50:26.64]I'm going to sit in here all day.
[50:27.68]I'm not moving from this spot.
[50:31.97]Oh, a telephone.
[50:36.03]You don't know who I am, but I know who you are.
[50:38.10]I'm coming to get you, El Nino!
[50:41.80]Bueno!
[50:44.50]Oh.
[50:45.25]Well, that was quick!
[50:52.89]That's fine.
[50:54.44]I disagree.
[50:55.36]And let me tell you, I don't know how I'm talking to you, but I disagree.
[50:59.91]You know, Wrestling Revolution 2D is the longest reigning sim on any store.
[51:05.93]I didn't know we were going to get an ad.
[51:07.11]Okay, well, thanks for the ad.
[51:09.54]I'm getting out of here.
[51:16.31]I'm going to the cafe.
[51:17.35]I'm going to go to the bathroom.
[51:18.20]I'm going to use the bathroom and I'm going to go to the cafeteria.
[51:21.31]I'm going to eat food and we're going to bed early.
[51:31.92]I'm not taking any drugs?
[51:37.04]I'm just gonna...
[51:38.08]I'm just gonna be...
[51:41.50]Do not.
[51:49.10]These are so high.
[51:51.92]I thought it was something you can do to keep yourself busy.
[51:56.37]What do you want?
[51:56.95]Didn't this person try to kill me?
[51:58.40]Deliver a banana to the prison yard.
[52:01.03]Uh, okay.
[52:06.56]You've got it.
[52:13.08]Well, there's an apple and there's a banana right there.
[52:19.39]Got it.
[52:20.40]Let's go.
[52:21.22]Quest complete.
[52:28.43]How did I get back in this?
[52:40.30]By 17, right?
[52:47.36]That's my seat!
[52:48.68]Get up before I sit on you!
[52:51.42]Oh, well, I... My goodness.
[52:56.46]You can absolutely have this back.
[52:59.65]That's right, this throne belongs to the king.
[53:01.48]You should sit at my feet to show some respect.
[53:05.94]No, don't eat the banana!
[53:13.79]Is it okay if it's half-eaten?
[53:19.51]Alright, I got it.
[53:24.22]Ah.
[53:26.23]The outside world.
[53:30.16]I remember what my life used to be like when I was out there.
[53:35.70]I was somebody.
[53:42.54]One day I'll get back out there.
[53:54.80]I think somebody just got struck by lightning.
[53:56.90]Did somebody just get struck by lightning?
[54:07.42]What is going on out here?
[54:11.35]There's a fire out here.
[54:13.14]This is unsafe.
[54:14.39]I need to get out of here.
[54:15.05]This is not good boy.
[54:16.72]This is bad boy stuff.
[54:19.51]Don't touch me.
[54:21.48]I have to get out of here.
[54:22.84]They're gonna ask me to... Yeah, I'm the guy that has to clean up after everybody's messes.
[54:36.79]Somebody said I can train on this, can't I?
[54:49.19]Oh my God.
[54:50.47]I gotta get out of here.
[54:52.56]I'm a witness to a horrible thing right now.
[54:55.34]Oh no, I can't go to court because they're going to convict me.
[54:57.49]I didn't do anything.
[54:58.98]I had nothing to do with any of this.
[55:11.04]I want to get a view though.
[55:15.71]Yeah, I can't.
[55:16.25]I can't go to court.
[55:17.32]I'm not going to court.
[55:22.63]We're gonna play some video games.
[55:30.05]Does he not want to play?
[55:36.67]See if I can get the high score.
[55:45.53]I'm just gonna play video games all day.
[55:56.60]None of these games are Robocop.
[56:06.36]Do I get anything out of this?
[56:11.86]Nice work, L. That will get your sentence down to 25 days.
[56:16.16]trying to beat that high score for months now.
[56:19.28]Thank you.
[56:19.66]I'll show you how it's done.
[56:29.76]for playing video games.
[56:38.44]Oh, it's for the banana.
[56:39.54]Okay.
[56:45.19]What was the arrest for?
[56:45.99]It was for trolling.
[56:50.65]Uh.
[56:56.09]Why did that guy have a gun pointed at me?
[56:59.55]What the fuck am I doing?
[57:07.14]What am I doing?
[57:10.66]I'm just raring to go after that massive gaming session.
[57:13.29]Um, no, everything's fine.
[57:17.59]Uh, do you know who did this to me?
[57:22.27]Sorry, I don't know anything about that.
[57:24.10]Perhaps you should ask somebody else.
[57:29.94]Okay.
[57:35.00]Alright, let's get back to it.
[57:36.23]This can be a dangerous place on your own, but I can shadow you if you pay me $7.
[57:39.67]I actually am going to say yes.
[57:45.48]That is not a high price.
[57:47.18]And if somebody attacks me, he'll go to jail.
[57:57.97]That's a great deal, yeah.
[58:00.56]I'm going to go to the hospital because I'm going to eat something I find on the ground.
[58:06.74]Let's get to full health.
[58:10.10]Let's go pee in the urinal
[58:15.96]When you get overstimulated, the adrenaline rush can make you 10% quicker and stronger.
[58:20.12]Okay.
[58:24.19]You just have to watch out for the adrenaline dump on the way down.
[58:31.30]Okay.
[58:33.41]Thanks for the advice.
[58:38.03]You ever figure out who locked you up?
[58:40.54]I can tell you that their name is Jim Warr.
[58:45.12]What?
[58:46.45]What do you mean, you found out?
[58:50.33]Jim Warr, you say, huh?
[58:53.27]Why don't we go pay a visit to Jim Moore right now in his cell?
[59:01.71]Didn't this guy just say he had no idea?
[59:10.90]Where's Jim Warr?
[59:13.28]Alright, that's the goal tomorrow is to find Jim Wharf.
[59:16.88]Eddie Schwarz has been imprisoned in cell seven of the South Block for copyright infringement.
[59:22.84]Okay.
[59:32.99]You see a gym war.
[59:35.13]We gotta talk.
[59:47.74]Back to the cells.
[59:52.72]Dangle.
[59:54.53]Oh, there's good boy.
[60:00.60]What?
[60:02.86]What?
[60:08.51]Don't forget that my name is El Nino Bueno Malo.
[60:13.93]Do me a favor, okay?
[60:20.46]We need to speak to a civilian called Ken Ryu.
[60:23.62]How am I supposed to do that?
[60:27.90]you think you could start a conversation with him by six o'clock no he's out of prison
[60:40.59]You just gave me a task that is not completable.
[60:45.37]Alright, let's go to bed.
[60:46.52]I gotta find Jim Warr.
[60:50.62]Don't sprain an ankle.
[60:57.23]Alright.
[60:58.16]Block 10?
[60:59.08]Yep, yep, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[61:15.31]What are you doing?
[61:15.87]What are you doing?
[61:16.49]No, no, no!
[61:16.81]I'm going to bed!
[61:17.27]I'm going to bed!
[61:17.75]I'm going to bed!
[61:18.82]Where's my buddy?
[61:20.32]Where's my buddy?
[61:20.82]I need help right now!
[61:22.21]Where's my buddy?
[61:22.93]I need help!
[61:23.45]Come on!
[61:23.73]Get over here!
[61:24.26]Help!
[61:26.88]Get in here!
[61:27.51]Do you see what's going on?
[61:30.63]Put the cigarette down and get the fuck in here!
[61:34.58]She's trying to kill me with a screwdriver, Eddie.
[61:37.05]Come on!
[61:37.60]Eddie.
[61:38.99]Eddie.
[61:42.68]I paid you $7 for no reason.
[61:50.30]I paid that guy seven bucks to smoke a cigarette while I got stabbed in the back of the head with a screwdriver.
[61:54.16]Great.
[61:56.37]Leave me alone!
[61:57.22]I just want to sleep!
[61:59.91]Please.
[62:04.83]No, I can't defend myself.
[62:06.72]I can't defend myself.
[62:07.84]Please help me.
[62:10.50]It's my prison.
[62:11.99]Anyone who gets in my way will regret it.
[62:13.71]Alright, Eddie.
[62:16.76]Can you just please stand right here for a second?
[62:23.51]You did absolutely nothing.
[62:25.00]Thanks a lot.
[62:31.34]Yes, protect me!
[62:35.65]Can you give me some money?
[62:36.41]Do you need some money?
[62:37.06]Shall we form a gang?
[62:38.64]Let's form a gang!
[62:42.40]It would be great if we could get more people to join.
[62:44.21]We just need to...
[62:45.33]I thought he just ripped his face off.
[62:47.70]I thought he ripped his skin off his face.
[62:52.93]Okay, okay, good, good, good, good.
[62:54.41]Alright, fight, fight, fight, fight, fight.
[62:56.10]Fight back.
[62:58.55]I can't help you.
[63:00.12]I'm sorry.
[63:02.58]I don't want to buy a hammer for $8, but I guess I will.
[63:13.48]Thank you, appreciate it.
[63:15.07]I just high-fived this guy.
[63:17.00]Well, thank you.
[63:18.72]Alright, we need a name for our gang.
[63:22.69]That's fine.
[63:23.52]You actually should hold that.
[63:25.97]We need to sleep, dude.
[63:27.44]Alright, a name for the gang.
[63:28.63]How about...
[63:31.93]The...
[63:34.91]The...
[63:35.78]The good boys.
[63:36.66]The best boys.
[63:37.92]The best...
[63:39.97]The good ones.
[63:42.54]Good boys.
[63:45.07]The good fellas.
[63:49.98]Okay, you don't have time to talk.
[63:51.19]You better stay alive because I need you to help me.
[63:57.41]What are you even doing?
[63:58.17]Get out of here.
[63:58.73]I need to go to bed.
[64:00.00]Close my cell, please.
[64:01.23]I'm too weak to lift the bed up.
[64:04.35]Oh my god.
[64:11.18]I'm wanted for conspiracy as a fellow member of the gang.
[64:13.46]Could you take the heat for me?
[64:14.89]No!
[64:16.03]No, because that breaks the... No!
[64:20.47]This is your problem, dude, not mine.
[64:22.20]You're just as bad as them, El Niño Bueno Malo.
[64:26.53]If anything happens to me, then it's your fault.
[64:30.08]That would count as a conviction, wouldn't it?
[64:34.28]Can I just please get some sleep?
[64:48.07]My bed needs to be fixed.
[65:01.57]Okay.
[65:03.33]What did I fail?
[65:03.96]Day four.
[65:08.58]We're going strong.
[65:17.44]Oh, talking to Ken Ryu.
[65:19.27]Right.
[65:25.99]Alright, today...
[65:29.41]What do I want to do today?
[65:35.32]Let me go to the visitor center.
[65:39.53]Go lift weights until you're strong enough to fix the bed.
[65:41.99]That's actually not a bad idea.
[65:56.26]Holy shit, that guy's unloading on everybody.
[66:02.66]Okay, I'm sorry, jock laser.
[66:14.30]No, this is my friend!
[66:15.46]No, you need to leave.
[66:19.66]I need to feed him.
[66:20.80]How do I feed him?
[66:22.15]He's gonna die!
[66:24.07]Don't kill him, please!
[66:25.41]Can I help him?
[66:29.68]What if I give him some money?
[66:33.84]Oh my god, he unloaded on you.
[66:35.85]Are you good?
[66:36.37]Wait, why are you in a different prison?
[66:40.01]He got switched to a different block.
[66:49.30]Yes.
[66:50.24]Let me help you.
[66:51.69]Can I give you some money?
[66:53.21]Can I give you some...
[66:54.10]I didn't do that.
[66:54.64]You did that.
[66:55.62]You just broke, did you break your wrists?
[66:57.91]Could we be a family again?
[67:03.12]I knew you'd come crawling back.
[67:04.46]What do you mean?
[67:08.44]I want to...
[67:14.29]Were we not a family?
[67:15.90]I don't know.
[67:16.46]He hates you now.
[67:17.47]I know.
[67:18.01]Do we even have a gang?
[67:26.32]Maybe I should join the Joker's gang.
[67:32.07]Do you ever figure out who locked you up?
[67:33.76]I can tell you that they wear headwear, too.
[67:37.21]Yeah, headwear.
[67:37.83]They're called gym wore.
[67:44.71]Why did you just try to kick me in the face?
[67:47.42]What was that for?
[67:56.74]This is weird.
[67:57.73]We may not like each other, but there's something you could do to change that.
[68:00.85]Alright, what do I do to fix this?
[68:05.20]You're too stinky to serve.
[68:07.21]Oh, I thought you're too skinny to survive in prison.
[68:11.35]I need to gain weight.
[68:12.96]Do I just go eat a bunch of food?
[68:32.40]I gotta go eat a ton of food.
[68:36.67]Fatty stuff too, like hamburgers and stuff.
[68:40.32]Not vegetables.
[68:41.44]Meat.
[68:42.00]Give me the meat.
[68:42.84]Burgers.
[68:45.53]Remember, you're on a mission to...
[68:46.54]I know.
[68:46.76]Alright, I'm 95 pounds.
[68:52.84]More.
[68:53.35]I need hot dogs.
[69:03.32]Okay.
[69:07.60]You can start fires by pressing taunt and pick up together.
[69:09.77]That's good.
[69:18.10]I need to run this off.
[69:19.45]But don't burn the calories, just burn the puke meter.
[69:26.23]Okay, I can eat again.
[69:38.42]Give me that steak.
[69:49.01]We'd like to switch things up right now and again.
[69:50.55]You're in cell 12.
[69:51.70]That's fine.
[70:04.47]I gotta, like, do flips and stuff, right?
[70:07.28]Looking for... You're looking for Whack Oz.
[70:09.53]I saw him in the East Walk.
[70:10.39]I'm not.
[70:11.53]Do dumbbells instead?
[70:13.16]Won't dumbbells make me lose weight?
[70:17.09]I want that burger.
[70:28.77]Alright, I'm gonna go lip weights.
[70:39.98]Come on, gain some more weight.
[70:42.18]Give me that steak.
[70:48.48]Give me that snake on the ground, please!
[70:50.61]Got it.
[70:54.99]Okay.
[70:57.06]Uh, let me lift the weight.
[71:01.31]Strength 51.
[71:02.25]I was so low.
[71:02.89]100 pounds.
[71:06.08]I did it.
[71:10.74]Let's go.
[71:16.27]105 pounds.
[71:25.49]That's my stake.
[71:26.42]Stay away from it.
[71:45.97]115.
[71:51.48]Oh, wait, I'm looking for a gym.
[71:56.92]War.
[71:59.51]I don't see a gym war.
[72:08.30]Okay, now I'm gonna go talk to...
[72:12.79]There he is.
[72:14.14]You did better than I thought, Al.
[72:16.03]Maybe you're not so bad after all.
[72:21.46]Okay.
[72:24.53]So now we need to get a name for our game.
[72:38.25]Yes, would you like to join my gang?
[72:42.07]Sure, I'd love to join your gang.
[72:43.13]You won't regret this.
[72:43.94]Good.
[72:44.80]Alright.
[72:45.48]Now we're in the gang again.
[72:46.57]I'm gonna deuce a favor for him.
[72:53.80]That guy's got dynamite.
[72:55.24]He's got cartoon dynamite.
[72:56.39]This is a dangerous place, but I hope you found my support useful.
[73:00.44]I need to take care of something on my own.
[73:02.01]Okay.
[73:02.15]Alright.
[73:02.45]Alright.
[73:02.67]We're not going to push this.
[73:05.81]Let's not push it.
[73:10.73]No, can you paint?
[73:15.73]Can I actually paint?
[73:20.38]Oh shit!
[73:32.59]Alright, I'm losing strength here.
[73:40.98]You said you're only going to stream for 30 minutes?
[73:43.23]Or one run of the Good Boy arc?
[73:46.85]Which we're currently still in it.
[73:52.13]I need to go sleep.
[73:54.74]Wait, I'm at west block, right?
[74:08.79]Wait, am I in West Block?
[74:10.76]I got moved, right?
[74:13.55]Let's get along.
[74:14.24]I think my friend is digging a hole in the ground.
[74:22.34]You're not trying to escape already, right?
[74:26.54]Just hold off on that for now.
[74:27.71]And why are you not in my clothes?
[74:32.82]Alright, that was a nice- that was a nice bro hug.
[74:36.36]What was that?
[74:39.17]We did that for one second.
[74:43.08]That guy is the worst friend to have.
[74:44.64]He's too erratic.
[74:51.53]Alright, don't eat anyth- this could be somebody else's material.
[74:55.69]Don't eat that.
[74:58.74]What was that?
[74:59.44]Are you alright?
[75:03.06]Slow down.
[75:04.10]Alright, alright.
[75:04.68]Well...
[75:07.68]I kind of want that shovel, though.
[75:09.50]I want... Bring the shovel in here.
[75:28.47]Wait, you just saw Jim Warr?
[75:31.29]Really?
[75:35.69]Henderson?
[75:39.83]Is that him?
[75:47.36]Wait, it is you.
[75:49.72]I just want to talk to you I know you put me in here
[76:02.44]Do you know who... Do you know who did this to me?
[76:06.78]Sorry, I don't know... Oh my god!
[76:16.68]Well...
[76:18.03]I'm gonna poop my pants, I'm gonna poop my pants!
[76:20.55]Please, I can't get arrested for pooping my pants, please!
[76:31.50]Do I even have a bed?
[76:32.23]I need more comfort.
[76:46.27]Alright, we're at day five.
[76:47.98]We're pretty much halfway there.
[76:57.34]So far, we haven't really had any close calls either.
[77:11.59]We're gonna go lift weights.
[77:21.06]See if I can get any more gang members, right?
[77:24.56]What's up?
[77:26.62]Yep, we're buds.
[77:29.75]What about the PUBG guy?
[77:32.76]The guy with the backpack.
[77:34.15]Excuse me.
[77:34.65]Excuse me.
[77:41.21]I thought I saw- You!
[77:46.47]No, I'm not starting a fire in the south block!
[77:51.93]No, I don't care.
[77:52.91]I don't care if you don't like me.
[77:56.01]That's going to get me a conviction.
[78:04.08]I'm just gonna get stronger every day until I have 99% strength.
[78:09.10]And I'm gonna be insanely powerful, and then that's the time to break out.
[78:22.89]Please get away from me.
[78:27.76]Is there no weights in here?
[78:34.08]Can I punch the bag?
[78:36.41]Please get off of me.
[78:38.05]I'm not gonna fight back, just...
[78:40.46]This guy with the wheelchair.
[78:42.67]Alright, alright, I've had enough.
[78:44.51]I've had enough.
[78:47.02]Oh shit, please get off me!
[78:49.75]Help!
[78:50.27]Somebody please get him off me!
[78:52.66]Get him off me!
[78:56.67]Ricochets.
[79:02.06]I just want to sit.
[79:03.09]Please get the fuck away from me.
[79:07.39]Officer Cooper.
[79:12.01]I'm not fighting back.
[79:31.15]What does this do for you?
[79:41.11]Oh, my health is low.
[79:42.22]Hold on.
[79:42.79]Get me out.
[79:49.58]Shoot a rocket launcher at the fence.
[79:51.67]A bad boy would do that, but that's not El Nino Bueno.
[80:14.60]What am I doing?
[80:16.81]Why am I sleeping?
[80:19.09]I'm getting up.
[80:19.57]I'm getting up.
[80:20.01]I'm getting up.
[80:20.33]Apparently I fell asleep.
[80:29.03]Get up, stop.
[80:30.08]Okay, I don't, the falling, I'm going to pee my pants.
[80:32.97]Hurry, where's the bathroom?
[80:40.84]You can get arrested for that.
[80:48.85]What's up, buddy?
[80:53.62]Any schemes we can do?
[80:58.98]You ever figure out who locked you up?
[81:00.79]Well, I can tell you that their head shape is big nose and jaw.
[81:05.71]I already know who it is.
[81:21.41]Hmm.
[81:27.01]You need to leave the gang.
[81:29.86]Protect me.
[81:34.14]Okay, he's got my back.
[81:36.81]Can we be more than friends?
[81:49.12]Remember, you're on a mission to start a fire.
[81:50.94]I'm not doing that.
[82:05.17]Am I eating this?
[82:07.46]No, you can't eat it.
[82:13.52]I'll take the health kit, though.
[82:19.51]I'm wanted for escaping.
[82:20.76]As a fellow member of the gang, could you take the heat for me?
[82:23.34]No.
[82:24.43]This guy keeps getting into trouble and then making me bail him out.
[82:26.81]And now he's going to leave the guild.
[82:30.55]No.
[82:37.16]Is that why he's in the bathroom?
[82:38.64]Hiding in the bathroom?
[82:44.62]Well, dude, you should take this.
[82:47.57]Oh, that's why you're in here.
[82:51.24]Oh shit, he's going back to jail.
[82:53.80]Wait, we're in jail already.
[82:59.88]What can I do for him?
[83:03.02]Alright, is anybody looking?
[83:04.17]Is anybody looking?
[83:11.54]I killed him!
[83:14.37]I killed him!
[83:14.99]I think I killed him!
[83:15.94]I think I killed him!
[83:17.83]I think I killed him!
[83:18.87]I think I killed him!
[83:21.24]Nobody saw that though.
[83:27.05]No, he's alright.
[83:28.22]He's alright, he's alright, he's alright.
[83:34.54]Oh my god, I killed him!
[83:36.55]Oh my god, I have to be in a different room.
[83:39.43]I have to be in a different room.
[83:40.39]I have to be way far away from every...
[83:43.23]I have to go all the way to the other side of the block.
[83:45.62]All the way.
[83:47.80]Somewhere where I need an alibi.
[83:49.53]I have to be so far away.
[83:50.75]No, he's here.
[83:51.22]He's fine.
[83:51.48]He's fine.
[83:52.22]He's fine.
[83:52.50]He's fine.
[83:53.10]I still have to be far away.
[83:55.95]Like, excruciatingly far away.
[84:01.27]I'm going to bed.
[84:06.64]I've been in here the whole time.
[84:28.61]Almost day six.
[84:29.52]We are actually halfway there now.
[84:32.00]More than halfway.
[84:38.39]huge come on don't you hear the buzzer go oh well it's gonna it's about to buzz right now
[84:46.34]I wait, are they talking?
[84:47.95]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[84:49.69]Yap has been found.
[84:51.46]We're investigating the incident.
[84:53.33]And ask anybody with information to come forward.
[84:56.52]Nobody saw me do that though, right?
[85:02.02]I think he died.
[85:05.55]Are he's dying?
[85:06.25]That's not good.
[85:11.81]As long as they can't tie it back to me, I'm fine.
[85:19.92].
[85:21.07].
[85:25.22].
[85:28.83]I punched him once in the head!
[85:31.91]I punched him once!
[85:34.72]What if I- if I sleep, will my- will it go away?
[85:42.82]See, I was just in my bed.
[85:44.17]I was in my bed sleeping.
[85:45.27]I was in my bed sleeping.
[85:58.09]They don't have a case at all.
[85:59.62]There's no case.
[86:03.75]What happened?
[86:06.38]The guy wanted me to take the fall three times and I literally punch him once and he dies.
[86:13.65]No, no, no, no.
[86:14.54]This is absolute bullshit.
[86:15.98]Refuse to follow orders.
[86:17.11]No, no, no.
[86:18.42]I'm not even getting in trouble for killing that guy, by the way.
[86:21.03]I'm getting in trouble for sleeping too early.
[86:23.85]That's what's going on.
[86:33.38]Yes!
[86:36.17]We're still good.
[86:39.70]This was not even for killing the guy.
[86:42.36]I got insubordination because I slept an hour early.
[86:49.50]We're good.
[86:51.27]Alright.
[86:59.76]Isn't he still alive though?
[87:00.92]There may not be any justice in this world, but I'll get you one day.
[87:06.20]That's fine.
[87:06.82]Whatever.
[87:09.80]Why are there so many people in this cell?
[87:16.68]Why am I sharing a cell with this many people?
[87:40.63]I'm kind of nervous to get up because I feel like I don't want to bump into anybody that hurts me.
[87:46.62]It's now ca- no, see what I mean?
[87:48.09]That's why I'm getting- I went to bed so early.
[87:58.78]No!
[87:59.97]I didn't do it!
[88:00.57]I didn't do it!
[88:01.14]I didn't do it!
[88:01.76]I didn't do it!
[88:02.30]I didn't do it!
[88:02.81]I didn't do it!
[88:03.39]I just cartwheeled it and it opened.
[88:07.93]I'm not moving from this spot.
[88:11.73]That was way too close of a call to even think about moving.
[88:26.09]pretending to sleep.
[88:26.98]That's fine.
[88:28.51]I will pretend to sleep.
[88:39.23]I'm not doing shit.
[88:48.89]You're the worst cellmate.
[88:51.13]You see what happens when I actually get up and move around.
[88:52.80]Fine.
[88:55.57]Somebody else can sleep in the bed.
[88:58.59]I'm just gonna sit right here.
[89:13.49]If the guy you killed lives, you have to marry him.
[89:17.32]I didn't even kill anybody.
[89:23.53]I merely...
[89:25.70]I...
[89:26.61]I struck him in the back.
[89:29.47]As a...
[89:31.24]I can't believe I punched that guy once and killed him.
[89:35.44]Like, can we be real?
[89:36.41]That's absolutely ridiculous.
[89:37.91]And nobody saw it
[89:39.46]So if he lives and he tells on me, that's bad.
[89:48.13]This actually could be a scenario where I have to hitman level kill this guy.
[89:56.27]We'll see if he makes it.
[90:12.69]There are too many people in this cell.
[90:16.15]What did I do?
[90:17.94]Failed?
[90:26.17]I guess I could sleep on the ground.
[90:31.14]That was pretty sick.
[90:31.97]Whatever that that was cool.
[90:37.26]That wasn't me that did that!
[90:40.22]I didn't touch anything.
[90:41.02]This person has a knife.
[90:42.27]I don't have a knife.
[90:49.98]Oh, the fire.
[90:52.96]What are you looking at?
[90:53.77]I'm... resting.
[91:00.26]Thanks for the tip.
[91:07.70]It's funny that tutorial messages can show up to random people as dialog after playing the game for 10 plus hours.
[91:26.74]Okay, am I asleep?
[91:30.87]Maybe I slept too much.
[91:41.21]Alright, we're at day six.
[91:45.46]Gonna go back out to the yard and I'm gonna lift weights again.
[91:50.60]It's not time!
[91:51.80]I'm not out.
[91:57.88]I don't know who keeps opening this, but it's not me.
[92:11.89]They're sleeping.
[92:12.78]That's okay.
[92:13.50]It's eight o'clock.
[92:14.18]I'm up.
[92:14.60]I'm up.
[92:15.63]Look at the people in the cell that are asleep right now.
[92:18.24]And you come after me.
[92:19.24]And I'm going to get power.
[92:24.25]What about the people, the insubordination in the cell?
[92:26.50]Look at all these insubordinations.
[92:29.17]Insubordination, insubordination.
[92:38.72]Alright, give me some food.
[92:44.48]Congratulations on beating that case.
[92:47.65]Why do I look like you, but in the future, after I've got like all beefed up?
[92:58.48]Maybe that is me.
[93:00.77]No?
[93:01.74]You figured out who locked you up?
[93:03.30]I can tell you they don't have any facial hair.
[93:04.85]Stop giving me hints.
[93:05.75]I know who it is.
[93:09.39]I know who it is.
[93:10.27]Your time is up.
[93:14.41]Looks like you failed.
[93:18.77]Uh-huh.
[93:21.86]Yeah, sorry I didn't start a fire in one of the... No.
[93:26.08]A fire gets me arrested and gets me convicted.
[93:28.13]No.
[93:30.78]I'm gonna eat some shit and I'm gonna bring some- The same fucking lady!
[93:35.28]Get out!
[93:36.30]You made me spill my corn!
[93:47.00]These people are naughty.
[93:52.02]Alright, I want a backpack so I can fill it with food.
[94:06.91]Here we go.
[94:12.10]How much do I weigh now?
[94:12.80]120.
[94:20.97]The attitude is getting better, too.
[94:22.20]That's good.
[94:22.56]125.
[94:31.67]Good.
[94:37.08]Look at the muscle.
[94:37.59]The muscle mass is starting to build up.
[94:39.05]I'm starting to get some some mass here.
[94:56.02]Alright.
[94:57.55]It's not time to sleep quite yet.
[95:06.01]Apparently it's... No, that's not happening.
[95:09.73]It's backpacked by the soccer ball.
[95:20.96]Oh shit, I didn't even know that was a backpack.
[95:22.89]Alright, I'm gonna fill this with food.
[95:25.65]And I'm taking this back to the cell too.
[95:28.08]I'm gonna carry this around.
[95:31.79]I'm not paying you anything.
[95:33.95]Sorry.
[95:35.72]Shove it up your ass.
[95:39.54]Ha ha ha!
[95:46.56]This guy can hear the conversation.
[95:47.85]That's why that happened.
[95:48.51]Alright.
[95:48.75]No, you're fine.
[95:49.81]It's the same lady again.
[95:52.53]She won't ever leave me alone.
[95:56.47]Wait, what just happened?
[95:57.57]Why am I under arrest?
[95:59.64]Wait, wait, what just happened?
[96:02.61]I was trying to run.
[96:03.83]What did he say?
[96:05.88]He said, I hit you by mistake.
[96:09.08]Oh, yeah, yeah, don't worry about it.
[96:10.26]But can you get the cuffs off of me?
[96:15.20]Don't point that gun at your head.
[96:21.10]Literally, my hands are behind my back.
[96:24.94]This is not good.
[96:27.63]I'm staying up here.
[96:28.31]I'm staying away from the crowd.
[96:31.82]Oh, I got out.
[96:33.64]Just eat the food.
[96:34.81]Eat a bunch of food and then store it.
[96:43.87]When there's this many people in a room, they all start fighting each other.
[96:46.70]That's just what it is.
[96:50.47]I want nothing to do with this.
[96:54.01]There is a bomb there.
[96:55.71]No.
[96:56.00]Do not... No.
[97:00.91]I don't give a shit.
[97:02.12]I'm staying over here.
[97:11.51]Alright, I'm gonna put the fish away.
[97:12.63]There we go.
[97:18.82]Alright, I don't want the broom.
[97:22.85]How many things can I put in the backpack?
[97:24.01]Just one?
[97:31.10]Okay, you can only hold one item in the backpack.
[97:54.49]I'm not gonna do anything with it.
[97:55.99]I just want it for later for something.
[98:05.68]That's a bad boy?
[98:08.63]I'm... You're right, I gotta get rid of that.
[98:12.30]Alright, but if I...
[98:14.25]I gotta put the backpack down, actually.
[98:16.33]How do I put the backpack down?
[98:18.30]Because I'm afraid of throwing this now.
[98:25.57]No, it has to stay in the backpack.
[98:27.02]Otherwise, if that comes out, I'm gonna throw it accidentally.
[98:30.27]Alright, I'm gonna go lift weights again.
[98:33.32]Do not...
[98:44.47]I don't see a weight anywhere.
[98:47.18]Unfortunately.
[98:50.08]Does this thing count?
[98:57.96]Stay away from me.
[99:15.05]Maybe a cigarette.
[99:15.77]Should I keep it for later?
[99:27.17]Phone.
[99:30.56]Other phone?
[99:32.75]Well, okay.
[99:33.18]Good thing I hung that up.
[99:39.89]You look like a little boy on his first day of school.
[99:43.48]This thing is huge on me.
[99:52.55]I'm looking for a dumbbell.
[100:00.24]That's fine.
[100:01.16]I didn't get convicted.
[100:01.98]I don't care.
[100:12.14]Finn Flanagan has been imprisoned in cell 2.
[100:16.12]For misgendering?
[100:17.74]Wait, what?
[100:23.16]Wait, he was arrested for that?
[100:32.20]Lock his ass up.
[100:46.19]Woke wins.
[100:58.56]Don't shoot me with a sh- Oh my god, this guy's shooting me with a shotgun.
[101:07.17]Why can't I get out of here?
[101:24.89]I thought of something you can do to keep yourself busy.
[101:36.78]I can't deliver a handgun.
[101:44.63]It's a fucking weirdo.
[101:48.17]This is the biggest bait campaign I've ever seen.
[101:50.58]This is total entrapment.
[101:54.72]Right at his feet, putting his hands behind his head like that.
[101:57.34]No, dude.
[101:58.58]Ain't gonna happen.
[101:59.85]You can put it in the backpack?
[102:11.80]I have to leave, now!
[102:14.45]What, does he want me to put it?
[102:18.20]What does he want me to put it?
[102:19.05]I-I-I wasn't paying- What do I have to go?
[102:20.99]What do I do with it?
[102:22.35]I need to put, I need to throw this away.
[102:25.86]Where's the gun?
[102:28.95]Ah!
[102:29.52]I didn't put this in my backpack, please!
[102:36.49]Where does it need to go?
[102:40.74]Where does it have to go?
[102:41.79]Where does it have to get delivered to?
[102:44.14]Cell block?
[102:44.83]Five?
[102:45.79]North block?
[102:58.56]How do I throw?
[102:59.04]How do I put it down?
[102:59.74]Does that count?
[103:02.67]Cell block five.
[103:03.74]Oh, fuck.
[103:05.65]Oh.
[103:13.83]Show me, show me, show me how to get there.
[103:24.87]Just follow me.
[103:25.65]I got to fail that mission.
[103:41.35]Bad time.
[103:58.74]I love the retired streamer with 20-minute streams.
[104:12.64]Hey, I did say it was gonna be up to three hours.
[104:16.62]And I'm on a roll right now on the good boy at any percent.
[104:28.10]Well, I can't leave the cell because I don't want to get arrested for insubordination.
[104:35.79]I nearly killed somebody.
[104:37.03]No, actually...
[104:39.47]I punched somebody once.
[104:41.72]Guys, I have... Let me explain something to you.
[104:45.78]Maybe if you need to be...
[104:46.52]This has to be explained to you.
[104:49.01]Two days ago, I shot a rocket launcher at a guy 15 times with 15 different missiles.
[104:55.29]And he lived.
[104:56.51]He was actually fine.
[104:57.33]I didn't even kill him.
[104:58.90]I punched that guy in the back one time and he died.
[105:04.72]The scale of how much damage...
[105:07.47]I mean, yes, he already was dying.
[105:10.19]I may as well just walked over and just kicked him in the head.
[105:13.20]He was already dead.
[105:14.79]He was already dead.
[105:17.17]And by the way, he's also still alive.
[105:25.47]He lived, you gave him brain damage.
[105:27.34]No, he's...
[105:30.31]He's fine.
[105:42.55]Oh.
[105:50.57]You stuck salt in an open wound.
[105:52.67]I did nothing.
[106:02.24]He died because he had one health.
[106:07.26]Didn't you get the memo that it's not cool to use the right kick attack?
[106:10.53]I don't even have a kick in my
[106:14.48]I don't have a kick.
[106:15.49]I have literally a punch.
[106:16.60]I don't kick.
[106:23.25]Look.
[106:24.30]I have regular punch.
[106:27.05]See?
[106:30.50]I'm hip.
[106:31.04]I'm in.
[106:31.50]I'm hip with everything.
[106:42.73]Normal consecutive punches.
[106:48.94]That's true.
[106:53.78]Hey, look what day it is.
[106:55.83]Think of all the doubters that are here.
[106:57.12]That are shitting their pants right now.
[107:00.41]That thought we were going to get arrested on day three.
[107:05.31]What an unbelievable New Year's Eve treat this will be to the believers.
[107:09.60]This will be the second time that I deliver to the believers twice in a row.
[107:12.81]Big time.
[107:15.85]I have to make it three more days and I'm done.
[107:22.11]Well, you did murder that guy.
[107:25.35]Well, that has not been proven.
[107:29.25]Uh, I have, that guy, what was his name?
[107:34.90]Because he's alive!
[107:36.63]We can go visit him!
[107:40.27]Why are they both ganging up on me about this?
[107:41.84]They probably talked about this last night.
[107:43.19]This is like a weird intervention they're having.
[107:47.53]Apparently you guys had plenty of conversations about how I kick too much.
[107:53.28]When I've kicked once.
[107:54.85]Probably the whole game.
[108:05.48]Uh... Can you give me...
[108:10.49]Uh...
[108:11.71]Okay, wait, wait.
[108:12.21]I can select this already?
[108:13.40]What?
[108:19.45]Didn't I just meet this person?
[108:21.80]Okay, well...
[108:28.94]It's 8 o'clock, right?
[108:29.97]We're good.
[108:30.52]I'm going to the yard.
[108:46.45]No thanks.
[108:56.82]Okay, give me some heals.
[109:01.18]If there's a med kit in here, I'm gonna store it.
[109:06.11]I'm on my way to the backstage area if you need a ride.
[109:09.68]Wait, where are we going?
[109:10.63]Backstage?
[109:12.29]What do you mean back?
[109:14.44]Have I been such a good boy that I get to do something fun?
[109:16.10]It's a trap.
[109:27.16]Ah, he's saying he wants to take me outside of the prison.
[109:34.44]I'm sorry, I can't do that.
[109:43.14]What if he's just carrying around a riot shield?
[109:48.08]Okay, let's take...
[109:52.27]Pizza.
[109:54.29]Store that.
[109:55.68]Banana.
[109:58.00]Okay, I've got tons of fruits and vegetables and shit.
[110:00.32]I'm ready to level up my game here.
[110:18.27]Alright, give me a dumbbell.
[110:25.92]Really?
[110:26.34]Look at how prepared I am for this.
[110:37.46]Can I have that apple?
[110:38.71]This is my workout.
[110:42.45]This is my pre-workout.
[110:47.92]Get your own apple.
[110:50.29]It's my pre-workout.
[110:55.60]Will the other way do it?
[110:58.59]Let me see.
[111:04.16]I shit my pants!
[111:09.76]to shit in the corner or someone's gonna arrest me.
[111:13.43]Oh, should I run to the bathroom?
[111:19.02]I need both of these.
[111:23.73]Too much pre-workout.
[111:25.99]Ah, too much pre-workout.
[111:27.10]It's a lot of protein.
[111:28.00]It's a lot of fucking fats.
[111:34.46]Okay.
[111:35.67]Alright, I'm fine.
[111:38.16]Hey, you only get in trouble if somebody sees it.
[111:41.88]Does this count?
[111:42.38]Can I use it?
[111:51.76]Doesn't count.
[111:59.72]You can lift it with the right stick if you press up.
[112:09.09]I'm at 60% strength.
[112:13.09]Is it true that you're a member of a gang?
[112:15.26]Yeah, it is.
[112:15.70]What of it?
[112:20.72]Wait.
[112:23.44]You trying to get me to join your gang?
[112:32.06]I got nothing to do with that gang.
[112:37.46]Gangs have been ruining lives, okay.
[112:49.64]61.
[112:50.26]I'm taking this with me by the way.
[112:54.75]I'm bringing this to the cell.
[112:57.84]because I'm going to sleep and then work out, sleep, and then work out, sleep, and then work out until I have 100% strength.
[113:13.77]I'm going to take a med...
[113:14.72]Okay, if there are medkits on the ground too, they'll come with me.
[113:26.34]Let me get a medkit spawn.
[113:33.23]Eh, whatever.
[113:41.60]What even?
[113:41.96]What is that?
[113:42.68]A peach?
[113:47.20]Buy pills from the doctor?
[113:48.55]Yeah, but I could just sleep too.
[113:51.79]Heard you crapped yourself.
[113:53.26]I tried not to do it.
[113:54.09]Well, yeah.
[113:54.55]Well, as long as an officer didn't see it, I'm fine.
[114:10.05]Wait, this is the lady that always beats the shit out of me.
[114:20.53]Leave me alone!
[114:21.47]I just... didn't mean to hit her.
[114:28.64]But I did.
[114:29.44]Accidentally.
[114:34.37]El Nino Pansos Sharto.
[114:37.56]Oh, no.
[114:39.48]I can't go to that.
[114:44.51]This soon after, wait, I need this.
[114:48.33]Okay, there's nobody in here.
[114:49.64]Just do it in here, shit in here, quick.
[114:54.53]Do it quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[114:56.84]Come on, do it.
[114:58.49]Okay, we're fine.
[114:58.95]Good, good, good, good, good.
[115:00.72]Give me out, give me out, please.
[115:04.79]Okay, I don't think anybody saw that.
[115:06.83]Thank God.
[115:11.36]El Nino Banzo Chardo.
[115:15.49]That's so stupid.
[115:16.76]That's so dumb.
[115:18.99]That's the stupidest thing I've ever heard.
[115:25.28]Anybody got anything in here I can take?
[115:26.65]No, we gotta go west, right?
[115:35.71]This is all new to me, so I don't want to upset anybody.
[115:38.02]I need all the friends I can get.
[115:39.47]I don't give a fuck.
[115:42.72]Why are you telling me anything?
[115:47.33]I got way more important shit I have to do.
[116:03.70]I'm glad they moved me to cell 12 of the... And you know what's so weird about this game?
[116:09.41]Why...
[116:12.01]Oh my god.
[116:13.57]I thought they were saying that I got in trouble for shitting my pants.
[116:18.37]That's me.
[116:18.93]That looks like me up there, doesn't it?
[116:23.85]because that was an embarrassing photo.
[116:25.43]I was like, oh no.
[116:32.00]Okay, what's weird is, why do they tell me that?
[116:36.70]Oh, I just want to let you know, I got moved to cell block 12.
[116:40.32]It's just like, I don't even know.
[116:41.69]I don't even care.
[116:42.25]Like, why do you need to tell me that?
[116:44.00]It's so bizarre.
[116:45.28]It's so funny.
[116:46.91]Alright.
[116:49.16]Go be productive.
[116:50.26]I'm about to be.
[116:58.19]The goal is to not get seen sleeping by anybody, any officer.
[117:02.97]So then I get double the amount of workout time in the cell.
[117:08.77]Which I think I can do it again.
[117:09.66]I'm going to get...
[117:11.33]There's no officer, right?
[117:12.15]No, we're good.
[117:14.22]Okay, here we go.
[117:14.66]Perfect.
[117:19.30]Well, goodbye.
[117:19.91]Thank you, Eddie.
[117:22.05]I'm in the wrong cell?
[117:23.94]Isn't this 12?
[117:27.78]Did you guys just lie to me?
[117:32.94]I don't even use that move.
[117:34.91]Shut up, everybody.
[117:36.04]Leave me alone.
[117:44.92]Alright, here we go.
[117:50.37]You should be making fun of me for shitting my pants three different times out of my underwear onto the ground.
[117:56.39]Then he uses right kick!
[117:59.29]Haha!
[118:00.56]They care more about that than me pooping my pants.
[118:06.83]Alright, here we go.
[118:07.47]It's workout time.
[118:24.24]I just crossed 150.
[118:33.20]And I got the weight in my backpack too.
[118:45.92]Then we go to bed, wake up, do it again.
[119:04.84]It's already 8 o'clock.
[119:11.49]He's not looking yet.
[119:12.35]He's not looking yet.
[119:13.38]He's mad at that person for staying asleep.
[119:15.53]He's pissed off.
[119:16.28]He's aiming the gun at them.
[119:18.09]He's taking a long time to get up.
[119:19.77]The guy slept with his basketball.
[119:21.54]I'm up.
[119:24.37]Well, I mean, I get it.
[119:24.98]I slept with my weight.
[119:34.88]165 dude, I'm getting big.
[119:47.08]Day 8 Doubters sweating
[119:54.86]Okay, I need food.
[119:56.95]I'm not going to sleep because I could get arrested for that, so...
[120:04.07]It is almost the end of the day.
[120:10.42]I could just go...
[120:14.87]Dude, the doubters are screwed now.
[120:22.30]Sleep in the hospital?
[120:27.14]I just have to make it to...
[120:28.48]Does nobody attack me until eight?
[120:30.80]Wait, I have like actually five hours.
[120:33.27]Let me go to the hospital.
[120:34.83]Just wait.
[120:35.84]I get attacked and I get hurt.
[120:37.32]Somebody could kill me.
[120:39.94]That is a dangerous walk to the hospital.
[120:45.82]Okay.
[120:46.20]I'm out.
[120:46.50]I'm out.
[120:46.79]I'm out.
[120:46.99]I'm out of the cell.
[120:47.53]Look.
[120:49.27]No!
[120:56.48]This is so dangerous.
[121:04.53]I know, thank you.
[121:05.72]Appreciate it, Luke.
[121:08.60]Luke Cannon.
[121:15.05]Actually, I am getting kinda jacked.
[121:22.13]Hospital.
[121:25.69]It's this guy.
[121:29.04]The goal is...
[121:31.63]to get to day 12, right?
[121:34.67]Cause it's, I gotta get to at least 11 or 12 and then hit man level, get this guy.
[121:47.75]I'm frozen in fear right now.
[121:49.17]I don't know.
[121:50.44]Why is this guy being weird?
[121:54.97]Get away from me with the gun.
[121:56.93]I need to go to the hospital.
[122:03.53]I just need to lay down in the hospital bed.
[122:05.42]Alright we're good.
[122:12.91]I was like, no way.
[122:16.89]Buy meds from the doctor?
[122:22.43]You're increasing my sentence.
[122:23.80]Great.
[122:25.40]Thank you.
[122:44.01]Yep.
[122:45.64]You can escort me if you want.
[122:46.72]That's fine.
[122:50.12]Oh, she didn't say escort.
[123:01.87]This is the most dangerous walk back.
[123:03.67]Do not.
[123:07.14]Don't body block me.
[123:08.10]I'm getting in my cell.
[123:09.97]Don't shoot me.
[123:12.23]I'm in here, look!
[123:22.37]She's been in here blow-drying her hair for four days!
[123:38.72]Day nine, here we are.
[123:47.63]This is my girlfriend, right?
[124:00.07]Yeah, it's not big enough for three people, you're right.
[124:05.50]How about you move out so we can feel... No, you have to leave.
[124:13.09]No, it's you.
[124:14.08]You move out, not me.
[124:17.53]You won't walk out, then I'll just have to make sure they carry you out.
[124:20.10]That's fine.
[124:21.04]Good luck.
[124:26.71]Okay, fine, yeah, come over here.
[124:28.62]Come and attack me.
[124:30.89]Prisoner about to attack!
[124:33.30]Where the fuck did he go?
[124:35.69]What?
[124:36.29]Oh, okay.
[124:40.48]He baited me.
[124:41.77]He literally tried to make sure I didn't see him.
[124:43.27]Look!
[124:43.76]Prisoner!
[124:44.12]Prisoner fighting!
[124:45.42]Prisoner fighting!
[124:46.33]Officer!
[124:46.67]Prisoner fighting!
[124:48.78]Prisoner fighting!
[124:51.69]Prisoner fighting.
[124:59.74]Do you hear me getting punched in the face?
[125:13.93]Let's talk.
[125:23.33]I want our relationship to increase.
[125:35.82]Let's form a gang.
[125:42.72]Wait, is people joining my gang putting on glasses?
[125:50.15]She's just like a nerd now.
[125:58.83]We gotta get more nerds.
[126:03.62]Um, can I have that hair dryer?
[126:05.41]Cause it's really annoying.
[126:12.32]Thank you.
[126:18.54]Alright, we're good.
[126:26.41]It's not cool to be in a gang.
[126:39.27]Shut up, loser.
[126:40.65]I run this part of the block now.
[126:46.94]Let's see if we can get this guy in.
[126:50.76]Didn't anybody warn you how unfashionable it is to be in a gang?
[126:53.20]You're in the gang.
[127:00.29]We're one of two people.
[127:03.17]You're 50% of the entire gang.
[127:11.85]You want to join?
[127:13.88]Let's get every single person in this block on the game.
[127:17.08]Every single one.
[127:25.94]Would you like to join my gang?
[127:29.68]Fine.
[127:32.72]You know who'll do it?
[127:35.59]I know who'll do it.
[127:38.70]This guy.
[127:39.21]This tank top guy.
[127:41.73]Eddie!
[127:43.04]We gotta talk.
[127:54.87]Wanna join the gang?
[127:58.60]Okay, fine.
[128:00.79]What about this guy?
[128:02.02]Harry Weiner.
[128:10.85]Okay.
[128:11.71]Why do you have plain clothes on?
[128:13.95]I got in trouble for that when I did that before.
[128:21.60]Alright, so I'm gonna get everybody in here.
[128:28.02]At least half these people are gonna be on my game.
[128:33.07]Hey.
[128:35.12]Join us.
[128:36.89]And then we're going to break out of prison on the 12th day.
[128:41.41]Or the 13th day.
[128:47.04]That's fine.
[128:48.54]Yeah, left behind.
[128:56.27]She's trying to attack.
[128:57.88]Fuck, I got stabbed in the mouth with a syringe.
[129:01.23]Oh, it was dirty.
[129:03.03]It was dirty.
[129:05.74]Oh!
[129:16.78]Why are you trying to break out of prison?
[129:29.10]You want to join the gang?
[129:39.05]Why is it people can't forgive me?
[129:42.32]What did I do wrong to anybody?
[129:45.97]Alright, this- all the plain clothes people have not been affiliated yet.
[129:50.68]So, they'll all join.
[130:01.83]Everybody hates me.
[130:02.58]We're going to go to the other block.
[130:03.55]I have a reputation here.
[130:04.34]Everybody hates me.
[130:11.99]What's wrong with this guy?
[130:24.60]Alright, the guy with the glasses is already halfway there.
[130:26.30]I'm gonna ask him to.
[130:29.53]Can you ever forgive me?
[130:33.14]There we go.
[130:35.36]Perfect.
[130:37.75]Now I'll ask him.
[130:54.82]That guy's name is Officer Awesome.
[130:59.32]Hey, when you're done strangling that guy, do you want to see if you want to join the guild?
[131:17.13]Okay.
[131:27.25]Oh, fine, whatever.
[131:28.66]All you chumps.
[131:31.40]Okay, 22 to 8.
[131:37.94]What about Clark Bologna?
[131:45.37]Your character's not cool enough.
[131:47.94]Well, then this guy's perfect.
[131:53.08]Can I join body bag?
[131:54.44]No, join my gang.
[131:55.84]My gang's cooler.
[131:56.63]The good boys.
[131:58.91]Fine, whatever.
[131:59.60]Alright, I'm going to bed.
[132:10.15]180 pounds.
[132:15.84]Somebody got really hurt.
[132:22.82]Who got that hurt?
[132:25.61]Oh, this guy.
[132:26.29]What happened?
[132:29.65]Grant Slater is almost dead.
[132:35.13]This is a perfect opportunity.
[132:38.97]Join the gang.
[132:39.51]We'll protect you.
[132:49.13]Yep.
[132:49.86]In the state you're in right now, you need some help.
[132:51.48]You need some support.
[132:52.12]You need some friends.
[132:59.65]Join us.
[133:02.42]You guys are already in a dumb guild.
[133:07.10]Oh yeah?
[133:10.12]You haven't even downed Onyxia yet.
[133:14.24]We're in competition for top 20 guilds for world first Molten Core.
[133:19.47]Let that sink in.
[133:34.46]He's trying to punch me through the wall.
[133:47.49]How do you interact like that?
[133:50.85]Is it just like once every few minutes?
[134:06.52]It's one of the taunt buttons.
[134:13.00]You were supposed to get shredded every day.
[134:15.40]Look at me.
[134:15.74]I look great.
[134:22.10]You don't think I can get shredded right now?
[134:24.40]Look at this.
[134:30.62]Come on, hold it up.
[134:40.34]I'm gonna sleep with it on my chest.
[134:42.72]Build some more muscle.
[134:48.78]Okay, uh, I need to make it through one more day.
[134:52.59]And that's, that's GG.
[135:08.57]What's he doing?
[135:13.98]I'm just trying to use the weight.
[135:16.45]Why can't I...
[135:17.37]I'm holding up to taunt.
[135:18.62]Why is it not working?
[135:22.02]Huge throw incoming.
[135:23.32]No, actually, you're wrong.
[135:31.77]Try to have a child with her?
[135:32.98]It's demented.
[135:38.62]I don't know how to do that.
[135:52.33]Oh, can I have that?
[136:00.73]Can I have that?
[136:02.20]Where are you taking that?
[136:06.82]Give her some money.
[136:07.64]Give her some money?
[136:17.72]Are you kidding me?
[136:18.69]I need to...
[136:19.39]I can't...
[136:19.89]I'm sorry.

[142:32.86]Okay, what block is it?
[142:36.38]Is it true that you're the member of a gang?
[142:38.07]Oh my god.

[143:42.84]No, not again.
[143:44.39]I thought it just locked me out.
[143:48.10]Oh, thank goodness.
[143:59.44]Somebody in chat, this is so funny, somebody said, dude, what the fuck was the point of shitting on him?
[144:05.66]Dude, I had to defend my girl's honor.
[144:12.94]He punched my girlfriend in the face, so...
[144:16.41]I had to poop on him.
[144:20.91]What do you want me to say?
[144:24.58]But you just got her killed right there.
[144:27.28]Let me tell you, if I had one in the chamber, I would've pooped on him too.
[144:32.84]Alright.
[144:33.80]Here's the generational way to make it impossible to lose.
[144:36.50]Are you ready to hear this?
[144:40.68]I'm going to camp in the bathroom.
[144:43.53]Then sleep on the floor and stuff.
[145:02.62]No, they're not.
[145:05.16]Watch this.
[145:14.33]Let's get some food.
[145:29.00]Okay, here we go.
[145:32.57]Perfect place to do this.
[145:33.85]Just hang out here and look at how impossible it's going to be to lose.
[145:55.88]It's like I have a...
[146:03.39]It's the gun in the frame.
[146:09.82]What do you want?
[146:11.04]Please go away.
[146:12.35]Please go away.
[146:19.25]Go away!
[146:20.23]Okay.
[146:36.53]There's a stall right next to ours.
[146:46.42]Your feet don't even touch the ground.
[146:48.37]That's...
[146:53.74]Alright Barry Rock, I would love to hang out with you.
[146:57.72]That means you have to stand in the way.
[147:06.72]I'm going to sit in the toilet the whole day, and I'm going to go to sleep, get up and do the same exact thing the next day.
[147:12.98]And gosh darn it, there's no way I can lose.
[147:23.95]If I have to poop, it's going right there.
[147:25.31]And then I can just go to bed.
[147:55.08]I'll take a shower.
[148:05.83]You need some money?
[148:15.96]um why why is there a cue to the why are they obsessed with okay why are they doing this
[148:31.96]It's so amazing that I said that guy can hang out with me because now he's literally just body blocking.
[148:36.96]It's perfect.
[148:39.91]Good luck.
[148:45.56]Yeah, eat shit.
[148:46.97]See ya.
[148:59.75]And if I have to go, I can just use this.
[149:06.72]What?
[149:25.57]El Nino Bueno Malo, aren't you tired of pouring your energy into working out for such small gains?
[149:32.94]10 bucks, I could hook you up with some steroids that will give you a big result.
[149:35.88]Is this convictable?
[149:47.84]He just gave me steroids.
[149:49.35]I guess I'm not arrested.
[149:54.58]Hell yeah.
[149:59.22]Suplexing the doctor?
[150:06.95]I want no part of this.
[150:15.04]That's a cool skateboard though.
[150:24.49]Okay, let me...
[150:27.73]I'd appreciate if you could do me a favor.
[150:29.00]What do you want?
[150:36.07]Could you make sure that Alex gets a beer bottle by seven tomorrow?
[150:40.98]Okay.
[150:45.32]Give him a beer.
[150:46.10]I need a... What does a beer even look like?
[150:48.56]I can't tell the difference between water and beer.
[150:51.77]Alright, let's wipe my ass.
[150:55.41]Good.
[150:56.13]I think that's what I was doing.
[150:59.19]Is that a beer?
[151:02.91]Is this a beer?
[151:06.26]Is that a beer?
[151:15.24]An actual police escort?
[151:18.55]Sure.
[151:25.78]The beer bottle is dark green So this is not beer
[151:34.07]Wait, wouldn't it be though?
[151:34.83]Because the water is blue.
[151:39.84]Because the one underneath me is water, right?
[151:47.55]The one I have is soda.
[151:50.57]Okay.
[152:03.65]Oh, I don't know if I can find it.
[152:07.35]It kind of just needs to spawn.
[152:09.10]Get away from me.
[152:09.64]Get away from me!
[152:17.52]Play some basketball, workout.
[152:21.83]Ride the bike a little bit.
[152:28.64]How would I even know that about anybody?
[152:34.79]A new officer.
[152:35.61]Officer Graves.
[152:44.68]30 minute stream.
[152:46.00]Well, I can assure you that whatever happens at the end of this is, this is it.
[152:50.29]This was a one good boy run.
[152:52.61]And it's been a long one.
[152:55.33]But this is it.
[153:16.64]That cost a dollar to do that?
[153:18.91]Give me this thing.
[153:19.85]Let's go.
[153:22.61]I'm almost at 80% strength.
[153:40.41]I mean, 205 pounds at 4'6"?
[153:43.37]I actually am like a little... ...compact.
[153:52.36]I'm like a fucking...
[153:56.85]Bowling ball?
[154:02.06]Little mini tank.
[154:05.46]Alright, don't go overboard with this.
[154:07.67]In fact, bring that back to the cell.
[154:11.43]It's getting late.
[154:12.04]What am I in?
[154:12.85]Cell 3?
[154:22.97]Bye.
[154:32.10]Don't trip and break your whole body right now, you idiot.
[154:37.17]I know, you just... Don't emulate me.
[154:44.94]What are you doing in here?
[154:53.87]Camera?
[154:55.90]Okay.
[154:58.08]It's almost time for bed.
[155:04.32]Get away.
[155:05.46]One bullet that bounces off the wall and hits me in the face.
[155:08.77]It's over.
[155:14.02]I need to get out of the cell because it's gonna be insubordination if I don't.
[155:19.50]So I need to wait till 22.
[155:23.24]Great.
[155:41.63]My health is almost at zero.
[155:44.99]Can I die just by standing here?
[155:51.46]Anybody have a food?
[155:52.17]Anybody sandwich?
[155:54.85]Anybody have a sandwich?
[156:08.54]I need to sleep.
[156:09.45]I'll get arrested.
[156:10.53]Hold on.
[156:10.81]I can go to the cafeteria.
[156:15.55]Get to the cafeteria.
[156:16.94]Eat something.
[156:26.11]Where's the vending machine?
[156:30.91]Move out of the way!
[156:43.12]No, drink!
[156:44.02]What the fuck are you talking about?
[156:49.84]I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive, I'm alive.
[156:54.10]Holy shit.
[156:55.27]Saul Ferrari just saved the whole run.
[156:59.82]Oh my god, dude.
[157:01.59]Thank you so much.
[157:05.48]I don't want the beer!
[157:09.41]I'm dying.
[157:10.35]Put this down.
[157:11.00]I need health now.
[157:12.00]Doctor, doctor, doctor.
[157:13.85]Where's the fucking doctor?
[157:15.73]Somebody suplexed his ass and killed him.
[157:17.92]This pizza.
[157:38.55]Everything is fine.
[157:40.24]I took a sip of beer and it almost killed me.
[157:49.98]I was trying to take a bite out of the apple.
[157:55.36]Okay, where is the beer that I had?
[157:57.09]I can still deliver that, right?
[158:01.20]Where does it want me to go?
[158:05.31]I think I failed it.
[158:07.44]Ah shit, I failed it.
[158:10.99]Alright, we're almost there.
[158:20.20]Sorry I failed, I know, I fucked up.
[158:27.52]22 to 6.
[158:31.22]Did the believers win?
[158:32.12]The believers almost just lost right there.
[158:37.92]That was a huge W for that guy that said, I found you on the ground.
[158:46.91]Please tell me I picked up a steak and not the gun.
[158:51.33]Oh, thank god.
[158:52.23]Okay.
[158:55.23]That guy's trying to hurt us every time.
[159:01.74]Alright, let's work out.
[159:08.60]There's nothing to work out with?
[159:17.16]What about the workshop?
[159:24.06]I could camp the toilet.
[159:25.18]I could.
[159:25.54]You're right, I could camp the toilet.
[159:28.18]Or I could paint.
[159:37.56]Keep picking up weights and leaving them across the prison.
[159:39.51]Well, I didn't mean to do that.
[159:40.86]I was...
[159:41.26]I had to...
[159:42.44]I was...
[159:42.97]I literally just died.
[159:58.08]Just trying to respawn stuff.
[160:02.49]How did I end up in this?
[160:05.97]Lucy, Lakes is wanted for assault.
[160:12.13]Well, good getting out of this room.
[160:24.64]I didn't do anything I'm just a bystander I didn't do anything let's see how this plays out
[160:42.58]They're all clapping.
[160:45.67]Ow!
[160:49.38]Alright doctor, get the fuck out of here.
[161:11.58]Uh... You're in the way of the bathroom.
[161:16.40]Would you like this riot shield, El Niño Bueno Malo?
[161:20.49]I actually would because I'm going to go camp in the bathroom.
[161:22.94]Sure.
[161:31.34]Okay, what happens if you kill the doctor?
[161:38.43]He just... Alright, Tommy, that's mine.
[161:43.21]Can I have that back, please?
[161:44.25]That's my shield.
[161:48.29]If I take this from him, is he gonna freak out?
[161:50.20]That's mine.
[161:52.31]That actually is mine.
[161:58.50]Oh, what the fuck, dude?
[162:00.25]Fine, take the skateboard back.
[162:01.53]I'm trying to get the...
[162:02.32]I didn't know you had this in your hands.
[162:04.57]Oh, man.
[162:06.09]Here, take it.
[162:07.26]We're cool.
[162:08.00]You're my gang.
[162:19.52]Give that to me.
[162:21.96]I don't even want to touch this guy.
[162:25.99]If I touch this guy, he dies.
[162:27.96]And I'm not being responsible for it.
[162:29.74]Let him die on his own.
[162:34.56]Right, like he'll die on his own and I'll take the shield off the ground.
[162:52.90]I'm fine, man.
[162:54.34]Are you alright?
[163:05.76]Please, give this back to- I don't- I can't touch him!
[163:10.68]Can somebody just bump into this guy?
[163:13.09]No, you idiot.
[163:14.75]No, I don't want to buy the shield.
[163:17.27]I was handed to me by a friend.
[163:18.95]No, it's not worth $15.
[163:40.99]He's gonna sell me steroids again.
[163:42.74]I'll take them.
[163:46.92]For only eight bucks?
[163:47.94]That's a steal.
[163:57.45]Nice, 82% strength.
[164:02.45]Alright, give it back.
[164:08.79]You had your fun with it.
[164:10.18]I need that, though.
[164:12.32]Can I have that riot shield, please?
[164:18.74]Can somebody please just bump into this guy?
[164:20.81]Harry, punch him in the face.
[164:23.68]You have to punch him once.
[164:24.75]No, you are not getting away with that.
[164:27.68]Where did he go?
[164:31.59]Oh, come on.
[164:34.35]Is he actually gone?
[164:43.57]He's gone.
[164:49.04]The hospital's a mess.
[164:49.79]Help me fix all the furniture before it gets any worse.
[164:52.84]Okay.
[165:04.00]Look at how strong I am now.
[165:13.13]Remember I couldn't even lift one of these?
[165:17.26]Alright, it's time for bed.

[169:20.38]Mm-hmm.
[169:26.00]Hmm.
[169:45.29]I didn't start a fight.
[169:54.66]Oh, I only have two more days.
[169:58.35]Oh, no.
[170:01.27]Please turn and make it stop.
[170:02.81]Make the ride stop.
[170:04.58]Oh.
[170:05.29]Oh.
[170:11.11]You can't sue me.
[170:21.10]I just peed!
[170:28.46]I just peed!
[170:30.93]I was so careful!
[170:38.77]Oh, my head hurts!
[170:40.44]That's fucking unbelievable, dude!
[170:42.81]There's no way!
[170:45.44]Why?
[170:47.27]What am I?
[170:48.18]I have to just hope that they rule my favor.
[170:51.02]What happened?
[170:53.18]I didn't even joke.
[170:54.46]I was just killing time until it was time.
[170:57.21]The guy jumped at me.
[170:59.56]I fell off and pissed.
[171:00.82]Was that like a flight?
[171:01.85]Like a fear response?
[171:03.17]I peed 10 seconds ago.
[171:13.50]I have to just hope.
[171:15.64]Just arrest me, please.
[171:18.49]I know he knocked the piss out of me, but dude, you watched me run to pee.
[171:24.91]I peed not even five seconds before that happened.
[171:27.66]It was like maybe 30 seconds.
[171:35.50]Just arrest me, please, because that's unbelievable.
[171:39.58]That guy fought me.
[171:41.18]He fucking punched me.
[171:43.41]Alright, arrest me!
[171:50.93]That's...
[171:51.69]I... What a fucking...
[171:54.17]I can't...
[171:54.53]I have got nothing to say.
[171:55.37]I have literally got nothing to say.
[172:00.61]Oh, this is the new judge.
[172:02.16]Alright.
[172:02.55]New judge is going to have to make a reputation here.
[172:04.94]No conviction.
[172:05.65]Come on.
[172:08.04]That was such dog shit if it actually is a conviction.
[172:16.07]No, what happened was I was riding my skateboard and somebody knocked me on my back and knocked the pee out of my body!
[172:27.07]That's so funny.
[172:29.46]Oh, please, please don't do it like this.
[172:37.75]Ayy, alright.
[172:40.10]Alright.
[172:43.63]Hey, that's a W. W, judge.
[172:59.71]That's so unbelievable, though.
[173:01.36]Like, give me a break.
[173:02.62]See?
[173:04.51]A guy does something like that, and then you end up...
[173:07.39]Still can't get over it.
[173:09.81]I'm peeing for a full hour.
[173:19.84]Leave me alone.
[173:20.88]What the fuck?!
[173:26.31]I just wanted to pee!
[173:28.80]You... what?
[173:37.10]You can't pee?
[173:42.74]I have to get out.
[173:43.89]I have to try to get out, right?
[173:50.60]I'm- I didn't do anything!
[173:58.18]I have to just try to climb the fucking fence.
[174:00.06]I have to try to climb-
[174:12.22]I can't, guys, what do you want me to say?
[174:15.06]I went to my cell to pee.
[174:17.55]And I apparently got caught being in my cell when I'm not supposed to.
[174:20.78]I have to go to like the public toilet.
[174:33.31]I might be...
[174:34.52]I might be cooked here.
[174:35.71]Yep.
[174:36.36]I...
[174:43.95]And this is the guy that put me in prison in the first place.
[174:50.36]Oh no.
[174:58.42]Oh, it was... What a disaster.
[175:03.00]What a disaster.
[175:06.39]What a disaster.
[175:16.21]What a disaster.
[175:17.43]I...
[175:30.44]He...
[175:31.33]He let me go.
[175:35.33]Alright, Believers, you got one more chance here.
[175:40.59]We're keeping it Day 15.
[175:47.28]Dude, that went so wrong.
[175:49.98]So quickly.
[175:50.95]How?
[175:55.55]Wait, who is this person?
[176:08.69]I actually just wanted to pee.
[176:10.18]The game punished me for peeing.
[176:12.09]It punished me for having urine in my body.
[176:17.87]Who the fuck are you?
[176:18.94]I've never seen you before in my entire life!
[176:24.70]I don't know who this person is.
[176:30.78]Help me!
[176:38.71]Wait, I actually do need to help this guy.
[176:41.77]This guy saved my ass.
[177:13.29]Is there a bet?
[177:14.46]Is there a bet going on right now of me staying alive till 15?
[177:21.76]Okay guys, hear me out.
[177:24.33]Look at how little time there is to get to day 15.
[177:28.56]Do you understand how actually not possible?
[177:33.07]It would be to lose.
[177:37.88]The Believers have no points left.
[177:40.69]We're gonna gain them back right now for you.
[177:42.18]Alright.
[177:43.26]Do it.
[177:43.80]Do it.
[177:44.22]Day 15.
[177:44.87]It's literally 24 hours.
[177:45.91]I can do it.
[177:55.92]This is a guaranteed victory.
[178:09.85]Fucking make it to the hospital, man.
[178:14.44]Everyone's... Everyone's...
[178:17.89]Everybody's hovering over the vet button.
[178:19.60]It's such a sure thing, isn't it?
[178:21.23]But is it though?
[178:21.97]Maybe not.
[178:37.63]Oh my god, my face hurts from laughing at all this.
[178:42.20]Can you please get out of the cutscene?
[178:50.27]Yes, I did pee my pants.
[178:57.56]Can we get over this, please?
[179:00.83]I need to sleep in the bed before I die.
[179:13.90]Just want to let you know that I lost $1,000 in Atlantic City, but I've never been more annoyed at losing something than right now.
[179:45.05]Somebody's dead.
[179:46.14]That's nine, not a three.
[179:53.99]Get that gun out of here dude.
[180:04.28]Look at this.
[180:06.19]Imagine doubting.
[180:07.58]Imagine being that greedy.
[180:09.65]Look at the greed on these people.
[180:11.60]We're literally there.
[180:26.19]Oh my god.
[180:27.32]We're still using DVDs.
[180:38.49]God, my head hurts from laughing at that, dude.
[180:40.54]It was the way that I fell down and pissed my pants.
[180:43.62]I have a headache now.
[180:44.48]Happy New Year.
[180:47.35]Happy New Year, everybody.
[180:49.46]Oh my goodness, my fucking head hurts.
[180:52.47]That was too funny, though.
[180:55.96]Why did I slide that far?
[180:59.27]Get out!
[181:02.20]Okay, I'm standing fucking still.
[181:12.09]I know I'm just been like yelling into the microphone for like an hour.
[181:21.47]Is this guy alright?
[181:24.67]Oh, I don't think that guy is gonna make it.
[181:40.47]I drank the dudes last beer.
[181:42.92]That's sad.
[181:56.35]Okay We're almost there
[182:03.02]I have a vantage point of the entire prison.
[182:08.99]We just sit.
[182:10.96]We don't do anything.
[182:11.61]And when we see any danger, we leave immediately.
[182:33.81]Except, officer, this guy's attacking me now.
[182:37.63]Officer, the guy's attacking me.
[182:39.85]officer there's a person there's two officers get him off of me get him off
[182:52.73]Oh no, Mac Bison is dead.
[183:08.37]Give me a health pack.
[183:13.98]I'm literally just stuffing myself.
[183:18.97]Okay, I thought I died.
[183:19.73]I thought I died.
[183:22.67]Okay, I thought I died.
[183:23.65]I was like, you gotta be fucking kidding me, why did I die?
[183:36.30]Can I shit in the urinal?
[183:39.90]I need to go to the bathroom.
[183:41.52]Please get out of...
[183:44.11]Okay
[183:51.71]I'm so traumatized I have to fucking get out of here.
[183:56.10]Nobody... No police officers saw it.
[183:58.21]Nobody saw it, right?
[184:00.58]No, it's this guy again.
[184:01.89]I just have to make it to 15.
[184:08.58]Please.
[184:11.05]Where am I?
[184:12.51]Shit in that fucking toilet now!
[184:17.13]You motherfucker!
[184:19.12]You go use this one!
[184:23.08]Thank goodness.
[184:32.97]Oh no.
[184:33.87]I'm strong enough to pick this fucking toilet up.
[184:41.58]Get away from me.
[184:53.84]Good for you.
[185:04.96]Why is everybody staring at me?
[185:06.43]Okay.
[185:08.86]Okay.
[185:09.76]It's a defense mechanism.
[185:12.15]And I have made myself completely safe.
[185:14.83]I have a shield.
[185:16.32]I have a toilet shield, and I'm making it all the way to 15.
[185:20.27]All these guys want me dead.
[185:21.38]They're all programmed to kill me now.
[185:24.27]Why am I crying?
[185:26.61]What's wrong with me?
[185:30.13]No, I have no control of the character.
[185:31.81]What are you doing?
[185:33.03]I don't have control of my character.
[185:35.66]What is he fucking thinking?
[185:37.73]Please?
[185:38.48]No, why would you leave that safe zone?
[185:43.44]God, he's crashing out.
[185:45.40]He's crashing out.
[185:46.43]Please don't kill anybody.
[185:47.47]Don't kill anybody.
[185:50.20]What's your problem, man?
[185:51.34]No, no, no, no.
[185:52.01]I didn't...
[185:53.04]No, no, let him go, let him go.
[185:54.19]Let him go, let him go.
[186:11.20]That guy's gonna get arrested for shitting.
[186:18.23]How much health do I have?
[186:35.38]Oh my goodness gracious, what a joke.
[186:45.79]I'm not, you can fight whoever you want.
[186:47.59]It's not gonna be me you're fighting.
[186:53.27]I think I'm safe enough now where I'm gonna make it to 15.
[186:59.01]Just play a game of basketball.
[187:02.12]And then I can sleep.
[187:18.11]There's mayhem outside.
[187:28.13]Alright, do you want the ball?
[187:31.89]I'm leaving then.
[187:32.50]I'm not dealing with this right now.
[187:41.34]phone?
[187:50.96]Drunk food might give you a quick energy boost, but it's bad for your health.
[187:53.91]Would you fucking call somebody else?
[188:03.75]Mmmmmmmm
[188:17.14]Okay.
[188:24.66]Are all the toilets broken or can I make sure I go to the bathroom?
[188:47.21]Alright, we'll get out of the way.
[188:48.21]You're fine.
[188:51.58]I'm going to make it.
[188:55.29]Somebody's dead.
[188:59.45]Sam Shady's dead.
[189:00.37]I had nothing to do with it.
[189:01.80]That's fine.
[189:02.22]I didn't touch anybody.
[189:08.84]How many times have I said I had nothing to do with it this last two or three hours?
[189:16.33]Heard you crapped yourself.
[189:17.24]Yep.
[189:17.71]It was really embarrassing and horrible.
[189:21.40]I'm gonna go to my cell.
[189:24.67]Just prepare.
[189:25.20]I got plenty of health.
[189:27.29]I just sat on the toilet.
[189:33.75]Do I have to pee?
[189:34.70]Wait, I'm gonna pee too as well.
[189:49.05]I'm not eating any more food.
[189:50.43]I'm not drinking any more beverages.
[189:52.91]Period.
[190:09.02]Just stay alive and I can finally give the Believers at least something.
[190:16.21]Right in front of the cell.
[190:18.89]How come he's not getting in trouble for being in there?
[190:25.60]I go pee for one second.
[190:27.42]I get arrested in a minute.
[190:45.04]Get out of here.
[190:53.67]Stay away from the concentration of people.
[191:03.02]Just blend in and no one will care.
[191:19.93]Fastest route into that cell is right here.
[191:39.08]Second I hit 15, I'm going to bed.
[191:41.81]Picking up that dumbbell and I'm smashing Hodge's head in.
[191:45.85]He's right there.
[191:52.33]Remember, I just gotta make it to day 15.
[192:15.04]I don't want to throw this.
[192:15.90]I want it to run, but that's okay.
[192:17.33]I can just throw it over there.
[192:21.24]It's almost time to get back in the cell, and I'm ready for the next day.
[192:25.72]Alright, there you go.
[192:27.39]Sorry doubters, uh, and sorry believers for making you bel- Get the fuck away from me with that.
[192:36.62]actually get this too many this concentration people is too much over there
[192:45.89]He's going to fire it.
[192:56.42]I'm staying behind that guy until it rings to go.
[193:07.42]He's aiming it.
[193:08.48]He's aiming it.
[193:09.14]It's getting a little feisty in here.
[193:10.45]I'm going to bed.
[193:18.83]Alright, it's almost impossible to lose now.
[193:22.06]Congratulations, Believers.
[193:23.39]I actually gave you a win.
[193:32.14]And now, it's time to complete this arc.
[193:44.48]Remember me?
[193:45.00]Or, more importantly, do you remember my brother?
[193:49.77]And my other brother?
[193:55.77]Well, it's gonna be hard to remember when the back of your skull gets fuckin' crushed.
[194:04.95]You know, that's very, that's a good tip.
[194:16.91]He's burning!
[194:27.14]Oh, I'm burning.
[194:35.34]Oh shit, just get him!
[194:38.33]He's back with the fuckin' bazooka!
[194:47.64]I have to put him through the table.
[194:54.66]I gotta do a move through the table.
[195:01.97]I lost an arm.
[195:12.58]It's like, what happened?
[195:19.15]I can't believe I suplexed him through the table.
[195:22.10]Oh my god.
[195:23.04]What the fuck, man?
[195:24.68]I'm so glad I suplexed him through the table.
[195:38.96]What happened to the film?
[195:40.33]That's so brutal.
[195:42.34]It's gone.
[195:43.14]Ed is not coming back.
[195:46.15]Watch me not get convicted for this, but I peed my pants two days ago.
[195:51.44]This game is...
[195:53.66]I'm sorry, Believers.
[195:55.43]Believers, it's unfair.
[195:56.40]Life's unfair.
[195:58.01]I literally killed a guy in plain sight.
[196:00.41]I caused a riot and I killed a guy.
[196:10.68]Actually, I'm bleeding to death.
[196:13.53]Thanks for getting rid of Kenny Hodge.
[196:15.46]It's about time somebody took out the trash.
[196:17.47]Can somebody fucking help me?
[196:21.15]Shake your hand, son!
[196:28.43]Wait a minute.
[196:29.28]But wait, I...
[196:30.65]But wait, I need to just go back to my cell.
[196:36.18]I thought you were dead, El Niño Bueno Malo.
[196:38.92]You won't be so lucky next time.
[196:56.92]No, that's my friend!
[196:58.94]That's the wrong guy!
[197:09.29]Oh, take this entire place down with me!
[197:22.20]Come on!
[197:22.94]You want some?
[197:24.92]You want some?
[197:30.98]Oh no, I'm playing down.
[197:35.82]Come on, come on, bring it in then.
[197:44.12]Oh, I may have bled to death.
[197:49.08]Quick, eat this.
[197:50.11]Eat the protein.
[197:52.94]Come on.
[197:55.63]Grrr!
[198:05.20]You want to buy this off me for 40 bucks?
[198:17.02]That's quite a deal.
[198:26.18]Get away from me!
[198:31.52]Did you just say I'm sorry?
[198:32.39]I didn't mean for anyone to get hurt.
[198:41.51]I'm so dead here.
[198:48.17]This is crazy.
[198:50.28]This is crazy.
[198:55.89]I won't die.
[198:56.96]I'm still alive.
[198:58.39]My wound has healed over.
[199:06.97]That guy's reading me, I think, my last rights.
[199:19.48]Can I make it out?
[199:24.10]I'm gonna climb over the fence.
[199:32.07]Thank you.
[199:38.87]Can you help me up, please?
[199:41.59]Help me up.
[199:47.73]Go to the hospital.
[199:48.64]Uh, mom, you see how hard it is to walk?
[200:04.84]I'm still alive.
[200:09.40]I'm still alive.
[200:11.72]Oh no, I've got an extra shroom.
[200:13.79]Where am I going?
[200:15.56]Where am I going?
[200:25.61]Apparently, I thought, they all think I was, do they think I'm a ghost?
[200:35.01]Yeah.
[200:46.60]How am I still alive?
[201:01.27]They can't kill me.
[201:03.74]They actually can't kill me.
[201:09.29]We're getting out, boys.
[201:15.63]We're outta here.
[201:16.86]Anybody that gets in my way is gonna see.
[201:18.68]There, Baker.
[201:25.55]El niño bueno, malo.
[201:28.97]Oh, oh.
[201:31.96]Oh.
[201:36.62]I think I started biting that guy.
[201:48.69]Get the fuck away from me!
[201:59.27]Come on, I gotta get to the other side!
[202:10.44]Stay back!
[202:17.61]I can do this with one arm.
[202:18.92]Let's go.
[202:23.62]Woo!
[202:27.02]Woo!
[202:27.12]Woo!
[202:27.22]Woo!
[202:27.32]Woo!
[202:27.42]Woo!
[202:36.51]Wait.
[202:45.89]I'm no longer in trouble.
[202:52.88]You know, let's make peace.
[202:57.57]I can't see us ever being friends, but at least we can move on with our lives.

[203:14.38]Arrest him!
[203:24.99]And we're gonna get out just like that.
[203:27.30]Come on, you could do it a little bit... Ooh, that looked like it hurt a lot.
[203:33.82]That looked like it hurt a lot.
[203:51.81]Arrest this guy, he's a bad guy.
[204:18.54]Climb over it!
[204:20.04]Oh, I'm dead.
[204:25.23]I'm alive.
[204:38.67]I'm getting full health.
[204:40.26]I'm getting a key and I'm walking out the front door.
[204:52.24]Do you need a key to get out the front door or can I get out through the visitor center?
[204:58.92]All charges dropped by the way, yeah?
[205:08.98]That's our plan tomorrow.
[205:16.80]Dude.
[205:19.32]Apparently you saved me.
[205:20.87]Alright.
[205:25.87]Oh, right, I forgot the aftermath of everything that just happened.
[205:38.69]Well, I'm going to bed.
[205:53.36]Stop dude, come on.
[206:01.26]Hey, you know what?
[206:01.86]After a day like yesterday, ain't nothing gonna wake me up.
[206:06.56]That is the deepest sleep I've ever had in my life.
[206:20.86]Alright, it's time to get up.
[206:22.44]Alright, I need a key and I need to escape.
[206:29.52]This is just to find a key.
[206:34.25]Fire!
[206:34.71]Everybody get out of here!
[206:40.49]Wait, like leave the prison?
[206:44.54]Yoink.
[206:55.90]Okay.
[206:57.49]I can just go right out the station door.
[207:00.85]That's the plan.
[207:01.37]I'm getting right in a car and I'm getting the hell out of here.
[207:11.88]Motorcycle.
[207:13.16]GG
[207:20.67]okay oh get up good alright we need to go this way
[207:33.14]So what can I do here?
[207:36.98]Hotel, barbershop, hardware store, the grocery, the train.
[207:40.39]Should I go to the train?
[207:46.66]Honestly, I'm not even under arrest.
[207:53.83]Get new clothes.
[207:57.07]Does that work?
[208:04.51]it does wow okay so I need to go to the clothes store
[208:11.33]Which is just straight down on the right, I think.
[208:14.85]And change your hair, too.
[208:17.34]Because I'm not wanted.
[208:36.13]Fashion.
[208:36.66]Why is it not open?
[208:39.64]Are they closed?
[208:44.61]No, I don't want to go to the forest, man.
[208:45.93]We thought we lost you.
[208:49.81]I'm not doing this right now.
[208:56.59]Shit, come on, open.
[209:06.49]It's too early.
[209:09.12]What is even in here?
[209:11.79]It's probably eight.
[209:12.45]Yeah, probably eight or nine.
[209:15.56]What is the point of this?
[209:17.88]I can go to the suburbs?
[209:19.76]What do you mean I can go to the suburbs?
[209:21.95]There's a whole other game out here.
[209:26.46]Okay, let me buy something.
[209:30.07]Uh... What should I do?
[209:35.45]What do I do?
[209:42.18]Do I have to talk to somebody?
[209:45.39]Go in the changing room.
[210:00.44]Let's go.
[210:21.70]Civilian, here we go.
[210:24.70]Does that count?
[210:28.16]How do I, uh, say accept it?
[210:31.48]No, I... How much money did I just spend?
[211:00.72]Just change every single thing I have on.
[211:27.79]Okay, I'm a different guy now.
[211:32.72]My way to the cinema.
[211:33.49]You need a ride?
[211:37.98]Um, no.
[211:41.80]What the fuck?
[211:42.32]I freaked out by my own character.
[211:54.13]Nice civilian outfit.
[211:55.94]I just changed everything randomly.
[212:04.37]I'm three dollars in debt?
[212:07.42]How do I make money quick?
[212:24.88]Sports store?
[212:28.62]Go rob a bank.
[212:29.56]I want to go to the suburbs.
[212:33.33]I'm going to the suburbs.
[212:43.05]Give me that knife.
[212:47.59]Now I'm just a horror movie guy.
[212:51.76]I went to...
[212:53.10]Okay, well, whatever.
[212:53.86]We have the suburbs this way?
[213:04.84]No, that's the trailer park.
[213:06.12]I want to go to the suburbs.
[213:13.41]Oh, shut up, Teresa.
[213:16.30]She broke into the prison to come and fight me.
[213:18.70]It was weird.
[213:20.73]Okay, we're in the suburbs.
[213:24.65]Just be normal and act natural.
[213:35.16]I'm going to park right here and then I guess I'm going to go into three.
[213:42.96]This doesn't open.
[213:49.44]One.
[213:50.21]After I got out of prison, I found it hard to make any friends.
[213:57.79]That's sad.
[213:59.18]Sorry to hear that.
[214:02.65]Is one of these open?
[214:14.71]Maybe six?
[214:16.99]I need a key to get in.
[214:19.93]Uh, going through the window.
[214:22.66]Wait, can you?
[214:24.63]I don't want to commit any crimes.
[214:25.62]I just got out.
[214:43.98]Easy.
[214:49.54]I think I peed out the window.
[214:53.80]Basketball court?
[215:08.97]Cool.
[215:11.02]Wait a minute, that's you!
[215:11.88]It's that person that had it out for me.
[215:32.47]Why are you so good at dodging?
[215:40.42]How do I...
[215:41.30]Okay.
[215:41.69]Stone Cold, watch out, dog!
[215:45.19]Watch out!
[215:45.73]Stop!
[215:47.22]Okay, the car changes direction of what up is down and down is up.
[215:52.36]I have to press down on the analog to drive this forward.
[215:55.72]Now I have to press up.
[216:00.35]Oh, goddammit, I didn't want to do that.
[216:03.66]Wait, you still- That's my shield!
[216:45.86]I actually did just get spawn camped.
[216:49.98]Damn it.
[216:51.41]Well, that was a good run though.
[216:57.46]That was a wild last 30 or 40 minutes.
[217:10.47]It's not over till you're dead.
[217:12.00]Dressed like this saying that?
[217:23.06]Watch me get acquitted and I can just leave.
[217:27.40]No.
[217:34.36]Why did it last so long?
[217:36.31]There were other officers that didn't know who I was.
[217:39.11]That was weird.
[217:41.60]I thought I kind of got away with it.
[217:45.89]You might still have the prison undershirt on.
[217:48.80]Is that what it is?
[217:56.62]Imagine putting handcuffs on one arm.
[217:58.90]That doesn't really work.
[218:05.06]I don't have control of the character.
[218:06.49]Why does she have a bone?
[218:07.58]Is that a human bone?
[218:12.60]Ah.
[218:23.37]That was unbelievable.
[218:36.19]Alright, I'm done.
[218:37.67]I'm done.
[218:38.17]I'll see you guys later.
[218:39.00]Happy New Year.
[219:05.56]No, it's my crossbow.
[219:31.15]How do I do that?
[219:31.66]What is it?
[219:31.94]Taunt and...
[219:35.39]Wait, hold on.
[219:35.93]That's the guy.
[219:37.78]My ultimate nemesis.
[219:38.56]The guy that put me in here.
[219:40.49]Hold on.
[219:41.13]Hold on.
[219:50.02]Did I throw a baked potato at me?
[220:14.86]Wait, I'll take care of it.
[220:17.52]How could you do this to me?
[220:18.59]Don't come crying to me when you need help.
[220:29.47]The one arm that I have?
[220:41.57]This game is wild.
[220:43.97]I'm glad I played it though, it was absolutely insane.
[220:50.59]I think we had a pretty good
[220:59.63]Yeah, happy new year.
[221:01.50]That's going to be the end.
[221:02.59]I only wanted to stream for like two to three hours at most.
[221:07.03]And it's been about like three and a half, so.
[221:10.99]Have a great rest of your New Year's Eve.
[221:12.99]If it's already New Year's for you, Happy New Year.
[221:17.86]Have a great evening.
[221:18.82]Have a great night.
[221:21.47]Be responsible.
[221:23.13]If you're going to go party or have fun, just be responsible about it.
[221:30.56]What's going on with my arm?
[221:31.77]Why do I have like a robot hand?
[221:46.12]Just hit me in the face with it, please.
[221:50.54]Kill that guy.
[221:53.02]We didn't even get a thing about Hodge.
[221:55.71]I think he just went away.
[222:00.18]Nothing popped up on screen about him, right?
[222:11.08]Alright.
[222:11.47]See you later.
[222:11.94]Happy New Year.
[222:20.71]Everything's gonna be alright.
[222:28.09]dun dun dun dun dun dun dun
[222:37.86]Oh, you know what?
[222:41.11]Let's raid somebody.
[222:42.88]Let's raid limes.
[222:45.32]Limes has raided this channel, like, five times in the last, like, few months.
[222:49.56]Go say hello to Limes.
[222:50.36]Go say happy new year to Limes.
[223:03.70]Go say Happy New Year.
[223:05.16]Oh, she's playing Hades 2.
[223:10.30]Can I finish this before 2026?
[223:11.77]We'll see.
[223:22.78]Take care.
[223:23.42]Bye-bye.
[223:24.05]Have a good one.
[223:24.85]Sayonara.
[223:26.99]Happy New Year.
