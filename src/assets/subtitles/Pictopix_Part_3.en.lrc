[00:06.30]Did I scare you?
[00:13.38]Alright, let's begin a wine down here.
[00:14.84]I'm gonna play a few Picross levels, we'll just chill.
[00:19.67]Gonna close out of Sekiro though.
[00:28.45]What's the total in-game time?
[00:29.85]Let's see, I'm curious.
[00:32.39]Because I saw articles, reviewers, other streamers talk about their game time.
[00:37.77]I'm just curious what the actual in-game time was.
[00:41.79]Let's see.
[00:45.55]How long did it take me to beat Sekiro?
[00:47.77]The last two hours or so was not finishing the game.
[00:55.43]Just wandering around, right?
[00:56.69]Let's see.
[00:59.22]I have 42 hours in Sekiro.
[01:04.17]So the last two hours or so were spent kind of walking around doing optional stuff.
[01:09.51]So 40 hours.
[01:12.39]Took just about 40 hours to beat the game.
[01:15.95]That sounds about right.
[01:19.28]And that's pretty much, most people have said between 35 to 55 hours.
[01:21.92]30 to 40 is average, yeah.
[01:29.37]Damn, it was fun.
[01:32.35]And that's the end of that.
[01:36.35]Just finished my second playthrough at 45 hours.
[01:40.21]That sounds about right.
[01:44.27]Any thoughts on Borderlands 3?
[01:47.47]No.
[01:48.43]I'm not really a Borderlands fan.
[01:49.89]I never was.
[01:50.36]Dude, there's a PictoPix update from like a week ago.
[02:00.79]Hello, everybody.
[02:01.45]I'm very excited to announce that a new free update is available for PictoPix.
[02:06.72]This update adds new content.
[02:09.34]Ooh.
[02:10.98]We got new content, boys and girls.
[02:14.42]He hates Borderlands.
[02:15.42]I just don't really like it.
[02:17.75]I don't hate it, but... I don't really... I never really was a fan.
[02:22.93]Not that I don't like the idea.
[02:29.53]Let's get it open here.
[02:38.78]It's not his cup of tea.
[02:39.76]Yeah, yeah.
[02:46.02]I watched your first PictoPix stream and now I have 21 hours in the game.
[02:49.48]It's great.
[02:51.09]I'm so happy if you never even knew what Picross was.
[02:55.01]If you're into it now.
[02:59.63]PictoPix, there it is.
[03:06.15]There we go.
[03:07.77]Play.
[03:12.29]Let's go classic.
[03:14.33]This is where we're at here.
[03:15.57]Is it linked to Twitch again?
[03:20.66]So you guys can guess?
[03:27.72]Should be.
[03:31.51]Maybe not.
[03:33.91]Let me make sure it's...
[03:38.43]Uh, enable to, ah, there we go.
[03:39.59]I have to turn it on.
[03:40.21]It should be on now.
[03:44.46]There we go.
[03:46.06]Now you guys can guess what it is.
[03:50.56]So this is 15 by 15.
[03:55.68]So we start off here.
[03:56.88]We got 10, 11.
[03:57.24]Can't really do much there.
[03:59.94]8, 9, 10.
[04:00.65]I could get the 8.
[04:03.09]If I just go like this and pretend.
[04:05.43]So that's 1.
[04:06.93]We got how many?
[04:07.75]1.
[04:07.93]That's 14, 13.
[04:09.45]So 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[04:09.95]I can probably go like this.
[04:12.57]So 8.
[04:12.73]Let's see.
[04:13.11]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[04:13.47]Maybe not.
[04:24.79]Because that would mean I'd have to go like kind of halfway through here.
[04:34.31]Let's see, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[04:40.15]I guess maybe like a couple of these could be between here.
[04:43.67]9, 2, 4, 6.
[04:56.43]Why is it telling dad jokes?
[05:03.68]Why are there cat facts going on with Nightbot?
[05:07.14]What?
[05:12.23]Let's see.
[05:12.53]3, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, not 15.
[05:13.25]Not a whole lot to start with here.
[05:28.04]I mean, I guess I go one, two, three, one, two, three.
[05:31.46]We know that as long as this is correct, which it kind of has to be.
[05:38.97]Now, does that help anything else?
[05:42.93]Not really.
[05:44.69]I mean, I guess here harder than Ishin.
[05:50.78]Oh yeah.
[05:50.94]I could see three.
[05:51.52]This has to be one, two, three.
[05:52.92]It has to be here somewhere.
[05:55.62]So there's no way it can be any of these.
[06:02.46]This might be the two.
[06:03.46]I can't really tell.
[06:06.70]The hardest decisions require the strongest wills.
[06:10.64]I'm surprised I don't have anything here.
[06:15.64]Like at the bottom or down here.
[06:23.43]Let me see.
[06:23.83]So that's...
[06:26.73]1413.
[06:26.81]Let me see here.
[06:30.23]Two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[06:33.19]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[06:36.75]So actually I don't know that info.
[06:40.50]I do not know that info.
[06:45.90]This makes it kind of worse though.
[06:54.06]Hmm.
[07:04.04]Where am I getting the two x's on the bottom?
[07:05.72]Well, with the larger, you've got to look for large numbers.
[07:10.02]Because you can fill them in because it has to be somewhere in the middle.
[07:12.87]But the reason why I'm doing the bottom x's here is because there has to be a 1 in a space.
[07:16.91]So there has to be at least two spaces before 8 is here.
[07:21.65]You know what I mean?
[07:23.19]So it can help sometimes.
[07:27.20]This one's kind of tricky because there's really not much to go on right now.
[07:33.80]Because this is 14.
[07:37.63]So... It's not 15 down.
[07:40.75]7, 8... 6, 7, 8, 9... I'm kind of stuck here.
[08:00.40]There's no way to tell if this is the 1 or the 2.
[08:08.98]Put it down here.
[08:10.94]Let's see.
[08:11.58]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[08:13.00]Let's just say 1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[08:16.92]Now, this is too much.
[08:19.63]Too much of a space.
[08:25.85]See, this one, on the other hand, you could mean, let's just look at it.
[08:30.93]Two spaces.
[08:33.77]It could be anywhere.
[08:34.81]It could be like this, right?
[08:40.80]It's too hard to tell.
[08:51.45]Because, hold on, three, two, two, this is part of the eight.
[08:57.54]Let's see, one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[09:04.67]This is not enough to go on.
[09:06.57]Because this could be here, right?
[09:10.17]1, 2, 3, 2, 2, 3.
[09:10.37]Or this could be 3.
[09:10.95]Or this could be 2.
[09:13.13]I need more info.
[09:13.95]Fuck.
[09:44.78]One, two, three, four, five.
[09:50.94]It's too many spaces.
[09:54.55]You got five full spaces of space here that, like, let's just say the overlap would have to be
[10:06.77]That's too many.
[10:13.00]Four, four, three.
[10:18.58]You really would have to just go like this.
[10:20.02]Yeah, I'm going to have to go like this.
[10:23.40]This is probably close enough, so it's probably going to be something like this.
[10:29.27]At least these two.
[10:30.65]At least these two at least probably have to be filled in.
[10:36.72]Cause if you do one, two, three, four, four, three, uh, I don't know because it could be like this then, right?
[10:49.82]The outlier here is this one's always filled in.
[10:54.64]So this one has to be filled in there for one, two, three.
[10:57.04]This is one, two, three.
[10:59.86]Alright.
[11:01.12]A little bit more info.
[11:10.29]Mmm, which leaves... Let's go like that.
[11:13.05]Let's just clear these.
[11:13.87]Alright, where the fuck are we now?
[11:32.40]One, two, three.
[11:33.32]One, two, three.
[11:37.24]If it was four, I could fill in both of these.
[11:40.83]It's not, though.
[11:46.23]Ugh.
[11:47.37]My brain is kind of on... I'm pretty slow right now, I'm not gonna lie.
[11:53.88]I'm in, like, the post-Sakiro fucking... I am, like, about to fall asleep.
[12:00.94]Uh... Well, there's no music playing right here.
[12:06.18]Let's put the jazz music on.
[12:11.48]There we go.
[12:15.24]This is definitely part of the three.
[12:23.99]At this point.
[12:29.24]Go to sleep?
[12:29.74]I'm alright for now.
[12:31.12]I might just call it here in like 20 minutes.
[12:46.02]I gotta have something better than that.
[12:52.51]Fuck this one.
[12:53.09]11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[13:08.83]11, 12, 13, 14, 15.
[13:10.59]Oh, fuck that one.
[13:16.17]Okay, that's it for this.
[13:19.32]He died to Picross.
[13:21.84]We got 9, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9!
[13:22.56]Look at that.
[13:23.04]Perfect.
[13:23.30]13, done.
[13:23.62]So this is 1, 2, 3.
[13:24.40]Uh-huh.
[13:37.63]One, two, three.
[13:41.16]Good.
[13:44.14]This, let's see.
[13:45.56]Let's say it was two here.
[13:48.88]Let's just take a look.
[13:49.68]So we got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[13:53.70]Let's just say it's either here or here.
[13:56.86]No way for me to get that.
[13:58.08]Let's just do it from here.
[13:59.82]So this is one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[14:03.58]Seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven.
[14:05.08]Four on each side.
[14:08.02]That works.
[14:10.42]Die to grid wheel.
[14:13.80]So this is 3, 1, 2.
[14:15.46]That means this is done.
[14:17.56]Nothing else underneath it.
[14:19.04]There's the 1.
[14:20.70]And 1, 2, 3 has to be up here somewhere like that.
[14:28.16]Speaking of 11s.
[14:28.54]12, 13, 14, 15.
[14:36.65]12, 13, 14.
[14:36.75]Alright.
[14:39.36]Oh, we got up here.
[14:40.82]2, 1, 2.
[14:41.54]That's a lot there.
[14:47.94]Let's see.
[14:48.30]What about down here?
[14:51.52]2, 1.
[14:53.14]So there's the 2, 1, 2.
[14:55.70]This might be the same thing.
[14:59.58]Yeah, that's the 2.
[15:03.31]So then look down here.
[15:04.54]2, 3, 4.
[15:07.02]It's blocking itself out.
[15:08.06]This is probably the 3 right here.
[15:12.84]Also 4.
[15:13.80]1, 2, 3, 4.
[15:14.92]1, 2, 3, 4.
[15:16.86]That makes this a little easier.
[15:20.41]There's your 1.
[15:20.97]3.
[15:21.57]There's your 1 and your 2.
[15:22.81]This is 3.
[15:25.19]3 in the middle, right?
[15:25.97]There you go.
[15:26.73]Bingo.
[15:28.46]There's your 2.
[15:29.04]There's your other 2.
[15:30.66]Part of the 7.
[15:32.62]3, 3, 3.
[15:35.51]Looking good.
[15:41.01]1, 1, 3.
[15:41.27]This is also that 1.
[15:43.89]It has to be a 3 here.
[15:45.33]So it could be 1, 2, 3.
[15:46.27]It could be 3 here.
[15:47.33]Either this side or this side.
[15:48.75]Can't really tell right now.
[15:50.73]What's going on over here?
[15:51.65]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14.
[15:52.80]This might be already done here.
[15:54.00]Let's see.
[15:59.45]And then 1, 2, 3.
[15:59.87]1, 2, 3.
[16:00.26]Not quite.
[16:00.78]3 is definitely right here in the middle, though.
[16:06.08]It has to be.
[16:11.50]Same thing with the other one.
[16:15.20]That leaves us with... Let's just take a second here.
[16:17.39]These are all 4s down here.
[16:22.47]So because there's only 5 options, it's got to be all the ones in the bottom there.
[16:30.99]I would say the same thing here, unless we hold on one, two, three.
[16:34.47]And now it could be, it it's possible, although improbable, but still, it is still possible because up here is also a three, but it could be there.
[16:46.55]Somebody came in and said, what is happening?
[16:53.02]What are you doing?
[16:53.88]What is happening?
[16:55.90]One, two, three, one, two, three.
[16:59.30]Same deal.
[17:01.12]Does that help us over this way?
[17:05.44]2, 1.
[17:08.98]Down here is the 4.
[17:11.46]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[17:12.18]We know it's the two middle ones.
[17:16.91]Now is that the 2?
[17:17.85]This is the 1.
[17:21.45]This is also part of a 4.
[17:22.67]2, 4.
[17:27.49]So it's got to be these ones.
[17:30.95]That's a one.
[17:33.11]A one.
[17:35.23]Two, three, four again.
[17:37.37]What about here?
[17:38.29]Two, one.
[17:38.87]I got nothing here.
[17:41.74]One.
[17:43.30]Two.
[17:43.58]There it is.
[17:45.58]Simple.
[17:46.68]Absolute simple.
[17:48.84]Making a picture.
[17:49.48]Yeah.
[17:49.76]The way that Picross works is you build out with these logic puzzles a picture.
[17:56.84]If you do exclamation point guess, you can guess to see what it is.
[18:08.10]1, 1, 3.
[18:08.36]It could be this.
[18:13.67]1, 3, 2.
[18:16.51]No, this might be the 3.
[18:18.91]If that's the case.
[18:19.57]What about up top?
[18:23.44]2?
[18:25.96]Somewhere in here.
[18:26.54]1, 2, 3, 4.
[18:26.62]1, 2, 3, 4.
[18:29.22]I mean, it has to be the middle ones.
[18:38.98]This is definitely the one.
[18:40.92]There's two.
[18:43.00]And there's the other two.
[18:50.33]This is harder than Sekiro.
[18:53.57]Some of them can be really, really just challenging.
[18:55.49]That last one, I couldn't even... Sometimes you just sit there and look at it and it doesn't click.
[19:00.48]Nothing clicks on it.
[19:01.22]You just skip and go to another one.
[19:02.22]There's like hundreds of them.
[19:06.16]Hmm...
[19:11.72]Plane.
[19:12.14]Yeah, that was a plane rumor.
[19:15.23]Crashing by.
[19:17.61]Just flying by.
[19:18.61]2, 3, 4.
[19:19.37]Nothing there.
[19:24.09]Alright, so hold on.
[19:25.63]Wait, wait.
[19:26.13]This has to be 3.
[19:26.53]So if that's the case... Then it can't be any of these.
[19:35.40]Oh, shit.
[19:35.86]So this is definitely the 3.
[19:39.22]I'm thinking of 3s.
[19:39.58]There's still one up here.
[19:43.85]So is that enough info to figure that out?
[19:45.59]This, let's see, one.
[19:48.21]Yeah, that has to be there.
[19:50.45]Unless I made a mistake, which I don't think I did.
[19:54.89]And that's it for the four, all three fours.
[20:08.36]Somebody let me out of here, I'm in hell.
[20:11.08]You're okay.
[20:13.62]Now let's see.
[20:15.12]Yeah, this is it.
[20:20.27]One, one, one, two, three.
[20:21.47]One, two, three, four, two, one.
[20:27.92]Close, close.
[20:32.02]Mm-hmm.
[20:35.48]Could be either one.
[20:42.52]Still don't know about this side.
[20:46.76]Are they meant to be all white?
[20:48.62]Yeah, you'll see when it's complete, it turns into a colored picture.
[20:57.79]Is the one here or is the one here?
[20:59.23]Probably here.
[21:03.55]There's a five here.
[21:04.83]This is, okay, hold on.
[21:07.13]Let's just say two, one.
[21:11.14]One, two, three, four, five.
[21:13.68]No, the five is right here.
[21:18.10]There's the two, the five, here's the one, okay.
[21:21.83]These are all ones, except this one's a two.
[21:25.55]Done.
[21:26.49]There's your one, there's your two.
[21:29.11]Oh, it feels good.
[21:35.06]Then we got one, this is a two.
[21:39.02]And this is also a 2.
[21:40.40]That's part of the 11.
[21:41.34]11's done.
[21:41.64]I think I can get some more of these in here.
[21:48.07]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12.
[21:48.61]No, I can't.
[21:49.09]And it's just happening so quickly now.
[21:50.27]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[21:50.45]Middle can go.
[22:09.84]It's on its way.
[22:11.08]Alright.
[22:11.76]What is it?
[22:13.48]I don't know.
[22:17.77]Two.
[22:18.17]Let's see.
[22:18.53]Two.
[22:18.97]One.
[22:25.67]It's apparently a building.
[22:29.34]What is this?
[22:29.82]Four.
[22:31.14]Oh, there's a five.
[22:31.84]Here it is.
[22:37.56]So 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1, 3, 1, 1, 1.
[22:39.40]This is 11.
[22:39.82]Done.
[22:40.14]3.
[22:40.24]Got it.
[22:40.38]Done.
[22:40.64]This row is done.
[23:00.48]And then seven here, so seven.
[23:03.38]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten.
[23:06.59]Bingo.
[23:07.55]Done.
[23:11.91]The one is, one has to be right there.
[23:16.43]One, two, three.
[23:18.77]Eleven.
[23:21.14]And that's it.
[23:21.50]It is.
[23:23.56]A house?
[23:26.78]A house?
[23:29.51]A hut.
[23:30.65]Who got it?
[23:34.47]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10 of you got it.
[23:37.76]A hut.
[23:39.68]Nice work.
[23:41.84]So this is 15 by 15, but that's a lie.
[23:44.39]It's actually... That's 10.
[23:50.46]So this should be fairly easy to get a lot of these, because 8, 9, 10, the middle ones here.
[23:53.20]6, you know, 4 on the sides.
[23:53.84]So, 1, 2, 3, 4, 1, 2, 3, 4.
[23:56.18]7, 3.
[23:56.48]Okay, what about 5?
[23:57.26]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[23:57.64]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[23:59.48]Sorry, sir, you can't do that.
[24:01.04]11, though.
[24:18.06]is four on the sides.
[24:20.29]And we just have to count up to 15.
[24:25.81]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[24:27.81]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[24:30.65]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[24:32.87]I can't really do anything else.
[24:34.69]Alright, what have we got to work with here?
[24:38.15]Anything else?
[24:38.53]We've got six, eight, four, seven.
[24:42.15]One, two, three, four.
[24:43.55]X that one.
[24:44.35]One, two, three, four.
[24:45.29]It has to be up somewhere here.
[24:51.06]This is 11.
[24:53.33]Alright.
[24:57.27]So, 3, 8, 5, 1, 3.
[25:00.21]I wonder if this is the 5.
[25:02.31]Probably.
[25:05.07]And then if that's the 1.
[25:05.81]Got 1, 2, 3, maybe.
[25:07.55]Could go here.
[25:20.26]1, 2, 3.
[25:20.36]That has to be the second.
[25:22.20]This is definitely the second 3.
[25:26.24]Because there's not enough room for it there.
[25:27.78]1, 2, 3.
[25:28.02]1, 2, 3.
[25:28.16]3 is in here somewhere.
[25:35.27]Yeah, this kind of has to be the 5.
[25:37.37]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[25:40.65]Let's just clean it up.
[25:54.34]Any combinations here that I can do?
[25:58.60]I'm so mad Jeremy plays this.
[26:00.20]This was my secret game.
[26:01.90]Why are you mad that I enjoy a great, interesting, relaxing, fun game?
[26:07.86]Why is that making you mad?
[26:12.68]I'm so mad that Jeremy likes this.
[26:15.09]This is my thing.
[26:18.59]This is my secret game.
[26:24.92]Uh... 1, 4... I can get the 8 here, let's see.
[26:30.19]Okay, so let's just say... 1, 2, 3... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7... That's definitely the 4.
[26:42.59]I mean, that would be very odd if... That would be really odd if it was like this.
[26:46.58]You know what I mean?
[26:48.06]1, 2, 3, 4, 1...
[26:51.42]I don't believe that for a second.
[26:53.12]This is definitely the 4.
[26:56.72]If I'm wrong, that's fine.
[26:57.98]I'll be wrong.
[27:03.68]And the 1 is up here somewhere.
[27:07.94]So if this is the 8...
[27:13.80]3 is 1.
[27:13.94]Let's just say 1, 2, 3.
[27:14.50]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[27:15.44]It could be that.
[27:15.94]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[27:39.96]but even if it's this one two three four five six seven eight if this is it that's what's got yeah it has to be right here right you mean right that's wrong
[28:05.16]Wait, hold on.
[28:06.30]If this is the 4, then 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, hold on a second.
[28:09.88]I hope this is correct.
[28:11.74]Otherwise this whole thing is fucked up.
[28:23.19]This is probably a 1.
[28:29.19]1, 2, 3, 4.
[28:30.59]1, 2, 3, 4.
[28:33.59]Could be over here.
[28:34.10]I need to get rid of this shit first.
[28:36.48]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6.
[28:37.20]Got more info to fill that.
[28:42.97]Alright, well that's interesting, because now 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, you have to assume here now this is the 1, and there's a 3, there's 5, let's just make it, let's make it nice and simple on ourselves here.
[28:55.25]I either blew it or I didn't, it's pretty simple, you know what I mean?
[29:04.01]This is, this is probably wrong, but who knows.
[29:10.82]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8.
[29:12.61]I'm committing to have this being fucked up.
[29:17.31]We'll see.
[29:18.09]Yeah, it's all jacked up already.
[29:22.95]Shit.
[29:26.51]No, I committed to it.
[29:27.84]I committed and I should have.
[29:30.28]Damn it.
[29:32.72]See how I ice-created myself here?
[29:35.46]This is the outlier right there.
[29:46.15]If that's the case, then this can't... So is it five?
[29:49.65]That's not the five?
[29:52.99]No, the five, yeah.
[29:54.07]One, two, three, four.
[29:55.23]One, two, three, four, five.
[30:01.72]It's gotta be a one.
[30:08.36]Fuck, I blew it.
[30:12.16]It's alright, sometimes you blow it.
[30:13.32]Damn it, I thought I had that one too.
[30:16.96]Well, this is 13.
[30:27.43]I like when they give you a nice easy one.
[30:30.47]Two, four.
[30:33.17]Seven.
[30:34.25]Not enough spaces.
[30:37.10]One, two, three.
[30:38.42]One, two, three.
[30:42.26]Two somewhere up here.
[30:48.21]It all makes sense now.
[30:49.13]Thank you.
[30:50.80]Now anyway, this is... I can fill in a lot here.
[30:54.42]Because that's 15, 14, 13, 12.
[31:00.12]Can I get at least... Let's just start with that.
[31:04.22]10 is also... I can do a lot of these.
[31:07.30]10, 10.
[31:09.44]Anything that's 10 can be filled in down to here.
[31:12.18]And more than that.
[31:15.58]That was not a 10.
[31:16.72]So this is a 10.
[31:22.35]Let's see, six.
[31:24.11]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[31:27.78]One, two, three, yoink.
[31:29.44]One, two, three.
[31:30.14]Let's see, nine, 10, 11, 12.
[31:38.07]Guess Kim's cookies.
[31:41.71]They're delicious.
[31:47.21]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9.
[31:47.51]7, 8, 9.
[31:47.57]This is also part of the 9.
[31:48.57]Then 9.
[31:48.81]Speaking of 9.
[31:49.27]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[31:50.71]Okay, this is 6, 8.
[31:52.11]A lot of just big numbers here.
[31:55.67]Well, there has to be a 2, so...
[32:16.99]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[32:20.84]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[32:22.54]Space two.
[32:23.24]There's the two.
[32:24.20]And then there it is.
[32:25.10]Let's hope that's correct.
[32:27.72]The nine.
[32:28.78]Part of the two.
[32:30.24]There's two again.
[32:32.34]There's another two.
[32:33.62]There's all the threes.
[32:39.89]One, two, three.
[32:43.47]Uh.
[32:45.51]Meh.
[32:47.25]Two three, four five it's gotta be wearing right there What about down here one two, three, four five six seven Can't do anything with this Anyone know if I read the recommendations channel in Discord I do I do all the time One two, three, four five one two, three, four five
[33:19.90]I do read it frequently.
[33:23.16]How many more left here?
[33:24.30]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, 10.
[33:30.30]I can do this.
[33:34.60]This is done now.
[33:38.28]One, two, three, get it out of here.
[33:45.43]Three, one, two, three, nine, that's it, five,
[33:51.02]I think I know what this is.
[33:52.16]Or do I?
[33:53.56]It's weird that this is here.
[33:56.27]It looks like a heart.
[34:00.63]Seven, done.
[34:05.31]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[34:07.59]This is done.
[34:08.21]Close that up.
[34:16.26]uh I mean there's no way it's there that's like a symmetrical right it has to be there that's it for that 10. yeah this is pretty much a done deal right now so we got that done I think I can just fill these both in yeah there's the six yeah
[34:43.70]Yeah, but what uh, what kind of heart is this though?
[34:49.55]Is it just a heart what's with the top left?
[34:55.33]No, just a heart guess elephant I feel nice and slowed down.
[35:08.18]I do like another a couple more.
[35:09.34]Let's do like a few more
[35:12.57]This is another one of those slightly harder ones, I think.
[35:15.29]13, 14, 15.
[35:16.27]Yeah.
[35:16.71]Right down the middle there.
[35:18.71]3, 3.
[35:21.12]Let's see.
[35:21.90]This is probably 1, 4, 1, 1, 1.
[35:24.14]Anymore.
[35:24.56]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[35:28.74]5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[35:34.88]A few more hours?
[35:36.40]Nah.
[35:36.78]I'm probably going to skedaddle here in a little bit.
[35:38.46]I just want them to wind down a little.
[35:43.00]Let's see, 8.
[35:43.48]Are you already guessing animals?
[35:48.72]How are you already guessing this?
[35:52.94]3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10.
[35:54.46]Nothing that's close to 15.
[35:55.42]That's the only thing I can do is this one here.
[36:09.75]Uh...
[36:17.24]I think I can do that, right?
[36:23.47]Yeah, I can.
[36:26.05]Three.
[36:27.89]Two, no.
[36:28.79]This is definitely part of the three.
[36:29.95]This is the two, right?
[36:33.55]Yeah.
[36:37.55]Which then that makes this one, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[36:43.63]This is a one.
[36:45.79]Part of the eight.
[36:48.72]Interesting.
[36:51.40]This game makes me irrationally angry.
[36:53.50]I don't think that should be happening.
[36:59.68]I don't think that should be happening.
[37:01.78]I think you need to calm down a little.
[37:04.39]I could probably pull this tooth out if I tried hard enough.
[37:06.77]Don't pull your teeth out.
[37:09.89]Do not pull out your teeth.
[37:10.97]Please.
[37:16.03]Please.
[37:21.68]Five, two, one.
[37:22.61]This is part of three.
[37:25.97]This might be a one.
[37:30.79]If this is one, let's see, one, two, three, four.
[37:33.13]Let's see, one, two, three, four.
[37:38.95]One, two, three, four, one, one, two.
[37:41.82]Okay, one, two, three, four.
[37:44.30]One, one, this could be the four here.
[37:46.96]Although it's unlikely, but it could be.
[37:53.74]I'm gonna do it.
[37:54.32]Give me the pliers.
[37:55.98]No, sit down.
[38:00.84]Stop it.
[38:04.15]Give me the pliers.
[38:18.36]Shit.
[38:20.56]I'm stuck.
[38:22.14]I'm stuck.
[38:23.98]I don't know.
[38:24.54]I'm stuck.
[38:29.27]7, 8, 9, 10.
[38:31.91]I'm stuck right now.
[38:37.09]1, 2.
[38:37.93]1, 2, 3.
[38:43.17]Help me out here, guys.
[38:48.69]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[38:51.33]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[38:53.52]I think I can get this.
[39:01.38]Alright, I can get that.
[39:05.23]Two, three, this is three, three, three.
[39:09.15]One, two, three.
[39:10.69]One, two, three.
[39:19.28]Two.
[39:21.76]One, two, three.
[39:24.21]This could be the one.
[39:25.57]One, and then one, two, three.
[39:28.41]No, one.
[39:29.03]One, two.
[39:29.95]One, two, three.
[39:30.87]No, it's not.
[39:31.35]This is definitely the two.
[39:37.38]Devil May Cry 5, waiting room.
[39:39.04]We're not doing that tonight.
[39:43.54]It sounds like I'm trying to count to ten, but I can't do it.
[39:48.62]One, two, one, two, three.
[39:50.24]One, two, three.
[39:53.42]I don't know.
[39:56.90]Well, I can do something here.
[39:59.04]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[40:03.21]Something on the other side.
[40:04.03]One, two, three, four.
[40:11.10]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[40:17.17]Holy shit, this is part of the four.
[40:19.13]Really, one, two, three, four.
[40:20.89]Oh, I don't know.
[40:22.46]It could be any one of those numbers after eight.
[40:29.94]This changes this up a little.
[40:40.71]So six is now able to be done a little bit here.
[40:45.22]It's eight, so we can go like that.
[40:48.38]One, two, three.
[40:49.18]One, two, three, four.
[40:51.32]This is just counting.
[40:56.65]Yeah, that freed up some space with eight, because look at this, one, two.
[41:00.59]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine.
[41:03.49]Look at this.
[41:06.97]Look, I'm just gonna do it.
[41:08.37]I'm gonna punch myself as hard as I can in the face.
[41:15.69]Okay.
[41:26.78]This is meant to calm you down.
[41:31.18]That's right.
[41:31.48]I'm supposed to just be chilling and just shutting up and playing.
[41:34.44]I forgot.
[41:39.18]One, two, three.
[41:39.74]Okay, I can get rid of this.
[41:44.06]Doesn't help me for anything else, though.
[41:45.58]One, two, three, four, five, okay.
[42:01.40]That helps this, though, because if this is three, then I just figured that out.
[42:07.78]Smart guy.
[42:11.11]The question is, is this the three?
[42:14.70]I don't know.
[42:17.32]This might be the three.
[42:18.08]I think it is.
[42:18.64]I'm just going to say it is.
[42:20.80]Now I can do the four.
[42:22.48]One, two, three.
[42:24.48]Space.
[42:25.74]This has to be the three going up.
[42:28.06]Boing, boing.
[42:31.46]Please be right.
[42:33.22]I think it is.
[42:33.96]One, two, three, four.
[42:43.88]It's a head scratcher, this one.
[43:00.68]Five.
[43:01.70]Two.
[43:02.06]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven.
[43:05.48]Can't do anything with that.
[43:07.76]This eight, though.
[43:08.74]No.
[43:10.02]No.
[43:14.40]Am I going to go to church this Sunday?
[43:19.04]If that's what you do, then yeah.
[43:23.33]This is definitely part of it.
[43:24.25]Yeah, that's it.
[43:25.03]Let's close that out of here.
[43:26.27]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[43:29.99]Can I get three on both sides?
[43:31.91]I can.
[43:34.92]Nice.
[43:35.50]Yes!
[43:37.44]Oh, it feels great.
[43:48.60]This is awkward here.
[43:57.29]So 1, 4, right?
[44:02.45]It's not 1, 2, 3, 4, 1.
[44:03.61]That's part of the 4.
[44:08.10]So that's the first 1.
[44:09.78]Okay, that looks good.
[44:15.36]There's the second 2.
[44:24.09]Okay.
[44:25.61]What else we got here?
[44:30.07]Done.
[44:33.81]And then that makes... He's guessing?
[44:36.67]No, I'm not.
[44:39.32]That four had to be right there, and then the ones had to place this way, and that gave me the two, and that gave me the four.
[44:44.90]I'm not guessing on this one.
[44:54.61]two one that's definitely one that's also one oh wait oh no three three whoa I blew it oh it was going so well oh what did I do I really wasn't guessing though this is not correct here
[45:29.45]No.
[45:30.05]This is correct.
[45:34.94]I'm certain of that, but not here.
[45:39.76]But there's no way this is correct.
[46:05.11]Eight, right?
[46:08.39]There's the three.
[46:10.07]That's the only three.
[46:15.61]On this side at least, right?
[46:19.77]Alright, got it.
[46:24.78]Just uninstall it.
[46:29.88]No, wait, what do you mean no?
[46:30.94]No?
[46:38.97]Are you sure?
[46:39.45]Because that's... That looks pretty close.
[46:44.01]That would make complete sense.
[46:54.98]Because before I had it back here.
[46:57.24]Oh wait, no, but what the fuck is going on here?
[46:59.63]Oh no.
[47:07.83]This is the worst when you've oh god damn it no The right three crosses I guess no I didn't I just because this was empty and I figured it had to be the four and Shit No
[47:46.41]No, this is supposed to be making me happy!
[47:54.23]Let me see if I can fix this shit.
[48:22.59]How can I sleep with this Picross fail?
[48:27.01]Well, there's no way it's these, because this boar can't fit in here.
[48:32.34]Down?
[48:32.80]No, it's not down here either.
[48:36.32]Fuck.
[48:39.12]I might be too tired for this.
[48:41.28]And I do this while I'm tired.
[48:44.02]Oh, no.
[48:44.86]No, I had it too.
[48:47.76]It's the same shit I was saying when I played Sekiro.
[48:49.96]No, no, I had it.
[48:51.08]I gotta restart.
[48:52.12]I gotta redo it again from the beginning.
[48:54.26]Oh, fuck, I had it.
[49:06.12]This is correct.
[49:09.52]It is.
[49:10.65]Don't tell me it's not.
[49:11.75]I know it is.
[49:15.91]What's wrong?
[49:42.28]This whole row can't be incorrect.
[49:47.94]Unless, like, is... Is that what was just fucking me this whole time?
[50:04.06]Now, this is fucking wrong, though.
[50:08.05]You see?
[50:08.45]Like, 4, 1.
[50:09.39]1 can't be here.
[50:10.91]Something else is wrong.
[50:11.61]See what I'm saying?
[50:17.51]Like...
[50:25.24]I think this whole thing's fucked up.
[50:36.02]Because this is supposed to be 2, 1, which... Like, that's 2, 1, but... But then the 6, right?
[50:48.29]Like, there's no... How am I going to get the 6 in here?
[50:52.51]You know what I'm saying?
[50:53.97]There's no way.
[50:55.59]The six is not gonna fit in here.
[50:58.93]This whole thing is, what is this?
[51:01.27]What nice animal?
[51:06.69]Three, cause look, see?
[51:08.28]Nope.
[51:09.54]Nope.
[51:11.64]This, one.
[51:12.44]This is the only place where it can start.
[51:18.66]Five, and then two.
[51:19.82]Two's already done here.
[51:36.71]This one's done.
[51:38.31]Or no, at least like this part is.
[51:41.87]That's the three, five, two, where's the one go?
[51:44.77]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[51:47.97]See what's going on here?
[51:50.11]This is all messed up.
[51:57.06]Look at this.
[52:16.90]But look, we got a bigger problem down here.
[52:28.34]No.
[52:32.16]No.
[52:44.10]Fuck.
[52:53.02]One, one, two, three, four, five.
[52:55.02]I need one more.
[52:57.02]Six, but then this is fucking wrong.
[53:04.71]All these five, these two, two, two, two.
[53:06.93]I got, this is all, I screwed up something like a couple times and it's just over.
[53:18.49]I don't think there's something I can replace here to make this right.
[53:21.55]Because the 13 has to be here.
[53:25.95]You understand?
[53:27.01]The 5 is wrong, then.
[53:29.71]Because this has to be here.
[53:33.45]And then all this shit is wrong.
[53:55.27]Get me out of here!
[53:56.53]Fuck it!
[54:00.07]Harder than Sekiro, I fucked it up.
[54:03.15]God damn it.
[54:03.81]I'm going to bed.
[54:28.53]God damn it.
[54:29.67]I had it too.
[54:30.49]I'm just gonna relax.
[54:34.63]Yeah, this is relaxing me.
[54:38.02]My 40% capacity brain power right now is doing great.
[54:41.98]9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14...
[55:00.92]Not enough to get a whole roll.
[55:12.57]I need to calm down from this stressful de-stress.
[55:15.37]Yeah.
[55:31.59]Hey, calm down and go play some Sekiro.
[55:36.83]Uh... I actually probably should have just gone... I should have probably just ended the stream an hour ago when I was already tired enough to go to bed.
[55:44.59]Alright, let's see.
[55:54.50]Five, and then... One, two, three, four... Wait a minute.
[56:01.81]If that's... This is six.
[56:07.71]One, two, three, four, five.
[56:10.85]Four.
[56:12.01]No, one.
[56:13.59]One, two, three, four.
[56:14.85]Okay, that makes sense.
[56:28.26]He doesn't know how to count again.
[56:29.34]He's losing his mind.
[56:34.43]He beat Sekiro, can't beat Picross.
[56:38.07]No, I can.
[56:38.87]I can do it.
[56:49.05]I'm gonna, like, just go hold my head underwater in the bath, in, like, the bathtub.
[56:53.19]No, no, no, listen, listen.
[56:54.26]Like, I'm talking about, like, go take a bath.
[56:56.28]Go take a bath, listen.
[57:00.60]I'm gonna go take a bath and just like relax and like put my head under and get the warmth and then come back out.
[57:06.18]You didn't let me finish.
[57:10.69]That's not how you bathe.
[57:11.69]Yes, you do.
[57:12.11]You go back and like go under just for like two seconds and then come out.
[57:18.41]And you're you baptize yourself.
[57:28.20]Alright, we've got eight.
[57:30.12]So obviously the eight has to be here.
[57:33.18]So we've got one, two, three.
[57:34.60]Let's see.
[57:36.28]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[57:40.20]Pretty good.
[57:42.75]That would make sense here.
[57:45.85]And then the two is down here somewhere.
[57:48.91]Because that's correct.
[57:50.17]Yeah, it is.
[57:51.01]I know what I'm doing.
[57:53.45]I know what I'm doing.
[57:56.67]Five, five.
[58:02.92]Let's see.
[58:04.12]One, two, three, four, five.
[58:05.52]I can do this.
[58:17.69]It's probably the same thing.
[58:25.78]It's baptized.
[58:26.90]Yeah, I'm gonna go baptize myself in like the warm cooling waters of the bathtub.
[59:06.28]Yeah, it's the cooling waters of the bath.
[59:12.79]This is four.
[59:18.69]In fact, I might just fucking flip the table over here in Monopoly and just go do it now.
[59:33.04]I went into like the 15 by 15 pick Ross.
[59:35.94]Should've just did like the 10 by 10.
[59:36.84]Let me see.
[59:37.34]Three, one.
[59:44.48]No.
[60:08.17]Do a 50x51 in a bath.
[60:12.99]I honestly think Isshin might have dropped my IQ by like 8 points.
[60:17.81]I mean that permanently.
[60:27.04]To beat Sekiro, I had to drop my IQ by 10 points.
[60:34.12]I used it all.
[60:34.80]You know how you have like... Okay, I used some life consumables.
[60:40.26]Take 10 years or 10 points of IQ off life, but gain 30 straight seconds of utter complete focus.
[60:46.72]I used it.
[60:58.06]Perishables.
[61:02.11]He's activated Jex too many times.
[61:03.73]You guys know in, like, fucking time travel movies and TV shows where they, like, their nose is bleeding and they keep using the time travel.
[61:12.53]And eventually, like, they go fucking, like, wacky.
[61:16.16]They've lost their mind because they've done it too many times.
[61:20.36]I think I may have activated Jex too many times.
[61:33.07]This happens in click.
[61:42.67]Have fun.
[61:43.99]I'm gonna just relax.
[61:56.50]I used my back-in-time powers too much.
[62:05.56]If you guys do this, I'll do another Minecraft VR stream.
[62:08.18]You have five minutes.
[62:11.22]I don't know why that's making me laugh so hard.
[62:29.63]You have until 11.
[62:32.45]You can't cheat either.
[62:43.98]Yeah, I'm sorry, I got no brain power left.
[62:47.82]It's gone.
[62:53.33]I'm gonna admit when I, you know, I'm just gonna admit defeat when I have to.
[62:58.25]All of it's gone.
[63:06.85]Jeremy lied about Minecraft VR.
[63:08.27]Five more community subs.
[63:09.69]You've been insane tonight with these community subs.
[63:12.85]Thank you.
[63:22.42]You guys have until 8?
[63:25.20]9, 10, 11, 12, 13.
[63:26.08]I'll give you guys until 15 minutes.
[63:29.82]No cheating.
[63:37.81]You have until the clock on the top right strikes 15.
[63:42.37]We start the board.
[63:43.13]That's not part of the deal.
[63:51.69]We ain't got no damn idea.
[63:56.00]No, some of you guys know what's going on.
[64:06.34]Restart the board, fucker.
[64:07.90]Fine.
[64:09.37]Fine.
[64:09.81]I'll give that to you.
[64:12.15]But you just consumed two of your brain cell minutes.
[64:15.25]So now you have five minutes to do it.
[64:18.53]You used your power.
[64:20.05]Don't use it too many times.
[64:46.62]Alright, fine.
[64:47.02]You got until seven minutes.
[64:48.30]I'll give it back.
[64:49.76]I cleared the board.
[64:50.46]You have seven minutes.
[64:59.19]And then the stream's over.
[65:01.83]I gotta go take a break.
[65:02.79]I gotta go take a shower.
[65:05.67]Eat some food.
[65:09.61]Good luck, though, guys.
[65:10.31]I really hope you get it.
[65:18.87]I promised Minecraft, yeah, if you guys, if you guys do this, by the time it's seven minutes, I will do another episode of JermaCraft VR.
[65:30.90]I said seven minutes.
[65:31.94]I did make it six minutes.
[65:33.34]I just gave you an extra minute.
[65:36.28]I'm not lying.
[65:37.46]Do it.
[65:38.48]Keep me honest.
[65:52.42]That's the thing, the 15x15s are, like, some of them are very difficult.
[65:58.61]Most Picross puzzles top out at around 15x20, 20x20, 25x25 is really kind of pushing it for difficulty.
[66:11.40]There are a lot, there are some Picross puzzles that go more than 25x25 or 20x20, but they're
[66:17.55]It's like doing a thousand-piece jigsaw puzzle.
[66:20.95]At some point, you're just like, eh, I kind of want to just do a quick one.
[66:26.00]30 by 30s, yeah.
[66:27.48]They take a while, though.
[66:28.46]They can take upwards of like an hour.
[66:36.00]Especially some of the ones that are more than 30 to 40, or 40 by 40.
[66:50.12]What are y'all even trying to do?
[66:59.65]They're trying to make a full square.
[67:01.01]They do it every time.
[67:03.81]40x40 is 1600 pieces.
[67:05.65]It's a lot, yeah.
[67:09.17]Takes a while.
[67:15.85]Is it 1600?
[67:18.97]No, it's not.
[67:19.91]Is it?
[67:20.99]How many are here in 15x15?
[67:28.89]You guys have plenty of time to get this fixed.
[67:37.72]But, for those of you that are sticking around, that's the end of the stream.
[67:41.28]Sekiro was really the only thing I wanted to finish tonight.
[67:46.97]Yeah, it is 1600 now.
[67:51.39]You will see me again.
[67:53.02]We're gonna play Monster Rancher.
[67:54.26]We're gonna start with Monster Rancher 4, and if it sucks, we're gonna go back to Monster Rancher 2.
[68:00.26]All the Sekiro people already left.
[68:01.58]Yeah, I know.
[68:03.30]Thanks for sticking around, guys.
[68:05.26]Just dicking around in Picross and watching me have another Meltdown.
[68:10.07]Meltdown 2.
[68:17.47]Give us until you finish reading bits?
[68:19.59]Okay.
[68:19.69]Okay.
[68:21.16]That sounds like a fair assessment here.
[68:24.44]Let's see, how many bits do we have?
[68:26.42]Okay, no, that's fair.
[68:30.26]I wish you luck.
[68:37.95]So, Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[68:41.57]Five more community subs.
[68:42.75]My god.
[68:47.21]Thank you so much.
[68:51.16]so many community subs super seal thanks for the 250 just letting you know there's going to be a temporary TF2 man versus machine update I mean temporary operation memes versus machines oh yeah alright just the title alone is kind of like yeah I don't know about that
[69:17.98]That's on the official Team Fortress post, yeah.
[69:20.11]Memes versus machines.
[69:26.01]Might be interesting, but maybe not.
[69:27.79]Who knows?
[69:30.77]But thank you, SuperSeal, for the heads up there.
[69:32.57]SadVega, thanks for the 250.
[69:33.81]Oh my god, Jeremy, you missed so much shit.
[69:35.81]No joke, you're gonna have to play the whole game again.
[69:38.04]You should do as much as you can before you get to Jinichiro and fight him.
[69:41.76]Also, could you kill those poor castle grandmas?
[69:44.82]I did that parent and didn't hurt a single one.
[69:49.40]I did that parent and didn't hurt a single one.
[69:53.00]They just cry and curl into a ball if you look at them.
[69:55.20]You horrible monster.
[69:58.21]I feel like I did...
[70:01.08]I missed a lot of shit.
[70:01.76]But yeah, but aren't there two or three different ways you can go through the game?
[70:06.92]I was under the assumption that some of the choices I was making changed the whole game.
[70:14.86]And you can't really go back and redo them, right?
[70:17.54]There's four endings.
[70:20.88]And on a first playthrough, it's, you know, kind of just need to do it, you know?
[70:29.74]But thank you, SadVega.
[70:30.66]Kind of depressing, but keep making people laugh.
[70:33.62]I'm really, really fucking sorry to hear that.
[71:01.01]Making people laugh, telling jokes, and enjoying experiences with people is one of my favorite things in the world.
[71:09.65]Having fun together is my favorite thing on Earth.
[71:19.62]I'm really, really terribly sorry to hear about that, Holo1Zombie.
[71:30.40]I'm happy that you can hang out here and make jokes and give some joy to other people.
[71:42.03]Thank you so much for the $5.
[71:42.81]How you guys doing?
[71:57.78]Yeah, you're actually not really doing that bad.
[72:00.95]You're starting to get it.
[72:06.36]A Frodean weapon.
[72:07.22]Thanks for the $5, Frodean.
[72:08.40]Superb Shinobi Execution.
[72:10.30]Jerma checks.
[72:10.82]I think that was for the Demon of Hatred.
[72:19.08]But thank you, Frodean.
[72:20.66]And they say $2.50 from Frodean again.
[72:22.12]You're doing a great job.
[72:24.41]I'm trying.
[72:24.87]I'm trying.
[72:28.01]Securo was fine.
[72:30.25]Did he beat the final boss?
[72:31.15]Yes.
[72:31.91]I completed Sekiro.
[72:33.47]It is done.
[72:35.63]Something or other thanks to the 250.
[72:36.66]Hey, Jerm, saw you at the bowling alley the other day trying to get the bowling shoes over your regular clown shoes.
[72:41.66]I noticed that you would let out a high-pitched scream whenever someone tried to help, so I figured I'd offer a piece of advice now that I'm not within earshot.
[72:50.95]Why not put the bowling shoes on first, then put the clown shoes on over them, since the clown shoes are bigger?
[72:56.99]Smiley face.
[72:59.03]That's a good tip.
[73:00.94]That's a really good tip.
[73:01.84]I'll probably check.
[73:02.62]I'll probably do that next time.
[73:05.70]In this imaginary scenario that you made up.
[73:12.50]$50.
[73:12.54]I missed this earlier.
[73:13.57]I was really, really focused and intense.
[73:16.81]And I missed a $50 donation.
[73:18.19]I don't know if you still hear fudge44.
[73:19.91]It was 5,000 bits.
[73:24.97]I'm really sorry I didn't catch this when it first came through.
[73:29.18]But I'm not sure if you're still here.
[73:31.00]Maybe not.
[73:31.30]This was about four hours ago, so... Thank you, regardless.
[73:37.24]They say, hey Jerma, stumbled across your channel years ago when you were playing Battlefield 3 with Pwnstar and have been a fan since.
[73:45.83]Now that is a long time ago.
[73:48.31]Just want to say thanks for getting me into TF2 and volunteering at an elementary school.
[73:52.54]Got inspired by your video on working at an animal shelter.
[73:55.70]About to finish university and recently got my first job, so finally have the money to show my appreciation for all the entertainment and advice.
[74:02.61]Sorry it's taken so long for me to give something back.
[74:05.33]You already gave something back.
[74:07.91]By watching.
[74:10.53]The amount of people that watch these streams, collectively all of you, have given me more than anything I could ever ask for in my life.
[74:18.36]Everything I've ever dreamed of.
[74:21.00]Doing entertainment.
[74:22.37]Doing, like, jokes and comedy and bits and... That's the number one thing I've wanted in my entire life.
[74:31.69]And you've given it to me, so... That's worth way more than money.
[74:37.27]Thank you.
[74:44.86]You guys just filled row A. Well, you got a little bit more time.
[74:54.80]Hanging out and doing broadcasting and doing, like, videos and shit, something that I've always wanted to do.
[75:00.20]So thank you for letting me fulfill my... the goal of my whole entire existence.
[75:07.38]It's worth way more than a dollar.
[75:12.44]Thank you.
[75:14.78]And when I say dollar, I don't mean a dollar that you get 50.
[75:17.42]I'm talking about just, like, the dollar.
[75:23.14]Thank you so much.
[75:25.73]Penquin, thanks for the $5, Penquin.
[75:27.29]I would help you, Jerma, but I have... This is like a thing where the streamer says the thing, right?
[75:35.75]No, is this?
[75:36.41]I don't know.
[75:42.84]Lumbago?
[75:46.40]What is that?
[75:47.12]I've heard it.
[75:51.22]I would help you, Jerma, but I have Lumbago.
[75:52.88]Who says that?
[75:53.54]Somebody says that.
[75:58.39]Oh, it's from Red Dead.
[75:59.85]Right.
[76:04.23]I thought it was like the other one.
[76:07.04]Yeah, Sakura really has just taken up 100% of my time here.
[76:21.57]I haven't really had an opportunity.
[76:22.63]And I'm sick, too.
[76:24.61]I spent a couple days last week sick, so I haven't really been focusing on it.
[76:29.98]But yes, there's going to be a lot of new shit soon.
[76:34.54]Soon, soon, soon.
[76:36.86]But thank you, Flank Tank.
[76:41.04]Djack, thanks for the 250.
[76:42.26]Well done, Sekiro.
[76:44.46]Well done.
[76:45.82]I got through it.
[76:47.64]Tingy thinks of the 250.
[76:48.80]Is this the guy who beat Sekiro on stream?
[76:52.99]It is not.
[76:54.79]As of the end of this broadcast, yes it is.
[76:56.35]It is not.
[76:58.21]We get to say that now.
[77:00.87]Thank you, Tingy.
[77:03.26]Thank you, HaveGun, for the 250.
[77:05.00]I was there when Jerma defeated Grandpa and became his own man.
[77:17.33]Uh, you guys.
[77:18.73]Again with the A. Some people just want to watch the world burn.
[77:24.66]That's the scenario there.
[77:28.68]Ah, Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[77:30.34]I hate that.
[77:31.12]Clip it.
[77:33.02]I wonder what you were referring to.
[77:41.59]Thank you, IronDude, for the $5.00.
[77:43.21]Congrats, Jerma.
[77:43.93]Thank you.
[77:48.41]Thank you so much for the $5, Iron Dude.
[77:50.39]CluelessSniper, thanks for $2.50.
[77:51.73]Hey, Jerma, now that you've beaten Sekiro, what are your favorite From bosses?
[77:57.93]Uh... Hmm.
[78:03.61]Ludwig is number one, always.
[78:06.61]I don't think any boss in this game topped how I felt when I played Ludwig for the first time.
[78:13.26]Um...
[78:14.98]The Fountainhead Dragon was really, really awesome.
[78:18.39]Scale-wise, probably the biggest boss they've done, which was just awesome to see.
[78:22.19]Really, really interesting design.
[78:26.35]That's probably up there for coolest looking and most interesting art direction-wise.
[78:37.26]I'm trying to think if I would put any...
[78:42.32]I'm trying to think of before... It's hard to remember every boss from the whole... Like 150 bosses across this whole company's lineup here.
[78:56.39]Who's my favorite?
[78:57.17]Let me just think about my favorite bosses from the whole series in general.
[79:00.47]Dark Souls 1.
[79:02.91]My favorite boss from Dark Souls... Or my favorite boss from Demon's Souls... Was probably...
[79:10.70]The last fight.
[79:12.30]That was a lot of fun.
[79:15.54]Fighting against the guy with the sword that dashed around, and he was really, really cool.
[79:19.20]I forget what his name was.
[79:25.47]I think in Sekiro, the first fight against Genichiro was maybe my favorite.
[79:36.84]Now that I have a chance to sit here and think about it.
[79:43.54]No, no, no, not the tutorial one.
[79:45.08]I'm talking about like the first when you beat him and he like falls over the balcony.
[79:49.47]Just that fight was just really, really fun.
[79:51.37]It felt very fluid.
[79:55.15]Old King Allant is that boss from Demon's Souls.
[79:56.95]Yeah, that was definitely one of my favorites.
[80:02.41]Dark Souls 2.
[80:05.51]I feel like there was a boss every 30 minutes in Dark Souls 2, so it's hard to remember.
[80:13.82]Who was my favorite boss from Dark Souls 2?
[80:28.27]I don't know.
[80:31.87]Maybe not necessarily favorite fight, but the two people that were back-to-back, that were connected, that would fold on top of each other and you'd fight one and they would do like a little cartwheel.
[80:44.41]I don't know if I liked that fight, but I liked how that boss looked.
[80:50.29]They had the two scimitars.
[80:51.49]The sentry, yeah.
[80:55.59]That was just a really interesting mechanic.
[81:03.36]In regards to just how it looks and how cool it was.
[81:07.92]Dark Souls 3 is...
[81:14.57]Honestly?
[81:15.78]Probably Pontiff.
[81:19.40]I just love his animations.
[81:20.38]They're so cool.
[81:21.54]He was just so fun to watch.
[81:28.38]His... The two blades that he has were just... And oh no, Gale.
[81:33.39]Gale was unbelievable.
[81:34.67]That... Oh man.
[81:36.13]That's tricky.
[81:36.73]That might be one of my favorite... That's my favorite fight, like, ever.
[81:39.77]Huh.
[81:39.91]Huh.
[81:43.62]Gale, yeah, Gale Ludwig, I think is still higher than anything from Sekiro for me.
[81:57.06]Sekiro was more about fighting other people, for the most part.
[82:03.95]There was a couple of extravagant, ridiculous enemies, but for the most part, the major enemies in Sekiro are, I'm also a guy, and I've got a sword too.
[82:14.61]So it's hard to make the comparison between Gale or Ludwig versus something like Owl.
[82:21.52]It's kind of just your dad.
[82:28.67]Fight-wise, they were brilliant.
[82:31.03]But I guess it's hard to overcome the way that I felt when you get to Phase 3 of Gale.
[82:41.27]It's just... It's so... Everything just clicks.
[82:45.35]Everything looks so interesting.
[82:47.47]He has a really, really cool moveset.
[82:49.33]I don't know.
[82:49.93]It would be tough between Gale and Ludwig.
[83:00.07]They're all good.
[83:04.24]Most of the Sekiro bosses were dudes with swords.
[83:06.50]It kind of had to be like that though.
[83:08.46]Because in a game that's based around parrying, deflecting, and, you know, posture and swordplay, you... They really... Then they tried.
[83:17.63]You know, they gave like the ape, the giant ape, a sword and he was stabbing and... They did do a good job with that, but you kind of have to have it be a game about swordplay.
[83:42.38]But then you move on to Bloodborne, and Bloodborne is just a perfect video game.
[83:49.20]There's so many bosses.
[83:50.80]I have such fond memories of a shitload of those bosses.
[83:55.75]The research facility is one of my favorite zones in any video game.
[84:00.75]Drip drop, drip drop, drip drop.
[84:02.45]Like, that place was fucking crazy.
[84:05.13]I loved that place.
[84:07.17]I wish I could just play Bloodborne 2.
[84:17.47]The DLC in Bloodborne was the best DLC that FromSoftware has ever made.
[84:23.67]Regardless of a copy and paste couple of boss fights, the DLC was the best they've done, ever.
[84:30.08]It was perfect.
[84:32.26]Well, not perfect, because I just told you that they, you know, they copy-pasted a boss or two.
[84:40.35]We'll see if they come up with some DLC for this game, because they've been pretty on point with it so far, the last, like, five years.
[84:48.64]Lady Maria was just absolutely phenomenal.
[84:52.02]Ludwig, absolutely fucking phenomenal.
[84:57.18]Yeah, I wanna like go back and play it again.
[85:03.39]Orphan was... next level, almost like the... yeah.
[85:10.97]What a great game.
[85:15.12]I still hold it to a higher regard than Sekiro.
[85:20.30]Sekiro's pretty close, though.
[85:21.50]I think Sekiro's better than Dark Souls 3.
[85:26.02]Just as an entire, the whole package.
[85:28.14]Mmm, it's tough.
[85:34.05]Ah, the memories.
[85:35.21]But, hopefully that answers your question.
[85:38.31]Sad Vega, thanks for the 250.
[85:39.13]Congratulations on getting the bad end.
[85:41.89]I hope you do better next time.
[85:44.07]Oh man, wait till you see the actual final boss.
[85:50.38]Congratulations on the bad end.
[85:53.60]Nioh is better than all of them?
[85:54.79]I just go- Okay, I'm gonna be- Here's a confession here.
[85:58.47]Yes, I play every- Oh, dude, go back to Nioh!
[86:01.27]Oh, you know, you were just like shitfaced.
[86:02.69]You would like it.
[86:04.09]Offstream, I- Like a year ago or so, I did try to just play Nioh offstream.
[86:14.48]I just- I didn't like it.
[86:18.00]I was- I just didn't- It didn't click.
[86:28.76]I don't know what it was about it, the gameplay is fun, the environment's interesting, just something about it was not clicking with me.
[86:40.31]Neo looks lame compared to Sekiro.
[86:48.67]The way your character moved around is I think what I had the biggest problem with in Neo.
[86:56.28]Like, the way that the dodges worked, and it was just, it felt very, um, it's hard to describe.
[87:01.57]You guys did it.
[87:07.90]Look.
[87:08.74]You made a bow and arrow.
[87:16.72]But thank you, SadVega.
[87:17.46]Thank you, DubskyDude, for the 250.
[87:18.82]You are a gaming god.
[87:20.82]My heart was pounding during that last stretch.
[87:22.89]Didn't think you were gonna make it.
[87:24.11]Neither did I. This game wasn't made for human beings, but you beat it.
[87:27.45]Have my bit so I can finally say that I gave a sweaty internet goblin $100 in total.
[87:31.59]You deserve it.
[87:32.11]Thank you.
[87:35.20]Thank you, DubskyDude.
[87:37.82]I didn't think I was gonna make it either.
[87:43.10]I had so much self-doubt.
[87:46.20]Going into half of those attempts.
[87:50.38]Ugh.
[87:52.52]52 attempts.
[87:53.94]Dear God.
[87:55.96]I guarantee I can tell you how, like, 38 of them went.
[88:00.33]Oh my God.
[88:02.41]Fuck no.
[88:03.15]Just redo it.
[88:05.47]Ready?
[88:06.35]Let's turn the audio off.
[88:07.63]I want you to, like, maybe somebody, like, just super, like, impose me over.
[88:10.16]Ready?
[88:10.30]Ready?
[88:13.06]Here is absolutely at least 15 to 20 of those attempts.
[88:20.34]No, I'm just gonna go.
[88:20.92]I'm gonna try it.
[88:21.34]Okay.
[88:25.12]Fucking god damn it.
[88:29.04]It's just fucking insane.
[88:30.44]It's just insane.
[88:34.03]I don't want to do this part.
[88:37.29]Oh my fucking god.
[88:39.31]Jesus Christ.
[88:42.93]Always hits me with that bullshit.
[88:44.97]Yeah, that's a good one.
[88:46.17]Always hits me with that bullshit.
[88:47.67]I forgot about that one.
[88:52.10]What a stupid fucking mechanic.
[88:54.68]Honestly, why?
[88:56.92]Why?
[88:57.40]I'm so close to the wall.
[89:03.00]There's nothing I can even do.
[89:03.96]Okay.
[89:11.50]Someone just said, I just came back.
[89:14.28]What?
[89:23.53]But impose me.
[89:24.51]Ready?
[89:25.67]Oh my god.
[89:28.09]No.
[89:29.25]No.
[89:30.67]No.
[89:32.91]Fucking my god.
[89:34.99]Oh my fucking god.
[89:37.92]Give me a fucking break.
[89:40.18]I probably said that four or five hundred times in the last three hours of the stream.
[89:49.30]He's raging at stuff that doesn't exist in Picross.
[89:52.42]Is this guy, like, on fucking drugs?
[90:00.16]Hey, PikaBanana, thanks for the 30 bucks, 30 dollars from PikaBanana.
[90:03.84]Congrats, Jeremiah.
[90:04.48]I'm so glad I could watch you beat the game live.
[90:06.86]It was so much fun to watch.
[90:09.20]Thanks for sticking around.
[90:09.82]Thanks for hanging out.
[90:11.72]I know some of these new games that have a lot of hype behind them.
[90:15.56]A lot of people maybe don't want to see just because they plan on playing it themselves.
[90:19.66]So those of you that have really stuck around the whole time, I hope you enjoyed it.
[90:24.19]Thanks for hanging out the whole time.
[90:26.07]Well, for, you know, however long you were here.
[90:28.65]Thank you for the $30, PikaBanana.
[90:29.63]Appreciate it.
[90:31.87]zero giblets thanks for three bucks you did great Jerma thanks for the stream I have to ask what is your new scale of favorites for from games you mentioned favorite bosses thanks again you ready here we go Dark Souls 2 at the bottom let's but this is going up right I would say Dark Souls 2
[90:59.72]I'm not going to make a lot of people upset with this, but... Dark Souls 2.
[91:06.73]Dark Souls 1.
[91:10.81]No, no, no, no.
[91:11.57]Dark Souls 2.
[91:12.31]Dark Souls 3.
[91:18.38]Dark Souls 1.
[91:20.72]Sekiro.
[91:21.62]Demon's Souls.
[91:22.20]Bloodborne.
[91:22.60]There you go.
[91:23.02]Done.
[91:24.22]Done.
[91:31.70]In that order going up.
[91:40.98]I loved Demon's Souls.
[91:44.99]Yeah, Demon's Souls is that high.
[91:46.37]I just loved it.
[91:53.05]Do it again, but this time coherent.
[91:54.51]Okay.
[91:56.69]Dark Souls 2...
[92:01.02]Then, Dark Souls 3, Dark Souls 1, Sekiro, Demon's Souls, Bloodborne.
[92:08.88]The thing about, you could probably, Sekiro could probably overtake Demon's Souls.
[92:16.73]I mean, I just did play Demon's Souls.
[92:19.05]I mean, I did, well actually I did, like last year.
[92:29.71]Here, look, here I go.
[92:30.99]I'll write it out.
[92:35.92]Here we go.
[92:36.16]I'll hear you, official.
[92:53.51]I would probably say Demon's Souls and Sekiro are probably equal for me right now.
[93:08.49]What am I lagging for?
[93:13.58]OK, here we go.
[93:14.16]Ready?
[93:24.73]He's typing really slow.
[93:26.07]That didn't even come close.
[93:32.39]Let me see.
[93:36.35]29 minutes in this shit you guys have?
[93:42.17]There you go.
[93:42.87]I fixed it.
[93:43.31]30 minutes are gone.
[93:44.16]That's it.
[93:45.04]Guess what?
[93:46.82]I'll give you a consolation prize.
[94:00.11]I'll play Minecraft VR again.
[94:07.50]Not as long this time.
[94:14.66]I'll watch a Minecraft video.
[94:21.51]I'll watch a Minecraft related video.
[94:28.50]Today?
[94:28.84]No, not today.
[94:31.42]And there you go.
[94:31.96]Look at this.
[94:32.30]Let's see how... Wow, what happened on March 26th?
[94:33.68]Honest to God, look at that.
[94:34.38]I was on point on the 26th, apparently.
[94:35.56]I must have had my fucking vitamins.
[95:05.22]What bosses, what areas were the 26th?
[95:14.77]Was it the ape?
[95:15.39]I would expect that would be way less, I mean way more.
[95:21.69]That's cool though.
[95:24.11]63, 52 of them were the final boss.
[95:28.17]Jerma lied about Minecraft VR.
[95:29.43]Another five community subs.
[95:30.63]You are... What are you at now?
[95:33.53]115 total in the channel.
[95:35.02]You've given 115 community subs.
[95:38.90]Thank you, Jerma.
[95:39.88]Lied about Minecraft VR.
[95:43.36]That's a lot.
[95:46.20]But thank you, Tingy.
[95:48.09]For the 250.
[95:49.33]And for keeping track.
[95:50.61]You and Jesse got it.
[95:53.31]It's cool to see it.
[95:55.03]Djack, thanks for the 250.
[95:56.27]So, quick first impression.
[95:59.38]Game's not even fun.
[96:01.48]It's like the least amount of fun I've ever had.
[96:11.39]Thank you, though.
[96:11.79]Thank you, Wavelet, for the $4.20.
[96:13.23]Congrats on beating the game, Jerma.
[96:15.24]The last boss fight, Stage 3, with no healing pots or reses left, was intense.
[96:19.46]Pog.
[96:21.98]Yeah.
[96:26.93]I'm just remembering that fight.
[96:31.81]It's a lot.
[96:32.85]It's a lot of fun.
[96:39.78]Thank you Snooze and Copter for the $2.50.
[96:41.62]Have I seen this video?
[96:46.02]This video.
[96:48.25]Yeah, this is the Jerma Defoe one with the painting.
[96:51.75]You know, some people say it looks like me.
[96:54.47]Yeah, I watched it on stream before.
[96:56.35]Here.
[96:57.97]We have seen this one.
[97:01.16]And then they said, I was curious how you and Kim met.
[97:05.22]How did you get to know each other?
[97:09.88]Uh, we met at a Christmas party.
[97:12.19]And then... I... We just started texting.
[97:18.83]We hooked up at the Christmas party, right?
[97:22.86]So it was already kind of like, oh, okay, we'll talk again.
[97:28.88]We started texting back and forth, and then it was like, hey, come over.
[97:31.56]You want to come over?
[97:32.42]Yeah.
[97:35.40]We watched, like, fucking Iron Chef for three hours, and that was it.
[97:46.34]Boring lore.
[97:53.47]What do you mean boring lore?
[97:54.71]Yeah, everyone, Jeremiah, I got like, what, you got any like tips, like relationship tips?
[98:04.39]Or, you know, how do I, what, give me some, are there any tips, give me some secrets on how to get, Food Network chose.
[98:13.16]Iron Chef.
[98:14.24]Hell's Kitchen.
[98:15.34]Kitchen Nightmares.
[98:18.19]There is no better thing to watch when you're on a date.
[98:22.55]You want to know why?
[98:24.00]Because it never fucking ends.
[98:26.38]And you don't have to think of the awkward moment where, oh, let's watch this movie.
[98:32.40]An hour and 30 minutes went by.
[98:33.80]It's over.
[98:34.74]Oh, fuck.
[98:35.45]Now what the hell am I going to do?
[98:36.89]What the hell are we going to talk about?
[98:38.41]There's like 6,000 episodes of Iron Chef across regions of the Earth.
[98:45.29]There's like 2,000 Japanese episodes.
[98:47.75]And then they ported it to America and there's like 3,000 American episodes.
[98:51.57]You can just leave it on.
[98:52.99]And just figure out what you're gonna do.
[99:01.58]But then she'll go, I gotta go now, it's getting late.
[99:04.79]Yeah, but, like, you have so many opportunities to, like, talk, and it's not just, like, the movie ends or the TV show ends.
[99:12.46]Everybody expects... Look, when you go into it, you turn on Iron Chef, you're not just going to watch one episode.
[99:18.68]That's not how it works.
[99:19.84]You're going to watch at least eight.
[99:23.02]Otherwise, you're not going to watch it at all.
[99:24.93]So you know what you're getting into.
[99:33.74]Nobody goes, hey, yeah, like Iron Chef.
[99:35.74]Oh, yeah, that sounds like a cool idea.
[99:37.18]One episode, done.
[99:38.24]That's, I'm done.
[99:39.78]No.
[99:42.02]It would be weird if you were to turn that off after two episodes.
[99:47.94]Telling you, Iron Chef.
[99:50.79]And there's plenty to talk about.
[99:51.83]There's so many interesting things and food and, wow, he burnt the chicken.
[99:55.51]Oh, my God.
[99:56.93]Kimmy burnt the chicken.
[99:58.33]Can you believe it?
[100:00.12]No, I can't.
[100:00.64]He burned... I know, it's unbelievable.
[100:03.12]He's gonna get points deducted from that.
[100:04.84]You can't do that during a movie.
[100:09.39]Try doing that during a movie.
[100:12.55]He just got shot in the chest.
[100:13.63]Kim, he got shot in the chest, Kim.
[100:15.55]Yeah, he got shot.
[100:16.53]Yeah, oh, he just like... John Wick just punched that guy.
[100:18.80]Did you see John Wick?
[100:19.60]Yeah, John Wick just like threw him across the bridge.
[100:21.68]Yeah.
[100:22.60]No, you're gonna sit there quiet, awkward, and silent.
[100:25.78]You can do full-on commentary during a Food Network show.
[100:32.35]This is an NPC conversation.
[100:38.17]That's my biggest relationship tip.
[100:41.75]Iron Chef.
[100:42.53]That's all I got to say.
[100:49.56]Hey, we got your earlier Richard pillow.
[100:51.06]Thanks for the $5.
[100:51.66]You're the one that has 21 hours in PictoPix.
[100:56.46]It's a fantastic little game.
[100:57.92]There's so many different versions.
[101:01.29]Jerma goes on dates and talks like an Oblivion NPC.
[101:04.02]No, I was just giving examples.
[101:06.74]Look, my brain is tired.
[101:08.54]So, they're going to be very, very basic, simple examples.
[101:13.23]Alright, we're almost done.
[101:17.05]Thank you to Garfield of Undicula for the $2.50.
[101:18.95]It's been a while since I've made a comic for you.
[101:21.55]Let's get this on here.
[101:22.37]Because we're almost done.
[101:26.07]Been a while since I made a comic for you, Jerm the Worm.
[101:27.77]I had a dream the mammoth from Ice Age was trying to kill me inside an insane asylum.
[101:32.14]First of all, don't eat before you go to bed, because that's why that happened.
[101:36.42]The only way out was to grab an egg spinning on a metal saw blade.
[101:39.34]Have you ever had a dream like that?
[101:43.10]Ever had deja vu before?
[101:45.48]Hey, I'm Garf.
[101:46.13]I'm not so Garf.
[101:47.07]And we're the Game Garfs, yeah.
[101:49.01]Jerm, you said that yesterday.
[101:50.43]You're losing your marbles, man.
[101:51.71]Oh, and he called the doctor.
[101:52.53]I don't think Jerm is feeling, uh...
[101:56.65]Stop.
[101:57.17]You violated the law.
[101:58.53]You burnt the chicken.
[101:59.71]I burnt the chicken.
[102:00.61]You burnt the chicken.
[102:04.53]God damn it.
[102:09.65]Yeah, don't eat like a fucking three slices of pepperoni pizza before you go to bed.
[102:12.95]That's why you're having weird dreams.
[102:14.33]I'm serious.
[102:14.87]Look it up.
[102:17.25]The f- Uh...
[102:25.35]I just did that.
[102:26.19]Don't!
[102:31.17]I'm gonna do that now?
[102:32.05]Why?
[102:34.15]No, don't.
[102:34.95]Eating right before bed fucks with you.
[102:36.75]It does, yes.
[102:38.95]Somebody just said it.
[102:43.18]But thank you, Garfield, for the 250.
[102:44.58]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer.
[102:46.92]Bingo Sunshine, thanks for the five bucks.
[102:49.18]The AI... The AL is a boring mess this year.
[102:55.27]Do you think the Brewers can win the most competitive division in baseball and take it all?
[102:58.73]Fuck the Pats.
[102:59.71]LOL.
[102:59.89]The Red Sox are going to win again.
[103:04.03]The Red Sox are going to win 154 games.
[103:12.91]Hey, Mast Herman, thanks for the $10.
[103:17.89]Thank you so much.
[103:21.19]I've been hoping to show you the movie I made inspired by Rat Movie.
[103:25.41]Oh, it's Masked Hero Man, not Masked Herman.
[103:29.63]Like the Pee-Wee Herman superhero, I'm sorry.
[103:36.82]It's... It's... There's no capitals on Streamlabs.
[103:41.44]I've tried to explain this before, but there are no capitals on Streamlabs.
[103:46.40]So, M, the H, and the M, they're not capitalized, so it's Masked Herman.
[103:54.59]I'm sorry.
[103:58.43]Yeah, by the way, why the fuck are there no capitals on Streamlabs?
[104:06.83]I have no idea why that is.
[104:07.89]It's why I botched so many names.
[104:14.49]That's so odd.
[104:15.17]I'm just thinking about this now, how odd that is.
[104:21.21]Mass tournament.
[104:22.90]But for real, thank you so much, HeroMan, for the 10 bucks.
[104:26.28]You made a rat movie.
[104:27.32]A movie inspired by a rat movie.
[104:30.95]When you got it done, give it a link.
[104:33.75]Why do I support Boston teams?
[104:37.07]I think it's this weird scenario where I grew up on the East Coast and grew up in Boston in like 30 years of my life.
[104:44.51]Something like that.
[104:45.30]I don't know.
[104:45.90]It's weird how you root for the team that's closest to you somehow.
[104:50.34]I don't know.
[104:51.14]It's weird.
[104:52.54]How that works.
[104:54.24]Vegas gets a baseball team.
[104:55.40]I'll be a Vegas baseball fan.
[105:00.11]And they win.
[105:03.24]What are you talking about?
[105:05.14]You're from Massachusetts, you spent 30 plus years in Massachusetts, and the Massachusetts-based teams win all the fucking time.
[105:14.53]Why are you a fan of the Boston area teams?
[105:20.17]Why wouldn't I be?
[105:27.98]You have to admit that Boston fans are the worst in the country.
[105:32.71]Why would I do that?
[105:34.79]Red Sox Nation.
[105:36.81]Red Sox Nation.
[105:39.17]Representing here.
[105:42.01]Duncan.
[105:42.87]Red Sox.
[105:43.71]Duncan.
[105:44.39]Red Sox.
[105:45.08]Duncan.
[105:45.76]Red Sox.
[105:55.56]I just had... That's pretty much five out of ten conversations you'll have in downtown Boston.
[106:01.45]Hey, hey, hey, Duncan?
[106:03.59]Yeah, yeah, it's a lodge.
[106:05.17]Red Sox.
[106:06.09]Yeah.
[106:09.03]Hey, Duncan?
[106:11.12]Duncan Sox?
[106:12.84]You got it.
[106:14.98]That's how fucking like deals are made over here.
[106:17.10]When they're building buildings in Boston, that's how they, that's what they do.
[106:19.56]Oops.
[106:24.09]Oh, yeah, I'm from out of town.
[106:25.75]I'm from Wisconsin.
[106:27.10]I'm here on a contract duty.
[106:29.40]I was just wondering how tall we're going to be making the floors here.
[106:33.92]I heard maybe 15 or 16 stories high.
[106:37.08]Which one is it?
[106:39.22]Sharks.
[106:42.36]17.
[106:42.78]Okay.
[106:44.19]Now, what about the... How many doors are we going to have?
[106:46.55]I heard we're going to have two doors, double doors on the front and then single doors on the back.
[106:52.63]Red Sharks Nation.
[106:54.76]Okay, so, we're gonna have two, uh, thank you for the clarification, two double doors in the front, and one in the back.
[107:04.08]That's how it works.
[107:11.58]Hey, Jack!
[107:14.27]Thank you, Jack, for the $250.
[107:15.63]What's your favorite game you played in 2019?
[107:16.81]Resident Evil 2.
[107:19.93]Probably.
[107:22.87]We're talking about games that released in 2019.
[107:24.35]Sekiro is definitely up there, but Resident Evil 2, probably.
[107:32.30]Probably.
[107:34.60]It'd be close because Sekiro was great.
[107:41.58]Hey, Havgon, thanks for the 250.
[107:43.09]Hey Jeremy, it was fun watching you play Sekiro, but I was disappointed that you didn't take the Japanese voices.
[107:48.23]A spin, I saw Criken play with the Japanese voices and it made the game feel like a Kurosawa film.
[107:53.05]Plus the Japanese voice actors have more consistent pronunciations of the names.
[107:56.99]My favorite boss fight to watch was Isshin.
[107:58.87]What was your favorite boss battle?
[108:00.89]The first fight with Genichiro or the fight with Owl.
[108:04.54]Probably my favorites.
[108:07.28]I was supposed to turn on the Japanese voice acting after the first, like, 40 minutes of the game.
[108:12.34]I'm just realizing this now.
[108:17.98]Whoops.
[108:27.95]This... Alright, it's alright.
[108:35.70]The owl fight was pretty boring looking.
[108:37.84]I just liked the flow of that fight.
[108:40.02]The horse guy was fun too.
[108:44.04]The Genichiro fight was the best, I think.
[108:47.53]That second phase was just so interesting for the first time seeing that.
[108:51.81]With the lightning.
[108:52.51]Like, he's the first person that you understand that with.
[108:56.99]You know?
[108:57.21]And it's a really interesting mechanic.
[109:01.19]Doesn't feel bad, it feels fun to do.
[109:05.31]But thank you, Hevgon.
[109:05.99]Thank you, Gondor Lane, for the 250.
[109:08.50]A few days ago, Jerma, I actually had a dream of you.
[109:10.80]More dreams about... Hopefully this is not about, like, people, like, putting you in, like, a torture room or something, like the other one was.
[109:16.66]In the dream, I was just browsing Twitch, and I just saw you streaming and saw that it said you were playing Sam & Max.
[109:22.21]I got so unbelievably excited.
[109:23.85]Then I woke up, and my heart sank.
[109:26.89]You were playing my favorite game.
[109:29.27]It's suggested often in the Discord, too.
[109:31.15]Make us happy, Jerma.
[109:32.05]It's a perfect wind-down puzzle game, although it's lengthy, so you might want to save it for a good weekend.
[109:40.45]Alright, I gotta, I gotta tell you.
[109:43.31]Every time somebody brings up Sam and Max, at least a handful of people, at least, go, don't do it.
[109:54.47]What's going on here?
[109:57.96]What's going on here?
[110:00.38]You just said, you, Gondor Lane just said don't do it.
[110:02.70]You just told me that you had a dream about me playing it.
[110:05.16]What do you, and you want, what?
[110:13.84]Why did you say don't do it?
[110:15.40]Don't you want me to do this?
[110:22.93]Yeah, it is on a list.
[110:24.57]It is just one of those games that's probably gonna be chill and just hang out.
[110:28.99]It was his nightmare.
[110:30.09]Ah, I see, right.
[110:32.97]But I can't give you any reason why it's gonna start or what it would happen or when.
[110:39.68]Just know that it is on a list
[110:42.82]It's on a notepad.
[110:44.02]It's just the stars need to align.
[110:49.52]For the love of God, don't do it.
[110:54.99]But thank you.
[110:55.39]I appreciate the enthusiasm and I appreciate the dream.
[110:59.83]I mean, you hated that dream.
[111:00.96]You got upset about that dream.
[111:04.14]I shouldn't be happy about that dream.
[111:06.92]But thank you.
[111:08.04]George McCaw, thanks for the 250.
[111:09.89]You're really good at these games, but it's still fun to make fun of you losing.
[111:13.29]I love everything you do, bud.
[111:16.15]Nice RP here, by the way.
[111:18.25]What?
[111:20.59]Nice RP?
[111:26.54]Hold on, I gotta get, like, PictoPix out of here.
[111:31.16]The PictoPix was playing over.
[111:33.42]Alright, this is nice RP.
[111:37.98]Let's see what they mean by this.
[111:49.53]My stomach, it cut me!
[111:52.57]Open!
[111:52.95]Fucking hell.
[112:05.32]Where is it?
[112:05.76]Where is it?
[112:06.12]Come on, say it.
[112:07.96]Say it.
[112:08.74]I didn't even... Here we go.
[112:10.24]I didn't even have the... Oh, he was gonna say it.
[112:12.98]He was gonna say it.
[112:13.78]He was gonna do it.
[112:19.22]You are so dramatic.
[112:24.48]He was gonna say... I wouldn't even ready or... I didn't even have the right thing equipped or... I should've... The hitbox was so big.
[112:34.45]You're gonna hear at least one of them.
[112:42.79]Fuck this guy.
[112:43.19]I'm gonna go watch Jerma at 8-5.
[112:45.41]There's dirt in my controller.
[112:46.47]Yeah, this is disgusting.
[112:47.37]It really is.
[112:48.33]Get a list of all the things I've said and how many times I've said them.
[112:51.23]It'd be embarrassing for me to see it.
[112:53.13]You want to, like, embarrass me on stream?
[112:58.20]Pick out all the times that I said something like that and count them.
[113:02.00]It would probably be the same audio clip like fucking 50 times and it would be an embarrassment.
[113:15.68]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the 250.
[113:16.72]This is the best Iron Chef icebreaker.
[113:19.76]It's called beer.
[113:20.68]But there is one more ingredient to this battle.
[113:23.50]Our secret ingredient.
[113:25.40]The theme on which our chefs... This guy likes those, like, flips and shit.
[113:29.50]Today's secret ingredient is... Beer!
[113:31.28]Beer!
[113:31.38]Beer!
[113:48.25]You gotta, okay, give, give him credit.
[113:50.63]To do a big elaborate like, This is the thing that I'm revealing!
[113:54.99]Right?
[113:56.57]Beer is one syllable.
[113:59.14]Beer!
[114:01.56]Beer!
[114:02.60]It's gotta be longer.
[114:04.94]Beer!
[114:05.78]That's how I would do it.
[114:06.50]I would go, Beer!
[114:09.88]Today's secret ingredient is... Beer!
[114:13.17]I do... You know the line.
[114:23.78]Uh, thank you, Mast Hero Man, for the ten dollars just a few minutes ago.
[114:26.52]Here's a link straight from Herman's mind.
[114:29.06]Herman's mind.
[114:32.92]What the hell is this?
[114:34.80]Oh, the... Bonjour.
[114:46.99]Are you there?
[114:47.35]What is it, Gringle?
[114:49.13]Bonjour.
[114:57.74]This is a 3D movie maker.
[115:03.23]I'm surprised people can even get this to run.
[115:10.99]This is a 21 minute video, holy shit.
[115:13.92]How long did this take you to make?
[115:21.34]I remember when I went through 3D Movie Maker... I would have to restart and do different clips and pull different segments because after like five minutes of actually in the editor, the thing would break down.
[115:46.50]You still need to stream yourself making Rat Movie 3.
[115:48.70]Oh, no, that would be... No, it would just take too long.
[115:51.83]It takes me so long to do that shit.
[115:53.95]I don't think anyone would want to really see that.
[116:07.04]But thank you, Masked Hero Man.
[116:14.38]It took four days.
[116:15.16]Did it all on stream?
[116:23.80]Well, that would be fucking... I can't imagine how crazy that would be.
[116:27.88]And do I have transparency of my planets?
[116:30.26]I don't.
[116:31.38]I really don't.
[116:34.43]It's just the emotes.
[116:35.75]It's the emotes that are just blown up.
[116:38.03]I don't have, like, high quality, uh, transparency of them.
[116:46.16]That would be your most popular stream.
[116:52.74]What a bad practice.
[116:54.46]But it's more authentic that way.
[116:59.03]When Ashley did the shirt, she actually, like, redrew it.
[117:04.05]And used the emotes, too, as references and tried to copy them and stuff.
[117:11.59]There was, like, a couple of different versions.
[117:16.76]She's very talented.
[117:17.70]Let's just put it that way.
[117:22.26]Let's get the credits up here.
[117:23.08]These are all the subs tonight.
[117:24.08]There were a lot of gifted subs.
[117:27.56]Thank you, everybody, for sticking around.
[117:30.22]We got two or three more bits to get through.
[117:34.48]Not much more.
[117:36.57]Let's see how fast this is going to go.
[117:38.73]Pretty fast.
[117:39.41]Pretty fast.
[117:46.90]Thank you so much, everybody.
[117:51.28]You will see me again.
[117:54.08]I'm going to take the next two days off.
[117:56.76]So I'll see you guys on the 31st.
[117:59.99]I'm going to do Monster Rancher 4.
[118:12.28]It's also, uh... It's Kim's birthday.
[118:15.65]Very soon here.
[118:16.83]So... We're gonna probably celebrate it.
[118:21.05]Over this, uh, weekend here.
[118:25.39]So happy birthday to Kim.
[118:27.69]Preemptively.
[118:31.64]So I'll see you guys on the 31st.
[118:34.38]And we'll figure out what we're gonna do from there.
[118:35.82]Monster Rancher 4 is the plan.
[118:37.62]We'll see if it's any good.
[118:40.56]But we're not done yet.
[118:42.73]Wild stuff, yeah.
[118:43.21]That is kind of... yeah, that's crazy.
[119:09.13]He eats this food, too.
[119:11.71]In Kitchen Nightmares, he'll just sit there at the beginning and be like, oh, like, yeah, give me the crab cakes, and he'll eat them.
[119:17.68]Even if he knows that the place is about to shut down because it's disgusting.
[119:24.72]Didn't he quit Kitchen Nightmares because he kept getting sick from the food?
[119:28.20]That would be crazy if that was true.
[119:30.30]I don't know.
[119:30.86]If that's true, that's ridiculous.
[119:37.64]But thank you for the $2.50, Jess.
[119:39.54]Garfield the Monday Killer coming in right here.
[119:41.33]$2.50?
[119:42.85]Jerma, what do you think you're doing, man?
[119:44.19]You skipped my comic.
[119:45.83]You know how much time I spent in the writing room developing this?
[119:48.51]Don't you remember my links don't stink?
[119:52.01]When has Garf ever led you astray?
[119:54.34]Now read the comic or I'm unsubbing.
[119:55.90]Can you even unsub on Twitch?
[119:57.36]I don't know.
[119:59.98]Let's take a look.
[120:04.56]Hey Jerma, if I were to die today, how would you feel?
[120:09.24]He's dead.
[120:09.64]We finally killed him.
[120:10.52]I can live in peace.
[120:11.36]Reality is often disappointing.
[120:12.78]That was it.
[120:14.44]Can't get rid of me that easy.
[120:15.58]That emote is so bad.
[120:19.42]Do you see what that looks like up close?
[120:30.79]Can I at least change the name of this emote?
[120:34.83]Why did you guys vote for Mustard?
[120:36.37]No, it doesn't make any sense at all.
[120:38.43]Not even a remote smidge of sense.
[120:50.22]You guys voted for this name.
[120:52.52]People come in here and they think that I made this emote called Dermamustard and they're like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[120:58.21]Some weird meta inside joke?
[121:01.15]No, chat had 10 or 15 different options.
[121:11.55]Jeremy, why?
[121:13.53]But thank you, Garfield, for your comic.
[121:17.28]Thank you.
[121:20.34]We'll let you change it if you can beat a Picross level in under five minutes.
[121:23.34]No.
[121:25.32]I'm done with embarrassing myself.
[121:27.85]At least for one night.
[121:30.54]VRJosh right at the end, thank you for the 250.
[121:32.50]Hey Jerma, for one of your future VR streams, I'd highly suggest looking into a free program called Live.
[121:38.13]It's free and on Steam.
[121:40.43]It lets you composite yourself into the VR games really easily and looks awesome.
[121:44.65]Works best with a green screen, but they also have tools to composite out other backgrounds too.
[121:50.65]I've actually seen this.
[121:55.05]Yeah, I have seen this before.
[122:02.17]You just... I feel like I would want to pick a room for this, though.
[122:05.31]Unfortunately, this room is not big enough for this to work.
[122:11.76]Because I just have barely enough room for you guys to even have a face cam pointing at me and for me to do a room skill.
[122:18.86]This is really, really cool, though.
[122:27.08]Don't you mean your office?
[122:28.42]Yeah, well, every time I say that word... It triggers this automatic response.
[122:35.28]And I look over and see L-U-Ls.
[122:39.84]You guys have like a script ready when I say the word office.
[122:49.50]Rent the green screen and bring the VR.
[122:53.06]No, if I'm gonna go to the green screen...
[122:56.57]That I'm gonna do, like, the vape Fortnite joke.
[122:59.47]And if those of you that don't know what I'm talking about, then good.
[123:01.55]Because I still might do it.
[123:06.86]Where the room just fills with, like, fucking fog.
[123:10.84]And I'm dressed like a dick.
[123:15.96]I love this, okay?
[123:18.31]Even if it's gonna fall flat on my face, I still want to do it.
[123:27.44]No, not like an actual dick, just dressed like a dick.
[123:30.21]Dressed like a dickhead.
[123:37.93]But that's gonna be it.
[123:39.17]I'll see you guys in... Let's see... Friday, Saturday, I'll see you guys on Sunday.
[123:46.38]Sunday through the 1st.
[123:47.82]Same time, same place, around 3-4pm Pacific.
[123:52.14]Sekiro is done.
[123:54.92]Thank you for joining me for the...
[123:58.03]One of the best games probably that's come out in 2019.
[124:02.19]Hard as shit.
[124:03.51]Frustrating as hell.
[124:05.05]But it was great.
[124:07.81]Hope you enjoyed it.

[124:25.81]Oh, right, right, right, right, hold on.
[124:27.57]The guild, the guild members.
[124:29.69]Keep, always remind me about this, because I know a lot of people think it's fun.
[124:36.91]It's a free loot.
[124:44.47]If you scroll all the way to the bottom of a page, there's like a little idle game.
[124:46.88]It's called Stream Legends.
[124:52.73]Just a little fun, free little idle game.
[124:56.01]And I can give loot every so often, so... Let's do it.
[124:59.95]Alright, you ready?
[125:09.52]Here it comes.
[125:10.26]Three, two, one.
[125:12.63]Bingo.
[125:14.61]Enjoy the free shit.
[125:17.87]Alright guys, take care.
[125:19.19]See you soon.
