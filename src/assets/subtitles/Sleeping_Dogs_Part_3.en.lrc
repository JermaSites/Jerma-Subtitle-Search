[00:14.59]You know the intro, you've heard it a million times.
[00:16.01]Hey, what's going on everybody?
[00:17.03]Hey, by the way, Skittles, taste that rainbow.
[00:44.14]How many of you guys got Skittles commercials?
[00:45.88]I got one.
[00:47.32]Fucking advertisements.
[00:48.26]They think they can control us?
[00:50.08]They think they can control me?
[00:52.40]With your subliminal bullshit?
[01:28.22]It's a precedence that we take action on that.
[01:31.50]You know what I'm saying?
[01:33.40]And I think... $25?
[01:41.11]That's too much money.
[01:42.73]That is way too much for anyone to ever... What?
[01:52.21]My mic's fucked up?
[01:53.41]Hold on.
[01:56.27]Give me a second.
[01:58.01]I need to re-plug it in.
[02:04.35]Hey!
[02:04.76]I don't know.
[02:06.54]I'm fucking... I don't know what's wrong with me tonight.
[02:07.94]Hey!
[02:08.08]I'm gonna play more Sleeping Dogs.
[02:09.66]You all know.
[02:10.14]You already know what it is.
[02:13.72]See you in a second.
[02:16.36]Turn off that intro.
[02:17.28]We don't even need an intro.
[02:18.14]You already know what we're doing.
[02:21.91]Nice joke.
[02:24.53]What, you guys don't like the Jim Carrey close the slider while you're yelling?
[02:28.77]And when the slider is closed, you can't hear the yelling anymore?
[02:33.52]From Ace Ventura?
[02:35.88]Explain the ant thing.
[02:37.08]No.
[02:38.44]That's a, you had to be there.
[02:40.64]That's a you had to be there kind of moment.
[02:43.18]I can't pull that back.
[02:44.46]Alright, let's go.
[02:48.94]Pick it off right where you left off.
[02:51.53]Sleeping dogs.
[02:52.31]We're on the DLC island.
[02:53.71]I think.
[02:55.61]Uh, no.
[03:00.72]Apparently not.
[03:02.38]I guess we are not on the island anymore.
[03:06.74]Well.
[03:11.98]Okay.
[03:13.04]So this is what we're doing now, I guess.
[03:17.70]Banned for ants.
[03:19.10]I can't even see the chat.
[03:21.08]God damn it.
[03:22.90]That's it.
[03:24.30]Streams over.
[03:28.01]Hey, there we are.
[03:29.81]Back to the story.
[03:30.77]There is no story.
[03:31.55]I don't know why everyone thinks I... When we're talking in chat and we're going over anything we're going over or having a discussion or something, I can't explain the discussion.
[03:42.95]I'd have to give you context.
[03:45.01]English is a contextual language like we talked about.
[03:49.37]I want a different outfit.
[03:53.43]Grubby.
[03:54.31]Workout clothes.
[03:57.56]We were doing this.
[04:00.76]I've not seen the Avengers.
[04:03.28]And I heard it was really bad.
[04:05.56]So I'm not sure I'm going to see it.
[04:06.56]It's got like a 12% on Rotten Tomatoes.
[04:10.48]I don't know if I'm, uh, if I'm into that.
[04:13.74]I guess it's like, I guess, um, it's being compared to, uh, like, Suicide Squad for being, like, just awful, so.
[04:24.54]Of course I'm gonna see it!
[04:26.77]High roller.
[04:29.59]Did the Yakuza outfit?
[04:30.77]No.
[04:33.57]No, I've heard, I've heard it was really good.
[04:35.73]I've heard it was good enough.
[04:38.61]Remember this joke?
[04:41.71]I do.
[04:44.21]Well, he came out at the same time.
[04:45.72]Don't, I'm not gonna, don't, no, that's not what we're doing.
[04:48.14]Let's do some missions, man.
[04:49.78]I love this game.
[04:50.94]Have you played, did anyone tell you that yet?
[04:52.52]That I love this game?
[04:57.94]There's consequences, you see?
[04:59.12]You know, there's real consequences here.
[05:02.68]I've been coming here for 30 years, Lawrence.
[05:05.66]Mistakes need to be real.
[05:08.60]You understand, Lawrence?
[05:14.87]Uh, this is the Sazh, the same guy.
[05:26.75]We're gonna go to... Let's do this.
[05:30.02]Let's go meet Ace.
[05:30.74]No, that's Ed Harris from Westworld.
[05:35.20]Come on, man.
[05:40.30]You're exactly the same, Lawrence.
[05:43.06]Come on!
[06:01.66]Calling my cellular telephone device.
[06:06.78]I'll never get that.
[06:07.54]I'll never get it right.
[06:13.07]Find Ace.
[06:13.97]Call from Ace.
[06:16.57]Oh.
[06:17.03]There he is.
[06:19.83]I gotta trace the- Whoa, hold on a minute.
[06:21.87]Get the ants to the center of the ants.
[06:23.94]Get to the center of the ants.
[06:32.38]Oh, okay, this way.
[06:33.14]Oh, I gotta get to the center of the maze.
[06:41.97]You're gonna help me find out what this game's all about.
[06:45.17]I'm gonna get to the center of the maze.
[06:48.37]Give me a fucking hundred dollars for that one.
[06:54.98]I'm in one of those moods tonight, guys.
[06:56.42]I don't know why.
[07:02.04]I'm not going the right way.
[07:02.86]I should probably get in the car.
[07:10.65]Maybe not.
[07:11.47]It's right here.
[07:13.03]Up here?
[07:16.81]Oh, you can make it up there, man.
[07:21.62]What happened to the Zodiac tourney?
[07:22.98]I have the sway in question.
[07:28.19]That's the last what we left off.
[07:29.95]Anytime you reload the game, I think it just puts you in the center of the maze.
[07:37.55]There he is.
[07:40.15]This guy?
[07:40.61]Do I have to put a marker on this dude?
[07:44.53]No, up here.
[07:45.33]Okay, I guess it's over there.
[07:54.68]Just get in here.
[08:11.24]400 meters?
[08:13.06]How would that not be the center here?
[08:17.49]There we go, okay Right here?
[08:26.39]Oh Jesus, okay now I understand It's this way now Oh this sucks
[08:40.09]I thought it was going to be much closer than this.
[08:43.26]No, no, no, no, no.
[08:44.52]I'm going to have to turn around.
[08:45.88]Actually, this is not that bad.
[08:53.92]This way.
[08:57.60]Bang.
[08:57.96]I'm going to bang a left over here.
[09:01.26]Why do I have to do this to get... Why do I have to do this?
[09:05.44]I can't just call the police?
[09:06.62]Alright, there we go.
[09:08.60]I'm almost there.
[09:10.56]I think I can wrap around this way.
[09:12.26]Just have to go over there.
[09:16.74]Alright, let's go.
[09:19.22]Someone stop him.
[09:20.16]What do you mean, somebody stop me?
[09:22.52]Why do I need to be stopped?
[09:28.15]Streamer says he understands the game.
[09:32.09]Yeah, I am the police.
[09:35.95]I don't have a contact that can do this?
[09:41.13]There we go.
[09:41.45]Alright.
[09:42.79]Trace the call.
[09:46.63]Scan the region with the strongest signal.
[09:51.39]What's this one?
[09:54.18]Find the common... I didn't get... Okay, I'm gonna get hurt.
[10:04.36]Find the one common to all antennas.
[10:06.94]Okay?
[10:11.72]Wait a minute, okay.
[10:17.06]Scanning failed.
[10:18.32]Connections locked.
[10:19.30]What the fuck am I supposed to be doing?
[10:22.11]What the hell was that?
[10:39.27]What was that?
[10:40.53]What the fuck was that?
[10:42.63]Find the one common thing to connect the- What are you- What are you people- What?
[10:47.67]Oh my fucking god.
[10:48.77]I hate this mission.
[10:55.62]Scan the green people.
[11:10.42]Speed it up.
[11:12.14]Get out of the way.
[11:18.04]Take a left down here.
[11:19.76]And then scan the humans again.
[11:22.04]Okay, let's try this again.
[11:31.41]Scan the region with the strongest signal, which is this one here.
[11:35.83]And then now I have to... Find the one common...
[11:40.89]green to all antennas.
[11:49.75]Let me see.
[11:51.13]How long they beep?
[11:53.04]Okay, no, I understand.
[11:59.08]Okay.
[11:59.34]I think it's the one on the left.
[12:00.30]I think it's this one here.
[12:01.30]What's this one?
[12:02.88]Yeah, okay.
[12:03.64]I just didn't know what the fuck he was even trying to tell me to do.
[12:10.42]Get to the crash before Ace's girlfriend dies.
[12:22.19]Quickly, before she dies.
[12:24.09]Hurry up before she dies!
[12:25.15]That's her health meter.
[12:31.61]Hurry up, she doesn't have any Estus's left!
[12:38.65]That was fucking funny, dude.
[12:42.38]Nice, man.
[12:43.98]You got any more?
[12:45.94]Yeah, maybe sometime.
[12:47.38]Stay tuned, man.
[12:47.96]Oh, I'm so excited.
[12:52.10]I know, me too.
[12:55.67]She's down there.
[12:56.39]She's down.
[12:56.61]I'm going to have to jump out.
[12:58.09]No, she's not.
[12:58.49]Where is she?
[12:59.89]Right here.
[13:05.94]Investigate the crash.
[13:07.30]What crash?
[13:07.82]There's a crash down here?
[13:19.19]Found her!
[13:19.85]There we go.
[13:20.33]Okay, I'm gonna get you to safety.
[13:28.25]Actually insane, streamer.
[13:32.30]Tell me everything you know.
[13:47.47]Well, that sounds so terrible, but you know, I do that shit like ten times a minute, and I'm fine.
[13:55.71]You're acting- that's a totally normal occurrence in my world, lady.
[14:01.00]Should I pick her up?
[14:04.84]Why wouldn't I try to help this lady?
[14:08.48]I'm just going to leave her.
[14:13.50]Okay.
[14:13.80]I forgot about that.
[14:14.84]See?
[14:16.10]Lady, what are you describing?
[14:17.54]Can I get you to look over here to the left?
[14:20.10]Is this what you're describing?
[14:21.48]Hmm.
[14:24.40]There we are, ma'am.
[14:25.60]I've solved the case.
[14:26.38]I do that shit on a daily basis.
[14:36.20]Got it.
[14:43.58]Um, so why?
[14:46.14]Why wouldn't I help her?
[14:47.20]Ah, yeah, an eyewitness that's dying on the beach.
[14:51.35]Somebody's getting in an accident up there.
[15:14.14]This is just maniacal.
[15:15.64]I'm kind of concerned about this.
[15:42.03]I don't think I can do anything for her, though.
[15:44.21]Find a fast car!
[15:46.53]Hey, I found one!
[15:47.91]I found a fast car!
[15:53.06]How do I get in it?
[15:54.28]How do I get in the fast car?
[15:56.06]That's the one problem.
[16:01.52]Well, I'm gonna leave her.
[16:03.48]Can't really help her.
[16:04.12]Ooh, another fast car.
[16:10.77]Nah, this ain't a fast car.
[16:12.54]Dump it.
[16:26.30]Alright, you have to be... You have to understand what I'm trying to do here.
[16:31.54]Do you get it?
[16:32.54]Do you guys get it yet?
[16:33.38]I'm trying to drive over the railing to land the car on the lady.
[16:38.58]But, I feel like that's going to end the mission, so maybe I shouldn't do that.
[16:41.70]Fast car.
[16:50.53]Oh, Jermo, we don't understand.
[16:51.93]This one's got electrical sounds.
[16:56.33]This is going to cash back?
[16:58.89]Fast cash back?
[17:01.88]I like it.
[17:02.24]I'm going to use it.
[17:03.86]Don't get it all fucking dirty.
[17:09.63]Get it all dirty.
[17:11.65]Whoa, this is fast.
[17:19.93]Whoa.
[17:24.13]Fine.
[17:28.47]That little ding never hurt anybody.
[17:34.81]Couple of dings and dents.
[17:39.01]It's a refurbished model anyways.
[17:42.65]Yeah!
[17:43.69]Whatever.
[17:44.01]It doesn't matter.
[17:44.71]The car just has to drive.
[17:45.61]It's okay.
[17:46.29]I'm going to go to a cutscene.
[17:48.19]And the car is going to get repaired.
[17:49.91]I promise.
[17:50.37]You want to bet $100,000 on that?
[17:52.69]US?
[17:52.79]USD?
[17:52.89]I will bet $100,000.
[17:53.17]United States dollars.
[17:54.06]That when we go in the cutscene.
[17:55.52]The car is magically repaired.
[18:08.95]If the car... Remember, this is a $100,000 bet.
[18:14.80]To be deposited directly into my account.
[18:17.74]So, I will go to a bank, and I will take out $100,000.
[18:19.66]And I will put that into my other bank account.
[18:24.62]I'm going to have to get a loan, though.
[18:25.95]Because I don't have $100,000.
[18:26.93]So, I'm going to get a loan for $100,000.
[18:29.17]I'm going to lie to them.
[18:30.23]I'm going to make up a business.
[18:32.01]We'll call it, like, Fastback.
[18:33.35]Like, Cashback.
[18:34.03]Okay.
[18:34.96]It's a service where I loan people money.
[18:37.71]So, I'll go get a loan to start my own loan business.
[18:40.91]And pay myself with that.
[18:42.59]Well... I owe myself $100,000 in loans.
[18:54.76]Hahaha.
[19:02.60]Don't disable Hotshot's car until you hit the roadblock.
[19:08.76]There's too many- this is very- this is- okay, this is a drift level.
[19:13.78]Look at how many turns there are with really fast cars.
[19:20.77]Am I supposed to beat him or am I just supposed to play with him for a little bit?
[19:29.91]Oh my god.
[19:31.63]This is on expert level.
[19:33.47]I didn't play these Mario Kart levels, you know what I'm saying?
[19:36.67]These are the ones that were too hard for me.
[19:43.46]Give me a Mario Circuit all day.
[19:51.98]He's going all kinds of fucking weird directions.
[19:57.66]I don't know, I don't know.
[19:58.68]Can't even see him.
[19:59.30]He's leaving me in the dust.
[20:04.91]God damn it!
[20:05.73]I'm trying to drift around like a fucking idiot.
[20:08.71]God damn it!
[20:09.45]I haven't did like the Yoshi story shortcut thing and it didn't even matter.
[20:21.73]Alright, catching up.
[20:27.77]Big turn here.
[20:29.53]Can't blow this.
[20:33.68]Alright, there we go.
[20:34.50]Better.
[20:36.70]Better.
[20:37.46]Good.
[20:48.23]What am I supposed to do?
[20:49.27]Are we going to do this for him?
[20:50.67]There we go.
[20:51.03]Whoa!
[20:51.13]I thought this was supposed to be a race!
[20:55.27]That guy just came out of the...
[21:00.54]Is he disabled yet?
[21:02.98]That was bullshit.
[21:07.81]Jermis Fastback.
[21:10.59]You give me $100,000 and I give you $90,000 back in loans to the next person that comes in my office.
[21:21.10]And I promise you 10% dividends.
[21:26.58]He's still alive?
[21:36.19]Die!
[21:37.09]Wait, why do I have to escape the cops?
[21:40.95]I'm one of you!
[21:43.05]I'm one of the cops.
[21:49.25]Jerma's fast back super triangle!
[21:53.94]It's not a pyramid, stupid.
[21:55.26]It's a triangle.
[21:57.16]They're different.
[22:00.52]One of them's 3D.
[22:13.98]Congratulations.
[22:16.78]Now I have to hack his telephone again.
[22:20.63]Don't text and drive!
[22:24.02]Obstructing the view?
[22:25.06]Oh my god.
[22:26.06]Okay, here we go.
[22:26.76]Good work.
[22:27.36]High roller.
[22:27.78]2-0-0.
[22:27.88]Scoundrel file and a CIA report.
[22:30.42]And $1200.
[22:30.62]So now we got...
[22:51.57]Mr. Chew's Revenge.
[22:52.89]Mrs. Chew's Revenge.
[22:53.93]Don't meet the boss.
[22:56.53]By the way, that is the island.
[22:58.27]So, we're still... Let's do Mrs. Chew's Revenge.
[23:05.43]I want a bike.
[23:06.70]That car just DDT'd that guy into this mat car.
[23:20.63]I didn't have nothing to do with that.
[23:26.49]Excuse me, excuse me!
[23:31.51]This bike sucks.
[23:41.16]He's got the better bike.
[23:44.66]Where is he?
[23:46.18]He's right there, okay.
[23:48.38]Showed up randomly.
[23:50.95]Alright.
[23:52.47]Let's test it out, man.
[23:54.69]Let's race.
[23:57.79]Word around the street is you're the best fucking fastest valet in the world.
[24:03.91]Can you keep up with me?
[24:15.72]Word on the street is you're the fastest VA in the world.
[24:19.65]Hey, no, not a veterinary, not a veterinary, I think.
[24:32.09]Fuck.
[24:32.67]Hey, thanks a lot, buddy.
[24:35.05]You're a big help.
[24:46.64]Voice actor.
[24:49.52]Thanks, man.
[24:56.46]Have a good one.
[25:13.57]Wrong way.
[25:14.69]Right way.
[25:26.50]Almost there.
[25:34.51]Hey, yo.
[25:41.59]Wrong corner.
[25:45.11]Bingo.
[25:47.55]Do a funny thing on the motorcycle.
[26:09.50]Mrs. Chu.
[26:10.08]Those apples look really fresh.
[26:12.00]I want one.
[26:13.42]I was just stopping by to see if there was anything you needed.
[26:20.42]I know it's no consolation.
[26:21.76]Beyond fruits.
[26:22.70]But I got a look at one of the gunmen from the wedding.
[26:25.80]Now I will find him.
[26:27.88]And I'll make him tell me who's responsible.
[26:32.16]I'm sorry.
[26:34.91]Alright, I'll try.
[26:44.94]Welcome to Iron Man.
[26:52.85]We changed clothes.
[26:58.79]Call Ricky to get a Johnny number.
[27:03.34]No spoilers, no spoilers.
[27:04.04]No, God, is this the spoiler you didn't want me to see?
[27:31.29]that I had to do another one of these Find the Blip missions.
[27:35.56]At least this one's easy.
[27:46.56]This one's at least tolerable.
[27:50.41]He's in the middle of Sad Troll Park.
[28:01.11]Scan the region.
[28:02.53]Find one blip that is the same blip.
[28:04.79]There you go.
[28:05.51]Scan it.
[28:05.99]Go find Johnny Ratface.
[28:29.17]Alright, now if this character is an actual rat man.
[28:33.01]Get an A plus game.
[28:39.98]Tight.
[28:40.24]Okay, I was hitting left.
[28:43.88]Why would it turn me right?
[28:45.84]And what is going on with my video game?
[28:50.99]Innocent killed.
[28:51.61]I didn't touch that lady.
[28:54.75]How did I kill the lady?
[28:58.36]Did the air from the bike going by kill them?
[29:01.64]Didn't even touch them.
[29:03.34]That'll hold up.
[29:07.90]Do I know how a brake works?
[29:10.98]Yes, I've driven a car for about 20... I've had a license for 20 years.
[29:15.73]I think I know how a brake works.
[29:17.03]What do you think, I am crazy?
[29:19.61]I drive my car every day.
[29:21.49]It's a nice car, by the way.
[29:22.89]It's a Toyota Supercharger.
[29:27.61]12 year old driver.
[29:29.65]I got my permit early.
[29:31.13]Fine, Johnny the rat face.
[29:33.33]I would assume he's probably in here.
[29:35.78]There's a statue there though.
[29:36.88]There's gonna be a shootout or something.
[29:59.00]I knew it.
[29:59.82]You know, I knew it.
[30:02.74]I knew what was gonna happen here.
[30:04.14]Aw, I was in the middle of a combo.
[30:11.49]How could you do such a thing?
[30:14.63]Oh my god, I'm gonna put that guy through this.
[30:16.53]Is that a guillotine?
[30:17.93]Yes, it is.
[30:20.33]Awww.
[30:22.33]Guillotine.
[30:23.47]Come here.
[30:25.37]Holy shit, that was insane.
[30:38.37]Find him he's in here somewhere I'm gonna fight these guys too.
[30:44.27]Okay, I can probably sneak into these into this place Three more health shrines
[31:01.94]This is too violent.
[31:04.27]It is rated T for teenagers.
[31:07.59]And I'll show you why.
[31:08.43]Check this out.
[31:09.11]This is why it's rated T for teens.
[31:12.29]Not that, this.
[31:17.65]Yeah, that.
[31:19.05]T for teen, guys.
[31:20.29]And you know what?
[31:21.19]The game would be rated T for teen.
[31:23.47]If that's all that was happening.
[31:30.72]I'll take a knife.
[31:33.46]Thank you.
[31:43.51]I wish I could just have melee weapons.
[31:44.83]I want to buy them.
[31:48.17]Confront Johnny.
[31:54.22]If I confront you, you mean Michael Myers?
[31:57.40]From Michael Myers 3?
[31:58.20]When he throws the thing like a goddamn dagger?
[32:01.62]Oh, and he misses, and instead the music starts to play really loudly.
[32:08.06]And he gets on top of the guy and fucking starts stomping on his penis.
[32:13.17]Oh, I need a gun.
[32:17.71]Yeah, I know.
[32:18.61]Hide.
[32:25.50]By the way, what a stupid name for a movie.
[32:28.81]Have you guys realized that old horror movies, like all the old iconic movies, like first of all, they're not even... They're not even named anything.
[32:37.17]They're named after holidays.
[32:38.97]Or days.
[32:41.22]Think about that.
[32:43.38]So, you got Friday the 13th is just a date.
[32:46.06]That's the Jason movies.
[32:48.52]Halloween... That's just another day, that's another holiday.
[32:52.61]That's the Michael Myers movies.
[32:58.26]How many monster movies are just named after days?
[33:05.28]Saw.
[33:06.80]Named after, of course, Saturday and Wednesday.
[33:09.90]Every Saw movie takes place on Saturday and Wednesday.
[33:13.79]It's the jigsaw puzzle killer.
[33:15.73]I don't understand it.
[33:18.93]Ow.
[33:20.75]Is there an explosive?
[33:22.73]That's not an explosive.
[33:35.81]Texas Chainsaw, was it?
[33:37.01]Well, that's a state.
[33:39.01]So, you know, it's a days and states.
[33:42.45]Days and states and places.
[33:46.63]Nightmare on Elm Street.
[33:48.80]Freddy Krueger.
[33:51.40]What is Elm Street?
[33:52.94]Texas.
[33:54.54]Wednesday.
[33:56.40]Friday.
[33:56.86]Halloween.
[33:59.24]Halloween.
[34:13.70]Get him.
[34:18.94]Oh wow, we're still going here.
[34:22.72]And somehow... I didn't... Somehow... Don't die!
[34:28.58]There's one more guy.
[34:29.90]Where is he?
[34:31.84]Don't hurt Johnny.
[34:35.24]Cabin in the woods.
[34:38.76]Not anything that's going on in that movie.
[34:41.06]Where are we?
[34:42.04]Or what day is it?
[34:45.30]You can pull that back to every single horror movie.
[34:47.60]What day is it?
[34:48.65]Or where are we?
[34:52.89]The raft.
[34:54.03]Where are we?
[34:56.29]I'm gonna die.
[35:06.46]Why even have a title?
[35:16.90]Infinity War?
[35:18.06]Infinity War is not the same.
[35:19.54]That's like the name of the war that they're having.
[35:21.84]That's relevant.
[35:27.13]Killer clowns from outer space.
[35:29.03]Yeah.
[35:29.47]Where are they from?
[35:39.09]I saw a great movie that I saw recently.
[35:41.34]Get out.
[35:42.50]Where?
[35:43.80]Get out from here.
[35:44.98]Like, get out of here.
[35:45.78]Okay.
[35:46.87]It's a place to get out from there.
[35:50.51]Uh, what's another one?
[35:54.09]That's all I've seen recently.
[35:55.52]Oh, what's that?
[35:56.02]A quiet place.
[35:57.24]Hmm.
[35:58.82]Okay.
[35:59.82]What?
[36:00.08]A quiet place.
[36:01.08]A quiet place.
[36:02.00]They didn't even try with that one.
[36:08.60]What am I?
[36:08.92]I'm supposed to be shooting these guys.
[36:14.38]Probably should start doing that.
[36:18.58]Don't crash into a truck!
[36:22.93]I still have to see that one.
[36:30.07]Excuse me!
[36:36.35]Thank you!
[36:36.75]Darn it.
[36:44.46]That's not a real movie though.
[36:47.92]That's a pretend movie.
[36:49.22]Alright, I gotta get off this damn highway.
[37:14.92]It wasn't the wrong way.
[37:15.60]The GPS just has to update.
[37:17.42]I was going that way and the GPS turned me around and we saw last stream that we just have to go one direction.
[37:27.27]It's like, one direction?
[37:28.41]Which way are you facing?
[37:29.41]You know what I mean?
[37:30.17]Like, give me a fucking break.
[37:31.49]They need to stop that.
[37:41.42]98 degrees.
[37:42.28]How hot is it outside?
[37:43.45]Like, give me a fucking break.
[37:44.71]These horror movies cannot title correctly.
[38:00.25]Ocean's Eleven.
[38:01.17]That's not a horror movie.
[38:02.99]And neither are the last two things that I've said.
[38:05.51]And my points still stand.
[38:13.76]Uh-oh.
[38:14.22]She's not happy.
[38:17.72]What would I name them instead?
[38:19.18]Well, Friday the 13th would be Jason the Psycho.
[38:38.70]Nightmare on Elm Street would be... Kroger in Your Dreams.
[38:43.52]Kroger in Your Dreams 2.
[38:45.82]Kroger in Your Dreams 3.
[38:47.48]Kroger's Nightmare.
[38:49.14]Holy shit, she's murdering this guy.
[39:00.82]You know, like... You know, a nightmare on the streets?
[39:05.82]Kroger in the sheets.
[39:13.07]That wasn't very relevant.
[39:29.38]Get off that bike!
[39:30.88]Well that was... I stole that for no reason.
[39:40.28]Shut the fuck up, Jackie!
[39:41.69]We gotta think!
[39:42.65]You gotta think?
[39:43.73]Hey, calm down!
[39:44.67]Hey, calm down!
[39:46.95]Shut up, both of you!
[39:48.96]Winston's gone.
[39:50.46]Right now, we gotta stick together.
[39:52.56]We just can't let the 18k get away with this.
[39:54.54]What makes you so sure it was 18k?
[39:56.34]We all saw them.
[39:57.68]They were definitely 18k.
[39:59.28]Even stupid Jackie knows that.
[40:00.72]You ever think maybe they were just trying to look like 18k?
[40:02.54]Tell the silly putty story?
[40:04.09]What the fuck are you talking about?
[40:05.09]I had a few skirmishes with them lately, but nothing major.
[40:07.59]It doesn't make sense that they would do something this big.
[40:09.37]What silly putty story?
[40:10.63]Where are you getting that from?
[40:11.59]What do you think it was?
[40:12.65]I don't know, but I'm gonna find out.
[40:16.45]And who the fuck are you?
[40:18.29]I'm here for Mr. Lee.
[40:20.25]I take it you've heard of Big Smile Lee?
[40:22.61]He's another son on ye boss, redpolled just like Winston.
[40:25.91]Okay, what can we do for Mr. Lee?
[40:27.94]He has decided that for the time being, you may continue your operations in this area.
[40:33.60]But the percentage previously paid to Winston will now go to Mr. Lee.
[40:38.04]No, no, no, really, but what is this?
[40:39.77]What is this silly putty story?
[40:41.27]You got me.
[40:41.65]I'm all fucked up now.
[40:42.27]That's an interesting proposition.
[40:44.79]But I have a counteroffer for Mr. Lee.
[40:47.44]I'd appreciate if you relay this back to him, word for word.
[40:50.48]Can you do that?
[40:51.62]Shoot him.
[40:52.32]You tell Mr. Lee... So you tell him, bang, and then ow.
[40:55.76]And then return.
[40:56.78]And then... That's the blood coming out.
[40:59.62]I don't think you'll find that offer to his liking.
[41:02.27]I think you'll find that I don't give a fuck.
[41:04.55]You see our guest out, make sure he doesn't get lost.
[41:08.31]You'll regret this.
[41:10.05]I promise you that.
[41:15.73]That is a very comically large weapon, you're right.
[41:19.67]Get to your crew.
[41:21.29]First of all, give me the case.
[41:22.39]Oh, shit.
[41:25.62]Hold on, just pulled the door.
[41:27.98]And I mean that in a non-hilarious way, you know what I mean?
[41:31.88]God damn it, the analog is so slippery.
[41:52.65]Yeah, I mean, not in the hilarious way.
[41:58.01]I mean, it is hilarious.
[42:02.23]Alright, let's go.
[42:03.99]I got a watch?
[42:04.83]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[42:08.91]I got a... I got the big golden gun.
[42:15.10]It is a one-hit kill.
[42:16.74]No, it's not.
[42:19.68]Did I just stab him with the gun?
[42:23.05]I think I did.
[42:23.59]No, I just dropped my gun.
[42:30.90]Give me the other gun.
[42:31.60]Give me the cool one.
[42:32.90]Oh, god damn it.
[42:33.62]I dropped it.
[42:34.02]It's gone.
[42:35.50]I dropped it on the ground and the paint came off.
[42:46.21]Hey!
[42:55.37]Yeah, it's not there anymore.
[42:57.75]That's unfortunate.
[42:58.67]It just gave me ammo.
[43:00.65]Well, sorry about your gun, man.
[43:02.31]I know you probably spent a lot of time and a lot of money on it.
[43:17.82]I think I'm finally going to get to go in the crow's nest.
[43:20.64]Right?
[43:22.68]What if I just try to dance in here?
[43:29.28]Come on.
[43:29.54]I need to get in there.
[43:30.74]Come on.
[43:33.66]Come on!
[43:35.10]Come on, let me get up there.
[43:37.69]I've wanted this the whole game.
[43:40.23]Oh, shit!
[43:40.79]Alright, you want to Looney Tunes this?
[43:45.59]Come over here.
[43:47.07]Who threw the chair at him?
[43:50.63]Come on, please Looney Tunes this with me.
[43:52.97]Alright, here we go.
[43:54.87]No!
[43:54.93]You're supposed to Looney Tunes this!
[43:57.43]Get down!
[43:59.45]We have to Yosemite Sam versus Bugs Bunny.
[44:01.41]Come on, man.
[44:02.39]Don't do this to me.
[44:08.07]Thanks a lot, buddy.
[44:09.05]Appreciate it.
[44:13.05]Where's the assault rifle?
[44:15.43]Okay, let's go.
[44:22.37]I like the flashlights on these things, man.
[44:23.97]They're so cool.
[44:24.97]I thought that was me.
[44:32.51]That happened in the rap movie.
[44:33.49]That's a ripoff.
[44:35.03]I'll try again.
[44:36.67]Just get to the car.
[45:16.29]Fuck, I was gonna do something.
[45:21.04]It's on cooldown now.
[45:21.96]I only had it for like five seconds.
[45:45.12]Come on.
[45:46.85]Oh, not this time.
[46:14.01]Jax is now on cooldown!
[46:16.29]Fuck.
[46:17.73]Um... Over there!
[46:27.54]On your... On your left side!
[46:31.75]Fuck!
[46:31.91]No!
[46:32.07]No!
[46:34.91]Ah...
[46:42.71]Man, I'm getting fucking lit up.
[46:52.14]Hey, remember, uh... Remember all those gun upgrades I skipped over because I didn't want to get them?
[47:02.53]Probably should have gotten them.
[47:06.01]Tracks activated!
[47:16.36]We got.
[48:22.38]Going good.
[48:45.34]On target.
[48:48.98]Any more commands for me?
[49:16.14]Jex mode has been deactivated and can no longer be used for six months due to the brevity of that current situation.
[49:23.44]Fuck.
[49:23.90]What?
[49:24.11]Are you serious?
[49:25.95]I don't have a six month cooldown on that, do I?
[49:31.27]Oh, fuck me.
[49:33.19]I'm gonna have to buy something here.
[49:34.11]I gotta buy some more Jex codes.
[49:36.46]I gotta buy Jex currency here.
[49:38.92]I don't know where that is.
[49:41.78]I can drop the cooldown if I put some Jex money in, so it's fine.
[49:44.66]I'll be fine.
[49:47.64]Oh, fuck.
[49:48.12]I don't know what to do now.
[49:52.46]It's like fucking $19.99 to get, like, 25 jacks and... That's so annoying.
[50:02.79]It's too expensive.
[50:03.55]It really is.
[50:04.01]They need to, like, figure out some kind of sale or plan or something.
[50:12.44]I'll buy it.
[50:12.96]It's worth it.
[50:19.83]Why am I still holding on to this?
[50:26.35]What the fuck was that?
[50:33.38]What?
[50:33.96]What's wrong with me?
[50:40.01]Why couldn't I move?
[50:45.30]It was glued to that lady's head, apparently.
[50:47.60]No, don't have to tell me.
[50:48.88]I'm gonna have to restart this shit.
[50:52.54]He's right there.
[50:53.22]Well, this is bad.
[50:54.37]It's fine.
[51:03.69]He's covered in blood.
[51:04.65]Come on, do something.
[51:10.92]What do you want?
[51:13.18]Don't think so.
[51:14.04]Ear clap.
[51:21.29]Come on, do it again.
[51:22.49]Wanna go for a grab again?
[51:23.27]Leave it to the stomach.
[51:34.11]Ooh.
[51:36.60]Come on, do something.
[51:38.54]Go for the grab.
[51:39.30]Ear clap.
[51:41.78]No, I didn't follow it up.
[51:43.04]Stupid.
[51:52.74]Pick him up.
[51:54.10]Let's go, dickhead.
[51:58.55]Anything I can do with him?
[51:59.59]No.
[51:59.97]Into the boxes.
[52:02.81]You done?
[52:03.53]I win.
[52:03.77]Really?
[52:05.21]I really just let that happen.
[52:27.05]I'm not controlling this.
[52:29.21]He's doing it on his own.
[52:31.96]Okay, now I have to go.
[52:35.56]How do I do this?
[52:36.02]I'm going to have to lose him here.
[52:46.66]They don't care anymore.
[52:47.80]I got him inside the cab and now I'm stealthed.
[52:49.83]I swear he went in there.
[53:04.61]So why'd you bring me out here?
[53:06.01]I have heard a lot about you, Wei Shen.
[53:09.67]I will get to the point.
[53:11.12]You must realize that you cannot stand against Big Smile Li alone.
[53:15.20]That's what everyone tells me.
[53:16.90]Roland Ho said I'd need other bosses to support me.
[53:19.18]Indeed.
[53:20.70]Now, I believe in harmony.
[53:23.90]Balance.
[53:25.20]Peace.
[53:26.26]And I don't mind spilling a little blood to achieve it.
[53:30.66]With Uncle Po in the hospital, there's much uncertainty in the Sun On Yee.
[53:36.01]If he recovers, we will both be stable and strong.
[53:39.53]What if he dies?
[53:40.37]The 18K presents a very real threat.
[53:42.46]Wei is an absolute unit.
[53:46.04]We will need to elect a new chairman.
[53:47.22]Why do I think that's funny?
[53:47.96]I don't know why.
[53:48.50]I don't know why.
[53:51.11]Ah, Big Smile Lee represents a step backwards for the Sun On Yee.
[53:56.57]Why continue to force girls into prostitution and pornography when there are other, less archaic, more profitable ways for us to make money?
[54:06.52]I have very different ideas about our future.
[54:10.52]I want to take the Sun On Yee forward.
[54:13.40]But it would be unwise even for me to stand against Big Smile Lee unaided.
[54:18.20]Which brings me to you.
[54:21.88]Where's the mass?
[54:22.90]The mass?
[54:23.22]Where's the mass?
[54:24.40]Where's the church?
[54:24.92]You know?
[54:26.08]You can't... For all the open world games that exist...
[54:44.00]Yeah, you can go to the strip club.
[54:46.48]You can go to the car dealership.
[54:48.63]Where's the church?
[54:49.73]And where's Mass that I can do as a minigame?
[54:53.17]Unbelievable, right?
[54:58.83]What's up with that?
[54:59.57]Why can't I go to Mass and just sit down and just listen?
[55:06.54]Ah, I didn't even see what it said.
[55:07.54]Because I instantly buttoned to the person.
[55:12.38]Some fucker named Naz is ripping me off at Top Glamour.
[55:15.46]I need your help.
[55:17.68]Let's upgrade.
[55:18.24]Mm-hmm.
[55:22.60]Tryout upgrades.
[55:23.76]Alright, let's see.
[55:24.43]We can do Rising Kick.
[55:26.37]So if you knock down, if I press X...
[55:29.14]It is essentially from WWF No Mercy, the best wrestling game ever made.
[55:36.72]When you're on the ground, you can hold left trigger and you'll stay in the ground and come up with a kick if you really want to.
[55:43.95]Best game probably ever made.
[55:45.03]If you've never played it, you're missing out.
[55:48.55]Charge kick follow-up.
[55:52.41]Hold X and then X. Okay, that's a charging kick.
[55:54.95]That's cool.
[55:57.96]That's also good.
[55:59.14]How far do we go here?
[55:59.82]Melee, Weapon, Resistance.
[56:01.60]Counter.
[56:01.84]I'm gonna do this.
[56:02.76]I like this.
[56:03.32]I can charge up the regular, uh, X. Where's the silly putty story?
[56:08.54]Okay, fine.
[56:08.96]Here you go.
[56:10.35]Um, when I was, uh, when I was 12, I, one time, I bought silly putty.
[56:17.75]And, you know, when you take silly putty and you can put it over the newspaper and you can peel it off and you can see, you can do it to comics or, you know, the funnies.
[56:26.25]Um,
[56:26.91]So one time I took a newspaper, I took Silly Putty, and I went over, um, you guys remember the comic book, the comic, uh, Foxtrot?
[56:35.96]Remember Foxtrot?
[56:36.88]Well, I went over the, like, the boy's face with the Silly Putty.
[56:41.12]And...
[56:42.64]peeled it off, and it was just that boy's face from Foxtrot, and I stretched it out, and you can stretch it and make it look really funny, and I stretched it out and put it over my face, you know, so I had like the Foxtrot boy's face, you know, and then I robbed a bank, and made off with about 12 grand.
[57:17.21]And then I was arrested.
[57:20.92]I started my streaming career when I got out of prison.
[57:23.04]Two years ago.
[57:23.86]You can't climb that?
[57:29.88]Give me a break.
[57:36.07]Foxtrot Bandit strikes again.
[57:38.03]Oh, that's it!
[57:38.57]Yeah, that's the story!
[57:49.01]I'm actually, I'm gonna get an upgrade here, because there's, there are, they're everywhere.
[57:55.30]I don't understand the point of disabling cameras.
[57:59.56]I've not, I don't know what that's for.
[58:04.30]I mean, I don't get it.
[58:07.58]Why would I want to disable the cameras?
[58:09.71]Am I enabling them or disabling them?
[58:11.93]I'm not sure.
[58:20.34]Yeah, my YouTube channel, I mean, I've just had a lot of time in the cell making videos, you know?
[58:37.63]A lot of that was not even, you know, me.
[58:39.47]All those videos, I paid a company to record those videos.
[58:51.28]I paid some company to record the gameplay, and then I edited it together.
[58:56.23]And added a bunch of like, WOAHs, and WHATS, and WHOA, WHAT THE FUCK, with my prison microphone that I made in the toilet.
[59:03.74]Alright, we're gonna go... Let's go here.
[59:24.62]Broad.
[59:26.76]Sandwich bus.
[59:28.58]I've never... I want to ride on a sandwich bus.
[59:30.44]I feel like it'd be fun.
[59:32.94]I want to be the top bun.
[59:34.33]You know what I mean?
[59:36.51]I've never been on one of those.
[59:37.45]I feel like being the top bun would be so much fun on a sandwich bus.
[59:41.77]Because you're just squished on top of some other people.
[59:44.19]I don't know.
[59:44.47]I just feel like I'd want to do it.
[59:56.60]Oh, there's the max health upgrade.
[59:58.23]Got it.
[60:00.49]Okay, how far away am I from this?
[60:03.95]I want my bike.
[60:05.35]You know who we're going to call.
[60:11.95]This guy's... By the way, the car valet is going to be in the next rumble.
[60:19.36]Guaranteed.
[60:20.44]I promise.
[60:21.80]This is the best character in the whole entire game.
[60:27.86]I gotta get a good look at him What's with the camera here?
[60:37.31]He's too perfect Caw Caw Caw
[60:57.23]This is far away.
[60:58.17]I should just get a taxi.
[61:01.55]This is futile.
[61:03.09]This is futile.
[61:04.81]Futile.
[61:07.17]Futile.
[61:13.59]Here we are.
[61:18.96]Well, I guess that just happened to me.
[61:23.13]I'm commuting to the mission.
[61:24.41]Yes.
[61:29.09]Can I upgrade the valet so I can pick the car that I want for the current mission?
[61:33.13]We have a random encounter over here, though, which... Yep.
[61:37.05]Gonna do it.
[61:39.07]Might as well.
[61:43.11]What is it?
[61:44.89]Interesting.
[61:48.97]And it is...
[61:53.40]Off the bike, I guess.
[61:56.18]The 18k are moving a shipment of product across the city.
[61:58.66]Don't let their trucks reach Aberdeen.
[62:04.80]Okay.
[62:06.66]Drive onto the freeway.
[62:13.30]That's gonna disable the vans.
[62:17.52]Easy enough.
[62:20.82]It's a rainy day mission.
[62:24.54]One truck.
[62:28.50]Shoot the tires.
[62:29.24]Actually, this might be armored.
[62:31.02]Might have to shoot the guys in the back.
[62:43.04]What happened?
[62:43.54]I dropped right into the median.
[62:53.69]Oh, what a way to go.
[62:54.55]Secret agent man.
[62:56.11]Good work.
[62:58.69]Just the man for the job.
[63:02.43]Blindly.
[63:03.57]Oh, yeah, yeah, I love it.
[63:07.05]Is he not disabled?
[63:14.53]How do you call that not disabled?
[63:17.08]What do you call that?
[63:21.43]Maybe just jump in it.
[63:23.65]No, I can't.
[63:30.41]There it is.
[63:30.93]Alright, that's disabled, though.
[63:32.69]And now I'm getting off the highway.
[63:36.99]Hold on.
[63:48.07]I want to turn the music up here because this is the Final Fantasy... This is like Final Fantasy XVI's battle theme.
[63:57.72]Let's go.
[64:06.66]Isn't that the Final Fantasy XV battle music?
[64:25.18]Kind of is.
[64:31.82]Time remaining.
[64:32.88]Yeah, it's because I just... It's over.
[64:36.20]It's not gonna happen.
[64:36.95]I lost it.
[64:37.43]Alright, that was fun.
[64:44.01]Let's turn that music down now.
[64:45.27]No, not the display.
[64:46.85]God.
[64:50.97]Turn it way down.
[64:58.97]Do I have something on zero?
[64:59.99]I think there's something on zero.
[65:04.58]I'm not gonna restart, I don't wanna do this.
[65:06.88]Oh, it's just an event, doesn't matter, who cares.
[65:08.56]I mean, it's gonna be a taxi.
[65:18.73]Taxi.
[65:19.65]One will drive by.
[65:22.39]Only do music, no talking, no commentary.
[65:26.63]No, I don't want to do that Taxi That's not a taxi Come on I could have already been there by now This is why Lyft and Uber are taking over Just open up my phone and get it Sorry, I'm just taking this person's car, fuck it No talking
[66:00.15]30-year-old loser stream?
[66:02.81]Hey!
[66:04.05]Hey!
[66:07.53]Excuse you!
[66:09.83]Excuse me!
[66:13.09]Lift, haha, uber, uber, lift, haha, what, what?
[66:16.09]Why is that?
[66:17.27]Why is, what is that?
[66:18.45]What is that for?
[66:19.17]Hey, where did you turn at?
[66:32.47]You know, I thought it might be funny.
[66:34.21]I mean, I can't do this, but I thought it would be funny at some point.
[66:38.99]If I were to go find a random YouTube Let's Play of this game, and find the name of the mission that we're about to start, turn off my microphone, turn off my sounds, and play with that in the background.
[66:55.43]And try to match it up.
[66:57.29]But I can't do that.
[66:58.55]That's against terms of service.
[67:02.39]And then I thought it'd be funny.
[67:03.35]What if I did that with like an episode of cops?
[67:06.07]Right?
[67:09.25]Get an episode of cops in the background and just turn off my sounds and try to make it queue up.
[67:19.48]I can't like stream somebody else's like videos and like pretend it's me.
[67:32.11]You somebody you know, I don't know anybody.
[67:34.15]Just use an actual police scanner.
[67:36.43]Deliver the bike.
[68:05.77]I could probably do that with an episode of Cops, though.
[68:11.63]That's gonna, that would take a little bit of time to get that, to get out.
[68:14.83]Alright, hit, hit, okay.
[68:16.57]Put this joke in the pocket.
[68:18.51]Because the next time I play an open world police crime type game like this, it's gonna be ready.
[68:25.44]And it might, it might even be like something you don't even expect.
[68:27.80]It might not even be Cops.
[68:28.70]It might be like Dog the Bounty Hunter or something.
[68:33.70]Something stupid.
[68:37.10]Go to the shipping yard.
[68:43.72]And my goal is to try to make it match the game that I'm playing.
[68:52.56]3-0-9-1-1.
[68:52.68]Yeah, put that one in the notepad.
[68:55.96]Open up notepad and write that down.
[68:57.38]Nice slick rain drifting.
[69:04.25]I like it.
[69:09.25]Nah, it's not this fucking guy.
[69:10.91]Oh, that's the bike.
[69:13.01]I thought I was gonna drive directly into it.
[69:14.81]Catch the armored van.
[69:15.53]Sure.
[69:41.36]Dude, diners, drive-ins, and dimes.
[69:45.88]Get outta here.
[69:56.57]No, that guy's... My brain.
[69:59.03]Oh!
[69:59.77]Oh!
[70:00.79]Open, please!
[70:02.07]Open it, please!
[70:02.89]Oh, they're going over the jumps!
[70:05.87]I had a bad view.
[70:11.27]no epic epic oh how epic was that asshole hi youtube come on fuckers
[70:43.64]Why would you turn this way?
[70:45.62]What are you thinking?
[70:49.31]Why would you?
[70:50.35]The game turned me around.
[70:51.69]What are you?
[70:54.71]This is how it's supposed to start.
[70:59.51]Are you serious?
[71:06.68]Put Naz in the trunk.
[71:18.41]How are you not affected by that?
[71:22.33]Just blow the car.
[71:23.04]Are they still alive?
[71:24.34]Both of you are not dead?
[71:27.08]Yes, they are.
[71:28.52]No, they're not.
[71:28.96]They're both alive.
[71:39.70]No, wait.
[71:40.14]I'm supposed to hold on to him.
[71:41.34]I'm not supposed to kill him.
[71:42.90]I just kind of did that.
[71:48.56]See what I did to your boss?
[71:50.30]Yeah, you're next.
[71:55.45]This guy should not be alive.
[71:57.01]It's really annoying that this guy over here is still alive.
[72:01.05]Get in the trunk.
[72:08.35]Let's go.
[72:08.77]Did the music get louder?
[72:12.97]I thought I turned down the music.
[72:17.95]What's wrong with this car?
[72:21.69]I can't turn the car.
[72:22.69]I can't turn the wheels.
[72:26.19]I'm not kidding.
[72:26.93]I can't turn the car.
[72:27.59]I can't turn the car!
[72:30.03]The tires were blown out.
[72:37.11]Yeah, this car can drive straight.
[72:39.95]Oh my god.
[72:42.45]You gotta be kidding me.
[72:45.82]This is gonna be dangerous.
[72:52.96]I can barely even turn, that's so funny.
[73:00.96]It's both tracking the same tree.
[73:13.49]Hit it!
[73:22.70]Shoot your gun!
[73:28.42]Okay, call Inspector Tang.
[73:32.74]Can I put him in a different car?
[73:40.03]I want to go in a different car.
[73:41.75]Drive him.
[73:43.07]This is bad, because if I pull him out and I kill him or something...
[73:48.36]No, I'm not even going to risk it.
[73:52.67]Just drive carefully.
[73:58.95]Just grinding this tire and you're on.
[74:07.62]Almost there.
[74:10.80]Almost there!
[74:19.12]What madness is this?
[74:21.30]It's madness.
[74:28.25]If I pulled him out and I smashed his head or something, I'd be in a lot of trouble.
[74:39.11]Finally, the nightmare can end.
[74:43.86]There he is.
[74:45.76]He's all cozy back there.
[74:50.50]Did we stop?
[74:51.82]Let me out of here!
[74:53.58]I fucking shit myself!
[74:55.42]Fucker!
[74:56.79]Hey, let me out of here, you fucker!
[74:59.29]My people are gonna cut you into pieces, you hear me?
[75:03.61]You don't sound threatening when you just said you shit your pants.
[75:07.39]I shit my pants?
[75:12.73]By the way, I am so strong and you're in trouble.
[75:17.35]Got him $60,000, nice I need more money There's another one right here Again We got new case
[75:47.61]Final kill.
[75:49.47]Collection... Oh, we got... A final kill sounds pretty interesting, though.
[75:54.79]I think I want to do it.
[75:55.39]Let's go eat some pork.
[75:59.80]Well, this is crunchy fish balls.
[76:04.34]Did I use the drunken fist outfit?
[76:05.52]I did.
[76:06.84]We did last night.
[76:07.76]Let's do the final kill.
[76:15.49]New outfit?
[76:15.95]How much money do I have?
[76:18.39]No, we need like another couple hundred thousand.
[76:20.39]No, no, no, no.
[76:21.09]No more outfits.
[76:21.83]I want a car.
[76:22.57]I want like the best car in the game.
[76:24.33]I need like a million dollars.
[76:25.33]We can't just blow our money on shitty cosplays.
[76:30.91]I want practical stuff.
[76:33.02]I want to get the fastest bike in the game.
[76:34.68]I need a million dollars.
[76:35.72]Nice.
[76:45.91]Where's my crotch?
[76:50.23]There it is.
[76:55.89]Shocked I haven't played the new God of War?
[76:57.35]Oh, I'm going to.
[77:01.17]That and Nintendo Labo are currently next up on the list for next week.
[77:07.72]And maybe another surprise or two.
[77:10.88]Maybe.
[77:12.52]But this week has been all about sleeping dogs.
[77:17.04]Been having a blast with this game, so I don't really want to stop playing.
[77:27.34]Mrs. Chu?
[77:30.06]Here's Mrs. Chu's last mission.
[77:32.70]It's absolutely game of the year.
[77:33.82]God of War.
[77:34.44]Sammie?
[77:43.79]Yeah, I hear it is just... It's just like the best game.
[77:49.75]By far.
[77:51.31]This year.
[77:54.01]And I'm willing to give it a go.
[77:55.99]Find Dog Eyes.
[78:13.69]Did you ask if she was cooking someone?
[78:16.69]I don't think so.
[78:19.57]Go to dog... Oh, here it is.
[78:20.51]Yep.
[78:20.77]We've been talking about dog eyes this whole game.
[78:24.31]The guy's name is even in the title.
[78:27.01]Sleeping Dog Eyes.
[78:28.59]This guy is a dog.
[78:29.83]He's Dog Eyes.
[78:31.45]It's time to go do the final kill of the game.
[78:37.79]And that's not true, but, you know.
[78:42.58]Health Shrine right here.
[78:45.46]Just hold tight while I scoop it up.
[78:57.73]Never mind, it's right here.
[79:03.19]Breathe it in.
[79:04.07]Breathe in the dead rat fumes.
[79:05.46]It's nowhere close to done.
[79:14.94]I know, I'm just being a fool.
[79:16.94]That's all.
[79:19.65]Did the wedding happen?
[79:20.41]Yes.
[79:21.13]That was one of the last things we did last time.
[79:36.10]Here's the hideout.
[79:37.62]There's going to be a gunfight in here.
[79:40.39]Or something of the sorts.
[79:41.79]I would say, if I was a person that had any thought, that's what I would be thinking.
[79:53.86]Is Dog Eyes the T-Rex?
[79:57.46]I don't get it.
[79:59.20]Is this an actual animal in here?
[80:03.66]You even had a caution tape there.
[80:05.05]Alright.
[80:11.35]Hold on.
[80:11.73]Itchy.
[80:12.21]Case, case, case, case.
[80:13.43]Hold on.
[80:13.79]Itchy ear.
[80:14.47]Itchy inner ear.
[80:17.22]I hate that.
[80:17.76]You guys know that phantom super inside of your ear itch, right?
[80:23.72]And it can never go away because you can't scratch deep enough.
[80:27.33]I wish there was a little device that I could stick in my ear and it itched inside of where my brain is.
[80:37.39]Ugh.
[80:38.67]And then you start moving your tongue.
[80:40.59]Like... Trying to itch your ear from your tongue into the side of your mouth.
[80:46.31]It's just like... And nothing satisfies it.
[81:03.91]Am I just running in here?
[81:09.39]No, I guess not.
[81:11.49]What do you mean, how high am I?
[81:13.97]Do you know how to do that?
[81:16.27]The tongue in the upright part of your cheek, ear, place, scratch.
[81:20.34]Well, now this has changed.
[81:22.98]I didn't press any buttons.
[81:27.20]Are you sure you're human?
[81:30.24]Yeah, I mean, I don't know.
[81:33.37]You know what?
[81:34.07]I've never seen my birth certificate before.
[81:39.63]And my only earliest memory I have is being 15.
[81:44.83]I don't have any other memories.
[81:50.24]And my mother used to always say a bunch of weird shit about like, you're not even from this planet, Jeremy!
[81:54.74]And I'm like, yeah, that means something crazy.
[82:01.03]Before 15 years old, all I can remember is blue lights flashing.
[82:09.70]And being very, very happy.
[82:14.14]And calm.
[82:15.88]And being surrounded by stars.
[82:22.12]No, I don't want to go over any more jumps.
[82:38.90]Alright.
[82:40.02]That was a joke that I would do.
[82:41.84]Right?
[82:42.32]That's the... Oh, I did.
[82:43.36]I jumped.
[82:44.14]And I'm dead.
[82:48.96]I would make that same scream too, probably.
[82:50.61]I love these chase sequences.
[82:57.15]No.
[82:57.83]No.
[83:07.88]Alright, environmental kills.
[83:09.12]We got quite a few of them here.
[83:10.82]Into the fish tank.
[83:16.68]Into the head.
[83:24.26]Don't you even think about it.
[83:25.96]Ooh, he got me.
[83:36.15]Come with me, and you'll be... What the fuck is in there?

[85:35.85]I had to do this sure thing.
[85:36.91]Oscar the Grouch, the guy.
[85:40.29]Am I being led to believe that he was hiding in the fishes?
[85:45.33]Not to me it wasn't.
[85:52.87]I just looked over at chat and my eyes are burning
[86:16.96]I wonder why.
[86:17.76]Maybe it's because of the bright electric yellow that's on my screen.
[86:22.40]Who's this guy?
[86:23.12]Is this Smile Lee?
[86:23.62]Oh, I get it.

[87:08.01]Like, parsnips?
[87:09.63]Oh no, they're swordfishes.
[87:11.97]That is Mortal Kombat, that guy.
[87:13.49]Nice.
[87:18.79]Here we go.
[87:19.25]Bang, bang, bang.
[87:22.63]You into the spikes.
[87:28.71]Hook has multiple uses.
[87:33.25]No, it doesn't!
[87:35.03]It doesn't!
[87:36.21]He lied to me!
[87:46.70]Oh, I unlocked a new move, didn't I?
[87:49.17]Yeah, I didn't even get a chance to try it.
[87:53.01]Shit, and I'm looking at chat.
[87:54.03]Stop looking at chat.
[87:56.89]Okay, there it is.
[87:59.00]It's a charge kick.
[88:01.18]That's cool.
[88:03.08]Easy to get people away from you.
[88:08.12]Defeat dog eyes.
[88:10.11]I don't think that'll be that hard.
[88:21.26]Come on, swing at me.
[88:22.20]Do it.
[88:23.20]Whoa, he didn't swing!
[88:24.28]Oh boy, that hurt!
[88:27.64]I need a weapon.
[88:36.35]Stat.
[88:39.49]It's that easy.
[88:42.10]Get the fuck over here.
[88:43.10]Listen, you're gonna regret this!
[88:50.98]No, I'm trying to pick him up.
[88:52.46]I've seen it this way.
[88:56.24]No, I can't do it.
[88:58.28]I can't do it.
[88:59.02]You guys saw I tried.
[89:00.14]I tried to do it.
[89:06.06]Come with me.
[89:06.54]Get in that trunk.
[89:21.27]Oh, I can't.
[89:22.30]I'm not driving.
[89:24.40]Am I driving?
[89:24.98]No, I'm not driving.
[89:28.52]Let's see how good this driver is.
[89:29.74]So far, so good.
[89:30.72]Nobody's chasing me.
[89:31.32]No gun to pull out and shoot the machine gun behind me.
[89:34.12]Right.
[89:51.88]Come on.
[89:53.24]Where are the four armored vans that are going to pull up on the highway?
[89:55.74]That just looked like fun.
[90:04.88]I'm not even sure how dangerous this would be.
[90:10.21]Is it really that dangerous?
[90:15.58]If your car popped up like that, and landed right in the forest, right, like a cat, how bad would that be?
[90:21.65]I don't think it would be that big of a deal.
[90:25.17]I think you would be like, holy shit, that was fun!
[90:27.88]Like that, see?
[90:28.54]Like that!
[90:29.08]I don't think it's that dangerous.
[90:34.82]That could support its springs and suspension.
[90:44.54]That doesn't look like fun.
[90:52.84]That looks very bad, actually.
[91:01.12]I can't even see who I'm shooting at.
[91:06.36]Come on!
[91:07.88]See?
[91:08.36]Look at how much fun that was.
[91:10.55]Tighten it up.
[91:18.92]Maybe we're good.
[91:20.40]Couple more.
[91:26.74]Popcorn jumping out.
[91:27.96]Nope, didn't make it.
[91:29.02]Sorry.
[91:31.55]Back to the restaurant.
[91:33.71]You think we're weird after?
[91:35.41]We'll see.
[91:41.79]Some good driving there.
[91:44.39]Thanks, man.
[91:47.28]Alright, take him out of the trunk.
[91:49.09]I don't want to do that again, so we're actually going to pull him out.
[91:52.07]I'm not fucking around.
[91:54.11]Chase sequence is where you have to unload a thousand rounds.
[91:56.15]No.
[91:57.33]Sit down and shut the fuck up.
[92:07.03]She's going to carve him up and turn him into a pie.
[92:08.89]Jesus, I haven't been here in fucking years.
[92:12.27]Sammy, I've been opening the kitchen for you.
[92:14.65]Look, I left the bones in there.
[92:17.07]You like it, don't you?
[92:18.98]It's cool, Mrs. Chu.
[92:20.44]I already ate.
[92:21.20]You told me to eat it all.
[92:24.40]Eat it all.
[92:25.22]Hey, what the fuck are you doing?
[92:27.17]Yeah, she was cooking that guy.
[92:29.05]That's definitely people, you're right.
[92:32.35]This is predicted.
[92:34.15]The person's stupid.
[92:35.45]Sorry.
[93:04.66]What happened?
[93:05.14]I don't want to wait till next episode.
[93:07.04]Yeah, we leveled up the soup.
[93:12.50]Extra ingredients.
[93:20.99]That would give me nightmares too, man.
[93:29.67]To be continued.

[95:07.71]Yeah, you know what was in that food?

[116:57.15]Whoa, new fat guy came into play.

[117:47.02]This is a lot of people.
[117:47.98]Alright, we're gonna have to do some tactical throws here.
[117:53.68]I'm gonna have to go bowling with a lot of these guys.
[118:01.16]That's so satisfying.
[118:02.50]It really is.
[118:03.82]Grabbing people and whipping them into a bunch of people.
[118:07.51]Like this!
[118:11.85]Who's next?
[118:16.67]Hey, I was grabbing you.
[118:17.71]Bullshit.
[118:27.51]I like the sweep kick.
[118:28.55]It's really effective.
[118:29.47]Come here.
[118:31.25]Come here.
[118:35.31]Come here.

[118:39.74]Oh!
[118:39.88]Forwards!
[119:05.39]This is fun.
[119:06.05]I love this.
[119:07.31]I'm having a blast.
[119:08.33]Here, there's like 30 people here now.
[119:11.36]Last one.
[119:16.62]How many are there?
[119:17.34]Oh, they're everywhere.
[119:25.57]I gotta build up that meter.
[119:27.45]Bad guys first.
[119:31.97]What about this guy just smoking the cigarette?
[119:35.06]Does he have anything to do with the fight?
[119:41.47]I don't think he has anything to do with the fight.
[119:43.49]He might be just like a bodyguard.
[119:44.57]I gotta break his leg here.
[119:51.63]Scare everybody.
[119:55.46]This guy doesn't... I don't... No, this guy's just a bodyguard.
[120:14.87]He's got me.
[120:18.83]Three fat guys in a row here.
[120:20.99]Okay.
[120:21.61]Careful now.
[120:22.59]Careful now.
[120:22.89]I'm in the corner.
[120:23.35]Get out of the corner.
[120:23.87]Hmm.
[120:44.91]Nope.
[120:53.76]Nope.
[120:55.74]Let's go.
[120:58.26]Nope.
[121:05.16]Stomp his head.
[121:14.03]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa there.
[121:16.19]Whoa there, easy.
[121:16.97]He's going to go for it.
[121:40.45]That's it.
[121:42.91]Game over.
[121:46.69]I got difficult to be in there.
[121:49.93]I like those.
[121:51.05]They're intense and they're fun.
[121:53.11]They throw 20 enemies at you at the same time.
[121:55.95]I like it.
[121:57.85]Extra face.
[122:00.85]Alright, now let's check out the guns thing.
[122:05.54]I can't go and get guns?
[122:09.64]Does it have to be a police car?
[122:12.70]That's a lot of money, too.
[122:16.40]We just made so much money.
[122:21.42]Definitely worth doing that.
[122:22.50]Okay.
[122:25.00]Uh, serial killer part two.
[122:29.25]No, I did not finish the island.
[122:30.61]I did not.
[122:31.05]It's gotta be a cop car.
[122:32.77]Well, let me get a cop car then.
[122:35.81]No, I can't go back up the ride.
[122:38.75]Just run.
[122:39.17]I, dude... I got plenty of car potato chips.
[122:44.97]Don't worry.
[122:47.57]There's another bag.
[122:48.33]I think Gary Busey said that at one point.
[122:59.96]There's something up there.
[123:06.59]Oh, it's just a fucking camera.
[123:15.41]Um, where's this... trying to get me to go?
[123:19.64]I think it wants me to get in a boat.
[123:23.10]Okay.
[123:25.28]We'll get there somehow.
[123:26.06]Wait, hold on.
[123:31.27]The valet?
[123:31.93]Really?
[123:33.75]You're gonna get a car down here.
[123:35.65]You're gonna get a police van down here.
[123:53.22]I think he's up on the highway.
[123:55.60]Yeah, he is.
[123:57.60]He's on the highway.
[123:58.68]He's on the bridge above me.
[124:00.88]He's up there.
[124:12.73]Where is he?
[124:14.93]He's up here.
[124:18.59]He's just fucking terrorizing people.
[124:27.95]He's just killing so many people up there.
[124:33.31]He can't drive off the road?
[124:41.93]That's too bad.
[124:42.63]He can't just drive off the road.
[124:49.52]He's trying.
[124:50.54]He's right above me.
[124:53.74]Okay, well, let's see what he does.
[124:55.34]Because I'm going to go... He's...
[124:58.09]This guy, his AI path thing makes it so he refuses to not deliver the car to you.
[125:03.99]So we're going to get out a little bit.
[125:06.53]To this part and see what he does.
[125:09.51]Just get out a little bit here.
[125:14.44]And then we'll see what he does from here.
[125:17.28]Now that I'm out here.
[125:20.24]What's his plan now?
[125:21.74]Don't jump out of the boat.
[125:22.58]Don't jump out of the boat.
[125:23.34]Don't jump out of the boat.
[125:28.62]Okay, I have to get in the boat.
[125:31.85]Where is he?
[125:34.19]Has he figured it out?
[125:39.15]He's not figuring it out.
[125:45.21]He's still on the mini-map.
[125:48.83]He's on the move.
[125:50.53]He's moving.
[125:52.45]I can't exactly see where he is, but he's trying to come down here.
[126:01.82]I'm going to turn over here.
[126:02.64]Maybe he can figure it out from this way.
[126:07.95]I need my car, man.
[126:09.09]Get it over here.
[126:11.67]Can you see him?
[126:12.65]I can't see him.
[126:14.07]I thought he was up there.
[126:14.83]Looks like he's trying to get on a different highway.
[126:20.32]We're going to circle around this way.
[126:23.16]He's still on the move.
[126:24.76]There he goes.
[126:25.46]He's going on this highway.
[126:26.52]Let's see if he can meet us here.
[126:31.58]This is more important than anything else right now.
[126:41.18]I think he's stuck up there.
[126:45.51]See the white blip on the minimap?
[126:48.01]That's him desperately trying to get over here.
[126:55.63]I think if I go far enough away, he might have to figure it out.
[127:02.66]Let's see.
[127:03.02]Let's just open up the map and see where he is.
[127:06.72]There he is.
[127:07.18]Okay.
[127:07.88]Car valet.
[127:09.64]Okay, he got off the highway.
[127:17.97]Where is he now?
[127:23.69]What is he doing?
[127:30.07]Get over here, man.
[127:35.60]Local man's not drinking water?
[127:37.10]I've been drinking water.
[127:39.00]What are you talking about?
[127:43.72]I'm just trying to bait him in here.
[127:45.70]Is he on the other road?
[127:46.52]I mean, this is fairly important.
[127:48.76]I wouldn't be doing this for this long if it wasn't important.
[127:55.54]He's still driving around in circles up here.
[127:57.28]I just saw him.
[128:02.72]Well, you can't miss him.
[128:03.58]He's the guy in the big police van.
[128:08.05]I've been drinking water, I'm fine!
[128:12.53]Here he comes.
[128:15.28]Just go down the on-ramp, man.
[128:17.10]Let's get on the dock.
[128:26.68]Drink water or pre-recorded?
[128:28.72]No!
[128:30.00]I'm not drinking any water.
[128:32.66]I think he finally figured it out.
[128:33.98]Let's see if he gets down here.
[128:35.72]Oh, you stupid fucking idiot.
[128:41.62]I need to investigate this.
[128:42.59]I need to see what he's doing.
[128:46.79]Where even is he?
[128:52.05]Here he comes.
[128:53.05]Oh god, he figured it out.
[128:57.61]There he is.
[128:58.03]There he is.
[129:01.19]It's only a matter of time before he figures out how to come down the stairs.
[129:05.98]There he is!
[129:06.42]You see, that was so menacing.
[129:11.16]Oh, God.
[129:16.67]Where is he?
[129:18.65]He's getting closer.
[129:22.87]Whoa!
[129:23.05]Where's the car?
[129:28.45]You didn't even bring it.
[129:46.06]Okay, well, at least we tried.
[129:47.54]I want to get in the fun car.
[129:55.13]I hope this is good enough.
[129:56.47]Me!
[130:00.13]Next case.
[130:00.71]Let's just wrap up.
[130:01.55]Where is it on the map?
[130:05.57]It is up here.
[130:07.31]So we're going to take a little sightseeing route around the corner.
[130:15.63]Got a fast boat.
[130:17.57]I'm surprised that he just walked.
[130:24.02]No, he did not.
[130:26.78]I can't.
[130:27.46]I can't control the boat.
[130:32.54]That boat sucks.
[130:34.74]Is it a land boat?
[130:36.67]No.
[131:01.77]I wonder why.
[131:07.01]Lady on the beach.
[131:08.41]Lady on the beach.
[131:09.20]Lady on the beach.
[131:09.88]Lady on the beach.
[131:14.78]No one suspects a thing.
[131:20.26]Have a good day, ma'am.
[131:21.50]I'm a police officer.
[131:22.22]I can't do that.
[131:29.01]Thank God.
[131:29.87]Alright, get over here.
[131:31.03]Come on, bring it down.
[131:34.13]Where is he?
[131:34.57]What?
[131:35.37]What?
[131:53.10]That sounded like something went into water.
[131:55.82]That sounded like water splashing.
[131:57.98]Oh, there it is.
[131:58.63]Alright.
[132:03.47]Hey, thanks, man.
[132:08.61]It sounded like he drove it into the water.
[132:11.15]That was a splash.
[132:12.07]That was not a crash.
[132:19.23]He ghost read it and dove.
[132:24.11]I'm not listening to the GPS, we're going this way.
[132:38.63]Get off and turn left.
[132:40.72]He's still in the car.
[132:41.98]No he's not, is he?
[132:46.96]He's not still in the car.
[132:54.77]Yeah, I know, y'all just witnessed a crime.
[133:00.76]He's in the back.
[133:02.92]Just waiting.
[133:05.56]Waiting to surprise Duck Laomi.
[133:17.35]I didn't have things on, that's why everyone got annoyed.
[133:21.83]The guy was just doing the beanbag Sonic.
[133:26.32]You know, I mean, referencing an old stream that we did, like, a couple months ago, whatever.
[133:31.64]That's what that was.
[133:43.97]In memory of the best boy.
[133:49.59]I really do miss that guy.
[133:52.34]That's one of my favorite fictional characters, is Beanbag Sonic.
[134:02.70]No, not dabbing.
[134:03.98]The dabbing part was stupid.
[134:06.30]The actual fun boy was a good boy, you know what I mean?
[134:17.20]Stupid, spindy, swing-around...
[134:21.54]Fly around the corners.
[134:23.78]Who made this road?
[134:25.18]I don't understand this.
[134:27.26]Why wouldn't you just carve a path that went straight down?
[134:33.20]Right?
[134:33.64]You could have it be, you know, a couple of turns.
[134:36.15]But why all these turns?
[134:39.27]Was the guy just having fun when he designed the road?
[134:42.39]Straight down.
[134:43.77]Like an escalator.
[134:44.87]For cars.
[134:53.07]Too steep?
[134:57.60]That's not too steep.
[135:05.74]Alright, here we go.
[135:06.40]Part two.
[135:10.23]How does incline work?
[135:14.19]Well, first of all... It's alright to have a couple of turns, but when they're all turns...
[135:22.97]Like, where's the architecture?
[135:26.69]Vocal dehydrated doesn't understand topography.
[135:33.93]First, I'm not going to go in the hospital, because... Actually, are these outside or inside?
[135:38.13]One's outside.
[135:38.63]The other one is in there, and we're going to get a new... I didn't get a clumsy reward, so we're fine.
[135:50.61]We're gonna get a new move, so that's gonna be sick.
[135:56.85]Statue.
[136:02.70]Into the hospital.
[136:04.64]Check the hospital records for a suspicious activity.
[136:08.86]After I take this thing from your hospital.
[136:15.06]I thought this one, I thought this guy's peeing in the corner.
[136:20.12]Yeah, if you're curious, don't even ask.
[136:22.51]There is no punching or kicking in the hospital.
[136:24.27]There you go.
[136:24.83]That's how you tell somebody off.
[136:27.41]Saving lives.
[136:28.39]Oh shit, I have to hack this.
[136:30.39]Does it matter that anyone's watching?
[136:49.43]There we go.
[136:49.71]Bingo.
[136:50.01]1, 2, 3, 4.
[136:51.10]We're gonna go with 2, 1, 4.
[136:51.72]Let's go with 6.
[136:54.10]Okay, bingo.
[136:57.50]Cracked it.
[136:58.02]I'm pretty good at those.
[137:18.89]Bug the doctor's office before he returns.
[137:20.77]Woo!
[137:24.87]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[137:30.19]That's not a doctor's office.
[137:31.41]This is a... Don't worry.
[137:33.83]They give an extra, like, two minutes.
[137:35.03]I'll be fine.
[137:35.63]What am I bugging?
[137:42.96]What am I going to bug?
[137:43.52]This?
[137:44.69]Bug it.
[137:44.97]What am I bugging?
[137:47.03]Oh, and the stupid vent.
[137:48.01]I thought I was putting it under a piece of gum.
[138:03.07]Double up.
[138:09.07]Come on.
[138:10.87]Find it.
[138:15.63]Alright, we're good.
[138:21.03]Where am I getting the screwdriver and why can't I use that as a melee weapon?
[138:23.55]Crack the doctor safe before he returns.
[138:25.93]Jeez, you give me a lot of random fucking techno babble shit to do.
[138:31.73]This is just the gear check for can you do all the hacking things.
[138:36.71]Fuck, it's 20.
[138:37.15]Fuck!
[138:49.85]Yeah, we just gotta, we gotta gear wall, gear check.
[138:52.87]Can I leave?
[138:57.53]Do I have to have an internal monologue here?
[139:00.41]No, we're good.
[139:07.59]Hacking a mechanical safe with a cell phone.
[139:09.25]Well, I probably have an app that can hear the clunkers in there.
[139:16.61]So, I mean, I'll buy it, you know?
[139:23.27]Give me another level up, man.
[139:24.09]I'll take that.
[139:24.41]Nothing suspicious.
[139:24.87]Should get three stars for this one.
[139:26.21]Case closed.
[139:53.12]Missed it.
[139:57.77]We're going to get a whole level here.
[140:02.57]That's so good.
[140:03.45]I should just do this a few more times.
[140:05.33]I got all the upgrades.
[140:07.76]So now we got... Awaken, disarm, gun-wielding enemies without a struggle.
[140:12.18]Just get it.
[140:14.90]See, now I'm doing the firearms, which... Slow motion follow-up, recoil compensator, more focus.
[140:21.07]I didn't get any of these.
[140:23.87]Melee training.
[140:27.34]So this is the next one up here.
[140:32.00]This one sucks.
[140:33.80]Actually, maybe not really.
[140:35.00]A follow-up strike on stunned opponents.
[140:37.79]Jumping power roundhouse kick.
[140:39.41]I believe that's the one I'm going to do here.
[140:40.97]Increased damage and power on that combo I already do a lot.
[140:47.03]Alright.
[140:52.54]So, um, the Jade Statue.
[140:56.55]What?
[140:58.95]Why is this right here?
[140:59.69]Oh, no.
[140:59.93]Wait, is this a triad mission?
[141:03.31]This is right here, though.
[141:04.43]What?
[141:04.65]What?
[141:04.75]What?
[141:05.17]What?
[141:05.39]Because I didn't get the case?
[141:06.65]There's like five grand in there.
[141:07.69]Who cares?
[141:23.23]way, my boy.
[141:24.49]Uncle, you're okay.
[141:26.01]Thanks to you.
[141:28.25]Sister Chang told me about the troubles between you and Big Smile Lee here.
[141:34.61]You must stop this fight at once.
[141:36.01]We must be united against our true enemies.
[141:40.66]Yes, of course, Uncle Po.
[141:42.26]Tell me all about it and speak directly into the microphone if you could.
[141:46.16]Just lean into my chest, Grandpa.
[141:48.52]He's been a loyal foot soldier to the Sun Han Ji.
[141:51.70]Please speak very clearly about all the in-depth family plans.
[141:55.97]Your initiation is young Leon.
[141:59.15]He has been selling to schoolgirls and was ordered to stop.
[142:02.67]He switched to the 18K instead.
[142:05.28]Make an example of it.
[142:06.94]Thank you.
[142:07.88]I will.
[142:08.84]If any of your people have not been properly initiated, bring them with you.
[142:14.14]I'm going to fail the mission, and don't worry.
[142:15.68]We still need to decide who will lead us.
[142:19.45]What about you, Park Mark?
[142:21.62]You are my greatest friend.
[142:23.02]I want to be able to watch the cutscene so that we can skip the cutscene.
[142:25.20]You know my wishes better than anyone.
[142:27.90]Would you not take my place?
[142:29.18]How do you do, fellow Triad members?
[142:31.02]I am your advisor.
[142:32.36]I cannot lead in your place.
[142:34.04]So, if not you, who then?
[142:39.66]Two-chin-sao.
[142:41.26]He is your true nephew.
[142:42.91]Your blood.
[142:43.55]That guy is fucking huge.
[142:46.15]Who better to receive your wishes and keep the family together?
[142:51.51]Well, his name is Tu Qin.
[142:59.42]I mean... He may have gotten that name 20, 30 years ago, when he didn't have a third one.
[143:04.64]Alright.
[143:10.16]Cool.
[143:11.57]Let's immediately fail this mission.
[143:18.43]Well, that didn't fail the mission.
[143:21.40]How do I fail this mission?
[143:22.71]Wait, where's the case?
[143:24.37]Case?
[143:25.19]Where's the case?
[143:28.63]Where's the case?
[143:31.17]In the lobby?
[143:32.56]Case?
[143:37.88]Where's that case?
[143:38.34]Ma'am, have you seen a case in here?
[143:39.32]I'm looking for a case.
[143:50.76]Case!
[143:52.26]Found it.
[143:58.51]And then I'm gonna drive my car into a river.
[144:04.71]This one's got something good in it.
[144:15.18]Really?
[144:15.44]About 20, 20?
[144:19.74]What's wrong with you?
[144:22.60]I found Akose kicks and five grand.
[144:27.32]There's another case.
[144:30.89]This is two cases.
[144:32.39]Alright, I found one of the cases.
[144:33.71]Let's go get the other case.
[144:40.43]Case.
[144:44.27]I slit that guy's throat with my hands.
[144:48.30]Found it.
[144:51.66]I was so quick in my martial arts, I cut his throat.
[144:56.02]Five grand.
[144:56.52]Told you it was just five grand.
[144:57.54]Not even choosing it.
[144:58.34]Alright, so how do I... Let me die now.
[145:07.09]Okay.
[145:07.83]What's the fastest way to die?
[145:11.97]Play in traffic?
[145:12.63]Run in traffic?
[145:18.44]I'm gonna say run in traffic.
[145:20.04]And try to time it correctly to get hit by a car.
[145:23.15]Alright, sounds good.
[145:24.13]Like that guy did.
[145:26.17]See?
[145:26.51]It's not that hard.
[145:27.81]That guy already did it.
[145:29.45]He was practicing.
[145:35.27]Come on!
[145:35.83]Get out of the way!
[145:38.05]I'm trying to die here!
[145:43.33]God damn it, man.
[145:48.10]Drive!
[145:48.62]Yes, there's a dead body in the road.
[145:50.65]Fucking idiot.
[145:53.27]Come on.
[145:57.41]One, two, three.
[146:05.88]Have the valet crush me.
[146:08.84]I can't call anybody.
[146:10.40]I can only call Jackie.
[146:14.70]Case.
[146:16.11]Nope.
[146:21.33]Well, I have to die!
[146:22.33]I can't reload the save!
[146:23.71]Like, what would you have me do?
[146:32.69]I can't reload the save.
[146:34.51]I'll be like a mission before.
[146:36.89]Wait, I can cancel it in the menu?
[146:39.89]Can't- What the fuck?!
[146:41.03]Cancel mission?! !
[146:46.21]There's a cancel mission button.
[146:48.33]And why would there be a cancel mission button?
[146:57.09]I've never been on a mission and pressed the start button.
[146:59.62]Do you understand that, guys?
[147:02.18]Have you seen me be on a mission and press the start button at the same time?
[147:06.78]It's never happened.
[147:09.84]How would I know that?
[147:10.96]You know that, but I don't.
[147:17.67]What am I going to dress up as?
[147:21.72]There's not one in every game.
[147:22.96]What are you talking about?
[147:23.72]I'm going to be a swap man.
[147:29.70]Let's do grubby clothes.
[147:32.90]Or should I be bronze man?
[147:37.72]We're going to go bronze man.
[147:53.74]No, I'm being Bronze Man.
[147:55.32]I'm being Bicentennial Man.
[148:03.13]I'm going this way.
[148:14.42]Who am I calling?
[148:15.44]No, a lot of police.
[148:17.72]Shit, there's more.
[148:39.32]Okay.
[148:40.78]So, don't be a cop.
[148:41.96]I have seven minutes?
[148:44.02]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[148:46.18]I can't call anybody.
[148:52.55]Drive the car?
[148:53.37]What are you doing?
[148:54.73]This thing sucks.
[148:55.45]I gotta get out of this.
[148:59.37]Excuse me.
[149:01.93]Excuse me.
[149:02.63]Put the phone down, my god!
[149:05.47]Oh my fucking god, this is why.
[149:08.32]You stupid fucking Xbox controller.
[149:15.52]Can you please?
[149:16.78]Hello?
[149:18.00]Am I working again?
[149:19.06]Yes.
[149:19.62]Alright, good.
[149:24.46]Please, god.
[149:29.45]Get out of the way.
[149:33.16]I've got a thing to do.
[149:34.12]No, I don't need the garage.
[149:45.95]Why am I using the Xbox controller?
[149:48.11]Because I fucking feel like it.
[149:50.35]Do I need a reason?
[149:51.37]Do we need a scientific math reason as to why I'm using a controller right now?
[150:18.10]Let me do like a four page thesis as to why I'm using an Xbox controller.
[150:32.89]He's going fucking fast, man.
[150:44.38]Hey, how you doing?
[150:48.22]Oh, that didn't stop you.
[150:50.96]That sounds like a good read.
[150:54.21]Why I'm using an Xbox controller?
[150:56.57]Why Jeremy?
[150:58.71]You see, the thing is...
[151:07.91]You guys got me on, like, fucking tilt.
[151:10.34]I'm trying to... Listen.
[151:11.74]I'm trying to defend to somebody why I'm using an Xbox controller and not paying attention to the fucking mission.
[151:19.12]Like, this is why.
[151:20.73]Just go.
[151:21.55]I'm not... I don't have to defend myself on why I'm using a goddamn controller in a video game, okay?
[151:27.85]See my thesis next week.
[151:34.16]Somebody calls me a dickhead for using an Xbox controller.
[151:36.96]And I can't get over it.
[151:47.33]Let me have this!
[151:48.67]Can I have something?
[151:54.97]Do it!
[151:55.31]What is... Do it!
[151:59.33]What are they, not close enough?
[152:01.93]Oh my god.
[152:06.43]He said why?
[152:07.51]No, no.
[152:08.73]We're talking about three days of this.
[152:12.13]Somebody called me a fuckface for using an Xbox controller.
[152:15.55]Can I please get in this car?
[152:25.61]Is this guy still in here?
[152:30.51]Don't let him out of the truck.
[152:33.65]Oh, fuck.
[152:34.19]Okay.
[152:46.02]What did I ever do?
[152:47.78]What did I ever do to deserve this Xbox controller hatred?
[152:57.62]Should I plug in my PS4 controller?
[153:00.10]Okay, I got him.
[153:01.21]Is that guy dead?
[153:03.65]Tragic story of modern medicine, Inspector.
[153:05.49]Not every patient makes it.
[153:08.13]I'm leaving this guy in the parking structure off Kwok Street and Central.
[153:11.33]Make sure you send someone to let Calvin out of that trunk.
[153:17.27]Dr. San confessed.
[153:18.95]He's done more than 20 transplants for 18K in the past two years.
[153:21.99]The guy gives urban myths a bad name.
[153:24.51]He'll get 10 to 20 in maximum security.
[153:27.13]When you consider that all his victims were triads, I wonder how long he'll actually serve.
[153:31.15]Why is this guy glowing?
[153:32.76]But I'll personally sleep a lot better knowing he's not out there.
[153:35.08]Doesn't bring back your friend, but I think it's fair to call it justice.
[153:48.52]Something good in here, I think.
[153:54.62]He's a mad cat's controller.
[153:58.77]Look at how much more experience I would have.
[154:01.17]Doctor's coat?
[154:01.77]That's cool.
[154:05.39]But it wasn't the case.
[154:08.46]Is it an empty box?
[154:09.26]Alright, there's a camera watching.
[154:15.40]I can't do it.
[154:17.29]Although, I'm going to just hack this apparently.
[154:23.89]Why is everybody calling me a furry?
[154:25.37]Where did we even get that?
[154:26.40]Where did we go from there?
[154:27.92]How did we go from Xbox controller to learn how to cancel mission to Jeremy is a furry?
[154:34.80]What did we do it?
[154:47.67]Shit.
[154:49.25]Shit.
[154:51.21]Ooh.
[154:54.37]Where are the thugs?
[154:54.95]I don't see any thugs.
[155:02.51]Can I drive this car?
[155:05.27]No.
[155:13.03]I have frog Sona.
[155:17.04]Let me get my friend to come pick me up.
[155:19.66]No, never mind.
[155:27.56]I actually don't need you.
[155:28.88]I'm going to get a fast car from over here.
[155:30.20]I do not need you.
[155:35.76]I'm sorry I even called.
[155:38.30]Just pretend I didn't call.
[155:39.32]I know it's a very expensive trip.
[155:53.58]Watch this.
[155:57.15]Hey.
[156:03.73]He got hit.
[156:04.85]Hey, thanks.
[156:05.87]I got my own, though.
[156:06.85]I appreciate it.
[156:10.43]Oh, shit.
[156:11.03]I just... I want a different one, though.
[156:15.67]Thank you for completing my joke circle.
[156:20.40]Something fast.
[156:29.75]Alright, let's return the statue.
[156:31.60]This is far away.
[156:35.42]Not that far.
[156:35.92]It'll be fine.
[156:36.72]Get out of the way, lady.
[156:41.42]Shouldn't have been using a controller.
[156:45.81]You should have used keyboard, mouse, and an Elgato stream deck.
[156:52.69]And an attachment for your league moves.
[156:57.50]The sidebar.
[156:58.40]Whatever the hell the thing from Razor is called.
[157:10.69]What is that?
[157:11.47]I don't care.
[157:17.15]Too late now.
[157:18.83]What happened here?
[157:33.53]Bad dudes through this.
[157:38.63]No.
[157:40.02]You guys are small fries.
[157:41.30]I got a big fish to catch.
[157:45.26]Sorry, guys.
[157:48.20]I've got a large fish to catch.
[158:12.74]I'm surprised that didn't hurt me.
[158:20.84]Why is everybody freaking out?
[158:22.90]What happened?
[158:24.83]What happened?
[158:27.47]Why is everybody freaking out?
[158:28.43]What happened?
[158:29.23]What did I miss?
[158:29.83]Did I miss something funny?
[158:33.23]Why is everybody freaking out right now?
[158:37.43]I found one of your statues.
[158:39.85]The important part of the collection.
[158:42.61]How are you doing?
[158:45.05]I'm fine.
[158:46.41]That's one of those questions you shouldn't ask.
[158:48.05]Listen, I guess those are the rules.
[158:52.44]But someone should ask it, even if you ask it of yourself.
[158:58.04]Are you a Zen Master now?
[158:59.54]Of course.
[159:00.72]Didn't you know?
[159:04.80]Let's go learn the more damage super jumping power how roundhouse kick.
[159:15.32]Nice, let's just bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[159:19.98]So it's just the same move I was doing before, but just does more damage, okay.
[159:36.41]That what just get out of here if I was that guy I would quit I Would go be like a woodcutter at that point.
[159:44.98]You know, I mean go do anything else doesn't matter Can I interest you in computers?
[159:58.67]Holy shit that guy that was embarrassing.
[160:01.05]Oh
[160:07.59]Yeah, we're good.
[160:14.93]There's a tournament in here, though.
[160:18.17]Should I just destroy this tournament?
[160:24.24]Where's the actual tournament?
[160:27.32]Is it not in there?
[160:31.32]That's the tournament symbol, isn't it?
[160:37.41]Oh, there it is.
[160:37.91]Okay, over there.
[160:39.23]Did I already do this one?
[160:41.63]I don't remember if I... No, I did this one already, I think.
[160:43.75]Yeah, I already did it.
[160:49.13]I already did this one.
[160:50.61]I remember it.
[160:53.21]It was right outside.
[161:00.00]Why am I collecting furry statues?
[161:03.96]You guys.
[161:05.56]Ay, ay, ay.
[161:11.46]That is so obedient today.
[161:20.20]Initiation is good though.
[161:24.20]How much money do I have actually?
[161:27.16]Couple more missions and we need to buy an insane cart.
[161:38.05]I really do love bikes, but I want a super fast car.
[161:41.80]I have a nice car, I have a couple police cars, but... I want something better.
[161:47.32]Something more.
[161:50.60]Something daring.
[161:56.97]I'm gonna stream from the fursuit.
[162:00.03]Alright, what would it take... I wonder what it would actually take for me to stream a full stream in a fursuit.
[162:07.69]A lot.
[162:08.09]Because there's no way I would do that.
[162:10.95]In a million years.
[162:15.41]There would have to be some other reason why I was in it.
[162:20.55]If I'm ever on camera in a fursuit.
[162:23.67]That means that somebody broke into my house.
[162:26.35]And I am in immediate danger.
[162:30.64]If I don't do this.
[162:31.86]And this is what they're telling me to do.
[162:34.32]So just know that, right?
[162:35.34]So that'll be like the code word for you guys to know that something wrong is happening.
[162:39.01]If I'm in a fursuit on camera on stream, I am in immediate danger.
[163:03.95]Because that's the only way I can think of being.
[163:06.37]Or, unless it was like some video or some special occasion.
[163:10.11]No.
[163:11.63]A clown suit is not a fur suit.
[163:13.37]A clown suit is a clown.
[163:14.72]It's a person dressed with funny makeup on.
[163:20.62]Black your tail if you're being held hostage.
[163:31.86]Easy.
[163:33.96]That guy yelled.
[163:34.92]I'm going to pretend I didn't hear it.
[163:36.20]Because how would I?
[163:39.78]Stop dabbing.
[163:40.84]Stop that.
[163:41.94]You're bringing back flashbacks.
[163:50.00]Someone broke into your house.
[163:54.77]Someone broke into your house and made you wear one of the suits in your closet.
[163:58.47]No, they brought it with them.
[163:59.53]See, I'm not an officer anymore.
[164:01.75]I changed.
[164:03.01]Is this better?
[164:03.69]Alright, we can skip this.
[164:18.33]Call Jackie.
[164:26.79]No, they brought your suit with you.
[164:30.63]No, they brought their suit that they wanted me to wear.
[164:34.56]You know what I'm saying?
[164:36.66]So they brought a fursuit.
[164:40.54]And... You know, this conversation is absolutely moronic.
[164:47.26]I refuse to give this conversation another ounce of my breath.
[164:53.78]Because I don't want to talk about this anymore.
[164:56.95]We're gonna fucking talk about something else.
[165:03.17]But if you, but, if... He brought his fursuit to my house with a machete.
[165:09.71]And he's swinging it around crazy going like, put this on or you're fucking gonna chop you up under sausages.
[165:14.83]And I'm like, alright man, I'm gonna do it.
[165:16.49]There you go.
[165:28.58]Clumsy.
[165:32.94]Jacky, you're gonna love this.
[165:35.58]What's going on, Wade?
[165:37.24]Well, you're about to become a full member of the Sun On Yee.
[165:40.08]Fuck me!
[165:41.98]Are you sure?
[165:43.30]100%.
[165:43.42]Yeah, baby!
[165:46.16]I fucking did it, yeah!
[165:48.76]Oh, don't worry about it, my man.
[165:50.90]It'll be your turn soon.
[165:52.80]Jacky, they're making me a red pole.
[165:55.23]What?
[165:55.75]Holy shit, Wade!
[166:02.17]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[166:03.59]You guys are fucking actually hilarious.
[166:06.53]A massage?
[166:06.87]Cool, dude!
[166:07.35]You seem to have a really bad neck issue.
[166:09.21]Now you got a sale.
[166:31.52]I got 1200 bucks to spend 960.
[166:32.88]That's a net positive.
[166:36.00]What the hell was that?
[166:38.80]Face meter.
[166:43.38]Oh, that's a double sandwich.
[166:44.82]Oh, you never get to see this.
[166:46.22]You never get to see this.
[166:48.88]This is a Big Mac in the making here.
[167:00.37]They're trying to combine sandwiches.
[167:01.83]You gotta be careful, though.
[167:02.97]No toothpick there.
[167:04.11]Ah, see?
[167:05.33]No toothpick.
[167:05.99]They fucked it up.
[167:08.41]Don't ever order a club sandwich, double-decker sandwich like that.
[167:10.79]This never works.
[167:13.58]As they can see, they've separated.
[167:14.60]I think if you're funny, she'll fall for it.
[167:18.52]Same thing, isn't it?
[167:35.73]Initiation time.
[167:40.58]1, 2, 3.
[167:45.26]Search for Young inside the Galleria.
[167:49.96]That's a fake store.
[167:50.74]It's not that one.
[167:52.68]You alright?
[167:53.12]You sound like you're getting hurt.
[168:00.88]What is causing you such distress?
[168:04.20]Okay, you figured it out.
[168:05.00]Good.
[168:14.18]Alright, that lady.
[168:19.46]It's just the thugs.
[168:20.54]Don't worry about anybody else.
[168:22.48]They're blending in.
[168:23.68]The thugs are blending in with the regular people.
[168:31.35]Oh, shit.
[168:36.31]Do more damage with that one now.
[168:47.26]You really just can't beat this guy.
[168:48.61]I love this outfit.
[168:50.19]It's beautiful.
[168:51.45]Nope.
[168:53.59]Nope.
[168:53.97]Okay.
[168:57.83]See the little side tap?
[168:58.79]The little ear tap?
[169:00.62]That's it, right?
[169:03.80]No, one more?
[169:07.42]I don't think it was this guy.
[169:08.78]You got in the way.
[169:12.37]Ow.
[169:27.72]Little help can you do something about this man like punch him from the other side I could use a little bit of help we're gonna counter him
[170:03.51]Get up.
[170:06.11]He's punching air.
[170:07.71]He's practicing.
[170:10.23]He's Twitch chatting.
[170:20.32]Oh, now he decided to do something.
[170:28.12]Jackie, let's go!
[170:30.78]Jackie, let's go!
[170:31.56]Come on!
[170:32.18]Let's move!
[170:37.30]That guy is digging deep in his nose.
[170:41.20]Wow.
[170:42.60]Wow.
[170:44.40]That's an actual... He's eating it.
[170:45.88]Is that illegal?
[170:48.58]That's illegal.
[170:49.12]That's public indecentment.
[170:51.08]I'm trying to get him in the trunk.
[170:52.14]That's public indecentment.
[171:06.81]Nah, get in.
[171:17.14]He was digging deep in his nose and eating it.
[171:19.60]Public indecentment.
[171:21.16]Indecency.
[171:21.90]Indecentment.
[171:23.14]Whatever.
[171:30.97]Drift!
[171:42.50]Property damage.
[171:44.18]Alright, initiate me.
[171:47.90]I would like to be initiated.
[171:49.06]Spray paint me.
[171:52.35]Spit in my face.
[171:53.97]Throw something at me.
[171:55.11]Make me eat raw fish.
[171:57.59]Make me eat raw steak.
[171:59.36]From today forward, your lives will be forever changed.
[172:02.58]Find a pillowcase and then put it over my head.
[172:04.36]Because today you are my brothers.
[172:06.86]We're bound to each other by blood, sworn to protect each other to the death if necessary.
[172:14.27]With our brotherhood comes duty.
[172:17.05]You will obey our leader in all things, and you will show your brothers respect always.
[172:24.26]With our brotherhood comes power.
[172:26.52]The sun on you does not die.
[172:28.47]The sun on you does not forget.
[172:30.81]It rewards its sons with wealth, status, and honor.
[172:35.16]It protects their businesses and their families.
[172:37.70]It cares for their children as if they were their own.
[172:41.27]Our brotherhood pays our enemies with pain, suffering, and death.
[172:45.99]And none suffers more than a traitor.
[172:48.27]To drink pledge.
[172:49.45]Pray your brothers, and you will die a thousand times over, slowly, in the dark.
[172:54.85]Oh, shit.
[172:55.27]Usually we just drink.
[172:56.05]The sun on ye and the gods themselves will burn your soul from your body and crush the ashes with our heels.
[173:04.60]There are 32 oaths.
[173:06.10]With them, you are bound together.
[173:08.20]With them, you become sun on ye.
[173:12.06]Are you ready to begin?
[173:18.07]So, what's the initiation?
[173:21.57]I guess that's it.
[173:26.40]$100,000.
[173:27.10]I got a houseboat?
[173:29.54]Oh, wow.
[173:31.64]Wait a second.
[173:32.12]Is that a million dollars?
[173:34.70]How many zeros was that?
[173:42.23]I read your report.
[173:43.35]I'm flattered.
[173:44.15]Was it a slow day or something?
[173:45.59]Pender is very impressed.
[173:47.33]I'm not going to lie.
[173:48.01]I'm sort of impressed, too.
[173:49.45]He wants you to dig around and see what you can find.
[173:51.39]100 grand?
[173:52.07]Sonny Woe says it's a priority.
[173:54.42]I've read about it.
[173:55.44]He reps entertainers, dabbles in porn with allegedly some...
[173:58.58]human trafficking mixed in why go after him he's not sun on ye to bring down the sun on ye we have to take down the people who support them cut off the revenue sources dismantle the network this is how we hit him where it hurts sunny's revenue stream is massive golden man I'll see what I can do Raymond by the way you hear anything about dog eyes he seems to have disappeared haven't heard a thing
[174:22.75]Why am I doing this?
[174:23.46]Jackie?
[174:23.66]So I'm like a double agent, but I'm having trouble?
[174:25.26]He's a criminal, Wade.
[174:26.42]You're a cop.
[174:36.89]I hate to be a broken record, but it sounds like you're getting attached.
[174:39.29]I'm not getting attached.
[174:41.19]I'm just... I'm not a fucking idiot, okay?
[174:43.47]He's part of my cover.
[174:44.77]He brought me in.
[174:45.79]He's the one who vouched for me.
[174:47.19]And now you're so high up, you don't need him.
[174:49.07]He's outlived his usefulness, so we're bringing him in.
[174:51.49]I'm taking this up with Pendrive.
[174:52.77]This came... I'm getting too invested.
[174:54.29]Taking him in accomplishes nothing, and it makes my job harder.
[174:58.19]I'm not doing it.
[174:59.01]You don't have a choice, alright?
[175:01.25]It's a direct order.
[175:02.21]Yeah?
[175:03.13]Direct order?
[175:04.25]Well, that's an order you can shove directly up your ass, Raymond.
[175:08.94]Because I'm a criminal now, please arrest me too.
[175:12.90]Well, I mean, let's be real.
[175:14.14]I did just get a houseboat and a hundred grand.
[175:17.36]That's way more than they pay a police officer.
[175:22.33]So, houseboat and a bunch of money?
[175:26.23]I mean, he's turning here.
[175:36.33]Let's change outfits.
[175:42.35]I got a houseboat.
[175:44.29]This is so cool.
[175:50.55]Crime doesn't pay?
[175:51.35]Yes, it does.
[175:52.27]It pays very well.
[175:54.19]But... Eventually... Eventually, you're going to go to jail.
[175:59.43]Prime... It pays very well.
[176:03.21]If you commit crimes and you make a lot of money, of course you'll have a houseboat.
[176:07.49]And eventually, you're going to go to jail.
[176:10.43]I mean, might take a few years.
[176:12.07]Might take a decade.
[176:14.25]How long did it take Willie Nelson to get arrested?
[176:17.17]No, not Willie Nelson.
[176:18.47]Whitey Bulger.
[176:20.36]Took Whitey Bulger like 50 years before he was arrested.
[176:24.88]You know?
[176:30.94]Speaking of arresting people.
[176:37.39]Nothing going on right now?
[176:39.01]Let me take a look at the boat.
[176:52.61]That's so cool.
[176:53.73]A house boat.
[177:01.71]Not only is it a house, it's also a boat too.
[177:08.72]I'm just going to buy one of these eventually.
[177:10.00]Here's my plan.
[177:11.58]I'm going to buy a houseboat.
[177:13.54]Like a million dollars or something, right?
[177:16.08]And then float it out to sea in the middle of the ocean.
[177:19.41]And run a casino in the middle of the ocean.
[177:21.67]I'm going to have my own gambling ring.
[177:24.05]But it's legal.
[177:25.47]If I drive this boat like 75 miles off the coast of the United States and we're just in the middle of the ocean.
[177:29.44]Like there's no, laws don't exist.
[177:32.20]So I can have my own off the record casino out there.
[177:46.07]There's one in the game already.
[177:53.27]There's literally a thing in that game.
[177:54.91]That's funny.
[177:56.61]See, they know what they're doing.
[177:57.51]Alright, I see blinks.
[178:00.73]I see quite a few blinks over here.
[178:04.55]There's a case up there.
[178:06.43]No, thank god I didn't jump over that.
[178:12.01]I don't think you could be more wrong.
[178:13.69]No, casino boats.
[178:15.93]Casino boats are real.
[178:18.43]They get off far enough away, and then all of a sudden they can sell alcohol to you.
[178:23.16]They don't need a liquor license.
[178:25.00]It's just, it's total, it's total carnage over there, man.
[178:32.72]Where the fuck is... I mean, I see that.
[178:35.48]Oh, that's a $50,000 envelope.
[178:36.97]Is that what I was seeing?
[178:38.71]No, it's over there.
[178:44.44]Can I climb this any other way?
[178:45.82]I think I have to be in my... I gotta be in my houseboat for this.
[178:47.82]Yeah, I could jump from houseboat to houseboat.
[178:56.81]Yeah, international water party.
[178:59.59]Why do I climb up there?
[179:02.53]Do I have a dock?
[179:13.93]No, we're temporarily using this skin until we have enough money where it doesn't matter.
[179:21.27]Climb here?
[179:22.05]There we go.
[179:23.89]What?
[179:25.27]Oh, please.
[179:26.09]Don't even tell me.
[179:28.23]Horseshit.
[179:32.77]Horseshit?
[179:33.27]What are you talking about?
[179:40.44]From here to there?
[179:44.40]Has to be, right?
[179:46.30]You gotta be kidding me.
[179:49.04]All the way up top?
[179:50.04]Well, there's this one.
[180:02.11]Fuck.
[180:02.79]Twelve.
[180:07.35]Dumb.
[180:16.63]This has gone on for too long, chat.
[180:19.73]What is this one?
[180:24.26]Wasn't there one up there, too?
[180:26.86]Or have I lost my mind entirely?
[180:28.82]Well, we're going to go from this one to that one.
[180:41.72]Nothing up here.
[180:43.00]Let's get a bird's eye view, make sure I don't miss anything.
[180:44.80]Got that case.
[180:46.50]There's a blinking bulb over there, and there's the money envelope over there.
[180:52.08]Let's go!
[180:52.42]I mean, yeah, you guys have your own established... I mean, look, we can tell stories, you know?
[181:07.95]You've got your own stories to tell.
[181:12.63]50 grand.
[181:12.97]There it is.
[181:16.81]You guys want to have your own stories?
[181:18.57]I'm not going to stop you.
[181:24.25]Anything else on this boat?
[181:27.42]I don't believe there is.
[181:30.64]Oh, man.
[181:30.98]We got more blinking shit.
[181:34.16]What is that?
[181:34.72]Is that a case?
[181:36.84]Health thing back here.
[181:39.90]Okay, I gotta get it.
[181:41.74]It's right there.
[181:52.58]Pilot the houseboat?
[181:54.05]No, it's attached.
[181:55.85]Can you?
[181:56.19]I mean, there's a party going on on that boat.
[182:01.53]No, it's not.
[182:03.01]Those are just chairs.
[182:05.27]Boring.
[182:08.68]Oh.
[182:09.70]Well, there's people up here.
[182:23.46]Just back him up into the water.
[182:26.36]See you later.
[182:27.68]Sleep with the fishes.
[182:29.00]Literally.
[182:29.58]2100.
[182:34.56]And a gun.
[182:35.44]Alright.
[182:37.79]I have a weapon now.
[182:41.90]Boat race?
[182:43.44]I'm going to lose the gun.
[182:45.78]What is that?
[182:46.92]Are you serious?
[182:49.57]She just died.
[182:51.13]Dude, I really don't want to do this, but... I mean, I understand that you're angry.
[183:06.27]I gave him every opportunity to get the fuck away from me.
[183:11.67]Okay?
[183:13.35]We all are aware of that.
[183:14.37]We've all saw it.
[183:14.93]That was self-defense.
[183:27.90]That's a houseboat race.
[183:29.32]Let's go.
[183:37.35]Oh no!
[183:40.86]Reading chat, reading chat, reading chat, reading chat, reading chat, reading chat.
[183:48.63]Not reading chat this time.
[184:00.12]I do want to go up and jump with those people, it's fun.
[184:06.49]Thanks.
[184:09.85]What are you doing?
[184:13.95]Those guys are working with the two people in the first two places.
[184:16.65]Just sabotaging.
[184:21.08]What is this?
[184:21.52]Alton Brown's show?
[184:22.62]How much you pay for that sabotage?
[184:28.38]I should have bid on that.
[184:29.22]I could have really used that instead of these guys.
[184:37.27]Why am I going much slower than that?
[184:41.32]What is with the directions here?
[184:48.62]Okay.
[184:48.96]Weird.
[184:49.18]Second place.
[184:50.34]Not all is lost.
[185:06.06]There's nitro?
[185:06.76]There's no nitro.
[185:07.44]Alright, big turn.
[185:19.60]Asshole.
[185:22.42]Almost there, straight away, and I should get it. 87%.
[185:44.62]Cool.
[185:44.78]$20,000.
[185:44.82]Dragon helmet.
[185:46.70]Stop reading me.
[185:49.60]$20,000 and a dragon helmet.
[185:50.94]Cool.
[185:56.77]That scared me.
[186:00.23]That's not a jump.
[186:01.15]That's a wall.
[186:03.43]There's a garage over here, though.
[186:04.29]I want to look.
[186:05.97]Mirage and a Fight Club.
[186:06.99]Let's take a gander, shall we, guys?
[186:08.63]What do you guys think?
[186:10.05]What do you guys think?
[186:18.65]I only have one complaint about this game.
[186:20.71]Only one.
[186:21.09]This game is fantastic.
[186:23.99]Only one complaint.
[186:25.57]Would you like to know what it is?
[186:28.65]You can't jump on boats.
[186:30.89]You have to, like... I cannot just get on here.
[186:34.61]That's it.
[186:35.99]I have to press Y and grab the boat and drive it.
[186:40.59]I'm not allowed to climb up here, apparently.
[186:48.78]Alright, I just looked over at the chat.
[186:50.16]And I have to say, I do commend your perseverance.
[186:54.26]With the fursuit joke.
[186:56.24]And the fursuit furry thing.
[186:59.56]Is that a... We got a case over here.
[187:03.80]Going for it.
[187:11.51]How long has it been?
[187:12.47]It's been, like, it's been an hour.
[187:23.50]That's a light.
[187:27.88]It is.
[187:28.64]But, in our travels, there is a health booster thing to smell.
[187:43.31]Just go sub-mode for 10 minutes.
[187:47.11]Sub-mode.
[187:48.01]No, you don't have to put it in sub-only mode.
[188:04.50]The subs will do it.
[188:14.80]Only one more and there's one up there.
[188:15.84]I'll get it.
[188:25.20]We should put the chat in furry-only joke mode.
[188:29.84]And if you don't make a furry comment, then you get talked out.
[188:33.35]Like, I mean, right?
[188:36.17]Don't do that.
[188:36.75]I'm just kidding.
[188:37.53]That was...
[188:40.48]That's a joke that I need to write to the mod Discord channel.
[188:46.15]You know what I'm saying?
[188:47.47]That's like an insider little mod joke that I'll make with the mods.
[188:50.71]Like, I put it in furry only mode, you know what I mean?
[188:53.37]And I just... I mean, it was funny that I said that, right?
[188:56.91]It's just a little inside mod funny joke.
[189:16.64]Get me out of the ocean!
[189:21.14]Please, somebody.
[189:22.24]Somebody throw a rock and hit me in the head and kill me.
[189:24.98]Throw a rock.
[189:26.68]Throw a rock at me, please.
[189:27.98]Oh no.
[189:32.98]Escape.
[189:45.86]We've lost control.
[189:49.88]Send in the National Guard.
[189:51.20]We've lost control.
[189:52.34]I was trying to grab him.
[190:05.58]I wasn't trying to kill him.
[190:11.46]Let's get that health boost.
[190:15.22]Where's it?
[190:15.52]Up top?
[190:25.46]Damn it!
[190:30.87]Where do I climb from?
[190:31.93]I gotta go up here.
[190:41.71]Yes, I'm playing a C-3PO case.
[190:44.57]God damn it.
[190:45.53]No, there is a case up there.
[190:46.75]No, there's not.
[190:49.39]Fuck that light.
[190:56.71]There it is.
[191:05.17]90%.
[191:05.21]It's not 90%, it's 60%.
[191:06.87]And I'm not gonna have this on forever.
[191:08.05]I'm taking it off right now.
[191:09.91]I'm gonna go take a look at some cool cars.
[191:17.89]wheels of fury what is that this isn't a race is it something else entirely okay I know somebody's calling me I don't give a jackie how's it going wait man good thing you called man I got something man this could be big for us can I please walk off you were talking about yeah
[191:44.13]It's stacked with the resistances.
[191:47.82]The case.
[191:48.74]The case.
[191:49.24]I don't care about any cases anymore.
[191:55.88]God damn it.
[191:56.62]No.
[191:56.88]Cancel mission.
[192:04.77]No.
[192:05.21]God.
[192:05.65]I'm here.
[192:06.13]No.
[192:15.81]Thank god you guys taught me I could do that.
[192:17.33]You guys are fucking so smart.
[192:26.68]That's so far away.
[192:30.38]Thank god I got a bunch of fucking chatters in here that are just perfect in every single way.
[192:40.98]Not sandwiches!
[192:41.98]Sandwiches!
[192:45.65]High five me.
[192:48.53]I wanna take a cab.
[192:51.61]I wish I could call a cab like you can in GTA.
[192:59.11]Just my luck, you turn around and one spawns.
[193:03.89]Cab!
[193:05.95]Cab!
[193:07.77]Cab!
[193:10.89]Cab!
[193:11.91]There we go.
[193:12.55]Hire taxi.
[193:15.03]This is very far away.
[193:16.08]We're gonna go over here.
[193:20.10]Thanks, man.
[193:26.14]I appreciate it.
[193:26.78]So what is this?
[193:47.92]Y'all have climbed over a bush.
[193:52.11]Raiding and running.
[193:53.05]Raiding, chat, and running.
[193:54.97]Shouldn't be doing that.
[194:02.72]I got a fence, huh?
[194:08.02]Can't kick the fence down.
[194:16.69]I got a feeling this is going to unlock another garage or something.
[194:21.03]Talk to Dr. Tang.
[194:23.39]Doc, what's up?
[194:26.39]We have a problem.
[194:29.73]What kind of problem?
[194:31.15]Well, I designed this car.
[194:33.61]for one of our wealthiest industrialists.
[194:35.71]It's a very special car.
[194:36.89]What does it do?
[194:37.51]So why do I have the feeling this story doesn't have a good ending?
[194:39.89]It wouldn't exactly pass customs, so I had the parts shipped here separately.
[194:43.84]I figured nobody would notice.
[194:45.98]And?
[194:46.58]Somebody noticed.
[194:48.06]Actually, it feels like everybody noticed.
[194:50.00]The base model arrives today, and every gang in Hong Kong is out to get it.
[194:54.46]Okay, intercept the convoy.
[194:55.58]Don't blow up any of the cars.
[195:26.22]And I can't break through a chain link fence.
[195:40.43]So do not blow up these cars.
[195:42.85]That's what I'm under the impression that we're doing.
[195:48.51]This is the worst car?
[195:51.69]I mean, there are far worse cars in this game than this.
[195:55.47]There's a statue up there.
[195:57.93]But I don't really care at the moment.
[196:04.91]No, not this again.
[196:05.81]I don't want to go up the side winding road.
[196:12.82]Hollywood Hills in GTA 5.
[196:14.94]I don't want to do that.
[196:15.70]Where's my hovercraft?
[196:23.10]One of the ten cars won't explode when you drive it.
[196:25.95]What do you want about it?
[196:39.27]Okay, intercept the convoy.
[196:41.87]Find the DZS-90.
[196:42.52]Okay.
[196:42.70]DZS-90!
[196:54.47]So how do I know what a DZS-90 is?
[197:00.89]Is there a special way for me to know this?
[197:02.45]Alright, I don't know if that's... Is that a DZS-90?
[197:25.01]DZS-90.
[197:25.55]Vehicle explodes.
[197:32.90]Okay, so we're just going from bomb to bomb?
[197:36.06]That's gonna blow.
[197:36.80]That's gonna blow in 30 seconds.
[197:38.78]Goodbye!
[197:41.17]Oh, shit.
[197:42.09]Okay, I understand this now.
[197:53.33]Don't flip it over.
[197:56.81]Don't be dumb.
[198:07.45]At some point, you're the T-1000.
[198:10.23]And you need to call somebody.
[198:12.16]You need to call the guy in front.
[198:14.40]And say, hey man, um... Watch out for the fucking Tin Man.
[198:19.56]Because he's jumping from car to car.
[198:22.48]You know what?
[198:23.14]Just wait till he gets close and then slam on the brakes.
[198:28.54]That would solve this problem.
[198:31.55]What the fuck?
[198:32.31]Okay, I'm fine.
[198:32.87]I thought that was me.
[198:33.69]This thing is nice.
[198:36.69]If they slam on the brakes, I will fly forward.
[198:48.95]Who is this?
[198:49.47]The Batman car.
[198:50.03]That would be so... Come on, man.
[199:14.97]I got a much faster car than you guys Yeah, sorry Now get out of the way Hong Kong So Hong Kong is not China It's a different thing
[199:44.13]Tell that to the State Department, he said.
[199:45.49]I didn't technically kill him.
[199:53.12]The lamppost did.
[199:54.26]I may have hit the lamppost, but he died not by me hurting him.
[200:17.40]For some reason, I didn't think it was over here.
[200:26.47]Well, I got a ramming upgrade.
[200:29.59]90 ramming upgrade.
[200:31.41]DZS 90 ramming upgrade.
[200:32.91]Cool.
[200:33.43]So, do I just get this car now?
[200:37.33]Interesting.
[200:40.00]Water is not wet.
[200:43.14]Hahaha.
[200:51.31]What's next?
[200:55.15]I think we just need to go to bed.
[200:58.05]Oh, we need to call Jackie.
[200:59.30]I remember I deleted him from my calls.
[201:01.60]Deleted him from my list.
[201:03.28]I got something, man.
[201:06.78]This could be big for us.
[201:08.22]You still got that plan you were talking about?
[201:10.04]Yeah.
[201:10.92]You in?
[201:11.76]We could go tonight.
[201:12.94]Drop by my place and I'll tell you all about it.
[201:15.20]Oh, bring a car, okay?
[201:17.24]Mine's in the shop.
[201:20.18]I had to hang the phone up.
[201:23.42]Oh, I'll bring a car, Jackie.
[201:24.62]You're going to like this one.
[201:33.01]Fire doesn't burn itself.
[201:34.89]It's only when it gets on other things.
[201:36.55]Water itself isn't wet.
[201:40.55]I've seen the video.
[201:41.41]I've seen the arguments.
[201:43.54]But at some point, you're just talking about semantics.
[201:51.43]Like, so, water is liquid, right?
[201:53.90]Water is a liquid.
[201:57.16]It gets things wet, but water is wet.
[201:59.57]You know, you're just talking about the philosopher shit.
[202:01.95]You're talking about... I don't go that way.
[202:04.17]I don't think about it like that.
[202:05.79]Hey, Jackie.
[202:06.47]Let's hit Kennedy Town.
[202:07.96]I'll explain on the way.
[202:10.34]Water is not wet.
[202:13.22]Vantics are the argument.
[202:14.14]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[202:15.38]You can't argue some antics.
[202:16.73]Water is not a liquid?
[202:17.79]Maybe you should take a few days off.
[202:36.54]It ain't clay You can't oh, I think I'm good I think I'm getting the jaded here I guess Sometimes I wake up
[202:58.45]That shut him up.
[203:02.72]Sometimes I wake up, man, and it's just like... Well, that sucks, man.
[203:07.75]It's hard to hear that.
[203:08.75]She's good.
[203:09.63]I haven't talked to her.
[203:11.71]Let's wait until it gets dark.
[203:14.73]Put this on.
[203:17.76]Yeah.
[203:21.05]Is ice water?
[203:23.59]Yes, it's been chemically changed.
[203:25.31]It is water that has been changed.
[203:30.52]It's DNA structure.
[203:33.32]To a point where it is something else.
[203:37.34]Just like water vapor.
[203:38.54]Is that a gas or is that vapor?
[203:41.40]It's chemically changed.
[203:43.77]Internally.
[203:44.99]There's all kinds of acids that get added.
[203:53.84]Fast talk your way through the guards.
[203:58.60]Go find the tool shed.
[204:10.44]Hey, guys.
[204:12.54]Inspection.
[204:15.86]Inspection!
[204:17.65]Garbage collection.
[204:18.77]Oh, sorry, brother.
[204:20.37]Didn't recognize you.
[204:23.81]Yeah, garbage collection as we watch him do this.
[204:26.05]Holy shit, that guy's talented.
[204:30.55]You know, people probably ask him how he stays so fit on the job as a garbage collector.
[204:35.50]Apparently like that.
[204:58.42]What?
[205:00.18]That's not a good way to... That smooth talking my way into this place?
[205:05.62]I just threatened murder.
[205:09.18]I just said I was going to fucking kill this guy.
[205:25.54]Good job smooth-talking, man.
[205:26.78]Alright, you tell me to take the cutting tool, I'm going right for the scissors on there.
[205:38.37]Holy shit.
[205:41.01]This is bad.
[205:41.97]I could really hurt somebody with this thing.
[205:51.00]Clown car.
[205:55.03]Might as well.
[205:55.47]Hey.
[206:01.30]Beat the thugs.
[206:02.20]Okay, not armed.
[206:24.19]The solution is so obvious.
[206:27.89]We're going to get them all in one fell swoop.
[206:29.55]We're going to bowl into them.
[206:30.61]Going to come from an angle here.
[206:33.07]As long as we get three of them here.
[206:34.70]Well, hold on.
[206:35.32]Right.
[206:35.78]One, two, three.
[206:38.62]He did the same scream.
[206:39.78]Hey, easy.
[206:54.02]Okay, we're good.
[207:00.53]Oh no, I drove 20 miles per hour, 15 miles per hour into a wall.
[207:05.45]At least I have an equalizer.
[207:17.79]Oh, he came in swinging.
[207:30.91]Anybody else?
[207:34.21]Uh-huh.
[207:34.45]We got one more guy.
[207:35.57]Watch out.
[207:36.17]Watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out, watch out.
[207:37.49]He's still alive.
[207:40.53]I'm only gonna do this three more times.
[207:47.00]You know what?
[207:47.32]No, fuck that.
[207:48.96]Picking door number two.
[207:50.26]Door number three, technically.
[207:58.65]No.
[208:00.87]Send in the clowns.
[208:01.57]Come on.
[208:01.87]Woo!
[208:02.27]Let's go.
[208:02.77]Go.
[208:02.91]We have to jump on there.
[208:30.22]You gave me a shit bike.
[208:32.06]You gave me a shit bike.
[208:33.02]Now I gotta get on the damn highway.
[208:35.58]Stop with the directions.
[208:37.58]Got it.
[208:37.86]I'm gonna have to jump on the back.
[208:43.24]That's exactly what's gonna have to happen.
[208:46.66]Don't you dare.
[208:49.18]No, not that guy.
[208:54.06]No, don't put it on a different car.
[208:57.43]That's gonna happen.
[208:59.22]I know that's gonna happen.
[209:00.40]It's gonna screw me so bad.
[209:01.86]See?
[209:03.04]Stop it!
[209:19.25]Water.
[209:20.03]There is water here.
[209:25.15]Got it.
[209:38.51]You know, that definitely hurt his hand way more than it hurt that guy's head.
[209:42.34]I think this is going to explode.
[209:44.96]Do I have to...
[209:57.97]You can't, Wei.
[209:58.63]No matter what happens, Jackie, I won't leave you behind.
[210:01.55]I'll always come back for you.
[210:03.21]Hey, thanks, Wei.
[210:04.77]I wouldn't be here without you, man.
[210:07.07]I know it.
[210:07.95]I'll always appreciate it.
[210:09.63]I should be doing a better job getting you back.
[210:11.83]It's not your fault, Wei.
[210:13.17]You know, I'm thinking about a lot of things.
[210:18.42]Just wait till we're done having our conversation, then you can chime in.
[210:28.43]Yeah.
[210:29.49]Are you gonna get on the bike?
[210:36.32]Or, I guess we're just... Okay, so I'm gonna leave.
[210:41.64]It's been real.
[210:42.28]Thanks a lot.
[210:44.33]No, you can't get on this.
[210:46.43]I have to get another car.
[210:47.77]Let's park in the middle of the road.
[210:51.54]We'll get one of these stupid little minis.
[210:55.68]Just leave him?
[210:56.36]No, the mission won't fail.
[210:57.42]There we go.
[211:10.34]Too bad.
[211:11.84]We can put the...
[211:14.18]Two people could fit on the bike before.
[211:15.54]Remember the girl?
[211:19.40]You take the girl on the bike at the back of the motorcycle?
[211:21.42]Way, way... Like, 12 hours ago.
[211:25.75]Why would... Why would you do this to me, GPS?
[211:28.83]It's a very ugly car.
[211:37.49]It's a gopher.
[211:41.61]If you drive around in a car that's called a gopher, you had better be over 45.
[211:47.65]And you better have... You better have more than four kits.
[211:53.46]Other than that, I don't believe you that you own one.
[212:06.72]Don't attack Jackie!
[212:09.76]When did I attack him?
[212:10.71]I don't remember doing that.
[212:31.16]Dryad points.
[212:35.08]I didn't attack him.
[212:35.78]I didn't do anything.
[212:39.13]I didn't do anything.
[212:50.05]So they're bringing him in.
[212:51.67]He's the low-tier criminal.
[212:54.83]I'm upset that they actually went through with it.
[212:57.67]So I transformed into my superhero self.
[213:01.55]As you're well aware.
[213:04.40]My alter ego was that guy, and now I transform.
[213:09.51]So what is this thing that's crossing right now?
[213:13.51]What is that?
[213:15.19]Who's in there?
[213:16.41]What's going on there?
[213:17.65]Hold on a minute.
[213:18.11]What's going on there?
[213:18.65]Why is this thing driving away?
[213:19.42]Who's in there?
[213:21.78]Get out!
[213:23.72]Get out!
[213:26.04]A little clown car just drove by and there's an indicator on it.
[213:29.30]Get out of the way!
[213:31.31]Fucking gopher!
[213:43.04]Who's in this car?
[213:54.96]Who is this?
[214:02.65]Oh, damn.
[214:03.75]Alright.
[214:08.79]It's 23 grand.
[214:09.13]Alright.
[214:11.35]Sure.
[214:15.04]I will take $20,000.
[214:15.56]Alright, now we do have to start to investigate how much more money we need before we get the best cars in the game.
[214:29.49]I gotta be getting close.
[214:32.81]I'm getting close to a million dollars.
[214:34.09]I'm certain of it.
[214:45.59]It's on the other side.
[214:52.39]Fuck.
[214:52.63]22,000.
[214:52.65]22,000!
[214:53.10]And I can't even get over there from here.
[214:57.48]I have just royally fucked myself.
[215:09.19]It's down here.
[215:09.89]Thank you.
[215:23.18]$500.
[215:23.20]It's alright.
[215:25.02]In the grand scheme of things, we made a lot of money.
[215:30.12]Speaking of money.
[215:31.14]$543,000.
[215:33.64]I would like to see.
[215:36.46]Where are the best fucking cars in the game?
[215:39.61]Which garage?
[215:41.21]Vehicle store.
[215:43.65]Is there one down here?
[215:44.81]There is no vehicle store down here.
[215:48.45]This one up here.
[215:54.01]Have I been to this one yet?
[215:58.29]Kennedy Town.
[216:00.23]I'll try this one.
[216:03.04]There's also a brawl here.
[216:04.56]Martial Arts Club.
[216:07.12]I did that one, didn't I?
[216:12.75]Kennedy Town has the best ones.
[216:15.83]To Kennedy Town we go.
[216:21.19]Your Xbox controller makes you bad at driving.
[216:24.80]Don't pick up the gun!
[216:25.90]Why would you drop it to get in the car?
[216:28.08]Get out of the other side!
[216:30.72]Oh my lord.
[216:33.12]Thank you.
[216:39.27]Time to go.
[216:47.01]Squeeze on.
[216:54.55]The low battery sound from Metro.
[216:58.65]Well, here's the thing.
[216:59.49]A lot of games probably use the same libraries for stock audio libraries.
[217:06.95]Or it might be engine related.
[217:08.51]A lot of games are made on Unreal.
[217:11.17]A lot of games are made on... Unity.
[217:15.04]Not just, but Unreal.
[217:16.72]I'm not sure what engine that this is on, but... You have to imagine that there's a video game developer stock shit.
[217:22.94]That a ton of people use.
[217:24.00]With thousands of files.
[217:30.38]Loyalty free everything.
[217:33.61]Made on Roblox Studio.
[217:35.83]Sorry dude.
[217:38.49]Cock audio libraries.
[217:50.40]Okay, I know that those chickens on the map are not restaurants.
[217:53.47]So, what are they?
[217:55.77]Is this cockfighting?
[217:56.49]We might have to... I haven't... We'll see what it is.
[218:01.13]We have to try it once.
[218:07.64]First we need to see how much a million dollar Kennedy car is.
[218:17.90]Make some money?
[218:18.42]I want to see exactly how much money is needed to do any of this stuff.
[218:27.16]Check it out.
[218:27.44]I don't know what the hell those guys are doing, but here's a garage.
[218:40.18]How are you?
[218:41.98]What do you have for sale?
[218:44.26]120,000.
[218:44.30]The Panzer.
[218:47.77]Piss off your neighbors.
[218:51.17]The Wangan GS6.
[218:55.73]I already have one of these.
[218:57.71]The Blast.
[218:58.33]Italian.
[219:02.78]Italian.
[219:05.54]Velocita.
[219:08.37]A car for the man who has everything and wants everyone else to know it.
[219:14.90]Well, that's a $519,000 car.
[219:17.02]Is this the fastest bike?
[219:27.96]Or are there other bikes that are faster than that?
[219:29.66]I like the Panzer.
[219:32.25]I like the way that car looks.
[219:40.41]That is the fastest bike in the game.
[219:41.75]So this is the fastest... This is the best car in the game.
[219:53.78]Well, I did say I wanted the fastest bike first.
[220:03.14]Okay, so now I don't own this.
[220:08.60]Okay.
[220:11.67]Pretty fast!
[220:19.29]Doesn't matter, we're both made out of metal.
[220:24.13]Let's see what the top speed on this thing is.
[220:28.13]Oh boy.
[220:29.23]Oh yeah, this is... Can I have another one?
[220:43.63]Dropped that one Why am I treating this like an ice cream store?
[220:50.43]Mike my ice cream fell off the cone oh No, it's okay.
[220:55.15]It's alright.
[220:55.49]We'll give you another one.
[220:56.85]Oh, okay.
[220:57.23]Thanks Like get another one I already bought it I own it for life.
[221:09.42]I have insurance I
[221:16.16]see watch owned to see let's get a different paint job though where I jumped off my bike into the ocean gold baby now we make sense fuck it's not gold it's like
[221:40.50]Oh well.
[221:41.58]I want another one.
[221:42.46]Alright, we're gonna top speed this thing.
[221:44.72]Then we're gonna go have a chicken dinner over there.
[221:52.69]Look at how fast that is.
[221:54.83]Didn't even need to tap it.
[221:55.61]Let's get back out on the road.
[221:59.11]This thing actually really is uncontrollably fast.
[222:04.44]It's so fast I'm having trouble seeing how to even get out of here.
[222:11.62]Down here.
[222:20.28]Up to the road.
[222:20.92]To the left.
[222:24.75]Alright, punch it.
[222:25.39]Once we get on the highway, I'm gonna drive as fast as I fucking can.
[222:38.79]Whoo!
[222:40.52]Now we're talking!
[222:48.03]Jump!
[222:49.77]No, it's not a jump.
[222:50.49]Usually they have that for their jump.
[222:54.93]This bike is loud as hell, though.
[222:58.51]Woolly!
[222:59.41]He came out of nowhere.
[223:00.09]He actually did come out of nowhere.
[223:07.04]Well, I didn't get the armored car.
[223:20.13]Actually, it didn't scare me.
[223:22.45]This thing's awesome though.
[223:24.85]Exactly what I wanted.
[223:27.37]Handling is perfect.
[223:28.35]I'm gonna bring this thing into a race.
[223:34.31]I will tear the floor up.
[223:36.43]And then I'm gonna go get the car.
[223:38.47]I want the most expensive shit in the game.
[223:40.85]I will never be satisfied.
[223:48.08]Sorry.
[223:48.56]Busy.
[223:50.76]There it is.
[223:52.42]Perfect.
[223:54.84]As long as I'm going fast enough, I can jump over any car.
[223:58.00]Unless it's a truck.
[224:06.06]Oh, I forgot to do the cock-bite thing.
[224:09.32]Oh, I will.
[224:09.78]Eventually.
[224:15.42]He's busy being rich.
[224:27.08]Let's do it.
[224:30.12]Handling's perfect after multiple crashes, but you know how these games work.
[224:33.36]It's impossible to crash.
[224:35.52]You know, some people make speedruns and challenges for different games.
[224:40.70]Oh, I'm going to take no damage in Dark Souls.
[224:44.72]I'm going to beat a game in an hour.
[224:47.58]I want to see a guy or girl, whatever.
[224:50.14]I want to see somebody beat
[224:55.21]Sleeping Dogs or GTA without getting in a single car accident.
[224:58.73]No fender benders, no hurting any pedestrians, nothing.
[225:03.07]A clean total run of GTA 5.
[225:08.36]No accidents, nothing.
[225:09.62]No damage to anybody.
[225:12.30]That's a challenge.
[225:14.24]It's literally impossible.
[225:24.13]A game like this?
[225:24.87]Trying to do anything without getting in one fender bender?
[225:34.73]It's not possible.
[225:35.61]But you know there are plenty of people... There are plenty of people that thought that you couldn't beat... Like Mario 64 in four minutes.
[225:44.38]You know what I mean?
[225:45.86]And somebody did it!
[225:50.56]Anything's possible.
[225:52.44]Did I do it?
[225:52.92]Hey, ugly.
[226:26.02]Press A?
[226:30.32]I want these guns, though.
[226:32.56]Give me your weapons.
[226:33.68]I require extra ammo.
[226:40.93]Are they all 36?
[226:41.63]Yes, they are.
[226:45.81]Give me a drink.
[226:47.17]Energy drink time.
[226:57.17]increased damage all around not where I wanted to go what are you serious oh no she's fine don't worry guys everything's gonna be fine
[227:33.67]You know what I'm saying?
[227:43.60]This guy, headshot guaranteed.
[227:49.28]100,000 dollar bet.
[227:49.78]100 fucking thousand dollars headshot.
[227:51.67]Still on the table.
[228:28.04]Never told you how I was going to get it.
[228:29.27]I just told you I was going to do it.
[228:34.29]Anything?
[228:34.55]Let's check out the rooms.
[228:37.01]There's probably cases or something in here.
[228:44.98]Beeps.
[228:45.78]Safe.
[228:46.44]Oh, wait a minute.
[228:47.48]I can crack the safe.
[228:56.05]Cash in here?
[228:59.79]I need money.
[229:00.23]I need that car.
[229:00.85]How much is in there?
[229:12.64]Was there anything in there?
[229:17.97]What was the purpose of me opening the safe?
[229:19.89]Alright.
[229:26.10]That was fun.
[229:31.59]Stealing from a hospital.
[229:34.43]It's from the last mission.
[229:38.79]What was that?
[229:39.67]Ready?
[229:40.45]3, 2, 1.
[229:40.95]Oh, wait, no.
[229:42.81]I feel like I'm a fucking Bicentennial man for this.
[230:00.99]Get out of here.
[230:04.61]Do it again.
[230:14.34]Sayonara.
[230:15.30]Keep it up.
[230:20.48]Jack's wrong.
[230:21.86]He finally realizes this slow-mo.
[230:23.30]Now I knew it was there.
[230:24.32]Get out of the way, dude.
[230:58.20]Thank you!
[231:07.51]Sorry, I'm addicted to caffeine.
[231:08.79]I need to do this.
[231:15.16]Hack the security console.
[231:16.40]Uh-oh.
[231:26.87]Got the 8 right and 0...
[231:36.19]Five, zero, five's gonna go zero, I'm gonna say five, zero.
[231:46.09]What?
[231:52.01]Shit.
[231:53.59]Shit, shit, shit, what have I not done?
[231:56.54]Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, no threes.
[232:04.68]Aye!
[232:19.18]One is here.
[232:26.75]Seven, eight.
[232:27.53]Alright, nine.
[232:28.41]Got it.
[232:28.89]Get out of my life.
[232:32.69]Alright, alright.
[232:33.27]I'm coming back.
[232:33.61]Wait.
[232:37.28]Poe's going to die.
[232:39.36]Ricky.
[232:39.54]Ricky.
[232:41.96]Ricky.
[232:59.32]Rick 8!
[233:02.41]I'm back, man.
[233:09.53]Nothing to hack.
[233:17.40]These fat guys are so much easier to shoot with guns.
[233:30.58]You will be flashed.
[233:33.02]Yes, you will.
[233:35.04]Yes, you will.
[233:48.51]Got him!
[234:16.76]Hide!
[234:17.10]Hide!
[234:20.80]Reload.
[234:27.22]Turn around and shoot somebody!
[234:28.52]What are you doing?!
[234:30.48]What are you... Why was I not turning around and shooting him?!
[234:34.06]I was holding down left trigger!
[234:35.44]Oh, come on, man.
[234:37.36]I was holding down... Why was I backing up like that so awkwardly?
[234:54.81]Not this time.
[235:02.74]This is the climax of the whole story.
[235:06.72]How many fat guys can you shoot with one gun?
[235:15.44]A-caw!
[235:28.70]Stop it!
[235:36.48]It's clear.
[235:36.98]Come on.
[235:38.22]Good.
[235:44.29]I think we're clear.
[235:46.69]I need shit.
[235:47.31]That was close.
[235:48.71]Nice work.
[235:49.15]Oh, man.
[235:51.14]We just got lucky.
[235:52.72]Where was our backup?
[235:53.94]Who was looking out for us?
[235:55.65]Fuck.
[235:56.53]No one ever looks out for you in this town.
[235:58.19]The ally guy is the final boss.
[235:59.85]I don't know, man.
[236:01.49]Feels like the game has changed.
[236:03.59]Used to be a brotherhood.
[236:04.85]There was a code.
[236:06.25]Even amongst rival triads.
[236:09.00]Now we're killing each other at weddings.
[236:11.26]Even in a fucking hospital.
[236:13.28]And for what?
[236:14.70]Money.
[236:15.96]Money.
[236:16.30]The answer you're looking for there.
[236:17.50]Shit.
[236:17.98]A lot of it.
[236:18.72]Let's get out of here.
[236:25.19]Escape the cops.
[236:30.79]This is new music.
[236:36.16]What's up with this new camera?
[236:56.51]I like this strategy.
[236:58.46]Oh, what's that?
[236:59.00]Nobody was prepared.
[236:59.84]What the fuck are you doing?
[237:03.34]What do you mean, what the fuck am I doing?
[237:04.36]I'm getting away.
[237:04.98]Oh, no, I'm not.
[237:05.54]I'm just spawning in front of them.
[237:21.87]Damn it.
[237:22.75]That almost worked.
[237:34.49]See you later, Ricky.
[237:35.71]It's been fun shooting things with you.
[237:37.79]Back to the scene of the crime.
[237:40.54]Here we go.
[237:48.20]Turns out driving directly into the police is a bad idea.
[237:50.55]I got away.
[237:51.13]Pretty good time.
[237:52.83]Should level us up, or get close to it.
[237:55.51]Not quite.
[238:19.82]Sorry, I doubted you.
[238:23.57]How much money do I got?
[238:24.27]I need to make money.
[238:26.93]This is just a better car, so I'm gonna take it.
[238:40.39]Is this the... the... the Bellissimo?
[238:43.49]Whatever it is, the Bellissimo?
[238:44.63]Glossado?
[238:51.13]New outfit.
[238:51.75]Yeah, that's a good idea.
[238:54.65]Let's get the new one.
[238:55.24]Let's do a new outfit.
[238:56.86]I'm going to say I want to get the Just Cause one.
[238:58.34]Let's see what else there is available.
[239:02.54]This is far away, though.
[239:07.86]This is very far away.
[239:08.62]I'm going to have to get in a cab for this one.
[239:19.15]You see a cab, scream.
[239:31.48]Thank you for screaming.
[239:32.14]Appreciate it.
[239:46.81]Hold Y. Hold Y. Hold Y. Hold Y. Speaking of holding Y, what's wrong?
[239:53.99]I've lost control.
[239:55.75]And why is that?
[240:01.97]Oh, hi.
[240:02.79]Yep.
[240:04.83]You gonna let me play the game?
[240:06.69]Thanks.
[240:12.23]Somebody just linked my Ethereum?
[240:15.61]I still have to delete that.
[240:18.51]It was an experiment.
[240:22.27]Let's see.
[240:22.79]Preset outfits.
[240:24.80]Tactical... Assault rifle with grenade launcher.
[240:33.77]That sounds so good.
[240:35.67]What the fuck, man?
[240:37.43]What are you doing?
[240:44.86]Jesus.
[240:45.30]Alright, this is... Revolver with grenade launcher.
[240:48.20]Action hijack vehicles at a greater distance.
[240:50.46]I'm gonna do this.
[240:56.69]I'm doing it.
[240:57.85]I wanna see how this... Did we get a grenade launcher?
[240:59.59]Give it a try.
[241:04.57]Press R to toggle between grenades and bullets.
[241:09.13]Well, this looks fun.
[241:09.89]Alright, so I got a grappling hook too.
[241:13.02]I can only use it to cars.
[241:14.88]Did that?
[241:40.05]Why am I in a different costume?
[241:46.24]What the fuck?
[241:49.10]I gotta pee.
[241:50.58]I'll be back in a minute.
[241:51.44]I'm gonna take a piss.
[241:52.78]Be right back.
[244:14.82]I'm back.
[244:17.48]Let's get this shit show on the road.
[244:19.12]What do you say?
[244:27.63]Alright.
[244:38.27]Oh, by the way.
[244:40.40]I just want to give myself a little bit of credit here just because I want to, you know, here's my attorney defending me.
[244:46.89]Most of the time when I've pressed the pause button, see the two things that are grayed out that I haven't really been even looking at and paying attention to because they're not, they're grayed out and I haven't even, why would I even pay attention to grayed out shit?
[244:59.53]That's, you know, one of the reasons why I didn't see it in the first place.
[245:03.60]So, I mean, come on.
[245:06.26]Come on, give me some credit.
[245:07.82]Come on.
[245:09.95]Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi! Taxi!
[245:14.95]I wish there was a call taxi button.
[245:16.95]Alright. Good. Somebody died in the street. That means the taxi can stop.
[245:23.95]Oh we're- we're already here.
[245:30.95]Sorry to bother you sir.
[245:36.95]Where is it? Down here? That would've been a $300 cab ride.
[245:46.17]The grenade launcher does not explode on impact as we just figured out.
[245:56.17]Do they get out and... Okay, I need to see this.
[245:58.33]I want to examine the world.
[246:00.53]Do they actually get out like in GTA and help people?
[246:08.98]Do they get back up?
[246:17.41]Do they body bag him?
[246:19.27]Zip him up?
[246:20.05]What do they do?
[246:23.23]This job sucks.
[246:26.60]Hey!
[246:27.46]Slow down.
[246:44.69]That guy broke his leg.
[246:46.87]Look at him run away.
[246:47.81]Look at that.
[246:49.97]Oh, my God.
[246:54.95]No, I don't want to lose the cops.
[246:57.43]This job sucks.
[246:59.07]Can I put him in somebody else's trunk?
[247:00.43]Alright, take him away, quick.
[247:04.33]Get him out of here.
[247:06.31]Nobody in that car.
[247:08.57]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[247:11.81]No.
[247:13.09]No, get off me.
[247:15.04]Get off me!
[247:16.97]Cancel mission!
[247:19.79]Cancel!
[247:24.99]Oh, fuck you.
[247:34.04]That didn't even do anything.
[247:36.76]I watched a guy get hit by a bus and then I tackled him.
[247:41.37]Is that really that big of a deal?
[247:49.62]Wait a minute.
[247:51.00]Somebody made a really good point right here.
[247:52.74]Give me a police car.
[247:58.98]Where's just the standard shit police car?
[248:00.80]Let me see if you see it.
[248:06.24]Get pump shotgun.
[248:09.03]Don't mind if I do.
[248:11.91]Thanks.
[248:19.73]What?
[248:20.63]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[248:21.95]Don't... I don't have a gun.
[248:26.85]I'd like a... I'd like my motorcycle.
[248:29.99]See?
[248:30.43]See, he thinks it's funny.
[248:32.23]No harm.
[248:47.12]I still have the weapon, right?
[248:48.80]Yes, I do.
[248:51.38]Now we need to just go back to where we were.
[248:56.26]Just go here and buy the other outfit.
[248:59.38]The game wants me to go to bed.
[249:00.56]Not until we get in the Just Cause outfit.
[249:09.11]Then I'll go to bed.
[249:10.15]I'll have a new weapon to play with.
[249:18.50]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[249:26.84]Oh, right.
[249:32.88]Howdy.
[249:34.02]Alright, let's get it.
[249:38.82]Rico Rodriguez.
[249:40.62]I'm not even going to tell... The shotgun.
[249:42.02]I got that one in from America.
[249:44.30]I don't even want the shotgun.
[249:45.52]I have this insane weapon.
[249:47.30]It's gonna be fun.
[249:51.34]Alright.
[249:52.58]Go to bed.
[249:55.43]You got it.
[249:55.85]Move, please.
[250:03.53]I don't want to hurt anybody.
[250:08.71]Can I shoot the pistol?
[250:14.58]I can't.
[250:15.72]Oh, that's too bad.
[250:18.08]I can't shoot the grenade launcher part of this.
[250:19.74]That's kind of sad.
[250:30.29]Hello.
[250:33.07]Max speed.
[250:33.99]Achieved.
[250:42.05]Go to bed or you're grounded.
[250:46.12]What's going on over here?
[250:46.96]A random happening?
[250:48.80]Alright, I'm gonna check out the random happening.
[250:56.73]Something right here.
[251:00.99]Don't know what it is.
[251:03.16]Chase the thief.
[251:03.84]Don't you fuckers ever learn?
[251:25.90]Alright.
[251:28.20]We did it.
[251:32.64]Time to go back to bed.
[251:33.56]I need to go to the apartment.
[251:39.67]Which apartment do I want to go to, though?
[251:40.81]You know.
[251:43.69]I have a few houses now, don't I?
[251:55.03]Why are they not showing up on the minimap?
[252:01.61]Hey, um, excuse me.
[252:05.55]No, what the fuck is going on?
[252:08.80]Why are the houses not showing up?
[252:09.98]I have, like, three.
[252:12.28]There's one, like, right here.
[252:13.14]Right here.
[252:13.86]What?
[252:14.38]I can't just... That's not on the minimap?
[252:19.16]Does it have a gun out?
[252:19.92]What's your problem?
[252:21.74]Oh, okay.
[252:22.34]I just... Whatever.
[252:31.08]Go to bed.
[252:31.60]I have to try something.
[252:37.22]The two ladies that are always outside the apartment.
[252:38.82]We're going to try to do a ricochet kill on these two.
[252:45.65]So bounce it off the sign here in the corner and it should come back and hit them.
[252:54.19]No, it didn't do anything actually.
[252:55.57]Just coughing.
[253:17.40]That was me screaming.
[253:19.28]Why was I screaming?
[253:24.02]Whatever.
[253:24.68]That was very traumatizing for me.
[253:32.85]I'm gonna have a drink.
[253:35.21]Just gonna chill with a cider.
[253:36.39]It's all good.
[253:41.90]Oh, I stepped in the fire, right.
[253:47.08]Ready to step in the big game.
[253:48.18]Got a celebrity gig for you.
[253:49.32]Meet at Sonny Wu's.
[253:54.56]Important visitor.
[253:55.32]Another car mission.
[253:59.92]Let's go do the main story.
[254:01.78]I'm gonna change outfits so I have full grenade launcher, though.
[254:11.71]Do I get anything with the doctor uniform?
[254:16.58]No, not really.
[254:17.32]Increase damage in melee combat.
[254:23.85]Nope.
[254:24.09]Let's see if there's anything else.
[254:30.97]Whoa, whoa.
[254:31.39]Hey, buddy.
[254:31.89]What's going on here?
[254:33.13]Why do I have...
[254:42.77]That's because I never, okay, I get it.
[254:44.17]I never like changed out of it.
[254:45.61]You have to come out of the menu.
[254:46.61]You actually have to put on a pair of clothes and like get out of the menu.
[254:51.95]Like this.
[254:57.98]Doesn't matter if you just, uh... Where's the last one?
[255:05.60]Where's the couch?
[255:08.13]Yeah.
[255:09.37]Where's my couch?
[255:14.50]That thing was 10 grand.
[255:15.74]No, it was $14,000 actually.
[255:17.58]Different house?
[255:21.72]I think it's a different house.
[255:23.06]That's probably what it is.
[255:26.66]May have just gotten scammed, that's true.
[255:29.94]Alright, fast.
[255:33.20]Let's go to the mission.
[255:37.18]Give me my super 1100.
[255:45.66]I haven't even pushed this thing to the absolute limit yet.
[255:49.56]I'd like to.
[255:55.01]On the move.
[255:55.35]Let's go.
[255:58.59]God damn it.
[255:59.11]I'm reading chat.
[256:04.11]I'm going to be real.
[256:05.93]Let this be a lesson to all of you.
[256:08.40]Let this be a real lesson.
[256:10.87]If you take your eyes off the road for even a second, and you're going 150 miles per hour, you're gonna crash.
[256:18.84]Don't take your eyes off the road.
[256:20.62]Don't text anybody while you're driving.
[256:22.76]Don't look at... Don't open up your phone and open up Twitter.
[256:26.12]Yeah, like a red light.
[256:27.06]Just put the damn phone down.
[256:28.27]You know what I mean?
[256:29.17]Put it down.
[256:29.57]There's no reason for you to be on the phone.
[256:42.72]Especially if you're on a motorcycle going 180 miles per hour.
[256:46.26]Don't do that.
[256:51.44]High speed run.
[256:52.00]Top speed.
[256:54.34]Let's go.
[256:57.20]Oh, that's right.
[256:57.62]I do have this.
[256:58.16]So what does this do for me?
[257:05.30]Doesn't really do much.
[257:13.31]I'm not getting off because he's going the right way.
[257:16.25]It would be a mistake.
[257:18.19]He's going... Actually, he's going faster than the bike was.
[257:20.61]So I'm just gonna chill.
[257:28.16]Oh!
[257:40.58]I didn't let go.
[257:42.14]I guess there's a maximum amount of time you're allowed to stay on.
[257:44.83]Let's move.
[257:50.43]There's my helmet.
[257:52.03]Bye, helmet.
[257:56.23]I don't know how I survived that.
[258:00.50]I did get run over by a truck.
[258:03.82]Was it a truck?
[258:04.38]Oh, I don't know.
[258:05.26]I have my helmet on.
[258:11.04]Well, that's cool.
[258:13.42]I'm... I want to do that to somebody.
[258:15.60]Is that because I'm a just cause man now?
[258:21.54]That has to be because I'm a just cause man, right?
[258:23.13]Come on.
[258:29.71]We're science.
[258:39.25]I just was testing my new move.
[258:57.27]You always have that ability.

[259:12.17]Shoot car with action cam and see the magic.
[259:15.85]I'm sure it'd be fun and all, but that's not why I'm here.
[259:17.97]Sounds like a plan to me.
[259:19.44]You don't know what you're missing.
[259:20.90]This baby will fuck you in the way your wife does.
[259:23.76]Does a hundred times more damage to your own car?
[259:26.18]So just out of curiosity, how much is left in the game?

[260:26.15]I'm going to see what people are saying.

[261:25.18]That's not, that's not Lee, is it?
[261:28.64]It's not the same actor who plays Lee.
[261:31.90]Might be.
[261:34.81]From Walking Dead.
[261:36.65]He's got a great voice.
[261:39.43]He's got a real good smooth voice.

[261:48.13]That's cool.

[262:12.52]Are we singing karaoke?
[262:15.96]I thought that was a pool that people were standing in.
[262:19.52]Statue!
[262:20.06]Ooh, that's my fucking statue.
[262:21.57]Give it to me.
[262:22.61]Alright, find some girls to party with.
[262:24.27]Got it.
[262:34.30]Alright.
[262:35.38]Looks like we have one girl over here that we're gonna party with tonight.
[262:39.87]Forget about all the people that are over here, all the girls, all the boys, whatever.
[262:44.49]Forget about that.
[262:45.20]It's this one.
[262:46.42]This is the one.
[262:49.88]Hey there, what's your name?
[262:53.54]Patushka.
[262:54.31]I'm Wade.
[262:54.99]Listen, I saw you looking at my friend and I figured you realize he's a famous American celebrity.
[263:03.07]And I just wanted to ask if you mind keeping him in the cinema.
[263:07.25]How can I say no?
[263:09.27]If you're not doing anything, maybe I can buy you silence with a drink.
[263:13.26]She's from Russia.
[263:14.14]Where are we going?
[263:14.82]Back here?
[263:15.36]Alright, in here.
[263:16.14]That's like creepy.
[263:40.27]Yes, I've brought you a friend.
[263:43.88]He's just sitting in the middle of the couch like a fucking weirdo.
[263:47.84]What, I have to bring just women to this guy?
[263:50.34]This is like weird.
[263:52.51]Yes, I would require one to sit to my right as well.
[263:57.21]Okay.
[263:59.57]What's wrong with this guy?
[264:00.21]Why can't he go out here and do his own legwork?
[264:02.73]That's not how it works.
[264:03.65]Wingman?
[264:04.01]I'm not a wingman.
[264:04.75]I am a deliverer of people.
[264:06.75]Wingman means you're on the wing of the plane.
[264:09.07]Somebody has to fly the plane.
[264:10.65]I'm the pilot of the plane.
[264:11.71]I'm the wingman.
[264:12.25]He's just sitting on the plane.
[264:33.37]Oh this is like his girlfriend or something?
[264:47.67]I thought I could just slap him.
[264:52.71]This music is very loud.
[264:55.79]Turn it down.
[264:57.95]Just like every other bar or club I've ever fucking been to in my life.
[265:04.21]Can't wait to have you lean in and point your ear at me while I yell in your fucking ear.
[265:11.93]Doesn't everybody love that shit?
[265:14.42]Go to a bar and there's like some loud-ass music.
[265:17.22]And you have to lean in- Oh, what?
[265:19.46]Let me turn my head towards you and point my ear into your mouth so I can hear the fucking thing you're trying to tell me.
[265:26.56]Why do they do that shit?
[265:29.68]Turn the music down like 40%.
[265:31.62]Nobody's listening to the fucking music anyways.
[265:33.25]They want to talk.
[265:34.11]You want to have a conversation with people.
[265:40.37]And that's how you get your face spit in hundreds of times over the course of an evening.
[265:45.90]I've been to my fair share of parties and you actually have to take your hand and windshield wipe, smear down your face every 20 minutes.
[265:55.00]Because somebody has to get really close to talk to you and they spit inside your ear and all over your cheek and your face and in your mouth and then you have that panic attack where you're like:
[266:03.00]Oh, okay, this person just spit into my mouth and I have to talk to them still because obviously we're all here to have fun and hang out and they don't know that they spit directly into my mouth so I have to keep it together...
[266:17.26]while I internally die.
[266:22.32]And then you go to the bathroom and you like rinse your mouth after like fucking 30 minutes of talking to the same person.
[266:26.24]Who knew Hong Kong was full of such beautiful women?
[266:31.73]Friendly too.
[266:32.85]How do you not know Hong Kong have beautiful girls?
[266:36.09]You just had to come to the right place.
[266:40.08]This is real.
[266:40.66]I'm not making a joke.
[266:42.16]This is real.
[266:42.92]This happens all the time.
[266:48.36]They'll talk, especially when people get drunk, and they start to get sloppy, and even more spit hits you right in your lips.
[266:56.96]And you can't freak out, because if you freak out, you're like, oh, fuck, man, you're spitting in my mouth.
[267:01.90]What if you don't know these people?
[267:03.83]Right?
[267:03.99]What if you don't really know them that well?
[267:05.29]They're like an acquaintance, a friend of a friend.
[267:06.91]You can't freak out.
[267:10.75]Let me close the door.
[267:13.43]Can't.
[267:17.49]Alright, what are we gonna do?
[267:19.43]Hit me with your best shot.
[267:21.33]Bad case of loving you.
[267:22.37]This one?
[267:23.53]I guess we're gonna do this one.
[267:24.99]Hit me with your best shot.
[267:44.05]Fire away.
[267:45.87]It's not this song.
[267:47.39]Here we go.
[267:51.25]Have to be in the green.
[267:52.01]Get out of here!
[267:58.27]Private room!
[268:01.56]Private fucking room.
[268:02.46]Alright, is this a...
[268:24.95]Pretty realistic karaoke.
[268:30.17]Okay, I wanna be good.

[268:47.29]You could live the most cushy, great life.
[268:49.97]Just sing beautiful songs for people.
[268:51.85]You could be a career musician.
[268:56.03]If you're this good.
[268:56.81]I need a long note to hold.
[269:12.39]So I can freak out.

[270:25.08]We're not gonna go for the low-hanging fruit.
[270:40.88]Here's the end of the movie.
[270:58.17]Hold on.
[270:58.99]I had it.
[270:59.31]We're taking pictures of other guests.
[271:03.79]I didn't take that.
[271:10.56]The end of this.
[271:11.48]That was the series finale of this TV show.
[271:14.90]It's not coming back.
[271:15.68]It's over.
[271:16.16]That's the end.

[271:35.45]Where's my gun?
[271:37.61]Alright, so he, is he like a, what is he, a fighter?

[272:07.74]Give me your weapon.
[272:14.04]Bang, bang, bang, bang.
[272:15.44]Oof.

[272:41.84]Take King back.
[272:42.98]No, that wasn't Sonny.
[272:43.98]Why did I say Sonny?
[272:47.33]Is his name Sonny?
[272:53.35]No wonder he's driving on the right side of the road.
[272:56.83]I had to go this way, though.
[272:59.25]I'm talking all the legit shit their money goes into gotta go somewhere.
[273:04.07]You feel me?
[273:04.83]When the feds back home are really cracking down, the brothers might be looking for a little offshore stash.

[274:53.93]That's dumb.
[274:56.59]You call one, you call a day.
[274:59.45]The next, like, night.
[275:00.47]Like, one night or two.
[275:01.57]If it's the same weekend, maybe see what they're doing on Sunday or Saturday.
[275:05.33]The whole three days bullshit?
[275:08.05]No.
[275:08.81]Don't listen to that horse shit.
[275:15.31]You gotta wait like seven days before you call the girl so they forget who you were in the first place.
[275:25.05]And then it's really awkward.
[275:28.72]Where?
[275:29.08]I went to the... No one's heard.
[275:36.30]Where is this?
[275:36.90]Why?
[275:37.30]Give me the bar!
[275:42.39]Call right after you get the number.
[275:47.05]This is too soon.
[275:47.95]What I'm doing here is way too soon.
[275:50.09]But, that don't matter.
[275:53.25]One day.
[275:54.29]Call in front of them.
[276:12.03]Follow me.
[276:12.86]Let's see if you can keep up.
[276:14.02]Yeah, you make a dumb joke.
[276:15.42]You know, you get the phone number and... Oh my god.
[276:18.16]She's an alien.
[276:24.58]Ah!
[276:26.78]Like, after her... No.
[276:33.01]Beat me at free running.
[276:35.53]This is not a good date.
[276:37.75]I don't like this date.
[276:38.81]We couldn't just go to a fucking movie?
[276:42.03]Oh, I went the wrong way.
[276:44.45]I don't know where we're supposed to be going.
[276:52.82]Hey, it says beat or free run.
[276:53.90]That's all I heard.
[276:54.90]Hit the wrong button.
[277:11.00]I win.
[277:11.26]Wow.
[277:17.99]Shove her to the ground.
[277:18.77]I can't really run.
[277:19.95]I tried.
[277:20.77]Shoot her.
[277:22.79]Yeah, me too.
[277:23.65]She's letting you win.
[277:25.82]Yes.
[277:31.55]What else do you do for fun?
[277:33.57]Are you coming on too?
[277:34.49]I think you left the sweater in the dryer a little too long.
[277:37.49]Is that okay?
[277:38.27]Yes, it's fine.
[277:39.13]I like it.
[277:42.73]Wait, let me show you something.
[277:47.53]I've been thinking about this for a while.
[277:50.93]Let's do it.
[277:55.68]So what is the point of doing all these?
[277:59.57]Okay, that's what I did.
[278:00.45]Lockbox.
[278:01.24]Cases now appear in the mini-mill.
[278:03.64]Uh, thanks.
[278:04.22]I love how having sex on a roof gave me intuitive superpowers.
[278:22.95]You showed her you- I'm not even gonna say it.
[278:25.35]You're not gonna bait me into saying what you just wrote.
[278:33.65]We've picked up a lot of random, I'm gonna say in quotes, gear.
[278:38.35]You know?
[278:41.49]Might be worth going to a clothing shop and seeing what we have.
[278:45.41]Or, my own wardrobe.
[278:55.02]Streamer doesn't know about sex powers?
[279:01.10]Um...
[279:04.81]Excuse me.
[279:08.11]Excuse me.
[279:17.57]Where's this person?
[279:19.41]I would love to help you.
[279:20.41]Can you help me?
[279:21.17]How do I get out of this trap I'm in?
[279:28.79]We can talk to each other through the wall.
[279:30.31]How do I get over there?
[279:35.38]You are excused.
[279:38.44]Actually, when did I first call Kim?
[279:40.80]I'm gonna ask her this after the stream.
[279:44.25]I think she's asleep.
[279:46.97]I'm gonna wake her up and be like, Kim, when did I first call you when we started seeing each other?
[279:50.65]She's probably gonna tell me, like, she's probably gonna be like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[279:58.67]I really am stuck here.
[280:01.83]I was gonna use the grenade.
[280:07.82]I think I have to go backwards from here.
[280:09.78]There's no way to get up there.
[280:12.22]Secret hidden place?
[280:13.92]No.
[280:14.42]I gotta go all the way... Did the door?
[280:15.76]What do you mean door?
[280:18.00]What door?
[280:19.50]That's not a door.
[280:21.16]Go through the door you came through.
[280:26.26]What the fuck is this door?
[280:27.68]I didn't go through this door.
[280:32.46]I didn't come through this door.
[280:33.84]This is the back entrance to the club.
[280:38.00]I never went in this door.
[280:39.69]Didn't go in that door.
[280:43.25]I didn't go in that door.
[280:44.21]Give me a full body massage, I need it.
[280:47.51]Sorry, I keep making references to this fucking show.
[281:07.34]come again soon thanks
[281:17.16]What does this stick on?
[281:21.99]Coffee, table, and rug.
[281:23.13]Everyone sells me fake merchandise.
[281:24.65]I'm just gonna buy it.
[281:25.37]They'll be able to treat me to get all the fake merchandise.
[281:28.27]No, I didn't pay you for that.
[281:29.69]Who's this dude?
[281:30.55]No, I don't...
[281:47.71]Convince her that real men can't sing.
[281:50.31]Whoa, whoa, easy!
[281:51.59]Psycho!
[281:56.89]He just did one of his loops.
[281:58.45]One of his animation loops.
[282:00.46]Was not done in the right place.
[282:02.06]He just smashed.
[282:05.12]Wow, this guy's a psycho.
[282:07.30]I'm gonna score really high now.
[282:10.02]Just to show him up in front of his girlfriend.
[282:12.33]Oh, is this your girlfriend?
[282:13.15]Uh, yeah.
[282:13.69]Guys, guys, I can't sing karaoke.
[282:17.18]This is what you deserve, you fucking degenerate.
[282:33.52]Oh yeah, look at him facing down, his eyes at the floor.
[282:38.81]Let's embarrass this guy in front of his girlfriend.
[282:50.51]Right now he's having a panic attack.
[282:53.01]What is he doing?
[282:53.75]What is he doing?
[282:54.67]I don't understand why I told him to be bad.
[282:56.87]Oh, and this is not good.
[283:03.04]Oh, he's going to get her phone number, I think.
[283:04.44]This is not good.
[283:07.44]Oh.
[283:10.24]He's so good.
[283:10.96]Oh.
[283:21.10]Couldn't get away.
[283:24.61]Guitar solo.
[283:28.21]Yes, it's working!
[283:28.83]This is exactly what I wanted.
[283:30.77]He looks so fucking stupid right now.
[283:32.19]Good, keep doing that.
[283:35.38]Yes.
[283:36.40]Exactly what I wanted.
[283:37.34]Please keep doing that.
[283:40.76]You look so awful.
[283:43.79]No, no, no, no, no.
[283:44.43]Don't go back to singing.
[283:45.41]Please.
[283:51.64]He's standing up now.
[283:52.52]The anger on his face.
[284:00.52]He went from sad to standing.
[284:06.39]I'm gonna get punched in the back of the head.
[284:15.06]Please come hit me.
[284:18.26]Please come hit me so I can bury your head into the machine.
[284:27.50]Activate the star power.
[284:29.07]Unplug his mic.
[284:30.37]See, I'm so good, I'm even bringing in other ladies.
[284:36.21]Alright, you got a problem?
[284:40.26]Let's see. 94%.
[284:56.96]Favor failed.
[284:57.72]You did... Favor failed or... Mission complete.
[285:12.55]No, she'll never sleep with me now.
[285:16.15]That's what you get for smashing a glass at the bar.
[285:19.96]You dick.
[285:31.70]Chad.
[285:34.51]Alright, let's move to... Uh, Jade Statue.

[286:16.88]Oh, I'm... Got on the green.
[286:26.48]The green, I'm... I thought I was being smart and avoiding and going up to the green, because the green, not the right green, it was a different green.
[286:36.48]So now I'm gonna get a taxi.
[286:39.68]Find a taxi.
[286:40.90]Make sure when you, what's the magic word when you find a taxi, make sure you scream.
[286:49.64]Makes a lot.
[286:58.78]No!
[287:19.55]No, I want to put him in the trunk!
[287:22.95]God damn it!
[287:27.92]Never mind, never mind, never mind.
[287:29.52]I was gonna throw him in the trunk.
[287:34.52]What was that?
[287:35.32]You hear that?
[287:38.64]Oh, that's the brawl over here, whatever.
[287:43.62]Human delivery.
[287:46.13]I found one of your statues.
[287:48.13]The rooster.
[287:49.49]Good, good.
[287:49.99]Thank you for the statue.
[287:51.73]It seems as though they're all finding their way back to me.
[287:56.41]Perhaps that was their destiny from the start.
[287:59.08]What does that make me?
[288:00.60]Oh, I have no doubt you'll return to Hong Kong.
[288:03.14]What would you like to learn?
[288:05.44]So we've got one final move here.
[288:09.08]This is a double jump kick.
[288:11.26]A follow-up combo from the regular jump kick.
[288:18.92]Stun, grapple, arm break.
[288:20.50]Ooh.
[288:21.42]Let's just get this.
[288:23.12]Just to have everything on the top row.
[288:24.44]So how does this one work?
[288:27.18]From a grab?
[288:28.10]Sprint?
[288:29.28]And then... Oh, that's great.
[288:36.57]That works.
[288:44.71]This move is so good.
[288:46.13]No wonder it's all the way down here.
[288:52.79]That's the fastest I've ever done that.
[288:54.09]Double jump.
[289:05.28]So, that puts us... Fast girls.
[289:13.89]Let's go.
[289:14.95]Oh, no, we need a taxi.
[289:21.16]Taxi!
[289:22.48]Take me to Fast Girls, please!
[289:29.04]You even saw me hold it.
[289:38.99]You watched me hold it.
[289:41.39]You saw the bar fill up.
[289:56.08]You saw the bar, Phil.
[289:59.78]Run that clip back and watch it.
[290:07.10]Alright, let's do it.
[290:10.01]Back to central.
[290:11.79]New mission.
[290:13.95]I don't mind you fucking her.
[290:16.11]It's one of the perks.
[290:17.61]But she has to understand the consequences if she disappoints me.
[290:21.36]Are we clear?
[290:22.10]Of course, Sonny.
[290:23.60]You're not getting attached, are you?
[290:25.20]A man of your caliber?
[290:27.58]You don't need to worry about that.
[290:29.28]I hope not.
[290:31.32]Excuse me.
[290:31.98]Excuse me, buddy.
[290:32.58]No.
[290:32.66]From my personal experience...
[290:55.25]The ones that talk the most about things like this usually are the ones that do it the least.
[291:03.09]Then I went back, and man, you don't even know how awesome it was.
[291:08.43]She called all of her friends and told them how great it... No, that didn't happen.
[291:11.79]No, it didn't.
[291:12.11]That didn't happen.
[291:20.35]I understand you've had a few drinks and you're trying to seem more interesting to the table, but it's not.
[291:25.32]It's not interesting at all, actually.
[291:50.54]You know, back in the day, you would just nod at those people.
[291:54.18]And be like, yeah.
[291:55.84]Yeah.
[291:57.26]Okay.
[291:58.28]Yeah.
[291:59.64]Sure.
[292:00.20]Okay.
[292:01.22]Right.
[292:13.19]Who are you?
[292:13.75]I'm Wei.
[292:14.99]Ricky sent me.
[292:16.03]Didn't he tell you?
[292:17.03]No, I was expecting Ricky.
[292:19.31]Everything okay?
[292:20.67]Everything is not okay.
[292:22.83]Is it wrong of me to want to see my boyfriend?
[292:24.58]Why do I have to put up with this?
[292:26.14]No, Vivi, it's not wrong.
[292:28.12]And you put up with it because Ricky loves you.
[292:31.42]But... But what?
[292:33.56]Since your boyfriend isn't driving, I get to sit in front.
[292:39.43]Why are the bad ones always so good?
[292:40.97]Twitches my shower thoughts?
[292:43.30]Yeah, so what?
[292:44.66]No seatbelts.
[292:45.28]Put your seatbelts on.
[293:16.03]So what's the deal, Wade?
[293:17.05]Are you a gangster like Ricky?
[293:25.67]Wait, how do I do the thing?
[293:26.65]How do I do the thing?
[293:27.27]Let's say I'm as much of a gangster as Ricky.
[293:30.00]They can't hear me.
[293:31.36]That's too bad.
[293:32.62]Recently, I've wanted to date a gangster.
[293:34.72]Well, maybe I'll see if I can find one for you.
[293:36.94]That would be nice.
[293:39.38]What's Ricky doing anyways?
[293:40.92]Why is he too...
[293:42.44]I don't know.
[293:43.44]Something with Sonny.
[293:44.75]Sonny?
[293:45.17]He's doing something.
[293:45.81]That guy's a creep and a perv.
[293:47.95]Sorry, Vivi.
[293:48.85]It's okay.
[293:49.49]Why?
[293:50.15]What'd he do?
[293:51.13]Nothing.
[293:52.03]But he tried.
[293:52.83]I was at a party on Wallace Chung's yacht.
[293:55.80]I was like, 16.
[293:58.68]I got so high.
[294:01.06]Come on.
[294:02.22]Come on.
[294:24.39]Come on, keep the conversation going so I can die in the middle of it.
[294:27.05]Somebody fucking hit me with your car.
[294:28.89]I'm a bad person.
[294:29.57]Fucking hit me with your car.
[294:31.49]Sure.
[294:59.33]Yeah.
[295:10.93]Alright, fine.
[295:33.96]Silent now for the remainder of the ride.
[295:40.95]Fucking Jerm of Pluto, for real.
[295:52.53]Pluto.
[295:53.93]That would have been a lot of fun.
[295:56.96]I would have been dead with my mouth moving in the middle of a conversation.
[296:03.26]What?
[296:03.46]What?
[296:03.70]What is this?
[296:30.64]We race for the girls and... What?
[296:32.76]Wait, they don't get a say in this?
[296:35.00]You racing with the girls in your car?
[296:37.77]Alright.
[296:38.29]Okay.
[296:40.25]Think of it as your head start, Alex.
[296:42.47]Because you're going to need it.
[296:45.73]Well, alright.
[296:48.92]Are you guys okay with this?
[296:50.08]You guys cool with that?
[296:52.44]I mean, I just put you up for auction, essentially.
[296:54.54]Like, you're cool with that, right?
[296:57.61]It's gonna get my juices going.
[296:59.38]Sorry.
[296:59.64]All the material.
[297:00.44]That car is awesome.
[297:08.46]I want it.
[297:08.74]How can I commandeer it?
[297:43.07]Excuse me.
[297:45.01]Good places to be.
[297:45.79]I got somewhere over the rainbow, you know what I mean?
[298:12.13]See, I'm the one that's taking slow... I'm being slowed down.
[298:14.95]I have to go through the fucking roadblock.
[298:17.31]So I lose speed.
[298:18.83]Not fair.
[298:19.21]I want to be in second place so I can cross the guy when he goes over the roadblock.
[298:31.65]That's a ding.
[298:34.05]I just lost him!
[298:34.71]What?
[298:34.97]Hey!
[298:35.29]That's not fair.
[298:36.77]I just fucking lost the cops and they come right back.
[298:46.69]Dang it.
[298:48.89]I'm so far ahead of the competition.
[298:50.29]I don't even care about the police officer.
[298:56.34]It's alright.
[298:56.68]I'm so far ahead.
[299:00.40]It'll take you a million years to catch me.
[299:03.62]I'm so far ahead.
[299:04.36]It'll take you 10,000 years to catch me.
[299:11.38]There it is.
[299:22.03]Fuck, I was trying to hit that person.
[299:23.15]I just got away from them.
[299:25.51]Why would they be here?
[299:52.44]Oh, fuck!
[299:57.44]I'm alright, I'm fine.
[300:00.84]I'm fine, everything's fine.
[300:05.77]I got fucked with the wrong goddamn chat!
[300:15.81]Oh, man.
[300:19.65]That's some supernatural shit right there.
[300:34.61]Get off the side of the road I'm on.
[300:40.56]Oh, you lost him.
[300:41.60]Thank God.
[300:42.48]Nice work, Wei.
[300:44.38]That guy threw a bottle at me.
[300:46.30]And activated my fucking super power.
[300:48.41]Of course.
[300:49.27]Well, unless Sandra has some other exciting plan.
[300:52.27]I'm excited out.
[300:56.93]Mission accomplished.
[300:59.01]Wow, I just take you up on that.
[301:01.31]Oh, get a room, you two.
[301:03.02]I think that's a bit late.
[301:05.06]Oh, you are?
[301:06.62]Oh, that's it, just over there.
[301:08.16]Oh!
[301:13.50]That was fun.
[301:14.18]That was fun, Wei.
[301:19.98]Wait, there were groceries in the back?
[301:25.46]Vivi, give Wei my number.
[301:27.25]When do we get groceries?
[301:28.77]I don't remember going grocery shopping.
[301:32.29]Sandra says you can take her on a second date if you want.
[301:35.43]Yeah, I got that.
[301:37.27]Thanks.
[301:37.53]Thanks for taking us out today.
[301:39.05]It was my pleasure.
[301:46.44]I love this game.
[301:48.94]What a joy this has been to play.
[301:51.11]Seriously, this is great.
[301:56.25]$100,000 Kennedy Town apartment.
[301:59.06]I got Sandra's phone number.
[302:00.62]Guys, what's the first thing we do when we get a new girl's phone number?
[302:05.18]We call them immediately.
[302:18.28]What?
[302:18.48]Hold on, did I?
[302:18.92]Did I just get caught?
[302:19.50]Oh shit, this is John Tucker must die.
[302:22.64]They figured it out.
[302:51.52]Oh no.
[302:52.56]Oh no, what do I do?
[302:53.48]I saw how this movie ends.
[302:56.04]The girls are working together now.
[302:57.60]They figured out they're gonna fucking slit my throat and throw me in the water.
[303:06.85]I've had sex with too many women in too short amount of time.
[303:13.53]The way, I just like, oh my god.
[303:20.99]That's too many, that's too many funny things in two middle, you know?
[303:26.55]I gotta take a second here.
[303:29.13]When I smashed on the ground and everyone stopped talking.
[303:32.55]This used to be a bicentennial mainstream, I know.
[303:45.49]So whose mission are we on?
[303:46.63]I'm just gonna see what happens.
[304:02.25]I can't handle the stress.
[304:19.28]I fucking missed the exit.
[304:24.10]I keep thinking of them.
[304:28.61]I keep thinking of jumping off the fence.
[304:31.49]Like, silent!
[304:33.23]Oh my god.
[304:36.37]I missed my exit again.
[304:39.39]We have to go this way.
[304:44.58]Yeah, this game has a full-on recommend.
[304:55.55]Now, sometimes you talk about, oh, this game sucks.
[304:58.71]This is a full-on stamp recommend.
[305:03.39]For sure.
[305:05.56]I need to turn around.
[305:21.60]Let's get off here.
[305:28.55]I'm going on another date.
[305:39.11]What?
[305:39.49]What's going on here?
[305:40.15]No, I don't want to... Fuck your race.
[305:43.09]I don't want to... I don't want to... I don't want to join your race.
[305:48.29]Look at places to be.
[305:49.13]I have a double date to get caught on.
[305:51.15]Oh, shit.
[305:57.55]That was dangerous.
[306:00.55]Alright, where is she?
[306:01.67]Right here?
[306:09.88]Wait!
[306:11.02]Over here!
[306:13.22]So, uh, where do you wanna go?
[306:15.72]I don't care.
[306:17.04]As long as we get there fast.
[306:21.79]Are we gonna walk over her body?
[306:24.77]Don't do it.
[306:26.29]Come on, speed up a little.
[306:29.41]Drive fast to get Sandra excited.
[306:31.99]Is that as fast as you can go?
[306:34.49]You want fast?
[306:36.47]Maintain a high speed for 60 seconds.
[306:38.04]You're driving pretty slow.
[306:40.62]Wow, okay.
[306:41.76]Don't fuck with me here.
[306:43.86]Good, now let's go faster.
[306:48.58]I do realize I can't go 60.
[306:49.68]This car can go faster than this, right?
[306:53.11]Give me the highway.
[306:58.61]You want excitement?
[307:00.01]I can ghost ride you off a cliff.
[307:02.85]How's that for excitement?
[307:03.80]Yeah!
[307:04.04]Woo!
[307:04.54]I love it!
[307:05.48]What a thrill seeker she is.
[307:08.06]Faster!
[307:19.38]This girl's a psycho.
[307:20.22]This is what you wanted?
[307:24.55]You wanted me to drive you around really dangerously and then drop you off in front of your dad.
[307:50.62]What the fuck is wrong with this girl?
[307:53.75]Stop driving in the wrong... I can't help it!
[307:55.49]I'm from America!
[308:00.94]The land of the free and the home of the right side of the road.
[308:07.00]I can't help it sometimes.
[308:08.71]It's too much for me to understand.
[308:35.17]Fucking get out of my way, cars.
[308:39.89]Oh my god, the land of the free.
[308:42.75]And the home.
[308:46.55]Security system.
[308:48.93]ADT.
[308:50.93]Give us a call sometimes while your family's in danger.
[309:06.02]Stop crashing.
[309:07.14]There's no stopping crashing in these games.
[309:12.73]You ever played a Nintendo game before?
[309:14.13]It's not my fault I'm at the Hollywood Hills.
[309:24.35]And I'm in a very fast car.
[309:43.93]Alright, hi dad Here in my garage See you got all these books back here, but I don't really care about my car as much as my books man I read 12 books a day all 1200 pages Yes
[310:07.44]We're having sex in the car.
[310:08.84]We're having an encounter.
[310:09.82]In front of her dad.
[310:11.64]Oh no.
[310:11.80]Oh no, that's not how you... That's not how you make the phone call asking for the ring.
[310:32.78]Hey, Dad, I just want to ask you, I want to call you Dad from now on, but... Hang on, hold on.
[310:37.92]Come over here.
[310:40.36]Would you be okay with me taking her hand in marriage?
[310:44.66]You okay with that, Dad?
[310:51.46]Victoria Peak Races.
[311:02.26]This guy alright?
[311:02.80]What's wrong with this guy?
[311:05.97]Why is this guy hostile?
[311:06.81]What's wrong with you?
[311:10.05]This guy's shirt is undone.
[311:11.23]What's wrong with this guy?
[311:14.33]Alright, I'm gonna try... I'm gonna block him through here and see if I can pull him through the gate.
[311:25.42]I think it's gonna be possible from the right spot, maybe.
[311:27.20]It's the dad.
[311:32.22]Wow.
[311:33.32]You know what?
[311:33.72]You're right.
[311:36.30]Now it makes sense now.
[311:39.49]Okay, let me handle this, though.
[311:41.23]I gotta handle this.
[311:43.77]Yeah, let me handle this.
[311:48.99]Oh, come on.
[311:49.51]I can't handle this?
[311:51.29]Where's my gun?
[311:53.75]Where's my grenades?
[311:54.68]Where the fuck are my grenades?
[312:03.25]Get the fuck out of here, Dad.
[312:05.25]We love each other.
[312:06.21]Oh boy, I broke it.
[312:14.07]Get the fuck over here.
[312:16.93]I knew I'd get you.
[312:20.81]This is not... I killed Dad.
[312:26.01]Dad?
[312:26.85]Alright, Dad's dead.
[312:33.44]Sorry, Dad.
[312:36.50]Maybe in another life.
[312:39.80]This is far away, though.
[312:45.12]What's on the map?
[312:45.76]Hold on.
[312:48.86]Bad luck in a new case.
[312:50.38]Whoa, cops are here.
[312:51.24]Let's do bad luck.
[313:02.54]It's right down the street.
[313:07.72]I'm so thirsty.
[313:08.44]I gotta get another drink.
[313:09.40]Hold on.
[313:10.06]I'm gonna pause it right here.
[313:13.93]By the way, not gonna stop.
[313:15.53]I'm not gonna do anything.
[313:16.25]I'm gonna stand in the middle of the road.
[313:18.03]Fuck it, man.
[313:19.01]YOLO.
[313:19.49]YOLO.
[313:19.97]Watch.
[313:21.25]I'm right back.
[314:02.74]Yeah.
[316:17.51]And look at that.
[316:19.05]Not only am I still alive, I learned a few things along the way.
[316:23.73]Get off camera.
[316:36.07]Okay.
[316:38.51]Onward to right here.
[316:48.45]Hide your slug jupes.
[316:49.81]I like slug jupes.
[317:08.40]I hear that he is already planning to make it permanent, should Uncle Po not recover.
[317:14.01]Big Smiley will kill him before he'll let that happen.
[317:16.42]Indeed.
[317:17.56]And that would allow me to take over the Sanoyi himself.
[317:21.62]That can't happen.
[317:22.58]No, it cannot.
[317:24.68]Tuchin must go.
[317:26.74]But he must not be removed by force.
[317:29.47]I'm going to kill Tuchin.
[317:30.39]He must step down on his own, after which there will be an election.
[317:34.05]No, we've got to force a democracy.
[317:36.11]Tuchin likes heroin.
[317:38.69]So far, he has managed to control his habit.
[317:41.73]But anyone who indulges as he does lives permanently on the brink of an abyss.
[317:49.14]I've arranged for the quality of his supply to improve.
[317:52.72]And now you will give him a nudge.
[317:55.48]I can't drink.
[317:56.02]This is too hot, ma'am.
[317:57.10]Okay.
[317:58.06]How?
[317:59.52]He's an immensely superstitious man.
[318:02.37]Oh, my son.
[318:04.01]Obsessed with feng shui.
[318:06.19]He cannot bear to have the slightest thing out of place.
[318:08.55]He'll trash his apartment.
[318:11.77]And you want me to... Make sure his luck turns bad.
[318:16.86]Very bad.
[318:19.64]We gotta go be a pretend piece of superstition.
[318:29.72]Alright, get inside the crab car.
[318:31.84]Yeah, I'm gonna start with your shitbox.
[318:50.65]There, that looks better.
[318:52.83]Drive to the gated community.
[318:55.01]Give me the advice.
[318:56.49]Where's my advice?
[318:57.89]I don't.
[318:58.87]But I will rough this guy's house up nonetheless.
[319:23.35]Oh, gambling?
[319:23.93]How fast?
[319:24.73]Well, we found... We pulled... We pulled the guy out.
[319:29.53]Can this guy climb?
[319:30.55]What?
[319:55.84]Yeah, your husband's going to get tire ironed.
[320:08.15]You don't... Why wouldn't you come over here?
[320:10.53]You're just going to let us do this.
[320:13.87]Well, you deserve this then.
[320:15.21]You're going to let two strangers in your house without vetting them?
[320:19.52]Without taking a look at who the fuck they are?
[320:22.20]Where is this person?
[320:23.86]Did we ping their cell phone?
[320:26.85]God damn it.
[320:27.65]Nobody has any... Apparently people don't have any problem with security anymore.
[320:30.70]I was going to up-cart him over the fence, but... Fast talk.
[320:37.76]The fast talk mechanism is really kind of a dumb, lame mechanic.
[320:57.35]You guys feel that way as well?
[321:01.96]Let's just press Y. Like, for instance, do I even need to do that, or can I tire iron this guy in the head?
[321:08.46]Oh, well, that may... Fast talk.
[321:10.10]Ah!
[321:26.70]Oh, did he?
[321:29.18]We were caught.
[321:30.72]That's how that played out.
[321:33.10]That's how it happened?
[321:40.72]Yeah, are you sure he didn't catch the tire iron in the back of his skull?
[321:55.66]That was brutal.
[321:59.81]He caught you seconds before losing consciousness.
[322:02.53]Make sure you press Y. Why?
[322:05.17]No, I believe you.
[322:06.43]You pressed Y in five seconds.
[322:08.45]Should we get in this thing?
[322:09.53]It's sitting right here for us.
[322:10.47]No.
[322:27.53]I'm gonna follow him.
[322:28.05]I am... Oh, I figured it out.
[322:33.58]What's this guy's name?
[322:34.32]Alright, pick the lock.
[322:36.32]Watch, just give me some cover here.
[322:59.23]No, I want you to watch to make sure nobody comes over here.
[323:05.47]That's what I would like you to do.
[323:06.40]Where's my gun?
[323:25.98]Statue, don't mind if I do.
[323:27.08]Oh!
[323:27.26]I want the statue.
[323:28.36]Get in there.
[323:29.18]I can't get in here?
[323:30.34]I can't move this?
[323:32.71]I can't get in there.
[323:34.35]How do I get the statue that's inside of it?
[324:05.63]I can't acquire the statue until the doors are open.
[324:08.05]Oh, there it is.
[324:11.95]Fuck.
[324:12.13]Fuck!
[324:29.65]What are you doing?
[324:37.29]Give me that statue, please.
[324:38.19]Oh, clock.
[324:40.01]Clock, dude.
[324:40.49]Come on, man.
[324:41.01]Clock.
[324:41.93]Go to the clock.
[324:43.65]Okay.
[324:44.06]This feng shui is all fucked up.
[325:03.56]What are you doing?
[325:04.34]No, go back down here.
[325:06.34]You frog person.
[325:10.20]Just move the piano.
[325:16.62]Why can't he help me do this?
[325:21.54]You've got hands, man.
[325:24.06]I think we're done here.
[325:25.42]Or two.
[325:25.76]Either he thinks it goes fucking with him, or he knows his home is
[325:33.21]Alright.
[325:36.29]Police are ringing the door.
[325:38.81]Fast talk the piano.
[325:44.06]Hide.
[325:49.28]Take cover behind the couch.
[325:54.83]Take cover behind the couch!
[325:58.13]Oh, come on man, really?
[326:01.11]He stood up for no reason, I didn't even move.
[326:06.44]No, this cou- God!
[326:16.18]Take cover behind the couch!
[326:31.90]Hey, this didn't look like a couch from my view.
[326:36.58]This looked like another piano.
[326:39.45]Look it.
[326:39.87]Do you see a piano?
[326:40.99]I see a piano.
[326:43.01]What's that?
[326:43.35]Look at that.
[326:43.91]Look at that piano.
[326:44.57]Uh-oh.
[326:50.81]Uh-oh.
[327:00.11]Get the security camera, hack it, turn it off.
[327:03.17]You're a big fat guy, you sure are good at moving around.
[327:10.36]Two correct.
[327:11.78]Got the two and the six, and we just got it cracked, boys.
[327:29.66]Boys and girls, we just cracked the site.
[327:31.88]Yeah, just flash the bios.
[327:50.76]Those cards must have been rigged.
[327:54.22]Don't you feel like if you put a knife into his stomach, a bunch of blue jello would come out?
[328:02.23]This makes me want to go play cards.
[328:06.07]Look at this.
[328:18.27]Did he puke on his own shirt?
[328:19.65]He, like, spit all over his stomach.
[328:20.85]No, I don't play poker.
[328:22.55]Holy shit.
[328:23.01]You can move.
[328:23.53]Can we both fit in here?
[328:48.26]There's only two games I play at the casino.
[328:52.87]I can explain why.
[328:54.77]Baccarat and Blackjack.
[328:57.05]Because Baccarat is actually one of the safest games to play at the casino.
[329:02.06]And Blackjack, if you're good enough, you can reverse the house hit.
[329:09.33]Your best odds at the casino are a baccarat and blackjack.
[329:11.97]Don't play roulette.
[329:14.41]Or some craps.
[329:16.54]Craps is okay too.
[329:26.72]Blackjack is the most fun.
[329:30.76]As long as you don't bet like a psycho.
[329:34.04]Craps are probably the best odds, but you need to learn how to play craps, which is really not that difficult.
[329:46.19]Back around essentially is a coin flip.
[329:49.85]But it's the only true... It's pretty much a 50-50 chance to win a game of back around.
[329:57.12]You could say, oh, but what about the red or blue?
[329:59.48]I mean, not the red or blue.
[330:00.40]God damn it.
[330:01.20]What is this?
[330:03.20]the red or black bet at a roulette table is not actually 50-50, because you've got the green number.
[330:09.18]So it's more like 46 or 47% to win a red or black bet at roulette.
[330:15.52]But Baccarat is only banker or player, so... Now there is an opportunity for a tie, but you don't lose money.
[330:28.48]I missed the sad news.
[330:29.48]Oh.
[330:30.54]Boo-fucking-friggity-hoo.
[330:33.09]You know what I'm saying?
[330:34.57]Sad news!
[330:37.99]What's this person want?
[330:40.85]Gambling streamer?
[330:54.20]Um, it depends.
[330:54.96]What do you need?
[330:56.79]I thought that was a gun.
[330:57.59]I thought he was holding a gun in his hands.
[330:58.99]Oh, we're gonna do a free-running video.
[331:06.09]House takes a cut-and-back rap, but that's because it's the easiest game to win.
[331:10.79]I don't think I should be running.
[331:12.22]I mean, but if I don't post this thing, the goblins are going to get me.
[331:16.42]Can you help me out, friend?
[331:17.96]You're my friend, right?
[331:20.16]Yeah, just do whatever, man.
[331:22.08]I mean, use your wings if you want.
[331:30.11]Follow the blips.
[331:34.88]Oh, he's gonna film me doing fun, cool things.
[331:47.12]Yeah!
[331:49.68]Oh, god damn it.
[331:54.58]Oh, nice one, man.
[331:55.64]Good parkouring.
[332:06.32]Alright, how was your video?
[332:11.03]No.
[332:12.09]I actually have to beat it.
[332:19.59]Fuck!
[332:20.13]Stop it!
[332:20.63]Do it!
[332:24.47]Do it!
[332:25.67]Do it!
[332:26.89]Come on, man!
[332:27.49]Do it!
[332:27.81]Impressive!
[332:40.14]skate three flashbacks because I can't do this.
[332:43.43]The tutorial mission.
[332:52.77]Alright, there it is.
[333:03.85]But no, gambling is fun.
[333:07.23]As long as you aren't an insane person.
[333:10.95]You know, if you go to the casino with the sole purpose of having a good time, not to win money, you're gonna be just fine.
[333:22.03]Some people go to the casino and they bring like a thousand dollars and they're like, yeah, I'm gonna turn this thousand dollars into ten grand.
[333:30.11]And then they lose everything.
[333:31.83]They do like a hundred dollar bets at Blackjack and they lose it all.
[333:35.07]And then they go, well, you know, it's only been like an hour or two.
[333:37.27]I'm just gonna get another thousand dollars.
[333:40.27]I don't even do that.
[333:42.89]Orcbond or Riot.
[333:44.61]Better start riding.
[333:48.25]I missed the shrine too.
[333:49.19]Fuck.
[333:51.77]No, I want to do... Let's do a mission.
[333:53.79]Let's return the Jade Statue.
[333:55.13]Do a mission.
[333:56.35]Give me a... I only play with what you can afford to lose.
[334:02.34]Yeah.
[334:03.78]And guess what?
[334:04.86]That can be...
[334:07.05]You can go to the casino with, like, less than 100 bucks and just dick around.
[334:13.51]You don't need to spend that much money.
[334:15.79]People think they have to bring, like, more than 500, 1,000 dollars to a casino.
[334:21.01]You don't gotta do that, man.
[334:22.03]That's how you lose money.
[334:25.03]I love how jermaMustard has turned into the Riot emote.
[334:34.07]Slots.
[334:34.45]Yeah, well, here's the thing about slots, though.
[334:36.31]Slots are good.
[334:37.75]If you don't burn all your money in them.
[334:41.43]You could do... You could do, like, the one cent slots and do, like, ten cent bets.
[334:48.34]And just enjoy it and just hang out.
[334:52.30]You got these, like, fucking 80-year-old ladies that have eight machines in front of them.
[334:56.43]And they're just max betting.
[334:57.95]Three dollar bet, three dollar bet, three dollar, three dollars, three dollars, three dollars.
[335:00.71]They're doing three dollar bets across five to ten machines.
[335:04.97]It's like I almost want to just like walk up and just be like, ma'am, ma'am, ma'am, excuse me.
[335:09.50]You're aware of what's happening?
[335:14.00]Just don't lose.
[335:15.12]Just don't lose the money.
[335:16.06]We'll get to do this one.
[335:19.48]This disarm tackle.
[335:27.69]Why is it always old ladies?
[335:29.67]Because old ladies just get retirement, and they kind of get bored, and they get their checks in the mail, and they just go to the casino and blow a thousand dollars for fun.
[335:40.74]They spend all their 401ks.
[335:48.00]So this is sprint, and then B. And that disarms?
[335:52.56]Alright, so... Ow!
[335:58.53]So all these moves are doing are just replacing ones I already had.
[336:00.87]Because now it's just drop.
[336:04.91]Yeah, that's all it is.
[336:05.77]So I'm not necessarily learning new moves at this point.
[336:09.05]I'm just improving old ones.
[336:14.65]I think it's not even in the fighting mode.
[336:24.14]I was begging for his life and I just murdered him.
[336:32.24]Used to work at a casino.
[336:34.91]But don't get me wrong, it can be a lot of fun.
[336:38.07]Even with the slot machines and stuff, it can be fun.
[336:41.03]But those places are designed by their very nature to fucking keep you there.
[336:46.46]And to make you want to stay forever.
[336:50.64]No, stay.
[336:52.40]You just won $180?
[336:54.60]Stay.
[336:55.98]Stay.
[336:56.40]Go to the roulette table and put a $50 bet on Red 21.
[337:00.94]Do it.
[337:01.98]Isn't it fun?
[337:02.93]Aren't you having a great time?
[337:04.59]Here's another problem with a casino.
[337:07.53]While we're having a casino discussion.
[337:10.49]If you go to a casino, and you bring, let's say you bring like $200 to a casino, and you're like, this is the money I'm going to spend, and that's it.
[337:17.49]you get there maybe it's a long ways away you might have a little bit of travel time it might be more than like an hour or two to get there if you go with a group of friends it's a little different right so you get there let's say you hit a slot machine bonus for like 300 fucking bucks okay now you got 500 um where are you gonna go do you you're going home no you just got there
[337:41.64]worst thing that happens to people is they hit a good amount of money within like 30 minutes of being at the casino because we're gonna be like alright guys and we took us an hour to get here but it's time for us to leave no you're gonna stay there for like at least another three or four hours with your friends
[337:57.29]So the worst thing is to hit early, and then you can't go anywhere, and you have to stay in the casino, and eventually you tell yourself, alright, I'm going to spend this $100 of the house money.
[338:08.69]And then you burn through that money, and you see your friends having a bunch of fun playing blackjack, and you're like, I want to play a hand of blackjack too.
[338:15.46]And you sit down and use another $100 that is not technically your money, but it is at this point.
[338:20.54]Let's go over here.
[338:23.14]I'm going the fuck home.
[338:23.92]Well, how?
[338:25.16]Well, if you didn't drive, let's say it was an hour drive and you didn't, you carpooled with like three or four of your friends.
[338:31.44]How are you going to convince three other people or two other people to leave the place that you just got to?
[338:39.46]They haven't even had a chance to have any fun.
[338:42.29]So you have to like pocket that money and have complete discipline, which guess what?
[338:47.45]Statistically, most of us human meatbags don't have very much of it.
[338:53.40]Oh shit, I just got in a car accident.
[338:54.72]Hold on.
[338:55.02]I have to get this guy's insurance.
[339:00.22]I want my... Spend the rest of the day at the bar, but you're still spending money.
[339:05.74]Stop.
[339:06.06]Human meat bags.
[339:13.49]What is up here?
[339:15.01]Conflicted loyalties.
[339:16.39]New case file.
[339:18.71]Let's just get another fucking mission done.
[339:21.13]We're on a roll right now.
[339:22.03]Might as well do it.
[339:28.12]As long as you have at least a small amount of self-control, the casino can be a really fun place to go.
[339:42.01]Your great-grandfather gambled away the deed to a family gold mine.
[339:45.85]Relax, Ricky.
[339:46.87]I'm just making a joke.
[339:48.55]Holy shit.
[339:49.17]So wait.
[339:50.41]You know Fifi Miao?
[339:51.74]Wow.
[339:52.46]That's terrible.
[339:53.42]Yeah, I heard of her.
[339:54.52]What's she doing these days?
[339:55.94]She's doing another movie in the Stripper Assassin franchise, but I want the role for Vivian.
[340:00.80]That's a great idea.
[340:01.71]I'm
[340:02.45]That would be huge for Vivian.
[340:03.95]Yeah, it would help her profile.
[340:05.65]Damn, dude.
[340:06.93]Goldmine.
[340:07.87]Yeah, you're right.
[340:09.11]Good call.
[340:09.57]We're releasing the track that King produced tonight.
[340:12.68]You have a great time.
[340:14.20]You and the hottest star in Hong Kong.
[340:16.74]Go, have fun.
[340:18.62]And look, you can be, if you really want to, and there is like an adrenaline rush about it, right?
[340:24.25]Let's say you're at the blackjack table.
[340:26.71]I'll have to, that's disgusting.
[340:29.57]Yeah, if Vivian pisses me off, that's where she'll end up.
[340:34.15]But there's more money if I keep her a star.
[340:36.83]I just have to make sure she doesn't flake out on me.
[340:40.22]I want you to put some cameras up in an apartment.
[340:42.94]I need it done right away.
[340:44.62]Can you organize that for me?
[340:46.32]Yeah, of course, Sonny.
[340:47.46]I'll take care of it for you.
[340:48.76]Okay.
[340:50.00]Here's the address.
[340:50.68]There's a box of stuff over by the elevator.
[340:52.58]Go to the apartment building.
[340:54.00]Okay.
[341:03.68]Um, but no, what I was saying is, you're able to, if you hit a bunch of money, let's say you're on a roll at the blackjack table, and holy shit, you've been sitting there for like 45 minutes, and nothing's going wrong, you're getting 20 every fucking hand, you're getting 21, you're getting 19 like every hand, and you win like 10 fucking hands in a row.
[341:25.17]It's possible, and it happens a lot.
[341:28.02]you got like two or three hundred dollars in chips look if you feel like being a psycho for one hand go do it be a fucking psycho and do like a 75 bet on one hand and guess what you hit blackjack go fucking home if you don't pack it up as long as you don't like waste all the money that you have it might be fun I've done it
[341:54.28]I did a $75 blackjack hand and hit blackjack when I did it.
[341:58.24]And at that point it was like... Oh my fucking god!
[342:04.22]And I packed it up.
[342:05.96]I had like three... That was like two or three hundred dollars that I won.
[342:08.89]I packed it up and moved right to a slot machine.
[342:12.35]Put in my $300 voucher and it was gone in about 30 minutes.
[342:16.13]Don't be like me.
[342:17.55]Pack it up.
[342:23.06]I mean, I packed it up physically and put it in my wallet and... Talk to the doorman.
[342:37.09]Thank god it's right here.
[342:43.17]No no no no no no no no no no no no no no no.
[342:52.81]Holy shit, it's not stopping.
[342:53.89]What is this thing?
[342:54.53]Press Y!
[342:55.09]Shit, Y didn't work.
[342:56.45]Never mind.
[343:22.45]Killed him with an umbrella.
[343:30.25]Sir!
[343:38.26]That guy has... Yeah, he's been the smartest guard so far.
[343:41.10]For sure.
[343:45.74]Looks like we're going around here.
[343:50.13]Climb up this building.
[343:51.96]I got the green.
[343:52.90]Please, Mirror's Edge, climb up here.
[343:54.92]This is the thing you can climb up on, Mirror's Edge.
[343:59.22]Yes.
[344:10.59]Really?
[344:10.91]Come on.
[344:12.35]Fucking had an opportunity there.
[344:23.09]What are you doing?
[344:24.23]Climb up that.
[344:26.13]What the fuck, man?
[344:28.22]I can't go over that.
[344:32.56]How was he before?
[344:33.58]Remember everyone was saying, you're gonna come back here sooner or later.
[344:37.62]Pasta time.
[344:53.63]I just blew up his head.
[344:54.37]Uh-huh.
[345:03.75]Now where?
[345:05.94]Cross the moat.
[345:11.48]You've been here since the start?
[345:12.52]That's about six hours.
[345:14.96]Boy, speaking of the start, I just went around in a circle.
[345:19.63]Oh my god, what are you doing, Jeremy?
[345:29.82]I don't know what the fuck just happened.
[345:37.68]I don't know why I went that way.
[345:38.70]I remember coming up here, I remember snorting this.
[345:54.27]And eventually coming here, we get a statue, right?
[345:57.87]Yep.
[346:00.56]Copy computer files.
[346:02.65]Gets an extra computer time.
[346:11.35]What am I doing?
[346:12.99]Playing a game called Sleeping Dogs.
[346:22.92]Six goes here.
[346:24.48]Let's go with seven.
[346:29.74]Hacker extraordinaire.
[346:33.34]Pendrew wants to talk to you at the central rendezvous tonight.
[346:36.72]Bug the kitchen.
[346:42.54]Where?
[346:42.80]The stove?
[346:45.70]Under the stove?
[346:46.26]Under the sink?
[346:47.48]Who has a vent in their kitchen island?
[346:49.64]I don't know.
[346:50.86]What is in here?
[346:53.52]Heat?
[346:54.06]Air conditioning?
[346:54.75]Why would you have this?
[346:57.19]This thing is movable.
[347:01.39]Local Screamer gets lucky.
[347:02.40]I've done those pretty much without any problem at all for the last six hours.
[347:10.48]Running out of time.
[347:26.73]Got it.
[347:27.79]Jump off the roof.
[347:29.96]Hide up.
[347:30.58]Oh, we gotta hide.
[347:34.69]Just stomping around into the closet?
[347:38.71]Yes.
[347:39.63]You look beyond beautiful tonight.
[347:41.71]Every time I looked at you, all I could think was, I can't believe she's real.
[347:46.60]Oh, Ricky.
[347:47.42]She's too perfect to be real.
[347:49.02]Seriously.
[347:50.24]Every woman wanted to be you, and every guy wanted to.
[347:53.88]Well, you know.
[347:54.84]Ricky, you have such a one-track mind.
[348:01.09]It might be.
[348:04.09]Cheated on.
[348:05.37]Here she comes.
[348:08.69]Didn't close the door.
[348:09.87]Plant camera in the bedroom.
[348:14.13]What the fuck would I do that for?
[348:15.57]Wait, where's the bedroom?
[348:20.72]Is she in the bedroom right now?
[348:23.28]Well, that's the bathroom.
[348:25.56]Oh, ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-ba.
[348:28.35]I'm in the bedroom, so where do I need to put a camera?
[348:30.43]Why am I putting a camera in here?
[348:35.78]What?
[348:41.68]Doesn't take that long.
[348:43.18]It really doesn't.
[348:44.80]Retrieve the memory stick without being seen.
[349:02.60]We're so sloppy.
[349:15.82]Oh, the pressure of me going down.
[349:17.18]I want to punch him.
[349:18.47]No, let's finish the mission.
[349:19.63]Go on.
[349:25.89]I wanted to punch him, but I couldn't.
[349:35.12]I think I lost his hat.
[349:54.88]And mission accomplished.
[350:00.06]Hey, Jake Sunshine, thanks for the ten bucks.
[350:04.23]How you doing?
[350:05.35]Also, to add to the endless list of games people have been recommending, Darkwood is terrifying.
[350:08.88]I'd love to see you shit your pants.
[350:11.32]Now, what about Sonny Woe?
[350:13.50]Anything new there?
[350:14.92]I should play Darkwood.
[350:16.20]That's top down, right?
[350:17.76]Top down kind of limited supplies horror game.
[350:22.68]I'm not a big fan.
[350:23.54]I don't think the game is bad.
[350:25.36]I just wasn't doing it for me.
[350:26.98]Whatever we can get to stick to Sonny Woe will obviously hurt Big Smile Lee.
[350:31.40]Seemed pretty interesting, but just couldn't get into it.
[350:35.25]Fine.
[350:37.07]LA Noire VR?
[350:37.65]It's on the way.
[350:38.09]Thank you, Jake.
[350:38.75]Is there a bike floating?
[351:01.18]Very well.
[351:01.90]It is.
[351:02.84]Get me the video and he walks.
[351:04.78]I'll get it.
[351:06.32]Alright, I have to go.
[351:08.50]Is it?
[351:08.70]Is it on the street?
[351:09.64]That's in a weird place on the street.
[351:10.94]Yeah, that was in a really odd place.
[351:30.62]Oh, it is getting late.
[351:31.92]What time is it?
[351:32.44]One o'clock in the morning Eastern?
[351:35.49]Six hours.
[351:36.05]I'm probably going to say, once I complete this mission, we probably should wrap it up.
[351:49.25]And then over the weekend, this weekend, or maybe even on Monday, I will turn the stream on again and we will continue Sleeping Dogs and get to the end of
[352:00.79]of a sleeping dog.
[352:07.31]Because it is getting late, and once you get to like the six hour mark, especially starting at seven o'clock... Fuck am I... how do I get in my own house?
[352:21.20]It's right here, right?
[352:22.08]Let's make sure computer time.
[352:35.06]Finish it now?
[352:35.72]I don't think it's going to be possible.
[352:38.94]There's probably another at least two or three hours of this game left.
[352:46.20]Vivian?
[352:47.58]What are you doing here?
[352:48.66]Well, Sonny says you've been really helpful to me.
[352:50.60]Well, plus the DLC is available as well, so.
[352:51.88]And to me.
[352:53.46]And I just wanted to thank you.
[352:58.51]Vivian, no.
[353:00.09]Wait, wait.
[353:01.47]What's this about?
[353:02.79]Nothing, I just...
[353:05.13]I just can't... God, Sonny's gonna kill me.
[353:08.72]Well, that turned around.
[353:09.50]Sonny sent you here?
[353:10.58]Yeah, don't you know that... Know what?
[353:13.38]I just... I can't do it anymore.
[353:15.34]Sonny will just... Sonny will just have to get another girl.
[353:20.18]Look, Vivian, you don't need to.
[353:22.22]Not with me, okay?
[353:24.53]Where's my grenade launcher?
[353:25.55]I just realized that as well.
[353:26.43]You mean you're okay with it?
[353:28.81]No, that's not because you grabbed my dick.
[353:30.19]Like, that's not the gun.
[353:31.69]I mean, whatever.
[353:32.83]You're the first guy who's ever... I mean...
[353:37.34]Thanks, Wei.
[353:40.22]Turn off the stream.
[353:49.69]Do a funny bike grenade joke.
[353:52.98]I'm going to do a funny time to end the stream joke.
[354:00.33]Because what we'll do over the weekend is we'll clean up the rest of the game.
[354:06.26]Off schedule, I can't, I don't know, I have no idea when.
[354:08.74]There's at least two or three things I have to do over this weekend, so.
[354:14.66]My Xbox controller just turned off.
[354:19.38]So we'll finish this over the weekend.
[354:22.10]We'll do one, we'll do the final mission.
[354:26.06]This one here.
[354:27.02]Then it'll be done.
[354:31.71]way did you bring the video and jackie done this should be all I need to put sunny woe away for a long time and with uncle how'd you hear about that thanks good news travels fast I'll have Raymond arrange your debriefing congratulations way what are you saying yeah no let's end it saying it's over let's end it here you've done your job it's time to come in
[354:54.78]Because after we do the bits and the credits, we'll be probably around seven hours.
[354:59.48]Your mission was an unbelievable success.
[355:01.54]I must admit, I thought you'd be happy.
[355:03.58]Big Smiley will take over.
[355:05.11]It'll be even worse than it was under Poe.
[355:07.27]I can't come in now.
[355:08.45]I'm not finished yet.
[355:09.61]I understand your personal reasons for doing this, your history with the Sun On Ye.
[355:14.45]This is why I selected you.
[355:16.12]But you've done more than enough.
[355:18.53]Yeah, it's getting late.
[355:20.67]I don't want to go into like 2, 3, 4 o'clock in the morning stream.
[355:23.57]Well, bad dream.
[355:49.31]Shuffle the deck, we're back on casinos.
[355:53.18]Not necessarily.
[355:55.78]And then next week, if you're not going to stick around and go to... I talk like it's an amusement park.
[356:02.01]If you're not going to come to the...
[356:04.71]Saturday or Sunday or Monday stream to finish this.
[356:09.61]Nintendo Labo is going to be next week, probably Friday.
[356:12.73]And there's a couple other things that might happen spontaneously.
[356:17.49]So keep your eyes on the ground, you know what I mean?
[356:19.05]Keep your eyes to the ground to be able to see and hear all those things.
[356:24.67]So we're going to call it there.
[356:26.33]Yeah, let me just call it here at like exactly six hours.
[356:28.93]We'll do about an hour after stream.
[356:31.65]Chilling, you know, let me just sleep and save it.
[356:34.90]Nintendo Labo will probably be this Friday, so exactly one week from today.
[356:40.82]Keep your eyes on the ground.
[356:51.81]Fuck the phone.
[356:53.93]Alright.
[356:57.35]But this is Friday.
[356:59.81]Well, next Friday is going to be the Labo stream.
[357:09.88]So let's look forward to that.
[357:11.82]Should be fun.
[357:14.55]I'm going to smash the Labo.
[357:17.33]Why would I do something like that?
[357:18.53]That thing's $100 fucking dollars.
[357:21.56]Turn this off here.
[357:23.88]Thanks for sticking around.
[357:24.58]If you are not going to stick around for the credits and the bits, then it's always been a pleasure.
[357:32.66]Take care, guys.
[357:33.88]Thanks for sticking around.
[357:35.46]See you soon.
[357:36.24]If you want to come over the weekend, if you want to come over to my house on the weekend, I'm going to have a party where we play Sleeping Dogs in front of people.
[357:44.67]But let's do the credits.
[357:45.43]These are all the new subs and all the resubs.
[357:50.23]Lots of subs.
[357:51.35]You guys are great.
[357:52.41]You guys spoil the shit out of me.
[357:54.93]Here they come.
[357:56.69]Credits.

[360:22.62]Thank you guys for your continued support of this channel.
[360:27.70]You rock.
[360:30.21]Those are all the resubs and subs tonight on stream.
[360:33.47]Much love to you.
[360:35.70]Now let's get to the bits that I missed a lot of.
[360:41.66]This over here.
[360:44.02]Sixth hour reached.
[360:45.10]Hydrate.
[360:47.56]Look, I'll hydrate when I'm dead.
[360:49.10]You know what I mean?
[360:52.76]Thank you, FlubbaGut, for the $1.
[360:54.08]Hey, Jerma.
[360:55.92]Not sure if you confirmed the move to Nevada, but how will it affect stream times?
[361:00.59]I'm a UK fan and already miss your streams most of the time due to them being quite late at night.
[361:05.17]Well, thanks for the $1 flubber.
[361:06.33]If I move to the West Coast, I will be on Pacific time.
[361:10.58]Which means... I'm not going to stream at 7 p.m.
[361:14.80]Pacific.
[361:15.72]That would be absurd.
[361:17.10]That's so late.
[361:18.30]That's 11 o'clock.
[361:20.88]Or 10 o'clock for Eastern time.
[361:23.84]So there's no way.
[361:24.68]If I move to Nevada, I will probably pull the stream back probably two hours.
[361:30.56]So instead of starting at 7 p.m.
[361:31.98]Eastern, I will start around probably 5 p.m.
[361:33.84]Eastern.
[361:36.85]Nevada is Pacific.
[361:39.05]Las Vegas is three hours behind.
[361:43.39]From where I am now.
[361:46.77]But, yeah, that's what you can expect.
[361:49.26]The stream will pull back about two hours.
[361:53.76]Don't go to Nevada.
[361:54.58]Well, I would be living in Las Vegas.
[361:55.80]10 p.m.
[361:55.92]EU.
[362:03.16]That would be, uh... What would that be?
[362:06.40]I'm gonna use just, like... I'm gonna use just, like, the United Kingdom for this.
[362:11.86]So it's about, what, four or five hours ahead of Eastern?
[362:14.84]So that would be... If I start at two hours earlier, that's... Nine or... Yeah, like, nine or ten p.m.
[362:23.06]would be a start for a lot of the European crowd.
[362:30.28]Why would I... Why did my mom move to Vegas?
[362:33.06]Well, speaking of casinos.
[362:35.60]No, Las Vegas never turns off.
[362:38.24]And I've come to realize something about myself.
[362:41.96]It's taken me a lot of soul searching to figure this out.
[362:44.88]But I will never have a normal human schedule.
[362:47.40]Ever.
[362:48.14]It will never happen.
[362:50.34]So, I need to just kind of deal with it.
[362:52.00]I need to live with it.
[362:53.50]My sleep patterns and my... I have a lot of medical fucking problems that annoy the shit out of me, right?
[362:59.01]That make it so I sleep at random fucking times.
[363:01.43]And...
[363:02.67]Las Vegas doesn't ever turn off.
[363:06.23]So if I erratically sleep for six hours and wake up at four in the morning, three in the morning, it don't matter.
[363:14.68]The whole town is still on.
[363:15.76]The city fucking doesn't sleep.
[363:18.02]So I could wake up at two o'clock in the morning and go get dinner at an incredibly, like, five-star restaurant if I really wanted to, right?
[363:33.58]It allows me to do whatever I want.
[363:36.33]Essentially, like, on my own time.
[363:39.37]On top of streaming, right?
[363:40.33]On top of doing... There's a lot of other opportunities out there, so... It's like a 40-minute plane ride to Los Angeles.
[363:47.44]So, if there's ever anything I want to do... If I want to go to LA and do some... Video stuff.
[363:53.56]Which is very possible.
[363:54.44]There's a lot of people out there that I know and that I talk to very frequently.
[363:58.37]That we talk about making videos and stuff.
[363:59.83]And it would be nice to be close...
[364:03.91]I have to finish New Vegas before I can move to Las Vegas.
[364:12.21]But yeah, it can get... I love the East Coast, I do.
[364:17.56]But I need to be in a place where I can kind of do... And look, I'm not going to Vegas to go do a bunch of drugs and throw my money in the toilet.
[364:26.29]That's not me.
[364:28.17]I am like, I'm almost like stone cold fucking sober as you could possibly be as a person.
[364:33.44]So I'm not going to Vegas to go like, have a good fucking time.
[364:36.92]You know what I mean?
[364:38.48]It's different.
[364:40.94]So don't worry about that.
[364:41.88]That's not going to happen.
[364:43.74]Sure.
[364:48.17]And plus, I was only going to live there for maybe like a year.
[364:52.10]Find, like, a nice apartment to just kind of be out there for, like, six months or a year or at least.
[364:56.68]Just see.
[364:57.04]Just do it.
[364:58.04]Just try it, you know?
[364:59.60]I'm not going to say, you know what?
[365:01.08]I can't wait to solidify and concrete my feet in the ground in Las Vegas.
[365:06.34]Just something different.
[365:06.98]Something to try.
[365:10.32]That's the long-winded version of that.
[365:13.52]To answer your question in a sentence, if I move to the West Coast, the stream will pull back about two or three hours from where it is right now.
[365:22.70]Thank you, Flub.
[365:24.44]Oh, thank you, Grizzly1620 for the $1.
[365:28.64]Hey, big boy, I finally got a new job, so here's a dollar for my first paycheck.
[365:32.64]However, even when I'm not giving bits, I'll always be supporting you, my man.
[365:37.10]As I've said many times before, thank you for the joy and positivity you bring to my life.
[365:41.48]Love you.
[365:42.68]Thank you, Grizzly.
[365:44.44]Right back at you, dude.
[365:45.14]Thanks a lot.
[365:47.42]Pina Chip, thank you for the $3.
[365:48.88]Jerma, I loved your comedy video speech about life.
[365:52.14]I think a lot of people needed to hear that.
[365:53.46]Thank you.
[365:56.84]Life is Strange.
[365:58.70]And I'm not talking about, you know, the trademarked rewind time to save your girlfriend.
[366:04.63]Life is Strange.
[366:06.07]Thank you, Pina Chip.
[366:07.45]Appreciate the $3.
[366:10.09]Eyebags.
[366:10.61]By the way, that was a heavy spoiler.
[366:12.73]The game's been up for like nine years, so who cares?
[366:15.84]Eye bags, thanks for the $1.
[366:17.14]Ants or A Bug's Life.
[366:19.38]Both of those movies were so completely and totally just so out of my brain and so just not important to me at all that I don't even remember one plot point from either one of them.
[366:31.54]So I'm going to just roll the dice here and I'm going to say A Bug's Life.
[366:36.46]Thank you, Peaceful Haley, for the $1.
[366:38.11]Play Simpsons Road Rage also.
[366:39.67]How's it going?
[366:40.03]It's going well.
[366:40.67]Thank you.
[366:42.21]Thank you, Peaceful Haley.
[366:44.68]Spreeo, thanks for the $1.
[366:46.00]Breaking news.
[366:46.62]Shorter than average man found wandering his local woods with a portable hotspot and a urethra full of ants.
[366:54.42]Quite the news story.
[366:55.94]Thank you, Mr. Fancy, for the $1.
[366:59.73]Have you seen the first episode of Season 2 of Westworld?
[367:02.65]Am hyped.
[367:03.85]I have seen the second season of Westworld, the first episode.
[367:08.17]And I'm going to give you my opinion on it based on how I felt about the first season.
[367:11.25]So, here you go.
[367:13.31]Spoiler alert!
[367:15.41]Spoiler alert!
[367:16.93]Shut down your internet, turn- unplug your fucking ethernet from your computer.
[367:21.81]Mute and unplug your ethernet.
[367:25.01]For the next 30 seconds.
[367:27.53]Starting... I'm gonna count exact- come back in exactly 30 seconds.
[367:32.63]Ready?
[367:33.67]All the people that don't want to hear this shit, starting right now, mute now!
[367:38.31]Mute now!
[367:38.83]Okay, you have 30- come back in 30 seconds.
[367:40.33]Mute now!
[367:41.41]Last chance.
[367:43.29]Okay, so I was of the opinion that Westworld did not need another season.
[367:48.27]I felt that was a complete package.
[367:50.21]And the second season of Westworld almost feels like if Telltale got the IP and had to force themselves to come up with another storyline for a second season.
[368:00.52]It just doesn't feel like it's necessary.
[368:03.72]That whole first season was such a complete package.
[368:07.56]Look, it's only been one episode, so we'll see what the fuck is going on there, but I really don't think it needed a second season.
[368:13.55]Okay, everyone is safe.
[368:19.33]I'm not going to get like say, oh, by the way, how is this spoilers?
[368:23.00]This is not spoilers, but I don't know.
[368:24.82]You know me.
[368:26.02]At some point during that conversation, I could have said something that was an absolute spoiler.
[368:29.42]I didn't want to even get to the, I didn't want to have a chance.
[368:33.80]So I didn't want to accidentally say something during that little period.
[368:39.68]None of that was spoilers.
[368:40.51]It doesn't matter.
[368:41.21]I wanted to make sure I didn't have the chance to do it.
[368:44.76]WoW is spoilers?
[368:46.45]WoW is spoilers.
[368:48.13]Um, Gul'dan fucking is the guy that opens up the Dark Portal.
[368:53.56]And Anduin dies.
[368:57.26]No.
[368:57.66]King Varian dies and Anduin takes over his place and he becomes a fucking... turd king.
[369:03.72]And then the Legion comes and they lose.
[369:07.42]Anyways.
[369:07.72]Uh, that's what I feel.
[369:10.73]I just feel like it didn't... You know, whatever.
[369:12.67]We already talked about it.
[369:13.43]Let's keep going.
[369:14.01]Scripps!
[369:14.37]Hey, Scripps.
[369:14.83]Thanks for the $1.
[369:17.03]Jerma, can you actually sing?
[369:18.09]Like, no joke.
[369:18.73]How good are you at singing?
[369:20.61]You seem to have a good deep range.
[369:24.14]Um... I can sing...
[369:27.48]But not on camera sing.
[369:31.18]If I'm alone in my car, I can belt out a few lines, but... Not an on-camera or recorded kind of way.
[369:39.99]I get too self-conscious and too embarrassed of what I'm doing.
[369:42.91]And this happens all the time.
[369:45.28]If I'm doing something that is considered a very highly skilled thing to do, I get pre-embarrassed about it.
[369:51.84]Even if I know I can do it.
[369:53.64]So my pre-embarrassment and my pre-self-consciousness stops me from doing the thing that I know I can do.
[370:00.67]I can sing pretty well.
[370:03.25]For the shower.
[370:07.16]What about in a pre-recorded way?
[370:08.90]If I pre-recorded a song, I could probably do it pretty well.
[370:13.84]But not, like, live on stream.
[370:18.84]But yeah, there you go.
[370:21.20]Uh, Jaredin, thanks for the 35 cents.
[370:23.56]Just started watching your streams last Wednesday.
[370:25.96]Have really enjoyed myself so far.
[370:27.48]Here's to many more streams to come.
[370:28.64]Thanks, Jaredin.
[370:30.83]Glad you stumbled upon this stream.
[370:35.11]Thanks for sticking around.
[370:37.51]Hopefully you enjoy the more streams to come.
[370:41.17]Thanks, dude.
[370:43.54]Thank you, Spreo, for the 25 cents.
[370:45.15]This is driving... This is driving... It's already reminding me of True Crime New York.
[370:51.31]And then they say LUL in all capitals, which, as we know, is the biscuit belt.
[370:58.89]You know, like belting out laughter.
[371:00.23]That's the biscuit belt of laughter.
[371:06.07]Thank you, Bo.
[371:06.90]Thank you.
[371:07.38]Appreciate it.
[371:07.90]Haunty, thank you, Haunty, for the $5.00.
[371:10.88]Thanks for the laughs over the years, Jerma.
[371:12.16]Your video streams always help when I'm feeling down.
[371:14.27]Thank you, Haunty.
[371:17.41]Appreciate that.
[371:18.07]Much love to you, man.
[371:21.47]One Blondie gave $10 earlier and didn't say anything.
[371:25.04]Just gave $10.
[371:25.98]Thank you, Blondie, for the $10.
[371:28.78]Bitslave.
[371:29.48]Hey, Bitslave.
[371:30.40]How are you?
[371:30.82]I wonder what's going to happen to you at this stage in your life because there might be something bad.
[371:36.33]You might be... I'm about to read the bad thing you did to get these bits.
[371:39.83]Hey, Jerma, I know I'm not supposed to do this anymore, but I saw an old lady walking on the sidewalk, so I just had to rub her over and take her purse for these sweet, succulent bits.
[371:50.54]Here's your cut.
[371:52.10]I'll keep an eye out for any more babushkas.
[371:56.13]Thanks for the 25 cents again, Bitslave.
[371:58.01]Run, run her over.
[371:59.01]I repeat, run.
[371:59.75]I did not rub an old lady.
[372:01.15]Alright, that's, there we go.
[372:02.41]Thank you, Bitslave, for the 25 cents.
[372:03.81]Appreciate that 25 cent donation.
[372:05.83]That's fantastic.
[372:07.07]Thank you.
[372:07.82]Hero Link, thanks for the 25 cents.
[372:10.70]He's trying to say Rob.
[372:12.16]Rob.
[372:15.50]Rob an old lady.
[372:16.86]Rob, R-O-B.
[372:18.22]Rob an old lady.
[372:21.24]Hero Link, thanks for the $25.
[372:23.80]I ate a Duracell battery today and they were not crunchy as advertised.
[372:29.98]Thank you, CyanTF2 for the $1 bad bit.
[372:32.27]Thank you, Moo Man's... I was going to say Moo Man 61.
[372:37.95]You and Boo had like a weird child together, apparently.
[372:41.47]Thank you, Moo Means Moo for the $1.
[372:43.63]What the fuck is with all those old horror movies?
[372:46.26]All their names have words in them.
[372:50.62]We've already talked about that.
[372:53.87]MetalGearSolidFan18, thanks for the $5.
[372:57.87]Twitch had a sale on bits for Prime members.
[372:59.75]You're literally the only streamer I watch, so they're all yours.
[373:03.05]Thank you.
[373:04.15]They say, thanks for all the years of content.
[373:05.71]I remember discovering your YouTube channel when I was looking for TF2 videos.
[373:08.70]So glad I did.
[373:11.30]Thank you, MGSFan.
[373:14.30]Appreciate the $5.
[373:15.30]Much love to you, dude.
[373:16.82]Thank you for giving those to me.
[373:23.16]Thanks.
[373:23.76]Sly161, thanks for the $2.50.
[373:25.10]You know, the TV show Pawn Stars.
[373:28.02]I was in the area once and went to that pawn shop.
[373:30.64]The shop is actually just one long hallway with TVs playing clips from Pawn Stars on it.
[373:36.32]There was a line at the back of the store for getting your picture taken with a cardboard cutout of the store owner.
[373:42.38]It wasn't even life-sized.
[373:45.38]So you're saying that reality TV isn't real?
[373:50.80]What?! !
[373:54.79]Thank you, Sly.
[373:57.02]That's fucked up.
[373:59.34]Butterfingers, thanks for the 25 cents.
[374:00.86]I just saw Infinity War and had a great time.
[374:02.48]Weirdly, it made me more inspired about creators in general, so thanks for the laughs over the years.
[374:08.66]Really?
[374:11.11]Butterfing- No, no, not the- Infinity War made you- Is, like, PewDiePie in Infinity War?
[374:27.11]Rewind.
[374:28.19]Let's try that again.
[374:31.11]I'm glad you liked Infinity War.
[374:33.85]Not Infinity Ward.
[374:38.08]Thank you.
[374:41.56]You can tell when I start getting tired, man.
[374:43.06]I lose steam.
[374:46.26]Steam just emits from my ears and I just lose all my energy.
[374:52.45]But thank you, Butterfingers.
[374:53.27]Appreciate it.
[374:53.81]John Arbuckle, thanks for the 25 cents.
[374:55.67]I know a sleeping dog.
[374:56.69]His name is Odie.
[374:58.44]That's very cute.
[375:00.34]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[375:02.42]Garfield in Paradise.
[375:03.50]I'm saddened to see the Oscars statue get retired, but he will always be remembered in the Jerma Hall of Fame right next to being Bagsonic.
[375:11.56]Anyway, Garf would like to know if you figured out what movies turned into video games you'd want.
[375:16.04]Besides Garfield Kart, I'd want a Gremlins game like Pikmin or a game that makes you recruit different gremlins around the world.
[375:24.19]Uh, I think I... What movie for a video game?
[375:26.85]Um... Um... Dunstan Checks In.
[375:34.30]That would be a great game.
[375:35.48]And it would be, because it would be a stealth game.
[375:38.04]But thanks, though, dude.
[375:38.70]Thank you, Bitslay, for the 25 cents.
[375:40.06]I took these bits from Garfield the Monday Killer, personal Swiss bank account.
[375:45.30]Stolen.
[375:45.90]Thank you.
[375:47.15]Uh, Spreo, thanks for the 25 cents.
[375:48.77]Jail for you, jail for you, jail for everyone.
[375:53.16]as they say uh gear dude thanks for the 25 cents say a sentence you've never said before I can't wait to play Minecraft tomorrow no I probably I know I've said that um how about uh put your hands up this is a stick up give me all the money in the register never said that before
[376:22.51]Well, I mean, hold on.
[376:23.61]Actually, I have said that because I've been role-playing jokingly in, like, Grand Theft Auto.
[376:28.81]I've said that.
[376:31.21]Sentence I've never said.
[376:36.23]Sure, I will share my french fries with you.
[376:40.17]Definitely not.
[376:41.56]Get your run.
[376:43.14]They're too delicious and crispy.
[376:44.54]Get the fuck out of here.
[376:47.96]But thank you, Gear Dude.
[376:48.74]Thank you, again, Melon Chili Sauce.
[376:50.48]Gave $50 earlier.
[376:52.86]Thank you.
[376:53.18]That's a lot of money, man.
[376:57.33]We acknowledged it before, but I want to acknowledge it again.
[377:00.79]Thank you.
[377:02.63]Really, you're an asshole.
[377:06.23]No, no, no, not Melon Chili Sauce.
[377:08.09]He's not.
[377:09.07]No.
[377:09.75]Somebody, I'm reading that somebody just wrote in the chat.
[377:12.49]No, I'm not an asshole.
[377:14.70]I come from a world where back in high school, fries were currency.
[377:20.44]Fries were gold.
[377:22.63]You got your food, and then you got the fries, and they were so good, and everybody always wanted some.
[377:27.32]They always wanted to fucking take them from you.
[377:30.10]So it was tradition.
[377:31.90]Because you would come with your tray, and you'd sit down at the fucking table, and like three hands would come and grab fucking fries and laugh and eat them, and it's like, fuck you, man.
[377:40.45]So what everybody used to do, is before they sat down at the table, because they saw the vultures, all like the 15 dudes at the table, vultures, waiting to steal your fries, you would just take the fry bag, or the little Coney Island fry carrier, and you'd hold it up to your face, and you'd go...
[378:00.44]and you'd pretend you'd cough all over the fucking fries.
[378:02.52]And then everybody backed off, they were like, oh, okay, alright.
[378:05.22]That's how you had to do it back then.
[378:08.33]They were gold.
[378:13.25]So then nobody would touch them.
[378:17.31]And by the way, that's a great technique.
[378:20.13]If you have people take like food off your fucking plate and laugh and eat it and shit,
[378:24.86]buddies of mine used to do it and I used to do it to them too but only if they didn't do the cough all over my fries bit it's classic nobody wants to touch them after that trust me gum was money yeah gum was money too uh 13th onion thanks for the one dollar
[378:51.80]Hey, have you gotten the suggestion thread going in the Discord?
[378:53.97]Never mind, apparently it's being worked on.
[378:56.75]He said that right after the other.
[378:58.29]Thanks for the $2, 13th Onion.
[378:59.45]Appreciate it, man.
[379:01.07]Hiya, Dip.
[379:01.63]Thanks for the $1.
[379:02.33]They say, uh, they say, haha.
[379:04.49]They say, party 100, haha.
[379:08.02]They did that, the face, that, um,
[379:10.99]The Andy Samberg face.
[379:12.37]I think that's on better twitch.tv, whatever it is.
[379:16.41]Yeah, the one that is like, you know, the streamer is not funny and he's a loser and I hate him.
[379:20.59]That emote, whatever it is.
[379:23.37]Creature, thanks Creature for the $1.
[379:25.89]Why you do this?
[379:27.87]Why you do this?
[379:28.57]Sorry.
[379:28.83]I don't know what I did, but I'm going to preemptively or postemptively apologize.
[379:34.37]Reaper500, thanks for the $1.
[379:35.89]Hey Jerma, I heard you're going to play the new God of War.
[379:37.97]Then I propose a challenge for the stream.
[379:40.56]Take a shot every time Kratos says, boy.
[379:43.94]Don't worry.
[379:45.42]I'll only be Kratos as that one.
[379:48.48]Wait, don't worry.
[379:49.44]I'll only be Kratos as the one that counts.
[379:54.94]I don't feel like dying, so the answer is no.
[379:59.23]I don't like to drink streams.
[380:00.65]If I'm going to do a drink stream, I just casually sip on a drink.
[380:05.17]I'm not, like, taking shots for X, Y, Z. That's how you fucking... No.
[380:10.25]Not gonna happen.
[380:12.13]I will casually drink alcohol on stream sometimes.
[380:15.47]Like, one or two drinks.
[380:18.63]Or if, like, a friend's over, maybe, like, three or four, but then that's it.
[380:21.85]I don't like the idea of being, like, shit-faced on a stream.
[380:26.15]It's, like, uncomfortable for me.
[380:31.79]But anyways.
[380:32.79]Thank you, Bitslave, for the 25.25.
[380:35.29]50 cents in total.
[380:38.85]I need you to say oh-woo, not oh-wo.
[380:41.87]But oh as in ooh-ah, and woo as in... Thank you, Bitslave, for the other 25 cents.
[380:47.68]So apparently O-W-O is pronounced oh-wo.
[380:50.14]Please give me five samples of you saying oh-wo.
[380:54.12]Well, you got it.
[380:54.74]You got it there.
[380:55.30]I've said it like at least four or five times.
[380:56.70]Thank you for the 50 cents.
[380:59.59]TechnoToast, thanks for the 50 cents.
[381:01.01]I'll be expecting your Xbox controller thesis on my desk by 11.59pm on Tuesday.
[381:08.54]Fucking god damn it.
[381:13.66]Why are you using an Xbox controller?
[381:15.52]Use PC, stupid!
[381:18.79]Nobody said that, but that's what I hear.
[381:21.03]Is that bad that that's what I hear?
[381:22.57]Somebody called me stupid.
[381:23.89]We've been playing Sleeping Dogs for three days straight.
[381:26.51]Somebody was angry that I used an Xbox controller.
[381:28.92]They were.
[381:29.22]I remember looking at it in chat and being like, what is it, you fucking stupid?
[381:32.70]It's like, I'm not fucking stupid.
[381:34.12]I just want to use a goddamn controller.
[381:42.27]No, the Steam Controller is a piece of dogshit.
[381:45.38]Don't ever use the Steam Controller.
[381:47.78]If you bought it within the last 30 days, refund it and get your money back.
[381:51.72]And go buy a steak.
[381:53.70]You'll have more enjoyment.
[382:00.03]Controversy.
[382:11.51]Use the Donkey Kongabongas.
[382:17.62]Go spend like $45 at the casino.
[382:21.22]You might be able to get some money back.
[382:25.54]Anywho.
[382:26.96]Thank you to Propanator for the $5.
[382:29.22]You're one of my top three favorite streamers and this is just a tiny token of appreciation.
[382:36.33]Thank you.
[382:37.99]I am forever grateful.
[382:39.79]Propanator.
[382:41.95]To be listed in the top three is... That means a lot.
[382:46.67]I'm happy that you think that way.
[382:48.59]Thank you.
[382:50.44]Snakes1223, thanks for the $1, Jerma.
[382:52.58]When are we going to get those awesome rat sona art?
[382:54.96]I don't know what that means.
[382:58.34]Probably never.
[382:58.88]Thank you, SticksRenegade, for the $1.
[383:00.42]Fun fact number 621, Jerma985 said, Jeremy is a furry.
[383:05.37]That's not...
[383:08.02]Oh, you're talking about now.
[383:09.00]Oh, okay, I did.
[383:09.78]Alright, that's fine.
[383:11.34]I, well, I did say it now.
[383:14.04]So you're correct.
[383:15.94]Thanks, and Adam for the 25 cents.
[383:18.49]Jerma, what is your fursona?
[383:19.89]Ah, let's move on.
[383:20.53]Techno Toast, thanks for the 50 cents.
[383:21.89]I heard a rumor that you have a clown suit.
[383:24.43]What does your clown sona look?
[383:25.67]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.50.
[383:28.23]What about a Garfield suit?
[383:29.37]Would you wear that for a joke?
[383:30.73]No.
[383:31.05]Thank you, Roger Cheeto, for the $1.00.
[383:33.81]Please never talk about furries.
[383:35.29]Thank you, 13th Onion, for the $1.00.
[383:39.16]Hey, Jerma, how many bits do I have to give you before you become my friend in real life?
[383:43.52]Uh, money cannot pay for friendship.
[383:46.36]I can't, I will not accept any form of payment to be a friend.
[383:50.31]How about you just fucking rip the checkbook in half and you and I are buddies already.
[383:55.35]How's that sound?
[383:57.09]Stamp that on there.
[383:59.32]But thank you.
[384:01.48]Uh, thank you, ActualDragonTears for the one dollar.
[384:04.74]I decided to make a Chinese from scratch tonight and absolutely trashed my kitchen.
[384:11.87]Tasted amazing, though.
[384:12.93]Anyways, thanks for giving me company while I cleaned my train wreck of a... What'd you make?
[384:16.05]A train wreck of a kitchen.
[384:18.99]Actual Dragon, what did you make?
[384:21.63]You're making me hungry.
[384:24.93]What'd you make?
[384:25.31]Like a... With the noodles involved?
[384:28.73]I fucking love noodles.
[384:30.85]God, I love noodles.
[384:32.83]I could eat noodles every day.
[384:35.23]Orange chicken.
[384:36.30]Ugh.
[384:40.58]Ugh.
[384:42.18]I envy you.
[384:44.06]Orange chicken is so good.
[384:45.32]It's too good.
[384:48.34]But thanks, dude.
[384:49.02]Hope it turned out well, and apparently it did, so... Thank you, Max G. Shep for the $1.
[384:54.05]Jerm, who made your fursuit?
[384:55.47]Alright, thank you.
[384:56.17]Quill Life, thanks for the $1.
[384:57.59]Any videos or big stream jokes upcoming?
[385:00.65]See you very soon.
[385:01.81]I'll see you within the next three weeks.
[385:05.86]Savior of the Dreaming Dead.
[385:07.28]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[385:08.10]I don't know if water is wet, but diamonds are unbreakable.
[385:11.72]That's a fact.
[385:13.26]Well, it depends.
[385:14.50]Diamonds are breakable if you use another diamond to break the other diamond.
[385:18.03]That's how it works.
[385:20.55]I've played Minecraft.
[385:22.23]Thank you.
[385:22.65]Apples are good for the $1.
[385:23.49]Make a bike joke.
[385:25.59]Probably did.
[385:26.19]Thanks, man.
[385:26.77]Thank you, 13th Onion, for the $1.
[385:28.51]Still on the table.
[385:31.30]Wait, what is on the table?
[385:33.26]What happened?
[385:40.72]Main channel vid?
[385:41.62]No.
[385:46.77]No main channel vids.
[385:49.61]Not in the immediate future.
[385:51.65]You'll see why.
[385:53.19]You'll see why very shortly.
[385:55.65]30 days.
[385:56.27]Less than three weeks.
[385:58.21]30 days.
[386:00.66]Thank you, Spreo, for the two bucks.
[386:02.10]Here's some more bits.
[386:03.22]I've been really loving these streams.
[386:04.28]Keep up the great work.
[386:05.04]Thank you, Spreo.
[386:09.78]Appreciate that.
[386:11.29]Swifty Bagel, thanks for the $1 valet guy for the Jerma Rumble.
[386:14.05]P.S.
[386:14.45]A car, duck law.
[386:16.55]Yes, absolutely.
[386:18.79]Logan BNTN, thanks for the $1.
[386:20.87]This job sucks.
[386:23.07]Thank you cards for the $1.
[386:24.33]Blow them up.
[386:24.77]I think they're both talking about the paramedics that came to the crime scene.
[386:31.29]Thank you, both of you, for the $1 each.
[386:34.75]Dask Kakoen, thanks for the $1.
[386:36.87]Great stream as always.
[386:37.75]Thanks for the laughs.
[386:39.39]Thank you, Dask.
[386:42.20]Glad you're laughing about it just a little bit.
[386:45.84]Thank you, dude.
[386:46.92]Grizzly1620, thanks for the $1.
[386:48.48]Also, since it seems to be a relevant topic with the game, I have a road story.
[386:53.57]On my literal first day of having my driver's license, I drove the wrong way on a one-way road.
[386:59.23]When I realized what I was doing, I almost shit myself.
[387:04.35]Yikes.
[387:05.07]That is...
[387:11.21]Gotta be careful, man.
[387:12.39]That's fucking crazy.
[387:15.05]I'm glad you're alright.
[387:16.02]Because that could turn out real bad real soon.
[387:19.82]Really quickly.
[387:21.26]But thank you for the $1, dude.
[387:22.44]Glad you're alright.
[387:24.34]Andy's Mountain, thanks for the $5.
[387:25.70]Have a great weekend, Jerma.
[387:26.78]You too, Andy.
[387:28.72]Have an even better weekend.
[387:30.86]Thank you for the $5, man.
[387:31.84]Appreciate it.
[387:32.40]The 13th Onion, thanks for the $1.
[387:33.84]Yeah, I had played $20 on 10 cent slots and made $40 profit.
[387:36.97]It's pretty fun.
[387:41.82]Yeah, you can just sit there and spin a one-cent slot machine and drink.
[387:46.88]And you'll have more fun than your buddy that lost $500 in two hours.
[387:54.85]But yeah, glad it worked out.
[387:56.93]Slots confirmed profitable.
[388:00.85]Your friend Jack says goodnight.
[388:02.25]Hey, pug ninja!
[388:05.23]Friend Jack, goodnight.
[388:07.31]Have a great night.
[388:09.20]Sir Feline, thank you for the two bucks.
[388:10.80]Always double zero, Jeremy.
[388:12.26]Party 100.
[388:16.47]Yes, that is true.
[388:20.61]Jake Sunshine, thank you again for the 1-0-0-0, the ten bucks.
[388:25.73]You were recommending Darkwood.
[388:27.85]Again, I would reiterate that I wasn't really a fan.
[388:31.08]I see the value, but I don't partake.
[388:33.54]Appreciate it.
[388:35.84]Thank you so much, sir, for the ten dollars.
[388:38.29]Lobomite, thanks for the 30 cents.
[388:39.89]Jake Sunshine, again, thank you for the 10 bucks, again.
[388:43.43]Kick that guy off his bike.
[388:47.08]I hope I tried.
[388:47.64]I hope I tried.
[388:50.08]But that's $20 total.
[388:53.26]Thank you so much, dude.
[388:55.52]Apples are good, again, for the $1.
[388:57.22]The valet driver should be in the next Jerma Rumble.
[388:59.08]Daklau, he guaranteed will be.
[389:02.28]With 99 stats.
[389:04.79]Uh, Zman, real thanks for the 25 cents.
[389:07.03]Do a facecam at the end of the stream.
[389:08.71]I can't.
[389:09.09]My facecam's not even plugged in.
[389:11.41]I am unfacecamable at the moment.
[389:14.91]Hey, Pin!
[389:15.75]Thank you, Pin, for the 25 cents.
[389:16.97]That face when Chad Jerma doesn't notice your sub.
[389:19.88]jermaPluto.
[389:22.28]I didn't?
[389:24.12]Did you resub on stream?
[389:27.56]Because if you did, then this plugin is broken.
[389:30.88]But it's supposed to catch them all that happen on stream.
[389:35.08]Thank you, Pin.
[389:37.05]Hope all is well, man.
[389:39.53]Uh, not that much left to do.
[389:40.99]Zamanreal, thanks for the 25 cents.
[389:42.49]Move to Pittsburgh.
[389:44.07]Nevada is pretty much sealed in stone.
[389:47.43]Stone is actually very breakable and easy to get rid of.
[389:49.66]Uh, it's sealed in diamond.
[389:54.16]Pretty much.
[389:56.02]Thank you, CluelessSniper, for the $1.
[389:57.60]Hey, Jerma, I have an idea for an emote.
[390:00.62]But I'm not sure if it will be allowed into the contest since it's technically three emotes.
[390:05.84]I'm just going to leave this here so I can get your thoughts.
[390:07.82]Alright, it is a triple emote that is Beanbag Sonic.
[390:13.76]And I'm immediately going to tell you why this is not going to be allowed.
[390:18.34]Because the emote itself is great.
[390:23.45]I like the three-piece here.
[390:25.47]The only problem is the third slot of that emote... Let's give you some context here.
[390:31.59]The third slot of that emote...
[390:35.05]Could be used for very, very nefarious purposes.
[390:40.09]If you don't understand what I'm talking about here... That's... That's a big no.
[390:47.98]I'm not against having a Beanbag Sonic emote, but... As I'm sure a lot of you are aware of right now... That's not gonna fly.
[390:57.48]So... We're gonna just say that's not gonna happen.
[391:02.31]Beanbag Sonic is not out of the... Not out of it.
[391:08.51]But, not as three emotes.
[391:13.71]So, yeah.
[391:16.00]It's a great, great character, though.
[391:21.40]Just the face?
[391:21.98]Maybe.
[391:27.50]I kind of have to have a beanbag Sonic emote.
[391:30.80]Understandable.
[391:33.18]I love it, though.
[391:34.06]It's fucking great.
[391:35.66]As a whole.
[391:37.22]But I don't think we... We're not gonna do more than one emote per contest entry.
[391:42.15]Because there's only gonna be, like, seven or eight emote slots, or five to... There'll be less than ten.
[391:48.91]So I wouldn't want somebody to win, like, three slots and, you know, somebody else that may have wanted a chance to have a slot.
[391:56.85]If you know what I mean.
[391:59.17]But, yuck.
[392:01.28]Thank you, though.
[392:01.76]Thank you, ClueTheSniper.
[392:02.66]Appreciate it, dude.
[392:04.10]Hope all is well.
[392:06.10]Jaredin, thanks for the $1.
[392:07.52]So, I know the stream itself has ended, but I've literally been trying to get this notice suggested for like two or three hours, so I don't care.
[392:14.21]Are you allowed to set the valet delivery to the police car?
[392:18.25]Because if so, you can get phone delivery guns on command, and that sounds super dumb and fun.
[392:25.03]That's a great suggestion.
[392:26.09]I'm going to do that.
[392:28.12]He'll just be a gun deliverer from now on.
[392:32.20]Thank you for the great tip and the 90 cents.
[392:37.34]And MooMeansMoo, thanks for the $1 spoiler alert.
[392:39.80]This show was self-contained and didn't really need a second season.
[392:43.09]Additions to the story feel forced.
[392:44.79]Just my opinion.
[392:45.71]Wow, you fucking ruined the whole thing.
[392:49.07]What a bastard.
[392:50.29]Thank you, Garfield the Monday Killer for the 25 cents.
[392:53.41]Garfield on the town.
[392:54.43]I'm going to be making the big move soon, and I'm making the final goodbyes to all my pals.
[392:58.52]It'll feel weird leaving the old stomping grounds without the gang.
[393:02.14]But I heard Opus the Penguin will be there.
[393:04.40]Never met him, but he seems nice.
[393:05.70]Thanks for the advice on keeping in contact with old friends because they think you're a handsome genius.
[393:09.39]No joke, they think you're buff as heck.
[393:11.41]Also, how do you feel about the new Muppet reboot?
[393:17.69]The new Muppet reboot.
[393:19.47]You mean, the one with Jason Statham?
[393:21.89]No, Jason, what's his name?
[393:22.99]Jason Voorhees.
[393:23.83]No, Jason... Uh, Jason... Jason Sudeikis.
[393:29.48]No, what is his fucking name?
[393:30.62]The guy that... Mad About You.
[393:32.98]No, uh, the guy with the umbrella lady.
[393:35.68]I'm gonna tell you the story of how I met your mother.
[393:37.94]How I met your mother.
[393:38.60]What's her name?
[393:39.50]What's his name?
[393:40.28]After I met your mother, the guy that met his mother... No, not the guy that met his mother.
[393:43.96]The guy that was friends with the guy that met his mother.
[393:49.90]Jason Segel!
[393:50.74]Thank you.
[393:53.56]Jason Segel.
[393:57.86]I like that one.
[393:58.50]That one was pretty good.
[394:03.72]I mean, Disney bought the Muppets, so you have to imagine they're going to be making a bunch of movies.
[394:10.39]But yeah, that's how I feel.
[394:11.99]Cool.
[394:13.33]Muppets Take Manhattan is one of the best movies ever, so, I mean, come on.
[394:19.17]I don't think I could be... I couldn't justify singing such an incredible song.
[394:29.13]A true piece of artwork that needs to be... Congress needs to put it in the library of things to protect.
[394:38.31]Important art pieces that which we should protect.
[394:41.15]In quotes.
[394:42.17]Whatever it's called.
[394:42.79]The Library of Congress.
[394:45.69]Hey, Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[394:48.66]That's it.

[395:10.47]Acron.
[395:11.99]I don't know what that is.
[395:13.45]I'm going to fucking Nevada, man.
[395:16.47]Nevada.
[395:20.59]It's going to be fun.
[395:21.87]Dr. Clay, thanks for the 25 cents.
[395:23.55]Again.
[395:25.70]Lots of bits from you, man.
[395:27.14]Thanks a lot.
[395:29.13]I'm gonna be sad when the true crime in the streets, Hong Kong, and the sheets is over.
[395:33.53]I really enjoyed the whole series from LA and the New York good times.
[395:36.11]Fun fact, when you played Streets of LA, I subscribed to you for the first time on Twitch.
[395:40.94]I'll always remember that guy who said, I'm gonna kill your ass.
[395:44.18]Burp.
[395:46.54]That was one of the funniest things I've ever seen.
[395:49.70]It is sad that we're coming to a close for the true crime series.
[395:53.88]Because they are some of the most fun...
[395:56.81]Just, like, kind of outrageous, but not intentionally outrageous games I've ever played, so.
[396:04.41]Yeah, it is a sad day.
[396:06.07]Only got, like, probably one more stream of true crime ever.
[396:10.40]But don't worry.
[396:10.94]There's plenty more coming.
[396:14.52]Moo means moo, thanks for the $1.
[396:15.84]Coney Island.
[396:16.54]They called Coney Island the playground of the world.
[396:19.40]And we used to sleep on the beach overnight.
[396:21.24]They don't do that anymore.
[396:22.30]Things have changed, you see.
[396:23.39]They don't sleep anymore on the beach.

[398:12.99]Jesse the Chicken Nugget for the $1.
[398:16.93]Hey Jerma, thanks for all the laughs.
[398:17.97]I was wondering if you ever heard of Mercenaries Playground of Destruction.
[398:22.07]And if you would ever stream it.
[398:23.55]Have a fantastic night, and thanks for all you do.
[398:27.45]Uh, yes.
[398:28.59]I actually was going to make a video on mercenaries years ago.
[398:32.13]But for some reason, I had problems capturing it.
[398:36.17]So, I'm definitely down to play it.
[398:40.23]I did try a long time ago.
[398:41.79]It might be a headache to capture now, but I'll try.
[398:45.23]Put it on the list.
[398:46.07]Get it on the list in Discord.
[398:49.41]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[398:51.16]They say Bork.
[398:52.52]That's right, thank you.
[398:53.42]Zeman Real, thanks for the 25 cents.
[398:54.88]Move to Detroit.
[398:57.18]Uh, no, I want to move west, west coast.
[398:59.94]And finally, at the very end here, Garfield the Monday Killer for 25 cents.
[399:03.22]Sorry, Odie got a hold of my keyboard and that's kind of all he says.
[399:06.00]Oh, oh, oh.
[399:07.04]He said he was doing his best Swedish chef impression.
[399:09.78]Now he's asking you to do an impression of your favorite Muppet.
[399:12.64]If not, he'll settle for a Beaker impression.
[399:14.90]Also, you're the 935th place streamer.
[399:15.94]Three places higher.
[399:20.25]You see that?
[399:21.73]In two weeks.
[399:23.05]In two weeks, we go from 938 to 935.
[399:26.84]Give me another two weeks.
[399:29.36]We'll be at 932.
[399:29.88]And eventually, 17 years from now, with that pace, we'll be number one.
[399:39.29]Thanks, dude.
[399:40.13]Hey, Tingy, thanks for the 25 cents.
[399:41.55]You thought that was the last cheer, but really, it was mine.

[399:55.59]I got the Dreamcast sitting right behind me, man.
[399:57.19]I promise.
[400:00.43]And with that, we're going to clean up Sleeping Dogs over the weekend.
[400:05.91]I don't know when.
[400:07.17]I'm going to throw it in there at some point.
[400:08.63]This is not going to be one of those situations where I go, you know, there might be a stream over the next few days.
[400:14.34]No, it's going to happen.
[400:15.36]I just don't know when.
[400:16.42]So, Garen fucking Tito, 100% Jeremy Elbertson guarantee.
[400:22.83]There will be another Sleeping Dogs stream before Tuesday.

[400:45.07]So there's a 35% chance.
[400:47.80]Don't you know?
[400:48.24]A Jerma guarantee is like 40% chance.
