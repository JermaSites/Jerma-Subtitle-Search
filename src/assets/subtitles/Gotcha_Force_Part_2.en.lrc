[00:01.38]Hey.
[00:04.76]How you doing?
[00:05.70]Welcome, everybody.
[00:07.52]Welcome back to... Live.
[00:10.61]I just pressed the button and ran downstairs and grabbed water.
[00:20.53]Let me make a tweet.
[00:21.63]We can start playing more Gotcha Force.
[00:24.65]I'm pretty into it.
[00:25.35]I want to collect more fucking robots.
[00:33.48]No!
[00:35.04]Oh, stupid trapeze simulator.
[00:38.30]I didn't even... Okay, I'm going to be honest.
[00:39.76]I forgot.
[00:43.04]I completely didn't even... I forgot everything.
[00:48.70]I hit the stop streaming button and instantly it deleted from my brain.
[00:55.36]So what are you talking about?
[00:59.71]Can you guys... Somebody be specific with me.
[01:07.81]Like, is there a certain website?
[01:10.07]Is it on Steam?
[01:11.66]Or is it a... Are you serious?
[01:22.52]What?
[01:26.08]It's on Reddit.
[01:27.07]Trapeze Simulator Reddit.
[01:31.47]Okay, the number one...
[01:34.74]Okay, when I type in Trapeze Simulator Reddit, the first search is Jerma promises to do Trapeze Simulator.
[01:48.21]What is this?
[01:48.75]Okay, let me just go to this.
[01:54.57]Jerma promises to do Trapeze Simulator.
[01:56.39]Okay, so what is it?
[02:01.29]When I type in Trapeze Simulator...
[02:08.00]There's nothing here.
[02:08.70]It's just... I'm the third result.
[02:12.18]When you type in Trapeze Simulator, I'm the third.
[02:14.70]That exact thing is the third result.
[02:17.71]And then there's this rail simulation.
[02:21.79]It's like an EU.
[02:27.25]Right here.
[02:30.98]This is not even fucking real.
[02:32.40]Okay, is this...
[02:34.55]Well, alright.
[02:35.21]Excuse me for thinking it was real.
[02:38.51]Like, this game has released 500 times.
[02:42.92]As different things.
[02:44.02]Different objects.
[02:45.40]So, how would I know this was fake?
[02:50.56]Replace the word trapeze with another weird, hard to hold onto object.
[02:55.75]And that game has been made.
[03:00.51]Anyways, I gotta tweet that.
[03:40.01]Okay, also I have something to tell you.
[03:43.54]Yesterday we talked about this a little bit, but I'll give you a little bit more details.
[03:46.14]There's a few things to talk about here.
[03:51.06]Things to talk about, number one, they may even be showing themselves right now.
[03:55.27]We do have some new mods.
[03:57.83]As of right now, I believe there are three new mods.
[04:00.85]I'm going through the process of adding mods.
[04:04.51]Mod Apocalypse.
[04:08.09]Four, that's right, yeah, four.
[04:10.31]Four, there are four new mods.
[04:12.19]I did this yesterday, and I don't even know.
[04:15.78]Uh, so we got, there can be a lot more of a presence.
[04:21.12]They'll catch you.
[04:23.51]Oh, no mods!
[04:24.55]Nope, they'll catch you now.
[04:29.49]Also, on top of that, welcome them.
[04:31.33]There has been a process to bring some more on.
[04:35.67]And we're not quite done.
[04:38.31]Still some people would think we're going to be bringing on two.
[04:42.48]Besides that, also, I'm pleased to announce to you right now that, um... On... Okay.
[04:55.83]On... You ready?
[04:57.87]Okay.
[04:59.38]On May 15th and May 16th.
[05:07.31]Easy Bake Oven stream and green screen DLC for free back-to-back.
[05:10.17]A couple weeks from now.
[05:18.72]It has been confirmed.
[05:20.50]It has been locked in.
[05:28.20]That's my birthday.
[05:30.11]I can't wait to do like a special birthday thing in front of the green screen.
[05:34.99]Why?
[05:35.69]That's a suggestion, right?
[05:36.53]Is it a suggestion?
[05:38.52]To like come in and it's your birthday and I'm like here for your birthday and I sit down and I enjoy your birthday.
[05:45.76]I mean, I have to give you everything possible.
[05:48.52]Like, oh, I wish Jerma was at my birthday.
[05:51.12]I'm going to green screen myself celebrating your birthday and singing and stuff.
[05:56.41]I'll open my mouth in a weird way, so you can literally just put any name there.
[06:03.65]I'll be like, hey, and open my mouth.
[06:05.59]Steve.
[06:05.77]You can do whatever you want.
[06:10.36]Parasocial relationship.
[06:19.12]I was going to record myself just pretending to be your friend for like three hours.
[06:26.56]We're going to sit in your room together, we're going to watch TV.
[06:30.18]How about this?
[06:31.08]I will green screen myself reacting to the entire Witcher Netflix series.
[06:37.79]It'll just be keyed.
[06:39.99]It'll just be me reacting off screen.
[06:41.55]You can queue it up.
[06:43.01]So then it could be like, I'm sitting there, hanging out, just keyed into your living room while we watch The Witcher's entire sequence together.
[06:56.76]How fucked up would that be?
[06:59.54]Rift tracks?
[07:00.16]No, no, no, no, no.
[07:00.72]It would just be me just hanging out in your living room with you.
[07:04.52]We're just watching The Witcher on Netflix.
[07:12.41]That's probably a bad idea.
[07:17.77]Wow, that's a really hard TV show.
[07:20.03]Are you making a joke and a reference that The Witcher 3 is a bad game or something?
[07:23.89]This is not a joke.
[07:25.03]Do not stop.
[07:27.25]What is this?
[07:28.43]You will be kissed by a love of life if you repost this four times and stream Lego Lord of the Rings.
[07:40.15]Alright.
[07:40.95]Let's play.
[07:42.35]Let's play.
[07:43.89]New mods?
[07:45.05]Shut it down.
[07:46.79]Hey, we got four new mods.
[07:48.47]Hey, shut it down.
[07:55.56]Hey, those new blades need to be used, right?
[07:58.70]They're brand new.
[07:59.40]They just came out of the blacksmith.
[08:00.54]Those swords, they haven't been touched.
[08:05.23]There's still... Those new swords... Come on.
[08:11.21]VRJosh.
[08:12.55]You haven't even peeled the plastic off yours yet.
[08:14.19]Come on.
[08:14.97]Come on, let's go.
[08:16.65]Use them.
[08:18.57]I know, but I want to leave the plastic on as long as I can because I want it to be new and I want to just take the peel... peel the plastic off.
[08:31.67]VRJosh left.
[08:32.45]Oh, well, okay.
[08:35.77]Oh, oh, okay.
[08:36.77]Oh, I see.
[08:37.17]Oh, oh, I see how it is.
[08:38.17]Alright, let's play.
[08:44.51]Welcome back, everybody.
[08:50.31]That was vehicle barrier.
[08:51.47]Yeah, I can't help it.
[08:55.32]He got it from me.
[08:57.09]You know, we hang out so often that, you know, the other way around, what do you mean?
[09:03.33]We hang out so often that, like, I just kind of do some of his things.
[09:07.13]I got it from him.
[09:11.37]Cool desk.
[09:12.27]Thanks.
[09:13.98]Wait, what's on this desk?
[09:14.92]There's a GameCube.
[09:18.26]There's a TV changer beeper.
[09:22.37]Two GameCube controllers.
[09:24.99]Block.
[09:25.97]Eh, that's kind of a boring desk, actually.
[09:28.05]No, I don't want to do versus.
[09:33.29]I'd say that's so cool that you could do that, though.
[09:44.89]This eraser is kind of pogged, though, yeah.
[09:47.85]Veto the game?
[09:48.97]No.
[09:49.95]It's not going to happen.
[09:54.50]It's not gonna happen.

[10:38.40]I am not.
[10:42.96]Can you?
[10:43.74]Alright.
[10:44.02]I'm sort of green.
[10:45.10]Alright.
[10:45.36]I'm just going to green screen myself playing all of Lisa, the painful.
[10:51.76]And like, you can just sit in your living room and we'll play together.
[10:57.02]It's going to be a long green screen stream.
[10:59.60]It's going to be like 12 days long.
[11:01.24]Okay.
[11:03.22]Let's go.
[11:09.46]Who do I want for support?
[11:12.73]Nana.
[11:19.21]Why do that when you can just play it?
[11:20.83]Because I want to be in your living room.
[11:23.85]I want to be in your living room.
[11:27.69]Hold on, I gotta get this right.
[11:32.17]It's Jerma in your living room.

[12:24.90]No, that's I'm not doing this
[12:29.98]By the way, this character is so much better now.
[12:33.96]It's unbelievable how much better he is.
[12:45.03]I missed bits.
[12:46.15]Big bits.
[12:47.63]Big bits.
[12:49.13]Yeah, you're right.
[12:49.59]$5,000.
[12:49.61]$50. $50.
[12:54.45]From PhylacteryLich.
[12:55.39]That's a huge amount of money.
[12:56.35]Thank you, again, for, like, essentially what has turned into about $50 a day.
[13:02.62]Or a stream.
[13:04.22]It's insane.
[13:06.94]You're insane.
[13:08.12]It's so much money.
[13:10.10]I can't even believe you still give me this much money.
[13:12.48]Thank you.
[13:13.22]It's crazy.
[13:14.26]I can't even believe it.
[13:21.05]They say, don't you ever stop playing Gacha Force.
[13:23.65]If you haven't figured it out, the yellow icons on the map are side missions and the orange ones are important.
[13:28.18]I'm not gonna, no.
[13:30.92]I like this game.
[13:32.72]And I'm gonna play it.
[13:34.52]I ain't gonna get Beautiful Joe bullied out of this one.
[13:37.78]Nope.
[13:38.42]Because Beautiful Joe was like $11 and this one was $250.
[13:43.56]I ain't gonna get bullied out of this one.
[13:45.94]Nope.
[13:46.50]Not a chance.
[13:47.26]Not a chance in hell.
[13:53.27]And this is one of my favorite GameCube games.
[13:56.19]No way.
[13:56.67]I'm going to beat the shit out of this game.
[14:07.70]He loves this game.
[14:08.82]I do.
[14:09.46]It's just fun to play.
[14:10.86]And that's what matters.
[14:13.36]Are you having fun playing?
[14:16.86]Don't worry.
[14:17.34]I'm going to record a green screen for every game you've ever wanted me to fucking play in your living room with you.
[14:23.31]I don't even need to stream anymore.
[14:25.13]I'm just going to green screen myself playing the entire Steam library.
[14:30.33]And I'll make a bot that's able to replace every name with your name.
[14:35.20]You just put it in.
[14:36.20]And anytime your name comes up, it's me addressing you.
[14:42.14]And I'll charge a modest fee for each video game hangout in your living room session.
[14:47.77]I don't know, like 50 cents.
[14:54.50]That's a good idea.
[14:56.04]That would be so... Why not just a live stream?
[15:02.36]50 cents.
[15:03.22]Yeah, you know, what you do is you call my 1-900 number I'm gonna set up.
[15:07.88]Which is $1.80 a minute.
[15:10.98]And it's me in your living room on your phone.
[15:14.52]Holy shit, nice.
[15:15.68]Teleport, ninja.
[15:22.28]Sex line.
[15:27.31]Alright, can you imagine?
[15:28.47]Let's just briefly go over this.
[15:31.51]Back when it was like four or five dollars a minute.
[15:36.04]Holy shit.
[15:38.90]Can you imagine sitting on that phone for more than 10 to 20 minutes?
[15:46.54]That's absurd.
[15:47.20]That's expensive.
[15:58.99]It would cost me $2.
[16:05.33]I'm so glad that I have turned on the mature content filter for the channel.
[16:14.09]Very necessary at this point, I think.
[16:19.56]Uh, who's the new, new guy?
[16:23.36]Ooh.
[16:27.16]Arm Cutter.
[16:28.06]Double Kamaitachi.
[16:30.74]And then Ninpo Teleport.
[16:32.32]And then Teleport Slash.
[16:33.45]Teleport's a fun one to say.
[16:35.19]That's a radio word.
[16:36.61]Teleport.
[16:37.55]Teleporting.
[16:38.43]Teleport.
[16:38.81]Teleport.
[16:39.21]It's because of the E and the L and the E. Teleport.
[16:44.69]It's like saying W. W's a fun one to say too.
[16:47.65]And even with a lot of consonants in the middle.
[16:49.57]They're a lot of fun.
[16:51.73]www.teleport.com Yeah, that was fun.
[16:55.63]That was fun to do.
[16:57.97]Infuse his enemies with his smooth moves.
[17:01.55]Use the Ninpo teleport while moving to throw them off.
[17:05.03]Descent.
[17:06.37]And wait for your chance and hit them with the teleport slash.
[17:13.08]Oh, I'll try it.
[17:13.82]He's expensive though.
[17:14.58]He's 400.
[17:14.74]What can I get rid of?
[17:20.12]Eh.
[17:21.24]I gotta clean up my toy shelf.
[17:22.62]This is bothering me.
[17:29.64]And afford anything else.
[17:34.25]I gotta clean up my Reddit.
[17:35.37]I was gonna call it my Reddit shelf in the title.
[17:40.39]But that's just dumping more charcoals onto this fire.
[17:42.89]I'm... No.
[17:44.07]I could've.
[17:50.10]But that's just me embracing the fact that that's what that is.
[17:52.96]And I kinda don't wanna do that.
[18:01.14]Choke on the joke.
[18:02.98]Choke on the joke smoke.
[18:07.50]What?
[18:08.00]I like this guy.
[18:10.10]I like the little wing thing.
[18:13.26]What does this one do?
[18:14.40]Oh, shit.
[18:15.06]Is that like just... You just don't get hurt?
[18:18.14]How does that work?
[18:20.38]Wait, you can charge it.
[18:24.48]Oh, uh...
[18:34.44]It's okay.
[18:36.08]It's just you phase out.
[18:37.04]Does it hurt?
[18:43.02]If I get in there, is it going to be... Hard to use.
[18:47.16]Play Minesweeper.
[18:47.98]This game sucks.
[18:49.04]Sorry.
[18:49.66]Minesweeper is not a... Minesweeper.
[18:52.02]Minesweeper.
[18:52.66]Not enough consonants in there.
[18:54.32]I don't like that one.
[18:56.18]Sorry.
[18:56.32]Sorry.
[19:04.74]Oh, fuck.
[19:05.98]Yeah, this guy's not very good.
[19:07.14]Maybe you like him.
[19:12.92]What about his melee?
[19:15.82]Wasn't a bunch of flying people.
[19:23.72]Oh, that guy sucks.
[19:24.51]He's $400.
[19:25.05]Look at how much better this dude is.
[19:30.75]And he's like, he's $500, but still.
[19:35.88]It's so much better.
[19:41.66]Omega Lull 400 or Omega Lulls.
[19:43.78]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[19:53.97]Where is it?
[19:56.75]Do it, do it, do it, do it.
[19:59.37]There's more huge money coming.
[20:00.81]Hold on.
[20:02.27]Huge money.
[20:08.70]Is this on the Commodore?
[20:09.56]Uh, no.
[20:12.12]This is on the Nintendo GameCube.
[20:19.14]Just trying to level up my crew.
[20:21.92]So I can do the secret mission.
[20:23.18]The Nintendo ShipCube.
[20:32.51]Wow.
[20:33.93]That was clever.
[20:34.57]That was a clever one.
[20:43.30]Oh, that was satisfying, but it didn't hit.
[20:45.82]Come on!
[20:54.57]Someone stop him.
[20:59.63]Stop what?
[21:05.62]Uh, thank you, somebody, uh, Fairykun gave $50.
[21:11.77]5,000 bits.
[21:13.87]Another $50 drop.
[21:15.11]They say, hey, Jermbo, I'm not sure if you saw, but the Pentagon released a video showing unidentified aerial phenomenon.
[21:22.75]That's a good one to say, too.
[21:23.85]Unidentified aerial phenomenon.
[21:25.81]Thanks for giving me one of those cool ones.
[21:27.71]Which basically just means UFO, and I really want to rant about UFOs and aliens from my fellow Redditor.
[21:36.61]Um... Well... I mean, is it weird to think that because you have a flat screen TV that aliens had to have existed?
[21:48.03]Alright, like... We went from, like, putting corn in the ground to being able to talk to people through, like, a piece of plastic and they can hear you 7,000 miles away.
[22:04.08]That's alien fucking technology.
[22:08.09]It has to be.
[22:10.87]Ooh, a magnet robot minus.
[22:19.49]Somebody just wrote in all capitals.
[22:21.61]True.
[22:26.96]Oh, come on.
[22:27.44]Not another normal night.
[22:28.44]Give me like a pro night.
[22:30.52]Give me like a hard mode night.
[22:32.20]Give me an insane night.
[22:47.06]Wasn't this the minus?
[22:47.92]Alright, do I make like a comedy team?
[22:53.25]Do I make like a plus and minus team?
[22:55.57]Alright, well, what's the difference?
[23:02.04]Magnet scope, magnet arm, and beam.
[23:03.76]Okay.
[23:03.88]Okay.
[23:07.47]Magnet Robot Minus was created by the Natural Resources Unit.
[23:11.33]His magnet scope enables him to collect materials like... Yeah, the Pokémon from mines.
[23:16.45]His beam is used to modify collectible... So what's the difference?
[23:24.32]Why are you $10 more expensive to use?
[23:28.19]Oh, I'm sorry.
[23:28.85]Why do you cost 10 more battery?
[23:35.22]I mean, I'll try.
[23:35.98]I'll try everything once.
[23:38.30]Each character gets one chance to impress me.
[23:41.78]Otherwise, they're going right into fucking recycling.
[23:46.95]I gotta clean this up.
[23:48.63]This looks like shit.
[23:53.21]Alright, let's, uh... That's fine.
[23:57.32]The name is Dumas.
[23:59.34]But, FairyCon, thanks for the $50 and the interesting thought project about aliens.
[24:09.32]Yes, I do believe that... I think there has to be aliens somewhere.
[24:17.83]There has to be.
[24:27.53]Alright, you're telling me if we're supposed to be if we're supposed to be some kind of Alright, we're gonna get a little philosophical here So if if like god created man and god created Earth, whatever Don't you think you made probably like fucking a hundred of these?
[24:42.04]Why would you make just one?
[24:45.24]If you had the power to why wouldn't you just make like a hundred?
[24:47.42]How would you make one?
[24:53.32]Or if you were like a group of aliens that were like, you know what?
[24:55.22]Let's fucking, let's blow something up and make a bunch of cells.
[24:59.01]You would do that like a thousand times, wouldn't you?
[25:04.77]How do I ban you?
[25:05.59]What?
[25:05.81]I'm just, I'm just talking, I'm just, this is a thought project.
[25:08.77]This is, I didn't say, by the way, this is everything I believe.
[25:11.27]This is a thought, I said, quote, thought project before we started.
[25:13.89]I don't know, if you were God, and you made this like cool, like, if you made like water...
[25:23.60]And you built like this puzzle that is land on Earth and shit.
[25:28.29]You made like dinosaurs and monsters and aliens.
[25:30.84]What, you just get it done?
[25:34.40]No.
[25:35.26]You would do that like a bunch of times.
[25:36.96]Like, oh, that one was fun.
[25:38.90]Those of you art people here, would you paint one fucking picture?
[25:43.16]Would you make one painting and go, that's it.
[25:45.48]That's the best one.
[25:46.27]That's the only one I'm going to do.
[25:47.85]I'll never make another painting in my whole life.
[25:50.53]It's the best.
[25:51.13]I'll never, I'll never pick up tools again.
[25:55.79]Oh, you would just draw.
[25:56.95]You'd create.
[25:57.63]You would make.
[25:58.33]You would create.
[26:02.62]Like, do you know what I think God has in his office?
[26:05.18]Just a hanging picture of Earth.
[26:08.36]And he's the annoying, what, people come over and he's like, yeah, I drew that, I made that 5,000 years ago.
[26:13.25]Nice, yeah, you tell us every time.
[26:16.61]Yeah.
[26:19.63]And his whole house is just covered in, like, Earth memorabilia.
[26:24.43]No, you would have, you would do this millions of times.
[26:27.11]If you had the power to, like, point your finger and, like, and there's a fucking giraffe!
[26:32.19]You know how many characters I made in Spore?
[26:36.03]How many hours did you spend in Spore?
[26:37.63]Well, I guess it probably took a long time.
[26:38.96]No, it took like, it looks like seven days to make Earth.
[26:42.02]No way, I spent at least like 25 days playing Spore.
[26:46.58]There's no way.
[26:47.02]Just telling you, like, if we're an experiment, people are like, wait, we might be in a simulation.
[26:59.46]I don't know.
[27:04.91]be the creationist no I'm just saying like this probably a bunch of like earths potentially but I don't know if you were god wouldn't you make like Earth again but just make people have no noses just because you that's just I decided to take their noses off this time on Earth six trillion how many of you guys that are art people here because I mean I'm one of you
[27:27.69]Okay, I come from a video editing standpoint on this.
[27:31.13]You know how many times I've cut shit out and redone the whole thing?
[27:37.76]We're probably not supposed to have hands.
[27:40.88]That was like a first draft.
[27:43.56]And then God's looking down going, holy shit, yeah, I remember that.
[27:46.33]It was my first painting there.
[27:47.69]And look at the way they made their fucking hands.
[27:50.45]Whoa.
[27:51.77]That was so wrong.
[27:54.03]I've improved so much.
[27:56.45]On Earth 2 million.
[28:11.59]We are the first draft.
[28:17.01]Okay, somebody said we are the first draft and then a sad face.
[28:24.02]This guy's actually pretty good.
[28:27.26]I actually kind of like this.
[28:28.04]I like the beam.
[28:31.06]I like the beams.
[28:32.84]They're quality.
[28:35.65]I can see why you're worth 10 more battery points.
[28:48.88]You're permanently on the team.
[28:51.48]Why would you not be?
[28:57.45]If this is right, then why doesn't God appear and yell to you that what I'm saying is right?
[29:03.73]Do me a favor.
[29:05.18]Yell to your Sims.
[29:07.96]They're not going to respond to you.
[29:11.08]How come in The Sims 4 when you go, Hey!
[29:13.18]Hey, Julie!
[29:14.18]Julie, look at me!
[29:14.90]I'm up here!
[29:15.44]Did he fucking hear you?
[29:20.27]You'll pay for this!
[29:21.77]I'm not talking to you anymore.
[29:31.85]my Sims talk to me sim but Sims are not real but uh we will but how can you be so certain that we will
[30:13.60]Let me see who that was.
[30:15.62]Ooh, finally, I got a healer.
[30:20.24]Turn him off, turn him off.
[30:21.10]Oh yeah, we get big bits.
[30:22.12]I get it, hold on.
[30:23.88]Oh, we did.
[30:25.22]Phylactery, again, gave $50.
[30:30.29]$50.
[30:30.31]5,000 more bits from Phylactery, which brings it to $100 in bits today, right now.
[30:36.27]He said, Jerma, don't let Jerma's alien rant distract you from the fact that he owns and wears a crystal healing bracelet.
[30:47.87]I don't wear... I don't.
[30:51.83]I don't wear a crystal healing bracelet.
[30:53.59]Oh, look.
[30:56.05]I got... I have a little bit of... Look.
[30:58.37]I have... Listen.
[30:59.81]Listen to me.
[31:00.19]Look.
[31:01.17]Look.
[31:01.67]I have a little bit of black tourmaline.
[31:05.10]Because I thought it was cool, not because I think it has magical powers.
[31:08.62]And I paired that with some quartz to, uh, clean my blood and, uh, sift my, uh, through my kidneys and make me have cleaner pee or something.
[31:19.43]I don't know.
[31:20.29]It was interesting.
[31:21.37]It's interesting.
[31:22.19]I don't care.
[31:22.79]I don't think it, I don't think it's real.
[31:24.56]I don't think it's real.
[31:26.32]Look, okay, let me preface it again.
[31:28.50]I don't think that's real.
[31:29.88]It's just an interesting thought project.
[31:34.94]It's a thought project.
[31:39.61]Why'd you do it then?
[31:41.85]Why do people wear fucking, like... Why do people wear rings and bracelets?
[31:48.25]I don't know, because they, like, it's an accessory.
[31:50.89]But I can't have an accessory?
[31:52.49]I don't think my accessories have magical powers.
[31:56.01]I just liked the idea of having, like, a little accessory.
[31:58.86]And, like, the black tourmaline looked... It shined well, and it was polished...
[32:09.19]Don't people believe, doesn't believe, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[32:11.81]Doesn't believe in God, but believes in healing crystals.
[32:18.24]I don't.
[32:21.14]I don't believe in healing crystals.
[32:24.30]I, I believe, I believe in like medicine and science.
[32:29.68]Alright.
[32:30.22]Let's, let me, let's be clear.
[32:31.94]I believe in medical science.
[32:35.69]Okay.
[32:36.77]Do I have to say that?
[32:43.01]Now he's a Redditor.
[32:43.69]That's a Redditor comment.
[32:45.79]Medical doctors.
[32:53.08]Oh, he's so enlightened.
[32:55.10]Why is me saying that I believe in medicine of like an enlightened Redditor?
[33:04.78]Are you guys like smearing garlic in your assholes?
[33:07.84]What are you talking about?
[33:21.98]Thank God I put that mature content filter on.
[33:25.66]Seems like I'm getting a lot of... A lot of mileage out of that one.
[33:34.04]I don't... The healer is... No.
[33:36.08]Crashed here.
[33:40.48]Crashed.
[33:41.56]Alright.
[33:42.20]It's time for me to...
[33:53.48]Uh, Bitslave.

[34:06.07]5,000 more bits.
[34:09.13]What's up, Jerma?
[34:09.81]Bitslave here.
[34:11.35]I'm currently trying to pass two kidney stones at the moment.
[34:13.75]Very painful.
[34:15.25]I also recently got my League of Legends account permabanned.
[34:19.53]Stop playing.
[34:21.15]Stop playing.
[34:21.67]Just start reading books.
[34:23.75]You know what I mean?
[34:24.21]Like, every time you have the urge to play League, just read, like, two chapters of a book or something.
[34:31.38]It's too stressful.
[34:32.70]And it's gonna make you mad and angry at stuff.
[34:34.72]Uh, it caused me worse pain than my stones.
[34:40.06]Not because of the ban.
[34:41.78]Because of this.
[34:42.38]Ooh.
[34:44.73]Ooh.
[34:47.35]How much money have I spent in League of Legends?
[34:51.38]Here's how much you've spent in League of Legends.
[34:54.66]Oh.
[34:55.82]Damn, that's a lot of money.
[34:58.59]Damn, that's a lot of money.
[34:59.89]Do you want me to share this?
[35:01.53]That's a lot of money.
[35:02.37]Play Billy the Egg, by the way.
[35:03.59]I will.
[35:06.58]That's a lot.
[35:15.05]Damn.
[35:16.19]Alright, well this makes me feel better about how many card packs I bought in Hearthstone.
[35:19.45]You don't have any, like, there's no, like, personal info on here, right?
[35:27.46]Alright, here.
[35:33.34]We're gonna do a big reveal.
[35:35.60]They said share it.
[35:55.08]damn that's a lot that's a lot and now you're well take that as a damn that's a lot of money uh hey it's alright it's it's just it's don't worry about it it's all good but don't go back let's put it this way don't go back
[36:22.50]You know what game you can play that's free?
[36:25.20]Doesn't cost anything.
[36:27.24]It's completely free.
[36:30.67]Kickball.
[36:32.75]It's free.
[36:33.49]Well, it's not.
[36:33.91]You're gonna buy the ball.
[36:35.35]Those are like probably $5.
[36:42.28]It's fun.
[36:42.90]It's like a combination of soccer and baseball.
[36:47.37]Just be careful, because although the ball is very, very... It bounces easily, and it's like a big bouncy ball, and it makes a cool sound.
[36:54.73]I know the sound is awesome.
[36:56.09]But just be careful.
[36:56.83]I've seen plenty of pitchers, especially teachers, that used to be the pitcher, because I know that everyone was concerned about this.
[37:03.59]The teachers would always be the pitcher, because some kids kicked it way too hard, and boom, boom, right into the teacher's face.
[37:10.24]Just be careful.
[37:11.52]You've got to stand back.
[37:14.83]It happened at least three or four times to me growing up.
[37:20.25]And their glasses.
[37:21.55]They had spent a bunch of time with their glasses, putting their glasses back on.
[37:24.41]It's like, holy shit.
[37:26.44]This got rocked.
[37:29.02]Just be careful.
[37:29.62]It could be dangerous.
[37:30.92]But it's fun.
[37:34.82]I'm supposed to be playing a game.
[37:41.18]Thanks for the 5,000 bits.
[37:48.27]Remember, it was a delinquent.
[37:49.79]What?
[37:50.23]No.
[38:01.02]We want more rants.
[38:11.97]More rants.
[38:15.11]No, I don't even know.
[38:16.07]I'm not even ranting.
[38:18.38]I'm doing Thought Project.
[38:33.28]That's such a Redditor thing.
[38:34.76]How do I kill this thing?
[38:37.65]How do I bury this Redditor thing?
[38:43.69]How do I do that?
[38:45.29]I know.
[38:46.37]I have to have something else even more ridiculous and embarrassing happen so that you forget about the Redditor thing.
[38:52.12]Okay.
[38:59.78]Hmm.
[39:02.60]I'm going to, like, take a picture of... I'm going to have, like, a picture of... I'm going to turn the camera on one day and my mouth is going to be full of, like, hot dogs and, like, marshmallows and I'm going to be like...
[39:12.34]And I'm gonna be like, I'm the Marshmallow Man!
[39:14.10]I'm the Marshmallow Man!
[39:14.82]And people are gonna be like, holy shit, he's fucking crazy.
[39:16.74]And then that'll be all you talk about for like six months.
[39:23.14]Perfect.
[39:28.33]He's a 12-year-old.
[39:32.79]Dude, I love this guy.
[39:33.67]He's got a sick move.
[39:46.93]Tom Green.
[39:57.21]I have hot dogs in my mouth.
[39:58.35]I'm a hot dog man.
[39:59.65]I have marshmallows in my mouth.
[40:00.77]I'm a marshmallow man.
[40:02.04]I'm a marshmallow man.
[40:03.06]I'm a marshmallow man.
[40:04.06]I'm a marshmallow man.
[40:06.12]I'm a marshmallow man.
[40:07.16]Yeah.
[40:08.10]I mean, that's funny.
[40:08.90]It was funny.
[40:09.94]It's kind of funny.
[40:16.82]I'll tell you the absolute best thing that I've ever seen Tom Green do.
[40:22.17]He did a show back on MTV.
[40:23.97]He was like a weird, wild guy.
[40:25.31]He did all kinds of crazy shit.
[40:26.69]But this is my favorite thing that he ever did.
[40:30.69]Not like, wow, remember when he went and he smashed the calculator?
[40:33.28]Remember when he peed his pants?
[40:35.24]No, no, no.
[40:36.24]He's sitting on a bench next to this old woman who's holding a cup.
[40:39.92]You can't see what's in the cup.
[40:41.58]And he continuously is interviewing this old woman.
[40:45.48]And he goes, hey, I'm sitting here enjoying a nice Mountain Dew.
[40:49.87]And she's like, yeah, it's just a water.
[40:52.95]And she starts laughing.
[40:53.85]And he's like, oh, well, I mean, I'm sitting here.
[40:56.23]You're having a great time.
[40:57.27]We're hanging out on this bench.
[40:58.05]You're enjoying your Mountain Dew.
[41:00.21]And she's like, it's a water.
[41:03.19]This is a water.
[41:04.69]And he's like, oh, wow, what a refreshing Mountain Dew.
[41:08.03]Seriously, I thought it was the funniest thing ever.
[41:13.95]I thought it was really funny.
[41:17.92]Show it.
[41:18.60]By the way, you can't find this.
[41:19.82]I've already looked for it.
[41:20.82]I've already searched for this.
[41:22.06]I've typed in, like, Tom Green, Mountain Dew.
[41:24.74]Tom Green sits with old lady on bench.
[41:27.34]It doesn't exist.
[41:28.16]It's gone forever.
[41:37.25]I didn't... No, I did not imagine it.
[41:42.11]It was the Mandela effect.
[41:43.83]No, no, no, this happened.
[41:46.29]And then he keeps going, do you like the way I dance?
[41:50.76]Do you like the way I dance?
[41:52.48]And she's like, get out of here.
[41:54.10]This is water.
[41:57.88]Wait, you got it?
[41:59.70]Wait, how did I not find this?
[42:00.98]When was this uploaded?
[42:06.94]No, this is fucking not even it.
[42:08.08]You're liars.
[42:12.64]This is when he's doing the daddy-would-you-like-some-sausage thing.
[42:16.10]Yeah, no.
[42:17.22]Here, here, here.
[42:18.06]It's not it.
[42:19.34]I've looked.
[42:20.12]Trust me.
[42:22.00]I seriously have looked for this.
[42:22.92]Tom Green, delicious soda.
[42:26.94]Wait, is this the delicious soda?
[42:31.68]No, this is not it.
[42:34.73]This is not it.
[42:35.53]It's an old lady on a bench.
[42:38.71]This is not it.
[42:40.35]Hold on, this is important.
[42:43.14]Is this it?
[42:43.58]This is it.
[42:49.54]Hungry and delicious soda.
[42:50.78]No, it's an old lady sitting on a bench.
[42:56.17]He dreamed it.
[42:58.59]You imagined it.
[42:59.35]No, I didn't.
[43:06.69]It's combined memories?
[43:11.91]No.
[43:15.42]No, it's not.
[43:16.97]No!
[43:17.17]No!
[43:17.25]That's not it!
[43:17.81]Did you find it?
[43:18.99]It's it!
[43:19.83]Somebody got it!
[43:21.25]No, this is not it!
[43:46.63]What?
[43:46.91]What is this it?
[43:47.47]No, it's not?
[43:47.89]No!
[44:21.87]I'm telling you, I looked through this for like six years.
[44:24.03]No, this has nothing to do with Mountain Dew.
[44:28.26]You guys are wrong.
[44:29.22]Is it mixed memories?
[44:29.82]Here's a script.
[44:30.48]Hold on, there's a script for it.
[44:54.50]Here's the script.
[45:00.40]Okay, I have to go.
[45:01.98]It's not this one.
[45:03.65]What kind of pie is it?
[45:05.63]It's a pie one.
[45:06.71]Alright, that's combined memories.
[45:11.39]I'm gonna lose my fucking mind.
[45:14.07]Park bench?
[45:14.43]So you're just relaxing here today, enjoying a cigarette and a glass of Mountain Dew?
[45:19.94]Not water, I'll have you know.
[45:21.76]Do you drink Mountain Dew?
[45:23.82]No.
[45:24.90]Do you drink Mountain Dew?
[45:26.74]No.
[45:27.92]Do you drink Mountain Dew?
[45:30.22]Hey, what are you doing?
[45:32.50]Here, I'm going to do my little dance for you while you drink your water, and then we'll go, okay?
[45:35.79]Oh, my God.
[45:36.59]Oh, my God, right.
[45:38.65]What?
[45:43.77]There's no video.
[45:44.59]What are you, a snake or something?
[45:48.73]For God's sake.
[45:50.37]What are you, a snake?
[45:53.73]That was the line.
[45:54.55]Oh, yeah, the beautiful.
[45:56.55]Go away, I can't.
[45:57.96]See you later.
[45:59.34]You have a good day.
[46:00.08]Now dance your way wherever.
[46:01.48]Oh, what are you, some kind of snake?
[46:07.62]There it is.
[46:10.18]Glass of Mountain Dew.
[46:14.59]Alright, it was, alright, it was, I thought it was, it was funny.
[46:18.34]I thought it was funny.
[46:19.42]I was like fucking 15.
[46:20.72]I don't know.
[46:23.88]It's funny.
[46:25.54]What?
[46:27.18]This is the worst joke of 2020.
[46:30.56]It's, I didn't make this joke.
[46:34.50]I'm reminiscing.
[46:36.69]I didn't like teleport back in time and become Tom Green and do the Mountain Dew joke.
[46:44.19]Alright, what's the team look like?
[46:46.13]Looks good.
[46:51.73]It was mixed memories.
[46:52.99]Alright, do I have... Am I good enough to do the secret one?
[47:02.34]No sound?
[47:02.88]I got you.
[47:11.56]Okay, here we go.
[47:13.68]What are you guys doing?
[47:15.04]Stop bullying!
[47:15.92]Yeah
[47:33.78]Oh, right, there was a video game here.
[47:35.08]Right, I forgot.
[47:35.76]It's been like 25 minutes of talking about fucking aliens and how Tom Green was a funny reference.
[47:44.74]Alright, I gotta play well.
[47:50.54]Wait, positive versus negative.
[47:53.29]Who wins?
[48:00.95]Alright, get in there and punch.
[48:02.37]Actually, no, stay back, stay back, stay back.
[48:06.91]Ah, you got me.
[48:10.55]Punch, punch, twirl.
[48:12.39]Alright, good.
[48:17.27]I might get something good from this.
[48:18.71]I'm excited.
[48:19.16]Whoa, what the, I thought that was my, no, it's not my ally?
[48:35.29]Remember, this hasn't been a game this whole time.
[48:38.23]It's just been a camera pointed at your pants.
[48:40.55]Okay, now that's funny.
[48:47.33]That would be very funny.
[48:48.23]Alright, we got some good trades going on here.
[48:52.12]This guy's going to die.
[48:52.86]There we go.
[49:01.22]Alright, we're doing well.
[49:08.23]Alright, good trades on the negative.
[49:12.18]Now we close it off.
[49:20.16]Irma, your Reddit penis is out.
[49:22.40]Oh, is it?
[49:24.80]Oh, by the way, somebody gave me a bunch of gold on Reddit.
[49:31.12]I have, I have, is that, okay, is 200 gold a lot?
[49:35.24]How much is that?
[49:42.49]It is.
[49:43.05]It's like an insane amount.
[49:45.34]It's 200?
[49:45.66]I don't know.
[49:51.60]Somebody thinks that's really funny that I have like a ton of reddit gold.
[49:58.19]200 is fucking insane.
[50:00.33]Let me be sure I'm saying this right.
[50:01.67]Is there like other currency too?
[50:04.03]I have like three of them.
[50:07.20]Okay, let's see.
[50:09.88]Yeah, I have 200.
[50:12.88]1.9k karma and 200 coins.
[50:18.04]What do I do with this?
[50:28.94]Where do I see that?
[50:30.88]Is there a way I can see how many coins I have?
[50:33.00]Reddit coins. 200.
[50:40.20]Um, guys, 200 coins is worth like 60 cents.
[50:44.14]Ooh, thunder robot.
[50:51.75]You guys were telling me that I had like $5,000 worth.
[50:53.17]Oh, okay.
[50:53.87]What is karma?
[51:05.83]Can you?
[51:06.07]Alright.
[51:07.43]Why is there like a Red Dead Redemption thing on Reddit?
[51:10.43]Does this track like how many banks I've robbed?
[51:13.72]I don't understand.
[51:14.32]What is karma?
[51:16.34]Ooh, Hammer Knight.
[51:21.98]Pretending not to know.
[51:23.26]I actually don't.
[51:23.90]I don't know what that means.
[51:25.78]How high can it go?
[51:26.42]Is there a maximum it can go?
[51:28.84]By the way, I'm glad we actually got those.
[51:35.39]How high can karma go?
[51:41.15]Reddit gold redemption.
[51:42.26]Seems pretty good.
[51:48.64]Reddit gold redemption.
[51:50.08]Thunderwire.
[51:50.86]Ah, it's this guy.
[51:55.46]When are you going to do an AMA?
[51:56.26]If I were to do an AMA, you can just ask any question and I will just probably answer it.
[52:04.46]Reddit AMAs are just Jerma1 guys.
[52:08.36]Like, that's... I don't... There's no point.
[52:15.46]A robot-type Gachiborg who belongs to the Special Attack Machinery Unit.
[52:19.76]His Thunder Wire shows its true power when strung between allies.
[52:23.44]Walk onto an ally to set it up.
[52:25.02]Ah, he's a support.
[52:27.70]But, you did get Hammer Knight.
[52:35.90]He's got a cool outfit on.
[52:39.06]Give him a try.
[52:39.47]Do a reddit polygraph.
[53:04.98]Saying things that I don't have I don't know they are Okay, who do we'll try the thunder robot to They all fit no you're too expensive Maybe you're too expensive and then we'll put a ninja.

[53:38.10]Let's do this other one.
[53:42.28]Pro rocks.
[53:43.20]What?
[53:47.94]Stop playing games in the wrong aspect ratio.
[53:53.91]Uh... What?
[53:57.93]This is a game that was 4 ADP.
[54:02.10]That's being blown up and upscaled to 720.
[54:05.70]Which is being streamed to you at... What are you talking about?
[54:14.04]You want me to put this in 4x3?
[54:15.92]Why would I do that?
[54:23.07]No.
[54:24.03]Because it's being upscaled to 720.
[54:31.40]It'll be funny.
[54:36.38]It's too stretched.
[54:37.18]No, it's not.
[54:38.44]It isn't.
[54:38.74]Trust me.
[54:43.95]This is how... Okay.
[54:45.99]Remember, this is the Wii.
[54:47.75]So it's going through the Wii.
[54:49.85]And the Wii is taking it.
[54:51.18]This is just playing a GameCube game on the Wii.
[54:53.00]This is what it looks like.
[55:04.99]Actually, this dude's pretty good.
[55:08.07]I like the ball.
[55:16.07]This guy's good.
[55:16.83]I think I found a character I like.
[55:21.91]That good straight line.
[55:22.97]Plus, he kind of looks like a Ninja Turtle.
[55:34.47]I like him.
[55:38.94]That does a lot of damage.
[55:49.78]He's good.
[55:52.28]Look at how good he is.
[55:59.02]Alright, he does not have a combo.
[56:01.62]That's good to know.
[56:05.78]He's got a shield, too.
[56:06.52]Look at this dude.
[56:11.20]Sorry.
[56:11.40]He did a lot.
[56:12.48]Alright.
[56:14.36]Thunder.
[56:14.68]Alright.
[56:18.45]So let's do Lightning Zap.
[56:25.47]So now we're connected.
[56:26.71]Where are we?
[56:32.87]This has to go through an ally.
[56:33.87]Okay.
[56:36.98]He's just spraying everywhere.
[56:38.20]How do I target an ally?
[56:53.73]Z is lock on?
[56:54.83]Yeah, but I can't.
[56:55.97]Isn't this the one that goes to an ally?
[57:00.47]Hold Z. Hold Z.
[57:04.44]Uh, hold Z. Z. Is my ally dead?
[57:08.83]Oh, he's dead.
[57:19.63]It's alright.
[57:23.88]Let's just fucking end this.
[57:39.35]Oh, shit.
[57:43.65]Nice.
[57:44.79]That's what we call performance.
[57:58.07]Performance anxiety.
[57:59.77]No, that's called performance.
[58:01.75]Although I gotta be careful because I don't want to lose.
[58:07.65]Oh boy, I'm gonna lose.
[58:09.56]What do I have left?
[58:10.48]Oh, that's not good.
[58:12.86]It is actually time to get serious.
[58:14.00]Ah!
[58:19.16]Shh, it's fine.
[58:27.97]Oh, you motherfucker.

[59:30.41]Alright, here we go.
[59:42.46]Let's try this again.

[65:55.05]That hurts.
[66:00.60]Alright, I'll meet you in the middle.
[66:02.60]I'm going to meet you guys in the middle.
[66:04.68]We're not going to do 4-3.
[66:05.26]We're not going to do 16x9.
[66:06.82]We're going to do 5x7.
[66:08.77]We're going to do a standard piece of computer paper.
[66:29.21]Not stretching it yet.
[66:30.19]Hold on.
[66:30.53]It hasn't been stretched.
[66:38.36]Okay.
[66:39.60]Alright.
[66:40.00]Alright.
[66:40.32]See?
[66:42.02]There we go.
[66:47.72]Look at that.
[66:49.02]We can all agree with this.
[66:50.18]We can all agree.
[66:54.01]Not too far.
[66:55.11]Big.
[66:55.43]Not too far.
[66:56.39]Small.
[66:57.17]And it fits.
[66:58.23]It looks good.
[67:01.56]I knew somebody was going to call me a centrist.
[67:03.40]That's fine.
[67:04.00]It's off center.
[67:09.88]Don't worry, I got it.
[67:20.43]Ooh, a wind Valkyrie.
[67:27.71]There we go.
[67:28.29]Okay, now everyone can be happy.
[67:30.48]I got it.
[67:30.90]It's not off-center anymore.
[67:34.44]Hold on, maybe a little bit.
[67:38.88]There.
[67:39.74]Now we can all be happy.
[67:44.13]See?
[67:44.67]Now it's, like, not quite 4-3, but it's not 16 by 9, and it's not... You guys just... That's all I need to say is...
[68:00.02]The same as before.
[68:00.96]No, it's not.
[68:02.59]Before, it was the whole screen.
[68:09.07]Compromise makes no one happy.
[68:12.11]What's that old saying?
[68:14.52]As long as both sides are unhappy, that means you came to an agreement.
[68:20.48]Who said that?
[68:21.66]Who said that?
[68:24.47]What's that?
[68:24.79]There's a famous quote from a guy from Pasta Italiano.
[68:28.05]No.
[68:29.35]No, no, no, no.
[68:29.75]There's like a, oh, there's, you can tell if both parties are unhappy, then that means something worked out.
[68:35.56]What is it?
[68:36.40]Winston Churchill said it or something?
[68:40.38]You can tell if you did a good job negotiating when both parties are unhappy.
[68:43.96]What did he say?
[68:49.25]That was not, that was not, that was not Adolf Hitler.
[68:54.34]It was not Adolf Hitler.
[68:58.78]I know it was not.
[68:59.86]I was like fucking Winston Churchill or something.
[69:16.14]No, what?
[69:23.53]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[69:25.03]What is it?
[69:26.16]A good compromise is when both parties are dissatisfied.
[69:28.74]It was Larry David.
[69:30.14]That was Larry David.
[69:32.54]Good.
[69:33.52]Perfect.
[69:34.10]Yes.
[69:34.42]He's quoting Hitler.
[69:37.92]No, I'm quoting Larry David.
[69:53.57]It was Larry David.
[69:56.33]Okay.
[69:58.79]No.
[69:59.07]Alright, that's it.
[70:04.05]Oh, I love Larry David.
[70:05.83]He's funny.
[70:07.60]And it was exactly, yeah, it was Larry David.
[70:09.94]That's a centrist ideology.
[70:18.88]Everyone should suffer.
[70:28.96]it's a computer aspect ratio holy man I can't believe I can't believe this streamer here is it's just I mean that's actually hitler said this
[70:52.51]wanted it for three.
[70:53.67]I wanted to see if I died.

[71:00.24]Alright, let's go.
[71:08.23]Right.
[71:21.41]Tunnel vision?
[71:22.35]No.
[71:26.28]Jerma's in the back pocket of big plasma trying to push his widescreen narrative.
[71:38.55]Big plasma.
[71:44.49]Oh, but it's classic.
[71:47.75]How come you don't use it for every aspect ratio then?
[71:50.76]Put your fucking... Put your monitor right now in 4x3.
[71:52.60]640x480.
[71:52.84]Do it.
[71:53.70]Wow, you're so good.
[71:58.00]You like it so much.
[72:00.18]Go boot up.
[72:01.40]Go boot up.
[72:02.66]Go boot up TF2.
[72:04.38]And put it in fucking 360p.
[72:06.28]Let's see how long you... Until you crack like a fucking egg.
[72:10.85]Wow.
[72:25.96]I always have it in 360.
[72:30.24]No, no, no, no, no.
[72:32.08]By the way, I'm not talking about the people that have the Dell computer all the way at the left on the shelf at Best Buy.
[72:38.50]I know.
[72:38.84]I've been one of those people before.
[72:47.81]That's doing pretty well.
[72:56.31]It's a generic computer.
[72:58.95]Yeah, you can always tell which one it is.
[73:01.09]It's all the way to the left, and it has no specs.
[73:04.08]It just says, very fast processor.
[73:06.00]Intel.
[73:06.24]It's Intel processor.
[73:08.32]It's just not even a quad core.
[73:16.72]Perfect for emails.
[73:20.60]There's no graphics card in there.
[73:21.78]It's integrated.
[73:35.87]What do you mean?
[73:36.43]What do you mean Intel in 2020?
[73:40.65]But you don't Intel.
[73:43.09]I'm sorry.
[73:43.49]I like the company that has the the clean boost technology.
[73:48.36]Makes you whites wider and your brights brighter.
[73:50.26]They got me.
[73:54.98]I'm on my way.

[74:31.32]Take that plastic off those swords and get ready to use them.
[74:45.85]Who's our next?
[74:46.47]Okay.
[74:46.99]What is it?
[74:48.83]Oh, finally, we got our upgraded ninja.
[75:01.52]I'm not sure.
[75:02.42]I don't know what's going to be in here.
[75:04.04]It's uncertain.
[75:05.12]It's another... We can make an entire ninja party.
[75:14.83]Yep.
[75:16.41]Alright, this is ridiculous.
[75:24.05]This is disgusting to me.
[75:25.63]This is disgusting me.

[75:53.25]Nympho.
[75:54.45]Kage.
[75:55.31]Bunshin.
[76:04.36]I'm fucking human.
[76:05.74]I'm a human.
[76:06.28]You don't sit there and play a game and no one's listening to you when you do it.
[76:10.84]You just sit there and you go, oops.
[76:13.77]Don't worry.
[76:14.17]There's not like 5 trillion people that laugh at you
[76:19.35]I'm just a fucking human, alright?
[76:21.69]We produce all kinds of organisms inside of us.
[76:25.05]Did you know that at any moment right now, at any given second, there are 500 trillion living organisms in your body, inside of your rectum, and your intestinal tract, and some in your stomach, you have acid.
[76:39.64]We're fucked.

[78:59.23]This is a very cute dog, though.
[79:03.25]iPad Otto.
[79:08.76]Show the real Otto.

[79:22.80]It is insanity.
[79:27.27]Shuriken.
[79:28.21]Shinobi Physical Attack and then Shuriken Cutter.
[79:30.91]The deadliest Gachaborg in the assassination unit.
[79:34.63]The big shuriken on his back is made of extremely heavy durable metal so it can slash through anything.
[79:46.53]Well, let's make our team.

[80:00.62]Wind Valkyrie.
[80:01.28]Didn't we just get Wind Valkyrie?
[80:04.46]Probably one of the fastest characters in the game.
[80:09.50]Butterfly Fan, Magic Shot, Big Fan, and Fly.
[80:13.56]This Angel Borg enjoys flying and even sleeps while floating in the air.
[80:17.29]The winds blowing through the Mega Borg planet are created by the Wind Valkyrie.
[80:23.05]Big Fan.
[80:24.13]Oh, we'll give her a try.
[80:26.83]Alright.
[80:29.05]Let's get this squared away here.

[80:38.80]I want you in here.
[80:44.84]Aww.
[80:44.94]Alright.
[80:50.09]We're gonna have flying figurines over here.
[80:56.45]What's this one?
[80:57.87]What's this one, two, three?
[80:59.19]I don't get it.
[80:59.61]Why are these here?
[81:12.47]We're going to have robots.
[81:13.15]We're going to have knights.
[81:17.69]Okay, robots.
[81:19.23]Down here.
[81:22.53]Knights will be here.
[81:26.25]Oh, this is a ninja.
[81:27.57]But I don't want you on my team.
[81:30.37]Alright.
[81:32.49]This is a Kung Fu Master.
[81:34.21]Kind of like a boxer.
[81:37.37]Oh, you go up here.
[81:41.43]Press Y to sort.
[81:46.67]Forgless.
[81:49.11]No.

[81:53.07]Change force name.
[81:55.11]Delete a force.
[81:56.07]Forgless.
[81:57.40]Press Y to sword.
[81:58.52]No, you can't sort like that.
[82:06.44]We need a new force name.
[82:07.36]We don't know what we want permanently.
[82:08.90]That kid has to wait.
[82:12.79]We'll do flying over here.
[82:19.57]Who else can fly?
[82:21.81]Fly.
[82:22.11]Okay.
[82:25.81]Then we're going to have knights and melee characters.
[82:31.12]Underneath.
[82:40.34]Okay.
[82:40.68]Melee character.
[82:44.85]And then we're going to do it by cost.
[82:50.89]This is technically not a melee character.
[82:52.59]It's just a robot.
[82:54.83]Okay, claw bot.
[82:56.83]Okay, here we go.
[82:57.53]We're going to have shooter characters after this.
[83:05.39]Claw robot, thunder robot.

[84:23.56]You go like... Okay.
[84:29.22]It's clean now.
[84:29.92]I can actually take a look and see.
[84:32.12]This is the ninja category.

[86:27.72]Two regular knights!
[86:38.85]Holy shit, that's a big team.
[86:40.03]Okay, we're good.
[86:44.66]He's not forcing us to like it.
[86:47.48]I'm not forcing anybody to like anything.
[86:52.40]This is a completionist's dream.
[86:55.76]Yes.
[86:57.36]I believe the game never ends, either.
[86:59.62]Somebody said that it goes to infinite New Game Plus.
[87:04.66]But please, give it a 3 out of 10.
[87:07.52]I can't believe that.
[87:08.96]Mystic Ray game.
[87:09.72]Alright, let's check this dude out.
[87:11.74]He's got 30.
[87:13.54]30.
[87:16.75]That's a lot of ammo slots.
[87:18.75]Alright, kind of cool.
[87:23.55]Alright, his huge cosplay foam is getting in the way.
[87:35.96]I feel like this dude would have trouble crossing the Blizzard stage.
[87:40.26]Whoa!
[87:46.01]Yeah, this guy's actually really good.
[87:47.13]Let me try to get that.
[87:54.67]Did you just see how much damage that did?
[87:57.52]This dude's fucking insane.
[88:06.62]He's got a really good movement, too.
[88:13.02]Kind of hard to catch up to a plane.
[88:23.26]Whoa, I just like Flying Squirrel.
[88:32.47]God damn it.
[88:32.91]Alright, just hit the... Ally, do something.
[88:40.23]Oh, I just got bombed.
[88:44.91]That shreds.
[88:46.51]It shreds people.
[88:47.53]He's dead, but it shreds people.
[88:48.65]Alright, what about this dude?
[88:56.45]Okay, I think I have to charge it and I turn into two?
[89:02.94]Whoa.
[89:04.00]Two bombs?
[89:06.18]This is awesome.
[89:06.78]How long does it last?
[89:13.52]Alright, Elastic.
[89:14.80]Let's do it again.
[89:15.26]You have to stand still, though.
[89:18.82]That's not good.
[89:27.61]Bam!
[89:28.45]Come on, double!
[89:30.41]Woo!
[89:36.04]Oh, it was so fun to sit there and hit that button over and over again.
[89:38.36]I'm sorry.
[89:44.21]He's slow as shit.
[89:44.93]I'll get him.
[89:46.79]Double melee attack?
[89:47.73]Let's go.
[89:50.45]No, let's not do that, actually.
[89:51.67]Let's not do that.
[89:52.31]Run away.
[90:05.69]I don't think I can replace these guys.
[90:06.97]Oh, yeah.
[90:11.38]When you get at least 40% of them to hit.
[90:15.75]One issue where these guys are going to be bad is when this thing's moving around very fast and you cannot charge that up and stand still.
[90:22.57]He's got a lot of health.
[90:34.22]It's alright.
[90:44.77]Look at that bar.
[90:45.31]He's going to be a huge chunk of that bar.
[90:47.89]His health is probably like 500.
[90:48.77]Yeah, look at that.
[90:50.87]One more guy.
[90:51.31]This is not a tank.
[90:52.73]Alright, let's see if we can dance around you and slash you up a little bit.
[91:11.22]How did you predict my movement?
[91:23.83]There we go.
[91:24.27]I just double tapped him.
[91:27.36]These dudes have so much health.
[91:33.72]Oh, now I got him in the corner.
[91:34.82]You're fucking screwed.
[91:35.89]Dermot's resolve has been tested.
[91:46.26]He's paranoid.
[91:51.79]Alright, we have this is the next this is the story mission make sure we're going in with what we want I Didn't even use this character.
[92:05.52]I like a both Alright.
[92:08.00]This is an important mission.
[92:08.90]So I'm gonna have to use the things I like I
[92:15.69]I think that too many ninjas in a row.
[92:17.51]Spread them out a little bit.
[92:20.41]We have 410 points.
[92:29.78]Hmm.
[92:32.72]That's kind of... Use the teleport ninja.
[92:38.70]Yeah, I guess... I wouldn't... Teleport kind of doesn't make any sense to me.
[92:45.29]You could use Spike Head.
[92:47.49]Nah, he's 470.
[92:48.87]I could take out... I'll try it.
[92:51.71]I'll try it.
[92:52.55]But I want to break it up a little bit.
[92:53.73]You know, it can't just be quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[92:57.66]These guys are all just quick and weak.
[93:00.34]I'll try it.
[93:07.96]Teleport is awesome.
[93:11.29]Yeah, I'm just trying to cooperate with Usagi to beat the ICBM tanks.
[93:19.73]Looks like a pretty good team.
[93:39.08]Beat enemy gachaborgs, yes.
[93:47.57]Oh, it's hitting the lip.
[93:50.05]Oh.
[93:55.64]Oh.
[93:56.70]Oh, you got to get over there, man.
[94:04.62]How do I avoid that?
[94:11.82]Quick, quick, quick.
[94:12.44]Get it, get it, get it, get it.
[94:13.06]Don't let him do it.
[94:13.56]Do I have to jump?
[94:15.97]Where do I go?
[94:17.36]Teleport out of it.
[94:18.82]Teleport.
[94:27.17]Can I get one of these tanks?
[94:28.25]I think I'm going to die.
[94:30.91]Do I just have to jump?
[94:35.95]Oh, shit.
[94:37.11]One didn't hit me.
[94:40.47]Die.
[94:41.67]Die before it kills us.
[94:47.59]Holy shit, I got him.
[94:52.21]You definitely can get that nuke, by the way.
[94:54.30]No way you can't.
[95:03.04]Awww.
[95:06.94]Alright.
[95:09.27]Let's give it up.
[95:11.59]Crash Course Part 2.
[95:14.66]You can get everything, even the dragons.
[95:20.08]That's so cool.
[95:20.86]Uh-oh.
[95:30.12]Alright, who do we go for first?
[95:35.95]Uh, over here.
[95:41.43]Yep.
[95:42.39]Ooh.
[95:45.46]That was a double.
[95:47.22]Stay in, stay in, stay in, stay in.
[95:53.65]Oh my god, this dude is as good as Spikehead.
[96:01.84]What was his name?
[96:02.98]Bookerberry or something?
[96:06.58]Bookerberry is just Bugleberry.
[96:08.84]But, okay, you know how Snoopy has Spike?
[96:12.06]And Spike's like kind of a little, like more rough.
[96:16.24]Booger... Boogerberry is Bugleberry's spike.
[96:20.16]Those bogus... What?
[96:21.02]Don't die.
[96:31.41]I gotta trade here.
[96:32.27]There we go.
[96:38.24]It's a Bugleberry anti-hero.
[96:43.27]What do you have that for?
[96:45.45]Is it a shield?
[96:50.03]Aww, that's alright.
[96:56.98]Out of here.
[97:01.10]Stay in front so I can use the shield.
[97:08.61]One more hit.
[97:10.23]Ooh, one more hit.
[97:12.13]Ah.
[97:19.93]Turn off the music and please sing for us instead.
[97:21.77]I don't think you're going to want that.
[97:24.39]Ooh, it's alright.
[97:37.06]We got a... Okay, teleport ninja.
[97:42.04]How much damage does this do?
[97:52.00]Okay, starting to understand.
[97:54.06]Oh, I'm starting to understand why this character is good.
[97:57.56]Understood.
[98:03.59]Alright, nuke.
[98:05.33]Give us a nuke.
[98:18.20]Do I take donations?
[98:22.38]You can give bits.
[98:23.82]I don't have a PayPal or anything, though.
[98:26.84]Command Girl.
[98:38.91]Wait.
[98:39.85]I gotta check my crystals.
[98:41.99]Command Girl is the best.
[98:44.43]Command Girl is so good.
[98:49.55]Really?
[98:58.48]Uh... Just zero attack.
[99:03.24]Defense, shooting, and attack.
[99:05.12]Speed?
[99:09.36]Beam and Buster Laser.
[99:12.36]An assassin from the planet Megaborg who is equipped with a beam gun.
[99:17.01]She relies on her weapons but avoids... Oh, she just can't know melee at all?
[99:25.25]Alright.
[99:25.61]What are you doing over here?
[99:30.25]You're supposed to be over in the flyers.
[99:31.51]And you're supposed to be down here at the shooters.
[99:42.32]No, get rid of you.
[99:43.69]No, you're good.
[99:46.65]You're good too.
[99:47.35]You're also good.
[99:48.49]We'll try.
[99:50.01]Yeah, I'll take you off now.
[99:52.79]See how command girl is.
[99:54.77]Still doing the singing thing?
[99:55.93]No.
[99:56.91]It's crypto.
[100:05.55]Yes, I had an Ethereum address.
[100:10.01]that I had there, and it was... Hey, look, check it out.
[100:14.56]You can send Ether, Ethereum, crypto.
[100:19.52]And it was there for about six and a half, seven months.
[100:24.28]That took in about, I believe, six or seven dollars worth of Ethereum over six or seven months.
[100:31.84]So, which, that's fine.
[100:36.30]It's not like, oh, nobody gave me enough money, so I'm deleting it.
[100:40.06]It just wasn't really used and it was just like, eh, people don't really care anymore.
[100:48.03]You are CNN ass streamer.
[100:50.23]Fucking nerd.
[100:54.13]What does that mean?
[100:54.87]I... I'm trying... Why do I like... I'm piecing together what you're talking about.
[101:04.00]That's exactly what I just made fun of.
[101:07.92]What did I make fun of?
[101:12.55]What did I do?
[101:13.01]Alright, this is going to be a hard fight.
[101:15.32]Okay.
[101:32.01]I probably shouldn't have started with, uh... With vacuum cleaner, girl.
[101:38.53]Whatever that is.
[101:39.23]With big boxing glove vacuum.
[101:50.88]Well, we gotta fight five people at the same time.
[101:53.10]Oh, she definitely doesn't suck.
[101:56.74]I just can't, you know, I'm fighting a full team.
[102:09.23]I'm hitting somebody.
[102:15.88]These motherfuckers can't even take me down.
[102:20.60]I'm doing some good damage.
[102:21.96]Get out.
[102:26.18]Sorry, I did a lot of damage.
[102:27.78]Alright, clean it up.
[102:43.31]Good.
[102:43.55]Focus, focus, focus on him.
[102:46.22]Don't let him get away.
[102:47.90]This is your time to shine.
[102:49.99]He just transformed, but he's dead.
[102:55.83]He just kicked his own guy.
[103:05.27]Yeah, your teamwork is not... Alright, let's go.
[103:44.30]Come on, one health!
[103:46.16]Alright, that was a bad team for this.
[103:50.16]Show us your J.O.
[103:55.70]Crystal.
[103:56.10]I don't know who that is.
[104:03.99]CNN player.
[104:11.62]Okay, we're going to change this.
[104:13.32]We need beef.
[104:19.80]Okay.
[104:23.18]You're good, but not now.
[104:26.32]We need beef.
[104:32.42]Bubble Knight did pretty good.
[104:34.52]You did alright too.
[104:35.34]You can stay.
[104:35.86]230.
[104:36.94]Who can I put in?
[104:40.61]No, I need beef.
[104:47.69]I'm going to regret this, but here's your one shot.
[105:06.83]Look at the crystals.
[105:16.76]Confirm.
[105:17.38]Alright.
[105:17.54]N121C.
[105:18.98]Damn.
[105:19.24]I need one more.
[105:20.24]Oh.
[105:23.36]N121B, N121C.
[105:25.06]I need N121A and I get this thing.
[105:27.98]Damn it.
[105:28.40]Oh well.
[105:48.92]Go and get it.
[105:49.46]It's easier said than done.
[105:51.70]Alright, we're giving Hatchet Knight a chance here.
[105:54.18]If I take you off, can I add... Okay, 590.
[106:02.65]I didn't realize just how expensive Hammer Knight actually was.
[106:05.69]That's insanely expensive.
[106:07.25]Um... I can put you back in.
[106:11.27]I got 280.
[106:13.01]Hmm.
[106:22.90]330, 480.
[106:25.50]Double ninja, yeah.
[106:27.64]Alright, we'll try this.
[106:30.52]You're ignoring chat.
[106:32.58]Somebody said they lost their J.O.
[106:34.10]Crystal.
[106:34.56]Feels bad, man.
[106:36.69]Lods support J.O.
[106:37.79]Crystals.
[106:38.33]Feels bad, man.
[106:40.11]J.O.
[106:40.71]Crystal.
[106:42.15]Why am I ignoring chat?
[106:44.39]Stop saying that.
[106:50.91]I'm tell- what first I'm ignoring everybody and now I'm addressing what everyone's saying and now I'm don't stop addressing us?
[107:00.83]Run away.
[107:01.47]Oh.
[107:01.53]Okay.
[107:22.71]That's what that is.
[107:23.93]Sure.
[107:24.85]Alright, let's continue.
[107:27.28]This, by the way, like I said, this is Hatchet Knight's one shot.
[107:37.01]If you're a Hatchet Knight supporter, I'm going to have to see you in the chat because this is the only shot he's going to get.
[108:05.35]Alright, he's benched.
[108:21.14]Maybe one day he'll get a shot.
[108:31.32]Gotta focus on one person at a time.
[108:32.60]You.
[108:35.35]You're dead.
[108:36.70]I just got like everybody.
[108:39.66]Look, I got a lot of damage in there.
[108:40.82]Alright, here we go.
[108:41.48]Here comes the equalizer.
[108:50.00]He instantly died.
[109:12.38]Are we about to see somebody always have a spot on my team?
[109:42.15]Oh, there's always a spot for you.
[109:45.07]There's always a spot for you now.
[109:46.63]Don't get cocky.
[109:54.86]Double ninja.
[109:57.00]Always gets a spot.
[109:58.06]No matter what.
[110:09.52]Big bits.
[110:11.12]Phylactery.
[110:12.38]Even more.
[110:13.16]Huge money drops.
[110:17.44]Ooh.
[110:17.92]It's like a punch guy.
[110:18.74]$50.
[110:23.12]Another $50.
[110:25.68]Jerma, a J-O crystal is like a little talisman you use with your bros.
[110:31.54]You guys all hang out and just kind of do this.
[110:36.14]Don't tell anyone.
[110:36.78]It's just for us bros.
[110:37.90]Okay.
[110:43.33]This is 50 bucks.
[110:47.51]Don't tell anyone.
[110:48.99]It's just for, okay.
[110:50.31]Well, I just told 5,000 people.
[110:52.17]Sorry.
[110:55.63]Alright, we have to have a bench category.
[110:59.25]Yeah, it's over here.
[111:01.41]This is the bench.
[111:03.58]For 500, maybe you'll come out one day in Disney movie somebody.
[111:08.64]And it'll be like, wow, he came off the bench and he sunk like five threes.
[111:13.58]Now's not your time.
[111:19.39]And we won the championship because of that.
[111:23.85]Okay.
[111:24.73]I have not... What?
[111:26.61]570 remaining.
[111:28.69]Kind of let me down, but I'll keep you there for now.
[111:31.47]Uh, where's... Put you back in here at number one.
[111:35.80]I like this guy.
[111:44.03]Oh, Command.
[111:44.67]Right, Command.
[111:45.21]Command Girl.
[111:52.01]Yeah, I could get rid of you.
[111:53.61]Put you back down with the robots.
[111:58.44]I still have 260.
[112:01.36]Normal Knight?
[112:01.92]I feel like I haven't given these big, bulky robots much of a chance, but I'm not going to.
[112:16.56]260.
[112:24.08]She was kind of good.
[112:25.67]She was alright.
[112:27.75]You need an ally, though.
[112:29.65]Or maybe a flyer, yeah.
[112:30.73]Okay, we're going to try Wind.
[112:34.62]Yeah, we didn't do Wind Valkyrie yet.
[112:51.35]Make multiple teams?
[112:53.51]I will when I have 500 robots.
[112:54.99]Did I tweet this?
[113:01.51]Yeah.
[113:12.36]Don't forget to press fucking X. Yeah, well, I was going against five people at the same time.
[113:21.47]Oh, it's a... Okay.
[113:24.47]You can just stay way back.
[113:32.56]I now see the appeal.
[113:33.72]I can't even get over here.
[113:59.92]I don't know why I just got cocky and went in close.
[114:04.06]You're a camper.
[114:04.72]Yeah, that's the character.
[114:07.56]The character is a camper.
[114:08.44]Aww.
[114:16.15]Alright, let's check out this.
[114:19.01]Is this the wind?
[114:30.44]What the hell does that do?
[114:35.11]What does that do?
[114:42.43]Does it do damage?
[114:51.40]It's just knockback bench.
[114:52.62]Gonna be a nice warm spot underneath you.
[115:01.28]Because you ain't ever going to get up from that bench.
[115:12.27]You're going to be sitting on that bench for so long, there's going to be an imprint of your ass on the metal.
[115:18.22]Maybe I'll try this time.
[115:36.68]Command Girl is good.
[115:38.50]I'll keep Command Girl.
[115:40.64]And of course, Bubble Bot is just always just key.
[115:45.45]Very solid player.
[115:57.15]I'm sure there's probably somebody out there that has played this game before and is like, dude, he doesn't even understand that those, the flying Valkyries, they are so, you're just playing wrong.
[116:06.59]They're the best characters in the game.
[116:07.89]You can just cheese every level.
[116:09.29]I'm sure they exist.
[116:10.17]I'm sure you can do that.
[116:12.15]But my buddy Bubblebot is going to have to take that.
[116:16.33]That's my playing strategy.
[116:17.31]That's my playing style.
[116:18.13]87%, 88% dodge ratio.
[116:18.97]Are you kidding me?
[116:27.32]Bubble butt.
[116:28.98]Bubble butt.
[116:32.98]Yeah, my buddy Bubble Butt over here.
[116:34.60]Ooh.
[116:38.47]Okay, we've got two.
[116:41.23]Now here we have some benching to do.
[116:47.65]Okay, that frees up some space.
[116:50.96]We'll start with you.
[117:03.80]Okay, 270.
[117:04.40]I think I want to get you back in here, though.
[117:11.84]He's like the best character I have.
[117:19.69]Who's worth putting in for normal knight?
[117:34.34]Put me in slot 24.
[117:39.74]I mean, Guard Witch could just be... I mean, it's just another character.
[117:45.04]Alright, when we get to Guard Witch, we know it's time to really try as hard as we can.
[117:50.17]Guard Witch is just going to die.
[118:02.21]Revolver Gunman?
[118:04.97]Maybe.
[118:05.63]Maybe one day.
[118:07.03]I love Revolver Gunman, but you gotta change it up.
[118:14.71]Another GF Commander.
[118:15.83]Hey, GF Commander, if they got you for us, you're about to be destroyed.
[118:20.29]Uh, the guy with Woody?
[118:27.10]No.
[118:27.82]I want Woody, though.
[118:30.70]Dude, you have Woody and Jaxx.
[118:34.72]I want those.
[118:35.22]What the fuck?
[118:45.15]Uh, Tsutomu has an airplane now.
[118:46.99]Uh oh, they have a bigger airplane.
[119:00.54]It's clear how this is going to end.
[119:05.01]I'm starting to realize why this show didn't take off.
[119:11.81]That's him.
[119:27.18]Alright, this is one of my best characters.
[119:28.54]Get in there.
[119:36.28]Got it.
[119:41.88]Keep up the pressure, keep up the pressure, keep up the pressure, pressure, pressure, pressure.
[119:44.32]Fuck.
[119:54.80]Come on, get it!
[119:57.00]No!
[119:57.86]Okay, good.
[120:01.77]I got to get some shots in before he gets another part.
[120:04.03]Alright.
[120:05.55]That's something.
[120:06.33]That's a character I haven't seen yet.
[120:14.86]Whoa.
[120:18.56]I caught him in a full almost an entire revolution.
[120:21.06]This will hit.
[120:30.38]He thinks this will hit.
[120:32.84]What a fucking idiot.
[120:35.50]Alright, let's go.
[120:39.32]Bubble bot.
[120:41.44]Stay away from the giant ship right now, because it's on fire.
[120:46.84]Where's your supporting fire?
[121:01.85]Alright, keep him in here.
[121:03.43]He can't get close to Bubblebot, no way.
[121:04.69]What did he just throw at me?
[121:20.94]Come on, he's just out of reach!
[121:23.10]No!
[121:24.38]Come here, girl!
[121:29.32]Wow.
[121:38.12]Check this shit out.
[121:38.66]This is gonna be crazy.
[121:48.70]Take out the big fucking ship.
[121:53.45]Thanatos?
[121:54.39]Uh-oh.
[121:56.99]Who's left?
[121:57.45]Uh-oh.
[121:58.87]Time to try hard.
[121:59.91]I have to try really hard.
[122:03.35]With Strawberry Shortcake.
[122:04.87]That means try.
[122:16.02]Strawberry Shortcake, actually pretty good.
[122:17.65]No, we just have the big boat thing.
[122:33.32]Okay.
[122:34.58]Okay, here we go.
[122:36.50]We should get this, right?
[122:40.83]Stay in the air.
[122:43.81]Come on.
[122:46.66]Come on!
[122:47.46]Do it!
[122:49.05]Do it!
[122:50.09]Do it!
[122:50.93]Do it!
[122:52.39]Oh!
[122:52.71]I thought that was me.
[122:55.01]Am I bad at this game?
[122:56.19]I'm not.
[122:56.55]I just won.
[122:57.03]Alright.
[122:59.67]Well, it's obvious.
[123:01.19]I got a 62% hit ratio and 97% dodge ratio.
[123:07.43]That's not... What do you want me to say?
[123:11.79]Darn.
[123:12.89]You guys must have cheated.
[123:21.48]You got lucky.
[123:25.90]I don't know.
[123:26.44]That guy doesn't seem too serious.
[123:31.53]We didn't even get anything for that.
[123:32.53]Bullshit.
[123:36.09]Okay.
[123:36.57]I like this team.
[123:37.19]I like this team.
[123:43.84]We need... Hmm...
[123:55.38]It's an odd number.
[124:05.27]I remember this Valkyrie was pretty good.
[124:10.39]In fact, we're going to put you in the front here.
[124:14.04]That makes more sense to me.
[124:15.72]Okay, that's better.
[124:19.88]1580 exact.
[124:25.24]How did I cheat?
[124:25.96]Did I use my superpower?
[124:32.43]Bury Bubblebutt, or Rumble.
[124:34.27]I don't know if that's gonna work out.
[124:36.61]Alright, here we go.
[124:39.21]Battle with Sho and Yuji.
[124:46.23]I'll destroy them all.
[124:46.95]I don't care if they're the Death Force or Gachi Force.
[124:50.67]Oh, fucking centrist.
[124:52.45]I agree with that.
[125:06.72]Alright, do I use Reddit Shelf?
[125:09.90]Team Ninja.
[125:12.60]Heals.
[125:15.03]Really cool swords.
[125:19.41]What do you inject?
[125:26.62]I'm going to use Reddit Shelf.
[125:33.06]What is that?
[125:36.60]What is that thing?
[125:42.91]Shit, I have a major, major character.
[125:45.45]I could say something right now that looks like that is exactly what that is.
[125:49.47]But I can't, because I... No, I couldn't do that.
[125:52.44]But that's just... But there's an exact reference to who that is, and I can't say it.
[125:58.96]I don't even want to say what it potentially could be referencing.
[126:01.54]You got lucky!
[126:12.55]Is it slow motion field?
[126:13.63]Yeah, it is.
[126:18.34]It's a slow motion field.
[126:22.92]Oh, that's actually cool.
[126:25.75]Is everything slow in here?
[126:26.67]Even projectiles?
[126:36.94]I'm so focused on this dude.
[126:37.88]I'm not even attacking the other guy.
[126:44.39]Weirdo.
[126:55.79]Yeah.
[127:00.83]He's so fast in that little bubble.
[127:02.21]I got him.
[127:09.76]We need that power because I want to be able to spam this.
[127:15.58]Do it!
[127:29.27]You weren't trying before?
[127:31.01]Liar.
[127:33.68]Oh shit!
[127:34.12]Okay, I can fly.
[127:36.54]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[127:38.36]Up, up, up.
[127:39.08]Get away.
[127:39.70]Get away, get away, get away.
[127:40.62]We can both fly.
[127:41.32]Oh, fuck.
[127:41.68]We can both fly.
[127:43.98]Oh, yeah.
[127:44.18]I forgot this character's awesome.
[127:51.90]But I can't.
[127:53.00]Come on.
[127:53.90]Come on.
[128:05.57]God damn it.
[128:06.29]This guy's fucking insanely powerful.
[128:10.92]He can just float in the fucking air and rain hell.
[128:13.16]How do I get one of these things?
[128:26.29]Oh, this is bad.
[128:36.70]This is where you shine here.
[128:42.08]Counter, counter, counter.
[128:45.69]Get the fuck up.
[128:54.27]Ooh, okay, good.
[128:55.09]Come on.
[129:02.68]Holy shit.
[129:03.88]Holy shit.
[129:19.14]Don't get cocky, fly away!
[129:23.49]Oh my god, is this the last thing I have?
[129:25.21]What's after this?
[129:25.79]I'm at the end of the world!
[129:41.96]I'm gonna choke.
[129:54.23]I have to get something for that, right?
[129:55.33]Huh?

[130:44.14]Cultural anthropology.
[130:51.93]I'm going to keep this team.
[130:52.77]I think it's working out.
[130:57.82]Yeah.
[130:59.06]Why change it?
[131:02.60]I'm something of a cultural anthropologist myself.
[131:07.70]We just keep following these.
[131:08.72]Wait, I got to save again.
[131:11.51]That was funny.
[131:15.95]That was funny.
[131:18.53]One of you guys is real funny.
[131:19.61]I read it.
[131:22.95]It's the same two people.
[131:33.55]It's like following these guys around and bullying them.
[131:44.70]You're coming to get beaten by me too.
[131:47.34]Sure.
[131:48.74]I want... That's a new character.
[131:52.79]Alright.
[131:53.71]Don't let me down.
[131:55.47]Don't let me down.
[131:57.03]Mienna.
[132:00.76]Yeah, see?
[132:02.30]Fuck.
[132:05.10]Okay.
[132:06.72]I need to tell you guys what this is.
[132:09.48]Somebody knows.
[132:11.20]Okay.
[132:12.61]Okay.
[132:13.98]At the end of the stream, I'm going to go into Discord and write it somewhere.
[132:18.10]This is good.
[132:34.13]He's not even... Am I going to perfect you?
[132:36.53]Holy shit.
[132:38.57]You're going to get embarrassed.
[132:39.87]I'm about to perfect this person.
[132:48.52]Almost.
[132:49.88]Now I'm just BMing.
[132:50.60]That's enough.
[132:53.78]That's enough Mortal Kombat for today.
[132:56.15]That's enough Mortal Kombat for today.
[132:58.47]Turn it off.
[132:59.37]Bye-bye.
[133:09.76]What?
[133:10.04]Where did you come from?
[133:10.78]Keep up the pressure in this dude's dome.
[133:25.27]I hate this dude.
[133:26.87]This guy's the worst.
[133:33.35]I got it.
[133:34.71]I got to focus this dude now.
[133:55.94]Oh, not good.
[133:56.58]Bad, bad, bad, bad, bad.
[134:05.92]If I have to kill this guy, I will.
[134:17.93]What falls up must come down?
[134:21.79]What planet are we on?
[134:34.76]Good hit.
[134:38.90]Come on, I got double teamed there.
[134:40.32]Man, you haven't healed me one time all game.
[134:45.72]Benched.
[134:55.43]Stop being toxic.
[134:57.61]Benched.
[134:57.93]I'm not going to use this yet.
[135:03.95]Unless I need to.
[135:04.63]Heal me!
[135:15.04]Heal me!
[135:18.99]Get over here and heal me now!
[135:20.81]Do you even have a healer character with you?
[135:23.55]I've had enough.
[135:29.30]Finally!
[135:30.18]You did it!
[135:43.07]Fuck no!
[135:46.07]It's not over. And it won't be.
[135:56.07]What happened to my guy? What happened to my guy?
[136:00.00]I'm dead.
[136:04.00]I'm never using mana ever again.
[136:05.96]Ana walked around in circles.
[136:08.00]Didn't do anything because all she has is support characters.
[136:10.56]And then injected me with one heal over the whole course of the entire round.
[136:13.58]Benched.
[136:14.12]Permanently.
[136:14.46]That was too easy.
[136:17.49]Philosophically speaking, this had to happen.
[136:21.75]He's right.
[136:23.51]I mean, the quantum theory, whatever he's talking about.
[136:32.58]I lost the opportunity.
[136:35.88]Of course, I picked mana for that opportunity, and it's gone.
[136:53.91]Reload the save.
[136:55.07]No.
[136:56.74]He's flaming mana.
[136:58.04]Yeah, I am.
[136:58.90]I was holding up the Earth there.
[137:07.10]I'm keeping this now.
[137:08.52]Somebody's gotta go.
[137:16.96]No, we're gonna keep it.
[137:24.53]Beat the Death Eye unit.
[137:42.28]Ref, it's the eight-year-old's fault.
[137:44.64]Yes, it was.
[137:46.64]If I'm playing a game with children, and one of the children doesn't play well, then it was the child's fault.
[137:53.64]I didn't do it.
[137:59.00]I have 650 points in the game of basketball we're playing.
[138:05.82]By the way, the other team has one.
[138:08.28]They got a safety.
[138:10.50]Or we... No.
[138:11.14]That would... That would imply that one of them got, like, pushed over.
[138:14.04]Uh, no.
[138:15.50]They got... Somebody... No.
[138:17.32]They have zero points.
[138:30.14]Oh, dude.
[138:30.78]Okay.
[138:37.63]What?
[138:39.82]Oh, I kind of like this character.
[138:42.54]Where do I get one?
[138:54.83]Oh, come on.
[138:55.57]I guess he jumped over it.
[139:02.02]Do they have melee?
[139:04.18]Oh, alright.
[139:04.98]I gotta kill that guy now.
[139:10.23]This is horrible.
[139:15.40]They can all do it.
[139:19.94]Do I have to activate the superpower with this?
[139:21.60]I might.
[139:24.87]Okay, this is...
[139:53.35]Now I remember.
[139:56.05]She has one of the best spammable super moves.
[140:05.15]X-A, X-A, X-X-A.

[141:25.50]Unless, hold on.

[174:12.17]I'm going to get two.
[174:20.14]Stop.
[174:25.59]It's just you, right?
[174:26.85]Alright.
[174:27.13]Just the big guy.
[174:31.94]Ah, I tried to jump over it.
[174:32.86]Shit.
[174:33.06]Okay, who's left?
[174:33.70]Oh, it's over.
[174:36.24]I win.
[174:54.69]Hmm.
[174:55.33]Well, now you're little.
[174:57.19]Sorry.
[174:58.53]All your power is gone.
[175:02.16]Who's the real cheater here?
[175:03.10]When are you gonna do another Hearthstone stream?
[175:12.62]That was a pog face.
[175:13.60]Uh... That's not gonna happen.
[175:20.86]Alright, give me an... Finally.
[175:22.31]Capsule.
[175:22.71]Let's go.
[175:24.83]Complete a capsule.
[175:30.09]Do I have another one of these?
[175:36.49]I have so many singles.
[175:38.75]God damn it.
[175:39.43]It's like playing the Monopoly game at McDonald's.
[175:41.50]Give me a break.
[175:48.12]Drop by tribe?
[175:52.98]I'm never gonna win.
[176:01.74]He's got five community subs from Westule.
[176:04.50]Thank you, Westule.
[176:07.16]Appreciate the five subs.
[176:10.10]And add one of these little guys.
[176:12.78]Welcome, thanks for the subs.
[176:14.30]Welcome all the new subs.
[176:15.92]And welcome all the new mods.
[176:19.51]New mods, please say hello.
[176:27.41]Uh, this way.
[176:34.67]How do I... Crunchy Cookie?
[176:36.47]I don't know.
[176:36.83]I missed it.
[176:40.42]Big boy.
[176:40.84]I need a new trailer.
[176:45.00]Can I copy the big guy?
[176:45.76]Right?
[176:47.56]I should be able to copy this guy, right?
[176:49.80]Can I copy anything in the game?
[176:57.55]Whoa.
[177:01.63]This is cool.
[177:02.25]It only has one move.
[177:05.66]This is a bad thing to copy.
[177:06.70]This thing's terrible.
[177:13.49]Copy that guy.
[177:17.49]Wait, should I cop- You're even worse!
[177:20.47]Wait, what is this?
[177:22.32]Oh, he's cool!
[177:24.06]I like this guy!
[177:25.74]Like the ba-ba-bum-bum-bum with the two hands!
[177:35.31]It's actually fun.
[177:46.80]Aww, it's alright.
[177:47.36]You know why I like this game so much?
[177:59.13]Whoa, how come you like this so much?
[178:00.57]What's going on here?
[178:01.33]I just love projectiles.
[178:04.84]I love projectiles with travel time.
[178:08.70]It's my favorite thing in any game.
[178:20.56]Especially a third-person or first-person game.
[178:24.88]This reminds me.
[178:25.50]When the hell am I going to play Tribes?
[178:30.23]When are we going to play Tribes?
[178:32.39]Is the server still on?
[178:33.35]That game was so much fun.
[178:48.08]We had five more community subs from Sarbrus.
[178:52.57]Thank you, Sarbrus.
[178:54.85]For dropping those subs.
[178:55.59]Appreciate it.
[178:58.58]I just hit every auto attack.
[179:01.85]It's so good.
[179:07.83]First and third are the only two options, right?
[179:18.10]Yeah, well, 2D, right?
[179:20.18]Like, side scroller.
[179:30.85]What am I thinking of?
[179:33.35]Bird's eye, yeah, bird's eye, side-scrolling.
[179:37.85]But the projectiles have to travel.
[179:40.24]And have to be able to travel in real physics.
[179:46.30]I wish I could copy that guy.
[179:47.72]How do I get that guy?
[179:48.50]The double R. Look at those two bowling balls.
[179:52.17]Oh my goodness.
[179:52.95]Please give me this guy at the end of this.
[179:56.07]That's just the shield bubble butt guy except way cooler.
[180:01.26]He just has two.
[180:02.58]I want this guy.
[180:03.18]Please give it to me.
[180:15.71]I want to play tribes again.
[180:16.65]The best part about tribes is when you hit that blue plate special and you were just 7 million years away and you would just go up in the air and you'd go like... It's like, holy... I killed that guy.
[180:31.42]Playtime is over.
[180:32.32]Good.
[180:32.48]Go!
[180:32.54]Yeah!
[180:43.92]I just did this whole thing with, um, girl.
[180:49.68]Commander.
[180:58.86]Blue Plate Special was the best.
[181:00.98]And the soldier had that arcing grenade launcher.
[181:03.72]That game was so much fun.
[181:08.10]Do they make games like that anymore?
[181:09.58]Is there a game that... Think of what I feel about Tribes Ascend.
[181:14.78]I want a game that is that.
[181:17.34]No.
[181:18.24]Oh well.
[181:27.12]And we didn't get anything from that last experience.
[181:29.98]I'm going to change this up a bit.
[181:33.04]I remember I was using negative.
[181:40.59]Put negative back in here.
[181:46.83]Tribes is cool, but never got updated.
[181:49.67]I think, but wasn't the problem with tribes that it got updated, but they put a bunch of weird, dumb shit in the game that nobody wanted?
[181:54.61]Going robots.
[182:03.08]Putting hitscan in tribes.
[182:17.62]Where's the true hitscan in Tribes?
[182:20.87]Where are the machine guns?
[182:23.37]But weren't the machine guns even projectiles?
[182:25.77]You had to still land them?
[182:34.62]Sniper was hitscan?
[182:36.52]Really?
[182:39.94]Dumb.
[182:50.56]I think people, you know, I bet you there was just an appetite for something like that, like a real revival of that kind of game.
[183:02.15]Just all projectile-based, satisfying shots.
[183:08.61]Well, there isn't.
[183:11.02]Yeah, but this, I'm telling you, this shit comes in cycles, man.
[183:14.36]Remember when every single person was making a MOBA?
[183:19.00]Everyone.
[183:21.12]If you were a game company and you did not have a top-down MOBA in development, what the fuck were you doing with your life?
[183:29.44]That's now become VR.
[183:32.03]Did that thing explode?
[183:35.49]Oh, I'm going to copy this guy.
[183:45.07]BR is currently, like, the trend right now.
[183:47.67]It's really popular.
[183:49.33]But it's not going to be there forever.
[183:52.65]When's, like, the Tribes Ascend game going to be the... You know, that's what I'm looking for.
[183:56.32]There we go.
[184:04.30]No, I don't want this guy.
[184:05.26]This guy sucks.
[184:09.23]Maybe in 50 years.
[184:10.97]I don't think so.
[184:20.91]Oh, fuck.
[184:23.26]I want to turn into this guy.
[184:27.06]Shit.
[184:32.74]Oh, I got it.
[184:33.62]Okay, what is this thing?
[184:37.58]He has like pulsating shots.
[184:40.38]Oh, I'd love to see what the fuck was going on.
[184:45.61]Wait, was he about to do the bigger they are, the harder they fall?
[184:50.50]in the same tone?
[184:52.96]Why didn't we get to hear that?
[185:01.52]We were almost there!
[185:02.96]The bigger they are, the harder they fall!
[185:18.19]I'm just trying to snipe this guy out.
[185:20.09]Seems to be working.
[185:25.00]Let's use it.
[185:33.14]Jump!
[185:34.06]Jump!
[185:43.17]Oh, that was a cool hero.
[185:46.55]Too bad.
[185:49.27]This is impossible from the point of cultural anthropology!
[185:53.35]There he is again.
[185:53.93]He's probably going to be that weird bubble guy.
[186:06.38]Another thunder robot?
[186:07.78]Are you shitting me?
[186:10.26]No!
[186:12.04]Boo hoo!
[186:13.44]I don't know.
[186:16.89]Fucking thunder robot.
[186:18.75]Are you shitting me?
[186:20.69]I'm going to the warehouse.
[186:35.69]What does that mean?
[186:43.17]I'm going to... No.
[186:44.94]This is too weird.
[186:47.12]Too much setup time.
[186:48.88]Too much setup time, too expensive.
[186:51.84]There's my boy right there.
[186:54.80]Never mind.
[186:55.56]Sit back down.
[187:02.10]Melting them down.
[187:05.06]Wait.
[187:07.75]Hold on.
[187:10.25]I changed my mind.
[187:17.46]I'm gonna turn into a huge ship.
[187:18.88]Or a satellite or something.
[187:21.52]Oh, but in the meantime... You know, I'm going back to... I haven't played with these guys in a long time.
[187:33.46]250.
[187:34.62]And then... 150.
[187:36.32]Wait, save it.
[187:44.04]Well... Right?
[187:52.67]Do an angry video game nerd impression?
[188:04.26]The problem is, it's just donkey shit.
[188:07.48]It's like the smelliest donkey shit you've ever seen in your entire life.
[188:13.28]Now, look at this guy.
[188:14.52]This guy just sucks.
[188:15.96]This game sucks.
[188:17.13]Is that right?
[188:27.79]That was alright.
[188:30.05]Hey guys, fun thing about the Angry Video Game Nerd.
[188:34.81]You know, he's like the D&D of YouTubers.
[188:37.83]You know that, right?
[188:49.32]He was doing that shit fucking like 20 years ago.
[188:55.36]The Witcher 3 is a great game, but D&D is the reason why The Witcher 3 even exists.
[188:59.38]It's clear how this is going to end.
[189:05.27]Whoa, look at this!
[189:13.22]what come on I can't do this oh that's that's not cool I gotta play as one of these eye of kill rogs oh that's great might as I can't even fly well you know what to do
[189:46.25]Oh, look at all those blue plate specials.
[189:55.57]Actually, pretty good character to be here.
[189:57.64]Everyone was like, what do you have to say now?
[190:30.82]Extra super powerful.
[190:32.04]What does it look like?
[190:32.74]What does it look like?
[190:34.76]It looks like a Mega Man shot.
[190:37.71]No.
[190:37.87]What does it look like?
[190:38.45]It looks like something from a game.
[190:44.35]He did a lot of work.
[190:56.66]I forget just how much health that just brought the GF down.
[191:03.23]Buster shots from Mega Man Legends.
[191:04.71]It kind of does, yeah.
[191:05.49]I mean, this is a Capcom game.
[191:07.01]If you guys didn't know, this game is Capcom.
[191:09.85]It was made by the same people that made Resident Evil 7.
[191:15.13]Maybe it's not Capcom.
[191:19.97]Yeah, it is.
[191:25.81]That's my best score yet, I think.
[191:40.68]Yes!
[191:41.98]Finally!
[191:42.45]A fucking plane!
[191:44.43]They also made Resident Evil 6?
[191:45.67]Nah, they outsourced that.
[191:48.45]That wasn't made by Capcom.
[191:52.01]You guys know Aliens Colonial Marines?
[191:56.02]The game wasn't even made by Gearbox.
[192:03.62]You got a death crystal.
[192:07.75]Looks like some kind of key data.
[192:15.25]Blue striker.
[192:17.45]Fastest thing in the game.
[192:19.12]No attack?
[192:19.84]How?
[192:21.77]Missile, Vulcan, Power Beam.
[192:24.82]Not expensive either.
[192:25.30]Let's lead with that.
[192:25.74]I'll keep you here for a while.
[192:50.65]390 remain.
[192:51.79]180.
[193:03.32]I got six people now.
[193:06.72]Cool.
[193:16.43]He's no good at the Valkyries.
[193:17.87]No, not really.
[193:21.27]What is this?
[193:21.87]A mysterious crystal.
[193:23.38]Ooh, here comes lore.
[193:24.88]I got some strange data.
[193:28.44]Watch out, it's the Death Force.
[193:40.24]Here we go.
[193:42.74]Plane time.
[193:46.75]Whoa.
[193:49.45]Cool.
[193:50.11]How do I...
[193:52.08]Wait.
[193:52.50]You can hold... Missiles.
[194:02.61]Wow!
[194:04.19]What's the charge do?
[194:14.31]Volley.
[194:15.05]Ooh, dodge.
[194:15.55]One of those land.
[194:19.58]Oh.
[194:22.24]That was fun though.
[194:30.85]They had some good anti-air.
[194:31.81]That's the reason why it happened.
[194:37.37]We both have this.
[194:38.21]This is cool.
[194:43.38]Don't think so.
[194:45.78]Watch this shit.
[194:53.50]We just quad-ninja'd this person.
[195:06.49]Get it!
[195:07.03]You're too fast!
[195:07.71]Alright, back it up.
[195:22.28]Do I hear a dragon?
[195:25.34]I do.
[195:27.50]You already killed my buddy.
[195:35.05]Nice shot.
[195:36.21]You got it.
[195:36.83]Come on.
[195:37.11]You got to give credit.
[195:45.29]Who else is here?
[195:49.34]Shit.
[195:57.53]No!
[196:06.12]That wasn't even... That... What?
[196:09.32]What a 3,000 GF power.
[196:13.96]Holy shit.
[196:15.04]Okay.
[196:15.18]Okay.
[196:25.89]Okay.
[196:26.01]What do we got?
[196:28.00]Sniper.
[196:35.56]Is this a boss battle?
[196:44.63]I didn't say it was.
[196:45.47]I don't think it is.
[196:53.59]Save that power, though.
[197:01.83]Got me too.
[197:09.56]Holy fuck, he's still playing this.
[197:10.96]It's not that long.
[197:12.76]I mean, I know my streams turned into like four to five hours long, but I mean, not like that.
[197:21.05]It's not like that long.
[197:30.36]Somebody said this is Warframe.
[197:33.58]But imagine if it was a cartoon like this.
[197:50.95]I would like that.
[197:52.81]It really isn't.
[197:59.94]Another dragon.
[198:07.10]Ooh, risky, but worth it.
[198:17.35]Copy the dragon, please.
[198:18.47]I don't have the copy guy right now.
[198:22.69]Is he even on the team?
[198:35.09]Turn it on!
[198:35.69]No, he's not.
[198:45.85]Bye.
[198:52.68]I look over and you guys are doing fucking crazy shit.
[198:59.54]I like the plane, but it's very vulnerable.
[199:01.14]You have to really fly the hell out of there.
[199:07.79]Ooh.
[199:09.49]Wire girl.
[199:15.90]Are they looking for this?
[199:18.82]Got a death crystal.
[199:20.14]How many death crystals do I need?
[199:22.99]Got two.
[199:37.85]I mean, she looks cool.
[199:40.47]D, though.
[199:41.73]Charge gun, beam knife, charge beam, anchor wire.
[199:45.53]Wire girl was trained on a secret agent.
[199:48.53]Once her anchor wire is set, she can return to a set point at any time.
[199:53.60]Very useful when she needs to make a sharp exit.
[199:55.96]That's really good.
[199:57.40]That's like teleporting, but better.
[199:58.54]I'll try it.
[200:02.12]What's the cost?
[200:03.46]220?
[200:03.48]That's pretty good.
[200:16.86]Alright, here we go.
[200:18.72]Death Commander.
[200:22.73]Who should I bring?
[200:23.69]Alright, Manny, you get one more shot.
[200:25.43]Off the bench.
[200:25.99]Let's go.
[200:35.86]Fly away.
[200:46.14]Are they homing?
[200:46.70]Okay, I just hit myself with my own missile.
[200:49.26]How is that even possible?
[200:54.56]No, your ship is so much better than mine.
[201:01.76]Bombing run.
[201:04.86]Okay, anchor point.
[201:07.72]How does this work?
[201:18.11]How do I... How does this work?
[201:30.11]Ooh.
[201:35.77]You can go back to any point?
[201:37.13]I don't understand.
[201:39.69]Oh.
[201:44.88]Wait a minute.
[201:45.80]You... Okay, you have to fly... You fly near it.
[201:50.46]Wait a second.
[201:51.20]Hold on.
[201:51.76]Okay, now I... This is the first time I've ever used this fucking character.
[201:56.04]How did I... Oh, I got hit by the... I think I got hit by the... Oh, this one sucks.
[202:14.86]There's too many of them.
[202:18.06]Oh, I sure would love to be healed by the best character in the game.
[202:22.57]I have a support character that doesn't do anything.
[202:27.23]Spends all the time walking around in circles and missing me.
[202:33.52]Okay, heal me now.
[202:40.14]Get over here.
[202:42.18]What on Earth are you do- Come here!
[202:45.20]Heal me!
[202:48.17]Heal me!
[202:50.17]You don't have any other- Finally!
[202:52.11]That character doesn't even have any fucking moves!
[203:14.76]You gonna heal me or what?
[203:20.71]That's something that somebody on the bench would say.
[203:44.03]Kill it!
[203:46.70]Kill it!
[203:51.03]That's it!
[203:53.47]Now you're in big trouble.
[204:02.60]Now you're in trouble.
[204:16.73]You got a heal for me?
[204:19.27]Oh shit, it's a nuke.
[204:22.22]Shoot it!
[204:25.80]Mana run.
[204:27.30]Mana, mana, mana, mana.
[204:29.16]Thank god.
[204:29.70]Alright, we all did it.
[204:41.14]Whoa, what?
[204:50.42]Tactical nuke.
[204:52.54]Hope I get one right here.
[204:53.30]Ooh.
[204:58.12]I mean, yeah.
[204:59.50]That has to.
[205:01.54]That's going into the crew.
[205:08.05]You're useless, Tama.
[205:09.23]I gave you the power of the death arc, but you still lost.
[205:11.85]What are you talking about?
[205:15.33]Death arc was not strong enough.
[205:22.44]What's that area?
[205:23.80]350.
[205:23.86]That's pretty solid.
[205:29.02]Bug Borg.
[205:31.72]Insect Bomb.
[205:32.85]Insect Slicer.
[205:33.87]Insect Scope.
[205:36.81]Mech life form from outer space.
[205:38.81]Its gate shield protects it from enemy attacks while its right arm is sharp as a blade.
[205:43.53]Its insect scope reduces the power of enemy shots.
[205:47.59]D-Buff.
[205:50.52]That's right.
[205:53.50]wire girl on here too.
[206:10.26]The shame the toys never happen, the designs in the game kick ass.
[206:17.66]I mean, they're pretty, they are pretty good.
[206:19.46]They're pretty cool.
[206:22.67]I would have loved to play with these things.
[206:37.86]Fund it.
[206:40.02]What does that have to fund?
[206:44.20]Weren't you like 20 when this came out?
[206:47.90]Well, I mean, I was, yeah, I was like, no, I was like fucking 18 or something, 17.
[206:55.38]That's besides the point.
[206:57.04]I'm talking about if I was like younger and played this when I was like 10.
[206:59.38]I would have been sick.
[207:01.91]What does the charge do?
[207:09.11]It does a huge one.
[207:11.97]Okay, I just found...
[207:16.51]nice it's so good alright don't crash alright missiles damn this thing looks really good can you imagine flying around like this with 10
[207:47.44]You would shit your pants if you played this when you were like 12.
[207:52.34]Look at those thick, thick beams.
[208:20.13]Retreat.
[208:31.34]Can't dodge that.
[208:32.72]Oh, it's alright.
[208:34.08]Okay, here we go.
[208:34.58]Bug.
[208:35.28]The bug guy.
[208:42.93]Oh, shit.
[208:43.53]He's got recharge, huh?
[208:48.49]Did I do it?
[208:54.93]I'm kind of hard to tell what's going on here.
[209:07.50]He doesn't suck.
[209:08.66]I just don't understand yet.
[209:11.88]It's these fields that he's shooting at.
[209:27.40]It's a debuff field, right?
[209:30.15]Itchy guy.
[209:30.51]Alright, I still don't understand how this works.
[209:44.30]I'm trying to get this to activate somehow.
[209:46.84]X doesn't do it.
[209:47.40]I have to, like, touch them?
[209:48.28]Double tap X?
[209:54.36]Okay.
[209:54.96]That makes sense.
[209:59.89]Just mash buttons!
[210:04.28]Okay, that's good.
[210:04.88]Let's put them across the whole map.
[210:16.93]Yeah, this is gonna be great.
[210:17.69]Ready?
[210:23.55]Oop, the game broke.
[210:32.02]Does she have a melee?
[210:34.66]Yeah, and it's pretty good.
[210:35.50]It's quick.
[210:47.41]Back up.
[210:50.25]I think that's just a really good character.
[210:51.69]That's the reason why my bug guy was just not fair.
[210:54.07]This guy's a limited edition.
[210:58.63]Fog guy's a common.
[210:59.49]He's like a D or something.
[211:00.97]This guy's probably like an S. I won the record for oldest person to play this game.
[211:21.19]That's fine.
[211:23.79]That doesn't embarrass me.
[211:25.49]Why would that... This game's cool.
[211:29.20]It's a really neat game, and I want to showcase.
[211:31.74]It's Showcase Saturday.
[211:36.22]We're checking out this old showcase-able game that's really fun, and really, I wish they'd make games like this.
[211:42.93]Again.
[211:43.17]Look at this showcase.
[211:50.04]No, it's not.
[211:50.48]It's Tuesday.
[211:51.20]It's Tuesday.
[211:51.78]It's Tuesday.
[211:53.14]You guys still don't understand how time zones work.
[211:59.40]Can you imagine if the Earth was like 50 times larger than it is?
[212:02.34]And it could be like Thursday for you and it's like Monday for me.
[212:22.25]You'd be stuck in a time loop.
[212:23.61]Days would just be longer.
[212:27.70]But would we have longer days?
[212:30.14]Would a day be like 75?
[212:32.00]Like, what?
[212:32.76]One day would be like a week?
[212:39.27]If the Earth was a hundred times bigger than it is now, we might rotate slower.
[212:52.49]Thank God I got one.
[212:56.29]He's learning?
[212:59.97]gravity would kill us if the Earth was okay if the Earth was like okay if if how long it takes for you to get from like let's say like New York to London right was it like a eight hour flight 11 hour flight imagine okay so if you want to go from like a New York to London it was like four days in an airplane
[213:31.65]Like, the ocean was 50 times larger.
[213:34.23]What would happen?
[213:35.27]The Earth is still the Earth.
[213:41.50]Like, we have the same amount of countries in the same places, but there's just way more ocean.
[213:48.76]Is the mass still the same?
[213:50.64]Yeah, like, the mass of the countries is the same, but the ocean is like 6 million times bigger.
[214:05.98]Do I have to draw this?
[214:06.96]I might have to draw this for you.
[214:09.59]Do I have to draw this?
[214:13.79]I don't think people understand what I'm saying here.
[214:17.62]Hold on.
[214:21.72]What?
[214:21.98]Hold on.
[214:22.46]Wait, wait, wait.
[214:23.18]This is important.
[214:37.05]Okay, so this is what I'm talking about.
[214:42.67]If you... Let me just clean for you so you can see it nice and good.
[214:57.55]What?
[214:59.55]It's paint.
[215:00.88]Of course it is.
[215:01.64]Who cares?
[215:02.80]Look, I'm going to fix it.
[215:03.98]I'll fix it here.
[215:04.82]See, now your eyes won't hurt.
[215:07.92]Okay, I gotta get this music out of my ear.
[215:09.44]It's gonna fucking make me scream.
[215:11.80]Okay, so here's Earth.
[215:13.25]I'm gonna draw you Earth.
[215:14.35]Here's Earth as it is now, right?
[215:18.20]So this is Earth.
[215:19.80]And then, like, here's, uh, this is Africa.
[215:24.94]This is, like, North America.
[215:27.20]Uh, this is, uh, this is Europe, right?
[215:33.43]Italy.
[215:35.03]And then over here is, like, on the other side, I can't draw it, is, like, you know, China and Russia and stuff, okay?
[215:41.33]Under here is South America.
[215:42.77]But remember, it's, um, just, you just know where it is.
[215:44.32]Alright, so this is what the Earth looks like now.
[215:47.78]So, what happens... And here's the sun, right?
[215:51.38]So, here's the sun.
[215:54.80]Obviously, now the Earth is spinning.
[215:58.13]Like this, right?
[215:58.87]Spin, spin, spin.
[216:00.15]Here's the sun.
[216:02.25]Sun also goes, like, in a circle.
[216:04.95]Or something.
[216:05.39]I don't know.
[216:05.71]I mean, sad planet.
[216:11.23]No, we go in a circle.
[216:12.39]We go in a circle.
[216:13.41]That's where the circle is.
[216:14.57]So we circle like this.
[216:15.79]What?
[216:16.07]Give me a different color.
[216:17.45]I don't want fucking puke orange.
[216:21.47]What the?
[216:22.09]Stop.
[216:25.02]What the fuck?
[216:25.74]Alright, so we're going like this, but we're also going like this.
[216:34.00]So what happens in this scenario?
[216:36.45]How do I...
[216:38.74]Something's wrong with my computer.
[216:40.72]Something has to be wrong with my computer.
[216:42.10]That doesn't make any sense.
[216:54.64]Something has to be wrong with the computer.
[216:57.00]Is that Eraser?
[217:02.12]I'm going to try to do this as detailed as I can.
[217:09.49]Okay, I'm sorry.
[217:11.35]I'll fix it.
[217:13.71]So what happens when you have the Earth like this?
[217:17.98]So here's the Earth.
[217:22.12]That's the Earth.
[217:23.54]Here's the sun.
[217:25.56]Right here.
[217:29.45]And now here is... Here's North America.
[217:36.03]Here is South America.
[217:42.09]Here's Africa.
[217:46.70]Here's Europe.
[217:50.68]And then on the other side is, right?
[217:55.44]Where's Mexico?
[217:56.34]Down here.
[217:56.72]You know what I'm saying?
[217:59.22]So what happens?
[218:00.96]We're rotating like this, and we're also going like this.
[218:08.45]What happens if the Earth is like 60 times bigger?
[218:10.83]Wait, would we not have any sunlight?
[218:13.23]Would it just be... Okay, would there only be sunlight like here?
[218:19.11]Only?
[218:20.05]Like in one country?
[218:25.85]If the sun was like tiny, would it be like a flashlight on one country at a time?
[218:32.49]And with everybody else being pitch black until it finally like moved a little bit and like it finally okay now this right here This parking gets some sunlight That's not how light works, but would it just be darker Would you would it would it just would the would it be darker outside would we went enough big sunshine it would be darker It'd be harsh shadows
[219:11.19]So, what if all the countries are like this?
[219:14.36]In the same spot over here.
[219:15.28]Like, typically, this is where Earth is now.
[219:18.60]Right?
[219:19.14]Imagine this is Earth.
[219:20.78]And there's the countries.
[219:21.72]Imagine they all were in there.
[219:23.92]Would we have, like, a day of sunlight and then, like, 12 days of darkness?
[219:33.37]Yes, we would.
[219:39.64]Big Earth theory.
[219:40.64]That's not how days work.
[219:43.98]Yeah, but like, our perception of darkness would be longer.
[219:48.16]It would be long- it would be darker for longer.
[219:49.70]Our pre- like, it would be like, holy shit, it's dark for so fucking long.
[219:57.44]Even though it's, you know, yeah.
[220:00.51]Just like it is when you play Minecraft.
[220:05.25]I'm of the opinion that in Minecraft, the nights are longer and it's been coded that way.
[220:09.76]I've been told it's not true, but it is.
[220:11.08]Concludes my... What if the Earth was big theory?
[220:27.81]Oh, you know there's some science channel that's made a video about what if the Earth was fucking a thousand times bigger.
[220:35.54]Don't act like I'm some kind of psycho.
[221:20.99]grammarly ensures your writing is mistake free and clear hey just who cares how bad your spell just spam your keyboard and then the computer will fix it for you the better we can just mash keys you can do this when you're shit drunk hey there welcome to life nugget we live in a part of the solar system called the goldilocks zone
[221:42.30]Shh, quiet.
[221:42.62]It's not too hot that all the water evaporates away, but it's also not too cold where it freezes instead.
[221:48.39]And unless you're an astronaut, the big spherical rock will be your home for life.
[221:53.62]But what if that home suddenly changed?
[221:55.80]What if in a split second the Earth doubled in size?
[221:58.87]Let's just write the density remains constant.
[222:01.21]So the mass of the Earth increased as well.
[222:03.55]How would that change things?
[222:05.27]Well, first off gravity would be very different The Earth would have eight times as much mass and gravity would be twice as strong.
[222:12.68]So if you step I said ten times much harder for you to walk and you get tired much more Another version of yourself a piggyback ride all day all
[222:27.34]Over the years, human bones, especially in the legs, would have to become stronger to support this increased weight.
[222:34.49]Meanwhile, trees would start to collapse, and any new trees that grow in their place might not grow as tall.
[222:40.63]See, there's a limit for how tall a tree can grow.
[222:43.51]usually around 400 feet or so.
[222:45.63]This limit is determined by gravity.
[222:47.59]Since the taller the tree is, the more energy is required to transport water from the roots to the top.
[222:52.68]If the amount of energy the tree gains from photosynthesis is more than the energy it takes to transport the water, it'll keep growing.
[222:59.34]Otherwise, it'll stop.
[223:00.80]So, if the Earth suddenly got twice as big, trees like the California Redwood may not be as impressive.
[223:07.28]Luckily, even though the gravitational pull of the Earth will be stronger, it still won't be enough to break the moon apart.
[223:13.39]See, in order for that to happen, the Moon would have to be within the Earth's Roche limit.
[223:17.73]This is the minimum distance the Moon can approach the Earth without being torn apart by tidal forces.
[223:22.89]This happens because the near side of the Moon is pulled in harder than the far side.
[223:27.25]When the Moon gets close enough to the Earth, the gravity holding it together is overcome by this cosmic tug.
[223:32.76]Inside that limit, Earth's gravity will tear the Moon apart, giving us a ring like those around Saturn.
[223:38.64]Oh, and the more Earth there is, the more it will heat up.
[223:42.32]See, if there are more unstable elements in the crust and interior, more heat will reach the surface and there may be much more volcanic activity.
[223:50.53]And I don't know about you, but I'd rather not live in a world where there's a constant threat of an exploding volcano.
[223:55.37]Oh wait, are we already living in that?
[223:57.17]I'm looking at you, Yellowstone.
[223:59.06]Anyway, if you could live anywhere in the universe, no limitations, where would it be and why?
[224:04.88]If I could, I'd totally live in Jupiter's great red spot.
[224:07.78]It'd be pretty dangerous.
[224:10.05]Alright.
[224:11.21]That doesn't answer my question.
[224:19.05]What happens to the sun?
[224:20.03]What happens to our sun?
[224:36.05]We live in strange times.
[224:41.41]for 200 years now, starting with Thomas Robert Malthus.
[224:46.21]Demographers have been sounding the alarm that there isn't enough space and resources on Earth and that there's an oversupply of people.
[224:54.23]But what if the Earth belonged to the class of planets called super Earths and had a mass and size two or even 10 times larger?
[225:03.69]Would it solve all of our problems?
[225:06.35]Or on the contrary, would terrible consequences await us?
[225:12.71]According to the assumptions of Mickey Rosenthal from the University of California, Santa Cruz, our planet had every chance of becoming a super Earth, but this was prevented by Jupiter, which blocked the Earth's access to additional building material that could have made it much larger.
[225:31.79]If it weren't for Jupiter, the Earth would have grown, and almost everything on our planet would have shrunk several times over.
[225:39.00]And this is not a matter of proportions at all, but one of enhanced gravity.
[225:45.18]To increase to 100 on a super Earth with double Earth's mass, your weight would increase to 150 kilograms or 330 pounds.
[225:55.91]and up to 750 kilograms or 1,650 pounds is almost 10 times greater than the was close to that of Kepler-20b part of the core.
[226:09.17]This means that the magnetic field protecting us from solar wind
[226:14.02]could disappear forever.
[226:16.44]Anyone who survived the frequent meteor showers would appear in such water.
[226:22.70]Due to the high pressure, the ocean floor would be covered with a thick layer of ice, which would make the carbon cycle and mineral exchange between the atmosphere and the bowels of the planet impossible.
[226:36.44]in fact according to hilke schlichting from the university of California Los Angeles if our planet was a super Earth all the water would simply evaporate according to her assumption the super Earth would rotate much closer to the sun in orbit making a complete revolution in only 100 days such an orbit is considered habitable if the star is smaller than our sun
[227:03.86]but at such a distance from our sun all the water on a super Earth would simply evaporate rodrigo luger from the center from computational astrophysics at the flatiron institute suggests that all super earths evaporate except that instead of steam they turn into liquid water he believes that super earths are formed from separate pieces of ice
[227:29.52]Then they migrate closer to their star.
[227:32.60]The ice melts and an ocean appears, completely covering the surface of the planet.
[227:38.69]Perhaps such planets are the most common in the universe.
[227:42.35]Among the more than 4,000 exoplanets discovered by the Kepler Space Telescope, about 30% fall in the Super Earth class.
[227:51.88]If we want to migrate in search of a better place to live,
[227:55.72]we need to focus exclusively on super earths after all the remaining 70 percent truth it's not a super Earth its theoretical mass and size are not much larger than our earths however all zone is much closer okay Diana kosakowski a researcher at the max plank institute for astronomy in Germany believes there may be liquid water on planet gj357d
[228:24.07]So she plans to search for other signs of life on it in the near future.
[228:29.25]A little further, at a distance of 39 light years from Earth, is another super Earth.
[228:35.81]GJ180D.
[228:36.71]I told you this was fucking happening!
[228:39.69]Everybody, do you... Listen to me.
[228:44.97]Three or four hours ago, I was talking about how many fucking Earths existed.
[228:49.16]There's a shitload of Earths.
[228:50.48]We're one of like a million Earths.
[228:52.81]Everybody called me crazy.
[228:54.43]This guy has, like, a list of four of them already.
[228:57.63]It's 7.5 times larger than the Earth, but its main feature is unique.
[229:02.56]Most exoplanets are tidally locked, meaning the same side always faces its star like the moon towards the Earth.
[229:11.03]This makes it impossible to form the magnetic field necessary for stars together.
[229:15.83]A brown and a red dwarf.
[229:18.57]Still, scientists have found candidates for life among other types of planets.
[229:23.84]For example, K2-18b.
[229:26.78]It's considered a super-Earth, but its composition is more like a mini-Neptune.
[229:32.76]And weirdly enough, none of the inhabitants have noses.
[229:36.99]Trying to figure out science could not figure out why.
[229:40.87]and terrestrial planets.
[229:42.79]Many Neptunes have rocky cores hidden under a thick gas shell.
[229:48.31]Planet K2-18b has the mass of a super-Earth.
[229:53.37]But in this inter, life didn't appear on a super-Earth.
[229:57.20]but on offer to be honest give it a thumbs up don't forget to subscribe to the subscribe to done so already and if you like the video give it a thumbs up of life gj357d is not tied to its star therefore it has why do they name the planets like this
[230:19.91]Why wouldn't they call it like, I don't know, like Earth 5?
[230:25.05]Earth-like 10?
[230:25.77]Earth-like 20?
[230:26.68]Why is it like KGI-42BE1?
[230:33.74]Just say Earth-like 1 and just keep numbering them.
[230:47.85]It's literally trillions.
[230:49.19]So count to trillion.
[230:50.69]It's not like we don't have the numbers to count them.
[230:53.35]It could be Earth-like.
[230:54.41]E-L dash one zero zero zero whatever.
[230:59.08]You could hyphen it.
[231:00.08]You could change it.
[231:10.52]DC Comics Universe trademarked that idea.
[231:15.66]Watch TikTok compilations.
[231:17.00]Why the hell would I do that?
[231:17.90]Alright, let's go back to this.
[231:31.91]Can we watch more science?
[231:40.37]Name the eight planets without looking.
[231:41.81]Sure.
[231:43.85]Saturn, Jupiter, Neptune, and Earth, and Mars, Venus, and Mercury, and Jupiter.
[231:59.04]Did I miss one?
[232:01.75]I said Mars.
[232:10.13]Uranus.
[232:11.13]How could I forget the fucking comedy planet?
[232:15.12]A gacha board with supersonic powers.
[232:16.72]Enemies who are hit by his warp speed Sonic Nitoriu move don't even realize they've been hit until it's too late.
[232:22.85]They're dead.
[232:23.45]I'll give him a try.
[232:32.61]Where's he?
[232:38.16]Sonic Samurai.
[232:41.98]Sonic... Ooh.
[232:43.90]Ooh.
[232:47.30]Alright, we're going to have to take away Ant-Man.
[232:49.07]No, I want to test him out.

[244:19.17]Ooh.
[244:19.51]That's actually pretty good.
[244:21.55]Is that good enough, though, to justify having nothing else?
[244:25.84]That's all this guy has.
[244:46.67]I mean, it has a good recharge rate.
[244:48.75]Does he even have... Oh, no.

[248:34.77]I'm at the end.
[248:35.17]I need that helmet back.
[248:42.18]Who's my ally?
[248:42.82]Because they're kicking the shit out of this guy.
[248:47.76]Don't die.
[248:48.42]This is all he has.
[248:49.06]I have to get around him.
[249:01.13]I'm just doing supporting fire.
[249:02.17]He'll just go in and dive in and kill him.
[249:05.23]Wait, there's another person?
[249:05.99]Are we gonna play Devil May Cry 2?
[249:12.56]Um... I don't know.
[249:14.64]Imagine spawning in and getting hit right in the mouth and dying.
[249:24.37]That's too bad.
[249:34.11]Yes!
[249:42.56]Literally any one of them, but... This is the third claw robot.
[249:46.34]I don't want three of these.

[250:41.77]What are you- how do you- how the hell would you know that?
[250:51.03]Up until like 12 hours ago, you guys didn't even know this game existed.
[251:08.64]I want ship.
[251:10.13]I like ship.
[251:10.75]I want more ship.
[251:12.37]I want like three of them in a row.

[251:25.06]Is it time to beat things on Gacha Force?
[251:29.74]I'm not sure they would be.
[251:37.77]I mean it's like it's but there's only 12 to 30 hours Main story ten and a half main and extras 22 and a half I'm not just doing only story missions
[252:11.38]But you are.
[252:12.32]I'm not.
[252:12.70]Guys, you have to remember, we paused like three times to talk about fucking dog food.
[252:32.38]This has been at least a full probably 45 minutes of this stream.
[252:36.82]And the last one have been dog food conversations in quotes.
[252:49.96]Alright, I want... Send these to the warehouse.
[252:53.02]Fuck these things.
[252:56.22]He's taking up space.

[253:15.63]There you go.
[253:16.67]I'll use... Yeah, you're pretty good.
[253:25.15]Well, here's the thing.
[253:25.77]When I play it tomorrow, if I finish the game... When I finish the game, I'll probably finish the game tomorrow.
[253:30.67]If it's still... I'm not just going to stop streaming if it's only been a few hours.
[253:36.82]Like I said, we go... We're going to be going like four to six hours a stream.
[253:47.34]Defeat the special unit.

[254:36.34]And it fucking made me get hurt.
[254:55.13]I fucking can't even.

[265:44.36]Holy shit.
[265:49.94]I'm getting hit with everything.
[265:53.36]Alright, settle down.
[265:54.24]This thing's a fucking firework.
[265:57.01]What?!
[265:59.69]He's one of those fireworks that you sit on the ground and light.
[266:03.75]Like those fountain things.
[266:11.04]Bad matchup.
[266:12.12]What the fuck?! !
[266:16.06]Oh, because he... Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[266:20.04]It's alright.
[266:21.04]I'll get it right here.
[266:22.00]Just don't get anywhere near him.
[266:24.44]I mean the blast.
[266:27.67]That's probably it, right?
[266:30.07]Is there two of these?
[266:30.77]If there's two of these, this is going to be bad.
[266:36.23]Oh, there's like five of these, actually.
[266:37.57]There's probably four or five of these.
[266:42.09]I need fast flyers.
[267:00.40]Grandma, I know you want sex appeal for this dream, but I don't think the dragon's for you.
[267:09.72]That's funny.
[267:14.02]Alright, fast.
[267:19.68]You.

[267:29.57]Battle girls are fast.
[267:32.13]Valkyries fast.
[267:38.79]Other Valkyries are fast.
[267:45.72]This is going to be just about dashing around and flying around.
[267:47.92]Let's try it.
[268:06.67]You also need people that are fast, so you come on in.
[268:09.11]God damn it.

[277:05.63]It's an insta-dead.
[277:10.69]You gotta be all the way at his side or you're gonna get... And this doesn't matter.
[277:13.82]It's over.
[277:15.12]I've tried.
[277:16.22]And I'm dead.
[277:19.36]Alright, get over there and zap him!

[278:22.29]It's not that hard.
[278:22.77]Get up there.
[278:24.99]My head!
[278:25.43]Okay, X immediately.
[278:34.83]I'm pressing X the second the game starts.
[278:39.74]Oh, I gotta be the editor.
[278:57.40]Here we go.
[278:58.70]X immediately.
[279:21.59]Give me a fucking break.
[279:31.32]Does cover work?
[279:33.02]Find out right now.

[280:10.16]Okay.
[280:12.24]I'm gonna get... What am I gonna do?
[280:17.99]I don't think I can copy.
[280:19.09]I will try it though.
[280:39.66]Use the jet?
[280:41.36]The jet actually was pretty good.
[280:42.22]I wish I had more planes.
[280:43.00]I guess I could probably unlock them.
[280:46.00]Here.
[280:58.65]Okay, get over there and copy.
[281:07.29]It actually worked!
[281:09.03]It worked!
[281:12.07]No, how do I?
[281:14.77]It actually worked.
[281:15.81]That's unbelievable.
[281:17.03]I can do that.
[281:17.43]Where's the other one?
[281:22.91]That might be all I needed.
[281:23.65]Get the fuck out of the way.
[281:28.75]Forget about the head.
[281:29.25]Just get out of the way.
[281:31.03]He's going to fucking fire at you.
[281:32.53]How the fuck are you supposed to get the fuck?
[281:35.31]Come on.
[281:36.05]Battery man.
[281:37.85]Whatever you are, get over there.

[282:24.96]Is it B or X for the charge?
[282:26.16]I don't know.
[282:40.98]Did it fire?
[282:44.35]What is going on?
[282:46.46]Why can I not?
[282:59.39]I was holding X and then I got hit and all my health disappeared.
[283:37.44]Huh?
[283:40.46]I have to hold this.
[283:41.28]Wait, I have to hold... Fire attack!

[283:54.00]It worked.
[283:54.36]Okay.
[283:54.84]Is there any more of them?

[285:39.35]Alright, that... Oh, okay.
[285:43.46]It's foolproof.

[285:56.41]He sucks.
[286:07.84]Oh!

[288:33.32]We can edit that together and make it sound better.
[288:45.98]I'm going to stand still.
[288:48.02]The shield blocks attacks.
[288:49.80]Will it block this attack?
[288:52.00]That's the question.
[289:03.37]We found our ultimate counter.
[289:15.68]Get the fuck away from me.
[289:16.38]I have to be in front of him.
[289:17.50]No.

[290:59.78]No, I picked the wrong support.
[291:01.72]Like, it matters.
[291:03.78]I'm only picking this because this guy has a shield.
[291:19.53]Okay.
[291:27.76]Okay, close enough.
[291:28.44]Block.
[291:34.06]What, your shield not good enough to block?
[291:38.02]Wait, what?
[291:41.36]I blocked that shit.
[291:49.35]Oh, and maybe it only blocks energy attacks.
[291:51.37]Okay.
[292:11.75]Nice!
[292:12.23]Where's the other one?
[292:17.47]Is this thing firing anymore?

[293:25.67]Alright, if I throw the head, I'll take 50% damage off of him.
[293:41.36]And then he shoots me and I explode and die because he fills the whole map with a radar beam.
[293:48.27]Just build a fucking army with low-cost units.
[293:50.80]I'll try that.
[293:51.30]Peasant army?
[294:10.00]Oh wait, they're in the warehouse.

[297:29.27]They can't kill us all Together we are massive
[297:52.07]Together we are one.
[297:54.95]Individually, we are weak.
[297:56.07]Together we are strong.
[297:57.77]It's time to do it!
[298:25.09]Attack!
[298:27.29]Their defenses are down!
[298:28.95]Attack!

[300:50.05]Tomorrow, we are going to... I wonder how much longer it will take us to beat Gachi Force.
[300:59.23]We beat this game in an hour or two.
[301:00.99]That's fine.
[301:02.39]We'll do something else.
[301:05.75]And then, of course, I'm going to do Patapon the day after that.
[301:08.01]This game's fun.

[301:35.78]I deleted my save.
[301:40.04]Somebody got a screenshot hopefully eventually.
[301:41.42]Thanks for watching.
[301:43.89]We'll see you tomorrow.

[301:49.89]Goodbye.
[301:50.29]Take care.
[301:50.65]See you later.
[301:53.53]Goon to the bits.
[301:55.56]And the subs.
[301:59.07]start that music why don't we earlier this evening peaceful hayley gave two dollars and fifty cents excited for the green screen stream finally but I do hope you're doing well I'm doing alright I'm doing good
[302:21.53]Like I said before, doing this whole thing where I don't sit down for that long, more than six hours, allows me to stay loose.
[302:30.60]I can move around.
[302:33.00]It's still a problem, but it's probably going to be for a long time until it is actually solved.
[302:42.79]So it's not like, hey, I've got to get this figured out.
[302:45.49]It's going to be gone in a day.
[302:46.53]See you in a day.
[302:47.63]I think I just have to come to terms with the fact that this is going to be a long-term thing that I have to figure out and deal with and treat it and see what happens.
[302:57.78]But it's... I'm feeling better when I'm able to move around.
[303:05.41]I am doing well, though.
[303:07.86]Uh, thank you, Maxtronaut, for the 400 bits.
[303:10.00]Jerma, the virus took both my job, so I can't sub.
[303:14.98]Don't worry about that.
[303:15.88]But here's all my bits.
[303:17.00]You're my favorite streamer, and I'm so excited for another round of laughs.
[303:19.41]Don't worry about subbing to this channel.
[303:27.33]Use that money on you.
[303:32.50]Thank you, though.
[303:35.73]Cream corn.
[303:36.41]Thanks for 250.
[303:37.51]Wow.
[303:38.05]Cream corn 31.
[303:38.89]I can't believe I haven't played Stalker Call of Pripyat before.
[303:42.41]This game is so good.
[303:44.15]Thanks for letting me play it on your couch.
[303:54.39]I'm going to do it on the green screen.
[303:55.67]I'm going to sit there and pretend to play a game like with you.
[304:01.60]I'll give you a bunch of different clips of me on a couch.
[304:03.68]You know, I mean, me sitting on couch, just reacting to things.
[304:08.20]We don't have very many seated reactions.
[304:12.99]They kind of need to be there.
[304:16.23]And I'm just going to pretend to sit.
[304:17.61]I'm going to sit down on a fake chair.
[304:20.15]So you can put me seated wherever you want.
[304:26.23]Officer Narwhal, thanks for the $3.22.
[304:27.15]Jerma, when he plays, got you for us.
[304:46.91]Okay, we'll try this one.
[304:57.74]Is that even gonna work?
[305:06.29]Wait, is it just tiny?
[305:07.13]Is that the problem?
[305:11.07]Oh, it's tiny!
[305:23.90]What is that?
[305:25.08]I don't know.
[305:26.36]That's me playing Gacha Force.
[305:31.51]Why do I have a big dent in my head?
[305:33.53]I don't know.
[305:34.13]I didn't make it.
[305:37.19]Hurlyboy, thanks for the five community subs.
[305:41.44]Don't think I caught that earlier, but thank you.
[305:45.19]Uh-oh.
[305:45.43]That's... Uh-oh.
[306:16.26]Not a strong argument for anything.
[306:20.06]Thanks for the $2.50.
[306:21.96]Saintsauce, thanks for $3.
[306:23.37]Please play Spore someday.
[306:24.87]I will go back to it one day.
[306:26.37]I tried it on stream and it was flashing and it was bugs and it was really, really bad.
[306:34.41]Maybe one day.
[306:37.16]SuperBruce, thanks for the 10 community subs and the $5 here.
[306:40.10]Reasons I watched Jerma985.
[306:41.82]10% gameplay, 90%.
[306:44.06]He's ranting about aliens, brownies, or whether the random shit never changed.
[306:49.86]We had at least 55% gameplay tonight.
[306:56.21]60% gameplay.
[306:56.63]Something like that.
[307:01.89]Thanks for the $5, though.
[307:04.38]Smellyboy, thanks for the $2.50.
[307:05.24]I'm going to report your alien god rant to our atheism, so you better watch out, Buster.
[307:11.95]Subreddit for everything.
[307:14.51]Hey, Freakout, thanks for the $5.00.

[307:21.41]After last time.
[307:32.56]And banned.
[307:33.61]From giving messages on stream.
[307:41.22]End of screen.
[307:41.70]End of stream face cam now.
[307:49.38]Wait, they said I did it.
[307:52.30]Somebody says I did it in all capitals.
[308:02.13]Congratulations.

[309:17.44]You banned from giving me money.
[309:18.60]Alright, we're going to move on.
[309:24.65]Jerm is low key an asshole.
[309:33.42]Um.
[309:34.74]You're one of the people that used one of the porn codes like a month ago, aren't you?
[309:41.61]Okay.
[309:42.79]Just making sure we know.
[309:43.81]Hey, StixRenegade, thanks for $2.50.
[309:56.95]Five grand?
[309:57.57]Reminds me when I spent really roughly four thousand dollars on my multiple furry commissions over the past four years.
[310:04.09]That's not a lot.
[310:04.69]I remember a bidding war on a furry commission that went upwards of three thousand dollars for one art.
[310:12.76]What's a furry commission?
[310:15.12]You pay somebody to make a furry art of you?
[310:17.24]How big is a five thousand dollar picture?
[310:20.62]Is it a mural?
[310:40.95]Furry mural.
[310:43.37]Furry mural.
[310:49.50]Whatever.
[310:50.70]That's a lot of money.
[310:52.54]That's a lot of money.
[310:54.60]Hopefully it was worth it.
[310:55.72]Hopefully you got quality content there.
[310:57.98]I hope so.
[310:59.46]Ajax the Mediocre.
[311:00.62]Thanks for the $15.
[311:01.10]I just watched the public domain VOD earlier.
[311:03.75]I grew up watching the Three Stooges and it was really cool to see it again.
[311:07.57]Love what you do.
[311:11.12]That was a fun night.
[311:12.66]We have to do that again.
[311:23.51]I'm glad you enjoyed it.
[311:25.37]The Three Stooges and the Ritz Brothers.
[311:27.05]We have to watch more Ritz Brothers movies.
[311:30.71]They knocked it out of the park with the gorilla.
[311:33.99]Thanks for the $15.
[311:34.37]Glad you liked it.
[311:40.14]A post thanks to the 500 bits post.
[311:43.60]They say, Holy shit.
[311:44.12]Damn.
[312:14.07]I've never... I've never hallucinated before, but I can imagine that hallucinating is fucking horrible.
[312:28.08]It's just... Something is there.
[312:30.68]Like a person is there.
[312:34.74]But I can't even imagine.
[312:36.98]I can't imagine.
[312:40.51]How do I know I haven't?
[312:41.39]I mean, I guess maybe I don't.
[312:43.58]I don't think I ever have.
[312:50.79]They gave another $5, and they say it continued.
[312:52.49]They say, during yesterday's stream, you read my chat messages like four times.
[312:57.33]And that made me feel so much better.
[312:58.55]That alone.
[313:00.57]I got some sleep.
[313:01.75]I actually got some sleep, which is pretty rare for me nowadays.
[313:04.07]I just wanted to let you know that you have been a massive factor in the maintenance of my mental and emotional health.
[313:08.20]From the bottom of my heart, love you.
[313:14.40]If I can have that kind of effect on somebody, I'm just happy that it... I'm happy that there's something here for you to care about and like and enjoy.
[313:23.65]But I also hope, and I implore you to, if you haven't already, is to try to get a professional involved.
[313:34.93]Try to get yourself on the path to getting better.
[313:41.53]It's a never-ending process.
[313:51.70]But if somebody gets something out of this stream, if you think it's fun, you like to be around here, that's, I'm happy.
[313:57.35]I really am happy that you're around and that you're here to hang out and have fun and laugh and talk shit and enjoy the streams.
[314:05.05]Please, please also take care of yourself.
[314:16.38]Because even if this gives you some, this stream can give you happiness, or even if some people have said this is one of the only things it can, I hope that over the course of the next some odd years of your life, you can find steps to find other things that do make you happy too.
[314:45.56]Trying to get healthy and trying to get yourself on the right path.
[314:49.99]Everyone's trying to do it.
[314:53.57]But I wish you the best.
[314:54.27]I really do.
[315:02.17]Thank you, Post.
[315:04.85]Have a great night.
[315:05.35]Thank you.
[315:05.61]It can be dangerous to put so much stock in one thing for your happiness.
[315:12.79]Yeah, and that's kind of what I mean.
[315:14.27]That's kind of what I mean by that, is... Trying to find other stuff that you know makes you happy.
[315:23.76]It might take a while to find it.
[315:26.26]But it's a lot healthier that way.
[315:35.97]Thank you again.
[315:38.87]Silent Serenity, thanks for 250.
[315:42.35]It should be noted that the UFO declassified videos aren't new and have been circulating on the internet for years.
[315:48.45]Also, it's my understanding that the military has a ton of these recordings and usually they're determined to be things like birds, planes, or balloons upon inspection.
[315:57.62]They tend to look really crazy just because of the flight and camera physics involved.
[316:02.24]The videos were originally leaked by a space conspiracy theory company owned by the guitarist of Blink-182.
[316:11.25]That's a very, very strange last sentence.
[316:17.36]That, uh, it's... Like, okay.
[316:20.34]Alright.
[316:29.57]I haven't seen these videos.
[316:30.83]I... I don't know.
[316:33.27]I... Whatever.
[316:34.23]If there's aliens, there is aliens.
[316:38.21]Look.
[316:39.87]Earth is still here.
[316:44.08]If the aliens, if aliens wanted to like focus a fucking Death Star beam at us... Do you think, do you think they already would have done that by now?
[316:55.81]What's stopping them?
[316:57.11]You know, what's like stopping the aliens from like just Death Starring the planet?
[317:01.27]I... I don't think they want to.
[317:07.53]I don't think they care.
[317:14.41]For now.
[317:16.25]It's just taking a while to get here.
[317:17.51]Wait, you think they fired it already?
[317:21.26]They fired it like 4 million years ago?
[317:23.12]And it's just taking like 6 billion years to get here?
[317:31.55]It's coming.
[317:36.15]They already fired it.
[317:43.56]Yeah, we still got 5.9 billion years left.
[317:47.09]Well, that's not true.
[317:48.75]That's assuming all the trees are here.
[317:53.89]That's assuming grass still grows.
[317:57.85]Not so sure.
[317:58.55]Omega lull 2021.
[318:06.99]Omega lull 2021.
[318:07.59]Why is that so funny?
[318:17.46]Hey, the Boomtown Rats!
[318:19.54]Thanks for the thousand bits.
[318:23.60]Yeah, and we'll do it again.
[318:24.30]I think that was... I loved that.
[318:25.28]Sorry to hear about your breakup.
[318:46.93]Hopefully you feel better about it soon.
[318:48.97]Which you will.
[318:49.39]That's not a bad idea.
[319:16.46]We'll give that a try next time.
[319:22.52]Thanks for the $2.54.
[319:23.18]Yoda985, thanks for... Jeremiah, I'm begging you to listen to this before you do the green screen.
[319:33.81]For the love of God, please shoot stuff from angles that aren't you facing the camera at all times.
[319:37.63]It makes it hard to edit stuff that means... I only have... I don't have like 12 cameras.
[319:54.61]Move the cameras buy more you will Earn I did I did a bunch of stuff from angles Why are you showing us your hearthstone deck I am
[320:23.65]Don't call him Dumas.
[320:26.69]No, don't worry.
[320:27.87]I'll get a shitload of other angles.
[320:31.30]But, I mean, there only is so much I can work with with one guy in the studio.
[320:39.40]We'll see.
[320:40.04]I'll try.
[320:42.20]Where the hell was I?
[320:43.01]Oh, Yoda985.
[320:43.71]Thanks for the $2.69.
[320:45.81]Jeremy, my school just did a Q&A with Will Ferrell over Zoom.
[320:48.95]What?
[320:49.15]What?
[320:50.44]It was cool, but I didn't get to ask him my question, so I'm just gonna pay you like $2 and ask you instead.
[320:56.10]What movie do you enjoy more, Step Brothers or Anchorman?
[321:00.30]I'm a John C. Reilly fan.
[321:01.44]I'd probably have to say Step Brothers.
[321:12.67]How the hell did you have a Q&A with Will Ferrell?
[321:20.99]My school had, like, local gas station employees would come in and teach us stuff and do assemblies.
[321:26.03]Let's get Will Ferrell.
[321:37.42]That's pretty cool.
[321:40.28]That's really cool, actually.
[321:47.89]Celebrities are desperate for attention right now.
[321:52.69]I gotta go around and do a bunch of school Zoom assemblies.
[322:03.31]Well, turn on a live stream.
[322:05.89]Turn on a fucking Twitch stream, Will.
[322:07.95]Come on, Will Ferrell.
[322:08.95]Turn on a stream.
[322:12.07]Load up Gotcha Force.
[322:13.17]Let's see it.
[322:21.62]Oh, I can't believe.
[322:22.86]Oh, what did I just get?
[322:24.60]No, no.
[322:27.72]A rare one?
[322:28.96]No.
[322:29.62]Oh, oh, I'm trying.
[322:30.94]I'm really trying as hard as I can.
[322:34.49]It started okay.
[322:35.63]I'm trying.
[322:40.59]That was like one emotion that he does.
[322:43.57]No, that's one part of a tenth of his personality.
[322:49.35]I kind of nailed it for one second.
[322:54.52]That's it.
[323:00.00]That's Adam Sandler.
[323:02.08]What are the other nine emotions?
[323:03.20]I don't know.
[323:07.94]Why don't you ask him on Zoom at your next school assembly?
[323:11.82]He'll answer it for you.
[323:15.50]Hey, Moss Lion, thanks for the $2.50.
[323:18.61]I think I recall you saying that you and Kim played Animal Crossing off-stream during your move, and then you later implied you weren't into the idea of playing it live anymore.
[323:26.66]That's all well and good, but it'd be fun for everyone to get a tour of your island at some point.
[323:31.30]As an aside point, much love to you and the community.
[323:33.04]You're all a blast.
[323:37.63]Oh, I just have to hook up the switch.
[323:40.61]The switch is not hooked up in here.
[323:45.19]The ship kind of sailed on Animal Crossing for me because of the move.
[323:48.93]That was just what we did.
[323:51.21]Kim and I would just pass it back and forth and play it.
[323:59.26]Maybe.
[324:00.12]Maybe when I get the switch in here we can take a look.
[324:04.41]Peaceful Haley, thanks for the $2.50.
[324:05.38]So I was wondering your opinion on fixed camera angles, like what Resident Evil used to do.
[324:10.94]Do you think they would ever come back?
[324:12.52]I hope not.
[324:13.56]People say it's too risky, but they also said that about over-the-shoulder cameras in Resident Evil, and it worked well.
[324:17.60]I don't know.
[324:17.86]I think seeing a fixed camera game in this day and age would be interesting and refreshing.
[324:21.45]I really hope not.
[324:22.21]I hate them.
[324:24.59]I'm one of those people that makes the five-page Reddit essay about how much I don't like them.
[324:37.39]Hand controls, get rid of them.
[324:38.61]Don't ever have them come back.
[324:39.47]Fixed camera angles.
[324:41.85]They... It's really... There's like a couple scenarios maybe where it'd be interesting.
[324:48.99]But it was just... Oh, no.
[324:59.01]Resident Evil 1 Remake is amazing.
[325:03.19]Yeah, but I like to see.
[325:04.83]Like, I know it's part of it.
[325:07.09]I know, though.
[325:08.27]You can't see what's in front of you.
[325:10.41]I want to see what's in front of me.
[325:14.03]You open up a door and the camera angle's fixed.
[325:16.49]And then you have that problem with fixed camera angles, and they'll never solve this.
[325:19.89]This is the number one reason why I hate it.
[325:22.03]Because the trigger point for the other camera angles is this one line.
[325:27.81]If you cross that line, it changes the camera.
[325:29.83]If you cross back, it goes back to the other camera.
[325:33.89]So you end up having a scenario sometimes where you are trying to run or do something and the... And the camera angle changes like four times in 10 seconds.
[325:43.42]It's unnerving.
[325:49.08]That's the number one reason why I don't like it.
[325:52.75]Now, if it was a truly fixed camera, it would be hard to do that.
[325:57.63]I mean, just only one angle, but yeah, you can't do that.
[325:59.49]I mean, it's impossible.
[326:05.44]And I know that me saying this is like, oh, FPS.
[326:09.28]These fucking Zoomer millennials.
[326:11.49]He wants to shoot things.
[326:13.01]He wants it to be a shooter.
[326:14.25]He wants a third person, first person.
[326:16.05]He wants to shoot things.
[326:17.09]He's a shooter.
[326:20.45]I know.
[326:20.95]I know.
[326:21.35]And look, I get that argument too.
[326:25.63]When both sides are upset with each other, that's how you know that you came to a true compromise.
[326:30.82]Larry David.
[326:32.22]Up, down, left, right.
[326:33.20]There he is.
[326:34.22]That's my guy.
[326:39.08]He's like wait why is he why is he God?
[326:43.44]I just did I did like the father son and I looked up and I Okay Larry centrist Dave no Larry David don't how dare you Larry David is unbelievable and he's I would take a Larry David God I
[327:07.01]If Larry David just came out and was like, you know, I think I'm gone.
[327:12.78]And everyone agreed, I'd be fine with it.
[327:24.09]I mean, this is actually kind of good.
[327:28.79]And the first thing I'm going to do is introduce fixed cameras.
[327:44.53]I was waiting for the reaction for that one because I wasn't, I wasn't feeling that one.
[327:48.55]It's alright though.
[327:51.03]I think some of you might be too tired to do the minus button at this point.
[327:57.28]You were like reaching over like, I'm fucking tired.
[328:00.62]Who cares?
[328:07.42]I've done it.
[328:07.94]I've done it like 200 times today.
[328:10.36]I'll give you this one.
[328:11.90]Punk.
[328:17.37]Hey, remixed place.
[328:18.39]Thanks for the three bucks.
[328:19.39]Jerma, I just got a job at a casino and it's been terrible.
[328:22.54]There's puke everywhere.
[328:23.60]No one cleans the place.
[328:25.32]Our clientele consists of 20 overweight women screaming about buying a new mobile home.
[328:29.90]They don't even buy anything.
[328:31.54]They just come here to scream.
[328:33.26]Every time I ask the manager to do something about it, he throws $20 in my face and goes back to staring at the Italian place across the street.
[328:40.15]He's been watching it for four days without sleep now.
[328:42.19]I'm worried for my safety.
[328:51.09]I liked it.
[328:51.41]Is that a good game?
[328:54.39]Should I give it a try?
[328:55.05]Alright, I'm writing this down.
[328:55.85]Universe Sandbox.
[329:23.51]Didn't I try to play a game like this?
[329:26.21]Dude, this kind of looks fun.
[329:39.47]Holy shit, this looks really fun.
[329:43.74]Cool.
[329:44.34]Alright, I'll play this at some point.
[329:48.48]Let's get the credits on the screen.
[329:56.20]How can the janitor be in two places at the same time?
[329:58.10]He's quick.
[330:00.82]He's really quick.
[330:05.60]Here come the credits, all the subs, community subs, all of you.
[330:09.18]They're about to run by.
[330:10.80]They are.
[330:17.63]I really appreciate it.
[330:18.33]I could say it a thousand times, but it's still true.
[330:25.75]Thank you so much for subscribing to this channel when you just don't have to.
[330:36.45]Thanks.
[330:42.56]We will finish up the vids.
[330:45.94]We had SirCanineGave250.
[330:47.54]Irma is not short.
[330:49.78]He's just impacted by gravity more than most people.
[330:51.92]By understanding that.
[330:53.74]Be understanding, chat.
[330:57.84]That's probably true at some point.
[330:59.45]We'll figure it out.
[331:01.91]Hey New York, thanks for the three dollars.
[331:04.69]Here's what you want to know about light.
[331:06.79]The sun- Thank you.
[331:08.15]Finally, a fucking scientist.
[331:10.21]The sun radiates energy equally in all directions.
[331:13.96]This means that if the Earth were huge, we'd get the same amount of light as long as we were the same distance to the sun.
[331:20.68]Visible light is measured in lumens, which are measured in square feet of coverage.
[331:25.69]no there wouldn't be a tiny spotlight on a huge Earth love the streams fucking quack thanks for the three bucks it's that easy a bunch of science a bunch of science a bunch of knowledge and a bunch of factual information a bunch of science
[331:55.03]What a fucking loser.
[331:57.95]I win!
[332:04.15]Omegalo, not true.
[332:05.47]Sun doesn't distribute energy equally.
[332:16.22]I'm just kidding.
[332:16.76]I hope you know that, right?
[332:19.32]No, that's good to know.
[332:24.66]And thanks for telling everybody that I was right.
[332:32.49]Not true.
[332:33.03]I'm right.
[332:33.45]You're wrong.
[332:35.71]No, I'm right.
[332:36.39]You're wrong.
[332:36.93]You're wrong.
[332:37.39]You're wrong.
[332:37.87]You're wrong.
[332:38.39]You're wrong.
[332:42.33]The sun is not a centrist.
[332:45.58]Yes, it is.
[332:47.28]It's the ultimate centrist, actually.
[332:49.50]It is the number one centrist in the fucking universe.
[332:55.10]It is the definition of the word centrist.
[333:00.51]It's the goddamn center of the fucking Milky Way galaxy and the universe combined.
[333:04.99]The sun is the fucking center of our galaxy.
[333:09.86]Shit, is this right?
[333:24.14]Yes, the sun is in fact... Yes, the sun, in fact, our whole solar system, orbits around the center of the Milky Way galaxy.
[333:35.41]The sun's in the fucking middle.
[333:36.35]You got Jupiter.
[333:39.55]The antlion planet.
[333:41.45]Venus.
[333:43.39]Supercube.
[333:43.97]And then a large... A large jail where all the prisoners are.
[333:59.10]I know my stuff.
[334:00.84]I don't need a scientist or a doctor or anthropologist to tell me these things.
[334:06.82]I know them.
[334:09.67]I can't wait until we can get into that space program and go to the Super Cube.
[334:21.59]Am I an anarchist?
[334:25.08]No, not even close.
[334:26.86]Why?
[334:32.38]You want to know why?
[334:34.11]I would never be close, even near anarchy.
[334:40.41]Who the hell picks up your trash?
[334:49.24]Uh-uh.
[334:53.19]Uh-uh.
[334:54.91]What do I do with it?
[334:55.59]I have to bury it?
[334:58.85]What do I do?
[334:59.37]We have to all fight for the dump?
[335:01.49]Where's the dump?
[335:02.23]Have we decided?
[335:02.89]Do we just choose dumps?
[335:08.00]You would just burn it.
[335:09.46]I wouldn't do that.
[335:10.04]It would be in your house.
[335:12.08]That's what would happen.
[335:12.66]My whole basement would be a dump.
[335:16.14]I'd have to build a house on top of the other house because my basement would be full of trash cans.
[335:19.97]Trash bags.
[335:20.53]Trash bags.
[335:25.29]We shouldn't have single-use waste anyways.
[335:27.27]Grow organic food, Dumas.
[335:32.49]The name is Dumbass.
[335:46.00]Nobody tell him where the trash goes during anarchy.
[335:52.69]Well, judging from every video game I've ever played about the subject, it goes all over the street.
[335:59.10]And all over people's yards.
[336:01.56]And all over everything.
[336:12.69]Like, what game's The Last of Us?
[336:14.51]I win.
[336:28.26]In my yard?
[336:32.31]Alright, moving on.
[336:34.31]Wow.
[336:34.47]Holy shit, that's a great idea.
[336:35.65]I'm stealing that from you.
[336:36.31]Slygarf, thanks for the great idea when I- when I want to take a few days off.
[336:39.19]Your dream's gonna become a reality at some point in the future.
[336:57.78]Kerbumble, thanks for the $5.
[336:59.00]Thanks for sticking with this game, even though chat's being bizarrely negative about it.
[337:03.42]Since you'll definitely finish this tomorrow, I want to say you should take a look at the undersides of some of your blockier machine borgs, like G-Red.
[337:11.64]It's a very small but cute detail on some of them.
[337:15.03]Also, you might want to try ChosujumechaMG.
[337:20.93]It's like Gacha Force with giant robots made by the EDF devs and got a fan translation last year.
[337:26.25]Hmm.
[337:29.97]For your first comment, are you telling me to turn all them upside down and look under the... Yes, okay.
[337:45.06]And then that other one, is that a good game?
[337:47.24]Put it on the list.
[337:48.56]Make sure you guys put these in the recommended channel.
[337:51.10]I skim through that and I pull tons of stuff from there every month or two.
[337:55.11]Really, it's where half of these games even came from in the first place.
[338:03.09]But thanks for the $5, Kurt Bumble, and we'll check it out tomorrow.
[338:07.95]News and Coffin, thanks for $2.50.
[338:09.07]I said it before and I'll say it again.
[338:10.81]I don't understand what's going on here.
[338:12.87]Anyway, it's just me again.
[338:14.14]I want to say thanks for showing this super cool game and blah blah.
[338:17.06]Okay, whatever, that's it.
[338:18.08]I'm honestly sick and tired of this guy.
[338:19.98]No, this is not the message.
[338:20.86]This is real.
[338:21.70]I don't care how much money you give me.
[338:23.08]I won't play God Hand ever.
[338:24.42]Now get lost.
[338:25.25]You're banned.
[338:35.30]Let's do it.
[338:37.82]Get lost.
[338:40.34]Why would you say that?
[338:41.02]I'm not going to play God Hand.
[338:42.90]I'm sick of it.
[338:44.42]Sick of hearing about it.
[338:48.82]I'll probably play that in a few weeks.
[338:51.64]Hey, Drosophila, thanks for $2.50.
[338:54.77]Basically, your big Earth theory needs to be upgraded to a humongous Earth theory.
[338:58.81]Sincerely, a huge space nerd.
[339:02.66]Wait, hold on.
[339:03.52]This is important.
[339:05.20]This is really important.
[339:06.26]This is another scientist here.
[339:08.42]Let's take a look at this.
[339:14.72]This is a big ass... Days are defined by the Earth's rotation.
[339:25.81]Yeah.
[339:27.65]That's what I said.
[339:30.20]half of Earth is illuminated by the sun while the other half is in its shadow right the sun is a giant sphere beaming light in all directions okay sure the Earth is a hundred million miles away from the sun fun fact an Earth that's a hundred times the diameter is approximately the size of the sun what I thought the sun was just a really bright gumdrop
[339:57.49]It's that big?
[339:58.15]I thought it was, like, as big as a fucking, like, Chevy Malibu.
[340:04.06]Fucking... I'm kidding.
[340:05.88]Holy shit.
[340:10.54]Uh, fun fact, an Earth that's 100 times the diameter is approximately the size of... Yeah.
[340:15.46]Okay.
[340:22.18]in both cases the sun shines on half of the sphere that is the Earth right the only way that the spotlight effect could take place or there could be a substantial difference between night and day is if the sun was a point light extremely close to the Earth or if the Earth was thousands of times bigger than the sun but what would happen
[340:53.34]That.
[340:53.90]Oh.
[340:57.15]We tried to tell you.
[340:59.37]Look, it's a thought project.
[341:02.67]Thanks to the 250, and that's cool.
[341:05.91]I'm glad people are figuring this stuff out.
[341:07.61]I could be your teacher.
[341:12.84]I will see you tomorrow.
[341:15.78]Thanks for watching.
[341:17.12]We still have a few more bits to do, but I want to say my goodnights to you.
[341:21.47]Goodbye.
[341:24.11]We have four or five more bits or so.
[341:29.91]Ajax the Mediocre, thanks for $15.
[341:31.37]Did it just say yeet?
[341:33.96]That's a $15 yeet right there.
[341:36.08]Thank you.
[341:38.12]Shrimp Named Slickback, thanks for the $15.
[341:42.14]1500 bits.
[341:46.31]Jeremy, I just figured I'd give you some money and let you know that you've been a bright ray of color for this otherwise dull life.
[341:53.03]Especially since I've been working at the local grocery store the past few weeks, I figured I'd get this out before it's too late.
[341:58.09]P.S.
[341:58.35]If you're ever thinking about playing the prototype biohazard bundle, it's on sale for $12 until tomorrow.
[342:03.37]I think it'd be right up your alley.
[342:06.61]Much love.
[342:06.95]Thanks for everything.
[342:11.56]Yeah, I...
[342:14.11]I own... I think I own a couple of them.
[342:16.68]I think I already own them.
[342:18.82]It was a problem with streaming them.
[342:20.58]Because I own Prototype 1 and Prototype 2.
[342:25.36]I had a bunch of OBS problems.
[342:26.70]The game couldn't be captured right.
[342:28.24]It was all messed up.
[342:28.96]It was glitchy.
[342:29.49]It was laggy.
[342:31.25]I was thinking about just getting them for Xbox 360.
[342:34.17]And just dealing with the Xbox.
[342:41.57]Please ban Spammer.
[342:42.56]Wait, what?
[342:47.37]Oh, somebody got it.
[342:53.70]Was somebody spamming?
[342:56.14]Oh.
[342:59.36]Well, don't spam.
[343:00.76]Come on, man.
[343:01.34]What are you spamming for?
[343:09.55]Anyways, where were we?
[343:10.93]Yeah, I own prototype one and prototype two.
[343:19.43]Probably get them on Xbox, though.
[343:21.03]Just to make sure they work.
[343:23.25]Or look into some mods or patches for the game on PC.
[343:29.27]Thanks for the $15.
[343:31.51]Edmund Hakari, thanks for $5.
[343:33.35]Thanks for your streams, Jerma.
[343:34.37]I had my car stolen on the 20th.
[343:35.73]That sucks.
[343:37.60]Between that, moving, and trying to get a job with everything going on, it's been a real stressful time.
[343:43.42]You've made it easier and have made me feel a lot better.
[343:45.96]Good job with the peasant army at the end.
[343:47.70]It was fun.
[343:54.44]It's always something so horrible when you hear about that kind of stuff.
[343:59.69]It's just, you feel so awful.
[344:03.63]Because, you know, when somebody takes something from you, whether it's something you've owned for a long time or something that's expensive, it just...
[344:13.96]Thankfully, I've never had anything really major taken from me.
[344:18.68]But man, is it scary to think about that.
[344:20.82]I'm really sorry that happened.
[344:22.28]That sucks.
[344:23.54]Hopefully, you can either get it back or your insurance can help you take care of that.
[344:27.74]The police, obviously.
[344:28.69]I'm sure probably are already involved.
[344:32.93]That's really, really... I'm sorry to hear that.
[344:36.91]Hopefully, you get that figured out.
[344:48.41]Thanks to the five dolls.
[344:49.66]I wish you luck.
[344:52.80]Wembley TTV, thanks for 250.
[344:54.16]I've been randomly following your Redbubble shop.
[344:58.84]I can now buy Jerma Eats a Shoe socks for $58, which is $72 USD, or get a bootleg Redbubble design of an illegal quad movie stream sticker.
[345:10.83]It's a screenshot of that other Jerma stream during that bug game.
[345:15.75]Still nothing tops the $307 golden mug with your face on it.
[345:27.59]Do not, under any circumstance, pay somebody $300 for a fucking spray-painted mug with a JPEG printed on it.
[345:37.49]With like a label-making program.
[345:46.16]No, I'm just telling you that I have nothing to do with that, and you're going to be severely disappointed when you get it in the mail.
[345:57.30]That's what the stimulus check is for.
[346:05.07]Do not spend your stimulus check on a golden fucking mug of... It's not even me.
[346:15.19]I don't even know who that person is.
[346:22.71]Anyways, be careful.
[346:23.64]And none of that stuff is... I don't have nothing to do with it.
[346:26.54]I don't have one of those.
[346:28.52]I have two t-shirts on Teespring.
[346:31.30]And maybe soon to be another one.
[346:33.42]In like a year.
[346:34.68]That gives me enough time to make sure that within the next year some other stuff gets up there.
[346:39.30]Thanks for the $2.50.
[346:39.62]Slots and lanes.
[346:42.28]Of course.
[346:42.64]Slots and lanes.
[346:57.81]Please make enamel pins of your emotes, please.
[347:00.29]I don't know why I thought for some reason you're talking about tooth enamel.
[347:03.81]And you wanted to put them on your teeth.
[347:14.00]We are.
[347:14.32]I don't... Maybe you are.
[347:19.70]Peaceful Haley, thanks for 250.
[347:20.88]I'm rolling my eyes right now.
[347:22.04]You zoomer millennial Redditor Keanu Reeves big chungus streamer.
[347:26.98]Big Chungus makes me laugh.
[347:28.96]It does.
[347:30.72]Even if it's a fake story, I just imagine somebody coming in to a store, like a GameStop, and asking for the game Big Chungus for PS4 or whatever.
[347:43.65]And it's like the Bugs Bunny picture.
[347:50.21]He wanted Big Chungus.
[347:52.85]That makes me laugh.
[347:53.97]Forget about... Okay, that makes me chuckle.
[347:56.27]And then I don't think about it anymore.
[348:03.24]Redditor, Redditor.
[348:04.28]He's a... What... Okay, what other, like... Can I ask a question?
[348:08.18]What other Harry Potter schools of, like, online communities can you be in?
[348:13.31]I don't understand this.
[348:19.47]Redditor.
[348:19.83]Redditor.
[348:22.14]4channer, Tumblr, TikTok.
[348:32.07]Which one of them is... Okay, which one of them... Well, that 4chan is Slytherin.
[348:35.35]That's easy.
[348:36.59]Which one of them is Gryffindor?
[348:40.43]Reddit.
[348:45.54]Hufflepuff is YouTube, without a doubt.
[348:51.74]That's easy too.
[348:56.58]Reddit to Gryffindor.
[348:57.36]Yeah.
[349:00.91]TikTok is Ravenclaw.
[349:05.37]No.
[349:05.61]TikTok is Ravenclaw.
[349:08.21]TikTok is Hufflepuff.
[349:11.11]And YouTube is Ravenclaw.
[349:18.49]And Tumblr are the people that look into the school from outside the window.
[349:44.86]What about Facebook?
[349:45.62]Facebook is just like one of the computers in one of the libraries.
[349:49.44]That's all it is.
[350:07.49]What is Twitch?
[350:09.89]Oh.
[350:15.86]Shit, hold on.
[350:16.76]Do I have this wrong?
[350:19.90]No, Twitch is... Like, we need the Death Eaters, right?
[350:27.22]I don't think Twitch... Twitch might think they're the Death Eaters and the Voldemorts.
[350:32.29]No, they're not.
[350:33.43]Twitch is Hufflepuff.
[350:34.37]Let me get this right.
[350:36.17]YouTube is Ravenclaw.
[350:45.75]Poor chance of Death Eaters.
[350:47.25]No, I disagree.
[350:48.97]I disagree.
[351:00.17]The only fans are Death Eaters.
[351:02.38]Oh my god.
[351:19.35]Okay, let's go.
[351:23.37]That's pretty much it.
[351:24.73]Oh, we have one, two more.
[351:26.97]Stix Renegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[351:28.35]Since you're apparently going to play any game chat's throwing at you today, can I expect Jackie Chan Stuntmaster within the next 10 years?
[351:34.29]Yeah, you probably can.
[351:35.98]Yeah?
[351:36.90]Yes.
[351:39.96]And finally, Rip Alex Trebek, thanks for the $5.00.
[351:44.88]Hey Jeremy nice stream bro.
[351:46.13]I looked into the taxes thing and I've decided not to do them I don't I already pay taxes when I buy shit from the store.
[351:51.63]I hope I don't get in trouble Well you see See there are there are multiple different taxes
[352:07.24]There are sales tax.
[352:08.96]Sales tax exists, and that's on consumer goods.
[352:12.18]There's income tax.
[352:14.22]There's state income tax, depending on if you're in the United States.
[352:18.47]There's capital gains tax, if you have investments.
[352:23.09]There's quite a few of them, actually.
[352:26.03]No, when you buy the Nintendo Switch at the GameStop, you're not paying your year's worth of taxes.
[352:35.66]Just want to make sure you're clear on that.
[352:44.54]Yes, you are.
[352:51.96]There are only few things certain in life.
[352:54.37]Death and taxes.
[352:58.45]Ah, that word makes me angry.
[353:08.34]Death and a Jerm of delay.
[353:15.04]And shitting your pants.
[353:16.16]What?
[353:22.99]Taxes.
[353:23.97]Yes, pay your taxes.
[353:24.81]Pay your taxes.
[353:25.19]Look.
[353:26.61]Everybody fucking hates paying taxes.
[353:29.01]There's nobody.
[353:29.71]I don't.
[353:29.97]There's no one.
[353:31.43]I'm sorry.
[353:31.89]I have to say this.
[353:33.01]There is nobody that puts their check in the mail to the IRS and goes, I take it.
[353:39.99]I love it.
[353:41.37]Oh, goodbye money.
[353:43.16]I love when you take it.
[353:44.74]Please take it.
[353:45.84]Nobody.
[353:46.34]Nobody says that.
[353:47.70]Nobody.
[353:48.06]But it's a necessary thing that we all have to do.
[353:50.76]Nobody wants to do it and nobody's happy about it.
[353:54.28]But you gotta... Wait a minute.
[353:55.82]I got 100 fucking subs.
[354:04.20]Why Mohg at the very end of the stream just dropped 100 subs?
[354:07.86]Of 1-0-0.
[354:11.62]Doing a tax rant during a sub bomb.
[354:18.26]That's a lot.
[354:19.48]That's a huge amount of subs.
[354:23.01]That's $500 that YMOG just paid.
[354:31.30]God damn.
[354:36.74]Thank you for that.
[354:37.40]Completely unnecessary, but I'll take it.
[354:41.20]Thanks for giving 100 people subs.
[354:43.52]And then another one.
[354:45.02]Silverjack just gave 5.
[354:49.33]Thanks to both of you.
[354:52.40]That was the stimulus check.
[354:58.94]Long story short, pay your taxes.
[355:01.24]Make sure you're paying your taxes.
[355:02.44]If you owe, and make sure if you need to get some advice from... Not from me.
[355:08.56]Because I get advice from somebody else.
[355:10.14]I have a CPA.
[355:11.44]I have an accountant that helps me.
[355:12.94]So don't take advice from me because I'm stupid.
[355:15.86]Find somebody that knows what they're talking about.

[356:17.14]The after credits scene is just another credits.
[356:20.36]That's painfully boring.
[356:30.60]Backwards.
[356:33.85]Remember when I used to read them?
[356:35.38]Yeah, I do.

[359:25.72]I would do it.
[359:26.84]But don't do that.
