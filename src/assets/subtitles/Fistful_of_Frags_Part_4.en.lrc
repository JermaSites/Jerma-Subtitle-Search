[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.95]Why can nobody see me?
[00:12.30]Hello?
[00:23.05]Can anybody hear me?
[00:30.69]I can see you now.
[00:31.37]Okay, so we are live, okay.
[00:39.37]Let's restart this then.
[00:43.35]Yeah, I've been live for like, at least two or three minutes.
[00:49.86]And it just barely went through, that's interesting.
[00:55.20]Interesting.
[00:58.65]But good evening.
[01:00.63]Hope you guys are having a good day.
[01:02.95]Good afternoon or night.
[01:05.43]Whatever time it is where you are.
[01:12.11]I'll be your host for the next few hours.
[01:15.35]However long I decide to stream, you know.
[01:19.16]You can call me... You can call me... J-Man.
[01:23.38]That's what I like to be called.
[01:24.60]J-Man.
[01:29.01]Ugh.
[01:32.67]Invisible streamer.
[01:34.47]Hold on for 25 minutes.
[01:35.73]I need to make waffles.
[01:37.05]How am I feeling?
[01:42.94]I feel okay.
[01:43.80]I feel a little... a little weird at the moment.
[01:48.40]I have that, like... You have a stomachache, but you don't quite have a stomachache, and it's just to a point where your back hurts.
[01:55.58]Stomachache.
[01:56.04]Does that make any sense?
[02:00.23]I have a stomach ache, but my back hurts.
[02:04.43]You know what I mean?
[02:07.96]It's weird.
[02:08.84]We're gonna play Fistful of Frags.
[02:11.48]Just to chill for a little bit.
[02:17.44]I have some plans for this coming week's streams.
[02:20.91]Specifically on Friday.
[02:22.59]Friday should be fun.
[02:26.49]Hey, my fly is down.
[02:30.66]Well, that's impossible because I don't have any pants on.
[02:39.42]Sharp streamer, never late.
[02:43.42]Thank you, Buzzkit.
[02:45.84]Thank you so much for the 15 bucks.
[02:50.08]Is it going to be a 2012 Jerma stream?
[02:53.27]I don't know.
[02:57.31]I don't know.
[02:58.57]We'll see.
[03:01.79]But this is going to be a... Wait, what is this thing?
[03:09.34]I have no idea what Twitch is telling me right now.
[03:12.02]Twitch is giving me all kinds of info that I've never seen before.
[03:19.56]What's it like being 6'4"?
[03:21.38]It's pretty cool.
[03:24.80]Yeah, nothing too intense tonight.
[03:26.34]Like, I said, I've got this weird back stomach ache.
[03:30.38]It makes it so when I make a loud noise, like, I think I'm just getting old.
[03:36.77]Am I getting old?
[03:37.97]What do you guys think?
[03:40.87]This shit happened to me before, too.
[03:42.01]Remember when, like, my back was killing me and I had, like, my kidneys fucking hurt, you know what I mean?
[03:47.21]Weird.
[03:49.36]But, let's hop into some Fistful of Frags.
[03:53.97]Just gonna chill and play.
[03:58.73]Can I make the stream orbit a wallpaper?
[04:04.54]Maybe, yeah.
[04:05.20]Let me talk to Blordow.
[04:07.52]And see if he could just kind of get a good screenshot.
[04:09.80]A high quality one.
[04:10.44]See if he would do that.
[04:14.36]Let's go here.
[04:22.32]This is a lot of people on this map.
[04:23.94]Holy shit, there's 27 people on this map.
[04:25.92]I don't think I want to play on that one.
[04:28.00]Here we go.
[04:34.72]This one looks good.
[04:39.92]Did that work?
[04:44.59]Of course not.
[04:49.02]Of course it didn't work.
[04:50.06]Why would it have worked?
[04:51.14]OBS has not been able to game capture a game in like three weeks.
[04:55.12]Oh my god, it actually just worked right now.
[04:58.52]Okay.
[04:59.54]I stand corrected.
[05:01.60]I stand corrected, guys.
[05:03.11]We're good.
[05:06.73]Is this live or a rerun?
[05:07.59]This is live, my man.
[05:08.65]This is live, my friend.
[05:09.29]We are live.
[05:19.50]I need to change that to Cowboy Chilly, don't I?
[05:21.74]Not Cowboy Chill, fuck.
[05:24.96]Oh well.
[05:27.40]Yeah, we're just gonna play.
[05:28.64]Gonna hang out.
[05:30.94]Nothing too intense, you know what I mean?
[05:32.40]We're just gonna chill, have fun.
[05:35.34]Do you have Fistful of Frags?
[05:37.58]Everybody has Fistful of Frags, because Fistful of Frags is a free video game.
[05:42.80]It is completely and totally for free.
[05:45.05]You just have to have Steam.
[05:48.29]And, you know, good conscience.
[05:50.39]I don't know why I'm using this gun.
[05:55.33]I need to change this out immediately.
[05:56.50]I hate this thing.
[06:03.58]Fake streamer.
[06:06.20]Should we get some more gaming product?
[06:07.34]Yeah, maybe later.
[06:08.16]Maybe I'll talk about my new monitor later.
[06:10.66]You know what I mean?
[06:14.53]This is not the gun I should be using.
[06:15.63]And I'll just die.
[06:16.21]Somebody just kill me so I can put on a different weapon.
[06:18.19]I hate this thing.
[06:33.62]I have no arms.
[06:34.27]Do I still have this game?
[06:36.91]You should.
[06:39.05]Oh, that just... You just gave me a Christmas dinner right here, man.
[06:44.76]We're talking all the trimmings.
[06:45.72]We're talking, you know, even the gizzard.
[06:47.10]I'd eat the fucking gizzard for this.
[06:48.56]You know what I mean?
[06:52.58]For this pump-action shotgun, fry up the gizzard.
[06:57.00]Because I'll eat it.
[06:58.39]And that shit, you throw that shit in the trash.
[07:07.77]Razor death at her.
[07:13.33]Nope.
[07:17.59]Whiskey, come on.
[07:18.58]Give me the full health.
[07:24.06]Give it a maximum HP.
[07:27.16]Hey.
[07:29.84]Come on in this door.
[07:32.13]Follow me in here.
[07:33.63]Oh, fine.
[07:36.01]Oh!
[07:37.05]Come on.
[07:37.57]I didn't even... Oh, man.
[07:39.51]Follow your nose, Toucan Sam.
[07:40.99]Well, that sucked.
[07:47.01]I just got a little unlucky there.
[07:51.42]Here comes the dynamite.
[07:52.50]There goes my weapon.
[08:00.64]What?
[08:01.65]Were there mines on the stairs?
[08:04.73]What the hell was that?
[08:07.21]I just stepped on booby-trapped stairs.
[08:14.68]In the name of God, is ha- Pay gamers.
[08:20.86]Yeah, we'll talk about my monitor later on.
[08:23.50]In like a little bit.
[08:25.40]I have to do my paid promotion at exactly- Hold on, let me just get killed by this guy.
[08:31.83]Really quickly.
[08:34.09]Well, I got him.
[08:35.79]Yeah, my paid promotion has to happen at exactly 7.22.
[08:45.66]722.
[08:47.52]Is when the contract says I have to... I have to do it.
[08:58.35]As all his friends came over.
[08:59.49]Are we taking control of this room?
[09:15.24]Sellout stream.
[09:19.65]How do I not kill that guy?
[09:27.95]No.
[09:28.21]722.
[09:28.23]I had no idea where I was.
[09:38.09]That guy was just me.
[09:40.17]I went into a wormhole and I was the guy that was killing me before.
[09:43.03]That's what I looked like.
[09:52.09]Alright, uh, no... There's no way that just happened.
[09:56.85]There's no way.
[10:00.04]I literally got, like, turned instakilled.
[10:04.64]No fucking way.
[10:05.46]I don't believe that for a second.
[10:08.32]Check, hey, check that guy's files!
[10:09.96]You know what I mean?
[10:15.05]Open up that guy's files.
[10:17.21]I wanna see him.
[10:29.40]Two and a half Jupiters.
[10:32.00]Wait, there was two Jupiters?
[10:35.94]God damn it.
[10:38.43]Like, not this shit.
[10:40.89]Like, what even happened?
[10:44.66]My character just keeps like jumping on a trampoline.
[10:57.07]Who's giving me the, like, the flubber shoes?
[10:59.31]It's bullshit.
[11:03.75]Nope.
[11:20.20]I gotta do that more often.
[11:21.12]Is that a golf club?
[11:22.88]No, it's a gun.
[11:27.73]I got it right in his elbow.
[11:28.71]Dude, you should be able to like... Check that guy's fucking connection.
[11:36.58]Yeah, that guy's definitely using one of those programs that like... Makes it so your internet goes slower and then faster really quickly so then you get the extra rubberbanding speed.
[11:45.92]Check that guy's connection.
[11:55.17]Fan the Hammer in 2017.
[11:56.71]Is that not effective anymore?
[11:57.70]I haven't played Overwatch, guys, in like... A long time.
[12:02.94]Is McCree still good?
[12:08.82]Is McCree a good character still?
[12:10.22]Or how do you play with him now?
[12:15.38]Shit.
[12:17.36]Lag switch.
[12:18.04]That's what I was... Yeah, a lag switch.
[12:19.50]That's what I thought it was.
[12:21.18]Didn't even know that guy was behind me.
[12:27.44]He's using a broken weapon.
[12:33.48]I've warmed up a little bit here.
[12:34.72]Can I get some spring stuff together?
[12:39.02]Me and this guy will never kill each other, so I'm going in here.
[12:43.81]Box is here.
[12:45.03]Three box.
[12:47.85]This time... Why does everybody take the shotgun?
[12:50.43]You gotta take the walker, man.
[12:52.31]Don't take the shotgun.
[12:56.14]That guy just fell out of the skylight.
[13:00.08]See you later.
[13:00.74]Alright.
[13:02.11]You take the walker.
[13:02.93]Alright, so that first shot, I would like somebody to explain to me how I didn't hit him.
[13:19.48]Apparently I gotta deal with this guy's lag switch again.
[13:27.37]Oh, come on, that was going to be mine.
[13:32.82]Yeah, the walker is ridiculous.
[13:38.88]Like, why would you never... Don't ever take this out.
[13:42.56]The shotgun is such a piece of shit in comparison.
[13:47.01]The shotgun's not a guaranteed kill.
[13:50.31]You have to aim a little worse with the shotgun, but man, this thing is a 100% golden gun from 007 N64.
[14:01.76]Who wouldn't use this?
[14:06.92]I got a second, I'm going back up top.
[14:11.34]Let's get this thing loaded again.
[14:12.80]Wait, what?
[14:15.36]Shotgun reloads, but yeah, that's true, but in a situation where...
[14:19.44]It's kind of hard to stay alive in this game for more than like a couple minutes anyways.
[14:24.38]Why not just take the sure thing?
[14:26.76]Itchy nose.
[14:32.59]Shit, that guy's got a rifle.
[14:34.05]I'm going, I'm wrapping around.
[14:35.47]Damn it.
[14:43.65]Wow, did you see that guy's jump?
[14:46.45]Did you see that guy's matrix jump?
[14:50.47]That motherfucker was just doing some NEO shit, alright?
[14:53.80]Check that guy's fucking connection files.
[14:57.68]That dude jumped around the bullet.
[15:01.12]Are you shitting me, dude?
[15:02.77]Somebody rewind that and fucking slow it down.
[15:06.31]That dude knew where that bullet was gonna be.
[15:19.95]You know how Quicksilver can play those old meme songs and jump around and grab people and make police officers punch themselves in the face?
[15:29.09]That's what just happened.
[15:30.55]I just got punched in the face by myself by Quicksilver.
[15:34.92]And they played that Marilyn Manson song.
[15:37.60]That just happened to me.
[15:39.48]I'm going to be part of a fucking Pixar movie now.
[15:41.60]Who made that movie?
[15:42.46]Walter?
[15:43.34]Walt Disney?
[15:44.00]No.
[15:45.04]Warner Brothers.
[15:45.82]Warner Disney.
[15:47.30]Walter Warner Disney.
[15:54.53]What am I doing up here?
[15:57.43]Days of Future Fragged.
[16:01.57]God, I'm gonna die.
[16:05.14]I knew it, I told you.
[16:17.00]Walker.
[16:23.34]Where's my gun?
[16:24.74]I don't like how the gun just disappears.
[16:26.50]Come on.
[16:27.56]Come on, EA.
[16:28.48]No, I'm not doing that joke again.
[16:29.68]We're done.
[16:30.74]I'm not going to stop making up like... I have a weapon.
[16:35.38]Well, now I do.
[16:42.32]You always use the left-handed specialist.
[16:54.67]Load a bag up.
[16:56.33]I got one clipped.
[17:01.21]I just, like, got fucking stuck behind that guy.
[17:06.94]Now we're all gonna die.
[17:07.78]He's not dead!
[17:13.44]Oh, that guy has one hit.
[17:15.91]Hit that guy with anything.
[17:16.69]Why are we all stuffed in here?
[17:17.55]Someone's gonna throw a grenade in here and we're all gonna die.
[17:24.62]That's just dangerous.
[17:25.38]I need to move.
[17:27.98]I'm just surrounded.
[17:31.03]Ant Hill is going to get just fucked up right now.
[17:36.69]I need to... My hand is locking up on me.
[17:39.33]Stop locking up hand.
[17:40.21]It gets cold in this room.
[17:50.38]I need a gamer glove.
[17:57.58]Damn it.
[18:01.52]Triple Jupiter?
[18:03.96]How are you guys pulling these off?
[18:11.79]Anybody else get like that?
[18:15.93]Any other old men in the chat?
[18:18.14]Let me know.
[18:21.45]All you old ass men in the chat, do your hands just get really cold when you're playing a video game?
[18:25.85]Like with a mouse?
[18:27.19]Sometimes my fingers and hands just turn to stone.
[18:36.42]Wait, what?
[18:39.60]Fuck it, I'm just gonna sit here.
[18:41.56]Open it.
[18:43.84]No one's coming in the bank, might as well use it, right?
[18:46.42]Wait, what?
[18:48.02]I'm coming back to the walker.
[18:48.88]If you're gonna give me the walker, I'm taking it every time, man.
[18:51.78]I'll take this thing every single time.
[18:53.34]And be happy.
[18:56.20]Yeah.
[18:58.26]Shit.
[19:00.68]Good.
[19:03.29]Any other friends up here that I need to be concerned with?
[19:11.41]He has a shotgun.
[19:12.17]Somebody get that.
[19:13.23]Somebody get this done.
[19:15.22]Nice.
[19:15.60]Good job.
[19:19.50]What the fuck, man?
[19:20.90]This is stupid trampoline bullshit.
[19:28.95]Hold on.
[19:34.25]Just let me... One second.
[19:35.45]Alright.
[19:45.19]We're good.
[19:53.74]Hey.
[19:54.82]Don't you think about doing that.
[19:56.46]You know, you can think about doing it, but don't do it.
[20:05.59]Come on.
[20:10.73]Ah, I wanted the last hit.
[20:11.83]Did I die?
[20:13.75]What did it just give me?
[20:14.68]What is that?
[20:15.00]Did it just give me a skull field?
[20:18.96]Thanks, dude.
[20:19.36]Aww.
[20:20.36]Aww.
[20:22.13]Oh, well.
[20:24.35]Turn off the trampoline in the options menu.
[20:25.99]I don't want to deal with any more trampolines.
[20:41.01]His back was even turned to me.
[20:43.05]Seriously, I'm about to stick my hand
[20:51.27]Into a jar of fucking mayonnaise.
[20:53.33]After putting it in the microwave.
[20:54.51]And just keep it in there.
[21:01.33]Stone man right now.
[21:05.05]It's annoying being stone man.
[21:13.72]Oh my god.
[21:16.52]I just...
[21:21.26]Put it in the furnace.
[21:22.06]I'm about to just turn my stove on and just hold my fucking hand over the flames.
[21:26.10]I feel like a pitcher on the mound.
[21:34.23]I just wish I could see a little better, you know what I mean?
[21:42.91]Sometimes I wish I could see the game a little better, you know what I mean?
[21:46.94]It's tough.
[21:49.78]Like, I really don't know what I should do in regards to that.
[21:52.88]If I was, like, somebody that was playing a game.
[21:54.52]If I was, like, a gamer or something.
[22:00.75]I'm not sure.
[22:05.83]But, you know, sometimes... Hold on, let me get rid of this guy.
[22:08.52]Okay.
[22:13.32]Let's get rid of this guy real quick and... You know, I actually saw that guy real well.
[22:19.44]Saw that guy real well.
[22:22.02]Hey gamers!
[22:24.83]Do you know what Jerma985 uses for his monitor?
[22:28.35]He uses... An NVIDIA G-SYNC!
[22:31.61]192500!
[22:32.43]Get shots like this!
[22:34.44]Get shots like this one!
[22:46.37]Only with the NVIDIA 144Hz G-SYNC!
[22:50.77]Power to the players!
[22:56.34]And by the way, if you use the code... G-SYNC!
[23:02.24]You'll get shots like that!
[23:04.86]Take a look at that, the game-ending kill cam!
[23:13.58]Now we're going to go to the next map.
[23:16.90]Nice $12 jump.
[23:50.14]Game ending kill sponsored by NVIDIA.
[23:53.68]Power to the players.
[24:04.14]He has to use guns to get kills.
[24:05.82]Oh, I'm out of bullets.
[24:08.18]What?
[24:09.00]Look what I got him.
[24:12.79]I just got hit.
[24:13.43]What the hell was that?
[24:15.43]That was my, that was my, uh, my sponsorship.
[24:28.07]Now let's play.
[24:29.89]No, don't throw that at me.
[24:35.35]Straighten your hand a little bit more.
[24:43.18]Why am I left-handed?
[24:43.84]Because left-handed is more accurate.
[24:46.44]Right-handed.
[24:50.18]But left-handed does not do fan the hammer kills as well.
[24:55.02]Ran right by me and I shot him right in the head.
[24:57.80]Okay.
[24:58.16]Well, we have a string going now.
[25:00.14]Let's keep it going.
[25:03.72]Oh, goddammit.
[25:04.44]Like, right when I'm reloading, too.
[25:05.88]Thank god.
[25:06.44]Thank you for saving my life.
[25:08.11]You are fantastic.
[25:10.15]Thank you, Scott.
[25:11.35]713.
[25:11.39]Turn with the power, gamer.
[25:22.79]What?
[25:28.09]What was that monitor called again?
[25:29.33]I don't know.
[25:31.91]Didn't NVIDIA make something like that?
[25:33.59]Yeah.
[25:37.27]Something like that.
[25:37.95]Something along those lines.
[25:45.74]Come on.
[25:46.44]Really?
[25:51.66]I'm third.
[25:52.52]I'm doing number one on our team.
[25:55.59]I didn't want to do that though.
[26:04.98]Oh, fuck.
[26:05.56]Don't get us bolted.
[26:06.52]We have bolters for rebuilding our weapons.
[26:09.02]At least I killed him.
[26:12.07]This used to be a Kevin stream.
[26:13.33]Alright, can somebody in the chat explain to me what the Kevin joke is?
[26:17.19]I don't know.
[26:25.74]After I die, some bits came in.
[26:27.84]I'm going to read them.
[26:37.27]Whoa.
[26:37.89]See, that's why the shotgun sucks.
[26:41.71]And that's why the fucking dynamite is stupid.
[26:45.77]Fucking the dynamite, man.
[26:50.73]How many deaths have I had to dynamite?
[26:52.65]And how many deaths have I had to guns?
[26:55.40]I would assume it's like 50-50 at this stage right now.
[27:04.56]I don't know who Kevin is.
[27:06.48]I know a Kevin in real life.
[27:10.82]I know a Kevin.
[27:15.97]This guy's gonna kill me.
[27:16.89]No, he's not.
[27:17.59]Apparently, I'm gonna get him.
[27:22.89]It's from SpongeBob.
[27:25.43]No?
[27:25.75]Okay.
[27:30.05]Give me your gun.
[27:31.97]Why did you have to have the Derringer?
[27:34.69]All the weapons you could have had.
[27:36.01]You have to have this one.
[27:40.75]Ooh.
[27:42.46]No, did it just disappear?
[27:43.72]No, it's there.
[27:44.38]Don't die from this.
[27:45.74]I died from it.
[27:49.38]Whatever.
[27:54.44]Kevin.
[27:55.36]Kevin.
[28:09.36]Salty?
[28:09.76]I'm not salty right now.
[28:11.94]I'm fine.
[28:16.62]Oh, god dang it.
[28:18.14]Man, it despawned.
[28:25.02]What a joke.
[28:28.26]What a joke.
[28:30.78]I want to play in the train map.
[28:39.84]Too many.
[28:40.92]Too many of these people.
[28:45.79]I've just fought the whole team.
[28:47.41]That was a 1v5 situation.
[28:48.87]What is this, Counter-Strike?
[28:55.05]Get outta here!
[29:02.37]Somebody help me!
[29:04.93]Somebody get Bob Hope away from me!
[29:12.95]Can you put the Razor Death Adder in the next McDonald's Happy Meal?
[29:16.95]Well, if that was going to happen, McDonald's Happy Meals would be like $250.
[29:22.58]You'd have to add a zero to your Happy Meal shit.
[29:31.00]How much is a Happy Meal?
[29:31.82]Two bucks?
[29:33.24]It's $2.50 for a Happy Meal, right?
[29:39.11]How much?
[29:39.33]$3? $3?
[29:43.88]How much is a happy meal?
[29:51.30]And hey gamers, if you want... That would have been fucking funny.
[29:57.43]Too bad I got it ruined because I had to alt tab.
[30:11.49]What, that's six bucks?
[30:14.12]Since when are they $6?
[30:14.64]That's bullshit.
[30:19.36]They should be $2.50.
[30:20.82]Yeah, they should be $2.50.
[30:45.90]There's one.
[30:54.52]Ooh, there's two.
[31:05.21]Where does the dollar joke go?
[31:08.33]Okay, come on, come on, come on, quick.
[31:13.13]Hey gamers.
[31:15.39]You ever wanted to aim like the best?
[31:20.23]It's gonna be easy once you pick up some certain products.
[31:26.57]It's not gonna work.
[31:27.59]It's not gonna work.
[31:30.95]I need to not have to alt tab.
[31:33.55]Can I just bind that to fucking Q or something?
[31:43.17]You're so right.
[31:55.46]Don't give up.
[31:56.76]Yeah, this is the video, right?
[31:59.40]This is for the video.
[32:08.69]Damn it!
[32:15.85]The alt tab stream.
[32:17.27]I wish I had a...
[32:20.40]That guy in first place is really doing work.
[32:31.19]Hold on a second.
[32:31.81]I have no idea what this is.
[32:38.19]We're gonna find out though.
[32:44.33]Pancake recipe?
[32:53.91]That's all I have to say.
[32:54.73]Boo.
[32:57.83]Hey.
[33:00.59]Oh!
[33:01.31]Hey!
[33:01.47]Hey!
[33:02.37]Hey, guys!
[33:05.60]It's me, Greg from NVIDIA.
[33:07.52]Remember me?
[33:09.12]I used to be a lame-o just like you.
[33:11.42]Until I found the Death Adder.
[33:13.88]NVIDIA Death Adder 2.7 Shots like this are no longer part of your imagination.
[33:21.02]Shots like this...
[33:23.43]And this!
[33:25.51]What is this?
[33:34.14]What is this?
[33:40.94]What is this fucking song?
[33:43.31]This is the end of you!
[33:52.01]Maybe a different one ever does.
[33:54.05]Okay, I'm gonna be careful.
[33:56.41]NVIDIA's gonna hear about this and be like, fuck this guy.
[34:09.30]Yeah, the famous NVIDIA dead batter 2.5.
[34:16.16]This is the end of you.
[34:22.18]It's when I get three kills in a row.
[34:24.72]Ooh.
[34:30.46]Get in and go home.
[34:31.50]Alright, this one.
[34:34.52]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[34:35.52]Is that a Remington?
[34:36.31]That thing sucks.
[34:37.73]Get rid of that.
[34:38.21]Hold on.
[34:41.01]Protect me.
[34:41.53]Protect me.
[34:41.99]Protect me.
[34:42.47]Protect me.
[34:42.95]Protect me.
[34:43.47]Protect me.
[34:43.95]Protect me.
[34:45.49]protect me protect me and you took the gun to what the fuck shit I'm back three kills that's a joke what don't you ever make fun of the NVIDIA marketing team guy
[35:13.92]It's three kills.
[35:15.02]That's how you get the sponsorship.
[35:19.30]Don't you guys know?
[35:20.42]It's three kills in a row and then the streamer gets a sponsorship.
[35:28.13]We're gonna make it happen.
[35:33.39]Get out of here!
[35:35.95]You want to let you... Okay, here we go.
[35:38.96]I gotta be good.
[35:39.38]I gotta be really good here.
[35:41.30]I need my fucking sponsorship.
[35:43.60]I need my beef jerky sponsorship.
[35:50.16]How the fuck is this guy still alive?
[36:00.97]How is that guy alive?
[36:01.91]That guy's got a rifle up there too.
[36:08.25]I hate this weapon, by the way.
[36:09.53]This guy's a monster.
[36:17.97]He's the T-Rex.
[36:32.44]This is not rock music!
[36:34.66]Hey guys.
[36:36.37]It's me.
[36:37.21]Fucking... This is not rock music.
[36:47.30]This is like chill out and be depressed in bed music.
[36:59.08]That was not fucking... Hold on.
[37:01.50]Give me another one.
[37:02.20]What the fuck was that?
[37:14.96]Next is near one cent joke.
[37:18.06]Oh, shit.
[37:18.44]Hold on a second.
[37:20.74]Okay.
[37:21.36]Special thank you.
[37:22.12]Special thank you.
[37:23.86]Thank you, Funky Berlin.
[37:25.92]Hope this is enough for your happy meal.
[37:27.22]We need more acid base.
[37:28.16]Thank you for the three bucks, dude.
[37:30.98]Sonicite.
[37:32.86]Thanks for the five dollars.
[37:33.70]Is this how I buy your monitor?
[37:35.04]It's more than five dollars.
[37:36.03]It's like 500, by the way.
[37:40.53]Yeller.
[37:41.17]Thank you, Yeller, for the 700 bits.
[37:43.47]Appreciate it, dude.
[37:45.83]Metal Socks for the five bucks.
[37:46.79]They say super slarm.
[37:49.11]Super slarm.
[37:49.93]I'm not sure what that means, but thank you for the five dollars regardless.
[37:54.25]And then Buzzgit gave that $1,500 earlier.
[37:56.35]Thanks a lot, Buzzgit.
[38:00.51]37 minutes of bad jokes.
[38:02.20]Welcome to my livestream.
[38:05.98]Like, add a zero there.
[38:08.40]This is what we do.
[38:14.66]I get stuck on something and I can't get off of it.
[38:17.92]That's how it works.
[38:20.17]I've been like this my whole life.
[38:22.71]You get me stuck on a ride.
[38:25.65]You know, like, on the Ferris wheel?
[38:28.25]This is the kind of guy that I am.
[38:29.91]Here's a little inside information.
[38:32.21]So when you go to the carnival, and you get to the fair hall, everybody shut up for a second.
[38:35.28]I don't know why this is here.
[38:36.94]Don't do it.
[38:37.32]You're not good enough to get me.
[38:39.54]Not good enough to get me.
[38:43.01]Alright, so I'll get back to this story in a second.
[38:56.75]This is important.
[39:01.05]This is important for my sponsorship.
[39:13.48]Some coffee.
[39:15.02]I got a coffee right in front of me, actually.
[39:20.37]Where is anybody?
[39:21.11]I'm gonna get crept up on from behind, I know it.
[39:23.65]There's a guy up there, a guy down here.
[39:27.39]Got him.
[39:34.04]Got him.
[39:36.66]Who else?
[39:38.60]I am safe to reload right here because everybody's up here.
[39:41.25]My whole team is sitting in this cave.
[39:44.98]Not really a ca- Look.
[39:47.02]What are you guys doing?
[39:47.64]Why would you all run down here?
[39:49.32]Why would you do that?
[39:50.14]I almost just died because of that.
[39:53.87]Why is everybody, like, running?
[39:55.11]Why is everybody becoming one person on the staircase?
[39:57.13]You don't want to do that up here.
[40:03.44]Now I need whiskey.
[40:08.18]Great.
[40:10.08]Great.
[40:12.92]I gotta run this way.
[40:13.88]Back up the stairs.
[40:14.78]There's just dynamite everywhere right now.
[40:25.05]Why are we all stuffed in here?
[40:26.61]There's no reason for us to be in here.
[40:27.96]All of us.
[40:29.44]That's enough.
[40:29.86]That's enough.
[40:30.26]Get it out.
[40:30.80]Don't.
[40:31.46]Oh, come on.
[40:32.24]Out of all the people in this fucking room.
[40:38.26]God damn it.
[40:48.42]Hold on.
[40:49.02]Let's go.
[41:02.97]What gun was that?
[41:09.73]That was the walker.
[41:10.57]Best gun in the game.
[41:13.27]There's two.
[41:25.22]I just need one more.
[41:26.94]Come on, Gwen.
[41:36.33]Come on, Gwen.
[41:37.23]No.
[41:37.35]I get it.
[41:41.09]There you go.
[41:57.78]I'm gonna get that three.
[42:01.72]Ooh, I can feel it.
[42:14.39]Ooh.
[42:17.79]He's right there.
[42:19.15]Nah, you're not gonna fool me.
[42:21.75]Not gonna fool me.
[42:26.04]Hey, gamers.
[42:27.94]It's me, Greg, from NVIDIA.
[42:31.52]Over the last couple of hours, we've had some fun, but I must say I'm a little sad about it.
[42:38.08]Because 2,000 of you didn't sign up with the code to get your free NVIDIA swag bag.
[42:44.72]And unless 2,000 people sign up, Jerma doesn't get the cut of that check.
[42:51.81]So call me a little depressed, gamers.
[42:54.71]Because Jerma needs 2,000 of you to click that button.
[43:01.04]And it makes him sad that he can't get his five grand.
[43:08.38]So gamers, if you can find it in your heart, pick up your $1 swag bag at PAX.
[43:19.20]China, next to you, will be showing off our newest technology.
[43:30.65]Like the NVIDIA Swag Bag!
[43:33.53]Filled with all kinds of products!
[43:35.31]You get a graphics card!
[43:36.49]An NVIDIA GTX 270!
[43:38.89]You get two boxes!
[43:42.02]Two!
[43:42.52]Count of two!
[43:44.01]And you also get, inside that bag, a free car!
[43:48.15]270.
[43:48.17]I have a 270, like, in a computer somewhere.
[44:14.33]There's a car in that bag.
[44:17.55]NVIDIA really stepped it up this year for PAX China.
[44:21.03]Inside their swag bag is a car.
[44:26.21]Imagine if NVIDIA gave away a car to everybody.
[44:28.59]It'd be like Oprah times 50.
[44:30.91]Like 50 fucking thousand people go to PAX.
[44:33.97]Imagine NVIDIA giving away like 35,000 cars.
[44:35.51]And imagine the chaos that would cause.
[44:44.29]Nobody would even go to PAX for any other reason.
[44:48.32]Hey, guys, did you hear that NVIDIA is giving away cars?
[44:51.82]It's like, holy shit!
[44:53.34]People will start fighting each other and shit?
[44:58.24]That would be... That would not be good.
[45:04.47]I gotta be something so boring.
[45:06.93]And put on a different weapon.
[45:08.57]I'm using this the entire time.
[45:10.47]I love this weapon.
[45:12.61]You can dip.
[45:16.20]Let's try the bow.
[45:18.69]Let's be a bow boy for now.
[45:22.15]Somebody kill me, please.
[45:25.94]Ow, okay.
[45:33.33]Oh, by the way, this needs to be said.
[45:36.55]Like, nothing against NVIDIA, right?
[45:38.65]That's just the product that's in my brain right now for no reason.
[45:45.01]So, this is not like a dog on NVIDIA or anything.
[45:48.09]So, in case somebody from NVIDIA watches this, don't sue me for slander.
[45:53.45]It was just a joke.
[45:55.29]Okay, now we can move on.
[46:05.77]Ow.
[46:08.57]Yeah, that was a nice four on our guard break.
[46:10.45]Speaking of that, I should... Watch out.
[46:14.21]I kind of want to play that again.
[46:25.89]We'll do that this coming week.
[46:28.21]Maybe this weekend or something.
[46:29.09]I might just jump on it.
[46:37.23]Come on, I want this red box.
[46:46.44]I want the red box.
[46:47.34]Oh, come on.
[46:48.14]I want the red box, buddy.
[46:49.55]There's too many of you.
[46:50.53]God damn it.
[46:56.39]I could have pulled that off, too.
[47:00.64]Hey, Diabeetles, thank you for the $30.
[47:02.34]$30 from Diabeetles, and they say... Hey, Jerma, how are you doing tonight?
[47:06.89]I just got back together with a girl I really care about up to some troubles, but everything's fine now, and I feel like sharing the love.
[47:12.05]Well, Diabeetles, I'm very happy for you.
[47:16.03]I'm glad you could work it out.
[47:19.25]Hope your night is going fantastic.
[47:20.77]My night's going very well.
[47:27.45]Wait, what?
[47:33.58]I gotta get it done.
[47:36.29]Hey, look it, I am getting it done.
[47:38.89]I'm the second in my field.
[47:42.39]I'm not the first in my field.
[47:43.42]You never want to be the first in your field, you know?
[47:45.08]Because when you're the first in your field, then you're expected to be the best.
[47:48.98]When you're the second in your field, you're expected to be a little bit worse than the first, so you don't have to put as much effort in.
[48:02.67]I gotta get outside.
[48:03.41]There seems to be a running theme with me in this map with this weapon so far as turning the corner and running right into somebody.
[48:20.66]Is Monster Hunter ever coming back?
[48:24.91]Um... Yeah, when it comes up with a switch.
[48:28.99]Like when they make a new one.
[48:30.81]I will definitely play it.
[48:32.79]Because right now I'm playing, like, as much as I was enjoying Monster Hunter 3.
[48:38.62]Isn't that, that's like the older one, isn't there like a 4?
[48:43.16]Monster Hunter 4 is out.
[48:45.36]And I feel like I would, if I want to put a bunch of time into Monster Hunter, I would want to be one of the newer ones.
[48:52.42]So when that game comes out on Switch, which it probably will eventually at some point, then yeah.
[49:06.19]I gotta get rid of this.
[49:06.83]This ain't really working right now.
[49:08.09]Let's go with the... Let's go with like the... The mare's leg.
[49:21.32]I'm gonna go with the marge leg.
[49:24.22]I have not played Final Fantasy XV.
[49:29.76]Final Fantasy XV looks like a lot of...
[49:36.53]I can't kick that guy.
[49:37.29]Why can I not kick that guy in the face?
[49:44.79]Final Fantasy XV is a very long game, right?
[49:47.29]I was thinking of maybe streaming Final Fantasy XV, but... No, it's a whole lot of grinding and walking around and talking to people, right?
[49:59.99]I'm not sure that'd be something I'd want to stream.
[50:03.38]I'd want to play that on my own time, just chilling.
[50:06.05]Although, who knows?
[50:10.85]Maybe eventually.
[50:14.39]Come on, right in the head.
[50:15.97]Ah, that would have been good.
[50:23.60]Oh, boy.
[50:24.36]Here's all the friends.
[50:25.16]I'm dead.
[50:25.46]No, maybe not.
[50:30.64]Not quite.
[50:35.63]There's a battle by this box, that is for sure.
[50:40.61]Nice.
[50:41.07]Okay, I'll protect you.
[50:47.55]Don't bunch up.
[50:51.23]All it takes is one guy with a dynamite to get rid of all of us.
[51:02.70]Shit, too many.
[51:04.00]No!
[51:06.72]Play the Pirates of the Caribbean MMO?
[51:11.24]What?
[51:11.44]That exists?
[51:13.06]Since when does that exist?
[51:20.64]Oh, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme, gimme.
[51:22.16]Alright, we're not gonna go... We're gonna go with a different weapon this time.
[51:23.98]We're gonna go with the... This would be better here.
[51:26.80]We just have to aim.
[51:29.03]This would not be bad at aiming.
[51:36.41]There's another one, he just came in.
[51:42.38]Did you get him?
[51:43.52]Nice, you got him.
[51:53.34]Shit.
[51:54.36]That hurt.
[52:00.11]That hurt.
[52:01.25]No!
[52:03.83]Fucking dynamite, man.
[52:06.43]I'm in deep shit.
[52:13.18]I'm in deep shit.
[52:15.14]I kind of want to open this again, but I feel like I'm gonna die if I do.
[52:20.28]You know, that guy was seriously a nice Dark Souls enemy.
[52:23.82]That guy didn't even exist.
[52:30.31]I broke through a wall to get me.
[52:36.82]Fuck, just go in.
[52:37.70]Don't want to stop fucking kicking this guy in the corner.
[52:42.57]I died.
[52:42.87]I got kicked once and died.
[52:46.75]I kicked him once and he was fine.
[52:59.88]This thing's gotta go.
[53:00.86]Well, the bow ain't working right now.
[53:03.68]Go with the carbine.
[53:07.98]Oh, my back.
[53:08.98]What the fuck?
[53:13.63]My back is not in good shape at the moment.
[53:23.86]When's a clown car stream happening?
[53:26.21]When I buy a clown car.
[53:29.55]Which, who knows when that's gonna be.
[53:30.75]It will happen, though.
[53:40.86]Alright, well... I was waiting for my teammate to kill him.
[53:46.12]But... You know.
[53:49.97]Sometimes it doesn't happen.
[53:54.48]Oh god, I'm just surrounded.
[53:57.14]Surrounded by dynamite.
[54:02.46]Dynamite should just be in the box.
[54:04.88]I'm just done saying it.
[54:07.68]Dynamite should just be in the red box.
[54:11.61]That's it.
[54:15.65]I don't think you should be able to pick dynamite.
[54:20.23]That's all I got to say.
[54:35.57]Have you looked at the price of clown cars?
[54:36.91]Me and my buddy were actually looking at how much they were.
[54:45.68]And weirdly enough, nobody really makes clown cars.
[54:54.15]Get us out of here.
[54:55.49]What do I want to use?
[55:00.79]I'll use this.
[55:11.87]We'd have to get one like custom-made Nobody actually sells them you can't buy them You have to get like a mini Cooper and turn it into a clown car No, I wonder what's gonna happen here, what do you guys think I'm being chased by dynamite Good I want to die anyways give me this
[55:49.66]Every time you play this, I want to play Fistful of Frags.
[55:51.48]Well, I always get an urge to play it because it's just so fun.
[55:56.59]It's just a super, super fun game.
[56:02.44]And every now and again, you get that urge where you just say, hey, I want to play this because it's fun.
[56:08.76]I can always come back to this game.
[56:14.28]Anytime I just want to chill and get some frags, you know?
[56:17.42]Anytime I want to chill and get a sponsorship.
[56:20.50]Get some frags, get sponsored.
[56:25.64]I'll play this.
[56:31.40]Hmm, shit.
[56:40.31]Rip TF2.
[56:41.45]Not necessarily, you know?
[56:42.47]It's funnily enough...
[56:44.93]I was thinking about playing that today.
[56:46.46]I was just sitting there.
[56:50.44]Huh, you know, maybe... I'm just going to wait until the update comes out.
[56:55.06]There's a huge update coming out of that game, right?
[57:00.49]When is the Pyro update coming out?
[57:04.27]You know, the update that they never should have made.
[57:10.24]How many updates does the Pyro have?
[57:12.36]I heard they're doing a Pyro vs. Heavy thing, and I'm like, oh, the Heavy!
[57:17.42]Okay, cool.
[57:18.03]Give the Heavy some new shit.
[57:19.81]No, we're just doing Pyromania 2.
[57:21.61]Oh, okay.
[57:30.28]Pyro has so much shit.
[57:39.98]I'm not saying I'm gonna do it, I was just thinking out loud.
[57:42.89]I was thinking out loud going, you know, maybe I'll play that at some point.
[57:45.19]I'm ready to go.
[58:02.10]I just wanna do a punch kill.
[58:09.32]I guess I'm going to do Pyro first.
[58:13.88]Well, I was going to play TF2, then I realized that they haven't really added anything to the game.
[58:19.08]And I would probably just play it for like 20 minutes and be like, oh yeah, okay, this is fun.
[58:25.27]But once that big, here comes like a bunch of new shit update comes out whenever they're going to do it, I'll probably just jump in and play.
[58:37.44]I wish they would add more man versus machine.
[58:38.94]It's like the coolest thing that Valve ever did with that game, really.
[58:43.86]They just didn't.
[58:44.70]They abandoned it.
[58:50.35]MVM has not had any update, really, at all, right?
[58:53.25]In three years.
[58:55.39]Something like that.
[58:56.73]It's the coolest fucking thing they ever put in the game.
[59:01.55]If they just fully developed Man vs. Machine and forgot about the regular game, I would be happy.
[59:06.66]I'd be like, wow, that's great.
[59:07.56]Man vs. Machine is fucking incredible.
[59:20.72]They ended up focusing on the matchmaking and changing the game to be more towards a competitive where you queue up.
[59:30.03]I think that was a mistake.
[59:33.62]By the way, speaking of mistakes, that was not one.
[59:36.38]Oh, I wish that was him.
[59:50.77]To me, that game was about trying interesting combinations and having fun with friends, just dicking around, having a good time.
[60:00.55]Once they decided that they were going to stop doing that and focus solely on making the game like a competitive matchmaking game, I think that's what killed the game for me.
[60:15.77]And it still isn't even, like, ready.
[60:18.56]They've been, like, working on that for, what, like, two years now?
[60:27.49]No, give me, like, the magic medic amulet.
[60:31.73]I don't care about, like, casual matchmaking cues.
[60:34.57]Give me the magic medic amulet so I can have some fun.
[60:44.74]That was just not fair.
[60:45.96]Spawned right behind me.
[60:46.84]That was unfair.
[60:47.98]I'm sorry, dude.
[60:48.90]You should not have died there.
[60:56.89]Goddamn, really?
[61:03.03]Right in the guy's back.
[61:08.40]Look, I understand the competitive scene of TF2.
[61:11.00]It's very healthy.
[61:13.26]You know, it was.
[61:14.36]At least like a year or two ago.
[61:16.70]People love playing that game competitively.
[61:19.64]Absolutely.
[61:22.60]But when Valve stepped in and decided to make a bunch of changes.
[61:26.20]Take the core game away from what the core game, in my opinion, was supposed to be to begin with.
[61:36.35]I think that's where they made a mistake.
[61:47.03]Ooh, gold box.
[61:48.75]I will take this.
[61:55.66]Is that gold dynamite?
[61:56.60]What the hell does that even do?
[62:05.09]And, you know, if I'm a completely honest streamer, you know, we're going in completely honest streamer mode here.
[62:11.65]I think that Overwatch's release changed the way that they were making that game.
[62:19.71]Because Valve, a competitive matchmaking mode, a queuing up casual mode, where you actually, you know queuing for servers, like Valve servers are just, you queue up and matchmaking and MMR, that type of thing.
[62:35.13]That game's been around for like a decade.
[62:38.49]And they never really gave a shit about that.
[62:40.19]Then Overwatch kind of came out and they were like, maybe we should give a shit about this now.
[62:51.00]Which, again, I think was a mistake.
[63:03.77]How am I still alive right now?
[63:05.51]I had like three opportunities to die.
[63:08.45]The competitive stuff was in development before Overwatch's announcement.
[63:12.89]But even if that's... Let's say that's the case, right?
[63:15.59]Even if that is the case.
[63:18.09]TF2 had been out for a decade.
[63:22.81]The communities that were developed already had development.
[63:33.17]I mean, was it in development?
[63:34.41]Sure, but saying that is like... Do you know how much stuff was probably in development with that game over 10 years and they just never really gave a shit about it?
[63:45.22]They probably had some competitive mode in mind that was in its alpha stage for 8 years.
[63:50.70]Like, that would not surprise me in the least.
[63:56.11]Considering how long it takes Valve to really do anything.
[64:27.79]He can't play without his golden gun.
[64:33.55]The tutorial isn't even finished.
[64:35.57]Right.
[64:41.43]I made a video about it.
[64:42.43]Yeah, but my point is that they have always been talking about that.
[64:49.53]Valve has always been talking about making a competitive mode.
[64:54.19]But when Overwatch released and was actually announced and put into beta and everything, I think that gave them a, okay, let's focus on this now.
[65:04.26]They never focused on it.
[65:07.20]They talked about it.
[65:08.00]They made announcements about it, but it was not something that they ever focused on.
[65:12.68]They're focusing on that now.
[65:14.06]That's something that's a main focus of the TF2 dev team is that casual queue and the competitive matchmaking right now.
[65:21.44]That's something that is a priority for them.
[65:23.72]It never was.
[65:24.18]It never used to be.
[65:26.24]So even if it was being made, it was not a priority.
[65:28.96]Because if it was a priority, that shit would have been put in the game five fucking years ago.
[65:35.34]A long time ago.
[65:39.35]They would have put a matchmaking beta in the game when Man vs. Machine came out.
[65:43.91]Because that was when they first... That's a matchmaking queue.
[65:47.17]That Man vs. Machine queue was a matchmaking queue.
[65:49.51]They had it in the game.
[65:50.27]It existed.
[65:57.78]So when Man vs. Machine came out, they probably were talking about it.
[65:59.98]Like, oh yeah, we can actually probably use this for actual matchmaking.
[66:04.92]Get Danny to start working on that.
[66:07.65]Should anybody else work on it?
[66:08.82]No, no, no.
[66:09.68]Just Danny will work on it once a year for 20 minutes.
[66:13.92]Okay.
[66:26.20]The devs openly agree that matchmaking had a very rocky start and there's only five programmers confirmed on the team.
[66:35.35]That makes sense to me.
[66:37.33]Did I even pick a weapon?
[66:38.65]Have I just been aimlessly talking without a weapon?
[66:42.31]Yes, to answer that question, yes.
[66:45.88]That is what happened.
[66:54.74]Valve wants you to stop playing TF2 and play CSGO.
[66:58.07]I don't know how true that is.
[67:00.69]I think that TF2 just became...
[67:05.18]It's not... It's just an old game.
[67:08.06]They support it still and they love it, but... They have way bigger fish to fry, I think, Valve, at this point.
[67:13.68]They have their own virtual reality headset.
[67:15.89]They have their entire business platform with Steam.
[67:19.33]They have Dota 2, which is like the biggest fucking game in the world.
[67:24.05]You know what I mean?
[67:24.55]It's... Dota 2 is one of the biggest games in the world.
[67:28.91]So, you obviously are going to have a development team.
[67:31.51]You're going to put more people on that team than Team Fortress, you know?
[67:36.91]They'll still put people on it.
[67:39.17]But CSGO and Dota, you can't really compare the two to Team Fortress.
[67:47.84]How did that happen?
[67:48.46]Why did he not drop a weapon?
[67:51.66]Shouldn't he have dropped whatever was in this box?
[67:53.22]I mean, like, what?
[68:01.13]I'm totally fine babysitting this box.
[68:03.59]As long as I get what's inside.
[68:04.61]And don't get sniped.
[68:07.86]In fact, speaking of snipe... Yeah, gamers, we're gonna do some sniping right now.
[68:15.44]Give me the rifle.
[68:19.21]Alright, let's make this count.
[68:25.11]Don't do it!
[68:26.65]Oh, fucking God!
[68:32.23]The one time the guy comes up the stairs, I swear to god I have like the worst fucking ferris wheel luck.
[68:37.12]Speaking of ferris wheels.
[68:38.46]So you know when you're on a ferris wheel.
[68:40.96]And you... Hold on, I gotta... No, you're not.
[68:58.04]I'm getting that.
[68:58.83]I'm taking that from you, buddy.
[69:01.21]That's my gun.
[69:03.11]Where'd it go?
[69:10.39]We're doing this again.
[69:13.35]I'm going to have this happen.
[69:29.84]Ooh, you were trying to snipe me with your sniper.
[69:33.43]Nice try.
[69:34.29]Nice.
[69:35.59]I have your gun.
[69:42.16]Fight me honorably.
[69:42.88]I got you.
[69:43.66]I got you with a headshot.
[69:46.62]Ow.
[70:07.87]No.
[70:14.15]Damn it.
[70:21.21]My hands... I'm getting so cold right now.
[70:26.67]Like seriously, when you get this cold... You know when you go to a carnival and you're freezing cold, right?
[70:33.39]And you get on that ferris wheel...
[70:36.00]The Ferris Wheel, seriously, is one of those... God damn.
[70:45.59]Something about, like, heated seats.
[70:46.65]This guy's just got a rifle.
[71:05.20]Low blood pressure?
[71:05.98]Yeah.
[71:07.68]That is something that I have.
[71:11.56]Like, when I get up in the morning, if I get up too fast, I will like... The world closes in on me.
[71:30.17]No, you don't.
[71:31.03]No, you don't.
[71:32.91]This is too many people.
[71:36.76]There's just too many people.
[71:38.48]Like, this one time, I was on a Ferris wheel with, like, like, ten people were sitting in, like, one of the seats.
[71:47.30]And, you know, when a Ferris wheel turns, it goes very slowly.
[71:52.91]So, the guy next to me was eating a bag of popcorn.
[71:55.91]I'll never forget it.
[71:59.92]I gotta, no, I'm changing buttons.
[72:03.14]We're gonna go hatchet.
[72:06.20]Take out the hatchet and we'll go from there.
[72:08.32]Let me go back up here.
[72:16.04]Where did that guy go?
[72:20.73]Where the fuck is he?
[72:30.21]Nice, I get this guy.
[72:32.66]One more shot and this guy's done.
[72:35.89]No, he has one HP.
[72:40.14]But anyways.
[72:41.74]So... This guy had a bag of popcorn.
[72:45.38]And he was eating it very loudly.
[72:47.68]And... The worker, the guy that was making the Ferris wheel go around... Was like, no food on the Ferris wheel!
[72:54.49]And the guy turned to him and gave him this dirty look.
[72:57.11]And then looked at me and gave me seriously the best advice... I've ever received from a person.
[73:01.67]Like, to this day, this has stuck with me forever.
[73:04.27]And...
[73:10.60]I don't want that.
[73:18.09]Should I put... I don't think I want to use this.
[73:22.15]I think I'm going to use... I want the machete.
[73:26.31]Oh, got him right in the balls.
[73:38.75]Man, you see that guy?
[73:39.69]I got that guy right in the crotchal area.
[73:46.95]What are you doing?
[73:50.20]Why are you doing this?
[73:52.58]That wasn't in the head?
[73:54.76]What?
[74:03.95]finish the story of what oh oh right right right so the guy turned to me he gave me this look that I I will never forget it and like I said this advice is life-changing advice ferris wheel started to go up and he kept the bag of popcorn in his hands didn't turn it down didn't take it out of his mouth the attendant was screaming at him but we get we got to the top you know like he was like put that down we get to the very top
[74:32.05]Guy puts the bag of popcorn down, looks me right in the eyes.
[74:34.95]And this changed my life.
[74:37.25]And it's something that I've lived by forever.
[74:39.71]And it's extremely important advice.
[74:41.53]It's something that I really want to share with you guys.
[74:45.21]He looked me dead in the face.
[74:48.49]And without missing a beat.
[74:52.48]Fucking... I hate the fact that you get lit on fire.
[75:04.12]No, fuck it.
[75:04.56]We're just going dynamite.
[75:06.80]I'm just gonna be the dynamite asshole and try to get somebody.
[75:26.22]Guys, there is no ferris wheel story!
[75:28.44]There's no ferris wheel story!
[75:29.78]Have you figured it out yet?
[75:32.12]There's no story!
[75:39.09]Everyone's like, finish the story, finish the story.
[75:41.61]There is no story.
[75:44.79]Yeah, I sat on a Ferris wheel with a fat guy.
[75:47.37]And the seat got really warm.
[75:50.00]That's the story.
[75:55.38]It was, like, gross.
[76:04.67]Right in the tube.
[76:07.11]Yeah.
[76:14.35]Give him money as punishment.
[76:18.55]Wait, what?
[76:20.03]I actually think, you know, here's the funny thing.
[76:22.07]There was a Ferris wheel thing that I was going to say like an hour ago, but I fucking don't even know what I was even saying.
[76:28.67]I forgot it.
[76:30.12]And then people, I'm looking over in chat.
[76:31.70]It was just some like little thing I was going to say like, oh, blah, blah, blah.
[76:35.42]Something about the Ferris wheel.
[76:36.50]I don't even know what it was going to be.
[76:38.52]I forget.
[76:38.86]And like an hour later, I'm looking over at chat and they're like, hey, finish the Ferris wheel story.
[76:44.44]I'm like, what?
[76:45.86]I don't even remember what it was now.
[76:47.50]So, there you go.
[76:48.80]You're like, there is no story.
[76:50.96]Oh, come on.
[76:57.40]I did so much damage to everybody.
[77:01.87]Dead.
[77:02.57]This guy, just don't be good at aiming.
[77:05.01]He was good at aiming.
[77:13.12]Oh, you know what kind of guy I am?
[77:23.51]I had something.
[77:24.41]I don't even know.
[77:25.09]I had something, but I don't fucking even remember what it was.
[77:38.89]Alright, I'm gonna- this- I'm- time to go bad.
[77:41.39]This was the joke, was me picking dynamite to stall.
[77:51.73]Oh, you're doing the same thing I was doing.
[77:55.34]Red team is on a rampage right now.
[78:02.20]Clickbait is the kind of guy- I have not clickbait, please, come on!
[78:07.36]If there's one thing I know that I'm not, I'm certain of, is that I am not clickbait.
[78:14.30]You understand?
[78:28.89]Please, do not accuse me of clickbait.

[86:13.18]The game could be, like, a piece of shit.
[86:14.92]As long as it's one of those 12-digit codes and it works.
[86:18.94]Then I want it.
[86:26.53]Because that's how we're going to give away the free shit.

[92:44.65]I'm gagging on free shit.
[92:48.81]Let's take this a little seriously, guys.
[92:53.43]Let's get a string.
[92:54.47]Let's get like 3 or 4 kills in a row.
[92:57.57]Because we are streaming a video game right now.
[93:00.09]And it's important that we do that.
[93:03.65]It's important we stream this game.

[93:49.80]That was way too fast.
[93:53.00]You know what I mean?
[93:58.16]That was a little too fast.
[94:03.77]We gotta at least build the suspense a tiny bit, right?
[94:12.05]I'm having, like, fun.
[94:13.09]This is fucking funny.
[94:19.50]Dermot's giving codes to bots?

[94:26.32]No, it's gotta be prepared for the free shit!
[94:35.49]Alright, hold on.

[94:48.56]I'm like locked out of my Discord.
[94:50.16]I have to look at it on my iPhone.
[94:55.16]Alright, let's go.
[95:00.16]That happened a little too fast for my liking.
[95:02.92]So we're not going to do that again.
[95:06.28]Oh shit, wait a minute, wait, wait a minute!
[95:08.02]There it is again!

[95:55.32]People are just, like, loading up free codes.
[95:57.64]Invalid code!
[95:58.90]Wait...
[96:05.75]It wasn't even real.
[96:11.23]Shit wasn't even real.
[96:12.51]It wasn't even a real code.
[96:16.35]Let's get pumped up for that free shit.
[96:19.48]Oh my god.
[96:20.14]Alright, let's try this one.
[96:26.30]This is really making me happy, man.

[96:58.77]You're gonna have to figure out what it is.
[97:01.25]I can tell you what it is.
[97:02.52]Good luck free shit.
[97:03.16]Oh
[97:06.67]Let me make sure I get the code right.
[97:17.16]I think that's right.
[97:17.80]Let me just make sure it's correct.
[97:20.16]Alright.
[97:20.98]So.

[97:50.99]Alright, yeah.
[97:54.91]It's a number.

[97:58.60]Good luck.
[97:59.75]This time the bots can't... If a bot's taking it, a bot's not going to be able to take this shit.
[98:03.67]It's going to be a number.
[98:04.29]It's a number when you hear that guitar riff.
[98:08.99]Get ready.
[98:09.53]By the way, we need a better guitar riff than that.
[98:11.11]I'm just going to type in fucking guitar riff.

[99:09.48]What the fuck is going on here?
[99:13.27]What?
[99:15.51]Why is that guy unkillable?
[99:27.46]Bingo.
[99:32.16]I've seen people spamming some free shit here, but it's not time for any free shit.
[99:36.05]I'm not sure why I'm seeing this.
[99:40.35]It's not time for free shit, guys.
[99:49.90]You'll know when it's time for free shit when you hear that super awesome guitar lick.
[100:01.53]Where is the other team?
[100:17.67]Whoa.
[100:21.05]Too many activations.
[100:31.29]This is one of my favorite maps.
[100:32.65]I would say.
[100:33.39]For sure.
[100:36.82]That was three clean hits.
[100:54.09]How did... They have like two guys... Ow!
[101:05.23]How am I supposed to get free shit if I don't even know what to listen for?
[101:09.51]This guy's gotta go.
[101:10.25]I need his gun.
[101:11.71]See, now he's on the run.
[101:16.21]There it is.
[101:16.73]Give me that rifle.
[101:17.85]Let's get something going.
[101:19.53]Come on.
[101:21.13]Gotta play the game here.
[101:22.13]Damn it.
[101:28.93]Where was that?
[101:32.07]That's not hitting.
[101:36.30]I should have hit him like three times.
[101:41.42]I'm dead.
[101:46.28]I'm dead.
[101:54.60]Cass the fucking whiskey.
[101:56.32]Wow, this is like the worst I've done since turning the stream on.
[102:08.70]Can you tell us the number after?
[102:09.80]I will.
[102:18.28]Ooh, give me that rifle!
[102:23.34]No!
[102:24.62]Shit!
[102:34.45]What a gamer.
[102:37.26]I care more about this dumb fucking joke than I do the game right now.
[102:42.40]I'm sure that's painfully obvious at this point.
[102:49.83]Like, when I'm looking for people, they're never around.
[102:51.55]Wait, this is going to be like three people coming up here.
[103:01.35]I can already tell.
[103:04.70]I wish I could get the actual sharps rifle.
[103:14.12]Shit.
[103:22.98]I feel like those should be hitting.
[103:25.56]Why am I missing those?
[103:26.46]Oh my god.
[103:41.70]Fred, come on.
[103:46.05]Yeah, the yellow.
[103:47.07]The sharps rifle just is an instant kill.
[103:49.79]I have like hit detection problems with the yellow.
[103:52.87]I just never get it to work.
[103:53.74]It's like a tiny little spot in that little iron sight.
[103:57.38]I don't like it.
[104:03.06]Not a fan.
[104:03.72]Whoa!
[104:16.67]Don't scare me like that Stream sucks with the free shit Be patient I have to play the game I have to get like five kills Streams gonna end without a code No, that's not true
[104:52.69]I'm gonna climb up to at least like 10th place.
[104:54.25]And remember, it is a number at the end.
[105:13.40]There's a final character, it's a number.
[105:19.58]Here it comes!
[105:24.56]This is fucking stupid.
[105:33.15]There it goes.
[105:34.89]Oh, this is fucking terrible.
[105:41.17]What the fuck?
[105:46.25]How did somebody already get it?
[105:51.08]There's no way somebody already got that.
[105:55.00]It was three.
[105:58.00]Yeah, it was three.
[105:59.94]How did you know that?
[106:00.56]How did you guys fucking know that?
[106:01.62]How is that possible?
[106:10.09]You call this a royalty-free guitar rift?
[106:12.13]Alright, well... Alright, dude, this next time, I'm doing a whole row.
[106:25.37]We're doing like the last three.
[106:35.14]Three rhymes with free.
[106:43.37]Yeah, by the way, thank you to people that are just putting in...
[106:48.70]Uh, game codes.
[106:49.48]You don't have to be doing that.
[106:50.40]Anybody?
[106:50.72]People that are giving the codes, the actual ones that we're using too?
[106:53.08]Uh, that's... Thank you for making, uh, enabling this joke.
[106:57.52]Appreciate it.
[106:59.94]There's too many activation attempts.
[107:08.34]Well, it's just a joke anyway.
[107:09.96]What was the code for?
[107:12.46]I believe it was for... Tower of Elements or something?
[107:26.01]Give codes.
[107:37.36]Yeah, the joke is, it's time to kill this joke.
[107:40.86]We had our fun.
[107:44.90]Like somebody got a game code.
[107:48.87]Here, I know at least like five people, at least like four people got a game code.
[107:56.49]Oh, you have the best gun.
[107:57.37]Thank you for this.
[108:05.26]I will sit in this corner.
[108:07.80]But there's more codes.
[108:12.96]No.
[108:13.36]Oh my god, how the fuck did I miss that many times in a row?
[108:21.72]Oh, that's so fucking aggravating.

[109:00.41]Oh, they're a little too chilly.
[109:02.07]Fucking put some gloves on.
[109:04.07]What?
[109:07.95]The tips of my fingers get a little numb sometimes.
[109:10.57]I need to rub some salve on them.
[109:14.13]Honey, can you do grandma a favor and go get a salve?
[109:19.05]Vaseline.

[110:43.38]That guy just got a triple kick.
[110:48.32]Wow!
[110:49.16]I've never seen that in this game.
[110:52.06]In the countless hours I've played.
[110:53.78]Holy shit, that was incredible.
[111:02.41]That dude, did he throw his gun and hit all of us?
[111:06.97]We were the bad guy from every Ninja Turtles movie.
[111:11.89]Did you guys ever notice that?
[111:14.99]When the hero kicks the first guy.
[111:19.10]all the other guys all get hurt too you know like the the bad guy will get hit and like his three heads behind him oh you threw something at that guy we all fall down we all got hurt we need more terrible music
[111:51.00]Is that guy running faster than normal?
[111:54.85]That was a fast run.
[111:55.77]Alright, what do I want from here?
[112:02.97]Of course I know what I want.
[112:04.43]I know what I want every time.
[112:06.57]It never changes.
[112:07.19]No, don't do that.
[112:21.31]Two.
[112:22.87]That's two.
[112:32.20]No, no more free shit.
[112:34.10]No more free shit.
[112:34.88]I have to stream this game.
[112:40.02]I'm about to go on a run here.
[112:44.97]Fuck.
[112:45.39]I need whiskey.
[112:51.26]Where did these guys even come from?
[112:52.34]Where the fuck did they even come from?
[113:03.16]You know, this did used to be a cartoon music stream.
[113:05.38]You're right.
[113:07.78]Long time ago.
[113:15.81]Fuck.
[113:20.70]Five killstreaks, pretty shit.
[113:37.47]Frank some toons.
[113:41.43]What time is it right now?
[113:42.15]Like nine.
[113:43.99]When am I going to stream Skate 3 again?
[113:49.66]That's a great question.
[113:51.76]Because I don't remember every streaming Skate 3 once.
[114:02.94]Not one of those hit him in the face.
[114:05.03]What?
[114:06.05]Hey, Hilifrag.
[114:08.33]Hilifragosaurus, thank you for the 10 bucks.
[114:11.65]This used to be a clown car stream.
[114:13.03]It's true.
[114:17.16]It will be a car crash.
[114:18.32]Remember, I've got to start paying attention to the guy.
[114:26.19]Term has a bad memory.
[114:27.19]I've never played that game.
[114:30.25]I remember I wanted to play that game.
[114:31.97]I had thoughts that I wanted to play, but never really pulled the trigger on it.
[114:39.50]I'm not sure I would like that game anyways.
[114:41.60]You know, maybe a little too difficult.
[114:44.84]You know, I'll give that guy.
[114:45.68]That guy just got the 8-ball in the corner pocket.
[114:47.40]I'll take it.
[114:48.02]That's fine.
[114:49.94]He had an opportunity and he took it and he got it.
[114:51.56]Why am I seeing Kevin again?
[115:00.52]Did the guy named Kevin just kill me?
[115:10.32]I'm confused.
[115:10.96]Why do I see Kevin?
[115:26.84]Don't let him get off with that.
[115:27.96]Don't thank you.
[115:32.66]Don't let him kill us.
[115:42.60]back here.
[115:46.23]I mean, I know it's a meme, but... Why did everybody just start spamming it?
[115:53.27]Fuck, and there was whiskey right there.
[116:04.56]Don't fuck with Darren.
[116:09.62]Why am I holding the gun on the left hand?
[116:11.68]Because it's a specialization.
[116:15.06]Grants best single handgun accuracy for primary and fanning modes.
[116:18.60]As a downside, gives worst accuracy in dual weld.
[116:20.65]So, it's just the most accurate.
[116:22.97]Whereas right-handed grants higher accuracy than ambidextrous in single right-handed mode.
[116:27.83]Moderately accuracy penalty for dual weld mode.
[116:29.99]It just makes it so you're the most accurate with a single shot.
[116:37.37]I like using single shots.
[116:40.32]It's my favorite.
[116:49.08]Informative streamer, yeah.
[116:51.89]Alright, let's go.
[117:00.77]Shit.
[117:08.34]Check your corners.
[117:08.98]So you check your corners and then get killed by the dynamite.
[117:15.26]He just hurt himself with that.
[117:16.38]One hit.
[117:17.67]What the fuck is going on?
[117:25.93]Oh.
[117:28.29]I don't like having 34 health.
[117:29.01]That means I can die in one hit.
[117:30.97]From pretty much anything.
[117:33.61]Most shit in this game will always do like 40 damage.
[117:37.09]I'm dead.
[117:46.05]When am I gonna play another terrible game?
[117:47.53]I don't know.
[117:51.81]I don't really have plans for stuff like that.
[117:54.33]They just kind of come up and I'm like, yeah, why not?
[117:56.23]I don't really ever have a plan.
[118:00.78]Unless it's one of those things like a Presto Majesto type situation where I have to plan it.
[118:10.08]Shit.
[118:12.02]Oh my lord.
[118:14.80]Come on.
[118:15.66]Come on.
[118:16.00]Give me the walker.
[118:16.52]Give me the walker.
[118:17.14]I can get a string here.
[118:17.86]Let me get like 10.
[118:18.42]Just gotta be careful.
[118:23.22]Full health.
[118:24.10]Where did you even come from?
[118:26.69]Where the fuck?
[118:27.73]What?
[118:29.11]What the fuck just happened right there?
[118:31.13]That was not fucking cool.
[118:39.28]What on Earth was that?
[118:50.70]Yeah, I kind of just go with the flow.
[118:53.20]Whatever I feel like doing.
[118:54.38]I plan streams.
[118:55.44]Like, obviously, the Resident Evil VR shit was planned.
[118:58.62]I had to get all that together and figure it out.
[119:03.79]But, like, day to day, like, just every stream, I usually go, hey, what do I kind of, what do I feel like doing today?
[119:10.15]Sometimes I'll do, like, a playthrough.
[119:11.65]Sometimes I'll do something stupid.
[119:13.91]Sometimes I'll just chill and play Fistful of Frags.
[119:22.15]I like to keep myself on my toes and not be comfortable, ever.
[119:26.28]I feel like that's how I get myself in the best situations.
[119:31.42]I'm gonna keep it interesting for myself.
[119:34.10]It's not really having a, like, plan of what I'm going to do.
[119:38.82]Makes it more fun that way.
[119:45.87]Fallout gambling.
[119:46.89]Am I in fourth place?
[119:52.29]I don't think I'm going to catch the guy in third place.
[120:00.14]Right in his face.
[120:01.64]He's dead, right?
[120:04.08]Do I still play Smite?
[120:05.14]From time to time, I do.
[120:07.18]It depends on how... How I'm feeling.
[120:14.11]I get into these weird modes where I play a game for a month and I don't play it for a year.
[120:19.11]And that did happen with Smite pretty recently.
[120:21.81]I swear to God, these people are just appearing behind me.
[120:29.75]Yeah, Resident Evil 7 DLC, I'm going to probably do that on Thursday.
[120:34.60]Did anything else come up for PS4 that I could play?
[120:37.96]If I play a PS4 game, I kind of have to stay on PS4.
[120:43.00]So I can't... The DLC for Resident Evil 7, I can't imagine will be more than an hour or two.
[120:48.52]So I kind of need something to transition to.
[120:53.25]Anything interesting come up for PS4 over the last week or two?
[120:55.95]Because there's all kinds of audio delay issues when you capture with a capture card that I have that I can't transition from this to PC, from like PS4 to PC.
[121:12.91]Give Nioh another chance.
[121:13.87]That's true.
[121:16.11]I really should give that.
[121:17.19]I was just like shit-faced playing that game and getting angry.
[121:21.18]I really need to give that game a solid actual chance.
[121:23.76]There's always Peggle.
[121:29.81]We'll see.
[121:33.21]But the initial stream is going to be PS4 VR.
[121:38.23]The DLC.
[121:40.03]See what it is.
[121:46.64]No more heroes.
[121:50.48]on ps4 I thought that was on Xbox did they actually make that on ps4 too I would I would play that that game was awesome I remember that game near what is n-I-e-r near what's that
[122:20.50]Imagine Peggle VR.
[122:22.12]You are the ball.
[122:25.12]I feel like people would really get sick playing that.
[122:27.26]Although, that might be kind of fun.
[122:35.09]Yakuza?
[122:35.67]I could play Yakuza.
[122:37.89]There are options.
[122:38.47]I'll just have to take a look and see.
[122:46.47]We'll see what we do.
[122:47.63]But I know Friday is going to be a moving stream.
[122:52.64]All three of these guys have dynamite.
[122:53.74]What are they doing?
[122:55.02]All three of these fucking assholes just ran in here with dynamite.
[122:59.80]There's another guy.
[123:00.80]There's another guy with dynamite.
[123:04.98]What is going on here?
[123:05.96]What is with this?
[123:07.75]Four dudes.
[123:09.61]Is this a scripted event in the game or what?
[123:13.41]Ooh, remade wild guns.
[123:14.43]Yeah, definitely.
[123:20.43]Absolutely going to check that out.
[123:31.96]What'd you have?
[123:33.66]Navy.
[123:39.94]What is the Friday stream?
[123:40.72]It's going to be the movies.
[123:42.98]I have a very specific thing that I want to do on Friday.
[123:46.65]I don't know how long the stream on Friday will be, but know that there will be effort put into it.
[123:51.85]Regardless if the stream is less than an hour.
[123:54.67]It's going to be one of those streams.
[124:03.24]I think you guys will enjoy it.
[124:05.64]If I were to take a guess.
[124:19.15]No, your friend came in with a gun!
[124:34.48]So is the Wild Guns remake a 3D remake?
[124:39.00]Or is it just sort of polished up and ported?
[124:41.42]This guy right here.
[124:48.61]Watch it.
[124:49.45]Alright.
[124:50.03]Be a distraction while I get the walker.
[124:54.99]No, that's not what I... I freaked out and I just picked this up because I freaked out.
[125:02.48]How the fuck did that not hit him in the face?
[125:05.52]It's not 3D.
[125:11.97]It's just like a polished up remake.
[125:14.41]Reimagining, I guess.
[125:18.59]There's something behind me.
[125:22.72]That guy's lagging all over the place.
[125:28.96]Two new characters?
[125:31.90]Cool.
[125:41.57]Why does that guy have the rifle up here?
[125:49.25]Oh, fuck.
[125:52.24]Minecraft?
[125:53.00]I'm not going to play Minecraft on stream.
[125:58.82]I'm never going to play Minecraft again.
[126:00.34]You know how long I... Here's the only way I'd play Minecraft ever again.
[126:03.15]Is... Is if somebody hid...
[126:11.65]in the game that I was playing in.
[126:13.01]Like some secret code that gave me like $500,000.
[126:18.07]And I had to like go dig and find it.
[126:21.87]Actually, no, that would be horrible because isn't it as big as like Earth?
[126:26.59]I would never find that.
[126:27.84]Would you be able to ever find that?
[126:30.75]Okay, if I went into Minecraft and I just no-clipped for like 50 minutes in a random spot and went down into the Earth somewhere and in some cave put like a little picture that if you found it you got $500,000.
[126:45.66]Would anybody be able to get it?
[126:50.05]Would anyone find that?
[126:50.89]I don't think that's possible.
[127:04.79]They're, like, infinite.
[127:05.65]Yeah.
[127:10.52]Make it all free shit!
[127:15.84]Have I ever played an anime-based game?
[127:19.10]I don't... I don't know.
[127:20.92]You mean, like, a video game based on an anime?
[127:24.64]Ugh.
[127:26.04]Like, 12 years ago, I played the Fullmetal Alchemist PlayStation 2 game.
[127:32.44]And that was, like, more than a decade ago, though.
[127:35.04]So, I mean, not really.
[127:36.22]Not that I can think of.
[127:47.19]Oh, you just got rocked into the ground.
[127:54.55]I remember that game.
[127:55.33]Yeah, I remember that game was... That game was really bad.
[127:58.57]And how... How... Why did you...
[128:11.07]Only dweebs watch anime?
[128:13.99]That's not true.
[128:17.77]That's not true.
[128:26.98]There were so many people on the other team.
[128:28.40]That was an AI-filled room.
[128:33.82]There were too many people on the other team standing in the same spot.
[128:48.67]You can watch anime and not be like a dweeb?
[128:50.61]What are you talking about?
[128:51.45]I don't watch very much of it, but... I watch some.
[129:05.51]The one thing that I have trouble doing with anything like anime is very specifically is I don't like shows that are like three or four hundred episodes long.
[129:15.57]It's just like I don't I don't even want to watch them.
[129:19.23]I would rather read a Wikipedia article about the show than watch it if it has like four hundred episodes.
[129:29.61]I will watch an anime.
[129:33.20]if it's less than 50 to 100 episodes for the entire series.
[129:38.67]I will not watch them if they're different.
[129:40.91]If they're longer than that, I will not.
[129:43.47]No.
[129:55.52]But it's even pushing it, going past that.
[130:00.00]uh Kim and I right now are watching we're in the middle of watching kenshin and that show already is it's like what like 100 episodes almost 100 something maybe like just over 100 or just 90 something like that and you can see like this there's quite a lot of filler in there so let's talk about fighting for like 20 minutes and then next episode we actually swing a sword
[130:29.75]One Punch Man.
[130:30.37]I'm waiting for One Punch Man to be finished.
[130:32.97]Or at least close to it before I start watching it.
[130:43.50]I've heard a lot of good things about One Punch Man, but I'd rather just watch it when it's ready to be done, I guess.
[131:01.56]Watch shorter animes.
[131:04.01]I mean, I do.
[131:05.79]I'd say like once a year I will watch an anime from start to finish.
[131:10.45]Once a year.
[131:12.93]Gotta be ready for it.
[131:13.87]I gotta wanna watch it.
[131:14.75]I gotta have to be into whatever the show is.
[131:18.63]And there's enough animes that exist where my one anime a year restriction will work until I die.
[131:28.08]I will always have an interesting anime to watch.
[131:32.26]Forever.
[131:32.92]Because I only watch one a year.
[131:35.88]I'll be good.
[131:36.26]That guy didn't die.
[131:55.31]My favorite anime is SpongeBob.
[131:59.79]animated shows.
[132:08.45]One anime a year?
[132:11.01]Yeah.
[132:13.33]Nice duck.
[132:15.22]I cannot hit this guy.
[132:18.32]Yeah.
[132:24.42]Free kill, but I died.
[132:27.04]Dead.
[132:34.18]Cowboy Bebop is your shorty.
[132:35.20]Yeah, it is.
[132:36.02]It's a classic.
[132:41.58]It's one of those classic animes.
[132:46.37]What's an anime that I recommend?
[132:47.57]I've never watched one.
[132:48.69]I think the easiest answer there is Fullmetal Alchemist.
[132:51.81]It's just like, that's like the most mainstream friendly anime I think I've ever seen.
[132:58.42]It's like, what, 60 episodes?
[133:00.73]It's interesting.
[133:01.45]It's got interesting characters.
[133:03.37]The fights are cool.
[133:06.75]That's like the anime starter pack if somebody does not know what it is or doesn't watch it.
[133:11.73]I'd say it would probably be Fullmetal Alchemist.
[133:21.80]Ow.
[133:22.88]Yes, I'm watching Kenshin on Netflix.
[133:38.28]Never seen Death Note.
[133:41.06]I heard it was, like, good.
[133:42.54]But... Remember, I'm on my once-a-year limit.
[133:46.20]And we're watching all of Kenshin.
[133:47.66]So this is the once-a-year limit.
[133:49.91]We'll see.
[133:50.17]Maybe next year.
[133:50.67]Maybe I'll watch Death Note next year.
[133:57.89]Otherwise, I'm going to be grounded.
[133:59.17]I'm going to be on... Oh, boy.
[134:00.61]This guy's just dynamiting me.
[134:11.08]If you're out of bullets, that means I get to kill you.
[134:19.23]Would you ever go to Anime Boston?
[134:20.63]I did.
[134:22.51]Me and Star went to Anime Boston like two, three years ago.
[134:26.87]Yeah, like three years ago now.
[134:30.03]Am I talking about Brotherhood?
[134:34.41]Well, Brotherhood's better.
[134:36.23]Because obviously the show got really popular and they probably got more money.
[134:43.65]The original one is good, but Brotherhood, I think, follows the actual storyline.
[134:50.42]Because halfway through Fullmetal Alchemist, the original one, they ran out of manga material.
[134:57.00]So they had to make up their own shit.
[134:59.43]And then they made the show again when the story was done.
[135:04.01]And did the actual story for Brotherhood.
[135:07.10]I would probably say just to watch Brotherhood.
[135:08.60]If you don't want to watch the two of the same exact show, because they are the exact fucking same show for the first dozen episodes.
[135:17.33]I would say just watch Brotherhood.
[135:19.81]If you don't want to watch them both.
[135:25.69]Really?
[135:37.06]Ow.
[135:37.62]Did I get him in the head?
[135:40.82]That was an interesting shot.
[135:42.64]Come on.
[135:43.62]I'm not going that way.
[135:47.42]I'm going to instantly die.
[135:49.64]Ow.
[135:52.56]Didn't they have to do similar things with Game of Thrones?
[135:54.42]Yep.
[135:56.22]Game of Thrones is pretty much out of book material at this point.
[136:01.99]There's some things that they have not covered from the books.
[136:05.00]But major plot points and major storylines... They're out of stuff to do.
[136:11.56]And who fucking knows... When that book is coming out.
[136:16.52]The Winds of Winter is never releasing.
[136:18.77]It's never happening.
[136:19.33]It's not gonna happen.
[136:22.33]I'm convinced at this point that George R.R.
[136:23.85]Martin is just like... Just delaying it over and over again until...
[136:29.90]He just comes clean and says, it's not going to be ever done.
[136:34.85]He's just waiting for that to happen.
[136:37.03]For the opportunity where he can say that.
[136:42.72]Alright, you got me.
[136:43.32]There never was a sixth book.
[136:51.36]I need this.
[136:53.39]Come on.
[136:57.17]But I'm a huge fan of that series.
[136:59.23]I've read all those books.
[137:00.73]Watched all the show.
[137:02.71]I'm a huge fan of A Song of Ice and Fire.
[137:04.49]Huge fan.
[137:10.19]So yeah, it does suck a little when the Dance of Dragons comes out and then like five fucking years goes by and the guy's just like, yeah, it's coming.
[137:19.65]I feel like me.
[137:23.01]I'm working on my book.
[137:24.71]But here's the difference.
[137:26.49]He actually is like a writer.
[137:29.47]This is what he does, you know?
[137:32.05]I like blew my nose into a piece of paper and like called it a book.
[137:35.17]You know, that's different.
[137:36.94]I'm not a writer.
[137:43.74]I never claimed to be a writer.
[137:58.60]I want to get to five kills.
[137:59.78]Can I please get to a five kill streak?
[138:01.48]Can that happen?
[138:05.68]It did.
[138:06.22]It finally happened after like three years.
[138:08.60]I only got to six, whatever.
[138:21.11]No, no free.
[138:22.23]I lost my sponsorship.
[138:29.40]If I was ghostwriting the next book for Game of Thrones, I would be in a lot of trouble.
[138:41.01]It would not be a good thing.
[138:43.59]Hello.
[138:51.05]Too many of you.
[138:52.85]Too many!
[138:56.64]I'm creeping up on second place.
[139:00.09]There's got to be good enough.
[139:00.85]Opinion on Westworld.
[139:09.68]Loved it.
[139:13.08]Here's the problem with Westworld, though, and shows like that, and this is like the culture that we live in now.
[139:18.64]I'm going to call it the let's figure out what the plot of the show is culture.
[139:27.29]because you know like years ago if you wanted to if you're watching a show like I'm not going to say any spoilers and please do not please refrain from saying any spoilers don't do that but like 10 years ago if you were watching a TV show you would be talking to like your friends and your family about it and you'd be like I wonder what's gonna happen with this guy
[139:48.84]The internet culture has created a world where people can go to communities and figure out the whole story.
[139:56.56]And then people like me go to those sites because I'm so hungry for information because I'm so into the show that I end up reading people's incredibly detailed theories that end up just being the plot of the whole show.
[140:16.66]That's like the world we live in right now.
[140:18.98]Westworld is an incredible show.
[140:20.68]But because I was so into it, I was looking at theories online for like four hours a night.
[140:25.53]And people figured out the entire plotline of the whole show.
[140:29.55]So I knew what was going on.
[140:37.31]The last four episodes of this season of Westworld, I knew what was happening.
[140:42.10]I knew it.
[140:43.52]Because of all the theories.
[140:48.64]People are just fucking smart, and they're able to work together with a whole community of other people that also are smart.
[140:55.89]So I gave myself a new... Ever since doing that, I have a new rule.
[141:00.09]Where... What the fuck was that?
[141:06.33]My new rule is if I'm really into a show, and it's a mysterious plot twisty show, just stay the fuck away from like Reddit.
[141:16.20]Because I will know what the plot of the whole entire show is if I do that.
[141:20.48]So, I'm gonna not do that anymore.
[141:31.41]Ow.
[141:34.54]Friendly fire.
[141:35.14]Friendly fire is on.
[141:35.78]No, it isn't.
[141:36.12]Hold on.
[141:39.58]Can't hurt each other.
[141:48.41]Play Splatoon.
[141:49.23]I've played Splatoon before.
[141:50.27]It was good.
[141:53.10]I didn't really like the control scheme, so I didn't continue playing it, but it was a cute, fun game.
[142:05.94]Alright, what'd you get?
[142:13.36]Ow.
[142:14.04]Oh, he's in the boat.
[142:16.18]He's on a boat.
[142:20.47]Play Starter Valley again?
[142:21.31]I will.
[142:22.75]I'm waiting for the potential cooperative update.
[142:28.07]Because me and Etalyx were talking about if that game got co-op, then we could play it and have fun and stream it and
[142:36.45]So, Metallix and I will be playing that game when Co-op does come out for it eventually.
[142:42.69]Whenever that is, I don't know.
[142:45.97]But that'd have to be a substantial enough update for me to want to play it again.
[142:50.21]Because I streamed and played that game a lot.
[142:55.24]I have like 40 hours in that game on stream.
[142:58.82]So, there would need to be enough material for me to want to stream it again.
[143:04.11]And co-op is enough material for sure to stream the game again.
[143:14.63]Am I gonna get a switch?
[143:15.35]Yes.
[143:18.29]I am definitely getting a switch.
[143:29.68]Yep.
[143:31.92]Oh, okay.
[143:32.54]I gotta turn it on here.
[143:33.28]I gotta get to second place.
[143:35.64]Second place, come on.
[143:39.00]I need like four more kills in a row.
[143:40.90]I need a good string.
[143:42.50]And I will get to second place.
[143:45.07]Like this guy.
[143:45.53]This guy's not gonna be paying attention because he's gonna be tunnel visioned right now.
[143:48.31]Perfect.
[143:51.59]Shit.
[143:52.23]And I didn't know he was here.
[143:55.39]Damn it.
[144:04.02]Be a distraction for long enough for me to open this.
[144:05.76]Come on, guys.
[144:06.44]Come on.
[144:06.96]Anybody get what just happened there?
[144:17.36]I shot that guy like fucking four times in the chest.
[144:33.89]Give me that shotgun.
[144:35.23]I'm not going to get second place.
[144:36.25]I have like two minutes.
[144:36.95]It's not going to happen.
[144:44.79]That was a waste of five shots, four shots.
[144:49.63]Thank you for the subs, guys.
[144:50.51]Everybody that's been subbing this stream, thank you so much.
[144:55.43]You guys fucking rock.
[144:57.92]Those of you that missed the last stream where I talked about it, I guess I'll talk about it again, because why not?
[145:07.29]So I'm changing the way that I acknowledge subscriptions.
[145:13.31]Just because of how it's been much harder lately for me to pay attention to them.
[145:20.17]Because I get focused in a game and sometimes like 10, 15 subs will go by and I'll just be so locked into a game or in a conversation that I'll miss them.
[145:28.91]So I'm going to try to figure out a solution to it.
[145:31.26]Because I don't want people to feel like they're not being acknowledged for supporting the stream, obviously.
[145:37.10]Because I very much appreciate it, and I think you guys are fucking awesome.
[145:40.02]And if anyone ever decided to give me any amount of money ever, especially if it was a concurrently reoccurring one, then of course I would acknowledge it.
[145:52.24]But it's getting harder to do.
[145:55.18]So I need to figure out some type of solution for it.
[145:58.75]While I just take care of these two at the same time, you know what I mean?
[146:09.22]No, I think he's out of reach at this point.
[146:13.50]One minute.
[146:14.64]Can I do it?
[146:15.04]I need 10 points in one minute.
[146:16.88]Let's go.
[146:23.24]Let's see if I can do it.
[146:29.47]Oh, there has to be enemies for me to do it.
[146:39.66]Ooh, I did it!
[146:40.20]I gotta stay in second place.
[146:42.08]Ooh!
[146:42.18]Hey!
[146:42.28]I did it.
[147:04.76]Has anyone ever recognized me in real life?
[147:06.86]Yes.
[147:07.98]It's actually happened a lot more frequently lately for some reason.
[147:11.04]I don't know why.
[147:14.80]It's happened like three times in the last like 60 days.
[147:19.58]Strangely enough, it doesn't happen that often, but yeah, it does.
[147:21.62]There we go.
[147:25.61]What do we got for a time?
[147:27.93]I'm fucking hungry.
[147:29.03]My stomach is killing me.
[147:31.68]You know what you get when you're kind of sick?
[147:34.14]And you're starving, but you have a stomach ache?
[147:38.77]That's the worst thing.
[147:39.59]Because you so badly want to eat food, but at the same time, you realize that it will hurt.
[147:49.07]But I think I'm gonna try to eat something.
[147:52.38]And just relax a little bit.
[147:54.28]My, like, lower core is just not feeling so great at the moment for some reason.
[147:58.02]I don't know why.
[148:04.44]The facecam is the HP bar.
[148:09.19]Yeah, I think I'm gonna go lie down and relax.
[148:13.19]That's this, like, wicked obnoxious lower back stomach pain.
[148:19.20]They're both connected.
[148:22.56]Somehow, I don't know why, but it's starting to bother me a little more than it was like an hour or two ago.
[148:29.76]But regardless, just wanted to chill for a couple hours.
[148:33.44]I didn't really have a plan today, but this weekend on Friday, Thursday, we'll be doing the DLC for Resident Evil 7 in VR.
[148:41.32]So hopefully that's fun.
[148:42.90]And we'll move on from that if it doesn't take that long.
[148:46.00]We will do something else.
[148:47.93]Maybe I'll try.
[148:48.81]Is there anything else for PSVR that's cool?
[148:53.02]I'll look into that.
[148:53.82]Maybe we'll do another VR stream.
[148:55.32]Just like find some cool things.
[148:58.82]But besides that, Friday is going to be a movie stream and it's going to be a prepared stream.
[149:03.53]So that means that there's going to be stuff there that I'm going to have to work on off stream and it'll be hopefully funny.
[149:10.87]And if not, then I tried.
[149:13.97]But, goodnight guys.
[149:16.00]Thank you everybody for sticking around.
[149:19.96]All you guys that subscribed, all the people that gave bits tonight, you guys rock.
[149:23.60]Hopefully you had a good time.
[149:25.95]And have a good rest of your evening.
[149:27.23]I'm gonna go try to figure out what's wrong with my tummy.
[149:30.87]And goodnight.
[150:00.47]you
[150:35.34]you
