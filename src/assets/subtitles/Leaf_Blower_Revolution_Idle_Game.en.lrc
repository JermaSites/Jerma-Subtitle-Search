[00:00.81]What's up?
[00:01.05]How you doing?
[00:05.41]Late?
[00:05.69]I know.
[00:06.23]Yeah, by five, by just five mini minutes, okay?
[00:11.31]Five mini minutes.
[00:16.57]I think within five minutes is fine.
[00:19.31]Don't you agree?
[00:21.29]Look, they cancel your doctor's appointment within 15, right?
[00:24.50]After 15.
[00:25.14]So if you get to your doctor's appointment 14 minutes late, they still take you.
[00:32.11]I'm here five.
[00:36.91]And then, hey, and then you got to wait 40 for the doctor, right?
[00:40.45]You know what I mean?
[00:41.49]How you guys doing?
[00:51.84]I wanted to pop in.
[00:53.02]I know I told you guys last week that the next few weeks are going to be really tight schedule wise.
[00:59.80]A lot of stuff going on.
[01:01.50]But I did not want to just disappear.
[01:03.16]I did want to hang out and have like a chill stream and hang out with you guys for a while.
[01:08.08]You know, you've been calling me Delay Daryl.
[01:10.62]Delay Danny.
[01:11.66]Over the last few months.
[01:14.52]You're going to have a new name for me.
[01:15.56]It's going to be Announcement Andrew.
[01:17.22]I'm going to have like three things to talk about.
[01:20.56]I'm going to be Announcement Andy.
[01:24.18]Like in a few weeks.
[01:29.10]Delay Dongus.
[01:35.28]Play Halo 3 with me.
[01:37.98]Like right now?
[01:38.54]You want to play Halo 3 with you right now?
[01:44.47]Not right now.
[01:46.73]No.
[01:47.67]Look, I don't want to say no, but I can't.
[01:49.99]I don't even like... I don't play Halo.
[01:53.02]Why am I responding to this?
[01:59.45]No, I'm sorry.
[02:00.01]I'm not going to play Halo 3 with you.
[02:02.42]Not right now.
[02:04.32]Look, just be honest.
[02:05.32]I'm going to be honest.
[02:06.26]I'm probably not going to play Halo 3 with you.
[02:08.52]He's so high.
[02:09.62]No, I am not.
[02:11.02]I've just got a T here.
[02:17.97]So today we're going to do... Sorry.
[02:20.73]Today we're going to do a couple of interesting things.
[02:24.69]We're going to play a game that I've been wanting to play.
[02:26.73]It's been on a bunch of polls and it keeps getting vetoed.
[02:31.59]How dare that happen?
[02:33.45]We're going to play Leaf Blower Revolution.
[02:35.35]Just a chill game.
[02:35.97]We're going to hang out.
[02:36.55]We're going to see lots of ResidentSleepers tonight.
[02:38.20]That's fine.
[02:40.42]God, that tea was so hot.
[02:41.72]It just changed my voice.
[02:48.22]But we're also going to do something today that I've been kind of sitting in the back pocket for a long time.
[02:54.17]We're going to go over the Jerma Census that was taking place earlier this past year.
[03:01.20]I'm not sure a lot of you have seen it.
[03:02.96]It's very interesting.
[03:05.62]Finally.
[03:06.56]Yeah.
[03:09.16]So we'll go over that.
[03:11.75]It's pretty elaborate.
[03:15.43]The 2020, yeah, we're going to go for the 2020 census in 2021.
[03:17.95]Come on, I'm a John Madden game.
[03:24.03]No, wait, it would be the reverse, wouldn't it?
[03:26.43]It would be the 2021 census in 2021.
[03:28.67]Yeah, I fucked it up.
[03:29.65]It was the other way around.
[03:31.88]Reverse Madden.
[03:37.96]Catboy waiting room.
[03:39.40]Yeah, well, you're going to have to just hold on.
[03:47.46]Just let me do that the way that I want to do it.
[03:50.40]Please.
[03:51.10]Thank you.
[03:51.77]And thank you also.
[03:52.73]And thank you.
[03:53.15]And please again.
[03:58.07]I did that as a joke to make like a funny slurp sound.
[04:00.61]And the tea went underneath my tongue and hit behind my back bottom teeth and hurt.
[04:06.78]This is so hot.
[04:08.66]And I go, that was so funny though, right?
[04:10.72]It was so funny to go like, but the way that I moved my mouth, I just burnt underneath my tongue behind my back teeth on the bottom.
[04:17.31]Nice.
[04:19.19]It was wicked funny though.
[04:20.17]Everybody thought it was fucking and everybody laughed at it.
[04:21.83]Alright, let's go.
[04:28.48]Leaf Blower Simulator.
[04:31.20]I keep saying Leaf Blower Simulator, but that's not what this is.
[04:35.45]Thank you, Slimes, for the five community subs.
[04:38.19]You got Slime in your name.
[04:39.35]You are automatically a family member in the Slime family.

[04:48.80]Which, I mean, what is this, Jeremiah?
[04:54.50]What?
[04:55.81]I told you I wanted to play this.
[04:57.59]I told you I wanted to play this.
[05:00.15]We went over this like a million times.
[05:02.51]How many times have you guys been in the pre-stream chat and I was like, I'm going to play Leaf Blower Idol game.
[05:06.27]And people were like, oh man, don't play that.
[05:08.07]That game sucks.
[05:10.71]And I'm like, I'm going to play it at one point.
[05:12.40]I'm going to play it.
[05:14.92]This has happened like 10 times over the last two or three months.

[05:48.39]It's winter.
[05:50.57]It's not even the fall, Jeremy.
[05:51.88]It's wintertime.
[05:52.64]Why would there be leaves on the ground?
[05:57.18]The game.
[05:59.58]Oh, alright.
[06:01.31]Ding, ding, ding, ding.

[06:37.31]I'm just sprinting and the wind that I'm making from running is getting rid of this.
[06:48.26]This is epic.
[06:51.04]What is this thing?
[06:52.52]Gold leaves, trees.
[06:53.88]Okay, this music has to go.

[07:42.64]Hold on.
[07:45.54]What should I put on?
[07:47.46]How about the one that goes... Put on the Flintstones.

[08:02.87]Get a rake.
[08:04.47]Pushing away leaves with a rake.

[08:36.43]This is epic.
[08:37.91]You just wait.

[08:42.82]I don't want to tell you guys about it, but, man, you guys have no idea.
[08:49.10]It's like a leaf blower again.
[08:53.22]No, there are bodies buried here.
[08:54.42]There are bodies buried here.
[08:57.13]And slowly, as he cleans up the leaves, some of the bodies are going to get exposed.
[09:01.35]And there's going to be skeletons and, like, dead decomposing bodies and coffins and shit in here.
[09:05.64]And this is a guy's backyard, and he's a fucking serial killer.
[09:08.56]There.

[10:27.05]I like it.
[10:31.32]How do I make the leaves produce more... How do I make the leaves produce more trees?
[10:34.82]How do I make the trees... How do I make the trees drop more leaves on the ground for me to rake?
[10:38.47]That's important.

[11:04.34]I like that.
[11:05.06]That feels pretty good.
[11:11.76]Yes, I am very well aware that this looks like one of those mobile on your iPhone ads.
[11:21.47]Where the ad forces you to play the game for five seconds before you're allowed to hit the X in the corner.
[11:34.82]It's always really laggy too.
[11:38.18]How do they even do that?
[11:40.56]Why do they even do that?

[13:34.66]And they've been coming out like every two years.
[13:35.94]And they're fantastic.

[14:40.61]And I couldn't find the diner or whatever.
[14:45.18]And I was surrounded by mist.
[14:47.98]I was like, this game sucks.

[16:38.24]There are 10,000 people watching this man clean up leaves.
[16:43.64]Look, it's the experience.
[16:46.23]Right now, you probably looked outside and you were like, I still haven't done it.
[16:50.33]There are probably a bunch of old leaves on the ground that you didn't do since November.
[16:57.87]You just shut the window closed and you go, nah, I'll just watch him do it instead.
[17:06.60]Break your leaves all the way into January.
[17:08.35]What would even happen?
[17:11.57]There's snow.
[17:14.41]It just decomposed.
[17:20.73]Oh, that would be bad.
[17:22.71]There's snow on the ground.
[17:26.03]But don't you understand?
[17:26.82]I've wanted to play this game since like September or October of this past year.
[17:32.74]Why would I have wanted to play Leaf Blowing Simulator now?
[17:36.65]No, I'm catching up with what I wanted to do four months ago.
[17:40.89]Otherwise, what?
[17:41.31]I've got to wait another year to play this?
[17:46.30]No.
[17:47.06]You're going to sit down and you're going to listen to me play this game.
[17:51.88]Hold on.
[17:52.44]I've got to get this off.
[17:53.30]This OST.
[17:54.24]This OST is making me nuts.
[17:55.82]It's making me crazy.
[17:56.93]I've got to turn this off.
[18:02.42]Let's skip halfway in.
[18:07.96]I don't like this.
[18:08.68]I want something else.
[18:09.52]Give me something else.
[18:10.10]It's too much for me.
[18:15.27]I don't want to have Pyramid Head chasing you down a hallway for an hour and a half.
[18:19.55]I don't know.
[18:22.41]Put on Herbs?
[18:26.16]U-R-B-A Herbs?
[18:27.66]What's Herbs?
[18:28.06]Herbs.
[18:32.90]Hotline Miami, that's a good one.
[18:34.36]I'll do that one.
[18:42.10]Yep.
[18:43.16]Oh, yeah.
[18:43.82]Yeah, this is like a 9.4.
[18:45.48]The reason why it's not a 10 is because I fucking hate it every second of this game.
[18:52.40]Wait, no, no, no.
[18:52.82]Hotline Miami 2 is the one, right?
[18:58.67]Look at that.
[18:59.11]Look at that.
[18:59.51]Look at that.
[18:59.93]Look at that.
[19:00.33]Look at that.
[19:03.72]No, Hotline Miami 2 is the one that I didn't like.
[19:05.68]I liked Hotline Miami 1.
[19:06.79]I liked Hotline Miami 2 though.
[19:08.45]I just hated it.
[19:10.33]You guys get it.
[19:10.89]We're all gamers here.
[19:14.37]Alright.
[19:15.41]Let's get more trees.

[19:17.75]No, I was supposed to get a leaf blower.
[19:18.90]Whatever.
[19:19.16]I got plenty of time.
[19:26.32]Oh, it feels so good.
[19:28.12]It feels like I'm just like shaving.
[19:32.98]You guys ever shave in the mirror and you have a ton of hair and you get that one clean line and you just go, oh.
[19:38.73]You know.
[19:48.10]Have none of you guys have ever shaved before?
[19:51.50]You don't know what it's like to get like the clean line of like a. Oh.
[19:59.23]I don't understand.
[20:00.43]I don't shave.
[20:00.93]I let it grow.
[20:01.57]Yeah, but you have to have shaved at least once in your life.
[20:06.43]I'm 12.
[20:06.67]We're 12.
[20:11.64]No, you're not.
[20:12.56]You know why I know that?
[20:13.42]Because I've got the goddamn census right in front of me.
[20:16.62]You're 12.
[20:17.40]Are you?
[20:17.90]Well, that's interesting.
[20:18.54]We'll find out.
[20:18.98]Because I've got the census in front of me.
[20:21.54]I can see exactly how old you are.
[20:27.86]I gotta get to 5k.
[20:34.02]We lied on the census.
[20:35.80]That's illegal.
[20:36.58]So, no, you didn't.
[20:46.23]Prove it.
[20:46.75]But is that not illegal?
[20:49.23]I mean, it's illegal.
[20:51.95]Are there people that like take the census and say that like 400 people live in their house?
[20:56.71]That's illegal.
[21:03.42]Do you go to jail for that?
[21:07.59]I don't think you're a court date.
[21:09.45]The judge is proceeding.
[21:11.95]Now, Mr. Elbertson, it says here that you said on your census that 250,000 people lived in your residence.
[21:19.71]Is that correct?
[21:21.63]That's correct, Your Honor.
[21:24.79]Now, why did you think that was so funny to mess with the census?
[21:29.55]Very important thing, the census.
[21:35.06]We need to keep track of all consciousness.
[21:36.58]You know what that does?
[21:37.48]You know what that makes us so we can determine where the tax dollars go?
[21:40.18]That's what it's for.
[21:42.69]I'm sorry, I'll never do it again.
[21:44.17]That's right, you'll never do it again.
[21:47.35]Because you're going to spend 24 months in prison.
[21:51.05]I'm sorry, doctor.
[21:52.05]I'm sorry, Dr. Phil, I'll never do it again.
[21:56.51]That's right.

[23:26.96]What's going on, Kit?
[23:32.80]Kit Boga.
[23:34.64]Resident funny man on the internet.

[23:53.83]It means nothing.
[23:55.23]Wait, what?
[23:56.47]Hold on.
[23:58.87]The Jerma985 guarantee means nothing?

[24:07.55]Gotta get the leaf blower.
[24:08.55]Hold on.
[24:08.85]Let me get the leaf blower.
[24:10.50]Leaf blower.
[24:11.02]This is fun.
[24:12.74]Oh, man.
[24:13.46]Look at this.
[24:13.88]Oh, man.
[24:17.76]I need extra spawning.
[24:23.42]Oh, thanks for the, uh, thanks for the raid.
[24:24.62]Welcome, guys.
[24:25.72]We're playing Leaf Blower Simulator.
[24:27.24]That's not what the name, the game's called Leaf Blower Revolution.
[24:30.79]Just, um, we're just chilling today.
[24:32.11]We're just having a chill stream.
[24:34.59]You know, nothing weird's gonna happen today.
[24:36.39]This is just leaf blowing, collecting apples, and just hanging out with you.
[24:42.15]Thanks for being here.
[24:44.60]We had another raid, too.
[24:45.32]We had Nice Beaver.
[24:47.90]A few hundred people came in from Nice Beaver.
[24:51.87]Thanks for the raid.
[24:55.81]Where's the cat boy?
[24:56.66]Hope you had a good stream.
[25:03.98]3,000 people are gone.
[25:06.88]You guys know how to raid works?
[25:10.08]Alright, let me ask you a question.
[25:11.80]Everyone's saying 3K people left.
[25:13.38]Let me ask you a question.
[25:14.60]So when we raid somebody... Here we go.
[25:18.71]Here comes the census.
[25:20.31]When we raid somebody...
[25:22.57]How long do you stay there for after the raid?
[25:27.05]Tell me.
[25:29.96]Five minutes, 10 minutes, an hour, a few hours.
[25:33.76]No one's obligated to stay here and watch me.
[25:37.46]They just consumed probably an awesome kitboga stream.
[25:42.22]You know, maybe you got to get stuff to do.
[25:43.74]You come in and say hello, jump into another stream and raid, and then you got stuff to do.
[25:47.65]You're like, alright, I'm going to take a break.
[26:00.27]Mmm, yummy stream.
[26:01.43]Hey, Seb.
[26:04.54]Sebberino, thanks for the five subs.
[26:05.94]Community subs.
[26:06.56]Thank you, Seb.
[26:10.66]How long is this song?
[26:14.48]Is this like the 10-hour version of the first song?
[26:20.38]There we go.
[26:20.74]Alright, that's... There we go.
[26:24.40]I feel like I'm playing Hotline Miami.
[26:25.82]Don't you think so?
[26:28.14]Can you imagine like three guys coming down here and it's like... Next area.
[26:40.12]Hotline Miami is such a weird game.
[26:41.20]I always feel like I want to play it again.
[26:42.36]Because it's so much fun to play it.
[26:45.69]But I've gone back to it once or twice, I think.
[26:49.65]And you just instantly die like five times in a row in the first few levels.
[26:52.31]And you're like, nah, I forgot.
[26:53.39]I don't want to do this ever again.
[27:03.72]Do a freestyle rap.
[27:07.02]Alright, okay.
[27:12.38]The leaves have fallen.
[27:13.44]It's time for fall.
[27:14.58]It's having a ball.
[27:15.76]I'm going off the wall.
[27:17.02]I'm seeing you.
[27:17.68]I'm seeing you with my two eyes.
[27:19.54]Burning you through those, those, those thighs.
[27:23.76]And then, whatever.
[27:38.54]That was fucking awful.
[27:42.82]I don't know, what do you want me to say?
[27:44.70]I try to find a word.
[27:52.29]Don't ever do that again.
[27:56.73]Alright, what do we got?
[28:02.01]Upgrades 500.
[28:02.45]Wait, where's my golden leaves?
[28:09.94]Where's the golden leaf currency?
[28:13.53]Holy shit, there's so much.
[28:14.45]Alright, where's the golden leaf?
[28:15.93]Trees can drop golden leaves.
[28:17.11]I need 10,000.
[28:21.17]One leaf per level?
[28:23.50]This is expensive.
[28:25.02]One leaf per level by using advanced marketing techniques.
[28:28.16]Holy shit, that's two.
[28:29.50]That's +2.
[28:30.12]That's +2.
[28:30.58]That's all +2.
[28:41.67]I need more spawn.
[28:46.44]I need more spawn.
[28:48.72]More spawn.
[28:49.58]More.
[28:55.14]Buy, buy.
[28:55.71]More marketing.
[28:56.07]Alright, I'm going to save it for marketing three.
[28:57.55]I need to take a sip since I burnt my mouth.
[29:09.15]Here's the ultimate test, bro.
[29:10.03]You guys said that you would sit here and watch me, like, paint a fence or something.
[29:15.38]I mean, you're struggling right now.
[29:16.96]Hovering over the X button.
[29:18.50]Just trying to find a reason to leave.
[29:20.44]Like you said in chat a year ago.
[29:22.88]I would watch you paint a fence.
[29:24.89]I would watch you do anything.
[29:25.79]I would watch you just sit and stare at a wall.
[29:27.79]Would you?
[29:28.79]Hovering over the fucking X button.
[29:31.01]Remembering the promise you made to me.
[29:34.41]Are you going to keep your promise?
[29:36.65]Or are you going to be a liar?
[29:38.63]We'll find out.
[29:43.12]We'll find out if you actually do what you said you were going to do.
[29:45.60]I'm just really glad that you heard.
[29:54.42]Ah, they clicked it.
[29:55.30]They clicked it.
[30:04.24]How much is it?
[30:07.05]Alright, it's 12,000.
[30:08.82]I'm going to do it again.
[30:17.18]Will you succumb to the boredom?
[30:18.86]Will you succumb to it, or will you click that X?
[30:22.02]You won't click that X. You won't click that X. You won't click that X. No, no, no, no, wait.
[30:28.26]Is it Jedi mind trick?
[30:28.96]They tell you to do it, and you don't do it?
[30:31.10]You will click that X. No, don't click it, though.
[30:33.10]Does that work on you?
[30:33.96]What's the Jedi mind trick one?
[30:35.40]You wave your hand around, and you say it, right?
[30:40.86]You will.
[30:41.80]You will shoot me in the chest.
[30:44.39]Shooting in chest.
[30:45.07]Roger.
[30:46.09]Hey!
[30:50.93]Or it's a gas light.
[30:51.87]Oh no, not another robot chicken joke.
[31:10.69]Obi-Wan's at the fucking grocery store and like his coupon expired.
[31:15.82]Sorry, Mr. Kenobi, this coupon expired.
[31:18.38]You will give me another day on that 25% off laundry detergent coupon.
[31:23.70]I will give you that 25% coupon.
[31:26.29]Yes!
[31:37.47]Oh no, he'd probably go, Jedi mind trick!
[31:40.53]Yes!
[31:49.37]Ban that guy.
[31:50.39]Me?
[31:50.61]What's wrong with me?
[31:57.03]How come every robot chicken reference that we've ever made has been about a Star Wars routine that they do?
[32:02.23]Probably because that's what they do.
[32:05.74]It's either like Thundercats, Star Wars, or like the Hulk.
[32:11.56]It's like every single joke they've ever made.
[32:13.14]How does Mike?
[32:21.42]What?
[32:21.78]What did I say?
[32:22.54]It's whatever action figure they can get on sale.
[32:26.22]Alright, I need 12k, right?
[32:32.35]I need more leaves.
[32:33.35]This is bullshit.
[32:41.13]You cracked the code after 15 years.
[32:43.07]Family Guy, Star Wars.
[32:53.58]Hey, you guys still make Peter Griffin references all the time.
[32:56.62]I'm not sure what's happening with Family Guy right now, but...
[33:03.06]So Family Guy is, like, not funny anymore.
[33:05.80]Right?
[33:06.28]Like, I don't think it is.
[33:08.02]But people, it, like, it was funny for, like, five or six seasons.
[33:13.58]And then it got, like, canned.
[33:15.04]They brought it back.
[33:15.72]It was alright for a while.
[33:16.78]And then everybody hated it.
[33:18.64]And now nobody cares about the show.
[33:20.78]They just like to meme the characters on the show.
[33:26.69]Like, I see Peter Griffin fucking everywhere.
[33:29.39]Everywhere.
[33:30.05]Everywhere.
[33:31.19]But you don't, nobody watches that show.
[33:33.85]I've seen like the holy crap Lois.
[33:35.78]People are using Peter Griffin and like Stewie and stuff.
[33:39.26]But the show doesn't even matter to them.
[33:43.26]It's weird, isn't it?
[33:52.42]Yeah, he's doing what?
[33:55.16]You are describing yourself.
[33:58.20]Yeah, of what?
[33:58.90]So?
[34:01.88]Are you sure?
[34:02.40]But people like, alright, but wait a minute.
[34:08.50]Is this a scenario?
[34:09.34]Okay.
[34:09.70]Are you telling me to like put milk up my nose in the cafeteria?
[34:12.18]Not because you like want to watch me put milk up my nose, but you think I'm going to do it.
[34:15.38]And it's funny that I will actually put the milk up my nose.
[34:18.06]You don't actually care that I'm doing the milk up the nose.
[34:20.03]You just know that I'm going to do it.
[34:20.97]And I'm going to be like, holy shit.
[34:21.93]The guy put fucking milk up his nose.
[34:24.37]You don't actually care about the milk going into my nose.
[34:26.05]You just like a shock that I'm going to do it in the first place.
[34:30.17]Really?
[34:31.35]Okay.
[34:41.24]Excuses.
[34:45.69]Alright, I need 12,000 and then I'm going to move on to a new weapon.
[34:50.93]CatboyStream, you need to lap up milk.
[34:53.35]Let me tell you something.
[34:54.85]If you think for a second that it's just going to be me with fucking cat ears on.
[34:58.76]If you think I'm just going to have cat ears on and like eye makeup on, you are so wrong.
[35:05.20]It's insulting.
[35:08.60]Just wait.
[35:12.36]Just you wait.
[35:13.56]You'll see.
[35:21.00]MonkaS.
[35:25.92]Alright, 12,000.
[35:26.34]I'm almost there.
[35:27.44]Maybe I should try horizontal.
[35:33.74]Yep.
[35:37.07]That's cleaner to me, I think.
[35:37.99]What do you think?
[35:38.71]Is that cleaner to you?
[35:43.28]Alright, 12,000.
[35:44.42]Here we go.
[35:46.19]Leaf marketing.
[35:47.05]Level 3.
[35:48.11]Oh, that's a lot of money.
[35:48.97]Alright, now I have plus 4.
[35:50.15]Let's go.
[35:50.45]Now I'm gonna get the leaves spawning here.
[35:52.37]How much is a... I need golden leaves to spawn.
[35:55.79]50 subs if you drink milk out of your nose.
[36:03.28]No, I'm not like... I'm not like 10.
[36:05.48]Okay.
[36:06.36]Okay.
[36:11.39]No, that's not.
[36:12.67]I don't want to do that.
[36:16.69]I'm not going to drink milk through my nose.
[36:24.84]No, that's not happening.
[36:25.78]I'm sorry.
[36:26.74]If you think you're going to get a guy drinking milk out of his nose today.
[36:31.34]No, I'd rather piss my pants on stream.
[36:35.53]If you have that on the scale of things you would... embarrassing things.
[36:38.39]Oh, my God.
[36:38.99]Things you'd that... Oh, but look at how crazy.
[36:40.39]There was so much hurt.
[36:42.45]I would rather stand up and just pee into a pair of jeans than snort milk in my nose on stream.
[36:50.10]I'm serious.
[36:50.78]I really mean that.
[36:58.47]Two billion off the debt.
[37:02.25]Yeah, there won't be a debt anymore.
[37:04.88]Won't be a channel anymore.
[37:05.89]Hey, if I get like permanently banned on Twitch, that means like the debt goes away too, right?
[37:15.51]Like I can't pay it back.
[37:18.04]I'm going to like streamer prison.
[37:23.00]I mean, no.
[37:28.70]If I go to like streamer, like banned streamer Twitch prison, how am I going to pay you back?
[37:32.94]I'm literally in prison.
[37:34.04]What are you talking about?
[37:37.16]We will find you.
[37:37.88]Yeah, I'm in prison.
[37:38.91]You can come like visit and I'll pick the phone up and you pick the phone up and you can just say like, L-U-L activated and hang up.
[37:47.39]Like I don't have to pay you.
[37:54.05]Oh, that was a good line right there.
[38:01.02]Alright, let's go.
[38:01.84]I got to claim some of this stuff.
[38:02.62]What do we got?
[38:04.16]Healthy fruits.
[38:09.29]I want to hit claim all, but I want to see what I'm getting.
[38:10.99]You guys like that?
[38:12.97]Whatever.
[38:13.23]Alright.
[38:16.35]I need 500.
[38:19.85]Golden leaves.

[38:24.92]Oh, now I have that currency.
[38:26.42]Shit.
[38:26.74]Okay.
[38:27.30]How often does it drop?
[38:32.40]Not that often.
[38:33.60]Can I make them spawn faster?
[38:38.36]I didn't read it.
[38:39.34]This is a huge spam and I missed it.
[38:40.91]I don't know what I said.
[38:41.63]This is your lawyer speaking.
[38:43.71]I need you to whatever it says.
[38:44.59]Hi, Jeremy.
[38:48.37]This is your lawyer speaking.
[38:49.29]I need you to pay me the fee in kisses this time.
[38:51.42]I saw your stream on Thursday and it's being deleted.
[38:53.74]So I'm not going to read it.
[39:07.88]It's being deleted as fast as I can read it.
[39:09.94]That's so funny.
[39:13.88]No.
[39:25.55]New upgrade menu?
[39:27.11]Where?
[39:28.59]Oh, my God.
[39:29.39]There's a new upgrade menu.

[39:46.90]Poggers.
[39:48.58]Poggers.
[39:50.86]Poggers.
[39:51.92]Poggers.
[39:52.96]There it is.
[39:53.34]Does Chuck E. Cheese even still stream?
[40:03.17]Or did he do that for like a week when Fall Guys was popular?
[40:13.58]He quit because of you.
[40:14.74]Alright, new OST we got.
[40:21.02]Let's see some.
[40:25.80]Okay, I can do spawns more leaves.
[40:29.35]Oh, wait.

[49:23.95]That's gotta be at least a 75% wipe.
[49:26.40]Or that's not happening.
[49:36.41]Haven't people already done that, too?
[49:40.67]I know of at least, like, three or four, like, at least two or three streamers that have done exactly what you were describing.
[49:48.41]And then RT did that like very recently, like a month or two ago.
[49:57.04]I love this game.
[50:03.37]He dated chat for free.
[50:05.77]Well, that's the difference between him and I. That's the difference between him and I. You're not going to get anything for free.
[50:18.24]Everything has a cost.
[50:20.90]Everything has a cost.
[50:27.40]It's implying that you're good at it.
[50:28.42]What if you're good at something?
[50:29.16]Never do it.
[50:29.50]I need more leaves.
[50:33.24]This is not enough.
[50:34.54]I need more leaves.
[50:35.78]Not enough.
[50:37.30]Nuclear fuel.
[50:38.44]No.
[50:38.74]No.
[50:48.36]Can I spend some of the gold leaves?
[50:50.38]Wait, how much?
[50:50.80]It's 500 for the next tool, right?
[50:52.30]Can I just save up for the next tool?
[50:54.88]No, no, no.
[50:55.20]I need more leaves.
[50:55.91]No, fuck that.
[50:56.51]Unlock the leaf portal.
[50:58.77]You can restart your leaf blowing to gain coins.
[51:00.91]What?
[51:02.95]Is this prestiging?
[51:04.57]Spawns one more leaf per tree.
[51:06.47]Yeah, let's go.
[51:13.58]Look at that.
[51:15.08]It's filling the screen now.
[51:20.07]Remember, you idiot, the devs in the chat, and you missed it.
[51:22.25]Were they?
[51:24.97]Are they still here?
[51:27.77]Look at the chat.
[51:28.31]Well, I didn't see.
[51:29.63]Where?
[51:29.85]Is it a bait?
[51:36.72]Might be.
[51:37.02]I don't know.
[51:39.66]I don't know.
[51:39.98]It might be a bait.
[51:42.80]Behind you.
[51:44.54]I look behind me.
[51:45.20]Hey, man!
[51:47.22]Hey, what's up?
[51:47.70]Hey, you playing my game?
[51:51.00]The thing is, though, that... Anybody could just say that.
[51:53.62]That could just be, like, a crazed person.
[51:59.32]That could still be somebody pretending to be a dev.
[52:01.61]The whole dev and chat thing, we need some form of, like, dev ID, don't we?
[52:14.68]Twitch should implement a feature where they have another badge.
[52:17.50]If they're actually the game dev and they can prove it, when their game is being played from the directory, they should pop up and chat with a dev badge.
[52:24.55]Why is that not here, Twitch?
[52:25.97]Why have you not implemented that?
[52:27.37]Why is that not a thing you have here?
[52:37.73]You just put me in a clown costume.
[52:39.15]I'll get in there to like a Twitch meeting.
[52:41.07]And I'll give them all these things.
[52:42.61]I want a percentage, though.
[52:44.81]This is not for free.
[52:45.41]It never was.
[52:52.62]I'm not sure I say that in the boardroom.
[52:57.20]And then they say, Mr. Elbertson, you're not getting any fraction of any of these royalties.
[53:01.58]Okay, that's fine.
[53:02.90]That's cool.
[53:03.62]Cool, man.
[53:04.62]That's cool.
[53:05.04]Hey, man, just give me a call if I can get anything, okay?
[53:08.11]Yeah, just give me a call.
[53:09.47]I'll be around.
[53:13.39]You can use any of those.
[53:14.86]Just use them.
[53:15.24]You can use any of them.
[53:17.64]Alright, cool.
[53:18.30]Yep, see ya.
[53:19.44]Thanks for having me.
[53:20.14]Thanks for having me.
[53:20.78]Yeah, call me again if you need me for anything.
[53:23.04]If you just want to like hang out.
[53:24.54]I'll be around.
[53:27.23]I don't like live here, but like I could be here.
[53:28.99]I could like be here.
[53:29.79]Just let me know.
[53:32.33]Then I'll honk the nose like three times.
[53:37.03]And they will never call me again.
[53:39.23]In fact, the door will lock behind me.
[53:51.27]The door will lock behind me.
[53:53.65]And then I will have forgotten something in the boardroom.
[53:57.57]And I have to stand there and I have to text somebody that's still in there.
[54:02.65]Hey, I left my jacket in there.
[54:05.53]And then they all have to go, fuck, he's going to hear the door unlock sound.
[54:10.93]It's not just, oh, yeah, open.
[54:12.17]Here we are.
[54:12.95]He's going to sit.
[54:13.75]He's right there and he's going to hear junk.
[54:17.96]And he's going to know that we locked the fucking door.
[54:28.08]Grab my jacket.
[54:34.35]Toe Jam & Earl is a great soundtrack.
[54:35.71]I didn't even think about that.
[54:36.53]Alright, I got money.
[54:39.74]Where's it going?
[54:40.40]Trees.
[54:40.92]More of them.
[54:42.60]And a third auto leaf blower.
[54:43.94]Is this a Family Guy skit?
[54:52.96]I hope not.
[55:01.33]It is.
[55:01.67]No, it is not.
[55:02.39]It's not.
[55:02.95]That's not.
[55:07.91]we're gonna get to a real weird part of like human history here in the next like couple hundred years when like every conceivable thing that's ever been said every conceivable joke every piece of music every combination of sounds have been done what happens in like two or three hundred years it's never gonna happen are you sure it might
[55:34.78]What happens when every possible joke can be made?
[55:37.84]And every possible song is written?
[55:42.62]Every movie's ever been made?
[55:44.30]How do we entertain ourselves?
[55:48.79]I think we're going back to the gladiator times.
[55:53.33]When every piece of music has ever been written and nothing else can be written again in like a thousand years, we're going back into like, we're going back to the gladiator pits.
[56:12.13]Just listen to old stuff.
[56:13.45]Yeah, you could.
[56:17.81]Or you could watch the new UFC card.
[56:19.91]UFC 1600.
[56:20.47]Where they just give two guys two rakes.
[56:38.06]And and they add like lightsaber sounds over the footage like live And they'll be like two or three ads for like fucking like the new SpongeBob movie That's what we're looking at Jeremy you always reuse jokes we're used to it already
[57:05.99]Yeah, but I made him up.
[57:07.22]But I made him up.
[57:07.98]I made him up.
[57:09.20]You know how difficult it was and how hard it was to sit there and have writer's block and craft over and over again in my head?
[57:18.21]Well, what would that be?
[57:21.19]Like, it was so much thought that went into that.
[57:23.59]It was like to sit there and write down hundreds of pages of scripture.
[57:39.70]I need 500 leaves I need more I need more that's the I'm trying to yell but I'm not trying to actually yell loud like pretend yelling I hate that I'm not doing that anymore you'll never hear that again from me I promise

[61:03.82]I feel like this sounds pretty close to something else.
[61:09.18]It's toxic.
[61:11.36]No, it's not.
[61:13.09]I thought about that for a second, but it's not.
[61:14.59]It is.
[61:24.61]It's not.
[61:24.90]It's not.
[61:28.63]Alright, you guys don't think we're going to get to a point in like 100, 200 years where every song's been written when already you're telling me that all songs are toxic from Britney Spears?
[61:37.89]And that's now.
[61:41.19]Really?
[61:42.37]You don't think in like 500 years that you... There's infinite songs.
[61:53.82]Is there though?
[61:57.44]Yeah, that's what these scientists say about the planets in the solar system, but I can only see a few hundred up there.
[62:06.27]I can only see maybe a few thousand up there.
[62:08.08]And they say there's quadrillions?
[62:10.08]I don't know.
[62:27.73]Yeah, prove, hey, prove to me that we don't live in a dome, okay?

[64:12.50]It's a good movie.
[64:18.08]Why are you playing this?
[64:18.88]Because I wanted to.

[71:38.66]Plus 102.
[71:41.98]Don't heat up leaves.
[71:49.95]What do you guys think the first food that a caveman ate was?
[71:53.33]What do you think it was?
[72:05.89]Is it weird that I'm going to say other cavemen?
[72:17.66]But wait, no, that would imply that they have to, like, get older.
[72:20.30]Okay, so hold on.
[72:22.24]Berries?
[72:22.82]Like, just start eating stuff.
[72:24.18]How do you know what hungry is?
[72:36.14]Like you just have this awful weird stomach feeling and it's like, what's this?
[72:40.94]The first person to ever eat food, like didn't know what that meant.
[72:52.82]Who was the first person?
[72:55.48]Who was the first person?
[73:07.73]Bible logic.
[73:16.01]Who was the first person?
[73:21.21]Well, it was Carl the caveman.
[73:28.48]He decided that today was the day he was going to eat.
[73:30.86]He's going to chew with his teeth.
[73:35.60]Everything he could find.
[73:40.02]Carl the caveman died very shortly after this.
[73:46.15]But Cindy the cavewoman watched what Carl the caveman ate and noticed that he stopped moving after eating this particular rock.
[73:56.77]So she was like, I'm not going to eat that one.
[73:58.43]I'm not going to crunch up that one.
[74:01.63]So she started to eat just random shit until she died.
[74:06.49]And then Steve, caveman Steve, came by and realized that cavewoman Cindy ate a branch that he's not going to eat.
[74:13.79]And he also knows that caveman Carl consumed a couple of rocks that made him stop moving.
[74:20.79]And eventually it got to a point where they figured it out.
[74:33.40]Evolution, pretty much.
[74:36.72]God, can you imagine?
[74:39.90]Can you possibly imagine needing to just take a guess?
[74:44.91]Like, can I even eat this?
[74:52.03]Like, guys, I look at the back of, like, a fucking almond milk, and if it's, like, close to, like, its Best Buy date, I go, I'm not sure about this.
[74:59.14]I'm not sure about this.
[75:02.78]These- these people had to fucking eat just random stuff until they died.
[75:07.19]And then other people just- like, what?
[75:31.32]He's a caveman.
[75:35.47]Caveman Andy.
[75:45.63]And the worst part about this is, like, really think about that.
[75:49.09]Like, water.
[75:50.71]Water is essential to live, and it's essential to life.
[75:54.33]But back, like, hundreds of thousands or millions or whatever it is.
[76:00.44]Even water could have been dangerous.
[76:02.47]It's like, why did he die after drinking that water?
[76:04.89]We drink water?
[76:05.69]We drink this liquid.
[76:07.77]Some water cannot be drank and consumed.
[76:10.90]What?
[76:11.54]How do we keep track of this?
[76:14.40]That water has like fucking bacteria in it.
[76:16.38]It like killed him.
[76:17.42]That water is like salt and it's bad.
[76:19.75]How did they keep track of this?
[76:31.24]It had to have been some big giant caveman notebook that you went to before you went out to go eat food.
[76:39.05]And you just kind of looked at it and been like, okay, green rock, bad.
[76:43.01]Red, orange rock.
[76:45.93]Good.
[76:48.83]Red berry.
[76:51.41]Bad.
[76:52.03]And they probably have a huge list.
[76:56.65]And that's something that you have to borrow.
[76:58.65]You can't remember all that.
[77:05.59]Why are they eating rocks?
[77:09.69]To find out.
[77:18.60]How do animals live?
[77:22.86]Yeah, animals just eat.
[77:24.82]But they had to do that too.
[77:25.88]I need more combos.
[77:31.28]Yeah, I do.
[77:42.31]eight large green bean poop red stay away from green large green bean somebody had to keep track of this
[78:07.50]yeah all of your history books that you read in class are just the evolution of the don't eat the bread rock book that's the first thing they had to write down oh nice
[78:34.35]What about bread?
[78:35.03]They didn't figure that out for like a thousand years He's doing crack rocks A thousand from what?
[78:53.81]I don't know.
[78:54.19]I don't know anything You know as much as I do
[79:00.39]Because there is a part of our human history that we have no idea what the fuck happened.
[79:08.09]Because I have a blurry black and white picture of like my great-great-grandfather with a top hat on.
[79:13.77]I don't know what he ate.
[79:16.23]What do we have for a barometer?
[79:30.71]bro history we know what they yeah we know what our like great great great grandparents looked like maybe but what about their great great great great grandparents it's wild stuff man

[83:57.92]Why?
[84:04.16]Ah, let's wait.
[84:05.08]I'm not gonna do it until it's a ton.
[84:06.54]Stop, stop, stop, stop!

[87:30.26]I felt good.
[87:36.67]Alright.
[87:37.69]Make sure to do some more upgrades.
[87:39.41]I'm going to lose it on a prestige, right?
[87:44.99]I might as well just get as much as I can out of this.
[87:51.08]Based... Based on what, Jeremiah?
[87:56.84]I don't... That's... I know you're making that joke.
[88:06.78]You bought the upgrade.
[88:09.42]Well, I have to activate the upgrade.
[88:12.48]Look at... We can get so many more coins.
[88:14.14]Look at the percentage just ticking up like crazy.

[88:51.64]You need to prestige to get to platinum leaf, so you have to keep that in mind.
[88:54.08]Okay.
[88:55.92]Alright, but look at these coins just ticking the fuck up like crazy.
[88:58.40]I'm not done yet.
[89:00.00]I want those out, I don't know, a lot.
[89:03.32]What do the coins even do?
[89:04.08]I don't know, but I want them.
[89:07.18]I don't even know what they do.
[89:08.12]I don't even care what they do.
[89:09.02]I just want a ton of them.
[89:21.87]This is what it's like having a lawn.
[89:25.30]Uh, yeah.
[89:26.28]Pretty much.
[89:27.24]Pretty much this.
[89:33.64]What is this?
[89:34.62]Act 2 Diablo II?
[89:36.76]It sounds like that.
[89:37.77]I love the Act 2 music.
[89:48.63]Let's go.
[89:49.03]A little more.
[89:51.07]I want a higher multiplier.
[89:53.77]And I want max out the fertilizer and nuclear fuel.
[90:06.98]Put on Naruto?
[90:08.24]Just whip the mouse around.
[90:09.20]No, I don't like that.
[90:10.76]I don't like that.
[90:11.20]That hurts my head.
[90:12.00]I'd like to cleanly go through clean lines.
[90:17.11]Like that.
[90:18.07]It's a little slower, but feels much nicer on the front of the brain there.
[90:22.29]Feels so much better.
[90:22.91]Yeah.
[90:26.17]Nuclear.
[90:27.67]Nuclear.
[90:31.86]You know why it's hard?
[90:33.14]I usually say nuclear.
[90:36.92]But... Sometimes it's like nuclear.
[90:41.46]Nuclear.
[90:41.82]Nuclear.
[90:47.79]Sometimes it's fun to say nuclear.
[90:52.98]Are you eating the leaves?
[90:53.84]I think he's just spraying them off to the side.
[90:58.18]Can I get more?
[91:03.54]No.
[91:03.82]Okay, I think it's time.
[91:06.10]How are we looking?
[91:08.70]When that gets to a thousand, I'll do it.
[91:22.93]When that hits 1,000, I'll go.
[91:23.85]Play Hollow Knight?
[91:32.41]No, probably not.
[91:34.24]Sorry.
[91:37.38]I'm sorry.
[91:42.50]What's the OST?
[91:43.10]This is MapleStory.
[91:45.04]2006 GMS edition.
[91:47.74]I'm not sure what that means, but that's what it is.
[91:52.18]Play Dawn of War.
[91:53.86]You mean the good one?
[91:57.05]Dawn of War 1.
[91:57.93]Warhammer 40k Dawn of War.
[91:59.67]The good one?
[92:08.11]That might be fun.
[92:10.07]That's like my favorite RTS ever.
[92:13.28]Dawn of War 2 was good.
[92:14.28]I'm sorry.
[92:14.60]I'm gonna have to disagree.
[92:19.21]I like a lot of units.
[92:21.33]I like base building.
[92:23.65]I like the map.
[92:25.03]No, I didn't like Dawn of War 2.
[92:26.39]I actually didn't like it at all.
[92:28.95]I'm sorry, guys.
[92:29.75]I know some people might be really happy about it, but because we got Dawn of War 2, that's why we got Dawn of War 3 the way we did.
[92:36.66]Keep that in mind.
[92:38.24]Dawn of War 2's existence is the reason why Dawn of War 3 was what the game it became.
[92:52.52]No, it isn't.
[92:52.98]Yeah, it is because they got rid of all the stuff from Dawn of War 1 and they made Dawn of War 2 about more about like commanding a squad and less about like building a base and having like a bunch of units.
[93:03.80]And then they were like, well, what the fuck do we do with Dawn of War 3 now?
[93:07.12]I don't know.
[93:08.24]Let's make Dawn of War 2 again.
[93:12.55]This time worse.
[93:27.05]Gun of War 2 campaign is fun, but everything else sucks.
[93:30.37]I could... Yeah, I could imagine this is probably the case.
[93:35.31]They have such cool characters, too.
[93:36.85]The... The orcs?
[93:40.45]I love the orcs.
[93:42.49]They're such an interesting... Such an interesting group.
[93:48.28]What's the boss?
[93:49.44]The big boss, right?
[93:50.34]What's his name?
[93:52.36]Big boss.
[93:53.80]Big... What's his name?
[93:55.08]Big boss.
[93:55.26]Big boss.
[93:58.37]Gorguts here is Gorguts.
[94:04.48]I'm the boss.
[94:05.50]I'm big boss Gorguts.
[94:07.38]I love Gorguts.
[94:12.64]And the cool part about the orcs was you just had to have a ton of them.
[94:16.16]The more that you had, the more population, like the better you did, right?
[94:25.39]That's a great game.
[94:27.65]It's too bad.
[94:36.60]Too bad.
[94:37.88]Pepe face.

[101:14.09]He's too powerful.
[101:19.90]I need more leaves.
[101:20.78]There's not enough to hit him.
[101:22.12]My blower is too powerful.
[101:27.34]Oh, shit.
[101:27.94]I didn't get it.

[102:17.60]Addicted.
[102:19.12]He's addicted.
[102:24.60]Come on, spawn the leaves again.
[102:26.10]Damn it.
[102:30.53]Equip your hands?
[102:38.09]Doesn't do anything.
[102:40.17]What about a rake?
[102:41.97]Oh shit, there's another one.
[102:47.29]That one almost did it.
[102:51.53]63,000.
[102:51.67]I have 600.
[102:52.15]Hold on.
[102:54.23]Need more trees.

[103:00.13]I wonder what you get for, like, killing a deer.
[103:02.61]Do the neighbor's yard.
[103:05.51]It's easier.
[103:05.95]I think I'm already invested here.
[103:08.90]I want the other leaves.
[103:14.30]Huel.
[103:16.38]Huel?
[103:16.48]Why are you guys saying Huel?
[103:18.85]Click on this.
[103:24.23]Sing Toxic by Britney Spears for a billion off the debt.
[103:28.39]I'm not sure that's... I don't know if you guys are going to agree to that one.
[103:38.98]I doubt that's actually what you guys are going to do.
[103:42.92]I still have the gold converter going.
[103:46.39]I'm just going to keep that on.
[103:48.83]101 gold.
[103:51.65]I need more platinum leaves.
[103:53.15]Leaf combo.
[103:53.71]There it is.
[103:54.03]Let's go.
[103:54.45]Come on.
[103:55.27]Max combo.
[103:56.04]Come on.
[103:57.32]What the fuck do you think this is?
[104:00.92]Bunnies have a lot of health.
[104:08.05]Start platinum converter.
[104:10.55]Should I?
[104:15.33]It's a hundred.
[104:17.15]It's a hundred per one.
[104:18.45]I'm not, I don't know.
[104:19.31]I don't think so.
[104:19.81]I'm going to burn through that.
[104:20.79]Not yet.
[104:25.79]Are the normal upgrades too?
[104:27.09]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[104:28.01]That's right.
[104:34.07]Deal, deal, deal.
[104:35.09]No, no deal.
[104:36.63]I was so insulted by that initial offer that I just walked away from the table.
[104:47.03]Prestige again?
[104:48.89]Um... I could just buy the portal just to have it.
[104:55.81]I have 171 right now.
[104:57.28]No, I'm not Prestige until I have at least like 5k.
[104:58.72]Look at the snowman.
[105:02.86]Cool.
[105:08.56]You played these shitty games to spite your viewers.
[105:12.13]Um... You think this is a shitty game?
[105:19.69]I don't think that.
[105:23.92]Of course, of course, it's despite them.
[105:27.02]Every time I see the word bald in chat, I just add another 30 seconds to what I'm going to play one of these games.
[105:32.20]Kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it, kill it.
[105:46.55]Oh, this is a good song.
[105:51.89]Alright, I got a lot.
[105:52.69]Let's spend some money.
[105:55.42]More trees.
[105:56.14]More leaves.
[105:57.30]More nuclear fuel.
[106:00.20]And then... Let's do... I need to unlock platinum leaves.
[106:04.06]10k?
[106:04.12]I'm almost there.
[106:05.24]Eh, let's get upgrades.
[106:06.62]There we go.
[106:12.36]Nice.
[106:15.52]Get combos?
[106:16.18]I will.
[106:16.62]That's the next thing I'm going to work on.
[106:22.10]10K Andy.
[106:23.56]A little more than 10K here right now.
[106:35.37]Here's what we're going to do.
[106:39.67]You ready?
[106:41.67]I'm going to pause this.
[106:42.29]I'm going to go take a pee break.
[106:44.21]We're going to come back.
[106:44.73]We're going to do the germicensus.
[106:47.23]And then I'm going to continue to play this game.
[106:48.90]How's that sound?
[106:49.40]You ready for a little break?
[106:56.50]Sounds good to me.
[106:57.01]I'll be right back.
[112:56.52]All ooey gooey cheesy.
[113:08.71]Alright, let's keep going.
[113:12.76]First thing that somebody writes, whatever it is, is edible, I'll eat it for dinner.
[113:21.10]Pizza, alright, cool.
[113:23.53]Thanks for the help.
[113:28.32]Maybe it should be a hamburger.
[113:34.28]It's boring.
[113:36.86]So what?
[113:37.18]So what?
[113:46.60]Let's go.
[113:53.64]Oh!
[113:53.76]I just got 1.2K Platinum Leaves.
[113:59.20]Holy shit.
[113:59.62]Alright, hold on.
[114:02.56]I can unlock bismuth leaves.
[114:04.74]More trees with these.
[114:05.46]I don't know.
[114:08.22]It's probably a mistake.
[114:08.96]Whatever.
[114:17.99]Census.
[114:19.05]Oh, oopsie.
[114:20.09]Alright, here comes... Yeah, let's do the census.
[114:23.29]Let me turn this down.
[114:28.15]So, this is a
[114:30.83]This is an interesting set of images that we're going to look at.
[114:35.75]Here's the 2020.
[114:36.43]This is very elaborate, by the way.
[114:41.51]Out of 1985 respondents, I was there.
[114:50.86]If you were one of them, this is so old.
[114:52.88]This is very old.
[114:53.90]This is from like May of last year.
[114:56.48]Let's make that really clear.
[114:59.48]But a shitload of you probably have not seen this before.
[115:01.42]So I was going to go over it.
[115:04.48]So how long have you been out of almost 2000 people that responded and took the whole thing?
[115:10.27]How long have you been watching the channel?
[115:14.31]Some of you, uh, as of last year, 15.2%, less than one year.
[115:22.62]30% of one to four years.
[115:25.04]The most surprising thing for me here is that 54% of you, more than half of the entire channel, has been here for five plus years.
[115:36.19]That's pretty surprising.
[115:40.99]2012 gang.
[115:43.07]They're lying.
[115:45.78]You had to prove it.
[115:46.46]You had to prove when you made your first YouTube comment.
[115:50.76]So I'm sorry.
[115:51.34]There was a lot.
[115:51.82]A lot went into this.
[115:59.88]Easy.
[116:02.51]50% have been following Drupal for five years, yet 50% also say the most recent arc is their favorite.
[116:08.21]The recent arc is the favorite.
[116:11.43]And we can look at that right here.
[116:12.41]Favorite arc.
[116:13.69]TF Tuber arc.
[116:15.69]Boston arc and then Vegas arc.
[116:21.62]Half of you think that.
[116:23.84]Interesting stuff.
[116:26.04]Alright.
[116:26.42]The one guy experience.
[116:27.34]What do you watch?
[116:29.73]Jerma's stream, Jerma's second, or both?
[116:34.07]Those of you that ask why I have the second channel in the first place is because look at the amount of people that do not watch a stream ever.
[116:44.66]You got 36% of every single one of you.
[116:49.00]Maybe.
[116:51.08]That's the thing with sample sizes, you know, maybe.
[116:57.29]That's why the second channel has tried to, you know, put some time and effort into it, right?
[117:04.15]There's more than a third of you just don't watch the stream.
[117:08.19]In fact, I'm talking to people that might see this on YouTube.
[117:10.42]So to the YouTube crowd, we love you.
[117:14.01]Thanks for watching.
[117:14.83]Wherever you watch.
[117:20.59]Have you ever shown Jerma to your friends?
[117:23.97]Yes, and they liked him.
[117:26.16]Okay.
[117:27.20]No, you haven't.
[117:27.96]And yes, and they thought he was weird.
[117:33.02]That's pretty high.
[117:37.32]Yes, they thought he was weird.
[117:41.15]Oh, and jermaPluto in the chat.
[117:43.71]Up here.
[117:44.89]By the way, it's only a 2.24% margin of error.
[117:50.14]By the way, you see who made this?
[117:51.44]Krosky.
[117:52.06]This is the one who put this together.
[117:53.02]Of our resident mods.
[117:56.48]How often do you watch the stream?
[117:59.19]Every single stream is only 12% of you guys.
[118:02.73]Several streams a week, several streams a month.
[118:04.95]Well, let me be fair.
[118:07.65]Uh, sometimes I only stream several times a month.
[118:14.51]Sometimes you only get like two or three streams a week, but besides that every stream, well, the highest percentage is the, uh, several, several streams a week.
[118:28.82]That's my fault.
[118:29.60]It is my fault.
[118:30.16]12% are lying.
[118:34.76]And then only, look at this one though.
[118:36.50]Look at the purple one.
[118:39.32]Only the Jerma second and only the main channel.
[118:42.06]20%.
[118:42.38]That's bigger than all the other ones besides the several times a week.
[118:46.78]Several times a month.
[118:47.54]That's a huge percentage of you guys.
[118:51.70]The 1.4% statistic shown below could be possible, could be people who possibly not exist due to the margin of error.
[119:01.23]Do you watch Jerma alone or in a group?
[119:03.69]Alone.
[119:06.81]In a group or sometimes both.
[119:11.24]69.
[119:11.28]Almost 69.9%.
[119:14.88]We don't exist.
[119:15.84]Oh no.
[119:19.30]Very cool stuff.
[119:21.62]Very cool stuff indeed.
[119:23.15]There's more.
[119:24.95]You thought there was just one little limit.
[119:26.37]Let's keep going.
[119:27.83]What kind of psycho watches Jerma985?
[119:30.23]Let's find out.
[119:32.73]I asked in 2016, I wrote, how many women do we have in this chat?
[119:36.45]I'm curious.
[119:37.29]We'll find out.
[119:39.56]79% male.
[119:43.32]10.4% female.
[119:44.52]Look, I just was, I was curious.
[119:46.20]I was just curious.
[119:47.60]I was not, what do you want me to say?
[119:48.88]And that 7, 7.8% non-binary.
[119:52.88]And then 2.8% other.
[120:03.53]I just wanted to, I just asked, okay?
[120:13.70]I just had to ask the question.
[120:15.72]It was 2016.
[120:16.36]I just was like, I was just barely live on Twitch.
[120:20.52]I was just barely live like every other day.
[120:22.56]I was like, I'm curious.
[120:25.05]Because we didn't have those statistics on Twitch.
[120:29.16]And then from there, so 79% male audience.
[120:33.10]How old are you though?
[120:34.34]This is why I can tell you guys.
[120:35.46]You said we're 12.
[120:36.61]Are you though?
[120:38.95]18 to 24 is the largest demographic here.
[120:41.39]73.5% of you guys are in the 18 to 24 range.
[120:45.51]Not 12.
[120:45.63]17 or younger is 14.6%.
[120:46.19]You're not supposed to be watching this stream.
[120:59.74]You're not supposed to be here right now.
[121:05.29]What's an R-rated movie in the United States?
[121:07.33]17?
[121:08.01]Well, okay.
[121:12.07]Ban them.
[121:14.60]And then the 25 to 34 is 10.7%.
[121:16.04]There are a pretty significant amount of people that are older.
[121:19.04]35 plus is 1.2%.
[121:19.40]That's where I sit.
[121:30.67]Yep.
[121:32.33]A whopping 0.2% said they were a rat, while one guy said they were Jerma.
[121:38.71]I didn't take this, by the way.
[121:44.31]Here we go.
[121:44.81]We got kind of the world here.
[121:46.56]Those of you that always say, Jerma, how come you stream so late European?
[121:52.86]Jerma, it's like it's two o'clock in the morning EU.
[121:56.10]Why do you do this to us?
[121:57.84]It's because almost 67% of the entire audience is based in the United States, North America.
[122:05.18]EU still takes up a significant chunk of 23%.
[122:08.72]But, you know, I got almost a 70% group of you guys that are in North America.
[122:14.50]And I'm in North America.
[122:18.78]And then after EU and NA, it really shrinks down a lot, doesn't it?
[122:24.44]Asia at 2.1%.
[122:27.26]Oceanic, 4.2%.
[122:28.16]The next one.
[122:29.74]But after EU, Oceanic.
[122:32.61]Interesting.
[122:33.93]And Antarctica...
[122:37.01]Almost 1% of you guys live in Antarctica?
[122:42.46]That seems like a lot.
[122:46.96]Margin of error.
[122:49.16]I'm the biggest streamer in Antarctica.
[122:51.58]I guarantee it.
[122:56.21]And then 0.3% Africa.
[123:00.53]Interesting.
[123:01.35]South America is up there with 2.7%.
[123:07.23]Very cool, very cool.
[123:08.85]Highest level of education.
[123:10.66]Here we go.
[123:12.42]How many fucking doctors we got here?
[123:14.12]Let's see.
[123:16.74]Highest level of education, none, 1.8%.
[123:17.70]Middle school, 6.5%.
[123:18.08]High school or GED equivalent, 56%.
[123:18.84]Okay.
[123:20.02]That's good.
[123:20.46]Look at this one.
[123:32.49]We got, look at these college degrees.
[123:34.13]10% associates, 16.7% bachelors, 2.2% master's degrees.
[123:42.53]5% of you guys have doctorates.
[123:47.60]That's a huge amount of people that have doctorates in this channel.
[123:53.54]Oh, sorry.
[123:54.20]It's 1.2%.
[123:55.74]5.3% of you guys are other, which means it's even higher than doctorate.
[123:59.04]You're a PhD or something.
[124:01.32]So we got 10, 26, like 27, 28, 29.
[124:02.94]Like 35% of you guys have doctorates.
[124:05.24]Rough estimate of annual income.
[124:06.54]Okay, here we go.
[124:07.40]$0 to $99 is 30%.
[124:07.70]$1,000 to $9,999 is 14.5%.
[124:09.62]$10,000 to $24,000 is 12.9%.
[124:30.23]$25,000 to $49,000 is 7.3%.
[124:30.99]$50,000 to $100,000, 3.6%.
[124:31.43]And then 1.8% of you guys have $100,000 a year in income.
[124:33.07]And then 30% of you don't know.
[124:35.43]Looking at this list here, you don't have to give me any fucking money.
[124:38.66]You understand?
[124:39.60]You understand?
[124:57.24]It's part of the reason why saying like only pay me money if you like really are able to and you take care of yourself and your entire life first.
[125:07.37]You don't have to pay me anything if you don't want to.
[125:09.39]Ever.
[125:10.37]Don't ever.
[125:12.03]Here we go again with this.
[125:13.38]But I got data.
[125:14.40]I've got data here that you can look at now.
[125:16.18]1.8% $100,000 plus a year is those doctors.
[125:18.96]But seriously though.
[125:30.06]You don't have to pay me any fucking money.
[125:34.77]You got data now.
[125:37.83]You thought that was it?
[125:38.61]Not even close.
[125:40.51]Here we go.
[125:42.75]What are the top five best emotes on the channel as picked by the census?
[125:49.71]Thanks, CatgirlHeadpat for five community subs.
[125:52.31]11.4% said Fireman's their favorite.
[125:57.45]And that's very close between the jermaPluto and jermaVenus.
[126:04.29]And then the Jerma Dafoe is up there over the rat, which is surprising.
[126:07.70]I don't know how that's possible.
[126:13.84]And here we go.
[126:15.70]Here we go.
[126:16.22]You want to see how powerful you guys are?
[126:20.84]Do you hang out in the pre-stream chat or post-stream chat?
[126:26.74]Pre-stream chat, for those of you that don't have any idea, is the time before a stream starts.
[126:32.94]I don't know why I have to explain that.
[126:35.45]Why am I explaining that?
[126:36.55]You should get that.
[126:39.37]Everybody gets that.
[126:42.07]Almost 25% of you guys hang out in the pre-stream chat, which is where a ton of decisions are made.
[126:49.24]I would say 40% of all stream decisions are made in the pre-stream chat.
[126:57.49]That's pretty accurate for those of you pre-stream chatters.
[127:01.79]I think that's pretty accurate.
[127:03.17]Don't tell them what?
[127:03.83]Wait, what?
[127:04.11]What happened?
[127:06.77]Don't tell them.
[127:12.73]Don't advertise pre-stream.
[127:14.09]Oh, alright.
[127:14.63]Yeah.
[127:14.73]I thought you were talking about me.
[127:17.70]Both, which is interesting.
[127:19.80]So 11% plus 24%.
[127:23.32]There's like 30 to 40% of you guys that are making very, very strong decisions for the rest of us.
[127:30.54]Neither though.
[127:31.49]So 60% of you guys just kind of, yeah, that's, and that's fine too.
[127:34.73]That's good.
[127:36.53]Who else do you also watch?
[127:40.67]Yep.
[127:42.12]It's like, this is funny.
[127:42.78]Cause this is like, I can tell you, this is my list.
[127:48.51]Vinny at 58.2%.
[127:50.47]Joel at 51%.
[127:51.83]Ster at 39%.
[127:53.59]Criken, Etalyx, James, which is UberHacks and over.
[127:59.15]Tomato and Kiwo.
[128:03.43]I could see that.
[128:04.81]I would tell you, like, all these channels here are absolutely worth watching.
[128:16.16]More than half of you guys
[128:19.09]Our Vinesauce crew, which, I mean, these guys have done so much for this channel over the last couple of years.
[128:29.12]It's not surprising at all.
[128:31.52]So, yeah, cheers to Vinny and Joel, obviously, for an incredible amount of support and attention they've gotten from the Vinesauce community over the last few years, I'd say.
[128:42.01]Yeah, that's not surprising at all.
[128:50.78]I just, like, did that to your head.
[128:51.76]Hey, yeah, lean in.
[128:53.40]Hey, hey, cheers to that.
[128:55.16]Ow.
[128:55.52]It's alright.
[128:55.93]You'll be fine.
[129:00.13]Alright, so what about these?
[129:01.63]The top five worst emotes.
[129:07.13]Data may be fucked because I forgot to include jermaMustard.
[129:09.81]Oh, well.
[129:12.23]The TV is the worst, but you can't delete it.
[129:15.01]Something always has to be the worst.
[129:17.03]There always has to be, like, a Lich King, right?
[129:20.67]If I get rid of the jermaTV, something else will take its place.
[129:24.59]It just has to be there.
[129:27.11]Bald coin, 10%, but I don't know.
[129:29.64]Nowadays, I'm not so sure about that.
[129:31.82]We already went over this, but like, I mean, look at it now.
[129:37.14]I didn't delete that emote.
[129:38.26]I left it there.
[129:40.10]And I was ridiculed for having the bald coin emote all the way through 2017, 18, 19, and here we are.
[129:46.61]Then just take a look at the price now.
[129:50.52]Not a bald coin.
[129:51.20]That fucking is worthless.
[129:53.42]But the real one.
[129:55.74]jermaSlug is a bad emote?
[129:58.44]What's wrong with jermaEgg?
[130:00.64]Can you... Alright, reverse this.
[130:01.68]Jerma Dab goes up to the top.
[130:04.53]But I can't... You know what?
[130:05.21]I can delete that now because it's not the worst one.
[130:07.75]Oh, this is actually great data.
[130:11.73]Jerma Merc received the least amount of votes for best emote at 0.2% or only three people.
[130:31.74]I never see that emote, I'll be honest.
[130:35.28]In fact, it's probably the same three people that are using that emote on a regular basis.
[130:42.97]Dermapain, on the other hand, received the least amount of votes for worst emote.
[130:46.87]So 12 people, that's it.
[130:48.83]Dermapain is apparently very high up there, very highly regarded.
[130:54.29]What's your subscription?
[130:55.41]Here we go.
[130:57.43]I am not subscribed.
[130:58.59]More than half of you are not subscribed.
[131:02.15]That's good.
[131:03.11]Just watch.
[131:03.51]15% of you are tier 1.
[131:04.43]2% are tier 2.
[131:06.50]And then 0.8% are tier 3.
[131:07.24]20% of you are Twitch Prime, which that's a huge number.
[131:12.12]And then 10% of you are a GIF sub.
[131:13.68]So, yeah.
[131:25.50]Here we go.
[131:25.80]This is important.
[131:26.64]This is important.
[131:27.34]Oh, wait a minute.
[131:29.27]Wait a minute.
[131:30.43]Oh, yeah.
[131:31.09]I'm going to pat my back on this one.
[131:33.19]Hold on.
[131:33.45]We'll get to it.
[131:34.89]How much have you ever donated to Jerma?
[131:36.67]$0.
[131:36.69]75% of you.
[131:37.45]What's this one?
[131:38.55]One cent to $2.50.
[131:38.93]9% of you have.
[131:41.99]$2.50 to $10.
[131:42.13]7%.
[131:42.15]Over $10 but under $25. 2.8%.
[131:56.93]And then this is interesting here.
[131:58.89]So less than 50 but over 25 is 1.1%, but over 50 but under 100 is 2.4%.
[132:03.73]And then over 100 is more than under 50.
[132:10.13]That's pretty interesting.
[132:14.86]But yeah, again, 75% of you don't give, don't, just don't do it.
[132:19.82]Just hang out, enjoy the stream, chill in the community.
[132:22.02]That's 100% cool by me.
[132:25.02]So what's the best content?
[132:26.10]Here we go.
[132:31.33]What is the best content on this stream?
[132:33.49]Old games, 47%.
[132:34.15]New games, 32%.
[132:34.69]Talking to chat, 48%.
[132:36.31]Playing with others, 27%.
[132:37.25]Playing the game.
[132:39.13]Playing the game is at 13%.
[132:40.01]So those of you that are in this chat right now, that yell at me to play the video game...
[132:57.30]Dude, what are you doing?
[132:57.98]Like, play the game, man.
[132:59.24]That's only 13% of you want me to do that.
[133:03.18]That's like 80 fucking 7% of you.
[133:06.65]Do not want me to play the game.
[133:12.29]Jerma having fun is 60.
[133:13.65]Whatever Jerma likes, 70 in anything is 61.
[133:15.77]They have buzz kills.
[133:22.66]The math doesn't add up here.
[133:25.68]Oh, wait, it doesn't.
[133:26.46]What's that based on?
[133:35.26]Stop.
[133:37.35]You can select multiple answers.
[133:38.77]Oh, okay.
[133:39.75]Multiple choice.
[133:40.31]Okay, cool.
[133:40.91]I see.
[133:44.19]Oh, jermaHeart.
[133:44.99]Well, thank you, guys.
[133:46.47]Yeah, playing the game.
[133:47.29]13% of you.
[133:49.27]Remember that the next time.
[133:50.51]Remember that the next time we're talking about eating dog food for five minutes.
[133:56.53]And that's that.
[133:57.99]And there's one more to look at.
[134:01.79]Really, really cool.
[134:03.01]Last one.
[134:06.02]Very elaborate, I told you.
[134:10.68]This first one is no longer relevant.
[134:13.12]Do you watch the end of the stream bits portion?
[134:14.92]A lot of you actually did.
[134:15.78]A lot of you did.
[134:19.92]But a lot of you didn't.
[134:23.73]Do you take showers?
[134:25.35]Alright, cat or dog?
[134:27.57]Let's see what we have here.
[134:28.61]Both?
[134:30.71]Neither.
[134:31.07]5.2% of you said neither.
[134:32.37]Hmm.
[134:32.51]Hmm.
[134:36.07]Looks like we have a little bit more cat people here than dog people.
[134:41.27]I would consider myself to be a dog person.
[134:44.81]Although, I do enjoy cats.
[134:47.76]I just think I enjoy dogs a little more.
[134:51.00]I would probably say I was a dog person.
[134:53.80]Do you prefer Twitch chat or Discord?
[134:57.44]I thought this was going to be a lot larger of a gap here.
[135:01.87]But tons of you guys prefer Discord.
[135:05.65]Why it's there.
[135:08.25]Do you like Bugleberry?
[135:14.32]No, that's not... That majority rules here.
[135:17.84]He ain't going anywhere ever.
[135:24.88]That's a large amount of people that say no, but that's a much bigger amount of people that said yes.
[135:30.44]Have you ever canceled plans to watch this stream?
[135:34.45]Yes, 38% of you guys have canceled plans.
[135:40.16]Is that what happens when people say, hey, dude, I took work off to watch this stream and it sucked today?
[135:45.92]Oh, I get it now.
[135:46.74]I feel like bad.
[135:54.79]Well, sorry to the 38% of you maybe that took off work or told your friends you were busy for the Die Dallas Encounter stream.
[136:02.07]Sorry about that.
[136:06.12]FTK.
[136:06.80]Oh, no.
[136:08.82]Do you take showers or baths?
[136:11.78]84% take showers.
[136:15.09]Yeah.
[136:15.81]But does that mean you never take a bath?
[136:20.47]Because I do both.
[136:21.09]I mean that 11.3%.
[136:25.37]Where's neither?
[136:28.11]I don't fit in the tub.
[136:31.09]Who takes a bath?
[136:31.89]Well, I take a bath to relax.
[136:33.95]I take a shower to clean, a bath to relax.
[136:36.05]I think that they do different things.
[136:40.99]Would you beat Jerma in a fight?
[136:43.93]No and yes.
[136:46.81]I think a lot of you just underestimate how explosive I could be.
[136:53.39]People just underestimate me.
[136:54.39]No, don't underestimate me.
[136:57.02]I'm explosive.
[137:03.11]No, I'm like, I can fight quickly, very strongly.
[137:14.96]Explosively cute.
[137:18.88]Would you attend a JermaCon or a Jexpo?
[137:22.00]A lot of you said yes to this.
[137:24.40]But I feel like this number drops a ton when the tickets go on sale.
[137:31.33]This probably drops to like 4%.
[137:32.27]So, I'm not so sure about that.
[137:41.74]Does Jerma make your day better?
[137:44.68]No or yes?
[137:47.20]0.6% said no.
[137:49.68]Does that mean it's making your day worse?
[137:51.97]That seems like a lot of people.
[137:54.19]How many people here right now?
[137:55.33]13,000.
[137:56.81]What's 1% of 13,000?
[137:57.27]130?
[137:57.39]So there are 130 people here right now.
[138:02.17]That, like, you're making your day worse.
[138:10.16]Oh, I'm sorry about that.
[138:13.86]Do you eat ass?
[138:15.90]Of course I do.
[138:16.68]Of course I don't.
[138:17.52]A lot of you guys eat ass.
[138:22.67]A lot of ass eaters.
[138:25.13]That's a majority ass eater.
[138:28.72]Are you single or in a relationship?
[138:32.92]Single.
[138:33.60]Hey, got a lot of single people here.
[138:35.88]A lot of people in a relationship too.
[138:40.10]25% in a relationship.
[138:44.79]25% people are lying.
[138:45.59]I don't know.
[138:46.15]I don't think about it.
[138:46.75]I'm not sure about that.
[138:51.41]That's cool.
[138:51.81]There you go.
[138:53.27]That was Kroski that made all this.
[138:56.37]You're going to have to work your magic again in another couple of years.
[139:01.03]Remember, you need a dating app.
[139:04.60]Like a Jerma dating app.
[139:06.58]Do a Cupid stream.
[139:07.98]No.
[139:08.70]I do not think so.
[139:10.88]No, no, no.
[139:11.52]I'm not having any hand in that.
[139:18.63]Oh, and you two can be together and date.
[139:22.09]Oh, that's so cool.
[139:25.25]Like, fucking six months later when you have a ton of relationship problems.
[139:29.01]You guys are going to blame me.
[139:34.61]I'm going to be the reason.
[139:36.04]You guys are both going to be thinking internally, why the fuck did I do that?
[139:41.94]That asshole, like, for content.
[139:44.10]Like, got us on there.
[139:45.90]And, like, fuck that guy.
[139:48.68]That's what happened.
[139:49.61]Not doing that.
[139:55.66]You meet somebody, you meet somebody.
[140:03.01]You need to do a Cupid stream.
[140:04.23]I think it'd be funny to do a fake one.
[140:07.11]Do like a... Have a fake dating show.
[140:15.08]Too many projects, guys.
[140:20.24]You have to put it on the bottom of the list.
[140:22.12]There's too many things that are happening.
[140:25.45]There you go.
[140:26.27]That was the 2020 census that we did in 2021.
[140:27.97]Pretty interesting stuff.
[140:35.26]The Bachelor Jex.
[140:39.28]Alright, let's go back to what we were doing here.
[140:40.70]I need a new OST, please.
[140:53.32]Something we haven't seen.
[140:57.52]Sims furniture The Sims buy theme that's not bad Sims buy theme okay what the fuck was that alright let's go let's go
[141:26.59]So nostalgic.
[141:32.33]After this, I'm picking streamer's choice.

[148:37.58]The amount of people that sing this song and hum this song and have played this song... It's such an iconic song.
[148:46.03]Does the guy that made this song, like, get anything for this?
[148:51.92]Is he the official Sonic the Hedgehog music producer?
[149:00.58]Is this guy's band still doing the Sonic the Hedgehog music stuff for all the other things?
[149:10.08]Yes.
[149:11.76]Alright, that's good.
[149:14.50]I wonder if there's any pressure there.
[149:16.20]Because, like, look at the, like, you know, like...
[149:19.86]follow me set me free like this is everybody loves this song I think he sits there and he's like I need another escape from the goddamn city anything this guy makes is gold it doesn't matter this song sucks I don't even like Sonic the hedgehog and I disagree with you

[167:13.41]Where's the pep?
[167:17.71]This is good OST, but a little too sad for me.
[167:19.55]Here we go.
[167:22.76]I need coins.
[167:23.44]Alright, how we doing on the converter here?
[167:28.26]Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[167:30.50]3,000 coming in.
[167:31.18]Let's get 5k.
[167:46.14]These business leaves are just racking in money.
[167:48.69]Racking in prestige coins.
[168:01.78]What did I say?
[168:02.22]Racking?
[168:02.84]Raking it.
[168:03.92]Raking in money.
[168:04.46]Yeah, racking in money.
[168:05.26]Yeah, that makes sense.
[168:22.71]Everywhere.
[168:23.39]How about some original Nier?
[168:27.09]I'll give it a try.
[168:27.85]Just not Nier Automata, right?
[168:30.25]Nier 1.
[168:30.87]OST.
[168:31.01]Is this the right one?
[168:36.83]Is this correct?
[168:49.47]We wanted Plock.
[168:51.19]Well, hold on.
[168:53.91]I need more abysmoth leaves right now or I'm going to be very upset.
[169:07.16]Can cosmic leaves even be picked up?
[169:08.70]I don't know.
[169:09.48]No, they don't.
[169:09.80]I have to go to another location.
[169:13.34]Something else.
[169:13.98]Let's hang.
[169:27.74]Almost to 5K and then I'm prestiging.
[169:31.13]This is going to be unwatchable, will it?
[169:41.49]Isn't video game music fine?
[169:50.17]a video game ost should be fine right otherwise how would you like play any of these games on stream play shadowlands um I already did I'm shaking you need to play killer instinct
[170:21.56]Alright, fine.
[170:24.77]I just want to hear... Well, you just remind me.
[170:27.51]I just want to hear that... It goes like this.
[170:29.52]Hold on.
[170:30.28]Let me see if I can get this out of memory.
[170:36.63]Anytime that you... I could do an ultra combo in that game.
[170:40.61]And you would catch somebody in an ultra combo.
[170:43.46]I think it was the wolf.
[170:45.28]I remember I used to play against a friend and I would ultra combo the fuck out of him.
[170:47.70]And this is always here every time.
[170:53.90]And then we have a go.
[170:56.33]Ultra!
[170:59.83]Ultra!
[171:01.91]Hold on.
[171:02.23]Let me get it.
[171:07.50]Hello?
[171:08.04]Hello?
[171:14.70]ULTRA!
[171:15.34]Did that work?
[171:17.78]ULTRA!
[171:18.46]I'd just be sitting there going like... ULTRA!
[171:23.32]ULTRA!
[171:23.69]ULTRA!
[171:24.09]ULTRA!
[171:33.36]And I would fuck him up every time.
[171:35.90]And he would leave my house because it was just so bad.
[171:39.07]He couldn't even do anything.
[171:45.67]It was a precise button combo with Glacial.
[171:49.86]Glacier.
[171:50.34]That was a guy I could do it with.
[171:56.06]I'm sorry.
[171:58.36]Killer Instinct Ultra Combo on... What's the animal's name?
[172:05.33]Fulgor.
[172:07.97]No, no, no.
[172:08.27]Not Fulgor.
[172:11.49]What was his name?
[172:13.81]Sabrewolf.
[172:14.46]Okay.
[172:15.16]Killer Instinct Ultra Combo on Sabrewolf.
[172:19.18]Like doing it to Sabrewolf.
[172:20.78]It needs to be done to Sabrewolf.
[172:28.13]Let's see.
[172:28.49]Glacier Ultra Combo.
[172:31.32]Let's see if we can find one that's on Sabrewolf.
[172:32.82]And I'll show you guys how fucking nuts it was.
[172:35.18]Okay, here we go.
[172:53.00]Nah, this is the new one.
[173:24.82]Finish the combo, dude.
[173:26.12]It's 150 hits.
[173:26.42]That was crazy.
[173:26.74]What's the next OST?
[173:34.44]Catherine.
[173:34.98]Okay.
[173:54.20]Catherine OST.
[173:59.50]This is the complete OST, okay.
[174:02.34]This is DMCA.
[174:06.32]Might be.
[174:20.56]Okay, Catherine, let me ask a question about Catherine.
[174:24.18]So I've looked at it before.
[174:26.06]Oh wow, that looks kind of interesting.
[174:28.24]But isn't it kind of like a Qbert game where you just like climb blocks?
[174:31.51]That's where it lost me a little.
[174:44.87]I feel like I probably wouldn't enjoy it that much.
[174:50.23]It gets disturbing.
[174:51.21]I'm sure it does, but I... I don't know if I want to do the Qbert stuff.
[175:06.37]It's also a banned game on Twitch.
[175:08.41]It is?
[175:10.55]Is the music banned on Twitch too?
[175:12.49]Should I not play it?
[175:14.59]No, it's not.
[175:15.19]What?
[175:18.12]I'm not going to pop the Twitch algorithm off, right?
[175:20.50]Somebody's playing Catherine.
[175:22.86]That's a banned game.
[175:24.18]Turn off their stream immediately.
[175:25.44]Alright, what do we got?
[175:28.92]Alright, I can prestige.
[175:30.74]Hold on, not yet though.
[175:37.69]Let's get a few more minutes of this.
[175:54.86]Play Katamari.
[175:55.50]I will.
[175:55.74]I'm just trying to get as much as possible out of this before I Prestige.
[176:03.50]Alright, we're at 5 points.
[176:07.05]Maybe I can get it to like 6.
[176:07.93]More.
[176:10.05]More.
[176:26.33]So we're going to unlock like the next two or three areas.
[176:29.13]And I'm going to dump all my money into... I don't know.
[176:32.39]What should I buy?
[176:33.47]We'll find out very soon.
[176:39.68]Katamari.
[176:40.22]Which... Alright.
[176:40.82]What Katamari OST?
[176:42.12]I feel we played the first one already.
[176:44.16]Which one?
[176:46.56]Your choice.
[176:46.93]What do you want?
[176:48.49]What do you feel like?
[176:52.19]We love Katamari.
[176:53.73]Oh, I thought you guys were just saying that.
[177:04.09]55 gems.
[177:09.37]Alright.
[177:09.89]We love Katamari Sanosti.
[177:19.13]It's kind of loud, but alright.
[177:32.75]I'm just waiting for the Sonic the Hedgehog guide if this sounds like that.
[177:35.01]Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na.
[177:39.99]I should get him to do that.
[177:53.57]Turn it up.
[177:56.46]Alright.
[178:07.09]I can't do this.
[178:07.81]Beatbox with him?
[178:09.29]No, it'd be embarrassing.
[178:10.23]It's so much better.
[178:10.89]Alright, I'm ready to Prestige at 6,000.
[178:22.33]Turn it up.
[178:25.37]I just, I will.
[178:26.09]I don't want to, we have to be able to hear each other talk.
[178:30.35]Nothing I hate more than going to like a bar or a party or a restaurant or something and the music is over a level where I cannot talk to you.
[178:38.73]That's the fastest way to make me to fucking leave your house or whatever.
[178:42.51]If I have to lean in and yell into your ear for us to talk about like what drink you ordered.
[178:48.17]Hey, what'd you get?
[178:50.93]Alright, yeah Wait that happened

[189:31.60]This is a great song.
[189:32.56]What a great song.
[189:38.79]You guys ever think that when you listen to like a video game soundtrack and there might be an artist on there that you listen to, you're like, oh, holy shit, this is really good.
[189:47.51]I've never looked up who this person was.
[189:50.75]I don't know what band this is, but I probably would like their music.
[189:54.01]But I just don't.
[189:55.21]I'm just like, oh, I'm going to listen to that one song that I like that I know that you made great.
[189:58.32]But I'm not going to listen to any of your other music.
[190:04.12]Anybody else do that?
[190:12.40]Yikes.

[191:13.76]60 coins?
[191:14.24]Can I do that again?
[191:16.78]My time travel again.
[191:33.71]30 minutes have just gone by.
[191:34.71]How much money do I have?
[191:36.67]I'm at 41 fucking K. This is huge.
[191:39.62]I need higher combos.
[191:51.12]Combo multipliers.
[191:52.86]That'll help.
[191:56.94]Times 31.
[192:04.97]There's some 8-bit song covers.
[192:07.82]I'm going to start all these.
[192:08.58]Then I can get some void ones.
[192:12.80]Holy shit, this game never ends.
[192:15.48]Okay.
[192:23.50]Void trees?
[192:24.62]I'm going to get this to over 50k.
[192:26.92]Shit, I should have held it and still... I should have held it until I had void trees.
[192:31.54]I can buy one.
[192:44.47]That's a much better technique.
[192:45.67]Bottom to top.
[192:46.77]We'll wait for a few spawns.
[192:48.35]One more, then I'm going to go bottom to top.
[192:49.83]Ready?
[192:52.19]Oh, yeah.
[192:58.74]Oh, yeah.
[192:59.06]That's the one.
[192:59.92]That's the technique right there.
[193:02.72]Let's do... Oh, my automatic pushers are doing great, too.
[193:09.38]Oh.
[193:14.24]You know, I love it.
[193:16.87]More void trees and more void fertilizer.
[193:19.13]And more void apples.
[193:25.97]Tell us a story.
[193:26.87]One day, there was a little boy who went to get a pail of water.
[193:30.55]He got it.
[193:32.75]He filled up his Berkey.
[193:35.93]And he loved it.
[193:36.61]It was clean water.
[193:37.77]It was crisp.
[193:39.15]And all contaminants were removed.
[194:00.11]What do I got?
[194:01.18]45.
[194:01.20]I'm gonna- I'll wait till 50.
[194:02.06]Maybe I should just do it now.
[194:03.78]Fuck it, right?
[194:04.28]Should I just do it now?
[194:05.10]I think I'm just gonna do it now.
[194:11.14]Oh, wait.
[194:11.52]Maybe I should buy another- What?
[194:15.10]Oh, no.
[194:15.32]Okay.
[194:15.48]Use it!
[194:15.72]70,000 fucking coins.
[194:33.35]A laser.
[194:43.73]This is much more powerful for the cosmic ones.
[194:51.55]Oh, look at this.
[194:52.29]More coin shit to do.
[194:53.97]Alright, hold on.
[194:54.65]Is this all max?
[194:56.83]Buy max.

[224:14.89]Payday 2.
[224:15.35]Uh, no.
[224:17.09]What else we got?

[224:21.15]It sucks and made me want to cry.
[224:22.63]Oh, sorry.
[224:29.78]Turtles in time?
[224:31.38]That's a classic.
[224:34.54]You're flushing a bunch of flasks down the drain, am I?
[224:41.79]Rollercoaster Tycoon 3, play it.
[224:43.05]It's so good.
[224:43.69]I have this weird memory where I played Rollercoaster Tycoon 2 on stream.
[224:49.50]Did I play Rollercoaster Tycoon 3 on stream?
[224:52.34]I don't think I have.
[224:53.70]I made a video on it.
[224:59.14]I don't remember.
[225:06.05]The arcade OST, is it different?
[225:12.55]This is high quality.
[225:22.30]Um, this is fantastic.
[225:25.26]What is this?
[225:26.08]Turtles in Time arcade soundtrack.
[225:29.02]Okay.
[225:53.58]Sounds like worse than though.
[225:54.56]Let's see.
[225:56.61]Okay, Big Apple 3AM is a really good indicator if the SNES version is better.
[226:04.61]Hmm.
[226:09.87]I mean it.
[226:15.16]SNES one's better.
[226:22.07]That's much better.
[226:22.59]I would say... I would put that... I would have to say it's way better.
[226:27.49]Let's see.
[226:37.62]Oh, yeah.
[226:38.28]It's way better.
[227:04.74]I feel like this just fits everywhere.
[227:07.02]It's so good.
[227:09.00]It goes everywhere.
[227:13.73]My toe, my toe.
[227:15.41]Wee-oo, wee-oo, wee-oo.
[227:17.87]Oh, gel shot.
[227:28.12]278.
[227:28.16]Alright, I need to get at least a million.
[227:43.87]I beat this game probably a hundred times.
[227:47.51]We've already talked about it.
[227:48.37]Where the fuck is the Narrow Toe OST?
[227:55.95]Why would I play the Narrow Toe OST right now?
[228:02.10]That's just... That's DMCA.
[228:03.44]That's just songs.
[228:14.21]Come on, 300k.
[228:14.85]Come on, more green.
[228:20.89]Converters create more output resources.
[228:22.53]Increase converter output by one for the current- This is a good one too, I love this one.
[228:41.30]Remember your red flasks, holy shit, what?
[228:49.34]What is it?
[228:56.41]I got tons of these.
[228:57.39]I need more output from... I need more output from here, from red.
[229:00.51]I need more red.
[229:04.35]Stop converting.
[229:06.01]What do you mean, stop converting?
[229:14.02]Why?
[229:16.37]Turn off the flask, red flask converter.
[229:18.53]Why would I do that?
[229:20.61]Finally.
[229:21.09]What?
[229:26.25]Don't convert until you upgrade red.
[229:46.24]Alright, I got you.
[229:47.02]Alright, what's my favorite one?
[229:59.59]Technodrome.
[230:02.31]I love the train, and I love Prehistoric Turtlesaurus.
[230:06.24]This is a good one.
[230:15.93]I love this part because it's the guys that charge.
[230:24.21]They just run straight at you.
[230:25.22]Now, how are we doing on red?
[230:37.80]We're doing really good on red.
[230:39.04]Alright, more.
[230:39.60]That was good.
[230:41.76]Where's the skull and crossbones?
[230:43.32]No, not that one.
[230:44.78]There it is.
[230:46.75]Oh, this is classic Jerva making my day worse.
[230:58.04]He's the one with the train, right?
[231:17.31]What was the alligator's name in Ninja Turtles?
[231:28.49]What's his name?
[231:29.51]Leatherhead, right?
[231:32.00]Leatherhead, right?
[231:32.86]I forgot about Leatherhead.
[231:35.54]Oh, Neon Knight Riders is awesome, too.
[231:37.26]This whole thing is awesome.
[231:39.26]This is a really good game.
[231:49.83]Just about to cross.
[231:55.80]Stream it.
[231:58.20]Yeah.
[231:59.84]I should just stream it and beat it.
[232:00.98]You want to have a nostalgia stream where I beat Turtles in Time like three times?
[232:28.64]Let's get green going.
[232:36.45]You cowered it out after dying once in the retro stream last week.
[232:39.27]You think you can beat it three times?
[232:42.41]Well, I mean, that's a little different.
[232:45.03]The retro stream was... There were 620 games on that box.
[232:50.74]I had to... I needed time.
[232:52.32]I wasn't going to give every second dedicated to, like, Ninja Turtles.
[232:58.93]There was like 600 fucking games on that thing.
[233:00.79]Alright, what are we doing on green?
[233:13.73]More.
[233:14.41]I forgot about that.
[233:16.37]Where no turtle has gone before.
[233:18.01]And let me tell you something about the Shredder, okay?
[233:23.35]Super strong, super powerful, has a cool group.
[233:31.85]I'm not gonna do that again, no worries.
[233:42.09]Alright, 55,000.
[233:42.82]Almost time.
[233:43.52]Almost time to just absolutely let this just fly off.
[233:48.36]Want more converter count?
[233:57.00]Shredder Sim.
[234:01.64]What?
[234:05.56]The boss theme.
[234:06.21]Let's get that going.
[234:25.23]I need one million.
[234:33.24]Alright, let's turn on the blue.
[234:36.82]Coming up next, we've got blue.
[234:38.68]I know you're all so excited for it.
[234:57.87]Once this crosses like 50K, here it is.
[235:00.75]Turn on the blue.
[235:13.72]Devils never cry.
[235:19.32]Let's see.
[235:22.07]What's the versus mode one?
[235:23.67]That song was good too, wasn't it?
[235:25.29]Yeah, here it is.
[235:26.17]This is a great song.
[235:37.04]It's the one right after this.
[235:51.65]This is the one I like.
[236:09.42]If that's 10.
[236:18.36]Devil will cry.
[236:20.00]Got a link.
[236:26.08]What do we got this time?
[236:27.48]What do we got this time?
[236:31.14]Joe Biden will erase a billion dollars off the debt if you stream Bionicle Mask of Light.
[236:36.80]It's...
[236:43.21]Why is it, why is it Joe Biden?
[236:54.81]Joe Biden will erase a billion off the debt.

[237:04.18]Stream Bionicle Mask of Light.
[237:05.92]It's free on YouTube.
[237:06.96]Lego will not DMCA you.
[237:09.24]They allow the movie to have free online distribution.
[237:13.95]What?
[237:17.25]Is this a movie?
[237:25.27]You want to watch this movie?
[237:26.31]Okay, alright.
[237:31.34]Fine.
[237:34.34]I'm going to look into this.
[237:36.60]I will stream Bionicle Mask of Light on a stream coming up soon, probably in the next week.
[237:45.62]Is this for real?
[237:50.27]Come on, do it right now.
[237:58.25]Should we get a pull for this?
[237:59.43]That's a pretty significant amount of money.
[238:08.45]This is just a simple yes or no.
[238:09.85]Is it?
[238:11.87]Okay, one billion off the debt if Bionicle movie streamed.
[238:27.66]Okay, here we go.
[238:28.18]I didn't vote.
[238:44.94]How much do we have for current?
[238:45.76]We're at 4 billion right now.
[238:47.12]Currently.
[238:47.48]92%.
[238:47.86]Holy shit.
[238:49.32]Well, I think we have a deal.
[238:56.35]This is a landslide, yeah.
[239:13.42]This is Joe Biden that's going to do this.
[239:21.46]Alright, alright.
[239:22.22]That's unanimous.
[239:23.18]That's 90%.
[239:23.44]Alright, let's go.
[239:25.61]Let's do it.
[239:25.97]Not now, but at some point.
[239:29.15]One of the next streams that you see on this channel is going to be Bionicle Mask of Light streamed movie stream.
[239:36.51]If that's actually true and I can do that.
[239:41.02]If I can truly actually stream that movie, I will.
[239:45.47]I got to look into that.
[239:48.67]Hey, thanks a lot.
[239:49.69]Thanks a lot, Joe Biden.
[239:54.55]Alright, what are we doing?
[240:04.73]Cowabunga!

[240:12.99]Oh, shit.
[240:13.53]Perfect.
[240:13.91]Yeah, I'm keeping this one.
[240:21.14]It's Mega Man X. Alright, this one's ready to go.
[240:32.20]I have so much blue.
[240:38.93]Don't go too crazy with that.
[240:44.09]Gotta get these all 10.
[240:51.27]Alright, hold on.
[240:56.26]Let's get it to 10.
[240:56.74]You have to get Joe Biden on the stream to watch it with you.
[241:17.84]I don't think that's going to happen.
[241:20.24]Sorry to say.
[241:22.10]That would clear the debt.
[241:23.30]I don't know.
[241:25.70]That's not going to happen.
[241:26.61]I can't wait until the part when the Bionicles are about to lose.
[241:38.76]Come on, man.
[241:39.64]This is malarkey.
[241:44.32]I hate everything about this.
[241:48.92]I know, Joe, this is fucked up.
[241:51.46]Hey, watch that language, please.
[241:55.17]I'm sorry, Joe.
[241:57.37]I mean, Mr. Biden, President Biden.
[242:09.08]Mr. President, Mr. President Biden, Mr. Biden, please.
[242:13.60]I'm sorry.
[242:14.00]I didn't mean to say those swear words.
[242:16.49]That's okay.
[242:18.21]But here's the deal.
[242:20.85]You say one more of those swear words, we're going to have a big problem.
[242:28.53]He says Bill Clinton.
[242:37.11]I'm trying to enjoy my, gosh darn.
[242:41.39]I almost just made him say, I almost made him swear.
[242:44.20]I just keep being like, the Bionicles.
[242:59.27]Oh, Joe, Joe, the Bionicles, they're never gonna make it.
[243:02.81]I don't think they're gonna make it, Joe.

[243:54.39]More, more, more, more money, money, money, money, money.
[244:14.20]Bionicle.
[244:18.36]Actually, it might be kind of funny just to have like a few Joe Biden clips of him just telling me to stop talking and enjoying something being like, oh, this is great.
[244:28.11]Wow.
[244:30.03]I'm going to watch Bionicle with Joe Biden.
[244:41.50]Just have a bunch of soundboard here of him enjoying the movie with me.
[244:46.49]I mean, that's kind of a layer there.
[244:48.53]Hire an impersonator.
[244:52.91]Do we have a cam on in the same room?
[245:05.20]No, but then the real Joe Biden has to open the door and be like, what are you doing in here?
[245:11.67]And then the audience track has to be like, woo!
[245:15.83]Woo, yeah!
[245:17.19]Woo!
[245:18.73]And he looks side to side, and they don't stop clapping, and he's waiting, he's smiling.
[245:22.96]Yeah, it's me, the real Joe Biden.
[245:25.60]Not a comedy here.
[245:27.90]And like two full minutes go by.
[245:29.56]Woo!
[245:29.92]Woo!
[245:32.96]All the actors on stage are all looking around, waiting for it.
[245:35.48]Yeah, it's Saturday Night Live.
[245:36.50]Yep.
[245:40.26]And then he just simply goes like, this is malarkey.
[245:42.93]And everybody fucking screams, claps, everybody smiles back and forth.
[245:47.71]And then he just leaves.
[245:54.74]They just get him to do two things.
[245:58.28]And then, no, no, no, no, no.
[245:59.02]Then they all, they all crowd together.
[246:00.86]And they're all trying to wait for each other to cue each other to say, like, live from New York.
[246:03.90]It's Saturday night.
[246:04.40]And they all mess it up.
[246:05.80]So it's like, because Joe Biden is not like an actor or anything.
[246:08.91]So he leans in and he's like.
[246:11.21]It goes something like this every time.
[246:13.59]No, not like that.
[246:18.67]Live from New York.
[246:19.58]It's Saturday night.
[246:23.06]Live from New York.
[246:24.44]It's Saturday night.
[246:27.59]Live.

[246:36.96]Live.
[246:37.64]Live from New York.
[246:39.12]It's Saturday night.
[246:42.47]It's Saturday night.
[246:45.95]They never get it right.
[246:46.93]They never get it perfect.
[246:48.31]They got to work on that.
[246:57.55]Get to a million.

[247:22.55]What's going on here?
[247:23.07]What's going on with the red one?
[247:24.73]What happened here?
[247:27.23]Turn that off for a second.
[247:37.70]Five plus minute political bias joke?
[247:40.84]Wait, what?
[247:41.30]Talking about Joe Biden watching Bionicle with me?
[247:58.77]Turn it back on.
[248:03.02]Turn it on.
[248:07.54]Oh, Big Leaf Crunch is activated.
[248:25.61]Liberal streamer.
[248:34.38]We ain't getting into this.
[248:35.80]Oh, strange flat.
[248:37.72]Alright, stop.
[248:46.49]Oh, mega low.
[248:50.29]Stop it.
[248:51.07]Stop it.
[248:51.77]Stop it.
[248:52.45]Stop it.
[248:53.29]No political talk unless we're making jokes about the way that... Unless we're making Saturday Night Live themed jokes.
[249:02.10]Here's the only political talk we have on this channel.
[249:05.04]Excuse me.
[249:06.64]Excuse me.
[249:08.20]That and... Hey, will you just shut up, man?
[249:18.65]That's like the extent of the political talk on this channel.
[249:22.07]It's me just putting my hands up and going... Excuse me.
[249:25.79]Excuse me.
[249:26.91]That's it.
[249:28.05]That's all I've ever done.
[249:30.28]Or I've ordered like fake hamburgers as Bernie Sanders.
[249:49.17]Mitch McConnell.
[249:50.21]Yeah, but is that political talk or is that me doing impressions of public figures?
[249:59.03]I mean, that guy's a dick.
[250:00.39]Let's just be honest.
[250:11.83]I need 999,000 of these.
[250:12.83]Oh, he's getting political.
[250:32.42]Fuck politics.
[250:33.12]We care about Bionicle.
[250:34.24]Yeah, that's what really matters.
[250:36.36]Is the Bionicle mask of the mask, whatever it was, stream?
[250:45.73]Alright.
[250:46.29]I need to upgrade this.
[250:47.09]Because I need 999,000 of these.
[250:52.35]He's a registered Bionicle.
[251:05.15]That sounds odd.
[251:05.85]That sounds bad to say that.
[251:09.38]That sounds weird.
[251:10.14]I don't... Okay.
[251:10.84]Let's... Register... Like... I got millions of these things.

[252:03.09]What?
[252:04.37]I don't want to crunch.
[252:06.69]No, I don't want to do that.
[252:10.37]Trees can drop exotic leaves?

[252:15.35]292,000.
[252:15.37]Gets you 700 of these.
[252:18.59]I need 900,000 of these.
[252:33.40]Oh, Jesus.
[252:33.96]I need prestige.
[252:35.38]Let's go.
[252:36.18]Wait.
[252:36.38]A drill?
[252:46.29]Fan.
[252:46.69]This is the highest thing I can get.
[252:49.59]A fan.
[252:52.20]Use crunch.
[252:52.86]Use crunch.
[252:53.26]Don't prestige.
[252:53.86]Use crunch.
[252:54.72]Use crunch?
[252:55.26]Crunch it?
[252:56.94]A crunch?
[252:57.28]I'm going to crunch.
[252:58.96]I'm going to crunch.
[253:09.84]But again, I got one crunch coin.
[253:15.37]Greased prestige coins were bought by 200% per level.
[253:22.19]Holy shit, that's insane.
[253:23.29]Greased the combo multiplier by 200%.
[253:31.49]Coin upgrade bought.
[253:38.19]What happened?
[253:38.57]Wait, actually reset it?
[253:39.69]What do you mean?
[253:43.21]Actually reset Omeg... Wait, wait, wait, hold on a minute.
[253:45.39]I just... Somebody just said actually reset Omeglel and I remember their name popped up.
[253:49.05]They said do it, crunch it.
[253:57.03]What?
[254:00.97]New deal.
[254:08.31]I don't even know where I start with this.
[254:11.97]I don't, I don't even know where to start with this.
[254:15.54]New deal.
[254:16.04]If you can get a Biden impersonator to watch the whole Bionicle movie with you with camera on for the whole stream, the entire debt will be wiped.
[254:22.98]Don't waste this chance.
[254:29.59]I'm seeing a lot of no deals though.
[254:32.95]I'm seeing a lot of no deals.
[254:46.57]has to be the real Joe biden well that's not going to happen we can we can have a fun little talk here of like oh that's funny that's not that's never going to be a reality make it a reality no I okay did for that to be a thing I they would have to be I I think this I gotta have like 200 000 concurrent viewers
[255:15.15]Like, I gotta be a 200k Andy for that to even be considered.
[255:19.41]That's not gonna happen.
[255:30.16]Alright.
[255:31.98]No.
[255:32.56]No.
[255:32.74]That's not gonna happen.
[255:36.22]He responded.
[255:39.06]Well, of course I'll watch the Bionicle movie with Jerma985.
[255:41.46]Who's that guy?
[255:46.00]Oh my god.
[255:46.56]Nah, we'll keep it the way it is for now.
[255:53.04]Alright, what did I- Did I really fuck this whole thing up?
[255:55.98]Is it time to- Is it end of the stream voice right now?
[256:10.75]Don't leave us.
[256:14.59]I can't wait to watch Bionicle.
[256:22.58]Realistically, Jeremy, who do you think is the highest ranking member of the government that has ever seen one of your streams or videos?
[256:30.34]I mean, it's probably got to be some random selectman.
[256:35.87]You know what I mean?
[256:37.05]It's probably like the local treasury secretary or something in Nevada.
[256:41.83]I don't know.
[256:42.53]It's probably somebody at the local level.
[256:51.03]It was definitely Dave State.
[256:54.30]Alright.
[256:55.48]I kind of think I'm going to call it here.
[256:58.24]Wanted to stop by for like four or five hours.
[257:02.96]I'm still in the middle of doing a lot of things.
[257:05.44]I will have a shitload of announcements for you guys very soon.
[257:07.94]There's at least one or two announcements.
[257:12.37]And big things that we're going to talk about this next week.
[257:18.59]Delay Danny.
[257:19.79]Delay Daryl.
[257:20.71]Break Andy.
[257:21.23]I'm going to go back to it.
[257:25.39]I will see you guys.
[257:26.57]The next stream will probably end up being...
[257:31.27]either probably Wednesday.
[257:33.47]Wednesday or Thursday.
[257:35.89]Keep an eye on the ground.
[257:40.15]But I didn't want to just disappear.
[257:41.21]I wanted to come back and at least hang out for a little while.
[257:44.85]So, when I come back, though, we've got a lot to talk about.
[257:47.85]A lot to talk about.
[257:49.04]Thanks for watching, as always, and I look forward to the Bionicle movie stream next week.
[257:59.93]This game was actually pretty fun.
[258:01.07]I did not think there was gonna be this much in this game.
[258:04.63]It's a good background game.
[258:06.83]I recommend it.
[258:07.49]Is this game free?
[258:08.23]I think this game's free.
