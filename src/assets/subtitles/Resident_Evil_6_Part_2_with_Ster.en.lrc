[ve:60.16.100]

[00:04.94]I have returned.
[00:05.93]How are you?
[00:09.22]Let me just talk to Ster.
[00:10.30]Hello.
[00:17.94]Are you Baxter?
[00:18.82]Hey, what's up?
[00:26.46]Let me get the game.
[00:27.18]I'm just ready.
[00:27.95]I'm ready to be your neighbor.
[00:31.16]Hold on.
[00:31.42]Let me make sure the audio is good.
[00:38.46]Are you playing in full screen?
[00:39.71]I'm afraid to do full screen.
[00:40.72]It crashed last time I did full screen.
[00:43.37]I am doing windowed.
[00:46.16]You convinced me.
[00:47.89]Yeah.
[00:48.47]Alright.
[00:53.00]Let's get into a game.
[00:53.87]Okay, so we're gonna do, if you didn't catch the beginning of the stream, I've played Resident Evil 6 like four different times with four different people.
[01:02.50]And I think I've only completed one of the campaigns ever.
[01:06.13]Or if that.
[01:09.16]So we're gonna do the Chris campaign.
[01:12.41]This game sucks, by the way.
[01:14.78]This game sucks ass.
[01:18.13]You played half of the Leon campaign.
[01:21.00]Yeah.
[01:23.50]Uh, but, Ster has never played one of these before.
[01:28.05]This is your first Resident Evil experience, is that correct?
[01:31.56]No, I've played Resident Evil 1.
[01:34.39]Okay, you played Resident Evil 1.
[01:35.76]I played a little bit of Resident Evil Nemesis and I've watched like all of the new games be played.
[01:40.74]Okay.
[01:42.04]I'm a spectator to Resident Evil.
[01:49.04]Why would you lie?
[01:50.93]Yeah, you were saying this game was so bad it made them rethink Resident Evil as a whole.
[01:54.41]Yes.
[01:56.33]This game was so bad that it made them actually detonate the entire franchise, and that's how we got Resident Evil 7.
[02:03.89]Uh, okay, Chris.
[02:09.14]Chris.
[02:14.24]Chapter one.
[02:16.43]Okay.
[02:16.61]Difficulty, normal.
[02:17.67]Okay, guys, should we play on amateur, normal, veteran, or professional?
[02:23.72]For real.
[02:24.04]I'm a normal Andy.
[02:25.69]If we're gonna get enough of this done, we're normal Andys, aren't we?
[02:29.48]Professional?
[02:32.55]You're still on the BRB?
[02:33.53]It's alright.
[02:34.13]Everyone's saying professional.
[02:36.14]Don't do it on normal or easy.
[02:40.85]Uh...
[02:44.70]Pro is going to be wild.
[02:46.69]Do you want to try professional?
[02:48.35]No, God, that's no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[02:50.10]That's the one after veteran.
[02:51.53]No, I don't either.
[02:52.25]We're going to do normal.
[02:53.64]You said that this game is like shit, so it's going to be like an awful game and like a pain to get through.
[03:00.17]Yeah, I'm not.
[03:01.74]I thought professional was the one after normal.
[03:04.12]Hey man, I saw you fucking not parrying that boss.
[03:06.96]Yeah, it's fine.
[03:08.00]Alright, do you want to be Chris?
[03:09.65]Do you want to be Chris or Piers?
[03:12.91]Who is Piers?
[03:14.68]I don't even like Chris.
[03:15.76]You be Chris.
[03:17.53]Piers Morgan?
[03:19.15]No.
[03:20.56]Do you want to be Chris or do you want to be Chris?
[03:23.78]Do veteran.
[03:25.09]Alright, we'll do veteran and it's that chatter's fault if we lose.
[03:31.67]I'll be Chris.
[03:33.67]Okay, private.
[03:36.69]Objective setting.
[03:37.95]Playing for fun.
[03:39.28]Serious players only.
[03:41.11]Playing for medals.
[03:42.19]Here for the story.
[03:43.05]Looking for emblems.
[03:44.26]Here for events.
[03:45.18]Why can you even select this?
[03:48.70]Okay.
[03:51.23]I'm gonna invite you in five seconds.
[03:54.90]I'm...
[03:56.63]Hold on, let me get to the screen.
[03:57.72]Oh, Steam notification?
[04:03.55]Wait, don't do anything yet.
[04:08.74]They can't see.
[04:09.50]I said don't do anything yet.
[04:11.27]They can't see the game.
[04:13.08]I didn't do anything.
[04:13.97]Okay, now they can.
[04:18.88]Oh, this is such shit!
[04:20.83]Oh!
[04:21.79]Stop.
[04:25.35]That looks thick.
[04:28.01]He's drinking fucking Mercury.
[04:29.52]+2.
[04:32.69]+2.
[04:33.02]You get +2 your own joke.
[04:37.88]2013.
[04:38.44]Is this is it when did this game come out?
[04:42.15]I love a bar like this that serves steak.
[04:44.76]There was one in Boston.
[04:47.63]A lot of bars serve steak.
[04:50.05]No, they don't.
[04:55.21]I think Badlands Chugs is in this game.
[04:57.34]I don't think that's accurate.
[05:00.28]Like as a cameo?
[05:05.28]I'm gonna turn the game volume up.
[05:16.54]So how about you shut your mouth?
[05:20.91]I'll bet you get the hell out of my bar.
[05:23.18]It should have shown damage over my health meter.
[05:26.66]Wait, is that you?
[05:27.43]That's me.
[05:28.49]I picked Chris.
[05:29.47]You're a douchebag.
[05:31.64]Yeah, why do you think they haven't put him in a game since like fucking this one?
[05:36.03]I didn't know he got relegated to Resident Evil 6 It's all Leon or go home
[05:46.34]He was in Resident Evil 8.
[05:48.49]Well, you just... No, he's... What am I supposed to do?
[05:53.53]I just read that.
[05:58.61]he's in them but like that's the Ethan winters campaign I've never heard of you
[06:06.67]How about this?
[06:07.99]You heard of this?
[06:11.33]Yeah, without spoiling the game, yeah, he's in the game for like maybe fucking 20 minutes.
[06:20.70]When was the last time you could play as Chris Redfield?
[06:22.28]Does this guy not know there's a zombie outbreak?
[06:26.36]I'm so drunk.
[06:27.23]Wait, what?
[06:27.91]Who are you?
[06:29.73]What is this?
[06:30.43]Okay.
[06:32.84]You don't remember me?
[06:34.35]Well, how about them?
[06:38.57]I'm going to be honest with you, man.
[06:39.67]I love Resident Evil as a franchise.
[06:41.14]It's like one of my favorite franchises.
[06:42.84]I don't know anything about this game.
[06:44.67]And I've played it like five times.
[06:47.78]I hope you get well soon.
[06:50.70]That was so loud.
[06:57.74]Hold on, I gotta move my window.
[07:06.42]The game window is pissing me off.
[07:12.49]Yeah.
[07:20.96]It's where you belong.
[07:23.20]No, no.
[07:24.69]I don't want this guy in the military.
[07:28.28]Come on back, man.
[07:30.47]It's the BSAA.
[07:31.79]You don't know anything.
[07:37.68]Wait, all the patrons were... other Avengers members?
[07:44.05]They were all paid actors?
[07:53.05]I can't keep running away.
[07:56.26]I have to face the truth.
[07:58.53]Accept responsibility.
[08:00.35]That's the only way I'll ever remember.
[08:02.58]Ster needs to see the banana thing.
[08:04.00]He probably already has.
[08:07.06]hq to alpha t no change to your mission suppress the bioterror outbreak while proceeding to point ace of spades
[08:17.05]Uh, we're gonna have to get into settings, Andy, after this.
[08:20.78]Okay.
[08:30.38]Hold on.
[08:32.73]I'm not jumping out yet.
[08:34.56]Yeah, me neither.
[08:36.59]It looks kind of shit down there.
[08:37.85]I'm kind of scared.
[08:40.54]Not graphics.
[08:41.75]Does your chest also say a piece of shit on it?
[08:45.82]What?
[08:48.42]Must just be mine.
[08:49.81]Where's the game settings?
[08:51.66]Where's the camera?
[08:53.42]This is the worst menu I've ever fucking used in a video game.
[08:57.45]I cannot believe how stupid this is.
[08:59.44]Where is the menu to do camera like mouse sensitivity?
[09:02.90]This menu is different than when you're Leon.
[09:06.75]Where's the mouse sensitivity?
[09:08.25]There's sub-menus in the control.
[09:13.85]No.
[09:15.36]Targeting?
[09:18.24]Who cares about my dominant hand?
[09:20.28]Screen settings?
[09:22.41]Yeah, I click game settings, then camera settings.
[09:26.51]Eyeball camera settings.
[09:28.69]And then there's another layer.
[09:30.81]Okay, camera speed is already zero.
[09:33.73]How is it?
[09:36.32]Alright, I jumped out.
[09:46.94]Yeah, I'm gonna have to drop the DPI on my mouse.
[09:49.23]How do I do that?
[09:51.10]Do you have a button on the bottom of it?
[09:53.32]Um...
[09:55.11]It'll change the little color that's lit up.
[09:56.93]Grandpa?
[10:01.51]Wow, that's too much.
[10:04.83]Okay, that's a little bit better.
[10:06.36]Alright, that's better.
[10:12.34]Alright, don't- we're playing on veteran mode.
[10:14.23]This is hard.
[10:15.55]Wait, you didn't pick normal?
[10:17.36]I didn't do normal.
[10:18.08]I got bullied into it.
[10:18.82]I'm sorry.
[10:20.59]Alright, so we have machine guns.
[10:27.66]This game's FOV sucks, by the way.
[10:31.12]Can I change it?
[10:31.82]Whatever.
[10:34.27]We're getting prepared for Resident Evil 9 coming out.
[10:37.13]Hey, if this is the... By the way, if this is the third time you've seen me play this game in a video or stream format...
[10:44.10]I know!
[10:48.05]But this is a different campaign.
[10:52.79]I just never completed it.
[10:53.73]This is a whole different Resident Evil experience.
[10:57.23]Alright, you ready?
[10:58.44]Yeah, you open up.
[10:59.17]I got your back.
[11:00.10]Okay, my back.
[11:01.53]Well, you have to do it too.
[11:02.21]We have to do it at the same time.
[11:05.19]I... No, I...
[11:11.36]Your character's 33% of the screen?
[11:14.80]You just shoved that guy.
[11:24.79]What is going- what do we do?
[11:30.89]Did you start shooting civilians?
[11:37.86]Where?
[11:38.41]Okay.
[11:41.53]I think we have to fight the zombies?
[11:45.52]Bastards
[11:52.26]That was way too flimsy.
[12:01.44]HQ to all teams.
[12:04.26]Alright, playing this with two people is kind of annoying because I take up 30% of the screen and you take up 30% of the screen.
[12:13.13]Oh my God.
[12:15.10]Watch out, watch out, watch out.
[12:18.07]That sounds like you doing a voice.
[12:19.48]That was literally you doing a voice.
[12:22.41]That was me.
[12:32.89]Don't split up.
[12:37.19]Sorry.
[12:43.57]Oh, we have to open this door.
[12:49.55]Ow!
[12:51.17]Dude, shape up dude, we're playing on veteran.
[12:55.18]You can increase the FOV?
[12:57.87]Can you?
[12:58.87]Somebody said in the settings?
[13:00.48]Can you actually?
[13:01.02]We'll never find it.
[13:01.87]Yeah, good luck.
[13:02.79]Which one of these random iPhone apps is it?
[13:07.05]Ground is shaking.
[13:08.59]Game settings.
[13:10.26]Graphic settings.
[13:13.15]No, I did this is.
[13:16.75]Screen settings?
[13:18.46]I feel like if there's a way to change it, it's like an INI file or something.
[13:21.71]One of the screen icon ones?
[13:28.78]HUD position.
[13:31.21]Subtitles.
[13:32.94]Screen settings, you open it up and it's just one giant thing for brightness.
[13:37.39]There's a whole menu.
[13:38.82]Hold on, hold on.
[13:40.05]Camera controls, camera speed.
[13:44.27]Aiming speed.
[13:45.38]Direction for aiming.
[13:47.66]Set camera pattern for dashing.
[13:51.89]It's a submenu in this menu.
[13:53.62]What?
[13:55.87]What the fuck is this telling me?
[13:59.26]No, what is this telling?
[14:01.05]Okay.
[14:03.78]What the fuck?
[14:05.98]I think I'm just living with that.
[14:07.98]I don't even care.
[14:08.39]That's too much.
[14:11.34]I don't even believe that there's an option for it.
[14:13.87]They're gonna really love us.
[14:16.62]I'd be shocked if there really is I need you
[14:28.82]Alright, time to play.
[14:32.09]It's healing itself.
[14:36.06]Yeah, this one they have guns and they shoot back.
[14:41.49]It's the same kind we dealt with back in Edonia.
[14:44.67]Alright dudes, you don't have to yell it in my face.
[14:55.87]You can only change the FOV when you're in the main menu.
[14:59.39]Oh god.
[15:00.28]We'll do it in a minute.
[15:03.05]Yeah, this is... this is something.
[15:07.10]Yes.
[15:10.22]Dude, this is the worst game ever.
[15:12.14]They made the zombies, like, have machine guns and shoot rocket launchers.
[15:17.00]I guess that you could...
[15:18.42]Hold on.
[15:19.31]I can't talk.
[15:20.21]Thank you.
[15:25.20]Well, the zombie was also trying to hide its identity with a mask.
[15:28.48]Because once this war is over, it's going to want to go back to a normal life.
[15:34.75]Also, if you're noticing that the only game we've played so far is both press V on a door.
[15:41.12]Yes.
[15:42.18]The only thing we've shot so far was a cutscene.
[15:45.44]Somebody said, I cannot believe you chose the Chris campaign.
[15:48.83]That's why we're doing this.
[15:55.12]Hey, come over here.
[15:55.91]We have to press V on this door.
[16:00.73]How many people does it take to open a door?
[16:02.68]Four.
[16:06.18]God.
[16:16.87]This game is actually terrible.
[16:19.95]What am I... Why did we specifically need Chris for this?
[16:29.04]Oh, I got 50 skill points.
[16:32.11]Dude, I just suplexed that guy.
[16:34.95]This game's vibe- vibes are rancid.
[16:38.12]Yeah, trust me.
[16:39.65]Alright, so what does that reward if we beat this campaign?
[16:42.52]I'm getting a headache without the build-up units.
[16:45.63]Wait, let us just get to a thing, so then we can go to the main menu.
[17:01.19]Why are we not playing 5?
[17:02.39]Because I've never...
[17:04.24]I need to, like...
[17:05.34]If Resident Evil 9 is coming out, I need to at least complete some of this game.
[17:17.68]hey Jerma come here what is it?
[17:19.87]this table's you what do you mean?
[17:27.38]What are you talking about?
[17:34.16]What are you fucking talking about?
[17:44.08]You are never going to beat this campaign.
[17:46.72]Alright, that's one person that wants to see this.
[17:49.69]How long is it?
[17:50.92]I don't know, like seven hours?
[17:53.47]These bullet impacts, by the way, feels like less than paintballs.
[18:00.12]Don't use all your bullets like I just did.
[18:02.29]Don't do it as a joke.
[18:03.68]We actually are going to run out.
[18:08.10]They're talking through like mics.
[18:10.07]You chose Xbox mics when you shoot these guys They're like
[18:16.84]Okay, that could have been in the game.
[18:17.99]I don't know if that was you or not.
[18:19.94]That sounded like that was somebody behind this door.
[18:33.80]Oh shit.
[18:46.93]Dude, nice shot.
[18:49.24]You did finish the Leon campaign.
[18:50.65]Yeah, that was like the only thing I did.
[18:53.84]I've never seen anything else in this game.
[18:59.99]We're not doing the Ada and Kuk campaign.
[19:04.93]I don't know what that is.
[19:14.97]Uh, conservation of mass.
[19:21.59]Equivalent exchange.
[19:22.62]Come on.
[19:27.70]Why are they all not reacting to this?
[19:42.70]Alright, unload it.
[19:54.95]I'm tripping over people, dude.
[19:57.74]How do I throw a grenade?
[19:59.43]How do you throw a grenade?
[20:00.96]How do you throw a grenade?
[20:02.32]What is a grenade?
[20:04.03]What is going on?
[20:06.22]What the fuck?
[20:08.75]Get this guy off me.
[20:10.36]Get this guy off me.
[20:11.27]I got him so heavy on me.
[20:13.34]He just slipped.
[20:17.53]It just made me watch.
[20:18.93]I got the same cutscene of you dying.
[20:28.95]We're on veteran, man.
[20:31.90]Can't just run in there.
[20:33.69]Dude, the fucking tripping.
[20:37.16]Oh, my stomach hurts.
[20:41.80]ow please fix the fov I we will in a second dude we haven't gotten one
[20:49.79]This game is so loud!
[20:53.99]Why am I shooting from the other side?
[20:55.51]What the fuck am I doing?
[20:57.03]What is... What am I activating?
[21:04.59]I wish I knew how to throw a grenade.
[21:07.71]Where are you?
[21:12.41]How'd you do that?
[21:13.84]I'm on keyboard is X.
[21:19.24]You're going to need that.
[21:25.30]What is the button for grenade?

[21:33.77]What the fuck, dude?

[21:44.40]Wait what?
[21:44.95]Why do they evaporate when they die?
[21:47.96]Yeah, the big arm guy wasn't even here when it reset.
[21:53.49]How do I switch back to the other angle?
[21:56.96]I'm looking up at the left shoulder right now and I... Stop!
[22:07.76]Why are you not picking up any ammo?
[22:09.27]Why is Z a button?
[22:13.19]It's X?
[22:15.56]No, no.
[22:15.88]How do I... How do I switch it to back over the left shoulder?
[22:18.77]Over the right shoulder.
[22:22.57]I don't know, I'm pressing random buttons.
[22:28.14]My chest actually hurts right now.
[22:30.15]That's actually the hardest I think I've laughed in at least a couple months.
[22:34.00]That hurt.
[22:35.39]B?
[22:37.64]Space bar.
[22:40.30]Little mouse.
[22:41.12]I'm clicking everything.
[22:42.49]Cue.
[22:45.07]Check the settings.
[22:46.43]See?
[22:47.20]Were you scared to check the settings?
[22:50.73]Yeah, good luck trying to find the menu to do that.
[23:01.71]Health tablet.
[23:05.31]Next weapon.
[23:06.04]Next weapon, alt.
[23:09.92]walk is left control z is dodge roll I can't find it on here
[23:17.08]Crouch shortcut.
[23:20.21]Roll forward shortcut.
[23:22.52]Roll forward is three?
[23:23.80]What the fuck are you talking about?
[23:27.00]Mix herbs.
[23:27.90]Delete items.
[23:29.59]The rules are Z, C, and 3.
[23:33.68]Where is this button?
[23:37.35]And Caps Lock?
[23:40.86]Oh, thank God.
[23:41.76]Okay.
[23:43.95]Alright, um... Are we at a point where we can...
[23:46.78]I think we have to beat Chapter 1-1, which I think we just did.
[23:55.12]Alright, are we... Why is everybody following me?
[23:56.83]I don't know where the hell I'm going.
[23:59.52]It's not this door.
[23:59.97]Apparently you can command them with V.
[24:02.81]This is a nightmare game.
[24:04.20]Yeah, and by the way, we're not leaving.
[24:06.45]Can we share loot?
[24:20.17]Conserve ammo, for real.
[24:30.77]What did you just do to that guy?
[24:35.22]I gotta turn the volume of this game down.
[24:40.78]I'm so confused with what's going on in this game.
[24:44.15]How are you meleeing?
[24:45.02]I switch to the knife and then left click.
[24:49.39]I don't think I have a knife.
[24:57.37]I guess you don't have a sniper rifle.
[24:59.30]I do not.
[25:01.13]We're getting skill points too.
[25:16.79]Rrrrrr!
[25:31.03]I feel like we're not even playing a Resident Evil game.
[25:34.89]My ammo.
[25:42.61]Two was crouch for some weird reason.
[25:44.43]Yeah, two is duck.
[25:45.94]That's strange.
[25:49.06]Why do you even have that button?
[25:50.91]It doesn't stay down.
[25:52.24]Oh, hey, shoot this and you get points.
[26:01.26]for files and figures.
[26:03.37]Do I have to paint them?
[26:06.25]I hope not.
[26:08.55]Alright, we're almost at the end of chapter 1-1.
[26:10.26]Oh my dude, that was so scary.
[26:13.03]I felt that in my heart, in my chest.
[26:21.22]You could open that yourself.
[26:22.80]HQ to Alpha.
[26:25.49]We've lost contact with the recon unit.
[26:27.30]Proceed with extreme caution.
[26:29.59]Roger, HQ.
[26:34.97]I'll tell you what I don't like about this game is sometimes the red dot is in the wrong spot.
[26:40.08]It moves around.
[26:42.73]But is that supposed to be your accuracy or something?
[26:46.01]Yeah.
[26:46.66]What the hell is that?
[26:54.51]Hahahaha!
[27:02.48]Oh.
[27:07.66]It's the guy who said don't waste ammo.
[27:11.71]It don't matter.
[27:12.40]It actually doesn't seem to matter.
[27:15.19]I'm pretty sure you can like head stomp them when they're on the ground
[27:21.14]Man down!
[27:22.49]Good luck.
[27:27.37]Charlie team, they've taken heavy casualties.
[27:31.81]Check in here.
[27:32.87]I feel like I'm having a dream that we're playing this.
[27:36.11]Do you know what I mean?
[27:36.61]This feels like we're in a dream.
[27:39.32]This is what my brain would say was happening in a Resident Evil game.
[27:44.90]Actually, I had a dream about you last night, sort of.
[27:47.80]Wait, hold on.
[27:48.34]Wait till I turn this down.
[27:49.34]Hold on.
[27:56.26]Okay.
[27:57.51]I think you're good to tell me about your dream.
[27:59.84]I had a dream that uh you told me to apply for mod moderator for your channel and I had to like go through your moderators you wouldn't just give it to me and they gave me like a trial
[28:09.03]Like there was like quests I had to do.
[28:11.43]Yeah.
[28:13.10]Did you pass?
[28:13.74]That's all I know.
[28:14.51]No, I was just in shock.
[28:16.92]I was like, why is he making me do this?
[28:19.31]End of dream.
[28:24.15]Well, your application was denied.
[28:25.77]Sorry.
[28:27.20]Yeah, I know.
[28:34.40]Is it that guy?
[28:40.27]I don't know.
[28:41.43]There's 60 rounds spent on the guy facing the other way.
[28:52.37]I see what you mean, though.
[28:53.75]The thing about Resident Evil games, even the action ones, is a bullet feels, there's weight to it.
[29:02.26]is the ace of spades.
[29:04.39]The UN staff that have been taken hostage are inside.
[29:07.41]Proceed with extraction.
[29:12.92]Alright, guys, if we stop right here and we go to the main menu and do the FOV thing, are we going to come right back here or should we wait till the chapter ends?
[29:20.63]We're going to be the chapter end for sure.
[29:25.44]I don't believe it.
[29:36.43]We're gonna go up.
[29:39.09]Wait till the chapter ends?
[29:40.06]Okay.
[29:46.72]Have any of our stormtrooper friends shot one time?
[29:51.84]Uh, no.
[29:54.14]Was that supposed to be difficult or something?
[29:55.51]That was weird.
[30:03.33]What am I doing here?
[30:10.47]Where are you?
[30:11.27]Are you up there already?
[30:12.30]I'm trying to command the troops and see if it did anything.
[30:15.66]You can like bank them and stuff.
[30:19.76]I don't know if that's supposed to be for co-op.
[30:23.73]I guess we both get a... like a buddy.
[30:29.69]If you hold down V, it gives you like a talk to the menu.
[30:33.58]So you want to see if they can handle the boss?
[30:36.09]Alright, don't fight.
[30:37.03]Just send in our friends.
[30:40.42]I don't think they're going to do anything.
[30:43.87]Um...
[30:51.64]Why was I faking that?
[30:54.29]Oh, they're shooting.
[30:54.90]I was faking that.
[31:00.62]That makes you really wonder how much else has he been faking.
[31:04.74]I mean a lot.
[31:13.56]I'm dead.
[31:14.15]Oh, they got me.
[31:16.69]Just kidding.
[31:25.05]I actually kind of need a heal.
[31:32.53]Oh, you just do the salt shaker in your hand and you just take some salt and you heal.
[31:38.06]It's one on the keyboard.
[31:49.40]Alright, we're going up.
[31:50.29]It's crazy that after this, they actually said, what if we made good games and then actually did it?
[31:55.28]And then Capcom went on to be, like, arguably...
[31:59.53]I thought I did something wrong.
[32:01.80]Capcom's, like, now my favorite game company.
[32:06.21]I think they've been hits for... What am I doing?
[32:09.59]I think you have to protect me while I do this.
[32:14.70]Are you shooting me?
[32:15.96]I've just been shooting your ass.
[32:17.97]Alright, they're shooting me.
[32:21.20]I'm reloading, man.
[32:25.79]I'm out of ammo from the joke shooting your hands.
[32:28.89]There's no way you hold on to this the whole time.
[32:34.54]I gotta catch my breath.
[32:36.81]OK. Get guys in front of me.
[32:42.35]Couple zeds.
[32:45.38]Nice job.
[33:05.04]You think they would spawn more than two enemies during that?
[33:15.31]Are you saying, oh baby, oh baby?
[33:18.14]I'm saying move in.
[33:27.03]That is the fastest I've ever seen somebody climb a ladder.
[33:37.24]I think we're separated.
[33:39.01]Yeah, this is giving real army of two vibes.
[33:43.21]This isn't a bad video game.
[33:47.30]It's a bad Resident Evil game.
[33:48.85]Uh...
[33:55.71]We'll see.
[33:59.12]So you have to put your first skill point in.
[34:02.44]Yeah, I don't have to.
[34:04.62]equip skills none none none none maybe we should have played on professional
[34:14.88]Did I accidentally select easy?
[34:16.29]I hope so.
[34:22.84]What?
[34:23.38]Where am I going?
[34:33.72]Yo.
[34:36.07]Yo, what's up?
[34:38.76]How am I that railing?
[34:43.10]Alpha needs to move out the way for space.
[34:45.33]Can you relieve them?
[34:46.76]Roger.
[34:47.02]Coming in from the four of hearts.
[34:50.19]Copy that.
[34:55.99]Alright, you gotta open that door for me.
[34:58.93]I have to get over there.
[35:00.58]Hold on.
[35:05.41]I just get like a cutscene of me waiting at the store.
[35:09.38]I get the fuck outta here!
[35:10.47]Where is he?
[35:11.41]I don't know where to go!
[35:13.46]Dude, there's a giant flying guy.
[35:15.64]There's a bat flying here now.
[35:19.37]Uh, excuse me.
[35:20.30]Help, there are bats.
[35:21.08]There are bats flying over my head right now.
[35:26.62]I can't look up.
[35:30.79]Alright, I made it.
[35:38.33]Monk, a gig of Robert Downey Jr.
[35:50.29]Hey, we're going to go up here.
[35:51.50]We're going to take a right at the end of this hall, at the end of this corridor.
[35:55.29]Okay.
[35:56.62]Okay.
[35:57.18]Shit.
[35:57.52]Now, um...
[35:58.89]I think that we go up.
[35:59.93]There's a ladder here that wants us to go up.
[36:03.32]Okay.
[36:03.50]Okay.
[36:04.69]From here, I think it wants us to go... Is this down?
[36:09.15]Does the indicator says to go this way?
[36:15.20]And I think we'll keep going forward from here, I think.
[36:17.71]Wait, it might be...
[36:18.69]Wait, I think I have that wrong.
[36:21.58]No, it was right.
[36:22.22]I had it right.
[36:25.19]we're taking some major heat over here
[36:32.23]They're shooting bullets at me and I'm putting my hand in front of my face like there's flies.
[36:37.87]Like, ugh, ugh.
[36:42.46]It's kind of annoying.
[36:47.21]Calm down.
[36:47.71]I shot you with a revive bolt.
[36:55.55]I'm out of ammo.
[37:01.36]Well, you better start stabbing.
[37:04.03]I don't have a knife.
[37:05.61]Well, you better start punching.
[37:09.41]There's ammo here.
[37:18.04]That shattered that guy's skull!
[37:20.08]Man, these guys all have machetes.
[37:28.32]It's still so funny to me every time they're screaming.
[37:35.65]You could put the last 10 seconds in front of each other.
[37:40.21]The last like maybe 15 seconds of what we've just done.
[37:44.27]and I don't think it's been different at all but I think it's been the exact same thing don't shoot that barrel for the joke because I want to
[37:52.67]Oh my god.
[37:53.50]I mean, sorry.
[37:56.75]Dude, are you alright?
[38:03.54]Oh, thanks.
[38:05.69]Wait, where'd we go?
[38:06.78]Down.
[38:12.58]Yeah, loop the last 25 seconds, and there's been no change.
[38:19.06]How do I heal myself?
[38:21.00]It's one.
[38:22.17]Hit one and it heals.
[38:29.04]Do you even have an inventory?
[38:30.88]Like where's your inventory?
[38:33.11]You good?
[38:34.50]I'm trying to figure this shit out.
[38:37.95]I feel like I just combine the heals and use them in my health.
[38:40.74]I don't know.
[38:41.02]I'm still in complete pain.
[38:53.00]I'm telling you, I feel like we've seen the same 10 seconds.
[38:57.46]They're getting us ready.
[39:03.58]Bravo team has been dispatched to assist with search and rescue.
[39:07.09]Stand by for instructions.
[39:08.30]I thought, did you just do that?
[39:10.13]Yes.
[39:10.75]I needed a break.
[39:14.65]Get him?
[39:18.67]Who are you getting?
[39:24.30]I can't even look up that high.
[39:32.40]Alright, we gotta hold out.
[39:33.21]That light is hurting my head.
[39:40.10]Guys, look down, look down, look down, look down.
[39:45.15]I'm dead.
[39:48.69]Oh, wait, that got real confusing.
[39:50.76]Are you dead?
[39:53.11]Yeah.
[39:54.36]No, did we actually lose?
[40:04.20]Alright, we can't fuck around now.
[40:10.37]One swipe was my entire health pool.
[40:17.51]Get that shit out of my eyes.
[40:18.86]That's so irritating.
[40:21.75]Turn!
[40:23.24]It's okay.
[40:25.12]I don't know how to take out like a grenade.
[40:27.59]Uh, it is F. Alpha team surrounded by hostiles.
[40:30.35]Get to the ace of spades on the double.
[40:37.39]Alright.
[40:41.79]What the hell is my character doing?
[40:45.43]I took out the grenade and now when I click I just do random kicks instead of throw it.
[40:51.01]Get outta here!
[40:53.58]Oh shit.
[41:00.41]Run, run, run.
[41:01.97]Okay, we're good.
[41:16.83]Watch out bogeys!
[41:18.93]Make sure you get the items too, man.
[41:21.65]There's a lot of loot.
[41:22.86]It doesn't matter.
[41:23.55]I don't know how to use any of them.
[41:25.44]Well, we'll do it at the cutscene.
[41:27.23]After the cutscene.
[41:34.88]I also feel like we're playing the game in x3 speed.
[41:42.05]Okay.
[41:49.58]Uh oh.
[41:50.14]Where is Bravo Team?
[41:51.53]Where the hell's that backup?
[42:08.06]OK, I'm out of ammo for real.
[42:10.04]There's an herb here.
[42:14.86]Alright, we're good.
[42:18.05]What did he call them?
[42:24.62]I don't know but Luke Luke get
[42:32.80]Should we be fighting?
[42:35.07]Yeah, it said eliminate all enemies.
[42:38.83]There's so much shit over there, dude.
[42:39.87]Don't lose it.
[42:43.21]Alpha team, help Bravo team get the civies out of there.
[42:50.52]Nice.
[43:00.42]Okay.
[43:02.47]I think that may have been... No, not yet.
[43:04.92]We just said saving.
[43:09.18]Did that count?
[43:10.73]Okay, that technically is correct, I think.
[43:19.54]So now if we leave the game... End the session.
[43:29.35]Wait a moment.
[43:30.45]Okay.
[43:34.98]Okay.
[43:37.50]Alright, so graphics settings.
[43:43.07]It's not in the graphics settings.
[43:43.98]Have you left the game?
[43:44.84]Yeah.
[43:45.51]oh like Chris is still I didn't even see it you he left the game camera maybe
[43:57.83]Oh my god, thank goodness.
[44:01.64]Default... What should we do?
[44:03.25]Is 15 way too much?
[44:06.89]I don't... What do these numbers mean?
[44:10.05]Oh, by the way, the brightness screen.
[44:12.60]Right.
[44:12.88]Adjust brightness until the six is barely visible.
[44:15.65]You guys don't even know.
[44:18.05]You can't do 90.
[44:19.20]It's 0 to 15.
[44:26.79]Just max it all out?
[44:27.84]I feel like it's gonna be miserable.
[44:29.58]Maybe seven.
[44:33.28]Wait, the higher the number, the closer you will be positioned to the side.
[44:36.42]I feel like this is gonna be irritating.
[44:40.89]Seven?
[44:42.02]Maybe six.
[44:45.60]What are you going to do for yours?
[44:46.71]I think I'm going to do 7.
[44:47.53]15 default.
[44:50.01]You're going to do 15?
[44:52.34]I'll do 8.
[44:55.76]Definitely 15.
[44:56.71]Do 15.
[44:58.24]Alright.
[45:00.36]We'll try 15.
[45:04.74]this game there's no way this game gives me too much field of view after what we just did true I'll preach
[45:15.12]OK, play game.
[45:18.44]Campaign continue.
[45:25.24]There it is.
[45:25.98]Okay.
[45:30.16]That's fine.
[45:30.86]That's fine.
[45:36.46]And now I can join, have you join?
[45:39.25]I think.
[45:41.84]Steam noise.
[45:43.47]Yep.
[45:43.57]Incoming.
[45:44.61]Steam noise incoming.
[45:53.63]Failed to join.
[45:54.35]Let me try it again.
[45:56.04]Steam noise incoming.
[46:09.25]Hey, there we go.
[46:10.64]How's the game audio?
[46:13.01]Should it be lowered?
[46:17.50]Make it louder.
[46:28.14]What do you want the tutorial?
[46:29.66]Ah, this looks way better by the way.
[46:33.40]I need to find out how to throw a grenade.
[46:35.85]Okay.
[46:45.60]It's F, and then you cycle through what you have, and then once it's selected, you hold right click, and then you throw it.
[46:54.43]Oh, right click.
[46:55.47]Yep, it's a right click.
[46:57.50]Okay.
[46:57.68]Alright, you ready?
[47:00.12]How are you on health?
[47:01.32]I'm pretty bad on health.
[47:03.01]I don't know which bar is my health.
[47:05.67]Uh, the top one, the one with the cubes.
[47:09.16]Okay, I've got all my cubes.
[47:10.59]I have two cubes only.
[47:15.22]Yeah!
[47:21.87]I think it gave me back all my ammo and health when I rejoined you Really?
[47:27.68]Yeah
[47:31.25]Because I guess like the co-op partner isn't saved.
[47:39.94]Dude, this is...
[47:46.64]I didn't know he was running at me like a zombie!
[47:52.34]There's no reason why you would do that.
[47:56.11]You would make it quick.
[47:57.18]You'd make it clean.
[47:58.12]I just beat the shit out of him.
[48:02.18]Alright, can we tell our guys to stop sprinting around corners at us?
[48:08.59]I melee take down every enemy from now on.
[48:14.45]You shoot them once in the head and you can walk up to them and it gives you like the prom.
[48:29.35]Ooh, goodies.
[48:37.30]Clear.
[48:37.70]You don't even know it's clear, I just kicked it.
[48:40.53]Clear.
[48:44.58]I don't even know how to get in my inventory, if we even have one.
[48:51.96]Uh, that was...
[48:52.91]I don't remember.
[48:57.25]That was E. E?
[48:57.83]Okay.
[48:59.60]Hold on.
[49:07.00]What?
[49:07.82]How do I cycle this menu?
[49:11.89]Oh my god, this is miserable.
[49:14.40]I love that animation.
[49:16.35]It's like, I just woke up.
[49:18.48]Leave me alone.
[49:21.47]One weapon?
[49:22.23]No.
[49:23.26]Okay.
[49:24.08]Okay is space.
[49:26.35]Oh, store in case.
[49:28.20]What?
[49:28.82]No, I want to use it.
[49:30.69]What the fuck did I just do?
[49:31.99]I just stored it in the case.
[49:35.76]Huh?
[49:44.04]I love how he's just kicking.
[49:51.64]Why would you snap a guy's neck?
[50:00.25]I don't want to grab a zombie.
[50:01.80]Why would you ever want to... Like, oh, you know what?
[50:03.37]It's a good idea.
[50:03.85]I'm going to go behind him and grab him by where his mouth is.
[50:08.10]Just don't get bit.
[50:14.60]Take this.
[50:17.20]A flashbang is not blue.
[50:22.33]This game is so bizarre because they made Resident Evil 4, which is arguably one of the best games of all time.
[50:27.93]They made Resident Evil 5, which is this one's pretty great, but not quite as good as 4.
[50:32.06]It was good though.
[50:33.59]And then it's just like, let's just... What happened here?
[50:36.96]I don't even know what happened.
[50:40.30]It was like, I don't know what games were popular at this point in time was like Gears of War just popped off.
[50:46.71]They're like, oh, we can do that.
[50:50.26]Watch out, bugs.
[50:50.63]Are you saying ew?
[50:53.34]Ew!
[50:54.02]They have guns.
[50:57.13]They leaned off the ceiling and have guns.
[51:02.38]What is the point?
[51:04.77]This is like late stage Resident Evil, you know what I mean?
[51:07.96]They needed to reboot the whole fucking franchise.
[51:13.76]Eliminate the hostiles in there and get those people out of there.
[51:19.68]I'll be here.
[51:20.35]Roger that.
[51:21.39]We're going in.
[51:23.92]Yes, I made them hostages!
[51:28.20]Get him.
[51:30.17]Don't hit the hostages.
[51:30.83]Don't hit the hostages.
[51:38.23]Um, we have to chase this person down.
[51:40.40]Hodge is secure.
[51:53.52]Did you get the other one?
[51:55.08]Did you get the other one?
[51:56.57]No.
[51:57.65]Oh my god, dude.
[51:58.56]This room is...
[51:59.24]There's 10 in this room.
[52:01.05]There's 10 in this room.
[52:02.69]I can't move.
[52:06.55]I...
[52:09.34]I think I did it.
[52:09.94]Watch out!
[52:13.80]Uh...
[52:18.04]Oh, thanks for punching me in the chest kind of hard.
[52:25.24]Get off!
[52:32.70]You got any heals?
[52:34.50]Wait, I have to put that in my case.
[52:37.68]Put to case.
[52:38.77]There is a discard for items, so maybe I can drop heals.
[52:42.04]I don't know if I can use heals on you.
[52:45.70]Why can I not just eat the whole bottle of pills?
[52:50.13]I have to do this individually each time?
[52:51.78]No, I don't.
[53:04.01]You see, like, don't do that!
[53:06.70]He's sitting here...
[53:07.44]Wait, we need to look at the indicator.
[53:09.71]Alright, there's another hostage somewhere in here.
[53:12.02]Alright, this guy actually has to get the fuck out of the way.
[53:18.57]Up.
[53:34.89]You know, it's almost like people kind of don't want it to...
[53:40.09]You know, we gotta keep going.
[53:42.02]There's gotta be more crazier mo- No.
[53:45.20]I really do think that the zombie is so evergreen that you don't ever need to innovate on it.
[53:51.36]They just they needed a cool down.
[53:57.26]And they were not willing to take a cooldown.
[54:01.57]It's like imagine if we're like innovating the wheel.
[54:03.54]Right?
[54:04.54]The wheel is the wheel.
[54:06.53]Look at the most recent Call of Duty campaign.
[54:08.66]It is like this level of dog shit.
[54:10.75]They need to not make a Call of Duty for like four years and then make a good one.
[54:15.25]Yeah.
[54:18.22]You played this game four times while acting like you're seeing this new.
[54:22.52]You missed the beginning of the stream.
[54:28.65]This is a different campaign.
[54:30.33]I played the Leon campaign.
[54:33.36]And Resident Evil 9's coming out and I wanted to showcase the franchise to Ster by showing him the worst possible video game that released in this franchise.
[54:42.43]This is kind of getting me hyped for 9.
[54:45.32]I hope it's like this.
[54:51.38]I actually, I'm unironically using this to find out where to go.
[54:56.22]Alright, I found it.
[55:00.82]Resident Evil Survivor is worse, is it?
[55:14.64]Oh shit.
[55:16.54]I tried to jump, it didn't work.
[55:21.10]Alright, uh, there's still another hostage.
[55:29.49]I've seen you play most of these games.
[55:30.65]I'm enjoying this one by far the most.
[55:33.95]That's a lie.
[55:37.87]Resident Evil 4 is one of my favorite games of all time.
[55:40.66]And I played it.
[55:42.13]That was so great.
[55:43.09]This is not better than that.
[55:47.37]All hostages on the 15th floor secured.
[55:49.95]Leaving the building now.
[55:51.66]We both have to go to the bathroom really bad.
[55:56.11]Oh, dude, are you sure?
[55:57.28]Is it, okay, it's up here on the left.
[55:59.15]Is it right here on the left or do we have to walk like 300, 400 feet?
[56:02.56]God damn it.
[56:06.73]Oh, fuck.
[56:07.59]Okay.
[56:11.07]and get through the ceiling if you give me a hand.
[56:29.38]Later.
[56:38.48]Help me.
[56:41.74]Do you prefer the original or the... Alright, there's no world where we don't liquify.
[56:51.46]Dude, why won't they?
[56:54.96]They need to subvert the expectations, you know what I mean?
[56:57.65]Liquify the both of us and change it over to like Ada's campaign.
[57:01.29]And it's like, holy... What the fuck just happened?
[57:07.68]I don't think I can get over there.
[57:09.11]We're supposed to open this door together.
[57:10.98]I can't... Who the fuck is still shooting?
[57:14.99]Can I not...
[57:15.70]I can't roll over to you?
[57:19.04]What?
[57:19.92]I'm fine.
[57:26.63]How do I even get over to you?
[57:31.12]Oh, I have to pull my side.
[57:40.47]They're kind of getting a feeling we're not welcome here.
[57:45.29]Come on, we can take them!
[57:50.81]Got it.
[58:02.27]This is the cover tutorial where they force you to be in cover.
[58:05.96]Oh, you're not doing it.
[58:07.23]You're not cool.
[58:08.07]Oh, you're doing it.
[58:08.87]I feel like Resident Evil the team made this for game jam in 4 days.
[58:14.78]We really wanted to participate in that game jam that was happening, the 48-hour Halloween game jam.
[58:21.27]on itch.io.
[58:22.84]We wanted to participate this year.
[58:25.32]I'm gonna die.
[58:29.86]Oh my god, those flashbangs are so annoying.
[58:32.07]You threw that, didn't you?
[58:33.02]No, I didn't.
[58:33.98]That guy just did a backflip and that was crazy.
[58:43.14]I need to cover.
[58:43.73]No, you idiot.
[58:46.84]Why are you covering?
[58:47.56]I don't...
[58:49.05]There's people...
[58:54.11]Did I just jump over the cover with the same button?
[59:00.18]Can I drink the soup?
[59:01.64]Is that not soup?
[59:03.19]You can't drink the soup.
[59:04.08]That's absolute dog shit.
[59:06.41]I should be able to grab that with two hands and like... With a really disgusting animation.
[59:11.75]They missed the... What a ball drop on that, huh?
[59:15.89]Miserable.
[59:18.16]They didn't have time in the game jam
[59:22.60]I don't know what's going on.
[59:25.61]Ooh, I need that.
[59:26.87]No, get out of this fucking menu!
[59:46.49]Through the table.
[59:48.97]Awww.
[59:51.42]Unfortunate.
[59:57.43]Oh no, you're dead.
[59:58.81]Did I get bored?
[60:00.38]I didn't die.
[60:01.16]You have a first aid kit.
[60:04.29]Your weapon is gigantic.
[60:07.27]Yeah?
[60:08.21]Let me see that thing!
[60:10.57]That thing is huge!
[60:14.36]I punched you.
[60:16.23]Let me see your weapon.
[60:17.56]I broke my arm!
[60:20.45]That other one.
[60:21.91]That is not... Is that really how big that is?
[60:25.43]Yeah.
[60:26.21]I need the 50 cal.
[60:30.13]I feel like that's too big.
[60:31.26]Oh, for your little arms?
[60:35.87]Your little arms can't pick it up?
[60:38.65]Alright, there's another hostage in here.
[60:41.22]When do we get to get skills?
[60:42.37]We're gonna keep getting all these skill points.
[60:44.20]I don't know.
[60:48.49]This is Delta One.
[60:49.80]I'm clear of the building.
[60:51.90]HQ here.
[60:52.41]Copy that.
[60:55.27]The music is too epic too.
[60:57.87]This is late stage Resident Evil.
[60:59.78]The music won't stop.
[61:02.72]The conductor is sweating right now and his hair is greasy.
[61:16.37]Alright, down here.
[61:17.97]Watch out.
[61:22.71]Hey wait, don't go down.
[61:23.67]Don't?
[61:24.59]I got this.
[61:29.45]What are you doing?
[61:31.60]Trying to...
[61:39.01]That hurt me a lot.
[61:40.14]I mean, I think... Oh, dude, that was the hostage.
[61:54.19]What do we do?
[61:59.06]How do we like pick her up?
[62:03.75]I don't know.
[62:04.84]There's an indicator on her.
[62:07.61]I think it's confused because...
[62:10.34]I don't know.
[62:20.68]I think that's an unfailable QTE.
[62:31.33]We got you, Susan.
[62:35.47]Alright, how awesome would it be if you could play as this character?
[62:40.83]A Susan?
[62:41.89]Dude, that's a Resident Evil game I want to play.
[62:44.97]Is every like 30 to 40 minutes, you have to switch to a different person.
[62:49.67]because you play as like a regular guy.
[62:51.96]Oh, Watch Dogs Legion?
[62:54.18]No, no, no, no, no.
[62:58.72]Resident Evil Susan.
[63:04.53]Shit, we're trapped.
[63:05.75]What the hell do we do now?
[63:08.99]Don't worry, my little button tells me to go this way.
[63:14.53]I just push...
[63:16.24]I just push my button.
[63:17.40]I push my little button and it says, go over there.
[63:22.42]It's this way.
[63:26.49]Oh, in here.
[63:29.12]Get out of there.
[63:34.20]Don't bomb the building before we get out.
[63:43.57]It'd be so great to like go back 20 years or whatever, how long play Resident Evil 1.
[63:52.88]And then a genie is like, we'll let you play Resident Evil 6 now.
[63:58.33]You would be the most confused sort of sad person, I think.
[64:04.11]Resident Evil 1 is still a banger, by the way.
[64:05.75]You played a good one.
[64:16.69]Wait, you can't walk over that?
[64:25.41]Yes, you can.
[64:31.87]Everything's... it's too epic!
[64:35.00]What?
[64:37.79]Oh, I press every button.
[64:41.79]Why wouldn't you help me?
[64:42.91]I don't know, my guy wouldn't move.
[64:48.42]Captain!
[64:49.67]Watch out, over here!
[64:50.39]To the left, to the left, left, left, left, right, right!
[64:52.71]They're all around us!
[64:57.67]Ha ha ha ha ha!
[65:02.63]Go back far.
[65:09.38]It's not that bad, right?
[65:10.86]Is it that far?
[65:12.74]I think it's just up and around the hole again.
[65:15.21]Oh, my fucking game crashed.
[65:19.67]I crashed a desktop.
[65:21.68]God damn it.
[65:23.75]It was worth it.
[65:24.61]We had to fuck around that much, man.
[65:26.38]Hold on.
[65:27.60]God, the screen shake.
[65:34.02]shit I can't get I I I guess I just leave the screen shake is too much to look at you're gonna have to leave
[65:49.34]I'm in the menu trying to leave and the ceiling fell and crushed them again.
[65:53.56]Wait, me?
[65:54.66]It crushed me again.
[65:55.81]Yeah.
[65:57.87]It wasn't even me.
[66:01.98]Okay.
[66:03.19]I'm back in the game.
[66:12.25]It's been the, hold on.
[66:14.95]hubby said this intro has been the exact same level of intensity as the last five minutes of any other Resident Evil like it's just not calming down
[66:23.97]Yeah, there's a, what's the, it's a law in media where you do a big bang, you slow it down,
[66:30.23]You come to the crescendo, you wave it, you go up the mountain, you climb down the hill.
[66:35.37]You know what I'm saying?
[66:37.82]You don't just take drugs and scream.
[66:41.77]But I feel like that's kinda, a lot of games have gotten there.
[66:45.25]It's just, oh dude, so it's gonna take crack?
[66:48.38]And just scream as loud as we can.
[66:50.29]No, we don't want to bore the players.
[66:53.26]We can't bore them.
[66:55.59]They're going to get bored and they're going to leave.
[66:59.27]Alright, let me get the audio.
[67:11.72]I really hope we're not that far back.
[67:13.70]I think we're really far back.
[67:21.37]I mean, we should be playing on a harder difficulty, so we have to do it like four times.
[67:26.48]Steam incoming.
[67:39.25]Alright, let's move.
[67:45.89]Oh, God damn it.
[67:47.98]I don't know how far this is because every single area is the same.
[67:50.98]Oh, my God.
[67:52.44]Okay, we have to speedrun this.
[67:54.65]Just be quiet in speedrun and just play in speedrun as fast as we can.
[67:58.01]Yeah, I'm going to be quiet.
[67:59.66]I'm not saying one word.
[68:21.97]Do we even have to kill them or can we just like...
[68:24.06]I think we just run by.
[68:25.21]The only ones who have to kill are the ones with the hostages.
[68:33.19]Alright, this way.
[68:42.52]Down.
[68:45.67]Ain't got no ammo.
[68:49.59]Ammo down here.
[68:50.85]Maybe.
[68:53.08]Clear comms.
[68:56.99]That fucking annihilates me!
[69:15.97]Who cares?
[69:16.35]Don't fight the random dickheads.
[69:19.89]Just get loot.
[69:20.39]He has it coming.
[69:21.07]He has it coming.
[69:24.91]Good.
[69:29.08]Here we go, spiders.
[69:40.53]Alright, squad move up.

[69:50.72]Roger that.
[69:51.83]Roger.
[69:54.85]Alright, try to unload immediately so we can get them both in one.
[69:57.24]Go and go here.
[69:59.27]Okay.
[70:00.78]Thanks.
[70:01.12]That was great.

[70:36.44]In.
[70:38.32]I think you ran through the grenade.
[70:42.86]Yep.
[70:53.51]This game reminds me of EDF, but without the jokes.
[70:57.14]Yeah, it does.
[70:59.81]Where the hell is this guy?
[71:04.87]Oh my god, you stupid asshole.
[71:13.37]Okay, this way.
[71:20.97]That actually got me.
[71:21.99]Nice job, Capcom.

[71:33.51]Down.
[71:38.01]Yeah, if you could, like, not crash this time.
[71:40.63]Well, I ran at the exit.
[71:43.06]I know that was so bad.
[71:52.12]Make sure you're picking up loot.
[71:57.07]I'm not.
[72:00.08]We're gonna be so underleveled for the next stage, dude.
[72:05.23]Alright, this way.

[72:41.00]I can get through the ceiling if you give me a hand.
[72:47.87]was this guy ever in anything else or did they just kind of create him and this is it I probably die at the end I was gonna say he probably dies at the end of this campaign
[72:58.37]You're right.
[73:03.32]Okay, be careful.
[73:12.07]Oh, you got him.
[73:18.11]Yeah, why do they turn into like ash when they die?
[73:20.14]Get the loot behind you.
[73:22.01]Is it because they were mold?
[73:24.46]No, that's a different storyline.
[73:27.32]Isn't that all the storylines?
[73:28.88]No.
[73:31.95]The first three games are a virus, the second three games are a parasite, and the last few games have been mold.
[73:43.34]what but why I don't know but I don't know I didn't make the game I'm going in
[74:00.28]Nice dude.
[74:11.08]They can't come down the hallway.
[74:14.99]Oh my god.
[74:24.31]Good Good I thought that was you
[74:34.39]One of the enemies.
[74:35.82]They need to have a gigantic red or yellow indicator around their characters.
[74:40.72]that just says friend yeah or enemy it should say enemy um above them and then this should be tab targeting yeah
[74:56.36]Well, I have so much shit.
[75:01.48]No, don't- Why would there even be a throwaway button in this menu?
[75:06.23]No.
[75:16.59]What?
[75:18.26]Are you trying to use the heal?
[75:19.45]Yeah.
[75:20.84]You press 1 when you're not in the menu.
[75:25.10]No, it's okay.
[75:26.02]There it is.
[75:28.42]Bro, you crashing out?
[75:29.46]Yes!
[75:33.75]Hey man, this was your idea.
[75:38.77]This is Delta One.
[75:40.12]I'm clear of the building.
[75:42.07]I'm having fun.
[75:43.87]Open it faster, you fucking idiot.
[75:49.95]I'm sorry.
[75:51.30]Double tap space.
[75:53.82]Alright, we're both not going to save this hostage.
[75:58.37]We need to see what happens.
[76:01.07]Oh god, if it fails and we go back to the beginning...
[76:04.31]Ah, that's true.
[76:07.38]Never mind.
[76:13.92]You're right.
[76:20.16]First floor hostage secured.
[76:22.56]They had to have a voice line here of like, why?
[76:26.93]Thank you, gentlemen.
[76:28.27]Thank the both of you.
[76:29.78]If it wasn't for you, I could have been eaten by those monsters.
[76:33.54]Did they know anything about this franchise?
[76:36.06]And she goes on for like two full minutes and tells you about all her grandkids.
[76:40.66]Alright, we actually don't blow it here.
[76:42.39]We have to just do this.
[76:44.16]Shit ground shaking HQ to alpha
[76:50.77]Uh huh.
[77:02.30]Get out of there now!
[77:04.70]Preparations to bomb the building are complete.
[77:06.89]Planes have been scrambled.
[77:08.36]We don't want to be here when those birds show up.
[77:11.83]Look out!
[77:16.97]Shit!
[77:18.23]The ground shakes!
[77:19.44]The ground is shaking!
[77:24.35]Wait, oh no.
[77:25.84]Oh, up?
[77:27.49]Up.
[77:28.97]Third floor.
[77:30.12]Don't let the ceiling fall on your head.
[77:31.74]You'll crash.
[77:34.41]Okay, actually don't screw this up.
[77:39.19]Why did that just happen?
[77:41.96]What just happened?
[77:44.10]Why did I get crushed?
[77:46.04]I don't know.
[77:48.79]No way, dude.
[77:49.53]We're not going all the way back.
[77:51.60]Okay, thank God.
[77:54.59]Were we not fast enough?
[77:55.38]I think because we took that wrong turn at first.
[78:00.36]We wasted time, maybe?
[78:02.89]but this whole place it doesn't like I I can't control my aim we go left up the stairs items all the way down left
[78:16.12]Oh my god, my character did such a wide turn.
[78:26.11]Captain, I think we can get around it.
[78:37.42]Come on, do it.
[78:39.48]Oh, I fell.
[78:45.55]My character will not move.
[78:46.92]None of my buttons do anything.
[78:48.16]I just watch.
[78:52.90]Okay.
[78:56.39]We did it.
[78:59.08]And I have to pee so bad.
[79:00.51]Can we take another pee break?
[79:04.88]Yeah, let me help you with that.
[79:07.19]Yeah, you can go peek.
[79:32.91]This is disgusting Chris Redfield every time he has a thought
[79:42.31]It's the chip they implanted in his brain, dude.
[79:48.22]Oh, I wish it wasn't that loud.
[79:58.00]okay that's a lot of money we got a lot of gold okay I got 61 accuracy you got
[80:07.13]Here's the thing about my accuracy, though.
[80:09.16]A rank and C rank.
[80:10.59]How does that work?
[80:11.71]Well, remember, I was shooting like as a joke a bunch of times.
[80:15.13]Remember you were like, why are you doing that as a joke?
[80:17.08]I was unloading and random things and missing and stuff.
[80:23.48]Oh wait, I got an S and you got a B. Yeah, that's fine though.
[80:27.95]Yeah, that's fine.
[80:29.28]I'm okay with that.
[80:30.04]I love how there's an end game.
[80:33.77]Wait.
[80:35.30]Why do I have a 60 second countdown?
[80:39.49]more quarters to play the next arcade mission we can purchase new skills now
[80:49.84]Uh...
[80:51.73]Some of these are way too expensive.
[80:54.86]Sniper scope thing?
[80:59.53]Keeps your partner from helping you when you're in single player.
[81:02.26]That's weird.
[81:04.00]What the heck is a Javo?
[81:06.83]This one, we don't even know what that one is.
[81:10.51]Oh, there's a bunch we don't know.
[81:12.30]Dude, item drops?
[81:13.16]Yup.
[81:17.52]I'll take that one.
[81:23.12]How do I use it?
[81:26.23]It looks like you go equip three.
[81:27.96]Oh, you have to hit by the way you have to hit R to equip it.
[81:33.19]I'm broke.
[81:35.22]Alright, I gotta pee.
[81:36.32]I'll be back in two minutes.
[81:39.92]You gonna go take a break too?
[81:43.82]Let's count down those two minutes and see if it's for real.
[81:53.02]Okay, never mind if you're going to move the goalpost.
[81:55.01]Yeah, I can't even afford anything.
[82:09.79]Well, guess it's just us now.
[82:13.33]Alright, okay, guess it's just us.
[82:17.66]Alright, give us your wisdom.
[82:21.99]A penny saved is a penny earned.
[82:35.61]Yep.
[82:38.27]Something controversial and inappropriate.
[82:43.54]Uh, I'm still on the thing that, uh...
[82:49.06]Cheesecake is a pie.
[82:51.93]I really feel like that didn't resonate with people and I have to say it again.
[83:02.61]Am I actually not muted on Jerma's stream?
[83:06.20]That's a first.
[83:19.08]He's going to miss the cut scene.
[84:51.91]Guys, I'm sorry, I'm deeply engaged in this story.
[85:02.80]I hope Finn makes it.
[85:05.41]Is he always this?
[85:06.80]Six is that doing walks away.
[85:11.72]The timer ran out and the cutscene just started.
[85:16.09]There just was a timer in that screen.
[85:19.27]I don't know a different world.
[85:22.84]It's still Earth.
[85:24.83]Come in, HQ.
[85:26.18]We're taking fire at the two of hearts.
[85:28.03]Engaging the enemy.
[85:29.51]Copy that.
[85:30.20]Keep an eye out for those powered-up soldiers.
[85:44.32]I'm afraid we can't offer you any assistance.
[85:46.83]Copy that.
[85:47.60]We'll do it alone then.
[85:52.36]I don't know.
[85:53.51]Just shoot everyone.
[86:01.35]What the heck is that thing?
[86:17.72]They're in the machine gun tower.
[86:21.98]We need a sniper to do the saving private Ryan.
[86:30.11]Holy shit, I've been muted on my stream the whole time.
[86:32.64]Alright, hey.
[86:33.20]Since the very beginning.
[86:36.33]You're the sniper!
[86:37.61]Get that guy!
[86:40.92]I can't.
[86:41.69]I don't think I can get up to it.
[86:42.71]It's time to crack a fucking bush light.
[86:45.16]You know what I'm saying?
[86:47.93]I actually don't want to do this in front of the microphone.
[86:49.79]It's gonna be like annoying.
[86:52.36]What, snort of bush?
[86:54.68]Ow.
[86:57.01]Now that's got the real fuckin' American light beer flavor that I come to love.
[87:07.65]Dude.
[87:10.59]Leave me alone.
[87:11.51]Hold on, I have to play 1, 2, 3.
[87:16.78]Huh.
[87:22.93]I'm so angry over that.
[87:24.88]I don't know if I can hit him.
[87:26.08]Hit him!
[87:30.16]You're the sniper.
[87:40.83]Okay, cover behind the trucks.
[87:42.57]Yep.
[87:47.07]Where is he?
[87:47.82]I think he's dead.
[87:48.48]Did you get him?
[87:50.28]No.
[87:56.66]I'm unsure if I was allowed to shoot him or not.
[88:02.48]Nice cover, idiot.
[88:04.01]Get your neck snapped.
[88:06.51]Jesus, that's...
[88:15.69]These guys are like vampires in the sun.
[88:18.08]God.
[88:21.68]This takes an unbelievable amount of core strength to do what I'm doing right now.
[88:25.23]Of course, it's Chris Redfield doing it.
[88:31.91]What?
[88:33.81]That guy, that was weird.
[88:41.02]Why do I feel like this level is going to be the exact same as the last level other than the environment?
[88:46.05]You'd be right.
[88:50.76]Oh.
[88:53.01]Now don't let this ruin your image of Resident Evil.
[88:56.22]It's a gun indicator.
[88:57.09]Don't let this ruin your image of Resident Evil.
[88:59.30]It's a great game.
[89:00.48]It's a wonderful franchise.
[89:02.41]Very excited for Resident Evil 9 coming soon in February.
[89:05.95]That game has Leon Kennedy as one of the main characters.
[89:09.65]He's coming back.
[89:11.09]So if you're a fan of Leon Kennedy or gigantic monsters like this.
[89:15.83]Attack on Titan.
[89:17.33]It's like a Warcraft 3 enemy.
[89:29.98]They won't let Leon retire.
[89:31.82]My prediction is that this is the last game Leon's going to be in.
[89:38.04]Alright, hit the big boulder on his back.
[89:40.94]And duck.
[89:42.87]He's throwing trucks.
[89:51.26]My controls work like 5% of the time.
[89:53.97]Do I not have any bullets?
[89:57.46]What happens if he gets too close?
[90:03.37]Oh, I think it was scripted.
[90:07.21]Uh, my prediction is this little... Yeah, Leon.
[90:09.02]We have to run.
[90:13.43]Oh shit, this point of view, Capcom does it again.
[90:16.12]Dragon's Dogma ending, anyone?
[90:17.81]Wow, this is insane.
[90:29.90]Oh, he's coming!
[90:41.51]Yeah, I just E3 walked his ass.
[90:45.34]He thinks he's tough.
[90:49.12]There's permanent screen shake at all times, I know.
[90:58.47]He doesn't really seem that dangerous.
[91:02.42]Kind of lovable.
[91:05.08]Yeah, that screen shake is not even a shake.
[91:06.89]It's more of an eye vibration.
[91:12.69]I don't think we're supposed to come down to ground level.
[91:25.01]This is so hard to look at.
[91:27.41]This guy sucks.
[91:34.04]He's going crazy mode.
[91:35.93]I don't have any bolts left.
[91:44.94]I'm going to play Night Rain.
[91:55.27]Wait, ammo.
[91:56.92]Oh, we're good, we're good.
[92:02.65]I'm telling you, this is just EDF.
[92:05.73]Minus the jokes.
[92:09.77]Okay, there's a...
[92:15.84]You just can't view that.
[92:17.25]Excuse me.
[92:17.98]It's Chris Redfield you're driving into.
[92:20.62]Punk.
[92:23.57]They're giving them new stuff.
[92:25.08]They can make any kind of freak show they want.
[92:33.53]I'm so sorry, Commander.
[92:34.59]I didn't know it was you.
[92:35.41]I thought it was a zombie.
[92:38.83]I thought you were one of those monsters out there.
[92:44.07]GET BEHIND IT!
[92:52.43]Why is the pickup item button the same as reload?
[92:55.40]So I fire one button, pick up an item and then reload.
[92:58.59]I'm trying to get to that box so bad.
[93:02.91]Jimmy Stewart plays Resident Evil?
[93:05.46]Now I understand something.
[93:08.08]I want to tell you.
[93:10.75]If we're going to fly President Evil together...
[93:17.98]I want to be Chris Radfield.
[93:20.49]You understand?
[93:21.03]You're that fellow there, Pierce.
[93:27.75]I always play as Chris Bradford.
[93:32.73]And by the way, it's a wonderful life.
[93:35.44]It's a wonderful life.
[93:38.01]I don't know what's going on with you.
[93:49.18]Yeah, right.
[93:50.24]I got that guy like five times.
[93:52.90]That game had to load that I shot him.
[93:55.81]And it won't even let me finish him off.
[94:03.18]Just checking the back.
[94:09.73]suplexing them.
[94:11.82]Can you do a Jimmy Stewart impression for me, please?
[94:15.16]I don't know who that is.
[94:16.11]All you have to do is this.
[94:19.44]Try that.
[94:22.69]Does he very specifically say his own name?
[94:25.40]Yes.
[94:26.67]It's me, Jimmy Stewart.
[94:30.27]That was not good.
[94:32.14]I don't know who it is.
[94:34.03]That was not good.
[94:35.41]oh it's me Jimmy Stewart I blow the car and clear a path
[94:45.27]I feel like that guy did that.
[94:48.64]And then I'm going to blame him.
[94:50.70]cover Finn McCauley.
[94:52.82]I'm dying.
[94:53.52]Random guy that...
[94:55.44]Wait.
[94:55.80]Why did it give me two things to do?
[94:59.12]What the hell was that?
[95:00.09]It was V or 1?
[95:02.82]Yeah, V is like the punch me in the chest one.
[95:05.26]I think use your healing items on me.
[95:06.77]I don't really know
[95:08.10]I feel like I died in the cutscene.
[95:09.79]I just walked forward to where it explodes.
[95:13.93]Yeah, I did.
[95:15.75]Can you do Johnny Carson?
[95:17.41]Okay, no, that's the rocket launcher guy shooting me.
[95:20.03]After a while.
[95:20.79]Wow, that is weird.
[95:22.40]That's wild stuff.
[95:23.83]That was weird.
[95:25.11]That was wild stuff.
[95:26.56]I tell you.
[95:27.44]Yeah.
[95:27.81]Yeah.
[95:27.93]Wild.
[95:38.51]Give me another one.
[95:39.03]This had to go so hard if you had an N64 controller with a vibrator in it.
[95:56.21]Dude, we only have so much time before... What's his name?
[96:00.11]Finn the dog and Jake the human, whatever it is.
[96:01.90]What is it?
[96:02.74]Oh, he's over there.
[96:03.30]There's a collectible.
[96:07.06]Wait, couldn't the humans in this?
[96:12.91]I'm Jimmy Ch- Oh, I...
[96:29.49]That guy could just turn around and...
[96:31.02]Wait, are we... A lot of guys showed up.
[96:32.89]That's a lot of guys.
[96:40.90]That actually was a perfect flashbang.
[96:43.21]Let's see whose is better.
[96:45.51]We're both pretty good.
[96:51.83]What are these Devil May Cry enemies?
[96:59.40]Nice try, dickhead.
[97:05.87]Uh, that guy has a rocket launcher.
[97:07.22]Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster, Ster.
[97:08.60]I got him.
[97:15.27]If you knew, you wouldn't be able to aim at it.
[97:17.66]I've shot him like five.
[97:22.27]I've shot him like five times already.
[97:34.34]Dude, this is crazy.
[97:39.41]When does it let up?
[97:41.28]Uh, I have no more.
[97:42.30]That guy...
[97:44.95]Uh oh.
[97:50.11]Uh, can you help me?
[97:54.34]I think you saved us by putting us in a cutscene.
[98:02.66]We gotta head back.
[98:04.31]Why are the zombies trash-talking me?
[98:08.30]Hurry up!
[98:09.02]Get back!
[98:09.98]It gets worse the whole game.
[98:13.04]Does it get worse or does it stay the same?
[98:17.78]I feel like we're getting footage for the trailer for the game.
[98:29.22]It feels like we're stuck in a trailer gameplay world.
[98:34.54]Like, this is the first time the music has not been on.
[98:36.76]Yeah, I mean, that's all I'm asking.
[98:40.39]Like this is the universe you go into to get the footage for the game's trailer.
[98:50.51]Oh, the zombie tank.
[99:05.13]They really figured it out in future games where it's just like...
[99:08.17]I just want to fight giant fish.
[99:09.95]Doing my Resident Evil tier list.
[99:12.23]Okay, yeah, of course, we got one, two, three, four is so good.
[99:15.67]Four is going in.
[99:16.45]He's just naming them in order.
[99:19.14]Five.
[99:19.28]Then we get to six.
[99:20.10]Oh, we don't talk about six.
[99:21.83]We don't talk about six.
[99:23.57]Oh, one, two, three, four.
[99:24.43]No, let's not do that one.
[99:26.44]We don't talk about sex because it's it oh no oops, but let's I'll show you my two is my favorite How do I get over there?
[99:35.25]I don't know, you threw me over here.
[99:36.72]I think I have to go this way.
[99:41.13]We might be split up now.
[99:44.57]Uh...
[99:46.88]Is this supposed to happen?
[99:49.70]I thought that was Chris saying that.
[99:53.55]Like, whoa, he turned into a little wuss real quick.
[100:01.83]Help!
[100:04.40]Aw, nice one, Finn.
[100:14.23]We're gonna lose, Ben.
[100:15.82]We're gonna lose me.
[100:18.46]Yeah, where are you?
[100:21.44]I'm in the tunnels!
[100:22.56]I don't know!
[100:23.28]Well, do whatever you need to do and finish it now.
[100:26.67]Destroy the tank.
[100:27.78]Now.
[100:29.40]Do it.
[100:30.73]Now.
[100:32.91]I'm not moving until you do it.
[100:37.79]I actually... Oh my god, I'm gonna die.
[100:44.99]What was that?
[100:46.74]Dude, this game's menu is un-fucking-believable.
[100:50.08]I just was trying to... Finn!
[100:56.91]Finn!
[100:57.45]I feel like you're supposed to be here Finn!
[101:02.12]And rescue my... What the fuck?
[101:13.53]Okay, let's go.
[101:15.50]I'll get there before you do.
[101:19.85]There's a lot of guys in here.
[101:21.30]So you probably will.
[101:35.57]What's up, tank?
[101:40.06]this guy just grew bigger legs bro what just happened?
[101:48.73]When you get shot by the tank, my screen becomes like seeing you on the ground.
[102:02.65]Alright, I think you have to do something.
[102:05.62]Yeah!
[102:06.73]I don't know!
[102:08.83]I don't know!
[102:09.57]I'm trying to get through these... How do you crouch?
[102:12.20]How do you crouch in this shit game?
[102:29.26]You're using this cover like an absolute moron!
[102:47.57]Is there anything going on for you out there?
[102:49.62]I mean, I'm just trying not to die.
[102:51.06]I'm just killing people.
[102:53.87]I think I'm trying to get like behind the tank.
[102:58.71]He's a ledger!
[103:05.98]Not up, y'all.
[103:11.59]That guy's sniping me.
[103:12.91]He's got a sniper rifle.
[103:14.95]Where?
[103:15.87]Got him, don't worry.
[103:17.20]I'm gonna need a bigger gun.
[103:19.72]I'm out of bullets!
[103:31.96]and draw the tank out of position.
[103:40.24]A thermal scope?
[103:41.48]What is... What am I doing?
[103:43.03]Alright, he's coming, he's coming, he's coming.
[103:45.22]Oh, fuck!
[103:47.71]Oh, I see.
[103:48.79]No, don't die, don't die, don't die, don't die.
[103:53.96]I think I'm alright.
[103:55.83]Oh, fuck.
[103:57.01]Not good.
[104:01.84]Well, he keeps saying I don't...
[104:06.77]Yeah, I know.
[104:13.23]You need to lure that you're walking so far.
[104:14.96]We need to lure the tank forward.
[104:16.68]I'll lure the tank.
[104:24.39]And then I think I shoot the explosive truck behind it when I move.
[104:27.48]Captain, you draw the tank out of position.
[104:32.12]I can take care of that truck.
[104:36.52]Alright, come on, let's go tank.
[104:47.62]Dude.
[104:53.95]Dude, this guy's hand is shaking.
[104:59.27]Can you take out the snipers that are attacking me?
[105:02.04]I'm trying.
[105:05.78]Alright, here he comes.
[105:09.36]You get it?
[105:11.30]Nice shooting, Piers.
[105:12.69]Nice job.
[105:14.50]Way's clear.
[105:15.34]Better catch up with Captain Redfield.
[105:19.70]I need bullets.
[105:20.76]Bad.
[105:32.97]Alright.
[105:33.49]Are you here?
[105:35.24]No.
[105:36.41]It's clear.
[105:36.92]I'm doing something else.
[105:46.16]You are so far away.
[105:47.37]When was the last time you had a Cherry Coke?
[105:52.34]But never.
[105:53.59]What?
[105:56.71]What do you mean, never?
[105:57.47]When's the last time you had a peach tea?
[106:00.33]Uh, many times.
[106:00.90]It's wonderful.
[106:01.80]You've never had a cherry cocoa your whole life?
[106:03.49]I am not a coke drinker.
[106:05.92]But ever?
[106:08.29]But yeah, ever.
[106:10.42]How?
[106:13.80]Sorry.
[106:14.37]I've had PhD in the last few months.
[106:21.63]Yeah, I mean, you're talking to Mr.
[106:22.87]Tea, man.
[106:23.36]I drink a lot of tea.
[106:26.41]Are you really going to take that from Mike Tyson?
[106:28.92]I like green tea.
[106:30.31]I like peach tea.
[106:34.00]Well, I'm Mr. Whatever.
[106:38.55]What is Mr. T's real name?
[106:40.80]Does he have a name?
[106:42.58]I don't know.
[106:43.44]This probably starts with T. Or his last name probably starts with T.
[106:53.83]Finally, you decided to show up.
[107:02.56]What does the T stand for?
[107:04.60]I don't know.
[107:06.79]I never really looked into it.
[107:09.66]They were just like, he was just Mr. T, and I was like, okay, yeah.
[107:17.41]Is there a Mrs. T?
[107:20.22]I dunno.
[107:23.98]His legal name is Mr. T.
[107:26.97]I knocked that ladder down for you.
[107:30.13]I don't care.
[107:31.90]Hey, I wasn't paying attention very much.
[107:33.03]Can you catch me up on the story?
[107:34.25]Yeah, sure.
[107:36.54]Captain!
[107:39.47]Chris!
[107:46.90]That's all I've gotten so far.
[107:55.86]And Jerma wants to beat all of it.
[107:58.17]I didn't say that.
[108:00.40]You did.
[108:00.81]You said you want to do everything, no matter how long it takes.
[108:04.02]Did I say that?
[108:06.21]No.
[108:07.23]The other day?
[108:08.19]I did?
[108:08.96]That doesn't sound like me.
[108:16.47]Okay.
[108:16.83]I mean, I'm not going to like push it.
[108:18.90]Hold our positions for now.
[108:22.68]I don't care if you have to drag him.
[108:24.01]Stay here.
[108:25.01]You said that this stream.
[108:26.95]I think I was probably just joking around.
[108:29.85]Well, apparently you've been saying it for like over multiple days to multiple different people.
[108:34.04]Well...
[108:35.20]Did you laugh?
[108:38.15]Oh, you laugh you lose.
[108:43.84]What is that?
[108:46.26]They're airdropping behind you?
[108:48.39]What?
[108:48.93]I think that's our guys.
[108:50.74]no zombies are parachuting in with machine guns
[108:59.55]They really thought people just got sick of the...
[109:05.85]Which is never the case, man.
[109:11.58]Zombies in multimedia is the same to me as like a sword being in an ARPG.
[109:16.64]Oh no, you can't have that.
[109:18.71]Put guns in.
[109:20.50]A longsword in an RPG is the same thing as a zombie to me.
[109:24.27]Yeah, of course, it's going to be in anything.
[109:26.08]It's evergreen completely.
[109:28.60]No.
[109:29.93]Put guns and dragons in.
[109:35.53]Did you play any of the new Call of Duty?
[109:39.80]I was going to until I heard that, like, I love a bad game, but then I heard it was AI bad game and I didn't want to do it.
[109:45.79]Wow.
[109:56.18]That guy just ran into his teammates.
[109:57.76]That guy has leg pads.
[110:03.08]Oh, you haven't noticed any of the leg pad mutants?
[110:05.70]I mean, maybe.
[110:07.32]Just in case you've been shooting zombies in the leg this whole time, they finally found a counter.
[110:12.99]I shot that guy's clothes off.
[110:15.14]What is going on?
[110:16.97]Is this the new Soul Calibur?
[110:20.72]They do look like Soul Calibur characters, you're right.
[110:25.26]Ster, what is this from?
[110:26.24]It's been in my head like every so often.
[110:29.49]What is that?
[110:38.89]I don't know.
[110:39.80]Yeah, you have to.
[110:42.99]It's dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[110:45.63]It's from Soul Calibur.
[110:49.00]I don't know which one I'm unclear on any of the words you're saying
[110:58.06]Are these supposed to be English?
[111:01.02]Dude, I'm dead.
[111:04.79]Let me help you, let me help you.
[111:07.24]Here, take these!
[111:08.09]Take these!
[111:09.25]I'm... What?
[111:14.49]Your guy!
[111:16.79]He did not like what I just gave him.
[111:20.60]He's like...
[111:26.97]Oh no, this guy grew big legs and a shield.
[111:33.03]They do jumping kicks!
[111:41.65]That is a fucking insane amount of times.
[111:49.50]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun.
[111:52.39]Soul Calibur 2.
[111:53.58]Come on, dude.
[111:58.98]I thought you were doing like Kiss of a Rose, is it?
[112:02.62]I don't think you dare.
[112:11.18]Actually, Jeremiah, you and Stuart need to stop talking shit about this game because
[112:16.51]This is lore accurate.
[112:17.66]This is the reason why they've always tried to do the viruses and the parasites.
[112:22.10]to make it so people weren't zombies and they could become big super soldiers and unkillable and stuff.
[112:27.55]So this is exactly the type of game that it needed to become.
[112:32.11]Yes, I have 500 hours on Steam in this game.
[112:34.08]I've played through it 14 times.
[112:44.73]That's crazy.
[112:50.92]If you don't understand the lore of why they can do this, then you don't deserve to be a Resident Evil fan.
[112:56.37]They actually timed that person out.
[112:57.61]That's fucking annoying.
[112:59.80]I think we're going back to Finn.
[113:09.05]I hope Chris has another thought.
[113:15.11]How do you guys need to seriously shut the fuck up over here?
[113:16.84]It's so fucking aggravating.
[113:19.64]Like, oh yeah, okay.
[113:21.13]I don't, because I'm not paying attention to the lore means that I can't play the game.
[113:24.60]Shut the fuck up.
[113:25.44]Mods actually start doing what you need to do here.
[113:28.29]Just gonna piss me off.
[113:34.97]Shoot it!
[113:43.20]Nobody said that.
[113:43.81]Yeah, scroll up.
[113:47.07]I'm getting really uncomfortable
[113:59.01]Yeah, you're just in here.
[114:01.61]Yeah, just quiet in the room, looking left and right, like, ah.
[114:10.20]Like, ah, yeah.
[114:12.55]So we're doing, uh, Act 3 coming up?
[114:15.70]I guess, dude?
[114:18.45]How long is each campaign?
[114:20.21]I don't know, probably four, five, six hours maybe.
[114:22.48]We're probably halfway through the game.
[114:29.73]Are you Chris?
[114:30.83]My sisters told me all about you.
[114:33.06]Chris.
[114:33.97]The man is a wanted insurgent.
[114:37.71]Yes, he's a mercenary, but right now he's under the protection of the US government.
[114:42.02]He's no threat to the PSAA.
[114:43.95]Stara's watching Jerma beat chat with a wooden spatula.
[114:53.54]I don't want to be next.
[114:57.82]Just scared.
[115:01.48]Dude, just get to 100% and play modded Minecraft already.
[115:14.48]That probably hurt.
[115:17.61]Did they not care about this thing's well-being?
[115:20.03]They like bumped it into the building.
[115:24.57]We'll talk later.
[115:29.18]Right now, you need to find cover.
[115:38.22]I'm not even phased.
[115:49.27]Nope, not gonna phase me.
[115:52.05]I only fell because the idiot behind me sucks and he fell.
[115:59.65]Oh my God.
[116:02.74]I love that I just randomly get these while I'm playing out of nowhere.
[116:07.60]It's like, oh, apparently he's getting stepped on.
[116:09.36]Alright, I deserve that.
[116:12.73]This has been an elbow scream.
[116:17.91]I'm sorry everybody.
[116:19.60]Uh, Derek, you gonna destroy the turrets?
[116:24.61]Alright, watch out.
[116:25.16]Is he going to crush our friends?
[116:26.53]Ooh.
[116:34.57]This guy sucks.
[116:41.22]Alright, we're going.
[116:43.68]Um...
[116:52.59]I think I got one.
[116:58.43]Okay.
[117:08.54]Are you supposed to get on that gun and shoot it?
[117:12.03]I don't know.
[117:12.50]I mean, I don't know.
[117:13.06]I ran around.
[117:13.76]I'm running around doing weird stuff.
[117:21.31]I got no ammo and no guns now.
[117:22.82]No, we'd have to just destroy the gun turrets.
[117:26.38]I think you have to... Can you shoot this?
[117:27.51]Can you blow it up?
[117:34.47]How do we destroy it?
[117:35.24]That guy is going crazy.
[117:40.30]How do I destroy it?
[117:43.72]Destroy all gun turrets.
[117:45.29]How?
[117:47.54]Why is that more relevant?
[117:51.65]I don't know.
[117:52.50]I don't know what to do.
[117:54.83]Oh, he has to do it.
[117:58.27]I need you to distract that giant V.O.W.
[118:02.05]I can't work with that V.O.W.
[118:03.32]around!
[118:07.57]Yes you can!
[118:08.43]Oh my god, dude.
[118:10.93]I'm gonna get crushed, you have to help me.
[118:14.52]How?
[118:16.30]How could I?
[118:16.96]It's right here.
[118:19.73]Thank you.
[118:23.16]I punched you with a jaw.
[118:25.72]Alright, let me heal.
[118:31.31]You just punched me and I'm on the ground again.
[118:34.04]You've done that to me like a hundred times so far.
[118:36.51]No, maybe three.
[118:44.71]I guess.
[118:45.72]Oh, there's people alive in here.
[118:58.24]Oh my God, bro.
[119:00.33]Good kick.
[119:03.03]Please don't... Oh my fucking God.
[119:16.04]We just need a little more time!
[119:18.81]Eat!
[119:20.70]Eat?
[119:21.52]What the hell was he doing?
[119:22.55]Does it hurt now?
[119:28.65]Alright, we have to distract this guy away.
[119:30.29]No, he's got it.
[119:30.94]He's got it.
[119:35.83]He's got it.
[119:36.33]Oh, shit.
[119:36.82]Oh, my God.
[119:38.54]How come I can't do that?
[119:40.16]He was doing that?
[119:46.44]We have to do this two more times.
[119:56.12]Alright, should we change the title to playing Resident Evil 6 until we've had enough?
[120:04.48]I mean, where are you at on that scale?
[120:07.86]I'm not really that close.
[120:09.59]Are you?
[120:15.12]This game's cute.
[120:16.61]Oh shit, he's had enough.
[120:20.53]Uh oh.
[120:22.70]He's had enough.
[120:24.71]I'm having a good time because that one
[120:34.50]Resident Evil 9 early review copy?
[120:39.64]I would love if I could play Resident Evil 9 early.
[120:45.40]Oh, Res D9?
[120:46.68]That'd be sick.
[120:51.39]Capcom, I promise that if I can have that, then I'll definitely do like the... Hey guys, we're checking out Resident Evil 9 Early Access here.
[121:00.31]I've got some crazy stuff to show you.
[121:01.88]This is the Leon campaign starting off here.
[121:04.74]You know what to do.
[121:08.48]I don't...
[121:11.74]There's the...
[121:21.78]Alright, there's one more here.
[121:26.12]This one's about to go.
[121:26.99]Just keep him distracted.
[121:33.15]They just clapped, you guys.
[121:34.96]You said, fuck Capcom for years, bro.
[121:36.91]It's too late.
[121:37.75]Yeah, exactly.
[121:39.44]So, and Capcom has been one of my favorite companies.
[121:43.28]Doesn't that go to show how much I've grown from saying that?
[121:48.40]How much I like their games now to retract it?
[121:52.00]That I'm not allowed to grow as a person?
[121:54.88]No.
[122:01.01]You guys ever seen Ratatouille?
[122:05.73]So that's like half of your favorite movies in this chat.
[122:08.46]You can shut up.
[122:16.44]That's like half of everybody's favorite movie, and that whole movie is about a guy that's like, I don't like this restaurant, your food sucks, and then he eats a fucking thing and he gets teleported to his childhood and he loves it.
[122:26.43]That guy said fuck Capcom in the first 20 minutes of that movie and he's your favorite character in the movie.
[122:33.16]You love that guy now.
[122:35.17]And he got to wrap back around.
[122:40.54]He's almost done.
[122:50.58]Oh, fuck.
[122:52.50]That is what happens when a Titan dies.
[122:54.63]This is not far away enough, dude.
[122:56.28]Are you serious?
[122:58.85]Good job, Alpha.
[122:59.50]One gun left.
[123:03.54]Alpha, prepare to engage!
[123:13.34]War.
[123:15.36]They spawned guys on me in that cutscene.
[123:21.63]Somebody said, can YouTube play like you're making a YouTube video and you want to avoid shitting on it so badly and you need to talk about how fun it is?
[123:30.81]Yeah.
[123:31.45]Are you game for that?
[123:34.89]Uh, I feel like that joke's gonna go on way too long.
[123:38.18]How about we have one minute?
[123:39.83]Once we get started, it's the next hour.
[123:43.73]Alright, we won't do it.
[123:45.02]Never mind.
[123:45.96]Sorry, Shatter.
[123:48.35]Oh my god, I crushed her.
[123:51.98]I didn't know you were coming up the ladder.
[123:59.97]This is the most epic Resident Evil in the series.
[124:02.48]Where else have you seen a zombie this big?
[124:04.78]Let's go.
[124:12.71]I'm doing work down here.
[124:18.64]He's gonna step on me.
[124:20.63]Don't let him step on you.
[124:21.61]We're almost done.
[124:26.44]Dude, we're at a PB right now.
[124:28.17]This game...
[124:30.27]is not even that bad, but it is a 10 out of 10 headache creator.
[124:35.58]Between the music and the screen shaking,
[124:39.18]We just hit a PB.
[124:40.17]I'm gonna need to tile it off.
[124:41.45]I know.
[124:41.88]I'm struggling too.
[124:42.48]We just hit a PB though.
[124:45.45]We're probably the first anyone's ever gotten.
[124:47.60]We just have both of our personal PB in playing for this.
[124:49.64]We got to go a little bit longer, dude.
[124:51.25]Come on.
[125:00.18]Is that guy playing?
[125:03.43]He's still just shaking.
[125:06.33]Just stop.
[125:13.74]Alright, last charge going on.
[125:16.90]Yeah, look at me.
[125:17.94]Look at me.
[125:18.38]Come here.
[125:20.55]Come here.
[125:20.97]We need another 10 minutes, man.
[125:22.17]We just hit PB.
[125:23.60]Take a breath.
[125:24.62]I know it's rough.
[125:25.20]Alright.
[125:25.93]Take a little breather, okay?
[125:26.89]That's fine.
[125:28.68]Get it out.
[125:29.44]Get it out.
[125:30.06]As long as we get more of a PB, I don't care.
[125:34.14]I could go for some PB and J right now.
[125:38.28]That actually sounds sick.
[125:40.99]That does sound pretty good.
[125:42.26]Yeah, any jelly enjoyers?
[125:45.11]What's like a real good jam on a PB&J?
[125:48.66]Are you a strawberry jam, grape jam, raspberry?
[125:51.43]What's your...
[125:51.85]I like strawberry, but all I really know are the like...
[125:55.10]The Smuckers, I guess.
[125:57.15]I feel like there's got to be some like real, authentic, local, something better.
[126:04.69]You gotta get the preserves.
[126:05.74]You gotta get the strawberry preserves.
[126:08.27]They're usually at pretty much every grocery store.
[126:16.16]Okay, the last one's up here.
[126:23.27]Gotta find where Amish people sell their jams.
[126:27.61]It's kind of like a farmer's market.
[126:28.75]Do you have any farmer's markets that you can go to?
[126:31.06]I'm not sure.
[126:32.85]Who's the big guy?
[126:35.46]I think he's marked with a red.
[126:37.51]No, that's not what that is.
[126:47.69]I feel like it's wrapped us around so many times to get over here.
[126:59.40]Amish make a mean fried chicken?
[127:02.33]Really?
[127:02.59]Sounds kind of good.
[127:10.45]They don't make anything mean.
[127:11.86]They're delightful.
[127:13.31]Turn the music off, please.
[127:15.63]I'm almost at that point.
[127:17.48]Are you at that point?
[127:18.28]It just keeps looping.
[127:19.99]Let's see what it's like without the music.
[127:21.30]It's the same like three chords.
[127:23.37]Let's turn it off.
[127:32.15]Dude, come on, man.
[127:35.26]You can't right now.
[127:36.03]It's going to keep spawning on us.
[127:38.78]There's always a guy spawning.
[127:49.30]This is weird now.
[127:56.54]Watch out!
[128:00.32]Where are we getting back to?
[128:05.18]By get back, do you mean run in a circle and don't move?
[128:13.19]Um, what?
[128:15.34]Are you alright?
[128:16.71]Oh god, where are you?
[128:18.70]I'm bleeding out.
[128:19.74]Uh, as long as you stay alive, you're fine.
[128:21.85]I mean, I can.
[128:23.11]I'm bleeding out.
[128:24.84]When that gets all the way up, you come back to life.
[128:29.27]Take a look at that thing's back.
[128:32.11]I think you got shot again.
[128:34.30]Yeah, I did.
[128:37.11]You sure did.
[128:37.77]Oh, man.
[128:43.33]Echo team can't land until you take care of that other VOW.
[128:49.58]We'll try to...
[128:52.83]Da da da da da da da da da.
[128:56.26]Why did we not get a duck noise?
[128:57.74]You really are not happy.
[129:00.27]A little late.
[129:06.25]Hold it out.
[129:12.33]Can we just reach up?
[129:15.92]Exploit the BOW's weakness.
[129:17.68]I'm gonna shoot it with the machine gun.
[129:25.45]Oh, this game has exploits.
[129:30.78]Do you have access to one of those mini guns?
[129:33.47]You can get on him, but I don't know how to get back up there now.
[129:36.23]Oh shit, a B.O.W.
[129:37.40]Gotta buy rope.
[129:37.94]Got me.
[129:39.87]I can't... My head... My head...
[129:48.50]I fucking slept out front of gamestop to get this copy
[129:54.02]Yeah, imagine being the guy that brought the sleeping bag to this midnight release.
[129:57.30]Oh, you probably feel real bad.
[130:03.22]It's physically hurting me.
[130:06.30]Do you want to actually stop playing again if you want?
[130:08.19]No, no, no.
[130:09.07]I have to turn down the music though.
[130:14.96]How do we exploit the weakness?
[130:22.12]It's not stopping.
[130:25.32]I hope I don't get stomped.
[130:31.04]I think one of us has to get on one of the machine guns.
[130:35.65]Yeah I just don't know how to get back up there.
[130:41.49]This is a torture game.
[130:42.65]Alright, he's coming to me.
[131:00.39]Wait, uh, our buddy's going up there.
[131:11.17]Wait, wait, wait, he's going down, he's going down.
[131:17.72]He didn't like that.
[131:22.23]Where's he going?
[131:30.28]He didn't throw that at anybody.
[131:33.14]I have no bullets.
[131:40.20]How the hell did I get up there before?
[131:42.53]Okay, now that you mentioned it, my face does feel like it's hurting.
[131:48.82]you know 100 I have a headache and it will only I only realize how bad it is once we stop you're done
[131:57.44]It would've been so much worse if we still had the field of view from before.
[132:00.78]Oh my god, now that you've put it into my brain, it's all I can see.
[132:06.78]All you can see is the shaking Well it's worse for me because I have a fucking sniper rifle That's true
[132:16.26]your hands default shake while you're zoomed in and he's stomping around and you're trying to like pinpoint the dot
[132:24.22]What are we actually supposed to do?
[132:25.47]Why did we destroy the turrets before killing the big monsters?
[132:31.50]Chris!
[132:32.00]Chris, I don't get it!
[132:34.33]Well, I mean, they could have been used to exploit Wesker, could have been behind it.
[132:40.73]Wesker could have probably showed up and used it.
[132:47.25]What is it that all the football players get?
[132:52.39]Alright, uh, are we- is this the PB right here?
[132:56.79]No, we have to beat this segment.
[132:59.24]We have to.
[132:59.84]I don't know how.
[133:00.46]This has to be right at the end.
[133:01.67]Find and exploit the VOWs.
[133:03.79]We know it.
[133:04.20]We found it.
[133:04.74]It's in his back, but we're too small to get up on him.
[133:06.78]Alright, what if I dodge?
[133:11.96]It just shows me that.
[133:15.38]It just shows me you getting pounded.
[133:20.35]Alright, last try, last try, last try, last try.
[133:23.97]You have to get it to drop to its knees.
[133:26.65]Let it walk over here and it drops down because it gets stuck in this wire.
[133:52.95]Pull it out.
[133:54.49]I think one of us has to be up here.
[133:59.96]Yeah, but I don't... How did I get up on that building?
[134:02.76]I don't know, but the ladder needs to be kicked down.
[134:04.77]Hold on.
[134:11.60]That ladder has to get kicked down so somebody can be up there.
[134:18.74]How do we get up there in the first place?
[134:26.45]this underground route.
[134:30.13]Did we softlock the game?
[134:32.90]No, don't say that.
[134:40.93]God, why did I come to work today?
[134:43.82]He got stuck in a hole.
[134:48.39]That his weakness?
[134:50.19]That's weird.
[134:52.71]There's other places on the map where you can do the same thing.
[134:54.98]Dude, that's like really far away.
[135:03.09]Sorry dude, no one's ever been this far.
[135:07.26]No, what the fuck was the point of this?
[135:10.87]I mean, I'd love to get more ammo down here.
[135:19.59]You guys are on world first pace right now.
[135:24.75]Last guy to try to do this puked.
[135:27.93]we got here he's going to be sick oh it did get me up here it did
[135:35.89]Oh, you're up there?
[135:36.92]Alright.
[135:37.40]Yeah.
[135:38.95]I'm gonna exploit the weakness.
[135:40.46]Go exploit it.
[135:54.81]Oh my god.
[135:59.60]Imagine it's 2012 when your friend convinces you to buy this instead of Black Ops Zombies.
[136:07.21]Alright, you ready to exploit?
[136:10.97]Why did I fall down?
[136:12.59]Alright, exploit him, exploit, exploit, exploit!
[136:17.93]What is this lady doing?
[136:18.94]Oh, kick that ladder down over here.
[136:19.96]Kick this ladder down.
[136:21.44]By me.
[136:27.04]Nice.
[136:27.82]Alright, let's exploit it.
[136:32.38]There it is!
[136:33.61]Exploit!
[136:47.58]Is he dead?
[136:50.05]You've exploited it.
[136:51.72]This guy is just...
[136:53.16]There's just some guy in our lobby just griefing us.
[136:57.70]Is this guy just shooting?
[136:58.56]He's like friendly fire killing us.
[137:04.11]There's just like constantly one annoying guy this whole time.
[137:11.42]Your name's red like you're my enemy.
[137:16.48]I already gave the pilot the coordinates.
[137:18.60]Thank you so much for your help.
[137:21.88]Hey.
[137:24.55]We met.
[137:24.95]Well, you jarheads all look the same to me, pal.
[137:29.55]Sorry.
[137:30.64]That upset him that much?
[137:37.40]He said we look alike.
[137:45.17]Your character has a likability problem.
[137:46.96]I feel like Chris is about to think again.
[137:52.54]Once per cutscene.
[137:58.96]Do you know what BSAA stands for?
[138:02.14]The Bullshit Asshole Associates.
[138:07.93]I didn't know that.
[138:08.69]Is that in the lore?
[138:14.23]That's the worst joke I've made all day.
[138:16.87]Yep.
[138:17.47]And my chat loved it.
[138:19.88]That pisses me off.
[138:24.07]Anyone saying +2 should get a one minute timeout.
[138:31.35]Okay, spread out.
[138:39.56]Dude, is this the- Oh!
[138:41.89]Ster!
[138:42.53]This is the mansion from Resident Evil 1.
[138:47.52]It's like they're in cocoons.
[138:49.59]But we're not in, like, Raccoon City, right?
[138:52.02]Dot op.
[138:54.87]I mean, it did kind of...
[138:58.93]You didn't hear the cutscene?
[139:00.74]We're gonna go back to a place that I know.
[139:05.75]A reading?
[139:09.36]Oh, everyone get back here.
[139:11.23]It's story time.
[139:20.87]Dude, yuck.
[139:22.84]Disgusting.
[139:24.89]Finally, we got some horror stuff.
[139:28.78]Oh, is that my brain on the table with a cleaver in it?
[139:31.84]There's a gun.
[139:32.44]Wait, there's somebody over there, man.
[139:34.07]Somebody just showed it.
[139:34.69]It didn't look like a zombie to me.
[139:38.84]Who was that?
[139:47.97]That guy got destroyed.
[139:52.42]I got an assault shotgun, dude.
[139:56.66]It's over for this game.
[139:59.73]It's like my favorite weapon.
[140:02.58]I feel like this game is the result of Resident Evil 4 was good.
[140:05.83]And then like all of the writers left.
[140:10.61]I don't know.
[140:11.73]And then, like, new guys came in.
[140:14.02]I got a shotgun.
[140:17.94]I don't think anybody knows why this game is as bad as it is.
[140:21.31]Did you get the new weapon?
[140:22.40]I did
[140:27.52]Hey, you know what?
[140:28.07]I feel like the zombies are doing the same thing where they kind of talk in the way they do in Resident Evil 4.
[140:33.03]Do you want some real talk, though?
[140:35.19]Here's the actual real talk.
[140:36.84]This game sucks, but you know what?
[140:40.45]Almost every other Resident Evil has been great.
[140:43.99]But they're allowed to make a stinker ever.
[140:45.76]You know what I'm saying?
[140:46.38]Like, that's fine.
[140:48.01]If every single one since six have been terrible, but they just kept pumping them out, you know.
[140:56.75]If they just kept making a shitty game that was just never really improved...
[141:01.95]Then I would, I agree with you.
[141:05.49]But 7 was good.
[141:06.49]8 was great.
[141:07.88]I think 9 is going to be pretty good.
[141:08.98]The remakes have been incredible.
[141:11.55]I think that Comcast...
[141:14.21]I almost said Comcast.
[141:16.84]I think Capcom gets a pass here.
[141:24.83]They've made bangers ever since.
[141:27.58]And listen to this.
[141:29.84]Think about the fact that they were like, dude, this game was bad.
[141:32.49]We gotta fucking make it better next time, man.
[141:35.24]We gotta go back to the drawing board.
[141:36.99]And they did.
[141:37.49]And it was great.
[141:39.67]I think that gives them... You know what?
[141:41.37]You made not a great game, but then you came back and made a great one.
[141:44.51]And then made another good one.
[141:45.66]And then made a couple of great remakes.
[141:48.68]That's fine, man.
[141:50.18]Give them some slack.
[141:51.24]They deserve it.
[141:52.81]They could have made Resident Evil 6 seven more times.
[141:55.46]And they'd make it $80.
[141:57.86]Do you know what I'm saying?
[141:58.67]Capcom did have a real glow up in the same era on all their games.
[142:08.83]Oh, what is that?
[142:09.85]I'm in trouble man.
[142:15.69]He's gonna get me.
[142:20.47]There are people who love Resident Evil 6.
[142:23.87]It's not that bad.
[142:25.12]It's just not great.
[142:30.19]It's not great.
[142:36.96]What am I looking at here?
[142:41.58]The Revelation game.
[142:42.35]Actually, I don't think I've played the Revelation games.
[142:45.97]Maybe one of them.
[142:51.60]I think Resident Evil movie is better than this though.
[142:57.51]Now that I disagree with.
[143:01.09]Okay.
[143:09.29]I can't even see what's happening in this room.
[143:11.22]Why is he a monkey?
[143:12.06]Oh my god.
[143:17.08]So the shotgun's for...
[143:18.52]Hello.
[143:25.54]Oh my god.
[143:26.50]It's like fighting the game we're just playing where wins meet.
[143:33.81]Dead.
[143:35.83]There's another one.
[143:39.73]Are there two?
[143:40.25]Yeah, they don't take damage while they're coming out.
[143:45.08]If you think that's when you should do it.
[143:53.07]You gotta shoot him in the goo.
[143:57.47]Oh my god, there's another one!
[144:00.44]I'm out of bullets!
[144:06.11]Can they be broken with any other weapon?
[144:10.10]Yeah.
[144:20.30]I have voice cues.
[144:25.82]That'd be fun.
[144:29.29]I would.
[144:31.59]I keep thinking they're saying POWs and it takes a really dark turn for this game.
[144:38.58]It's bio weapons.
[144:41.48]Yeah, I'm thinking prisoner of war.
[144:44.11]That's not what this is.
[144:46.80]We finally killed them all.
[144:56.85]Bio of Weapon.
[145:03.80]+2.
[145:07.53]You're really good with acronyms.
[145:10.72]Thanks, dude.
[145:19.85]This is not a real door.
[145:26.51]We haven't put- we haven't put one gem in anything.
[145:30.31]Though they got rid of that after four.
[145:32.58]I don't even know why they did.
[145:33.69]It's kind of in five a little bit, but...
[145:36.72]They brought it back for eight.
[145:39.24]It was in 7-2, wasn't it?
[145:42.06]Yeah.
[145:43.42]That was some of my favorite parts of 4.
[145:45.27]And then they kind of said, ah, maybe we shouldn't do that, and there's no such thing as upgrading weapons anymore.
[145:49.79]Until they got back to 7.
[145:51.98]Actually, no, you upgrade in five.
[145:54.53]I think this game just sucks.
[146:01.06]See you, Iris.
[146:02.54]I thought there was a pregnancy test.
[146:05.18]Sergeant.
[146:07.19]Nice to see the cavalry's here.
[146:08.79]Who are you?
[146:11.00]I work here.
[146:12.36]My name's Ada Wong.
[146:13.73]They held me hostage.
[146:15.80]C-Virus.
[146:17.59]That must be what's creating those J'wav'o.
[146:20.11]Yeah, I heard them saying something about that.
[146:23.42]What else did you hear?
[146:24.51]That's Ada?
[146:26.51]Yeah.
[146:27.23]That's what she said.
[146:36.45]new umbrella new umbrella the organization or at least I think that's what they were calling
[146:46.81]So the C virus came from them.
[146:49.82]That's all I know.
[146:51.50]Look, Pierre.
[146:52.78]You're not supposed to talk in this cutscene.
[146:56.16]I'm the main character.
[146:57.55]Let me do the talking.
[146:59.52]Yes, sir.
[147:00.19]You die in like fucking three episodes.
[147:02.59]Sorry, sir.
[147:04.70]Don't let it happen again, soldier.
[147:11.98]She's a double agent!
[147:14.15]Get her!
[147:15.07]She's a double agent.
[147:25.00]Get her!
[147:35.66]Wait, we can't hurt A- Why can we only hurt Ada?
[147:41.07]What the fuck?
[147:48.67]Oh, the evil.
[147:51.94]These look like Power Ranger villains.
[147:54.99]Make my minion grow!
[147:56.78]We have to fight it with the Gundam.
[148:00.99]True.
[148:04.36]Ugh!
[148:05.49]Ugh!
[148:13.24]What are you doing?
[148:13.98]There's a way out on the second floor!
[148:19.13]You don't want the items?
[148:20.83]You got me.
[148:22.25]You're getting us killed.
[148:24.07]You're getting you killed, everyone else is going up the fucking stairs!
[148:27.01]You are throwing flash- you're talking about the screen shake game, you are bloat- you're blinding me!
[148:31.89]It's blinding them too.
[148:33.47]Get up the stairs.
[148:34.78]But what about the trinkets?
[148:36.81]I'm covering you.
[148:37.95]No, but what about the goodies and the trinkets?
[148:43.90]open the door dickhead let's get out of this game
[148:52.90]Let's get out of this game.
[148:54.42]Sgt.
[148:58.26]We're stuck in Resident Evil 6.
[149:01.11]We have to go!
[149:04.44]No, no, he's coming.
[149:06.01]What is that?
[149:08.19]It's a giant lizard.
[149:16.61]What the hell is it doing?
[149:17.75]It's a spinner!
[149:22.03]Oh my goodness, I wish I could shoot...
[149:27.36]Shot it in the face by accident.
[149:29.37]She went rolling.
[149:35.91]Will you help me with these deados over here?
[149:37.65]I'm helping you.
[149:39.62]They're blasting me with...
[149:44.94]And this is why we do this.
[149:46.75]Because we've got so many trinkets.
[149:49.26]You didn't want to get any trinkets down there.
[149:51.79]I haven't upgraded a skill yet.
[149:57.68]DANGEROUS TO ADVANCE WITH THESE HOSTILES AROUND!
[150:02.80]All hostiles eliminated.
[150:04.06]Let's move!
[150:05.73]Isn't that from the RFP-D pizza department?
[150:14.79]Dettos, right?
[150:15.61]Dettos, yeah.
[150:17.80]Preston Pizza Department.
[150:23.36]That was a good video.
[150:29.14]Wait, let me heal.
[150:32.87]Something bad is going to happen once we jump down.
[150:34.65]Oh, checkpoint.
[150:42.74]This is the worst game you've played on stream, and I'm including the Santa Roller Coaster game.
[150:46.58]You're just out of your mind.
[150:48.04]This is definitely not in the same category.
[150:51.82]Oh, do you want to know what I think is the worst you've played?
[150:55.29]It's not the worst, but I was kind of infuriating with that rhythm game you were playing where the two people with the legs tied together.
[151:04.17]Oh, that was so much fun.
[151:05.51]That's one of the most fun games I've played.
[151:07.14]I had that on my second monitor.
[151:08.87]And after a while, it was just like...
[151:11.58]I was like he's not even saying anything.
[151:13.79]It's just the same noise for like an hour.
[151:15.73]I can't be here anymore.
[151:17.26]Isaac, leave.
[151:19.80]You're not strong enough.
[151:21.05]That's fine.
[151:21.45]I wasn't.
[151:26.68]And guess what?
[151:27.74]I got to 661 steps.
[151:29.69]Listen, I liked it, but not an hour of it.
[151:34.66]That's fine.
[151:36.84]Was it you playing the game?
[151:38.30]No.
[151:40.07]So then what are we even talking about?
[151:42.16]Nothing.
[151:42.66]I'm just telling you how I feel.
[151:45.83]And every time you reject my emotions.
[151:52.11]Wait, Northernlion mogged you.
[151:53.90]What do you mean?
[151:54.44]What did he get?
[151:55.86]What did he get on the step game?
[151:58.44]He got 966?
[152:09.10]So I got 661, so that means I am...
[152:14.99]like 70% of the way to the Northernlion level, which that's fine with me.
[152:34.23]Where are you?
[152:34.77]I don't know.
[152:36.67]I'm crawling under tunnels.
[152:50.08]Where are you?
[152:54.13]Where's Ada?
[152:55.84]She was following me.
[153:03.22]She was way behind.
[153:04.51]Clear.
[153:18.53]Finn's dead right now.
[153:23.45]3... 2...
[153:31.01]One.
[153:41.76]All these monsters and the biggest one was a woman.
[153:49.95]To be fair, me and Pierre shot her in the head.
[154:15.14]Hang in there.
[154:16.95]Hang in there, Finn.
[154:18.60]Don't give in.
[154:19.22]You're gonna be alright.
[154:21.61]What are you gonna do?
[154:22.25]What are you gonna pull him through?
[154:25.03]It's like you're covered in butter, Finn.
[154:26.64]We can pull you through the bars.
[154:28.37]I am the antidote, Finn!
[154:35.38]Captain, we gotta move!
[154:44.15]Uh-oh.
[154:48.08]They're gonna make us kill our friend.
[154:50.93]No one is going?
[154:53.50]And nobody fired a round.
[155:17.63]Finn, I know you can hear me in there.
[155:25.29]Did those sleepless nights mean nothing, Finn?
[155:28.68]I know you're there.
[155:29.54]Ooh.
[155:35.57]Okay.
[155:38.80]This is the haunted house exit door just flashed over there.
[155:42.63]How are you doing?
[155:47.40]How do you want me to be doing?
[155:49.39]I cannot make decisions for you.
[155:52.82]Was that stage an hour?
[155:54.99]I mean, we died.
[155:55.94]We were on the, we were chasing around the screen shake enemy for these 30 or 40 minutes.
[156:03.13]I can keep going Okay
[156:12.59]You can actually unlock an ability.
[156:20.79]Yeah, you know what I am.
[156:21.88]Dude, how about defense?
[156:32.22]You know, scrolling through these, usually stuff like this excites me.
[156:38.43]I don't care.
[156:39.43]None of these are interesting.
[156:40.58]I don't care about anything in here.
[156:43.98]I guess it's
[156:46.56]They simplified this.
[156:47.91]Okay.
[156:48.59]This reminds me of when in World of Warcraft...
[156:52.45]They went from the talent tree to the pick one of these three things, dickhead.
[156:58.96]Like, why did they get rid of the upgrade system in 4.5?
[157:01.96]It just feels like everybody loved that.
[157:04.32]It was like everybody enjoyed that.
[157:07.44]I really couldn't tell you.
[157:09.24]Why did they get rid of that?
[157:14.37]Alright, I'm definitely gonna do it's an ammo maybe recovery.
[157:18.95]This I'm sorry, but this skill point system is also how I feel about Borderlands.
[157:25.29]I haven't liked Borderlands, I think, ever.
[157:29.07]I actually don't understand how people liked Borderlands.
[157:31.13]Is that going to get me in trouble?
[157:32.82]Yeah.
[157:33.41]Probably.
[157:34.03]But no, if someone says, what do you mean?
[157:36.20]Then you just like, what was Randy Pitchford?
[157:39.08]You just say Randy Pitchford and it like absolves, you know?
[157:43.40]I just didn't like it.
[157:44.84]The first two games were fine, but it got to a point where I would press Q to do ultimate and everything just dies.
[157:51.18]It just felt like it was the game, the Ultimates made the game just so easy for me.
[157:55.65]I don't like Ultimates in games like that.
[157:57.16]I don't think first-person shooters should have Ultimates.
[157:59.91]There you go.
[158:00.35]That's my real take.
[158:01.57]I agree.
[158:02.24]I've had that take as someone who plays first person shooters with ultimates.
[158:07.09]Yeah.
[158:13.92]What'd you pick?
[158:16.71]Sniper, like rifle ammo pickup.
[158:21.30]The uber charge is an ultimate.
[158:24.63]Uh...
[158:27.81]Yeah, and it's the worst part of that game.
[158:30.38]Hold on a second, though.
[158:31.64]Hold on a second, though.
[158:34.07]It's probably... Let's let go of this.
[158:36.84]It's harder to get an uber charge in TF2 than an ultimate in pretty much every single other first-person shooter.
[158:42.10]Is that accurate?
[158:44.05]To keep and hold it.
[158:45.82]Yes.
[158:47.72]Especially because you can see when they have it and you can stop it.
[158:51.37]You don't just have like a thing that just... And in a lot of these other FPS games, doesn't it stay...
[158:56.71]It persists your percentage through death, doesn't it?
[158:59.32]In some of them?
[159:01.00]Most of them.
[159:02.24]Yeah.
[159:02.70]Right.
[159:03.12]So there you go.
[159:04.11]All of them.
[159:06.61]So if you get a 40% ultimate charge, it's 40% even after you die.
[159:12.27]Uber charge is different.
[159:14.08]Yes, sir.
[159:14.60]Get wrecked, whoever said that.
[159:19.90]Yeah, I also, I take it back.
[159:21.37]It's not the worst thing in that.
[159:23.69]Oh, you said that.
[159:26.40]Yeah.
[159:28.44]I don't know why I said that.
[159:32.58]Upon reflection, Sturgis says things.
[159:36.39]Oh, VRJosh said it too?
[159:45.23]I actually like the Uber in TF2.
[159:51.17]Captain, we've got contact!
[159:53.99]I think the Sentry Gun and the Uber is some of the greatest video game design in history.
[160:03.17]The TF2 sentry gun, I think, is one of the most unbelievably designed things in modern video game human history.
[160:13.70]Mini-Sentry, that's a different story.
[160:15.99]But the regular sentry gun... is a 10 out of 10 in video game design.
[160:25.67]Not bad.
[160:26.12]Pretty good.
[160:27.24]Yep.
[160:31.71]But then what about the spy?
[160:33.13]They have that in Overwatch?
[160:35.34]Oh, please.
[160:37.18]No, they one-to-one copied it in, like, early Overwatch.
[160:41.38]yeah but it wasn't it wasn't even that have it but it was not even close dude it's not even close
[160:49.60]I concur on many levels.
[160:59.50]If you took the Ultimates out of Overwatch, do you think it would be a better game?
[161:03.80]I was just saying yeah no I I I think part two of that if you take tanks out of the game FPS games should not have tanks and they shouldn't have ultimates
[161:16.73]It's broken from its very foundation.
[161:18.31]That was a useless cutscene.
[161:24.89]It kind of was.
[161:29.83]If you're gonna have tanks, they should not have more mobility than everyone else.
[161:36.02]You know when you do- okay.
[161:37.86]Speaking of the top 250.
[161:38.93]That's coming along.
[161:41.66]Uh, it's gonna be really cool.
[161:43.04]I have no ammo in anything.
[161:45.23]Uh, you know what's weird, and we'll talk about this during the top 250 stream, coming soon.
[161:53.70]Yeah?
[161:56.32]I'm gonna glaze TF2 a lot right now because you know when you're playing a game you just don't even realize that it is like the pinnacle of everything that will ever come after that.
[162:07.63]Yeah.
[162:08.71]You don't even know it's happening.
[162:09.90]You're just like, man, this is amazing.
[162:11.55]This is great.
[162:12.21]I love what I'm doing right now.
[162:13.82]And you don't realize that that's the pinnacle of like you are playing something and you think like, oh, the future of gaming is so bright.
[162:20.52]If this is what we have now and then everyone that comes out, you're like, wait a second.
[162:23.81]Yeah, like everything that came out in that same kind of genre was just not even remotely close.
[162:30.20]Like you were playing...
[162:32.01]What was the absolute peak of that genre?
[162:42.93]And you didn't even know it.
[162:44.13]We did this level already.
[162:45.76]We actually did.
[162:50.51]This is the asset flip level.
[162:57.83]Bloodborne aware.
[162:58.97]Yeah, it's true.
[163:03.40]You could say that that's true.
[163:20.15]Oh shit, thinking of no bullets.
[163:25.00]Bloodborne was not the peak?
[163:27.63]I think it was pretty close for that kind of video game style, for that kind of Souls game.
[163:33.67]I mean Elden Ring is...
[163:35.78]I mean it just came out later, had more tech, had more...
[163:40.24]but Bloodborne I think was almost pretty close to being perfect all the way through except for one or two little areas that I don't like.
[163:48.15]I mean, I think if Bloodborne were open world, it would have had the same cultural impact.
[163:52.51]I think people just love open world stuff.
[163:55.17]But Bloodborne's narrative and world building and stuff is to me a lot cooler than Elden Ring.
[164:04.84]I agree.
[164:16.42]Have you used a first aid spray one time?
[164:20.04]Yeah, I've used like three of them.
[164:21.89]Oh, I don't even know what this item is.
[164:25.95]The blood vials, the blood vials were kind of dumb.
[164:28.48]I will agree.
[164:29.58]yep that's one thing that I would delete the secure kind of did that too though the like you have to farm for heels stuff
[164:38.30]and they did the same thing where you um like bullets were consumable
[164:43.33]Yeah, if you get rid of the consumable...
[164:44.84]I mean, well, Demon's Souls did that too, but they gave you such an unbelievable metric fuckton of them that it didn't really matter.
[164:49.68]Yeah, but Demon's Souls is like 40 years old and you can forgive them for not knowing.
[164:53.25]That's true.
[164:54.92]But even still, they gave you so many that it never became a problem.
[164:59.11]When they made Demon's Souls, Miyazaki was what, like seven years old?
[165:05.23]Dude, he made that game when he was 15.
[165:07.12]Isn't that insane?
[165:08.47]Yeah.
[165:10.40]And put in World Tendency.
[165:16.05]That's an armored chopper they brought in.
[165:18.75]It rules out conventional arms.
[165:28.76]I love how you shot once over there with the shotgun.
[165:33.35]At least you could say you helped.
[165:35.80]Me?
[165:36.64]Was that not you?
[165:37.24]I had a sniper rifle.
[165:39.14]Was it?
[165:39.38]Who shot the shotgun?
[165:40.28]It had nothing.
[165:41.84]I think you thought that was a shotgun.
[165:44.04]It's a sniper rifle.
[165:45.35]Dude, this guy is a crab guy and he's driving the helicopter.
[165:49.64]What is this?
[165:50.10]Look at this.
[165:52.28]I don't know, man.
[165:59.50]Can I shoot him out of the cockpit?
[166:13.06]Can we not do this?
[166:17.51]We're protecting the people on the ground.
[166:18.98]I don't know if we can do anything about this helicopter.
[166:21.17]I think we can shoot the people on the helicopter.
[166:23.78]There's people like on it.
[166:28.12]Where's the thing want us to go?
[166:42.40]For a second, I thought we changed characters.
[166:48.24]I thought I was Pierre.
[166:54.01]Another one immediately just jumps on.
[166:56.22]This is the dumbest enemy in any Resident Evil game, by the way.
[167:00.23]They threw their hands in the air.
[167:03.14]Just going, what other animal can we combine them with?
[167:05.51]How about a toad?
[167:09.22]Kangaroo.
[167:13.21]These suckers can really jump, watch out!
[167:20.77]and then they have guns they have these weird ass legs and it's just the guy aiming a gun at you get out of here
[167:34.46]it really doesn't matter what evolution they keep getting because at the end of the day oh this one's a fish
[167:40.89]Pops out of the water with an SMG.
[167:43.78]Yeah, the actual biology of the animal doesn't matter because they have a gun.
[167:49.49]You're right.
[167:50.41]I have no idea what we're doing here.
[167:52.09]We have to get all the fucking barnacles off of the helicopter.
[167:56.92]I have no ammo for these barnacles.
[167:59.42]I got it.
[167:59.74]There's only one.
[168:00.29]Okay.
[168:01.27]They're all up.
[168:06.24]How is that?
[168:07.42]Excuse me?
[168:08.17]How did that happen?
[168:11.82]I don't know how to use the heal.
[168:19.58]Can we go down there?
[168:20.47]I can't find a way down.
[168:33.54]Come on turn This is how they keep getting on top
[168:51.53]Why do I feel like I'm playing Ark Raiders right now?
[168:53.98]That's what just popped in my brain.
[168:58.89]I've never played that game.
[169:01.52]You said you played it once, liar.
[169:03.25]Well, okay, I played it once and then never played it again.
[169:06.07]I did the tutorial thing.
[169:18.41]OK, we have to be close.
[169:25.36]I like just don't have ammo.
[169:27.83]I should get it when they turn.
[169:40.94]There's no music, it makes this really awkward.
[169:44.09]At least my head doesn't hurt.
[169:52.97]Can you get that last one?
[169:55.46]Are you out out?
[169:57.61]I have a few shotgun shells.
[170:05.93]This is the worst part of the game so far.
[170:17.98]Alright, we did it.
[170:19.84]That's another PB.
[170:23.23]That'd be too easy.
[170:24.81]Come on, keep moving.
[170:26.24]Captain, we should escort those two out of here.
[170:28.34]They'll never survive on their own.
[170:29.83]We're moving out.
[170:31.11]Let's go.
[170:37.69]Uh, we gotta go up, I think.
[170:40.72]Mm-hmm.
[170:46.51]Oh, yes.
[170:50.01]Super Mario.
[170:54.31]It's EDF!
[170:58.32]That is an EDF line, you're right
[171:05.40]Monsters!
[171:07.82]Monsters are attacking the city!
[171:19.17]We have reports of a humanoid monster.
[171:23.68]What is that thing?
[171:35.05]I did not want you to do that.
[171:37.08]That was, like, rude.
[171:38.26]Even if it healed me.
[171:39.49]Sprayed you.
[171:46.64]Wait, what?
[171:47.50]The guys missed!
[171:48.77]The guys behind you missed!
[171:50.72]Both of the guys jumped and they did not land over here.
[171:55.96]That's not good.
[171:56.92]I hear them in pain.
[172:04.37]That would hurt!
[172:07.77]Ooh, grenade launcher.
[172:09.69]Now we're talking.
[172:10.74]Now we're talking, dude.
[172:15.54]First aid spray.
[172:17.93]HQ, come in.
[172:18.99]This is Alpha.
[172:20.14]The chopper is targeting us now.
[172:22.23]Everyone, get the chopper down and bring it down hard.
[172:31.36]I missed.
[172:36.28]He's got giant chicken legs.
[172:38.35]And a sword.
[172:38.81]And a machete.
[172:46.66]Did I shoot through the window that was open?
[172:50.39]No, right?
[172:55.79]What?
[172:56.84]I think I shot that grenade through the open window.
[173:00.06]I don't think it exploded.
[173:09.14]I'm down did you shoot me?
[173:13.01]no I did not
[173:17.14]Okay, well, I'm dead if you don't get me up.
[173:20.01]You're dead.
[173:25.58]You shot me.
[173:27.06]I... You could go... Go look at the evidence.
[173:30.35]I did not.
[173:35.17]Yeah, you shot me.
[173:36.87]Go look at the evidence, I didn't.
[173:38.97]I have no idea what blew up then.
[173:44.92]Chopper's targeting us now!
[173:47.17]Everyone, bring that chopper down and bring it down hard!
[173:57.08]Fuck that guy.
[174:03.73]How would you shoot a grenade launcher like this from the ground?
[174:10.69]Oh, what?
[174:11.25]These don't have an arc.
[174:12.75]God damn it.
[174:13.62]Wait, what?
[174:15.02]They shoot straight.
[174:17.09]Yeah.
[174:17.77]Yes, it's not good.
[174:25.69]Where is it?
[174:27.96]It's hiding.
[174:34.93]What is he doing?
[174:35.98]And there's like 10 people hanging off of it.
[174:38.81]What is he?
[174:39.36]What is going on?
[174:40.36]This is the weirdest shit ever.
[174:41.75]He's flying so weirdly.
[174:58.00]0.0
[175:16.01]Who is that guy?
[175:16.83]I think it's him but bald.
[175:22.96]I said, our mission is to terminate the BOWs.
[175:34.18]I'm going after that B.O.W.
[175:37.03]Ada's not getting away with this.
[175:38.94]Captain, please, you need to think things through.
[175:42.60]I just want to let you know that this whole time I've been a double agent.
[175:46.30]And I will let you right into my trap.
[175:52.63]Hey!
[175:54.20]Hey!
[175:55.08]You promised!

[175:57.94]You promised!
[176:01.15]No, don't get me up, no!
[176:05.36]Now you must do my bidding.
[176:10.03]you killed yourself yeah but that's a that's a failure a failure reflecting on you
[176:19.49]I am the commander, that's true.
[176:21.72]I'm going after that B.O.W.
[176:24.47]Ada's not getting away with this.
[176:26.52]Captain, please.
[176:27.64]We need to think things through.
[176:31.73]Fuck, I had to reload mine.
[176:32.94]I want full health.
[176:39.57]That was such a fucked up thing Someone in real life is like, I just want full health
[176:48.38]What did he mean?
[176:49.47]What did he mean by that?
[176:52.77]You respawn, man.
[176:55.57]You know what?
[176:56.52]No, no, no.
[176:57.84]I want full health.
[176:59.89]What, are you done?
[177:00.54]Is that it?
[177:01.04]No, no, no.
[177:02.63]Let's go.
[177:03.13]Okay.
[177:10.76]I need ammo bad.
[177:21.95]These guys are running into walls.
[177:28.87]What have you got up?
[177:29.51]I don't know.
[177:37.86]That guy did not care.
[177:39.89]Yeah, we did this level.
[177:51.48]If you could make real life save states, what would you use them for?
[177:53.57]I would go to my favorite restaurant, sit in the chair and load one.
[178:01.77]And I would go back to it all the time.
[178:04.83]And I would make sure I was really hungry.
[178:06.98]I wouldn't eat all day.
[178:08.68]And I would order... By the way, the save state would be at when the food comes out.
[178:12.74]but I would make sure that I take a few bites first because sometimes it's not great.
[178:17.19]What if you get a kind of an off day?
[178:19.02]If I take a bite out of that fucking buffalo chicken sub from that place that I like, and it's... Oh my god, this is amazing.
[178:25.56]There you go, save state right there.
[178:29.75]Just so I could always enjoy it whenever I wanted.
[178:33.73]Imagine if you overwrote that.
[178:35.47]Yeah, imagine you overwrote that and the restaurant didn't exist anymore.
[178:38.63]Wow, that would be miserable.
[178:42.29]What the hell were you thinking, pulling a kamikaze stunt like that?
[178:44.70]These are my men.
[178:50.81]You follow my lead or I'll find someone who will.
[178:53.75]Do you even hear yourself?
[178:58.05]Then you have to relive every part of your life since the restaurant?
[179:00.40]No, that's not true.
[179:01.91]If you have, like, 20 save state slots... Fall in love.
[179:05.02]Just make sure that number 19 is right before you go back to 1.
[179:10.58]Don't you know how this works?
[179:12.35]You heard the man.
[179:12.95]Let's move.
[179:14.72]You heard the man.
[179:16.31]How are we supposed to drop this thing if we can't even see it?
[179:19.66]Shut up and keep moving!
[179:25.40]That was kind of aggressive.
[179:27.52]Keaton!
[179:28.68]Not you too!
[179:34.45]What's the plan, officer?
[179:35.95]Shut up!
[179:39.82]Hold on.
[179:41.16]I want you to go down and look at what you just did.
[179:42.83]Go down here and look towards the staircase.
[179:47.42]This was you.
[179:54.95]I did it better.
[179:56.62]That's the first time I knew that space was sprint, by the way.
[179:59.91]I was gonna say to you earlier...
[180:02.55]But, uh...
[180:14.48]here sorry I'm not going to kick this door until you do it too
[180:25.39]Rats!
[180:28.28]Why did I get a cutscene for that?
[180:30.17]That guy's gone.
[180:34.02]Shoot it!
[180:38.17]You could have saved him.
[180:44.20]I didn't want to.
[180:47.03]Jeez.
[180:51.53]Is there even a map in this game?
[180:56.20]There is only a hallway.
[180:59.68]Get away you sneaky piece of shit!
[181:06.15]hey this game has no wrong turns and it has an indicator of where to go
[181:16.75]This shit's in the way.
[181:17.93]Yeah, you really can't go wrong, can you?
[181:26.68]Didn't we just see everyone die?
[181:38.51]Captain!
[181:39.34]I can't find Jeff!
[181:40.71]He's gone!
[181:41.85]Get a hold of yourself, Marco.
[181:42.98]Where are you?
[181:44.69]Target is on the second floor y'all need to come here now
[181:57.26]Okay, can somebody get the image of the back of the box of Resident Evil 6?
[182:02.93]Because I'm curious if it says something along these lines.
[182:06.56]You and your squad are all that's up against the terrors of the Neo-Umbrella.
[182:11.76]Direct your squad to both fight and protect you
[182:18.05]Is it something like that on the back of the box?
[182:25.88]just says in big red text you will not like this warning sorry you were wrong that's what it says can you open this
[182:38.50]Yes.
[182:39.25]Why didn't you even bother to separate us?
[182:42.66]For the first time ever, command a squad in Resident Evil 6.
[182:49.54]That hallway look too dangerous?
[182:51.97]Send in this, uh...
[182:54.10]Explosions team.
[182:55.76]Send in the bass.
[183:04.31]You should be able to sit in that.
[183:22.85]Don't get cocky!
[183:25.29]Move it!
[183:28.38]Move it!
[183:28.70]This guy's in the way!
[183:35.17]The door was open.
[183:46.75]Where are you, you son of a bitch?
[183:49.73]One time I was a- I went to the wiki page of this game and someone edited to say the six on the cover art looked like a giraffe giving a blowjob.
[183:57.84]What?
[184:01.29]I don't know what that is.
[184:02.10]It does.
[184:12.04]Why'd you read that?
[184:13.11]Because I don't give a fuck.
[184:19.00]My instincts.
[184:25.44]Alright, get the snake.
[184:26.83]It's invisible.
[184:27.44]It's gonna eat this guy in about 10 seconds.
[184:38.74]Okay!
[184:48.80]You alright?
[184:53.09]Yeah.
[184:57.96]Behind you.
[185:01.17]Oh, don't get cocky.
[185:11.21]I thought I liquified this guy.
[185:15.11]Wait, I can hide in here.
[185:16.44]Okay, good luck.
[185:19.90]Can we both hide in here and just have our guy fight it?
[185:30.44]Oh shit!
[185:31.13]No, it's in here, it's in here.
[185:36.99]Stop!
[185:38.02]Stop!
[185:39.16]Cease fire!
[185:44.45]What took you so long?
[185:47.69]I do think we have to do this, it's not... Who am I talking to?
[185:58.74]I'm getting snaked up out here yeah should I come help you yeah come through I think this is like all cinematic
[186:09.44]Kids!
[186:16.56]Come through the tunnel, what are you doing?
[186:18.13]Come through the tunnel!
[186:18.98]It's so slow!
[186:19.52]Where's X?
[186:25.47]Okay, where is he?
[186:26.92]Point him out.
[186:28.67]He ate me.
[186:31.69]Oh yeah?
[186:32.11]Eat this.
[186:34.77]There's another tunnel.
[186:35.67]I really think we're supposed to not be fighting it and just like doing the checkpoint.
[186:42.26]I hear it.
[186:46.65]Oh, there he is.
[186:47.73]He's right there.
[186:53.17]Dude, that was a play and a half.
[186:56.99]That would go on a highlight reel.
[187:09.45]Where'd you go?
[187:10.92]I went through the hole.
[187:11.60]Like I said, we should both go through the hole.
[187:13.11]And you were blurbing.
[187:13.59]You said that was a gamer highlight reel.
[187:14.78]And then you didn't go through the hole.
[187:15.66]I just did a shitload of damage.
[187:17.21]And there's a bunch of items.
[187:18.38]I don't think you can damage it I don't believe it I have been damaging it for the last 30 to 45 straight days exactly though
[187:28.64]Take your gun out and aim and roll left.
[187:32.31]You know what I'm saying?
[187:35.99]But like... Oh, hold on.
[187:37.65]I see.
[187:38.03]I see.
[187:38.84]Yeah, yeah.
[187:46.49]Nice.
[187:47.28]Good, good, good strat.
[187:53.29]Oh, is this the dead end?
[187:54.52]This was just the funny?
[187:56.33]Oh my god!
[188:00.34]Loot get!
[188:01.81]Can we get a loot get in chat?
[188:03.31]Nice.
[188:13.44]Well... No!
[188:18.16]Why didn't you even give me a chance?
[188:25.71]Where are we now?
[188:27.72]Do we have to do all that again?
[188:30.53]Shit, I think we do.
[188:32.66]Would you get that treasure?
[188:33.51]It was just this room.
[188:35.67]It was this room's tunnel, so we're right here.
[188:46.94]Make sure you get the ammo
[188:57.33]Why are we so weird?
[189:02.02]There's a normal way to do this.
[189:08.22]Also, did you know that you had a stamina bar like Dark Souls on the bottom right?
[189:13.58]No.
[189:14.85]You do.
[189:18.88]Not everything is like Dark Souls.
[189:20.31]Yes, it is.
[189:22.91]It's an easy reference point to understand.
[189:28.82]Alright, I feel the snake's presence.
[189:50.32]You've never played a Dark Souls game?
[189:52.81]No.
[189:53.07]Really?
[189:53.61]Which one should I start with?
[189:55.92]Well, you should start with... Did you not come through the tunnel?
[190:00.34]Okay.
[190:04.84]Dude, just wait till I play King's Field.
[190:06.52]There's gonna be a nuts King's Field stream at some point.
[190:14.65]Taking you down!
[190:26.60]He has an explosive spit.
[190:27.72]Watch out.
[190:30.95]I'm watching.
[190:31.61]I'm watching out.
[190:35.10]Scary.
[190:38.75]Oh.
[190:46.45]Nothing more anticlimactic than not shooting because your gun's not loaded.
[191:05.83]If I were this thing, I'd give up by now.
[191:08.77]Yeah, you think you'd just leave.
[191:10.45]There's so many other people to eat that are terrible.
[191:14.16]And yeah, like that guy.
[191:15.93]Like, you could have just eaten that guy from the very beginning.
[191:22.34]What was that?
[191:23.38]After it?
[191:24.73]Why do I have a please wait?
[191:36.43]What?
[191:37.23]What are you saying right now?
[191:40.14]I'm going after it.
[191:41.13]What happened to you?
[191:42.33]My game says, please wait, and I'm at a loading screen.
[191:47.62]Okay, well, I need you for this door.
[191:49.41]Uh...
[191:55.01]I don't think I'm gonna get there.
[191:56.09]I see your name tag in a different spot.
[192:02.05]It says you left the game.
[192:05.62]Oh, man.
[192:09.57]Man.
[192:12.88]Look, it's you.
[192:13.68]Can you re-invite me?
[192:14.34]Can I?
[192:16.33]Maybe.
[192:16.63]Let me try.
[192:20.79]Good luck with that menu.
[192:22.25]Nope.
[192:24.00]What if I just do it through Steam itself?
[192:29.95]I cannot.
[192:33.18]I can not.
[192:36.61]Then you should just finish up the level so you have the same progress.
[192:41.16]I hope it's right after this door.
[192:44.54]Looks like you just have to like kill the snake after this.
[192:49.87]But my chat says, oh, God, this part doesn't inspire confidence.
[192:56.10]It doesn't.
[192:57.77]Defeat the BOW.
[192:59.55]We really were right here.
[193:04.06]Well, let's see who does it first.
[193:08.01]Okay, so what do we do?
[193:18.07]Okay.
[193:26.56]Poor fucking Marco.
[193:30.96]Oh, they make you play the actual snake video game?
[193:33.65]What is going on?
[193:35.56]Get out of this menu.
[193:42.97]I don't like this.
[193:50.16]Chibi-Robo you need to recharge oh marco
[194:05.60]I think I killed it.
[194:17.77]I don't know if Marco's okay, Chris.
[194:33.85]Wait.
[194:34.39]Oh, he's gonna help me up.
[194:42.21]Okay.
[194:47.12]Nice job, Marco.
[194:49.81]Well, at least we got it.
[194:52.89]But no waiter yet.
[194:55.94]Where you at?
[195:06.03]Uh, I just beat it.
[195:07.82]I think we both just did it.
[195:11.41]And now I have to...
[195:14.48]Kiss Marco.
[195:20.97]Oh, man.
[195:30.86]We liked that one.
[195:31.98]We liked that guy.
[195:44.09]We've got no choice.
[195:44.89]We have to kill him.
[195:46.74]He'd do the same for us.
[195:51.24]No, he would carry us around in a backpack and find a cure!
[195:54.38]What would you have done?
[195:56.10]You want to kill him?
[195:59.86]We would take one of his fuckin' arms!
[196:05.01]Oh, he's bugs now.
[196:10.41]Why is he doing this to us?
[196:12.60]Doesn't he know who we are?
[196:13.87]I think you're quite a bit ahead of me.
[196:16.80]Wait, I am?
[196:17.81]I thought you said you beat it.
[196:20.44]I did, but then I ran into the electricity three times.
[196:26.51]Oh, come on, dude.
[196:28.68]Where's my partner?
[196:31.02]You want to get me up?
[196:45.01]Okay, now this is the dumbest enemy I think of ever seen.
[197:02.17]uh okay so what what do I go from here
[197:12.34]Is it out the- I think it's out the window?
[197:13.69]I don't know.
[197:17.46]I thought he punched it.
[197:25.22]Yeah, it's pretty dumb.
[197:32.95]What do you what do I do?
[197:34.50]You have to shoot the bug flying around in the bees.
[197:41.72]What, I gotta teach you about the birds and the bees?
[197:43.91]Come on, man.
[197:44.71]It's a very healthy bug.
[197:53.03]I'm gonna die, man.
[197:54.07]You're better.
[197:54.61]I'm dead.
[198:00.60]I know ammo.
[198:04.47]Better you revived me.
[198:07.61]It's too many minus twos.
[198:09.64]It can't be real.
[198:12.82]I actually don't have ammo.
[198:19.64]Melee.
[198:22.19]Shut up.
[198:27.29]Do you even care about our mission anymore?
[198:30.90]I feel sorry for all the men that died believing in you.
[198:37.02]What happened to the legendary Chris Redfield, huh?
[198:39.63]What happened to you?
[198:40.54]It's a good thing Finn's not around to see you this way.
[198:47.86]He stood up to him I'm going after Ada
[198:56.80]How much more is there?
[199:04.83]Because I want to play with my friend.
[199:07.57]I don't know.
[199:08.55]There's a cutscene.
[199:16.07]I have not gotten a saved game indicator.
[199:20.80]Ada Wong has left the city and is heading south for the harbor.
[199:24.25]HQ to all teams, target Ada Wong has been spotted heading south for the harbor.
[199:28.47]We want her alive.
[199:35.38]Alright, I just got a save point.
[199:43.26]I don't understand why the, like...
[199:45.37]story is that Chris and this guy are arguing all the time because like that's that's you and your co-op partner.
[199:56.91]Yeah, you want to trust your call partner completely and thoroughly.
[200:02.18]Alright, I got a save point.
[200:06.24]Are you able to invite?
[200:07.07]I probably need to leave the game.
[200:09.05]Ah.
[200:25.63]Okay, let me try again.
[200:26.59]I'm still in the cutscene.
[200:40.36]New session.
[200:42.88]Let me know when you're out.
[200:43.72]You should probably leave the get out after.
[200:47.28]I can't control my settings.
[200:51.08]Why would you guys play this game during Christmas?
[200:53.43]Christmas was two days ago.
[200:56.86]We're done with Christmas.
[201:00.30]You should say for New Year's.
[201:04.41]Oh, where?
[201:17.08]Christmas lasts 12 days.
[201:18.39]I might have to close my whole game.
[201:24.15]We also could say sayonara.
[201:27.36]That's probably a good time for that.
[201:29.49]It's getting late.
[201:30.48]We could play another time.
[201:32.35]Alright, let's get a vote.
[201:34.91]Do you guys want to see us finish this campaign at some point in January?
[201:45.36]How much is even left by two or three chapters?
[201:50.25]I have no idea.
[201:53.45]I said, unfortunately, yes, we do.
[201:55.88]How different are the other campaigns?
[201:59.05]I honestly don't think they're that different.
[202:01.28]It's the same like three hallways.
[202:10.73]Can you guys just play something good?
[202:14.35]Well, I'm going to try and get the horsemen to play something.
[202:17.71]One of these days.
[202:19.08]This was a W stream.
[202:20.41]What are you talking about?
[202:21.97]It was a W stream.
[202:24.75]I laughed harder than I've laughed in probably like two or three months.
[202:31.56]Can we play something worse?
[202:33.95]actually don't know if we could I don't think I have anything in my library right now that could be worse
[202:47.19]I knew it was going to be janky, but I had a great time and we will finish this campaign.
[202:56.90]You laugh, but what about your viewers?
[202:58.93]You know how many Omega Lulls I saw over there?
[203:02.11]What are you, a Grinch?
[203:08.07]I'm just surprised how like the game didn't really change at all.
[203:19.00]You know what?
[203:19.40]They made four campaigns of the same campaign, I think.
[203:23.54]Instead of making just one good one.
[203:28.18]Or even two.
[203:31.14]but I had a lot of fun.
[203:34.56]Thanks, Ster, for playing.
[203:35.67]Yeah, we can play whenever.
[203:36.43]I'm always around.
[203:37.91]And I'm sure I'll see you again real soon.
[203:40.32]Everybody say goodbye, Ster.
[203:42.59]Are you still going?
[203:44.96]No, I'm not.
[203:45.52]Are you?
[203:46.49]No, no, no, no, no.
[203:48.08]Dinner time.
[203:48.74]It's time for food.
[203:50.83]Actually, I might actually go to the grocery store and figure out that jam situation.
[203:55.44]Jam sounds nice.
[203:56.76]Strawberry jam and peanut butter?
[203:58.67]Grape jam and peanut butter goes pretty crazy.
[204:02.01]I'll figure it out.
[204:04.84]Bye-bye.
[204:05.62]Thanks for having me.
[204:06.26]It was fun.
[204:06.83]Yeah.
[204:07.19]See you later, dude.
[204:10.42]Always good to hang out with Ster.
[204:13.02]And you probably noticed that Ster is a part of a lot of the sponsor streams now.
[204:19.52]Just much easier to like hang out with somebody and just be able to more naturally play and chill.
[204:25.32]So it's been wonderful.
[204:27.00]It's been great.
[204:29.95]It's made those way more fun to do.
[204:36.86]And I actually genuinely like that game.
[204:38.37]I think the game's fun.
[204:40.30]It is going to become my... Because after we did the first one, I was like, oh, okay, that was fine.
[204:44.50]They were like, hey, do you guys want to run it back?
[204:46.35]We're like, uh... Yeah.
[204:50.02]That's gonna be my iPad game for a while.
[204:59.34]But yeah, I will see you guys.
[205:01.59]There will be at least one more stream before the new year.
[205:07.05]So I might stream on New Year's Eve.
[205:09.30]I don't know if I'm going to stream late into New Year's Eve, but maybe a little bit earlier.
[205:12.26]Either the 30th or the 31st would be the next stream.
[205:17.53]Hey, and by the way, I'm almost at 100 streams this year.
[205:21.53]I heard that the other day that I think I think this is the 98th or 99th stream this year.
[205:27.31]I think that's more than I did in like 2021 or 2022.
[205:31.52]Which is crazy.
[205:33.35]But, you know, honestly, January, February this year was wild.
[205:37.58]I streamed almost every other day in January, February.
[205:41.55]So those kind of skewed.
[205:44.57]That a little bit retired, by the way.
[205:46.65]Yeah?
[205:47.84]Hey, I'm glad I've been saying that.
[205:50.20]Because it just... Look, here I am.
[205:52.65]Just playing Resident Evil 6.
[205:59.06]Green and retired.
[206:05.72]What do you mean green?
[206:12.82]You guys should do Dark Souls 2 seamless co-op when it comes out.
[206:19.49]Um, maybe.
[206:21.76]I watched Squeaks and Ludwig do that.
[206:23.96]Seemed pretty fun.
[206:29.13]But yeah, I will see you guys in a few days.
[206:32.37]You know what we're probably going to do?
[206:34.36]First promise made.
[206:35.53]The first promise... done.
[206:39.32]Promise kept.
[206:41.41]Uh, probably gonna play hard time.
[206:45.45]We don't even have to wait for January for that one.
[206:52.66]So, see you later.
[206:57.45]Have a wonderful rest of your day, or night for most of you.
[207:03.11]Take care.
[207:04.82]See you later.
[207:07.28]And give your mother a call.
[207:09.25]If you haven't.
[207:11.50]Bye.
