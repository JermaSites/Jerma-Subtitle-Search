[00:26.73]What's your opinion on nutritional yeast?
[00:29.57]I've heard of it on popcorn.
[00:33.33]It has like an umami flavor, right?
[00:39.52]Recycled material?
[00:40.56]Wait, what?
[00:42.08]Did we talk about nutritional yeast already?
[00:46.34]Oh, yeah.
[00:46.56]By the way, what am I doing here?
[00:48.00]Right.
[00:48.30]Okay.
[00:49.06]Well, you know what?
[00:50.44]Oh, shit.
[00:50.66]Ads are going to start.
[00:53.03]Oh, wait.
[00:53.39]No, no.
[00:53.67]I got like three minutes.
[00:54.45]Okay.
[00:58.46]I'm trying to make it better than it was yesterday.
[00:59.92]Instead of waiting, like, 15 minutes to run the first batch so we can get rid of the free rolls.
[01:04.98]Uh, yeah.
[01:08.38]Okay.
[01:08.80]So... I opened up... Remember yesterday?
[01:12.86]We were playing with the Four Horsemen.
[01:13.96]We were hanging out.
[01:15.58]Brought this game up.
[01:16.98]Somebody said, hey, did you see the Northern Lion clip?
[01:18.60]I was like, oh, yeah.
[01:20.92]Sure.
[01:21.26]I watched it.
[01:21.82]I was like, oh, this looks fucking fun.
[01:24.50]It seemed like it was very, very, uh...
[01:27.41]satisfying and of course it's a northern lion stream that's an automatic banger we already all know that uh but yeah I want to try it I opened it and I said hey I'm I want to play this right now it's like well I kind of want to stream it so I'm just streaming I was I was going to just sit here and play this alone so I'm like you know if I I'm no the stream is going to turn on
[01:58.25]I was ready to sit here.
[02:00.51]So let's do it.
[02:02.53]Might as well.
[02:02.91]You're going to rage so bad.
[02:13.00]This is going to be a chill day.
[02:16.38]I'm just going to chill.
[02:18.20]And roll marbles down a table.
[02:24.94]Is it going to be no slow mode today?
[02:27.92]I'm going to leave that to the discretion of the mods.
[02:34.06]He doesn't want to feel lonely.
[02:37.44]No, I'm just saying if I'm going to.
[02:40.69]This is a stream game.
[02:42.01]People like it.
[02:43.07]People like to watch it.
[02:44.09]It's really interesting.
[02:45.75]It gives room for the hang.
[02:47.29]I'm just going to hang out and play it.
[02:48.93]You know what?
[02:49.27]Fuck it.
[02:49.51]I might stream tomorrow too.
[02:50.49]You know what?
[02:50.97]Fuck you.
[02:51.47]I might stream for the next three days.
[02:59.17]17 hour stream.
[02:59.83]No, no, no, no.
[03:01.48]I can't.
[03:09.48]Alright, we're going to do the three minutes of ads.
[03:14.55]I'm gonna... Somebody predicted this and you know what?
[03:17.25]It's just annoying how predictable that I can be.
[03:20.71]Okay, we'll talk about this when I come back.
[03:25.19]But the little routines and little quirks that you do to like one of your buddies, they'll pick up on it.
[03:32.22]There's tens of thousands of you that know all of my bullshit and all my quirks and stuff.
[03:37.16]I cannot hide I can't like oh yeah I'm gonna go make a tea somebody said I bet he makes a tea but he forgets to make his tea I did all right see you in three minutes ads playing see you soon
[05:34.09]I just, uh, I'm here for a sec.
[05:37.51]I just saw somebody say, what the fuck?
[05:39.78]Hey, there's not supposed to be content on ads.
[05:47.38]What am I doing?
[05:47.92]I'm not supposed to be talking.
[05:57.12]Bro, don't talk during the ad.
[05:58.72]I know, I know.
[05:59.42]All right, I'll be back.
[07:08.26]Somebody said, I know you're reading this, you liar.
[07:10.75]I actually never got up.
[07:14.21]Well, no, sorry.
[07:17.27]I'm pacing, and I see, and I'm looking over how much time is left.
[07:20.47]My delicious beverages.
[07:22.84]Tea.
[07:24.48]Did you get water?
[07:35.41]Okay.
[07:36.81]We can get started now.
[07:39.89]So hello, how are you?
[07:45.28]Good to see you.
[07:46.60]Welcome back.
[07:47.12]Uh, okay.
[07:49.16]So we're going to be playing trick shot simulator.
[07:55.44]I have already.
[07:56.36]Okay.
[07:56.84]So remember I told you I played it for a little bit.
[07:58.62]I just was like, I'm going to try this before the stream turned on.
[08:01.96]Uh, I already beat one.
[08:03.50]And I want to ask you guys if this is a good, a good time on this, because I was like, holy shit.
[08:08.20]Thank God they record them.
[08:12.16]So take a look.
[08:13.64]I've done, see, I've done it a few times, like a minute, two minutes.
[08:19.13]Look at this shit.
[08:20.95]I did this in six minutes with 371 tries.
[08:23.63]Is that good?
[08:30.33]That's pretty good, I would imagine, right?
[08:33.86]Here's a video of it.
[08:35.98]Just to show you can prove it, apparently.
[08:38.98]Pretty good.
[08:44.20]Is doing this in six and a half minutes good?
[08:45.98]This is the easiest one.
[08:47.50]Okay.
[08:53.12]So how about this one?
[08:56.77]This one, you got to roll a marble down and it has to land and get right on the dice and stay there.
[09:07.40]Hey, okay, what about sensitivity?
[09:10.08]What's the play for sensitivity?
[09:11.68]Should I turn it way up, way down?
[09:13.42]Like, what do you guys think?
[09:15.28]I thought I just did it right there.
[09:16.34]It has to land on the center of pip.
[09:19.93]Oh, man.
[09:31.15]Should I do low sensitivity and just absolutely just wrench my arm?
[09:38.73]You can do this in real life, too.
[09:40.39]You know that.
[09:43.56]Oh, here's the thing about doing this in real life.
[09:45.26]That's true.
[09:45.92]But here's the problem.
[09:48.76]I don't really want to clean up three or four thousand marbles off the ground.
[09:55.16]And I don't really want to source like ten thousand marbles.
[10:03.73]Oh, it's a little bit slower than that.
[10:10.58]You need enough speed to get down there, but you need to... Come on.
[10:17.42]I'll get it.
[10:20.58]Get one of your servants to do it.
[10:22.40]I don't have fucking servants.
[10:29.36]I've got like... Oh!
[10:31.12]That's it?
[10:34.53]Oh, man.
[10:35.47]I was about to say, holy shit.
[10:40.20]Oh, that sucks.
[10:46.84]Can I bump it into it?
[10:48.04]Can I knock it into each other?
[10:52.37]Damn it.
[10:53.45]That was close.
[10:54.03]It's all right.
[10:55.63]I think I got the right technique down.
[11:02.76]That's it.
[11:03.38]Nope.
[11:07.11]Are full playthrough streams off the table or does it depend on the right game?
[11:12.48]Honestly, it depends on... There's a lot of factors.
[11:14.67]It's the game, but it's also...
[11:19.76]like how much it's also streaming it too because some games that are 30 40 50 hours long if I'm going to do the whole thing on stream that requires a pretty significant commitment nowadays you know it's if I stream on average four to six hours each time I sit down maybe three and a half to five and a half three and a half to six
[11:42.45]At a maximum, you're talking 6, 12, 18, 24, 30.
[11:44.79]You're talking about at least 5 to maybe 10 streams of that game.
[11:49.17]I need to be really into it.
[11:50.19]Because I just don't really stream like that anymore.
[11:54.24]I never really did anyways.
[11:55.66]I wasn't like, oh yeah, I'm going to stream this game every day or whatever.
[11:58.80]Oh no, I lost it.
[12:08.75]How come you're not going to learn Japanese?
[12:13.50]I don't think I can learn another language at this point.
[12:15.78]I really don't think so.
[12:20.02]I have to translate the language like three times before I can say it.
[12:23.42]This dude just hates commitment.
[12:32.97]Okay, duck.
[12:37.79]Get over there.
[12:38.49]Come on.
[12:38.79]That's it.
[12:39.11]That's it right there.
[12:39.79]Bingo.
[12:41.60]What happened to it?
[12:42.42]Oh, I'm bad with the camera.
[12:43.58]I could have switched that faster.
[12:44.95]So it's more hype.
[12:52.27]Oh, that's it.
[12:53.01]I got it.
[12:53.65]And how long was that?
[12:54.61]How long was that?
[12:55.09]180 tries.
[12:55.79]That's fucking nothing.
[12:57.71]I was born to play this game.
[12:58.97]I was born to win at this video game.
[13:09.02]Do you see that curve too?
[13:11.00]I put some spin on that.
[13:12.80]I put some spin on it.
[13:16.94]Six minutes.
[13:18.68]I'm a six minute man.
[13:20.47]I'm a six minute game player when I play video games.
[13:25.07]Alright, this one is...
[13:36.15]You gotta what?
[13:36.75]Get it?
[13:37.33]You gotta get the card.
[13:38.45]I didn't understand this one when I tried it.
[13:41.45]So you've got to get the card to stick in between the two balls?
[13:49.98]Hey, six minutes is a long time.
[13:59.98]Yeah, what the fuck are you?
[14:01.51]All right, we're going to move on from that fucking topic.
[14:07.13]All right.
[14:07.33]This one's a little flick.
[14:08.29]You got to like flick your wrist a little.
[14:09.73]All right.
[14:10.69]That's too much.
[14:16.93]Hmm.
[14:19.57]What is the, okay.
[14:20.43]So the trajectory, it kind of curves from right to left.
[14:27.49]That was pretty close.
[14:42.77]Okay, I feel like this one's going to take me a while.
[14:45.09]The marbles I kind of understood.
[14:47.55]This one I do not.
[14:51.31]Who picks your games, your mom?
[14:59.92]Why are you writing dumb things?
[15:03.72]This is a cool game and a bunch of people are playing it.
[15:14.65]Hey, did your mom write that comment?
[15:19.29]I can do it too.
[15:24.72]You got to change up your... Mom, should I stream today?
[15:31.44]Yeah, but you should play Trick Shot Simulator.
[15:33.30]It took me a while to get this one.
[15:38.06]I think it's the different sensitivities for each game.
[15:40.68]Is that cheating though?
[15:46.71]Sometimes it feels like it just goes way harder.
[15:52.08]That's not cheating.
[15:52.76]I think I want to turn it down.
[15:53.98]For this one, at least.
[15:57.84]Okay, that's a little better.
[16:09.96]You got to throw it a little off to the right and a little harder than that.
[16:15.27]But that's too hard.
[16:16.25]Fuck.
[16:16.68]Even lower.
[16:33.32]You're doing, you're doing, you're not doing so hot.
[16:40.09]So, all right.
[16:41.21]Should I be doing slow drag up and then release or a quick wham and let go?
[16:49.69]I can't really get it close.
[16:54.93]It should be a wham.
[16:55.64]Oh, okay.
[17:00.44]So you want it to be kind of like a little, like a line drive.
[17:14.86]You should put some epic dubstep on it.
[17:16.30]Oh yeah, there is no music or anything.
[17:17.70]I'll put something on in a minute.
[17:24.60]Hmm.
[17:26.90]Go for a straight flush.
[17:31.41]Put on Animal Crossing music.
[17:32.67]Ooh.
[17:36.81]Yeah, I can get the... Oh, that was kind of good.
[17:45.98]How close is this realistically even coming?
[17:58.74]Fuck.
[17:59.80]I'm going to go higher on the sensitivity.
[18:01.24]I'm going to do smaller movement.
[18:04.34]There we go.
[18:17.41]I'm hitting the balls now.
[18:25.64]Damn it.
[18:27.72]I wish the cards didn't disappear.
[18:28.84]It feels like on some of them they don't.
[18:38.56]I got close on like two or three of those.
[18:44.68]Come on.
[18:45.16]I'm so close to getting the right rhythm.
[19:01.46]Fuck.
[19:02.00]Even higher.
[19:04.14]This might be too high, though.
[19:04.94]Oh, that's way too high, but if I go really small, I can go right down the middle.
[19:17.59]How long did it take Northern Line to do this one?
[19:19.91]Like 100 hours?
[19:20.29]That's what I heard?
[19:22.43]Did I hear that right?
[19:33.68]I want to leave this one, but I can't leave.
[19:40.43]It's such a small movement to the right.
[19:52.81]Shit.
[19:53.87]I'll come back to it.
[19:56.21]What's the, oh yeah, this is the ball one.
[19:57.64]Okay.
[19:57.88]This one is, this one seems like it could be kind of fun.
[20:00.84]You're going to bounce the ball.
[20:03.56]into the cup that's all it is it's that simple oh that's it three tries are you kidding me I did that in literally three tries I have to there has to be some kind of a twitch.tv record
[20:29.49]I promise you, I was just throwing 100 of them randomly.
[20:33.60]I threw 100 of them.
[20:36.64]I didn't even, I wasn't even trying to play though.
[20:41.44]Damn, alright.
[20:44.24]That's two minutes.
[20:49.00]Oh, fuck.
[20:49.40]I thought this was going to take longer to do.
[20:52.00]Well, I say that, but I tried a few of these.
[20:55.44]Okay, you can tell the ones that I don't even care about trying.
[21:00.95]See the in progress?
[21:04.03]Dude, I got three.
[21:05.83]I was concerned I wasn't even potentially going to get the top row.
[21:08.30]We're getting the whole top row tonight.
[21:11.96]I can probably... Realistically, I don't know if I'm going to... I did four attempts on this one, and I said, no, no, thank you.
[21:19.74]Yeah, I tried them.
[21:20.28]I just wanted to see what they all were like.
[21:21.86]And a couple of these are absolute no.
[21:24.06]I refuse.
[21:24.72]Okay, well, there we go.
[21:27.48]What's this one?
[21:29.82]Oh, right.
[21:30.26]This one is the... You got to do a half pipe.
[21:37.56]And then it's got to go right in the middle.
[21:46.47]Let that be a first try again.
[21:47.65]No, no way.
[21:52.58]It's got to go fast enough, but... Watch out for the dinosaur.
[21:59.27]You'd probably do something cool with it, right?
[22:01.83]You'd probably skip it over its head.
[22:09.96]Oh, come on.
[22:10.38]That would have been pretty good.
[22:12.18]Clear it.
[22:12.96]A little bit slower and that would have been good.
[22:23.82]too fast that's my favorite color marble um probably I like a nice teal I mean teal is just my favorite color though so that's kind of a given there it is nope wait
[22:51.40]It caught a groove on the desk.
[22:53.55]When are you going to do your lava lamps?
[22:56.35]I don't know.
[22:56.85]I don't know about that.
[22:59.65]I love that idea.
[23:00.77]I really do.
[23:07.13]But the manufacturing game is not... I don't know.
[23:11.70]No.
[23:17.29]If the stars align for some reason, maybe.
[23:19.57]But I love that idea, though.
[23:21.34]It's a super neat idea.
[23:22.46]Alright, hold on.
[23:26.72]Too much shit on the table.
[23:27.52]Alright, I'm trying to see what... It's almost like it has to be moving.
[23:40.15]You can't go too far to the right.
[23:54.31]Yeah, I like teal.
[23:55.29]I like, um, I like green too.
[23:57.53]I like a, like a nice vibrant green.
[24:01.35]Like that one.
[24:05.87]Try to jump over the big one.
[24:06.99]I kind of can.
[24:18.40]That actually might, that actually might work.
[24:38.76]Yeah, but you also poop though.
[24:44.14]Do you guys just like kind of write random sentences nowadays?
[24:53.21]That feels like, it feels like there's a random sentence generator that you guys are all using.
[25:08.71]It's got to be so tight to that right side of the first jump.
[25:16.76]Anything to get you to pay attention to us.
[25:21.80]Oh, wouldn't that make me want to pay attention less?
[25:26.40]Where are your thinking faces?
[25:33.23]Damn it.
[25:34.29]Fat, wait, hold on.
[25:36.37]Come on.
[25:48.42]Bingo.
[25:49.78]Yes.
[25:50.14]No.
[25:52.50]Oh, that hurts a lot actually.
[25:54.24]I didn't anticipate it was going to hurt that bad when you miss like that.
[26:05.45]So that's got to be perfect.
[26:06.70]Perfect.
[26:07.10]Just like the other one.
[26:07.96]Okay.
[26:19.76]Not enough.
[26:23.92]Do a trick shot.
[26:26.87]I feel like I just did it, but it was one hair too fast.
[26:30.87]That's pretty good.
[26:39.96]Favorite dinosaur.
[26:48.48]Uh... Brontosaurus is pretty cool, just because they're huge.
[26:51.84]I remember there was an old Disney ride.
[26:58.55]Um, I believe it was called the... the Universe of Energy.
[27:02.87]I don't think that was the name of the ride.
[27:06.57]But they said that in the ride, they go...
[27:09.91]the universe of energy the universe of energy and then the the screen ellen ellen is in that ride wait ellen's in that ride
[27:25.01]Bill Nye is on that ride.
[27:26.33]Yeah.
[27:26.49]Okay.
[27:26.73]And then as you watch, so when I was younger, this is, I had to have been probably seven or eight years old, by the way.
[27:33.37]Um, I, both my hands just were taken off the computer.
[27:36.77]I was about to just tell a story.
[27:38.33]I was just leaning into the campfire.
[27:39.72]I'm not even playing the game.
[27:43.92]Um, so it starts off with, I don't know.
[27:48.56]I forget if it starts off with a video or it ends with the video.
[27:54.86]But there's a point when, when I was a kid, I was so bored.
[27:58.39]I was like, I don't want to watch a video.
[28:00.57]I don't want to watch this movie.
[28:04.13]I want to go on rides.
[28:05.39]This is, this is lame.
[28:06.75]I don't care about any of this.
[28:07.75]I was like eight.
[28:09.21]And then the screen after the movie, it's like a, it's like a 10 to 20 minutes short or something.
[28:13.88]The screen moves out of the way and you start to, it's a ride.
[28:20.66]And there's brontosauruses and pterodactyls and there's a bunch of animatronics that are just huge.
[28:26.68]And it turned out to be one of my favorite rides at Disney World.
[28:32.51]Like, the screen is like, hey, we know this is a boring video, but just look at this.
[28:36.11]And then you... Damn it.
[28:53.78]I need more brain power for this.
[28:58.40]Oh, I will definitely get this one.
[29:00.48]It's just a matter of when...
[29:17.20]No longer, no longer six minute.
[29:19.86]Now I'm an 11, I'm a 12 minute Andy now.
[29:26.90]Don't people sometimes spend like hours on these?
[29:29.97]Do I have the patience to do what I'm doing right now from more than two or three hours?
[29:36.17]Just like this right here.
[29:38.59]Actually might.
[29:39.15]It's not going to take that long though because I got it right here.
[29:59.03]I could try the spam technique and see if one actually just rolls over there.
[30:07.24]Holy shit, it almost worked.
[30:10.76]Oh my god, what is this one doing?
[30:21.39]This one I feel like actually has a chance.
[30:33.83]No, why is it going?
[30:35.27]What?
[30:39.89]Excuse me?
[30:54.00]Come on, that's the one right there.
[30:55.50]Just stay on the trajectory.
[30:56.84]Don't go to the left.
[30:59.12]No, why do they all do that?
[31:00.42]Are there grooves in the table?
[31:16.54]Shoot it over the ramp.
[31:18.30]It actually doesn't work out as much as you think it would.
[31:25.19]Potential.
[31:26.81]No.
[31:31.09]No.
[31:32.03]Potential.
[31:34.27]Oh!
[31:38.46]Shit.
[31:40.42]That was close.
[31:46.85]Yeah, you got to just, you got to sneak it by that right side of the first ramp.
[31:52.55]Like that.
[31:54.61]No.
[32:07.64]That's got potential.
[32:12.70]Potential, come on, pick it up.
[32:16.49]Oh.
[32:26.83]No, you'll know when it's close when it's got to sneak right by that first one.
[32:36.60]This seems impossible.
[32:37.64]I mean, it's improbable.
[32:42.93]The nature of the game is it is not impossible.
[32:50.24]I've come very close quite a few times here.
[32:52.21]There it is.
[32:55.57]Oh, what are you talking about?
[32:57.95]Why did I just say it like that?
[33:08.67]It seems to still go a little too fast off the ramp.
[33:31.94]You got hit by the slow motion gun?
[33:42.40]What's this song called?
[33:43.50]Uh, what?
[33:50.38]I think the sound... Okay, if you were to click on the TikTok video of this, the audio file would be... Barbells rolling on bench.
[34:01.35]Original sound.
[34:04.09]I think that's what it's called.
[34:14.18]I've only been at this one for 16 minutes.
[34:25.89]potential I still could have no they always veer off to the left I never see the chat comments that you read out loud well I make up most of them so but how am I supposed to read this chat are you serious I just make up comments I look over here and it's gone I just oh my god I was one
[34:49.59]Yeah, most of the time when you hear me talk about like, oh, hey, German, I usually just made it up.
[34:53.55]I don't.
[34:56.27]How am I going to read this?
[35:10.70]The truth has been revealed.
[35:12.28]Well, I made that one up, so I'm just making up.
[35:14.88]I make up all the comments.
[35:23.24]That has potential.
[35:29.46]Finally, we got the truth.
[35:30.96]We got the truth.
[35:33.82]He doesn't.
[35:37.02]No.
[35:47.83]This is a video.
[35:49.71]This is not a video.
[35:50.47]Well, I mean, it is a video.
[35:55.80]This is being, this is being, I am playing this and capturing the game and it is recording it.
[36:04.16]And then in real time, it is uploading that footage.
[36:10.64]for you to watch in as close to real time as possible.
[36:14.42]This is technically a video.
[36:16.40]You actually are watching a video because no matter what happens on Twitch right now, these days, there's always a three to five second delay on everything that you see.
[36:27.14]So yeah, like I recorded the video and you watched it five seconds later.
[36:38.00]There it is.
[36:44.01]Oh, you piece of crap.
[36:47.15]Getting closer.
[36:51.90]Whatever you say, video boy.
[36:53.40]Okay.
[36:58.27]I liked that one.
[37:01.27]That's the only one I liked.
[37:20.96]Everyone always says that... Hold on.
[37:25.11]Oh my god.
[37:26.21]Everybody says that they watch these streams that I do.
[37:28.81]And they're like, oh man, it's like those mobile ads where I... He sucks so bad that I have to get it and do it faster than him.
[37:36.86]This is one of those games, but he ain't gonna do it faster than me.
[37:40.76]It's very difficult.
[37:45.38]So you're gonna be upset by that.
[37:50.53]That's good.
[37:51.29]Potential.
[37:59.37]Come on.
[37:59.83]Right there.
[38:00.51]Right down.
[38:01.15]Right there.
[38:01.97]Right here.
[38:03.64]Potential.
[38:07.78]Can you get angrier every time you miss?
[38:13.24]Hmm.
[38:16.70]I'd have to start very happy.
[38:26.78]Potential.
[38:29.28]Not enough.
[38:35.34]Not enough.
[38:37.10]Not enough.
[38:45.44]Needs more speed right there.
[38:55.32]Could be.
[39:00.58]Who do you think's better?
[39:02.34]Dante or I don't know.
[39:04.26]Like, you mean Dante from Devil May Cry?
[39:06.78]I had a red filter this stream for anger each time you miss.
[39:16.29]Get it?
[39:25.86]Well, but I would have to get mad.
[39:27.70]I want to just like chill and play this.
[39:29.48]That would mean I'd have to get like angry.
[39:36.65]So close.
[39:39.25]That's the, okay.
[39:40.51]It's up there, but you have to get it high enough to get the power, which I'm not getting.
[39:45.41]No.
[39:50.13]Better.
[39:58.06]Still a little too much on it.
[40:09.14]Clear.
[40:18.27]I want to come back to this one, but I know I'm locked in right now and I'm going to get it.
[40:24.48]I will get it.
[40:26.36]You don't come that close like 10 times and not get it.
[40:35.56]Oh, come on.
[40:36.68]More, more, more, more, more, more, more, more, more.
[40:50.18]I can't believe I didn't get it that second or third time.
[40:52.91]The machine is hot.
[40:56.83]you play radical dreamers but isn't radical dreamers a um like a text-based game I'll put some music on in a minute after I get this one I'll put some music on that one could have been it I just reset it I just panic reset
[41:30.51]Damn it.
[41:32.66]I can tell when they're not going to happen.
[41:43.50]Come on.
[41:55.98]I must get it.
[42:04.84]These are getting closer, though.
[42:05.80]These are getting pretty close.
[42:10.30]Can't wait to see this game at AGDQ.
[42:15.48]Actually, kind of true.
[42:16.54]That's a good idea.
[42:24.87]I don't know how you would do this under any kind of pressure, though.
[42:34.37]Potential too fast.
[42:44.26]No, not even where you can.
[42:45.54]It's not even worth changing the camera sometimes, you know what I mean?
[42:55.20]Wait, Radical Dreamer is the song?
[42:56.56]You mean the... That could have been it.
[42:59.39]Why did I press the button?
[43:28.16]This game, this game is griefing me.
[43:41.64]Need a little extra.
[43:44.76]Putting a little bit of extra sauce on it is so much harder than it looks.
[43:57.34]It's cool to watch from this angle, but it's harder to play it.
[44:08.32]One of them will go in.
[44:09.72]Oh my god, it worked!
[44:22.33]That's the closest I've been the whole time.
[44:41.44]I can't, you gotta get it in the middle, Pip.
[44:47.15]Oh, I don't even stream in 864p anymore.
[44:50.38]I stream in 1080.
[44:51.32]And hey, by the way, there wasn't a single fucking difference.
[44:56.32]The stream is just as ugly as it was two months ago.
[45:11.31]There it is.
[45:11.63]Table with the most friction in the world.
[45:34.93]You can't come that close and not do it.
[45:41.92]Let's try that other technique again.
[45:43.42]It seems to work.
[45:49.63]I actually think this will work.
[45:59.54]Trick shot simulator, a.k.a.
[46:03.96]brute force until you win.
[46:06.44]I'm messing up my score, though.
[46:07.54]I don't want to do that.
[46:10.66]I just completely screwed up my, that's going to, that tracks it every time you throw one.
[46:20.63]Camera's fine here.
[46:24.44]No.
[46:26.50]No, not even worth watching.
[46:50.99]I've lost the... I was in a Zen mode there and now it's gone.
[46:59.45]Oh, what's the bottom left one?
[47:01.91]Not correct.
[47:09.07]Sad.
[47:11.48]Very, very sad.
[47:12.72]Yeah, it doesn't count.
[47:16.64]You got to get it in the middle pip.
[47:20.47]I see here's the thing.
[47:21.57]I thought the same thing.
[47:24.72]I saw.
[47:27.76]Oh my God, the same spot.
[47:33.86]It's got an inch to the left a tad.
[47:44.78]It bumped.
[47:51.88]I gotta be better at clearing too.
[47:58.56]Damn it, still not enough on it.
[48:04.67]I said I would be happy.
[48:07.07]Yes, there it is.
[48:08.21]Okay.
[48:09.23]It is exactly, almost exactly 30 minutes.
[48:13.03]I said I would be happy if I could four of these.
[48:14.77]So I've got four of them.
[48:15.53]Let me see that one again.
[48:25.52]Yeah.
[48:25.74]There's this orange one here.
[48:27.87]Nice.
[48:35.27]Do three in a row.
[48:36.17]Now it's easy.
[48:39.16]Three in a row.
[48:43.80]Okay.
[48:44.10]So that's, I could go back to the card one, but we'll do this one.
[48:52.27]So this one you throw badminton birdies and you have to whack it into this cup.
[49:00.06]All right.
[49:07.56]This one.
[49:08.66]Whoa.
[49:09.27]Sensitivity.
[49:25.98]shit come on we need we need music for this hold on hold on okay three more tries and I'll put one two more tries and I'll do music oh that was almost it too
[50:07.34]Okay, what should we put on for music?
[50:11.06]Anybody have any preferences?
[50:19.07]Put on classical music?
[50:20.27]That actually kind of is a good idea.
[50:21.65]What have we got?
[50:29.81]Like Beethoven?
[50:34.86]Okay, I'm going to put on Beethoven.
[50:46.51]Okay, did Beethoven ever...
[50:49.69]Every time I ever hear of Beethoven, it's Beethoven like number nine, Beethoven number eight.
[50:55.82]Beethoven's number five.
[50:57.22]Beethoven is like a fast food restaurant.
[50:59.92]He has like a combo meals.
[51:01.94]It's like, oh, can I get the Beethoven number two, please?
[51:04.02]And it's like, okay, I know what that is.
[51:05.54]I don't know what any of these are.
[51:12.57]Okay, what is the quarter pounder with cheese equivalent for Beethoven?
[51:16.97]You know the one I'm talking about.
[51:19.93]Is it number five or number nine?
[51:24.25]It's number five.
[51:27.77]Beethoven five.
[51:32.68]What's the one that goes... That's five.
[51:52.29]Okay, let me make sure this isn't loud.
[51:54.27]This is going to be loud, isn't it?
[52:00.41]Turn this down.
[52:01.07]Okay, let's see.
[52:06.07]Is this correct?
[52:18.00]I can't hear anything.
[52:25.75]Okay, now I can hear it.
[52:30.71]This is going to give me anxiety.
[52:31.89]I don't want this on for very long.
[52:56.05]What kind of a fucking lunatic do you have to be to be sitting in your room?
[53:00.85]Putting, blasting Beethoven and doing this.
[53:05.20]I mean, I am doing this through proxy.
[53:07.68]So that doesn't, that makes me not a psycho.
[53:11.90]I'm talking about setting all this up and doing this to Beethoven.
[53:15.08]There is a degree of separation here, so it's okay.
[53:39.43]That was it.
[53:39.99]That was close.
[53:40.95]What's the other angle here?
[53:41.83]Oh, okay.
[53:57.73]I wish I could.
[53:58.17]I want to move the camera even further, but I can't.
[54:06.23]It actually messes up how you aim the mouse too if you do that.
[54:22.38]I feel like this would be part of a montage in a movie where the guy starts here and he ends up making like a perpetual energy machine or something like two minutes into this montage.
[54:43.36]I've had a few close calls here.
[54:44.70]Ah, you gotta get it when it's all the way down.
[54:59.43]Damn it, I gotta get this one.
[55:09.13]Now I can't even get the net anymore.
[55:15.53]Okay, I don't think Otto likes Beethoven because he can hear it and he just got up and he's like annoyed that this is playing.
[55:32.79]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, you got to reset.
[55:34.35]Here we go.
[55:52.71]I thought that was it.
[56:01.09]He actually might be hungry.
[56:01.85]Are you hungry?
[56:07.07]Is that the problem?
[56:13.39]How many shuttlecocks does this guy own?
[56:15.12]A lot apparently.
[56:16.08]This is what I'm talking about.
[56:16.72]This is why in real life this is impossible.
[56:18.86]That's why the digital version of these games are always going to be preferred.
[56:24.41]And by the way, if I do this, hold on, I've got like an ad that just came out of nowhere.
[56:34.66]It was Beethoven and I started hearing all this shit.
[56:37.74]All right.
[56:41.66]Do you need it?
[56:42.08]Do you want me to take care of you?
[56:43.60]Do you need food?
[56:44.72]Is that what you need?
[56:45.96]Let me take care of him.
[56:47.24]It's been about an hour anyways.
[56:48.14]Let me, I'm going to get up.
[56:52.26]Yeah, it's been about one hour.
[56:54.00]I do want to start getting up every hour like I used to, at least in the solo stream.
[56:57.33]So let me go take care of him.
[57:00.13]I'll be right back.
[57:05.69]And I'll see you guys in a few minutes, like maybe three to five minutes.
[57:09.05]I ain't going anywhere.
[57:09.71]Don't worry.
[57:12.08]I'll be back.
[61:40.29]Okay, I am back.
[61:42.65]And I am ready to continue.
[61:47.42]So, badminton.
[61:52.48]Any fans of badminton here?
[61:57.30]Anybody else play badminton where there are no rules?
[62:00.47]You just hit it over the net to the other person?
[62:03.35]You don't even play the game?
[62:04.53]I feel like that's how every single person plays that game.
[62:11.10]Let me move this.
[62:11.90]Okay, Beethoven's is back.
[62:21.57]Here it is.
[62:22.01]Alright, one more Beethoven song and then I'm done with Beethoven.
[62:38.18]Wait, this is the same song of Beethoven.
[62:52.26]This one seems like it's very easy, but it's not at all.
[63:03.16]Sensitivity change, what do you think?
[63:16.41]Gotta get in a rhythm too.
[63:24.39]Yeah, sensitivity change for sure.
[63:26.55]That feels too low.
[63:41.84]How does this feel too low and too high at the same time?
[64:14.94]This is psychopath bullshit.
[64:18.24]Yes, I agree.
[64:19.54]But this is, again, it's through proxy.
[64:31.00]When you smash into the guy in Grand Theft Auto, you are not smashing into the guy in your car.
[64:58.61]It needs to be going way faster.
[64:59.97]It's got to be more of a line drive and I keep going through it.
[65:19.80]There we go.
[65:28.13]This one forces you to wait and I kind of don't like that that I have to wait for it.
[65:35.10]Makes me overthink it.
[65:48.07]I'm going to remove all of those.
[65:49.67]You're shooting too late.
[66:00.35]I think it has to come down on it.
[66:02.91]Oh my God, dude, what the fuck?
[66:04.93]All right, so I, yeah, I know.
[66:14.24]Why are you getting at?
[66:15.10]I have YouTube premium.
[66:17.26]The problem is I'm not always logged in.
[66:34.06]Have you watched Tron yet?
[66:35.38]Uh... No?
[66:40.74]The old one or the new ones?
[66:42.28]Aren't there like three of them now?
[66:44.73]Like Tron, Age of the Electromagnetic Destruction.
[66:48.29]I've not seen those ones, no.
[66:50.93]Tron, Age of Ultron or something.
[66:52.87]Whatever the fuck it is.
[67:06.95]shit now don't call this the wall I I I made that one up see I made that comment up all right no more beethoven let's put on pluck we always go back to pluck
[67:41.52]Now this is what I'm talking about.
[67:42.68]I'll get it in probably 10 minutes now.
[67:53.93]Alright, let's go.
[68:11.62]Okay, did anybody play this game silently?
[68:15.43]Any streamers, I mean.
[68:16.61]I feel like that's the way to do it.
[68:21.07]Just be quiet and just stare at the screen.
[68:26.77]Although some would say that the nature of sort of not caring and just kind of talking about nothing and just, oh, what the fuck was that?
[68:38.22]That went around the room like four times.
[68:59.48]I love that sound, that... How long have I been on this one?
[69:08.41]Ooh, okay.
[69:09.33]30 minutes is the longest I've been on one.
[69:13.63]This one's not even nearly as complicated as the other one.
[69:15.69]It shouldn't take me that much longer.
[69:16.89]Come on.
[69:49.01]I gotta get in the center more.
[69:52.55]Way too off to the left side.
[69:53.99]Strategy's not working.
[70:17.82]Hmm, maybe further out.
[70:29.74]No, you don't want to go too far out because.
[70:31.20]It will knock it into the air and not down.
[70:48.90]Is there a speed run for this game, you think?
[70:50.06]Oh, there absolutely is.
[70:51.08]I don't know yet, but how long has this game been out?
[70:55.92]Like a week or two?
[70:56.48]It's only been out like a week.
[71:14.40]That's close.
[71:17.74]Alright, 10 more tries and I'm going to go to the next one.
[71:24.39]I hate this one.
[71:45.69]People thought I was going to get mad at this game.
[71:49.12]I'm just hanging out.
[71:54.10]This is like the least annoyed I think I've ever been in a game like this.
[72:00.71]I'm just chilling right now.
[72:02.61]This is like a chill day.
[72:14.35]You can definitely hear all that, by the way.
[72:15.91]Whatever.
[72:16.21]Sounds like I just bit into somebody and drank a bunch of blood out of them.
[72:23.67]Are you just... Are you chill... I'm just chilling.
[72:41.33]Come on.
[72:45.07]it right here ready this one that one that one this one this one that one all right I'm moving on
[73:13.86]It's got to be so perfect.
[73:16.68]I can't believe it bounced in and out like five times on that one I did before.
[73:37.88]Okay.
[73:38.60]I got to get out.
[73:45.60]OK, did this one that one?
[73:50.18]A dart.
[73:52.29]This one you have to shoot a dart through the ball into the bullseye.
[74:01.85]Then the moment you have to wait.
[74:07.58]First of all, getting a bullseye is already going to be insane.
[74:18.72]Getting that right trajectory every time.
[74:20.84]No way.
[74:23.02]This one, the sensitivity is going to go way up, like all the way, I think.
[74:57.63]Damn it.
[75:03.37]I think those are pretty good.
[75:04.67]Those are hitting at least.
[75:22.06]I got an achievement for being so bad.
[75:42.67]to the music okay it's impossible to get that correct the nuance of getting a bullseye with the mouse here is is crazy
[76:23.09]Just hitting this thing out of the air is going to be insane.
[76:25.79]That was close.
[76:27.09]I just did it.
[76:27.57]Imagine getting this first try.
[77:02.20]this music it's like if you don't know what this is you're probably like what the am I listening to damn it I don't think I've even hit the ball once
[77:45.97]That's close.
[78:12.98]This one's impossible.
[78:17.95]It's when you have to bounce it off of all the pans and buckets and it has to go into the cup.
[78:31.43]Sensitivity is... gotta come down.
[78:33.71]Alright, which one do I have to hit first?
[78:47.26]Okay, that way.
[78:53.96]This one's fun.
[78:56.84]Oh, I almost got it.
[79:01.83]Oh, he almost got it.
[79:02.99]He almost got it.
[79:04.31]I mean, I mean, I almost got it.
[79:05.91]I mean, I almost got it.
[79:09.43]I almost got it.
[79:11.79]I'm not watching somebody else play this.
[79:23.97]I'll get this one for sure.
[79:25.30]Just a question of getting in the right angle.
[79:36.70]It's that bottom right corner.
[79:38.56]You gotta get it.
[79:39.26]There it is.
[79:44.45]You're cheating and lying to people.
[79:48.76]Well, it would be really hard for me to cheat, for me to say left side, right side, left side, right side, straight, straight, straight, left, right, left, right, straight, straight, straight, straight, down, down, left, left, left, left, left, left, right, left, right, left, right, right, right, right, right, left.
[80:04.83]Remembering that and memorizing that exactly as that was, no human can probably do that.
[80:12.71]So, there you go, I just proved it to you.
[80:19.39]I almost got it that second try too.
[80:23.43]Maybe it's a little bit higher.
[80:24.35]I think it's up on like the top left side.
[80:39.42]Damn it, that was it.
[81:01.27]But you're not human Jerma Some of you guys need to stop eating fucking food after midnight
[81:32.81]There's too many balls out clear it that's better Is it right in the middle or is that top left zone up there Just throw it directly into the cup
[82:03.30]What?
[82:04.00]Oh, I can do that?
[82:04.82]Well, that's not really a trick shot, is it?
[82:11.66]I just did it.
[82:13.51]What?
[82:13.79]Well, that's kind of not... Okay.
[82:25.78]Well, hold on.
[82:26.62]I want to get it the right way.
[82:30.40]I technically did complete it.
[82:31.98]That's right.
[82:39.50]I just got an achievement.
[82:40.18]Clear the bouncing ball saga.
[82:41.88]I don't know what I did.
[82:46.33]I did get an achievement for that and it effectively said I cheated.
[82:48.55]It said you did it without bouncing it.
[82:50.75]Hey, I'll take the W though.
[83:18.48]This one's impossible.
[83:23.00]Well, I almost got it.
[83:35.77]Oh, I also got this dinosaur game that I've wanted to play for awhile.
[83:42.41]Called Zombie Dinos, I think.
[83:46.96]Very, very weird looking.
[83:52.14]Oh, I remember this.
[83:52.70]This is the moment I put my fingers in the air and I did the dance with my fingers.
[83:55.84]Because that's what I was just, that's what I would have just done right now.
[84:16.08]Oh.
[84:19.20]Close.
[84:23.45]Come on.
[84:30.41]I had to hit the cup again.
[84:37.92]Also, I have to beat Nancy Drew.
[84:41.98]Oh what did it hit another ball?
[84:43.60]What the hell is that?
[84:44.28]Why did it stall in the air?
[84:47.74]That actually stalled out in the air.
[85:10.32]Alright, I'm going too fast.
[85:11.60]Am I going to play Sims 2 again?
[85:14.51]I don't know.
[85:18.15]There's something about having to get that game set up with a bunch of like mods and game tweaks and game modifications for them to release the whole thing with every expansion pack three days later without any prior announcements, by the way.
[85:37.12]It just happened.
[85:37.96]They just were like, oh, by the way, we're re-releasing all that and you can buy it again.
[85:42.06]I had to get a disk drive for that shit.
[85:46.24]Those two weirdos.
[85:47.60]We don't need to see.
[85:48.40]You know what?
[85:48.78]We don't need to see what those guys are doing.
[85:57.59]We can start a new family.
[86:00.83]If I play the other one.
[86:01.61]Because that has all the expansion packs.
[86:09.49]Apparently it wasn't that good for release.
[86:13.27]Yeah, I heard that it was kind of just the original games without very many fixes.
[86:19.39]I did see they were patch notes today though or within over the last day or so.
[86:24.40]I did see in quotes stability improvements in the latest patch notes.
[86:38.13]Clean.
[86:43.47]Oh, come on.
[86:44.71]That was actually annoying.
[86:46.45]I actually could be very annoyed by that.
[87:08.02]That would have gone in in real life.
[87:11.78]Probably.
[87:14.52]That was close.
[87:25.91]This angle is really no better.
[87:42.84]There it is.
[87:49.39]This is a pissing angle.
[87:54.71]Kind of.
[88:03.84]I wonder if there's a better way to bounce it.
[88:06.72]Definitely not.
[88:07.66]This is the only way to do this.
[88:22.62]Damn it.
[88:28.52]Somebody had a German themed costume party on the subreddit.
[88:33.66]What the fuck?
[88:41.30]What did you all dress up in?
[88:42.72]Gray shirts and jogging pants?
[88:49.46]With like one or two Pac-Man themed t-shirts.
[89:20.98]I had this one too, and now it's gone.
[89:23.08]And it's never returning.
[89:27.00]I'm never going to get it.
[89:36.67]Not that mentality, right?
[89:46.10]There it is.
[89:50.00]You can tell when it's about to go.
[89:51.82]You just know right when you throw it.
[90:08.96]There it is.
[90:09.36]Nope.
[90:10.90]What's the point of the game?
[90:12.50]To get the ball into the hole by bouncing.
[90:16.48]I've had a guide up this whole time, so I am cheating.
[90:31.29]I'm sorry, but I'm looking at the guide.
[90:44.80]Yeah, the guide says.
[90:48.03]Your elbow needs to be at when you get to 90 degrees with your elbow and your wrist up.
[90:53.85]That's when you want to let it go right at 90 degrees.
[91:06.67]It also says got yeah I got you.
[91:09.38]It's part of the guide too.
[91:17.16]Don't plus two that.
[91:18.10]That's fucking unbelievable.
[91:19.56]Don't do that.
[91:25.02]Don't minus two it either.
[91:26.08]There it is.
[91:37.24]There it is.
[91:38.49]There it is.
[91:40.63]There it is.
[91:44.71]Oh, okay, so if I make a World of Warcraft character, which I already have.
[91:48.92]I've played it with italics already, okay?
[91:52.42]I've already been playing, alright?
[91:53.80]So, shut up.
[91:56.20]Oh!
[91:56.36]Did I knock it out of the air?
[91:57.30]I think I knocked it out of the air.
[91:59.56]I knocked it out of the air, I think, with the other ball.
[92:04.63]Did I?
[92:05.01]Or did it just not go in?
[92:09.81]That was actually so messed up.
[92:19.90]Yeah, I've got a couple of characters already.
[92:25.20]I'm terrified to do anything though.
[92:27.66]I've almost died so many times.
[92:30.14]And they have all been insanely high stress situations.
[92:36.16]It's like smoking a pack of cigarettes.
[92:38.02]Every time, I'm convinced, every time you almost die in WoW Hardcore, it's as if your body smoked a pack of cigarettes.
[92:57.08]I can't believe that one didn't go in.
[92:58.46]So it feels good.
[93:08.75]No.
[93:08.97]I don't smoke cigarettes.
[93:13.89]Come on.
[93:15.76]What gear is it?
[93:22.38]Have you ever smoked a cigarette?
[93:23.22]I have smoked a cigarette before.
[93:25.88]And I, you know, like, oh, I'm going to try to smoke a cigarette.
[93:30.31]And I'm just like, that was stupid.
[93:32.29]I'm going to unfollow you.
[93:47.76]Yeah, unfollow me because when I like 20 years ago.
[93:54.41]I tried a cigarette.
[93:55.93]It was fucking stupid.
[93:57.73]There was no reason for me to do it.
[93:58.91]If you're thinking about smoking a cigarette, you're just like, you know what?
[94:04.43]Just let me tell you from first-hand experience.
[94:07.36]It's not worth doing it.
[94:12.42]I'm not going to tell anybody what to do and what not to do.
[94:16.96]I'm just telling you that be careful and it's a fucking bad idea.
[94:37.22]Doesn't taste good.
[94:47.89]What's a cigarette?
[94:51.07]Good.
[94:52.21]Don't look, don't, nobody, nobody tell that person.
[95:00.09]There it is.
[95:01.07]Oh my God.
[95:01.77]I just kicking my feet in anger.
[95:13.39]Now, I'm not going to sit here and be like, I am perfect in every way and I don't ever do anything bad.
[95:18.69]And no, that would be stupid if I were to tell you that.
[95:25.46]Just take care of yourself and be careful.
[95:26.64]All right.
[95:50.28]Should farting be made illegal?
[95:54.24]I think public farting should be made illegal.
[96:01.41]Not that it ever happens, but don't you not want to have to experience that?
[96:09.53]Somebody farting and getting arrested.
[96:17.78]Somebody like rips ass in the movie theater and you see him getting taken out in cuffs.
[96:21.73]I almost had it again.
[96:44.00]Yeah.
[96:44.28]Yeah.
[96:45.36]You imagine how many you'd like.
[96:48.67]Somebody farted.
[96:49.89]Excuse me.
[96:50.47]I'm just calling because I was at a movie theater.
[96:52.67]Me and my husband were watching fucking whatever the fucking popular movie nowadays is.
[96:59.86]I don't know.
[97:00.36]What movie is in the theater right now?
[97:02.06]I don't know.
[97:02.54]The Willy Wonka prequel.
[97:03.70]We're at the Willy Wonka prequel.
[97:05.68]And somebody just farted in front of us.
[97:08.04]And yeah, I would like to press charges.
[97:24.92]Come on, do it.
[97:29.16]I think this might be the longest one.
[97:32.89]14 minutes?
[97:34.13]I'm choking.
[97:35.63]I'm shocked.
[97:36.19]I thought it's been 40 minutes.
[97:54.20]Imagine being the first person to fart around aliens.
[98:02.25]It's a good bait question for this channel in particular because I know I've jokingly gone over aliens before.
[98:20.07]Well, the follow-up to that is the alien is the one that went to the movies and didn't know our laws.
[98:26.16]And the alien is the one that gets arrested.
[98:34.14]You were high and you went on a four-hour rant.
[98:36.30]That did not happen.
[98:49.06]This makes satisfying sound effects, though.
[98:50.64]That's a good thing.
[98:52.66]Come on.
[99:06.95]It was actually 40 minutes.
[99:13.14]Yeah, that's fine.
[99:15.97]40 minutes is a perfectly normal, good conversation to have.
[99:36.35]This one's definitely coming soon here.
[99:44.02]consistently gotten close to that cup quite a few times.
[99:46.38]I actually really like this one.
[99:59.17]I don't even mind sitting here doing this all day.
[100:01.11]It's fun.
[100:09.34]Come on.
[100:10.32]Get it.
[100:10.80]Right here.
[100:22.43]This is like, um, like the carnival games where you have to... Hold on.
[100:31.42]Like, is it better to get it on the line drive or on the bounce down, I wonder?
[100:51.22]Why not just throw it into the cup?
[100:52.34]I did that already.
[100:53.19]It beats the level, but you don't get credit for it.
[100:56.01]It says, haha, you cheated.
[100:57.23]It says, congratulations, you did it, but you didn't do it right.
[101:02.33]And I think I can get this one.
[101:03.47]I mean, I almost have like five to ten times.
[101:07.40]There it is.
[101:28.27]Come on.
[101:30.07]This is mind numbing.
[101:31.95]It's kind of mind numbing in a good way, though.
[101:34.77]Like I said, I don't mind doing this.
[101:36.29]It's... Because I know I'm going to get it.
[101:50.18]My goal was to come to this stream...
[101:54.76]and hopefully get three or four of these in multiple hours.
[102:01.00]I've already done five of them and it's been like an hour and 25 minutes.
[102:07.20]I'm completely fulfilled right now.
[102:09.62]You know when you go into something with like a goal and you don't even think you're going to hit that goal, but you hit it so quickly and you're just like, holy shit.
[102:16.68]I'm happy.
[102:17.18]This is great.
[102:20.24]I could not get another one the whole entire rest of the stream and I'm totally fulfilled.
[102:34.44]Change the angle a little.
[102:35.94]No, almost.
[102:42.19]No, you have to get this one too.
[102:43.63]I'm definitely going to get this one.
[102:49.07]You don't come as close as I have that many times and have it not go in.
[102:59.72]And then everybody can write, I was here.
[103:20.52]I was here resident sleeper.
[103:22.06]Well, I'm glad you're relaxed
[103:27.61]Hey, I'll just tell you, resident sleeper doesn't work on this channel anymore.
[103:31.70]Typically, years ago, I would look at somebody saying resident sleeper and go, oh, fuck.
[103:36.82]Oh, fuck, that person's bored.
[103:38.10]Oh, my God, one person is bored.
[103:39.32]Oh, my God, what do I do?
[103:40.12]Okay, I have to just look crazy.
[103:41.13]Something's going to happen.
[103:42.43]That person's bored.
[103:44.45]I am resident sleeper right now.
[103:45.71]I'm literally laying down on my back playing this.
[103:47.81]So we're good.
[103:49.99]I'm glad you're relaxed.
[104:02.52]Imagine laying down on your back and doing a podcast.
[104:06.46]Cause that's what, let's be honest.
[104:09.12]A stream, a stream is a, is effectively a, just a radio show.
[104:15.97]That's kind of what it is.
[104:17.99]People run their streams differently.
[104:19.21]So we play different games.
[104:20.65]Some people play exclusive games.
[104:22.23]Some people do variety.
[104:23.05]Some people do IRL.
[104:24.63]It's kind of like a giant radio show where you just have a microphone and you're just talking about whatever you want to talk about or whatever that person's stream is.
[104:36.76]Bro, you're sleeping like Dracula.
[104:40.02]I'm not standing up sleeping with my blank.
[104:42.76]What do you mean laying down on my back upright?
[104:45.18]No, I'm not upright.
[104:57.29]But I just imagine turning on, you know, the AM radio station or the FM radio station.
[105:04.21]And the talk show host is lying down on his back.
[105:08.07]Or you imagine like Conan O'Brien, you turned on Conan and he's not at his desk.
[105:12.29]He's laying down in bed.
[105:14.83]Doing like interviews with people, just laying down.
[105:29.81]Shit.
[105:41.80]When you say sleeping like Dracula, you mean he sleeps in a coffin.
[105:45.02]A bat sleeps.
[105:46.39]I don't know what that... That person's drunk, okay?
[105:51.08]They wrote two comments ago.
[105:52.64]Dude, I'm shit-faced.
[106:17.90]Stop slandering that guy.
[106:33.73]Block is still hitting pretty hard.
[106:41.25]Making up more messages.
[106:45.93]I thought that was it and I thought I was free of this level.
[107:04.21]Besides Ball Fondler, what's the worst chat message you've ever read?
[107:08.09]All of them.
[107:20.87]I love saying stuff like that because there's always like one Omeglel in there.
[107:25.15]I am doing that.
[107:30.35]I'm making that joke for like the one guy.
[107:32.57]You know what I mean?
[107:33.03]There's like two people that laughed at that.
[107:35.45]That was for you.
[107:55.98]This kind of fits the music.
[108:13.54]Shit.
[108:13.85]I can barely hear the music.
[108:23.63]I don't know, I can't do a worse chat message of all time.
[108:28.19]Because here's the thing.
[108:30.73]Saying what the worst is, there's always going to be people here that will be like, oh, that's the worst message.
[108:36.82]Just wait and watch me.
[108:38.22]I don't want to put goalposts up for people to be even more ridiculous.
[109:13.89]What's worse than that one?
[109:14.97]I don't know.
[109:23.48]Deleted by moderator.
[109:25.58]That's funny.
[109:37.51]How much, what am I at?
[109:40.41]All right, 27 minutes.
[109:41.49]I'm almost at all time length of a attempt here.
[110:07.83]Can I have my pots back?
[110:08.75]I have to cook dinner.
[110:11.09]No.
[110:12.03]We're playing a game with it.
[110:13.61]Okay?
[110:14.37]We're playing a game with them.
[110:19.46]Just order fucking McDonald's.
[110:21.16]I don't know.
[110:24.72]Just order something.
[110:40.51]Shit, I'm starting to lose the Vanessa on this one.
[110:54.63]Shit, I've lost it.
[111:03.53]I've lost it.
[111:08.10]No!
[111:22.13]damn it uh sleep like dracula I have to sleep with your legs touching the floor uh legs touching the floor that just I could sleep on the ground that's easy I wouldn't enjoy it but that'd be better than having to sleep standing up
[111:58.41]Alright, I gotta pull the plug on this one for now.
[112:02.76]I lost the finesse on it.
[112:06.61]You need a fresh pair of eyes on it.
[112:17.85]So we all know how this works.
[112:19.79]From the moment that a streamer says that they're done, it's about 20 minutes after that.
[112:25.84]But I'm setting up the fact that it's... I'm setting it up.
[112:30.26]I'm giving myself that 20 minute window here.
[112:39.30]Look at where that landed.
[112:40.18]Come on.
[112:42.79]Don't end the stream.
[112:44.09]I'm not ending the stream.
[112:53.83]Hey, it's lazy Sunday.
[112:57.95]On a Friday.
[112:59.25]Is it Thursday?
[112:59.85]I don't even know what day it is.
[113:06.27]Come on.
[113:07.79]That's Thursday.
[113:09.79]I know it's Thursday.
[113:14.20]God, you can't even just make up a dumb thing and people just think you're fucking serious.
[113:22.12]Come on.
[113:43.02]No one takes you seriously.
[113:48.18]Good.
[113:58.99]What a disaster that would be if I had to be taken seriously.
[114:08.40]Now we have our moments.
[114:09.54]I've got my
[114:12.21]I've had plenty of real moments on stream, even though, you know, we fuck around a lot.
[114:16.45]I mess around a lot.
[114:17.81]Always have, and I always will.
[114:19.01]I'm on!
[114:26.34]Come on.
[114:33.10]Mom's gonna be pissed when she sees the mess you've made?
[114:37.18]Honestly, not really.
[114:40.82]If these are ping pong balls, that's not... There's zero damage can be done with a ping pong ball.
[114:49.06]No mess.
[114:49.99]It's just a ping pong ball.
[114:51.19]I would be fine with this.
[114:55.47]If I were to come home and, you know, my son or daughter was sitting in the living room doing this, I'd be like, whoa.
[115:05.75]Oh, it's just ping pong balls.
[115:07.83]Oh, cool.
[115:08.45]And then I would want to try doing it.
[115:11.64]The second I saw the video camera, though, or the phone that was making this for, like, YouTube shorts or something, I'm gonna be like, son, come here, sit down.
[115:20.00]Sit down with me for a second.
[115:21.54]Or, you know, daughter, come here, sit down with me for a second.
[115:25.65]And I would have to give them a, like, we're not doing this discussion.
[115:35.27]Son, we're not gonna be the fucking family that plays all the games, okay?
[115:39.94]We're not doing that.
[115:41.73]We're not gonna do the... I know it's really fun.
[115:45.20]It sounds really fun, but I ain't doing that.
[115:48.34]Um... And go to your fucking room.
[116:07.50]By the way, how do you even have an iPhone?
[116:12.32]I ain't getting you one of those.
[116:13.38]No, my kid's gonna need to be 25 before he gets an iPhone.
[116:22.52]Okay.
[116:32.46]No, I'm sorry, son.
[116:33.92]You gotta be 30 to have an iPhone.
[116:37.09]That's just the rules of the house.
[116:46.06]You're gonna be using two cans and a string?
[116:58.89]Hey, that's reliable.
[117:08.47]Okay, I've never had one of the balls veer to the right.
[117:11.77]What does that mean?
[117:19.88]Why do you have pesticide buckets in your living room?
[117:22.90]I don't live here.
[117:23.84]What you should have said is, why does this character that you are controlling, who you are a proxy for, have that in their living room?
[117:37.27]That's what you should have said.
[117:55.67]This is not a living room.
[117:57.79]Okay.
[117:59.69]No, it... It's not.
[118:01.73]Okay, what... Wait.
[118:05.90]This is a living room.
[118:07.66]What I'm looking at right now.
[118:08.88]I have not moved my head up the whole time.
[118:11.34]My chin has been on my chest the whole time.
[118:15.22]If you asked me, this to me, this is a living room.
[118:17.38]Oh yeah, they got a couch, we got the rug, we got the area, we've got the TV, but I'd never put my head up.
[118:24.23]I didn't know any of this was here until right now.
[118:38.54]That's the one.
[118:38.96]36 minutes.
[118:44.70]Oh my God.
[118:55.09]This is a doozy.
[119:09.01]Can you move around and look at stuff?
[119:10.73]I am locked in here.
[119:11.85]I can change the camera angle, but it's actually it's kind of hard to play without looking straight on it.
[119:34.63]I need a little more speed on it.
[119:39.19]It's already been an hour.
[119:40.26]This is actually kind of nice.
[119:44.46]I'm just kind of hanging out.
[119:52.88]Come on, that was so in there.
[119:59.74]Just watch chat, put some, you're going to put some on it.
[120:02.28]Wait, will you ever smoke weed on stream?
[120:06.06]Probably not.
[120:07.72]I would say definitely not.
[120:13.90]It's the same reason why I kind of don't drink or have like drinks on stream anymore.
[120:25.11]Occasionally it can be fun, but I don't know.
[120:32.21]Have a glass of wine or two or three.
[120:34.25]I don't know.
[120:35.67]I haven't done that in a very long time, though.
[120:37.13]It's been probably years.
[120:38.33]Is that even true?
[120:41.78]I think so.
[120:43.80]It's been at least like a year or two.
[120:56.55]Yeah, I'm going to get up in a minute.
[120:59.13]Do another stretch.
[121:13.85]I think I said this before, but the reason why I wasn't doing like hourly breaks for the last few streams is because doing co-op stuff that probably will never happen unless we say, hey, does anybody want to take a break?
[121:29.54]Coordinating like, oh, hey, guys, everyone get up.
[121:31.62]It's an hour.
[121:32.86]No, that's not going to happen.
[121:47.17]Like, I would rather just have consumed alcohol or marijuana.
[121:54.37]Why does he say it like that?
[121:55.83]Okay, listen.
[121:58.63]You smoke weed, you smoke weed.
[122:00.36]If it's illegal where you are, just fucking be careful and don't be fucking stupid about it.
[122:03.76]Same thing with alcohol.
[122:06.74]Hey, you know, everything can just kind of boil down.
[122:08.92]Just don't be fucking stupid about it.
[122:17.78]but but like a I am today is the day I'm gonna drink and do the no I'll just have a few drinks I don't know all right I'm gonna get up stretch my legs a little uh I want another drink
[122:45.06]Take a break so I can check on some stuff.
[122:47.36]Yep, I'm going to get up in just a second.
[122:52.45]One more second.
[122:54.81]Come on.
[122:55.27]Right here before I go on a little break.
[122:56.69]Come on.
[123:00.97]Oh, come on.
[123:01.45]That would have been perfect.
[123:02.57]All right, fine.
[123:03.15]Fuck it.
[123:03.37]I'm out of here.
[123:10.80]Come on.
[123:13.04]So close.
[123:17.91]I'll get it when I sit down.
[123:23.37]I'll be right back.
[123:25.31]Ads are going to kick in here for a few minutes and I'll be back.
[123:29.54]I'll see you guys very shortly.
[127:21.63]Uh, we, uh, need a new soundtrack.
[127:28.93]What did I say?
[127:29.37]Somebody said something earlier.
[127:30.21]I wanted to remember it for later.
[127:41.94]Something chill, something not so high energy.
[127:56.86]Ruinscape.
[127:58.58]I keep hearing about Ruinscape.
[128:05.87]Kingsway.
[128:08.67]Kingsway.
[128:12.10]What is Kingsway?
[128:21.26]Wait, didn't I, did I play this game?
[128:27.78]I feel like I played this.
[128:28.76]Ooh, this is kind of nice.
[128:37.00]Okay.
[128:45.02]Welcome back.
[128:46.38]Uh, if you're just joining us, uh, we're doing this.
[129:00.31]I was thinking about doing an Omega Gaming weekend.
[129:12.68]Hmm.
[129:14.84]I got this.
[129:16.53]I just turned this on today.
[129:17.45]I just felt like playing it.
[129:19.11]I was going to play this alone, just sitting here.
[129:28.76]It's kind of one of those iPad games that I would just play in bed lying down.
[129:31.54]I figured I'd turn it on, but for the weekend.
[129:35.64]That was what in.
[129:45.93]We'll see.
[129:46.45]I want to play this dinosaur game.
[129:49.35]No, my God, what happened?
[129:52.35]I wish you could replay.
[129:54.47]I think I knocked it out of the air.
[130:02.23]No patience.
[130:14.28]Yeah, this one you cannot throw a second one.
[130:18.02]Even if you think you have to.
[130:19.70]Do not do it.
[130:33.92]Alright, what should I play in WoW Hardcore?
[130:38.16]And if I do that, I'm going to just be playing.
[130:41.81]I'm going to be hanging out and just chilling and playing it.
[130:44.83]I've not committed to it yet, but... I have already have a Hunter.
[130:52.41]I have a Warlock.
[130:56.70]At different levels.
[130:57.86]Nobody's that high.
[130:59.12]They're all like under 30.
[131:01.00]35, I think.
[131:15.38]I saw a lot of druid.
[131:17.44]Definitely not mage.
[131:18.80]I can't handle mage.
[131:23.60]Mage is like the best class in classic, but mage and warrior, right?
[131:27.62]Like the two big ones.
[131:34.34]I love shadow priest, but shadow priest is kind of absolute dog shit until like an expansion or two from classic.
[131:42.50]It was great for PvP, but I don't remember it being particularly great after, you know, a certain level.
[131:50.89]Mage is easy.
[132:02.53]It's really easy to grab.
[132:04.50]Accidentally pull two or three things in the game, though, and you're just dead if you're a mage.
[132:08.84]Well, if you're a bad mage like I would be.
[132:26.24]This one is just going to be the bane of all my entire existence, isn't it?
[132:41.87]I think this is going to go over an hour.
[132:47.93]Close.
[132:53.39]I gotta get a new set of eyes on it.
[133:03.62]anyways to answer the question earlier no I don't have a plan to do a like let's get up and scream I would just have a couple drinks and just do whatever also guys I know a lot of people kind of don't I can't believe this or don't understand this
[133:32.66]But I'm like 40.
[133:35.08]I can't really do that anymore.
[133:37.82]It doesn't really work anymore.
[133:40.18]I'm not like 25 anymore.
[133:45.06]So being like, yeah, let's go!
[133:47.68]Shot, shot, shot, shot, shot, shot.
[133:50.57]After the first shot of that song, I'm like, you know what?
[133:55.31]What a night that was.
[133:56.65]Okay, wowee.
[133:59.23]Getting a little bit sleepy though.
[134:35.64]You are very- you are wise.
[134:40.00]Now drinking always just made me kind of feel like shit, honestly.
[134:49.39]I would drink, even if I drank one drink or 10, it really didn't matter.
[134:54.06]I was going to feel terrible for at least a day or two.
[135:15.05]All right, will prediction.
[135:18.53]Will I get this?
[135:22.17]Before an hour and 30 minutes.
[135:26.26]What do you think?
[135:30.32]That's a that's a good bet.
[135:42.52]Being sober is an amazing feature.
[135:46.66]Well, I'm not totally sober.
[135:48.22]I mean, I do drink and I do smoke weed sometimes.
[135:55.50]I do consume those things.
[135:57.70]I just... I don't know.
[135:59.90]Sometimes you can be like, yeah, this is great.
[136:01.77]I can't wait to do this all the time.
[136:03.05]It's easy to kind of go down that path. ...
[136:26.04]uh the only time I ever saw you drink is when you chugged a wine bottle and puked I did not that did not happen on stream what did I might have just made that up too
[136:52.64]Alright, let's see.
[136:53.14]So what I got I have until 1 hour 30 minutes.
[137:16.10]Moderation Andy.
[137:19.93]Oh.
[137:24.55]Yeah, but I'm full of shit too, though.
[137:26.93]You try to live the best life you can, right?
[137:36.00]There's been plenty of times when, you know, moderation, of course, like a Benjamin Franklin.
[137:41.94]Of course I talk about him and all things in moderation.
[137:44.91]Yeah, guys, I've eaten a fucking pizza three days in a row.
[137:46.77]You know what I mean?
[137:48.09]What the fuck just happened?
[137:49.31]Why did it bounce like three times?
[137:54.57]What?
[138:03.65]It actually bounced out three different times.
[138:20.67]Moderation also is a cheat day as well.
[138:26.79]You know, I think just being conscious of the things that you're doing, even if you're doing it a lot is at least enough of a, like you at least are aware.
[138:41.71]When you start to become not aware, that's a problem.
[138:52.61]Conscious Andy.
[138:54.94]Okay.
[138:59.29]Ben Franklin had 10 human skeletons in his basement.
[139:07.18]We don't know that, though.
[139:08.46]We don't know that.
[139:16.97]It's true.
[139:17.79]We don't know that.
[139:30.52]Make sure to put allegedly by the way in front of that He's in hell
[139:58.20]Why does he love Ben Franklin so much?
[140:00.06]Okay, you know, let a guy watch the HBO John Adams miniseries and... I feel like, wow, this is, wow, this is so intense.
[140:27.87]And then all of a sudden you start to go, man, what's going to happen next?
[140:34.20]Paul Giamatti.
[140:35.04]Oh, what a performance, by the way.
[140:37.44]If you haven't seen the John Adams HBO miniseries, Paul Giamatti is an amazing John Adams.
[140:44.67]Wonderful, wonderful, wonderful performance.
[140:57.75]George Washington.
[140:58.55]Who plays George Washington in that show?
[141:00.49]He does a great job too.
[141:01.87]Every single, um, I almost said character.
[141:04.94]Every character is good.
[141:06.68]Well, it is, well, every depiction of a historical figure is good.
[141:11.82]There you go.
[141:18.35]My dad is obsessed with John Adams and he hates that miniseries.
[141:21.81]Oh no.
[141:25.63]What, is it just riddled with inaccuracies?
[141:27.37]Is that the problem?
[141:38.28]I gotta lock in here because I have to have at least one... One time where the believers actually get paid out.
[141:49.66]Because we're working on a 99% destruction of their wealth here when it comes to channel points.
[142:02.86]Believers are probably totally broke right now.
[142:06.24]They never get a chance to win.
[142:08.41]And I'm going to make sure they do right now.
[142:09.61]I'm going to be quiet.
[142:10.29]Here we go.
[142:16.77]Sometimes you just lock in and the believers get a fucking payout.
[142:19.21]A big one.
[142:26.29]I just had to lock in.
[142:27.03]That's it.
[142:27.31]People are going to be pretty mad about that one.
[142:39.51]It was the one right after it too.
[142:45.31]No, let's do three more.
[142:47.85]Yeah.
[142:48.61]Let's see it one more time.
[142:49.51]2,500 attempts.
[143:00.52]So you got to hit it right there, right?
[143:03.87]Like there, it looks like for those of you that are playing, where does it hit on this pot here?
[143:10.71]Right on the left side, right there.
[143:15.42]Wow.
[143:17.14]9.7 million channel points are going out to only 635 people.
[143:22.60]Holy shit.
[143:30.11]Some of you just made millions.
[143:32.25]Okay, cool.
[143:35.11]Well, I did it.
[143:39.17]For a second, I was wondering why the game's music was like this.
[143:43.43]And I was like, oh, wait, I have that in an OST.
[143:45.07]Oh, never mind.
[143:48.09]Okay, whatever this is.
[143:49.01]Oh, yeah, this one seems fun.
[143:52.72]Um... Cup flip thing, or...
[143:58.49]Slide marble around a track.
[144:01.96]Which one do you think?
[144:05.90]Is this song just playing on loop?
[144:09.60]Yeah, this has been... This song's been going for 16 minutes.
[144:13.52]How about... What is this?
[144:22.71]The NES Pictionary soundtrack.
[144:24.79]That just popped up in the recommended.
[144:26.25]I'm curious about it.
[144:31.68]Okay.
[144:34.30]I just clicked an ad.
[144:36.60]Oops.
[144:43.21]Ooh.
[144:45.57]What is this?
[144:46.33]This is awesome.
[144:47.41]Damn, okay.
[144:53.04]Okay.
[144:57.00]I don't want to be too loud.
[144:58.48]We'll do the marbles.
[145:01.26]This is Pictionary.
[145:04.77]So you've got to throw it and it's got to curve around the whole thing and then go into the cup.
[145:16.21]Sensitivity maybe?
[145:17.27]No, I mean, let's see.
[145:21.45]Oh my god, I almost had it.
[145:35.93]Um, excuse me?
[145:36.91]That was literally two minutes.
[145:38.53]Bingo.
[145:40.29]You don't even have a chance to bet.
[145:44.40]I had that one on lockdown right for the moment I came in here.
[145:48.48]I almost did it second attempt.
[145:56.51]I'm so happy right now.
[145:57.97]I thought it was going to take me all stream to even do one or two of these.
[146:04.63]Okay.
[146:04.95]Well, that was cool.
[146:06.53]110 attempts total.
[146:08.33]Two minutes.
[146:12.09]Two minutes is crazy.
[146:13.15]Okay.
[146:17.11]This one's going to be hard.
[146:23.25]You got to throw a plastic cup into a coffee cup that has a plastic cup in it.
[146:29.14]And it has to go in that way.
[146:31.24]All right.
[146:31.44]What is this?
[146:33.14]Oh, it's telling me to like
[146:36.15]Oh, okay.
[146:48.59]Shit.
[146:49.37]Oh, this one's gonna be addicting.
[147:06.93]A little too much.
[147:11.29]Sensitivity, maybe.
[147:12.55]Yeah, I think sensitivity is going to change here.
[147:21.51]If it bounces off that and goes in, it counts, right?
[147:31.00]Honey, where are all the solo cups?
[147:38.62]I stole that from chat.
[147:45.54]If you pile enough of them up, can't you just get it to fall in?
[147:47.80]Now something tells me if you get it in like this, the TikTok is not that impressive.
[148:00.83]If you see all this shit everywhere, it's like, oh wow, it took you like 10,000 tries, man.
[148:06.55]That's not impressive, right?
[148:11.46]So you have to go like this.
[148:15.22]And then somebody picks that up and throws it back.
[148:31.13]right there right there right there right there don't move right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right the right the right the right the right the right the right the right the right the right the right the right the right the right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there right there
[149:18.17]Wait, can I move it in the air?
[149:32.41]Ugh.
[149:34.69]Stack the cups up like a mountain?
[149:43.17]One of these will go in.
[149:43.92]Just needs to flip the right way.
[150:01.30]Old NES games, some of those composers just went absolutely cracked out with these songs.
[150:17.60]Actually might be a little bit too low.
[150:31.51]Shit Oof Does that mean anything?
[150:43.32]Do I get anything for that?
[150:44.13]I feel like that should count
[150:59.30]My god that should count it's in there Can I bump it in there I can knock it in right Shit
[151:32.44]I don't want to delete them, but I kind of, it's kind of hard to see now.
[151:50.69]Get in there.
[151:54.17]Come on, get in there.
[152:10.19]I don't know.
[152:11.09]It's a dog.
[152:11.91]It's a cat.
[152:13.75]It's a lion.
[152:14.41]I don't know.
[152:14.87]Playing Pictionary would be crazy to this.
[152:35.30]Clear it.
[152:50.13]That was close.
[152:59.27]Once you get in the rhythm, one of them will eventually just go in.
[153:02.36]Just got to get the rhythm.
[153:14.46]A little bit higher.
[153:18.00]Are you capable of love?
[153:19.16]You seem heartless.
[153:22.18]What gave you that idea?
[153:23.20]What the fuck are you talking about?
[153:38.71]Damn it.
[153:43.06]Well, they're bouncing.
[153:43.94]I think I got the right sensitivity though.
[153:57.99]Oh, you son of a gun!
[154:22.54]Watch that language.
[154:23.86]Yep, yep, I know.
[154:35.81]The speed is there.
[154:36.87]The distance is there.
[154:38.01]I'm just not flipping the right way.
[154:40.65]I'm going to slow my wrist down.
[155:00.46]Too slow.
[155:08.15]You have to spin it, bro?
[155:09.23]What do you mean, spin it?
[155:34.61]Like the mouse tutorial.
[155:35.59]Yeah, but it's not really doing anything, is it?
[155:39.67]The tutorial said up and then left.
[155:43.51]But doing that, you just kind of whip it.
[155:49.38]How am I dealing with balding?
[156:05.36]I still got hair.
[156:07.93]Hey, I made it to 40 with a full head of hair.
[156:11.19]I don't care anymore.
[156:13.08]Like, I don't care.
[156:15.08]You make it to 40 with a full head.
[156:18.08]That's okay with me.
[156:19.00]I'm good.
[156:19.48]I had 40 years of hair.
[156:25.60]And it looked damn good too, okay?
[156:27.54]It looked damn good for 40 years.
[156:36.90]Come on, get in there.
[156:51.05]That was almost it.
[157:14.07]That's so hard to try to spin it.
[157:31.95]They don't flip in the tutorial.
[157:35.61]So how do you get it to stay up like that?
[157:37.50]Oh, hold on.
[157:50.52]Sensitivity is too high then.
[157:51.46]How do you feel about snot rockets?
[158:11.24]That's gross.
[158:14.56]Fuck.
[158:19.93]All right, I gotta lock in.
[159:00.38]Dude, the spinning thing, I don't get it.
[159:02.44]I'm going up and then left and flicking it.
[159:08.57]Unless I'm doing it and I just don't know I'm doing it.
[159:17.91]Oh, we lost our OST.
[159:25.11]That's another good one.
[159:38.50]Tutorial again.
[159:39.24]That's true.
[159:44.10]Hmm.
[159:46.91]Mario Sunshine.
[159:48.51]No, we got to jump to some new stuff here.
[159:55.01]Age of Mythology is a good one.
[160:22.86]Ooh.
[160:26.57]Very good.
[160:27.13]Okay.
[160:29.15]First try.
[160:29.57]One, two, three.
[160:38.59]I want to watch the tutorial again.
[160:43.54]OK, so if you throw it.
[160:47.25]And it's it doesn't fall.
[160:49.13]Doesn't get bored.
[160:52.43]Hold the mouse button down and that's what I'm doing.
[160:58.76]I'm going like up left.
[161:01.28]Up left up left.
[161:07.68]I'm trying to get the some spin on it.
[161:09.54]It's not really happening though.
[161:23.33]whoa okay hold on a second you have to like you have to whip it this is gonna be a huge pain in the ass
[162:01.76]sensitivity is a little too high.
[162:17.40]This is like a workout.
[162:31.28]Even when I whip it, it doesn't... Sometimes it doesn't do it all the way.
[162:37.62]This one is way harder than it let on.
[163:00.79]Yeah, you gotta like bounce it.
[163:02.33]You gotta snap it.
[163:03.69]You gotta get that snap finish.
[163:05.75]Did you see the snap finish?
[163:10.98]You actually have to do a snap finish.
[163:31.20]Can't seem to get the spin and the momentum at the same time.
[163:53.03]This one sucks.
[163:59.93]You don't have, you have any idea how many snap finishes I'm doing right now?
[164:03.72]Too many.
[164:15.14]Something's wrong.
[164:15.88]It needs to be actually, probably let's do that.
[164:23.12]So there's a lot less movement of the arm.
[164:25.51]That actually helps a lot.
[164:28.21]It's a crazy sensitivity, but I think actually it's going to work out.
[164:32.13]Check this out.
[164:32.89]All the non-believers, you're in fucking trouble now.
[164:57.77]It's too high.
[165:08.26]Shit!
[165:10.10]Uh-oh.
[165:20.39]Come on, man.
[165:24.16]Yeah, it's okay.
[165:24.62]This one's really hard because to throw the cup, you click and hold and you click and hold and throw, right?
[165:37.13]You click, hold, move your mouse up to throw.
[165:39.53]But I also have to rip my hand to the left.
[165:41.29]But if I rip my hand to the left, I'm going to throw it to the left.
[165:48.19]I feel like using an actual cup in real life would be easier.
[166:07.18]Shit.
[166:13.58]That was perfect if it had stayed upright.
[166:41.37]It's too short.
[166:42.27]This Goldilocks bullshit.
[166:43.65]It's either too short or too long.
[166:52.04]These things curve in the air too.
[166:53.66]I'm not doing that.
[167:02.06]Fuck you game.
[167:02.86]Hold on.
[167:19.47]getting it all the way up there too is like each one of these games has a very very different kind of physics system oh really now you just now you're just messing with me
[167:47.92]Now you're just messing with me.
[168:08.22]How could it possibly be way too hard or way too soft?
[168:11.46]I'm doing the same shit every throw.
[168:25.58]I'm going to bail on this one.
[168:37.99]Oh, that was it.
[168:42.11]That was it.
[168:42.77]Come on.
[168:43.13]I feel like I need a bigger mouse pad.
[169:25.77]Clean this fucking room up.
[169:30.71]Oh, come on.
[169:31.33]That was... I'm getting closer.
[169:32.53]I'm not leaving.
[169:33.63]I'm actually seeing some real improvement here.
[169:53.40]Shit.
[169:58.88]Oh, that was perfect.
[169:59.88]Just a little too hard.
[170:07.85]But OST, this is Age of Mythology.
[170:22.70]I lost it again.
[170:37.01]It is so hard to throw it at the end of the throw to throw it to the left.
[170:42.43]To get it to spin.
[170:47.60]And keep the same amount of momentum going forward.
[171:06.13]Gotta get that perfect sensitivity with the amount of pressure that I'm doing to the mouse.
[171:26.43]Fuck!
[171:48.03]Come on, dude.
[171:48.81]I'm losing it.
[171:53.53]I love my arm is just getting tired.
[171:59.96]That was so perfect.
[172:01.12]It just went a little further.
[172:19.49]so close though get rid of it this chat is something else hey why don't you guys hey why don't you guys relax a little okay you're scaring away any of the new viewers that are here hey why don't you hey dial it back a little okay put on a mouse cam no
[172:49.27]Hey, back off.
[172:51.37]Yeah, hey, back off is right.
[172:58.75]What's going to pretend that these are part of the music?
[173:00.61]It's the funniest movie of the year.
[173:25.70]I lost it.
[173:27.98]I can't get it back.
[173:36.28]It's too... 31 minutes?
[173:52.57]just did the same movement two times how did it go like into the ceiling on the second one
[174:23.80]Some of those were pretty close.
[174:41.68]Now it takes way too much to do it.
[174:51.92]Fuck you.
[174:52.66]That was so good.
[174:53.48]It was just, it didn't have any spin.
[175:20.03]I can't do it.
[175:20.51]I give up.
[175:23.16]I give up.
[175:24.48]This one hurts my head too much.
[175:25.64]This one's too hard to do with my hand.
[175:39.96]To get it to spin like that, how the fuck are you supposed to do that?
[176:19.20]85% believe, by the way.
[176:20.38]Oh, God.
[176:21.06]In how much time?
[176:22.84]I don't even know what the bet was.
[176:59.20]Fuck, that was so close.
[177:43.97]This one's dumb.
[178:19.85]This one's dumb.
[178:20.39]I wouldn't do this for the video.
[178:36.64]How come you said that like you were clucking like a chicken?
[178:38.70]Wait, what?
[178:38.90]What do you mean?
[178:59.60]I'm so close but so unbelievably far away at the same time.
[179:34.23]you all right now I'm getting mad it's so hard to get the spin on it I can get the spin on it but look at it just like it's the funniest movie of the year
[180:10.04]I'll take a break and I'll come back to it.
[180:11.93]You're right.
[180:12.79]Somebody said to come back to it.
[180:16.81]But there's so many people.
[180:18.26]I have to get this right now.
[180:42.84]All right, I'll get up.
[180:43.62]I'm going to get up.
[180:44.24]I'll get up.
[180:44.66]I'll get up.
[180:45.08]I'll get up.
[180:45.40]I got to get up anyways.
[180:50.60]And then I'm coming back and I'm going to land it first try.
[180:54.37]How much time is on the clock?
[180:57.55]39 minutes.
[181:00.05]I hope everyone didn't go all in on this one.
[181:04.83]Honestly, it was better when I had it all the way.
[181:44.60]Also, it's hard to like to know.
[181:46.24]I wish I had a little arrow on the screen showing me like where I was actually aiming.
[181:51.38]Although that would be probably make this 1000 times easier.
[181:54.37]It's hard.
[181:55.01]It's hard to even know where the like because I have my mouse pad, right?
[181:59.45]But.
[182:02.19]Where is starting at zero?
[182:03.97]It's hard to even know.
[182:07.25]Whoa, oh my God, I did it.
[182:09.71]Holy shit.
[182:10.55]OK, believers win again.
[182:16.78]Damn, OK.
[182:17.62]40 minutes.
[182:22.52]So hold on, how did I?
[182:29.59]Just it caught the edge.
[182:31.27]It just barely caught the edge.
[182:33.93]That was so lucky I would have been there for another hour at least.
[182:36.57]Do you see how it like popped right on the edge?
[182:40.19]That was not perfect.
[182:45.13]That didn't just slide in there.
[182:47.15]That was a bouncer.
[182:50.73]Shit.
[182:51.01]Okay.
[182:52.79]I didn't think I was going to do this one.
[182:56.47]41 minutes.
[182:58.59]Very nice.
[182:58.99]All right.
[182:59.31]I'm going to pee.
[183:00.85]And it's been an hour.
[183:05.03]Stretch a little.
[183:08.35]How you doing, dog?
[183:09.13]You need something?
[183:11.27]Yeah.
[183:13.05]Alright, I'll be back.
[183:13.97]Give me like another few minutes.
[183:16.15]Get up and stretch around.
[183:18.14]I'm blowing through these.
[183:19.22]I'm doing much better than I thought.
[183:24.64]See you guys in a few minutes.
[186:53.27]Thank you for watching!
[187:34.60]OK, I'm back.
[187:39.18]Other few seconds.
[187:46.28]Alrighty, let's go.
[187:49.73]I'm surprised I got that one.
[187:55.71]Let's see, what do I got?
[187:56.69]I got I did this one.
[187:58.43]All the card one.
[187:59.31]I could try this one again.
[188:08.02]I don't think I want to do this one.
[188:10.74]I could definitely do these two.
[188:13.16]But what else we got?
[188:17.12]This is three in a row.
[188:18.70]Oh, okay.
[188:19.30]This is the one.
[188:20.82]Yeah, this is the one that I saw Northern Lion do.
[188:25.38]Uh-huh.
[188:29.66]Okay.
[188:31.00]Well, I don't know if I'm going to be able to do this one.
[188:40.02]You have to get it 1, 2, 3.
[188:41.08]Oh shit, so you have to reset it.
[188:51.89]This is way too high.
[188:53.05]I need to carve it a little.
[189:03.55]Oh my god, that's still too high.
[189:11.98]I'm worried about one.
[189:13.00]I have to practice.
[189:26.94]I think we got to go very low sensitivity.
[189:39.90]Even just getting the three, holy shit, this is going to be impossible.
[189:55.21]I'm worried about your two and three.
[189:58.38]Well, don't, well, let me worry about that.
[190:00.40]You worry about making a nice peppermint tea for yourself.
[190:28.52]Okay, here's the problem.
[190:31.26]I took Northern Lion 17 hours to do this one.
[190:36.04]And let me just judge by... I mean, he's like 140 IQ, right?
[190:39.49]I don't have... So it's going to take me like 30 to 40 hours to do this.
[190:44.45]My IQ is fine.
[190:44.75]My IQ is like 120. 120.
[190:57.81]115 or something.
[190:59.59]That's pretty high.
[191:06.59]No, we did, yeah, it's 98.5.
[191:08.99]That's the, that's the joke.
[191:10.85]That's the joke from a, guys, hey, I've got news for you.
[191:14.53]If you take an IQ test and it's 15 minutes, if it's less than like 30 minutes and it's from some random website, that's not in a, no, that's not, that's not accurate.
[191:26.96]And whatever, a 100 IQ is pretty fucking good.
[191:35.44]Yeah, whatever.
[191:36.90]That's fine.
[191:38.22]My regular IQ can be 90.
[191:40.06]That's fine.
[191:41.48]My inquisitive IQ is probably like 5,000.
[191:49.71]Don't believe me?
[191:52.15]Don't believe me?
[192:15.26]Yeah, okay.
[192:18.09]Uh, where are these ads coming from?
[192:20.57]Relevant ads popping up that were definitely filmed in the last year or two.
[192:25.47]Watching a clip about sweeteners.
[192:28.19]There's a fully produced Aspartame is safe ad.
[192:32.43]I have never seen this ad in my entire life.
[192:35.67]Why now?
[192:37.15]Why does it exist now?
[192:39.06]Why are fully produced ads available right when you seem to search for something?
[192:43.82]Ad space is expensive.
[192:46.14]You have a specific ad for when specific keywords are explored on YouTube?
[192:50.12]How many people are reliably seeing this ad in this exact weird... In this exact weird must play out exactly like this scenario?
[193:03.93]Do you just permanently buy ad space?
[193:06.07]Do you do it for a season?
[193:09.27]He's reading from his insane notes.
[193:14.48]Oh yeah, how about this one?
[193:15.70]Real men wear suspenders and have hair that looks like it smells.
[193:19.37]Okay?
[193:20.93]Don't tell me I don't have an inquisitive IQ.
[193:26.70]The spinning UFO ride and even rides in general, why do we do this?
[193:30.52]There are some rides like that that have nothing good about them.
[193:34.46]You are just trapped and miserable.
[193:37.20]What is the purpose?
[193:39.10]Is it like a horror movie for your body?
[193:42.26]I don't think our bodies want to watch a horror movie.
[193:45.20]Your brain is a real asshole fucking with your non-sentient stomach and heart with pranks like this.
[194:00.46]No, I'll do one more.
[194:01.14]Uh, I keep editing Discord messages and look like I'm changing the narrative.
[194:07.06]I promise I just misspelled four words and don't want to look uneducated.
[194:12.65]That was a banger tweet that I never sent.
[194:18.31]That was such a good tweet.
[194:20.01]That would have done like a million impressions.
[194:29.07]Wait, what?
[194:29.59]Oh.
[194:36.73]You want another one?
[194:38.25]I've got like, guys, I have a book, I have like a notepad that I've written down hundreds of, do you want another one?
[194:45.16]Fine, one more.
[194:46.70]Somebody just called me Brian Griffin.
[194:53.86]All these TV slash movie high school lockers are not what I experienced.
[194:58.82]It was a trash heap.
[195:00.97]Months of old papers.
[195:02.89]Dump.
[195:04.07]You couldn't see the bottom of the locker and it was potentially disgusting to put your hand in there.
[195:18.45]I'll do one more.
[195:21.51]While watching late night talk show TV, I said, hey honey, can you change the channel?
[195:26.33]It feels like there's an anvil on my brain because it's bad and I hated it so much.
[195:31.01]Okay, that one's not really funny.
[195:32.14]That's just me writing something.
[195:36.06]All right.
[195:37.22]This one in particular, this one, people gave me shit for this one and I'm going to just, I'm going to say it again.
[195:42.68]This is the ultimate Redditor test.
[195:46.02]Do you know about the Christopher Lee backstab video?
[195:55.84]If you know, if you know that video, then you are a Redditor.
[196:02.60]The one where he's, no, what happens is it goes, if you've seen that video, you're a Redditor and you can pretend all you want.
[196:30.11]A lot of these are fucking weird.
[196:32.16]And maybe I'll go over them one day.
[196:37.00]Did I talk about how streamers are turning into the new bar?
[196:41.24]Like meeting people, community, regulars, having a favorite bar.
[196:45.13]Different vibes for different streamers.
[196:47.29]Like an Irish pub versus a club versus a dive.
[196:52.93]It's not location anymore.
[196:54.05]It's potentially a person or a place on the internet.
[196:59.25]So this is like a bar.
[197:08.61]Did I say this one?
[197:09.44]I definitely did.
[197:11.32]Love when the band starts playing something obscure like Inspector Gadget for five seconds before returning to the real song.
[197:17.60]They did that for me.
[197:18.92]I'm the guy in the audience that even knows what that is.
[197:31.95]I'll read the rest later.
[197:41.90]Not like the other audience members.
[197:46.48]Holy shit, it's got two and then three.
[197:48.01]Going to three is going to go down there.
[197:50.29]I sound like a chicken.
[197:52.81]Yeah, I do.
[197:54.17]Fuck.
[197:55.17]What do I do about that?
[197:58.29]What do I do about that?
[198:07.12]Are you ever going to show the Hulk video or the Dark Souls clip?
[198:11.50]Dude, I got the best Bloodborne clip ever recorded.
[198:16.85]And I'll show it one day.
[198:27.03]You gotta curve these.
[198:28.15]Okay, hold on a second.
[198:34.65]You gotta gently...
[198:40.83]Alright, I think I'm getting it.
[199:04.02]I'll go back to that one later.
[199:12.86]Hey, I'm gonna break some news to you, dude.
[199:14.18]That's never happening.
[199:17.22]I thought that about the cups.
[199:18.65]But I do kind of agree with you.
[199:22.29]By the way, if anybody steals any of those fucking things that I said, you make a movie about it.
[199:27.15]I want 30% this time.
[199:31.91]If I see any of you motherfuckers on a stage somewhere, like, let me tell you something.
[199:35.90]Rides are pranking your butt.
[199:37.42]If I see that, dude, I want fucking 40% of your entire routine.
[199:57.50]So you got to wait.
[199:58.71]This is a two.
[200:02.59]Copyright Andy.
[200:10.10]Holy shit.
[200:10.74]This is this is piecing together multiple.
[200:13.94]I got to get this one done first.
[200:16.12]We're going for two now.
[200:18.79]This I don't understand this one.
[200:20.33]Somebody help me explain this one to me.
[200:27.61]So it has to land cap side down on the die.
[200:35.40]So it wants you to push it forward and then pull it back.
[200:43.90]I can't even get it to go forward.
[200:46.52]Forward.
[200:48.46]Forward.
[200:48.96]Why is it not going forward?
[200:49.74]Throw.
[200:54.13]I can't even throw it.
[200:59.05]Uh, what's going on?
[201:09.46]Long forward, short back.
[201:10.88]I feel like that's what I'm doing.
[201:13.64]I'm going like... What?
[201:33.60]OK, hold on.
[201:46.68]I don't even know how this would ever be done in real life.
[201:54.38]This actually feels impossible.
[202:10.81]Probably easier in real life.
[202:20.20]Holy shit, that was close.
[202:21.90]Damn.
[202:26.80]That would have been awesome if I got it right there.
[202:35.47]This one seems like one of the harder ones.
[202:43.31]What would you name your... What would you name your son, daughter?
[202:46.55]Ivan.
[202:50.99]Ivan.
[202:56.60]I'm taking that.
[202:57.22]Don't take that.
[202:58.70]Don't make that a popular name now.
[203:01.14]No.
[203:02.52]No, I want 30%.
[203:07.58]Whatever that kid does, whatever he grows up to be, if he becomes a fucking big scientist or something and has a bunch of money, I want 30% of it.
[203:23.46]Well, Isaac.
[203:24.76]I like Isaac too.
[203:30.12]Isaac and Ivan.
[203:31.66]I like them both.
[203:53.78]Uh, let me think.
[203:54.91]I like, um, like Stephanie.
[203:56.29]I think Stephanie's a nice name.
[203:58.84]I think.
[204:03.89]Um.
[204:33.28]No, not Jeremy.
[204:35.48]No, I don't know.
[204:38.02]You hear somebody yell Jeremy in the house and it's like, huh?
[204:40.19]What?
[204:41.23]Oh, no.
[204:42.29]Which one?
[204:42.65]Who are you looking for?
[204:56.97]Jeremy Jr.
[204:57.67]No, no.
[205:19.47]Uh, what about Jen?
[205:20.26]Yeah, I like Jen.
[205:21.08]Jen's a nice name.
[205:31.19]I like, um, I like Lucy.
[205:32.81]I think Lucy's a nice name.
[205:36.71]The seal.
[205:37.03]The seal.
[206:00.61]I feel like this one was not going to happen, but I kind of believe it will now that I almost did it twice.
[206:12.44]What about Julia?
[206:13.06]Julia's a nice name too.
[206:13.74]I like Julia.
[206:23.16]What about Bob?
[206:24.88]Bob's good.
[206:28.06]I feel like I've said Bob so many times, though, as me referencing a made up person that I'm making a joke about.
[206:34.27]And I don't know if I could be like, oh, hey, Bob.
[206:36.47]Oh, so this guy, Bob.
[206:38.01]Oh, wait, that's you.
[206:40.01]You're a real person here now.
[206:48.73]Robert's a nice name, though.
[207:10.75]Whoa, did you see that?
[207:11.51]There was no spin on that at all.
[207:14.38]It's like a knuckleball.
[207:27.54]Shit, OK, all right.
[207:30.24]Ah.
[207:35.52]California is a nice girl's name.
[207:38.39]California.
[207:41.02]States for names.
[207:48.37]Hey, meet... All right, come here, son.
[207:51.45]Kansas Elbertson.
[208:07.11]How about Benjamin Franklin Elbertson?
[208:14.19]No, you can't do that.
[208:15.55]You can't do that.
[208:16.87]That kid's life will be a fucking living hell.
[208:30.63]Shit.
[208:39.40]Virginia, Virginia.
[208:40.38]Yeah, that's that's true.
[208:41.28]No October strong.
[208:56.35]Need something else.
[208:59.21]He's kind of just looking at me.
[209:00.23]He's just like, what are you doing?
[209:07.43]I want this one so bad because I did almost get it like three times.
[209:10.42]I kind of want to move the dice again.
[209:32.63]Come on.
[209:32.97]All right, 10 more tries on this one.
[209:51.50]Somebody said put a hand cam on.
[209:54.24]Nah, we don't need a cam.
[209:56.38]I've gone pretty much camless the last four or five times I've streamed.
[210:01.90]Back in the old days.
[210:10.84]Shit.
[210:16.72]How do I get it to do that?
[210:19.26]The no movement at all.
[210:32.31]costco starting no you can like oh here it is walmart albertson well I mean isn't it it's the what the walton family or something that's why it's walmart technically a family's last name I guess
[211:07.32]Damn it.
[211:20.43]There, I might just make like a wow character.
[211:24.01]This is what is this?
[211:25.33]See, I got you here.
[211:26.93]I got you here with this fun.
[211:29.49]Let's fucking go with this.
[211:31.80]This simulator with trickshot.
[211:33.82]I got you here.
[211:35.18]And now I'm going to move to World of Warcraft.
[211:39.52]No, I'm not.
[211:39.86]I'm kidding.
[211:50.09]That would be for a different day.
[211:52.59]You guys think I'm messing around.
[211:53.59]I'm just going to be blasting music.
[211:55.96]I'm not even going to talk.
[211:59.72]That may as well be a pre-recorded stream.
[212:03.97]I might talk sometimes.
[212:14.66]Prepare for double digit viewers.
[212:16.70]All right.
[212:16.94]Do you mean double digit as in like double digit two as in like five digits, like 20,000?
[212:27.34]Or do you mean two?
[212:29.26]You mean like less than nine?
[212:31.60]You mean less than 99 people or less than a hundred people?
[212:33.89]That would be funny actually.
[212:46.30]35 viewers whatever hey I'd be playing world of warcraft I'd be happy what's the matter what do you need I think he wants to go outside
[213:12.26]I feel like he went outside like only a few hours ago.
[213:14.50]Do you need to pee again?
[213:16.08]Is that what it is?
[213:16.78]Do you have a little bladder?
[213:29.79]Let me see what he needs.
[213:30.85]I think he needs something.
[213:32.50]He did eat already.
[213:33.24]I'm not going to run ads.
[213:36.60]I'm just going to go BRB for one minute.
[213:42.84]I'll be right back.
[213:45.20]Less than two minutes.
[214:13.71]Thank you.
[220:06.87]Okay, sorry about that.
[220:09.55]Otto needed to use the bathroom.
[220:12.72]He needed to do a dog poop.
[220:18.60]He's good.
[220:28.09]Okay.
[220:31.39]I'm done with this one.
[220:35.24]I want to get... I feel like after playing for this long and doing six of them already, I can get this one for sure.
[220:43.73]Got to get stuck in the middle.
[220:53.01]Just announcing his business like that.
[220:58.52]Way too high.
[221:04.46]So these curve to the left.
[221:11.37]Still a little too high.
[221:17.61]What is this one like little bursts, little short bursts?
[221:25.83]Wait, what's the tutorial say?
[221:35.71]What did you learn to swear?
[221:37.05]I don't know.
[221:42.73]Kids in school.
[221:47.03]Somebody said, shit.
[221:48.71]I was like, what's that?
[221:50.56]I don't know.
[221:54.32]What did anybody learn to do that?
[222:01.68]And I didn't even watch the tutorial because I was busy talking.
[222:04.10]Hold on.
[222:12.09]So you want this to be flat.
[222:15.05]They don't tell you how to do it.
[222:15.97]Dude, this one is screwed up.
[222:25.29]Hmm.
[222:38.14]Less sensitivity.
[222:43.45]and then just send it?
[222:46.27]Not really.
[222:46.69]They're not even reaching.
[223:20.85]Favorite of the four elements?
[223:22.31]I don't know.
[223:26.10]I like them all.
[223:28.72]I wanted to say air.
[223:31.26]Then I wanted to say water.
[223:32.24]And then I wanted to say fire.
[223:33.61]Definitely not wood.
[223:39.09]But that's not even true.
[223:40.41]Earth is cool too.
[223:42.25]Earth might even be the coolest one.
[223:56.14]Soup or stew?
[223:57.70]It depends.
[224:00.18]The knee-jerk reaction is stew.
[224:03.69]Only because I just imagined a really good beef stew.
[224:10.21]But then I immediately thought of soup.
[224:12.79]I thought of a really good minestrone.
[224:16.38]They're both pretty much the same thing anyways.
[224:17.94]Sensitivity needs to change.
[224:28.16]I won't be live for very much longer.
[224:29.32]Maybe another, like, 15, 20 minutes or so.
[224:39.57]But... I will be live this weekend.
[224:45.81]Probably multiple times.
[224:56.91]I don't know.
[224:57.17]I might even go live tomorrow.
[224:59.35]I might actually do an Omega Gaming weekend.
[225:01.65]It's possible.
[225:10.30]Will there be a Horsepin stream?
[225:11.40]I don't know about that.
[225:16.58]We were talking about stuff earlier.
[225:18.88]But I think that would likely be early next week.
[225:23.22]I don't think that'll be this weekend.
[225:24.50]Although I could be wrong.
[225:25.96]Never know.
[225:27.87]I am not understanding this one, like, at all.
[225:33.12]This is my full-time retired streamer.
[225:42.02]No, we blew the channel up.
[225:45.38]And now I'm just going to start... I'm starting at zero again.
[225:49.34]That almost went in.
[225:54.80]I like exactly where I am right now.
[225:57.10]It's perfect.
[226:13.45]You say that, but there are 13,000 people here.
[226:20.09]Well, I mean...
[226:23.01]I can't really control who does or doesn't come to a stream, right?
[226:28.15]All I can do is do what, you know, makes me comfortable and happy, right?
[226:35.22]Well, think about it.
[226:36.94]Think about it.
[226:38.16]Now that I've been, I just don't, there's not really a whole lot of expectations anymore because I did set them.
[226:43.54]Let's be very honest.
[226:49.13]There's no Discord anymore.
[226:51.73]Off hours.
[226:52.95]That was, you know, tons of shit going on in there all the time.
[227:01.36]And the expectations that I'm setting are, you know, just whatever.
[227:05.60]I might play World of Warcraft with no mic.
[227:10.72]I might throw cards at a wall for three and a half to four hours.
[227:13.26]I don't know.
[227:16.05]But I'm good.
[227:18.16]I like exactly where I am right now.
[227:27.17]We're going back to the basics.
[227:36.01]And that could mean three or four streams in a row.
[227:37.86]That might be two or three streams in a month.
[227:41.28]It might be a stream every day for 24 hours.
[227:44.34]That's never going to happen.
[227:45.58]I can assure you.
[227:52.54]The one thing I can guarantee you in this kind of... whatever you want to call it... There'll never be another stream that's more than seven or eight hours ever again.
[228:04.27]I know I've said that before, but I'm just going to repeat it a few more times.
[228:13.46]I cannot get this one to do what I want it to do.
[228:19.38]I'm going to do low sensitivity and I'm going to really throw it kind of like a line drive.
[228:28.46]Not really.
[228:28.86]What about Kingdom Come Deliverance?
[228:41.26]I actually have it.
[228:42.52]I did want to play it.
[228:45.75]I watched Italics play the first little part of it and I joined his stream and he was not enjoying it.
[228:53.89]I think he was saying that the intro is just like so long.
[228:58.47]It's like four hours or something.
[229:02.71]I think he said if you do want to stream it or play it, he's like just do the tutorial kind of off stream because it's like three hours of like a movie effectively.
[229:14.33]That's close.
[229:36.54]I heard you were blue.
[229:37.48]Um, I'm doing all right.
[229:46.70]I just got it.
[229:47.18]I got it.
[229:47.68]I got it.
[229:48.14]I did it.
[229:48.48]Holy shit.
[229:48.86]I was looking at chat.
[229:50.22]I was literally looking at the other monitor and I just got it.
[229:55.37]What happened?
[229:55.93]I was just, I, okay.
[229:57.43]I wasn't even paying attention.
[230:02.71]Okay.
[230:02.99]That doesn't count, but it does.
[230:09.05]Uh, okay.
[230:10.61]I'll take it.
[230:11.15]Hey, that's a win.
[230:12.43]That is a victory.
[230:16.00]Yeah, no wonder that was... Okay, I threw that and looked at chat.
[230:21.34]And in my mind, it was so off that there was no way... Like, ready?
[230:25.28]Look at the chat now.
[230:27.64]No, it was that one, I mean.
[230:29.30]The one that actually went in.
[230:30.34]I threw it and then looked over at chat because I was like, there's no fucking way it's impossible.
[230:33.72]That is not going to go in there.
[230:37.07]This one.
[230:37.33]I don't even remember.
[230:38.63]Whatever.
[230:39.19]I win.
[230:41.49]What the fuck is going on?
[230:45.73]What was that?
[230:46.47]That was an ad?
[230:46.99]I don't even know what that was an ad for.
[230:48.29]I just heard somebody talking.
[230:55.51]It was a T-Mobile ad?
[230:56.99]Alright, I think that's a good one to go out on, actually.
[231:04.64]I don't know if I'm going to get better than that.
[231:06.02]The luck has run out, I think, after this one.
[231:09.50]That's such horse shit.
[231:10.48]I love it.
[231:11.61]Okay.
[231:11.91]Well, all right.
[231:12.41]What do I do?
[231:14.01]One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight.
[231:21.29]I did eight of these.
[231:22.15]I would have been happy if I did one or two of them.
[231:27.05]This coat hanger one is so much fun, though.
[231:28.83]This is the best one so far.
[231:30.05]It absolutely is the best one.
[231:39.64]I could just do this just for fun, just hanging out.
[231:44.88]And see, and I am, that is a 49 second personal best.
[231:53.23]Now we actually have to end the stream because there's no way I'm going to do better than this.
[232:01.97]49 seconds.
[232:02.67]That's it.
[232:05.83]Okay.
[232:06.25]Well, I'll take that.
[232:11.98]Well, this is a fun game.
[232:13.32]Um... Will I play it again?
[232:15.24]I think I've done the ones that I'm probably capable of doing besides... Hmm, there's probably... Eh, I don't know.
[232:25.03]There's probably a few of these I could do.
[232:26.31]Just to show you how ridiculous some of these actually get.
[232:28.71]Let's look at this one.
[232:29.35]This one's crazy.
[232:30.15]Look at how fucked up this one is.
[232:31.35]You're gonna bounce the ball.
[232:35.55]And then throw the dart through the ball and get a bullseye.
[232:40.32]Like, what the hell are they talking about?
[232:43.56]And you only get one throw each.
[232:45.88]You have to reset every time.
[232:52.71]Do you want to talk about getting locked in?
[232:53.93]There's no way I'm doing this one.
[232:58.43]And you got to throw.
[233:01.55]And you have to hit space to switch between them.
[233:06.62]you got to get that yeah and the thing is light it is a light floaty dart oh you know what I want to play that um I want to play that motortown game this one's crazy too this is like a whole rube goldberg machine off the pan into the bucket
[233:30.70]Then you have to throw a card and hit the dinosaur.
[233:34.24]Throw another card and hit the clothespin.
[233:37.26]And then this comes down and then goes in here.
[233:41.56]I just don't even understand.
[233:46.58]And it's another one of these where you only get to throw it once before you have to reset.
[233:55.57]Yeah, Northern Lion spent 17 hours.
[233:57.63]Well, he got it.
[233:59.75]I didn't.
[234:02.27]and uh yeah I don't think I ever will victorian child would probably be pretty good at actual trick shots since that's the closest they would get to video games in their own life yeah what kind of games were they playing back then do you think I think they probably tag
[234:33.36]Probably, you know, tag with sword.
[234:38.95]Back in the medieval times, all kinds of crazy shit was going on.
[234:47.13]Throw the stone in the hole.
[234:48.45]You should play keep driving.
[234:59.34]I'll look it up.
[235:04.08]hopscotch long jump well yeah a lot of the olympic games are what you're describing right is that that's the olympics jump really far throw thing very far lift a big stone and throw big rock here's some behind the scenes for um the streamer games one of the one of the games that that I wanted to do but we didn't we ended up doing it
[235:35.11]It was actually called pick up rock, throw big rock far.
[235:40.35]And it was just going to be a big fucking boulder and like whoever could throw it further.
[235:50.92]But then it was like, how big is this boulder going to be?
[235:52.94]Is it going to be too heavy?
[235:54.70]Is this going to hurt somebody?
[235:57.76]And I wanted a, oh my God, what the fuck?
[236:00.65]This is just rolling.
[236:02.29]All right.
[236:04.01]I kind of was envisioning it was a big caveman boulder.
[236:10.53]But then, yeah, the tungsten cube replaced it.
[236:19.72]Yeah, throw it at somebody's back, yeah.
[236:24.24]The tablecloth pull, that was... I want to see more of that.
[236:28.20]I feel like you could lean into that and make that even more ridiculous and harder.
[236:32.49]Put like oil all over the table or something.
[236:34.29]Make it even more crazy.
[236:43.48]Can you join my Marvel Rivals comp team?
[236:48.94]Yeah, for 30% of the prize money.
[236:54.36]And I, and I don't have to show up to practice and I don't have to play.
[237:00.65]And my name is not even listed on the team roster.
[237:05.29]Your, um, your avatar, like your, your team like avatar, your team logo, uh, gets to be three pixels of my face.
[237:24.10]You get... Jeremiah, your sin is greed.
[237:31.58]Not really, though.
[237:33.14]It definitely is not greed.
[237:49.31]It's probably sloth or pride or... I don't think it's wrath.
[237:54.73]No.
[237:56.03]You know, I'll sit here and I'll be like, the fuck is going on, man?
[238:00.89]The fuck is happening in this fucking world?
[238:03.21]But then I just kind of get like tired and I'm just like, oh, whatever.
[238:06.68]What the fuck?
[238:12.22]Gluttony?
[238:12.78]No.
[238:13.82]Okay.
[238:14.80]I eat pretty well now.
[238:17.63]The last year or so, I've really tried to eat a lot better.
[238:27.16]You drink entire cartons of juice.
[238:29.36]I don't drink entire... Where are you getting this... What, because I drank Holly's apple juice one day?
[238:34.53]Nine months ago?
[238:38.61]Means I drink cartons of juice out of the fridge?
[238:45.31]In a very rare moment of impulse control.
[238:50.23]Oh, fucking ads are going to start playing.
[238:54.39]We got to leave before that happens.
[239:03.88]Actually, I can just turn.
[239:04.68]No, I can just do this.
[239:05.34]I can just turn it off.
[239:09.28]I can just turn it off like that.
[239:10.34]That's easy.
[239:13.27]Hey, look at that.
[239:16.93]Aren't you that mayo fried chicken guy?
[239:18.85]Okay, that food pyramid was a gag.
[239:24.66]I don't eat like nine tablespoons of mayonnaise every day.
[239:30.94]That was a gag and we had fun making it.
[239:40.40]Yeah, it was a gag.
[239:41.50]It was, and by the way, what's even wrong with eating lean turkey and fish and nuts and almonds and stuff?
[239:51.45]That sounds pretty good to me with some, you know, romaine lettuce, radishes.
[240:00.10]I don't even eat fried food anymore.
[240:01.98]I kind of like stopped.
[240:04.88]I'll have the occasional chicken sandwich or chicken cutlet.
[240:10.66]But I don't really eat fried.
[240:11.61]I wish I could still eat it.
[240:13.87]My cholesterol was not great the last time I had blood work done.
[240:17.03]So it's like I kind of need to be careful there.
[240:20.67]Wasn't terrible, but.
[240:24.96]Gotta gotta reduce it a little, right?
[240:37.37]Fried foods not bad with the right oils.
[240:40.63]Yeah.
[240:41.17]I started eating Cheerios too.
[240:46.01]Taking out a lot of oats.
[240:47.68]Not too much though.
[240:48.84]Too much of any of that stuff can just punch you up.
[240:58.06]Do you exercise at all?
[240:59.80]I do.
[241:01.30]I do very lightly.
[241:05.98]I have a... Actually, the thing is pretty great, actually.
[241:10.27]It's one of those mini treadmills.
[241:13.29]So it's not a gigantic, huge, takes up your entire house.
[241:16.99]It's like a car.
[241:18.17]It's effectively like a car parked in your living room.
[241:21.29]No, it's really small.
[241:23.49]It's flat on the ground.
[241:25.90]It takes up very little space.
[241:27.88]It's probably like three feet, maybe like two and a half feet long and maybe like a foot and a half wide.
[241:32.28]It's very small, but it's good.
[241:34.68]You can't really sprint on it, but you can walk at a brisk pace.
[241:39.51]I try to do like a walking pad.
[241:41.71]Yeah.
[241:44.46]You can go... You can zoom on those things.
[241:46.10]You can go pretty... You can go at a pretty fast pace.
[241:50.18]But I've been trying to do one to two miles every few days.
[241:55.79]So trying to get like a mile in every day or two.
[242:03.65]I see it's been working.
[242:04.77]It takes about, you know, if you're walking at like a decent pace, you could do a mile in 12 to 15 minutes.
[242:12.96]Depending on how slow you want to go.
[242:23.50]Should do a stream on the walking pad.
[242:26.28]Nah, that's alright.
[242:27.14]12 is a brisk mile, yeah.
[242:31.83]Typically it's about 15 to 16 minutes.
[242:34.95]I usually do... I can't tell how fast I'm actually going.
[242:40.65]It's enough to make my heart rate go up and to sweat a little, so...
[242:53.92]I enjoy rotting my brain.
[242:55.24]What about you?
[242:55.86]I would say you shouldn't enjoy that.
[242:59.14]And for every minute you enjoy rotting your brain, you should be trying to learn something or trying to do something.
[243:05.38]Hey, we all can take in a little bit of brain rot now and again, but take in an equal amount of other things that stimulate your brain.
[243:15.03]Stimulate you socially too.
[243:32.71]We just watched a trickshot simulator stream, but it was by proxy.
[243:39.21]You watched me watch a trickshot compilation through me doing it through a proxy.
[243:49.76]So there was three or four degrees of separation there.
[243:54.56]That's worse.
[243:58.63]If we talked about educational things, we talked about educational content.
[244:03.60]Bro, shut up.
[244:04.46]Hey, you can't tell me to shut up.
[244:06.52]Wait, wait, wait.
[244:07.70]You're like a 12-month sub.
[244:10.34]You're a three-month sub and you told me to shut up.
[244:15.15]Three-month sub just told me to shut up.
[244:19.01]What the heck?
[244:30.01]Alright, I'm going to get out of here.
[244:33.03]Don't be surprised if there's a stream.
[244:34.39]Probably, I don't know, maybe even tomorrow.
[244:37.34]Kind of into it right now.
[244:50.94]See you in two months.
[244:51.85]No, no, no.
[244:58.33]More like one to two days.
[245:11.02]You're going to sell grotto beasts again.
[245:13.48]We did a. We did a sale.
[245:17.87]Last year, a year ago or so.
[245:19.03]I don't have a plan to.
[245:20.43]I still have some inventory though.
[245:26.49]Um.
[245:32.40]I don't have really any plans on it, but I do still have some inventory.
[245:35.84]So I possibly could put it back up.
[245:40.19]But I don't really have a plan.
[245:42.17]And I don't know.
[245:42.91]I got to see how much is even left of the inventory, honestly.
[245:56.51]Personally, I'm waiting for the lava lamp merch.
[246:06.19]Can you please do the cat puke sound for old time's sake?
[246:09.91]I did the cat- I did that on the, um... Headliner stream.
[246:15.41]I did it a week ago.
[246:20.78]I would drop so much on a lava lamp.
[246:24.92]Yeah, manu- We did the manufacturing thing already.
[246:30.30]And what a pain in the fucking ass.
[246:32.55]That was fucking hell on earth.
[246:36.07]I think we've talked about the, you know, the manufacturing and the distribution of Grotto Beasts and stuff.
[246:40.89]It was fucking crazy.
[246:42.93]So, doing that again, having to do more, have more manufacturing and distribution and stuff.
[246:49.72]Oh boy, oh boy.
[246:51.12]That process would need to be so, so streamlined.
[247:02.08]Glass-based merchandise, yeah.
[247:07.32]If that was ever going to actually happen, I would want to do that through a company who was super fucking with it and in it and a massive company that like, oh yeah, that's what we do.
[247:20.21]We make lava lamps and we've sold fucking 500,000 of them.
[247:24.75]We're that company.
[247:26.97]That's the only way I would do it.
[247:29.03]I ain't doing it from the ground up.
[247:35.88]That's why people study logistics.
[247:37.48]That's why logistics and supply chain are actually really important things.
[247:42.83]They're insanely important and apparently quite difficult to do, honestly.
[247:48.85]So... Get into logistics.
[248:04.16]Can you check your business email?
[248:05.88]Oh, okay.
[248:06.42]So I probably should say this.
[248:08.32]I probably haven't, I haven't said this in a long time.
[248:10.54]It's been probably 10 years since I've, no, it's been like probably three years since I've even mentioned this at all.
[248:14.93]I don't like, I don't check anything.
[248:17.15]Like if anybody's sending emails to like an old business, I don't, that is, I don't even look at it.
[248:24.18]Um, Evolved is the agency that I'm currently represented by.
[248:30.20]I have that evolved email and that's for business stuff and inquiries.
[248:34.71]How do you even say that word?
[248:36.71]Inquiries?
[248:37.79]Is it inquiries?
[248:38.63]It's inquiries.
[248:41.25]You are sloth, definitely.
[248:47.75]True.
[248:53.97]Iron Mouse wants you on her talk show.
[248:57.58]What's the talk show?
[248:59.48]I don't really do anything with anybody anymore.
[249:02.50]I kind of... I'm so bad with other people, I've realized.
[249:22.22]Well, no, I'm not saying that like the content, I'm just saying that me personally, I kind of like, okay, so what do I do?
[249:29.48]How do I talk to you?
[249:30.04]How do I talk to this person?
[249:30.80]How do I talk to that person?
[249:32.59]I've been pretty, over the last 15 years, I mean, you guys all know this.
[249:37.71]I'm very much, I've stayed in the car for most of this entire time I've been doing this.
[249:49.27]Ironmouse is awesome, though.
[249:51.53]I've interacted in passing with Ironmouse before.
[250:01.77]I feel you just overthink it a lot.
[250:04.23]What's the little squirrely guy from Inside Out that's like, oh my god, I don't know what to do about this.
[250:08.92]What's his name?
[250:10.32]Was it Anxiety?
[250:11.12]No.
[250:11.70]It's like, what's his name?
[250:15.96]Fear, but I don't know.
[250:16.92]I feel like it's not fear panic now.
[250:18.96]It's more like I don't know.
[250:19.90]It's more like I just don't know and I really don't care about very much either.
[250:24.71]So it's like an it's like an anxiety on.
[250:27.01]I don't know.
[250:29.67]It's hard to explain.
[250:32.71]Rage.
[250:39.36]Why are you sounding so weird?
[250:41.38]This is scary.
[250:45.44]Hey, this is, you know, back in the day, back in the dinosaur prehistoric 2017, 2016, 2018.
[250:53.88]I know that sounds like, that sounds like the Jurassic Park, Jurassic period.
[251:01.74]We used to sit here for like two hours after streams and just talk like this for hours.
[251:07.86]How the fuck, why the, how the fuck did I do that by the way?
[251:14.08]I would do a second stream after the stream where we just hung out and talked for like three hours after the six or seven hour stream.
[251:20.18]What the hell was I thinking?
[251:27.23]Were you doing coke?
[251:28.31]No, drug free.
[251:30.23]Completely drug free.
[251:35.19]I was running on my own supply back then.
[251:37.65]Like nine, ten hours of just... Yeah, that was all natural.
[251:44.34]Burning fucking both ends of the candle.
[251:46.33]That was drug free.
[252:00.78]Yeah, those 10 to 12 hour kind of 11 hour streams are, yeah, those are a thing of the past.
[252:06.02]That was a six to seven hour stream and then a two to three hour podcast.
[252:09.42]That happened almost every single time I streamed.
[252:28.11]When are you going to do World of Warcraft?
[252:29.29]Probably, I don't know, maybe tomorrow.
[252:33.28]Or Saturday or something.
[252:34.52]Okay, just be on the lookout that over the next 24-ish hours, there'll be another stream.
[252:44.44]That was the best part of your old streams?
[252:45.82]Yeah, but also too, not the, I mean, whatever, we're talking, right?
[252:52.74]But that's, it didn't really sit that well with me after a while.
[252:58.06]I told you this before, but I don't know.
[253:00.90]I just, it got, I don't know, it got weird sometimes or it's just like, not like necessarily weird, but
[253:08.27]I never really liked the idea of somebody paying me money to like, then me to talk to them and not that that was pretty rare.
[253:17.17]You'd see something, but sometimes people would spend a lot of money and you'd see hundreds of dollars come through and it's like, I really hope you can't afford that.
[253:29.61]Uh, and that would happen.
[253:31.41]And I just thought it was healthier.
[253:45.81]Channel points now exist, they could do the same thing.
[253:51.18]Yeah, but I'd rather just have this be we're all just hanging out, having, you know, fun, just fucking around.
[254:00.38]So my DMs are closed.
[254:02.27]I don't really, I don't talk to anybody.
[254:06.39]Just hanging out as a collective unit.
[254:22.07]Channel Point Redemption Update.
[254:23.20]Yes, I actually... I am... I can go through with it.
[254:28.04]It's just going to fundamentally have to change the way that I put my stream out.
[254:34.10]And I don't know if I'm ready to do that.
[254:35.38]And I don't know if I want to do that.
[254:37.80]Maybe we'll talk about this when I bring it up, what it actually is.
[254:42.26]But... It's...
[254:46.06]Okay, okay, okay.
[254:47.98]The thing that I want to do, Twitch is going to consider it gambling.
[254:55.60]Even if it's not technically what it is.
[254:59.11]I still would need to label my streams as like 18 plus gambling.
[255:06.45]And I think that might fuck up my entire channel.
[255:19.43]They already are.
[255:20.13]Well, my streams are mature audience streams, but I would have to physically click the button that says, this is a gambling stream.
[255:30.58]And I think that that might be, that might have some negative repercussions to it.
[255:36.52]I don't know.
[255:37.12]I'd have to really look into it.
[255:43.22]You're retired though, so who cares?
[255:44.74]That's also true too.
[255:47.83]I'm trying to figure out the right way to do it.
[256:00.32]What do you want to do?
[256:01.52]We'll find out.
[256:03.96]How do you know you have to do that?
[256:05.64]I have been talking back and forth through a representative of Twitch TV.
[256:13.03]I'm trying to get answers.
[256:14.29]I've got a few.
[256:18.21]Talking about channel points, yes.
[256:20.79]But channel points being used in a very specific way that is redeeming something.
[256:29.44]And I don't really have time to talk about it, but I will talk about it soon.
[256:33.38]TLDR, we got rid of the kind of subs and bit readings.
[256:38.39]And this is not to dog on anybody that does that.
[256:43.58]It's just me personally, I just... There were a few occasions where I kind of wanted to step back a little from it and go, I... I prefer just kind of... And I have insanely bad ADHD.
[256:54.50]So... They were kind of a distraction too.
[257:03.99]But anyways... I'll see you guys later.
[257:08.81]Take care of yourselves.
[257:10.37]Call your mother if you haven't.
[257:16.11]See you guys in the next day or two.
[257:17.41]Probably going to be another stream like this.
[257:20.13]Just chilling, playing something.
[257:36.18]And yeah.
[257:41.60]Hold on, wait, I want to read this.
[257:46.55]Were you talking in offline chat the other day, or was I dreaming?
[257:51.96]Oh, I pop into offline chat every once in a while.
[257:54.24]Just gotta write a few things.
[258:03.88]So when's Dollhouse 2?
[258:05.84]Dollhouse 2 will only ever be made if it's not Dollhouse 2.
[258:09.18]It would be a different concept.
[258:11.42]Because another dollhouse... And trust me.
[258:15.78]Trust me.
[258:17.83]I don't want to do a Dollhouse 2.
[258:19.63]I want to do... I would want to do something different.
[258:23.27]But it would still be Dollhouse.
[258:30.67]All right, I'll see you guys later.
[258:32.26]Take care of yourselves.
[258:33.36]Have a great night and goodbye.
