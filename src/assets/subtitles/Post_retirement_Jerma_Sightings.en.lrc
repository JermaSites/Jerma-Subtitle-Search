[00:44.44]Oh.
[00:45.02]Has the production planning going since it's a different company this year?
[00:47.04]Really easy actually.
[01:14.09]I really like this.
[01:14.97]I'm using off-brand.
[01:16.37]They've been great so far.
[01:18.03]What's it like working with Jerma?
[01:19.89]He's got a lot of good ideas, some of them that I can't pull off.
[01:25.63]Jerma had a good idea.
[01:26.79]You know how I have coloring books on the table?
[01:29.13]He had a good idea to put playing cards on the tables and then also sell playing cards as merch.
[01:35.49]So we're going to be doing that, which is kind of fun.
[01:37.64]I'll tell you my story from the last, um, cause you know, Jerma was at the last one and I drank all shitload.
[01:43.71]That's like in my prime drinking days.
[01:45.89]And then we went to like a, we went to like a fucking like Jerma restaurant after, and they had Das Boots, which was like 40 or 50 ounces.
[01:57.70]And I got one after the, after the burial cart event, I got 50 more ounces of beer.
[02:02.62]At this point, I'm at least 200 ounces of beer in.
[02:05.78]I'm insane.
[02:06.34]I'm going crazy.
[02:10.91]Jerma looks at me and he goes Wow, you can really put him away.
[02:14.77]I Don't know why fucking killed me.
[02:18.59]He just looked at me and he just the way he looked at me He was just so he was so fascinated.
[02:23.45]I don't know how to explain it.
[02:25.53]He was just so fascinated at what he had seen That one human could just drink this much beer I saw in his eye I
[02:37.61]Let's be honest, what isn't Jerma these days?
[02:39.71]My favorite Jerma is the one who streams Goldeneye, Rick Astley 64 all day.
[02:45.22]He's easily my favorite Jerma.
[02:49.54]I saw a little bit of Jerma's stream and people were like, oh, Jerma, Jerma, you gonna do more collabs?
[02:54.42]And he said, oh, yeah, like, oh, maybe like, oh, yeah, guys, sure, we could do that.
[02:57.74]Like, does, you know, April 4th work for you?
[03:00.80]No, he doesn't reply.
[03:01.72]He doesn't give a date.

[03:16.23]Silence.
[03:22.55]So I hope he entertained you with like two hours of telling you things he's never gonna do.
[03:31.16]Or a Rolls Royce with his own chauffeur.
[03:36.07]He lives in LA?
[03:36.89]I think he lives in Vegas.
[03:40.37]Not to be, like, parasocial.
[03:44.14]He drives a lifted F-150?
[03:45.86]I mean, he had a mullet for a little bit, maybe.
[03:48.56]Yeah, he lives in the Vegas sphere.
[04:00.53]He lives in that big bowl.
