[ve:61.7.100]

[00:02.29]Good afternoon.
[00:04.39]What's going on, everybody?
[00:05.27]How are you?
[00:08.63]Right when I pressed the unmute button, there's a hundred community subs from an anonymous gifter.
[00:17.16]An anonymous person just gave like a trillion dollars worth of money.
[00:22.06]A hundred fucking community subs.
[00:23.56]Thank you for the hundred community subs.
[00:31.95]If you missed the interview, that was fun.
[00:35.11]I don't typically do stuff like that, but it was a really good time.
[00:39.41]Tyler's a really good dude.
[00:42.54]That was a plan for the last year.
[00:44.50]That was a year in the making, just about.
[00:49.62]Or at least six or seven months.
[00:53.68]It's on Valve News Network right now, if you haven't seen it.
[00:57.66]We go over deep shit.
[01:00.85]Like what my first name is.
[01:01.95]Never heard that one before.
[01:07.25]But, hello.
[01:08.47]I am back.
[01:09.70]After another absence.
[01:12.40]I seem to be taking more absences than streaming these days.
[01:16.31]And I do apologize for that, but, you know?
[01:19.85]Shit, you gotta deal with shit, shit happens, right?
[01:23.03]Life happens, right?
[01:28.20]So we were making a return to the 3DO.
[01:32.00]I was gonna do two 3DO days in a row.
[01:33.76]I did one, and then I took off for a week.
[01:38.85]But I'm here now.
[01:40.22]Good to go.
[01:41.64]Excited.
[01:42.02]Because the game we're about to play... Is a game that... This is like... This is gonna suck.
[01:49.86]Because I'm gonna say this and then everyone's gonna be... Including me is gonna be pissed off.
[01:54.04]When this is the worst game of the entire lot.
[01:56.34]Because this is why I got the 3DO.
[01:59.32]The next three games that you're gonna see are the reason why I got this thing.
[02:03.92]So... Let's hope they're okay!
[02:10.68]An absolute shitload of community subs are coming in right now.
[02:13.70]And I am going to address them.
[02:16.04]Oh, that's a lot.
[02:17.63]Non-descript civilian, 10.
[02:19.33]John Cena is kill, 5.
[02:20.95]IA Elliot, 5.
[02:22.43]Non-descript, another 10.
[02:24.49]Jamie, 28035.
[02:26.87]7 from Nocturne.
[02:27.83]6 from Mystic Quests.
[02:30.41]And then $50 from Dupa.
[02:33.91]5,000 bits.
[02:35.41]Thank you guys for the extreme amount of money.
[02:41.09]it's I hope I use it well I really do I say that a lot but I really mean it is he gonna play plumbers without ties I don't know maybe maybe I'll have like a porn day I'm not that's no we're not gonna do a porn day but you know what I mean we'll do like a
[03:07.00]Porn day.
[03:08.36]Hey, 3DO week.
[03:09.44]PS1 week.
[03:10.82]Oh, PS2 classics.
[03:13.48]My favorite porn videos.
[03:15.02]I don't think that would go over very well.
[03:22.59]Porn day.
[03:26.57]Yeah.
[03:27.67]All of my favorite... It would only fit in one day, right, guys?
[03:33.59]Who the fuck are we kidding?
[03:35.18]Don't even try to kid yourself either.
[03:36.58]A porn day?
[03:38.48]That would take like three weeks.
[03:42.16]Oh, porn day.
[03:43.44]Sure.
[03:43.66]Nice lie.
[03:49.88]I just punched the microphone accidentally too.
[03:51.68]Alright, are you ready to do this?
[03:53.44]Are we ready to get another 100 community subs?
[03:55.64]This is ridiculous.
[03:57.12]There's no reason for this.
[03:58.94]There's no reason for this.
[04:00.62]You guys are giving me too much money.
[04:03.77]A hundred more community subs from PQR?
[04:13.58]PQR?
[04:14.28]That's another hundred.
[04:19.28]That's too many.
[04:20.74]That is 100 too many.
[04:23.65]But I will gladly take it and say thank you.
[04:25.31]That's an extreme amount of money.
[04:29.03]You spent $500 to do that.
[04:31.69]That's a lot of fucking money.
[04:36.43]Let's move over to the game because I am ready for it.
[04:39.69]There it is.
[04:40.19]Jurassic Park Interactive.
[04:43.09]This is going to be just as fun as the ride that's at Universal Studios.
[04:48.62]And the ride's not very good.
[04:50.86]So hopefully this is okay.
[04:54.22]It's the same ride, I think.
[04:55.72]I actually think it's just the ride on a disk.
[04:59.50]And I'm starting to realize that right now.
[05:01.40]But no way.
[05:02.22]The back of the box does not show that at all.
[05:06.23]We're getting so many community subs, I can't even keep up with them.
[05:08.55]This is fucking crazy.
[05:09.57]This is too much money.
[05:12.03]You guys are spoiling me.
[05:12.93]You don't need to do this, it's okay.
[05:17.17]I really appreciate it though, thank you everybody.
[05:37.84]Jurassic Park Interactive, here we go.
[05:41.22]Should I do normal, intermediate, or advanced?
[05:45.20]It's not going to be advanced.
[05:46.26]It's going to be A or B. It's just going to be A, right?
[05:55.18]I can't do advanced.
[05:58.75]I'll do B. B sounds fine.
[06:01.37]You ready?
[06:01.75]Oh, I can't wait.
[06:08.91]I can't wait till John Hamm shows up and tells me about what we have to do.
[06:13.71]What's his name?
[06:15.68]Hammond.
[06:16.10]Hammond.
[06:16.56]Hammond.
[06:17.00]Hammond.
[06:17.44]That's his name, right?
[06:22.32]What do we do?
[06:26.02]Okay.
[06:29.45]Security systems.
[06:31.09]Animal systems.
[06:32.57]Engineering.
[06:33.13]Okay, security systems.
[06:35.65]Security systems.
[06:37.80]That's Jon Hamm.
[06:39.34]Who's this?
[06:43.90]Dr. Ellie Sattler.
[06:46.74]Dr. Alan Grant.
[06:49.01]Robert Muldoon.
[06:50.27]Oh, shit.
[06:51.39]These are breakfast cereal actors for the actual actors, aren't they?
[06:55.49]Oh, no.
[06:56.67]Dr. Ian Malcolm.
[07:02.19]Shit.
[07:03.71]Okay, is that supposed to be me?
[07:05.01]Alright, we're gonna go to the Brachiosaurus pen.
[07:09.58]What?
[07:11.08]What was that?
[07:27.54]Malcolm is surrounded by spitters.
[07:29.56]Help him out of the jungle.
[07:31.53]You have a taser weapon.
[07:33.01]Charge it wisely.
[07:34.73]It has- What the fuck?
[07:40.45]How do I move?
[07:43.94]Oh shit!
[07:47.16]Alright, I gotta charge this up and shoot it.
[07:53.78]Why did he run in here?
[07:55.16]What was the point?
[07:58.47]Where's my health?
[08:04.68]I think I'm gonna die.
[08:05.42]That was some Team Rocket shit right there, okay?
[08:17.88]No!
[08:19.44]The screen's going black.
[08:22.66]I'm dead.
[08:32.97]Sorry, you did not make it.
[08:34.83]There may be more stranded guests and staff.
[08:36.97]Check your computer.
[08:37.99]What, is Malcolm dead?
[08:38.89]Alright, what about... Hold on.
[08:46.16]Animal systems.
[08:48.74]Holy shit.
[08:50.68]This is a large game.
[08:52.70]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[08:53.32]We gotta find my favorite dinosaur.
[08:56.46]Oh.
[08:58.40]I mean, that's... That could be me in the costume.
[09:01.67]We have to see.
[09:07.30]Alright.
[09:07.74]Velociraptor.
[09:08.34]Let's go.
[09:09.77]Animal tracking.
[09:10.39]Alright.
[09:11.87]So the Velociraptor is here.
[09:13.93]Okay.
[09:15.05]So let's go to security systems.
[09:19.59]Here we go.
[09:21.09]Okay.
[09:21.73]Tim and Lex.
[09:23.23]Don't put the kids in with the Velociraptor.
[09:25.09]A raptor pen?
[09:32.60]Displaying video.
[09:33.90]Why am I putting kids in a ra- Am I playing Rollercoaster Tycoon?
[09:38.16]Or like Planet Zoo?
[09:39.08]What am I doing?
[09:39.64]I don't get it.
[09:46.04]Lex and Tim are trapped in a park building.
[09:48.30]Help them find their way out.
[09:49.77]You will need to find the keys to get through the locked doors.
[09:53.45]Raptors are here.
[09:54.37]Is this FPS now?
[09:55.97]Are the kids with me?
[09:57.85]Okay, this is actually kind of fucking scary.
[10:08.18]Do I have a punch?
[10:12.82]Walk through.
[10:19.06]Okay, but what am I supposed to do?
[10:25.28]Is he chasing me?
[10:29.07]He's not very fast.
[10:31.21]Okay, so let's just keep going.
[10:32.09]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[10:33.33]There's only one, right?
[10:36.66]What happens if he touches you?
[10:37.82]Do you get killed?
[10:38.46]Block five.
[10:41.38]Block six?
[10:43.94]I have one key?
[10:45.56]Oh, shit.
[10:46.34]This is the... I gotta make this a little suspenseful.
[10:55.72]Does he not care anymore?
[11:02.75]Oh, fuck it!
[11:10.68]I couldn't open the door.
[11:15.42]Okay, that's really, that's clearly a guy in a mask.
[11:17.74]That's great.
[11:19.44]No, it's just a guy in a mask.
[11:20.86]That was a guy in a mask from like Spirit of Halloween.
[11:24.28]Alright, hold on.
[11:26.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[11:27.40]Sensor registers no life signs.
[11:30.09]Oh, there he is, Jon Hamm.
[11:31.99]Select destination.
[11:33.25]Jon Hamm, let's go to, let's go to your house and just hang out.
[11:36.93]Displaying video.
[11:40.14]Camera malfunctioned.
[11:41.43]Uh-oh.
[11:50.03]Hammond is trapped in a park building.
[11:52.15]Help him find his way out.
[11:53.15]You need to find the keys.
[11:54.37]Oh, give me a break.
[11:55.93]You will need to find the keys to get through.
[11:58.35]Alright.
[11:58.61]They all locked in these weird, like, hostile dungeons.
[12:06.23]But where do I find the keys?
[12:08.45]Wait.
[12:10.63]I hope to God it's not a raptor.
[12:12.10]I hope it's another bitmap image of another dinosaur.
[12:15.72]It's better not be a velociraptor.
[12:17.08]Alright, hold on.
[12:19.96]Oh shit, there we go.
[12:21.35]Maintenance area.
[12:28.25]What the fuck just happened?
[12:33.87]What?
[12:34.82]You open the... I have to close the door?
[12:37.30]Everyone's going to die.
[12:40.76]Literally no one's going to make it out alive.
[12:42.26]No one's going to make it out.
[12:45.52]Shit, the ride is more fun than this.
[12:47.25]Oh no.
[12:48.37]What have I done?
[12:49.79]The ride is way more fun.
[12:51.35]Engineering.
[12:52.23]Engineering systems.
[12:55.11]Engineering systems locked out.
[12:56.85]What do you mean locked out?
[12:58.21]What are you talking about?
[13:00.12]Security.
[13:00.46]Level 1 security.
[13:02.76]Access permitted.
[13:03.84]Okay.
[13:06.71]What does that give me?
[13:09.51]It's a music player?
[13:12.35]What?
[13:15.67]I don't remember.
[13:17.64]Okay, you must score 20,000 points to enter the next security level.
[13:21.76]That's not even a spitter.
[13:22.84]That's a gremlin.
[13:29.85]Am I hacking the game?
[13:30.95]It's supposed to be me hacking the computer.
[13:33.07]Like Newman does, right?
[13:37.47]I'll be- I'm gonna actually- I'll be- What do I need?
[13:43.63]10,000?
[13:43.65]20,000 points?
[13:43.89]I'll get it.
[13:44.15]This is the shit that the guy at the security system is doing.
[13:49.33]No, this is not unlocking security shit.
[13:52.63]This is what the security guard is doing.
[13:54.57]He's on miniclip.com all day.
[14:06.25]Alright, 10,000 or was it 20,000?
[14:14.09]Who's the guy?
[14:14.81]Is that supposed to be Newman?
[14:15.61]That's supposed to be Newman, right?
[14:18.80]Whatever his name is in the universe of Jurassic Park.
[14:21.30]What is it?
[14:28.47]I really hope Security Clearance 2 is not this again, but with other pictures.
[14:34.53]He's the best security in the world.
[14:36.89]He's not bad.
[14:41.37]Could be better.
[14:43.39]Okay, there's 20,000 incoming.
[14:46.48]You can still shoot when you're dead, by the way.
[14:47.82]Now that's the real glitch way to win.
[14:52.28]20,000.
[14:52.38]Okay, so should I just die?
[14:57.49]Just let the things kill me because I get to 20,000?
[14:59.28]Alright, just kill me.
[15:10.47]I got to 20,000.
[15:11.33]It's 30,000?
[15:13.43]It's 30,000 points?
[15:14.21]Oh my god.
[15:14.93]Thank god.
[15:15.41]No, no, no, no, no.
[15:16.01]I can't die here.
[15:16.69]Okay, actually, I'm gonna set the fuck up and play well.
[15:18.65]I don't wanna die.
[15:28.78]I'll get her here, right?
[15:30.24]I'll get her right here.
[15:37.72]I did it.
[15:38.28]Level 2.
[15:39.88]Level 2 security.
[15:42.17]Access permitted.
[15:42.97]Yeah, I got level 2 access.
[15:45.83]You unlocked Winnie the Pooh baseball.
[15:49.09]Oh, it actually is Winnie the Pooh.
[15:50.31]It's just Flashkin.
[15:51.53]Okay.
[15:54.88]Alright, 20,000.
[15:55.20]You know, I'm going to do it, because why not?
[16:02.75]It's Galaga.
[16:03.69]This is actually kind of fun, though.
[16:07.57]Alright, I'm curious.
[16:08.57]I want to sit here for a little bit.
[16:13.23]It's Chex Quest.
[16:18.08]Okay.
[16:24.78]It's hard to dodge that.
[16:25.62]The screen's tiny.
[16:30.01]Please stop.
[16:30.79]No, not yet.
[16:31.41]I have to get to level... I gotta get to security clearance level 5.
[16:35.61]And then after security clearance level 5, I'll open Jon Hamm's door.
[16:41.81]I'll at least save... I gotta save one person.
[16:43.62]Okay, the back of the CD has, like, you riding in a car and...
[16:52.25]The T-Rex chasing you.
[16:53.43]Spoilers, but this franchise is like 25 years old at this point.
[16:57.34]How do I do that?
[17:02.78]Did it.
[17:03.02]Okay, alright.
[17:04.30]Move up to level three.
[17:04.90]Why is he a pirate now?
[17:09.23]Level three security.
[17:12.03]Access permitted.
[17:13.67]What am I doing this for?
[17:14.73]I don't know what I'm doing it for.
[17:21.39]I'm playing Ong versus a dinosaur.
[17:24.51]I don't want to do this one.
[17:30.42]I, like, don't actually want to play this one.
[17:32.36]Wait, why is it just turning into the guy from Dinosaurs, the TV show?
[17:38.22]Remember that show?
[17:49.06]It was like the Muppets, they were the big puppet dinosaur things.
[17:54.95]Didn't that show end really horribly too?
[17:56.85]Didn't like a fucking meteor hit the Earth or something at the end of the last episode?
[18:01.61]Something horrible, right?
[18:07.25]Yeah, yeah, something horrible did happen.
[18:09.17]That's really fucked up.
[18:19.13]I used to love the baby.
[18:19.97]The baby was the best.
[18:26.58]And by the way, every single family-oriented cartoon with a family of people was all based on the dinosaurs.
[18:33.72]Family Guy, Simpsons, they all came after dinosaurs.
[18:39.90]The big fat dad who's kind of dumb, but he means well.
[18:43.28]The baby, that kid has magical powers and is funny and is sinister.
[18:49.16]Simpsons fucking copied dinosaurs.
[18:50.78]Alright, I just lose.
[18:58.16]I got $20,000.
[18:59.44]Flintstones.
[19:00.96]Oh, they got inspiration from the Flintstones, not the other way around.
[19:04.14]That's a woke take.
[19:20.52]I don't want to play anymore.
[19:22.00]Just let me just get the security level five.
[19:24.48]I'm trying to lose.
[19:32.09]This is, this is, hold on.
[19:33.29]This is even the dinosaur's theme song.
[19:38.25]This is the shit that plays when the big dinosaur guy's driving his car to work.
[19:51.91]Okay, security level five.
[19:55.05]I'm gonna do this.
[19:59.53]Do the baby impression.
[20:01.46]Something like that, right?
[20:08.82]You might actually think I'm making that part up.
[20:10.22]He actually says that part.
[20:11.58]He actually says what I just said.
[20:17.22]I didn't read this.
[20:25.70]Yeah, let's respect nature and the dinosaurs!
[20:30.62]Arm the laser cannon!
[20:32.72]And shoot them!
[20:49.55]Fuck.
[20:49.77]Alright, what is it, 20,000?
[20:53.20]Oh, spawn camp, spawn camp, spawn camp, fix it!
[20:57.49]Fucking Activision.
[20:59.03]Fucking idiots.
[21:02.45]Did I do my good, like, fake, like, pissed off thing?
[21:13.28]You guys like that?
[21:13.86]Did you like it?
[21:16.30]Why move?
[21:19.79]I got this all wrong.
[21:20.55]Why move at all?
[21:21.67]I think they just keep spawning, yeah.
[21:31.15]This sort of reminds me of what a really over-enthusiastic history teacher would do.
[21:38.70]Like a science teacher.
[21:39.64]This is like an over-enthusiastic science teacher's little side project that the kids get to play for like 15 minutes at the end of class.
[21:50.69]And although you don't think it's very fun, you don't have to listen to him talk.
[21:55.93]So this is the alternative, and it's better.
[22:12.44]This game probably took dozens of people to make.
[22:17.81]Yeah, the 3DO is awesome.
[22:19.55]I love this thing.
[22:22.31]I'm going to wrap this thing.
[22:23.89]I'm going to laminate my 3DO.
[22:26.95]And I'm never touching it ever again after this.
[22:38.97]3DO sucks.
[22:39.76]No, it doesn't.
[22:40.30]3DO is pretty fun.
[22:42.92]They made this in Microsoft Publisher.
[22:47.34]It was probably made in Adobe Director or something back then.
[22:50.64]I have to die now.
[22:56.05]Alright, it's fun.
[23:03.61]What do you get for doing this, though?
[23:05.96]That's why I have to do this.
[23:09.38]Does he know the 3DO sucks?
[23:10.78]It doesn't, though.
[23:12.74]This is fun.
[23:13.42]Interactive media.
[23:14.40]Alright, level 5.
[23:15.18]This is it.
[23:17.06]Security clearance level 5.
[23:18.11]What's number 5?
[23:29.45]Okay, this is rap attack.
[23:38.10]Oh no.
[23:39.80]No!
[23:41.88]The science teacher roped in the math teacher to make their own and showed him how easy it was.
[23:46.65]Now we gotta play the same game next period.
[24:00.68]20,000.
[24:00.70]And then what?
[24:04.24]It's just asteroid.
[24:06.18]Horrible.
[24:06.70]You can die by the fan.
[24:11.68]What's with the environmental damage?
[24:13.16]That's not cool.
[24:16.49]NA classes.
[24:19.79]Don't you guys know NA classes were wheel the TV in, play a movie, or look at this cool shitty thing that one of the teachers made and we're all going to exploit for the next six weeks?
[24:29.16]Or get everybody into the gym to sit there and here's an assembly for two hours.
[24:33.44]I don't think we learned anything.
[24:37.78]I don't think I learned anything.
[24:46.24]No, no, no, you know what?
[24:46.98]I learned how to go to the bathroom really fucking fast, because apparently if you took more than one minute to go to the bathroom, you were like a terrible student.
[24:53.42]That's what I learned in an N.A.
[24:55.84]education.
[24:57.52]Can I go to the bathroom?
[24:58.72]Yes, you can, but hurry the fuck up!
[25:01.11]Okay, okay, yeah, I'll pee, pee, and it hurts!
[25:03.07]It hurts, I'm peeing as hard as I can, it hurts!
[25:06.91]Get out of the bathroom.
[25:07.71]Ow!
[25:07.85]What are you doing in the hall?
[25:09.79]I decided to go to the bathroom.
[25:11.03]Yeah, prove it!
[25:12.33]Okay, I'm going back to class.
[25:13.57]Get back there!
[25:17.66]That's what I learned.
[25:26.01]And then all of a sudden, one of the exits would open.
[25:28.43]It's like one of the bad kids.
[25:31.37]Hey man, you wanna skip class and go see X-Men?
[25:37.65]No, no, I'm okay.
[25:38.93]Yeah, I do, but no.
[25:51.39]Did I, like, get a level two?
[25:52.25]This is sick.
[25:55.56]You are a loser.
[25:57.16]Shut up.
[26:05.50]It was always that group that like... And guess what?
[26:09.40]There were people that I knew.
[26:10.96]I mean, I weren't friends with them necessarily, but you knew some of these people that were in your class or something.
[26:17.79]They'd walk into class and they would just smell the bottom of a bowl.
[26:21.39]You know what I mean?
[26:21.89]Just like, oh, yeah, you must have... Okay, you... Alright, that's what you were just doing somewhere, I guess.
[26:33.40]Yeah, that is a marijuana reference.
[26:36.62]It's just like, oh, yeah, alright.
[26:38.24]Well... Hey, what do you think?
[26:41.45]Good?
[26:42.19]Yeah, I'm alright.
[26:42.71]I'm good.
[26:44.75]Cool.
[26:46.15]CBD.
[26:54.80]This actually can't be what NA education is.
[26:58.56]No, that wasn't the teacher.
[27:00.15]That was not the teacher.
[27:02.17]The teacher comes and sits down, and it smells like weed.
[27:06.29]Hey, yeah, yeah, how you doing, kids?
[27:08.71]Hey, hey, hey, you wanna go see... Hey, fuck this class.
[27:11.01]Y'all wanna go see X-Men?
[27:18.15]Who wants to go... Hey, who wants to go see X-Men?
[27:20.17]Why does everybody have to turn into Mr. Satan?
[27:25.91]Alright, you do know what to do next, do you?
[27:27.83]No, I don't.
[27:30.61]Oh shit, I was supposed to do that.
[27:33.55]What?
[27:39.09]Alert.
[27:39.93]I was supposed to do that.
[27:41.01]That was... Return to Priority 1 Command.
[27:45.02]Return to Isla Nublar Priority 1 Command.
[27:52.74]Will comply.
[27:53.34]ETA 16 hours.
[27:54.44]Two crewmen lost.
[27:56.72]And two kids.
[27:57.56]Write two kids as well.
[27:58.58]I know you don't want to take the blame for that, but that's what happened.
[28:01.58]Two kids are dead too.
[28:07.04]Okay.
[28:07.54]Is that what I need to do?
[28:09.34]Level 5 security.
[28:12.21]Access permitted.
[28:14.23]Wait, we just go right to level 5 security clearance?
[28:18.66]No, dude, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[28:21.74]No, no, no, no, just crash into stuff.
[28:25.52]How am I still alive?
[28:36.14]So many community subs are coming, oh my fucking god.
[28:40.89]I can't even read all these, there's so many.
[28:45.07]DestroyDude5, Chungi5, JermaSucks5, TigerFam5.
[28:50.84]No, that's a zero on there.
[28:52.82]I didn't see the zero.
[28:53.58]That's 50 community subs from TigerFam.
[28:58.68]Holy shit, guys.
[28:59.92]Another... You guys, this is like 600 subs over the last 15 minutes.
[29:06.00]Thank you, TigerFan, for the 50.
[29:07.19]That's insane.
[29:08.99]Adan, thanks for the 5.
[29:10.47]And Koilia is a gamer.
[29:12.33]Thanks for the 8.
[29:14.45]Please just let me die.
[29:17.21]Why can I not crash?
[29:21.52]Will we ever make him cry again?
[29:23.34]I don't have a reason to cry right now.
[29:28.32]Okay, get me out of here.
[29:30.76]Now, what does that do for me?
[29:32.90]Alright, there's Dr. Alan Grant.
[29:34.25]He's in the restroom.
[29:36.65]Wait, he's just in the bathroom?
[29:39.85]Garage.
[29:40.19]Garage!
[29:41.43]Time for the car.
[29:52.87]Okay, is this security feed of Jurassic Park, or is this security feed of, like, people running away from the house when, like, dad gets home?
[30:02.16]Like, you had somebody over that wasn't supposed to be there, and they, like, snuck out the window.
[30:11.46]Help grant to safety.
[30:12.32]Use the explorer to get to the next safe location.
[30:14.33]Oh, my God.
[30:15.15]Save game.
[30:15.91]Soundtrack on.
[30:16.97]Sound effects on.
[30:17.73]Time left warned.
[30:19.61]Why am I getting...
[30:22.10]Mirror.
[30:22.64]View.
[30:23.52]Wait, steering is L and R?
[30:28.54]Okay, brake, accelerate, turn.
[30:31.67]Mirror steering is L and R. What?
[30:39.35]Wait, he's already right there!
[30:42.29]He's already right behind us!
[30:48.91]Oh shit, I ran over some twigs!
[30:52.00]Objects in mirror are closer than they appear.
[30:54.26]Rab, really?
[30:55.30]Do you really need... I know the dinosaur is huge.
[31:03.45]Holy shit, he's right there.
[31:04.73]Wait.
[31:19.72]Okay, did I crash and did Grant go through the windshield?
[31:22.92]Or did the T-Rex eat us?
[31:24.78]I don't know.
[31:35.73]Okay, he's dead.
[31:36.53]Those kids are dead.
[31:40.07]John Hammond is dead.
[31:41.33]What about the weird guy?
[31:44.29]Select destination.
[31:47.24]Okay, um, should I go in the shed?
[31:50.38]Back to the garage?
[31:51.98]How about shed two?
[31:55.40]Displaying video.
[32:01.35]It's going to be him running.
[32:02.25]Yeah.
[32:05.91]Where is that son of a bitch?
[32:07.11]I know he was in here.
[32:08.85]You can't lie to me, Cindy.
[32:10.67]I know that little fucking asshole was here.
[32:12.78]I told you not to have him in my house.
[32:25.01]We have a taser!
[32:26.07]Oh my god, not this shit again.
[32:37.48]No!
[32:38.10]It's... How am I supposed to kill all these things?
[32:52.34]Alright, he's dead.
[32:54.06]They're all running into the woods and dying because I can't save them.
[33:02.63]Guess when?
[33:03.85]I can't.
[33:04.51]Is there anybody left on the island?
[33:08.81]Should I just leave?
[33:11.68]This was just a really complicated VR.
[33:16.78]Okay, Robert Muldoon.
[33:18.02]This is the guy that's like, she's got you.
[33:20.56]Run.
[33:21.28]Right?
[33:24.26]Select destination.
[33:25.30]Alright.
[33:26.86]What about the Brachiosaur pen?
[33:28.14]I don't think we... Did we go there?
[33:30.90]Restroom.
[33:32.86]T-Rex.
[33:33.60]Alright.
[33:34.72]We got some choices here.
[33:35.68]T-Rex paddock.
[33:38.87]Restroom.
[33:41.05]Or the Brachiosaur pen.
[33:44.07]I don't want to... This is going to be another Velociraptors just in the shed.
[33:48.03]T-Rex paddock.
[33:51.05]Toilet.
[33:54.10]Alright, toilet.
[33:56.88]Displaying video.
[34:00.30]Camera malfunction here.
[34:09.12]Muldoon is trapped in the bathroom.
[34:11.03]Help him find his way out.
[34:12.05]You need to find your... Oh, it's this shit again.
[34:14.47]It's this shit.
[34:17.59]It's this stupid thing.
[34:18.81]He's trapped in the bathroom.
[34:20.21]Okay, well, whatever.
[34:21.31]I'm just gonna go here.
[34:24.98]And just run.
[34:25.92]He's always right behind you.
[34:26.89]Just go.
[34:27.33]Run.
[34:27.49]Block two.
[34:29.93]I don't know.
[34:30.25]Just run.
[34:30.53]It's high voltage.
[34:32.87]Drop that on him.
[34:33.41]He'll electrocute him, right?
[34:35.97]Can I drop it?
[34:37.49]Oh, shit.
[34:37.87]Nice.
[34:38.53]Okay.
[34:38.67]He'll get killed.
[34:45.92]He's not going to be right here, is he?
[34:53.08]Oh, shit.
[34:53.58]It's just a big... Drop it.
[34:56.85]Drop it.
[34:57.59]Drop it.
[34:58.53]Drop it.
[34:58.77]Drop it.
[34:59.11]Oh, my... What?
[35:04.61]He was waiting for me on the other side of the door.
[35:06.63]He wasn't running around.
[35:14.98]Clever girl.
[35:20.34]They're all dead.
[35:20.86]Whatever.
[35:21.18]I'm going... I want to go to the T-Rex pen and just, like, take photos.
[35:26.40]Who else is alive?
[35:27.04]Oh, wait.
[35:27.42]Dr. Ellie Sattler.
[35:30.14]Everyone else is dead.
[35:30.78]Okay.
[35:32.82]We have to save Ellie.
[35:36.85]At the restroom.
[35:38.65]No.
[35:40.31]At the raptor pen.
[35:42.27]Oh, my fucking god.
[35:43.61]Raptor pen.
[35:45.05]Displaying video.
[35:57.81]There's a lot of people leaving out of this person's room late at night, apparently.
[36:02.65]There's a lot of people leaving.
[36:09.82]How much footage of people, like, running away from the house do you have here?
[36:14.60]Already!
[36:15.16]Okay, go, go, go, go, go, go, go, drive!
[36:20.89]Why are there fucking dinosaur bones in the middle of the road?
[36:29.48]Alright, 1.4.
[36:30.02]1.3.
[36:30.34]Okay, I have to drive 1.3 miles.
[36:36.19]This is gonna take forever.
[36:43.29]I have to save one person.
[36:53.28]I have to save Dr. Ellie.
[36:57.87]Come on, this is my favorite character.
[36:59.29]When she puts her hand on the Triceratops' belly and says goodbye.
[37:03.73]Oh, that was such a touching moment for us all.
[37:08.67]What?
[37:11.09]This is impossible.
[37:11.79]It's not possible to drive.
[37:13.35]It's impossible.
[37:14.23]It's not possible.
[37:15.19]It's impossible.
[37:16.45]I should have done normal.
[37:24.89]Okay, dude, you didn't do very well saving people.
[37:27.49]You did notify the cargo ship in time.
[37:30.81]Rating, Brachius.
[37:37.66]How did I notify the cargo ship?
[37:41.70]Is that the computer hacking?
[37:59.09]Wait, what's going on?
[38:01.82]Why did he move?
[38:02.74]His face just moved.
[38:03.68]His face just moved.
[38:10.44]Okay, well that was Jurassic Park Interactive.
[38:14.41]It was... That was the science teacher.
[38:18.13]There he was.
[38:28.63]Okay, let's move on.
[38:30.29]Let me just take this out.
[38:33.19]I liked that one.
[38:34.01]It was terrible, but I loved it.
[38:36.93]Did I miss anything in it?
[38:42.96]No, we saw it all.
[38:44.72]Nothing else to say, really.
[38:48.46]While I get the next CD, you can watch the intro video.
[38:50.38]It's pretty cool.
[38:52.88]Make a listen.
[39:05.02]Coming up next, we have something that I just want to get out of the way.
[39:09.48]Because I know that this is going to be... It's not going to be very good, but it doesn't matter.
[39:15.86]Next one is called Club 3DO Station Invasion On The Air.
[39:22.17]This is a... This is like Nickelodeon Magazine, the CD.
[39:27.85]That's how I can describe it, the way it looks.
[39:36.01]Is this just the actual intro to Jurassic Park?
[39:37.76]I didn't even watch this.
[39:45.99]Oh yeah, I know what this is.
[39:47.57]This is torrent underscore zero four four two point one zero underscore torrent jurassic park full movie underscore one one one one underscore two.
[40:00.42]Jurassic Park, located on an island off the coast of Costa Rica, was conceived and built by John Hammond.
[40:07.12]Hammond, an extremely wealthy dinosaur fanatic, and his company, InGen Corporation, leased the island of Isla Nublar from the government.
[40:15.81]Okay, you already know the story.
[40:16.91]Let's play Station Invasion, Club 3DO.
[40:18.63]You're going to get bars across your screen.
[40:23.05]Just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[40:24.51]3DO, just through the way that it's getting captured, it's going to be like, incoming in about three seconds.
[40:29.69]Three, two, one.
[40:32.00]Maybe not.
[40:38.65]Alright, coming up, here comes Station Invasion Club 3DO.
[40:45.67]No idea, I don't even know why I got this.
[40:49.36]The inside cover, there's a dog with a suit on.
[40:52.00]So... I got high hopes.
[41:00.65]Show dog.
[41:02.11]I will.
[41:02.91]Hold on, let me just get it in.
[41:05.57]God, I love this 3DO.
[41:09.18]Let's go.
[41:17.63]Joe Otto.
[41:20.67]No, not right now.
[41:22.33]He's sleeping behind me.
[41:31.00]This one's kind of... Can you hear the disk chugger?
[41:34.04]It's going... Sounds like a PlayStation 3...
[41:40.05]I almost said two.
[41:45.51]Alright.
[41:47.03]Love 3DO Station Invasion.
[41:49.60]Alright, awesome start.
[41:56.31]Here's the TV station.
[41:59.44]Oh, it must have been really fucking failing.
[42:28.68]It must have been free.
[42:30.28]I mean look, I know my ratings haven't been that great lately, but the babes still dig me, huh?
[42:58.49]He's not talking about... Wait, what?
[42:59.47]What's that shoe in there?
[43:00.35]That is an elaborate fucking shoe.
[43:03.01]Okay, now get rid of that guy.
[43:05.39]No, get rid of that guy.
[43:23.91]Am I going to be a producer?
[43:25.25]But I'm not a kid.
[43:26.75]Me.
[43:53.68]Yeah, that makes more sense.
[43:55.02]Why are they all the same dialog though?
[44:08.97]Why does everything have to end in let's do lunch sometime?
[44:11.03]It's just the writer just didn't care.
[44:12.27]That was how to end a sentence.
[44:19.09]Even if it was like a 40-year-old talking to an 11-year-old.
[44:22.11]Like, I just want to do lunch sometime?
[44:23.57]I don't know how to end sentences.
[44:24.61]I love this board.
[44:26.11]This is awesome.
[44:26.73]It's got a baseball mitt too.
[44:39.25]I'm Ernie Golucky, host of What's That Smell?

[44:48.87]The celebrity brings some gross concoction for the contestant.
[44:52.90]Abuse adults?
[44:54.14]Like, just, like, let's torture adults?

[45:22.77]What happened to the missing sock?
[45:24.60]Why is there always one shoe lying at the side of the road?
[45:28.04]I don't think of Mystery Smistries as a show as much as I think of it as a journey.
[45:33.96]Okay.
[45:35.25]My name is Angelica Dujour, star of the soap opera Sundays of Our Lives.

[48:42.90]Mystery's Mysteries, produced by Jeremy.
[48:48.35]We need a lot of tomato juice for tomorrow's episode on why tomato juice is used to get rid of the smell of skunk.
[48:53.98]We need to figure out how much we need and how much it will cost.
[48:56.28]There's a lot more to do before tomorrow, so you better get right on with it.
[48:58.50]I didn't pick the smell TV one.
[48:59.38]I'm actually a little irritated about this, Mr. Mystery's Mystery.
[49:01.48]I thought we were going to be solving mysteries, not smelly puke stuff.

[49:09.78]Let's solve the problem.
[49:11.30]Oh, shit.
[49:12.70]Wait, it's a math problem.
[49:14.10]Two, seven, uh...
[49:22.71]12, 6 divided by... Where's the 3?
[49:27.53]No, where's the... I didn't lose yet.
[49:36.80]I need a 4.
[49:38.02]Sick.
[49:38.12]4 divided by 1 divided by 4 is 4.
[49:39.28]Where's the 1?
[49:39.60]16, 4, 8, 12, 16, 4, 8, 12, say that again.
[49:40.18]8, 8, 12, 6, 12, I don't know.
[49:51.81]Six, so divided by two, four, six, eight, 10, 12.
[49:55.03]Okay, now we got 32, 39.
[49:55.99]12 divided by, no, what is it?
[49:58.53]What is it?
[49:59.57]What is it?
[50:00.05]What is it?
[50:00.49]What is it?
[50:00.87]What is it?
[50:01.33]What is it?
[50:02.13]What is it?
[50:02.47]What is it?
[50:02.91]What is it?
[50:03.19]12?
[50:03.23]No, no, no, it's like eight.
[50:04.93]It's like three.
[50:05.43]What is it?
[50:05.81]What is it?
[50:06.09]It's three.
[50:06.52]Done.
[50:07.36]Yeah, he's smart as hell.
[50:19.34]Jeremy gained six points.
[50:21.22]That would be the Ukalaka tribal victory dance.
[50:23.52]Feel free to join in at any time.
[50:26.60]How is this a mystery?
[50:28.53]This is doing shitty math problems.
[50:30.81]Come on, you gotta put two human hands up.
[50:33.13]Like Swedish chef style.
[50:33.97]Damn it.
[50:50.58]This is just a Mario Party, but this is the twisted game, but with kids.
[50:54.66]Let's look at a clip from one of this week's top shows.
[50:59.41]Alright, here we go.
[51:07.15]Why do people pick their noses when they get in their car?
[51:09.99]It's not like we can't see them.
[51:11.91]Why do they do it?
[51:14.81]What luck.
[51:15.43]We just caught Dak Jones.
[51:17.10]Not if you have tinted windows.
[51:22.37]What's this guy doing over here, by the way?
[51:25.71]I don't think it's that gross.
[51:41.99]Well, we brought a gross meter with us, Dak.
[51:43.86]A gross meter?
[51:44.34]Let's just see how your pick scores.
[51:45.76]It's a 2 out of 10.
[51:47.08]Those meters don't prove anything.
[51:48.84]No, they don't.
[51:49.44]They aren't even accepted in a court of law.
[51:51.24]That's bullshit.
[51:52.04]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[51:52.80]I disagree.
[51:53.44]Disagree.
[51:53.88]That's a 1 or a 2 out of 10.
[51:56.95]I hate you, kid.
[51:58.01]Now, if he ate it, it would have been an 8.
[52:00.15]He didn't, though.
[52:02.09]That was great.
[52:03.75]Don't you think, John?
[52:11.30]Who is that guy?
[52:15.03]That guy in the background at the newspaper stand is scaring me.
[52:19.55]He's freaking me out.
[52:24.32]Where are the cue cards?
[52:25.34]They're all gone.
[52:26.68]I never remember my lines.
[52:28.98]You have to help me.
[52:30.20]I know you're not a script writer, but you're going to have to be for today.
[52:34.37]What does that entail?
[52:35.05]Let's see.
[52:35.65]Rewrite.
[52:36.07]Select each word requested by using the joypad and the A button.
[52:39.38]Is Mad Libs?
[52:40.60]I'm pretty good at these.
[52:42.04]Alright.
[52:42.98]Pick a verb.
[52:43.58]A verb.
[52:44.06]Okay.
[52:46.34]Creepy.
[52:47.20]Pizza.
[52:47.78]A verb.
[52:48.92]Smuggles.
[52:50.30]Scatters.
[52:51.00]Cleans.
[52:52.20]Syrupy.
[52:53.17]Hot.
[52:54.03]Hot can be a verb, right?
[52:55.03]How about cleans?
[52:56.01]Cleans is a verb.
[52:57.33]You're cleaning something.
[52:58.23]Clean.
[52:58.81]Pick an adjective.
[52:59.77]Adjective.
[53:04.06]Stale.
[53:06.54]Pick a verb.
[53:07.10]A verb.
[53:08.02]I have one second left.
[53:19.03]Wow, that wasn't very good, was it?
[53:20.59]I didn't realize there was a timer.
[53:23.09]I agree, John.
[53:25.84]This week was fabulous.
[53:27.44]Let's look at the ratings.
[53:31.55]Not even a bark?
[53:35.61]He lost it ma- I thought it was Mad Libs.
[53:37.54]I didn't think it was a- I can actually get it correct.
[53:46.54]Better be mine.
[53:47.38]No!
[53:47.68]I don't wanna watch this shit.
[54:07.95]Send in young parsley flavors.
[54:10.59]Very good, dear.
[54:11.37]Don't you think it's interesting that in the kids' TV where they want to get rid of all the adults, all the kids just pretend to be adults?
[54:22.04]Darling, give the girl a break.
[54:23.46]It's weird, right?
[54:23.96]You are so hard on her.
[54:26.20]Oh, Nick.
[54:27.38]I mean, sire.
[54:36.71]That kid had mustache hair?
[54:37.95]Yeah, good.
[54:43.65]Mustache hair is going to become a big trend sooner or later, and then everyone's going to look back and be like, wow, I know where that started.
[54:49.56]This guy.
[54:53.28]Alright, now I understand.
[54:54.50]It's vocabulary.
[54:58.19]Neither do I. You're asking the wrong person.
[55:00.43]Select two pieces to exchange using the joypad and the A button.
[55:03.15]Press the C button when done.
[55:03.85]What do you mean?
[55:28.61]George Frederick... Michelson... Waterbender!
[55:31.82]Look at this big-ass hair!
[55:43.52]I don't... George Frederick Handel's water music was performed on a boat for King George I of England.
[55:58.08]Nice.
[55:59.56]We're gonna get our show on TV today.
[56:00.72]Yes!
[56:00.86]And it was the same clip twice in a row.
[56:02.34]That's how you can tell it was even better.
[56:30.51]Alright, let's see what we got on TV.
[56:33.73]How would you like to see a clip from one of those shows?
[56:40.89]I thought that was funny.
[56:42.15]You did too.
[56:42.97]I don't care if it's 11 year olds.
[56:44.63]I laughed at it.
[56:45.17]I don't care.
[56:56.03]Hey, how many of you guys used to have contests of who could throw that fucking exact football as far as possible?
[57:00.81]I thought I'd come over and say hi.
[57:03.19]They didn't even play catch.
[57:04.93]Wow.
[57:06.07]That's great.
[57:08.91]Hey, you want to come up?
[57:09.81]There's a ladder over there.
[57:11.25]It's just a bunch of fucking eighth graders blow out their arms trying to one-up each other.
[57:16.92]Betty Primrose, just what do you think you're doing on that ladder?
[57:20.08]What?
[57:20.40]Hi, Mr. Sparks.
[57:21.08]Oh.
[57:22.98]Guess what, Billy?
[57:24.52]Is this the angry dad?
[57:25.48]Igor does this a thousand times and never gets caught.
[57:29.92]Bet he has to come over once.
[57:31.86]Wait.
[57:32.90]Once.
[57:35.34]That's the thing that was happening in Jurassic Park.
[57:40.57]Woo, this new kid TV is a powerhouse, producing some top drawer entertainment.
[57:46.03]Don't you think, John?
[57:49.65]A dog.
[57:50.25]I love that dog.
[57:53.95]Okay, fourth week of kid TV season.
[57:56.57]When do we get canceled?
[57:59.13]On week five?
[57:59.57]Okay, what problems?
[58:00.21]Oh dear, this is not gonna go well.
[58:21.80]Mammal.
[58:22.18]Okay, mammal is... That's an elephant.
[58:26.18]An insect.
[58:26.92]That is a fly.
[58:29.06]That is a goldfish.
[58:32.10]An amphibian.
[58:33.02]That would be a frog.
[58:34.98]A bird.
[58:36.07]That would be a chicken.
[58:38.19]Reptile.
[58:38.85]That would be a turtle.
[58:39.47]That was easy.
[58:47.04]That was a very respectable performance.
[58:48.95]Why was I talking as if... Why was I talking like that was impressive?
[58:58.25]Hello, everyone.
[58:59.89]Boy, we came on so soon.
[59:01.47]I didn't realize.
[59:02.51]I'm like Billy Madison.
[59:03.75]I'm like sitting in a third grade class as a 35-year-old.
[59:07.27]That's a turtle.
[59:08.13]I win.
[59:08.55]I'm smarter than all these children.
[59:14.27]Jeremy, we don't win in class.
[59:16.62]Oh, wow.
[59:18.00]You sure?
[59:19.76]I do.
[59:22.46]And as usual, we follow the ratings chart with a clip of one of those shows.
[59:31.57]Smarter than a fifth grader.
[59:35.77]Do a Jerma Madison stream.
[59:38.71]What, where I... That would take a lot of convincing.
[59:41.80]You understand?
[59:43.68]What's he holding?
[59:44.12]What the hell is this thing?
[59:45.62]This is not a real thing, right?
[59:47.73]Isn't this the thing you skipped over?
[60:14.65]Alright, what is this supposed to do?
[60:18.73]What is that supposed to be doing?
[60:20.01]This is great.
[60:23.42]I can feel my fanny shrinking already.
[60:26.14]And it's fun, too.
[60:27.68]Let's flash the 800 number for people to order this fantastic device.
[60:33.07]One buy buy.
[60:34.33]We take cash.
[60:35.73]If it gets lost in the mail, it's not our fault.
[60:39.69]What the hell was that?
[60:41.79]You put a thing around your waist and you have a... What's that thing called?
[60:45.96]Skip it, skip it, skip... What's the song called, right?
[60:50.85]The thing that used to trip a bunch of kids and... What was that thing called?
[60:57.61]We need a lot of tomato juice for tomorrow's episode on why tomato juice is used to get rid of the smell of skunk.
[61:03.23]We need to figure out how much we need and how much it will cost.
[61:05.51]Yeah, how many of you guys used to cheat with the skippit?
[61:07.73]You just put the hoop under one of your ankles and you spun it as fast as you possibly could to try to get like a thousand points by cheating.
[61:20.16]Oh shit, I went and said, what does 3.45 minus... I don't know.
[61:22.64]I don't know.
[61:24.22]The cashier does this for me.
[61:25.32]I don't do this.
[61:26.38]They just tell me a number.
[61:28.83]Uh, 120.
[61:28.95]Which is 3.24 plus 4.25 plus 1.
[61:29.81]That would be 4, 5, 6, 6, 24, 6, 7, 765.
[61:32.41]Which is 3, that's 4, 3, 2, 4, 6, 3, 3, 6, 3, 75.
[61:33.23]Almost.
[61:58.70]Some mysteries are tougher than others.
[62:00.91]You know that.
[62:01.87]That was a tough one.
[62:02.53]It wasn't even tough.
[62:03.95]The cashier does that for you.
[62:05.15]None of you guys can just do that right now.
[62:06.51]Sean, you're just glowing today.
[62:08.53]Is there a new gal in your life?
[62:12.85]Then let's just go right to this week's ratings.
[62:16.50]What was that?
[62:18.50]What is that?
[62:21.88]That was a big cat puke.
[62:25.50]Stop pretending.
[62:26.62]I'm not.
[62:27.18]I'm just hanging out, man.
[62:30.82]That was a dog puke.
[62:31.66]Let's roll a clip from one of those shows.
[62:35.44]What's that smell?
[62:40.95]What's that smell?
[62:43.35]A shitty TV show.
[62:45.83]Remember, folks, Mr. Slokes is doing this in one whiff.
[62:50.43]You'll never get this one.
[62:51.56]I'm the champ.
[62:56.10]I'll get it.
[62:56.86]What, what, what, what?
[63:00.51]Oh, jeez, what is that stuff?
[63:03.66]That's disgusting.
[63:06.10]What, one more whip?
[63:07.50]No way, I'm not going near that jar again.
[63:10.82]Oh, Mr. Jones, it's your... Well, my sister worked in the hospital, and she stole a gangreneous toe.
[63:17.37]That means it was decomposing right on the person's body.
[63:23.07]They had to amputate this guy's toe, and my sister stole it.
[63:27.56]There's a lot wrong with what he was just talking about there.
[63:32.20]There's way too many things wrong with that.
[63:34.80]Okay, so you stole somebody's toe from a hospital.
[63:38.11]Okay, that's felony one.
[63:41.35]Then you put it into a jar.
[63:43.39]That's serial killer one.
[63:45.95]And then you made somebody smell it.
[63:48.65]That's both felony and serial killer combined at the same time.
[63:52.16]I just found out that the government is spending millions of dollars on a test to see if cows get lonely when they get lost from the herd.
[63:58.58]Isn't that ridiculous?
[64:00.12]What a waste of money.
[64:01.06]Of course they do.
[64:01.98]Who wouldn't?
[64:03.30]Anyway, we want to conduct our own tests, so we need to fly all around the country.
[64:06.94]We'll need maps, information about different cities, states, and a bunch of other junk.
[64:11.32]Now that's where you come in.
[64:12.56]Information is your middle name.
[64:13.96]No, I don't know these.
[64:15.46]I don't.
[64:15.78]Nobody does.
[64:16.30]People that pretend to.
[64:17.44]Use the A, B, or C button to select... I know where every major city is in the entire state of Delaware.
[64:23.93]I don't fucking have any idea.
[64:25.25]Which of the above states was the first to ratify the United States Constitution?
[64:28.87]I don't know.
[64:29.21]Delaware.
[64:36.62]Now that was a mystery to be solved.
[64:38.10]That's it.
[64:38.40]I said to get that right.
[64:39.56]I'm proud.
[64:42.28]Jeremy, you really don't know what the third capital of Delaware is?
[64:47.18]He didn't like it.
[64:52.26]He really didn't like it.
[64:54.10]He hated it.
[64:56.10]He doesn't like this week at all.
[65:09.05]Just me slapping myself.
[65:20.24]Missing socks.
[65:21.58]For years, people had their theories.
[65:23.52]Perhaps they were stuck to the wall of the washing machine or a dryer.
[65:26.50]Maybe you dropped one on your way to the laundromat.
[65:29.44]Or maybe there's a little man or woman possibly related to whoever turns the light off in the refrigerator when you close the door.
[65:36.29]And maybe that person likes to mess with our minds.
[65:38.97]Maybe they're taking socks one at a time just to screw us up.
[65:43.78]Or maybe we're not losing socks at all.
[65:46.80]That's some 500 IQ shit right there.
[65:48.04]Maybe we're just gaining them one at a time.
[66:07.73]I don't know why I just thought that headline was gonna say that they were fired for something.
[66:11.33]Like a scandal in kid TV.
[66:14.34]Person that put severed toe in jar somehow turned out to be a fucking criminal.
[66:20.38]Why so much?
[66:21.62]Do all animals need water?
[66:23.56]Why water?
[66:24.80]Why not grape juice?
[66:26.88]These are bonafide mysteries, my friend.
[66:29.26]I've said it a million times and I'll say it again.
[66:31.74]Research is everything on this show.
[66:34.18]Let's go do something.
[66:36.44]I'm ready.
[66:38.08]Use the joypad and the A button to select letters and unscramble the correct answer.
[66:43.60]Press B to erase.
[66:45.32]Okay, we have to unscramble a word.
[66:48.08]What is the angular distance measured in degrees east or west of the prime meridian called?
[66:55.27]Equator?
[66:58.75]The angular distance measured in degrees east or west.
[67:02.19]The... The... The...
[67:13.91]Long-de-tude.
[67:17.75]Long-de-tude.
[67:20.67]It's not long-de-tude.
[67:22.21]It's long-de-tude.
[67:23.11]I thought it was long-de-tude.
[67:24.83]I thought it was long-de-tude.
[67:27.89]Long-de-tude.
[67:28.95]Not long-de-tude.
[67:29.83]I thought it was long-de-tude.
[67:33.89]Long-de-tude.
[67:34.93]Not long-de-tude.
[67:37.51]Like, long.
[67:38.37]L-O-N-G-D-I.
[67:41.57]T-U-D-E.
[67:43.75]Longitude.
[67:45.25]Longitude.
[67:48.18]I'm still in first place.
[67:58.02]Good idea, John.
[67:59.37]Let's see a clip.
[68:04.12]I'm not pretending.
[68:05.16]I promise.
[68:06.08]I don't think I'm pretending.
[68:06.94]I thought it was longitude.
[68:15.83]Well, if it isn't Little Parsley Favors.
[68:18.21]Sure, whatever.
[68:19.13]You're a snake.
[68:20.55]Whatever do you mean?
[68:22.05]Betsy Skinner said she saw you and Nick at the movies last night.
[68:25.86]Your anger seems a little misdirected, Parsley.
[68:28.20]Perhaps it's yourself you should be scolding for not keeping him on a tighter leash.
[68:32.74]Just watch your back, Angelica du Jour.
[68:35.22]When you least expect it, I'm gonna... You'll do nothing.
[68:38.46]You are but a small speck of dandruff on my shoulder that I just flicked.
[68:41.94]Oh, you have dandruff?
[68:42.74]Disgusting.
[68:43.44]I'm going to spread that around the class as a rumor now.
[68:45.48]Oh, no, don't.
[68:45.74]I'm kidding.
[68:46.16]Terrific.
[68:46.50]Just terrific.
[68:46.94]Terrific.
[69:12.79]Somebody needs to prove the press releases that are going out.
[69:15.53]The press release gives the critics updated information about our show.
[69:19.31]Could you look them over and fix any words that don't belong?
[69:23.21]No, kid.
[69:26.07]All of the words on the screen are the same part of speech.
[69:29.29]Choose the word on the next screen that is that same part of speech.
[69:32.63]Roll nouns, okay?
[69:34.47]Alright, so I found a noun.
[69:36.49]Planet.
[69:38.93]Wind.
[69:48.30]Come on, kid.
[69:49.32]Learn from the best.
[69:50.06]Is this guy still picking his nose?
[69:51.18]It's still the nose picker?
[69:51.98]I missed the Star Wars game.
[70:15.68]We'll see it again.
[70:16.40]It's been an hour?
[70:24.89]Yeah, I'm still interested.
[70:26.75]I gotta get to the end.
[70:27.43]Every show on Nickelodeon now.
[70:45.05]Oh, say does that star spangled banner yet wave.
[70:55.50]Hey there.
[70:56.94]I was driving by and I couldn't help but notice your fabulous voice.
[71:00.02]Have you ever thought about playing Vegas?
[71:03.28]I'm a big agent.
[71:04.52]No, no, don't lump this guy in with Vegas.
[71:08.45]Really shitty security system around this place, by the way.
[71:11.55]There's a laugh track.
[71:13.24]There's a laugh track on this.
[71:14.82]This is horrible.
[71:15.20]This is like terrifying.
[71:33.81]Hey mom, can I go with a stranger?
[71:35.25]He's not going to take me in his car.
[71:38.22]Why are they laughing at this?
[71:40.00]This is fucking horrendous.
[71:52.22]In our show, the music is really important.
[71:54.72]It creates a mood and an atmosphere that is essential.
[71:58.19]We need to find more music.
[71:59.55]We've been using the same stuff for weeks.
[72:01.90]Would you mind going down to the music library and checking it out?
[72:04.90]Thanks.
[72:05.06]Alright, let's listen to some music.
[72:08.62]Use the joypad and the A button to select the three instruments playing the melody.
[72:13.10]Yeah, I can do this.
[72:17.09]That doesn't sound like any... So this is not just me going like... It's an oboe?
[72:21.77]I don't know.
[72:31.40]I don't... There's a piano.
[72:32.36]There's a French horn.
[72:32.88]Almost.
[72:33.06]What?
[72:33.16]You okay?
[72:34.60]Did this happen yesterday?
[72:35.78]Or like a couple years ago?
[72:55.20]They work all hours of day and night.
[72:57.40]And let me tell you, their work is paying off.
[73:00.55]These shows are great.
[73:01.99]Let's look at the ratings.
[73:05.89]I'm almost there.
[73:07.39]Week 9.
[73:07.57]Come on, get me to 100.
[73:09.80]Or 50.
[73:10.10]It's gonna be 50.
[73:11.70]What happened to the dog?
[73:15.36]I don't know.
[73:15.76]Yeah, where's the dog?
[73:20.61]Now my favorite segment, the clip.
[73:23.53]I love these shows.
[73:24.75]It's a dog.
[73:27.95]It's a dog.
[73:28.95]Alright.
[73:29.23]I mean, another weird, like, fitness thing.
[73:42.75]It's the intro again.
[74:07.98]Eventually, we raised enough money to do something real big.
[74:12.30]And we didn't like the old TV station that used to be here.
[74:15.61]So we took it over and made it our own.
[74:18.29]I think we did a good job.
[74:19.85]Don't you?
[74:21.53]Absolutely.
[74:22.15]I'm proud of the work we've done.
[74:24.43]Is there any message you would like to send out to kids with dreams of grandeur?
[74:28.24]Yes.
[74:29.18]I'd like kids to remember they can do anything they want if they just put their minds to it.
[74:33.44]Anything.
[74:34.42]If you could dream about it, you could do it.
[74:37.33]Good segment.
[74:38.73]Good segment, son.
[74:41.57]Superlative.
[74:44.03]Oh, thank God.
[74:44.85]There's John.
[74:47.93]He's fine.
[74:51.47]Sweeps week begins.
[74:52.61]What is sweep week?
[74:55.81]Uh-oh.
[74:57.13]Another adult got in.
[74:58.51]Uh-oh.
[75:05.48]Well, I had originally called you all here to tell you about Sweep Sweep, but it seems I have some other unfortunate news to announce.
[75:14.22]Dak Jones apparently has broken in and vandalized the station, stolen property from us, and generally wreaked havoc on Kid TV.
[75:22.90]So let's kick his ass.
[75:23.80]This is going to make your jobs a lot tougher in the next week.
[75:27.63]Everything you do will be worth triple the regular rating.
[75:30.81]And now, you will have more problems to contend with.
[75:34.27]Thanks to Dak, it will be one challenge after another, gang.
[75:38.45]But I know you're up to it.
[75:39.95]What, there's a guy just like hiding in the halls and shit?
[75:43.83]They can't get rid of this person?
[75:45.07]They can't get security or anything?
[75:46.43]I can't like... I don't understand.
[75:48.23]Why...
[75:50.33]Press the A button to stop the lights and choose your three challenges.
[75:54.43]Choose my three challenges?
[75:55.65]Oh, shit.
[75:57.03]It's like whammies.
[75:57.67]Oh, no.
[75:59.31]Take three, sound, and rewrite.
[76:02.02]Solve the three problems by using the joypad and the A button to select the correct dancers.
[76:07.24]That's 2, 4, 4, 35, 4, 50, 60, 70, 4, 65, no, 4, 70.
[76:08.82]1, 2, 2, 32, 60, 2, 60, 3, 60.
[76:09.00]Thank you.
[76:09.30]2, 25, 5, 2, 2, 25, 2, 4, 4, 25.
[76:09.53]That's 4, 50.
[76:31.26]Hey, you tried.
[76:32.34]You'll come back.
[76:35.88]Select each word requested by using the joypad and the A button.
[76:40.46]Alright.
[76:43.00]Pick an adjective.
[76:43.58]Adjective.
[76:44.40]Is sunny an adjective?
[76:47.26]Geek.

[77:10.43]Noun, noun, geek!
[77:11.99]Pick a noun.
[77:12.41]Geek!
[77:18.38]He actually doesn't.
[77:19.10]No, I do know!
[77:19.96]A geek is a fucking adjective.
[77:21.54]Isn't that, aren't you describing?
[77:23.50]Like, if you are a geek, isn't that like you're describing somebody as like a geek?
[77:30.51]I don't know what that is.
[77:31.25]I have no fucking idea.
[77:39.57]Bird?
[77:41.91]It's a piccolo.
[77:44.33]You have to put it in front of a noun, moron.
[77:48.00]Hey, hey!
[77:49.76]Hey.
[77:50.42]Geek.
[77:53.60]If somebody's a geek, you're describing them as a geek.
[77:57.22]Geek.
[78:00.70]Uh-oh.
[78:02.14]Is it the award show?
[78:03.12]Is there still a guy walking around the studio?
[78:05.32]Peaky would be the adjective.
[78:06.62]Yeah, I know.
[78:06.98]Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[78:27.67]This kid just dresses himself.
[78:28.77]Look at those shoes.
[78:29.73]Okay.
[78:55.21]I know we have some very nervous stars here tonight, waiting to see if their show will win this year's coveted Envy Award.
[79:02.23]Why am I not there?
[79:02.91]Hey, who took my coat?
[79:05.32]My mystery coat.
[79:08.42]It's the creep.
[79:10.24]Why does it fit him?
[79:13.34]Nice coat.
[79:15.90]We'll see what you think of old Dacky boy when he steals your little trophy.
[79:22.40]Smelly kids.
[79:23.98]That's what I do.
[79:28.12]It is my pleasure to present this to you if you want to.
[79:35.13]Hit him in the head with the trophy.
[79:36.59]Are you crazy?
[79:37.21]Give it to me.
[79:37.69]Bite him.
[79:38.07]What are you doing?
[79:38.85]This is mine.
[79:39.79]You lunatic.
[79:40.59]Give it to me, you big thing.
[79:42.09]Go bite him.
[79:42.87]This is mine.
[79:50.66]I got it.
[79:51.64]Nice job.
[79:52.40]Stage light falls and crushes his head.
[79:57.74]That's a little too far, but you know what I mean.
[80:17.90]thought that I would really have won this is the happiest moment of my life I'd like to thank everyone who made it possible especially my we won we did it keep watching kid TV everybody see you next season we did it we won well that was exciting wasn't it congratulations to the winners and congratulations to those that did not win this year that does it for this year's envy awards we will see you all next season
[80:47.68]That was great.
[80:48.72]Cool.
[80:52.20]What happened to the Vegas guy?
[80:54.82]He didn't show up and put on a weird overcoat?
[80:59.68]How did that guy steal that jacket?
[81:02.29]It was on the kid.
[81:06.11]I have a lot of strange questions here.
[81:10.83]He put the coat down next to him?
[81:12.25]How did he get it?
[81:13.73]It's freaking me out.
[81:27.82]I pray we never see anything like this again.
[81:31.30]I actually thoroughly enjoyed this one.
[81:33.20]I thought this was going to be an immediate next.
[81:36.20]I thought it was pretty good.
[81:37.10]Okay, alright.
[81:40.54]Want to speedrun one more?
[81:42.39]One more?
[81:42.71]Speedrun it?
[81:43.31]Do like a fast run?
[81:44.17]No!
[81:44.61]Okay.
[81:56.38]There were so many no's in less than a second that my chat, like, froze for a second.
[82:01.13]That was fucking hilarious.
[82:03.27]Alright, let's move on.
[82:04.53]I might come back to it, though.
[82:07.11]That was fucking fun.
[82:08.81]Wait, is there an after-credits sequence?
[82:10.33]There might be.
[82:16.09]Next up is going to be... Probably, like I said... There was a couple, two or three here today that were the reason why I bought this.
[82:26.05]This is the one.
[82:27.93]Waited a little while to do it.
[82:29.05]About to play.
[82:31.95]Exclusive to the Family Feud.
[82:33.90]Fucking just how did I?
[82:35.10]I just spoiled it.
[82:36.36]Exclusive to the 3DO.
[82:38.34]Family Feud FMV.
[82:43.96]How do I mess that up?
[82:45.95]This is a full FMV Family Feud 3DO game.
[82:51.35]Exclusive to the 3DO.
[82:54.40]I cannot fucking wait.
[82:58.78]Why don't we take this opportunity to take a small break.
[83:01.76]Let's go pee.
[83:02.62]I'll be back in about two minutes.
[86:47.43]Okay.
[86:48.73]I'm back.
[86:49.59]And I'm ready for Family Feud.
[86:50.77]Why are they saying cringe?
[86:57.04]Cringe, cringe.
[86:57.72]What is this for?
[87:05.12]I'm so looking forward to this.
[87:07.56]Remember the link, quick!
[87:09.69]Well, we do have a minute.
[87:10.35]Before I press play, what is it?
[87:20.30]Look, I cannot... Look, do you understand how much convincing it would take to let me be in a classroom and just disrupt the class?
[87:32.23]I would need to hire a bunch of people.
[87:33.95]It would have to be... I couldn't do it for real.
[87:35.63]It would be a total disruption.
[87:46.75]Actual stream.
[87:48.26]You clearly want to do it.
[87:49.84]Oh, sure, I think that would be really fun.
[87:53.00]If I spent a month straight in a fourth or fifth grade class, and I had to actually pay attention and take tests and shit, and see if I could get over an 80, I think that would be really fun.
[88:09.74]Like, I might ruin my entire Twitch career doing that, because if every stream was just me in a class, like a fourth grade class,
[88:17.75]Like, I could get, like, detention and stuff.
[88:19.45]It would be bizarre.
[88:26.79]It wouldn't be fun.
[88:29.45]That's why I'm not gonna do it.
[88:31.37]Alright, let's go.
[88:31.87]Here we go.
[88:34.09]Family feud coming up.
[88:44.18]Do that hamster stream.
[88:45.62]No, I can't.
[88:48.69]I can't do the hamster stream.
[88:53.60]Who's the host in this is what I want to know.
[88:57.56]I wonder if it's one of the actual TV show hosts.
[88:59.20]Because the whole thing is FMV.
[89:09.34]Game tech.
[89:16.35]Family Feud, fuck yeah, that's right.
[89:18.35]What about the Chocolate Factory stream?
[89:26.95]Just give me a minute.
[89:34.98]Let me just say quickly, thank you for the $50, FS Woods.
[89:39.04]5,000 bits, insane.
[89:43.55]Glad to see you back streaming.
[89:44.35]Was super happy to hear that Valve named the Scout after you.
[89:47.63]Can't think of anyone more deserving.
[89:49.07]Yeah, that's unbelievable that that was confirmed.
[89:50.89]I can't even fucking believe it.
[89:54.37]Family, thanks for the 50 bucks.
[89:55.71]That's a ton of money.
[89:56.39]That's too much money.
[89:57.59]Mole King also gave $50.
[89:58.71]I'm watching since my brother showed me your channel in middle school.
[90:03.07]Now I'm an adult and can pay you back for all the years of entertainment.
[90:06.83]You just being here is enough, man.
[90:07.85]Don't worry.
[90:08.19]That's a lot of money to give somebody.
[90:09.73]Thank you, though.
[90:13.24]I'm ready.
[90:15.42]Let's go!

[182:46.18]Yes, that's what we're looking for.
[182:48.36]What?
[182:51.08]White topping?
[182:52.46]What is white topping?
[182:56.42]Here comes the mayo.
[182:57.43]Yeah.
[183:01.83]That's like number one.
[183:02.57]That pisses me off that that's not number one.
[183:09.27]What's over salt?
[183:10.81]A white substance.
[183:13.31]Whipped cream.
[183:16.46]It's not whipped cream.
[183:18.06]Isn't it whipped cream?
[183:23.44]What?
[183:24.42]Sugar.
[183:33.62]Frosting.
[183:37.20]That only goes on, like, one thing.
[183:38.54]It just goes on a cake.
[183:43.35]Who ices their steak?
[183:46.17]It's not like a toaster strudel.
[183:51.67]Pass.
[183:52.27]Great.
[183:58.86]Why is it always my team that's doing the double pass bullshit?
[184:05.43]Get ready to steal.
[184:06.19]Is this a triple pass?
[184:12.36]Yes, it is.

[184:33.90]White sauce?

[184:44.93]Hey, what's something you put on your food?
[184:46.29]White sauce.
[184:48.14]A sauce that is white.
[184:51.18]Substance that is white.
[184:53.70]Yes.
[184:54.80]That is what I asked you to do.
[184:56.70]Whipped cream could be a white sauce.
[184:59.93]Mayonnaise could be a white sauce.
[185:01.13]That doesn't make any sense.

[192:48.29]No.
[192:49.25]How is a snake slimy?
[192:56.05]Maybe it's a little leathery.
[192:59.85]Smooth and leathery kind of, but slimy?
[193:05.91]That doesn't matter.
[193:07.61]We both didn't make any money.
[193:08.75]If we won, that's fine.
[193:09.47]Alright, four answers.
[193:11.26]Let's go.
[193:12.92]The top four answers are on the board.
[193:16.66]Name something that a motorcyclist wears.
[193:21.20]Yes, it is.
[193:22.84]Uh, like pads?

[193:57.31]Maybe.
[194:00.03]Maybe.
[194:00.57]I don't think so, though.
[194:03.04]And the survey said... I don't have to do better than that.
[194:11.67]Pass.
[194:15.07]Here comes the steal.

[194:46.89]Knee pads.
[194:48.41]What?
[194:52.03]They wear a jacket and gloves.
[194:56.79]Don't you wear, like, elbow pads, knee pads, shin pads, wrist guards when you're on a bike?
[195:03.69]I mean, no, that's... Okay, when you're, like, six years old, you wear all that stuff because you... Don't you wear that, though?

[195:28.57]The lettuce crisper.
[195:30.27]The crisper drawer?
[195:37.46]I don't know.
[195:37.78]They're just all the same thing.
[195:38.88]It's the thing that you just put food in there and it stays cold.
[195:41.46]I don't know.
[195:41.78]What do you mean compartment?
[195:43.64]Frid?
[195:44.02]The freezer?
[195:44.58]Frid?
[195:53.82]Shit.
[195:56.02]The cheese compartment?
[195:57.87]Who has a cheese... How big is your fridge?
[196:00.33]How big is your fridge that you have this food apartment complex where they apparently all have their own space and their own doors and shit?
[196:08.31]How big is this place?
[196:11.67]Cheese compartment?
[196:16.33]Uh, alright.
[196:16.92]The freezer.
[196:17.50]That's the easy one.
[196:29.65]What do you mean, nay?
[196:32.99]What?

[196:34.27]The cheese compartment?
[196:37.29]The meat compartment?
[196:38.49]Okay.
[196:38.73]I don't know about you guys, but when I put food in the fridge, I just put it in there.
[196:44.36]Yeah, you put, like, your meat on the bottom, in the draw, right?
[196:48.22]But, I don't know, you put everything else in there.
[196:49.64]You just put vegetables.
[196:50.34]Who cares?
[196:50.74]Just put it all in the fridge.
[196:51.44]It's all the same thing.
[196:58.40]Is it up there?
[196:58.96]The meat compartment.
[197:00.68]The cheese compartment.
[197:01.68]The condiments.
[197:05.72]The mustard compartment.
[197:06.98]The ketchup compartment.
[197:07.88]The condiments.
[197:08.40]Yeah, usually you put your condiments kind of off to the side a little.
[197:11.80]Yeah, condiments.
[197:18.84]Is it condiments or condiments?
[197:21.66]Condiment.
[197:24.46]Condiment.

[197:51.09]Vegetable compartment.
[197:55.45]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[197:58.35]That's probably one.
[197:59.21]This is number one.
[198:03.11]Not vegetables, not meat, not cheese.
[198:05.89]Not condiments.
[198:08.03]What else do you put in a fridge?
[198:11.09]Clothes?
[198:13.97]What else do you put in a fridge?
[198:15.31]Eggs?
[198:15.55]There's a compartment for eggs?
[198:23.87]Let's see what the survey said.
[198:25.45]It has an egg compartment.
[198:27.81]I'll just put them on the top and just slide them back.
[198:33.30]Egg compartment?
[198:36.76]A... Toppings?
[198:43.10]Drinks?
[198:45.32]Beverages.
[198:45.96]I'm saying drinks.
[198:48.30]I don't know anybody that does that.
[198:53.03]Drinks.
[199:00.68]No, but what's number one?
[199:02.28]Alcohol?
[199:02.76]Beer?
[199:05.62]Wine?
[199:06.04]No, but most people keep their alcohol not in the fridge.
[199:10.36]Fruit compartment.
[199:12.22]I said vegetables if fruit is up there.
[199:13.93]That's bullshit.
[199:14.35]You put them both in the same one.
[199:15.09]They're the same one.
[199:16.17]You guys won.
[199:17.03]That's unbelievable.
[199:17.49]Fucking fruit compartment.
[199:18.45]For what?
[199:26.61]The butter compartment and the ice compartment.
[199:29.03]The freezer is okay.
[199:30.23]We don't say freezer.
[199:32.39]Who keeps ice in their fridge?
[199:33.85]It just melts into water and it's going to ruin your fridge.
[199:36.34]Why would you put ice in the fridge?
[199:44.76]Was that a refrigerator or was that a cooler at a tailgate party?
[199:52.43]The top five answers are on the board.
[199:56.32]Tell me what you think the national speed limit should be.
[199:59.57]Wait, like, okay, 60.
[200:00.15]65.
[200:00.17]More than 100?
[200:00.47]What did the survey say?
[200:16.10]That's right, 65 is fine.
[200:17.64]Okay, let's take this one.
[200:21.30]Because I know that there's going to be a bunch of psychos out there that are like, it should be 80.
[200:24.34]Let's play it.
[200:26.74]I'm playing it, you guys aren't getting it.
[200:34.67]80.
[200:38.97]The national speed limit should be 80.
[200:41.51]Okay, is that a little high?
[200:44.43]75.
[200:44.69]70, 75 is definitely it.
[200:46.73]It's definitely 70.
[200:47.79]70 is probably number one.
[200:49.11]Or two.
[200:55.05]There it is.
[200:55.57]Alright, 70.
[200:56.97]60.
[200:59.03]In the 60s and 70s, it'll all be up there.
[201:04.25]We're going 60.
[201:08.49]55 is another one.
[201:10.89]Or potentially higher than 80, like 90.
[201:16.72]70, 60, 65, 75?
[201:18.68]Here come the fast speeds, right?
[201:20.06]I'm going to say 75.
[201:23.19]Or 55.
[201:23.89]We'll go low.
[201:30.13]55.
[201:31.69]Is it up there?
[201:32.99]It is.
[201:33.28]Okay.
[201:34.46]One person wants to go really fast.
[201:37.08]It's probably 85.
[201:47.59]85.
[201:47.73]That's so fast.
[201:50.87]Get ready to steal.
[201:51.65]That's ridiculous.
[201:53.49]Okay, was it 50?
[201:57.06]50 is too slow.
[201:58.24]50?
[201:58.88]It's definitely not 50.
[202:01.44]What?
[202:01.80]You could still win the game.
[202:12.63]You go faster than 85 or slower than 50.
[202:18.03]Yeah, pass.
[202:19.23]I win.
[202:20.49]Is it 90?
[202:21.23]It's going to be 90.
[202:29.07]Didn't I write 75?
[202:29.53]I thought I wrote 75.
[202:33.87]I was wrong.
[202:40.73]I didn't.
[202:41.75]Oh, shit.
[202:42.53]Whatever.
[202:42.85]Who won?
[202:47.90]Oh, I'm in the lead.
[202:50.32]Good luck.
[202:51.02]We asked 100 people.
[202:54.30]Name something everyone loses at some time besides hair and time.
[202:58.67]Shit, I don't know what the second one was.
[203:01.71]Besides hair and... What was it?
[203:04.40]Time?
[203:06.76]Besides hair and time.
[203:07.98]Okay.
[203:08.88]Wallet.
[203:21.48]What?
[203:24.78]Teeth?
[203:25.20]People are losing their teeth more than they're losing their wallets.
[203:32.37]How do you lose your teeth, by the way?
[203:33.73]I don't fucking understand that.
[203:35.29]I find that to be insane.
[203:38.53]Your teeth are in your mouth.
[203:41.01]And you need to eat with them.
[203:42.27]You need to be constantly aware of their presence.
[203:46.41]How are they coming out to enough times to lose them?
[203:51.49]Don't you just take your teeth out and put them in a glass next to your bed?
[203:53.83]Are you taking your teeth out and playing baseball with them and then they get lost in the stands?
[204:00.13]How do you lose your teeth?
[204:04.71]You play like basketball with them?
[204:08.93]Okay, something... It loses some time besides hair and temper.
[204:13.70]Teeth, not wallet, keys.
[204:21.81]Wait, didn't Winston Churchill used to take his teeth out and throw them across the Senate and stuff like that?
[204:25.54]Good answer.
[204:26.12]Maybe that's how.
[204:34.00]Okay, teeth.
[204:37.66]Probably watch, I would say, right?
[204:39.24]This is like back in the early 90s.
[204:40.96]Watch.

[219:57.06]That just felt pain.
[220:01.35]Now I get weapons.
[220:03.37]Holy shit, that was just air.
[220:04.95]That was huge air over that businessman.

[221:18.66]How did I do that?
[221:19.72]It's down.
[221:25.54]When does the race end?
[221:26.38]I'm going to lose.
[221:33.51]Kick is OP.
[221:33.99]Alright.
[221:34.89]Good to know.
[221:41.30]Alright, here we go.
[221:42.36]I got time.
[221:44.02]Just don't even focus on hitting anybody.
[221:47.76]Don't you get a weapon eventually?
[221:48.72]Like a baseball bat or something?
[221:49.78]Or like a chain or something?
[221:56.03]Wow, that was a lot of people there.
[221:57.39]Okay, I just kicked that guy off the map.

[223:35.25]Super bikes.
[223:35.87]Alright, rat bikes.
[223:36.77]These are way too expensive.
[223:41.35]These are $3,000.
[223:41.95]I don't have even close to enough money.
[223:45.52]Alright, uh, this freak.
[223:46.44]Get out of here.
[223:46.98]Sports bikes.
[223:47.58]I don't have enough money.
[223:50.71]Alright, back into the bar.
[223:54.74]Moose.
[223:56.88]I think it's the exact same.
[224:01.06]It's the same thing.
[224:02.46]Alright, the street.
[224:05.20]Nothing else I can do.
[224:05.92]Alright, bulletin board.
[224:11.15]Sierra, Nevada.
[224:12.67]Thunder through what's left of the great northwestern timberland into the Napa Valley.
[224:19.66]Avoid tourists.
[224:23.42]Blast through the traffic-congested suburban wasteland.
[224:25.76]Face dead man curves and sheer cliff walls.
[224:32.64]Oh, yes, we will.
[224:35.88]Tourists.
[224:36.62]Tourists.

[224:49.62]What am I supposed to be looking at here?
[225:01.93]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[225:07.54]What?
[225:07.80]That's supposed, that's me?
[225:10.76]I mean, that's the exact clothes that I wear and it's kind of the same hair color, I guess.
[225:22.63]That's the only resemblance.
[225:25.00]Alright, let's go.
[225:28.82]Go!
[225:29.10]I don't even know why I ran that guy over.
[225:34.03]That was uncalled for.
[225:50.01]It's so hard to do this.
[225:51.51]It's so hard to get somebody like that.
[225:57.39]I can't even hurt him.
[225:58.05]Come on, hurry up.
[226:12.64]God damn it.
[226:13.49]Whatever.
[226:15.69]I got plenty of time.
[226:26.49]No, Rhonda.
[226:29.89]Just run the whole race.
[226:31.35]Why would I torture you guys like that?
[226:32.71]It would be torture.
[226:43.30]Alright, here we go.
[226:48.93]That was tight.
[226:59.68]Okay, am I crazy or do you get like a bat and like a whip and stuff?
[227:09.69]Yeah, you do.
[227:10.31]Okay, yeah.
[227:10.69]I'm just checking.
[227:14.31]I gotta get in first place for that.
[227:19.61]It's the other game.
[227:21.06]Oh.
[227:32.08]Shit.
[227:33.46]So focused on hurting people that I can't even drive.
[227:48.63]Come on.
[227:49.21]Fuck you, dude.
[227:52.80]It's the barefoot bandit.
[227:54.04]Yeah, it kind of is, isn't it?
[228:02.98]That's a good pass right there.
[228:07.38]Should I do enough to at least buy a new bike?
[228:09.26]I should have it.
[228:09.94]If I get in first place, I'll have it.
[228:20.43]Yeah.
[228:22.31]Second place.
[228:23.70]First place.
[228:25.28]I just... Wait!
[228:36.10]How did I get in first place?
[228:36.92]Was I supposed to go right?
[228:38.30]Did I miss the shortcut?
[228:45.73]Are you sure?
[228:46.17]Or did I accidentally do the shortcut?
[228:47.75]I'm in first place.
[228:50.13]It's so quiet.
[228:50.79]It's like eerie.
[229:12.16]My brain is telling me that the game crashed because of the audio.
[229:15.56]But I know it didn't.
[229:16.36]First place?
[229:27.57]Alright, make way for the champion.
[229:34.25]Oh.
[229:42.13]Uh... What the fuck was that?
[229:52.89]What the fuck?
[229:54.23]Run to the rash finished in first place.
[229:57.77]I got another thousand bucks.
[229:58.77]Alright, so now I have enough for a bike.
[230:01.63]I'm sorry, I just punched you.
[230:02.63]No, I don't.

[230:15.25]What about a super bike?
[230:18.55]No, these are... This is like you're going to play the game for more than 40 hours.
[230:21.47]No.
[230:26.11]Trade in?
[230:29.27]I can trade in my bike?
[230:33.65]What do I have?
[230:36.12]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.

[230:46.18]How about this one?
[230:48.69]250 CC.
[230:49.79]The thing that no one ever picked in Mario Kart because it was way too hard.
[230:53.25]50 or 100 CC only.
[230:56.45]The game became fucking impossible after 100 CC.
[231:00.35]What was I saying?
[231:07.03]How about the Killer Rat?
[231:07.85]How much is that one?
[231:08.45]I don't have enough.
[231:09.33]I'm going to do the... I'm going to do the Kamikaze.
[231:14.56]Let's go.
[231:16.10]Looks pretty good.
[231:30.03]This little two-stroker has smoked some bigger bikes in this time.
[231:33.29]Now it just smokes.
[231:35.43]Handling crisp.
[231:36.91]Moderate acceleration.
[231:38.01]Substandard top speed.
[231:41.45]This thing sucks.
[231:44.17]How much is a... What about like a super bike or a sports bike?
[231:50.52]Oh, these are all way too expensive.
[231:52.50]It's worse than what I have?
[231:53.78]Sports bike.
[231:57.14]13 grand.
[231:57.60]11 grand.
[231:58.92]No, I have to buy one of the shitty ones.
[232:02.85]Yeah, I gotta buy one of the shitty rat ones.
[232:07.23]Corsair bike.
[232:09.67]Alright, what about the Corsair bike?
[232:20.96]RGB bike.

[233:21.76]Fix the mic delay?
[233:23.66]Has there been a mic delay?
[233:25.62]Shouldn't be.
[233:35.59]There is a delay.
[233:38.33]How bad is it?
[233:39.87]It's a very slight delay.
[233:44.13]You said there was a delay.
[233:45.71]Yeah, but I compensated for it by making my microphone 1000 milliseconds slower.
[233:53.20]I'm seeing your moves before you do them.
[234:08.87]Nope, one of us got hit by that car.
[234:10.17]That's fucking ridiculous.
[234:11.23]No way.
[234:11.67]Somebody had to get hit by that thing.
[234:12.81]What do you mean the bike sucks?
[234:18.54]Look at the handling.
[234:27.61]The funniest part about this is it really had a mature audience warning.
[234:33.35]I really think they do this in Mario Kart now.
[234:46.56]This game reminds me of what you hear when you get a concussion.
[234:53.13]It's true!
[235:22.01]That was some wacky racer shit right there Can I pass this guy?
[235:41.92]I need to get into first place Hit with the car
[235:53.40]I can't unhear that now.
[235:55.88]What happens when you get a concussion?
[235:58.34]I feel it and I hate it that I feel it.
[236:06.10]What?
[236:07.44]How did you not fall off?
[236:21.02]Yes, I have been concussed before.
[236:32.67]I need to pass him.
[236:33.77]I don't want to be in second place.
[236:45.06]Did I tell you the story about me and my brother when we were playing like... Hold on.
[236:50.55]Sorry.
[236:51.17]I don't know if I was trying to avoid that person or trying to hit them on purpose.
[236:53.71]I don't know.
[236:56.14]I fell off the side of my bed when I was a little kid.
[236:59.02]When I was, like, probably, I don't know, 10?
[237:01.85]12?
[237:02.47]I hit my head on the back, on the front of a fireplace.
[237:04.93]And I had to get, like, six staples in the back of my head.
[237:13.35]Oh, yeah, that's, oh, yeah.
[237:17.27]That's real.
[237:24.39]Here we go again.
[237:26.29]Here I am.
[237:28.45]Here's my trophy.
[237:29.47]Alright, I think we've seen all we need to see from Road Rash.
[237:51.05]Important look.
[237:53.62]Important, important, important, important.
[237:55.03]Hold on.
[238:00.95]Right, yeah, now this is what I'm talking about.
[238:02.33]This is just a daily occurrence on this stream.
[238:17.94]A thousand dollars each.
[238:23.40]Coming up next, we are going to put in... I have no idea what this one is.
[238:31.51]I think it's in Japanese, I think.
[238:45.20]No, there's another Japanese game.
[238:46.76]Yeah, there's another Japanese game there.
[238:50.12]Not this one.
[238:56.00]This is called Guardian War.
[238:59.02]For use with the 3DO systems.
[239:04.21]I don't know.
[239:04.57]That's like a bunch of animals with like swords and shit.
[239:07.11]I don't know.
[239:10.79]It could be pretty pog.
[239:11.65]I don't know.
[239:23.57]I believe this also is an exclusive.
[239:25.69]Never heard of this before anywhere else.
[239:38.60]Guardian.
[239:39.28]This could be an RTS for all I know.
[239:46.80]Let's go.
[239:55.96]This is an RTS.
[239:59.70]Is it, though?
[240:00.16]How would you do an RTS with just a gamepad and three buttons?
[240:05.12]I guess you could.
[240:06.35]They did it on PlayStation 1, right?
[240:12.51]Guardian War.
[240:13.19]1994.
[240:15.33]Micro Cabin Corp.
[240:15.83]1994.
[240:15.87]First start?
[240:16.57]Oh, okay.
[240:29.18]Another world, another time.
[240:41.83]The world was filled with light, and all kinds of creatures and plants dwelled in it.
[240:47.43]But... The powers of darkness that take over the world appeared there.
[240:56.11]They called these powers Asgaiya.
[240:58.86]Can't follow any of this.
[241:01.59]The ground was torn apart.
[241:03.83]Ordinary plants took on grotesque forms, and everything lost its vital energy.
[241:10.53]The powers of darkness deprived the world of its soul and alternate.
[241:14.76]They created millions of dreadful monsters.
[241:20.00]Finally, the goddess Hera, the ruler of the world, has suffered this critical situation, but everything seems hopeless.
[241:29.21]However, she summoned up her greatest strength to try to defeat the darkness that had overtaken the world.
[241:36.07]Her only defense was courage, hope, and love.
[241:43.22]They kind of just, they feel like they don't belong in the same universe, right?
[241:48.46]Like, this would be us?
[241:58.24]Guardian War.
[241:59.28]Okay.
[242:04.18]Wait, it's one word.
[242:05.32]Guardian War.
[242:07.89]Damn, okay.
[242:12.79]How do you play?
[242:18.31]New game.
[242:18.79]This ain't gonna be like a 150 hour long RPG, is it?
[242:25.00]Arise.
[242:26.32]This world is at the point of great crisis.
[242:30.08]Okay.
[242:32.82]Give me energy.
[242:33.50]Give me life.
[242:35.50]This one might actually be pretty good.
[242:37.74]We might have a gem here.
[242:50.55]It took a very long time.
[242:52.48]Gollum, guardians of powers kingdom, use my strength.
[242:57.52]Okay.
[242:57.86]Your peaceful followers sleeping in their shrines all over the world have been prevented from waking.
[243:04.66]Threaded war?
[243:05.42]Awaken them and help crush the evil Azrael.
[243:13.31]I don't like this.
[243:13.97]I don't like that.
[243:15.29]I hope that's not the whole game.
[243:16.33]It's a cringe war.
[243:23.50]Okay, go to the northern shrine and release your friends from the dark powers.
[243:27.04]At least it's got the DOOM OST.
[243:29.98]Uh, I get- This is just a really, really zoomed in, shitty iPad mobile game over world map.
[243:39.83]Oh no.
[243:41.77]We have to get three stars on this level.
[243:47.54]Is this an action game?
[243:55.74]Wait, this is another party member.
[243:58.77]Blinks the Cat.
[244:01.95]By the way, Blinks the Cat will be played shortly here in the next probably few weeks.
[244:06.69]If you would like to watch that.
[244:12.84]Okay, cool.
[244:15.72]So we have two party members.
[244:22.07]These characters look kind of cool.
[244:23.23]They really do.
[244:26.89]The reason why the quality just dropped?
[244:30.19]Wait, so she was talking to us in person.
[244:32.13]Now she's talking to us on a phone.
[244:40.41]Alright, battle time.
[244:46.97]It's Wiimote's speaker.
[244:53.52]It really was.
[244:54.98]There are 16 enemies.
[244:55.96]Defeat them all.
[244:59.82]It's like an old, old school RPG, huh?
[245:05.31]How do I swing?
[245:16.21]Don't run away!
[245:20.80]Oh, wait a minute.
[245:21.28]Okay, so it's... Night.
[245:23.21]Go... Slash.
[245:31.79]It's like a grid-based RPG.
[245:34.95]Finished moving?
[245:36.01]No.
[245:48.75]Alright, Holy Light healing.
[245:50.03]Holy Light.
[245:50.87]No, don't do anything.
[245:53.41]Does Holy Light do damage?
[245:58.19]Fire Emblem.
[245:59.05]No, just don't do anything.
[246:05.82]GoldenEye music.
[246:07.96]Yeah, it is.
[246:12.98]Alright, Slash again.
[246:18.80]What was... What's going on?
[246:21.28]Am I not close enough?
[246:23.76]Slash.
[246:24.82]There we are.
[246:26.16]Okay.
[246:26.38]Slash him.
[246:26.80]Okay, you can be... No, he's still alive.
[246:35.65]Should I heal myself?
[246:37.11]I need... No.
[246:37.69]Priest doesn't do anything.
[246:40.47]Alright, priest, just sit there.
[246:42.15]Do nothing.
[246:43.40]Okay.
[246:48.73]Holy Light?
[246:49.35]I don't think Holy Light does damage.
[246:54.23]The audio is definitely ahead.
[246:58.07]Alright, you're telling me, right?
[247:02.37]Okay, I'm ready.
[247:02.93]I'm gonna pick... I can't really do it now.
[247:08.84]So, I'm gonna veto this one.
[247:10.18]I don't know, it's like, wait, we'll give it a chance.
[247:12.48]Hold on now.
[247:13.64]I have to kill 16 of these guys.
[247:15.38]And this is how long it's taken to kill 2.
[247:24.29]Alright, fine, fine.
[247:25.05]No, I won't.
[247:25.61]Fine.
[247:25.99]I know you like the little Eric Cartman guy.
[247:27.93]I know.
[247:28.33]I get it.
[247:29.61]Holy light.
[247:38.04]Back it up.
[247:42.86]Let's see it.
[247:45.68]Nice.
[247:50.43]Does it heal?
[247:51.05]Does it heal the enemy?
[247:56.51]Oh shit!
[247:58.01]We win!
[248:02.17]Alright, let's go look at the map.
[248:03.49]We're gonna go up and left.
[248:06.19]What's that?
[248:11.95]Oh wait, diamonds.
[248:12.77]Nope, never mind.
[248:15.82]That's the starting zone.
[248:20.02]This actually is pretty- No, it is cool.
[248:21.66]It's cool, it is.
[248:23.14]There's 16 people here.
[248:24.28]This is a tiny map.
[248:36.93]Whoa!
[248:41.53]Oh shit, already doing Fang?
[248:42.83]40 out of 40?
[248:46.10]Alright, 40 HP.
[248:46.74]Is this Newgrounds flashbacks?
[248:52.36]Yeah, it kinda does have that vibe, doesn't it?
[248:53.70]I gotta heal the, uh, main character here.
[249:05.57]And Pumpkin Knight is level 2 now.
[249:09.27]Oh, shit, cool.
[249:10.41]Should I do Holy Light?
[249:15.82]Yeah.
[249:17.02]You have to protect the protagonist.
[249:36.07]I could see myself being 13, 14 years old and just being on Newgrounds and beating this whole game five times.
[249:41.81]There's a bear back there?
[249:44.97]It's a Banjo-Kazooie character.
[249:48.67]Alright, I gotta heal this guy.
[249:52.00]Alright, you do heal.
[250:00.30]Healing.
[250:02.08]There we go.
[250:08.14]Good effects, too, for a game made in, like, 1993.
[250:14.48]Something to remember, this is also back when Super Nintendo was still the most popular console, wasn't it?
[250:20.76]Back in, like, 94?
[250:21.29]So this is alright.
[250:24.85]This ain't bad.
[250:25.43]Hurry up and veto.
[250:31.31]Hold on, let's see what the next character is, and then I'll veto.
[250:41.46]It's very cute.
[250:42.12]Yeah, this is a nice game.
[250:45.46]I give this one a solid 14-year-old Jeremy playthrough five times out of ten.
[250:51.01]Alright, this looks like an encounter.
[250:59.65]Wait, what are they doing back there?
[251:05.09]Stay here?
[251:05.47]Alright, I think this guy's hard.
[251:14.28]Defend?
[251:15.34]Is he gonna walk over here?
[251:20.60]Oh shit, he is walking over here.
[251:21.68]Okay.
[251:24.52]Flash.
[251:31.08]What is that?
[251:32.38]Like a bear or... Crash Bandicoot or something?
[251:37.01]I don't know.
[251:38.79]Fully light.
[251:40.23]Here is a companion.
[251:40.95]You can't stop here.
[251:41.91]Oh.
[251:48.16]Kobold.
[251:48.78]Oh, there we go.
[251:49.28]That's what it is.
[251:59.95]Foxy from Five Nights at Freddy's.
[252:04.99]Oh, he's faster now.
[252:06.09]He's shimmying a little more.
[252:11.64]There's chests over here.
[252:14.08]I gotta open up at least one of these chests.
[252:20.29]Oh, I got 63.
[252:21.09]I'm okay.
[252:29.62]Pumpkin basic level is now 2.
[252:31.42]Let's just clean this up.
[252:35.38]Holy Light.
[252:35.90]I was going to get addicted to this.
[252:44.79]No, no, I will not.
[252:47.04]I just want to see the at least first level.
[252:49.26]Maybe the next party member.
[252:51.94]Alright, chests.
[252:54.92]Let's see what they are.
[252:55.86]Open them.
[252:58.62]What's in it?
[253:00.26]Is it different weapons?
[253:02.42]And a stone.
[253:03.34]Oh, that's cool.
[253:04.00]Probably have to grind.
[253:08.04]I'm sure you do.
[253:15.82]What's in this one?
[253:22.83]I got three enemies.
[253:31.47]Let them come to me.
[253:33.17]That's good.
[253:33.89]That's fine.
[253:35.71]This one's dead right off the bat.
[253:40.80]The disk just made a really awful noise in there.
[253:43.92]That was not a good sound.
[253:44.80]I don't know if my noise gate might not have picked that up.
[253:47.00]That was a crunch.
[253:48.98]It just went... Remember the last time?
[253:57.95]Remember I told you?
[254:01.27]The 3DO gets really hot and maybe it's mechanically breaking?
[254:05.10]I don't know.
[254:06.75]How long has the stream been?
[254:07.39]Four and a half hours?
[254:08.69]It's alright.
[254:09.11]We're okay.
[254:09.61]How hot is it?
[254:12.07]It's a little hot.
[254:12.55]It's a little warm.
[254:15.19]You're smelting the disk.
[254:23.25]It's alright.
[254:23.61]We got... What's after this?
[254:25.51]Let me see.
[254:31.28]Psychic Detective is gonna probably be a whole stream.
[254:33.76]I need to be honest with you.
[254:36.40]You guys remember Wirehead?
[254:38.31]I'm getting lots of Wirehead vibes from Psychic Detective.
[254:41.69]That's probably going to have to be an entire stream.
[254:50.68]I'm saving some of these ones.
[254:53.20]We'll go through some of the fun ones, DeVito, and just play for like 30 minutes, 40 minutes.
[254:57.74]But there are some that are going to be probably at least 4 or 5 hours.
[255:01.54]This guy's going to die.
[255:04.69]Wait, what happens if he dies?
[255:09.17]You okay?
[255:12.19]He buys you 45 health now.
[255:13.19]I didn't lose.
[255:21.34]How many more people do I need to kill for this?
[255:23.00]Did I do it?
[255:26.86]No, this is just the boss zone.
[255:28.51]Alright, I need to heal.
[255:41.57]It's a missing texture?
[255:42.51]I don't think it's a missing texture.
[255:49.69]Don't lose all your bad.
[255:51.91]That's okay.
[255:53.73]I'm not concerned about that.
[256:02.76]What?
[256:03.06]You worms dare oppose our Lord Azrael?
[256:06.50]Alright then, die!
[256:11.44]music changed.
[256:16.08]Why do we get a music change?
[256:18.74]Okay, I gotta heal him.
[256:26.85]Four?
[256:27.29]That's it?
[256:39.29]The soundtrack's pretty good, yeah, it is.
[256:42.44]These defense panels?
[256:48.20]Maybe they are.
[256:51.25]Well, that hurt.
[256:54.99]Alright, well, now he's off that panel.
[256:58.61]Let's see if we can get him.
[257:08.68]15.
[257:08.76]Yeah, that was a little better.
[257:09.76]I really like this guy.
[257:22.36]You got a new soundtrack you can play?
[257:25.60]It's true.
[257:36.41]He's focusing the healer.
[257:37.49]That's smart.
[257:39.29]Not gonna do you any good, though.
[257:41.83]Holy Light might affect multiple targets if it's lined up.
[257:45.92]Maybe.
[257:53.36]This is cool.
[257:54.72]This actually is pretty cool.
[257:56.02]What did IGN give this?
[258:06.29]52 damage.
[258:06.71]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[258:07.73]Are we surprised if IGN reviewed this game?
[258:15.73]7.8 out of 10.
[258:16.37]That's not bad.
[258:20.41]That's not bad.
[258:25.82]wait oh this is the this must be the boss there's a ton of health alright uh I gotta heal myself look up the metacritic scores
[258:51.99]You just said I'm going to veto this game.
[258:54.29]I know, I know.
[258:55.07]But I just want to get at least past the first level or two.
[258:57.21]I don't believe this.
[259:04.60]Defeated all the enemies nearby.
[259:06.16]Okay, let's go.
[259:15.60]Done.
[259:17.82]You win.
[259:23.82]Is Bugleberry talking?
[259:28.97]He was just talking.
[259:29.67]Okay, well.
[259:37.21]Do I have to go there?
[259:38.72]I guess this is the next spot.
[259:47.41]Land of East Canal.
[259:48.91]There are 17 enemies.
[259:50.05]Defeat them all.
[259:50.77]Alright.
[259:52.40]This is a fun game.
[259:53.30]This is a cute game, but... We've got a lot of 3DO games to get through.
[260:00.02]It's cool, though.
[260:00.72]I like it.
[260:01.06]Let me just try to see if I can get Holy Light on more than one person.
[260:03.73]You know what I mean?
[260:06.39]Like, I have to figure that out first.
[260:07.71]I know.
[260:08.15]Just wait.
[260:08.85]I vetoed it already.
[260:20.10]It's Vito.
[260:20.52]Trust me.
[260:20.84]I just want to see if I can holy light on one person in a line.
[260:23.94]Like, you know, two people.
[260:26.16]Holy light.
[260:27.05]See if we can get both these people.
[260:30.51]No, they're not lined up.
[260:35.11]It's just right there.
[260:35.78]Alright, that was cool.
[260:36.88]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[260:43.76]It's a fun game.
[260:44.44]The game's cool.
[260:45.24]That was Guardian War.
[260:47.47]I highly recommend it if you want to have a bag of Cheetos after school and play for a couple hours a day.
[260:55.76]That's what I would do.
[260:57.68]Alright, let's put in probably one of the last one or two of the night.
[261:00.98]At least for today.
[261:04.40]We'll do probably a couple more.
[261:06.83]I gotta pee again.
[261:10.08]I'm peeing on the hour almost every hour.
[261:12.86]Give me a break.
[261:14.58]It's been exactly every hour and 30 minutes, hasn't it?
[261:18.86]It has been.
[261:21.62]First time I went pee was an hour and 30.
[261:23.14]Second time was three hours, and now it's four hours and 30 minutes.
[261:26.78]I'm on a schedule, apparently.
[261:28.98]I'll be right back.
[264:06.32]Okay, this next one is probably the one that I'm most interested in.
[264:12.14]Not because I think the game's going to be any good, or because the game's going to be fun to play, or there'll be something interesting, but just because this is one of the most expensive 3DO games.
[264:23.95]This game is called Captain Quasar.
[264:27.34]It's made by Studio 3DO, and it was the most expensive game.
[264:32.12]I don't know why.
[264:39.70]Break it.
[264:41.04]All the expensive ones we smash over our heads.
[264:44.34]How much was it?
[264:45.06]I don't want to say.
[264:45.54]I don't want to say because it's embarrassing.
[264:49.66]But, hey, remember, I own it forever, and it's mine forever, and I have it, and it'll be worth probably three grand in five years.
[264:56.52]No, it was not more... Okay, it was not more than $100, okay?
[264:59.70]I promise.
[265:01.76]Captain Quasar.
[265:06.34]That's not Captain Quasar.
[265:12.42]That's Captain Quasar, apparently.
[265:14.20]This game's worth more than $200.
[265:20.01]The universe was once a lovely place to live.
[265:26.41]Broad smiles beamed from every planet in the Milky Way.
[265:29.86]Law-abiding galactic citizens thrived under the happy twinkling stars, and goodwill flowed from one end of the cosmos to the other.
[265:37.92]But then things changed.
[265:42.94]Are you hearing my voice first?
[265:43.88]We shit dude.
[265:44.56]Relax?
[265:44.98]Oh my goodness.
[266:12.22]Here he comes.
[266:16.53]Captain Quasar.
[266:19.14]Oh, an elf on his way, man, is sick.
[266:52.18]I think he should be on SpongeBob.
[266:53.74]I hope there's a musical interlude before every level, that would be awesome.
[267:28.00]Watch this be a fucking card game.
[267:29.75]Not disappointing, right?
[267:44.71]That's a clap from me there.
[267:45.79]That was awesome.
[267:48.70]Captain Quasar.
[267:50.38]Previews.
[267:50.78]Let's see.
[267:52.12]Always watch previews first before the movie.
[267:54.44]Hope it's the same basketball game.
[267:59.57]It's a basketball game.
[268:00.27]Battle sport?
[268:00.81]Do I have this?
[268:27.33]Holy shit, I don't think I have Battle Support.
[268:29.92]I might.
[268:48.86]Wait, you actually play ball?
[268:53.16]Rocket League, but... Don't say that.
[268:56.76]Don't say that.
[268:58.30]Is this like Rocket League?
[269:08.44]It is Rocket League, but there's no weapons in Rocket League.
[269:15.63]There's no missiles.
[269:22.22]That looks fun.
[269:32.33]Remind me to go over my collection of like 30 games that are still left over here and look for Battlesport.
[269:38.93]It might be in there.
[269:39.51]I don't know.
[269:43.14]Okay, Captain Quasar.
[269:44.42]New game.
[269:45.04]Let's go.
[269:49.72]Yes, more cinematics.
[269:51.08]My favorite.
[269:54.74]Get in here, Quasar.
[269:56.22]Sit anywhere.
[269:57.12]Quasar, I have a tough assignment for you direct from Intergalactic Headquarters.
[270:02.13]I'll give it to you straight.
[270:05.46]A dastardly crime syndicate is intent on conquering the galaxy.
[270:09.24]Leading this space riffraff is a butt-ugly strongman named Ox, who's determined to take over one planet at a time.
[270:16.53]Aiding Ox are two other hoods.
[270:18.39]Dubah, a renegade synthetic who threatens to addict the galaxy to a heinous spice he's manufacturing.
[270:24.39]And Zhang, the head of an intergalactic terrorist ring.
[270:27.96]You, Quasar, are our last chance for stopping them.
[270:31.12]Your first mission will be to defeat Duba on his homeworld of Krag, a dry desert planet in the Oinks sector of Galadriel.
[270:38.62]The ground ship is all fueled up and ready to go, and you can purchase equipment and supplies from the police armory if you've got the cash.
[270:45.26]Now get out of here, and don't let me down.
[270:57.41]whoa now those are look at those things he dive into his ship I hope he does and I hope he gets stuck I knew it yes I love that trope from every cartoon
[271:28.67]What's he doing in there?
[271:31.27]This guy just drives around the world and just giggles?
[271:59.70]Oh, no, he's like me
[272:29.72]Here we go.
[272:30.10]Huh?
[272:30.20]I destroyed the spice factory.
[273:02.13]This is a creepypasta game.
[273:05.07]Fuck, I stopped laughing.
[273:09.29]Don't be this character.
[273:10.35]These are good loading screens.
[273:20.85]It's a fun game anyways, it looks cool.
[273:25.06]Oh, okay.
[273:28.20]Wow.
[273:29.82]I got missiles.
[273:30.52]I got grenades.
[273:33.28]Holy shit, this game might be the best one.
[273:40.91]It's like Pondra.
[273:42.07]Aren't we supposed to be on this alien planet?
[273:46.51]Where's our spacesuit?
[273:48.99]What?
[273:49.39]What are you...
[274:04.94]No, don't!
[274:05.48]Wait, this actual destruction?
[274:09.29]Holy shit.
[274:09.83]Okay, cool.
[274:10.29]Hold on.
[274:10.51]I just hurt myself.
[274:16.95]Watch out.
[274:26.80]Please.
[274:27.24]Can I pick?
[274:27.84]Oh, wait.
[274:28.06]Ammo, ammo.

[274:34.57]This is so loud.
[274:36.57]Okay, let me help you there.
[274:40.51]Go help.
[274:40.81]I wonder if this is probably bosses.
[274:49.02]What's that?
[274:54.36]Is this crack?
[274:58.42]Okay, I mean.
[274:59.24]Wait, don't let it fly.
[274:59.94]Don't let it fly.
[275:00.44]Get it.
[275:03.75]Is it destroyed?
[275:09.05]I think so!
[275:09.67]Yeah, this music is giving me anxiety.
[275:28.22]So?

[276:21.60]I'm out of ammo for everything.

[276:30.91]What do I do now?
[276:35.41]Wait, can I get in the water?

[278:57.82]Pretty good.
[279:05.86]Oh.
[279:08.00]I can't kill him.
[279:08.92]That's... Alright.
[279:14.90]Good thing I didn't.
[279:16.73]Enemy interrogation.
[279:18.97]A teleporter will take you to a secret storage outpost.
[279:21.75]Use the password BBAAAABB.
[279:25.31]BBAAAABB.
[279:27.47]Forget it, what is it?
[279:32.84]BBAAAABB.
[279:34.60]Nice.
[279:37.42]Alright, now I come and steal whatever it is I'm stealing?
[279:42.12]I don't even know what I'm doing here.
[279:49.86]What's the point of that?
[279:57.80]How do I get back?
[280:03.27]Oh.
[280:06.21]Can I not go through this?
[280:10.37]Why?
[280:10.69]I guess I can.
[280:12.39]Just blow it up.
[280:24.17]This is penis music.
[280:27.95]Wait, wait, no, no, no.
[280:28.57]Okay, what is it?
[280:30.39]Oh, mighty quasar, do not overlook the splendor of the surrounding desert.
[280:35.63]It is not as bare as it may seem.
[280:49.21]It's a Riddler.
[281:00.62]What is the objective though?
[281:02.12]What am I supposed to do?
[281:03.47]I'm almost dead again.
[281:05.81]I'm gonna die.
[281:16.11]I'm dead.
[281:16.31]I have one more, two more health.
[281:21.62]You can upgrade your weapons.
[281:28.10]Holy shit, that guy blew up.
[281:36.36]Alright, I've robbed the bank.
[281:37.36]I gotta get down here.
[281:40.25]These are the silos, right?
[281:41.65]He took off.
[281:42.05]Fuck.
[281:42.15]Alright, how do I leave?
[281:57.37]How much more of this shit is there to do?
[282:03.80]Did I get power up?
[282:05.48]Oh, nice.
[282:06.74]28.
[282:12.29]I can't lose!
[282:14.71]There's no losing in Captain Quasar.
[282:29.57]Shit, someone got away.
[282:30.37]Alright, double power-up?
[282:37.35]Why am I dying so fast?
[282:48.89]This is not really space music to me.
[283:03.68]There's only so much I can destroy silos.
[283:06.66]How do I leave?
[283:07.32]I want to end the mission.
[283:10.26]I think I did enough.
[283:12.77]I did enough.
[283:13.27]How come you get to choose what space sounds like?
[283:27.53]I don't know.
[283:28.21]Why do you get to choose what it doesn't sound like?
[283:44.08]Shit.
[283:47.34]I'm getting more silos.
[283:50.18]I don't want to do any more silos, dude.
[283:53.17]It's endless.
[283:55.79]Don't shoot me.
[283:56.33]I'm just a cadet.
[283:58.15]My name is Dumb Star Head.
[284:02.23]I'm cadet.
[284:02.77]My serial number is Baba Abba.
[284:07.00]No, that's not it.
[284:07.84]Hey, I never got a serial number.
[284:09.52]So, Baba Abba.
[284:16.12]I'm going to go on that teleporter.
[284:24.54]Oh, it's different.
[284:24.96]This is like a spreader.
[284:30.08]Come on.
[284:30.52]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[284:34.86]Alright.
[284:35.36]Baba Abba.
[284:41.52]Oh, Baba, Baba Yaga.
[284:49.90]Oh, I'm surrounded.
[285:03.65]Here it comes.
[285:04.75]Here comes the best part, right?
[285:20.99]What is the objective?
[285:28.73]This is stupid.
[285:42.15]There is no objective.
[285:43.45]There has to be an objective.
[285:47.16]Don't worry, I never wanted to be a criminal.
[285:48.72]I thought I signed up for a bellhop position on Pleasure Planet.
[286:05.33]Power-ups?
[286:07.77]I'm invisible and I have super speed.
[286:09.45]This isn't- this is not fair!
[286:23.55]If you insist on attacking, I'll have you know that this boot camp doesn't fall easily.
[286:34.60]Okay, goodbye.
[286:37.40]This is $200 down the toilet.
[286:40.76]No, it's... This wasn't $200.
[286:43.22]We need to get that clear.
[286:57.30]This is the same room.
[286:58.46]I'm just firing machine guns.
[287:06.50]Destroy it!
[287:07.02]I don't know.
[287:13.03]I think I'm gonna puke.
[287:15.97]Is anybody else getting sick?
[287:18.45]It just hit me right now.
[287:19.82]It just hit me like a ton of bricks.
[287:20.92]It just smashed into me.
[287:31.34]Shit, I'm gonna be sick.
[287:32.34]I'm gonna be sick.
[287:32.94]I'm gonna be sick.
[287:33.56]I'm gonna be sick.
[287:34.40]I have to stop.
[287:36.32]I'm gonna be sick.
[287:37.46]Uh-oh.
[287:44.70]Okay.
[287:46.72]Alright, I stopped that.
[287:52.49]That was Captain Quasar.
[287:53.27]That was pretty fun.
[287:54.58]I mean, I don't know.
[287:56.58]Not very fun.
[287:57.18]It was stupid.
[287:58.60]But, I mean, it's expensive.
[288:00.32]So, I mean, that means something, right?
[288:08.66]Here come the bars.
[288:10.86]We're going to do one more.
[288:12.16]The last one we're going to do is... What the fuck?
[288:21.31]This scared the absolute hell out of me.
[288:22.87]Alright, here come the bars.
[288:28.93]You know what?
[288:29.43]I'll put this up.
[288:32.09]So I don't hurt anybody's eyes.
[288:33.80]Alright, give me a sec.
[288:35.54]The last one we're going to play for today.
[288:38.02]What do we got?
[288:42.86]We got... The Ode.
[288:53.31]P.O.'d.

[290:16.72]A really crappy day.
[290:17.48]It just seemed like a sweet deal back at base.
[290:20.06]Imitate an ice cube for three months.
[290:22.25]Feed some dumb mercs for two weeks.
[290:24.25]And then three more months in the fridge on the ride home.
[290:27.61]Two weeks of work for six months of pay.
[290:29.93]Not bad.
[290:30.47]Not bad at all.
[290:31.13]Well, the cook is always the last to know what the hell is going on.
[290:34.08]Is this like a riddle of what food am I?
[290:36.50]I never would have taken this if I knew it was going to be a bug hunt.
[290:41.52]Love, Ox.
[291:11.39]AI dungeon.
[291:16.53]That's good.
[291:19.06]Okay, here we go.
[291:21.54]Is that a jump?
[291:23.50]I have a frying pan?
[291:24.92]It's an actual frying pan.
[291:28.82]What's the top left supposed to indicate?
[291:30.64]Is that my health?
[291:34.32]What is the feet?
[291:35.58]What's the feet for?
[291:40.44]How do I get over this?
[291:44.74]There's a feet cam?
[291:46.57]Why?
[291:57.18]Or I can kill him!
[292:07.37]Why is that?
[292:08.03]I don't know why.
[292:08.70]Whose feet are those?
[292:09.60]Are those my feet?
[292:10.74]I don't get it.
[292:11.22]Alright, I'm going to go this way.
[292:21.68]Did I jump too far?
[292:22.70]Okay, down.
[292:28.34]Something behind me.
[292:46.49]I got stuffed under something I can't just die in the first room Okay, I made it Going up Can I get a gun?
[293:17.77]Okay, what's this?
[293:19.13]Log in.
[293:19.63]Okay, I can't log in.
[293:23.13]I have no login.

[293:27.38]Okay, in here?
[293:27.80]New weapon?
[293:33.88]No, it's just health.
[293:38.41]Only pan and feet cam.
[293:46.53]Nice.
[293:51.58]Am I okay?
[293:57.52]The lower health that I get, do I get like a doom when my feet get more crusty or what?
[294:03.18]No, what's the indicator up there?
[294:04.52]What does that mean?
[294:14.65]Do I get dirty bare feet for the more health I lose?
[294:21.42]Let me try this again.
[294:22.12]I just put it on easy.
[294:27.56]Let's just go down.
[294:31.12]It's your feet level.
[294:39.25]Somebody's got the speedrun on this.
[294:40.51]I'm sure it's insane.
[294:43.48]Switch to the feet weapon.
[294:44.86]I only have a frying pan.
[294:45.94]I don't have anything else.
[295:02.39]And only, so far.
[295:03.85]Forget Dru-Crew, it's time for Feet-Fleet.
[295:16.17]Alright, don't fuck this up, just go here.
[295:18.71]I'm gonna go across.
[295:21.03]Does this hurt?
[295:21.47]It's not- I wanna get at least one new weapon.
[295:44.75]Feet, fleet, feet, fleet.
[295:46.05]Now, none of you guys actually want to see this game played.
[295:50.48]You guys are painfully typing that and then just rolling back in your seat going, ugh.
[296:05.89]Can somebody just look up, PO'd, what does the feet meter do?
[296:11.48]It has to be a reason for its existence.
[296:13.38]It doesn't just exist for no reason.
[296:15.20]I see a weapon over there.
[296:15.90]That looks like a weapon, right?
[296:27.11]Oh, shit.
[296:27.55]What is it then?
[296:29.11]Oh, get me out of here.
[296:29.95]Get me out.
[296:30.35]Get me the fuck out.
[296:31.13]Get me out.
[296:31.75]Just get me out.
[296:36.28]I don't want this on my history.
[296:38.96]It's on, no, it's on my history.
[296:40.80]And did I fall through?
[296:41.58]Oh my, I want to go up.
[296:52.40]What the fuck just happened?
[296:58.42]Why did it go up?
[296:59.38]I can't ride it up?
[297:11.40]You're being crushed.
[297:14.70]I don't think I can take it anymore.
[297:15.92]I think I have to stop.
[297:17.19]I can't take it anymore.
[297:18.63]I can't do it anymore.
[297:19.25]It's freaking me out.
[297:19.91]This is fucking me up.
[297:26.33]I can't.
[297:27.03]Captain Quasar made me physically ill.
[297:29.03]And now I don't know what to do.
[297:41.85]What?
[297:42.31]This is your basic travel mode.
[297:43.70]You can change your foot speed between normal and turbo.
[297:47.82]Press X. What?
[297:50.86]What?
[297:51.06]Is this just a put shoes on button?
[297:59.81]That made it so much worse.
[298:01.09]That made it worse.
[298:01.69]I want the bare feet again.
[298:02.69]I'll throw up.
[298:03.38]Wait, new weapon.
[298:05.14]How do I change that?
[298:12.80]What's throwing?
[298:22.06]Nice, okay.
[298:23.28]What is this fucking game?
[298:24.42]I don't know, man.
[298:26.00]Something that's about to get vetoed in exactly 30 seconds.
[298:28.26]Those aren't even running shoes either.
[298:44.48]Go up.
[298:45.78]What the fuck?
[298:47.64]Get up there.
[298:48.38]Fucking Captain Quasar.

[299:14.02]I have to veto the whole stream, actually.
[299:16.66]I gotta get up.
[299:17.32]I'm gonna puke.
[299:18.60]I'm not even kidding, either.
[299:19.66]That's the worst part.
[299:21.86]We made it to five hours.
[299:22.76]We're good.
[299:25.24]That was, uh, bare feet video game.
[299:30.64]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[299:33.12]Tomorrow, I don't know if we're gonna do 3DO.
[299:36.04]We might need a 3DO break stream tomorrow.
[299:40.20]do something else or we might just start one of the long form 3DO games so tomorrow we're not going to blow through like six seven plus games on this radio if I play it again we're gonna do like psychic detective or we'll do something else I will see you guys tomorrow thanks for watching thanks for sticking around as always uh thanks for the like 800 subs it's been an absolute insane amount
[300:09.59]Oh, FTK, right.
[300:10.59]I want to tell you, FTK is happening on October 3rd.
[300:14.73]That is the new date for FTK.
[300:17.81]Saturday the 3rd, in the afternoon, I believe, starting at 3 p.m.
[300:22.18]Pacific time.
[300:25.16]It is not happening next weekend or this weekend.
[300:29.28]I wasn't exactly sure the moment I was going to come back, so I just decided, look, let's just push it out so I know that I'll be back, right?
[300:38.32]So October 3rd is a new date.
[300:40.30]That's when everybody can kind of reconvene and do it all over again.
[300:45.48]And I will see you guys tomorrow.
[300:49.84]But let's show the credits because it's probably going to be insane.
[300:52.57]Because there were like 6,000 community subs earlier.
[300:57.19]Look for Battlesport.
[300:58.03]That's right, I will.
[301:01.67]Let's go over there.
[301:03.85]Here they come.

[301:13.84]Thanks to all the community subs.
[301:15.04]It's been a lot.
[301:16.64]I think I missed a lot of subs.
[301:19.94]It was just coming in so hot that I couldn't even catch them.
[301:24.64]Thank you, everybody.
[301:28.57]You continue to give this stream insane amounts of money.
[301:33.85]I hope it's worth it.
[301:34.41]Thank you.
[301:35.81]Turbo credits.
[301:36.47]That's right.
[301:39.72]Yeah, well, maybe we'll switch away from 3DO tomorrow.
[301:43.44]There's so much I have for it.
[301:44.86]I'd rather... Let's spread it out a little over the next couple of weeks.
[301:47.08]What do you say?
[301:49.30]Seems like a good idea to me.
[302:00.89]Saw, saw, saw.
