[01:08.11]Hi.
[01:09.59]Hey.
[01:11.79]How are you guys?
[01:13.99]You know me.
[01:15.85]You've seen me before in front of a video camera.
[01:20.69]It's me, Jeremy.
[01:21.71]Your best friend.
[01:23.89]Haven't seen you in a while.
[01:28.82]Boy, you find yourself unable to cast sus.
[01:31.12]Stream is live.
[01:31.76]That's a good one.
[01:32.22]I like that one.
[01:35.47]We're not going to need to do a frog stream.
[01:40.39]Sniper Elite is pretty much downloaded.
[01:42.33]Just needed a few more minutes.
[01:47.43]But thank you for the three months there, buddy.
[01:50.89]Back on track to a regular stream schedule.
[01:53.33]I'm talking about the days.
[01:54.17]I'm talking about days.
[01:57.43]I've got to get something real clear.
[01:59.17]Hold on, let me tweet that the stream is going on.
[02:05.68]And tweet.
[02:08.74]Okay.
[02:09.84]So I'm going to make something real clear.
[02:12.44]Once people trickle in, we'll talk about this.
[02:14.15]I've got to make sure I make this very clear.
[02:18.39]Is this some kind of planetarium stream?
[02:26.70]Happy Valentine's Day.
[02:27.70]Hey, thanks.
[02:28.60]Hope you guys had a good Valentine's Day.
[02:31.78]If you didn't, then who cares?
[02:33.38]It was just February 14th.
[02:34.90]Not a big deal.
[02:39.48]I thought you were... Jerma985, the hip college professor?
[02:45.18]What?
[02:48.07]Alright, so, hold on.
[02:51.13]Let me get... Get, get, get, get, get, get, get, get.
[02:57.03]Am I the human they call Jerma985?
[02:58.69]I am that human.
[03:01.06]I go by many different names and titles.
[03:05.32]But that one has stuck.
[03:06.89]That one has stuck.
[03:08.79]But thanks a lot, LucasFan, two months.
[03:11.19]Do you remember what took you so long?
[03:13.23]You want us to fire you or something?
[03:16.19]Well, I can't get fired.
[03:18.83]Where am I going to go?
[03:21.80]Who's going to fire me?
[03:23.76]My boss over here?
[03:25.46]He will, so don't fucking... Please don't fuck this up for me.
[03:28.60]Wait, what?
[03:30.15]Thank you for the subs, though.
[03:33.47]Alright.
[03:35.59]For the time being... I still need to wait another minute or two.
[03:39.48]Let's just do this.
[03:41.76]I'm at 95% downloaded on Sniper Elite because the game is like 6,000 gigs.
[03:47.70]Whoa!
[03:49.66]Whoa!
[03:52.32]Somebody just gave me $50.
[03:53.10]Nairome.
[03:53.38]Nairoame.
[03:54.59]Nairome.
[03:55.01]What's Nairome?
[03:56.39]Nairome.
[03:59.91]But I thank you, Nairo.
[04:01.57]For the $50 they say.
[04:02.95]Hi, Kevin.
[04:04.93]Well, hey, Kev.
[04:07.56]I don't know if he's talking to you, Kevin.
[04:09.24]If there's a Kevin in this phone call right now.
[04:11.74]What's going on, Kevin?
[04:14.66]Thanks a lot, dude.
[04:15.24]$50.
[04:15.36]That's fucking incredibly generous of you.
[04:16.98]$50 from Nairo.
[04:23.43]And now we're just on a black screen.
[04:24.61]Hold on.
[04:27.65]Starting soon.
[04:30.58]Oh, God!
[04:33.86]What the fuck?
[04:36.54]Alright, we got another $50 from FatBatman122.
[04:41.28]And they say, A, laughing my ass off.
[04:48.21]Well, special shout out to Kevin.
[04:50.65]And, uh... Well, not Kevin.
[04:52.53]To... Well, shout out to Kevin.
[04:55.57]By Nairo for the 50 bucks.
[04:56.85]And Fat Batman for the 50 bucks as well.
[04:59.34]Spoiling me already.
[05:00.40]We haven't even started the stream.
[05:01.32]Thanks a lot, guys.
[05:02.14]You guys rock.
[05:03.98]And also, thank you to... Congenital Heart Defect.
[05:07.98]That's a pretty morbid name.
[05:10.19]But thank you for the sub.
[05:11.07]And Purple Smart for three months.
[05:13.03]Mikey Lobster Benji Menji for 11 months.
[05:15.27]I Hirono for 12 months.
[05:18.34]Angry Probed Droid LucasFan Comrade Bandit And this is where we are going to talk about this Because now that I have you here I want to go over this and I want to see what you guys have to say about this Because it is fairly important But first of all Mitchell gave 10 bucks Thanks a lot dude Thanks for the 10 bucks Now I get to watch you play the first mission that I was in the middle of Enjoy Cyber Elite 4 Well that would be fun
[05:45.80]But I'm going to address this right now.
[05:47.14]It's something that it's been sort of bothering me in a way.
[05:53.08]And we're going to cut this video because this is a goofy, funny video.
[05:56.48]So we're just going to put up a picture of like a fucking dog or something.
[06:01.89]Can I get like a picture of a dog somewhere?
[06:04.17]Yeah.
[06:04.37]Alright.
[06:05.75]Let me just get a picture of a dog.
[06:09.75]I'm just typing in dog photo into Google.
[06:12.39]There we go.
[06:12.69]There we go.
[06:15.01]Okay.
[06:15.29]Viewer.
[06:18.44]Get this.
[06:18.80]Get this.
[06:21.14]Okay.
[06:23.50]Save that.
[06:26.80]And hold on.
[06:28.74]Add image.
[06:29.12]It's going to take a picture.
[06:31.89]Get this fucking dog picture right here.
[06:33.35]There it is.
[06:34.69]Okay.
[06:36.33]So...
[06:40.38]While I'm talking, just focus on this dog's ballsack turkey neck.
[06:44.76]And the fact that it's a Great Dane.
[06:47.84]It's a Great Dane.
[06:48.64]It's a Great Dog.
[06:49.82]One of my favorite dogs.
[06:50.78]The Great Dane.
[06:54.19]Let's talk about subscription alerts.
[06:56.95]And subs.
[06:58.17]And bits.
[06:59.19]And stuff like that.
[07:00.87]Because I feel like...
[07:03.68]I've been uh sort of neglecting them and I feel like it's been something that has been starting to get worse and worse over the course of the last like three days or so or four days uh four three four streams let's put it that way um it's very difficult for me at the point at the moment because I have such a scatterbrain and I'm such a one track person when I'm when I'm streaming
[07:28.00]That keeping up with the new subs and resubs has started to become sort of difficult for me to do.
[07:36.21]And I don't like that feeling.
[07:38.75]I don't like not being able to tell people that I'm happy that they're around and thank people for subbing.
[07:46.58]And it can go to a point where I get really focused on the game or I get really into something that's happening and I miss like 20 subscriptions.
[07:54.03]You know?
[07:55.53]I'm having a crossroads with myself stream-wise because I'm not sure if I want to keep them on because I'm just not seeing them and I'm not talking about them.
[08:09.28]And I don't want anyone ever to feel like, oh, fuck, he didn't read my subscription.
[08:13.76]He fucking must not like me.
[08:16.44]He read three other people's before me, but not me.
[08:19.91]I don't want you to feel like that.
[08:21.55]And like, it's getting to a point where I'm getting a lot of resubs and a lot of subs now.
[08:27.73]Like at this moment, after like six to seven months of streaming, that I don't really want, because there are some people that see that as a detriment to the stream, you know?
[08:40.16]Like subscription alerts happening every 12 seconds or like every two minutes or something can, I guess, bother people, you know?
[08:49.67]But on the other hand, like I like people being able to see and like people being able to know what's going on.
[08:57.10]Again, I think maybe what I would do is I'm trying to figure out a solution.
[09:03.10]And I'm thinking maybe maybe there's something I could do like when the stream is over or
[09:11.97]at like certain points in the middle of the stream or something.
[09:14.59]I don't know.
[09:15.93]Because I don't run ads.
[09:17.71]There are like at least a handful of opportunities where I, hold on, I gotta change this text too.
[09:25.36]So let's talk.
[09:27.68]There, let's talk.
[09:31.50]It's so small in the corner.
[09:33.55]Yeah, let's talk.
[09:39.42]but there you go.
[09:39.98]So it's, I don't want people to feel like that.
[09:42.96]I don't care.
[09:45.10]Over the course of the last, uh, like for instance, I just heard the notification.
[09:48.38]I, I've no, I don't know who it was.
[09:50.70]And like, I did that will happen.
[09:52.68]Like over the course of a whole stream, I'll miss like maybe 30 fucking resubscriptions potentially.
[09:59.94]And it's just, it seems like a lot more people are resubscribing recently.
[10:03.91]Cause obviously over the course of the last year,
[10:06.76]We've gone from, you know, like, 20 subs to 100 subs.
[10:10.90]Like, 500 subs.
[10:12.12]And, like, over the course of a long time, those resubs happen all the time now, you know?
[10:17.22]Just because of how long I've been streaming and how many people are subscribed to the channel.
[10:21.30]And I never want to, like, lie to you guys.
[10:22.62]I never want to make that sound like, well, you know, I don't have that many subs, so I'll keep subbing, you know?
[10:26.52]You know, I only have, like, 5,000 subs.
[10:27.70]No, like, by the way, I don't have 5,000 subs.
[10:29.36]But you know what I mean, though.
[10:30.69]Yeah.
[10:41.83]I'm not sure.
[10:43.23]And I don't want to do text-to-speech either.
[10:44.51]Because text-to-speech, in my opinion, just kind of... Just, like, kind of ruins the stream.
[10:52.43]And my streams are more about, I think, like, what's going on and, like, what we're doing and if I'm playing with friends.
[11:00.02]It's not so much about, like, hearing somebody say a sentence in my ear, you know?
[11:08.16]But...
[11:12.33]Yo, Jeremy, I served you a... I served you a... Oh, wow!
[11:16.17]What's going on, Nibs?
[11:18.70]Thanks for the three months, dude.
[11:20.20]Hey, speaking of subs, thanks for the three months, man.
[11:25.80]Me and Kim went to a restaurant, and he was the dude that was there serving.
[11:31.97]It was cool to meet you, dude.
[11:35.39]But yeah, the sub and resub sounds, they'll change over time.
[11:40.19]But I just needed to, like, get this off my chest in a way.
[11:43.98]Because I don't really know how to address it yet.
[11:46.82]But I'm going to address it.
[11:51.57]I think maybe certain milestones or new subs versus at the end of the stream or maybe... I don't know.
[11:59.58]I'll figure it out.
[12:00.28]But I just want to let you know that I am thinking about it.
[12:04.12]And it's not something that I'm just brushing under the rug.
[12:06.64]Oh, God.
[12:11.27]And all the while, somebody... For instance, Fat Batman gave 1,500 bits.
[12:17.51]A little while ago.
[12:18.59]Thanks, Fat Batman.
[12:19.31]Thanks for the $15.
[12:19.81]And then Baked Flakes just gave $5.50.
[12:23.78]Saying, hi, Kevin.
[12:26.14]Who is Kevin?
[12:28.20]What is this Kevin thing?
[12:31.48]Is there a Kevin that I don't know?
[12:33.87]I have no idea who the fuck Kevin is.
[12:36.85]But hi, Kevin.
[12:37.45]Thanks, Baked.
[12:38.39]For the $50.
[12:38.83]But let's go.
[12:43.09]I'm going to open up Sniper Elite.
[12:46.68]I would highly suggest you guys mute for like 10 seconds when I open this, because it's probably going to be a thousand, 10,000 decibels in your ear.
[12:58.15]So I'm warning you right now, I would just lower the volume a little bit, because it's going to be loud.
[13:02.79]It's going to be loud in about five seconds.
[13:04.91]And I can do what I can here on my end.
[13:06.41]I hope it doesn't do it, but here we go.
[13:07.71]I'm opening it.
[13:09.39]So good luck, because here it comes.
[13:16.69]Kevin is better than Jeremy.
[13:18.41]I don't know who Kevin is.
[13:25.26]Turning it up.
[13:27.96]But long story short, to give like a cap what I was trying to say is I'm probably going to do something with my sub notifications.
[13:39.47]Because bit notifications, like bits, they don't happen as often.
[13:44.32]And I say that, I'm saying that right now.
[13:47.52]And it's not, like, alright.
[13:50.82]You know, bits don't happen as often.
[13:53.10]Here's 50 fucking dollars.
[13:56.63]Thank you, Nairo.
[13:58.05]I feel for you, Kevin.
[13:59.03]I feel you, Kevin.
[13:59.85]I don't know who Kevin is, but thanks, Kevin.
[14:04.01]And thank you for the 50 bucks, Nairo.
[14:08.22]And can this game... Stay on medium.
[14:11.90]Take off motion blur.
[14:14.54]Whatever.
[14:15.14]This thing's fine.
[14:16.06]V-sync.
[14:16.52]No V-sync.
[14:19.18]Run game.
[14:21.98]That's fine.
[14:22.76]1920 by 1080.
[14:28.29]Should I run it in a window?
[14:29.09]Yeah.
[14:30.51]Alright.
[14:31.15]Cover your ears.
[14:32.45]Here it comes.
[14:35.75]Cover your ears.
[14:40.51]Here it comes.
[14:43.53]Told you.
[14:44.47]I told you.
[14:48.27]Told you.
[14:48.61]And let's do that.
[14:55.30]Hold on.
[14:55.64]Let me add this.
[14:56.50]Hopefully this works.
[14:57.98]For some reason, recently, I don't know why.
[15:01.42]But games have... Ah, there we go.
[15:03.12]Thank God.
[15:05.75]No, we're not talking anymore.
[15:06.77]No more talking.
[15:07.93]No more dog either.
[15:13.21]Okay.
[15:14.71]Oh, Jesus Christ!
[15:18.60]Wait, wait.
[15:19.44]What?
[15:19.72]Oh, it's alright.
[15:21.12]It's okay.
[15:21.92]Just pay attention to the dog.
[15:23.90]When the dog is on screen, we don't get that loud noise.
[15:31.07]Okay.
[15:32.27]What?
[15:33.17]Here it comes again.
[15:35.13]Cover your ears.
[15:35.71]Here it comes.
[15:44.97]Give me the audio.
[15:45.97]Audio.
[15:48.14]Give me the audio.
[15:49.72]Fred?
[15:49.98]Who the fuck is Fred?
[15:50.92]Kill camera?
[15:52.30]Sure.
[15:54.50]Ah.
[15:55.52]Oh, God.
[16:00.66]Jeez, man.
[16:03.18]Why do they have to make these games so fucking loud?
[16:07.42]I've never understood that.
[16:10.48]In my, like, 200 years playing video games.
[16:19.74]Okay, cutscene subtitles, subtitles, sure.
[16:22.95]Display, yeah.
[16:25.45]Yeah.
[16:27.27]Yeah.
[16:29.21]Yeah.
[16:29.59]Alright.
[16:34.33]How we doing?
[16:38.99]Kevin says hi.
[16:39.71]Well, thank you, Fat Batman.
[16:42.45]Is this multiplayer in this game?
[16:46.78]Alright, well.
[16:47.90]Ladies and gentlemen.
[16:49.44]Thank you for listening to me talk for 20 minutes.
[16:54.08]But we're gonna go.
[16:56.22]And again, thank you to everybody that's subbing and everything.
[16:58.10]It's something that I'm... I'm starting to try to figure out what to do about it.
[17:04.75]New campaign.
[17:07.43]Cadet.
[17:09.09]Marksman.
[17:10.05]Sniper Elite.
[17:11.31]Authentic.
[17:13.77]I feel like we have to be the baby here.
[17:15.31]We're just gonna do normal.
[17:19.61]Yeah, we're just gonna do Marksman.
[17:20.63]We're just gonna do normal.
[17:21.73]Nothing crazy.
[17:22.37]This used to be a Kevin stream.
[17:29.88]Kevin stream.
[17:30.56]Alright.
[17:35.68]Is it loadout?
[17:36.28]No.
[17:37.50]This is DLC.
[17:41.25]Five dollars.
[17:45.77]Welcome to Sniper Elite.
[17:47.45]Where we have the most advanced technology.
[17:51.68]Some of the best weapons.
[17:52.66]Some of the most iconic weapons.
[17:55.14]Five bucks.
[17:57.48]Less than a BB gun at the grocery store.
[18:01.86]Why is the grass freaking the fuck out?
[18:09.50]Alright, let's go.
[18:16.68]Select it.
[18:17.18]That's what I want.
[18:17.64]I want this one.
[18:21.26]Mad kid stick grenades.
[18:22.08]Those are fine.
[18:22.80]Whatever.
[18:24.24]Let's blow some people's fucking faces off.
[18:27.04]That's what you do in this game?
[18:27.82]I have no idea.
[18:31.79]A little BB gun.
[18:33.35]It's a little BB gun.
[18:36.37]You can't buy... You can't even hear this.
[18:38.03]Just turn it up.
[18:44.81]We closed the trap on Hitler's North Africa campaign.
[18:49.30]But what next?
[18:51.58]Churchill urged an allied invasion of Italy.
[18:55.68]Called the Mediterranean the soft underbelly of the crocodile.
[19:02.01]The Americans took some convincing, but Winston won them over.
[19:06.59]Oh, Winston!
[19:07.68]I know Overwatch.
[19:09.27]General Dwight D. Eisenhower, Allied Commander in Chief, is masterminding the entire Mediterranean strategy.
[19:16.49]I don't care about this cutscene.
[19:20.98]Neither do I. Don't worry.
[19:23.92]You can't say next?
[19:26.74]Next?
[19:30.02]They didn't even draw the title screen yet.
[19:32.76]See?
[19:39.74]We've been losing ships in the area.
[19:42.35]British intelligence thinks the Luftwaffe's presence on Sanzalini might explain why.
[19:48.43]The Royal Navy dispatched a captured Italian freighter.
[19:51.21]Which?
[19:51.53]What?
[19:52.75]She was equipped with the very latest... Why does it keep turning off?
[20:02.41]Who's turning it off?
[20:03.18]Stop turning it off on me.
[20:06.16]Survivors from the... Don't talk.
[20:10.54]I'm trying to, like, get to my other monitor.
[20:15.69]Come on.
[20:16.15]Oh, what the fuck?
[20:18.19]Hold on.
[20:18.59]You're, like, opening a new window.
[20:25.29]Yeah, we gotta find out what the Germans are up to, apparently.
[20:30.19]Alright.
[20:32.21]What's he doing?
[20:32.57]Did the guy just fall out of the boat?
[20:33.59]Come on.
[20:33.87]Oh, what the fuck?
[20:36.63]The guy just, like, fell out of the boat.
[20:37.91]Hold on.
[20:40.96]Okay, now I'm good.
[20:43.30]Now we need to know what the Nazis are planning and how we can stop them.
[20:49.41]A member of the Luftwaffe's top brass is on the island.
[20:52.85]General Tobias Schmidt.
[20:54.93]It's no secret Hitler thinks highly of him.
[20:56.99]Why are these... What's going on?
[20:59.93]The graphics are freaking... Why are the graphics freaking out?
[21:01.62]Schmidt would never let himself be taken alive.
[21:04.20]And he'd never betray his beloved Fuhrer.
[21:07.50]But he might just be carrying some information we can use.
[21:11.51]Alright.
[21:11.81]I'm ready.
[21:12.97]I'm prepared for this shit.
[21:14.62]Alright, there we go.
[21:15.54]Sniper Elite.
[21:17.36]The title of the game is Sniper Elite, right?
[21:22.72]Sniper Elite 4.
[21:27.60]Wait, what?
[21:41.74]Why is the foliage just freaking out?
[21:43.14]Alright, I'm ready.
[21:46.10]This has got to... Wow, that's got to go way down.
[21:50.02]Sensitivity needs to go, like, way the fuck down.
[21:58.01]Vibration, no.
[21:59.25]Okay, is that better?
[22:02.73]That's better.
[22:04.35]Alright, Sniper Elite.
[22:06.20]The fourth version.
[22:11.33]Reckon I could take this fellow down without making a noise.
[22:17.56]Wait.
[22:22.16]Why did he just do an x-ray of the guy?
[22:24.18]I reckon I could do an x-ray on this guy's chest and see if he has any problems with his heart.
[22:34.71]Alright, well.
[22:36.95]Binoculars.
[22:38.19]Easy enough.
[22:43.47]Tag the enemies.
[22:46.33]I can't really move around with this.
[22:51.12]My range of motion is so small.
[22:52.42]Look it.
[22:52.80]I can go this far.
[22:54.74]Just because I have binoculars on my face means I can't move my head more than like eight degrees up or down.
[23:00.46]No, no, no.
[23:00.90]I can't do that.
[23:01.46]I can't move left or right with these binoculars on.
[23:03.96]They're too heavy.
[23:07.00]But I do have superhuman tagging strength.
[23:17.81]okay now take out your sniper rifle and shoot these guys hold q select the rifle okay and you apparently I can't move alright holding my breath will steady my shot hold space to empty your lungs well I can how many
[23:45.50]Alright.
[23:46.78]Shoot the big red crystal.
[23:56.96]That was so elaborate.
[23:57.98]That didn't need to happen.
[24:02.41]Oh, you get like all the ghosts.
[24:04.07]That's cool.
[24:04.61]You get like every single little achievement.
[24:08.87]Jump the gap.
[24:11.99]Easy.
[24:15.46]Yeah, jump the gap.
[24:18.62]Jump the gap does not mean... Please, please let me do this.
[24:22.05]Okay.
[24:28.45]The only way is up.
[24:30.27]The only way is up.
[24:32.02]Why is this guy echoing in my head, by the way?
[24:35.38]What a destructible environment!
[24:36.66]They must have learned a thing or two from the frostbite engine!
[24:41.36]Dude, I'd be so surprised if, like, somebody that worked in this game didn't also work on the Frostbite engine.
[24:45.38]Okay, just look it.
[24:46.96]Look at the stun.
[24:56.26]It's a very long search.
[25:02.05]Very clearly, there's, like, the guns and shit are on the ground.
[25:07.07]You would think that this guy would have seen the weapon on the ground.
[25:10.99]Rather than fumble around for his contacts.
[25:12.95]Alright, this just became the best game ever.
[25:27.54]I'm pretty sure this is now my favorite game ever.
[25:34.08]I'm just going to have anything.
[25:35.88]Nah, he doesn't have anything.
[25:38.96]Yeah.
[25:41.88]Okay, bye.
[25:46.87]Can you do that while they're still alive?
[25:49.65]If you can, this game is like greatest game ever.
[25:53.95]Yeah, and by the way, those guys were dead.
[25:56.13]Those guys were not alive.
[26:00.91]Why were they making noise?
[26:07.91]Oh, that's gonna be so funny.
[26:09.03]I'm gonna shoot somebody through the skull.
[26:11.69]And then pick him up and throw him and he's gonna go... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[26:20.40]Crouch.
[26:22.62]Hold to go prone.
[26:25.44]Oh, wait.
[26:25.66]Blue butterflies.
[26:26.73]Did you guys see that?
[26:28.23]That means... What?
[26:31.23]No.
[26:34.03]Okay.
[26:34.89]I'm gonna get the general.
[26:36.41]And we gotta get rid of these officers.
[26:38.09]Okay.
[26:38.49]And then there's optional shit too.
[26:40.15]Cool.
[26:43.30]The joke I was gonna make was The Last Guardian joke, but I think it's been too long.
[26:46.88]I can't make that joke now.
[26:49.28]I saw the blue butterflies and I was gonna be like, oh, there must be a treat somewhere!
[26:52.32]That would've been such a good clip.
[26:53.87]Damn it.
[26:55.21]Hold on.
[26:58.80]This is for the video.
[27:00.18]This is for, like, the Sniper Elite 4 video that's gonna go on Second Jerma.
[27:02.79]Okay, ready?
[27:03.31]Just, like, three, two, one.
[27:06.73]Little thing to go underneath there.
[27:07.61]Alright, cool.
[27:09.11]Climb underneath it.
[27:11.13]What was that?
[27:11.51]Oh, is it blue butterflies?
[27:14.35]Oh, damn.
[27:14.75]That's probably, like, a treat around, you know what I mean?
[27:18.94]Get that in the video!
[27:31.38]Wait, what?
[27:34.05]There's a new one.
[27:35.09]There's a new weapon.
[27:40.76]Why did they want me to do that?
[27:41.56]Okay.
[27:44.27]Uh, so I'm assuming, uh, there's a... Return show tutorial.
[27:49.37]Sound masks?
[27:50.89]Sound masks are a useful way of firing standard weapons without enemies hearing the gunshot.
[27:54.85]Look for the sound mask symbol on the screen if you aren't sure where to fire.
[27:57.49]Or when to fire.
[28:00.00]Okay.
[28:08.46]So where's the sound?
[28:09.62]I mean, I just saw that.
[28:10.34]Is it going to happen again?
[28:18.41]Is this guy right here?
[28:22.19]There's a guy right there.
[28:27.16]Two people here.
[28:27.78]Okay.
[28:29.92]Destroy cameras.
[28:35.26]Oh, it's a plane.
[28:36.04]Okay.
[28:36.20]Okay.
[28:43.59]Anything else?
[28:44.57]This guy's... No, no, tag him.
[28:47.85]Oh.
[28:49.01]There is... I feel like this is just a far away hitman.
[28:55.56]You know what I mean?
[28:56.06]It's like, oh, find all the interesting ways to... Yeah.
[29:09.24]Noises and non-lethal shots can help the enemy triangulate your location.
[29:13.16]If this happens too much in the same location, yeah, they'll figure out where you are.
[29:16.91]Before this, suspected threats appear on the radar as triangle, whereas a ghost image will appear in the environment.
[29:23.53]Alright, hold on.
[29:24.33]Let me... Loud gunshots close to an enemy... Alright, so did I get it?
[29:36.92]What the fuck?
[29:39.73]I'm trying to, like, shoot this.
[29:41.35]Give me... Give me this.
[29:46.49]Just stay, keep standing there.
[29:48.55]Don't move.
[29:49.73]Stay right there.
[29:50.25]I don't know, I didn't, I... What happened?
[30:00.14]Oh, shit!
[30:19.17]Oh no, I just got triangulated.
[30:20.85]I know.
[30:34.22]Look, look, look.
[30:34.68]Listen, listen, listen.
[30:35.60]I know what's going on.
[30:37.12]I know what's going on.
[30:40.06]I know what's going on.
[30:41.10]I'm just like, I was trying to make a joke and I was hoping I was going to fail the tutorial and start over right there.
[30:47.41]I like I know this book drop.
[30:48.61]I just I was hoping that it was gonna be like oh you failed Like restart that part of the tutorial and it didn't happen, so I just kept shooting I Was thinking that it was gonna start me over But no I gotta make the bed that I slept in Okay, that's fine The further a bullet travels the more it will drop yeah
[31:12.01]Aiming above the target at an appropriate distance.
[31:13.67]But velocity has an impact on the curve.
[31:15.51]Yeah.
[31:16.85]Higher velocity bullets tend to have a flatter curve at shorter distances.
[31:21.17]They drop sooner.
[31:21.89]Okay.
[31:27.44]Now, how far away is this guy?
[31:33.42]213?
[31:33.44]220?
[31:34.40]Can I, like, just restart checkpoint?
[31:36.32]Yeah.
[31:37.56]Okay, I can do it manually.
[31:38.96]See, that's what I thought was gonna happen.
[31:40.87]This is exactly what I thought was going to happen.
[31:43.47]What the fuck was that?
[31:46.47]What?
[31:48.75]Why did he just shoot the gun?
[31:49.97]I didn't shoot the gun.
[31:52.07]I did not shoot the gun.
[31:55.11]I promise.
[31:56.67]Okay, so range adjustment.
[31:59.15]200.
[31:59.19]What does pressing E do?
[32:03.84]I don't know.
[32:08.88]So he's 189.
[32:09.18]Yeah.
[32:11.94]So that means... 200.
[32:18.61]Like, shouldn't I have, like, a marker?
[32:21.97]Of, like, where, like, how far away this is right now?
[32:23.87]You know what I'm saying?
[32:28.53]Like, all I see is... I will... Let me reload this.
[32:37.02]I didn't shoot the gun.
[32:37.78]I swear to God I didn't shoot the gun.
[32:39.24]I didn't...
[32:47.91]When you empty your... Oh, when you empty your lung... How do you empty the... Why am I not emptying my lungs?
[32:53.92]I thought it was shift.
[32:54.72]Why is it not doing anything?
[32:56.32]Oh, it's space.
[33:01.74]Oh, there we go.
[33:02.56]Okay.
[33:05.06]Is it like... Is it green?
[33:06.12]Should it be like right here?
[33:14.33]What?
[33:14.77]That doesn't make any sense.
[33:18.09]Alright, I'm... I thought I had to aim above people.
[33:22.99]I'm so confused at how this is working right now.
[33:25.96]Is it because I did the range adjustment?
[33:27.90]Hold on a second.
[33:32.16]I'm... Okay, honest to fucking god.
[33:34.72]I'm hitting zoom in and he's shooting the gun.
[33:38.33]Like, if I hit right, uh, right, uh... If I hit R, my right... If I right-click right now, he's gonna shoot the fucking gun.
[33:45.93]Watch.
[33:47.07]I didn't do that.
[33:48.33]I was zooming the fuck in.
[33:50.55]I was just zooming in.
[33:51.77]That's a fucking bug.
[33:54.89]That's a fucking bug.
[33:55.83]Let me zoom in.
[33:57.49]What the fuck is that shit?
[34:00.70]Give me a break.
[34:06.62]Alright.
[34:12.39]I got it.
[34:12.65]Alright, I just took out this guy's fucking teeth.
[34:21.87]Cover blown.
[34:23.77]Alright, I got it.
[34:25.47]Hold on, first let me deal with the fucking shitty game bug.
[34:30.32]Okay, cover blown because I had to zoom in.
[34:32.20]I gotta wait for the plane to drive.
[34:42.06]Where's this plane?
[34:46.16]Maybe he was using a death adder.
[34:49.04]Is the quick scope feature?
[34:50.44]No, don't even tell me that's true.
[34:55.41]Come on, where's this plane?
[35:05.29]Scream when you shoot.
[35:15.05]I kind of have to wait for it, right?
[35:18.69]Wait, what?
[35:19.69]Oh, there's a guy right there.
[35:22.55]I can't shoot this guy, though.
[35:24.30]I'm going to attack this guy.
[35:26.48]Tag him.
[35:27.26]I'm ready to go.
[35:28.68]There's a few people down here, I think.
[35:34.74]What?
[35:36.82]I thought that guy was a half of a person.
[35:38.72]Are those explosives?
[35:44.29]I mean, I can't blow that truck up.
[35:46.71]That's going to blow my cover.
[35:49.01]Right?
[35:52.95]Probably.
[35:53.51]I would assume.
[35:54.09]Why is there so much explosive shit around?
[35:55.67]It's everywhere.
[35:57.29]I missed my opportunity to shoot this guy.
[36:11.98]Do it.
[36:25.68]Oh look, I can actually do the next part of the tutorial.
[36:30.20]See the crouch, see the hold its pros.
[36:31.64]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[36:33.78]Okay.
[36:36.25]Alright, no more fucking around.
[36:37.43]I'm not gonna mess around.
[36:38.53]I'm gonna like actually play.
[36:42.45]I'm gonna get stuck doing this for fucking an hour, guys.
[36:44.86]I swear to god.
[37:02.52]I have no patience.
[37:07.68]I got him.
[37:12.12]Got him.
[37:12.36]Am I going to do this whole mission from right here?
[37:18.07]I got him in the eye.
[37:20.17]Oh, what the fuck?
[37:32.57]Can I get him to the ass?
[37:38.07]Who's even sniping at me right now?
[37:39.31]This guy right here?
[37:41.90]Can I get him between?
[37:43.90]No, he's like behind something.
[37:49.70]Oh, see you later!
[37:51.80]That was right through the part of the frame where you can no longer speak!
[37:54.66]Oh, who's shooting?
[38:08.11]Is this guy over here?
[38:14.48]Oh, I made him fall down.
[38:16.40]The guy fell down.
[38:25.60]The guy right here.
[38:29.76]There's like a tree in the way.
[38:30.82]When am I going to hit?
[38:35.71]Oh, here's this guy.
[38:37.73]What did I just do?
[38:38.51]I just shot the wall.
[38:45.83]I don't know why I'm doing this.
[38:47.15]Why am I, like, standing up here still?
[38:49.39]Oh, he's down here.
[38:50.15]Okay.
[38:53.47]There he is.
[38:58.07]What?
[38:58.51]He just moved his fucking head.
[39:02.11]These guys are, like, so bad.
[39:04.93]Like, really.
[39:06.39]How can these guys be as bad as me?
[39:08.33]I really don't know.
[39:13.22]Oh, that's going to hit him right in the face.
[39:20.60]Alright, what do I have to do here?
[39:21.90]Tab.
[39:23.72]Kill the general.
[39:24.38]Okay.
[39:25.58]Okay.
[39:29.93]Is he just, like, over there?
[39:31.79]How funny would that be if I've just been sitting here this whole time?
[39:34.01]Get me down.
[39:39.63]Yeah, alright.
[39:40.71]Whatever.
[39:40.99]Who cares?
[39:44.99]Yeah, they work out where you are.
[39:46.09]Moving around confuses them.
[39:48.72]Color around the radar.
[39:49.68]Red is... Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[39:51.62]Okay.
[39:55.30]There are people that are coming over here right now.
[39:57.40]Sniper Elite.
[40:01.86]Sniper Elite 2.
[40:04.46]Or 4.
[40:05.92]Sniper Elite!
[40:11.38]This guy has some of the best sniping skills.
[40:21.81]Sniper Elite!
[40:22.89]What the fuck is that guy?
[40:26.34]Why are there ghosts?
[40:34.38]uh no no I don't want to pick up the body I want to like there we go this will come in very useful Carl got my dude Carl Carl likes assets to a variety of traps and items all of which are multiple uses f to use an item okay I think I want to take that off of f
[41:01.89]Okay, let's just go kill the general and just get out of this.
[41:04.25]I've no more fucking around.
[41:05.37]I've done my share of fucking around.
[41:13.69]That's my future self telling me to get a refund?
[41:15.87]Alright, well, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[41:17.57]Let me go over here.
[41:18.85]Aren't there, like, cameras right here?
[41:22.71]Or something, yeah.
[41:23.45]Destroy some cameras.
[41:29.49]Let's go.
[41:34.96]Alright, now don't look at looking for me.
[41:37.83]Reload my shit.
[41:40.33]Am I going to do some multiplayer?
[41:41.65]Um, I don't know.
[41:42.47]Depends on how far I get.
[41:43.25]Depends on how much fun I'm having, you know?
[41:47.57]There's a guy up there, I think.
[41:52.00]Let's get in the grass.
[41:54.70]Foliage.
[41:55.74]Crouching or going prone in foliage reduces your visibility of the enemy.
[41:57.84]Okay.
[42:02.78]Security cameras in World War II.
[42:06.45]I know, right?
[42:09.33]What is this, like, Walmart?
[42:15.85]Alright, who's left?
[42:19.89]Oh, there's my chance.
[42:21.11]Right?
[42:23.83]And the plane's going by.
[42:24.55]Oh, that one was snuck through the fucking woods.
[42:36.79]Got him.
[42:37.77]Got him.
[42:38.95]Oh, and excuse me.
[42:42.61]Did you just, like, go look at your friend?
[42:44.17]World War Walmart.
[42:54.08]And then what about you?
[42:56.14]You're having a little trouble looking for somebody.
[42:58.88]You know what?
[42:59.34]I'm going to go fucking stab that guy.
[43:02.04]And holy shit, somebody just gave 50 bucks.
[43:05.88]Magpie with the 50 bucks.
[43:07.62]Mod Kevin.
[43:10.78]I don't know, but who's Kevin?
[43:14.44]Thank you so much for the 50 bucks though, dude.
[43:17.17]Much appreciated.
[43:19.39]I don't know who Kevin is.
[43:21.97]But watch one, two.
[43:28.43]I need to kill the officer and get out of here.
[43:29.77]I don't know what I'm doing.
[43:30.59]I'm spending too much time here.
[43:33.60]This is just like the dumb tutorial.
[43:44.33]What the fuck were these guys doing, man?
[43:46.81]Seriously.
[43:47.33]That guy just started dancing in the bush.
[43:52.49]I couldn't help it.
[43:53.19]I had to shoot him.
[43:57.47]I had to shoot him.
[44:02.67]Oh god.
[44:06.36]Sniper Elite!
[44:13.60]Nice.
[44:14.49]Sniped him.
[44:17.65]Alright, okay.
[44:17.99]Fucking really?
[44:19.55]Why did that guy not die from the explosion?
[44:23.87]Why did he not die?
[44:24.95]What the fuck?
[44:28.05]Alright.
[44:28.59]No fucking around.
[44:29.47]I'm done.
[44:30.37]Let's go.
[44:30.74]Wait, wait, wait.
[44:31.46]Why do I have a checkpoint right here?
[44:33.54]Just go kill the officer.
[44:34.60]Shoot him.
[44:35.12]Get me out of there.
[44:36.60]I'm fucking around too much.

[45:36.92]Where's General Schmidt?
[45:39.16]No, he's up there.
[45:40.00]Okay.
[45:40.32]Well, we're good
[45:45.64]Alright, now at least I have a checkpoint here and I'm going to calm down.
[45:52.27]Go back to Family Feud?
[45:53.53]No, I'm just fucking around.
[45:55.51]Once I get out of the tutorial, I promise I will play the game the way I'm supposed to play it.
[46:01.47]Let's just chill for a second.
[46:02.49]Let's chill out.
[46:08.84]There are three people here.
[46:12.53]At least three that I know of.
[46:13.53]There's a guy up there.
[46:14.69]Okay, I can get up here.
[46:16.81]No, somebody's looking at me.
[46:17.89]It's that guy.
[46:27.06]That guy.
[46:30.86]Jesus.
[46:33.58]You know, you just don't even know.
[46:36.85]You didn't even know you died.
[46:40.92]Oh, God.
[46:41.42]Renegade Coaster.
[46:44.06]Renegade Coaster with the 50 bucks.
[46:45.76]Jesus.
[46:46.84]Talking about Kevin again.
[46:49.40]Fucking Kevin.
[46:52.20]Thank you, Renegade, for the 50 bucks, though, dude.
[46:53.66]That's much appreciated.
[46:55.31]Much love, man.
[46:59.75]Alright.
[47:02.67]You want me to shoot somebody in the balls?
[47:04.05]Everyone wants me to shoot somebody in the balls.
[47:05.37]I just don't want to be spotted, though.
[47:09.21]What did I just say?
[47:12.22]I want to get up into the, like, the sniping roost.
[47:18.88]Is there no way?
[47:19.70]Oh, okay.
[47:20.80]What the fuck was I doing?
[47:22.28]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[47:25.51]Lie down.
[47:26.63]I'm good.
[47:27.51]Alright.
[47:28.71]Where's Mr. Schmidt?
[47:33.37]Okay.
[47:33.79]I'm going to...
[47:35.97]They're looking for me.
[47:36.47]They're on the bridge out there looking for me.
[47:38.03]Okay.
[47:38.59]That's fine.
[47:38.97]You have to keep looking for me.
[47:42.04]I'll just elite the fuck out of you.
[47:45.46]Oh god.
[47:52.22]Do I have like any grenades?
[47:55.62]Hold on.
[47:57.35]I do.
[47:59.21]How do I throw these?
[48:01.65]Press F to hold.
[48:06.58]To view the throwing arc.
[48:08.32]Okay.
[48:09.65]I mean... Like, this is Sniper Elite, but sometimes you have to, like, fucking do something else.
[48:16.31]Oh, wait.
[48:23.39]Okay.
[48:55.47]Why?
[48:55.93]That's not supposed to happen.
[49:00.23]Shit like that doesn't happen in the fucking real world.
[49:02.55]I don't understand.
[49:13.42]It was stuck to that guy's head and he didn't even care.
[49:15.99]It got stuck.
[49:19.14]Alright, what else do I have?
[49:19.94]What is this?
[49:20.38]A rock?
[49:21.58]Oh my god, there's rocks in this game.
[49:23.76]You can just throw rocks.
[49:25.56]You can just fucking throw rocks at people.
[49:30.06]Please tell me one of these is gonna kill him eventually.
[49:31.70]It has to, right?
[49:32.36]Please.
[49:34.18]Please tell me I can hit this guy in the fucking head with rocks until he dies.
[49:40.11]It's gonna do like the little cutscene when it like shows... Yeah, that guy had a helmet on.
[49:42.81]Hold on.
[49:46.07]Oh, fuck.
[49:46.81]Come on.
[49:49.73]Give me the cutscene.
[49:51.22]And have him die.
[49:53.72]Please, please game.
[49:54.88]If you are the best game ever made... Let this rock break his skull in half.
[50:02.66]Oh shit, come on.
[50:07.53]Alright, this guy's standing still.
[50:08.55]He's easier.
[50:14.53]Oh, I wonder what's happening.
[50:16.29]Oh, there he is!
[50:16.89]Finally found him!
[50:19.10]I've been getting hit in the face with ROCKS for ten minutes!
[50:21.49]I think he was up there!
[50:22.55]Shit.
[50:31.77]Alright, fucking, alright, that's enough.
[50:35.17]That's fine.
[50:41.89]That's okay with me.
[50:46.09]I'm going to die.
[50:46.85]I'm going to die.
[50:48.39]My final wish is to throw one rock at this guy's face.
[50:53.41]Put a scope on the rock.
[50:57.04]Where was this checkpoint?
[50:58.06]I don't even know.
[50:58.56]Okay, at least it's right here.
[51:03.42]Okay.
[51:04.44]No more fucking around.
[51:05.32]Let's go.
[51:10.67]And by no more fucking around, I kind of like didn't really should have just done that.
[51:21.00]Cover blown.
[51:26.04]For the love of God.
[51:26.87]You know what?
[51:29.57]What the hell is this?
[51:30.47]S mine?
[51:30.97]Teller mine?
[51:32.71]Trip mine.
[51:37.27]Trip mine.
[51:43.86]Come and get me, motherfucker.
[51:47.92]Come and get me.
[51:51.13]I'll be here waiting for you.
[51:56.62]Come on up the stairs.
[51:59.94]No, don't shoot me.
[52:00.62]Walk up here.
[52:02.37]Walk the fuck up here.
[52:03.29]Oh my god.
[52:05.41]Fine.
[52:17.74]I gotta stop messing around.
[52:18.82]I can't help it, guys.
[52:20.78]I have to fucking fuck around in games like this.
[52:22.62]I have to.
[52:25.28]I can't go anywhere.
[52:26.71]I've fucked around too much.
[52:29.03]I have to wait till they all leave.
[52:34.43]I can't stick around.
[52:36.49]I need to wait until... Are they coming up here?
[52:50.44]Don't you fucking dare.
[52:52.72]Come on.
[52:53.18]Enemy's searching.
[52:55.56]We need to find him.
[52:59.32]This guy's right here.
[53:00.28]Why did I just do that?
[53:03.10]Now I can't leave.
[53:04.00]I need to wait till I get... They're not looking for me anymore.
[53:23.68]Oh no.
[53:28.67]I'm going to have to do this again because this guy is going to walk up here.
[53:33.49]He's going to walk up the stairs and he's going to fucking die.
[53:35.99]He's so slowly making his way over here.
[53:56.65]Somebody's gonna walk up the stairs.
[54:01.63]I would just escape, but there's people everywhere.
[54:04.71]I'm gonna get seen if I get out of here.
[54:06.61]I have to wait.
[54:09.19]I know, I know, if I jump, if I look at all the dots, if I jump over the railing, someone's gonna, if I stand up, watch this, someone's gonna see me.
[54:17.32]Like, I have to wait till these guys all leave.
[54:20.60]Look at this, like, there's too many people.
[54:32.76]Plane's going by.
[54:33.30]Can I take this back?
[54:40.95]Can I actually pick this up?
[54:42.31]I think I can, right?
[54:46.37]Okay, defuse it and take it.
[55:03.29]Go over there.
[55:04.21]Go look at the rock.
[55:12.52]Okay.
[55:15.26]Safe.
[55:17.16]Safe for now.
[55:40.33]Where the fuck is this other guy?
[55:41.39]Oh, he's right there.
[55:50.26]Alright.
[55:52.08]Alright, we're good.
[55:56.38]There's one last guy right here.
[55:57.52]I'm gonna shoot this guy with a regular gun, because I don't feel like getting caught anymore.
[56:00.22]So, where are you going?
[56:01.12]This way?
[56:02.70]That's where you're going, buddy.
[56:08.77]Cover blown.
[56:09.55]Send telegram.
[56:15.10]I've never had bullets in this fucking gun.
[56:16.40]Alright.
[56:25.36]Now... Now I'm good.
[56:31.95]No rock kills.
[56:36.01]No rock kills yet.
[56:37.37]We will get one.
[56:39.19]This guy's so dead.
[56:40.89]I'm just gonna make this guy, like, gonna make a joke out of this one.
[56:45.27]That wasn't even a joke.
[56:50.33]Now, yeah, you know, they know where I am.
[56:51.62]That's fine.
[56:52.14]Doesn't even matter.
[56:53.64]I'm gonna, like, go over here and, like, duck.
[57:00.66]Let's go hide in the fucking bush for, like, five seconds.
[57:04.74]And we're good.
[57:09.58]Sorry, you can't always watch live, so here's some money.
[57:11.22]Well, thanks a lot, Heartbroken.
[57:13.42]Don't worry about it.
[57:14.12]Thanks for, uh, sticking around.
[57:17.18]Now they're all coming out.
[57:19.48]Why the fuck are they all coming out?
[57:21.24]God damn it!
[57:24.16]What the fuck?
[57:26.75]See, I did this to myself by fucking around so much and having the checkpoint be up in the place where, like, a hundred people were, because I was throwing grenades.
[57:34.15]I, like, fucking ruined the tutorial because I was throwing rocks at people and throwing fucking grenades at people.
[57:40.42]For the love of God!
[57:41.34]I had- I had to fucking do that, didn't I?
[57:50.65]Just come fucking running over here.
[57:58.25]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[57:59.24]Keep shooting at me.
[58:00.04]Fuck you guys.
[58:07.66]Go find me.
[58:08.34]I was over there somewhere.
[58:13.41]Just gonna wait till they get out here and I can move to this next bush.
[58:22.13]Like, can you drive cars in this game?
[58:23.85]Looks like there's an opportunity.
[58:30.64]They're just, like, chasing me right now.
[58:36.76]God damn it.
[58:41.35]I'm so dead.
[58:42.47]There's like no way I'm fucking getting out of this.
[58:44.77]I might have to restart this mission and just do it the normal way.
[58:47.33]Because it keeps giving me chip.
[58:48.39]Can I get in the fucking car?
[58:52.82]Of course not.
[59:06.15]How did I just fucking make it through that?
[59:07.41]Did that actually just happen?
[59:16.28]Apparently that just happened.
[59:24.02]What was that?
[59:24.78]What was that explosion?
[59:33.65]Get in the car.
[59:34.29]What do you think this is?
[59:35.11]Alright, don't worry.
[59:45.15]I'm gonna save it right here.
[59:48.69]I'll be fine.
[59:53.83]Well, apparently they saw me.
[59:57.49]I fucked up this whole thing from the very beginning.
[59:59.45]Ugh, like, I can't, I gotta remember, like, I can't, like, I can't, if it's gonna autosave me after throwing grenades at people, like, what the fuck am I supposed to do?
[60:15.26]Shit.
[60:18.05]That's the only reason why that happened.
[60:24.03]Yeah, I know this is the tutorial level.
[60:26.21]I know.
[60:27.55]And I know that I was fucking around and fucked it all up.
[60:30.06]I didn't think it was gonna, like, auto-save me after I threw fucking three grenades.
[60:35.72]Are you... Are you fucking serious?
[60:39.02]That was him!
[60:39.88]That was him!
[60:40.88]That was the guy!
[60:41.38]Go!
[60:42.88]That was the guy!
[60:44.57]That was general shit!
[60:47.21]I did it!
[60:57.84]Oh, you fucking piece of shit game.
[61:10.12]We're just sitting here for a little while.
[61:21.89]Okay, so I went... I got right... General Schmidt.
[61:28.37]This is fucking fun.
[61:29.25]Alright, let's just like throw some rocks over there.
[61:36.09]Hey, what's that?
[61:36.53]You want a rock?
[61:37.15]I need to search his body for intel.
[61:46.24]We have to go back, I know.
[61:51.99]That's the worst part about it.
[61:52.99]I mean, I could just start throwing other grenades up there.
[61:55.13]Should I?
[61:55.49]No.
[61:56.23]No.
[61:56.65]That's how I got myself into trouble.
[61:57.85]It's the tutorial.
[61:59.60]Stop getting yourself into trouble.
[62:07.78]Well, it's okay.
[62:12.68]I have it saved.
[62:13.24]It's saved right here.
[62:14.00]It's a saved game.
[62:14.52]Let's make sure it's saved.
[62:17.35]If I'm having this much fun in the tutorial fucking around, then I feel like this game is going to be really fun.
[62:23.97]But, like, what the fuck is... There's people just still standing here.
[62:29.85]Still on Tutorial Island.
[62:31.12]Yeah, I know.
[62:32.76]It's mainly on purpose, trust me.
[62:35.86]You can't give me stuff like this.
[62:37.16]You can't give me rocks to throw at people and grenades to throw at people and expect me to not use them.
[62:42.04]You know?
[62:44.60]Like, what world do you think we're living in where you think I'm not going to spend, like, at least 30 minutes throwing rocks at people?
[62:52.64]Let's just peek our head up a little bit here.
[62:53.94]Okay, it wants me to destroy the cameras.
[62:59.75]I mean, I guess I'm going to wait for the plane.
[63:05.73]This guy's so dumb.
[63:07.65]Like, you can't be that dumb.
[63:15.49]I'm just waiting for the plane to come by so I can please just shoot this camera.
[63:19.03]And then I need to get rid of both.
[63:20.57]You know what?
[63:23.86]It's not... They're not getting out of this mode.
[63:28.81]Why are they not leaving the alert mode?
[63:30.77]It's kind of... Like, what?
[63:37.47]Well... Okay.
[63:42.58]Like, fucking die.
[63:43.68]Like, I guess that's what we're doing.
[63:44.84]Everybody has really big eyes.
[64:03.46]Actually, no, it came from right here.
[64:04.86]Okay.
[64:16.69]This is cheating.
[64:18.71]This is cheating.
[64:25.01]We don't know how to shoot through the hedges, but you do!
[64:28.25]Oh, shit!
[64:31.33]I'm gonna be okay.
[64:32.55]I'm gonna be okay.
[64:34.19]I think I'm gonna be alright.
[64:41.65]I'm not gonna be alright.
[64:46.75]Where is he?
[64:48.88]Where is he?
[64:52.56]Oh, he's right there.
[65:04.51]Alright, I'll try to get somebody.
[65:07.53]I'll try to get somebody with a crotch shot.
[65:14.28]Pick up the body.
[65:22.66]Where's this fucking intel?
[65:27.10]Just get out of here.
[65:27.72]Let me just finish this dumb tutorial.
[65:36.81]There he is.
[65:37.17]Alright, search him for his intel.
[65:39.07]You got it.
[65:42.15]Got it.
[65:43.31]Beat the tutorial.
[65:46.54]Safes hold important items and every safe has a code.
[65:50.66]Make sure to search important looking enemies for key code.
[65:52.66]Or you can just blow up the safe with a satchel charge.
[65:58.08]Might destroy some things.
[65:59.22]Alright.
[66:00.57]Cool.
[66:02.95]Alright, let's take him with us.
[66:04.65]Just in case we need to throw him at somebody.
[66:08.87]I hope there's somebody in here.
[66:09.75]Please hope there's somebody in here.
[66:10.61]Just whip them.
[66:11.39]Just throw them into him.
[66:12.47]Please.
[66:12.89]Give me, like, one person.
[66:15.95]Give me one, like, janitor.
[66:19.67]There's no random janitor in this game.
[66:22.21]I can't just, like, fucking sprint down a hallway and, like, whip them.
[66:27.74]Alright.
[66:28.28]I want to be real clear about this.
[66:29.22]Let's be very clear.
[66:29.98]Ready?
[66:30.52]Watch this.
[66:31.82]Okay.
[66:32.18]This guy is not alive.
[66:33.84]Not even close.
[66:37.20]Ready?
[66:37.34]Ready?
[66:44.86]He's making noise.
[66:46.13]He's like, ugh!
[66:51.81]This guy's not supposed to be alive!
[66:53.39]Alright, how do I open the door?
[66:56.91]How do I get in the safe door?
[66:58.67]Kick it in.
[67:02.35]No, I gotta go up.
[67:10.60]Yes, in the middle of occupied Italy, there's gonna be a janitor cleaning a house.
[67:13.82]I don't know!
[67:16.26]I don't know.
[67:18.00]There's always like a random janitor in these games.
[67:20.06]There's always like a random cleaning person.
[67:21.89]Just hanging out.
[67:26.11]Suppressed ammo will allow you to fire your weapon silently.
[67:27.89]You can change ammo types in the radial menu.
[67:29.61]Cool.
[67:36.82]So I can change ammo types.
[67:40.36]Regular ammo or suppressed ammo?
[67:42.46]Suppressed ammo.
[67:44.16]Alright, nice.
[67:48.80]It's the ground moaning.
[67:52.78]Okay.
[67:53.72]Kill Nazi officers.
[67:54.58]That is to get more kills.
[67:58.69]There's an officer over there.
[67:59.73]Let me pull up binoculars.
[68:03.29]If I can just get rid of some of these people.
[68:07.33]Just like there.
[68:08.17]This is like a fairly long tutorial.
[68:11.85]Even with the amount of times I've been fucking around, I feel like this is just... There's a lot to do in this tutorial.
[68:18.13]Secure checkpoint.
[68:18.89]Kill officer.
[68:19.69]Kill officer.
[68:20.57]Kill officer.
[68:21.23]Gonna go back that way.
[68:22.01]Um... Where's this go?
[68:30.71]I wish there wasn't C to drop.
[68:32.05]I wish it was just space.
[68:34.32]I may have just accidentally almost killed myself.
[68:44.16]Oh!
[68:44.66]That was a walk and talk.
[68:46.02]That was a walk and talk.
[68:53.71]That's the sound of a Razer DeathAdder.
[68:58.12]Alright.
[68:58.50]I don't want to fuck this up.
[69:05.30]Save it right here.
[69:09.68]Medpack?
[69:10.34]I do have medpacks, don't I?
[69:13.94]I'm trying to... How do I use it?
[69:18.31]There we go.
[69:23.25]Okay.
[69:37.34]I don't like being in this close.
[69:38.32]Can I go in any of these houses?
[69:44.92]There's a guy right up there.
[69:50.25]I don't even need to do that.
[69:53.29]Fine.
[69:53.61]There's your shot, guys.
[69:55.37]That's what you wanted.
[69:57.25]That's what you want.
[69:59.64]You got it.
[70:03.16]And... Bleh.
[70:07.86]What am I doing?
[70:23.51]Come on.
[70:27.27]Oh no, what are you doing?
[70:30.59]Why are you going that way?
[70:33.77]Why are they going that way?
[70:34.85]Oh, for the love of God.
[70:38.58]You try to make something... You try to make a joke, and it blows up in your face.
[70:50.62]Where is it?
[70:53.98]I want this guy just to go... Okay, I don't know if that... Was that guy looking for me, or was it just, like, sunny out?
[71:02.38]I'm not sure.
[71:12.02]Okay, what a sicko.
[71:21.35]You're supposed to, alright, you're supposed, in this game, you're supposed to, like, take out the enemies, right?
[71:26.69]What kind of, like, sick fuck does that?
[71:29.25]Not only does it once, it does it twice.
[71:34.55]You have to be some type of fucking maniac.
[71:38.79]You are a maniac.
[71:44.42]Turn on maximum x-rays?
[71:49.06]That was fucking terrible.
[71:55.07]We didn't even get an x-ray.
[71:56.13]What?
[71:58.04]What the fuck was that?
[72:03.18]Something about that is so fucking terrible.
[72:06.79]You're just like... I can't find anything else.
[72:10.85]Ayayay.
[72:12.79]What an intense game.
[72:14.59]More x-rays?
[72:18.07]Where would it be?
[72:18.60]They're gonna game?
[72:24.66]Tutorials, empty lung, aim assist.
[72:27.44]I didn't... I didn't put that on.
[72:29.84]Bullet kill cam.
[72:32.11]Increased.
[72:36.31]Increased melee kill cams.
[72:37.88]Increased trap cameras.
[72:39.20]Yes.
[72:40.00]Quick cameras.
[72:40.54]No.
[72:41.02]X-rays.
[72:42.56]Yes.
[72:45.38]Is that what you wanted?
[72:45.96]I mean, there's increased and then there's frequently.
[72:52.22]I'm assuming it's frequently.
[72:55.04]Why would I do that, though?
[72:55.82]That sounds terrible.
[72:57.99]Aim assist only if you have a controller plugged in.
[73:02.87]Aim assist only if you have a controller plugged in.
[73:07.62]Don't make fun of me if you have an aim assist on.
[73:09.78]I didn't want it on.
[73:11.16]I didn't choose to have it on.
[73:12.11]Alright, we gotta go this way now.
[73:15.49]Last couple officers are over here.
[73:19.93]Track him.
[73:20.57]Alright, let's go.
[73:24.33]Frequently increased.
[73:25.37]I think we can be out of this.
[73:30.74]I mean, this technically is the tutorial, but you know, it's all good.
[73:38.10]Don't just sprint in there.
[73:38.96]I'm going to make myself not known to the enemy.
[73:44.31]You know, all the enemies.
[73:45.37]Look at all these enemies.
[73:46.09]I'm going to go for a rock kill.
[73:50.51]I so badly want this guy to just come over here.
[73:55.92]You know what would be just fucking fantastic?
[73:58.06]If this guy came over and looked over the side.
[74:05.32]Come on.
[74:05.78]Like, come look over here.
[74:07.22]And let me hit you right in the face with a rock if you fall.
[74:10.11]Do that for me.
[74:13.33]God, I would... Yeah, sound turd.
[74:14.45]Alright, here we go.
[74:15.29]This is gonna be it.
[74:15.71]This is gonna be fucking incredible.
[74:24.22]Come see what that sound was.
[74:27.76]Come see what that sound... Come see what that...
[74:34.39]Come see what that sound was.
[74:44.92]No, he's like coming down, you fucking idiot.
[74:56.77]Come on.
[74:57.83]Come on.
[74:59.43]Come on.
[75:00.33]There he is.
[75:00.67]There he is.
[75:00.97]There he is.
[75:01.27]There he is.
[75:01.69]Oh my god.
[75:02.05]Oh my god.
[75:02.43]Oh my god.
[75:02.87]Oh my god.
[75:04.03]Oh my god.
[75:06.06]Did I get him?
[75:07.88]It's gonna hit him.
[75:10.72]Oh.
[75:11.44]Oh.
[75:11.92]I tapped him.
[75:12.72]Just a little tap.
[75:18.50]Wait.
[75:21.50]What is this guy doing?
[75:27.21]This dude just got hit with like two rocks and decided he was going to go have lunch.
[75:35.00]Okay, buddy.
[75:35.92]Whatever you say.
[75:38.90]That's so unfortunate.
[75:40.34]God damn it.
[75:44.37]I wish he would just walk to the edge.
[75:49.37]Okay, now all of a sudden.
[75:50.19]Now he wants to come over here all of a sudden.
[75:53.11]I need to tag him.
[75:59.61]I need to fucking track this guy and tag this dude.
[76:02.65]There he is.
[76:03.41]Okay.
[76:04.79]Got you tagged.
[76:06.71]Now that's all I needed.
[76:09.25]That's all I needed, buddy.
[76:13.27]Right here.
[76:15.31]Go check it out.
[76:18.81]Check that noise out.
[76:20.27]Oh, okay.
[76:21.61]Just a little bit closer.
[76:22.59]Right here.
[76:23.71]Right there.
[76:24.71]What was that noise?
[76:26.89]Who knows?
[76:27.25]Who knows what that one was?
[76:28.85]Wait, what?
[76:30.45]Check out that noise right there.
[76:32.47]You know you want to go check that out.
[76:33.51]Go look at the rock.
[76:34.02]Somebody's throwing it.
[76:40.44]Not much further.
[76:40.96]Come on.
[76:43.80]This is going to be fucking worth it.
[76:44.72]You guys know it.
[76:46.04]You guys know this shit.
[76:46.90]This is going to be worth it.
[76:51.60]There it is.
[76:54.69]There it is.
[76:55.51]One, two more steps to your right.
[76:59.89]Come on.
[77:02.23]Just walk two more steps forward.
[77:04.83]That's all I need you to do.
[77:08.48]Oh, you dumbass.
[77:19.57]Come on.
[77:24.25]I have to get this.
[77:29.71]Okay, alright.
[77:30.29]Got him.
[77:30.61]Got him.
[77:35.86]You know what, dude?
[77:36.50]You know what?
[77:36.92]Like, I'm getting real sick and tired of this shit.
[77:41.90]Nah, I'm... Alright.
[77:42.96]I tried.
[77:43.82]I tried.
[77:44.12]Like, y'all know that if he had, like, taken a step further and I hit him right in the head with a rock, he would have fell forward and died.
[77:51.55]And you want to talk about, like, joke of the stream?
[77:54.31]That would have been it.
[77:57.27]I'm like mad right now, so I'm just shooting and missing.
[78:01.08]Here he comes.
[78:01.54]Oh, what was that noise?
[78:02.76]Oh, now I want to see what was going on over here.
[78:04.52]Oh, somebody just shot me from right now.
[78:08.89]I don't know where he was.
[78:09.85]I think he was right here somewhere.
[78:10.93]Fucking asshole.
[78:25.27]Thanks for the fucking 1500, man.
[78:32.90]We already got the joke of the stream, The Last Guardian reference.
[78:37.50]Oh, shit.
[78:38.06]Well, I'm going the other way now.
[78:39.08]I'm walking around.
[78:41.33]It's not hard to hit when you have aim assist.
[78:44.79]It still is.
[78:45.97]It still is difficult.
[78:48.71]Can I get up there this way?
[78:51.15]I think so.
[78:58.23]Well, there's one more guy to get rid of.
[78:59.65]At least up here.
[79:04.48]We'll get this guy first.
[79:06.14]We'll take out his friends later.
[79:07.18]Uh, there's two guys.
[79:12.70]Right?
[79:13.28]I mean, we just blow the truck up, right?
[79:15.53]Just blow up the truck.
[79:16.99]Who even cares?
[79:19.37]I'm throwing like two rocks over there.
[79:25.18]I don't even know what happened.
[79:36.95]What was that?
[79:39.03]What the fuck was that?
[79:40.97]Did I just headshot the car?
[79:43.57]I just headshot the car.
[79:51.53]Oh, that poor car.
[79:52.57]It did the same like skeleton you headshot the person.
[79:58.83]What the fuck?
[80:04.63]The car was alive.
[80:05.61]I broke the car's jaw and teeth and shit.
[80:15.58]That's so stupid.
[80:23.24]It blew it up eventually.
[80:24.26]Wait, what?
[80:29.68]Alright, let's just get out of here.
[80:32.38]I'm done.
[80:33.37]I keep saying this over and over again, but for real, I gotta get out of this mission.
[80:41.11]And I'm gonna have so much trouble getting out of the next one.
[80:43.71]You guys know that to be a fact.
[80:47.56]One more officer.
[80:48.54]Final curtain, buddy.
[80:52.06]There's this guy right here.
[80:58.22]Mm-hmm.
[80:59.60]Where you at?
[81:00.60]There you are.
[81:03.56]Okay.
[81:05.52]Here comes your last little friend.
[81:06.94]See ya.
[81:10.33]We're just going through this.
[81:11.35]Destroy the camera.
[81:15.53]And then shoot that last guy.
[81:17.85]He's, like, right over here.
[81:26.25]Wrap around.
[81:26.98]Got him in the shoulder.
[81:30.62]Okay.
[81:39.89]Uh-huh.
[81:41.07]Now, where's this last officer?
[81:46.83]He's, like, right here, right?
[81:50.60]Go this way.
[81:52.85]Clear the checkpoint.
[81:54.41]I mean, I'm here.
[81:55.37]Should I just do it?
[81:56.57]It is, like, right there.
[81:57.33]I mean, if we're gonna do every part of the tutorial, might as well.
[82:08.52]Have I not secured this checkpoint?
[82:09.88]I don't get this.
[82:11.42]Isn't that what I've done already?
[82:18.35]Uh... What's in the house?
[82:23.98]Yeah, you know how we're killing the last officer.
[82:25.76]It's certain.
[82:27.66]I gotta... I'm gonna get a couple... Hold on.
[82:31.95]Uh, where you at?
[82:33.81]Yeah.
[82:39.73]Oh, fuck it.
[82:40.21]Let's just go.
[82:43.44]Go this way.
[82:48.76]It's below me.
[82:49.80]Ah, whatever.
[82:58.90]That guy was waving at me.
[83:03.34]That guy wasn't even trying to attack me.
[83:04.46]He just wanted to wave to me.
[83:08.46]Hey there, stranger!
[83:09.54]Right in the ear.
[83:30.52]Is he gonna- is he gonna swim?
[83:41.71]No!
[83:48.29]Why did I- You could even see my hand move.
[83:53.34]OH!
[83:56.91]What happened?
[83:57.45]I thought I was gonna drop, grab the ledge.
[84:00.27]I was gonna grab the ledge.
[84:01.45]I was gonna drop down and grab the ledge.
[84:03.89]That's the only time that's ever not happened.
[84:07.01]Oh, what the fuck?
[84:07.97]Thank God I'm just right here.
[84:12.30]I thought I was gonna grab the ledge, like, and slide around.
[84:15.44]Why would that?
[84:16.26]That was the only time I've... You're not gonna pretend that that, you know, whatever.
[84:19.80]I'm just so glad.
[84:20.88]Let's headshot this fucking guy right here.
[84:23.98]Oh, headshot incoming.
[84:25.90]Oh, no!
[84:29.99]Nice headshot.
[84:44.80]Escape from the island.
[84:45.82]Okay.
[84:46.22]Let's get the fuck out of here.
[84:47.92]Get me out.
[84:48.64]Goodbye.
[84:49.10]I just need to get down there.
[84:51.80]I can't jump down there though.
[84:53.11]Fuck.
[84:53.49]Come on.
[84:54.71]Let me jump down there.
[84:55.83]There's a ladder right here.
[84:59.53]Really?
[85:01.19]Yeah.
[85:01.57]Get it.
[85:03.55]Mike, is it going to hurt me?
[85:09.11]Okay.
[85:09.39]We're safe.
[85:22.05]Just please let me climb over the fucking rocks.
[85:27.63]Last shot.
[85:28.13]It's gotta be a good one.
[85:29.03]Moving.
[85:29.83]While moving.
[85:32.39]Ooh.
[85:34.95]Ooh.
[85:35.39]Nope.
[85:35.57]There's one more guy.
[85:36.49]Where is he?
[85:41.51]I swear to fucking god, man.
[85:46.16]I swear to God.
[85:48.04]All of a sudden there's all these dangerous ledges.
[85:50.98]All of a sudden, just kind of out of nowhere, there's all these dangerous fucking ledges that'll kill you.
[85:59.53]All of a fucking sudden, they just come out of nowhere, apparently.
[86:04.53]I'm just trying to walk around.
[86:06.67]That's all I want to do.
[86:09.63]I want to just walk out.
[86:13.41]Like, honest to fucking G's, man.
[86:14.99]Like, I just want to walk down.
[86:18.14]And there's all these stupid fucking fences everywhere that make that not possible.
[86:22.10]And I'm going to die again.
[86:23.84]Because now, I'm dead again.
[86:25.52]Because I'm just, like, standing around being like an idiot.
[86:27.45]Hold on a second.
[86:27.99]I don't have any health kits left.
[86:30.99]But don't fucking matter.
[86:33.49]Get out of here.
[86:43.70]Okay.
[86:45.70]There's this guy.
[86:46.49]Yeah, you can't just run around like an idiot.
[86:49.87]Yep, they know where I am.
[86:50.89]That's fine.
[86:52.31]Don't walk forward and fall into the mirage.
[86:55.55]Like, see, walking forward right here?
[86:57.45]I thought that was it.
[86:58.61]Like, there it is!
[86:59.03]There's the water!
[86:59.61]There's my escape!
[87:00.79]No.
[87:02.40]This is a gigantic ledge.
[87:03.64]I'm going to have to kill these two and walk down here.
[87:14.73]They come.
[87:19.33]Let's just skip.
[87:28.51]Yeah.
[87:30.16]There we go.
[87:31.80]There it is.
[87:35.78]Make our way slowly down the steps.
[87:40.82]And walk out.
[87:42.86]One guy...
[87:46.78]Save it right here.
[87:47.52]I'm going to call this a shitty Dark Souls clone.
[87:54.92]No.
[87:56.10]Why would I do that?
[87:57.81]My heart rate is too high.
[87:59.35]You guys want to talk about aim assist?
[88:00.49]Like I need aim assist?
[88:01.91]I'll show you in a second why I don't aim assist.
[88:09.25]Yeah, that's an exploded... That's an exploded lung.
[88:13.51]Gosh, I think I need aim assist.
[88:16.43]See how long of a shot that was?
[88:17.52]That was wild moving too.
[88:24.46]That was wild moving.
[88:25.60]Got that fucking guy.
[88:38.39]Oh yeah, I did it.

[91:34.01]The invasion of Sicily imminent.
[91:36.23]It's crucial we find out what the Nazis are up to.
[91:39.92]Oh, there is no Kevin.

[92:06.29]Nice.
[92:06.53]Okay.
[92:06.71]Get the radio guy.
[92:07.85]Get the sniper guy.
[92:28.80]Alright.
[92:29.02]Find radio operator before he calls for reinforcements and kill the sniper.
[92:38.00]Springfield for the... Let's see.
[92:39.62]Isn't this the same thing?
[92:41.56]Muscle velocity, stability.
[92:44.40]I'll take it.
[92:44.86]I'll keep it.
[92:45.40]Okay.
[92:46.88]Let's go.
[92:47.26]He is... Sniper is right there.
[92:52.09]Local radio man.
[92:53.33]Let's kill the sniper first because I feel like he's going to be causing way more problems for me.
[93:01.92]Take the gun out.
[93:02.64]Take out a gun.
[93:04.24]I was going to... I thought this was a bad guy.
[93:08.88]I thought that was a bad guy.
[93:13.02]I just got startled.
[93:15.24]A lot of brave men died on the Orchidia.
[93:18.25]We need to make sure their sacrifice was worth it.
[93:20.83]We need to find Kessler.
[93:22.53]Yep.
[93:23.11]They told me you were a to-the-point kind of guy.
[93:26.51]I'm Jack Weaver, by the way.
[93:31.65]Scary.
[93:31.83]Jump scares.
[93:32.17]Not that much, apparently.
[93:33.07]Is the guy doing makeup?
[93:34.57]Is that like blush?
[93:35.73]Alright, give me a little bit of rouge on my cheeks.
[93:37.15]Yep, thank you.
[93:39.35]You look great.
[94:01.11]You look great.
[94:05.77]Okay, bye.
[94:11.43]Sniper in the area.
[94:12.13]It'll help locate... And there's... Find the HQ.
[94:15.76]Alright, we gotta take care of this guy first.
[94:24.30]No, it would be... It'd be great if I... Kind of...
[94:32.60]Is this like a hub?
[94:33.30]I don't understand.
[94:34.88]Sorry.
[94:38.44]Hey, you don't sound too well.
[94:41.46]You must be Lieutenant Fairburn.
[94:43.83]I've been told to take you to our leader, Sophia.
[94:46.99]We call her the Angel.
[94:49.11]I'll make my own way.
[94:51.17]Why is there like a hub?
[94:53.39]They've gone through the town, taking our people.
[94:56.21]The Angel is planning a rescue.
[94:57.99]She sounds like a brave woman.
[95:00.01]You know about Commando Bethel.
[95:02.94]You don't sound too well.
[95:04.08]He caught your cold.
[95:06.04]Oh, cool.
[95:07.00]Thanks.
[95:07.38]Great.
[95:07.64]Thank you for the intel.
[95:28.06]Search the graveyard.
[95:28.68]This is just like dumb little side missions.
[95:30.16]This is not what it is.
[95:30.94]It's like the crossroads.
[95:32.00]I don't want like fucking missions.
[95:34.16]I want to go start the mission.
[95:37.10]There.
[95:38.30]Good.
[95:38.50]You got the boat.
[95:39.46]Congratulations.
[95:40.60]Alright.
[95:46.77]Why did I just do that?
[95:48.37]I shouldn't have done that.
[95:49.03]I just skimmed him.
[95:57.76]Why is this one so much longer than the other ones?
[96:05.76]Okay, seriously?
[96:06.38]Honest to God?
[96:09.57]I shot that guy like three times in the head.
[96:15.43]I got so sick of talking to townspeople that I just fucked up the mission.
[96:18.41]Alright, where am I going?
[96:18.99]There's a boat over here.
[96:25.01]I'm gonna take a piss.
[96:27.17]Give me one minute.
[96:27.97]I'll be right back.
[96:28.61]I gotta pee.
[96:31.05]There.
[96:34.03]I need like a tea.
[96:35.03]Where's my tea break?
[96:37.39]I'm gonna change this to tea break.
[96:41.33]Yeah, I gotta pee.
[96:42.19]I'm gonna grab a drink.
[96:42.75]I'll be right back.
[100:21.49]Alright.
[100:22.57]Sorry.
[100:23.03]Wanted to grab a drink, too.
[100:27.34]Wanted to get a drink.
[100:27.94]You need to see a doctor if you're peeing for that much.
[100:32.44]Is that what you said?
[100:34.50]I don't think that's what you said, but that's how I interpreted it.
[100:37.91]Okay, let's keep going.
[100:40.83]Before I go, let's see if anything came in here.
[100:43.47]Gummy Monk for the $4 says, cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer.
[100:45.65]Well, that was rude and stupid.
[100:48.97]Thank you for the $4.
[100:51.84]Thank you also to the people that have been giving 100.
[100:53.24]You guys are awesome.
[100:54.72]And all the subs.
[100:57.60]But by the way, before I like burp into the microphone, I want to reiterate this again.
[101:04.03]Because there's a lot of people here now than there were earlier, like an hour ago.
[101:09.29]So break it down real quick before I start playing again.
[101:13.17]I'm going to change the way I think that I do sub notifications.
[101:17.70]I'm probably going to do something either halfway through a stream, I will stop for like a break.
[101:23.44]Or at the end of the stream, I'll do something where I can say everybody's name or something like that, because I haven't been able to keep up with it.
[101:30.51]It's something that I've been feeling bad about.
[101:33.53]And but at the same time, I want the stream to be...
[101:39.96]not focused on, like, reading names and having to stop, you know?
[101:43.04]Because, you know, when we get into, like, a bit, and we get into doing shit, and we get into doing something in a game, having to stop and just, you know, oh, hold on, let me, like, turn and, like, read some names, you know what I mean?
[101:54.91]It's getting hard for me to do that.
[101:56.77]And it's hard for me to pay attention.
[101:59.93]So... I'm gonna find some solution for it.
[102:03.88]But I do appreciate every single fucking person that subscribes to this channel.
[102:08.00]You continue to support this channel and you continue to let me do the things that I do.
[102:12.06]You know, it's fucking insane to me.
[102:13.46]Like, it's crazy that that many people potentially would want to support this channel.
[102:19.21]But we'll figure out something.
[102:20.21]I'm going to try to do like a happy medium.
[102:23.13]And we'll see what happens.
[102:24.95]But I just want to make sure I say that because the majority of the people that are going to be here are here.
[102:28.55]So might as well reiterate it again.
[102:32.03]But let's go.
[102:35.05]And close the map.
[102:36.21]What was I doing?
[102:37.15]I forget.
[102:37.49]I gotta kill the sniper.
[102:38.87]Easy.
[102:41.09]Kill the sniper.
[102:41.77]Easy.
[102:43.17]There's the sniper apparently.
[102:46.54]There's the sniper.
[102:48.72]Where?
[102:49.16]Oh, he's right there.
[102:51.26]Dude, what a good sniper.
[102:55.04]You did a great job.
[102:56.92]Oh, fuck.
[102:57.46]I screwed up to mission.
[102:58.56]I was supposed to kill that guy.
[103:06.94]What a good sniper.
[103:09.72]I thought that was going to be hard.
[103:10.80]That dude's like, seriously.
[103:19.89]That's the guy you're going to put up here to make sure that I don't get closer to the bad people?
[103:24.65]That's your solution.
[103:25.37]It was that guy.
[103:31.30]Can I like snap this guy's neck?
[103:33.60]Okay, we're going to go for a stealth neck snap.
[103:43.94]Stealth, next snap kill.
[103:58.31]Okay.
[104:07.91]Ah!
[104:15.27]That doesn't do anything.
[104:16.91]That doesn't do anything, guys.
[104:18.31]It doesn't do anything.
[104:22.84]Oh, that's a thumbnail.
[104:27.04]This thing is better than what I have.
[104:29.72]I'll take it.
[104:36.69]What's this?
[104:37.31]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[104:39.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[104:45.58]Oh, that boat.
[104:46.12]That boat right there.
[104:46.94]Where's it going?
[104:48.87]Where's it going?
[104:49.21]Come on.
[104:49.47]Come back.
[104:51.05]Oh, this is gonna be amazing.
[104:55.19]This boat.
[104:56.79]It's gonna come back around, right?
[104:58.79]We gotta wait for the boat.
[104:59.83]We have to.
[105:00.21]This guy's fucked.
[105:07.26]Hey, we're here to pick up the fishes.
[105:10.73]Oh, what a glorious day.
[105:13.17]I missed.
[105:14.35]I missed, but I'll get the captain.
[105:16.37]I'll get the captain.
[105:21.65]Oh.
[105:26.65]Oh.
[105:33.91]You are so bad at what you do.
[105:38.97]Did you get any worse at what you're supposed to be doing?
[105:40.69]That guy was playing a video game.
[105:44.59]He wasn't even trying to shoot me.
[105:45.59]That guy was playing a game.
[105:49.10]In fact, I'm not even sure that was a person.
[105:51.72]No, that's not a person.
[105:56.56]That was an android that they programmed.
[105:58.63]Oh god.
[105:59.13]Can I get in here?
[106:02.67]What am I supposed to do about that?
[106:08.42]I know about that, okay?
[106:10.60]That was an android.
[106:11.22]This game takes place in, like, the year, like, 30, 35.
[106:15.68]Because that was not a human being shooting me.
[106:23.08]Whatever, we're just gonna get up to the sniper tent.
[106:25.47]Sniper tent?
[106:26.07]Why is it a tent?
[106:33.22]And the fact that you can't walk over some of this terrain is fucking real dumb.
[106:38.83]Like, please.
[106:42.21]I can't, like, walk over that.
[106:53.90]Apparently didn't hit that guy in the hand in front of his face.
[106:58.14]Like, why can I not walk this way?
[107:00.10]Why can't I go this way?
[107:01.28]What the fuck?
[107:02.22]Why can't I not go in that water?
[107:04.62]Doesn't make any sense.
[107:06.22]What?
[107:08.60]I couldn't just walk that way.
[107:11.30]What a crock of shit.
[107:12.80]Really.
[107:18.51]I can't wait to just fucking push somebody off.
[107:20.13]This shit is exploding.
[107:42.73]A stupid asshole.
[107:47.65]Like... There's no reason why you would be that dumb.
[107:58.70]I just want... Come, somebody come over here.
[108:02.84]Come over here.
[108:03.84]No, fuck.
[108:10.57]Yeah, I do gotta get a rock.
[108:11.85]Fuck, I can't believe I messed that up.
[108:15.41]I had rocks and everything.
[108:16.89]Unbelievable.
[108:23.24]Alright, where's the sniper's radio?
[108:29.18]Is it this thing?
[108:30.06]What is it?
[108:34.00]Down here?
[108:34.41]There it is.
[108:37.59]Salad mask?
[108:40.42]I don't understand.
[108:41.02]Oh, it's a sound mask.
[108:44.66]Generator is okay.
[108:50.56]I'm looking for, like, the sniper's briefcase in here.
[108:55.31]Apparently there's just no briefcase, I guess.
[108:58.59]Find the sniper report.
[109:03.89]I don't see a fucking sniper report.
[109:09.72]How do I get up there?
[109:10.52]Oh my god, okay, I see.
[109:13.94]Don't worry, my sound was masked.
[109:24.69]I know, right?
[109:26.07]No, you fucking idiot.
[109:27.93]I didn't want to go that fast down.
[109:29.77]Dude, the same company that made fucking Gears of War.
[109:34.30]I can't believe I can't even make a good shimmy climbing system.
[109:42.18]Where's your report?
[109:50.42]World War II Assassin's Creed.
[109:55.90]Can I stuff this guy through the window?
[110:02.75]Yep.
[110:08.09]Alright.
[110:09.39]Did that give me any, like, intel?
[110:12.52]I guess we're gonna go this way.
[110:13.48]Find the partisan HQ, apparently.
[110:18.58]Yeah, you're telling me, like, the same company that made, like, Turok has a problem?
[110:33.57]Has a, like, huge problem with this shit?
[110:41.23]Can't find anything else.
[110:45.31]Well.
[110:51.09]Yeah, that's what I wanted you to do.
[110:52.91]In the middle of a firefight.
[110:54.43]I wanted you to climb up over that thing.
[111:04.20]Damn it.
[111:08.48]Got him.
[111:13.01]No, I gotta go kill the radio operator.
[111:19.43]I forgot about that dumbass.
[111:24.71]That didn't hit him.
[111:28.13]Why did that take so long to shoot him?
[111:31.91]I kind of want to just re-start that.
[111:33.81]This is just annoying me.
[111:37.36]I'm getting just annoyed right now.
[111:47.35]Didn't even know you could do that, okay.
[111:48.57]Let's go get rid of the radio operator.
[111:52.59]After I heal.
[111:57.56]They're using- Jerma, they're using trigonometry against you!
[112:02.38]I know, they gotta stop using this fucking trigonometry.
[112:08.05]These assholes with their calculus.
[112:19.15]Okay, I gotta get a double shot here.
[112:21.59]I've never done that before.
[112:22.73]Let's go for it.
[112:24.01]Double kill.
[112:30.35]God damn it.
[112:31.41]I had an opportunity.
[112:32.81]I still do.
[112:35.20]I still do.
[112:36.08]I still do!
[112:37.46]No, line up!
[112:52.67]Oh, what the fuck?
[112:54.69]I just wanted to get a cool double kill.
[112:57.15]And please reload my save when there's a guy fucking right... You know, do it again because that was stupid.
[113:10.84]So where did I shoot those guys?
[113:12.46]They didn't get hurt.
[113:13.26]That doesn't make any sense to me.
[113:20.40]I shot them through the chest and they're just like, oh, that hurt a little, I guess.
[113:24.78]That kind of hurt a little.
[113:33.51]Okay.
[113:37.07]Where's this other person that can see me?
[113:38.71]Are they on the road?
[113:44.65]Oh, fuck you guys.
[113:52.19]Such a bad save.
[113:54.05]This is an awful quick save.
[113:57.53]You'd think that the team that made fucking Mario Sunshine would have been able to figure this out by now.
[114:12.40]Just a little bit, just a little peek there.
[114:26.33]You know what I'm saying?
[114:32.07]Mario Sunshine didn't have checkpoints.
[114:35.45]Save it right here.
[114:36.15]I'm on Dickhead Island, wherever the hell I am right now.
[114:42.32]Let me make sure there's nobody that's gonna see me up there.
[114:49.22]Is that a camera?
[114:50.28]That's a fucking camera.
[114:53.08]Yep, gotta get rid of that fucking camera.
[115:08.31]What?
[115:10.92]What?
[115:11.84]That's just a stone eagle.
[115:17.80]This is my opportunity for a triple, right?
[115:26.80]Shit, this guy's coming over here.
[115:32.64]Wait, what?
[115:40.23]Oh, there goes my... There goes my chance.
[115:45.93]Bye-bye, bird.
[115:46.77]There's one guy right there.
[115:51.06]I want to line these guys up.
[115:52.68]Okay, let's go right there.
[115:53.62]That was a pretty cool slide, but I need to line you up and shoot the guy behind you, too.
[115:59.16]I have to do this.
[115:59.80]If I'm going to be like a streamer, I've got to get this.
[116:04.19]You know?
[116:05.61]So where is he?
[116:17.04]Alright, call your friend over.
[116:30.93]What the fuck?
[116:31.67]No, no, I thought it was a rock.
[116:33.47]Oh, I thought it was a rock.
[116:34.49]I thought it was the rock.
[116:38.09]No.
[116:39.51]No, I didn't know that thing even existed.
[116:43.73]I didn't know that even existed.
[116:45.29]What?
[116:46.11]There's a whistle?
[116:48.35]Oh, God.
[116:55.29]I wanted to throw a rock.
[117:00.50]Hey, yo, I'm over here.
[117:02.30]Hey!
[117:08.40]Okay.
[117:10.56]Go check that out.
[117:15.31]Line up.
[117:16.27]Line up like two good boys.
[117:20.55]Yeah, just make sure you stay over there.
[117:24.85]Get three of them.
[117:26.61]Come on.
[117:29.77]You know what would be really awesome?
[117:30.79]I just wanted to explain why they all turned around at the same time.
[117:36.84]And why they... What the fuck was that?
[117:43.66]What is happening right now?
[117:48.56]They all whipped around.
[117:50.99]A rock landed in front of them and they all whipped the fuck around.
[117:59.71]Please.
[118:00.01]Okay, here's my chance.
[118:00.63]Here's my chance.
[118:01.07]Here's my chance right here.
[118:09.22]No, I just shot the red suitcase.
[118:10.84]It's alright.
[118:13.10]It blew his hat off.
[118:19.50]It didn't even hurt his friend.
[118:27.13]Alright.
[118:27.89]Well, okay.
[118:30.51]No quad shot for me.
[118:38.21]Well, if somebody threw a rock at me, I'd be like, where did the rock come from?
[118:47.98]You'd think that after getting a rock thrown at you like three times, you'd be like, where's the rock coming from?
[118:54.36]Might be... Might be behind us.
[118:58.62]Because it is coming from that direction.
[119:06.90]Fucking seeing me right now.
[119:08.04]God damn.
[119:10.58]Where's this radio operator?
[119:11.56]Right here?
[119:16.71]I gotta get up there.
[119:18.39]Ah, shit.
[119:19.01]That's the guy with the radio, look.
[119:26.24]It's in his hand.
[119:27.28]No, that's a gun.
[119:27.74]I don't even know where I hit him.
[119:37.40]Right in the elbow.
[119:39.05]Ain't gonna be using that one for a while.
[119:40.23]And then your other friend that's just standing here.
[119:45.29]He's done too.
[119:50.51]Alright, we're good.
[119:51.57]Make the move.
[119:58.83]Can I smell what the rock is throwing?
[120:00.31]Dumbass.
[120:05.41]No, I'm gonna... One guy... Where's he?
[120:14.43]Up in the... Up there?
[120:19.28]What the fuck just happened?
[120:22.54]Was that guy there the whole time?
[120:27.76]Wait, bot check?
[120:28.78]What do you mean bot check?
[120:34.10]What do you mean bot check?
[120:42.15]I swear to god I didn't see that fucking guy.
[120:43.95]That guy didn't exist.
[120:44.69]Yeah, aim assist that one.
[120:53.90]I think I need aim assist.
[120:55.80]Won't even use it right here.
[120:57.97]Won't even fucking use it.
[120:58.97]Through the box.
[120:59.79]Through the tip of the skull.
[121:02.33]Got him.
[121:04.63]Oh, Germany needs aim assist.
[121:05.69]Germany needs aim assist.
[121:06.58]Oh yeah, that's two fucking bot kills in a row.
[121:09.16]Alright.
[121:13.78]Back where we were.
[121:14.74]We gotta kill the radio man.
[121:22.64]Where is he?
[121:24.46]Where's the radio guy?
[121:26.42]He was here.
[121:26.80]I can smell him.
[121:28.46]I can smell him.
[121:28.94]He's right here.
[121:29.44]I can smell him!
[121:31.42]I can smell him!
[121:46.17]Wait, what?
[121:49.79]At least they completed my mission.
[121:53.23]At least I completed my mission.
[121:55.38]What's this, a satchel?
[122:11.75]Traded.
[122:23.51]I'm not supposed to be fucking around.
[122:24.76]I'm not supposed to be fucking around, but I am.
[122:26.14]I wish one of you would investigate it.
[122:53.76]Where is it coming from?
[122:59.28]How does he still know?
[123:00.14]Oh, he knows now.
[123:03.69]Now he knows.
[123:04.87]Okay, fuck.
[123:05.97]Come on.
[123:08.75]What the?
[123:09.18]What?
[123:15.47]Over and out, my friend.
[123:17.19]Over and out.
[123:19.55]Why did it attack me right here?
[123:22.88]Why did it put me here?
[123:26.02]Why?
[123:26.62]What the fuck?
[123:27.32]How is this a checkpoint?
[123:29.36]How is this a fucking checkpoint?
[123:33.56]That's not a checkpoint.
[123:35.80]That's right in front of an enemy.
[123:37.18]Jesus.
[123:54.88]Fuck the sniper rifle.
[124:08.36]We don't even need it.
[124:09.44]Where is he?
[124:16.98]Okay.
[124:18.08]We don't even need the sniper rifle.
[124:22.38]Over and out, my friend.
[124:24.07]Okay, good.
[124:31.57]Reload my shit.
[124:35.01]Now.
[124:36.53]Find the partisan or search the graveyard.
[124:41.21]Let's go to the graveyard.
[124:44.12]No.
[124:44.94]We're like right there anyways.
[124:46.04]Let's investigate that.
[124:49.78]I'm going to put a scope on my knife so I can really see where it's going.
[125:07.69]These guys are always in such odd positions.
[125:10.43]Seriously, do you have to be in such weird places?
[125:14.90]This will come in very useful.
[125:16.24]Yeah, this will come in very useful.
[125:29.12]I love punching people so hard in the face that they die.
[125:39.43]Boom.
[125:41.57]Gotta get my aim assist knife.
[125:42.85]Yeah, that would work.
[125:46.61]So let's get out of there.
[125:47.37]I don't want to be seen by anybody.
[125:48.91]Let's chill here for just a second.
[125:52.31]So I can see these people up here.
[125:59.59]I don't see anyone.
[126:05.41]Oh, somebody's over there.
[126:06.61]Somebody's over there.
[126:09.61]Huh?
[126:12.88]Nobody even spotted me and I got shot by someone.
[126:14.78]What the hell is this game talking about?
[126:18.84]Oh, it's this guy.
[126:23.54]Go visit a dentist, you prick.
[126:27.76]Go see the local dentist.
[126:33.77]Damn it.
[126:34.03]I was trying to get him right in the ass.
[126:45.39]I twisted my ankle.
[126:46.39]Okay.
[126:52.43]So... There's that way, or I could go this way.
[126:56.43]I know.
[126:57.99]That's what I'm looking for.
[127:00.47]Looking for HQ.
[127:07.12]Hold on.
[127:08.32]I gotta kill this guy without anyone knowing.
[127:18.95]Success!
[127:20.61]Success.
[127:24.43]He stopped right... I love that it's scripted.
[127:26.57]I was supposed to do a melee kill to you, so you have to stop.
[127:39.37]Something's blinking over here.
[127:40.11]What's that?
[127:40.37]A satchel?
[127:41.91]Taking it.
[127:42.99]One mine.
[127:45.44]It's not here.
[127:45.94]I just heard a shot.
[127:57.37]Who just shot me?
[127:58.79]Did you guys hear that?
[128:06.29]I hear a shot.
[128:07.83]Somebody's shooting at me from somewhere.
[128:12.82]Am I crazy?
[128:13.54]I don't think I'm crazy.
[128:17.04]I keep hearing a sniper shot.
[128:22.36]Where is he?
[128:22.72]I have no idea.
[128:26.32]Well, here it is.
[128:26.86]Let's climb up to the top first.
[128:28.72]Let's get a better view.
[128:32.85]Some motherfucker's throwing a rock at me.
[128:39.39]Okay, I love how I have to locate the HQ and I'm currently inside of it.
[128:42.21]Am I not?
[128:46.98]I'm fairly certain I'm inside HQ.
[128:54.54]Like, really, game?
[128:56.50]Like, I thought that's what I'm... I have to, like, go stand in front?
[129:00.34]This is like a Tomb Raider game?
[129:03.48]Well, I... Okay.
[129:04.96]Okay.
[129:12.39]Well, that's dumb.
[129:17.27]I gotta use some help here to locate HQ.
[129:34.94]Why did I lose it on my minimap?
[129:43.34]It's right there.
[129:47.22]This better not kill me.
[129:49.18]Don't fucking kill me.
[129:53.13]That's no.
[129:57.15]I want to jump to here.
[129:59.17]No!
[130:05.41]This doesn't make any sense.
[130:10.35]I found HQ.
[130:11.31]I found it.
[130:18.45]Give me the trench gun.
[130:20.97]There's a lot of stuff in here.
[130:28.93]Is this just like a shotgun?
[130:35.18]What is going on outside?
[130:40.29]Why did the house just explode?
[130:49.39]That can't be how it happened.
[130:55.66]Okay.
[130:58.02]So, my satchel charges?
[131:02.50]What's the objective now?
[131:04.26]Get to Sophia in the castle.
[131:07.61]Sophia has gone to the Jerma-occupied castle.
[131:09.27]Sounds like there are different ways in.
[131:10.71]She said she was going to close the doors to stop any more Germans getting in.
[131:13.83]So I'm probably going to need the satchel charges I found with the letter.
[131:17.47]You got it.
[131:19.19]I'm just going to blow the door open.
[131:20.39]Why are there so many... There's rifle ammo and shit.
[131:23.63]Okay.
[131:24.81]Alright, let's go.
[131:30.87]Save the game right here.
[131:34.46]And, I mean, there are people...
[131:49.80]You shouldn't have let me shot like this.
[131:51.79]I shot him point blank and missed.
[131:53.45]Alright, both of us were at fault there.
[131:55.37]See, he didn't see me.
[131:56.33]He didn't see the guy with the shotgun walking up the stairs.
[131:59.69]And I missed him point blank with his shotgun.
[132:02.61]So we were both at fault.
[132:04.45]Not a big deal.
[132:05.67]Both of us could have done that a little bit better.
[132:09.00]For sure.
[132:19.22]I do some healing.
[132:20.14]I got heals.
[132:21.48]Do it.
[132:22.64]Oh, I have a second.
[132:29.08]I wear it.
[132:34.25]Quick scope.
[132:38.79]Oh!
[132:38.93]Jesus.
[132:50.42]How did I miss that?
[132:56.79]Nice, like, reaction streamer.
[132:59.55]Whoa!
[133:03.19]What can I do?
[133:03.85]Can I do anything with cars?
[133:07.83]This seriously, honest to God, reminds me of Mortal Kombat 10.
[133:13.05]Like smashing all those just horrible explosive faces.
[133:17.09]This is Mortal Kombat.
[133:18.41]This ain't even Sniper Elite.
[133:19.39]Alright, how do I... Just get up this way again?
[133:22.02]Okay.
[133:27.08]Here's the door.
[133:27.62]I blow this door with the satchel.
[133:29.04]Alright, just in case something fucking bad happens here.
[133:31.96]Alright, blow the door with the satchel, place satchel, charge.
[133:38.53]Add timer to satchel, charge.
[133:40.96]Okay.
[133:42.32]And then I just gotta get away.
[133:49.44]And it's gonna explode.
[133:54.26]Easy.
[134:01.44]Who are these people?
[134:08.05]Uh-oh.
[134:09.61]The double cross.
[134:12.01]The double cross for the cutscene we skipped.
[134:13.45]Ugh, the hell?
[134:14.43]So why did that mission take so much longer than the tutorial mission?
[134:45.51]Felt like that was much easier than the first one.
[134:53.01]Alright, let's continue.
[134:55.67]I got six bucks.
[134:57.41]Six dollars, guys.
[134:58.07]You know what that means.
[135:00.55]Okay.
[135:01.03]Damage.
[135:01.99]Stability.
[135:02.53]Max zoom.
[135:05.34]Bolt action.
[135:06.08]Bolt action.
[135:09.26]Recoil dampening.
[135:10.60]Which one do I want?
[135:12.84]This one's just so much damage.
[135:15.72]Magazine size, rig stability, max zoom.
[135:17.86]I mean, look at this thing.
[135:20.82]What do you think?
[135:23.22]Rate of fire.
[135:26.43]Dude.
[135:28.81]Should I just get the rate of fire one?
[135:31.17]The semi-automatic?
[135:41.09]I mean, I'm looking at the Gyuhir.
[135:44.13]I think that one, I'm looking forward to using that one.
[135:51.93]Oh, what's like the biggest damage?
[135:53.27]Like that thing is insane.
[135:55.98]Keep an eye on that one.
[135:58.90]And these are DLC.
[136:00.04]So, you know, that's not fair.
[136:02.93]The Carcano.
[136:05.03]The Gewar.
[136:06.69]The Carbonear.
[136:08.70]I think it's the Carcano.
[136:14.70]Either the Carcano or the Moist Nugget.
[136:22.98]What do you think?
[136:23.92]Moist Nugget?
[136:28.85]Magazine size 5.
[136:31.79]Yeah, damage really doesn't matter.
[136:33.47]You know what?
[136:33.77]Fuck it.
[136:34.01]We're going with the... We're going with this one.
[136:40.68]We're just gonna... Why not just spam?
[136:42.66]You know what I mean?
[136:43.64]Five bucks.
[136:47.98]We're going with the semi-automatic sniper rifle.
[136:50.41]It's already done, guys.
[136:51.11]Too late.
[136:58.15]It's too late.
[137:00.58]We picked up the gogurt.
[137:07.96]Alright, these ones are three bucks.
[137:08.92]Anything for one dollar?
[137:12.76]Anything for one dollar?
[137:15.18]Nope.
[137:19.37]Can I upgrade any of this stuff?
[137:21.09]No.
[137:23.69]I haven't even used the pistol once.
[137:25.41]Alright, we got the gogurt.
[137:29.09]Skill tree.
[137:32.05]Maximum heart rate or stabilis... Stabilis... Stabilize, Jeremy.
[137:37.43]Heart rate slightly faster.
[137:39.56]I want this one.
[137:40.30]Max heart rate.
[137:43.56]Okay.
[137:45.06]Let's do it.
[137:46.66]Yep, I got the gumdrop gun.
[137:54.10]But... Thank you, Yarek, for the three bucks.
[137:57.59]Nice work on the mission so far.
[137:58.71]Here's another three dollars.
[138:01.41]Thanks, dude.
[138:04.20]Okay, here come the cutscenes.
[138:05.60]Another cutscene.
[138:06.66]We gotta talk to these people.
[138:10.54]You did well to find me.
[138:11.68]Wait, what?
[138:13.52]So it was a test.
[138:14.82]To see if I'm... You want to say that you're the best?
[138:16.97]Well, thanks, man.
[138:17.79]Appreciate the three months.
[138:19.01]Our people were about to be executed.
[138:21.69]Stability.
[138:23.21]Stability.
[138:25.47]How's the tea?
[138:25.89]Tea's good.
[138:26.49]Is that what you want?
[138:28.43]Funny, funny, funny.
[138:30.19]Try me.
[138:32.26]Very well.
[138:34.66]I don't care.
[138:40.70]Out of any game I've played in the last probably five years, this is the least I would care about a story.
[138:44.91]Okay.
[138:45.63]Like, out of any game, this is the one I would consider to be like a game that I would just skip every single cutscene.
[138:59.98]For instance.
[139:00.62]Like I said my name and then we were done.
[139:04.14]That guy said my name and we were done.
[139:12.77]See, I said my name in a different way.
[139:16.91]And it was over.
[139:17.41]Okay.
[139:24.74]Let's just start the mission.
[139:28.69]I was gonna drill for a joke there.
[139:30.77]If you could run off the edge.
[139:31.93]But you can't.
[139:33.01]No fun allowed in this game, apparently.
[139:43.76]I have to, like, pee again.
[139:45.02]What is wrong with me?
[139:45.68]Because I'm drinking, like, coffee.
[139:53.28]I can't even skip it.
[139:53.84]It won't let me skip.
[139:55.55]I'm going to pee my pants.
[139:59.67]Whatever.
[140:01.09]Find the downed American pilot.
[140:04.43]Find the crashed up... We have to eventually wreck the railway gun.
[140:08.00]Let's find the American pilot.
[140:11.50]Let's try that first.
[140:13.16]Let's take a look at this weapon and see.
[140:14.56]I like it.
[140:16.82]It's cool.
[140:17.77]Looks alright.
[140:18.31]We're going to make our way that way.
[140:22.03]Let's go.
[140:25.56]Just pee in a bottle?
[140:26.84]What am I, the Schneider?
[140:30.51]And then it's gonna go... That's loud enough to disguise my rifle fire.
[140:52.70]Where is this fucking guy?
[140:53.70]I'm getting bored.
[140:54.54]I'm getting bored of this mission already.
[140:55.84]Okay, finally, some action.
[141:12.33]Finally, some fucking action.
[141:15.45]Take out the binoculars.
[141:20.81]Tag him.
[141:23.95]Anybody else?
[141:25.97]In the vicinity.
[141:27.69]Let's give this new weapon a try.
[141:36.45]Mmm, right to the brain matter.
[141:41.20]Anybody else?
[141:42.06]Ooh, there was another guy here.
[141:44.42]That's going to get him right in his back.
[141:45.88]Right to the spine.
[141:46.58]Come on.
[141:46.94]Spine shot.
[141:49.66]Oh, through the heart.
[141:52.51]Hey, yeah.
[141:54.29]Shot through the heart.
[141:56.49]And I'm the one to blame, you know?
[141:58.25]You give love a bad fucking name, boys and girls!
[142:03.63]We make jokes.
[142:04.27]You know, we make jokes on this stream.
[142:08.31]If you're new, we make jokes.
[142:10.55]Like, for instance, check this one out.
[142:12.66]This one's for free.
[142:14.82]This one's for free.
[142:27.70]Hold on.
[142:30.12]This one's for free.
[142:33.35]Hey, you know these jokes?
[142:34.99]You don't even gotta pay for this one.
[142:41.63]Hey, you don't even gotta pay for this joke.
[142:46.52]This is important, hold on.
[142:54.90]You don't even gotta pay for this one!
[142:58.32]Oh, come on!
[142:59.08]Grind up his body!
[143:03.24]What?
[143:03.56]Come on!
[143:06.85]What the fuck?
[143:17.83]Come on!
[143:18.38]No!
[143:22.34]I'm telling you, you're not gonna have to pay for this one.
[143:24.72]I promise.
[143:39.20]Okay.
[143:39.70]Oh, come on.
[143:40.34]Everybody just get out of here.
[143:41.50]I'm trying to do something.
[143:42.50]Oh, my God.
[143:52.99]I just want to get rid of these people so I can make my funny joke.
[143:56.01]That's all I want to do.
[144:02.05]Instantly teleported.
[144:02.89]Okay, here we go.
[144:04.75]This one's for free.
[144:08.42]I don't want you guys to have to pay for this one.
[144:10.28]You know?
[144:22.64]This one's gonna be free.
[144:24.40]I promise you, this one will be free.
[144:31.10]Can somebody... Can somebody please, like, just stay on top of this?
[144:39.92]I wanna walk like forward at this, not like diagonal.
[144:42.34]Here we go.
[144:46.22]Nice, here we go.
[144:49.03]Alright, good.
[144:51.65]I wish I could pick up the hammer.
[144:52.67]Here we go, this is the joke, you ready?
[145:01.72]Hey Margaret, are you almost ready, done with the school lunches?
[145:09.55]You get it?
[145:09.91]Like, these people are the people who are going to be at school lunch.
[145:13.63]That one was free.
[145:34.08]Beer.
[145:38.05]That was a free joke.
[145:39.25]That one wasn't... You didn't have to pay for that one.
[145:42.23]You didn't have to pay for that one.
[145:43.77]What is this?
[145:45.95]What is that?
[145:47.41]What's that noise?
[146:00.11]I didn't even know!
[146:00.75]How was I supposed to know?
[146:04.24]Wait a minute.
[146:04.76]I just got like a...
[146:09.49]Oh shit, there's a sniper.
[146:24.95]Where's the sniper?
[146:25.91]Fucking Jesus.
[146:29.97]These guys are more coordinated?
[146:31.19]Okay.
[146:31.85]That's good to know.
[146:34.57]Good, you can be as coordinated as you want.
[146:35.99]Ain't gonna fucking make it out of this one.
[146:42.24]You know, I really did a good job today.
[146:56.13]Why did that guy explode?
[146:57.15]I didn't know there were explosive people in this game.
[147:14.13]Take his gun.
[147:18.06]I see him!
[147:19.80]Well, I don't see you, so... Well, there you are.
[147:26.66]Almost out of ammo.
[147:32.47]Yeah, fine, that's... Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, what?
[147:37.27]Why the fuck are you guys not coordinating?
[147:55.22]That ghost thing keeps freaking me the fuck out.
[147:56.98]It really does.
[148:02.96]Where?
[148:03.81]He's, like, right there somewhere.
[148:06.05]Asshole.
[148:18.86]For the love of God, just dive!
[148:21.63]Oh shit.
[148:22.13]Oh shit.
[148:22.41]Oh shit.
[148:22.69]Oh shit.
[148:22.97]Oh shit.
[148:23.25]Oh shit.
[148:24.07]Oh shit.
[148:24.33]Is it coming behind me too?
[148:25.44]Guy coming behind me.
[148:31.18]What?
[148:32.30]Wait.
[148:33.46]That guy was dead?
[148:34.98]That guy was already dead?
[148:37.56]Wow!
[148:41.54]What the fuck?
[148:42.14]How are you alive, dude?
[148:45.44]This guy was standing on a grenade.
[148:52.46]I have to... I can't really fuck around right now.
[149:02.36]What is that?
[149:03.48]I don't even know.
[149:05.00]Some type of achievement.
[149:08.58]Okay, now this... There's a pilot in here somewhere.
[149:11.04]I need to find.
[149:16.00]Wow, these guys are more coordinated.
[149:24.94]Just gotta sneak over here without being seen to look inside of this pilot thing.
[149:31.29]This plane.
[149:35.69]This pilot thing.
[149:37.19]It's a plane, Jeremy.
[149:38.95]Jeremy, it's a plane.
[149:39.95]I have to destroy it?
[149:41.35]Destroy the plane.
[149:42.39]Oh, easy.
[149:46.39]Easy.
[149:47.21]Destroy the plane.
[149:48.04]You got it.
[149:55.33]It didn't do anything.
[150:08.07]Right.
[150:08.79]Okay.
[150:10.41]Right.
[150:11.29]Destroy the... Find the downed American pilot.
[150:15.57]Destroy the plane.
[150:28.26]Am I missing something here?
[150:29.76]Or what?
[150:32.52]I have to be missing something.
[150:46.24]Destroy the plane.
[150:48.88]How am I supposed to destroy this plane?
[150:55.70]Oh my fucking god, please.
[150:59.15]Alright, that's great.
[151:01.45]I had to go to the other side of the plane to blow it up.
[151:04.91]There's only one side of the plane you can put a satchel charge.
[151:06.98]I can't do it anywhere else.
[151:08.62]This guy's dead.
[151:14.04]I can't put the satchel charge on the other side of the plane?
[151:24.22]No, that was an officer.
[151:24.92]Okay.
[151:25.71]Well, I'm in trouble.
[151:32.97]So now what?
[151:35.39]Now we gotta locate the pilot.
[151:37.13]So, pilot now needs to be found.
[151:38.57]Let me heal.
[151:47.05]Everybody knows only one side of a plane is sticky enough.
[151:52.10]Dayntech, thank you for the $5.
[151:53.42]Didn't pay for that joke and I want my money back.
[151:56.04]No refunds.
[151:58.46]No refunds.
[152:02.18]That guy got electrocuted.
[152:09.33]Oh no, my cover's blown to the one guy that won't fucking die.
[152:12.69]Okay, let's go.
[152:15.39]I need ammo.
[152:17.31]When I search these guys for ammo, I'm desperate right now.
[152:26.84]Was it ammo?
[152:29.90]If it's not ammo, then I don't care.
[152:31.06]There we go.
[152:34.60]Okay, I have two shots.
[152:37.43]That's not a lot.
[152:38.99]I need to read the terms and conditions with this weapon.
[152:51.81]I need to, like, steal a weapon from somebody.
[152:54.51]You know, there probably was somebody that had one, but I'm... I'm not going back.
[153:05.91]I ain't going back in there, so, you know, whatever.
[153:07.83]Let's get our rock.
[153:09.35]What is this?
[153:11.24]Bandage.
[153:12.70]Okay.
[153:14.10]I'll get our rock ready.
[153:17.68]Low on BMO.
[153:21.00]Get the all clear.
[153:25.41]Find... Where did that... What happened?
[153:32.33]What is it?
[153:32.63]Supposed to find somebody here?
[153:36.15]Find the downed American pilot.
[153:37.33]Oh.
[153:38.09]I need to... I want his weapon.
[153:45.35]I love how you're coming this way.
[153:47.19]You're so dumb.
[153:49.71]Did you...
[153:59.83]That was so uncalled for.
[154:03.87]Everything okay over there, Mike?
[154:06.07]Oh, I don't hear anything.
[154:07.83]I'll throw a grenade over to where you were standing.
[154:22.44]Alright, and who has a sniper rifle?
[154:24.96]What do you got?
[154:28.50]No, we don't have anything.
[154:30.05]What's that?
[154:36.93]Search him.
[154:44.49]Jerma, please think about the consequences of your actions.
[154:51.96]I am thinking about the consequences, and the consequences are...
[154:56.02]I need to find the pilot.
[154:57.86]Under any means necessary.
[154:59.00]There's a bunch of bad guys here.
[155:08.22]Watch this one.
[155:14.33]Shit.
[155:27.44]I'll play Ring Around the Rosie all day.
[155:28.78]You came in the house.
[155:29.40]I didn't think you came in the house.
[155:33.02]I did not think he came in the house.
[155:41.09]Alright, now I got some ammo.
[155:41.81]I'm trying to read this chat created content because I can't think of anything else.
[155:53.12]What?
[155:54.94]I just read it.
[156:00.25]This pilot apparently is right here.
[156:02.05]I'm not sure where the fuck he is, but I guess he's right there.
[156:04.97]And I guess there's somebody fucking shooting at me from across the way.
[156:07.21]I don't know who it is.
[156:12.12]And I gotta pee.
[156:12.88]I haven't peed.
[156:17.32]Can I, like, pause the game to pee?
[156:20.32]Because I'm going to pee my pants.
[156:22.18]I shot a guy through the wood.
[156:30.33]easy once I get a second I have to pee alright that guy exploded too good grenade shot okay heal no pausing allowed damn it almost out of ammo
[157:05.63]Alright, I'm going to pee.
[157:06.65]I'm going to sit right here.
[157:07.27]If I die, I die.
[157:08.23]I have to pee bad.
[157:09.40]Be right back.
[160:32.07]See?
[160:33.33]Still alive.
[160:36.17]Still alive.
[160:39.55]You guys thought I was gonna fucking die.
[160:41.94]Nope!
[160:45.92]Sorry, I'm eating like a snack.
[160:52.64]Wait!
[160:58.61]It took that guy that long to come around the house.
[161:07.68]Literally, that guy was... How long has that guy been standing there for?
[161:10.10]Don't fucking move, huh?
[161:19.65]What?
[161:20.29]I just dropped my chocolate bar.
[161:23.91]He was there for three minutes.
[161:30.49]Wait, he came around like eight times?
[161:44.28]I'm a fucking idiot.
[162:01.93]Oh my god that's fucking awesome.
[162:07.42]I'm so glad.
[162:15.47]Don't move.
[162:23.23]Watch the clip.
[162:24.61]Let me see.
[162:26.69]Hold on, let me see this clip.
[162:33.06]I'm watching it.
[162:34.68]Fuck, hold on.
[162:36.52]Shit!
[162:36.92]No, no, no, no!
[162:37.56]I'm watching a clip!
[162:38.36]Fuck!
[162:40.24]There he is.
[162:41.04]There he is.
[162:42.14]There he is.
[162:52.83]Holy shit, that's so stupid.
[162:55.75]I should've died, like, fucking ten times.
[162:59.33]Ugh.
[163:01.38]Well, whatever.
[163:07.00]I'm right here anyways, who cares?
[163:08.28]Alright, where do I need to go?
[163:12.57]Wreck the railway gun.
[163:18.05]Where's the pilot?
[163:19.93]There's apparently a pilot over here.
[163:21.09]Alright, don't fuck this up.
[163:22.39]Oh my god, really?
[163:28.94]Back in here, pick this up, whatever it is.
[163:34.14]He's giving me four new objectives.
[163:35.40]What the hell is that?
[163:43.31]Okay.
[163:43.85]There's a car up there.
[163:48.27]Watch out for the car that's in there.
[163:52.39]Are you fucking serious?
[163:55.25]You're so bad.
[163:59.40]Wait, I'm still taking a tea break.
[164:00.48]I'll get it off the screen.
[164:08.45]This guy has to die.
[164:09.19]He's gonna cause a problem I already know.
[164:11.25]I'm gonna get him, like, right in his toe.
[164:16.41]Come on, where's, like, the toe shot?
[164:18.45]Where's, like, the one where it, like, zooms in and, like, his foot exploding?
[164:31.10]I'm wasting ammo on that, but you know what, who cares.
[164:34.74]And I didn't even hit him with that.
[164:36.80]We gotta get some good pistol shots here.
[164:43.63]Nice.
[164:49.45]This guy's getting attacked by bees.
[164:56.29]Call me a coward, that's fine.
[164:58.22]I'm gonna be an alive coward, that's for sure.
[165:09.43]I need fucking ammo.
[165:10.52]How did I waste all that ammo?
[165:13.92]I've never had an ammo problem in any of the two missions I've played.
[165:16.66]Now I do, apparently?
[165:17.48]Whatever.
[165:26.69]Coward.
[165:27.73]Coward!
[165:32.71]Coward!
[165:33.11]You guys think I'm a coward?
[165:39.33]Would a coward be able to do this?
[165:40.39]I don't think so.
[165:50.68]Would a coward be able to do this?
[165:52.12]Hold on.
[165:53.46]There's a person sleeping in here.
[165:55.74]Oh, wow.
[165:55.92]This is going to be insane.
[165:56.80]There's two people sleeping in here.
[165:58.42]The body of the pilot from the crashed plane.
[166:01.33]You need to grab that film canister.
[166:05.13]This footage could be invaluable.
[166:07.47]Oh boy, I... Oh boy.
[166:12.47]Ooh.
[166:14.67]Ooh.
[166:16.17]Okay.
[166:17.86]Uh, right.
[166:18.72]So what the hell did that even do?
[166:23.08]What was the point of doing that?
[166:26.08]Just go wreck the railway gun?
[166:35.62]Can I just destroy?
[166:37.02]Do I need to do any of this?
[166:37.92]Can I just go destroy the railway gun?
[166:40.94]I feel like I can.
[166:41.68]You know what?
[166:43.30]Fuck it.
[166:43.68]We're doing a speedrun.
[166:46.99]I'm just going to place charge.
[166:48.67]I can't have... Just do it.
[166:50.37]What am I waiting for?
[166:51.01]Why am I doing these side missions for no reason?
[166:56.25]Somebody's flashing me.
[166:57.79]Oh.
[166:58.80]It's another sniper.
[167:00.28]Okay.
[167:00.42]You want to play that game?
[167:03.02]Oh, I can play that game.
[167:07.39]In a minute I can play that game, but not like right now.
[167:09.45]Just give me a second.
[167:22.18]I can play that game.
[167:25.34]Woo, peekaboo!
[167:27.88]Right through the barrel.
[167:29.02]Through the barrel.
[167:30.00]I just did the thing that they did in Overwatch.
[167:32.64]I just did the thing that happened in Overwatch.
[167:35.15]You can just call me Mercy.
[167:36.95]No, what's her name?
[167:42.74]Where is it?
[167:43.10]I don't know where they are.
[167:58.29]It's right there.
[168:06.25]No.
[168:07.21]No.
[168:07.73]Where are you?
[168:11.61]Okay.
[168:23.59]That was so sloppy.
[168:30.88]Why are you still alive?
[168:41.76]God!
[168:44.96]I can't go this way.
[168:47.16]I can't fucking go this way.
[168:48.26]I need to wrap around or something.
[168:50.82]This guy right here, you're fucking dead, buddy.
[169:01.28]Pull out the binoculars, for real.
[169:11.67]Somebody's still shooting me.
[169:16.75]I just gotta get to the end.
[169:19.51]Well, that was the guy that was shooting at me.
[169:20.75]And here comes a guy down here.
[169:23.28]Like, no ammo in any gun.
[169:24.52]This sucks.
[169:26.34]And... I swear to God, I'm gonna fucking scream.
[169:30.56]I'm going to scream out loud.
[169:34.42]We have to go this way.
[169:36.34]No more fucking around.
[169:37.22]We have to go down here.
[169:39.07]And, like...
[169:44.52]Don't kill me.
[169:45.28]Don't kill me.
[169:45.76]Don't kill me.
[169:46.18]Don't kill me.
[169:47.52]Oh, thank God.
[169:48.26]Okay, keep going.
[169:53.82]Can I go this way?
[169:57.58]No, that's a bad move.
[169:59.66]Very bad move.
[170:00.43]I'm going to wrap around.
[170:09.31]I wonder where this tunnel leads.
[170:16.54]alright two shots what is up there they don't know where I am keep going around can I keep going this way yeah okay keep going Kim wants spaghetti
[170:41.14]We can make some spaghetti.
[170:42.40]We have a version of spaghetti we can make.
[170:45.51]It's called Kraft Macaroni and Cheese out of the box.
[170:48.57]And we can put red sauce on it instead of cheese and we can just pretend it's spaghetti.
[170:54.93]Actually, I think I actually do have spaghetti.
[170:58.52]So scratch that.
[171:00.54]Scratch that.
[171:00.94]We...
[171:09.84]Alright, ammo conserving.
[171:11.04]Ammo conserving.
[171:18.07]Save as much ammo as possible.
[171:19.61]Because I'm going to need another two shots.
[171:23.54]That was a good shot.
[171:28.10]You guys want to try to make fun of me.
[171:34.47]Huh?
[171:36.81]What was that?
[171:38.41]Why did that need a cutscene?
[171:41.01]They needed to have a cutscene for that, apparently.
[171:45.41]They're doing all kinds of arm motions.
[171:49.29]Here they come, I guess.
[172:07.49]Not this one dude up there.
[172:09.79]Okay, I need to use the sniper right there.
[172:14.10]Is there a guy up there too?
[172:16.66]Not that I can tell.
[172:17.44]This guy's casting secret Nazi radio spells.
[172:28.54]Alright, so far so good.
[172:31.46]Not so far so good.
[172:33.62]Where are you?
[172:42.34]I made you bite your tongue.
[172:44.62]I made that guy bite.
[172:45.48]No, I didn't even shoot that guy.
[172:47.10]I scared that guy so much that he bit through his tongue and through his jaw.
[172:58.02]I'm going to ruin the house.
[172:59.32]Wait, what do you mean you're going to ruin the house if you don't get spaghetti?
[173:05.06]You'll get it.
[173:05.47]Don't worry.
[173:08.05]You'll get spaghetti.
[173:08.67]Don't worry.
[173:11.06]I'm speaking spaghetti.
[173:12.59]Watch this guy turn into fucking spaghetti.
[173:16.49]Of course you have to make a fucking not funny joke and die.

[174:00.16]What the fuck?
[174:01.50]Oh, okay, good.
[174:03.10]I'm going in here.
[174:03.66]It wants me to place a charge in here for some reason.
[174:13.48]Those are side objectives.
[174:15.30]Yeah, we ain't doing no side objective, guys.
[174:17.86]Sorry, you ain't gonna get that today.
[174:20.84]You ain't gonna get any side objectives.
[174:26.61]That wasn't a headshot for him.
[174:30.01]I'm such a vet.
[174:30.97]I gotta, like, just get out of here.
[174:32.11]I'm surrounded at all sides.
[174:36.23]Just get over here.

[175:00.00]I can't deal with that guy right now.

[175:03.03]I don't have any health kits either.
[175:08.58]So fucking much trouble, much trouble.
[175:13.08]He's still alive.
[175:16.28]How could you still be fucking standing after getting shot in the face with a sniper rifle?
[175:23.30]Like legit shot that guy in his mouth with a sniper.
[175:26.56]And he just went, oh, oh, that kind of hurt.
[175:29.20]Good thing I'm okay.
[175:31.20]I'm going to continue to sit and still and fire at you.
[175:46.96]The reinforcements... Okay, so he called in the reinforcements and they're never... I'm so angry.
[175:58.33]I could have shot that guy, but... Dude, these quicksaves are really going to give me fucking diarrhea.
[176:21.38]Man, what are you guys even doing?
[176:23.32]You know what I mean?
[176:26.72]Like, what the fuck?
[176:29.24]Like, my cover is just already blown every time I restart the checkpoint.
[176:33.63]Every time.
[176:44.23]There's nothing.
[176:44.91]I just gotta, like, I gotta do it the way that I gotta do it like a fucking, like a champion.
[176:48.78]You know what I mean?
[176:51.97]We have to restart that checkpoint and I have to run around.
[176:54.61]Because I'm always going to have red markers everywhere.
[176:58.21]Ray, restart that checkpoint.
[177:01.84]Well, never mind.
[177:02.66]Now we started even worse.
[177:05.18]Oh, okay, great.
[177:05.92]Let me restart the checkpoint.
[177:09.02]Just put me in an even worse fucking position.
[177:11.37]Why the fuck are you doing this to me?
[177:20.75]This shit ain't even a checkpoint!
[177:23.21]You know what I see as a checkpoint?
[177:24.41]Like, starting where you know that you're gonna be fine.
[177:28.13]At least initially.
[177:30.23]Give me a break!
[177:35.83]And now I gotta wait- Okay.
[177:48.39]Where is he?
[177:49.52]There's like three guys over here.
[177:50.86]There's one.
[177:58.82]You know what?
[177:59.30]I also love how nobody fucking does a damn thing.
[178:02.63]Literally nobody fucking can play this game if you stand still.
[178:05.49]The second I like move, everybody all of a sudden knows what to do.
[178:09.91]Look at these dots.
[178:12.29]They're the ghosts from fucking Super Mario Brothers.
[178:15.93]If I turn around and start moving, all of a sudden they all know what to do.
[178:21.73]Let me turn and walk over here.
[178:23.43]And see if the boos chase me.
[178:25.85]Because look, you've got this fucking guy still just like, Oh, yeah, I'm going to aim over this way.
[178:29.96]No, he's not turned.
[178:30.70]He's not facing me.
[178:32.50]I can now run at him.
[178:37.88]Fuck off.
[178:46.15]Wild Guns got remade for the PS4?
[178:47.77]Did it really?
[178:49.07]No more to find here.
[178:50.77]That would be actually pretty awesome to play.
[178:52.93]I would stream that.
[178:56.75]No, hold on.
[178:57.47]The boos are coming.
[178:59.82]My back was turned for like three seconds.
[179:01.44]Here come like nine people.
[179:05.12]God.
[179:12.16]Come on, you fucking dumb asshole.
[179:14.52]Nope.
[179:15.34]Standing still.
[179:18.78]There's one guy.
[179:19.42]Because my back is... Nope.
[179:20.54]We're gonna freeze.
[179:21.46]Everyone's gonna freeze.
[179:23.15]They know I'm in this building.
[179:24.23]They will not come over here.
[179:26.53]I have to move over here for them to understand what's happening.
[179:29.69]No.
[179:30.05]He just threw a grenade.
[179:30.85]They're just whipping grenades in here.
[179:39.02]Kevin.
[179:46.90]Here comes another guy.
[179:52.90]Alright, we're almost... Alright.
[179:57.32]Someone just gave a hundred bucks.
[180:00.26]Loose Cannon sandwich with ten thousand bits.
[180:03.78]One hundred dollars.
[180:06.46]And they say, I don't know why I did this, but I love you.
[180:11.30]Well, thanks a lot, man.
[180:13.81]Thanks for the hundred fucking dollars.
[180:15.19]That's incredibly generous of you.
[180:19.66]That is... Don't kill me, please.
[180:26.46]Seriously, how many times do you have to shoot somebody in the fucking face before they actually die?
[180:32.97]That wasn't even in the helmet.
[180:33.95]That was right in his eyes.
[180:35.07]Alright, quickly.
[180:39.17]I'm out of fucking ammo.
[180:41.13]Save it right here in case something happens.
[180:42.51]But, honest to God, though, dude, thank you, Loose Cannon, for the 100 bucks.
[180:50.54]That is an extreme amount of money to give one person.
[180:56.08]And I appreciate it nonetheless, man.
[180:58.77]Okay, let's see if we can continue to beat this mission.
[181:05.83]Mantle or Emerge?
[181:11.67]I'll take that one.
[181:12.23]I want to see at least 200 PogChamps.
[181:13.01]You know what I mean?
[181:25.89]I want to see 300 bog jams.
[181:29.00]There's one guy right there.
[181:41.88]There's one guy behind.
[181:44.38]Whoa!
[181:44.82]What?
[181:46.18]Wow, wow, wow, wow, wow.
[181:49.34]Hold on.
[181:50.58]That thing is firing anti-tank missiles at me.
[182:07.27]Got one person with that.
[182:15.00]So close.
[182:18.88]So close.
[182:24.92]Holy shit, there's a lot of people over here.
[182:31.89]I don't think I was supposed to do it like this.
[182:34.87]They have tanks now.
[182:38.24]Do I have to shoot it right, like, at the end of the tank deck?
[182:41.94]No.
[182:44.30]I don't know.
[182:47.58]I mean, like, I'm gonna have to shoot that tank somewhere, like, in some part of the tank, right?
[182:56.00]Wait a second.
[182:56.42]I might be able to take care of this.
[183:11.76]I can't drop down from here.
[183:18.81]Gotta get down there.
[183:19.45]They don't know where I am just yet.
[183:39.98]just go just go quick scope right through the heart
[184:06.60]Where are you?
[184:07.02]I need to get down one more level.
[184:09.07]Where the fuck is he?
[184:10.91]Where?
[184:13.71]Ah!
[184:16.91]You prick.
[184:20.11]Now they're just convening over here.
[184:21.33]Actually, this might be a good thing.
[184:22.70]Okay, there he is right down there.
[184:27.72]I'm dead.
[184:30.42]Save scum.
[184:44.58]These fucking checkpoints, man.
[184:46.80]They're going to give me an aneurysm.
[184:51.63]That's a big heart.
[184:53.25]There's a guy right here.
[184:54.15]There's not a guy right there anymore.
[185:08.47]There he is.
[185:09.61]Like, hidden over there.
[185:10.75]Oh, hi.
[185:11.06]Like, that didn't hit him in the head.
[185:15.76]Now he's just fucking climbing.
[185:16.92]What are you doing?
[185:19.17]This guy's fucked.
[185:21.61]I got him right in the kidney while he's climbing down the ladder.
[185:25.53]He's just gonna go.
[185:26.73]He's gone.
[185:27.83]And I'm getting shot from behind.
[185:28.90]I don't even know where I'm being shot from.
[185:30.28]That's how fucking stupid this is.
[185:32.30]Alright, hey, fucking Ubisoft.
[185:38.64]If you make a checkpoint system, like a restart checkpoint system...
[185:43.24]Like, why would you let it be like this?
[185:46.48]Fucking Ubisoft again.
[185:48.48]Of course it is.
[186:04.36]I can't... Come on.
[186:06.13]Give me bullshit.
[186:08.85]Please have something on you.
[186:13.52]That fucking Ubi sucked.
[186:17.52]At least I have some grenades.
[186:21.57]There's a guy across the way.
[186:32.12]I don't have any bullets to shoot that guy, unfortunately.
[186:34.36]We're just gonna have to hope that he doesn't fucking kill me.
[186:51.94]Give this to me come on God Oh My god, it's right here.
[187:03.43]It's right here It's it's right there.
[187:06.99]Did I do it?
[187:08.89]Did I do it?
[187:11.58]Destroy got destroy gun destroy gun.
[187:14.60]Oh
[187:19.61]I just threw a satchel on it.
[187:20.59]Why is it not exploding?
[187:27.01]Um...
[187:42.07]What- What was going on there?
[187:45.71]What was going- Why couldn't I- What's the fuck going on with that?
[187:54.52]Why?
[187:54.88]I don't- Like, how come I can't put the- I can't restart anywhere.
[188:09.61]It's gonna put me here every time.
[188:16.06]I'm gonna try this one more fucking time, and then I'm going to delete the game.
[188:39.20]Give this gun to me, please.
[188:44.47]Is there a guy coming down?
[188:45.55]I can't tell.
[188:49.39]There's a guy right here.
[188:52.47]Okay.
[189:06.08]Fuck.
[189:12.27]That guy was so good.
[189:13.35]Like, fuck you for being that good.
[189:18.91]Alright, he exploded.
[189:20.05]Alright, one more guy.
[189:22.47]Right here.
[189:25.19]Right?
[189:27.11]He's down there.
[189:29.53]Okay.
[189:30.69]Let's see what the fuck is going on here.
[189:39.60]Okay.
[189:41.14]place satchel charge it's time to move it's time to move nice slide come on stop being scared of the bullets and just get killed if I just have to wreck just get out of here I just leave
[190:10.37]It's time to move, apparently.
[190:15.21]Whatever that means.
[190:25.12]Don't I typically put a timer on this shit?
[190:32.84]Get me out of here.
[190:37.98]Get me the fuck out of here.
[190:47.79]I gotta just fucking run.
[190:49.23]They're shooting like machine guns.
[190:50.85]I can't fit through there.
[190:52.15]Are you shitting me, game?
[190:55.15]God.
[190:56.13]You've got like... I can't fit through there.
[191:01.57]I can't fucking fit through there, apparently.
[191:03.08]There's a guy right here.
[191:05.46]This guy's fucking dead.
[191:10.14]Eat shit, buddy.
[191:13.77]Good night.
[191:16.79]Well, he's distracted.
[191:24.73]I need to take my time with this.
[191:27.19]I can't.
[191:28.49]When it puts you in a position like every fucking... Oh, good thing you shot that guy in the stomach.
[191:34.29]What am I supposed to do about this?
[191:41.82]I wish I could, like, restart at one of the actual checkpoints.
[191:45.90]And not, like, my saves coming.
[191:48.28]Because that's the problem.
[191:50.18]The problem is that there's no actual checkpoints.
[191:52.42]They're just pretend checkpoints.
[192:03.19]That was a headshot.
[192:03.95]Yeah, okay.
[192:08.05]That was not... I did not hit that guy in the head either.
[192:11.55]That was not a headshot.
[192:18.11]Where is he?
[192:21.90]That guy has to die.
[192:27.20]Fine.
[192:27.46]Yeah, come around.
[192:28.14]Wrap all the way around and just die.
[192:29.92]I'm gonna push him off the ladder.
[192:42.68]Nice job.
[192:43.92]Good work, dude.
[192:44.70]You came down.
[192:45.18]You got me.
[192:50.64]At least I get rifle ammo again.
[192:54.31]Alright, here comes a guy running down.
[192:55.73]I'm going to snipe him.
[192:57.87]He's going to get red suitcased.
[193:01.31]He wasn't even close.
[193:02.23]Okay.
[193:02.57]He was not even close to the red suitcase.
[193:04.27]He was, actually.
[193:05.45]He was right there.
[193:06.67]He was very close to it.
[193:13.02]He was extremely close to the red suitcase.
[193:19.48]Okay, now we just have to not die by the machine gun.
[193:25.20]I gotta headshot the machine gun.
[193:29.44]No, you don't do that, actually.
[193:31.02]That's not something you do.
[193:31.72]Do I just have to get away?
[193:39.19]Should I just go this way?
[193:40.49]I don't fucking understand what it wants me to do right now.
[193:52.27]Like, should I just run?
[193:55.73]What the fuck is going on here?
[194:00.17]What was that little cutscene?
[194:03.87]The guy shot a flare in the air.
[194:05.07]Okay.
[194:08.79]Can I detonate this now?
[194:11.23]I'm no longer there.
[194:11.95]Okay.
[194:28.89]See ya.
[194:37.23]There's something down here, I guess.
[194:42.25]Find the ammo cache and destroy it.
[194:47.20]See, look at this.
[194:48.10]See?
[194:49.12]Add timer to satchel.
[194:50.04]I couldn't do that before.
[194:51.88]Seems Weaver's informant was right.
[194:54.66]There was no option for me to do that.
[194:57.08]Better deal with it.
[194:59.18]All he said was, time to run.
[195:00.82]I mean, what is that time to run?
[195:05.77]These are optional objectives.
[195:13.39]Shoot it with your rifle?
[195:15.19]I mean, I guess I could do that.
[195:17.22]Can I?
[195:17.54]Let me get to a position where I can shoot it.
[195:25.12]Why can't I just put the timer on it?
[195:28.26]Are you shitting me?
[195:31.43]Heart rate's too high.
[195:32.44]Well, hopefully this does work.
[195:34.80]Otherwise this would be a waste of my time.
[195:41.88]Heart rate is too high.
[195:43.06]Really?
[195:48.19]Where is it?
[195:48.43]It's like right there.
[195:49.69]Come on, I can't see it.
[195:55.29]I thought I was gonna, I thought I was gonna get the ledge.
[195:58.50]Do you see the fucking ledge right there?
[196:00.16]Come on.
[196:04.33]Why would I put this here if I couldn't just jump to it?
[196:09.15]Like, do you understand?
[196:09.82]Like, why does that... I thought I was gonna jump to that and that was the spot.
[196:14.28]Don't put that shit there if I... Where is the satchel?
[196:16.50]Fucking god game.
[196:24.16]I can't even move from here.
[196:26.48]It's just stuck here.
[196:27.40]Okay, great.
[196:28.04]Bye.
[196:36.25]Why does this exist?
[196:37.07]Why is this here?
[196:39.41]Why is that there?
[196:39.99]This whole heart rate thing really is starting to piss me the fuck off.
[196:53.34]I'm standing still.
[196:54.52]Just fucking lie on the ground then.
[196:55.78]Lie on the ground and breathe.
[196:57.00]What the hell?
[197:00.94]Are you okay?
[197:02.02]No?
[197:02.68]You're still not okay.
[197:06.00]Just sit right here and catch your breath for like fucking 12 minutes.
[197:08.13]Alright, is that it right there?
[197:15.59]I can't even fucking tell.
[197:16.47]There it is.
[197:32.19]I win.
[197:34.23]He's a delicate Carl.
[197:47.41]I headshot the C4.
[197:50.05]Salty as fuck.
[197:51.17]I mean, come on!
[197:53.45]What the fuck?
[197:59.68]Alright.
[198:02.86]I'm actually having fun, though.
[198:05.80]I think I will probably continue to stream this tomorrow.
[198:10.20]Just out of curiosity, though, I want to see what this is.
[198:13.55]Team deathmatch.
[198:14.31]Oh, yeah.
[198:15.15]Team distance king.
[198:16.21]Distance king.
[198:16.77]No cross.
[198:17.21]Let's just do any.
[198:18.07]See what happens.
[198:18.99]Just curious.
[198:21.97]Alright.
[198:22.29]Loadout.
[198:22.65]There's a lot of people.
[198:28.74]That can't be Winston Churchill?
[198:32.18]Where's Winston Churchill?
[198:39.10]Oh, it's gonna be this guy.
[198:41.20]Whatever.
[198:42.92]But I don't even know what he has.
[198:44.99]Alright, there's three people playing this right now.
[198:51.27]Work together to kill... Yeah, he's just team deathmatch.
[198:53.71]Okay.
[198:59.91]Yeah, I'll definitely be continuing this tomorrow.
[199:05.16]Team deathmatch.
[199:12.82]I'm going to be... It's 2v1.
[199:17.82]I'll make my way over here.
[199:19.12]I think it's... I don't know.
[199:20.10]How big is the map?
[199:20.60]I have no idea.
[199:21.90]I'm going to get up here.
[199:27.71]This is my little roost over here.
[199:31.72]Going up.
[199:35.28]Right here.
[199:36.86]Satchel.
[199:37.84]Okay, now I just gotta find... I gotta... Where's my... Where is he?
[199:43.10]He's right there.
[199:44.70]Three, two, one.
[199:46.44]Action shot.
[199:50.60]Jump!
[199:51.08]Jump, jump, jump!
[199:57.09]So why didn't I kill him?
[200:10.68]roost of the year.
[200:11.55]I don't even understand how big this map is.
[200:16.33]Alright, let's do this.
[200:18.86]I'm gonna be somebody that's never played a video game like this before.
[200:21.30]Ready?
[200:41.22]This is kind of dumb.
[200:49.18]It's a game about sniping.
[200:52.22]So nobody is anywhere.
[200:53.32]There's probably a guy up there.
[200:54.42]Let's just find where the guy is sitting.
[201:04.69]And then either die to him or hopefully... Found him.
[201:07.45]Found where the guy was.
[201:08.15]Found the guy that was in the bush.
[201:13.85]I have to get at least one kill.
[201:28.52]Ah!
[201:37.02]Whoo!
[201:43.29]Whoo!
[201:43.55]Whoa!
[201:49.94]Wait, how come he gets a fucking flashlight?
[201:51.62]That's such bullshit.
[201:52.96]Where's his flashlight?
[201:56.00]That guy's just shining a light at me.
[201:57.52]Oh, why don't I have one of those?
[202:15.27]Oh, oh, oh, oh.
[202:17.31]Oh, oh.
[202:21.17]Oh, oh.
[202:24.04]Oh.
[202:33.46]Oh.
[202:37.30]It's the other rock.
[202:40.76]Can you melee?
[202:41.34]I wonder if you can even melee.
[202:42.62]It'd be interesting if you could.
[202:43.74]That guy was trying to run up and kill me with a melee.
[202:46.45]Stopped him.
[202:47.15]Distract.
[202:47.63]Okay, death right here.
[202:49.49]Alright, come on, Fred.
[202:51.71]You can do this.
[203:02.62]That'll distract him.
[203:12.17]There, distraction.
[203:13.39]He's going to see me over there.
[203:22.69]I'm waiting for him.
[203:25.45]Come on.
[203:26.55]Yeah, sorry you'd run this way.
[203:27.51]I know you're going to try to... Oh.
[203:33.51]That was his friend.
[203:35.57]At least I know where he is now.
[203:40.93]If you could just seriously, like, not put dumb shit like that in the way.
[203:44.40]I understand where you were going with this.
[203:45.80]Like, I get it.
[203:46.28]You're, like, putting atmosphere in the game and, like, adding assets and there's sandbags and there's a candy cane that's lying down with barbed wire.
[203:52.38]But, like, it doesn't... Just get rid of it.
[203:54.10]Like, if I can't move over, just get rid of it.
[203:55.90]Delete it.
[203:56.72]You're fired.
[203:57.08]Let's go down.
[204:08.05]Anything in here?
[204:20.12]I got to get one more good kill and then I'm just leaving.
[204:30.98]One more kill and then I'm getting out of here.
[204:36.96]It's got to be like a sneak up melee kill.
[204:38.68]Come on.
[204:39.02]There's got to be somebody just sitting...
[205:01.78]He doesn't even know I went over here.
[205:09.69]That's it.
[205:09.93]Alright, I'll see you later.
[205:16.29]My cardio game is weak.
[205:19.19]I wanted to melee kill him.
[205:20.87]Whatever.
[205:23.09]Alright, that's gonna be it.
[205:24.61]We'll pick up where we left off yesterday, tomorrow.
[205:30.41]Quit to desktop.
[205:32.10]No, I can't quit to desktop because it'd be a black screen.
[205:38.76]So we'll pick it up tomorrow.
[205:42.90]Yeah, that game was fucking terrible.
[205:46.84]Thanks everybody for hanging out.
[205:48.39]I'll see you guys all tomorrow.
[205:50.91]Gonna go make some pasta or something.
[205:54.35]and I will I might start early tomorrow earlier tomorrow than usual because uh tomorrow night in like the evening I have some things to do so expect the stream to start potentially a little bit earlier than today and I will talk to you guys and if not it's possible it's possible I start a little early or I might just say whatever and we'll do it at seven
[206:23.49]I'll let you guys know in like the Discord or here you know so thanks everybody for all your resubs uh resubscriptions and new subscriptions we talked about a little bit of things there in the end mostly the fact that I'm gonna be changing how sub notifications happen
[206:50.36]Not going to be too drastic.
[206:51.32]I'll do it very slowly.
[206:53.38]But we talked about it already.
[206:55.70]Don't really need to close out on it.
[206:56.91]But have a good rest of your night, guys.
