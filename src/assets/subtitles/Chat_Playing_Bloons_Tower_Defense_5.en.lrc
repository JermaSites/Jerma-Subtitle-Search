[00:04.65]Time for balloons?
[00:09.91]Hmm... Smash Brothers?
[00:19.35]Flave Worms.
[00:20.47]Alright, that sounds kind of fun to me.
[00:28.87]What do they got for balloons here?
[00:29.97]They have balloons 2.
[00:34.19]Where can I get, like, the good, the fun one?
[00:38.93]GeoGuessr?
[00:39.79]Have you guys played GeoGuessr?
[00:48.72]BTD5.
[00:57.77]Alright, let's get it open.
[00:59.39]You guys can play this one.
[01:00.81]You guys can play one level of this one.
[01:10.72]Me versus you guys, tic-tac-toe.
[01:14.96]No, this guy's got a black bar on the side of his stream.
[01:17.36]It sucks.
[01:23.57]Alright, so I have a... I think I know how to play this game, kind of.
[01:29.97]So I'm gonna let you guys decide what the hell to do.
[01:34.55]Let me get this on the screen.
[01:47.56]Oh, I don't need to see that down there.
[01:55.22]Make sure it's big enough.
[01:58.64]Let's turn off the BRB screen, get the audio on here.
[02:00.74]Actually, I need to... Speaking of audio, hold on.
[02:06.52]Because this is extraordinarily loud.
[02:11.14]That's better.
[02:13.75]Now we can actually hear what's going on.
[02:17.72]Okay.
[02:19.86]So, where are we going?
[02:27.08]Did we just play him?
[02:40.15]TD6!
[02:42.59]No, we're on TD5.
[02:43.51]We're gonna play.
[02:44.49]That's what everybody wants.
[02:46.19]Play.
[02:46.97]New game.
[02:49.10]Okay, good luck.
[02:49.70]Here we go.
[02:51.00]This actually matters.
[03:04.70]Well... Beginner... We got... This is very evenly split here.
[03:12.69]It looks like we're going this way.
[03:25.38]I'll give you a minute.
[03:35.16]Alright, it's time to close this.
[03:42.74]Whoa!
[03:43.60]No, it's Jesus!
[03:45.78]What is- Oh, it's because I have the fucking click thing wrong.
[03:48.04]Hold on.
[03:51.66]Alright, do it again.
[03:52.20]People were just spam clicking.
[04:05.61]It's surprising that this is... this is the hardest decision of the whole night, apparently.
[04:17.03]Alright, that's it.
[04:18.16]Let's go to space.
[04:26.20]I can't even select Apocalypse, guys.
[04:35.94]Please do easy.
[04:39.91]I don't even- it's gonna take so long for you guys to figure this out.
[04:48.83]Alright, we're going to hard.
[04:54.60]On hard, your towers cost more than normal.
[04:56.56]Alright.
[04:56.80]Alright, how long do we have to wave?
[05:04.95]They're gonna come from this way.
[05:06.03]Alright, so we're gonna do Dart Monkey.
[05:13.87]Dart Monkey.
[05:14.95]Where?
[05:26.31]I can't put him... I can't put him right in the middle.
[05:29.51]Right there?
[05:29.97]Alright, he's going right there.
[05:41.29]Now what?
[05:50.65]Yo, what is this solar system, by the way?
[05:52.43]This is very crowded.
[06:14.88]Okay, I love and hate everything about what we're doing right now.
[06:21.09]Okay.
[06:22.41]Clear it.
[06:34.28]Is it time to go?
[06:36.66]Looks like it's time to go.
[06:40.95]Alright.
[06:42.13]Clear it.
[06:43.35]Here comes wave one.
[06:52.58]Speed it up!
[06:57.46]Okay.
[06:58.70]We gotta rank up.
[06:59.90]We unlocked a new tower.
[07:13.13]Share it on Facebook.
[07:14.66]No, I'm not fucking doing that.
[07:21.83]What?
[07:22.25]No, this, you can't.
[07:41.36]Okay, level up dart monkey leveled up.
[07:46.47]Now what?
[07:50.61]I fucking love this so much.
[07:55.64]Are we adding a tower or are we upgrading?
[08:17.86]Alright.
[08:18.82]We're doing the Tac Shooter.
[08:24.64]Where's it going?
[08:32.10]I can't put it here.
[08:40.85]Okay.
[08:41.17]Like, right here?
[08:42.67]This is where- I can't get it on top of him.
[08:48.49]Alright, now what?
[08:57.24]Which one of these am I upgrading?
[09:00.02]This one?
[09:03.76]Okay.
[09:04.14]No, no, no, no.
[09:04.84]People want to start.
[09:06.70]Let's go.
[09:13.84]Speed it up already.
[09:16.64]Some of them are gonna get through.
[09:21.48]Zoom for better selection?
[09:22.51]Alright, hold on.
[09:28.41]Let me see if I can get this in a better spot.
[09:32.83]I guess we could cut off the bottom here.
[09:35.97]Like this.
[09:38.58]Right?
[09:40.50]Technically.
[09:40.94]Do you guys need that information for anything?
[09:56.34]No, no, no, you need the information.
[09:58.22]Alright, well... Son of a fuck.
[10:09.01]Alright, you can see that, right?
[10:12.17]Alright, let's go.
[10:20.97]A hundred percent.
[10:22.55]Every single person is clicking here.
[10:25.99]Alright, upgrade.
[10:27.75]Long dart range.
[10:29.09]Makes the dart monkey shoot further than normal.
[10:32.25]Got it.
[10:32.49]Now what?
[10:40.29]Have I ever played Bloons?
[10:41.41]Oh yeah, I know, but I'm not playing Bloons right now.
[10:45.27]I am just a vessel for you guys to decide what you're gonna do.
[10:53.75]Here we go.
[11:04.55]I love how everyone just clicks on that, like, come on, let's go!
[11:06.89]Okay.
[11:12.16]Dart Monkey level up.
[11:14.24]Rank up for Sniper Monkey.
[11:19.00]Let's go ahead.
[11:19.50]I'm not sharing it on Facebook.
[11:23.05]Hmm, it could be any one of these.
[11:39.33]okay there I'm selecting this one now what what no that's not the right one
[12:07.13]The other one.
[12:08.65]Okay, I got the other one.
[12:11.76]Hold on, hold on everyone.
[12:12.88]Don't click yet.
[12:14.78]Okay, now click.
[12:31.27]Alright, looks like we're upgrading this guy.
[12:32.99]Good choice.
[12:38.33]Alright.
[12:38.69]Why would you make me upgrade and then sell it?
[12:42.15]Okay.
[13:12.45]If you want to vote, just click the screen.
[13:20.13]This can only go for so much longer.
[13:24.66]Alright.
[13:25.80]Enough people came in.
[13:31.44]Upgrade.
[13:32.92]Closing the poll in 10 seconds.
[13:34.49]Alright.
[13:40.85]That's it.
[13:55.32]Alright, let's go.
[14:03.08]Need more speed?
[14:09.91]Okay.
[14:12.67]The first green bloons are coming next.
[14:21.72]Alright, looks like sell, attack, or go.
[14:26.78]Looks like it's gonna be go.
[14:28.26]Yeah, let's go.
[14:53.29]Alright, you get a, uh, boomerang thrower.
[14:57.17]Let's reset it here.
[15:04.41]I think, I think that's the, yeah, the attack, attack shooter.
[15:10.84]What are you, I can't do anything.
[15:11.90]We can't do anything with the attack shooter.
[15:12.84]What are you talking about?
[15:18.14]Sell.
[15:19.94]Sell it?
[15:28.64]Damn, this is unanimous.
[15:35.20]Refreshing.
[15:35.70]Three, two, one.
[15:45.55]Oh dear.
[15:48.75]This is too close.
[15:49.69]I don't know which one these people are clicking on.
[15:52.97]I have no idea.
[15:53.93]I have to zoom in for this?
[15:57.63]Hold on.
[16:11.03]Hey, welcome to the 12-hour fucking Balloons Tower defense stream.
[16:31.80]Alright.
[16:34.32]Looks like we've got a Boomerang.
[16:37.36]Boomerang Thrower.
[16:40.04]Nice choice.
[16:45.95]The tack is stealing votes.
[16:49.96]Why?
[16:51.00]What are you guys talking about?
[17:17.77]Use the Windows Zoom tool?
[17:19.43]Well, I don't think that's going to work.
[17:24.70]Wait, is the magnifying glass even in Windows 10?
[17:27.08]Hmm, I wonder if that'll work.
[17:32.74]Alright, boomerang thrower.
[17:36.43]Let me get that out of here.
[17:46.36]Because this is a huge pain in the ass.
[17:50.03]Yeah, actually that's a great idea, because then I could just put the... This will go much smoother.
[17:55.25]Yeah, check this.
[17:57.39]Okay.
[17:59.55]Magnifying glass.
[18:04.98]Magnifier.
[18:06.12]Is that going to show up?
[18:07.38]Oh my god!
[18:09.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[18:10.44]Back... What the fuck is that?
[18:15.32]Lens.
[18:18.11]There we go.
[18:18.63]I don't think this is gonna work.
[18:21.89]Okay, let's see.
[18:22.95]Ready?
[18:23.67]Uh, this isn't doing anything.
[18:25.43]Yeah, you guys can't see it.
[18:49.51]This map is hard.
[18:51.55]Oh, wait a minute!
[18:52.55]Can you see this?
[18:55.11]Oh shit, you can't see it.
[18:57.11]That's unfortunate because it's zoomed in right now.
[18:59.72]Damn it, that's unfortunate.
[19:04.84]Capture the magnifier window in OBS.
[19:06.96]Now this is like lagging the computer too.
[19:14.01]Fuck.
[19:14.69]Oh well.
[19:19.29]I wonder if I can do this.
[19:21.19]I have an idea.
[19:21.63]Yeah, here's an idea.
[19:25.25]I'm gonna screenshot this, and then I'm gonna make a huge image and I'm gonna cut to it.
[19:32.99]Please turn off the music.
[19:35.23]Um, that has to come to a vote.
[19:47.65]Alright, let me get the screenshot in the right place.
[19:52.81]You can't even click it.
[19:54.31]Alright, well, you guys are clicking it.
[19:56.45]Give me one second while I get this image.
[19:58.46]This will actually work.
[20:02.04]This will actually work.
[20:07.74]So, let's do a print screen.
[20:10.37]And... Okay.
[20:14.65]Crop this out.
[20:17.40]So then you can actually select it.
[20:19.98]And I can make it huge.
[20:20.74]Yeah, that's much better.
[20:25.26]Much, much better.
[20:26.34]Okay, side panel.
[20:43.05]Add image.
[20:48.88]Side panel.
[20:52.29]There it is.
[20:52.85]How am I gonna make it?
[21:02.25]Okay.
[21:12.25]Somehow this is worse.
[21:20.57]Alright.
[21:26.81]So whenever we want to do this, I'm going to put that on screen.
[21:29.07]Look at that.
[21:30.75]Better.
[21:33.35]Alright, you ready to play?
[21:35.83]Where would you like me to go?
[21:41.42]Oh, if you want a tower, then here's what you have to do.
[21:45.08]If you want a new tower, you guys have to click here, like over here, and then I'll bring up the new the window.
[21:59.48]Alright, looks like people want a tower.
[22:03.10]Alright, let's clear that.
[22:07.89]Do it again.
[22:13.07]Where would you like it?
[22:21.16]Alright, I can only do this for so much longer before I have to stop.
[22:27.51]Alright, you got the just making sure it works so we're gonna do boomerang Where would you like the boomerang to go This is the worst stream ever I actually like think this is a I'm actually having like a good time
[23:01.67]Reset it.
[23:05.70]Do it again.
[23:16.30]Alright, looks like you want them down here.
[23:17.73]I can't even fit them here, can I?
[23:21.11]Okay.
[23:22.01]That's where it's going.
[23:29.27]And you click here?
[23:31.73]I can't do anything else with him.
[23:36.91]What am I supposed to do?
[23:37.65]Somebody said I'm too drunk for this.
[23:44.55]Alright, here it comes.
[23:55.32]Good placement, guys.
[23:56.50]Good placement.
[24:06.87]We did it.
[24:07.49]We did it.
[24:09.07]Congratulations, we did it.
[24:21.22]Really?
[24:31.37]You brought him in for one turn?
[24:43.26]Oh my fucking god.
[25:03.75]Alright.
[25:08.61]You want a new tower!
[25:10.15]No, a new tower now is what I want.
[25:13.57]Give me a new tower!
[25:15.09]I'll take one, please!
[25:24.70]What could you possibly- You're not gonna buy the boomerang again.
[25:32.67]You guys are out of your fucking minds.
[25:38.69]Why?
[25:43.02]Where would you like me to put them?
[26:02.61]Well, this is turning out to be a fucking huge waste of time.
[26:10.31]Anything else?
[26:13.98]Three, two, one.
[26:18.73]Why?
[26:19.79]Why would you do this?
[26:20.99]This is not even, this is not even interesting.
[26:48.96]Okay, hmm.
[26:49.96]Let's buy another tower.
[26:52.60]Sure.
[26:53.78]That sounds like fun.
[26:57.18]Hmm.
[26:58.36]Sniper attack?
[27:00.28]No, boomerang again.
[27:02.77]Boomerang?
[27:04.57]Nice.
[27:07.35]Alright, so, I mean, where should I put him?
[27:10.31]That's, you know, important.
[27:12.27]The placement of the character.
[27:13.83]Where should he go?
[27:16.77]Hmm.
[27:25.12]Okay.
[27:26.70]Pretty good spot for him, I think.
[27:27.74]Are we going to play?
[27:32.52]Or are we going to keep this up?
[27:34.27]Are we going to play the round?
[27:43.56]Oh, there's an equal amount of people that are like sick of this.
[27:54.72]Yep.
[27:55.56]There it is.
[27:58.56]Donezo.
[28:01.94]Let's play.
[28:08.71]A hundred fickle skip.
[28:12.17]That's my favorite part about this whole thing.
[28:14.49]It's how quickly everybody goes right to the fast forward button.
[28:20.63]Alright, rank up.
[28:21.33]We got Road Spikes.
[28:25.41]There's a new thing over here.
[28:29.19]Here we go.
[28:35.58]Road Spikes looks pretty popular.
[28:42.66]No, I'm not gonna share it.
[28:43.95]You guys already bought Pikachu socks.
[28:57.71]and a giant like 25 inch whale alright so where you want uh whale spikes where are they going you want them here where do you want these
[29:33.38]You don't want them.
[29:35.20]Why is everybody clicking here?
[29:44.15]Spikes are on go.
[29:48.61]That didn't do- no, what?
[29:52.93]Where do you want me to put these spikes?
[30:06.81]Okay, I'm gonna clear this because I don't think this is correct.
[30:08.99]What do you want this to be?
[30:13.85]Here.
[30:18.66]Okay, they're there.
[30:21.88]Now what?
[30:30.32]More.
[30:33.69]More road spikes.
[30:36.97]In the same place.
[30:39.43]You sure?
[30:44.99]Doesn't look like it.
[30:50.33]Looks like I'm just clicking the go button.
[30:54.80]10 seconds.
[31:02.30]And that's, that's it.
[31:03.92]I'm, I'm go, go.
[31:06.69]I had to close it right there.
[31:07.63]I love that.
[31:20.54]Alright.
[31:24.32]The round is over.
[31:29.39]That's a lot of balloons.

[31:37.31]Okay, level up.
[31:38.01]Dart monkey level up.
[31:38.77]Unlocked access to enhanced eyesight.
[31:42.49]And access to multi-target.
[31:50.11]Alright.
[31:57.07]Click on boomerang.
[32:01.69]Sure thing.
[32:02.35]Alright.
[32:04.66]In three, two, one, we come back.
[32:13.42]Looks like most people wanted this to be upgraded.
[32:17.27]Some of you guys are funny jokesters, pranksters.
[32:21.19]That's fine.
[32:21.57]Alright, we're going to do multi-target with the boomerang.
[32:35.53]Anything else?
[32:41.64]Why am I playing a game I used to play in school back in the fifth grade?
[32:52.89]No, I'm resetting this shit.
[32:54.75]No.
[32:57.85]And I somehow made it worse.
[32:59.45]Why?
[33:08.78]I'll wait until at least a thousand votes for this one.
[33:22.33]700 votes.
[33:29.29]There we go.
[33:30.98]Can people double vote?
[33:32.48]It's one vote per viewer.
[33:36.90]New tower.
[33:39.84]Yeah, that's good.
[33:40.40]New tower.
[33:51.25]Can we move our vote around?
[33:52.65]You just click on the screen and it counts as a vote.
[33:57.75]Can you click somewhere else to change your vote?
[33:59.47]I don't think so.
[34:00.45]Alright.
[34:08.77]I'm going to take the sniper.
[34:14.40]Good choice.
[34:15.88]Pretty good choice, I would say.
[34:20.44]Where's it going?
[34:27.89]Hmm.
[34:29.95]Doesn't fit here.
[34:30.87]It can't go there.
[34:41.00]Right here?
[34:41.64]Why can this not fit here?
[34:46.93]Is there a reason why this can't go right here?
[34:52.45]This is the only place I can put it is right here.
[34:55.71]It's got to be on land.
[34:59.70]Oh, I see.
[35:00.34]Okay.
[35:01.98]Well, this seems like it's the best place to put it.
[35:04.68]Somewhere, like, in here.
[35:07.70]Like, right here.
[35:10.92]Zoom in?
[35:11.58]I can't zoom in.
[35:19.34]Alright, there.
[35:23.76]Very good.
[35:26.11]What's next?
[35:37.18]Nice try, everybody.
[35:47.55]4K viewers for a children's game.
[35:49.31]Alright, here we go.
[35:59.73]Again?
[36:00.51]We're just going to go again?
[36:03.25]Pretty good call.
[36:14.86]Let's play this game on Cool Math Games.
[36:16.90]That's where we are right now, man.
[36:19.36]Oh, no, we're not.
[36:21.06]We're on the actual website.
[36:22.60]We're on the Ninja Kiwi website.
[36:27.82]What's next?
[36:32.13]New tower.
[36:34.35]Unfortunately, I don't have my screenshot.
[36:35.89]It doesn't have... You kind of need to remember where your things are because that... Remember the spot that that's in.
[36:41.94]Wow.
[36:56.87]not one person has decided to click anywhere else that's actually pretty nobody they clicked on the guy's nose over here that's crazy it was almost 600 votes at the same place okay let's put them down where's it going
[37:32.23]I guess in this general vicinity, that sounds fine.
[37:46.88]Like right here.
[37:47.67]Right, I'm going to try to get right in the middle, if I even can.
[37:55.77]Right here, right there.
[38:02.12]It won't hit anything if it's in the middle.
[38:03.50]Yeah, right there.
[38:04.22]Alright.
[38:12.79]Let's go.
[38:21.89]I can't believe this is still going.
[38:24.77]Now, neither can I. For some reason, I'm still interested in this.
[38:44.34]Alright.
[38:45.30]Dark Monkey leveled up.
[38:53.54]What would you like me to do with him?
[38:57.92]Okay.
[38:58.16]I don't understand.
[39:10.01]Wrong one.
[39:12.37]Wait.
[39:13.41]Do it again.
[39:17.39]This one.
[39:17.85]Okay.
[39:18.17]15%.
[39:18.19]13%.
[39:18.21]36% say they went razor sharp.
[39:29.92]Could pop two balloons at the same time.
[39:34.44]Alright.
[39:55.50]Again?
[39:55.84]Okay.
[39:57.46]Double upgrade, it seems.
[40:03.25]Where are we going from here?
[40:11.01]Alright.
[40:12.43]Speed it up.
[40:24.43]Rank 7.
[40:26.77]Another new tower here.
[40:29.39]But we don't have any money.
[40:35.24]I don't have enough money for that.
[40:37.92]Why am I saying me?
[40:41.39]This is you guys.
[40:42.61]You don't have enough money for this.
[41:02.97]Again?
[41:03.39]Oh, no, no, this is the... Hold on a minute here.
[41:08.82]Hold on a minute here.
[41:15.26]A lot of money, a lot of subs came in, too, that I missed.
[41:18.50]I'll make sure I touch upon them when we're done.
[41:23.19]But, thank you so much.
[41:25.39]MH Harmless, thanks for the $50.
[41:27.27]Now you have money for it.
[41:29.13]Thanks for $50. $50.
[41:34.56]That's a huge amount of money, man.
[41:35.44]Thank you.
[41:40.62]It's funny, I don't even have to say anything anymore.
[41:42.70]I just... Really?
[41:59.55]Okay.
[42:07.12]I don't know why.
[42:07.82]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[42:12.74]Not sell strong because you can't click down here.
[42:18.75]Why not?
[42:22.07]You should be able to click down there.
[42:23.21]That's kind of stupid.
[42:24.41]So you wanted strong.
[42:26.67]Alright.
[42:29.47]Strong.
[42:38.41]Okay.
[42:40.07]We got it.
[42:40.45]We're good.
[42:40.99]We're good.
[42:41.27]Everything's fine.
[42:52.16]You guys are doing a really good job.
[42:58.44]Start it again.
[43:03.46]How much longer am I gonna do this?
[43:05.18]I don't know.
[43:10.52]Tonight was real weird.
[43:13.40]But whatever.
[43:16.38]Okay, let's open that up.
[43:22.01]Make sure you know what you're clicking on here.
[43:23.33]Alright, looks like we want a cannon.
[43:42.06]Cannon, where is it going?
[43:54.33]Losing viewers, it's alright.
[43:57.56]We're just hanging out, having fun.
[44:02.76]Hmm, over here or over here?
[44:12.62]There's a lot of different opinions, apparently, right now on Bloon's tower defense.
[44:20.07]The general consensus for the majority is... Well, that's not even a... Yeah.
[44:25.37]Right here?
[44:26.49]Alright, let's go.
[44:37.60]Chat is min-maxing.
[44:43.04]The balloons have a powerful new advancement regrowth.
[44:45.04]These balloons are distinguished by their heart shape.
[44:48.53]If not popped quickly, they will grow layers back to their original size.
[44:51.61]Make sure you guys are aware of that.
[44:52.55]Is that it?
[44:57.83]That was the whole round.
[45:04.12]Okay.
[45:04.22]Okay.
[45:17.25]Put on some music.
[45:19.53]Okay, I'll put on some music.
[45:20.71]That sounds like a good idea.
[45:23.63]Rank up.
[45:24.45]Alright, let's put music on.
[45:36.84]See, this is where it breaks up.
[45:38.04]We're on round 20.
[45:40.54]Coming up on round 19.
[45:41.74]Look at all these different opinions.
[45:51.02]This is wild.
[45:56.50]Alright, looks like we're gonna... Gotta go by what the highest percentage is here.
[46:10.41]I gotta reset.
[46:10.95]I've already selected this thing.
[46:12.74]I've already selected the cannon.
[46:13.52]I'm gonna reset.
[46:15.98]Ready?
[46:16.20]Here we go.
[46:21.96]Sell it.
[46:24.63]No, no, no.
[46:25.05]Okay, it's not.
[46:25.63]It's strong.
[46:26.37]Is it strong or sell?
[46:27.45]I can't tell.
[46:27.97]Alright, strong.
[46:31.89]Strong is selected.
[46:34.73]Ready?
[46:35.31]Three, two, one.
[46:37.09]Here it comes again.
[46:37.63]Where do you want me to click?
[46:42.62]Okay, we got the ninja.
[46:46.08]Alright.
[46:47.46]Three, two, one.
[46:49.52]Where do I click?
[46:53.27]Upgrade discipline, increase attack range, and attack speed.
[46:57.99]Alright.
[47:00.71]3, 2, 1, where are we going?
[47:05.73]That's all you wanna do?
[47:07.62]Okay.
[47:17.38]You guys are good at this game.
[47:18.54]You guys are good at this game.
[47:19.76]This is never gonna end!
[47:27.33]Are we going again?
[47:27.89]We're going again?
[47:33.71]Black balloons and white balloons are small but contain two pink balloons when popped.
[47:37.90]They're immune to explosions and immune to freezing.
[47:41.22]Okay, gotta be careful here.
[47:50.52]Alright.
[47:59.68]Oh, for 75 IQ, you guys are doing a real good job.
[48:01.86]Alright, new tower.
[48:03.60]Whatever it was, this is the ice tower down here.
[48:33.96]People are still clicking on the tack tower.
[48:35.56]That's my favorite thing.
[48:37.00]Alright, let's get the guys.
[48:41.41]Where is he going?
[48:46.03]I need to take a new screenshot.
[49:04.53]People are like, save it, save the game.
[49:06.53]Right over here.
[49:14.93]Right in there is where I can fit it.
[49:16.53]I can only fit it right here.
[49:17.89]Alright, that's it.
[49:25.51]Three, two, one.
[49:34.05]waste of money sell no people no we're going right let's go okay save save the game log in to save your game I don't have an account here so I can't do that
[50:02.23]And I click on the ice tower.
[50:04.03]Ice tower has been clicked.
[50:07.21]And... Now what?
[50:14.87]You guys just put it down.
[50:16.11]It was just put down!
[50:17.15]Wrong- This is what you wanted to select.
[50:30.11]No range.
[50:30.69]No, this is... Wait, we can do it again.
[50:32.37]What do you want me to select?
[50:35.14]Make it really clear.
[50:35.90]Make accuracy here.
[50:37.62]Accuracy.
[50:45.36]Fuck.
[50:45.98]They're right on top of each other.
[50:53.07]That's... Okay, if it was this one, all the circle would be up here.
[50:59.25]Okay, now what?
[51:06.59]Now it was just put down here!
[51:11.35]Didn't you guys just put it down?
[51:12.25]I have to listen, okay?
[51:20.96]What would you like to do now?
[51:27.14]I placed it wrong.
[51:28.22]How did I place it wrong?
[51:29.44]Are we going back over here?
[51:32.12]Hold on.
[51:34.02]Are you guys trying to correct me putting it in the wrong place?
[51:47.24]No way.
[51:53.50]Really?
[51:59.43]Okay, I'm buying the ice tower right now.
[52:02.52]Ice tower.
[52:04.24]Let's lower this.
[52:08.06]And where do you want it?
[52:16.86]You got to be accurate.
[52:20.69]Why do you want it back up here in the same spot?
[52:22.97]Like here?
[52:25.45]Right here.
[52:39.97]That's where it's going.
[52:41.61]Right in the center.
[52:42.85]Like here.
[52:44.75]That's not going to hit anything.
[52:50.38]Need zoom?
[52:50.98]Alright, we do need zoom for this one, apparently.
[52:54.42]Hold on.
[52:58.12]I'm going to zoom the fuck in.
[53:08.19]Because this is important.
[53:09.31]If you guys are making me sell... Okay.
[53:15.10]Where do you want it?
[53:24.58]Jesus.
[53:31.13]It can't even go over here.
[53:51.27]I love this.
[53:53.37]This is so much fun.
[53:54.49]I don't know why, just knowing... This is wonderful.
[53:58.77]I love this.
[53:59.23]Okay, now I have to fix this.
[54:17.56]It's just in a worse spot.
[54:21.86]You guys have to come to a determination of where you want me to put the towers, guys.
[54:27.86]Okay.
[54:28.80]Are we ready?
[54:36.99]No, you gotta be fucking kidding me, guys.
[54:47.25]I'm waiting for...
[54:50.87]Need more participation than this.
[54:53.40]Come on, okay, there we go.
[54:56.66]Alright, with that, yeah, we're over 3,000 now.
[54:58.66]Go.
[54:58.94]Okay.
[55:09.17]Did the ice even do anything?
[55:14.79]I don't think the ice did anything.
[55:19.55]Alright, well, we're at 23 of 85.
[55:23.19]You guys are almost, we're getting close to being in a place, a good spot.
[55:29.76]What now?
[55:33.18]Alright, I need some clarification.
[55:34.86]Are you trying to click on the dart or the ice?
[55:37.32]I think you're trying to click, I don't know.
[55:38.51]Am I going to have to zoom in again?
[55:45.31]I feel like it's 50-50.
[55:53.13]Alright, if you- okay, here's how this is gonna work.
[55:55.53]I'm gonna refresh it.
[55:56.39]If you want the ice tower to be selected, you gotta click over by the sun.
[56:00.86]If you want the dart, you gotta click like up here, like over here.
[56:05.18]Alright?
[56:08.92]Reset- resetting it.
[56:17.67]Ice it looks like, okay.
[56:23.06]Alright, selecting ice.
[56:27.88]I'm assuming we're gonna do an upgrade for this?
[56:35.13]Guys.
[56:47.44]It's- sell it.
[56:48.96]It's trash.
[56:52.74]It's not a joke.
[56:53.70]It's bad.
[56:54.34]Well, how is it voted for in the first place?
[57:00.60]I've sold this before and then you guys bought it again and made sure it was in the correct placement and now 70% of you want to sell it.
[57:20.97]Okay.
[57:28.14]Stop asking questions, vessel!
[57:34.02]Okay, another tower.
[57:43.28]So this looks like it's gonna be... Is that... that's a ninja?
[57:51.21]I think that's a ninja.
[57:57.69]Yeah, that's very clearly over the ninja.
[58:07.60]Okay.
[58:14.03]Where's he going?
[58:22.10]Over here.
[58:27.60]I'm going to try to get it as close into the circle as I can.
[58:31.58]Wherever the center of this circle is, is where it's gone.
[58:36.26]Right there.
[58:43.12]Enhance, enhance.
[58:45.94]How do you vote?
[58:46.98]You just have to enable the extension and you just click on the screen.
[58:52.02]Okay, that looks good.
[58:59.75]It's almost time for round... Round, like, 30?
[59:03.57]Round 20, whatever it is?
[59:10.61]Oh, damn.
[59:11.19]Alright.
[59:11.65]Looks like I know what people want to do.
[59:17.18]Alright.
[59:17.46]What's next?
[59:21.86]Round 23 of 85.
[59:22.22]Incoming.
[59:22.60]Incoming.
[59:32.78]Fucking easy.
[59:40.08]Again?
[59:40.30]Okay.
[59:42.52]Camo balloons are very dangerous since most towers cannot hit them.
[59:45.89]Any balloon types can also be camo balloon and so will all the balloons that come out of that one.
[59:50.87]They can only be hit by towers that can detect camo.
[59:54.01]All other attacks will miss if you do not have any towers that can detect camo.
[59:57.73]Use road spikes.
[60:09.05]Nice.
[60:10.51]Bomb tower level up.
[60:12.55]Access to extra range.
[60:15.79]And a glue gunner has been unlocked.
[60:21.21]Alright, any changes that you guys would like to make?
[60:30.64]We're not sharing.
[60:31.46]We're never gonna share it.
[60:37.62]Alright, new tower.
[60:41.97]So make sure you remember where those slots are.
[60:47.29]You got it?
[60:47.91]You see where they are?
[60:58.32]Glue is being 100%ed right here.
[61:05.66]Move the picture to the left.
[61:08.44]Okay.
[61:09.12]So it's easier to click on.
[61:13.73]So the glue was selected.
[61:21.11]I don't think I've ever played this game this long to see what this even does.
[61:28.23]But you've got glue now.
[61:30.20]Where would you like to put it?
[61:31.28]Up here.
[61:40.60]Up here.
[61:41.00]Over here.
[61:47.56]What's the extension called?
[61:50.14]Uh, smart map?
[61:52.42]Smart map, smart click maps is what it's called.
[61:55.38]You don't, you should be able to just activate it from, uh, from your, you just have to click a button, don't you?
[62:03.85]I don't, this is too, I got to go in.
[62:05.31]We got to zoom in here.
[62:08.01]In fact, you know, I'm, I'm just going to take a screenshot of this too.
[62:11.27]And so we can zoom into it because it's been so conflicted.
[62:14.96]Print screen.
[62:16.42]Give me a second.
[62:28.59]Let's just get the area here so I can zoom way in.
[62:39.22]Okay, let's get it on there.
[62:41.32]Alright.
[62:49.20]So we're gonna do it like this, so it's easier for you guys to select fine- finite details.
[62:56.89]Okay, so where do you want it to go?
[63:05.45]Oh, sorry.
[63:12.83]Right in the middle there?
[63:13.65]Alright, right there.
[63:20.25]Right in the middle.
[63:22.50]You got it.
[63:26.68]Alright.
[63:29.63]So you wanted it right here.
[63:35.95]Right there.
[63:38.27]That's as close as I can get it.
[63:39.42]Alright.
[63:44.76]That's actually the worst spot?
[63:47.48]Why?
[63:47.70]What?
[63:56.08]Surprisingly, haven't even lost one life yet.
[63:58.94]How have you guys not lost one life?
[64:11.53]That's kind of ridiculous.
[64:17.53]Indecisive.
[64:23.39]Going again?
[64:38.76]Alright, Ninja Monkey leveled up.
[64:46.42]Now what?
[64:48.22]We're going to have to enhance this.
[64:49.61]I have no idea what you guys want me to do.
[64:56.25]Restarting in 3, 2, 1.
[65:07.11]I think that's click on the ninja right yep the middle the middle one right there yep okay upgrade yep sounds good to me
[65:45.77]Okay.
[65:46.83]I got the other ninja selected.
[65:59.65]Alright.
[66:01.07]Upgrade this one to Seeking.
[66:05.69]Oh, sell it!
[66:14.99]There's a small percentage of you guys that really want that Sniper upgrade.
[66:24.06]But... I'm going to have to refresh here.
[66:28.34]I don't know what's going on.
[66:37.23]Sniper?
[66:38.89]Okay.
[66:39.03]Okay.
[66:45.90]Sniper selected.
[66:47.34]Three, two, one.
[66:55.33]Alright.
[66:55.87]Shoots can pop through four layers of balloon and can pop lead and frozen balloons.
[67:03.72]Alright.
[67:10.76]Now it's time for the cannon.
[67:12.82]Cannon unlockables.
[67:14.72]Shoots?
[67:15.04]What do you mean, shoots?
[67:21.36]Okay, got the cannon on.
[67:33.31]Okay.
[67:36.13]Preparing yourselves for the next round.
[67:37.61]You puny vessel.
[67:38.57]You're no match for the hive mind.
[67:40.45]We'll take over your computer.
[67:42.87]Like those people in the unfriended horror movie.
[67:50.18]Lead balloons are slow, but they're immune to anything sharp.
[67:52.30]They contain two black balloons when popped.
[68:00.10]That was fucking easy.
[68:12.00]How have you guys done this so well?
[68:15.68]Seriously, how is this possible?
[68:28.37]More?
[68:28.49]We're gonna go again.
[68:33.46]Am I gonna stream World of Light?
[68:38.50]Yeah, I'm probably gonna play Smash Bros.
[68:40.26]tomorrow.
[68:42.49]Next round, many zebra balloons.
[68:43.91]Are we prepared for this?
[68:54.38]People want to go.
[68:54.96]Got some nervous people in the chat though.
[69:00.09]Nervous?
[69:00.79]Why are you so nervous?
[69:13.45]Alright.
[69:21.08]I did it.
[69:21.42]I had to do it.
[69:30.78]Everybody's clicking on tax.
[69:37.87]Glue gunner leveled up.
[69:38.85]Glue soaks through all layers of blue.
[69:41.59]And exploding pineapple.
[69:50.95]This guy.
[69:51.53]What would you like me to do with this guy?
[70:01.73]We want the upgrade, okay.
[70:05.91]12%, always sell.
[70:18.53]Strong, strong, strong.
[70:25.03]Okay.
[70:26.95]Selected strong.
[70:39.60]Boomerang upgrades.
[70:40.68]Sniper guys.
[70:43.28]I have no say in this.
[70:46.98]I'm only here to click buttons on the screen.
[70:49.34]That's the only reason why I'm here.
[70:53.06]Okay.
[70:54.12]Make sure you see where you want these towers.
[70:56.11]Because they're... Here we go.
[71:03.55]It's a good reference to see where they are.
[71:12.68]Sniper tower.
[71:13.32]It's currently destroying.
[71:27.61]Okay.
[71:28.91]Selected.
[71:36.58]You want to know a funny tidbit of information?
[71:40.20]This would be the only time I would ever have beaten anything on this game.
[71:47.55]We might need an enhancer.
[71:50.21]You guys are beating this while I'm clicking.
[71:51.75]It's on my computer, so it's technically mine.
[71:53.33]Right, it's on my console.
[71:55.29]So it's mine.
[71:59.95]Technically.
[72:03.03]Well, yeah, I gotta enhance this.
[72:07.68]Do it again.
[72:19.26]Right in the middle there.
[72:20.12]68%, 70, 60, yeah, just about 70%.
[72:30.02]I'm gonna go right in the middle there.
[72:36.41]I'm the host for the hive mind.
[72:37.67]Alright, it's gonna go right there.
[72:45.16]Right here.

[73:09.62]I see the... I see.
[73:12.63]Okay.
[73:16.81]I'm just coming to this crazy realization.
[73:19.21]Any one of you guys could open this up right now and play it.
[73:29.04]And then put it on strong.
[73:35.02]Anybody could just open this.
[73:38.02]Why are we all sitting here doing this?
[73:43.70]We are playing.
[73:44.64]That's right.
[73:45.00]That's true.
[73:45.36]Alright, good luck.
[73:59.25]Getting more dangerous.
[74:00.43]Uh-oh.
[74:14.38]Jesus, give me a fucking break.
[74:16.14]Okay, so we're upgrading.
[74:19.37]The collective is clicking here.
[74:22.43]Or, wait a minute, hold on.
[74:33.68]Alright, I got him selected.
[74:39.75]Upgrade.
[74:53.01]I can talk to my mother on the phone later.
[74:55.25]Oh, what did you do today?
[74:57.13]I, uh... I sat in a chair and 4,000 people yelled at me and clicked on a screen for me to put monkeys down for a tower defense game.
[75:10.23]Oh!
[75:16.97]And then we're upgrading this?
[75:25.38]I guess so.
[75:32.24]What else would you like to do with your turn, chat?
[75:38.03]I'm seeing a lot of just goes.
[75:44.59]Okay.
[75:46.21]Let's hope you were right.
[76:02.25]Uh, I... That looks like it's up here.
[76:05.92]We've got 74% going to the tax.
[76:19.83]Alright.
[76:22.93]Where would you like me to put them?
[76:34.05]I need to refresh, refresh.
[76:41.67]Looks like all down here, I think I'm gonna go, how many should I do, one?
[76:47.23]Do a whole line?
[76:55.32]Alright, I'm gonna put down one right in the middle.
[76:57.98]There's one down there.
[76:59.46]Okay, is that all you need?
[77:06.47]You want another one?
[77:12.99]Okay.
[77:18.99]More.
[77:19.29]55% of you still want me to put them here.
[77:27.05]Okay, refreshing again.
[77:33.53]Every time it's refreshed,
[77:36.57]More and more people are like, you know, I think that's enough tax.
[77:38.89]It looks good.
[77:41.15]It really is a collective.
[77:42.23]You guys are at 34.
[77:59.27]Round 34 of 85.
[78:06.10]New tower.
[78:15.12]It's a good thing we bought those techs.
[78:20.69]Okay.
[78:21.85]New tower.
[78:22.51]Make sure you see where it is on the screen there.
[78:29.77]You know, some people pay $15 on consoles to play this.
[78:37.42]Yeah, but you're playing it right now for free.
[78:45.45]It's pretty unanimous.
[78:48.01]You guys want the Buccaneer?
[78:49.27]I don't even need to see anything else.
[78:57.40]Oops.
[78:59.12]Move that away.
[79:01.24]Alright, well, where do you want it?
[79:06.72]This might be an enhanced scenario.
[79:08.20]It is.
[79:08.72]It's going to be an enhanced scenario.
[79:12.17]Please just wait till I refresh.
[79:16.69]This is where the buccaneer is going.
[79:38.25]You can't put him there?
[79:39.51]He can fit there.
[79:43.55]Yeah, he's going right there.
[79:47.80]Thank you for voting.
[79:49.54]He's going right in this little channel here, right there.
[79:55.20]Right there.
[79:55.72]Alright.
[80:03.41]What next?
[80:10.42]Didn't this game have music?
[80:11.48]Oh yeah, sure.
[80:14.68]Alright, here we go.
[80:16.08]Which one of these upgrades?
[80:19.32]That's the important thing.
[80:22.02]No, I can't do that one.
[80:39.92]Is that all you want to do?
[80:44.56]I can't tell if everyone's trying to get tips, save, or if they're trying to turn the music off.
[81:07.01]Okay, go on.
[81:20.97]You want to put it back on?
[81:25.94]Tips.
[81:27.28]Okay.
[81:27.68]Tips are no longer on.
[81:34.10]Alright.
[81:35.51]Hold on.
[81:35.79]Wait, wait, wait.
[81:36.65]If you want the music to come back, click on the boomerang.
[81:41.37]If you want me to put the tips back on, click up here.
[81:46.46]Okay.
[81:58.54]Put on the Doom OST.
[82:00.12]Oh my god, hold on.
[82:01.61]Okay.
[82:15.82]Now what do you want me to do?
[82:29.20]Time to go.
[82:30.22]What now?
[82:32.60]No, I'm not doing it louder.
[83:06.05]Alright, we selected the monkey.
[83:08.35]This one?
[83:08.75]I think it's this one.
[83:09.43]What would you like?
[83:16.69]Sharp.
[83:24.04]Okay.
[83:26.60]Three, two, one, select.
[83:31.87]And the other one too, huh?
[83:45.19]What did you do last night, honey?
[83:49.23]Oh, well, I had 4,000 people in a chat room.
[83:54.14]We were playing Balloons Tower Defense 5.
[83:59.40]I wasn't playing it.
[84:00.98]They were telling me what to do, and I was blasting the Doom soundtrack.
[84:15.03]Kind of split here on what people want to do.
[84:19.43]Turn it up?
[84:39.54]Now what?
[84:40.96]Go again?
[84:41.38]No?
[84:44.00]You want to select this guy.
[84:45.38]Now what do you want to do?
[84:58.43]My left ear.
[85:02.02]Is it loud in the left ear?
[85:10.04]So buying this one.
[85:13.68]Thanks for playing, guys.
[85:14.52]Anything else?
[85:20.03]Again, this one too.
[85:22.21]Both of them.
[85:22.95]Sonic Boom.
[85:34.61]Here's the wild thing about this stream.
[85:37.37]Remember the first 10 minutes when we were doing this?
[85:39.73]I was like, I don't know how to click this and then you vote.
[85:42.16]Look at how streamlined this has become.
[85:44.10]This is almost scary.
[85:45.14]This is almost terrifying.
[86:06.82]Ooh, that was close.
[86:07.80]Alright, hold on.
[86:09.64]I gotta change the volumes here.
[86:12.20]Hold on, wait.
[86:12.56]Hold on.
[86:28.35]Oh, that's gotta stop for a second.
[86:30.46]I'm gonna turn this down.
[86:34.52]The chess game is still- Wait, what?
[86:36.73]Okay, I thought I just X'd out of the fucking window.
[86:38.45]I thought I just closed Bloons Tower Defense 5.
[86:40.95]And there's no saving.
[86:42.29]Well, that would have been so bad.
[86:43.71]I would have just gone- I would have gone crying in the shower.
[86:49.66]Okay.
[86:50.72]I need to put this in a different window so I can control how loud that is.
[86:57.26]Give me one second, guys.
[87:05.46]Why am I just loading up a random webpage right now?
[87:13.20]What the fuck was that?
[87:21.39]Was that an ad?
[87:22.15]I have no idea what that was.
[87:32.61]I opened up another tab.
[87:35.96]And it went to like... I don't have any fucking idea.
[87:44.31]This is correct, right?
[87:49.83]That was fucking weird.
[87:51.01]So I can do that.
[88:11.10]And then that should be open now.
[88:15.56]I'm spending a lot of time trying to get this to work.
[88:19.12]There we go.
[88:19.80]Okay.
[88:20.22]So now drop this.
[88:22.94]And then put this higher than that.
[88:24.90]Now that should be good.
[88:25.80]I'm ready to go.
[88:36.85]Okay.
[88:37.81]Here we go.
[88:46.25]Tax?
[88:56.92]I think we're just gonna go.
[88:58.32]I think we're just gonna go.
[89:06.51]I think you're gonna lose.
[89:07.25]Oh!
[89:17.15]Now what, guys?
[89:18.71]That's not good.
[89:19.39]50?
[89:19.41]Alright, what do you want?
[89:36.31]Which one?
[89:36.83]Does it matter?
[89:38.19]Look at everybody panicking right now.
[89:39.45]People are panicking.
[89:40.79]Alright, I think we need attacks.
[89:41.97]Oh shit, close the game.
[89:44.12]Get the ice monster.
[89:53.59]Now what?
[90:02.16]I gotta refresh it.
[90:03.42]I think people are panicking.
[90:09.05]This is almost $2400.
[90:10.55]You guys sure about this?
[90:13.15]Let me let the votes come through.
[90:29.40]Alright.

[91:53.36]At the end, we did three last time.

[92:45.02]Okay, that's enough, apparently.
[92:46.32]Alright, let's go.

[93:45.61]Let's go.
[93:54.90]You want this one?
[94:02.04]Which one is it?
[94:02.54]I'm going to have to zoom in for this.
[94:10.08]Okay.
[94:11.22]Got him selected.
[94:17.44]Enhanced eyesight.
[94:18.28]Increased attack range even further.
[94:19.60]Allows Dart Monkey to shoot camo balloons.
[94:25.14]Sounds good.
[94:26.40]What's next?
[94:35.57]More upgrades on this guy.
[94:36.85]You want the spike-a-pult.
[94:51.83]Alright.

[94:58.52]Refreshing.
[94:59.48]Here we go again.
[95:05.44]I'm gonna let this one play for a second because looks like there's some uncertainty amongst us.
[95:28.89]Panicking.
[95:31.02]This is the one.
[95:31.66]There's 4,500 votes here.
[95:34.20]How is that possible?
[95:34.90]There's more votes than people.
[95:36.04]What?

[95:38.52]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:41.87]Again.
[96:02.42]Okay.
[96:03.70]That's what the people want.
[96:10.65]Again.
[96:16.73]This is split here between buying this and putting it on last.
[96:19.59]Alright, last.
[96:29.60]Now what?
[96:35.79]This again.
[96:36.37]Buy it again.
[96:38.13]Alright.
[96:38.63]This is on Razor Sharp.
[96:43.08]You guys have the confidence to win, do you think?
[96:49.88]No, you want more.
[96:50.94]Okay.
[96:59.57]Take a look and see where you want it.
[97:08.34]Oh, fuck, look at this.
[97:13.00]There is some arguments gonna be happening right now between the ace and a cannon.
[97:24.55]Looks like it's gonna be an ace.
[97:35.32]Let's go.
[97:36.94]Where's it going?
[97:49.60]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa!
[97:51.25]Look at this!
[97:51.87]Cancel!

[98:08.56]Cancel.
[98:17.34]Alright, what do you want in replace of it?
[98:30.74]I'm scared.
[98:36.48]Playing co- I'm gonna refresh it one more time, just to make sure chat gets this right, because we're at the point where if you make a mistake, it's over.
[98:54.24]Can it is?
[98:59.46]Let's hope you get good placement.
[99:10.37]Oh dear, we have to enhance this one.
[99:12.58]How am I even going to get it over there?
[99:16.32]It doesn't fit over here.
[99:23.57]Guys, it can't go over here.
[99:30.49]It has to go on land.
[99:35.73]I can't squeeze it anywhere.
[99:39.36]Refresh it.
[99:46.16]Oh, this is an enhanced scenario, I think.
[99:47.98]Yeah, it is.
[99:49.85]Refresh it again.
[99:50.65]Enhance.
[99:53.79]Ready?
[99:55.95]Be certain about this.
[100:07.69]Looks like you want it right up there on Earth.
[100:11.07]Kind of right in the middle of those clouds.
[100:17.58]Okay.
[100:18.94]Pull it back.
[100:25.82]Right here.
[100:39.29]Now we see the fight between what upgrades to do.
[100:46.55]How much money?
[100:48.57]535 bucks.
[100:50.11]We can only do one of these.
[100:50.97]Holy shit.
[101:01.18]Uh... I'm gonna refresh it again, because a lot of people clicked up there still.
[101:07.16]Alright, ready?

[101:54.91]It's time.
[101:59.00]Good luck.

[102:28.86]There you go, 41.
[102:29.74]You did it.

[103:09.26]You gotta click, like, almost near the bottom of that page.
[103:12.86]Click on the cannon if you want the cannon.
[103:14.88]Ready?
[103:28.69]What the fuck is happening?

[103:36.47]They've made it to nearly just about the halfway point.
[103:39.59]And it's on hard.
[103:43.20]Alright, looks like it's gonna be blue.
[103:51.32]Okay.
[103:52.28]What would you have me do with this?
[104:00.91]Uh, stickier glue.
[104:01.85]Okay.

[105:23.01]If we're going to do this again, we're going to do strong.
[105:38.24]Alright, now go!
[105:44.74]Do we need tacks, too?
[105:48.72]Are you sure about that?
[105:50.96]Hold on.
[105:51.72]I'm gonna refresh.
[105:54.96]Okay.
[105:58.04]I'm seeing a lot less people clicking on the... It's definitely down here.
[106:08.77]I don't know.

[106:51.58]Good luck.
[107:12.16]You guys are doing pretty well.
[107:19.95]Nothing's even getting remotely by.
[107:29.50]The cannons are syncing with the song.
[107:32.14]Are they really?
[107:46.28]Pretty stellar job.
[107:48.10]I'm not gonna lie.
[107:51.91]Super monkey.
[108:01.25]More towers, more towers.
[108:07.41]Alright, more towers.

[108:15.21]Make your selection.
[108:19.74]Which one?
[108:25.05]I can't afford the Super Wucky.
[108:28.63]He's too much money.
[108:31.01]He's 3780, we have 2279.
[108:31.75]Yeah, guys, that... That's not gonna happen.
[108:49.83]I'm gonna have to pull this back and see what else your other options are here.
[108:59.18]Just go, go, go, go, go, go.
[109:03.52]Alright.
[109:03.94]I hope that wasn't a mistake.
[109:29.45]Uh-oh.
[109:31.43]Are they gonna make it around?
[109:36.06]Oh, you guys are golden.
[109:39.22]Buccaneer level up.
[109:45.63]Save?
[109:46.07]I can't save the game.
[109:47.37]I need to make, like, an account.
[109:49.77]This is one and done, guys.
[109:51.89]If you lose, it's over.
[109:57.05]Alright, Buccaneer.
[110:03.34]Now what?
[110:07.38]Grape shot.
[110:19.60]Okay.
[110:23.84]2,400 bucks.
[110:26.84]What else is your plan?
[110:27.58]Uh... I'm gonna have to enhance with this one.
[110:34.86]Or is it just, okay, do you want this one or this one?
[110:38.96]That's the thing here.
[110:40.14]How much money is it?
[110:40.80]Ah, I gotta enhance on this one.
[110:47.16]Oh, fuck.
[110:48.22]I gotta take a new picture.
[110:51.65]Hold on.
[110:55.79]Hold on to your, uh, hold on to your seats for a second.
[111:10.42]Right.
[111:14.96]New picture incoming.
[111:16.02]Alright.
[111:33.02]There we go.
[111:33.68]I don't want to move that.
[111:43.27]Which one?
[111:52.52]Nope.
[111:56.36]Top one's winning.
[112:01.64]It looks like it could be done with both.
[112:04.42]Bottom one's winning first so far, so... Okay.
[112:12.74]That one is selected.
[112:14.78]Pretty close, but... Which one?
[112:26.39]Doesn't even seem like a contest.
[112:28.31]Night vision goggles allow snipers to detect and shoot camo bloons.
[112:35.60]Alright.
[112:45.13]It looks like people want to do that again.
[112:51.31]Same thing on the other one, I think, is what the consensus will be.
[112:57.87]And it is.
[113:02.16]They can see the camouflage balloons now. 1700.
[113:14.94]I think that's it.
[113:19.76]Good luck!
[113:33.83]Yeah, it's on hard.
[113:36.43]This is on hard right now, it's not on easy.
[113:39.49]So, a couple of mistakes could end the whole thing.
[113:47.43]Alright, what now?
[113:54.79]Again?
[113:57.47]Again, it seems.
[114:05.10]Alright.
[114:05.74]Holy shit.
[114:08.50]I'm not fucking around here on this one.
[114:18.11]What round is this?
[114:22.39]He's getting up there.
[114:31.02]Bomb tower.
[114:32.88]Unlocked access to the missile launcher.
[114:37.26]What now?
[114:40.06]Ooh.
[114:41.72]Get the super monkey!
[114:42.86]Get the super monkey!
[114:46.06]I don't even need to pull the thing up.
[114:47.70]Look at this.
[114:48.06]It's so perfect.
[114:48.64]You guys are all over here.
[114:51.66]Now here's a really important thing.
[114:53.08]I'm gonna put the image on the screen.
[114:55.95]Where?
[115:08.98]Look at that.
[115:11.16]And not one person thought otherwise.
[115:18.85]That is 100%.
[115:19.09]Look at you guys working together.
[115:22.40]It's great.
[115:22.82]I love it.
[115:26.42]So right in the middle there, right kind of on the edge.
[115:31.14]I see what you're doing here.
[115:32.26]Alright.
[115:34.46]And there he is.
[115:41.97]Now what?
[115:52.41]$584.
[115:52.55]Looks like we're just gonna go.
[115:53.91]Looks like we're just gonna go.
[116:02.96]Yeah, there's a shitload of votes coming in here.
[116:08.85]Let's go.
[116:09.17]Oh, the Super Monkey goes 100 miles per hour.
[116:23.48]Damn.
[116:29.51]45 of 85.
[116:30.23]40 more rounds to go to beat the whole thing.
[116:34.55]I don't think anything's getting by this for a while.
[116:48.34]Somebody said I've never seen a super monkey before.
[116:52.42]You guys are playing really, actually, very well.
[116:58.02]Long round.
[116:58.74]Alright.
[116:59.02]Glue gunner level up.
[116:59.98]Corrosive glue.
[117:03.49]Monkey apprentice unlocked.
[117:06.65]All towers are unlocked.
[117:07.89]Oh, no.
[117:08.19]That's not even true.
[117:08.87]Alright.
[117:18.46]We have $3,000 to spend.
[117:23.66]Uh, enhance.
[117:27.44]Go again, please.
[117:28.16]Thank you.
[117:37.87]Seems to be the cannon.
[117:44.33]Because Super Monkey is down there, but cannon is over here.
[117:52.42]Although I can't, yeah, 49, 23.
[117:53.46]Cannon it is.
[117:54.30]Alright, there's really only one thing to do with a cannon.
[118:10.95]And that's missile launcher.
[118:15.43]Which is what you guys are clicking on.
[118:19.77]Missile launcher complete.
[118:25.23]I'm just the RTS narrator in a video game.
[118:31.21]Construction complete.
[118:33.37]Selecting.
[118:35.53]Super Monkey upgrade.
[118:40.92]Building constructed.
[118:48.14]This is pretty split here.
[118:49.58]2600?
[118:49.60]Another cannon?
[118:57.71]I guess so, yeah.
[119:01.42]52%, I think we're doing it again.
[119:02.54]Yeah.
[119:12.67]Two missile launchers ready to go, locked and loaded.
[119:28.81]Is this an enhanced scenario?
[119:34.57]It can't be.
[119:35.11]It has to be this.
[119:36.05]Because nothing can be upgraded here, so it has to be this one.
[119:41.97]Put on the red alert OST?
[119:43.53]Alright, I'll put on red alert OST.
[120:00.04]Red alert.
[120:05.62]Du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du-du.
[120:12.95]Sniper.
[120:15.53]Sour, please.
[120:17.13]What?
[120:17.33]Okay, how do you pronounce that?
[120:24.57]How am I?
[120:25.45]Is it sour, please?
[120:29.56]Are we still playing this?
[120:30.48]Because you guys haven't lost!
[120:36.01]Louder, louder.
[120:40.50]Alright, you ready?
[120:40.96]Is that all we can do?
[120:58.12]Seems pretty conflicted.
[120:59.08]50% want to buy something else.
[121:02.22]Alright.
[121:19.80]I think I know what you guys are going to pick here.
[121:27.09]A wizard.
[121:38.06]Alright, wizard it is.
[121:46.88]But where does it go?
[121:47.96]Please let me know where you'd like to put it.
[122:01.49]Looks like right... right behind the glue gunner.
[122:09.52]Zoom it out.
[122:14.22]You want it right behind the glue gunner, or do you want it somewhere else?
[122:16.11]Here we go.
[122:17.03]If you want it right behind the glue gunner there, then keep it there.
[122:30.81]Looks like you want it right there.
[122:32.01]Right here.
[122:32.91]The thing is, here...
[122:50.06]Lower, lower, lower.
[122:51.44]Alright, hold on.
[122:53.99]Let's be more... Can we be more precise on it?
[122:56.07]From here?
[123:03.88]Even lower than that.
[123:04.74]Like down there.
[123:07.04]With the image up.
[123:11.44]So you guys want it here.
[123:15.23]Like right there.
[123:26.43]Alright, here we go.
[123:30.35]Sure, why not?
[123:33.41]Alright, I can't take the Red Alert OST anymore.
[123:37.70]We need something calming.
[123:47.26]How about... How about 11 hours of ocean sounds?
[124:04.45]Alright, that sounds good.
[124:12.46]Alright, now what?
[124:23.22]Vessel, stop.
[124:25.23]Vessel, stop.
[124:28.71]Alright, let's go.
[124:31.00]MOAB class bloons, like MOABs, and even larger, require hundreds of hits to pop.
[124:36.24]Luckily for you, they tend to move more quickly.
[124:38.56]So this is a MOAB round.
[124:39.40]Are they gonna get it?
[124:50.83]Not even a problem.
[124:52.55]Everyone was so concerned about that.
[124:53.81]That was not even remotely an issue.
[124:58.23]Destroyed.
[124:58.85]Super Monkey has now laser blast eyes.
[125:05.09]What do you want?
[125:08.91]Super Monkey!
[125:11.11]Nah, there's not enough money!
[125:22.56]Not enough money.
[125:23.10]Gonna have to pick something else.
[125:32.10]Go again?
[125:32.72]Okay.
[125:43.36]Oh boy.
[125:50.55]No, it's still under control, somewhat.
[126:02.49]Still somewhat under control.
[126:07.73]Okay.
[126:07.89]Okay.
[126:09.84]Still, I know, is there enough money?
[126:11.60]Now everyone's like, alright, I'll do it.
[126:12.86]Uh-oh.
[126:16.16]Split decision.
[126:21.53]There are a lot of people that want to save money.
[126:24.17]There's also a lot of people that want to upgrade the Super Monkey right now.
[126:35.41]Hmm.
[126:39.39]You still can't do it.
[126:43.74]Super Monkey cannot be selected.
[126:45.24]It can't be upgraded.
[126:48.78]Would you like to try again?
[126:55.07]Well, you found a new monkey.
[127:06.98]Buy it during the round?
[127:08.08]Well, alright.
[127:08.98]Hey, wait, wait, wait.
[127:09.70]Okay.
[127:11.48]If you want me to buy the... Which one?
[127:14.46]This one?
[127:14.88]If you want me to buy this during the round, click up here.
[127:19.26]Do it up here.
[127:20.84]If you do not want me to do that, then pick a different thing.
[127:29.20]You ready?
[127:32.20]So click up here if you want me to do it in the middle of the round or something else.
[127:40.43]Damn.
[127:44.73]All righty then.
[127:49.44]Alright.
[127:50.74]Middle of the round we go.
[127:55.88]Would you like for me to proceed?
[128:03.27]OK.
[128:03.99]Just was making sure.
[128:08.15]Let's go.
[128:17.22]Strong, strong.
[128:18.06]I'm sorry, that was not selected.
[128:21.36]That wasn't the highest percentage.
[128:22.86]That's the one I clicked.
[128:32.91]Alright.
[128:33.75]Laser eyes.
[128:44.55]I think you guys are going to beat it.
[128:47.40]I really think so.
[128:54.92]Look at those la- that's the coolest thing ever.
[129:05.50]Well, there you go.

[129:15.99]Oh boy, it is.
[129:18.95]There's a lot of, uh... I don't know.
[129:22.01]We're gonna have to go in here.
[129:25.74]But, is there enough?
[129:27.20]Alright.
[129:27.94]You know where they are.
[129:29.40]I gotta move the, uh, the image.
[129:34.08]Alright, try to make it precise.
[129:38.16]It's gotta be fairly precise, wherever you're gonna click.
[129:52.10]This image is not accurate.
[129:57.60]Well... Okay.
[130:04.79]You definitely want to... It looks like you're clicking on the catapult.
[130:08.81]The spike-a-pult.
[130:12.39]That's what is being clicked on, absolutely.
[130:14.89]And I'm sorry to burst your bubble here, guys, but you cannot buy anything.
[130:22.03]No upgrades available.
[130:29.31]Oh, what would you like?
[130:41.64]Don't sell.
[130:45.40]Well, that's currently not what's... Okay, so it looks like you're selecting... Are you selecting this one?
[130:52.11]Get in there and tell me.
[130:53.63]Alright.
[131:05.28]Yes, that is the one.
[131:09.24]It is selected.
[131:12.06]What do you want me to do with it?
[131:20.24]Triple darts.
[131:23.80]Mmm, Spikapult.
[131:24.88]Could have two Spikapults at that point.
[131:30.46]Did I sell the Super Monkey?
[131:31.60]No, he's right here.
[131:34.04]Alright, we're gonna do triple darts.
[131:39.83]Almost at round... 50, right?
[131:43.55]Or more than that.
[131:51.23]Are we going?
[131:56.57]Alright, this is moved.
[131:57.35]Am I gonna fix this?
[132:02.64]Hold on.
[132:09.08]That was not... There we go.

[133:23.79]Longer cannons.
[133:28.06]Alright, lots of upgrades at round 50.
[133:31.92]Monkey Village.
[133:32.70]Monkey Village does not attack bloons, but instead lowers cost of all towers and upgrades by 10%.
[133:37.44]It has many useful upgrades that help nearby towers.
[133:40.02]Okay.
[133:40.76]Okay.
[133:41.97]that that's down even further.
[133:47.85]Alright.
[133:48.11]So if you want me to go down, we're going to think of another, of a solution here.
[133:55.67]If you, once I open up the list, if you want me to go down, you have to, let's see here.
[134:04.35]Yeah.
[134:04.61]If you, if you want me to go down, you got to click like over like here.
[134:13.89]If you want me to click on the down arrow.
[134:18.63]Alright.
[134:25.23]Round 50.
[134:29.51]Everyone's clicking over there.
[134:32.57]Take another picture.
[134:33.23]It's bothering me.
[134:34.29]Alright, let me get another screenshot.
[134:36.33]Let me clean this up.
[134:40.07]So, give me one second.

[142:53.24]Is this where it all falls apart?
[143:00.12]I'm going to refresh it.
[143:09.52]So much for the unity.
[143:18.89]It seems like we need to go over here.

[143:57.95]Call this Chat... Chat Plays Bloons TD5.
[144:12.71]Oh yeah, chat clicks BloonsTD5.
[144:21.91]That's a good one.
[144:23.81]Alright, we're gonna get the double shot.
[144:33.30]Clicks isn't capitalized?
[144:34.30]Ah, whatever.
[144:37.12]Do it again?
[144:37.48]You want them both?
[144:40.70]Sure?
[144:40.90]Sure?
[144:46.62]Strever is outsourcing entertainment.
[144:54.56]Alright.
[144:55.81]That's that.
[144:56.25]51.
[145:03.05]I'm going to refresh this again because I want to make sure you guys get this correctly.
[145:09.92]Hold on.
[145:17.09]You only get $599, what are you gonna do with it?
[145:24.23]Oh, okay, so you want to go over here and collect this.
[145:28.04]Okay.
[145:35.62]This is so dumb.
[145:44.57]Okay, are we ready for round 51?
[145:49.09]Seems that way.
[145:50.61]Here we go.
[146:12.79]So many clicks.
[146:24.30]Done.
[146:27.22]More level up.
[146:27.96]Cluster bombs are accessed.
[146:29.08]You get $3,500.
[146:34.58]Music?
[146:35.10]I muted it.
[146:35.60]Alright, I'm done with Minecraft.
[146:38.51]I don't want to hit the Minecraft OST anymore.
[146:40.75]Uh, how about, um... Hold on...
[147:07.37]Okay.
[147:11.85]Lot of indecision here, but mostly we're going over to here.
[147:15.87]Can't even upgrade them.
[147:17.79]You don't have enough money.
[147:18.47]It's better for you to sleep a little more.
[147:36.60]Thanks, I'll do it.
[147:38.98]It's John.
[147:41.52]I'm sorry, I didn't catch your name.
[147:43.58]Okay.
[147:44.88]Where are you from?
[147:47.27]I'm from the U.S.
[147:49.37]What do you want me to do here?
[147:50.73]I can't do anything with this.
[147:52.29]I'm on holiday.
[147:53.71]I have it selected.
[147:54.29]What do you want now?
[147:54.71]What's your phone number?
[147:57.15]Could I take your phone number?
[147:59.98]May I have your address?
[148:02.72]Are you on Facebook?
[148:05.36]Who do you live with?
[148:07.78]I live on my own.
[148:08.74]This is real creepy lady.
[148:10.22]I live with my friends.
[148:12.70]How old are you?
[148:15.04]I'm 30.
[148:15.26]What the fuck?
[148:17.31]When's your birthday?
[148:19.91]It's June 16th.
[148:25.64]Excuse me.
[148:26.44]Do you know where the bookstore is?
[148:27.84]No, I don't.
[148:28.93]Sorry.
[148:29.65]How can I get to the train station from here?
[148:31.97]Walk.
[148:33.35]Excuse me.
[148:33.91]Could you tell me how to get to the bus station?
[148:36.81]Ride your bike.
[148:37.53]Can you show me the way to the post office?
[148:40.04]Take a right.
[148:41.26]Excuse me.
[148:42.04]Where is the hospital?
[148:43.50]In front of you.
[148:44.68]Can you show me on the map?
[148:46.48]Right here.
[148:47.12]Look.
[148:47.64]What's the best way to get to the airport?
[148:50.16]Uh, by- Take an Uber.
[148:51.16]What's the fastest way to the airport?
[148:53.28]Get in an Uber.
[148:53.86]Get an Uber and it's quick.
[148:54.72]How far is it to the stadium from here?
[148:56.88]Uh, 15 miles.
[148:57.98]What street is this?
[148:59.44]This is, uh... Is this the way to the police station?
[149:02.40]No.
[149:03.09]You're on your way to the stadium.
[149:04.31]Is there a supermarket near here?
[149:05.69]There are.
[149:06.03]There are- Can you give me directions to the gas station?
[149:09.61]Yes.
[149:09.89]If you take a left at the end of this road and you go straight- Straight on.
[149:11.93]Yes, go straight ahead.
[149:12.57]That's right.
[149:13.31]Turn right at the crossroads.
[149:15.17]Yeah.
[149:15.71]Well, no, that's not correct.
[149:16.47]Keep going straight ahead for about 500 meters.
[149:18.65]No, no, no.
[149:19.21]I don't know why you're doing this.
[149:20.65]You asked me for directions.
[149:21.39]The bus station will be on your left.
[149:22.98]Well, that's where you should go then.
[149:24.04]You should go to the bus station and get on the bus.
[149:25.12]You're going the wrong way.
[149:26.14]I'm not driving a car.
[149:27.46]It's about one mile.
[149:28.64]We are not in a car together.
[149:34.26]What do you do?
[149:36.52]What do you do for a living?
[149:38.40]Online media.
[149:39.32]I've got a part-time job.
[149:40.86]Nice.
[149:42.22]Where do you work?
[149:44.56]I work from home.
[149:45.80]Me too.
[149:46.48]Hey, we got that in common.
[149:47.12]I work in a factory.
[149:48.04]How do you work from home in a factory?
[149:49.92]What is your occupation?
[149:52.28]I work as a doctor.
[149:54.88]I'm looking for a job.
[149:57.36]I'm a teacher.
[149:58.12]I'm not working at the moment.
[150:01.38]Oh, you've lost your mind, Lynn.
[150:02.62]I'm unemployed.
[150:04.96]I do the paperwork.
[150:07.54]I have my own business.
[150:10.38]Do you like your job?
[150:13.81]Yes, it's great.
[150:16.25]Damn, I agree too.
[150:17.77]I think that you should do what you like, have fun doing it.
[150:21.83]And, you know, if you make some money, make some money.
[150:24.57]You know what I'm saying?
[150:25.33]Right.
[150:25.59]I know, right?
[150:26.09]That's what I was trying to say.
[150:27.19]You're right!
[150:27.47]I know!
[150:27.77]That's what I just said!
[150:28.51]Me!
[150:42.82]Yes.
[150:47.00]We both think so, like... No, there isn't.
[150:52.52]Up to... Hold on a second here, hold on.
[150:55.85]No, that's... I don't know if I agree with you right there.
[150:57.85]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[151:01.21]Uh, well, I don't know how this turned so poorly, but I don't agree with you.
[151:10.00]That's a dumb thing to say.
[151:11.53]Yeah, I'm not entirely sure about this.
[151:15.10]No, neither do I.
[151:17.44]I don't fucking agree with you.
[151:18.92]I totally disagree.
[151:20.30]Yeah, you're an idiot, an imbecile.
[151:22.14]I'm sorry, but I disagree.
[151:23.54]No, you should not be trusted ever.
[151:25.10]Absolutely not.
[151:26.28]No, you get out of my house.
[151:27.16]How about that?
[151:27.64]I invited you over here.
[151:29.40]You took the fucking bus here, lady.
[151:31.26]That's not right.
[151:32.08]Yeah, and you asked for directions and I tried to give you directions.
[151:34.02]That's not always true.
[151:35.04]No, yes it is because I gave you directions earlier and you didn't care.
[151:37.46]Yes, it was what happened, so stop fucking interrupting me.
[151:39.40]No, that's not true.
[151:40.02]That is what happened, so stop fucking interrupting me.
[151:42.11]No way.
[151:42.61]Yes, it is.
[151:44.82]You knocked on my door and you asked for fucking directions to- Do you understand?
[151:49.68]Are you following me?
[151:52.21]Do you understand what I mean?
[151:53.55]Are we ready for the next?
[152:01.47]Are you ready?
[152:04.35]What are we doing now?
[152:05.01]Is this tax or is this go?
[152:13.92]I'm not sure.
[152:21.53]Alright, you want this?
[152:24.59]Looks like we're gonna go.
[152:33.49]Here comes the next round.
[152:51.90]This fits pretty well.
[152:59.97]You guys have made an unstoppable team here.
[153:01.55]They can't do anything.
[153:02.16]We gotta go faster.
[153:03.66]Ooh, Moab.
[153:24.18]Pretty good.
[153:29.09]What are we doing now?
[153:41.05]Super Monkey?
[153:43.77]We doing Laser 2.0?
[153:50.14]I can really start to follow your guys' mindset here.
[153:52.52]It's great.
[153:58.70]Oh yeah, of course.
[153:59.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[154:03.18]Are people seeing other monkey?
[154:04.36]I can't do other monkey.
[154:06.67]This is the only one we can do.
[154:13.23]Okay, make sure we're sure about this.
[154:15.35]Because I'm seeing some descent here.
[154:19.18]Here we go.
[154:26.56]I completely disagree with you.
[154:30.26]I'm not so sure about that.
[154:33.66]The vessel is starting to turn into a leader.
[154:35.21]It's time to revolt.
[154:44.77]Alright.
[154:46.47]You guys got a chance to double check to see if you want to do it.
[154:49.55]And here you go.
[154:51.67]Good luck.
[155:07.61]We need to anoint a new vessel.
[155:09.53]This stream keeps getting worse.
[155:11.78]What?
[155:11.98]Why?
[155:14.22]The streams are getting worse.
[155:42.32]I already know what you guys want me to do.
[155:53.89]Plasma.
[155:55.63]Plasma blasts.
[155:57.70]Plasma vaporizes everything it touches.
[155:59.96]That's it, I can't afford anything else.
[156:04.42]You guys, that's it, you're done.
[156:23.59]over here what is happening over here why are people losing their minds over here and this 37% of you don't agree alright let's go
[156:52.89]Look at that plasma ray.
[157:04.68]We've only done five rounds in 30 minutes.
[157:08.42]Because the rounds are getting more difficult, so they need to have more deliberation.
[157:26.94]Uh, Buccaneer level up.
[157:29.38]Super Monkey level up.
[157:32.96]56.
[157:35.57]Where to?
[157:37.83]Okay, I can't take this anymore.
[157:39.95]How about, uh... Epic?
[157:49.89]Epic?
[157:54.71]Put on RuneScape music.
[158:08.00]RuneScape music?
[158:11.92]I've never even played RuneScape.
[158:13.32]It has music?
[158:20.28]Here you go.
[158:25.29]Alright, looks like Buccaneer.
[158:26.55]I'm going to refresh it just because everyone was clicking on other stuff.
[158:41.54]Here we go.
[158:50.54]Can we please play RuneScape after this?
[158:54.09]No, this is it for tonight.
[158:56.23]Alright, the people have spoken.
[159:09.81]Three, two, one, bring it up.
[159:15.88]Ah, the other one too, longer cannon.
[159:22.48]Three, two, one, here it comes.
[159:31.68]Uh, looks like Super Monkey?
[159:33.57]Which one?
[159:35.09]Could be either.
[159:35.57]I think it's this one, though.
[159:37.69]It could be really either one of them.
[159:48.70]Doesn't matter which one?
[159:54.01]This seems to have more votes.
[160:05.30]Are you guys sure?
[160:05.76]Is this Yoshi's Story?
[160:12.18]Okay.
[160:21.45]Time to start.
[160:24.24]Let's go!
[160:43.23]Nothing even stands a chance!
[160:44.35]Nothing even stands a chance!
[160:46.81]Did you see that shit?
[160:47.69]Nothing even stands a chance right now!
[160:49.61]It's 57, I almost said level 60!
[161:01.27]It's just too easy for you guys.
[161:02.67]You guys are making this look simple.
[161:08.98]Alright, we're going again.
[161:35.46]Masterfully done, guys.
[161:39.71]Balloon Dissolver for Glue Gunner.
[161:43.59]Moab Mauler.
[161:46.13]And rank up Mortar Tower.
[161:48.60]Rank 17.
[161:49.00]There it is.
[161:51.42]Here's the down arrow.
[161:53.16]You get the Village, the Banana Farm, and Mortar Tower.
[161:59.14]Level 58.
[162:02.07]I got faith in you guys.
[162:08.49]Looks like it's split between... I feel bad for all the people that want to upgrade the wizard so bad, but they have never had an opportunity to.
[162:19.22]Alright, we are opening up.
[162:21.44]Ooh.
[162:22.90]1, 2, 3, 4.
[162:23.10]We got 14, 12, 11, 15.
[162:24.40]Look at all the percentages here.
[162:28.28]Half of the whole entire stream right now does not want to do this, but that's what happens.
[162:34.55]Maybe we gotta stick with what we're doing.
[162:42.54]Okay, let's open it up.
[162:44.30]Which tower do you want?
[162:48.42]And again, keep in mind, remember, if you want me to go down, you need to select over here.
[162:56.65]Ready?
[163:06.26]Jesus.
[163:08.09]Yeah, over here.
[163:08.92]If you want me to click the down arrow.
[163:11.24]But then we'd run into another problem where I need this... I'm gonna have to do this in a different way.
[163:19.60]Alright, so it looks like I'm going down.
[163:23.66]But hold on here.
[163:28.49]So let's go down.
[163:32.07]So, if you want the village, click up here.
[163:37.35]If you want the banana farm, click up here.
[163:39.99]And if you want the mortar tower, click down here.
[163:42.83]You understand?
[163:44.71]Go.
[163:59.87]Looks like it's gonna be the village.
[164:06.39]By a lot, actually, so.
[164:08.28]Alright.
[164:08.56]Where do you want it?
[164:14.24]Where do you want the village?
[164:15.70]Let's see, do we need to zoom in for this?
[164:19.64]We might not even need to.
[164:20.66]You guys want it right in here, but I don't think I can fit it here.
[164:24.30]It's too crowded.
[164:29.62]I could get it right there.
[164:30.40]Let's enhance.
[164:30.97]Let's enhance.
[164:36.97]What do you want?
[164:41.01]There's a second Super Monkey, though.
[164:42.79]Just be aware of that.
[164:44.70]Below the first Super Monkey.
[164:56.21]The stream will never end.
[165:09.33]Alright.
[165:14.03]Right next to the bottom left of the glue gunner?
[165:17.15]That's close.
[165:24.45]That's so close.
[165:25.68]I'm going to refresh it again.
[165:29.26]Alright, you ready?
[165:32.48]Go for it again.
[165:55.11]well you've spoken it's going above so right here that's as close as I can get it right there okay anything else
[166:24.46]Why is RuneScape 07 music playing?
[166:28.00]That's a great question.
[166:30.42]Somebody wrote it in chat and I clicked on it.
[166:32.18]I think we have to zoom in for this.
[166:36.22]Yeah, try it again.
[166:51.97]Uh, so that's the second Super Monkey, right?
[166:58.22]From my understanding.
[167:04.88]So you guys are selecting the second Super Monkey.
[167:08.47]Or is it the glue?
[167:22.99]Alright, if you want this super... I'm going to have to take another picture.
[167:28.52]This is the slowest stream I'm trying.
[167:31.16]It's hard.
[167:33.66]I'm going to have to go more zoom on this.
[167:48.63]Alright, show me.
[167:53.97]Remember, the super monkey, there's another super monkey down there, right?
[167:56.55]Yeah, there you go.
[168:07.66]A wizard it is.
[168:10.58]After, like, 30 rounds of people wanting to upgrade.
[168:15.59]There's only one wizard upgrade.
[168:20.05]I'm pretty sure I know which one it is.
[168:25.41]What the fuck did I do to this?
[168:26.31]Alright, there's only one wizard upgrade.
[168:47.02]Whoa, whoa, whoa, wait a minute.
[168:48.58]What's going on here?
[168:55.66]Sell the wizard.
[169:00.17]Holy shit.
[169:01.17]Okay.
[169:01.57]I thought that's surprising.
[169:08.86]Might be strong.
[169:09.72]Yeah, you're right.
[169:10.12]It might be.
[169:11.10]But not even going to need to see it.
[169:12.48]$2,250.
[169:14.98]Where are we off to?
[169:28.75]This seems like a go scenario.
[169:30.31]Round 58.
[169:30.71]Is that the Glover soundtrack?
[169:53.96]How do you even know what that game is?
[170:14.89]There's a video that I made 10 years ago?
[170:16.29]I never made a video on Glover.
[170:17.63]I don't think I did.
[170:24.04]What the hell is happening?
[170:28.28]What was that?
[170:29.58]Why'd they go back?
[170:34.95]That was... The wizard power makes them go backwards?
[170:38.93]Now I know why everybody wanted to vote for that.
[170:44.63]Alright, I'm gonna sneeze.
[170:45.37]And I'm sorry about it.
[170:47.13]I have a mute button, I forgot.
[170:52.73]Alright, I'm gonna turn off the Castlevania 2 music.
[171:05.31]And let's get... Uh, there's a lot of... I don't know what people want in here.
[171:19.78]FTL soundtrack?
[171:20.94]I've never even played FTL.
[171:30.15]Okay.
[171:32.25]Uh, zooming in.
[171:36.51]There's a lot of people clicking here, so... Try it again.
[171:54.05]Looks like we're going over here.
[171:56.10]To the left?
[172:01.46]Uh, doesn't matter which one, I can only upgrade the left one.
[172:11.51]So, left one it is, because the right one cannot be upgraded.
[172:14.45]So left one, which one do you want?
[172:24.13]Flash bomb or double shot.
[172:26.99]Flash bomb is very expensive.
[172:29.15]Sometimes throws a flash bomb that stuns balloons in a large radius.
[172:37.23]Hopefully you spent that money wisely.
[172:44.14]Can't do anything else there.
[172:46.64]Round 59.
[172:54.43]Alright, let's go.
[173:12.18]We're gonna be here for hours.
[173:19.21]I don't know.
[173:23.72]It could go either way, because from 60 and beyond, I think is when it's going to start to get actually very difficult.
[173:33.63]We won.
[173:34.13]It's time to stop.
[173:36.45]We can't stop now.
[173:37.79]That would be a huge mistake.
[173:42.77]Okay.
[173:54.54]Uh, we're... 100% want to go right to the village.
[173:56.64]86%.
[174:02.64]This is probably like 70% right here.
[174:04.86]Alright.
[174:12.09]Beacon.
[174:12.37]Increase attack range of all towers within the monkey village.
[174:17.11]Okay.
[174:21.03]Where to next?
[174:28.16]Tactical Hivemind.
[174:34.83]What is being clicked on over here?
[174:44.71]By a special agent.
[174:49.64]I'm not sure if this is the Super Monkey or the Glue Gunner.
[174:53.36]Let me go ahead and zoom it in.
[175:03.26]Which one is this?
[175:05.00]Which one are you clicking on here?
[175:12.27]Glue gunner, okay.
[175:19.29]He is selected.
[175:19.91]What would you like to do with him?
[175:32.96]Alright.
[175:33.64]Balloon Dissolver.
[175:34.64]$877.
[175:34.66]Don't think there's not much else you guys can do.
[175:48.29]Good luck.
[175:55.79]What is that?
[175:56.47]Okay, that's the Super Moab.
[176:02.42]The Super MOAB turns into five regular MOABs?
[176:11.20]Just decimated.
[176:12.64]Absolutely decimated.
[176:14.56]That could have been really scary, but it wasn't at all.
[176:16.67]Not at all.
[176:26.15]Again!
[176:26.63]Go again!
[176:27.21]Sure thing!
[176:27.75]Let's go!
[176:44.50]This is the coolest tower.
[176:49.57]Getting carried through bloons.
[176:55.85]Hey, look at this shit.
[176:56.69]They can't even do anything.
[176:59.31]Apprentice level up lightning bolt.
[177:00.59]62 of 85.
[177:01.67]4600 bucks.
[177:02.19]And we are going to... Looks like it wants...
[177:14.50]I think this is a living entity.
[177:15.84]Okay, it wants to select the wizard, I think.
[177:22.92]Yeah, this is definitely on the wizard.
[177:25.58]This is probably 70 or 80% of the vote over here.
[177:27.98]And I guarantee it's the zap.
[177:35.76]It is.
[177:36.48]Would you look at that.
[177:37.04]Unleash the power of lightning to zap many balloons at once.
[177:46.49]But that's what you like to do.
[177:49.17]Oh, this is getting interesting.
[177:50.03]Okay, now we're... Buying a special agent.
[177:54.28]Not yet.
[177:54.90]No.
[177:56.70]Looked like it for a second.
[178:07.06]Okay.
[178:09.17]This is... Epic range is the only thing to buy here.
[178:18.88]Even bigger range.
[178:19.68]74%.
[178:19.70]73%.
[178:22.36]Okay.
[178:22.84]Anything else?
[178:23.88]Chat sucks.
[178:25.76]What?
[178:25.90]Here's round 62.
[178:53.72]No, I didn't say that.
[178:54.48]I was just quoting what somebody said.
[179:08.15]Music change?
[179:08.73]I'll do it after this.
[179:23.16]Nothing can even get by.
[179:26.40]This is probably going to go all the way.
[179:29.34]They can't even come down the first lane.
[179:32.74]Excellent placement here, guys.
[179:36.02]For real.
[179:37.55]Nice work.
[179:39.94]Sun God for the Super Monkey.
[179:41.36]It is said that bloons who doth touch the sun shall be cleansed and then there shall be peace.
[179:46.86]Sun God.
[179:50.26]Monkey Fort.
[179:51.86]Cruises Popping Power by 1.
[179:55.06]And then Dartling Gun.
[179:57.40]Darts like a machine gun.
[180:05.04]Alright, guys.
[180:07.60]What's the plan here?
[180:14.62]Uh, 66% of you want to go in this area here.
[180:21.45]I'm going to zoom it in.
[180:22.11]Remember the Super Monkey is down here.
[180:23.73]Click down there if you want to.
[180:26.17]Because I don't know exactly where everyone wants to go.
[180:30.95]And remember, there's a fort up here too.
[180:38.32]You get the missile launch, the fort is up to the top right, and then below the first super monkey is the other super monkey.
[180:43.34]Understand?
[180:43.68]Alright, make it happen.
[180:52.09]Fort?
[181:02.64]Alright, fort it is.
[181:05.52]Fortnight.
[181:08.31]There's only one thing to buy, I'm gonna assume that's what you guys want.
[181:17.55]It is.
[181:17.79]So this has increased the popping power of all the towers nearby by one.
[181:20.43]1971.
[181:20.91]Okay.
[181:37.17]Pretty good.
[181:37.87]Round 63 incoming.
[181:41.47]Wait, we need new music.
[181:44.33]Okay.
[181:49.82]You guys need to seriously, like, listen up.
[181:55.92]I want everybody to get up for this one.
[181:57.97]I want you all to stand the fuck up.
[182:03.55]Everyone get up.
[182:15.44]Woohoo!
[182:18.00]Oh, come on!
[182:20.56]Get it up for me!
[182:23.16]Woohoo!
[182:26.94]I'll set you down!
[182:37.07]I got four words for you!
[182:40.55]I love this company!
[182:42.91]Yeah!
[183:00.83]Let's go!
[183:04.71]Okay, good work.
[183:07.84]64 out of 85.
[183:15.75]Was that an office joke?
[183:18.85]No.
[183:59.20]You guys have never seen that video?
[184:00.44]Come on.
[184:00.82]It's like original meme status.
[184:04.22]Come on, guys.
[184:07.36]And then... I have four words for you.
[184:17.23]I love this company.
[184:21.65]Yes!
[184:26.89]I don't know why I did that.
[184:27.85]I'm not sure what the reason to do that was, but I did it.
[184:31.37]Alright, where we going?
[184:34.95]That is such old shit.
[184:36.63]Uh, whatever.
[184:44.07]Which one are we going to?
[184:47.03]You guys are gonna beat this fucking whole thing.
[184:57.74]Looks like we're going right to the glue gunner.
[185:02.05]This is gonna take us two hours.
[185:08.37]Alright, glue gunner it is, but that... No, it's not glue gunner.
[185:11.09]I can't... There's no... You can't buy anything.
[185:13.63]Look.
[185:18.54]Glue upgrade is... This path is closed, and this one's rank 27.
[185:26.27]I'm sorry, guys, but you can't do that right now.
[185:32.79]Now what?
[185:37.40]Nothing here?
[185:39.18]The only thing that you can possibly do here, in this whole area, is you got either, your options are wizard, or super monkey.
[185:50.44]You don't have enough money or enough rank to do anything else.
[185:54.72]If you want a wizard on this next refresh, click down here.
[186:01.03]You can do both?
[186:04.97]325, you can do both.
[186:05.65]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[186:11.71]No, I get you.
[186:20.64]So let's do the wizard first.
[186:24.10]Wizard upgrade!
[186:24.86]There it is.
[186:25.32]And super upgrade.
[186:27.80]But do you guys actually want me to do this?
[186:31.56]Do you want that second super monkey?
[186:40.77]People are going down here.
[186:48.03]Now that all the people that got their wizard upgrade, they're like, no, no, no, no, no.
[186:51.23]Fuck that.
[186:51.65]We're doing an agent.
[186:52.95]That's what happens, man.
[186:58.76]Okay.
[187:01.56]I have no idea what any of this shit is.
[187:05.43]Turtle.
[187:06.97]Bloomsday device.
[187:08.43]Mirror.
[187:08.75]How much...
[187:16.69]Okay, close it, obviously.
[187:18.37]I don't have any money.
[187:19.51]I only have zero dollars.
[187:26.76]You guys found the microtransactions and you immediately closed the window.
[187:29.92]I love it.
[187:33.86]And that's like, alright, you know, I guess we could do the upgrade.
[187:37.43]Okay, fine.
[187:49.23]Round 64.
[187:49.51]Is it just only gonna be MOABs now?
[188:14.53]Cripple MOAB.
[188:15.81]Okay.
[188:22.64]That doesn't sound good.
[188:23.42]Let me see the general direction that you guys want to go on this one.
[188:28.68]Let's put on... Where's the music?
[188:32.51]Hold on, I'll get it.
[188:33.59]I'm going.
[188:34.47]I'm working on it.
[188:40.55]Spore?
[188:43.17]Spyro?
[188:46.49]Katamari?
[188:47.01]I'm going to play that, by the way.
[188:51.11]Let's get a sneak peek of Katamari Damacy, because I'm definitely going to play the re-made one.
[189:03.30]This has one of the best soundtracks of any video game ever.
[189:07.42]Alright, where are we going?
[189:12.42]Over here, right into the... We don't have enough money for this.
[189:16.74]Sniper can't be upgraded.
[189:19.61]This can't be upgraded.
[189:21.03]None of this over here can be upgraded, guys.
[189:24.95]You don't have very many choices.
[189:26.01]Yeah, your only option to upgrade anything is down the bottom here to the boomerang.
[189:37.86]So... Try again.
[189:54.12]Here we go.
[189:59.00]65.
[190:09.39]Do not sell the boomerang.
[190:11.19]It's not my decision to make.
[190:12.85]Sorry.
[190:26.47]This is the best song of the whole album.
[190:29.11]This is the best one.
[191:12.41]Did it 66 out of 85 I am impressed
[191:40.95]Oh boy, alright, we got... It's either these people wanting the Super Monkey Upgrade Plasma or... Jungle Drums.
[192:09.18]I'm gonna... Sorry, all those of you that want to go over here.
[192:11.68]I'm sorry about that, but it's all split over here.
[192:13.89]Alright, if you want Super Monkey, put your vote down here.
[192:20.09]Everyone else, do what you were doing before.
[192:35.87]uh looks like we're doing the village alright that's the only up here to do jungle drums inspire neighbor towers to attack faster
[193:07.93]Oh, shit.
[193:09.77]I see people.
[193:10.59]This is... Whoa, hold on here.
[193:18.35]This is... I think people want another tower.
[193:27.22]Is that... Hmm.
[193:33.58]Alright.
[193:35.26]Another tower coming up.
[193:40.26]Remember, if you want to scroll down, you gotta go over here.
[193:43.88]Holy shit, okay, we're going down?
[194:01.29]So, what do you guys want here?
[194:03.37]I need, like, two screenshots.
[194:06.80]Alright, if you want...
[194:09.68]Monkey Village.
[194:11.06]Go over here.

[194:21.02]Mortar Tower, down here.
[194:26.80]Dartling Gunner, down here.
[194:28.06]And if you want this, then go up here.
[194:31.74]Like, actually just put it here.
[194:35.92]So again, just think of it in the corners, right?
[194:37.85]Monkey Village, up here.
[194:40.21]Banana Farm, up here.
[194:42.09]Mortar Tower, down here.

[194:59.64]Holy fuck, you guys want a Spike Factory?
[195:02.72]Nobody wants anything else.
[195:06.40]I have 75 IQ, these instructions are confusing me.
[195:11.90]Alright, looks like we're doing Dart, uh, Spike Factory.
[195:20.83]Spike Factory it is, and where the hell is this even gonna go?
[195:31.43]Over here.
[195:31.89]66 of 85, coming up.
[195:41.61]Looks like it's going right here.
[195:48.51]Okay.
[195:48.75]I don't think you have any money for anything else.
[196:00.51]Maybe not, who knows.

[196:42.90]Uh, cluster bomb tower level up.
[196:46.10]67 of 85.
[196:46.46]You're very close.
[196:48.06]Less than 20.
[196:48.52]Uh, some people want to go, and some people want to upgrade.
[197:02.17]Very conflicted in here of what to upgrade.
[197:07.19]Then I hate to burst everybody's bubble over here, but, uh,
[197:12.59]Mmm, can't afford anything There we go 67
[197:47.87]Almost at 69.
[197:49.09]Oh, I see what you mean.

[198:23.84]$4,800.
[198:30.17]Should have enough to do a couple things here.
[198:31.55]82% look like they want to go up here.
[198:37.76]That's a large number up here.
[198:45.69]Excuse me, vessel, please increase volume.
[198:48.71]Increasing volume.
[198:50.49]Job done.
[198:51.89]Okay.
[198:58.25]Yeah, getting the radar.
[199:01.02]Radar scanner allows all towers within this radius to be able to detect and target camo balloons.

[201:05.21]Peter.
[201:06.05]We're at the endgame now, Peter.

[201:28.90]New tower.
[201:29.42]Okay.
[201:42.16]Remember, if you want me to go down, you know where to click.
[201:47.56]Alright, for this one, I actually can't say them.
[201:55.70]Dax.
[201:56.48]Alright, so here's what's going to happen with this, okay?
[202:03.48]You want me to go down, I'm going to scroll this down, but just pretend that this is here.
[202:12.33]You know what I mean?
[202:13.43]Replace all these icons with the ones that are in front of you right now.
[202:21.16]So with that being said, imagine that it's all scrolled down.
[202:24.60]Just replace the icons on the right with the ones that are in the middle.
[202:27.66]Good luck.
[202:37.08]So this is monkey sub is this one.
[202:49.51]Some of you guys are helping, it's great.

[203:15.44]Over here?
[203:16.60]Over here?
[203:20.07]We just need the king of the cosmos doing his record scratch talking.
[203:31.81]This is as close as I can get it right here.
[203:35.69]That's right in the middle.
[203:37.96]It can't go on land, so it can't go over here.
[203:39.66]It has to go either... No, it can't even go over here.
[203:43.64]It has to go here or here.
[203:49.14]Reset it.
[204:00.56]Wha- What's going on up here?
[204:04.06]I can't fit it there.
[204:05.26]It's gotta be right here.
[204:07.82]In the one little spot, which is right... here... This is the only spot it can go.
[204:21.28]I'm putting it down.
[204:25.78]I'm putting it down!
[204:27.30]I'm putting it down!
[204:33.40]Damn it.
[204:38.51]Hold on.
[204:40.27]It's too close.
[204:42.71]Too close to call here.
[204:46.87]Show me.
[204:59.68]Alright.
[205:00.46]Right down there.
[205:01.16]You got it.
[205:08.31]It's been placed.
[205:09.88]Thanks for the clarification.
[205:23.57]More?
[205:23.97]What else can we do?
[205:27.11]Can't do anything else.
[205:35.29]Alright.
[205:36.62]Final 15, good luck.
[205:58.82]Speed it up.

[206:03.80]This easy mode.
[206:10.69]Super Monkey Fan Club.
[206:13.77]Converts up to 10 nearby dart monkeys into super monkeys.
[206:16.17]If it's an ability, I can't click them.

[206:45.27]Tornado it is.
[206:52.87]Anything else?
[206:56.67]No, I can't do this.

[214:40.75]Wasn't there a video game that came out with the narrator that had a low voice and there was a party of four people and they went and they trekked through dangerous dungeons?
[214:48.86]And there was a big warning there about overconfidence being a very slow, slow bleed.
[214:54.77]Be careful here.
[214:55.43]Uh-oh!
[215:04.53]Is this the end?
[215:05.96]Could this be the end?

[218:36.88]Please choose what you would like me to click with a clean slate.
[219:00.06]Oh, alright.
[219:04.40]This is where we are.
[219:07.30]But why are we clicking this?

[220:10.02]Okay.
[220:11.40]It seems that chat has moved from here to here.
[220:17.01]That is the consensus.

[270:32.22]No, I don't, I don't think so.
[270:36.23]A game that I knew was bad, but I was, I mean, maybe, I don't know, Diablo 3?
[270:40.05]Does that count?
[270:46.79]That counts, right?
[270:50.12]Because there was a point where I just, like, hated Diablo 3 and, like, the position that it was in, especially, like, a couple months after launch.
[270:57.48]I thought it was like, oh, wow, this is really cool.
[270:59.90]The initial six hours of Diablo 3, the initial, like, 10 hours or 15 hours was like, oh, this is, oh, cool, cool.
[271:08.14]This is actually kind of fun.
[271:10.02]And then after, like, I put 50 to 100 hours into the game, after, like, two months, three months of the game being live, I hated it.
[271:20.62]And that was in the middle of the real money auction house.
[271:23.80]The game was a fucking mess.
[271:28.30]No, close.
[271:29.37]You had 6% on the M. What's going on there?
[271:34.57]But... The Diablo 3 expansion... Yeah, I gave up on it for a while and then Reaper of Souls came out.
[271:43.83]Made the game 10,000 times better.
[271:46.95]And then the ga- I don't think the ga- the game at this point, they've just kind of been tacking on so much shit on top of, uh, everything that's already there.
[271:56.55]That, uh, it's, it's kind of very, there's rift, rift, rift, rift, rift, rift, rift.
[272:00.85]That's really all there is in the game at this point now, and for me at least.
[272:06.54]But, if that answers your question, I hope so.
[272:09.40]But I did get a lot of play time in Diablo 3.
[272:12.87]Hey, thank you, uh, Queso, for the $1, uh, for the sock fun.
[272:16.38]Thanks a lot.
[272:17.86]WombatFromHell, thanks for the $1 stream.
[272:19.58]Reminded me of this video.
[272:26.27]Shopper cracking contra- Wallace and Gromit shopping- cracking contraptions.
[272:31.71]Shopper 13.
[272:32.01]Jeez, Gromit.
[272:32.31]Go for the big one.
[272:43.08]Thank you, Wombat from hell.
[272:45.16]Pie Guy, thanks for the $1.50.
[272:46.38]This should help cover the cost.
[272:47.32]Thank you.
[272:47.82]Bats, thank you for the bits.
[272:49.65]Thanks for the laughs.
[272:50.43]Thank you for being here.
[272:52.85]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.00.
[272:53.91]Please do a Christmas shopping stream where we choose what you actually buy for your family.
[273:01.69]That would be very interesting, but I kind of have to be careful.
[273:06.40]For very obvious reasons.
[273:08.84]So... I mean, if I could set that up in a way where that's possible...
[273:16.46]I need to be careful with that one.
[273:19.30]That's interesting.
[273:24.92]Thank you, Lazy Luke, for a pretty good idea.
[273:31.64]Kim Plex, thanks for the $1.
[273:34.30]You must purchase more for our entertainment and enjoyment.
[273:37.41]Thank you.
[273:40.10]Actually, it would be kind of fun, maybe, one day to set something crazy like that up, but not for today.
[273:46.57]Thank you, Novi, for the $3.33 whale funds.
[273:49.63]Thank you.
[273:52.17]Heathcliff the Friday Thriller, thanks for the $2.
[273:54.53]Ho ho ho, Heathcliff here, number one funny cat.
[273:58.95]I was at my- don't do this to me.
[274:01.14]Another one of you guys is making, like, a cat- comic book cat RP character.
[274:06.84]Heathcliff the Friday Thriller.
[274:11.34]I was at my local sandwich bar wondering what sandwich to buy.
[274:14.72]Boy, oh boy, was it one tough cookie choice.
[274:16.96]In times like these, I follow with one simple rule.
[274:19.53]WWJ do.
[274:20.31]What would Jerma do?
[274:21.03]Turkey or tuna?
[274:21.77]I picked turkey.
[274:22.83]And then I went to the KFC to order a tub of gravy.
[274:25.19]Just gravy and poured that over the delicious turkey sandwich.
[274:27.25]Don't knock it until you try it.
[274:28.27]P.S.
[274:29.03]Nice internet purchases.
[274:30.01]Would you consider buying Heathcliff merchandise?
[274:31.96]Okay.
[274:34.10]Uh, thank you, Jin, for the five community subs.
[274:37.50]Coming in much earlier, seven hours ago now.
[274:39.42]Thank you, Jin.
[274:40.48]Thank you, Pin.
[274:41.22]Pinman gave a shitload, and they gave a shitload earlier.
[274:46.98]Ten community subs from Pin.
[274:55.19]Thank you so much, Pin.
[274:59.30]And then right after that, Garfield the Monday Killer comes in for a dollar.
[275:02.74]Jerma, I hope you realize that giving chat control of where you click is like inviting an army of demons to invade your brain.
[275:08.78]If chat had their way, we'd have you purchase 30 copies of Garfield Fat Cat 3-Pack.
[275:13.79]I'm astounded at how long... I have a fucking... That's a... You know what?
[275:16.47]Fuck it.
[275:16.71]We're gonna do that someday.
[275:18.71]I'm going to load on a, like, separate Amazon account.
[275:25.83]Like, $200 in Amazon money.
[275:30.62]Good luck.
[275:31.74]That would be like fucking crazy.
[275:33.60]Looking over at the percentages here and I'm seeing M is at 4%.
[275:36.02]Come on, guys.
[275:45.43]Go to eBay now.
[275:55.29]But thank you, Garfield.
[275:56.01]Thank you, Smellyboy, for the $1.
[275:57.27]You played A Courage of the Cowardly Dog Creepypasta.
[276:00.59]Touched on it earlier, but that was funny.
[276:02.31]Thank you.
[276:04.10]SuperSeal, thanks for the $1.
[276:05.42]A plus stream.
[276:06.10]Jerma, thank you.
[276:08.66]It was an interesting idea from somebody in the chat that said, play Flash games.
[276:14.88]And then I was like, hey, why don't I just give control to everybody?
[276:18.14]Why don't I just pick what games I play?
[276:20.16]And then we played fucking three Flash games.
[276:22.82]What even happened on this stream?
[276:27.19]I don't even remember.
[276:27.95]That was like seven and a half... That was seven hours of... I don't remember.
[276:35.82]Technically, it was two guys.
[276:37.06]That's very correct.
[276:41.80]Thank you to DoubleD11 for the $1.
[276:43.82]I graciously thank you for choosing me in my game.
[276:46.69]Oh, DoubleD?
[276:48.65]That's Ed.
[276:50.57]Is that what your name is based off of?
[276:54.03]Counting meme, thanks for the $10, 999, $9.99.
[276:56.13]Hey, Jerma longtime fan, keep up the good work.
[276:59.33]I'm running out of generic things to say.
[277:03.75]And then he says, gave one bit to Bob Ross.
[277:07.85]Well, thank you, counting meme, for the $10.
[277:13.14]Fat, fat, what is this?
[277:23.10]fat fatten said fatten said thanks for the ten dollars they say we want the nose the nose

[278:36.30]Thank you so much.
[278:40.08]And then... Sferg comes in with a t-shirt link.
[278:47.82]This is not a real t-shirt.
[278:50.41]I don't want to link anybody to any fake websites.
[278:53.59]But thank you for the $1.
[278:54.23]Moosky, thanks for the $5, Moosky.
[278:59.23]Appreciate it.

[279:22.50]Okay.

[279:48.14]Thank you.
[279:51.72]Sferg, thanks for the $1.
[279:52.96]New Vegas streamer single-handedly beats 5,000 people at checkers.

[279:58.10]And then you guys got insta-checkmated in chess.
[280:03.65]I don't forget that one.
[280:04.55]I remember that.
[280:11.43]Thank you, though.
[280:13.47]Thank you, Other Guy, for the $1.
[280:15.77]I haven't laughed this hard in a long time.

[280:20.39]Thanks for hanging out.
[280:24.57]The Helping Llama, thanks for the $1.
[280:26.01]Welcome to Jerma Park, Jerma Raptor.
[280:28.97]Jerma Raptor is not a current emote, but thank you nonetheless.
[280:37.42]Thank you, SuperSeal, for the $1.
[280:39.10]I like how it took one guy to get you to install the extension, but despite all the messages, you still don't have BTTV.
[280:51.11]I don't want BTTV.
[280:52.34]Why the fuck?
[281:04.93]Thank you, SuperSoup, for the $1.
[281:06.21]Thank you, Flying Sombrero, for the $1.

[281:19.26]For the $10 here.
[281:24.02]No messages?
[281:24.62]Thank you.
[281:24.94]Appreciate that.
[281:27.62]Thanks a lot.
[281:30.48]$10 coming in.
[281:32.64]That was a lot of fun.
[281:33.22]Thanks for hanging out.
[281:33.82]Thanks for participating.
[281:34.50]Hey, you guys are making a guy.
[281:35.46]The moon is the face.
[282:07.14]No!
[282:07.86]Wait, wait!
[282:09.64]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[282:13.18]It's not coming back.
[282:14.06]You don't get it again.
[282:15.04]It's not coming back now.
[282:16.90]You lost it forever.
[282:23.83]You fucking jokers.
[282:32.03]Why?
[282:33.93]No, it's not gonna come back.
[282:37.94]No way.
[282:39.90]You've had like 17 chances.
[282:46.87]But the green screen movie night was a lot of fun.
[282:48.51]I'm happy that you got to enjoy it.
[282:50.82]Uh, for stream?
[282:51.16]I don't know.
[282:51.46]I'm not sure if I'm even gonna stream Smash Bros.
[282:52.58]I've been fighting against it for like... I was gonna stream it today.
[283:18.75]But I feel like it's just one of those games that's hard to stream.
[283:29.31]Everyone is streaming Smash.
[283:30.69]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[283:37.07]Hard to stream?
[283:38.01]Well, let me put it this way.
[283:41.09]There are games that I like to play on stream because I think that a lot of people can enjoy them.
[283:46.25]There are games that I don't like to put on stream because I feel like I'm the only one that can enjoy them.
[283:50.75]Does that make sense?
[284:05.26]Sort of.
[284:07.58]Because like, oh, play through the world of light.
[284:09.80]Okay, I'm having a great time collecting stickers.
[284:15.79]And it can be interesting.
[284:16.49]Some of those encounters have been really, really interesting.
[284:18.79]And I'm not against streaming a game and playing a game just because.
[284:25.86]You know, I don't really have any rules for myself on this channel.
[284:29.24]It's just what do I feel like doing?
[284:30.70]Do I think I can have fun doing it?
[284:31.96]And do I feel like doing it?
[284:33.52]That's been the MO for this channel for like the last three years.
[284:36.83]I mean, for instance, I'm building a birdhouse probably in like the next couple days.
[284:40.65]I'm building a fucking birdhouse on stream.
[284:45.11]Like, why the fuck do I want to do that?
[284:47.99]One guy said, you should build stuff, build a birdhouse, build this.
[284:50.61]And I'm like, okay.
[284:51.89]Like, that sounds fucking cool.
[284:55.25]Am I gonna paint it?
[284:55.91]Oh, you better believe it.
[285:01.50]Why did I spoil that?
[285:02.38]No, that's alright.
[285:04.94]It's not a spoiler.
[285:06.34]You don't know what I'm gonna make.
[285:16.52]But that's... My mentality going into streams are always... What do I feel like doing and do I think it's gonna be fun?
[285:24.40]It's not, oh, I want to play this game, or I want to... Let me do this as like a series.
[285:28.40]No.
[285:29.94]Every single stream.
[285:31.56]Except obviously the ones that have to be planned months in advance.
[285:34.74]Or weeks in advance.
[285:39.49]But I don't really have a rhyme or reason to it besides the ones that have a lot of planning.
[285:45.33]The game and activity doesn't matter that much.
[285:47.13]If you're having fun, then the stream is fun.
[285:49.17]Yeah, that's true.
[285:50.33]That is the mentality.
[285:57.38]Who's the fabled one guy?
[286:00.48]Sferg, thanks for the three bucks.
[286:02.18]I haven't been a kid in 15 years and my childhood was just completed with the Balloons Tower defense game.
[286:07.57]I hope you stuck around for a chat and me.
[286:09.95]I was around.
[286:10.89]I did it, too.
[286:15.41]On hard.
[286:16.23]Oh, 85.
[286:19.82]Uh, Swiggity Swanky, thanks for the one dollar.
[286:21.22]One last question I've been meaning to ask.
[286:22.64]If you could take it all back, which meme would you remove from existence?
[286:26.00]The short joke?
[286:28.40]Or cosplaying as a rap short, short the short one, the short joke, the short joke, the short one, the one that we just said is short, the short joke, remove it a hundred times.
[286:38.73]I would rather be naked in that raptor costume than have somebody do the short joke again.
[286:57.16]That answers your question.
[287:03.42]Thank you, though.
[287:03.98]Thank you, the milkman, for the $1 money man.
[287:05.76]Thank you, milkman.
[287:06.42]Well, you're the money man and the milkman, it seems.
[287:09.69]It's time for slime.
[287:10.29]Thanks for the $2.
[287:10.93]Your biggest mistake is that you think chat knows what they want.
[287:15.93]Well, they did collectively beat Bloons Tower Defense, so... Thank you, mhharmless, for the $50.
[287:22.87]Now you have money for it.
[287:26.11]$50.
[287:26.65]Thank you.
[287:28.57]NFN, thanks for the three bucks.
[287:29.97]To think GeoGuessr is still to... still to there, to come.
[287:36.50]Oh, GeoGuessr is still to come.
[287:39.59]It is not, unfortunately.
[287:43.32]ExtraCheesy, thanks for the two bucks.
[287:44.42]Did you see that amazing YouTube rewind video?
[287:47.51]This year, it really shows how YouTube is trying to connect and be relatable with its content creators and viewers.
[287:52.31]I can't believe they got my favorite streamer, uh, Jeremy985, to say keep it down back there while on the battle bus.
[288:00.16]I'm truly blessed.
[288:07.90]Thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[288:08.88]Thank you, uh, thank you,
[288:13.30]Thank you, your boy, Gerald, for the $1.
[288:16.98]Thank you.
[288:17.66]Hey, Jerma, long time fan.
[288:18.62]It's been said before and I'll say it again.
[288:19.72]You're the best and most real streamer with the best community on the platform.
[288:23.08]Good enough to turn playing simple flash games into one of the most, the best and funniest streams I've seen all year.
[288:28.50]I almost died.
[288:29.78]Anyway, here's my contribution to the sock joke.
[288:31.52]Maybe you could give a pair to BFBugleberry or Santa if he hadn't mysteriously disappeared last year.
[288:36.50]That's alright.
[288:37.16]He'll be fine.
[288:38.66]He'll be, he's dead.
[288:40.56]But he might not be.
[288:44.00]Thank you.
[288:47.98]I'm glad you enjoy yourself here.
[288:54.89]Thanks a lot.
[288:58.63]Spoilers!
[289:03.25]Thank you Heathcliff the Friday Thriller for the $1.75 IQ chat.
[289:07.48]Thank you Spence for the $4.20.
[289:09.08]We need to play Sorcery with this extension.
[289:16.02]Oh, damn.
[289:16.80]That's... Damn, that's a great idea.
[289:18.92]That's a great... No, another choose-your-own-adventure book.
[289:22.82]That has endless possibility.
[289:25.52]We'll see.
[289:27.36]Super Spy Burger Flipper, thanks for the $1.
[289:29.10]You know, while you're sitting here letting 4,075 IQ chatters tell you what to do and buy Pikachu socks, remind yourself that you have enough IQ to become a doctor.
[289:40.19]I don't want to brag.
[289:41.75]I want to be humble about the whole thing.
[289:48.84]Thank you.
[289:49.28]Thank you Darkstar 700,000 games for the $1.
[289:51.29]In his ravenous hatred, he found no peace.
[289:55.03]And with boiling blood, he scoured the plains seeking vengeance against the Dark Lord who had wronged him.
[290:00.03]He wore the crown of the knight.
[290:01.99]What is this?
[290:06.10]This is the beginning of Doom.
[290:06.94]Is that the Doom beginning?
[290:09.86]Oh, okay.
[290:12.00]The Doom song that you were playing, okay.
[290:14.79]Hey, MeatyMatey, thanks for the one dollar.
[290:16.15]This is just like playing video games with your dad when you're four years old.
[290:23.29]Thank you, SuperSpyBurgerFlipper, for the one dollar.
[290:25.33]Even though I was joking around a bit before, I'm actually really invested in the Balloons Tower defense game.
[290:29.29]I'm proud of you, us, chat.
[290:32.95]Hey, I helped, I clicked on stuff.
[290:39.19]I was the middleman.
[290:42.29]Sometimes you need a middleman.
[290:45.28]It's time for slime.
[290:45.86]Thanks for the two bucks.
[290:46.48]Jeremy, you're awesome.
[290:47.10]This has been like you're the cool uncle and you're taking the time to play with your sister-in-law's weird, demanding kid.
[290:52.57]It's actually been a lot of fun so far.
[291:02.26]What a nice vessel.
[291:06.17]Erasmus.
[291:06.99]Thank you, Erasmus, for the $1.01.
[291:09.11]Going back to low budget Nick games, that reminds me, I think you might like Toon Twister 3D, but in all seriousness, thanks so much for all your streams.
[291:17.08]Man, they're one of a kind.
[291:17.94]Take care.
[291:19.88]Toon Twister?
[291:22.18]What the hell was that?
[291:26.43]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.00.

[291:54.23]Thank you.
[292:31.63]I had to go check on something.
[292:32.86]I had to go check on something real quick.
[292:38.98]I had to talk to Kim for a second.
[292:43.44]I wanted to ask her a question.
[292:45.82]Okay.
[292:51.01]Mob.
[292:51.57]Mob?

[292:56.91]Erasmus, thank you for the $1.00.
[293:00.93]Appreciate that.
[293:01.41]Dr. Clay, thanks for the $1.
[293:02.47]That moment with you arguing with the robot was golden.
[293:04.81]I really want to animate it now.
[293:05.93]Take care.
[293:08.77]Well, good luck with whatever you come up with.
[293:15.04]I should have played this music says extra cheesy for a dollar here.
[293:17.96]This is crabs walking for 10 hours.
[293:25.35]That would just get lost in the balloons popping.
[293:26.97]That's just the balloons popping sound.
[293:31.47]Thank you, ExtraCheesy.
[293:32.19]Thank you, HoneyChain, for the two bucks.

[294:08.37]We all did this together.
[294:09.21]We did do this together.
[294:10.63]I was a part of it.
[294:11.43]Don't tell me I wasn't a part of it.
[294:12.61]I was there.
[294:15.56]Awesome, Alec.
[294:16.04]Thanks for the $1.

[294:32.33]Seriously, though, thanks for being the best streamer on Twitch.
[294:35.65]Um, if you say so.
[294:36.93]I'm glad you think that.
[294:38.03]Thank you for everything.
[294:39.05]Thank you.
[294:41.39]Thanks for the five dollars.

[294:48.24]Thank you so much, Pinman.
[294:49.66]Tons of gifted subs.
[294:52.63]And we're getting near the end here.
[294:53.54]Thank you, Gonderlane, for the $1.
[294:54.98]As one of the two guys who asked you to play Flash games, uh, shout out to Awesome Triss.
[295:00.74]I'm glad we made one of the best streams possible, even if this went way out of control.
[295:07.34]I told you I would prove- I- I prove it!
[295:09.02]I'm gonna prove it to you on more than one occasion, that if you- sometimes you're gonna be the one person that says something.
[295:15.15]The one guy.
[295:15.77]You're gonna be the one guy.
[295:17.21]There are four or five thousand people here tonight.
[295:19.53]You- I promise, eventually, at some point, you'll be the one guy.
[295:24.26]Or girl.
[295:25.00]Don't matter.
[295:25.28]You know what I'm saying?
[295:29.25]Like, you'll be the one person.
[295:31.03]It'll happen.
[295:36.32]If you hang out here long enough,
[295:41.78]Kyralo, thanks for the $1.
[295:43.10]I clicked the wrong spot on the screen and now do not have 140 bits.
[295:47.64]I blame the Pokémon socks.
[295:51.38]Thank you Timmy Tim Tim for the $1.
[295:53.04]Great stream.
[295:53.54]Thanks for doing my favorite bit again.
[295:59.32]Thank you.
[295:59.98]I'm going to talk over this.
[296:00.92]What kind of work do you do?
[296:06.93]Thank you, TimmyTimTim for the $1.
[296:08.97]CluelessSnarper, thanks for the $1.
[296:12.51]Thank you.
[296:15.31]TheSpaz, thanks for the $10.
[296:18.56]First time donating to a streamer.
[296:20.20]Been watching for a while.
[296:21.14]Hope you're doing great.
[296:21.86]Thank you.
[296:23.90]Thanks for the $10.
[296:24.42]First time donating.
[296:31.94]Been watching for a while.
[296:32.78]I'm glad you've been here for this long.
[296:34.96]Don't worry about paying me money.
[296:36.64]Thank you for giving it to me in the first place, though.
[296:41.35]Thank you.
[296:45.71]When I was a kid, people would always ask, who is your idol?
[296:48.75]I never really cared, so I would say something generic like Abraham Lincoln or John Glenn.
[296:53.74]But now that I've gotten older, I realize that I do actually have an idol.
[296:56.30]Someone I look up to.
[296:57.98]Someone I aspire to be.
[296:59.08]Have you figured that out yet?
[297:01.69]It's you.
[297:05.68]If I can have that kind of an impact on you, man.
[297:13.38]That's... I'm more important as an idol than Abraham Lincoln?
[297:21.57]If I have that kind of impact on you, that makes me really happy.
[297:30.68]That's a coffee pasta.
[297:31.78]No, it's not.
[297:32.34]Don't tell me that.
[297:35.85]It's not.
[297:38.99]Abraham Lincoln didn't beat Bloons.
[297:42.57]And neither did I. But that means a lot.
[297:46.83]Thank you.
[297:52.05]The vessel's gonna cry.
[297:53.15]No.
[298:00.52]The only goal I've ever had, and I mean this for real, was just to have fun.
[298:09.44]If you don't like, if you don't, if you don't think it's funny, if you don't think it's fun, that's fine, that's okay.
[298:15.23]If you do, cool.
[298:18.31]I'm just gonna keep doing it, you know?
[298:23.35]There's a lot of new subs just came in.
[298:24.79]KyroToby just gave another 10.
[298:26.73]Thank you, KyroToby.
[298:34.41]I get a lot of, uh, you know, really, really, really nice messages.
[298:42.27]And that's why, that's why sometimes you guys are wondering, like, oh, why is he, like, why are you being so hard on yourself?
[298:46.62]Come on, man.
[298:49.58]I don't know, because I, I just, I don't, it's not, I don't think it's anything to do with being hard.
[298:56.09]I mean, I fuck around a lot and we talk a lot of, uh, just shit.
[298:59.47]We have, by the way, Gino, somebody, Gino got one of those gifted subs.
[299:04.53]Nice.
[299:14.76]But I don't, I don't, look, if people, if somebody doesn't like what I'm doing and they're like, oh, you should do this sucks.
[299:19.96]You suck.
[299:21.74]You know, it's like, alright, man, whatever.
[299:24.72]I,
[299:27.19]I always, anytime I see something, like, negative, and I don't, this doesn't happen that often, but I always feel like there's so much wonderful things people say.
[299:35.84]I never want to put myself on, like, a pedestal, you know what I mean?
[299:39.02]And feel like, oh, like, I read all these wonderful things about me.
[299:41.89]People say such nice fucking things every day.
[299:44.33]Every single time I stream.
[299:47.97]And, of course, people can fuck around and chat and, you know, put dicks on the screen and... Oh, like, short and stupid and bad, but that's... For the most part, we're just having a good time.
[300:02.98]Short, stupid, bad.
[300:05.50]Well, I need to, like, re-evaluate here.
[300:10.51]To be fair, a pedestal might really help you out, height-wise, yeah.
[300:16.49]But I don't want anyone to, like, hate me.
[300:18.80]You know?
[300:23.80]I feel, like, bad when people are, like, actually angry or, like, upset with something that I do.
[300:28.00]I'm just like, fuck, man.
[300:29.10]Like, I don't want you to feel like that.
[300:35.41]But I don't ever want all the wonderful, nice things people say kind of invade my head.
[300:42.84]And, oh, look at me!
[300:43.89]Look at me!
[300:44.33]I'm the greatest!
[300:45.21]Oh, I'm so good at everything!
[300:46.87]Like, I don't... You know what I'm saying?
[300:49.53]I try to keep myself as grounded as I can.
[300:53.71]I did do the look at me.
[300:54.61]I did do it.
[301:04.85]Tremor, you're grounded.
[301:08.86]Oh, fuck this guy.
[301:09.60]He ruined TF2 with that shpee shit.
[301:16.96]And I don't want people to... Maybe I'm just trying to please everybody, but I don't know.
[301:26.14]But I don't think I am either.
[301:27.15]I'd say like a bunch of fucking... I'd say a lot of shit that could come across as mean.
[301:35.63]Can we draw one more penis?
[301:37.13]Okay.
[301:57.59]Nice, okay, good.
[302:00.88]One more for the road.
[302:15.79]No, but it's something I think about a lot.
[302:17.11]And then this whole kind of tangent started by somebody talking about... It was... It was Drosophilia.
[302:29.65]You look up to me and somebody that you aspire to be.
[302:34.67]I always want to try to challenge what I'm doing.
[302:40.55]And if that inspires you, then fuck yeah, I'm happy.
[302:44.39]More than happy.
[302:51.95]Thank you so much for that message, and thank you everybody for being here.
[302:58.49]The yellowist again, thanks for $1.
[302:59.95]I only get $4 before that number bothers me.
[303:02.45]Here, have another dollar.
[303:03.35]Thanks for the $5.
[303:03.77]When are the Pikachu socks going to be delivered?
[303:08.75]Probably like next week or something.
[303:11.22]They'll just show up on stream, don't worry.
[303:16.24]Bet3, thanks for the $5.
[303:17.22]Can't wait for you to play Katamari.
[303:18.46]Neither can I, it's going to be great.
[303:20.54]That'll probably be happening very soon.
[303:23.18]Maybe sooner than you think.
[303:25.39]Timmy Timtan, thanks for the $1.
[303:26.75]One guy for the next Jerma Rumble.
[303:28.11]That's not a bad idea.
[303:29.91]I was thinking about putting the one guy in quotes in the Rumble this year, but kind of ran out of time.
[303:38.47]Flying Sombrero, thanks for the $1.
[303:39.72]The funny thing about the short joke is me and a lot of people here in chat are your height or shorter.
[303:44.10]Too bad you will forever be a short man.
[303:46.92]P.S.
[303:47.20]Good job, chat.
[303:47.90]We won the monkey war.
[303:56.46]Thanks.
[303:57.70]Thank you, ConvoBreaker, for the $1.
[303:59.10]Hey, Jerma, speaking of choose-your-own-adventure games, Pyre is won by the guys who made Bastion and Transistor.

[304:09.17]I'm gonna do that, too.
[304:11.29]Thank you, ManBearPig, for the $10.
[304:12.70]Appreciate it.

[304:27.36]Love you, Jerma.
[304:28.00]Interested in hearing your favorite Gorillaz song.

[304:33.35]Stylo is my favorite Gorillaz song.
[304:36.87]Erebus the Great, thanks for the $1.
[304:38.21]I've been going through a rough patch in my life.

[305:34.74]Thanks a lot, dude.
[305:35.28]That's a lot.
[305:36.40]Huge subs.
[305:38.48]You're awesome.
[305:41.58]Every day, this channel grows more and more and more in subs.
[305:44.25]More and more and more in bits.
[305:50.81]It can be fairly overwhelming sometimes.
[305:53.94]But just know that whatever you give to this channel, a huge amount of it is going right back in.
[306:01.79]So, thank you.
[306:12.00]You guys take really, really good fucking care of me.
[306:16.25]Let that be known.
[306:19.33]The Spaz, thanks for the $4.
[306:20.75]Again, one of the few streamers I actually check out, even if it means I won't get sleep.
[306:24.39]From Sweden.
[306:26.26]You're up real late.
[306:28.46]Very late.
[306:30.28]Well, have a good morning.
[306:32.10]Right?
[306:32.46]Good... Good afternoon?
[306:34.40]Good morning?
[306:40.05]Thank you so much.

[306:44.44]It's 9 in the morning here, holy shit.
[306:47.32]Good afternoon, good morning, good evening, good night, wherever you are.
[306:51.18]Topac, thanks for the $1.
[306:53.03]It is a clip.
[306:54.35]I don't know how those stay.
[306:57.79]That's like the gnome of my own channel.
[307:01.75]Uh, Chubby Funster, thanks for the $1.
[307:03.15]Jeremiah, you didn't look at the link.
[307:06.45]Bet3 put in their message.
[307:09.71]You sure?
[307:16.12]I didn't look at the link.
[307:23.69]It's a gnome.
[307:26.97]But while I go looking for this, here is... the... here are the credits.
[307:36.19]We have an uncountable amount of subs on the channel at the moment.
[307:40.34]And here are just a small sample.
[307:44.91]of that shitload of people.
[307:47.64]Oh, there it is.
[307:51.18]All the subs and resubs tonight, thank you so much, guys.
[307:58.34]I must snap 50% of them.
[308:04.35]Where is this?
[308:06.05]I clicked on only a few links.
[308:09.05]Did I not click on one of them?
[308:09.93]Are you sure?
[308:13.82]Let me go make sure... It grows every day.
[308:28.09]It's fucking remarkable.
[308:29.15]Uh, I see bet three from earlier.
[308:38.75]Can't wait for you to play Katamari.
[308:42.02]But Bet gave a few more times, I think.
[308:44.12]Let me see.
[308:44.76]I don't see a link.
[308:51.09]Does anybody have the link that he had on his message?
[309:07.10]Because I don't see one.
[309:12.88]Oh, here it is.
[309:14.66]Oh, it's Katamari like balls.
[309:16.36]What the fuck is this?
[309:19.76]Is that really what that was?
[309:21.23]Is that really what that was?
[309:22.55]That's what I clicked on and that's what I'm doing?
[309:28.75]Thank you, guys.
[309:33.70]It was worth the time.
[309:35.02]Thank you.
[309:35.53]Thank you, Erebus the Great, for $4 right here at the end.
[309:37.99]Might as well give you the rest of the bits.
[309:39.73]Keep on being amazing.
[309:40.61]Love you, Jerma.
[309:41.09]Thank you, Erebus, for the $4.
[309:43.87]And the rest of the bits.
[309:46.49]Thank you.
[309:47.25]Kyra, Toby, thanks for the $1.
[309:48.33]I'm just wondering how many subs you have now.
[309:49.77]If you're not comfortable giving a number, that's cool.
[309:53.15]No, I've told you guys before that there's a fucking insane amount of people here now.
[309:59.11]It's not a secret.
[310:03.55]Over the last... I'll give you some real numbers here that's just fucking insane.
[310:08.57]Over the last... six months, this channel has, in six months, not even six, four, not even six months, like five months, received over 3,000 subs in the last not even half a year.
[310:26.15]And that was on top of what I had before.
[310:29.53]It's fucking insane.
[310:32.76]And especially, you know, that means we're over 5k.
[310:40.34]There are more than 5,000 fucking subs on this channel.
[310:53.97]And a bunch of these happened in the last like 45 days.
[311:00.73]It jumped up like fucking crazy.
[311:04.01]I think, since moving to Vegas, there, I think, has been more than 2,500 to 3,000 subs, maybe, even just since moving.
[311:18.55]It's been an insane amount.
[311:25.18]I did 100 of them last stream.
[311:26.58]Yeah, I'm not even counting those.
[311:29.10]So you guys see how...
[311:33.42]You know, it affects me.
[311:34.40]It does.
[311:34.94]I want this channel to be fun.
[311:37.24]I want you to care.
[311:38.14]I want you to think it's worth paying for.
[311:39.38]And if there are over 5,000 fucking people paying this stream, every month, I want this shit... I want you to be fucking happy being here.
[311:48.15]I want you to have fucking fun.
[311:50.57]And if I get that kind of fucking money, I'm gonna fucking do that shit.
[311:55.09]I'm gonna try as hard as I can.
[312:03.98]He's gonna cry.
[312:04.94]No, I'm not gonna cry.
[312:13.49]But this channel, even in viewers, not just subscriptions or bits or... Just take a look at the view numbers that have happened over the last, like, two or three months.
[312:23.73]The channel has almost doubled in size in three months.
[312:29.59]Almost, sometimes potentially tripled in size.
[312:43.00]So, but that, I don't want that to change the way that I do things.
[312:49.24]I don't want... Oh yeah, you got 12,000 concurrent viewers a few days ago, whatever it was.
[312:56.27]Like the last week.
[312:58.11]Oh yeah, you know, you got 5,000 fucking subs on your channel.
[313:01.76]I don't want to change the shit that I, like how I approach things.
[313:11.06]If there were 11,000 people here versus 500, I'm gonna approach the streams the same exact way.
[313:19.80]And now if there's more people and there's more money coming in, I'm just gonna do other shit.
[313:26.35]I'm gonna try to do more stuff.
[313:35.57]Remember the Hitman 1 message you recorded for us?
[313:39.00]Yeah.
[313:42.45]Yes, I do.
[313:43.27]I remember that night very, very vividly.
[313:47.91]Hundreds and hundreds of dollars came in that night, and that was one of the first times I'd ever had like six, seven, eight thousand, fifteen hundred dollars given in one stream.
[314:08.10]But
[314:10.31]That's gonna be the end of tonight.
[314:13.33]I'm probably... I don't know.
[314:14.59]I think at this point, because it's getting very late, I might take tomorrow off and come back on Monday with Katamari.
[314:22.44]EDF?
[314:23.24]Yeah, I wasn't sure if I was... Because I'm probably not gonna get to sleep until probably 3 a.m.
[314:26.82]now.
[314:28.52]And I wasn't sure if I was gonna do it two days in a row.
[314:31.02]So we'll come back Monday with Katamari.
[314:34.24]EDF comes out.
[314:35.22]Probably gonna play that with a few friends.
[314:42.56]Thanks a lot for hanging out.
[314:44.38]Thanks for playing bloons on my stream for three and a half hours, guys.
[314:51.06]Much love to you.
[314:51.66]Take care of yourselves.
[314:53.36]Very, very quickly at the end here, we had a few more bits that come in.
[315:00.51]That is the spaz with 100.
[315:02.27]Just want to show this vid real quick before I went off.
[315:05.34]Have a good night.
[315:06.28]Wanted to show this vid.
[315:08.26]I don't have a link.
[315:11.05]Oh, they corrected themselves.
[315:12.67]Here it is.
[315:13.21]Here's the video I meant.
[315:14.19]Here's my video.
[315:18.81]What the hell is this?
[315:31.88]What is this?
[315:33.34]What is this video?
[315:38.59]That's not the gnome, right?
[315:41.00]The gnome was like, oh!
[315:42.90]That was, ah!
[315:46.42]Let me make sure I get this right.
[315:47.38]The gnome goes, oh!
[315:49.17]Oh!
[315:49.55]No.
[315:50.69]Oh!
[315:52.37]Oh!
[315:54.33]That was, ah!
[315:54.81]Oh!
[316:00.51]Alright.
[316:00.85]Thank you for the video.
[316:01.59]It was bad.
[316:02.90]I appreciate it.
[316:05.08]Thank you, DinkyDuper, for the $1.
[316:06.74]Hey, Jerma, we've had trouble setting aside time to watch the stream lately.
[316:09.10]I usually end up just being a smelly VOD man.
[316:12.36]Take care.
[316:13.02]It's alright.
[316:13.62]Whatever.
[316:13.84]You don't have to watch every stream live.
[316:16.63]It's alright, man.
[316:17.93]Don't worry about it.
[316:19.97]KyroToby, thanks for the $1.
[316:20.97]Greedy streamer won't cry until 10,000 sub, LOL.
[316:24.97]Not true.
[316:26.19]Thank you.
[316:26.65]ParadoxPotato, thanks for the bits.
[316:29.51]When are we gonna get Jerma Neptune, jermaEgg?
[316:33.28]There'll be another wave of sub, of emotes.
[316:37.08]We just added so many of them.
[316:38.28]I just needed a little bit to have some more references and maybe replace a couple of ones that I put on already.
[316:45.27]Hey, Zshpi, thanks for the $1 Jerma.
[316:47.17]I've been following you since your old TF2 commentary.
[316:49.73]You've been doing this, you've been doing you this whole time.
[316:51.69]It just depends on the medium you're given to express yourself.
[316:55.33]You're amazing.
[316:58.57]Thank you.
[317:01.19]And, uh, the search for Corbin, thank you for the sub that just came right in.
[317:07.86]Uh... Let's just keep having fun.
[317:13.08]I'm not gonna let sub numbers or view numbers change anything, so... Let's just keep doing what we're doing.
[317:23.43]Have a great rest of your evening, guys.
[317:24.93]Have a wonderful remaining day or morning, wherever you're awake.
[317:29.51]If it's the morning.
[317:32.66]And you get to do it one more time.
[317:35.74]I'll see you guys on Monday.
[317:36.76]Monday at around probably 3 p.m.
[317:38.08]Pacific.
[317:41.92]Don't let me down here.
[317:44.38]Don't let me down here.
[317:53.54]Don't let me down!
[317:57.48]Okay, so it's just a guy.
[317:59.32]It's just like a guy.
[318:00.47]It's the moon.
[318:01.11]It's just a guy.
[318:04.50]Don't do it.
[318:08.26]You actually aren't doing it.
[318:10.18]And you're wearing a hat?
[318:11.20]Okay.
[318:12.84]Very nice.
[318:15.30]Very nice, guys.
[318:18.06]It's peanut butter jelly time.
[318:21.52]It's peanut butter jelly time.
[318:30.52]Alright, I'll see you later.
[318:34.44]See you on Monday.
[318:35.18]Take care, guys.
[318:36.74]Goodbye.
