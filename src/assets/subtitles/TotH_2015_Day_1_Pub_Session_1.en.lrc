[ve:61.1.100]

[00:49.73]Seagull, Banny and Truck Truck and I believe we're going to be joined by Star and Jerma in this pubbing session.
[00:58.32]We do have a little bit of an incentive that we're trying to get going here admirable if you can tell us a little bit about that.
[01:04.28]Yeah so coming up in about 90 minutes I think or I suppose by the time that segment that we're going to be talking about is over it could be like close to two hours
[01:13.13]But it's going to be during the ulti duo tournament.
[01:16.54]The incentive is if we can raise $5,000 between now and then, they will rematch the finals on this kind of jokey map.
[01:25.22]It's going to be Granary mid.
[01:26.62]The MG tournament?
[01:28.18]The MG tournament, correct.
[01:29.30]MG tournament.
[01:29.79]Yes, you said ulti duo.
[01:30.99]Did I?
[01:31.61]Yeah.
[01:32.07]Oh my god, MGE Tournament.
[01:36.26]Tag me out.
[01:37.14]So for the MGE Tournament, we're a $5,000 incentive, donation incentive, to have the top players, the grand final players, rematch on TF2 on Granary, except the floor is lava.
[01:52.00]Literally lava.
[01:52.90]So if you get knocked off the crates on Granary, you fall to the ground, it's lava.
[01:57.56]You die.
[01:58.73]It's like that game everyone played when they were a child, jumping from couch to couch pretending you couldn't touch the ground because it was lava.
[02:04.85]But this time it's serious.
[02:05.97]This time it's MGE.
[02:07.60]Right, and that'll be the finalists.
[02:08.72]It'll be the best of the MGE players that we have to offer.
[02:11.68]Yeah, I don't know if we can actually touch the ground.
[02:14.18]I'm just going to engage the core.
[02:17.85]Right.
[02:18.51]So you guys can be a part of that when you donate.
[02:22.51]You can donate any amount.
[02:24.56]And when you decide where you want to allot your money, you can also scroll down to the next option, and you will find the incentive there.
[02:33.31]And like we said, if we raise $5,000 toward that, so just go ahead.
[02:37.55]You can still enter yourself into any raffle that you want and then choose.
[02:42.30]the lava incentive, your funds will go towards that.
[02:47.17]And if we raise $5,000 by the end of that MGE, the MGE finalist will be replaying on the lava map.
[02:54.80]And I'm actually kind of excited to see what that looks like.
[02:57.92]We've kind of gone out on a limb here as well because we were talking to production during the intermission there and it seemed like that incentive had been cut.
[03:05.55]And they were like, well, do you want to do it anyway?
[03:07.61]So, you know, we're competitors.
[03:09.11]We want to see if we can raise that $5,000.
[03:11.38]Yeah, there was a little issue where it just was forgotten to be put up on the tracker, but we fixed that, and so now it's up.
[03:20.82]I'm sure we have a perfect amount of time in order to get the 5,000 for the, I was going to say initiative, to have our gamers fight on the lava floor.
[03:31.66]Well, it's a challenge.
[03:32.88]It's a challenge for us to see if we can get that in the next about hour and a half to two hours.
[03:37.71]But, you know, we're putting that challenge out to you guys, and if you can meet that, we'll have some excellent TF2, some hilarity to ensue.
[03:45.21]We can see on screen we have Mobla himself going ham with the sniper rifle.
[03:50.50]With the double.
[03:51.22]Oh, my goodness.
[03:52.08]That was too much pressure.
[03:53.32]Yeah, after that, just nothing, honestly.
[03:59.71]Hey, calm down.
[04:01.65]What?
[04:02.87]The hilarity from the truck truck over there in the back right corner of the gaming table.
[04:07.79]Wait, truck truck's here?
[04:08.81]Yeah.
[04:09.21]Hey.
[04:09.76]Hey, what's up, dude?
[04:12.08]What's going on?
[04:13.12]Nothing.
[04:14.48]Just hanging out.
[04:15.58]Is that Star?
[04:16.60]I think that's Jerma.
[04:17.42]Is that Tag?
[04:19.00]Hey, Star.
[04:20.17]Wow, we're all here.
[04:21.45]Wow, these are all my good buddies.
[04:24.09]Yeah.
[04:24.21]You guys want to play MVM later?
[04:26.29]Yeah.
[04:27.11]I want to play MVM later.
[04:28.53]Yeah.
[04:29.88]Are you a part of the MVM later?
[04:31.76]Of course.
[04:31.98]That is, in fact, later?
[04:33.09]I am, in fact, a part of the MVM.
[04:35.27]Do you know who's not getting a pan?
[04:36.69]You know who I suggested would have to sign the pans before they were given away?
[04:40.60]Just so you'd have to give them away?
[04:42.08]I know it was you.
[04:43.20]You're the one who came.
[04:44.37]You told me that whoever won the pan, if they wanted it signed, you'd give it to me so that I could sign it, and then I'd have to give it back.
[04:52.34]So I'll never have an actual pan to use of my own.
[04:55.78]It'll just flow through your hands.
[04:57.81]Yeah, it'll just... Water.
[05:00.21]That would be a real moral dilemma.
[05:01.51]Would you, you know, potentially run with the pan?
[05:05.57]Yeah, actually, JK, you know, my 6,000 hours in TF2 has been just so that I can take a golden pan from the kids.
[05:14.88]Of course, we have three of them in our backpack, two of them.
[05:19.95]PROVIDED BY SHADOW STEEL THERE.
[05:22.43]DO YOU LIKE THAT MOVE?
[05:23.81]WHEN YOU GUYS DONATE, YOU CAN CHOOSE TO BE ENTERED INTO THE GOLDEN PAN RAFFLE, AND THERE WILL BE THREE OF THEM, AND THAT IS A HOT COMMODITY ITEM THAT WE HAVE ONCE YOU GUYS DONATE.
[05:33.14]YOU MIGHT SAY IT'S SIZZLING.
[05:36.91]YOU MIGHT SAY THAT.
[05:38.63]I COULD NOT COMMIT TO THAT.
[05:39.79]I KNEW I WAS COMMITTING A SIN, AND I LAUGHED.
[05:45.32]THOSE GOLDEN PANS ARE SO COOL.
[05:48.13]Yeah.
[05:49.29]Not cool enough to be able to inspect, though.
[05:52.09]Not cool to what?
[05:53.01]Not cool enough to be able to inspect, though.
[05:54.78]You only can inspect cool items.
[05:56.30]Yeah.
[05:58.24]Oh, that means it's underground, and you can't... That's good.
[06:01.89]Hey, Curtis.
[06:02.57]How's it going?
[06:03.29]Did you get any... Oh, there it is.
[06:05.23]Oh, my God.
[06:07.37]Who is that?
[06:07.89]Professor... Blap?
[06:11.42]Oh, there's another.
[06:12.18]Oh, he's too smart.
[06:13.54]How are you still alive?
[06:15.74]I hit you, like, 17 times with that wrench.
[06:17.93]Jorma, how does it feel to be the worst person in the server?
[06:20.32]Oh, he almost made it.
[06:23.76]He almost made it.
[06:26.01]Look at the scoreboard!
[06:28.45]You were here before everyone!
[06:30.62]Oh, I got one more point than you.
[06:33.25]Is that one more kill?
[06:34.89]Check the KDR.
[06:36.38]That's what matters.
[06:36.98]How many of those are teleports?
[06:39.20]No, they're not.
[06:39.88]I didn't even put it down because I'm terrible.
[06:42.22]You just went through your own teleporter?
[06:44.65]Yeah, but that was the one time it was actually there.
[06:47.81]I'm trying to do a new thing.
[06:48.71]I'm trying to get this new loadout going.
[06:50.20]I'm trying to make a trend here.
[06:51.48]a trend of that's a new engineer on no it's it's a loadout it's called the thought provoker okay can you talk to me about it no it's pretty it's pretty simple you get first you gotta go engineer that's very important okay and you put you put on the Eureka Effect okay
[07:08.02]And you put exit down, so nobody knows where it is.
[07:12.19]And then you thought-provoke to it, and you get kills.
[07:15.41]Okay.
[07:16.64]I already did it.
[07:17.56]I already gave somebody the provoke.
[07:18.76]You just got to really make sure to watch out for that taunt-killing pyro right out the exit, and then you get the kills.
[07:24.27]Yeah.
[07:25.21]It's all about the exit.
[07:26.99]It's all about the exit.
[07:28.27]I see where you're coming from.
[07:29.82]So now, instead of having to make an entrance and an exit, you can just make an exit just for yourself so no one finds it, so you can be extra sneaky.
[07:39.28]I see the potential.
[07:51.39]Maybe this can be the new Highlander strat.
[07:53.71]Sneaky engineers.
[07:55.42]Speaking of Highlander, as you know, we are running those timed raffles throughout the event, and we have a winner from the NAHL time raffle, and that is EpicBatCow.
[08:09.67]So he is the winner of the over $200 in TF2 items.
[08:14.41]So congrats to you, EpicBatCow.
[08:17.42]You will be taking home some Australian weapons, the gold ones, like that pan that you want, including other items.
[08:23.44]So good luck to you.
[08:25.40]Oh, don't say that, man.
[08:26.67]We had a backlash after the promotional video in which we said the pan was Australian.
[08:32.26]Apparently it's golden.
[08:33.12]There's a difference.
[08:35.06]If you check the name in the backpack, it clearly says Australian pan, which we may or may not have renamed it.
[08:41.39]I think you need to check the lore.
[08:43.66]I think you need to check the lore.
[08:46.43]What is the lore?
[08:47.33]Can you enlighten us?
[08:50.72]We're all frauds.
[08:51.54]We got caught.
[08:52.56]We don't know the lore.
[08:53.67]I just collect the comics.
[08:54.67]I don't read them.
[08:56.49]They're still in the plastic.
[09:00.76]Mint condition.
[09:02.29]Vacuum sealed.
[09:05.47]I'm working on this new loadout.
[09:07.05]I'm just trying to get this new loadout going.
[09:09.77]It's called the Greasy Barbecue.
[09:12.04]It's a thirsty bully pyro.
[09:13.80]And you have to have the ham on, too.
[09:15.14]It's very important.
[09:16.08]I'm going to make this one.
[09:17.00]It's going to be trending.
[09:18.39]You've got to have the score shot on, too.
[09:20.13]And then you get behind everybody and teleport behind everybody with your exits.
[09:23.98]I think you're telling everybody what you're going to do.
[09:25.92]Are you playing Pyro or are you playing Enji?
[09:28.98]Yeah, I'm confused.
[09:31.09]There was a teleporting involved, but then there was also Pyro weapons involved.
[09:35.63]You combine the two classes into this.
[09:37.67]One of them's the grease, one's the barbecue.
[09:41.10]Can I get a buff over here?
[09:43.38]Please.
[09:44.42]Someone's trying to play a pub.
[09:46.55]Everyone just wants to heal Jerma.
[09:48.61]Again, everyone is actually just healing Jerma.
[09:51.97]Keep the heals on me.
[09:52.63]Why does everyone love you?
[09:53.47]We got any diddly donations in?
[09:55.10]We do.
[09:55.54]I'd like to read a donation from Lick Lake.
[10:00.28]It's a $20 donation.
[10:01.32]He says, awesome event.
[10:03.40]Keep going, smiley face.
[10:05.00]Thank you, Lick Lake, for the donation.
[10:09.91]Thank you for including your name, too.
[10:11.81]I'm 22 years old, and I'm cracking up at that name.
[10:15.17]I'm an adult.
[10:16.28]What was the name?
[10:17.52]Lick Lake.
[10:18.40]Lick Lake.
[10:18.88]Yeah.
[10:19.76]I don't know why.
[10:21.36]The second he said Lick, I'm like, that's funny.
[10:23.46]LMAO.
[10:26.99]LMAO.
[10:30.77]Can we get the greasy barbecue cam, please?
[10:33.24]You want to see this in action?
[10:34.78]Yeah.
[10:35.38]You want to see it in action?
[10:36.08]There's a whole lot of people.
[10:37.20]Let's go.
[10:37.78]Can we get the camera on this greasy barbecue action, please?
[10:41.49]He's waltzing.
[10:43.75]I see somebody greased me from behind.
[10:46.71]I saw your hand.
[10:47.83]What does that feel like?
[10:48.65]Oh, wow.
[10:49.45]Wow, sure.
[10:51.94]He's got the Degreaser on.
[10:54.08]I have the back burner on.
[10:57.20]Just violently switching through POVs trying to find this greasy clay.
[11:02.93]Alright.
[11:03.77]There's Jerma.
[11:04.40]Okay.
[11:04.70]There we go.
[11:05.82]Okay.
[11:06.36]Alright.
[11:06.58]You got to cook the meat.
[11:07.40]You got to get the flame.
[11:11.65]I can't do anything.
[11:13.92]There's a center over there, so I can't do anything.
[11:16.12]Well, what about the teleport part?
[11:17.25]You didn't teleport.
[11:18.90]that somebody else has to be playing engineer.
[11:20.76]I need synergy.
[11:22.44]Dude, Seagull is going ham.
[11:24.54]You want to talk about that play, Seagull?
[11:25.94]Look at this combo.
[11:27.73]I sat there and spammed rockets.
[11:29.41]Nice.
[11:30.33]I got him.
[11:31.17]Got him.
[11:32.45]Got him.
[11:34.19]Seagull, did you think this through?
[11:35.81]I know, that ham pyro was trying to grease me.
[11:38.20]Seagull, did you equip the airstrike and the parachute because you're flying?
[11:42.42]Never mind.
[11:43.50]You're dead.
[11:44.96]Oh, my lord.
[11:48.33]I'd like to remind everybody that when you donate... I was waving.
[11:52.71]I wasn't... 100% of all donations will be going to One Step Camp, which allows kids to go to camp, build memories, build hope, build friendships for the future.
[12:02.10]It lets them be a kid.
[12:03.58]You can see right now we're having lots of fun in the pub.
[12:06.70]Everyone just having a lot of fun.
[12:10.28]A blast.
[12:10.66]Yeah, enjoying the games.
[12:11.97]And we believe, and One Step Camp believes, that everybody should have that right, and especially when kids are going through a tough time...
[12:17.89]of dealing with cancer, One Step Camp gives them that hope and lets them have a little bit of fun and levity in their lives.
[12:27.53]And 100% of all donations will be going to One Step Camp.
[12:32.01]Of course, when you donate, you can also allot which
[12:35.88]raffles you want your funds to go to and we have plenty of awesome items there's in-game items there's going to be um uncrating I believe tomorrow there's there's two fortress two and there's Counter-Strike uh uncrating um and you can just go to the tracker where you want your funds to go to and there's lots of great prizes there for you
[12:56.69]We got a quilt up top behind us on the wall.
[12:59.75]The Twitch troop.
[13:00.42]There it is.
[13:01.02]The Valve merch.
[13:01.92]Balloonicorn's just been sitting there behind you the whole time, man.
[13:04.10]Yeah.
[13:04.89]You haven't even introduced him or her.
[13:06.91]I feel like it's looking over me, so I'm trying not to acknowledge it.
[13:10.79]It's like a stray dog.
[13:12.14]You don't want to look at it because it follows you.
[13:13.54]Right.
[13:13.84]I'm a little intimidated right now.
[13:15.36]It took me 30 minutes to blow that up.
[13:17.74]Really?
[13:18.28]Yes.
[13:18.79]It took even longer to hang it up.
[13:21.47]Yeah, I was watching you guys.
[13:23.91]So let me try my hand at this.
[13:25.48]Let me know if I'm doing it right.
[13:26.46]We had a $10 donation from Cosmic Cowboy.
[13:29.60]There is no comment, but I really like that name.
[13:32.23]That is a good name.
[13:32.77]Cosmic Cowboy.
[13:34.07]Nice alliteration.
[13:34.97]Kneeled at me in that name.
[13:36.21]Thank you.
[13:36.61]Thank you.
[13:37.47]I'll be here all week.
[13:41.22]What do you think a cosmic cowboy does?
[13:43.68]There's sentries, dude!
[13:46.35]He would, uh, like, you know, because, like, cowboys, don't they, like, aren't they, like, herders and stuff?
[13:54.28]So, like, is it a space cow that they chase after?
[13:57.65]Probably stars.
[13:58.69]Stars, okay.
[13:59.88]And...
[14:03.09]I got it.
[14:04.71]We have a $250 donation from TF2 Center.
[14:09.52]And it says, more to come soon, smiley face.
[14:12.61]And then, P.S., you guys are doing an awesome job so far.
[14:16.74]Thank you very much.
[14:17.40]Thank you for that donation.
[14:19.64]Like we said, all of the proceeds do go to One Step Camp and to help children.
[14:23.69]So if anyone doesn't know, TF2 Center is a website you can go to to play 6v6 or Highlander or 4v4 matches.
[14:32.86]It's a lobby-based system.
[14:34.26]All you do is log in, click on a map that you want to play,
[14:37.95]And then you're in, and you play.
[14:41.88]Kurt's giving me some perfect eye contact right now.
[14:46.35]It's over.
[14:46.87]Yeah, it's a great way to get some experience in a more competitive format.
[14:50.05]We saw the Highlander before.
[14:51.83]There will be the 6v6, North American versus European, later in this event.
[14:57.10]I believe that's tomorrow.
[14:58.40]And when you guys donate, that's another thing.
[15:00.23]When you can...
[15:01.75]Allow yourself to put those funds toward an incentive or a bid war.
[15:05.72]And we saw before how the North Americans won the bid war and the server was located on North American soil.
[15:13.53]But Avonville may be this time for the real competitive match.
[15:18.02]It should be located in Europe.
[15:20.41]Yeah, I think that would only be fair.
[15:22.39]Or even if they alternated it back and forth, but this incentive is super powerful, you know?
[15:27.22]Are we not playing competitive right now?
[15:28.65]Okay.
[15:30.19]I'm taking this as serious as possible.
[15:32.36]I'm a four-star Pyro.
[15:34.67]So we have a $50 anonymous donation in.
[15:38.80]The comment is, question four, admirable.
[15:41.18]Can you confirm or deny that Americans mispronounce jam as jelly?
[15:47.07]You know, I was originally of the view that jam and jelly were the same thing.
[15:54.57]But since I came to the American heartland here,
[15:58.95]I've been educated by Tyke.
[16:01.06]He took me to Dunkin' Donuts and he showed me.
[16:04.43]Somebody said Dunkin' Donuts.
[16:08.44]I just heard Dunkin' Donuts is the best place.
[16:10.37]Actually, it's not the best place anymore.
[16:12.93]It's still pretty good.
[16:14.09]Yeah, so the lore behind that comment is I was at I-55, the international TFT land event.
[16:21.84]I was asking at all of these restaurants for jelly for my toast at breakfast restaurants.
[16:27.90]Little did I know that jelly in Europe is jello or jello.
[16:33.85]So people were looking at me like I was crazy because they thought I was asking to put jello on my toast for breakfast.
[16:41.61]And no one stopped to just let me know, hey, we call it jam here.
[16:45.36]So they just let me for two days just ask for gelatin on my toast.
[16:48.82]And then when I told them, no, jelly and jam are pretty much the same thing in the United States.
[16:53.32]I was crazy.
[16:54.09]You know, I thought there was a little bit of a distinction with the way Jelly and Jam were here on the stage.
[16:58.47]Jam's a little bit more, I think, purated, whereas Jelly has a little bit more.
[17:02.44]Yeah, Jelly, it's pretty much just like clumps to it.
[17:05.11]Jelly's just pretty much just pure sugar.
[17:06.97]The Jam is the one that has more of the fruit in it.
[17:09.31]We should have had a jelly expert or a jam expert here.
[17:12.51]Yeah, we really should have.
[17:13.93]At this rate, I think you both are well-qualified.
[17:19.30]Welcome to Tip of the Hats.
[17:20.68]We talk about jam and jelly.
[17:22.26]We do have two anonymous donations, $50 a pop, and both of them say, Jerma is love, Jerma is life.
[17:30.35]Let's owe some Jerma love here.
[17:31.67]Wait, is it that Jerma inspires love?
[17:33.80]I don't know.
[17:35.18]We were talking about that earlier.
[17:37.52]That's strange.
[17:38.78]Oh, we have a mask.
[17:40.25]Oh my god.
[17:43.67]You would think that they would stop going through that teleporter.
[17:47.28]I think there might be a spy there.
[17:50.82]Go through with the Dead Ringer.
[17:54.55]Oh, he's dead, Jim.
[17:57.16]You guys want to... Oh, don't even.
[17:59.98]What happens if I stand on this teleporter?
[18:05.81]Oh, you almost got it.
[18:06.77]I almost did.
[18:08.61]Awesome.
[18:10.28]Everyone's dying from just standing on the teleporter now.
[18:14.32]Oh, he tried to use the dead ring and he couldn't.
[18:18.91]What else is getting through?
[18:20.08]Blue team, can we take this a little bit more seriously?
[18:23.46]There just needs to be a new game mode.
[18:26.09]We need clearer comms right now.
[18:27.69]There needs to be a new game mode where one team just goes through a teleporter and the other team just tries to taunt kill them.
[18:34.02]Who destroyed it?
[18:36.34]Who just stopped for the fun?
[18:38.06]That's actually what matchmaking is going to be like.
[18:42.21]I'm hearing from Robin Walker right now.
[18:44.63]THAT'S EXACTLY WHAT IT IS.
[18:45.91]RIGHT.
[18:46.54]YEAH, MUCH TO EVERYBODY'S CHEGRIN AND SURPRISE, THAT'S ACTUALLY WHAT IT IS.
[18:50.42]WE DO HAVE A $100 DONATION FROM EL GRIFFO.
[18:55.99]DIDN'T LEAVE A MESSAGE, BUT $100, THANK YOU VERY MUCH.
[18:58.86]AND ALSO A $200 DONATION FROM ANONYMOUS, ALSO WITHOUT A MESSAGE, BUT THOSE ARE LARGE SUMS, AND WE WANT TO THANK YOU GUYS FOR OPENING UP YOUR HEARTS
[19:06.05]in your wallets.

[19:11.01]You can also help us out by spreading the word on your various social media outlets.
[19:16.14]Getting as many people as here as possible to spread the word about One Step Camp is what we're here to do.
[19:20.99]We want to thank you guys for joining us here today.
[19:23.73]We are racking up these donations, man.
[19:26.27]This incentive, Flora's Lava, it could happen.
[19:30.12]It is very fun.
[19:31.26]It is the absolute most fun MG map there is.
[19:34.26]I agree.
[19:34.76]100%.
[19:36.67]I've played it against so many people who swear they hate MG and will never play it, but they love playing Granary Lava.
[19:42.83]It is the best map.
[19:43.90]It is the most fun map.
[19:45.10]I hate MG.
[19:46.06]Me and you have played MG Lava for four hours straight.
[19:51.55]Yeah.
[19:53.31]Who's actually playing in the MGE tournament?
[19:55.54]I assume everyone that's sitting over there.
[19:57.74]No.
[19:59.03]I am not.

[20:08.85]Yeah, Shrugger's in it.
[20:09.91]I might be the only one here.
[20:11.15]I'm just coaching people for it.
[20:13.03]I think actually, uh, Mayland Siegel will be joining us on the couch for that segment to, uh, I think so, yeah, to, uh, give us a little bit of that invite, insight into, uh, into how to deal.
[20:26.59]Please explain how a counter jump works and why it's the only strategy.
[20:31.09]If you die, you have to complain in chat, right?

[21:20.00]I make this donation requesting Jerma to pocket star with the Kritz Creek, but if they don't want to, that's fine too.
[21:25.79]And there's some other stuff that goes on.
[21:27.33]Don't call for Kritz.
[21:28.13]We're going to admit there.
[21:29.45]Thank you very much for the 700 big words, as we call them in New York.
[21:35.04]It's all going to go to charity, so thank you very much.

[22:47.22]Big chocolate bar is going up.
[22:48.54]The blueberry to the right is not quite in play.
[22:53.05]It looks like... Where did he go?
[22:55.07]The blueberry is a very technical term.
[22:56.97]Where did he go?
[22:57.63]The guy just disappeared.
[23:00.37]Is that guy a magician?
[23:01.76]I killed him.
[23:02.76]He went to the health kit.
[23:03.90]Have you played this map?
[23:05.08]It's Badwater.
[23:06.18]It's pretty new.
[23:09.34]I was trying to wrap around him.

[23:22.94]How does that sound?
[23:23.88]Okay, that sounds fantastic.
[23:25.49]We're totally not gonna get targeted by everyone.
[23:28.05]We got a $10 anonymous donation.
[23:30.53]Ask Benny, how is the cat?
[23:33.94]How's the cat?
[23:34.88]Oh, Little Gray, he's great.
[23:36.50]It's okay.
[23:37.10]I made sure he's gonna survive this weekend.
[23:40.68]His name is Little Gray?
[23:41.94]Yeah, little gray.
[23:42.72]Little gray.
[23:43.36]Is this a new cat or... No, I've had him since I moved to California, June 1st of last year.
[23:48.42]We already had our one-year anniversary.
[23:51.22]Aw.
[23:52.69]Blag.
[23:53.27]Blag.
[23:53.65]I'm blagging.
[23:54.83]Does he like competitive?
[23:56.63]He loves it.
[23:57.41]His favorite class is spy, actually.
[23:59.45]Is it?
[24:00.03]That's not competitive.
[24:00.79]Me too.
[24:01.65]I'm joking.
[24:02.43]That's fake.
[24:03.88]Star, this is for $100.
[24:05.78]You better make this count.
[24:07.34]I'm doing it.
[24:07.80]We're going it.
[24:08.30]Let's go.
[24:08.90]Let's do this.
[24:09.76]Hold on.
[24:10.22]They got a spy behind you.
[24:13.53]I'm dead.
[24:16.23]There's a spy behind you, and you're going to blame me that a pyro walked in the door and killed you, aren't you?
[24:21.54]Yeah.
[24:23.29]You should have been aware.
[24:25.78]We have a nice $50 donation from an anonymous donor donor says two years running hard to believe It's also amazing that we are double what we had this time last year and almost up to the total we raised last year Thank you for everything you do guys.
[24:44.17]I'm sure one-step camp really appreciates it Yeah, and they do and thank you guys for watching.
[24:49.32]We did have Jeff the president of one-step camp here on the couch earlier
[24:55.76]We've hit the $80,000 mark.
[24:57.89]And we just hit $80,000, pointed out by Admirable.
[25:01.01]So thank you, guys.
[25:02.19]Of course, 100% of those donations do go to One Step Camp.
[25:05.06]We had a nice video, a nice little intro video about One Step Camp with the children that I'm sure will be airing throughout the event.
[25:11.83]But thank you, guys.
[25:12.51]$80,000 already.
[25:13.85]We're like four hours into it.
[25:15.68]And we have plenty to go.
[25:16.84]It's a 36-hour event nonstop.
[25:18.88]So thank you guys for watching at home.
[25:20.21]Thank you for donating and keep it coming.
[25:22.45]When you do donate, you do have a list of raffles you can enter into.
[25:26.70]And to get an extra bang for your buck, you can go ahead and look at all the incentives.
[25:30.93]You don't have to donate again to be a part of the incentives.
[25:33.43]You can just go to the next scroll drop-down box and pick which incentive you want.
[25:37.16]There's plenty there.
[25:38.52]In this hour leading up to that MGE event, guys, we are trying to raise 5,000 by then, and we'll be able to have the MGE finalists play in a the map is, or the ground is lava granary map, and that's going to be very exciting.
[25:53.54]Mela over there on the gaming table, he highly recommends it, and I'm excited to see it.
[25:58.52]Let's pretend I don't need it, and here's my donation message.
[26:01.21]Truck truck, you're doing God's work by how dumbed down your pyro play is.
[26:06.45]Maybe if you keep this up, Valve will balance it.
[26:11.18]Or buff it again.
[26:12.74]Yeah, they should buff it again.
[26:14.56]So we got anonymous $20 and one cent donation playing that penny game.
[26:18.77]Thanks for doing this great cause, and thanks Jerma and Star for being awesome YouTubers.
[26:23.87]Wow, what a bunch of funny YouTubers we are.
[26:26.38]Thanks, man.
[26:28.36]Thanks.

[26:32.29]I'm up here.
[26:33.27]Oh, my God.
[26:34.56]He's complaining about pyros when he could be doing some frags.
[26:39.71]I have an open platform.
[26:40.75]It's time to let my worldviews of TF2 get some attention over here.
[26:45.56]Can you hit E?

[26:59.12]Okay, you ready?
[26:59.57]Watch out.

[28:22.38]Mouses is good.
[28:23.26]I'm sorry.

[28:25.50]Okay.
[28:27.03]But they provided some mice for us, which are also part of the raffle, which you guys can get in.
[28:31.45]So thank you very much to all those organizations for helping us out and making this possible.
[28:39.12]It's just pyro.
[28:39.94]And also tragic servers for donating the usage of servers to us as well.
[28:44.01]Right, tragic servers which are allowing us to give you this fine TF2 action.
[28:48.84]You can see that up on the stream.

[28:53.04]A clutch heal.
[28:53.78]So we got a $100 donation from Blue.
[28:56.25]It says, It's been incredibly smooth so far.
[29:02.80]Don't jinx it for us, Blue.
[29:04.52]That is D. Blue.

[29:07.03]D. Blue, who is also a production boy.
[29:09.52]That's true.
[29:11.30]For Team Fortress TV.
[29:13.87]Like all the stuff you see on the stream.
[29:17.85]Is that Jackie Chan?
[29:20.30]I believe I see the tipped lid on that spy mask.
[29:23.92]I didn't know we got Jackie Chan.
[29:27.21]I don't know if I can do it.
[29:33.88]I don't think I can handle it.
[29:39.16]with Jackie Chan in a tip lead, and that's also in-game as well.
[29:43.29]Another $100 donation from Wawa saying, legitimately amazing what the TF2 community has done, is currently doing.
[29:52.30]You guys are adorable and doing some awesome work.
[29:54.98]Also, could Jerma do me a solid and say hi to my friend, BluePhoenixBear.
[30:00.63]Hey, BluePhoenixBear.
[30:02.31]What's going on, dude?
[30:04.25]Nice.
[30:05.98]Can't reply.
[30:09.85]What are you doing?
[30:10.67]I just got turned into cream soda.
[30:15.74]Cream soda?
[30:16.34]Why cream?
[30:18.58]That's all I thought of.
[30:19.95]How did you get carbonated in that?
[30:22.68]I don't know.
[30:24.85]Maybe I want a cream soda right now.
[30:26.29]Maybe I should get one.
[30:27.01]That actually does sound pretty good.
[30:27.97]They're delicious.
[30:28.66]They are pretty good.
[30:29.30]If you want to ask my opinion.
[30:31.68]We were making fun of the cream soda.
[30:33.43]But honestly, we both know cream soda is pretty good.
[30:35.97]Cream soda is delicious.
[30:37.89]Another $300 donation from an anonymous donor saying the floor is lava.
[30:44.12]So not quite yet, but hopefully if we can reach that 5,000 stretch goal soon, we'll get there.
[30:51.59]The floor is actually primordial ooze.
[30:54.00]Anybody will back me up on this.
[30:56.87]Well, it looks like we have a guest celebrity joining us on the couch.
[31:00.68]You guys know him as Mr. Slyn.
[31:02.78]Slyn, also working at Twitch.
[31:05.00]Twitch, of course, helping us power this event.
[31:07.52]How's it doing?
[31:08.06]Hey, how's it going, Slyn?
[31:09.12]It's awesome.
[31:09.56]I just came here to spice it up because I figured these guys need a break to go get lunch.
[31:13.39]Yeah, I actually smell Chipotle on your brother.
[31:15.07]We got a little bit of a Chipotle run going on there.
[31:17.05]We got a bunch of burritos.
[31:18.01]Came back.
[31:19.01]Went with Bear.
[31:19.71]That was good.
[31:21.04]Drove in his car.
[31:21.84]His car has a bunch of dog...
[31:24.48]hair in it.
[31:26.04]It's beautiful.
[31:28.11]I love dog hair.
[31:29.85]Yeah, so how are things going with the pubbing?
[31:32.37]Going pretty well.
[31:33.41]We can see Star and Jerma are doing their darn best.
[31:35.96]Yeah, Star's getting carried by Jerma as usual.
[31:38.20]Yeah.
[31:38.74]But it's going well.
[31:39.56]Yeah, that's pretty normal.
[31:40.35]And he's getting lucky.
[31:41.19]He's probably going to die right now.
[31:42.25]He's overextended.
[31:42.79]Dude, I learned that the only way I don't get pocket medic'd in this pub is if Star and Jerma are in the server.
[31:48.46]You have to fight for yourself.
[31:50.30]I know.
[31:51.04]And Seagull is just shutting down everything Star and Jerma do, pretty much.
[31:55.23]I learned the best from Truck Truck, you know, Backburner Pyro.
[31:59.50]Dude, the only thing better than a Backburner Pyro is two.
[32:03.00]Hey, Truck Truck, you're a Pyro professional.
[32:05.75]Can you tell me why does the Backburner have random crits?
[32:09.76]Does it?
[32:10.52]No, it doesn't.
[32:11.24]No, it doesn't.
[32:11.68]Yeah, it does.
[32:12.30]Can you read the lore for once?
[32:13.86]Can you read the item right now?
[32:15.93]It's in the lore, not the item.
[32:18.23]Oh, my God.
[32:19.14]Was it episode 13?
[32:20.62]Episode 13.
[32:21.54]That's the one I forget every time.
[32:23.41]Yeah, duh.
[32:24.39]That wasn't a very good episode.
[32:26.79]It was kind of spooky.
[32:28.22]It was a little too much filler.
[32:31.16]I don't... I don't... So I saw we hit 80k.
[32:34.87]We hit $80,000.
[32:35.75]That is really impressive.
[32:37.47]Very impressive.
[32:38.03]We've been only live for, what, like four hours or something?
[32:40.09]Yeah, we're only about four hours into the event.
[32:42.34]80k.
[32:43.12]Already reaching 80k, and it keeps going up.
[32:45.60]And that's not including, since you're here from Twitch, the Teespring campaign.
[32:50.15]Right.
[32:50.73]Featuring the shirt much like this one with the Twitch logo on the side.
[32:55.00]No, yeah.
[32:55.22]It's been crazy, like, the amount of support that we've been getting so far for this event.
[32:59.22]I mean, a lot of love from Kif too.
[33:01.13]That's awesome.
[33:02.05]Yeah, we saw Twitch tweeted us out.
[33:03.83]You know, we're on that front page a little bit, so thank you to that, helping us spread the word about what we're trying to do here.
[33:10.72]But $80,000, guys, that's absolutely fantastic.
[33:14.25]Keep it coming.
[33:15.15]It goes to a great cause.
[33:16.29]And in the meantime, you can get lots of cool TF2 items, actual merchandise.
[33:21.50]We have this amazing, beautiful handmade quilt that you guys can enter into.
[33:27.61]And there's also tons of incentives and a lot of good prizes for you guys to get while you help charity.
[33:33.53]So I think, has the pub ended?
[33:36.68]I'm not sure.
[33:37.44]Let's change maps.
[33:38.36]We're switching maps.
[33:39.26]We're changing maps here.
[33:40.31]So, yeah, I just want to say, you know, Slin here is a long-standing TF2 community member.
[33:45.62]You've been doing a lot of streams.
[33:46.66]You've been playing competitive a lot.
[33:48.72]Recently you got hired at Twitch, so now you're Twitch Slin.
[33:52.07]I don't want to be called that.
[33:53.63]I don't like that.
[33:54.53]I'm not an enthusiast.
[33:57.41]Just slim.
[33:58.35]I've never worn these headphones before.
[34:00.06]They're actually incredible.
[34:01.40]You see them on all the fancy casts.
[34:03.44]I've never actually worn them before.
[34:04.86]The mic quality is super high.
[34:07.46]We have them in large part thanks to our Twitch sponsor.
[34:10.71]Thank you for that.
[34:12.61]I was just saying, this event has been so much fun because there's so many of you guys that I actually haven't met in real life before.
[34:19.68]We hung out and spent thousands of hours online seeing each other.
[34:23.04]And then in person, being able to... I just can't stop touching him.
[34:27.11]I just love... Spread the love.
[34:28.59]I love it.
[34:29.45]I love it.
[34:29.87]It's amazing.
[34:31.39]I wish all of you guys here online were here to hang out with us because it's been so much fun.
[34:35.60]Even just basics, just going out to dinner last night or lunch now.
[34:38.81]I mean, it's been fun.
[34:39.71]We were saying it's great to have the community on site, or like community heads, community figures on site, able to be here and meet each other.
[34:46.02]This is the first time you've been on site for a TNT.
[34:48.68]Right, this is the first time that I've been here to meet everybody.
[34:50.79]Isn't it your first time on a plane?
[34:53.95]Yes, yes.
[34:54.77]Tell us about it.
[34:55.45]I want to know.
[34:56.20]Was there turbulence?
[34:57.14]It was fine.
[34:58.38]You know, a lot of people talk about taking off and landing, and I didn't think much of that.
[35:01.42]Did you chew bubble gum?
[35:03.01]Because that's like a thing.
[35:03.79]I didn't chew bubble gum and I was right next to the wing actually.
[35:07.50]But I was okay.
[35:08.18]It was a smaller plane.
[35:10.70]We hit some turbulence mid-flight and I don't like roller coasters.
[35:13.33]I don't like any sort of amusement park rides.
[35:15.53]So it went up and down for a little.
[35:16.74]It rolled and I'm kind of going with it.
[35:19.16]And then it went like up, down.
[35:20.30]You get that stomach dropping feeling.
[35:22.03]You didn't drop that, did you?
[35:23.45]No, no, I was okay.
[35:24.75]I was listening to some audiobooks and closing my eyes.
[35:28.34]What audiobook?
[35:29.00]I'm just curious.
[35:29.60]What does Bloodside listen to when he's on a plane?
[35:32.96]I was actually listening to a Stephen King novel.
[35:38.17]Oh, Stephen King.
[35:39.63]Good guy.
[35:40.68]Which one?
[35:41.96]There's a whole lot of good ones.
[35:42.96]The Stand.
[35:43.14]The stand, actually.
[35:44.16]Okay, very good.
[35:44.78]So shout-out to Stephen King, I guess.
[35:46.56]Maybe we can get a tweet at Stephen King.
[35:50.37]We got a lot of Stephen King shout-outs going on.
[35:52.51]We are, in the next hour, going to be having our MGE competition, and we're going to have Banny, Shrugger, Alpha, Mike, that's MGE Mike, Tweek, Stark, Ash, and Sideshow.
[36:04.26]They're going to be competing in that event.
[36:06.43]And, of course, we're trying to raise that stretch goal of $5,000.
[36:10.85]If we meet that... Got him.
[36:12.23]The winner of the championship round in that MGE will go on to face each other on a granary map that has a floor that's lava.
[36:20.87]And we hear it's very funny and exciting to watch.
[36:23.57]So when you donate, you don't have to donate any more towards that goal.
[36:26.87]It's just when you donate now, you can click that incentive and have your donation amount go towards that goal.
[36:33.87]And we would all like to see that here.
[36:35.13]So keep the donations coming.
[36:36.83]Again, 100% of the proceeds do go to One Step Camp.
[36:45.10]And we have a $20 donation from Anonymous who says, yo, everyone there is awesome.
[36:50.89]Keep playing games for the kids.
[36:53.42]For the kids.
[36:54.94]For the kids.
[36:55.72]Yeah, keep those donations coming.
[36:56.90]It's great to see you guys opening up your hearts and your minds, Slyndon.
[37:00.81]You know, you've tuned in the last two years, and we were talking about before about how, you know, we're already past $80,000.
[37:06.37]That's crazy.
[37:07.53]It's just fantastic.
[37:08.38]And it's also a really good cause, too.
[37:09.76]I mean, I was talking to Mala and Seabear, who were originally, like, you know, talking about how they've actually been to One Step Camp themselves.
[37:16.07]Right.
[37:16.31]And seen it themselves, and they said, like, the amount of care and attention that they give to these kids is amazing.
[37:21.54]Right.
[37:21.80]Every single year that they do it.
[37:22.94]And it's like, I think it's like a week-long camp.
[37:24.34]They do two different sessions, and all the kids get to have so much fun that they wouldn't have otherwise.
[37:29.25]It's an opportunity for them to actually, like, just be themselves for...
[37:32.57]EVEN IF IT'S JUST A WEEK, YOU KNOW?
[37:33.92]I THINK IT'S SOMETHING LIKE $1,000 SENDS A KID TO CAMP, $2,000 SENDS A KID TO CAMP FOR TWO WEEKS.
[37:38.57]AND MOLLY WAS HERE ON THE COUCH BEFORE.
[37:40.57]SHE WAS A NURSE.
[37:42.02]SHE'S BEEN THERE, I THINK, FOR THE LAST FEW YEARS.
[37:44.52]AND SHE WAS MENTIONING HOW, YOU KNOW, WHEN THEY NEED MEDICINE OR, YOU KNOW, THEY NEED MEDICAL ATTENTION, THE KIDS AREN'T DISRUPTED IN THEIR...
[37:51.46]Right.
[37:51.68]Well, they have doctors on site.
[37:53.24]Right.
[37:53.38]Doctors go to them.
[37:54.28]All day long.
[37:54.76]They're allowed to just be kids, not have to worry about any routine dealing with cancer like that.
[37:59.99]They're just there to be kids, to have fun, to build friendships, to build memories.
[38:03.74]And that's what it's all about.
[38:04.62]That's what we're about in gaming.
[38:05.80]We're talking about, you know, meeting the community, meeting each other, forming this close-knit group of friends.
[38:10.93]And that's what One Stamp Camp does for the children.
[38:13.41]It's a great event.
[38:14.47]We want to thank everybody for watching.
[38:16.59]Oh, yeah.
[38:17.30]Okay, that's Malo.
[38:19.00]Someone's using the Soda Popper.
[38:21.64]The only person in the entire Team Fortress 2 video game.
[38:25.23]That's Melee.
[38:25.93]Wasn't me.
[38:28.13]We also have Seagull on Engineer.
[38:31.98]Isn't Engineer your favorite class?
[38:35.22]That's what I've heard from you, Seagull.
[38:37.99]If you were pubbing as any class, Engineer would be it.
[38:40.67]Are you using the Gunslinger?
[38:43.80]So you're basically a scumbag.
[38:45.34]Well, if you think about it in terms of, you know, I'm playing in a pub.
[39:00.59]I mean, pubs are all about one pyro, two Mini-Sentries.
[39:04.82]It's like, I can't play one or the other.
[39:06.32]I mean, what am I doing in a pub?
[39:08.06]You are that guy in a pub that everyone is just like, who's that guy who's in the Mini-Sentry?
[39:13.16]Oh, it's Seagull.
[39:15.03]Yeah.
[39:15.31]We have a nice $200 donation from an anonymous donor once again.
[39:18.55]I wish I could play on the pub, but watching is fun too.
[39:22.14]Thank you for watching.
[39:23.36]Thank you for that generous donation.
[39:25.18]Again, when you guys include your Steam ID, you are automatically entered to receive a Jaunty Pin, which is an in-game TF2 item that will be distributed after the event.
[39:34.55]Everybody who donates and includes, well, you have to donate a cumulative of $20.
[39:39.15]And if you include your Steam ID, you will be getting that wearable Jaunty Pin limited time.
[39:44.44]See you later, Ben.
[39:45.16]wearable item.
[39:46.62]So thank you guys for those donations and make sure you guys can get that.
[39:51.45]So who's got the worst loadout out of everyone?
[39:53.33]Like who's using the most, the least effective loadout?
[39:56.78]Well, it's a Pob, so it's pretty debatable.
[39:57.90]Probably Banny.
[39:58.88]He's just playing Spy.
[40:02.32]I mean, you know, there's a reason why Clockwork always goes Spy and not Banny.
[40:06.17]It's true.
[40:06.87]I like how we can see our four gamers, and then we see Grant's head there just peeking out from his very much inclined position.
[40:16.26]He's always the... What would you describe it?
[40:19.13]I want to say slouch.
[40:21.01]Just a lean back.
[40:22.39]He likes to be comfortable.
[40:23.67]An extreme lean.
[40:25.56]That's what it is.
[40:26.18]Extreme lean.
[40:27.08]No, because when he's at home, he only puts his head on the top of the chair.
[40:29.72]He can't do that on the chair that he's got right now.
[40:31.58]He can't really rest his head back on his... Yeah, I got to lean forward a little.
[40:34.25]And then it looks like you're just on like a...
[40:36.09]gurney or something.
[40:37.27]I think even at lands, though, I've seen pictures of him just with that insane incline.
[40:41.64]Like, you can see from the bottom of his head.
[40:43.16]See, no, I do the lean sometimes, but it's usually when I'm, like, really, really relaxing and everything.
[40:48.59]I usually sit up when I'm trying to extreme game.
[40:51.77]Right.
[40:52.35]Well, little did you know, the secret to be the best in tier two is to incline.
[40:56.68]Steep incline.
[40:57.42]Oh, really?
[40:58.14]Is that your secret?
[40:59.34]That's Banny's secret.
[41:00.41]It's not my secret.
[41:01.19]You said you have to elevate?
[41:02.07]I thought you meant, like, forward.
[41:03.47]You have to de-elevate.
[41:05.03]I see.
[41:05.40]I get it.
[41:05.94]I get it.
[41:06.58]Mayla, can you laugh at that joke, please?
[41:08.80]Ooh, I got a spy achievement.
[41:10.75]Nice, Chief.
[41:11.55]1,000 backstabs.
[41:12.51]Congrats on your achievement.
[41:13.87]Hearing truck trucks laugh in real life is amazing, by the way.
[41:16.38]It's, like, A+.
[41:18.06]It really is.
[41:18.64]It's very jovial.
[41:19.64]The other thing, too, that I was surprised about was that, because I'm 5'10", I thought, you know, I'm average height, but everyone here is like a giant.
[41:25.72]Yeah, I don't want to hear it.
[41:29.29]We could form a TF2 basketball team.
[41:32.95]Really good.
[41:33.50]There's nothing more intimidating than a bunch of tall men.
[41:37.78]We were out and about, you know, standing around in various huddles throughout the event while we were setting up, and every time I get into one of those huddles, I kind of feel like a bush among redwoods.
[41:51.21]A bush among redwoods.
[41:52.83]Yes, redwood trees, yes.
[41:57.82]We have a $20 donation.
[41:59.40]Anonymous says, Star, please talk about the time when Jerma gave you that coffee cup with nothing in it.
[42:06.69]He embellishes that story so much.
[42:11.26]That was actually my tip of the hat.
[42:13.42]Please go watch the video from last year.
[42:15.33]Dude, you're living in the past.
[42:17.21]That's his favorite story to tell.
[42:18.47]Please excuse me, I'm sorry.
[42:19.61]I'm a jerk.
[42:23.22]Jerma insulted a group of men and they all, like...
[42:27.90]I did not do anything.
[42:29.61]I think I'm embellishing.
[42:30.95]Banny, you gotta pick something here.
[42:33.38]He's going for it.
[42:35.65]Alright, tell me what you're thinking right now.
[42:37.87]I'm thinking kill, kill, kill.
[42:41.02]If we could open up Banny's mind and see the console log, it would just be kill, kill, kill.
[42:49.77]Kill.
[42:50.47]Oh, okay.
[42:54.04]Got him, though.
[42:55.48]Yeah, at least he got the frag, guys.
[42:57.78]At least he got the frag.
[42:58.38]Isn't that the Critscast hat?
[43:00.11]I think someone saw it was wearing a scout hat with the Critscast, like, the antenna on it.
[43:04.67]Mm-hmm.
[43:04.79]That's a pretty rare hat, I think.
[43:05.85]Speaking of hats, you can, in the store, in the Valve store, you can go ahead and purchase the tipped lid hat, which if we can pan out, looks very much like the one we have in the center table here.
[43:15.91]You can get that.
[43:17.56]The proceeds will, some of the proceeds will be going to One Step Camp.
[43:21.33]Is that a mug I see here, too?
[43:22.31]That is a mug, a One Step Camp mug.
[43:24.45]You have a tip of the hat smug.
[43:27.29]Behind me, we have the Twitch t-shirt.
[43:30.08]Maybe you can tell us a little bit about how you were able to smuggle those out of the Twitch headquarters, because as far as I know, you cannot buy those.
[43:37.00]You cannot buy them.
[43:38.19]Actually, that was hard to get.
[43:39.69]The purple ones?
[43:40.81]Those were actually really rare.
[43:41.91]Were you fired for bringing those?
[43:43.79]It was a struggle, actually.
[43:45.71]What would you call them, the rarity scale?
[43:47.42]The hoodie or the shirt?
[43:48.54]Is it past the diamond?
[43:49.62]Yeah, the hoodie is a completely different story.
[43:51.44]That one's untouchable.
[43:53.18]Past the diamond.
[43:53.98]The shirt, though, you can, as a donation incentive for that, you can actually get yourself into one of the raffles that we have for different sizes.
[44:03.38]Right, yeah, when you donate, you can pick to see if you want your donation amount to go towards the extremely rare Twitch shirt.
[44:11.01]Very rare.
[44:11.75]I'm going to get myself in on that.
[44:14.56]I won one of those last year, and it shrunk in the wash a little bit, and maybe you could send me more.
[44:21.19]I think Justin is going to get us all some lunch here in a second.
[44:25.93]Yeah, I think I'm going to go eat because I'm all dry-mouthed and hungry.
[44:29.06]I'm going to go ahead and swap in the old Alex.
[44:32.23]Alright, so we're going to bring in one of your old teammates then.
[44:35.97]Yeah, let's not talk about him.
[44:38.33]Alright, so yeah, we're going to do some swap-outs because our food just got here.
[44:41.73]It's getting kind of chilly, kind of cold.
[44:43.40]We don't like cold food.
[44:44.94]So I'm going to sign out, and hopefully I don't die.
[44:49.52]Big shout-out to Tag and Justin holding down the fort.
[44:51.37]Tag's just going to see Miss Pauling.
[44:53.87]Yeah, that's what it is.
[44:55.87]He's got a contract.
[44:57.35]She's at the event?
[45:00.12]When I die, she's like, soldier, got a contract for you.
[45:05.74]She's always got something for me.
[45:07.62]So welcome to the couch.
[45:08.32]We've got Seabear, our awesome host.
[45:10.50]I'm on a chair.
[45:11.54]He's on the host chair.
[45:12.75]And we've got Mala, who's amazingly good at Counter-Strike from what she's been telling me all day long.
[45:18.21]No, no, terrible at Counter-Strike.
[45:19.42]She's apparently very good at it.
[45:20.68]She's being modest.
[45:21.22]She's being modest.
[45:21.86]She's very good.
[45:23.88]We'll see.
[45:24.20]We'll see.
[45:24.56]So we've just been hanging out, doing the pub life, you know?
[45:27.37]Lunchpotle.
[45:28.47]Lunchpotle.
[45:28.67]Chipotle is amazing.
[45:31.09]They're not paying me to say that.
[45:33.72]No, we just paid them.
[45:35.24]We had to double back like three times to make sure we got the right stuff.
[45:41.07]You know who eats a lot is Enigma.
[45:43.21]I swear he eats there like at least three, four days a week.
[45:46.11]That guy loves Chipotle.
[45:49.66]Yeah, so Slynn paid for him and Twitch.
[45:53.95]Got us all lunch because he's a god.
[45:56.35]Thank you for that very much.
[45:57.94]And we have the MGE tournament coming up.
[46:02.16]And there's an incentive that $5,000, the floor is lava finals rematch.
[46:07.92]That sounds interesting.
[46:09.32]I like that a lot.
[46:09.88]I think we can do that.
[46:10.62]I don't know where we're at right now.
[46:11.43]I think we can definitely do that.
[46:12.21]I should be able to find that.
[46:12.97]What if one of the people's a scout?
[46:14.21]How does that work?
[46:15.19]The floor is lava.
[46:16.53]The goofed.
[46:17.84]I'm pretty sure you can't even go scoutin' them, so.
[46:21.10]You can boss and basher jump everywhere.
[46:22.84]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[46:23.55]That's a thing.
[46:24.13]Yeah.
[46:24.73]They have scout jump maps that are actually extremely difficult.
[46:27.01]You have to Boston Bash your way to the top of a room.
[46:29.24]Those are so hard to do.
[46:30.70]Sounds fun.
[46:31.86]We have MG coming up.
[46:32.86]And Fanny told me earlier that he needed to warm up.
[46:35.59]Are you getting warmed up there, Grant?
[46:36.55]Are you good?
[46:37.67]Yeah.
[46:37.95]I'm getting comfortable.
[46:40.24]Banny, we were joking around out in the main area that it's funny because we have this shot of you guys playing, as one of the cameras pointed at you guys, that one right there, and everyone's pretty good posture-wise, and then you're slowly melting.
[46:54.19]The floor is lava right beneath Banny, actually, which is pretty awesome.
[46:58.09]You're, like, almost out of the shot, so we're fine.
[47:00.72]I've got to be comfortable.
[47:02.74]That's the number one priority for me.
[47:04.56]The edge of the shot.
[47:05.58]Tips and tricks.
[47:06.58]It's funny.
[47:07.46]I also, I don't see any YZ50 keyboard in the lap tactics anymore.
[47:13.76]Yeah, like the Russian... That was popular for a while when YZ was the best scout.
[47:17.43]A few people copied him.
[47:18.85]They thought it would take him to the top.
[47:21.63]Well, there's the other thing, too, where you put your elbow on the desk to give you extra stability.
[47:25.25]Wasn't Lang doing that a while back?
[47:27.18]That's an interesting tactic.
[47:28.22]Yeah, you put your whole entire arm.
[47:30.54]Listen, all it does is hurt after a while.
[47:34.50]Really?
[47:34.62]Okay, good to know.
[47:35.71]Got some nerve injuries going on there.
[47:37.55]Yeah.
[47:37.85]You also have to kind of sit sideways, too, like parallel to the desk.
[47:40.67]Yeah, I feel like it would throw you off a little bit.
[47:42.09]Yeah, I don't know if I'd be down for that.
[47:43.32]Yeah.
[47:43.82]I actually did do the keyboard in my lap, though, because, you know, at home, we got the microphone on the desk.
[47:48.72]So if I'm pushing the keyboard, it'll make a lot of noise.
[47:51.35]So I put it in my lap, but it actually hurts my wrist so much because, like, the angle's so bad.
[47:56.56]Not worth it.
[47:56.84]So it's not worth it, no.
[47:58.46]You know what?
[47:58.76]Carpal tunnel.
[47:59.46]Yeah.
[48:00.42]It's never good.
[48:01.12]It's way too good to be my age, but, you know.
[48:05.23]Wow.
[48:05.53]So when we left for Chipotle, I want to say we were just bringing it up.
[48:10.06]Well, I just saw that, I mean, you can barely see the grand total because it's always some other donation coming in, but we're at $81,600.
[48:16.11]Is that what I just saw?
[48:18.13]We just passed $81,000.
[48:20.21]Wow.
[48:20.51]That's an insane amount, and I think we're only, I think this is the fourth hour or so, fifth hour, if that even.
[48:25.63]See, I was worried that TF2 was dead.
[48:29.30]Now, here we go on day one, being alive and everything.
[48:32.30]Bringing TF2 back.
[48:33.16]The tip of the hat is like consistently top 10 charity events on Twitch every year.
[48:37.35]Oh, absolutely.
[48:37.85]And it's all due in part to the massive support from you.
[48:42.14]Is that a banana?
[48:43.62]Please, yes.
[48:44.46]I would love that.
[48:46.24]Oh, my God.
[48:46.84]You're amazing.
[48:47.61]Thank you.
[48:49.65]Thank you, Tag.
[48:50.51]I'm not going to.
[48:50.87]I'm not watching the stream right now.
[48:52.11]On stream, nice.
[48:54.60]Can we zoom in?
[48:55.68]Sorry, I didn't want to distract you guys.
[48:56.76]Well, we know which shots are going to come up next here.
[48:59.36]That's a donation inside of it too, right?
[49:02.17]Twitch chat, you can give tag.
[49:04.07]That was tag who delivered the banana.
[49:05.73]So you have to eat it, come on.
[49:08.27]I just had lunch, you know, I'm so full.
[49:09.97]Okay, you don't even have to eat it.
[49:10.94]You just have to do one specific thing.
[49:13.18]Okay, you guys are here after dark.
[49:14.96]The tip of the hat is after dark.
[49:16.98]I'll be here after dark.
[49:18.22]Okay.
[49:18.30]You know?
[49:19.05]I don't want to get our shadow.
[49:21.17]He's going to eat a banana only the way Slim can.
[49:23.94]Is this not for daytime TV?
[49:25.13]It's only for nighttime TV?
[49:26.80]For the Australians.
[49:29.27]We are still getting all your donations.
[49:30.92]I just got the thing back up, so I'm reading through them.
[49:33.72]It looks like a lot of Anonymouses.
[49:36.18]I was looking at the actual donation screen, and it's not, I wouldn't say confusing, but just make sure you fill the stuff out if you want us to know who you are when you donate.
[49:45.16]Or if we like your comment or whatever catches our eye and we read it, we can read your name as well, so we can attribute the money to some kind human donation.
[49:54.87]But we are getting all of them, and again, just an insane amount of donations already, which is just great.
[50:01.50]We have, like, 30 hours still to go, people.
[50:04.80]Well, the pubbing is the best part of TF2.
[50:06.70]People don't realize that.
[50:07.56]People always say they're looking forward to the other events that happen in TOTH, but, like, pubbing is... That's what everyone plays in TF2, you know?
[50:14.29]Everyone always comes back to that.
[50:15.99]So you can always have fun with your friends when you play pubs.
[50:18.78]What happens when the matchmaking comes out, Slim?
[50:21.84]I don't know what you're talking about.
[50:23.74]I don't think it's been officially announced, Kurt.
[50:25.64]Oh, yeah?
[50:26.66]Yeah, you might be talking about something that doesn't exist.
[50:30.67]What?
[50:30.95]I don't know.
[50:31.87]Are you, like, so out of the loop, or is this, like, the weirdest troll in my life?
[50:37.78]Flynn's trying to keep it secret still.
[50:40.32]It's a secret.
[50:42.22]Yeah.
[50:43.44]There's an anonymous $50 donation.
[50:46.29]It says, as an Australian, I know what it's like to have your world turned upside down.
[50:51.28]I'm only a poor university student, but I hope even this can bring a little bit of normalcy back to kids' lives.
[50:58.71]Aw.
[50:58.79]Like for the kids.
[50:59.79]Yeah, that's funny.
[51:00.59]Yeah, for the kids.
[51:01.89]I see what you did there, Australian man.
[51:04.18]Are we doing that this year, like a hashtag TOTH2015 or like a for the kids?
[51:09.77]Yeah.
[51:10.51]Hashtag hotlang.
[51:11.15]Your tweets can get shown on stream if you use the tag.
[51:15.50]What tag is that, Kurt?
[51:17.08]TOTH2015.
[51:18.27]Not for the kids.
[51:21.45]We might pick up some random ones then.
[51:23.09]TOTH2015.
[51:24.00]We can filter them, you know?
[51:26.17]What time does the MG start?
[51:28.95]That starts in 23 minutes.
[51:30.93]Really?
[51:32.05]In theory.
[51:32.79]Are you playing that?
[51:34.52]No, I'm a host.
[51:37.90]You might want to take a break.
[51:41.31]A little breather.
[51:42.55]A little exhale.
[51:44.03]I know someone over there who might want to play some TF2.
[51:46.07]Do you want to play some TF2?
[51:48.39]Yeah, go ahead and go eat, buddy.
[51:50.72]Well, I'm going to eat a burrito.
[51:53.47]Just don't disconnect.
[51:54.33]That spot's worth multiple dollars.
[51:58.25]Burrito, huh?
[52:00.10]Sounds pretty great.
[52:04.49]I think there are multiple burritos out there.
[52:06.57]I think we got Mala and Slim ready to play.
[52:09.31]You guys ready to play?
[52:11.04]Hey, Mala, did you make the cookies?
[52:13.52]I did make the cookies.
[52:14.84]These guys can tell you I made the cookies.
[52:16.56]They're here.
[52:17.12]What kind of cookies?
[52:19.27]They're amazing.
[52:19.93]I made chocolate chip and peanut butter.
[52:22.51]Double?
[52:23.39]Two different cookies?
[52:24.33]Yeah, two different kinds of cookies.
[52:25.52]Like, two huge containers of cookies.
[52:27.32]They're not even gone yet.
[52:28.78]A ton of cookies.
[52:29.88]And, I mean, they're pretty incredible, if I do say so myself.
[52:32.65]No, they're really good.
[52:33.79]I can't cook.
[52:35.29]That's the problem I have, is I don't know how to make food.
[52:38.80]Oh, well, I can cook.
[52:39.52]Yeah.
[52:39.74]Let's go to your house and eat cookies all day long.
[52:41.90]Yeah, all the way from California to Boston.
[52:44.32]Yeah, that'd be a long trip.
[52:46.11]Long trip for some cookies.
[52:47.05]Yeah.
[52:48.09]It's actually, I was saying the last time I was in Chicago was in February, and it was 15 below.
[52:52.36]Yeah.
[52:53.24]And we couldn't even go outside.
[52:54.72]Like, my face hurt.
[52:55.36]We walked a block.
[52:56.24]You could go outside, but.
[52:57.69]No, it hurts.
[52:58.15]No, there's a rule.
[52:59.27]Well, I'm from California, so maybe I'm a little bit of a wuss when it comes to that.
[53:02.75]But, like, you know.
[53:03.40]You have to dress appropriately.
[53:04.82]Yeah.
[53:05.24]Yeah, I was only in a suit, so it wasn't very thick.
[53:07.44]Oh, you didn't have a jacket?
[53:08.30]Yeah, and I didn't have... Come on.
[53:10.77]Oh, my gosh.
[53:11.43]You sound so different.
[53:12.11]Like, honestly... But today has been beautiful outside.
[53:14.99]Dude, Malon's back.
[53:16.06]My computer feels a little different.
[53:18.50]It's not bad at all.
[53:20.22]That's pretty good.
[53:21.38]Honestly, I think I'm a little bit higher up in my seat, but I'll just deal with it.
[53:29.62]I'm hungry.
[53:32.74]That's incredible.
[53:34.18]Good stuff.
[53:35.31]I have a lot of practice.
[53:36.29]A $20 anonymous donation from some person who says, Ster, I'm not trying to be funny, but did you ever buy Jerma those curtains?
[53:44.34]Because if not, that's not cool, man.
[53:46.96]Of course you did.
[53:47.94]Ooh, what is this about?
[53:48.86]We need some backstory.
[53:50.32]Of course you did.
[53:50.84]What was that about, actually?
[53:52.69]And then I threw them into the trash.
[53:54.77]Oh, wow.
[53:55.73]Immediately.
[53:56.33]What's the backstory, though?
[53:57.45]That's funny because I bought them from someone who lived in the trash.
[54:01.99]Well, that's fine because they didn't go with my walls.
[54:05.00]Yeah.
[54:05.08]Because you have, I know you want to talk, I know you want to talk about this.
[54:09.26]Oh, yes.
[54:09.54]Yeah, let's hear about it.
[54:11.13]I do, I want to talk about this.
[54:12.61]So I did a little bit of research on the internet, I'm sure you guys have heard of it.
[54:17.49]I had an office constructed down there, that's why I wasn't around earlier today.
[54:22.90]Green, light green is considered a very balancing, nurturing color.
[54:27.64]If you don't know this, it actually, it spurs creativity.
[54:31.70]Like green?
[54:33.32]Yeah, green and yellow.
[54:36.03]I think yellow and red is what makes you hungry when you see yellow and red.
[54:40.67]I thought yellow was like calming.
[54:42.49]Red is passion.
[54:43.77]Yeah, there's McDonald's.
[54:46.14]Also the color of China.
[54:47.74]Yellow and red is the entirety of China.
[54:49.70]The color of communism.
[54:51.48]But anyways, my room is painted spearmint, like double mint green.
[54:55.50]Really?
[54:56.23]Yeah, it's actually pretty nice.
[54:57.55]You get in and it smells nice, too.
[55:00.05]Yeah, how fresh is your breath?
[55:02.04]Pretty good.
[55:02.42]I made sure it was fresh this morning, so when I got in, I could just start licking the walls and it'll help.
[55:08.29]Oh, yeah?
[55:08.49]Yeah.
[55:09.59]I was thinking about doing wallpaper and just doing just schnozberries on the walls.
[55:13.86]I thought, Jerma, I thought this curtains thing was like an inside joke.
[55:16.56]I thought it was like, oh, yeah, we're going to give, you know, it's curtains for you, Jerma.
[55:19.93]That's what I thought it was.
[55:21.69]I didn't think it was actual curtains.
[55:23.69]No, he bought them and I burnt them.
[55:26.11]But why?
[55:28.39]Because he's a terrible man.
[55:30.56]Wow.
[55:31.34]These are harsh accusations here.
[55:33.90]Every time I see my curtains.
[55:36.52]Why?
[55:37.32]No, actually, what I was going to say, the real story is I was going to buy.
[55:41.53]You got yourself.
[55:42.97]I bought blue curtains for the joke and I was going to spill wine on him in a video and be like, no, my curtains that he gave me.
[55:50.70]But I never ended up doing it.
[55:52.33]Spoiler alert.
[55:53.67]That's a great idea.
[55:54.35]I should do it still.
[55:56.01]Jeremy, is there any video that you wish you could make that you just haven't done?
[56:00.54]You want to make it, but if you actually put it on the internet, it would be kind of iffy.
[56:04.23]Oh, yeah.
[56:05.23]All the time.
[56:06.29]So just straight up like...
[56:07.71]Probably, like, once a week.
[56:09.37]Do we get to hear about them?
[56:10.79]Or... Is it, like, not safe for work or what?
[56:13.58]Well, no, no, no.
[56:14.70]Some of them might still be made.
[56:16.70]Oh, oh, okay.
[56:17.99]So, like, a sneak preview.
[56:20.01]Hey, Jerma knows that, personally, that's every video ever that I've not made.
[56:25.38]I'm on, like, a six-month streak of really well not made videos.
[56:30.57]Like 15 second clips that aren't long enough for an actual video.
[56:35.64]Just really good ideas that for some reason or another... There's one in particular, I will say this, a video that's going to be made.
[56:44.49]I'm going to blow my life savings making it.
[56:49.05]It's going to be my magnum opus.
[56:51.04]I'll never be able to make another video again after I finish this video.
[56:56.46]I'm sorry, can someone just tell me where Banny is right now?
[57:00.81]I feel like no one told him he's on the stand but I think it's working really we have to hear about this video it's going to be a little bit and I don't think that I think we're going to have a little bit you know that that is a tap into my son's college fund like he'll understand something
[57:23.39]Dude, I know what the video is, and he will not understand.
[57:27.14]He'll watch the video.
[57:29.36]I think the people deserve to know this video.
[57:32.14]Or at least a teaser.
[57:33.27]Yeah, we need like a sneak preview.
[57:35.15]Sneak preview.
[57:35.81]The wind will be drawn out of its sails.
[57:38.73]This boat's got to sail.
[57:40.94]But you have to tell us.
[57:42.16]For the kids.
[57:42.80]For the kids, you have to tell us.
[57:45.30]Yeah, the kids will be sad.
[57:46.42]Don't fall for trickery.
[57:47.65]I just pulled it out.
[57:48.83]I just pulled it out.
[57:50.59]Yep.
[57:51.13]Wait, did you just already tell her?
[57:52.07]Come find me.
[57:53.29]Did you tell him?
[57:54.78]What?
[57:54.90]No.
[57:55.48]You told him the secret?
[57:56.72]Yeah, he told me.
[57:57.60]You told him the secret video?
[57:59.56]Mm-hmm.
[57:59.72]That's supposed to be a secret video.
[58:02.21]Oh, boy.
[58:05.95]Oh, I really... You know what?
[58:07.48]I can't say what it is because in the... Am I going the wrong way?
[58:13.46]Yes.
[58:13.74]I'm going to turn around and walk in the other direction.
[58:18.65]If I say what it is...
[58:20.29]Then the off chance that this doesn't get made, then I just said a video that is never going to happen.
[58:28.43]I'm like, everyone is so pumped up for this video.
[58:31.02]I'm pretty pumped up for it and I don't even know what it is.
[58:33.38]And the money that you spent on it already, you know?
[58:36.16]No, no.
[58:38.54]It's got to be secret.
[58:39.34]It's got to stay secret.
[58:40.42]Alright.
[58:40.92]Alright.
[58:41.23]Fair enough.
[58:41.75]You know what's really funny, actually, is that people won't think of YouTubers for TF2.
[58:44.41]They think, you know, they think Star, they think Jerma, they think, you know, Tag and Manny and everyone else we have here.
[58:48.84]But a secret YouTuber in the midst of us is Truck Truck, who actually has 3.5 million views on one of his YouTube videos.
[58:56.17]Do you want to tell us more about that?
[58:57.69]I believe it's a Minecraft video?
[58:59.61]Yeah, I made a Minecraft video.
[59:03.35]I played Minecraft for two weeks and I made a video.
[59:06.84]Minecraft on YouTube.
[59:08.36]That's all you have to say.
[59:10.74]Anyone out there knows, yeah.
[59:13.64]My boy Boots.
[59:16.15]I built a water slide in two weeks.
[59:18.47]And then I never played the game again.
[59:20.19]Very nice water slide.
[59:23.01]Well, hey, there you go.
[59:25.53]He's giving me the look right now.
[59:26.55]He's like, didn't want people to know about this video that he made.
[59:29.62]I changed my name on YouTube.
[59:32.78]What was it, a Minecraft guy?
[59:34.94]It's so amazing, yeah.
[59:35.64]It's like, truck, truck, Minecraft.
[59:37.15]A Minecraft YouTuber in our midst.
[59:37.93]No, you won't be able to find it.
[59:40.07]Well, through my name.
[59:41.91]Really?
[59:42.13]The account name is just, like, LOL.
[59:44.95]When did you do this?
[59:46.50]Like, when Minecraft was in alpha, like, a long time ago.
[59:49.52]That's funny.
[59:51.82]Did you do the creeper?
[59:53.60]Yeah, well, this...

[61:37.43]Count Chocula?
[61:38.61]No, no, no, no, no.
[61:39.41]In a microwave.
[61:40.27]Count Chocula is chocolate.
[61:41.53]Yeah, I don't think there's marshmallows in there.
[61:43.09]Yeah, what are you even talking about?
[61:44.72]Oh, is that Cocoa Puffs?
[61:45.72]Cocoa Puffs do not have marshmallows.
[61:47.54]Yeah, Cocoa Puffs.
[61:48.18]For sure.
[61:48.58]It's got to be, you've got to get chocolate milk only.
[61:51.12]The market is already saturated, dude.
[61:54.33]Oh, yeah?
[61:54.73]Well, see me in 10 years when I have a Fortune 500 company.
[61:58.69]You can use that money to bankroll your YouTube videos.
[62:01.22]Fortune 500 marshmallow-based company.
[62:03.12]Your high production value YouTube videos.
[62:05.10]Wow.
[62:08.25]Any other good comments?
[62:09.55]Yeah.
[62:12.04]$50 from an anonymous person who wants Jerma to sing the Pirate Shwe song.
[62:19.36]The Shwee song.
[62:21.42]Can you sing us that song?
[62:23.17]Please.
[62:24.17]It's not really a song you sing.
[62:26.55]It's $50.
[62:27.69]Are there any lyrics for that song?
[62:32.96]There are lyrics to that song.
[62:35.54]I still think it needs to happen.
[62:37.08]You need to find a way.
[62:37.99]I'm very good at this game, Kurt.
[62:41.15]That's all you're going to do?
[62:42.23]That's all it is?
[62:43.29]I was looking at the couch like, who was saying that?
[62:53.13]That was amazing.
[62:54.67]Grant, I swear to God.
[62:56.15]Grant!
[62:57.73]I got stuck in the door and you took advantage of it.
[63:00.26]I liberated you.
[63:00.98]Oh my God.
[63:01.92]America.
[63:03.42]But yeah, speaking of donations, Seabear, that donation track on the top left, I've been watching it.
[63:06.91]It's been going off the whole time.
[63:09.49]Yep.
[63:09.87]Non-stop.
[63:10.43]This is amazing.
[63:11.71]Yeah.
[63:11.79]There's a lot of good comments, too.
[63:13.14]There's a lot of troll comments, I've got to say.
[63:15.24]Who's surprised?
[63:16.24]Mostly about Star and Jerma and things that they want to do to either one of them or that they want to see them do to each other.
[63:22.73]I think that covers all of the bases.
[63:25.21]Yeah.
[63:25.51]If anyone else has seen the donation tracker, it's hard not to laugh.
[63:29.56]So I'm reading it.
[63:30.08]It's like that's beyond X-rated.
[63:34.40]Thank you for your $25.
[63:37.09]We'll take the money.
[63:38.07]Thanks for the imagery.
[63:42.32]Dermot's having so much fun.
[63:44.17]Did you hear what he said?
[63:45.55]No.
[63:46.80]Did you hear what Star said?
[63:48.30]No.
[63:49.11]I'm glad.
[63:51.25]What did he say?
[63:54.86]That was really, really... That was not safe for work.
[63:59.97]We're also getting a lot of... Here is some money from part of the world that they live in.
[64:05.37]South America, Czech Republic.
[64:07.26]It's really cool.
[64:07.92]So if you're donating from a different country, tell us where you're from.
[64:12.00]Touch every country in the world.
[64:14.64]We need a map and we can put the pins when we get a donation from every country up there.
[64:18.77]Yeah.
[64:19.63]I was going to say we could put it right there, but we can't replace the TF2 quilt.
[64:23.50]Yeah.
[64:24.00]This is up for raffle, though.
[64:25.32]The quilt behind me is up for raffle.
[64:27.45]That's so cool.
[64:28.13]You said someone's mom knitted it?
[64:30.83]Yes.
[64:31.77]Enryu's mother.
[64:33.48]That's really cool.
[64:34.16]Shout out to her.
[64:34.86]Enryu, who will be in the MVM.
[64:36.98]Heck yeah, that's tonight.
[64:38.48]I think it's kind of a shame because actually the reverse side of that quilt is the coolest side, I think.
[64:42.43]It's got all the classes on it.
[64:43.87]Maybe tomorrow we'll flip it.
[64:45.43]The other side.
[64:46.33]We'll do a 180.
[64:47.70]Like a reveal?
[64:48.74]Yeah.
[64:49.16]Big reveal tomorrow on the other side of the quilt.
[64:52.10]Like seeing the dark side of the moon.
[64:53.21]You never get to see it.
[64:53.99]It's all back over there.
[64:56.17]I tried.
[64:58.80]Has anyone seen these plushies, by the way?
[65:00.06]I don't know if you saw these.
[65:01.02]I saw it when I was watching Sal in Admiral Castle.
[65:03.73]I think that one's taped down.
[65:05.07]Oh, is it?
[65:06.07]Yeah.
[65:06.91]Okay, they're really cool.
[65:08.10]They are really cool, though.
[65:09.48]What's the bug thing?
[65:11.48]It's a spy crab.
[65:13.81]It's the spy crab.
[65:15.37]Wait, this one's not taped down.
[65:17.09]We have the spy crab here.
[65:18.72]Okay.
[65:19.84]That is cute.
[65:20.64]That is cute.
[65:21.44]My dog would obliterate that thing.
[65:22.87]It actually has a code on it.
[65:24.35]And you can get a spy crab in-game.
[65:25.75]Oh, really?
[65:26.57]Yeah, yeah.
[65:27.43]That's really, really cool.
[65:28.85]I like it.
[65:29.84]Yeah, the dispenser one is really cute, man.
[65:32.08]I love the dispenser.
[65:32.94]I'm going to buy it after this event.
[65:37.05]Yeah?
[65:42.01]Steer!
[65:42.15]I hope that was on three.
[65:43.46]Otherwise, there's no contact.
[65:46.74]Steer!
[65:47.46]Steer!
[65:49.86]If I get in the tip of the hat, that's what I'm going to say in chat.
[65:52.52]Dude, it looked like your character said it on my screen.
[65:58.75]Nice.
[65:59.89]Alright.
[66:00.17]So I'm not sure when exactly the MGE incentive is ending, but it might be in eight minutes.
[66:06.78]So the goal is $2,500 to The Floor is Lava replay the final round, which I think would be funny, especially if Banny's in it.
[66:16.63]Dang.
[66:17.47]And how far are we?
[66:19.29]I think we are 20.
[66:20.77]Well, I'm getting the messages from the people in the back.
[66:23.68]I don't actually have that here, but they said the goal is $2,500.
[66:26.78]So when you're donating, you can click that down on the little menu if you want to see that.
[66:31.09]I think you should because that's really funny, and we could laugh at them from here.
[66:34.01]Can we get an update on how far we are on the $2,500?
[66:36.64]I think we probably can.
[66:37.88]Okay, maybe we'll update you guys in a couple minutes on that.
[66:39.74]We need a status report from the home base.
[66:41.08]Yeah, status report from the front desk.
[66:43.19]Yeah, I've seen people actually donate multiple times.
[66:45.83]I just saw Agro's name pop up there from Critscast, and he's donated multiple times already.
[66:50.38]Thank you.
[66:50.84]Ready to be shock jocked?
[66:52.66]Tag.
[66:53.54]Oh, my God.
[66:56.52]You have to get him to say it.
[66:58.41]Killed the streamer.
[67:00.21]You got to get him to say the correct term to get the shock jock.
[67:04.69]Alright, tell us how the proper shock jocking is, Jerma.
[67:07.69]Give me the shock jock, shock jock, give me the jock jock me.
[67:11.09]The jock jock?
[67:15.24]It's got to be correct.
[67:17.06]Alright, you should play soldier and someone should heal you and you should command them with the shock jock.
[67:21.77]Who's going to shock jock me?
[67:25.25]I will shock jock you.
[67:26.39]Alright, somebody's got to give me the shock jock.
[67:28.01]I'll do anything to you.
[67:29.74]Give me the jock jock, shock jock me.
[67:33.78]What?
[67:35.16]I'm speechless.
[67:36.08]You'll do anything to me?
[67:37.66]Is that what you said?
[67:38.69]Let's reiterate that one more time.
[67:40.67]Can we play?
[67:41.55]Everybody write that one down, what he just said.
[67:44.23]Look, we're going to go super duper fast.
[67:46.52]We kind of do.
[67:47.20]Oh my god.
[67:49.26]I thought that was you blowing up.
[67:50.68]Get over here.
[67:51.27]I'm trying to make us run.
[67:52.31]You're striking away from me.
[67:57.74]You wouldn't understand.
[67:59.24]I'm going to go mail instead.
[68:01.99]I'm still waiting for how close we are.
[68:06.82]There is Chipotle being eaten out there.
[68:09.02]Things are being done.
[68:12.45]Yeah, I ordered a quesadilla, but they gave it to me in a taco shell and not the big tortilla shell.
[68:19.44]Tag ordered the kid's meal.
[68:21.99]We're the kids.
[68:26.71]So we're all ordering bowls and burritos.
[68:29.52]The YouTube thing doesn't work out.
[68:35.89]You could have a career as an auctioneer or something.
[68:38.57]Yeah, you're pretty good.
[68:39.69]Ladies and gentlemen, that's how you shock somebody's jock.
[68:44.08]You saw it here first.
[68:46.52]Keep the heels up, keep the...
[68:52.47]It's like a door opening.
[68:58.24]We do have some donations coming in.
[69:00.08]$100 from, again, anonymous.
[69:01.84]So $100 if you want your praise.
[69:04.24]You're going to have to give me a name.
[69:06.26]Great thing you guys are doing.
[69:07.21]Watched all the other ones on YouTube.
[69:08.71]First one I'm finally actually around for.
[69:11.49]Thank you, guys.
[69:12.23]Well, thank you for the $100.
[69:14.07]It's really kind.
[69:15.55]Very generous.
[69:16.39]$3 donation from Beat Hazard.
[69:21.18]Star, comma, Jerma, comma.
[69:23.06]Of the two of you, who do you think the better TF2 player is?
[69:26.76]Ooh.
[69:27.36]That's the easiest question I could answer.
[69:30.43]Didn't we solve this last year?
[69:34.78]What's the answer?
[69:36.18]Him.
[69:37.34]He's just being modest, I think.
[69:40.54]They MGE'd last tip of the hat, remember?
[69:44.45]I don't want to remember.
[69:46.49]No one wants to remember.
[69:49.86]I would consider my skills to be
[69:54.08]You know, extremely high.
[69:58.82]Who's a better dancer?
[70:01.26]Without me?
[70:01.81]Are you kidding?
[70:03.65]I'm such a better actor than you are.
[70:05.99]I'm such a better dancer than you.
[70:07.93]YouTube dancer?
[70:09.35]Like TF2 dancer or like in real life dancer?
[70:12.02]I want to see a little dance off of TF2.
[70:14.64]What's a TF2?
[70:15.56]I don't know.
[70:16.22]Like a taunt?
[70:17.04]I'm not sure.
[70:18.08]Let's see what they come up with.
[70:19.71]After having both jock-shocked Jerma and Tag, I can say Jerma is at least better than Tag.
[70:24.87]Wow.
[70:25.55]Wait, you just gave me crits when I had two things loaded.
[70:28.18]See you later, Banny.
[70:31.02]I can just sense when I'm around.
[70:38.07]You like that call out?
[70:39.96]I'm unstoppable.
[70:40.82]I like that 50% over.
[70:41.48]Oh, that's a dead scout.
[70:43.99]This might be my favorite.
[70:45.27]Is that a seagull?
[70:46.31]Okay, $25 donation from Polecat, who says, I moved to Boston to find Ster and Jerma.
[70:53.22]It's been three years, and I still haven't found them.
[70:55.54]Nice city, though.
[70:57.68]What?
[70:58.73]No, no, no, I don't.
[71:01.77]I don't.
[71:02.93]Hold on to it.
[71:05.85]Keep at it.
[71:07.09]Molly, you're from Boston.
[71:07.87]Don't do it.
[71:08.19]Don't do it.
[71:09.23]Please don't do it.
[71:09.63]He did it.
[71:10.37]Yeah, he did it.
[71:11.41]I know.
[71:11.82]And it blew everything.
[71:13.02]He blew it.
[71:13.62]Same city as Star and Dermot.
[71:14.82]No, I haven't found them yet.
[71:15.74]I keep looking, but I can't seem to find them.
[71:18.17]Don't ever do that again unless I say give me the jock jock.
[71:20.31]You're still better than Tag.
[71:22.07]Are you serious?
[71:23.94]Okay, so I did get word from WhiskerBiscuit, who says that we are about 1,000 out of 2,500.
[71:30.64]I'm not exactly sure when it is going to end, if it's at the start of the MGE block, which is right after this in three minutes, which means we're probably wrapping up the pub thing in a few minutes.
[71:43.31]I'm going to cap that card then, because they're up.
[71:45.03]There it is.
[71:46.04]Boom, right on time.
[71:46.78]Hey, that's great.
[71:48.06]So I'm guessing we're probably going to cut to setting up for MGE.
[71:51.58]I'm not sure if we're ready or not in there.
[71:53.08]That was fun.
[71:53.92]I mean, so just so you guys know, everyone on stream, it says Mela at the top, but I was playing on his account.
[71:59.49]That was tagged.
[72:00.61]So that was actually me.
[72:01.35]Wow, who knew Mela was so good?
[72:02.80]I'm okay being middle of the road.
[72:06.68]Okay.
[72:07.10]That means I'm not too extreme on either side, you know?
[72:09.33]We're going to go to a little bit of a break, and then we're going to be back with the MGE block.
[72:13.27]It should be a good time.
[72:14.79]So stick with us here as we go eat Chipotle and have fun.
[72:18.32]Thank you.
[72:19.72]Moe's is way better.
