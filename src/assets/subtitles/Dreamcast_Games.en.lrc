[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.88]Why, hello there.
[00:04.30]Sorry, my mic was a little fucked up.
[00:15.73]Can you hear that?
[00:18.77]Speaking of fucked up... The internet's not having a good time right now, is it?
[00:24.93]Uh-oh.
[00:34.88]This is happening two nights ago, too, wasn't it?
[00:46.93]I can't listen to this thing.
[00:50.75]If you're wondering what that noise is, that's the Dreamcast.
[00:59.21]But I can't really do much of anything right now.
[01:05.96]Figured that we were just kind of going over a bad internet bump.
[01:12.38]But it's not the case right now.
[01:17.68]Dropped a thousand frames in the first three minutes of the stream.
[01:21.57]That's not good.
[01:28.73]We'll give it a few minutes.
[01:31.24]Otherwise, I am going to have to get off and call.
[01:35.82]Because this will be the second stream in a row.
[01:41.90]We've had about two straight good months of no internet problems, so... Hmm.
[01:48.70]Anyways, if we do get this free... The idea is... Can I like... Alright, all I have to do is cover the vent.
[01:58.06]Where the fan comes... Just cover the fan with a piece of tape.
[02:02.45]And then you can't hear it, right?
[02:07.49]I forgot how fucking loud Dreamcast is tonight.
[02:09.67]Sorry, I'm getting thrown off a little bit here.
[02:11.70]From the internet problem, but... Those of you that remember, it's a nostalgia trip tonight.
[02:22.68]I'll show you just how much of a nostalgia trip in about five seconds when you see the date that's on the screen.
[02:29.71]Set up a date and time for the Dreamcast.
[02:33.04]12, 27, 1998.
[02:33.24]2008, 2018.
[02:33.28]This is 21 years ago.
[02:34.00]What's today's date?
[02:38.18]Are you even allowed to go past the year 2000?
[02:41.14]What's the final year you're allowed to put in for Dreamcast?
[03:04.06]I guess it can go as far as you want.
[03:10.30]I wasn't even born yet?
[03:11.48]Alright, let's keep it nostalgic.
[03:16.82]No, wait, isn't that going to fuck up the internal clock or something?
[03:21.36]What if I play a game that needs the correct date?
[03:23.60]Well, that's not connected to the internet, so it doesn't matter.
[03:25.36]Alright, today is...
[03:31.14]What the hell is today?
[03:31.80]January 20... It's January 25th, 1998, and it is... Is this a 24-hour clock?
[03:36.61]It is.
[03:37.73]It is 3, 4, 5, 6 a.m., 7 a.m., 8 a.m., 9 a.m., 10 a.m., 11 a.m., 12 noon, 1, 2, 3, 21.
[03:40.05]Alright, that looks good.
[04:01.97]Here it comes, here it comes, here it comes!
[04:03.66]Oh no, wait, what?
[04:07.36]Where was the... the intro?
[04:13.77]Where's the TED Talk intro?
[04:18.09]I press back?
[04:23.65]I gotta restart the console.
[04:25.96]Alright, well, we're good, right?
[04:26.80]What about music?
[04:31.50]What's even on here?
[04:38.77]Oh, I gotta show this on camera too.
[04:42.01]Because... Whoa!
[05:22.94]That's me Okay, so again I gotta be careful here Because that is
[05:44.68]So take a look what happens, right?
[05:47.18]It captures the last frame that you did.
[05:50.13]So I've got to remember, like... Hold on.
[06:08.11]Whatever, I don't fucking care.
[06:17.68]Alright, I should be in sync now.
[06:19.12]Whatever.
[06:19.66]I don't fucking give a shit.
[06:22.32]You think anything embarrasses me anymore?
[06:25.03]Not really.
[06:35.03]So here's the Dreamcast controller.
[06:36.81]If you don't- If you've never seen this before... I wasn't naked on camera, okay?
[06:42.73]I- Look, I was going like this.
[06:45.52]I was like this!
[06:47.92]And I leaned up and you just couldn't see, these were bunched up under my chin.
[06:54.10]Look, I didn't have a shirt on.
[06:56.75]But it was like closed up.
[06:58.29]Anyways, okay.
[07:06.47]Here's the Dreamcast controller.
[07:08.92]The interesting thing about, I can't even do like a look at welcome to the stream tutorial, look at the Dreamcast controller now.
[07:20.10]It's fine, whatever.
[07:20.94]I don't think anything fucking embarrasses me anymore.
[07:25.02]The interesting... The interesting thing about the Dreamcast controller is, if I can get it out... Shave your armpits.
[07:38.91]I will.
[07:39.21]I actually did that.
[07:41.49]My armpit hair grows exponentially!
[07:57.01]So the interesting thing about the Dreamcast is this thing comes out.
[08:03.92]Isn't that interesting, folks?
[08:05.94]This is the memory card.
[08:08.17]And the memory card is also a little screen.
[08:12.25]And you put that in here.
[08:13.51]Look, there's a slot right there.
[08:14.63]You can have two of these in there if you didn't know.
[08:16.80]Take a look at that.
[08:18.42]It snaps in.
[08:28.48]And there it is!
[08:31.83]Every game has a little screen.
[08:33.83]Every game has fucking long armpit hair.
[08:37.11]And every game, uh, turns on their webcam with a frame of them with no clothes on.
[08:41.21]So, anyways, uh, let's get started here.
[08:45.89]We have to reset it.
[08:51.51]So we can hear the TED Talk intro, and I'm gonna put in... The reason why I'm not gonna start with, uh, Tony Hawk...
[08:59.70]is because if I start with Tony Hawk 2, that's going to be the whole stream.
[09:03.58]I can't just do the whole stream as Tony Hawk.
[09:08.51]So there were a handful of other great games for the Dreamcast that are exclusive.
[09:18.51]Like, for instance, Survival Horror.
[09:21.66]There were a handful of Survival Horror games that only came out on the Dreamcast.
[09:26.80]Like The Ring, Blue Stinger, Carrier...
[09:30.64]There's at least three or four.
[09:33.80]We've also got Dynamite Cop, which is one of my favorite arcade games ever made.
[09:38.93]And we've got some other random fucked up stupid shit.
[09:43.09]So I'm going to probably have to say we're going to start with The Ring.
[09:46.89]We have to.
[09:49.17]This is The Ring, this is the game, this is what the movie was based on.
[09:56.88]I don't know why the fuck, Logitech and OBS, why did you do that?
[10:01.79]So Logitech and... Okay.
[10:10.61]Here it is.
[10:11.79]This is the Ring Terror's Realm.
[10:15.33]Exclusive to Dreamcast.
[10:16.34]Can't get it anywhere else.
[10:18.36]Let's go ahead and do this.
[10:25.36]Here it comes.
[10:25.76]Here it comes.
[10:26.18]Here it comes.
[10:29.30]Yep.
[10:31.29]It didn't even do it, why, what?
[10:39.38]Do it.
[10:44.64]Here it comes.
[10:48.53]It's not even gonna do it.
[10:52.07]Wait, I can't reset it right.
[10:53.27]Listen, this is like somebody's cutting meat at the deli.
[11:00.93]Listen to this shit.
[11:03.54]Hey, you want some salami?
[11:10.86]I'll get it for you.
[11:12.78]Is that good?
[11:13.60]Is that thickness good?
[11:14.36]Well, it's unlikely to be a homicide case.
[11:27.84]We'll get to the bottom of this.
[11:30.17]What the hell is this cutscene?
[11:31.35]I gotta move this thing down.
[11:49.01]First Dreamcast game of the night is gonna be the Ring Terrors round for the Dreamcast.
[11:53.33]That's true.
[11:54.35]I need to- this is so unbearable.
[11:56.75]I need to fucking move this down.
[11:58.99]And I can feel like a blanket on it.
[12:06.83]Hold on.
[12:09.61]I'm gonna put it down here.
[12:17.28]It's too loud.
[12:18.18]I can't even concentrate.
[12:23.74]Okay, that's better.
[12:26.35]This looks like an SNES menu.
[12:33.59]Yeah, it does.
[12:34.47]Alright, let's get started.
[12:37.23]This is The Ring.
[12:37.97]1991.
[12:38.39]New game.
[12:39.03]Low game.
[12:39.81]Options.
[12:47.60]Nickelodeon presents The Ring Terror's Realm!
[12:52.14]Okay.
[12:58.28]Uh, I'm just gonna play, I think.
[13:07.21]Hello?
[13:08.21]Meg?
[13:08.89]Robert!
[13:09.55]Get the job?
[13:10.56]Yeah, I'll be working with you starting tomorrow, so I guess I'll be seeing you soon.
[13:13.69]Really?
[13:13.99]That's great.
[13:14.91]So why don't we go out for a celebratory drink?
[13:17.13]Okay.
[13:18.39]I'll get ready.
[13:18.89]Promise?
[13:19.39]Promise.
[13:20.21]Bye for now.
[13:23.61]Is he gonna watch the ring video?
[13:27.06]She isn't any idea of how important this project is.
[13:33.34]But it's not a goal.
[13:49.56]What's happening?
[13:54.62]Oh, Robert.
[13:55.93]He didn't sound so pleased, even though it's been quite a while since we spoke.
[13:59.87]He's absolutely Mr. Thickhead.
[14:01.71]Easy!
[14:02.09]What the fuck was that?
[14:04.27]Well, today's the day.
[14:05.41]He has to make up for it.
[14:09.50]You don't go out of a garage like that.
[14:11.62]You've got to slow down.
[14:12.52]It's a new Resident Evil 2.
[14:14.70]This is a GTA driver.
[14:15.36]Why is it so dark?
[14:15.88]Yeah.
[14:38.72]Robert?
[14:39.84]Yeah, I think we're just gonna have to do it that way.
[14:41.86]And that's just a... Hey!
[14:43.88]Hey, miss.
[14:44.70]No, I'm sorry, you can't come in here.
[14:45.66]You're gonna have to get out of here.
[14:48.60]Or do you live here?
[14:49.26]What's happened, officer?
[14:50.68]What's happened, officer?
[14:52.84]I'm asking you a question.
[14:54.18]Do you live here?
[14:55.06]Hello?
[14:56.18]Miss?
[14:59.20]What the fuck?
[15:01.80]Hey.
[15:02.60]Hey, stop, lady.
[15:07.53]That punch sound.
[15:09.79]They only had like four punch sound effects.
[15:13.75]I got hit sound.
[15:16.44]Okay, this is way- I need to increase the brightness or something.
[15:22.74]Meg!
[15:23.16]Meg!
[15:23.72]What's going on over there?
[15:26.82]Like, hey ma'am, what's happening here?
[15:28.91]Hold on a moment, sir.
[15:30.07]I know the two of them.
[15:30.99]They're friends.
[15:32.43]What happened?
[15:33.71]I don't believe this.
[15:34.69]I see him.
[15:36.62]Oh, Meg!
[15:37.32]Could you explain your relationship to either her or the victim?
[15:40.92]This is like a bunch of YouTubers made this or something.
[15:45.45]I'm Jack, and this is Robert's girlfriend, Meg.
[15:49.19]Oh, I see.
[15:49.67]Well, I'm sorry to... What happened to Robert?
[15:53.23]Actually, we don't yet exactly know what happened to him this evening.
[15:59.57]You don't know?
[16:00.93]Isn't this a murder?
[16:02.91]It's unlikely to be a homicide case.
[16:06.31]I'm still alive.
[16:06.93]Don't worry.
[16:07.44]Beeeeee!
[16:35.46]I can't help it.
[16:36.46]The Dreamcast is so loud.
[16:41.37]Hold on, wait.
[16:41.85]Wait, wait a minute.
[16:43.29]Wait, let me tell you what it's worth.
[16:46.23]Okay.
[17:39.26]My left ear?
[17:40.54]What happened to the left ear?
[17:43.28]I don't think I can fix this.
[18:11.43]Well, this is my room starting today.
[18:12.59]It's a weird feeling.
[18:17.89]When do I get to control the game?
[18:26.60]Robert.
[18:31.82]No good comes from me moping around all the time.
[18:34.70]I have to do my best.
[18:35.60]Is this the same lady in the cutscene that we just watched?
[18:44.89]Okay, I'm walking now.
[18:46.09]It's tank controls, which that's fucking fantastic.
[18:53.00]What the fuck?
[18:53.68]Oh, that's sprint.
[18:56.70]Is it though?
[18:57.68]How did I just do that?
[18:58.52]I have no idea how I'm doing that.
[19:04.76]Is it reverse tank?
[19:06.24]How do I get out of the door?
[19:07.20]Okay, the phone's ringing.
[19:20.39]Hello.
[19:21.25]Meg, it's Jack.
[19:21.95]Are you settled in?
[19:23.45]Yes, today's my first day.
[19:25.57]I'm so sorry to make you worry so much.
[19:28.02]Don't worry about it.
[19:29.78]I know you're going through tough times, and I'm like this.
[19:33.80]No.
[19:34.76]At times like this, it's easier to be worried about others.
[19:37.24]I'm reading this so wrong.
[19:39.78]Oh yeah, by the way, did you look at Robert's computer?
[19:44.23]Computer?
[19:45.49]I see his laptop here.
[19:46.45]Is something the matter with it?
[19:48.55]No, actually, I heard a slightly strange story.
[19:52.07]A strange story?
[19:52.93]Yeah, about a CQC lab.
[19:58.18]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[19:59.60]Died at the same time in the same way at Robert.
[20:04.46]Same time in the same way.
[20:05.64]I don't think it's a coincidence.
[20:06.90]I've never seen anyone die like that.
[20:11.93]You're right, but what does that have to do with the computer?
[20:15.24]Yeah, about the computer.
[20:16.74]Both of them were found dead in front of their computer.
[20:19.34]Jack, now isn't that a coincidence?
[20:22.22]No, I have more.
[20:23.10]Robert and both lab workers running a program called Ring on their computers.
[20:28.28]Ring?
[20:33.42]Yeah, Ring.
[20:34.46]The police thought it was suspicious.
[20:37.36]They tried to analyze it, but no matter what they did, it wouldn't boot.
[20:42.10]The program wouldn't boot?
[20:44.12]Yeah, apparently.
[20:44.80]This is just two AI talking to each other.
[20:47.38]This is just learning English.
[20:50.48]Take this text right here and add the learning English YouTube video bullshit on here.
[20:56.82]Yeah, apparently.
[20:58.72]In any case, I'll check up on the details about it now.
[21:02.35]But until then, I think it's better if you didn't touch the computer.
[21:05.37]Don't touch the computer!
[21:07.37]But it doesn't boot, right?
[21:08.75]Besides, Jack...
[21:10.90]Are you saying that Robert died thanks to a computer program?
[21:14.98]You know, I am a scientist.
[21:16.80]I would rather understand... I would understand if it was a virus in CQC, but from a computer... I know, but I have a bad feeling about this.
[21:32.03]You're a worrywart.
[21:33.21]I'll be fine.
[21:36.51]In any case, I'll call you again when I find something out.
[21:40.68]Thanks.
[21:41.10]Now, I'm taking over Robert's job starting today.
[21:45.32]That's good.
[21:45.70]I'm sure Robert's happy about that.
[21:46.98]I don't think Robert's happy about being dead.
[21:51.73]Why would you be happy about this?
[21:54.93]Thanks for everything, Jack.
[21:57.23]Yeah, I'll call you again.
[21:58.07]She's talking to the fax machine.
[21:59.65]Alright, bye.
[22:00.11]That's not the phone.
[22:00.79]That's a calculator.
[22:10.20]Okay, that was, let's go.
[22:12.06]I gotta examine Robert's computer, right?
[22:16.54]Am I about to watch the Ring video?
[22:20.27]Ring, a killer computer program.
[22:21.73]This is silly.
[22:22.29]This is what the movie was based on.
[22:24.85]This is it.
[22:27.01]Don't watch this!
[22:27.61]Don't!
[22:27.79]I don't want to watch this!
[22:32.09]Meg.
[22:33.89]Uh, by the way, guys, everybody that's watching right now, I'm really sorry, but seven days from now...
[22:40.93]I don't think we're gonna be around.
[22:42.09]The reason why Wobbert died might be hidden inside this.
[22:45.29]I'm gonna try.
[22:47.29]Here she go.
[22:47.71]Uh-oh.
[22:50.54]We're all gonna get ringed.
[22:56.72]Here it comes.
[23:03.34]This is the ring video.
[23:06.40]It's people in ice cubes.
[23:18.34]Wait, why are we in here?
[23:20.72]This is the Ring video?
[23:23.82]I booted up a program called Ring on the computer.
[23:34.57]Anyway, I should investigate.
[23:41.01]What are you doing?
[23:45.77]What I'm doing, booting up this computer.
[23:48.76]What are you saying?
[23:49.62]Well, in the situation we're in, I can understand you're getting confused.
[23:52.68]This situation making me wear this and all.
[23:54.56]Where in the world is this?
[23:57.10]This place?
[23:57.62]This is our battlefield against them.
[24:01.62]Them.
[24:04.24]What are you saying?
[24:05.12]Oh, I'm in the computer game.
[24:07.38]We have no time for this.
[24:08.18]One of them has snuck in here.
[24:10.32]I'll check the first floor.
[24:11.08]You go check the second.
[24:13.09]Check the second floor?
[24:14.91]Enough of this already.
[24:16.25]Is that gun you're holding a fake?
[24:17.79]Quit yakking and go kill them off.
[24:19.89]If you're too slow, they'll get us.
[24:21.68]Kill them?
[24:22.82]But you're the one that made me hold this gun.
[24:25.18]There's no way I can use it without learning how.
[24:27.44]I'm appalled that someone would stand here without knowing how to use a gun.
[24:30.16]Are you with the informants?
[24:32.78]This is just learning English.
[24:33.78]Here's a quick rundown.
[24:36.28]Keep your ears open.
[24:39.21]First, try pushing left trigger.
[24:41.03]That turns the flashlight on.
[24:45.03]You can move it with just complete darkness there for a second, okay.
[24:50.91]If you keep the flashlight on, they'll find you immediately.
[24:54.44]So be careful, now try pushing the right trigger.
[24:59.82]Now shoot me!
[25:06.78]That's your aim.
[25:07.46]The gun automatically targets within 45 degrees in front of you.
[25:11.90]But it only targets when the flashlight shines.
[25:15.27]The gun shoots if you push the A button while aiming.
[25:19.05]Try aiming and firing.
[25:27.31]Oh boy, this is gonna be bad.
[25:31.26]Yeah, that's it!
[25:32.62]That gun has a laser sight, so it should be easy to tell where you're aiming.
[25:35.44]Be careful, some weapons don't have sights.
[25:38.02]Next, equipping weapons.
[25:38.78]The status screen appears when you push... What does this have to do with the ring?
[25:44.97]Somebody came up with an idea for The Ring, for a video game, and then they realized that, what are you supposed to do?
[25:52.89]Besides watch the movie and die.
[25:55.96]So they put you inside of a computer program, which is like an FPS shooter game.
[26:01.40]And this is us watching it, I guess.
[26:03.50]I have no idea.
[26:13.14]This is Resident Evil.
[26:14.16]They were like, yeah, I guess just make Resident Evil again, somehow.
[26:19.17]Item.
[26:20.49]Handgun and a knife.
[26:22.71]And we are fine.
[26:24.59]Everything is just fine.
[26:26.69]S item.
[26:31.45]Still dropping frames.
[26:32.36]This is kind of consistently sort of awful.
[26:38.22]It's okay, but not good.
[26:40.30]Oh, you have to hold it.
[27:07.20]Those are the basic controls of the game.
[27:08.96]Anything else you need to learn on your own, do you want me to go over there?
[27:11.64]No, don't go over that again.
[27:13.92]Go check out the second floor.
[27:14.88]Be very careful. ...
[27:33.38]Okay.
[27:36.42]What is this?
[27:37.26]How do I pick stuff up?
[27:39.85]You found the healing jelly.
[27:41.13]Pick it up.
[27:41.53]Yes.
[27:42.35]Why would you ever play this game?
[27:46.19]Is there a speedrun with this game with all, um... All of the lights turned off?
[27:58.84]I can't use the analog either.
[28:00.42]And there's no fun Dreamcast thing in the middle.
[28:05.38]How do I walk up the fucking stairs?
[28:09.73]Oh.
[28:10.91]I forgot, it's an old game, you have to actually load.
[28:12.67]It's too dark!
[28:35.01]Give me the healing jelly.
[28:41.29]The perspective is actually kind of scary.
[28:45.14]Although, it's hard to even determine where the hell my character is in these hallways.
[28:49.76]I'm gonna get jumped out.
[28:51.94]What was that?
[28:53.46]Oh.
[28:53.86]It's a flashlight in the screen, I guess.
[29:03.15]What is this?
[29:03.53]There aren't any enemies here.
[29:04.87]This is stupid.
[29:12.93]That's the enemy!
[29:13.75]He wants me to kill that?
[29:14.69]He's reckless!
[29:16.63]I have to do it, I guess.
[29:17.67]Alright.
[29:32.07]They put bullets over here.
[29:38.91]It's like a book, or a briefcase, or bullets.
[29:41.01]What is it?
[29:41.97]Handgun bullets, okay.
[29:48.73]More handgun bullets, good.
[29:51.71]Next?
[29:52.19]Hold on, not yet.
[29:57.74]Not quite.
[30:05.89]We have to get past the first tutorial area.
[30:11.01]So did I do it?
[30:11.73]Is that the only thing he wanted me to do?
[30:15.89]At least give me seven minutes in this game.
[30:17.77]Or seven... Well, it was seven days.
[30:19.35]Never mind.
[30:19.71]That would be a bad idea.
[30:31.47]I hate tank control so much.
[30:40.31]Here's your five second loop of the same song.
[30:44.49]I defeated the upstairs enemy, but now how do I... What?
[30:48.31]My body.
[30:49.77]I feel... I'm getting... I'm pulling out is what's happening.
[31:11.60]So now I die in seven days because I watched the shitty Resident Evil game.
[31:27.51]That was the ring.
[31:28.21]Uh-oh, I passed out.
[31:31.11]This program, what was that about?
[31:32.67]Ring, it's just a game.
[31:36.13]Really, Jack should hold off with his jokes once in a while.
[31:41.78]Jack?
[31:42.12]Sheesh, I have no... I have to give him a piece of my mind.
[31:44.56]Hello?
[31:52.18]Oh, here it is.
[31:52.68]Oh, yeah.
[31:54.16]Seven days.
[31:55.02]Here it comes.
[31:58.12]Seven.
[32:00.30]Dead.
[32:01.56]Oh.
[32:03.28]Seven more days.
[32:04.15]Seven.
[32:04.55]Only seven days.
[32:11.45]Power outage, a crank call, and a weird program.
[32:15.53]Seven more days?
[32:16.23]I'm gonna die in seven days!
[32:17.67]You've got to be kidding!
[32:18.69]Oh, because he loaded up.
[32:23.08]Fucking Doom 2.
[32:25.98]What's in here?
[32:37.51]There's an item box here.
[32:38.61]Open the box.
[32:45.27]Nothing in here.
[32:58.04]Healing jelly in the office.
[33:02.24]Nothing of interest here.
[33:03.50]Nothing in the sink.
[33:04.22]Can I leave?
[33:05.52]Where can I even go?
[33:15.94]Uh-oh.
[33:17.80]It's Chris.
[33:19.68]Excuse me, my name is Chris.
[33:21.24]Are you Meg?
[33:22.22]Hello, Chris.
[33:23.08]I'm Meg.
[33:23.92]Meg Rainman.
[33:25.42]It is a pleasure to meet you.
[33:28.30]You don't have to be so formal.
[33:29.46]My pleasure to meet you.
[33:31.59]I know it's sudden, but the Chief is asking for you.
[33:33.75]I'll guide you to the Chief's office if that's...
[33:40.43]I can't take that.
[33:41.13]I can't.
[33:41.77]Sorry.
[33:42.71]It's fine with me.
[33:44.71]Hehe, you're acting so formal.
[33:46.13]Well, then this way.
[33:52.67]It really is.
[33:53.18]Is this Chris?
[33:55.02]Meg.
[33:56.66]If the boss's name is Peter, and there's a Lois involved too, then we've got the whole family.
[34:04.42]Or Brian.
[34:07.97]Chris Meg.
[34:10.39]Please tell me this guy's name is Brian.
[34:13.07]Or Peter.
[34:14.45]Nice to meet you, Chief.
[34:15.51]I'm Meg Rainman.
[34:16.63]Sorry I was late.
[34:17.61]I'm at your services starting today.
[34:21.92]Chief Brian.
[34:23.28]What's his name?
[34:23.84]Thanks for coming.
[34:24.78]I'm looking forward to your work.
[34:26.98]I'm sorry we caused you so much trouble with this case.
[34:30.40]What are you saying?
[34:31.38]We were the ones who were serviced.
[34:34.14]By Robert.
[34:35.00]It was a shame to end up that way.
[34:38.65]We have to work hard now to make up for our loss of Robert.
[34:44.56]Yes, I think so too.
[34:46.34]By the way, about Robert.
[34:48.46]You heard that three lab members including him passed away?
[34:52.52]Yes, I heard that they all passed away at the same exact time.
[34:58.58]That's right.
[34:59.88]For such an accident, there is a high chance that it was a virus.
[35:03.66]I assume so.
[35:04.32]This is the CDC, after all.
[35:07.46]Yes, this is the best facility against disease for the public.
[35:10.60]No for the world.
[35:11.50]I don't even know what he said.
[35:13.54]We are investigating on our own, but cannot figure out the cause of death.
[35:18.34]However, the executives are fretful.
[35:20.01]They want to make an explanation as soon as possible.
[35:22.29]I can't.
[35:22.71]I have to turn the music off.
[35:24.57]Just now, an evacuation order has been issued.
[35:26.33]They're shutting this lab down.
[35:28.63]They've prohibited us from leaving the facility.
[35:33.50]It's speech jamming.
[35:35.65]Prohibit us from leaving?
[35:36.75]That means... Well, you could say we have been quarantined.
[35:41.95]Impossible!
[35:43.39]I'm so sorry about this happening on your birthday.
[35:45.87]But it's not that unusual for this stuff.
[35:47.71]Well, the evacuation order for the whole town is.
[35:50.17]Rest assured, it will only be for two, three days.
[35:54.05]Alright, I understand.
[35:55.91]Fortunately, you are free to roam in the facility.
[35:57.83]Have a look around the place.
[36:00.31]Right now, we're checking for virus leakage from the basement.
[36:04.05]You know, just like my water cooler broke.
[36:07.96]Look at my virus leakage.
[36:09.32]I'm gonna call, like, an HVAC guy.
[36:16.09]Alright.
[36:17.31]Then, Chris.
[36:18.45]Yes?
[36:24.97]Mute the music.
[36:25.79]I can't.
[36:27.05]This card will be your key and your identification within the facilities.
[36:30.28]Make sure you don't lose it.
[36:31.88]Yes, I will be careful.
[36:33.02]Then go look around.
[36:34.66]Excuse me.
[36:58.67]There is no... I can't do it.
[37:07.80]There is no muting the music, guys.
[37:10.64]It's here forever.
[37:13.02]Doesn't open.
[37:13.55]The reference room, it doesn't open without a key.
[37:25.37]Alright, let's go to the kitchen.
[37:27.43]I like the music.
[37:28.07]Can I use the fire extinguisher?
[37:44.84]You know, it's funny because I'm just like in poker, right?
[37:50.03]I got a deck of cards, and I got a hand.
[37:52.51]I got a good hand.
[37:54.27]I'm gonna fold a couple of bad hands.
[37:56.89]Forget this reference.
[37:58.31]I can't talk with this music playing.
[38:01.20]I'm taking my headphones out to say this.
[38:05.33]So, you never want to show your hand in poker, okay?
[38:09.75]You guys don't know, right now you can see like a, this is like a 10, right?
[38:14.30]You know, I have like a Jack, I got a Queen, I got a King, and I also got an Ace.
[38:19.56]And they're the same suit, which is the Dreamcast.
[38:23.18]So don't worry.
[38:23.70]Okay, now I can fucking put my headphones on.
[38:34.60]What the fuck are you doing?
[38:38.44]Okay.
[38:40.42]Alright, here's the thing.
[38:50.95]Okay, if we go back into the game, if we have to go back into the ring video game, then I will change to the next game.
[39:02.07]But, hold on.
[39:05.44]The locker room, I see.
[39:06.26]This facility is sure well equipped.
[39:10.92]I have to kill the ring.
[39:17.46]I'm not going to complete this game.
[39:28.19]I literally had to mute the stream.
[39:30.13]Oh my god.
[39:32.44]Alright, hold on.
[39:33.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[39:34.32]I'll get us out of here.
[39:35.22]Hold on.
[39:43.39]I first need to do the Resident Evil open the door transition loading screen.
[39:48.51]Wait, this is, uh, Lukino.
[39:51.27]This is the men's locker room.
[39:53.95]Do you want anything?
[39:55.67]Sorry, I made a mistake.
[39:57.71]Okay.
[39:58.73]I'm gonna save everybody here.
[40:30.03]There.
[40:31.45]It's nice to have nobody around.
[40:36.29]No changes at all.
[40:38.56]Do I have to go back in the computer?
[40:42.14]There's nothing much here.
[40:45.10]Alright, here we go.
[40:45.86]I'm going to go back in the computer.
[40:49.56]I'm going to log back in.
[40:51.20]Nothing happened.
[40:56.09]I can still hear it.
[41:02.61]Okay, I activated it.
[41:04.39]I activated the event that I needed to activate.
[41:12.82]Phone rings.
[41:15.88]I've been walking around for a full day.
[41:18.58]I heard that there's a possibility of a virus leak from the CDC.
[41:25.29]It's the top headline on every news show.
[41:27.99]It's only a possibility.
[41:28.83]They said it wasn't too uncommon around here, so don't worry.
[41:32.71]You say it's not uncommon.
[41:34.23]Anyway, Jack, that ring you mentioned earlier, it was just a game.
[41:36.81]That program booted?
[41:40.97]I had no problems, and there can be no way that a computer program can kill someone!
[41:46.18]Nothing really happened.
[41:47.64]Nothing?
[41:48.06]You worry too much.
[41:49.22]Although, speaking of something happening, I had a prank call right afterwards.
[41:52.84]Prank call?
[41:55.92]Yes.
[41:57.42]There was a weird word on the screen.
[42:01.37]It said dead.
[42:02.08]What do you mean weird word?
[42:04.82]It said dead.
[42:06.10]I think it meant game over.
[42:08.66]That's not too funny.
[42:11.08]Anyway, did you figure anything out?
[42:14.62]Alright, well, every time somebody plays Dark Souls... That's like, that's not funny.
[42:21.41]I don't like that.
[42:22.57]That's right, apparently Robert's body was handed over to the CDC.
[42:25.89]The CDC.
[42:26.95]I wonder if it's to find out the cause of death.
[42:30.71]But now I guess I'll be able to find out directly.
[42:32.70]Thank you for your Dark Souls reference in every stream.
[42:35.48]Don't go overboard, I'll call you again if I find anything.
[42:41.64]Talk to you later.
[42:42.62]Yes.
[42:47.90]Robert.
[42:48.24]Am I gonna get another phone call?
[42:52.72]For now I should ask the chief.
[42:55.30]Oh my god.
[42:57.74]Not much longer, I promise.
[43:00.53]They were the ones that Robert's body was handed over to.
[43:02.83]I know the chief is looking out for me still.
[43:04.31]I wish he had told me about this.
[43:06.27]First thing now is to go talk to the chief.
[43:07.81]That's why I opened the door.
[43:11.98]How many redundancies are there in one video game?
[43:16.64]No, not much longer.
[43:17.44]You guys know the rules.
[43:19.94]When we do a retro game night on an old console, it's 40 minutes.
[43:26.09]We have to give it at least 30 to 40 minutes.
[43:35.59]Yeah, that's the rule!
[43:43.54]Where's the chief's office?
[43:47.78]There's no information on here.
[43:49.32]Information?
[43:50.28]What information?
[43:52.87]I don't see any information.
[43:57.41]Where's the chief's office?
[44:04.33]Yeah, you don't get a hamburger from a restaurant and take one bite and then put it down.
[44:07.93]You have to... No, it's two bites.
[44:10.53]The first bite is to go, mmm, hold on.
[44:13.51]That's alright, no?
[44:14.35]I don't know.
[44:14.75]And then the second bite is to determine if you're going to get food poisoning.
[44:17.60]Right?
[44:21.86]And the third or fourth bite is if you're going to get food poisoning but you don't care because you're hungry and you know it's going to happen anyway so you just eat the rest of the rotten turkey sandwich that was in the trash.
[44:42.07]Does anybody remember where the chief's office is?
[44:45.31]Alright, alright.
[44:46.12]It's been like 40 minutes, it has.
[44:48.06]Alright.
[44:48.44]Oh, I gotta go.
[44:59.59]I'm on the wrong floor.
[45:04.71]There.
[45:05.53]You guys are good.
[45:07.33]Oh, there's a new character introduction here.
[45:15.03]That's, okay, no, that's Peter and Megan.
[45:16.62]This is the, this is a localization joke.
[45:19.82]There's Peter.
[45:22.38]We found the localization of humor.
[45:24.58]Yep, that happened.
[45:25.48]Yes.
[45:30.71]This is somebody just, this is 1998.
[45:32.41]Okay.
[45:35.55]What happened was, the person localizing this, wherever they were, just... What was popular in the West right now?
[45:44.03]Family Guy was just barely taken off as a popular show, wasn't it?
[45:47.93]Whatever, just name them.
[45:49.44]People in the West love Family Guy, right?
[45:58.22]Hold on, wait.
[45:58.66]Family Guy came out in 1999.
[46:01.14]When did this game come out?
[46:04.45]There's no way.
[46:05.53]No, yeah, there is.
[46:06.09]Family Guy.
[46:08.07]When did the game come out, though?
[46:12.20]I don't care about this anymore.
[46:25.93]I'm looking at the front.
[46:27.01]Okay.
[46:28.41]This came out.
[46:29.61]The copyright on the disk is $2,000.
[46:34.64]So not 1998, 2000.
[46:35.60]When did the first episode of Family Guy air?
[46:48.21]1999.
[46:48.63]So yeah, it had to be.
[46:49.57]Alright, let's move on.
[46:51.43]So that was a survival horror.
[46:52.71]That was the Ring, Terra's Realm.
[46:54.39]I'm going to put that in the collector's dish because it's a collector's item.
[46:58.51]So I think we got to move on from there.
[46:59.93]We got to play a good one, right?
[47:02.65]And I'm gonna play, right now, one of my favorite arcade games ever made.
[47:06.67]So, strapping, you might be here for, this is gonna be at least a 40 minute thing here.
[47:12.53]Going in next, is none other, than Dynamite Cop.
[47:24.74]This is the best arcade game ever made.
[47:27.00]I actually think it was called Die Hard, in the arcades.
[47:39.45]Maybe we'll actually get to hear the intro.
[47:47.15]Wouldn't that be great?
[47:51.17]Did you just say that this game was bad?
[47:55.78]This game's bad?
[47:58.96]What?
[48:01.58]Here we go.
[48:11.65]TED talk today.
[48:14.09]We're gonna talk about setting goals Here we go my favorite fucking arcade caution a memory card is required in order to save dynamite cop data Please select a door without a very yeah, it's this one now prepare yourself for dynamite cop I
[48:45.65]We have a situation down there.
[48:47.73]Some modern day pirates have hijacked a huge cruiser.
[48:51.26]They're holding 2,000 hostages inside, including the president's daughter.
[48:56.00]We have to invade the ship, clear the pirates, and rescue the hostages, especially the president's daughter.
[49:03.86]I'm on it.
[49:08.01]There ain't even no title screen.
[49:09.09]That's how good this game is.
[49:12.13]You just go.
[49:15.08]Some of your favourites, some of your video games you like have fucking title screens.
[49:18.15]Oh, there's... there's... I love this game so much.
[49:21.97]Here's the title screen, never mind.
[49:30.12]I'm gonna beat this fucking game on stream.
[49:32.14]Alright, let's go to other.
[49:35.04]Just for a second here.
[49:38.69]Options, use one.
[49:40.19]Options.
[49:41.59]Every time you go into a beat-em-up style game like this, you always want to make sure that you... Check to make sure that there's no... You're not on, like, the lowest amount of rests.
[49:51.66]I know some of you boomers will know what I'm talking about.
[49:53.50]Here.
[49:57.20]Dynamite Cop.
[50:01.96]Ooh, there's more... Wait.
[50:04.49]There's two?
[50:05.01]Is this DLC campaign?
[50:07.09]I guess we're doing this one.
[50:09.80]Alright, I got a pick.
[50:13.72]Wait, that guy had... Why does that guy have like a... I need to see this.
[50:19.28]Wait, is this even the same?
[50:23.22]This is the same name.
[50:24.26]No, is this the right... Is this the right game?
[50:26.69]That guy had like a little animal on his shoulder.
[50:42.15]Okay, I don't know what the controls are.
[50:43.33]Hold on.
[50:46.88]Where's kick?
[50:47.32]That's grab.
[50:48.82]Yep, there's the suplex.
[50:51.22]That's kick.
[50:51.68]Okay, here we go.
[50:54.07]They all do the same scream when they die?
[50:55.49]Yep, I remember.
[51:07.58]This is the tutorial mission.
[51:10.44]Yeah, it's different pitches of the same sound.
[51:13.92]There's weapons, there's guns.
[51:17.76]I think there's quick time events too, if I remember.
[51:19.68]Yeah, give me that.
[51:24.92]Come here, come here, come here.
[51:37.09]a turtle who's the turtle guy I give me the soda that's a heel I remember I think I'm super mode right now DDT double DDT double DDT into a scoop slam ain't gonna happen
[52:07.32]Anything else?
[52:09.30]Let's go.
[52:15.22]Here we go.
[52:20.26]Left.
[52:24.32]The guns!
[52:25.22]If they have guns, you're in trouble.
[52:34.38]Captain Gonzales.
[52:36.22]Oh.
[52:42.18]Jump away, jump away, dash, dash, dash.
[52:43.36]I don't even- I gotta- That's a power-up.
[52:46.57]Where's he going?
[52:47.93]Bazooka.
[52:55.55]Give me the airship missile.
[52:57.91]Are they just posing?
[53:02.88]I just dropped a fucking nuke.
[53:04.42]Now I remember why I love this game so much.
[53:10.94]Give me the lawn chair!
[53:18.38]Anybody else?
[53:18.90]No, that's a little mini-boss.
[53:19.72]Give me the heals, though.
[53:22.04]Okay.
[53:26.12]This is in-your-face, fast-paced.
[53:29.38]What?
[53:29.60]Why is she inside the suitcase?
[53:42.00]This game was in arcades, but they kind of remade it.
[53:45.97]Hold on.
[53:46.23]Hold on.
[53:52.51]So, this was a die-hard game, I think.
[53:55.11]It was in the arcade, they licensed it, then they ported it to Dreamcast.
[53:58.01]Entitled it differently, from what I understand.
[54:01.63]I could be wrong, and I might be remembering that completely incorrectly.
[54:04.74]But I think it is.
[54:06.72]Anybody else?
[54:14.32]Fix the audio?
[54:15.52]What's going on with the audio?
[54:19.60]Audio's fucked up?
[54:20.52]What do you mean?
[54:24.64]Out of sync?
[54:25.18]Are you talking about like my voice to the game or are you talking about like the game audio is not synced right?
[54:44.90]It's the game audio, okay, hold on.
[54:48.66]So you're hearing sounds first.
[54:53.40]Oh wait, kick!
[55:00.30]Tell me how that sounds.
[55:04.68]Better?
[55:06.68]Oh fuck, he scoops lemon.
[55:09.20]Are these people's heads on sticks?
[55:22.57]Shit, he's got the head!
[55:25.59]No, I don't wanna die!
[55:34.99]There's different, like, combinations you can do as well.
[55:37.89]Oh, fuck.
[55:41.93]I believe, I believe, like, A and B. Holy fuck, he's got double.
[55:44.64]Pick him up, off the ground.
[55:53.42]Oh, I remember this.
[56:01.58]Oh, this game is so much fun.
[56:04.93]Hair sample?
[56:08.31]What we got?
[56:15.70]I guess that's the end of that guy.
[56:22.22]I think I got a boss coming up here.
[56:23.54]Give me the food!
[56:33.10]Don't stay up here.
[56:34.24]Is it a loaf of bread or is it a missile?
[56:35.46]I don't know.
[56:39.78]Shit.
[56:44.39]It's a French roll.
[56:54.44]Stream saved.
[56:55.62]What happened?
[57:00.56]No, he doesn't have a gun.
[57:02.18]How do you throw?
[57:02.98]There's a throw button, I think, where I can just whip it.
[57:06.56]How do I fucking throw this thing?
[57:14.81]I don't want to use the bread anymore!
[57:16.05]Get rid of it!
[57:21.35]Why do I have an axe?
[57:27.20]Alright, food.
[57:27.90]I need to eat.
[57:29.18]Eat the cake.
[57:30.54]What?
[57:32.11]Oh, throwing the cake at him.
[57:35.77]Why can't I eat the bread?
[57:45.87]Oh, fuck!
[57:52.89]Cake.
[57:53.31]Just eat it.
[57:55.07]Eat cake.
[57:55.87]There it is.
[58:02.04]I just lost all the health I just got.
[58:09.30]Fuck, you just linked me.
[58:10.32]Come on, man.
[58:12.78]Alright.
[58:18.84]I'm good.
[58:19.62]I'm good.
[58:24.26]What is it?
[58:33.38]Oh, the chef!
[58:34.00]Do the burners turn on?
[58:37.50]I don't think they do.
[58:42.03]Food?
[58:42.29]Give me the apples.
[58:51.19]Just eat him!
[58:54.39]There's gotta be more food in here than just... Oh my fucking god, he just throws dynamite in his own kitchen.
[59:09.75]What the fuck?
[59:11.92]The crab walks back up.
[59:13.74]Any more food in here?
[59:16.56]Donkey Kong barrel.
[59:22.32]How many?
[59:22.60]I think I got three continues.
[59:31.54]Give me more!
[59:31.98]I need more environmental stuff!
[59:39.94]Are those grenades?
[59:43.27]Give me the grenades.
[59:44.57]Yep.
[59:45.79]You can't eat grenades, can you?
[59:53.63]This should be doing way more damage, shouldn't it?
[60:00.28]What else we got?
[60:00.88]Take the whole thing.
[60:04.10]Any more burners?
[60:09.74]Alright, back up, back up, back up, back up.
[60:14.80]Can I reach in here and grab anything?
[60:16.04]I don't think so.
[60:16.64]I think I got all the environmental stuff out of the way.
[60:20.66]Oh, god.
[60:25.46]Ouch.
[60:34.33]Oh, dropping frames again.
[60:35.51]It's gonna happen.
[60:36.11]I gotta, I gotta get, uh, once this frame is over, I gotta make a few phone calls.
[60:39.01]Because this is the second day in a row.
[60:41.79]Well, second stream in a row where we've had internet problems, so.
[60:44.59]Gonna have to get somebody else out here again.
[60:47.94]I'm not even gonna get up from that, I don't think.
[60:54.56]Oh my god.
[61:03.28]No, it's not.
[61:03.98]It's a problem with the internet here.
[61:05.76]And it's very distracting.
[61:09.25]It's very annoying.
[61:10.57]I would have got a full health pack too.
[61:21.73]Yeah, we'll probably drop like 50,000 frames this stream.
[61:26.60]Whatever.
[61:29.08]There's not much I can do about it, unfortunately.
[61:32.06]This is dynamite pop, for those of you wondering.
[61:47.33]That was not graceful at all.
[61:49.39]It just fell out of there.
[61:53.19]Get him!
[61:55.05]He shouldn't be able to do that.
[61:55.95]That's not fair.
[62:03.40]I still can't... Alright, finally he comes up.
[62:05.04]I'm trying to aim at him.
[62:18.85]Throw him this way.
[62:25.39]Ugh, is it really just getting worse?
[62:28.43]God.
[62:32.27]Killed that guy so bad he died twice.
[62:33.89]This is a good gun!
[62:42.08]I think I can bounce him around.
[62:48.12]Yep.
[63:07.83]So, uh, it's hard to try to pay attention to two things at the same time.
[63:11.46]How, is it, are we, is it like, unwatchable?
[63:17.32]It seems just consistently not.
[63:19.12]And right when we get to the crab enemies, really, they're gonna give me this internet bullshit when I'm doing one of my favorite Dreamcast games with the fucking crabs.
[63:26.91]That's unbelievable.
[63:35.53]Come here.
[63:36.09]Get him.
[63:42.86]Give me the piece of meat.
[63:44.12]Am I?
[63:47.08]I don't think I am.
[63:51.70]Oh, no.
[64:19.89]Alright, he's done.
[64:22.25]7,100 fucking frames dropped.
[64:23.56]God damn, it's been one hour.
[64:24.82]It's so aggravating.
[64:30.02]Take that suitcase.
[64:51.15]I wasn't even... I just broke my fucking neck.
[64:55.69]I just... Whatever.
[65:17.50]I don't even know where the hell we even are.
[65:18.92]What room is this?
[65:20.16]Is this the engine room or something?
[65:22.64]I don't get it.
[65:25.46]I'll get a black box.
[65:27.25]If I can.
[65:31.11]I'll stand on those.
[65:31.97]No!
[65:32.73]I was trying to juggle them!
[65:38.17]Everybody wants the black box so bad!
[65:45.63]Come here!
[65:52.67]Something in there?
[65:54.15]Still one missile left.
[65:54.97]Nice.
[65:58.11]Really?
[65:58.43]Do I get infinite continues?
[66:03.19]I might get infinite continues.
[66:04.53]This is great.
[66:05.05]It doesn't even matter how bad you are.
[66:18.59]Make sure you... a nuclear bomb does not get rid of this guy.
[66:22.03]Two nukes.
[66:25.63]Okay, you're dead.
[66:29.81]I'm not gonna fail this one.
[66:30.75]I'm gonna be able to pay attention.
[66:33.41]Hit him with a wrench!
[66:38.68]Uh-oh.
[66:47.07]I told you, this game is insane.
[66:49.51]Plug?
[66:50.45]That's a bomb.
[66:51.17]Stimulating those things.
[67:00.33]Power, power, power!
[67:01.05]Alright, I got power up.
[67:01.73]Right in the middle.
[67:06.79]I got boxing gloves.
[67:18.20]The octopus has to die!
[67:22.20]Jump!
[67:22.48]Ahh!
[67:22.88]80-20.
[67:34.29]Die!
[67:36.21]Health pack?
[67:38.89]Nope.
[67:40.19]Oh, you gotta see this, though.
[67:40.97]This is great.
[67:41.47]Not yet, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[67:45.29]Welcome to the UFOs.
[67:54.13]So I'm kind of confused.
[67:55.43]Are they not aware that she's inside of the crate?
[68:01.88]He's bringing his pink suitcase around.
[68:03.46]He doesn't know that she's in there.
[68:09.58]I think that's what's going on.
[68:21.14]He just carries his luggage everywhere, apparently.
[68:24.77]It's a nice chicken in there.
[68:28.33]It's a Monster Rancher.
[68:30.23]Monster.
[68:50.11]Dead.
[68:57.89]I can't go in there, but they can come out.
[69:05.30]Can I open this?
[69:06.16]I might be able to break it.
[69:22.82]I need to do some more suplexes and stuff, but I don't know, I forget how to do them.
[69:32.82]I wasn't trying to kill him, I was just trying to open his crate.
[69:44.27]What the fuck?
[69:46.31]Oh god.
[69:49.65]Alright, come on down.
[69:51.51]I'll get you with the pendulum.
[70:00.65]Where did he get the gun?
[70:01.87]You just have a pistol?
[70:03.57]How could you get- ugh.
[70:05.39]He just pulled that out of nowhere.
[70:07.63]They split every time.
[70:09.60]He's doing a lot of damage.
[70:12.78]My god!
[70:13.66]That hurts.
[70:24.89]Don't even let him get up.
[70:31.51]That guy just tried to raid me.
[70:40.02]Did he block the bullets with his hands?
[70:53.23]Can I get both those swords?
[71:05.56]I'm trying to do other moves.
[71:11.90]I remember this shitty game!
[71:14.50]Shitty game.
[71:18.80]Who said this game was shitty?
[71:22.06]This is a classic.
[71:31.87]Slot machine.
[71:32.73]This is such random shit in this game.
[71:34.31]I just got pizza'd.
[71:36.23]It's a hand toss.
[71:37.11]What is this?
[71:38.76]Give me this thing.
[71:39.34]Oh, it's pepper.
[71:43.10]Can I eat the pepper?
[71:44.02]Okay.
[71:52.36]He just makes him sneeze.
[71:56.30]What are those recovery moves?
[72:06.39]That's like a horror movie trailer, get pulled out of the room.
[72:11.21]Can I do something with this lava shot?
[72:19.04]Come on, seven, seven!
[72:21.73]No!
[72:22.11]Do it again!
[72:24.39]Give me something cool!
[72:30.37]So, if he pulls it, does he get the whatever's in there?
[72:36.92]No, I don't want to leave here without getting the jackpot.
[72:49.24]Here I come!
[72:56.37]No.
[72:56.95]Spin it again.
[72:58.81]Do it again.
[73:00.27]The machine actually broke.
[73:06.01]Why?
[73:06.49]What the fuck?
[73:08.25]That's unfortunate.
[73:16.18]Dermot has played Quiet Man and Dynamite Man.
[73:22.08]Well, this is Dynamite Cup.
[73:31.61]Two back-to-backs.
[73:33.15]Gotta... ...dump them into the ocean.
[73:35.49]I don't know why... ...these were so much harder to do in the arcade.
[73:44.39]Maybe it's because I was... ...14 or something.
[73:48.25]But I remember that was a big deal.
[73:49.33]Did I just kick that guy in the balls?
[74:04.09]Bow and arrows, cool.
[74:12.50]Double machine guns?
[74:13.84]Make sure you don't sharpen an axe with your hands, guys.
[74:19.70]That's a bad fucking idea.
[74:32.50]Infinite continues.
[74:34.56]That was stylish.
[74:48.47]Don't...
[74:58.38]Can I sharpen my axe?
[74:59.28]I thought I could pick up the mast.
[75:03.12]Sharpen my axes with my face.
[75:04.42]Alright, this guy... I was gonna say, this guy shouldn't even love me.
[75:30.97]No, he's breaking up my combos, you dick.
[75:36.05]Stop!
[75:42.24]Why is my combos breaking?
[75:49.04]This way.
[75:54.30]Would you classify this game as a reverse Bayonetta?
[75:57.73]The more damage I take, my clothes come off.
[76:01.49]As in Bayonetta, the more damage you do, your clothes come off.
[76:15.24]Now you're doing this.
[76:21.68]Dammit.
[76:22.80]That didn't work.
[76:25.78]Come here.
[76:26.38]Come here!
[76:33.09]Got it.
[76:33.35]Now it's time for the final boss.
[76:36.23]I'm ready.
[76:41.01]Help me!
[76:44.38]Step on her head!
[76:45.36]You were in my suitcase!
[76:48.82]You threw my beach towels out of there to get in there, didn't you?
[76:53.55]I have changed my body to destroy you.
[76:59.17]How did he change his body?
[77:01.07]Uh oh, this is not gonna go well.
[77:16.24]Standard combo, that's it.
[77:19.46]Where did he get the gun?
[77:28.33]He's shooting that in his face.
[77:31.67]That's wildly unfair.
[77:34.51]Watch out, what is he... How are you supposed to dodge that?
[77:38.01]This is the way that they farm quarters.
[77:39.69]Yeah, I remember this.
[77:43.27]This is like the... I remember me and my friend on the car ride home in my mother's car.
[77:46.81]Talking about, to each other, back and forth like... You know, arcades are so fucking stupid, man.
[77:52.00]That's like a way that they just guarantee that they take quarters from you because you're gonna die like five times.
[77:59.13]I really had that conversation.
[78:00.53]Ask him!
[78:00.99]He lost his sword.
[78:10.60]See?
[78:11.00]Look.
[78:11.36]Alright, let's go, man!
[78:15.42]Come on!
[78:15.88]Don't let the continue go down!
[78:17.61]And then sometimes you have to debate with your friend whether or not you want to put another quarter in.
[78:20.97]You both put like seven and a half dollars into the game, right?
[78:26.19]And then the countdown is happening.
[78:27.59]If you don't continue, you start from the very beginning again.
[78:30.56]And you have to debate with your buddy whether or not you want to move on to a different game or you've got to finish this, we've got to beat it.
[78:36.40]And you have five fucking seconds to figure it out.
[78:47.35]He ripped off my clothes!
[78:54.22]Dodge right.
[78:55.66]No, don't bring back those memories.
[78:57.16]Got him.
[78:57.44]Great cutscene.
[78:57.84]I didn't skip it.
[79:25.55]Are they all smoking cigarettes?
[79:28.34]Why did she just kick me in the head?
[79:31.10]Wait, what was that traitor's shit in the end?
[79:39.21]The island is still there.
[79:46.04]He didn't even get rid of the island.
[79:48.60]Some other bad guy will take up shop in there.
[79:51.22]There's two more chapters, two more DLCs.
[80:10.66]Thank you for saving my life again.
[80:11.96]Roundhouse kick to the part of your head where it's going to kill you.
[80:17.70]Right?
[80:18.24]That heel went directly into the back portion of my head where my skull connects to my neck.
[80:24.63]That is dead.
[80:26.71]You're dead.
[80:27.23]Is this supposed to be ominous?
[80:38.21]Did I lose?
[80:47.93]It freezes at such a perfect time.
[80:49.95]Alright.
[80:51.35]Let's go.
[80:53.43]Let's try.
[80:54.15]Let's see the other campaigns.
[81:00.23]Let's go 1, 2, 3 right down the aisle here.
[81:02.59]Let's go Jean.
[81:07.08]Back to the ring.
[81:07.96]No, I'm beating all these.
[81:08.88]Mission 1, Mission 2.
[81:13.54]Wait.
[81:18.40]This is the same mission?
[81:32.59]Oh.
[81:35.43]Look at that kick, though.
[81:40.27]Oh, the girl is great!
[81:42.23]Jean Ivy's great!
[81:44.95]Look at these moves.
[81:59.45]Now I understand a few things about this game that I didn't understand before.
[82:03.19]A thing that I understand, one... There's the whole one, sorry, I gotta clean the floor with these fucking chumps.
[82:18.40]Yeah, that's the whole game.
[82:19.66]But what's the other one, though?
[82:21.92]What's the showdown one?
[82:27.57]This game is like 40, this game is not even 30 minutes long.
[82:31.47]They were just farming quarters.
[82:32.75]Oh, I just want everyone to do me a quick favor and just remember just how much money this game was.
[82:41.86]I severely underestimated just how much content was in this game.
[82:44.98]I think this game was like somewhere around $100 to get.
[82:46.51]I think.
[82:46.75]Oops.
[83:00.24]It's like a very rare Dreamcast game.
[83:03.74]And I thought it was gonna be like... I'm keeping it, and guess what?
[83:07.90]It's an asset now, and it's gonna appreciate the value.
[83:16.19]And then in 30 more years, I will give Dynamite Cop to somebody in my family and be like, Hey, check this out.
[83:23.23]Dreamcast was a system.
[83:24.97]All these are gonna appreciate the value.
[83:30.20]This is different.
[83:39.64]No, this is different.
[83:40.34]This is different, guys.
[83:42.04]It is.
[83:42.88]It's different.
[83:53.83]Yeah, it's the same enemies, but you fight them in different sequences.
[84:09.22]Look at the power-ups.
[84:09.90]Come on, pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee pee.
[84:28.75]Yeah, this didn't happen in the last game.
[84:29.81]The same cutscenes?
[84:30.45]This time she's under the bed, not in the suitcase.
[84:35.26]Different variations of the cutscene.
[84:40.13]Procedurally generated.
[84:41.33]Uh... Procedure generated hiding girl.
[84:44.71]That's good.
[84:53.08]Gimme gimme gimme gimme gimme.
[84:56.26]Gimme it, gimme it.
[84:56.96]No, gimme it, gimme it, gimme it.
[84:57.94]No, I don't want the spear!
[84:59.32]No!
[85:04.77]What does the lighter do?
[85:08.38]There's gotta be a way to cycle between items, right?
[85:10.40]Let's see if I can grab him.
[85:17.55]No, he died.
[85:18.09]Let's see what this does.
[85:21.07]Just uppercut?
[85:37.59]Am I in the bathroom?
[85:40.17]Okay, these are new environments, guys.
[85:43.89]Wonderful.
[86:05.86]I'm gonna try and do my best impression now.
[86:41.16]I can't.
[86:49.23]Sorry, guys.
[86:49.79]Hey, I'm available for consultation work, you know what I mean?
[87:07.24]That's a deep cough.
[87:18.98]Ow.
[87:27.77]She sneezed herself to death.
[87:31.77]I told you sneezes are very dangerous.
[87:46.84]Uh-oh.
[87:48.32]Oh god, the clothes are coming off.
[87:49.62]For those of you guys that are wondering when we move to the next game... This was very expensive, so I'm gonna get... I'm gonna get my money's worth.
[88:11.42]Because I want to play through the game.
[88:14.12]I can't just play this for 5-10 minutes and then go on.
[88:17.00]No.
[88:17.46]I wanna get- I paid- I wanna get my money's worth.
[88:19.84]I don't remember what jump is.
[88:22.01]Alright, here we go.
[88:29.39]It's the... Is this the same?
[88:31.99]This is not the same boss.
[88:35.06]This is a different boss?
[88:40.90]No, it's-
[88:49.69]I'm so confused.
[88:51.09]Alright, give me the fish.
[88:53.43]Can I eat it?
[88:54.61]Oh, that's a lot of tuna.
[89:01.46]Somebody count the deaths from the last... Anybody have an opportunity to do that?
[89:09.34]How many times did I die last time?
[89:14.37]Because we're gonna determine how expensive this was.
[89:17.01]We'll see if it's the same amount of money that it was on Amazon.
[89:25.32]Those grenades!
[89:33.27]No way!
[89:33.75]No way!
[89:34.07]Did you see that combo?!
[89:37.81]He's going to Evo next weekend!
[89:40.96]No, Evo's up in August.
[89:57.47]Evo next weekend.
[89:58.47]Let's see, where is she now?
[90:06.90]Under the bed?
[90:08.22]In a suitcase?
[90:10.40]Hanging somewhere, like, from the rafters or something?
[90:18.55]Like peeking over the rafters.
[90:23.91]Still not graceful.
[90:29.83]I just arrested that person.
[90:33.66]How did I do that?
[90:38.00]I don't know how to... How did I arrest that person?
[90:46.80]I'm so confused right now.
[90:53.36]Pizza face!
[90:54.50]Why would you rob?
[90:55.96]You can only do that with a handgun.
[91:19.65]Empty your pockets.
[91:21.77]Not only are you under arrest, but I want the money in your wallet.
[91:35.62]Empty your pockets, pizza face.
[91:38.48]That's a little wild.
[91:39.30]They're not crabs this time, they are... sharks.
[91:56.80]It's still aquatic in nature, but not, uh, not land.
[92:07.07]Oh, come on, he slid.
[92:17.19]Don't start singing the baby shark thing.
[92:27.24]That was unbelievable.
[92:29.76]That was essentially breaking every bone.
[92:35.74]Baby shark!
[92:44.96]Why would you say that?
[92:45.82]I didn't say it, somebody else did, and I just re-implied to it.
[92:49.88]Still under the bed.
[92:57.19]Okay, still under the bed.
[93:00.71]So does she not... Do we not get her out?
[93:07.04]I am really confused.
[93:08.42]Because they took her in the suitcase last time.
[93:12.00]So she's still... No, I want to freeze!
[93:20.41]Oh, you assholes.
[93:31.44]That's so many broken bombs.
[93:34.93]That person is not gonna take a long time to heal.
[93:46.02]Have I died, whoa, a few times in this one?
[93:52.54]Fuck.
[93:55.45]Just give me the nuclear bombs.
[94:01.67]It's fun to shoot these in here, knowing that only one of them will blow up the whole island.
[94:05.17]But not in here.
[94:11.74]Don't shoot!
[94:13.04]Ooh, nice kick.
[94:32.11]And he said, no Luigi.
[94:34.91]What?
[94:35.17]Because he has a green costume on?
[94:43.44]Well, still the same octopus encounter.
[94:51.28]No!
[95:00.59]No!
[95:00.89]Dodge it!
[95:03.32]That's why I need friends to play.
[95:05.52]If somebody distracts the squid while other people fight it.
[95:09.52]I guess I can hit the head too.
[95:12.92]There's guns over here.
[95:24.48]Give me the other... whatever this is.
[95:27.00]Fourth of July popsicle thing.
[95:32.32]What are you dropping from the ceiling?
[95:33.50]You seen that last time?
[95:40.12]Well, if the squid wants to fight you, well... It's happening.
[95:50.75]Not that time.
[95:59.21]Super deep cock.
[96:00.49]I love it.
[96:10.73]Can I arrest the squid?
[96:12.69]No.
[96:13.89]Imagine you could put his arms behind his back.
[96:28.18]We're almost there.
[96:33.64]Ooh.
[96:36.28]I was under the bed too.
[96:38.98]I was also hiding.
[96:42.31]Where did that guy come from?
[96:55.80]God, that was so hard.
[96:58.30]That... That was so hard.
[97:00.68]Even more casino games.
[97:01.92]Good.
[97:03.10]Come here.
[97:10.51]Well, we found the speedrun character.
[97:11.75]You just need a handgun.
[97:14.61]Dammit.
[97:18.50]What is this?
[97:22.38]A coin bucket?
[97:23.68]Oh, for the casino.
[97:46.96]This is back when casinos still had like coin buckets, isn't it?
[98:08.13]No.
[98:09.45]Throw this away.
[98:10.05]How do you... I wish I knew how to throw.
[98:12.39]I'm not sure that there is.
[98:13.63]Alright, arrest.
[98:15.83]You're under arrest.
[98:26.15]Oh my god.
[98:26.89]Why do you have reach across the whole map?
[98:29.26]Just... You're... Now I can't even arrest him.
[98:37.79]Fucking dumb sword shit.
[98:39.81]Caution.
[98:44.91]Almost to the top.
[98:45.59]That was awesome.
[98:47.19]Here comes another one.
[98:48.81]There goes Nat Hagel.
[99:07.18]Those guys are just bringing booze to a party.
[99:12.71]You get these last little snippets.
[99:15.23]You just stabbed him in the fucking skull with this.
[99:38.36]No!
[99:41.66]Give me the gun!
[99:43.10]Arrest!
[99:47.79]No, I'm done.
[99:48.59]I'm done with that.
[99:49.43]Just... Now you're allowed to die.
[100:07.90]Can I pick up the piano?
[100:12.77]That's unfortunate.
[100:13.65]Maybe I can break it.
[100:16.49]When you get powers up, you get extra moves.
[100:25.32]That's good.
[100:25.76]Piano.
[100:26.68]Nope.
[100:37.58]Give me that.
[100:43.45]He died before I could do anything.
[100:45.89]Don't shoot me!
[101:06.17]I only have four continues left.
[101:07.71]Same guy.
[101:10.71]I'm so broken up by that.
[101:13.88]Come here.
[101:35.95]I only have four cont- I only have four continues left, you're right.
[101:38.45]Is that for real?
[101:39.73]Shit, it is real.
[101:42.17]Alright, no more fu- I can't fuck around, I actually have to beat this.
[102:05.05]That was unbelievable.
[102:07.41]Ah!
[102:22.23]Oh, come on.
[102:26.95]What's the stamina bar?
[102:27.95]Why do you have a bigger stamina bar than me?
[102:29.73]Poor baby.
[102:36.34]Yeah, you're trying to fucking farm coins from me.
[102:40.48]That's not what I wanted to pick up.
[102:41.44]Okay.
[102:47.37]Miner blossom coming.
[102:50.93]So there you are.
[102:53.27]I've been expecting you.
[102:54.87]I have changed my body to destroy you.
[102:59.23]Now, let's have some fun.
[103:08.89]No!
[103:09.43]I tried to dodge it.
[103:10.41]I'm trying to get away from you when you do that.
[103:25.67]No!
[103:30.71]He gets like a guaranteed hit.
[103:59.94]Give me the cheats.
[104:00.64]I got the cheats.
[104:01.18]It's going to spin again.
[104:02.69]No, he's not.
[104:03.35]Back suplex him.
[104:06.07]Throw him over the...
[104:27.44]What the fuck was that?
[104:28.62]He just shot like a meatball out of his eye.
[104:31.09]Got in the face!
[104:32.69]No!
[104:32.95]Yep, you gotta hit him.
[104:57.36]I got one credit left.
[104:58.49]I can't fuck this up.
[104:59.41]Just play it safe.
[105:01.73]That's not safe!
[105:03.51]He's dead.
[105:30.83]Let's see the new ending.
[105:33.17]Thank you for saving my life again.
[105:34.91]Okay.
[105:40.63]Wait a minute.
[105:44.90]He's not... What?
[105:51.78]What a hacker!
[106:05.69]There's no way.
[106:06.31]Okay.
[106:07.17]To double-click on your desktop and open up hackprogram.exe, it'd probably take... You ever opened up Photoshop?
[106:15.07]A program that's that elaborate.
[106:17.87]It's gonna take like 30 to 40 seconds to open.
[106:28.58]There it is.
[106:35.53]What is this game and how do I play it?
[106:37.15]This is Dynamite Cop.
[106:40.01]It's for the Dreamcast.
[106:43.19]It's only on Dreamcast.
[106:44.61]There's only two ways you could possibly play this game.
[106:47.20]You have to get a Dreamcast.
[106:50.74]Or you have to emulate the game.
[106:52.78]And emulation is fairly difficult.
[106:57.30]But those are really the only two possible ways to play it.
[107:05.16]Alright, here we go.
[107:06.18]Game over.
[107:11.54]Emulation is fine.
[107:12.92]Um... It really depends on what emulator.
[107:16.32]Because... I've tried to use, like, PS2 era plus PS3 era emulators before.
[107:25.66]And they're not quite there yet.
[107:27.92]They function, and some of them function fairly well.
[107:31.76]But for the sake of making sure that there's no problems...
[107:36.72]I've emulated before, and it just doesn't work out well.
[107:39.86]Alright, I got... We're going to try... Well, we're going to do the last mission.
[107:51.45]We're going to go with Eddie.
[107:52.45]And we're going to do mission three.
[108:01.03]So this is from underwater.
[108:02.67]Go!
[108:03.07]Move it!
[108:07.83]only emulated games that you physically own.
[108:09.87]That's pretty much how it works.
[108:11.31]Plus, I like having the actual physical thing here.
[108:22.88]Having a Dreamcast or having a PlayStation 2 is... Can I ride that? ...
[108:39.52]Why do I only get four credits?
[108:42.91]What's with the four credits?
[108:43.79]Have you seen that?
[108:52.61]I gotta play well.
[108:54.21]Are they alive, or...?
[109:09.97]Yeah, this actually is hard mode.
[109:12.35]Alright, I got super, and I got a new gun.
[109:17.08]No, why did you?
[109:17.88]Why did you do that?
[109:24.28]Animation death?
[109:26.94]This?
[109:39.29]Over the rim.
[109:47.89]This from this early?
[109:54.55]Isn't this usually more than halfway through?
[109:58.93]Ah, shit.
[109:59.65]I'm not supposed to get hit.
[110:06.09]Oh!
[110:08.47]Oh, bad positioning.
[110:09.79]Oh, didn't catch it.
[110:32.62]Yeah, I'm putting on some try-hard fancy, for real.
[110:35.28]Because I want to do this.
[110:36.96]I want to get to the end.
[110:42.73]It's three different sequences.
[110:44.17]Plays out three different ways.
[110:46.87]We'll find out for real here.
[110:49.21]Hurry up with that bomb.
[110:51.37]And where is that girl?
[110:53.31]Find her and bring her to me.
[110:57.01]She got out.
[110:57.43]Alright, she's sneaking around now.
[111:04.86]Oh no, he's here!
[111:07.02]I wasn't ready!
[111:09.08]What is this?
[111:16.21]Umbrella.
[111:19.13]She's dead.
[111:23.33]I need every heal.
[111:25.66]Alright, Moments of Full Health.
[111:26.50]No credits have been used.
[111:35.68]Another one down.
[111:36.24]Pretty much full health.
[111:39.68]Good.
[111:41.78]No!
[111:42.11]What?
[111:46.01]Nope.
[111:51.61]Wait room.
[112:04.76]Let me just pick up the bike machine.
[112:06.96]Yeah, those don't weigh like 4,000 pounds or anything.
[112:15.73]Guy just got out of the sauna.
[112:17.91]You're never ready for a fight when you get out of the sauna.
[112:29.42]Guy brings two guns into the sauna.
[112:34.88]Relax.
[112:36.07]Let their hard days work.
[112:38.37]I love the poster in the back.
[112:45.95]It's a beautiful poster.
[112:49.15]This dude's got the best combos?
[112:51.06]Seems like it.
[112:56.04]So what's the chef gonna be?
[113:03.13]Because we're about to fight the chef, and we're gonna see what is inside of there now.
[113:07.27]What are those?
[113:17.30]Twist.
[113:18.90]Alright.
[113:20.90]On the back.
[113:27.64]What are they, pork buns?
[113:29.22]Oh, these are mine.
[113:35.60]No, shit.
[113:36.62]Not even worth it.
[113:37.88]They don't heal as much.
[113:39.08]Because you're getting hit one time.
[113:40.46]That's the power.
[113:48.23]Let's go.
[113:58.19]Come here.
[113:59.65]No!
[114:03.77]Let me load a clip into the axe.
[114:06.41]Oh, I ran right into it.
[114:16.20]Ugh!
[114:16.30]Alright, I'm good.
[114:43.39]These guys do a lot... The dual welders do a lot of damage.
[114:50.51]Like that.
[114:50.87]Now I'm just getting poked.
[114:52.83]Those are tiny pokes.
[115:01.58]Ah!
[115:02.54]Behind me!
[115:02.96]No!
[115:04.34]Do you have... Is there a heal over here?
[115:11.92]There is.
[115:23.73]Health.
[115:25.39]Get it!
[115:25.67]Alright.
[115:33.36]Alright, what is the chef?
[115:42.13]It's... I don't know.
[115:57.41]Come on.
[115:58.15]There's no way you're going to be able to stunlock me over here.
[116:01.09]You probably can.
[116:01.95]That's dog shit.
[116:09.07]Come on.
[116:09.41]Right into the fucking camera.
[116:11.57]Oh.
[116:34.43]No, don't crap walk over here.
[116:35.94]How did you not get hit by any of those?
[116:47.13]No, no credits.
[116:48.21]Come on, there's a drink right there.
[116:51.99]Barely even healing me.
[117:12.68]Got it.
[117:13.10]Alright.
[117:13.94]Watch out!
[117:20.36]There we go.
[117:21.46]I'll get him here.
[117:24.24]Block every single punch.
[117:36.26]There we go.
[117:36.82]One credit down.
[117:48.77]Where's girl?
[117:49.79]Blow it up.
[117:50.25]Activate the bomb.
[117:52.89]No sign of the girl, somehow.
[118:08.25]Gonna utilize this.
[118:10.07]Come on, Dad.
[118:10.81]Alright, they're both dead.
[118:14.83]Move.
[118:15.19]I can't pick that up.
[118:20.12]That's weird.
[118:40.80]I'm trying so hard.
[118:50.03]Alright.
[118:59.66]One more and I get the power.
[119:13.28]Why?
[119:14.02]Okay.
[119:16.37]Oh, it's the lie.
[119:17.91]He's the liar.
[119:18.57]That was awesome.
[119:30.62]That was so cool.
[119:32.16]I'm glad we got to see it.
[119:34.28]And I didn't screw it up.
[119:41.88]I have a lighter.
[119:43.78]Holy shit.
[119:44.82]No!
[119:45.40]That was so cool.
[119:46.30]That was a lot of damage, probably.
[119:52.96]Maybe not.
[119:57.62]Doesn't feel like it's doing that much damage.
[120:02.04]Oh, you bastard.
[120:04.94]No!
[120:05.72]God damn!
[120:19.25]Someone dead.
[120:26.40]I don't want that right now.
[120:27.42]I don't want to pick that up.
[120:31.02]I think it's a waste.
[120:32.62]I'd rather save that for a boss or a hard encounter.
[120:46.66]Okay.
[120:48.71]Come up with a broom.
[120:49.85]Come on.
[120:55.05]Why do you have so- this guy has so much health!
[121:01.19]Okay.
[121:04.09]It's looking good.
[121:05.37]There's only one major boss left, and it's the last guy.
[121:08.85]No, actually there's two bosses.
[121:24.38]These cutscenes are ridiculous.
[121:27.04]They're so quick.
[121:38.79]What just hit me in the face?
[121:40.25]Did I do it?
[121:55.62]Alright, dead?
[121:56.48]No.
[121:57.64]Alright, I'm good.
[122:05.49]I need the health.
[122:06.09]I need it.
[122:06.49]I have to take it.
[122:07.15]Give it to me.
[122:08.07]You stupid fucking game.
[122:13.43]That's okay.
[122:14.13]It's actually pretty good here.
[122:26.04]This is not going to be good.
[122:26.88]This ain't looking good.
[122:27.76]Do it again.
[122:39.18]Stop coughing.
[122:49.79]Ah, I'm not going to dodge quicker than that.
[123:01.00]This guy's actually worse than any of the other bosses, I think.
[123:04.08]Just because he's so big.
[123:05.70]Got it.
[123:18.03]Okay, you got a health pack?
[123:20.44]You don't.
[123:23.30]Wow, you're so annoying.
[123:24.12]You have to have one.
[123:36.47]what Jesus Christ that was oh my god um the helicopter flew by twice can I rest you can
[124:12.74]That's a strat.
[124:16.14]Get it!
[124:18.26]Wow.
[124:20.43]Wow.
[124:22.45]I can't be standing on top of something?
[124:24.05]Is that what the problem is?
[124:27.33]Okay.
[124:40.14]Alright, is that a heal?
[124:44.50]Dollar Bill!
[124:46.18]What do you do with a Dollar Bill?
[124:53.79]Dollar Bill.
[125:00.17]This will be so easy.
[125:02.81]He can't teleport away.
[125:03.69]These guys are so horrible.
[125:08.24]Okay.
[125:10.94]Really?
[125:11.24]Did I just get... Oh, the thing sticks out.
[125:16.43]You can't do it to the guy with two swords, unfortunately.
[125:22.69]God damn it.
[125:43.25]Ah!
[125:44.97]How did you even?
[125:45.75]I just hit you in the fucking face with a spear.
[125:52.35]What the hell?
[125:53.13]How do you keep scooping me?
[125:55.11]I need to keep some bullets in this.
[126:11.42]I'm scared Jeremy hurry up you go can I arrest the crabs probably not nope oops you're nothing give me this come on there's another handgun back here
[126:41.82]Who else is back here?
[126:43.12]Fire Axe?
[126:49.50]He's dead.
[126:58.42]Come on, give me something from the slot machine!
[127:01.04]I'm a little activated now.
[127:09.45]Just have it for later.
[127:14.82]Okay.
[127:16.68]Good.
[127:17.54]Good.
[127:19.94]Come on before it drains.
[127:26.35]This is it.
[127:32.73]This guy and then we go up to the top and we fight the last boss.
[127:34.95]I just need to be very careful.
[127:42.54]I need a gun.
[127:46.10]Too bad I don't have an actual gun to rest.
[127:51.38]That would help a lot right now.
[127:54.56]No!
[127:54.62]Guns!
[128:16.92]They're gonna shoot!
[128:18.36]Oh!
[128:18.46]There's nowhere to go!
[128:19.23]There's two of them on the ground!
[128:34.40]In the head!
[128:34.92]In the head!
[128:35.38]In the head!
[128:35.94]In the head!
[128:36.42]How many times do I have to shoot you in the head?
[128:40.06]Alright, I got the power up for the boss.
[128:45.15]Let's go!
[128:45.41]Let's go!
[128:45.73]Let's go!
[128:46.01]Let's go!
[128:46.27]Let's go!
[128:52.50]It's different this time.
[128:53.54]He was down twice in a row.
[129:01.24]Another combo with the axe.
[129:08.38]Forget it.
[129:10.04]Just take him down.
[129:11.05]I can do it.
[129:11.75]Come on.
[129:12.07]I just gotta get him.
[129:12.81]Don't!
[129:16.15]That's almost three combos and he's almost dead.
[129:24.08]That's it.
[129:25.30]And I got... Give me the special!
[129:26.58]Yes!
[129:27.24]Alright.
[129:28.18]I'm ready to go.
[129:28.68]I got one credit.
[129:37.74]Just gotta dodge at the right time.
[129:39.76]And I got a special.
[129:56.44]Alright, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge, dodge.
[130:00.22]Watch out, he's gonna kick.
[130:07.49]Kick.
[130:10.05]Ooh!
[130:10.27]Get out of here.
[130:19.28]Get out of here.
[130:20.70]Got it.
[130:23.16]Can't move.
[130:23.98]I win.
[130:26.15]We get to see the last cutscene.
[130:32.38]Alright, how does this one play out?
[130:43.10]He's dead.
[130:44.52]That's it.
[130:48.35]Arguably the worst one.
[130:50.77]That was the worst one.
[130:55.24]It just explodes I think they kind of ran out of time First impressions?
[131:08.51]Um... I mean, it's not first impressions I played this game.
[131:13.23]My first impressions 15-16 years ago were... I'm gonna burn $20 in this machine Wait
[131:27.05]Hold on now.
[131:29.17]There's an after-credits scene.
[131:38.45]Well, now you just earned 100.
[131:40.17]I don't think this one was that much.
[131:43.61]Post-credits?
[131:48.97]This one was like 70, maybe.
[131:49.67]Or like 60.
[131:56.38]Does no post-credits scene.
[132:05.01]You said 100?
[132:06.15]It probably was.
[132:06.69]I don't know.
[132:07.27]I'm just trying to make myself feel better.
[132:11.65]Did I unlock the... Well, did you take a look at that?
[132:19.16]Showdown.
[132:22.53]I was so good at the game.
[132:23.41]Who was the best?
[132:28.23]I kind of like the combos.
[132:36.48]Oh, mission.
[132:37.22]You are hurt.
[132:37.98]Do not wait.
[132:40.24]This is just hard mode.
[132:42.10]Weapons hits cause more damage than normal.
[132:44.48]You are hurt.
[132:45.12]Do not take any more damage.
[132:46.64]Get to the next scene before time runs out.
[132:50.97]So this is one hit and you're dead.
[132:53.77]This is- everything does more damage and this is timed.
[132:56.35]Apparently we're doing this one.
[132:58.33]Let's see what happens.
[133:11.52]It's 30 seconds to get the- is it- do I have 30 seconds to beat the game?
[133:15.35]How is that possible?
[133:16.13]It's got a time crisis, isn't it?
[133:17.23]Let me just see what happens.
[133:23.72]Okay, so we have 16 seconds.
[133:36.86]I'm just curious.
[133:41.74]Yeah, alright.
[133:42.26]So you have a certain amount of time to beat every screen.
[133:45.06]That was fun.
[133:46.24]That was Dynamite Cop.
[133:49.30]Classic.
[133:50.40]I'm glad I played through it a few times.
[133:53.44]I'm gonna go ahead and turn this off so I don't, like, hurt anybody's eyes or anything.
[134:00.03]Next up, we've got... What do we got?
[134:07.21]There are a few options.
[134:10.81]We could do another survival horror.
[134:14.51]We could do... Alright, there's three categories, guys.
[134:19.37]There's game actually good.
[134:22.21]Survival horror or stupid?
[134:25.95]That's pretty much what's available.
[134:33.06]Do you want to go through a stupid one?
[134:36.22]Alright, we just did The Ring.
[134:39.02]That was survival horror.
[134:41.11]Then we did Dynamite Cop, which is good.
[134:43.59]So now we're going to go with The Floygan Brothers.
[134:50.09]Which I'm assuming is really stupid.
[134:55.17]The Floygan Brothers.
[134:56.13]Here we go.
[135:11.71]Did somebody just get 50 subs?
[135:16.11]The... TheOlaf1, thanks for the 50... 50 community subs.
[135:25.62]My god.
[135:26.28]Thank you so much, TheOlaf.
[135:36.81]Visual Concept!
[135:37.81]I don't like this company!
[135:40.37]I don't... What?
[135:41.25]I'm being taunted!
[135:45.84]Michael Flaygan!
[135:46.90]Sorry, I'm late.
[135:47.84]Michael, I was telling a joke.
[135:49.59]Oh, I love jokes, Michael.
[135:51.77]What was it?
[135:52.75]Oops, we're out of time.
[135:54.49]Welcome to the game.
[135:55.67]We're already hiding.
[136:03.59]The Flaygan Brothers.
[136:06.01]Episode one.
[136:08.41]Why?
[136:08.63]How is this episode one?
[136:10.13]Is this a whole series?
[136:11.55]Is this a TV show?
[136:14.57]But, honestly, thank you so much.
[136:16.63]A lot.
[136:17.93]The massive amount of community subs.
[136:19.49]That's fucking crazy.
[136:23.76]This is Ed, Edd n Eddy, Mario Brothers.
[136:27.46]And... Uh... The Walking Dead had a... No, it's not.
[136:32.82]The Walking Dead?
[136:50.77]Let's see.
[136:53.44]What's a six-letter word that means genius?
[136:56.72]Michael.
[136:57.70]Oh, yeah, good.
[136:59.74]Now, what's a seven-letter word that means circles of sugary baked dough with chocolate chips in them?
[137:06.71]Cookies.
[137:07.49]Let's make cookies.
[137:10.29]If we're gonna make cookies, we need sugar.
[137:12.45]Pass me the sugar bowl, Big Brother.
[137:14.53]It's on the table.
[137:15.29]That's a pretty good show.
[137:20.81]Do I just make cookies?
[137:22.57]I move around, do I get to be, I'm the, I'm the small boy, yeah, okay.
[137:26.95]I can already read the comments.
[137:30.33]Of course.
[137:32.71]Uh, I need the sugar, where is it?
[137:35.57]Right here?
[137:38.83]I can't reach the sugar.
[137:47.98]God, Parodian Weapon, 10 community subs.
[137:49.64]Thank you, Parodian Weapon.
[137:51.28]10 more!
[137:51.86]I bet it'd be tall enough to open this door.
[137:55.24]I was gonna say, no way.
[138:17.04]Can you point to the butter, Hoigle?
[138:19.34]I thought I was Floygan.
[138:23.04]Oh, no.
[138:24.00]It's Hoigan?
[138:25.58]Hoigle Floygan?
[138:27.82]Thanks, Hoigle.
[138:29.32]Hoigle Floygan.
[138:30.42]And what's the big brother's name?
[138:34.63]If these are going to be chocolate chip cookies, we should probably add some chocolate.
[138:44.51]Could you get the chocolate?
[138:48.40]I think, yeah, that is a talented voice actor, by the way.
[138:52.01]That's Frank.
[138:52.97]Was Frank Welker?
[138:54.39]Let me check the map.
[138:58.92]To get the chocolate, Hoigle should get Moigle.
[139:03.96]Moigle and Hoigle flogging.
[139:06.22]Then Hoigle should run around Moigle.
[139:08.93]If Hoigle runs fast enough, Moigle will get dizzy and faint.
[139:13.57]Then Hoigle can bounce on his belly like a trampoline to get to high places.
[139:19.05]Simple.
[139:19.91]People do it all the time.
[139:22.31]Sounds crazy, but it just might work.
[139:25.03]That's their catchphrase.
[139:33.99]Alright, I'm gonna make him dizzy.
[139:39.07]And then jump on his belly.
[139:40.15]That didn't work.
[139:44.78]Here you go!
[139:51.47]Moigle!
[140:00.87]I'm gonna... I'm gonna jump if you keep playing this.
[140:05.33]Don't!
[140:06.55]Easy.
[140:09.79]Ugh.
[140:14.47]Ugh.
[140:17.51]You wanted stupid.
[140:19.20]And I knew this was gonna be the worst one of the entire bundle.
[140:22.16]This is the worst game that I've purchased.
[140:23.90]The worst one.
[140:25.78]Ah, hmm.
[140:27.90]That's not true.
[140:28.38]This is a Dreamcast exclusive.
[140:30.02]You can't get this anywhere else.
[140:34.82]Our great-grandfather made that bowl and I broke it.
[140:39.24]Okay, there are... Hug.
[140:45.12]Give me a hug, you big lug.
[140:52.28]Thanks, Heidel.
[140:53.44]I needed that.
[140:57.85]So what's the inevitable issue that they both have to solve together instead of just baking cookies and being weirdos?
[141:07.49]The aliens land.
[141:10.65]The military shows up with the rifles or something.
[141:13.47]Like what?
[141:13.85]What is it?
[141:14.37]The aliens have the radar gun.
[141:18.73]What is it?
[141:30.96]Sounds like Otto from Otto's Big Adventure.
[141:34.36]I'm getting flashbacks.
[141:40.92]Get the cookies!
[141:44.48]Where's the oven mitt?
[141:48.30]The cookies are burning!
[141:49.42]I gotta get the oven!
[141:50.32]Where's- is it in here?
[141:59.50]It's gonna burn down.
[142:05.70]I don't know where it is.
[142:12.93]Moigle!
[142:33.85]Up here?
[142:36.99]This is gonna burn.
[142:40.39]Hoigo!
[142:41.91]Hoigo, the kitchen's on fire!
[142:43.65]It burns!
[142:44.45]Go, let's get in there again.
[142:50.37]He's dead.
[143:03.04]I love this game.
[143:04.30]That's... alright.
[143:05.58]So this is- I anger my little brother and he tries to hurt me.
[143:11.45]What?
[143:46.15]Bro's fighting.
[143:48.15]What happened to the cookies?
[143:49.31]Weren't we having a fun time?
[143:50.98]We're killing each other.
[143:59.02]You burned my cookies!
[144:00.37]Now I'm going to beat your face in.
[144:19.29]Call the cops?
[144:21.75]What's he doing?
[144:24.51]Here he comes.
[144:35.50]What does this even do?
[144:36.28]It stops him from hurting me?
[144:37.64]Because I stand on the don't hurt... What?
[144:48.64]Offer Moigle an apple when he's hungry.
[144:53.94]This is such a confusing brotherly relationship here.
[144:57.05]I have to teach him.
[144:57.65]What are the options to teach?
[144:58.85]Let's see.
[144:59.07]Teach high five.
[145:18.21]I lost points.
[145:19.57]Moigle will high five with one hand or ten with both hands.
[145:23.89]Use the analog stick to choose up, down, right, or left and press five for one hand or ten for two.
[145:29.09]Press go to start a help for... This is the oddest game I think I've ever played.
[145:50.09]So this actually was not a precursor to some larger scale story.
[145:54.79]I'm very interested though.
[146:04.22]I need to see how this plays out.
[146:06.70]So I taught him how to high five.
[146:16.83]Why is somebody like this using the oven?
[146:20.96]bribe what does he want me some points and I'll show you something how many points should I give him ten nine five for that many points you could have gotten a ride on the ferris wheel what nine for that many points you could have gotten an ice cream cone for that many points you could have gotten a car
[146:47.90]Does anybody understand what the hell is happening right now?
[147:00.68]He wants three.
[147:04.50]We're giving each other points.
[147:08.12]That's not a place where you should have... Wait, hold on.
[147:13.69]He just pulled...
[147:16.72]What is that?
[147:17.28]I don't think I want to touch that.
[147:20.54]What the fuck?
[147:22.60]This is not going to go anywhere.
[147:27.64]This goes in a circle, Moigan.
[148:01.97]Oh no, Moigle has lost control of the train.
[148:04.27]Run and dive to catch the handle of the back of Moigle's train.
[148:29.49]I don't have... I really don't have anything to say.
[148:34.61]How do I get on the train?
[148:49.15]At the back?
[148:50.71]But... The camera is... doesn't let me...
[148:58.09]Where are their parents?
[149:00.71]How old are they?
[149:14.86]They're like 40.
[149:16.82]And you're learning how to high five at 40?
[149:26.06]What do I mean by it's too late?
[149:44.02]I'm not sure what too late means.
[149:51.14]I'm not fast enough to follow any...
[149:56.03]Fucking god.
[150:05.35]I can't.
[150:06.61]You're going too fast.
[150:08.67]No, get off the ladder.
[150:19.86]Just fall off at this point.
[150:23.66]The camera can't be moved.
[150:38.87]Go bake cookies!
[150:41.93]I got it!
[151:02.79]That's how the adventure starts.
[151:04.03]They haven't been out of their house.
[151:07.01]They have no idea what the outside world looks like.
[151:09.29]They get, like, dropped off here.
[151:10.65]There's, like, a bunch of cookie batter.
[151:18.42]You've completed your Floygan Brothers training.
[151:21.38]Now on to the main episode, Moigle's Secret Project.
[151:24.08]Have fun playing games with Moigle!
[151:28.16]Here he comes.
[151:29.52]This is why we waited that long.
[151:43.43]He just picks him up and starts eating him.
[151:47.81]Is there a whole open world here?
[152:04.57]Grab some lettuce, Flannery.
[152:05.87]What are you building in there?
[152:30.74]What scary, twisted, fucking messed up device are you building inside of that shack?
[152:35.54]He wants a muffler, oil.
[152:36.84]He wants like kerosene and shit.
[152:37.88]What the hell are you doing in here, man?
[152:39.70]Uh-uh.
[153:02.77]Rope.
[153:03.25]Syringe.
[153:06.99]Moigle needs Hoigle's help to find seven parts to finish his secret project.
[153:11.65]Watch out.
[153:12.01]When Moigle's mood changes, there might be something new to do.
[153:14.55]Don't forget that the mice can help find things.
[153:20.62]Alright, uh... Wait.
[153:27.56]This is Pac-Man.
[153:30.60]This is the Pac-Man Adventures.
[153:38.67]It's just from a third-point perspective.
[153:42.55]This is unbelievable.
[153:43.33]Okay, hold on.
[153:44.19]How does this work?
[153:44.93]Alright.
[153:47.49]Go cry in that box.
[153:48.77]I'm gonna get Moigle sad.
[153:50.19]Okay.
[153:50.31]What do you like, Moigle?
[153:51.11]Can you, like, take care of this?
[153:52.97]Get wet?
[153:53.25]Me?
[154:05.65]Beat him up?
[154:06.17]No, that makes him mad, not sad.
[154:07.59]Alright, we got some... Oh, man.
[154:18.87]The mailbox.
[154:20.55]What is this one?
[154:22.43]Is this anger?
[154:22.93]No, this is unconscious.
[154:27.16]Hey, come here.
[154:32.87]I will, just a second, just pass out here for one second.
[154:36.53]Except, can I get over here?
[154:45.11]How can I... Maybe jump on him more than once.
[154:50.03]Bounce bounce.
[154:56.07]This is kind of interesting, it is fairly, this is actually pretty interesting, it is.
[155:00.17]I'm not sure how to get up there.
[155:04.64]Is there a double jump?
[155:07.66]No.
[155:08.20]Huh.
[155:11.02]I bet he do.
[155:11.52]Maybe be closer?
[155:17.06]Oh, he's gonna be angry.
[155:22.22]Alright, that's fine.
[155:29.84]Come on, follow me.
[155:30.56]Let's go to the mailbox.
[155:32.82]Is this the mailbox?
[155:37.22]The yellow switch opens the gate.
[155:39.14]But where is it?
[155:40.17]Mice, can you help me out here?
[155:41.41]What do I need?
[155:42.01]Look?
[155:44.39]Oh, there's the yellow switch.
[155:45.41]Thanks, mice.
[155:57.70]Hey, there's an item over there, Jerma.
[156:01.30]Okay, what do we got?
[156:04.30]Fruit?
[156:04.92]Oh, he eats these, right?
[156:05.86]Fruit?
[156:08.93]Will this make him happy?
[156:09.81]It's not gonna make him sad.
[156:11.25]Food?
[156:13.15]Wait, food is repulsive.
[156:14.27]Are you gonna eat it?
[156:15.65]I'm offering you an apple.
[156:38.74]There really is something fucked up going on here.
[156:45.93]I don't like help your strange brother build a dangerous thing in the shed.
[156:51.09]I don't like that.
[156:51.89]I don't like this game.
[157:05.83]Okay, well, we got the box.
[157:10.11]Five points though, right?
[157:10.99]Let's see, teach.
[157:14.25]What can I teach?
[157:15.23]Teach, lift up, R the W. Around the world, yo-yo.
[157:20.16]Let's teach.
[157:26.52]Teach him the F word.
[157:36.00]Uh... What the hell are you doing?
[157:41.00]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[157:41.88]Cancel.
[157:44.14]Teach around the world yo-yo.
[157:49.13]Ten points.
[157:52.63]I just had a piece of fruit right next to you.
[157:55.29]Oh, I'm gonna make him cry.
[158:05.39]Come here.
[158:06.49]Where's the cry box?
[158:10.64]Come here.
[158:11.70]Let's go.
[158:14.06]We're gonna make him cry, and then he's gonna open the cry box.
[158:18.25]Sure.
[158:18.41]Come on.
[158:37.90]Got it.
[158:39.80]Now what?
[158:46.78]He's filling the river because he's primed.
[158:51.40]Alright, you wanna play a game?
[158:52.30]What was the game you wanted to play?
[158:55.02]Play.
[158:55.40]We could play High Five, Hide and Seek, Running Race, Catch.
[158:58.76]I don't wanna play High Five.
[159:01.33]This is boring.
[159:02.13]Yeah, I know how to play.
[159:08.23]I'm an expert at this point.
[159:18.94]But this is getting me points.
[159:29.16]Yeah, this is not based on some original cartoon, this is just the game.
[159:38.57]There is no... but this is Episode 1.
[159:40.09]I'm gonna assume that they thought...
[159:44.11]Maybe there was a possibility that this would take off and they could make a bunch of stuff.
[159:49.77]Toys, TV shows.
[159:54.30]It's based on every cartoon.
[159:56.32]That is true.
[159:59.22]What is this?
[159:59.96]Oh, it's candy.
[160:01.52]Come here!
[160:04.55]Here, come here.
[160:05.79]Eat the candy.
[160:13.96]More points?
[160:14.90]Here.
[160:15.56]I was trying to throw it in his face.
[160:19.46]Whatever.
[160:19.78]Alright.
[160:20.22]Alright, anger!
[160:21.04]Here we go.
[160:56.49]There's the key.
[161:04.53]Alright, it's time to be fair.
[161:05.97]You ready to be fair?
[161:07.65]For a game that came out, like, 20 years ago.
[161:11.79]It was a Dreamcast exclusive.
[161:14.05]That sucks.
[161:16.59]This is a great game.
[161:17.55]Like, imagine 20 years ago.
[161:27.69]I thought that said, Moigle's children.
[161:34.63]I'm like, why?
[161:35.81]What is there?
[161:36.35]Why is this here?
[161:38.15]I was like, what the fuck?
[161:43.23]Oh my god.
[161:44.13]Oh, I gotta get out of this game.
[161:47.13]Moigle, help me plant seeds in my garden, okay?
[161:55.85]Like, from back here!
[161:57.33]It's so blurry!
[161:58.24]I just... Alright, what are we doing?
[162:04.36]You wanna... I had the plant already!
[162:13.72]I threw the plant.
[162:14.76]Where did it go?
[162:15.24]Did it... Did it come down here?
[162:30.43]What's this emotion over this way?
[162:33.59]Happy?
[162:36.60]Yeah, that's happy.
[162:37.38]Is he happy now?
[162:37.98]Did you know that the Texas Chainsaw film was based off of this?
[162:47.28]You know, I didn't know that.
[162:54.61]Punch?
[162:55.01]No, no, no, no.
[162:55.77]I'm going to teach you.
[163:00.06]Lift up.
[163:01.54]Hide and seek.
[163:04.00]I want to teach you around the world.
[163:05.44]Here, eat this then.
[163:07.96]Take it.
[163:08.26]Alright, now we can learn...
[163:28.84]Speak.
[163:29.38]Teach.
[163:30.62]Uh, around the world.
[163:34.06]The Floygan Chainsaw Massacre.
[163:35.92]I'm not sure what this does.
[163:37.48]Uh, isn't it around the world?
[163:39.04]You spin it around in a circle?
[163:58.38]Why is he doing this?
[164:01.10]Did he learn it?
[164:07.15]That's not around the world.
[164:18.98]Hold on.
[164:21.32]No.
[164:21.68]Insult.
[164:22.12]Scores.
[164:22.68]Play.
[164:23.14]Teach.
[164:23.84]Did you not do it?
[164:26.64]I guess that is what he did.
[164:28.38]Okay, how about... Can we do it now?
[164:30.88]Can we play now?
[164:31.92]No.
[164:44.32]No, we gotta... I'm almost... It's almost time to move on.
[164:48.76]It's getting close.
[164:50.52]But I kind of want to see one last thing.
[164:56.94]You think you can buy the rights to these characters?
[165:00.53]No, I don't think so.
[165:02.89]Oh, it's because he has a full tummy.
[165:13.78]Okay, I get it.
[165:15.00]Let's put it down.
[165:23.72]Maybe later.
[165:24.42]Give me another idea.
[165:26.46]I have to... Why do I have to bribe you with points to hug you?
[165:32.03]I can't sit... It's a game... A competition that we're playing against each other.
[165:39.57]Alright, come on.
[165:40.97]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[165:42.13]So what does this open?
[165:52.76]Uh...
[166:01.79]Swipe?
[166:02.23]What am I supposed to grab?
[166:03.73]This water is like poison.
[166:28.59]Alright, I think that's enough of the Floygen Brothers.
[166:32.82]Keep play- I can't keep playing this.
[166:34.66]This is the- I don't- I can't play the Floygan brothers for like another 30 minutes.
[166:41.45]Keep playing.
[166:42.45]Ugh.
[166:43.63]Really?
[166:44.05]You want to see more Floygan?
[166:47.55]This game sucks.
[166:49.87]I'm- I didn't say that.
[166:54.39]More Floygan.
[166:57.64]I did open this though.
[166:59.92]No, I didn't.
[167:00.76]Hey!
[167:02.94]Go get that.
[167:03.66]Go open the gate.
[167:16.99]You can't do it?
[167:19.05]We need more Floygan.
[167:24.99]No, you definitely don't want more Floygan.
[167:32.54]Okay, so somebody has to be standing here already.
[167:35.46]Stand here.
[167:38.57]Get over here.
[167:42.05]Right there.
[167:42.41]I just got rejected.
[167:54.65]Gotta be fast, like me.
[167:56.13]Okay, so I get it.
[167:57.44]Come here.
[167:57.76]Come get a hug.
[167:58.64]I'm gonna open this gate, we're gonna see what's in here.
[168:00.32]Why am I still playing Floygan?
[168:07.12]No, it's not a hug.
[168:10.24]No shit, I just punched him in the stomach.
[168:15.90]The polls are in, it's a steal.
[168:17.38]I don't have any mo- I can't bribe him!
[168:18.92]I used all my- I used all my brother points!
[168:30.74]I have to play a game to build up points.
[168:35.24]Alright, we're almost done.
[168:36.48]Trust me.
[168:43.07]Spam the pole.
[168:44.75]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[168:46.53]We're going to be... Now it's a timer.
[168:51.25]It's a timer.
[168:51.85]Alright.
[168:58.53]This is some resident sleep.
[169:04.17]That was one guy though.
[169:05.77]That was one guy.
[169:06.81]He's trying to bait me.
[169:18.50]I had one or two seconds to do that.
[169:21.88]How many points did I get?
[169:25.24]One.
[169:30.83]Hey, sailor.
[169:31.99]Give me a hug.
[169:33.07]Let's do something else.
[169:37.42]Maybe later.
[169:38.15]Give me another idea.
[170:02.41]It'll be two.
[170:03.39]And then we can get in the gate.
[170:10.87]And then at twenty-five seasons from now, we're gonna find out what's in that basement.
[170:19.66]I've had the key around my neck for about seven years now.
[170:36.57]Give me a hug.
[170:39.99]Let's go.

[172:41.99]Minus 500 viewers.
[172:45.31]We're almost done with Hoigl and Moigl.
[172:55.99]I think, how many times do I have to catch the dog?
[173:02.51]I'm not even fast enough to do it once.
[173:04.81]Not at once.
[173:05.78]How many times?
[173:07.00]This is Super Mario.
[173:28.96]Restore.
[173:29.38]That's Heugl and Moigl.
[173:58.38]The Moigle Brothers.
[173:59.46]I don't even know what it was called.
[174:01.22]It's called The Moigle Brothers.
[174:02.64]Now this one I am excited for.
[174:09.46]I can't wait to play this one.
[174:12.58]I don't even think this is a Dreamcast exclusive.
[174:15.26]I just saw it and I said, okay, I think I need to have this.
[174:19.70]I have to own this.
[174:24.72]It's not Crazy Taxi.
[174:26.00]It is...
[174:28.60]You'll see.
[174:30.84]It's not Seaman.
[174:31.82]I had to return Seaman because they forgot to put the mic in the box.
[174:38.77]This is ECW Anarchy Rules.
[174:45.36]I'm excited.
[175:07.03]Louder, louder.
[175:08.61]There's a dumpster match in this.
[175:10.91]That's all I needed to see.
[175:13.29]That's the first thing I'm gonna do, and it's probably the last thing I'm gonna do.
[175:22.38]DCW don't even exist anymore.
[175:27.82]It was absorbed a long time ago.
[175:32.32]Blood and guts.
[175:34.51]Yeah, they used to, like, throw each other on fluorescent light bulbs.
[175:36.95]Used to, like, jump off buildings.
[175:42.69]And... See?
[175:52.11]That guy got hit, actually hit the head with a rock.
[176:00.64]And then had it fell to his hand.

[176:46.66]Insufficient space!
[176:49.96]Pay-per-view needs 93 blocks.
[176:52.76]Wait, what, how?
[176:54.44]What's on here?
[176:56.82]Fraudian weapon thanks to the 10 community subs.
[176:58.45]10 more!
[177:06.45]You know this is the first place we're going.
[177:08.21]You gotta... There's no way there's something on here.
[177:21.55]That's impossible.
[177:25.26]No.
[177:27.74]No, there's nothing on here.
[177:33.41]Create.
[177:35.59]Body.
[177:39.41]Loading screens for every single one.
[177:44.01]Mail.
[177:44.45]Oh, my God.
[177:47.23]That's very, very large.
[177:55.50]It's not...
[178:02.63]How skinny can they get?
[178:09.75]Let's go with muscle.
[178:15.09]Hairy?
[178:17.30]Scarred?
[178:18.06]Bruised?
[178:18.94]Cut?
[178:20.88]Diseased?
[178:22.66]Okay.
[178:23.12]Let's go with rib.
[178:31.70]How do I select the color?
[178:37.67]What's the... How do I make him... How do I make him, like, green?
[178:48.02]Yeah, make Thanos?
[178:50.04]That's not a bad idea.
[178:55.50]It is loading so heavily.
[179:09.97]What does Thanos have for eyes?
[179:10.95]Nope.
[179:11.43]That's my eyes.
[179:12.71]That's not bad.
[179:13.45]You can't control him.
[179:14.67]This is a very early character creator, so...
[179:40.23]Mouth.
[179:40.99]Got kind of a large mouth.
[179:42.17]Oh, there we go.
[179:43.53]Getting there.
[179:45.15]22.
[179:45.23]Looks kind of like it could be.
[179:46.27]No.
[179:47.53]22.
[179:47.71]22's probably the closest.
[179:52.64]No.
[179:52.82]Hold on.
[180:21.56]Remus.
[180:22.56]There we go.
[180:24.48]Mouth 12.
[180:27.65]Oh.
[180:29.75]Why does mouth 11 have to not be... Come on.
[180:31.71]Go the other way.
[180:32.67]Vertical.
[180:37.82]That's not bad either.
[180:51.10]But he doesn't have the lines going down.
[180:53.24]Ugh.
[181:00.99]No, Thanos doesn't have hair.
[181:06.15]No, none.
[181:10.06]No, but maybe Goatee would look a little better?
[181:16.04]No, this is the real way to do this, guys.
[181:20.07]I'm making the goatee purple.
[181:44.10]Almost.
[181:46.30]Look at that.
[181:48.66]That's pretty close.
[181:55.91]alright mask what do you have no no mask right but wait wait wait wait no no designs accessories head gear does he have anything on his head or on his ears or anything no
[182:31.29]Okay, upper body.
[182:32.11]He doesn't have clothes, does he?
[182:38.71]What is he, what is Thanos, he wears armor.
[182:41.73]It's like gold armor, right?
[182:44.76]That's pretty good.
[183:10.44]Add-ons.
[183:12.66]Don't need any add-ons.
[183:16.84]Chest gear.
[183:17.56]Oh, wait a minute.
[183:18.14]There's armor.
[183:20.64]Bulletproof chest armor.
[183:22.50]Gold.
[183:27.82]Shoulder pads.
[183:28.34]There we go.
[183:30.83]Shoulder pads look okay.
[183:43.39]The whole thing can't come on.
[183:44.65]It's going to be.
[183:53.81]That's annoying.
[183:58.78]Take off the shirt.
[184:10.77]No, he's got nothing on his arm.
[184:13.65]Take the shirt off, that's what it looks like.
[184:22.92]He's just wearing, like, a children's section t-shirt.
[184:26.65]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[184:32.47]Gloves.
[184:38.75]One glove.
[184:40.37]That's... Come on.
[184:48.44]That's really cool.
[184:50.56]Nice one glove.
[184:56.34]Accessories?
[185:00.00]Oh, wait, we can make it!
[185:00.98]I think we can make it.
[185:02.68]That's pretty close.
[185:04.18]Hold on.
[185:09.68]Because that will... Yeah, that's as good as it's going to be.
[185:21.15]We got a big gold.
[185:23.42]I'm not sure you even can.
[185:32.70]Give him a corsage.
[185:36.75]How is this yellow?
[185:46.27]Okay.
[185:49.27]Well, there is kind of yellow.
[185:53.28]My mood bracelet.
[185:57.02]Well, alright.
[186:02.68]It was back here.
[186:04.60]Somehow.
[186:09.06]Why is it doing this?
[186:14.23]This is ugly.
[186:18.28]It doesn't even matter.
[186:18.94]He's getting thrown in the dumpster in about five minutes anyways.
[186:21.92]That's okay.
[186:22.36]That's all the Infinity Stones are activating at the same time.
[186:29.18]He's got the Mood Infinity Gauntlet.
[186:35.63]Where's the stupid glove?
[186:37.79]One glove.
[186:38.17]There it is.
[186:43.51]Mood Gauntlet.
[186:55.96]This thing sucks.
[186:58.95]Ew.
[186:59.29]Mood gauntlet?
[186:59.99]Infinity gauntlet?
[187:02.05]Or is he just wearing like a gushers?
[187:06.17]He just squashed a bunch of gushers and taped them together and put it on his arm.
[187:13.21]He's wearing like a candy bracelet.
[187:23.64]Okay.
[187:26.89]A little bit darker.
[187:32.69]Somebody's saying the chest is wrong.
[187:41.33]Add-ons, right?
[187:47.15]So what, it needs to be black?
[187:57.34]Give him a vest.
[188:02.05]This is the shittiest Thanos.
[188:04.71]Come on, it was 2001, guys.
[188:07.83]I can't make a perfect Thanos.
[188:22.21]This is actually kind of the best he wears.
[188:28.89]This one, right here.
[188:30.39]That's it.
[188:36.93]What color is the vest?
[188:49.84]Black, black, black, black.
[188:55.80]Oh, who cares?
[189:02.37]Use buckles?
[189:10.52]Alright, buckles.
[189:11.83]Black.
[189:15.63]He doesn't have sleeves.
[189:33.80]Guys, it's not going to happen.
[189:38.87]I don't even know what he looks like.
[189:40.43]Hold on.
[189:40.81]I didn't see that movie.
[189:41.79]Let me just look it up.
[189:44.65]Oh, Thanos.
[189:50.04]Okay, so this is pretty... He doesn't have sleeves.
[189:54.28]It doesn't matter.
[189:56.04]I already had it.
[189:56.94]It was already done.
[189:57.90]The vest doesn't need to be on here.
[190:10.71]That's pretty close already.
[190:13.91]Alright, what does he have for pants?
[190:19.05]That's good.
[190:23.27]OK, and boots.
[190:24.87]OK.
[190:42.72]Looking good.
[190:46.12]They're not blue.
[190:56.49]Alright, that's it.
[190:57.37]Accessories, that's good.
[190:58.57]We're good.
[190:59.67]Wait, wait, wait.
[191:00.59]I gotta put socks on, though.
[191:02.69]Oh, shit.
[191:03.45]I don't want those.
[191:07.70]There he is.
[191:09.28]Text.
[191:11.30]Rant.
[191:12.02]Oh!
[191:15.34]Okay.
[191:16.56]We're done.
[191:21.20]What is Thanos' real name?
[191:22.92]Does he have a real name?
[191:44.71]No, it's just one name.
[191:48.35]Okay, Attributes.
[191:51.55]Let's do this correct.
[191:56.87]So, I would say for Charisma, like a 1.
[192:00.66]Recovery.
[192:02.64]Speed.
[192:03.50]Toughness.
[192:04.80]Okay, he's tough, he's strong, he's very fast.
[192:13.45]Maybe his mat skills might not be great because he's not used to being in a ring.
[192:16.07]That's pretty good.
[192:22.95]They need to be balanced.
[192:24.15]No, uh... I don't even know who any of these... Uh, DeVito.

[195:16.08]Come on, admit it.
[195:17.48]You're jealous.
[195:18.94]So what if I'm a girl?
[195:20.50]There will be no appeal.
[195:21.70]The shorter they are, the harder they fall.
[195:24.88]I hate this.
[195:25.68]I believe in this match.
[195:27.20]You're the joke.
[195:28.80]Why didn't we make Loki?
[195:30.77]I believe in this match.
[195:32.29]You're the joke.
[195:33.39]You're about to get macked by the kid.
[195:35.43]With the dangerous alliance in my stable.

[195:53.88]I'm not wasting my time with crap like you.
[195:56.60]I'm going to show you why I'm the original gangster.
[195:59.59]You might think you're good, but I'm super.
[196:03.09]This match ain't going to make a best of tape.
[196:05.61]After I take you out, I'm going to take your old lady out and show her why they call me.
[196:10.37]Brother, I'm the American dream.
[196:12.78]Chicken.
[196:14.87]It's time for everybody's favorite wrestler.
[196:18.93]Simon says I'm more intelligent.
[196:22.09]Simon says I'm more intelligent.
[196:25.01]Simon says you need some discipline.
[196:27.82]I am the Sandman, the hardcore icon.
[196:31.50]Left ear.
[196:32.60]Oh, it was only in the left ear?
[196:35.68]Hold on, I gotta put my left ear in.
[196:42.52]Simon says, I'm more intelligent than you are.
[196:46.48]Oh yeah, it was just one ear.
[196:49.53]You can't beat me.
[196:50.81]I'm from Calgary, Alberta, Canada.
[196:53.97]I'm the original giant.
[196:55.55]I'm gonna leave the broadcast booth just to kick your ass.
[196:59.10]Good night, Chesty, wherever you are.
[197:00.30]You're a good faggot.
[197:14.25]What three-year-old was in the extreme championship wrestling?
[197:21.42]What?
[197:24.66]You're just begging.
[197:28.13]Where was there a child?
[197:30.49]I'm Prodigy, son of the Great One.
[197:33.65]Your head is so tiny.
[197:36.89]You're just another speed bump in my push to the top.
[197:41.76]Tonight, when you scream, it had better be in tune.
[197:45.68]Oh, man.
[197:46.46]I'm gonna take this fist and shove it down your throat.
[197:50.52]I may look like an underdog, but don't let that fool you.
[197:53.52]I've got a tremendous bite.
[197:55.77]Be forewarned.
[197:57.17]My capacity for violence has yet to be ascertained.
[198:01.41]Look, it's Pagan.
[198:03.92]Morty.
[198:04.04]Morty.
[198:04.16]And Rick is like right here.
[198:04.76]That's fucking hilarious.
[198:05.84]Okay.
[198:05.94]Save.
[198:42.57]Okay, S-A, whatever.
[198:44.92]Wrestler name, Thanos.
[198:51.26]Change... I don't care.
[198:54.80]Go back and do the hit sounds?
[199:03.61]This kid?
[199:06.33]Hold on.
[199:08.95]Name, attributes, moves, personality.
[199:11.81]Fighting style.
[199:14.91]The Kid.
[199:18.77]Theme song, The Kid.
[199:20.09]What is The Kid's theme song, then?
[199:21.57]I think we just glazed over it completely.
[199:27.93]The Kid.
[199:49.86]Voice grunts the kid, the kid, the kid.
[199:52.78]I just... Okay, on the right.
[200:08.58]Have the kid be the run-in partner.
[200:10.22]Well, we don't... I don't know how to play the game yet.
[200:12.77]We gotta get there first.
[200:14.33]Hold on.
[200:25.35]Create!
[200:26.07]Okay, that's it.
[200:28.91]Create a pay-per-view.
[200:31.43]Edit stadium.
[200:33.36]Hold on, let me just see.
[200:34.18]No, this is all dumb, right?
[200:37.00]Interim sign, scaffold, ban?
[200:41.72]Alright, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[200:47.04]Exhibition.
[200:49.57]One-on-one, lumberjack, battle royale, hate match, team rumble, stable match.
[201:01.23]Eight-man tag.
[201:02.21]Can I change the rules?
[201:05.46]Battle Royale?
[201:06.38]What the hell is that?
[201:11.94]Look at these emotes.
[201:13.90]Alright, hold on.
[201:15.56]Where's the kid?
[201:20.24]No.
[201:24.35]There's no kid.
[201:26.23]There's no the kid.
[201:37.15]Um, okay, so we're gonna do the trainer.
[201:40.64]So I'm just gonna be... Thin.
[201:43.56]Okay.
[201:44.00]So, order list.
[202:20.60]Wait, how many can I have in here?
[202:23.54]Wait, why is this so many?
[202:30.23]Match options.
[202:34.03]Match options.
[202:35.13]None.
[202:35.71]I can't change that.
[202:41.79]I don't understand.
[202:50.11]None.
[202:50.45]I can't see.
[202:50.89]It's just a battle royale.
[202:52.67]Windmonger fire is none.
[202:53.85]Belt channel is none.
[202:55.99]Simulation on.
[202:58.77]Is it just a rumble?
[203:01.42]Brick.
[203:03.80]No one landed.
[203:05.60]TKO.
[203:06.66]Off.
[203:13.99]This is just a bootleg rumble.
[203:15.81]It is.
[203:17.53]I think I want to play though, maybe not.
[203:19.07]Let's just go.
[203:20.33]See what happens.
[203:36.09]Thanos is, yes he is, Thanos is right here.
[203:45.88]Are there no entrances?
[203:56.38]You're just another speed bump in my push to the top.
[204:02.09]I hate this already.
[204:03.35]I don't like it.
[204:04.03]I really don't.
[204:12.55]Body slam?
[204:13.51]Wrestlers around the world use that move.
[204:30.09]I wanna play.
[204:31.59]The commentator is still on.
[204:46.54]I wanna play.
[204:49.18]I wanna play.
[204:55.00]Where's the crowd?
[204:56.42]Why is there no audience sounds?
[205:11.77]They keep doing low blows to me.
[205:16.37]That's supposed to be an audience member.
[205:23.39]So I wonder what the entrance is like for the kid.
[205:30.43]There's no music either.
[205:36.85]How do you lose?
[205:37.55]Do you have to get thrown over the top rope?
[205:43.38]Because only four people are allowed in here at one time, and there's 30 that are supposed to be here.
[205:50.00]This is going to take a very... I think we have to do something else.
[206:17.23]I'm not sure if this is going to be a win or a loss.
[206:35.68]Exhibition?
[206:37.69]Versus?
[206:39.27]Hold on, one-on-one, right?
[206:42.51]Or, three-way dance?
[206:48.78]Between me, the trainer, and... That's victory.
[207:00.62]This guy.
[207:01.72]Match options.
[207:02.40]Deathmatch.
[207:03.02]Barbed wire dumpster match.
[207:04.70]That's what I'm talking about.
[207:06.95]Brimstone match.
[207:08.53]Dumpster match.
[207:09.77]Wind modifiers.
[207:17.12]Simulation on... No, off.
[207:21.14]I wanna play.
[207:24.24]Alright, let's go.
[207:24.72]This is a dumpster match.
[207:40.64]Where are the entrances?
[207:41.50]There's no entrance?
[207:54.54]This is not the entrance.
[207:55.72]No, it is not.
[207:58.20]My goat took my gimmick.
[208:01.94]I'm gonna knock you out cold with the orange bomb and then finish you off with the trainer saw.
[208:08.59]Oh my god.
[208:09.85]I've proved in the past that being a champion wasn't a fluke.
[208:12.75]Now you get to experience my skills as a man.
[208:15.05]No, Morty.
[208:15.65]Morty.
[208:16.89]Let's go.
[208:26.18]How does dumpster match work?
[208:28.28]Do you have to get thrown in the dumpster?
[208:29.86]That's block, okay.
[208:54.47]Can you guys fight each other?
[208:55.33]This is supposed to be a fatal three-way.
[208:56.77]Can I go outside?
[209:03.07]How do you leave?
[209:04.52]Okay, that's run.
[209:05.28]Let's go use the dumpster.
[209:19.33]They're not just gonna keep doing this, are they?
[209:21.27]Oh, you figured it out.
[209:22.91]Good.
[209:23.05]How do I change who I want to look at?
[209:50.64]You morons need to shut your mouth!
[209:55.77]These are not Mold Blows.
[210:00.09]Don't give me that.
[210:00.75]There's a... That Anos.
[210:05.75]Bitch.
[210:17.10]Why?
[210:18.12]How does this match work?
[210:24.72]They won't fight each other.
[210:26.64]They're just going to fight me, which is bullshit on its own right.
[210:33.99]I'm going to lose.
[210:35.25]I'm almost out of health.
[210:37.47]You can't pin me.
[210:38.35]There's no pinning.
[210:47.74]It's over!
[210:49.16]I lost.
[210:50.16]I got put in the dumpster.
[211:09.01]Who's bleeding?
[211:09.87]Why is there blood all over the ground?
[211:13.76]Can I get out?
[211:16.45]I think I'm just in here.
[211:17.15]I think I lose.
[211:17.87]That's it.
[211:31.12]Why am I dead?
[211:32.02]We have to do Brimstone after this.
[211:36.92]I need to know what that's like.
[211:39.14]Oh!
[211:50.90]The disk just had to load to pull that audio off.
[211:57.17]Looks like the trainer is going to beat an actual wrestler.
[212:01.05]This game has a 38 on Metacritic.
[212:10.91]Even back then.
[212:17.50]Alright, I don't know how much more I can take of this.
[212:28.93]It's a different weight category.
[212:31.37]That might be true.
[212:32.01]They only have 5 minutes and 45 seconds to finish this.
[212:45.37]Most of the sounds in this game are just diarrhea cramp noises.
[212:49.44]Top wrist lock!
[212:52.04]Against the ropes!
[212:58.54]Off the ropes!
[212:59.48]What's... How... His back?
[213:01.38]There's nothing on his shoulder.
[213:04.23]He landed on his shoulder.
[213:05.13]He's bleeding.
[213:07.67]How come all you wrestlers suck, Vader?
[213:21.50]I think this is the end.
[213:26.28]No, you just throw him in the dumpster.
[213:28.34]That's all you have to do.
[213:29.26]You don't have to do anything else.
[213:35.49]Oh, he's red.
[213:36.11]Speaking of red.
[213:40.05]La Cranda just gave a hundred dollars.
[213:44.35]La Cranda, thank you so much for the hundred bucks.
[213:48.93]Hey Jeremy, remember me?
[213:49.69]It's time for some free shit.
[213:51.95]The bounce off the ropes!
[213:54.43]Yeah, it gets... I... Okay.
[214:00.87]That's over.
[214:02.42]Uh... But thank you, Lakronda.
[214:06.30]Those of you that... Those of you that don't know what he's talking about... There's, uh... There's an extreme amount of money that was given two days ago.
[214:20.79]It was one of the most outrageous things I've ever had on stream for monetarily.
[214:24.73]It was ridiculous.
[214:27.07]Thank you.
[214:29.79]I don't know what this means.
[214:30.55]Do you know how to do the secret poo move?
[214:36.34]I don't want to do a poo move.
[214:41.02]How about not lumberjack?
[214:42.88]Four-way dance.
[214:45.12]And can I do brimstone?
[214:54.25]No, let me just do one-on-one, one-on-one.
[215:03.29]Hate match.
[215:05.47]Death match, cage match, street fight, barbed wire, dumpster, table, brimstone, rage in the cage, backlot, brawl.
[215:18.04]Street fight?
[215:18.88]Let's try street fight.
[215:30.96]Does the arena matter?
[215:43.19]Isn't Street Fight just a match with weapons, is it?
[215:46.84]Oh shit, it might be.
[216:06.44]I'm not sure what's very childlike about this.
[216:09.00]I would do this if I was in the ring.
[216:16.60]Okay.
[216:23.54]I did trainer again, didn't I?
[216:29.84]He's just gonna walk.
[216:41.51]No.
[216:44.61]Do it again.
[216:45.03]Same thing.
[216:45.37]Do it again.
[216:45.68]Alright.
[216:55.82]Wrestling is not real.
[216:58.87]You're just another speedball.
[217:00.79]He said, wrestling's not real.
[217:03.11]So there's punch, kick, and then there's a grapple.
[217:07.97]Vertical suplex.
[217:10.18]That's grapple, and it's up... Yeah, okay.
[217:12.44]So that's how that works.
[217:13.16]Hammerlock!
[217:13.96]Reverse that move!
[217:16.13]And I reversed it.
[217:18.65]How are these street rules?
[217:21.59]Arm wrench!
[217:22.49]Wrestlers around the world use that move!
[217:24.61]Where are the weapons?
[217:29.11]Hip toss!
[217:32.08]Hammerlock!
[217:36.34]Um, I seem to only know how to do the arm wrench.
[217:39.20]Arm wrench!
[217:45.27]Oh, there we go.
[217:45.79]You have to go up in a direction, left in a direction.
[217:48.53]Okay, I get it.
[217:49.23]He's the Infinity Gauntlet.
[218:04.65]Give me a goddamn weapon.
[218:06.43]That's smart.
[218:07.21]Take it to the outside.
[218:14.44]Look at the crowd.
[218:24.21]Do you reach underneath?
[218:27.80]How do you... I want to pick up something from... Take it all the way out?
[218:37.90]Can I reach in the crowd?
[218:39.79]Most of the games allow you to reach in the crowd.
[218:41.63]Nope.
[218:44.96]Can't go back that way.
[218:45.84]Fantastic!
[218:50.65]Yeah!
[218:51.79]Hammerlock?
[218:52.69]Jesus.
[218:54.31]What the fuck can I even do?
[219:05.18]Alright, we're gonna... Street fight!
[219:13.92]I'm not seeing much street, and I'm not seeing much of a fight either.
[219:27.23]Win location anywhere move list.
[219:30.55]Hip toss, body slam, spinning DDT.
[219:46.52]Alright, this is really kind of boring, actually.
[219:53.33]We're going to do a brimstone match.
[219:57.71]It needs to be like a bunch of fire or something.
[220:02.37]Four-way dance and a brimstone.
[220:03.55]Doesn't matter.
[220:04.41]Brimstone.
[220:04.98]Here we go.
[220:07.66]Let's go.
[220:19.38]Moigen and Floigen had superior combat mechanics.
[220:31.61]Alright, got interesting.
[220:32.41]Remember how excited I was for this?
[220:36.98]I know.
[220:37.86]What a... This is a bust.
[220:39.68]Unfortunately.
[220:40.30]I'm gonna say a... Look, I'm gonna say a funny baby line and then we can move on.
[220:47.90]My goat took my gimmick.
[220:53.70]Against the ropes!
[220:59.45]Finally, somebody's not fighting me.
[221:00.81]How do I go up?
[221:02.79]Can you not go up?
[221:06.45]Hip toss!
[221:07.39]I've even seen fans do that move!
[221:16.01]It's just fire out there.
[221:17.11]You can't go outside.
[221:20.44]Arm wrench?
[221:30.64]Yeah.
[221:32.30]Hell, this is not fun.
[221:35.00]It could have been.
[221:35.62]Have potential.
[221:38.21]But unless I see somebody burn here.
[221:40.63]Player one is down and he's hurt.
[221:49.30]Can I only have- how many- I only have two moves?
[222:06.72]So what's the point of the PNG outside around the edge?
[222:10.21]Is there no point to that?
[222:18.80]There's just a blinking bitmap in there.
[222:20.64]Why am I doing this?
[222:24.90]They're all against me.
[222:31.14]Somebody fight somebody else, please!
[222:35.66]What's with this guy and everyone being able to do every move?
[222:50.30]Oh, you know, hip toss.
[222:55.75]My grandmother can do that.
[222:57.41]DDT?
[222:58.49]Oh, fans can do that.
[223:01.19]Come on.
[223:01.83]Reverse that.
[223:07.59]Hip toss.
[223:12.62]Into the rope.
[223:13.34]The bounce off the rope.
[223:15.16]It's not as easy as you think.
[223:17.50]I've left their aggro range like four times.
[223:25.58]Get away from me, please.
[223:30.21]He's wide open.
[223:37.71]This game makes me nauseous.
[223:39.61]I didn't like that sound.
[223:42.07]That was a very, very bad sound.
[223:48.93]Look.
[223:50.33]Is there any move that this guy doesn't think is not impressive?
[224:00.36]I just light me on fire, and so I can be done with this.
[224:11.60]Player one can't keep his hands up.
[224:13.34]Who's going to throw me over?
[224:14.14]Who's going to burn me?
[224:16.30]Come on, trainer!
[224:22.41]There's no... Why are you pinning?
[224:25.63]I stuck away.
[224:27.55]He's... There is nobody there.
[224:30.83]Oh, ref, that's like a 12 count.
[224:35.83]Come on, guys.
[224:36.65]You can do better than that.
[224:43.18]Still pinning.
[224:45.62]He doesn't get it.
[224:46.44]He still thinks I'm under there.
[225:00.45]Hammerlock!
[225:04.37]That's one of the first moves you're taught as a young wrestler.
[225:08.93]Are they doing... Are they...
[225:14.42]Somebody kill me.
[225:16.66]Just kill me already.
[225:21.02]Can I just drop a cinder block on this guy's head or something?
[225:23.73]Seriously, the guy that's lying down.
[225:26.67]Can't a stage light fall and hit him in the skull?
[225:29.95]The trainer.
[225:30.85]Nice vertical suplex.
[225:34.01]What an escape.
[225:35.14]That wasn't supposed to hurt, was it?
[225:40.10]Come back where you're going.
[225:41.04]Fine, trainer!
[225:55.79]Why don't you get in the ring?
[226:06.31]Nobody can go outside.
[226:07.39]It's actually just not even... It's there for show.
[226:12.32]Brimstone match is just to keep you in the ring.
[226:17.02]There's no cool effect.
[226:18.54]There's no fire.
[226:19.96]It's just there.
[226:36.20]I'm just waiting for somebody to throw me over the edge.
[226:40.57]That doesn't work.
[226:41.47]That doesn't do anything.
[226:42.53]Alright, that's it.
[226:43.89]I'm out of here.
[226:51.68]That's... It actually was just like a PNG.
[227:20.04]I just need, I just, I'll just wait, wait, wait, wait, calm down, calm down, wait, wait, wait, trust me, trust me.
[227:33.11]Hi mom.
[227:34.03]See, look.
[227:38.75]Here comes a much needed beating.
[227:44.95]Is this it?
[227:45.35]Is this all?
[227:45.69]It's back here?
[227:46.73]Yes!
[227:47.61]Arm wrench!
[227:48.63]He really seized an opportunity there.
[227:50.60]There's nothing else there, right?
[227:58.38]God damn it, what a bust.
[227:59.25]That's so disappointing.
[228:05.31]What a bust.
[228:05.89]What an actual bust.
[228:14.38]Alright, we got... We got Tony Hawk 2 coming up here.
[228:19.76]Either Tony Hawk 2 or... No, wait, this one.
[228:23.68]This one's going to be fucking fantastic.
[228:25.81]I can't wait to play this one.
[228:31.69]Hear me out on this one.
[228:35.01]We got Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2, but I feel like I need to end on that one because I'm going to play it for at least an hour or two, right?
[228:43.26]Let me...
[228:49.57]I don't know.
[228:49.91]This is tricky.
[228:52.52]We'll see.
[228:52.84]We don't have to do all of them in one day.
[228:56.46]These can happen over the course of a few days.
[228:58.40]Over the course of like a week or so.
[229:01.65]In the meantime, just give me a second.
[229:03.23]I want to grab water.
[229:04.65]It's been about four hours and I want to grab something to drink.
[229:06.85]I'll be right back.
[231:59.92]So coming up now is... This is a game about evolution.
[232:30.03]From the description, those of you that have ever played Warcraft 3, there's a game mode, a custom game mode that used to exist.
[232:41.22]It was called Evolution, where you had to eat and grow and eat other things and other players.
[232:50.35]You could transform into other things.
[232:54.85]No, not Spore, not Spore.
[232:58.13]It's called Darwin's Island, is what it was called.
[233:02.23]And I begged, BEGGED for an actual, real, developed version of that game.
[233:12.07]And we got it.
[233:13.13]In 1998.
[233:13.41]Five years before Darwin's Island was ever made.
[233:20.52]Sorry about that loud noise.
[233:31.33]The story is fiction and in resemblance to actual names or historical facts is coincidental.
[233:53.53]Anything else?
[233:54.03]Is it voiceover or something?
[233:57.17]Nothing?
[233:59.43]Is it Mars?
[234:11.96]Back 60, 70 million years ago, Mars turns into Venus.
[234:21.25]Got a full motion video cutscene.
[234:27.25]Are they gonna be real actors?
[234:28.83]I hope so.
[234:42.06]A nice gentle rain falling on the terrain.
[234:52.05]You start as like a little tadpole.
[234:54.59]And you can grow to be as big as that mountain.
[235:00.84]How did they get video 70 million years ago?
[235:04.16]I have no idea.
[235:08.91]Probably some Rick and Morty episode.
[235:11.83]Seventh Cross.
[235:25.09]That was very... Melee missile?
[235:29.22]Random missile?
[235:29.96]What does that mean?
[235:32.60]Is that a relaxing thing to say?
[235:36.34]By the way, I can't save.
[235:37.56]What the hell is even on this?
[235:48.03]Should I stop removing shit from the VMU?
[235:56.67]You barely understand what the game is?
[235:58.17]Don't worry.
[236:00.28]It will be- all will be revealed.
[236:05.14]Here are six boards.
[236:06.14]Select a more appropriate color for each board from balls above.
[236:09.56]Is he saying rats?
[236:13.58]He's saying rats.
[236:17.52]He went, Rats.
[236:19.10]Rats.
[236:21.35]Oh, no.
[236:21.87]Fuck, he's doing the colors.
[236:22.69]Never mind.
[236:26.75]This board signifies offense.
[236:29.05]Press the A button when you have selected a color.
[236:33.55]No, what?
[236:42.55]What does the color have to do with anything?
[236:43.90]For offense.
[236:45.98]Blue offense.
[236:47.88]Water.
[236:49.34]Fire.
[236:50.22]Water.
[236:51.68]Lightning.
[236:53.36]Poison.
[236:54.86]Holy.
[236:56.27]Decay.
[236:57.33]I'm not sure which one I want.
[236:58.35]I think I'm gonna go with poison.
[237:12.85]Okay, what's this one signify?
[237:14.27]This board signifies PSI power.
[237:17.21]Pounds per square inch.
[237:18.33]Press the A button when you have selected a color.
[237:20.16]Okay, so we've got power washer, vice grip, hydraulic press.
[237:33.38]I don't know what white is.
[237:45.30]Yellow, but PK.
[237:48.46]PK fire, PK freeze.
[237:49.92]Let's go yellow.
[237:58.39]This board, defense, so defense.
[238:03.61]So holy defense, or light defense, K defense.
[238:07.91]I'm going to go water defense.
[238:08.92]I feel like it's going to be very important.
[238:15.58]intelligence holy decay white red I'm just gonna say I'm gonna say white I guess no no no no we look a holy person yeah let's do it
[238:38.42]This board signifies healing.
[238:40.11]Oh, that's not good.
[238:40.93]I got rid of the white one.
[238:42.93]That's probably, like, holy.
[238:44.93]Or light.
[238:48.57]Uh... It could be... Fire?
[238:53.95]No.
[238:54.37]Red?
[238:54.95]Eh.
[238:55.29]Maybe the simple cool hails do.
[239:01.36]And finally, dexterity.
[239:04.18]Red.
[239:06.44]No other options, so...
[239:13.68]What did we get?
[239:16.10]All colors have been selected.
[239:17.54]Okay to send color image to DNA.
[239:20.68]Yeah, 3D print something here.
[239:22.24]Come on, let's see it.
[239:41.98]It's a dragon.
[239:45.95]If life is supposed to be born, please give it a name.
[239:49.77]What the hell is that?
[239:51.69]She don't know.
[239:54.93]Who's that?
[240:16.72]I'm not gonna... You want me to make it Thanos.
[240:18.91]Why?
[240:19.15]Thanos?
[240:21.71]We just did that.
[240:22.55]I just made Thanos in the ECW game.
[240:27.47]You want me to make Thanos the single-cell organism?
[240:41.92]No, no, not Zanos.
[240:43.56]Uh, Zan...
[240:54.21]Fuck me, come on.
[241:00.16]It was in my head, you guys were all just talking about it, and I just did A-N-O.
[241:06.94]Alright.
[241:08.92]Here we go.
[241:14.59]I don't understand...
[241:30.70]What am I supposed to do?
[241:35.70]Oh, shit.
[241:36.24]Hold on, there's another one.
[241:36.92]There's another animal over there.
[241:38.89]Okay, there's a bunch of animals.
[241:40.55]Eat the kelp?
[241:46.19]Evolution?
[242:03.76]I died.
[242:04.08]Alright, how do I eat?
[242:10.52]Option?
[242:10.76]Let's look at the controls here.
[242:12.34]I can't.
[242:16.16]I just have to survive, but how do you live?
[242:18.87]Where do you eat?
[242:19.61]How do you grow?
[242:20.33]Is there a smaller animal or something?
[242:23.97]I can't leave, I don't have legs.
[242:25.67]I can't breathe air.
[242:28.27]There's that crab again.
[242:35.66]I have to assume it's eat the... What's that?
[242:38.02]Kelp?
[242:39.24]Got it.
[242:42.00]Alright, I leveled up.
[242:43.44]I'm a slug.
[242:48.88]Can I...
[243:04.83]Avoid the crab.
[243:07.99]Come on, I gotta at least get somewhere here.
[243:10.74]What's this?
[243:13.40]Slug again.
[243:14.00]I can't leave yet.
[243:15.20]I just ate some dirt.
[243:20.70]Once you start hearing the Slender Man shit, that's when you have to leave.
[243:24.26]Where's the crab?
[243:30.06]I don't see the crab over here.
[243:33.79]Kelp?
[243:34.27]Right here?
[243:35.45]Alright, what else?
[243:36.03]What do we know?
[243:37.23]Ooh.
[243:38.75]Okay, I got somewhat of a body growing here.
[243:47.34]I don't want to eat that anymore.
[243:48.24]Okay, I don't like eating those now.
[243:53.24]Do I have to change the food?
[243:55.98]Alright.
[243:57.76]I'm going to save it.
[244:03.09]No, no, no, where's the- where is he?
[244:04.67]Where's the crab?
[244:05.07]Where's the crab?
[244:07.91]Right there.
[244:08.65]Oh, fuck.
[244:12.40]How do I get out?
[244:20.64]Oh my god, he's right behind me.
[244:22.80]How do I eat more food?
[244:23.94]Let's look at the status window.
[244:30.95]Enterable terrain.
[244:32.31]HP 5 out of 5.
[244:34.73]No part data.
[244:39.23]I can't go down here.
[244:40.03]Wait, here we go.
[244:41.49]Got it.
[244:47.80]Can I leave?
[244:48.38]Okay, hold on.
[244:51.10]Mutation EX power.
[244:53.26]Low.
[244:53.50]I have a heal.
[245:00.05]How do I turn that off?
[245:01.01]I gotta save again.
[245:04.71]Where's the crab?
[245:08.32]Oh shit!
[245:12.27]No!
[245:12.89]It doesn't want me to leave!
[245:24.50]I don't know.
[245:25.61]It's some kind of leaf monster.
[245:26.63]I don't know what the hell it is.
[245:32.01]I'm I'm picking up random stuff and eating it.
[245:41.25]Where's the crab?
[245:42.07]Right there.
[245:44.71]Plus buttons.
[245:47.15]Buttons aren't doing anything.
[245:49.75]Uh, B heals.
[245:51.89]That's my magical spell that I have.
[245:53.31]I need to find something to eat.
[246:07.64]Mutation.
[246:11.53]Level 1 head, level 1 arm.
[246:16.45]Defense, Intelligence, Heal, Dexterity.
[246:22.23]eat crab.
[246:25.23]I don't think I can eat the crab.
[246:27.55]I can barely move down here.
[246:40.31]Ooh, cave.
[246:42.25]I can't go that way.
[246:47.79]I can't go down
[246:54.70]What am I supposed to eat?!
[246:55.95]I just killed something.
[247:00.89]Okay, I just killed and ate something.
[247:03.34]What was that?!?!
[247:03.98]I don't even know what animal that was!
[247:13.62]How much more food do I need?
[247:20.44]Ah!
[247:22.52]Can I fight the crab?
[247:26.32]I'm so afraid to fight the crab.
[247:27.48]I don't have any more VMU data left.
[247:30.17]Alright, here we go.
[247:30.81]Fight crab.
[247:38.31]I got it.
[247:38.69]Okay.
[247:39.35]Did it.
[247:44.45]Am I evolving?
[247:52.90]Did I evolve?
[247:53.46]Am I bigger?
[248:01.26]Evolution.
[248:19.77]What am I doing?
[248:53.44]What the hell?
[248:55.14]Head?
[248:55.54]Okay, so I need red?
[248:56.82]Is red head?
[248:58.64]Is everybody getting this?
[249:32.65]Somebody look up the manual?
[249:40.34]Well, let me just save it.
[249:41.64]I don't think I have enough room.
[249:45.00]Can't save.
[249:45.68]Insufficient memory card.
[249:48.11]There's a bunch of dog shit on here.
[249:55.71]I think I have to kill the crab.
[250:12.30]This is the most intricate part of the game, and certainly the most frustrating, that you need a manual.
[250:23.41]Alright, well... Somebody give me some Minecraft skin coordinates, and I'll make one.
[250:29.45]Where's the crap?
[250:35.34]I can't even attack it.
[250:48.93]mine is 57 here's the faq hold on hold on a second everybody let me just see what they got here I'm just gonna do the first one I see getting started
[251:16.63]Stage one, surviving in the pond.
[251:32.73]Small strands of seaweed as small as green microorganisms.
[251:37.36]First a slug, then bigger than that.
[251:40.70]Third time you'll grow with your first working set of limbs.
[251:44.38]This is the origin creature.
[251:56.51]From here, the real fun begins.
[251:57.71]You create your now as a functional head.
[252:02.76]Go to the main menu and select mutations to view your origin in its glory.
[252:11.69]Okay.
[252:13.13]Find things that are moving but look harmless.
[252:15.53]Small and brown are your watchwords here.
[252:19.00]Some look sort of like pitcher plants or sea cucumbers.
[252:22.80]Some like crawling forearm slugs.
[252:29.15]You earn EVPs for everything you slay.
[252:32.63]For small fry like you, you're hunting now.
[252:34.07]You'll get one apiece.
[252:35.05]Crabs are worth two.
[252:36.01]If you are killed, you keep your EVPs and return to the starting monolith.
[252:39.84]So don't fear the crabs too much.
[252:43.91]And then select Evolution.
[252:47.77]You only need two EVPs at the beginning of the game to build a new part, so you can either make a beeline for the monolith after two kills, or build up some points.
[252:57.43]Alright, here we go.
[252:58.13]So that's the problem.
[252:59.46]We need one more point.
[253:03.32]We need two EVPs.
[253:04.62]We have one EVP.
[253:06.92]So look for the little things in the ground.
[253:09.80]Like this guy right here.
[253:16.55]Kill him.
[253:19.13]What?
[253:35.37]What did that happen?
[253:38.75]That wasn't a crab.
[253:39.51]That was a little guy.
[253:45.52]Alright, a little slug here.
[253:48.28]Oh, right there, right there.
[253:51.38]Alright, I'm getting the hang of it.
[253:54.90]I'm trying to figure out what's going on here.
[253:56.39]Come on, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it, get it!
[254:02.11]Got it, okay.
[254:02.59]That's two, right?
[254:22.41]Alright, before the crab gets here.
[254:23.33]Alright.
[254:24.63]Let's go level up.
[254:27.23]Shit.
[254:34.76]Fuck.
[254:37.76]I keep them though.
[254:42.60]I was stuck.
[254:43.14]There's an invisible wall.
[254:44.55]I can't go by the invisible wall.
[254:50.86]Okay, so I should have enough to do this.
[254:57.82]Should have three.
[254:58.70]Three.
[254:58.82]Alright.
[254:59.06]Okay, here we go.
[254:59.56]Do not button mash.
[255:00.28]Evolution.
[255:00.54]You're presented with a 10x10 grid to draw in and six colors to choose from.
[255:03.88]Not surprisingly,
[255:20.49]These are the same colors you chose before.
[255:24.77]You task it to draw whatever design seems appropriate, then click send.
[255:29.56]Okay, so it doesn't matter.
[255:57.39]I got Arm Level 2 from Shito.
[255:59.41]Do I... I got it?
[256:00.65]So I leveled up my arm.
[256:01.57]Alright.
[256:25.04]So I'm gonna do more damage.
[256:26.04]Can I kill the crap now?
[256:40.45]You have to equip the new arms.
[256:49.45]Alright.
[256:50.41]Mutation.
[256:53.33]Arm.
[256:55.38]Level 2, Low Fish.
[256:57.80]Ooh, okay.
[257:07.04]Nice.
[257:07.38]Alright, so now I actually have usable... These things should probably... Okay, time to kill the crab.
[257:18.47]Oh, maybe not.
[257:18.89]I need one more, right?
[257:20.77]Right here.
[257:24.08]Why is there an invisible wall there?
[257:33.59]Die!
[257:36.57]What the fuck?
[257:40.33]Wha- I am surviving one hit, but how many hits does it take to-
[257:52.81]For at least 2,000 hours.
[257:56.59]Don't give me that bullshit anymore.
[257:57.93]Alright, this should be two.
[258:00.67]This should give us another opportunity, right?
[258:04.33]Killed a slug.
[258:07.63]How many EV points do I have?
[258:10.22]EVO?
[258:11.00]EVE?
[258:11.46]What is it?
[258:11.78]I should have two, right?
[258:18.54]Let's go evolve again.
[258:28.68]I want to get a head this time.
[258:34.71]So I got two now.
[258:35.63]We're going to clear it.
[258:36.93]What else can I draw?
[258:38.91]How about a pizza slice?
[258:41.27]That's not a bad idea.
[259:35.31]No, fuck!
[259:36.07]I don't want this one here.
[260:06.81]That's fine.
[260:22.85]White.
[260:24.85]Black.
[260:26.97]Red.
[260:29.23]Blue.
[260:48.23]That's a nice pizza slice, I think.
[260:51.47]Oh my fucking god, it lags when you press the button sometimes.
[261:00.82]How do I fix that?
[261:01.46]Can I clear it?
[261:07.22]How do I clear?
[261:17.28]It's- alright, it's fucking deep dish, alright?
[261:19.38]God damn it.
[261:20.30]It's the arm.
[261:45.68]This is just... is it the same thing?
[261:57.99]Low fish.
[261:58.61]It's the same thing.
[262:05.69]Shit.
[262:12.81]Turned out to be a waste.
[262:14.63]Sorry, we can get it back.
[262:26.72]Stupid crab.
[262:27.62]No, we can't be done with this one yet.
[262:35.62]Not until I get out off the moat.
[262:43.74]We got two again.
[262:44.64]I'm gonna draw a face.
[262:47.72]Games for the Dreamcast are rare and expensive!
[262:51.84]They sure are.
[263:07.45]Two out of two, right?
[263:11.08]There it is.
[263:11.66]Alright, no pizzas.
[263:12.62]I'm gonna draw.
[263:14.92]Let's go with, like, what was my attack one?
[263:20.57]Blue?
[263:22.10]Was blue attack?
[263:22.88]Blue was offense, right?
[263:47.57]Alright, let's go with black.
[263:50.01]No, I did.
[263:50.97]I did, guys.
[263:51.41]Sorry.
[264:17.33]Um, no you didn't.
[264:18.71]I did.
[264:19.05]No, I did, actually.
[264:19.95]Arm.
[264:49.16]Don't I have three different arms though?
[264:50.68]I'm never gonna get the fuck out of here.
[265:13.19]Put arms on feet.
[265:16.29]Can you do that?
[265:16.92]No.
[265:28.84]There's one.
[265:33.03]One more, and we can try again.
[265:36.17]I have to kill that crab before I put another game in here.
[265:43.00]There's two.
[265:53.72]Back to the evolution table.
[265:59.37]Wait, hold on.
[265:59.69]Can't pick that up.
[266:04.84]There's another one right here.
[266:05.52]I'll get him.
[266:05.84]Just get there.
[266:06.50]Just get them.
[266:07.10]Farm them.
[266:18.14]Got two, four.
[266:24.33]Just grind it out.
[266:25.21]But I want to be careful.
[266:26.01]I don't want to run into a crowd.
[266:29.01]I'll get six.
[266:35.63]One more should do it.
[266:36.41]Get the bubbles.
[266:41.40]One more?
[266:42.72]Where?
[266:44.20]There's a slug.
[266:47.18]One more slug, come on.
[266:53.02]It's falling somewhere.
[267:03.30]Well, let's just go.
[267:12.75]Yeah, there are no crabs around, that's true.
[267:14.57]Okay.
[267:14.95]Um, let's do white.
[267:15.65]Let's make a piece of real abstract art.
[267:37.71]Don't put it in the arm section.
[267:43.28]Let us draw.
[267:44.22]What do you mean the arm section?
[267:45.80]I think that's the last three things I made.
[268:23.76]Let you guys do it with click maps.
[268:25.67]You want to click each individual cube.
[268:32.49]Sounds like a fucking snooze fest.
[268:36.06]Not like this isn't.
[269:12.41]Is there a... Do I... Can I... Don't use the same colors?
[269:19.19]This is... What?
[269:23.31]This is yellow, black, yellow, black, red, blue, black, white.
[269:27.81]I've never used either one of these two colors.
[269:30.78]Don't put it in the arm section, what if there- there- where's the other section?
[269:36.75]Wait, hold on, hold on a second, wait.
[269:38.93]I have to select that?
[269:40.67]The arm, I can't move it from here.
[269:52.98]I can't select anything.
[269:54.38]You can't click on the head.
[269:55.96]There's no- I can't click on anything.
[270:02.31]There's no- I can't move the cursor over to head, body, and legs!
[270:09.55]So I ha- I have- but wouldn't I do it in yellow before?
[270:12.13]Yeah, but look- alright, look look look look look.
[270:17.34]Look at- look at body down there, yellow.
[270:20.44]There's only red and yellow here.
[270:23.54]Why didn't I get a head or a body?
[270:25.12]Don't draw in the bottom left.
[270:47.86]Alright.
[270:49.28]Okay, fine.
[270:49.86]Let's try it.
[270:51.64]Let's go with white.
[270:57.13]Let's go here.
[271:34.90]What?
[271:35.10]Do you understand how this doesn't make any sense?
[271:37.22]Look, listen, listen to me, listen to me.
[271:39.54]This is a full cube.
[271:43.26]This is not just bottom left.
[271:44.96]This is bottom right.
[271:46.00]This is all of them equally.
[271:49.58]This one I can understand.
[271:50.67]But what the fuck, this one?
[271:55.29]This one is not, every single square is filled up.
[272:04.77]Arm has priority?
[272:13.17]It's just gonna default to arm if it's full.
[272:15.39]Okay, let's put the head on.
[272:40.48]No, I look pretty fucking ugly.
[272:53.81]So now I got... I got some... I got an opportunity here.
[272:59.56]Alright, let's go kick that crab's ass.
[273:06.23]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[273:11.10]Should I?
[273:11.38]I just got baited.
[273:17.58]It was aiming over at the other side.
[273:19.56]I can move in one crab now?
[273:22.36]What the heck is this thing?
[273:31.95]Got it.
[273:32.41]I just killed my first new animal.
[273:48.07]Nope, not fighting that thing.
[273:58.49]Got two more.
[274:00.15]I need a body.
[274:09.63]Fight crab?
[274:10.13]Not yet.
[274:12.64]Alright, so body is top right, and should I do yellow for body?
[274:19.08]Is that kind of the idea, or does it matter?
[274:21.64]I don't think it does.
[274:22.29]Legs, do legs instead.
[274:23.23]Bottom right.
[274:42.47]Yeah, I want defense legs.
[274:43.61]I want big beefy legs.
[274:46.42]Green legs?
[274:46.84]It's not gonna be arm two.
[275:10.22]Too bad you can't be as creative.
[275:11.42]But yeah, that's why I was drawing him.
[275:13.30]Come on.
[275:13.84]I guess you just have to make a random pattern.
[275:19.22]That looks good for a leg.
[275:20.21]What do you say?
[275:29.65]Is chat wrong?
[275:46.71]Level three.
[275:54.87]It's random and I'm unlucky?
[275:56.26]I hate this Daft Punk guy that just keeps talking.
[276:15.00]Well at least, yeah, it's level 3.
[276:17.76]There's a crab right behind me, I gotta move.
[276:21.70]You have to draw a leg to get a leg.
[276:23.32]That's not how it works.
[276:24.10]Alright, leg.
[276:24.42]No, arm.
[276:24.70]Low fish, high fish.
[276:25.23]Uh, his attack goes to 23.
[276:48.26]Ooh.
[276:49.94]Kind of like butterfly wings.
[276:51.78]Do I fight crab?
[276:54.00]Alright, crab, let's go.
[276:56.88]Not yet.
[276:57.20]No, no, no.
[276:57.72]I'm not ready.
[277:00.48]I gotta get out of the water.
[277:01.52]I need legs. ...
[277:18.46]One hit.
[277:21.70]You gotta fight him on your turf.
[277:24.00]That's true.
[277:24.56]I gotta get legs, bring him up to the land, and I'm gonna step on his head.
[277:31.56]That's what I got to do.
[277:34.62]It's... I heard that they both do traps.
[277:37.42]Alright.
[277:41.42]Alright.
[277:50.44]Come on.
[277:53.14]Come on, hurry, go go go!
[277:53.93]Alright, I need legs.
[277:57.19]So, is this just horse shit?
[277:58.93]Do I- should I be listening to you guys?
[278:00.51]I don't think I should be.
[278:01.31]Um, I'm gonna go with blue- ugh.
[278:02.59]Do one dot.
[278:03.13]In the leg section.
[278:03.69]Draw a car.
[278:18.63]Fuck it.
[278:21.60]Blue?
[278:23.84]No.
[278:25.06]I'm making two legs.
[278:26.02]Give me legs.
[278:26.76]Chet.
[278:27.86]You were very wrong.
[279:09.02]You draw legs in the leg square.
[279:10.77]That's what I just did.
[279:12.27]I just did that.
[279:20.31]I can't fight two crabs.
[279:25.23]Come here, slugs.
[279:26.49]I need two more.
[279:28.33]Come on.
[279:28.99]I can't go that way.
[279:30.19]Come on.
[279:31.10]Why?
[279:33.26]Get out.
[279:33.78]No.
[279:52.69]Head.
[279:53.42]Thank god.
[279:55.12]No.
[279:55.66]Why can't I put this on?
[280:00.28]Arm.
[280:02.16]Why can't I put the head on?
[280:05.46]Arm.
[280:10.23]Try all sorts of designs.
[280:11.19]You might be surprised at what you find.
[280:12.41]Geometric shapes, mirror images, symmetrical designs, like little random U-shapes here and there, little random dots.
[280:19.55]Head.
[280:26.51]It's because I'm back to being scrub level.
[280:33.70]That's going to get out of the water.
[280:47.97]Is there a crab over there?
[281:02.78]No, not next.
[281:03.66]Not yet.
[281:05.20]If I get out of the water and the game sucks, then we can go from there.
[281:09.19]But this is an interesting concept.
[281:11.51]Where is he?
[281:11.89]I just need to get out of the pond.
[281:26.73]Once I get out of Goldshire, I'll be fine.
[281:30.97]Those are two crabs.
[281:32.20]Come on, why are they so fast?
[281:33.16]Are there any other... little squids?
[281:44.43]I can't tell if that thing is... I mean, how am I supposed to fight these?
[281:47.99]I have a constant crab.
[281:59.50]There's a bug chasing me, too.
[282:03.02]The bug hit me.
[282:04.68]It didn't really hurt that much.
[282:08.18]Okay.
[282:17.95]Please, give me legs.
[282:20.29]Get the crab away.
[282:29.68]Legs.
[282:30.10]Alright.
[282:30.34]We're gonna draw something cool.
[282:31.66]Ready?
[282:31.90]Watch this one.
[282:36.08]Forget about little shapes.
[282:36.99]We're going all in.
[283:20.98]Oh, my God.
[283:39.28]The designs are only worth arm level two.
[283:42.10]There's a bug fighting me.
[283:44.18]Where?
[283:44.78]Look at him.
[283:45.50]Can you hit him?
[283:47.24]I know you can do it.
[283:49.84]And now here comes the crab.
[283:53.03]Get out quick!
[283:54.01]Get out!
[283:54.61]Get away!
[283:55.13]Get out!
[283:55.55]Get away from me!
[284:04.06]I just want something else besides arm, too.
[284:07.36]I'm going to do, like, I don't know.
[284:08.64]I'm going to do an elaborate Tetris thing.
[284:22.01]Arm.
[284:24.77]I can't put this on.
[284:27.23]Powers.
[284:27.67]I have wind.
[284:29.93]How did I get wind?
[284:43.89]Come on, kill it.
[284:45.34]Is it still alive?
[285:11.93]God.
[285:12.73]I need my arm level 3.
[285:21.41]Why did I de-evolve my arms?
[285:22.89]I didn't.
[285:23.99]When you die, you have to come back and do it again, essentially.
[285:28.80]He's dead.
[285:34.26]If a design creates something that's almost useful, say a leg that's too powerful for you to use, or one that's underpowered for you,
[285:42.23]Try modifying it just a little and resending it.
[285:45.41]And add some dots.
[285:51.66]I still can't put it on.
[286:02.99]Come on.
[286:06.32]And here comes the crab.
[286:09.77]There really is no point to the crab being in the tutorial pond.
[286:15.85]And there's no point to those rocks.
[286:17.25]And the rocks, they're just, you can't go through them.
[286:20.27]You can't, they... Oh, man.
[286:29.44]I very clearly could go through those rocks.
[286:45.19]Do I have any evolution points here?
[286:50.87]Do a U shape around the grid.
[286:51.99]So like, you're talking about like this.
[286:53.21]Would you classify that as a U?
[286:54.15]Around?
[286:54.69]Is that a U?
[287:16.24]No, U!
[287:17.84]Your mileage will vary.
[287:21.42]No, no, no.
[287:22.10]Small U shapes.
[287:26.76]So we're talking about like... Like these.
[287:49.08]Don't put one in arm.
[287:50.10]Okay.
[288:19.74]Send it back?
[288:20.26]Hold on, I need to... I can't even put these on.
[288:49.17]No!
[288:49.55]The crab!
[288:50.95]Why do you exist?
[288:54.47]Try different colors?
[288:55.29]Alright, I did white and black before.
[288:57.33]It was still the same thing.
[288:58.41]I can't pick him up.
[289:09.14]Mad because crab.
[289:10.22]Alright, I'm trying this one more time.
[289:11.68]Before I just rage quit and something else.
[289:24.66]Alright, what color have I not used?
[289:28.38]Red?
[289:31.04]I did.
[289:31.40]Okay, blue hues.
[289:33.72]That, whatever that is.
[289:36.36]Blue legs.
[289:38.36]Blue and white in the corner.
[289:40.82]Black and white.
[289:43.04]Green and white.
[289:44.64]Blue, black.
[289:46.62]Red.
[289:46.86]We're going red.
[289:54.47]Red?
[289:54.75]Let's see.
[290:32.22]Do you have to, is it the color?
[290:40.11]I don't even know what to ask.
[290:41.75]Is it the color?
[290:43.53]So if it's blue in the top.
[290:45.49]Blueprint, somebody's got a blueprint.
[290:51.43]Is that for real?
[290:55.84]It's time to stop, no it's not, not yet.
[291:00.20]Not yet.
[291:00.54]It's not meant to soon.
[291:05.56]No, this is the corner.
[291:06.20]I can't.
[291:06.38]I'm backing myself in the corner.
[291:07.12]I gotta back up.
[291:07.54]I gotta get out of here.
[291:08.30]Go, go, go, go, go.
[291:08.68]No, no, no, no, no.
[291:09.30]Oh, there's two crabs.
[291:12.92]Are there three crabs?
[291:13.78]I'm really liking the zero slugs that they've got here.
[291:26.25]This is great.
[291:44.98]Still can't put that on.
[291:50.95]Streamer's going to leave an angry Yahoo.
[291:52.67]I just, I just, I just want to get out of the pond.
[292:01.43]That's all I want, is to get out of the pond.
[292:03.99]And then we can play anything else.
[292:05.57]We have to get out of the pond first, though.
[292:08.16]That's very important.
[292:19.42]Should be better.
[292:27.36]Do I have enough to evolve?
[292:32.72]I need five to evolve?
[292:35.58]Why?
[292:36.58]It was two for so long.
[292:37.98]What?
[292:43.05]Thank you, Frodeon, for the ten community subs.
[292:47.71]Thank you so much, Frodeon.
[292:55.04]Make a big white Z pattern.
[293:00.63]God.
[293:00.97]Can I just redeem arms?
[293:08.13]I would love to.
[293:15.15]Oh my.
[293:15.93]Please, just get away from me.
[293:22.45]Wind first.
[293:23.45]How do I even use it?
[293:29.20]I can't- I don't know how- I can't even use the weapon.
[293:30.80]I think it's stuck.
[293:42.77]Yeah, I didn't die from one hit from a crab.
[294:31.12]Nooooooo, whatever.
[294:34.02]I need five.
[294:34.56]It's because I made too many fucking arms and I can't do anything with these.
[294:40.24]I need five.
[294:41.14]I might as well just redo it.
[294:43.67]New character.
[294:49.99]No, get away from me.
[295:06.77]Red and green only.
[295:15.15]I need to make a new character.
[295:16.43]No, nobody wants to watch me do that.
[295:17.99]I wish I could go down here.
[295:36.86]Exit!
[295:55.73]No, get me out of the game!
[296:01.67]This game has so much potential!
[296:06.24]But now we're so out of reach because I made too many arms.
[296:20.30]Just do it again.
[296:21.18]I'm out of reach.
[296:23.82]Yeah.
[296:25.48]That's funny.
[296:29.11]I know I can't edit.
[296:31.09]There's nothing to edit and I can't do anything about it.
[296:34.52]Going ahead like this.
[296:37.96]No.
[296:42.34]It's going to take a very long time to get where I am now.
[296:45.92]But look at the spawns.
[296:46.91]I need like five slugs to spawn.
[296:49.07]Here's one.
[296:56.91]Is somebody actually linking an imgur to a full-on leg bloop?
[297:03.30]You know what I'm saying?
[297:04.34]Is there a leg blueprint in chat here?
[297:14.04]No cheating?
[297:14.66]No, I don't care about cheating at this point.
[297:18.28]The game's cheating.
[297:20.18]I gotta even it out.
[297:29.24]Okay, how many more?
[297:30.04]Two more?
[297:39.36]Finally!
[297:39.78]You finally started to spawn st- No, I can't move.
[297:45.62]I'm stuck here.
[297:51.39]When I looked at the game, I looked up stuff about the box art, and I saw the description.
[298:00.21]I thought this was going to be the best one.
[298:01.81]I thought this was going to be my favorite Dreamcast game.
[298:04.52]I was very, very, I was certain of it almost.
[298:19.76]I need one or two more slugs and I can do this.
[298:21.96]I'm trying this one last final time.
[298:26.26]With the ingerling.
[298:35.17]Okay.
[298:36.29]Alright, alright.
[298:37.65]I can do that.
[298:39.39]I can do that one.
[298:40.01]Okay.
[298:54.57]Alright, let's do it I need nothing I can't like modify these I can't like change them
[299:34.16]I really don't even mind getting killed by... I thought that was a slug.
[299:38.30]It's a praying mantis.
[299:42.93]Getting killed by the crab resets the slug spawns, so I'm actually alright with dying.
[300:01.38]Oh, somebody just kill me.
[300:02.88]Just kill me.
[300:03.48]Do it again.
[300:19.06]Am I hitting anything?
[300:45.91]I got it!
[300:47.01]Whatever, I got slug spawn.
[300:50.38]Alright, I'm going to try this thing.
[300:53.17]Somebody put a legit blueprint in the chat, and I'm going to use it.
[300:55.73]Let's go evolve.
[301:05.82]You could just kite the crab around and shoot it.
[301:07.46]I mean, he moves... Well, not when you get stuck.
[301:14.35]I could try.
[301:15.05]Not when this is not the crab sitting right next to you.
[301:21.53]somehow didn't die I don't think I'm gonna be able to do it just give it to me they're gonna kill me just give it to me
[301:43.06]Because he can still move.
[301:44.00]Because I can't move right now.
[301:45.63]See?
[301:46.79]If he has a good line... Oh, he's gonna... Oh, here we go.
[301:49.29]Yeah, I can kill the crab.
[301:50.23]I'm gonna get a crab kill right now.
[301:55.01]He's stuck.
[301:56.55]Holy shit.
[301:59.19]What is a crab worth?
[302:11.40]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[302:18.04]Y'all thought we were going away from this game?
[302:21.76]Nope.
[302:33.40]Okay, blueprint.
[302:39.93]I don't care about colors, I'm following this blueprint exactly.
[303:12.22]That's minion art?
[303:15.88]Wrong blueprint, what do you mean?
[303:25.41]Minion art.
[303:29.89]Okay, god damn it!
[303:32.00]I'm so antsy right now.
[303:33.92]I just want something that's not an arm.
[303:35.26]Okay, here we go.
[303:36.90]This is the, this is the, somebody just link this.
[303:39.22]Here we go, ready?
[303:47.96]you
[304:12.57]leg it's like pink pink is red red and white red and white makes pink red and white makes pink red and white makes pink
[304:43.54]you
[305:14.61]I can edit these, but am I allowed to resend them with no... I need EVP to resend them.
[305:33.65]Sooner or later you're going to get whacked, probably quite often.
[305:35.85]When you do, you wake up next to the initial monolith back in the origin stage.
[305:39.30]Once you stop screaming... What?
[305:43.87]Just do the American flag?
[305:47.43]Joel says make American flag.
[305:55.08]What have I done even so far?
[305:56.22]I've done the automaton.
[306:01.54]Slice of pizza.
[306:03.30]A happy smiley face.
[306:06.38]Guy jumping at you.
[306:10.13]Chat was wrong.
[306:12.27]Chat was wrong too.
[306:14.93]Chat was wrong three.
[306:18.81]Random to try to get anything.
[306:22.09]Chat was wrong four.
[306:26.53]Guy playing golf.
[306:27.85]Golfing.
[306:30.38]Chat was wrong five.
[306:31.42]And chat was wrong six.
[306:40.10]So I'm not clicking any more of your Imgur links.
[306:47.13]One... One red cube in the lower right is what you're telling me I need to do.
[306:51.79]Okay, okay, alright.
[307:01.08]It's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-it's-
[307:15.25]Small you around grid.
[307:18.11]I need some more slugs.
[307:19.89]I can't stop playing this.
[307:23.13]We've been looking at the same image.
[307:38.50]Four more.
[307:53.02]Put it on the head and the arms?
[307:53.98]I can't, I'm not strong enough.
[307:56.86]My character sucks, I can't put him on now.
[307:59.58]Come on, you ready?
[308:02.10]See?
[308:03.92]I can't even wear these.
[308:04.84]Because my pr- but my prot is too low.
[308:19.23]Fire!
[308:21.78]Where did I get fire from?
[308:22.98]Why do I have fire?
[308:26.04]Okay.
[308:27.46]Fire crab.
[308:28.32]You got it.
[308:33.44]Can you go, like, any faster?
[308:35.70]Okay.
[308:38.11]Back this way.
[308:47.09]Back it up.
[308:47.69]Back up, back up, back up, back up.
[308:51.36]Got him.
[308:52.98]Get his buddy too.
[308:54.87]This is food for a month.
[309:03.91]Play Floygen Brothers to calm down.
[309:17.20]Is that enough?
[309:19.64]Don't tell me that I can't go down here to pick up the body.
[309:22.50]Oh my god.
[309:24.26]Am I gonna play Resident Evil 2?
[309:41.39]Yes, I am.
[309:43.57]Just not today.
[309:44.53]I'll need to start that tomorrow.
[309:47.99]Or...
[309:52.71]I don't know.
[309:54.01]We'll see.
[309:54.49]I am going to play it, though.
[309:56.37]Okay, I've got enough to do one, so... Let's do the American flag.
[310:04.92]Okay, without looking, I'm going to do the American flag.
[310:28.30]Thank you.
[311:08.08]That's nothing that's not the American flag Hey arm to
[311:39.96]Alright, I think I have to give up on this game.
[311:44.34]I think so.
[311:44.94]I mean, this game is stupid.
[311:51.85]But look, what am I supposed to do?
[311:53.93]I keep getting arm two.
[311:57.75]Black, top left, red, bottom right.
[312:01.13]I've tried this the last time I'm going to do this.
[312:07.40]There's probably so much video game here, they head behind... Arm 2.
[312:13.95]Can you imagine how much is in this game?
[312:17.11]That you cannot access?
[312:25.45]Let's try it.
[312:43.84]black top left red bottom right wait wait you guys are saying all like three different things black top left dot bottom right red dot this is this is gonna work you're telling me yes do it
[313:13.04]Body 10.
[313:16.38]What?
[313:18.98]Why is it body 10?
[313:21.32]That was a cheat code.
[313:22.09]Somebody, that's a cheat code.
[313:28.09]Body.
[313:30.61]Stab Scorpion.
[313:31.58]I can't even use this.
[313:33.68]Not even close.
[313:42.63]I need to level up like 48 times.
[313:56.50]So I have to eat 48 bodies.
[313:58.26]Are you trying to keep me here?
[314:00.80]Are you trying to lock me here?
[314:12.56]No, don't go away from me!
[314:27.51]Just play this for the rest of the night.
[314:29.13]I... I... I feel like everyone's gonna run away.
[314:40.08]Now, realistically, how often can you watch the guy on the screen in front of your computer using his goldfish hands to punch slugs before you're like, yeah, you know what, I guess there's something else I could probably do right now.
[314:55.58]And I can't go down here.
[314:59.84]Do blobs.
[315:02.12]There's only one or two blobs per...
[315:17.76]If I walk on out of here, then the real stream begins.
[315:23.17]You understand?
[315:26.29]I stand up on my own two feet, and I'm walking over that mountain.
[315:43.83]It's a real stream coming up here.
[315:45.80]Here we go.
[315:46.20]I'm gonna do what I would consider to be a real black top left and nothing else.
[316:03.99]But it's gonna be another cheat with it's level 10 hands or something.
[316:16.33]Don't waste the proteins.
[316:25.01]Who cares if it's cheating?
[316:26.37]Okay, here we go.
[316:30.22]Somebody says green square right in the middle.
[316:32.74]Is that what you want?
[316:33.36]Is that what we're talking about?
[316:41.22]No.
[316:46.48]Just one black dot in the top left.
[316:50.49]Except one guy said it.
[316:51.59]Whatever.
[316:53.85]I can't use this.
[316:56.19]I can't use this.
[316:57.71]What am I supposed to do with that?
[317:02.03]What do you want me to do with that?
[317:05.19]No, I'm doing Minecraft Steve next.
[317:07.96]And it's gonna get me something amazing.
[317:30.04]What even is it?
[317:30.74]Arm.
[317:34.16]Demon.
[317:36.88]Demon arm.
[317:38.86]This is endgame content.
[317:44.43]I can't do anything with that.
[317:46.95]Alright, Minecraft Steve.
[317:52.32]Minecraft Steve.
[317:52.96]Okay, he's got the hair on top, right?
[318:01.23]It goes down like this.
[318:02.21]And then... He's got blue eyes.
[318:03.71]Right?
[318:28.97]I guess it has a goatee.
[318:30.53]What can I do?
[318:31.31]I guess this?
[319:00.49]It's not Cheeto!
[319:08.36]Minecraft Steve?
[319:10.94]No, he's got like a nose too, doesn't he?
[319:14.74]What color should I do the nose?
[319:26.13]Uh... It's an emoji.
[319:35.53]Spongebob.
[319:36.85]That's my- hold on.
[319:38.31]I said I was gonna do Minecraft Steve, so I'm gonna do it.
[319:40.68]Oh my god, no.
[319:47.62]No.
[319:53.10]Fuck.
[319:53.94]Fuck.
[319:54.70]Fuck.
[319:56.34]Ugh.
[320:09.45]Okay, try it again.
[320:11.03]What was the other thing I was gonna do?
[320:17.01]One yellow line down the bottom.
[320:38.95]I don't even have enough fucking protein powder.
[320:44.01]Do I have enough to even... Just make a T-pose.
[320:55.43]I can't believe that didn't do anything.
[320:57.83]Okay.
[321:00.65]Okay, I can put on my level 3 hands.
[321:06.05]And crabs aren't gonna kill me anymore.
[321:08.81]I can put on my desert bonehead.
[321:11.85]So that looks good.
[321:13.07]Okay.
[321:14.79]I'm kind of decked out right now.
[321:20.26]What, 14?
[321:24.80]Demon arms I can't do.
[321:26.88]Alright, let's go.
[321:27.40]Okay.
[321:38.33]I can't even see who's down here.
[321:39.55]Okay, another slug.
[321:40.16]Alright, that's enough.
[321:57.20]There's the crab.
[321:57.98]Oh, he's getting in close!
[322:03.34]Do it again, again, again, again, again, again!
[322:10.91]Okay, let's try it again.
[322:16.59]I think you're supposed to lose, guys.
[322:18.23]You're supposed to get your ass kicked.
[322:20.43]Get tons of protein powder points.
[322:30.11]I'm at a point where I can reliably kill all these.
[322:33.36]In one or two hits.
[322:38.44]Observe.
[322:41.28]Okay, you want me to make it just a big Z?
[322:52.15]There's another one.
[322:52.91]What's this one?
[322:53.41]So you want a Z. Just a giant Z.
[323:23.70]I gotta make sure this is correct.
[323:26.11]Oh, fucking stupid, the yellow thing.
[323:28.43]Hold on.
[323:53.10]Okay.
[323:53.84]There's your Z. I make a Z. And it's done.
[324:02.14]Somebody got it.
[324:06.62]We got legs.
[324:10.04]It's done.
[324:10.40]I am so excited to put these on.
[324:15.79]Legs.
[324:16.13]New legs.
[324:17.03]High fish.
[324:17.93]Put them on.
[324:22.93]Ugh.
[324:25.17]We're still in the pond.
[324:26.57]We can't leave.
[324:31.97]They're not legs.
[324:33.23]Yeah.
[324:38.54]Can I go on this walk?
[324:48.50]I was holding it in.
[324:51.74]Into the cave.
[325:07.27]What the fuck was that thing?
[325:08.46]I think that's a boss.
[325:10.80]I'm not going in there.
[325:21.92]We just got access to the deep pond.
[325:28.93]Alright, don't screw this up.
[325:30.39]I just need some more, and then I can get a good body, and then I can throw my entire career down the toilet by playing this game every day.
[325:46.95]And nothing else, ever.
[325:52.43]Save game?
[325:52.93]I can't.
[325:55.88]I don't have any more space on the VMU that I bought.
[325:59.58]Which, shame on the place that I got it from.
[326:04.60]Because they didn't even have the wherewithal to remove the shit that was... Hold on a second, I gotta pay attention.
[326:12.75]There's a bunch of random games that are still on here from some dude in, like, 1998.
[326:16.11]I don't have any powers?
[326:23.49]Okay.
[326:23.97]Fire?
[326:24.43]What?
[326:24.79]Water?
[326:29.12]Where is this camera located?
[326:30.74]That was my responsibility?
[326:41.85]No, it's the responsibility of when it comes in used, and somebody's selling it used, you wipe it.
[326:48.84]I don't want your, like, fucking tabs on here.
[326:50.98]I don't want your, like, internet cache on here.
[327:03.06]I actually think I'm pretty good right now.
[327:10.63]Nobody can even hurt me.
[327:15.99]Crab doesn't do very much.
[327:19.19]Okay, we're fine.
[327:23.53]I love looking at what the mystery person played on their Dreamcast.
[327:28.28]Yeah.
[327:31.05]It's alright though.
[327:31.67]I think I can actually do something interesting here.
[327:34.03]I think I can pull this out and delete stuff off of it.
[327:38.31]Handheld.
[327:38.65]I have so much EVP points.
[327:44.16]Let's see if we can make something happen.
[327:56.10]Equip that body.
[328:01.38]No, I'm not there yet.
[328:07.41]I can't do Demon Arm either, guys.
[328:18.00]Land?
[328:18.32]Can I... I can't... What?
[328:26.46]Uh-oh.
[328:27.82]That's a... I don't want to get killed here.
[328:29.82]Got it.
[328:42.41]You can walk on land with the leg, but... Hold on, just wait one sec.
[328:46.15]Oops.
[328:48.13]These guys killed me in one hit before, too.
[328:52.61]What the hell is hitting me?
[329:02.26]I'm not going to do any evolution stuff until I have at least 50 of these.
[329:09.40]That's right, you heard that.
[329:10.36]Don't adjust your audio there.
[329:11.64]That was 5-0.
[329:27.67]I wonder how many people were watching that we got to the point where that was arm level 2 for, like, the 15th time.
[329:35.19]And they were secretly hoping.
[329:37.09]Oh man, I hope he does not actually get out of this.
[329:40.26]I hope he rage quits the game.
[329:42.70]Where's Tony Hawk?
[329:44.44]I would say it too, probably.
[329:45.48]In fact, I think I did.
[330:01.47]Where's Seaman?
[330:02.63]I'll explain Seaman again.
[330:04.57]I was gonna play that today.
[330:06.77]Unfortunately though, when I bought it... Where I bought it from, the person did not put the mic in the package.
[330:14.49]It was just the game.
[330:15.75]And the game doesn't do anything without the mic.
[330:19.13]Unfortunately.
[330:19.69]Okay, I got 25 of these.
[330:29.31]Alright, I need something interesting.
[330:30.77]How about we do... Guy eating cheese.
[330:39.21]Or cheese eating a guy.
[330:41.91]Flip it on him, you know what I mean?
[330:52.64]You messed it up, you messed it up, you messed it up.
[330:57.28]You can walk on land with these.
[331:01.76]Wait, whoa, whoa, whoa, easy!
[331:03.32]What?
[331:07.98]Pac-Man is a good one, too.
[331:14.83]How did I screw this up last time?
[331:16.07]There's one in the middle here.
[331:23.65]That's it.
[331:24.01]Yeah, that's it.
[331:26.43]So you tell me this is something else.
[331:39.57]Is it different?
[331:53.99]Thanks for dumping my protein powder in the sink.
[331:59.26]Alright.
[332:05.20]I was gonna eat that and go get a pump on, man.
[332:07.42]Alright, let's go with...
[332:12.87]What do I want to draw?
[332:13.91]How about... What have I used so far?
[332:16.33]Let me see.
[332:16.99]I've got plenty of options.
[332:18.69]Goodbye, Craft Steve.
[332:19.67]Pac-Man.
[332:19.91]Pac-Man.
[332:20.33]I've got to get this right.
[332:45.86]you
[333:25.39]He's like going up that way.
[333:26.33]Is there a green ghost?
[333:51.97]He's going up and eating them.
[334:15.71]Should I do the whole background black?
[334:18.79]He's a circle?
[334:19.47]Well, he's turning up top left and opening his mouth and going that way.
[334:48.80]Simple shapes.
[334:50.90]Okay.
[334:54.48]What's the point of having this if I have to do like two squares and then go?
[335:00.98]Oh!
[335:01.50]Well that's a fun fucking game!
[335:03.04]What is it?
[335:35.29]You fucking assholes.
[335:38.25]Unbelievable.
[335:39.25]Now you're gonna gnome me after that shit?
[335:44.90]Why?
[335:45.62]Why would you do that?
[335:47.56]Whatever, okay.
[335:49.18]Stab Scorpion, I need two more.
[336:03.12]Level 11 by two black squares.
[336:11.56]Draw, yeah, okay, fine.
[336:15.27]Draw the gnome.
[336:20.13]No, I'm just gonna do this.
[336:21.01]This is the dumbest game ever.
[336:24.78]This is stupid.
[336:45.94]I spent the last hour and a half just trying to figure out, like, oh, draw stuff and maybe do a pizza, a guy, a design, a shape.
[336:56.60]Try this shape.
[336:57.30]How about these shapes?
[336:59.24]No, just do two squares.
[337:00.34]And get level 11 and 19.
[337:11.11]Draw the American flag.
[337:16.61]Leg.
[337:47.77]I got lizard legs and I got monkey legs.
[337:54.00]It's time to walk on land.
[338:00.29]Too many squares.
[338:05.07]It's really about the minimalist approach of one or two dots.
[338:19.76]What do I have right now?
[338:28.76]Eat the blobs for protein?
[338:30.00]Yeah.
[338:30.64]They just spawn in random places.
[338:31.88]God damn it.
[338:40.71]All that time.
[338:42.19]Wasted.
[338:44.33]Trying to.
[338:45.63]Ugh.
[338:46.93]All we had to do is two dots.
[338:53.94]What do I have right now?
[338:56.64]49?
[338:56.84]Is that... but close.
[338:59.02]Lizard Rex, 59.
[339:00.30]67.
[339:00.73]I think I can put on something else, though.
[339:03.35]What's the body?
[339:04.65]10?
[339:05.31]Okay.
[339:05.83]Scorpion body.
[339:15.28]I might be almost ready to fight that giant slug in the other room.
[339:20.86]Not quite.
[339:24.67]I need some more protein packs.
[339:33.08]I demand Beanbag Sonic.
[339:34.40]I'm not sure we can make Beanbag Sonic.
[339:42.73]If you walk on land, I will sub for five months consecutively.
[339:49.39]I gotta do that now.
[339:57.87]I'm going to get on land.
[339:58.73]It's going to happen.
[339:59.31]We have the legs already.
[340:09.26]Protein blobs.
[340:13.46]My brain is stuck over here.
[340:17.15]Why is my health low?
[340:17.99]Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
[340:27.73]Do I have a heal?
[340:30.97]Water first, water second.
[340:34.95]So I have a better water ability now?
[340:37.35]Let's try it out.
[340:39.19]Water two.
[340:43.80]Pretty good.
[340:51.38]This guy over here... I hear a crab.
[340:53.98]Crabs are still dangerous.
[341:01.62]I think we're looking upside down right now.
[341:06.56]If you max out your creature, I will sub for 12 months.
[341:09.54]I don't know if that's gonna happen.
[341:11.90]Another crab.
[341:20.89]I'll be happy as long as we got out of that stupid little pond in the beginning.
[341:24.19]No, I gotta get out of this pond!
[341:26.06]It's very important.
[341:36.43]If I beat this game, you will give me 1.2 million dollars.
[341:44.08]If that were real, that's the easiest money anyone could ever make.
[341:49.99]That's a very bad investment.
[341:51.63]I'm gonna tell you that that's a not sound use of your money.
[341:54.48]I would refrain, I'd say refrain from doing that.
[342:01.56]Let's see.
[342:02.70]There's one red dot in the middle.
[342:05.94]Let's go with a green dot.
[342:11.40]We're gonna go green in the corners.
[342:13.85]Oh no, green like this.
[342:20.37]I'm going to go yellow.
[342:33.40]Head 12.
[342:35.84]That's pretty good, actually.
[342:36.86]And we're going to go blue.
[342:43.55]Blue in each corner.
[342:50.16]Arm 25 again.
[342:51.03]At least we have a lot to look at.
[342:53.53]Let's see.
[343:02.76]Head.
[343:04.12]Lizard head.
[343:06.40]Can't use it yet, still.
[343:09.04]Why?
[343:09.34]Why not?
[343:12.00]Brought 66?
[343:12.36]Okay.
[343:23.62]Lizard Rex.
[343:26.36]I'm not sure I'm understanding this, though.
[343:28.58]So, I can't wear these because... I have 62.
[343:34.64]Right?
[343:38.27]So, if this was minus... If this is minus 60, wouldn't it put me at 2?
[344:01.85]You have zero.
[344:03.47]So I'd have to take it off of other places.
[344:07.49]I see.
[344:08.05]Okay.
[344:18.27]Your fish sucks.
[344:23.50]I wonder if I can fight that slug over there.
[344:28.76]Ah, hello, hello, hello!
[344:29.66]Let me have control of my character, please!
[344:31.10]Alright, let's see if I can unequip a few things and walk around.
[344:44.88]Because I'm just curious.
[344:49.93]So, if I take off the arms...
[344:53.41]That leaves me with, okay, 11 and a 7.
[344:54.71]Alright, I get it.
[344:55.45]I see.
[344:57.19]Take off, like, the body, too.
[345:04.36]Just want to see what happens.
[345:12.46]Legs.
[345:13.14]Lizard!
[345:15.18]That's 42.
[345:15.66]I still can't do it.
[345:16.36]I need 112.
[345:17.28]Head.
[345:24.85]I can put the lizard head on though.
[345:34.16]I'm not sure it's worth having that.
[345:44.07]I don't think so.
[345:46.83]Yeah, this thing sucks.
[345:55.71]Put the High Fish, the Stab, Scorpion Arms.
[345:58.26]Wait a minute!
[346:03.74]Oh boy.
[346:04.28]I think I'm ready to tumble.
[346:12.47]What's my attack?
[346:15.33]I still have the High Fish and I still have the Body.
[346:21.24]But what's better?
[346:22.82]Having higher defense or having a huge amount of offense right now?
[346:27.61]Probably the defense.
[346:29.65]I mean, that's a huge increase, but I still have to stab shit.
[346:38.56]Yeah.
[346:41.26]Alright.
[346:42.08]Let's try to fight the boss.
[346:47.20]I got everything equipped.
[346:49.18]All my arms.
[346:49.80]No, I can't do any other arms.
[346:53.35]Nope.
[346:54.53]It's desert bone.
[346:55.71]Alright.
[346:57.03]Let's go fight the boss after I get healed.
[347:03.03]Do I have good spells?
[347:05.86]I have water.
[347:06.50]I've got the level 30 water one.
[347:09.10]I'm sure that's going to do some damage.
[347:21.66]I guess I could just run through more protein blobs.
[347:30.42]If I get one shot, you better believe that I'm going... Immediately to the next game.
[347:36.79]Abso-positive-alutely.
[347:41.23]Because I... That would be so... That would be so sad.
[347:52.75]What is this game?
[347:53.49]This game is for the Dreamcast.
[347:54.87]It's called... I don't know why I was just going to say Steins Gate.
[348:00.30]That's not what this is.
[348:01.08]It's not even remotely similar.
[348:07.08]Save before the boss.
[348:08.50]Okay, hold on.
[348:08.94]Let me see if this is even possible.
[348:10.06]Can I just pull out the fucking EMP device?
[348:13.61]This ain't going to crash my game, right?
[348:17.51]It shouldn't.
[348:19.95]Because I can go through this.
[348:22.24]And, like, delete shit.
[348:27.24]Okay, here we go.
[348:27.78]I can turn this on.
[348:35.57]How do I turn this shit on?
[348:40.23]Can you act to access the Dreamcast screen?
[348:47.62]Do I have a second Dreamcast I can plug in?
[348:52.41]Needs batteries.
[348:53.39]Oh, fuck.
[348:54.15]Okay.
[348:57.68]I think the battery's already in here, aren't there?
[349:02.60]It's okay.
[349:03.48]I'll get the... When I take my next break, I'm not gonna die.
[349:07.57]I'll, uh... I'll grab some batteries.
[349:20.27]That beep means it has none.
[349:21.81]Okay.
[349:22.11]That's good to know.
[349:32.12]Gerber's taking longer to grow legs than actual prehistoric beings.
[349:37.34]Alright, I'm getting stuck.
[349:39.80]Crab doesn't even hurt anymore.
[349:40.84]Look at how far we've come.
[349:51.32]Please, batteries, save us from this hell.
[349:58.66]I am a crab now, that's right.
[350:00.34]Okay, I need protein blobs.
[350:09.75]You're not really gonna come at me, are you?
[350:14.38]Just go fight the boss?
[350:15.56]I need batteries!
[350:16.36]I can't do that yet.
[350:25.69]What kind of batteries go in here?
[350:28.81]They're not like AA or AAA.
[350:30.41]Is it like a watch battery?
[350:39.40]What do I got?
[350:39.82]A prod.
[350:47.32]Where is my prod?
[350:47.94]It's not even on here.
[350:55.27]It's a quadruple A. I haven't ran into any blobs.
[351:14.07]For some reason, there's no audio anymore.
[351:17.41]Okay, there it is now.
[351:22.76]Go to Walmart and get them.
[351:24.88]No, we just can't lose.
[351:26.68]I'm not gonna lose.
[351:27.58]That's all that has to happen.
[351:36.03]Where are these stupid blobs?
[351:41.03]Finally.
[351:41.41]It took you ages to spawn.
[351:42.91]What do I got now?
[351:55.22]I'm going in.
[351:56.97]I'm going in.
[351:57.91]Let's go.
[351:59.53]I'm ready.
[352:07.36]Really?
[352:26.98]Water 2.
[352:28.92]Bingo.
[352:30.00]Dead.
[352:30.64]One hit.
[352:33.76]Where's my character?
[352:34.42]Why don't I have control of the character?
[352:35.82]I'm fine!
[352:36.32]Look at that!
[352:46.44]It's okay.
[352:47.24]It's alright.
[352:48.16]We're trading hits.
[352:54.03]Dead.
[352:58.24]I'm gonna run out of... shit here.
[353:04.05]What the fucking goddammit, come on, why?
[353:07.13]What the hell?
[353:15.96]Back it up a jo- oh, that's it.
[353:17.88]Okay.
[353:21.62]I have a heal, too.
[353:23.56]Look at all these random powers.
[353:28.00]How do I get EP back?
[353:44.87]I wonder what's the most effective against the slug.
[353:49.27]Fire... Lightning?
[353:55.18]Water, too, does a lot of... I would assume it's way more damage.
[354:04.21]Use lightning and make you both crispy.
[354:05.81]Yeah, that would happen.
[354:06.53]Alright, I gotta get out of the menu.
[354:09.83]Alright, let's go.
[354:12.68]I am gonna heal, though, one more time to get to full health.
[354:23.43]I wasn't taking very much damage there.
[354:25.57]And I do have a heal.
[354:27.19]So I can run around in a circle.
[354:34.48]You are just pathetic.
[354:38.48]Yeah, I remember you too.
[354:40.70]I did like a YouTuber scream when you guys came over that first time.
[354:43.93]Not now.
[354:46.75]Um.
[354:51.22]I can't get the Cursed Attack to go over you.
[354:58.06]Get over here.
[354:59.06]Okay.
[355:02.26]Yeah, I've got power now.
[355:06.14]And once we beat this boss, we get to unlock the next zone.
[355:12.52]And then I get to put on the monkey legs.
[355:13.82]Let's try it again.
[355:15.98]Lightning.
[355:29.58]Thankfully the internet has gotten back to normal.
[355:33.72]Alright, lightning one.
[355:34.65]A little zap.
[355:43.85]I'm gonna take a hit here, that's fine.
[355:45.21]I thought that you- the disk reading that you thought was my heavy breathing.
[356:07.53]Watch out for the fucking cave entrance.
[356:13.49]Oh boy.
[356:15.79]Like, I probably would have been able to trade blows back and forth.
[356:18.51]Why is that even in the game?
[356:21.57]I'll take- I can tank the hits at close.
[356:26.32]He's barely hurting me up close.
[356:28.82]He's dead.
[356:29.76]I win.
[356:29.96]Everyone thought I was gonna lose.
[356:31.06]You all thought I was done.
[356:31.86]You thought I lost.
[356:32.46]You thought the game was over.
[356:33.66]I win.
[356:37.07]And I'm gonna eat him.
[356:39.17]I just ate his whole body.
[356:41.23]That's gonna be at least, like, 500 points.
[356:42.33]And I'm just gonna touch the stones from Diablo.
[356:52.59]Teleport.
[356:53.09]Evolution.
[357:13.00]Oh!
[357:49.88]I'm not ready for this.
[357:50.64]Can I go back?
[357:51.40]I'm not ready.
[357:58.20]I can.
[358:07.16]Alright, let's try, maybe, let's, how, we haven't really done very much red.
[358:10.80]There's not been very much red at all.
[358:23.00]Arm 16.
[358:40.71]I'm 16.
[358:48.64]Too many.
[358:49.16]Too many dots.
[358:49.74]Too many.
[358:50.36]Green and white.
[358:59.13]Head 28.
[358:59.63]I need more body.
[359:07.64]I only have two bodies.
[359:13.36]Red and blue.
[359:26.74]There it is.
[359:27.22]Body 15.
[359:28.68]Perfect.
[359:29.96]Can do another one?
[359:31.42]I can do one more.
[359:37.80]Yellow and blue?
[359:38.42]Let's try yellow blue down here.
[359:41.60]Three yellows and then...
[359:44.44]Uh, blue T-pose.
[359:48.55]Head 13.
[359:49.23]Alright.
[359:51.27]Can you explain what you're doing right now?
[359:54.59]Well, uh, essentially, this game- I don't- I have no idea.
[359:57.89]I couldn't tell you if I tried.
[359:59.12]I have absolutely no explanation for what's happening in the game.
[360:06.32]How it works, I guess, is you have a grid.
[360:08.98]It's a DNA algorithm where you have stats.
[360:12.92]All the different colors are stats.
[360:15.01]You pick stats in the beginning of the game based on colors.
[360:19.85]Attack, for instance, like offense is red.
[360:22.83]Defense is blue.
[360:24.56]And then you use the grid here to make body parts when you get enough protein.
[360:30.06]Or EVP, especially protein.
[360:34.22]And then you put it together and then you make a body part, which you have... Whatever it is.
[360:39.71]Alright, so we've got lizard head, lizard rex.
[360:45.49]Crystal is the head, so lizard... Still can't put it on.
[360:53.47]I got new arms, too.
[360:54.31]Stab Scorpion, Electric Mollusk.
[360:56.77]I can do Scatter... No, I can't.
[360:59.30]Electric Mollusk and Demon.
[361:01.36]Electric Mollusk sounds kind of cool.
[361:03.76]That's a huge attack.
[361:08.64]Hammer Lobster.
[361:09.58]Well, that's quite a defense increase.
[361:13.39]And that's a much better heal.
[361:16.45]I'm gonna say... It's probably worth it.
[361:25.20]There's one more, right?
[361:27.88]Lizard Rex.
[361:31.09]I feel like I need a PhD to understand this.
[361:40.79]I feel like I... yeah.
[361:44.07]Let me just take a quick look.
[361:53.02]It's okay, the organisms here are idiots.
[362:00.99]They can't even hurt me.
[362:02.39]We're fine.
[362:06.61]Oh god, what's that?
[362:07.81]What's that thing?
[362:20.68]I do want more protein, though.
[362:25.82]It just... It seems so rare.
[362:30.28]What is this?
[362:30.82]I think it's another area.
[362:49.68]Yeah, we're out of the pond now guys.
[362:52.94]There's more than one zone.
[363:01.88]I'm gonna get so lost.
[363:11.93]Still no protein.
[363:20.53]Where's the protein?
[363:22.06]Anywhere?
[363:23.60]Come on.
[363:24.68]I'm dying here.
[363:32.57]There's another random little enemy.
[363:40.82]Oof.
[363:41.58]This is not going well here with the framerate.
[363:52.33]Spear nose?
[363:52.85]That barely hurts.
[363:56.83]Oh, no, no, no.
[363:58.45]Just attack.
[363:58.81]Attack.
[364:05.06]Nobody can hurt me.
[364:07.56]Am I over leveled?
[364:08.44]Here comes another one.
[364:29.35]Why did I... I just got really bored.
[364:32.49]Right now.
[364:32.93]It just happened right this second.
[364:50.50]Look at all these things.
[364:51.30]That guy hurts.
[364:54.69]Okay, I gotta run.
[365:18.97]Those guys hurt.
[365:22.01]A lot.
[365:25.30]Alright, I'm fine.
[365:35.22]BX power.
[365:35.94]Water 2.
[365:36.53]Here they come.
[365:42.57]They're still on the way.
[365:54.42]This game is depressing.
[365:59.06]If I could find some more protein, that would be a start.
[366:11.48]I'm just gonna keep going.
[366:13.60]At least straight here.
[366:17.85]They went too hard on the gas.
[366:19.61]You're in a pond.
[366:23.91]We were just walking around in the pond.
[366:25.85]And now all of a sudden, it's an expansive, gigantic ocean.
[366:30.61]With no end.
[366:37.19]Does the compass mean anything?
[366:40.31]I really have no idea.
[366:42.17]Somebody said earlier that it means that there's a food source or something.
[366:45.81]I haven't been able to figure out what the hell that means.
[366:54.52]Now we're going deep sea.
[366:57.90]Oh shit.
[367:00.60]Too deep.
[367:14.21]I need the level 20 flashlight head.
[367:16.39]I think this just might be the end of the game here.
[367:17.83]End of the world.
[367:23.54]I just want to put on the monkey legs.
[367:44.36]Monkey legs don't help if they're underwater.
[367:48.74]That's true.
[367:50.64]But in the same fashion...
[367:53.43]Don't... Doesn't somebody get a sub for five months if I got out of the water?
[368:02.62]Why is that the thing moving me forward?
[368:08.78]Is that protein?
[368:14.55]No.
[368:16.93]Damn it.
[368:20.82]Just swim up.
[368:22.20]I can't swim up.
[368:23.76]There's no scale there.
[368:28.33]Well, that was, uh... Super Evolution.
[368:32.93]I don't know what the game's called.
[368:39.37]Your protein gets drained when you recover HP.
[368:41.68]Does it really?
[368:51.16]You do not go on land in the whole game?
[368:54.13]Yes, you do.
[369:16.28]I guess that guy's not going to be subbing.
[369:19.50]Doesn't seem like it.
[369:21.72]It's okay.
[369:29.64]This game reminds me of the games my dad played in the 90s.
[369:32.32]Well, that's because it is a game that was made in the 90s.
[369:36.86]It's a 90s game.
[369:38.94]For 90s dads.
[369:47.15]Is there a reason why I can't pick that up?
[369:48.47]I need the monkey legs.
[369:49.23]Alright, well, if I can't reliably get some more protein to progress, I think we hit the point where it might be time to next the game.
[370:07.40]Interesting concept.
[370:09.44]Wish a game would come out like this that's current-gen.
[370:19.70]Thank god.
[370:20.78]What?
[370:22.12]This was fun.
[370:22.72]I had a good time.
[370:34.19]It was worth it.
[370:45.14]So, we have a couple options here.
[370:50.52]That was EVP 14.
[370:53.46]No, it's not.
[370:53.94]That's what the screen says.
[370:57.48]Shield your eyes.
[370:58.04]No, it's not.
[370:59.02]I got it.
[371:02.28]I turned off the stream to watch paint dry.
[371:06.33]And it wasn't as exciting as what I was just doing.
[371:18.74]So, there are a couple of survival horror games that remain.
[371:24.27]There are... Tony Hawk is going to be a long time.
[371:26.89]I don't think I'm going to do Tony Hawk.
[371:28.27]I think I'm going to... I think I'm just going to play Tony Hawk 2 tomorrow.
[371:32.21]Like, I'm just going to play the game.
[371:33.17]I'm just going to beat Tony Hawk 2.
[371:37.16]That's going to be at least a few hours.
[371:44.06]Blue Stinger is a survival horror game, I believe.
[371:54.42]Power Stone?
[371:55.04]I still got Power Stone as well.
[371:59.26]Why is this sealed so strangely?
[372:07.75]How can one single piece of tape be this powerful?
[372:12.17]What was that game that I just played right now?
[372:13.95]That was... That's not... It's not the Floygan Brothers.
[372:17.03]I just took it out.
[372:18.75]That was called Seventh Cross Evolution.
[372:22.92]Seventh Cross Evolution.
[372:29.86]Steins Gate.
[372:38.07]I'm not going to snap the disk.
[372:39.23]All these games were at least like, at least like $20 to $40 each.
[372:44.17]I'm not snapping a $40 piece of plastic.
[372:48.95]Maybe not that one.
[372:53.98]Nope, nope, nope, nope, nope, nope.
[372:55.22]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[372:56.90]I'm not doing that.
[372:59.17]I need to go remove shit from this.
[373:07.31]Alright, let's see.
[373:08.19]File.
[373:11.42]So, we've got... NHL 2K Saved Season.
[373:17.82]From the year 2000.
[373:18.72]Okay, we need to get rid of that.
[373:25.27]Uh... Star Wars Episode I Jedi Power Battles.
[373:34.92]There is a Pac-Man in here somehow.
[373:38.50]Get rid of that.
[373:38.96]This is ECW.
[373:43.34]Who's going to play that ever again?
[373:44.48]Namco Museum.
[373:45.84]High score.
[373:48.00]We need these blocks.
[373:48.86]I'm sorry, guys.
[373:49.48]This is Ready to Rumble Boxing.
[373:54.47]Mike.
[373:55.35]Okay.
[373:58.69]And then this is just save game options for Ready to Rumble Boxing.
[374:07.38]What do you mean, stop?
[374:30.20]What is this asking me to do?
[374:41.92]What does this have to do with a save game wipe?
[374:57.07]Oh, there's a fork and knife.
[374:57.97]Okay, I get it.
[374:58.37]Alright, we're free.
[375:03.19]Ready to go.
[375:04.89]This is Blue Stinger.
[375:07.39]It's gonna be so fun.
[375:10.30]Let me pee one more time while this game loads.
[375:14.49]Actually, no, let me get to the menu first.
[375:29.10]Haha, so fun.
[375:30.14]Yeah.
[375:33.00]It's going to be fun.
[375:33.44]What are you talking about?
[375:41.42]Climax Graphics is the company.
[375:51.18]Blue Stinger.
[375:58.09]1999.
[376:01.51]So, just give me a moment.
[376:03.37]This will probably end up being the last thing we do tonight.
[376:07.53]Because it is getting to be a little bit later.
[376:11.72]been about six and a half hours on stream probably gonna go for about seven to eight and we'll pick it up again tomorrow and I'm gonna play the absolute shit out of Tony Hawk I'll show you a 1 million point string of tricks you don't think I know how to do manuals we're gonna go back I'm gonna complete the floor again brothers just kidding that's not gonna happen I'll
[379:00.71]Alright.
[379:04.29]Blue Stinger.
[379:09.57]What's going on?
[379:15.94]He's breathing.
[379:24.58]Just gonna say, what?
[379:28.88]What did I do?
[379:29.78]You didn't say you were leaving.
[379:33.06]Didn't I say I had to go pee?
[379:35.40]And I'll be right back?
[379:37.94]I said I have to pee and I'll be right back.
[379:50.51]I cut myself off.
[379:52.01]What did you think I was going to say?
[379:55.17]I don't have a game.
[379:56.13]What are the options?
[379:57.96]Difficulty, that's fine.
[379:59.30]Blue Stinger!
[380:01.10]You were talking about Floygan.
[380:04.85]Alright, cutscene, cutscene.
[380:05.69]You guys are quiet.
[380:06.13]Is it cutscene?
[380:06.59]Hold on.
[380:27.46]Alright.
[380:29.32]I glanced away from the screen and I turned back.
[380:31.02]I didn't expect that helicopter was just gonna drive into the ground.
[380:36.18]I'm not a pilot of that helicopter.
[380:37.48]Did I just ghost ride it into the ground?
[380:43.41]Nice sneakers, too.
[380:45.97]I skipped it?
[380:46.67]I didn't skip anything!
[380:48.83]I didn't skip any cutscenes!
[380:50.45]What?!
[380:53.13]I did not skip the intro!
[381:10.89]Those sneakers absolutely look like they made out of chocolate Those don't even look like real shoes Analog I feel like this game's gonna be fun.
[381:32.63]Let's go
[381:34.74]Follow the, uh... Press the start button?
[381:38.94]This is Elliot Balad, EASER Troop C-730.
[381:41.52]This is Janine King, KISS Dinosaur Island Security Office.
[381:46.87]Currently, the island is under an emergency situation.
[381:50.05]Do you read?
[381:50.97]Dispatch G-7 equipped right now.
[381:52.51]The location is... I fucking forget to mute the mic.
[381:57.20]I hate that noise just as much.
[381:58.62]I got cut off.
[381:59.28]Hmm.
[382:05.85]Alright, I'm Elliot with one L. Oh, it's Brutus.
[382:24.18]Oh, that guy's not here.
[382:26.14]Is that intentional?
[382:28.38]You found Small Hassy.
[382:34.31]What was the point of that guy?
[382:41.30]That's it.
[382:41.88]He's just stalking me.
[382:44.15]But apparently he's not.
[382:49.16]Alright, through the front door, let's go.
[382:50.96]Another codec call.
[382:52.38]Who is it?
[382:52.78]Same dev is ill-bleed.
[382:54.50]Look at the story about ill-bleed.
[382:56.32]On vacation.
[383:17.69]Yeah, my favorite pastime.
[383:20.01]Jumping out of helicopters and crashing them into the ground.
[383:22.33]I love it.
[383:23.31]What happened to her?
[383:24.19]Where?
[383:48.26]More diarrhea cramp sounds.
[383:51.08]What's with all the Dreamcast games and everybody having stomach ache problems?
[383:55.22]Okay.
[383:59.15]Oh no, corpses!
[384:05.69]Oh my, I'll call you back.
[384:09.35]You found a credit card.
[384:15.95]Is there a sprint?
[384:29.25]What does my shirt say?
[384:32.29]They're gonna get up.
[384:33.35]I thought this was a survival horror game.
[384:38.74]I guess it technically is.
[384:44.91]Except... I'm gonna make a reference here.
[384:46.71]No, don't make that reference.
[384:49.29]People are gonna be like, what?
[384:50.41]And then some people are gonna be like, whoa!
[384:52.41]Speaking of... Okay, that's... This is a... Yeah, it is.
[384:57.06]Oh my god!
[384:58.18]Okay, that was fucking scary.
[385:00.18]No sound, no noise.
[385:02.26]No sound effects.
[385:03.54]Just scary.
[385:13.94]That's a Mortal Kombat 1 amount of blood.
[385:22.31]The parental controls are turned off in the options menu.
[385:25.15]Really?
[385:26.65]That door's locked, I have the key though, right?
[385:40.77]Yeah, your level 4 arms couldn't save you.
[385:43.02]Level 2 arms.
[385:55.94]Jesus!
[385:59.67]The monster just got way, way cooler.
[386:02.55]Oh, there he is.
[386:03.03]There's fuckin' Wario.
[386:07.41]With those shorts.
[386:10.60]That was close.
[386:12.08]Thanks for helping me.
[386:13.26]My name is Elliot G. Balad.
[386:15.92]Where's Tim?
[386:17.94]Breaking every rule in filmmaking.
[386:19.45]Who are you?
[386:20.23]Dogs.
[386:21.53]I'm a captain of the SS Deanna.
[386:23.97]If you're Elliot, you must be with Tim.
[386:26.53]Breaking every single rule.
[386:28.23]Tim is what?
[386:29.89]Dead?
[386:30.36]You're looking in the same part of the screen.
[386:33.00]I don't know.
[386:33.82]I don't know?
[386:35.78]Is that Acer's answer?
[386:38.73]You know, Tim once told me he had a high-level ESER member as a friend.
[386:44.48]Where are you going?
[386:45.72]To the island.
[386:46.90]I am still a rescuer.
[386:48.40]There are people there who need help.
[386:51.16]What a joke.
[386:51.86]Just change the 180 degrees?
[386:53.52]Obviously.
[386:53.96]Why would the camera do that?
[386:55.17]Good help.
[386:56.03]Like me.
[386:56.45]I can't let a wimp like you go alone.
[386:59.53]Whatever.
[386:59.97]Uh...
[387:10.30]The guy's a magician.
[387:11.71]He's just gone.
[387:16.77]He seems to have that ability, somehow.
[387:19.99]You wimp, you'll never make it by yourself.
[387:25.45]Fucking puff of smoke underneath him.
[387:34.85]Go back to the freezer aisle.
[387:38.11]Keep selling fish sticks.
[387:41.41]Gordon.
[387:42.51]How do I get in here?
[387:48.87]That ID card doesn't work?
[387:50.15]Oh, okay.
[387:59.09]Alright, we got some more... Dead space enemies.
[388:02.67]Magazine of Arrows.
[388:06.01]Okay.
[388:07.36]Not gonna stand up.
[388:12.34]This is already ten times better than the last game.
[388:16.50]He just appeared next to me.
[388:21.44]Kill it!
[388:39.49]Is it inceptioning something into my brain here?
[388:45.04]Sell all of your stocks.
[388:56.08]Nephilim.
[388:58.84]What the hell is that?
[389:01.01]It was a Nephilim.
[389:02.63]I'm not sure.
[389:04.71]Oh, I have a bad feeling about this.
[389:10.27]Bye.
[389:11.89]See ya.
[389:17.23]It's just Deckard Cain.
[389:18.41]Uh-oh!
[389:20.75]Monster mutant!
[389:21.61]How do I drink the, uh... Do I have an inventory?
[389:41.87]I guess I do items food small hassey would you like to have a small hassey sure
[389:59.73]Oh, what was the funny Illbleed story?
[390:01.11]Oh, sorry.
[390:02.39]This game kind of just threw me off for a second there.
[390:04.19]So, Illbleed is like almost $100.
[390:05.81]And I had to cut it because I was thinking of... Okay, we'll do a Dreamcast night, see how people feel.
[390:14.08]I think Illbleed is like $70 or $80.
[390:15.84]Nothing in that realm.
[390:25.55]I don't have a card.
[390:38.78]It's my character from the Evolution game.
[390:42.31]I'm gonna get revenge.
[390:43.17]No.
[390:44.21]It's just dead.
[390:48.63]I am not skipping cutscenes.
[390:50.83]No shit.
[390:51.26]Janine?
[391:11.87]This is Janine, over.
[391:12.90]This is Janine, over.
[391:15.56]You're great.
[391:16.52]If you're an ESER member, you'll definitely be ranked A+.
[391:20.00]You're flattering me, but you won't get anywhere that way.
[391:24.38]You can get in here by taking the slope shuttle in front of you.
[391:27.63]If the shuttle is moving, that is.
[391:29.55]And forget it if you don't have an ID card.
[391:32.73]Oh, where am I gonna get an ID card?
[391:41.33]Tough girl.
[391:42.49]I like it, Janine.
[391:44.85]Who the hell is Janine?
[391:46.89]My kind of girl, so stay away from her.
[391:52.50]Uh... That's, um... You literally just had a conversation.
[392:00.22]You just saw her from a distance.
[392:03.89]And... I believe that was four sentences.
[392:08.99]I think you might want to pump the brakes just a little bit.
[392:12.09]Door's locked.
[392:22.51]I need a keycard.
[392:32.44]Gate check.
[392:34.00]Door locked.
[392:36.74]We don't have the car to open this door.
[392:46.00]Push the old guy off.
[392:49.66]Ah.
[392:51.50]He's not on the screen.
[392:56.40]Did I miss something over here?
[393:02.25]The door is locked.
[393:15.34]Change character.
[393:17.40]This guy's name is Dogs.
[393:29.29]So... Do I have the key?
[393:34.80]This guy- I thought he was just wearing socks.
[393:50.06]Um... Am I stuck here?
[393:54.95]Wasting ammo?
[393:55.85]I don't see anything... I mean, a map or something?
[394:06.23]No, there's no info here.
[394:07.41]I mean, is this... I don't think he has the key for this.
[394:19.57]Door's locked.
[394:21.01]There's really only one way to go.
[394:23.31]In his defense, everybody wore jorts back in the 90s.
[394:41.02]I'm not so certain they did.
[394:43.54]I don't think they did.
[394:52.74]Well, I did.
[394:53.80]This door is locked.
[395:01.15]Scan your eyes?
[395:07.71]There's nowhere else to go.
[395:18.26]Is there anything else back here?
[395:22.70]What just happened?
[395:41.81]Uh, I guess I'm gonna go this way.
[395:50.49]No, I don't wear shorts.
[396:02.43]Where is this?
[396:02.95]Where's this door?
[396:04.03]There was a room?
[396:06.49]Okay, to the right?
[396:10.70]Bridge tunnel.
[396:11.80]Tunnel one.
[396:21.13]Is there a place to the right over here?
[396:32.79]I mean, this is the beginning of the game.
[396:35.01]I don't have an indicator on the screen.
[396:38.86]Let me look at the map.
[396:43.18]Do I have a... Is there a blip that's supposed to be me?
[396:46.73]I don't think it... I don't think it exists.
[396:50.17]Uh...
[397:12.21]Shit!
[397:13.01]Okay, um... Come on!
[397:24.28]Where's this room that I didn't go in?
[397:27.46]It's not here.
[397:28.20]Can we go back to the ring?
[397:38.55]No, not tonight.
[397:52.43]No, not this way.
[397:53.29]No, right.
[397:53.85]Okay.
[397:54.01]We're just gonna keep going Continue forward with it push the crate to the right this crate
[398:26.99]Why would anyone ever do this?
[398:35.92]Why would you ever move this?
[398:37.28]Why would you even look at this crate?
[398:50.40]He really is Wario.
[398:51.60]Yeah, he just went like...
[398:56.69]There's more than one item up there.
[399:01.16]Visitor ID.
[399:02.54]A gun.
[399:10.06]There's lockers.
[399:10.66]This is very claustrophobic.
[399:11.98]Do you want to turn to download the map?
[399:14.23]Uh, yeah.
[399:17.81]Okay, download complete.
[399:21.21]I got the map now.
[399:22.13]And there were two items up there, somebody said.
[399:56.08]There you go.
[399:58.06]So there's another thing.
[399:58.70]What is this?
[400:00.82]He found a handgun magazine.
[400:02.24]Okay.
[400:02.51]Alright.
[400:05.23]Let's go.
[400:06.51]Now I can move on.
[400:29.30]Blue Stinger.
[400:32.12]Move on to the next game.
[400:33.46]Hold on, I just... I'm almost about to go through the first door I haven't been able to go through.
[400:37.84]I don't have the key.
[400:41.84]Is it the door over this way?
[400:44.47]No, I'm not done.
[400:54.91]That's breaking the rule.
[401:02.49]There we go.
[401:03.35]Through the door.
[401:04.13]Alright, there's, like, tendrils.
[401:10.15]Alright, got it.
[401:31.72]This music is gonna drive me crazy.
[401:33.48]What's with these Dreamcast games?
[401:36.06]And their EDF soundtracks.
[401:52.37]Can't open this one.
[401:57.81]Or fan-made Star Wars themes.
[402:02.75]There's a huge keypad right here.
[402:04.08]The person's gonna get up?
[402:12.02]What's that?
[402:12.74]A magazine of arrows, that's good.
[402:15.84]Do you want to download the map?
[402:17.32]Yes.
[402:23.72]Vending machines?
[402:24.89]Display contents of VI- oh, it's a save point.
[402:27.03]Do you want to- yes, I do want to save.
[402:33.26]It really is Wario.
[402:42.79]Select the item you want to buy.
[402:46.65]A hot dog is $120.
[402:48.20]Hamburger $160.
[402:48.74]Or a hassi is $60.
[402:49.14]Okay.
[403:02.89]It's an expensive hot dog.
[403:05.23]God damn it, now I want a hot dog.
[403:06.67]I'm hungry now.
[403:17.44]I got the map.
[403:18.62]Where the hell am I?
[403:32.28]Brain area?
[403:34.95]Brain.
[403:47.08]This door isn't locked.
[403:47.90]It can't be unlocked.
[403:49.94]So I went in that way.
[403:52.96]This door is locked, so I have to go this way.
[404:00.65]Control room.
[404:06.64]Okay, I threw up the other party member.
[404:10.82]Emergency alert.
[404:12.14]Shuttle section should be stationed.
[404:15.28]Emergency alert.
[404:16.48]Shuttle section should be stationed.
[404:18.12]How long have I been in Davis?
[404:19.14]Just about four months now.
[404:20.60]Negative pressure on the shuttle holder system has increased 20%.
[404:23.52]The security limitation is exceeded on shuttle system.
[404:29.75]Security break has been activated.
[404:32.88]Shutter outer seal has been broken.
[404:34.95]Once shuttle reaches security limitation stage, shuttle may descend rapidly.
[404:43.47]Hey, somebody is on board.
[404:45.78]He's locked up in the shuttle.
[404:50.59]Activate the emergency stop control the soundy break will be destroyed I've played a couple times now that on the shaft entrance lock has been that's the stock sounds that I Activate the emergency stop control safety brake will be destroyed in 125 seconds a shaft entrance lock has been deactivated Activate the emergency stop control safety brake will be destroyed in 120 seconds a shaft entrance lock has been deactivated a
[405:16.91]That is the Bugleberry.
[405:17.71]Let's see.
[405:18.23]I got a time limit.
[405:19.63]Fuck.
[405:19.95]What do I have to do?
[405:34.41]I was trying to find a scream.
[405:56.74]This door is unlocked.
[405:57.34]Okay.
[405:57.68]Out.
[406:06.59]Dodge.
[406:16.58]Nice nonchalant running.
[406:23.52]There's lots of blood.
[406:26.79]These huge pratfalls.
[406:28.97]That looks painful.
[406:30.33]Almost there.
[406:37.31]What?
[406:43.63]Uh... Wasn't supposed to go there, apparently.
[406:53.20]This... I don't do anything here?
[406:58.00]I don't climb up this or anything?
[406:59.47]Nothing?
[406:59.85]Oh...
[407:31.76]Just put him in the pocket for a little while.
[407:38.40]So that was the wrong way.
[407:39.25]Let's see.
[407:39.59]Five, four, three, two, one.
[408:10.94]What was that?
[408:11.40]Was that supposed to happen?
[408:13.14]Why was there a countdown for that?
[408:14.68]Uh...
[408:35.12]I guess, um... That was supposed to happen.
[408:45.85]So I walked all the way up here.
[408:47.13]I was supposed to stop it?
[409:04.38]The Dreamcast fucking sucks laughing my ass off.
[409:07.76]I don't know why that's making me laugh so hard.
[409:11.44]Why?
[409:11.74]It doesn't though.
[409:25.43]The Dreamcast is a great system.
[409:28.65]We didn't even play Tony Hawk yet.
[409:46.35]Dynamite Cop was awesome, you can't deny that.
[410:24.39]Listen, we didn't even play Shenmue, Shenmue 2, Sonic Adventure, Space Channel 5, Crazy Taxi, all of which were ported and run way better on PC now.
[410:41.97]But they were on Dreamcast a long time ago.
[410:46.31]That's what matters.
[410:55.93]What do I have to do here?
[411:02.77]Okay.
[411:03.51]Shuttle A is deactivated.
[411:10.50]What is it?
[411:11.32]Shuttle B is deactivated now.
[411:13.12]Am I gonna get another timer?
[411:21.09]Please just let the Death Star blow up already.
[411:31.90]Alright, this door is locked.
[411:33.44]How do I open the door?
[411:40.12]Was that actually- Alright, I gotta calm down.
[411:42.45]Hold on.
[411:49.43]Let me- Just give me a second.
[411:55.18]I can't- I can't mute the music.
[411:59.16]It's impossible.
[412:00.02]I have to mute the whole game.
[412:24.00]Okay.
[412:28.99]I can't get it out of my head.
[412:29.87]I can't get it out.
[412:37.11]Okay.
[412:42.04]Okay.
[412:43.54]So, do I have to reload the save?
[413:16.28]I don't know why this is doing to me so hard.
[413:19.62]I'm sorry.
[413:20.40]I don't know why.
[413:21.38]Let me heal.
[413:25.52]No, I don't want to... I'm going to just get the other guy.
[413:29.33]I'm so sorry.
[413:29.97]I don't know why this is happening right now.
[413:37.17]Okay.
[413:38.11]I'm gonna backtrack.
[413:43.69]My god.
[413:44.25]Okay.
[413:44.71]So, that fell down.
[413:47.47]Therefore... I'm gonna turn the music down.
[413:56.92]I'm gonna mute...
[414:20.94]Alright.
[414:24.62]So, I downloaded some new maps.
[414:32.54]We got brain area.
[414:34.64]Let me look.
[414:35.21]So, that's... Where was... I'm gonna go check the tunnel that I was in again.
[414:44.63]Okay.
[414:45.15]I'll try.
[414:45.89]Check that sloped tunnel again.
[414:47.09]Okay.
[414:54.01]I should've... Why did I get this instead of Illbleed?
[415:19.80]It's making me laugh so hard because...
[415:24.67]I could just smell the boredom coming from that person's comment.
[415:30.74]These are the games that are being shown.
[415:32.54]And if you've never seen the Dreamcast, you've never heard of it before, this sucks.
[415:38.48]But there's so much more.
[415:40.32]Dreamcast is a great system.
[415:44.13]There are actually at least ten games that are really fantastic genre-defining experiences.
[415:56.45]But anyways, check the slope tunnel again.
[416:04.27]Name three Shenmue.
[416:06.15]Shenmue, Power Stone, and DYNAMITE COMP!
[416:24.15]How do I get out of this?
[416:29.91]I have to push the crate up the slope?
[416:32.87]What crate?
[416:36.06]Do something!
[416:36.88]I'm so- I- I don't understand!
[416:39.36]I- The timer ran out and I have nothing to do!
[416:41.58]There's a ladder?
[416:56.05]Where's the ladder?
[417:09.93]On the right side?
[417:10.71]I just passed the ladder on the right side.
[417:39.60]There's a ladder up all the way at the top.
[417:51.31]I got my sound muted.
[417:52.33]Why is he running?
[417:53.21]Okay, I see a ladder here.
[417:57.41]It's just like, you're talking about the most chameleon ladder I've ever seen.
[418:03.60]Let's go, let's go, let's go, let's go.
[418:14.97]A shuttle is out of order.
[418:20.59]Okay.
[418:21.85]We're gonna progress.
[418:30.58]Oh my god.
[418:33.28]Pull?
[418:34.24]Just keep walking?
[418:43.64]Where the hell did I end up?
[418:45.38]What the f- where did you come from?
[418:46.96]I'm gonna have to drink that large hasi in a second.
[419:01.65]Are you gonna- is he gonna kill me?
[419:03.09]You killed me.
[419:18.93]Can't get out of here.
[419:21.07]Oh, yeah, I can No, I think I got to get this game up I
[419:46.10]No, this game's not... This game's fun.
[419:51.72]You give games too many chances.
[419:53.68]No, this is a fun experience.
[419:55.50]It's a genre-defining experience.
[419:58.62]Has it... It's been 40 minutes.
[420:02.10]God damn it.
[420:03.40]Has it actually... Okay.
[420:18.28]This genre sucks.
[420:20.47]No, it doesn't.
[420:21.71]Tony Hawk Pro Skater 2 is best played on the SEGA Dreamcast.
[420:26.31]When it came out, it was at the best graphics, it played the best, had the best control system.
[420:35.28]Look, I don't want to play the whole cart, you know?
[420:38.20]I told you at the beginning of the stream, I got an ace, I got a queen, and I got a ten.
[420:43.64]I don't want you to see the king or the Jack right here.
[420:48.57]No, actually, this is the Ace and the King.
[420:50.81]Power Stone and Tony Hawk 2 are probably the best games on the system.
[421:01.30]You've been playing Uno cards.
[421:05.94]No, this one's going to take a while.
[421:09.81]So what did we go through tonight?
[421:12.01]It's also been seven hours.
[421:20.14]Let me just double check to see for tomorrow.
[421:22.14]Let me take a look.
[421:24.44]We've got an ace, a king, a queen.
[421:29.71]We've got two terrible games.
[421:33.01]And then one more survival horror.
[421:37.13]Okay.
[421:38.71]I'm going to call it here.
[421:40.37]Because it's getting later.
[421:42.61]It's been about seven hours.
[421:46.90]Seaman also, I want to, I didn't address Seaman.
[421:50.08]I did a couple times, but I want to do it again.
[421:52.58]I was supposed to play Seaman tonight.
[421:55.81]But the microphone did not come in the package where I bought it from.
[422:00.31]They sent me, they missed, it was missing.
[422:04.21]And it explicitly stated the microphone was in the package.
[422:07.75]So, I have to get it again.
[422:09.30]I have to reorder it.
[422:13.96]Anywho,
[422:17.14]It has to be a specific mic.
[422:19.26]If only one mic works, it's the one you plug in to the VMU slot.
[422:32.90]That was a pretty good C- stream.
[422:36.44]At least it wasn't an F. I'll take that.
[422:48.68]Jerma got scammed.
[422:50.44]No, I bought it through Amazon.
[422:59.31]I had fun.
[423:00.29]Dynamite Cop is actually one of the better arcade games.
[423:03.99]I think that was a blast.
[423:06.50]What else did we play?
[423:08.20]ECW was terrible.
[423:11.34]Seventh Cross had potential and it was fun for a little while.
[423:14.78]Floygan Brothers was terrible but was still interesting.
[423:19.64]The Ring was barely even a playable video game.
[423:26.08]Flagon was like alright.
[423:27.31]Yeah, it was.
[423:29.05]So tomorrow, we got the Ace and the King.
[423:31.93]We got the real games lined up for tomorrow.
[423:37.13]Power Stone, Tony Hawk 2.
[423:38.45]I'm going to put a ton of time into Tony Hawk 2.
[423:41.05]So be prepared for tomorrow's stream to be Tony Hawk's Pro Skater 2 for like four to six hours.
[423:49.72]And then we'll go through some of these other ones.
[423:57.52]All too good Dreamcast games.
[424:06.01]And, by the way, all the other great, like Shenmue, Jet Set Radio, Space Channel 5, I own them on PC.
[424:17.37]So, they're still going to happen.
[424:19.90]It's just, I kind of need to get through the ones that are connected to the actual console.
[424:25.78]Because once these are done, we can move on, like SEGA Bass, yeah, it's on Steam.
[424:29.86]There's a whole package on Steam.
[424:32.47]I own them all.
[424:34.78]But I have to kind of do these first.
[424:38.84]So we're kind of going through a little bit of the garbage can first.
[424:41.96]And some other classic ones that are not available anywhere else.
[424:49.34]But I still had a lot of fun.
[424:53.46]It's something oddly satisfying and interesting to go through old games that you've never really seen or played before.
[425:04.02]It's a different era.
[425:05.66]I like it.
[425:06.00]I like just putting the disk in and what do we get?
[425:08.28]It's like a little Forrest Gump box of chocolates.
[425:12.48]You just never know.
[425:16.40]Sometimes you get like three or four duds in a row.
[425:18.97]Sometimes there's a really good one in there.
[425:20.19]So we're going to go over the bits.
[425:27.06]And then when we're done with Dreamcast stuff, which will probably be after tomorrow, there'll probably be only a couple left.
[425:37.29]Oh, what do you guys think?
[425:37.95]Should I start with, like, should I start with the rest of the dog shit and then move into, like, the good ones?
[425:41.73]Or should I start with Tony Hawk?
[425:44.93]And just play Tony Hawk.
[425:45.77]I'm trying to figure that out.
[425:55.05]No, yeah, that makes sense.
[425:55.89]Start with dog shit and then go from terrible games to, okay, and now here's like, that was like a couple hours, there they go, and now we're gonna play Tony Hawk for the rest of the night.
[426:06.18]That makes sense.
[426:13.60]You can only go up at that point, yeah.
[426:16.54]Alright, let's do the bits and the subs.
[426:18.29]Thanks everybody for watching.
[426:22.05]It's always an interesting time.
[426:26.45]If you stick around, awesome.
[426:28.80]If not, then I will see you hopefully tomorrow.
[426:32.96]Probably around the same time, 3ish p.m.
[426:35.14]Pacific.
[426:38.40]And let me get my bits open.
[426:46.58]Oh, Resident Evil 2 Remake is gonna start once we're done with the Dreamcast stuff.
[426:52.11]At least the physical Dreamcast stuff.
[426:54.57]So after tomorrow, I'm assuming I'll be done with all the physical stuff.
[426:59.78]And then that brings us to, what, Friday?
[427:03.64]Today's Saturday.
[427:04.88]That'll bring us to Sunday.
[427:06.62]So I'll probably start Resident Evil 2 Remake on Monday.
[427:15.91]But... Thanks for watching.
[427:20.61]Sometimes you guys just do it to me, man.
[427:23.20]That shit was... I don't know why that one comment made me fucking laugh so hard.
[427:27.22]It was like I couldn't even control myself anymore.
[427:31.48]So many things are going through my mind.
[427:38.45]I'm gonna be laughing about that in bed tonight.
[427:41.03]I'm just gonna be lying there with my iPad just looking at like Reddit or something and it's just gonna happen.
[427:49.18]Anyways.
[427:54.89]I hope you guys had a good time.
[427:55.89]I hope it was interesting enough.
[427:58.35]If it wasn't, then we'll try again tomorrow.
[428:06.99]Okay.
[428:12.78]So, let's go back to earlier tonight.
[428:18.45]We have Dala from Dr. Steen.
[428:20.50]What are the planned streams for the near future after Dreamcast and Resident Evil?
[428:25.89]Oh, that's a good question.
[428:27.47]I really leave it kind of up in the air.
[428:30.91]I usually try to plan out a couple weeks of streams.
[428:35.44]So when I have a day off, I usually try to sit there and think of, hey, what can we do?
[428:40.96]What's something fun to do this week or next week or something?
[428:43.62]Obviously a major game release ties into that.
[428:47.91]But there are a lot of requests people have.
[428:49.61]There's a lot of recommendations that they could fit in.
[428:58.63]I was always curious about Blue Stinger and interested.
[429:01.63]Yeah, but that's... You've got to remember, this is not like the best representation of the game.
[429:08.76]Because obviously, it's very old.
[429:11.94]And there's probably so much more after it and... Maybe I'll try to jump back into it again tomorrow.
[429:20.34]Because it's definitely worth playing, I think.
[429:23.78]Maybe.
[429:26.76]The music's a little too loud, but it's okay.
[429:31.77]But after that, after Dreamcast, after Resident Evil 2, I don't know.
[429:38.30]There's a couple of small projects and larger projects that I want to try to do and get done at some point before the spring.
[429:45.52]Which will be fun.
[429:46.95]And you'll find out more about those a little bit later.
[429:48.83]There's also the movie Encore Night.
[429:52.41]The green screen Encore Night is what I mean.
[429:53.91]I want to get that set up too over the next couple weeks.
[429:57.67]But I don't plan out the three, four weeks or month out of streams.
[430:02.69]They kind of just, whatever I feel like doing is what I usually feel like doing.
[430:08.44]But, uh, thank you to Dr. Steen.
[430:10.05]Thank you.
[430:10.35]Trust no one for the $1.
[430:12.75]Hello there, Jeremy.
[430:13.61]I can clearly see that you've had such a chill and pleasant stream today.
[430:16.85]It's so nice and sweet.
[430:17.87]Yes, indeed.
[430:18.45]However, please never forget that life is pain and you hate it.
[430:21.80]Let me remind you of that.
[430:22.76]Let me remind you.
[430:25.44]Actually, let me turn off the Dreamcast so I don't get like that.
[430:32.02]There.
[430:32.58]Now you can hear me clearly.
[430:39.48]Let's see.
[430:41.45]Let's get reminded.
[430:49.61]What the hell is this?
[430:50.43]This is Jerma985's only competent Dark Souls streamer of 2019.
[431:00.43]Oh no.
[431:05.33]I love how you're the only competent soul streamer I've seen this year.
[431:10.51]That means a lot, considering I've struggled a lot with this game when I first played it.
[431:15.50]Wow, what a confidence boost.
[431:18.18]Thank you for that.
[431:18.82]Seriously, that was a super confidence boost.
[431:21.10]I can do anything now.
[431:22.78]I'm capable of anything.
[431:24.61]Oh, I'm facing the wrong fucking direction!
[431:26.62]Ayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayayay
[431:51.07]suck my bum come on come on first person holy it's so hard god it's unbearable Jesus Christ it's too much it's too much to handle
[432:11.49]The distance.
[432:16.35]The distance.
[432:17.63]It's hard to tell what the distance is.
[432:23.10]I lost my mind.
[432:24.52]I don't know why I continued to do it.
[432:27.46]I told you I was going to beat it first fucking try.
[432:46.03]That was a great video, first of all.
[432:50.32]Second of all, dirtiest NFL cheap shots?
[432:55.20]I don't want to watch that right now, no.
[433:00.09]That was very hard.
[433:01.29]That's one of the hardest things ever.
[433:04.09]The dodging and the, I don't even need to explain it.
[433:13.28]Too many emotions on that stream.
[433:19.18]But thank you for that.
[433:19.96]That was great.
[433:20.78]It was Trust No One.
[433:22.18]And here's the link to that video if you'd like to watch it.
[433:33.09]Thank you.
[433:34.89]Thank you to Future Gamer for the $1.
[433:36.03]Do you ever get those gluten tests back?
[433:38.01]No, I actually have not.
[433:40.52]I have to go back to the doctor to get them back.
[433:44.01]And I had a series of... I had a shitload of things come back.
[433:48.41]But the doctor that I have right now is... I can't get them over the phone.
[433:54.18]So I actually have to physically go in for a doctor's appointment because they won't tell me the results over the phone.
[434:00.12]So it's like, okay.
[434:01.96]So I got to make a new appointment and go back in.
[434:03.92]And I haven't done that in the last week and a half or so.
[434:06.70]So I got to go back.
[434:13.26]But everything else was great.
[434:14.52]I had a lot of other tests to make sure that nothing else was going on.
[434:17.34]And... All my blood work was okay.
[434:21.04]There was some... I had some high calcium.
[434:22.71]Like, I don't know if you guys remember.
[434:24.97]I brought it up maybe like three or four months ago.
[434:27.83]I had a fairly high blood calcium.
[434:30.37]For no reason.
[434:34.01]And I guess... There's like... Oh, make sure you keep an eye on that.
[434:39.56]And I had...
[434:41.70]another couple of tests done, and over the last couple of months, it hasn't really gone any higher.
[434:46.88]It's receded back a little bit, so it's not a problem anymore.
[434:51.90]So that's good.
[434:53.14]But everything else is fine.
[434:54.09]I'm just gonna try to find out if I'm intolerant.
[434:57.27]I did a full food allergy panel, so we'll see.
[435:03.91]Kidneys are fine.
[435:05.43]Kidneys are fine.
[435:06.09]Liver is fine.
[435:06.73]Everything's pretty much perfectly fine.
[435:11.78]But I appreciate the concern.
[435:12.64]Thank you, Future Gamer.
[435:15.02]And all of you, everyone, obviously, with the love in the chat, that's... Thank you.
[435:18.49]Appreciate it.
[435:20.49]Hack it fast, thanks for the $1.
[435:21.85]Jet set or choo-choo rocket?
[435:23.35]Also, I eat ass.
[435:24.99]Well, that's on you.
[435:25.91]That's for you to do and decide if that's what you're gonna do.
[435:29.03]Hey, Pigeon, thanks for the $1.
[435:32.73]They say, if you decide against it, it's none of my business, and I'm okay with that.
[435:36.00]Thanks for the great content.
[435:36.86]Keep it up.
[435:38.18]Changed my name recently.
[435:40.06]Oh, okay.
[435:42.55]Uh, what is this?
[435:46.37]The SEGA Dreamcast microphone, yeah.
[435:53.27]That's the worst part about the things I bought.
[435:56.47]So, I bought Seaman.
[436:00.49]And it was very expensive.
[436:02.41]It was an embarrassing amount of money to pay for something.
[436:08.19]And when it did not come with the microphone, I was like, number one, somebody might be trying to scam me.
[436:16.08]Or number two, they just forgot.
[436:19.00]But I did a refund through Amazon, and apparently it worked, so I just have to send it back.
[436:30.83]But The Fate of Seaman, you will see it.
[436:34.72]Just not within the next couple of days.
[436:36.34]I'm just going to load it up one day.
[436:38.76]And just play it for like an hour and just fuck around.
[436:40.44]But Pigeon, thank you for the $2 here.
[436:50.43]It's some more links to the microphone stuff.
[436:55.71]Which I will definitely be trying to get one.
[436:59.38]Whether that's through another Amazon order or through another means.
[437:02.61]So, definitely.
[437:03.97]Thank you.
[437:05.31]Dorkcube, thanks for the $1.
[437:06.71]What a plot twist that you would end up interacting with Joel more than Vinny.
[437:12.61]I interact with Vinny.
[437:18.87]They're both fucking cool.
[437:20.49]What are you talking about?
[437:31.66]Why do you... What do you mean neglect?
[437:39.22]I don't have... I don't have any... I just... It's organic.
[437:46.29]Organic.
[437:48.33]Do you hang out with somebody?
[437:49.75]You don't hang out with somebody?
[437:50.69]Like, for instance, Kryken was in Vegas.
[437:52.55]You know, when was the last time somebody streamed with Kryken?
[437:58.58]You hit me up.
[437:59.12]Hey, I'm in Vegas.
[438:00.56]Yeah, I'll, like, come say hello.
[438:01.82]Yeah, organic!
[438:05.16]There you... We did, and it was great.
[438:14.51]But... Thank you, Dorkube.
[438:16.97]Uh, thank you, Gibb, for the five dollars.
[438:18.83]Maggie Simpson, binky sound when you swim.
[438:22.25]Uh...
[438:27.26]Thank you, the cows are watching me for the 10 bucks.
[438:30.25]Hey Jerma, just want to tell you thanks for all the great laughs through the years.
[438:32.97]Hope you have an awesome 2019.
[438:34.35]By the way, love the Kenshi streams.
[438:36.17]Thanks.
[438:40.66]Thank you for supporting any of the content that I put out here.
[438:45.78]Any of the video games that I play, any of the stuff that I do.
[438:48.34]Thank you, it means a lot.
[438:51.28]I just hope that you're having fun.
[438:54.01]One of the reasons why...
[438:56.44]I purchase stuff like Dreamcast and buy a bunch of random games and just see what looks like could be fun or interesting.
[439:02.99]It's because that's why I want to do it.
[439:05.69]I want it to be an interesting experience for all of us.
[439:08.92]And it is, I think, a lot sometimes.
[439:11.08]I know that was just Noxiemoron, but... Arm level two is going to be in the next Jerma Rumble, and it's going to be a tiny, small person with just one jacked arm.
[439:29.79]I mean, that kind of has to happen.
[439:37.33]But thank you so much for the $10.
[439:38.09]Hey, LMM, thanks for the $3.
[439:43.71]No message, but thank you.
[439:44.69]Also, I want to say this one more time.
[439:48.43]I'm going to kind of transition it over the next couple of weeks.
[439:52.29]I'm changing the minimum bits for readings.
[439:55.83]But I didn't really want to just throw that and be like, okay, it's $3 now.
[440:00.68]So over the next couple of weeks, and then I'm going to kind of give like a cutoff.
[440:06.54]We talked about it a couple days ago.
[440:09.33]Just about streamlining things and it was a very long conversation about money.
[440:19.51]So it is turning into three.
[440:22.35]300 bits will be the minimum for reading at the end of a stream.
[440:29.52]And I don't think... It is not $3 now.
[440:33.50]I'm going to just... I just want to make people aware that in a few weeks, somewhere probably in February, that I'm going to keep talking about it.
[440:41.69]I'm going to make sure people are aware.
[440:42.75]Because I think last time, a lot of people weren't aware of it.
[440:48.54]And I kind of just made it a dollar like a year and a half ago.
[440:52.69]And then people were still spending, you know, 25 cents or 50 cents.
[440:56.25]And they were writing these very nice thought out messages.
[441:00.13]And I just wasn't, I don't think they even knew.
[441:02.75]So I'm not just going to do it immediately like I did kind of last time.
[441:11.77]But I have to do another explanation for it.
[441:16.57]We've seen such extreme growth on this channel with viewership and money and support.
[441:24.91]It's kind of... It's kind of a necessary evil at this point.
[441:34.55]Even just in viewership alone, it's gone up about nearly 35% or so in people that are just here.
[441:40.73]I hope you guys understand I'm not trying to
[441:46.96]Just bleed money out of people.
[441:52.59]I'm just trying to have... I'm just trying to, like, run... The best stream that I can.
[441:58.37]I hope you understand.
[441:59.03]And... We'll... Maybe... We'll see.
[442:11.80]We'll see how it goes.
[442:14.78]another year or two couple I mean I had the last uh minimum for about a year and a half right maybe a little bit more like just over a year maybe I don't really see there's an opportunity why it would be increased again anytime soon at all and maybe never again
[442:41.35]But that will be happening in the next few weeks.
[442:44.27]Just want to make people aware of it.
[442:46.95]But thank you, LMM, for the three bucks.
[442:48.85]Thank you, Dwarcube, for the one dollar.
[442:50.39]Those poor developers.
[442:52.01]They put all their time and effort into creating a new IP, only for it to die on the operating table.
[442:56.81]But you, Jerma, you can continue on their legacy.
[443:00.85]That's right.
[443:01.39]Floygen Brothers for Jerma Rumble.
[443:12.07]We... You know, there was some talk that we've got potentially like a C- stream here.
[443:20.69]But interestingly enough, even in like a C- stream, there are probably five new characters that I can put into a wrestling event.
[443:32.46]That's pretty great.
[443:36.96]Floygan Brothers tag team match.
[443:40.73]That messed up alien that I made.
[443:45.42]Level 2 arm.
[443:46.86]There are a lot.
[443:52.82]Well, they're all C-minus characters.
[443:58.48]Nah, but I kid.
[443:59.74]Kidding around.
[444:04.63]I missed the stream, so it gets an F. No, I had fun.
[444:13.43]There was one or two places where I didn't.
[444:17.87]But not really.
[444:19.13]Out of a seven plus hour stream, I think I had fun for about six hours and 42 minutes.
[444:33.18]Fucking... I wish I had like an exact screenshot of when that happened.
[444:39.61]I think I remember who it was.
[444:41.01]Exactly.
[444:42.33]It was Penny.
[444:43.67]It was Penny Kettle.
[444:48.91]It was just perfect.
[444:51.89]It came at a perfect time.
[444:53.09]Yeah, that came at a perfect time.
[445:00.73]It was unbelievably timed.
[445:04.83]Like, that's a bravo.
[445:10.58]But thank you, Dorkube.
[445:11.42]Thank you, Smelly Boy, for the $1.
[445:12.76]The Floygan Brothers better be in the next Rumble.
[445:14.46]They will be.
[445:16.48]Hyena Dip, thanks for the $1.
[445:17.70]This is just of Mice and Men, the game.
[445:22.36]Casey, thanks for the $1.
[445:24.05]The voices of the Floygan Brothers are the voices of Scooby and Max from a Goofy movie.
[445:29.45]This game even actually had legitimate DLC.
[445:36.74]Yeah, I can't, I... Even when we were playing it, sure, it's a little slow.
[445:40.94]Maybe a little too... potentially boring for a stream, maybe, but as a video game for a... kind of... young audience, that was probably great back when it came out.
[445:51.33]It just, it was.
[445:52.47]Had to have been.
[445:56.39]Thank you, Marvish McGally, for the $1 watching.
[445:58.15]You beat Dynamite Cop with just four credits.
[445:59.89]Was very much worth it.
[446:00.83]It's a great game.
[446:07.01]Thank you, Freudian Weapon, for the $2.
[446:08.25]Definitely going to track down a copy of Dynamite Cop for my Dreamcast.
[446:12.28]The game looks bonkers.
[446:15.44]Yeah, it is more than one player.
[446:17.30]It is, I believe, two players at least.
[446:27.65]Oh, did Penny got gifted a sub?
[446:32.47]Well, thank you for whoever did that.
[446:39.73]I missed it.
[446:40.25]What did Penny Kettle do?
[446:43.26]No, nothing bad.
[446:44.12]It was just very, very funny to me.
[446:48.60]I was running up and down a slope in a game, and I can't even explain it.
[446:56.60]It just was perfect.
[446:59.26]I can't.
[447:02.85]WildFox, thanks for the $1.
[447:04.11]Hey Jerma, something you said recently made me remember a saying that I came up with some years ago.
[447:08.95]Political differences destroy friendships, but complete political indifference destroys lives.
[447:14.14]Refusing to talk about politics is a good decision, especially on stream.
[447:17.98]On a side note, sorry I haven't brought up depression a few times with the few donations I made, but it's very relieving to vent about it in a way.
[447:28.53]No, that's okay.
[447:29.67]Don't worry about that.
[447:33.13]But yeah, politics and... We touched upon it.
[447:37.81]We talked about it already a few nights ago.
[447:42.98]But I don't want to turn this stream into a debate.
[447:46.38]Because that's not what it is intended for.
[447:51.07]My intention to broadcast and hang out here and do stuff and hang out with you guys in like this live kind of broadcasted community thing is not to start debates.
[448:04.74]That's not why I'm here.
[448:11.80]We're here just to hang out and have a good time.
[448:15.02]That's it.
[448:23.53]But I really appreciate it.
[448:25.41]Thank you so much for the $1, WildFox.
[448:29.11]Lazy Luke, thanks for the $1.
[448:32.45]We got a top 1,000 streamer.
[448:37.64]A piece of work here.
[448:42.12]Did I go up any higher?
[448:43.92]I was top 800 a few weeks ago.
[448:46.60]Did I fall back down to Earth?
[448:48.76]What happened?
[448:49.74]Am I back down to the top 1,000?
[449:03.85]Then you played the Dreamcast and went back down.
[449:15.58]It's a great system with some genre-defining moments.
[449:20.54]Coca-Cola Classic.
[449:23.54]But thank you to Jules for the $1.
[449:25.52]I never heard of Dynamite Cop, but Die Hard Arcade was also my favorite arcade game.
[449:29.97]It's the only arcade game I ever beat in an actual arcade.
[449:32.93]When I was like 12, my brother and I spent hours in one sitting playing this game.
[449:39.47]I don't know how many quarters we spent playing this, but it was so much fun.
[449:43.22]After we beat the game, I was surprised to see a crowd of about 30 spectators behind us.
[449:47.74]Glad to hear that this was one of your favorite arcade games too.
[449:49.94]It is so fun.
[449:57.21]Are we getting coxed here?
[449:59.05]Just a little?
[450:07.13]It's the laughing my ass off part that I think did it to me.
[450:20.11]But that's awesome, Jules.
[450:21.47]Thank you for the $1.
[450:23.35]Thank you, Snoozencopter, for the $1.
[450:24.69]Alright, Jeremiah, how can you enjoy Dynamite Cop this much and not even play 20 minutes of God Hand?
[450:28.89]Don't answer, I know.
[450:30.32]It takes time to get used to the controls in God Hand, and at least one or two hours.
[450:34.56]Please play it again, you'll love it.
[450:41.71]Yeah, I did kind of just give up on God Hand, didn't I?
[450:43.99]I don't know why.
[450:53.04]Everybody threw their hats in the air and cheered.
[451:03.45]I think one of the things with these compilation retro kind of streams is because there are so many, it's hard to put more than an hour or two into one of these.
[451:21.54]And some of them obviously don't... I mean, there's a lot of them.
[451:23.96]Most of them don't really necessarily even deserve an hour or two.
[451:30.28]But the ones that do, in the back of my mind, I'm always thinking... Oh, I've been here for like two and a half hours, but I've got a stack this high next to me of other games to play.
[451:45.45]But stuff like God Hand requires that time.
[451:50.67]Especially during like a compilation night Maybe it wouldn't be a bad.
[451:54.65]I mean I still get the thing over there I just did this still like six at least seven maybe eight PlayStation 2 games that are still over there All in due time all things will happen hopefully So many games and so little time during the day
[452:18.43]Yeah, I was thinking about going a little longer tonight, but I really need to eat something.
[452:22.97]I gotta go take, like, a proper break and eat.
[452:34.30]But we are, let's see...
[452:37.77]thank you sneezing copter thank you uh thank you jess for the one dollar you remember jamsters what is a jamster
[453:05.69]Holy shit.
[453:06.65]Yeah, I remember this.
[453:13.14]I forgot about that.
[453:15.76]The original scam.
[453:18.60]The original phone scam.
[453:32.13]I buried that, and you brought it back.
[453:33.95]I forgot all about those commercials.
[453:35.95]But thank you.
[453:37.31]Yeah, Crazy Frog was one of them.
[453:38.65]Remember he was in the go-kart in some city at night?
[453:47.25]It was a weird, like, Batmobile thing.
[453:48.64]Yeah, it was fucked up.
[453:53.46]Thank you, Carrot7, for the $1.
[453:54.86]Two games in, I have determined that Dreamcast games are the most chaotic, neutral items in existence.
[454:01.06]Kinda, yeah.
[454:03.41]Thank you, Alec, for the $1.
[454:04.75]You should play Bounty Hunter for the PS2.
[454:10.79]Bounty Hunter, Star Wars, I think you're talking about.
[454:14.87]I do remember it being a very fun game.
[454:17.33]Thank you, It's Time for Slime for the $1, and it's a link.
[454:22.49]Why would you give this to me right now?
[454:23.85]I didn't even find that.
[454:26.93]So the best part about this, the name, this was uploaded in 2014.
[454:31.27]This is called The Ring Terror's Realm.
[454:33.67]You ready?
[454:35.95]Are we still live?
[454:41.38]This YouTube video is called The Ring Terror's Realm.
[454:46.42]Most annoying music looped and extended.
[454:54.23]So you guys weren't... It wasn't just you guys.
[455:05.54]That's enough of that.
[455:11.39]Yeah, we're getting some... I don't know what's going on with the internet recently.
[455:15.13]I mean, we had a good solid probably five straight hours of no... Did we actually turn off?
[455:23.26]I don't know.
[455:26.56]We're getting kind of killed right now.
[455:34.87]We're still alive.
[455:36.93]We're not going to zero, which is a good thing, but... The first hour or so of the stream was very chunky.
[455:46.05]It looks like the last 40 minutes or so here have been also pretty chunky.
[455:49.81]The middle of about five or six hours was fine.
[455:53.56]I'm not going to make a call.
[455:56.56]I'm going to have to make another phone call.
[456:01.58]But we're good.
[456:02.62]Thank you, It's Time for Slime, for the annoying music.
[456:06.35]Thank you, Divus, for the $2.
[456:07.41]Appreciate it.
[456:08.99]SomeGuy9, thanks for $5.
[456:10.59]Since people seem to like my ARF video from last stream, I'm back with another shitty meme video.
[456:29.21]What the hell was that?
[456:43.48]What was... That's a classic?
[456:46.16]I don't know any of these meme videos.
[456:49.63]Thank you SomeGuy9 for the five dollars.
[456:52.74]Thank you, Carrot, for the $1.
[456:54.40]I can't tell if I'm watching The Ring or The Room.
[456:57.89]This game is a beautiful disaster.
[457:00.73]Yeah, I just wish the game wasn't awful.
[457:03.71]If we got to power through that and see more of those cutscenes, the game just sucked.
[457:09.29]It was just sloppy, bad Resident Evil in between some great cutscenes.
[457:13.70]And the whole cast of Family Guy.
[457:22.96]It's just too bad that the game was unbearable.
[457:31.57]There are some great ones.
[457:41.58]Thank you Superman for the one dollar.
[457:43.20]Hey Jerma, noticed you're wearing a UNH t-shirt.
[457:45.80]Just wanted to know if you've ever visited New Hampshire because I grew up there and had some of the best experiences of my life there.
[457:51.14]Since I moved to California, I've hated it and miss seeing the snow every winter.
[457:56.21]That's not my shirt.
[457:58.77]But yeah, I've been to New Hampshire plenty of times.
[458:00.55]New Hampshire is a great state.
[458:06.29]There's a lot of awesome, especially the mountains.
[458:10.28]My family and I sometimes will go up and rent a house and stay there for a little while.
[458:17.94]Not so much anymore because I'm obviously across the country.
[458:22.98]It was very easy just to be like, alright, that's what we're gonna do next weekend.
[458:26.04]We're gonna go for two days.
[458:29.37]It's barely like a two-hour drive to get to New Hampshire.
[458:37.54]Speaking of snow, yeah, didn't, um... Didn't New England get kind of just crushed with a bad storm recently?
[458:47.13]So what was up with the naked thing at the start of the stream?
[458:49.07]Was that just a weird joke?
[458:52.10]Um... A weird joke.
[458:55.66]The camera captures it in one frame and it keeps it there in the naked thing.
[459:06.95]New England's about to get crushed by the Rams.
[459:09.88]I don't think so.
[459:10.64]I don't think so.
[459:11.20]I don't think so.
[459:13.80]Is the audio getting weird for people?
[459:16.48]I keep seeing people say that.
[459:17.88]Yeah, I thought it was like a funny thing to do.
[459:22.91]Is just have no shirt on and like be unshowered.
[459:28.01]Like I got my hair was just all messy and like greasy and I like didn't have any clothes.
[459:31.69]I thought it'd be like a funny joke.
[459:43.56]The music is just cursed.
[459:50.68]But yeah, I love New Hampshire.
[459:52.44]It's a great state.
[459:54.79]Thank you, Casey, for the $5.
[459:55.93]Thank you for playing my favorite console.
[459:57.17]There are still people playing Dreamcast online, if you can believe it.
[460:01.79]Really.
[460:06.83]Really hyped for the Tony Hawk stream tomorrow.
[460:08.41]I grew up on that game.
[460:09.21]It's one of my favorites.
[460:09.85]Tony Hawk 2 is also the best one in the whole franchise.
[460:15.50]It just is.
[460:19.80]I am looking forward to it.
[460:21.59]I am going to play the shit out of that game tomorrow.
[460:28.48]But thank you, Casey.
[460:29.86]I do very much enjoy the Dreamcast as well.
[460:32.53]It's a very, very interesting system.
[460:35.01]Especially because it's SEGA's last system.
[460:38.31]So, it's an interesting piece of hardware.
[460:44.97]Hey, Smellyboy, thanks for the $1.
[460:46.23]You better be ready for that one bare shoulder frame to be in every piece of fan-made content for the next two years.
[460:51.49]That's okay.
[460:52.69]It was a funny fucking joke that I did.
[460:55.37]It was a joke.
[460:56.65]You think I was like, you think I actually would do that?
[460:58.41]I make all the references about how I don't have clothes on ever?
[461:01.59]Come on.
[461:03.69]Like, I... I... Kappa.
[461:13.26]Thank you, Hasnain, for the $1.
[461:14.76]I lost $100 because you didn't die on Wednesday.
[461:17.00]Thanks a lot.
[461:18.64]Why would you ever take that bet?
[461:24.17]That's a very bad bet to make.
[461:25.69]Hey Trotter, thanks for the $1.
[461:29.11]So Jerma, what are you doing with the camera on when you were naked?
[461:34.17]Setting up the stream.
[461:37.34]That photo was taken at probably... That frame was captured at probably... Like... 2... 45?
[461:43.18]250?
[461:43.86]Pacific?
[461:48.91]and I came back after showering and getting ready and setting the stream up and it was setting up the live stream you had the door open so you just walk around naked I wasn't naked I was not naked I thought just walk around with just nudity I don't that's not what happens
[462:18.06]Thank you Smellyboy for the $1.
[462:19.54]I saw your nude shoulder.
[462:21.14]I'm sure you did, you did.
[462:23.70]Thank you C4G for the $4.20 weed joke.
[462:27.50]Will Jerma read this?
[462:28.56]I just did.
[462:30.68]Thank you for the $4.20, C4G.
[462:33.92]Thank you Sam K42 for the $1.
[462:36.82]A little tip for the stream.
[462:37.98]Love you, Jeremy.
[462:39.82]Thank you.
[462:41.58]And then Timmy Tim Tam, thanks for the $1.
[462:43.22]Wow, I'm really tired.
[462:48.38]Always a pleasure to hear these.
[462:51.50]I'm really tired and now I have to go home and cook.
[462:54.55]Do you make dinner every night?
[462:56.03]Yes, I usually make dinner and my husband washes the dishes.
[462:59.71]I live alone so I do everything.
[463:01.43]Sometimes I eat out though.
[463:02.77]There are some good restaurants in my neighborhood.
[463:04.63]Where do you live?
[463:05.65]Near the Penn Center.
[463:06.63]Oh, that's good.
[463:07.57]There aren't any good restaurants near my house.
[463:09.71]Does your husband help you do housework much?
[463:12.00]Um, yes.
[463:13.36]He sets the table almost every night, and he makes our bed every morning, but I usually make all the meals.
[463:18.46]How about cleaning?
[463:19.60]We clean the house together every weekend.
[463:21.82]I vacuum the rooms, and he usually sweeps the floor of the kitchen, and he does yard work.
[463:26.21]Your husband helps you so much.
[463:28.75]Both these ladies are on coke.
[463:32.37]Or, like, crack.
[463:35.39]This is like, there are drugs involved here.
[463:38.79]They have- There are.
[463:39.55]He's talking like so fast and with such a strange rhythm.
[463:42.39]Small talk.
[463:42.73]Oy.
[463:42.85]Okay.
[464:02.62]Thank you for that.
[464:03.48]And we had a few more come in as we were going over the other ones there.
[464:07.54]Thank you, RTM, for the $1.
[464:08.86]Hey, Jerma, I was listening to the stream while playing Remake 2.
[464:11.04]Just wondering if you were going to take a look at it on stream.
[464:13.67]If not, definitely check it out on your own time.
[464:15.03]It's an absolutely gorgeous game.
[464:16.25]I'm going to be playing Resident Evil 2 on stream in a few days.
[464:24.47]That's going to be the start of the next week.
[464:26.74]I'm going to try to just complete it.
[464:29.30]How long is the game?
[464:41.59]Kim, you don't do any of those things.
[464:44.05]And then the laughing my ass off face.
[464:53.98]Any of what things?
[465:07.92]hold on hold on hold on a second wait wait wait wait wait let's let's just go over a couple things here um it's pulling weeds what about the pulling the weeds that's housework what about scrubbing the steps is that not housework took about an hour or two to me to do that pulling weeds out
[465:41.53]That's the yard work.
[465:42.59]Well, I do the yard work, and Kim does the housework, and then I do the dishes, and then sometimes she sets the table.
[465:50.41]I can relate to this.
[465:51.27]Come on.
[465:55.06]That's not the right video.
[465:56.04]That's a different YouTube link.
[466:03.68]Two hours to clean.
[466:04.56]You don't have any idea.
[466:09.98]You know how many times I've vacuumed?
[466:16.63]My hands are raw with the amount of just yard work that I've done.
[466:23.40]Breaking up rocks, pulling out shit, testing, you know, tapping, tap, tap, tap, licking fingers, like, is that good?
[466:32.27]Is that clean?
[466:40.05]Oh, she's just having fun.
[466:41.09]Okay.
[466:48.69]Food's in the oven?
[466:51.04]Food is in the oven.
[466:51.74]Oh, okay.
[466:52.54]Well, thank you.
[466:53.76]I'm sure it's delicious because you made it.
[466:56.60]And I know it's going to be absolutely scrumptious.
[467:10.06]Kim isn't modern or subbed.
[467:13.22]Was that even the right Kim?
[467:17.89]It's better than my rotten cooking?
[467:19.65]You've never had the most succulent salmon of your life unless you've had it by me.
[467:24.49]Okay?
[467:26.31]I do a butter au jus on top.
[467:29.75]It goes in the pan.
[467:30.57]I tip.
[467:31.51]I put the oil and the butter and the cheese.
[467:36.07]I tip it.
[467:36.89]I do the Gordon Ramsay.
[467:37.97]Scoop, slap, scoop, splash, scoop, slap, scoop, splash.
[467:40.82]Oh, the oil gets all over it.
[467:42.16]You baste it.
[467:44.10]Into the oven.
[467:44.62]420 degrees.
[467:47.34]It comes out, you can smell the whole house smells like it.
[467:49.66]The whole house stinks like fish.
[467:51.62]Like, delicious salmon fish, and it's wonderful you've never had anything more tasty in your whole life.
[467:58.19]I sprinkle a little bit of rosemary just because I fucking can.
[468:11.27]And then I do a little bit of a drizzle with EVOO.
[468:16.37]Oh, extra virgin olive oil.
[468:19.19]And it's lemon infused.
[468:21.65]Not your typical shit that you get on the grocery.
[468:23.87]No, they get a special order, the lemon infused one.
[468:27.64]Talk more about my cooking, how it's not very good.
[468:47.61]It sounds awful.
[468:49.21]What?
[468:52.70]If you wanted me to, I would do a cooking salmon infused lemon tang stream.
[469:00.38]And I would show you all.
[469:08.29]The whole house is going to stink, and it's going to be great.
[469:11.52]But anyways.
[469:14.62]How do we get there?
[469:15.20]Yeah, I'm going to play Resident Evil 2 probably on Monday.
[469:18.44]Hey, Mr. Kool-Aid, thanks for the $1.
[469:19.72]Since we're on the subject of Dreamcast, I very much recommend Skies of Arcadia.
[469:23.30]The world is vibrant, the music is fantastic, and it's a genuinely fun RPG.
[469:28.00]They did remaster it for GameCube, but back in the day, it was the best reason for ever owning a Dreamcast.
[469:33.54]If you decide to play it, it's quite the classic.
[469:37.51]Another one, uh, Dreamcast.
[469:39.61]Did have some of the best RPGs for its time.
[469:44.29]Now, long-winded 50-hour to 100-hour classic RPGs on the Dreamcast, I'm not sure they'd be... I don't think I'd want to stream them, but I do appreciate that they exist.
[470:01.31]What kind of pan do you use?
[470:02.35]My hand.
[470:03.45]I hold it in my hand and I put my hand over the burner.
[470:06.71]It does a pretty good job.
[470:20.04]No, you can do it in cast iron, you can do it in a non-stick skillet, you can do it in a pan in the oven.
[470:25.50]Actually, in the oven, it's... I actually prefer it in the oven.
[470:30.25]because it can get, it cooks all around and you take it out, it's got the medium rare texture inside.
[470:34.67]Nice medium, barely opaque, flaking salmon buttery fish.
[470:44.43]I would put my salmon up against any five-star restaurant salmon and win.
[470:59.37]I don't care who it was.
[471:04.61]Jerma is an insecure masochist who made up a salmon recipe to impress a bunch of... What?
[471:14.14]What are you talking about, man?
[471:16.06]Lifting shirt from neck, grabbing and pulling.
[471:20.76]What are you talking about, man?
[471:24.74]I'm really good at doing that.
[471:30.97]Hey, thank you, Barry, for the $1.
[471:35.79]Jerma, it's okay.
[471:36.41]We understand.
[471:36.93]Also, please have a meet-up in Vegas.
[471:38.35]I go to college there.
[471:42.06]A casino meet-up?
[471:45.04]A casino meet-up where everybody gives a dollar and we put a dollar on every single symbol at the roulette table?
[471:52.65]No, we make it so everyone goes in and we have, everybody gives a dollar and we just put like a hundred bucks on every single number.
[472:03.30]From double zero all the way to 35.
[472:06.68]And then whatever hits, we just, you know, something's going to hit.
[472:10.38]But they don't, you know, that's 3,500 bucks goes to charity.
[472:21.82]But that would mean that they would have to be way more... It would be like... We'd just be losing like three or four or five thousand dollars.
[472:28.63]Why wouldn't we just give ten grand to charity?
[472:36.80]That doesn't make any sense.
[472:42.28]But... I don't know.
[472:43.44]I don't... I don't...
[472:46.80]I don't know.
[472:47.58]I don't really do meetups.
[472:49.64]Unless they're at, like, a convention or a place where I know I want to be, or... I'm fucking... I'm a weirdo, guys.
[472:58.34]I'm... I don't... I don't know.
[473:02.90]Those of you that have met me in real life, you probably can attest to the fact that, like, he was a fucking strange person.
[473:09.23]You know, he went like this, that, this, and I scanned every item individually.
[473:12.37]I mean, that really happened.
[473:14.23]And it was embarrassing.
[473:33.23]I bet there's at least a couple of casinos that would be happy to host a charity roulette game.
[473:37.73]Just to have the exposure and more people in the establishment playing other games.
[473:41.73]You'd be surprised though, a lot of those places are very, very heavily regulated.
[473:46.53]And have very, very, very strict rules on what is allowed and not allowed.
[473:52.68]That would be a tough cookie to sell, I think.
[473:59.78]Because then, they're very, very particular.
[474:06.35]Buy your own casino.
[474:08.91]You know, I had this weird dream.
[474:11.69]And for some stupid, dumb reason, I looked up, like, leasing prices in Vegas.
[474:16.06]I had this weird dream about this, like, video game restaurant.
[474:21.02]And I just... I was like, oh, that's kind of cool.
[474:22.58]Like, on the Strip.
[474:23.48]That would be kind of... Look, on the Strip of Vegas, like, a video game with, like, arcades.
[474:27.18]Like, and, like, a cool menu.
[474:29.94]And, like, it serves alcohol, but it's not Dave & Buster's.
[474:33.30]But it's, like, way... It would be, like, a better version of Dave & Buster's.
[474:38.21]And it was like three or four, I think it was like $300,000 a year to lease like a place on the strip.
[474:48.25]It'd be like Dave and Buster's, but there's no prize games.
[474:52.75]It's more of a bar restaurant that has like three or four pinball machines.
[474:57.45]So it's not like Dave and Buster's at all.
[474:59.43]It would be a bar restaurant that has three or four pinball machines.
[475:03.26]And a video game themed menu.
[475:05.68]This is a bad idea.
[475:07.60]And I hope they deny me the loan.
[475:18.51]Hey Tingy, thanks for the two bucks.
[475:19.65]What's this about you being naked?
[475:20.71]Did I miss something while I was at work?
[475:21.85]You didn't?
[475:22.13]No.
[475:23.37]You didn't miss anything.
[475:25.54]And what you did miss, potentially, was I was done on purpose.
[475:28.44]Because it was funny.
[475:30.54]You know?
[475:32.24]Hey, thank you Kinky for the $1.
[475:34.42]Snap your discs for more.
[475:36.90]No.
[475:38.22]Not snapping any discs.
[475:39.04]Thank you Senator Choochie for the $1.
[475:41.40]Clueless Sniper for the $1.
[475:43.97]Thank you to Jug for the $3.
[475:46.59]I would be down for an ARMS level 2 emote.
[475:52.94]God.
[475:54.62]Special thanks for the $1.
[475:56.18]Hey Jeremy, have you seen the Garfield game for PS2 and PC?
[475:58.58]It looks awful.
[475:59.72]It's not Garfield Kart.
[476:02.02]And they link a speedrun.
[476:03.22]I don't want to look at it because if it's something I want to try, then I want to go in blind.
[476:07.41]Thanks for the laughs from Australia.
[476:08.79]It is Australia Day.
[476:11.11]Happy Australia Day.
[476:13.64]Also, please do the cooking stream, perhaps invite the egg.
[476:16.01]Everybody loves the egg.
[476:19.93]But, thank you.
[476:21.03]Uh, if it's on PS2 or PC, maybe I'll... But that would just push more Garfield.
[476:25.61]I'm not sure if I want to do that.
[476:27.61]Maybe.
[476:29.31]Hey, Dr. Steen, $1!
[476:30.27]Do a Choose Your Own Adventure cooking stream where you have a shitload of ingredients, and if chat, choose which ones to use and when using the click feature.
[476:40.19]You are asking for me to burn down my kitchen.
[476:46.91]Bad idea, though.
[476:50.47]Choose your own adventure stream.
[476:53.62]Shh, don't talk about that.
[476:56.14]Something that might happen soon.
[476:57.68]And by soon, I mean, like, it's currently... The cogs are turning with a few people.
[477:05.67]It's not going to be, like, a huge thing.
[477:07.63]It's going to be fairly simple.
[477:08.71]But it's going to be fun.
[477:13.52]We'll see.
[477:14.86]There's all kinds of ideas flying around in my salmon brain.
[477:17.56]Yeah, sure.
[477:19.18]It's super cool.
[477:19.62]If I ever feel like doing a meetup, yeah, I'll pick somewhere cool and interesting.
[477:44.46]Well, let's get the credits on the screen.
[477:45.54]That's all the bits.
[477:46.08]Thank you, everybody, for your monetary bits, support, and also to everybody that subbed and resubbed today.
[477:53.03]And all the gifted subs.
[477:54.09]There were a lot of those, too.
[478:03.21]Thank you guys so much.
[478:03.95]I will see you all tomorrow.
[478:06.99]And let's raid Nova.
[478:11.19]That sounds like an interesting idea.
[478:14.61]Hopefully we don't click over on his channel and see the offline image.
[478:24.21]What emote do we use for Jerma raids?
[478:28.94]That's on you guys.
[478:29.74]Whatever you feel like doing.
[478:31.24]Alright, so how do I do this?
[478:37.49]Forgot how to do it again.
[478:42.70]Oh, here we go.
[478:43.24]I can pick a channel to raid.
[478:51.18]Okay.
[478:52.12]Hold on.
[478:52.91]Wait.
[478:53.07]Not yet.
[478:53.33]Not yet.
[478:54.29]So let me get this right.
[478:55.45]So I gotta... We do this.
[478:56.87]We say, here we go.
[478:58.73]And then I... I hit raid.
[479:00.93]We queue up for it.
[479:02.73]Then I turn off my stream.
[479:05.79]And then do send the raid.
[479:08.27]Right?
[479:11.52]That's what we do, right?
[479:15.66]Okay.
[479:19.12]But we're raiding- we're raiding Nova.
[479:22.04]We are raiding Nova.
[479:23.08]Clear, at least.
[479:23.66]I'll see you all to- whoa!
[479:26.72]That was his stream.
[479:28.70]I'll see you all tomorrow.
[479:30.30]Probably around the same time, around 3 o'clock Pacific.
[479:33.32]Tony Hawk 2.
[479:38.12]We don't know.
[479:38.90]Well, neither do I.
[479:45.96]See you very soon.
[479:48.54]Power Stone, Tony Hawk.
[479:50.78]And some other stuff.
[479:54.35]Give everybody a good night.
[479:56.77]Good night.
[480:00.67]By the way, Nova's playing Resident Evil 2.
[480:03.45]Not sure how far into the game they are.
[480:05.49]But that's what they're playing.
[480:06.47]If you're like, oh shit!
[480:07.73]I don't want to see the second boss.
[480:09.61]I have no idea.
[480:12.42]Go give some love.
[480:13.42]Go say hello.
[480:26.29]The game apparently is very good, right?
[480:30.59]From my understanding, it is very well made and very, very fun.
[480:41.84]Pretty good.
[480:42.36]Well, I will be the judge of that.
[480:46.52]Thank you, everybody, for your subscriptions.
[480:50.08]See you very soon tomorrow.
[480:52.92]Let's queue up the rips.
[480:57.17]Ready to raid.
[481:03.81]Who's going?
[481:11.27]Have a great night, guys.
[481:12.61]See you tomorrow.
