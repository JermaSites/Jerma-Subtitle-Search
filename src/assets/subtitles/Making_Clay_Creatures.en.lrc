[00:22.19]See you in a second.
[00:24.34]I'm in the room.
[00:26.34]I'm just, uh, the setup is kind of weird, so hold on.
[00:42.54]Here, look at some mountains for a minute.
[01:01.42]Bye.
[01:04.25]Okay, hold on.
[01:18.97]Hold on.
[01:38.70]hold on every second
[02:01.33]Look at that.
[02:02.87]Everyone said I'm bald.
[02:03.48]Nope.
[02:14.68]Okay, how's that?
[02:19.89]We're gonna test it.
[02:31.23]I gotta crawl under the table.
[02:33.02]I'll be right there.
[02:37.94]Ow.
[02:54.08]Hey, welcome to Messy McLean.
[02:57.17]Oh, shit.
[02:57.72]Am I not tall enough?
[02:59.20]Am I tall enough?
[03:01.99]It's got to be pulled more this way, more that way.
[03:06.75]Like that.
[03:07.90]That way.
[03:10.33]Alright, hold on.
[03:10.81]Give me one more second.
[03:14.90]Oh, look.
[03:19.55]Yeah.
[03:20.61]I can't touch anything.
[03:22.22]I've been playing Operation with my stuff.
[03:39.15]How's that?
[03:40.04]Better?
[03:42.97]Let's find out.
[03:47.32]Wow.
[03:48.69]Stop.
[03:52.55]Okay.
[03:57.01]Gotta go higher.
[04:04.45]Hey, welcome to the clay stream where I crawl into my furniture for an hour.
[04:16.99]That's got to be enough, right?
[04:18.46]It has to be.
[04:29.85]Alright, let's go.
[04:30.60]I'm ready.
[04:44.02]Hey!
[04:50.38]Hey!
[04:50.78]How are ya?
[04:51.96]Hello!
[04:54.47]Welcome, everybody.
[04:56.05]Finally.
[04:56.59]Yes, I know.
[04:58.34]Okay.
[04:59.51]So I don't want the mic to be that close.
[05:01.11]I feel like it's going to be crinkling and awful.
[05:03.98]But here we go.
[05:06.45]Here's what I got to work with tonight.
[05:08.84]Okay, let's make sure I got to go in that arts and crafts category.
[05:15.06]Please turn more lights on.
[05:17.53]This is, look, this is perfect lighting.
[05:21.20]Yes, I know I have wicked veiny fucking hands, okay?
[05:24.23]I'm looking over at the chat.
[05:25.44]I'm gonna get it out there before everybody starts to say it.
[05:27.89]I got veiny ass hands.
[05:30.87]I know.
[05:31.25]Whatever.
[05:32.60]Do you want me to wear gloves?
[05:33.63]I'll put on gloves for you.
[05:38.58]I'm 40, this is a 40 year old man's hands, okay?
[05:42.10]I got scrapes, I got cuts, it's dryness.
[05:46.22]Alright, here's what we got to work with.
[05:50.20]Sponge for dabbing.
[05:55.01]This is, this is model magic.
[05:57.94]It is this back is not this, this is about a year old.
[06:03.84]Does this go bad?
[06:07.05]If it's airtight in the thing, does it go bad?
[06:14.48]Uh, and then I got this shit too.
[06:16.58]Fluffy putty.
[06:19.23]It's gonna make whatever.
[06:20.84]We've got our assorted tools.
[06:22.95]As you can see here, these are the tools that we'll be using.
[06:25.98]I'm gonna work.
[06:26.72]here.
[06:27.51]Let's actually go right there.
[06:29.83]That's better.
[06:31.16]Here's my workstation like that.
[06:34.55]This stuff is good.
[06:35.44]This stuff never dries, by the way.
[06:40.48]It's been a long time since I've done this, I'm going to be honest.
[06:43.51]When I used to do this, I liked the stuff that you don't have to cook.
[06:47.96]I just wanted to play with.
[06:50.20]But yeah, I don't know shit about any of this.
[06:51.94]So if you're here, if you're coming here, this is a clay stream.
[06:54.61]He said, oh man, dude, I can't wait to see this guy that knows what he's doing.
[06:57.74]This is not, you're in the wrong place.
[06:59.87]Imagine that I am a seventh grader and the teacher brought in clay today.
[07:05.74]And bro, this is a big deal, right?
[07:07.95]This is a big deal to a seventh grader.
[07:10.22]Alright.
[07:11.67]Let's go with...
[07:15.00]I got my water here, because you might want to work with wet hands.
[07:20.67]And I'm going to make a monster.
[07:21.37]We're just going to see what happens.
[07:22.61]Just let the art just flow through you, okay?
[07:29.56]Which one do I want to use?
[07:32.59]Alright, do you want me to use the DOS or the Plastilina?
[07:37.79]Viewer's choice.
[07:43.45]Das.
[07:45.02]Okay.
[07:48.39]And I can do weird shit with that later.
[07:50.12]Let's go.
[07:50.50]Open it up.
[07:53.17]I believe this stuff also doesn't dry.
[07:54.94]It's pretty mushy.
[07:59.61]I live in Las Vegas too, so is it possible that the heat...
[08:03.20]fuck this all up eventually over the last six months?
[08:05.27]We'll find out.
[08:05.77]Dude, it looks like peanut butter fluff.
[08:08.73]Look at that.
[08:12.07]I'm going to cut the whole thing.
[08:13.92]Why not?
[08:14.26]Fuck it.
[08:18.44]Cut out the whole thing.
[08:20.90]You want to say it looks like it's like a block of marshmallow.
[08:23.83]Don't eat it though.
[08:28.96]Reveal.
[08:33.81]Alright, so I'm gonna make a monster.
[08:35.64]That's what I used to like to do.
[08:38.45]And I would just do it by just simply
[08:41.60]I would just kind of mush it together and see what happens.
[08:45.36]Give him teeth.
[08:46.12]We'll see.
[08:48.73]How are these ASMR sound effects?
[08:51.66]Alright, I should probably wet my hands.
[09:00.25]Let's get this out.
[09:02.68]Okay.
[09:04.83]I didn't think about trash for this.
[09:05.95]Hold on.
[09:09.63]Put it right there.
[09:10.09]Whatever.
[09:11.56]Okay, so I'm going to call this monster Rectangly.
[09:16.85]And here he is, and I'm done.
[09:18.98]Don't fuck it up.
[09:20.55]Alright, let me think.
[09:21.62]Let's make a large body.
[09:26.40]Hold on.
[09:30.37]This is the shit in Hitman where you're like...
[09:32.44]I don't even need to do this.
[09:35.16]I'm just doing it for fun.
[09:37.05]Ready?
[09:38.39]Bro, this is the first cut of the night.
[09:39.88]Are you serious?
[09:42.51]Aww.
[09:50.27]Did I just cut my hands doing that?
[09:52.14]Be careful with that.
[09:54.12]Look at that.
[09:54.95]Perfect brick.
[09:58.92]Here we go.
[09:59.58]Where's my roller?
[10:01.47]No, we're going to do this.
[10:02.38]Just get your hands wet.
[10:05.76]Let's start working.
[10:08.44]Workplace safety.
[10:15.49]Because you can take your anger out.
[10:19.85]Alright.
[10:20.13]And what I like to do is I'm not even kidding, by the way.
[10:23.01]It's just like, what does it start to look like?
[10:24.85]I don't even give a fuck.
[10:25.64]You know what I mean?
[10:26.38]What does it look like?
[10:27.81]What's that look like?
[10:28.27]Ice cream monster.
[10:28.81]Done.
[10:32.61]No, no, no.
[10:33.47]Here we go.
[10:33.85]Alright.
[10:34.12]I'm looking at.
[10:36.21]Okay.
[10:37.03]Wait, just get the shape.
[10:40.03]Looks like a turd.
[10:45.65]No.
[10:46.42]Wait.
[10:47.08]Actually, no.
[10:47.98]Hold on a second.
[10:51.83]I'm cooking here.
[10:52.41]Wait a minute.
[10:54.49]Let me get the shape and we'll get the tools in.
[10:57.33]I'm thinking this is the mouth.
[10:59.16]That's the mouth right here.
[11:00.80]This is the nose.
[11:02.05]Nose comes up, bends a little, two big nostrils.
[11:07.96]Alright, let's work with that.
[11:10.31]And then the body, this will be the body.
[11:13.68]I like it because the lip is kind of good too.
[11:15.13]Hold on a second.
[11:17.14]Okay, you call it whatever.
[11:22.62]That's a mouth.
[11:24.14]You don't see the vision?
[11:25.95]You don't understand fucking art.
[11:28.32]Sorry.
[11:32.56]Alright, let me get the shape.
[11:33.56]I'm going to put this down.
[11:34.38]Let's get the body.
[11:42.77]And I actually do want to... Actually, no, I'll just roll it.
[11:46.28]I'll roll it with my own hands.
[11:57.46]Kind of need more...
[11:58.88]I might use the Placelino.
[12:01.31]Because the body is going to be... Let's go ahead and really work it here.
[12:10.57]I like how it feels in your hands.
[12:12.05]It actually feels pretty great.
[12:13.60]It's like squishing this dog hair all over this.
[12:19.51]It's okay.
[12:23.46]This clay is notoriously hard to work with.
[12:25.74]Well, why did you all tell me to do that?
[12:35.51]I think it's fine.
[12:36.11]Do I want the body?
[12:40.75]The body needs to be a little thicker than this, though.
[12:42.28]Hold on.
[12:51.17]I'm just trying to work it in a little.
[12:55.20]You don't want stiff-ass clay.
[12:56.45]Okay.
[12:59.00]You got to work it, man.
[13:00.40]You got to really get your hands in there and just fucking squish it.
[13:04.80]Roll it, squish it, and then you can kind of do whatever you want with it.
[13:09.31]Use more water to soften it?
[13:10.70]Yeah.
[13:11.42]I think it's okay for now, though.
[13:14.12]It's not bad.
[13:18.39]Alright.
[13:18.89]Are we thinking circular body or are we thinking long body?
[13:23.41]I'm thinking a circular body.
[13:26.72]Today in adult daycare, we're wasting a bunch of art supplies.
[13:31.82]What do you mean wasting?
[13:32.50]What are you talking about?
[13:34.69]I love doing this shit.
[13:36.72]Wasting?
[13:37.43]You think I'm wasting these supplies?
[13:38.99]I'm using these supplies.
[13:47.06]Aren't you supposed to use the clay?
[13:48.98]Is making a clay monster wasting art supplies?
[13:58.47]Isn't that the whole point is for you to make something with it?
[14:04.66]Okay.
[14:10.30]Alright, now it should be good now.
[14:12.51]I actually might make this a little smaller.
[14:25.31]I don't want that to be his mouth.
[14:29.22]I want to smoothen this out a little bit more.
[14:34.53]I'll do detail work after, because I'm not cooking this, so.
[14:41.60]I think the head needs to be a little smaller.
[14:47.83]looks like a penis.
[14:48.88]Just it's not done.
[14:57.43]This might be a little too heavy.
[15:05.44]Oh, I like that.
[15:08.13]I like what's going on there.
[15:09.25]Let me wet it a little more.
[15:14.40]I like to see the mouth here.
[15:15.31]I like how it's starting to form a little.
[15:17.95]That's an eye.
[15:18.69]Hold on, let me get a nice little slip there.
[15:28.00]So right.
[15:31.48]Like that.
[15:35.90]Looks like Diablo two, what?
[15:45.50]actually I Don't know if I have enough to really do like a full body, but I think I'm kind of liking this give me a second I
[15:56.95]Here's why I like this.
[16:11.98]He doesn't even need a body.
[16:23.59]Looks like a croissant.
[16:29.49]Okay.
[16:30.62]I don't dislike this, but
[16:50.49]Kind of sad.
[16:51.18]Maybe I should make him happier.
[16:58.15]Why is he sad?
[16:58.95]I mean, he's not supposed to be sad, but he might be.
[17:06.05]Sometimes when I get to this stage, I just smush it.
[17:23.85]Give me, you know what, give me one of these.
[17:34.21]There's a little too much here.
[17:35.60]Just trying to... Actually, I kind of like the texture.
[17:47.85]poop tools.
[17:54.13]Kind of give him like a little bit of a some texture in his head.
[17:58.60]Let's go thicker with it though.
[18:05.51]I like it.
[18:06.82]I'm gonna do that on the whole thing.
[18:14.34]And really just fucking mess it up.
[18:15.91]Look, there's no right way to do this, okay?
[18:20.81]There's only wrong ways.
[18:23.69]And those are your ways, okay?
[18:25.69]So let anybody tell you differently.
[18:34.76]Kind of looks like fur.
[18:37.97]I actually kind of like that it's fur.
[18:41.29]Alright, let me get some support here.
[18:46.44]I'm going to fix these feet too.
[18:49.42]Feet should come out a little more.
[18:50.71]That's kind of his like back.
[18:55.63]Let's see if we can get him to stand up.
[19:01.92]New fursona.
[19:03.57]Kind of looks like Gonzo.
[19:11.28]This dude should be in the Jerma Rumble.
[19:13.60]If there ever is another one.
[19:15.43]Alright, I'm thinking for his, like, feet.
[19:18.36]Maybe just, like, three...
[19:20.20]Kind of like wide toes.
[19:22.59]Kind of like a dinosaur foot.
[19:23.92]You know what I'm saying?
[19:27.73]I feel like I can do that better with
[19:30.55]Something here.
[19:31.31]Oh, look at this thing.
[19:33.26]That's perfect for what I need.
[19:35.66]I'll do that later.
[19:36.90]Let me see if this is better.
[19:43.24]Yeah, that's way better.
[20:01.65]I need to give some lip definition eventually here too.
[20:07.02]Maybe I should open his mouth a little more.
[20:11.39]I feel like this should be shorter.
[20:13.47]Is that too long you think?
[20:23.05]It's kind of like beak.
[20:24.35]What if I did another?
[20:25.12]We'll see.
[20:28.88]I want to get this out of the way because it'll help me mess with the eye later.
[20:40.87]Dude, look at that guy's technique.
[20:42.88]It sucks.
[20:46.25]Can you see what I'm up to here?
[20:48.76]You see what I'm doing here?
[20:51.67]It kind of looks almost like a dinosaur.
[21:06.13]It looks like wood.
[21:07.31]It does look like wood.
[21:14.06]Alright, should nostrils be under here or like disgusting up here?
[21:20.31]What do you think?
[21:27.12]You think under the nose?
[21:30.35]Like just two big nostrils.
[21:31.96]Yeah.
[21:33.40]I like I was looking at his neck.
[21:35.71]Look at that neck texture.
[21:39.31]Actually, you know, now that I got it a little bit more dry.
[21:41.53]Let's go up with it a little.
[21:48.52]make his neck a little skinnier that
[22:01.04]bend of the nose.
[22:05.67]Okay.
[22:08.30]Hmm.
[22:14.14]He looks like he's in a little bit of pain.
[22:16.21]Is this a Muppet?
[22:18.26]We're just going wherever it goes.
[22:22.00]I'm that annoying art teacher that you probably had that was like, just, you know what?
[22:25.87]Just go.
[22:26.35]And you, you end up having this.
[22:30.94]Oh.
[22:32.63]And the art teacher takes a look at it.
[22:35.16]You just kind of bring it up.
[22:35.92]You're like, this is what I got.
[22:38.15]And the art teacher goes, the plight of the human heart
[22:43.33]No!
[22:55.06]I actually like him a lot.
[22:56.40]This side is no good, though.
[22:58.45]We've got to fix this shit.
[22:59.94]Alright.
[23:00.42]Let me get this side.
[23:01.62]Actually, you know what?
[23:02.46]Let's get the vision going.
[23:04.57]I want...
[23:06.28]I gotta...
[23:07.01]I gotta...
[23:08.76]Boy, I gotta fix this shit.
[23:10.26]Big time.
[23:15.04]This is first eye right there.
[23:16.31]Let's go like this.
[23:29.63]It's gonna take a few minutes.
[23:30.47]I'm just gonna smoothen this out a little more.
[23:39.34]Looks like a smiling friends character.
[23:41.07]It does kind of look like a smiling friends character.
[24:09.46]It's kind of starting to look like an old man in a second here.
[24:15.88]Okay.
[24:26.30]That nose has got to get fixed.
[24:45.52]You know, what if I...
[24:52.74]I wonder if I make the...
[24:54.02]If I do this...
[24:58.09]I wonder if I can make maybe should make the eyes bigger.
[25:01.17]Is it the sorting hat?
[25:03.29]No, not yet.
[25:05.83]It's an eagle from Angry Birds.
[25:09.28]And now we're leveling up.
[25:40.62]Eh!
[25:42.21]Eh!
[25:56.85]I didn't fucking think that through.
[25:58.56]Hold on, hold on.
[25:59.12]I gotta...
[25:59.46]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[26:01.12]His head is a little too heavy.
[26:03.05]I don't want to put his head down to fuck up what I did in his head.
[26:05.73]Actually, you know what?
[26:06.32]I'll do this.
[26:09.61]Let me just I can do that.
[26:10.83]I can fix the detail later.
[26:19.92]Thank you.
[26:44.10]Just get it in there.
[26:44.79]Just work it in.
[26:57.60]You ready?
[27:01.00]Just let the art go wherever it's going to go.
[27:12.10]Getting there.
[27:31.35]We have a body!
[27:38.94]I gotta get some support under here.
[27:48.68]He kind of looks happy from this angle.
[27:50.61]Let's do it from this angle for a minute.
[28:14.05]You have to put the wiring under the neck.
[28:16.25]That's alright, though.
[28:20.05]It should be alright after a little bit more support like this.
[28:26.26]I guess I could put like a stick in there.
[28:35.53]It's too wet.
[28:36.11]It'll dry up.
[28:38.86]Let's need to patch it up.
[28:40.31]Once it can stand kind of on its own with the support from the clay, it should be fine.
[28:50.55]Alright, give me this thing.
[29:07.40]Who's this Pokémon?
[29:08.63]We'll see.
[29:27.62]OK, that side's fine.
[29:29.74]At least it's connected.
[29:52.44]This is a brain, by the way.
[29:53.64]That's a brain.
[30:21.08]I saw something else.
[30:36.18]It wasn't working for me anymore.
[30:50.95]Alright, now give me just a minute because I'm going to go around and do this to everything.
[30:55.63]Can you see what it looks like now?
[30:58.34]It's kind of looks more like an elephant.
[31:02.32]I'm glad that it's just standing right now and it could be like a bust.
[31:05.56]This is going to be a bust.
[31:08.56]You know what?
[31:08.86]Let's go ahead and do this.
[31:17.73]Give me a few minutes.
[31:18.60]Just go get, go take your trash out or whatever.
[31:57.96]Okay, don't put clay in your mouth.
[31:59.60]I was about to go, you know what I mean?
[32:22.70]You know, I learned on the Bugleberry Halloween stream that...
[32:28.71]Clay is actually incredibly dangerous to consume.
[32:33.79]And if you remember in that stream, I was, well, Bugleberry, was eating spiders that were running across the table.
[32:43.83]My hands were covered in pottery clay and I was just, clay was just getting in my mouth and I was almost pretty much eating it.
[32:50.86]And I didn't know.
[32:51.62]And I learned after the fact that yeah, it's actually really bad for you.
[33:00.29]Okay.
[33:08.75]I just wonder what would make it look so rough over here.
[33:14.41]Give me the... We'll do detail later.
[34:19.44]Is it going to be a little better?
[34:30.70]that's better alright we're gonna smooth them out a little I actually I actually don't uh I actually prefer
[34:38.78]The kind of messy, it's clay look.
[34:43.78]With the cracks and the kind of breaking in the clay.
[34:45.99]I actually like that a lot.
[34:46.89]I think it looks cool.
[34:48.50]There's a lot of people that do that that are way 100 million times better than I ever will be.
[34:53.86]I like that look.
[35:00.78]go for it let me see okay what are you what are you one looks like a stomach
[35:11.11]Alright, I want to try.
[35:12.03]How did I get that done?
[35:14.99]Now I can kind of go through and fix the eye.
[35:16.92]Actually, the eyes look a little old and tired, don't they?
[35:21.05]I hope you just didn't hear that.
[35:21.99]That was gross.
[35:27.62]What if I made the eyes bigger?
[35:30.79]Kinda like a rhino.
[35:33.47]Dude.
[35:34.79]Hold that thought.
[35:36.04]Give me a second.
[36:07.41]I'm going for a move.
[36:08.84]I don't care.
[37:26.28]Probably haven't said anything in like 10 minutes.
[37:30.14]It's not a bust anymore.
[37:31.15]He's sitting in a chair and he's going to be leaning back.
[37:51.88]These are his little feet.
[37:57.08]See?
[37:58.28]These are gonna be his little feet.
[38:02.22]Stop.
[38:07.49]And this is going to make this like a chair underneath him.
[38:10.12]You'll see.
[38:10.76]You'll see.
[38:12.13]Let the master work.
[38:38.56]Please don't break.
[38:39.30]Please don't break.
[38:39.92]Please don't break.
[38:40.80]Hold on, I gotta make sure you can see this in case it breaks.
[38:42.43]Because that's like the clip moment, right?
[38:44.54]Like, oh my god, Jerma's clay monster broke!
[38:48.44]I'm just disabling all clips.
[38:56.78]Yeah!
[39:00.21]We're on to something.
[39:20.81]Maybe I should have the little arms coming out too.
[39:25.63]Let's get this right.
[39:29.35]The feet and the legs I can figure out later.
[39:33.26]That's for another moment.
[39:34.51]But let's just at least get them kind of in the right thought here.
[39:43.81]Oh, he's actually sitting on a rock or something.
[39:45.29]I don't know.
[39:45.58]We'll figure it out.
[39:55.69]Actually, maybe I'll get a little bit extra on the bottom.
[39:59.90]So he's actually sitting down.
[40:23.64]That leg needs work.
[40:24.86]Hold on.
[40:35.99]Yeah.
[40:44.54]What does it look like on your end?
[40:45.97]It looks fucking pretty.
[40:47.01]Actually, I like how it's turning out.
[40:50.18]I'll be honest.
[40:50.72]It's like a little rhino elephant guy.
[40:54.09]I don't know.
[40:57.07]That's the best part.
[40:57.97]The reason why I like to do this, again, I haven't done it in a long time, is clay is one of the only mediums where...
[41:07.00]You could just kind of go in and just not give a fuck.
[41:11.52]Just not even care.
[41:12.24]You just don't care at all.
[41:16.05]And like I said, I was just mushing shit together and we'll see what happens.
[41:18.72]I don't know.
[41:21.51]It might suck.
[41:22.08]Maybe it's cool.
[41:22.72]Maybe it's fun.
[41:23.24]And the best part is if you don't like it,
[41:25.75]I could smash his head in right now, but I'm not going to.
[41:30.77]This mouth needs more work, but I'm working on this body here.
[41:34.34]I like it.
[41:35.84]I like how it's kind of like a little guy.
[41:52.55]Okay, so then now I gotta go through here for a sec.
[41:58.61]I want that to be defined, you know what I mean?
[42:02.14]I'll define it a little bit later.
[42:03.52]Alright.
[42:03.80]So now it's kind of leaning back.
[42:06.52]It's comfy.
[42:07.98]I need to do some work on the head.
[42:15.64]Give me that texture tool.
[42:18.55]Let's see what happens if I start doing this.
[42:24.69]I like it.
[42:26.45]Might be hard to see on your end, but I like what it looks like here.
[42:40.19]Can you actually see what that looks like?
[42:49.33]I mean, I'm kind of in the way, but you know.
[42:56.58]A little bit?
[42:57.00]Here, let me get it closer so you can see it.
[43:03.34]See the texture I'm going for?
[43:11.27]Looks like a little mole rat.
[43:12.20]It looks like a little mole rat.
[43:13.17]Yeah, it looks like a little, like a vole or something.
[43:25.38]Alright, now the question is do I want it all the way up to his head?
[43:28.11]Probably.
[43:46.14]needs to be a little more wet back here.
[43:55.10]I'm going to take professional photos with this, by the way, and put it on.
[43:57.87]I don't know.
[44:00.68]See you on the next room.
[44:26.08]No, that's too much.
[44:38.97]Oh, I like how he looks over here.
[44:41.20]He looks... Oh!
[44:47.11]Dude, that looks kind of good from the other angle.
[44:49.68]What if I just take a picture from that side?
[45:00.22]Look at that, you see the eye?
[45:10.14]Looks pretty good from that angle.
[45:11.91]I want to open that eye up a little more.
[45:13.68]The mouth will do in a minute.
[45:16.75]He's going to be snoozing.
[45:19.29]snoozing on a rock like a little baby rhinoceros
[45:40.30]I actually can't even...
[45:41.44]I don't think I can fix that eye.
[45:42.59]I think the eye is...
[45:43.60]I need to leave it completely alone.
[45:45.77]Alright, give me this.
[45:54.03]Tiny arms?
[45:54.65]Oh yeah, the tiny arms are going to be like an otter.
[45:58.25]Let me get this right.
[46:09.00]I might add a little bit more back here.
[46:10.30]To make it so it's really kind of slouching against something.
[46:30.67]I don't want to go too heavy, though, because I don't want him to fall.
[46:38.60]Okay, so that's fine right there.
[46:44.44]With my tool go.
[46:46.85]This is, if you see what this is, it's kind of a weird brush.
[46:51.71]It's a metallic, it's a metallic brush.
[46:53.57]That's what it feels like.
[46:54.46]Is he in a beanbag chair?
[46:55.48]Oh, like a rock or something, maybe.
[46:59.20]he's sitting in like a rock or a chair we'll figure it out as it develops but I gotta make his arms independently
[47:09.95]Probably with...
[47:14.67]I could probably paint this.
[47:15.83]But should I do the goofy fluffy putty on his head somewhere?
[47:18.81]Like a...
[47:19.60]Like this, down his head.
[47:24.72]That'd be kind of cool.
[47:29.22]Make a hat for him?
[47:31.95]We'll see what we can do.
[47:38.84]really scuff it up a little bit with this because I want that texture in there
[48:05.05]His mouth is hidden.
[48:07.26]I'll make sure to give it a better angle.
[48:10.26]It actually might not show it up on camera, but it actually looks pretty.
[48:13.91]I don't want to do too much to it.
[48:15.26]You can see the mouth.
[48:17.51]So you can get an angle.
[48:18.25]You can see his mouth.
[48:19.08]It's kind of... See how it's like there?
[48:22.64]Right there?
[48:25.10]And his eyes are closed.
[48:26.42]See that eye?
[48:27.02]That eye is closed.
[48:29.88]So he's kind of resting.
[48:32.20]I'll define it a little better later.
[48:37.21]He's kind of like,
[48:43.49]It's starting to harden up a little bit here, which actually is good because that means I can work on the other stuff.
[48:47.52]Alright, you know what?
[48:48.12]Let me do the arms.
[48:50.61]And I think I'm like... Like this.
[48:53.53]And I just kind of... Man, if only I could just get a newspaper to sit on his stomach.
[49:13.51]Okay.
[49:15.24]Uh, arms.
[49:18.65]I need to wet this clay.
[49:25.93]It's a fascinating little creature.
[49:30.43]I'll tell you that it is
[49:33.52]don't know I don't really I'm not really I don't really do this so I'm not actively doing this all the time
[49:40.65]And I don't know, maybe those of you that make art or you do it in front of people potentially.
[49:47.39]Yeah, it kind of feels a little naked.
[49:49.07]You know what I'm saying?
[49:51.75]Like, oh shit, this looks like shit, doesn't it?
[49:55.44]I can imagine people that are very good at this having people...
[50:01.60]Watch them do it.
[50:04.22]Someone's like, can I fuck up?
[50:07.55]But I think that's the nature of just making anything like this.
[50:09.58]I think the point is if you're going into it like this is to fuck it up.
[50:14.21]Like, that's how I went into it.
[50:16.24]And it's my good coping mechanism for, hey, that looks like shit.
[50:20.31]It's like, well, I didn't care anyways.
[50:23.30]Yes, I did.
[50:24.89]Okay.
[50:28.76]Arm thickness.
[50:32.08]What is the... What are you thinking?
[50:35.24]I think that's too thick.
[50:36.80]I think half that size.
[50:44.18]They got to be little, little.
[50:51.25]I mean, I could roll this out a little better, but it's alright.
[51:06.51]smaller than that even I'd say probably half of that too and I'm thinking he's probably got like Three Fingers
[51:25.27]Maybe even smell it like this.
[51:30.29]Probably stubby though.
[51:32.70]That.
[51:38.94]Maybe a little longer?
[51:50.01]Right there.
[52:04.51]I don't know what tool.
[52:05.27]What do I want?
[52:06.72]I don't know.
[52:07.66]What do I want tool?
[52:10.05]The tool that the caveman used.
[52:40.31]This is going to be tricky, but I need to do this to his arm.
[52:48.99]I probably can make the fingers later.
[52:50.70]Or maybe no, maybe you shouldn't have fingers.
[52:57.64]I don't like that.
[52:58.85]Hold on.
[52:59.25]It's going to be a little bit.
[53:01.10]There's got to be like muscle back here.
[53:09.04]It sounds like a shoulder.
[53:15.46]He's fine.
[53:17.32]See what I'm saying?
[53:19.78]He's fine.
[53:33.17]Back a little bit like right there.
[53:48.13]Blend it.
[53:49.22]Where's my blend tool?
[53:53.34]Still waiting for you to eat it?
[53:54.36]I told you it's actually dangerous to eat this.
[54:21.78]It almost looks like he's about to slump over.
[54:27.05]DAS modeling is safe for children.
[54:29.76]Well, I don't know.
[54:38.19]So he's got a little more definition in his arm.
[54:41.60]Actually has kind of like a shoulder.
[54:42.97]He needs like a little elbow here too.
[54:53.85]See what I mean?
[54:54.57]So now he has...
[54:58.45]I gotta fix that little divot, but...
[55:11.56]Actually, you know, I think that's fine.
[55:26.97]I think that's fine.
[55:27.60]Once the other armor's over here, it'll look better.
[55:36.84]Alright, second arm.
[55:37.76]Let's go dip it in the chocolate.
[55:50.21]Name this Revelations?
[55:56.74]What?
[56:07.13]I gotta get like the elbow.
[56:08.68]There you go.
[56:09.06]See like the elbow?
[56:09.86]I'm looking for that kind of chunk.
[56:13.54]Right there.
[56:14.32]Flatten that out like that.
[56:17.36]You see?
[56:38.13]That needs work.
[56:42.85]This needs work.
[56:48.51]Give him a Game Boy?
[56:49.50]Bro, I can't put...
[56:55.08]Alright, we'll give him a Game Boy on his chest.
[56:57.16]He's holding a Game Boy.
[56:58.07]This'll be a Game Boy.
[57:02.16]Boom.
[57:02.76]Here we go.
[57:03.99]Game Boy speedrun.
[57:14.65]What does the Game Boy look like?
[57:36.01]Do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do, do.
[57:42.17]down down down down down down down down down down down down down down down
[57:51.56]This is going to be over.
[57:52.55]Everyone has a leg.
[57:53.74]I don't want you to be able to see it.
[58:13.83]Fucked it up.
[58:42.38]Like a stone tablet.
[59:08.46]Okay, well, that looks like shit.
[59:09.75]That's good enough.
[59:58.41]It's fine.
[60:01.04]I would call that fine.
[60:03.23]I'm not happy about it.
[60:05.72]But he smashed it.
[60:10.39]He smashed it because he was in a gaming session and he was like, bro, I fucking hate this level.
[60:16.84]Alright, right there.
[60:32.27]Okay.
[60:39.46]Didn't a Game Boy survive a World War II explosion?
[60:42.10]Probably.
[60:44.53]Alright.
[60:45.11]Now...
[60:49.99]I'm going to fix this other arm.
[60:53.50]It actually looks good from this angle too.
[60:54.89]Actually, I'm very happy about this.
[60:57.36]I think it looks okay.
[60:59.95]I think it looks OK.
[61:04.83]I think it looks OK. Alright, let's fix this arm here.
[61:14.43]Because this needs to connect up here.
[61:15.78]Always use a clean workstation.
[61:29.68]Looks like my toupee.
[61:36.68]It's a pretty fancy toupee.
[61:39.13]I'm going to add the shoulder here too, like right there.
[61:41.54]What is it?
[61:43.33]Right now, when you're laying down, it'd be kind of bunched up behind you or above you.
[61:47.94]I don't know.
[62:08.07]Maybe this gives back a hair.
[62:13.00]He's chilling.
[62:13.60]He's chilling, yeah.
[62:15.67]I actually kind of like the game.
[62:17.11]I like the Game Boy being a little rough.
[62:20.65]That's to it.
[62:39.24]There needs to be more up here.
[62:42.63]It's getting kind of hard.
[62:45.20]What are you making?
[62:48.10]I don't know.
[62:48.44]That's a good question.
[62:52.84]Something something
[62:59.41]I think the detail work with the seat is gonna really pop it off.
[63:06.82]Let me get this shoulder.
[63:14.88]Give him water.
[63:15.63]He's dry as fuck.
[63:18.94]It's alright.
[63:20.11]I kind of want him to set a little bit.
[63:23.94]He's dry as fuck.
[63:27.34]He's alright.
[63:29.85]We'll fix him.
[63:32.38]I don't want to mess up that eye, though.
[63:37.09]alright let's get that shoulder that shoulder cap you know what I mean like it's like that like
[63:48.18]A little something like that.
[63:50.16]Shoulder.
[63:52.13]It's a little more rounded than that.
[63:55.14]It's like this.
[63:59.04]That kind of nub, you know what I mean?
[64:01.18]It's a little too much.
[64:08.63]Don't drop anything.
[64:09.67]He's dry as fuck.
[64:16.53]That shoulder cap is going to go right there, right here, right there, right there.
[64:30.01]And then I'll blend it in here.
[64:34.06]Oh, he is pretty dry.
[64:35.45]Okay, he is pretty dry back here.
[64:42.82]But he's just laying down.
[64:43.74]He's chilling.
[64:47.64]He's turning into stone.
[64:49.07]He is fine.
[65:32.62]That's got to be tighter.
[65:35.60]Okay, I gotta figure out where does his body end and where does the rock or sofa or...
[65:40.73]It's a rock.
[65:41.62]Let's be real, guys.
[65:42.62]You know what I mean?
[65:43.25]It's a fucking rock that ain't that ain't turned into no sofa.
[66:12.78]I don't like that.
[66:17.27]He's dry.
[66:17.73]He's dry.
[66:25.64]He's turning into dust.
[66:32.70]He's alright.
[66:33.21]He's fine.
[66:35.29]Okay.
[66:37.11]I got the arms.
[66:39.85]I've got the legs pretty much gone here.
[66:44.77]I got I'm going to work on the head.
[66:47.85]This is a little Game Boy.
[66:53.92]get a good look underneath.
[66:55.08]That eye has to be closed.
[67:01.26]That's what we're working with.
[67:02.47]Let me get you a good view.
[67:05.23]That's what I'm worried about.
[67:06.27]See that closed eye?
[67:07.10]Okay.
[67:12.38]I don't want to mess with this too much because I like what it's doing.
[67:17.26]But we have to add a little bit of that over here.
[67:30.32]Give me this thing.
[67:38.95]Alright, pray.
[68:04.09]good we want a little bit of bunch up here because supposed to be an eye closing like an eyelid
[68:20.86]Beautiful.
[68:22.55]Beautiful.
[68:28.89]See what I'm doing?
[68:30.48]I'm getting like in here.
[68:32.93]Like in there.
[68:33.55]Now I'm going to do the mouth.
[68:37.38]Mouth is going to be a little harder.
[68:40.81]What color are you going to paint it?
[68:43.11]I'm thinking gray.
[68:44.94]I think a gray, off-white, stone kind of color.
[69:05.98]He's kind of drooling.
[69:20.66]That looks great.
[69:21.87]I actually like it a lot.
[69:25.23]I might bring you guys down here.
[69:26.65]You can see what I'm talking about.
[69:47.09]This side needs a lot of help, though.
[69:48.68]But I actually am happy with that.
[69:52.06]I don't think I want to do anything to it.
[69:55.49]Is this Play-Doh time?
[69:58.03]You know what?
[69:59.10]It's a new year.
[69:59.95]We're turning over a new leaf.
[70:05.38]threaten to time that person out for five minutes okay feels good alright
[70:14.21]It's a little too happy over here.
[70:16.28]I don't like the smile.
[70:18.35]I think this has to kind of close up a little.
[70:21.58]Because if he's sleeping, I feel like this would be closed up a little more than it is.
[70:24.84]This eye needs to be fixed too.
[70:27.05]So pray.
[70:29.60]It's a little too happy.
[70:30.74]You know what I mean?
[70:31.27]It's got to be kind of.
[70:38.22]closed up a little bit more.
[70:43.03]That's good.
[70:43.63]That looks a lot better already.
[71:01.10]There we go.
[71:02.97]Okay, I don't like that, though.
[71:04.38]I gotta fix that.
[71:06.65]We have a surgery we need to do.
[71:09.34]Surgery.
[71:35.19]Surgery was a success.
[71:53.08]Surgery was a success.
[72:17.18]I'm going to fix this eye up here too.
[72:18.56]I need the little one.
[72:23.09]Oh.
[72:24.66]Duh.
[73:04.88]Sorry, I'm being quiet.
[73:05.73]This is incredibly important.
[73:09.11]If I screw this up, I fucked the whole project up.
[73:49.96]yes okay there was a part that was a slit right here that I had to kind of really
[74:00.62]No, don't do that.
[74:20.08]Okay, I'm not going to fuck with this part because I like the texture up here.
[74:26.30]And when you start trying to fuck with it too much...
[74:41.58]Okay.
[75:15.80]Kind of looks like a little cheekbone, which is fine.
[75:18.19]I like it.
[75:36.39]Have a backstory for this?
[75:38.07]No.
[75:39.52]Just a guy.
[75:42.25]Just a little guy.
[75:49.95]It's a little rhino.
[75:57.51]Cool.
[75:58.11]Okay.
[75:58.59]I like it.
[76:02.73]This eye needs to be closed a little more.
[76:05.00]See on this side?
[76:11.54]Let me get you a better view.
[76:12.80]Okay.
[76:14.27]See how this eye is closed?
[76:16.57]And he's got that mouth.
[76:18.30]I got to close that.
[76:19.04]And then I have to re-texture his head.
[76:23.30]Well, I guess Monak could be open a little more because he's fallen asleep with his Game Boy, so...
[76:27.86]I feel like you would do that.
[76:29.43]Uh, but... Prey.
[76:33.27]Looks like a dry.
[76:34.04]I got it.
[76:36.19]I got him.
[76:46.32]Okay, let's go like this.
[77:08.86]We need that little texture here.
[77:21.45]Happy birthday.
[77:22.30]Whose birthday is it?
[77:23.03]Happy birthday.
[77:24.04]Whoever it is.
[77:33.73]Happy birthday!
[77:35.46]Wow!
[77:48.70]Alright, now I want to do, I think that I'm happy with that.
[77:50.89]I think that's fine.
[77:53.86]See his eyes closed a little more.
[77:55.21]It's kind of not like open.
[77:58.96]You get the little texture on the top there.
[78:02.04]What is that?
[78:04.84]I don't want that.
[78:09.71]What the hell is happening?
[78:11.42]I thought my chat just broke.
[78:12.84]What was that?
[78:14.27]Oh, this is your little sub, so thank you.
[78:18.43]Appreciate it.
[78:20.90]I thought I saw the chat just explode.
[78:23.76]I was like, what the hell just happened?
[78:26.69]Appreciate it.
[78:29.10]I don't really shout out subs, but I guess I'm just sitting here looking at the chat like this is the thing I'm paying attention to.
[78:36.63]I guess, hey, thank you, Captain Nigel.
[78:41.07]It's the first time I've shouted out a sub in like fucking six years.
[78:48.02]But I'm going to keep it that way.
[78:50.73]I'm going to keep it that way.
[78:51.86]I need to fix this big time.
[78:53.83]Hold on.
[78:54.72]Okay.
[79:05.67]Okay, crisis averted.
[79:08.12]Crisis averted.
[79:22.21]Alright, time to wet him and retexture him.
[79:28.23]And then I'm going to move on to the bottom.
[80:04.31]Little extra there a little extra because guys eyes are closed
[80:27.26]And then we'll kind of let them dry out a little bit.
[80:34.77]I don't want this to pool like it is.
[80:40.34]Are we supposed to know what this is?
[80:43.51]I'll take a guess.
[80:48.19]It is Crunchy from Animal Crossing.
[80:54.09]My favorite character.
[81:05.11]Fuck up.
[81:13.45]How's the Game Boy look?
[81:19.47]Time to do the...
[81:27.45]Alright, this has got to be fixed.
[81:28.63]Hold on.
[81:49.76]They all have like a double mouth.
[81:51.74]I guess that's like a little chin.
[81:52.73]Yeah, I like it.
[82:20.93]The Game Boy is still magically intact, which is crazy.
[82:29.24]Alright, we're going to do feet texture.
[82:36.94]What do you think?
[82:41.87]I'm thinking it's going to be maybe just a few lines.
[83:08.13]Oh, he's breaking.
[83:08.96]He's breaking.
[83:10.93]He's fine.
[83:13.28]Don't worry.
[83:32.02]So give me this.
[84:03.23]Quiet time.
[84:09.81]Surgery.
[84:21.13]It's like these are separated.
[84:22.08]That's kind of cool.
[84:23.38]And I like that.
[84:33.43]Oh, damn.
[84:34.86]Okay, this is like a double ruck.
[84:37.10]He's got his feet up on like a slab of rucks.
[84:41.16]We're going to actually do that.
[84:42.42]Put your foot this way.
[84:51.96]Better?
[85:10.10]It's an ottoman?
[85:10.69]Yeah, it looks like an ottoman.
[85:13.26]See what I'm doing here?
[85:23.79]I actually need just like a... Let's do my fingers.
[85:25.95]Yeah.
[85:26.51]Easier that way.
[85:36.76]You're so locked in.
[85:38.89]I mean, kind of a little bit.
[85:41.24]Hey, I promised you guys I was going to do this like a year ago and I wanted to do it.
[85:45.69]So, I mean, I'm here, I'm going in.
[85:48.24]I'm gonna try to do what I'm gonna do.
[85:49.69]I'm gonna try at least make something as decent as I can.
[85:54.70]I know I'm fucking around a lot, but I want to at least make it passable for me.
[86:13.69]I like how that looks like a rock.
[86:20.28]That needs to be retextured.
[86:26.19]the foot look wicked fucked up or is it me it needs to be shifted a little
[86:39.37]I call this piece Baby Rhino Plays
[86:45.38]bunk for Game Boy at 10 o'clock at night and it's way past his bedtime.
[86:52.40]There.
[86:58.29]You think I need to move the foot a little more?
[86:59.61]See what I mean?
[87:05.26]Should I lift it up?
[87:12.33]Up a little more, right?
[87:35.06]Actually, I think that's alright.
[87:36.56]Come on.
[87:39.51]Can we just protect him at all costs?
[87:42.90]I'll do what I can.
[87:45.20]I'm just trying to smooth out some of this bullshit.
[87:47.96]It doesn't have to be perfect, but you know.
[87:50.51]I don't want it to look like dog shit.
[87:54.11]That's alright if it does.
[87:55.63]Who gives a shit?
[88:02.43]It's always hard to do.
[88:04.94]hands and feet because especially when you get to the point where you need to make like all the appendages and shit like it everything kind of break apart
[88:20.81]Because it has to get so small.
[88:22.00]And I know you can really start making little tiny...
[88:26.75]You know, I'm going to make his thumb and it's like a tiny little thing.
[88:29.94]I don't really have the tools.
[88:31.00]I don't know if to, to really do that.
[88:33.56]And my dexterity in my hands is not great.
[88:37.63]so I don't think I'd be able to do it perfectly I would have to do with a tool like this and just kind of you know like a little stabber and just
[88:46.93]Artists hate doing hands and feet.
[88:48.32]Yeah, that's what I've heard.
[88:49.89]I've heard they're the most annoying to do.
[88:54.44]Okay.
[88:55.10]Let me clean up a little.
[88:56.37]Because it's kind of a mess.
[89:00.23]And I'll go from here.
[89:05.39]I actually kind of need some of these pieces.
[89:07.33]Let me wet them.
[89:14.44]I think hands are easier than eyes.
[89:15.93]I feel like it's all hard.
[89:21.96]Holly is an artist, obviously, like you guys know.
[89:26.22]And I'll ask her this question.
[89:27.49]She'll kind of be doing something.
[89:29.84]I'll go, how do you even...
[89:31.50]Like, how do you even turn that just streak of just, oh, that's just blue digital paint.
[89:38.92]How do you turn that into a guy smiling?
[89:41.40]It's just crazy.
[89:43.87]How do you go from that first line to, oh, and this is, it's Super Mario and he's jumping.
[89:51.09]My brain has a logistical breakdown.
[89:54.40]trying to do it.
[89:56.87]I think way too far ahead.
[89:58.48]Which I think that's why I like to do clay stuff whenever I have a chance.
[90:02.07]Because I don't have to think ahead.
[90:08.33]You just draw circles.
[90:09.48]Yeah.
[90:15.68]But there are a lot of talented people
[90:19.22]And doing this, this is kind of like a piece of shit.
[90:24.06]It's my piece of shit.
[90:26.37]But seeing what people can do with all these different mediums, it's just impressive to know that what I'm doing
[90:33.36]It's just kind of goofy, you know, novice type stuff.
[90:36.93]And...
[90:39.18]It just makes you appreciate what people can actually do that make this their full-time job and their full-time
[90:45.71]Oh yeah, I'd make the miniatures for Paranorman.
[90:49.69]It's like, holy shit, that's kind of, that's crazy.
[90:53.51]It makes you appreciate it more when you actually kind of sit down and do it.
[90:56.26]Because you just go, what?
[90:57.02]I just made a fucking elephant.
[90:58.12]Like, how the hell did you make Paranorman's face?
[91:02.44]So.
[91:03.77]It is, it is what it is.
[91:05.27]Alright.
[91:05.57]So, uh, I want to, alright, we've got to figure out the other leg, clean the rest of this up.
[91:20.22]He mentioned Paranorman.
[91:21.62]Is it the first thing I can think of?
[91:29.13]Okay, let me get this better.
[91:30.94]All the little bits.
[91:37.28]This is useful.
[91:38.33]I need this.
[91:39.09]This is going to be useful.
[91:41.79]Alright.
[91:51.12]Let's get a good view.
[91:52.02]I liked it.
[91:53.51]Oh, not my cashmere carpets.
[91:59.30]$75,000 for those carpets.
[92:01.21]I'm kidding.
[92:05.13]Okay.
[92:08.16]We do the other leg and then we can mess around with some other stuff.
[92:12.19]I actually think he's perfect.
[92:16.47]I'll take a few pictures of it too.
[92:18.01]And I'll post them somewhere.
[92:19.34]Like maybe I'll show them next stream.
[92:20.73]Because maybe I'll paint it.
[92:21.45]Maybe I'll just paint it.
[92:22.96]Off stream because I want it to harden.
[92:26.12]Although this clay kind of doesn't really harden that well.
[92:32.04]We've got to do a lot of work over here though.
[92:33.45]This is not even close.
[92:36.02]This is not even close.
[92:40.50]because this is actually okay, let's go like this.
[92:50.05]Is that leg too thick?
[92:58.99]We're going to get some of the innards of this out.
[93:03.37]Those are a little more defined sitting.
[93:25.77]I need to get in there.
[93:26.78]Hold on.
[93:33.92]You're going to disembowel them?
[93:35.55]I'm being very gentle.
[93:42.72]What the fuck are you talking about?
[93:48.49]I want it to be like... Yeah, that's better.
[93:52.86]This would be a little bit more of a hump here.
[93:54.37]I actually don't...
[93:56.90]I think it's fine the way it is.
[94:01.95]He's just kind of chilling.
[94:02.85]That's fine.
[94:21.85]That's a thick leg.
[94:32.06]I think it's a little too thick.
[94:33.27]Hold on.
[94:35.22]Let's squish him up a little.
[94:42.15]Alright, that's better.
[95:02.31]Did I stab him?
[95:05.89]Did I stab him in the face?
[95:07.24]No, I didn't.
[95:07.76]Did I?
[95:15.68]Oh my, don't stab yourself.
[95:17.45]I'm gonna fucking get hurt on stream.
[95:36.70]Definition.
[95:55.35]Alright, this is how we really take this shit to the next level.
[95:57.63]I need more clay, though.
[96:05.68]Don't mess with my clay over there.
[96:07.31]I'm making a sculpture for my landlord's birthday.
[96:25.78]Refine that ass.
[96:27.32]I'm going.
[96:36.49]Can we watch videos in the corner?
[96:40.68]I guess there really hasn't been any music or anything, right?
[96:43.07]It's just been silent men doing surgery on clay baby elephant.
[96:48.49]That sounds like a fucking...
[96:50.84]That sounds like an Elsagate video.
[96:53.71]That sounds like a fucked up video that you would find, right?
[96:56.91]Like, that's a weird video.
[97:10.66]Alright, I'm working on that ass area.
[97:14.44]Look.
[97:16.55]I'm working on the back section.
[97:20.49]Don't worry.
[97:28.21]I stabbed him and now that person just fucked with me.
[97:32.07]I stabbed him in the leg!
[97:37.48]You can't even see it.
[97:38.81]You can't notice it.
[97:39.32]It's fine.
[97:39.68]Alright.
[97:40.28]I got a good spot.
[97:41.25]Here we go.
[97:55.92]It's got to be way more wept.
[98:14.60]I don't want it to be super... Because I can paint it.
[98:18.68]So it doesn't need to be completely defined.
[98:20.90]Like, oh look, he's sitting on top of something.
[98:22.81]He can kind of be mushed into it a little.
[98:25.07]When you lay down on a bed or a sofa, you're kind of smooshed into it.
[98:29.65]There's not space between you...
[98:32.66]and the bed you're kind of smushed in but I do agree
[98:59.24]He needs like a bed.
[99:04.90]It's definitely a beanbag, but it's a beanbag with an...
[99:09.16]Ottoman?
[99:11.81]This sounds kind of weird.
[99:13.70]You need music, man?
[99:15.01]I think we're getting close to being done.
[99:19.52]I want to mess with that stuff, but we're only talking about probably like another 20, 30 minutes.
[99:24.98]Pretty sure this is kind of close.
[99:28.33]I like how it's a rock, though.
[99:30.66]So breaking up a little is not a problem for me.
[99:45.64]Again, I don't want it to be super defined, but that's fine.
[99:49.05]Cause how was he laying down?
[99:50.42]I guess you could, if you had a head that was like this, you could probably do that.
[100:03.21]Got to fix that.
[100:12.04]What's the right way to approach this?
[100:43.29]Fuck!
[100:43.84]I stabbed him again!
[100:50.44]I suck with this tool.
[100:52.32]I'm terrible with this thing.
[100:57.13]I'm trying to make like a little more like it's a kind of a little double rock.
[101:04.47]That's better.
[101:13.02]Okay.
[101:15.12]I think I'm happy with this at the moment.
[101:19.30]we did stab him in the leg let's do one more little pass with the texture machine thingy
[101:30.61]That back is fucked up.
[101:42.93]He's kind of got a pretty big cranium.
[101:45.46]Well, actually, I like that, though.
[101:49.37]I'll try to get you a good kind of total view.
[101:52.97]of what it looks like so far.
[102:11.55]It's Game Boy.
[102:18.66]It's resting.
[102:20.63]He's chilling out.
[102:26.72]He's on his rock.
[102:31.93]Hey, you sculpting yourself?
[102:35.06]Yeah.
[102:41.58]His head's a little bit bigger on this side, which is a little weird, but...
[102:48.97]I could do a little bit more work on it.
[102:54.81]I think this is the good side here.
[102:56.26]That's the side that you want right there.
[103:02.40]That's the good shot right there.
[103:06.37]I closed both and then with paint, it'll look a little better.
[103:19.97]Name him.
[103:20.76]And yes, paint him.
[103:21.56]I'll try to paint it.
[103:23.13]I think painting it would be a fun idea.
[103:25.90]But... Should I ruin it?
[103:30.39]Should I ruin it?
[103:32.33]This arm needs more work.
[103:35.00]Paint can really make a difference, but...
[103:44.41]I think I might want to texture him again.
[103:47.20]Well, I'm saying this goofy shit over here, put it all over him.
[103:49.79]I feel like paint would make this a little more interesting.
[103:54.57]Because then I could really define where things were.
[103:57.72]Paint does a lot of heavy lifting in a lot of ways.
[104:03.11]Give Vegas arms a little bigger.
[104:06.21]Yeah, definitely needs a little more definition on his arm.
[104:10.72]I can fix that.
[104:13.32]I think we've got a good gist of it, though.
[104:15.26]A little like baby rhinoceros sleeping on a beanbag chair with an ottoman.
[104:21.87]This is an interesting take on art.
[104:24.88]Trying to get banned?
[104:27.88]You trying to get banned?
[104:31.40]Alright, now this is the part of the stream where I make one person laugh.
[104:37.13]by fucking smashing his like just smushing him down and then sprinting over to hit the end screen button
[104:50.58]Alright, let me... Actually, I just want to play with this next stuff.
[104:53.27]We'll make something quick.
[104:55.51]I'm not going to do that.
[105:09.24]he's cute okay now imagine if I was gonna make him get up stretch his arms and go oh
[105:18.77]That'll be three weeks.
[105:21.78]Do you understand how hard this shit is for people to do that?
[105:26.74]That'll be three weeks of doing that every day.
[105:32.56]He ain't gonna make it off the sofa, I don't think.
[105:36.02]The eyes look alright.
[105:38.68]Yeah, I like it.
[105:40.71]I didn't really give him nostrils, but I'm afraid to.
[105:48.93]He's got kind of a little bit of a Joker mouth on the other side, though.
[105:51.67]Oh, somebody said a good tip to get him off.
[105:54.08]Get the little guy off the tray.
[105:55.74]Get both ends of the wire tool into each hand.
[105:58.79]Then you need to twirl it a bit until it's slack.
[106:03.00]After that, you need to slowly put it under the button.
[106:05.92]Yeah, so kind of slide this under and... Yep.
[106:10.92]I'm going to do that later.
[106:15.09]I could wait.
[106:15.69]You know what?
[106:15.99]I could do this.
[106:17.09]Yeah.
[106:19.08]Ready?
[106:19.95]Where are nostrils?
[106:20.87]Oh, I got rhinoceros.

[106:58.40]Do you remember what the fuck are you doing?
[106:59.79]Shut up.
[107:02.54]Do you see what we're working here?
[107:03.71]Do you see we're trying to come up with a fucking solution to a problem?
[107:07.33]Tip of the nose, like right there?
[107:14.84]Right here?
[107:15.50]You think right there?
[107:34.09]Yeah!
[107:37.90]What did you bake?
[107:38.92]This is a baby rhinoceros
[107:42.26]who fell asleep playing Game Boy, bonk for the Game Boy, the original green screen Game Boy.
[107:48.24]He's laying down on a beanbag and an ottoman.
[107:54.21]Okay?
[107:56.38]Capiche?
[107:59.88]And then I'm gonna probably paint it.
[108:01.79]And then...
[108:04.30]I'm gonna auction it for as much money as I can possibly get for this.
[108:11.80]Ain't getting this, sorry.
[108:15.00]I'm painting this and it's going on the red shelf.
[108:20.49]He does kind of have like a little bit of a joker mouth.
[108:22.34]I'll be honest.
[108:27.20]I like this side's my favorite.
[108:32.60]I feel like I can not really get you the best angle.
[108:39.91]is the vision there do you see the vision is the vision available for you to see
[108:53.27]Alright, poll and chat.
[108:55.36]And I want you to be honest.
[108:58.17]For the first ever, look at me, I'm naked.
[109:02.65]I'm doing art on stream.
[109:04.36]I'm naked.
[109:09.42]Yay or nay?
[109:12.09]Yay or nay?
[109:14.82]Be honest with me.
[109:15.40]Yay or nay?
[109:23.28]We got to get the real deal here now.
[109:30.50]I don't love his arm here, but I think I could fix it later.
[109:34.59]I do like what's happening with him, though.
[109:46.87]This one.
[109:48.46]Did you like it?
[109:48.90]Did you guys do this one?
[109:49.78]Do you like it?
[109:52.68]13 people said nay.
[110:00.15]That's way more than 13.
[110:01.49]I can't even see it yet.
[110:04.92]I, by the way, my hair is probably awful.
[110:07.84]I've noticed I usually touch my hair and face every 10 seconds.
[110:11.50]I could not do that right now.
[110:13.84]No way.
[110:14.38]So I probably look like Animal from the Muppets.
[110:22.10]I do want to just open this one up, though, because I feel like I like the way this one feels good.
[110:26.57]95%, damn.
[110:28.78]You guys are just being nice.
[110:30.38]25 people said nay.
[110:32.90]That's fine.
[110:35.83]Getting coal for Christmas next year.
[110:41.52]Yeah, let me just see this stuff.
[110:44.21]I'm going to let him chill for a little bit.
[110:45.54]I like him how he is at the moment.
[110:46.87]I kind of want to mess with this.
[111:01.27]I don't know why I got this.
[111:06.67]Is it floam?
[111:07.75]It is kind of like floam.
[111:08.63]Maybe I'll just make a...
[111:10.62]I don't know.
[111:10.90]Let's see.
[111:13.53]I always like the way this stuff felt in your hand.
[111:42.68]I guess that's it.
[111:45.75]I don't really know what else to do with this.
[111:48.52]Give him some meat.
[111:49.44]Here, we'll give him some meat snacks.
[111:52.34]No, don't ruin it.
[111:54.24]No.
[111:54.32]No.
[111:58.00]Alright, hold on.
[112:00.11]Speed sculpt.
[112:02.40]Give me one minute.
[112:04.57]Ready?
[112:06.78]Go.
[112:55.51]The snack that smiles back.
[113:03.18]Come on.
[113:08.98]Don't you think it's funny that they sell goldfish in tubs?
[113:14.44]Actual gigantic tubs of it.
[113:18.02]I don't think there's, is there any other snack food on Earth that comes in a gigantic milk carton that's five gallons?
[113:26.39]They don't, like, Lay's potato chips don't come in a three-gallon jug.
[113:32.61]Cheese balls, right, okay, that's another one.
[113:35.49]Maybe a box of pretzels?
[113:50.19]Ow!
[113:51.50]Careful.
[114:10.37]okay good looks great don't put them on that gross thing
[114:20.83]Wait, I'm going to set him next to his friend.
[114:23.86]Don't touch him.
[114:24.74]He's way more precious than you.
[114:39.77]This is the other one I wanted to play with.
[114:43.78]This is Model Magic.
[114:48.63]I don't know how well this is going to last.
[114:51.01]I always thought this stuff felt really cool.
[114:57.23]Again, I'm going to do another speedrun.
[115:08.32]yeah this one's that smells that smells like like I don't know like plastic or something is that supposed to smell
[115:21.31]That filled the room with a scent.
[115:26.77]That doesn't seem like a whole lot.
[115:28.38]Well, maybe not.
[115:28.88]We'll see.
[115:33.75]It's staining my fucking hands.
[115:36.16]Alright, speed run.
[115:39.66]Oh, this does feel kind of good, though.
[116:06.10]Why do you always start with a penis?
[116:07.55]I'm just moving it around.
[116:48.12]Kind of like what's going on here.
[118:15.38]Sorry, the fish is fucking dead, dude.
[118:31.17]There's a crazy frog.
[118:32.86]Now flatten the head out.

[120:27.65]Wait a minute.
[120:29.07]Oh, hold on.

[120:57.52]I made this monster.
[120:59.50]You go, whoa, I wonder where the mess is because it's probably everywhere.
[121:05.47]And that's what you came up with.
[121:07.45]The rest of the clay and the paint is probably all over the bedroom.
[121:12.75]So where's the rest of it?
[121:30.50]It needs to be thinner.
[121:57.52]This is never going to stay on him.

[122:50.06]Alright, hey, we'll just take a fucking screenshot, okay?
[123:06.49]Oh, dude, it's time for the nightmare blunt rotation.
[123:10.19]Hey, dude.
[123:13.41]I don't want to pretend to do that, Clay.

[124:53.89]Alright, that's going to be it.
[124:56.34]I'll take a couple of better pictures of this so you can see with more high resolution.
[125:00.58]As he's drying out, he actually looks really cool.
[125:03.10]I actually like it a lot.
[125:04.69]Hey, he is what it is.
