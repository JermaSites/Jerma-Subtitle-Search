[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.45]Hello.
[00:03.55]Good afternoon, everybody.
[00:07.79]Just realized that my Wiimote doesn't have a strap.
[00:12.93]Physically, it doesn't.
[00:13.91]I don't have one.
[00:16.61]Why?
[00:19.14]Where'd it go?
[00:21.88]I gotta be careful.
[00:23.86]Don't want to put a hole in my monitor's head.
[00:28.20]He's not using protection.
[00:33.07]Unsafe?
[00:33.59]That's unsafe.
[00:36.39]It's not that unsafe.
[00:37.73]As long as you don't play a game that requires you to, like, throw or move really quickly.
[00:43.01]And the only movements in No More Heroes are you just shake.
[00:49.20]You know, I... If... Do you need a strap for a salt shaker or a pepper shaker?
[00:56.12]No.
[00:57.40]That'd be kind of odd.
[01:02.64]That's the same motion that I'm doing in this game.
[01:08.55]Anyways, we're going to continue No More Heroes.
[01:10.55]We're probably going to get to the end tonight.
[01:14.85]Pepper Shakers have a thick base.
[01:16.19]This is like as heavy as a Pepper Shaker is.
[01:20.77]We are currently rank 6.
[01:22.63]Assassin level.
[01:25.45]Climbing the ladder.
[01:27.96]And then tomorrow...
[01:30.43]It is New Year's Eve.
[01:32.17]Tomorrow we'll be doing a little bit of festivities.
[01:37.05]We'll be dropping the ball Eastern Time, not Pacific Time.
[01:40.84]Remember, that's important.
[01:45.76]It's going to be weird, though.
[01:47.50]I think I did this last year, too.
[01:49.76]It was like 8.59 p.m., and I'm like, here we go!
[01:53.06]Ted!
[01:54.58]It's like 9 p.m.
[01:55.40]It's 9 o'clock where I am.
[02:00.99]But we'll do that tomorrow.
[02:05.53]He's going to drop his balls.
[02:09.23]I knew that was going to show up somewhere.
[02:10.52]I just didn't know when.
[02:15.04]Do a countdown for every time zone in the world.
[02:18.36]I'm not doing that.
[02:23.53]Winks are scams.
[02:24.67]Purple gang rise up.
[02:27.15]Well, you just dropped 1,200 channel points.
[02:30.84]You could have saved to get to 75,000 and got me to turn my camera on and wink.
[02:35.80]That's too bad.
[02:36.46]Alright, let's get going.
[02:39.81]Let me just... Give me one second.
[02:41.39]I'll be... I'll be here.
[02:43.94]I'm just moving something around.
[02:44.84]Give me one second.
[03:06.52]Yeah, that's true.
[03:07.26]Somebody just mentioned... When is the first New Year?
[03:11.28]Australia?
[03:13.32]When is the first 2020?
[03:16.82]Somewhere in Australia?
[03:17.98]New Zealand?
[03:24.66]It's in New Zealand.
[03:25.24]Alright.
[03:25.54]So, when?
[03:29.87]When?
[03:30.21]Or, like, I mean, like, relative to, like, hours from now, when is it 2020 for the first place?
[03:35.47]First time.
[03:39.15]It already happened.
[03:48.27]No, it didn't.
[03:49.37]New Year's is first celebrated on the small island nations of Tonga.
[03:53.59]Okay.
[03:57.65]Well, happy... When is it?
[03:58.69]Let's see.
[03:59.07]I'm going to look up what time is it in Tonga right now.
[04:04.16]Tonga time.
[04:07.14]It is 1.02.
[04:07.48]Yeah, it's 1 p.m.
[04:10.18]December 31st.
[04:12.80]Okay.
[04:13.84]We might be live when the first ever 2020 happens.
[04:16.22]It might be possible.
[04:18.92]No, we won't.
[04:19.46]I'm not gonna be live in 12 hours.
[04:21.10]What the fuck am I talking about?
[04:24.46]Oh yeah, we're gonna be live in 12 hours.
[04:29.44]No way, that's not happening.
[04:33.04]It ain't gonna take me that long to finish no more heroes.
[04:36.22]Maybe six to seven.
[04:40.63]Alright, welcome back.
[04:41.89]Let's, uh, play with the cat.
[04:43.63]Those of you that weren't here yesterday, this is the most important thing in the game.
[05:01.77]Hold on, this is a one-guy scenario, I need to read this.
[05:04.64]Jerma, how do you describe a streamer to someone who doesn't understand anything about the internet?
[05:10.12]Um... That was like four in a row.
[05:22.67]Okay, I feel like I'm playing Battlefield right now.
[05:25.28]What the fuck was that?
[05:30.74]Uh... What are you doing?
[05:34.79]What?
[05:36.79]Wait a minute.
[05:37.83]Wait, hold on.
[05:39.67]Did... Um... Freddy... Freddy... You gave 23,000 bits last night.
[05:47.27]And now you've dropped 75,000...
[05:59.12]bits right now that's a fucking hundred thousand bits in not even 12 24 hours you madman holy shit that's a thousand dollars in bits funding for the 2020 carnival
[06:27.82]Freddy Dredd, seriously.
[06:28.94]Holy fuck, man.
[06:30.20]That's ridiculous.
[06:32.34]They say, Happy New Year's, Jerma.
[06:33.60]Thank you for making this year hilarious for me.
[06:39.36]Freddy Dredd Gaming.
[06:41.85]Holy shit, man.
[06:43.19]That's... That was so ridiculous.
[06:46.55]This is fucking crazy right now.
[06:48.73]Somebody just said, that wasn't even a car, that was a weed whacker.
[06:52.59]Um... Thank you... Seriously, uh...
[06:59.10]Shazzo just dropped 20 community subs, also.
[07:04.94]That was a tiny car, huge bits.
[07:07.58]Shazzo, 20 community subs, and fucking Freddy with, I think that's one of the biggest drops of money I've ever seen on stream, ever, in one drop.
[07:17.67]We've had, during the thing, was another scenario where there was like five, six, $700 worth of bits that would drop.
[07:24.05]It's fucking, this is unbelievable.
[07:29.74]Thank you.
[07:30.84]Happy New Year to you as well.
[07:33.39]Let's hope 2020 is interesting as well.
[07:36.87]That's a lot of money.
[07:44.25]That deserves a wink.
[07:46.27]You know what?
[07:47.23]It sure does.
[07:50.21]What was that frame?
[07:55.55]What was that?
[08:11.69]I think that was, that was, that wasn't, I wasn't naked.
[08:13.83]Hey.
[08:19.72]I can't wink, I know.
[08:22.10]You just, that's, thank you.
[08:23.36]75,000 bits equals 75,000 channel points.
[08:25.76]Give me my bike.
[08:42.43]Can somebody... It was you in a tank top looking at the camera.
[08:46.43]Can you clip that?
[08:47.91]Somebody show me.
[08:48.99]I want to see when that was.
[08:50.30]Was that from yesterday?
[08:51.24]No, it couldn't have been.
[08:53.98]Oh, I know what it was.
[08:55.20]I know what it was.
[08:56.04]I know what it was.
[08:56.68]Oh, fucking god damn it.
[09:00.83]Okay, so...
[09:03.86]Okay, let me explain what happened, okay?
[09:06.16]This is very important.
[09:08.92]That was from earlier today.
[09:10.76]That was... Look at the hair.
[09:12.60]I'll get it on stream.
[09:14.76]That was... Hold on.
[09:22.51]So, earlier this day, I got out of the shower.
[09:25.95]And I said, oh, okay, it's time.
[09:28.23]Let me set up my stream.
[09:29.19]Let me get, like, started here.
[09:30.39]Sounds good.
[09:37.25]And I turned on the camera.
[09:39.77]I was setting the camera up.
[09:40.59]And I realized I'm wearing the same shirt that I was wearing yesterday.
[09:46.23]The same tank top.
[09:49.07]So I was like, people are going to talk shit about this.
[09:52.69]They're going to be like, oh, you're in the same clothes as yesterday.
[09:57.03]And I'm just like, yeah, I have to.
[10:00.68]So I took off my shirt and put on another shirt.
[10:04.70]That's what happened.
[10:07.28]But, yeah, I got exposed anyways.
[10:08.87]So, there you go.
[10:13.17]What the fuck is going on with... Seventy... What the... Seventy... Five?
[10:20.61]What is happening today?
[10:21.77]Oh, god damn it.
[10:24.57]No, no, not god damn... Like... Seventy-five.
[10:34.62]People are finding ways to circumvent.
[10:37.40]That, alright.
[10:39.44]Cornmonster, that's 75 subs.
[10:41.83]You maniac.
[10:47.17]Holy shit.
[10:52.71]This is un-fucking-believable, guys.
[10:54.12]That's too much money.
[10:55.36]75 fucking subs from Cornmonster right now.
[11:02.99]And 75,000 bits.
[11:06.36]From Freddy.
[11:11.58]You guys are too... You guys are too kind.
[11:13.66]You guys spoil me.
[11:19.01]I'm just gonna spend it on McChickens.
[11:23.47]That's gonna buy a lot of pizzas.
[11:27.23]Well, it's...
[11:30.80]I can't even believe it.
[11:32.11]I'm forever fucking grateful that somebody would give this much money to this stream.
[11:41.23]And, uh, hopefully, hopefully all the money that comes into this channel, I can use it and try to make stuff that I think would be interesting.
[11:51.58]That's pretty much what it is.
[11:54.38]Pay to link streamer.
[11:56.32]I'm laughing my ass off.
[12:01.64]If you call yourself a Jerma fan, I'm fucking loaded on channel points, bro.
[12:04.74]Every message could weigh one.
[12:08.07]Where is this, by the way?
[12:18.06]All this for a thousand dollars.
[12:19.54]It's not even worth it.
[12:22.60]Try talking in chat again when you're a true fan.
[12:25.42]I highlight every message because I'm just that jacked.
[12:28.10]Oh, I see.
[12:34.91]But yeah, that was a big, huge money drops from a few people here.
[12:38.87]Um...
[12:45.22]Hopefully I can get this stupid thing out of the ground.
[12:48.18]Where- alright.
[12:49.66]Seriously, where is it?
[12:52.77]Why was my thing rumbling over there?
[12:54.45]What?
[13:01.53]Holy shit.
[13:07.71]Freddy... just gave 50- is that person naked?
[13:13.20]Freddy just gave 50 community subs.
[13:16.14]Wait, they're, what are they, fuck, they're tier two?
[13:20.41]These are tier two?
[13:21.61]What the fuck is going on?
[13:33.33]Holy shit.
[13:39.60]That's insane.
[13:43.71]50 tier 2 community subs from Freddy.
[13:46.69]Freddy Dredd.
[13:51.24]You've got to be kidding me.
[13:55.70]I had a dream last night that Jerma literally... What?
[13:59.14]What are you talking about?
[14:00.70]Alright, I have to...
[14:08.25]Why was that just in there?
[14:09.92]Why was that just in the part of it, like the chat?
[14:12.82]Why was that just in the chat?
[14:27.69]Anyways, holy fuck man, that's, that's insane.
[14:31.53]Tier 2, that's the most ridiculous thing I think I've ever seen.
[14:36.48]That's Freddy Dredd.
[14:37.14]Thank you, Freddy.
[14:37.74]Thank you, Evil Program 5 subs.
[14:39.46]Callie Brady 5 subs.
[14:42.76]I had a dream.
[14:43.52]What was it?
[14:44.00]I didn't... I didn't... Okay, I didn't, like, chill.
[14:48.17]I didn't see it.
[14:52.67]What the fuck?
[14:55.81]Coke Gaming.
[14:58.39]I had a dream.
[15:08.55]What was it?
[15:09.15]Just somebody PM it to me.
[15:10.57]Don't PM me!
[15:15.85]I don't know why that's so funny to me.
[15:36.59]Everyone was screaming TOS or cheering.
[15:40.33]What the fuck?
[15:45.67]Ugh.
[15:46.51]We haven't even started.
[15:47.29]I haven't even started streaming yet.
[15:53.12]Oh my god.
[15:54.16]Evil program.
[15:54.84]Five subs.
[15:55.26]Call of Duty.
[15:55.72]Five subs.
[15:57.88]Produces.
[15:58.94]Produce.
[16:04.20]Everybody was... Dude.
[16:07.82]I imagine having that dream, though.
[16:10.02]Like, I can't imagine having a dream like that.
[16:15.42]Produces... Alright, get it together.
[16:20.80]Produces... Produces San, thanks for the five subs.
[16:24.57]Slonk CR, thanks for the five subs.
[16:27.45]Seriously, guys.
[16:30.75]Henry1810 gave five subs.
[16:36.85]Jesus.
[16:40.58]I had a dream.
[16:41.34]Oh my god.
[16:42.46]I can't imagine waking up from that dream.
[16:44.72]I think that's one of those dreams where you wake up afterward.
[16:48.28]You look in the mirror and you just go like, why did I have that dream?
[16:52.98]Why did I have that dream?
[16:55.84]There's gotta be something.
[16:57.72]There's gotta be a reason why I'm having a dream like that.
[17:05.71]Oh my god.
[17:14.49]He watches too much.
[17:15.58]Yeah, but alright.
[17:16.58]There's a difference between watching too much and then having a dream that I'm having sex with somebody on stream.
[17:23.04]Why was the camera on?
[17:24.54]What are you having that dream for?
[17:31.95]Dude, this is fucked.
[17:33.61]I have to just do this mission.
[17:39.23]Oh.
[17:39.35]Oh.
[17:44.51]This is killing me.
[17:46.88]This is killi- I don't know why this is killing me.
[18:02.48]I don't, I can't, I know this is gonna sound crazy, this is gonna be fucked, just like, alright, just mute if you, oh, but seriously, like, I just picture, I just like, oh, you know like images that, like, you just, like, I just see the chat, and, like, the screen, like, it's, we're screen grabbing somebody's web browser, and it's just, that's on the video player, and there's a chat next to it, and it's like, all my, like, rules are underneath.
[18:34.11]What is this one?
[18:42.09]What was this one?
[18:42.67]I don't even remember.
[18:43.34]Oh, this one!
[19:03.35]Sometimes it only takes one thing that somebody says over here and it just fucks me up for the whole day.
[19:09.58]I'm gonna be thinking about that all day.
[19:11.02]It's gonna pop up into my brain.
[19:13.22]I'm just, I'm a very visual person.
[19:16.24]You know what I'm saying?
[19:17.72]Like I'm incredibly visual and I like, I will see the things that people say up in my head.
[19:24.41]And I'm gonna keep seeing that until tomorrow.
[19:34.08]What happened?
[19:35.30]Okay, I gotta relax.
[19:49.09]Jesus Christ.
[19:51.01]We're good.
[19:52.31]Very good.
[19:56.74]We're all good.
[19:59.00]A lot of money from this one.
[20:00.52]Welcome back, by the way, to This is No More Heroes.
[20:02.42]It's been 20 minutes on stream.
[20:04.02]What the fuck just happened?
[20:05.06]Is that it?
[20:17.68]One more!
[20:19.02]Did I get it?
[20:20.92]I didn't even see that they were on the ground.
[20:32.91]You got like a thousand dollars and then laughed at sex for ten minutes.
[20:35.89]That's what's happened.
[20:39.87]Yeah.
[20:42.53]That about sums it up.
[20:43.61]You're right.
[20:48.02]That's a pretty good recap.
[20:48.80]Oh, there's a new job.
[20:53.76]There's a new job.
[21:00.68]Can I still vote in the poll?
[21:01.86]Yes, you can.
[21:02.42]If we can get the poll in the chat, please.
[21:05.54]Check it out.
[21:07.16]You have until tomorrow afternoon to vote.
[21:09.82]JermaNYE19 on SurveyMonkey.
[21:11.52]That's the one.
[21:17.62]Alright, what's the new job?
[21:22.01]Mine sweeping.
[21:22.93]Oh, this is not the scorpions yet.
[21:25.37]Clean up the mines buried in the beach.
[21:26.83]A bonus will be paid due to how dangerous the work is.
[21:32.09]Okay.
[21:36.18]We're looking for high voter participation.
[21:38.98]Actually, I think I can look and see how many people have taken it so far.
[21:46.62]And, like, six cars drove by, a weed whacker drove by, like, a bicycle, like, that was a weird first ten minutes.
[21:53.06]Where do you vote on that SurveyMonkey page?
[22:10.86]Should be in the chat right now.
[22:19.85]Down to the beach.
[22:20.67]Let's do some minesweeping.
[22:22.53]How much money do we need?
[22:23.49]350?
[22:30.23]The unspoken rules of Santa Destroy indicate danger.
[22:34.53]No one swims on the beach here.
[22:36.94]So work persistently.
[22:37.70]How does this even work?
[23:02.90]Safely remove the mines buried in the beach.
[23:04.89]Listen to your metal detector to locate them.
[23:07.15]Then use your beam katana to destroy the mines.
[23:09.81]Do I need my... the Wiimote thing?
[23:18.75]Oh, this... Where is it?
[23:27.71]Where the hell is it?
[23:30.03]Oh, it's... That's when I get close enough.
[23:37.66]Am I insane?
[23:51.27]I'm insane.
[23:52.83]That scared the fuck out of me.
[23:55.67]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[24:01.79]Jesus.
[24:02.71]Wow.
[24:05.97]He's a bad gamer.
[24:07.05]He's a bad gamer.
[24:08.85]He's not a very good gamer.
[24:09.79]He's a bad gamer.
[24:17.08]I could change clothes, too.
[24:18.16]I can't.
[24:26.81]Well, where is it?
[24:36.51]How much are these worth?
[24:37.61]Because I only have three.
[24:49.40]Holy shit, it's right here.
[24:52.62]It's two thousand per mine?
[24:55.88]That sucks.
[24:56.38]I have to pick up trash.
[25:00.38]We gotta do each one once, though.
[25:10.98]Alright, close.
[25:11.72]Where is it?
[25:15.18]What just happened?
[25:16.32]Boomer, boomer, boomer.
[25:18.80]He's a boomer.
[25:27.66]It's gonna be 20,000.
[25:29.23]I'm gonna get a horrible grade.
[25:31.65]This might be the first non-placing grade of the whole entire gameplay.
[25:38.45]This is not gonna even be bronze.
[25:39.53]I might not even place it.
[25:51.11]You can't get below bronze?
[25:52.26]Really?
[25:58.32]Yeah, this one kind of sucks.
[26:00.20]I don't even remember this one.
[26:01.74]Let me get 10.
[26:02.10]Let me get a clean 10.
[26:04.83]Come on.
[26:05.91]Where is it?
[26:06.31]Where is it?
[26:06.59]Where is it?
[26:07.13]Come on, come on, come on, come on.
[26:09.51]Just step on it.
[26:10.53]Just step on it.
[26:11.01]Step on it.
[26:11.39]Step on it.
[26:14.18]Got it.
[26:19.24]TOS.
[26:19.38]What the fuck?
[26:20.22]TOS, dude.
[26:22.46]Yeah, that one sucks.
[26:26.36]20,000.
[26:26.72]Gold medal.
[26:28.76]I could pick up trash and make 60.
[26:32.98]Got another job for you.
[26:33.92]Something a little shadier.
[26:34.78]Okay, I just unlocked another.
[26:36.26]Assassin mission.
[26:39.74]Ugh.
[26:47.24]Uh, NoodleIsBadAtGaming is the one that had the dream.
[26:51.16]They said, hey Jeremy, glad I could make you laugh with that remark about my dream.
[26:54.18]Laughing my ass off.
[26:55.58]I must say it had me pretty fucked up in the morning.
[26:58.01]Happy New Year, I guess.
[26:59.55]I'm just happy that I was the one guy.
[27:01.05]Happy New Year, I guess.
[27:06.35]I mean, it was hilarious.
[27:07.63]That was like a really funny thing to read.
[27:10.27]It was just outrageous.
[27:13.87]The...
[27:18.68]I guess.
[27:23.28]Not eligible for funniest one-guy moment, unfortunately.
[27:26.86]Unfortunately.
[27:33.06]Kill as many as you can within time.
[27:34.38]Mission ends, so just kill as many as you can.
[27:38.32]3000 per kill?
[27:39.26]I'll try it.
[27:39.92]To the beach.
[27:47.67]A 2019 snub.
[27:57.96]You said how you're not gonna get this image out of your head until tomorrow.
[28:01.14]Try to imagine what it's like for them.
[28:03.32]They can't ever watch a Jerma stream the same way ever again.
[28:21.73]Ah, this community is fucking hilarious.
[28:26.16]Sometimes people think I'm like fucking, I'm like kidding around when I say that, or I'm like making it up.
[28:34.12]There's just like so many things.
[28:40.21]Your viewers are fucked.
[28:42.43]I don't know about that.
[28:51.08]Jeremiah, I have 7.5k points.
[28:53.06]Please wink.
[28:53.68]No, I'm sorry.
[28:54.50]That's not how it works.
[28:58.78]I was hoping to, like, GTA-style hit that and fly over into the beach.
[29:03.14]But there's an invisible wall.
[29:04.24]I'm an idiot.
[29:11.42]I have 12k.
[29:12.14]Can you wink for me?
[29:12.76]Does it cost 12k or does it cost 75k?
[29:14.26]Which one?
[29:23.26]He thinks this game is as good as GTA.
[29:31.34]Where's the entry here?
[29:32.72]Is it up?
[29:33.22]What?
[29:38.66]Will you wink at the 75,000 bit guy's wedding?
[29:46.56]I could have just... Alright, let's make some money.
[29:52.77]Let's make some fake money in-game.
[29:56.17]Kill as many as possible.
[29:57.47]Let's go.
[29:59.19]Don't you guys all have guns?
[30:07.97]Come on.
[30:10.79]Ah, my weapon's not good enough.
[30:23.93]Let's bring it together.
[30:24.93]Wasn't 3,000 per kill?
[30:26.63]Already better than looking at the mines.
[30:39.44]What Star Wars game is this?
[30:50.73]I don't know.
[30:54.47]We talked about that yesterday.
[31:01.53]Did I fight Holly Summers yet?
[31:03.58]I did.
[31:03.90]That's the last thing I did last night.
[31:06.34]Hey!
[31:23.25]Don't ever turn your back.
[31:24.75]Especially when you've got a gun.
[31:29.15]Two!
[31:30.21]Oh!
[31:31.63]The best thing in this game is when you get, like, seven people to stand in a row, and you do the sideswipe, and you fucking hit every single one in the head.
[31:43.90]It's so satisfying.
[31:57.24]I only have one person left?
[31:58.68]That's it.
[32:07.48]20?
[32:10.00]Nuts or chocolate?
[32:10.96]Nuts or chocolate?
[32:11.68]What do you mean nuts or chocolate?
[32:13.04]Why do I have to pick?
[32:13.74]That's a lot of money.
[32:18.17]Why do I have to pick?
[32:21.69]You have to pick.
[32:22.45]Um...
[32:28.46]I mean, nuts are healthier than chocolate, but I think chocolate's better than nuts.
[32:32.80]But you can't, you know what I mean?
[32:33.78]Like, I think chocolate is better than a nut, but nuts are healthier, so I'd rather eat nuts more than I would eat chocolate.
[32:52.99]What?
[32:57.89]What?
[32:59.33]What's wrong with that?
[33:05.61]No, all I'm saying is... All I'm saying is that chocolate is good.
[33:12.12]I like chocolate.
[33:13.48]I like to eat chocolate.
[33:16.36]But chocolate doesn't... You don't have to eat chocolate every single day.
[33:19.59]Okay?
[33:21.65]Nuts are healthy.
[33:23.99]But the thing about nuts is they can be a little salty.
[33:26.53]You know what I'm saying?
[33:27.99]Nuts can be too salty.
[33:30.42]Too much so that you don't want to eat them.
[33:32.06]Chocolate is sweeter.
[33:34.08]It's a little tastier.
[33:38.25]But, I don't know.
[33:39.43]It depends on actually... Some restaurants do it better than others.
[33:44.45]Chocolate from one restaurant versus chocolate from another restaurant.
[33:47.55]What I'm saying is, like what you like.
[33:52.30]I just fucking... I just fucking hit a pole.
[33:55.34]God damn it, guys!
[34:20.22]In my defense, I simply just looked up car crash sound.
[34:27.48]And I found this video, and it's like car crash.
[34:30.62]This thing's got fucking 1.6 million views.
[34:33.66]And I'm sitting there waiting for the car crash sound to play, and it took 24 seconds to go by.
[34:54.24]That sounded like a firework.
[35:01.43]Oh, shit.
[35:02.29]My Wii.
[35:09.59]No, not my center bar.
[35:16.92]I didn't have my strap.
[35:21.10]Fuck.
[35:21.98]Okay, let's go.
[35:22.82]Let's go.
[35:23.36]I have to play.
[35:34.68]I'm all twisted up right now.
[35:36.48]I'm twisted up.
[35:38.64]I'm him.
[35:39.10]I'm twisted up today.
[35:40.30]I'm very twisted.
[35:49.71]Let's get a new...
[36:01.12]Let's get some new sunglasses.
[36:05.41]Okay.
[36:09.25]Black?
[36:11.75]Pink?
[36:14.65]Pink, yeah.
[36:17.45]Get the Guy Fieri shades.
[36:24.18]We'll do pink.
[36:28.54]Guy Fieri doesn't have pink shades.
[36:35.32]Ooh.
[36:37.62]Ooh.
[36:38.51]I like that one.
[36:42.73]A cobra?
[36:43.63]No, that's a... It's a lion.
[36:45.67]That's a cobra.
[36:47.83]I mean, that's very clearly a lion, but look at that cobra face.
[36:50.05]This is too much money.
[37:07.14]Ooh, I actually like that look.
[37:09.48]Black and white?
[37:10.88]Black and white with the pink shades?
[37:13.28]I would wear this out.
[37:21.11]Wouldn't wear these out.
[37:28.40]Ooh!
[37:28.58]Ooh!
[37:38.44]This matches.
[37:42.47]But there's, boy, there's a hamburger one.
[37:50.75]What the fuck?
[37:55.79]I love chainsaws.
[37:57.75]You say psycho like it's a bad thing.
[37:59.73]Yep, that's the one.
[38:00.73]No, not yet.
[38:02.85]Give me that one.
[38:15.51]I gotta get the one that's hung up in every single college dormitory.
[38:19.40]Like on the wall.
[38:21.96]It's like beer cans and shit all over the place.
[38:24.70]Oh, yeah.
[38:25.30]What's that on the wall?
[38:26.00]What's that plaque over there?
[38:26.96]Alright, let's go.
[38:34.19]Matches the shades.
[38:37.77]What about jeans?
[38:38.31]New pants?
[38:43.90]Hmm.
[38:53.52]Now, where are the black jeans?
[38:58.93]Right there.
[39:04.29]I love a good pair of black jeans.
[39:05.41]They go with everything.
[39:11.17]I'll keep my... No, these ones are ugly.
[39:14.43]I'm spending all my money.
[39:15.63]No.
[39:16.73]Actually, I don't like these jeans.
[39:17.64]Get them off.
[39:25.44]I mean, this looks bad, but who cares?
[39:26.86]Uh... Alright, that's... I do like the Rocket Popsicle.
[39:45.24]What is it?
[39:45.58]Is it America or Popsicle?
[39:48.98]By the way, you can't... Where do you get those now?
[39:50.66]You can't buy those anymore.
[39:51.58]Hmm.
[39:54.93]Colgate.
[39:55.91]No, I see rocket popsicle.
[39:57.33]Yeah, Colgate too.
[39:59.74]Yeah.
[40:08.70]These are at the dollar store.
[40:13.53]Wow, you're a clown.
[40:16.67]Let's get a good look.
[40:24.39]It's not bad.
[40:27.89]Although I just spent all my money.
[40:30.09]Let's do another assassin mission.
[40:32.13]No, let me see if I can do some of these, because, look, I can do some of these free missions.
[40:37.69]Wait, don't get hit.
[40:40.13]Go to the beer icon.
[40:42.35]You got it.
[40:42.75]Dude, is Jerma one of those people that looks at chat?
[40:49.50]You got it.
[40:49.90]I'm going in right now.
[41:01.20]I think I do have seven.
[41:08.46]Aha!
[41:09.40]A ball!
[41:10.34]In return, let me teach you something.
[41:12.04]Select the technique that you want.
[41:15.73]Ooh.
[41:16.41]Memory of three.
[41:17.31]Displays the position of enemies on the mini-map.
[41:21.87]That's pretty good.
[41:24.59]Allows a jumping slash.
[41:27.98]to be performed by shaking the nunchuck.
[41:33.67]Also pretty good.
[41:38.71]Allow a dash to be performed by pressing the B button.
[41:47.16]I think I want that one.
[41:54.40]memory of woman extends dark side mode time limit alright that's not bad but I these are all increases the range of your grab that's good too earn bonuses based on your rank what does that mean allows a jumping down attack I'm gonna do the dash
[42:23.65]This one.
[42:24.21]I can dash with B?
[42:25.79]I feel like that's like a Bloodborne dash, right?
[42:28.45]Technically.
[42:30.15]Or is it a sprint?
[42:31.88]We'll find out.
[42:35.68]Learn the technique of Bzar.
[42:47.53]You got that?
[42:49.53]Come back.
[42:54.42]I'm really tired of the pre-recorded streams lately, honestly.
[42:56.24]I mean, I appreciate the effort, but it's just sad.
[42:59.52]I'm really tired of all the pre-recorded streams lately.
[43:01.29]I mean, I appreciate the effort, but it's just sad.
[43:13.42]Planted message.
[43:20.20]Alright, time for a... Where is it?
[43:21.34]Where is it?
[43:21.76]Where is it?
[43:22.63]Let's do... this... one?
[43:28.95]Literally no one said that.
[43:30.09]Yes they did!
[43:31.65]Look at the logs.
[43:44.68]Let me take a look at this list.
[43:50.86]Which one of these haven't I done?
[43:52.76]Bronze on this one, but it's only 30k, so... Silver, silver, gold, nothing.
[44:02.24]In the time limit, okay.
[44:04.99]90,000, kill 100 enemies, mission... Hmm.
[44:09.83]How long will this take, though?
[44:10.99]I feel like this is going to take too long.
[44:15.87]Going to bat... I'll do this one.
[44:17.19]5,500 for kill.
[44:27.49]I'm here for the VOD chat?
[44:29.93]Didn't they get rid of that?
[44:31.21]Doesn't that not exist anymore?
[44:43.76]Doesn't.
[44:49.62]The thing about VOD chat though is, what's... Why would they get rid of it?
[44:57.39]I mean... I get... was it... were they trying to, like, save data or something?
[45:09.43]Why would you have it?
[45:11.80]Yeah, I mean, I guess it's one of those things where it's... it's just... There's no reason to get rid of it, and there's no reason to have it.
[45:19.38]Right?
[45:21.02]It's weird.
[45:27.32]CoreMonster just came in with another huge money drop here.
[45:30.28]CoreMonster, I have to hunt 10,000 bits from CoreMonster.
[45:38.19]Another hundred fucking dollars.
[45:42.01]In bits, 10,000 drop.
[45:44.99]On top of the other stuff.
[45:47.54]Thank you, CoreMonster, for your insane contributions.
[45:50.46]It's true that this is a pre-recorded stream, because these are pre-recorded bits.
[45:56.56]Now that would be very interesting.
[46:00.06]That would be very interesting.
[46:06.24]How did I miss that?
[46:07.60]Fuck, I don't want to mess this up.
[46:09.10]I have to get away.
[46:14.74]One more, one more, one more, one more.
[46:16.22]Give me, give me, give me one more.
[46:27.84]Pre-recorded stream, pre-recorded bits.
[46:31.26]How would you pre-record bits?
[46:32.52]You would have to sit here.
[46:33.96]That would be really hard to do.
[46:36.07]Because you would have to sit here the whole time.
[46:39.95]And then wait for this exact moment where I'm about to address your bits.
[46:46.83]And time it correctly so I don't do it too early or too late.
[46:51.51]Hmm.
[46:54.23]That would be interesting.
[46:57.61]What do I got for money?
[46:58.59]330?
[46:58.61]I need... We'll do... We'll do one more trash pickup.
[47:02.33]Or I'll try to get one of the... You are late in addressing bits half the time.
[47:12.83]Still have to get it close.
[47:17.87]Look at that one.
[47:29.44]LOL, he killed that guy.
[47:40.63]Don't take a single hit!
[47:42.03]This one's hard because you have this one area and there's a shitload of people.
[47:44.51]You just have to... You gotta get kind of lucky, actually.
[47:47.55]Let's try this.
[47:48.33]I'm gonna go for this.
[47:50.11]Oh!
[48:00.96]I don't have any battery.
[48:04.32]How am I gonna do this?
[48:08.47]I don't have any battery.
[48:28.91]The dash?
[48:33.74]Oh, it is a run.
[48:34.88]It's a sprint.
[48:36.78]Oh, it's a sprint.
[48:38.04]It's a sprint.
[48:39.06]It's a sprint.
[48:40.32]It's a sprint.
[48:41.94]It's a sprint.
[48:44.30]I thought it was like a... Like a dodge.
[48:49.40]Like a better dodge.
[48:50.04]It's a sprint.
[49:05.83]Alright, gold.
[49:07.95]Gold?
[49:08.59]Gold.
[49:09.13]I got gold on everything.
[49:10.03]What is the most money?
[49:11.59]Pawn for pawn?
[49:13.13]Probably garbage, right?
[49:14.79]And plus I can sprint.
[49:16.51]Yeah, we can do garbage collector.
[49:23.43]Super Frog.
[49:24.03]How can you not like it?
[49:27.78]Don't forget the new sword, too.
[49:29.04]Yeah, I know.
[49:30.02]And I have to train.
[49:30.98]There's a lot to do.
[49:35.58]I don't even need the motorcycle anymore, do I?
[49:38.04]Is this as fast as the motorcycle?
[49:49.58]It might be.
[49:50.86]The bike is faster?
[49:51.78]Alright.
[49:56.86]Yeah, it is.
[50:02.63]When am I going to get Jarvis Superbomb?
[50:07.16]There already is Jerma's Super Frog.
[50:12.24]It's a BTTV emote.
[50:21.92]I know that song by heart.
[50:41.85]Why is the bike so big?
[50:42.99]It kinda just is.
[50:51.32]This actually might go smoother.
[50:53.24]Can I sprint with the thing on my back?
[50:54.96]Find out.
[50:58.48]Jeremy uses BTTV on demotes because he hates mobile viewers.
[51:02.50]That's not true.
[51:04.96]Wow, this is gonna be great.
[51:06.08]I should be able to get like at least 60 here.
[51:31.13]I hate mobile viewers.
[51:44.82]Which way?
[51:46.50]Bad route.
[51:50.30]You're playing Death Stranding.
[51:55.21]Not quite.
[52:08.95]You know, it would be kind of interesting, you know, everyone makes like, oh, it's a Strand type game.
[52:13.75]That's like the joke, right?
[52:14.89]It's the Strand game.
[52:16.44]But imagine if there was a game like GTA, where if you ate anything, if you actually just made trash, it would be way worse than this.
[52:27.98]The streets would be made out of trash.
[52:33.84]If you like ate food in a game like GTA, let's say you need to eat to live.
[52:41.94]And every time you ate something, it just got thrown on the ground.
[52:48.55]That went into everybody else's game.
[52:52.46]They would be people specifically eating just to make sure there was trash on the ground.
[53:08.92]I wonder what an experiment would look like if you actually had a game whose sole purpose was built around people making trash and people cleaning up the trash.
[53:18.48]And you got to pick which one you wanted to do.
[53:30.25]That would be insane, right?
[53:31.49]Easy.
[53:44.99]I'd pick up the trash.
[53:47.59]And make picking up the trash way more difficult than just throwing it on the ground.
[54:01.17]Get to 50, please.
[54:03.41]Even with the sprint, not even good.
[54:12.87]Yeah, and when you pick up the trash, you get... I don't know, if you pick up a hundred pieces... If you get like a hundred canes, you get a new skin.
[54:23.15]Or if you deliver a hundred bags of trash, you get... You unlock like skins and stuff.
[54:42.57]Alright, I'm going for this one right here.
[54:52.72]Dude, the game could just be called Town Cleanup.
[54:57.00]I wonder how many different Discord groups would appear to try to systematically put as much trash down as humanly possible, and how many others would be trying to do against it.
[55:11.23]Go the other way.
[55:19.29]kill him visceral cleanup detail yeah like visceral cleanup detail but it's not a lot
[55:41.99]Holy shit, I almost got hit.
[55:44.49]What the fuck was that lock on?
[55:47.03]What was that lock on?
[55:48.07]I tried to change the lock on and I got whacked.
[55:53.25]Yeah, but imagine that would be... I actually... I'm a weirdo, okay?
[55:59.16]I would really think that game was fun.
[56:01.80]I love House Flipper.
[56:03.56]I love viscera cleanup detail.
[56:05.58]I think a lot of people severely underestimate just how much people like to tidy shit up in games.
[56:14.03]Or even if it was only cleaning up and rebuilding.
[56:22.34]I'm a weirdo.
[56:22.96]I'm weird.
[56:23.92]See this hat?
[56:24.68]It's weird.
[56:25.86]What does that mean?
[56:27.19]What does it say?
[56:27.69]See this hat?
[56:44.03]I have enough money, let's go.
[56:45.25]No!
[56:45.55]I need to go to the, uh... Another big bit drop!
[56:58.06]It's a money stream.
[56:59.00]I'm gonna play No More Heroes every day.
[57:01.22]Money streams.
[57:03.00]Filactory.
[57:05.04]Who is one of our resident trillionaires.
[57:08.91]Uh, gave another 5,000 bits.
[57:14.37]Cranberry chocolate sundae, fuckhead.
[57:18.55]Is that like your favorite sundae?
[57:24.17]Cran- Cranberry chocolate sundae, fuckhead.
[57:28.19]I don't- oh, is that like what he- is that what he says?
[57:35.04]It's from this- oh yeah.
[57:36.46]Cranberry chocolate sundae!
[57:41.48]Fuckhead!
[57:45.39]Listening to screaming sound effects and people diarrhea-ing sounds.
[57:48.45]Diarrhea-ing is really normal.
[57:51.21]I didn't say that I was normal.
[58:01.84]You know what, guys?
[58:02.60]I am pretty normal.
[58:04.88]I'm pretty fucking normal.
[58:08.40]I do my chores, I do errands.
[58:12.63]I go to sleep, I wake up, I do my taxes, I fill up my gas, I drive around, I take care of... I'm a pretty normal goddamn person.
[58:31.17]I eat and I go, oh, that was good.
[58:34.11]This is a good steak and cheese sandwich.
[58:39.05]I'm pretty normal.
[58:50.63]You suck at acting, mobile.
[58:59.27]What a boring life.
[59:01.41]No, you can have a normal life and not have a boring life?
[59:06.38]What?
[59:10.74]Oh, that's right.
[59:11.14]I did say that I did call a changer beeper last night and people wanted to literally murder me.
[59:31.23]You're right, I did.
[59:31.93]I know, because I saw it a million times.
[59:46.02]Strength increased.
[59:46.64]Good.
[59:47.98]Let's do the stamina.
[59:50.86]Squatch.
[59:56.04]Look at this ring.
[59:56.56]What is it?
[59:57.14]What is this?
[59:57.84]Colgate ring?
[59:59.20]Right, everybody?
[60:01.82]Red, white, and blue lines, everything.
[60:03.12]It's Colgate, right?
[60:16.52]When I say it, it's not funny, but when you say it, it's funny.
[60:20.42]What's going on there?
[60:21.58]What's up with that?
[60:22.96]What's up with that?
[60:32.71]Explain this normalcy.
[60:36.04]Hold on, wait, I can't, it's going too fast.
[61:26.06]You gotta have context with that image.
[61:27.66]You can't just be like, look, hey, look.
[61:31.04]Okay, that is a pretty normal occurrence.
[61:33.08]But if there's context behind what that image is...
[61:38.61]Did a livestream based around being slimed Nickelodeon-style by your audience.
[61:45.15]And one of the games was trying to get the audience to say things that they... Maybe they would say... You guys say diaper all the time, so I put on a diaper to try to force everybody to say diaper, and it worked.
[61:57.74]Is that... Is that so weird?
[61:59.44]Is that so abnormal?
[62:11.53]It's very abnormal.
[62:12.67]Well... Alright, I gotta... How much is the new, uh... The new prototype?
[62:32.88]I hate absolutely everything about this game.
[62:34.99]This challenge is yesterday streamed for worst of the decade.
[62:41.45]This game is really fun.
[62:43.81]What are you on about?
[62:48.47]This game is... This is a very... I like this game a lot.
[62:53.01]This is a very, very fun game.
[63:10.11]And the second one's good too.
[63:18.91]Let's be real here, all the most famous people in history were weird, really fucking weird people.
[63:29.33]Shit, it's ready.
[63:29.99]I need 148,000 dollars.
[63:31.41]I need it.
[63:42.05]I need that.
[63:49.60]How much is it?
[63:50.05]140?
[63:50.07]Do I have...
[63:54.14]25,000.
[63:54.50]Alright, if I do a couple more kill missions, and do them right and not lose, then I'll get it.
[64:00.65]I've done my strength training.
[64:01.71]I've done my new techniques.
[64:06.55]I gotta make money.
[64:07.87]I need to make $120,000, $130,000.
[64:09.35]Let's go.
[64:09.67]Do coconuts.
[64:10.15]I'm not doing coconuts.
[64:15.76]Coconuts is pound for pound the worst.
[64:25.78]What should I do?
[64:26.70]Let's go to the assassin.
[64:28.74]Kill 100 people?
[64:29.38]Yeah, I'll do that one.
[64:30.89]Let's see how quickly I can get through that one.
[64:33.29]Ooh, there's a new one.
[64:57.76]Pizza Butt the finale.
[64:59.94]Chain restaurant Pizza Butt plans to open up.
[65:03.36]That's 75,000.
[65:04.14]I did another huge bit message just come in.
[65:16.59]Another huge one.
[65:18.09]Another 5,000 bit drop right now from Snoozing Copter.
[65:27.53]Holy shit, Susan. 5,050.
[65:33.24]I'm sorry, I'm not looking at the game right now.
[65:37.70]They say, you know, at first I was going to have this message be dedicated to make you play God Hand.
[65:42.62]And I was really angry in that message because you like this game so much with it being so similar to God Hand, and we all know you would like God Hand if you would give it a real chance and learn the controls.
[65:53.62]But then you said some nice things about us, the community, so I rewrote this message.
[65:59.41]But for real, play God Hand.
[66:00.86]I'll explain why in the AfterStream hangout.
[66:03.00]Hey chat, God Hand, rise up.
[66:07.86]I played God Hand for like 10 minutes?
[66:10.32]I still own it.
[66:19.85]Rise up?
[66:20.45]Is this like a play it for real, like do it for real?
[66:22.81]Did I hate it?
[66:23.35]Did I just not get it?
[66:25.34]Did I like not give it the real chance it was supposed to have?
[66:31.19]Play it for more than 10 minutes.
[66:36.50]Does anybody have a clip of me playing it?
[66:40.34]I didn't remember.
[66:44.11]He hated it.
[66:47.67]You said you played it for 10 minutes.
[66:48.79]Of course that's not a real chance.
[66:56.86]You didn't beat the tutorial because you couldn't get used to the controls in five minutes.
[67:01.84]God Hand is garbage, to be honest.
[67:03.32]You didn't beat the tutorial.
[67:14.62]When is, um... I gotta get this off.
[67:18.70]I just looked over my other monitor and full screen is this image.
[67:22.00]Get that out of here.
[67:26.02]Alright, let's get Pizza Butt.
[67:27.46]When does the Cuphead DLC come out?
[67:29.86]I feel like they announced it a year ago.
[67:31.52]When is it?
[67:33.02]When do we get to get that?
[67:34.46]This is actually going to be pretty tough.
[67:42.53]They all have lightsabers.
[67:43.35]Holy shit.
[67:45.11]What are you doing?
[67:49.03]I'm trying to run.
[67:53.39]I can't run.
[67:54.43]I can't run, guys.
[67:58.08]You're just stopping me.
[68:01.72]I can't get up to- get- Oh my god.
[68:10.51]What is this?
[68:13.59]No!
[68:13.87]Scared now?
[68:16.37]Um...
[68:26.15]Well, that's why it's the finale
[68:50.55]I saw this streamer last night at Chuck E. Cheese demanding bits from the kids when he won the games.
[68:54.77]He had a rat-like grin.
[68:55.99]Oh, okay.
[68:59.81]God Hand VI- No, let me beat this first.
[69:01.44]I need money.
[69:01.96]This sprint doesn't work!
[69:19.26]I can't go that way.
[69:19.86]This sprint doesn't work.
[69:20.59]I got baited by my own chat telling me to be baited by me.
[69:25.05]You can't sprint.
[69:32.75]You can't sprint and fight.
[69:34.29]It's out of combat sprint only.
[69:35.48]Alright, give me this one.
[69:45.14]God damn it.
[69:47.70]We told you that.
[69:49.49]Who told me that?
[69:52.21]Crazy animal.
[69:53.33]Alright, time to win.
[70:02.12]Anybody else?
[70:17.41]I can't even sprint here.
[70:18.33]It's truly absolute out of combat.
[70:19.89]Only out in the outside world?
[70:22.77]Dude, you have no health.
[70:49.49]That's the bad thing to do when somebody's right behind you!
[70:52.33]What?!
[70:54.85]I thought he was taunting!
[71:12.92]I thought he was taunting.
[71:14.16]I thought he was fucking taunting.
[71:15.48]He put his hands up like, yeah!
[71:18.17]I'm boiling.
[71:18.97]I haven't been able to do one of these in like three in-game hours.
[71:22.79]I mean, what's with the yelling I just did?
[71:27.76]He said that he was taunting!
[71:29.18]I thought you'd relax.
[71:53.76]If I had anything to say to you, it would be this exact message.
[71:57.97]You're the guy that gave me less chicken than one chicken wing last night at Arby's, right?
[72:02.93]You said your name was Jeremy something.
[72:04.39]Never got to the last name.
[72:05.97]Let me just say, on behalf of the chat, could you please make an Arby's chicken wing on stream and stop slacking off at work?
[72:11.11]Thanks.
[72:11.99]Mr. Jeremy Arby's.
[72:22.77]I'm going to kill that Sea Heel.
[72:27.01]The taunting!
[72:33.70]Real voice.
[72:49.03]Why is everyone suddenly talking about that shitty God Hand game?
[72:52.33]I would hold up.
[72:54.15]After you say that, please go into the giant safe.
[72:56.67]That's like a... You have to close yourself in that safe, because you're about to get rained on.
[73:01.06]People are going to rain rocks and fucking objects at you and stuff.
[73:05.48]Put your shield up.
[73:06.38]I'm serious.
[73:09.87]May you find your overpowering...
[73:15.19]Spam B. I can't take it anymore.
[73:18.01]I just did.
[73:28.45]That's cool.
[73:30.44]I played this game a lot of times.
[73:31.62]I didn't know that was possible.
[73:44.99]Are you having fun?
[73:45.81]Yeah?
[73:48.05]It just sucks when somebody is taunting and you get hit and you lose the one-hit mission.
[73:58.52]Alright, let's go.
[74:02.40]CEO.
[74:04.02]I gotta make this count.
[74:13.45]Every single person you have to just I have to get in there and kill somebody I gotta get in there and kill somebody somebody's like right in the front row immediately I'm going for the not greed.
[74:23.33]I'm just gonna go in try to go up.
[74:24.71]Let's go Uh, I just have to get in there and get a a swipe on someone There it is
[74:41.81]What is that?
[75:30.43]Kill him!
[75:30.67]He's on the ground!
[75:31.91]He's on the ground!
[75:33.05]Get!
[76:08.82]And I'm not doing the extra swing.
[76:10.28]Alright, slow down.
[76:14.09]Ton ting.
[76:14.81]I was going to fill up gas.
[76:20.51]That went so easy.
[76:22.75]Oh, baby Jerma going to quit that mission like he quit God Hand?
[76:28.48]Spam B?
[76:28.94]I can't fucking take it anymore.
[76:36.62]Another day, another crash joke.
[76:37.98]Nah, I just figured crashing into the wall was easy to get off the bike instantly.
[76:41.64]I'm just walking into the thing.
[76:57.31]This is a good stream.
[76:58.11]I'm happy.
[76:58.61]Well, I'm glad you're happy.
[76:59.59]Is it almost New Year's?
[77:02.17]In, um... What is it?
[77:09.73]When's the New Year's?
[77:11.25]In like six hours?
[77:17.68]Tong... Tong... Tonga.
[77:20.00]Tonga?
[77:21.70]What's the country that gets the New Year's first?
[77:23.68]Three, two, one.
[77:45.30]This is the second time I've done this and I'm just realizing that the nozzle's not connected to anything.
[77:54.88]I'm holding just a big grill lighter.
[78:05.85]It's wireless.
[78:08.43]It's a Bluetooth device.
[78:11.59]Tesla portable battery charging.
[78:18.31]You still have time to make the worst voice of the decade.
[78:22.57]I'm not even sure I could do that if I tried.
[78:24.39]It would end up being just a weird mix of me trying to sound horrible and terrible and loud and... I think I've probably unintentionally done worse ones without trying.
[78:51.62]Can't talk... What?
[78:53.86]No, I'm not... I don't get opinions on what's... Until tomorrow afternoon, you're not going to know my opinion on any of these categories.
[79:12.90]You'll get my opinion on them, absolutely, but not until tomorrow night.
[79:16.76]By the way, the nominees are there.
[79:20.44]Ow.
[79:34.38]I want to vote on that, but I don't want to watch a bunch of clips.
[79:38.48]Okay, I have to fucking finish this.
[79:45.96]Am I subbed?
[79:46.60]Ah, doesn't look like it.
[79:55.67]20's good.
[80:09.05]So you're not supposed to use your cell phone at a gas pump, right?
[80:12.89]Is that like a weird myth or is that true?
[80:21.41]Is it true?
[80:22.39]Is it false?
[80:25.13]I've heard conflicting data on if you should use your cell phone at the... It's an old myth?
[80:37.94]It could cause a spark.
[80:42.67]Did you get that from Facebook?
[80:43.91]No.
[80:50.04]You've confused gas stations and airplanes.
[80:51.98]No, look it up.
[80:53.40]Type in cell phone at gas pump and you're going to go, what?
[80:56.36]Really?
[81:05.81]What time is the New Year's Eve stream?
[81:07.38]The New Year's Eve stream is going to be... tomorrow.
[81:12.50]At... 6 p.m.
[81:17.10]Pacific time is when it's gonna start.
[81:18.84]It's gonna start around 9 p.m.
[81:20.78]Eastern.
[81:29.43]Tomorrow, yeah.
[81:30.11]New Year's Eve?
[81:33.25]That's so late.
[81:35.58]We have to count the ball down.
[81:38.72]That's the point of doing a New Year's Eve stream is so I can count down the ball.
[81:55.79]It's gonna be midnight Eastern is when we're gonna drop the ball.
[82:03.00]If you're going to stay up for New Year's Eve, do you... Well, it looks like it's 11.20.
[82:07.49]I think it's time to clock out.
[82:11.21]Happy New Year, everybody.
[82:12.89]Just text me when it turns 12.01.
[82:16.19]I think it's time for me to have a nice, relaxing day.
[82:18.85]I don't care.
[82:22.43]No, you stand around in a circle, and everyone's like, here we go, here it comes!
[82:29.05]10, 9, somebody gets to the front door.
[82:31.63]8, 7, somebody gets to the back door.
[82:34.15]7, 6, 5, 4, open the front door.
[82:38.39]To the outside.
[82:40.93]2, 1, let in the new year, open the back door, let the old year out.
[82:44.88]And then everyone's like, yeah, happy new year!
[82:57.01]Your family's weird.
[83:02.17]What?
[83:05.49]I think my family's fun, actually, now that I think about it.
[83:11.33]Your family's weird.
[83:13.44]We just silently sit in the chairs, and when the ball drops, we all silently clap three times.
[83:23.22]And then we all move to our designated sleep zones.
[83:42.26]Alright, I have to kill this fucking CEO.
[83:47.01]God!
[83:47.31]Here we go!
[84:09.49]This is fucking ridiculous.
[84:11.93]I can't do anything.
[84:15.11]Where is he?
[84:19.23]He's on the ground over here.
[84:20.85]Kill him!
[84:22.05]I got him!
[84:22.69]I did it.
[84:26.63]Alright, good.
[84:33.53]Fine, that's a lot of money.
[84:39.91]75,000, that's right.
[84:40.19]Alright, we have enough to get the new blade.
[84:42.41]What does BTTV stand for?
[85:09.68]Better twitch.tv.
[85:10.86]Better twitch.tv.
[85:15.78]Yeah.
[85:16.34]Better twitch.tv.
[85:43.43]Better Twitch taunting.
[85:45.11]Ow.
[85:45.37]Hey, don't lay a single finger on anything.
[85:49.01]Weapons.
[85:49.69]The Tsubaki MK2.
[85:52.19]Give it to me.
[86:10.26]Nice.
[86:11.36]Now, good.
[86:12.94]We got the new blade.
[86:15.14]There it is.
[86:15.60]Somebody said the F word, and we don't like... I was supposed to stop swearing this year.
[86:27.43]Yeah, this year I'm going to stop swearing.
[86:30.71]Can't make any promises for the next year, but this year I'm going to just take it back a little bit.
[86:41.15]Alright, I can... Let's go.
[86:42.97]I'm good to go.
[86:43.69]I got all my stuff upgraded.
[86:44.81]We can do Rank 5.
[86:47.43]You did this joke two years ago.
[86:48.89]Yeah.
[86:54.17]I'm sure I have.
[86:56.09]I'm sure I have.
[86:56.69]I've been recorded for like 4,000 hours.
[86:59.95]I'm probably going to repeat something sometimes.
[87:07.01]My voice has been recorded for like 600,000 hours.
[87:11.66]I'm gonna say the word the more than once.
[87:13.82]Let me guess, you're out shopping.
[87:16.31]Wrong!
[87:17.37]Woohoo!
[87:18.85]I am on vacation!
[87:20.23]Fiesta, baby!
[87:23.21]Shopping?
[87:23.93]Now a vacation?
[87:26.09]Ooh!
[87:26.57]Evita's amazing!
[87:28.25]Almost as amazing as me!
[87:30.27]A hard-working girl never forgets the office, even on vacation!
[87:34.89]Hey, I don't want to interrupt your fiesta.
[87:37.73]Who's next?
[87:39.87]Hey, give me a second.
[87:42.25]Don't go anywhere, sweet thing.
[87:45.67]What?
[87:47.19]Huh?
[87:47.93]Yo, what's the problem?
[87:49.41]Something wrong?
[87:50.52]Hello?
[87:51.66]Um, huh?
[87:53.54]I'm getting a bad connection.
[87:54.96]Hello?
[87:56.24]Can you hear me?
[87:57.24]Hello?
[88:01.56]Great.
[88:05.03]Woo!
[88:06.69]Shake it, baby!
[88:08.13]Oh, yeah!
[88:19.36]Let's go.
[88:22.46]No, I probably should have saved the game.
[88:25.16]I'll save the game.
[88:27.88]That won't happen on 5G.
[88:28.78]No, don't worry.
[88:33.24]That won't happen on 5 or 6G.
[88:36.02]Now, once I get to 6G, that won't ever be an issue again.
[88:38.42]You'll just... You know, you'll fold the phone up with your 17 fingers.
[88:59.60]Put your jeans back on?
[89:00.70]I like that.
[89:01.30]No.

[90:08.45]Wait, what the fuck is all over the... Why is there blood everywhere?
[90:14.24]I don't remember this.
[90:15.56]Why is there blood everywhere?
[90:32.45]I may have done that one.
[90:40.85]It's going to be just a trail.
[90:42.41]I lost the trail.
[90:43.03]Where is it?
[90:58.99]Yeah, it's definitely just all the way to the fight.
[91:09.78]Somebody's bleeding.
[91:10.69]Yeah.
[91:21.34]What happened here?
[91:25.72]Well, we'll find out very shortly.

[91:55.56]Who this?
[92:12.28]Ooh.
[92:13.36]Yeah.
[92:14.57]Ooh, it's beautiful.
[92:16.17]It's beautiful.
[92:22.77]It's a quad blade.
[92:30.15]Who are you?
[92:44.99]Ryan, I have to chase you down the hall.
[92:46.43]This one's a lot, this one's slower.
[93:00.97]It's not as quick as the last one.
[93:27.11]Oh, you caught me.
[93:28.35]Oh, just look at him.
[93:37.70]Oh my god, I walked into it.
[93:57.39]I like that one, that one's satisfying.
[94:02.56]Jerma, you gotta look, there's a link in the chat.
[94:11.06]No, hold on, I'm in the middle of playing No More Heroes.
[94:29.39]That big wind-up baseball swing feels so good.
[94:39.54]It's a high-quality link.
[94:40.70]Well, I'll see it very soon.
[94:48.11]Stop what you're doing, Jeremy.
[94:49.49]It's a spoiler.

[96:45.39]Anyone who posts that link is going to get a permanent ban.
[96:48.54]He's never going to beat this boss omega low.
[96:53.08]You'd think that.
[96:54.76]Jeremy, I thought you were good at this game.
[96:57.63]Alright.
[96:58.57]No more chat.
[96:59.73]No more chat for two minutes.
[97:23.69]No, I didn't mean literally.
[97:25.19]I just meant figuratively.
[97:28.13]Figuratively.
[97:29.69]Figuratively.
[97:31.39]Figuratively.
[97:32.43]Am I saying that figuratively?
[97:35.15]Figuratively?
[97:37.92]Is it figuratively?
[97:40.22]Figuratively?
[97:41.58]Figuratively.
[97:42.84]Why can I not say that word?
[97:44.78]It's weird now.
[97:45.80]Figuratively.
[97:49.62]Figuratively speaking.
[97:51.48]Figuratively speaking.
[97:57.85]I wasn't an English major.
[97:59.59]I was a pottery miner.
[98:04.65]And I majored in sailboats.
[98:28.68]Pottery.
[98:31.46]Alright, almost at the end of the hallway.
[98:32.68]Finally.
[98:33.20]Imagine not knowing how to speak your native language.
[98:39.98]No, it just... English major.
[98:45.45]No, I'm a fucking goddamn... What does it matter?
[98:50.27]The fifth rank awaits you if you win.
[98:57.46]And only eternal damnation awaits if you lose.
[99:01.57]How are you feeling?
[99:03.09]No irritable rashes?
[99:04.81]Hit the John lately?
[99:06.89]Taken care of the blackheads on your nose?
[99:09.65]Might I recommend a good hygiene set?
[99:12.90]When you're ready, step inside.
[99:15.56]Now, don't tense up too much on this one.
[99:18.16]You've been slacking off a bit.
[99:20.10]You must maintain a steady tempo.
[99:23.00]Stop attacking him?
[99:24.32]Oui, you know what I mean, right?
[99:27.19]I am so sorry to say this, but I am 1,800% positive that you will die here.
[99:33.71]But trust your force and head for the Garden of Madness.
[99:40.60]Okay.
[99:42.92]You say psycho.
[99:45.50]I say look at me.
[99:48.34]Yes.
[99:50.21]Yes.
[99:51.47]Yes.
[99:57.20]Content, content, here it comes.
[100:00.08]Here comes the big content part of the game.
[100:11.55]There it was.
[100:11.89]Okay, let's go further.
[100:27.24]to the ice cream.
[100:29.72]Alright.
[100:30.86]I really for some reason thought that was a pixel person holding with their arm with a very baggy sleeve a popsicle.
[100:38.56]I don't know why, but that's what it was.
[100:57.00]Isn't this a Bugs Bunny cartoon?
[101:00.18]Where all of a sudden the hand starts coming down and drawing, and he's like, ah, get away from me!
[101:05.05]Right?
[101:05.31]Doesn't that happen?
[101:08.45]Daffy Duck?
[101:16.30]It was in one of them.
[101:18.26]It's Daffy, yeah, Daffy Duck.
[101:27.18]At last.
[101:28.24]Doctor, it's time.
[101:30.08]Wake up!
[101:37.79]Oh yeah, you look good, Undulation.
[101:40.47]Your rumbling is excellent.
[101:42.33]I think I'm going to lose the bowel control.
[101:45.17]It's Klaus from American Dead.
[101:46.58]Are you the fifth-ranked guy?
[101:48.48]Yeah, I've been waiting for you.
[101:51.66]You certainly sound like you're up for a fight.
[101:55.73]I'm ready whenever you are.
[101:58.74]Alright then, here I come.

[104:22.05]After you.
[104:29.42]I did it.
[104:30.18]I win.
[104:32.06]Did I fuck up that last thing?
[104:36.75]I think I fucked it up a little bit.
[104:37.87]Hold on.
[104:39.67]Let me fix it.
[104:40.37]I fucked it up, I fucked it up, I fucked it up, I fucked it up.
[104:42.41]Alright, we're good.
[104:50.50]Stop right there!
[104:51.92]The fight is over!
[104:54.70]Travis, you are now ranked fifth.
[104:56.78]But we haven't even... We're just getting started!
[105:00.63]Perhaps you've forgotten.
[105:01.73]These fights are an official game.
[105:03.55]If your opponent dies for whatever reason, according to the rules of conduct, it is... Yeah, oh, no, I remember this.
[105:08.62]That's right.
[105:09.04]That's fucked up!
[105:09.90]That's the stupidest rule I've ever heard!
[105:12.16]This guy's mine, and you just want me to let him go?
[105:14.90]Bitch!
[105:18.84]Rules are rules.
[105:20.06]You can't have what you can't have.
[105:22.33]Whatever.
[105:23.39]But this dude says he wants to fight, and ain't nobody gonna stop him.
[105:27.03]This ass-clown right here is... Who?
[105:31.87]This guy really lives by his t-shirt quote.
[105:34.73]Marvelous!
[105:35.09]I did it!
[106:09.64]Let's shake.
[106:17.45]You know, at some point, they were probably programming that fight.
[106:21.43]And something kept going wrong, and they didn't want to give development time to figure out how they were going to fix it.
[106:26.24]So they were just like, fuck it, we've got four more fights to do.
[106:28.26]Just move on.
[106:33.96]Something was wrong there and they just like can it can it we got the model We have the model all done.
[106:38.74]Just let's do something fun with it This game had a six dollar budget that'd be pretty remarkable
[107:07.08]Your UAA registration is complete.
[107:09.74]As of today, you are officially the fifth ranked assassin in the United States.
[107:14.11]Nice work.
[107:14.99]You are on the fast track to the top.
[107:36.39]Yeah, I know, but like, if I own them, why can't I just see them?
[107:43.09]We don't, the TV, I'm just saying.
[107:43.99]$400,000 coming up.
[107:44.35]Let's do... $400,000.
[107:44.69]Let me go to the video store.
[108:05.64]A new part-time job is available.
[108:07.84]It sure is.
[108:10.10]You don't own them, you're renting them.
[108:12.76]Yeah, but... Is this still in the apartment?
[108:22.39]Is this the scorpion's one?
[108:35.87]How many mini-games are there?
[108:38.29]Eight?
[108:38.93]Nine?
[108:41.29]Cat.
[108:41.51]What about the cat?
[108:45.91]I'll go back later.
[108:48.57]There's plenty of time to pet the cat.
[108:50.71]I've got four more fights to do.
[109:04.63]Stop what you're doing and pet that cat.
[109:10.77]Dogs, cats, dogs, cats.
[109:14.22]Graffiti cleaning.
[109:15.24]Oh, nice.
[109:18.06]Erase graffiti from the walls.
[109:19.14]This is the game that I wanted to play.
[109:32.77]I probably would love Mario Sunshine.
[109:34.63]Holy shit, I'm just coming to this realization right now.
[109:36.99]I would love that game.
[109:38.05]It would be my favorite game ever.
[109:42.91]I love cleaning stuff.
[109:45.73]Why wouldn't I play that one?
[109:51.59]Any of the games that have cleaning as a main component of the game?
[109:59.66]It's the best Mario.
[110:04.44]Luigi's Mansion.
[110:05.32]I know, I can't play Luigi's Mansion.
[110:06.62]It takes over the weird part of my brain that gets addicted.
[110:10.05]And I can't even go in... Every single room, I have to clean everything.
[110:13.89]And it just fucks up the whole game.
[110:18.33]Chibi-Robo.
[110:20.13]Chibi-Robo.
[110:21.93]Yep.
[110:22.46]Alright.
[110:23.76]Go to the recommended channel.
[110:26.00]And put all these cleaning games in there.
[110:28.84]I crave them.
[110:35.43]Eternity is just around the corner.
[110:36.59]Your hard work can change this town.
[110:38.57]The future of Santa Destroy is a town without graffiti.
[110:42.08]Hard work will never betray you.
[110:43.38]Hard work will change your future.
[110:44.86]Kill the god of graffiti.
[110:46.12]Work harder than you've ever worked before.
[110:51.66]All these basics gotta sweep, sweep, sweep.
[110:56.61]Erase the graffiti sprayed around town.
[110:59.05]How?
[111:03.45]How, though?
[111:03.93]Like, just... I can't do that?
[111:19.62]I get it.
[111:19.94]Alright.
[111:20.98]That's a huge graffiti.
[111:22.08]Why can't I do that one?
[111:30.18]The technique here is just doing both at the same time.
[111:42.85]Why is Kravis so tired?
[111:44.17]I mean, I'm running around all over the place cleaning.
[111:53.34]Reverse jet-set radio?
[111:58.36]That's a sub-optimal route.
[112:00.06]It's okay.
[112:02.86]It's fine.
[112:03.50]And I just go... Come on.
[112:05.64]Where is it?
[112:09.18]Oh, right.
[112:09.48]I have stamina.
[112:13.82]Ow.
[112:14.05]I just hit him together.
[112:14.89]I just smacked him together.
[112:19.59]The vibrations just hurt my hands.
[112:27.02]Any baseball players or softball players in chat here?
[112:35.91]At all?
[112:38.50]Yeah, some.
[112:39.27]Remember when you used to get a big, a fastball would come down.
[112:43.41]And you'd get a nice big swing and it would hit either the very end or right on the hands of the bat.
[112:50.08]And it was the worst experience of your entire life.
[112:57.42]That was the worst.
[112:57.91]I hated that.
[112:59.03]More than anything.
[113:01.89]I would rather get hit by a pitch.
[113:04.54]Like, I would have rather a fastball hit me right in the shoulder than to have it hit me right on the hands of the bat and vibrate electrocute my whole body and hurt for like... No.
[113:15.93]I'd rather get hit with a pitch.
[113:23.97]Yeah, it rattles your actual hand bones and arm bones.
[113:28.79]And it feels like somebody took out your bones from your arms and stomped on them and put them back in.
[113:34.74]It's the worst.
[113:45.92]I did it?
[113:46.40]All of them?
[113:49.22]I actually did them all.
[113:49.88]I thought there were more than that.
[113:57.07]That's only 20,000.
[113:58.45]We're getting towards late game here, and you're gonna give me 20k for a job?
[114:06.54]New assassin job.
[114:10.12]You gotta do the assassinations?
[114:11.46]Yeah.
[114:12.16]But to unlock the assassinations, you gotta do these shitty little jobs, you know?
[114:16.28]The ones that give you 20k when you're almost at the late game.
[114:27.13]I was a catcher and got hit in between my leg and kneecap.
[114:29.97]I could never play again.
[114:33.08]Yeah, catchers, uh... Catchers are like the unsung hero of the whole game.
[114:38.68]It's a painful job.
[114:40.48]That shit hurts.
[114:43.08]Alright, pro wrestling contest.
[114:46.36]Only pro wrestling?
[114:47.44]5,000.
[114:47.76]As many as you can within the time limit.
[114:51.38]5,000.
[114:51.62]That's good.
[114:54.84]Batting spree.
[114:55.80]Let's do this one.
[114:56.50]Kill as many as you can.
[114:57.49]5,000 for a kill.
[115:00.13]In the underground.
[115:07.61]Shut the hell up, gamer!
[115:08.89]You're a gamer!
[115:11.83]Shut up, gamer!
[115:12.63]What are you talking about, shut up, gamer?
[115:16.47]Because I said the word sports?
[115:19.29]I said the word sports because I was talking about baseball and everyone's like, we're gamers here!
[115:22.95]Shut up!
[115:25.27]Shut up, gamer.
[115:27.31]What's going on?
[115:30.27]Oh, we just got raided.
[115:31.41]We just got raided by Joel.
[115:35.12]Oh, that's what's going on.
[115:36.22]Okay, alright, alright.
[115:37.14]Hey, what's up?
[115:39.00]What's going on, everybody?
[115:40.96]Playing No More Heroes.
[115:45.66]Welcome to the stream.
[115:46.40]Thanks for the raid, Joel.
[115:49.53]I was like, are these people, are they bots?
[115:51.78]I was like, what's going on?
[115:53.20]Because I did, I was just talking about sports and baseball and getting hit by pitches and stuff.
[115:57.14]And all of a sudden it's like, shut up, gamer, gamer.
[115:59.76]The gamer was capitalized.
[116:00.98]So it's like, oh shit, people are angry because I'm talking about like sports in the video game stream, right?
[116:11.94]Alright, I'm looking at chat.
[116:14.38]Yeah, welcome.
[116:17.02]Joel, when are we going to do no talking if everybody explodes?
[116:20.33]What's that game called?
[116:21.63]Keep talking and nobody will get hurt.
[116:24.17]Keep talking and nobody will explode.
[116:32.01]Keep talking and nobody explodes.
[116:39.12]Happy New Year, by the way.
[116:40.48]Is it New Year?
[116:41.08]No.
[116:41.22]You're not from New Zealand, right?
[116:58.97]Shut the hell up, gamer, or you'll explode.
[117:11.84]Mission star, here we go.
[117:17.50]Wouldn't it be funny if Travis broke his gamer bone when he crashed the bike?
[117:20.84]Haha.
[117:21.34]Yeah, it would be kind of funny, actually.
[117:29.67]Let's go!
[117:32.77]Run, run, run, run, run, run, run.
[117:33.95]Hurry, hurry, hurry.
[117:34.47]Open, open, open, open, open, open.
[117:35.69]Open the door, open the door.
[117:36.49]Go, go, go.
[117:38.04]Baseball!
[117:39.26]There it is.
[117:58.39]Dude, he said it.
[117:58.95]He said baseball.
[118:05.96]I'm gonna rack up some good money on this one.
[118:07.74]Actually, maybe not.
[118:12.87]Was it 5,000 per kill?
[118:15.27]Shit.
[118:29.22]This guy's still alive.
[118:38.32]Ooh.
[118:41.61]I don't like this one.
[118:42.65]This one's never... That's... This guy's $50,000.
[118:45.81]That's pretty good, actually.
[118:49.91]The other one's $90,000 to kill 100 people.
[118:53.12]I'll do that one.
[118:53.76]Let's go do that one.
[118:59.46]I actually have the new blade, so let me try to do one of the ones and not get hit.

[122:44.52]And I'm just gonna put a bi- I'm gonna write on a big piece of paper right outside.
[122:48.10]I'm gonna be like, oh, yo, Joel, I gotta go to the bathroom.
[122:50.20]I'll be right back.
[122:51.68]And then I'm gonna slap it on a fucking piece of paper on the window, and you have to- five minutes have gone by.
[122:56.76]You're like, wait, what are we doing out there?
[122:58.54]It's gonna be too late.
[122:59.70]Paper up there.

[123:04.16]LOL.
[123:04.94]And then I'm fucking crumpling the paper running.
[123:09.45]You know what, you're going to come catch me, you're going to get up and run?
[123:21.44]I'm not going to say that, it's going to be written.
[123:26.00]And I'm going to have the fucking mad, mean face, like...
[123:52.71]That was a ma- That was a- That was a SAD face, what are you talking about?
[123:58.37]No, that's the like- That's- That's the very silent- That's the silent but very clear, like, fuck you face, you know what I mean?
[124:18.80]Like... I have to play it.
[124:20.26]Wait, I can't- I can't look at the chat.
[124:26.68]Uh-oh.
[124:27.43]Is my sensor bar fucked up?
[124:30.11]What's going on?
[124:36.03]What happened?
[124:37.11]I just ran over something with my chair.
[124:42.80]You look like the kid that doesn't have a smile for picture day.
[124:45.92]I didn't.
[124:46.38]I never did.
[124:46.78]I hated that.
[124:48.52]I actually didn't like that.
[124:49.54]I thought it was annoying.
[125:07.71]I'm not gonna put that on stream.
[125:09.68]That's just weird.
[125:12.90]It's just a scary image.
[125:16.94]No, somebody has to Photoshop, like, my hand going.
[125:19.62]Here, I'll give you a Photoshop.
[125:21.54]Ready?
[125:22.92]Just... So I want, like, glass here.
[125:26.06]You know what I mean?
[125:26.84]Like, you can do, like, a filter to make it look like there's glass.
[125:29.46]And, like, just... Here's my hand.
[125:32.16]You can just, like, carve the arm and elbow out.
[125:36.62]You know what I'm saying?
[125:37.18]And then attach it to the face I made before.
[125:40.54]I guess I could just do this now, right?
[125:42.20]I could just do, like... Like... Like, I've got, like, a paper in my hand.
[126:03.32]Yeah, like, I'm pressing the paper up against the glass window.
[126:18.75]Dermot, you are so cringy.
[126:42.44]I fucking can't even do this shit anymore.
[126:52.67]How are you supposed to get a meat lover's pizza?
[126:57.32]Uh, not now.
[127:15.09]I was gonna do it on New Year's Eve.
[127:16.67]Yeah, not in a second.
[127:18.17]I'm doing, uh... No, long point sucks.

[127:44.02]That's not... It's not quite what I was looking for.
[127:56.58]No, I know.
[127:57.46]This image has been floating around for a long time.
[128:29.93]I'm not supposed to be holding a gun.
[128:33.67]Why do I have a gun?
[128:36.59]Why do I have a gun?

[129:45.27]Deep fake.

[131:47.57]What?
[131:47.75]No, but seriously, what does that have to do with anything?
[131:54.89]What does that have to do with anything?

[132:45.10]No, it's not.
[132:47.88]Oh, cool.

[133:22.13]This is me escaping from your iPhone.
[133:25.19]This is not what I was looking for.
[133:44.90]Turn it off, turn it off.
[133:45.91]I did.
[133:53.50]Here he comes.
[133:57.27]Oh god, he's getting out.
[133:58.37]Dude, that's not edited?
[134:08.73]What?
[134:09.00]Are you serious?
[134:24.72]What was it, 50 last time?
[134:26.82]I'll be close.
[134:27.36]Do I really have to eat a fucking meat lover's pizza tomorrow?
[134:34.93]I'm gonna get diarrhea.

[136:34.26]Do I have enough?
[136:36.24]330, I need 400.
[136:36.98]We'll do another assassin mission.
[136:40.74]The closest one I can find.
[136:45.89]Like this one over here.
[136:56.08]I know, it's a spinning gif.
[136:57.58]Yeah, I know.
[136:58.24]This... What is this?
[136:59.50]This is a different gun image.
[137:03.30]Where are... What are you... This is a different... What?
[137:17.27]I'm wearing a Death Stranding t-shirt?
[137:22.99]Oh, no.
[137:23.39]Death Star.
[137:26.79]Where are you guys getting these?
[137:46.01]Show the gif.
[137:46.97]I did the gif last night.
[137:49.63]I just showed the gif.
[137:51.55]There's two here now.
[137:54.75]Alright, let me try to get at least one of these done.
[138:10.05]Alright, let's do it.
[138:11.01]I have to do one of these.
[138:11.85]Got him there.
[138:23.11]All three of them will kill you.
[138:25.97]Good.
[138:26.23]Into the corner.
[138:41.87]Alright, let me get this one.
[138:45.71]Guy to the left.
[138:46.55]Watch the guy to the left.
[138:49.73]Ah!
[138:53.53]God damn it!
[138:55.35]These fucking missions are so hard!
[138:57.70]Fuck!
[139:01.90]It's so hard to... This weapon is so slow.
[139:04.66]God, I can't do these any... I can't do these.
[139:09.32]I did them in the...
[139:13.41]These missions are so painful.
[139:15.03]3... 2... 1... 0... Got guts!
[139:20.84]I'll give you that!
[139:24.10]What a pain!
[139:26.58]What a pain!
[140:14.39]The edit you've been waiting for.
[140:15.63]It's the edit you've been waiting for.
[140:16.89]That's... That's not even what... What is this?
[140:30.96]Is this from, like, a TV show?
[140:39.62]Hold on, I gotta... Here, hold on.
[140:48.59]Let's get it on here.
[140:49.25]Because I need to... I want to examine this photo real quick.
[141:05.14]Uh, there it is.
[141:06.04]I mean, that's not what I said I wanted to say.
[141:08.41]Is that, is that, is that the Jerm of fear face in the reflection?
[141:23.41]Did you add that?
[141:37.31]It's from Good Will Hunting, you swine.
[141:41.19]Yeah, alright.
[141:42.06]Sorry I don't remember every scene from every movie I've ever seen in my life.
[141:44.96]I haven't seen Good Will Hunting since it came out, like, 17 years ago.
[142:00.11]Just watch Good Will Hunting on stream now.
[142:04.27]Sure.
[142:07.11]Alright, let me please get one of these.
[142:09.77]Alright, watch, they're gonna run towards me.
[142:15.31]That guy's a cunt.
[142:36.80]I can't do these.
[142:38.22]I'm not doing them anymore.
[143:09.09]Why do I have Two Fingers?
[143:17.27]I have Two Fingers and a huge thumb.
[143:20.32]You're an alien.
[143:29.70]How much money do I have?
[143:31.51]Seriously, these one-hit missions.
[143:33.71]They're killing me.
[143:36.15]I even tried to block, too, and the guy, I thought he was reloading, whatever, I don't even need to explain it.
[143:43.83]This one's right here, I'm going to try this one more time, and then I'll never do these over again.
[143:58.67]This one sucks, because it's in a tiny little area.
[144:00.59]Just don't do a big charge attack, I have to get a good swing.
[144:06.70]Hey, he's over here.
[144:08.36]He's over here.
[144:14.93]There's somebody to my left.
[144:17.19]God damn, these are fucking awful.
[144:34.60]The guy in front of me hit me, I know, but I was trying to get away.
[144:39.84]I'm picking up trash again.
[144:52.43]Good luck paying that bill, fuckhead.
[144:57.99]Why am I frozen?
[145:11.75]It's really cold outside, and I don't have a jacket on or anything.
[145:27.73]I do like the icicles off my face.
[145:32.57]And I'm just sitting in my room too.
[145:41.78]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[145:43.23]No, no, no more photoshops.
[145:50.63]I can't need to show this one, because this is stupid.
[145:54.89]Okay, spoiler alert.
[145:56.73]Alright, if you've never seen any more, if you've never, if you've ever seen Infinity War, you'll think it's, if you've never seen Infinity War, I'm gonna close the stream for five minutes.
[146:19.36]I hate this, but I still, I hate this.
[146:37.44]It's a glass pane in Minecraft.
[146:40.71]It's a glass mine, that's awesome.
[146:50.66]I love it.
[146:51.56]I hate it, though.
[146:57.09]I'm not opening up any more Photoshop.
[147:11.38]Why'd you say five minutes?
[147:12.40]Because everyone for the next five minutes is gonna talk about Infinity Gauntlet stuff.
[147:33.46]It was two years ago.
[147:37.22]Yeah, and people got really mad at me when I started talking about... I've talked about movies that are 15 plus years old before, and people were like, dude, what the fuck, man?
[147:53.78]I actually think I talked about the ending of The Wizard of Oz, and somebody just wrote, dude, fuck you, I haven't seen that.
[148:04.66]I don't know how that's possible.
[148:12.68]If you've never seen The Wizard of Oz, then I don't... What am I supposed to tell you?
[148:18.64]That's like being angry if somebody's saying what Frankenstein is.
[148:22.75]Dude, Frankenstein is the doctor, and Frankenstein comes to life, and it's Frankenstein's monster.
[148:29.14]That's on the same level as me telling you that Dracula bites people and, like, sucks their blood and shit.
[148:34.62]What, does he?
[148:36.18]I've never seen any of that before.
[148:37.38]I was gonna watch Dracula 1.
[149:05.44]seen that.
[149:07.76]The Dracula book was better.
[149:20.71]But Marvel movies suck, though.
[149:22.86]I don't, I mean, I don't think so.
[149:30.86]I think some of them, I think some of them are pretty good.
[149:37.99]No, not yet, guys.
[149:38.85]Not yet.
[149:39.17]There hasn't been that one thing that happens in a Marvel movie that gets memed to death.
[149:44.86]And makes... Well, actually, hold on a minute here.
[149:46.54]Because that's how people start to hate something.
[149:48.82]It gets really, really popular.
[149:51.04]And then a bunch of people meme the fuck out of it to a point where nobody likes it anymore.
[149:56.89]I don't know if we're at that territory yet.
[149:59.37]People still like the Marvel memes.
[150:06.74]They did that with all of them.
[150:07.68]Yeah, but I'm not sure we've crossed that... Let's put it this way.
[150:12.18]I'm not sure we've crossed, like, the Szechuan sauce threshold for, like, I hate this TV show now.
[150:17.63]You know what I mean?
[150:27.49]There hasn't been that catalyst.
[150:39.06]Almost there?
[150:41.22]Almost.
[150:41.58]Pick it up!
[150:42.38]Run at the buzzer!
[150:56.56]Didn't get it.
[150:57.14]Sorry.
[150:57.62]50 grand.
[150:59.66]Look at all the thin ice, buddy.
[151:12.27]I only need... Not much more.
[151:14.79]I'm gonna actually do one of these... No, actually, hold on.
[151:18.68]I need... I didn't go to the gym yet.
[151:21.16]Alright, one more actual assassin mission, and then I'm going to the gym, so I can have enough money to be able to spend that money at the gym.
[151:36.40]One more assassin mission.
[151:47.24]We have enough money, LOL.
[151:51.28]I can't get over this Minecraft glass.
[151:54.60]Like, that's... That's funny.
[151:56.85]I love it.
[151:57.77]Alright, let's see.
[152:02.09]Stadium is seven.
[152:03.65]Which one haven't I done?
[152:05.57]Only wrestling moves?
[152:08.06]Hmm.
[152:11.21]If I can kill that CEO, that's a lot of money.
[152:13.43]Let me try the 100 one and see how fast I can do that.
[152:15.48]I haven't even done it once.
[152:19.08]It's $90,000 for 100.
[152:20.10]Let's time it.
[152:27.87]Pizza button.
[152:28.37]More like Pizza Hut.
[152:34.27]It depends on how many people are in the room.
[152:35.99]And if they have lightsabers or not.
[152:54.75]What's the worst thing on the menu at Pizza Hut?
[153:00.98]Oh, I know.
[153:02.64]Uh, the Cheez-It stuff.
[153:05.26]Yeah.
[153:05.84]The Cheez-It thing's terrible.
[153:08.86]Um... What's the best thing at Pizza Hut?
[153:13.41]Stuffed cross pizza?
[153:14.47]I already know.
[153:16.69]Get the spaghetti.
[153:17.27]Do they have spaghetti at Pizza Hut?
[153:25.99]The last few times I've had Pizza Hut, this is the worst part about Pizza Hut for me, at least personally.
[153:30.05]Um, I think that was a one-hitter.
[153:33.75]Pizza Hut always, to me, tastes highly different than Pizza Hut.
[153:37.92]This is awesome.
[153:39.18]I love it.
[153:40.24]But I think I've gotten sick the last two or three times I've had it.
[153:53.85]Oh shit This happens very, very quickly Fifteen?
[154:04.89]That's awful
[154:23.36]Most chain pizza places are awful, guys.
[154:29.55]We've had this conversation on stream before, already.
[154:33.13]I know that some people don't have opportunities to eat anything that's not something like a pizza.
[154:40.82]But they're all pretty bad.
[154:56.90]That's just kind of taking off my brain.
[154:59.18]This one's fine for 100,000, but I don't like this.
[155:04.51]I'm starting to see... I'm starting to get blurred vision from this one.
[155:19.81]Yeah, this actually hurts my head, so we're not doing this one again.
[155:33.49]40 pizzas in 40 days.
[155:39.24]Does this supersize me?
[155:53.42]Alright, I need a point.
[155:57.16]Parappa?
[155:57.90]Yeah, Parappa the Rapper ate 50, 40 pizzas in 30 days.
[156:22.09]That was pretty satisfying, but I don't like it that much.
[156:27.95]There's plenty of time.
[156:30.86]Ayayayayayayayayayayayayay
[156:45.66]These are all just dick dastardly ripping.
[156:49.12]Alright, we're done.
[156:52.75]Alright, let's never do this again.
[157:15.96]99?
[157:16.16]Where's 100?
[157:16.70]Yeah, let's not do this one ever again.
[157:30.01]Why is the spleen the body part that hurts the most for them?
[157:34.92]I don't know.
[157:35.42]Anybody have a timer for that?
[157:47.32]Alright, 488.
[157:48.09]Let's do the next.
[157:50.35]Rank 4?
[157:51.75]Rank 4 coming up, right?
[158:00.04]Seeing a lot of purple in the chat.
[158:32.46]It's so funny that those mailboxes are just one asset that I pasted down.
[158:44.60]ATM deposit $400,000.
[158:45.76]Well, maybe not yet.
[158:46.88]Did I do these yet?
[158:52.38]I don't think I did.
[159:09.16]You guys, I'll give you credit.
[159:17.01]You guys have been on point with the Photoshop links these last few days.
[159:24.21]But here's the thing.
[159:27.72]Is this... Don't read this.
[159:30.18]This is real voodoo.
[159:31.16]You are now cursed.
[159:32.26]The only way to reverse this curse is to eat an entire Domino's Meat Lovers Pizza on camera.
[159:37.00]There's like over 5,000 people here.
[159:39.89]I mean... Did I just curse everybody?
[159:43.89]Did I just curse everybody?
[159:45.63]You have to eat a pizza on camera.
[159:51.23]Sorry.
[159:59.44]You fool!
[160:04.02]I'm sorry.
[160:05.84]I had to show it so you guys could see what I was talking about.
[160:12.24]No, you have to eat 5,000 pizzas.
[160:31.01]I have an extended combo.
[160:37.21]Let's do... this is another bench press.
[160:42.89]Let's do it.
[160:49.44]Domino's is gonna have a spike in sales today.
[160:53.06]Papa John's pizza is actually the worst.
[160:58.22]Um...
[161:01.16]Yeah, it does suck, doesn't it?
[161:06.14]Out of all the chains, who has the best... Well, I know.
[161:08.50]That's simple.
[161:09.46]That would be Papagino's.
[161:14.42]But that Papagino's, I think, is a New England thing.
[161:19.45]So that's not technically a national chain, right?
[161:28.25]It's only a northeast thing, so I don't think that counts, does it?
[161:36.36]Papa John's.
[161:56.31]Chain pizza is strange because if you have a bad chain pizza, at least in my case, there's never a single solitary fucking reason to ever eat it again.
[162:10.64]I've eaten Papa John's probably twice, and it was 15 years ago.
[162:15.39]I was like, oh, this sucks.
[162:16.65]I don't like this.
[162:17.79]Oh, let me look around in a circle.
[162:19.51]There's like 700 pizza places around me.
[162:22.63]Why would I ever eat here ever again?
[162:25.46]Ever again.
[162:26.12]For any reason.
[162:33.40]But, if you don't have pizza places, like sandwich shops, pizza shops, all over the place, then I can understand why if Papa John's is all you got, then that's kind of all you got.
[162:42.44]Alright, where's that ATM?
[162:55.31]We have pizza places, but only the chain ones deliver.
[162:57.35]That's another key part of this, too.
[163:04.04]Is if a place doesn't deliver, you know, some... Sometimes you just want to just sit around and have somebody bring you something.
[163:17.27]I live in Sweden and their pizza sucks.
[163:25.15]Some of these places in New York and in Boston... New England, Northeast, East Coast pizza... is nowhere in the entire world, you can compare.
[163:40.94]You just can't.
[163:43.42]Connecticut, yep, Connecticut pizza is fucking awesome too.
[163:45.82]What about Italy?
[163:49.65]No.
[163:51.93]Ow!
[163:52.87]That hurt.
[164:05.25]New York, Connecticut, Boston, some places in New Jersey I've heard.
[164:10.79]I haven't had them, but they're some of the best pizza you can get in the whole world.
[164:17.69]I mean, pizza started in America.
[164:19.19]Alright, we got more videos.
[164:26.12]Oh, I have to buy these.
[164:31.38]There's another video.
[164:33.18]This title is Mask de Panther.
[164:36.94]Master of the Fourth Dimension.
[164:40.32]Yeah.
[164:46.56]How much money was that?
[164:48.26]Oh, right.
[164:48.70]That's because I already put the fee in, didn't I?
[164:51.66]Alright.
[164:51.96]I'll get these later.
[164:57.21]Alright.
[165:02.28]Boston pizza sucks.
[165:04.67]No, it does not.
[165:08.69]What are you talking about?
[165:14.25]It's on record by tons of people, huge food critics.
[165:20.02]The North End in Boston has some of the best pizza in the country.
[165:24.62]What?
[165:24.86]What are you talking about?
[165:27.20]Boston was voted worst pizza 2019.
[165:32.30]What, from like one of your friends in an Instagram story?
[165:34.91]What are you talking about?
[165:35.75]Oh, he's pissed.
[165:51.04]I just w- I just drove around in a circle.
[165:52.46]Hold on.
[165:58.96]Oh, fuck.
[166:04.08]Gyros are better than pizza.
[166:05.20]That's different.
[166:05.88]You can't say that.
[166:06.62]That's a completely different food.
[166:11.23]I love gyros.
[166:11.99]I'm obsessed with them.
[166:14.23]But saying that a gyro is better than a pizza, that's... Look, we have to have this conversation every time I say that word.
[166:30.02]People call it... I've heard Euro.
[166:33.86]I've heard Euro.
[166:34.96]I've heard Gyro.
[166:36.52]Gyro.
[166:37.78]Gyro.
[166:38.80]Euro.
[166:40.19]Every other place you call is different.
[166:42.29]Do I have to have this conversation again?
[166:52.55]Travis, the next rank is 4th.
[166:55.74]Who is it?
[166:56.88]I've come to think of it.
[166:58.30]Austin was ranked as having the worst tap water 16 years in a row.
[167:02.86]I'm not drinking out of my sink.
[167:04.58]It's okay.
[167:04.88]A show?
[167:05.14]Wait.
[167:05.30]This is a date, right?
[167:11.82]something like that why else would I be getting an oil rub what what did you say someone's rubbing you down Boston has the worst pizza that's no it doesn't later what are you talking about give me this look I'm gonna click your absolute debate link and let's see what it says city with the worst pizza ever
[167:37.85]this is photoshop city with the worst pizza ever let me search for it myself uh America's best and worst cities for pizza this is from uh delish.com oh what's that oh oh oh hold on a minute uh the best we have New Haven Connecticut yes that's absolutely correct
[168:03.05]We've got New York, San Francisco, Portland, Providence, Rhode Island.
[168:11.63]That's all New England.
[168:14.27]The worst pizza in the country is apparently Philadelphia.
[168:18.73]Chicago?
[168:21.38]What?
[168:22.92]Doesn't deep dish look really popular?
[168:26.92]I thought deep dish was, people like love deep dish pizza.
[168:29.74]Detroit.
[168:32.10]Iowa.
[168:33.45]St.
[168:33.73]Louis, Missouri.
[168:38.09]Chicago having the worst pizza in the country?
[168:40.52]I don't agree with that.
[168:49.18]Boston, best pizza in the country.
[168:59.41]Although Regina Pizzeria, yup, topped the list as the best pizza restaurant in the country.
[169:05.84]Boston has ranked seven, seventh on the list of top US cities for pizza.
[169:15.82]Seven, it's top 10 in the country.
[169:17.92]It's top seven.
[169:19.70]And Regina Pizzeria is number one in the whole country.
[169:22.54]We don't have to have this.
[169:23.60]You know what?
[169:24.02]Get fucking cursed.
[169:34.79]Now you gotta eat a shitty domino speed- Alright, I can't- I can't say that, can I?
[169:44.11]Alright, play with cat.
[169:54.78]He just cursed us.
[170:06.74]Domino's.
[170:09.89]I'm gonna be fair to Domino's here.
[170:11.31]Do you remember when they had that whole campaign on ads on TV where the CEO read all the comments about people talking about how bad the pizza is?
[170:21.13]Hi, I'm CEO Kevin from Domino's Pizza.
[170:25.52]We've seen your comments on how our sauce tastes like ketchup and it's the grossest pizza on Earth.
[170:34.12]Remember that?
[170:40.58]Go and give the performance of your life you can do this.
[170:55.37]And here's the thing.
[170:57.25]After they did that whole campaign where they... And I'll give it to them.
[171:01.67]I really have to hand it to Dominoes.
[171:02.75]This is a brilliant strategy.
[171:05.65]They told everybody that their pizza was horrible.
[171:08.19]They said, our pizza sucks.
[171:09.73]It's disgusting.
[171:10.71]It's dog shit.
[171:12.09]But we changed the recipe.
[171:14.55]Give it a try.
[171:17.39]Everybody tried it.
[171:19.51]Like, oh yeah, Domino's sucks ass.
[171:22.15]But they changed the recipe?
[171:23.31]I'll order one.
[171:25.67]Just from that campaign 10 years ago, they made more money probably than they needed to in the next 10 years.
[171:45.45]What about you?
[171:46.19]My stream sucks, but we changed the campaign.
[171:48.14]It was brilliant.
[171:48.66]It was an absolutely brilliant campaign.
[171:49.86]It was.
[171:54.56]Brilliant.
[172:04.74]Hi, Jerma985 here.
[172:07.54]We've seen the complaints about how my stream is way too loud and way too quiet at the same time.
[172:14.66]we've decided to do is try it is double down let's see what you're made of boy Harvey boys which rolled a sarsky you're way quieter than the ads I just I don't want anyone to have a hurt here
[172:46.19]Get out of the kiosk!
[172:54.56]Oh my god, you're annoying.
[173:00.95]Double down.
[173:01.63]Like, I make it louder.
[173:04.79]And I talk quieter.
[173:18.76]Remember when I had sub sounds that were ten times louder than me?
[173:22.35]Oh, I remember.
[173:24.35]I remember.
[173:24.89]I miss those sub sounds.
[173:29.13]Sometimes I do too.
[173:46.68]But as this channel has gotten larger and the channel and the community has grown two or three times in the last three years, it would be like having TTS on screen.
[174:16.66]I miss the Salton Sanctuary days when Paul Bearer would talk for like 25 straight- I used to have a subsound that was 25 straight seconds.
[174:35.58]I wonder what that would be like if I did that again.
[174:38.86]Just for, like, 20 minutes.
[174:41.06]So you guys could- we could see.
[174:51.29]But I feel like it would be an inaccurate sampling.
[174:55.08]Because I think people would just sub to make sure that it played over and over again, right?
[175:04.52]Ooh!
[175:08.02]Am I seriously stuck?
[175:14.36]Why is he not dead?
[175:32.76]Do it... Do it till the end of the decade.
[175:37.31]We are not doing that.
[175:38.17]Oh, that's right.
[175:43.51]The decade's over tomorrow.
[175:44.59]That's right.
[175:45.03]Never mind.
[175:55.42]End of the decade.
[176:06.10]I'm going to sleep.
[176:06.84]Remove the external extension control.
[176:12.45]What?
[176:14.01]What the fuck are they talking about?
[176:16.57]Unplug the nunchuck?
[176:24.67]What?
[176:27.02]Move special.
[176:28.20]Shoot sword.
[176:38.55]I'm having a dream.
[176:40.09]I don't remember this at all.
[176:41.49]I have a sword too?
[176:42.31]I missed.
[176:42.67]I was testing out the sword.
[177:11.25]Explode.
[177:16.94]Pepe?
[177:17.28]What?
[177:17.52]Pepe?
[177:18.84]I can't go over there reliably.
[177:21.12]Oh, you can destroy bullets with the sword.
[177:28.48]That's how you get special.
[177:32.25]I get it.
[177:32.65]What's that?
[177:42.67]Ooh!
[177:58.58]What?
[177:59.02]I didn't know what was going on.
[178:04.23]I tried to press A. Continue.
[178:06.51]What's going on?
[178:13.01]Do I not have a special?
[178:13.79]It's not full?
[178:14.73]Alright, that's... Hey, I don't have a special.
[178:21.02]Oh, now I do.
[178:22.22]I get it.
[178:22.98]Whoa. Whoa. Whoa. Whoa.
[178:48.13]Warning.
[179:19.02]What the fuck?
[180:04.09]It's alright, I'm good.
[180:13.20]He's not even doing any damage.
[180:25.26]Getting close, all three.
[180:39.78]Destroys all the bullets.
[180:40.58]Oh, cool.
[180:43.32]What a fun little minigame.
[180:45.92]That was cute.
[180:48.50]Look, me.
[180:49.06]A, A, A, A. Connected back together.
[180:55.24]Okay, let's go.
[180:57.40]That was cute.
[180:58.70]That was a cute little game.
[181:01.40]I'm kind of tangled up, though.
[181:02.28]I don't even know how this happened.
[181:12.31]how did this happen I hate wires are you actually playing on a wii
[181:47.61]Put the disk back in.
[181:48.53]How are you playing with the disk out?
[181:52.85]I fucked it up.
[181:53.53]You said you're going to get a haircut before New Year's.
[181:57.94]Half tomorrow.
[182:00.02]Probably won't happen.
[182:15.13]And show me a world of drama and passion.
[182:18.73]One that I have never known before.
[182:22.24]But be sure to hit the bathroom first.
[182:25.48]That's actually not a bad idea.
[182:26.48]I have to go soon.
[182:29.04]Don't leave me waiting.
[182:31.84]Today, little Sylvia has done herself up quite well, I must say.
[182:36.65]My skin is so silky and smooth.
[182:40.81]This, quote, charisma makeup artist from Japan gave me, like, the most incredible color gradation ever.
[182:49.42]I will beat it tomorrow?
[182:50.26]I really hate how she says, tundaki, tundaki.
[182:53.88]I've been streaming for, like, three hours.
[182:57.16]We're going to be at, like, rank three.
[182:58.68]Today you are going to win with 2,000% certainty.
[183:04.17]One hot night together.
[183:06.19]You and me coming right up.
[183:11.67]Do a buzz cut.
[183:13.07]Or a bowl cut.
[183:18.09]A bowl cut would look so bad on me.
[183:24.87]Absolutely not.
[183:34.60]No, absolutely not.
[183:43.29]Do a bowl cut for the New Year stream.
[183:49.11]No, I can't.
[183:50.23]I could never make that work.
[183:53.79]I could never make it work.
[183:54.98]No, no.
[183:59.06]I'm not having those images and videos around forever.
[184:03.94]Like, eating a McChicken with mayonnaise all over my face and hands and stuff.
[184:07.82]I don't care.
[184:08.90]But having a real fresh bowl cut...
[184:12.63]I have to draw the line somewhere.
[184:25.01]New move.
[184:32.80]Shave your eyebrows and get a bowl cut.
[184:37.63]You've become a master pro wrestler.
[184:39.17]I think I'll book a match for you, but first a super hard suplex.
[184:42.63]Satan's ferris wheel, the double arm suplex.
[184:47.21]Nice.
[184:49.27]Jerma, you were in a slime diaper.
[184:51.77]That's less embarrassing than having a real bowl cut.
[185:07.19]Is it?
[185:07.71]I mean, I think so.
[185:11.17]You are late, handsome.
[185:12.71]Hurry, the show's about to start.
[185:17.04]What's with all the excitement?
[185:19.70]It is not every day you get to watch a big fight from VIP seats.
[185:23.72]Of course I am excited, but I am most excited being with you.
[185:29.41]Somebody said Elijah Wood did it?
[185:32.13]Elijah Wood makes like three million dollars in appearance.
[185:53.83]So do you.
[185:54.53]Oh!
[186:15.38]That actually went in.
[186:16.34]Quiet, quiet, please.
[186:18.08]What do you know?
[186:19.24]It's already time for the last program.
[186:22.02]But you know, today is a special day.
[186:25.06]And you, ladies and gentlemen, are lucky.
[186:28.34]So lucky that you might even get lucky.
[186:32.59]Now, one of you lucky people will be chosen to be up here with me.
[186:37.51]Who's it gonna be?
[186:39.39]The lucky person is... You!
[186:42.93]You!
[186:44.14]Wow, Travis.
[186:45.40]This is your lucky night.
[186:47.66]Me?
[186:48.60]They want me?
[186:49.60]Serious?
[186:50.66]You gotta be kidding.
[186:52.24]Go get him, Tiger.
[186:54.96]Come on, no need to be shy.
[186:56.80]Congratulations, you nasty little boy.
[186:59.75]Tell the audience your name.
[187:01.75]Travis Touchdown.
[187:03.53]It's a good name, don't you think?
[187:05.23]It's a fine name indeed.
[187:07.53]You have your parents to thank for that.
[187:09.93]My parents are dead.

[189:40.05]Come on.
[189:40.37]You don't have a very... This is barely an opportunity.

[189:55.49]Like that, yeah.
[190:08.62]Grab him!
[190:22.45]Number 4.
[190:27.88]He's long down to like number like 31.

[190:35.24]Jesus.
[190:35.58]What was this?
[190:36.92]Health?
[190:37.40]Oh, god.
[190:37.94]What does this do?
[190:40.40]I don't remember this.
[190:42.90]What?
[191:00.22]What the hell's going on?
[191:03.18]Do I have to... get out of this?
[191:07.38]I'm trapped in here with an animal!
[191:35.67]This is so dumb.
[191:40.37]I guess you have to have a few comedy bosses, right?
[192:01.07]Spin me back around.
[192:01.85]Good.
[192:03.93]He's dead.
[192:04.93]This guy wasn't even a chip.
[192:06.05]This guy was easy.
[192:08.19]Where the hell am I?
[192:10.95]Die!
[192:11.15]That was the easiest boss in the game.
[192:32.91]That was very easy.
[192:34.23]Why would they help do that?
[192:36.90]Aren't they supposed to be his friend?
[193:05.73]I got an S rank on that one, yeah.
[193:09.79]Two bosses go a little harder than that guy.
[193:17.72]That's the Pinwheel boss?
[193:21.46]The name is Travis Touchdown.
[193:23.87]Thank you all for coming tonight.
[193:25.85]I hope you enjoyed the show.
[193:28.00]I would also like to thank you for coming this evening.
[193:30.54]As a result, Travis Touchdown is now ranked fourth place.
[193:36.88]And the show will go on.
[193:39.00]I hope to see you all again soon.
[193:40.94]I saw the ball cut.
[193:41.88]And have a good night.
[193:43.44]That's number four.
[193:55.44]Or is it?
[194:03.24]That's it?
[194:06.24]Number four!
[194:07.14]I realize I'm the same age as Travis.
[194:13.70]How old is Travis Touchdown supposed to be?
[194:15.00]27?
[194:15.02]I thought he was older.
[194:21.69]29 in this game.
[194:30.70]So does that mean in No More Heroes 3, Travis is going to be 40-something?
[194:37.10]He'll be like 38 or 30.
[194:38.36]Yeah, he'll be like 40.
[194:39.12]That's pretty cool.
[194:43.03]I like that.
[194:44.25]I can relate to him more.
[194:45.35]Hmm.
[194:59.98]Yeah, because it's 10 years or 9 years, right, from No More Heroes 2?
[195:03.46]Or No More Heroes 1.
[195:08.81]10 years from No More Heroes 1.
[195:09.77]I think.
[195:13.71]Something like that.
[195:16.74]We're calling to let you know that the video you returned was a copy of one of our video titles.
[195:22.06]Um, the best of raunchy amateur interviews, too?
[195:26.63]You didn't seem to copy the whole tape, though.
[195:29.13]It ended two minutes into the middle of the first interview.
[195:32.93]Anyway, please be sure to return the original tape you borrowed.
[195:36.09]Thank you!
[195:37.94]I was too young to know or care or understand.
[195:43.72]Could you have done that with Blockbuster?
[195:45.82]If you rented a movie from Blockbuster, could you have just taped over a new tape or something?
[195:50.10]Was that possible?
[195:55.20]Was that even possible?
[195:57.14]You would need two decks, right, somehow?
[195:58.80]$450,000 new amount of money.
[196:06.55]had to be legit well you would just you would keep the copy you wouldn't return the copy right you would copy the tape and then give the original tape back to blockbuster did people do that yeah holy that would that's probably that was very horrible that's very rampant
[196:39.63]Save the game.
[196:40.44]Alright, game's already saved.
[196:42.06]We need to make $450,000.
[196:42.60]New job.
[196:42.94]Yep.
[196:43.02]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[196:43.90]Is this scorpions?
[197:13.32]This might be Scorpion mission time.
[197:14.56]I think there's only two more missions, or two more jobs that exist in the game.
[197:24.44]It's nine, right?
[197:26.97]And then another five assassin missions?
[197:30.09]Something like that?
[197:44.89]Off bike.
[197:47.23]I can't believe the hoverboard didn't work.
[197:49.79]Yeah, it'll get patched in though, don't worry.
[198:04.14]Meow meow.
[198:06.20]Capture the escaped cats.
[198:08.94]Use some foxtail grass to attract the cat's attention.
[198:27.54]Your bike sounds like a Star Wars blaster.
[198:31.92]Does it?
[198:32.24]Maybe a little bit.
[198:48.67]I can hear it.
[198:51.56]Yeah, a little, a little bit.
[199:02.21]Meow.
[199:02.69]I don't really understand the unspoken rules of Stand and Destroy.
[199:04.73]I'm trying to think a little more like a cat.
[199:06.72]Meow.
[199:07.52]Gotta find those cats before they get busy.
[199:09.46]I love meow love meow cats.
[199:12.18]So much that I keep two meow at any of them.
[199:15.67]I go crazy when one of the cuties gets out.
[199:17.83]If you like cats too, then lend me a helping paw.
[199:20.31]The god of cats is rolling around peering happily.
[199:22.21]Search for them.
[199:28.99]Let's go save the cats.
[199:31.33]Capture the cats that have fled into the town.
[199:33.84]Use some foxtail graphs to attract the cat's attention.
[199:36.26]Okay.
[199:36.50]What?
[200:01.27]I'll have to, okay.
[200:05.12]That's what foxtail grass is.
[200:14.72]I hate that meow he does, that meow.
[200:26.17]Get up!
[200:27.15]Get up, come on, play!
[200:33.14]It was B, not A. Come here.
[200:47.96]Pay attention.
[200:56.19]Fucking bee again.
[200:57.79]Ah, fuck, that sucks.
[201:00.15]I don't know.
[201:22.76]Where are you, in here?
[201:24.60]Where's this cat?
[201:31.26]This meow is activating your ASMR.
[201:42.06]That's funny.
[201:52.32]This one takes too long.
[202:02.29]Everyone's going to love this one because of the cats, but I don't think it's very efficient for money, but we have to do it long.
[202:20.27]Oh my god!
[202:22.33]Not interested at all, huh?
[202:26.69]You're just not interested at all.
[202:29.18]You don't care about any of this.
[202:33.21]Got it.
[202:40.73]Nice.
[202:41.55]Oh, there's one more.
[202:43.29]It's okay.
[202:49.11]What is it worth?
[202:50.89]No.
[202:51.57]Garbage is better.
[202:59.32]Buy a lot.
[203:02.52]Third raider, another job for you.
[203:10.39]Garbage is better than cat's balls for making money.
[203:12.21]Another assassination mission is available.
[203:16.31]And more free fights, but I have banned myself from free fighting.
[203:20.15]Because I waste 40 minutes trying to do them, and I don't make any money.
[203:28.60]Here we go.
[203:32.36]Extreme fight.
[203:34.24]Struggle against all odds.
[203:35.61]Kill all targets.
[203:36.67]All other details will be a nice surprise.
[203:39.59]Reward.
[203:40.15]It's a secret.
[203:42.47]Kill as fast as you can.
[203:43.23]Enemies are armed with live ammo.
[203:44.73]Mission ends when all targets are dead.
[203:46.75]7,000 per kill.
[203:48.69]Let's do the secret one.
[203:49.87]Let's try it.
[203:50.41]Extreme fight.
[203:52.73]Mm-hmm.
[204:08.55]You should drink carrot juice on camera.
[204:11.05]Nah.
[204:19.73]Well, can I put orange juice in it to make it taste better?
[204:24.61]Can I put 40% carrot juice, 60% orange juice, and then shave a little bit of ginger in there?
[204:33.34]We'll press some ginger in there, some juice.
[204:36.76]Can I do that?
[204:46.60]That sounds nice.
[204:47.24]It is.
[204:47.54]It's very nice.
[204:48.74]It's very, very good.
[204:51.44]Yeah, that's just a little bit.
[204:52.80]Not very much.
[204:53.24]Just like a squeeze of ginger.
[204:55.08]Not a lot.
[204:58.59]That sounds great, except for the ginger.
[205:00.07]Ginger gives it a nice little kick.
[205:02.17]Not too much, though.
[205:02.75]Just a little bit.
[205:04.27]You don't want to overdo it.
[205:10.97]So what's the secret?
[205:12.39]It's a secret.
[205:40.28]Oh, wait a minute, I can't, can I not, oh shit, these are, this is reverse too.
[205:48.25]It's alright, I can deal with it.
[205:55.48]Left is right and right is left.
[205:56.50]I have to mirror this too.
[206:09.79]Alright, now it's working.
[206:12.69]Supposed to be a problem?
[206:36.80]He's playing on a real Wii.
[206:38.34]Yeah, I turned my TV upside down for you guys!
[206:44.67]It is weird, but I'm playing in a little box over here.
[206:59.78]How did you mirror it?
[207:06.83]I just flipped it upside- I just turned your screen upside down, everything's fine.
[207:12.85]How much money is this worth?
[207:17.02]70,000?
[207:18.12]Oh, that's pretty good.
[207:21.28]That's pretty good for how short that is.
[207:22.86]I might just do that one, like, five times.
[207:38.90]What was the last one?
[207:39.88]Was it the baseball one?
[207:40.58]I'll do the baseball one, because it's fun.
[207:45.13]Or, no, we'll do that one again.
[207:46.91]It's just too easy to do that.
[207:51.97]What is going on?
[207:53.75]You guys are flipping your chat messages.
[208:01.35]That's... How are you doing that?
[208:03.68]What keyboard lets you do that?
[208:05.86]My spleen!
[208:07.04]My spleen!
[208:09.68]Invert the chat window.
[208:12.46]Invert... God.
[208:15.60]Alright, let's do it again.
[208:18.24]It's very, very simple once you do the cheat.
[208:23.53]I'm holding the keyboard upside down.
[208:25.21]That makes sense.
[208:38.27]Uh, I wonder if there's any katana parts I'll find out after this Jumped What does your spleen do I feel like I should know this but I don't what does it do
[209:18.25]It controls... ...blood stuff.
[209:24.97]It digests hair.
[209:26.21]It digests... I'm just catching what you said.
[209:53.43]70k, here we come.
[209:55.61]Here we go.
[209:58.57]I'm having a breakdown.
[210:01.44]No, you're fine.
[210:03.78]Just don't look at the stuff on the sides of the screen.
[210:20.25]It's like being on a rollercoaster.
[210:21.69]Don't like tilt your head side to side on a rollercoaster.
[210:25.02]It's the same exact concept.
[210:26.56]I'm freaking out here.
[210:31.50]Don't give it as much as you are.
[210:57.83]Okay, that's fine and we're good.
[211:02.29]I have enough for the feet.
[211:10.11]Well, you did omega- a megalol is supposed to be upside down too.
[211:12.67]Why did you not do a megalol?
[211:24.11]Hey, can we do something for a minute here?
[211:26.05]Please?
[211:26.77]Can we work together on something?
[211:29.07]Can everybody write messages upside down?
[211:32.88]Please, only write messages upside down.
[211:38.78]Because I'm going to flip this vertically, and some people are going to trickle in, and I'm going to be panicking about what's wrong with my Twitch.
[211:48.17]Just get generic, random sentences.
[211:54.59]You know, get like just random generic sentences that are upside down.
[212:01.35]And only put that in.
[212:02.73]Only spam that.
[212:04.57]I don't know how.
[212:05.19]It's alright.
[212:05.51]Well, then the people that... Yeah, just put everything upside down.
[212:07.85]Okay.
[212:15.67]Let me do this real quick.
[212:20.97]Hold on.
[212:24.33]Keep it up, you're doing great.
[212:32.12]Okay, ready?
[212:33.06]Let's give it a try.
[212:33.86]I need to, like, turn this off.
[212:53.71]Okay, here we go.
[213:15.91]Um.
[213:19.92]I don't know.
[213:20.56]Something's wrong with my Twitch.
[213:26.20]Is anybody getting this error?
[213:27.24]There's a weird error message that's coming up on my screen.
[213:37.33]That's hard.
[213:39.43]I can taste iron, too.
[213:41.35]Can anybody else taste iron?
[213:43.53]Can anybody taste iron right now?
[213:51.27]what's happening what are you doing are you doing this or are you about my way you doing it Oh stop right upside down that's funny
[214:45.40]I'm trying to Spider-Man kiss you.
[214:54.19]Ow, shit, that was loud.
[214:55.58]I don't know why, it's because they have both headphones in.
[215:16.45]You should have talked upside down to... How do you talk upside down?
[215:19.95]What do I need for money?
[215:34.78]I have... What was my money?
[215:38.40]$449.
[215:38.48]I need, like, $15.
[215:40.40]First of all, let's go check out the blades.
[215:43.46]I think that's one thing I'm missing, right?
[215:48.69]Just play your voice in reverse.
[215:50.19]I mean, I can't do that without doing a bunch of editing.
[216:01.56]That was a nice David Lynch Twitch channel.
[216:17.93]What it's like to chew 5G gum.
[216:23.98]Highlight that one.
[216:25.48]That's great.
[216:29.57]Alright, so though, what about the part?
[216:30.77]Oh, I already did it.
[216:31.73]Okay.
[216:32.09]No, we're good.
[216:34.37]Let's get out.
[216:49.10]What it's like to chew.
[217:04.88]Why am I still upside down?
[217:05.76]I shouldn't be.
[217:14.30]Alright, here we go.
[217:18.14]what it's like to chew 5G gum.
[217:50.21]The fucking game- I just broke something.
[217:54.45]That was- The game music fucked it up.
[217:56.11]Let's just play this.
[218:04.26]Ah, god damn it.
[218:10.44]Try it again.
[218:10.92]I can't do- This is what happens when I take off my fucking head-somes.
[218:17.04]Head-somes?
[218:20.06]Do it again, do it again.
[218:20.88]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[218:34.17]There.
[218:40.82]What it's... What it's like to chew 5G gum.
[219:22.30]Yeah, it was alright.
[219:25.06]It was alright.
[219:27.96]It was better with the music.
[219:36.13]Put it on the ballot?
[219:36.81]No, it don't count because it's not even legal!
[219:39.71]It's not even legal!
[219:50.40]Here's $50.
[219:51.08]Don't do the 5G gum joke anymore.
[219:54.67]Alright, I promise I won't.
[219:57.45]Thank you, Phylactery.
[219:58.27]$50.
[219:58.91]It was better with the music.
[220:02.93]I knew I shouldn't have done it again.
[220:04.95]I saw, do it again, again, again, again.
[220:07.43]No, no, the music made it fucking fine.
[220:14.48]This is the second huge raid of the night.

[221:17.16]Turn it off.
[221:17.80]Turn off follower only mode.
[221:18.70]This guy's a... Put it on no followers only.
[221:20.70]Or no, on... What do I want to do?

[221:55.85]Don't!
[221:57.63]Don't!
[222:00.43]Oh, you're the worst!
[222:01.01]You're the worst!
[222:03.21]You're the worst!
[222:03.63]You're the worst!
[222:04.05]They both have guns!
[222:04.83]Look at how many guns they have!
[222:05.69]Did I just block them?
[222:15.32]Sorry.
[222:18.12]This shit is... that's too hard.
[222:27.85]I want the 5G gum joke again.
[222:31.93]I'm happy.
[222:32.44]You know, that... You know when you look at, like, Rotten Tomatoes, and you see the movie, for instance, like, Cats, right?
[222:39.22]It's like, unanimously, people are like, well, this movie's terrible.
[222:41.64]What a shitty movie.
[222:43.66]And then you go through, like, the audience reviews, and they're all like, worst movie I've ever seen in my whole life.
[222:48.20]The CG, what a dis... Just an absolutely disgusting movie.
[222:52.72]And then you keep going and there's a five-star rating in there and it's just somebody that just has no idea They don't they don't care.
[222:58.55]They're just like I like this movie.
[223:00.95]It was really fun when the cats were on screen And it was the best movie I've ever seen I'm so happy that there's at least one person giving me a five-star review in here You like dumb people
[223:20.44]What?
[223:20.88]What do you mean dumb?
[223:22.90]If you like cats, it doesn't mean you're dumb.
[223:29.63]I saw it.
[223:31.09]I went alone to the theater.
[223:32.97]And I thought it was great.
[223:35.31]I loved it.
[223:38.38]But I'm scared to write a review because I think people are going to call me names.
[223:43.46]What?
[223:52.90]What do you mean he saw the joke?
[223:53.84]What are you talking about?
[224:02.51]What's going on?
[224:03.27]I'm answering the phone.
[224:04.81]Who saw it?
[224:05.23]What are you talking about?
[224:08.83]Who?
[224:12.68]No, no, no, no, no.
[224:14.68]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[224:17.32]No.
[224:20.46]No.
[224:21.22]He didn't see it, right?
[224:21.98]He didn't see it.
[224:22.52]They all saw.
[224:22.92]They all saw.
[224:23.26]They all saw.
[224:23.88]But I don't think they heard anything.
[224:26.72]It was just me chewing.
[224:49.29]It's just me chewing.
[224:51.93]To anybody that has no idea, I'm just chewing on gum.
[225:10.09]They could hear.
[225:10.95]Oh wow, he just turned his webcam on.
[225:16.07]Oh man, that's fun.
[225:26.61]But seriously, welcome.
[225:29.63]Thanks for the raid, seriously.
[225:30.59]I hope you have a good new year too.
[225:33.11]I'm just crashing!
[225:36.91]I gotta make five dollars.
[225:48.66]Do I have the money?
[225:49.46]No, go to the gym.
[226:06.19]Deposit or go to the... What should I do?
[226:07.33]Deposit or go to the gym?
[226:08.85]I think I'm going to just deposit and let's go.
[226:10.37]Let's do it.
[226:28.89]What do I need?
[226:33.15]I could, you know, I'm gonna do one more assassin mission.
[226:35.64]And I'm gonna go from there.
[226:46.36]Do a ninja warrior stream against an athlete.
[226:51.77]I would probably be okay in those.
[226:53.95]I would perform pretty well.
[226:59.33]Although I can't right now.
[227:04.13]I would actually like to do that.
[227:08.46]Which one hasn't been done?
[227:09.44]This one.
[227:10.60]Wrestling moves only.
[227:11.44]Let's do it.
[227:11.78]2012 Jerma could have done it.
[227:16.58]Probably.
[227:28.53]How many channel points for a 5G gum joke?
[227:44.58]No.
[227:48.13]No, I can't.
[227:49.29]Not again.
[227:52.88]That is really funny, though.
[227:53.96]That box box opens the stream and says, hey, this is, we're gonna raid, let's go.
[228:00.22]And it's, oh, his cam just turned on.
[228:04.67]I thought we were in the clear.
[228:05.57]Oh, well.
[228:12.87]Wrestling moves only.
[228:19.90]You're 70,000 away from a JermaWink?
[228:21.88]Save up.
[228:32.52]Is it only, uh, gun people?
[228:34.98]No, that actually sucks.
[228:39.06]Why can I s- Oh, ro- Wait, what?
[228:44.38]I'm trying to... This is... Okay.
[229:03.44]I wish I could sprint here.
[229:10.36]This is gonna be hard to get this guy.
[229:18.17]The guy behind him!
[229:22.73]Get him!
[229:32.58]Get rid of this guy behind you!
[229:34.82]You motherfucker.
[229:36.24]Get him!
[229:38.00]Is this 7,000 or 5,000 for kill?
[229:40.36]Knock him out.
[229:41.70]DDT, that's the best move in all of wrestling.
[230:03.89]It's 7.
[230:04.45]Nice.
[230:04.61]That's really good.
[230:05.66]This'll be alright.
[230:11.50]Is he wrong?
[230:37.05]Don't run, don't run, don't run, don't run, don't run, don't run, don't run, don't run, don't... Ah, and you've ran over here.
[230:46.75]Again.
[230:48.53]Again.
[230:48.79]Where's your wink?
[230:53.30]You need 75,000 tournament points.
[230:54.88]That's a lot.
[231:09.62]Oh well.
[231:09.88]I think that's enough to level up.
[231:10.94]This game has worse graphics than GTA 4.
[231:12.18]Well, that's because it does, it, yeah.
[231:13.42]This thing was on the Wii.
[231:42.05]The Wii was just a GameCube that they injected with steroids.
[231:47.83]Though, I mean, it's not surprising.
[231:49.07]Let's go to the gym.
[232:05.24]And I mean, the console was bad.
[232:06.42]The Wii was awesome.
[232:11.99]I'm going to make a statement here, and it might sound a little controversial to some of you guys.
[232:16.50]I don't know.
[232:16.96]We'll see.
[232:17.38]I think the Wii is the best, most appealing-looking console.
[232:29.03]I loved the shape and how much it weighed and how small and compact it was.
[232:34.56]I loved that, just the Wii console.
[232:37.46]I thought it was really, really cool.
[232:38.60]I like the top, the pop-top off of the controllers.
[232:44.72]I really, really enjoyed the Wii.
[232:47.86]It was shiny and sleek.
[232:49.84]It was small enough.
[232:50.58]It had the little tray.
[232:52.00]Putting discs in, putting a GameCube disk in was so cool.
[233:00.75]We're gonna do this one.
[233:02.69]And that's it.
[233:05.42]It was a very well-designed machine.
[233:08.13]It had the Virtual Console.
[233:19.52]It had Super Mario Galaxy.
[233:22.82]It had No More Heroes.
[233:25.36]It had... Carnival Games.
[233:33.15]Which I think sold better than No More Heroes did.
[233:38.40]In fact, Carnival Games may have sold better than Mario Galaxy.
[233:56.89]It has Manhunt.
[234:00.97]Isn't Manhunt the games where you just walk up behind people and, like, strangle them with plastic bags?
[234:13.82]It is.
[234:14.12]Okay.
[234:14.44]I'm thinking of the... Rockstar made it, right?
[234:16.78]I'm thinking of the right game.
[234:23.33]Is this baseball?
[234:24.69]Is this arm?
[234:28.87]What is this?
[234:33.55]Manhunt is banned on Twitch.
[234:36.33]Is that real?
[234:59.53]I mean, I guess I can kind of understand.
[235:05.31]I mean, without that entire game, don't you just, like, hide or, like, sneak around and, like I said, flatten?
[235:10.13]Don't you just strangle people to death and that's it?
[235:13.51]And, like, put hooks in their heads and stuff?
[235:17.75]Is there a game to Manhunt, or are you actually just sneaking around and murdering people?
[235:39.03]There is a plot.
[235:45.58]Is there a point to THIS game?
[235:49.48]Would you run- YES!
[235:50.36]I'm trying to be the number one assassin in the United States!
[235:57.30]I'm not just creepin' around with a bunch of, like, grocery bags!
[236:03.98]Who's that guy over there?
[236:04.98]Yeah, I'm gonna put a plow chuggin' with a plastic bag!
[236:08.86]What do you mean the same thing?
[236:20.18]That was a lot of money.
[236:20.84]Alright, let me go to the gym.
[236:33.83]And we'll do assassin number three.
[236:36.01]Get into the top three.
[236:38.99]Getting to the actual end of the game here coming up soon.
[236:42.15]The end game.
[236:43.91]End of the game.
[236:46.39]Yep.
[237:10.23]I had a dream where Jeremy played Manhunt on stream naked and everyone was spamming TOS.
[237:23.84]Like, I wouldn't know.
[237:24.72]Dude, hey, you're like, you're having sex on stream.
[237:30.65]TOS!
[237:32.99]I... What?
[237:37.87]Oh, there's a bunch of people that probably weren't here like four hours ago.
[237:41.87]Somebody explain it to him.
[237:48.48]Like, you're trying to warn me about that?
[237:50.64]You're warning me.
[237:52.26]Dude, this is TOS.
[237:54.52]I would rethink this while I'm...
[238:07.00]I can't get over that.
[238:08.87]This is the endurance, right?
[238:10.85]Increase.
[238:12.13]Max.
[238:12.99]Vitality.
[238:13.55]Yeah, this is a good one.
[238:35.62]Turn the webcam on to prove.
[238:38.38]I don't have to do that.
[238:44.32]What do we got for a time for New Year's Eve?
[238:46.20]Or New Year's Day for, uh... Tonga.
[238:56.54]Eight hours from now.
[238:57.64]Oh.
[239:14.97]I genuinely thought my message got buried, but I had a dream a couple days ago where Jerma got me 67 physical copies of Terraria for my laptop.
[239:23.73]Each copy was the weight and size of like a school textbook.
[239:38.67]In a lot of you guys' dreams,
[239:41.93]I somehow turn into this weird folklore monster.
[239:55.54]I turn into stuff that you read about.
[239:59.86]Going through Norse mythology or something.
[240:02.28]Alright, where's my house?
[240:32.48]Moo!
[240:33.58]Are you saying that you are not a mythical creature?
[240:35.42]I'm saying I am.
[240:36.16]I don't have to say anything.
[240:50.05]You make your own deductions from that.
[240:54.88]Wrong place.
[241:04.68]Statistically speaking, you're probably at least one person's... Someone's paralysis demon.
[241:11.99]Maybe.
[241:14.31]Sorry, by the way.
[241:22.39]I'm not doing that.
[241:23.88]That's just your... Your personification of that... Sleep issue.
[241:29.34]Well, this is a big three.
[241:33.88]I won't.
[241:34.18]I do have new TV shows to watch.
[242:04.22]Let's see.
[242:05.98]Video game?
[242:06.60]The title is pure... Wait, I own this now.
[242:09.80]That's cool.
[242:16.37]That's the one that I dreamed about.
[242:26.76]Brain Buster.
[242:27.54]That's one of the best moves in all of wrestling.
[242:29.24]I'm pretty sure it's illegal now.
[242:31.16]I don't think you can do that move anymore.
[242:36.11]Hurricane Rana.
[242:37.87]Nice.
[242:44.01]On to battle number three.
[242:55.42]Dear Travis, here's a highway bus ticket.
[242:57.02]You know where the bus terminal is, right?
[242:59.42]Take the bus to meet the witch.
[243:00.48]She's got powerful magic, but you can kill her.
[243:02.92]Just come back alive.
[243:07.07]What about the cat?
[243:08.55]What about the cat?
[243:09.13]The cat just got out.
[243:21.40]Oh no.
[243:25.22]Jean is gonna turn into one of the cats that you have to find during the part-time job mission.
[243:45.41]Almost got them all.
[243:59.84]Bad ending.
[244:01.64]Eh, I'll get the- I'll be fine.
[244:11.46]Oh no, it's the bus driver from the other day.
[244:13.83]You little bastards.
[244:21.11]Let me in.
[244:24.35]A lot of people over here.
[244:41.93]holy he almost speeded another cock different enemy type yeah
[245:13.97]Time to get on the bus.
[245:17.13]Or maybe not.
[245:18.21]There's somebody there.
[245:21.76]Oh shit.
[245:40.59]Fuckin' you in nuts!
[245:42.49]I missed the nuts guy.
[245:45.93]I missed the guy.
[245:46.55]I missed the nuts guy.
[245:47.39]He was only in the game for like five seconds.
[246:03.40]Speed city.
[246:09.22]Who's driving the bus?
[246:10.14]Me?
[246:15.91]Is there a wheel back here in the middle?
[246:22.66]It's a ghost bus.
[246:35.07]What the fuck?
[246:37.77]Oh, it's a side-scroller now.
[246:42.77]Nice.
[246:44.20]I forgot about this.
[246:45.20]I don't even remember this at all.
[246:46.44]I really don't.
[246:51.42]Swing!
[246:52.28]What the fuck was that?
[246:56.22]Let me up!
[246:57.94]Ugh, please!
[247:10.41]I am getting rocked.
[247:14.91]There we go three slot machines and not one Alright, that guy got one hit killed
[247:47.15]I'll mess you up good.
[247:48.39]I gotta get underneath.
[247:51.79]There it is.
[247:52.73]Here we go.
[247:58.06]Oh my god.
[248:04.06]Finally.
[248:05.48]I actually get to utilize it.
[248:08.93]It's taken me twelve hours in the game.
[248:11.73]Or at least eight.
[248:14.51]Or nine.
[248:15.01]Well, here's the phone.
[248:29.93]Do I fight on the bus?
[248:34.96]Travis, hello?
[248:36.60]Next up is a ranked match.
[248:39.39]Hit the red button on the iPhone.
[249:08.11]Change number, break the phone in half.
[249:13.18]Move to a different state.
[249:21.16]Nothing can change that.
[249:23.72]Honestly, where do you think you're heading?
[249:27.37]There are legions of more powerful opponents out there.
[249:31.39]Never forget that.
[249:32.89]Keep your feet on the ground, your head out of the clouds, and assist...
[249:40.52]Okay.
[249:40.94]Is there a bathroom on the bus?
[249:42.68]I don't think so.
[250:17.04]There's a bathroom out here?
[250:18.66]Bathrooms on the bus are the worst.
[250:19.86]I'm not sure I've ever been on a bus long enough where I've had to use the bathroom bus.
[250:28.67]Reverse that.
[250:29.13]You know what I mean?
[250:32.14]Found the cat.
[250:42.77]I think the longest I've been on a bus was maybe a few hours?
[250:46.81]A couple hours, maybe?
[250:47.63]The longest I've been on a bus was 14 hours.
[251:03.54]Holy shit, where were you going?
[251:05.58]From where to where?
[251:11.33]I've never had to be on a bus long enough for the bus to need to get gas.
[251:17.19]So... Probably less than... Yeah, something like that.
[251:24.14]Because if you're on a bus for 14 hours, doesn't that bus need to stop and get gas?
[251:32.54]How do you get... Do you just pull... Alright, this is a real question.
[251:35.16]I might sound like a fucking idiot.
[251:37.42]So if you're on a bus for like 15 hours, you have to stop and get gas.
[251:42.47]Do you just pull over to a gas station and just everybody just kind of hangs out while the bus driver gets out and fills the gas tank?
[251:50.01]Is that like what happens?
[251:54.93]Pretty much, yeah.
[251:58.57]So just what kind of like a highway rest stop?
[252:07.28]Stay back!
[252:08.48]This one's mine!
[252:10.19]So back off!
[252:11.07]Alright, there's a guy that's been training me.
[252:13.33]A cat?
[252:19.92]You frightened me for a second, kitty.
[252:22.04]Master!
[252:29.13]No Oh, he exploded
[252:59.45]That was a true explosion.
[253:01.57]Was it the cat?
[253:04.37]Why are all men so freaking ignorant?
[253:07.30]They never learn, no matter how old they get.
[253:10.68]They never learn.
[253:13.62]You are the third ranked assassin, bitch?
[253:21.38]Ursula?
[253:22.36]You were saying, Sonny?
[253:23.96]I asked if you were ranked third.
[253:28.87]What'd you say?
[253:31.09]I said, are you the third ranked assassin, Granny?
[253:35.24]What?
[253:35.82]Say that again.
[253:37.04]Dodged.
[253:37.86]I'm kind of hard of hearing.
[253:39.56]I can't hear much these days.
[253:42.60]Are you ranked third?
[253:44.44]Ah, this time I heard you.
[253:47.46]Yeah, I am.
[253:50.21]Okay, there.
[253:51.41]Like, rooster gun?
[253:53.41]That's right.
[253:53.97]Don't you see?
[253:56.94]Here we go.
[253:57.30]Oh, it's because she's a crazy cat lady?
[253:58.94]She's gonna fire something at me.
[254:00.20]Where do I go?
[254:29.35]Battery I can't sprint, you can't... I can hide in here, can I?
[255:04.72]I bet you it's a one-hit kill when I get up there.
[255:09.28]Oh, shit.
[255:09.54]I'm gonna bang left at mirror and get battery.
[255:39.34]Fuck.
[255:46.15]Okay.
[255:48.93]Break the doors?
[255:49.83]Why can't I break the doors?
[256:06.91]I'm losing health.
[256:07.77]Yeah, I can get up there.
[256:10.25]Gee, I wonder.
[256:10.89]I'm good, I'm good.
[256:11.61]I can get up there.
[256:13.67]You're being too greedy.
[256:14.73]I'm alright.
[256:15.96]I'm still alive.
[256:24.16]Oh, there's people in here.
[256:29.15]Can I just bait them outside?
[256:43.76]They're hiding from this lady, too.
[256:44.92]Well, why don't we work together, then?

[257:31.86]Don't kill me.
[257:35.88]Holy shit, dude, you hit me like six times.
[257:50.67]Everything's slow motion, right?
[257:53.81]What?

[259:11.44]This is perfect.
[259:35.93]Get him.
[259:38.77]Oh, I tried to do it.
[259:39.43]It didn't work.
[259:39.89]Hit him.

[260:07.52]And we have a chance.
[260:33.60]Goodbye.

[262:17.05]Spot to go around here?
[262:19.11]No?
[262:19.61]There?
[262:21.31]Is there another spot?
[262:22.13]I don't see another spot.
[262:29.13]I'm gonna go back through here.
[262:31.28]I'm gonna go around.
[262:39.96]There's a spot. There's a spot. There's a spot. There's a spot.
[262:53.13]Oh shit, there's people back here.
[262:59.88]Don't kill me.
[263:00.62]Don't kill me.
[263:01.32]I'm dead.
[263:05.84]My tongue is out of my mouth.
[263:09.94]Oh, there's people everywhere.
[263:12.21]Is there health back here?
[263:19.82]Get out of my way!
[263:33.35]I'm targeting the guy on the ground!

[263:58.88]Holy shit!
[264:26.37]Just sit in a building?
[264:28.53]She doesn't have a lightsaber, right?
[265:04.69]Okay, she doesn't have a lightsaber.
[265:06.21]All I know is she would take out like a knife with a little blade or something.
[265:15.05]Pretty good boy.
[265:16.75]Damn right.
[265:17.83]I'm an apprentice of the master.
[265:19.93]Thunder Liu.

[265:49.02]That was an honorable death.
[265:54.20]We didn't get destroy manned.
[266:09.39]I was gonna say, if I miss that a fourth time, then there's no hope for me.
[266:20.80]Alright, give me the katana.
[266:23.80]Obtain the Japanese katana.

[271:31.85]They use it a lot.
[271:33.18]It's in most of the scenes.
[271:42.16]What was that?!
[271:44.50]Why is this just IMMEDIATELY why is sorting algorithms playing?! !
[271:49.45]Is this the last thing I put on stream?
[271:55.12]Oh, where's it coming from?
[271:56.16]I don't know where it's coming from.
[272:01.60]It's supposed to be... Okay.
[272:05.14]Browser source.
[272:09.39]Jesus Christ.
[272:14.01]Here.
[272:19.38]This is the wrong video.
[272:22.71]That's not the right video.
[272:30.13]Where... Why do... Somebody link the one that... Somebody link the... What's the one I just had?
[272:36.28]Link it.
[272:43.48]I've turned this shit off.
[272:44.62]It's killing me.
[272:52.78]How did I fuck this up almost three times in a row?
[272:54.94]I don't know.
[272:55.26]Alright, here you go.
[273:00.43]How it feels to chew five gum.
[273:03.91]Stimulate your senses.
[273:30.06]Didn't say 5G.
[273:32.32]Could you make something sound like G?
[273:34.56]You know, like what it's like to chew.
[273:38.67]You could probably take the C-H.
[273:42.53]So it's like 5G.
[273:43.05]5G.
[273:43.33]Yeah, you could do that.
[273:48.35]From when he's talking.
[273:50.39]Take the C-H and chew and cut that up and put it in front of 5.
[273:55.13]What it's like to chew 5G.
[273:56.61]Yeah.
[273:57.25]It would work.
[274:01.45]That would work.
[274:02.21]We haven't looked at the t-shirts in a while.
[274:04.47]Let's do that.
[274:05.01]Come on in, brothers.
[274:27.33]Let's get some new clothes.
[274:30.67]Something snazzy.
[274:32.07]New jacket.
[274:32.85]I want to get all new clothes.
[274:34.11]I got, what, 400,000?
[274:36.47]Yeah.
[274:36.89]Give me some new shit here.
[274:40.39]Something.
[274:40.75]Because this is going to take us to the end of the game.
[274:46.27]What, snakeskin?
[274:46.95]It's $177,000.
[274:48.45]The blue?
[274:59.43]Tiger?
[275:02.80]Tiger is pretty alright.
[275:06.60]Tan?
[275:08.90]I like the blue.
[281:10.66]Hello?
[281:31.60]That's 3,000 per scorpion, right?
[281:32.84]You can actually make this pretty lucrative.
[281:35.98]Don't sting me, motherfucker.
[281:37.00]Get out of here.
[281:38.12]Where'd he go?
[281:50.87]That one's gonna try to sting me.
[281:52.55]It's a Goldman.
[281:55.67]It must be worth more.
[282:00.21]I stepped on it.
[282:02.55]Son of a... God damn it.
[282:20.75]Thankfully, it does not stack.
[282:23.39]That'll be bad.
[282:34.94]There's a shitload over here.
[282:35.88]There's a jackpot.
[282:51.27]Watch it, don't get stung.
[282:58.81]Whatever, I got 22.
[283:06.05]That's like 60 what, 60... 66,000?
[283:10.92]I'll do that one again.
[283:15.66]Now that I know, I know a pretty good strategy now.
[283:29.13]You gotta wear all snakeskin for this coming battle.
[283:32.89]I just spent all that money, though.
[283:35.93]I spent all that money, and it's gonna cost like 300,000 to be snakeskin.
[283:45.16]We'll see how much money I have, after I do all the little side stuff.
[283:51.75]Alright, what is this?
[283:53.07]Kill all the enemies within the time limit.
[283:54.35]Mission ends when all targets are dead.
[283:55.67]5500 to kill.
[283:58.46]Kill all the enemies within the time limit.
[283:59.90]The type of enemy you will fight is a secret.
[284:02.56]Mission ends when time runs out.
[284:03.86]1500 per kill.
[284:07.42]The gamble fight.
[284:08.38]Do I have to wager money?
[284:24.91]I'll go.
[284:25.13]I'll go all in.
[284:26.51]If it's possible.
[284:38.98]It's right here.
[284:39.64]This is incredible.
[284:41.64]I'm gonna do this one over and over again.
[284:45.34]You don't have to go far.
[284:46.26]It's right here.
[284:49.04]Or right here.
[284:50.26]Alright, what the hell is this?
[284:57.66]Mission start.
[285:01.98]What's the gamble?
[285:04.44]Three, two, one, zero.
[285:09.66]Go!
[285:09.84]Go!
[285:10.30]Yeah!
[285:11.31]Yeah!
[285:12.61]Are you gambling currently?
[285:18.75]Go!
[285:18.95]Go!
[285:19.19]Yeah!
[285:19.61]Yeah!
[285:41.29]I should retitle this stream.
[285:44.23]I'm going to retitle the bot.
[285:45.85]It's called Cursed Links.
[285:49.03]There's a shitload of cursed links.
[286:13.07]This is a long time Two more minutes of this?
[286:27.60]I don't even lock onto anything There's no point
[286:55.20]I don't think you want that.
[287:02.20]Ooh, alright.
[287:05.28]Can't see anything.
[287:24.38]Dude you're muted.
[287:30.95]I'm shaking around right now actually.
[287:48.15]The thing is, as you can tell, me swimming around, this is what it sounds like when I talk when I do this.
[287:54.74]Here's Dan.
[288:12.11]This is going to be a shitload of money.
[288:18.56]This is going to be a huge amount of money.
[288:20.56]This is going to be more than $100,000.
[288:23.86]This is going to be like $180,000 straight.
[288:31.55]Do it!
[288:34.59]What the fuck was that?
[288:48.12]88,000.
[288:48.14]Wait, that's going to be 1,500 times 88?
[288:59.31]Oh my god.
[289:09.73]But that's three minutes.
[289:15.32]We want snake.
[289:16.14]We want snake.
[289:18.82]Hold on.
[289:20.62]It's close, though.
[289:23.38]The scorpions was three minutes.
[289:25.90]So, you're talking about, like, somewhere around $60,000, $70,000 for the scorpion one.
[289:30.99]$130,000, at least $100,000 for that.
[289:31.51]And it's right here.
[289:32.73]Alright, let's go get the new sword.
[289:33.75]I probably have enough, right?
[289:53.88]It's a snake sword?
[290:02.52]Please, please look at the gift.
[290:04.04]Please.
[290:04.42]It's like, it hurts my head.
[290:08.40]I feel like I'm looking at a kaleidoscope.
[290:20.56]This one's damn good.
[290:21.56]Of all the ones I've made, this one's definitely up there.
[290:28.00]This is $498,000.
[290:29.16]That's all my money.
[290:43.67]I guess I could go dig up some stuff in the ground.
[290:45.42]How much do I have?
[291:01.27]Okay.
[291:05.80]No, I need way more than that.
[291:16.89]Yeah, I'll get that sword.
[291:19.73]That's the next thing I'm gonna do.
[291:21.89]Alright, what can I do in... I'm just gonna... I'm gonna go do that one again.
[291:28.37]Snakesuit and the sword.
[291:29.43]Well, let me get the sword first, because then it'll make the missions faster.
[291:35.21]I'm gonna go do one of the other assassinations.
[291:46.32]This dude's digging for gold.
[291:48.84]Yes, he is.
[291:49.93]Yes, he is.
[291:54.15]Sorry, Jeremy.
[291:54.67]This is important.
[292:31.57]I closed my eyes.
[292:32.33]I didn't see what it said.
[292:33.09]What did it say?
[292:36.02]I knew it was a... image that had text on it.
[292:39.10]I don't know what it said.
[292:40.18]I just put it on.
[292:50.94]Got the goal to kill all the enemies within time with it.
[292:52.70]Alright, we'll do this one.
[292:55.83]This one seems easy.
[293:11.03]It said you can get a free iPad if you click on a link.
[293:12.77]I already have an iPad.
[293:14.15]Do I want two?
[293:24.66]What am I gonna do with two?
[293:25.46]Am I gonna set him up on my bed so I have three monitors?
[293:37.69]Get another one, have three iPads connected to a device that holds them up next to each other.
[293:45.28]I would say that's probably peak fuckface, I would say.
[293:48.34]Absolutely.
[293:53.13]So I can slide from the left one all the way to the right one in one go.
[293:56.91]I can play Fruit Ninja across three screens.
[294:15.55]Tape them together so they're at each other's backs and flip it around when you want to do something else.
[294:25.83]You know, that's... I mean, that's not... That's incredibly overdone.
[294:32.92]But that's still...
[294:36.68]There's an application, right?
[294:38.04]You have to go?
[294:41.12]All of them?
[295:05.79]This one's really easy too.
[295:10.93]No, the other one was hard.
[295:13.41]The other one just... I don't know if it just pays off.
[295:17.36]This is probably one minute.
[295:19.66]It's been almost one minute so far.
[295:34.87]15... I have a minute... I have a minute and 10 seconds left.
[295:42.91]You save about a full minute or so.
[295:46.01]And how much more do I get?
[295:48.92]Yeah, this one's worth doing.
[296:01.00]Time for the weapon.
[296:05.83]Well, when I get the new weapon, I'll do the gamble fight.
[296:08.04]Because then I can probably kill way more people.
[296:12.27]What did I get?
[296:13.79]80-something last time?
[296:14.41]I can probably go over 100.
[296:30.84]No More Heroes Part 2 stream.
[296:33.24]A.K.A.
[296:34.81]Jeremy clicks every link in the chat.
[296:46.49]Just hold on a second.
[297:04.41]Community Content Night.
[297:06.80]Yeah, something like that.
[297:09.44]Okay, here we go.
[297:10.62]The Tsubaki MK3.
[297:11.80]There goes all my money.
[297:14.60]Are there any parts for it?
[297:17.54]There are not parts for it.
[297:20.14]It's just the best one!
[297:37.11]Somebody made this into a real pillow?
[297:44.27]This image is freaking me out.
[297:48.07]This image is scaring the shit out of me.
[297:50.01]Where are you standing?
[297:52.40]Where are you?
[297:54.72]Is this a- look, okay.
[297:55.84]Look at this- is this a table?
[297:58.84]Look at how high up you are from that cup of coffee.
[298:08.10]This is weird, right?
[298:10.82]It's like this.
[298:11.36]That's that table.
[298:13.13]It's almost like you're... Why is that coffee so small?
[298:24.67]This is not a table.
[298:25.45]This is a floor?
[298:31.09]So this is just a gigantic pillow, then.
[298:36.88]Imagine forgetting that you put this on the pillow and waking up in the middle of the night to go to the bathroom Getting back situated comfortable and like turning your head in the dark and seeing that That's pretty scary
[299:06.26]This dude's never seen a rug before.
[299:07.52]I didn't expect the pillow to be that big.
[299:15.37]I thought it was you.
[299:16.37]Look, I'm working on it.
[299:17.17]I'm on the table.
[299:17.81]I'm working on it.
[299:19.25]I'm making this on the table.
[299:34.01]Jerma's entire house is carpeted.
[299:37.03]Yeah, even the bathroom.
[299:40.93]I want comfortable feet when I'm going to the bathroom.
[299:46.16]Alright, where's that one?
[299:46.96]I got the best weapon in the game.
[299:49.16]It's this gamble fight, yeah.
[299:52.86]Let's just go carve up people for three minutes and see if I can make $200,000.
[300:08.10]I might be able to get more than that.
[300:10.62]How strong is this weapon?
[300:13.93]Is it equally as far a distance between the third and fourth blade?
[300:22.33]It's not as strong, but it's faster.
[300:26.72]We'll find out.
[300:42.75]Oh, that's cool.
[300:44.35]This is awesome.
[300:47.45]This reminds me of a Power Ranger sword.
[300:50.97]Gotta rack him up.
[300:56.51]This guy's just walking away.
[301:14.14]Holy shit.
[301:15.94]Okay, that killed everybody.
[301:24.52]Rage is crazy.
[301:36.60]Well, this is worth it.
[301:41.60]I can't even spawn them fast enough to be able to kill them.
[301:51.64]It does take a little, some of the wind-ups take a little while here though.
[301:57.20]Looks like battery.
[302:17.56]You're literally killing people, dude.
[302:20.74]Yeah, I know.
[302:21.74]That's part of the game.
[302:31.05]Ridiculous.
[302:33.61]39?
[302:34.05]What did I have, 88 for?
[302:50.04]I love it.
[302:51.91]I love that spin, spin, spin, spin part.
[302:53.87]It's great.
[302:55.43]What am I watching right now?
[302:59.68]You're watching somebody farm money for the end game of No More Heroes Watch.
[303:16.96]Hey, spawn anybody.
[303:17.84]Let's go.
[303:18.18]Spawn, spawn.
[303:18.80]Bring him over here.
[303:19.39]All of you.
[303:22.27]Shit, I didn't do that.
[303:26.53]Why does he lie down?
[303:29.41]Okay.
[303:50.66]Too many.
[303:52.26]Too many people.
[303:55.92]Only one guy?
[303:56.62]I think I'm killing people too fast.
[304:10.15]I killed less people than last time.
[304:17.13]Yeah, I got only 80.
[304:17.81]I think they're dying so quickly that it takes two or three seconds for them to respawn.
[304:26.06]It was less than the last time.
[304:32.88]It's actually too strong.
[304:37.54]Do this high charge attack?
[304:41.58]Oh, you're right.
[304:42.94]I didn't even think to look for that.
[304:43.98]Let me try the heart.
[304:45.09]Let's try that.
[304:47.08]They say, do the high charge attack in the gamble fight.
[304:49.44]Alright, I'm gonna go for it.
[304:56.99]But, first, let's do this.
[305:03.74]What?
[305:03.98]That's an Omega Pog farming spot.
[305:07.60]Alright, he's supposed to be dead.
[305:21.46]Combo.
[305:23.25]Damn, this is expensive.
[305:24.25]Alright, combo.
[305:28.25]I think this is probably the last upgrade.
[305:30.35]Maybe there's one more after this?
[305:31.69]Come on, do it!
[305:33.55]You're not hitting the right notes.
[306:00.82]Strength.
[306:02.26]And then health.
[306:05.00]There's only 15 pounds.
[306:07.14]15, 30, 45... 90.
[306:07.26]This is like one... The bar is what?
[306:13.03]How much is the bar? 45?
[306:39.65]Do I have enough to do?
[306:45.39]I do.
[306:46.97]The final health upgrade.
[307:11.32]Alright.
[307:12.22]I just spent all my money, but... I can get it all back.
[307:16.25]So I'm gonna do some quick math here.
[307:22.81]I need to get the full snake suit.
[307:25.77]I need... $500,000 for the entry fee.
[307:27.89]Snake suit was... What?
[307:28.51]$200,000 or something?
[307:53.48]Let's do the... Let's try that technique that somebody said.
[307:58.96]Somebody in chat said, hey, dude, you can farm the fuck out of this place.
[308:03.61]Do the high charge at the gambling one.
[308:07.53]With this weapon, with these upgrades, you'll get a million dollars in no time.
[308:12.81]Let's try it.
[308:28.18]Mr. Streamer, there's a battery upgrade for the sword that gives infinite battery.
[308:31.26]Please get it.
[308:32.88]Well, there was no... It wasn't available yet.
[308:44.63]I wasn't on the list when I went there.
[308:57.13]Alright, so he's saying high charge into the group of people.
[309:03.22]See if I can get this to work.
[309:09.78]Low charge, okay, low charge.
[309:13.50]Have to find a spot.
[309:27.05]I can't even see where I am.
[309:33.01]What's going on?
[309:37.85]Hello?
[309:47.46]This camera sucks.
[309:53.65]It was high.
[309:55.66]Well, I can't move.
[309:59.45]Alright, well, this technique ain't gonna work.
[310:08.47]It'll take a long time to charge that up.
[310:11.17]And look at this battery.
[310:12.29]No, this ain't gonna work.
[310:13.17]It's too small of an area.
[310:40.19]That's only hitting one person.
[311:00.96]Wow, this guy sucks.
[311:03.56]I'm testing something.
[311:04.64]This is not for real.
[311:10.36]Holy shit, this guy's so bad at this game.
[311:12.48]Yeah, I'm just- alright, I- this is-
[311:36.71]He's gonna die in the gamble fight.
[312:01.93]Excuse me.
[312:02.29]I'm gonna die in a game fight.
[312:04.55]You need to have infinite battery for it.
[312:06.31]Well, that wasn't part of the deal.
[312:10.81]Where the fuck is everybody?
[312:41.88]Still got $36,000 for that.
[312:44.55]I think it was low, actually.
[312:45.71]I think it was high, actually.
[312:46.57]I think it was low.
[312:47.31]I think it was high.
[312:48.05]You know, it may have been low.
[312:51.13]No, fuck it.
[312:51.55]I'm just gonna do it my way.
[312:53.87]I'm doing it my way.
[313:00.06]I'm gonna do the scorpion mission right now, and I'm gonna get over $100,000 right now.
[313:02.72]Guaranteed.
[313:03.12]I 100% guarantee it.
[313:18.53]Or what?
[313:19.93]Well, or, uh, or what?
[313:22.38]Let's see.
[313:23.76]If I don't get at least $100,000 from the Scorpion mission... You know, bulk up, that's too risky.
[313:42.25]I'll get a body pillow made of my face.
[313:44.97]And it'll be in bed with me for at least three nights.
[313:47.45]Cameron's gonna think you're a psycho.
[313:49.93]Alright, so that it's $3,000 per
[314:15.94]Scorpion.
[314:17.14]Which means to get 100,000 you need to do... So let's say 30 would be 60,000.
[314:21.42]40... I need, what, 50, 40 what?
[314:22.16]How many?
[314:22.50]50-something?
[314:23.16]87, that's not correct.
[314:53.85]let's go
[315:45.89]Come on, I need like a big scorpion party.
[316:04.01]Come on, come on!
[316:12.01]By the way, if I do get over 100,000, you have to buy a body pillow.
[316:14.98]And up my face.
[316:15.96]No you don't.
[316:16.50]That's fucking weird.
[316:17.22]Don't do that.
[316:18.46]I'm trying to think of something for you to do.
[316:19.88]Don't- I don't want you to do that.
[316:21.00]I don't want you to do that.
[316:21.98]Don't do that.
[316:22.42]Nobody do that.
[316:30.84]Where's the spawns?
[316:35.10]I'm getting screwed here.
[316:35.88]This doesn't even count.
[316:36.68]Look at this!
[316:38.16]Where are they?
[316:38.64]There's nobody here!
[316:48.64]I've got... There's no more left.
[316:50.00]They're gone.
[316:52.71]There are no more scorpions on this map.
[316:58.15]That doesn't... No, this is bullshit.
[316:59.53]Like, that was bullshit.
[317:00.41]That was actually bullshit.
[317:01.83]Like, there was nobody here.
[317:03.71]There was nobody here.
[317:08.00]This one doesn't count.
[317:10.12]I got scammed.
[317:19.86]I actually got scammed.
[317:22.15]I just ran around in a circle for 15 straight seconds and there was no scorpions.
[317:32.11]The spawn rate was dogshit.
[317:33.67]No, that doesn't count.
[317:39.83]I died.
[317:40.23]I didn't fail it.
[317:57.05]Instead failed?
[317:57.69]Well, I died.
[317:58.79]So that's why it failed.
[318:02.95]Fine.
[318:03.93]I'll get it.
[318:04.40]I'll get it.
[318:04.94]Fine.
[318:07.34]I'm gonna shred it.
[318:08.92]After three nights.
[318:15.51]Why you come here?
[318:17.39]Little man.
[318:23.49]I'm not doing... I'm going to the killing one.
[318:25.43]These ones just... These are so bad for money.
[318:28.12]If I mow a lawn, I'll make like $20,000.
[318:30.08]I need like $600.
[318:56.72]Don't worry.
[318:57.70]I'll get it.
[318:58.26]I'm gonna get it.
[318:59.74]Don't worry.
[319:01.42]I'll find a spot of my choosing.
[319:06.19]Not of your choosing.
[319:08.37]No, of my choosing.
[319:12.77]Why does that exist?
[319:15.60]Wait, what?
[319:22.10]Somebody's selling this for $57? $57?
[319:29.61]What in the name of God $57 Read the reviews what I mean people have bought this people have not bought this There's a four-star review
[319:58.14]it's pretty big so only buy if you want to get something that fills a lot of space but other than that it's very good the floor pillows look excellent the floor pillows look excellent on my floor very good the print is clear and looks awesome very well made great pillows which are a great pillows which are a wonderful decoration accessory for every room quality is good colors are shining bright
[320:32.71]what is go what is going on we originally ordered this product to use as cases for sleeping pillows since the fabric used is rather rough to the touch it is not really suitable for that purpose however as its original and stated intended use is to be a floor pillowcase I will not count our failed experiment against that product for its intended purpose for the pillowcase is really good robust fabric keeps its shape machine washable clear vibrant colors that don't wash out
[321:01.98]Very good quality, and I can definitely recommend it if you want a shiny, pretty, happy case for a couch or floor pillow to lounge on.
[321:09.81]And then in brackets, consider getting a filler pillow along with the case if available.
[321:13.77]We didn't, and it's not trivial to come by a 90x90 centimeter pillow where I live.
[321:19.07]Printing and shipping was fast without any issues.
[321:20.97]My only request for Redbubble is to add actual sleeping pillowcases made out of the same fabric as the bedding covers of the product line up.
[321:35.27]shiny happy pillows similar designs what the fuck let's read these reviews this is on a different product completely separate it's just it's my it's the Jerm of fear face on another pillow
[322:01.94]We originally ordered this product to use as cases for sleeping pillows.
[322:04.89]Since the fabric used is rather rough to the touch, it's not really suitable for that purpose.
[322:08.55]However, as its original stated intended use, it is to be a floor pillowcase.
[322:12.15]I will not count it our failed experiment against the product.
[322:14.09]For its intended purpose, the pillowcase is really good.
[322:15.86]Robust fabric that keeps its shape.
[322:17.06]Machine washable, clear fiber colors that don't wash out very good.
[322:19.28]Quality that I can rest after I commit if you want a pretty shiny happy pillowcase.
[322:22.18]It's the same fucking thing.
[322:23.94]It's the same seven reviews.
[322:36.49]He's just discovering bots for the first time.
[322:42.97]This one has 53 reviews!
[322:46.41]Guys!
[322:48.23]Why would you want my face on a spiral notebook?
[322:54.89]What are these 53 reviews?
[322:59.58]Great notepad, well received.
[323:06.18]I really like it.
[323:06.70]I was surprised at first because I didn't think it would be so wiggly, but I soon started to use it for a lot of notes.
[323:14.80]The artwork on the spiral is great quality and the surface and pages were immaculate.
[323:21.82]Amazing.
[323:25.34]The notebooks were very sturdy.
[323:49.75]Why is there a shower curtain?
[323:52.35]Wait, this is a shower curtain?
[323:56.08]There's not a Jerma985.
[323:58.16]This one's fucking- this one sucks.
[324:01.42]What happened to this one?
[324:04.70]Did you not even bother to center the image?
[324:10.64]You just didn't even bother to center it.
[324:21.87]Rule of thirds.
[324:27.85]Hold on.
[324:31.01]Show, show.
[324:31.55]Alright, I'm gonna show.
[324:33.15]I can't, like, save these images.
[324:35.05]Hold on, let me put this on the screen.
[324:38.93]This is freaking me out.
[324:40.33]I could probably spend an hour looking at this stuff.
[324:53.12]Just do it.
[324:53.86]I'm not going to buy these.
[324:54.92]Alright, hold on.
[324:59.59]What happens if I do this?
[325:06.81]Not sorting out.
[325:13.73]No, I want a different image.
[325:18.29]I want different.
[325:19.53]Please.
[325:20.27]And thank you.
[325:22.09]Does this work?
[325:42.28]I can't interact with this.
[325:46.68]Why can't I?
[325:47.12]No, I have to do like, hold on.
[325:52.93]It's 80 fucking dollars.
[325:54.97]For what?
[325:57.37]You need to get the Jerma cover to match.
[325:59.31]What cover?
[326:02.39]Jesus Christ.
[326:03.43]Alright, this is like a whole nother stream.
[326:05.19]No, no, no, this is an entire nother stream.
[326:10.72]Before the New Year's party, I want to do this.
[326:15.90]This is ridiculous.
[326:16.78]This is what we're going to do for an intro.
[326:21.55]We're going to look up all the bootleg Jerma985 faces on shower curtains.
[326:35.86]This is ridiculous.
[326:50.48]People saying, hey, just like, dude, you gotta like take those down.
[326:53.56]You ever hear the phrase, for every door that's closed, three open?
[327:00.76]That's programmer lingo.
[327:12.81]For every door that you close, three more open.
[327:17.30]Fixing bugs and shit.
[327:18.43]That's... For every one that you get rid of, ten more will take their place.
[327:22.21]We don't say that.
[327:22.91]Yes, we do.
[327:25.08]I know, programmer.
[327:26.22]I know, programmer.
[327:26.86]And that's where I got it from.
[327:28.88]They told me that's what they say.
[327:49.96]He knows a program?
[327:51.06]Pog, yeah.
[327:53.32]I know people.
[327:59.26]There's a toilet?
[328:00.25]Don't!
[328:00.95]Alright, stop looking that stuff up.
[328:03.31]Because tomorrow, there's a lot of content there.
[328:06.85]I just saw a toilet lid with your face on it.
[328:09.09]No more.
[328:09.67]Don't look up anymore.
[328:23.41]Oh, I got fucked up there.
[328:44.43]Let them get back up.
[328:45.91]No!
[328:46.01]This sword's a monster.
[328:49.80]And this is Endgame sword.
[328:51.56]Come on, lock on somebody!
[329:20.77]I can't see.
[329:22.46]This guy is so bad at this game.
[329:26.12]He keeps running.
[329:45.83]It's been like six hours, and I still can't get that out of my head.
[329:54.23]Alright, let him up.
[330:14.72]The big one!
[330:15.24]The one that goes up doesn't kill very many people.
[330:24.47]It sucks.
[330:43.57]Come here!
[330:44.71]Yeah, the horizontal move is the best one, but it doesn't happen all the time.
[330:54.53]How am I doing on battery?
[331:00.38]Good?
[331:11.43]66, not good.
[331:12.15]80 again?
[331:43.70]Not even 79.
[331:44.30]This is a very good stream.
[331:52.38]I like this stream because it is the one I watch.
[331:53.98]Definitely 5 stars.
[331:54.82]The only thing is the stream is quite long.
[331:56.56]So I'll only buy it if you want something that fills a lot of space.
[331:58.96]Very good product. 235,000.
[332:11.52]That's enough to get the snake outfit, I think.
[332:14.26]At least a couple pieces of it.
[332:19.14]What about the entry fee?
[332:32.14]The entry fee, guys.
[332:33.40]I need $500,000.
[332:47.85]Yeah, fuck the snake suit.
[332:49.77]I ain't doing it.
[333:01.16]If there's still... Alright, I have two more fights to do.
[333:04.22]So if after this one... I got the money for it, I'll get it.
[333:10.56]I just bought these.
[333:14.95]I don't want to do this one again.
[333:16.03]What's the... This one's 7,000 per kill.
[333:22.13]7,000.
[333:24.09]Kill all targets.
[333:25.48]It's a secret.
[333:28.02]7,000 per kill.
[333:30.60]Kill as many as you can within the time limit.
[333:32.04]Missing when time runs out.
[333:34.34]How's this one?
[333:37.20]Gamble fight is going to be the most efficient.
[333:38.92]Yeah, but it's boring.
[333:41.23]It's just grinding.
[333:41.97]Alright, fine.
[333:57.97]I just saw something really funny.
[334:00.11]I can't... I'm not going to say it until tomorrow.
[334:03.32]It's so dumb.
[334:05.40]I just looked over here.
[334:06.36]I think we actually already saw it on screen, so let's just talk about it for one second.
[334:10.22]There's a $15.76 mug on this website.
[334:15.47]It says, Jerma985 tall mug.
[334:19.67]It's just a white mug.
[334:20.77]There's no branding.
[334:21.65]There's nothing on it.
[334:30.15]It's just a white mug.
[334:31.63]Just plain white.
[334:35.82]It's just the title of the listing.
[334:46.90]What are they trying to say?
[334:50.22]I don't know.
[334:51.06]Nothing, probably.
[334:51.92]It's probably just a robot.
[335:06.03]Pretty good start.
[335:11.89]Actually this is a really good start.
[335:41.53]Can't even hear the music.
[335:42.83]Yeah, it gets ridiculous.
[335:50.16]It's called the grind, man.
[336:11.24]Get them all on the ground.
[336:12.60]Ah.
[336:23.58]Got it.
[336:26.68]Alright, charge up.
[336:28.96]Alright, 32.
[336:33.78]Is that subs coming?
[336:35.00]ACDCfreak5 community subs, thank you.
[336:37.52]Appreciate it.
[336:40.99]Hopefully you can hear me right now.
[336:46.79]That's one.
[337:08.35]Is there a way I can get a right-to-left swing to happen more often?
[337:12.12]I don't think there is.
[337:16.06]I think it's random.
[337:20.62]This game is absolute sensory overload.
[337:22.16]Yeah, for these parts it is.
[337:24.49]Dammit, I didn't get it.
[337:36.85]There it is!
[337:39.38]Come on!
[337:39.98]Am I out of battery?
[337:41.92]You have a lot of left-to-rights.
[337:57.88]Left-to-right's bad.
[337:58.92]It's like the worst one.
[338:01.60]Down-to-up and left-to-right is the worst one.
[338:10.91]Right to left.
[338:16.95]Come on, that's alright.
[338:27.50]Come on, let me get more than 80.
[338:31.58]Did that count? 83.
[338:41.79]There's so many bootleg Jerma shirts.
[338:46.87]Yeah.
[338:47.75]There are a lot.
[338:48.57]How many pages exist?
[338:49.63]Some of these are stickers.
[338:57.68]The MK2 is probably better for this.
[338:59.42]It... yeah.
[339:03.28]It probably is, but... I need to do this one more time?
[339:11.61]I'm gonna do the baseball one, because I'm sick of seeing that same thing over and over again.
[339:18.12]Baseball one should be about 80,000.
[339:19.46]And then I'm pretty much there.
[339:24.04]Yeah, the MK2 is better for crowds.
[339:25.24]It's just bigger.
[339:36.37]It's the last one, right?
[339:40.37]Did I ever do the pizza one?
[339:44.50]Pro Wrestling Pizza Butt, the finale.
[339:48.54]I'm doing this one.
[339:51.08]75,000, it's all the guys with the lightsabers, but I have a much better weapon now.
[339:55.80]75k just to kill one person.
[340:11.23]I'm just gonna go in there and spam with the katana.
[340:15.41]Thanks for watching!
[340:46.03]What's going on here?
[340:47.19]What's going on, chat?
[340:47.99]What's going on?
[340:48.45]What are you guys doing?
[340:54.10]Put it on single-letter-only mode.
[340:59.72]I'm glad you can do that.
[341:10.23]Oh, wow, you can.
[341:10.71]Cool.
[341:16.64]Somebody spent channel points to write H. That's a real hero right there.
[341:26.52]Here we go.
[341:36.32]Get the CEO!
[341:45.39]I'm so much stronger than I was before.
[341:46.71]Come on, just get him.
[341:49.51]Come on, get him all lined up here.
[341:54.11]He's gonna kill one person.
[341:58.65]He's gonna kill the whole room.
[342:00.25]Come on.
[342:00.85]I need one big horizontal strike to do it.
[342:06.54]Is it?
[342:08.66]Oh!
[342:33.22]Get outta here!
[342:39.95]Where is he?
[342:49.98]75k.
[342:52.18]It's all about time, but still.
[342:53.50]75k.
[342:53.76]Good.
[342:57.85]I thought I... I... What is this?
[343:00.07]Is my thing broken?
[343:00.87]I thought this was supposed to be single letter only chat.
[343:02.93]What the fuck is going on?
[343:07.29]Alright, if I do this, then I have enough to go to the... Let's just go.
[343:12.82]Let me do this one.
[343:13.40]Right now.
[343:21.86]This one always gets me because it's right in a tiny little area.
[343:26.03]I have a good weapon.
[343:27.05]Come on.
[343:27.41]Don't get hit.
[343:33.74]I'm gonna get hit.
[343:35.24]I'm gonna get hit.
[343:36.35]Oh shit, where am I?
[343:52.76]What he thought it was on the ground he's done it look round what That was it too it's just it didn't register when I tried to swing the second time on the fucking old Wiimotes
[344:22.62]I'm doing garbage collection, and I'm gonna do rank two.
[344:27.75]Blame motion controller.
[344:32.71]Yeah, I'm gonna blame the motion controller from 20 years ago.
[344:35.25]I will!
[344:48.46]Do we have two letters now?
[345:00.54]Maybe it's because somebody put it in their mouth and messed it up.
[345:04.09]That would be a very strange person.
[345:05.61]I wouldn't... I wouldn't want that person near me or my family.
[345:09.65]Alright, final trash collection.
[345:29.04]And it's time for the second-to-last fight of the game.
[345:35.31]It's gonna be wild.
[345:36.83]I guarantee it.
[345:43.39]Yeah, people have a really, really, really great idea here.
[345:47.60]Well, Chad is doing this.
[345:49.40]You can write something.
[345:50.50]Somebody just wrote, said, hey, dude, when Chad is like this, I can tell you this.
[345:53.42]Huh.
[345:54.95]You get to chat to yourself.
[345:56.07]One person just did a full sentence, and I saw everything they wrote.
[345:59.63]Appreciate that.
[346:00.19]Thank you, by the way.
[346:19.49]Ow.
[346:19.67]Am I gonna finish this game tonight?
[346:24.15]Yes.
[346:27.90]After this, there's probably not much more after this next fight, because then I'll be going rank 1.
[346:35.80]There'll be probably one more sequence after this.
[346:41.09]And that will be it.
[346:42.91]Make sure you vote on the poll.
[346:45.07]You have until tomorrow afternoon Pacific, 12pm Pacific, to vote on that poll.
[346:52.09]Until it's closed.
[346:55.37]Ball is for the worst and best stuff that happened on this stream of the year.
[346:58.35]We did the same thing last year, we're doing it again.
[347:05.16]This one's gonna be a little more comfy than last year's, because I'm not gonna be in the studio this year.
[347:10.74]I'm gonna be hanging out right here, with a fucking suit on.
[347:13.78]Maybe a lar- maybe a pizza?
[347:22.26]Maybe a large pizza?
[347:27.98]Maybe I might have a couple glasses of wine.
[347:32.17]Right?
[347:33.13]That seems appropriate.
[347:33.81]It's going to be real, real comfy tomorrow.
[347:35.29]I'll tell you.
[347:35.71]Tomorrow's going to be one of those streams that you just... You know, if you're doing something for New Year's, hope you have fun.
[347:46.08]At least if you're on Easter time.
[347:47.34]Those of you that are just hanging out, put me on in the background of every party you go to.
[347:55.56]Make sure I'm the focus.
[347:58.48]Hanging out with your friends?
[347:59.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[348:00.08]Me, me.
[348:00.54]Best stuff that happened all year, remember?
[348:06.76]And turn me up to a point where everyone can hear me.
[348:16.49]And then you can all gather around the TV.
[348:20.53]And point and laugh.
[348:22.88]This way.
[348:23.38]Who is this guy?
[348:24.24]Everyone sit down for a second.
[348:25.16]Who is this?
[348:34.70]best worst noise of the year who put this on get this loser off who's having the worst noise of the year bro bro who put on this on TV whoever you are like I've but you're out
[349:04.83]Nah, but if you're just hanging out for New Year's... I'll be here.
[349:11.88]Until... after the ball drop Eastern Time.
[349:14.90]Maybe we'll have a couple drinks.
[349:19.40]Watch... over 20 different nomination videos.
[349:28.09]I'll eat some pizza.
[349:30.03]Do I have enough?
[349:36.17]Okay, I'm just going fishing for $3,000.
[349:38.13]Am I going to get hammered?
[349:43.31]No.
[349:44.71]I'm not going to get hammered.
[349:49.67]I do want to go back to the house, though.
[349:55.61]Where should I get a meat lover's pizza from?
[349:57.53]A chain?
[349:58.11]Or should I find a pizza place?
[350:00.17]Like a good Vegas pizza place.
[350:18.28]I'm not gonna make a pizza.
[350:29.28]Alright, I will get from a good pizza place.
[350:32.35]I'll find a good Vegas pizza place.
[350:36.73]I'll look up reviews, I'll find the best.
[350:39.25]And I will get it ordered.
[350:42.89]Where am I going?
[350:48.76]It has to be dominoes or the curse won't lift.
[350:52.06]No, I got that curse lifted.
[350:53.58]Remember I spun around three times in the chair last night and sung a song or screamed or whatever it was?
[351:00.23]That curse has been lifted.
[351:13.99]How many curses are on this stream?
[351:19.00]Okay, only two more of these.
[351:25.24]Alright.
[351:29.82]Just need a few more.
[351:32.90]One more and I can do rank two.
[351:34.94]There's one right here.
[351:46.91]Where is this?
[351:47.39]Is it behind here?
[351:48.52]Oh, no, that's a ball.
[351:52.76]How many balls do I have?
[351:53.64]Don't answer that.
[351:56.75]Don't...
[352:18.60]Dammit, I just want one more of these holes to dig.
[352:22.40]Here.
[352:30.81]Get it!
[352:31.07]500,000!
[352:31.09]It's time to pay the fee!
[352:37.55]F!
[352:37.71]Give me an F.
[352:50.42]I have zero drop frames.
[352:56.08]Are you guys resorting to baiting the guy that had traumatic experiences with the internet problems?
[353:04.33]And you're gonna pull that one on me?
[353:05.61]Oh my god.
[353:21.19]Alright, here we go.
[353:23.03]Rank two.
[353:36.56]What the?
[353:40.82]A letter.
[353:41.94]What do we got here?
[353:46.74]Don't come looking for me, Sylvia Crystal.
[353:50.41]Some trouble at home?
[353:51.95]She quit her job?
[353:54.46]What the hell is this all about?
[353:57.96]The rank two match will be at Destroy Stadium.
[354:01.30]Aren't I a hardworking girl?
[354:04.36]Buster!
[354:05.22]Not the baseball stadium again.
[354:08.48]Okay, Sylvia.
[354:09.86]Only two more to go.
[354:11.90]I'm going all the way.
[354:13.51]That's a promise.
[354:14.43]Destroy.
[354:15.87]Spar.
[354:17.77]Destroy.
[354:19.65]Cannon.
[354:31.21]Alright.
[354:32.27]Save the game.
[354:32.85]Make it happen.
[354:42.26]What are we at?
[354:43.28]10?
[354:43.30]11 in-game hours?
[354:43.86]12.
[354:46.08]Oh, this guy is really over the, uh... How long is No More Heroes average time to beat?
[355:04.73]To be fair, though, we did stop, like, three times.
[355:09.11]No, more than that.
[355:10.05]We paused a dozen times to look at Photoshops.
[355:14.75]Of this 12-hour playthrough... Maybe at least an hour of that has been... Flipping myself upside down and pretending that Twitch was upside down, right?
[355:29.12]Making 5G gum jokes that nobody liked.
[355:53.15]So I'm on pace.
[355:56.45]There's probably realistically another... I'm going to say there's probably like another 45 minutes left in the game.
[356:05.62]The only way that it's not is if it's like a million dollars that I have to grind to get to rank one.
[356:12.16]If that's the case, then, you know, it's going to take a little longer than that.
[356:26.00]How do I get in there?
[356:31.50]Whoa.
[356:36.49]Jump using... Are you talking to me?
[356:42.45]Why did it just want me to do that?
[356:56.22]Because it was cool, I guess.
[356:58.22]I mean, it was pretty cool.
[357:05.04]I gotta check how many balls I have.
[357:12.54]Another one right here.
[357:24.18]T-shirt.
[357:25.10]It's gonna replace the cat.
[357:25.98]I'm sorry.
[357:27.86]What is it?
[357:29.18]Just a tank top?
[357:31.54]Well, that's boring.
[357:35.99]It's just a black tank top.
[357:43.72]This is the Jerma look?
[357:45.06]Kind of is.
[357:47.96]Is that a jump pad?
[358:06.10]Bad girl.
[358:10.43]Bad girl.
[358:14.99]Uh, do I stay on this?
[358:22.67]Do I still run people over?
[358:36.99]Let's go!
[358:39.15]I should line him up, shouldn't I?
[358:44.46]He's hit and run all over again.
[358:45.96]There's no time limit here.
[358:52.97]That's not correct.
[359:09.88]How long do I have to do this for?
[359:22.39]10 minutes?
[359:22.91]No, I'm done.
[359:26.41]I want that though.
[359:28.02]I'm not muted!
[359:30.54]I'm not muted!
[359:43.33]I'm just gonna go in a circle.
[359:53.18]I can't fall off the bike, so who cares?
[360:11.42]That was a pretty good line.
[360:15.68]Remember, just shadowband me, what the fuck.
[360:28.81]You must be malding pretty hard to be this quiet.
[360:43.70]Why couldn't I drive the car?
[360:49.75]Was I supposed to fall off?
[361:04.87]Jesus.
[361:08.57]Okay.
[361:11.83]I hate the guys with guns.
[361:20.08]It's the worst.
[361:25.36]That's it.
[361:25.70]Give me that quick.
[361:28.18]Is it battery or is it health?
[361:35.99]It's battery.
[361:37.25]There's more of this shit?
[362:00.91]Who's left?
[362:03.73]We good?
[362:04.69]We're good.
[362:10.66]Alright, bring it on.
[362:24.56]Is soft locked?
[362:36.17]No.
[362:37.65]There's just another spawn over here that I didn't see.
[362:39.37]This guy will probably be it.
[363:00.66]And there's no one left.
[363:03.64]Very, very good.
[363:05.89]Where are we?
[363:15.60]There we go.
[363:18.84]Come here.
[363:41.74]He's the walker.
[363:42.98]A special for two guys, yeah.
[363:45.24]Alright, how much more do I have to do?
[363:49.42]I really do feel like this is a soft lock.
[364:12.79]Shouldn't have fall- There we go.
[364:14.06]I was gonna say, uh oh.
[364:17.60]You shouldn't have fallen off the bike.
[364:20.62]The bike was- Well, I got shot accidentally.
[364:35.64]Down there.
[364:36.08]18 hour boss fight incoming.
[364:39.61]Oh god.
[364:45.81]Want some sugar.
[364:47.05]Why do I always have to go to hell?
[364:53.85]That doesn't build much confidence.
[364:58.05]Hey, if you lose, you're going to hell, by the way.
[365:02.79]Come on.
[365:20.33]You tell me just tell me anything else If you lose you go to heaven lose and you will float up to heaven Those with guts at the glory with this your suplex rainbow the double wrist arm salt

[366:48.92]So fucking thirsty.
[366:51.72]Hold on a sec.
[366:54.68]She's not gonna drink somebody's blood, right?
[366:56.48]Damn that smooth.
[367:05.71]I feel alive again.
[367:09.41]Wanna drink?
[367:10.55]I'm telling you, you don't hear it, but it's in a lot of stuff.
[367:14.21]Why am I such an angry bitch?
[367:16.37]Seriously, no matter how many I kill, it's all the same.
[367:19.83]They're all going to pay.
[367:22.19]Yeah, with their fucking lives.
[367:24.83]You're a bad girl.
[367:27.63]You have no right to look at me like that.
[367:29.87]It's just a job.
[367:31.33]The daily grind.

[368:48.04]She didn't even do anything!
[368:49.56]It was a bait!
[368:50.40]I was waiting for it.
[369:08.67]Wrestling move, let's go!
[369:13.93]I tried to parry it.
[369:31.70]Look at her health.
[369:39.77]She's not even close.
[369:45.37]That was a good hit.
[370:03.57]Come on.
[370:04.49]This is gonna be long.
[370:05.87]I can't fuck this up.
[370:07.17]This is attrition.

[370:26.54]Hmm.
[370:27.06]Cool.
[370:33.90]Pretty cool Didn't even get a hit
[371:16.27]I could probably do the dark, uh, what that dark slide was called.
[371:27.01]Like that!
[371:46.62]I still don't understand that move.
[372:21.61]Ooh, that was a good combo.
[372:23.10]What are you doing?
[372:26.22]Holy shit, that did so much damage.
[372:28.66]That did so much damage.

[373:22.40]Don't startle the witch?
[373:28.01]Oh, fuck.
[373:39.78]I thought I could stop it.
[373:41.22]I can't stop it.
[373:41.78]I have to just fight them.
[373:51.49]Come on, give me a roll.
[373:52.91]Give me a super.
[373:53.73]Give me a bar, bar, bar.
[373:54.70]Let's see it.
[373:55.86]Dammit.
[373:57.46]Hit them back?
[374:04.80]We alright.
[374:07.62]I just kicked his...
[374:21.62]She just got accidentally comboed there, too.
[374:29.75]I think I learned that on accident one time.
[374:37.41]Hey.
[374:39.56]Did you?
[374:44.87]Oh no, she's taking out the booze.
[374:48.09]Phase two.
[374:49.81]She's way sloppier and way easier to hit.
[374:57.65]She's just gonna be stumbling around.
[374:59.11]Here we go.
[375:16.87]It's very poorly timed.
[375:18.53]It's very poorly timed.
[375:29.28]Target her.
[375:31.74]I thought I hit the table.
[375:41.88]What was that?
[376:08.97]See you later, number two.
[376:22.85]Ain't gonna take much longer.
[376:38.24]What the fuck just happened?
[376:40.46]She's doing it again!
[376:43.38]What happened?
[377:08.65]How do I get her off?
[377:09.27]How do I get her off?
[377:09.89]How do I get her off?
[377:11.01]How do I get her off?
[377:12.57]How do I get her off?
[377:14.97]How do I get her off?
[377:23.66]I'm dead?
[377:46.90]It wasn't greed.
[377:47.62]It wasn't.
[377:48.00]You know what?
[377:49.10]I was... Okay, listen.
[377:52.04]When I was holding the button down, I was going to wait for her to get up.
[377:54.48]I didn't go in the first time.
[377:56.38]No, I didn't.
[377:57.36]The first time she went down, I was like, oh, you don't go near the witch.
[378:00.00]I'm charging the charge, and I forgot that it just goes.
[378:05.81]It just swings after a certain amount of time.
[378:10.85]Ready, Lexi?
[378:11.75]One, two... It just does it.
[378:14.64]I forgot I was gonna hold it there until she stood up, and, you know, now we learn things, and we get a 17-hour boss fight.
[378:20.12]Here we go.
[378:22.66]Oh, that really sucks.
[378:44.44]Don't worry, I'll get there.
[378:48.48]We're gonna be here till Tonga's New Year.
[378:50.66]No, we will not.
[378:56.33]Just hug that right side.
[378:59.41]Oh, that hurt.
[379:01.37]I'm sorry.
[379:06.45]Hug that side.
[379:16.87]There we go, right?
[379:19.22]There we go.
[379:21.22]Well, very flashy.
[379:22.20]Very flashy.
[379:22.72]Too bad it didn't do anything.
[379:29.34]Can you imagine doing this with one of the weaker sabers and never upgrading your saber?
[379:39.84]This would actually take like four hours.
[379:52.66]Come on.
[380:00.88]More.
[380:01.42]More!
[380:12.78]Thank you, steak.
[380:17.74]Here she goes.
[380:20.08]She can do the thing.
[380:20.90]At least now I know.
[380:24.23]That I can knock him back.
[380:37.86]Come on!
[380:38.68]Halfway, almost.
[380:39.54]This is it.
[380:40.60]Alright, let me see if I can get this.
[380:44.26]That's one.
[380:48.64]Should I do it again?
[380:55.11]That's it.
[380:55.81]Bring it on.
[381:01.58]They can dodge like that, but it's okay.
[381:04.18]That's alright.
[381:08.94]Get away from me.
[381:20.98]I'm not taking any chances there.
[381:22.22]I'm not gonna... Fuck that.
[381:27.72]Quick!
[381:28.00]Well, she's vulnerable!
[381:33.84]Come here.
[381:43.49]What the fuck?!
[381:44.43]WHAT THE FUCK?!
[381:45.48]GET ME AWAY FROM THIS!
[381:52.78]Oh my god...
[382:09.98]He's terrified.
[382:10.78]Yeah, I don't want to do this a third time.
[382:23.65]Send it back.
[382:25.03]You got any more?
[382:37.20]Music's good.
[382:39.67]The music's pretty good in this whole game.
[382:42.15]It's very good.
[382:46.61]Could've dodged around that.
[382:55.82]Sorry, third time.
[382:59.56]Shit.
[383:04.18]How could you aim that way?
[383:05.32]I'm looking at her!
[383:15.92]I still have a heal back there that I can get, just don't get insta-killed.
[383:22.47]Alright, good.
[383:47.18]Will you lock on the... Jesus Christ.
[383:52.46]You know, I'm looking over here.
[383:53.44]I think I want to lock on to the person 180 degrees behind me.
[383:58.70]I think they're a little closer.
[384:10.73]What the fuck is going on?
[384:12.21]I'm trying to time it.
[384:26.39]Oh my fucking god, if I lose to this, my hand's going for the wall.
[384:40.44]What the fuck is going on?
[384:46.65]Go, do that frame by frame.
[384:48.47]I would like to see that slow down to a tenth of the speed.
[384:56.98]I'm getting this right now.
[384:58.36]Do it again.
[385:07.99]Why would you turn around and lock onto the person standing behind you?
[385:25.89]Huh!
[385:27.05]Huh!
[385:54.32]I'm not even going to go for it anymore.
[385:55.60]I'm not going to go for it.
[385:56.74]I'm not going to do it again.
[385:57.42]I'm just going to try to win.
[386:09.93]Dude, she was crying with two hands.
[386:11.52]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[386:14.06]Okay, this is it.
[386:40.76]Come on.
[386:57.41]Get outta here.
[386:58.35]Let me beat this.
[387:15.36]No, my health is so low.
[387:19.00]No.
[387:26.63]No, I'm not going in.
[387:27.73]No, I'm not going in.
[387:28.43]I don't care if it's free.
[387:29.95]I don't know.
[387:30.31]I can't be certain.
[387:30.95]I don't know if I can bait it or not.
[387:32.47]I can probably bait it.
[387:35.12]I got a freaking greasy finger right now.
[387:36.54]It's slipping off though.
[387:52.23]It's like a hippie raid!
[388:24.80]I'm not going in, I promise.
[388:26.57]I'm just gonna beat her with pure swordplay.
[388:45.78]Don't you fucking kill me, you motherfucker!
[388:56.43]Get over here.
[388:57.49]Fight me.
[389:03.74]I didn't even... What?
[389:07.04]She didn't even... There wasn't even a time.
[389:09.34]There was no frame data.
[389:10.86]There was no frame data.
[389:12.50]That happened instantly.
[389:15.46]I thought I was going to get a chance to... I didn't get any frame data after that.
[389:19.83]Oh, fuck.
[389:22.46]It was instant.
[389:23.12]It was instant.
[389:24.40]The last time that happened, she hit it back, but it was like, bing, here it comes.
[389:28.94]What?
[389:32.91]Oh, come on.
[389:35.37]What the fuck?
[389:44.83]There's no there's no frame usually just like the frames that she has like six or seven eight frames It didn't happen that time.
[389:52.60]It's happened every time There's no frame data
[390:16.64]Where's the fucking frame data on that one?
[390:17.74]Where's the frame data?
[390:50.29]Come on, get over here.
[390:51.19]I'm not doing this a fucking fourth goddamn time.
[391:04.10]Yeah, just don't hit it back there on the fire phase.
[391:05.60]Don't hit it back at all.
[391:10.12]I tried to dodge.
[391:34.24]I'm not doing this again.
[391:35.10]No way.
[391:35.28]Not in a million years, I'm not doing this again.
[391:52.91]Wow, you're trying so hard right now, Travis.
[391:57.63]Yes.
[391:58.97]I'll get it.
[392:06.62]I can, like, feel how hard I'm pressing the buttons.
[392:12.71]Shit, I tried to... Fuck.
[392:24.06]I messed it up.
[392:32.65]What did I just do?
[392:33.51]I have no idea what just happened.
[392:35.71]I stood like a fucking cartwheel.
[392:41.60]Come on, I need this, I need this, I need this, I need this!
[393:12.57]Get that fire going.
[393:13.47]I still have a full health over there.
[393:24.05]Alright, here we go.
[393:25.59]Fire!
[394:23.71]I don't have it why did I not do it oh don't hit it back well
[394:53.18]Oh shit.
[394:54.12]How do you like that dodge?
[395:05.55]Huh?
[395:05.79]How do you like THAT dodge?
[395:07.99]How many times are you gonna do this shit?
[395:46.36]It's almost time!
[395:55.93]What am I doing?
[396:12.23]This is it.
[396:12.87]Final fight.
[396:13.73]Final swings.
[396:16.29]Watch the standing there.
[396:34.77]I'm not choking.
[396:35.61]I'm not choking.
[396:36.47]I'm fine.
[396:39.03]God damn it.
[396:59.91]Attack!
[397:01.83]What the fuck?
[397:05.69]I have to do it?
[397:12.67]Do I actually have to do that?
[397:16.54]Oh no, okay.
[397:17.50]I have to hit back and forth, back and forth.
[397:21.80]Without any frame data.
[397:44.30]I win I win I win
[398:20.57]Fuck out of here.
[398:22.59]You're dead.
[398:23.01]You're dead.
[398:23.69]Die.
[398:24.49]Just die.
[398:24.89]This is it.
[398:28.61]This is it.
[398:32.57]How the fuck did I miss that?
[398:37.88]What's up with my throat?
[398:40.66]I'm good.
[398:55.50]Naughty girls need spankings.
[398:57.88]Maybe you forgot.
[398:59.22]I'm a bad girl.
[399:00.38]I will never lose.
[399:04.96]I give up.
[399:06.91]You win.
[399:07.85]Yes, I've won.
[399:33.24]The laugh.
[399:37.16]That was ridiculous.
[399:43.16]Alright, $330,000.
[399:44.64]Good.
[399:46.82]No snake outfit.
[399:47.58]We're going right to the last rank.
[399:54.77]I think that's the last health increase we can get.
[400:03.36]Nothing else, right?
[400:11.54]On behalf of Sylvia Crystal, I am here to tell you that you are now officially ranked second.
[400:19.86]Thanks.
[400:20.88]That was a close one.
[400:22.67]Almost didn't make it.
[400:24.27]It was a fine fight, sir.
[400:27.27]Shit, that was close.
[400:28.55]So what is it?
[400:29.05]Is the last fight between Ornstein and Smough here?
[400:46.11]Marvelous!
[400:54.97]Upgrade the sword?
[400:55.71]First let's see how much money it takes.
[401:11.64]So all those minus twos and plus twos are referring to frame data.
[401:18.55]What were people trying to tell me?
[401:19.71]To save a few extra frames or add a few frames?
[401:21.73]I saw a lot of add some frames.
[401:29.22]I didn't need to lose frames.
[401:30.22]I don't know why everyone's saying that.
[401:31.44]I didn't need to do it early.
[401:32.22]It's kind of stupid.
[401:34.86]It's weird.
[401:35.22]Why is people saying that?
[401:37.18]Hi.
[401:37.58]We're sorry to inform you that your video membership will be revoked until you return one of our videos.
[401:44.70]It's titled French Made Cafe...
[401:47.74]To number one.
[401:48.60]$550,000.
[401:49.34]That's a lot of money.
[402:15.68]Is there any more jobs?
[402:17.08]No, there's two more, right?
[402:21.53]There must be two more assassin jobs then to round out 20.
[402:46.42]Jerma, time is running out.
[402:47.28]It's almost 8 p.m.
[402:48.12]in Tonga.
[402:53.05]Uh... We ain't gonna see that.
[403:00.95]A new... There's a new job?
[403:02.59]What's the new part-time job?
[403:08.84]What else... Is something after Scorpion?
[403:32.09]It's almost the end of the year.
[403:33.17]Almost.
[403:34.75]Almost.
[403:35.57]Not quite, though.
[403:38.67]2020 is right around the corner.
[403:41.03]Almost here.
[403:48.82]You owe us the germapillow.
[403:50.74]Yeah, but... Alright, can that be, like, an early 2020 thing?
[403:53.46]I have to actually have one made.
[403:55.56]I'm not buying, like, a $500 one on Redbubble, whatever this thing is called.
[404:06.99]Alright, what's the job?
[404:16.53]Bike jump.
[404:17.29]Jump your bike off the point.
[404:18.95]Try to fly as far as possible.
[404:20.71]Is this game on Steam?
[404:24.25]This is not on Steam.
[404:35.19]This is for Wii and PlayStation 3.
[404:40.11]Xbox if you live in Japan.
[404:45.49]This is the original No More Heroes.
[404:52.42]The PS3 version sucks is what I've been told a bunch of times.
[404:55.54]I've been told it's not great.
[405:00.98]I also was told that the PS3 version of this game...
[405:05.75]For some reason, maybe they just didn't think they were ever going to remake the second game.
[405:10.86]But didn't they put, like, five or six of the bosses from No More Heroes 2 in the game as just random bosses you can fight afterwards?
[405:19.74]So... Kind of a... I'd rather just play the second one.
[405:30.97]No culture here.
[405:31.55]Nothing but dropouts.
[405:32.47]And even dropouts can create their own culture.
[405:34.89]Ride those waves, dropouts.
[405:36.55]Race those bikes.
[405:38.46]But the biggest dropouts of all, they jump.
[405:40.48]A good jump will jump start your future.
[405:42.34]It's a world that only those who experience it can understand.
[405:45.42]A wide and wonderful world.
[405:46.40]The god of jumping awaits you.
[405:47.44]Jump long and jump hard.
[405:49.80]Speed up and jump from the ramp on the point.
[405:52.24]Perform a well-timed wheelie jump to jump further.
[405:54.44]I have time?
[406:01.49]No, there is a time limit.
[406:08.05]Is it just straight ahead?
[406:11.94]Where is it?
[406:12.30]How far down the road is it?
[406:25.12]Here we go.
[406:33.32]That's pretty fucking far.
[406:36.59]Okay, I just jumped out of the world.
[406:38.59]I jumped out of the invisible... I went past the barrier.
[406:40.71]50,000?
[406:46.99]50k for like 10 seconds.
[407:02.16]Let's see what the last two assassin missions are.
[407:04.50]Yeah, that's insane money for no time at all.
[407:09.36]I'll just do that like five times.
[407:15.57]What is the final mission?
[407:29.93]Kill without taking a single hit from the enemy.
[407:32.05]10,000 per kill.
[407:35.60]Holy shit.
[407:38.00]That's a lot.
[407:39.36]Kill all the enemies with the time limit.
[407:40.76]You'll face cloned humans.
[407:45.56]Ugh.
[407:49.02]That's something I shouldn't even attempt it.
[407:52.58]Why is this one good?
[407:55.46]Kill all the enemies within the time limit.
[408:01.82]I mean, this is the final one.
[408:02.74]Might as well do it.
[408:10.13]10k per kill, but you can't get hit.
[408:12.21]And it's probably 3 minutes.
[408:14.55]So if you figure you have to not get hit for 3 minutes, sure, you might make $500,000, but you can't get hit for 3 minutes.
[408:31.41]Shit, I haven't peed in seven hours.
[408:32.73]I probably should do that.
[408:52.52]Yeah, after this, after this, I'm gonna go grab some water.
[408:57.13]And...
[409:03.02]Yeah, I'm just gonna hydrate, take a pee, and we'll come back and we'll finish up the game.
[409:10.12]After this, though.
[409:17.64]Mission start.
[409:19.68]So this is baseball?
[409:30.16]Is it baseball?
[409:33.51]Wait, is it not baseball?
[409:35.57]Oh, no, it's just... No!
[409:38.68]Did you hear that audio?
[409:45.34]Too much blood.
[409:58.64]He's not going to pee till next year in Tonga.
[410:01.00]That would be something now, wouldn't it?
[410:07.58]Ooh, that audio.
[410:25.59]That's pretty crunchy.
[410:28.45]Did I do it?
[410:30.77]30 kills.
[411:02.30]That's really good, too.
[411:06.48]It takes... That's one minute for 90,000.
[411:14.80]That's probably... That's probably better than... Yeah, that's more reliable than the bike.
[411:25.23]What is it?
[411:25.53]550?
[411:25.63]Okay.
[411:28.39]I also need to... Let me check the shop.
[411:32.60]The sword shop.
[411:33.44]I also have to upgrade my body.
[411:39.71]Yeah, talk to the ball guy.
[411:40.77]Yeah, he's right next to the... Get it all done here.
[411:53.70]First, let's go check out the sword stuff.
[412:03.10]Actually, this is right here, isn't it?
[412:04.34]Yeah.
[412:04.66]Let's get this done.
[412:21.86]That dumpster is unopened!
[412:29.47]Bench press one more time, 60 point thousand.
[412:42.13]No.
[412:47.32]So here we are, 750 people at recording this video, 750 people have now subscribed to the channel.
[412:52.54]Thank you so much.
[412:53.88]It got deleted.
[412:54.48]It got deleted.
[412:56.90]Let me say it.
[413:19.46]And... Squats.
[413:40.55]I mean, I do appreciate little mini-games like this.
[413:42.97]Like, sort of San Andreas style.
[413:45.55]Of having open world and a gym.
[413:47.59]But I really wish that each one of these, you had to do them faster or something.
[413:52.73]It's the same minigame every time.
[413:57.78]It's so hard in No More Heroes, too.
[414:01.68]Yeah.
[414:10.84]I see the balls, too.
[414:14.20]That is, you're right, it is an unopened dumpster.
[414:17.14]Good catch.
[414:29.44]Giving up on the balls?
[414:30.16]I don't have enough.
[414:34.50]Shit.
[414:47.35]Do I need one more?
[414:52.62]The real question is, how much is the upgrade for the katana?
[415:16.20]If it's more than three or four hundred thousand, I don't think I'm going to do it.
[415:29.12]No balls if I don't do it.
[415:32.23]Something to drink.
[415:32.87]Alright, weapons.
[415:35.07]Parts.
[415:35.35]Well, that has to be a joke.
[415:43.35]999 a million beam katana energy saving part for sabaki mk3 set this into the heart of the motherboard inside the beam it's just infinite battery it will never have to be recharged okay you're right this one's power uh this I'm gonna do this one
[416:13.27]Yeah, this is the best one.
[416:19.53]It's expensive, but I'm going to get this one.
[416:29.98]One of the Jerma stream awards is going to actually take place.
[416:34.96]So the... Probably at...
[416:40.19]Oh, the stream is going to start around 6 Pacific.
[416:42.77]So around 9 p.m.
[416:43.85]Eastern is when it's going to turn on.
[416:46.21]I would assume we'll hang out for like 20-30 minutes.
[416:49.11]Relax, maybe go over some red bubble scams.
[416:55.82]And probably right around 6.30, I'd say.
[417:01.80]6.30, 6.30-ish, we'll probably start doing them.
[417:04.55]They won't take more than a couple hours, just like last year.
[417:07.45]But I want it to line up right when we do the last one.
[417:09.77]We can count the ball down.
[417:10.57]Alright, I'm going to do that mission again.
[417:14.24]That fighting one, because it was really, really good.
[417:31.94]For some reason, we were saying GTA, Grand Theft Auto, and I don't know why, you can run through every chain link fence in Grand Theft Auto, and this game became Grand Theft Auto for five seconds.
[417:42.02]I don't know why.
[418:01.58]Get out of the way.
[418:15.95]Did I just go across the bridge for no reason?
[418:21.81]I did, didn't I?
[418:26.19]I was in a giant goddamn circle.
[418:39.03]Wait, are we back in single-letter emote-only mode?
[418:46.45]I didn't even say anything.
[418:48.79]We're just doing it.
[418:49.47]This is 90k.
[418:55.85]Yeah, this is almost 100,000.
[419:00.55]Then after this, I'll do the bike jump, like, a few times.
[419:03.16]And we should be there.
[419:14.52]What do I got for money?
[419:18.20]250,000.
[419:18.46]I need 550.
[419:30.69]I do have increased power, though.
[419:31.69]Maybe I should try the gambling one again.
[419:39.94]Right?
[419:40.48]That sounds like a good idea, doesn't it?
[419:43.06]Doesn't it?
[419:49.85]In 20 years, I will return!
[420:06.79]I love you, David.
[420:09.32]I can't wait for that game to come out.
[420:10.76]That game's gonna... Hey, prediction?
[420:12.66]That game's gonna be one of the best games to come out in 2020.
[420:14.76]Prediction.
[420:28.79]Power up.
[420:33.54]Jerma, I'm on a joke withdrawal.
[420:35.08]I need a joke to fuel my addiction.
[420:37.72]Don't be addicted to jokes.
[420:44.13]There's this two sides to the mask.
[420:45.51]There's comedy and tragedy.
[420:49.31]It's not comedy and comedy.
[420:53.31]By the way, those people just disintegrated.
[420:54.93]It can't even spawn.
[421:08.25]What you're asking for is the equivalent of picking out all the grain cereal in Lucky Charms.
[421:16.47]Not just only marshmallows, man.
[421:18.07]You can't just...
[421:30.50]You do that.
[421:31.66]Yeah, that's a mistake.
[421:43.62]I want to take this fully powered up sword into the gamble one.
[421:47.86]I could probably get 150,000 easy.
[422:00.75]What version is this?
[422:01.55]This is the original version being emulated through Dolphin.
[422:16.16]On his fake Wii.
[422:18.54]No, I'm... Every time.
[422:21.80]Every time somebody asks... It's been... I own it.
[422:27.51]It's behind me.
[422:40.80]Emulators are illegal.
[422:42.40]When the president does something, it's not illegal.
[422:50.88]Let's do a jump.
[423:11.94]How do I have the control set up in Dolphin?
[423:13.52]I have... It actually was... This... That's a great question, because anybody that's, you know, has, you know, owns a Wii and owns a copy of the game and emulates their own software.
[423:22.47]Um... The Wiimote is that... It's kind of finicky.
[423:30.37]And what I mean by that is I have... This is a Wii Motion Plus controller.
[423:35.05]But all Bluetooth is not made the same, apparently.
[423:38.79]And even if you think you have... Oh, yeah, I've got Bluetooth.
[423:41.47]It connects to your computer with Bluetooth.
[423:44.03]But even still, some Bluetooth dongles don't work with it.
[423:48.12]It can't sync them.
[423:50.90]I had an internal.
[423:52.64]I think it's actually the one that I had.
[423:53.84]It was a Qualcomm.
[423:55.98]It was the Bluetooth that I had, and it just wouldn't sync with it.
[424:01.00]The dongle that I have that works with it...
[424:03.93]is a Targus Bluetooth dongle.
[424:06.56]That's the one that... I'm using it right now.
[424:11.10]It's like a Targus 4.0 Bluetooth dongle.
[424:14.94]And it will sync if you have the original Wii Motion Plus controller.
[424:18.40]There's this one I have here.
[424:19.20]USB dongle.
[424:24.49]He's making up words.
[424:32.63]Don't use that word.
[424:33.47]That's what it's called.
[424:34.47]It's a dongle.
[424:37.05]It's a USB dongle.
[424:38.37]I mean, I guess technically it's a USB Bluetooth adapter, but it's a dongle.
[424:48.93]That's what it is.
[424:55.49]And what you do is in the settings in Dolphin there are...
[424:59.08]Obviously, ways to connect directly to a real Wii mode.
[425:01.72]They have it built into the software, so it's pretty good.
[425:06.46]And again, for some of the new viewers that might be here, just going, oh, hey, he's... What's he doing?
[425:11.90]He's emulating this?
[425:12.72]Hold on, let me just fucking destroy this.
[425:17.00]This game notoriously runs terribly on the Wii.
[425:24.40]And the PS3 version is not the version that I wanted to play.
[425:35.22]When you have more than a few people on the screen, especially when you do the blood splatter on three or four people at the same time, it can drop down to less than 10 frames a second.
[425:45.31]Also, all the open world stuff on the original Wii is painful.
[425:51.47]Riding the motorcycle around town is... It chugs.
[425:56.77]Chug, chug, chug.
[425:57.94]And it runs at like 480p.
[425:59.80]So...
[426:04.20]That's why I've decided to do this.
[426:12.92]How much money do I have?
[426:17.52]339.
[426:17.54]Alright.
[426:18.44]The gambling mission will take care of this.
[426:21.06]And then it's time for the end of the game.
[426:22.68]Save your excuses for the judge.
[426:35.07]17, right?
[426:35.71]Uh, 18.
[426:36.43]You can do the secret ending?
[426:45.48]Um, maybe.
[426:45.94]Maybe.
[427:07.25]How much longer?
[427:07.81]I don't think I've ever seen the Secret Egg.
[427:09.45]Is it, um... Is it much longer after the game?
[427:18.66]Or is it something I have to grind out for a while?
[427:20.94]For more than a couple hours?
[427:31.36]Go pee, or I'm gonna do it... Oh, right, okay.
[427:34.41]I'll do it after this.
[427:36.93]Let's see if this... If I don't get over 80 on this, then I'm gonna be very upset, because I have the maximum power upgrade.
[428:00.82]I tried to do it.
[428:04.31]I waved.
[428:04.65]Just didn't pick it up.
[428:06.25]What the fuck?
[428:09.75]Dude, go pee.
[428:11.71]I'm gonna be... I'm fine.
[428:44.77]No, no, no, no, no.
[428:47.28]It's over.
[429:08.02]Battery.
[429:09.70]There we go.
[429:15.38]Alright, that's good.
[429:18.74]You all dead?
[429:20.00]Alright, line it up.
[429:48.58]I'm 42.
[429:49.08]I can do better than that.
[430:03.51]How tired is my arm?
[430:05.75]You know, before you said that, I didn't notice this.
[430:09.22]But now I do notice that my arm hurts.
[430:12.82]I've noticed that now my arm does hurt.
[430:16.62]I've been kind of doing these motions for the last two straight days.
[430:35.41]There's too much P building up.
[430:36.83]Imagine if that were real.
[430:45.04]Line it up.
[430:47.92]Yes!
[430:49.78]I might get over 100 if I'm good.
[431:04.30]Not that long.
[431:05.40]I'm not gonna... Is this too late for 100?
[431:10.84]Not even 88.
[431:11.26]126.
[431:13.34]I'm almost there.
[431:37.23]It's getting late, too.
[431:37.95]What is it?
[431:40.47]2 a.m.
[431:41.45]Eastern.
[431:49.40]5.24.
[431:49.54]Alright.
[431:51.40]One more bike jump.
[431:56.26]I'll pee.
[431:56.56]Don't worry.
[431:56.84]I'm going to pee before I get to the last area.
[432:08.01]Yeah, it's two.
[432:15.87]We'll probably finish up.
[432:18.01]We'll finish up within the hour.
[432:20.35]I can't imagine how this whole area and another boss will take more than a full hour.
[432:26.67]I don't think so.
[432:27.39]I don't think so.
[432:34.97]I need to do the jump one more time.
[432:44.21]That'll be 50k.
[432:49.96]Therma's dongle doesn't work like it used to.
[433:02.47]Nice.
[433:03.83]Nice.
[433:06.51]Good.
[433:07.55]Good one.
[433:16.20]Why would I read that?
[433:16.86]Because my brain is a scrambled egg and just says things out loud.
[433:21.64]I don't know why it just does that.
[433:36.63]Nothing to compare to the dream sequence from seven hours ago.
[433:45.92]Will Jerma read anything that's highlighted?
[433:47.84]Pretty much.
[433:51.40]Yeah.
[434:17.79]Yeah, I tried to hit that person and it was bad for me.
[434:33.51]Nancy Drew games have shovelware knockoffs of Professor Layton games.
[434:38.49]I have some really bad news for you.
[434:40.55]The Nancy Drew series predates Professor Layton by about... probably 25 years.
[435:00.14]Nancy Drew and the Golden Shoe came out in... what, like 1996?
[435:07.85]That was a bad one.
[435:08.51]1982.
[435:14.91]Yeah.
[435:15.13]At least the Layton games are actually fun.
[435:35.39]I've played the Layton games.
[435:37.13]At least one of them.
[435:38.88]Whatever one they ported to the iPad, I've played it.
[435:40.68]That's not a real Layton game?
[435:55.96]How is it not?
[436:00.38]Whatever the first one is.
[436:01.18]Professor Layton in the Golden Shoe.
[436:06.72]It's one of the first ones.
[436:18.04]Why didn't I call this number in the first place?
[436:22.37]Uh, hello?
[436:25.65]Hello?
[436:26.95]May I ask who's calling?
[436:28.81]This is the Assassin's Association, right?
[436:31.66]Look, I gotta talk to you about... Oh, dear.
[436:34.78]she's done it again hasn't she hey are you listening excuse me for asking but are you by chance an assassin whoa don't tell the whole world then you have been had sir you are not her first it's a fake association run that by me again listen to me do not get involved whatever you do
[436:57.75]Listen, lady, I don't know what the hell you're talking about.
[437:00.81]Who are you anyway?
[437:02.23]Another sorry kid.
[437:04.24]But here's the thing.
[437:04.88]And for the record, I am Sylvia's mother.
[437:07.00]If it's a fake association, and you've convinced a hundred people that they're part of an assassin association, and you have rankings, and they actually are ranked, isn't it real?
[437:20.13]She is a professional con artist.
[437:23.35]You mean a fraud?
[437:24.97]Are you telling me this was all just bullshit?
[437:27.45]She set everything up.
[437:29.37]Would you mind telling me how far this all went?
[437:32.69]Real fake assassins.
[437:35.15]So, just one more to go.
[437:37.53]Alrighty.
[437:39.05]Why not play along since you've come this far?
[437:41.85]Are you serious?
[437:43.03]What's the point?
[437:44.07]This is all some make-believe charade.
[437:46.27]But a good man finishes what he started.
[437:49.35]Fight to the end.
[437:50.79]Your most formidable opponent awaits in the castle.
[437:54.46]now off to the garden of madness oh yeah the entry fees she's collecting entry fees from those 11 12 15 20 potential people we still have to kill each other and we've agreed that that person is higher in rank than us so we have actually just made an assassins league
[438:28.24]let's just sure the entry fee makes no sense cut out the middleman
[439:00.60]Alright, Jean, this is the last time I'm going to be able to play with you.
[439:03.00]Okay.
[439:16.95]Let's look at the cards for the last time.
[439:20.57]Cool.
[439:23.34]Missed a couple.
[439:25.44]Ooh, I like this one.
[439:28.48]And this one.
[439:30.48]and that's it what looks like Darth Vader
[440:01.79]Good thing I've got the dash.
[440:14.62]Call the bike?
[440:15.60]Uh... No, my friend has had enough of my shit.
[440:29.27]This is dumb, though.
[440:30.99]What's the point of doing this?
[440:35.27]There really is no point in this segment here.
[440:40.07]It's just... This is kind of annoying, that's all.
[440:45.46]Oh, I gotta... How far away is that?
[440:57.90]How far away is this?
[440:58.66]Is it worth doing?
[441:03.17]It's right there.
[441:03.79]Alright, it's right here.
[441:05.31]And then I'm gonna pee, I promise.
[441:26.21]Which one should I get?
[441:32.21]A ball!
[441:34.21]Let's teach.
[441:35.35]Techniques.
[441:38.89]Displays the position of... Somebody said hold C to make it go faster?
[441:43.60]It's not working.
[441:47.18]Position enemies.
[441:49.52]Allow you to jump and slash.
[441:52.90]Cool.
[441:53.30]Okay.
[441:54.58]Extends your dark side.
[441:55.90]No.
[441:56.08]No.
[441:58.18]Increases the range of your grab.
[442:01.55]That's pretty good.
[442:04.57]Earn bonuses based on... No.
[442:06.69]Too late in the game.
[442:09.09]Allows a jumping down attack.
[442:13.58]Probably this one.
[442:17.58]Grab range is good.
[442:18.54]Jump slash might be good too.
[442:24.24]Jumping slash... Yeah, let's do it.
[442:28.10]Technique of love.
[442:37.90]Mm-hmm.
[443:00.88]I'll be right back.
[443:02.65]And we will finish up the game.
[446:25.77]I almost picked up the Xbox controller.
[446:41.57]Everyone scatter, he's here!
[446:48.01]Did I get extra dust?
[446:50.17]Why does this feel extra dusty?
[447:08.46]Come on.
[447:35.09]I know what it's like when my mic is muted.
[447:39.91]I can see it.
[447:41.11]It's right in front of me.
[447:51.08]Okay, here we are.
[447:53.98]Fight number one.
[447:56.36]Welcome to my castle.
[448:11.16]Dark Star.
[448:15.74]A driving segment.
[448:18.44]Why am I thinking of Sonic the Hedgehog?
[448:23.20]No, don't collect the boxes, okay?
[448:31.83]Can you punch?
[448:39.43]I didn't even touch that guy.
[448:41.55]He ran into a box, I told you.
[448:43.47]Don't run into the boxes.
[448:44.89]I know the secret.
[448:56.30]I know the secret.
[448:57.76]Don't drive near me.
[449:16.53]Alright, that guy got by.
[449:17.41]That's fine.
[449:27.70]How can you be fast- I have turbo boost.
[449:31.12]Did I get him?
[449:36.21]What if I just go like this?
[449:40.37]What if I- I'm just gonna block the road.
[449:46.54]I'm just gonna block the road.
[449:59.10]I can't.
[450:00.12]I can't stop.
[450:19.72]That's so funny.
[450:20.48]Not enough time.
[450:26.55]Alright, I didn't even jump, it's fine.
[450:29.47]You can't lose.
[450:44.02]Well, that's a problem between you two, not me.
[450:59.39]I'm gonna land on top of you.
[451:00.82]I'm gonna land on top of you.
[451:01.66]The hell was that me?
[451:15.77]Is the old... is the old lady back with her plasma cannon?
[451:22.69]There's no way I was gonna jump that.
[451:24.81]Take the damage.
[451:35.37]Shit, I have to jump this.
[451:41.14]I've got to try and speed up!
[452:05.84]Always look behind you.
[452:14.76]I'll get it eventually.
[452:21.09]It's the ghost of my teacher.
[452:23.71]Go that way.
[452:24.99]Nope.
[452:26.44]I'm going this way.
[452:34.42]Well, I got extra health.
[452:35.56]This is a maze- this is a maze segment, isn't it?
[452:52.39]Hey, at least we got to see the title of the stream one more time.
[453:17.23]Oh my god, Freddy!
[453:20.16]Fred!
[453:22.28]Freddy!
[453:27.00]Another 40,000 bits from Freddy Dredd.
[453:37.26]That... 75,000 bits earlier, 23,000 the night before, and that... subs and... Freddy, holy fuck.
[453:48.18]Freddy says, beat it faster.
[453:54.71]Which way am I supposed to go?
[453:59.99]Alright, Freddy, I'm gonna try.
[454:04.57]You have to beat it for Tonga tonight.
[454:11.83]Well, seriously, Freddy, that's... That is a ridiculous amount of money.
[454:18.24]Look at the... Open up the thing above the chat.
[454:21.74]Look at how many bits that is.
[454:25.63]Fucking $1,115 in bits.
[454:35.33]Use it to buy a pillow.
[454:36.57]Oh, don't worry, I will.
[454:50.09]Why do I hate Tunga?
[454:54.13]I'm not staying up for like... Look, hey, I got a big stream to plan and get ready for tomorrow.
[455:06.55]How about doing a 24-hour stream?
[455:11.00]I got a big pizza-eating stream to do tomorrow.
[455:17.62]I think he was pointing this way, actually.
[455:37.66]A big stream, yeah, in your office... forehead.
[455:40.62]In your- yeah, in your OFFICE forehead.
[455:53.79]There's no- I don't know why that's funny, it just is.
[456:01.13]Okay, that- you can't quite...
[456:07.21]Jesus!
[456:07.97]How do I do the jump slash?
[456:13.11]Oh, there it is.
[456:41.02]Oh, that's completely broken.
[456:42.58]You just flick the nunchuck.
[456:44.44]And it can kill people instantly.
[456:51.23]Tonga's disappointed.
[456:53.39]Why?
[456:53.69]I didn't do anything.
[457:05.46]Beat it faster.
[457:06.30]There's only so fast I can go!
[457:10.29]I'm going as fast as I can.
[457:11.31]Is he alive?
[457:19.38]He doesn't look like a ghost here.
[457:35.27]to say travis that path of men is not path of beasts you know you know uh your edge can be poisoned or cured to be learned as the path and to be ignorant is also the path your path your path is that path that no one nothing can pass yet the path reach on devotion is only given to those who perfect single thing reward them no reward those who do not perfect
[458:02.40]Does a reward or just evil lie down your path?
[458:06.28]Fight until you die, Travis.
[458:08.55]Thunder Ryu.
[458:16.33]And I left my In the Laminate Mickey Mantle trading card in there for you.
[458:25.14]It's worth like four million dollars.
[458:26.98]Travis, can you hear me?
[458:29.80]It's Sylvia.
[458:31.52]I never thought you'd make it this far.
[458:35.04]But I am sorry.
[458:36.84]I cannot see you anymore.
[458:38.60]I want to fly to your side right now.
[458:42.82]I want to be in your arms.
[458:44.92]I want to be with you.
[458:46.60]I want to share my life with you.
[458:49.24]No matter the cost.
[458:51.80]Meeting you, I felt truly alive for the first time.
[458:55.74]I mean that.
[458:58.75]but feelings and reality are two different things.
[459:02.96]Life is not that simple, yes?
[459:05.88]Now, be honest.
[459:08.46]Did you really think I would let you do me if you hit number one?
[459:14.31]You really are an idiot, aren't you, Travis?
[459:17.47]Come back to reality.
[459:19.97]I mean, look at yourself.
[459:22.70]You are a dopey otaku assassin.
[459:25.46]The bottom of the barrel.
[459:26.54]Dopey.
[459:27.76]No woman would be caught dead with you unless she was a desperate bitch.
[459:34.02]Where in the world could you find a woman who could fall in love with someone like you?
[459:39.69]Well, one is right here.
[459:44.17]It was fun, Travis.
[459:47.03]I love you.
[459:49.45]Now.
[459:50.88]Don't forget to use the restroom.
[459:54.82]Trust your force and head for the Garden of Madness.
[460:01.41]Okay.
[460:02.25]Thanks, Sylvia.
[460:03.61]But I'm at Walmart.
[460:04.53]Do we need toilet paper?
[460:06.41]I just... That's what I'm calling you.
[460:10.21]Jesus.
[460:10.57]Shoot!
[460:16.91]Shoot!
[460:21.29]Mod log to me every time I call you on the phone Here we go, you're in a Shrek outhouse I
[460:43.65]I wonder what the reaction in this chat would be if Shrek was the last boss.
[460:48.99]Somehow they made it happen.
[460:50.35]And it was only in this game.
[460:51.37]It was just some weird coincidence.
[460:53.95]Two of the executives are best friends or something.
[460:56.15]And what would happen?
[460:56.87]What would people do?
[461:03.24]Like, you know how a snake made it into Smash Bros.?
[461:07.64]One of those scenarios.
[461:25.70]Funny green man.
[461:34.98]And it wasn't some kind of copycat voice actor.
[461:38.88]It was Mike Myers with original lines.
[461:49.44]Welcome to my castle.
[461:51.76]I heartily receive you, my son.
[461:55.72]Alright.
[461:56.64]Enough with the jokes.
[461:58.69]A joke?
[461:59.71]You don't remember me, Travis.
[462:01.87]I am your true father.
[462:03.79]Blood does not make such mistakes.
[462:10.51]Jeez, you are full of it, aren't you?
[462:27.36]It's a good story.
[462:28.60]I'll give you that much.
[462:31.08]That thing's really difficult to use.
[462:32.62]That's not practical.
[462:34.77]Even if you were my father, it doesn't matter.
[462:37.35]The only thing that matters here is who's best.
[462:40.99]Remember, son.
[462:42.59]Engraved into your memory is the night when everything changed.
[462:46.77]I fell to my feet right before my son's eyes.
[462:50.52]Do you not remember this?
[462:55.50]In my deepest memories, I hear someone calling.
[463:00.99]I remember.
[463:02.51]It was a hot summer day.
[463:04.43]There was someone standing behind my father and mother.
[463:07.64]That person killed my parents.
[463:10.10]The face, I can't make it out.
[463:12.42]Who are you?
[463:13.54]Remember.
[463:14.72]Who are you?
[463:16.20]Try harder.
[463:17.64]I think I can see it.
[463:20.52]Almost.
[463:22.69]Nerd neck.
[463:23.45]Recognized.
[463:24.23]Gamer posture.
[463:25.91]Now I remember everything.
[463:30.93]well done son she was the girl you loved alright for one second I thought his sword went all the way behind him and stabbed him through the pelvis because it was so unruly he couldn't I told you the weapon was bad at least not anymore you killed him didn't you
[463:57.26]Yes.
[463:58.52]And that's why you became an assassin.
[464:00.98]To kill me.
[464:02.68]Now I get it.
[464:04.10]All those fights.
[464:05.54]It was for this.
[464:08.95]I lost everything I ever cared about.
[464:11.89]That bitch took everything.
[464:16.21]I can help you to get even.
[464:20.07]She's a good con artist, that's for sure.
[464:22.45]She set up some killer fights.
[464:24.56]So you and I finally meet.
[464:26.75]You should thank Sylvia.
[464:29.37]Jean, there's just one thing I want to ask you.
[464:32.96]Who are you?
[464:35.13]Me?
[464:35.95]You don't need to know.
[464:37.29]All of your trivial questions will be answered in the afterlife.
[464:41.40]Answer me!
[464:42.92]It's impossible.
[464:44.30]Impossible?
[464:45.34]What do you mean?
[464:46.26]It's too terrible.
[464:47.56]It alone would Jack up the age rating of this game even further.
[464:51.20]So what?
[464:52.16]Who cares?
[464:53.34]What if the game gets delayed?
[464:54.67]You don't want this to become No More Heroes forever, do you?
[464:56.83]It's being emulated.
[464:57.99]It doesn't matter.
[464:58.89]Fast forward this so you can tell me.
[465:01.53]OK, I'll make it short and quick.
[465:04.64]This ain't no other way.
[465:08.77]Your father abandoned my mother to run off with your mother.
[465:11.31]It broke her heart to be unprepared.
[465:12.45]She killed herself.
[465:13.11]Knowing I had nowhere to go, she took advantage of me.
[465:15.11]Ever since I can remember, she molested me.
[465:16.43]We lived in this rotten apartment.
[465:17.79]And I was his slave.
[465:18.55]Every day I cursed his soul.
[465:19.41]I swore that I would kill him one day.
[465:20.95]But cursing didn't change anything.
[465:22.16]That's when I decided to become a killer.
[465:23.20]With no money to pay for training, I paid with my body.
[465:24.74]But to you?
[465:25.24]I thought that son of a bitch looked like a hard-working family man.
[465:27.46]That was all an act.
[465:28.18]He didn't give two shits about cleaning up my life.
[465:29.86]So I decided to clean it up myself.
[465:30.98]That's why I do what I do.
[465:31.70]So I got what I wanted.
[465:32.56]During
[465:33.91]No, it's not an emu- it's not an emulation error.
[465:37.21]Actually, maybe it is.
[465:42.08]Oh no.
[465:44.38]Maybe it had to be done.
[465:46.26]But vengeance begets vengeance.
[465:49.30]I hope it doesn't stay like this.
[465:55.26]All of your sorrows end today, Jean.
[466:25.72]I have to skip this cutscene.
[466:27.04]Alright, we saw the... It's alright.
[466:34.51]It's not saved right before this.
[466:35.61]It's alright.
[466:36.03]It's fine.
[466:37.35]Hold on.
[466:40.29]The emulation.
[466:41.01]Oh.
[466:41.92]Oh, wait.
[466:42.92]We got a... This is actually pretty great.
[466:50.08]I've got a big error code on the screen.
[466:51.45]It says, one of the following may have happened.
[466:54.21]The emulated GPU got desynced.
[466:59.21]Disabling dual core.
[467:02.65]That's true.
[467:03.67]And the emulator... Okay.
[467:10.47]Whoa.
[467:12.48]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[467:14.72]We're good?
[467:30.56]Wait, wait, wait.
[467:30.98]Did I hit the dragon or hit her?
[467:38.94]Weird timing.
[467:39.54]Alright, there's weird timings on that shit.
[467:44.54]Fuck, what's that?
[467:48.39]Oh, this hurts.
[468:12.54]She's fucking fast!
[468:34.83]Can't dodge that, but he fucking swings it up, bro!
[468:40.59]No way!
[468:57.93]Oh shit!
[469:34.41]Just hit her!
[469:35.01]What do you think I'm trying to do?
[469:48.10]What's going on?
[469:51.10]I'm the last one.
[469:54.34]Phase 2, now I have to fight the dragon too.
[469:55.90]Hold on, I need... Give me this.
[470:04.18]Wow, you just... out of nowhere.
[470:10.41]Dammit.
[470:24.94]Ow, my sand slipped off the Wiimote.
[470:42.24]Too fast!
[470:42.78]It's too fast!
[470:44.32]It's too fast!
[471:04.21]She just beat me!
[471:05.23]Unbelievable.
[471:25.05]Shit!
[471:25.61]Try to dodge it.
[471:35.33]Alright, phase three.
[471:38.47]Let's go.
[471:39.11]Phase three.
[471:39.55]Phase three.
[471:40.15]Do it!
[471:41.63]What do you got?
[471:42.03]More moves?
[471:42.94]You ain't got nothing on me.
[471:47.71]Making it tighter, I get it.
[471:49.72]Shit, that hurts.
[472:02.03]Swing!
[472:05.09]Swing!
[472:35.48]Oh, you motherfucker.
[472:40.76]Oh, motherfucker, my hands are falling off the Wiimote.
[472:43.38]It's so sweaty.
[472:51.97]Jeremy, you're never gonna start for the Red Sox today.
[472:56.15]Stop making me laugh.
[473:04.05]Jerma, you're never gonna start for the Red Sox, please!
[473:32.97]Why can't I hit you, you bitch?
[473:34.93]Why?
[473:36.03]Why?
[473:36.81]Why?
[473:37.33]Yes!
[473:51.44]Yes!
[473:53.54]Huh?
[473:54.70]Shake the Wii boat, shake!
[473:56.16]Shake the Wii boat!
[474:00.87]What?
[474:02.96]Don't you... What the fuck is happening?
[474:06.70]Okay, is this supposed to be... This is scripted, right?
[474:08.49]It's scripted.
[474:13.39]Oh, no.
[474:18.47]It's scripted.
[474:18.97]Good.
[474:21.33]Do it.
[474:22.64]Right.
[474:24.84]Brother, please don't kill me.
[474:27.58]Sorry, Jean.
[474:28.78]This hurts me too.
[474:30.79]We're both in the same business, after all.
[474:33.17]No, we both got conned by the same person.
[474:35.79]I had enough.
[474:38.94]Time for you to rest, Jean.
[474:41.36]Good night, Travis.
[474:44.34]I hope your next dream is a more pleasant one.
[474:57.19]It's over.
[474:58.81]This is where it all ends.
[475:02.12]You're never gonna start with a Red Sox.
[475:08.20]Can you imagine a popular Red Sox starting pitcher streaming on Twitch with the Wii mode and he just throws his arm out the day before a big game?
[475:19.27]Oh, that's so funny.
[475:24.97]I gotta beat this normal heroes, man.
[475:27.65]It's so much fun.
[475:30.48]My arm is killing me though.
[475:32.82]I'm gonna have to ice it.
[475:50.31]Dark Star.
[475:55.72]Don't forget the bonus boss I want.
[476:06.12]Different music, too.
[476:06.86]Freddy tried to get another 22,000 bits and says, go faster.
[476:13.86]That was first try.
[476:20.58]I went faster.
[476:21.20]Are you going to do No More Heroes 2?
[476:30.23]Yes.
[476:32.97]Probably not immediately.
[476:36.06]exactly 14 hours at least two of those hours are spent looking at photoshops return to Santa destroy or view the view real ending I just can view the real ending
[477:08.00]Real ending.
[477:08.72]Okay.
[477:16.90]It's finally over.
[477:18.26]Holy shit, Dwayne can't see his dick or anything, right?
[477:21.31]What just happened?
[477:21.95]Did that guy get some privacy?
[477:23.97]At least when he's taking a dump?
[477:25.59]I'm afraid not.
[477:27.09]These fights don't work like that.
[477:29.31]It's time to die, Mr. First Rank.
[477:32.43]You gotta be shitting me.
[477:41.91]Oh, it's Henry.
[477:42.43]It's the Kylo Ren guy, yeah.
[477:45.42]There's another- alright.
[478:08.07]easy punish what the hell just right underneath that blade
[478:34.81]Grab him!
[478:35.33]What do you got, Henry?
[478:36.85]Ooh, that looked like a hurt.
[478:39.17]That's a move I've never seen before.
[478:41.63]Oh.
[478:41.69]What's this fucking thing doing?
[479:09.13]I had an opportunity, damn it.
[479:17.39]I missed it.
[479:18.93]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[479:47.46]Look at his health.
[479:56.75]Get away.
[479:57.25]See you later, Henry.
[479:59.83]Oh, fuck.
[480:00.93]I'm alright.
[480:16.03]Oh, I did it twice in a row, you motherfucker.
[480:48.00]Come on, Henry!
[480:49.84]Shit.
[480:50.30]I'm alright.
[481:15.80]Where the fuck am I?
[481:16.68]Where is he doing?
[481:17.28]He's doing the move!
[481:22.64]I need that left, that left shoulder.
[481:33.99]He's vulnerable on that left shoulder every time.
[481:35.73]Don't get stuck in the wall.
[482:02.94]Is there a battery box?
[482:10.93]Holy shit!
[482:11.51]I thought he was done.
[482:31.81]Again!
[482:32.93]Oh shit.
[482:33.69]He's gonna dash.
[482:58.12]Right next to the bike!
[483:24.39]Take him out!
[483:25.09]Come on, he's almost done!
[483:28.10]I almost dodged into that.
[483:28.94]Yeah, I almost did.
[483:29.58]See you later, Henry.
[483:34.94]Nice fight.
[483:37.72]You're dead.
[483:57.57]Ugh, dammit!
[483:58.85]That all you got, Travis?
[484:00.67]Don't make me laugh.
[484:02.27]Mind if I ask you something?
[484:04.21]Sure.
[484:05.11]Why the hell do you call me Travis?
[484:07.05]Travis, like you're my friend or something.
[484:09.19]Who the fuck do you think you are?
[484:12.11]You can't be serious.
[484:13.55]All this time you didn't realize.
[484:15.42]What are you talking about?
[484:16.80]It's my brother, right?
[484:17.80]It's my brother!
[484:18.36]Yeah, of course it is.
[484:19.22]What the hell?
[484:20.14]That's the craziest shit I've ever heard.
[484:22.28]Why would you bring up something like that at the very last minute of the game?
[484:26.91]They really threw it all away in the last 40 minutes here.
[484:51.62]Addressing the audience.
[484:52.61]Fast forwarding.
[484:53.15]I'm sorry for all the trouble my wife has caused you.
[484:55.27]Forgive her.
[485:10.66]She caused me some trouble, alright, but it helped me clear up a lot of things.
[485:15.41]Ah, you know how women are, especially my wife, a really big spender.
[485:20.01]Yeah, she knew my income wasn't enough, so every now and then she'd just disappear.
[485:25.59]She's a bad wife, but a good woman.
[485:29.12]What?
[485:30.50]Are you telling me that you and her... Oh, come on.
[485:34.88]But Chad is my brother.
[485:37.06]We're similar in many ways.
[485:43.49]You're right.
[485:44.02]Suddenly you being my brother doesn't sound so awkward.
[485:50.20]Let me ask you.
[485:51.46]How do you plan to put an end to all of this?
[485:54.50]Wait a second.
[485:55.42]You want me to tie up all these loose ends?
[485:57.58]I don't think so.
[485:58.28]You're the protagonist.
[486:00.20]I'm just a cool, handsome foil who happens to be your twin brother.
[486:04.49]I hate to say it, but it's your job.
[486:08.07]This is like a shitty Metal Gear Solid cutscene.
[486:11.29]That's it.
[486:11.85]Imagine looking out your window and seeing that, yeah.
[486:14.91]You look out your window and you see two guys just running by with lightsabers.
[486:42.26]Did they both die at the same time?
[486:44.35]Well, there's a No More Heroes 2, so I'm going to have to say I'm sorry.
[486:46.87]The answer is no.
[486:52.75]Don't skip.
[486:53.31]I'm not going to skip the credits.
[487:07.37]2 is not canon.
[487:14.38]I mean, yes it is.
[487:19.52]Three is not canon.
[487:21.62]Three is canon.
[487:22.60]They're all canon.
[487:25.78]Even the top-down one is canon.
[487:32.10]Doesn't the Travis Strikes Again set up the third game, in a way?
[487:41.66]I'm fairly certain there's introductions to people in there.
[487:44.74]Well, we're going to have to play it.
[487:47.04]Going to have to do it.
[487:52.24]Eventually.
[487:53.30]Before the new one comes out.
[488:06.77]Why would they preemptively make a numbered sequel non-canon?
[488:09.75]Yeah, that doesn't make any sense.
[488:16.89]Travis Strikes Again is a half a visual novel.
[488:26.74]Is it?
[488:28.44]I thought it was like a top-down bullet hell type game.
[488:35.90]But you still have a sword, but isn't it really twitchy and... It is top-down.
[488:45.92]play killer seven as well oh here you go here are the voice actors dd bradley baker told you it was the fish killer seven killer seven's on the GameCube right it's on Steam
[489:17.03]When did they put it on Steam?
[489:22.90]Oh, shit.
[489:23.48]Okay.
[489:24.42]Is it a good port or is it crappy?
[489:32.47]It's good?
[489:34.17]It's alright.
[489:34.79]It's good.
[489:35.19]Good port's pretty good.
[489:35.93]Alright.
[489:38.13]I'll play it.
[489:38.51]It's also on the Switch.
[489:53.17]It's not on the Switch.
[489:54.47]Oh.
[490:03.65]As far... wait.
[490:05.37]IIRC, the port is literally just Dolphin running the emulator.
[490:09.57]Is it really?
[490:13.05]That's pretty funny if that's true.
[490:16.74]It's not.
[490:21.36]It's not.
[490:21.70]That was the trailer.
[490:29.09]The footage they used for the trailer was dolphin footage, but the actual port isn't.
[490:33.56]Huh.
[490:37.38]That's crazy.
[490:49.67]Google's a powerful tool.
[490:51.21]Yeah, it is.
[490:54.11]Alright, everyone, here we go.
[490:56.73]Post credits.
[491:04.07]You like this painting, don't you?
[491:07.63]Let's go, Jean.
[491:12.43]Why is everybody named Jean?
[491:27.32]I know.
[491:28.18]Too bad there won't be a sequel.
[491:29.98]Yes, there will.
[491:39.78]Actually, it never was supposed to be a series.
[491:44.18]According to Suda, right?
[491:45.14]So didn't Suda say that this was supposed to just be a one-off thing and he was never supposed to make any other games?
[491:52.85]That's actually real.
[491:55.91]Actually!
[491:59.85]To be continued.
[492:00.71]Oh, shit.
[492:07.30]My Wiimote got disconnected.
[492:12.62]Hold on, I gotta sync this back up.
[492:20.55]Play the other ending.
[492:26.43]Can I see the other ending anywhere that's not on YouTube?
[492:41.96]Alright.
[492:47.00]Also, I think I've unlocked the hard... difficulty.
[492:52.80]Right.
[493:00.27]Sweet, mild, bitter.
[493:03.07]Extremely difficult.
[493:06.33]Many strong men await you.
[493:08.74]Perfect for beginners.
[493:11.86]Bitter.
[493:14.92]Has anything changed in New Game Plus?
[493:25.12]It's just harder.
[493:30.25]Everything has more health and does more damage.
[493:34.29]You keep your money and your katanas, so what do you spend your money on?
[493:46.21]On snakeskin.
[493:47.09]Oh, clothes, I guess.
[493:48.07]Sure.
[493:51.91]I'm just curious to how hard the default enemies are on the hardest difficulty.
[493:58.15]Well, not bad considering I have the best weapon available.
[494:13.17]But if I don't do New Game Plus, I actually can just start on Bitter, right?
[494:22.60]Yes, you can.
[494:23.24]Okay, cool.
[494:24.44]Alright.
[494:24.76]Well, that's going to be it.
[494:28.84]Kind of a long one tonight.
[494:31.48]Make sure you get your votes in for New Year's Eve, which is tomorrow.
[494:35.56]That stream is going to be starting very late.
[494:37.26]6 p.m.
[494:39.68]Pacific.
[494:41.86]We're going to start the festivity somewhere around 6.30.
[494:44.55]And we're going to count down the new year.
[494:52.98]Does anybody want to link in the... I think I got it right here.
[494:57.88]There it is.
[494:58.26]That SurveyMonkey link.
[495:02.77]You can vote on some of your least favorite and favorite things of the year.
[495:10.67]We will count down the ball.
[495:16.17]I am going to get out of here.
[495:18.31]We will do the subs and bits and everything.
[495:20.01]There were ridiculous, insane money drops tonight.
[495:28.92]But also regular bit and subs as well I want to do too.
[495:36.94]Thanks for watching.
[495:38.80]Hopefully we see you tomorrow.
[495:41.10]If not, then hope you have a happy new year.
[495:43.81]Those of you that are not going to be around tomorrow for the festivities, I will see you again on Saturday.
[495:54.29]And I think we just confirmed that it was me and Joel are going to do Keep Talking and Nobody Explodes.
[495:59.25]I think that we just had that confirmed earlier in the afternoon.
[496:07.76]That was No More Heroes 1.
[496:08.54]It's a classic.
[496:09.22]It's great.
[496:09.84]If you can get your hands on it, go for it.
[496:12.44]We will be playing No More Heroes 2.
[496:15.50]We'll give a little No More Heroes cooldown.
[496:18.15]And maybe at some point next week, we'll go back to it.
[496:21.99]Do the second game.
[496:25.23]Maybe do something else.
[496:26.57]We'll see.
[496:32.47]The two worst streamers combined.
[496:36.91]Hey.
[496:38.13]What?
[496:39.33]The fuck?
[496:40.69]That's fucked up.
[496:45.60]Yeah, goodnight guys.
[496:46.20]We'll see you tomorrow.
[496:49.12]That will conclude No More Heroes 1.
[496:52.07]And let's teleport back to earlier this evening.
[497:05.97]Kind of a long one, I know.
[497:06.91]It's pretty late.
[497:07.73]I gotta get some food, too, soon here.
[497:14.46]Holy shit, these subs.
[497:16.34]These subs and pits.
[497:17.46]There's so many huge pit drops.
[497:21.06]Sergil Butt is the first one here for $2.50.
[497:22.58]Thank you, Sergil Butt.
[497:23.70]They say Happy New Year.
[497:24.52]Happy New Year to you as well.
[497:26.94]Thank you.
[497:29.64]Shazo IP dropped 20 community subs.
[497:32.04]Freddy Dredd had the more than $1,100 tonight, Freddy.
[497:37.76]Fucking ridiculous.
[497:38.81]Absolutely crazy.
[497:40.59]Crazy.
[497:42.73]I never expect anybody to do something like that.
[497:45.57]All I can say is thanks.
[497:50.12]Absolutely insane.
[497:52.56]Thank you.
[497:55.34]We also had 1,000 bits from Local Crafts.
[497:58.30]No message, just 1,000 bits.
[498:04.94]Thank you, Local Crafts.
[498:08.21]Also, CoreMonster, not to be overlooked here, with 75 community subs.
[498:17.13]75.
[498:18.77]FreddyDread, also on top of the bits, gave 50 community subs.
[498:27.09]a bunch of people in a row gave subs there I think we caught them all but and they were tier two yeah they were 50 tier two community subs bonkers it's bonker it is that's bonkers
[498:55.47]That's almost, I think, that's close to two grand.
[498:58.07]Three grand in one stream.
[499:01.37]Freddy Dredd.
[499:02.71]Holy shit, thank you.
[499:08.25]Also, AVEXE gave 1000 bits.
[499:11.46]Part of that insane train of money that pulled into the station here.
[499:16.96]Thank you, AV.
[499:21.98]Also, Lucas.
[499:23.04]Thank you, Lucas, for the 1000 bits.
[499:24.24]10 bucks as well.
[499:28.36]They just say, jermaHeart, thank you, Lucas.
[499:29.72]How are you going to spend your newfound earnings?
[499:34.58]On... I don't know.
[499:37.73]Stuff for the stream?
[499:41.89]I mean, the reason why I've been able to... In 2019, we'll go over it quick.
[499:46.85]I'm going to talk about this tomorrow, too.
[499:50.16]But... There were a lot of big... Streams in 2019.
[499:59.76]that required to hire people and resources and that shit is only possible because of the support that this channel gets.
[500:10.43]That doesn't happen without this ridiculous amount of money that some people give.
[500:19.83]The continued subscriptions that people have on this channel.
[500:22.19]I can't do those things without it.
[500:28.76]So, seriously, 2019 was crazy.
[500:37.58]We'll talk about it more tomorrow.
[500:42.16]But thank you, again.
[500:44.94]Superintendent Chalmers, thanks for the $2.50.
[500:47.79]Jerma Erectus, apparently, is an emote.
[500:50.13]It says there's an error.
[500:51.35]It wasn't found.
[500:54.09]I'm sorry, I can't see your emote.
[500:57.46]I don't see is it was did I get baited I might have gotten baited snoozing copter thanks to the 250 on top of your 5 000 bit drop here earlier they say oh yeah I also want to tell you about I want oh here's is this we're gonna get the God Hand uh this is God Hand
[501:22.32]God Hand has a weird, over-the-top humor similar to this.
[501:25.75]There are more than a hundred unique moves to unlock, with which you can customize your moveset.
[501:31.17]You can assign a move to each button, basically.
[501:33.99]If you want a dropkick on triangle, you can put it there.
[501:36.51]Or maybe on X, and put an uppercut on triangle, etc.
[501:40.55]There's a casino that actually functions, and the composer is the same one as the one from this game.
[501:47.47]Okay.
[502:21.14]It's not going to be the first stream of 2020.
[502:22.76]That stream, I believe, is going to be Joel and I playing Keep Talking, Nobody Explodes.
[502:28.24]Maybe it'll be the second stream of 2020.
[502:31.20]Third stream of 2020.
[502:31.82]It'll be early 2020.
[502:33.21]I'll do it again.
[502:42.73]You jumped into God Hand after trying to make the shitty Tony Hawk ride skateboard work for 10 minutes.
[502:48.63]It deserves a second chance.
[502:50.00]That's fair.
[502:53.92]Oh, didn't I try to break that over my... I remember trying to smash that over my knee and I couldn't break it.
[502:57.72]That's the only memory I have of that whole stream.
[503:09.57]Well, yeah.
[503:10.97]I will give it another try, I promise.
[503:16.91]I only want good streams in 2020, no bad ones.
[503:22.35]You gotta crack a few eggs to make an omelet.
[503:27.05]comedy tragedy hey gnarly thanks for the 250 hello it's a me Mario thank you so much for playing this Nintendo game on a legitimate Nintendo Wii system you should consider streaming more Nintendo games in the future especially certain RPG a game featuring me and my brother you are a super streamer wahoo
[503:56.60]Thank you, Mario.
[504:00.04]Nintendo is one of the consoles I have neglected over the years.
[504:02.80]There was that string of Wii and Wii U games, though.
[504:09.18]I did do that.
[504:09.90]I streamed Wii U for a week or two straight.
[504:14.09]Thanks, Mario.
[504:16.03]But I've not played any of the mainline popular AAA Nintendo games on this stream.
[504:22.55]I really haven't.
[504:28.84]But Mario Maker is more a compilation of memes than it is playing Breath of the Wild.
[504:43.47]Don't get me wrong, Mario Maker is fun.
[504:46.23]But that's not playing Mario Galaxy.
[504:49.43]That's playing a bunch of interesting compilations of people's levels.
[504:59.81]DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[505:01.17]Hi, Gap Gaming here.
[505:02.25]We are mildly concerned about you fucking someone on stream, but we'll let it slide since you did have all those Gap socks on.
[505:09.75]You did still have those Gap socks on.
[505:11.81]Anyway, have a Gap New Year.
[505:14.78]You're gonna get me fucking in trouble.
[505:22.46]RockWriting, thanks for the 300 bits.
[505:27.20]RockWriting.
[505:29.69]Jerma, I got your contact info from a friend of mine, Moira Chisholm.
[505:34.24]I think you did some good sleuthing work with her in Scotland not too long ago.
[505:38.60]For some background on yours truly, you could officially call me a locator of fine goods per se.
[505:43.12]Nice things get lost, nice things stay buried for a while.
[505:45.34]I find the nice things, I get a piece of the pie.
[505:47.83]In other words, I'm a treasure hunter.
[505:49.89]Currently, I'm in Iceland in a small town called Skiprot, when I... That's it.
[505:57.99]I kind of wish I knew what was going on there uh moira thank you rock writing for the 300 bits thank you 25 Dr. pepper for the 250. show us a picture of your family dude nice nice content monster right Monster Rancher rap fan thanks for the 400 bits I've changed my username and given you bits now please sing the Monster Rancher rap on stream

[506:31.95]What is the Monster Rancher rap?
[506:44.23]Monster Rancher introduction theme song.
[506:53.58]This is your username now.
[507:29.66]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[507:33.82]It's cool.
[508:05.30]well uh oops wait what just happened what the just happened oh there we go thank you Monster Rancher rap fan for the 400 bits

[508:33.25]I heard this is where the guy fucks on stream.
[508:48.14]You heard wrong.
[508:49.30]Thank you for the 500 bits.
[508:51.06]FutureGamer, thanks for 250.
[508:53.40]You hated God Hand because the Tony Hawk ride physical skateboard was not working.
[508:57.18]Hold on.
[508:58.60]I was looking for this earlier.
[509:13.65]Did I just lose?
[509:15.47]I actually think I just lost.
[509:17.39]I'm so frustrated by the fucking... I can't even have fun in a video game now.
[509:21.41]I want to mail that to Tony Hawk.
[509:24.67]I want to cover that in peanut butter and mail it to him.
[509:30.18]Then he'll think it's shit, but it's just peanut butter.
[509:32.32]It's not a big deal.
[509:37.18]It's a hard game.
[509:38.42]Oh, well.
[509:41.72]Holy shit, what the fuck am I talking about?
[509:44.58]Alright, so that's... Okay, I get it.
[509:49.99]I see what you mean.
[509:54.60]What a psycho.
[510:02.92]I gotta give it another chance.
[510:04.22]I'll give it another chance.
[510:05.12]I will.
[510:05.84]Thank you for the 250.
[510:07.12]Appreciate it.
[510:07.96]Thank you, Curve Bumble, for the five.
[510:11.08]I can't do damage to- No, I can't!
[510:13.70]What am I supposed to say to that?
[510:15.82]How am I supposed to counteract that one?
[510:19.10]I can't- What am I supposed to say to that?
[510:21.34]Well, what am I- Oh, well!
[510:34.10]Barry Backtracker can't back up anymore.
[510:36.84]His heels are at the edge of a cliff and he turns around and he's like, well, the thing is, what I meant by that is, oh dear, there's not much room back here.
[510:46.54]Hey, Curbumble, thanks for the 500 bits.
[510:55.81]Really cool to see you playing No More Heroes and considering a bunch of fun PS2 GameCube-era games.
[511:01.07]We'd love to see you start the new year off with that.
[511:03.63]PS, think you also... You like Robot Alchemic Drive.
[511:07.73]It's a weird giant robot sim by the EDF devs.
[511:11.03]Never heard of it.
[511:11.43]That's... EDF is a great game, though.
[511:15.11]Oh, write Chibi-Robo.
[511:16.13]Write that down.
[511:16.61]It's a cleaning game.
[511:17.55]I want in the recommended... The Discord cleaning games.
[511:20.35]Chibi-Robo.
[511:20.87]Put it in there.
[511:25.63]Thank you, Kerboble.
[511:26.39]Appreciate it.
[511:29.57]Hey Graham, thanks for the $2.50.
[511:30.53]Hey Jerma, just got back from work and picked up a stuffed crust pizza for the first time in years because of you.
[511:35.29]Speaking of, I work at a family video, a rental store, and we do have an adult section.
[511:40.63]It is disgusting.
[511:41.47]You weren't wrong yesterday.
[511:43.63]Also, when is the next Jerma Rumble?
[511:48.81]The best part is how you said, and it's disgusting.
[511:52.18]The Dremel Rumble is going to be soon, but not soon as in a week or two, as soon as in maybe a month or two.
[511:59.89]Yeah, I wanted to have it coincide with, if you don't know, the next Dremel Rumble is going to be a charity stream.
[512:10.07]It's going to be to help sponsor one of my good friend's runs in the Boston Marathon.
[512:14.77]And all the money during that stream that comes in is going to go towards sponsoring his run.
[512:20.50]And all that money goes to, I believe it's going to go to a pediatric cancer ward in Boston.
[512:28.04]Pediatric Cancer Center in Boston.
[512:31.36]From what I've been told so far.
[512:41.48]That's the plan.
[512:45.90]Sponsoring running a marathon.
[512:49.38]I think the way that the Boston Marathon works is you... I don't want to speak completely out of place here, but I'm fairly certain it's... You raise money for a charity...
[513:06.90]And then you run in the marathon for that charity, I guess.
[513:11.33]Something like that.
[513:13.49]I'm not sure if every single person that runs the marathon has to do that, but I know that's what people do.
[513:21.28]What am I gonna... Oh my god, it's in the chat.
[513:28.58]Holy shit, that's horrible.
[513:34.88]I look like I made it a raw chicken meat.
[513:36.70]This is disgusting.
[513:37.76]Why did that just get bigger?
[513:39.47]Anyways.
[513:58.24]Thank you, Graham, for the 250.
[514:00.22]Stuffed crust pizza.
[514:01.16]It's pretty good.
[514:01.98]It's pretty good.
[514:04.05]Just hope that your stomach doesn't turn into a knot after it.
[514:09.45]Thanks for the bits.
[514:10.31]I appreciate it.
[514:10.81]Thank you, BloodyPunker, for the 500 bits.
[514:13.81]Hey, Jerm, I've been dealing with a lot of insecurity and paranoia around dumb stuff like my voice.
[514:17.48]As you have a background in voice acting and bring life to countless funny characters with yours, I figured you'd be a good guy to ask about experiences with vocal insecurity.
[514:25.26]Tips about overcoming it.
[514:26.28]Thanks.
[514:32.68]pretty much that when you first start talking to people and you hear your I'm not sure if you're talking about referencing hearing your voice back but when anytime anybody listens to themselves back they all you always sound a little weird you sound that's me I don't like that
[514:51.54]Everybody has this weird... Sort of... Not that I doubt that they hate your voice or anything, but... Everybody seems to have that sort of... You squint your eyes when you hear yourself talking.
[515:05.15]But it just takes time.
[515:06.33]It just takes a while.
[515:07.13]I mean, at this point... You just kind of know the way you talk.
[515:13.37]And... After a while, after you hear yourself back enough times... And you just accept the fact that that's just the way you sound...
[515:24.36]you become okay with hearing it back.
[515:29.62]If you go back and watch my first maybe 10 to 20 YouTube videos, I was trying to sound better.
[515:40.34]I was trying to sound smarter and more intelligent and better and more articulated and
[515:50.21]After about 10 videos or 20 videos or so, it's just like, I kind of just know the way, I just talk like this.
[515:54.91]This is the way that I talk and that's it.
[515:56.21]This is just what you get.
[515:57.17]This is how I speak.
[516:03.16]But for dealing with actual insecurity on your voice, I wouldn't read too much into it, to be honest.
[516:13.95]We communicate this way.
[516:19.16]I can't think of the last time that I heard somebody talk to me.
[516:23.35]Or somebody was giving a presentation or doing vocal work.
[516:27.39]And I thought even for a second about, hey, that doesn't sound right.
[516:30.73]No, that's just you.
[516:31.43]That's your voice.
[516:32.74]That's you.
[516:35.26]And that's good.
[516:35.94]That's fine.
[516:36.34]Everyone has a different voice.
[516:44.70]Guy from the servers.
[516:57.24]Okay, server Jerma.
[517:01.08]But yeah, that's who you are.
[517:02.95]That's how you talk.
[517:03.87]That's the person that you are.
[517:06.23]You gotta own it.
[517:07.83]Own it.
[517:08.85]Whatever it is.
[517:10.61]You gotta own the fuck out of it.
[517:11.59]You have to own it.
[517:19.32]I know him from the servers, don't you?
[517:23.84]But I wish you luck.
[517:24.94]Bloody...
[517:29.22]Own it.
[517:30.54]Thanks for the $500.
[517:31.02]Own it.
[517:31.34]Thanks for the $500.
[517:32.66]I've seen the bowl cut.
[517:46.40]Yes, and I've also seen the Gandalf from a Gandalf face.
[517:51.90]I don't know why that just looks like Gandalf to me.
[517:53.77]I don't know why.
[517:54.73]It does.
[517:55.47]Take that image that you just linked, put the Gandalf hat on it, and add a beard.
[518:02.97]You'll know what I'm saying.
[518:10.02]Thank you, DarkSoul for the 250.
[518:10.86]The one with when my chin is down and I have the nose.
[518:16.62]Dark Soul Thanks for the $2.50.
[518:17.34]Let me tell you something crazy about Crazy Dough in South Boston.
[518:21.50]It's my favorite pizza and I live in New York.
[518:24.84]That doesn't surprise me.
[518:25.61]Boston has some of the best pizza on the planet.
[518:27.85]Yeah.
[518:28.29]Number 7 on Earth.
[518:32.37]Dark Soul again, thanks for $2.50.
[518:33.57]Okay, but Domino's Pan Pizza, Mizza, with garlic white sauce is amazing.
[518:38.90]Also, if you use the $5.99 coupon for a medium pan pizza, you can choose a specialty pie, customize it, and effectively just get five to seven toppings of your choice for $2 more.
[518:48.44]So $7.99, it's a fantastic deal.
[518:50.11]Papa John's can go... go... whatever.
[518:59.51]Domino's pan pizza and pizza with garlic white sauce.
[519:03.07]I might order that tomorrow.
[519:06.53]This is on you.
[519:08.15]Dark Soul, if I order that, this is on you.
[519:12.52]Mm-hmm.
[519:14.86]Are you doing a bounty?
[519:15.78]No, I don't even know how bounties work.
[519:21.30]As on bounties, you... You say I'm gonna do a bounty and then you watch a Home Depot ad and then give your thoughts on it?
[519:29.69]Isn't that how it works?
[519:31.45]We play a game for an hour and you say, hey, that was good fun.
[519:39.23]What do you guys think about that Home Depot commercial?
[519:42.26]Are you more inclined to shop at Home Depot after watching this ad with me?
[519:46.78]Together?
[519:54.61]Or did you all tab into a different screen and mute my stream?
[520:00.63]Maybe eight of you watched it, and zero of you are going to go there.
[520:14.48]For all I know, half of you might not even be old enough to hold a hammer.
[520:29.36]How old do you have to be to hold a hammer?
[520:32.44]How old?
[520:32.72]What would you say?
[520:35.42]What age would you say is, I am comfortable with this person using a hammer?
[520:46.85]I'm gonna say... I'm gonna say at least... at least 15 to 16.
[520:54.08]I would not be comfortable with some... with like a 12 or a 13 year old with a hammer and nails.
[521:01.06]I'm gonna say like 16.
[521:10.19]Dude, like 6.
[521:12.21]You wouldn't give a 6 year old a hammer?
[521:15.45]Are you... are you out of your mind?
[521:17.35]If they're being supervised well, 10.
[521:26.85]I would say at least like 13.
[521:30.03]People get their driving permits at 15.
[521:31.87]Yeah, so if you can drive a car, you should be able to use a hammer.
[521:39.50]Fuck.
[521:40.32]Yeah, I was way off.
[521:41.88]I think I'm just getting old.
[521:43.94]And 16 is like 7 to me now.
[521:47.10]You know what I mean?
[521:47.54]If you're like, oh, I'm 15.
[521:48.20]You're a fucking baby.
[521:49.66]I'm so old now.
[522:06.76]how old is the man talking 34 35 this year in 2020 but anyways you 16 year olds older than me what
[522:31.82]The point is, hammers are dangerous.
[522:34.42]And... Just be careful.
[522:37.36]Be at least 13 and have adult supervision.
[522:45.89]Streamer's lying about age to give impression that he can use a hammer.
[522:50.55]Dammit, I thought you were like 28.
[522:51.55]Eh, close enough.
[522:53.83]After 28, you're the same age.
[522:55.51]Like I told this... After 27 or 28, you're the same age until you turn 50.
[523:10.09]Why am I talking about this?
[523:12.45]Um, somebody brought up using... Should kids use hammers?
[523:15.47]And I was like, I don't know, let's talk about it.
[523:17.27]It was something like that.
[523:25.64]Hey, Heckmaster, thanks for the 500 bits.
[523:29.20]Appreciate it.
[523:32.18]No message, just 500 bits.
[523:33.36]Thank you, Dodongos, for the 300 bits.
[523:37.90]Thank you, Niberi, for the 250 bits.
[523:40.84]Jay Jerma, love your streams.
[523:41.90]You're the only streamer I've watched in the past seven months.
[523:44.46]Just want to say thanks for the entertainment.
[523:49.82]Thank you, uh, for the 250.
[523:50.88]Hope you stick around.
[523:54.70]Thanks for watching.
[523:56.97]DJ Gamer, thanks for the thousand bits, DJ.
[524:00.99]Love your streams.
[524:01.87]Please play Disco Elysium.
[524:05.73]I was going to.
[524:06.35]It wasn't planned.
[524:10.81]It was part of the plan.
[524:12.38]But then it got voted off the island.
[524:15.10]From the Drew crew.
[524:17.80]So.
[524:19.88]I don't know if we'll ever see it.
[524:24.03]Thanks for the thousand bits though.
[524:25.05]Thanks for ten bucks.
[524:25.67]Appreciate that.
[524:26.27]Thank you!
[524:29.32]Thank you, Zavye, for the 250.
[524:31.78]Happy birthday, Jerma.
[524:32.92]40 is the new 20.
[524:34.94]40 is just... 40 is the new 30, which is also the new 45.
[524:38.38]If you turn up 50, you're an old person.
[524:40.16]Done.
[524:42.26]CougarDuke, thanks for 300 bits.
[524:43.88]Wii Sports Resort, Stream, or Riot?
[524:50.03]Maybe eventually.
[524:52.54]That's fucking horrible.
[524:53.44]I'm alright though, I'm here.
[525:21.40]Second Birdhouse stream.
[525:22.44]That was just what happened to the Labo stream.
[525:26.48]Cyclops Parker, a few hours ago, gave seven community subs.
[525:33.23]Didn't catch it.
[525:33.95]It was an individual boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing, boing.
[525:38.89]Thank you, Cyclops.
[525:40.59]You still here?
[525:41.09]There you are.
[525:42.31]Appreciate that.
[525:49.44]We're getting to the end here.
[525:51.82]Why don't we throw the credits on?
[525:53.50]And we'll change... We'll change gears here.
[525:55.82]Gonna bump you.
[525:57.48]There's gonna be a lot of subs that fly by tonight because there was a shitload of community subs.
[526:06.38]So many subs.
[526:08.24]Thank you, guys.
[526:11.50]All of you.
[526:11.86]From the bottom of my soul.
[526:16.80]For real.
[526:18.66]USB Boingle.
[526:19.90]Yeah?
[526:26.49]Jerma, I'm gonna dream about... Well, Noodle, that's the thing.
[526:29.11]We've talked about it so much this stream.
[526:32.35]You're gonna have another dream.
[526:34.41]You're gonna have another Jerma TOS dream.
[526:37.69]And you can tell us all about it when it happens.
[526:44.39]Thank you, Somnus, for the 500 bits.
[526:50.41]Hey Jerm, I'm going to Nevada at the end of April.
[526:52.93]I've been on the East Coast my whole life, so this is the first time I'm going to the West.
[526:56.03]Very excited.
[526:57.21]P.S.
[526:57.99]This is for a furry convention.
[526:59.41]I hope to see you there.
[527:05.13]I've already brought this up, but if I went to a furry convention, you would never know.
[527:10.35]I could go in a full costume and never take off the helmet, and you would never know that I went there.
[527:17.15]There would be no proof.
[527:18.57]There'd be no way for you to tell.
[527:22.64]I wouldn't talk.
[527:25.10]I wouldn't say a word.
[527:26.38]And that helmet would never come off.
[527:29.03]It would not be removed until I was safe in my home.
[527:39.13]I could just go.
[527:39.75]I could go anywhere.
[527:40.91]I could put on a fake mustache and a hat.
[527:44.21]And put on sunglasses and go anywhere.
[527:47.26]And you would never know I went.
[527:58.91]Everybody would know it's you.
[527:59.89]How?
[528:01.59]If I'm in a full costume that you don't see my face, and I don't ever take it off, unless I'm in a place where I know there's no cameras or anybody, how would you know who that was?
[528:21.62]Just sort through the frog costumes.
[528:23.82]No, I wouldn't go in a frog costume.
[528:25.36]I would go...
[528:27.35]I would go in like the most default costume possible.
[528:30.67]I would try to blend in as best as I could.
[528:33.37]Your voice?
[528:33.93]I wouldn't talk.
[528:34.53]I would do the pantomime thing.
[528:37.27]The wave the hands.
[528:38.71]Hands up.
[528:41.24]You know, this shit.
[528:42.28]I'd do this.
[528:48.32]Well, this isn't wrong.
[528:49.00]But you know, I would walk around.
[528:52.26]And I would do this stuff.
[528:53.84]You know, I'd be like.
[529:00.13]Who the fuck would know it was me?
[529:04.63]You wouldn't be... Somebody would say, oh, I really like your costume.
[529:09.15]And I'd go... You just gave away your routine.
[529:25.22]I'll change it.
[529:27.91]It's a furry convention, not Disneyland.
[529:33.00]Yeah, right.
[529:35.26]People do that in those costumes.
[529:52.92]How do I know that?
[529:55.12]No, I just know.
[529:56.34]I might go.
[529:57.42]I might, you guys don't even know.
[530:01.18]You don't think that, if you're talking to the person, you don't think we'd dedicate some time to this and go to something like this and just fucking blend in and I'd never tell you about it?
[530:20.82]We'll see.
[530:22.88]But thank you, Psalm, for the 500 bits.
[530:25.22]You'd brag on stream.
[530:26.60]Yeah, after the fact.
[530:29.16]After the fact and a full week or two later.
[530:34.62]I would talk about my time at this furry convention.
[530:39.54]It was me.
[530:40.40]That was me.
[530:48.83]That's true.
[530:49.39]No, I didn't tell you that I was a furry.
[530:50.57]I told you that I was going to blend in with the furries at the furry convention.
[530:53.37]Maybe.
[530:53.51]When is it?
[530:53.85]What day?
[531:17.27]Hey, Pin, thanks for the 250.
[531:18.17]Hey, Jerma, I gotta get up for a flight in three hours.
[531:20.73]Could you keep it down?
[531:21.33]Alright, I'll keep it down.
[531:29.37]Thank you, Peaceful Haley, for the 250.
[531:30.39]How you doing, Jeremy?
[531:32.61]Hope all is well.
[531:33.51]I don't really have much to say.
[531:34.57]Went to Galaxy's Edge and built a lightsaber.
[531:36.84]It was awesome.
[531:37.60]Until I came back home and my lightsaber just didn't work.
[531:41.18]It just didn't fucking work.
[531:42.12]I'm one of the unlucky few who just got a bad saber.
[531:44.28]That's not good.
[531:47.54]Going back soon to get a new one.
[531:48.62]I expect Disney to pay me money after this.
[531:51.76]Anyway, good night, Turbo.
[531:54.34]Man, that's not cool.
[531:55.02]Aren't those things 300 bucks?
[531:59.33]They better work.
[532:05.53]Defective kyber crystal.
[532:12.13]Sorry to hear that, PeacefulAla.
[532:13.33]That's an expensive purchase, and hopefully you can get it figured out.
[532:17.34]Thanks for the 250.
[532:19.98]Hey, Pin, thanks again for the 250.
[532:21.30]Hey, Jerma in chat, I'm flying out of state for university in a few hours, and I'm scared.
[532:25.46]Do you have any advice for me?
[532:26.36]Thanks a lot.
[532:27.32]Also, go fuck yourself.
[532:28.56]Pogs in chat, jermaVenus, he read it.
[532:33.74]Uh, so for flying, what's some good ways for to fly?
[532:41.64]If you're scared of flying, the best thing for you to know
[532:47.70]And I'm going to spit out an incredibly inaccurate statement here.
[532:54.88]But I know that there's an accurate one somewhere.
[532:59.17]I'm going to paraphrase this accuracy.
[533:03.59]It's something like you are 500,000 times more likely to be injured in a car than ever in an airplane.
[533:15.88]Like, you're more likely to get bit by a great white shark than have anything happen or go wrong on an airplane.
[533:26.19]It's not that much, but the gist is true, right?
[533:28.31]That's... Somewhere in there.
[533:32.27]Paraphrased.
[533:37.83]Oh, they're not afraid of flying.
[533:41.57]I'm flying out of state for university and I'm scared.
[533:45.49]Oh, like flying... Okay.
[533:48.53]Different topic entirely.
[533:49.89]Alright, different topic entirely.
[533:51.63]So, you're flying out of state and... Don't be nervous.
[533:56.19]Be excited because that's a new experience.
[533:57.75]You're going to meet a bunch of new people, a bunch of new friends.
[534:00.21]It's a new chapter in your book.
[534:03.67]You should look forward to reading it.
[534:06.71]Also, you're 300,000 times more likely to be eaten by a great white shark than you are getting hurt on an airplane, just in case you're wondering.
[534:22.03]Unkind, thanks for the 500 bits.
[534:25.29]Yeah, thanks for stopping by.
[534:26.43]Hope you have a relaxing rest of your evening here.
[534:54.57]Wait, you guys are getting this for free?
[534:59.03]What?
[535:22.51]You are now cursed.
[535:23.65]Thanks.
[535:25.15]I'm not showing this one, because this one really is cursed.
[535:32.64]Thank you, Buttsquire, for the two... I'm not.
[535:34.56]That'll actually curse everybody here.
[535:35.74]I'm not doing that.
[535:37.99]You actually will have... You'll have, like, a... You'll... You don't... I don't want to curse you anymore.
[535:48.54]Hey, Godot, thanks for the 250 bits.
[535:50.09]Hey, Jeremiah, I might have a solution to your Ace Attorney flashing problem.
[535:54.85]Okay.
[535:55.33]If you pirate the Wii version of Ace Attorney, it was originally on the Wii Shop, you play without the flashing white screens.
[536:02.51]I even tested this and can confirm that at least the first case has no flashing.
[536:09.96]Hopefully this can give you a chance to play it even if it's not on stream.
[536:15.56]Really?
[536:23.81]No flashing, huh?
[536:26.69]Even if it's not on stream.
[536:33.13]Buy the Steam version.
[536:38.97]I think the Steam version still has flashing, though.
[536:41.11]But, I... Interesting thought.
[536:48.12]UnZeroic, thanks for the 300 bits.
[536:49.94]Hey Jerm, I have two questions for you.
[536:51.42]Two.
[536:52.08]First of all, what do you think is the best Looney Tunes character?
[536:56.09]Not to be confused with your favorite Looney Tunes character.
[536:59.05]That's not what I'm asking.
[537:02.23]What do you think is the best Looney Tunes character, but not your favorite Looney Tunes character?
[537:06.66]Uh... Probably not.
[537:14.94]Probably Yosemite Sam?
[537:18.85]Daffy?
[537:20.46]Daffy was great.
[537:27.94]The Roadrunner?
[537:28.52]Yeah.
[537:30.36]Daffy, Roadrunner, Yosemite Sam, in that order.
[537:32.51]Okay, what's the next question?
[537:40.85]My second question is, what your favorite Looney Tunes character is?
[537:51.06]They said the best, not top three.
[537:52.54]Daffy Duck.
[537:53.08]Daffy Duck for both answers.
[537:57.24]Freddie Dredd, thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[538:00.29]More money from Freddie.
[538:02.39]Let me sponsor the next carnival.
[538:04.85]In a way, you already are.
[538:05.85]You just don't know it.
[538:10.19]So, thank you.
[538:16.16]Let me sponsor the next carnival.
[538:18.48]Freddie Dredd.
[538:21.74]You already are.
[538:24.41]Daffy Duck is better than Bugs Bunny.
[538:28.03]Yeah, Bugs Bunny's classic, but Daffy Duck is irreplaceable, you know?
[538:38.25]He's grinning so hard right now.
[538:39.96]Yes, he is.
[538:42.46]Yes, he is.
[538:48.21]Ladies and gentlemen, that is going to conclude the stream tonight.
[538:57.03]We'll see you tomorrow.
[539:01.92]For the New Year's Eve stream.
[539:07.28]Let's move to the end.
[539:12.37]Thank you again to everybody.
[539:17.39]I really appreciate it.
[539:18.23]Let me see.
[539:26.21]Alright, ready?
[539:27.13]We're going to do something tonight.
[539:28.01]Those of you who remember the Jerma Slots game from CAD BTV.
[539:39.69]CAD is currently streaming right now.
[539:43.42]So...
[539:46.18]I think we should go... Let's go say hello.
[539:58.51]This is the JermaSlots guy.
[540:01.05]If you were curious.
[540:05.61]Go say what's up.
[540:07.63]Tell him Jerma985 sent you.
[540:10.78]He wasn't... Wait, hold on.
[540:11.78]He wasn't watching the stream today?
[540:17.05]Are you serious?
[540:17.86]Well, maybe we shouldn't raid him at all!
[540:28.14]Nah, let's go.
[540:29.82]What's he playing?
[540:32.08]Alright, cat, let's see.
[540:32.75]Let's see what you got.
[540:42.94]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[540:43.70]Happy New Year if I don't see you tomorrow.
[540:46.14]Take care.
[540:46.64]Have a great night.
[540:48.16]Goodbye.
