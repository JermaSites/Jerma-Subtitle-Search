[00:00.09]We're already in a game, I guess.
[00:03.05]Where are we?
[00:04.79]We're up that way.
[00:06.09]Ladies and gentlemen, welcome to the New Year's Eve countdown stream.
[00:33.68]I don't even know if anybody's here yet.
[00:36.96]Whoa, this is some lag.
[00:43.40]Just got thrown into this game.
[00:44.88]I don't even know what's happening.
[00:47.54]All I know is I just got tossed in here.
[00:49.56]I went to matchmaking and all of a sudden I'm in somebody's game.
[00:56.50]They're everywhere.
[01:06.13]Yeah, I would have done like a more proper intro, but... Just got sucked in here.
[01:11.11]Hi!
[01:11.95]Hi guys!
[01:12.79]Hello!
[01:13.17]Welcome to my New Year's Eve countdown stream.
[01:19.36]I wanted to do this so that it would be fun to like count down the New Year.
[01:22.00]At least East Coast.
[01:24.10]Gatling gunner!
[01:28.94]He's dead.
[01:32.20]This is Vermintide.
[01:34.22]Vermintide?
[01:36.71]If you've never played it before, it's kind of like Left 4 Dead.
[01:39.05]Holy shit.
[01:41.39]No!
[01:41.79]Alright, if you've ever played Left 4 Dead, it's Left 4 Dead with rats.
[01:49.45]That's pretty much all you need to know.
[01:57.60]Happy New Year to those of you that have had the New Year go by already.
[02:06.51]But us on the East Coast still have quite a little bit of ways, like an hour or so till we can count it down.
[02:22.36]This game has pleasantly surprised me though.
[02:25.82]I held off installing this game for like at least a month or two.
[02:40.11]All right, yeah, get the Star subsound out of your system.
[02:45.08]Yeah, we all heard it.
[02:46.56]It was really funny.
[02:48.52]Star makes the funniest jokes, right?
[02:52.36]And by funniest jokes, I mean he just, like, insults me, and that's it.
[02:56.29]Good joke.
[02:57.29]Good jokes, Star.
[02:59.53]Really good punchline.
[03:03.97]Okay.
[03:10.81]I'm okay on health.
[03:24.78]And nobody wants to mention the fact that he didn't stream for a month.
[03:33.11]No, no, it's all gonna be about how Jerma sucks, right?
[03:37.27]Bullshit.
[03:39.90]He's a fucking jokester.
[03:41.52]I'll tell you that.
[03:42.16]I don't even want to play this character.
[03:54.05]I want to play the dwarf guy.
[03:56.83]There's so many healing.
[03:59.19]I've never seen this many healing.
[04:00.05]This is not easy.
[04:00.73]I thought it was only normal or hard.
[04:06.65]I don't know if I'm going to stream Vermintide for a while.
[04:09.95]I think.
[04:12.51]Oh dear.
[04:29.18]Hey, what Left 4 Dead mod is this?
[04:31.76]Alright, get it out of your system.
[04:33.80]Go ahead, get it out of your system.
[04:35.40]Let's hear it.
[04:37.78]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[04:44.40]I was just freaking out right there.
[04:47.44]Oh, did you?
[04:49.40]Where the fuck did he come from?
[04:51.06]What the fuck?
[04:52.26]Oh, my God.
[04:55.92]I'm just stuck up here.
[04:56.62]I don't want to jump.
[04:57.12]I'll die.
[04:57.76]Bye-bye.
[04:59.16]Holy shit, I'm still alive.
[05:00.46]Jeez.
[05:20.51]Oh, what the fuck, an assassin rat?
[05:23.83]Nah, I don't wanna do that.
[05:32.01]We gotta get this big motherfucker out of here.
[05:34.09]I like this arrow because it bounces around everybody.
[05:49.13]And I hit him like right in his face.
[05:55.35]You know, I could address... I want to.
[06:02.26]I want to.
[06:02.66]I've been very silent about it.
[06:04.02]I've been very quiet about it.
[06:06.18]Because I have to be.
[06:08.98]Everybody wants to talk about Jerma wrestling.
[06:12.02]And God, guys, me too.
[06:14.74]I really do.
[06:16.64]But I can't.
[06:17.24]I just can't.
[06:21.96]Just, just be patient.
[06:23.40]That's all I can say is it's not gonna happen in 2015.
[06:28.17]You just gotta be patient.
[06:29.05]You gotta trust me on this one, okay?
[06:30.47]You gotta trust me.
[06:32.07]Be patient, and your patience will pay off.
[06:35.75]I hope.
[06:37.75]Maybe.
[06:38.11]Uh, do we have any, like, tubes or anything?
[06:45.79]This is called Vermintide, that is correct.
[06:47.31]I need to move my mic.
[06:49.25]Oh, somebody got a loot die.
[06:51.35]Sorry, this is going to make a little bit of noise.
[06:53.21]Hopefully it's not too loud when I move this around.
[06:54.93]I hope I don't get jumped on.
[06:57.07]I like this game a lot.
[06:59.81]This game sort of flew a little bit under the radar.
[07:15.09]It wasn't one of those games that a bunch of people were talking about.
[07:17.37]I think people were talking about it.
[07:20.63]But it's just fun to play.
[07:22.81]How did I not hit him?
[07:28.21]It's good just to walk around and slash a bunch of rats, you know?
[07:30.95]Alright, we gotta move.
[07:41.94]I would say, if you really want to know when Jerma Rumble 4 is coming out, the only thing I can tell you is probably Spring 2016.
[07:51.03]I don't know.
[07:55.87]Trust me when I say that.
[07:57.74]Hopefully, it's worth it.
[07:59.78]I hope it's fucking worth it.
[08:09.75]It is a Warhammer game.
[08:10.77]It is Warhammer End Times.
[08:17.38]I didn't know what level we are at right now.
[08:27.97]I've only not completed one.
[08:29.69]I didn't beat the last campaign yet.
[08:32.55]Oh shit, that's not good.
[08:40.79]Where are they coming from?
[08:44.91]Ooh, that was a double.
[08:45.99]I'm not very good with this character.
[08:56.27]Because it's... I'm not good at hitting headshots with the bow.
[09:01.23]It's very quick.
[09:03.57]But this is actually... Bounce around arrow, I really like.
[09:07.75]I'll show you guys my items when I get a second after this level.
[09:13.85]When I get a moment.
[09:15.09]Or two.
[09:26.24]What characters are there in this game?
[09:28.10]Oh, there's five classes.
[09:33.98]There are five ca- What the flying fuck?
[09:44.98]Jeez.
[09:46.16]Why was he shooting me?
[09:46.93]Get away.
[09:47.93]I am in deep shit.
[09:51.37]I gotta stay back.
[10:04.08]I've got to stay way back.
[10:09.66]Another gatling gunner rat?
[10:10.76]Are you serious?
[10:20.84]He's still alive?
[10:23.95]Oh my god.
[10:25.15]Oh god, this is not good.
[10:26.71]This is not good.
[10:27.59]The gas rat is just fucking this all up.
[10:32.18]No, why is it... Stop going that way.
[10:34.28]Go that way.
[10:34.82]Thank God.
[10:36.98]If I get touched for even a second, I'm dead.
[10:39.99]Oh, boy.
[10:40.45]I can't... Oh, God.
[10:42.99]I think this might be a done deal.
[10:46.73]Maybe not.
[10:51.13]Oh, I'm alive.
[10:53.83]I actually have been playing TF2.
[10:55.50]I've been playing the tough break campaign stuff.
[10:58.70]It's been fun.
[11:01.57]I don't know if I'll stream that tonight, but... In all seriousness, is this game supposed to be this similar to Left 4 Dead?
[11:09.22]Ah, yes.
[11:12.20]I would say that this is as close to Left 4 Dead 3 as you could possibly get without it being Left 4 Dead 3.
[11:22.24]Like, take Left 4 Dead and rewind it into medieval times with some magic shit.
[11:27.51]It is Left 4 Dead.
[11:30.29]But it has an item system, which you, like, kind of craft items.
[11:33.09]You roll for items.
[11:36.33]We'll see.
[11:39.70]I really could use that.
[11:41.26]And so could you.
[11:41.94]But I grabbed it first, so I'm drinking it.
[11:43.86]Ugh.
[11:45.20]Ugh.
[11:58.10]Uh-oh.
[11:59.18]He's getting grabbed by a stick rat.
[12:02.56]Oh, don't close me out of here.
[12:03.54]I want to help.
[12:08.43]How much does it cost?
[12:09.29]I think it is currently on sale for 15% off.
[12:13.79]I think it's $25 or whatever your... I don't know, whatever $25 American dollars is for you or whatever it is.
[12:27.87]I wish I was the voice for the rats in this game.
[12:29.63]That would be awesome.
[12:32.15]I would love to be the rats.
[12:38.84]Give that to the caster.
[12:40.20]You drink that.
[12:44.74]What time is it?
[12:45.34]It is like 1130?
[12:45.88]1140?
[12:45.96]We're counting down the new year, guys.
[12:50.58]We are counting down the new year.
[12:53.32]We're going to do a big countdown.
[12:54.32]I'm going to put a big countdown on screen and shit.
[12:56.18]It's going to be awesome.
[12:58.38]I got a party hat specifically to do it.
[13:00.18]I got one of those like... Those things you blow into.
[13:07.13]A whistle, a horn.
[13:08.25]Oh, a horn whistle.
[13:15.17]It's safe to say this game is fun.
[13:16.27]Yes.
[13:16.55]If you like the Left 4 Dead formula, there is no reason why you would not like this game.
[13:23.91]If you get a couple of your buddies, and you jump in and you play, and you guys all enjoy the Left 4 Dead formula, there's almost no differences, besides the fact that it is melee.
[13:34.92]Predominantly a melee-only game, with sidearms and bows.
[13:45.37]Close this fucking door.
[13:46.29]What, are you living in a barn?
[13:52.55]I think we might defend this room for a minute.
[13:55.56]Are we just going to defend this area?
[13:59.90]Jeremiah, I bought you a glue man shirt.
[14:01.14]Do you love me yet?
[14:01.92]Of course I do.
[14:04.49]Come on, do you even have to ask that question?
[14:06.05]This is very tense music for nothing really happening.
[14:15.06]Watch out, watch out for the one rat.
[14:20.31]Where the hell are they?
[14:26.39]What is going on here?
[14:27.49]Are they all coming in this door?
[14:30.35]Oh, I guess so.
[14:31.10]I guess they're coming in the front door.
[14:33.44]What a bunch of idiots.
[14:35.48]You could have flanked us.
[14:43.30]Oh, auto-update.
[14:44.18]I have an auto-update.
[14:45.46]For those of you that have been following my Twitter these last week or two.
[14:50.54]I kind of ran into a little bit of a nightmare situation with my dog, for those of you that don't know.
[14:56.84]Hold on, I've got to get her some wet.
[15:02.77]He has Addison's disease.
[15:04.93]Just got diagnosed this past week.
[15:08.55]I was in the vet for pretty much every single day straight last week.
[15:13.90]He was getting blood work done, he was getting tests done, and all kinds of awful shit.
[15:19.22]And it turns out he needs to go on prednisone, steroids, for the rest of his life.
[15:25.41]And I have to give him a little squeeze out of this little syringe thing into his mouth every day.
[15:33.56]And I have to do that for the rest of his whole life.
[15:36.99]But, but the upside is he is perfectly fine.
[15:41.47]He has done a complete 180 from being all sorts of fucked up to being like the dog I, I, I, a normal dog.
[15:50.33]Like he is just auto.
[15:51.63]He's back to normal.
[15:52.41]Completely like almost 100% back to normal after doing the treatment.
[15:56.66]So that's that.
[15:57.44]That's a thing.
[15:58.74]He's okay.
[16:00.94]I can show him on camera here in a minute if I really want to.
[16:05.17]Yeah, when we do the big countdown, I'll show Otto on screen.
[16:12.93]Oh dear, that's the big gunner guy.
[16:23.04]I like and don't like this character.
[16:28.41]Oh, shit.
[16:29.19]Don't get split up.
[16:34.03]Yeah, the doctor actually told me that with Addison's disease for dogs, if you have a dog that is in a very high-stress environment, he can get all messed up.
[16:45.72]Like, if he had thunderstorms, dogs that run under the bed during a thunderstorm.
[16:50.74]If he's that type of dog, apparently he can have all kinds of problems because he can't produce cortisol.
[16:57.05]So the doctor's like, make sure you don't put him in any stressful situations.
[17:00.73]It could fucking kill him.
[17:03.27]Well, he didn't say that, but that's what I took from it.
[17:05.47]And there's a tank following us.
[17:07.18]This is not a good opportunity to get a tank to follow us.
[17:14.18]Where is he?
[17:15.32]He appeared in my face last time.
[17:16.78]I hope he does not do it again.
[17:21.52]Where is he?
[17:24.38]I don't know.
[17:24.84]I'm just going to pick up this egg sack.
[17:28.94]Protect me.
[17:31.78]Come on.
[17:32.20]I need some protection here.
[17:33.30]I'm picking up the fucking egg sacks.
[17:40.03]Here we go.
[17:40.95]Keep going.
[17:41.51]Keep going.
[17:43.39]Let them just deal with the tank.
[17:45.75]I got to protect you.
[17:47.05]How about this?
[17:48.13]I'm going to drop one and you drop one.
[17:56.62]Oh, boy.
[17:57.96]Don't look back.
[17:59.86]He's not behind us, I promise.
[18:01.20]That guy's doing a hell of a job.
[18:07.26]He's still alive.
[18:09.54]I'm gonna heal this guy, too.
[18:11.14]Once we get done with this other one.
[18:14.20]Alright.
[18:17.63]Come over here.
[18:18.79]Hey, right in... Come here, come here, come here.
[18:20.89]Did I get it?
[18:24.99]Oh, that was... I guess that was not the guy I wanted to be.
[18:28.37]I thought that was the witch... No, it wasn't the witch hunter.
[18:30.45]Shit!
[18:31.21]That's right, look at me.
[18:41.73]No!
[18:44.51]Where's the pack rat?
[18:46.33]I got you.
[18:49.17]Oh, you were in such a bad spot, dude.
[18:50.66]We're gonna have to get you later.
[18:56.08]Can I get him?
[18:57.92]Wait, what?
[18:58.52]Oh, God.
[19:00.11]This is bad news.
[19:06.51]This is really bad news.
[19:09.27]Yeah, just you bring him back to life.
[19:11.54]I'm just gonna... Holy shit, that guy caught me out of midair.
[19:13.88]He got me in mid-fucking-air.
[19:22.54]Have I had any Dr. Oakers lately?
[19:23.88]I have it all the time.
[19:28.16]That rat is freaking out in that wall.
[19:34.98]At least we killed the tank, right?
[19:36.18]Did we kill the tank?
[19:37.41]I think.
[19:38.97]There's still an assassin rat.
[19:40.09]There he is.
[19:40.47]Shit.
[19:42.79]Don't let him wrap around us.
[19:44.13]Stay together.
[19:44.73]Stay together.
[19:45.15]Stay together.
[19:45.53]Stay together.
[19:47.41]That guy's got a healing drought.
[19:50.62]He should just drink it.
[19:52.20]Just drink that shit, dude.
[19:57.90]Drink that shit.
[20:04.76]There's only two more sacks.
[20:06.02]We gotta go two by two.
[20:06.96]Oh, you know what?
[20:07.36]We should just do four by four, then.
[20:09.53]I'm not going over there by myself.
[20:10.63]That's a fucking terrible idea.
[20:19.03]Don't go over there by yourself.
[20:19.89]Don't go by yourself!
[20:22.01]Oh, boy.
[20:23.45]Well, I have to come with you now.
[20:30.00]Oh god.
[20:32.60]Dude, I'm just distracting these dudes.
[20:34.48]Hopefully you pick up that cereal bag and get it in here.
[20:39.00]We're just kind of getting thrown into this game.
[20:45.95]Like halfway through it.
[20:46.77]Oh, never mind.
[20:48.89]I spoke too soon.
[20:50.83]There is no friendly fire.
[20:52.33]Friendly fire does not exist in this game.
[20:55.51]Which is good because that would kind of be outrageous.
[21:00.21]It'd be hard to... Because everyone's throwing their hands around spamming.
[21:04.87]Let's get out of here.
[21:06.01]I'm running out of nicknames for Pokemon.
[21:16.41]Any ideas?
[21:16.75]Ultradon.
[21:25.37]That's a pretty good name.
[21:25.95]Either I'm thinking Ultradon or... Dred... Dread... Jim...
[21:36.00]Jim Varney... Earnest.
[21:43.00]Oh we got a couple of bonus dye, oh yeah.
[21:54.95]Alright, so to explain this in as tiny of a way as I possibly can.
[22:01.17]You get dice.
[22:02.57]All you have to do is you have to roll one face.
[22:05.09]Like, for instance, none of the symbols matter.
[22:07.57]You just have to roll a face up.
[22:10.17]So, the amount of face ups I roll, I get either a common or an uncommon.
[22:14.29]It did it for me, but okay, here we go.
[22:16.42]So that's one, two, three, four.
[22:17.58]So that's one, two, three, four.
[22:19.10]I got a green bow.
[22:20.00]And...
[22:24.18]I actually am kind of curious what this is.
[22:28.42]Black Meadow Bow Longbow.
[22:31.38]And the upgrade is increased zoom distance.
[22:40.79]Give me a second.
[22:41.57]I need to see... Guys, we are just about 20 minutes away from New Year's Day.
[22:50.69]The big New Year 2016.
[22:51.63]I'm going to count it down.
[22:55.42]just about 20 minutes away for the big countdown.
[23:08.01]All right, let's see.
[23:13.96]So there are exactly the same.
[23:16.88]The only, I think this bow does not have the homing trail.
[23:23.81]So the only difference is this is just a longbow.
[23:28.41]They are identical in stats.
[23:31.07]This one has homing.
[23:33.33]This one does not, but it has higher... I can like see a zoom distance.
[23:39.00]Let's just look at it.
[23:41.26]Yeah, there we go.
[23:41.84]So it just zooms in farther.
[23:43.54]And that's not even upgraded.
[23:44.46]I can upgrade it and get even further.
[23:49.72]You kind of can get screwed sometimes.
[23:52.32]When the homing arrow wants to just go wherever it wants.
[23:59.58]It's still fun to... I don't know.
[24:00.42]How many bullets?
[24:01.20]Oh, arrows.
[24:02.06]This has more arrows too.
[24:04.43]This has 40 plus arrows.
[24:05.63]That other one has 29 I think, right?
[24:07.31]Let's see.
[24:09.95]I think so, right?
[24:10.91]Yeah, let's see.
[24:12.59]29.
[24:12.61]So yeah, I lose like 20.
[24:14.07]Just about like 15 arrows or 18 arrows or something.
[24:16.30]But I don't know.
[24:17.30]Something about the homing is cool.
[24:22.31]I could salvage some shit.
[24:27.43]I don't like this.
[24:28.05]We're going to get rid of it.
[24:30.75]We're going to get rid of this.
[24:38.39]28.
[24:38.74]I can make another common, but I don't think I want to.
[24:43.84]Have I decided on my game of the year 2015?
[24:45.28]Of course I have.
[24:46.50]Bloodborne.
[24:48.88]Of course I have.
[24:49.82]Bloodborne for sure.
[24:52.36]Although, I don't know.
[24:53.34]It's a toss-up.
[24:54.74]I might need to, like, hold my own award ceremony to figure that out.
[24:59.94]We'll see.
[25:00.20]We'll see what the Academy thinks.
[25:12.98]Maybe I should just craft something.
[25:15.02]I don't want this.
[25:15.50]I'm going to craft... Fucking craft it.
[25:17.08]Now I'm going to use the gems to make...
[25:23.15]What do I want to make?
[25:24.51]What character do I want to make something for?
[25:26.67]Let's go with... I like the dwarf.
[25:37.01]I'm just going to have to go with whatever.
[25:40.74]Let's see.
[25:41.26]Alright, what am I going to get?
[25:45.16]Sword and a shield?
[25:46.26]Or axe and shield?
[25:47.02]I'll play the dwarf.
[25:49.98]Let's play the dwarf.
[25:56.70]So I currently have a blue, which is this, which is pretty good.
[26:01.88]This is what I just got.
[26:11.11]Sometimes it's fun to be shield guy.
[26:16.57]What's the upgrade on it?
[26:18.50]When hitting a man-sized enemy with a normal attack, there is a 5-15% chance to instantly kill it.
[26:25.42]What does that mean?
[26:28.69]Oh, thanks to all the subscribers, by the way.
[26:30.31]All the old and new ones.
[26:31.95]I haven't streamed in a while, so... Thanks.
[26:37.42]So, a normal man-sized enemy?
[26:39.70]Is everybody a man-sized enemy compared to me?
[26:58.61]I kind of like it.
[27:00.53]I'll just... I'll try it.
[27:02.01]I'm going to upgrade it.
[27:09.51]I got the absolute worst I could.
[27:10.83]I got the absolute bottom.
[27:15.99]That could have been 5 to 15.
[27:18.59]And I got 5.
[27:20.63]By the way, if you're wondering what that noise in the background is, that's my heater.
[27:24.80]In this room.
[27:30.51]Oh, it's talking about the special rats, like the bigger ones.
[27:32.83]Oh, that's kind of cool.
[27:34.13]I just wish it wasn't 5%.
[27:35.27]Because that 5% kind of sucks.
[27:38.78]Are we doing another mission with these same dudes?
[27:40.48]What's going on?
[27:40.98]Let's do it.
[27:45.90]Oh, waiting on his buddy.
[27:46.70]That's fine.
[27:48.34]That's my trusty shotgun.
[27:53.78]Even though it just sucks, it's a regular shitty shotgun.
[28:02.22]I want to get a legendary orange item in the game.
[28:04.78]For those of you guys that played this game, does anybody have...
[28:32.52]a orange item and if you do is there any real big difference between the uh the orange and non-orange I like having the shield though you you feel more involved when you're using a shield like this
[29:22.95]So here's my axe.
[29:24.49]This is the blue axe I have.
[29:25.89]It's a two-hander and it's big and it's a big swing.
[29:37.32]Giant rats.
[29:39.32]The orange items are a lot better.
[29:41.06]I just... I want to see one.
[29:42.88]I want to hold one.
[29:43.52]I just want to hold it.
[29:44.82]I just want to hold the damn thing.
[29:54.21]Here we go.
[29:55.59]I am... Am I ready?
[29:56.85]Alright, what do you guys think?
[29:59.09]Big blue two-hander.
[30:01.92]Or... Sword and shield protect teammates guy.
[30:09.22]I don't like this.
[30:11.34]This is how many people you can hit with a swing?
[30:14.08]That needs to be... That's so much bigger.
[30:18.06]Is this a one-hander?
[30:19.30]One-hander?
[30:24.65]I don't know.
[30:25.65]I guess I'll use the shield.
[30:36.84]Five, four, three, two, one.
[30:39.06]Zero.
[30:43.71]Prepare yourselves.
[30:54.86]You cannot change your weapon mid-mission, no.
[30:57.44]You cannot change your class or your weapon.
[31:00.84]The only time you can change is right at the very beginning.
[31:03.46]There is an inventory.
[31:05.10]Legitimately right when we start the game, right here.
[31:08.89]But other than that, nope.
[31:26.35]See you right here.
[31:27.69]Hmm, I can change my stuff.
[31:30.37]But I'll stay with this.
[31:35.44]These will do our humors good.
[31:37.88]I shouldn't have picked the shotgun.
[31:41.40]It's too close quarters.
[32:00.90]Kind of just have to get in everybody's way with this character.
[32:03.76]Get the shield on.
[32:12.31]That one felt good.
[32:13.79]That had a lot of weight behind it.
[32:17.69]Oh, that's an assassin rat.
[32:21.75]He's still coming in.
[32:22.65]Kill him.
[32:24.47]You gotta time these stuns.
[32:25.78]Is he dead?
[32:26.16]He's not dead.
[32:38.49]I hear him.
[32:40.25]There he is.
[32:43.65]Damn it.
[32:44.01]He's still alive.
[32:45.86]And now we're getting a horde.
[32:55.24]Bumps.
[32:55.52]They need more than one.
[32:57.96]Don't split up.
[32:58.44]Don't get caught up in this maze of a sewer we have here.
[33:01.42]Oh, that's a patrol of armored enemies.
[33:03.77]I don't want to see that at all.
[33:04.87]There's a lot of healing in here.
[33:18.56]You motherfuckers.
[33:20.48]So much blood on my screen, I can't see it.
[33:32.58]Not blood, it's like water.
[33:47.40]Let's move.
[33:48.60]Oh, fuck.
[33:49.20]There's every armor.
[33:50.06]Did we actually aggro them?
[33:51.86]Oh, god.
[33:53.58]What a perfectly timed bomb that was.
[33:56.46]Good work, dude.
[33:57.95]I just saved my ass.
[33:59.09]Yeah, they can break through my shield.
[34:04.93]Let's go.
[34:23.55]The Vermintide.
[34:26.47]Oh, fuck.
[34:26.99]Am I too little to jump this?
[34:30.56]My little body can't jump over that?
[34:32.30]Here comes another horde.
[34:37.54]Damn it!
[34:43.24]I wish I also had some cool emotes to show off, too.
[35:01.47]I hit him right in the neck.
[35:07.33]Assassin!
[35:08.27]Stay together!
[35:09.05]I gotta turn off those tutorial emotes things on the left.
[35:19.00]I already know what everything is if I just have the tooltip still turned on.
[35:23.46]Alright, so far so good.
[35:35.91]There's the thing to spin the thing to spin the thing Open the floodgates Hey, he said it he said it you hear him he just said it he said vermintide
[36:05.03]Here comes the race.
[36:19.98]Oh, I just love this game.
[36:21.26]I love how it feels.
[36:22.02]I love how it plays.
[36:24.08]It hit me in the back.
[36:28.32]I need to reload this gun.
[36:42.57]Fucking destroyed.
[36:51.61]Just a pile of rats.
[36:56.96]I didn't get the shield up?
[36:57.88]You kidding me?
[37:07.25]See you later.
[37:18.86]The FOV is a little strange in this game.
[37:20.92]At 90, it feels kind of odd.
[37:24.28]I have it set to 85 right now just because I get sort of tunnel vision-y when it's at 90 in this game for some reason.
[37:36.05]All right, somebody kill him.
[37:38.21]Somebody kill him.
[37:39.41]Somebody kill him.
[37:40.95]Somebody kill him.
[37:41.57]I think he's still alive.
[37:46.27]I don't know.
[37:47.27]Yeah, he's dead.
[37:52.68]Like, yeah, I'll put it up.
[37:54.06]You'll see.
[37:55.14]So right now it's at 85.
[37:56.04]So if I put it at 90, right?
[37:57.34]I don't know.
[38:00.68]It just kind of feels... Especially when you're turning corners.
[38:05.49]I mean, I'll keep it at 90.
[38:08.61]For some reason, I don't know what it is about this game's 90 FOV for me.
[38:12.03]It just feels odd.
[38:16.75]Alright, get him.
[38:22.18]I'm inhaling all the shots!
[38:24.36]Kill him!
[38:25.60]Oh my god, kill the fucking rat!
[38:28.86]Alright, now I have to heal.
[38:33.02]I'm sitting there taking so many hits.
[38:47.06]You're just weird.
[38:47.90]Well, I already know that.
[38:54.48]But see, like, okay, look when I turn the camera around.
[38:58.83]For some reason, hold on, I gotta deal with this.
[39:00.47]I gotta deal with something real quick.
[39:03.63]Hold on a second, I gotta deal with something real quick.
[39:11.10]One second, guys.
[39:12.00]I just gotta let somebody else deal with something that I was supposed to deal with real quick.
[39:19.02]Here's what I was talking about.
[39:21.76]So do you see like to the right how it's kind of almost like moving like a fisheye lens a little bit?
[39:30.96]Something about it just seems off.
[39:38.19]Give me that, it's mine.
[39:38.71]Guys, we are less than 10 minutes away.
[39:49.11]We're less than 10 minutes away from the New Year countdown.
[39:52.69]Where is he?
[40:10.82]He ran that way down the hall.
[40:19.63]Dammit.
[40:20.35]Oh shit.
[40:20.87]Turn around, turn around, turn around, turn around!
[40:50.18]He's already killed this guy.
[40:58.77]Thank you.
[41:02.09]That assassin was still alive, wasn't he?
[41:08.92]He still is alive.
[41:09.90]No, he's dead.
[41:20.19]I already have a potion.
[41:21.03]I need to start using them more often, I just don't.
[41:23.57]Ooh, free stuff!
[41:35.80]Anything else?
[41:37.74]Lots of stuff.
[41:52.24]Get out of here.
[41:57.48]Get out of here.
[41:59.54]Are we dropping down, or what are we doing here?
[42:03.81]Let's do it.
[42:07.55]Open the second floodgate.
[42:21.70]Get off me.
[42:25.22]What's going on?
[42:30.56]Where's the team?
[42:31.44]We've got to open up the gate, man.
[42:34.58]We've got a gate to open.
[42:43.21]Oh, there we go.
[42:43.73]There's teammate number one.
[42:46.65]Let's open it.
[42:55.95]Pull it.
[42:58.77]Get it open.
[42:59.57]There we are.
[43:07.40]They kind of do that in this game.
[43:08.78]It's like that music starts to play, they go... Then they start landing.
[43:25.45]Ooh, you guys.
[43:27.27]You guys are a... Eat shit!
[43:38.72]Not that much further.
[43:40.06]Door's open!
[43:47.45]Time to leave!
[43:54.85]Dropping grenades everywhere, huh?
[44:01.16]Let's get the hell out of here.
[44:03.84]Let's get the hell out of here.
[44:05.28]I need to escape the shield.
[44:09.92]I want to go by myself.
[44:22.63]Yeah, don't get jumped on.
[44:25.57]What the fuck?
[44:26.37]I was just blind.
[44:50.66]Outta the way.
[44:53.98]I'm in no mood for this shit.
[45:03.53]Loot die.
[45:04.13]That means we get to roll another die.
[45:11.17]No, one person, you can only have one last purr game.
[45:15.13]So they cannot be two dwarves, they cannot be two witch hunters.
[45:19.94]I'd like to keep, let's go, let's get out of here.
[45:22.04]Let's escape.
[45:24.46]We have to reach the coach, let's go.
[45:29.38]Live together, die alone.
[45:31.92]Live together, die alone, guys.
[45:44.67]Come on, come on, come on, come on, we gotta go!
[45:47.93]Get on the bus!
[45:51.52]Come on, fellas, get on the bus!
[45:58.58]Alright, let's move, that was a good run, that was a good run.
[46:03.63]And we are victorious.
[46:07.39]Ladies and gentlemen, we are like three minutes away.
[46:13.53]Three minutes away from the countdown.
[46:17.53]In just three short minutes, we are counting down the new year.
[46:22.47]Ooh, I like that.
[46:25.92]I want to get that.
[46:26.82]Roll.
[46:27.08]Come on.
[46:28.18]Give me like six.
[46:29.86]I just got so fucking destroyed right here.
[46:32.98]One.
[46:35.14]One die had a face.
[46:37.00]Cool.
[46:38.58]That's wonderful.
[46:41.06]I can't wait to just throw this in the trash.
[46:42.62]Oh, that's great.
[46:43.04]It would have been great to have that as a not of common.
[46:53.71]Yeah, the one thing I don't like about playing a shield character is you don't do a whole lot of damage.
[46:58.81]So you don't really get on the list anywhere.
[47:03.93]Alright, I'm gonna leave this game.
[47:05.74]Because we got a countdown to do.
[47:09.21]Ladies and gentlemen, hold on just a second.
[47:13.79]I'm putting up the countdown.
[47:21.04]Get me back to the inn.
[47:24.20]We're going to be watching that clock like a hawk.
[47:31.44]We're down to the last two minutes.
[47:36.38]Alright, let me go, let me go get my stuff.
[47:38.77]I gotta go get my, I gotta get over, hold on a second.
[47:40.31]I gotta get the camera on.
[47:43.90]I gotta get the camera on.
[47:45.18]Make sure we gotta get ready.
[47:46.98]I gotta go get my stuff.
[47:49.25]Countdown's in one minute!
[51:58.71]Nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two.
[52:05.58]How are you?
[52:07.26]Oh, goodbye.
[52:42.69]I got my fucking New Year robe for nothing.
[52:51.95]Bought this fucking bathrobe.
[52:53.52]It's a special New Year bathrobe.
[53:10.86]Happy New Year, everybody.
[53:12.80]Happy New Year.
[53:15.18]Hope 2016 is a good one.
[53:21.95]Let's play more Vermintide.
[53:24.83]Have I just been at this loading screen the entire time?
[53:35.68]Why have I not loaded into the inn?
[53:37.94]What is going on here?
[53:50.51]What time is it?
[53:53.01]Come on.
[53:59.55]Blood Baron, thanks for stopping.
[54:04.63]Hey, to 2016.
[54:05.41]Let's hope it's a good one.
[54:06.41]Right, everybody?
[54:07.39]Cheers.
[54:10.21]Let me turn off this heater.
[54:11.43]It's starting to, like, swelter in here.
[54:12.77]Alright, let me figure out...
[54:21.47]This fucking thing, shut up.
[54:26.05]It's like a fucking baby toy.
[54:27.87]Shut up.
[54:34.73]Shut up, you fucking baby cell phone.
[54:43.21]Okay, what's going on with it?
[54:44.05]I'm going to have to like end this process or something.
[54:47.31]Something weird is going on.
[54:51.99]Dude, my whole game has crashed.
[54:54.61]Holy crap.
[54:59.14]Okay.
[55:02.26]Well.
[55:02.54]Give me just a second here.
[55:09.21]Can I just reload the game?
[55:12.07]Whatever.
[55:14.43]I can reload it.
[55:15.17]It's fine.
[55:33.36]Why do you have batteries in a baby toy?
[55:36.66]Because I have nieces and nephews that come over here.
[55:40.80]And they need something to play with.
[55:55.59]Happy New Year.
[55:57.93]Much love.
[56:01.74]Oh, we forgot.
[56:02.55]We forgot about the very important dog cam.
[56:08.27]I'll show you guys Otto.
[56:11.19]He's over here being a freak show.
[56:15.50]Hold on.
[56:21.84]And... Hey!
[56:24.70]There's a dog!
[56:29.47]See, he's doing just fine.
[56:31.84]Hi, Otto.
[56:34.40]Otto.
[56:36.12]He's kind of sleeping over there.
[56:37.98]He kind of freaked out when I, uh... When I, like, jumped up there.
[56:43.52]He's lying on his little bed.
[56:45.99]On his New Year bed.
[56:54.75]M&M's Beach Party or Riot?
[56:58.07]What the fuck are you talking about?
[57:04.40]I don't want to play as... I can still play Dwarf, but I think I want to be Dwarf Big Axeman.
[57:15.42]Lock that up.
[57:25.39]I don't have enough to do that.
[57:28.59]Well, shit.
[57:30.85]I'm going to be...
[57:34.84]It could be this guy.
[57:35.52]I like this guy.
[57:37.84]He's fun.
[57:38.26]He's a big two-hander, man.
[57:42.12]The gun I have for him is a very powerful single-shot rifle.
[57:45.76]It takes a while to reload.
[57:46.62]This is what I'm using.
[57:56.04]Very strong pushes.
[57:57.90]Armor pen.
[57:58.64]And it's very, very strong.
[58:00.16]The normal attacks do a lot of damage.
[58:03.17]And it hits a shitload of people when you charge it up.
[58:06.90]So let's play, right?
[58:08.82]Let's play too.
[58:09.68]I gotta change my stream title.
[58:11.68]It's gotta say 2016.
[58:12.26]Gonna be a good one.
[58:12.92]2016.
[58:12.98]Can't wait.
[58:13.40]It's gonna be such a good one.
[58:14.34]New Year's resolution.
[58:16.59]There we go.
[58:17.09]2016.
[58:17.11]Gonna be a good one.
[58:17.91]There we are.
[58:35.52]What mission do I want to do?
[58:37.12]I don't know.
[58:43.06]How about... I'll try one on hard.
[58:52.15]Actually, I haven't even beaten it.
[58:54.65]I only have one mission I haven't done.
[58:55.91]But I don't know if I want to do that right now.
[59:06.77]Smugglers around the enemy below waterfront.
[59:19.91]Engines of war.
[59:20.54]We'll try it on hard.
[59:21.22]I'm going to get my ass kicked, but, you know, whatever, right?
[59:26.28]Let's find a game.
[59:36.06]So I'll take that as a no, we can't join you.
[59:37.84]I mean, if you just... Just queue up.
[59:40.84]Queue up for Engines of War on hard.
[59:42.62]There's not very many people playing the game right now.
[59:44.42]You know what I mean?
[59:46.82]Like, just... If you're in the game right now, just queue up for that on hard.
[59:50.71]And if you're, you know, in the United States, I'm sure I'll meet up with you.
[60:00.77]Thanks for the sub, shoutout.
[60:01.89]Oh, Mr. Twigman!
[60:05.77]Welcome to the new year.
[60:06.91]Welcome to the 2016 year.
[60:08.39]I will only resub if you finish your bio.
[60:12.79]I'm never finishing my bio.
[60:15.61]It's never gonna happen.
[60:16.73]I don't want anyone to know who I was.
[60:19.09]I wasn't gonna come to the channel and just be like, who the fuck is this guy?
[60:21.45]I'm gonna read his bio and be like, fine, bye.
[60:24.46]Doesn't have a shit here.
[60:30.94]I can't even play M&M's Beach Party, guys.
[60:35.49]You want me to play M&Ms?
[60:36.29]You want me to play a game for the original Nintendo Wii?
[60:40.44]How am I supposed to hook that up?
[60:41.46]I can't hook that shit up.
[60:43.98]I don't even have that in here.
[60:47.99]I think I, like, broke that disc in half, by the way.
[60:50.17]I don't even know where it is.
[60:59.15]Just give me somewhere to donate to you.
[61:01.67]Not unnecessary.
[61:03.57]Your subscription, or you're already subscribed.
[61:06.41]That's... That's good enough for me.
[61:10.18]More than enough for me.
[61:11.38]So, thank you.
[61:13.46]Don't worry about it.
[61:14.32]Are you watching the stream?
[61:15.44]Is this guy watching the stream?
[61:17.70]I wonder.
[61:18.84]If you're watching the stream, turn and nod.
[61:24.53]That wasn't a nod.
[61:27.85]I'm on to you.
[61:30.31]Come on to you, you little snake.
[61:34.29]Yeah, you gonna watch the stream?
[61:36.39]You think you can play this game and watch the stream?
[61:38.47]Don't you block it, me!
[61:39.37]Alright, first person to fall off wins.
[61:44.25]I fucking won.
[61:54.60]Look at how hard that would fucking hurt.
[61:57.66]Imagine how much this would hurt, man.
[61:58.78]Just like... Hey, calm down.
[62:06.26]I said calm down.
[62:11.67]Let's do it.
[62:11.91]Do you remember you dummy?
[62:16.97]What?
[62:17.97]Why am I a dummy?
[62:20.01]What did I do to deserve that?
[62:30.80]This is on hard.
[62:31.40]So, this is gonna be hard.
[62:35.92]I want to give more money to you.
[62:37.14]Is it really so hard?
[62:37.84]I just want you to have my dollars.
[62:39.54]Well, I... It's a weird... I'm in a weird spot with that.
[62:47.87]I don't know.
[62:49.63]I don't know.
[62:50.43]You guys know how I feel about that.
[62:53.37]I just like to make videos and play games and stream sometimes.
[62:59.88]And make videos and hang out.
[63:01.29]I don't like... I don't care.
[63:03.97]I don't want this stream or my YouTube channel to be about how much money I can make.
[63:12.15]It's never really been about that.
[63:14.93]And I know some people will say, like, what the fuck are you talking about?
[63:17.43]What are you, stupid?
[63:18.30]Yeah.
[63:20.30]I'm pretty fucking stupid.
[63:21.38]It has nothing to do with it, though.
[63:23.60]How dare you?
[63:34.11]There's been a new development.
[63:36.51]Ratmen engineers are hard at work out in the forest.
[63:39.79]Hey, everyone talking shit about me streaming?
[63:42.81]I've streamed every single day in 2016 so far.
[63:44.95]What's that?
[63:45.37]Every single second of 2016.
[63:45.97]How many streamers do you know that can say that they've streamed every single second of 2016?
[63:49.77]That's tough to come by, man.
[64:09.14]Well, Optimistic Pig, thanks for sticking around and hanging out and watching.
[64:14.51]I like that guy's voice.
[64:16.41]Wild.
[64:16.67]Untamed.
[64:17.01]The acting in this game is actually really good.
[64:21.43]They say a lot of interesting things and they're very good at it.
[64:44.14]Oh, you guys aren't even dead?
[64:52.55]What?
[64:54.29]Rat.
[64:54.61]Left 4 Dead Rats Edition.
[64:56.97]I'm gonna do some sniping.
[65:00.40]I like just sitting back and shooting.
[65:04.12]It's fun.
[65:06.13]Ooh, that was a headshot.
[65:07.05]I got that, dude.
[65:07.65]That was an armored guy, too.
[65:08.65]I'm proud of that one.
[65:10.73]I'm very proud of that one.
[65:21.48]That's so satisfying.
[65:22.24]When you get the big club in the head and they explode their heads, it's great.
[65:26.38]Like that.
[65:29.74]Whoa, whoa, easy.
[65:48.18]I have not tried the Steam Controller.
[65:49.64]I don't know if I'd even like to either.
[65:52.66]I just, I don't really have a necessary reason why I'd want to use it.
[65:58.34]Oh, we're getting kind of split up here.
[66:00.14]Rattling gun?
[66:06.65]Shit!
[66:06.89]No!
[66:19.28]That was lucky.
[66:26.76]Oh, he's dead.
[66:27.14]I got him.
[66:29.91]This is actually 90 FOV, believe it or not.
[66:32.33]Somebody asked if it was 120.
[66:33.93]It feels like it is, but it's not.
[66:36.11]That's why I made it 85.
[66:36.83]It's up here!
[66:47.29]Advanced trackpad.
[66:48.13]Yeah, it's an interesting idea.
[66:51.02]But I... I just don't... When I play a game, right?
[66:54.24]If I have a controller or if I'm using keyboard and mouse... I don't really necessarily care or need an in-between.
[67:03.22]I don't mind using a controller.
[67:04.64]I don't mind using a keyboard and mouse.
[67:08.74]I don't know.
[67:09.10]I feel like it's kind of an in-between with the Steam controller.
[67:20.68]I'm sure it's cool.
[67:27.00]I just don't have a necessary reason to use it.
[67:43.51]I'm splitting up here.
[67:46.31]Now the interesting thing about this game is there's these things called tomes and grimoires.
[67:52.42]Grimoires, however you want to say it.
[67:55.22]Where they give you bonus opportunity to get gear with more dice that have higher chance to roll face up.
[68:02.55]But if you pick up a grimoire, grimoire, I know, I'm just, I have to say it like that and I'm going to die.
[68:10.35]It lowers your health by a pretty large margin and there's two in each level.
[68:15.33]So if you really want to try super duper hard, you pick up both Grimms and you end up with like 30% HP.
[68:22.68]And it is hard.
[68:26.56]Whoa.
[68:28.34]Whoa.
[68:28.98]Whoa.
[68:33.46]Stay down.
[68:36.24]Grimoire.
[68:37.40]Grimoire.
[68:38.74]Grimoire.
[68:40.68]Grimoire.
[68:41.24]Grimoire.
[68:43.50]Grimoire.
[68:50.53]Is that an assassin that I hear?
[68:51.65]It is, it is.
[68:52.39]I thought the dwarf was an assassin.
[68:59.22]I feel like we're missing somebody.
[69:00.30]One thing I wish you could turn on in this game... Metallix mentioned this as well when we were playing before.
[69:06.71]I wish I could turn on faint, kind of permanent outlines.
[69:09.89]Because sometimes it is hard to deter.
[69:11.11]Like, for instance, the dwarf.
[69:13.27]A lot of times I just turn around and think the dwarf is a rat.
[69:16.49]Because he's like the same size and has the same body shape.
[69:20.10]Oh yeah.
[69:21.66]That's what I'm talking about.
[69:36.03]Oof.
[69:36.11]Do you feel it?
[69:45.92]You can turn on promo outlines?
[69:47.26]Where is it?
[69:49.20]I didn't see it in the options menu.
[69:58.75]There is an always outline button?
[70:02.47]Hold on a second.
[70:03.77]Cover me.
[70:04.15]I want to investigate this.
[70:07.48]Mouse sensitivity.
[70:08.30]Weapon switch.
[70:09.52]Dodge jump.
[70:10.22]Dodge on diagonal.
[70:11.14]Double tap dodge.
[70:12.00]Disable in-game tutorials.
[70:14.23]Player outlines on.
[70:16.19]It's on.
[70:19.67]Oh!
[70:23.95]Oh!
[70:25.91]Would you look at that?
[70:28.03]I thought it was either on or off.
[70:32.16]I didn't know there was another one.
[70:40.22]I don't know, but that's a little too much, though.
[70:43.30]We'll try it for a little bit.
[70:45.82]I wish I could... Okay, somebody else correct me.
[70:55.95]Can I make that even fainter?
[70:57.57]Or probably not.
[71:04.71]That is much, much better.
[71:06.23]But I wish it was a little lighter.
[71:13.54]Yeah, I mean, I saw, I looked at it, it said on.
[71:16.78]And I was like, oh, on, and I figured on or off.
[71:19.02]I didn't know there was also, like, super on.
[71:23.99]Yeah, we have on, off, or super on.
[71:26.37]Whoa, you guys came out of nowhere.
[71:47.54]We're in bad position here.
[71:49.42]None of us have very much health.
[72:27.06]That's a tank.
[72:28.18]And look at our health.
[72:29.48]This is not going to be good.
[72:31.31]This is not going to be good.
[72:33.05]Wow.
[72:48.40]God, you guys just come out of nowhere.
[72:49.56]Fuck off.
[73:04.98]Yeah, this game is not easy.
[73:08.69]Hard is actually hard.
[73:10.19]And then there are two other difficulties harder than this.
[73:13.53]There is Nightmare and Cataclysm.
[73:17.03]I don't even want to know what this game is like on Cataclysm.
[73:19.89]And if you do the grimoires.
[73:25.01]I don't even know how difficult that game is going to be.
[73:27.36]There we go.
[73:27.74]We've healed up a little bit.
[73:29.16]I could have missed that really.
[73:30.40]How is that possible?
[73:31.96]Make sure I don't get wrapped around.
[73:50.71]How we doing?
[73:53.50]Assassin.
[73:55.76]Very nice.
[73:56.64]Very nice.
[73:57.38]That was a good shot.
[73:58.48]With the shotgun from up here, you get a plus one.
[74:04.01]You get a plus one super skill.
[74:17.01]Holy charges With me
[74:43.43]Let's get some barrels.
[74:44.47]Are we just gonna go as a team or are we gonna wait and get a couple of them?
[74:57.28]What are we doing?
[75:04.45]Is it okay if I drop some pickup lines in here so I can... You can do whatever you want, man.
[75:18.97]Get out of here.
[75:29.81]I love how sometimes they just run around looking at you like, who do I hit?
[75:35.33]Who do I hit?
[75:35.71]I don't know who to hit.
[75:43.70]Where's the last one go over there somewhere?
[75:45.38]Let's carry it.
[75:48.36]Let's go, man.
[75:56.21]Watch out!
[75:59.35]Hey, stop procrastinating.
[76:00.57]Guy that just asked about procrastinating, stop procrastinating.
[76:03.13]Stop doing that.
[76:03.97]Don't procrastinate anymore.
[76:05.47]Do it today.
[76:05.99]Do it right now.
[76:08.97]Just close the stream.
[76:11.75]And... Hold on.
[76:12.63]I don't want him to shoot the barrel.
[76:14.58]Because they can shoot the barrels, and they can screw everything up.
[76:20.66]I wish I could get the fuck out of here.
[76:36.79]And three!
[76:37.19]Whoo!
[76:37.61]He could have got it done last year.
[76:38.81]Well, he waited a year.
[77:08.26]That guy's got a lot of people fighting him.
[77:23.38]I love the big swing.
[77:24.36]It's great.
[77:24.90]It feels so fun just to hit people with it.
[77:30.42]He's doing some sweeping.
[77:32.00]You're heavy for an elf.
[77:40.66]Oh, I was trying to do something fucking silly.
[77:45.81]Don't you know, never do anything silly when you're on hard.
[77:48.51]Yeah, Warhammer is a universe.
[77:54.46]And they license it out for different developers to make different games.
[77:59.14]So every Warhammer game that you play is not made by the same company.
[78:04.44]It's kind of here or there.
[78:07.15]Some of my favorite RTS games ever were the 40k series, Warhammer 40,000.
[78:11.89]Dawn of War was probably one of my favorite RTS games.
[78:24.22]That's a lot of stuff.
[78:30.21]I remember just playing as the Tau.
[78:37.32]Somebody else, just pick that up, man.
[78:39.26]I already got one.
[78:41.72]This is a lot of... Sanity.
[78:45.66]Wow, we just cleared that out.
[78:51.80]Nobody gonna take that?
[78:52.52]Nobody take that?
[78:53.54]I mean, fine, I'll just heal.
[78:56.26]I'll heal and I'll take it.
[78:59.92]Sigma wants us to raid this town of Bermin.
[79:06.02]Game of the year was Bloodborne.
[79:10.32]Bloodborne, Victivran, and probably Binding of Isaac.
[79:17.09]I didn't really play a whole lot of the top big games in 2000.
[79:19.57]Ooh, a tomb.
[79:23.83]A tomb!
[79:26.49]Well, I'm going to grab the tomb.
[79:30.86]We have two tombs.
[79:32.74]We have two tombs.
[79:34.20]A tomb for our health.
[79:36.29]Somebody do that.
[79:39.31]Somebody eat that.
[79:46.68]Fallout 4?
[79:47.24]I don't think Fallout 4 was a game of the year.
[79:49.56]I wouldn't put Fallout 4 in the top five.
[79:52.58]Yes!
[80:10.54]I can't believe they put an entire Egyptian tomb in that book.
[80:15.09]I like saying tomb.
[80:17.61]Tome.
[80:18.05]No, it's tomb.
[80:21.07]The tomb of unknown secrets.
[80:24.45]Need ammo.
[80:31.61]I don't think Fallout 4 was a bad game, but I don't think it was necessarily a great game.
[80:35.79]Let's put it this way.
[80:38.10]I don't think Fallout 4 was game of the year good.
[80:42.00]I just don't.
[80:43.74]It wasn't a bad game.
[80:45.60]It just means it wasn't the best game I've ever played.
[80:48.49]I am not even close.
[81:11.59]I want to go inside.
[81:12.95]This is a bad idea.
[81:16.62]This didn't do anything for me.
[81:17.74]All this did was just get me stuck.
[81:21.02]This is not the right way.
[81:27.45]Are we not going up here?
[81:33.63]Apparently not.
[81:46.16]I haven't put enough time into undertale I I've played undertale I have for a couple hours but I have holy I haven't put enough time into undertale to say it was the best game like of the year I just haven't been able to determine that because I haven't played it for more than a couple hours
[82:16.53]down there.
[82:17.99]Geez.
[82:19.63]Why do I need bullets?
[82:21.63]This is not good.
[82:22.45]Not good.
[82:23.99]Not good.
[82:24.49]Not good.
[82:25.37]I don't know what to do here.
[82:27.17]Not good.
[82:27.71]We gotta... Yeah, I gotta leave.
[82:30.24]We gotta... No.
[82:31.70]I gotta jump down.
[82:36.64]Too many gunners.
[82:37.80]Can't go back up there.
[82:38.98]She's just gone.
[82:39.54]Look at our max health, by the way.
[82:43.10]That is what happens when you pick up the two tombs.
[82:46.26]We have no health.
[82:59.31]There she is.
[83:06.90]Oh geez!
[83:08.38]Does anybody have any guns, any ammo?
[83:12.92]That's a terrible place for him to be.
[83:16.54]How the fuck are we gonna get through that?
[83:21.98]Gosh darn it!
[83:23.44]No!
[83:24.08]Rocked right into a pack guy!
[83:28.48]And I am still alive.
[83:30.34]Miraculously.
[83:36.38]I was just trying to block the attack so they could go.
[83:38.38]Trying to jump.
[83:41.14]Oh, we're in deep shit here.
[83:42.38]Those two machine gunners being spawned right behind us there was the worst thing that could have happened.
[83:47.91]This guy.
[83:48.31]Good luck to this guy.
[83:50.09]Yeah, it's game over.
[83:52.57]That is a game over.
[83:58.20]Oh, well.
[84:09.45]Hey, cool.
[84:11.27]I can upgrade that item.
[84:19.97]Dark Souls 3.
[84:21.71]Looking forward to other things.
[84:22.83]Yeah, Dark Souls 3 for sure.
[84:29.53]Oh, let's just try it again.
[84:30.71]We kind of got a bad deal there.
[84:42.80]Never go to Grimms with pubs.
[84:47.71]It's hard.
[84:48.71]Oh, Italics wants to play.
[84:51.21]Italics wants to play the video game called Vermintide.
[84:55.93]Alright, Italics, we'll get you in the next one.
[84:58.09]Is that cool?
[85:02.30]Because I jest, like these guys jest, Jordan.
[85:06.22]Not like more than 15, 20 minutes ago.
[85:08.80]The forest is screaming.
[85:10.34]She knows she is invaded.
[85:21.14]Oh, by the way, italics there.
[85:22.37]Look it.
[85:22.81]Do you see something?
[85:23.53]Do you notice something?
[85:25.15]Do you notice the always on outlines?
[85:29.11]It was actually in the options.
[85:31.46]We just didn't even see it.
[85:33.20]It was another option to keep it always on.
[85:36.60]Rather than just on sometimes.
[85:45.70]You guys don't all have to leave.
[85:47.66]I'm not kicking you guys out.
[85:50.16]We need to free up one spot.
[85:51.24]You guys are going to have to do rock, paper, scissors.
[85:56.91]Rock, paper, uh, rock, paper, vermintide.
[86:00.21]Whoa, he just appeared in my face.
[86:05.27]You guys all saw that.
[86:07.79]That was odd.
[86:08.23]Okay.
[86:28.88]That could've been worse.
[86:32.10]Could've been worse.
[86:59.98]Watch your six!
[87:06.44]Where are the healing things?
[87:13.88]Is there only one or two?
[87:19.22]Some of you guys are quick.
[87:20.50]This guy with the bow, you are quick, man.
[87:23.33]I thought I was going to kill that guy.
[87:28.37]you are a quick one up here no door ring fortune over here
[87:56.66]Okay, I saw somebody say, I want this game, but I don't $25 want this game.
[87:59.53]Yeah, I mean, it's...
[88:04.14]It is, it is a... It's good.
[88:08.23]It's a full, done, complete 13 mission game with a bunch of items.
[88:15.25]I would say it's probably worth the $25 because it's not necessarily a... I'll play that game.
[88:23.41]I can complete that whole game in like an hour and 10 minutes.
[88:28.87]I mean, if you want to experience all the levels and play with the characters and get items, I think it's worth the $25 price tag.
[88:36.68]But, like you said, is it worth it for you?
[88:38.86]Is it worth the $25 for you?
[88:41.88]Which may or may not be the case.
[88:46.73]Okay.
[88:56.68]It does just follow the same Left 4 Dead formula.
[88:59.44]So if you got your fill out of Left 4 Dead and you don't really care about that type of game anymore, it's just a lot of the same shit.
[89:07.28]A astronomical amount of the same stuff.
[89:11.45]But if you ever thought to yourself, hey, a melee only, like 80% melee Left 4 Dead in Warhammer's storyline is a game that I think might be cool, then this is a game that you would want to play.
[89:38.89]We all shot him and he didn't die.
[89:40.85]Those guys have a lot of health.
[89:49.22]Yeah, there you go.
[89:50.84]It's worth $25 if you have a couple friends that also get it too.
[89:53.50]Because then you can all enjoy the game.
[89:59.67]I would say solo buying this game, it might be hard to get a group.
[90:03.30]Because it's not like the most popular game ever.
[90:07.62]People still play it, it still has pretty good numbers I think.
[90:15.55]So look at how many are on that bridge.
[90:18.49]Holy shit.
[90:33.29]Can I get him?
[90:42.11]Got him!
[90:48.60]I want this game with Lord of the Rings.
[90:49.78]Yeah, italics.
[90:50.48]That would be amazing.
[90:51.32]Yeah, that's a stash I will take.
[91:01.78]Hey, I could use one of those.
[91:14.51]They're adding a solo mode eventually?
[91:16.17]That's cool.
[91:20.44]I wonder what that would be like.
[91:25.78]I don't know what that would be like.
[91:34.09]He took that guy's head off.
[91:36.07]Don't worry about it.
[91:45.91]Thank you.
[91:46.73]Thank you, Foxy.
[91:49.22]You've been hitting some nice shots, too.
[91:59.00]We're all just skipping.
[92:01.26]There's a tomb.
[92:09.01]This is a fun game just to stream.
[92:11.57]Because you don't... It doesn't really require... I can just kind of sit here and just talk and hang out and just hit fucking rats with a hammer.
[92:19.84]It's a good stream.
[92:20.68]Look at that.
[92:22.76]Do you see the reaction time on this dude?
[92:25.44]Good fucking job.
[92:26.52]And here comes a tank.
[92:40.00]I don't want to get wrapped around.
[92:43.17]Shit.
[92:46.37]God.
[92:47.71]God, I'm on a fucking tree.
[92:49.47]Right in the head.
[92:50.57]Right in the head.
[93:06.37]I blocked that last second.
[93:07.57]Nice.
[93:08.47]The dwarf.
[93:08.83]He's got a Scottish accent.
[93:33.56]Where is he?
[93:35.52]I heard him.
[93:35.86]Oh, it was this guy.
[93:39.99]That guy just wouldn't die.
[93:42.05]Hattie!
[93:42.55]The Vermintide.
[93:45.39]I do like how this is pretty much always a one-hit kill, though.
[94:05.52]Very nice.
[94:06.20]Very nice.
[94:08.98]Very nice.
[94:10.20]We need more bombs.
[94:13.94]There's barely any.
[94:16.32]Hey, thanks for subbing, Panda.
[94:19.00]Panda man.
[94:20.40]Thanks for the sub.
[94:22.79]Thank you.
[94:23.57]And I'm probably missing... I don't even have any fucking shit.
[94:27.15]You know what I mean?
[94:28.43]I don't have any...
[94:32.89]sub notification for anything it's been like a hectic couple weeks though guys it lasts like three weeks there's been so many things I've wanted to do that I just haven't been able to for a thousand different reasons but you know that's life that's life
[94:56.69]Where are they going?
[95:01.34]We'll put it over here.
[95:02.62]Oh, he already got it.
[95:12.22]Oh, scup.
[95:12.76]Thanks for the sub.
[95:13.34]Thanks to anybody that subbed.
[95:17.87]I thought I missed.
[95:18.43]Let's go!
[95:28.18]I'm gonna kill that guy.
[95:29.04]I'm gonna hit that guy in the head.
[95:30.38]I gotta get that guy in his head.
[95:32.00]No, I hit the other guy next to him in the head.
[95:33.32]Oh, well.
[95:33.68]Forget it.
[95:33.98]We gotta kill some rats.
[95:48.61]Bang!
[95:49.43]Hey, Princess Awesome.
[95:52.11]Thanks for subbing.
[95:55.46]Thanks for the host.
[95:56.26]Thanks for the sub.
[95:57.12]Thanks for the sub.
[96:02.10]I got it.
[96:02.68]I got it.
[96:03.10]Nice.
[96:03.58]Let's get outta here.
[96:34.84]Damn it.
[96:35.18]I don't even know... I don't know why I'm shooting these little shits.
[96:39.70]I shouldn't be.
[96:40.70]Need to save those for special... special rats.
[96:58.36]Is he dead?
[96:58.80]I got him.
[97:01.46]I got him.
[97:02.64]Just watch your back.
[97:10.37]Oh, where is he?
[97:11.61]Come here.
[97:12.53]Hey, you.
[97:12.93]Hey, it's an achievement.
[97:28.99]There's also, I didn't even mention it, but there's a little dodge that you can do.
[97:33.01]You can do it backwards, you can do it forwards.
[97:35.01]Well, not forwards, you can do it backwards, left or right.
[97:38.53]It's like a mini dodge.
[97:39.57]It helps sometimes.
[97:47.79]Did we get a Grim?
[97:50.24]I think we did.
[97:50.72]It's going to be tough.
[97:53.02]We don't have any healing.
[97:53.80]Does anybody have a bomb?
[97:56.42]We got two bombs.
[97:57.44]We should be able to do this.
[98:01.10]And that should be is the question.
[98:03.76]Alrighty.
[98:12.71]Wow!
[98:17.21]We good?
[98:19.15]I think we're good.
[98:20.71]I think we're good.
[98:23.05]Am I excited for the Deadpool movie?
[98:25.37]Yeah.
[98:25.49]I don't know.
[98:26.19]Should we... Deadpool's cool.
[98:53.12]I think we've just had so many superhero movies over the last few years that I'm sort of desensitized to them all at this point.
[99:04.43]But, yeah, I mean, I'll watch it.
[99:13.97]You dwarves are bloodthirsty, folks.
[99:23.38]This is where we died last time, right?
[99:24.86]A little bit further past this.
[99:27.54]Let's make it past this one.
[99:29.16]Let's get out of this.
[99:40.59]It's an R-rated Marvel movie?
[99:42.71]Yeah.
[99:44.29]What, did he say potions?
[99:48.86]I will take one.
[99:50.96]Why not?
[99:57.49]Nice shot.
[100:00.33]Okay, we have two Grimms now.
[100:02.39]This is where we died last time.
[100:03.79]We gotta be very, very careful.
[100:06.45]This is exactly where we lost last time.
[100:08.43]With these two Grimms.
[100:19.07]I'm just scared of the tank.
[100:20.59]The tank will just ruin everything like it did last time.
[100:37.34]Okay.
[100:41.96]What movie are you excited for?
[100:43.16]A lot of the movies that I wanted to watch already came out.
[100:45.84]And I've already seen them.
[100:47.58]Hateful Eight.
[100:49.66]Star Wars.
[100:50.66]I've seen them.
[100:52.50]And, I mean, yeah.
[100:54.78]I heavily enjoyed them.
[100:57.38]I think I liked the Hateful Eight more than I liked Star Wars.
[101:03.99]I mean, I like Tarantino though.
[101:06.93]I'm a Tarantino guy.
[101:09.16]Tarantino kind of guy.
[101:14.96]Where is he?
[101:15.44]He's going to show up like right here.
[101:17.06]Nice.
[101:38.23]I did go to the 70mm showing.
[101:41.81]And it was glorious.
[101:42.86]Already have one.
[102:05.53]Tarantino's a weird guy.
[102:07.75]That's one way to describe it.
[102:08.83]I think we're almost out of the woods here.
[102:20.08]Where is he?
[102:31.63]I'm gonna go this way, I'm gonna go around.
[102:33.45]I don't wanna get stuck over here.
[102:35.49]Shitload of people coming this way.
[102:39.67]Where is he?
[102:40.23]Really?
[102:41.12]I thought I got you with that.
[103:01.71]Get away!
[103:04.03]Goodness!
[103:06.27]Tarantino also loves closing car trunks.
[103:10.51]There's a lot of things that Tarantino likes to do.
[103:12.91]That's in almost every movie, right?
[103:28.82]Just make sure they're dead.
[103:29.62]You gotta hit them twice.
[103:37.61]It should be close to the end here.
[103:39.30]Okay.
[104:01.53]Do we still have two tombs?
[104:05.39]Two tombs?
[104:07.19]What's over there?
[104:08.77]Actually, wait a minute.
[104:12.73]No.
[104:12.91]You need this.
[104:13.83]Come here.
[104:17.89]You need that more than I do.
[104:23.38]You needed that way more than I did.
[104:36.32]One more Tomb of Defend event and you're done, yeah.
[104:42.82]Well, let's hope we do it.
[104:44.16]I just get so self-conscious.
[104:47.66]Yeah, this is it.
[104:48.96]When we have this few health...
[104:52.31]Ah, it just makes me so nervous.
[104:54.51]Because there's no buffer.
[104:56.03]You take a couple hits like this and you're just done.
[104:59.33]You get too nervous like this.
[105:01.07]I don't like doing two of the rims.
[105:02.34]As much as it's awesome to get items, it's just scary.
[105:06.42]Especially not hard.
[105:07.52]It's okay, we'll be alright.
[105:12.20]We gotta have more confidence, right?
[105:23.00]Just get to full health.
[105:25.42]Pick up the tombs.
[105:28.33]Another health over here.
[105:30.07]If somebody gets dire, they can go grab it.
[105:32.49]What about ammo?
[105:33.17]I could really use some.
[105:34.25]Gunner up top.
[105:36.87]Okay, well he's dead.
[105:41.42]Anything else?
[105:42.04]Any ammo?
[105:43.98]Where's the ammo?
[105:50.27]We all need to stand somewhere.
[105:51.89]To the cellar?
[105:52.45]We're going in the cellar?
[105:54.81]Is that the strategy?
[105:59.12]I guess it is.
[105:59.72]I guess we're going into the basement.
[106:02.60]Look at this.
[106:02.94]What if a tank comes in here?
[106:04.04]I remember back in Left 4 Dead days, we used to do the bathroom strat.
[106:09.62]Where all four people would stuff into one of the tiny bathrooms.
[106:14.45]And it worked for about a minute or two.
[106:18.11]Until a tank came.
[106:19.09]And a tank would just come into the bathroom and everybody would die.
[106:21.59]But it was fun while... The bathroom strat was fun while it lasted.
[106:26.43]They won't know we're in here.
[106:27.23]Just keep... Everyone will be quiet.
[106:29.59]We'll just wait for the boat.
[106:34.10]I love shit like this, man.
[106:35.44]This is like my favorite thing about games like this.
[106:37.56]Like, we're in the cellar.
[106:40.48]Everyone shut up.
[106:41.22]They have to come through one door.
[106:49.38]They're just phasing through.
[106:50.96]What the fuck is happening?
[106:55.71]Why?
[106:56.23]I was just getting stuck inside of it.
[107:08.87]No one's trying to open it.
[107:09.96]Just open the door!
[107:12.24]You don't have to do this!
[107:21.21]Uh-oh.
[107:22.39]Easy.
[107:31.35]The one that was just stuck flailing around.
[107:34.44]What the fuck was that?
[107:36.76]See you.
[107:40.94]See you, guys.
[107:51.07]I'm so confused.
[107:56.45]Getting a lot of kills right now, though.
[108:07.40]Who's shooting the gun?
[108:09.38]Why do I hear a machine gun?
[108:14.55]This isn't good.
[108:20.99]This works.
[108:24.56]It's all the green goo.
[108:33.20]Let's go.
[108:34.48]Anybody else?
[108:38.64]Anybody else?
[108:42.86]Hey, we did it.
[108:48.56]I got to get this guy.
[108:49.14]I got to get him.
[108:49.74]Damn it.
[108:51.84]Okay, nice work.
[108:56.39]GG!
[108:58.81]That was an interesting strategy.
[109:00.05]So we're gonna have a lot of chances to roll.
[109:07.12]Which is good.
[109:10.52]We get a legendary.
[109:12.40]Whatever they're called.
[109:13.00]Exotic.
[109:17.56]Come on.
[109:18.06]Come on.
[109:18.96]How many do I need?
[109:19.76]One, two, three, four.
[109:21.38]Let's go.
[109:21.76]Come on.
[109:25.30]Shit.
[109:27.70]Shit.
[109:29.78]That's a trinket though, right?
[109:31.00]Is it?
[109:31.34]What the fuck?
[109:36.94]Engineer's tools?
[109:39.34]When throwing a grenade, there is a 15% chance that it won't be consumed.
[109:44.27]Hold on a second.
[109:45.03]I need to look at this.
[109:48.43]Hey, happy new year to all of you central time zone people.
[109:57.02]There was a blue trinket right above it.
[110:04.38]So what does that do?
[110:08.53]Engineerist tools.
[110:12.05]So I can just equip it.
[110:16.50]So what is the trait?
[110:18.42]So I have to unlock that?
[110:21.28]No, I guess I don't.
[110:22.80]So that's just... Hold on a second.
[110:27.49]That's kind of cool.
[110:28.59]Can I upgrade it?
[110:29.29]Where is it?
[110:48.10]Where is it?
[110:52.24]I guess you can't upgrade because it's already there.
[110:54.68]You need to equip a trade.
[110:56.92]Tools of the trade.
[110:59.68]I guess that's kind of cool, but... That means that there's a more... Most of the time when you throw a grenade, randomly sometimes, it's not going to get consumed.
[111:15.80]But, I mean, does it really matter?
[111:18.46]What's my favorite Tarantino movie besides Pulp Fiction?
[111:20.48]Because that one's too easy.
[111:23.22]We talked about this the other day.
[111:24.30]Like ranking Tarantino movies.
[111:27.79]I don't know.
[111:30.01]It's hard to say.
[111:32.31]But was... I'm trying to think of like... Kill Bill.
[111:38.38]The first Kill Bill was pretty cool.
[111:41.02]All Kill Bill was interesting.
[111:55.32]I need to look at like a list of like all the Quentin Tarantino movies he's directed and produced.
[112:00.99]Reservoir Dogs is an easy one to say too, but probably Reservoir Dogs or Kill Bill.
[112:07.54]All right, it's Alex.
[112:10.36]You want to play a video game maybe?
[112:26.37]Quinton.
[112:27.65]Italics, are you in the chat?
[112:29.69]Yeah, you are.
[112:33.62]I liked The Hateful Eight, man.
[112:34.78]I thought The Hateful Eight was one of his better movies.
[112:37.26]I really do.
[112:38.73]It's just, I like the whole... I'm not gonna obviously talk about plot points, but that whole movie, just like how it's like, oh, you've got these eight people, and they're all different people, and they're all fucking weirdos, and they all have their own stories, and who's the ones you can trust?
[112:55.40]Who are the good guys?
[112:56.06]Who are the bad guys?
[112:57.12]I like that dynamic.
[112:58.78]It's very interesting.
[113:06.16]I like Kurt Russell.
[113:07.38]I like Samuel L. Jackson.
[113:11.24]It's just a good movie.
[113:12.26]I recommend you see it.
[113:25.21]Okay, let me just very briefly do this.
[113:35.33]Uh, Talix, can you invite me to a game?
[113:40.59]While we, uh, turn on dog cam?
[113:44.17]We're gonna do dog cam while Talix invites me to a video game.
[113:49.33]Okay, guys, you ready for the... Oh, he's, like, sleeping, too.
[113:51.89]This is gonna be really cute.
[113:54.28]Hey, there you go.
[113:54.82]He's asleep.
[113:57.70]There he is, sleeping.
[114:01.02]Uh, invite me to a game, Talix, if you can.
[114:06.57]Well, we see Otto the Sleepy Dog.
[114:08.23]Am I a fan of Clue?
[114:14.96]Yes.
[114:15.52]That is a great movie.
[114:24.54]Look at how he's just, it's stuffy.
[114:25.58]He's like a little blanky dog.
[114:26.92]Oh, oh, hold on.
[114:31.30]Uh, he's gonna hide now.
[114:33.94]He's gonna hide.
[114:43.89]See, he does that in bed, too.
[114:45.05]Like, when he sleeps in my bed with me.
[114:47.93]And he just stuffs into the covers and just sleeps under the covers with me.
[114:51.19]He's a great dog.
[114:52.42]I'm so glad he's okay.
[114:54.00]He's a good boy.
[114:55.66]My little Otto.
[114:58.14]Uh, Talix, do you want to speak on the internet telephone?
[115:03.47]Would you want to do that for, like, a round or two?
[115:06.03]It's up to you.
[115:06.69]You write in the chat if you want to speak on the internet telephone for, like, an hour.
[115:18.48]Because I will join the internet telephone if you want me to.
[115:24.06]Okay, he's currently in the internet telephone.
[115:34.27]Here we go.
[115:36.53]I don't know if people can hear you or not.
[115:37.61]Let's find out.
[115:38.11]Yeah.
[115:43.43]Yeah.
[115:44.83]Hey, Happy New Year, dude.
[115:46.59]It's just 12.07, your time.
[115:50.33]Yeah.
[115:55.16]Now people should be able to hear you.
[115:57.86]Dude, Happy New Year.
[115:59.22]Oh, goody.
[116:00.86]Happy New Year.
[116:01.90]Welcome to the new fucking... Oh, now I've got to get used to writing 2016.
[116:04.86]Ha, that's the New Year joke.
[116:07.93]Shut up.
[116:08.65]Shut up with that.
[116:11.35]I've got to lower you a little bit, I think.
[116:15.08]Where are you?
[116:17.52]Where the hell are you?
[116:19.07]Say some words.
[116:21.19]Hey everybody, what's going on?
[116:22.33]My name is Jerma985.
[116:23.31]We're here with another TF2 gameplay commentary.
[116:25.91]He's gone.
[116:27.71]Yeah, you're good.
[116:29.35]You're good.
[116:31.69]Okay, let's go back to reality here.
[116:37.36]What would you like to do?
[116:39.00]Doesn't matter to me.
[116:42.75]I want to play as the Witch Hunter.
[116:47.51]I'm going to be Witch Hunter.
[116:52.53]Salt Spire.
[116:57.30]What mission have you not done?
[117:00.16]I've only done two or three.
[117:02.28]So like there's ten...
[117:05.41]I have not done Smuggler's Run or Black Powder.
[117:11.26]Oh, really?
[117:14.98]So take your pick.
[117:16.40]I would do either one of those is good.
[117:20.63]Whatever one you feel like doing.
[117:23.45]Let's give Black Powder a try.
[117:26.49]Do you want to go ahead and begin or do you want to wait?
[117:33.79]Uh, if those are the guys that we're playing.
[117:35.87]If you guys queue up for Black Bob.
[117:37.33]Difficulty, easy!
[117:38.33]Oops, sorry.
[117:39.43]Hang on, hold on.
[117:40.08]What is this, what is this, baby time?
[117:41.64]Hold on a second, Italics, I got a toy for you.
[117:43.52]Hey, usually I'm not the one that queues for this, so I gotta get used to it.
[117:49.86]What the crap is that?
[117:51.16]It's my fuckin' baby cell phone.
[117:52.70]Are you gonna tickle me, Elmo?
[117:54.02]Listen.
[117:58.94]Yeah, see?
[118:01.16]There, is that better?
[118:04.40]Yeah, we'll do normal.
[118:05.32]That's fine.
[118:05.68]Do you want to do hard?
[118:11.71]Do you want to do hard?
[118:12.79]It's up to you.
[118:13.31]I don't know.
[118:13.71]Is that like you normally do hard?
[118:15.41]I'll do whatever you normally do.
[118:16.53]Do hard.
[118:17.03]Do hard.
[118:17.69]Let's make it hard.
[118:19.05]Okay.
[118:21.49]So this guy, this is the witch hunter.
[118:23.30]Witch hunter has these two guns that go bang, bang, bang, bang, bang.
[118:28.79]He's very quick with his shooting.
[118:30.89]And he's got the pilgrim hat.
[118:32.87]Yes.
[118:33.29]I think he's my favorite voiced character.
[118:37.32]I just like how he talks.
[118:38.54]Let's go and save the kingdom.
[118:40.28]I actually kind of want to try the wizard again.
[118:48.91]Wizard's fun.
[118:50.05]It's just hard.
[118:50.61]I don't know.
[118:51.17]It's hard to play.
[118:52.59]I want to try the new electric wizard.
[118:58.10]There we go, we got somebody joining.
[119:01.24]If you're currently playing the game and you'd like to play, just queue up for Black Powder Hard.
[119:07.11]I'm sure it's in the server browser as well.
[119:10.69]It's the one with two or three people in it right now.
[119:12.45]He's great!
[119:20.74]I love all the voices in this game.
[119:22.34]They're great.
[119:24.14]Can you do, like, voice commands?
[119:25.40]How do you do emote?
[119:26.52]I don't know.
[119:27.38]I don't think you can.
[119:28.06]I think they just kind of do it whenever they feel like it.
[119:30.22]Oh.
[119:30.32]I thought maybe there was, like, a this way.
[119:34.86]Or... Alright, we're ready to go.
[119:45.79]Kiss me, it's midnight.
[119:47.13]Is there a mistletoe?
[119:48.07]Are we past the mistletoe time?
[119:49.67]Mistletoe?
[119:50.19]This is not Christmas, man.
[119:55.49]I like when you swing the sword, how you kind of stop in midair and you... Ready to go?
[120:04.54]Yeah, I'm ready.
[120:06.84]This game... Not this game.
[120:07.82]This sword has a lot of stamina on it.
[120:13.33]A lot of stamina on it?
[120:14.53]What does that mean?
[120:15.11]It can block a lot of attacks.
[120:17.25]A lot of shields?
[120:18.09]Yes.
[120:18.25]Which one is this?
[120:19.03]Reaper clone.
[120:19.71]What mission is this?
[120:21.51]Black Powder, I think.
[120:23.37]On hard mode.
[120:24.21]Oh boy.
[120:38.10]This is my first time on hard mode.
[120:40.60]Oh, well.
[120:42.33]Be gentle.
[120:44.07]Wouldn't you like to know?
[120:45.13]How's that guy already moving?
[120:50.81]Did you just escape through that?
[120:52.08]I don't know.
[120:52.76]I was just watching the cutscene.
[120:56.84]Well, I'm gonna do one thing real quick.
[120:58.30]Hold on.
[120:58.64]Let me see what happens here.
[120:59.96]If the stream goes down for a second, I apologize profusely.
[121:04.10]Let's see what happens.
[121:05.40]Ladies and gentlemen, the stream might just turn off.
[121:07.99]I will turn it back on, though.
[121:09.05]I promise.
[121:09.47]Did it work?
[121:10.59]Did it work?
[121:10.95]Are we still alive?
[121:11.55]Because I put it up to 40 frames a second.
[121:28.74]40?
[121:29.02]Yeah.
[121:29.84]What is that going to look like on stream?
[121:31.56]I've never seen that before.
[121:33.27]Did the frame rate increase?
[121:37.25]Can you not stream this at 60?
[121:38.23]I wonder if that's anything.
[121:45.91]I mean, I probably could try.
[121:47.98]But for some reason I was on 30.
[121:49.92]I don't know why.
[121:50.58]It might have been the last thing I was recording.
[121:54.02]Just like a dwarf.
[121:56.57]I don't actually want to know what that looks like.
[121:59.79]I've never seen a 40 frame per second stream.
[122:02.29]This is the first one ever.
[122:03.29]I just didn't know if you could do it on the fly.
[122:08.05]I need to restart the stream to do the FPS change.
[122:17.90]Maybe I'll restart the stream.
[122:19.74]Oh, whatever.
[122:20.14]Who cares?
[122:20.58]Is this the whole mission right here?
[122:24.26]Yes, this is the whole mission.
[122:34.48]So, do you have any experience with using the bolt staff?
[122:38.94]Zero.
[122:41.16]Because the default basic attack seems kind of weak.
[122:45.36]What about the charge up?
[122:48.50]Pretty long charge up.
[122:50.28]It's been on 30.
[122:51.10]I didn't know it was on 30.
[122:52.48]I usually stream at 40 or 45.
[122:55.04]Has it been bad looking?
[122:56.61]Or has it been just somewhat normal looking?
[123:01.81]Were you watching earlier?
[123:04.22]I was not watching on Source, so I can't really answer that question very well.
[123:08.57]I've been trying to stream when I stream at at least 40.
[123:13.93]Why was it at 30?
[123:14.61]I wonder what the hell that was for.
[123:21.10]Oh, jeez.
[123:28.51]Whoa!
[123:29.03]People behind me.
[123:36.74]You do take fall damage in this game.
[123:38.02]Yes.
[123:42.16]We need to pick up some barrels.
[123:44.96]I don't want to leave this guy alone.
[123:46.12]I just got tackled, but it's okay.
[123:49.52]I got someone covering me.
[123:51.00]There's three guards up here, though, so that's not good.
[123:54.34]We need to try to get two at a time.
[123:59.59]There's one up top, all the way up top.
[124:01.00]You going for the one all the way up top?
[124:04.76]Ow.
[124:05.82]Yeah, but I'm getting a little low.
[124:07.24]Alright, I got the one up top.
[124:16.65]Raging Man, yeah, I'm getting pushed around a little bit.
[124:20.69]I'm getting bullied.
[124:22.39]Is this the first one?
[124:24.57]Is this number one?
[124:26.91]Oh, wow.
[124:30.21]That almost is bad.
[124:31.27]Holy crap.
[124:32.13]And a tank.
[124:32.59]And we have one barrel.
[124:35.59]It's coming after me!
[124:39.81]I can heal you in a second here.
[124:41.87]Once we kill this guy.
[124:45.89]I'm guessing jumping in the water is not good.
[124:47.96]No, no, it's not good.
[124:49.82]He's dead.
[124:50.94]Alright, come over here.
[124:54.16]You're the Bright Wizard, right?
[124:56.00]Yes.
[124:59.17]Well, that didn't go off because I got hit.
[125:05.73]Hey, there we go.
[125:07.49]Thank you.
[125:17.10]Trying not to suck.
[125:19.36]Is there any... Even the sound cues are kind of like Left 4 Dead.
[125:23.52]Yeah, that's actually one of the things I like about it.
[125:26.31]Because it feels sort of familiar, but still unique.
[125:31.25]Yeah, it's very, very familiar, but it's still fun.
[125:40.45]How many do we have?
[125:40.97]Two to three?
[125:41.49]Three to four?
[125:42.25]Three to eight?
[125:43.21]Ah!
[125:43.67]Ah!
[125:43.93]Get away from me!
[125:46.15]Get away from me!
[125:52.34]How the fuck did you get over there?
[125:57.31]I hear an assassin, and I'm terrified right now.
[125:59.21]I need to come over to you guys.
[126:01.99]He jumped right past you, and then down.
[126:04.03]Yeah, he's right here.
[126:04.93]No, not past you.
[126:05.61]He jumped past the barrel guy.
[126:07.17]He's still alive.
[126:10.20]Four out of eight.
[126:11.00]There's four more.
[126:12.00]I need health.
[126:12.76]Yeah, they're on the other side.
[126:15.84]I'm gonna die.
[126:17.26]Oh, dear.
[126:20.22]Ugh.
[126:31.03]I'm having to try so hard right now.
[126:33.19]Yeah, this is hard.
[126:37.15]I should have healed myself.
[126:38.27]I shouldn't have given it to you.
[126:40.13]I should have taken it.
[126:40.77]I should have ate the fucking cupcake.
[126:42.93]All right, we need to make our way over there.
[126:48.11]Yep.
[126:49.17]There's the assassin right here.
[126:50.45]The problem is I just don't know where the ammo is.
[126:51.97]I haven't played this.
[126:53.17]This is like only the second or third time I've ever played this.
[126:55.07]There was ammo on this side, the top floor.
[126:58.36]Alright, who wants to make the trip?
[126:59.42]We're making the trip.
[127:00.02]This is bad to be split up like this.
[127:02.14]Oh, come on.
[127:04.28]Where are you?
[127:04.64]Don't kill me.
[127:05.47]Please, nobody snipe me.
[127:06.75]Don't pick me off.
[127:07.69]You're on the wrong side.
[127:08.85]What are you talking about?
[127:11.27]Well, I mean, like, from the ammo.
[127:13.93]The ammo is on this side.
[127:14.95]I'm at the barrels.
[127:16.67]Although, it's in here.
[127:19.51]Oh, yeah.
[127:20.89]All kinds of shit in here.
[127:21.97]There's ammo in here as well.
[127:35.24]You don't have any ammo, but... Bolt staff is an awful lot like just being a character in Dragon Ball Z. I don't want to accidentally shoot the tank.
[127:51.25]Oh, you got a lot of people behind you.
[127:53.71]Uh, yeah.
[127:54.75]That's accurate.
[127:56.75]Only two more and we win!
[127:58.04]One up top.
[128:00.78]Come with me, we're gonna get the one up top.
[128:02.38]They can get the one up the, uh... We'll go get the one at the very top.
[128:07.44]I followed the wrong you.
[128:08.32]No, this is not in early access.
[128:09.38]Oh, that was not you.
[128:10.76]Oh boy, am I by myself right now?
[128:13.66]It's Alex.
[128:15.12]Why did you pick me by myself?
[128:16.44]Hang on, I'm gonna die.
[128:21.94]This staff isn't really just not good.
[128:27.28]one barrel I gotta go up I'm by the barrel but I'm scared of dying actually how do you get up there I don't know I accidentally I can jump I can throw it down oh watch out watch out there's a machine gunner yeah I'm gonna talk I'm gonna toss this down to you hold on don't do that yet machine gunner I'm in this holy
[128:53.83]Did it just explode on you?
[128:55.75]Oh, I heard a bad spark.
[128:58.78]No!
[128:59.76]I am unreachable.
[129:01.48]I just heard an explosion.
[129:03.14]I am unreachable right now.
[129:05.20]I am on this little... Actually, I might be able to get you.
[129:08.08]I might be able to get you.
[129:09.92]Is he dead?
[129:11.29]We might be able to just look up there and get you.
[129:12.71]No, there's just one rat hitting me right now.
[129:16.71]Good luck.
[129:17.87]DarthButtCrust just subscribed.
[129:20.29]Hey, DarthButtCrust.
[129:22.97]The most powerful Sith Lord in the whole galaxy.
[129:27.11]Yeah, we're falling to pieces right now.
[129:30.21]As long as we get this last one, we'll be fine.
[129:33.01]We just all have to move with it.
[129:37.51]Just gonna give the team moral support.
[129:41.29]You're by yourself at the moment.
[129:44.43]I'm currently trying to not take any hits.
[129:51.16]A hit would mean I die.
[129:54.02]Alright, we're gonna get it.
[129:55.12]We're gonna get it.
[130:00.16]Set free.
[130:00.76]Can I get you?
[130:01.33]I'm gonna try to get you.
[130:04.63]Possibly.
[130:05.55]I'm not that far away.
[130:08.01]I'm gonna get you.
[130:09.69]Please, please, please, please, please do not have a horde come over here.
[130:12.13]Come on, come on, come on.
[130:13.99]It's coming.
[130:15.07]What?
[130:16.07]What happened?
[130:17.36]I'm up.
[130:17.76]I rescued you two times.
[130:19.72]That's weird, but the horde is here on top of us.
[130:21.70]Run.
[130:21.86]Run.
[130:23.62]Just get on the boat.
[130:25.58]Get on the boat.
[130:27.04]I can't... Oh, jeez.
[130:29.16]Drink the potion.
[130:35.70]Get on the boat.
[130:36.70]Jump down.
[130:37.14]Do whatever you can.
[130:38.71]I'm coming, I'm coming.
[130:39.87]Hold on.
[130:41.41]Get on the boat.
[130:42.15]Leave him.
[130:44.37]I'm here.
[130:45.85]Don't leave me.
[130:46.67]Yeah, nice job.
[130:51.23]Special thanks to Darth Buttcrust.
[130:53.33]So you went left, I went right.
[130:56.15]And if you go right, there was just like a walled off wooden planks.
[131:00.78]So I just like got into a dead end, basically.
[131:04.66]Thanks for saving my life, guys.
[131:06.58]Ooh.
[131:07.92]That's a gun that's a... Legendary.
[131:09.38]Come on.
[131:10.66]All face up.
[131:12.68]Shit.
[131:14.98]Come on.
[131:17.86]One more and I would've got a blue.
[131:21.07]It's a staff.
[131:23.33]Hard mode was the right call, yeah.
[131:25.23]It was too tough for poor old me, but... Still good.
[131:30.53]Hey, I got a... Is this a trinket?
[131:32.29]This is my first trinket.
[131:33.22]Is that a good thing?
[131:36.46]Yeah, they have random effects.
[131:38.92]So it can be like, oh, you're just a 20% chance that you... I got 2% move speed.
[131:44.58]Oh.
[131:46.40]Let's go back to the end.
[131:49.27]2% move speed?
[131:49.87]Yeah.
[131:51.15]That doesn't sound like much.
[131:53.05]Maybe... I can just outrun you guys now, so they'll attack you first.
[131:57.95]Was it a green or was it a blue?
[131:59.78]Green.
[132:00.60]I'm assuming it's probably a blue version.
[132:01.98]That's 5%, maybe.
[132:03.22]I don't know.
[132:03.54]Yeah, that would be pretty nice.
[132:04.78]5% would actually be noticeable.
[132:06.24]2% is just... You don't know if it's lag or if you're actually moving faster.
[132:11.00]There is no campaign mode.
[132:12.01]I mean, no... Yeah, but that's what we're doing.
[132:14.53]There's no versus mode.
[132:15.45]There's only a campaign.
[132:19.95]Bastard.
[132:22.85]I feel like they were probably convinced they couldn't do a perfect balanced versus mode, so if you can't, like, get it balanced, then it's better just not to include it.
[132:31.74]Yeah, that's probably true.
[132:34.52]That's true.
[132:41.99]I could probably craft down some shit.
[132:55.62]Actually, I kind of want to play.
[132:56.66]Look at how many people that hits just with a default normal swing.
[133:00.00]That's kind of insane.
[133:01.84]It does, like, no damage, but that is pretty damn cool.
[133:06.49]You can just clear people out with it.
[133:09.39]Craft it!
[133:11.73]All right.
[133:12.27]I'm going to try this staff instead.
[133:13.89]I think it's going to go better.
[133:17.35]I don't even like... I don't even keep... Fucking craft it.
[133:21.03]I don't even care.
[133:23.68]Now the only one I haven't done is Smuggler's Run.
[133:28.94]Have you done that one recently?
[133:31.99]Much earlier, I think.
[133:36.15]One other you would rather play?
[133:40.29]I would rather... Your options are Horn of Magnus, Supply and Demand, or Wizard's Tower again.
[133:49.55]Or Smuggler's Run.
[133:51.13]What's going on here?
[133:54.99]Did it eat it?
[133:55.71]I didn't even get an item.
[133:57.89]I didn't get anything.
[133:58.97]I just wasted... What the fuck was that?
[134:05.21]Okay.
[134:06.31]Well, there goes 50 green gems.
[134:09.18]Just took... Stolen from me.
[134:11.66]Oh, jeez.
[134:13.44]Hold on.
[134:13.72]Did it just not show... Did I have... Did I have this before?
[134:18.82]I don't think I had this before.
[134:20.02]I think it just forgot to show it to me.
[134:21.18]Look through your inventory and see if it says new.
[134:25.78]I don't know.
[134:28.76]I don't think I had this before.
[134:29.76]I think this is new.
[134:30.36]I don't know.
[134:40.45]I'm going to try it, though, because it's really fast.
[134:41.97]Okay.
[135:00.60]10%.
[135:00.80]That's so bad.
[135:02.68]Oh well.
[135:10.47]This is really fast.
[135:14.25]And I can shoot.
[135:14.83]Okay, I'm ready.
[135:17.93]Alright.
[135:19.13]Oops.
[135:21.19]I may have just hit the cancel button.
[135:24.10]Oh, I hate you.
[135:26.44]So hit F2 again, you chump.
[135:35.25]Prepare yourself.
[135:41.82]They don't move through the city proper.
[135:44.74]We're going to steal those things from those fucking bastards.
[135:53.72]And you better know that it's an enchantment.
[136:02.25]Just Alt-F4.
[136:04.23]Maybe eventually here.
[136:06.97]Just delete system 32.
[136:08.75]Just do that.
[136:09.34]Just do it and fucking... Just shit the bed.
[136:13.72]Just reformat your hard drive.
[136:17.06]All right, let's find a bunch of dice We're gonna find all the dice all the grimmer ease all of the homes It's gonna be great.
[136:25.67]I don't know if we're gonna do that
[136:43.56]We're gonna explore every nook and cranny.
[136:45.97]Well, that was odd.
[136:52.95]Happy Valentine's Day, yeah.
[136:54.01]Happy Valentine's Day.
[136:56.05]Happy Earth Day.
[136:59.35]Happy Enchantment Day.
[137:07.40]Hey, how you doing?
[137:07.94]Happy Enchantment Day.
[137:09.20]Hey, I found a thing.
[137:10.84]Give it to me.
[137:11.24]It's mine.
[137:11.90]It's mine.
[137:12.28]Give it to me.
[137:16.59]Yeah, this staff actually one-shots basic rats, which is a big improvement over shooting them six times.
[137:32.25]Dead.
[137:33.53]I hear guards on the other side of this door.
[137:36.09]You do, do you?
[137:38.68]Yep.
[137:39.33]This way.
[137:41.17]There's something wrong with this door.
[137:42.25]Everyone's like standing.
[137:43.21]I don't know.
[137:43.93]I'm scared.
[137:44.31]I don't want to get hit by the patrol.
[137:46.19]We'll get fucking owned.
[137:47.69]Here they come.
[137:49.43]They're in the sewers.
[137:50.25]Oh, boy.
[137:50.59]There's like six of them.
[137:52.25]We should hide.
[137:52.85]And they're coming up behind us, too.
[137:54.78]And they're coming up behind us.
[137:55.66]This is very, very great.
[137:56.92]Hide in here.
[137:57.36]Come over to the right.
[137:59.62]I may have shot them.
[138:00.62]I may have just hit them.
[138:01.54]Why are you shooting them?
[138:02.84]Why are you shooting them?
[138:03.66]I don't know.
[138:04.58]Oh, goodbye.
[138:05.38]We're going to lose this.
[138:06.52]Eat bomb.
[138:10.71]He's gonna hang out in here
[138:21.19]It wasn't me.
[138:23.85]I didn't do it.
[138:26.78]What a dummy.
[138:28.26]You are such a dummy.
[138:29.66]You had to rip it off like a band-aid, okay?
[138:32.12]You just had to get it over with, right?
[138:34.30]You know, what it is is you're lucky.
[138:35.80]What it is is you're lucky that we had two bombs.
[138:39.02]There's a healing trap here.
[138:40.54]We're good.
[138:42.78]Two bombs are gone.
[138:45.28]Yeah, but they were put to good use.
[138:47.58]Maybe.
[138:48.71]Maybe.
[138:54.69]Let me get this guy right in his face.
[138:57.27]I got his friend in the face.
[138:59.63]There we go.
[139:00.11]This is fun.
[139:02.19]Just stab, stab.
[139:16.51]It's a lot of potions over here.
[139:18.59]Is it like a new sword?
[139:19.87]I'm just gonna get like shit-faced on these potions.
[139:23.06]Yeah, what's that one?
[139:23.88]Oh, I don't know.
[139:24.40]It's got chips like blueberries.
[139:25.94]What's this one?
[139:26.88]Alright, let's go.
[139:27.96]Open the floodgates.
[139:40.54]What is this thing on my screen that says left armored enemy?
[139:43.60]Why is it there?
[139:46.10]Is it like a tooltip?
[139:47.94]It's just on the middle of my screen forever.
[139:53.50]Waiting for this giant door to come down.
[140:15.54]When they start crawling down the walls and stuff, they really do remind me of like the Lord of the Rings.
[140:21.16]Orcs crawling around everywhere.
[140:24.60]I think everyone's been waiting on you to say that.
[140:44.87]So by conflagration, like, we just light people on fire for the most part, I guess.
[140:49.66]Seems pretty awesome.
[140:50.90]The fireball one, like, pretty much insta-destroys them.
[140:53.84]This one's more like a dodge.
[140:58.66]What is it called?
[140:59.68]What's that one?
[141:00.60]Conflagration staff, I think?
[141:03.04]Conflagration.
[141:06.67]See, italics can say words wrong, too.
[141:09.53]What is it?
[141:10.29]Isn't it conflagration?
[141:12.19]Maybe.
[141:12.35]Maybe.
[141:14.42]I don't think I've ever said that word out loud.
[141:16.64]Until now.
[141:17.20]Apparently I'm almost dead.
[141:24.12]That seemed like a lot of bullets that I just didn't need to use, but alright, whatever.
[141:28.06]Ooh, a chest!
[141:30.62]What's in it?
[141:33.78]Nothing?
[141:34.26]With absolutely nothing inside.
[141:37.60]I hate when that happens.
[141:38.68]Yeah, it's annoying.
[141:40.14]I'd rather just, like, not have a chest.
[141:56.00]I like just moving around with it fast and swinging this around like crazy and stabbing it.
[141:59.60]It's great.
[142:02.54]And you can shoot the sidearm.
[142:04.76]Medical supplies!
[142:09.04]I found my new favorite item.
[142:11.57]Oh, really?
[142:11.91]Yeah, there's something about it that's fun to use.
[142:23.54]This is a pretty big area.
[142:27.30]Lots of room for activities.
[142:29.06]Yeah, we're going to get some more up here.
[142:36.00]Is there a gatling gunner around here?
[142:38.22]Because it just gave me a tool tip.
[142:41.84]Really?
[142:42.59]Hey, watch out for the gatling gunner.
[142:44.89]Just to let you know in case you find one sometime.
[142:48.22]It just gave me a random tip about the gun.
[142:51.42]That was fun.
[142:53.52]What, just like head exploding?
[142:55.10]No, I just side-armed that guy in the friggin' temple.
[143:09.46]This is where I should raise my shield.
[143:12.72]I barely see your weapon move, elf!
[143:24.63]I can definitely tell the difference between hard mode and normal mode.
[143:27.16]I'll just say that.
[143:27.84]Yeah, like I was saying earlier, can you imagine doing this on anything besides what we're doing right now?
[143:32.97]Like going another step up.
[143:34.73]Another step up.
[143:35.49]I remember playing Expert on Left 4 Dead.
[143:39.28]And you needed the utmost coordination with everybody to be able to do it.
[143:44.44]Yes.
[143:44.98]You had to move as a Spec Ops team.
[143:48.38]There's a bomb on her.
[143:49.08]She should get it.
[143:53.93]I will come get it.
[143:55.15]It's a bomb.
[143:55.85]They're extremely useful.
[144:00.21]Toast to the Emperor.
[144:07.20]Who?
[144:07.96]Who indeed is the Emperor?
[144:09.06]Uh, Warhammer guy.
[144:11.36]He's a Warhammer guy.
[144:12.38]That's all I know.
[144:15.86]Oh, pack guy, pack guy, pack guy.
[144:22.58]Oh, I'm just throwing a grenade at him.
[144:24.59]Fuck this guy.
[144:25.27]Where?
[144:28.69]Like down there?
[144:31.17]Give me the loot!
[144:32.13]I want the dice!
[144:34.47]We got it.
[144:34.79]I guess I wasn't supposed to jump from where I just jumped.
[144:39.51]We got two more dice.
[144:41.29]Two more die.
[144:43.20]So we've got two dice already?
[144:45.54]Yep.
[144:50.40]Help him.
[144:52.58]He's kind of far away.
[144:54.14]Oh boy, he's in... I'm in deep shit now too.
[144:59.68]Yep, me too.
[145:15.77]This might be a tough second floor gate.
[145:19.59]Yeah, this is going to be hard.
[145:22.18]But, you know what?
[145:23.20]You could always just be crawling around on your knees and sliding around.
[145:27.36]You could do that.
[145:28.02]You could just make sure you're looking for your contact and find it.
[145:32.46]Let's just corner creep.
[145:35.49]We have to corner creep here, otherwise we're screwed.
[145:38.75]They're going to be dropping from here.
[145:41.35]I'm dead in one hit, by the way.
[145:43.84]I am dead in about two.
[145:49.20]Oh, deez.
[145:49.62]I'm good.
[145:58.82]Get out of it alive.
[145:59.99]It's just this one guy.
[146:01.25]Oh, my God.
[146:02.95]He got me.
[146:03.53]He got me.
[146:04.03]Holy shit.
[146:04.97]He got me.
[146:06.75]Now, three of us are down over here.
[146:09.27]You got it.
[146:09.77]You got it.
[146:10.89]Okay.
[146:11.19]Two more.
[146:11.83]Block.
[146:12.35]Block.
[146:13.25]Alright, one more.
[146:13.97]I just got decapitated.
[146:17.77]That guy just did a full swing and hit me.
[146:19.33]Holy shit.
[146:19.67]I'm trying to hit him in the head, but he's moving around too much.
[146:36.80]We live another day.
[146:39.46]And we're all bleeding out at the same time.
[146:41.30]Yeah, we are.
[146:43.42]So, good luck.
[146:47.71]One hit from one rat is about to put me back down.
[146:51.17]Yep.
[146:54.63]Like, I'm about to bleed out just following these guys around.
[146:57.73]Just run, run.
[146:59.17]That guy's really far ahead.
[147:05.12]Anything?
[147:05.62]Any potion?
[147:06.62]Get the fuck away from me!
[147:08.94]I just got grabbed.
[147:11.36]I used my spell and it took me above the threshold.
[147:16.18]There's too many!
[147:17.58]We're never going to win.
[147:27.11]Just keep moving.
[147:28.93]Is this a dead end?
[147:34.21]No.
[147:39.61]I'm about to bleed out!
[147:40.47]Gotcha, I gotcha.
[147:41.07]I'm about to bleed out.
[147:42.23]I'm bleedin'.
[147:46.61]I'm not gonna make it very much longer.
[147:48.23]Oh, this was a dead end.
[147:50.09]Oh, jeez.
[147:51.95]I'm just getting so turned around.
[147:52.89]I think we have to actually go in here.
[147:54.77]Yeah.
[147:55.41]I think we have to go into this pit where they're all spewing from.
[148:00.32]Probably.
[148:00.80]I'm dead, apparently.
[148:09.45]No, no, I am done, done.
[148:11.07]Dead, dead, dead, dead.
[148:11.77]You're going to have to go find me.
[148:13.35]I think it's the same thing with Left 4 Dead.
[148:15.48]If you go down like three times in a certain amount of period... Yeah, that makes sense.
[148:23.06]Well, good luck.
[148:26.35]Yeah, about that.
[148:30.76]There's a gatling gun guy just chillin' in here, but we're hitting him with melee fleets.
[148:34.67]There were two.
[148:35.43]There were two gatling gunner guys in there.
[148:36.89]There were two?
[148:37.65]Yeah.
[148:38.03]Lookit.
[148:38.27]Well, give all credit to the teammates, cause I... Oh, jeez.
[148:40.79]I have nothing to do with it.
[148:41.63]Is there any potions in there or anything?
[148:45.52]No food in there?
[148:47.78]I'll get up that ladder.
[148:49.50]Woo!
[148:51.70]Coming!
[148:52.48]Oh, do you see where I am?
[148:53.32]I'm in there.
[148:53.97]I'm lying down.
[148:57.53]Oh, wait, we won!
[148:58.25]That's it!
[148:59.15]We did it!
[148:59.73]Should we just get in?
[149:00.77]Yeah, just get in.
[149:01.57]Forget about me.
[149:02.83]I died for a good cause.
[149:03.53]I'm sorry, Jerma!
[149:05.29]We didn't want to leave you, but we had to.
[149:09.22]It's okay.
[149:09.96]Oh, yeah.
[149:12.52]That's good.
[149:14.28]We get less experience.
[149:15.34]You don't lose anything.
[149:17.08]You get two extra die.
[149:18.44]It's okay.
[149:21.57]You get bonus points for going with everyone, I guess?
[149:24.21]Yeah.
[149:25.39]You get more experience.
[149:30.18]Alright, time to roll.
[149:31.60]There's a legendary at the top.
[149:39.81]What's it gonna be?
[149:41.61]I need to roll all things up.
[149:49.12]It's actually the first time I think I've seen a mace.
[149:53.22]It's for the Empire.
[149:56.52]I got a green axe for the dwarf.
[150:08.73]This guy was fucking carrying hard.
[150:10.73]Yeah, I was about to say the exact same thing.
[150:14.03]Hard carrying.
[150:17.43]He is indeed the bestest.
[150:18.15]Good work, dude.
[150:19.19]Good work, guy that won us the game.
[150:21.85]He's very humble, too.
[150:22.93]I wanna look at that mace.
[150:37.86]What was it for?
[150:38.32]The Empire Soldier?
[150:39.00]I don't think I can, uh... There it is.
[150:46.65]So, like, around how many missions do you need to do before you start, like, crafting stuff?
[150:52.73]Once you get a handful of, um, greens, you can start to break them down and make things.
[150:59.49]Man, the... The one-hander is cool, but...
[151:04.29]Do you have the crossbow for the Witch Hunter?
[151:09.19]I'm assuming, yes.
[151:10.91]I've been crafting down 90% of the things I get to try to make something for a character I like to play.
[151:15.56]Oh, really?
[151:17.04]Well, I mean, don't you like the Witch Hunter?
[151:19.34]I do like the Witch Hunter, but I also like Empire Soldier.
[151:21.88]I like Witch Hunter, Dwarf, and Empire Soldier.
[151:28.13]Waywatcher's fun, but I don't know.
[151:32.61]I like playing big two-hander or big, you know, fast super dude.
[151:38.67]But I suggest buying the complete edition instead of the normal.
[151:41.21]What's in the complete edition?
[151:44.86]Are you sure that's not, like, a soundtrack?
[151:48.44]I'm, like, being completely honest.
[151:49.64]Like, I think that might just be... I don't know.
[151:53.80]I just bought the normal version, I thought.
[151:56.20]This is the...
[152:03.04]I like these because... Now how does that make any sense, right?
[152:08.16]So this is a big two-handed mace.
[152:11.37]And it hits way less targets.
[152:13.75]This hits so many people with a little one-hander.
[152:16.27]Really?
[152:20.17]I guess they kind of reverse, right?
[152:21.97]So the big two-hander, the charge attack hits a million people.
[152:26.13]But its normal attack hits like one person.
[152:29.52]But the one-hander hits way more people on a standard attack, but doesn't hit barely anybody with a charged attack, but does more damage.
[152:37.88]And I'll give it a try.
[152:38.50]I'm gonna try it.
[152:43.42]Uh, we already have an Empire Soldier.
[152:47.06]I think I'm gonna try a two-handed Dwarf.
[153:06.62]I'll keep that for now.
[153:09.20]I'm scared to crack anything.
[153:10.18]Yeah, the charge attack most of the time.
[153:11.32]That's what I was doing when I was playing with it.
[153:12.98]Mostly just sweeping side to side.
[153:20.52]Yeah, you kind of do just bop people with the big two-hander.
[153:26.37]Oh, I can.
[153:26.81]I can change to the Empire Soldier.
[153:30.17]So here's the new mace.
[153:39.31]It's got an odd animation set.
[153:41.53]Looks like it's left and right.
[153:44.24]Up, down.
[153:44.76]No, down, up.
[153:46.38]What's the charge?
[153:47.34]Charge is just straight up and down.
[153:48.48]Alright, I'll do one more.
[153:53.98]Let's do one more.
[153:56.00]Okie dokie.
[153:56.80]Let's do one more.
[153:58.56]I have unlocked new missions.
[154:00.51]Let's do one of the ones you've unlocked.
[154:02.83]We can do... Garden of Moor.
[154:06.53]Man the ramparts, engines of war, or wheat and chaff?
[154:12.03]Wheat.
[154:13.11]That's one where you grab bags and bring them.
[154:15.99]It's a short one.
[154:16.69]Do that one.
[154:17.05]We'll do that one.
[154:17.57]That one's short.
[154:19.23]This one only has three.
[154:26.44]Oh, god.
[154:29.20]Are you sure?
[154:29.90]Are you sure?
[154:34.55]Aw, yeah, baby.
[154:36.71]Let's get our asses kicked.
[154:38.31]Let's get our asses kicked to end the stream.
[154:40.19]That sounds like fun.
[154:43.19]Stick together, please.
[154:45.25]I do what I can, mom.
[154:49.99]Die, will ya?
[154:50.85]Die, will ya?
[154:51.23]That's one of my favorite lines.
[154:52.23]Die, will ya?
[154:53.31]Die.
[154:53.65]Die, will ya?
[155:06.08]Alright, let's make it a good one.
[155:11.76]The end times.
[155:12.88]What are the odds of them making another game in this vein, but for like 40k?
[155:16.60]Probably very close to zero.
[155:33.70]What are their, like, future plans?
[155:35.88]Was this game successful?
[155:37.64]I mean, it's... Isn't this by the same... Like, sales-wise?
[155:39.98]Isn't this by the... Were the Vikings guys... Didn't they make this game?
[155:44.12]I feel like they just do different games every time they make a game.
[155:48.11]I feel like people, like, hire them out to do games.
[155:50.57]Yeah.
[155:50.99]I mean, Fat Shark has made... Devs for hire.
[155:53.85]Did they do Mountain Blade?
[155:55.75]I know they did some...
[156:00.50]ARPGs.
[156:01.50]Like one or two ARPGs.
[156:02.80]Yeah, they've done... Crater?
[156:04.68]Crater was one of them?
[156:07.10]I know they did War of the Vikings.
[156:09.12]Or they published War of the Vikings?
[156:10.66]Or was that Paradox?
[156:11.58]I don't even know.
[156:12.28]It's politics.
[156:13.00]Gaming politics.
[156:13.84]Who knows?
[156:14.04]I think Paradox published War of the Vikings.
[156:19.24]Well, I guess my point is they don't... They haven't like... They don't like stick with one particular series, I don't think.
[156:25.46]They kind of just make whatever games they feel like making, I think.
[156:30.42]Maybe they didn't?
[156:31.64]War of the Roses?
[156:35.48]Um, you know, I feel like I should know the answer to these questions.
[156:38.24]You should know the answer.
[156:39.06]You're italics like the gamer knowledge guy.
[156:41.08]I'm like the indie person.
[156:43.86]I should know answers.
[156:46.33]Can we kill the horse?
[156:47.03]I don't think so.
[156:50.49]Paradox published Mountain Blade.
[156:55.19]Yeah, but Mountain Blade and War of the Roses are not.
[156:58.61]Same thing.
[157:01.01]no not maybe I'm confusing too mountain blade was published but not it was like it's a different thing like the new mountain blade is not paradox okay but the old one was technically published by them or the roses I don't know it doesn't matter are we going all I think we're going all the way it looks like we are I mean it makes sense to start with the far ones early on
[157:27.25]That would make sense if we move back.
[157:29.37]There's a lot of guys in here though.
[157:30.77]That would make sense.
[157:33.97]So can the sacks also burn?
[157:51.46]Like if they get damaged, I'm just I'm terrified to even attempt to oh boy you are in deep shit by yourself down there Not me.
[157:58.25]Oh, that's right.
[157:58.61]You've not playing that character.
[158:00.65]I am the dwarf Oh, why am I taking damage?
[158:15.40]No, I miss being able to swing the big swing and hit everybody.
[158:18.02]Oh
[158:25.51]Can't even see where is he I got I got the poison he's effectively blocking my Son of a bitch We have all the sacks
[158:50.97]Is there one more?
[158:51.63]We got him?
[158:52.29]Oh crap.
[158:53.31]I'm stuck.
[158:53.85]Hang on.
[158:54.23]What do you mean you're stuck?
[158:55.27]What does that mean?
[158:55.75]What do you mean stuck?
[158:57.41]Oh god, what's happening to you?
[159:00.01]Getting rekt.
[159:00.71]Don't worry, somebody might come save you.
[159:03.65]What happened was... I went into a room to peek and as soon as I turned around... That might be a mistake.
[159:09.67]As soon as I turned around, seven to ten rats just dropped in front of the door frame that I was in.
[159:14.40]And the tank's right next to me.
[159:21.53]Yeah.
[159:24.66]He's just hitting me.
[159:26.40]But I'm trying to get as close as I can to you guys.
[159:28.30]So are you playing as the soldier or the witch?
[159:42.23]Empire Soldier.
[159:45.92]Because I am staying as close to you as possible for when I bleed out again.
[159:50.62]He's dead.
[159:51.66]Hey, we're fine.
[159:52.12]We're fine.
[159:53.04]Come here.
[159:53.44]Where are you?
[159:55.50]Where are you?
[159:57.08]You're so little.
[159:58.02]I was glazing over the screen.
[160:00.49]Oh, short joke.
[160:01.81]Short joke.
[160:02.75]That wasn't a short joke.
[160:03.63]That was a short fact.
[160:04.63]Assassin.
[160:07.85]So where are the sacks?
[160:09.19]Over here.
[160:11.33]Have we already deposited the other ones?
[160:12.87]Yeah, we deposited two.
[160:14.49]Oh.
[160:15.35]Mmm.
[160:16.31]Okay, then.
[160:17.89]What did I know?
[160:19.47]I don't like this weapon.
[160:21.19]I don't like it.
[160:23.34]You decided that you don't like it.
[160:24.68]I don't like it.
[160:26.06]Not a fan.
[160:27.84]What is it again?
[160:28.40]It's a one-handed mace that... Apparently... I don't know.
[160:35.51]I don't like the Breach.
[160:37.49]Isn't Jerma short in real life?
[160:38.69]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[160:39.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa.
[160:39.99]Easy.
[160:42.25]5'7", 5'8", is a very average height for an average person.
[160:46.23]I just saved us.
[160:50.85]I will take credit for that.
[160:53.14]I will take credit for the saving of humanity.
[161:02.26]Two sacks.
[161:05.38]I definitely feel like I'm playing above my...
[161:11.42]my grade.
[161:12.86]We're doing fine.
[161:14.36]We're doing fine.
[161:14.94]We only have two more to get after this, and they're right next to the cart.
[161:17.22]As long as we don't get screwed over by a... Don't jinx it.
[161:22.48]As much as I'd like an apple pie.
[161:25.30]As long as an apple pie doesn't fly down and shoot us or something, we'll be fine.
[161:32.24]Get in here.
[161:32.72]Let's close the door.
[161:37.16]Come on up.
[161:37.88]Are you going to come get this one?
[161:40.42]Yeah.
[161:42.01]We just tossed him down.
[161:44.43]Just got to keep him up.
[161:50.19]Actually, I'm going to put it down.
[161:51.95]We're getting some more up here.
[161:55.88]Uh-oh, I got pulled.
[161:59.66]You're okay.
[162:00.18]You're okay.
[162:00.56]We're good.
[162:02.82]All the sacks are right here.
[162:10.06]So much happening right now.
[162:12.36]There really is.
[162:13.88]Really?
[162:14.18]Another one?
[162:14.90]Come on.
[162:15.64]What the hell?
[162:16.26]Is that like a third horde in a row?
[162:19.31]That is like three in a row, yeah.
[162:21.23]This is it.
[162:21.73]We can get these.
[162:22.33]Then we can just get in with the truck.
[162:25.23]We're so close to the coach.
[162:28.19]Just don't get pulled by anything.
[162:29.57]Look at how close we are.
[162:32.50]There's no pole rats.
[162:35.70]No bullshit.
[162:37.98]We'll be fine.
[162:40.02]Just do the... Just be like a wide receiver and dodge around.
[162:44.14]Get Mueller residence.
[162:45.76]We're here.
[162:46.28]And there it is.
[162:48.92]Look at that.
[162:50.65]Four, five, and six.
[162:54.45]Get in.
[162:54.93]Let's close it up.
[162:55.91]Let me just... Let me just blow that guy's brains out.
[163:00.43]Good game.
[163:01.93]Yeah, it wasn't so bad.
[163:06.98]Well, it got really good teamwork.
[163:09.08]It got a cut kind of hairy there for a second There was such good teamwork Everybody was sticking together except for me when I went down and had to get rescued This is when we're gonna get the legendary legendary axe.
[163:23.53]Oh They're gonna be all how I based up how tough is it to get like the extras on this map like the dice and the homes I
[163:34.38]I'm not joking.
[163:35.03]I just got all face down.
[163:36.63]I only got one, so... Bullhead trinket.
[163:41.11]Is there only, like, one face per side?
[163:44.15]Only one?
[163:46.39]While equipped, your health is increased by 30% while knocked down.
[163:52.48]That's... That's pretty good.
[163:54.44]So that means that you'll just stay alive longer when you're knocked down?
[163:59.08]Yeah.
[164:04.63]I just said, yeah, I have no idea.
[164:06.13]That's cool.
[164:12.25]Alright, well, I think, um... What time is it?
[164:14.93]It's probably getting late.
[164:16.43]It's like 2am.
[164:18.21]Oh, it's almost Happy New Year's in Mountain Time.
[164:20.59]Hey, you know what?
[164:21.93]We'll stay up for Mountain Time.
[164:23.59]For Mountain Time Happy New Year.
[164:27.68]Mountain Time.
[164:31.31]This guy's level 37.
[164:32.60]This guy's played this game quite a bit.
[164:34.54]This guy's level 63!
[164:37.58]This dude's level 63.
[164:39.36]Damn, you're a pro, man.
[164:40.46]This guy is a pro.
[164:42.70]He's probably, like, really complaining about us when we can't hear him.
[164:48.04]I wonder if he thinks we just suck.
[164:51.51]He's like, oh my god, these idiots don't even know how to do the real strategies.
[164:54.91]Fuck these two.
[164:56.01]Oh, he didn't even 360 no-scope that guy.
[164:59.85]Can I like inspect him?
[165:01.33]I want to see what he has.
[165:02.09]He probably has cool stuff.
[165:03.33]That would be cool.
[165:04.95]What's that on his belt?
[165:05.61]I want to see it.
[165:07.76]Are those onions?
[165:08.50]Are those onions?
[165:10.32]He's got like garlic.
[165:11.40]It's a fucking anti-vampire.
[165:12.92]He's got like a bunch of cloves of garlic on him.
[165:16.58]When I crouch, I feel like a baby.
[165:20.20]Hold on.
[165:20.40]I want to see his garlic belt.
[165:21.60]Look at that.
[165:21.96]Look at that garlic.
[165:24.60]She's got it too.
[165:25.09]Look.
[165:25.21]She's got garlic too.
[165:26.77]Nice.
[165:26.87]Nice.
[165:29.00]What about you?
[165:32.15]You don't have any garlic, you suck.
[165:36.87]Alright, well thanks.
[165:38.99]What does this look like?
[165:39.77]What does it all look like?
[165:46.46]When I crouch dodge like this?
[165:50.68]You kind of just jump backwards.
[165:54.06]I'm crouching though.
[165:54.80]I should be really little.
[165:56.04]I don't think you have a crouch.
[165:59.16]I'm crouching right now.
[166:00.33]Your crouch is you kind of just peering over and looking at a situation.
[166:04.29]Now I'm crouching.
[166:04.99]Now I'm not.
[166:05.55]Now I'm crouching.
[166:06.15]Your crouch is just you hunching your face forward a tiny bit.
[166:09.40]I'm like taking this tactical position.
[166:15.34]I gotta make sure that I stay as low as I can.
[166:19.09]You're peering around a corner.
[166:21.57]You're hiding from somebody and looking like, oh, can you see me?
[166:24.80]What is the Shrine of Solace?
[166:26.24]I just unlocked it.
[166:28.29]Oh, this is a case when you go to here.
[166:31.87]When you salvage items, whatever rarity they are.
[166:34.86]Yeah, you get the little stones.
[166:37.36]And then you can take those stones and you can craft a random item for whatever melee slot character you want.
[166:45.08]You put the trinket in here.
[166:46.46]It looks like you can choose ranged or melee.
[166:48.53]You can.
[166:49.03]Or you can save a little bit and pick a random.
[166:53.57]So it'll be ranged or melee.
[166:54.75]Okay.
[166:56.61]But it's cheaper.
[166:57.63]It is cheaper, but you don't know what you're gonna get.
[166:59.53]So if you specifically want a sword, and you do the random, and you get a bow or something, you're gonna be like, oh shit, I should've just waited.
[167:08.44]That's pretty cool.
[167:11.28]Yeah, I mean, guys, we're talking about... Thanks for joining me.
[167:14.76]Thanks for joining me and, you know, us.
[167:16.26]Me and it's Alex.
[167:16.84]Alex came by and he's hung out for our entire year of 2016.
[167:22.38]Entire, entire year of 2016 stream.
[167:26.61]I haven't turned off my stream the entire year.
[167:30.75]This is 365 days of streaming.
[167:34.03]Full 100% have not turned off my stream all year.
[167:38.97]Everyone wants to talk about how I don't stream.
[167:44.50]This is the longest stream of 2016.
[167:46.54]I don't know about that.
[167:49.92]No, it is.
[167:50.56]This is the longest currently running stream of 2016.
[167:53.11]No, it's not.
[167:55.39]It's tied for first.
[167:56.59]How do you know that?
[167:58.57]Because you physically couldn't have been streaming longer.
[168:02.68]Well, what if a bunch of other people that were streaming were streaming at midnight exactly?
[168:08.08]Yeah, but you're tied for first.
[168:11.90]Yeah, you're right.
[168:13.20]I am tied for first right now.
[168:17.59]So, therefore, you're just having a world record.
[168:22.31]Yeah, I did say that.
[168:23.53]Before I end the stream, let's break this down for just a second.
[168:28.41]So, that was like... I was talking a lot about Overwatch and streaming Overwatch a lot.
[168:36.46]And then they decided to pull the plug on it.
[168:40.17]And I was like, oh, well, I can't play Overwatch anymore.
[168:44.68]I need a game to stream.
[168:45.78]And I didn't have a game to stream.
[168:48.12]And then the holidays happened.
[168:49.80]So there you go.
[168:51.74]I agree.
[168:53.38]But I'm back now.
[168:55.76]I'm ready to go.
[168:56.52]My dog is fine.
[168:57.56]I'm fucking ready to go, guys.
[168:59.45]I got a video going up probably tomorrow or the next day.
[169:01.77]I'm fucking ready to go.
[169:02.81]You don't think I'm ready to go?
[169:04.75]Oh, it's Happy New Year Mountain Time now.
[169:06.97]Is it?
[169:07.17]No, no, it's not.
[169:08.55]Yeah, it is.
[169:09.03]Yes, it is.
[169:09.93]Happy New Year, mountain guys.
[169:11.47]Happy New Year, you guys in the mountains.
[169:15.74]Everybody in a mountain.
[169:19.22]All you guys that live in the mountains.
[169:22.36]Happy New Year, right?
[169:24.81]At least I caught a good real countdown here.
[169:29.09]You got three for four.
[169:35.56]Time to redecorate.
[169:36.54]Happy New Year, Mountain Guys.
[169:38.54]Happy New Year to all East Coast, West Coast, United States, Europe, Asia, wherever you are, Australia, Antarctica, Africa, Uruguay.
[169:52.39]Did I forget a continent?
[169:54.63]I wasn't listening.
[169:58.43]I just know you didn't say Uruguay.
[170:01.38]Well, I did not.
[170:02.28]You're right.
[170:03.74]Or the Congo.
[170:05.50]No, I said Africa.
[170:07.58]Yeah, but you didn't say the Congo.
[170:09.08]Yeah, but that's a specific place in.
[170:12.32]Right, I mean... You gotta say, like, the Netherlands.
[170:17.03]Yeah, West Coast is in an hour, I know.
[170:19.33]That's true.
[170:20.01]That is true.
[170:21.21]So all you West Coasters... All you West Coasters, we'll see you soon, right?
[170:26.19]You forgot the Bermuda Triangle?
[170:34.26]Oh, yeah.
[170:35.72]Happy New Year to you, Bermuda.
[170:37.67]Prank, guys.
[170:42.75]I just, like, fell asleep halfway through saying that.
[170:46.79]Happy birthday, Bermuda.
[170:48.25]Hey, happy birthday.
[170:49.19]You just said happy birthday.
[170:50.49]I know.
[170:51.37]You just said happy birthday.
