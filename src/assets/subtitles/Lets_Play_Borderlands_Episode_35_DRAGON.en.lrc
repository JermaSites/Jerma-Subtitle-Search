[01:28.24]There's an orange machine gun here.
[01:34.55]I don't specialize in machine guns, I specialize in SMGs.
[01:38.87]I think that's what it is.
[01:39.61]I'm pretty sure.
[01:41.39]Do I have to make this jump here?
[01:44.29]Yeah, you have to make the jump.
[01:45.59]Whoa!
[01:49.00]It says Hallelujah in red.
[01:50.94]Yeah, what does that mean?
[01:52.02]I'm going to switch it for that regular one.
[02:01.92]It's a hunter shotgun.

[06:09.92]That's not the way to go because you just get stuck on the rocks.
[06:18.75]Did you already make it back to him?
[06:20.21]No.
[06:21.75]I followed you and hit the rocks.
