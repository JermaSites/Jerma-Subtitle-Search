[00:01.22]Hi.
[00:03.66]Welcome, everyone.
[00:04.34]How are you?
[00:06.18]Welcome to another day of playing video games.
[00:11.56]And streaming it.
[00:16.54]A little early today, yeah.
[00:18.94]Well, technically early.
[00:22.76]I did say I wanted to start around 1 or 2.
[00:24.66]And it's like 1.30, 1.40.
[00:27.28]Somewhere in the middle there.
[00:31.36]You just started going to the bathroom.
[00:36.14]Thanks for telling us.
[00:39.20]Hey, speaking of the bathroom.
[00:44.31]I didn't even tell pre-stream chat this because I was waiting.
[00:49.97]I dropped my phone in the toilet.
[00:56.65]When it was very dark.
[00:59.01]At night.
[01:02.10]This was way worse than the April Fool's video.
[01:05.64]And it sucks because I got a new phone.
[01:08.64]But it's fine.
[01:10.20]There's nothing wrong with it.
[01:12.23]Let me explain.
[01:14.29]So, you know when you get up to go to the bathroom in the middle of the night?
[01:18.27]Or if you wake up really early and it's... How many guys have woken up, I have to go pee in the middle of the night?
[01:24.17]Sometimes, right?
[01:27.73]Doesn't happen all the time.
[01:30.30]Sometimes it does.
[01:30.88]Like, you drink like a shitload of water before you go to bed, and you go, oh, wow, I shouldn't have done that.
[01:34.40]I know I'm gonna have to go pee later.
[01:37.53]Anyways, I had to go pee, and it's like, it's pitch black.
[01:42.21]There's no real, there's a little light in my bedroom.
[01:45.95]That's it.
[01:47.91]So, I did what every normal sane human does.
[01:52.10]I grab my phone, and I use the light on the phone to
[01:58.86]to go to the bathroom because I don't want a big bright light in my face.
[02:03.46]Ah, my eyes!
[02:06.28]So, you might be misconstruing what I'm talking about here.
[02:10.81]I'm not talking about the flashlight on the phone.
[02:13.77]I'm talking about the home screen.
[02:18.71]Like, the home screen is bright, is horrible.
[02:21.67]So I'm aiming the home screen, I go into the bathroom, and I'm aiming the home screen into the toilet bowl so I can pee into the toilet.
[02:31.86]So I can see and it's not bright enough where it's gonna hurt me.
[02:37.07]And like most people, I have my home screen to just auto turn off after like 10 seconds of being on.
[02:45.77]So you get to this weird goose chase where you've pulled your home screen down to go to the bathroom.
[02:53.29]And it turns off and it's pitch black again.
[02:55.23]You're like, oh shit, I gotta fight.
[02:56.83]Turn it back on.
[02:58.37]Well, while I was holding it down with the home screen, I remember I'm mid-piss.
[03:05.55]I'm peeing.
[03:06.41]It's mid-piss.
[03:07.15]It's like a 20 to 30 second full piss.
[03:10.29]10 seconds into the full piss.
[03:13.00]I drop it, write it, and I'm pissing on the phone.
[03:14.99]I'm pissing on the phone, and it's in piss water, into the toilet.
[03:18.05]Peeing on it.
[03:19.83]And I can't stop pissing.
[03:21.15]I can't stop it.
[03:23.01]You cannot turn it off.
[03:24.85]So I am just pissing all over my new iPhone.
[03:29.04]And I just... I've reached into the toilet, and I pulled it out.
[03:32.44]And I was like, oh, shit!
[03:33.66]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[03:35.70]But I still have to pee.
[03:36.70]So I'm sitting there holding... I'm peeing into the toilet, so I'm holding this pee phone...
[03:42.23]And I- I don't know what- I didn't know what to do.
[03:43.65]So finally, like, I finish peeing.
[03:48.37]And then I scramble to- I put the phone down on the little- on the sink.
[03:54.04]And I'm like, I was like, I was running around.
[03:56.38]I was like a Scooby Doo chase.
[03:58.18]I didn't know what to do.
[03:59.62]I'm like running from room to room.
[04:00.92]Should I use a towel?
[04:02.00]No, that's disgusting.
[04:02.68]Should I use paper towels?
[04:03.78]Oh, do I put it on ice?
[04:05.06]Do I put it on rice?
[04:06.80]So I just started wiping it down.
[04:08.04]I got paper towels, got it.
[04:08.98]It was dry, right?
[04:09.64]Completely dry.
[04:10.34]Took it out of the case.
[04:11.80]Dry, dry, dry, dry, dry.
[04:13.43]I looked into the inside of the little, the hole where you plug in the lightning thing.
[04:18.47]It's an iPhone.
[04:20.27]And that was dry too.
[04:21.05]And I was fine.
[04:22.64]There's no damage to the phone at all.
[04:24.92]Zero.
[04:26.36]And I mean absolutely zero.
[04:28.64]Yes, I washed it.
[04:30.34]Of course I did.
[04:32.67]So let me just tell you that the new iPhones apparently can be pissed on and dropped in your toilet for at least three to four seconds.
[04:43.85]I am not kidding.
[04:44.67]This is a real fucking story.
[04:46.77]This happened.
[04:48.91]There's nothing wrong with this phone.
[04:51.78]It is perfectly fine.
[04:54.94]Yes, I have pissed on my phone.
[04:57.48]For more than a few seconds.
[05:04.61]They are waterproof.
[05:06.53]No, they're not.
[05:11.63]It works for now.
[05:12.82]No, it works.
[05:14.24]There's nothing wrong with it.
[05:16.43]Guys, I've had water damage on my phones before.
[05:18.75]And you get that weird grey line, the grey spots that just take over and they just sit there forever?
[05:24.15]No.
[05:25.22]This thing is completely fine.
[05:28.26]What does it smell like?
[05:30.72]Guys, I didn't, like, I didn't drop it in the toilet and piss on it and then, like, take it out and dry it and put it in my pocket.
[05:36.72]I washed this phone.
[05:38.16]I scrubbed it.
[05:38.88]I scrubbed it with soap.
[05:40.40]I kinda did scrub it with soap and water.
[05:44.32]like I like washed my hands with my phone in my hands it still works I didn't know that's not a completely accurate
[05:57.70]I like did enough water where I could like on top of the phone with a little bit of soap and like alcohol and I didn't, I'm kidding.
[06:05.63]But I am not kidding when I say that this went, that this went kaplunk underwater and pissed on for at least three to four seconds.
[06:14.36]And there's nothing wrong with it.
[06:15.32]It's fine.
[06:17.98]None of that is embellished and none of it's made up at all.
[06:20.48]That is a 100% true story.
[06:24.16]Show the phone.
[06:27.34]Show the toilet.
[06:30.66]You need to bleach it.
[06:32.78]Alcohol.
[06:34.50]But isopropyl alcohol is not good enough.
[06:37.58]Isopropyl alcohol kills everything.
[06:44.65]Show your microwave.
[06:47.15]Microwave.
[06:48.63]Microwave.
[06:57.88]Piss on it again.
[07:05.18]It's still 1%.
[07:05.72]Yeah, you know, they might be.
[07:08.06]It might be 1% piss somewhere in this phone.
[07:10.00]I don't know.
[07:10.26]It's probably dried up by now.
[07:14.49]Piss in your microwave.
[07:15.59]Alright, we're gonna move on.
[07:16.65]So I had to tell you that story because, you know, you guys liked... Oh, I didn't even tweet this stream out.
[07:20.51]What the... I was playing Hades again tonight.
[07:26.85]I really like it.
[07:27.95]It's really fun.
[07:29.35]And I'm going to see how far I get, see if I can beat it.
[07:36.86]Tweet out the pee story.
[07:40.82]No, I don't tweet.
[07:42.30]I do tweet.
[07:43.60]I tweet, but then I hit go to drafts because I don't care.
[07:46.69]So I tweet to myself.
[07:51.21]Every time I have a tweet that I'm like, you know what?
[07:52.95]Here we go.
[07:53.31]I'm going to make a tweet.
[07:54.73]Save to drafts.
[07:55.56]Yeah, that's a good one.
[07:56.82]I don't care, though.
[07:57.56]Nobody needs to see that.
[08:03.40]Alright.
[08:04.88]Let me prove to you.
[08:06.04]I'm going to read you one of my drafts.
[08:10.42]Uh, and sometimes the tweets that I come up with, I just say it a stream the next day.
[08:15.46]For instance, holy shit, parents, sit your kids in front of Sesame Street.
[08:20.25]Do not let them touch the fucking bath salt kids channels where they narrate over The Sims pretending to talk while eating red, green, and blue foods every day.
[08:32.63]That's a draft from like probably four days ago.
[08:35.94]After that, you can probably determine where these tweets came from.
[08:40.85]If I hear the words Democratic Stronghold one more time, I'm going to eat glass.
[08:44.45]I'm sure you could probably dictate what time period that's from.
[08:53.40]LOL, why is Mortal Kombat 11 turning into 80s movie Smash Brothers?
[08:56.76]That was a good one.
[08:57.54]You've heard me say that.
[09:00.25]Oh, here's a good one.
[09:01.59]A sneeze coming on with a mouthful of food is the yellow traffic light of eating.
[09:05.56]I like that one.
[09:08.54]Didn't send it out, though.
[09:14.25]Ah, here's one.
[09:14.91]Serving sizes always make me laugh.
[09:17.05]About three cookies, twelve chips, etc.
[09:19.81]Why don't they be realistic?
[09:21.55]Eat out of this bag until your stomach hurts.
[09:27.14]Hmm.
[09:27.90]There's more.
[09:38.28]No, those are tweets from me.
[09:40.56]Those are my tweets.
[09:41.80]Those are tweets from me.
[09:46.13]That's pretty good stand-up.
[09:47.29]Yeah, my drafts are just me writing down future jokes that I'm going to make on stream.
[09:55.63]It's just a notepad for me.
[09:59.85]Release the drafts.
[10:02.85]You don't think this is a scenario where I'd be like, let me tell you something about eating when you have a sneeze coming on?
[10:07.78]Let me tell you.
[10:09.68]Every time you have a sneeze coming on and you have a mouthful of food, you gotta make a choice.
[10:13.84]You either eat, eat, eat, eat, eat quick before you sneeze, or you hold on tight and you wait for it to pass and try not to sneeze the food all over yourself.
[10:22.00]It would have been pretty good.
[10:27.38]Sneeze the food out.
[10:28.08]What do you do?
[10:30.05]I'm serious.
[10:30.47]What do you do?
[10:31.15]If you have to sneeze after you take a bite of a sandwich, do you spit the sandwich out?
[10:35.51]Do you sneeze the food out?
[10:36.83]Do you swallow quick before it happens?
[10:39.50]It's tough.
[10:41.58]You hold your nose.
[10:43.74]You hold on.
[10:44.50]You sneeze it out.
[10:45.84]I'll tell you, I usually try to swallow it as fast as I can.
[10:50.66]Well, it depends.
[10:51.68]And just like a yellow traffic light, where are you?
[10:55.24]Have you chewed four or five times?
[10:57.72]Did you just take the bite?
[11:00.14]What happened?
[11:01.87]How far, how close are you to swallowing it?
[11:05.49]That's virily important for you to know.
[11:08.75]I close my eyes.
[11:14.15]You cover your mouth and just like sneeze the food into your hand.
[11:22.69]It sucks.
[11:23.36]It's a horrible scenario.
[11:27.98]Sneeze in your mouth and eat the boogers plus the sandwich.
[11:30.72]Okay, why did I read that?
[11:31.66]Of all the ones that people are saying, why did I read that one?
[11:37.24]You guys are disgusting.
[11:39.81]You guys are disgusting.
[11:40.81]Where do you get it from?
[11:42.81]I just went on, like, a five-minute talk about how I pissed on my phone in the bathroom.
[11:48.75]Where do you guys get this from?
[11:49.83]You're ridiculous.
[11:52.15]You guys need to settle down.
[11:56.15]Alright, let's, uh, we're gonna play Hades.
[11:57.89]I'm into it.
[11:58.37]I love it.
[11:59.49]It's, uh, 92 right now.
[12:00.75]We'll see where it ends up at the end of the stream.
[12:03.91]Let's see.
[12:08.34]We'll see.
[12:11.96]This is a contender for nastiest stream.
[12:13.88]There's no category for nastiest stream.
[12:16.96]Somebody just gave $50.
[12:21.33]ZurichDuh gave 5,000 bits.
[12:23.71]Given a lot of money recently.
[12:26.25]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[12:29.09]50.
[12:29.43]50.
[12:29.45]5-0.
[12:31.09]My favorite streamer playing one of my favorite games.
[12:33.37]I can't watch the whole stream live, but I hope you enjoy yourself.
[12:36.39]I love it.
[12:40.82]80s fucking sucks.
[12:47.00]Look, you need to relax, okay?
[12:50.76]Let me get back in this.
[12:52.26]How many would I have?
[12:52.74]Two?
[12:53.68]Three?
[12:55.68]Should we ban people for their opinions that I don't like?
[12:58.63]I don't like doing that, though.
[13:05.87]Oh, audio.
[13:06.65]Yeah.
[13:07.90]No, I don't like doing that.
[13:08.64]If somebody has an opinion that I think I don't like, what do you want me to say?
[13:12.88]You're no longer allowed to hang out here?
[13:14.96]Get out of here!
[13:17.57]No, I'm going to publicly ridicule me instead.
[13:20.75]I just fucked up the word ridicule.
[13:22.23]Alright, I want money.
[13:27.97]If you don't know what Hades is, it's a roguelike shooter action RPG top-down strategy game.
[13:32.23]Alright, I'm good.
[13:40.76]Remember the deal.
[13:42.60]With the traps.
[13:43.20]Oh, no, no, no.
[13:44.12]I made sure to play over that.
[13:44.88]I want money.
[13:51.37]You just... You just tubered yourself?
[13:54.27]How does one tuber themselves?
[13:59.45]I forget what... I don't... What am I... Oh, yeah.
[14:00.85]I'm doing the ice mode.
[14:01.85]I'm doing ice guy.
[14:02.69]Ice guy.
[14:03.03]Right.
[14:07.25]Come on.
[14:07.53]Get that right.
[14:12.38]was my quote medical appointment oh let's talk about that really quickly okay this would be probably the last time I talk about medical stuff unless something major comes up but here you go here's what has been concluded over various doctors medical professionals medical personnel I have two discs in my spine that are black they're dark and that means that they're degenerating so I have essentially the onset of some disc degeneration and
[14:41.80]It's mild enough where it's manageable.
[14:43.92]It's not a bad thing.
[14:46.48]It's actually good to know.
[14:48.36]And the muscle tissue around my spine is not having a good time.
[14:52.93]On top of that, I also have a hiatal hernia, which may have been causing this kind of chest problems.
[15:00.50]So I, the doctors think I'm getting comboed, essentially, where I might have, it's the couple of discs in my back that are kind of slowly degenerating, and this little hernia that's in my chest, and the muscle tissue and the fiber are kind of fucked up around the spine, so I might have like three different like combo attack on me.
[15:21.22]So what we're going to do is over the next few weeks, I'm going to be getting trigger point injections.
[15:26.86]Which is they go into the painful points of my back and spine area and they try to shut it up.
[15:35.91]So that's step one.
[15:38.45]If that helps, if that really goes away and it really has a huge effect on my physical ability, then I'll be good.
[15:49.17]If it doesn't,
[15:51.70]And let's say my back pain goes away, or it's easier to live with, but my chest problem is still there.
[15:59.98]Then I'm probably going to elect to do a hiatal hernia surgery repair.
[16:05.67]Essentially, I'm going to shotgun blast this and try everything that's possible.
[16:11.27]But there's your kind of definitive things that people have come up with.
[16:15.90]There are two or three, the third disc in that area.
[16:19.06]It's right in that spot where it hurts, too, so.
[16:21.78]Um, I have two shitty discs.
[16:25.14]But they're not shitty enough to cause any... It's like, it's not shitty enough to do surgery on.
[16:30.45]It's not like, oh, wow!
[16:32.17]Look at how horrible these are.
[16:33.41]We're gonna do spine surgery now.
[16:34.93]It's not there.
[16:36.95]So.
[16:38.03]I just kind of have to do pain management to it.
[16:40.02]Because you can't fix it.
[16:41.36]It really never goes away.
[16:43.71]I can just get sort of injections and, you know, the theory was a few months ago, three or four or five months ago, that I would do like an intercostal nerve block just to like shut the pain receptors off because my pain receptors might be going crazy too.
[16:57.76]So, I don't know.
[16:59.98]We're going to go for it.
[17:01.86]That was his last break dance.
[17:03.82]Hey, you don't know that yet.
[17:06.28]You don't know that yet.
[17:09.63]But that's sort of where we are now.
[17:18.11]I appreciate all the... Everyone obviously has been concerned about it.
[17:22.73]I have been too.
[17:24.65]But the good thing is almost every single possible thing that could be very major wrong is not wrong.
[17:33.27]There are a couple of small things that I still need to keep my eye on over the years.
[17:37.51]And one of them is I have a prostate problem, too.
[17:40.65]But that's not causing this problem.
[17:42.55]That's sort of just incidentally.
[17:43.73]It was like, hey, you kind of have like a prostate problem, dude.
[17:47.54]Is that what I do?
[17:49.52]Yeah.
[17:50.60]Oh, let's keep an eye on that.
[17:53.90]But remember I have I have done like I've probably done like I've been to the doctor like 30 times Over the last like six to seven months Realistically right so it's like they're gonna incidentally find it something that's new enemy Not doing enough zirkin off
[18:18.85]Can I even say that?
[18:20.47]Can I even say what I just said?
[18:22.65]Am I... Is this allowed to talk about that?
[18:31.80]It's off.
[18:32.16]Why is it off?
[18:33.36]Oh, shit.
[18:33.88]I can't do it.
[18:39.26]Oh, these guys.
[18:39.68]It's these guys here.
[18:40.36]Here we go.
[18:46.86]Oops.
[18:47.40]Oops.
[18:53.09]Oh, it bounces around.
[18:53.85]Right, right, right, right, right.
[18:58.73]Hi!
[19:01.45]I donated $15.
[19:02.74]I demand a face cam.
[19:04.04]What?
[19:06.32]No, no face cam.
[19:10.20]I don't... Guys, don't... Have you figured... Has anybody figured this out yet?
[19:13.94]I only do face cams when I, like, feel handsome.
[19:19.48]And I go, I look in the mirror and I'm like, oh, I got, ooh, look at this guy today.
[19:25.54]Let's go.
[19:26.60]Face cam.
[19:30.95]You know, most of the time I look in the mirror and it's like, ah.
[19:32.97]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[19:37.15]We don't need to see that today.
[19:40.55]And plus, that's a good excuse because I'm naked.
[19:43.93]I don't have a shirt on.
[19:45.05]I have bare chest right now.
[19:49.41]You should always feel handsome.
[19:51.56]Look, I have confidence.
[19:52.44]I do.
[19:53.64]I think I'm on Hermes.
[20:01.88]Oh, couple... These cats?
[20:06.26]Why are they cats?
[20:17.40]Show your prostate.
[20:19.09]Hey, take a look, guys!
[20:26.58]How could that even... Wait, like an x-ray?
[20:29.14]Like an MRI of my prostate?
[20:30.88]Why would you want to see that?
[20:32.50]Oh, I forgot about my skeleton photo.
[20:35.63]I have to get a copy of that.
[20:37.03]Ooh!
[20:46.92]Attack speed or movement speed?
[20:48.14]Probably attack speed, right?
[20:54.65]I would say 1.
[20:58.15]How much faster is 10%?
[21:04.65]I mean, it's not making the charge faster, though, and that's what I care about, but I can still... It's still cool.
[21:12.30]That's your special, not attack.
[21:15.16]Is it?
[21:15.38]Huh.
[21:20.56]Jerma Sans reveal.
[21:25.32]Another $50 comes in from Zerchda.
[21:29.00]That's $100 in the 30 minutes, the 20 minutes I've been streaming.
[21:34.18]Also, I won some money so I can shout our handsome streamer Jerma's special meal from...
[21:40.35]Maccas.
[21:41.11]Macass.
[21:41.91]McDonald's?
[21:45.36]You won some money.
[21:46.46]Well, I hope you got a lot.
[21:57.69]That's a... Oh, that's a restaurant in Australia?
[22:00.85]Macass?
[22:02.71]Oh, it's not McDonald's?
[22:10.42]It is.
[22:11.16]Oh, I don't know.
[22:14.54]I don't know.
[22:15.02]Alright, you cast... Alright, any effects are more potent.
[22:22.84]I cast right now is the... Isn't this the lightning beam thing?
[22:27.90]You cast fire is longer and inflicts chill.
[22:29.88]Actually, that's probably much better.
[22:31.81]I like this too, though.
[22:36.81]I'm not even going to cast it.
[22:38.05]I haven't even done it.
[22:40.46]McDonald's officially changed its name to Macaz in Australia.
[22:43.92]Why?
[22:45.42]What?
[22:54.41]Macaz?
[23:04.17]The cast is unbelievable, by the way.
[23:11.18]Who's shooting all this?
[23:14.62]Oh, it's these dickheads.
[23:21.54]What?
[23:22.36]Oh, it's because the thing he's shooting is blue.
[23:24.82]It's like blending.
[23:25.66]Wait, what is happening?
[23:28.12]What is the little blue shit shooting from the sides?
[23:29.96]What?
[23:40.68]Oh, that's Poseidon doing that.
[23:42.18]What a dick.
[23:44.72]Hey, JPQ plays.
[23:49.19]Thanks for the five community subs.
[23:53.23]You deal more damage when slamming foes into barriers.
[23:57.71]Call pulls in foes in effect.
[23:59.41]Holy shit, that's much better.
[24:00.79]You pull people in?
[24:02.23]Alright, that's really good.
[24:09.79]I don't want to sell anything.
[24:10.43]I want to buy things.
[24:14.82]Poseidon's literally the biggest asshole in all of Olympus.
[24:19.94]I don't know much of the lore.
[24:21.39]Ooh, alright.
[24:26.21]I got 294.
[24:28.05]That's enough for Dionysius.
[24:31.07]Uh, Travis Scott meal and... Hold on, can I get them all?
[24:40.55]Oh, a bunch of you guys weren't here yesterday.
[24:42.17]That's, like, that's just what we call this.
[24:45.42]No, no, that's just what we call this.
[24:47.32]Okay, those of you guys that weren't here yesterday, that's just what we've been calling that.
[24:54.50]That's not like, oh, I'm making, like, a joke today.
[24:56.17]No, this is just what we call that meal.
[25:00.45]Oh, shit, it's, okay, it's, uh, this is a boss fight.
[25:03.19]I need to heal.
[25:05.17]I need, I have to.
[25:05.75]Hit the spot.
[25:08.41]Heal and extra health or heal and Dionysus.
[25:18.29]Maybe I'll do the heart.
[25:20.44]I'll pay for that.
[25:22.22]Yeah.
[25:22.42]Alright, let's kick some ass.
[25:27.52]I remember this fight being very difficult.
[25:36.25]Run is literally over.
[25:37.67]It might be.
[25:38.11]These guys are hard.
[25:39.63]These guys are crazy.
[25:43.03]So, the fiend returns to challenge us again, Asterius.
[25:46.53]Or rather, to besmirch the honor of this competition.
[25:52.92]Besmirch what honor?
[25:54.40]You're just complaining that you lost.
[25:56.12]Even though I was outnumbered.
[25:57.88]Silence, you monster.
[26:01.69]I'll hear no more such wicked lies.
[26:04.23]How was your date last night?
[26:06.17]I went to- I didn't go to- I was at a medical professional's office.
[26:10.21]That's not a date.
[26:11.11]That's the sound it makes?
[26:11.95]One, two, three, ACTION!
[26:12.93]The fuck did you just say?
[26:35.60]Whoa, I forgot.
[26:45.03]He ain't got shit.
[26:56.87]Well, these guys have a lot of health I forgot.
[27:05.78]It's time for Father's Call.
[27:16.49]He's blocking it.
[27:33.40]Oh shit, I stood still.
[27:43.53]What happened?
[27:43.97]Oh, this is when Aphrodite comes in.
[27:52.53]Run into something already.
[27:54.21]Ooh, that hurt.
[27:57.13]Oh, there's Blessing.
[27:57.71]I thought there was an enemy.
[28:06.59]Shit.
[28:06.75]Get in there.
[28:47.81]Where'd he go?
[28:57.13]Oh, there's Kull.
[29:05.83]Oops.
[29:34.34]Oh, there's a call!
[29:42.93]Run into something!
[29:49.45]Alright, let's go.
[29:50.59]Where'd he go?
[30:04.73]Oh, that's a lot longer than I thought it was.
[30:20.40]Charge.
[30:23.96]Oh, he's getting close!
[30:35.71]Run into something, please!
[30:37.83]We're good.
[30:40.53]Good thing I had that father's call.
[30:43.15]It's your uncle.
[30:43.77]It's your... Well, whatever.
[30:51.36]I'm just like every character in Marvel vs. Capcom.
[30:55.54]I'm just doing all kinds of moves, and then when I do my special, I just say the thing that it is.
[30:59.38]A souvenir.
[31:05.19]That's a Marvel vs. Capcom reference.
[31:06.85]That ain't nothing to do with those other four games.
[31:14.57]Oh, go to the fan.
[31:15.27]Yeah.
[31:16.89]Hi.
[31:18.61]Look, here's a fan.
[31:24.88]How come I only have one fan if I've done this twice?
[31:26.56]Don't they know already?
[31:32.36]Does the agreement carry over?
[31:33.42]Yeah, because I haven't paid up yet.
[31:40.36]145.
[31:40.54]Oh, that's right.
[31:41.54]I get full healed from all the fountains now.
[31:43.14]I forgot about that.
[31:44.38]That's not a fan.
[31:49.58]What would you call it?
[31:55.30]Give me it.
[31:55.86]What do I get?
[31:56.68]What do I get?
[32:00.66]Perhaps deal 500% damage to foes.
[32:01.68]Oh.
[32:06.69]Another $50.
[32:09.79]5,000 more bits.
[32:10.85]You guys are crazy.
[32:11.65]Why are you giving me this much money today?
[32:14.12]This is from Ishanji.
[32:15.14]Another $50 bit drop.
[32:18.82]They say, bounty claimed.
[32:20.24]New prostate funds.
[32:23.02]Uh, thank you.
[32:25.83]Thanks.
[32:28.41]Bounty claimed.
[32:31.38]When am I gonna play Demon's Souls?
[32:33.36]Uh, when I get a PS5, maybe.
[32:36.96]Whenever that is.
[32:38.88]Oh, also, I saw the sad news.
[32:41.77]Real sad news, guys.
[32:43.59]Hitman 3 has the complete VR mode, right?
[32:48.03]Oh, that's so cool.
[32:49.27]It's only PSVR.
[32:52.23]And you can only play it on the PS4 version of the game.
[32:57.32]What the hell?
[32:59.62]That's horrible.
[33:06.91]The PS5 version, you can't play it on the PS5 version?
[33:12.62]Why can't you just... Please tell me they're going to put that for, you know, like the Vive and the Index and stuff, right?
[33:19.90]It's such a wasted opportunity.
[33:20.94]POV, your Jerm is phoned.
[33:30.23]There's one thing wrong with this image.
[33:33.86]It is the fact that this person is wearing, uh, like, cocky shorts.
[33:40.28]Do not wear- I don't wear cocky shorts.
[33:46.39]Yeah, but I wasn't even sad about it, though.
[33:54.11]I was just panicking.
[34:01.24]Cocky!
[34:04.33]Whatever.
[34:04.77]I'm not from the part of the world that you're from.
[34:07.05]We talk differently.
[34:11.02]No one says it like that.
[34:21.44]I'm originally from Massachusetts.
[34:24.30]From Boston.
[34:25.28]I'm from Boston!
[34:26.52]I'm from Boston!
[34:28.36]Sorry, that was really loud.
[34:31.89]This is it, man.
[34:34.33]This is... We're here.
[34:35.39]I'm here.
[34:35.81]I'm... Can I do this?
[34:39.01]Am I gonna be able to do this shit?
[34:40.09]Let's go.
[34:40.47]Probably not.
[34:50.42]Alright.
[34:50.66]We gotta save money.
[34:53.50]Because I... I want... Okay.
[34:56.58]What do I want?
[35:00.38]Hmm.
[35:02.98]Definitely the health.
[35:05.24]Let's see what's in here.
[35:11.88]What'd they do?
[35:12.28]I don't even know what they do.
[35:14.78]Holy shit!
[35:15.66]In my pants!
[35:16.52]That's what they do.
[35:28.14]Oh fuck.
[35:31.08]Oh fuck.
[35:31.74]Oh fuck.
[35:32.50]Oh fuck.
[35:40.22]Drink bath water.
[35:41.06]Drink bath water.
[35:41.82]What?
[35:47.64]Just stun lock him.
[35:52.57]Very cool.
[35:53.25]Alright.
[35:53.93]Almost got that HP upgrade.
[35:58.01]Why did I read that?
[35:58.65]I don't know.
[35:58.99]Why did I read anything here?
[35:59.83]Where is it?
[36:08.62]Oh shit, that's shooting blades out of me.
[36:21.53]Out at me.
[36:22.67]Out at me.
[36:23.11]Well, this room sucks.
[36:38.99]Die.
[36:39.85]Die.
[36:42.03]Poison.
[36:42.45]Poison.
[36:43.55]Poison.
[36:54.25]Who's left?
[36:55.17]Oh, shit.
[36:58.30]Oh, my God damn it.
[36:59.20]I'm fucked.
[37:12.08]These saw blades, man, are killing me.
[37:13.50]Alright, good.
[37:18.22]Alright, I'm alright.
[37:19.08]I'm okay.
[37:25.14]Can we see you with your... Nope.
[37:29.44]When is House Flipper?
[37:37.22]Oh, well tomorrow is going to be chat's choice.
[37:40.46]There'll be a handful of things to choose from.
[37:41.89]Maybe it'll be on there.
[37:43.67]I think I'm just going to buy one of these now.
[37:50.58]Alright.
[37:52.32]Should I?
[37:52.74]I don't know what to do.
[38:06.89]I mean, I feel like my weapon's really good.
[38:14.17]I'm just going to do the health.
[38:16.25]Do the health, and then... I'm going to buy that one, too.
[38:19.81]So, what's available?
[38:23.61]Alright.
[38:24.41]I could do another one of these.
[38:26.53]Money, right?
[38:28.50]Uh... Uh...
[38:37.81]I could do them all, but it's dangerous.
[38:50.15]Earn him.
[38:55.01]I'll get a final upgrade to this.
[38:59.47]Oh, dude.
[38:59.93]Jerma reference?
[39:00.59]Shit.
[39:07.25]I can't sell anything.
[39:09.47]Just because there's a rat in a video game doesn't mean it's a Jerma reference.
[39:16.40]Yo, Jerma, dude, I... Rat!
[39:24.84]Yes, it does.
[39:25.54]Well... Wow, I almost got hit.
[39:37.11]Give me those.
[39:37.49]I want these back.
[39:39.51]Stupid.
[39:41.59]Wait.
[39:44.45]No, no.
[39:45.47]There are no boons worth giving up.
[39:49.99]I have a Jerma reference infestation.
[39:56.44]What does that mean?
[39:57.16]I have a Jerma reference infestation.
[40:11.13]Ooh, this is interesting.
[40:15.43]This is interesting.
[40:16.47]This is interesting.
[40:17.17]This is interesting.
[40:22.61]Hold on.
[40:28.38]Whenever you cast damage foes around you and inflict chill, applying 10 stacks of chill causes a blast.
[40:38.42]That's definitely what I want.
[40:42.11]Arctic Blast Gum.
[40:43.15]Alright, and let's get this too.
[40:44.03]I don't think I'm done.
[40:45.21]I want the money.
[40:45.79]3 plus your cast equals hog.
[40:47.13]That's true.
[40:47.37]Maybe I should just go kill him.
[40:48.33]Should I just go for him?
[41:12.96]Is there a way to see how many revives I have left?
[41:17.01]Wait, where is that?
[41:20.47]Do I have two?
[41:23.07]Oh, bottom left.
[41:23.83]Okay, I have one revive left.
[41:25.57]Shit, do I go fight this asshole?
[41:31.70]Or do I try to get enough?
[41:33.94]I mean, I got full health.
[41:37.04]Do I go... I'm gonna fight him.
[41:41.10]Let's go.
[41:43.42]Let's go.
[41:44.14]I might lose a lot of HP.
[41:49.26]I have full health and a revive.
[41:51.68]Gonna play smart.
[41:52.99]Alright.
[41:53.51]Here we go.
[41:53.99]Let's see if I can beat this motherfucker right now.

[41:59.21]I'm gonna go for it.
[42:00.45]Let's go.
[42:00.79]I'm gonna do it.

[42:03.92]Not you be quiet.
[42:04.64]Me be quiet.
[42:15.02]Play smart.
[42:17.22]Don't play smart, not hard.
[42:20.12]Are you winning, son?
[42:22.48]Yes, dad, I am.
[42:24.34]If you want to know.
[42:25.37]Alright, I'm ready.
[42:51.42]Get it started.
[42:52.64]Already fucked it up.
[43:03.48]That hurt.
[43:58.82]Fuck you, Dad.
[44:00.91]Stop, stop.
[44:01.41]What am I doing?
[44:01.87]Don't let... Stop, stop, stop.
[44:05.85]The fucking goblin's taking over.
[44:10.96]Why don't you let your wretches rest in peace?
[45:07.22]Where is he?
[45:35.95]What shall it take for all of this to end?
[45:53.47]Darkness.
[45:59.80]Ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow ow!
[46:08.96]Really?
[46:35.86]Alright, let's go.
[46:36.44]Come on.
[46:36.70]Come on.
[46:36.98]Come on.
[46:37.22]Come on.
[46:37.38]I got a full revive.
[46:38.56]I got to throw.
[46:39.32]I got to.
[46:39.72]I'm not throwing.
[46:40.32]This is the end.
[47:13.39]Oh evil evil Oh
[47:33.42]It's alright, bring me back!
[47:34.36]Bring me back!
[47:58.82]Holy shit, that was insane.
[48:00.34]I'm dead.
[48:01.42]That was fucking insane.
[48:04.17]The whole entire area just exploded!
[48:08.93]Every inch of everything was exploded!
[48:11.65]Ah, second try.
[48:13.85]I didn't do it.
[48:17.22]I had to stand on a pillar?
[48:18.64]Oh, what the fuck?
[48:19.64]The pillars blocked the laser?
[48:22.82]Yeah, but the whole area was poison.
[48:37.08]All the ground was poison.
[48:38.80]I fucked it up.
[48:39.54]All the ground was poisonous.
[48:41.84]Oh, whatever.
[48:42.18]That's attempt number two.
[48:44.46]I'm gonna kill this motherfucker on the third try.
[48:45.96]Fuck.
[48:48.92]That was intense.
[48:49.54]I see that must have not gone well.
[49:07.48]Oh, I have to unlock the other weapon too.
[49:11.25]Should I unlock the fourth weapon yet?
[49:14.73]I need the spear.

[53:01.70]Check the bottom.
[53:03.78]200 gemstones for... What?
[53:11.44]That's a lot of gems for just somebody's blood.
[53:16.19]Don't do it.
[53:16.69]It's not worth it.
[53:17.35]No, no, no, no.
[53:18.33]Don't, don't, don't, don't, don't.
[53:19.21]Don't do this.
[53:21.27]But that's a lot of gems.
[53:30.46]Actually, I don't even know what these things are for, so let's do that.
[53:32.72]Let's figure out what the blood is for first.
[53:36.50]We upgraded the mirror, right?
[53:37.80]Don't listen to the Reddit chat.
[53:39.56]Well, they're a Twitch chat.
[53:40.88]If it was a Reddit chat, I'd be streaming on Reddit, wouldn't I?
[53:44.27]The mirror's grown in power.
[53:45.45]Thank you, Nyx.
[53:58.70]Okay, hold on.
[54:00.30]I got a lot of these.
[54:03.54]Boiling blood.
[54:04.18]Deal bonus attack and special damage to foes with that in them.
[54:07.23]And this is raise your supply if I can do more casts.
[54:09.75]I think I want that.
[54:13.07]Check the left.
[54:20.46]You can switch every trait on the mirror now.
[54:23.02]Wait, I don't understand.
[54:25.18]Press A to activate Fiery Presence instead of Shadow Presence.
[54:30.40]Uh, what the fuck?
[54:35.23]So, alright.
[54:36.37]So, deal bonus attack and special damage when striking undamaged foes versus people from behind.
[54:42.13]Huh.
[54:45.71]This is, uh, restore some of your health when you collect that.
[54:48.92]30% of the amount of the, uh, dark power you collect versus... Hmm.
[54:54.32]That one, I think this one's better.
[54:59.58]Restore 50% of your health of when you don't, wait a minute, what's this one turn into?
[55:07.08]Restore 30% instead of dying when your life total is depleted one time per chamber.
[55:15.99]So you get to die just once total versus once per chamber.
[55:23.35]That doesn't sound very good.
[55:26.61]50% damage and dodge chance for two seconds when you dash right before getting hit.
[55:31.44]Versus... You can... No.
[55:36.56]This one is... You do bonus damage to people that have the diamond in them.
[55:42.50]And this is reduce movement speed and damage of foes with the diamond in them.
[55:47.21]I like this one better.
[55:47.81]This is raising the supply of casts versus regenerate your cast rather than pick it up.
[55:57.82]So you don't have to pick it up anymore.
[56:03.16]I kind of like that more.
[56:12.98]Wait a minute.
[56:14.98]So that means I can cast and then four seconds later I can cast again.
[56:22.81]So I can cast every three.
[56:24.57]That's awesome.
[56:25.09]Yeah, I'm going to keep that.
[56:27.50]And then I'll upgrade.
[56:28.46]Let's upgrade this.
[56:35.80]Alright, 30% of all that collected.
[56:37.02]We can keep that on.
[56:40.05]Your dark regeneration was at 0%.
[56:41.21]How come I have a... Reset talents.
[56:49.40]Reclaim any?
[56:50.70]Oh, that's cool.
[56:57.78]That's really cool.
[56:59.58]I can get all my talent points back.
[57:07.93]More dialogue from Skeleton.
[57:10.19]That's not a WoW reference.
[57:11.53]There's talent points in other games.
[57:13.43]You can reset your talent points in like 20 RPGs that are on the market right now.
[57:16.99]Okay.
[57:17.11]Spear.
[57:40.99]The range on this is insane.
[57:45.09]What?
[57:47.83]Hold for a spin attack?
[57:53.55]Skewer and recall?
[57:54.97]Does it go through them again?
[57:57.26]It does.
[58:02.28]Dash strike.
[58:13.39]Cool.
[58:13.65]Alright, well I have to try a run with this.
[58:16.02]Let's put on the money thing.
[58:20.24]Wait, I don't want to just be like a two trinket loser, right?
[58:34.51]This gets ranked up.
[58:35.29]Yeah, put this on.
[58:41.35]Oh, I can dash with the charge?
[58:43.01]Wait, hold on.
[58:48.94]That's pretty awesome.
[58:51.16]That's really awesome.
[58:52.06]Ooh, Trinket Andy.
[58:52.56]Right.
[58:52.98]I don't want to be that today.
[58:53.92]Okay.
[59:12.42]That's a hundred damage.
[59:16.14]Alright, somebody said I can upgrade the weapons.
[59:18.52]How do I do that?
[59:21.00]Have I unlocked the ability to do that yet?
[59:27.72]You can't do that yet.
[59:28.56]Oh.
[59:28.66]Alright, I'm gonna give the spear a try.
[59:33.52]Darkness, give me strength.
[59:42.14]Ares again.
[59:43.64]Is this Doom 2?
[59:46.04]Spoiling Andes.
[60:01.05]Okay.
[60:02.37]I can do Doom.
[60:04.39]Or... Your cast sends a blade rift.
[60:07.95]I did... I... Yeah.
[60:10.81]Didn't I specifically upgrade the cast thing?
[60:15.15]That's pretty cool.
[60:16.77]One.
[60:17.39]Two.
[60:18.15]Three.
[60:20.65]So I... Can I reduce the casting time?
[60:23.21]Because I'll just be Rift Andy.
[60:25.47]Okay.
[60:27.30]Fucking goddammit, I'm sorry.
[60:28.86]Like, you guys were just saying it recently.
[60:35.98]That's insane!
[60:36.86]Okay, good.
[60:39.76]I still have to give him a gift.
[60:41.88]Alright, we're gonna go, we're gonna try doing Rift.
[60:56.01]Spear's pretty good.
[61:11.00]You just did a rift.
[61:12.06]Oh, and I get to heal from this, but it doesn't even matter because I don't have any lower.
[61:15.32]Oh, wait.
[61:15.84]Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos.
[61:19.67]Going in.
[61:28.79]I give chaos a gift.
[61:31.57]Can't.
[61:33.76]You have traveled recently beyond my senses, son of Hades.
[61:43.56]Oh, well, whatever.
[61:44.36]For the next three standard encounters, you face 78% more foes.
[61:49.74]Afterwards, wounds have a 33% chance to be rare or better.
[62:07.67]Okay.
[62:09.13]The next four encounters.
[62:10.77]Get killed foes, toss an inferno bomb at you.
[62:13.58]Afterward, you deal 73% damage striking foes from behind.
[62:16.26]That's insane.
[62:19.64]The next four chambers.
[62:20.90]Chamber reward previews are hidden.
[62:23.34]Afterward, your dash strike deals 41% more damage.
[62:25.51]I mean...
[62:33.97]That's a lot more foes, but there's a third of a chance for them to be rare or better.
[62:42.84]Try it.
[62:44.02]I'm probably just going to get... I'm going to get my ass kicked.
[62:48.08]This one for the health.
[62:49.48]Ah, with a gift.
[62:59.98]Okay.
[63:00.84]What is it going to rift?
[63:02.02]Okay.
[63:17.15]Oh, right.
[63:17.51]That.
[63:18.12]That.
[63:18.40]Cautious.
[63:19.26]That thing just shot at me.
[63:39.31]Stop shooting at me.
[63:42.31]Stop doing that.
[63:43.61]Stop it.
[63:57.59]Backstab, backstab, backstab!
[64:09.85]Actually, this is going on for a long time.
[64:11.37]This is going on for a very long time.
[64:20.51]Nectar!
[64:24.49]Hmm.
[64:25.81]Money.
[64:26.05]Or fame.
[64:28.69]Money or fame.
[64:29.63]Money or fame.
[64:30.29]What was this?
[64:31.09]Money or upgrade.
[64:48.87]Let's go on a mall there.
[64:49.83]Whatever.
[64:56.09]Yes.
[64:57.33]Uh-oh, bad idea.
[64:58.43]Uh-oh.
[64:59.67]What is that?
[65:00.83]Uh-oh.
[65:02.91]I think that's the original Macintosh you screwed up some.
[65:05.47]Tap, tap, tap, tap, tap, tap.
[65:21.57]What do we have here?
[65:23.79]Adventure Time when Finn's dad loses his leg.
[65:28.51]I did not watch enough Adventure Time to know what that is.
[65:30.79]Is that a spoiler?
[65:39.02]Wait, what?
[65:40.22]That's like a major spoiler?
[65:42.28]Did I just ruin Adventure Time?
[65:43.84]I didn't mean to do that.
[65:53.35]Stupid.
[65:58.61]Oh my god.
[66:06.64]Oh, doesn't that just make the devil mad?
[66:13.08]Oh, come on.
[66:13.80]Don't you just want to make the devil mad?
[66:24.52]Oh shit, I'm gonna die.
[66:25.94]Just kill this fucking asshole.
[66:39.16]He's off the screen, I don't know where he is.
[66:41.94]I've been killed in Diablo II by that exact problem like a thousand times.
[66:48.58]You shoot out of this like a sorcerer's orb and all of a sudden you hear And the lightning just comes off screen and kills you Wow
[67:14.39]Okay, settle down.
[67:16.39]Settle down, clown.
[67:21.12]Ooh, it did it.
[67:50.24]Alright, I have one health.
[67:54.04]I think I need to go in here.
[68:07.14]Only 20.
[68:08.42]What?
[68:12.82]I'll take this one.
[68:14.30]Okay, now do I get the pomegranate?
[68:16.02]Do I get the palm pomegranate?
[68:17.76]Or do I get the mystery bag?
[68:30.61]I don't know what this is.
[68:31.43]Okay, your dash causes hangover, right?
[68:34.53]Or, you take less damage while at 4.
[68:36.31]It's 50%.
[68:36.43]15% less damage.
[68:36.89]That's pretty sick, dude.
[68:39.93]Don't you think?
[68:45.21]6k Andy.
[68:45.83]Hyper Omega Lull.
[68:51.65]I'm usually just like 8 to 10k.
[68:57.05]But usually they're like, hey, Kate.
[69:07.37]Cry, cry, cry.
[69:08.57]Feel bad for playing Hades two days in a row.
[69:10.67]Go for Artemis?
[69:11.25]Hmm.
[69:26.81]No, 6K, 10K, 5K, 4K, 12K, 100K, I don't care.
[69:32.05]Brilliant.
[69:34.73]I mean, I would care if there was 100K.
[69:37.25]That would be a huge deal.
[69:40.27]That would be a huge fucking deal.
[69:41.77]So, yeah, of course I would care if there was 100,000 people here.
[69:48.86]Okay.
[69:50.40]So, thankfully, this is going to help me.
[69:55.13]Wait, do I still have that one?
[69:58.25]Do I?
[69:59.43]Wait.
[70:00.72]Oh, get rid of this.
[70:04.04]Oh, I can't get rid of this.
[70:06.82]Go fishing?
[70:07.40]Can I?
[70:09.52]How do you go fishing?
[70:14.45]Looks like it's blinking over here.
[70:15.41]Right?
[70:24.09]Oh, okay.
[70:29.57]Fishing spots are gold sparkles.
[70:30.96]Wasn't that a gold sparkle?
[70:59.19]Thank you!
[71:03.09]Never sub, I never donated.
[71:04.53]I don't care.
[71:10.05]Alright, let's go.
[71:17.28]This is gonna be Poseidon.
[71:21.42]Oh, it's a boss.
[71:23.38]I'll block you again?
[71:24.28]Alright, just be easy.
[71:27.32]Be easy.
[71:27.96]And...
[71:30.67]This is not an ideal build for this situation.
[71:33.34]Though it very well could have been.
[71:35.24]Actually, it is pretty good.
[71:37.06]What am I talking about?
[71:37.78]It's fantastic for this exact scenario.
[71:59.11]That hurt.
[72:34.32]I said stop that.
[72:40.80]I've given a gift to Zeus.
[72:41.61]Yes, I have.
[72:44.23]My brothers, you do not die in vain.
[72:45.81]I can make as many Diablo references as I want today.
[72:48.07]This is great.
[72:48.49]Oh shit.
[72:48.73]Oh shit.
[72:49.33]Which one of these is a good one?
[73:14.81]Lightning strike is pretty good.
[73:17.51]Call makes lightning- wait, do I have a call again?
[73:22.25]Um, shit, I think.
[73:24.85]It's definitely this one.
[73:25.49]It has to be.
[73:28.30]You're attacking with chain lightning.
[73:29.52]I mean, of course it is.
[73:31.08]Thunder and lightning.
[73:40.18]Kind of- I'm not getting- I'm getting a lot of different gods.
[73:46.95]His Xanax kicked in.
[73:48.23]What?
[73:55.51]Survive for 45 seconds.
[74:04.73]That chain lightning seriously is pretty good.
[74:24.84]I thought the purple thing was an enemy.
[74:28.83]That doesn't activate Chain Lightning.
[74:30.15]Oh, no!
[74:31.93]Almost.
[74:40.71]Three, two, one.
[74:42.35]Done.
[74:43.07]You waste my time.
[74:44.83]That's that.
[74:45.93]Nine health.
[74:46.77]Yeah, I am kind of getting my ass kicked a little bit here.
[74:51.18]I don't think I've given a gift to... Chili.
[74:55.68]I have not.
[74:56.18]Here we go.
[75:03.31]Good Lady Demeter, you've shown me warmth and generosity, and I am very grateful for it.
[75:07.70]Please accept this as a small token of my appreciation.
[75:13.21]An offering well suited for the season there, young Zacharias.
[75:17.33]In turn, as you are honorable and obedient, you'll have from me what the mortals have not.
[75:24.67]Freezing lightning slash?
[75:28.57]Frostbitten horn.
[75:31.63]Cool.
[75:32.09]I'll see what that is later.
[75:35.22]I see the noble king of the Olympians has reached you prior to me, Zacharias.
[75:41.02]She seems cold.
[75:42.04]Sort of.
[75:50.21]Holy shit.
[75:51.35]What is that?
[75:53.41]Your cast drops a crystal that fires a beam for five seconds.
[75:57.03]24 to 12 every half second.
[76:02.97]What does that do?
[76:06.41]Your call creates a winter vortex that grows over five seconds, inflicting chill.
[76:12.73]11 damage a second.
[76:14.05]And... Who cares about that one?
[76:17.76]This is a heroic one.
[76:28.16]Slicing shot.
[76:30.98]Wait.
[76:33.80]Slicing shot is the... Is the... The spinner?
[76:38.12]It replaces the spinner that I have.
[76:43.00]with a crystal every 0.2 seconds, but it's super rare.
[76:48.81]The rift is better though.
[76:49.91]It replaces the vortex.
[76:51.13]Oh, that kind of sucks.
[76:56.92]Jesus, it's not rocket science.
[77:04.90]I've got a, I've got a, look at, I've got a legend, I've got a heroic boon here that I'm trying to decide if I want to keep it.
[77:14.44]I'm just deciding.
[77:17.13]I'm not going to write a thesis paper about it.
[77:19.25]Alright, Dementor's Aid.
[77:24.57]I think I want this one.
[77:25.45]I want to keep the Rift.
[77:29.05]Yeah.
[77:30.43]I want to keep the Rift.
[77:33.22]I like it.
[77:33.68]I like it slow.
[77:34.46]It moves.
[77:34.90]I like it.
[77:35.22]I like it.
[77:38.00]So, that's a call.
[77:40.34]I'm probably going to live long enough to care about it anyway.
[77:42.07]Alright, what's this?
[77:43.19]Ooh, restore 100 health.
[77:45.93]After I do this, I forgot this.
[77:46.87]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[77:47.53]We're going to use Dementor's Call.
[77:48.81]Did you call security?
[77:51.01]I'm dead.
[77:53.43]I don't...
[78:08.40]Well, that sucks.
[78:08.94]I already wasted a death.
[78:23.00]I just... I forgot you had to... Whatever.
[78:30.62]Bullshit.
[78:31.24]I'm annoyed by that.
[78:40.65]Reset?
[78:41.11]No.
[78:46.02]This thing does have huge range.
[78:47.54]Why am I getting so close?
[78:48.66]I'm treating it like a sword.
[78:49.72]This thing has enormous range.
[78:57.19]I'm treating it like the sword.
[78:58.67]What's wrong with me?
[79:14.02]Many things.
[79:15.14]Alright, time that guy out for two hours.
[79:25.02]He was right though.
[79:32.07]Time that person out that just said that for three hours.
[79:42.37]They were both right.
[79:43.91]I want you to time that person out for six hours.
[79:54.58]All of them were right.
[79:55.94]I want you to give that guy everything he's ever wanted and hope his life is perfect from here on out.
[80:18.41]That's a flex.
[80:20.11]I didn't know that did that.
[80:22.29]Okay.
[80:22.71]That changes everything.
[80:24.29]That's why I wasn't using it that often.
[80:25.33]Because I was afraid to get hit by projectiles.
[80:40.68]Boon of Jerma.
[80:41.41]I don't even know what I would give.
[80:49.87]Alright, what like element would I be?
[80:52.13]Water, fire, ice, Earth, air, chaos, metal.
[81:00.44]Meat?
[81:02.18]What element?
[81:03.60]Imagine taking a what element are you quiz and you get meat.
[81:14.93]Uh, I feel that's pretty good.
[81:18.37]Ensure a chaos gate will spawn.
[81:22.31]I'm doing that one.
[81:24.29]I bought this game because of you.
[81:32.48]It's great.
[81:32.96]I'm glad you like it.
[81:33.72]It's very good.
[81:34.16]Alright, I think we're gonna... Alright, here comes the fur.
[81:39.93]Here comes Meg.
[81:49.44]Alright, goodbye.
[81:55.36]I refunded this game because of you.
[81:58.30]Odd.
[81:59.68]Odd thing to do.
[82:01.08]Help me.
[82:01.44]Did anyone happen to kill a red spy?
[82:16.28]How often do I say that line?
[82:17.86]I feel like I do it all the time.
[82:19.50]Too close.
[82:57.92]Get me.
[83:01.10]Here she goes.
[83:01.56]Excuse me.
[83:08.61]Alright, I'm gonna do, um... Mother's Mayhem.
[83:12.33]I don't even know what the move is called.
[83:14.15]I'm just gonna call it what I'm gonna call it, so I can have it in my own brain.
[83:16.77]I know what move I'm talking about.
[83:23.15]Alright, let's do Mother's Mayhem.
[83:33.91]Mother's Mayhem is pretty good.
[83:39.07]Ow, right into the trap.
[83:41.99]It just threw me off.
[83:57.79]What?
[84:27.63]Tapped!
[84:28.55]Double tapped!
[84:33.50]The only damage I've taken this entire game in this boss fight has been from the fucking floor trap.
[84:49.64]Almost happened again.
[84:51.18]Nope.
[85:03.27]Screed.
[85:07.51]This game seems a little easy, or are you good?
[85:10.15]Yes.
[85:17.53]I don't know.
[85:18.37]Look, it has four buttons.
[85:19.45]That means I can do okay.
[85:27.67]I've refused to believe he's good.
[85:29.28]I almost beat the last boss of my first try.
[85:31.80]You gotta give me credit sometimes where I deserve it.
[85:42.26]If the game has four buttons, I will do okay.
[85:46.65]It's the games that have WASD, mouse, 10 items, a bag full of stuff, crafting, and a giant quest log that I have to keep track of.
[85:56.25]And, oh, go talk to this guy.
[85:57.83]Look, you're going to go through that.
[85:58.71]It's like a maze.
[85:59.35]You're going to find this guy at the end of that tunnel.
[86:00.88]No.
[86:01.52]Give me four buttons.
[86:02.38]Give me an analog stick.
[86:03.90]And I will smoke that game.
[86:09.12]What's this do?
[86:17.11]Alright, so a lot of these god boons are just to make it so you get their boon first.
[86:27.33]What difficulty am I on?
[86:29.53]I dragged the slider up as far as it could go.
[86:33.83]I don't know.
[86:34.65]It was like easy, medium, hard, insane, psycho, and torture.
[86:39.83]And I think I was somewhere between insane and psycho and torture.
[86:43.33]I think it was closer to torture.
[86:53.09]Really is too bad that this is so good.
[86:56.35]Two more encounters and this ranks up.
[86:57.77]Does that mean I get to come back three times?
[87:00.89]No.
[87:05.79]It's just more life.
[87:08.22]Oh, that's still good though.
[87:15.42]Alright, let's go.
[87:20.34]Give me back my tooth.
[87:29.06]I've been timed out for 3.627 E plus 7 minutes.
[87:33.32]What?
[87:37.12]Why did you just break your iPhone calculator?
[87:45.56]Oh, there it is.
[87:46.02]Let me have it.
[87:55.84]I can fish down here?
[87:58.14]What?
[87:58.34]Oh, come on.
[87:59.28]I couldn't have got a chaos fish?
[88:01.66]That's too bad.
[88:02.16]No fish.
[88:02.40]No fish.
[88:02.62]Well.
[88:26.00]The next three encounters, each time you special, get hit with minus four.
[88:34.84]Afterwards, you gain another... Oh.
[88:39.86]Well, that's exactly what I wanted to do this from.
[88:46.72]Or just a bunch of max health.
[88:48.84]Or... Oh, that's really good too, though.
[88:53.32]That's so good.
[88:57.86]Any money you find is increased by 45% after that happens.
[89:02.62]But this lets me cast two rifts.
[89:09.52]And it's a three second cooldown.
[89:13.80]I'm going with the rifts.
[89:15.12]What was the downside?
[89:17.54]I didn't care.
[89:20.70]Oh, for the next three encounters each time you special.
[89:23.17]I don't even press triangle anyways.
[89:25.41]I never press Y anyways.
[89:26.41]Who cares?
[89:54.30]Great.
[90:00.98]Guys, I'm either doing not very much damage or these guys have a lot of health right now.
[90:04.18]I don't think I'm doing a lot of damage.
[90:05.69]You are late.
[90:09.77]What the hell?
[90:21.01]Not doing a whole lot of damage.
[90:22.03]This is not looking alright.
[90:27.51]Almost finished with these.
[90:34.68]Get out of the fire!
[90:54.52]One, two, three.
[90:57.14]Oh, what am I doing?
[90:59.85]One, two, three.
[91:07.13]One, two, three.
[91:08.71]One, two, three.
[91:09.79]One, two, three.
[91:12.25]Right, that video.
[91:14.17]Where the guy... He goes...
[91:20.91]That's an old one.
[91:25.85]Mmm, I want this.
[91:28.25]Oh my fucking god.
[91:31.13]That's a really good meme.
[91:32.78]It's the guy trying to do the old, like, first man ever voice, right?
[91:37.04]Like the caveman voice.
[91:45.49]I did perfectly.
[91:49.39]Let's go, precious.
[91:53.54]Oh, shoot.
[91:59.74]Oh, shoot.
[92:12.77]Okay.
[92:13.59]Okay.
[92:15.63]Lucky Tooth ranked up.
[92:17.29]Nice.
[92:20.03]and a shop with money in it.
[92:21.75]I mean, with hearts in it.
[92:24.27]Thank you.
[92:26.12]Wait, what else is on there?
[92:31.94]I want that too.
[92:32.52]Oh, well.
[92:49.09]I hate this thing.
[92:50.75]Just queue it up for when they eventually spawn.
[93:13.61]Don't do it.
[93:15.81]Blow it up.
[93:23.34]One, two.
[93:31.58]One, two.
[93:46.27]Hey, that was unfair.
[94:19.60]Come on, can I please?
[94:22.96]They're making me look bad.
[94:23.84]Hello there, Dionysus.
[94:32.93]He's a slippery one.
[94:34.33]Pee-wee Herman voice?
[94:36.89]I gave him a gift, right?
[94:39.69]I did not!
[94:40.51]How have I not given a di- I have not!
[94:46.57]Lord Dionysus, it's been great getting to know you, so please accept this humble offer.
[94:50.65]Play the one, two, three video.
[94:52.91]Hold on.
[94:54.11]I will.
[94:54.49]Alright.
[94:54.77]What is this?
[94:55.13]Is it right here?
[94:57.92]Let's try male human voice.
[95:00.18]Count over three.
[95:01.56]One, two, three.
[95:03.44]Just pitch up your voice.
[95:06.72]One, two, three.
[95:08.59]Let's just add a bit of nasal now.
[95:11.57]One, two, three.
[95:13.57]Now the other thing that would be happening, which would actually increase that quality, is a very heavy skull that seems to pull down into the throat there.
[95:24.69]Now speak.
[95:26.19]One, two, three.
[95:28.21]Now let's make a sound.
[95:29.41]Just let's make a huge R.
[95:35.26]That's one of my favorite videos.
[95:37.88]One, two, three!
[95:42.81]Did a big, really heavy skull.
[95:45.49]Overflowing cup.
[96:03.65]I like this guy the most.
[96:07.92]Dionysus is my favorite god so far.
[96:14.62]Okay.
[96:16.90]Well.
[96:18.54]Okay.
[96:20.60]This one's good.
[96:22.02]But this one's better.
[96:22.76]You're right, huh?
[96:42.80]He re-gifted it back to you.
[96:45.22]Oh, did I- did I give him, like, a bread maker for Christmas?
[96:49.06]And he just doesn't even know how to- he doesn't have the- the- doesn't even want to open it out of the box.
[96:53.42]Doesn't want to take it out.
[96:54.34]Because that's a ton of work.
[97:01.13]I don't want to do this shit, man.
[97:03.01]I'll give this to somebody else.
[97:04.07]I don't think- you know what?
[97:04.79]I don't think a bread maker's ever been opened on Christmas.
[97:07.65]Somebody- it just gets re-wrapped and given to another party.
[97:10.93]Over and over and over again.
[97:24.63]Stab, stab, stab, stab, stab him, stab him, stab him.
[97:29.00]That's a stand-up comedian joke.
[97:31.64]Whatever.
[97:34.64]Look, alright, so... Whatever.
[97:41.49]Whatever.
[97:42.33]Whatever.
[97:56.20]Hmm.
[97:57.68]Oh.
[98:05.12]Oh, I can do two casts in a row because... Right, right, right, right, right, right.
[98:08.78]Because of the thing that I got.
[98:10.44]Right.
[98:10.78]I forgot.
[98:11.28]I forgot.
[98:16.14]Ooh.
[98:16.46]Hey.
[98:23.19]Oh, did I gift?
[98:24.96]Wait, should I do gift two?
[98:28.02]No, you already had a gift.
[98:30.26]What does two gifts do?
[98:31.10]Just one gift, okay.
[98:32.50]What's going on with his eyes?
[98:55.93]That eye is filled with blood.
[98:59.60]You should probably go get that looked at.
[99:01.14]Oops.
[99:08.55]Okay, here we go.
[99:09.33]We need to do two random boons of yours are upgraded to the next rarity right now.
[99:15.29]Four random boons gain a level or the next three boons will have upgraded rarity.
[99:27.67]Probably this one.
[99:29.99]This one or this one.
[99:33.38]Wait, don't I already have the upgraded rarity thing already?
[99:37.36]So would this... That would be even more.
[99:45.75]They might be legendaries.
[99:50.71]That's a big deal.
[99:51.65]They might be like heroics and legendaries.
[100:14.25]That's nice.
[100:14.73]Dude, one time... I don't know why this is reminding me of this, but... The original Punisher movie... Had a song in it.
[100:33.53]That was... Like... You may come back someday...
[100:40.89]live once more die once more that so forget about that part the part that I'm referring to is uh in college I remember in the DVD player that was what played on loop at the menu screen and I remember falling asleep with that in the DVD player the punisher DVD
[101:02.54]And waking up every, I would say... 5 to 10 minutes over the course of like 3 or 4 hours.
[101:09.23]To... You may come back someday.
[101:14.43]Live once more.
[101:15.53]And I just don't care.
[101:16.63]I'm too tired to get up and turn it off.
[101:19.37]It was at least 3 or 4 hours.
[101:20.84]It was just on the cycling the menu song.
[101:31.19]That's fucking funny because I kept waking up to, you may come back someday.
[101:35.43]So I was like, eyes open, you may come back someday.
[101:38.51]Ah, yeah, one day maybe I'm going to sleep.
[101:42.61]You may come back someday.
[101:44.89]I'm coming, I'm back again, but please, I'd like to go to sleep.
[101:49.97]Hmm.
[101:51.48]Go on.
[101:55.08]Why did I keep doing it?
[101:55.92]I don't know, eventually I just like stumbled out of the bed and just like smashed on every button on the DVD player and hoped that it turned it off.
[102:06.15]Oh, actually I think I walked up and just hit- you know what the quickest way to turn a fucking DVD off?
[102:10.39]Was just open the disc tray.
[102:13.17]Just walk up, press open disc tray button, go back to bed.
[102:17.77]But then you have the problem where you just have a blue TV, that sucked too.
[102:23.22]Because now you have a new problem.
[102:24.30]You have this blue burning light that's just always on you.
[102:29.22]So you gotta do open the disk tray, turn the TV power button off, and go back to bed.
[102:36.20]Uh... This is... I kind of want the health.
[102:41.36]I'll take it.
[102:44.23]Damn, that's pretty good.
[102:48.39]After using a call, you deal more damage for 15 seconds.
[102:57.92]Your lightning effects make foes jolted.
[102:59.72]Yeah.
[103:03.06]Jolted really is just so broken.
[103:06.22]This is cool, but this is broken.
[103:13.69]I'm doing the cool one.
[103:14.91]Alright, let's move.
[103:24.70]Oh, here we go.
[103:25.50]I should have taken the health.
[103:26.31]What am I doing?
[103:27.89]It's not broken.
[103:28.49]It's bad.
[103:29.27]That's what I mean.
[103:30.09]It's just broken.
[103:30.89]It sucks so much.
[103:31.55]Why would you even use it?
[103:32.27]It needs to be updated.
[103:33.61]What did you think I was talking about?
[103:34.55]Alright, this one shouldn't be too bad considering I have the Rift.
[103:57.29]Yeah.
[103:58.87]Why?
[103:59.63]I was so complacent.
[104:00.75]Don't give... Alright, quiet.
[104:20.14]Alright, that's good.
[104:20.72]That's good.
[104:21.02]That's good.
[104:21.30]That's good.
[104:21.60]That's good.
[104:21.98]Now we're going to do this.
[104:44.28]Come on, dude.
[104:49.68]What are you doing?
[104:51.48]What am I actually doing?
[104:52.16]I'm getting so close for no reason.
[104:55.26]What the fuck am I doing here?
[105:07.26]There.
[105:08.86]Alright, let's go.
[105:22.74]Into the fire!
[105:24.54]Into the fire!
[105:25.20]Into the fire!
[105:40.49]Stop the fire!
[105:49.49]My favorite god in spite, by the way.
[105:50.98]Best character, coolest moveset.
[105:53.74]He didn't get enough love.
[106:19.12]Go, go, do it!
[106:22.23]We're good.
[106:24.55]Play Smite.
[106:25.35]I played Smite for like 10 minutes, LOL.
[106:31.14]What the fuck is going on today?
[106:34.60]You know, I replaced words with just like laugh, I guess.
[106:37.91]I'm busy playing a game, so I can't really talk that much unless I'm taking a break like this.
[106:43.83]So replace words with just laugh in a weird way.
[106:47.08]That's odd, right?
[106:48.70]I'm like every bad guy in a children's show.
[107:08.46]They say a sentence and then they laugh like that.
[107:10.44]Hi, this is good.
[107:20.57]Oh, this restores 100 health.
[107:25.32]You have to micromanage brain RAM.
[107:29.12]Yeah.
[107:31.50]Guys, I don't know how many of you guys might know this.
[107:33.70]Some of you might be new viewers.
[107:35.76]I have...
[107:37.49]Like 2 gigs of memory.
[107:40.05]But.
[107:41.69]It's incredibly fast.
[107:47.38]It's very fast.
[107:48.66]But there's only 2 gigs.
[107:52.10]It's 2 gigs of like DDR5 6400 MHz RAM.
[108:07.40]There's just not a whole lot of it.
[108:12.10]I don't have any money anyways.
[108:19.88]You have a 24 max FPS brain speed.
[108:24.99]What about your CPU?
[108:26.09]Um, that's... Okay, my CPU...
[108:31.37]My CPU is like a 32 core, 10 gig overclocked CPU.
[108:37.11]But then it runs into my 2 gigahertz, 2 gigabyte RAM.
[108:42.39]It gets stuck.
[108:47.66]My graphics card sucks ass too.
[108:49.16]My eyes are terrible.
[108:53.78]I'm running, I have like a, okay, I have a mobile graphics card up here in my head.
[108:59.18]My vision's not very good.
[109:02.35]And I've missed things.
[109:03.03]I'm really slow, like, visually a lot of the time.
[109:07.52]I have, like, a... Okay.
[109:09.36]I don't even have a G-Force.
[109:10.44]I have old ATI.
[109:12.32]Old AMD.
[109:13.02]See, back in the day, AMD graphics cards were not the cool thing.
[109:15.36]I have, like, an ATI Mobility Radeon 1100 M. I can fish here?
[109:24.04]Where's the fishing spot?
[109:35.89]Oh, come on.
[109:36.59]Just a lore.
[109:37.19]So what's the point of the fishing rod?
[109:39.65]Hammer.
[109:40.07]Always hammer.
[110:18.73]Blow it up.
[110:24.75]Oh my god, those things attack you.
[110:30.12]Good, who's next?
[110:30.94]Bring it on.
[110:39.71]Oopsie.
[110:47.84]Don't let him shoot you.
[110:55.15]Another one?
[111:01.93]Who has the... Who's shooting at me?
[111:04.47]It's not you.
[111:04.93]You don't have your bow out.
[111:07.32]Who the hell is aiming at me?
[111:08.20]It was you.
[111:13.27]Your special becomes a shot that deals 50 base damage in an area.
[111:15.90]Boring.
[111:16.70]Hold special for up to 200% base damage and minimum range reduced.
[111:22.70]Your special deals 50% damage... Wait.
[111:26.82]That's pretty good.
[111:29.58]So the special deals plus 50% damage and plus 50% critical chance on recovery.
[111:37.66]What does on recovery mean?
[111:45.84]On recovery.
[111:50.26]When you call it back, but... Oh, right.
[111:54.43]Okay.
[112:00.31]I don't really use the special that often.
[112:01.77]I really don't.
[112:06.35]Maybe this would be better.
[112:07.11]Hmm.
[112:14.20]200%.
[112:14.22]That's a lot, though.
[112:19.08]I'll try this because it crits, right?
[112:20.68]So when you pull it back... Okay.
[112:23.80]Maybe I'll use it sometimes.
[112:26.76]Eh.
[112:27.20]I'm not happy with any of that.
[112:41.40]Oh!
[112:45.65]I mean, it's good.
[112:47.81]It's good.
[112:48.40]But it's a lot to pay attention to.
[112:56.40]It's good.
[112:57.13]135 damage is a lot.
[112:58.93]I just have to remember to use it.
[113:27.75]Hey, hey!
[113:30.17]Two gigabytes can't load the image.
[113:36.17]No, I just get stuck.
[113:38.52]Oh, more singing.
[113:44.40]This is different.
[113:50.13]This is different.
[113:53.71]Amid Elysium's moss-covered chambers, carved of stone, stand untold numbers of eternal monuments in tribute to the greatest heroes which mortality can offer.
[114:05.62]There to honor them in life as well as death.
[114:10.85]Is this a new character?
[114:11.59]This place is near as gloomy as the house.
[114:16.97]Is this a new character?
[114:21.98]Oh, it's the Bard.
[114:22.92]Hello, Bard.
[114:25.08]My name is the Bard.
[114:40.08]Names are there to be forgotten, stranger.
[114:43.28]You shouldn't be here.
[114:45.14]May the fates favor your journey.
[114:47.70]But just in case they don't... Oh, he's a wicked cool character.
[114:54.65]Oh.
[114:55.41]The shade offers one of several premium goods.
[114:59.69]That's good.
[115:03.37]That's also very good.
[115:06.69]Holy shit, this guy's unbelievable.
[115:10.64]Oh my god!
[115:11.58]Uh... One, but ten encounters.
[115:19.31]How many encounters are left in the game?
[115:20.79]Just... Alright, hold on a minute.
[115:31.70]If there's only a few more rooms left, that means I'll have 60% more damage for the last boss.
[115:48.04]Refill me.
[115:49.26]He's a shield user.
[115:52.26]I want this.
[115:52.70]Excuse me.
[116:18.27]Did I get hit by a trap?
[116:19.03]I did.
[116:19.23]Of course I did.
[116:32.12]Don't you respawn!
[116:33.68]Alright, I gotta drop this somewhere.
[116:46.67]Who's alive?
[116:47.23]You.
[116:47.41]Just... Again.
[116:58.86]Holy fuck.
[117:04.47]Oh my god.
[117:07.19]Bad.
[117:07.49]Very bad.
[117:07.91]Very bad.
[117:08.27]Where are the bows?
[117:10.97]You...
[117:19.93]You asshole with the bow!
[117:42.83]Alright.
[117:45.77]Almost did, actually.
[117:49.44]Delicious.
[117:51.73]Delicious.
[117:52.63]Okay.
[117:56.71]That's really good.
[117:57.81]Number three is unbelievable.
[118:00.57]You're attacking with chain lightning, so it's just better chain lightning, but this is a full almost 10% more damage after hitting right trigger.
[118:10.19]This is extra... Oh, don't... What are you doing?
[118:15.87]I think they're all very good.
[118:21.67]Alright, what is better, just statistically?
[118:27.12]Doing 15 damage every 0.25 seconds, or doing 8% more damage after doing it?
[118:38.75]Probably the third one, right?
[118:52.83]One, if you use it more often.
[118:54.13]Three, please click that link so they stop posting it.
[118:59.47]Uh, I don't know.
[119:05.89]It's... I want to do more all-around damage.
[119:08.90]I'm going for it, whatever.
[119:13.30]Alright, I'll open the link.
[119:22.34]Alright, so this is my boon?
[119:25.36]I didn't get a chance to see it yet.
[119:26.48]Let's see.
[119:35.83]All of your attacks lose 50% damage, but you get a slice of bologna.
[119:41.59]Take it!
[119:42.05]Do it!
[119:42.37]That's worth it!
[119:44.95]That's actually worth it.
[119:51.12]How much does the bologna heal?
[119:59.47]Boomer.
[119:59.95]Oh my god, I almost quit the game.
[120:02.31]Boomer sense of humor.
[120:03.87]What?
[120:04.25]Come on, that's cute.
[120:11.13]Um... I need to... I gotta heal.
[120:15.73]Sorry, Ares.
[120:34.52]Do not hit me.
[120:36.18]Under any gosh darn circumstances.
[120:38.06]You hit me.
[120:38.84]You hit me.
[120:40.63]They hit me.
[120:51.47]Oh, hey, please.
[120:58.19]Okay.
[121:03.58]Oh, no.
[121:04.28]I'm not done.
[121:04.70]Oh, shit.
[121:06.56]Oh, shit.
[121:18.04]Who the fuck?
[121:18.96]Oh, it's this guy with a bow back here.
[121:20.70]You dick.
[121:21.76]Ah, I hate you.
[121:25.90]Of course you guys get to hang out in these, like, traps.
[121:39.86]Oh, my God.
[121:40.16]Why can you shoot across the whole screen?
[121:42.64]Game just went down 1.5.
[121:46.14]Game just went down one point.
[121:47.28]It was a 92.
[121:47.56]Now it's a 91.
[121:58.81]You just went down a whole... You went down one millipoint.
[122:13.19]Spam your cast?
[122:14.11]I'm using it like almost every time.
[122:17.33]Uh, I'm gonna have to do this one.
[122:22.19]This is a 92, but Lego Island isn't.
[122:34.11]I've never played Lego Island.
[122:35.47]I have no idea what Lego Island even is.
[122:37.35]What do I do?
[122:45.44]I'm going to heal 10% for the next few rooms, which is like 15 health.
[122:52.59]I could take the boon or I could take even more HP.
[122:54.77]I could get this and I don't have enough of that, do I?
[123:04.50]I could do both.
[123:07.60]Always boon, always boon, always boon, always boon.
[123:11.97]Yes.
[123:12.13]Oh no.
[123:12.25]Your special is stronger and inflicts chill.
[123:13.61]That's so much more damage.
[123:14.77]But.
[123:43.14]I gotta go long term here.
[123:51.78]I have to go long term?
[124:05.39]That's it.
[124:07.96]One is long term.
[124:08.74]Yeah, but three is longer term.
[124:10.08]Because now I heal from more no matter what.
[124:12.96]From every source.
[124:16.68]And I needed that health.
[124:17.52]Because I'm about to fight the boss.
[124:23.74]One away from the meal.
[124:25.24]Yeah, oh well.
[124:28.88]Three is short term 100%.
[124:30.08]Alright.
[124:34.16]Really?
[124:34.70]I didn't get a chance.
[124:47.25]Don't hit me.
[124:47.67]Come on.
[124:48.39]The little guys are going back.
[124:55.40]Literally have no idea what just happened.
[124:56.38]I think I killed him.
[125:15.42]You just actually hit me.
[125:16.56]No, you didn't.
[125:35.10]There's more?
[125:46.81]Jesus.
[126:02.55]Ow.
[126:15.72]How did you really just bounce off that shit?
[126:17.56]Come on, dude.
[126:20.76]Lost HP already.
[126:22.96]Yeah, these rooms are fucking crazy.
[126:29.95]I'll get it back.
[126:49.47]Do not pick that up.
[126:58.47]Do not pick that up.
[126:59.75]No, I hate this place.
[127:00.89]Okay.
[127:26.51]Kill kill kill More More More
[128:05.28]More?
[128:07.44]I spit.
[128:08.32]I spit everywhere.
[128:10.78]It's everywhere.
[128:11.38]It's so bad.
[128:12.18]It's like I sprayed my mirror in my bathroom with Windex.
[128:15.92]It's insane.
[128:20.38]Hold on.
[128:22.60]This is disgusting.
[128:24.40]It's horrible.
[128:29.21]It's everywhere.
[128:33.45]Oh, no.
[128:35.85]This is not good.
[128:36.49]Gotta fix that.
[128:41.37]It's okay.
[128:41.77]I got it.
[128:42.73]I'm getting it.
[128:50.79]Good thing there's a shop.
[128:52.85]Oh, I missed the... It's okay.
[128:59.40]Show the spit?
[129:00.06]That's gross.
[129:05.95]Boss time.
[129:07.61]It's boss time and I'm not ready.
[129:14.58]I'm in deep shit here.
[129:15.46]I have a gift.
[129:21.24]That's good.
[129:37.68]3 dash is always good.
[129:39.00]16 extra gold per chamber is really good too, but I need this.
[129:50.30]Alright.
[129:58.03]Triple dash.
[129:59.25]I have a revive.
[130:02.51]I don't think this is the one.
[130:03.85]I'm not sure this is the run.
[130:11.55]I can dash five times?
[130:15.17]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[130:16.99]I changed my mind.
[130:17.93]Can I change my mind?
[130:18.73]That's unbelievable.
[130:32.64]That's cool.
[130:33.16]Okay, but I'm not very good with the spear though.
[130:36.36]Whatever, let's go.
[130:42.42]Come on, King.
[130:44.30]Don't give up.
[130:44.72]You got it.
[130:45.72]That's true.
[130:46.06]I have a full revive and I have five dash.
[130:50.57]That just changed everything.
[131:02.57]You got this, King.
[131:03.15]Thanks.
[131:03.47]Go.
[131:03.55]I feel like I'm abusing it.
[131:34.99]Oh my god.
[131:35.89]Okay, pay attention.
[131:45.66]Just play smart.
[132:10.34]Wow!
[132:20.62]What the fuck am I doing standing still?! !
[132:44.13]You think you have the wherewithal to achieve victory?
[133:11.66]God damn it.
[133:12.22]This build is not good.
[133:12.98]I'm not going with the spear.
[133:14.89]I feel like this is taking forever.
[133:42.47]They haven't even called in Athena yet.
[133:45.91]I'm dead.
[134:16.64]You fucking truck!
[134:40.49]This is so long!
[134:43.69]Get him, get him, get him!
[134:59.60]Oh here we go, this is bad.
[135:00.66]Get the fuck away from me!
[135:16.93]Will you walk into this please?
[135:36.02]Ow, that hurt.
[135:38.48]Jesus!
[136:19.90]Oh my goodness!
[136:51.24]I just wasn't doing any damage.
[136:59.02]Spear's not for me.
[137:01.74]Ah, the dreaded Minotaur.
[137:11.65]Shades of the dead mill constantly within the house, complaining of their woes.
[137:19.37]Sounded like Gary when he ate- Sounded like Spongebob when he ate Gary's food.
[137:24.30]Uh, I just don't- I wasn't doing enough damage.
[137:34.98]Oh, you're back.
[137:37.18]Did I give him a gift?
[137:41.74]I needed that special boon that you gave up.
[137:44.48]Yeah, so that's just how the cookie crumbles, isn't it?
[137:48.12]Made one wrong decision.
[137:49.69]I like shield.
[137:52.13]I like bow.
[138:06.60]And if you're so concerned about our court musician, why don't you commute a sentence yourself?
[138:11.87]Seeing as I haven't gotten around to it yet.
[138:14.37]Howard, that's fine.
[138:17.71]I get to live.
[138:18.87]I'll just ask the house contractor since you're too busy.
[138:26.20]Contractor, mind locating the court musician's sentence when you get the chance?
[138:30.46]Actually, I think I have some quests to do, right?
[138:33.60]I'm going to give him a gift because I haven't given him a gift yet.
[138:37.64]hey uh father I thought maybe you know here where would you get this you think you can butter me up with such trifles give me that and then get out of here you're welcome father shall we get back to work what the hell wait well next
[139:05.61]Did I give him another one?
[139:06.71]He needs two?
[139:07.89]Granted what?
[139:09.45]Oh.
[139:12.31]Alright, let's see.
[139:13.15]I got 20.
[139:32.02]Court musician.
[139:33.06]Free Orpheus from solitary confinement.
[139:36.76]Hello?
[139:39.94]I mean, I have another one.
[139:58.80]What do you do?
[139:59.16]Morpheus, Orpheus, Dickus, Smalicious.
[140:00.82]What the hell are you doing?
[140:01.84]I was in all caps, by the way.
[140:27.49]You guys are fucking hilarious.
[140:28.83]Some people don't like the insanity.
[140:30.07]But I love it.
[140:30.63]I love the stream of just insane consciousness.
[140:33.11]Are you 12?
[140:33.77]No, I'm 35.
[140:34.07]If you didn't know.
[141:02.05]Dude, I'm gonna be 36.
[141:04.12]What the fuck?
[141:04.88]That's... I gotta, like, stop wearing suits and, like, pants and ties.
[141:12.06]Once I turn 36, 37, I gotta start wearing, like, clothes.
[141:17.65]I have to start combing my hair all the way from one side to the other.
[141:24.30]Doesn't matter what kind of hair I have.
[141:25.96]I just have to start doing that.
[141:30.95]I grieve for you, my friend.
[141:33.03]But if you've come to ask me for a song, why?
[141:36.03]I'm afraid I must stand firm about my answer.
[141:40.48]I felt that way about 25, then 27, then 30.
[141:42.96]That feeling never goes away.
[141:44.76]I think that feeling turns into acceptance.
[141:49.64]Act broken.
[141:50.30]Shit.
[141:51.22]Can I give a gift?
[141:55.89]I'm here no more for now.
[141:59.27]I think at 40, that just turns into life.
[142:01.53]You know, that's it.
[142:03.21]Like, okay, you're 40 now.
[142:05.13]There's no more like, well, you know, I'm like 30 still.
[142:07.76]I'm like turning 37.
[142:10.40]No, you're 40.
[142:11.18]Oh.
[142:13.32]All of your teachers are 40.
[142:14.90]All of my teachers are 40.
[142:16.56]Like, I'm an old teacher now.
[142:18.82]What do you want from me?
[142:20.22]Leave me alone.
[142:21.36]We have nothing to discuss here anymore.
[142:25.92]Midlife crisis?
[142:26.70]Yeah, at 40.
[142:27.12]I'm gearing up for the midlife crisis in like five years.
[142:29.57]What is this?
[142:29.97]Prophecy fulfilled.
[142:50.80]The lounging area within the house of Hades is a dismal place to be, in spite of its intended purpose to enliven the house's grim inhabitants.
[143:00.51]This is pretty cool.
[143:01.81]It's better than nothing.
[143:02.95]Fresh pomegranates and bread.
[143:05.89]This actually sucks.
[143:08.41]A steady diet of pomegranates, French bread, and fish.
[143:17.52]That's it.
[143:21.41]Uh, I'm not into that.
[143:28.55]Hmm.
[143:29.71]I can still do that.
[143:33.87]I don't think I'm gonna do this, though.
[143:37.05]Where's the mayo?
[143:38.85]No, where's the... Anything but onions, pomegranates, bread, and fish.
[143:49.05]Oh, hi!
[143:52.61]Is there a point where that head gets attached to something and then all of a sudden she gets powers and can control stuff again?
[144:16.90]And then all of a sudden it's like, oh, no, I'm not, like, I'm not.
[144:19.71]Oh, bye-bye-bye.
[144:20.69]No, no, no, no.
[144:21.15]I'm, like, going to kill you all.
[144:23.41]That probably happens, right?
[144:26.65]Here we go.
[144:27.11]Ooh, 80.
[144:32.86]Very cool.
[144:33.20]Alright, what else do I got?
[144:34.80]Oh, who have I met?
[144:35.74]I've not met three other people.
[144:53.33]Merciful end.
[144:58.87]Wait, there's two other weapons?
[145:04.17]What the hell are you talking about?
[145:05.53]Alright, I think I want to do a key run.
[145:15.06]That makes that so much better.
[145:16.04]Okay, 60% now.
[145:23.35]Damages from behind.
[145:24.09]40%.
[145:25.15]The power of darkness.
[145:30.53]Yeah, I did get a bunch of gems.
[145:31.39]That's right.
[145:35.92]Oh, wait, you're back.
[145:37.22]Oh, let's eavesdrop.
[145:38.16]You are not to aid him in these matters, Nyx.
[145:41.18]His foolishness is to be scorned and reprimanded, not indulged.
[145:46.22]Do we have an understanding?
[145:52.07]we have an understanding Hades yes he is your own son after all and therefore your responsibility I in turn have my commitments to this realm and to this house you're gonna read chat I do way more than you think I do in your debt it is not necessary to remind me surely all those who once defied my brothers and myself would much prefer a post within my house over eternity within the lowest depths of tartarus
[146:21.92]Not that the darkness there would trouble you.
[146:27.01]You know how a lot of you guys say, how did you miss what they were just talking about?
[146:31.95]How is it possible that you missed everything that just said?
[146:34.65]They just said it.
[146:35.41]Well, because I wasn't paying attention to them.
[146:37.34]I was paying attention to you.
[146:39.26]I was reading your lore during that.
[146:43.32]I have no idea what they just said.
[146:44.98]I have absolutely no fucking idea at all.
[146:47.14]I was looking at over here.
[146:48.08]I was seeing like what's going on over here in like the stadium.
[146:58.26]The arena.
[146:59.58]The stadium.
[147:01.78]Stadium with... 6,600 people in the stadium for tonight's game.
[147:07.63]We are... We are the Cincinnati Reds.
[147:12.01]Is that sports?
[147:24.04]Yeah.
[147:27.32]Wasn't there a season where the Cincinnati Reds lost like 14 games in a season or something?
[147:37.91]Yeah?
[147:39.09]Aw, that's so sad.
[147:41.07]That's sad, man.
[147:44.41]Okay, chambers may contain urns.
[147:46.35]I think it's time to get this.
[147:49.68]Smash everything, right?
[147:52.38]Or...
[147:54.06]Fountain chamber and Elysium.
[147:56.52]Underworld fountains.
[147:57.72]Holy.
[147:58.96]Fountains provide more health than usual.
[148:00.80]That's even better.
[148:02.16]Smash pots.
[148:07.97]Smash pots and add a fountain to Elysium.
[148:20.92]I like the sound of this.
[148:22.26]Work approved and here's the fee, good contractor.
[148:25.78]And I want two curtains.
[148:34.43]I want a scrying pool.
[148:37.75]Here are the gems.
[148:39.17]Should make a nice enough addition to my chambers.
[148:47.35]And I thought I thought I said bug safety.
[148:55.14]Achilles is gone.
[148:56.24]What are you talking about?
[149:01.39]Excuse me.
[149:02.21]Pardon me.
[149:05.74]Listen to what?
[149:06.52]Oh, I could have just listened to something.
[149:07.80]Go back.
[149:08.08]No!
[149:12.18]No!
[149:21.85]What's this?
[149:22.96]Renovate.
[149:23.46]Oh.
[149:24.22]Just what I always wanted.
[149:27.58]Can I go in that?
[149:29.54]A beautifully decorated, subtly enchanted ball containing traces of the hapless prince's past attempts to flee the underworld now accents a particularly cluttered corner of his room.
[149:42.79]Always wanted my own scrying pool.
[149:45.68]Just need to keep at it.
[149:46.80]Escape attempted.
[149:48.40]Oh, it tells you how... Okay.
[149:50.18]Killed 1,700 people.
[149:51.38]It's tried to escape six times.
[149:53.98]Go to bed.
[149:58.10]Earlier.
[149:59.38]What is this?
[150:03.93]Prince of the underworld, Zagreus, rises from a fitful slumber with much mischief on his mind.
[150:12.43]Mischief?
[150:13.05]Me?
[150:13.77]I was just going to have a little look through Father's stuff.
[150:18.90]Okay.
[150:19.32]I'm trying to sneak around my dad's quarters.
[150:21.74]They're gonna put peanut butter in his slippers.
[150:48.05]he ventures toward the stately throne of his lord father half expecting to be caught but ill expecting what he is about to find I said shut up old man he does not know exactly what he seeks what is this like he only knows that something always has felt off to him that he does not belong who is he really lord Hades never would indulge such questions
[151:17.27]So Prince Agrius would find out for himself.
[151:21.86]I'm not listening.
[151:22.58]Let's see.
[151:24.26]What are we going to look at?
[151:26.18]He rifles through his lord father's possessions.
[151:28.46]Who he's been writing to.
[151:29.18]There is not much of any import there.
[151:31.94]Ledgers and administrative parchment work.
[151:35.06]Correspondence from Olympus which he had ignored.
[151:38.22]No trace of any reference to his son.
[151:47.38]but then there is the note note written finally in a hand and voice the likes of which the prince had never seen or heard Hades I can no longer tolerate my life here in this place oh it's from perspiron so I'm leaving even if it kills me I won't be returning to olympus if there is a place where I belong in this world it must be somewhere between heaven and hell perhaps it's on the coast and has a little garden
[152:17.75]Take care of Cerberus.
[152:19.77]I shall miss him.
[152:21.63]Persephone.
[152:22.19]Persephone.
[152:24.12]I said that wrong all the time.
[152:35.24]Like Steve Bruhl.
[152:36.66]Persephone or Stephanie.
[152:39.18]My name is Persephone.
[152:40.28]I should be Stephanie.
[152:40.90]What?
[152:41.06]Oh, what the heck?
[152:41.64]No way.
[152:42.78]Persephone is Zagoras' mother.
[153:02.87]And Hades is Zagros' father, and he thought his mother was Nyx, and they've been keeping this secret from him forever.
[153:08.21]But why?
[153:09.31]Let me know in the comments what you think, why they're hiding that from Zagros.
[153:12.67]I'll see you next time for episode 145 of our playthrough of Hades.
[153:38.56]Persephone, the one-time queen of all the underworld.
[153:43.05]Where had she gone, and why?
[153:46.57]Engulfed by many questions and his rage, the prince decided to confront his lord and master.
[153:53.29]145 streams of Hades.
[153:55.64]Uh-oh.
[154:02.38]Mommy, you've been lying to me this whole time.
[154:04.72]Why?
[154:08.05]Wait, or should I say, not mommy.
[154:10.97]You, you're, Nyx, you're not my mother.
[154:15.77]All this time, you and my father, you, you lied to me.
[154:21.30]Oh, my dear child.
[154:23.62]So now you know.
[154:25.62]So now you know.
[154:27.18]But only half the truth.
[154:29.38]I can explain the rest, so please.
[154:33.86]It never was my wish to hurt you.
[154:35.62]Who cares?
[154:43.06]Mother, I wonder will you even remember me?
[154:52.49]I mean, you are my mother.
[154:54.44]Who cares?
[155:16.89]I kind of want to... This is too good to take off.
[155:24.67]I'm never going to be able to take this off ever again.
[155:30.68]I like all this, but this one... This is... I can die so many times.
[155:37.56]This is 50% I get to die once.
[155:41.84]Isn't this better?
[155:54.69]Restore a small amount of health when you enter a chamber.
[155:56.87]Three health when you go in a chamber versus... No, no, no, no.
[156:01.13]I like this better.
[156:02.39]I like it.
[156:02.75]I'm keeping it.
[156:03.19]Alright, let's go.
[156:04.16]I don't have enough to do anything anyways.
[156:09.56]You can die twice if you buy more of those.
[156:11.34]Well, it's 600.
[156:12.72]That's a huge amount of... So many of you...
[156:18.97]are here to enjoy this game thank you for being here each day I didn't say that counts but whatever 20 subs for you pal
[156:46.97]There's another- there's another weapon?
[156:48.67]I didn't know there was another- oh, I thought this was gonna be DLC.
[156:51.39]There are two more weapons?
[156:52.59]What?
[156:53.07]It's a giant glove.
[157:15.24]Oh, it's eight keys.
[157:16.78]No, they're trying to keep me here forever.
[157:18.46]I need to find a key.
[157:25.16]That one looks interesting.
[157:28.82]Alright, this is the next one you find will be from Dionysius.
[157:33.76]Alright, we're going to go with the meta here.
[157:39.66]And, hmm.
[157:43.16]Aegis, protect me.
[157:45.86]I am absolutely a shield guy.
[158:01.49]I'm a shield guy.
[158:10.42]Let's go.
[158:18.91]Use bow?
[158:19.62]Not yet.
[158:19.90]Alright, this is specifically what we're doing here is... We're getting a cutscene?
[158:29.72]Hold on.
[158:30.66]Are you... Are you telling me that I... I almost beat the game before getting all the abilities and before seeing the first, like, you're out of the tutorial cutscene?
[158:51.48]Holy shit.
[158:52.08]Wow.
[158:53.48]Well, that's too bad.
[158:56.66]It's just the edge I need.
[159:01.28]Your dash strike deals 50%... That's... Okay.
[159:03.86]That's really good.
[159:07.30]That's the bounce.
[159:10.58]This charges up faster, but... I'm going for the dash.
[159:16.08]Daedalus power.
[159:24.09]50% more damage.
[159:31.13]Die Dallas Hammer.
[159:32.87]He doesn't know.
[159:33.49]No, I don't.
[159:34.77]I don't know what you're referring to.
[159:44.94]I'm absolutely a shield guy.
[159:46.70]No doubt in my mind.
[159:59.52]Thank the gods.
[160:02.32]Chthonic coin... What?
[160:04.22]Chthonic coin... Received... Oh!
[160:08.07]That's 125 now.
[160:08.31]Okay.
[160:29.91]Play Portal 2?
[160:32.17]No, it makes me throw up after 45 minutes and I have to stop.
[160:45.90]Ooh, and Dionysus.
[160:47.17]Here we go.
[160:47.67]It's time for a bleed build.
[160:50.31]It took me like two weeks to beat Portal 2 when it first came out.
[160:53.53]After 45 minutes, I have to stop.
[160:56.01]Hangover damage.
[160:56.95]Here we go.
[160:57.41]That's probably the one I want.
[160:58.13]Because that bounces around.
[161:18.27]Why?
[161:18.51]I don't know.
[161:18.85]It's something about it.
[161:20.18]Something about the... Falling through the portals and seeing the... I don't know.
[161:25.86]It just fucks with my head and makes me sick.
[161:28.36]Especially the first game.
[161:38.57]Actually, one's probably better.
[161:42.71]And we get chaos right off the bat.
[161:44.19]This could be a pretty good run.
[161:47.01]Wait, I gotta break the... Okay, is it... Wait, I got a question.
[162:01.71]Is the... Should I just break every single vase now?
[162:05.37]Or is it very specific?
[162:06.67]It looks very different.
[162:12.93]It's just gold pots.
[162:14.09]Okay.
[162:16.85]What artifact?
[162:17.61]What is he talking about?
[162:39.33]Alright, for the next three encounters, you have... That's awful.
[162:42.97]Afterwards, boons have a 16% chance to be rare, but that's not very good.
[162:49.67]Take 370%... Okay, I die instantly from traps, but afterward I get 33% more max health.
[162:56.04]Or... Each time you attack, get hit for 4 damage, but any money you find is worth 35% more.
[163:02.80]I'm just gonna kill myself.
[163:09.74]How would I do this?
[163:10.34]Would I have to kill everything with my cast or with the special?
[163:18.14]Just use your special.
[163:19.14]I'm going to try it.
[163:21.10]I'm going for it.
[163:21.78]Because that's not an attack technically, right?
[163:25.28]Did I just get hurt?
[163:40.77]Alright, just play safe.
[163:42.89]Just don't attack.
[163:49.62]And look at this.
[163:51.36]I hit the jackpot.
[163:53.62]Re-encounter.
[163:56.64]Wait, fish?
[164:01.00]What the hell?
[164:02.10]I was trying to activate fish rod.
[164:08.57]No fish?
[164:22.81]Well, this is gonna take a lot longer than I thought.
[164:24.45]Oh boy, this is a bad idea, wouldn't it?
[164:32.69]Shit.
[164:33.65]Come here.
[164:38.83]Come on.
[164:56.05]Kill that little shit.
[165:08.44]Back.
[165:08.92]Back.
[165:09.48]Back.
[165:10.44]That's not bad.
[165:11.28]We're fine.
[165:16.80]Aphrodite.
[165:17.16]I haven't seen Aphrodite in a very long time.
[165:18.98]But I can't do that one.
[165:20.45]Wait.
[165:20.67]Is that the only door I can go in?
[165:26.60]Alright, plus 50% more damage on your special.
[165:29.21]None of these is helping.
[165:43.03]Gain plus one for your cast.
[165:45.88]That's so much money, though.
[165:51.91]I have to take it.
[165:53.56]Otherwise, I'm not going to be able to complete this next encounter.
[165:56.33]I physically won't be able to do it.
[165:57.63]This is an elite room.
[166:20.02]This motherfucker has all my cubes I'm so dead, it's over
[166:52.18]Block?
[166:52.82]If I... I can't... Alright, whatever, just... I don't care.
[167:00.70]Just restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart, restart.
[167:03.61]Why am I still alive?
[167:04.81]The curse can't kill you.
[167:16.98]Yeah, that was, that was, that was over.
[167:19.58]Just rip the bandaid off.
[167:20.62]Let's go.
[167:27.79]You called upon your humble court musician, as I understand, Lord Hades, sir.
[167:32.37]Referring to myself, of course.
[167:35.55]Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[167:39.02]That was very bad.
[167:40.72]I'll redo that.
[167:42.66]Remind yourself that overconfidence is a slow and insidious killer.
[167:46.77]That was much better.
[167:47.65]I had to give it some effort.
[167:49.11]Still bad.
[167:49.79]And that guy for life for saying that about me and my voice acting skills.
[167:55.00]I have to say there isn't another death.
[167:56.84]Another underworld.
[168:19.89]That guy just died of old age.
[168:20.83]What are you doing here?
[168:24.11]Isn't this supposed to be like serial killers?
[168:28.23]I'm in hell?
[168:30.03]That guy just died of old age.
[168:31.43]What did he do?
[168:38.66]What's new?
[168:42.03]Hades is, oh, wait, it's not heaven and hell?
[168:46.85]What's hell in Greek mythology?
[168:54.14]Primordial chaos.
[168:56.74]Indeed, I know them well.
[168:59.24]They must have taken interest in your quest.
[169:01.92]I would advise that you beware their offerings, though know that chaos, whilst a trickster, is not a deceiver.
[169:15.27]Hades is a place and a person.
[169:19.48]Right.
[169:21.06]Can serial killers not die from old age?
[169:23.18]No, but wouldn't you think it would say, like, was a serial killer underneath it?
[169:25.90]50%.
[169:31.21]Let's go.
[169:32.57]Nix's strength.
[169:43.79]Alright, I got the shield still.
[169:46.29]I want to unlock the glove.
[169:47.33]There's other skellies?
[169:49.39]Every time I get into a little string like this, I just feel like I'm playing Smash Bros.
[170:13.44]Just like get in and... Mash buttons.
[170:24.27]It's not mashing buttons.
[170:25.39]You do a string of things together.
[170:26.91]You go... I put this... This is on, right?
[170:34.98]Oh, this is even better that I restarted.
[170:36.40]It's 125 gold.
[170:39.40]At least dead now.
[170:46.93]you mash them in the right order Aphrodite right off the bat and Aphrodite has not received a gift take one Lady Aphrodite I am truly blessed simply to have made your acquaintance so this is for you lasting relationships are built on reciprocity given all my gifts to Aphrodite what am I to do but give you something in return
[171:17.01]Eternal Rose.
[171:17.43]Her icon looks the tastiest.
[171:18.49]That's how I've been determining which one I want.
[171:36.02]I feel like that one would taste the best.
[171:38.24]The icon.
[171:39.48]The icon.
[171:40.56]The icon, folks.
[171:41.90]The icon.
[171:43.18]It's like a candy heart.
[171:44.78]We have, like, crispy, cold, chilly, like, spearmint gum.
[171:49.35]We have, like, the wing, like the baby back ribs for Hermes.
[171:52.83]I'm basing it on the icon.
[171:55.39]Not?
[171:56.37]Okay.
[171:57.19]Relax.
[172:00.13]Well, that's a good start.
[172:03.30]That's also a good start.
[172:12.05]I don't need to relax.
[172:13.00]He wouldn't let me finish my sentence.
[172:15.56]I'm like, oh, I base it on what I find.
[172:17.54]What looks the tastiest.
[172:20.22]He's a sicko.
[172:21.68]Icon.
[172:22.28]He didn't let me finish.
[172:23.00]Oh.
[172:26.59]Yeah, first one.
[172:30.65]44 damage already?
[172:31.19]I'm sick.
[172:43.36]Alright, let's go.
[172:48.00]Come and get it.
[172:48.98]Focus time.
[172:51.98]And I like how there's little hearts after you do stuff.
[173:06.96]Who's left?
[173:09.42]Oh, there's nobody left.
[173:10.66]Got it.
[173:13.91]Ooh, this is two good upgrades right in a row.
[173:21.60]I can't even, you guys are fucking crazy.
[173:37.05]Bam.
[173:43.04]Hmm.
[173:45.24]Your attack hits twice.
[173:46.68]I mean, it has.
[173:51.83]Dude, you're looking like a snack.
[174:02.57]Who, me?
[174:10.26]Yep.
[174:12.32]That's good.
[174:13.42]Go boy.
[174:15.12]I'm sorry.
[174:16.58]That was very bad.
[174:17.58]I may have been trying to do like a hillbilly voice.
[174:29.95]Oh, bad.
[174:31.25]That's good.
[174:32.07]I can't even, you can't even do that.
[174:39.00]I forgot an urn?
[174:39.96]What?
[174:40.18]I didn't even know what they were.
[174:41.08]What does it look like?
[174:41.80]I missed out.
[174:42.44]Oh, he's stupid.
[174:44.77]He's stupid.
[174:45.09]He's dumb.
[174:45.51]Don't let him forget it.
[174:53.87]Give me more.
[175:03.74]It's gonna be just like the... Um...
[175:11.22]uh the um yeah a certain thing in a certain game that shows up that I miss all the time and there's something in this certain thing that I will not make a reference to and it shows up in some rooms and it's differently colored and it's it's hard for me to see them sometimes
[175:45.34]I don't... I want the... Why is it... I want the heart.
[175:52.55]Should help keep me going.
[175:54.47]Your dash deals damage when you end up inflicting weak.
[175:57.43]Weak afflicted foes are also more susceptible to damage.
[176:03.26]I mean, it should be... it's two.
[176:09.38]I feel fabulous.
[176:14.11]Does that say?
[176:15.63]35 unmarried is embarrassed by his job, physically deformed.
[176:26.03]What did I do to you, man?
[176:26.69]What did I do to you?
[176:41.77]That's like I just gave you two seconds to scream at me and that you just you got to get it all out.
[176:48.83]I had to ask.
[176:50.81]Another Aphrodite door.
[177:01.73]Actually banned that guy.
[177:02.67]That was rude.
[177:03.39]I can't.
[177:08.10]I can't.
[177:08.50]I mean he's wicked mean but
[177:12.46]I can't spam everybody.
[177:23.47]Holy shit, this is a great build.
[177:27.85]In the name of Hades.
[177:42.59]It's just revenge damage, but... When you... Definitely two.
[177:47.47]Yeah, they blow up.
[177:48.13]Remember, don't let anybody shame you for your life.
[177:56.75]Alright, let me be honest.
[177:57.81]Okay, let's break that down for a second.
[178:01.62]Yeah, I'm 35.
[178:01.88]Who cares?
[178:04.35]You just get, age gets better with wine.
[178:06.59]Except in my case, when you have, like, spinal disc problems, you have a hernia that needs surgery, and you, uh, and you need to take baths every day.
[178:14.49]Alright, hey, how dare you?
[178:16.19]Second of all, unmarried.
[178:20.60]What if I don't want to get married?
[178:22.00]What if I want to be complete, what if I just want to, what if I just want to live for me, man?
[178:25.90]Okay, number three.
[178:28.56]Uh, what was the third one?
[178:35.98]He's balding so hard that I was, like, physically... Alright.
[178:46.07]Let me play my fucking computer game.
[178:48.73]Let me play my computer game!
[178:54.15]That's for last time.
[179:12.21]Dude, this triple hit.
[179:13.31]Look at 300, 400, 500, 600, 700, 500, 800, 900, 1000.
[179:13.81]Give me some synergy here, come on.
[179:14.67]Give me some synergy here, please.
[179:15.79]Synergy.
[179:15.97]That's cool.
[179:36.62]Everyone's gonna marry his computer.
[179:43.22]Oh, yep.
[179:44.80]There it is.
[179:45.36]There it is.
[179:49.30]Who cares about Blade Rift when I can just go like this and they take a shitload of damage?
[180:00.87]Get VR married.
[180:06.81]You know, I'm surprised there is not a VR get married simulator by now.
[180:12.59]Where you are the groom and the bride comes down the aisle and you exchange vows and stuff.
[180:18.64]There is.
[180:20.26]Well, then I'm going to play it.
[180:21.86]I have to play that.
[180:22.72]I have to play the get married simulator.
[180:31.10]Seema Shanzi just gave 10 community subs.
[180:33.45]Thank you, Seema.
[180:37.04]Appreciate the subs.
[180:38.06]10 subs just dropped in.
[180:48.90]What happened to me?
[180:49.64]Oh, that's his move.
[180:51.87]Yeah, dude.
[180:52.21]This shit is a get in and get out move set.
[180:54.73]Get in.
[180:55.37]Get out.
[180:56.75]Get in.
[180:57.11]Get out.
[180:57.63]Get in.
[180:57.89]Get out.
[180:58.77]Get in.
[180:59.17]Get out.
[180:59.95]Get in.
[181:01.75]Get in.
[181:02.07]Get out.
[181:04.19]Get in.
[181:04.41]Get out.
[181:05.43]Get in.
[181:15.40]Pomegranate.
[181:18.67]But I missed another- In and out.
[181:20.91]Animal style.
[181:21.49]Fuck.
[181:21.81]I'm missing so many things.
[181:38.46]Fishing!
[181:40.46]Don't let me miss that.
[181:42.00]I want a thousand people to unsub if I miss that.
[182:04.42]Imagine not being shield guy.
[182:07.40]Imagine thinking anything else in this game was as adequate as shield guy is.
[182:14.21]Oh, yes.
[182:22.02]94%.
[182:22.06]Pogged out?
[182:26.86]I'm pogged out too, man.
[182:27.86]I can only pog so many times.
[182:29.36]Fish.
[182:31.26]Let's fish.
[182:36.40]Knucklehead?
[182:37.12]I got a perfect catch.
[182:39.72]Cool.
[182:49.14]Um, should I just take that?
[182:53.72]No, not worth it.
[182:54.32]I can just get him from here.
[182:59.84]Alright, well now at least I know what that looks like.
[183:11.65]In and out style.
[183:24.92]I love it.
[183:26.04]I love this shield.
[183:26.96]It's the best weapon.
[183:30.46]I don't think glove can compare.
[183:31.87]I really don't.
[183:44.32]I'm just cleaning up.
[183:45.16]Do you see any fish?
[183:51.08]I don't see any fish.
[183:54.21]Is Greek mythology pog or not pog?
[183:56.01]It's pog.
[183:57.07]It's really pog, actually.
[183:58.05]Survive for 45 seconds.
[183:59.45]Seriously?
[184:14.84]Yeah, more than that.
[184:17.02]Talking about a shield user.
[184:50.25]No, I don't think so.
[184:51.65]How many keys do I have?
[184:53.49]Three.
[185:16.00]I'm just hamstringing myself for no reason because I just leave the... I just go.
[185:19.59]I'm like, let's go.
[185:20.29]I'm ready.
[185:28.93]You need to relax.
[185:29.79]I am very relaxed.
[185:31.21]I just want... I'm ready to open the door.
[185:38.24]No.
[185:40.64]No.
[185:41.70]No.
[185:43.42]Oh, I'm so mad.
[185:44.56]He's defeated.
[185:48.74]I mean, but I just got a little happier right here.
[185:58.53]Your call fires a seeking arrow with a 35% crit chance.
[186:02.47]The arrows do 120 damage, and it fires 10 arrows if you let it fill all the way.
[186:14.64]Which would be just base 1200 damage with a 35% crit.
[186:21.98]If even one of those crits, which you would assume that statistically three and a half of them will.
[186:30.47]Talk about like 1500 damage.
[186:33.47]1600 damage, maybe.
[186:38.21]I'm going to fill the bar.
[186:50.13]I'm gonna take a pee break after this and get some water Crit is 3x Was it a sneeze?
[187:06.14]Bless you I have some bad news for you Meg Little by little I'm getting stronger
[187:15.80]aren't I killing her over and over again she's talking like she's killing me over and over again that may be so but you'll never be my equal ever you'd do well to remember that he's got this kind of backwards I think look at that damage
[187:45.35]Already sick.
[187:46.19]Don't get cocky.
[188:08.91]Oh, I was trying to stay in the middle.
[188:11.52]You just called that an airstrike?
[188:19.31]Our UAV is online.
[188:21.23]Our UAV is airborne.
[188:40.16]Excuse me.
[188:43.19]Watch out for the guy behind you!
[188:56.03]Get the fuck out of here, Meg.
[189:05.74]Fifty, that's a lot.
[189:16.53]Anybody see anything?
[189:17.05]I'm paranoid to open the door.
[189:31.87]Go get water and pee.
[189:32.69]Yeah, I will in a second.
[189:34.43]Oh, I don't even need to.
[189:38.96]Thanks for the tip.
[189:41.42]Uh, the fountain doesn't even do anything.
[189:45.02]Full health already.
[189:48.22]Here comes a Family Guy funny hell moment.
[189:55.26]Wait, what is this?
[189:57.58]Oh, it's just you can... Aphrodite gives you this thing.
[190:01.13]Uh... I have the money, so I'm just gonna buy it.
[190:16.53]Alright, I'll be right back.
[190:17.11]I'm just going to pee and grab a water.
[190:19.31]I'll be back in like two, three minutes.
[190:27.09]Fucking hate streaming.
[190:28.75]Fucking am so done.
[190:29.71]I'm fucking never streaming again.
[190:32.05]Like after tonight, it's fucking, I'm done streaming.
[190:35.13]I'm so on, the mic is on.
[190:37.23]I'll be right back.
[195:45.07]I'm here.
[195:45.59]I'm here.
[195:45.81]I'm just... I'm eating.
[196:02.81]No, you know what?
[196:03.36]I've been into these new streamer snacks.
[196:07.90]Um... These little turkey jerkies.
[196:11.60]They're like Slim Jims, but they're
[196:16.23]Not full of trash, I guess you could say.
[196:23.59]And this is coming from somebody that I love Slim Jims.
[196:25.77]I do.
[196:26.87]But they are dog shit.
[196:30.17]Did you guys know that if you ate 1,600 Slim Jims in a row, you'd die?
[196:38.04]Did you know that?
[196:45.09]1,400 Slim Jims, actually.
[196:47.15]If you eat 1,400 Slim Jims, you will die.
[196:50.97]Because of the sodium nitrate in Slim Jims.
[197:03.02]That's so fucking funny.
[197:05.31]Just eat, yeah, just eat the thousand of them.
[197:07.41]You'll be alright.
[197:20.01]Okay, if you type in how many Slim Jims kill you into Google, you get a IGN forum of somebody saying, being very concerned that they ate 15 Slim Jims and they're concerned.
[197:38.06]My mouth and throat are coated in grease.
[197:42.73]Or whatever that orange slimy goo is that oozes out when you squeeze a Slim Jim.
[197:47.13]I feel so gross right now and I think I'm having chest pains.
[197:51.43]What the fuck?
[197:52.49]20- like, 23rd- 2014.
[197:59.10]Holy shit.
[198:13.02]Okay, I don't... It's not... I'm not talking about me.
[198:18.79]I'm not... I didn't just eat 15 Slim Jims.
[198:28.50]I had these.
[198:29.45]They're organic turkey jerkies.
[198:32.21]They're completely and totally good.
[198:34.65]No bullshit.
[198:35.79]No crap in it.
[198:36.69]It's just like turkey smoked.
[198:39.19]Smoked turkey links.
[198:40.17]And that's it.
[198:40.61]And there's nothing else.
[198:41.39]And they're little.
[198:42.07]And I can have them on the street.
[198:43.07]Look, I don't eat.
[198:44.15]I eat Slim Jims once every like five years.
[198:51.02]Slim Jims are fine.
[198:52.04]They're good.
[198:52.76]They're delicious.
[198:53.50]They taste good.
[198:54.58]Just don't eat more than ten of them in a row.
[198:58.78]Don't eat 1,400 at the same time, because it'll kill you, apparently.
[199:04.22]By the way, if you eat 1,400 of anything at the same time, you're going to die.
[199:07.38]You could eat 1,400 bags of kale, and you're dead.
[199:10.28]You could eat 1,400 grams of salt.
[199:11.88]1,400 of anything will kill you.
[199:28.95]1,400 pieces of rice.
[199:42.14]That's true.
[199:43.56]You're right.
[199:44.62]But, actually, that's a lot, though.
[199:46.52]How much, wait, how many, how much, how much rice is in a bag of rice?
[199:54.06]How many grains of rice are in a bag?
[199:58.76]Probably not that many.
[200:04.35]One pound of rice is 7,000 grains.
[200:07.39]Alright, well there you go.
[200:08.05]You could eat 1,400 rice pellets and be fine.
[200:13.77]Going up.
[200:16.09]Alright, let's go.
[200:18.51]Let's do it.
[200:20.00]I have a good build.
[200:20.82]We're gonna totally own this.
[200:26.30]Change of scenery at least.
[200:30.80]What about four?
[200:31.46]I'm not even going to say that.
[200:35.54]Pomegranate.
[200:36.32]Perfect.
[200:44.74]Looks big.
[200:48.45]Look bigger than usual.
[200:51.11]No jokes.
[200:51.81]Play.
[200:53.03]Trying to beat the game tonight.
[200:56.11]Don't make like a funny remark.
[200:58.23]Oh, funny.
[201:02.32]You idiot.
[201:03.48]Oh, by the way, when I was downstairs, I was getting the jerky, I started laughing about, like, the 35-year-old, like, mean guy.
[201:11.18]I just, like, thought about his sentence.
[201:13.20]I was like, holy shit, that was, like, so fucking mean.
[201:15.42]I wonder if that person's still here.
[201:23.78]Yep.
[201:35.67]There it is again.
[201:37.19]Attack damage.
[201:41.44]Or... No.
[201:44.54]Or... No, that's 14%.
[201:51.35]No, no, no.
[201:52.79]This is better.
[201:53.27]This is straight up better than this one.
[201:59.47]Powered up.
[202:05.63]I could get... Yes, Hermes is going to bail us out here.
[202:10.95]We're going to get bailed out by Hermes.
[202:22.88]He's going to give us like 30% faster attack speed or something crazy.
[202:25.84]We're going to get like a legendary from him.
[202:27.42]Can't wait.
[202:34.78]I don't have a cast yet.
[202:37.10]Alright, we gotta figure that out.
[202:38.68]There's no cast.
[202:39.10]Oh, shit.
[202:48.29]Oh, shit.
[203:02.54]Taking way too much damage right now, and I'm not happy about it.
[203:07.82]Please play something else so I can watch.
[203:09.26]I don't want spoilers.
[203:10.26]Shit, what do we do?
[203:12.96]I don't know, man.
[203:13.36]I don't know what to do.
[203:14.02]It's too good to not take every time.
[203:33.21]That's very good.
[203:36.53]For 10 seconds.
[203:40.03]But I just always dash more.
[203:45.61]Always dash.
[203:46.29]It's always dash.
[203:47.03]It is.
[203:47.37]Every time.
[203:52.58]Don't have enough money to do much in the shop, so I'm going to go hard mode and get more Aphrodite bonus combo duo double barbecue bacon bunker burger.
[204:12.20]Aphrodite.
[204:12.56]I very much appreciate it.
[204:21.92]What is it now?
[204:26.34]Your weak effects are more potent.
[204:27.96]Weak damage reduction 10%.
[204:29.82]Victim deals at least 30... It's going to be 40% less damage now.
[204:38.27]But... Am I just going to be a one-button Barry?
[204:49.23]I guess so.
[204:53.02]I forgot you were in the game.
[204:54.64]It's been a while.
[204:55.26]Get away.
[205:24.42]Oh, that's the thing that hits me?
[205:25.50]Are you really kidding me?
[205:26.50]Come on, just bully this guy.
[206:01.37]One shot.
[206:01.85]There it is.
[206:09.76]Your health, your health, your health.
[206:11.54]Cry.
[206:11.96]Cry?
[206:13.62]Why are you saying that?
[206:16.34]You guys are... Christ.
[206:29.39]Only 2%.
[206:30.35]Damn it.
[206:35.86]Now I kind of wish I took the special from the last one.
[206:40.46]This can be upgraded though, right?
[206:54.23]That can be upgraded.
[206:54.97]Probably to like 5 or 6%.
[207:01.93]Alright, this is interesting.
[207:05.71]I need to take the health, I think.
[207:07.95]It's getting bad.
[207:11.81]Well, thank you.
[207:16.35]How much more jerky do I have?
[207:17.92]I want extra jerky.
[207:24.58]Did I see the Power Stone news?
[207:29.18]I did not.
[207:31.40]Uh, what would do better with this build, Ares or Dionysus?
[207:39.90]Probably Ares.
[207:42.78]Hope I can do it.
[207:43.32]Hope I don't get my ass kicked.
[207:51.97]Oh god, this is not good.
[208:02.23]Not good.
[208:04.33]Not good.
[208:12.79]Holy shit.
[208:22.32]Come on.
[208:22.76]Get over here so I don't... Get closer.
[208:27.70]Even closer than that, please.
[208:29.88]Closer than that, please.
[208:31.50]Get closer than that.
[208:32.44]I can't hit... I don't want to die here.
[208:52.32]Yes!
[208:53.94]Didn't die.
[208:55.40]What can you do?
[209:05.16]Hmm.
[209:09.02]Three is, I mean... Does that include bosses?
[209:14.34]And does it stack?
[209:19.72]Capcom's making a new Power Stone game?
[209:26.78]Then that's what I want.
[209:27.58]Okay.
[209:33.32]That's pretty awesome.
[209:34.30]Took him long enough.
[209:35.04]Took him like 25 years to do that.
[209:36.22]Okay, anybody see an urn that I can break or something?
[209:37.97]Or health or treasure or anything?
[210:04.98]Hey, something funny, funny man.
[210:06.30]That was a slow one.
[210:18.21]That was like a, I'm just pressing it down and letting it go because you told me to.
[210:21.75]Ooh, okay, this is good.
[210:37.13]I can upgrade the crit one, maybe.
[210:39.53]You ready to see how can you cook so much with all the searing heat around these parts?
[210:43.85]Has it been magma flooded like this all the time?
[210:48.18]Something unfunny now.
[210:50.02]Now you got you got your one guy moment.
[210:52.62]Not getting another one.
[210:54.24]The steering heat.
[210:56.46]I am dead.
[210:57.32]Your Royal Majesty.
[210:58.92]Searing is just a cooking technique to me.
[211:01.12]Don't need to sleep either.
[211:02.42]I can just keep cooking up a storm.
[211:04.45]It's not so bad.
[211:14.15]Up to four random boons get a level.
[211:17.49]Two random boons are upgraded to the next rarity.
[211:21.18]We just have to pray that it's... Wait a minute.
[211:24.76]I only have two.
[211:28.96]I only have two boons.
[211:38.27]I have five?
[211:39.25]I do?
[211:39.75]Look on the left side of the screen, though.
[211:41.21]Don't I only have two?
[211:50.48]Up to two could mean just one.
[211:54.24]You have eight.
[211:56.16]Oh.
[212:05.64]Okay, it's either that one or I level it up.
[212:09.10]I'm going for it.
[212:10.16]Two random boons get upgraded.
[212:12.50]One.
[212:13.20]Two.
[212:18.26]Three.
[212:18.54]Did I get it?
[212:21.83]One of those is legendary.
[212:27.35]Oh, that's crazy.
[212:29.67]What?
[212:29.87]What?
[212:37.36]But that's good, though.
[212:40.08]That's good.
[212:51.61]That's good.
[212:52.35]I need health, though.
[212:55.71]Straight up more damage right across the board.
[212:57.17]Yeah, that was worth it.
[212:59.21]Good dice roll.
[213:01.83]No health.
[213:05.06]I have to be so careful.
[213:06.10]Alright, don't blow this.
[213:07.42]I'm gonna get some health right here.
[213:11.20]Alright, let's go.
[213:38.24]Hello?
[213:40.95]Burn, burn him, burn him!
[213:43.75]Burn!
[213:44.79]Burn this thing!
[214:00.96]Get out of the fire, I can't hurt you.
[214:03.06]Hello?
[214:16.13]Wowie Wowie Wow
[214:36.63]Kill these little shits.
[214:52.53]Didn't even take a single lick of damage.
[215:01.60]I mean, at this point I think I have to hope for health in the shop.
[215:15.78]Pomegranate's good, but I need to be sure.
[215:20.33]And... Nice work.
[215:22.65]Excellent, excellent, excellent.
[215:25.01]That's very good.
[215:26.03]Time for the boss.
[215:40.99]I wish I could afford all this, but I can't.
[215:43.81]75 health is not good for where I am in the game right now.
[215:49.25]It really isn't.
[215:54.40]I need like 100 plus.
[215:57.42]Use the call at maximum.
[215:59.12]I'm going to try to this time.
[216:10.63]I still don't have a cast.
[216:21.99]This is absolutely mutilating though.
[216:32.16]We just gotta bully.
[216:32.84]We gotta bully the second they come up.
[216:38.80]Just bully.
[216:54.16]Just absolute bully.
[216:55.52]Careful.
[216:59.22]Careful.
[217:12.97]He's different.
[217:13.79]You notice that?
[217:14.55]He's got different stuff.
[217:19.11]What's going on?
[217:19.57]Why is he back there like that?
[217:20.61]Come on.
[217:31.80]Jesus.
[217:32.56]No, don't use it yet.
[217:33.22]Don't use it.
[217:53.54]Don't use it yet.
[217:54.18]No, don't use it.
[217:54.82]Alright, now... Use it now.
[218:05.88]Watch this.
[218:06.20]I'm going to kill him in one shot.
[218:07.64]Goodbye.
[218:09.17]And it's full health.
[218:28.78]So what did we learn today?
[218:31.16]We learned that during a boss fight, no matter what, wait until you are at full.
[218:42.82]So my idea here is when we get to Hades, don't even use it during the entire first encounter.
[218:51.65]Once the second encounter goes through, kill Hades in one shot.
[218:59.52]Once I get through phase one.
[219:00.32]That should be... This should be... And I put that in quotes.
[219:05.71]This should be the one.
[219:16.48]We'll see.
[219:30.00]Hmm.
[219:32.92]I'll save my money.
[219:34.62]The money needs to be saved because we're at the last area.
[219:41.44]Make sure you hold it.
[219:46.00]Wait a second so you don't waste it on iframes.
[219:48.26]Yeah.
[219:49.06]That's why I held it there too.
[219:51.28]I'm going to give it a full one or two seconds.
[219:53.12]And I don't want him to disappear.
[219:54.06]He goes invisible sometimes.
[219:55.06]I got one more zone here.
[220:00.73]And I've still got lots of upgrades to do.
[220:03.18]Alright, it's time.
[220:05.14]I need max HP.
[220:07.41]This is terrible.
[220:08.71]This is actually awful.
[220:13.51]What the hell was that?
[220:21.31]What the fuck was that?
[220:41.91]I might actually be in a little bit of trouble.
[220:43.81]Ow!
[220:56.14]Ow!
[221:12.54]This is taking a long time.
[221:14.44]WM1 gameplay?
[221:23.00]Use your cast?
[221:23.66]I don't have one.
[221:27.36]It's just dumpy.
[221:28.82]Look at this.
[221:40.95]Always hammer.
[221:56.50]I'm fooling.
[221:56.96]I'm fooling around here.
[222:00.38]I'm fooling around.
[222:09.03]Don't crash on me!
[222:10.01]I mean, don't... Actually, don't do that.
[222:13.11]It's like, true.
[222:20.93]Fuck.
[222:21.63]Sorry.
[222:21.81]What was I swinging?
[222:26.41]I was swinging at the wall.
[222:28.33]Hmm.
[222:50.10]Whatever.
[222:51.60]This is not a melee place.
[222:52.82]That's safe.
[223:09.74]After your special hits, your next two attacks deal 80% more damage.
[223:13.68]That's unbelievable.
[223:15.12]Your ball rush gains power and does 500% damage.
[223:18.64]So now that gives me a reason to use my special.
[223:23.57]Roll the Captain America shield.
[223:25.97]Get in.
[223:26.55]Tap, tap.
[223:27.03]Tap, tap.
[223:27.27]Gold urn.
[223:42.98]Five gold in there.
[223:43.88]That's horrible.
[223:48.39]I don't have enough for anything in the shop, so I'm going to go money.
[223:55.71]Where are the enemies?
[224:11.78]Hello?
[224:11.96]Where are they?
[224:25.31]Bad place to fight is those guys on the bridge.
[224:40.81]Who else?
[224:46.08]Oh, he's just hiding.
[224:53.77]Will you come out of hiding, please?
[225:08.06]Now I got enough money to really mess around.
[225:15.50]Oh.
[225:16.72]Artemis.
[225:17.98]For sure.
[225:19.72]Or... I could get the lightning jump thing.
[225:24.20]No, let's do Artemis.
[225:35.66]I don't want to get any projectiles.
[225:36.84]Just kill them.
[225:50.92]Spearman.
[225:54.93]Really?
[225:57.57]Who is it?
[225:57.93]Alright, there's a chest in here.
[226:00.05]Don't let me forget that.
[226:00.83]Okay.
[226:33.94]Gotta kill them faster.
[226:52.73]Good.
[226:54.15]Good.
[226:54.73]There's a chest.
[226:55.63]There, I see it.
[226:58.77]So Aphrodite reached you first, did she?
[227:01.91]Sounds exactly like something she'd do.
[227:03.91]She has a knack for trouble.
[227:05.25]And the shops.
[227:05.77]So let's just stay focused here.
[227:12.54]Oh my god.
[227:15.30]What do I have on now?
[227:17.24]Wait.
[227:24.18]But no, I don't want that.
[227:25.84]That replaces the double tap.
[227:31.46]The critical effects deal even more damage to armor.
[227:35.30]After you deal a crit, your foe is marked.
[227:42.25]Yeah, in the odd event that that does happen, that's probably better.
[227:44.71]Alright, must be nothing.
[227:51.17]Kill things fast, right?
[228:01.16]Give me my money!
[228:20.43]Wait.
[228:36.15]I couldn't even kill these guys faster than that.
[228:38.25]Ooh, but I will take some HP.
[228:41.69]Oh fuck.
[228:52.36]Oh my goodness.
[228:59.58]Excuse me!
[229:12.83]Holy shit, that was horrible.
[229:23.23]Get the bombs out of here and I'll be okay.
[229:30.92]Shitty room.
[229:31.72]Shitty room.
[229:32.50]Shitty room.
[229:45.99]Get this motherfucker killed by his own beams.
[229:49.27]Come up here.
[229:52.99]What did I do that for?
[229:54.59]I get hit by this.
[229:56.93]Damn it.
[229:57.29]He didn't get hit by it.
[229:57.91]I just freaked out.
[230:20.12]Nice shield, asshole.
[230:21.22]I haven't blocked in eight rooms.
[230:24.40]Yeah, but... I mean, come on.
[230:26.27]I'm trying.
[230:27.81]I'm all offense.
[230:30.71]Well, it looks like we're gonna go left.
[230:37.55]This guy is so good.
[230:38.54]This guy is unbelievable.
[230:39.72]He's so good.
[230:41.50]His upgrades are incredible.
[230:48.22]Don't need that this time.
[230:55.00]Oh, man.
[231:05.05]That's greedy.
[231:12.39]Thank you.
[231:13.83]It's greedy, I know, but it's damage.
[231:15.92]It's a lot of damage.
[231:26.27]Oh.
[231:26.59]My.
[231:27.01]Fucking.
[231:27.39]God.
[231:27.77]They're all bow users.
[231:49.43]Who's next?
[231:57.50]That guy's marked.
[231:59.26]That's what that means.
[231:59.80]Shut up.
[232:17.71]I have no idea what's going on.
[232:23.62]God damn it, man.
[232:26.79]Where is this guy?
[232:40.60]Did you actually come back, you piece of shit?
[232:45.10]Let me get in there and kill him!
[232:53.37]Oh, you piece of shit!
[232:57.57]You piece of fucking shit!
[232:59.27]I hate this shield, guys!
[233:03.83]These are my least favorite enemies in the whole game, by the way.
[233:17.12]They take forever to fucking kill.
[233:18.86]And then you have to kill them twice when they come back.
[233:22.06]Fuck these guys.
[233:22.74]They suck.
[233:24.34]Power of Olympus.
[233:27.26]Oh my goodness.
[233:39.07]What happened to being a shield guy?
[233:46.25]I gave up on that.
[233:47.91]Oh, these guys jump around so fast.
[234:17.17]Isolate them out.
[234:28.25]Oh, that's a pretty good idea, guys.
[234:29.76]Nice work.
[234:54.07]Look at all the damage you didn't take.
[234:55.47]Yeah, I know.
[235:04.03]Bully bully bully!
[235:24.11]Don't let these two assholes get new bodies.
[235:28.87]God damn it, he got a new fucking body.
[235:30.71]Fuck these guys.
[235:48.22]You actually hit me.
[235:49.18]You're hiding behind a fucking wall.
[235:51.10]Get out of here.
[235:51.88]Worst enemy in the fucking game.
[236:01.05]Shop time.
[236:09.22]I can get them all.
[236:09.94]This is perfect.
[236:10.84]And it's boss time.
[236:12.18]Alright, I gotta be ready.
[236:20.62]Kill bull first.
[236:21.48]I will.
[236:25.92]I'll try Alright
[236:50.92]So now I can go whack whack.
[236:52.92]This is just going to be a game.
[236:54.96]Get the hell out of here.

[236:56.40]Where?
[236:58.76]Kill the bull.
[237:00.38]Dodge.
[237:00.92]Dash around.
[237:01.82]Be careful.
[237:02.52]Be good.
[237:06.23]Where the hell did you even see that?
[237:07.41]I have no idea.
[237:08.15]Alright, I'm ready.
[237:15.37]Kill bull.
[237:17.71]Backstab bull.
[237:18.49]Get out.
[237:19.05]Dodge the fire.
[237:22.94]And save.
[237:24.02]Do not do Artemis.
[237:25.48]And block.
[237:28.68]Hold on.
[237:29.04]Not so fast.

[244:08.27]Oh shit!
[244:09.17]They call for a friend!
[244:11.25]I forgot about that!
[244:12.19]Slow and steady wins the race.
[244:20.04]The hare gets run over by a car.
[244:22.34]Don't remember- Forget that story.
[244:38.14]I don't know, that just scared the shit out of me.
[244:54.53]Why's he blocking?
[244:56.45]Oh, right.
[244:57.35]Goddess Dementor.
[244:59.55]Okay, easy, easy, easy, easy, easy.
[245:02.46]Easy.
[245:04.26]Where'd he go?
[245:06.44]Oh, he's right there!
[245:11.48]Jesus Christ!
[245:13.63]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no!
[245:16.39]No, no, no, no, no!
[245:19.19]Oh, no!
[245:22.43]Oh, no!
[245:23.66]Oh, no!
[245:25.52]It's fucking so hard!
[245:32.59]holy shit oh no no it's so hard I want a rematch now damn it oh hey there dusa how's your endless toil treating you
[245:55.09]Afro damage falls off if you don't find the right stuff.
[245:58.26]Hmm.
[245:58.56]Damn.
[245:58.68]I thought I had it too.
[246:26.05]I just got caught in the... The purple circles.
[246:36.32]I can give the fish to the chef.
[246:37.52]That's cool.
[246:37.76]Song.
[246:37.86]I think this is important.
[246:38.50]The lament in the blood or the Argonauts.
[246:40.18]Uh...
[246:58.73]The Argonauts.
[247:00.29]How about Argonauts?
[247:01.53]Didn't you sail with them?
[247:04.53]Oh, fancy that one, do you?
[247:06.45]Alas, I've not the heart to sing it anymore.
[247:09.95]I'm glad you like it, though.
[247:12.22]Do I have enough to unlock the... I don't think I do.
[247:15.56]Alright, let's listen to the shirt.
[247:19.90]Wait, you don't know the song?
[247:22.50]The head chef is going to want this fish.
[247:24.28]What are your sisters up to these days, Meg?
[247:26.32]I've not seen them around.
[247:30.34]I have no idea what you just said.
[247:33.65]I wasn't looking.
[247:34.15]All I heard was, I swear to God, this is what I just heard.
[247:42.45]I didn't hear anything else.
[247:49.02]I didn't hear.
[247:49.56]I couldn't understand anything.
[247:54.61]Cooking's one way to pass the time.
[247:56.11]I love this voice, though.
[247:57.31]Whoever this voice actress is, fucking great job.
[247:59.75]Good.
[248:00.41]Very good.
[248:02.29]This is my latest hole.
[248:05.01]Oh, 20.
[248:09.38]They're all good.
[248:10.68]It's actually kind of rare that you get a game that actually has good voice acting.
[248:16.22]...intoxicating vintage they contain, and fewer still are permitted anywhere near their vicinity.
[248:25.66]Still waiting for the festive occasion when we'll open one of these.
[248:31.26]Main character too, Zagros.
[248:34.30]Very collected.
[248:35.50]It's not over the top.
[248:36.58]It's just subtle enough and it's just interesting enough.
[248:39.24]And he did a great job.
[248:40.46]Actually, perfect job.
[248:47.56]What's new?
[248:49.38]Two keys for 20 gems.
[248:50.52]No thanks.
[248:51.00]Wait, how much is it?
[248:51.84]Can I get a key?
[248:54.79]uh is this like is this a psycho thing to do if I buy four keys right now it's a deal you could always use more keys I don't care uh so what did the what did the fish do
[249:23.68]Oh, the gems, right.
[249:25.03]Okay.
[249:27.35]Let's unlock the gloves.
[249:31.55]But first.
[249:31.97]Hmm.
[249:43.96]Hmm.
[249:44.95]Hmm.
[250:00.19]I like that better.
[250:00.87]I really do.
[250:01.27]Let's just save the keys.
[250:05.09]Get Death Defiance 2.
[250:12.99]I need 600, uh, lopules.
[250:21.16]Maybe like this.
[250:30.46]Oh, I just get the weapon.
[250:31.20]I just got 5,000 bits.
[250:35.74]50 bucks.
[250:35.94]From Freakout.
[250:36.36]Says, you missed my bits earlier, daddy.
[250:38.10]Daddy.
[250:56.37]I don't know if you've been here for a while, but I no longer read bits during the stream or after the stream.
[251:01.51]Bits are done.
[251:02.95]Unless, of course, you give like that.
[251:05.45]Pretty much, it's all done.
[251:07.59]I don't know what you're talking about.
[251:13.34]3D bastard.
[251:14.08]And you know what?
[251:17.08]I think it's time.
[251:18.22]I think it's time for me to say this now, too.
[251:22.32]I think from here going out,
[251:25.89]I don't think I'm not going to read bits anymore.
[251:29.59]I think it's fair that way.
[251:35.50]I think it's fair.
[251:36.02]Because when I stopped doing that at the end of the stream bits...
[251:42.82]the intention was for you know I wanted to be able to spend more time streaming and not time you know at the end of the stream if I have to sit here for an extra you know if I'm sitting here for four or five six hours and I have to get up uh and there's like an hour and a half of bits that's the the first part right but the second part is I don't want people to think they have to give more money now for me to read their message I'd rather just say it's over completely
[252:14.74]Because that puts a sort of dumb precedent in place for people to say, well, he doesn't read anything that's 200 bits.
[252:22.55]I just give 5,000, he'll read it.
[252:25.67]So, I don't like that precedent.
[252:33.24]Just raise it to 200.
[252:41.62]No.
[252:42.58]Like I said previously, I said like a week or two ago,
[252:46.25]If you want to support this stream, and you like what you see here, and you like this community, and you want to subscribe to the channel, do that.
[252:57.66]Nobody, at this point going forward, should be giving me $50 to $100 in one drop.
[253:09.97]And people say, dude, I've been watching you for years, like, let me give you $50 to $100 right now, right?
[253:18.24]But that's not necessary.
[253:20.50]You don't have to do that.
[253:21.88]In fact, I don't want you to do that.
[253:31.17]I've seen that message plenty of times.
[253:32.67]But this community subs, right?
[253:33.77]It's like, what about community subs?
[253:36.03]I think community subs is a little different just because it, well, well.
[253:42.60]Just completely going just against everything I was just saying.
[253:45.50]That's funny.
[253:47.28]But anyways.
[253:49.80]first of all let me let me alright let me get through this first community subs are a little different just because when you give a community sub somebody that you're giving somebody access to the emotes and the no ads that I wait that doesn't that's not even real anymore is it you're giving them the sub they can use the emotes and they can you know sub only mode that's available right
[254:16.16]So you get those perks.
[254:17.46]You're giving those perks to somebody.
[254:19.68]So it's not just me that just gets, you know, money and that's it.
[254:23.06]When you give the community subs, you're giving somebody that might not be able to potentially afford to pay $5 a month that, hey, you can use the emotes.
[254:35.90]So rather than just be accepting 500, you know, 1,000, 550 bucks, 100 bucks, 200 bucks from one person.
[254:45.94]Uh, I just, I think it's more fair that way.
[254:52.88]Just admit it's because you can't read.
[254:54.24]It's been an elaborate scheme this whole time.
[254:59.04]Give us more stuff to use channel points on.
[255:01.90]I want to turn on that, like, gambling thing.
[255:04.36]Like, the predict thing.
[255:05.30]I don't have access to that.
[255:07.06]I wish I did, but I don't have, I don't think I have access to it.
[255:09.92]I looked in my thing.
[255:10.66]I don't have it.
[255:19.51]They won't give it to me.
[255:21.85]Alright, let's open it.
[255:22.67]I don't care.
[255:23.17]What is it?
[255:24.11]That's what I saved it up for.
[255:24.99]Old?
[255:25.07]A rising cutter?
[255:26.09]Dash strike.
[255:26.51]Dash uppercut.
[255:51.14]It's a monk build.
[255:53.66]So there is no... Alright, that's gonna be weird.
[256:01.18]Uh... I'll give him a try.
[256:03.89]I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked, but... Let's go over these subs just really quickly, because it was a lot.
[256:09.13]Pattycake gave 20 community subs, which is a ton of money.
[256:12.23]That is more than I even said to not give.
[256:15.31]Right?
[256:16.81]Thanks for the huge amount of money.
[256:18.59]And the community subs.
[256:20.17]Labster, 5 community subs.
[256:21.73]Nondescript Civilian, 25 community subs.
[256:23.79]Which is a shitload of money.
[256:26.58]Litigation, thanks for 5 subs.
[256:28.04]And Destroy, thanks for 5 subs.
[256:29.80]Destroy, dude.
[256:41.37]You can play with Boppities in this game.
[256:42.91]Go left, it's a secret area.
[256:48.96]But he's still reading them.
[256:51.06]Well, community subs, I... I feel like acknowledging community subs is like, oh, look, some of you got subs.
[257:00.51]I don't know.
[257:01.07]What do you think?
[257:03.95]But then that brings in the, wait, but I could just give a bunch of money if I give a shitload of subs, right?
[257:10.57]Yeah, I don't know.
[257:11.23]I just don't want people to think they have to give an absolute shitload of money to get me to read it when that was not the intention in the first place.
[257:19.82]Just acknowledge nothing.
[257:21.12]Just harvest money.
[257:22.20]I'll try the fists.
[257:28.75]I feel like this is boring.
[257:31.92]Not the fists.
[257:33.80]Like what I've been doing.
[257:34.68]Just the meta of take coin purse, replace with tooth.
[257:40.10]I feel like I... Is this boring?
[257:49.41]Just 25 health.
[257:51.83]But they're not... But this upgrades.
[257:53.31]If I use this enough, this is okay.
[257:55.87]Does this eventually get up to 75 health?
[258:03.22]That's a huge deal.
[258:04.06]50.
[258:04.85]That's a big deal.
[258:18.98]Level up all your trinkets.
[258:19.94]It will add variety and you will understand what you want from it.
[258:23.22]Yeah, you know what?
[258:44.87]Let's try these.
[258:51.68]But I'll try those after.
[258:57.14]I put on... I want the money.
[259:02.04]Ready as I'll ever be.
[259:06.37]It's all about the money.
[259:07.79]It's a good start.
[259:12.33]Time to mix up my style.
[259:13.85]Your attack becomes a three-hit sequence, and each deals 40 base damage.
[259:19.94]Huh.
[259:22.12]You are sturdy while you use your attack.
[259:26.50]You take 30% less damage.
[259:27.78]Your actions cannot be interrupted.
[259:32.76]Oh, three is really good, too.
[259:34.18]Three is insane.
[259:35.14]That just breaks any armor instantly.
[259:51.28]They seem like they're kind of fun, but the holding down X thing is probably going to mess me up.
[260:04.15]I feel like Little Mac when I have these on.
[260:13.87]I love the dash uppercut.
[260:14.87]It's awesome.
[260:18.60]Try getting Artemis.
[260:20.06]The fast firing is awesome.
[260:21.40]Yeah, that's true.
[260:23.41]But what about Zeus?
[260:24.25]Zeus like the chain lightning going chain, chain, chain, chain, chain, chain.
[260:41.31]So now I understand why... Okay, oh, you beat the game!
[260:45.19]No, it's not even what I'm doing.
[260:48.38]That's like saying that if you beat Mom's foot, then you win Binding of Isaac.
[260:52.36]That's five more subs.
[260:53.28]Whoops.
[260:54.00]Oh well.
[260:58.17]How many do I owe?
[260:58.65]Uh, 25?
[260:58.73]Alright, I gotta shut up.
[261:11.71]Alright.
[261:12.91]Let's get something good.
[261:14.15]Why do I owe subs?
[261:15.41]Uh, because I... I signed a contract yesterday when I first started playing the game.
[261:20.27]That... I would not reference... Binding of Isaac, World of Warcraft...
[261:38.99]Dark Souls, and I forget the last game.
[261:41.05]I seriously don't know what it was.
[261:42.75]I forget what it was.
[261:43.43]What was the fourth one?
[261:48.37]Hearthstone.
[261:49.21]Right, right.
[261:50.35]So if I've referenced those... No, that's not fair.
[261:54.36]We're in a timeout right now.
[261:55.46]This is a pause.
[261:56.22]I'm... No, that's not what this is.
[261:59.48]We are not referencing that in the game.
[262:02.10]We are referencing the fact that that was what the con... I'm stating what the contract is.
[262:11.49]So, and the person that just asked that, they'd be probably like, what the, who fucking cares?
[262:15.27]Like, what are you talking about?
[262:17.35]I have a tendency on this stream to always call back to those four games all the time, like every stream.
[262:27.19]So I'm trying to give myself a, trying to get me away from it.
[262:39.88]Your special causes a lightning bolt to strike nearby foes.
[262:42.82]That looks pretty good.
[262:49.00]Your dash causes a lightning bolt to... Ah, that's actually good too.
[262:51.38]I like this one.
[262:59.23]Ooh, alright.
[263:00.45]Water or fire.
[263:02.01]How about Poseidon?
[263:17.45]Pretty good uppercut.
[263:24.96]There's a pretty heavy reach on this thing too.
[263:38.70]Do you know why I like this game so much and why I'm very into playing this game?
[263:43.76]It's mainly because it has actually been a very long time since a game like this has come out that I've actually enjoyed playing.
[263:56.86]This rogue-like items and upgrades room to room, it's been a while.
[264:01.94]If she troubles you again, you just remind her who's in charge down there.
[264:08.28]No, not any video game.
[264:09.52]I'm just saying, just in general.
[264:11.50]Like, the genre.
[264:12.64]It's been a while since the genre has had a game like this that I enjoy.
[264:19.49]That's good.
[264:24.83]Well, I need a dash.
[264:25.73]This is just safety.
[264:37.52]Fish.
[264:39.02]Play Transistor.
[264:39.96]It's even better.
[264:40.96]I was told that Transistor is not like this.
[264:49.58]Is that correct?
[264:58.64]Did that shield break?
[264:59.50]Transistor is not like this, but it's still very good.
[265:06.04]I know you're out there, Fish.
[265:11.68]A Cilacision.
[265:13.74]Cilacision, that's what I said.
[265:20.95]Next boon you find has an upgraded rarity.
[265:22.87]I like that.
[265:28.13]Oops.
[265:38.04]Well, we're getting the key.
[265:42.52]That one took you 50 tries?
[265:44.06]Is that good?
[265:53.16]That break.
[265:56.98]This game's good.
[265:57.95]It's very good.
[265:59.29]Hey, remember when I took a point off?
[266:00.91]Maybe I went at a 91.
[266:03.49]Oh, the point came back.
[266:04.35]+2 keys.
[266:19.62]Is this better fish?
[266:20.44]Oh, that's cool.
[266:30.36]This is cool.
[266:38.85]You just absolutely shred people with the armor crusher.
[266:48.01]um I did after daddy last time and it didn't work out that's look at that red
[267:29.37]nice 250 damage that's pretty good
[267:36.64]I see the urn.
[267:38.56]Oh, I want to play this again.
[267:44.90]I don't think I'm going to beat it tonight.
[267:48.10]But I'm going to play.
[267:49.30]Here we go.
[267:49.71]Here you go.
[267:50.01]You ready?
[267:50.99]Here's the plan.
[267:51.43]The plan is tomorrow we're going to change it up.
[267:55.65]Tomorrow's chat's choice.
[267:57.89]I'm not done tonight.
[267:58.57]I'm just saying.
[267:59.65]Tomorrow's chat's choice.
[268:01.21]So pre-stream chat tomorrow like an hour before the stream.
[268:03.59]Somewhere around like 2 o'clock or so.
[268:04.70]1 to 2 o'clock.
[268:06.48]We will play something else.
[268:09.14]Then, after Chat's choice tomorrow, we're going to go back to this, and I'm going to play this again.
[268:23.75]Because I'm into it.
[268:25.34]And it's been a pretty long time since I've been into a game like this, so I'm playing it.
[268:31.46]He's addicted.
[268:31.94]Yes, I am.
[268:33.44]Alright, should I get the caster?
[268:45.95]Oh, that one.
[268:46.89]Heartbreak time.
[268:49.89]And keys.
[268:54.27]He doesn't like Noita?
[268:56.18]No, I just, I'm not, I, it couldn't, it didn't click with me.
[269:01.86]Just skill-based-wise, I was like, um, may as well just put a, I've had a paper bag on my head that whole time.
[269:09.60]That Terraria-style mouse kind of aiming keyboard side-scrolling, I'm not very good at it.
[269:16.51]Did I just get hit?
[269:28.41]Is there an urn here?
[269:28.93]There is.
[269:37.88]This game feels, like, right up my alley.
[269:39.98]I just, I like playing it.
[269:41.23]That's not to say I didn't like playing, uh, Noito.
[269:49.64]Just, this is much more in my wheelhouse of video games that I like to play.
[269:54.57]only got two gigs of ram that's punch yeah punch is like 200 megabytes dash is probably a thousand megabytes because you need to get that correctly and then special is 200 megabytes and then move don't get hit by stuff is another probably 800 megabytes if I may be so bold your highness I was wondering what brings you back around this way again same story as last time
[270:25.66]Out of space.
[270:29.30]Look, I have to level with you, Sisyphus.
[270:32.00]I'm leaving the house.
[270:33.44]I've had quite enough.
[270:35.04]You understand, I'm sure.
[270:36.73]I'm going to the surface.
[270:37.61]Data leak.
[270:38.23]Yeah, there's like some kind of acid leaking out of the motherboard.
[270:42.19]If it wasn't you yourself proposing it, I'd like to call it madness, truth be told.
[270:46.37]Though, you're just mad enough to pull it off.
[270:48.95]Well, hey, I hope you make it.
[270:51.00]Good fortune out there.
[270:56.68]Okay.
[270:59.88]That's not... Give me the money.
[271:02.48]Or no.
[271:05.60]Yeah, give me the money.
[271:08.37]Do I have any... Can I gift you?
[271:22.58]That's it.
[271:23.34]Let it all come out.
[271:25.95]I don't have any nectar.
[271:27.07]Oh, that's too bad.
[271:28.03]Survive for 45 seconds.
[271:29.27]That move is so good.
[271:30.27]I can upgrade that move too.
[271:31.17]That's the best part.
[272:06.52]Lightning.
[272:06.98]Lightning.
[272:08.14]Lightning.
[272:12.56]We made it.
[272:19.28]5, 4, 3, 2, 1.
[272:21.88]Kill them.
[272:23.58]That's enough.
[272:25.26]Peace and quiet.
[272:28.54]Quick, quick, quick, quick, quick.
[272:32.21]What is that?
[272:34.81]Is that a lizard?
[272:35.89]That's a lizard.
[272:47.46]That's a pretty cool lizard.
[272:53.14]Wait, what day is it today?
[272:57.52]This is... This is... October?
[272:59.82]Oh.
[273:00.36]No, it's November.
[273:01.16]Oh.
[273:03.04]Oh, shit.
[273:03.50]Look at this.
[273:09.95]Lizard of days past.
[273:11.57]That's good.
[273:19.03]That's a cool lizard.
[273:22.85]Or a gecko.
[273:23.52]Oh.
[273:27.32]That's just level two.
[273:28.55]Probably three.
[273:31.01]Three or one.
[273:42.28]Two?
[273:42.50]Three is more damage than all of them.
[273:47.40]Oh, I guess because it's a double, right?
[273:48.86]I forgot I can dash twice.
[273:56.25]Am I interrupting something?
[274:04.15]So far so good.
[274:05.23]Let's just hope it scales.
[274:15.33]That's life.
[274:16.66]I should play Gex tomorrow.
[274:17.58]I played Gex already and it was dog shit.
[274:20.03]Oops.
[274:20.51]I should... Alright, you can tell I have a little... It was okay.
[274:24.35]It was good.
[274:25.41]It was good.
[274:25.83]It was good.
[274:26.85]It was good.
[274:27.43]Whatever.
[274:27.67]He's high?
[274:28.31]No, I'm not.
[274:49.34]Well, I can get it all.
[274:50.57]Take it all.
[274:52.57]Aphrodite.
[274:54.39]Aphrodite.
[274:56.71]I want to give you more gifts.
[274:57.97]I want... You can be... Is this romance in this game?
[275:00.09]That's good.
[275:00.43]Wait, Aphrodite's call...
[275:19.37]Your call fire is a seeking projectile that inflicts charm.
[275:22.21]For a short time, the victim fights for you with greater strength and speed.
[275:28.43]Oh.
[275:31.71]This thing does 2,500 damage?
[275:32.27]Does it work on bosses?
[275:32.83]It does.
[275:49.09]This is almost too good to ignore though.
[275:54.80]But I'm going to make the wrong call and I'm going to get the call.
[275:56.58]Damage is only if it's max.
[276:03.20]Yeah, but how much more strength and damage do they do?
[276:05.48]It says when they're charmed they do more damage, right?
[276:25.84]shitload after using call gain dodge chance dodge chance and move speed after you dash briefly become sturdy and move 100 faster yeah it's that one
[276:54.96]It's not very long though, is it?
[276:56.16]Alright, let's go kill Meg for like a thousandth time.
[277:09.95]She's different.
[277:14.72]What is this?
[277:18.72]Hey, you must be one of Meg's sisters.
[277:20.58]Nice to finally meet you.
[277:22.08]My name is Agrius.
[277:23.60]Not murderer.
[277:24.61]Definitely not.
[277:27.73]Murderer.
[277:29.71]Murderer.
[277:30.89]This is Kissyphone.
[277:33.89]I'm Meg anymore?
[277:34.55]Um, look, I've done some things... Is it because I killed Meg too many times?
[277:39.09]I am very, very sure I haven't murdered anyone.
[277:51.81]Alright, well, let's go.
[277:54.47]They have a new move set too.
[277:55.55]Is it poison?
[278:04.80]Looks like poison.
[278:06.50]Is there poison cure here?
[278:13.34]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[278:17.21]Ow.
[278:17.63]Why do I have hard Meg?
[278:19.11]I don't want to fight hard Meg.
[278:20.73]I want the easy Meg that I kill easily.
[278:22.69]Now she's my friend.
[278:44.03]Oh.
[278:45.53]We have a new moveset.
[278:46.57]This is not fair.
[278:47.43]I don't know what the hell.
[278:57.78]What?
[279:00.14]What the hell is going on?
[279:09.55]Beat her up while she's charmed.
[279:10.39]Ow.
[279:26.77]It kind of works.
[279:42.08]Hello?
[279:42.40]Where'd you go?
[279:43.40]Oh, there you are.
[279:53.50]Oh, fuck you, tissy phone.
[280:03.70]What the fuck?
[280:04.97]What the hell is going on here?
[280:06.39]This is such a shitty area to fight somebody.
[280:26.89]Why are you so much harder than the other one?
[280:30.61]What?
[280:31.23]I'm dead?
[280:31.69]Well, that was unexpected.
[280:42.76]That was disturbing.
[280:52.89]Tisiphony.
[280:56.14]Whatever.
[280:56.88]Can't beat Tisiphone.
[280:57.86]Aww.
[281:19.89]This is where I pick grenade up, put grenade in my mouth, and just lob it over there and just go like this.
[281:33.34]New stuff, hold on.
[281:35.84]Authorizes playback of music pieces from the vault.
[281:42.60]Now, if only Twitch would do this, that would be great.
[281:51.62]This ought to help Orpheus keep his boundless libraries of music in order.
[281:54.98]Just have to fill it in.
[281:56.96]Our court musician need not be so indulged.
[282:02.20]Oh, so what does it do?
[282:04.48]You are home.
[282:05.56]Listen.
[282:06.91]Some new music.
[282:07.61]Did I just spend a diamond on the sound test options menu?
[282:23.78]Why do I only have two?
[282:24.50]We can buy the rest for more diamonds.
[282:27.70]Well.
[282:27.90]There's your endgame, Sync.
[282:53.77]I can't imagine him otherwise.
[282:58.57]Anything new in here?
[282:59.61]Yes, there is.
[283:00.21]What do you got?
[283:02.07]Here's what I caught.
[283:02.67]30 bucks.
[283:05.55]I think that's worth 100.
[283:08.29]What's this stuff?
[283:15.30]How many keys do I have?
[283:15.96]Okay, I need to buy.
[283:32.38]Chambers may contain 10 gold.
[283:34.62]What a waste of 60 gems, unless that's the final thing you ever upgrade.
[283:37.85]I need keys.
[283:50.93]Too good to pass up.
[283:56.63]Somebody said you need to feed her some Bugsnax.
[284:00.91]Get out of here.
[284:02.39]Go back to Undertale Temmie.
[284:43.85]I just almost ended my stream
[285:27.52]I need four more keys.
[285:33.05]Achilles or Riot.
[285:34.45]Achilles or Riot.
[285:35.15]I don't know where he is.
[285:35.93]Where's Achilles?
[285:36.91]Where is he?
[285:37.41]He's not in his usual hiding place.
[285:41.73]Achilles, or we Trojan horse you.
[286:10.30]So you're all going to deliver a horsey to my house and go in it?
[286:16.36]And then I'm going to open the door and you guys are going to all come in and murder me?
[286:22.73]Okay.
[286:23.93]Well, I'm here.
[286:28.69]I'm talking to Achilles.
[286:34.07]Ow, I'm sorry.
[286:36.87]Alright, Achilles or Riot.
[286:39.81]We did it.
[286:42.09]Talk to dad.
[286:54.79]So tell me something, father, if you please, since we're more candid lately in regard to matters of my birthright here and all.
[287:00.82]Did you and mother, how to put this, any brothers or sisters I should know about?
[287:07.50]I was like a ace attorney.
[287:08.20]I almost said attorney's law.
[287:31.77]There's all these expensive gems and stuff down here.
[288:00.98]But what do you buy with it?
[288:04.49]This is one weird ghost to trade.
[288:09.35]What do you even buy with this stuff?
[288:10.65]Look at all these gems and jewels.
[288:16.65]I mean, there's no Denny's here.
[288:17.87]There's no mall.
[288:21.76]What are you supposed to do with this money?
[288:30.16]Hanging for the Denny's breakfast combo with gems Yeah, what else are you gonna do with this stuff?
[288:43.79]He's wearing it all over him And money doesn't really have value anymore guys when you have a belt
[288:51.58]the belt buckle is a golden jeweled skull and inside of the skull's mouth is other skull jeweled rubies and stuff he's wearing a championship belt of money he doesn't what do you think he cares about gems anymore I appreciate the vote of confidence mate maybe you're right and someday I'll get out of here hey if I never come back you won't just be stuck here forever will you
[289:17.31]And that's a good one.
[289:18.53]No, probably not.
[289:19.95]It's for decoration.
[289:20.99]Wasn't anything in the old contract about that.
[289:29.40]Hey, look at that.
[289:30.30]Ooh!
[289:31.80]This is a gun.
[289:35.44]That's a Falco gun.
[289:36.74]What is that?
[289:39.48]It's eight.
[289:41.52]I need to get it right now.
[289:42.89]I want it now.
[289:45.79]Let's see here.
[289:52.74]Oh, right, I died because I threw at the end there.
[289:55.22]Alright, I'm going to keep the purse on.
[289:57.50]But, we're going... Bow time.
[290:22.06]My first win was with the gun.
[290:30.99]That works.
[290:32.91]That works.
[290:37.57]What is explosive shot?
[290:42.19]It takes such a long time.
[290:53.25]Does the explosion hurt me?
[290:55.05]Let's find out.
[290:57.96]It doesn't.
[290:58.36]Okay.
[290:58.86]I gotta get that timing right.
[291:10.55]300% damage is insane.
[291:11.65]Yeah.
[291:11.83]I don't care how long it takes.
[291:21.04]The bosses, though, this... Uh-oh.
[291:23.64]This might not be very good.
[291:32.08]If I get chaos with this, then... Somebody said chaos?
[291:34.99]Alright, this is important.
[291:40.19]This is really important.
[291:44.41]If I can get this to be insane.
[291:47.97]This could be huge.
[291:53.49]I just looked over at the image.
[291:54.43]All your attacks lose 50% damage, but you get a slice of baloney.
[291:57.79]It's just still on my other monitor.
[292:25.85]I mean, it's one.
[292:31.19]Can't earn money?
[292:31.85]Who cares?
[292:32.41]This is the run.
[292:40.88]Don't throw.
[292:42.60]I'm going to try.
[292:56.37]Don't need a full charge.
[292:57.35]That's important to understand here.
[292:58.59]Full charge is not even necessary.
[293:02.57]Just land it. ...
[293:26.64]200.
[293:32.26]I love the charge sound.
[293:34.13]I like... Good.
[293:52.40]I got hurt?
[293:52.94]What did I get hurt by?
[293:57.33]I don't have enough to... Wait.
[294:00.03]I can get the health upgrade.
[294:01.34]Wait, is it the chaos?
[294:03.10]Did I miss the chaos?
[294:04.86]Shut up.
[294:05.88]No, I didn't.
[294:06.66]Did I?
[294:06.98]No.
[294:11.12]Oh, my God.
[294:12.32]You scared me so much.
[294:14.08]Oh, my chest is on fire.
[294:17.67]Lucky find.
[294:30.95]Guys, I don't understand.
[294:32.41]I don't know what's happening to me.
[294:39.48]Stop it.
[294:40.00]I gotta relax.
[294:41.52]Thank you.
[294:57.86]This is really awesome.
[295:00.07]Just need a ton more damage on this.
[295:01.65]This will be unbeatable.
[295:12.16]The timing is a little weird, though.
[295:13.52]Oh, come on, really?
[295:17.80]A curse of chaos has expired.
[295:19.28]Hey, Artemis of the Blue.
[295:25.61]You're of the green in this game, but thank you for the five subs.
[295:29.23]Okay, your special is Hangover, which I like.
[295:41.02]Because I can just kind of fan that.
[295:44.95]The cast lobs a large explosive that bursts into festive fog.
[295:49.95]This is just a stun.
[295:52.29]Yeah, let me try that.
[295:53.73]To my health.
[295:56.25]It's a very long cast.
[295:58.29]It hurts me.
[295:58.70]Okay, no it doesn't.
[296:00.44]You can aim it.
[296:08.36]Okay, that's not bad.
[296:11.02]And when they're stunned, I can blow them up.
[296:13.30]That's great.
[296:14.56]That works out pretty well.
[296:16.88]More health.
[296:17.18]Perfect.
[296:27.44]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[296:28.52]Any fish?
[296:28.92]I do not see fish.
[296:41.42]Let's go lads.
[296:59.04]That actually works really... Not... It's alright.
[297:14.08]Oh, yeah.
[297:14.49]The bow is great.
[297:15.19]Bow and shield are my favorites.
[297:20.47]Not enough.
[297:24.55]to beat her to beat her boons puke so this is a good combo here because
[297:55.34]I can do that and the stun and then blow them all up.
[298:05.33]So it's like you go wham, wham, boom.
[298:15.58]Or you go wham, wham, boom.
[298:25.15]I just watched a TikTok of somebody making soap.
[298:28.93]Probably cool.
[298:29.73]I don't know.
[298:31.97]The ACDC Freak gave five subs.
[298:33.55]Thank you, ACDC Freak.
[298:34.57]Didn't they just come up with a new album?
[298:38.64]Didn't ACDC just release a new album?
[298:48.58]And it's good.
[298:50.00]And don't they sound exactly the same, too?
[298:55.04]They haven't changed at all.
[298:55.86]How do they still sound the same?
[299:03.27]Aren't they 80?
[299:04.05]Pretty good.
[299:43.68]It's very good.
[299:47.40]There's a chest in here too, don't let me forget that.
[300:03.50]Ten.
[300:07.90]Okay.
[300:10.65]This chest is for up to a hundred gold.
[300:14.67]Just combo the hell out of him.
[300:17.16]Slay foes quickly.
[300:40.95]I could have killed them that much faster than that.
[300:42.43]Who's going to clean all this up?
[300:45.63]I'll take it.
[300:48.73]You have to have an insane build to be able to kill things in a second.
[300:55.39]Miss anything?
[300:55.77]Me, me, me.
[301:01.55]What are you doing?
[301:03.11]Oh, God.
[301:04.27]That is far enough.
[301:10.18]I have the explosive, I'm good.
[301:32.78]Just keep him on that bridge.
[301:44.17]Oh shit, watch out.
[301:47.87]Oh, right at the end, really.
[301:48.90]That's a good strategy too.
[301:59.45]Did I get to the final boss yet?
[302:00.69]Yes, a couple of times.
[302:04.22]I've gotten the final... Well, I don't know if it's final boss, but I've gotten the... I got the final boss of the story mode or whatever.
[302:12.70]Down to the second phase.
[302:17.34]One more key gets me a gun.
[302:19.04]It does.
[302:21.54]Hmm.
[302:27.52]I want that.
[302:37.84]300 damage.
[302:39.64]Ringers?
[302:42.60]Oh, shit.
[302:43.50]I thought I had a different move.
[302:44.74]What is it hitting?
[303:04.03]Where's the treasure trove?
[303:06.70]Didn't it say the treasure trove was going to spawn?
[303:08.08]I don't see a treasure.
[303:10.52]Oh, I do.
[303:10.90]100 gold.
[303:12.82]Let's go.
[303:14.00]Give me a good spawn.
[303:16.15]Die!
[303:38.52]71 help yourself mine what did I just get like 20 gold return 21 gold return and I lost five health or something not worth it
[304:09.30]Udash shoots a gust.
[304:11.82]10 stacks of chill cause a blast, clearing the effect.
[304:16.16]While all foes are chilled.
[304:23.97]They are 10% slower and decayed.
[304:28.67]K damage.
[304:30.31]So I just... They all get chilled anyways.
[304:34.33]Sounds good.
[304:35.80]Ah.
[304:38.84]It just adds to the potential.
[304:44.88]Alright, am I going to get the harder Meg?
[304:50.36]Again?
[304:53.21]Damn.
[305:03.59]Wait, this is a different Meg.
[305:04.99]How many Megs are there?
[305:06.11]Somebody wrote... Somebody said, step on me.
[305:07.99]Ha ha ha.
[305:08.57]Ha ha ha.
[305:33.80]Anyway, I always wanted to kill a god.
[305:36.88]You don't have to do.
[305:41.70]That's the first thing you write.
[305:42.86]It's just... Oh, who's this new god?
[305:47.42]Who's this new character?
[305:48.30]Oh, I don't know.
[305:48.90]Step on me.
[305:58.32]What's this rage?
[305:59.52]She's gonna rage meet her?
[306:06.14]What exactly does that mean?
[306:07.26]Oops.
[306:18.83]Well, you're not nearly as bad as the other one.
[306:20.59]Can we stop her from doing that?
[306:40.76]She's impervious.
[306:48.26]Dude, these traps have blended in with the ground with the same c- I've only taken damage from the fucking traps on the ground!
[307:16.04]I was stepping on the area that was... I was avoiding the actual ground.
[307:20.86]I got plenty of health.
[307:31.53]I'm fine.
[307:33.45]Good build.
[307:33.85]They're going to step on me.
[307:53.34]Can I ask to guess what element I was?
[307:56.02]What element am I?
[307:56.70]I know what animal I am.
[307:59.82]One of those fucking parrots that you see at the pet store.
[308:06.32]Not even the cool one.
[308:10.72]The one that just yells out the thing that you just said.
[308:21.29]Like a parakeet.
[308:25.37]Yeah, it makes sense, right?
[308:28.44]Look at half of my mannerisms.
[308:29.80]Just like... Just say the shit that you're writing.
[308:32.70]Figured it out.
[308:54.86]Alright, it's time to change to... I feel like this is a good run though.
[308:59.52]The meta is too good.
[309:01.26]The run is too good.
[309:03.56]I can't change it.
[309:06.55]Stop hating yourself.
[309:07.33]I don't hate myself.
[309:08.01]Parrots are incredibly intelligent.
[309:09.15]They're really cool and they're really fun.
[309:11.87]I didn't say parrots were stupid or bad.
[309:25.46]I'm keeping the tooth on.
[309:26.42]This runs good.
[309:28.12]If it's going to happen tonight, it's going to happen right now.
[309:39.72]What?
[309:41.57]Why is it locked?
[309:43.93]Let me back in there.
[309:45.15]Let me back in there.
[309:45.73]Let me back in there.
[309:47.55]They lock it after you equip something?
[309:52.81]Aww.
[309:53.87]That's unfortunate.
[310:02.69]I will.
[310:08.73]What up, my fellow germites?
[310:10.37]You forgot to add the A. It's Jermamites.
[310:16.16]So you can't just get free money from the purse.
[310:18.30]That makes sense.
[310:18.82]I'm going to grind it.
[310:35.31]All my granite.
[310:50.04]It's a good build.
[310:51.51]And I got good health, too.
[310:52.55]This is gonna work out pretty well, I think.
[311:07.96]What do we got?
[311:09.02]Your special is stronger and does chill.
[311:10.88]Your cast lobs a large explosive that bursts into festive fog.
[311:15.49]Which one?
[311:17.73]One or two.
[311:18.37]One or two.
[311:19.03]They're both good.
[311:22.29]Although this is probably better.
[311:25.97]Pretty good lobs lob.
[311:36.02]Can I interact with this?
[311:40.56]Hmm, money or Poseidon.
[311:43.80]Probably Poseidon.
[311:46.74]And we're off.
[311:53.87]Surprise.
[311:58.29]Get away from me.
[312:00.73]Get away.
[312:05.61]Get away.
[312:17.32]Good.
[312:18.30]It's working out pretty well.
[312:20.66]Dad, I'm coming for you.
[312:21.80]Attack deals more damage and knocks people away.
[312:25.34]That's just great.
[312:25.82]Here is... That's good too, though.
[312:48.59]It's more insane explosive damage or have a call that makes me invincible.
[312:59.09]Or just a huge amount of rewards.
[313:01.23]These are all good.
[313:02.07]I don't know what to do.
[313:12.28]Uh...
[313:19.59]I'm taking the call.
[313:24.79]Too early?
[313:31.35]How was that too early?
[313:35.42]Just bobbed and I hit... That was late, if anything.
[313:38.70]How was it too early?
[314:10.05]You guys are jumpy!
[314:21.55]Bow is best.
[314:22.33]Bow and shield.
[314:22.97]I like bow better than shield.
[314:25.69]I know I change my mind every single run, but I mean, I love the bow.
[314:29.54]It just does it for me.
[314:48.70]Perfect!
[314:55.48]Cat, every weapon is good.
[314:56.34]You're bad.
[314:56.82]Uh-oh, arguments.
[314:59.14]Fighting in the chatroom.
[315:10.87]That's not a bad trade.
[315:13.29]I'll just take... That's a... That's nothing.
[315:15.73]For 10 gems?
[315:23.93]I know people are going to say, look, I couldn't have bought it, I couldn't have afforded it.
[315:28.37]After day.
[315:32.24]Time for the chat bar fight.
[315:37.88]You will not do so.
[316:05.29]Don't crush me.
[316:08.83]Where am I?
[316:10.81]Fine.
[316:14.01]I just stopped freaking out.
[316:23.09]Is he going to the lava?
[316:24.32]What happened?
[316:29.26]I kind of want to give Aphrodite another gift.
[316:30.98]I'm going to do it.
[316:39.24]My lady Aphrodite, if not for our acquaintance, I'm certain that my days or nights would be much drearier indeed.
[316:48.20]Why, dearest, such a wonderfully thoughtful gift for me.
[316:52.08]I love it and I would be lying.
[316:53.74]Romancing Aphrodite.
[316:58.82]I got a. Oh, another one.
[317:04.12]Wait, how much more stuff do you want? 123.
[317:09.39]four more hearts and then you talk two more hearts and you'll talk to me again what you know how hard these are to get you're going to love it on olympus little godling the air is beautiful and brisk the gardens lush the feasting plentiful why it must be the opposite of everything to which you are accustomed
[317:38.53]That's not bad.
[317:43.20]I mean, that's just 13%.
[317:45.04]Why not just do it?
[317:46.80]Revenge damage is good too.
[317:53.59]Do it.
[317:56.37]Pomegranate time.
[317:57.21]Grow up, Jerma.
[318:04.49]I'm, what, I'm pretending to romance a woman in a video game that has, like, a romance feature?
[318:10.00]I'm just playing the video game.
[318:11.94]This is the intended feature of the video game.
[318:13.58]Okay, by that it wasn't looking...
[318:40.95]Get over here.
[318:41.46]Into the water with you.
[318:49.69]Oh shit.
[318:52.41]I need Medusa heads.
[319:08.43]shit wasn't fast enough what's going on my screen you see that it's weird what what's going on my screen it's like going black for a second it's like dipping black dipping black dipping black it's a smoke effect oh
[319:37.59]power of Olympus even more damage from the fog super call or a 16% reduction in all damage yeah it's between these two I think
[320:14.65]I, yeah.
[320:15.75]I gotta get better at hitting it though.
[320:19.65]Ooh, Aphrodite and Dionysus.
[320:21.59]Or Pomegranate.
[320:22.09]Yeah, we're going here.
[320:22.99]We want upgrades.
[320:28.15]Cast ignores armor.
[320:29.11]Yeah, that's good too.
[320:32.56]Yeah, man.
[320:33.20]You know what it's all about.
[320:43.74]Using a fountain restores all your health and gives you bonus damage per fountain.
[320:48.49]That's good stuff.
[320:52.25]My dear Aphrodite.
[320:53.69]I'm so sorry, my queen.
[320:54.15]I'm so sorry.
[320:54.93]I'll never do it again, I swear.
[321:35.51]Get away from me.
[321:36.09]Stop doing the hearts thing.
[321:41.09]Get away.
[321:53.90]Get out of here.
[321:54.49]Into the fire.
[322:05.54]Cool.
[322:06.26]Didn't take that much damage for a double.
[322:08.22]I'm happy with that.
[322:08.88]Bro, just accept her love, bro.
[322:13.72]Calm down.
[322:14.08]Yep.
[322:35.32]And it's a heart that flies out now.
[322:37.14]I don't have enough money to buy maybe health.
[322:47.75]Maybe try to get attack speed with Hermes?
[322:59.99]This is free.
[323:03.54]Is this a fountain?
[323:07.12]Why is this just for free?
[323:10.26]Move speed.
[323:11.88]Your special is faster.
[323:12.63]Hmm.
[323:12.75]That's just... Yeah.
[323:37.90]And here we go.
[323:39.04]Just move a little bit faster.
[323:40.24]That's fine.
[323:40.72]Alright, let's fight this boss.
[323:54.49]Get back in the magma and no one gets hurt.
[324:15.43]Hey, bring out your little friends!
[324:31.12]Shit, I missed it.
[324:45.06]Just long shot it, man.
[324:53.80]And here we go.
[325:06.49]Okay, now let's do this.
[325:13.81]Get out!
[325:14.81]Show yourself!
[325:34.18]Shit!
[325:34.74]Oh fuck!
[325:35.46]I'm taking a lot of damage.
[325:36.10]This is bad.
[325:59.81]Okay, we're good.
[326:15.64]Goodbye.
[326:17.10]Oh, I wanted to end it on a... Why?
[326:21.96]He's gonna choke.
[326:22.84]No, I'm not gonna choke.
[326:28.24]Choking is for the third boss fight, not for the second one.
[326:32.24]Did I miss anything?
[326:51.00]Fountain, this is a full heal and it's plus 3% damage permanently, right?
[326:55.36]That's pretty awesome.
[327:06.74]That's pretty good too.
[327:09.44]Only 20 gold?
[327:10.18]I'm taking it.
[327:22.01]Save the money, save the money.
[327:23.19]Well, I'm good.
[327:29.49]Yeah, whatever happens here, this is going to be the end.
[327:32.25]I'll see you tomorrow for chat's choice after this.
[327:35.53]We'll go back to this.
[327:38.15]Maybe I'll just beat it.
[327:39.31]Let's just beat it today.
[327:40.93]Let's beat it right now.
[327:41.81]This is the run to beat it.
[327:42.93]I'm going to go for it.
[327:47.26]Hammer.
[327:52.50]More long spears.
[328:00.59]Why did I... That was a weird throw.
[328:15.86]I'm having so much fun!
[328:17.07]I'm having so much fun!
[328:20.11]I'm having so much fun!
[328:41.72]I'm having so much fun.
[328:45.35]Alrighty then.
[328:56.29]How far away is far away?
[328:58.35]Because that will kill almost every single enemy in the game in one hit.
[329:09.32]What do I do?
[329:14.56]Hey, stop.
[329:15.32]My mouse is being stupid.
[329:19.54]I mean, it's that.
[329:20.78]Your attack fires two shots side by side, but reduce damage?
[329:27.97]It only applies to distant foes.
[329:29.57]Right.
[329:30.83]But how far is distant?
[329:42.68]Reduced range.
[329:44.14]Oh, but... Okay, so this is double damage.
[329:52.06]This is... This is two times.
[330:03.93]I made my decision.
[330:05.11]That's it.
[330:08.15]Holy shit, it's two.
[330:16.30]That's going to be insane though.
[330:17.72]You want to know the best part about this?
[330:23.60]I don't even have to worry about charging the whole thing.
[330:27.74]Just get it and move around.
[330:29.89]Land the perfect shot.
[330:30.85]Land the shot you know you can land.
[330:32.09]Get out.
[330:39.83]Test it.
[330:44.62]Am I there?
[330:45.82]No, not you there.
[330:46.84]Hey, you there.
[330:58.23]I don't I'm overwhelmed.
[331:01.54]Useless.
[331:03.16]There we go.
[331:07.34]Right now.
[331:10.30]You there.
[331:13.55]That's alright, I don't know why I think that's funny.
[331:26.10]You up?
[331:29.14]Alright, I gotta play, I gotta play, I gotta play.
[331:30.95]You up?
[331:32.19]That's 500 damage, man.
[331:32.91]Holy shit, that's 700 damage!
[331:43.80]You ain't got nothing.
[331:45.67]This is game over if I don't act like a dumbass.
[331:50.67]Hey, you there?
[331:52.23]You there, man?
[331:52.75]Come on.
[332:23.61]This is a super boss killer and we have another opportunity for Hermes for increased super damage speed.
[332:38.69]Oh shit, that was bad.
[332:42.95]This is so good, I can't blow this.
[333:10.57]Get out of here, you little mutant.
[333:35.02]Alright, Hermes.
[333:36.80]Bail me out here.
[333:37.48]You attack it 10% faster.
[333:38.66]Charge more. ...
[334:06.40]Gotta survive, man.
[334:10.30]Gotta survive, man.
[334:11.18]I gotta survive, man.
[334:12.54]I've gotta survive, man.
[334:13.68]I have to.
[334:15.20]I don't... The attack speed... Is that really that big of a deal?
[334:18.54]Because I... It's not charge speed.
[334:20.98]It's just how fast I draw the bow.
[334:25.03]Right?
[334:27.45]But that's okay.
[334:29.03]10% is nothing.
[334:31.71]Having the third dash is a major deal.
[334:34.09]Don't worry.
[334:34.35]We're gonna get something else right here.
[334:40.78]Look.
[334:41.94]Look!
[334:43.76]It's already okay.
[334:49.90]Poseidon's aid got leveled up to level one.
[334:51.78]There we go.
[334:58.95]Just what I need.
[335:06.24]Your dash damages expose an area.
[335:08.74]Your boons with knock away also rupture.
[335:13.56]Victim takes damage while moving.
[335:16.61]Does the explosive count as a rupture?
[335:20.87]I need a dash.
[335:23.41]Yeah, I need it.
[335:24.29]It's true.
[335:26.11]I do need a dash.
[335:26.73]You're right.
[335:39.82]Always a pleasure, Charon.
[335:40.92]Okay.
[335:45.65]Fish?
[335:45.89]No.
[335:45.97]The vast and multitudinous riches of both the surface and the underworld are hoarded by the river boatman, Charon.
[335:52.39]The mentor.
[335:53.21]Whose services?
[335:54.85]He really gets around.
[335:56.70]Tell Hermes Hay for me.
[336:01.38]Soul-sucking butterflies.
[336:08.41]That's so much fucking damage, man.
[336:10.27]It really is.
[336:22.59]It's so much damage.
[336:26.20]Hey, where'd you come from?
[336:33.96]Alright, this is bad.
[336:34.82]Hold on.
[336:54.64]Get that shit off my body!
[337:12.08]Who else?
[337:19.68]Took a lot of damage for that.
[337:23.38]Playing 10 chill stacks causes a blast effect.
[337:29.72]Any health... Yeah, it's time.
[337:32.12]I need this.
[337:33.44]While you have no... What?
[337:40.65]While you have no... So, throw out the... Oh, no, that's not good.
[337:45.13]That doesn't synergize with what I have.
[337:55.37]Doesn't synergize with what I have.
[337:58.45]Because don't I have the thing?
[337:59.23]Because look.
[338:00.17]It's just going to recharge it in three seconds.
[338:02.71]I have it again.
[338:09.53]I mean, if I had the other one ready, I'd throw it out.
[338:11.68]And I just don't use the casting again.
[338:13.34]I can go around and do more damage.
[338:14.42]Because I'm just going to get the crystal back.
[338:19.84]Okay.
[338:21.12]I'm going to say... Money.
[338:24.00]Money.
[338:28.78]Because I can get a boon before the boss.
[338:32.81]Sidon is better, sure.
[338:39.69]Oh, that was a really good choice.
[338:43.47]I don't know how you guys knew that was going to happen, but I just got more damage.
[338:46.47]How did you guys know that was going to happen?
[338:51.22]Within the delicately hewn constructions of Elysium exist places of peace so utterly serene and absolute as mortal kind is seldom to experience during the average short and often painful coil.
[339:07.46]Is this really as good as it gets for mortal kind?
[339:09.62]It's one.
[339:20.00]Slamming foes into barriers.
[339:23.23]How do I do that?
[339:25.99]How do I slam?
[339:31.63]If I dash into them?
[339:34.38]It's too late for one.
[339:37.56]Okay, I'm pulling the slot machine.
[339:43.82]I'll hang on to these.
[339:55.15]Good, you got breakfast wraps.
[340:05.42]Pretty pog, if you ask me.
[340:20.91]Good timing on that one.
[340:25.07]Good timing on that one.
[340:30.75]This shit bounces around, not fair.
[340:47.38]I would call that a clean room.
[340:53.32]I'd call that a clean room.
[341:00.93]Even more health.
[341:02.95]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[341:04.55]Even more health.
[341:22.74]Eat shit!
[341:27.42]Don't let the little bulbs get away.
[341:33.05]Wait, just let him come to me.
[341:33.93]Let him come to me.
[341:34.82]What's the point?
[341:43.63]How'd this go with this build?
[341:46.17]Yeah, it is.
[342:02.61]Give me a break.
[342:03.29]You're bouncing the shit everywhere.
[342:04.43]You're not even trying.
[342:05.95]You're just spamming in random directions.
[342:09.61]Where are you?
[342:17.57]This is the first time I've ever had 200 health.
[342:18.87]Uh, alright.
[342:24.04]Do I want... Up the shop.
[342:27.06]Chaos?
[342:32.22]Where?
[342:34.24]Where?
[342:38.18]Where?
[342:41.08]You lying?
[342:41.48]Oh.
[342:41.80]Alright, this is it.
[342:55.45]Here we go.
[342:57.07]I'll pay for that.
[343:11.18]I mean, I have to take three.
[343:15.91]When it's out, I do more damage.
[343:17.33]Take this, too.
[343:17.79]Why not?
[343:19.87]Ross Flourish.
[343:20.87]Got upgraded.
[343:21.43]What does that one do?
[343:22.29]What the hell is it?
[343:43.16]Oh, it's wicked good, it's wicked good, it's wicked good, it's wicked good.
[343:46.85]Alright, let's go.
[343:47.57]I'm gonna kill that Minotaur.
[343:49.43]I'm gonna rip his eyes out.
[343:57.17]Hey, everyone.
[343:57.69]I'm back.
[343:59.05]So, Hellspawn.
[344:01.07]You seek to break through to the surface of the world.
[344:04.11]But you shall not achieve your goal whilst I yet live and breathe.
[344:08.63]Or the equivalent of it here in the splendors of Elysium.
[344:11.69]Spamming the bomb.
[344:12.81]I'm going to say hit B over and over again.
[344:14.44]Can you leave me with little choice but to make you... One, two, three.
[344:18.26]One, two, three.
[344:19.24]Go, go, go.
[344:20.22]They love us, Asterius.
[344:40.70]you fiend
[345:10.81]I did a little damage to him.
[345:28.00]I did a little damage to him.
[345:39.27]Come here!
[345:40.65]Come here!
[345:41.03]Where's he?
[345:42.01]Where's the ball?
[346:09.26]Ow, that hurt.
[346:18.54]You fucker.
[346:34.33]Fuck.
[346:41.38]Oh god, somebody just made me laugh.
[346:44.78]Somebody just fucking... Why did I look at chat?
[347:14.31]Alright, this is it!
[347:15.95]You block everything, you fucking punk!
[348:16.76]That ought to make Theseus shut it for a bit.
[348:46.60]And I got full health and two revives.
[348:51.30]Dad, I'm coming for you now.
[348:54.50]I'm coming for Dad.
[348:57.15]I might even have to break out something really important for Dad.
[349:08.91]We'll see.
[349:11.95]I'm going to have to whip out something for Dad.
[349:14.57]No, something else.
[349:29.34]Stop stop stop stop it.
[349:33.43]Oh my god.
[349:34.27]Why did I say it like that?
[349:38.95]I'm just gonna buy this it's 15 bucks Alright, let's go
[349:48.90]I gotta be careful.
[349:50.74]I'm gonna save Poseidon's explosive.
[349:53.82]Why would you waste your money on that?
[349:54.99]Doesn't that work at dad?
[349:58.43]You did that.
[349:58.85]What?
[350:00.19]Did you swap out the purse already?
[350:01.95]I hope so.
[350:02.99]Yeah.
[350:06.67]I'm ready.
[350:08.72]One last stop.
[350:21.62]The temple.
[350:26.62]Some fish in here, right?
[350:27.52]Some of those urns have coin in them, don't they?
[350:29.45]Oops.
[350:30.29]He even told me.
[350:34.65]Alright.
[350:35.27]What do we got?
[350:35.91]We've got pomegranates.
[350:40.75]Poseidon.
[350:43.20]Poseidon.
[350:45.54]Which tunnel?
[350:48.09]Wait, there's a fish in this last... Okay, I don't want to screw this up.
[350:51.22]So... You can get faked out here.
[350:56.06]So wait for the ding?
[351:05.48]Sure, why not?
[351:13.07]Not quite.
[351:17.56]Whatever.
[351:20.47]Mm-hmm.
[351:26.53]So, we're going with... We're going with... Elf.
[351:44.79]Okay.
[351:45.57]I kind of had no idea what the hell was going on in this room.
[352:02.43]Good.
[352:03.71]Come on.
[352:04.23]This is the one.
[352:05.25]This is the one.
[352:06.65]This is the run.
[352:36.89]Woohoo!
[353:00.47]Oh shit Final room Holy shit those things fall down
[353:33.32]No poison.
[353:34.36]Don't get touched by that shit.
[353:39.97]Who's left?
[353:41.23]Oh, you.
[353:45.15]King.
[353:47.57]225 health.
[353:50.99]And a shop.
[353:55.69]Oh, no.
[353:56.13]No, none of it.
[353:59.62]Is it an urn?
[354:09.62]I don't have enough money.
[354:14.96]Alright.
[354:17.44]Frozen time.
[354:30.70]This is so good.
[354:31.62]It's so much damage.
[354:32.58]It's so wonderful.
[354:33.46]I had an itchy nose for a second.
[354:38.93]Sorry.
[354:39.17]I had to just rip my hand up and just smack into the microphone.
[354:55.18]Oh!
[354:55.58]Almost got hit.
[354:57.94]Very close.
[355:32.23]Get out!
[355:32.75]Don't get poisoned.
[355:34.95]Poison.
[355:40.12]I'm poisoned.
[355:40.68]Where's the cure?
[355:53.60]Where's the cure?
[355:57.79]No, thanks.
[356:01.59]I can feel it in my loins right now.
[356:02.91]Don't say that yet.
[356:03.91]Don't say that.
[356:04.66]What's going on?
[356:05.80]Are you a duo?
[356:28.06]Your... Wait.
[356:30.54]Your cast blasts an area with freezing fog that inflicts chill, plus 30% more damage.
[356:37.35]Wait, what?
[356:40.77]What?
[356:41.01]What?
[356:46.04]What?
[356:50.02]And it sticks around for a while too.
[356:51.62]Okay.
[356:54.68]Okay.
[356:56.50]Alright.
[356:57.86]Alright.
[356:59.22]This should be... I should make out pretty well here.
[357:02.64]This is the best build I've probably had since playing the game.
[357:10.39]Money or pomegranate?
[357:22.53]I bet it's in here.
[357:40.56]I'm gonna get quadruple comboed by dad somehow.
[357:43.98]It's gonna be like... I was in the air the whole time, by the way.
[357:49.77]He saw me.
[358:11.97]Never been this far.
[358:31.34]No.
[358:32.54]No.
[358:33.34]No.
[358:33.90]No.
[358:34.14]Does this count for dad?
[358:35.04]No.
[358:37.30]No.
[358:42.06]Oops, I missed.
[359:10.21]Holy shit, I didn't even know those were there.
[359:13.21]That's good to know.
[359:14.11]Holy shit!
[359:20.55]I was trying to move into a safe spot.
[359:32.02]This room sucks.
[359:34.84]This room sucks.
[359:53.70]Your attack deals more damage and inflicts weak.
[359:57.26]Your cast lobs a larger area or your call is better.
[360:02.28]Should I do more attack or the cast damage does more?
[360:07.06]Definitely, just let's go straight up damage.
[360:09.60]Alright, I got two revives.
[360:11.81]Still haven't found the sack, by the way.
[360:13.03]This is kind of unlucky, isn't it?
[360:17.71]I need health.
[360:30.88]I need to keep looking down those passageways.
[360:32.86]I only got two more left.
[360:33.78]I'm going to go with money, right?
[360:36.86]Alright.
[360:37.30]Do I buy Poseidon right now or pomegranate right now?
[360:40.22]I think you guys are very torn on this.
[360:55.63]Don't spend it all in one place, mate.
[361:03.57]The fog, I think.
[361:07.96]Yep, alright.
[361:09.74]I gotta heal.
[361:10.90]I need a fountain.
[361:13.12]Give me a fountain here somewhere.
[361:15.76]Money.
[361:16.84]This one, I guess.
[361:31.82]Don't want to sell anything.
[361:53.78]What did I... A codex update?
[361:55.10]What?
[361:56.48]What?
[361:57.22]Hey, did you hear about this guy?
[361:59.36]He's not even in this room.
[362:00.92]He's cool though.
[362:08.44]What we got?
[362:15.98]Lost time.
[362:36.46]This is horrible.
[362:43.51]Holy shit, that was horrible.
[362:46.39]I still don't have the- still don't have the- the sack to give the dog?
[362:51.13]What are you trying to do to me here, game?
[363:03.25]This better be a fountain.
[363:07.48]Buy another palm?
[363:21.55]I don't want to do Anvil.
[363:22.43]Anvil scares me a little.
[363:27.56]Anvil scares me.
[363:28.24]I don't want to lose something and gain something.
[363:33.37]Palm is double.
[363:34.43]It's a double palm?
[363:36.25]It's a double... Wait, this is... Poseidon has a heel.
[363:39.23]He does.
[363:40.03]But what if I don't get it?
[363:41.29]What if I don't get it?
[363:46.16]Palm is two levels.
[363:56.32]Oh my god, what happened?
[364:00.84]Why?! !
[364:03.29]Why?
[364:05.59]Your call pulls in... Your attack and special is stronger in the first 10 seconds.
[364:11.74]Any boons you find are more potent.
[364:13.44]There's no more.
[364:20.74]The power of the sea.
[364:24.57]Should have done the double palm.
[364:26.77]I actually might still be able to do it, depending.
[364:28.51]Is this going to be... Maybe this way.
[364:33.23]Give me some money.
[364:45.22]Run has been ruined.
[364:46.32]Not yet.
[364:46.70]Man, I might die in here once.
[364:48.79]That's not good.
[364:57.49]Shit, they're everywhere.
[365:00.91]Need money.
[365:01.97]Come on.
[365:03.23]No urns?
[365:05.55]Urns.
[365:06.01]Please.
[365:06.55]Please.
[365:07.19]Urns.
[365:07.53]200 gold.
[365:11.23]It's not enough.
[365:22.91]Not enough.
[365:29.06]Cerberus must be starving.
[365:30.51]Oh my god.
[365:30.87]Oh my god.
[365:34.05]Oh my god.
[365:37.11]Oh my god.
[365:38.18]Oh my god.
[365:38.56]Oh my god.
[365:39.24]This is the one.
[365:40.20]This is the one.
[365:41.52]Your attack deals more damage.
[365:42.78]Plus 53%.
[365:44.70]Wait, it replaces what?
[365:50.35]Your boons with knockback also rupture.
[365:52.21]More rupture.
[366:00.23]I don't want to replace Heartbreak Strike.
[366:06.60]Who's the only good option?
[366:07.70]Full health, two revives, god build.
[366:13.22]What could go wrong?
[366:16.34]We'll find out soon enough.
[366:21.83]I don't have enough money to buy anything.
[366:27.05]Alright, this is it.
[366:27.81]Let's go.
[366:34.13]Don't throw for views.
[366:35.25]Why would I do that, man?
[366:36.39]Okay, I'm not gonna do, I'm not gonna throw for views.
[366:38.89]Have you seen how I've been playing?
[366:40.27]I'm not just throwing, I'm like walking off a cliff.
[366:42.31]I'm not throwing for views.
[366:44.59]Plus, why would we throw for views?
[366:46.78]Like, like 2,000 people have left by tonight, by right now.
[366:51.34]Am I gonna go die now and be like, whoopsie?
[366:53.96]I should have done that four hours ago.
[366:59.82]Alright, let's go.
[367:00.30]This is it.
[367:01.45]This is it.
[367:01.91]Just relax.
[367:02.67]Just relax.
[367:03.31]I'm good.
[367:08.44]It's just regular.
[367:11.74]It's just a regular video game.
[367:14.66]You get to kill the boss.
[367:15.48]That's it.
[367:16.92]I'm not going to look at chat.
[367:17.74]I'm not.
[367:20.21]Alright, come on, dad.
[367:21.87]Let's go.
[367:23.19]Always keep your cast out.
[367:25.67]Move around.
[367:29.07]Take a bunch of less damage.
[367:30.45]Just get the shots in.
[367:32.76]Just do it.
[367:38.62]Hide behind the pillars during the lasers.
[367:41.08]I hope I remember that.
[367:42.02]I hope I don't forget that.
[367:45.56]I'm looking for a full first phase without using one of my lives.
[367:50.10]Alright, let's go.
[367:53.40]I feel like I gotta get the cords off me.
[367:55.75]...when Cerberus would never have permitted any soul to exit through that gateway there behind you.
[368:12.65]What you're about to hear is encouragement and praise with cheering applause just for you.
[368:21.17]Acknowledging you for a variety of reasons.
[368:25.39]If there is a situation that does not apply to you, just listen.
[368:30.99]See how DMCA from Cheers to You don't think that's going to happen.
[368:36.25]Let's go.
[368:36.81]Get ready.
[368:40.91]Here it comes.
[368:48.54]We want to thank you for all your hard work.
[368:56.76]You're the one who steps up and gets things done around here.
[369:03.66]You keep your word, you deliver what you promise, and then you go the extra mile.
[369:13.43]You're doing a great job!
[369:15.87]A great job!
[369:24.26]If anyone asks, we'll tell them.
[369:27.74]A great job!
[369:32.17]Slow down!

[370:54.20]That recognition you're seeking.
[370:57.30]It is yours.
[371:02.60]Just listen.
[371:03.92]Everyone agrees.

[371:11.72]We're here for you.
[371:13.74]We believe in you.
[371:18.12]We believe in you.
[372:11.27]I know you know this, but I want to say it again.
[372:15.85]I'm so glad we're back together.
[372:26.81]No matter what has ever happened in my life, you have always been there for me.
[372:33.31]And that's the greatest gift anyone could ever receive.
[372:37.07]The greatest gift anyone could ever give.
[372:44.84]You've got the biggest heart of anyone I know.
[372:48.00]Look up love in the dictionary, and there's your picture.
[373:05.11]Thank you, my friend.
[373:11.71]I can't even hear what they're saying.
[373:13.59]The crowd is too loud.
[373:17.31]The crowd's too loud.
[373:20.85]Come on, say it!
[373:29.49]Alright, the crowd's dying down.
[373:39.29]Tell her Cerberus is doing very well.
[373:41.89]Cerberus is doing very well.
[373:43.03]Good.
[373:47.27]We did it.
[373:47.63]Hooray.
[373:48.55]I beat the game on normal difficulty.
[373:51.17]Wow.
[373:51.79]That excite... That build was... It's so good, though.
[374:02.53]What?
[374:03.47]Wait, I don't think I owe you any favors here.
[374:05.38]Now answer me one question and I'll give it some thought.
[374:08.48]How's that?
[374:09.54]I thought I was going to choke at the end there.
[374:11.52]When I took the second death.
[374:12.56]I was like, I'm dead.
[374:14.63]I was like, no.
[374:15.89]Because he only had like 60% health left.
[374:17.41]I was like, what if I'm going to die here?
[374:24.27]I'll just do that nine more times.
[374:27.20]Okay.
[374:27.32]Mm-hmm.
[374:34.36]Thank you, Patty Cake, for the 20 community subs.
[374:36.04]That's an insane amount of money.
[374:38.28]And Daddy Warbucks with five.
[374:39.89]Thank you, guys.
[374:42.91]Oh, we're getting lore here.
[374:45.43]Hold on.
[374:45.67]Hold on.
[375:07.55]Oh, this is like, hey, you did it.
[375:09.97]Clear time, 56 minutes.
[375:11.65]New record.
[375:13.69]Current streak, 1.
[375:15.57]Best streak, 1.
[375:17.53]Total clear, 1.
[375:19.43]Hooray.
[375:29.72]Oh, here it is.
[375:31.50]I got a lot of things to spend, too.
[375:34.62]Ugh.
[375:35.20]That was hard, but fun.
[375:37.72]This build was disgusting.
[375:39.17]That's the only reason why I beat it.
[375:47.33]Very cool.
[375:47.85]Now what?
[375:48.49]Oh.
[375:54.04]You know what was the big run saver here?
[375:55.54]The double.
[375:58.78]Shooting two of these together.
[375:59.92]Just too good.
[376:08.32]leave it was the cast that did it probably I got the duo cast right beyond the frozen overlook await the first glimpse of the sun to your left made it to Greece through the cold sure hope this works next
[376:43.35]It would be kind of funny if, instead of Greece, just said, like, Cleveland or something.
[376:49.48]Like, wait, what?
[376:51.70]The surface, windswept, wracked by freezing cold, nonetheless instills within the prince a sense of awe and the sublime.
[377:01.98]For it is unlike anything that he has seen.
[377:06.32]Cerberus goes to Cleveland.
[377:10.45]It's beautiful.
[377:16.80]It is beautiful, isn't it?
[377:32.94]Oh, that's nice.
[377:35.60]That thing.
[377:37.59]That's the sun.
[377:39.23]Can I not be outside during this?
[377:40.65]Is it a fire or something?
[377:44.11]Is my skin burned?
[377:44.87]Am I like a vampire?
[377:59.25]There's not a final boss.
[378:03.65]Is there?
[378:04.97]I feel like there could be.
[378:10.69]Wow!
[378:11.67]I made it to Greece where they have only one food instead of three foods.
[378:19.29]Oh, fuck this place.
[378:20.51]All you have is tomatoes.
[378:23.83]We had at least fish and bread downstairs.
[378:29.64]And I think... I don't know about this.
[378:32.79]Who might you be wandering all the way out here?
[378:35.79]You're trespassing on private property, you know.
[378:38.85]Speak up.
[378:42.31]What about the cabbage?
[378:44.47]Oh, yeah, I'm not going to eat, like, grass.
[378:46.76]What, you want me to eat, like, trees?
[378:49.36]Grass?
[378:49.84]No, thank you.
[378:51.72]Meat and cheese only.
[378:53.14]Persephone, my name is Zagreus, and I think I might be your son.
[379:04.48]Get out of here.
[379:05.82]Get out or I shall make you.
[379:07.42]I thought it said make out with you.
[379:12.54]I didn't read the you after the second line there.
[379:16.07]Get out of here or I shall make out with you.
[379:18.37]No.
[379:20.09]So then you are her.
[379:22.13]I don't care if you hate me but I'm not leaving until I get some answers.
[379:25.87]I never even knew you existed.
[379:27.95]Why did you leave me?
[379:30.44]What is Persephone the god of?
[379:32.86]You died.
[379:33.74]Verdure.
[379:35.06]Verdure?
[379:36.52]What is verdure?
[379:37.82]They sputtered out when you were born.
[379:42.44]But now you're standing here before me.
[379:46.38]What beauty.
[379:52.00]I died?
[379:53.14]I died?
[379:53.80]What, you mean permanently died, but I'm alive?
[379:56.86]Oh, gods.
[379:58.64]Okay, settle down mom, I'm not Frankenstein.
[380:01.90]I'm a boy, I'm a real boy.
[380:31.27]Shut up, Jerma.
[380:33.43]In short, I beat him finally, though he did everything he could to prevent our meeting here like this.
[380:39.09]But there's something he wanted me to tell you in the end.
[380:42.13]He said to tell you Cerberus is doing very well.
[380:47.29]I don't know.
[380:48.77]Just walked over here.
[380:50.52]I have a live sickness.
[380:52.10]I definitely have a live sickness.
[380:54.38]I'm not supposed to be alive.
[381:17.16]No, no, that isn't it.
[381:20.16]It's that you cannot stay here.
[381:25.42]You can't stay here.
[381:28.06]Really, you're kicking me out.
[381:31.08]Why?
[381:32.68]The fates are cruel, Zagreus.
[381:35.37]You're bound to that place.
[381:37.73]Same as your father.
[381:39.97]So they would have us say goodbye for now.
[381:44.35]My heart soars knowing you live.
[381:47.45]But then it breaks that our time together was so brief.
[381:51.96]No, I can come back.
[381:55.22]I can come back.
[381:56.54]Now that I found you, he... Maybe he'll just let me come back.
[382:00.00]So I have to fight my way out of Hades to hang out with my mother for 15 minutes a day.
[382:06.80]Huh.
[382:12.01]You tell him I demand it.
[382:14.64]And I demand he also tell me how come he, or for that matter, Nyx, never sent notice that you lived.
[382:22.95]Olympus is all rife with schemers.
[382:26.25]But I was so naive to think that they were different.
[382:31.04]I'll tell him.
[382:32.42]I'll tell him.
[382:33.66]I feel awful.
[382:36.14]I... I have to go.
[382:39.43]Does it cut scene us or do I have to actually walk back?
[382:41.63]However long it takes.
[383:07.35]This is a pretty sick prank by dad.
[383:15.56]House of Hades.
[383:16.68]Hooray.
[383:17.02]Oh, hi.
[383:18.42]Yeah.
[383:21.28]That was fun.
[383:22.00]Does he remember that I killed him?
[383:36.52]no wait what I vanquished you in single combat and finally found mother and that's all you have to say to me nonsense don't you think I would recall such an event you can't be serious so I went back in time or something though it never happened she wants answers same as I do she demands you let me pass let me go to her again silence this discussion is over
[384:05.52]I hardly think this is the time or place to indulge your overwrought imagination.
[384:09.91]Gaslighting.
[384:12.61]Right.
[384:13.85]Gotta kill him a bunch more times.
[384:18.77]Well.
[384:20.75]Mm-hmm.
[384:21.66]Might as well just get the fountain upgrade.
[384:24.90]And I'm gonna call it here.
[384:26.22]That's a good place to stop for the day.
[384:29.58]But I'm gonna do my upgrades first.
[384:33.13]Are you the one whom I should thank for this most wondrous music stand, my friend?
[384:37.35]Why, it is positively splendid, isn't it?
[384:39.59]Go to the quests?
[384:42.39]Yeah, I'm going to go make sure I do all my tasks.
[384:46.29]I'm pleased you like it, Orpheus.
[384:48.07]Though, tell me something.
[384:49.71]How can I play your music when you're not even here?
[384:53.89]Who can explain the secret art of Daedalus, my friend?
[384:57.36]Know only that whenever it produces music for your listening enjoyment, that the sound you hear is coming from my soul!
[385:04.36]Amazing.
[385:08.23]And a bit unsettling.
[385:09.91]Hi, Nyx.
[385:10.49]Your father fell to you as once his father fell to him.
[385:14.53]Although you are substantially more merciful.
[385:17.49]I know it is a bitter victory at best I doubt it though tell me what transpired subsequently that you have returned did you locate your birth mother I did I she was there she was where you said she'd be and more than I imagined but I had so little time with her I can't survive up there for very long why didn't you tell me I'd just die no matter what
[385:43.08]Oh, my child.
[385:45.08]I say this seldomly, but I did not know 80s through for views to believe that the surface would have such an effect on you, but it seems you share your father's fate after all.
[385:59.41]He's playing cheers to you.
[386:00.53]I really got to take a bow on this one.
[386:05.35]Every time he loses with cheers to you, he gets really sad because that's supposed to give him super powers.
[386:12.01]Right.
[386:15.12]My father's fate.
[386:16.64]But he was smugly waiting for me up there and seemed quite healthy all in all.
[386:21.17]Though maybe the farther we get from this realm, the worse we get.
[386:25.51]Because he... So I now presume you are bound to this realm by powers greater even than mine.
[386:32.73]Tell me something.
[386:34.27]If you knew that you could only see Persephone for but a moment's time, would you still make the journey to her there?
[386:44.04]Yes.
[386:45.15]Yes, I would.
[386:46.33]I had so many questions left for her.
[386:49.39]Then go and ask them, child.
[386:52.44]Set your resolve and find her there again.
[386:54.74]And use well what brief time you have with one another whilst you can.
[387:00.36]As mortals do.
[387:01.94]What does Tumblr game even mean?
[387:05.74]I don't know what that's supposed to mean.
[387:10.05]I haven't given Nyx a gift?
[387:15.09]Zagreus, please tell me that the rumors are untrue.
[387:18.31]You really vanquished him.
[387:19.81]Ivanka Trump.
[387:20.29]Have you completely lost your mind?
[387:22.20]You're going to destroy this blasted house.
[387:25.88]Holy shit, that took a long... That was... Holy shit, that took forever.
[387:28.36]I was trying to figure out who it sounded like.
[387:31.68]Come on, Meg.
[387:32.22]Father had it coming for some time.
[387:34.06]What's your concern besides the house is safe?
[387:38.10]He's not going to take this lying down.
[387:40.22]He'll find some way to take it out on you, on all of us.
[387:43.62]You watch yourself or all of us will pay.
[387:48.76]I will not let that happen.
[387:56.75]I didn't get a new fish.
[387:59.27]Take that back.
[388:01.31]It's a great voice.
[388:02.17]It's a great voice acting.
[388:06.68]It's time for me to give my final review of the game.
[388:08.59]Voice acting?
[388:10.41]Incredible.
[388:10.79]98 out of 100.
[388:13.42]Very, like, just across the board.
[388:14.96]Just fantastic.
[388:16.02]All the characters are perfectly cast.
[388:17.26]It's fucking, it's phenomenal.
[388:20.51]Two, the combat.
[388:22.63]It's great.
[388:23.19]It trickles you new weapons.
[388:24.35]You can play with them.
[388:25.27]You find the ones you like.
[388:26.19]Then there's still ones that I don't even have.
[388:28.27]Very good.
[388:28.75]Very awesome.
[388:30.19]The upgrade system is... Whoa.
[388:34.54]All the combos, the duos, the rarity.
[388:36.92]It gives you the rarity itch.
[388:38.80]Oh, RNG, I got a fucking epic.
[388:40.26]Alright, cool.
[388:41.08]Perfect.
[388:41.56]Great.
[388:41.98]That's a 10.
[388:42.22]The enemies that can shoot you across the map.
[388:50.03]That's a 4.
[388:50.37]I don't like that.
[388:55.07]But that has like 1% weighted on the index here.
[389:04.90]Sometimes it can get a little confusing.
[389:06.64]There's a lot of stuff going on on the screen.
[389:07.78]You can get lost.
[389:08.32]I like the areas.
[389:14.27]I like the art style.
[389:15.81]It looks cool.
[389:17.61]Greek and Roman mythology.
[389:18.89]It's cool.
[389:25.17]It's a 94.
[389:28.63]And it's not over.
[389:40.03]Oh, I know.
[389:42.45]I know that.
[389:44.63]Weapon room or no balls.
[389:46.07]I'm gonna walk over there.
[389:47.01]Just hold on.
[389:55.38]Wow, that's... Okay, that's how you get that.
[390:03.15]Thousand, holy shit.
[390:04.69]Okay, hold on.
[390:07.67]Nothing else, right?
[390:11.92]14 out of 30.
[390:12.38]Renovations.
[390:16.16]Oh, okay.
[390:17.56]What am I still missing here?
[390:18.38]I need more keys!
[390:27.83]Where's Thanatos?
[390:31.83]I don't know.
[390:37.93]The exit.
[390:39.19]Once in a while, pal, you're going to see a real fancy bozo try to ruin your good time.
[390:43.58]You'll know him because he's glowing like a light.
[390:45.60]But that's his special armor, see?
[390:47.72]You got to punch right through it.
[390:49.14]He's going to shrug you off until you do.
[390:52.48]For a good time, beware the fancy glowing bozos on my quest.
[391:00.23]Wow, it has bullets?
[391:01.13]Hold then release to bombard.
[391:02.41]That's awesome.
[391:30.14]That reloads.
[391:34.72]Push in R to reload?
[391:40.65]Can I change that keybinding if I ever wanted to do that?
[391:42.63]I don't like that keybind.
[391:45.87]It's awkward.
[391:51.10]It's kind of like the bow and the gloves combined together.
[392:05.92]Look at the window.
[392:08.64]What the hell does this say?
[392:11.46]Prepare.
[392:11.82]Congratulations, your deeds have compelled Lord Hades to serve you a pact of punishment.
[392:16.10]Here's how it works.
[392:17.79]Pact can make escaping more difficult via various nasty conditions.
[392:21.49]Each condition you accept adds some heat to your heat gauge.
[392:25.09]While your heat gauge is full, you can earn valuable bounties.
[392:29.28]You earn one bounty the first time you vanquish the boss of each underworld region while your heat gauge is full.
[392:35.52]Once you successfully escape, you can earn more bounties if you turn up the heat.
[392:38.94]And you can earn bounties for each weapon.
[392:40.88]How much heat you need is per weapon as well.
[392:45.91]Uh... Oops, can I take that off?
[392:50.51]Choose any condition if you dare.
[392:51.99]Get out using the adamant rail.
[392:56.76]All prices are 40% more.
[392:57.74]Heat gauge exceeded.
[392:59.04]This is ridiculous.
[392:59.48]You have fewer choices when offered boons.
[393:21.58]Bounties.
[393:23.81]I get one heat and I use the rail.
[393:25.43]I get bounties for doing this.
[393:27.43]Achilles or I'm going to die.
[393:29.03]Hold on.
[393:29.75]I want to see.
[393:30.17]Hold on a minute.
[393:32.87]Quiet.
[393:34.31]Quiet.
[393:36.59]I demand silence.
[393:41.10]I'm a punching.
[393:41.72]Get off me.
[393:47.86]Let's see.
[393:56.08]I have so much.
[394:00.59]I don't want to spend anything.
[394:02.41]I'm not spending anything right now.
[394:08.09]Come here.
[394:09.33]Sure.
[394:09.87]But I'll just keep an eye on things in there.
[394:11.40]From time to time.
[394:11.98]In case you change your mind.
[394:13.46]So, goodbye.
[394:13.70]Bye.
[394:25.40]What's this deal?
[394:26.59]Alright, I'm gonna go talk to Achilles.
[394:29.13]Oh, that guy is gonna, like, smash his laptop into the ground.
[394:32.25]Here.
[394:32.41]What happened to you there?
[394:52.50]She was... she was great.
[394:55.14]Nothing like father, more like you a little bit, I guess.
[394:58.75]Though, being on the surface, it just seemed to suck the life right out of me.
[395:02.81]Even without the wretches of the underworld trying to do me in.
[395:07.49]But then you had a little time, at least.
[395:09.80]Sounds like you have unfinished business with her there.
[395:12.10]You got to her this once.
[395:13.78]Surely you're able to again, isn't that right?
[395:18.88]It is.
[395:19.98]I have to speak with her.
[395:25.44]Why did you want me to do that so bad?
[395:26.86]That was just a regular lower conversation.
[395:36.57]Because we like him.
[395:39.83]Alright, I'm going to call it here.
[395:43.27]I might still play this next week.
[395:45.75]We're going to change tomorrow.
[395:47.59]We're going to play something else.
[395:48.37]Chat's choice is tomorrow.
[395:49.51]Thanks for watching, everybody.
[395:56.90]I will give you a list of games to vote on.
[395:58.70]There'll be a poll tomorrow, pre-stream.
[396:02.53]The stream will be tomorrow around the same time it started today.
[396:05.13]Between somewhere around 1.30 or 2.
[396:07.87]I'll just set it to 2.
[396:11.41]And I'll see you later.
[396:12.11]Let's do the credits.
[396:18.14]I missed a few subs here.
[396:19.18]We had Bo.
[396:20.10]Thank you, Bo, for the five community subs.
[396:21.98]And Litigation.
[396:22.78]Thanks for five community subs.
[396:24.82]Community sheps.
[396:27.86]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[396:30.57]Have a great rest of your night.
[396:32.67]Let's get the... Actually, I'm going to pee while the credits roll.
[396:35.28]Have I peed all day?
[396:36.10]I don't know.
[396:37.42]I'll be back.
[396:37.82]I'll be right back.
[397:03.84]Thank you.
[398:17.46]Okay, I have subs to give.
[398:20.24]So, let's do them now.
[398:21.58]What was it at the total?
[398:22.88]25?
[398:22.90]25 subs, I believe.
[398:27.44]What it was.
[398:28.66]After the contract has now expired.
[398:30.24]Here come 25 community subs.
[398:36.12]Do it right now. 25.
[398:47.52]Thanks again, everybody, for watching.
[398:50.02]Oh, don't leave yet.
[398:50.82]Don't leave yet.
[398:51.58]Here they come.
[398:56.64]People didn't think I was going to do this.
[399:01.08]See you guys tomorrow.
[399:02.48]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[399:04.34]Take care of yourselves.
[399:06.15]I'm going to get up.
[399:07.57]See you tomorrow.
[399:08.73]Take care, guys.
[399:09.31]Goodbye.
[399:10.19]Take care, guys.
[399:26.14]you
[400:01.02]Thank you.
