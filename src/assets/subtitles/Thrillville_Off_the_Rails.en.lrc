[00:12.20]God damn it, I didn't write a title.
[00:14.04]Fuck.
[00:14.90]Oops.
[00:16.96]I was so busy getting here and turning the stream on that the title is just Amusements.
[00:20.56]It's a- that's the worst title.
[00:22.87]It's gotta be something better than that.
[00:26.05]Quick, quick, before the VOD can- can make the- seal it and keep it there.
[00:29.93]What's a great- what's a good- uh, it's Thrillville Off the Rails.
[00:36.52]Is Amusements fine?
[00:40.05]I mean, it's really boring, but does it get the point across?
[00:42.51]Maybe.
[00:42.79]Fun at the park.
[00:49.03]I think that's even worse.
[00:52.65]Hold on, hold on.
[00:53.45]Be right back.
[01:29.09]Anybody else have this problem?
[01:31.13]Where... You have a normal night's sleep.
[01:35.07]There's nothing weird about your sleep.
[01:36.73]It's just a kind of a normal night.
[01:39.12]But for some reason you wake up.
[01:41.62]And it's like you're living in another dimension.
[01:47.24]Everything's so groggy.
[01:48.26]The world is in slow motion.
[01:51.97]Like your head, like my eyes feel like they're in somebody else's head.
[01:57.81]Why does this happen?
[01:59.63]What happened today?
[02:01.77]That's every single morning.
[02:04.95]Any doctors in here dehydrated?
[02:06.57]No, I drink a lot of water.
[02:09.12]I always, before bed, and it kind of depends on the night, but I will always, before going to sleep, drink at least an eight ounce glass of water.
[02:18.34]Just like, just drink it and put it down.
[02:22.10]Usually over the course of a few minutes.
[02:25.52]Your breathing is being obstructed.
[02:29.88]Huh.
[02:31.74]Drink water.
[02:33.48]What about- Yeah, I always have to get up and pee after like four hours.
[02:35.93]I pee a lot anyways, though.
[02:38.31]It's caffeine?
[02:41.77]But I never drink coffee after four or five o'clock in the afternoon.
[02:44.89]I have a hard, strict cutoff of coffee.
[02:49.23]Coffee and me?
[02:51.45]We don't hang out after five o'clock.
[02:53.86]Six o'clock maximum, ever.
[02:57.47]It's all the cigarettes he's smoking.
[02:58.67]I don't smoke cigarettes.
[02:59.83]My voice just sounds like shit.
[03:03.68]My voice just sounds like this because I don't know.
[03:05.66]I've had a junky ass voice the last two years.
[03:07.70]I don't know why.
[03:12.09]I've been to an ENT.
[03:13.03]They've looked down there.
[03:13.85]They go, it looks fine.
[03:14.65]Everything looks great.
[03:17.91]Why is my voice such junk sometimes?
[03:20.00]What's going on here?
[03:28.15]It's in your head.
[03:33.73]Your voice is fine.
[03:34.85]Well, no, no, no, I'm just... It usually is, but sometimes, man, I just... I got these, like, cysts in my sinuses, and I swear to God, even if every doctor has told me, like, oh, they're fine, there's nothing wrong with it.
[03:48.22]Last year or so, man, I get, like, a blockage in my nose, my voice gets all junky.
[03:54.35]I've got to get him removed.
[03:55.15]I've got to get him out.
[03:58.06]Even if it's elective, just get rid of him.
[04:00.64]But he's called me a bestie?
[04:01.64]Oh, thanks.
[04:04.87]What WTF?
[04:06.21]Why is he live?
[04:11.15]I mean, I told you guys I was going to be live on Wednesday.
[04:14.89]Why are you getting your nose removed?
[04:16.51]No, I'm not getting my... I'm getting... Whatever.
[04:21.11]Today, we're going to play... Sorry I was about five minutes late.
[04:25.85]Happens...
[04:28.14]Today we're going to play Thrillville off the rails.
[04:31.66]Very highly requested game.
[04:35.30]I remember a long time ago, probably like four, at least three or four years ago, more than that, when I was still making YouTube videos a few times a week, I played this game for I think 10 minutes, and I was going to make a video on it, but I don't know why I didn't.
[04:54.12]Something in the first 15 minutes of the game made me stop playing, and then I just never came back.
[04:57.94]I don't know why.
[05:04.62]2013 was nine years ago.
[05:07.30]I know.
[05:08.20]This game fucks.
[05:10.58]This game sucks.
[05:16.03]Fuck, I just got... Why did that hurt?
[05:18.11]Oh, God.
[05:18.89]Why am I so old?
[05:23.47]You can, alright, let me tell you how you can tell when you're old.
[05:27.43]Or when you're getting older.
[05:29.64]I just realized something right now.
[05:33.00]The more that you hear me talk about me going to the doctor and medical issues that I may or may not have.
[05:38.56]I feel like a lot of our conversations are about me going to the doctor this one time.
[05:47.35]I remember having conversations with like grandparents.
[05:50.81]You know, I was at the doctor last night, and I'll tell you, I don't think, I'm not entirely sure he understands that my foot hurts.
[05:59.18]I'm doing that to you.
[06:01.34]And I'm only 36.
[06:01.78]Damn.
[06:02.00]Alright.
[06:10.89]So, this is an old game.
[06:12.97]This game came out in like 2006?
[06:13.77]2007?
[06:13.79]Classic?
[06:14.07]Classic?
[06:19.24]There are apparently a lot of mini games that people really want me to play.
[06:22.53]And I'm going to play them.
[06:23.41]I'm going to go for it.
[06:24.03]I'm going to give you guys a little bit of a content plan here now that we're in the new year.
[06:30.25]By the way, if you missed the New Year's Eve stream, I haven't had an opportunity to tell you.
[06:36.57]Happy New Year, first of all.
[06:39.87]Last time I streamed was on the 31st into the 1st of the new year.
[06:43.89]Hey, let's make this a good one.
[06:51.03]scrumptious cake this is the first real stream of 2022. what's my new year's resolution um I got too many there are way too many I have too many new year's resolutions it's not even worth telling people what they are it's not even a new year's resolution it's a new year's grocery list
[07:14.41]You don't tell anybody what a grocery list you have is.
[07:17.91]If you need like three or four items, like I need eggs, I need milk, and I need Doritos.
[07:22.72]You can tell people that.
[07:23.90]You can say that to somebody.
[07:25.82]I don't tell you the entire cart that I have to fill on a weekly or bi-weekly basis.
[07:32.74]It's way too many.
[07:38.93]Top three?
[07:40.88]They're all top three.
[07:43.02]All 40 of them are in the top three.
[07:46.47]They're just shoving each other around trying to get into the first spot.
[07:53.99]Top two?
[07:57.05]Uh... I'll give you... Well, no.
[08:00.11]This isn't even a resolution.
[08:02.64]I want to do... Okay. 2022...
[08:10.15]Who cares?
[08:12.33]I hope to do a little bit more laundry this year.
[08:16.63]That's a real one.
[08:17.83]And that might even be number two.
[08:18.89]Okay, let's go.
[08:27.81]I need to start doing more laundry.
[08:29.67]I've got to do some more laundry this year.
[08:33.78]I can't just wait around and like, oh, is this clean?
[08:36.58]Is that clean?
[08:37.20]No, I can't do that.
[08:39.96]It's stupid.
[08:41.30]It's selfish.
[08:42.10]It's annoying to like be like, oh, I don't care.
[08:50.21]And number one is to clean my laundry machine, my washing machine.
[08:54.58]People forget to do that.
[08:58.28]Every like six months, you should really use one of those machine washing packets.
[09:05.89]Oh, and I also want this to be the biggest content year I've ever had.
[09:08.58]Somewhere up there in the top five or whatever.
[09:10.64]I don't know.
[09:12.26]Somewhere up there.
[09:13.72]Oh, this game has a theme song.
[09:17.46]I need to listen to this.
[09:26.65]Let's hear it.
[09:29.46]Is this a real song or is this... Did they make it for this game?
[09:39.71]Is this a real song?
[09:44.35]I don't think this is DMCA.
[09:52.04]I think they made this for Thrillville.
[09:53.86]This is an original song?
[10:00.74]It's a perfect day in my amusement park.
[10:05.39]Be careful, dude.
[10:05.95]This game is a DMCA landmine.
[10:08.03]Oh, whatever.
[10:10.22]This isn't a real song.
[10:11.28]I got my ticket to ride on my rides in my amusement park.
[10:16.34]Nobody made this song.
[10:17.64]Like on an album somewhere for like just a regular releasing it.
[10:21.11]This is for this game.
[10:21.87]Alright, I have a... This is a very important question for everybody here.
[10:29.81]First of all, I got a 1440p monitor now.
[10:31.29]Isn't that cool?
[10:33.75]Alright, shut up for a second.
[10:35.03]Not you guys.
[10:36.63]No, I actually like that song.
[10:40.82]Alright, so, uh, here's, this is really important.
[10:44.86]This game has two different graphics settings.
[10:48.71]One of them is the original, the original PS2 graphics, and the other one is the new, updated Xbox 360 graphics or something, right?
[10:59.27]Everybody that I've seen talk about this game talks about... Is this a real song?
[11:06.71]No, you just spelled Thrillville.
[11:09.17]Of course it's an original song.
[11:12.78]They're saying Thrillville.
[11:13.98]I'm fine.
[11:14.70]I'm DMCA fine.
[11:16.98]Alright, so do you want... Let's see what it looks like with the new graphics, okay?
[11:21.72]There's two different graphics.
[11:22.86]This is the new, updated.
[11:25.03]You pick a character.
[11:25.79]This is what they look like.
[11:33.16]A lot of people said that the old PS2 original models look way better.
[11:36.56]But we're going to be the judge of that.
[11:38.82]Okay.
[11:44.64]So what does it look like with the original models?
[11:48.59]We might have to do a trade-off here though.
[11:52.83]Because I think it makes all the other stuff worse looking too.
[12:00.34]the actual park and the environments and the lighting and everything.
[12:03.14]Let's see.
[12:03.68]I mean, this is definitely a little more charming, I think.
[12:14.35]But, should we play with the original graphics?
[12:22.87]Original, original.
[12:23.73]Do a vote?
[12:24.25]Alright, we get a poll up here.
[12:27.58]Original graphics or updated graphics?
[12:30.56]Scene 2.
[12:30.80]This is an- how- do they have an entire original album?
[12:41.19]How come nobody has ever said to play this OST?
[12:43.29]This is a whole album.
[12:53.44]Whiplash, baby, on that roller coaster.
[12:58.83]Why have I not heard this?
[13:02.60]This is actually ACDC.
[13:03.92]This is not ACDC.
[13:08.35]Alright, well, in the meantime, I can just pick a character, alright?
[13:12.24]Who do I want to play with?
[13:13.88]This whole game is played in a third-person perspective, and you can ride all the rides you make, and the rides are not normal.
[13:20.38]They're like shooting people out of cannonballs and stuff.
[13:23.20]I don't know.
[13:23.56]Who do I want to play as?
[13:28.81]Harry?
[13:33.63]Thomas?
[13:36.81]Jasmine?
[13:38.83]Greg?
[13:39.15]I kind of like Eden.
[13:45.13]Wait, hold on.
[13:48.35]Oliver?
[13:49.09]Bethany?
[13:50.11]Lane?
[13:55.08]Jim?
[13:57.00]Joseph?
[13:58.60]I kind of like Jessica, too.
[14:01.28]Hmm.
[14:01.76]I think it's going to have to be Eden.
[14:08.15]Eden.
[14:13.07]Is this just Ness?
[14:14.29]Alright, appearance.
[14:18.83]Head style.
[14:24.47]It's Eren.
[14:26.67]I can't do that in 2022.
[14:30.63]I like this hair.
[14:32.59]Hair color.
[14:37.08]It's just Lucas.
[14:40.80]Should we make Lucas?
[14:41.56]That's fine.
[14:49.18]Alright, what about clothing?
[14:54.81]I don't think I want to change any of the clothes.
[14:56.07]I like it like this.
[14:56.77]It's Bart Simpson.
[14:57.75]Well, it's whoever.
[14:58.49]I like this.
[15:04.61]I don't want to change anything.
[15:10.77]Edit name.
[15:11.77]Well, it's definitely not going to be Eden anymore.
[15:17.71]It's definitely going to have to be Lucas.
[15:20.82]Lucas.
[15:28.66]Oh, I'm ready.
[15:30.60]I'm ready.
[15:32.95]I can do it.
[15:34.33]I can do it and I can make a lot of you real mad.
[15:36.51]I can go for it.
[15:41.41]Thinking about doing it.
[15:41.97]Thinking about making everybody very furious the first stream of 2022.
[15:45.28]No, that's too early.
[15:53.60]Too early for that.
[15:56.70]I'll probably do it at some point this stream.
[15:57.96]I won't be able to contain myself.
[15:59.11]Alright, you ready?
[16:01.05]Is the soundtrack just play the whole game?
[16:06.51]Original graphics.
[16:07.37]That's what we're going to stay with.
[16:08.35]Sounds good to me.
[16:09.11]Start the game.
[16:09.63]Here we go.
[16:09.99]3, 2, 1.
[16:12.85]Are we little?
[16:17.46]Are we tiny?
[16:17.90]Are we like a... I feel like we're as big as mice.
[16:21.94]Is that what this whole thing is?
[16:24.24]Yeah, we're like mice.
[16:24.98]We're as big as little mice.
[16:26.20]Is this PS2?
[16:26.50]This looks...
[16:40.79]Really good for PS2 FMV.
[16:42.39]This looks great.
[16:42.93]This reminds me of that guy.
[16:44.43]The guy that was in every Disney movie.
[16:47.33]And he found me like this.
[16:49.29]Oh, let me tell you something.
[16:51.21]No, you have to be careful out there.
[16:53.24]He was like the Mad Hatter.
[16:55.22]What was that guy's name?
[17:11.17]This is the Mad Hatter.
[17:12.57]Not Goofy, no.
[17:22.68]Not Rick Sanchez.
[17:24.08]No.
[17:25.36]If you know, you know.
[17:26.22]Okay.
[17:26.42]This is my park.
[17:27.00]I was like, that's dangerous.
[17:28.50]Maybe it's because of the no safety equipment on any of the rides.
[17:31.46]I have a feeling that's why.
[17:51.93]Everything you do in the park creates thrills.
[17:54.85]And if you want, I'll send you out on missions that will help you make more.
[17:59.35]Everything I do is thrills.
[18:02.97]And I can do missions to do more.
[18:04.69]But now let me show you what it takes to be a great theme park owner.
[18:08.11]Make your way over to one of those pillars of light and we'll begin.
[18:11.54]Okay, but wait a minute.
[18:12.98]I own this park?
[18:15.14]And I like ate?
[18:16.12]My stomach is going to start eating itself.
[18:21.09]My stomach is- what?
[18:24.25]Oh my god, that's fast.
[18:25.59]Okay, there's a sprint?
[18:28.79]Is there a jump?
[18:30.21]Oh wait, hold on.
[18:30.77]Alright, build.
[18:33.44]I can build these rides.
[18:47.37]Ed... Ed Wynn was the laughing guy in Mary Poppins.
[18:51.43]Is that who it is?
[18:55.07]He was always a guy that made toys and shit, right?
[18:57.11]He was always a toys guy.
[18:58.28]Like, I'm the toy maker!
[19:00.72]I'm the toy maker!
[19:02.78]Right?
[19:02.94]Now that you're in charge, one of your most important jobs is to build rides and stalls.
[19:11.39]Alright.
[19:11.65]I get build zones.
[19:19.17]Any time you want to build something, simply walk into one of these zones and press the A button.
[19:24.25]Oh, shit.
[19:24.67]Okay.
[19:25.03]How much customization do I have?
[19:27.31]Every attraction requires power in order to run.
[19:29.97]Power?
[19:30.45]This meter shows you how much power each section of your park has left.
[19:34.50]Pay attention to it.
[19:35.50]What if I run out of power?
[19:36.40]Okay, I looked down at the lower left.
[19:40.70]I thought that was a cryptocurrency.
[19:44.48]I was like, what is that?
[19:45.88]Oh, and then I, okay.
[19:46.92]That's like a, that's a Euro.
[19:48.05]I was like, what is that?
[19:53.93]The crypto Euro.
[19:58.74]Alright.
[19:59.10]I get it.
[19:59.44]I get it.
[19:59.74]I get it.
[20:00.52]Can I do USD?
[20:03.86]Alright.
[20:04.18]Tank frenzy.
[20:06.16]The first build mission.
[20:07.02]Alright.
[20:07.22]We need to build tank.
[20:08.27]Wait, can I build whatever I want?
[20:11.54]Sideshow.
[20:12.24]Test your strength.
[20:14.14]Fucking bull.
[20:16.16]Wild Frontier.
[20:20.23]Oh my god.
[20:20.71]Mini Golf.
[20:22.61]Prospector Stakeout.
[20:24.41]What do I do?
[20:24.87]I kind of want to do... How about Luftwaffe 2?
[20:33.60]What is this one?
[20:35.44]Bandito Chinchilla.
[20:38.47]I feel like I heard that name before, and I don't know anything about it.
[20:41.13]Stunt- Alright, how about this?
[20:42.46]Test your strength.
[20:44.82]Oh wait, I have to build.
[20:46.24]Uh... Okay, for the tutorial, I have to do... Uh... Where is it?
[20:52.60]What happened to it?
[20:55.56]Where is it?
[20:55.96]What happened?
[20:59.14]Where is it?
[20:59.68]There it is.
[21:01.48]What happened?
[21:05.60]I can't select any of these.
[21:08.66]Should I just back out?
[21:13.22]He's a loser.
[21:15.93]I can't select any of these.
[21:21.07]Oh, wait, what?
[21:23.17]Oh, I have to build Tank Frenzy.
[21:25.57]I have to.
[21:26.23]I thought it was just saying that you could build Tank Frenzy if you wanted to.
[21:29.69]Okay, so spin it around.
[21:34.24]Does it matter where it is?
[21:40.17]I guess I'll put it right here.
[21:44.11]Oh, shit.
[21:44.59]Alright.
[21:44.89]It's ready.
[21:45.29]Can I actually build a coaster?
[21:46.62]Oh, nice.
[21:57.73]Oh, hell yeah.
[21:59.49]Hell yeah.
[22:00.11]Are people going to die on this stream?
[22:01.49]I hope not.
[22:01.79]Ooh, I can customize even more.
[22:26.85]Okay, cool.

[26:43.93]Sharks have no bones in their body.
[26:45.95]Their skeletons are made of cartilage.
[26:48.62]Okay.
[26:49.24]That means no bones to break, which is great for the shark.
[26:54.74]It's like breathing in gas fumes.
[26:57.76]Who cares?
[26:58.24]They're not lying about blood pudding.
[27:02.06]It really is cooked with blood.
[27:04.04]They're not lying about blood pudding.

[27:24.18]Okay, what's the... Do you know the home run record?
[27:26.96]Wait, what about just chatting?
[27:29.76]We saw Piranha at the zoo.

[27:31.30]We saw Piranha at the zoo.
[27:32.90]They were awesome.
[27:34.39]Those things scare me.
[27:35.53]Okay, a lot of you guys are like question marking and going... If you've ever heard two kids talk to each other, this is exactly what they do.
[27:42.45]They're just little weird factoid machines of things that they know.
[27:45.97]This is exactly how it goes.
[27:49.93]They just say a sentence of something that they know or found out today to each other.
[27:55.59]I don't think they're even listening to each other.
[28:00.61]The new math teacher at my school is really strict.
[28:04.45]I like her.
[28:05.35]At least I can get some work done.
[28:06.77]Didn't like that.
[28:09.14]Didn't like that.
[28:11.33]Lemonade.
[28:12.13]I heard the guy who did Whiplash is playing Lemonade this summer.
[28:15.67]You have a lot of skills for such a little kid.
[28:17.67]You have a lot of skills for such a little kid.
[28:21.27]Uh, really?

[28:27.19]The end boss is huge.
[28:28.09]Have you played Squadron Ace?
[28:29.65]The end boss is huge.
[28:31.03]I haven't tried it yet, but maybe I will soon.
[28:34.29]That's disgusting to me.
[28:35.39]That's an M-rated game.
[28:37.29]Who bought you that?
[28:38.60]Who bought you that game?
[28:39.56]You shouldn't be playing that.
[28:41.66]Hey, spring training starts soon.
[28:43.65]Baseball season is almost here.
[28:45.75]Baseball is my favorite sport.
[28:47.45]Okay, like that a lot.
[28:48.65]What happens when we get all the way up?
[28:50.73]Oh, have you played Tank Frenzy?
[28:51.73]I just made it.
[28:52.61]For all-out action, you should check out the Tank Frenzy arcade game.
[28:56.95]That car back there is freaking me out.
[28:59.01]I feel like this is going to land on everybody.
[29:00.47]I haven't tried it yet, but maybe I will soon.
[29:02.59]Doesn't this kid have to go to the bathroom?
[29:08.57]It went from 62 to 67.
[29:11.00]What's with all those talk radio stations?
[29:13.27]Play some music already.
[29:15.11]I know.
[29:15.75]More music, less talk.
[29:19.53]It's important to eat a healthy diet.
[29:20.79]No, kids don't want to.
[29:22.15]No.
[29:23.29]We have an old cat that loves to sleep in my bed.
[29:25.17]We have an old cat that loves to sleep on my bed.
[29:29.72]Okay, that's enough.
[29:30.94]That's enough, little Lucas.
[29:32.56]Now come over here and let me show you the candy machine.
[29:34.86]Like, how long is this going to go on for?
[29:36.64]Cats are so annoying.
[29:38.40]Why would you let a kid run this place?
[29:43.61]You don't like cats?
[29:44.25]Why?
[29:44.75]What?
[29:45.75]Our school has a really great marching band.
[29:49.96]I can't wait to join my school's marching band.
[29:52.40]I just want to see what happens when you get to the last, the second bar there.
[29:55.90]You all want to know.
[29:56.66]We need to know.
[29:57.72]You should try Stunt Rider.
[29:59.35]It's a great new arcade game.
[30:02.35]I chatted at another park.
[30:04.13]It was pretty good.
[30:05.13]Alright.
[30:05.65]Boop, can we please be best friends?
[30:07.64]Seafood is really great.
[30:08.58]I love to eat fish.
[30:09.78]Seafood is really great.
[30:11.28]I love to eat all kinds of fish.
[30:13.08]My dad catches fish.
[30:14.60]My mom cooks it, and I eat it.
[30:16.66]It's a great system.
[30:18.44]Okay, we're almost there.
[30:20.43]They haven't even asked how are you yet.
[30:22.09]How are you?
[30:22.73]I have to go wee-wee real bad.
[30:25.47]Shit.
[30:28.97]Why are all the rides always broken?
[30:30.89]Who's fixing them?
[30:31.70]Isn't that me talking shit about my own place?
[30:34.81]We had to go on our mini cold dogs.
[30:36.73]I hate cold hot dogs.
[30:37.87]I hate cold hot dogs.
[30:40.23]Cold hot dogs are the worst.
[30:41.53]Yep, we agree with that.
[30:42.51]Alright.
[30:45.19]Whiplash.
[30:45.87]Have you heard the latest smash hit Whiplash?
[30:47.59]Have you heard the latest smash hit?
[30:49.59]Whiplash is... I'm a huge fan of that song.

[30:55.76]Good friends.
[30:56.34]Alright.
[30:57.64]Now go on.
[30:58.28]Get out of here.
[31:03.24]Frogs can throw up.
[31:04.68]They expel their stomachs, use their forearms to dig out the stomach's contents, and then swallow the stomach again.
[31:10.89]Ew!
[31:12.33]She hates me now.
[31:13.47]I'm sorry.
[31:14.61]See?
[31:15.29]That was fun, wasn't it?
[31:17.15]Talking to people is going to tell you a whole lot about how well your park is doing.
[31:25.16]Okay.

[32:00.67]Okay.
[32:00.77]I can fire people?
[32:01.21]Proud pleaser.
[32:01.77]Shake your groove thing by performing Thrillville's Stunt's new theme song with the park's cheerleaders.
[32:07.64]It's good exercise and an even greater way to promote the song.
[32:25.35]Watch the success gauge.
[32:26.91]It indicates how satisfied the crowd is with your performance.
[32:29.04]If it drops to zero, it's game over.
[32:32.36]What?
[32:34.06]Hey, oh god.
[32:35.36]Crap.
[32:37.08]It's... It's an Xbox controller, and you know I'm gonna mess it up.
[32:40.78]Because X is Y. And Y is... You know what I mean.
[32:45.12]Alright, let's go.
[32:52.57]Wait, what?
[32:54.23]Oh, shit, okay.
[33:06.94]Is this a real song?
[33:07.64]Did they make this for Thrillville?
[33:16.07]I feel like this is a real song.
[33:23.95]I don't know.
[33:24.50]Did they say Thrillville in the song?
[33:28.24]Listen up.
[33:28.50]Listen up.
[33:35.87]Thrillville, right?
[33:38.29]This is a real song?
[33:45.28]Is it a... It's a real... This is a real song?
[33:49.98]Oh, whatever!
[33:59.71]Goodbye?
[34:00.27]This is the last stream.
[34:02.05]I don't think this is... I don't think so.
[34:03.59]Okay.
[34:04.21]Okay.
[34:05.60]I don't think so.
[34:06.02]Is this Miley Cyrus?
[34:13.80]Why do I look so sad?
[34:16.36]Alright, I get it.
[34:21.65]So we're not going to ever do the cheerleading missions.
[34:25.55]Alright, cool.
[34:34.88]Now you're starting to get it.
[34:36.41]Even the work at Thrillville is a game.
[34:38.55]And now you also see how we... Alright, final one.
[34:42.17]We're almost ready to begin our playthrough of Thrillville.
[34:45.81]Welcome to the game.
[34:51.90]Playing games and riding the rides?
[34:53.28]Every game and pl- really?
[34:54.14]Every single ride?
[34:55.82]Can I ride my own rides?
[34:56.60]Alright, we have to play Stunt Rider.
[34:58.05]You can perform spectacular stunts in the air, but try to land on your back wheel.
[35:17.66]celebrate lean reverse horn previous music track god lean alright whatever why did this turn into like a newgrounds game big air slow down slow down so
[35:47.54]Alright, I get it.
[35:48.16]I get it.
[35:48.40]This is cool.
[35:51.36]Don't land on your head.
[35:53.22]Oh, I missed the star.
[35:54.26]It's alright.
[35:57.87]Level 2.
[35:58.13]Alright, let's go.
[36:03.65]Oh!
[36:08.03]This is fun.
[36:08.57]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[36:10.63]Don't go too fast.
[36:13.01]Oof.
[36:14.23]That was bad.
[36:17.88]Yeah, there's the game like the trials, right?
[36:24.87]I was always so bad at these
[36:33.33]I was awful at these games, always.
[36:34.73]The Trials games were such a huge thing on YouTube.
[36:39.89]Back in the YouTube days.
[36:41.39]I never played them.
[36:42.19]I never made a video on them, I don't think, because I just couldn't do it.
[36:45.45]It was embarrassing.
[36:46.30]I think maybe there was one.
[36:47.34]I think there's one.
[36:49.12]Give me a break.
[36:57.78]No!
[37:01.75]Get up there.
[37:10.62]Is this Happy Wheels?
[37:13.13]No, this is not Happy Wheels.
[37:14.21]I never played that either.
[37:16.13]Well, I didn't play that for another reason, though.
[37:19.97]I just, I don't know.
[37:20.75]I didn't want to play it.
[37:21.51]And not because I didn't think I was good at it.
[37:23.59]Did I do it?
[37:32.38]Is that it?
[37:34.10]I feel like this was made in LittleBigPlanet.
[37:44.90]Alright, I'm so bad.
[37:49.56]Fry.
[37:50.52]Fry.
[37:55.79]It was made in Flash?
[37:56.81]I'm sure a lot of these probably were.
[37:58.75]Are these minigames, are there a lot of them like this?
[38:04.49]How many games are in the game?
[38:07.97]Dude, your LittleBigPlanet stream sucked.
[38:10.81]I never streamed LittleBigPlanet.
[38:11.84]What are you talking about?
[38:16.09]I've never streamed a little big planet.
[38:21.72]Slow down.
[38:33.45]There it is.
[38:34.31]Alright.
[38:35.17]Nice.
[38:38.28]You did.
[38:39.32]You literally did.
[38:40.12]When did I stream LittleBigPlanet?
[38:42.20]Did it four years ago?
[38:43.50]No, I didn't.
[38:53.99]You forgot.
[38:55.15]I have never played LittleBigPlanet on stream.
[38:57.62]Not a chance.
[38:58.18]It was in 2015.
[38:58.52]I did not.
[38:58.96]Here we go.
[39:18.67]It's time.
[39:19.11]If Rick talked like this, would half of you guys like the show now?
[39:22.81]Alright.
[39:23.49]Oh, he said, why is there an event horizon happening?
[39:48.87]Alright, I now am the park manager.
[39:54.06]I want to talk to, let's talk to Olivia Edwards.

[40:04.46]Well, I'm the owner.
[40:06.86]Thrillville rules?
[40:09.15]It's for you, Mr. Obvious.
[40:10.97]Your attitude stinks, you know that?
[40:20.11]I just got money for that.
[40:21.85]I thought the person just fell down.
[40:24.31]It's too many sounds.
[40:25.05]I don't like how loud it is.
[40:25.97]Alright, I'm gonna ride the roller coaster.
[40:32.96]Ride.
[40:55.68]What?
[40:57.43]What happened?
[40:58.91]What's going on?
[40:59.91]What is this?
[41:00.79]What happened to me?
[41:02.19]Why did I get ejected?
[41:03.85]What happened?
[41:06.59]Oh my god, this is terrifying!
[41:13.92]It's not finished?
[41:15.02]What do you mean it's not finished?
[41:25.69]What?
[41:32.38]Why are we doing this to everybody?
[41:34.00]That's not just happening to me.
[41:37.64]Oh my goodness.
[41:38.36]Alright, well whatever.
[41:39.00]That was kind of cool.

[42:13.64]How do you play Tank Frenzy?
[42:16.96]Keep moving or you'll be a sitting duck for the enemy fire.
[42:21.40]Okay.
[42:22.84]Left trigger, right trigger.
[42:25.00]Left up, right down.
[42:25.72]Whoa.
[42:31.90]Oh, I hate these controls.
[42:32.96]Um.
[42:42.10]What kind of a ride is this?
[42:46.57]I'm shooting people in like a military scenario?
[42:49.41]What's going on?
[42:52.30]This is a fucked up ride.

[45:19.25]Jeremiah, I had a dream about you last night.
[45:20.33]You're the manager of a local toy store, and I wanted to buy a copy of Saints Row 4, but when I opened my wallet, nothing was there, so I decided to try shoplifting it.
[45:28.81]Suddenly, a big siren started blaring, and I was immediately apprehended, and you said to me, nice try, bucko.
[45:33.71]You're going in the fun barrel now.
[45:35.91]I was then dragged to a staff-only door that opened, and everything went black, and I woke instantly covered in sweat, and my bed was filled with piss.
[45:47.39]Thanks for the dream.
[45:52.77]This is really loud, I gotta turn this down.
[46:02.60]Wait, what do you think I was playing?
[46:15.85]Alright, I want to get off the fucking war ride.
[46:19.23]I don't want to ride this anymore.
[46:24.57]I want to take the VR helmet off and get out of the war simulator.
[46:34.36]I'm gonna die.
[46:44.63]Rapid fire?
[46:45.51]Oh, I'm alive.
[46:51.48]Alright.
[46:51.68]Ah, that's better.
[47:04.85]That one is horrible.
[47:11.81]Why am I playing Flash games?
[47:15.83]Well, we're inside of a machine right now.
[47:18.41]We're playing a game inside of the game, in the machine.
[47:22.74]Get it?
[47:27.88]Now I have to pee because you told me that dream.

[47:38.73]Is this a boss fight?
[47:58.19]Where?
[47:59.69]He has to go real bad.
[48:01.17]And I'd say it's probably at like 65 right now.
[48:04.58]Not that high.
[48:04.96]65 maybe.
[48:05.60]Shoot it!
[48:25.97]Imagine you go to an amusement park and you spend the whole day playing the, like, tank kill everybody simulator.
[48:34.68]All of my friends right now are outside riding the rides.
[48:39.08]And I'm just in here trying to get a high score on this machine.
[48:44.80]They all have cotton candy in their hands, funnel cake.
[48:49.37]What happened to Jeremy?
[48:51.33]Oh, he's playing the war simulator still in that, like, weird dark room.
[48:59.32]Does he want anything?
[49:00.96]I don't know.
[49:01.30]I don't think he gets reception in there.
[49:06.08]My techs aren't going through.
[49:24.24]Where's fart simulator?

[49:35.91]What are your opinions on funnel cake?
[49:40.38]I think it's great.
[49:45.38]You can only eat it like once a year though.
[49:47.32]Or twice a year.
[49:52.05]It's amazing.
[49:52.85]It's really great.

[50:46.35]Alright, well, where's Charlie?
[50:47.87]Mechanic, where's the groundskeeper?
[50:52.05]I gotta train this person.
[50:55.53]Wait, what?
[50:58.06]Why do I have a horn?
[51:00.91]Tidy?
[51:04.38]Some items are worth more points than others, so select what you collect carefully.
[51:08.00]What?
[51:11.04]Wash and vacuum.
[51:15.54]What?
[51:15.85]Am I trying to vacuum puke off the ground?
[51:29.12]Ugh.
[51:33.02]This would be so screwed up.
[51:35.48]Why can't I get it?
[51:36.20]Get it!
[51:36.42]Is that it?
[51:43.20]No, there's more puke.
[51:49.43]Wait, come here!
[51:57.69]Get out of the way!
[52:00.39]This place is disgusting.
[52:02.31]Wait, there's no barrels?
[52:08.87]Do reverse suction.
[52:13.79]Pick it up.
[52:14.19]What the hell are you doing?
[52:18.67]Oh my god, pick it up.
[52:20.51]Get out of the way.
[52:23.33]What's wrong?
[52:25.40]Oh.
[52:28.00]You need to level up.
[52:28.64]I have to do that again, right?
[52:33.56]Training 94- Why am I even as- Why am I this character?
[52:35.96]Do I talk to people?
[52:43.22]Not one food stand?
[52:45.61]What's that?
[52:47.49]Ooh, I just got whatever that was.
[52:48.39]Alright, I think that's okay.
[52:51.57]Should I train- Do it one more time?
[52:52.85]Yeah, I gotta level him up.
[53:01.17]You have a ride that drops you from 300 feet.
[53:02.51]Why are you surprised people are puking?
[53:05.89]I do?
[53:06.25]I didn't know that.
[53:14.04]Only clean the puke.
[53:17.24]That is worth more, you're right.
[53:18.22]Okay, yep.
[53:18.88]Good idea.
[53:26.22]It's that parachute ride.
[53:27.30]I want to make a ride.
[53:31.12]Get out of the way.
[53:36.81]It only gives 7,500.
[53:37.31]You're going to do an amusement park IRL stream.
[53:49.93]No.
[53:51.77]No.
[53:52.33]I... No.
[53:54.50]Is there puke in here?
[53:55.14]There's probably puke everywhere.
[54:00.58]You must not leave this area.
[54:02.06]Let's get battlefielded.
[54:11.42]Get it!
[54:12.92]Oh my god, pick it up for the love of god.
[54:18.05]It doesn't matter.
[54:18.45]I just need to level up once.
[54:21.49]Nice.
[54:21.73]So what does that mean?
[54:22.75]Alright, you're at 100 training.
[54:27.01]You're good to go.
[54:33.04]Still got money?
[54:33.69]Alright, all of you freeze.
[54:34.61]Sam.
[54:34.69]I need to talk to you, Sam.
[54:37.21]Thanks a lot.
[54:37.63]Appreciate that.
[54:40.31]Huh.
[54:40.43]Matchmaking.
[54:40.87]Who?
[54:41.03]I don't think I've met anybody.
[55:03.34]Yeah, don't you?
[55:05.30]I just heard an explosion.
[55:15.63]What's happening?
[55:17.65]What's going on?
[55:18.31]Oh, okay.
[55:18.59]People are talking about that one.
[55:19.71]It's really funny, don't you think so?
[55:21.41]Advertise the game.
[55:31.58]Alright, we're almost friends.
[55:34.64]I challenge you.
[55:39.18]Challenge you to what?
[55:41.57]What did I just challenge him to?
[55:45.05]Okay, I thought that said Thrillville fumes.
[55:48.19]What do you mean?
[55:50.43]Like, we're gonna breathe out of a paint can together?
[55:53.11]What are you talking about?
[55:54.49]I thought it said fumes.
[55:58.86]Okay, um... Prospector Putt?
[56:03.17]Which one should I challenge him to?
[56:11.45]The Flumes?
[56:14.30]I don't know how to play Bandito.
[56:19.26]Prospector Putt.
[56:21.32]Alright.
[56:21.92]Judge the power of your shot carefully.
[56:23.40]Sometimes a soft shot is better than a hard one.
[56:26.65]Shoot.
[56:27.19]Flyby scores blimp.
[56:30.30]Blimp.
[56:33.06]Alright, Sam got four on this one.
[56:34.34]Okay.
[56:37.12]Let's go.
[56:37.40]How hard do I have to hit it?
[56:46.11]I don't even... That's 50% power.
[56:48.03]Holy shit, Sam.
[56:49.77]You got five on this?
[56:51.09]What?
[56:51.39]You are awful.
[56:52.69]Well, an eight-year-old is going to show you how to play this game.
[56:57.02]Okay.
[56:58.60]This is greased up.
[56:59.91]Somebody greased it up before I got here.
[57:06.11]I still beat him.
[57:07.53]You get four in the next one too.
[57:08.77]Wow, pathetic.
[57:21.38]So what if I win?
[57:25.49]Do one full power swing.
[57:26.85]I want to beat this guy.
[57:27.61]I don't know what it does.
[57:28.93]Okay, four.
[57:32.67]I think this kid only gets four.
[57:43.58]Oh my god!
[57:45.30]Come on!
[57:45.98]That would have been awesome.
[57:54.91]Get in there.
[58:00.69]Straight ahead?
[58:01.19]Alright, this should be a hole-in-one.
[58:05.88]Hole-in-one.
[58:08.52]Go!
[58:15.07]Alright, I'm currently winning by a lot.
[58:18.87]What does this one look like?
[58:19.57]Alright, we're going off this wall.
[58:21.99]Hard.
[58:26.48]Whatever.
[58:28.42]Whatever, whatever, whatever.
[58:29.16]Let's get it up there.
[58:36.83]It doesn't matter.
[58:37.31]You guys understand that I can literally just swing and miss five times and I'm still in first place?
[58:44.43]It doesn't matter.
[58:44.85]You got four again.
[58:48.08]It's this one.
[58:49.82]Alright.
[58:51.99]Through the tunnel.
[58:54.51]Into the saloon.
[58:55.13]I'm just going to go hard.
[58:56.57]I don't think you can get a hole in one on this one.
[59:03.20]Do it with your eyes closed.
[59:12.98]No.
[59:15.68]No.
[59:18.33]I bet you can't get a birdie.
[59:20.17]Alright, if I get a birdie on this one, what are you gonna do for me?
[59:23.87]What do I get?
[59:24.27]Figure it out, because it's about to happen right now.
[59:27.27]I don't think I still have confidence that I can do it.
[59:42.96]Okay, actually I gotta be careful, because I can't screw this up, because now I'm in trouble.
[59:46.89]Oh no.
[59:47.17]Oh no.
[59:50.56]Uh-oh.
[59:52.64]How many... What am I... How ahead am I?
[59:53.94]Okay.
[60:01.21]How ahead am I?
[60:02.99]I can't screw this up.
[60:13.59]It's gonna be close after this.
[60:16.92]Sink that.
[60:20.08]Alright.
[60:22.01]I'm still fine.
[60:22.97]I'm five strokes ahead of him at this point.
[60:26.11]I would have to literally just throw for fun.
[60:36.26]What do I get for that one, huh?
[60:37.68]What do I get for that one?
[60:38.28]You gonna give me something for that?
[60:50.01]Now it's just BM time.
[60:59.78]I can't even VM.
[61:01.24]I just win.
[61:06.56]Is that too hard?
[61:07.74]Yep.
[61:13.21]So what do I get for being... Okay.
[61:17.57]What do you actually get for doing this?
[61:29.55]You get... It's pride?
[61:30.69]Battle results.
[61:35.05]He's not going to be mad at me, right?
[61:40.07]You're welcome.
[61:41.61]Wow.
[61:42.93]Alright.
[61:43.23]Oh, I know what happened.
[61:46.15]He just let me win.
[61:46.67]Because I'm seven years old.
[61:48.16]Right?
[61:48.28]Okay, I get it now.
[62:00.34]Your posse seems so cool and close-knit.
[62:02.44]Your posse seems so cool and close-knit.
[62:05.88]These explosions, man.
[62:07.40]I don't like these.
[62:08.12]Wow, thank you.
[62:09.74]Oh my god, somebody's dead.
[62:13.43]What happened?
[62:14.55]What happened over there?
[62:16.03]I think my cell phone just started ringing.
[62:17.99]It's like... Like text, text.
[62:24.97]My phone's blowing up right now.
[62:26.49]I gotta get over there.
[62:27.39]I have to go.
[62:27.87]I gotta get over there.
[62:30.89]Holy, what happened?
[62:36.63]Did you do anything fun last weekend?
[62:40.42]Last weekend, my family and I went to my cousin's wedding.
[62:44.30]Okay.
[62:47.67]What about, um, let's go.
[62:49.21]I'm friends.
[62:49.69]We can gossip.
[62:54.49]How about Teen Monthly?
[63:02.37]Another explosion.
[63:03.57]What do you- wait, what do you mean?
[63:07.54]Oh my god!
[63:10.98]I don't know what's happening on that ride, but I think a mechanic needs to go check it out, because... That's not- I don't think that's- that's not good.
[63:27.07]Oh, yeah.
[63:27.85]Actually, the countless people that are exploding in your car ride.
[63:31.13]It's way too fast.
[63:31.95]It goes 140 miles per hour in a track that's designed for about 30.
[63:38.32]It's a little weird, I think, man.
[63:39.16]Will you just be friends with me?
[63:53.37]What do you mean?
[63:53.83]Oh, he's starving.
[63:55.81]I gotta open up a hunger stall.
[64:03.34]Wait, let's ask him about mini golf.
[64:06.18]I need help being a mini golf pro.
[64:07.76]No.
[64:08.56]Trivia.
[64:08.82]Good friends.
[64:20.13]You know how an albatross sleeps?
[64:21.65]Albatrosses can sleep while flying.
[64:23.97]They'll soar through the air at 25 miles per hour.
[64:26.61]I'm not a big fan of birds.
[64:28.31]Oh my god.
[64:29.05]April 15 is National Glazed Spiral Ham Day in the United States.
[64:34.40]Okay.
[64:34.98]Ham is great, if only because it inspired the hamburger.
[64:38.80]Okay, well, you're not very bright.
[64:41.28]Alright, we're good friends.
[64:42.86]That's all that needs to be said.
[64:43.90]And I just want to let you know that I appreciate our friendship.
[64:51.05]Can I ask you, uh... Now that we're friends.
[64:55.09]What do you think is a good idea?
[65:00.22]Right.
[65:01.28]I got you.
[65:01.80]I hear that.
[65:02.52]I hear that feedback.
[65:04.10]I understand.
[65:05.14]And I understand and I thank you for your feedback and criticism.
[65:10.90]I need a food stall immediately.
[65:12.93]Where can I put it?
[65:18.97]I need a food stall right here.
[65:22.13]Carnival ride, stall.
[65:24.23]Alright.
[65:24.83]Balloon stall, coffee stall, fizzy, hat, ice cream, pizza.
[65:27.71]Pizza stall.
[65:31.31]Get it right here.
[65:34.65]Fizzy entrance.
[65:35.88]Right there.
[65:36.26]Everybody get out of the way.
[65:42.22]Alright.
[65:43.64]Pizza stall.
[65:45.86]Play?
[65:49.92]Alright, how much is pizza?
[65:53.07]Alright, pizza's a dollar?
[65:54.51]No, don't think so.
[65:55.03]It's like four bucks.
[65:55.85]Three dollars for pizza.
[66:00.40]How do you play?
[66:01.40]Do I actually make the pizza?
[66:05.02]You want to play vendor tender?
[66:10.54]Rebound your shots off the walls if you haven't got a straight shot.
[66:19.22]Alright.
[66:21.96]What?
[66:23.42]Oh, it's just bust a groove.
[66:25.82]Bust a move.
[66:30.32]You're my favorite employee.
[66:31.90]I haven't fired yet today.
[66:34.65]I gotta chain it together, right?
[66:37.01]That's nice work.
[66:38.37]Eight times multiplier.
[66:39.17]Now go unplug the toilets.
[66:41.39]I'm not... What?
[66:42.63]No.
[66:46.95]Yeah!
[66:49.07]Big chain.
[66:52.02]Is this a Rugrats voice actor?
[66:55.52]Is it?
[67:00.95]It actually might be.
[67:01.75]I think you got it.
[67:02.61]Alright, chain it.
[67:09.03]There it is.
[67:10.97]Thank you.
[67:14.08]Do you get anything for doing this?
[67:15.76]Or is it just a thing you can do for fun in the park?
[67:27.13]Put your cam on.
[67:27.87]No.
[67:29.23]I don't think not today.
[67:31.13]Maybe in like a half hour.
[67:32.05]Maybe in a minute.
[67:33.49]I will put my webcam on in maybe a half hour.
[67:37.27]That is.
[67:38.61]That's Phil and Lil, right?
[67:45.10]Did it.
[67:49.30]You're already here on bottom left.
[67:56.62]I want to do it.
[67:58.06]I want to do the... I can't, though.
[67:59.88]That's a 2021 thing.
[68:00.62]What?
[68:00.88]Okay.
[68:01.04]Why is that such a... What's with, like, the manager trope of, like... Why do managers have to be like this?
[68:24.16]Are you lucky you haven't been fired yet?
[68:28.47]Like, why are they all such shitty people?
[68:38.03]I think management, you gotta make sure that your employees are fucking happy.
[68:42.81]Right?
[68:44.41]Why is it like this?
[68:54.79]I think there are some managers that do it right.
[69:07.45]Yes, some do.
[69:08.09]I don't know.
[69:10.37]I just don't... You gotta like... You can't just be a fucking dick.
[69:20.88]Oh my god, please.
[69:32.54]Managers can be, unfortunately.
[69:34.06]Be easy on Jerma.
[69:39.14]He's never had a real job.
[69:41.97]What do you mean be easy on me?
[69:43.85]What do you mean I've never had a real job?
[69:49.49]What are you talking about?
[69:54.53]Assistant managers... What did you say?
[69:56.87]I'm going to read that.
[69:58.63]Assistant managers tend to be the good ones.
[70:06.13]I can't fire anymore, whatever.
[70:07.09]Here we go.
[70:12.53]I forgot I was watching this live and I tried to skip this boring part.
[70:17.61]I'm just doing a mini game!
[70:19.18]I'm gaming right now.
[70:21.44]Alright, I don't want to do this anymore.
[70:25.98]I don't want to do this anymore.
[70:29.80]I have like two hours remaining.
[70:31.42]I have the entire run time to lower the rings in the top right.
[70:34.64]I don't want to do this anymore.
[70:47.30]Skip it.
[70:47.80]I'm doing well, though.
[70:48.84]Look at how much I'm making a lot of money, I think.
[70:50.64]I don't know what this is for.
[70:51.62]I'm just gonna lose.
[70:59.77]No, I'm not.
[71:00.37]I can chain this together now.
[71:02.25]Check this out.
[71:08.57]Fuck.
[71:20.26]Alright, I lost.
[71:20.98]Alright, so I got that.
[71:24.95]I'm ready.
[71:26.25]I want to make a ride.
[71:27.13]I want to build a ride.
[71:28.01]This is the space over here.
[71:28.97]What should I do?
[71:31.07]What's that?
[71:34.07]I got 15 grand!
[71:35.37]How much money do I have?

[71:54.51]I build a roller coaster?
[71:56.62]Maybe not yet.
[71:57.08]I think I probably have to unlock it.
[72:01.72]This one's really high nausea.
[72:07.28]Thought that was 48 minute duration.
[72:11.47]You can move to the next ville.
[72:18.45]How do I move to the next vill?
[72:21.57]Go finish your existing coaster.
[72:23.33]Oh, is that the one that's hurting people?
[72:25.23]Alright, what do I do?
[72:34.14]Trick out, ride, manage.
[72:38.18]Real date, edit.
[72:40.70]Edit track.
[72:42.96]Okay.
[72:43.08]Okay.
[72:45.00]Oh, it does just go into the air.
[72:46.34]It doesn't end.
[72:54.11]What is whoa?
[73:02.21]What is this?

[74:04.64]Double jump.
[74:08.84]Okay.
[74:09.22]Alright, I have to get in there before anybody rides this.
[74:12.02]Nobody ride this, nobody ride it, nobody ride it.
[74:13.65]I made it go right into the wall.
[74:19.83]Alright, delete this.
[74:24.60]Zoom this out.
[74:25.10]Alright, maybe I should just do track assist and just have it help?
[74:29.24]Would you like to track assist to help you?
[74:32.34]At this point, yeah, I didn't even start this.
[74:33.82]Oh!
[74:40.00]What?
[74:40.70]Yes, I'd like to use that.
[74:43.22]You've completed a track.
[74:45.00]72 thrill.
[74:47.52]I didn't even start this one, so I, of course, I'm just gonna let it get finished.
[74:50.17]Alright, so now people can actually ride this and not die.
[74:51.85]Very cool.
[74:56.53]Alright.
[74:59.74]Saddlesville?
[75:03.52]I gotta build my own?
[75:04.26]Yeah, I need a plot of land where I can build my own.
[75:08.29]Who are these people?
[75:09.13]Hello.
[75:09.67]Hello.
[75:10.57]Hi there.
[75:11.93]Hi there.
[75:12.31]Crashes in Thrillville are like candy, only sweeter.
[75:17.57]Samuel Jackson?
[75:22.10]They're having a steel cage match when wrestling comes to the local coliseum.
[75:25.98]Wait, there's wrestling?
[75:27.34]I like to go to the matches and yell, arm bar, put him in an arm bar.
[75:37.44]Happiness, loneliness.
[75:39.64]This is very odd.
[75:42.28]So he's incredibly happy, but he is peak loneliness.
[75:47.55]Isn't he here with like an entire family?
[75:52.85]What?
[75:54.73]But he's really happy.
[75:55.77]No one likes a messy park.
[76:02.40]I once had an African gray parrot named Salty Joe.
[76:05.60]I found him while walking down the street.
[76:08.12]What?
[76:08.44]Gray parrots have a lot of special needs and are hard to... I just want to insult this person.
[76:18.14]Alright, I need to find a plot of land.
[76:21.30]I got $14,000.
[76:21.46]I'm going to a different vill.
[76:31.30]Go to HQ.
[76:33.00]Oh, I can't.
[76:33.62]You said I could.
[76:35.48]Why'd you lie to me?
[76:42.53]Wait, the lower the lonely bar, the more lonely they are.
[76:46.77]Oh, that's kind of confusing.
[76:50.11]Keep walking?
[76:50.67]Do I have to walk to the other parks?
[76:56.13]Why can't I just ride the train?
[77:05.49]Wait, I'm just here.
[77:07.91]Why would I need to drive the train five feet?
[77:12.38]Coaster.
[77:13.58]Do I get to build it?
[77:17.86]Oh, hell yeah.
[77:18.50]Let's go.
[77:18.94]Coaster.
[77:25.17]Where's the coaster?
[77:32.25]Prospector's Stakeout.
[77:33.77]Oh, that's one of those shooting games.
[77:34.71]That's cool.
[77:37.08]I have to build it.
[77:38.50]Alright, carnival ride.
[77:43.90]Here's a carnival ride.
[77:44.64]I don't think I've unlocked rollercoaster yet, guys.
[77:50.76]My rides.
[77:56.07]I have to level up.
[77:56.79]Yeah, alright.
[77:57.33]I gotta level up.
[77:59.73]I'm very invested.
[78:00.39]Let's go.
[78:06.15]You have to place them at the coaster bits.
[78:08.89]Like here?
[78:09.23]You have to do it on the platform.
[78:17.48]Coaster.
[78:19.78]Which map build you're on?
[78:21.86]Would you like to begin with a tutorial?
[78:25.60]Advanced coaster.
[78:26.16]Now let's cover some advanced techniques.
[78:30.16]I'll show you how to build a coaster by following a design that I made myself.
[78:35.69]As we go, I'll point out some of the tricks I use when designing coasters.
[78:40.08]I've made a lot of these.
[78:41.58]Your job will be to match your track with the gray one.
[78:44.60]when you remember your preview may show many different possibilities sure I've built the starting lift hill for you the most important part of a lift hill is the drop we're gonna have a big drop the drop gives your coaster the speed it needs to reach the end of the track the longer or steeper the drop I know what I know with the thermodynamics is whatever it is I understand aerodynamics green and then place the track alright so we're gonna go like this
[79:12.17]Another piece just like that and now one left now.
[79:15.15]Let's create some air time air time is when you're lifted from your seat It's one surefire to get it time the drop you've just built gives us this move the pre air time until good Now at the top of the bump we want a level move excellent now make a steep slope Okay, now flatten the trip another good way of increasing your coasters thrill rating is to add whoa coaster pieces and
[79:37.65]Whoa, coaster.
[79:38.63]Yep.
[79:39.21]Left bumper.
[79:39.59]Moving parts like the pendulizer.
[79:41.11]What would you ever get on this ride for?
[79:42.35]What?
[79:42.65]Okay.
[79:43.09]Oh, who cares?
[79:43.83]Banking, yep.
[79:44.49]You bank it to the right a little bit.
[80:06.48]a banked turn twists on its side to ease the strain to bank a track piece left there it is then use the controls to bank in the opposite direction try it now now try making a tight right bank turn when your preview turns green place the track yeah I know I bank it
[80:31.58]Alright, thank it.
[80:32.12]Alright, easy.
[80:32.78]Incredibly easy.
[80:33.59]Let's go.
[80:34.31]Let's go.
[80:34.57]I don't want this piece of shit.
[80:36.69]I want to make my own coaster.
[80:39.15]No, I want to build... Okay, thank you.
[80:59.69]Pendulizer.
[81:01.17]Wagon Trail.
[81:01.75]Whoa is high.
[81:02.57]What's we got?
[81:05.99]Hot Rod Stunt.
[81:07.93]Log.
[81:08.23]Maybe a Log Flume?
[81:12.05]Pendulizer.
[81:12.79]What should I start with?
[81:19.41]Wagon Trail.
[81:21.11]Wild Mine.
[81:23.35]Wagon Trail.
[81:23.97]Let's go.
[81:27.88]Alright.
[81:28.18]How do we start this?
[81:31.15]I'm going to say, how much room do I have to work with?
[81:39.27]I think it can either go this way.
[81:40.40]Let's have it go this way.
[81:41.18]Alright, let's start it.
[81:45.92]I can do the whole map?
[81:47.20]Why do I only have 14,000 pounds?
[81:51.40]I need one of those things.
[81:52.85]You know what I mean?
[81:53.45]How do I put that on?
[82:00.83]How do I put on, like, the thing?
[82:04.27]TNT alley?
[82:07.65]Wait, I just... People get on the ride and I just blow them up?
[82:13.74]Okay.
[82:15.14]I need the chain lift.
[82:16.30]Yeah, how do I get the chain lift?
[82:20.68]Is it part of the woe?
[82:26.36]It's just automatic?
[82:28.54]Is it?
[82:36.10]Pull it back.
[82:36.64]No, stop it.
[82:40.86]It looks... It's automatic.
[82:42.55]Alright.
[82:52.43]Okay.
[82:55.25]That's too much.
[83:09.49]There we go.
[83:09.95]That's what I want.
[83:21.94]This way.
[83:22.38]Alright, straighten it out.
[83:25.84]Add a couple of explosions.
[83:26.62]And then we're going straight down.
[83:37.37]Oh, wait.
[83:37.97]Wait, I can't.
[83:50.56]They smash into a wall?
[83:51.82]Have it go into the church?
[83:56.90]Oh.
[83:58.13]It goes right into the graveyard.
[84:04.95]I'm not done yet.
[84:05.59]Now back it up.
[84:12.34]It's gonna be a little higher.
[84:16.02]What is this?
[84:16.60]Safety alert near too many guests?
[84:31.80]How much is this gonna cost?
[84:36.38]I don't have a price for this.
[84:40.50]Can I even afford this?
[84:44.74]Oh, I can.
[84:45.34]Okay, I see.
[84:45.82]On the left.
[85:08.53]I want to just test it.
[85:12.06]Alright, now help me finish it.

[86:09.34]Nice.
[86:09.78]Alright, it's pretty good.

[89:09.31]This is running at a weird frame rate.
[89:24.66]This brings me back.
[89:27.30]Yeah, this is just complete nostalgia bait for all of you guys.
[89:29.79]The reason why I'm playing this is because I know a lot of you grew up with this game, and I knew a lot of you were going to be like, oh my god, he's playing Thrillville.
[89:37.53]What is that?
[89:45.22]Is this Super Frog?
[89:46.94]There's a million games that are like this.
[89:48.36]It's not just this one.
[89:55.42]I kinda like this game though, this is fun.
[89:59.94]I imagine if he touches you it's over.

[90:17.83]Give me the diamond.
[90:22.66]Jump.
[90:26.58]The character is so floaty.
[90:37.87]Hey, just go play Bubble Bobble.

[91:19.07]I'm kidding, I'm kidding, it's six dollars, see?
[91:22.59]It's $6 again.
[91:24.37]Oh, I'm sorry.
[91:25.47]It was a joke.
[91:26.07]I was making a thing.
[91:28.35]It's not expensive anymore.
[91:34.18]I can put a coaster here.
[91:35.06]I can put a coaster here.
[91:36.00]Alright, that's cool.

[92:14.15]$1.50 for a donut.
[92:23.60]Alright, coffee, donuts.
[92:25.88]And then, maybe like a game or something?

[93:32.90]Alright, donuts, coffee.
[93:44.06]Let's go this way.
[93:47.64]Make it $30.
[93:48.26]No one's gonna buy it if it's $30.
[93:49.28]That's a bad idea.
[93:56.19]Alright, let's put something right here.
[94:00.57]About a... Oh, there's already a couple games.
[94:04.72]Let's do stalls.

[94:12.10]Here we go.
[94:12.50]Right on the side.
[94:15.94]I think that's a good idea.

[95:19.16]Astroville.
[95:19.72]Alright, I'm going to pee my pants.
[95:22.47]I'll be right back.
[95:26.28]See you in two minutes.
[95:35.31]I get to use this one more time.
[95:36.41]This is the last time you're going to see this BRB screen, probably.
[95:39.15]Until next Christmas.
[95:45.84]Get a good look at it.
[95:46.56]It's awesome.
[98:11.19]I told you I was going to be quick.
[98:13.15]I'm back.
[98:23.54]Are you using the fall theme and not the winter theme?
[98:29.04]Yeah.
[98:30.26]Am I?
[98:31.14]I like this one a lot.
[98:31.86]I like them all.
[98:33.72]I just kind of picked one.
[98:39.64]Well, you'll hear this again next fall.
[98:44.89]There's gonna be more music from Bloordal, by the way.
[98:47.33]At least in the probably four or five tracks.
[98:50.01]Coming.
[98:52.41]Alright, let's get back.
[98:56.56]Back to what we were doing.
[98:59.12]What were we doing?
[99:02.46]I have no idea.
[99:05.89]Alright.
[99:10.43]Too loud?
[99:11.15]Eh, whatever.
[99:13.52]Alright, let me get nice and comfy here.
[99:15.72]I have to fake friends with somebody.
[99:23.20]Hey!
[99:24.62]Family!
[99:27.69]I require your attention, Mr. Brooks.
[99:29.81]Oh.
[99:31.05]Oh.
[99:43.15]What a little shit.
[99:46.51]I challenge you... Jim Brooks.
[99:53.08]I challenge you to a game of warp speed.
[99:58.86]Good luck.
[100:06.04]Wait, why am I riding on his back?
[100:07.46]What?
[100:07.70]This is weird.
[100:08.60]Oh, no, I'm not.
[100:09.10]Okay.
[100:10.41]What?
[100:10.63]This is weird.
[100:11.73]How do I play?
[100:14.97]What's going on?
[100:20.20]This is weird.
[100:22.72]I don't even know what we're doing.
[100:23.74]I'm just going to copy him.
[100:27.73]I think he knows what he's doing.
[100:30.35]This is up.
[100:31.01]Hold up.
[100:35.79]Okay.
[100:37.82]What the fuck is all this?
[100:51.14]Good.
[100:51.60]Alright, I just took him over.
[100:55.42]Jeez.
[100:55.78]My woe level's pretty high.
[101:03.32]Alright, I want to get off.
[101:13.69]I want to get off right now.
[101:14.51]There's 25 more seconds left.
[101:24.53]Where did he go?
[101:25.83]Where is he?
[101:26.47]Oh, it's spinning.
[101:35.31]I don't like it.
[101:36.45]Okay.
[101:37.17]I think I just lapped him.
[101:42.43]That guy was Toad in Super Mario Kart Bowser level 1.
[101:48.30]You pass that motherfucker every time.
[101:51.51]I'm sorry.
[101:52.48]I have to give you a gamer opinion here.
[101:54.52]If you are not lapping Toad in the Super Nintendo Bowser's Castle level, just return the game.
[102:03.50]At that point, right?
[102:09.89]Alright.
[102:10.55]Add it to my crowd.
[102:11.59]Should I give Jim a VIP pass?
[102:14.81]Yes.
[102:17.13]What does this do?
[102:18.21]Whoa.
[102:18.71]Alright, so now what?
[102:20.33]What do you think about the park?
[102:27.03]Alright.
[102:28.63]How'd you hear about us?
[102:31.68]Alright.
[102:44.62]You should try- No, I wanna- I'm gonna make a coaster that's guaranteed to kill somebody and I'm gonna tell him he should ride one.
[102:50.07]Have a nice day.
[102:50.51]Alright, I gotta remember what it says.
[102:54.01]Jim.
[102:58.77]My crowd.
[103:00.81]Molly Noodles.
[103:02.83]Jim Brooks and Sam Lee.
[103:04.73]Sam Lee still has not gone to the bathroom since the very beginning of the game.
[103:08.86]Remember this kid?
[103:12.23]He was looking for a bathroom and he said he was starving.
[103:14.45]That was an hour ago.
[103:20.86]Just fucking unfriend this kid.
[103:29.00]Alright.
[103:29.24]Do you even have toilets?
[103:33.83]Yeah, in another park.
[103:35.05]I think this is the only bathroom.
[103:41.88]New mission.
[103:42.38]Robo.
[103:42.84]Oh, wait.
[103:43.06]I have to do missions.
[103:44.06]I completely forgot about missions.
[103:47.12]Oh, my God.
[103:48.30]This is why I don't have any money.
[103:49.48]Alright.
[103:49.72]Guest.
[103:50.96]Robo love.
[103:52.80]Robots don't understand flirting.
[103:54.92]It messes with their logic circuits.
[103:56.36]Use matchmaker.
[103:58.44]Matchmake mode on a teen you are friends with and put some smooth flirtation moves on some of those tin heads.
[104:07.28]Wait.
[104:07.94]What do you want me to do?
[104:14.16]Do I even have any friends?
[104:19.12]So wait, I'm supposed to introduce two people.
[104:29.19]I don't understand.
[104:29.95]Become good friends with a teenager and then use matchmake mode to flirt with robots.
[104:33.81]That's a very weird sentence to say out loud.
[104:44.27]Right?
[104:47.11]Okay.
[104:47.97]Um.
[104:51.44]I can't do that one.
[104:54.22]Robo losers.
[104:56.14]Nothing fries a robot's circuits faster than losing.
[104:59.60]Challenge every robot you see to play a game and then show them the agony of defeat.
[105:03.42]Alright.
[105:05.30]I gotta challenge a robot to a game and just absolutely just wipe their asses.
[105:12.65]Uh, how about 1996-8?
[105:15.25]I am a robot.
[105:22.51]It's on.
[105:23.87]I challenge you to a game.
[105:26.11]Losing not in unit database.
[105:28.59]Unit accepts.
[105:30.53]Alright, warp speed.
[105:31.29]I'm not playing that one again.
[105:32.31]Robo KO.
[105:33.03]We're going to beat you at your own game.
[105:37.74]Repeatedly hitting the same part of an opponent's body will cause their armor to fall off.
[105:43.04]So it's up, down, left, right.
[105:44.72]Punches, hooks, block.
[105:45.96]Block is left trigger.
[105:46.98]Uppercut is right trigger.
[105:48.88]Alright, just punch him in the face as hard as I can.
[105:50.86]Choose your boxer.
[105:53.14]Clink, clonk, or clunk.
[105:55.38]Clunk.
[105:56.56]I'm definitely a clunk.
[105:58.12]Oh shit, clunk mirror match.
[105:59.25]This is bad.
[105:59.65]What's going on?
[106:17.15]I can't even hurt each other.
[106:17.83]I gotta get an uppercut.
[106:29.32]No mercy!
[106:29.92]No mercy!
[106:30.42]No mercy!
[106:36.60]No mercy!
[106:43.81]Get that armor off!
[106:44.71]What the hell?
[106:57.10]walking oh what are you gonna play the game he's gonna block in the corner I win yeah that's an exposed he's exposed bottom left that's what that's my moves I'm doing whoa wait what
[107:30.72]I have combos!
[107:42.23]Will you do something besides just sitting in the corner?
[107:44.05]Nice, good work.
[108:00.13]Throwing the towel?
[108:02.31]You're talking about... That's what... That's what he should do.
[108:04.35]Alright, well, whatever.
[108:07.09]I win.
[108:07.49]I'm gonna get that... I'm gonna get the fame for it.
[108:10.46]You're killing this guy.
[108:13.02]It's third round.
[108:13.64]It doesn't matter.
[108:14.34]He's done.
[108:20.64]Alright, I'm gonna knock him out.
[108:33.61]I'm gonna just do that combo over and over again.
[108:38.31]He just never blocks the uppercut.
[108:39.67]Ever.
[108:40.65]He never blocks it once.
[108:43.28]You're gonna stop.
[108:43.70]You've already wiped their ass.
[108:45.20]You've already wiped their... whatever.
[108:55.49]I need to get a knockout, right?
[109:01.20]I'm just going to tell you guys right now, if I was ever a boxer, every single competition is going to end in a knockout, even if it's me.
[109:06.83]I'm never going to block a punch.
[109:08.67]I'm just going to go in and just be like... I'm just going to swing wildly, do windmills and shit.
[109:12.64]I'm just going to try to hit them in the head as hard as I can.
[109:16.08]And even if I get knocked out, I guarantee it'll be a show worth watching.
[109:20.97]Like, I'm just going in there with hands up, and I'm just swinging at their face as hard as I can.
[109:25.45]Over and over again.
[109:26.17]And they'll catch me in, like, a quick little jab to the chin, and I'm going down immediately.
[109:30.72]But guess what?
[109:32.84]If I knock them out... Oh, I'll knock them out every time.
[109:38.70]I'll do a bunch of, like, weird movements and shit, too.
[109:42.46]I will be the worst person to box against.
[109:44.01]You would never be able to know what I was going to do next.
[109:47.23]I would do, like, weird, like... Jerk!
[109:49.78]dancing moves and stuff in the corner.
[109:52.14]I'd get booed.
[109:52.72]People would throw shit at me in the ring.
[109:54.64]I don't care.
[110:03.08]If I knock them out, I'll knock them out every time.
[110:04.95]Yeah, that's what I mean.
[110:06.03]Like, I'm only going to end fights and knockouts.
[110:10.23]There will never be a scenario where it goes to decision.
[110:13.87]I'm going to be like 4 and 60. 60.
[110:18.34]You know what I mean?
[110:19.10]Like, you'll know what's going to happen when I get on stage.
[110:24.55]Imagine knowing that.
[110:25.25]Imagine knowing that the guy that's in the card next will always end in a knockout.
[110:30.72]You just don't know how.
[110:36.50]That would probably be bad.
[110:43.75]I wonder how he's going to get knocked out this time.
[110:46.73]You'd be the first mini-boss of boxing games?
[110:56.55]Gabby J. Yay, yay.
[111:11.42]I'm the guy that everybody just starts cheering when you're on your second or third beer to rile the crowd up.
[111:17.33]I'm just the clown that comes out and does a bunch of goofy shit and then gets knocked out.
[111:22.65]How barbaric.
[111:25.31]That's not fun.
[111:27.12]That's barbaric.
[111:31.24]Kill him!
[111:31.86]Kill his ass!
[111:35.03]And I like run around the ring.
[111:35.91]I'm like, oh, whoopsie.
[111:38.73]And then the guy just fucking rocks me.
[111:41.41]And I go down for 10 seconds.
[111:45.37]And everyone's just screaming, like spilling their beers all over him and shit.
[111:48.41]I don't think that's a bad idea for boxing.
[111:51.41]I believe that pizza is the best food ever.
[111:57.14]I would just be like a clown.
[111:58.84]Court jester.
[112:07.22]I disagree.
[112:07.80]I'd watch it if it were, like, old wrestling.
[112:09.66]You don't like pizza?
[112:14.18]Come on, man.
[112:16.00]What do you mean?
[112:17.42]Alright, well, I won.
[112:18.72]I get my trophy, right?
[112:21.23]That was a thousand bucks.
[112:22.95]Robo losers awarded.
[112:26.41]I gotta do more of the missions.
[112:29.97]Too expensive?
[112:30.63]What do you... What?
[112:31.71]It's... How much is this?
[112:33.07]Alright, fine.
[112:34.80]We'll go in the other strategy and that's make sure it's so cheap that every single person can afford it.
[112:39.37]Everybody can buy it.
[112:40.97]So eventually I'll make a profit.
[112:49.07]You're gonna die in the ring.
[113:02.48]That's not how it works.
[113:05.37]Okay, if 100,000 people buy a balloon for 25 cents, or if 50,000 people buy a balloon for 50 cents, what are you talking about?
[113:14.30]It's the same.
[113:24.99]Put it back to 175, fine.
[113:26.51]It's the same amount of money gained.
[113:34.81]King of math.
[113:35.59]If you sell a hundred thou- Okay.
[113:37.47]If you sell a hundred thousand balloons for one cent, or you sell fifty thousand balloons for two cents, you've made the same amount of money.
[113:49.09]It's the same amount.
[113:51.13]Make it a dollar.
[113:57.47]What do you have cost per paloon?
[114:02.59]Paloon.
[114:04.98]Wait, wait, wait, what's this?
[114:05.74]Why do you have a trophy?
[114:08.82]Oh, it's Molly Noodles.
[114:10.72]Oh.
[114:10.88]Do you have any hints?
[114:13.20]I gotta go.
[114:13.72]Alright.
[114:13.94]Sparkle Island Plus?
[114:14.68]We're already doing Plus?
[114:33.06]I don't want to do that.
[114:34.00]I don't want to do this.
[114:35.22]Why would I sign myself up for this?
[114:37.26]What do I have to beat?
[114:38.02]Five?
[115:01.79]No, no, no, no, no, just go, go, go, go, go, go.
[115:05.31]It's got candy.
[115:14.94]What?
[115:19.41]Hurry up, hurry up before the thing comes.
[115:22.59]How many, how many Fios do I have to rescue?
[115:32.04]Should I just farm the fruits?
[115:33.82]I think that's probably a good idea.
[115:35.90]I think.
[115:39.68]Monkey Island.
[115:40.40]Oh, yeah.
[115:41.72]This game was published by LucasArts, right?
[115:52.73]What happens if I win this?
[115:56.54]If you sell one balloon, that's one dollar, and you sell it for one dollar, you get zero dollars.
[116:02.37]But if it's two, you get one dollar, so that's profit.
[116:04.57]But you don't know how much the balloon takes to make.
[116:09.07]Why are you assuming that it takes a dollar in cost to make the balloon?
[116:12.97]You're assuming that.
[116:13.71]We don't have that information.
[116:15.35]It could be one cent.
[116:20.09]Neither do you.
[116:24.91]Will you play Hitman PC for VR?
[116:27.45]Whoa, wait, hold on.
[116:28.33]Everybody stop moving.
[116:29.33]Everybody hold on.
[116:30.35]Will you play Hitman VR on PC when it comes out on the 20th?
[116:32.87]Is that going to line up perfectly for all the VR shit that I want to do?
[116:37.46]Are they actually coming out with that?
[116:38.54]I remember it was a PSVR thing they did.
[116:40.40]Remember how angry I was that it was PSVR only?
[116:45.74]I'm absolutely going to do that.
[116:46.86]Yeah, I mean, you can 100 million percent expect that.
[117:06.79]Yeah, so, the plans over the next couple weeks.
[117:10.45]Uh, I'm gonna set up the VR.
[117:12.15]I don't know if I'm gonna do it immediately.
[117:13.73]We'll probably do one more stream where I'm not in VR.
[117:16.59]Like this weekend.
[117:18.27]And then, oh shit.
[117:21.40]FIRE THE- I was waiting for the fire, cause I thought it was gonna- Look at how long that takes.
[117:35.69]Whatever.
[117:42.93]Alright, so... What?
[117:44.87]What was I saying?
[117:48.29]Okay.
[117:49.15]Right.
[117:50.29]So... I just shit out a bird.
[117:59.72]It's so floaty.
[118:01.68]You have to give me some slack.
[118:02.66]Alright.
[118:07.86]Alright.
[118:09.97]So we'll probably do something this weekend.
[118:12.83]And then after this weekend, I'm going to set the VR, the big giant VR room again.
[118:18.11]We'll do VR for a couple of weeks.
[118:20.55]Then there's going to be something that you probably don't want to miss.
[118:24.57]That last week of January, maybe the first week of February, I'll give you a hard date, but I'll make sure to let you know you probably don't want to miss it.
[118:30.03]I would probably make sure I was there when I give you that hard date.
[118:36.69]Not baseball.
[118:39.22]Baseball's going to be in the spring.
[118:43.25]Something else.
[118:44.43]But it's going to be very fun, I think.
[118:45.77]I hope.
[118:46.03]I think it's going to be very exciting.
[118:50.21]But that'll be the last week of January or the please don't drop.
[118:53.75]There we go.
[118:59.00]It'll be within that few weeks.
[119:01.26]January into February.
[119:05.00]Don't let this one just sit up here.
[119:07.14]Nothing even touched me.
[119:11.77]By the time I get this all done, this girl's not even going to be in the park anymore.
[119:14.37]Why am I even doing this?
[119:16.99]Oh my goodness.
[119:26.32]Fire.
[119:29.82]That's a lot.
[119:32.63]Doing it for Molly.
[119:33.49]I think there's only one more.
[119:41.93]Is it like a... No.
[119:43.23]It's not a Catboy stream.
[119:50.91]It is a large event.
[119:52.21]That's all I will tell you.
[119:54.21]That's it.
[119:54.58]You're not getting anything else out of me.
[120:03.02]This is not Thrillville.
[120:04.04]Yes, it is.
[120:05.66]When do I get to stop?
[120:06.82]I don't want to play this anymore.
[120:08.12]Molly, please.
[120:12.68]I have no more lives left.
[120:13.58]Did I win?
[120:21.21]Oh, I did it.
[120:24.95]It was fun rescuing.
[120:27.09]I'm laughing because your challenge was a joke.
[120:29.13]No, I want to be friends.
[120:30.05]Sparkling plus, I got it.
[120:43.61]Alright, do you have anything else you want me to do?
[120:44.71]You got a gold thing on you.
[120:45.81]What's that?
[120:46.07]Wait a second.
[120:48.27]Why don't you like me?
[120:50.05]Wait, hey, I want to talk.
[120:51.35]Why don't you hate me?
[120:52.11]Alright, what other missions do we got?
[120:53.79]Upkeep.
[120:53.93]Mechanical marvels.
[120:54.41]Balloon tender.
[121:15.03]Metallic balloons.
[121:15.75]An interview with the robots.
[121:16.75]I don't care about robots' circuitry.
[121:19.03]Build.
[121:20.01]Busted.
[121:20.45]Build a coaster the longer the better and then break it.
[121:25.17]Wait, what?
[121:30.55]Globo Joy robots are so stupid.
[121:33.51]They'll go on any ride they see and I'm trying to hurt them?
[121:36.59]I'm trying to kill them?
[121:39.69]Make a coaster crash.
[121:42.33]I think I have enough money to do it.
[121:43.27]Let's do it.
[121:47.45]Or is there a coaster one?
[121:48.27]Right here.
[121:53.76]Park upgrades.
[121:56.74]Do more research.
[121:59.68]Marketing.
[122:01.92]Research.
[122:04.04]Earnly $100 spending.
[122:06.90]I can do $300.
[122:07.26]You have to kill them.
[122:15.55]I mean, I'm about to.
[122:21.69]Alright, where's this coaster?
[122:22.55]I can build a racetrack, dude.
[122:24.75]No, coaster, coaster.
[122:25.63]Let's go.
[122:25.97]Build my own.
[122:30.49]Ooh, a dinghy.
[122:32.45]Yep, we're doing a dinghy.
[122:33.43]Alright, the direction's gonna go this way.
[122:39.53]What have we got for whoa?
[122:42.93]Ooh.
[122:43.17]Ooh.
[122:49.24]Wait, this is just supposed to crash.
[122:50.40]Why would I waste any money?
[122:51.24]Just dump them right here.
[122:53.65]Just dump them into... Right?
[122:59.99]Why not just dump them?
[123:08.25]Let's go up first.
[123:10.17]I need length first.
[123:11.19]Oh, okay.
[123:14.17]How do we get them out of the game map?
[123:16.11]So they actually can never come back.
[123:33.86]Out of bounds?
[123:36.72]Oh, that's fine.
[123:37.34]Yeah, I want to make sure that they actually can never come back.
[123:42.07]This would be out of bounds, right?
[123:51.78]that'll throw them far enough where they get out of mounts read the mission wait wasn't it eject them into the parking lot it needs to be hot they need to have more fun
[124:19.72]Alright, let me actually make something that's not a straight line up and a straight line down.
[124:22.60]That'd be nice.
[124:26.65]You need to build a ride with 1400 feet of track that kills them.
[124:31.20]Oh, okay.
[124:31.46]Okay.
[124:43.97]Alright, then let's start here.
[124:45.39]Let's have it go back down through it, like thread and needle.
[124:50.02]That'd be kind of cool.
[124:55.12]Okay, now let's add a woe factor.
[125:23.10]I don't want to be that far.
[125:24.02]There we go.
[125:32.32]Add the pretzel.
[125:35.98]You're gonna get decapitated?
[125:37.10]You're gonna be alright.
[125:40.26]And I'm gonna shake the fuck out of him.
[125:49.48]And it's supposed to crash, right?
[125:57.74]Crash directly into this tree.
[126:01.38]How far is it?
[126:01.88]Do I have any indicator how far?
[126:05.14]Backspeed 86 miles per hour.
[126:08.04]Length 1500.
[126:09.13]Alright.
[126:12.09]This should work.
[126:13.31]I think that's good to go.
[126:18.01]Let's go.
[126:22.33]Stop building.
[126:24.03]If you stop building now, your coaster will crash.
[126:25.73]Yeah, well that's what I'm supposed to do.
[126:30.22]Alright.
[126:30.44]Should I try it?
[126:34.08]Let's try it.
[126:35.92]That looks... Actually, this kind of looks like a water slide instead of a water park.
[126:54.57]Where am I?
[126:56.51]Oh, there I am.
[126:59.43]Water does not go up like that.
[127:00.91]I thought it was the same clip again.
[127:02.61]Go first person?
[127:05.23]Alright.
[127:09.28]Oh, here we go!
[127:15.38]Oh!
[127:18.86]That was kind of cool.
[127:20.26]Maybe do it again.
[127:35.88]Alright, it's perfect.
[127:38.20]I wouldn't ride this, though.
[127:40.18]People are riding this?
[127:42.50]I thought I made this to kill robots, not kill people.
[127:48.95]Before you go on there.
[128:06.88]Shit.
[128:07.16]Can they even make it back over here?
[128:12.76]I don't think they can make it back.
[128:13.64]Balloons for the kiddos.
[128:17.28]Why is this crashing every five seconds?
[128:20.88]There's too many people on this.
[128:26.48]Okay, but what is... What happens if I hurt too many people?
[128:29.60]Hey, kids.
[128:32.50]Want some balloons?
[128:38.60]You're not thinking, alright.
[128:39.76]So, am I doing this right?
[128:43.90]Build.
[128:45.59]Busted.
[128:46.61]Oh, I got it.
[128:47.15]Okay.
[128:50.85]With this one, stick it to those rascally robots by building an incredible mini golf course that will foil the robot's logic circuits.
[128:58.00]Wait a minute.
[128:59.94]What?
[129:01.46]I can build my own mini golf course?
[129:11.14]Excuse me.
[129:16.40]Excuse me.
[129:17.48]Really?
[129:19.26]Let's put it right here.
[129:19.76]I'm going to put a hamburger stall right next to it.
[129:26.38]What?
[129:26.66]I can do my own mini golf course?
[129:33.76]Oh my goodness.
[129:34.70]Okay.
[129:41.97]No way.
[129:42.59]Alright, that's hole 1.
[129:45.93]This is hole 2.
[129:50.03]Okay.
[129:58.99]Alright, now hole 3.
[130:56.22]Can you get a hole in one in this?
[130:57.60]I don't think so.
[130:58.93]Stop, stop, stop.
[131:00.03]What?
[131:01.15]Come on, I'm having fun.
[131:02.23]People are going to get stuck on this forever.
[131:14.74]No way.
[131:18.84]It's going to take three hours to do this.
[131:22.60]I don't want to play this.
[131:28.74]Should I try it?
[131:32.58]Wait, I gotta do a paint job on it.
[131:39.24]Oh, I kinda like blue.
[131:41.06]No, it's ugly.
[131:41.58]Um, I don't want the red though.
[131:47.10]I want... I don't like it.
[131:49.92]Okay.
[131:53.04]Oh, here we go!
[131:53.54]They're actually gonna play.
[131:57.46]I'm very curious.
[132:00.04]Get out of the way, camera.
[132:00.78]Stop it.
[132:01.08]I want to see.
[132:01.46]Let's see how they do.
[132:03.35]Hole in one.
[132:05.35]Nice.
[132:07.63]On to the second hole.
[132:09.53]This one's a little trickier.
[132:11.25]Because you have to go forward with it.
[132:14.77]Yep.
[132:15.09]Nice work.
[132:16.40]Pretty good form.
[132:19.66]On to the next hole.
[132:20.20]What about Ted here?
[132:24.82]Ooh, did you get it?
[132:26.52]Nice.
[132:28.62]Very nice.
[132:30.45]Good luck.
[132:39.78]Realizing what you've done.
[132:41.88]Realizing you maybe shouldn't have played.
[132:48.61]Good.
[132:50.29]Where'd you get it to?
[132:51.73]Right there.
[132:52.13]That's one shot.
[132:57.36]Nice.
[133:01.02]It's gonna be quite a bottleneck.
[133:09.72]This queue.
[133:11.35]One person an hour can play this.
[133:13.19]It's gonna be like a 20-stroke course.
[133:16.07]Alright, everybody out of the way!
[133:16.91]It's my place!
[133:17.65]I wanna play!
[133:23.93]Alright.
[133:25.25]I got a bet for you.
[133:25.99]Can I complete my own mini golf course in less than 20 strokes?
[133:36.59]20 strokes or less.
[133:41.82]Here we go.
[133:43.24]You want to bet?
[133:45.22]No, no, no, no.
[133:45.74]Way more than that.
[133:47.12]30 strokes or less.
[133:48.08]I'll do the whole thing.
[133:53.75]Predictions.
[133:54.21]Let's do it.
[133:54.65]I think I can do it.
[133:58.29]I don't think you guys understand my strategy that I'm going to employ here.
[134:02.00]You don't know the strategy.
[134:03.16]Go ahead.
[134:03.56]Bet against me.
[134:04.54]Do it.
[134:05.54]Can I do this whole course in 30 strokes or less?
[134:15.33]You said 20.
[134:15.91]Yeah, then I corrected it before the poll went up.
[134:18.01]30 or less.
[134:23.10]Good luck.
[134:23.94]I hope you vote correctly because I am going to show you something very special.
[134:32.18]Okay.
[134:34.24]Another few seconds.
[134:36.06]Or you'll give 5,000 subs.
[134:37.62]That's not going to happen, so no.
[134:43.21]Let them all vote.
[134:52.56]30 strokes or less.
[135:00.01]Okay.
[135:00.13]Here we go.
[135:01.33]Good luck.
[135:04.11]That's one.
[135:07.37]Really?
[135:08.57]Two.
[135:09.03]That's so easy.
[135:10.29]Oh, my God.
[135:11.29]Don't.
[135:12.19]Alright.
[135:13.53]Two.
[135:17.96]Three.
[135:19.50]Alright.
[135:19.80]We're good.
[135:20.14]We're good.
[135:25.53]Here we go.
[135:28.15]Just a straight shot.
[135:29.20]Oh, please.
[135:31.08]Was that three?
[135:31.74]Four.
[135:35.84]Five.
[135:48.69]Six.
[135:51.22]And seven. Here comes seven. Motherfuckers, you didn't think I was gonna skip the whole goddamn course?
[136:15.09]Yes! Hahahaha.
[136:24.09]You all lose. You all lose.
[136:26.95]Never bet against me again.
[136:29.59]Okay.
[136:44.00]Dude, alright.
[136:44.78]I got 11 under par.
[136:45.90]That's game over.
[136:46.90]Congratulations to those who actually understood what I was doing there.
[136:53.41]I did that in less shots than it took to do the first hole.
[137:00.68]I didn't... All I told you was I was going to complete this in under 30 strokes.
[137:07.23]I didn't tell you how I was going to do that.
[137:08.63]I just got 85,000 points.
[137:22.91]Oh, goodness.
[137:23.45]Alright, so now what do I want to do?
[137:27.17]How much money do I have?
[137:27.85]Only 3,200 bucks.
[137:29.04]How?
[137:31.92]My wife is going to kill me.
[137:39.20]Escape drop coaster?
[137:41.85]Alright, we have to have a really crazy escape drop.
[137:44.21]So let me understand what's going on here.
[137:47.65]We're trying to get rid of the robots.
[137:50.34]And to get rid of the robots, we have to make rides that are incredibly dangerous.
[137:55.00]So they leave.
[137:56.14]But in the process, we're going to kill thousands of actual parkourers.
[138:04.63]Okay.
[138:06.07]What?
[138:10.05]Hello.
[138:10.85]Initiating.
[138:11.47]Do you like hockey?
[138:14.35]I'm holding an exhibition hockey game in an arena close to my house.
[138:19.47]Do that again.
[138:20.01]I was scared.
[138:20.93]No, I don't have to do it again.
[138:21.81]I already did what I was going to do.
[138:24.11]A crushed lizard and ratchet bandicoot.
[138:27.48]Thanks for the 20 community subs each.
[138:28.96]Thanks a lot.
[138:31.44]Appreciate it.
[138:32.08]That's a lot of money.
[138:32.82]Thank you.
[138:33.82]Alright, I can't be friends with these people.
[138:39.29]I don't think they like me.
[138:44.27]These robots don't... I can't make my friend me to go up.
[138:48.75]Wait, I want to jump on the trampoline.
[138:57.14]Oh, a backwards left-right jump trick.
[138:58.78]One, two.
[138:59.78]Ooh.
[139:01.66]Alright.
[139:12.69]This is kind of scary.
[139:19.09]Does anybody else feel like the trampoline is kind of just bad for your organs or something?
[139:23.35]I feel like your stomach is going down to where your groin is.
[139:39.65]Ooh, that was on the head.
[139:40.55]He's alright.
[139:58.28]Wait, did you say 18th century way of thinking or something?
[140:00.88]What do you mean?
[140:01.50]Like, because I don't know how organs work?
[140:04.76]Do that again.
[140:05.48]I want to do it again.
[140:22.87]Oh!
[140:22.93]Here, put olives on all your fingers for 10 million off the debt.
[140:25.81]Oof.
[140:32.44]Weirdest comment I've read all day.
[140:33.82]How do I have olives?
[140:46.21]Why are you assuming that I have a jar of olives in my house?
[140:51.53]Olives?
[140:56.20]That was fine.
[141:00.83]don't have olives in I don't have olives in my fridge alright last try
[141:24.01]Go buy olives.
[141:25.69]Okay.
[141:27.03]The next stream you see, I will put olives on my fingers and go into the camera and go like, with all my fingers with olives on them.
[141:37.24]Okay?
[141:38.42]Is that what you want to see?
[141:39.18]Because I'll do it.
[141:43.72]He landed on his feet.
[141:58.52]I landed on my feet!
[142:06.48]It was always... If you ever went on a trampoline, it was always really embarrassing.
[142:09.12]Because I was always the guy... I could do the backflip on a trampoline, right?
[142:16.83]It was like, no way, man, you could do a backflip?
[142:18.55]Oh, whoa, no, it's awesome!
[142:19.71]Have you ever screwed it up?
[142:23.23]Have you ever, like, landed, like, on your butt?
[142:24.89]It was, like, a huge embarrassment.
[142:28.08]Because you're supposed to be the guy that can do that.
[142:30.14]You're supposed to be the person that can do that, and you didn't.
[142:34.43]Everyone's just kind of like, oh, nice try, I guess.
[142:38.01]Like, no, no, I promise I can do it.
[142:39.25]I promise, I promise.
[142:43.25]What a dangerous thing to have.
[142:46.19]The trampoline is incredibly dangerous.
[142:53.92]I need to clean this place up.
[142:59.68]I almost have a level up, though.
[143:00.60]This is cool.
[143:01.12]Alright.
[143:02.30]Guest.
[143:03.80]Robo losers.
[143:06.68]Critic Mo Pots is saying he's going to write another bad review of Thrillville now that robots are running amok in the park.
[143:14.10]Why don't you see about giving him a gift?
[143:15.70]Preferably something he likes that'll keep his mind off of writing.
[143:18.38]Alright, what do you look?
[143:22.46]What do you like?
[143:23.06]Huh?
[143:23.22]Huh?
[143:30.66]Positive you're fair and honest.
[143:31.74]You want a present.
[143:34.58]Okay.
[143:34.70]Okay.
[143:47.56]Is this Bart Simpson?
[143:48.32]How many?
[143:48.64]How many?
[143:49.08]Pop a walk, creep.
[143:49.86]You get bupkis.
[143:51.27]Or maybe there is something I can do for you.
[144:18.06]Maybe there's something I can do for you.
[144:20.02]I'm glad we can agree to agree.
[144:21.50]So what present do you want?
[144:22.83]A nice sideshow prize would be great.
[144:24.81]Sideshow prize.
[144:25.17]I can take it home and show it to the family.
[144:27.15]And pretend like you got it?
[144:31.51]You want to have the prize where you can prove to people that you got at least 60 or 70 on the test of strength?
[144:38.48]Because you can't do it on your own?
[144:42.22]You can tell people that you did because they know that's where the prize came from?
[144:45.18]I understand.
[144:45.66]I'll be right back.
[144:46.32]I get it.
[144:46.64]I get it.
[144:49.78]Okay.
[144:51.20]You won a prize.
[144:59.65]This place is awesome.
[145:00.95]Whoa, I want to play the basketball game.
[145:04.39]Oh, that's Robo KO.
[145:05.55]I want to play the basketball.
[145:10.25]Is there no basketball?
[145:13.68]How do I play that?
[145:16.64]Um, that looks like fun.
[145:18.24]How come I can't do that?
[145:24.41]It's just a decoration?
[145:25.30]Oh.
[145:31.14]What was I doing?
[145:31.68]There's money just over here.
[145:41.05]What is this?
[145:41.59]Is this another decoration?
[145:44.11]This place is crazy.
[145:46.77]Oh.
[145:49.73]Oh.
[145:54.38]I need to build... Okay, I have to build the drop coaster.
[145:58.31]Yeah, okay, I gotta find a place to build a coaster.
[146:00.29]And it has to be horrible.
[146:01.19]Like, terrifying, scary, and hurt people.
[146:03.49]Is there a place for a coaster here?
[146:10.84]No, we gotta go back.
[146:17.90]Upkeep.
[146:18.74]I haven't done any of these.
[146:23.32]I forgot about the bribe.
[146:24.84]Oh, right, right, right, right.
[146:25.90]How do I get a prize?
[146:28.57]How do I even get a prize?
[146:29.51]All the games I've played haven't had any prizes.
[146:37.43]Am I left?
[146:38.61]Oh, right here.
[146:45.22]Alright, here we go.
[146:48.90]So it needs to be one of these drop rides.
[146:51.14]Flying coaster...
[146:55.87]Uh, what was it called?
[146:57.29]I'm gonna sneeze.
[147:01.03]I couldn't mute fast enough.
[147:02.84]I'm sorry.
[147:03.88]I really did try.
[147:04.70]Another 25 subs from Addy.
[147:11.38]Thank you, Addy.
[147:12.50]Actually, more than that.
[147:13.14]Like, 35.
[147:13.32]You guys are giving me a lot of money today.
[147:16.14]Unnecessary.
[147:16.58]Don't do this.
[147:19.40]You don't have to give me any money.
[147:21.48]Thank you.
[147:24.74]We're, uh, racetracks?
[147:26.08]Isn't this thing a dropper?
[147:32.19]Oh, here's an escape drop.
[147:39.97]Alright, let's go.
[147:43.11]This is just one of those, like, Tower of Terrors?
[147:44.39]I'm gonna have it go this way, because there's more room over here.
[147:51.32]Alright, so this is a... It goes up, and then...
[147:59.65]I'm going to put it at the very beginning.
[148:04.27]Let's do loop, loop, loop, loop, loop.
[148:21.27]I think loop at the beginning.
[148:23.89]Then... I'll go through the fire.
[148:30.08]I need five drops.
[148:32.38]I don't have enough real estate to do that.
[148:34.54]I barely have enough room for one.
[148:35.78]So I have to just do this five times.
[148:48.61]I don't want to spin it.
[149:07.20]It counts as a drop, right?
[149:12.77]Alright, come back this way.
[149:20.71]This variety needs to be named Big Chungus.
[149:25.14]I don't think it has to be named that.
[149:26.48]But I'll consider that name.
[149:39.97]Okay, there's one, two.
[149:41.75]This is crazy.
[149:42.71]This is not a bad one.
[149:48.43]This is pretty cool.
[149:53.27]The stats on it.
[149:53.89]82 thrill.
[149:55.21]I gotta make it really, really horrible, right?
[150:00.98]Let's get it back up then.
[150:07.54]Oh my goodness.
[150:08.12]What am I thinking?
[150:09.00]Hold on.
[150:10.70]Wait, I can just go straight down?
[150:14.70]That would be awful.
[150:15.52]Too much, too much.
[150:27.28]Too close?
[150:48.81]No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[150:54.50]Oh, it's a corkscrew.
[150:55.34]Oh, that would have been a cool end.
[150:58.62]Come on, really?
[150:59.22]Alright, just help me finish it.
[151:05.48]Drill 100, nausea 79.
[151:07.20]This thing is awful.
[151:07.86]Let's check it out.
[151:26.95]This is going slow.
[151:31.56]I'm just hanging people upside down.
[151:32.96]This is not going fast.
[151:45.30]Okay, was that just to get you ready?
[151:49.31]Why is it going so slow?
[152:00.12]It just puts a bunch of blood to your brain.
[152:07.81]Why is this a hundred thrill?
[152:09.41]Is it going to actually move now?
[152:19.62]Guys, this is going straight downhill.
[152:30.92]It's not on slow mode?
[152:32.42]There's no such thing as slow mode.
[152:51.25]The whole thing is just a powered track.
[152:58.75]The whole thing is chain.
[153:02.19]What?
[153:05.43]Where's the drop?
[153:18.28]Okay, so this ride, we just hang people up.
[153:19.84]Alright, whatever.
[153:20.52]They're not going to want to ride it.
[153:26.80]Okay, end the ride, please.
[153:32.28]They're lining up ready to go.
[153:35.18]They want to ride it.
[153:36.34]Alright, Will.
[153:36.96]Cool.
[153:38.86]What did I do wrong there?
[153:45.80]I did everything wrong?
[154:04.76]Somebody has a big plan to stop Thrillville?
[154:09.10]New minigame in party play.
[154:10.68]Sparkle Island Classic.
[154:11.60]Do you wish to view your new trophy?
[154:13.20]No.
[154:13.36]Alright, good luck everybody on this ride.
[154:17.98]I hope you like it.
[154:18.92]I think all the robots are coming here.
[154:20.56]Alright, I definitely got that mission for sure.
[154:31.55]That skill rating's not high enough?
[154:33.21]Alright, there we go.
[154:36.06]Alright, I ain't got a... Games.
[154:43.32]Some coaster types are slower than others.
[154:44.82]Yeah, not... That's going as fast as traffic goes on a highway.
[154:49.69]It's like 5 miles per hour.
[154:50.77]Alright, I need to... I gotta get this guy a present so I bribe him.
[155:01.59]I got $100 for doing that.
[155:04.65]It's not worth doing that.
[155:08.10]Alright, I gotta find a prize.
[155:09.48]Do I have anything in my inventory?
[155:10.66]Paranoid Android.
[155:21.43]Manage.
[155:21.77]Teen Dream.
[155:26.25]Alright, I've got 75 teenagers here.
[155:28.11]I need to get rid of robots still.
[155:38.28]Alright, buy a... I gotta get a balloon or something.
[155:41.34]Is there a balloon stall somewhere?
[155:42.38]Okay, I gotta go this way.
[155:44.76]Let's go to Oceanville.
[155:45.44]Where are my friends?
[155:53.65]VIP pass.
[155:56.45]Uh, Tim Twinklefingers.
[155:57.75]I don't even know who this is.
[156:01.06]Remember Molly Noodles?
[156:02.94]Mo Pots.
[156:03.74]Alright.
[156:04.34]Should I give him a pass or something?
[156:10.03]Let's teleport to Mopots.
[156:15.27]Alright, can I give him something?
[156:21.42]You get prizes from minigames, not vendors.
[156:26.94]Yeah?
[156:27.16]Alright, I gotta go get a prize then.
[156:37.39]Go watch Bionicle with him.
[156:41.41]Ooh, this is cool.
[156:49.17]I need two more Lindsay's Notes.
[156:50.78]What do I get with that?
[156:53.56]Alright, I gotta get some more attractions.
[156:55.26]And some more money.
[156:59.68]I need to get a... I need to get some... Something here.
[157:02.91]Pizza.
[157:05.11]I need to make money.
[157:05.99]Food, let's go.

[157:12.61]Hats I Need a sideshow game put one right here one more Lindsay's notes, and I'll get Lindsay's notebook Alright, where's test of strength is it a stall I
[157:44.25]Is it a game?
[157:44.90]Okay, running cost.
[157:52.38]Ticket price.
[157:55.32]Mini golf.
[157:55.88]I don't see any of those midway games anywhere.
[157:59.61]Oh, sideshow.
[158:00.51]Okay, alley ball.
[158:02.47]Coconut shy.
[158:03.39]Alright, let's do alley ball.
[158:08.33]It's not a bad spot for it.
[158:15.09]See if I can win a prize.
[158:17.10]Judge the strength of your throw carefully.
[158:18.60]Alright.
[158:21.98]Oh, it's skee-ball!
[158:27.92]What?
[158:38.63]What the fuck?
[158:39.41]Why do I have full power?
[158:41.15]Take it down!
[158:43.03]How do I take off full power?
[158:48.39]How do I take power down?
[158:56.64]Buttons?
[158:59.32]I'm at max power.
[159:01.24]I don't know how to put it down.
[159:02.02]That one doesn't work.
[159:04.44]A, B, nothing works.
[159:14.45]I don't want to be on max power.
[159:15.97]The trigger buttons.
[159:18.02]It's not the trigger button.
[159:19.14]Nothing worked!
[159:27.28]Full power.
[159:28.78]I don't get it.
[159:29.70]Right click?
[159:34.38]Why did that go down?
[159:35.48]I don't understand this at all.
[159:40.04]I don't get it.
[159:40.50]We just have to work with it.
[159:50.60]You're flicking too hard.
[159:55.22]It's about the speed of going forward.
[159:58.70]Good luck trying to get that to work right.
[160:02.62]I have to flick softer?
[160:04.44]There is only one speed on flick.
[160:07.62]It's flick.
[160:12.43]There is not slow flick.
[160:13.93]It's just flick.
[160:15.39]It's forward.
[160:19.93]How much do I need for the prize?
[160:20.91]Oh, come on.
[160:27.59]Do it again.
[160:28.19]Pull back, then push forward to throw.
[160:49.77]Come on.
[160:52.65]Oh my god, it's impossible to do this.
[160:54.79]Because you have to aim in different other directions.
[161:02.10]I can't even throw it in another direction.
[161:05.64]I'm trying to go to the right.
[161:10.71]This is impossible, man.
[161:22.58]I'm leaning so far in.
[161:32.50]Get in there!
[161:36.16]Get in!
[161:45.68]All clear, there it is.
[161:52.63]I'm starting to understand this stupid minigame.
[161:55.61]It's still dumb.
[162:04.42]Please.
[162:06.84]You can't go to the right or left.
[162:09.04]You can't do it.
[162:10.32]This is not possible.
[162:11.06]You can't do it.
[162:19.21]I'm trying to do it so slowly.
[162:22.75]I just did that so slow.
[162:28.12]There's not much slower I can go.
[162:30.96]This is all based on the dead zone of the controller you're using.
[162:33.74]Alright, I got the prize.
[162:34.80]Let's go.
[162:35.14]High score.
[162:36.16]Did I get a prize?
[162:41.18]Nice.
[162:42.12]Table, tennis, bat.
[162:44.49]Where's eight?
[162:54.99]Where is he?
[163:01.02]Where are you?
[163:01.44]Where is he?
[163:05.88]Where is he?
[163:07.39]Oh, my crowd.
[163:07.85]Alright, dude.
[163:11.25]Let's go.
[163:12.75]Give me a good review.
[163:17.40]It's review time.
[163:20.53]It's review time.
[163:21.31]Alright, I'm positive you're going to give a good review.
[163:22.95]You got it.
[163:23.71]I'll be like table tennis.
[163:24.89]Or give you a VIP pass.
[163:26.57]Here, here's a bat.
[163:27.35]Hell yeah.
[163:55.12]They're still playing this.
[163:58.50]All these, this is really scary looking.
[164:00.06]All these robots are waiting for this kid to be done?
[164:06.92]Is that the couple that first was here at the very beginning?
[164:14.84]They're all waiting for these little kids.
[164:23.90]Absolute hell.
[164:26.76]You guys enjoying the park?
[164:32.82]Hi.
[164:34.36]Who are you?
[164:35.72]I own this place.
[164:37.70]I'm the park manager.
[164:39.04]I'm the new park manager.
[164:41.14]No way.
[164:42.42]That is really great.
[164:43.34]Oh, the tone really changed quickly now, didn't it?
[164:51.09]It is, but riding roller coasters all day makes me dizzy sometimes.
[164:56.23]Alright, here, you want a VIP pass?
[164:58.87]Here, I want you to have this.
[165:01.69]This is a really cool present.
[165:04.10]Alright, now we're best friends.
[165:05.54]So now, I want to ask you a bunch of questions.
[165:10.16]I want them answered immediately.
[165:11.92]Hey, spring training starts soon.
[165:13.94]Baseball season is almost here.
[165:15.92]It's stupid that they call the playoffs the World Series.
[165:18.95]All the teams are in the United States and Canada.
[165:25.06]it's true alright how about uh trivia wait how do you think the part could be improved oh I don't know it's alright as is I guess no no it's not good enough that's not good enough
[165:52.48]You can't just say, oh, it's alright.
[165:54.30]You got to tell me what you think.
[165:55.38]I really like it here.
[165:57.06]Alright.
[166:00.06]What about your kids?
[166:01.22]How are your kids doing?
[166:05.64]Bradley Adams, Sarah Adams, Emily Adams, all the Adams family.
[166:09.05]Alright.
[166:10.93]How's Sarah Adams?
[166:12.65]Hello.
[166:13.85]This park is great.
[166:14.97]Good.
[166:20.35]Okay.
[166:23.68]I challenge you to a duel.
[166:26.22]Alright.
[166:29.10]Mini golf.
[166:30.18]On my course.
[166:37.76]Can I do it on my course?
[166:41.59]Or is it gonna be... I don't know.
[166:42.87]Is it my course?
[166:43.97]I don't think it's my course.
[166:59.33]Good luck.
[166:59.93]I want to see how many strokes she has Alright hole in one Okay, she got four strokes on hole two Not bad so far
[167:23.86]Alright, I'm gonna probably laugh pretty hard if it's over 100.
[167:26.10]It's gonna be probably like 60.
[167:33.85]Dude, please.
[167:37.75]I'm of the opinion that, alright, this should be a circle.
[167:42.40]Two or three inches around this hole.
[167:44.42]That if you just get it in that circle around the hole, then it counts.
[167:47.86]Does it matter?
[167:49.47]It should be, there should be a small, like, target around the circle.
[167:53.03]And if it leans onto the lip, it should count.
[167:56.43]Okay, call it, like, it's like golf with the bumpers, like bowling.
[167:59.78]I don't care.
[168:00.26]I would rather play it like that.
[168:01.18]Alright, she had 19 strokes.
[168:06.04]It's a par 19.
[168:07.14]She had, she got 19 strokes.
[168:16.67]I'll get it.
[168:23.55]Uh oh.
[168:23.79]Uh oh.
[168:29.37]Uh oh.
[168:38.15]I gotta find the right spot.
[168:41.73]That's good enough.
[168:52.57]Too hard.
[169:00.52]Stroke 11.
[169:01.04]I'm okay.
[169:03.31]I win.
[169:10.75]We're good.
[169:17.35]You see what I'm saying?
[169:19.06]Just have a thing here with bumpers on it.
[169:21.20]I win.
[169:30.46]You're welcome.
[169:35.60]One more game.
[169:36.08]We're going to do escape drop.
[169:40.68]No, I don't want to do it.
[169:41.44]I hate this one.
[169:42.22]Back out.
[169:42.74]I quit.
[169:43.32]I forfeit.
[169:44.28]I heard pirates have taken up residence in Oceanville.
[169:51.90]We thought we chased them away, but they just moved to Scurvyville.
[169:55.33]That's pretty dumb.
[170:00.56]She's happy.
[170:01.14]She's happy.
[170:01.70]She's having a good time.
[170:02.28]She's very hungry though.
[170:09.88]Warp speed.
[170:12.02]No, what?
[170:12.86]I don't want to do this one either.
[170:13.92]Forfeit.
[170:22.85]Alright.
[170:24.55]What do you think?
[170:25.07]A kid will give you a real opinion.
[170:29.53]Okay, good.
[170:30.25]Good.
[170:32.52]Have a nice day.
[170:33.00]Alright, I need to figure this out, too.
[170:42.75]So... I need to, like, do matchmaking.
[170:48.55]That's, like, part of the game.
[170:49.41]Why does she hate me?
[170:50.53]Why won't she... Wait, I can't talk to...
[171:02.20]I need to do... It said matchmake with a robot, right?
[171:04.60]Okay, so how do I do that?
[171:13.89]It was just to complete a challenge.
[171:16.89]How are you guys doing?
[171:22.89]Alright.
[171:23.65]Jake Lopez.
[171:24.55]What's up?
[171:26.10]How you doing, Jake?
[171:27.02]Alright.
[171:30.24]Thanks.
[171:35.54]Um, matchmake.
[171:37.10]How about... What do you think about the, uh, alley ball?
[171:41.16]You can get some cool prizes.
[171:41.98]What park?
[171:42.40]Who stole my idea?
[171:43.16]Somebody took it?
[171:51.54]Alright.
[171:51.84]I don't think this kid's going to be into a fishing tournament.
[171:54.57]How about trivia?
[171:54.99]Hahaha.
[172:22.96]Uh, hot body?
[172:24.10]This is young Sheldon.
[172:26.66]Okay.
[172:26.84]Running that park was very difficult for me.
[172:53.12]My friends would always come to the park and give me criticism.
[172:56.88]I'm way harder than that.
[172:58.28]I did know plenty of information.
[173:01.42]The National Hockey League was the first professional sports association to allow a woman to play in one of its games.
[173:07.82]It's great.
[173:08.34]We're best friends now.
[173:24.83]I met a girl who would be perfect for you.
[173:27.41]You should ask her out.
[173:30.01]Sure, why not?
[173:31.07]Alright.
[173:34.18]What?
[173:35.18]It's me.
[173:36.70]I don't know who that is.
[173:44.02]Greetings.
[173:45.77]I am a robot.
[173:52.45]Hey, did you do hockey, man?
[173:54.35]Did you know this?
[173:55.69]Did you know this, man?
[173:57.26]Hey, did you know all this info?
[173:59.74]I love singing.
[174:03.06]I love playing basketball.
[174:05.28]I'm a big tennis fan.
[174:06.78]Everyone says it was our class that drove.
[174:15.33]I find that pizza is nature's perfect food.
[174:17.59]Do you agree?
[174:19.68]Unit just wants to be friends with creepy human.
[174:24.36]Oh.
[174:31.09]How am I supposed to do this?
[174:35.33]Greetings.
[174:36.29]Unit offers greeting to human.
[174:38.15]What would a robot like?
[174:47.47]You're like cotton candy.
[174:48.79]So sweet.
[174:51.09]Error.
[174:52.63]Error.
[174:57.03]Be friends first?
[174:57.87]I can't make any... How does this even work?
[175:06.96]Hey.
[175:08.08]Hello.
[175:08.56]Oh, this is a person.
[175:12.06]The space wave trip video is so freaky.
[175:14.56]I love it.
[175:15.72]It's one of my favorite videos.
[175:18.43]Favorite band?
[175:18.99]OK.
[175:22.71]Alright.
[175:40.80]How about piranhas?
[175:41.98]Should I give facts?
[175:44.30]How about new puppy?
[175:46.20]This is an AI-generated conversation.
[175:48.98]Yeah, it is.
[175:49.58]Because it's two AIs talking to each other.
[175:52.24]Created in a video game with pre-scripted dialog.
[175:55.02]So you're absolutely correct.
[175:56.22]They're all robots.
[175:59.06]Okay.
[175:59.28]What about penguins?
[176:00.60]Okay.
[176:10.45]I didn't like that.
[176:11.01]What about hamsters?
[176:12.37]I got two hamsters as a birthday present, and now there are 27 of them.
[176:16.86]What?
[176:17.12]A hamster once peed on my head.
[176:19.72]How?
[176:24.62]Monkeys have to be one of the smartest animals on the planet.
[176:27.36]Put a hat on you, and you'd be a Dead Ringer for a monkey.
[176:30.04]Oh, okay.
[176:33.19]Ow.
[176:34.33]Ouch.
[176:36.04]Have a great day at the park.
[176:38.44]That was painful.
[176:39.50]I felt that one.
[176:40.74]That was painful.
[176:54.19]Is this person here with a family?
[176:56.29]I guess it's looking over here.
[177:06.70]Do you like penguins?
[177:07.84]I love to see penguins at the zoo.
[177:10.32]I wish I could pet a penguin.
[177:11.90]Alright.
[177:12.62]Okay.
[177:13.06]You like penguins?
[177:14.04]Very cool.
[177:14.46]What about piranhas?
[177:15.94]Nah.
[177:16.66]Too much.
[177:19.36]Barbecue.
[177:19.98]Everybody loves a good barbecue.
[177:21.53]I went to one last week.
[177:23.49]There's something so great about eating something hot and fresh off the grill.
[177:27.79]Okay.
[177:28.13]What about spicy food?
[177:29.57]You can't go wrong with spicy foods.
[177:32.61]I love spicy food.
[177:34.99]Chicken wings, jambalaya.
[177:36.38]What is he saying?
[177:37.12]He's just trying to talk to me.
[177:39.88]Did you catch the game last night?
[177:41.44]It was an awesome display of skill.
[177:43.92]It was a great game.
[177:45.32]I loved every minute of it.
[177:48.58]Okay, I got an old cat.
[177:49.81]I love cats, and I'm not afraid to admit it.
[177:55.59]You like rhinos?
[177:56.35]What's it called?
[177:57.43]Animals.
[177:59.39]The horn does make the rhino look sort of ridiculous.
[178:03.80]Alright, um, what about seafood?
[178:06.13]I love to eat fish.
[178:07.19]Seafood is one of my favorite foods.
[178:08.89]I grill tuna steaks on the barbecue.
[178:11.05]With some spices, it's like there's a party in my mouth and everyone's invited.
[178:15.83]Okay.
[178:18.74]Last weekend, we went to the steakhouse and had the most amazing... Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[178:22.52]We like food.
[178:23.32]We get it.
[178:23.76]So how do we... How do I... I just made friends.
[178:27.42]I did... Okay.
[178:28.80]I did that wrong.
[178:29.58]That was... It's gotta... Alright.
[178:31.43]How about... Um...
[178:34.71]I need some- That was an adult.
[178:43.61]Oh.
[178:45.19]Um, are you gonna call me a monkey?
[178:46.81]Okay.
[178:46.93]What about pets?
[178:47.43]Okay.
[179:04.60]You like hamburgers?
[179:05.28]Wait!
[179:05.64]It's a robot!
[179:06.12]I can do- Oh!
[179:07.02]I just want this stupid trophy!
[179:36.76]Oh, I remember you.
[179:46.23]Addy just gave 50 community subs.
[179:48.15]Oh my god.
[179:49.69]That's too much.
[179:51.99]That's insane.
[179:55.07]Thank you.
[179:55.55]Too much.
[179:56.19]Way too much.
[179:56.75]I don't like anything.
[180:05.67]Okay.
[180:06.09]Well, do you like hamsters?
[180:07.07]Oh, did one pee on your head one time?
[180:09.11]I love to pet hamsters.
[180:10.51]They're very cuddly.
[180:13.41]English is my favorite subject, and I really like going to English class.
[180:16.60]I hate doing lessons on grammar and punctuation.
[180:19.18]Okay.
[180:21.56]What about... I got tickets.
[180:23.12]I saw them live last year, and they're excellent.
[180:28.53]Alright.
[180:29.01]Do you know any languages?
[180:31.25]My Spanish is terrible.
[180:32.67]I don't think it will
[180:34.86]Okay.
[180:35.54]Do you like spicy food?
[180:36.92]I don't like hot foods.
[180:38.96]I always have to drink a ton of water to put out the fire in my mouth.
[180:41.84]Well, that's your problem.
[180:42.82]What you should be doing is have a glass of milk and don't swallow the milk.
[180:45.50]You swish it around in your mouth and spit it out.
[180:48.46]Milk will... With the enzymes in milk will help break down the spiciness of the food.
[180:53.58]But if you swallow it, you don't want to swallow it.
[180:59.25]Because it goes down.
[181:01.89]Food on a stick is better than food off the stick.
[181:05.82]Milk ruins the fun.
[181:08.50]Are you... I'm telling you that... I think I learned that from Alton Brown.
[181:18.52]Who is way smarter than you when it comes to food.
[181:21.55]Irma likes Alton Brown?
[181:28.25]Yeah.
[181:28.73]Yeah.
[181:35.72]I've seen all of his shows.
[181:38.40]You have to really practice to become good at basketball.
[181:44.70]I'm training to compete in a hot dog eating competition.
[181:46.66]How am I going to... Alright, we're almost friends.
[181:48.60]I guess.
[181:48.82]The hot lunches are all pretty good.
[181:59.28]Who doesn't like Alton Brown?
[182:01.38]I know.
[182:01.66]Oh my goodness.
[182:04.10]I'm about to leave.
[182:04.86]It's just random.
[182:05.90]We'll get it eventually.
[182:13.55]I know.
[182:26.70]Okay.
[182:28.16]Hey, we go to the same school.
[182:29.24]We should hang out.
[182:30.80]You don't even have a fishing pole, and I'm hooked.
[182:33.37]Oh my god, fucking delete that from your vocabulary forever.
[182:37.17]Whenever someone yells, free bird, our band plays that song.
[182:41.03]Okay.
[182:42.29]Normally, I wouldn't go out with someone cuter than myself.
[182:44.33]Fucking get rid of that.
[182:45.09]Delete that from your vocabulary.
[182:46.67]I'm in a band.
[182:47.20]We're called the Bloody Snowmen.
[182:48.58]Delete that.
[182:50.62]He's all bad.
[182:51.92]I love to dunk the basketball when I'm playing for my school team.
[182:56.28]That's a stupid, annoying flex.
[183:00.16]Uh... We go to the same school we should hang out.
[183:03.68]I mean, we go to the same school... These are all terrible.
[183:10.94]What?
[183:19.59]I know, uh, I have a talking parakeet.
[183:22.44]Why would I pivot to prison food?
[183:24.34]Well...
[183:49.07]I just want the trophy to the mission.
[183:54.22]Alright, Mark.
[183:58.00]I don't know.
[183:58.90]I just want to complete the mission, which is have a teenager.
[184:06.27]Go have a romance with a teenager or something.
[184:08.83]I'm just looking for the mission completion.

[184:44.95]Now what?

[185:07.09]Less junk, more healthy foods, they say.
[185:08.71]Yep.
[185:08.85]I like eating healthy food like fish, turkey, chicken, and vegetables.
[185:14.35]Yeah.
[185:16.03]One of my friends got a new puppy and it's... I like to hold puppies.
[185:19.17]Good.
[185:19.57]Okay.
[185:20.01]What about rhinos?
[185:21.77]I'd like to go on a safari and see a rhino in the wild.
[185:24.17]Okay.
[185:28.01]I don't... Everybody loves a good barbecue.
[185:29.73]I love it when they drench chicken in barbecue sauce and grill it up.
[185:37.35]I don't know.
[185:37.69]I feel like it's kind of a weird pivot to go from like, oh, I love animals.
[185:41.79]I love animals.
[185:42.49]I love animals.
[185:43.29]Grill up those fucking turkeys and smother them in oil.
[185:46.79]I feel like this is kind of weird.
[185:48.17]This is a weird conversation.
[185:52.69]We saw a bunch of piranha at the zoo.
[185:54.49]Wait, that's all we've talked about.
[185:55.77]I wonder if piranha would eat a bus or something.
[185:59.71]I'd love to learn how to cook.
[186:01.15]Cooking is one of the most useful...
[186:02.94]Alright.
[186:03.30]Do you like lemonade?
[186:05.30]You know the song Whiplash?
[186:06.98]The singer is playing lemonade this summer.
[186:09.02]You do know the song is about a rollercoaster, right?
[186:11.64]That's so lame.
[186:13.82]Ugh.
[186:14.26]That's lame?
[186:16.24]What's your favorite subject in school?
[186:17.30]Which is my favorite subject.

[195:55.31]Oh my god.
[196:00.27]I don't think I can... How do you even do that?
[196:15.56]How do I flirt with a robot?
[196:18.48]This is weird by itself, by the way.
[196:20.75]Hey.
[196:21.51]Hi.
[196:26.63]I'd love to learn how to cook.
[196:28.51]What about your world famous pasta, though, man?
[196:30.46]Oh, yeah, world famous pasta.
[196:33.94]Cross-circuiting to me.
[196:35.36]Stand by.
[196:39.01]I can't do any of this.
[196:40.01]They don't care about anything.
[196:41.75]Is there one that just works?
[196:43.55]Great humor.
[196:44.17]Broom.
[197:11.53]I would think the alien invasion one would be... Right?
[197:15.01]Prison food?
[197:17.61]Has to be an adult woman.
[197:24.47]No, it's not.
[197:25.53]What are you talking about, man?
[197:29.17]What are you talking about?
[197:30.19]I was going to...
[197:45.15]I don't... I need to look at this.
[197:46.68]I need to look this up.
[197:49.66]Robo losers.
[197:53.02]Robo love.
[197:58.78]Oh, I just have to do it three times.
[198:02.17]I thought I had to have a robot like girlfriend or boyfriend or something.
[198:07.29]I thought I had to actually like go out with a robot.
[198:19.10]Okay, well I got 7,900 bucks.
[198:20.88]It's time to make some coasters.
[198:28.50]I got some new rides to do.
[198:31.23]Let's put one right here.
[198:33.49]A lot of people are hungry, so it's time to get more pizza.
[198:37.91]Too many people at the park are hungry.
[198:45.63]Pizza, donuts...
[198:53.30]Okay.
[198:54.94]And maybe some water?
[198:56.24]Oh, yeah.
[198:56.70]People are thirsty, too.
[199:01.62]Okay.
[199:02.16]They can stay at the default prices.
[199:03.16]It's fine.
[199:03.52]Alright, missions.
[199:09.22]What do we got?
[199:10.70]Games.
[199:11.46]Questing 101.
[199:16.81]I don't want to do that.
[199:20.37]Do some crazy stunts.
[199:24.98]Tim Twinklefingers claims he's the best alleyball bowler in Thrillville.
[199:28.88]Oh, let's go show him up right now.
[199:31.59]What's going on, Twinklefingers?
[199:32.53]Hi there, I'm the park manager.
[199:34.09]I'm Tim Twinklefingers, the alleyball wizard.
[199:37.07]It's the weirdest way to introduce yourself, but that's fine.
[199:42.35]I think you're less of a wizard and more of a sorcerer's apprentice.
[199:45.45]Ooh, good one.
[199:46.87]Ah, that's what they all say until I beat them, just like magic.
[199:51.45]Embarrassed.
[199:52.73]It's time for your public embarrassment.
[199:55.02]I've heard that before.
[199:56.22]Now hush up and bowl.
[199:58.87]Alright, let's kick his ass.
[200:08.35]It's this thing.
[200:08.89]I'm gonna lose.
[200:10.87]Should I go smoke a bowl?
[200:11.89]God.
[200:22.85]It's so hard.
[200:23.67]I feel like the mouse is probably better.
[200:26.55]But I can't... By the way, if you're going to buy this game and you have more than one monitor, don't buy it unless you have a controller.
[200:33.74]You cannot play this game with your mouse if you have two monitors.
[200:40.64]Your mouse is still being captured by your desktop, no matter what you do.
[200:45.88]So when you... You'll move the mouse around in the game and you'll see it on your other monitors.
[200:50.42]If you click, it'll exit the window.
[200:58.36]There are fixes for that.
[200:59.20]How did that miss?
[201:06.34]Just turn the other monitors off.
[201:08.14]That's a pain in the ass.
[201:10.04]This game was on PS2.
[201:11.16]I'm going to play it the way it was meant to be played.
[201:16.40]Get in there.
[201:20.84]Alright, that's a full clear.
[201:24.06]Again.

[201:37.23]It's alright.
[201:37.65]It's alright.
[201:41.85]It's always... Those ones are so hard.
[201:44.99]I'm not going to be able to hit either one of these.
[201:51.36]Come on!
[201:58.20]Get in there!
[202:07.56]Did I win?
[202:07.90]Oh, I beat him.
[202:11.76]It was so easy.
[202:12.56]Oh, I got a rubber chicken.

[203:30.92]Alright, mechanic train.
[203:33.22]Do I not even have a mechanic?
[203:34.16]I don't have a mechanic.
[203:43.85]There's only one person.
[203:44.65]Alright, train.
[204:00.11]Build with reliability.
[204:01.32]Maintain the ride.
[204:04.32]The circuit pieces are not already placed in the order in which they have to be positioned.
[204:08.88]I don't have any staff?
[204:12.52]Oh my god, this is going to be horrible.
[204:18.49]Um, what?
[204:18.91]Okay.
[204:25.35]I just did it.

[206:08.59]Uh, wait.
[206:12.39]You're already a mechanic.
[206:15.77]Alright, trained.
[206:27.81]What are they wearing?
[206:29.13]They're wearing... What are those things they're wearing on their heads?
[206:33.99]What is that?
[206:42.08]I feel like that's kind of... They're wearing like plastic bags on their heads.
[206:45.68]Where's the oxygen?
[206:46.52]What are those things?
[206:50.28]There's like no oxygen in there.
[207:02.73]Let me complete this.
[207:08.95]Good, good, good, good, good.
[207:14.95]It's from the underwater section.

[208:01.49]Oh my goodness.
[208:12.30]Okay.
[208:24.03]This reminds me of every single live action Disney show's intro.
[208:33.68]And somebody always gets like a pie in the face.
[208:40.69]It's always like a pie that goes in somebody's face.
[208:46.58]Even if it's not in any episode.
[209:03.36]Hair tied up in braids!
[209:07.17]That was one of the worst things I've ever done.
[209:15.50]I don't care if I'm doing bad.
[209:16.66]It's fine.
[209:17.26]Don't worry.
[209:17.94]It's okay.
[209:41.73]Hold it.
[209:42.65]Hold it.
[209:43.39]Hold it.
[209:44.11]Hold it.
[209:44.67]Release.
[209:49.45]Alright, that's definitely going to be some good training.
[209:55.09]I actually have staff members now.
[209:56.39]That's fine.
[209:57.03]Alright, so now... We can get out of this.
[210:03.73]I got 10 grand.
[210:05.59]There it is.
[210:07.49]Danger.
[210:27.10]So how do we take care of the robots?

[210:39.97]I want to build another coaster.
[210:40.85]What do you guys think?
[210:50.67]I think I want to do giant.

[211:26.75]Is this an actual person or is that an animatronic?
[211:32.01]That would be a really scary animatron.
[211:35.77]It would be so horrifying and unsettling.
[211:37.45]I would hate that.
[211:38.11]Alright, let's get a coaster built here.
[211:40.97]Only 2,000 bucks?
[211:41.93]Give me a break.
[211:43.98]I can afford it.

[211:56.52]Oh, we have to make this crazy.
[211:58.02]Yep.
[211:59.60]I'm gonna make this all over the place.
[212:04.14]Let's take it this way first.
[212:05.34]Oh my god.
[212:35.01]I want it to go up.
[212:38.80]At what, um, miles per hour do the insides of a human liquidate?
[212:45.75]It's gotta be more than like five, six, seven hundred, right?
[212:56.12]Still too high.
[213:01.90]An airplane goes, it's a pressurized cabin, but that goes like four, three hundred miles per hour, 400 miles per hour.
[213:09.80]Oh, I'm out of bounds.
[213:10.68]Okay.
[213:11.10]Okay.
[213:34.99]Depends on acceleration.
[213:39.19]Now let's have him go through like 10 of those walls.
[213:41.61]Right here.
[213:56.06]Vertical overhang.
[213:57.14]Whoa.
[214:01.84]Oh, I need my... Okay, increase my loan.
[214:03.89]I'll take a loan.
[214:24.64]Where do I want this to end?
[214:26.56]This thing's crazy.
[214:35.11]Maybe this would be a little tighter.
[214:36.01]Do you think people are going to fly off this?
[214:58.30]Okay, that should be fine.
[215:02.28]Slicer Dicer?
[215:15.19]Too many pieces?
[215:16.01]What do you mean I have too many pieces?
[215:26.14]Oh, shit.
[215:29.25]Where's the end?
[215:30.09]Over here.
[215:33.80]I'm running out of money.
[215:38.77]What are you talking about?
[215:39.49]It's right there.
[215:58.81]Alright, let's take a look.
[216:00.99]Let's get on it.
[216:07.48]Wait, it's backwards?
[216:08.84]Why is it backwards?
[216:11.22]Oh, wait a minute.
[216:13.82]It's one of these.
[216:17.26]Oh.
[216:20.71]I thought, okay, so this thing can spin freely.
[216:23.23]This is gonna be awful.
[216:40.39]That's too much.
[216:45.21]First person?
[216:48.09]Alright, first person.
[217:02.96]Launch the carts into the guy's mouth.
[217:09.86]The fact that you're going like more than 150 miles per hour and the thing is turning... No wonder it's nausea 100.
[217:15.97]This is awful!
[217:36.14]What is max spin?
[217:42.67]Oh, see you later.
[217:48.99]Oh, the poor kids.
[217:49.67]Don't you have to be tall enough to ride this shit?
[217:54.43]They were not tall enough.
[217:59.60]Oh.
[218:07.74]I don't think I'm tall enough to ride that ride.
[218:20.13]Oh, they want a bathroom.
[218:21.99]I got it.
[218:23.05]I got you, Raider.
[218:25.12]Cheeseburger stall.
[218:26.06]Oh, I want a cheeseburger so bad.
[218:33.46]Build an arcade?
[218:42.01]Auto Sprint, Bumper Cars, Ghoul Gunner, Ghoul, RC Wars, Hauntings, Splatimal, Stunt Rider, Tank Frenzy, Trampolines.
[218:57.16]Do I do Auto Sprint?
[218:59.14]This costs $1.
[219:00.00]Oh, it's already built.
[219:02.72]Okay.
[219:02.94]I need money.
[219:09.40]Get your delicious hamburgers here.
[219:14.23]I think that just exploded.
[219:19.85]What's Lawnville?
[219:22.20]The ghoul game is fun?
[219:23.22]Alright, let me get a bathroom.
[219:28.76]Too many people complaining about no bathroom.
[219:33.30]That's very much high priority.
[219:34.50]Alright, now I need a game.
[219:39.25]We say that haunting is fun?
[219:45.37]Shoot zone.
[219:45.91]Haunting.
[219:46.25]I can sit back a little bit.
[219:50.47]It's alright.
[219:56.42]How does this work?
[219:59.10]Shoot zone.
[220:03.34]Use the correct weapon for the situation you're in.
[220:07.59]Jump, reload, duck, shoot.
[220:11.71]Is this an FPS?
[220:13.47]This is an FPS.
[220:15.53]Oh, this is fun.
[220:29.16]Got it.
[220:41.90]This kind of reminds me of one of those games you would download and have a virus baked into it.
[220:45.74]I mean, the game still existed, but it was a virus.
[220:56.57]Reload!
[220:59.35]At least shotgun.
[220:59.85]We're staying with shotgun.
[221:04.57]I gotta get skulls.
[221:09.73]Nice.
[221:09.91]Is there a sprint?
[221:11.92]That's Crouch.
[221:17.60]Where are they?
[221:17.92]There they are.
[221:18.66]Alright, get him.
[221:21.01]This one is pretty fun.
[221:21.81]I actually like this one.
[221:34.88]This would be awesome.
[221:41.41]This is the kind of game that somebody plays in the background of a movie.
[221:44.54]It is.
[221:44.76]Yeah, this is the game that's on the TV.
[221:52.56]In the TV show.
[221:53.42]That's good.
[221:57.23]I like to do well.
[222:04.77]It's all up here.
[222:08.81]It has to be, right?
[222:17.50]No skull?
[222:18.16]Get out of here.
[222:20.34]What are you talking about?
[222:27.01]Um, what?
[222:28.03]Alright, there's one there.
[222:39.62]One more.
[222:48.56]This gun kind of sucks.
[222:53.52]Die already.
[222:55.20]What is going on here?
[223:01.72]Where's the skull?
[223:02.38]There's only one more.
[223:07.62]This looks like VR.
[223:15.31]There it is.
[223:16.03]Go, go, go, go, go.
[223:26.27]Finally he's playing Destiny 2.
[223:27.87]Destiny 2 PvP?
[223:31.35]Yeah, man.
[223:38.10]I didn't even jump, he floated.
[223:39.38]That was dumb.
[223:52.24]What the f-
[223:59.23]I gotta go higher, right?
[224:00.61]Yeah, of course.
[224:12.00]Get me out.
[224:12.64]Oh my god.
[224:19.32]No, don't fall.
[224:21.32]We're fine.
[224:21.96]Alright, I did it.
[224:26.51]That's not it?
[224:30.09]Do I have to... I gotta kill all the ghouls.
[224:35.92]Yeah, that's what it is.
[224:36.64]Alright, I got two minutes to do this.
[224:38.02]I got it.
[224:38.30]I got it.
[224:38.54]I got it.
[224:38.72]I got it.
[224:38.96]I got it.
[224:39.18]This is the best gun.
[224:58.47]Running out of time.
[225:10.17]I'm going to get a huge double cheeseburger or something.
[225:20.32]Not yet.
[225:20.70]Not right now.
[225:21.18]Get wings instead.
[225:26.19]I don't know.
[225:39.48]Alright, one more spawn and that's it.
[225:48.06]Make sure you get olives.
[225:48.96]I guarantee, I promise that I will do the olives on my fingers thing.
[225:54.91]That's fun.
[226:00.27]I'll do that this weekend.
[226:02.95]Bandito Chinchilla, best minigame.
[226:04.79]I'll get it right now.
[226:10.08]I think that's in the other park, though.
[226:12.42]Alright, I'm going back.
[226:13.00]Let me check on the other park.
[226:14.26]Alright, people are starving and thirsty and need to go to the bathroom.
[226:24.54]I thought there were nine people in the whole park.
[226:37.44]I want to go to...
[226:40.73]What's Lawnville?
[226:49.75]What's wrong with this lady?
[226:50.47]What's wrong?
[226:52.63]What's this lady doing?
[226:54.19]What's wrong?
[226:54.47]Yeah, may I suggest the mouse ride?
[227:09.37]Oh, sorry.
[227:09.91]I'll handle it.
[227:10.79]I dig that.
[227:11.65]Here, I want you to have this.
[227:16.49]Oh, thank you.
[227:20.88]What happened to this kid?
[227:21.58]Do stunt rider?
[227:26.88]Whoa!
[227:28.28]We are little.
[227:29.80]We are little.
[227:31.00]I told you we were little.
[227:32.68]I told you we were small.
[227:35.10]I didn't think it was real.
[227:36.42]I didn't think we really were tiny one-inch tall people.
[227:41.16]I thought that was just a little thing in the beginning.
[227:42.80]Oh.
[227:49.97]I told you we were little.
[227:56.85]Garden?
[227:57.21]Alright.
[227:57.49]You want... You want little boring rides?
[227:59.85]I'll give you a little boring ride.
[228:02.63]Here.
[228:02.83]Um... Something... Where is it?
[228:08.84]Here you go.
[228:11.02]The little fucking teacup ride.
[228:12.52]There.
[228:27.27]Oh, this is not... This sucks.
[228:35.04]I don't want to ride this one.
[228:40.27]However long this ride is, it's two minutes too much longer than it should be.
[228:46.77]It's awful.
[228:51.40]I thought this was a gentle ride.
[228:53.02]I don't think I even have gentle rides.
[229:06.36]I was at nausea 30.
[229:08.28]I would puke immediately getting off that ride.
[229:14.34]Look, here you go.
[229:15.20]This thing here.
[229:21.13]No space for it?
[229:22.01]Oh well.
[229:26.31]I need to go back to the other park.
[229:32.21]Cassaville?
[229:39.04]We'll go this way.
[229:42.30]Press A to scream next time.
[229:44.02]Please, I keep telling you about it.
[229:45.40]Press A to scream?
[229:51.38]I don't like this.
[229:55.76]Wait, press A to scream.
[230:00.43]I don't want to play pool.
[230:09.55]Baby.
[230:15.16]Now, we gotta go back to the original place.
[230:16.62]Oh, there's Candyville.
[230:19.91]There's a lot of parks.
[230:35.17]This is the one that I have that's most developed, alright?
[230:39.95]Everyone wants gentle, gentle jaw.
[230:41.47]I want it to be gentle.
[230:42.35]You want gentle?
[230:45.19]Fine.
[230:46.03]Here.
[230:47.67]Here's a gentle ride.
[230:48.67]Here you go.
[230:51.71]There it is.
[230:54.33]Nice and gentle.
[231:22.39]Oh mom, that one was so fun, that was so crazy!
[231:53.24]Free money, still 2 love.
[232:00.32]I finally got some more.
[232:01.28]I got some gentle rides.
[232:04.60]Alright, what's that game that you guys all want me to play?
[232:10.30]What is it called?
[232:12.34]Game.
[232:16.73]Where is it?
[232:17.11]I don't see it.
[232:20.99]Is it Bandito?
[232:24.52]It was there before.
[232:25.12]Are people doing this because they have to go to the bathroom?
[232:33.82]Oh, she's dying of thirst.
[232:38.12]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, right here.
[232:55.67]Oh, right.
[232:56.13]I have not placed one of these yet.
[232:58.19]I'll do two.
[232:58.71]One here and one here.
[233:09.88]Where's the Bandito game?
[233:17.46]Different park?
[233:21.80]The first park.
[233:23.54]Can I fast travel?
[233:29.75]Is there a way I can just, like, fast travel to something?
[233:39.72]The train?
[233:40.18]Are we on the map?
[233:44.34]I don't... I think it's just this is the map of this park.
[233:48.68]Over from the train.
[233:49.30]Yeah, I couldn't use the train yet, though.
[233:50.64]Oh, it's because I didn't have another park unlocked.
[233:57.93]Alright, let me do that.
[234:03.32]Alright, we're going to go to Thrillville Stunts.
[234:09.39]A lot of people here.
[234:12.89]Watch it.
[234:16.44]People are really thirsty.
[234:19.36]I got it.
[234:19.64]I'm on it.
[234:29.35]Okay.
[234:30.63]I gotta find a good place to put the bandit game.
[234:33.11]Probably over here.
[234:38.13]Alright.
[234:38.58]Bandito Chinchilla.
[234:41.12]It's already built.
[234:42.08]Where?
[234:49.48]You can juggle enemies in the air.
[234:51.20]Alright.
[234:53.68]Jump.
[234:54.58]Weak attack.
[234:55.25]Pick up item.
[234:55.93]Use attack.
[234:56.47]And strong attack.
[235:01.21]Who's your fighter?
[235:04.09]Ndito Chinchilla?
[235:07.87]Ndito Lightning Fists?
[235:10.17]Ndito the Mosquito?
[235:13.38]Salma the Little Mama?
[235:15.80]Light as a Feather?
[235:17.46]Quick as something very quick.
[235:19.38]This one here.
[235:22.10]This is the best minigame?
[235:25.97]Alright.
[235:26.45]How does it work?
[235:36.88]Okay.
[235:37.58]Okay, that's a strong attack.
[235:42.08]Is this a beat-em-up?
[235:46.44]Okay, I get it.
[235:51.85]Let's go.
[235:56.03]Points.
[235:59.61]Combo.
[236:03.90]It's like Castle Crashers.
[236:06.62]What a great game that is, by the way.
[236:08.18]I wish they made a Castle Crashers 2.
[236:16.68]I know you can't really make that game any better than you, but still.
[236:23.11]I would love to have seen another one.
[236:24.67]You're hiding behind the cactus.
[236:28.79]Uh-oh, a lizard.
[236:35.24]Is this the boss?
[236:38.90]No, not really.
[236:39.48]A guitar?
[236:45.92]Oh, Jesus.
[236:59.47]El Tortoise.
[237:06.63]Alright.
[237:07.79]Kick his ass.
[237:13.62]L lizard plus fell off plus ratio.
[237:17.78]Oh.
[237:25.15]I want some more weapons.
[237:27.21]I have a power move, but I don't think I should not even use it.
[237:40.19]Oh, I, okay, I get it.
[237:41.67]I gotta juggle.
[237:46.23]Isn't this an amusement park game?
[237:55.48]This is one of the arcade games in the amusement park game.
[238:06.81]What does +2 mean?
[238:08.21]Oh, we're gonna explain that.
[238:10.67]A lot of new people on this stream.
[238:17.84]Uh, +2 and -2 are a way to gauge how much the chat room has, uh, has agreed or disagreed with how comedic or funny the last thing that I said was.
[238:29.75]Or, sometimes they abuse it, and they do -2 based on something that somebody in the game says.
[238:36.26]Like, I don't even say it, but apparently it's my fault for showing it.
[238:48.47]I don't understand.
[238:54.35]Where's face cam?
[238:55.13]Fuck you.
[238:58.27]You want a face cam?
[238:59.11]You want to turn the face cam on?
[239:00.44]You really want that?
[239:05.18]It's very soon.
[239:06.00]I'll turn it on.
[239:08.78]You're about to see me on camera.
[239:09.80]Alright.
[239:11.06]Hold on.
[239:11.38]This is important.
[239:16.79]Power move?
[239:22.55]Did I just do it?
[239:28.53]Ooh, that's a too big punch.
[239:29.73]Okay, cool.
[239:36.56]Oh.
[239:36.90]Alright, still got him.
[239:44.42]How about you?
[239:45.88]You know what's funny?
[239:46.56]You know, like Golden Axe?
[239:48.26]Have you guys ever played Golden Axe for real and not just for five seconds on like an emulator that you have or something?
[239:53.81]Have you ever played through that game?
[239:57.93]I don't think that game is actually possible to beat.
[240:00.79]I don't think it's possible.
[240:05.99]That probably would have been $50 to $100 in the machine.
[240:10.49]The final boss in that game is not possible to not die at least five to ten times at least.
[240:25.10]How come chat wants me to show my face?
[240:26.42]Because I've never done it before, and... They've been waiting for a face reveal, I've been trying, I've been hyping it up.
[240:32.94]Ever since I had, like, only a few hundred viewers, I've been hyping up a face reveal, and people were like, show it already, do it already, and I'm like... It's like, alright, eventually I will.
[240:45.54]And maybe I'll just do it.
[240:47.10]Maybe I'll just do it today.
[240:58.54]Please do it today.
[240:59.46]You know what?
[241:01.00]I'll do it today.
[241:02.44]I'm going to be really kind of nervous about it, though.
[241:12.59]I don't know.
[241:12.85]You never know what somebody's going to say about you, right?
[241:14.59]Like, oh, that's not how I thought you were going to look.
[241:16.59]That's not what I thought you looked like.
[241:27.63]And I get it, right?
[241:28.57]You have like an image of what you think I look like.
[241:30.27]2022 is the year?
[241:31.03]Yeah.
[241:31.45]What about your face emotes?
[241:35.59]What is this?
[241:57.00]um well I mean that's not my face though I mean I've uploaded and I've shown I've uploaded like really heavily photoshopped doctored images of my face all those that you're seeing are really heavily edited exaggerated features and el toad
[242:33.31]I always imagined you being over six feet tall.
[242:35.33]That's what I mean.
[242:35.79]This game's fun.
[242:41.34]Ciao!
[242:41.72]Make the L-Toad noise.
[242:44.40]I'll try.
[243:04.69]What do they do?
[243:15.41]I can't.
[243:16.52]I can't do that one.
[243:17.92]That one's way too much.
[243:25.42]This is just all like inside of the toilet bowl sound.
[243:29.50]I can't do these.
[243:30.14]And another.
[243:46.68]Ace reveal.
[243:48.00]Stop!
[243:48.64]Stop it!
[243:49.88]No!
[243:51.36]Okay.
[243:52.82]Okay.
[244:16.15]Did you see me?
[244:16.77]Did you see me?
[244:30.68]Wow, dude, you look completely different.
[244:32.08]You're not what I thought you looked like at all.
[244:33.50]Wow, dude, really?
[244:39.26]That's what I mean.
[244:41.42]This is why I didn't want to fucking do it.
[244:45.18]Because now, like, now everybody knows and whatever.
[244:48.64]It's just fucking annoying.
[244:51.66]I'm like, I'm like, I'm like really... No one's ever seen that before.
[245:01.18]I like the lizards.
[245:11.21]Take that!
[245:11.75]Take that!
[245:19.83]That was the worst joke.
[245:22.75]It's not even my joke.
[245:24.09]You can't count that as my joke.
[245:25.59]This is your joke.
[245:30.12]I'm just enabling you.
[245:31.62]That's the difference.
[245:33.54]This is not my joke.
[245:34.78]I'm enabling your joke.
[245:43.59]What the?
[245:48.47]When does Elden Ring come out?
[245:59.42]That's such a... You just said tomorrow, and I don't know why I thought that was funny.
[246:14.37]February what?
[246:16.35]I'm going to play the hell out of that when that comes out.
[246:20.58]You better believe it.
[246:28.34]Comes out in 45 minutes.
[246:37.41]How much further in the game do I have to go?
[246:38.81]This is like an entire game.
[246:46.26]Okay, I can't hit this.
[246:57.78]Elden Ring is going to be awesome.
[246:58.80]It got delayed again?
[246:59.62]No, it didn't.
[247:01.24]Did it actually?
[247:03.22]I don't remember hearing that.
[247:12.87]February 24th.
[247:13.37]Yeah.
[247:13.71]Yeah, come on.
[247:18.66]Is it a Stunt Rider minigame after this?
[247:21.62]I don't know about it.
[247:27.59]Stake.
[247:27.79]I can go fast.
[247:36.77]Do Bloodborne stream?
[247:41.89]I would if it was 60 FPS.
[247:58.13]I don't think the game can even be 60 FPS, right?
[248:04.28]I would do a Bloodborne playthrough for you guys.
[248:06.90]And those of you that don't know, that's one of my favorite games ever made.
[248:10.50]I've beaten that game probably 10 times.
[248:14.92]At least.
[248:16.49]It's one of my favorite single player games ever.
[248:18.31]It probably is my favorite single player game ever made.
[248:20.31]But I cannot play it again.
[248:23.15]I don't want to.
[248:24.15]If it does a 60 FPS update...
[248:27.92]Then I will have, that's a reason for me to do it again.
[248:41.86]Ow.
[248:43.12]Pick it up.
[248:48.31]Eat frozen fruits.
[248:52.95]Oh, in like a smoothie?
[248:54.41]I don't just eat them out of the bag or something.
[248:57.63]I put them in a smoothie.
[249:03.86]Remember, this game doesn't end.
[249:05.84]It has to.
[249:06.30]Frozen food is... Frozen food is delicious.
[249:22.28]How?
[249:22.80]Why are you eating frozen?
[249:23.94]Why are you eating frozen food?
[249:26.00]Frozen if you just eat it, you can bite into it.
[249:39.99]Alright, let's do it.
[249:46.26]Ice cream.
[249:46.86]That's not the same thing.
[249:51.22]Ice cream is not even frozen solid.
[249:56.58]It's at the certain temp... It's still... You can still mush it around.
[250:00.32]It's not frozen.
[250:04.03]It's very, very cold.
[250:11.59]But it's not... It's not a frozen solid piece.
[250:14.25]It's not frozen.
[250:22.69]They can hurt each other.
[250:27.27]Okay, this is getting actually pretty tricky.
[250:28.51]I gotta move.
[250:30.61]Popsicle.
[250:31.99]Popsicle is frozen.
[250:37.65]At what temperature does ice cream freeze solid?
[250:40.21]Somebody look it up.
[250:44.62]At what temperature is ice cream... does milk freeze like that?
[250:52.92]Zero Celsius.
[251:01.50]It's the cream.
[251:02.16]Yeah, yeah.
[251:05.38]Oh, shit.
[251:05.60]Is it a boomerang?
[251:07.00]No.
[251:08.84]It is a solid.
[251:10.92]No.
[251:11.50]It is a non-Newtonian fluid.
[251:14.66]It is a non-Newtonian fluid.
[251:17.54]It's not solid, nor is it liquid.
[251:37.59]I like frozen pizza.
[251:38.65]Yeah, but you're not eating it frozen.
[251:46.92]Frozen is solid defrosted equals liquid.
[251:49.34]Is ice cream frozen?
[252:08.25]Ice cream is a sweetened, non-Newtonian liquid, typically eaten as a snack or dessert.
[252:13.74]It may be made from milk or cream and is flavored with sweetener, either sugar or an alternative, and a spice such as cocoa or vanilla, or with fruit such as strawberries or peaches.
[252:28.82]Okay.
[252:38.64]We're just playing semantics, though.
[252:40.46]It's just a game of semantics.
[252:42.58]It's a liquid.
[252:56.76]You know what I think is weird?
[252:57.86]And look, I know people are gonna call me, like, two-head Andy, okay?
[253:02.86]But just think about the world, right?
[253:04.24]Think about how interesting this is.
[253:06.52]So, ice is frozen water.
[253:09.26]Ice.
[253:10.80]It's water that's been frozen.
[253:12.34]It is at a certain temperature to be solid, frozen water.
[253:16.08]When you put ice cubes into water, the water does not become frozen.
[253:22.09]Even if there's 100,000 ice cubes in the water.
[253:25.07]That's so weird.
[253:26.31]It's interesting to me.
[253:33.99]If you have a bunch of ice cubes in water, the ice does not freeze.
[253:37.76]It's just cold water.
[253:38.76]That's so weird.
[253:51.03]It's thermodynamics.
[253:51.89]That's what I'm saying.
[253:52.55]Thermodynamics is weird.
[253:53.75]You know what else is weird?
[253:57.53]An oscilloscope.
[254:04.10]We have this tube that can make lights to blow up, to make a tube on your television to have an image on your screen.
[254:10.18]What?
[254:14.36]You know, you guys don't know this.
[254:15.90]People think that, oh my god, imagine if we lived in a world with magic.
[254:20.57]Oh man, imagine if we lived in the Harry Potter universe and there was magic.
[254:24.83]We have magic.
[254:28.57]Our ability to do electronics is just fucking magic.
[254:32.61]Fire is magic.
[254:35.39]Can you think about it?
[254:37.95]The fact that we have steel, we can create steel, that's literally magic.
[254:42.61]That's magic.
[254:44.92]If an alien were to come down here, imagine if they didn't even know what like a metal processing was.
[254:50.66]Or what fire was.
[254:51.79]We would just, we would have magical fire powers.
[254:57.61]The fact that I have, the fact.
[255:00.91]I'm going full cam for this one.
[255:02.89]The fact.
[255:04.29]I'm at like 10 FPS, doesn't matter.
[255:06.37]The fact that we can relive our memories.
[255:12.71]Right now.
[255:14.31]right this very moment you see me right now on the screen I am sitting here I'm sitting in this in this spot you can relive this exact moment right now you can re you can see memories how crazy is that that alone should be that's magic that's literally magic
[255:36.38]We can take photos of stuff and just like... There it is.
[255:40.00]You have a physical memory that you can see.
[255:44.30]It's crazy.
[255:50.03]Your urinal is rotating.
[255:51.31]That has to make it extra interesting when I go.
[255:54.01]It's a game for me.
[255:57.19]I'm serious.
[255:59.09]Think about that.
[256:01.17]Imagine if aliens didn't have video or photo evidence of anything.
[256:07.10]they would be so freaked out.
[256:09.90]You tell an alien, you stand right there, alien, I'd like you to sing the alien national anthem.
[256:15.18]And they're like, and then you show them, you videotape them, and you show them doing that, they're going to go, and their head's going to fucking explode.
[256:28.41]You're literally showing them a memory that they had.
[256:32.31]You have burnt that into a physical medium.
[256:41.34]How many CBD gummies did you have?
[256:44.82]Zero.
[256:48.50]The fact that we can actually capture memories is crazy.
[256:54.76]You can open this video in three months and relive this exact second of your life and my life too.
[257:03.69]We think the aliens, the aliens, what if the aliens don't know shit?
[257:07.01]Okay.
[257:07.73]What if the aliens don't know shit?
[257:10.71]We think the aliens are going to come land and they're going to be like, here's our alien technology.
[257:14.33]It's this like ultra hyper electric beam and it's time travel.
[257:17.40]What if they don't know anything?
[257:19.12]And we're the ones that have all this crazy technology.
[257:24.30]They're going to want to take shit from us.
[257:28.03]They're going to want to take all of our technology.
[257:29.97]We are the aliens.
[257:35.39]He's speaking in chapstick.
[257:45.93]I'm just saying, it's crazy that we have all this like magical stuff in the world.
[257:52.90]Electricity is just magical light beams like palpatine.
[257:57.58]The fact that your refrigerator could just be powered.
[258:01.40]What if aliens don't have anything?
[258:03.42]Aliens could just be like, oh, wow, you have this thing over here that keeps your food from spoiling?
[258:10.92]Well, on our planet, uh, fructose, uh, we have...
[258:16.75]Um... We got stuff.
[258:18.47]What's that over there?
[258:20.21]Wait.
[258:20.77]Oh, it's a calendar.
[258:22.25]What's that?
[258:22.63]You keep track of days?
[258:24.99]And you have this... A device in your hand tells you when your next appointment is?
[258:30.95]God, I would love to know when my next appointment with Fruklon was.
[258:35.61]They don't know shit.
[258:37.19]Aliens don't know anything.
[258:39.31]We are... Alright, I'm freaking out.
[258:42.21]I'm losing my mind.
[258:42.91]But yeah, you get what I'm saying.
[258:44.34]I'm going a little too hard here.
[258:47.93]But you know what I mean?
[258:48.93]It's crazy.
[258:51.13]We have bees on this planet.
[258:53.43]There are bees.
[258:56.21]Think about what a bee does.
[258:57.53]Think about what a bee does.
[258:58.57]All of you.
[258:59.84]Think about what a bee does.
[259:03.62]Oh, no, that's not like we could fucked up an alien.
[259:06.84]Oh, no, this is little thing that pollinates plants.
[259:11.54]It goes and collects dust that comes out of this weird thing that grows out of the ground, by the way.
[259:17.86]This thing grows out of the ground.
[259:20.86]Plants are weird.
[259:22.53]And then it travels and puts that dust on other stuff and pollinates things.
[259:28.49]Just a simple act of pollination to an alien, it would be probably absurd to them.
[259:37.92]Who knows, guys?
[259:38.76]The fact that you can have sounds come out of your mouth might be the most absurd thing that they've ever heard.
[259:45.58]Imagine an alien that's just sitting there watching.
[259:49.32]Be like, what is that coming out of his mouth?
[259:55.66]Shoot it.
[259:56.36]They would level us.
[259:57.12]They would level us when they heard the sounds.
[260:02.77]You don't know what they have and neither do we.
[260:08.15]What's this tangent?
[260:08.83]This tangent is the world.
[260:09.73]We have a magical fucking world and people don't think we do.
[260:19.72]Stay right there.
[260:32.81]What?
[260:35.63]What is this?
[260:38.51]What is this?
[260:39.61]Why does this exist?
[260:40.91]This is magic powers.
[260:44.03]Joe, explain this to me.
[260:45.85]Why does this exist?
[260:54.39]Okay.
[260:57.91]Every planet has that.
[260:58.81]You don't know anything about planets.
[261:00.01]All we know is we can see, like, Mars has a bunch of red gas all over it.
[261:03.63]You don't, we don't know anything.
[261:10.67]What are magnets?
[261:14.51]It's a big red planet.
[261:15.47]It's just, my hands are, like, all dusty.
[261:17.31]Hold on.
[261:18.80]This is a big red planet with red gas all over it.
[261:21.97]There's no people on Mars.
[261:23.92]There's no aliens on Mars.
[261:25.60]You know how many planets exist?
[261:27.12]It's probably crazy that we exist in the first place.
[261:31.78]When an alien lands on this planet and they go, Roger that.
[261:35.40]Yeah, this is not another planet, but just like red gas everywhere and a bunch of like red, red, everything's red.
[261:40.98]Oh, see, there's life there.
[261:43.26]Hi, Mr. Alien.
[261:44.36]How are you?
[261:47.80]And their heads are going to explode.
[261:48.99]Exactly what I told you was going to happen.
[261:53.22]I'm telling you, that's what's going to happen.
[261:58.85]But that means they would have to be able to talk too.
[262:03.73]No, but maybe they'd have like telepathy.
[262:07.51]What are you doing?
[262:10.34]Someone stop him.
[262:13.34]This dude's been huffing paint.
[262:19.84]You see this?
[262:22.42]Why can I do this?
[262:23.78]Do you see this non-Newtonian fluid?
[262:25.70]Do you see what this is capable of?
[262:28.76]They would get off the ship and I'd go, oh, hold on, Mr. Alien.
[262:34.64]What's that device he's putting in his mouth?
[262:38.37]Eat it.
[262:48.15]We're gonna go.
[262:48.65]We're gonna go.
[262:49.20]We're gonna go.
[262:50.58]We're gonna go.
[262:51.22]Eat it.
[262:52.34]Eat it.
[262:53.50]Well, they would think it was food.
[262:55.10]Well, do they even know what food is?
[262:59.32]Huffing chapstick.
[263:00.26]Don't you get it?
[263:00.94]Like, what if they don't even know what food is?
[263:04.40]The fact that they could just be this weird sentient thing of light that doesn't even know.
[263:09.47]Imagine if you, the fact that you eat a cheeseburger in front of an alien and then seven to twelve hours later you go into a room and that food comes out of your body.
[263:21.75]What a bizarre fucking planet we're on.
[263:26.29]Just the act of shitting could be so world-changing and world-ending.
[263:32.64]Pregnancy.
[263:33.98]The fact that a person lives inside of somebody else's stomach.
[263:37.96]It's like no way, man.
[263:44.56]They would show up and they would leave.
[263:46.74]We would scare the living hell out of everybody that came to this planet.
[263:57.03]El Tortoise.
[264:06.08]You would.
[264:07.60]Well, I'm not the ambassador of Earth.
[264:09.84]How do we even decide who that is?
[264:13.62]I'm serious.
[264:14.24]Like, it would have been Macho Man Randy Savage.
[264:17.50]The world is so fucked up.
[264:18.67]We have such a crazy world with all these magical powers.
[264:21.21]Like, that would be the person they would probably expect.
[264:38.06]Just fire, man.
[264:39.02]Fire is just magical powers.
[264:48.79]We have furries.
[264:51.65]I don't, but that's not a... So what do you mean by that?
[265:04.28]Wait, you saying that the ambassador of the planet should be like somebody in like a fursuit?
[265:18.53]I'm into that.
[265:19.67]I'm actually into that.
[265:21.51]That would be fun.
[265:27.87]Mushrooms are weird.
[265:30.39]Classical music is weird.
[265:31.47]You have music!
[265:36.78]We have no idea.
[265:37.54]We could be the ones that have all this art and entertainment and electricity and power.
[265:44.57]The sight of running water could turn an alien inside out.
[265:58.16]And by the way, we've made up all these chemicals' names.
[266:01.81]A war would not start with the aliens over, oh, power!
[266:05.29]It's about power!
[266:07.61]No, we call water, water, and that's not what it is.
[266:10.73]It's something else completely different, and we've been completely wrong about it.
[266:13.30]And they're like, ah, it's actually not water.
[266:17.02]It's something else entirely.
[266:18.10]You have the wrong chemical makeup.
[266:19.60]It's not, what's a chemical?
[266:21.18]Chemical?
[266:21.98]Chemical?
[266:22.72]What's that?
[266:24.54]No, this is a, it's, we could be wrong about that.
[266:27.28]And what if they tell us?
[266:29.22]Then somebody just fucking drops a nuke on Planet Fructose.
[266:38.78]I think this is the boss.
[266:49.57]This dude is beyond zonked.
[266:53.96]Oh we have a crazy world.
[267:04.47]And we make up all this stuff that we already do that the aliens are apparently going to do better than us, right?
[267:15.56]And we have virtual reality.
[267:17.18]So, I mean, the aliens probably have like a real holographic virtual reality world.
[267:22.14]We're projecting what we think we're going to be able to do in the future.
[267:24.90]And that's just going to be us.
[267:32.10]We're going to scare the living shit out of anybody that comes over here.
[267:48.65]Given Alien Dark Souls, you would have to explain to the alien the concept of controlling something that isn't alive with your hands and your mind.
[267:59.99]Huh?
[268:04.89]Well, you see here, Mr. Alien, the thing on the screen right now is not alive.
[268:08.44]I'm controlling it with my brain and using my brain to put inputs into a device which controls the non-living being on the camera on the screen right now.
[268:17.35]Don't worry.
[268:18.05]When you see it get its head exploded by the sledgehammer, it's not real.
[268:23.19]It's just I'm making that happen because I feel like it.
[268:25.28]Huh, isn't that fun?
[268:26.02]Hey, so where's your teleportation device?
[268:29.44]That's what we're really looking for, Mr. Alien.
[268:31.22]Hey, you guys can teleport, right?
[268:32.80]Are you going to teach us?
[268:36.94]Take that!
[268:52.55]This is so offensive to an alien viewer.
[268:59.63]Explain horror movies to an alien.
[269:01.55]I know, it's fucking crazy.
[269:08.30]So what's happening right now?
[269:10.00]We're watching somebody get killed.
[269:11.90]He just put a knife on that person.
[269:14.26]The knife is a weapon in your people's culture that hurts.
[269:18.20]Yes, it is.
[269:19.61]That man just put that thing that hurts people on their neck and slashed their neck and their life fluid came out.
[269:27.11]No, no, no, alien.
[269:28.67]Stupid alien.
[269:29.45]What are you, dumb?
[269:31.01]We just pretend to kill each other.
[269:33.05]Gruesomely, horrifically, and scarily.
[269:36.25]It's for fun.
[269:36.87]War and death is not fun.
[269:40.93]Huh?
[269:41.69]Why are you doing this, human?
[269:43.77]Oh, wait, you see.
[269:45.27]We all get together, and you're going to love it.
[269:47.81]We all get together, and we sit in a big room with hundreds of us.
[269:53.13]We go into a big room, and we get a bunch of snacks, and we watch that exact person slash the throats of tons of innocent, scared people.
[270:02.40]We all clap, and it's a really great time.
[270:04.64]None of it's real, though.
[270:05.72]And by the way, it's being projected into your brain through your eyeballs, and it's a fake thing on screen.
[270:13.43]Let's beat the game.
[270:17.03]Explaining a horror movie.
[270:19.80]Why do they do this?
[270:21.20]What's wrong with them?
[270:24.44]We must do a re-origination of the flower.
[270:26.76]That's right.
[270:27.34]Sorry.
[270:27.68]You have no technology.
[270:29.50]We're projecting that image of an alien that's going to wipe us out.
[270:34.20]We're the scary ones.
[270:36.80]We must do a re-origination of the plant.
[270:38.52]That's going to be us.
[270:42.10]We're not going to be happy with a season of some alien TV show.
[270:45.80]We're just going to get rid of it.
[270:59.99]Okay.
[271:02.47]Magic being a new viewer?
[271:03.57]Are you done?
[271:13.02]Uh, yeah, I think so.
[271:19.55]Hi, I'm so hungry I could eat a rock.
[271:22.39]There's no food here.
[271:24.33]This guy's an alien.
[271:28.79]Oh, sorry.
[271:36.03]No, I'm not going off again.
[271:37.81]I don't need to explain what a dinosaur is to an alien again.
[271:40.27]No, because we don't even know what a dinosaur looks like.
[271:43.19]We pretend to know what a dinosaur looks like.
[271:45.41]We just have bones.
[271:49.22]Like Steven Spielberg had a T-Rex go, and we all go, yeah, yeah, that's right.
[271:55.21]That's exactly what happens.
[271:56.31]Alright, I'm done.
[271:58.29]I'm done.
[271:58.77]Get me out of this.
[272:00.37]Get me out of this.
[272:03.69]We're moving on.
[272:05.07]I'm going to continue my playthrough of whatever this, Thrills, Thrills Seeker.
[272:16.18]People are hungry.
[272:16.74]Let's do ice cream and pizza.
[272:19.00]It's a good combo.
[272:20.14]Pretty relaxed.
[272:34.20]Some ice cream.
[272:36.14]Everybody loves ice cream.
[272:43.42]How did Frozen Fruit get to that?
[272:44.86]I'm so sorry, everyone.
[272:50.59]You're trying to explain language so much, but not writing.
[272:53.19]Guys, we're going to meet aliens one day, and it's going to be such a disappointment.
[273:03.45]It's going to be a puddle on the ground with a face.
[273:07.25]That just goes like...
[273:13.84]And that's going to be the extent of our alien contact.
[273:18.24]This is going to be so disappointing.
[273:25.68]Oh, where's the time travel?
[273:26.77]Where's the holograms?
[273:27.77]No, this is a puddle that has a face.
[273:29.33]It like burps every four to five minutes.
[273:32.67]Uh, I want to build something else.
[273:48.35]Oh wait, I want to play this.
[273:54.53]The alien's probably just going to be a vat of bacteria.
[273:57.43]Yeah.
[274:01.77]It's going to be small bugs.
[274:03.91]Alright, I told you to get me off this, not get me on it again.
[274:22.88]I'm doing it with a controller, by the way.
[274:36.41]Ooh!
[274:36.59]Alright, that's cool.
[274:43.80]What's this do?
[274:45.06]Dual welding?
[275:01.72]Ow!
[275:07.64]What is this?
[275:09.76]Um... What's going on?
[275:11.66]It's a vacuum?
[275:14.37]Okay.
[275:14.73]Do it again.
[275:32.11]What points do I need?
[275:44.58]By the way, if I'm wrong about all the alien stuff, they're taking me hostage first.
[275:49.48]You know what I mean?
[276:06.23]Yeah, I'm gonna be the first, like, execution from the aliens.
[276:28.06]Explain porn to an alien.
[276:36.05]That's like... That's so hard.
[276:47.55]Oh, you see, Mr. Alien?
[276:49.23]We've got these two people.
[276:51.35]And they have intercourse with each other on this device that you've been shown before.
[276:58.33]And it's a means to excite the Watcher.
[277:02.78]Oh, okay.
[277:03.82]That makes perfect sense to me, I guess.
[277:06.20]Oh, good.
[277:08.69]But that's not all.
[277:10.11]You see, uh, also, there's a ton of other things that people find to be in that same realm of, uh, procreatable intimacy.
[277:22.09]Um, it's not just that.
[277:23.59]There's a whole lot of stuff.
[277:25.70]What could you possibly mean?
[277:27.68]Procreation is procreation.
[277:30.52]Um...
[277:32.76]You're not entirely... No, I'm sorry, Mr. Alien.
[277:37.00]See, some people... Alright, I'm done.
[277:45.47]I'm done, I'm done, I'm done.
[277:49.35]I don't understand, human.
[277:50.33]What's the point of 30 people being in this room?
[277:53.79]Well, I mean...
[278:12.10]I feel like we would be held at arm's length ultimately.
[278:18.87]I think we would probably be diplomatically... We would get like texted every now and then just to see how we're doing.
[278:28.91]I don't have to come over.
[278:29.85]I just want to know how things are.
[278:31.81]Things are going well?
[278:33.67]Good.
[278:35.11]Please leave us alone.
[278:40.89]Oh, God.
[278:41.33]I don't want to do this.
[278:47.56]Cat, this man is almost 40, by the way.
[278:52.24]I mean, not almost.
[278:55.34]Close, but not really.
[278:56.34]He's playing toothpaste to aliens.
[279:09.63]I want to ride this thing.
[279:11.45]You see how cool this thing is?
[279:14.42]I'm not 40.
[279:23.97]I want to ride this.
[279:27.39]What was that?
[279:30.37]Anti-Thrillville ad.
[279:32.42]Oh, shit.
[279:37.30]Try the go-karts.
[279:38.70]I want to ride this monster truck thing.
[279:40.74]It looks crazy.
[279:41.34]I thought that was a nose.
[279:46.94]It's the pizza slice.
[279:47.86]I was like, what is the giant nose stall?
[279:49.64]What is that?
[279:53.30]How do I ride this?
[279:56.28]I want to ride that.
[280:07.26]Alright, we'll put this one here.
[280:09.43]Big enough space for it, right?
[280:10.35]Yeah.
[280:10.51]It's because it's not a ride.
[280:18.27]There sure is a lot of people dying on it.
[280:20.49]How is that not a ride?
[280:30.23]I have to leave.
[280:30.79]This stream is too much.
[280:33.59]Alright, well, just know that... Oh, wait, this is Sammy from the original first five minutes of the game.
[280:39.32]How are you?
[280:41.94]It was weird.
[280:43.60]Like, small, like, eight-year-olds don't shake hands.
[280:48.05]It was weird.
[280:48.61]They don't shake hands?
[280:52.15]He still hasn't gone to the bathroom.
[281:01.50]I am the best.
[281:02.60]Funny you should ask me that.
[281:03.86]I was looking for a champ.
[281:07.46]Alright, you gotta go to the bathroom.
[281:08.54]We're gonna do a running competition.
[281:09.98]I actually don't want to play this.
[281:29.58]It's gonna make me sick.
[281:35.39]What's your worst moment?
[281:38.81]You sure it's not being able to go to the bathroom?
[281:42.82]What's the best steak?
[281:43.60]Do little kids eat steak?
[281:45.72]I don't remember eating steaks when I was like seven or eight.
[281:52.04]Steak?
[282:04.32]I don't... I didn't eat steak.
[282:09.16]It's love steak?
[282:09.60]I don't remember eating a steak.
[282:10.60]I didn't eat steak until I was like, yeah, at least like probably 14, 15, or 16.
[282:14.09]Maybe not, no, probably like 13 or 14.
[282:16.57]Not this young.
[282:30.62]Cut it up.
[282:31.08]That's the best game, you're right.
[282:35.87]Alright, get out of here.
[282:41.97]Why is this sad?
[282:42.69]I got 16 grand, we're gonna make an insane rollercoaster.
[283:05.03]Is there another slot for a roller coaster?
[283:12.55]I don't think there's an... Oh, yeah, there is.
[283:13.77]Okay.
[283:16.99]Let's make a coaster here.
[283:17.99]Alright, this one's going to be nuts.
[283:26.26]Wagon trail.
[283:27.76]Pendulizer.
[283:28.70]Log... Alright, how about the pendulizer?
[283:41.31]What have I got for Woe?
[283:47.49]Nothing so far.
[284:07.53]what's the maximum way to to like liquefy somebody's insides right it's like to do this and then this immediately right oh that's yeah that's pretty cool angelizer
[284:55.65]Come on, let me do it.
[285:03.52]Liquefy their spines.
[285:08.92]Man, you're just pressing buttons.
[285:10.90]I'm so bad at this kind of stuff.
[285:12.64]I know that there's a ton of you guys watching.
[285:14.24]That you likely... ...spend a lot of time meticulously making a track and everything.
[285:20.39]I just... Not enough power.
[285:26.26]I need more power?
[285:27.92]Uh oh.
[285:29.35]Alright, let's try it.
[285:36.65]Wait, what?
[285:41.23]How can you not get a full solution from that?
[285:45.53]What are you talking about?
[286:04.48]Why?
[286:04.84]I can't go this far.
[286:10.54]I don't have enough power.
[286:15.00]Just put more electricity.
[286:27.51]I guess I can't build a roller coaster.
[286:28.93]Unless I end it here.
[286:38.61]This coaster sucks.
[287:16.65]Just building another park.
[287:18.35]I had a lot of money here.
[287:26.50]Ugh.
[287:31.00]Alright.
[287:34.70]You're really excited to ride this one.
[287:38.26]Come on in.
[287:38.64]Tell me how you like it.
[287:53.66]Where is she?
[287:57.75]Um, hello?
[288:05.09]Looks fun!
[288:13.23]Alright, I'm gonna go over to the other park.
[288:16.87]I gotta catch up on missions here.
[288:18.77]There will always be things to do to keep the place in business.
[288:22.48]I know what I'm doing.
[288:24.98]Okay, games, no guest.
[288:30.20]Watch out, three critics just entered Thrillville.
[288:32.08]As park manager, you can talk with people and win them over.
[288:34.49]Let's see what the notoriously grumpy H.G.
[288:38.59]Krupp has to say.
[288:39.43]Hello, I'm the park manager.
[288:43.95]Hello, I'm H.G.
[288:45.03]Krupp, theme park critic for Teen Monthly Magazine.
[288:47.78]Okay.
[288:52.04]I have better things to do than listen to you yammer on.
[288:54.84]I can't believe how rude you are.
[288:57.85]And nobody gives a shit about your opinion about my park.
[289:00.55]See how many people are here?
[289:01.37]Do you see how many customers are here right now?
[289:04.37]Go look on Yelp.
[289:05.87]I got a 3.4 right now.
[289:08.15]I got a 3.4 on Yelp.
[289:09.70]What you're gonna say is meaningless.
[289:13.36]It's a fair price.
[289:16.06]Fair price.
[289:17.24]Lots of attractions.
[289:19.30]Nobody cares what you have to say.
[289:23.80]That's Sammy!
[289:38.13]Alright, but, but, alright, alright.
[289:39.61]Jokes aside, golden ticket.
[289:42.45]You have a VIP pass from your inventory to a critic Mopar.
[289:45.15]He already had, didn't already give him one?
[289:48.59]I already gave him something, didn't I?
[289:49.67]Saw a review?
[289:50.55]No, not the movie.
[289:50.97]What?
[289:51.45]I bribed this guy an hour ago.
[290:15.92]And he said he was gonna scratch my back if I scratched his.
[290:26.02]You dick.
[290:36.86]What?
[290:41.25]I can't believe I'm giving him another one.
[290:45.44]Hey, that's great.
[290:46.80]Thanks.
[290:49.71]I have to say your bribes are better than those I got from Globojoy.
[290:52.89]Okay.
[290:53.53]A golden admission ticket and all the free racing games I can play is infinitely better than an autographed picture of Globojoy's president, Vernon Garrison.
[291:01.41]Okay.
[291:01.76]Globojoy's tax shelter world didn't even have a race ticket?
[291:04.92]What kind of lame theme park is that?
[291:07.12]That's good.
[291:08.64]That's fine.
[291:09.28]With the presents coming?
[291:10.34]I need to make dune buggies.
[291:11.30]Let's go.
[291:11.70]Dune buggies.
[291:12.46]Where is it?
[291:42.96]I don't have it yet.
[291:45.83]Where's that test of strength?
[291:46.73]I want to do it.
[291:53.09]It's a coaster.
[291:53.89]Oh, I don't have racetracks unlocked.
[291:59.06]Okay.
[291:59.32]Power up and action.
[292:06.14]Power your swing up.
[292:12.10]Um, like, what's happening?
[292:26.23]Oh, you have to do, I thought it was all in one go.
[292:28.05]Alright, power up.
[292:31.38]Okay, then select the angle, and then right in the middle.
[292:38.94]I won.
[292:45.36]I can do... I can get it to 12.
[292:51.75]Damn it.
[292:57.87]One more time.
[293:04.04]I just want to get it right in the middle.
[293:14.16]Whatever.
[293:14.42]One more time.
[293:25.47]I'll get it.
[293:30.18]Bingo.
[293:33.44]Fuck!
[293:34.20]That was- Relax.
[293:36.24]Seriously, relax.
[293:37.90]That's not that big of a deal.
[293:38.78]I just did the thing with that guy with the guitar.
[293:41.14]Like, do-do-do-do-do.
[293:43.13]Like, relax.
[293:45.79]That was so uncalled for.
[293:47.01]I already won.
[294:00.70]Who cares?
[294:01.02]I got a bear.
[294:03.68]Cool.
[294:08.86]I'm into the drinks.
[294:14.19]That's fine.
[294:17.17]There's only been four customers?
[294:20.87]Is it too expensive?
[294:36.22]Okay.
[294:43.23]What did I want to do?
[294:44.55]Oh, I want to unlock racing.
[294:48.28]Where's research?
[294:49.10]Park upgrades, research.
[294:52.48]Okay, compact coaster.
[294:55.62]When do I unlock the thing to beat the movie critic?
[294:57.76]$1,000 a month?
[295:00.86]Alright, we're going to do a marketing campaign in the national newspaper.
[295:16.19]I got 11 friends out of 26.
[295:17.25]We're going to have to cut some of these.
[295:19.13]Molly Noodles.
[295:20.05]Get unfriended.
[295:20.71]Can I unfriend you?
[295:21.41]Lopots.
[295:21.74]I don't want to be friends with any of these people.
[295:45.33]Last activity, restroom.
[295:46.77]So why is the bladder so high?
[295:54.63]I just built a bathroom.
[296:00.01]Wait, he's going to this bathroom.
[296:03.00]There he is!
[296:05.00]Sammy!
[296:06.82]How are ya?
[296:08.12]Good to see you again, Sam.
[296:11.34]You like the new bathroom?
[296:12.66]How are the facilities?
[296:17.54]Oh, he's probably so happy right now.
[296:21.46]Here, have a beer.
[296:22.76]Or a beer.
[296:26.38]What?
[296:27.99]Give it back.
[296:28.39]Give me that back.
[296:29.93]Can I have that back?
[296:31.45]No, I don't want to do this.
[296:51.17]I have to beat this kid's ass in something, right?
[296:52.99]Like, I gotta destroy you in something.
[296:55.87]Wagon Trail?
[296:57.77]What's one that I can just absolutely wipe the floor with this kid?
[297:04.59]Which one?
[297:06.53]I mean, Bandito, possible.
[297:09.56]Prospector Putt?
[297:11.62]Wagon Trail?
[297:14.26]Why are there all these weird floating VR games?
[297:16.62]I don't want to do that.
[297:21.44]They're all just like these odd VR games.
[297:24.89]Oh, shit.
[297:25.33]I just went the wrong way.
[297:29.65]Do putt-putt?
[297:31.21]But I can't just do... I'm gonna beat everybody in putt-putt.
[297:34.93]Oh, he's got a raid, too.
[297:37.70]It's Kony.
[297:39.86]Welcome, everybody, from Kony.
[297:41.38]Thanks, Kony, for the raid.
[297:45.92]Playing Thrillville.
[297:47.79]Outrageous.
[297:51.06]Hope you had a good stream.
[297:51.90]Welcome, everybody.
[297:52.98]What's going on?
[297:53.52]How are you?
[297:54.50]Nice of the raid.
[297:56.90]He's gone to the bathroom, so we're fine.
[297:58.08]No, you know what?
[298:08.65]Welcome, everybody.
[298:09.53]It's time.
[298:10.29]Let's just beat it.
[298:13.36]Let's just beat him in the putt game.
[298:17.82]Oh!
[298:19.02]I don't actually want to... I want to play on my broken course where I can cheat.
[298:22.57]I don't want to do this.
[298:26.83]Actually have to play nine holes against this kid?
[298:30.85]I want to play him against the one where I can beat him in one hit.
[298:39.26]Alright, this is really actually pretty important.
[298:43.38]He's pretty good.
[298:45.69]He got that hole in one, so did I. Alright, par three.
[298:48.77]Let's go.
[298:49.11]Right there, I think.
[298:58.76]I can make round up here.
[299:02.43]Just don't screw this up.
[299:08.09]How much softer was I supposed to do that?
[299:17.35]Alright, he got four here.
[299:18.65]I'm gonna use that old strategy.
[299:29.68]You might as well just leave now, kid.
[299:32.06]Good luck.
[299:32.76]It's over.
[299:36.80]Why'd I get two for that one?
[299:41.96]Gotta hit this one a little bit harder.
[299:43.16]Because it does have to go uphill.
[299:48.40]It's a back-to-back homing wall.
[299:51.73]Can I make it three in a row?
[299:52.45]Let's make it a hat trick.
[299:57.29]He went over.
[299:58.63]Oh, you went under.
[299:59.47]That's fine.
[299:59.85]Let me get a good look.
[300:03.71]Gotta hug this wall.
[300:11.18]Oh, yuck.
[300:15.56]Nobody knows how to do these.
[300:16.72]It doesn't matter.
[300:26.24]I made up a lot of ground.
[300:27.02]Good.
[300:30.15]Alright.
[300:34.23]He could still come back.
[300:34.95]This is par four.
[300:42.74]I wonder if I just avoid.
[300:45.00]Yeah.
[300:45.56]I'm thinking just avoid the middle.
[300:48.00]Or just hit it hard enough.
[300:48.91]I'm going to try to hit it hard enough.
[300:50.69]Let's see.
[300:55.98]Perfect.
[301:03.40]Perfect.
[301:07.12]Alright.
[301:08.65]He got, he went under on this one.
[301:13.13]It's a little weird.
[301:24.20]Up there.
[301:26.36]Not bad.
[301:35.51]Sink it.
[301:39.44]Very hard for me to lose this now.
[301:43.20]I'm thinking full power right here.
[301:45.68]Or at least like 80% power.
[301:56.82]Let's get silly with this one.
[302:20.92]Alright.
[302:21.30]Okay.
[302:21.62]Alright.
[302:21.88]Don't screw this up.
[302:44.79]I won.
[302:45.05]That was pretty good.
[302:49.09]I kind of blew it at the end there, but I think that was fine.
[302:51.52]It was.
[302:51.98]We're literally best friends, so now what can I... What's the point of this?
[302:57.28]What can I do?
[302:57.76]Huh?
[302:58.40]No, it doesn't.
[303:12.73]Lightning strikes the Earth 17 million times a day?
[303:15.99]That's a lie.
[303:23.78]200 times a second lightning is striking the Earth?
[303:32.38]How?
[303:37.25]Alright, good conversation.
[303:38.81]Goodbye.
[303:39.19]Earth is big.
[303:39.67]Yeah, but 200 times a second, though.
[303:41.39]That's a lot.
[304:14.12]Alright, I got 20 grand.
[304:14.78]Let me go to the other section over here.
[304:16.74]Let's go to Saddleville.
[304:22.81]Oh, that's right, the ocean.
[304:23.97]I don't know why I keep thinking, like, New York City getting hit by lightning 200 times a second.
[304:31.27]Or, like, L.A.
[304:32.46]Oh, yeah, this is just 200.
[304:33.70]It's literally these oceans.
[304:35.04]Okay.
[304:39.95]I forgot about the ocean.
[304:41.11]200 times a second.
[304:41.87]You get the bad ending?
[304:42.97]Okay.
[304:43.11]Okay.
[305:10.17]The ocean sucks anyways.
[305:13.73]Why do you say that?
[305:16.89]That's kind of a weird opinion.
[305:18.85]The ocean sucks.
[305:19.83]Like, fuck the ocean.
[305:21.11]That's a weird opinion.
[305:22.57]Why do you hate the ocean?
[305:26.66]The ocean's actually kind of unbelievable.
[305:34.54]Imagine explaining an ocean to an alien.
[305:40.91]Oh, I played that already.
[305:41.71]Is there even room for more rides here?
[305:51.93]I don't think there is.
[305:52.59]Alright.
[306:08.36]Have I... Battleville?
[306:12.76]I don't have a Battleville.
[306:23.45]Whoa.
[306:23.89]What's that ride?
[306:41.50]Who is this?
[306:47.91]I don't have money.
[306:57.40]There are just tanks running over stuff.
[307:03.26]Alright.
[307:04.43]I'm going to build something over here.
[307:09.11]Coffee.
[307:16.46]Coffee and... Bathroom.
[307:28.81]Blueprint.
[307:30.11]Alright, can I do a race car now?
[307:42.99]Racetrack.
[307:44.39]Build your own.
[307:47.03]Ooh, dune buggies.
[307:47.73]I can go against the Critic.
[308:03.56]Okay.
[308:05.36]I don't want this to be too boring, but I don't want it to be too...
[308:16.55]Whoa, there's planes that fly over there.
[308:46.17]Like my pretend enthusiasm.
[309:05.78]What?
[309:06.41]Is it okay to sell the following rides that are in the way?
[309:08.63]What ride?
[309:10.11]Oops, well I sold that ride that was in the way.
[309:19.20]Alright, I just want to beat that guy.
[309:38.44]What?
[309:45.16]Just finish the track.
[310:20.88]Did I though?
[310:21.42]Hold on.
[310:22.26]Can I go down?
[311:01.17]Oh boy, that's a big one.
[311:04.69]Alright, I gotta practice first.
[311:10.68]Brake is X, accelerate is A, power slide is right trigger.
[311:14.06]Okay, let's do it.
[311:17.31]He's practicing too.
[311:19.81]I was just trying to kill everybody.
[311:25.91]Alright, let's go.
[311:31.12]No!
[312:07.27]No?
[312:07.51]How many laps?
[312:10.27]Three?
[312:14.46]Thank god there are bumpers.
[312:15.62]Yeah, I would have fell off five minutes ago.
[312:22.02]The track mini-map on the left looks like you got shit-faced and tried to make a pretzel.
[312:29.22]That's a great drunk idea.
[312:30.65]Let's make pretzels tonight.
[312:50.35]Or... The... You know, like, when they have the skeleton in the classroom and it has the organs?
[312:58.10]It's just the intestines.
[313:01.06]That weird, like, kind of cut-in-half person.
[313:02.70]Alright, now I gotta challenge that guy.
[313:25.39]Alright, leave him in the dust.
[313:26.23]Five stars, hell yeah.
[313:30.03]Alright.
[313:31.61]Where is he?
[313:32.01]Hey, Mo Potts.
[313:37.25]Hey, you piece of shit.
[313:43.02]You're about to lose to a child.
[313:53.75]I hear you're not half as good as do you think you are whatever I'm definitely better than you oh really are you adequately prepared to lose I'm gonna beat you like a drum okay it's time I'm gonna get a prediction going will I beat this guy I think I will
[314:21.53]Yo, the map track looks like Squidward.
[314:23.81]I have to see it.
[314:27.36]I don't know.
[314:31.46]Does it?
[314:43.96]Mo Biden?
[314:50.95]What's good for acid reflux?
[314:54.51]Don't eat before bed.
[314:56.23]If you're going to eat, make sure you have at least an hour or two to digest before you lie down.
[315:04.64]Don't eat anything too crazy.
[315:06.02]It's usually a lot before bed.
[315:13.24]Avoid stuff that really kind of makes it... I was told one time...
[315:18.77]And I made like a little joke to the doctor and he like didn't think it was funny.
[315:22.60]He just kind of moved on.
[315:23.48]I probably was like the 30th person that day that made the joke.
[315:27.59]When I was first talking about, oh, man, I've got acid.
[315:30.35]What should I do to stop the acid, right?
[315:31.97]I got put on an anti-acid protein pump inhibitor right before.
[315:39.91]And he gave me a list of all the things that you should avoid completely if you're trying to reduce acid and see how it goes.
[315:47.72]It was coffee, alcohol, spicy food, chocolate.
[315:52.52]It was a list of just all this stuff.
[315:54.60]And I looked at him and I was like, oh man, all the good stuff, huh?
[315:58.12]I can't eat all the good stuff.
[316:00.32]And he did, with a straight face, he just walked out of the room.
[316:02.71]He didn't even listen.
[316:04.69]It was like he did not even care that I spoke.
[316:09.79]Yeah, it was like garlic, onions, coffee, alcohol, cheese, literally everything that you like on Earth.
[316:18.34]He walked out of the room.
[316:19.88]It was as if I didn't say it.
[316:23.63]He probably hears that every day.
[316:24.81]Here we go!
[316:33.40]Hey, you old fuck.
[316:42.15]Now neither one of us can win.
[316:43.27]You're trapped here forever.
[316:44.33]You're my prisoner.
[317:01.27]What if he goes beyond the finish line?
[317:29.23]Die, motherfucker!
[317:35.37]It's not Squidward.
[317:36.47]What are you talking about?
[317:37.33]Doesn't look like anything at all like Squidward.
[317:46.10]This guy's bad too, by the way.
[317:47.80]The guy that I was racing in the generic race was better than the guy that's the best racer in the game.
[318:00.59]Let's see if I can lap him.
[318:01.37]I'm gonna toad this motherfucker.
[318:02.43]Remember in the beginning of the stream?
[318:04.51]I talked about lapping toad?
[318:25.88]Oh shit.
[318:46.31]I'm gonna try to turn him the other way.
[318:47.99]I want to spin him backwards.
[319:00.26]Oh, I can't accelerate up the hill!
[319:03.60]Where is he?
[319:04.82]Wait, where'd he go?
[319:08.74]Where is he?
[319:10.13]Oh, shit.
[319:10.61]He's... Oh, he's screwed.
[319:31.63]I'm trying to get him stuck so I can lap him.
[320:03.43]I've won.
[320:04.21]Oh, I beat him.
[320:06.03]Oh, okay, okay.
[320:08.29]Alright.
[320:09.69]No, no.
[320:10.00]Get out of here.
[320:10.56]Scram.
[320:15.08]I don't get at least a 3.5 on Yelp.
[320:21.82]I'm taking the VIP back and I want my bear back and I want that rubber chicken I gave you too.
[320:24.97]There's a lot of people in the park though.
[320:36.20]I'm getting hungry.
[320:37.75]I want to eat.
[320:39.55]Time's up.
[320:39.81]It's been five and a half hours.
[320:41.03]Why do I feel like it's been like three?
[320:52.79]Now the real question is, what are we going to play this weekend?
[320:58.22]It's completely up in the air.
[321:00.32]Because after this weekend stream, whether it's probably Saturday or Sunday, or Saturday,
[321:07.09]After this weekend stream, maybe Sunday, maybe Saturday.
[321:12.55]I'm doing about like a week or two of VR straight.
[321:17.35]I'm setting that room up again.
[321:18.19]We're going to go for it again.
[321:23.84]Wait, I want to see how this one works.
[321:29.48]No, I hate these.
[321:30.38]I don't understand why people ride these.
[321:35.27]Don't even explain this to aliens.
[321:36.77]Explain this to me why people get on this.
[321:38.41]Because I don't get it.
[321:39.95]This makes you feel awful.
[321:46.23]What's wrong?
[321:58.54]What needs repair?
[321:59.28]I don't know.
[322:08.14]Ten million versus one.
[322:10.66]Wow.
[322:17.22]Yeah, I don't get it.
[322:18.08]I'm not into it at all.
[322:20.50]It makes you feel awful.
[322:23.68]Even if it doesn't make you feel, like, sick or anything, it makes you feel bad.
[322:26.87]My head hurts.
[322:39.10]Do a coaster.
[322:39.62]Alright.
[322:41.60]What about some of the pre-built ones?
[322:43.02]I'm very curious about these.
[322:43.98]The old wagon.
[322:47.53]What are some of the pre-builds?
[322:51.95]I'll build my own.
[323:00.76]Alright, let's go.
[323:01.34]Oh, I just got this compact coaster.
[323:03.36]Minimum power?
[323:03.98]What?
[323:04.16]Area power limit?
[323:05.30]Oh, I can't.
[323:30.21]Should I play Inscription?
[323:31.97]People keep saying to play that.
[323:35.60]But, I don't know.
[323:36.82]Play more Everhood?
[323:45.36]That's not a bad idea either.
[323:51.69]You're too dumb for Inscription?
[323:53.11]That's what I'm afraid of, I'll be honest.
[323:58.36]You got to do Monster Rancher?
[323:59.34]That's right.
[324:00.74]We'll figure it out.
[324:03.30]What's that?
[324:03.66]Alright, I'm going to play one more game and then I'm going to get some food.
[324:10.01]We'll end it in like another 20 minutes or so.
[324:13.55]Turbo Turboville.
[324:23.81]She's putting in double time there.
[324:27.31]NBA 2K.
[324:31.19]Alright.
[324:33.71]Do you guys think if I played NBA 2K20... This is not going to happen.
[324:39.65]I've got to get this out there.
[324:41.96]Would more than 5,000 people be at that stream?
[324:49.42]Would that stream get more than 3,000 or 4,000 viewers?
[324:53.32]If I played NBA 2K22.
[324:59.48]What's wrong?
[325:01.92]This thing's broken?
[325:02.82]Sell it.
[325:04.76]Why'd I sell the guy?
[325:05.60]Oh, this thing too.
[325:17.13]This thing was always at the fair.
[325:28.57]Ugh.
[325:34.20]I can't even look at it anymore.
[325:35.10]I don't even want to look at it.
[325:35.76]Yeah, I don't think that more than 5,000 people are on that stream.
[325:45.26]Alright, what's the last thing I'm going to do?
[325:53.16]I need one more thing to do.
[325:55.22]Viewer's choice.
[325:56.20]What should I do?
[326:00.81]One more game.
[326:03.17]Pretty sure there are 15,000 people who don't give a shit about this game.
[326:07.39]Yeah, but there's a difference between a game... Playing NBA 2K and just playing NBA, I think there's a difference.
[326:21.95]None of you guys would want to watch me play Madden either.
[326:34.78]Alright.
[326:35.78]One guy in the chat wanted me to play Stunt Rider really bad again.
[326:38.50]So I'll do it for the guy in the chat.
[326:48.25]Play Dota?
[326:49.95]I don't know what's worse.
[326:52.82]Playing Dota...
[326:55.80]for five hours on stream or playing like Madden NFL 2K19.
[327:03.34]I'm not sure what you guys would like less.
[327:14.38]2K would be way worse.
[327:17.25]I don't know.
[327:19.27]I feel like I could... It might be fun just to even play Madden and, like, lose by 100 points.
[327:25.34]But playing, like, poorly in Dota or League would just be kind of embarrassing and there's no fun, funny, any... It's just like, wow, this guy just sucks at League.
[327:36.29]Like, if I run the ball back for a touchdown, that's excitement.
[327:39.63]If I run into the tower, I'm an asshole and nobody likes me.
[327:50.34]I was doing alright right there.
[328:00.67]MOBAs are really boring to watch.
[328:04.65]The only MOBA I've ever really played was Smite.
[328:07.50]And I even understand that people don't really want to watch that.
[328:12.18]Unless... Unless that you're good enough.
[328:16.96]Because those games are really competitive.
[328:18.88]And if I was unbelievable at Dota or something, right?
[328:22.86]If I was, like, super rank or whatever it is.
[328:26.72]I mean, yeah.
[328:27.18]If you're not super diamond rank and I'm diamond rank, then it's like, okay.
[328:34.66]But if I have no idea what I'm doing, I don't even know what the character's names are, I feel like people would just be like,
[328:41.28]Jeremy, what are you doing?
[328:48.40]I don't know what items I'm buying.
[328:50.43]Okay, that could be fun for a little while, but not for more than a couple of streams.
[328:55.91]I don't know.
[328:56.29]I don't think.
[329:03.22]Play Tekken 7?
[329:06.88]Oh, you mean this?
[329:11.19]Because that's all that would be.
[329:14.37]This is a real song.
[329:19.25]Here we go, here we go, here we go now, now.
[329:21.83]Here we go.
[329:22.19]Right?
[329:46.98]Go, Bailey.
[329:47.74]Go, go, go.
[329:48.58]You hit next track?
[329:56.33]Oh, I'd love to.
[329:57.07]I don't care about DMCA.
[329:57.88]Turn this up.
[330:24.11]Wait what what what was that?
[330:41.01]I want to hear that I'm actually kind of interested What was that I'm so confused
[330:53.72]Is that like a remix or like a reimagining or something?
[330:56.74]What else do I got?
[331:01.73]Do they have like three songs?
[331:16.82]What is this?
[331:18.56]And why is this in this game?
[331:20.24]This is a very interesting soundtrack.
[331:26.94]Is this one?
[331:48.26]P-H-R-I?
[331:56.89]B-I-L-L-E?
[331:59.29]What are they spelling?
[331:59.97]Oh, yes, alright, this one's safe.
[332:05.77]No, I want that song.
[332:12.97]He's got a broomstick horse called Dynamite, his very favorite friend.
[332:20.03]An old steed about four hands high that runs just like the wind.
[332:25.46]Is this from Red Dead?
[332:26.92]I don't know.
[332:28.92]That he can't apprehend, the Wookiee Tio, the littlest cowboy rides again.
[332:37.96]When the other kids are lost in space.
[332:41.66]Space.
[332:42.08]Plastic rocket ships.
[332:44.06]Chips.
[332:45.00]Well, he's meeting bad guys face to face with a big iron on his hip.
[332:49.92]Chips.
[332:51.42]There's a word he's heard, but it don't mean a thing to him.
[332:56.46]Oh, whoopie-die-oh.
[333:01.36]Wait, something goes.
[333:05.25]That's it?
[333:06.19]It goes like...
[333:11.99]Where is it?
[333:14.59]No.
[333:17.87]It does, doesn't it?
[333:42.44]Oh shit, oh no!
[334:03.09]Oh, is this one's- He was a bull- nope.
[334:08.22]They have like ten songs in the whole soundtrack.
[334:12.65]Alright, I'm out of here.
[334:17.13]I'll see you guys later.
[334:19.57]I'll see you on Wednesday.
[334:23.53]See you Sunday probably.
[334:24.99]I kind of want to hear this.
[334:28.65]I kind of like this.
[334:29.67]Alright, turn it down.
[334:36.03]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[334:37.45]I'm, I'm, I'm kind of at my end of this game.
[334:40.92]It's really cool.
[334:41.80]Hope your nostalgia brain was, uh, you got to scratch it for a little bit.
[334:49.34]I'm gonna get some food.
[334:50.62]I'll see you guys on Saturday.
[334:52.76]Saturday, probably still gonna be 4 o'clock.
[334:55.56]My sleep schedule's awful right now.
[334:59.76]So, Saturday at 4 p.m.
[335:01.28]Pacific.
[335:02.84]It's going to be a mystery game, and we'll probably pick it in pre-stream.
[335:06.22]So if you want to have a say in what is going to happen on Saturday afternoon, we will do a poll in pre-stream.
[335:13.12]I'll come up with a few things.
[335:15.06]And then after Saturday, we're going to do probably two weeks of VR.
[335:20.46]At least a few times.
[335:22.12]And then after that, it's going to be a big stream.
[335:26.23]And then after that,
[335:28.87]We'll see in the Neldon Ring, right?
[335:31.01]I'm ready.
[335:31.51]It's going to be an exciting few weeks.
[335:38.86]Well, a lot of community subs, a lot of subs in general, too.
[335:42.14]I didn't catch them all, but thanks.
[335:45.80]Here's everybody that was subscribed tonight.
[335:53.22]Thanks.
[335:53.50]I had a great time.
[335:57.04]Sometimes it's fun just to have like a little game in the background while we just chill.
[336:00.56]It's a lot of fun.
[336:03.01]I'll be back on Saturday.
[336:07.01]Do you pee in bottles?
[336:08.19]No.
[336:08.91]I pee into a toilet.
[336:15.28]We'll figure out what we're going to do.
[336:21.72]Explain aliens again.
[336:22.80]Yeah, that was, I don't know.
[336:24.64]The goblin just kind of took over there.
[336:28.83]I don't know.
[336:29.39]I don't remember that whole conversation.
[336:30.97]All I know, it was about 30 straight minutes.
[336:32.65]I don't remember anything about it.
[336:45.97]It was the chapstick, Peter.
[336:48.08]It was the chapstick, Peter.
[336:54.79]Don't forget the olive fingers.
[336:56.35]I will not forget the olive fingers.
[336:58.49]I promise.
[337:05.63]I will do on that stream on Saturday the stupid thing that that person wants me to do.
[337:10.60]And I don't know why they want me to do it.
[337:18.14]I'll see you Saturday.
[337:18.82]Have a great night.
[337:19.72]See you this weekend.
[337:21.14]Thanks for sticking around.
[337:21.80]Thanks for hanging out.
