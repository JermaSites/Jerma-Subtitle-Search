[ve:60.16.100]

[00:39.86]Why don't we start a little early today?
[00:41.64]Come on, why not?
[00:42.64]Come on, why don't we start a little early today?
[00:48.31]What is it, 6.40?
[00:49.77]Look at my watch.
[00:52.97]Hi guys.
[00:56.34]Welcome to the stream, welcome to tonight.
[00:58.04]Ah.
[01:05.47]Late to work.
[01:06.05]No, not today.
[01:07.03]Alright.
[01:12.71]Look at how loud this is.
[01:14.33]Can you hear this?
[01:16.95]That's my earbud.
[01:20.03]When your fucking earbuds even give off this loud of a noise, you know you're in for a real fun time.
[01:29.26]We're at EU time.
[01:30.50]EU friendly time.
[01:32.38]It's like 20 minutes early.
[01:36.60]So, I don't know how long the stream is going to be.
[01:41.76]I could lie to you and say this is going to be like a five hour stream.
[01:44.78]This might be like a two hour stream.
[01:46.54]I don't know.
[01:47.75]It depends on how fucking dumb this game is.
[01:50.69]We're playing Time Shift today.
[01:53.69]And, no, we ain't playing Time Shift on the PC as much as I would love to.
[01:59.49]We're playing Time Shift on the Xbox.
[02:02.29]Because apparently...
[02:05.03]If you have more than four cores, I have a six core CPU.
[02:10.41]You can't play this game if you have more than four cores.
[02:12.69]It doesn't work.
[02:13.29]It won't let you do it.
[02:15.35]So I gotta play on the Xbox.
[02:18.75]So more of that fucking console aiming.
[02:20.97]Can't wait.
[02:21.39]Gonna be fun.
[02:23.70]Typo.
[02:24.18]Where's our typo?
[02:29.66]Is there a typo in my tweet?
[02:36.62]I don't think so.
[02:39.34]Game's pretty good.
[02:40.34]From what I remember, I remember playing this game a long time ago, like 10 years ago.
[02:43.34]But I have too many cores.
[02:46.04]My computer's too good to play Time Shift on the PC.
[02:50.22]So we gotta resort to using our Xbox again.
[02:54.45]Anyway.
[02:55.57]Here it is.
[02:57.41]Time Shift.
[02:59.73]It's a game where you, like, literally can manipulate space and time.
[03:03.59]It's a first-person shooter.
[03:13.95]And it looks edgy.
[03:14.91]Well, it's going to be pretty edgy.
[03:16.29]This is really loud for me, though.
[03:19.09]This might be too loud for me.
[03:22.20]Anyways.
[03:25.22]This is all I got for tonight.
[03:27.69]Tonight is the- hold your next- You know, I'm gonna like put like a- I'm gonna go- I'm gonna put like a code in.
[03:34.62]Anybody know anybody that knows how to use code?
[03:36.78]I'm gonna make it so like next is an impossible emote to use.
[03:40.94]Unless the guy- I've been streaming for like at least like 45 minutes.
[03:46.46]Hold your next for a little bit, okay?
[03:49.58]Like where's my fucking code?
[03:50.82]Where are my code friends?
[03:57.75]But you can re... Or you could just delete the emote.
[04:04.51]Don't worry.
[04:04.79]We're going to talk about next.
[04:06.54]We're deleting next.
[04:08.80]Next emote is more like it.
[04:10.44]It's getting replaced with a fucking clown nose.
[04:17.65]We're going to replace next with previous.
[04:30.46]Alright, let's do it.
[04:35.90]You can't delete normal text.
[04:40.28]Yes, I did open the game to make sure it ran.
[04:42.14]Don't worry, I didn't play anything.
[04:43.48]New game.
[04:47.13]New game plus.
[04:48.87]Starting a new game will override your latest autosave.
[04:50.83]Are you sure?
[04:52.81]Yes.
[04:53.05]Alright, we're going to have to pick here.
[04:55.53]Casual, skilled, or elite.
[04:59.76]Well, I mean, I can't, like... This is normal, right?
[05:03.94]I can't pick this because Twitch chat will fucking scream at me.
[05:07.74]And I'll be made fun of.
[05:08.60]I'm not picking Elite because that's way too much.
[05:16.06]Can I change this?
[05:17.16]I don't know if this game is, like, fucking broken, stupid hard.
[05:20.25]I have no idea.
[05:21.51]I'm playing... I'm playing on a controller.
[05:25.61]I don't think this is a good idea.
[05:29.08]Casual, elite, elite, skilled.
[05:34.92]No skilled.
[05:36.01]Well, let's do what we are.
[05:38.07]We're not going to deny what we are.
[05:43.23]I'm not going to deny what I am.
[05:47.55]Thank you, Buster Boy, for the ten bucks.
[05:49.43]And they just say, Kreegasm.
[05:52.69]Fine, we'll do skilled.
[05:54.11]Fine.
[05:55.27]We're not going to be a casual gamer.
[05:58.44]Skilled.
[05:59.26]What a mistake.
[06:00.14]I can already tell you that was a dumb idea.
[06:02.64]Because this game is going to be like fucking hard.
[06:05.14]It's twin stick aiming.
[06:07.26]We already know how I feel about that.
[06:09.75]I'm going to go with skilled.
[06:14.79]I'm a highly respected physician with a hidden past who's been brought to advance a confidential time travel research project.
[06:20.45]Here we go.
[06:20.87]The entire building has collapsed and it was on top of a huge underground facility.
[06:25.47]This might be the cause of our city-wide power outage.
[06:29.86]Just rewind and fix it.
[06:31.06]Ow!
[06:31.36]Wait, what?
[06:31.90]Play it on PC?
[06:32.50]I can't.
[06:32.74]My computer's too good to play it on PC.
[06:57.28]So for those of you that are just trickling right... Look, see?
[06:59.25]Somebody rewound!
[07:00.65]Everything's fine.
[07:01.17]Alright, so for people that are just trickling in now, I need to explain this.
[07:08.11]If you have more than four cores, you CANNOT physically load Time Shift.
[07:14.39]I have six cores.
[07:15.32]Can't play the game.
[07:17.92]I have to go into my BIOS and disable two of my cores to play Time Shift.
[07:23.00]I ain't gonna fucking ruin my computer to play Time Shift!
[07:27.48]That's not gonna happen.
[07:32.87]Time shift back to core core.
[07:43.93]Disable cores.
[07:44.93]I ain't gonna like disable cores to play this game.
[07:50.59]Really?
[07:51.01]Like no.
[07:51.51]I ain't gonna like make my computer slower.
[07:57.70]Suit's not ready.
[07:59.64]But you took it anyways.
[08:00.63]Oh, Jesus Christ.
[08:04.29]Is he mad at me?
[08:05.41]Okay, that was fucking... I like this game already.
[08:20.92]Come on.
[08:21.36]He's like, come on, man.
[08:24.81]Come on, man.
[08:27.89]Suit wasn't ready.
[08:29.87]I got like coordinates.
[08:36.04]There's a guy from Half-Life 2.
[08:37.10]What's his name?
[08:39.60]Doctor... Doctor Jones?
[08:42.06]Doctor Jones, right?
[08:44.61]Whoa.
[08:44.91]A lot of signs on stable initiating neural stimulation.
[08:55.90]Dr. Breen, that's what it was.
[08:57.60]I thought it was Dr. Indiana Jones.
[08:59.87]Wait, then these people look... Well, we really are like jumping around time.
[09:07.83]Alright, let's go.
[09:08.55]Do I have time travel yet?
[09:09.36]Where do we go?
[09:23.06]Saving Condor, please don't turn off your console.
[09:25.46]You know, I just got into the game.
[09:26.90]Turn off the console!
[09:29.20]There's only one way where that would be, uh, like, acceptable.
[09:32.44]Is if, like, you were, like, fucking 14, and you ripped the cord out of the back of your Xbox because you hear your mom coming in at, like, 2 o'clock in the morning.
[09:39.99]You're supposed to be in bed.
[09:42.99]Ah, he's a dick.
[09:43.77]Okay, let's go.
[09:52.32]That was even closer.
[09:53.30]Okay.
[09:56.66]Nice FOV.
[09:58.02]Come on, this is like old, old game.
[10:00.48]For the Xbox 265.
[10:04.58]Oh look, it's a spy!
[10:05.58]Where'd we go?
[10:06.04]Gotta go back to the others, what?
[10:21.68]Is that the guy that I just talked to?
[10:22.76]Oh, no.
[10:23.00]Okay.
[10:23.18]When did this game come out?
[10:25.70]Uh, 2007.
[10:26.42]Alright, well, I guess I gotta go this way.
[10:30.05]I was just gonna do it again, just to fucking annoy everybody, but I decided not to.
[10:49.90]I did my first annoy everybody thing.
[10:54.24]Where are we going?
[10:54.70]Over here?
[10:55.96]Up?
[10:59.84]This is literally Half-Life 2.
[11:01.96]Dr. Breen is just yelling at us.
[11:07.36]Wait, but this came out in the same year as Half-Life 2, right?
[11:11.84]No.
[11:12.22]When did Half-Life 2 come out? 2001.
[11:14.98]2006?
[11:15.18]2005?
[11:15.62]So what are we supposed to be doing?
[11:19.18]What do we do?
[11:20.84]You're the one with the... I'm standing right next to you.
[11:23.30]You're the one with the gun.
[11:32.16]Go.
[11:34.44]Oh, okay.
[11:35.36]Let's go with Cookie's order.
[11:36.83]Now this thing's gonna break through.
[11:42.11]And it's gonna grab this guy and eat him.
[11:47.25]How come I don't have a gun?
[11:50.59]Where's my weapon?
[11:52.23]How do I get down?
[11:54.07]What's the get down button?
[11:58.74]Guys!
[12:00.38]Can I have one of your guns?
[12:02.30]Can I have this guy's gun?
[12:05.34]I guess not.
[12:06.40]Alright, let's go.
[12:11.72]What's the sprint button?
[12:13.18]That was a pretty good one.
[12:14.40]I can't do that.
[12:18.75]That guy didn't make it out.
[12:21.27]That guy definitely did not make it out alive.
[12:23.39]Where's my rewind button?
[12:24.97]Can I save that guy?
[12:32.80]I'm gonna go in here.
[12:33.54]This is the Half-Life 2 chamber.
[12:36.60]That's the Half-Life chamber.
[12:38.02]Press A to jump.
[12:41.53]It really did kind of get a lot of influence.
[12:42.95]Hey, but Half-Life, they don't... They do not have time travel in Half-Life.
[12:50.85]Sorry, guys.
[12:53.32]Left stick to crouch.
[12:56.90]Okay.
[12:58.76]Who's coming?
[12:59.60]Okay.
[13:00.50]Okay.
[13:10.03]Really?
[13:12.08]It's just Dr. Brain, but instead of Dr. Brain, it's the scientist.
[13:16.56]This guy's dead.
[13:22.48]The time shift really is just like Metal Gear Solid 4, Half-Life 2, Half-Life 1.
[13:31.34]So wait, those are my soldiers.
[13:37.64]Alright, let's go.
[13:38.64]I need a weapon now.
[13:40.42]How do we get up the fire escape?
[13:42.59]Oh.
[13:42.65]There we go.
[13:43.33]We're almost out of the tutorial.
[13:46.15]Thanks a lot, buddy.
[14:03.75]Okay, well, no friendly fire in this game.
[14:12.41]We've learned that you cannot shoot anybody on your own team in this game.
[14:17.60]What's ADS?
[14:18.24]There it is, right stick.
[14:24.42]Alright.
[14:29.61]Well, I am like a time traveler, right?
[14:31.57]I guess that would make sense.
[14:38.63]Just blow the door?
[14:45.61]What was behind the door?
[14:48.30]What's behind the door?
[14:51.14]That thing.
[14:52.56]Got him.
[14:57.56]I like this game.
[14:58.44]What is this thing?
[14:58.96]Is this a time gun?
[15:01.76]Can I shoot these bullets and they go back in time and hit the guys that were there before?
[15:12.24]Nice.
[15:15.90]Oh, this guy's dead.
[15:16.78]Yep.
[15:18.55]Holy Jesus Christ.
[15:21.99]Oh my god, that guy got shot.
[15:23.97]That guy got shot in the chest.
[15:25.99]And he like fucking missed a potato head and all of his limbs off.
[15:34.89]I like that gun.
[15:36.97]I wish it... Please tell me how to sprint.
[15:38.67]I need to know.
[15:47.91]Uh, oh, where is he?
[15:56.29]Fucking skilled.
[16:04.26]Oh god, I can already tell I'm not gonna, I'm gonna have a fucking problem with this aiming.
[16:09.34]I can tell you shouldn't have picked skilled.
[16:11.78]That was a mistake.
[16:13.32]I can fucking guarantee that to you.
[16:21.51]Gotta go up.
[16:23.49]Can't wait to beat this whole game on stream today.
[16:27.79]You guys thought that was a joke?
[16:29.99]Oh, he's friendly.
[16:42.53]I just keep watching other people die in front of me.
[16:46.21]Gotta say, it's not... It's not the best thing in the world.
[16:52.44]Everybody, every NPC I've been able to talk to says a sentence and then they instantly die.
[16:58.99]Can I have one of my friends stay alive for more than five fucking seconds?
[17:12.99]What's the tel- please tell me there's a sprint.
[17:17.99]I get the world building they're doing here, but where's my fucking time travel?
[17:32.02]Alpha suit detected.
[17:33.78]Okay, Dr. Aiden Crone located.
[17:37.26]Where is it?
[17:38.51]In here.
[17:48.79]Bad guy?
[17:50.49]Press B to melee.
[17:54.07]Why did I think that was gonna reach?
[17:55.68]Do I have fucking Slenderman arms?
[17:58.66]So wait, can I get down here and melee?
[17:59.96]That was easy.
[18:10.11]Remember, they're fucking zombies.
[18:12.47]Gotta shoot them in the head.
[18:18.08]I fucking missed a fantastic.
[18:20.00]Shoot the barrels, quick!
[18:28.05]I told you I knew how to play the game.
[18:29.89]I know how to shoot the barrels.
[18:30.91]I hit him in the head like three times.
[18:36.33]Well, you're a little late.
[18:46.48]Why don't you come over here?
[18:47.98]Get in line of sight so I can shoot the barrel.
[18:53.62]I got him.
[18:53.96]I actually killed him.
[18:56.06]Okay.
[18:57.46]Well, that guy's dead.
[19:00.71]Now what?
[19:01.37]Here we go.
[19:07.01]Ammo, ammo.
[19:07.73]Okay, I thought that was a dismembered person.
[19:10.93]That's just a... It's...
[19:18.31]Not a dismembered person.
[19:19.37]It's a fire hydrant.
[19:20.23]Everybody calm down.
[19:26.75]Press right-click to mini-zoom with unscoped weapons.
[19:34.29]They call it... Are you calling it mini-zoom?
[19:36.71]What are my other weapons?
[19:37.79]I kind of... Just use the pistol.
[19:38.85]It's more fun.
[19:46.01]That's...
[19:48.07]Come on, do it.
[19:48.59]You do it too.
[19:49.47]Do the same thing.
[19:51.21]Do the spaghetti ragdoll person off the edge.
[19:53.27]There he goes!
[19:57.45]Ragdolls will never not be funny.
[20:06.26]Bad guys?
[20:07.28]Good guys?
[20:07.70]Ah, bad guys.
[20:08.62]We're gonna go this way.
[20:10.68]Come on!
[20:17.83]Come on I Got like I got I got comfortable Where's that gonna put me fuck I got fucking comfortable again.
[20:28.69]I just didn't Please but thank God alright.
[20:37.87]We're not gonna get comfortable Let's just get it done
[20:49.57]Not skilled.
[20:53.46]Alright, we're okay.
[20:55.36]One more guy over here.
[21:00.05]What the hell is going on?
[21:07.44]Now, yeah, now you can see the spaghetti joke again.
[21:09.16]Spaghetti people.
[21:10.80]Hey, Gummy Monk, thanks for the five dollars.
[21:12.58]Great voice acting, huh?
[21:13.57]So did you ever try out Mountain Blade?
[21:15.11]I did not.
[21:16.43]I have not tried Mountain Blade yet.
[21:19.49]Not yet.
[21:21.11]Also, thank you to Buster Boy.
[21:22.17]He was the one that gave the ten bucks.
[21:23.47]Both you guys.
[21:25.71]The guy up there.
[21:26.29]Oh, I've got to remember the people that come over there.
[21:31.02]See, they just appear out of nowhere.
[21:32.28]They blend in with the world.
[21:39.39]I don't know how many times I have to go back and forth and miss a person, but it's okay.
[21:42.46]We're good.
[21:44.34]Where?
[21:44.58]I'm gonna die.
[21:50.30]Holy shit, this is the most infuriating thing.
[21:52.14]I can't see anything.
[21:54.96]Why does it have to give me drugs when I have low health?
[21:57.58]Please don't do that.
[22:05.99]Where did that guy just come from?
[22:07.27]That guy... This is... This is... Ah!
[22:11.93]He's back again!
[22:12.85]Why are you impossible to... Why is this guy fucking impossible to kill?
[22:17.04]Eat this!
[22:20.92]Oh.
[22:25.28]Can't go that fast, because they just... Oh, okay.
[22:32.19]Hahaha.
[22:35.68]Well, that was easy enough, apparently.
[22:37.12]Another guy?
[22:38.32]No.
[22:43.00]How do I get out of the Half-Life level?
[22:46.02]What is that?
[22:47.50]Friendlies?
[22:48.83]Finally, good.
[22:52.73]That's no way to greet... somebody.
[22:57.87]Hey, watch.
[22:58.17]Guarantee this guy dies.
[22:59.27]I guaran-fucking-tee it.
[23:01.23]Just met this NPC, he's dead in five seconds.
[23:08.01]I say one word and then die on camera.
[23:13.35]Or maybe he doesn't.
[23:14.35]Does this guy have plot armor?
[23:15.69]I don't know.
[23:20.87]We'll see.
[23:21.23]We'll see.
[23:21.53]Am I supposed to... Oh, I just have to shoot him in the... I gotta shoot him in, like, the fucking blue penises.
[23:26.08]Okay.
[23:28.20]Maybe not.
[23:29.44]Yeah, alright.
[23:29.98]That's what you'd have to do.
[23:43.78]What the fuck?
[23:46.61]We're not going back to the beginning of the level, are we?
[23:49.93]Oh, it's showing me everything.
[23:51.11]Oh no, we're going to go back to my birth.
[24:05.45]Alright.
[24:09.14]Here we are at the beginning of the game.
[24:12.92]That was a fun game.
[24:14.78]We got to the end.
[24:15.32]We just have to keep doing that.
[24:16.14]We have to get to the end of that mission as fast as we can.
[24:21.96]Thank you, Swiggity.
[24:23.92]And, uh, Wardy.
[24:26.62]Time travel week.
[24:27.44]Yeah, I would hope so.
[24:32.29]100 player servers in Mountain Blade?
[24:33.53]That sounds insane.
[24:37.33]Wait, do I have to do this again?
[24:44.62]You have a new objective.
[24:47.66]Press LB to activate time shift.
[24:49.74]Your suit will select the optimal power to use.
[24:55.13]Slow motion.
[24:58.23]Okay.
[24:58.99]And this pause.
[25:01.15]Okay.
[25:01.45]Okay.
[25:17.86]Oh, I was supposed to go around.
[25:19.20]I was supposed to go around the corner.
[25:20.74]Fuckin' t- Oh, that's alright, we can time shift.
[25:27.49]I get it, okay.
[25:31.69]We can just rewind, don't worry.
[25:38.71]It's just Deadeye in first person.
[25:41.97]Alright, here we go.
[25:47.85]Hey, you heard it!
[25:49.89]He's got a fucking gun!
[25:52.55]Oh, fuck.
[25:55.33]Wait, why is he over here?
[25:56.73]Why am I so small?
[26:00.98]Oh, I was crouching.
[26:01.78]Okay.
[26:06.66]To manually select time powers, tap X for slow, Y for stop, or B for reverse while holding left bumper.
[26:18.38]How far back can you go?
[26:19.18]That don't seem very far.
[26:22.82]No, it's not gonna work.
[26:29.82]I'm gonna try to blow it up and then rewind.
[26:37.15]So B is rewind.
[26:38.21]Y is pause.
[26:41.15]Okay.
[26:47.25]Travel before when I started to not... Travel before when I started playing this game, but don't.
[26:53.51]Ah, come on back.
[26:54.15]Let's do that again.
[26:56.17]I didn't like how... I want to see how you jumped over that again.
[26:58.33]Alright, go.
[27:02.39]Nice.
[27:05.32]Oh, that's a... That's a... That's a... Okay.
[27:07.56]I feel like I can have a lot of fun with that.
[27:08.94]Okay.
[27:19.37]That's so unfair.
[27:21.17]Now he's gonna die, right?
[27:22.61]Yeah.
[27:23.19]Okay, cool.
[27:25.97]Hehe, I see some funny jokes here.
[27:35.90]All I see is dust.
[27:40.66]No, that's not good.
[27:41.76]Turn it off.
[27:48.24]Am I going to play Dream Daddy?
[27:50.86]Uh, no.
[27:52.44]No, I'm not going to play the everybody please play me video game.
[27:56.64]I'm going to play Time Shift.
[28:00.42]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:01.50]Back it up.
[28:01.78]Back it up.
[28:04.65]Where do I go here?
[28:06.57]I just like jumped over the fucking rock.
[28:07.95]Okay, that was kind of cool.
[28:10.85]Why couldn't I rewind?
[28:16.38]Rewind back to when I was happy.
[28:17.82]Wait, what?
[28:20.28]Oh, very easily, we're gonna just do this.
[28:23.96]Bye.
[28:28.27]That's... Why don't more games have cheats like this?
[28:31.23]This is just... I can just go in the console and turn the game off.
[28:37.11]I need to do that again, right?
[28:38.03]Like get up the stairs?
[28:38.67]Get up the ladder?
[28:47.64]Alright, first B. Oh, yeah, whatever.
[28:50.74]Play time splitters for a whole week?
[28:52.90]Uh, no.
[28:56.33]Wait, what's going on?
[28:57.13]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[29:00.77]We're fine.
[29:01.47]See?
[29:02.15]This didn't happen yet.
[29:04.43]How long ago did this happen?
[29:06.49]I don't think I have enough time to do that.
[29:12.97]I can't save us.
[29:14.31]I can't save us.
[29:15.19]I would love to save...
[29:17.93]I can save this guy.
[29:21.14]I don't think I can save him permanently though.
[29:26.70]Oh shit, hold on.
[29:29.92]Okay, wait.
[29:30.42]Okay, so you go back, run past.
[29:32.40]Okay.
[29:37.47]I do rewind and I run down and then let it go.
[29:39.81]Okay, I get it.
[29:40.45]That's psychotic.
[29:45.26]Save him.
[29:51.74]Alright, here we go.
[30:00.44]Ah, nope!
[30:01.28]We're gonna rewind.
[30:02.11]And we're gonna make it.
[30:07.11]Unfortunately, we cannot change the fate of these two guys.
[30:11.75]They will always be dead.
[30:12.77]Doesn't mean we couldn't try.
[30:17.39]Is this a shotgun?
[30:23.38]That's a loud fucking game.
[30:24.84]That guy was so confused.
[30:40.45]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[30:41.49]What's going on?
[30:42.29]Pause it.
[30:42.75]Pause it.
[30:43.21]Pause it.
[30:43.59]Pause it.
[30:44.79]Pause it.
[30:45.16]Pause the game.
[30:45.68]Pause the game.
[30:46.88]Let me get to a better spot.
[30:49.82]Holy shit.
[30:50.52]There's so many people.
[30:51.06]I gotta throw a grenade.
[30:51.66]How do you throw grenades?
[30:58.79]How do you throw grenades?
[31:02.43]Did it teach me how to throw grenades yet?
[31:05.48]I want to see, I want to see.
[31:16.60]Get up, get up and run.
[31:19.45]What?
[31:20.63]That didn't kill... That didn't kill any person?
[31:28.08]There's like fucking 10 people in this room, what?
[31:29.84]I can't fucking... That's great, it is.
[31:33.02]Watch out grenade!
[32:04.23]This is fun, come on.
[32:05.55]This game came out like in 2007.
[32:07.41]This is fun.
[32:08.17]That guy was putting his hands up.
[32:14.61]He's still trying to shoot me.
[32:18.09]I want to know the speedrun tactics for this game.
[32:19.77]You know what I'm saying?
[32:22.51]There are some group of people that have found awesome tactics to speedrun this.
[32:26.35]Why am I saying tactics?
[32:28.53]I'm gonna get out of here.
[32:35.62]I just got crushed under the door and it didn't kill me.
[32:40.86]And...
[33:08.17]Oh, I didn't get his gun.
[33:11.38]Wait, wait a second!
[33:12.76]Wow!
[33:17.04]Where did the other guys come from?
[33:18.30]I have to just grab all their weapons and just see what happens.
[33:30.05]Skilled.
[33:32.05]Sorry, there's a quick save every fucking 12 seconds.
[33:36.09]Oh, no it's not.
[33:42.50]What's fucking going on?
[33:49.67]Person in the room still over here.
[33:51.19]Okay, there we go.
[33:51.97]Give me your gun.
[33:53.55]Oh, he picked up another gun!
[34:08.81]Okay, hold on.
[34:10.15]I'm gonna keep taking guns away from these people.
[34:12.05]Move one.
[34:22.26]Okay, this guy's fucking dead.
[34:29.22]Give me his gun!
[34:31.02]Give me his gun!
[34:37.94]Alright, the door falls.
[34:38.93]Alright, this part.
[34:40.07]Give me the gun.
[34:41.89]He actually does put his hands out.
[34:45.57]Uh... What do I do?
[34:47.85]I could just... Can I, like...
[35:09.53]I had to, right?
[35:11.00]Handcuff him?
[35:12.50]There's no handcuffing in this game.
[35:36.68]He just like did like a fucking backwards.
[35:38.74]He did like a backwards jump into the pool move.
[35:50.86]How quickly did this gimmick wears the fuck off?
[35:53.08]I don't know.
[35:55.16]Like I've played the whole game at this point, but I don't care.
[35:57.45]I'm still here.
[36:05.05]Jesus Christ, dude!
[36:11.11]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait!
[36:14.95]Are there people surrounding me?
[36:15.99]He's still fucking alive!
[36:20.60]Now he's not.
[36:24.82]Where's my gun?
[36:26.02]Hmm.
[36:31.33]Here we go.
[36:31.77]Ready?
[36:32.39]I'm going to get all their guns.
[36:33.43]3, 2, 1.
[36:35.95]Skilled gamer.
[36:41.61]Give me the gun.
[36:46.56]Shit.
[36:48.52]Alright, I got it.
[37:01.45]That guy got Judge Dredd.
[37:05.51]Yeah, I killed Judge Dredd.
[37:08.15]Lethal electrical source detected.
[37:13.01]I can't, I gotta, I gotta, I can't jump through this.
[37:14.84]There's like lightning and shit arcing everywhere.
[37:19.24]Should I rewind time to when there was no electricity in the world?
[37:24.42]I'm gonna have to go back a long way.
[37:28.79]No, that don't do it.
[37:29.45]Okay, we gotta go this way apparently.
[37:37.24]No, what?
[37:37.52]How do I get by this?
[37:40.04]Oh, I get it.
[37:40.42]No, I gotta freeze time.
[37:46.59]Ain't no electricity.
[37:50.25]When you freeze time.
[37:59.55]You get over here, I'm coming.
[38:00.87]Don't die immediately when I get there, except you're going to.
[38:03.13]What the fuck is happening?
[38:17.44]Oh.
[38:19.34]Okay.
[38:22.87]I feel like, okay, the rewind mechanic, it doesn't even, like, need to be in the game.
[38:28.39]It's gonna be used in very specific puzzle pieces of the game, isn't it?
[38:38.42]No rewind.
[38:39.20]I mean, there's no reason to do a rewind.
[38:45.98]Oh my god, please, come on!
[38:47.92]Come on!
[38:48.26]Yes!
[38:54.18]That was perfect.
[38:55.48]A sticky grenade.
[38:57.61]Oh, that was great.
[38:58.63]What a fun game.
[39:00.40]Imagine how much fun you would have had in this game like fucking 10 years ago.
[39:09.04]What does this get for a score?
[39:12.57]Whatever it was, it deserves to be higher.
[39:18.85]I know he's gonna drop the building on us and I'm gonna have to rewind and run, right?
[39:27.06]There we go.
[39:27.52]Rebound.
[39:27.92]Got it.
[39:28.16]And then I gotta get... No, he's running fast.
[39:37.49]Where do I go here?
[39:38.63]Electricity down there.
[39:39.57]Turn it off!
[39:43.61]Oh, shit.
[39:44.19]Get up.
[39:44.47]Up, up, up, up, up, up, up, up.
[39:45.45]Turn off the electricity.
[39:48.05]What do I do?
[39:51.21]Unstable surface detected.
[39:52.47]What are you talking about?
[39:55.12]Up there?
[39:55.84]I don't know where to go.
[40:02.19]Just tell me I was on a not stable surface.
[40:05.43]Am I fucked down here?
[40:06.21]I don't think I can get up here.
[40:16.25]No, I can't.
[40:17.99]What do I do then?
[40:22.98]Oh, there we go.
[40:24.66]Now what?
[40:26.50]Up here.
[40:28.88]And then where?
[40:29.76]Like down here?
[40:30.42]Into the pipe?
[40:33.35]Looks like it.
[40:33.89]Oh.
[40:36.07]Alright.
[40:41.32]We made it.
[40:59.84]Get out of here!
[41:01.72]Because you have one chance to run.
[41:03.08]Well, you lost it.
[41:03.94]Don't go.
[41:07.66]Um... No, that's... Well, this might be funny.
[41:12.61]No, not funny.
[41:13.33]He's not... I brought that guy back just to feel pain again.
[41:18.79]That's all I did.
[41:26.76]Mario?
[41:27.56]What Mario reference did I do here?
[41:29.34]Oh shit, that hurts.
[41:36.16]He's dead, right?
[41:40.45]Yeah.
[41:43.55]Are we surprised that I'm having fun?
[41:49.03]I'm having fun right now.
[41:51.03]Should I not be?
[41:57.11]What's he shooting at?
[41:57.69]Flash grenade.
[42:04.39]I should not be.
[42:18.29]Nice dive.
[42:19.11]I gotta see that again.
[42:24.89]Come on.
[42:25.73]Let me see it again.
[42:28.57]I can't go back that far.
[42:29.65]Where's my fucking double juice?
[42:34.23]Why would you do a front flip?
[42:36.49]There's no point to that.
[42:38.25]He's got me in his sights.
[42:39.33]He could have taken me down.
[42:40.30]He could have got the fucking Nobel Prize for taking out the psycho with the suit that makes time travel.
[42:45.66]No, he had to do a front flip.
[42:55.57]Wait, wait, no, no, no, no.
[42:56.37]Go back.
[42:57.45]Go back.
[42:58.44]I want you back up there again.
[43:00.93]God damn it.
[43:04.47]Ah, damn it!
[43:06.95]I wish I had an unlimited supply.
[43:12.81]How do I put the, uh... I want it on... This is a way to make it so I can just activate in one, right?
[43:23.69]I wanted to impress his favorite streamer.
[43:30.67]I love how that grenade hit him in the fucking face.
[43:33.57]And all he did was... Hey, hey, it's me.
[43:37.62]Hey, you gotta save Mills, right?
[43:39.10]Well, you're not gonna be able to save me because I'm gonna instantly die.
[43:48.12]Come up here.
[43:49.32]Here comes the betrayal.
[43:53.42]Use the turret?
[44:04.74]Who's left?
[44:05.12]This guy?
[44:06.52]Easy.
[44:08.02]Guys, this is on skilled, by the way.
[44:09.57]Remember that.
[44:15.87]Oh, my.
[44:16.25]That guy got put into a blender.
[44:19.45]This is what happens if a person goes into a blender, guys.
[44:22.12]This is what happens to you.
[44:28.24]Forget about, like, a grenade.
[44:31.58]That guy just tripped.
[44:34.60]Incoming threat detected.
[44:36.10]Why does it keep doing that?
[44:41.32]Take him out.
[44:45.76]Don't fall back.
[44:46.30]We can't handle this.
[44:48.76]Take it off the gun.
[44:53.32]Oh, shit!
[44:54.76]Here it comes!
[44:56.26]It's taken out the whole complex!
[44:59.33]Run!
[45:03.47]Hey, Dr. Freeman, go down this grate!
[45:06.87]That guy just did that by himself!
[45:16.69]I'm just processing that in my brain right now.
[45:19.59]Holy fuck, how strong is this guy?
[45:21.15]I want to be that guy.
[45:22.23]How do I change characters?
[45:30.08]God.
[45:34.33]Can't kill these guys.
[45:42.83]I like this game.
[45:43.45]I'm having fun.
[45:50.52]Thank you MooMeansMoo.
[45:55.42]IDP Captain.
[45:58.22]Cyrus Dexter.
[45:59.92]Spritech SSBM Icarus.
[46:02.40]Thank you guys for this.
[46:05.23]We're gonna open the floodgates on janky 10-year-old FPS games.
[46:09.28]I think it'd be funny, streamer, to see you play the first Red Steel game.
[46:13.36]I actually wanted to do that.
[46:15.04]I wanted to play Red.
[46:15.76]That's the one with the Wii where you hold the sword, right?
[46:19.59]No, he also says thanks to Holy Mac for the hilarious video today.
[46:24.39]Holy Mac is a very, very talented, talented editor.
[46:29.89]What did I miss?
[46:33.91]Here we go, it's my chance.
[46:35.91]It's my chance.
[46:36.39]It's my chance!
[46:41.09]Why am I... Who dropped that?
[46:47.14]I didn't drop that grenade, guys.
[46:48.62]He did.
[46:49.70]And his buddy just heard the loud noise and then put his hands over his ears.
[46:54.94]He didn't die from that.
[46:56.60]He just... It was too loud.
[46:59.69]Jesus Christ.
[47:02.81]It was a loud noise.
[47:15.58]Alright, let's do it.
[47:25.30]Slow motion is the best thing just because you can stay in it.
[47:30.57]Where's the other guy?
[47:38.98]Up top.
[47:40.94]Easy.
[47:43.56]Jupiter pukes?
[47:44.22]What happened?
[47:45.08]Did somebody say Jupiter?
[47:47.75]What's going on with the Jupiters?
[47:55.03]Guess you didn't even bounce.
[47:57.85]Alright, come on.
[47:58.45]I can do this, right?
[48:02.57]No, I can't.
[48:04.63]Just fuck it, whatever.
[48:06.81]There's a lot of people here.
[48:26.46]That guy's still alive.
[48:37.88]I actually got it!
[48:38.62]Wow, I'm surprised.
[48:39.47]Is he just walking forward?
[48:47.31]No.
[48:51.25]Right ahead.
[48:51.85]Alright, almost there.
[48:55.29]Can't wait to beat this whole game on screen.
[48:57.17]It's gonna be fun.
[49:01.22]I wish I could take your gun.
[49:12.40]I wonder if I get any cool weapons later.
[49:14.60]Alright, I have a new objective.
[49:19.51]Gotta go... Where would you like me?
[49:23.67]Oh, this way?
[49:24.17]Any electricity down here that I should know about?
[49:31.05]Am I gonna be okay?
[49:40.35]What the fuck is happening in this chat right now?
[49:43.86]What is going on?
[49:44.72]Well, you don't think I know how to do this?
[49:51.12]Come on.
[49:51.52]This is the easiest fucking thing you could have done for me, game.
[49:55.64]Watch this.
[49:59.38]Easy.
[50:02.70]The hardest puzzle ever.
[50:04.20]Gunfire is dying down.
[50:08.29]Just make it so only I can talk in chat.
[50:14.33]Are these bad guys?
[50:17.35]These are- How was I- I just heard people talking up here.
[50:23.28]Fucking come on.
[50:24.72]I was trying- I didn't- whatever.
[50:42.19]I was trying to do something interesting there and the dive just didn't work.
[50:51.35]Alright, let's go.
[50:51.95]Give me the gun!
[50:55.97]Why didn't it work?
[51:11.06]Guy moved so quick.
[51:12.96]Why couldn't I was holding X. Why can't I take the gun?
[51:24.37]That guy had a time suit as well that wasn't fair I
[51:40.06]Like, you can only do this like... Alright, we're not gonna try that again.
[51:42.96]Like, I guess you can only grab one gun every like... Holy shit, man.
[51:52.45]What the fuck?! !
[52:09.78]What?
[52:09.96]They just throw grenades!
[52:12.14]I'm going back in the fucking turtle hole.
[52:17.98]They just like dropped him down here.
[52:22.78]Dangled Mark by his legs.
[52:24.66]See if he can get a good look.
[52:26.02]Did this all happen?
[52:32.30]God.
[52:34.00]One of them eventually is gonna drop down here.
[52:42.31]I'm scared.
[52:42.65]I'm back.
[52:42.95]I'm going back.
[52:43.37]Go, go, go, go, go.
[52:44.23]Get back in there.
[52:45.87]Get in there.
[52:46.35]I'm going to wait until it's charged.
[52:57.59]And go.
[53:06.76]Disarmed.
[53:07.26]Yeah, I disarmed him.
[53:08.68]That's what I did.
[53:11.31]Did somebody just blow a meme horn?
[53:14.53]Is that what I actually just heard?
[53:23.77]Nice karate kick.
[53:24.57]It didn't fucking work.
[53:30.96]Two guys left.
[53:35.10]Last guy.
[53:42.82]Good to go.
[53:50.07]It was like that, like... Thank you BOM for the 10 bucks.
[54:03.29]Jerma, I love you.
[54:04.41]Well, thank you.
[54:06.65]Hey, you ain't so bad.
[54:12.91]We're gonna hide in here.
[54:14.45]There is no hiding in there.
[54:18.95]What's wrong with this guy?
[54:22.01]That guy just couldn't handle it anymore.
[54:23.09]What's wrong with that guy?
[54:24.64]People are just freaking out right now.
[54:38.97]Why is this guy acting like a fucking gorilla?
[54:40.93]That guy was just going on his knuckles.
[54:43.31]Did you see that?
[54:48.53]That was... Alright, hold on a minute.
[54:51.68]Die quick so I can do this.
[54:58.08]God damn it.
[55:09.88]Stop.
[55:10.34]Stop it.
[55:10.84]Stop it.
[55:11.28]Stop it.
[55:11.71]Stop it.
[55:12.33]Make this easy on yourself, please.
[55:13.83]Yeah.
[55:25.93]Didn't even see me.
[55:31.15]Keep breathing.
[55:36.61]I remember this game.
[55:37.57]I hated it.
[55:40.52]Lethal heat source.
[55:41.48]Oh no, watch out!
[55:42.56]Just freeze time and you're good to go.
[55:48.82]See?
[55:49.69]There's no oxygen when time is frozen, guys.
[55:54.73]Well, that one got me in the butt a little bit.
[55:56.53]And that one heated up my bum just a little.
[55:59.51]It's alright, it was only like a fourth degree burn on my ass.
[56:06.16]Baked flakes, thanks for the 20 bucks.
[56:09.57]I like this game.
[56:10.37]I like this game, said Jerma about every game he hates.
[56:14.02]That's not true.
[56:17.46]Look, I mean, it's a dumb gimmick, but... Who's to say that this might not turn into a fun game soon?
[56:23.28]Look, this is going to be fun.
[56:25.48]I promise you one thing.
[56:27.03]This, what you're about to see, is going to be fun.
[56:29.29]I promise.
[56:45.27]See?
[56:45.47]Wasn't that fun?
[56:47.03]Wasn't that fun?
[56:47.57]Dumb dead.
[56:52.37]It's so fun.
[57:06.92]No, I gotta do this dumb shit again.
[57:08.24]The slow motion... Is there oxygen in slow motion world?
[57:16.00]I guess so.
[57:16.50]I guess this is just enough.
[57:20.03]It is fun.
[57:20.57]Come on.
[57:28.35]Dun dun.
[57:29.59]See?
[57:29.93]Did you hear?
[57:30.52]It happened again.
[57:31.36]I hope you guys are hearing this.
[57:35.92]I hope I'm not going crazy.
[57:40.32]That like...
[57:44.78]Anything else I can do that's fun?
[57:46.86]For now, at least?
[57:47.48]I mean, I could have fun again.
[57:55.61]What's the party horn?
[58:00.63]This is the clown somewhere.
[58:07.64]Someone's blowing a party horn.
[58:13.37]It's a Jerma stream.
[58:14.51]That guy would not know.
[58:18.80]But he's going to blow up, so it don't matter.
[58:25.12]And the bread barrels don't blow up now.
[58:28.16]They've only been blowing up the whole game.
[58:29.76]Don't worry, guys.
[58:30.26]Alright, let's just go.
[58:40.71]What do I need to get to, is the question.
[58:44.82]Nice job shooting that open barrel.
[58:50.04]Sorry, you mean nice job shooting that flaming barrel.
[58:53.38]That barrel that is on fire.
[58:57.30]It's a flaming red barrel.
[58:59.62]You find me a video game that has a flaming red barrel that doesn't explode, and I'll give you a game that don't exist.
[59:13.19]Get in the tank?
[59:13.81]I don't think I can.
[59:14.63]Alright, we're going.
[59:21.05]We're going.
[59:22.12]Just get it.
[59:24.88]Did I hit him?
[59:25.86]It may not have.
[59:31.86]We're good.
[59:34.83]I think I caught... We found one timeshift.
[59:36.75]What do you mean?
[59:37.37]You think you found one that's timeshift?
[59:41.70]I'm running fast.
[59:42.48]Look at this matrix shit.
[59:43.42]That's cool.
[59:45.10]What a fun goddamn game.
[59:48.84]Oh, give me that.
[59:49.38]Give me, give me, give me.
[59:54.06]No, get off, get off, get off, get off, get off.
[60:08.41]I'm just trying to scare him.
[60:09.17]That's what I'm doing that for, guys.
[60:16.66]Where is he?
[60:17.15]Behind the pole?
[60:22.55]Holy shit, okay.
[60:30.52]That was actually kind of scary, because they threw a grenade at me.
[60:33.57]Why are they so smart?
[60:45.19]What am I supposed to do?
[60:45.83]Do I just have to sit on this thing?
[60:50.77]Incoming threat.
[60:51.75]Oh, yeah.
[60:52.61]Happy birthday!
[60:54.12]Happy birthday!
[60:56.92]It's always somebody's birthday in this game.
[61:01.82]Um... Oh.
[61:07.57]Did I get him?
[61:11.11]Did I get him?
[61:16.87]Suck that one back out.
[61:17.83]I don't wanna- I thought I was supposed to fight it.
[61:27.18]I really thought I was supposed to fight it.
[61:30.98]I sucked it- Alright, I did damage to myself, sucked it back out, and then killed me with it.
[61:35.87]That's exactly what just happened.
[61:37.81]Happy fucking birthday.
[61:44.84]Yeah, I'm just gonna make my time slow and run by it, right?
[61:54.50]Rewinding doesn't restore health.
[61:55.74]Yeah, so that's exactly what happened.
[61:58.36]So I just get... Get off.
[62:01.60]Get off it.
[62:02.40]Now what?
[62:02.78]I have to run by it?
[62:06.40]Apparently.
[62:08.62]Increased agility required.
[62:16.79]I'm really out of ammo.
[62:19.73]Are you really?
[62:21.35]Give me a break.
[62:22.29]I only need to wait.
[62:29.07]Why is this game so gray?
[62:31.61]It was made in 2006.
[62:32.15]Oh dear.
[62:42.33]Where?
[62:42.81]Where?
[62:43.71]Into the- into the subway!
[62:45.73]Into the subway!
[62:47.03]Whoo!
[62:47.99]Good.
[62:52.25]I think you guys are so just trigger-happy with the- Okay, well, I can't take his- Oh my god.
[63:08.64]Fucking skilled.
[63:09.40]I should've done casual.
[63:17.42]Pick me up a meatball sub down there.
[63:19.46]I don't want to do this shit again.
[63:20.62]Alright, we're not fucking around again.
[63:22.24]No, like, I'm gonna steal their gun out of their hands.
[63:24.46]Yeah.
[63:24.88]I just, I'm moving.
[63:34.11]Go ahead, blow the wall.
[63:45.45]Happy birthday.
[63:47.28]Blow the wall.
[63:50.44]I know you would like to blow this wall.
[63:51.60]Go, go, go.
[63:53.36]That hurt a lot.
[63:55.10]And I walked into the fire, apparently.
[63:56.56]And the fire was enough to almost kill me.
[64:00.01]And then this is how to bullet together.
[64:02.13]I don't know why I even have this gun on.
[64:06.21]I'm back to full health.
[64:07.93]Here we go.
[64:20.25]Easy.
[64:20.59]Does the guy just call me Handsome?
[64:22.08]Oh, no.
[64:22.30]My name is Handsome.
[64:24.46]I thought he said my name was Handsome.
[64:25.74]Oh, hey.
[64:26.42]What's going on, Handsome?
[64:27.96]You're a real fucking handsome guy.
[64:30.42]Hey, is that handsome guy still down there?
[64:31.96]All units, engage.
[64:32.74]Stop!
[64:50.90]God damn it.
[64:51.48]I thought it was a shotgun No, no, no, no, god damn it.
[64:57.12]I thought I was what I took his gun.
[64:59.16]I I tried Don't put me back at the tank part.
[65:02.90]I'm gonna be fucking really not happy about that if it's that's the case Please don't do that to me Left trigger is the double like shot with the shotgun.
[65:17.05]I grabbed the gun out of his hands and decided to use it and
[65:20.41]And left trigger is the fucking grenade.
[65:22.34]So... Oh, I'm... I'm actually upset about that.
[65:27.38]I don't want to do this again.
[65:29.50]I'm actually going to be quiet and just play the fucking game.
[65:36.01]Give me a break.
[65:39.27]Can I throw this weapon into the ground?
[65:49.09]I gotta increase agility.
[65:51.23]I'm fine.
[65:51.77]Guy's gonna come down, isn't he?
[65:54.61]That guy's scratching his ass.
[66:10.64]Alright, good.
[66:11.20]I think I'm being followed.
[66:13.36]What?
[66:13.54]What are you going to do?
[66:14.58]Go find another one.
[66:15.36]There's like two guns.
[66:16.20]There's a gun right next to you.
[66:18.18]I swear to God.
[66:18.70]Why?
[66:18.98]I want to use this.
[66:23.31]What is it?
[66:40.70]what I keep taking the gun and I forget that like me taking it is I'm using the gun that's so much
[67:06.40]Take that!
[67:09.05]Did he just pick it up?
[67:10.49]I thought that guy was going to pick the grenade up off the ground and look at it.
[67:18.55]Hold on, what happened there?
[67:26.12]Oh no, a grenade!
[67:27.14]Let me take a look at it and see what brand it is.
[67:29.26]Um...
[67:35.33]I don't want to die here.
[67:37.15]Where's the way to get back up?
[67:41.77]I don't know.
[67:47.10]Thank God.
[67:47.64]Ooh!
[67:50.50]We win.
[67:52.82]Very good.
[67:56.12]That's two achievements.
[67:59.62]The noises in this game are driving me insane.
[68:02.04]Sorry.
[68:09.03]How much longer do you think until we get out?
[68:15.56]What?
[68:15.74]These are bad guys.
[68:26.55]Something's wrong.
[68:40.21]Yeah, something's wrong.
[68:41.46]Something is wrong.
[68:43.12]Yeah.
[68:44.72]Take cover, you fool!
[68:46.88]You fool.
[68:48.96]When was the last time you guys called somebody a fool in a life-and-death situation?
[68:54.17]Okay, through that.
[69:02.59]Okay.
[69:09.11]Take cover, you fool!
[69:13.20]Take cover, you obviously written dialog!
[69:19.50]Wait, hold on.
[69:19.90]That was pretty... That was cool.
[69:20.74]I want to see that again.
[69:26.18]Nice.
[69:38.07]Oh dear.
[69:39.07]Look at how many there are.
[69:43.25]I just wanted to throw a grenade.
[69:46.10]Honestly.
[69:46.80]Jesus fucking Mary.
[69:49.90]Jesus Mary.
[69:54.02]They just throw up enemies.
[69:58.35]Those guys just came.
[69:58.97]Those are ants that came out of an anthill.
[70:08.96]Oh, hey, remember this?
[70:10.64]Oh, no!
[70:11.78]I'm gonna grab his weapon.
[70:13.00]You know, fuck the jokes.
[70:17.80]Fuck these jokes.
[70:18.48]We're going.
[70:18.92]Let's go.
[70:23.03]Do I have, like, a rifle or something?
[70:24.43]No, I don't.
[70:24.97]Give me the dumb rifle.
[70:30.49]Who's this guy?
[70:33.39]You recognize this guy?
[70:34.23]He's not part of the engineering team.
[70:39.67]I'm gonna go this way.
[70:45.56]So this whole time... Is there a sprint in this game?
[70:49.24]I don't think so.
[70:50.62]See, watch this.
[70:51.10]Ready?
[70:52.74]Here comes like the fucking 2,000 enemies.
[70:56.81]I'm just gonna go buy it.
[70:58.69]Red barrels!
[71:00.65]Told you!
[71:08.34]Sitting down what the fuck is going on shit there he is We're good Nothing this way keep going
[71:38.21]Remember, always shoot the red barrels in every game.
[71:40.05]It's true.
[71:50.48]Die.
[71:54.04]Alright, we're good.
[71:56.78]Why don't I play a better game?
[72:00.45]Because I'm playing Time Shift.
[72:02.99]This is a classic from the 2000s.
[72:08.75]There he goes.
[72:12.23]No shit.
[72:19.72]Is it attached to me?
[72:20.62]It's on me, isn't it?
[72:21.46]I don't know who the fuck it was.
[72:25.52]Drop the satchel.
[72:47.71]Look, don't you guys understand?
[72:49.65]It's going to be this for the rest of the game.
[72:53.39]Where is this guy?
[72:57.49]We're going to get different versions of this.
[73:05.53]Just wait till we get to use our time powers more.
[73:07.27]This is just a tutorial.
[73:10.13]We're like almost done with the tutorial.
[73:11.49]And then we're gonna actually get to really utilize our time powers.
[73:28.98]We're gonna meet Dr. Breen.
[73:30.56]He's gonna be behind one of these doors.
[73:32.35]Sitting at his computer.
[73:33.13]He's gonna be doing his like podcast.
[73:37.30]Right now he's doing a stream.
[73:38.77]And then we're going to fucking time shift him.
[73:45.99]Concealed threat detected.
[73:47.27]Somebody's like invisible.
[73:49.33]That's fine.
[73:51.24]We just have to get out here and we're going to make it to the next level.
[73:53.22]We're going to go... Well, there's a... No, not this guy.
[73:56.44]We already did this.
[73:57.06]What have you heard?
[74:13.12]I don't want to listen to this guy anymore.
[74:15.12]What do I have to do?
[74:18.00]I should have listened to him.
[74:20.12]I absolutely should have listened to him.
[74:22.41]He was not lying.
[74:23.19]Everybody else was lying.
[74:24.95]This guy was telling the truth.
[74:27.85]So, we're going to go ahead and do this.
[74:34.92]And we're out.
[74:38.76]He's still shooting up here.
[74:42.48]Well, I was supposed to go down, and I went up.
[74:45.26]So, we're dead.
[74:45.70]Uh, that's fun.
[74:47.12]We're gonna restart it.
[74:49.84]Well, maybe I can... I might be able to get up by it.
[74:55.59]Might be.
[75:00.61]Ah!
[75:03.65]I have, like, increased agility, and it doesn't work.
[75:05.37]Is this door open?
[75:06.45]That door doesn't open.
[75:08.22]Oh, God.
[75:10.36]Am I supposed to be doing this?
[75:15.45]Am I going to drop down and destroy this thing?
[75:26.05]Oh.
[75:29.82]I think, no, I guess I am supposed to do this.
[75:33.32]And eventually make it around to here.
[75:36.69]Alright, I did it.
[75:39.27]No, I didn't.
[75:40.28]Yeah, I didn't.
[75:41.06]Alright, let's move out of the way.
[75:42.26]Okay.
[75:42.58]I gotta go this way, so get out of the way.
[76:11.10]Get the fuck out of the way.
[76:14.62]Alright, so I was just a little- I just had to nudge him a little and he gets out of the way.
[76:22.60]I would have played the shit out of this as a kid.
[76:25.76]Yeah, this would be fun.
[76:28.12]It is fun.
[76:31.94]See?
[76:32.46]I told you the tutorial was about to be over.
[76:34.78]Watch this.
[76:40.25]Fuck the guy eating a snack.
[76:41.99]Boom.
[76:43.29]Boom.
[76:45.90]And one guy over here didn't even know what fucking happened.
[76:51.74]And we... Go in, go in the fucking ooze.
[76:57.38]What?
[76:59.14]That wasn't what I needed to do.
[77:00.54]Is that a guy's head?
[77:04.18]Holy shit.
[77:05.64]Holy shit.
[77:07.96]The guy's still alive.
[77:10.47]What?!
[77:16.34]This dude on the fucking machine gun!
[77:20.52]Oh my god.
[77:21.30]I shot that guy like 300 times and he got blown up by a fucking grenade and was still alive.
[77:35.40]Oh, that just fucking scared me.
[77:41.02]Play something decent.
[77:43.58]Well, how about this?
[77:44.88]I'm gonna play whatever the fuck I wanna play and we can either watch or we won't!
[77:53.69]How does that sound?
[77:54.87]Does that sound like a fucking plan to you?
[77:58.95]Give me the gun, give me the gun.
[78:15.11]That guy's still alive.
[78:16.89]Good job with the grenade roll.
[78:18.77]I just got fucking zapped.
[78:28.54]Look, I can do it too.
[78:29.30]I don't understand how many bullets this guy has to take.
[78:41.67]Before he dies, finally.
[78:43.69]Holy God.
[78:44.88]Wait, is it a good guy?
[78:49.60]Okay.
[78:51.84]These guys are coming out of this.
[78:54.42]Ugly and... What the fuck was that?
[79:00.91]Oh, God.
[79:01.89]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[79:14.30]He's gonna die from this, right?
[79:15.40]I love how I decided to turn that guy into fucking SpaghettiOs.
[79:17.76]You can get in the building through the garage.
[79:41.46]I'm gonna give you money and sub, but I don't want to sub to a crazy crackhead streamer.
[79:46.30]What?
[79:50.42]Oh, is it really that big of a deal that I'm playing Timeshift?
[79:53.94]What is, what's going on right now?
[79:58.02]Guys, guys, you do realize, you do realize that I streamed, like, look at like the last like few games I've streamed.
[80:05.56]I streamed like the fucking Wall-E game.
[80:08.44]And we're, and we're surprised that I'm playing Timeshift?
[80:17.95]Is this a surprise?
[80:21.01]Save the damn game.
[80:33.64]This is this potential here for a fun game.
[80:37.44]We're just going to get out of the tutorial.
[80:38.86]Alright, we're good.
[80:53.14]What building are you talking about?
[80:56.72]Back to fucking Wally.
[81:00.80]Is this down?
[81:01.57]Where am I supposed to go?
[81:04.29]Can I jump up that?
[81:16.02]Cook's gonna have our asses if we don't get you in that building.
[81:18.78]Now move!
[81:21.29]What is he... What building are you talking about?
[81:23.55]Like, in this building?
[81:38.96]Okay.
[81:39.94]I guess we're going in this building.
[81:41.90]All the way back here.
[81:47.57]There we go.
[81:50.45]Wait.
[81:50.77]Oh, okay.
[81:51.25]We're going to turn it off.
[81:55.27]Which one is deactivated?
[81:56.23]This one?
[81:57.69]That one's activated, though.
[81:59.12]Alright, well, here we go.
[82:10.34]Hey!
[82:10.88]Look at that.
[82:12.84]There's another one.
[82:24.65]Almost there.
[82:26.49]Oh.
[82:34.42]Streamer tops... Streamer stops time, he shits his pants.
[82:40.73]You know, I could shit my pants.
[82:44.29]I sound like I have way too many time.
[82:50.41]If the game doesn't get, like... There's a lot of fucking people coming here.
[82:56.81]If it's more of this in, like, another 20 or 30 minutes, then maybe, yeah.
[83:00.44]But I wanted to play it.
[83:01.30]I wanted to check it out.
[83:02.86]And that grenade blew up really quick here.
[83:05.46]Way, way too quickly.
[83:06.76]Shoot the red barrels always.
[83:07.78]Okay.
[83:19.57]Boom.
[83:19.97]Come on, explode him.
[83:21.05]Come on.
[83:27.20]God damn it.
[83:27.80]I'm just going to run to him.
[83:38.77]Die.
[83:40.58]Come on, please.
[83:41.64]I don't want to do this again.
[83:45.13]Of course.
[83:45.51]Oh, that killed him.
[83:49.19]That fucking killed him.
[83:50.79]Who... I don't even know.
[83:51.99]I throw it and then he throw it.
[83:52.95]I'm not even sure if that's the same one.
[83:59.52]How did you get up there?
[84:00.80]What?
[84:09.88]These people are just, like, appearing out of nowhere.
[84:11.70]That guy exploded.
[84:23.68]No, please, don't throw a grenade.
[84:25.34]No grenades, no grenades.
[84:29.28]Alright, we're good.
[84:32.85]Get up.
[84:40.31]Red Dead Future.
[84:41.31]Alright, once we get down here... We'll see what the deal is.
[84:50.55]I'm gonna have to rewind time or something, right?
[84:58.57]No?
[84:59.45]There's no gimmick on this one, okay.
[85:01.17]Alright.
[85:06.99]Cigarette spaghetti!
[85:09.87]Cigarette Spaghetti gave $50.
[85:12.93]Thank you, Cigarette Spaghetti.
[85:14.05]And says, if you stop playing this game, I will rewind these bits.
[85:21.82]Well, thank you.
[85:23.48]I'm just trying to give it a chance.
[85:26.96]I'm just trying to give it a chance.
[85:29.16]And look, look.
[85:30.06]Listen, listen, listen.
[85:31.58]Look at this.
[85:34.47]Let me tell you something.
[85:37.67]Look at this.
[85:40.28]Alright, so... Is my character just saying that shit?
[85:49.84]That's the best piece of ass I've had in a long time?
[85:52.80]I'm the only person in this room.
[85:55.98]Who is he talking about?
[86:00.93]What?
[86:05.39]Okay.
[86:08.55]So...
[86:12.02]Yeah, I'm looking back at, like, some of the games I've played over the last, like, month.
[86:18.74]We played... We played Duck Dynasty.
[86:25.21]We played The Bunker.
[86:26.59]The... The Bunker was, like, the fucking worst game I've ever played in my life.
[86:34.33]When something about time shift is, like, causing everybody, like... It's causing everybody to go into, like, a conniption.
[86:47.97]Let's see.
[86:48.21]What's my like... He's still talking.
[86:56.57]There's got to be a guy behind here, right?
[86:58.25]Like there has to be like just some dude.
[87:04.56]What do you want the fuck?
[87:09.28]This has to be somebody up through this wall, right?
[87:21.70]It was these guys?
[87:25.58]These guys were just like death talking about.
[87:28.22]It was these two guys?
[87:29.36]This is the best piece of ass I've had in a long time apparently.
[87:47.05]That's the best piece of ass.
[87:49.09]But anyways, thank you, cigarette, for your... Turn this fucking alarm off.
[87:55.75]And we're about to get in the car.
[87:58.57]All you guys that were saying next, we're about to drive a forklift.
[88:02.02]God damn it, no we're not.
[88:04.12]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[88:05.00]Do not let this fucking guy get up there.
[88:06.76]Oh!
[88:18.07]That was weird.
[88:18.57]Okay.
[88:18.73]Does this thing need to be activated?
[88:23.05]No.
[88:25.96]Like, sometimes you just have to trust in the dumb game.
[88:32.52]Trying to shoot those barrels from here and it's not gonna work.
[88:35.14]Yeah, it's... Damn, that's a lot.
[88:47.60]Next, because no forklift.
[88:54.66]Wow.
[88:55.20]You would just... How am I going to know where?
[89:02.15]He's still alive, somehow.
[89:03.55]Don't ask me how.
[89:06.75]Ow.
[89:14.73]Please, the pillar blocked the whole thing.
[89:23.56]Another car.
[89:24.18]Where is it?
[89:29.40]Why did I do that?
[89:30.20]There's no reason to do that.
[89:31.62]Was there?
[89:32.06]Was there a reason to do that?
[89:42.34]Wait, why?
[89:44.02]Why did you just drive into the wall?
[89:54.06]And you guys wanted me to fucking change games?
[89:56.48]Do you see the potential here?
[89:57.78]There's a lot of potential.
[90:00.00]And we're just like in the stupid factory right now.
[90:04.21]But that doesn't mean that we're not gonna get out of the factory.
[90:08.35]I just tried to save his life.
[90:13.57]Alright, so when I fucking rewound, I guess I like scrambled that guy's brains that was in the car.
[90:20.26]That guy was on the way out.
[90:21.36]What the fuck?
[90:31.26]Why did that explode?
[90:34.45]What the fuck happened?
[90:36.11]Why did that car explode?
[90:37.53]Things are getting fucking weird, man.
[90:39.01]I need to see.
[90:42.95]What's with these things just exploding?
[90:46.13]More explosions.
[90:49.44]Why?
[90:53.32]Can I get in?
[91:06.09]I just gave that guy a beard.
[91:09.85]Okay.
[91:10.83]He's gone.
[91:15.75]I'm good, just gonna go around.
[91:21.62]Pull this lever.
[91:23.72]What?
[91:23.96]Oh, okay.
[91:24.46]I get it.
[91:25.32]Oh.
[91:46.74]Oh, no, I do get it.
[91:47.60]Okay.
[91:52.84]Okay.
[91:53.96]What?
[91:58.50]So, rewind it.
[92:04.35]What an interesting mechanic that was.
[92:05.97]That's the best piece of ass I've ever had.
[92:16.37]Oh, perfect.
[92:16.85]I can fucking Batman these guys, right?
[92:20.55]Watch this.
[92:20.87]Um...
[92:43.02]Anybody see how many times I shot that guy directly into the chest?
[92:48.66]Don't ask me.
[92:52.04]Just like Batman.
[92:58.31]I don't know what happened.
[93:18.60]Oh, he's trying to do something cheeky there.
[93:23.79]Well, let's just win.
[93:36.96]Alright, so I was testing something there.
[93:39.78]Even if it's paused, no matter what, you cannot take two guns right after.
[93:45.02]One after the other, you can't do it.
[94:00.53]Thanks for putting the doctor shotgun out.
[94:03.53]No, we're good.
[94:08.73]Where the fuck did you come from?
[94:10.21]Let's be real.
[94:13.87]That guy has one of these suits.
[94:15.93]That's the only other explanation.
[94:28.16]Maybe the clip needs to not be full?
[94:29.64]That's actually... That might be not a bad idea.
[94:39.39]He's doing more experimentation there.
[94:44.67]That guy didn't turn into like a thousand pieces.
[94:46.88]Holy shit.
[94:49.44]That was a bobsleigh that came out of nowhere.
[94:59.55]Scattergun.
[95:00.23]Is there only three weapons in this game?
[95:07.21]It's not like a big deal.
[95:08.23]I wish there was better... If you have a game about time manipulation, you'd think that you'd want to add more things to do.
[95:17.62]What's the point of this?
[95:21.12]No idea.
[95:23.98]Is this some dumb gimmick?
[95:29.15]It has to be a dumb gimmick, right?
[95:38.74]Rewind time?
[95:39.56]I have no idea.
[95:46.48]Go up.
[95:58.22]This whole game is a dumb gimmick.
[96:00.88]Just go play Wall-E.
[96:01.94]I mean, I'd have to go this way, but how do I move this shit?
[96:33.42]What the fuck?
[96:40.31]Oh, okay.
[96:40.77]There's a hole.
[96:45.67]Ah, I got you.
[96:46.13]I got you.
[96:46.61]Let's go.
[96:48.17]Go ahead and rewind that, please.
[96:54.00]Alright.
[96:55.28]Admit the WALL-E game is better?
[96:56.66]No.
[96:57.48]No, I will fight you guys Until Dawn.
[97:05.39]Turn what on?
[97:05.87]Am I in the bathroom?
[97:14.08]Well, there we go.
[97:22.92]Turn him on.
[97:27.46]Wait!
[97:27.72]Do you see what I'm talking about?
[97:29.49]Oh, there's a door.
[97:30.07]Okay.
[97:30.27]There's a door there.
[97:39.70]I was just going to use that as an excuse.
[97:49.14]That's it, right?
[97:50.96]That's where I came in.
[97:51.78]This door is now open.
[97:55.30]And let's... Oh, God.
[97:57.22]Okay.
[97:57.60]This...
[98:01.25]Somebody tell me... Hands on your head.
[98:04.11]Alright, should I freeze time here?
[98:05.13]No, bad spot.
[98:12.88]Okay, we're good.
[98:17.08]I can't see anything though.
[98:19.00]This guy down here is just watching me do this.
[98:27.48]He's just like, wow, that's really neat!
[98:30.73]You're really good at that.
[98:40.43]This isn't even hard enough to need the freeze gimmick.
[98:42.97]Yes, it is.
[98:45.23]Is it?
[98:47.42]You know, maybe you're right.
[98:48.92]This isn't.
[98:49.48]This is not hard.
[98:51.62]Wait a minute.
[98:58.53]This is really not.
[99:02.53]This is not even... You don't even need to slow down time.
[99:05.15]That was fucking brutal.
[99:19.43]My death... Why are we having a death counter in time shift, guys?
[99:25.30]Are you trying to, like, embarrass me that I died, like, 19 times in Timeshift?
[99:28.92]19-timeshift?
[99:30.84]Press this button.
[99:35.01]What?
[99:35.27]I need to fucking know.
[99:37.09]I have to know.
[99:49.81]Okay, so he sprinted from all the way down the hall.
[99:54.72]I needed to know where he came from.
[99:56.02]I wish it would go back further, because I don't think he existed before.
[99:59.56]He would have spawned in.
[100:00.24]Alright, we can go in here.
[100:06.64]Oh, it's one of these dumb things.
[100:26.43]Fucking gimmick.
[100:37.50]There we go.
[100:39.32]No, that's... I got it.
[100:41.22]We're good.
[100:42.48]Alright, I'm in the jail now.
[100:45.30]I gotta, like, release some prisoners or something.
[100:50.63]This guy's banging.
[100:52.35]Shut up, you're okay with your skull?
[101:01.44]Guys we're gonna have to come on.
[101:05.21]This is this a joke here No, it's not never mind
[101:23.61]Come on.
[101:24.11]Get me underneath this.
[101:25.65]Oh, you dick game.
[101:28.22]I'm just... Go this way.
[101:30.08]I get it.
[101:30.56]Funny.
[101:30.90]Fucking cool.
[101:34.42]I'm standing up now, I think, in the vent.
[101:41.71]Security!
[101:57.43]Slide the panel.
[102:06.42]Didn't get it done fast enough, did you?
[102:08.98]Maybe they did.
[102:09.48]Is that way they can hear the alert?
[102:12.10]How do I turn the alert off?
[102:13.00]Like I said, there actually is an alarm system in the game.
[102:17.28]Did not know.
[102:19.12]Let's open up some of these cells.
[102:25.55]I'm looking for a particular guy, right?
[102:29.24]That one don't open.
[102:35.29]Can't open this one?
[102:39.09]What's the point of it?
[102:39.87]Slide.
[102:40.27]Come on.
[102:45.03]Is that you?
[102:45.50]It's not you.
[102:54.48]Alright.
[102:54.90]It ain't you.
[102:56.60]Not the right guy I'm looking for apparently.
[103:00.80]Here he comes.
[103:01.32]Get predicted.
[103:08.23]What?
[103:12.87]Am I going back in the vent?
[103:27.98]Everything's out of service.
[103:30.04]Ooh, a new gun?
[103:32.09]Come on, give me a new gun.
[103:32.93]Ammo, fuck sake.
[103:45.37]There's gotta be like a button to press, but apparently there's not.
[103:47.93]There's the electric chair, damn, okay.
[103:56.25]That's not a button to press.
[103:58.34]Take out the cameras, make sure they don't see you.
[104:02.51]I think, I guess I did it.
[104:04.29]Suspect, contact!
[104:31.12]Was it shooting?
[104:31.58]It was shooting through the window.
[104:36.02]Wait, what's going on?
[104:37.28]What happened to the stream?
[104:44.57]I can't shoot through that glass, but they can.
[104:47.55]Alright.
[104:49.15]We learned something.
[104:52.15]We learned that I can't shoot through the glass, but the glass can shoot through me.
[104:58.05]Okay, well, we're just gonna do this then.
[105:05.69]Goodbye What the fuck is that what that's that that's it that's the thing that's the thing That little slit in the fucking wall is the machine is the minigun What it's these things Little coin slots in the wall
[105:39.74]Well, now we wait.
[105:49.19]I don't know... Could I have gone through there, or do I have to go, like, and vent?
[106:00.16]Okay, we're gonna vent it out.
[106:03.60]Get in there.
[106:07.78]Let's see your papers.
[106:10.94]That's not something you ask in the start.
[106:12.92]Oh, fuck this guy.
[106:13.90]Hey, guy in the window.
[106:22.00]Let's see your papers.
[106:25.42]Security off.
[106:26.42]Security system deactivated.
[106:30.63]Oh, you guys.
[106:31.33]Hey, look, no more.
[106:37.92]How far into the game do you think we are?
[106:40.42]Do you think we're almost done?
[106:48.16]See?
[106:49.28]Thank you Harmony Accord for the $4.
[106:50.34]Another batch of horse pudding smells fresh, thank you.
[106:54.87]Well, thank you.
[106:56.57]Do I have control of the mouse?
[107:03.31]Tutorial Island.
[107:06.31]This game is nine hours?
[107:07.89]Are you shitting me?
[107:16.16]I don't hate this game.
[107:17.34]I don't know why everyone hates this.
[107:19.90]It's just kind of fun to chill and be Mr. Time Man.
[107:24.40]Oh, it's one of those vacuums!
[107:25.36]One of those robo-cleaners!
[107:28.68]What a cute little thing.
[107:32.62]Wow, this really is the future.
[107:38.20]What are those things called?
[107:38.94]Robovax?
[107:39.48]What are they?
[107:39.80]What are they?
[107:45.27]Fucking thing sucks.
[107:47.43]You ever have one of those things?
[107:49.53]Newsflash.
[107:51.17]They don't work.
[107:51.91]They run into walls.
[107:56.89]They run... They do... I'm trying to fucking talk.
[108:08.43]It's suplexed.
[108:10.85]Jesus.
[108:17.54]A Roomba!
[108:18.04]That's what it is, a Roomba.
[108:20.28]They're terrible.
[108:20.84]They don't do anything.
[108:27.52]No, not this shit.
[108:29.26]Alright, we're getting real close for me to get like two of them.
[108:32.26]No, we're not.
[108:32.78]I'm gonna play it.
[108:41.69]Okay.
[108:44.71]Well, there's one way to do it.
[108:55.64]I guess I go in this door.
[108:57.12]The door that I just came in.
[109:07.33]Right?
[109:07.57]Head into the test chamber.
[109:12.79]I guess I'm just going home now.
[109:14.55]I'll see you later.
[109:15.23]That was fun while it lasted.
[109:18.29]Let's go to the exit.
[109:27.66]Uh... Staff only.
[109:37.27]Stain?
[109:41.84]Has anybody dropped like a fucking milk on the ground?
[109:46.58]Just want to let you guys know there's a stain down here.
[109:48.66]I don't think I'm going the right way.
[109:57.13]Can't go down there yet.
[110:04.51]Well.
[110:08.76]Oh, shit.
[110:09.66]I think I...
[110:12.25]I think I did something wrong here.
[110:17.05]Did I do something wrong?
[110:17.81]I didn't check down.
[110:20.16]No.
[110:20.42]What the fuck am I supposed to do?
[110:23.18]God damn it.
[110:23.64]I think I did something wrong.
[110:26.16]I definitely did something wrong.
[110:32.70]You would think I could go out here, but I can't.
[110:35.67]I think I was supposed to rewind.
[110:42.90]I can't go anywhere, though.
[110:44.12]I have to go this way.
[110:50.54]Ladder?
[110:52.99]Am I stuck here?
[110:59.81]All these doors are barred.
[111:01.03]This is the only one I can go in.
[111:07.46]Okay, well, I guess we're going to try to go back.
[111:14.13]Time to open up a walkthrough.
[111:15.45]No, I don't think I'm in desperate need.
[111:18.37]That desperate, not yet.
[111:19.33]Holy shit.
[111:22.17]Okay, you're all here.
[111:23.09]I think I have to rewind time.
[111:31.52]Here.
[111:35.12]Rewind.
[111:38.08]Oh, that happened a very long time ago.
[111:39.84]I think I have to die.
[111:42.94]Yeah, I gotta die here.
[111:43.96]Because I gotta ride those.
[111:45.94]Yeah, kill me.
[111:48.74]Kill me.
[111:50.10]Kill me.
[111:50.44]Okay.
[111:54.75]I gotta ride those back up.
[111:56.95]With a rewind.
[112:11.84]Or maybe I don't.
[112:16.50]Um, what?
[112:20.43]Back up and ride.
[112:23.17]Okay, so apparently that's not what I had to do.
[112:34.49]You're almost sure I'm going to die.
[112:38.11]Let me close.
[112:44.44]This door, have I gone in here?
[112:46.78]Guess not.
[112:47.34]Okay.
[112:49.46]Somebody told me I had to, like, ride the fucking bricks back up.
[112:55.50]There's like a rewind feature in the game.
[112:58.40]You'd think that they would make you do something like that.
[113:02.54]Jesus.
[113:15.89]No, it's not worth rewinding.
[113:17.01]It's not worth rewinding.
[113:18.01]Don't remind that.
[113:18.91]Save it.
[113:20.41]You fucking idiot.
[113:23.09]Open it up.
[113:23.57]Let's go.
[113:39.80]I don't know what's happening.
[113:40.74]All I see is electricity.
[113:46.63]These guys have different guns?
[113:47.75]Oh, come on.
[113:52.33]Guys, I'm not even fucking sure what's happening.
[113:54.81]I'm so dead.
[114:01.67]If I don't finish this game on stream, then you lose your gamer license.
[114:05.61]Please have somebody stick...
[114:09.44]clay in my eyes, because that's what just happened.
[114:11.40]Oh my fucking god.
[114:13.80]Give me a fucking break, game.
[114:18.61]Ugh.
[114:22.47]Give me a fucking break!
[114:26.30]Alright, now I'm a little irritated.
[114:27.60]Just a little.
[114:41.47]I just opened the door.
[114:43.09]God damn it.
[114:45.29]I don't want to fucking... What are you doing in the doorway?
[114:52.54]What are you doing in the doorway?
[114:53.70]Dude, like, please.
[114:55.78]That's gonna kill me.
[115:01.26]Anybody in here?
[115:02.16]Come on.
[115:09.51]I'm getting, like, pre-fired.
[115:15.46]That was a very smart AI.
[115:26.97]These dudes gotta die.
[115:29.15]Like, before anything, these guys up here.
[115:30.93]Guys with 500,000 HP.
[115:42.18]Look at this mess.
[115:53.83]Is he still alive?
[115:58.03]He's up top.
[116:02.61]There he is.
[116:03.53]Reload the gun.
[116:04.25]I can't even see him.
[116:11.22]That guy's just a muzzle flash.
[116:12.62]He's not even a character anymore.
[116:18.53]There.
[116:18.97]You're not going to live through this.
[116:29.18]What?
[116:31.32]Why?
[116:32.10]God.
[116:33.52]They just came out of nowhere.
[116:35.16]I don't know.
[116:36.89]I don't know, right?
[116:37.69]I don't know.
[116:43.14]Clip in the face, I know, really.
[117:00.15]Guys, he doesn't know.
[117:01.01]He doesn't know, guys.
[117:02.03]He doesn't fucking know.
[117:09.33]Two more, one more.
[117:16.11]You do have to admit, though, it is kind of funny that I have Deadeye again for the second time in a row.
[117:20.74]Second game in a row.
[117:22.32]Alright, here we go.
[117:23.69]Turn this off.
[117:26.26]Contacting security And then there's like five people in here already immediately they just spawned Give me that thing fuck out of here
[117:56.36]That actually startled the fuck out of me.
[117:58.21]It did.
[117:58.41]I'm not gonna lie.
[118:28.54]I guess up here, and through this, and around the bend.
[118:32.14]Okay, that sounds easy enough.
[118:34.64]I saved that, but I'm gonna get spawned on.
[118:37.75]And you all know it.
[118:46.93]Come on!
[118:49.99]Come on, really, no!
[118:53.74]Do I just have to leave?
[118:55.60]Climb through the fucking cords.
[119:03.27]This is just confusing.
[119:04.43]I don't like this.
[119:06.27]One of these is going to turn into a snake or something.
[119:09.62]Game's dumb enough already as it is.
[119:21.73]Come on.
[119:22.75]You know exactly what I'm talking about.
[119:24.23]I don't even know where to go.
[119:25.17]I guess this way.
[119:30.95]Everybody that's ever had a gun in the world is shooting at me right now.
[119:33.61]Look at how many people are there.
[119:45.59]Can I just take a second and look?
[119:51.91]Do they all go down?
[119:54.55]What the fuck?
[119:59.63]How are they... What in the name of God?
[120:03.43]They're all up here.
[120:09.78]How did they get up here?
[120:19.56]Is this stairs that they're going up?
[120:23.16]Must be.
[120:23.50]I have no idea.
[120:24.30]I don't know how many... Luigi!
[120:35.88]Well, that was a flash reaction.
[120:41.86]Luigi.
[120:48.11]Where's Luigi?
[120:49.93]Is that what I said?
[120:51.05]Well... I don't like how many enemies are in this game, even though you get superpowers.
[120:59.61]Eyes open, men.
[121:00.31]They're gonna open this door.
[121:14.78]Get the regular gun.
[121:20.20]What is so important that's in this room?
[121:28.74]Luigi's somewhat haunted mansion.
[121:30.50]I think that's everybody.
[121:36.63]See, I told you.
[121:38.45]Look at this guy's fucking setup.
[121:40.43]He's got a monitor for the game, monitor for chat, monitor for, like, just, like, stream health, and then, like,
[121:52.58]An extra one on a black screen.
[121:55.08]That's a nice gaming... Every time.
[121:57.28]It gets me every time.
[122:01.64]How do I kill this thing?
[122:21.98]To put a cat- You know what?
[122:28.14]Die you- What the fuck?!
[122:30.64]This thing has a flame thrower?!
[122:33.53]Okay, now you just became cool.
[122:36.19]You- Now you became cool.
[122:37.47]Good job.
[122:47.81]Evasive action required.
[122:49.19]Well, that means I have to pause the game.
[122:50.91]Perfect fucking timing.
[122:52.79]Look at that.
[122:54.33]Hey, I don't know.
[122:54.97]Have you seen that guy?
[122:56.31]Where's that guy that usually... Oh, you're not supposed to be in here.
[123:02.59]Game sucks.
[123:17.97]What?
[123:21.01]Oh, there's another elevator.
[123:22.13]Okay.
[123:24.95]Why does the janitor have a gun?
[123:26.63]I don't know.
[123:30.23]Evasive action on this one, too?
[123:33.97]Is the gunplay bad?
[123:34.77]No, this game's not bad.
[123:36.79]It's not a fucking bad game.
[123:39.47]Everybody thinks this game is bad.

[125:47.41]But it was like pushing things down.
[125:48.72]Whatever.

[138:50.77]Don't shoot from that far away with a shotgun, you dumbass.
[138:58.84]I go real close and shoot with a sniper rifle, and I just was talking shit.
[139:04.74]Really?
[139:05.08]How dare I?
[139:07.92]We both were using our weapons in the absolute worst possible imaginable way.
[139:14.42]No, I want the rifle.
[139:15.16]Wait, what am I doing?
[139:23.42]Wait, am I gonna go up?
[139:29.90]No, elevator.
[139:35.98]Elevator?
[139:39.82]Get in the elevator, please.
[139:41.59]Other side?
[139:43.89]How do I get this to work?
[139:49.05]The game break on me.
[139:49.81]Uh, where's the pistol?
[139:56.80]Get rid of the pistol.
[140:01.36]Okay, yeah.
[140:01.87]I can get rid of the dumb pistol.
[140:09.89]Let me in here.
[140:13.45]Don't do this.
[140:15.05]No.
[140:17.24]Oh.
[140:19.52]Whoops.
[140:20.10]The level, you dangus.
[140:21.54]What happened to the end is nigh?
[140:24.12]We're gonna start that on Tuesday.
[140:38.02]Tomorrow we're doing the Just Cause 3 multiplayer mod.
[140:42.62]That's going to be... What the fuck just happened?
[140:52.49]Was that the story right there?
[140:53.33]Okay.
[141:08.70]Remember, you guys know the rule.
[141:09.86]That's the dumbest fucking steering wheel.
[141:12.58]That is the stupidest steering wheel I've ever seen.
[141:14.64]It's a pirate ship wheel.
[141:36.96]With a green swirly on it.
[141:38.22]Everybody on this ship is dying.
[141:40.62]Why can I not move?
[141:41.49]Shouldn't I be able to move around?
[141:58.88]Thank you, runs without scissors.
[141:59.68]That was very loud.
[142:28.71]Moo means moo.
[142:29.31]Thanks for the $5.
[142:30.41]I'm now on this.
[142:33.49]We're just dumping around like crazy.
[142:42.38]I don't want to play this mission, but I'm going to.
[142:44.24]Okay, how about this one?
[142:46.98]We're not going to use the abilities one time.
[142:49.92]We're just going to do a complete beachhead with this.
[142:52.92]I'm not going to use any abilities.
[142:55.48]I don't get it.
[143:10.77]Don't, I'm not using like rewind, slow down.
[143:12.95]I'm not sure I can get those ones though.
[143:17.92]Attention.
[143:19.04]Port.
[143:20.40]Attention.
[143:21.58]Starboard side engine failure.
[143:24.98]Airframe integrity 80%.
[143:26.14]Two destroyers incoming. 70%.
[143:44.18]Don't fail.
[143:44.70]I don't want to watch this mission again.
[143:46.00]Good fucking point.
[143:47.20]That's a really good point.
[143:48.38]I'm not going to mess around.
[143:53.62]That's a good point.
[143:54.32]Yeah, that's right.
[143:55.28]We're not messing this one around.
[143:58.20]I am messing this one up.
[144:10.47]I already wasted a bunch of fucking time messing around.
[144:22.25]God, Jesus Christ.
[144:25.71]What?
[144:42.44]Okay.
[144:45.04]That was... There was a lot going on there.
[144:47.58]And the guy that just said... It's alright.
[144:50.12]We're good, we're good, we're good.
[144:51.00]I just gotta...
[145:04.91]Gonna beat it this time.
[145:15.54]There's too many.
[145:17.32]And I don't get enough power.
[145:18.50]There's like 30 of these.
[145:21.04]I'm gonna lose.
[145:22.28]Rewind.
[145:24.94]Okay, that's how you get... I can get health back by rewinding.
[145:26.80]Airplane integrity 50%.
[145:43.78]Come on, get four of them at the same time.
[145:45.04]Come on.
[145:46.44]Alright, good.
[145:54.54]It's actually regenning.
[145:55.70]Okay.
[145:56.24]Now the rewind doesn't do anything, apparently.
[145:57.69]Oh my god!
[146:08.19]Don't do it.
[146:09.01]Don't.
[146:12.49]Holy shit in my underwear, man.
[146:14.29]Give me a break.
[146:25.40]What is this doing?
[146:27.22]Wait, go back.
[146:28.82]I missed what they were saying.
[146:31.85]Okay, I gotta kill this thing, like, right now.
[146:41.45]Go back, go back, go back.
[146:52.06]This is the hardest mission I've ever done in a video game.
[147:01.43]We good?
[147:20.66]That's double kill, right?
[147:21.70]Come on, give it to me.
[147:29.71]Can I get rid of those?
[147:31.29]Okay, I can.
[147:33.87]I guess I think I can.
[147:34.71]I don't know.
[147:43.45]How much is left here?
[147:52.94]I really don't want to do this mission again.
[147:54.58]This is painful.
[147:59.10]I'm getting like thumb... I'm getting thumb anxiety.
[148:01.54]Alright, I'm good.
[148:04.02]Safe.
[148:08.44]My hand hurts.
[148:10.02]Is there a boss here?
[148:23.81]Oh, my fucking hand.
[148:25.63]My pinky and shit.
[148:26.55]It's killing me.
[148:31.28]Can I get out of this ship?
[148:46.48]Don't do it.
[148:47.12]What's happening?
[148:48.50]Okay, the title of the video just said it like four more times.
[148:52.83]What's happening?
[148:54.53]What?
[148:54.85]What happened?
[148:57.17]What's happening?
[148:58.67]We're good.
[149:15.80]Too easy.
[149:18.40]Anyway, stay purple and never trust purple.
[149:21.52]Thanks for 10 bucks.
[149:22.58]Spotter confirms hit dead on.
[149:24.04]Qualification... Spotter confirms dead on.
[149:26.92]What are you doing?
[149:28.07]Thanks for the 10 bucks.
[149:28.95]And a beep.
[149:29.25]Thanks, beep, for the bits.
[149:30.23]And snake Z for the bits.
[149:46.59]Evening, Jerma, love your streams.
[149:48.23]A bit tight on money, but still want to give some because your streams are great to catch after a long day and you deserve it.
[149:53.90]May I recommend the Magic Circle?
[149:59.38]Fun story-driven game where you can screw around with enemies' abilities and make them your weapon.
[150:04.57]I honestly think it's a game you would like.
[150:06.97]Magic Circle.
[150:12.61]There he is.
[150:13.85]There's the guy that was the captain of that ship.
[150:15.86]Dead.
[150:19.26]I don't have any... Okay, well, I walked out there for no reason.
[150:21.55]I thought I had grenades.
[150:25.01]I thought I had anything.
[150:25.65]We're dead.
[150:30.98]Okay.
[150:33.62]I don't have any rockets.
[150:35.18]No, I mean, grenades.
[150:36.04]Nothing.
[150:36.42]I thought I had them loaded in, but apparently not.
[150:40.41]Magic Circle is actually really good.
[150:41.91]You would love it.
[150:42.45]I'm going to have to check it out, then.
[150:46.59]I think Jeremy's playing this game to spite... We're not doing a death counter.
[150:52.00]There's no death counter.
[151:00.60]Oh, fucking four-wheelers.
[151:06.07]Can I get on it?
[151:07.53]Please tell me I can get on the car.
[151:18.39]It's on the fucking harder difficulty.
[151:25.14]Just kill it.
[151:27.62]Jesus.
[151:28.24]Fuck.
[151:31.72]I got too excited that I could drive one of those stupid ATVs and I walked out and died.
[151:35.37]Okay.
[151:40.87]Just get it done.
[151:41.49]This is the stupid fucking tank thing.
[151:44.98]Like, I'm not a tank.
[151:45.94]We've seen a hundred of these yet.
[151:47.40]No, stop the complaining.
[151:48.44]This game came out like in 2003.
[151:49.38]That's not how cars work, by the way.
[152:07.94]And it has to reload.
[152:08.88]Fucking come on.
[152:09.72]It has to reload.
[152:24.22]Same guy.
[152:24.92]I don't think I have any bullets left.
[152:32.34]No, I do.
[152:32.60]I have two bullets left.
[152:42.68]What the fuck is that?
[152:45.04]Oh.
[152:45.58]Hitting left bumper and Y. And not left trigger to zoom out like... Oh my lord.
[152:53.26]Shut up.
[152:53.74]Stop it.
[152:54.18]This game came out... What are you thinking?
[152:59.55]Game fucking came out in 2001.
[153:02.09]Stop it.
[153:08.45]He's not even holding a gun.
[153:18.74]This game is like a demo of all the stock sound effects I used at the stop-motion movies I made.
[153:27.63]Okay, I... This game... I know exactly what you're fucking talking about, by the way.
[153:33.42]That's so funny to me.
[153:37.29]This is just all the stock sound effects from all the little, like, 3D, like, movies you made when you were, like, fucking 11.
[153:45.45]It's true.
[153:50.02]Don't die from that.
[153:51.08]It's funny.
[153:51.86]Why?
[153:52.66]No!
[153:52.88]Oh, yes.
[154:02.77]Yes.
[154:05.39]Oh no.
[154:07.99]Yes.
[154:09.82]The game just got so much more fun.
[154:12.46]Does it slow-mo my driving?
[154:14.80]Nope, it doesn't.
[154:18.44]What happens if I rewind?
[154:22.34]Okay, yes.
[154:23.40]Quad boost.
[154:28.15]It rewinds my car.
[154:29.73]We need to test it.
[154:31.19]We need to do like an O'Doyle rules.
[154:36.16]Rewind.
[154:38.62]That shit never happened.
[154:40.04]Oh, hold on.
[154:56.61]Wait, I have
[155:07.46]I have to do the mission again, don't I?
[155:13.08]I just put my hand, like I just, I just facepalmed in real fucking life.
[155:23.19]Look at how fast this guy's going.
[155:24.39]Watch this.
[155:27.97]See?
[155:28.25]That's not how cars function.
[155:32.81]Zoom out!
[155:36.93]I'm gonna die again.
[155:37.71]And we're gonna die again.
[155:38.89]We're gonna die again because, like... This, like, left trigger, left bumper, why?
[155:43.59]Oh, stop it.
[155:45.27]Stop it.
[155:50.17]I'm just... God damn it, man.
[155:52.34]Like, I was just testing fate.
[155:55.12]For real.
[155:59.00]Here they come.
[156:24.06]Like, honestly, I was trying to do something there.
[156:26.12]Like, if I could explain what I was trying to do.
[156:29.41]Like, I... I was trying to... I'm not even going to try to explain.
[156:34.51]Like, let's just fucking beat this stupid fucking mission before I have a meltdown on stream.
[156:49.09]Okay, let's do the boring shit part of this game.
[156:53.26]And hold left bumper and press Y and then hold left trigger.
[156:59.14]What?
[156:59.68]Where the fuck did you do?
[157:01.02]I'm so angry right now.
[157:02.50]And that guy's not... I'm hiding back here.
[157:08.89]These controls want to make me throw up and then drink the throw up and then piss it out and drink that too.
[157:12.43]I'm not even kidding.
[157:20.71]I'm just gonna sit here.
[157:21.69]This is fucking stupid.
[157:29.73]Give me the ammo, please.
[157:44.18]Thought I was having fun.
[157:46.54]Oh, shit.
[157:47.06]I was having fun.
[157:47.84]What do I do?
[158:02.16]What an idiot.
[158:05.16]Did he not die from that?
[158:06.12]He didn't die from his own grenade?
[158:14.50]I'm raging after driving my tricycle.
[158:16.32]Yeah, this call could have been avoided.
[158:19.64]Get back on that ATV and make jokes before I unsubscribe.
[158:24.43]Come on, give me a break.
[158:25.37]I'm trying to do my best I can.
[158:37.90]He's not dead.
[158:39.86]And I still reload.
[158:47.72]Doing the best I can.
[158:48.76]Is the guy on one of those ATVs right now?
[158:52.58]I think he is.
[159:01.16]Holy sh...
[159:05.95]That was such a perfect grenade, dogs.
[159:09.62]I'm actually upset about his grenade skills.
[159:11.70]Okay, they're all dead.
[159:14.90]No fucking around.
[159:17.90]Easy.
[159:19.40]Just get the ammo, get what you need, get on an ATV, and you've made your dumb... Look at me, look at me, oh, look at me.
[159:27.57]You made that, you did that already.
[159:28.73]Don't do that again.
[159:30.47]Save the game right here.
[159:34.18]Make sure you say, you know, look at me, look what I, look at me.
[159:38.94]We already did it.
[159:39.46]Don't need to do it again.
[159:40.17]Let's go.
[159:51.74]Quad boost.
[159:56.28]A good starting point should be Deltabats down in Zeppelin.
[159:59.48]Based on your intel, the Magistrate fortified it and is using it as a base.
[160:06.96]That sounded like I shot it up the fucking cliff.
[160:12.27]That's disappointing, I wish.
[160:15.41]It made legit whoosh noise.
[160:21.71]Thought it was gone.
[160:30.75]Almost killed me.
[160:35.96]What is it?
[160:36.50]What happened?
[160:44.87]Break!
[160:45.31]Hit the breaks!
[160:45.85]Alright.
[160:50.81]I'm gonna have to rewind while it's going down.
[160:56.07]Here we go.
[160:58.99]And... Punch it!
[161:00.85]Rewind.
[161:03.26]No, not... Wait, what?
[161:07.40]I gotta pause it.
[161:08.22]I gotta pause it.
[161:09.20]Pause it.
[161:11.64]Pause it.
[161:12.06]Pause it.
[161:12.43]Pause it.
[161:12.79]Pause it.
[161:13.09]I get you.
[161:13.47]Here we go.
[161:17.45]Done deal.
[161:35.28]No, no, it's not worth it.
[161:36.86]It's not worth it.
[161:37.49]It's not worth it.
[161:38.79]The joke is not worth it.
[161:40.03]Maybe it was.
[161:40.81]Was it worth it?
[161:41.35]I hope it was worth it.
[161:51.22]Oh shit, I can ghost ride it.
[161:58.39]I'm so glad there are cars in this game.
[162:01.87]The game, look, listen.
[162:04.23]If somebody is making a game right now, if you're developing a video game, if you're, you know, not sure what to do next, I don't care if it's like a fucking Zelda game.
[162:11.83]I don't care if there are cartoon characters.
[162:13.69]I don't care if it's a fucking card game.
[162:16.99]Don't care.
[162:19.00]Put a car in the game and you made the game fucking an extra letter grade more fun.
[162:25.26]For real.
[162:33.93]What the fuck?
[162:35.07]Let me have my fun.
[162:44.13]I'm just fucking laughing about it a little bit quickly.
[162:46.21]We're fine.
[163:00.27]Mortal Kombat, add a car.
[163:06.05]I got my own rewind.
[163:17.89]Move.
[163:22.21]I love the speed boost.
[163:23.27]They had to add a speed boost.
[163:24.47]Of course they did.
[163:33.16]Alright, don't fuck it up.
[163:34.40]I know you really want to.
[163:44.75]It's back.
[163:46.35]The fucking party- the meme horn is back.
[163:50.79]There's no reason for that.
[163:53.40]Where did it come from?
[163:54.72]It was in the beginning of the game.
[163:55.86]Why is it here again?
[163:57.96]Who is the fucking clown?
[164:01.94]I don't know.
[164:02.54]I don't know who the fucking clown is.
[164:06.82]But it's funny.
[164:09.66]It's SportsCenter.
[164:12.71]Fucking SportsCenter.
[164:15.74]Around the horn, man.
[164:17.82]That was just a worker.
[164:18.84]I just killed a worker.
[164:19.92]I can't... I fucking can't even... I have no composure right now.
[164:37.91]Sports center.
[164:40.35]What do you mean explosive material?
[164:46.40]Where's there an explosive material?
[164:47.70]What is this?
[164:49.34]I think I have to go pick up some explosives.
[165:02.85]Wait, I tried to hit... What?
[165:04.37]This guy's blocking me.
[165:05.27]Holy shit.
[165:10.96]Shit.
[165:24.88]Got one.
[165:25.42]This game is so much more fun with this.
[165:51.28]Come on.
[165:56.94]I broke my glasses!
[165:58.24]Alright, not again.
[166:07.74]Make our way through this very gently.
[166:11.10]Watch out for the fucking random, like, iron workers.
[166:15.54]They have guns.
[166:17.48]Why are you just throwing grenade?
[166:22.81]I can't, I can't, I can't.
[166:27.45]Fucking machine guns.
[166:31.12]Like a grenade just goes by the screen.
[166:35.08]Why?
[166:35.44]Oh, this game is great.
[166:38.24]Come on.
[166:38.86]Everybody wanted me to stop playing this.
[166:40.36]This game is fucking great.
[166:42.94]This game is... Oh, shit.
[166:49.81]Get on it.
[166:58.05]Alright, and we made it out.
[167:01.13]We made it out alive.
[167:04.49]These train tracks are kind of uneven, though.
[167:08.60]Took its sweet time to get good.
[167:12.44]I told you, we just had to get out of the tutorial.
[167:15.50]All it took was to get out of the tutorial and get a fucking speed bike, and we can, like... And, ladies and gentlemen, that's how you fucking do... That's how you do a backflip.
[167:26.04]I better see at least four or five PogChamps in that chat.
[167:28.84]I better see them.
[167:29.70]Because that was fucking incredible.
[167:31.29]Didn't even fall off the bike.
[167:33.97]Wait, get off.
[167:34.47]Get off the bike.
[167:35.17]Get off the bike.
[167:40.19]I gotta actually be careful here.
[167:44.16]Just look at how many enemies there are here.
[167:45.76]This is outrageous.
[167:49.22]What an outrageous fucking game.
[167:54.58]I can't even shoot that far.
[167:59.82]I'm assuming that was a grenade that somebody just threw at me, right?
[168:03.00]Holy shit.
[168:14.00]I gotta sneak up to this.
[168:16.82]I have to, like... I can't... I gotta, like, sneak up to that shit.
[168:20.55]There are, like, 75 enemies here.
[168:26.95]I'm not going up that stupid...
[168:30.79]Jesus.
[168:37.69]Nice.
[168:40.33]Rewind time!
[168:41.11]That means they all come back to life!
[168:46.24]No, I just gotta, like, hide.
[168:47.92]And not go up the wall.
[168:49.82]I keep going up the wall, and I shouldn't be doing that.
[168:59.85]Like for instance, here we go.
[169:02.37]I need to go this way.
[169:19.25]Well, if I had any more bullets in this garden, it might have been a good thing.
[169:33.78]Is this even a fucking possible thing to do?
[169:41.34]What?
[169:41.84]What?
[169:42.10]Is this a completable mission?
[169:57.09]Yes, I am still having fun.
[170:03.38]you've run into like dirt come on alright we gotta I gotta get like ammo here these guys have rockets man they have grenades just like me it's not fair
[170:27.04]I need to sincerely take a look at my surroundings here.
[170:29.40]That guy just did like a whale impression.
[170:34.58]Carbine ammo.
[170:36.72]What did you have?
[170:38.86]I can't lose my trusty bike though.
[170:45.50]How am I supposed to actually do this?
[170:52.16]Let me save it right here.
[170:58.92]It's not fair.
[170:59.68]It's not fair.
[171:00.50]Well, I think this part up here is not fair at all.
[171:06.94]This shit is kind of ridiculous.
[171:17.33]When in doubt.
[171:18.65]I got it.
[171:18.99]Figured it out, boys and girls.
[171:23.23]It's not a... It's not an explosive barrel.
[171:27.44]It's one of the pretend explosive barrels.
[171:29.77]But this don't even need an explosive barrel.
[171:32.43]He's got two explosive barrels on his back.
[171:43.32]Get it.
[171:44.20]Get it.
[171:56.17]I shot it.
[171:56.76]I shot the thing right in the explosion.
[171:59.76]Freeze time and snipe them.
[172:00.66]I don't have any ammo in the sniper rifle.
[172:02.16]I have zero shots in the sniper rifle.
[172:04.32]I don't think I can complete this mission.
[172:05.74]I'm gonna hide behind the fucking little tiny tree here.
[172:19.43]And, like, they have fucking bombs!
[172:26.38]What is the scenario here where I can play this out and win?
[172:34.27]I'm gonna just train them around the corner.
[172:38.07]They're like in the air.
[172:39.75]I guess maybe I... I'm just gonna drive in.
[172:41.51]There's a guy up there.
[173:00.65]I mean, we lost our ATV.
[173:04.93]But I might be able to pick all these guys off that are in the air and the jetpacks.
[173:07.41]Because there's nobody in the camp now.
[173:13.25]What do we got?
[173:13.73]Who's there?
[173:16.17]Can I get this guy from back here?
[173:26.29]I think I got him.
[173:28.22]Yep, definitely got that guy.
[173:35.18]There's no way anybody is that good of a shot from that far away.
[173:39.95]Except for me.
[173:53.20]There's a couple guys here.
[173:55.88]Shooting rockets.
[173:58.38]Yeah, why are you alive?
[174:02.53]Okay, I definitely have to... I'm doing this wrong.
[174:12.40]I'm certain of that now.
[174:15.10]I have to just drive into the camp and pause it.
[174:18.00]Without a doubt.
[174:19.36]So we're going to try to just get it.
[174:23.48]There's no way I'm gonna get it.
[174:24.84]But I can at least pretend I'm gonna get it, right?
[174:31.06]Alright, we pretended to get it.
[174:35.78]Was it enough for me to pretend to get it?
[174:37.32]It's in this stupid fucking tent.
[174:43.37]Okay.
[174:43.63]Of course it is.
[174:44.81]Of course I walked all the way around.
[174:49.31]Where is the explosive?
[174:50.97]Where the fuck is the explosive?
[174:52.25]I can't go in the tent.
[174:55.67]Is it like a barrel?
[174:56.64]Like, I don't... What is happening right now?
[175:06.22]What is this?
[175:06.86]Explosions over and over again.
[175:08.98]You dick, it's over.
[175:09.83]I'm gonna die.
[175:10.27]It's an explosion.
[175:15.57]What?
[175:19.97]What?
[175:26.16]Did you guys see how many times a bomb exploded on me?
[175:28.70]That was like five times in a row.
[175:30.10]Alright, fuck it.
[175:32.30]I don't even care.
[175:34.26]I'm just driving straight into the camp.
[175:39.06]This was so fun.
[175:40.16]Why did they ruin it?
[175:41.92]You guys fucking ruined this game.
[175:50.49]Okay.
[175:52.09]You maneuvered your explosive materials nearby in this camp, I think.
[176:04.06]I tried to open that door, but it didn't work.
[176:08.22]Holy shit, guys.
[176:14.70]Jesus Christ.
[176:19.02]This is fucking stupid.
[176:22.52]Use the turret?
[176:23.46]That's not possible.
[176:30.88]There's 40 people here.
[176:36.68]I have to get in the tent.
[176:38.76]And out.
[176:39.88]By the ti- I gotta like drive this into the tent.
[176:46.79]That fucking stalk sound.
[176:48.75]Go!
[176:49.13]Get it!
[176:53.39]Open the door!
[176:55.13]Get in the door!
[176:55.97]Get out of the fucking way!
[176:57.88]Get out of the way!
[177:00.14]Oh my god.
[177:01.28]How much does it take to kill a motherfucker like you?
[177:04.62]Is this the explosive?
[177:07.73]This is not an explosive.
[177:16.05]What is in here?
[177:18.64]Oh, there it is.
[177:19.08]Alright, hold on.
[177:23.94]Let me put this back.
[177:25.94]I don't want the sniper rifle anymore.
[177:28.62]Okay, now here's the trick.
[177:29.91]Can I get out of here?
[177:33.17]Let's try.
[177:38.95]Out.
[177:39.71]Out.
[177:41.13]Got it.
[177:42.71]Holy shit.
[177:48.07]Almost drove directly into the ground.
[177:51.31]We're good.
[177:53.02]Made it.
[178:11.11]Who sets a bomb with a one second timer?
[178:20.56]You set a fucking explosive device with a fucking two second timer?
[178:27.33]That's incompetence.
[178:29.33]That has nothing to do with me.
[178:30.21]That's incompetence on this guy's part.
[178:37.78]Okay, so, I'm gonna use my su- How about add an extra couple of seconds, you fucking dickhead?
[178:43.93]How does that sound?
[178:48.49]I gotta go.
[178:49.21]It's gonna blow up my thing, but it's fine.
[178:53.77]Shit.
[178:54.67]No.
[178:55.05]Dammit.
[178:55.35]I need- I want an ATV.
[178:56.35]I want an ATV.
[178:57.15]I want one.
[178:59.05]Is there one down there?
[179:03.63]I lost my ATV.
[179:04.54]Oh well.
[179:09.90]Now we're on rails.
[179:10.72]This is essentially the sniper rifle again.
[179:23.14]Save it.
[179:23.52]Can I drive that?
[179:36.83]I can drive that!
[179:37.47]I can drive that!
[179:45.54]What is this thing?
[179:46.56]I can drive this, can't I?
[179:53.87]No, no, no, it's the ATV right there.
[180:16.32]still fucking alive don't throw a grenade looks like you're gonna throw a grenade god damn it god damn it oh my god damn it give me a fuck
[180:49.50]God damn it.
[180:54.40]You know what's not fun about this game?
[180:55.66]Shooting people like 700 times in the body.
[181:07.65]Okay.
[181:09.33]Not gonna happen right now.
[181:10.71]Not this time.
[181:13.41]That sure would have been funny, wouldn't it guys?
[181:17.03]Get off.
[181:20.81]Now we pick people off.
[181:24.96]Now they actually show up on the fucking radar.
[181:34.49]Look at that travel time.
[181:45.49]Why does it want me to rewind?
[181:47.58]No, don't rewind.
[181:59.72]I hit him right in the forehead.
[182:06.09]Well, they're just blowing each other up, so that's fine.
[182:08.89]Ow.
[182:16.63]No!
[182:20.99]That rocked his head back so hard.
[182:29.97]What?
[182:30.65]Oh, you dick.
[182:32.71]You son of a bitch.
[182:34.91]That's not cool.
[182:36.53]Just stop moving around.
[182:37.59]Oh my god.
[182:42.08]Finally.
[182:55.92]I didn't get him.
[183:02.94]No!
[183:03.26]Not the ATV!
[183:04.02]Okay, it's good.
[183:04.52]It's fine.
[183:09.98]Alright, we can move.
[183:13.62]One more guy all the way down there.
[183:15.12]This is going to be a long range shot here.
[183:17.34]Alright, I'm going to shoot it and then we're going to let go.
[183:22.46]Perfect.
[183:23.96]He rolled into it.
[183:26.37]Alright.
[183:27.67]We are free to go.
[183:29.29]That was... That was very annoying.
[183:31.25]That was very painful.
[183:32.68]I know.
[183:37.44]Let's go.
[183:39.70]Got the ATV back.
[183:41.56]All is right in the world.
[183:45.96]These... Okay, there's poison gas here.
[183:54.15]What is...
[183:56.50]What's over here?
[183:57.00]Why does it want me to... Do you see this on the mini-map?
[183:59.86]What's on the mini-map here?
[184:01.33]Oh, it's on the bridge.
[184:02.03]Okay.
[184:09.15]Okay, save it.
[184:15.55]Game saved.
[184:17.17]And here... I gotta get a good running start here.
[184:25.86]I think we're out of it.
[184:28.36]That was easy.
[184:30.25]No big deal.
[184:39.23]Giving me something to weave through, good.
[184:40.69]I like a challenge.
[184:41.42]These guys are fucking climbing the fence?
[185:09.29]Oh, man.
[185:10.23]Oh, man.
[185:12.07]Man!
[185:13.73]Oh, God!
[185:23.20]You got the same thing that I do.
[185:24.36]It's okay.
[185:26.32]We're good.
[185:27.88]Need to chill.
[185:29.56]Reload this.
[185:36.85]There's one.
[185:37.35]There's the other guy.
[185:39.88]Right there.
[185:40.46]Another one on the back.
[185:44.40]He jumped way... I got the guy on the way down, too.
[185:50.40]Last guy.
[185:53.96]No.
[185:54.26]Dead.
[186:00.96]No, that's not a person.
[186:03.78]There you...
[186:29.47]Too many people.
[186:31.67]Way too many human beings.
[186:35.73]Lucky bastard.
[186:38.98]Alright.
[186:40.94]We did it.
[186:42.16]Now I just have to open the gate.
[186:45.66]However I open the gate.
[186:46.74]That's a question that I don't have an answer to.
[186:48.91]Hold.
[186:58.33]Easy.
[186:59.15]I might have to just jump up here.
[187:03.91]Am I missing something here?
[187:05.56]Try opening it.
[187:07.18]Open gate, please.
[187:08.26]I don't know how you do that.
[187:14.70]Exploded.
[187:17.81]Let's go up.
[187:22.57]Over here?
[187:28.67]Yeah.
[187:31.97]He didn't think I was gonna bring the ATV.
[187:41.34]You guys didn't think the ATV was gonna be able to make it up here?
[187:47.16]Oh, I so badly wanted to.
[187:48.16]Should I try?
[187:48.66]Should I try to get the ATV up here?
[187:51.62]It's not gonna work.
[187:53.78]No, it ain't gonna work.
[187:54.90]Sorry, ATV.
[187:55.66]There's another one, like, right here, probably.
[187:58.66]Unless I can open the... Can I open the door from back here?
[188:02.55]I don't think so.
[188:04.21]This is like... All you guys saying yes right now, you do realize that there's like a line of ATVs.
[188:11.64]That would have been such a waste of time.
[188:18.60]Thank you, Purple Rose, for the five dollars.
[188:21.56]Been working on a research matrix for the last four hours and finally finished.
[188:24.73]Thanks for the company.
[188:25.57]Well, thanks for, uh... Thank you for the company.
[188:31.18]And thanks for the $5.
[188:33.80]Cigarette spaghetti, a little while ago, we were having a lot of issues.
[188:37.70]Cigarettes, thanks for the... Thanks for the, like, 50 plus, $52.
[188:40.91]Is that it?
[188:49.05]Why can't people drive cars in this game?
[188:53.56]You need to look at the car.
[188:55.88]Are you fucking eating a fucking plate of tacos?
[189:00.26]Why?
[189:00.78]And why would that kill me?
[189:01.96]Dude just fucking drove like that guy was... Where's this gonna put me?
[189:22.65]Okay.
[189:23.99]I need to know something here.
[189:25.15]Like, I'm gonna... We need to watch this.
[189:28.65]I need to see what happens here, because that doesn't make any fucking sense.
[189:36.03]This is not gonna kill me, right?
[189:37.44]Of course it is.
[189:39.40]Just because you fucking stopped time doesn't mean you don't die from gravity.
[189:43.40]For some reason, I felt like gravity didn't exist, and...
[189:58.58]Get up here.
[190:05.52]Climb down.
[190:09.58]And that doesn't kill me.
[190:10.56]So let's see this.
[190:11.20]What happens here?
[190:16.76]He's literally beeping at me.
[190:17.86]Will he run into me?
[190:23.48]Why would he beep?
[190:24.82]He's beeping.
[190:31.08]Why would you beep?
[190:35.14]Excuse me, I'm coming through.
[190:40.12]Excuse me.
[190:42.82]And why did the fall not kill me that time?
[190:49.13]Is it slow motion?
[190:49.85]It is, isn't it?
[190:52.13]Okay.
[190:56.07]Beep, beep.
[190:57.85]Oh, hey, hey, I know you.
[190:59.52]You're that guy we're after.
[191:03.90]It was this guy.
[191:06.72]It was him the whole time.
[191:07.74]He ghost-rid the car.
[191:16.53]What a terrible way to come... What an awful way to go about doing this.
[191:22.75]He...
[191:33.32]Imagine, imagine being like a military personnel.
[191:37.78]And your job is to go get the guy that's over here.
[191:40.55]There's a guy coming to shoot the guy.
[191:44.13]You get in like a huge tanker.
[191:45.67]And you drive like 60 miles per hour towards where I am without any backup.
[191:50.87]You come in here by yourself.
[191:51.74]You're alone.
[191:53.60]Alone.
[191:55.64]And you ghost ride the car into a tower which you own.
[192:01.66]To fight me by yourself.
[192:06.78]Well, that was cool.
[192:08.82]Wait.
[192:11.04]Wait a minute.
[192:13.14]We're going back.
[192:15.68]This is really fucking important.
[192:18.30]If you don't think this is important, I'm sorry it is.
[192:21.43]We're gonna hit that plane on the way over.
[192:27.81]I'm gonna do this a couple times.
[192:29.31]So, I hope you're ready.
[192:30.29]You're gonna just chill out here for a few minutes.
[192:32.88]I'm gonna run into the plane.
[192:45.33]I think I think I didn't get to the plane spawn point Am I gonna play I'm not gonna play the daddy dating simulator YouTuber, please play my video game video game It seems like it could be a funny game
[193:15.18]I think I missed.
[193:19.72]I need to stop it at the right time.
[193:22.00]Yeah.
[193:27.17]The soldier get the tank over the jump.
[193:33.33]Yeah, hold on.
[193:34.49]How did that guy get over this jump?
[193:42.80]Come back.
[193:47.66]I'll get it.
[193:48.00]I'm gonna be here for a while.
[193:52.75]Wait, I need to do this.
[193:54.03]It's going to happen.
[193:55.89]I gotta wait.
[193:56.39]I gotta see the exact moment where it loads.
[194:03.02]I'll give this like two or three more attempts.
[194:04.98]This is going in the video.
[194:17.98]Damn it.
[194:18.89]This is possible, and I would normally sit here for like an hour to get this to work, but for the purpose of the stream, we gotta go.
[194:28.23]Might be too high up anyway.
[194:42.04]Nope, it's alright.
[194:43.76]We tried.
[194:45.10]We gave it a try.
[194:45.80]I ain't gonna sit here for a long time.
[194:50.71]Let's just get out.
[194:53.88]Quad boost.
[194:56.50]This looks like a loading screen area.
[195:09.11]What?
[195:09.29]Am I underwater?
[195:16.69]Okay.
[195:19.35]Fuck the stream, do it.
[195:23.41]Fuck the stream, do it.
[195:28.59]I got one more chance to do it again.
[195:31.76]Lethal electrical source detected.
[195:33.12]Can I make this jump?
[195:33.98]Am I able to make this jump?
[195:38.86]Like, I'm loading it.
[195:40.02]I want the fucking car.
[195:40.98]I want the car.
[195:41.52]No, like, I just fell off.
[195:43.06]It's okay.
[195:44.12]I got to punch it over this and we'll make it.
[195:49.42]Even the game wants me to do it again.
[195:50.70]Alright, just gotta go fast.
[196:02.01]Line it up.
[196:06.17]Can't take the car.
[196:08.00]You cannot take the car with you.
[196:10.82]Unfortunately.
[196:12.60]Get off there!
[196:13.08]I can't...
[196:21.30]I just panicked.
[196:22.36]I panicked and fucking reloaded.
[196:31.69]I'm on the fucking water.
[196:40.67]We're gonna have to do it again.
[196:41.43]Okay.
[196:43.22]So I can just drive on the water.
[196:46.68]When it's paused, I can just gently drive over it.
[196:56.08]Pause and then drive in the water, yeah.
[196:58.38]That's what I'm gonna do.
[197:02.32]Why do I suck?
[197:04.18]Because I'm trying to do dumb things.
[197:08.10]I could do this right, and you know how you do this right?
[197:10.34]You fucking get off.
[197:11.88]And walk.
[197:18.99]And that- Unbelievable.
[197:24.04]I'm not even going to get it.
[197:24.82]I'm going to be walking again.
[197:25.80]Glad we took all that time.
[197:26.40]Accelerate the schedule.
[197:26.93]If you need help, get it.
[197:46.12]They actually stayed with us.
[197:48.74]Good.
[197:49.38]And they're gonna... you're gonna fuck me here?
[197:54.62]And I can't even... I couldn't even take it to begin with.
[197:57.32]Not gonna tell me I can't take something game.
[197:58.88]Fuck off, I'm taking it.
[198:01.36]I'm going to take this.
[198:24.15]Okay.
[198:25.39]I gotta get this in here.
[198:35.11]Damn it.
[198:35.45]Never mind.
[198:35.95]Let's go.
[198:36.35]That's so sad.
[198:45.42]Oh, that's depressing me.
[198:50.62]You know... Yep.
[198:55.44]If, uh... I have nothing.
[198:59.98]I get nothing.
[199:02.28]I could have said something, but, like... That's... Okay.
[199:10.77]Okay, I can't drive up the wall.
[199:15.45]Everyone's saying, drive up the wall.
[199:26.85]Not gonna work.
[199:27.80]Get this off me.
[199:31.42]There's no fucking ammo in there.
[199:32.64]Oh, please.
[199:33.44]No, don't bounce back into me.
[200:04.22]I feel like I'm playing Bulletstorm.
[200:07.89]Remember Bulletstorm?
[200:10.03]And none of these people were even here the last time.
[200:23.38]Am I going crazy?
[200:25.60]Or, like... I have to be going crazy.
[200:31.96]What the fuck is this?
[200:35.47]Oh, it's a video game, Kirby.
[200:36.49]Of course you don't know.
[200:52.52]I got it.
[200:55.04]At least I got that guy.
[200:56.04]I'm gonna wait.
[201:06.94]Got it.
[201:08.26]Perfect.
[201:08.88]Ballistic threat detected.
[201:11.84]What does that mean?
[201:12.46]You're shooting like bombs or something.
[201:16.71]Yeah, you are.
[201:19.79]Well, I didn't know where you're coming from because I don't know.
[201:33.28]Got him.
[201:35.55]Well, rocket launcher is coming up soon, probably.
[201:40.55]That's interesting, isn't it?
[201:41.61]Alright, give me a second.
[201:46.53]Let me... Look at that.
[201:49.34]Perfect.
[201:50.06]What is this thing?
[201:51.24]No, that's not what I wanted.
[201:52.18]This is a... There it is.
[201:55.48]We got ourselves a rocket launcher.
[201:59.30]I knew it.
[202:00.10]I knew eventually if we were patient enough, we would get one.
[202:04.92]Uh, get rid of the sniper rifle.
[202:06.58]These are all kind of long range.
[202:07.86]I don't know if I want this.
[202:11.57]Uh, this thing sucks, I think.
[202:12.95]The sniper rifle just does the same thing.
[202:14.73]This thing just makes a funny explosion.
[202:17.89]Who wants a funny explosion?
[202:18.91]I need, like, a gun.
[202:19.61]Give me this thing.
[202:22.11]Yeah, that's better.
[202:35.95]Frostbow has more ammo?
[202:36.47]Aaaah. Fine. But it has travel time. It has like a extra few shots, for a long travel time and a explosion.
[202:53.47]Who doesn't want a funny explosion? You know what, you're right. Who doesn't want a funny explosion?
[202:56.47]What am I thinking? What am I thinking here?
[203:15.09]That guy was still alive.
[203:20.37]Be aware of that, chat.
[203:21.91]He was alive.
[203:24.59]Oh, I gotta pee bad.
[203:26.07]No, don't go back inside of a building.
[203:28.58]Objective failed.
[203:35.45]Oh, I don't care.
[203:36.59]You think I care about the objective right now?
[203:40.52]You're sorely mistaken.
[203:51.14]I was supposed... Okay, I was about to say, what?
[203:54.11]I was supposed to come out here?
[203:57.01]Wait!
[204:01.21]Wait!
[204:01.65]No, come back!
[204:06.91]dammit I gotta pee I'll be right back gotta pee I'll see you guys in a moment one moment
[205:54.81]Hi guys.
[205:59.28]Let's head back to it.
[206:00.26]Okay.
[206:10.30]Did I wash my hands?
[206:11.76]Yes, I did.
[206:16.86]Let's move.
[206:22.50]Nope.
[206:23.34]That ain't gonna happen.
[206:24.98]Sorry.
[206:25.48]Oh, wait.
[206:26.30]Hold on.
[206:26.84]Wait.
[206:27.48]Wait.
[206:27.76]Wait.
[206:28.16]Wait.
[206:28.92]Okay.
[206:29.32]We're safe.
[206:33.68]Almost got me.
[206:35.36]Like four times.
[206:40.02]Oh, that's a toilet.
[206:45.04]That's an outhouse with, like, shit in it.
[206:46.50]Okay.
[206:47.78]I was looking in there for items.
[206:52.79]Target is hostile.
[206:59.74]okay I wish somebody was in there going to the bathroom that would have been such a jokey Metal Gear Solid funny diarrhea moment
[207:30.43]Where's this other dude?
[207:32.01]Was that a grenade that he just threw?
[207:33.12]Oh my lord.
[207:41.02]No, no rocket launcher.
[207:41.90]That's going to get me killed.
[207:57.01]I hate how they have grenades and how they're smart with them.
[208:07.37]I'm thinking of grenades.
[208:08.53]I'll take one of my own.
[208:09.67]Somebody's in here with me.
[208:22.50]Oh, my... Yeah.
[208:24.04]Go.
[208:32.23]This is a lot harder than it looks.
[208:48.22]I'm going to tell you something that I really don't like.
[208:51.44]Pushing in the right stick to aim down sights.
[208:55.97]Come on.
[208:56.59]What is this?
[208:58.27]What is this, man?
[208:59.77]I guess I'll
[209:01.93]Huh?
[209:03.19]Oh, he died.
[209:12.11]Looking for this last person.
[209:13.97]Where are they?
[209:14.51]Explode!
[209:33.05]I had to concentrate there for a second.
[209:34.33]Sorry.
[209:37.65]Don't touch the electric fence.
[209:40.96]I'm not touching the electric fence for some dumb joke.
[209:43.22]And look at how many more people just showed up.
[209:45.32]Get in the fucking outhouse.
[209:48.92]What the fuck?
[209:49.64]Give me a break, dude.
[210:04.03]Give me a break.
[210:07.13]He's unsafe.
[210:16.43]Jesus.
[210:17.45]Oh, that was a save.
[210:36.31]Is there no gun?
[210:36.93]There's no bullets in this gun.
[210:41.41]Shit!
[210:41.71]By golly!
[211:05.87]There's this other dude.
[211:08.01]Where are you?
[211:09.81]Where is he?
[211:11.13]Am I blind?
[211:11.83]Where is he?
[211:12.59]Oh, he's right here.
[211:28.04]I didn't get it, did I?
[211:30.70]This is too stressful, man.
[211:32.02]It really is.
[211:37.32]This guy, I swear to God.
[211:40.56]Put your head up.
[211:46.35]ATV?
[211:48.81]No.
[211:49.33]Just on the mini-map still.
[211:50.35]Damn it.
[211:51.39]Alright, give me a second.
[211:52.21]Let me say thank you to some people.
[211:54.55]A lot of bits came in and I didn't even recognize that they existed.
[211:59.33]Fump.
[211:59.81]Thank you, Fump.
[212:01.41]Butt.
[212:02.23]Kiss.
[212:04.37]Thanks for the $20.
[212:06.00]Jerma, I watch your content every single night before bed.
[212:08.24]Always have.
[212:09.34]You are special in my heart.
[212:10.56]Well, thank you.
[212:11.82]Thank you for the $20.
[212:12.66]Very generous of you.
[212:14.26]Glad you're enjoying the stream.
[212:16.18]Thanks for the $20.
[212:16.62]The $20 spot.
[212:20.22]Eefs, thank you for the $15.
[212:22.04]Loving the stream, Jerma, and loving you also.
[212:25.57]Quick random question.
[212:26.35]Do you have a favorite Overwatch character?
[212:28.07]It was Roadhog, but apparently Roadhog sucks now.
[212:30.69]I haven't played... I have not really played Overwatch in a long time.
[212:37.79]I, like, tried to play it, like, not that long ago, maybe, like, a couple weeks ago, just to mess around, and then before that was, like, like a year ago.
[212:44.67]But it was Roadhog.
[212:46.65]Also, forgot to give the other 100 bits.
[212:49.49]Fuck me.
[212:50.03]Oh, well, thanks for the $15, uh, Fs.
[212:52.49]Eefs.
[212:53.47]Purple Rose Tattoo gave $5.
[212:55.85]Working all you.
[212:56.65]Gotcha.
[212:57.07]Gotcha already.
[212:57.67]Just making sure I didn't miss anybody.
[212:58.62]I think I did miss somebody.
[213:07.78]Gotta pull a lever.
[213:10.98]Missed a lever, for sure.
[213:13.04]Yep, there's a little button here.
[213:16.16]Here it comes.
[213:29.37]Fucking fake red barrel.
[213:36.01]I can't rewind.
[213:37.47]Why?
[213:38.19]Out of fucking ammo.
[213:48.72]Why are they so much better than me?
[213:51.96]They were all just... I could complain right now, but I'm not going to.
[213:56.69]Dumb red barrel bullshit.
[214:05.28]There he is, right in the face.
[214:13.52]Hello!
[214:14.64]Goodbye.
[214:19.26]Yo, these NPCs are aimbotting.
[214:21.78]They really- They've- There was no- Where was that car?
[214:32.93]It's so confusing!
[214:35.87]Like, they just come out of nowhere.
[214:41.33]This seems like a fun game.
[214:49.38]I don't hate this game.
[214:52.99]Oh, look, I held another person.
[214:56.73]Hi.
[214:59.97]New objectives.
[215:05.91]Spin the wheel.
[215:11.67]Yeah.
[215:12.43]Get it all the way up there and then... What?
[215:20.62]Mm-hmm.
[215:21.28]Go up.
[215:27.06]Oh.
[215:30.44]Why would it come back down here?
[215:33.03]Why would I come back down?
[215:34.11]Like, why?
[215:35.07]Why?
[215:36.11]Why are you coming back down?
[215:37.13]Okay.
[215:46.04]Like... Stay the fuck up there.
[215:52.46]This is some dead guy in here, too.
[215:53.78]That's great.
[215:54.10]I feel like we're gonna have to do that a lot.
[216:04.73]I'm gonna have to scale this mountain.
[216:11.22]I'm gonna fall off and die.
[216:12.56]I already know what's gonna happen.
[216:14.40]I'm certain of it.
[216:17.79]Someone's gonna peek-a-boo me and it's gonna scare me and I'm gonna lose.
[216:35.25]I don't think I'm doing this right.
[216:44.04]I can't leave.
[216:44.76]It's giving me a fucking headache.
[216:59.81]What do you mean staff only?
[217:07.12]What are these?
[217:08.96]Do I have to go back down?
[217:13.72]It's a fucking haunted house with mirrors.
[217:15.74]It's one of those mirror things.
[217:18.63]Where you can't even see five feet in front of your face.
[217:24.63]Look at the ground.
[217:25.33]The shadows.
[217:26.19]I don't even understand what the fuck is going on right now.
[217:36.16]Now it wants me to go back down, but I just came up here.
[217:38.36]It's giving me a fucking headache.
[217:52.53]Is this music?
[218:03.38]Is there music playing right now?
[218:18.29]Can I get down here?
[218:30.22]I have no idea what's going on.
[218:35.52]Everything looks identical in my brain.
[218:37.17]I can't fucking... Everything is the same.
[218:53.67]fucking -2 letter grades for this shitty fucking part of the game.
[218:56.19]Alright, get the fuck back down here.
[219:04.10]Let me get back up to, like, the cheese grater part of the game, where the shadows, even the shadows, even the shadows hurt your fucking head.
[219:12.78]Alright, I've been down here.
[219:24.43]Climb up this.
[219:28.84]Okay, now I'm up here.
[219:31.64]Is this where... I needed to go this way.
[219:37.96]Orange power.
[219:39.48]No.
[219:44.02]Your voice hurts my head.
[219:45.20]Get the fuck out of here!
[219:53.26]Fuck off!
[219:58.24]Can I climb that?
[220:10.81]Ban that guy.
[220:18.62]I can't do it.
[220:20.22]I don't know what to do.
[220:21.92]I swear to God.
[220:22.46]I'm not kidding.
[220:23.12]I don't know what the fuck to do.
[220:29.25]I don't know where it wants me to go.
[220:30.69]I really don't.
[220:44.46]Because that just brings me back down.
[220:49.37]Lost in a maze.
[220:55.15]Rewind back to when the building was being constructed.
[220:58.49]Like, I'm supposed to be going down.
[221:00.85]But, like, what the fuck is it even talking about?
[221:10.81]Like, this way?
[221:15.81]Okay.
[221:16.61]But, like, now what the fuck does it want me to do?
[221:40.74]Please end this.
[221:42.80]Like, okay.
[221:43.59]You're talking about like here, right?
[221:47.31]That's where I... Isn't that where I came from?
[221:54.96]It's right there.
[221:56.84]I can't see.
[221:58.04]I hope you guys understand this.
[221:59.58]I can't see.
[222:01.96]It's in my brain.
[222:04.98]I'm literally not going to move.
[222:21.67]Alright, I'm gonna sit with my fucking back at the edge of this goddamn fucking thing.
[222:29.85]So where from here am I supposed to go in this pile of shit fucking game?
[222:37.30]I'm just gonna stand right fucking here.
[222:39.80]From this spot right here, which way do I go?
[222:43.56]From this spot exactly right here.
[222:52.04]Turn the camera 45 degrees.
[222:54.42]So down here.
[222:55.42]This way.
[223:01.42]Talk about down here.
[223:09.08]Alright.
[223:14.18]Over the crate.
[223:15.26]Over the crate and down.
[223:20.50]Down like here?
[223:27.30]I'm looking down right here.
[223:31.73]Down here.
[223:32.59]Down here.
[223:35.69]Okay, we've gone down here.
[223:37.13]This is where I killed that guy.
[223:46.56]This is where I shot that guy.
[223:57.71]Oh, where do I go?
[224:08.26]Yeah.
[224:12.22]Everything just blends in, man.
[224:13.72]It really does.
[224:14.42]Now what do you want me to do?
[224:18.11]You want me to shoot this down?
[224:20.53]Got it.
[224:32.55]I think it might be time for Papa Jeremy to go to bed.
[224:39.97]Look at this shit.
[224:42.83]You fucking idiots that made this game.
[224:45.61]Couldn't have made the fucking wire a different color.
[224:48.43]This just hurts my fucking whole body.
[224:54.29]Fucking D minus game now.
[224:55.73]It was a B. This was a B until this.
[224:57.44]Now it's a fucking D minus.
[225:00.34]No, sorry.
[225:01.58]Sorry about that.
[225:02.60]Let me rephrase that.
[225:04.58]F. Just keep that there just to fucking remind you guys what kind of game we're playing right now.
[225:36.80]Shut up, bird.
[225:41.24]Why is the F so blurry?
[225:42.56]I don't know.
[225:48.50]I'm glad you guys can be here too.
[225:50.08]To see me, to witness me.
[225:51.72]To witness me.
[225:54.84]I don't even know where he's going.
[225:59.10]That guy with two.
[226:04.85]Oh, make sure you shoot the red barrels!
[226:07.11]Oh, those ones explode though!
[226:09.87]Don't you know?
[226:10.71]Sometimes they explode.
[226:20.12]Got it.
[226:25.10]Increase the font size?
[226:26.12]I'm gonna remove it in like a... Did you really just do that to me?
[226:35.61]These guys are really trigger-happy when it comes to grenades.
[226:46.08]I'm gonna die and spawn at the building.
[226:49.86]A bug just got in here.
[226:52.51]No, not anymore of this.
[226:53.45]Not anymore of this.
[226:54.61]This looks complicated.
[226:55.57]This looks complicated.
[226:57.80]I'm like sleepy.
[226:59.86]I woke up at like 4 o'clock in the morning this morning.
[227:06.44]That's a true statement.
[227:08.56]I've been awake for a while.
[227:09.84]I see the electricity.
[227:13.35]You think I'm stupid?
[227:14.97]Search the area for train tracks.
[227:16.83]They should lead you right to the prison.
[227:18.65]Good luck.
[227:21.54]Search the area for train tracks.
[227:22.80]What?
[227:27.17]Speaking of puking, by the way.
[227:38.46]Oh, you're trying to make me vomit.
[227:40.06]You just are.
[227:40.88]You just want me to.
[227:42.60]I get it.
[227:42.96]You want me to throw up on stream.
[227:57.59]F. Why am I still tilted?
[228:15.06]Oh, I get... Saving content.
[228:25.04]I gotta watch out for the giant blade.
[228:26.10]Yeah, I gotta pause time, slow down time, and get through this.
[228:29.85]I understand what it wants me to do.
[228:30.95]Look at that.
[228:45.31]I had... It was right.
[228:46.41]I had it right.
[228:49.41]It was close enough.
[228:53.78]It was close enough.
[228:57.64]Why did I think that I was going to be able to just ski with it?
[229:08.18]We're fine.
[229:09.86]I got it.
[229:10.64]I hate how that ATV is still on the minimap.
[229:12.87]I want to just wipe it off.
[229:27.65]Okay, get me out.
[229:39.35]Another one of these 10,000 enemies.
[229:42.92]What is that?
[229:46.48]Oh, I'm looking at the rocket launcher.
[229:51.46]I thought I was going to be holding a rocket.
[229:52.82]That would have been fucking awesome.
[230:04.61]Cool.
[230:08.01]That was pretty cool.
[230:09.01]Except I didn't kill any of these people.
[230:11.56]I thought I did.
[230:13.54]Alright, don't over... They have rocket launchers.
[230:23.02]I'm not gonna overstep my boundaries here.
[230:24.54]Ow!
[230:40.77]Whoa.
[230:43.53]I can't hide.
[230:44.05]And one more.
[230:47.43]No.
[230:47.75]Just at the.
[230:53.58]Whew.
[230:53.76]Wow.
[230:53.98]Stop.
[230:54.08]Stop.
[230:55.48]What?
[231:15.55]Is chat hitting their knees against their desk?
[231:20.83]Explosive material detected in proximity.
[231:25.26]I don't necessarily know what that means, so we're gonna save the game.
[231:29.22]We get to ride the train again.
[231:35.00]Okay.
[231:44.81]What's the point of pulling the lever?
[231:51.73]Should I go backwards?
[231:54.67]Base of action required.
[231:56.09]Alright, go for it.
[232:04.36]Nice.
[232:09.58]Do it again with this one, right?
[232:25.24]Almost just had to restart the game.
[232:29.08]Stop.
[232:29.34]Please don't do that to me again.
[232:30.38]Before I lose my gosh dang marbles.
[232:37.73]Evasive action required.
[232:40.67]I had Sam run the probability of an alternate stream colliding with ours.
[232:44.89]I re-ran this a hundred different ways.
[232:49.13]These cutscenes are so bad.
[232:50.23]Alright, Fumpkiss, thanks for the, uh...
[232:53.08]Well, it's alright, because I'm going to be around forever.
[233:04.73]I'm going to be around a very long time.
[233:08.08]Alternate Garfield stream.
[233:10.08]Thank you, Fump.
[233:10.70]Also, thank you to Blue Ape.
[233:12.50]He wrote Failfish.
[233:15.56]Yep.
[233:16.50]Pretty much.
[233:17.76]Also, Esua.
[233:21.09]S-U-A.
[233:22.77]Thank you for the $5.10.
[233:23.61]Here you go, Puzzle Boy.
[233:25.65]You deserve it.
[233:31.83]Let's go.
[233:32.45]Press the button.
[233:35.75]Who's working on that blacksmithing?
[233:37.97]World of Warcraft reference.
[233:40.65]I get at least 200 PogChamp for that one.
[233:44.11]Hey, he's not supposed to be here!
[233:48.37]Hey!
[233:49.35]Stop him!
[233:51.35]Right?
[233:51.63]Something like that.
[233:52.83]Here's what we're going to do.
[234:01.15]Ready?
[234:04.69]Oh, what?
[234:05.27]I wanted to... I got one person.
[234:12.40]Some rocket launcher you are.
[234:16.28]Why do I have this?
[234:23.95]Left trigger I keep trying to do.
[234:25.43]I'm actually going to... You know what?
[234:27.50]I might just go in to the options and change it.
[234:30.54]Left trigger to me is aim down sights.
[234:32.90]Why is right stick aim down sights?
[234:34.64]Fucking F-.
[234:46.43]That was a funny explosion.
[234:59.57]What's this down there?
[235:01.30]I don't know.
[235:02.32]Somebody is.
[235:02.82]Is that a new gun?
[235:06.18]What is this?
[235:07.72]Oh, it's just a shitty pistol.
[235:19.24]I'm just, like, injuring this guy's ears.
[235:22.64]I'm just missing.
[235:23.31]Okay.
[235:28.92]The buttons are just all wrong.
[235:31.66]They're all wrong.
[235:32.60]He's reading a book?
[235:51.77]Got it.
[235:54.93]Stupid flying people.
[236:05.84]For the past four hours, I've been playing with these buttons, but for some reason, they're wrong.
[236:09.98]Well, I've played this game for four hours.
[236:13.12]I've played probably like 600 first-person shooters with a controller in my hand, and it's never right stick.
[236:22.69]It's left trigger.
[236:25.00]Four hours.
[236:26.40]Four hours.
[236:27.40]Versus 600 games.
[236:30.28]Four hours.
[236:32.60]600 video games.
[236:38.05]Beating them all.
[236:39.51]Fucking hardest difficulty, by the way.
[236:53.10]FPS on console.
[236:54.91]Alright, we're just going to go across this.
[236:57.73]Very slowly, apparently.
[237:03.75]It's tough.
[237:05.69]Concealed threat detected.
[237:07.65]What?
[237:08.07]What's going to... Oh, here comes a train.
[237:20.65]I was really hoping that... Don't hold them.
[237:29.09]I was hoping that I was gonna run them over.
[237:30.33]Oh, come on.
[237:34.87]Give me a fucking break.
[237:37.85]That's what I get for, like, trying to be cameraman.
[237:41.03]And I have, like... I gotta get rid of these two piece of... This thing sucks.
[237:47.87]Let's just use all the bullets now.
[238:08.24]Everybody's alive.
[238:11.03]That's the, ladies and gentlemen, rocket launcher.
[238:15.44]It's a rocket launcher.
[238:16.38]Explosion.
[238:19.94]Replacing that the second I'm able to.
[238:40.06]What's wrong with this guy?
[238:51.19]They're just spitballs.
[239:11.17]Let me take that gun from him Getting left trigger to aim I fucking do it just do it now.
[239:34.28]Oh
[240:07.95]That was like a Vince McMahon, by the way.
[240:20.09]Do it!
[240:21.19]Do it now!
[240:26.90]Here they come.
[240:35.28]Missed him, of course.
[240:36.22]Stay right.
[240:36.70]Okay.
[240:44.08]Where you going, buddy?
[240:44.82]Alright.
[240:53.19]Shall we save this video game?
[240:55.01]Oh my god, okay.
[240:58.43]Who in their right mind uses LT to shoot?
[241:01.45]LT to aim!
[241:03.65]LT to- Like this!
[241:06.21]Like this.
[241:08.53]Have you played CallOfDuty.com?
[241:15.65]Go read the book.
[241:20.62]Oh shit, I wasn't fast enough.
[241:21.90]Hold on.
[241:22.34]I wasn't fast enough.
[241:28.34]Alright, we're good.
[241:37.32]Sorry, that's an adult website.
[241:38.42]I'm not allowed to go to that.
[241:40.34]Time-slowing threat detected.
[241:43.68]What?
[241:45.84]It's a new enemy type.
[241:52.71]And I need to reload this gun, too.
[241:54.39]Like, jeez.
[241:55.51]I thought that was a floating sword.
[241:57.09]Okay.
[242:10.60]That's a new gun, too.
[242:16.44]Alright, what is this?
[242:23.13]And how do I immediately throw away this rocket launcher?
[242:39.98]Get out of here.
[242:41.50]I don't even care what this is.
[242:42.38]Way cooler.
[242:51.09]Holy shit, he's still playing this game.
[242:55.29]Well, not for long.
[242:56.85]Not for long.
[242:57.53]I am going to probably end this stream.
[243:03.30]Follows the cursor.
[243:04.12]Well, good luck using sticks to do that.
[243:12.57]What else is in here?
[243:16.15]Oh.
[243:17.84]Well, I gotta hold on to this.
[243:23.04]It's killing me, actually.
[243:24.42]So, that's not gonna happen.
[243:36.09]Mm-hmm.
[243:36.85]We all know what happens when this goes off.
[243:40.53]Run away!
[243:43.29]Am I gonna complete the game?
[243:45.27]Uh, probably not.
[243:48.17]I would assume probably not.
[243:51.09]I just wanted to check it out.
[243:53.75]I remember it existing and I thought it was fun.
[243:57.00]It is fun.
[244:00.08]I would say this is a, like, a solid... a solid video game.
[244:05.41]If you can get it.
[244:07.84]Well, let's put it this way.
[244:08.64]A solid video game for, like, 2000... 2007.
[244:11.08]It's a pretty solid video game.
[244:17.74]So, go back to, like, when you were, like, 10 years ago.
[244:21.57]And... Play it.
[244:23.27]You might like it.
[244:27.31]You gave it an F. What happened to the F?
[244:30.44]Oh, it gets a fucking F. This game is an F.
[244:35.26]That doesn't mean it's not fun to play.
[244:36.46]It's not a good game.
[244:43.42]You can have an F and still pass.
[244:47.96]You can get an F on the exam and pass the class.
[244:53.85]No, I'm not doing it.
[244:55.45]Oh, it's not one of these.
[244:59.65]Like, no, okay, hold on.
[245:00.95]So there was a couple of tests.
[245:04.04]There was a few Fs that I admit, but the class as a whole, it was alright.
[245:08.90]The teacher was cool.
[245:10.14]One of those cool teachers, you know what I mean?
[245:28.84]Suspect spotted!
[245:29.98]Hurry!
[245:34.90]Do I have to let this guy to jail?
[245:40.02]Whoa!
[245:40.48]You know, if there's a chain link fence, I can no longer play this game.
[245:57.59]It is so painful for me to look at that I lose track of everything else.
[246:13.17]Yeah, put a chain link fence in the game for me and I cannot play it anymore.
[246:23.65]It's like somebody taking both their thumbnails and digging them into my eyes while I'm screaming.
[246:28.72]Now I'm gonna give this one more attempt and then I'm going to pass.
[246:40.70]The F stands for fence.
[246:47.69]Trailing fence.
[246:48.69]Well, there's another fucking F on an exam, and it's another fence related F. Okay, so I gotta free the prisoners.
[247:12.02]Okay.
[247:17.42]I'm just going to sit here and we're just going to do this.
[247:33.31]Two hits, three hits.
[247:48.94]Shut up.
[247:50.88]Right in the head.
[247:52.78]Die.
[247:53.00]No.
[247:53.08]Go to... Tap.
[247:54.00]Ow.
[247:54.20]You guys hurt.
[248:24.31]One more where he's right there.
[248:25.77]We did it!
[248:32.65]Well, apparently we didn't do it.
[248:41.09]I'm the one coming to rescue your ass.
[248:43.70]Let me just press this button.
[248:49.45]Hey, you're all free.
[248:51.42]Oh no, they fucking notified the Ministry of Magic.
[249:07.83]Oh my god, cigarette spaghetti again with 50 bucks.
[249:12.41]The F stands for fitty.
[249:15.87]I have some serious determination for sticking to this game.
[249:18.62]Well, thank you.
[249:25.30]That was all of you guys cheering that I'm not playing this game anymore.
[249:33.54]I'm talking about, yeah, I'm not gonna play the game.
[249:35.26]I'm like done and everyone's just fucking cheering.
[249:41.47]But for now get up to the train platform Delta bats gonna need medical attention so let me take you back from there Thank You cigarette where this thing is cigarette spaghetti Getting us to crone for now find some transpo and head south I've got reinforcements coming to rendezvous with you
[250:09.25]Is that a typo that the actor just kept in?
[250:15.12]Hey, look at this.
[250:16.74]We got the forgotten.
[250:20.30]Why is it casual?
[250:22.02]I'm playing unskilled.
[250:23.03]There it is.
[250:31.03]Don't stop.
[250:31.47]I've never known fences could be so much fun until watching.
[250:36.83]Ah, the stream goes on.
[250:37.61]Well, the stream goes... I'm remembering a message.
[250:40.27]Whatever.
[250:40.68]I'm trying to go off-trance.
[251:07.13]Alright.
[251:07.65]The stream goes on until we have one more.
[251:09.74]We got one life.
[251:11.64]One life and we're done.
[251:18.02]The trees are like GTA trees.
[251:20.67]I'm glad they got that still in this game.
[251:24.59]I'm glad they took that from Grand Theft Auto.
[251:25.93]Hahaha.
[251:38.46]Alright, I made it.
[251:39.22]And only one worker died.
[251:42.37]Whoa.
[251:43.83]What?
[251:52.59]What's up there?
[251:54.32]They're up there.
[251:54.98]What the hell are you doing up there?
[251:56.82]Okay.
[252:13.24]Oh, this is so hard to aim like that.
[252:15.28]It's impossible.
[252:16.72]It's a physical impossibility for my brain to do this.
[252:18.90]Why are you still... What?
[252:29.51]How are you alive?
[252:30.13]That's a big blip down there.
[252:36.63]Why?
[252:38.49]You are still alive too.
[252:40.95]Too many of you are just alive.
[252:45.66]What's the big blip?
[252:46.54]Alright.
[252:47.74]Alright, guys.
[252:48.30]That's gonna be it.
[252:52.73]We'll see you guys tomorrow night for Just Cause 2.
[252:58.17]Sorry, Just Cause 3 multiplayer.
[253:02.41]Me and Etalyx are going to play it.
[253:03.82]Hopefully it's worth playing.
[253:06.46]And I already know what I got to do here.
[253:07.74]So let's go ahead and rewind this.
[253:15.33]Okay.
[253:18.46]I'm glad I could get on the, uh, um... Okay, well, you know what?
[253:22.09]It don't even matter.
[253:22.73]Because this is the end.
[253:30.40]Fuck off.
[253:33.66]Yep.
[253:35.62]Don't even care.
[253:39.57]Let's see what we got.
[253:41.37]Don't do it.
[253:41.87]Am I going to finish this game?
[253:43.25]No, probably not.
[253:46.39]Probably a lot more of the same.
[253:47.43]I'm glad at least we got to the point with the cars.
[253:52.81]Anyways.
[253:54.11]I'm so tired.
[253:54.95]Sorry, I'm yawning.
[253:55.86]I apologize.
[253:58.56]What was that magic game?
[254:00.18]The Magic Circle or something?
[254:01.28]You want to check out?
[254:04.88]He's still got four hours.
[254:06.16]Well, you know what?
[254:06.58]If for some reason I need to play a game and I have like nothing to do or I have no plans or anything, then maybe I will play this game again.
[254:14.26]But that's like a 99.999% chance of not happening.
[254:22.80]Good night, everybody.
[254:24.42]Thank you to Moo Means Moo for the bits at the very end.
[254:27.90]Wait, Cigarette Spaghetti gave $50 twice.
[254:31.68]He just gave a- oh my god.
[254:33.31]You've given like fucking 200 bucks this stream or something, dude.
[254:38.21]You're a madman.
[254:40.15]Hey, I enjoyed the stream.
[254:41.43]I wasn't saying it wasn't fun to watch.
[254:43.79]It just looks pretty frustrating to play.
[254:47.30]No, it's good.
[254:48.12]I wish I could play it on PC.
[254:50.02]I would have looked much more... I would have... The game.
[254:55.54]Well, that was my mic.
[254:57.83]I would have enjoyed the game much more if I could play it on PC, but my computer has too many cores to play it.
[255:05.97]No, we gotta... We gotta go, like, one more time.
[255:08.39]We gotta, like, jump off the fucking cliff.
[255:10.65]Because that's funny, right?
[255:13.78]Oh, wait, hold on.
[255:14.26]This is important.
[255:14.96]Wait a minute.
[255:17.06]Is it gonna work?
[255:27.71]No, it's not gonna work.
[255:28.58]Just... Just do it.
[255:31.10]Go.
[255:31.38]Get out.
[255:34.90]Go back.
[255:35.38]I thought I could do something stupid, but I can't.
[255:38.07]Hey, here we are.
[255:38.77]Alright, goodnight, everybody.
[255:42.18]Thanks, though.
[255:42.52]There was a lot of money transactions tonight.
[255:45.88]So, thanks a lot, everybody.
[255:48.42]All the new subs, everybody that was giving money and bits and shit.
[255:51.29]That's never expected, but obviously appreciated.
[255:54.49]You guys are amazing.
[255:56.57]I'll see you guys tomorrow night for Just Cause 3 multiplayer with Etalyx.
[256:04.72]You can disable cores in the BIOS.
[256:06.32]I know, I just... It was not something I wanted to do.
[256:10.80]I didn't want to go into the BIOS and fuck with my computer.
[256:13.52]I don't know how to do that shit.
[256:15.74]It's not something I do.
[256:17.96]I'm the kind of person that would go into my BIOS and try to change a setting.
[256:22.50]And the fucking computer would light on fire.
[256:27.50]I would do something stupid.
[256:28.83]Accidentally.
[256:31.49]But, goodnight.
[256:34.09]Take care, everybody.
[256:34.67]See you soon.
[256:55.27]you
