[00:28.81]Nobody's going to TV.com for any reason.
[00:35.57]The value of that domain was probably $50 million in 2000.
[00:44.46]Not anymore.
[00:45.08]They sat on that way too long if you didn't get rid of it.
[00:52.22]Are you high?
[00:52.74]No.
[00:55.76]Let me tweet this.

[01:38.44]This is a little get well card.
[01:46.62]Look at this.
[01:48.68]I don't deserve this.
[01:53.32]Oh, this is cool.
[01:56.62]I thought that was a dick over there in the left.
[01:58.50]I'm not gonna lie.
[01:59.66]I thought that was just like a sagging dick with like one big ball.
[02:04.00]But it's a happy face.
[02:12.59]Jeremy, don't be sexual.
[02:14.13]Stop being sexual.
[02:15.17]I'm sorry.
[02:18.79]But, I mean... You know what I'm gonna say.
[02:24.87]a little bit more mature recently.
[02:27.11]Over the last few months, if you know what I'm saying.
[02:33.66]What does that say?
[02:36.10]What does this say?
[02:40.26]Og?
[02:40.50]Ippo happy.
[02:46.09]Oh, they're all... It's awesome.
[02:49.67]Thank you.
[02:52.86]we're gonna play more Yakuza and sorry if I sound sick uh the thing happened where I got better I felt really fine last night and into this morning and I took a shower and then it got worse and then it got better then it got worse again so so uh don't mind me if I uh mute the microphone sometimes and just like
[03:18.94]It's probably going to happen.
[03:20.92]By the way, I just want to make sure everybody knows this.
[03:22.98]If you weren't here the other day, I'm negative for COVID.
[03:25.72]I took a test because, you know, if you're coughing, stuffy nose, headache, flu-like symptoms, it's like, okay, I probably should get on top of this.
[03:33.20]No COVID.
[03:33.74]So that's pretty good, right?
[03:36.15]I'm happy about that.
[03:38.53]So we'll just see how it goes.
[03:43.23]God bless.
[03:43.91]Yeah, I know, right?
[03:47.09]Yeah, we're going to pick up right where we left off in Yakuza.
[03:49.93]I was in the middle of getting a potential bowling girlfriend.
[03:55.83]So, that's exciting.
[03:58.05]Very exciting stuff.
[04:02.74]I don't care about the story.
[04:03.98]I don't care about the combat.
[04:05.10]I care about the bowling girlfriend.
[04:06.86]That's it.
[04:08.36]That's why I'm playing this game a second time.
[04:12.60]Do you like Yakuza?
[04:13.42]Yeah, it's pretty good.
[04:14.34]Why are you playing it again?
[04:15.23]Well, you know, it's a...
[04:19.46]I only, I require only one thing.
[04:21.40]Okay?
[04:22.32]From, in like a female interest.
[04:25.03]And you want to come over and just like play Diablo II for like four hours or so?
[04:29.05]And then just like hang out?
[04:29.95]You know, whatever.
[04:31.59]That's all I require.
[04:32.43]That's the only thing I need.
[04:35.61]That's it.
[04:39.28]Yeah, I heard about Vinny.
[04:40.12]That sucks.
[04:41.36]He'll be back though.
[04:42.18]He'll be back stronger than ever.
[04:45.80]He'll be fine.
[04:53.49]He got a suspension, yeah.
[04:56.47]Showing potential nudity on stream.
[05:05.64]He'll be back.
[05:09.50]I look forward to the next stream, Vinny.
[05:15.16]How could you not look forward to a Vinny stream?
[05:18.04]They're all good.
[05:20.18]Alright, let's go.
[05:24.74]He's not here?
[05:25.49]Well, I didn't have to be here.
[05:28.99]I, like, looked at, like, the viewer list.
[05:30.19]Is Vinny here?
[05:30.65]Oh!
[05:31.89]No.
[05:34.03]No, Vinny's awesome.
[05:34.95]He'll be back.
[05:42.66]Can I... How can I... Why can this not work?
[05:46.02]No camera, right?
[05:46.66]No camera?
[05:47.15]Because I'm naked!
[05:55.70]I'm not actually naked, I just don't have a top on.
[05:58.02]Because like, fuck tops, right?
[06:01.30]I wear bottoms, I don't wear tops.
[06:03.50]What the hell am I doing?
[06:06.41]Uh... What?
[06:10.75]Hello?
[06:11.35]Video game?
[06:13.29]Video game?
[06:15.01]Um, I'd like to...
[06:23.02]Alright, let's get back into Yakuza.
[06:24.13]I want to do mini-games.
[06:25.11]I don't even care about playing the game.
[06:28.65]Oh, if you missed it, we got a couple of dragons last time.
[06:31.17]A couple of lizards.
[06:39.70]Where's the health one?
[06:41.08]Oh, here we go.
[06:43.52]So I can send these to my item box, right?
[06:45.94]How do I do that?
[06:48.93]Components?
[06:49.75]What the hell is all this?
[06:52.30]This is not bowling.
[06:55.40]Valuables.
[06:59.17]Go to Club Sunshine.
[07:00.47]Hold on, I will.
[07:03.47]What was the next thing I had to do?
[07:05.84]Wasn't it just have fun a bunch of times?
[07:08.74]Enjoy erotic videos.
[07:09.80]Alright, is this actually erotic videos?
[07:11.68]Wait, am I gonna get banned?
[07:18.38]It's like, oh, Vinny got banned earlier for, like, nudity.
[07:20.96]Like, here, should I get banned too?
[07:22.72]Should I do it?
[07:26.90]What is going on with my controller?
[07:28.46]Stop.
[07:34.43]What happened?
[07:35.01]Why does this thing suck?
[07:37.91]Oh, hold on.
[07:39.01]Can I ask you a few questions?
[07:39.93]Alright, we got stopped by a police officer.
[07:45.45]Stop and search, huh?
[07:49.68]This is the music.
[07:52.05]What's your name and what do you do for a living?
[07:53.63]My name's Kiru.
[07:56.35]I'm in a hurry here.
[07:58.17]And I'm also in a hurry to read the fact that we've got five community subs from Headful of Crap.
[08:04.80]Thank you, Headful of Crap.
[08:06.24]Appreciate that.
[08:08.24]Excellent.
[08:09.54]Well, we've had some trouble around these parts.
[08:11.56]Just to be sure, would you mind if I checked your belongings?
[08:15.52]What am I going to do with any trouble around here?
[08:18.81]Relax, it's just a precaution.
[08:19.77]Can you show me what you're carrying?
[08:21.01]Alright, is it more embarrassing to have a bunch of, like, lizard toys or coke?
[08:30.67]You know what I mean?
[08:31.57]Like, why do you have, like, four lizard toys?
[08:33.55]Okay, you win.
[08:39.45]What should I hand over?
[08:40.29]I mean, should I give him the lizard toy?
[08:48.63]Alright, here.
[08:51.31]How about this?
[08:51.77]This is what I have.
[08:52.71]Hmm.
[08:54.35]This is about as safe as it gets.
[08:56.03]It doesn't look like you're carrying anything dangerous here.
[08:58.37]Take this back.
[09:01.45]I got nothing to hide.
[09:02.82]Did he expect me to hand him a gun or something?
[09:06.94]He didn't search me.
[09:07.70]He just said, hey, could you present me with something?
[09:11.22]What?
[09:12.30]I could have hand... What, am I going to hand him the drugs in my pocket?
[09:16.84]Thank you for your cooperation.
[09:18.20]Give me a break.
[09:18.82]Cops like you are always abusing your power.
[09:21.26]You never stop to think about how much of an inconvenience this is for regular citizens.
[09:25.52]Well, that may be so for other police officers.
[09:27.36]Not for me, though.
[09:28.98]I'm only doing this because it's all good.
[09:30.56]It's all I'm good for.
[09:31.74]Huh?
[09:31.82]What do you mean?
[09:35.26]Oh, never mind about me.
[09:36.64]I'm the one asking the questions here.
[09:39.40]Huh?
[09:40.54]Doesn't make sense.
[09:41.94]I was sure you had something big on you.
[09:44.19]I've got a nose for these things.
[09:45.67]Hmm.
[09:47.57]Well, I guess your nose failed you this time.
[09:50.60]By the way, is your nose broken?
[09:54.08]No, I- God damn it, what the fuck?
[10:04.79]That's- what the fuck?
[10:08.75]My sixth sense tells me I'll find something huge if I dig deep enough.
[10:13.92]I don't know what to say.
[10:14.88]Why does that keep happening?
[10:16.96]I'm a pro at stopping searches until I'm sure you're not a threat.
[10:20.58]I'm going to keep questioning you, okay?
[10:23.64]Not okay.
[10:24.75]Oh, come on, Kirusan.
[10:25.95]Be a good sport.
[10:27.23]It won't take long.
[10:27.85]I just want to be sure.
[10:28.71]I give up fine.
[10:30.71]Have it your way.
[10:31.63]Just keep it short.
[10:32.91]I mean, we'll keep it really short.
[10:34.05]I'm trying to get into the porn theater.
[10:35.39]Come on.
[10:39.64]Alright.
[10:39.96]Thank you.
[10:40.52]My name is Officer Kikuchi.
[10:43.51]I'll see you around.
[10:45.26]Oh, I'm at friendship with Officer Kikuchi.
[10:49.04]You got to know Officer Stop and Search Kikuchi.
[10:51.52]Interacting with him will gradually fill the friendship gauge.
[10:54.68]You can check the status of this gauge at any time in the pause menu.
[10:58.51]Build your friendship with Officer Kikuchi and see what happens.
[11:03.35]No, I don't think I will.
[11:04.47]Oh, wait, porn theater.
[11:13.10]Do you ball?
[11:15.04]If you ball, then you and I are going to be good friends.
[11:22.13]No, I'm not... Is this bad?
[11:23.39]You're going to watch Attack on Titan?
[11:30.11]Oh, shit.
[11:30.55]That's right.
[11:30.87]It comes back.
[11:32.45]That's right.
[11:35.93]Isn't it like... Yeah.
[11:37.40]Maybe.
[11:37.64]Is it okay?
[11:39.24]Okay.
[11:42.93]At Gondhara, you can watch videos of varied cast of gorgeous girls.
[11:47.38]As you meet these women out in the city under certain conditions, new video content will be available.
[11:51.98]Search every corner of town to find your dream girl.
[11:54.14]Hey, S-Ducks, thanks for the 10 community subs.
[12:02.68]That's a lot of money, thank you.
[12:05.02]We charge $800 for one view.
[12:11.55]You're gonna actually stop, Omega Loaf.
[12:15.55]Alright, I'm- I'm gone.
[12:20.51]You're gonna get banned.
[12:21.29]Okay.
[12:21.75]I'm not gonna get banned.
[12:28.67]No, I'm not gonna get banned.
[12:29.53]I'm not gonna say anything.
[12:31.21]Alright, let's go.
[12:32.37]What's next on the list of things to do?
[12:33.71]It's softcore porn.
[12:35.81]Okay.
[12:36.27]Well, you said the word porn.
[12:39.25]No, no, no, dude, don't worry, it's okay.
[12:40.51]It's softcore porn.
[12:43.13]It's, you said porn.
[12:47.03]Oh shit, is he gonna piss to me?
[12:51.19]Wait, because I bumped into him?
[13:01.62]Nice.
[13:11.71]You can skip it if you have to.
[13:12.83]Yeah, let me skip it.
[13:21.31]Violence good, boobies bad.
[13:23.25]Hey, I don't make the rules, alright?
[13:25.27]I just have to live by them.
[13:28.68]Yes, I know.
[13:29.56]I understand.
[13:30.32]I can gouge a guy's eyes out with a knife in a horror game and pull his eyes out and eat him and squish him.
[13:37.21]Blood will shoot out of the sides of my mouth.
[13:39.59]And then I can like throw that guy off a cliff and watch his body fucking roll and smash into rocks and his head smashes on the rock and the back of his head explodes.
[13:49.18]And then I climb down there like Gollum and I eat his brains and then shit on him.
[13:55.30]But if like a nipple shows up, I'm in trouble.
[13:58.24]I know.
[13:58.57]I get it.
[13:59.37]I understand.
[14:03.57]Look, I don't make the rules.
[14:06.97]Oh, wait.
[14:20.60]It's this guy again.
[14:21.26]I just walked around in a circle.
[14:29.49]What should I hand over?
[14:30.41]Oh, how about um... No, I don't want to give him my rare toys.
[14:35.91]I don't have a gun.
[14:40.01]Oh.
[14:41.29]Here.
[14:44.46]Oh, this looks really dangerous.
[14:46.40]What do you use this for?
[14:49.36]It's not dangerous at all.
[14:50.52]Everyone carries around that sort of thing.
[14:53.38]No, they don't.
[14:54.72]I'm beginning to suspect you might be a threat to public safety, Kira-san.
[14:58.36]Tell me what it's for.
[15:01.16]Uh, it's complicated.
[15:02.10]It has a very specific use.
[15:04.55]And what would that be?
[15:06.51]Uh, you know.
[15:07.71]It's a little embarrassing, so I didn't want to have to say it.
[15:09.75]It's actually for... Yes?
[15:15.95]What happened?
[15:16.47]What?
[15:16.75]What are they doing?
[15:20.51]I've never heard about that before.
[15:21.59]I guess I've led a sheltered life.
[15:23.27]What is that implying?
[15:26.39]I've used a gun?
[15:27.53]To...
[15:34.98]I still get the feeling you're not being completely honest with me.
[15:42.00]But you can go.
[15:42.68]Oh, we're not friends?
[15:44.99]Oh, no, we're not friends.
[15:48.11]Uh-oh.
[15:48.81]Alright, what am I supposed to be doing?
[15:52.43]I got to go to the store.
[15:53.83]I got to buy some stuff.
[15:54.61]Alright, let's go to the drugstore.
[16:02.52]Oh shit.
[16:06.16]I'm gonna go beast mode on this one.
[16:16.50]Was it grab for beast mode again?
[16:22.28]Holy shit.
[16:24.76]That was awesome.
[16:28.32]Do not under any circumstances play Mahjong.
[16:31.86]I'm going to, so.
[16:34.48]Unlike a lot of probably streamers that you've seen play this game, I know how to play Mahjong.
[16:37.60]I used to play it back in like 1996 on my old Windows 95 PC.
[16:44.70]I know how to play Mahjong.
[16:47.02]So, why would I not play it?
[16:49.73]Ooh, this gives me a health boost?
[16:55.75]I'll take it.
[17:00.76]It's a different Mahjong.
[17:04.93]What do you mean different?
[17:15.23]It's not the same Mahjong.
[17:17.11]What?
[17:19.84]It's different like Solitaire.
[17:20.90]Different to... What?
[17:23.06]Why would they do that?
[17:26.08]I don't know how to play Mahjong Classic.
[17:31.13]How do I progress the game?
[17:34.55]Can I pick him up off the ground?
[17:41.04]I can.
[17:41.82]What the fuck?
[17:44.02]I can pick him up by the legs?
[17:46.34]And I can do like a bam bam?
[17:56.77]Alright, if you see a guy walking at you with a bike, I think you turn around and run.
[17:59.85]Because regardless if this person is strong, it doesn't matter how tough this guy is, they are holding a bike in their hands in the air.
[18:13.18]Holy shit.
[18:21.04]Go back to the videos, you're a coward.
[18:23.87]Coward?
[18:25.18]COWARD!
[18:27.18]You think I'm a coward?
[18:30.88]What's, what's, what are we doing?
[18:31.88]What's, what's this, what's going on here?
[18:33.66]Wait.
[18:35.58]Uh, I like beast mode, but brawler's probably my favorite.
[18:39.06]Okay, I got four, three million.
[18:41.22]Okay, hold on.
[18:43.33]A mighty knee strike.
[18:44.53]Hold Y. Okay, that's cool.
[18:48.89]Max health, I'll take it, yeah.
[18:50.11]Max health.

[19:19.44]I don't even know where that was.
[19:29.64]Best automatically picks up beast picks up heavy items.
[19:34.58]In the bowling alley.
[19:37.03]Is it near the bowling alley?
[19:39.87]Is over here OK, I'll go to bowling alley.
[19:43.83]Yeah, I'm not opening any links for at least the next 30 to 40 minutes.
[19:50.08]Understand?
[19:56.35]No links for 30 to 40 minutes.
[19:59.17]Beast Mode is really fun, but it's like a big cleave.
[20:05.60]It's too slow though.
[20:22.62]Oh, it's back against the big bar.
[20:25.78]Oh my goodness.

[21:46.33]I only came here to see her.

[24:22.80]You know if I'm in the area.
[24:24.54]I'm going to show up with a bag of takeout with a bunch of food in my mouth.
[24:30.28]I was just at takeout down the street.
[24:32.36]I'm in the area.
[24:33.10]You want me to bring the bowl?
[24:42.90]Ooh, that was bad.
[24:51.57]She's trying.
[24:52.89]Yeah.
[24:53.17]No.
[24:53.49]Okay.
[24:54.11]Excuse me.
[24:54.65]Me and her.
[24:55.77]I've made it very clear that we're like trying.
[24:57.67]We're like want to talk to each other.
[24:58.89]Let her win.
[25:19.43]Should I?
[25:19.81]Alright, is it too obvious if I just do this?
[25:34.84]No, she'll think you're weak.
[25:45.78]She laughed, yeah.
[25:52.21]Stop saying simp.
[25:53.59]I didn't say simp.
[25:55.05]You did.
[25:55.73]Who is doing that?
[25:56.69]Stop saying that.
[26:09.86]God, she sucks.
[26:10.52]You have to crush her.
[26:11.72]No, I'm not going to just... I want it to be like fun.
[26:13.98]I just want to have fun.
[26:22.66]It's a close game.
[26:30.79]Oh, yeah.
[26:31.17]Let's go.
[26:47.50]I can't wait till she shows up at like my work with like a bag of Doritos with like the Doritos logo facing out.
[26:59.50]Sponsored.
[27:02.74]No.
[27:17.61]How would you be sponsored in, like, just in regular day-to-day?
[27:21.85]What?
[27:28.47]A sponsored date?
[27:38.11]I think at that point, why do I feel like some, like, quote, influencers do that?
[27:44.57]Oh, hey, I just want to make sure.
[27:45.57]Are you okay with that?
[27:46.25]This is a sponsored date.
[27:47.41]Like, are you okay with me having, like, you know, different, like, logos, all these different toys and stuff around the dinner table?
[27:56.54]I got sponsored by Hasbro.
[27:57.90]Like, I have to, like, always carry around the toys with me.
[28:03.50]Uh, do you have to do that here?
[28:05.02]Yeah, it's part of the contract.
[28:07.42]Even when there's no cameras on?
[28:09.40]Yeah.
[28:11.85]How will they know if you don't?
[28:17.38]Manly voice.
[28:18.46]My manly voice is like this.
[28:21.56]Okay.
[28:37.73]Should I start talking like this more often?
[28:39.41]I'm not going to look at chat, but what I want someone to do is I want them to count how many times the word STOP in all capitals has been spammed.
[28:56.15]I'm not going to keep track.
[28:57.05]I'm not going to look.
[29:00.65]I'm going to say two or three thousand times.
[29:03.35]Something like that.
[29:04.31]Whatever, I don't care.
[29:05.53]You think I care about that?
[29:06.47]No.
[29:06.93]Why would I even look?
[29:09.72]I don't care.
[29:16.60]And time.
[29:17.20]Okay, how many times was it said?
[29:18.38]Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh.

[30:39.43]I want to like make it so you can't write the word cuck on this stream for like an hour.
[30:46.80]So you'll be like, oh, whatever you say, cuck.

[31:56.13]Come on.
[31:57.77]Alright.
[31:58.61]And... You missed!
[32:04.92]Can I throw him up the stairs?
[32:07.60]No.
[32:07.90]Imagine getting thrown... Imagine going up the stairs instead of down the stairs.
[32:20.52]That would be worse than falling down the stairs.
[32:22.38]Hey there, buddy.
[32:25.02]Been looking for you.
[32:28.00]You again.
[32:29.14]Got a lot of nerve showing up now.
[32:30.98]What do you want?
[32:33.50]I think it's pretty clear what I want.
[32:35.14]Time to pay your protection money, pal.
[32:37.78]If you're doing business in Komurocho, you're doing business with us.
[32:42.30]To hell with that.
[32:43.02]It's not protection money if I don't show up to actually protect me when I need it.
[32:48.18]And you have the gall to ask me for more?
[32:51.90]When you need it?
[32:53.12]What are you talking about?
[32:55.28]I'm talking about Tachibana Real Estate.
[32:58.52]When they came and chased me out, you people were nowhere in sight.
[33:02.08]Some protection.
[33:04.63]Tachibana.
[33:06.49]What?
[33:07.47]Oh, Tachibana Real Estate.
[33:08.99]Yeah.
[33:09.98]They're, uh, look.
[33:11.64]It's complicated.
[33:13.20]Complicated my ass.
[33:15.28]You got scared and ran away.
[33:17.48]What could be simpler?
[33:19.60]Scared?
[33:20.78]What do you think?
[33:22.36]Thanks to you, I had to relocate.
[33:24.72]Now I'm scrambling to get new customers to make up for all these ones I lost.
[33:29.02]And pay you even if I wanted to.
[33:31.68]I think you better keep that attitude in check, asshole.
[33:35.08]Find if I cut in?
[33:36.16]Huh?
[33:39.30]What do you want?
[33:41.14]Who are you?
[33:42.30]What family you with?
[33:44.46]I'm not in anybody's family.
[33:46.50]Pipe down.
[33:47.68]It's this guy I'm talking to.
[33:49.42]So he said it's a four kids dub.
[33:57.09]Excuse me?
[34:00.47]What do you want from me?
[34:02.78]You say you up and shop here because Tachibana Real Estate forced you out at your last location.
[34:07.06]Is that right?
[34:09.58]Oh, I see what this is.
[34:11.30]You're trying to be this guy's new muscle.
[34:13.54]Oh, hell no.
[34:15.36]What?
[34:16.80]Our family's handled this cafe's protection for 30 years.
[34:19.92]You try to swoop in on our turf, it'll mean war.
[34:23.48]Look, looks like you might need some convincing to stay quiet while I speak to the owner here.
[34:30.57]Shut your mouth and try me.
[34:32.68]I'll kill you.
[34:35.88]Go Goku.
[34:39.02]Hey, rainbow.
[34:39.64]Thanks for the buy.
[34:40.44]I'll give you a dirty job.
[34:48.91]Ooh.
[34:49.09]God, you just got triple quadruple somersaulted.
[34:53.62]Saying words to make the YouTube video more funny.
[34:56.16]Saying words that are out of context to make the YouTube video funnier.
[35:00.26]You just got sla-ba-la-ba-ding-donged on your skull, Camarito.
[35:10.61]Say hello to the glass, ass.
[35:21.92]Let's do it again on his mouth.
[35:23.08]This time, hit him right in the mouth.
[35:26.90]You're my favorite YouTuber.
[35:28.02]Hey, thanks.
[35:28.56]I appreciate that.
[35:29.62]Thank you.
[35:30.22]I'm serious.
[35:41.15]Ned Flanders?
[35:44.23]What the hell?
[35:45.51]I'm not losing to some kid.
[35:48.87]You just did.
[35:50.33]Now get lost, and don't show your face around this guy's shop again.
[35:55.68]Damn it.
[35:56.56]This ain't over.
[35:57.44]Why do we all so- Why do we talk the same?
[36:00.18]Heh.
[36:00.92]Guy doesn't even realize... ...we all talk like this.
[36:05.12]Know what I mean?
[36:05.52]What the fuck is he talking about?
[36:07.04]We can finally talk in peace.
[36:09.88]So, uh, what in the end are you just talking?
[36:11.46]This place is you guys squeezing me for protection, huh?
[36:14.77]Too much CVT!
[36:52.29]Stop doing the H1... Z1 voice?
[37:02.14]Well, I'm doing the... I'm a... I'm like a character in a television show that's animated and full of people.
[37:11.28]Ask me for the play, kid.
[37:12.76]Hey, thanks for the five community subs.
[37:16.95]Appreciate it.
[37:19.38]You know, I haven't said that in probably seven years.
[37:22.70]PBS for kids animated voice.
[37:25.10]Well, let me pay attention.
[37:25.88]Stop it.
[37:26.18]Stop it.
[37:26.44]Stop it.
[37:26.70]Leave me alone.
[37:27.06]Leave me alone.
[37:29.24]Where would I go if I want to meet the guy from Tachibana's office who paid you that visit?
[37:34.70]Probably still there finishing what they started.
[37:37.22]Still where?
[37:38.20]Fuck.
[37:38.58]I'm still doing it.
[37:39.36]I'm sick though.
[37:40.26]It's my excuse to talk like this because I can do it today.
[37:43.09]I can't do it any other day because I'm not sick.
[37:46.75]Ooh, okay.
[37:49.12]They've driven most of the tenants out, so the place is practically empty.
[37:56.75]And he's still there.
[37:58.27]Probably.
[37:59.07]They're making him all kinds of sweet deals, but he turned down every last one.
[38:01.75]If he's still there now, Tachibana's boys will be too.
[38:05.91]Go have a look.
[38:07.11]If you really want to get mixed up with him.
[38:09.71]Okay, thanks.
[38:10.45]Appreciate it.
[38:11.99]Tachibana's been running tenants out of the Hakua building on Shichifuku Street.
[38:16.24]It's worth checking out.
[38:18.52]Thanks for the info.
[38:21.73]I just turned.
[38:22.31]I turned not paying attention.
[38:23.49]Just turned and just... And hit my head square into this thing.
[38:27.53]And fall flat on my back in a coma for the rest of the game.
[38:48.33]I've literally done that.
[38:49.11]I have too.
[38:51.21]How many times have you guys in your own house somehow taken a corner too sharply and just your shoulder just smashes into the corner like of the doorway?
[39:05.30]Yeah, it happens.
[39:07.58]It sucks.
[39:09.32]But then you get really annoyed with yourself because you're like, I live here.
[39:14.52]How do I not know how to do these corners correctly?
[39:23.90]God.
[39:24.98]Car door, car door, car door.
[39:26.18]Alright, come here.
[39:37.13]Car door.
[39:38.53]Beast car door.
[39:39.35]Alright, let him go.
[39:52.59]Fucking god, come on dude.
[39:58.13]I got like stuck on the... Whatever.
[40:04.28]I grabbed him over here and I couldn't like push him back and then he got away and then like my controller got like locked.
[40:20.08]This is a game where you get, like, stuck on stuff.
[40:23.93]Notice that.
[40:24.41]It's very, like, clingy.
[40:42.86]Okay, here we go.
[40:43.36]Do I have sticky keys?
[40:48.64]No.
[40:48.85]What if I need them?
[40:57.03]Here we go.
[41:05.21]I can like- I can mute the microphone and cough for like 10 minutes straight.
[41:08.12]I'll be right back.
[41:22.01]Okay, hi.
[41:35.41]Okay, who's in here?
[41:38.57]Make it some story.
[41:39.23]I run the place.
[41:43.31]Wait, is this the bathroom?
[41:44.23]Why is he like opening the door like he's sitting on the toilet?
[41:47.75]Like, get out of here!
[42:05.83]I'll drive you out of the building, okay?
[42:08.71]I'll take care of that.
[42:26.87]What is this?
[42:29.65]What's going on here?
[42:30.99]Ow.
[42:31.13]I don't even know why I'm laughing.
[42:32.95]It doesn't make any sense.
[42:35.49]Got your phone?
[42:36.15]I'm not on my phone.
[42:36.79]Hmm.
[42:55.66]I don't want to rate Twitter.
[43:00.64]Like, I don't want to rate the app.
[43:01.96]Like, fuck off.
[43:03.08]It's been like seven years since I've owned this.
[43:10.38]If I haven't done it yet, I'm not going to.
[43:23.95]Scream and shout and piss in the halls.
[43:25.09]Put the phone down to stream.
[43:25.97]Yes, I just did.
[43:26.49]Just had to check my notifications, man.
[43:28.17]Oh, I can't wait to drag somebody's head across that bar.
[43:55.26]I don't know.
[43:56.46]Hahaha.
[44:19.79]he just opened that like there was a bee in his room he's just like just open the door and run eventually maybe he'll leave um
[44:45.67]You're my hair?
[44:47.89]Not anymore.
[44:49.41]It is though.
[44:49.81]It really is.
[44:50.19]It's like the exact same haircut I had like a year ago.
[45:13.93]Oh, shit.
[45:14.19]This...
[45:43.27]How much is that?
[45:44.53]Is that a lot?
[45:45.33]Oh shit, he's giving it back!
[46:13.02]Oh, shit.
[46:13.32]That's another two million.
[46:15.26]It's like Oprah.
[46:16.02]He's just going to be like, are we going to get cars too?
[46:20.06]Money is not the problem.
[46:40.20]It's the money that you lost at baseball.
[46:42.37]Wait, was it a debate?
[46:44.23]Huh?
[47:11.80]It was Monopoly money.
[47:13.92]Wasn't even real.
[47:14.60]What is it?
[47:15.00]Can't you hear that cry?
[47:22.19]In front of the child.
[47:39.25]I have $20 million in brawler.
[47:40.25]What are you, a rush guy?
[47:41.33]Looks like it.
[47:41.67]He pushes me really fucking hard.
[47:44.37]Namase-san.
[48:07.22]I think I'll be able to get a phone call around tonight.
[48:11.64]Russia's OP is fucked.
[48:14.01]So I picked the wrong one.
[48:15.13]It's dangerous to have a strange sense of justice in a town like this, brother.
[48:28.69]You have to be careful with the wasabi.
[48:46.51]Sorry, I laughed when he left.
[48:50.11]Beast mode?
[48:52.35]But I like brawler mode.
[48:55.16]Oh shit, this is ugly.
[49:23.00]Hold on.
[49:23.74]Guys, hold on.
[49:24.36]I play in the bathtub.
[49:25.20]I was just rinsing my hair.
[49:28.34]I've had the conditioner in for the last 51 minutes.
[49:30.36]There we are.
[49:30.90]Juggles.
[49:32.26]I've just shaken up a drink.
[49:34.02]I have a little drink here.
[49:35.21]I have like a little... I need to... I don't know.
[49:39.01]Whatever.
[49:39.41]Don't... Leave me alone.
[49:40.95]Watch the game.
[49:41.43]I'm coughing.
[49:53.92]Okay.
[49:54.06]Stop trying to be cool.

[50:27.48]I just like shook of a drink and got like embarrassed that you heard it.
[50:33.55]True.
[50:33.97]Let me pay attention.
[50:36.53]Hold on.
[50:36.81]Leave me alone.
[50:37.85]You're gonna be in big trouble.
[50:39.25]All of you.
[50:39.77]I see.
[51:01.57]Close chat during kai canon.
[51:26.56]I read what somebody said.
[51:30.04]Okay, real estate company willing to make an enemy of the
[51:45.18]of the Tojo clan.
[51:46.86]The owner of Cafe Blend may have been right about them being worse than the Yakuza.
[51:49.91]I want a bit more info.
[51:51.41]Hopefully I can track down those other homeless guys.
[51:54.35]In this neighborhood, I usually see them hanging around Park Boulevard.
[51:57.59]Maybe I'll start there.
[51:58.39]Find the homeless men.
[52:06.02]Flat on back.
[52:16.04]Old material?
[52:17.33]It was like 20 minutes ago.
[52:19.77]It's not old material if it happens in the same stream.
[52:22.89]It's a closed environment here.
[52:24.53]Give me this.
[52:33.42]Nice.
[52:36.80]Heat mode.
[52:39.69]Fuck, that happened so quickly.
[52:41.09]I don't even know what's gonna happen.
[52:50.16]Use the railing.
[52:50.78]Alright, let's go.
[52:51.66]Come here.
[52:57.68]Did it work?
[53:01.22]Get up.
[53:03.64]Come here.
[53:10.99]Get up.
[53:12.85]Use the corner of the railing.

[53:27.34]He's crazy strong.
[53:28.64]I am.
[53:29.00]Hey, I have to ask you guys a couple of questions.
[53:45.91]Hmm.
[53:50.75]If I did, I'd be doing them myself.
[53:53.99]Speaking of, I hear Saku-san just got back from that gig for Tachibana Real Estate.
[53:59.11]You serious?
[53:59.83]Lucky bastard.
[54:00.54]You think he'd cut me in on some of that if I asked him?
[54:03.52]Who knows?
[54:03.92]Can't hurt to ask.
[54:05.04]I guess he's probably over at Public Park 3 with his buddies.
[54:12.56]I just have like a funnel in my ear leaning.
[54:18.45]Hmm.
[54:27.02]Stop eating spaghetti in the bathtub.

[54:55.17]You're too close to the fight.
[54:58.24]You eat spaghetti in the bathtub.
[55:12.87]I don't.
[55:15.10]I feel like that's like a weird YouTube video you watched where it was like, I made a bathtub with spaghetti sauce and like ate spaghetti in the bathtub with the tomato sauce or something.
[55:28.12]Oh, not this guy again.
[55:29.66]No.

[55:40.29]I made a video where it like... I made a video where I sat on a gun in the bath.
[55:43.67]Different.
[55:47.21]This is about as safe as it gets.
[55:49.29]It doesn't look like you're carrying anything dangerous.
[55:56.15]And the bathtub when I have like the TF2 video.

[56:49.00]What did he hit his head on?
[56:54.60]I just unplugged that guy from his internet.
[56:57.83]Somebody pulled the ethernet cable out when he ran at me.

[73:58.33]I shouldn't have let that show.
[74:01.13]But you're right.
[74:01.59]Something's been on my mind all day.
[74:03.03]What's that?
[74:05.47]The head office gave me an assignment of sorts.
[74:08.24]An assignment, huh?
[74:09.84]We have lots of competition here from the M store chain and others.
[74:13.42]Our stores are all very similar, don't you think?
[74:16.08]But think of it.
[74:16.50]I guess there's not much of a difference between your store.
[74:20.43]That's why the head office asked employees from various branches to come up with ideas that would set Poppo stores apart from others.
[74:28.09]That's why you're lost in thought.
[74:29.23]Okay.
[74:30.35]Hmm.
[74:31.03]I don't want to suggest something random that would only grab the customer's attention for five minutes.
[74:42.88]Silly me.
[74:43.46]I should ask customers for their opinions.
[74:44.82]Do you have a few minutes?
[74:45.48]Of course I do.
[74:51.14]Great.
[74:51.38]So, Kirusan, is there something... Is there anything that you would... God damn it.
[75:02.38]Is there anything that you would like our store to introduce?
[75:07.16]Let me think.
[75:08.28]What would I want at a convenience store?
[75:10.58]I would want... Sofas.
[75:16.75]Luxury brand goods.
[75:18.65]Also delivery service.
[75:19.55]How about delivery?
[75:22.33]That would be pretty good, right?
[75:23.93]Let's do delivery.
[75:26.88]If stores all across Japan, you could use that to offer a delivery service.
[75:32.07]Oh my gosh, that's a good idea.
[75:33.79]Why go to the post office or arrange a courier if you could mail or pick up parcels at the same store you do your shopping in?
[75:39.67]Oh, I got it wrong.
[75:40.36]I thought they were going to be delivering food and like sprites and stuff to people, not like actually do like mail.
[75:45.72]Like handle mail?
[75:46.60]Okay.
[75:50.56]It still worked.
[75:52.56]You could also offer a range of discounts to further entice the customers.
[75:57.00]Your idea is going to be a winner.
[75:58.08]You must be a business genius.
[75:59.38]What?
[76:02.70]Okay.
[76:03.28]Alright.
[76:10.74]Friendship ended with bowling girl.
[76:13.29]Now store girl is my best friend.
[76:25.40]Good one.
[76:29.82]Oh, more friendship.
[76:31.16]Friendship.
[76:32.10]Friendship.
[76:33.08]Again.
[76:33.42]I need to buy the whiskey.
[76:38.68]Almost there.
[76:40.94]Oh.
[76:56.83]I shared your suggestions about offering a parcel delivery service with that office, and they jumped on the idea!
[77:02.63]I even got a raise thanks to that!
[77:04.17]Hey, that's great!
[77:06.83]But it was your idea to begin with, so I owe you a big thank you!
[77:09.63]I got you this, hope you'll like it!
[77:12.38]You got a Berserker charm.
[77:15.24]Oh shit.
[77:19.84]This is gonna be a new hot snack here available soon, nice!
[77:24.06]Yeah, congratulations.
[77:25.32]We're starting to sell this today.
[77:26.26]Can you guess what it is?
[77:26.92]Let me give you a hint.
[77:28.39]It's delicious by itself or with soy sauce or mustard.
[77:31.71]It's a specialty from the Nagoya area.
[77:33.99]Goes well with soy sauce and mustard.
[77:37.21]It must be... Hot miso soup.
[77:42.79]Steamed pork buns.
[77:49.96]Goes well with soy sauce and mustard.
[77:51.42]That's steamed pork buns.
[77:52.34]It has to be.
[77:56.30]Wait, is it cutlets?
[77:58.18]Miso cut... Wait.
[77:59.34]Miso cutlets with pork buns.
[78:00.74]Probably pork, right?
[78:01.66]Mustard?
[78:02.00]Pork and mustard.
[78:09.17]They go together really well.
[78:10.07]Did I just get a DansGame for saying pork and mustard?
[78:19.69]It's cutlets.
[78:21.25]Dude, it's... No, it's not.
[78:22.21]It's another... No, no.
[78:23.39]Cutlets?
[78:24.99]Cutlets?
[78:28.17]It's literally cutlets.
[78:34.06]They go together great.
[78:35.42]Don't listen to chat.
[78:36.36]Yeah, I know.
[78:36.94]What's going on here?
[78:38.84]Cutlets is the right answer.
[78:40.00]If you get wrong, I'm going to be pissed off the rest of the stream.
[78:46.08]Bingo.
[78:47.41]So starting today, we'll be selling yummy miso cutlets.
[78:52.25]Yay.
[78:54.49]Gabby J. Yay.

[79:18.46]Can't wait to try one.
[79:20.26]I really like them too.
[79:25.68]And the reward for guessing correctly is our brand new miso cutlet lunch set.
[79:32.13]Ooh.
[79:33.25]And it's only a two star.
[79:35.75]Gross.
[79:43.34]yeah you give me too much credit besides look at you you become a model employee and you're excellent at customer service as well hmm you think so well I guess I'm not as nervous around customers anymore not only that but the head office likes your ideas too who knows you could be the manager of this store soon oh no way I have so much more to learn before I can even start thinking about that
[80:11.21]But if I am getting better at my job, I have to thank you for that.
[80:16.57]How so?
[80:18.39]You were so scary looking.
[80:20.09]Hold on.
[80:20.45]You were so scary looking that I was terrified of you at first.
[80:24.62]But we managed to become friends.
[80:26.38]Since then, I don't get jittery around other people anymore.
[80:29.02]I'm pretty good at doing that shit.
[80:38.60]Only friends?
[80:39.63]Yeah, whatever.
[80:43.97]I'm not that scary, am I?
[80:45.21]Well, hee-hee.

[81:02.64]Ooh!
[81:06.72]Oh!
[81:22.22]Hey, it's me again.
[81:22.94]I'm here to buy things to make you happy.
[81:29.28]I can't carry it.
[81:33.20]I have a backpack and two duffel bags.
[81:36.72]And grocery bags on both arms.
[81:38.84]And I'm just stumbling in here.
[81:40.73]Hey.
[81:41.65]Hey, um... I, uh... Can I... I'll take a... I'll take, like, a couple of Slim Jims.
[81:48.55]Can you just put them in my mouth?
[81:49.95]I'll open in my mouth.
[81:56.02]God damn it.
[81:56.50]Alright, I'll be back.
[82:08.27]Gotta, gotta relieve myself of stuff so I can go back in there and buy stuff to make that girl happy.
[82:12.71]Here, take this.
[82:18.99]Here, take your beer.
[82:22.64]Oh, perfect.
[82:24.75]You're a decent guy for a kid your age.
[82:26.83]Kid, what?
[82:28.19]How old am I?
[82:31.39]How old is Kiryu?
[82:37.78]20?
[82:38.10]He's 20 years old.
[82:41.78]Damn.
[82:42.16]Alright, what did you want?
[82:44.08]No, not you.
[82:49.72]What should I hand over?
[82:50.46]Here's the sweet potato soju.
[82:51.94]Enjoy it.
[82:53.18]How the fuck am I as old as Kiryu?
[83:00.95]I don't know.
[83:05.33]You get the wrong attitude, kid.
[83:08.06]When an elder offers you a drink, you drink it.
[83:10.84]Doesn't matter if you're a featherweight.
[83:12.20]That's the rule, so you want to get ahead.
[83:13.72]Back when I was a businessman...
[83:18.52]Oh, whatever.
[83:20.54]You wanted the scotch, right?
[83:23.84]I'm really particular about my whiskey.
[83:26.09]Oh, I didn't get scotch?
[83:27.99]That was just regular whiskey?
[83:29.23]Oh, shit.
[83:31.83]You want... I have something else.
[83:34.41]Sake, right?
[83:36.75]Alright, I don't have it.
[83:37.59]Alright, where can I get it?
[83:41.51]This is... Uh...
[83:45.42]Here's the drink place.
[83:46.88]Beef bowl restaurant.
[83:48.66]Bowl.
[83:49.04]Bowling.
[83:49.88]Bowl.
[83:50.16]Is there somebody in there I can talk to?
[83:51.46]Poppo.
[83:57.23]Don.
[83:57.49]There we go.
[83:57.87]Don Kiyoto.
[83:58.43]Alright.
[83:58.65]We're going to bang a right and then a right.
[84:00.19]Uh-oh.
[84:01.93]We got Yakuza.
[84:17.07]Did I say Kiyotio?
[84:17.97]Kiyoti?
[84:18.43]Kiyotio?
[84:21.29]Kiyotio?
[84:21.81]What are you saying?
[84:26.64]Kiyoti?
[84:27.20]Kihoto?
[84:28.98]Kihote?
[84:33.56]Kihotio?
[84:38.56]Kiyoto?
[84:39.50]Kioxio?
[84:40.57]What?
[84:42.33]That's Spanish.
[84:43.27]What?
[84:46.26]What do you mean that's Spanish?
[84:55.15]Don Quijoto?
[85:02.43]It's not Spanish?
[85:11.84]Oh, it is.
[85:13.61]Don Quixote.
[85:17.41]Don Quixote.
[85:19.57]The plot revolves around the adventures of a noble from La Mancha named Alsano Quisano, who reads so many chivalry romances that he loses his mind and becomes a knight.
[85:37.17]It's like literature.
[85:44.92]Okay, let's play the video game.
[85:46.31]Shut up!
[85:49.39]NA education.
[85:50.17]I haven't been in a school desk in 20 fucking years.
[85:54.27]Give me a break.
[85:59.94]Into the truck.
[86:03.20]Wait, beast mode.
[86:09.64]Beast mode.
[86:10.02]Can I pick up the truck in beast mode?
[86:11.20]Ow.
[86:18.32]Oh, nice.
[86:20.20]He dropped out at 15.
[86:21.48]No, you don't... No, I didn't.
[86:33.15]I'm just saying, it's been a while.
[86:36.99]What's going on here?
[86:39.71]Oh, shit.
[86:40.23]All these people are waiting for smiles.
[86:46.02]Look, I'm just gonna- I'm gonna just walk by all these people, starting at the bottom, with a huge, toothy smile, and just walk backwards, looking at everybody directly in their eyes.
[86:55.41]And go, thank you!
[86:56.75]Thank you, goodbye, all of you!
[86:58.21]Goodbye, thank you!
[86:58.99]And then get right in front of them.
[87:01.39]Get in the- Right- Get to the front of the fucking line.
[87:04.89]What's up, man?
[87:15.94]I snuck off from work for this.
[87:17.02]If my manager finds out before I get back, I'm so dead.
[87:23.50]Hey, kid.
[87:25.48]Huh?
[87:26.02]Yes?
[87:27.93]What's going on?
[87:28.43]Why are all these people here?
[87:30.73]Did you want one?
[87:31.49]Two?
[87:32.57]I'm really sorry, but they said I'll get the last one in stock.
[87:36.91]What are you talking about?
[87:40.21]Aren't you lining up for an Aura Q3?
[87:44.38]OraQ 3, is that some kind of secret code?
[87:47.94]Nah, it's an OraQ 3.
[87:52.65]The newest game in the OraQ series.
[87:55.81]OraQ 3, short for OraQ 3 Quest for the Quantum Quill.
[87:59.49]I can't wait to read the instruction manual on my way home.
[88:01.79]Hmm, never heard of it.
[88:05.21]People are actually lining up to buy a video game.
[88:07.19]What an amazing world we live in.
[88:09.96]Yeah, it's the most popular game in Japan right now.
[88:12.39]I went looking for it with Papa.
[88:14.29]They were sold out everywhere.
[88:17.37]Then my friend told me this place was getting a new batch today.
[88:19.61]So I grabbed my allowance and ran all the way here.
[88:22.46]They got any 3080s in there?
[88:25.60]I made it just in time and got the last reservation ticket.
[88:28.12]I'm so happy.
[88:28.84]It's going to be the best game ever made.
[88:30.16]Times are strange if it's this hard to buy a toy.
[88:38.05]Sorry to bug you, kid.
[88:39.25]Thanks for the info.
[88:42.87]Yep, bye mister.
[88:49.52]I snuck off from work.
[88:50.84]Yeah, we already talked to you.
[88:55.01]No cutting in line, pal.
[88:56.33]You have to play by the rules and get in the back like everyone else.
[89:05.58]I'm so glad I lined up first thing this morning.
[89:07.86]I'm going to be the first one to get it.
[89:15.14]I just went in.
[89:15.70]Wait, does this mean we don't know this door is open?
[89:24.20]I'll take a... or a Q3, please.
[89:35.52]Oh, damn it.
[89:36.18]I can't just buy one.
[89:39.66]Tires.
[89:42.92]Comfy souls.
[89:45.68]Yeah.

[90:04.11]Protective amulet.
[90:06.50]Baseball shirt.

[90:53.08]Oh, dude.
[90:53.52]Force strength, force stamp, leather belt.
[90:55.94]Okay.
[90:57.86]Just regular champagne, right?
[91:01.12]Is it a really old meme?
[91:02.33]Yeah.
[91:03.17]Sorry, I was on the internet like fucking 15 years ago.
[91:06.23]It's gotta be gold?
[91:07.63]That's too much money!
[91:08.43]Zoomers don't get it.
[91:09.97]Awww.
[91:10.15]Oh dude, zoomers don't get it.
[91:33.58]vintage what else can I do here wait should I get the mountain dew oh enjoying her nice mountain dew didn't we have a whole entire stream where I got like the mandela effect where like I said Tom green did that and he did we couldn't find it or something

[92:02.08]Why these these are in the game?
[92:03.56]The actual brands?
[92:05.26]That's kind of weird.
[92:09.99]Why that?
[92:14.15]Mountain Dew Mountain Dew.
[92:15.59]There's a ton of brands in the Yakuza games.
[92:22.67]How do they do that without getting in trouble?
[92:30.37]Alright, this is where I go, hey, do you guys sell cardboard boxes here?
[92:33.43]Uh, yeah.
[92:36.01]Can I get like a couple of cardboard boxes, like two or three cardboard boxes, just kind of like large squares?
[92:40.17]And they're like, I guess.
[92:42.51]I mean, that'll be like three dollars.
[92:44.07]Thank you, thank you.
[92:45.57]And I buy the cardboard boxes and I just kind of get them up from holding empty cardboard boxes.
[92:51.91]And I open the door to leave the store here and I go like this.
[92:59.43]I start, like, kind of running.
[93:01.01]I got them all, dickheads!
[93:03.28]Just run by the line.
[93:10.00]Hmm, is that... Game over, loser.
[93:14.28]What?
[93:17.64]Hey, the kid that was lining up for the game, right?
[93:21.60]Did you manage to get it?
[93:23.74]Oh, mister.
[93:25.60]What's the matter?
[93:27.65]It's my brand new video game.
[93:29.07]That guy stole it.
[93:31.77]What?
[93:33.07]You mean that high school kid just stole it?
[93:37.39]He just ran up and yelled at me to hand it over.
[93:39.75]He took my Ara Q3.
[93:42.53]I spent all morning waiting in line, too.
[93:45.09]I saved up my allowance for a really, really long time to get it.
[93:47.63]You steal from a kid.
[93:49.35]You deserve the strongest punishment.
[93:52.45]I'll get it.
[93:52.85]I'm gonna go get it.
[93:55.61]Here, kid, I'm gonna go get that, but I can't promise that I won't smash it over his head.
[94:01.40]I'm gonna be in beast mode, so it's gonna be hard for me to control my emotions.
[94:05.22]But I will get revenge for you, I promise.
[94:11.48]Hey, kid, what's your name?
[94:15.41]It's, it's Akio.
[94:20.27]Fuck you.
[94:20.67]Got it.
[94:21.51]Hang tight.
[94:22.41]I'll get your game back.
[94:24.51]You will?
[94:26.21]So there's no need to cry.
[94:28.19]Mister, okay.
[94:28.91]I won't cry anymore.
[94:31.43]Good.
[94:31.67]That's showing some spine, little man.
[94:33.21]I like that.
[94:34.44]Leave it to me.
[94:36.28]Yay.
[94:37.28]Thank you, mister.
[94:38.02]That high school delin... Whoa, he's in high school?
[94:42.52]Oh, um... Right.
[94:45.02]No, I'm not going to smash it over his... Forget everything I just said.
[94:56.04]Alright, where is he?
[95:03.80]You give that back, right now.
[95:07.40]Hmm, isn't that... Later, freak!
[95:10.77]Wait, did he just steal it from the high school kid?
[95:12.87]They're just playing, like, steal the PlayStation 5 tag?
[95:22.67]No fair.
[95:24.69]That's the kid who took Akio's game.
[95:26.49]Hey, you have that game, don't you?
[95:31.11]Huh?
[95:33.49]What's it to you?
[95:34.26]My adventure just came to an abrupt end, so leave me alone.
[95:38.34]No can do.
[95:38.78]I'll take back that Arakuro you took from Akio.
[95:43.24]Ara Q3?
[95:43.66]That's the last thing I want to hear about right now.
[95:45.62]Forget it.
[95:46.08]I'm going to grind your ass just for the experience.
[95:51.48]What?
[96:02.93]Okay, I gotta trashcan him in the headset.
[96:05.69]Alright, get the fuck over here, dude.
[96:11.30]Put his head in the trashcan.
[96:20.52]All this over a video game.
[96:24.41]Wait, is that- isn't this kid in high school?
[96:27.89]What the hell am I doing?
[96:32.32]Mister!
[96:36.52]That run was... I just caught the guy who took our Acura.
[96:42.45]Oh, yay!
[96:44.69]Okay, give Acura his Acura back.
[96:47.83]Look, man.
[96:48.27]I don't have it.
[96:49.63]Give it up already.
[96:50.61]If you don't want another beating, hand it over and get a job next time you want a video game.
[96:55.36]I told you I don't have it.
[96:56.28]I got robbed by a better thief than me.
[97:00.98]You were robbed too?
[97:03.14]Yeah, this jerk from a street gang busted out his dagger of stealing and made me give it to him.
[97:08.49]Hmm.
[97:09.63]Oh, a dagger.
[97:11.19]Force strength.
[97:11.99]Force stamp.
[97:12.63]Dagger of healing.
[97:14.23]Aw.
[97:14.95]Uh.
[97:15.57]Uh.
[97:18.74]Dagger of stealing?
[97:20.24]I mean.
[97:20.56]Ah.
[97:25.22]Yeah, lame.
[97:25.94]I could be leveling up, but my ARA Q3 is probably going to be some dudes not even a fan of the Q3.
[97:33.49]A dagger of healing.
[97:36.51]No, no, trust me, trust me.
[97:37.65]When I stab you with this dagger in the stomach, you're going to fail.
[97:41.04]Your diarrhea is going to go away tomorrow morning.
[97:43.36]I promise.
[97:49.33]That wasn't yours.
[97:51.35]Huh?
[97:52.51]You rob a little kid and then turn around and cry like a baby when you get mugged?
[97:55.56]How pathetic is that?
[97:56.54]You haven't learned your lesson yet, you funk.
[98:04.02]No!
[98:04.58]I'm already out of lives!
[98:06.20]Sorry, man.
[98:06.83]I'm out of here.
[98:08.27]Didn't I just kick this guy's head into the wall as hard as I could?
[98:13.29]Being able to make, like, jokey video game references after all of your teeth are gone, and you need, like, four hours of surgery to fix your skull, like, I mean, that's... I mean, come on.
[98:23.10]What's going on here?
[98:24.02]Alright, I'll get it back.
[98:35.14]The kid just stole.
[98:36.58]And stole it by some other stole somebody.
[98:39.07]And that guy went off this way.
[98:43.07]I swear to God, if this guy gets robbed... Oh my God.
[98:47.31]Oh my God, okay.
[98:48.94]Oi.
[99:12.53]Hey, you're the guy that stole the PlayStation from the kid that stole it from Accio.
[99:18.43]Who the hell is Accio?
[99:19.53]And what if they did?
[99:20.43]I saw my chance and I took it.
[99:23.89]No, you robbed the kid who robbed Accio of his Arakura.
[99:28.37]I don't get it.
[99:29.67]Forget it.
[99:30.31]Just give back the Arakura cartridge you stole.
[99:34.21]Arak-Q3?
[99:35.07]Arak-Q3?
[99:35.67]I don't want to hear another word about Arak-Q3.
[99:37.87]I'm gonna stomp you.
[99:50.32]Oh, nice.
[99:51.08]Pick him up by his legs and smash his head somewhere.
[99:55.86]Oops.
[100:01.21]Oh, fuck.
[100:01.87]I pressed the wrong button.
[100:24.66]Oh, I got a scratch on my arm.
[100:31.44]Who's that lady that walked on stage?
[100:33.49]And she had like the arms that came out.
[100:34.67]She like did that walk.
[100:35.67]It's a meme.
[100:38.63]The politician.
[100:44.13]Some EU politician.
[100:46.00]Theresa May.
[100:46.48]Yeah.
[100:46.76]Alright.
[100:48.00]He's doing like the Theresa May walk.
[100:56.62]Alright, give the Akira.
[101:00.82]Sorry, pal, but your game got pinched.
[101:03.92]I'm not playing around.
[101:04.97]Give the kid his game or you can suffer.
[101:08.41]Me.
[101:08.83]Suffer me now.
[101:10.07]I'm serious.
[101:10.75]It's really gone.
[101:11.41]Some a-hole got the jump on me.
[101:13.81]You carry around a knife.
[101:15.19]You rob kids and stuff.
[101:17.22]And you stab people, but you won't say asshole.
[101:20.90]But you'll kill people.
[101:23.78]Hmm.
[101:25.33]Remember how we talked about earlier?
[101:28.70]You can gouge somebody's eyes out with a fucking stick.
[101:31.88]But like saying the word fuck on TV.
[101:34.94]We're seeing it.
[101:35.32]It's coming full circle.
[101:43.90]Professionals have standards.
[101:45.34]Remember your nephews are watching.
[101:51.11]What?
[101:51.31]My nephew's not watching Yakuza.
[101:55.93]This hard-ass held me up at gunpoint.
[101:59.65]Hmm.
[102:00.21]That guy that was just here?
[102:04.28]What a shitty day.
[102:05.76]That guy jacked my RQ-3.
[102:07.22]That wasn't yours.
[102:10.28]You steal from a kid then cry like a baby when you get mugged.
[102:12.44]I'm seeing a pathetic pattern here.
[102:13.62]If this isn't getting through to you, how about we go another round?
[102:18.96]Wah!
[102:19.86]No, nope.
[102:20.66]I'm good.
[102:21.14]I'm sorry.
[102:23.52]My RQ-3!
[102:26.17]don't worry I promise I'll hunt it down at this point at this point I'm gonna be like son just give me one second do you ever heard of eBay here I'll get one for you which what's your address well the thug who took akio's era q3 from the kid who stole it in the first place ended up having it taken by some hard-ass Yakuza who went up towards the tahi boulevard
[102:58.15]Let's go.
[103:02.75]It's 1988.
[103:03.07]Oh.
[103:03.35]Internet didn't exist.
[103:12.34]I would just go buy one.
[103:15.04]I would just... Okay, here's what I would do.
[103:16.92]Yeah, sure, eBay didn't exist.
[103:18.66]I would stand on the corner, like right here, wherever that game store was, and I would just go, ladies and gentlemen, may I have your attention for one moment?
[103:29.12]If anyone has recently purchased the AraQ3 system, I am willing to pay 20% more than what you paid for it.
[103:40.24]I currently have $500 cash in my pocket, and I'll do it.
[103:44.42]We will do a transaction right now.
[103:47.46]Spread the word.
[103:48.20]I'll be here every afternoon from 2 p.m.
[103:51.04]to 4 p.m.
[103:52.14]Pacific.
[103:53.72]And I would just go and wait until somebody showed up.
[103:57.32]We get robbed.
[103:59.19]Oh, yeah?
[103:59.61]What about that one here?
[104:00.77]Yeah, you gonna come rob me?
[104:02.19]Oh, excuse me.
[104:08.26]Where is this guy?
[104:12.68]Sold out.
[104:13.14]Yeah, that's why I be announcing it on the corner.
[104:18.36]If you're more comfortable with getting a check, I have those too.
[104:24.04]You're finally mine.
[104:24.74]Hour Q3.
[104:25.28]My quest is complete.
[104:28.40]A game you got there.
[104:31.52]You stole it.
[104:37.07]Oh, you see, this Arakyura belongs to us.
[104:39.17]Bwahaha.
[104:40.67]So if you want to live, get off my street.
[104:43.31]And listen, don't bother looking for a place that's still selling Arakyu 3.
[104:46.87]Just find a fool who bought one and take it.
[104:50.29]Villains.
[104:51.23]Every last one.
[104:52.01]What's this world coming to?
[104:55.82]Bah!
[104:57.28]What'd you say, boy?
[104:58.48]That Arakure, I'm taking it from you.
[105:02.92]What's that?
[105:03.46]Take it back.
[105:04.24]So, listen up, boy.
[105:05.26]A pornography starring your mother.
[105:08.46]Don't act like it was your game to start with.
[105:10.52]Huh?
[105:12.04]Shut up, it's complicated.
[105:15.06]I see, you're an Ara-Q-3 Hunter 2, then.
[105:17.60]Playtime is over.
[105:18.38]I'm not holding back.
[105:19.24]And he has a gun.
[105:20.72]He just aims it up, excuse me, right in the forehead.
[105:25.20]Can he kill me?
[105:32.42]Don't even let him shoot it.
[105:46.45]Why is he hitting me?
[105:47.73]You have a gun.
[105:57.60]He's using it as a melee weapon.
[106:02.20]This cannot be.
[106:03.12]I will be taking that RQ3 with me.
[106:07.39]Hold on, please.
[106:08.51]I need that.
[106:09.61]Give it back.
[106:10.23]Come on.
[106:10.63]Give it back?
[106:12.21]This was never yours to begin with.
[106:14.49]Fella, I'm begging you, please.
[106:15.65]My little boy's been really looking forward to playing it.
[106:19.25]Your son?
[106:19.83]Uh, yeah.
[106:21.55]My old lady left me and took the boy with her.
[106:24.15]He's been wanting RQ3.
[106:25.89]Wait a minute.
[106:26.33]Is this the...
[106:28.57]Is this the kid's dad?
[106:34.67]We went looking everywhere, but there ain't none for sale anywhere.
[106:37.31]I just wanted my boy to be happy.
[106:39.25]I'm begging you.
[106:40.49]You gotta let me have it, please.
[106:43.97]I can't do that.
[106:44.63]You probably don't know this, but a little kid saved up his allowance and went through a lot of trouble to buy the last one.
[106:49.21]Huh?
[106:52.27]I didn't stick up a little kid.
[106:53.45]I just took it off some worthless goon.
[106:56.48]That's right, you got the game from a punk.
[106:58.36]But that game belonged to a little kid first.
[107:00.66]Long story short, you took our Q3 from a wannabe punk, who took it from a high school bully, who took it from the last boy in line who bought it in the first place.
[107:08.55]My head hurts just thinking about it, but alright, so that's what happened.
[107:13.71]And I came to get it back for the little kid.
[107:15.49]It's going back to the rightful owner.
[107:18.88]I'm sorry.
[107:20.94]It's going to be the kid's dad.
[107:23.04]Fella, I'm the fool here.
[107:25.04]Give it back to that kid for me.
[107:27.64]Damn, I was about to make someone's kid cry for the sake of my own.
[107:30.90]What kind of monster have I become?
[107:35.20]I thought I could make my boy happy with something I stole from someone else.
[107:39.18]I was wrong.
[107:39.56]How am I supposed to be a good dad to my boy?
[107:43.12]Do Accio like this?
[107:45.06]Yeah.
[107:47.38]I guess you better think about what the... Hold on, what?
[107:49.89]Who?
[107:51.59]Oh, hi, mister.
[107:54.61]Perfect timing, Akio.
[107:55.65]I got your RQ3 back.
[107:58.03]Oh, really?
[107:58.81]Yippee.
[108:00.49]Oh, Akio, it's you.
[108:01.47]Oh, my boy.
[108:02.55]Oh, hi, papa.
[108:07.20]Papa?
[108:08.28]You guys are related?
[108:09.22]That's right.
[108:10.48]Are you friends with papa?
[108:12.74]Mister?
[108:15.16]Uh, yeah.
[108:16.24]You might say that.
[108:18.34]Simpsons episode.
[108:21.87]Wait, buddy, that little kid you were telling me about, that was his.
[108:24.41]Yeah, that seems to be how this is shaking up.
[108:35.52]But why, Akio?
[108:36.64]Why didn't you say anything to your papa?
[108:38.20]All you had to do was ask.
[108:40.38]I could have given you the money to buy our Q3 any time.
[108:45.56]You smashed his dad's brain into the pavement in front of him.
[108:49.24]Hey, Jerma sucks.
[108:50.38]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[108:52.92]I beg to differ.
[108:56.57]Because mama always gets mad at you, papa, for spending money on golfing and go-karts and board games.
[109:02.85]And I didn't want mama to get mad at you even more for spending all your money again, papa, so I tried to buy it myself.
[109:10.75]Akio.
[109:12.67]I just like did a huge burp.
[109:14.21]I'm sorry.
[109:14.65]Did you guys hear that?
[109:15.71]I hope you didn't.
[109:17.67]That just hurt.
[109:18.19]It came out of my nostrils.
[109:21.83]I just leaned back and went, and it like it came out of my eyes.
[109:25.17]It went through my sinuses.
[109:26.14]That hurt.
[109:26.54]I'm sorry.
[109:29.32]Mr. Papa looks kind of scary, but he's a really, really nice man once you get to know him.
[109:35.66]Ew.
[109:36.98]Don't share that.
[109:37.78]I share everything.
[109:42.23]He took me to a bunch of game stores just the other day.
[109:44.63]He's not living with mama and me now.
[109:47.29]I think he's lonely.
[109:49.17]Please stay friends with him, okay?
[109:53.38]Actually, Akio, your papa helped me get your RQ3 back.
[109:58.70]Yeah, that's right.
[109:59.68]He did.
[110:00.40]And his dad smiles.
[110:02.18]A big smile, which just bruises all over his face and four of his teeth fall out and blood's all over his mouth.
[110:13.91]Really?
[110:14.39]Thank you, Papa.
[110:15.61]I did in a way.
[110:18.05]I don't want to see you crying again.
[110:21.33]Nice Looney Tunes joke.
[110:23.57]Yeah.
[110:28.75]I think that actually happens like every three episodes.
[110:35.45]How many times has Daffy Duck's teeth fallen out of his mouth?
[110:39.52]After getting like smashed in the head with a board.
[110:43.31]I don't want to see you crying.
[110:44.39]Be careful going home with your game.
[110:47.85]Yep, got it.
[110:48.41]Thank you, mister.
[110:49.05]Hey, mister, thanks.
[110:57.93]This is to apologize or to thank you for teaching this fool a lesson.
[111:02.43]Maybe, whatever.
[111:02.97]I want you to have it.
[111:05.05]Got a sunburst.
[111:06.27]Holy shit.
[111:09.62]What was that?
[111:15.80]Is that a katana?
[111:17.26]A sword?
[111:17.76]From now on, be a good dad all the time, not just in front of Akio.
[111:23.07]You don't want to do anything that'll make kids sad, no matter whose kids they are.
[111:27.29]Yeah, you got that right.
[111:29.97]Papa, this is too hard for me all by myself.
[111:32.46]Let's go to Mama's house and play RQ3 together.
[111:35.94]Oh, my heart is exploding.
[111:38.42]Oh.
[111:45.15]Without the expert advice... Without my expert advice, we'll be making a beeline to that nasty demon lord in no time.
[111:51.19]Well, that's how a game should be played.
[111:56.85]There it is.
[111:57.23]That was very... I like... I loved that.
[112:04.39]That was wonderful.
[112:11.19]That was wonderful.
[112:18.79]I got a sword out of it too.
[112:20.91]Alright.
[112:21.21]What was I doing?
[112:21.85]Oh yeah.
[112:22.41]I need to give champ.
[112:23.13]Do I, where do I get the champagne?
[112:24.29]Yeah, I have, uh, what do I get?
[112:38.15]Okay.
[112:38.25]Then I get a golden champagne.
[112:39.57]Where is it?
[112:52.45]You didn't buy it.
[112:53.49]What?
[112:56.98]I didn't buy it?
[113:00.10]Really?
[113:00.34]I thought I bought it.
[113:07.50]Oh, come on.
[113:08.24]Really?
[113:08.46]Alright.
[113:08.74]Well, I did that quest.
[113:09.53]That was cool.
[113:09.97]So we got to go straight.
[113:10.91]Let me go right and then right.
[113:13.77]Sorry.
[113:15.11]I don't want to be like a coughing Andy.
[113:28.41]Yeah, I want to make sure I say this again.
[113:41.46]For those of you that don't, I'm sick.
[113:43.06]I'm a little sick.
[113:44.52]I'm just trying to stream around being sick.
[113:47.58]I was tested for COVID.
[113:48.46]I'm negative for COVID.
[113:49.66]So, just want to make that clear.
[113:51.24]For those of you that might be concerned, I have been tested.
[113:54.40]I'm negative.
[113:55.89]Ahem.
[113:59.53]Where is this place?
[114:00.07]It's right here, right?
[114:02.01]Wrong side.
[114:03.37]Wrong side.
[114:03.89]Wrong side.
[114:04.63]Wrong side.
[114:05.03]Wrong side.
[114:05.43]Okay.
[114:18.19]Give me something, please.
[114:20.29]Haha.
[114:28.68]Okay.
[114:30.08]I have... Fuck.
[114:32.69]Hold up.
[114:39.67]So, do I actually have to buy the gold one?
[114:45.56]Determine.
[114:45.92]Sorry for being... What?
[114:46.66]What is this coffee pasta?
[114:48.32]Hold on.
[114:51.42]Um...
[115:17.33]No, that's... That's not accurate.
[115:20.71]I don't have, like, a lot of chest hair.
[115:30.34]No, I don't have a lot of chest hair.
[115:31.54]I really don't.
[115:31.96]I have... They kind of sprout up a little bit, and I just go... Bing!
[115:34.84]And I just pull them with, like, a pair of tweezers.
[115:37.55]Because nobody wants to have, like, eight chest hairs, right?
[115:40.57]Like, no.
[115:40.97]Get rid of them.
[115:43.33]I have, like, twelve... Eight to twelve chest hairs, and I just kind of look in the mirror, and I go...
[115:48.94]I just pull them.
[115:51.16]My eyebrows, I do... I pluck my eyebrows.
[115:55.05]I pluck my chest hairs.
[115:57.09]I clean up, right?
[115:58.21]I do some little... I clean up.
[115:59.43]I make sure I'm, you know, make sure I look okay.
[116:07.85]Yeah, sorry.
[116:08.81]Oh, sorry.
[116:09.33]I take care of my hair.
[116:10.39]I don't want it to go out of control.
[116:20.30]You know, you do everything.
[116:21.06]Sometimes I let it go for a little while and you get, you know, you clean it up.
[116:23.26]You don't, I don't want to have like the, I have this wild hair, wild everywhere.
[116:26.99]Next topic.
[116:37.03]Oh, I don't mind.
[116:37.57]I, I, sometimes I want, I mean, you gotta clean up a little.
[116:39.73]You're like Patrick Bateman.
[116:43.89]I'm not like Patrick Bateman.
[116:53.84]Alright, do you have the other thing, too?
[116:56.24]Because I, like, pluck my eyebrows.
[116:59.24]I, like, get my eyebrows done.
[117:03.22]Guys, I get, like, my hands and feet done, too.
[117:07.80]You think that's weird, too?
[117:09.10]You think that's odd?
[117:10.10]Get over it.
[117:25.57]I can't buy anything else from here.
[117:29.70]Yeah, that's self-care.
[117:31.12]Oh, yeah.
[117:31.64]Yeah, come on.
[117:32.40]Hey.
[117:36.46]Yeah, of course.
[117:38.30]I'm just doing a little, you know, TLC.
[117:40.53]Okay, I'm going to give the champagne to the guy.
[117:52.78]THC.
[117:56.67]Chest hair is gross.
[117:58.13]I don't have chest hair.
[118:00.55]Didn't I just sprint?
[118:01.55]Why is it... Okay, I plucked my nose here.
[118:09.09]Yeah, I gotta take care of those too.
[118:11.29]But be careful.
[118:12.03]Be careful.
[118:12.79]I'm gonna give you guys some tips here.
[118:14.95]If you're gonna take care of your nose hairs, just trim them down to like the edge of where your nostrils are.
[118:21.47]Because you can end up with a problem.
[118:23.13]I've had this happen before.
[118:24.03]This is not a joke.
[118:25.51]If you go too far in and you trim too much, you can actually get an ingrown hair in your nose.
[118:33.28]And I've had this happen to me twice.
[118:36.73]I have trimmed my nose hairs to a point where I got an ingrown in my nose, and this shit came out the other side of my nose.
[118:46.19]It was so painful.
[118:47.37]I had an ingrown inside of my nose, and it grew.
[118:50.76]It went out the front of my nose, and I had to pull it out.
[118:55.58]It was horrible.
[118:56.44]It was horrible.
[118:57.44]Please, please, if you're going to trim your nose hairs, do it just to the edge of where your nose hairs are about to touch your nostrils.
[119:06.00]Please don't go.
[119:06.76]Just... You'll end up like me.
[119:10.99]It was awful.
[119:11.85]And it happened twice.
[119:14.95]Please.
[119:18.17]I'm just trying to help you guys.
[119:19.01]Trying to help you out.
[119:22.43]I don't pluck my nose hairs either.
[119:23.66]No.
[119:24.04]I don't do that either.
[119:24.96]The same thing can happen.
[119:26.92]You trim.
[119:28.02]Just trim.
[119:28.86]So they're not all coming out.
[119:30.82]You can't see them.
[119:31.74]It's fine.
[119:32.98]I'm giving you tips.
[119:34.72]You guys want my tips?
[119:35.44]I'm gonna give them to you.
[119:46.75]Nobody asked.
[119:49.53]Did nobody ask?
[119:53.15]Did nobody ask this?
[119:55.45]Why did we start talking about this?
[119:57.09]How about... No, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[120:02.47]You ain't gonna get those tips.
[120:08.75]Nope.
[120:10.11]Not gonna say that one.
[120:12.41]Where do I get the scotch?
[120:20.20]And you want sake.
[120:22.50]Where do I get the sake?
[120:25.82]Just one, please.

[120:33.02]Please just tell us.
[120:33.97]Please give us a secret.
[120:39.24]I'm not going to take tissues from some random person on the street.
[120:46.75]Just one tip.

[138:53.51]Did you say you've worked at Tachibana real estate before?
[138:55.81]Yeah, I've been sitting at the same place all day.
[139:00.57]It's a simple part-time job, after all.
[139:03.25]I just finished one job and got a day's pay.
[139:06.16]I'll be sitting at a different place from tomorrow.
[139:09.38]The one you were working at before was the Aqua building, wasn't it?
[139:19.30]I went to the doctor's office.
[139:21.23]Yeah, I need a doctor's note.
[139:23.17]Is it for work?
[139:24.29]I mean, kind of.
[139:27.73]Should I call it that?
[139:28.91]What are you talking about?
[139:32.11]I make like jokey pretend sex tips to like a bunch of people on the internet.
[139:35.63]And then I like I play a video game in the background.
[139:38.82]Sure, I guess that could be work.
[139:47.84]Pretend?
[139:48.42]Pretend?
[139:49.08]You don't think it was real?
[139:50.40]I was going to tell the doctor that so he doesn't think I'm weird, right?
[139:53.58]Then he leans in and goes, by the way, you're talking about sex tips.
[140:01.85]What are they?
[140:02.93]I gotta spice things up with me and my wife.
[140:06.07]What would you suggest?
[140:06.77]Ah, so that's where the champions are.
[140:07.95]I see you go out a lot.
[140:16.35]That area right now is a mecca for self-improvement.
[140:18.55]Because it's just a small bar.
[140:20.77]If we can get rid of those people and bring them together, the price will be different.
[140:25.27]And the camera pans back, coming out of the office, and I'm like, hey, you ever seen Scooby-Doo?
[140:31.53]And then they're clapping, the studio audience is clapping and laughing, and then we fade out to the credits.
[140:36.21]But that's not just Tachibana Fudo-san.
[140:38.13]They're also aiming for the Toujoukai.
[140:43.65]Made by Dick Wolf.
[140:57.46]The Champion District.
[140:58.76]That may be my ticket to bumping into Chachibana's boys again.
[141:02.74]There's the tweet.
[141:05.16]All I need is the tweet.

[141:07.34]I got the lore tweet.
[141:08.15]I don't need to read anything.
[141:08.93]Ooh, hold on.

[141:11.73]Isn't it over here?
[141:15.04]Oh, it's Marcus.
[141:17.44]Perfect timing.
[141:18.68]There's something I need to talk to you about.
[141:20.04]I'll wait for you back here.
[141:25.69]Do I care about what he has to say right now?
[141:33.59]Look, I heard you're giving out sex tips.
[141:36.45]We're in an alley.
[141:37.09]Nobody can hear us.
[141:38.54]Give me a good one.
[141:43.89]Well, you're on your way somewhere, boy.
[141:45.13]Sorry to hold you up.

[141:56.05]Good.
[141:57.07]Because I have something I'd like to ask you to do.
[141:59.87]If you're willing, that is.
[142:02.67]What's with the hesitation?
[142:04.21]That's not like you.
[142:06.25]Truth is, I've got debt collectors on me tail.
[142:08.91]Scary ones.
[142:11.25]Yeah, I gather you've been running since we met.
[142:14.18]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[142:17.08]Those two-bit jokers are nickel and dime stuff.
[142:21.07]I'm talking tunas.
[142:22.61]Famous, and I mean that in the global sense.
[142:25.91]And now they're here in Japan.
[142:27.65]Hot on my tail.
[142:28.43]Hold on.
[142:31.23]Did you seriously try to escape your mountain of debt by fleeing to Japan?
[142:35.89]Yes.
[142:37.01]And this time, there may be no going back.
[142:39.62]I think there's a price on my head.
[142:42.70]I guess it's too late to pay the money back then.
[142:45.96]What are you going to do, Bacchus?
[142:49.12]Well, I was hoping I could get you to be my bodyguard.
[142:52.94]Figured as much.
[142:54.67]Unfortunately, I've already got enough trouble on my plate.
[142:59.61]Believe me, you'd probably be in worse danger with me around anyways.
[143:03.73]Oh, no.
[143:05.04]That's no way to have a part, please.
[143:08.02]Sure, I can't pay retainer, but if you protect me, I'll teach you some of my top shelf moves.
[143:13.21]Good stuff.
[143:14.91]Oh, wait, what?
[143:16.11]We're going to get tips?
[143:17.83]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[143:18.39]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[143:19.67]You're going to flip this on me?
[143:20.87]Are these moves better than my moves?
[143:25.09]Damn straight they are.
[143:25.91]That'll do you right in a tight fight, me boy.
[143:28.39]Oh, okay.
[143:33.03]Are you Bacchus?
[143:42.00]I think they found me, boy.
[143:42.90]This is the big scary debt collector, huh?
[143:48.02]I'm here for your head.
[143:49.62]Just doing my job.
[143:51.12]So don't hold it against me.
[143:52.42]90.
[143:52.80]Debt collector, huh?
[143:55.12]More like Hitman.
[143:58.09]Oh, you're looking forward to that one too.
[144:00.13]Did you hear that the PSVR is the only version it'll be on?
[144:04.21]And it's only going to be on the PS4 version of Hitman 3?
[144:07.93]That immediately deduces a full letter grade from that fucking game.
[144:11.96]I can't believe it either.
[144:13.20]It's a stupid decision.
[144:16.38]Please help me.
[144:25.01]I guess I don't have much of a choice.
[144:26.07]If I left you here, I'd be putting a bullet in your head myself.
[144:28.79]Stand back.
[144:29.35]Get out of here.
[144:32.35]No, settle down.
[144:33.65]Actually, delete that.
[144:34.37]Delete that one.
[144:35.53]For real, delete it.
[144:38.24]Delete it.
[144:39.60]You're protecting this guy?
[144:41.00]For now, I don't especially feel like watching him die.
[144:47.84]I see.
[144:48.42]Fine.
[144:49.14]There may be not a price on your head, but I'll see if I can swing a bonus afterwards.
[144:55.61]Crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack knuckle, crack crack.
[144:59.55]Here we go.
[145:01.81]Way ahead of you, old man.
[145:07.47]Mysterious Hitman.
[145:16.12]That's all it takes.
[145:19.47]He just has to shoot you for real.
[145:26.75]Don't shoot me with that.
[145:28.41]Get off me.
[145:29.92]Oh.
[145:38.33]Give me this!
[145:42.47]Oh shit!
[145:49.34]Get up!
[145:52.96]What's that?
[145:57.08]Nails?
[145:57.36]Wait!
[145:57.66]Spike!
[146:14.71]Use the sword.
[146:19.88]Gah!
[146:21.58]I'm letting you live.
[146:23.50]You go back and tell whoever ordered to hit to forget about Bacchus.
[146:27.54]You hear me?
[146:42.96]There'll be others on this trail soon enough.
[146:44.36]They'll get what's coming to him.
[146:46.52]This is the worst Yakuza dub.
[146:49.34]You think so?
[146:50.58]Alright.
[146:51.22]That's a one-guy moment.
[146:52.12]I'm fucking gonna actually try really hard here.
[146:56.97]There'll be others on this trail soon enough.
[146:58.89]You'll get what's coming to him.
[147:02.97]Hold on.
[147:03.29]You stay right fucking there.
[147:04.91]Don't leave the stream.
[147:05.63]I saw your name.
[147:09.31]Sorry, boy.
[147:11.17]Why the apology?
[147:13.09]I told you to watch out for a knife in your ribs.
[147:15.22]Hey, you, hold on.
[147:15.80]Now you're in my head.
[147:19.60]I told you.
[147:20.86]I told you to watch out for a knife in your ribs.
[147:23.32]And here I am putting you in danger myself.
[147:26.70]Don't worry about that.
[147:28.26]I'd rather hear more about the offer you made earlier.
[147:31.07]This is bad.
[147:34.81]You said you'd teach me some new moves.
[147:36.31]I better make it quick, though, before the next hitman gets here.
[147:42.40]You sure about this, boy?
[147:45.88]I don't have much of a choice.
[147:47.34]That person's in my head now.
[147:49.08]I can just see this is the worst dub ever.
[147:51.16]It's just flashing in front of my head.
[147:53.46]I don't have much choice.
[147:56.60]Like I said, I've got my own problems.
[147:59.52]So a few extra survival skills would come in handy.
[148:04.77]Alright.
[148:05.53]Then let me fill you in on some moves that'll send those hitmen reeling.
[148:17.85]Sounds pretty simple for a secret.
[148:25.53]Though I guess in a fight, simplicity is best.
[148:45.92]Brawling comes down to spirit in the end, so I'm going to teach you a move that harnesses that power.
[148:52.40]I call it Spirit Fire.
[148:55.82]Spirit Fire?
[148:58.12]Interesting.
[148:59.50]So you use the force of an enemy's blow to strike them back with twice the power?
[149:03.58]Yes.
[149:04.60]Yes.
[149:06.12]I'm sure you'll be able to make use of it.
[149:10.75]Hey, you're Bacchus, right?
[149:15.72]Oh, another guy.
[149:17.50]It's one of those Japanese hooligans.
[149:21.40]You call yourself an assassin?
[149:23.30]You look about as pro as some sorry street punk.
[149:26.85]I don't really know what's going on here, but I just got paid a fortune up front by some guy in chat.
[149:32.49]A one guy.
[149:33.21]I get the rest once the job's done.
[149:37.33]Oh, so he's a Street Fighter on a freelance job.
[149:40.99]He doesn't look so tough.
[149:43.60]Shut it.
[149:44.62]I may not look like much, but I've never lost a fight.
[149:47.34]Time to earn this cash.
[149:49.24]Please don't smash my head over and over and get into the wall.
[149:51.74]Please don't use a bike on me and smash the bike over my head and get a million dollars.
[149:55.78]Don't kick me in the head while I'm on the ground and crush my head.
[149:58.80]Let's go, you fucking loser.
[150:01.19]I think you've got the tenacity to win.
[150:04.57]This is the perfect chance, boy.
[150:05.95]Yeah.
[150:08.81]Time to try out that move I just learned.
[150:11.74]What?
[150:14.44]You want some first, do you?
[150:15.98]Alright, open up, sir.
[150:17.22]I'll serve you your tea.
[150:28.11]Oops, I just skipped it.
[150:33.77]Holy shit.
[150:34.69]What?
[150:34.87]I have a gun too?
[150:37.27]Wait, what?
[150:37.71]I have a weapon?
[150:41.53]You can charge up a counterattack.
[150:42.85]The attack is more powerful and likely to knock the opponent... Stard!
[150:47.37]Stard!
[150:48.61]Hold down X or Y after being attacked.
[151:02.04]Yeah!
[151:07.04]Okay.
[151:08.02]Defeat the hitman targeting Bacchus.
[151:10.71]Use your brawler style of moves to take out the assassin.
[151:17.55]I'm trying to counterattack.
[151:21.16]I want to do the thing that just topples.
[151:35.06]You wanna do that?
[151:35.74]Throw him into the trash.
[151:44.65]Ow!
[151:48.37]Just... Can I just shoot him?
[151:58.64]Dodge, dodge, dodge.
[152:00.50]Just...
[152:09.30]Right in the face.
[152:10.58]Yeah.
[152:11.18]Alright.
[152:11.42]Let's go.
[152:11.80]Should have saved up.
[152:17.03]That was a mistake.
[152:19.67]Holy shit.
[152:20.17]That dodge, though.
[152:21.29]I'm going to die.
[152:23.57]Wait.
[152:24.69]Step on his head.
[152:32.04]Run, run, run, run.
[152:32.94]Kick.
[152:37.50]Tried to grab me, didn't you?
[152:38.60]No.
[152:44.59]Get over here.
[152:55.33]Hmm.
[152:56.89]I might have no more drink.
[153:00.59]Happy holidays.
[153:01.25]Happy holidays to you too.
[153:04.40]Boy wins.
[153:04.80]Hey.
[153:04.98]Yeah?
[153:06.96]What?
[153:07.82]What does the guy that paid you look like?
[153:12.68]Uh, it was dark.
[153:13.22]I didn't get a look at their face.
[153:14.22]From the way they talked, I guess they were foreign.
[153:15.80]Imagine me.
[153:17.59]Of course not.
[153:19.11]Yeah, it was him.
[153:19.71]It was him.
[153:22.13]Did you guys hear that?
[153:24.33]That was like a person talking out of my throat.
[153:29.01]It was like, no, it wasn't.
[153:31.59]Did anybody hear that?
[153:32.27]Maybe my noise gate didn't pick it up.
[153:36.68]I went, oh, blah, blah, blah.
[153:38.08]Oh, I hope it got picked up.
[153:40.66]It was weird.
[153:50.21]Stop getting CBD injections.
[153:58.88]It was Jerma's tapeworm.
[154:01.88]Jerma, is chat your little PogChamp?
[154:05.98]Yeah, I don't know.
[154:06.94]Sure.
[154:11.44]Looks like you handled this one no problem.
[154:15.14]We better hope they're all like this.
[154:20.75]Alright, I'm injured.
[154:22.13]I need to drink.
[154:22.71]I need to drink.
[154:26.31]Okay, I feel better.
[154:32.55]4 million... was that 4 million off the debt if I... 4 million off the debt to improv an apology video for showing your genitals on stream.
[154:45.84]No, that's not enough.
[155:07.30]Okay, let me do the story mission.
[155:09.60]I've been playing for like three hours and I don't think I've done anything.
[155:12.98]Heh.
[155:22.86]People are chasing me.
[155:23.44]I don't want to fight them.
[155:24.10]I just want to... Wait, how much money do I have?
[155:26.33]Oh, shit.
[155:26.93]Hold on.
[155:27.27]I need to do this.
[155:34.81]Not enough.
[155:37.31]Wait, what about these?
[155:38.89]Two million.
[155:39.39]Reduce the damage you take when thrown by an enemy.
[155:42.69]It's only two million.
[155:45.63]Reduce the rate that the heat gauge drops down over time.
[155:51.21]What about beast?
[155:54.66]Increase the power of your regular attacks and heat actions in beast style.
[155:57.68]It's a no-brainer.
[156:01.26]Go to the shrine.
[156:06.46]Boost max health.
[156:07.45]Yeah, of course.
[156:10.89]What else we got?
[156:16.13]Charge forward while keeping your guard up.
[156:17.93]You won't be staggered by attacks below a certain power level.
[156:20.41]Okay.
[156:21.28]What up here?
[156:29.43]This is kind of good.
[156:30.59]What's after that?
[156:39.82]I'm going to see what's over here.
[156:41.26]Boost the power of your attacks when in heat mode.
[156:47.12]Yeah.
[156:51.00]Did I just unlock this thing over here?
[156:54.31]You are less likely to falter during a rush combo when in heat mode.
[156:58.34]400 million dollars!
[157:03.46]We have a confirmed offer.
[157:04.88]We have an offer here.
[157:05.52]Hold on.
[157:07.56]Confirmed offer.
[157:08.31]Wait, wait, wait.
[157:08.89]What is it?
[157:12.21]New offer.
[157:12.89]Read to us green eggs and ham without fucking up once.
[157:15.93]Remove 75 million.
[157:16.45]Okay.
[157:16.55]Okay.
[157:24.06]Without fucking up once?
[157:26.32]Is that a deal?
[157:26.80]Okay.
[157:34.97]I don't have green eggs and ham.
[157:36.09]I don't own it.
[157:36.49]Okay, I got it.
[157:45.94]No, I got it.
[157:46.28]Okay.
[157:48.32]Green eggs and ham.

[157:52.34]Sam I am.
[157:53.75]That's Sam I am.
[157:54.85]That's Sam I am.
[157:56.01]I do not like that Sam I am.
[157:59.17]Do would you like green eggs and ham?
[158:02.01]I do not like them, Sam I am.
[158:04.41]I do not like green eggs and ham.
[158:07.27]Would you like them here or there?
[158:08.71]Wait, show it?
[158:12.63]Okay, here.
[158:13.22]Alright, alright, alright, I'll do it.
[158:16.72]I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[158:18.18]Hold on to me.
[158:18.72]I was in the middle of something.
[158:31.39]Okay, where is it?
[158:38.52]You can't see it.
[158:42.60]I love how there's an anti-aliasing here.
[158:46.42]Can you not see it?
[158:46.98]Fuck.
[158:55.67]Is it too much text here?
[158:58.19]I'll take a screenshot.
[158:58.89]Hold on.
[159:02.83]I have it in a text file.
[159:08.54]You should be able to see it.
[159:09.54]How come the... Huh, that's weird.
[159:17.88]Read it faster.
[159:20.30]Don't... Get relief... Have... Wait, what?
[159:24.73]How come I can't get this to show?
[159:25.71]I'll just have to take a screenshot.
[159:28.47]It's a long book, man.
[159:33.65]Wait, can you see if I do this?
[159:34.65]I'm just trying to put the text on the screen.
[159:37.49]Okay, hold on.
[159:45.36]Is it showing up yet?
[159:48.70]Anybody see it?
[159:52.32]Not showing up at all.
[159:59.35]You can't even see it at all.
[160:04.86]No, you can't see it.
[160:05.66]Alright, so I'm using Streamlabs OBS for the last time.
[160:08.99]It's literally the last day I'm going to use it.
[160:10.29]I'm uninstalling this shit as soon as I get off the fucking stream.
[160:18.60]Okay, hold on.
[160:24.16]You said that last year.
[160:25.54]I know.
[160:29.77]I'm gonna put... Hold on.

[164:10.52]Background cartoon music.
[164:11.92]Royalty-free.
[164:13.08]No copyright cartoon music.

[165:05.15]Jeremiah Hades and Otto Cerberus.
[165:08.45]Alright, give me a sec.

[165:10.88]That's really good.
[165:14.28]Boppities?
[165:14.72]What the hell is Boppities?
[165:15.60]Boppities, that's not even a real person.
[165:17.18]It's not.
[165:18.40]Very good.
[165:19.20]Very good shit.
[165:20.70]Alright, let me see.
[165:21.24]I gotta capture this window.
[165:23.60]Let's go back to here.
[165:26.78]And, uh, I'm gonna... What is this an image of?
[165:30.06]Alright, I'm just gonna put this on the screen because I don't... Whatever.
[165:37.96]I gotta hide the window for a sec.
[165:39.02]Okay.
[165:45.55]Just look at that for a minute.
[165:50.83]Uh, where is it?
[165:55.66]Okay.

[165:59.52]I'm going to try.
[166:00.12]I have it here.
[166:01.84]I just, like, I was there.
[166:03.72]I'm going to try.
[166:04.24]I'm going to go for it.
[166:04.84]Let's see if I can get it.
[166:11.51]Okay.
[166:12.43]Here we go.
[166:15.73]Green Eggs and Ham by Dr. Seuss.
[166:21.77]Is it $75 million if I get it right?
[166:29.45]Okay, I'm ready.
[166:31.26]Ready?
[166:31.52]Oh, hello, everyone.

[184:25.34]Yes, some are red, some are blue.
[184:28.46]Some are old and some are new.

[184:36.43]Excuse me.
[184:42.48]I can't do that.
[184:48.02]Once the lady screamed, it's like, I can't.
[184:59.88]You lost, friend.
[185:02.64]Why are you here?
[185:03.24]There's no place in this neighborhood to serve a Yakuza like you.

[185:17.46]No, I can't do it.
[185:18.56]I can't.
[185:19.02]No, I can't.
[185:20.66]I can't.
[185:20.96]That's a long book.

[185:42.33]No emotion, right?
[185:43.19]Don't laugh for like subs and stuff.

[186:11.06]And you just like brought it up so that I was like, hey.
[186:18.30]I have a dry cough today.
[186:19.32]It's being annoying.
[186:20.32]I think it's because my nasal drip is being annoying.
[186:23.09]I'm definitely getting over it though.

[186:59.80]Of course, there are always stakes here.
[187:04.24]Always high stakes here.
[187:24.88]Thanks to the Yakuza, they've been able to protect us.
[187:28.92]Thanks to them, we have the chance to win the championship today.
[187:32.95]What did you say?
[187:35.67]That's right, Oda-san.
[187:40.51]Yeah, we'll do webcam.
[187:41.39]I'll make sure the cam's on.
[187:43.30]Is this guy again?
[187:44.00]Didn't you say he was from Katagi?
[187:53.79]You guys have to be able to verify it or not.
[187:56.21]I can't just sit here with the mic muted.
[187:59.39]Hmm.
[188:22.10]Can you please stop this Yakuza bit and go back to the Dr. Seuss stream?
[188:32.00]No, not today. ...
[188:55.01]What did the president say?
[188:56.91]If you want to know more about us, come to the room where I met the president.
[189:02.09]He said he would meet you directly.
[189:05.03]I see.
[189:05.69]I understand.
[189:08.70]Don't come here anymore.
[189:12.72]The people here hate Yakuza.
[189:14.26]By the way, is it true that you are protecting the champion world from Yakuza?
[189:24.44]Well, for the time being.
[189:27.47]There's a president's policy.
[189:30.55]The land around here belongs to the people who have been burned before the Kamurocho war.
[189:34.85]Our president says that this is the root of the Kamurocho.
[189:38.29]There is no right for a dead person like us to do whatever we want.
[189:48.50]Your attitude is quite different from when you were in the building earlier.
[189:53.30]The people there are just a bunch of passers-by.
[189:59.34]You've seen the manager of Snack Namase, right?
[190:02.63]He said he was also a victim of the enemy.
[190:05.89]When they came from the other side, they were driving away the former resident.
[190:10.09]He's called Inga Oho.
[190:19.24]Play the OG Diablo already, man.
[190:21.39]I know you want to.
[190:22.11]I told you earlier, you know.
[190:23.19]I played Diablo II with somebody and just, like, chill.
[190:26.13]I played D2.
[190:27.55]Eat snacks.
[190:27.89]Stop reading chat.
[190:28.49]Oh, fuck.
[190:28.65]I'm sorry.
[190:28.87]What are you going to do in the end?
[190:30.57]Are you going to meet my president?
[190:50.76]D2 and chill.
[190:51.90]Stop it, I'm trying to read the video.
[190:59.02]Alright, I didn't even need to read it.
[191:05.36]What, did we get a TL;DR tweet?
[191:07.54]Come on.
[191:09.72]No TL;DR lore tweet.
[191:12.28]Mmm, not good.
[191:17.31]Are you bored?
[191:17.97]No, of course not.
[191:23.09]Save it though.
[191:29.88]I'm not bored.
[191:30.40]Hey, chef.
[191:31.84]Thanks for the five community subs, chef.
[191:34.00]Peace.
[191:35.30]Thank you.
[191:35.64]How many times do I save the game?
[191:49.13]Trying just to fast track the story.
[191:56.40]Irma, several people would like to have a word with you in the Discord.
[192:00.74]Somebody wants to have a word with me in the Discord, so I have to just like go in there and just listen to them?
[192:06.45]What?
[192:07.85]Several people want to have a word with me in the Discord?
[192:11.69]I wonder how loud the screams are going to be when I go into voice one.
[192:16.13]I wonder how loud it's going to be when I hurt myself, my ears going into voice one in the Discord.
[192:27.86]That Oda guy said if I wait in the penthouse here, he'll show up.
[192:30.55]Let's go.
[192:44.75]He just ruined the Discord.
[192:46.01]Well... Sorry.
[192:49.11]I ain't going in there.
[192:55.32]The fight.
[192:55.96]If it's a fight you're looking for, it's a fight you'll get.
[193:08.23]The next chapter is on Jima.
[193:16.28]Is that a different city or something?
[193:18.28]With new mini-games?
[193:20.38]I'm just trying to get through the story to play more mini-games.
[193:22.22]That's all I care about.
[193:27.23]Hmph.
[193:27.89]Isn't that a mistake?
[193:34.14]What?
[193:34.82]A young thug would come barging in and I would greet him with gentle bruising.
[193:38.78]Oh, it was that jerk with the Jerma hair.
[193:53.94]Shit, I'm sorry.
[193:55.10]I'm like doing this a lot off.
[193:57.90]I'm trying to mute you catch them.
[194:19.71]It's like 500 people in Voice 1.
[194:21.37]What are you guys trying to do?
[194:23.09]Break the server?
[194:24.95]Don't do that.
[194:27.78]I'm sure you're all singing your own songs that you have on Spotify.
[194:33.78]Oh, by the way, somebody said, hey, dude, do the Spotify thing where you, like, show what you've been listening to on Spotify.
[194:38.71]I don't even have Spotify installed on any device.
[194:41.89]I've never listened to Spotify for one day.
[194:55.73]Ooh, bonus lightning fast.
[194:59.40]No, no, no, no, no.
[194:59.94]Don't do that.
[195:00.28]I want to hit somebody with it.
[195:01.64]Oh, right in the table.

[196:30.42]I'm sorry.
[196:30.96]I'm just sitting over here, pepe-deeing.
[196:37.06]What?
[196:44.57]You're pretty good in a fight, but good enough to merit President Tachibana personally recruiting you?
[196:49.64]I just don't know.
[196:50.42]You'll have to fight me and throw me through this window.
[196:56.18]Guaranteed, and I'll fall onto the street and die.
[196:57.59]That's why...
[197:13.70]What kind of weapon is that?

[202:04.74]It's one hit away from breaking?
[202:05.66]Is it?
[202:05.88]It has durability?
[202:07.11]Was I supposed to save that for the end of the game?
[202:38.42]summarize the story please okay if I can sure I met a girl at the bowling alley and I really like her and I met a girl at the store and I really like her I'm trying to hang I'm trying to see who I want to hang out with um and a little kid got his PlayStation 3 stolen and I got it back and I taught the guys the kid's dad a lesson
[203:03.20]These other guys, I don't know.
[203:04.94]These are like side characters to me.
[203:06.26]I don't even care.
[203:08.66]This is like side story bullshit.
[203:11.22]I, Kiryu-san, see this town as the bait for the Tojoukai, starting with the Dojima clan.
[203:16.91]People and money gather in this town, colored by neon all night long.
[203:23.23]The sweet juice from there is all absorbed by the Tojoukai.
[203:33.93]Play Ellen Degenerate slots.
[203:38.36]I won like $200 on an Ellen Degenerate slot one time.
[203:43.70]I think it was like $300 actually.
[204:07.23]What the hell is he doing?
[204:09.88]What?
[204:10.14]Why does the guy have magneto powers?
[204:22.24]Money is power.
[204:23.28]I want to see how far my power can reach the Tojo world.
[204:28.43]But there's still a long way to go.
[204:40.26]Oh, it's scripted.
[204:41.86]I see.
[204:42.60]He like told all the people to turn the lights off for five seconds just to give me a point.
[204:46.45]What are you?
[205:07.28]Whether Kiryu-san knows or not, the Tojoukai is not a small organization.
[205:11.59]As proof, there is one person who cooperates with me in the Tojoukai.
[205:15.65]And the reason I approached you is because I was strongly recommended by that person.
[205:31.38]Must play pocket racing.
[205:33.28]Once I get to the new city, I'm just going to play the mini games and then turn the stream off.
[205:37.17]I'm going to play the mini games for like two hours.
[205:39.29]What?
[205:40.85]That's my friend.
[205:41.63]That's the guy that I know.
[206:01.04]That's the person that's my friend.
[206:02.32]The secret.
[206:07.14]I'm the secret.
[206:32.41]I feel like I'm jumping in halfway through a movie that I have not seen any of.
[206:45.07]And I've been here the whole time.
[206:47.32]Hey, what are you watching, man?
[206:49.80]Oh, it's this cool boy who called Yakuza 0.
[206:53.18]Oh, let's sit down and just watch it or whatever.

[207:01.40]You gotta just jump in.
[207:02.24]Just chill. ...

[213:26.14]And this shop is... Oh, that seat over there.
[213:29.49]That's definitely a Yakuza.
[213:31.25]I'm going home after all.
[213:35.41]It's really okay.
[213:36.37]There are certainly some ugly shops, but it's definitely safe for this shop.
[213:44.66]With origami.
[213:56.95]in those briefcases.
[213:58.97]How do you fit in there?
[213:59.99]You can't really fit much in there.
[214:03.33]Destroy, dude.
[214:03.89]Thanks for the six subs.
[214:04.96]Appreciate it.
[214:25.84]Hot towel?
[214:26.68]Oh, I love hot towels.
[214:29.16]Good evening.
[214:30.32]Excuse me.
[214:31.16]Excuse me.
[214:35.12]Oh, no.
[214:38.32]Good evening.
[214:38.72]What do you think?
[214:40.45]There's a lot of girls here.
[214:42.01]This person is the boss of a big company in Tokyo.
[214:46.75]Hey, you two, show your faces.
[214:48.59]Oh, he's the boss after all.
[214:55.32]Quick, give him tips.
[214:57.20]Like, in his ear.
[214:57.70]Listen, listen, listen.
[215:00.02]Don't be cool.
[215:02.04]What you're going to do is you're going to take a shot at the alcoholic ring over.
[215:09.53]Don't look straight ahead.
[215:10.61]You're going to take a shot at the alcoholic ring over.
[215:23.92]Thank you.
[215:24.22]Good.
[215:24.34]Good, good, good, good.
[215:26.02]Make sure he gets the milk.
[215:27.36]And you got way more.
[215:28.50]Make sure he takes the milk.
[215:54.87]Very good, very good.
[215:55.63]Get three bottles.
[215:58.64]And take two of them.
[216:00.98]I want one.
[216:01.86]It's hard to get that kind of Japanese whiskey.
[216:04.86]Take one for me, please.
[216:05.72]Those are customs, please.
[216:14.92]Alright, now what are you going to do?
[216:16.58]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[216:17.96]Agreed.
[216:18.26]Agreed.
[216:18.64]Agreed with him.
[216:19.54]Agreed with him right now.
[216:21.42]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[216:21.98]I'll take two.
[216:22.60]I want two of those.
[216:24.34]I want two of those bottles.
[216:26.55]Okay.
[216:27.09]Hands on your sides.
[216:27.99]And I want you to shrug your shoulders.
[216:34.19]Don't drink too much though.
[216:34.99]You've been drinking a lot.
[216:36.17]You're doing good.
[216:37.91]You're doing good.
[216:39.26]Alright.
[216:39.88]Less, less.
[216:40.40]Way less.
[216:41.66]Way less.
[216:43.67]Am I still in your ear?
[216:45.03]Hello?
[216:45.41]Can you hear me?
[216:46.55]Can you still hear me?
[216:47.71]It was a different guy.
[216:48.39]I thought it was like a guy that we cut.
[216:52.06]It was like he was going wild.
[217:06.05]Oh, is it really that much different from Shining?
[217:12.65]That's right.
[217:13.29]From the beginning to the end, even things that can't be said in a loud voice, it seems to have been done in a very flashy way.
[217:20.63]The size of the box alone made this shop a top 100,000 people.
[217:23.99]Oh, it seems to be a lot of work.
[217:29.87]Uh-huh.
[217:56.40]Come on, kick this guy's ass!
[217:57.88]What the fuck?
[217:58.56]What the fuck?
[218:24.86]Smash a saxophone over that guy's head.
[218:26.32]Guy in the front row, go up there and smash it over the fucking head.
[218:31.08]Why are you saying that?
[218:35.90]It's because he's coming out.
[218:55.75]Him.
[219:08.47]It's him.
[219:25.37]He's gonna kill this guy.
[219:54.35]I'm sorry.
[219:54.91]My name is Majima.
[220:02.02]I thought Majima was like a city or something.
[220:05.60]It's the guy.
[220:06.26]You're like, wait till you get to Majima.
[220:10.12]You're going to love it at Majima.
[220:11.32]I'm sorry for the inconvenience.
[220:16.10]Even though it looks like this, it's just a shirt.
[220:19.02]More importantly, sir.
[220:23.70]I'm afraid, but I would like to ask you to refrain from touching and violent acts at this shop.
[220:29.18]If you're a muscle man, try to come here with force.
[220:34.46]I won't let you down.
[220:35.94]That's not the case.
[220:36.96]The customer is God.
[220:38.83]That's a good idea.
[220:58.08]I like your attitude.
[220:59.10]This is a treat.
[220:59.92]Just drink it.
[221:01.53]How is the blessing from God?
[221:05.63]Thank you.
[221:27.60]I wanted to drink this sake to get drunk, but... Thanks to you, my dream came true.
[221:34.70]You bastard.
[221:35.14]Oh, nice try.
[221:35.96]Customer, please repeat after me.
[221:57.46]Oi!
[221:58.12]Ahahahah!
[221:58.60]Ahahahahahah!
[222:25.66]Actually, getting your ass kicked to a beat at a club, you're never going to live that one down.
[222:30.94]If that's what you want, then I will be your opponent.
[222:33.61]However, I will not give you any help.
[222:36.55]After all, you are a god.
[222:37.57]So, you still want to get away with that?
[222:58.86]Okay, wait, what?
[223:05.89]Don't, I can't, don't, don't hit him?
[223:08.79]Wrong cards.
[223:09.65]Don't punch him.
[223:10.51]Don't hit him.
[223:13.13]Avoid the customer's attacks.
[223:14.66]Wait, I'm playing the first law of management.
[223:18.10]Customer is king, even if punched or kicked.
[223:21.16]Prizal is out of the question.
[223:24.00]For now, watch for the customer to make a move and then evade their attacks using A. Really?
[223:34.11]Okay.
[223:36.99]Oh, it hurt.
[223:43.73]Okay.
[223:44.91]Second law of management.
[223:47.39]Customer is king, even in the worst of times you must never forget to provide only the finest service.
[223:52.17]Patience shall be rewarded, as now it is time to show all your customers the ultimate in hospitality.
[223:59.65]Press Y in front of an attacking customer with the heat gauge at 3rd bar.
[224:08.73]What?
[224:10.03]What the fuck is going on?
[224:20.22]What?
[224:21.24]This is so bizarre.
[224:28.05]Would you like a towel, sir?
[224:30.47]Okay.
[224:32.85]Okay.
[224:50.59]The customer always comes first.
[224:51.85]That's dangerous!
[224:54.25]Don't underestimate me!
[224:57.38]Wait.
[225:00.16]Did I hurt him?
[225:00.74]It's dangerous, so we'll take care of it.
[225:02.82]Good job!
[225:03.28]Good job!
[225:03.76]Good job!
[225:04.32]Good job!
[225:14.32]Thank you very much, Manager.
[225:15.28]What are you doing, you bastard?
[225:18.02]I'll call the police.
[225:24.43]Just...justice.
[225:26.85]Non-violent justice.
[225:29.31]As you can see, this customer has repeatedly committed illegal acts in the store and has caused trouble to all of you.
[225:38.37]Originally, you should have been sent to the police as it is.
[225:43.83]However...
[225:48.17]I was saying to smash the fucking saxophone over his head.
[225:51.03]We're very different, I guess.
[225:51.93]I have a favor to ask of you.
[226:18.31]What the hell?
[226:20.31]Oh, we got dirt.
[226:20.93]Oh.
[226:51.90]This is ridiculous.
[227:17.17]If everyone's okay with it, he's gonna buy all their trains.
[227:22.07]Is that a way to get him to spend more money?
[227:24.45]Spin.
[227:24.67]Did I have played from this guy from the beginning?
[227:42.64]Can I play Yakuza colon Majima?
[227:49.80]A round of applause.
[227:50.60]Oh, yes, yes, thank you.
[228:19.87]That was awesome.
[228:27.55]That was the coolest thing in the whole game, yeah.
[229:01.31]So do we just take control now?
[229:04.63]Are we like in a different place?
[229:05.75]I guess kind of.
[229:08.12]Huh.
[229:29.71]It's a parallel campaign.
[229:34.52]Oh, cool.
[229:35.28]Cool.
[229:37.68]Is it like GTA?
[229:38.50]Can I never play as the other guy again?
[229:39.78]Can I go through the entire story as just one character and just never play as the other one?
[230:06.07]What's going on?
[230:06.73]What is happening here?
[230:07.65]Holy shit.
[230:12.45]I love Mojima.
[230:15.47]That was a lit cigarette and he just dropped the lit cigarette on the ground.
[230:20.12]He just showed behind the curtain.
[230:23.36]Yes.
[230:36.57]I'll bet.
[230:37.17]See that?
[230:37.39]Maki-chan gets a bonus tonight.
[230:39.29]Nothing kills Morale like getting that.
[230:42.86]So I own this place.
[230:44.88]Yeah.
[230:45.70]But otherwise, just try and keep an eye on it.
[231:07.29]Oh yeah, he might try to run out of the tab.
[231:15.14]You run the place, okay.
[231:18.56]I'm paying so much attention now.
[231:20.41]I'm like, oh, who's this guy?
[231:21.99]Oh, Majima, does he own the place?
[231:24.89]Who's the staff members?
[231:26.15]Where is this?
[231:26.81]Oh.
[231:35.43]I feel like it just turned on, like, Yakuza 1.
[231:38.40]Next Yakuza game.
[231:39.22]Here it is.
[231:39.68]May as well go see her now and get this over with.
[231:43.48]She's probably in the dressing room.
[232:08.64]Alright, cool.
[232:09.56]And there's like a S here?
[232:11.38]Save point.
[232:14.94]Oh, nice.
[232:15.40]How much money do I have in my bank account on this guy?
[232:16.94]30,000 yen?
[232:27.17]What?
[232:32.22]I managed like a big hotel casino entertainment venue.
[232:36.84]I only got 30,000 yen in my pocket.
[232:39.40]Should be four zeros added to that.
[232:40.80]Alright, dressing room.
[232:45.29]Where are the dressing rooms?
[232:52.65]Wait, wait, wait.
[232:53.05]Let's talk to these guys.
[232:55.66]See how they're doing.
[232:56.70]Can I talk?
[233:03.46]What an incredible spot.
[233:05.34]I had no idea Sotenbori was hiding such a gem.
[233:09.37]I'll be making this my regular spot whenever I'm in town.
[233:13.55]I mean, I'm just like, look, oh, he's paying attention now.
[233:17.91]He wants to talk to everybody.
[233:18.83]He's in like the casino.
[233:19.75]He's in like the fucking hotel.
[233:20.97]Like, let's go.
[233:21.57]Welcome to Vegas.
[233:23.34]Whatever.
[233:23.74]Alright.
[233:24.14]That's interesting to me.
[233:25.18]I like it.
[233:32.97]Where are the dressing rooms, though?
[233:34.17]Just walk around?
[233:34.71]I'm gonna go down.
[233:46.89]Got a minute?
[233:55.01]Oh, sorry about that.
[233:56.05]What can I do for you?
[233:57.67]Can you call Kane for me?
[233:59.43]I need to talk to her.
[234:01.40]Yes, sir.
[234:01.74]Of course.
[234:07.67]What's this deal?
[234:08.35]Spacing out on the clock.
[234:09.48]Hi, sir.
[234:17.62]Nice work out there tonight.
[234:19.68]Thanks, Kane-Chen.
[234:22.50]So, you wanted to talk to me.
[234:23.46]You said she was locking horns with Sakurako.
[234:28.79]Hmm.
[234:29.13]Where do I start?
[234:30.75]Hmm.
[234:31.33]Alright.
[234:31.61]Do we lay down the law?
[234:32.71]I think not.
[234:33.07]I think we'd be like, hey, let's talk for a minute here.
[234:40.79]uh yeah you're really smoking tonight babe I thought some new idol singer wandered in oh you that kind of flattery won't get anybody but paying customers anywhere sir what is that wrong that right I take it back then what so it was just flattery huh you wound me boss
[235:01.37]Oh, come on.
[235:01.93]You know I can't tell a lie.
[235:03.65]Here, I'll buy you dinner sometime soon.
[235:05.17]You forgive me?
[235:06.82]Really?
[235:07.38]Oh, I love you, sir.
[235:08.66]This is idiotic.
[235:10.78]Time to get to the point.
[235:11.54]It's been about a month since you came on here.
[235:14.46]Yeah?
[235:15.38]How's it going?
[235:16.02]Think you can make a real go of it at the Grand?
[235:20.73]Oh, I think so.
[235:21.89]The hall's much bigger than the last club I worked at, so it was pretty daunting at first, but I'm totally used to it now.
[235:28.06]And more and more.
[235:31.22]And more and more customers are coming here specifically to see me.
[235:34.76]Yeah, that's great to hear.
[235:37.94]Not surprising from the number one gal from one of the oldest cabarets in the Kita area.
[235:42.47]I guess I was imagining things then.
[235:45.95]What do you mean?
[235:47.47]Oh, see the one month marks actually when I see that most girls up and leave.
[235:52.33]I was a little worried we might be getting the itch too.
[235:58.56]Damn, girl.
[236:03.08]Hag?
[236:05.25]This is pretty serious.
[236:11.91]Aw, don't be like that.
[236:13.65]Sakurako's a vet here.
[236:15.55]She looks after the other girls, too.
[236:18.54]Most love that about her.
[236:20.54]Try to get along, yeah?
[236:22.90]Oh, I hate nosy types like that.
[236:25.30]And she's got a whole entourage.
[236:27.75]Whatever.
[236:28.23]Soon I'll have my own clique and I won't have to deal with them.
[236:31.81]Does she even realize she's getting lectured here?
[236:34.89]Dance as a door, this one.
[236:37.03]She's even giving me a little too.
[236:38.51]Alright, we're gonna go more direct.
[236:44.07]Direct.
[236:47.91]Better make it loud and clear for her.
[236:50.59]That ain't right.
[236:51.45]You gotta learn to read the room.
[236:55.47]Huh?
[236:55.65]Huh?
[236:57.30]Doesn't matter how good you are at your job, how popular you get.
[237:00.53]You've snubbed your seniors like that and you'll wake up one day with nothing but enemies here.
[237:05.85]Fine by me.
[237:06.69]Not like I did the job to make friends with the other girls.
[237:10.35]Really?
[237:10.63]Is that the best you can do?
[237:14.07]I'm disappointed.
[237:16.08]I doubt you'll be around here long enough to make those enemies then.
[237:20.94]Wait, what's that supposed to mean?
[237:23.56]Is there a problem with my work?
[237:26.50]Nailed it.
[237:27.68]She's the competitive type.
[237:29.56]Put her pride on the hook, she'll take the bait.
[237:33.44]Look, I ain't asking you to be friends with Sakura-chan.
[237:37.00]In fact, you two make much better rivals.
[237:40.72]Rivals?
[237:42.21]Yeah.
[237:43.37]But not the kind that shanks the other in the back.
[237:46.11]Compete.
[237:46.65]Puss each other.
[237:47.85]Get better.
[237:49.09]You'll bring up all the other girls with you.
[237:51.91]Stop the accent.
[237:52.69]What?
[237:53.13]You don't like it?
[237:55.03]You guys don't like the accent?
[237:57.86]You don't like it?
[237:59.02]You don't like it?
[238:00.28]You don't like it?
[238:03.68]Right now, right now, you're just tripping over each other.
[238:07.57]And that makes it harder for everybody around you to step up.
[238:12.25]Customers may love a gal like that, but I got no use for them here.
[238:16.53]The Grand needs girls who are popular with the guys and the girls.
[238:22.54]Guys and the girls?
[238:24.54]Thing is, I know you could be that girl.
[238:29.26]That's the only reason I'm coming down on you about it.
[238:31.51]I like this.
[238:31.93]There, see?
[238:33.81]You do get it.
[238:34.53]I knew you were a keeper.
[238:35.27]I knew you were a keeper, kid.
[238:36.35]Matthew McConaughey.
[238:59.26]Ah, finally.
[238:59.98]Took long enough.
[239:01.72]Shit.
[239:02.22]That way.
[239:05.06]What was that waiter's deal?
[239:06.92]Can't have him zoning out on me like that.
[239:09.70]Better go have a chat.
[239:11.54]This car goes fast.
[239:14.62]But it's safe, too.
[239:15.30]You know what I'm saying?
[239:18.58]When you drive a Lincoln, sophistication is key.
[239:31.78]Okay, cool.
[239:32.24]That worked.
[239:39.32]What else can I do?
[239:39.76]I'm going to talk to this guy.
[239:43.36]Quit while you're ahead.
[239:46.60]What a long face.
[239:47.62]Need to use facilities?
[239:50.87]Sir, no, no.
[239:51.61]I got a letter from my little sister back home.
[239:54.15]Yeah?
[239:55.15]What's the word?
[239:57.66]My father's sick, unfortunately.
[240:00.04]The doc says he needs to be hospitalized, but the procedure they want to do runs 500,000.
[240:04.99]But I ain't got that kind of cash.
[240:07.35]Sorry to hear that.
[240:08.97]You try asking the floor manager for advance?
[240:12.45]Another emergency a while back already forced me to ask for one.
[240:15.76]I'm afraid if I ask again, I'll get canned.
[240:18.14]Especially for so much.
[240:20.64]You in the habit of breaking mirrors, kid?

[241:05.33]Looks like that's it for my staff troubles.
[241:07.57]It's about time I checked in on the hole.
[241:09.65]See what's going on outside.
[241:13.20]I'm going to shut the fuck up.
[241:14.24]Ban that person for a day.
[241:22.18]One of the customers is placing insane orders now that he knows he isn't paying for it.
[241:26.89]He went down the line of our top vintage wines to start, then he started on our best whiskeys and brandies.
[241:34.29]Well, I mean, when you hear the words, this guy's going to pay for every drink, it's like, okay, let's go to the bottom of the wine list.
[241:41.76]Let's turn the page three times.
[241:44.28]We're going to go to the bottom.
[241:48.00]Start at the priciest and work your way down the list, huh?
[241:53.22]Guys, this is the only way he's going to read and comprehend the story.
[241:57.76]Well, somebody gets it, but okay.
[242:00.57]Start at the priciest.
[242:05.81]Shit.
[242:07.11]Now I haven't been paying attention.
[242:09.35]I haven't been paying attention.
[242:10.25]I haven't read anything.
[242:12.55]I haven't comprehended a word.
[242:15.27]Right this way.
[242:23.62]Ah, fine.
[242:24.40]Just do the accent.
[242:25.72]Oh, god damn it.
[242:27.67]We have to dodge this guy too?
[242:54.48]Is everybody such a dick?
[243:19.19]Don't you think you'd be like, oh my God, I'm like doing all this expensive shit.
[243:22.01]Like, yeah, what can I do for you?
[243:23.41]Like, alright, I'll cool it.
[243:25.27]I'll cool it.
[243:25.65]Like, I won't order anymore.
[243:26.65]I'm sorry.
[243:27.19]Like, I've got a little, I got a little ahead of myself.
[243:29.90]I have to be a dick.
[243:36.38]Yes, I understand.
[243:48.78]Now, let's go.
[243:49.96]Sure.
[243:53.32]You're getting better.
[244:06.38]I heard you were crying the other day.
[244:09.66]You'll get better.
[244:14.42]I don't know.
[244:14.78]I thought I was going to microwave the cigarettes.
[244:18.02]I've got to reheat these cigarettes.
[244:19.24]They're getting cold.
[244:22.76]Oh, it's not even a microwave.
[244:24.74]It's a hot towel bin. ...
[244:46.61]You get a raid?
[244:49.94]Who raided?
[244:53.00]Raid?
[244:53.22]I don't see a raid.
[244:54.80]Where?
[244:57.64]Where?
[244:57.84]I don't see one.
[244:59.36]I don't see a raid.
[245:00.25]Who raided?
[245:05.61]Is it a jebait?
[245:07.23]I don't see it anywhere.
[245:15.28]Whoever raided, if you did: what's up? Thanks.
[245:20.45]I don't see it anywhere.
[245:29.45]What just happened?
[245:30.45]Oh.
[245:44.13]You don't think so yourself?
[245:46.73]You're an idiot.
[245:48.89]Who would like to do something like this?
[245:53.42]Well, you don't know how grateful you are for what you're doing now.
[245:57.30]Money, standing fame, you've got all three, which means you're probably drowning in women.
[246:00.56]I don't want that.
[246:07.75]It's ridiculous.
[246:12.65]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:15.40]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:18.74]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:22.88]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:26.65]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:30.39]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:34.97]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:37.03]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:39.54]You're the only one in this town who is jealous of me.
[246:47.57]If you enjoy it, I and the Shimano brothers will be a little troubled.
[246:52.57]Oh, this is punishment.
[246:53.29]Back in the Yakuza.
[246:53.95]I don't know why I want to go back to Gokudo so much.
[246:57.83]I don't know why.
[247:16.94]retainer to the fifth only alliance chairman that was a lot I couldn't read it all you'll have your 100 million by next month
[247:46.08]Okay.
[247:46.58]Another 500 million?
[247:47.40]That's bullshit.
[248:10.54]You weasley rat bastard.
[248:14.32]Oh!
[248:15.48]Nope, can't do that.
[248:17.06]Oh shit.
[248:17.64]I thought he was gonna do it.
[248:22.74]Oh shit.
[248:23.10]Pfft.
[248:39.68]This is the way of the world you want to return to.
[248:42.84]A Yakuza can't just let go of a money thief like you.
[248:49.44]What do you think?
[248:51.84]You'd better take revenge, wouldn't you?
[248:53.28]It's a good deal.
[249:03.49]Whether it's 500 million or not, I'll make as much as I want.
[249:08.69]You're in the same debt pit as Mojima.
[249:11.33]I like Mojima.
[249:11.83]2 billion, 3 billion, 4 billion.
[249:37.91]Add another 500 to the debt.
[249:39.83]Yeah.
[249:41.81]How much are you getting paid to play this game?
[249:47.42]I don't know.
[249:47.82]However much you guys gave me today.
[249:50.38]How about zero?
[250:08.86]Ah, that's right.
[250:09.92]I forgot one thing.
[250:12.14]Noriko is the hostess here, isn't she?
[250:16.30]What about her?
[250:17.06]Yeah, what's the deal?
[250:18.65]I decided to let her do it at a different store from tomorrow.
[250:21.33]Hey, what?
[250:23.85]I want the power of strategy.
[250:26.07]Noriko is the number one, isn't she?
[250:29.19]They're separating us.
[250:31.53]I've already told the owner, so please take care of this one.
[250:35.80]I'll do my best not to lose sales.
[250:38.61]That's not good.
[251:01.34]Pardon me, sir.
[251:03.06]I just got a call from Ruriko-chan saying she's jumping ship to a different club.
[251:08.50]But what should we do now?
[251:36.53]Okay, tell the mob about it.
[251:38.51]Who's the hottest hostess in town that we don't already have?
[251:41.59]Nozomi-chan from Odyssey is the clear winner.
[251:45.57]She's a big part of why they're the strongest rival.
[251:51.76]I see.
[252:00.63]Yeah?
[252:01.93]Well then, guess I'll be heading out.
[252:05.87]Not too soon, though.
[252:07.91]Soon enough.
[252:10.32]See you around, kid.
[252:12.86]I'm gonna be poaching Nozomi to come to our floor.
[252:27.32]Nightlife biz is a jungle.
[252:28.58]Strong eat the weak.
[252:31.32]We trip.
[252:32.66]And the grand will come crumbling down in days.
[252:34.96]My job is to do what it takes.
[252:38.22]Can you run back to prompting?
[252:43.90]I'll get it again, don't worry.
[252:45.10]I promise.
[252:49.42]Alright, we gotta go get that other girl to come over here and be at our hotel.
[252:58.08]Netflix dub.
[252:59.12]Do karaoke?
[253:09.01]I did karaoke.
[253:09.65]I want to go check out the town.
[253:10.63]Do I have access to the town now?
[253:15.35]You know what a cabaret is?
[253:16.29]Yeah.
[253:30.65]It's a, um... It's like a performance.
[253:34.27]It's a short performance of music and theater and dance.
[253:38.53]Like a bunch of dancing and singing and performances.
[253:40.53]Go to Odyssey.
[253:44.87]Ooh, okay, we have a town here.
[253:46.55]Oh, look at this.
[253:48.65]Okay, what's this?
[253:49.87]Shot Bar.
[253:51.41]Bart with darts and pool.
[253:54.93]There's the cabaret.
[253:55.75]There's... Oh, and the arcade.
[254:00.91]Alright, we'll go to the Barsford Darts' pool.
[254:04.04]At the end.
[254:07.50]You there!
[254:08.86]Huh?
[254:16.94]You are the master of that alehouse, the Grand, yes?
[254:20.55]Yeah, that's me.
[254:22.11]I knew it!
[254:23.27]Even the way you walk is refined.
[254:24.93]Guarded.
[254:25.33]You have no blind spot, despite appearances.
[254:29.10]I'm sorry sir, have we met before?
[254:31.84]My name is Somotaro Kumike, heir to a certain form of martial arts in its present master.
[254:38.03]Martial arts?
[254:39.99]Yes, but lately I've felt my technique slipping.
[254:42.97]My edge has been dulled, so I left the lights of Tokyo in order to train.
[254:47.97]Yet even here I find this age of excess, gluttons and fools gorging on carnal pleasures.
[254:53.71]Nobody hungers anymore.
[254:56.14]Then I heard talk of a lounge called the Grand.
[254:58.96]They said it was the home of a most interesting man.
[255:03.68]Pardon my asking, but have you visited our establishment before?
[255:07.32]What kind of question is that?
[255:10.28]Guzzling booze with painted ladies hanging all over you?
[255:12.72]Bah!
[255:13.72]Wanted excess.
[255:14.94]Of course I haven't been there.
[255:18.78]Well, then why the hell am I doing a song and dance if you ain't accustomed?
[255:22.74]Besides, that's a washed-up martial artist's one with me.
[255:28.08]hungry air about you.
[255:29.80]It is far beyond the men I've fought in recent years.
[255:32.63]Would you do me the honor?
[255:35.57]What honor would that be?
[255:37.37]Want me to fight you?
[255:39.27]Precisely.
[255:40.33]A deeper strength sleeps within you.
[255:42.83]I refuse to let it lie dormant and unused any longer.
[255:46.03]You okay upstairs, pal?
[255:48.92]Fighting you don't earn me skinny hands, profit.
[255:52.88]I'm a busy gal.
[255:54.90]A busy guy.
[255:56.58]I'd behind your merchants, guys, all you like.
[255:59.09]I know money isn't what feeds that hunger.
[256:01.45]Whatever honest life you make, a show of living, I can see the demon gnawing at you inside.
[256:08.43]There's only one way to appease the demon, son.
[256:11.15]Face the strong in combat and set loose those fighting instincts struggling to burst free.
[256:16.86]And you're telling me you're that strong guy?
[256:20.41]As it happens, I am.
[256:21.97]Now do you see a reason to face me?
[256:24.09]Not that it will stay any... It won't be very easy for you.
[256:26.81]There's no talking sense to you, is there?
[256:31.48]Fine.
[256:32.34]You win.
[256:33.68]I was just thinking it'd been a while since I really cut loose.
[256:36.98]Not here, though.
[256:37.74]Somewhere else.
[256:38.58]Somewhere else.
[256:39.10]Not here.
[256:40.74]Hmm, if you insist.
[256:44.01]Who talks like that?
[256:44.87]Me!
[256:53.80]This place should work.
[256:55.80]You are awfully... It's a different guy.
[256:57.84]You are... It's the same person.
[256:59.10]You are awfully unhesitant to agree... I wasn't paying attention.
[257:02.10]In agreeing to this, I am starting to think you keep the true extent of your strength hidden away.
[257:06.58]You must have your reasons.
[257:07.54]I know I have mine.
[257:10.81]Well, the fist is like the sword.
[257:12.67]Leave it in its sheath to rust, and you will not be able to draw it when it is needed.
[257:17.33]What say you?
[257:18.59]Ever feel an urge to shrug off your restraints and fight to the full extent of your abilities for a change?
[257:22.89]Oh.
[257:24.84]You're offering a ump game.
[257:27.34]Not too big on the idea of opening up the can of a creaky old guy like you.
[257:31.28]Though.
[257:31.50]Fuck.
[257:39.17]Oh, cast aside such worries.
[257:40.71]Even Donald to the edge left in me should prove sufficient to handle a pup like you.
[257:44.23]Show me everything you've got.
[257:47.71]He's throwing.
[257:48.37]Alright, I'm done.
[257:53.58]Thug style incorporates a number of merciless attacks.
[257:55.80]One of these is the eye poke You land an eye poke attack.
[257:59.84]The enemy will turn their back to you in pain Eye poke?
[258:14.19]Holy shit, I just dropped him
[258:20.30]One of the special moves of the thug style is a heat action called the Essence of Choking.
[258:24.94]This heat action triggers when an enemy attacks you or when you just circle behind them.
[258:29.46]Okay.
[258:31.73]The heat gauge at third press Y when an enemy attacks.
[258:34.47]Yeah, we've seen this.
[258:39.37]Oh my god, I just broke that fucking old dude's neck.
[258:51.31]Defeat him.
[258:52.45]And run at me, run at me.
[258:53.29]Come on, come get me.
[258:55.07]I'll snap his neck.
[259:02.03]The essence of murder.
[259:05.24]Holy shit!
[259:21.31]Dropping frames?
[259:22.58]Am I?
[259:25.62]Oh, I did drop some.
[259:32.40]We good?
[259:36.07]Yeah, the internet's been a little weird here the last couple of nights.
[259:41.57]I've had like small internet hiccups over the last like maybe two nights.
[259:53.93]No, it should be good.
[260:03.01]I mean, I haven't had internet problems in like a year.
[260:05.78]I mean, I'm on fiber.
[260:07.58]I have a thousand thousand, but sometimes I'm sure it can happen.
[260:13.08]I don't have my VPN on right now.
[260:24.96]But yeah, the last two nights, after like 8 o'clock at night for some reason, it's gotten a little weird.
[260:30.96]I'll give him a call.
[260:33.87]See if anything's going on.
[260:48.43]Is it still dropping frames?
[260:51.90]Oh, it is, yeah.
[260:53.04]Hmm.
[260:55.73]Oh, shit, it is.
[260:56.25]Yeah, it is happening.
[260:57.59]Hmm.
[261:00.57]They might be doing, like, maintenance or something the last few nights.
[261:05.05]Because it's been, like, the same time every night.
[261:07.66]Hmm.
[261:10.40]I'll give him a call.
[261:11.36]See what's going on.
[261:19.47]Yeah, it's been like eight months since there's been any internet problems.
[261:21.93]It's been perfect.
[261:22.47]I've had almost zero problems at all.
[261:25.93]But yeah, I'm definitely dropping a shitload of frames so I can see it.
[261:27.96]Hold on one sec.
[261:44.38]Let me just see what happens when I do this.
[261:48.72]Let's find out.
[261:52.37]Sorry about that.
[261:59.11]They're trying to block Majima.
[262:07.49]Yeah, this is the second night in a row.
[262:10.23]Oh, yeah.
[262:10.55]No, this is bad.
[262:11.09]This is really bad.
[262:13.97]This is terrible.
[262:15.09]Terrible, terrible.
[262:15.97]Okay, I'm getting like 8 megabits down.
[262:19.81]And I have 1,000 down.
[262:22.31]Literally like an hour ago, this was 1,000.
[262:23.87]Oh yeah, this is not good.
[262:27.05]Something's wrong.
[262:29.03]I think they're doing maintenance or something.
[262:41.86]Your VPN?
[262:42.48]I don't have a VPN turned on right now.
[262:47.54]Facecam react.
[262:53.48]It's been the exact same time two days in a row.
[263:00.37]I think it looks like it's evening out a little bit.
[263:02.55]Sorry about that.
[263:03.23]It's going to be like that probably till I end.
[263:05.73]Alright, dude, come at me.
[263:18.64]Do I have a private line?
[263:19.40]Well, fiber is... It's fiber.
[263:22.71]I don't have... The way that fiber works, you're not... You don't share it.
[263:34.81]It's not cable.
[263:39.11]So that's why, like, when something like this happens, it's like they're doing something.
[263:53.41]I was on, remember, if you remember a year or two ago, a couple of years ago, I was on cable.
[263:56.54]I've been on cable forever.
[264:02.84]You still share the line though?
[264:05.18]From my understanding, don't you, you don't share like a node with like a fiber optic with actual fiber line.
[264:12.27]Like a true fiber connection, fiber like to the house is not like a shared line with your neighborhood.
[264:28.51]Still happening.
[264:36.77]Oh, no.
[264:37.72]I'll do karaoke.
[264:38.40]Is it good now?
[264:41.44]It's better.
[264:42.02]Okay.
[264:42.14]Alright.
[264:43.82]I'm going to do.
[264:44.62]I want to do.
[264:49.19]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[264:50.25]Let's go.
[265:09.42]At Mahjong Jambalaya, you can play at tables with varying rates or participate in ranked matches.
[265:15.26]The tables are beginning, low, right, intermediate, high, advanced, and high.
[265:19.55]The price to play and the strength of the opponents vary depending on the table.
[265:22.91]Ooh, alright, let's go.
[265:23.87]Let's go, let's go, let's go.
[265:25.03]Let's go.
[265:25.63]Let's go.
[265:25.89]Oh, I don't have any money.
[265:28.27]Do I have any money?
[265:28.71]I don't have any money.
[265:31.65]Sorry.
[265:31.83]I don't have any money.
[265:32.47]Ahem.
[265:39.44]Going to the casino.
[265:40.37]Alright.
[265:40.65]I'm ready to play at the casino.
[265:42.75]Okay, sir.
[265:43.27]What's your bet?
[265:44.07]I don't have any money.
[265:44.87]I just wanted to come in and play.
[265:49.32]What's over here?
[265:49.80]This is Mahjong.
[265:52.08]Starts.
[266:09.44]What?
[266:09.96]Did you just stop me?
[266:10.80]Don't stop me.
[266:11.42]I want to go play darts.
[266:17.64]What can I get you?

[267:50.01]I had a lot of fun, though.
[267:51.01]I'm going to play it again.

[267:56.93]I'm like, okay, when I come back tomorrow, we're going to have so much fun.
[268:00.26]Maybe I shouldn't have done so many of those throat things where the sound comes out.
[268:07.82]If I'm not live tomorrow, I'll see you guys the day after that, which would be Saturday.
[268:12.53]So plan on Saturday.
