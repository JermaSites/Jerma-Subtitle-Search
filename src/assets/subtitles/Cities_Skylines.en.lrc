[00:00.98]Hey, yeah, I know.
[00:01.76]I know I'm late.
[00:02.46]I know I'm late.
[00:03.12]Don't make fun of me.
[00:04.52]Don't make fun of me.
[00:05.29]Don't make fun of me.
[00:06.21]Don't make fun of me.
[00:06.89]Don't make, don't make, don't make fun of me.
[00:10.03]Please.
[00:10.31]Okay.
[00:19.57]Hey, how are you?
[00:20.47]Good to see you again.
[00:21.15]Hope you're having a good afternoon.
[00:28.20]Today, we're going to play Cities Skylines.
[00:34.95]I downloaded the Nvidia graphics card update.
[00:40.05]I decided to pick the day to install the new Nvidia driver update.
[00:45.69]To play Cities Skylines, which I didn't fucking even need it.
[00:49.64]And my computer wouldn't post to Windows for about 20 minutes.
[00:53.34]So I had to hard boot my computer and
[00:57.63]And that's why I'm late!
[00:59.17]That's why I'm not here, like, 20 minutes ago!
[01:01.69]I- I... Come on!
[01:08.37]That's the reason!
[01:09.72]I don't know why, I fucking looked at it too, and I was sitting there going, Oh, hey, you know, there's an Nvidia graphics card update.
[01:15.40]I'm like, oh, alright, yeah.
[01:17.74]What am I playing today?
[01:18.54]City Sky.
[01:19.06]This game came out in, like, 2012.
[01:21.78]I need that update right now.
[01:23.00]Yeah, sure, get it.
[01:27.28]Anyways, I can hear myself talk again, which is irritating.
[01:30.05]There we go.
[01:32.27]Let me get rid of this.
[01:35.15]There.
[01:36.97]So yeah, we're going to play City Skylines.
[01:38.83]I've been talking about this for about, I don't know, maybe a week or two.
[01:42.83]On a whim, somebody brought it up.
[01:44.75]Hey, you should do City Skylines on Friday.
[01:47.67]Yeah.
[01:48.41]Okay.
[01:49.61]That's what we're doing.
[01:51.27]There are no mods.
[01:54.65]All I did was purchase...
[01:57.84]Every single fucking DLC in the game.
[02:01.50]I just, I freaked out.
[02:02.58]I kind of panicked a little bit.
[02:04.04]As you can see.
[02:04.62]As you can see.
[02:07.58]I got Campus Radio.
[02:12.15]Downtown Radio.
[02:13.51]I didn't know if I needed any of this stuff.
[02:16.57]I just, I bought the whole thing.
[02:17.67]I just was like, should I get it all?
[02:18.87]Does this matter?
[02:19.45]Oh, you can't even hear it.
[02:24.70]Hold on.
[02:24.98]There you go.
[02:29.59]You need camp.
[02:30.75]Alright.
[02:31.09]Well, here's the thing.
[02:32.23]I'm gonna be very real with you guys.
[02:35.05]I... I don't know anything about this game.
[02:39.69]I've never opened it.
[02:42.04]I've never pressed jump one time in City Super Mario Skylines.
[02:47.92]I have to do the tutorial.
[02:49.32]This is gonna... We're just gonna relax and just chill and I'm gonna play this fucking game.
[02:54.68]I... I don't know.
[02:57.04]You know what I'm saying?
[02:57.67]I just... I don't know what I'm doing.
[03:02.95]Oh, I can't skip the tutorial.
[03:06.21]That was a terrible... What joke?
[03:08.07]I made a joke?
[03:11.01]When?
[03:11.57]What?
[03:12.69]Didn't I just tell you what I was doing?
[03:14.15]What did I say?
[03:18.57]There is no tutorial.
[03:24.35]Are you ready?
[03:26.03]Am I ready?
[03:28.60]Campus Radio is an OST.
[03:31.66]What about this?
[03:37.04]Rock City Jazz City.
[03:39.34]How much was all this?
[03:42.27]Rock City Radio.
[03:46.05]Concerts?
[03:47.29]Did I buy like a concert ticket?
[03:52.22]Was this like $40 for the music?
[03:54.98]Oh my god.
[03:57.96]Whatever.
[03:58.86]I'll listen to it.
[03:59.58]We're gonna put it on a principle.
[04:01.22]Alright, here we go.
[04:01.66]New game.
[04:03.46]Choose a map, choose a scenario.
[04:05.07]Uh... Is there like a here's how to play the game, sir?
[04:14.70]Choose map.
[04:16.72]Green Peaks.
[04:19.76]Why am I not playing Animal Crossing?
[04:23.05]Eh.
[04:24.07]I'll do that later.
[04:24.95]I'll do that later.
[04:25.49]This was more interesting to me right this second.
[04:28.09]We'll do that like in a couple days.
[04:29.42]We'll do that like, I don't know, like Sunday or something.
[04:31.34]I don't know.
[04:34.66]No, it's not like I don't like animals.
[04:36.40]I just thought, it's like, yeah, whatever.
[04:37.86]I wanted to do this.
[04:39.54]I'm gonna play it.
[04:40.08]Alright, what should I do?
[04:43.38]Choose scenario.
[04:45.16]This scenario is all about making the small industrial city of Peachtree's economy.
[04:49.36]Is it gonna tell me how to play?
[04:53.00]I'm just gonna do Marin Bay.
[04:56.70]Choose scenario.
[05:00.64]Yes, just pick a map.
[05:01.58]I'm just gonna do, I'm gonna do, uh, this one.
[05:04.02]No.
[05:04.58]This one.
[05:05.22]The Peninsula.
[05:10.23]You want to set random disasters on.
[05:11.71]The setting is global.
[05:12.59]Yeah, sure.
[05:13.07]What does that mean?
[05:21.79]Meteors?
[05:25.13]This is like a, like, Sim Earth, right?
[05:27.15]So, like, a fucking- the sun can explode or something, right?
[05:30.87]Is that real?
[05:37.44]What?
[05:37.60]Hold on, what do you mean dinosaurs?
[05:42.88]How is dinosaurs a natural disaster?
[05:46.98]Your town can get attacked by fucking 17 million BC prehistoric animals.
[05:53.97]Oh.
[05:58.48]It's pretty, alright.
[06:00.68]Welcome to City Sky.
[06:01.84]Hey, let's start by building some roads and zoning the areas next to them.
[06:06.22]Buildings will spawn on the zoned areas and you will unlock new city services and buildings as your city grows.
[06:10.98]Okay.
[06:12.18]We need to build some buildings.
[06:13.17]We need to start by building some roads.
[06:16.83]And zoning the areas next to them.
[06:19.51]Okay.
[06:20.93]Cool.
[06:21.07]Cool.
[06:25.40]Oh, how do I?
[06:25.86]Okay, WASD moves around.
[06:27.97]So here's a road.
[06:28.91]Oh, it's just like Rollercoaster Tycoon 3!
[06:31.77]Okay.
[06:32.41]Click on the question mark button and it'll probably be with you.
[06:33.99]Sure.
[06:34.49]Alright, let's put some roads.
[06:40.46]How do I put, like, the park thing here?
[06:41.68]How much does it cost to come into my park?
[06:49.92]road alright here we go roads need to be built to provide zones for buildings and city services larger roads allow faster travel and greater amounts of traffic and big roads both with decoration produce less noise pollution I need decorations on the roads that's probably cost more money I'm not doing that use page up and page down to build elevated roads or tunnels you need tunnels
[07:18.13]Draw a road over water to build a bridge.
[07:19.91]Did you just draw it?
[07:23.51]No, no, no.
[07:25.05]I'm not pausing the game to look at a picture right now.
[07:27.55]Because I need to learn how to play Cities Skylines.
[07:31.67]I know.
[07:33.07]You may have made my mouth three times bigger and stretched my nose up into my eyes.
[07:38.05]And gave my eyebrow bone 5% more density.
[07:41.38]I know.
[07:42.14]I already know what the image is.
[07:44.39]So, can I just learn how to play Cities Skylines?
[07:47.03]We're gonna be here all day.
[07:48.87]I promise.
[07:50.09]No, you paused... I'm not pa- I don't- I'm not pausing the game to look at an image.
[07:58.98]Okay.
[07:59.86]To change... Wait.
[08:03.82]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[08:04.48]You're talking about in the game.
[08:06.50]Oh.
[08:08.62]Alright.
[08:11.54]I thought you guys were telling me to- Whatever.
[08:13.07]Whatever.
[08:14.73]It's not you, you're an egomaniac.
[08:16.77]Alright, pause the fucking game.
[08:19.53]I'm in the middle of the tutorial!
[08:21.15]Can I not just do the tutorial first?
[08:26.34]City Skylines Collection Bundle.
[08:32.72]What about this?
[08:33.30]What are you talking about?
[08:34.44]I have to save 9%?
[08:35.58]How much did I pay for this?
[08:37.10]Wait.
[08:41.00]The price.
[08:44.22]I know, no, no, no, but hold on a second.
[08:45.70]This is important.
[08:47.24]I didn't buy the bundle.
[08:48.80]I bought the DLC individually through, like, the DLC page.
[08:53.10]Did I do that?
[08:53.74]Yeah, I did.
[08:58.74]Let me see if I actually just, like, lost out on, like, fucking $40 or something.
[09:04.76]Let me see.
[09:05.16]This is important.
[09:05.84]This is actually important.
[09:07.04]Hold on.
[09:10.10]Where's my, like, purchase history?
[09:14.93]activity Yeah, I bought them all individually, but I thought the bundle was like other games or something oh No, how much did this cost?
[09:29.89]Hold on let me go to Steam support and find out I scammed myself
[09:42.17]Hold on.
[09:42.99]Let me see.
[09:43.61]View purchase history.
[09:46.82]No, no, it's alright.
[09:48.08]It's okay.
[09:49.70]It was still the same.
[09:50.34]Wait, $179.
[09:50.78]That's so much fucking money.
[09:55.56]How much was it?
[09:57.13]How much was the bundle?
[10:00.19]How much was the bundle?
[10:01.03]Did I save money?
[10:02.15]Wait, wait, wait.
[10:05.69]Hold on a second.
[10:06.43]I think I may have deleted...
[10:09.54]Yeah, alright, I know what happened here.
[10:11.22]So I individually bought all the DLCs, but I removed, like, one or two, I think, soundtracks, and one, like, content creator pack.
[10:22.37]I was like, I don't fucking want this.
[10:24.63]It had, like, really bad reviews.
[10:26.43]So I deleted it.
[10:27.23]So I think I actually did got- I got scammed.
[10:30.15]Most important one.
[10:34.81]So, you know, I did get scammed.
[10:36.95]Alright, that's fine.
[10:38.29]That's fine.
[10:38.83]That's alright.
[10:39.45]This is fine.
[10:42.79]So, pound for pound, I got scammed.
[10:45.19]You only needed the expansions.
[10:48.12]I don't know.
[10:48.64]Dude, this is like Train Simulator.
[10:50.54]It's like The Sims.
[10:53.82]I don't know what the fuck I needed, I just bought all of them!
[10:56.32]Because, like, what if I- Here's the scenario.
[10:58.73]If I didn't buy every single pack, and I got to a point in the game, like, a few hours from now, like, let's say 10 hours from now, like, over the next day or two, and I don't have the dinosaur invasion, you guys are gonna fucking be so annoyed!
[11:12.58]Wait, hold on, he doesn't have, like, the- he doesn't have, like, tree- Wait, wait, wait, the streamer doesn't have tree 18?!
[11:20.00]I- No, I don't.
[11:21.24]Oh, how could you not get tree 18 pack?! !
[11:24.15]I got it all!
[11:31.17]Where's the music?
[11:32.09]I want to play the music I purchased.
[11:35.33]Let me learn how to play the game!
[11:37.11]Alright, enough.
[11:38.70]Let me learn how to- I need to learn how to play the game.
[11:41.76]We're literally at the bottom end of the popsicle sticks for the double popsicle.
[11:46.06]Which, I mean, I wish I had those.
[11:48.82]Do they even still make those?
[11:50.40]The split popsicles?
[11:51.48]I fucking want one now.
[11:53.41]Alright.
[11:54.64]How do I play?
[11:55.66]Make a road.
[11:56.16]You guys just fucking threw me off.
[11:57.66]I'm not even past the second bubble of how to make a road.
[12:00.88]It's been 13 minutes.
[12:03.70]I need everybody to relax.
[12:07.54]Okay.
[12:08.58]How to make a road.
[12:09.92]Where's my road bubble?
[12:10.87]Okay.
[12:13.01]Roads need to be built to provide zones for you and city services.
[12:15.55]Larger roads allow faster travel, so just have a bunch of huge roads.
[12:20.29]He's molding already.
[12:21.41]I'm not.
[12:22.33]No, I'm not.
[12:23.26]I'm just slightly agitated.
[12:28.84]Alright, roads and decorations have less noise pollution.
[12:31.04]People like it.
[12:32.68]Okay, page up, page down.
[12:33.56]Does it go up and down?
[12:35.36]Over a river for a river.
[12:37.23]Change the road's type.
[12:38.41]Try the upgrading tool.
[12:40.55]Use a road type.
[12:44.17]And just click on an existing road.
[12:46.52]Click on a one-way road with secondary mouse button to change its direction.
[12:50.68]Use upgrade tool to fix destroyed road.
[12:52.20]Alright, where's the upgrade tool?
[12:54.06]Road construction, intersections, medium roads.
[12:58.13]What's the upgrade tool?
[13:01.59]Road toll tools.
[13:09.28]This is locked.
[13:12.40]Toggle snapping.
[13:13.56]This is upgrade to us.
[13:14.88]Are there?
[13:15.22]Okay.
[13:15.50]Upgrade road.
[13:16.22]I want to make sure I know where it is.
[13:19.67]Alright, so.
[13:20.05]You can change the road's type.
[13:24.33]So these are one-way roads.
[13:26.33]I guess.
[13:26.59]This is coming into the city.
[13:29.47]Toll booths must be connected to road in order to operate.
[13:32.49]All traffic driving through the toll must slow down at the booths and pay a fee to pass the toll.
[13:36.92]So this is when they come into the park.
[13:39.40]Fair price can be adjusted.
[13:41.02]Okay, so I want a toll booth right at the beginning of the town.
[13:44.67]So this is like how you pay to get into the theme park.
[13:46.93]Alright, here we go.
[13:49.55]This is just a regular road, right?
[13:51.23]Two lane road.
[13:57.34]Pog.
[13:59.88]That's a fucking pog right there.
[14:03.90]Okay.
[14:04.76]Nice.
[14:05.04]Alright, so now I'm gonna do what, like, 95% of all of us on this website do, is after I do 1% of progress, I'm gonna stop for a little bit, and we're gonna talk about something.
[14:15.31]Maybe the progress of the game, or potentially something completely unrelated.
[14:19.29]It'll take me about three to four hours to build this road a mile up into the city.
[14:26.06]What'd you guys have for dinner last night?
[14:27.84]I had a fucking spaghetti.
[14:31.18]Wait, shouldn't this be...
[14:33.35]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[14:34.01]I want more than... How do I make more than one lane?
[14:37.85]Upgrade tool.
[14:40.32]Cannot upgrade this type.
[14:42.02]Why the fuck not?
[14:45.64]Oh, me... Oh, shit.
[14:46.80]Okay, large roads.
[14:47.84]Right, I need to... This is... What a bottleneck.
[14:52.32]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[14:53.50]I need to make this bigger.
[14:56.24]Wait, what?
[14:57.57]Wait, why?
[14:59.43]How many lanes is this?
[15:00.63]Is this two lanes?
[15:03.17]Six lanes?
[15:07.11]Okay.
[15:07.99]It's okay.
[15:08.57]It's alright.
[15:10.27]I need a... whatever.
[15:11.49]Six lanes of road.
[15:15.99]I need to have a city go this way.
[15:18.68]Do I not have enough money?
[15:21.68]How much does this cost?
[15:25.36]Oh, it's an upgrade tool.
[15:26.34]Okay.
[15:28.88]Take the upgrade tool off.
[15:31.44]Straight road.
[15:31.94]Okay, here we go.
[15:40.74]How do I tilt it?
[15:50.37]Middle click?
[15:51.53]Oh.
[15:53.35]What?
[15:53.79]Middle click doesn't do anything.
[15:55.13]I'll take the snapping off a huge fucking road.
[16:01.14]Angle.
[16:01.78]Okay.
[16:02.82]Road length grid.
[16:03.84]So if I go like this, how do I tilt it?
[16:06.32]I have to use this?
[16:08.04]Freeform road.
[16:08.80]Here we go.
[16:10.73]Alright, get off.
[16:12.49]Make only road.
[16:13.71]Build 5 GTA.
[16:14.33]I gotta figure out how to play.
[16:15.38]This is not a great tutorial, by the way.
[16:19.72]Okay, how do I get to, like, how do I build a fucking road?
[16:29.38]To the left of you?
[16:37.51]Alright.
[16:38.75]Ah!
[16:38.89]Look at that.
[16:39.39]Okay, cool.
[16:42.47]This is so fucking ugly.
[16:43.59]Alright, so how much does this cost?
[16:45.71]Okay.
[16:46.39]Alright, this is a highway.
[16:52.89]So we're gonna have the highway go... We're gonna have an exit off the highway.
[17:03.28]Wait, this is a highway, yeah.
[17:05.80]Okay.
[17:08.63]Thanks for telling me how to play.
[17:10.13]Oh, wait, maybe that... What's the tweet say?
[17:13.27]Hello, this is Chirper.
[17:14.71]Keep an eye on what your citizens are talking about and what's happening around the world.
[17:19.20]Fuck you.
[17:20.70]Well, thanks, Chirper.
[17:23.62]How do I build fucking roads?
[17:28.58]Okay, why are you telling me how to build a toll booth?
[17:38.98]Oh, should I have 55?
[17:39.72]Okay, wait, wait.
[17:40.24]I gotta go back to the small.
[17:41.24]Okay, now we're gonna do... How do I pick, like, an... How do I zone this shit?
[17:48.25]Zoning.
[17:50.19]I didn't... What the fuck?
[17:51.03]How am I supposed to know what the fuck this was?
[17:53.05]Zones determine what kinds of buildings will spawn to the areas next to the roads.
[17:59.67]Areas indicated by gray grid next to roads can be zoned using zoning tools.
[18:03.53]Okay.
[18:04.69]Why is there horror movie music playing?
[18:11.26]There are four different tools for zoning.
[18:12.98]Fill, marquee, and small and large.
[18:16.28]Zone an area by clicking the primary mouse button on it.
[18:19.28]Hold down the mouse button to adjust the square marquee size or continue to paint with a brush, alright?
[18:24.80]Residential zones are for houses for citizens.
[18:28.24]Commercial zones are for shopping and leisure.
[18:31.28]industry and office zones provide jobs for the citizens and produce goods for the commercial zones to sell so commercial zones industrial zones this is jobs and producing goods for local businesses uh this is uh his own which is just another way to say the zone I guess in a cool way uh okay so uh this is our city I'm just learning
[19:02.59]So let's make some houses, I guess.
[19:04.45]Let's have... No, no, no, no.
[19:05.86]This is our highway.
[19:06.66]I'm fucking learning.
[19:07.88]Hold on.
[19:08.38]This is just a trial run.
[19:11.32]So I want this to turn... Alright, so you come in, you pay the entrance fee to the park.
[19:17.14]Right to the right is gonna be the carousel.
[19:19.96]It's every fucking person that's ever played this game has had the carousel right here.
[19:24.41]No one has ever played this game without a fucking carousel being right fucking here every single time.
[19:31.13]Doesn't matter who it is.
[19:31.83]It could be you, your parents, your father, your mother, your friend.
[19:36.77]Doesn't matter who it is.
[19:40.80]Hey, I built like two fucking centimeters of road.
[19:44.10]Let's talk for a little bit.
[19:44.96]Welcome to Twitch.
[19:47.55]The thing I made fun of.
[19:48.63]It's going to happen.
[19:49.53]That's what I do.
[19:50.73]Whatever.
[19:59.11]I'm just trying to see how the fuck this works.
[20:04.70]Okay, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[20:06.90]Is it... How many lanes is this?
[20:08.48]Alright, here's an intersection.
[20:09.34]Do you have to put stoplights so people can drive into each other?
[20:12.22]Okay, so, you go... Okay, cool.
[20:27.20]So, let me just put houses here.
[20:32.68]Alright, let's zone it for housing.
[20:34.96]So this is like you come down here and this is the first street.
[20:37.39]This is FIRST street.
[20:39.89]This is residential.
[20:43.35]Can I just drag across?
[20:44.71]Do I have to click individually?
[20:46.01]Okay, so here's residential.
[20:52.20]Terrible city planning.
[20:55.04]Sorry.
[20:56.86]Sorry!
[20:59.33]YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO WHEN YOU TOLD ME TO PLAY CITY SKYLINES.
[21:02.10]YOU KNEW WHAT YOU WERE GETTING INTO.
[21:04.80]OF JUST BEING COMPLETELY UP FRONT.
[21:09.70]Okay.
[21:10.52]So, I made zoning for houses.
[21:12.06]So how do you make houses?
[21:15.78]I sure wish the fucking Twitter ripoff would help me.
[21:19.19]Okay, what's this?
[21:20.23]Um, it's zoned for houses.
[21:21.65]What's this?
[21:23.61]Oh, you can pick the mark.
[21:24.41]Okay, you can drag.
[21:26.74]Um... What is, like, the build tool?
[21:36.54]Well, this is just an ad.
[21:40.04]The game is paused.
[21:42.89]What?
[21:44.87]So what?
[21:46.45]Wait, I need tutorials for the... I have to unpause the game?
[21:49.05]They build themselves?
[21:50.45]What do you mean they build themselves?
[21:56.29]What?
[22:00.86]Wait, I don't have to go down?
[22:01.96]Wait, they're building themselves.
[22:03.68]What?
[22:10.13]So this is like a... Is this like a... What?
[22:12.61]This is like bacteria?
[22:15.07]They just build?
[22:16.17]Oh, okay.
[22:18.89]Alright, alright.
[22:19.37]So now... We need commercial... This is one street.
[22:22.92]This street's gonna go over here.
[22:27.32]This is going to lead into a shopping mall.
[22:32.40]Okay, hold on.
[22:38.53]You literally never played a city builder before.
[22:41.43]No, I haven't.
[22:42.85]Why would I have ever done that?
[22:44.83]We're going to have another city over here.
[22:47.51]Connecting to here.
[22:48.29]Oh, I want snapping on.
[22:56.95]What does it say?
[22:57.49]Space what?
[23:02.51]I told you, idiots.
[23:03.53]He's gonna get so lost.
[23:05.05]Space is already... Oh, it's because of... I told you.
[23:09.96]Don't use freeform?
[23:14.14]Straight road.
[23:15.30]Curved road.
[23:17.30]Freeform.
[23:17.72]Alright, so I want... Curved road, and I want it to snap.
[23:23.70]Angle.
[23:24.68]Road length.
[23:25.60]So, all of it, right?
[23:27.96]So I can't... You need water and power.
[23:31.27]God.
[23:32.69]Water.
[23:34.75]Water available.
[23:37.95]Human replicants.
[23:39.37]Excellent for physical labor.
[23:40.51]Tyrell Corporation.
[23:42.59]Thanks for the fucking promoted tweet.
[23:44.58]I wish I could delete those.
[23:45.82]Alright, wait.
[23:46.72]Pause the game.
[23:47.32]Pause the game.
[23:51.53]Connect the water pumps and- I love how it just assumes I know what that is.
[23:55.81]Hey, connect the water pumps.
[23:57.05]You need like a fucking giant arrow, just like a huge red arrow, just circling this a hundred times for people like me.
[24:05.46]Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes.
[24:09.56]Draw the water pipes under your city to provide buildings- Wait, really?
[24:13.12]So... Small buildings.
[24:17.57]So that I- This is under the ground.
[24:20.43]Okay, cool.
[24:24.66]Note that the water pumps and drains need electricity to work.
[24:27.64]Water tanks store excess water and supply the city automatically.
[24:31.76]Make sure your water pumps are located a safe distance away from any drain pipes to prevent people from using contaminated water.
[24:40.89]Okay.
[24:45.69]Sorry, I'm just chewing on ice.
[24:46.99]That means I have an iron deficiency.
[24:48.39]Fuck.
[24:49.93]During the winter, heating is required.
[24:51.81]Upgraded water pipes carry heat to buildings.
[24:56.63]Make sure your water pumps are located a safe distance away from any drain pipes.
[25:01.27]I- I don't- I- What?
[25:04.05]Do I have to connect every house?
[25:06.07]Or does it not matter?
[25:07.87]Can I just go like this?
[25:13.27]Is this wor- Is this working?
[25:15.21]Do I just have to go- That circle means that it's working, right?
[25:17.95]Okay.
[25:21.13]And then... Connect the water pumps and drains with water pipes.
[25:27.74]Okay, so now I need a... Water pump?
[25:32.16]Water pumping station.
[25:36.05]Does this work?
[25:39.01]Oh, this makes a sh- Oh, these- This is right in this person's backyard.
[25:46.61]Hmm, I'm looking at Zillow right now.
[25:48.59]This house is 215,000.
[25:49.73]This one's 220,000.
[25:50.17]Honey, look at this one.
[25:51.35]This one looks like a deal.
[25:52.40]Why is this one $41,000?
[25:53.28]This looks like a great deal.
[25:54.18]In the water source.
[25:54.58]Oh wait, it has to be... This is fucking million miles away.
[26:15.46]This is so far away, this is so far away.
[26:18.65]I have to, what?
[26:21.43]Okay, so it has to be connected to the water?
[26:23.41]Alright, how many of these should I have?
[26:26.83]120,000 M3s a week.
[26:27.99]Water consumption, 1,300 M3s a week.
[26:38.13]I got plenty.
[26:39.05]All I need is one.
[26:40.49]Alright, now... Water drain pipe.
[26:43.80]The water drain pipe pumps out water waste.
[26:45.62]Remember to avoid pumping sewage upstream.
[26:50.14]Note that the drain pipe always requires a water pumping station to work properly.
[26:54.26]Road connection not required.
[26:56.95]So I need to pump this.
[26:58.85]Like, this way.
[27:01.03]Which way is it going?
[27:01.61]Which way is down river?
[27:02.59]This way?
[27:02.99]It's up river, right?
[27:04.25]I don't want to pump it into the river.
[27:10.15]Don't tell him.
[27:10.87]Wrong way.
[27:11.63]Arrows.
[27:12.19]Yeah, the arrows are pointing this way, so I need to pump it in.
[27:17.09]Wait, you just dump waste into fucking rivers and shit?
[27:25.09]So this is current.
[27:25.83]This is pumping down.
[27:26.81]This would be pumping upstream.
[27:28.81]This is pumping.
[27:29.53]Can I tilt it?
[27:30.13]Can I turn it?
[27:33.69]Is there a way to like tilt buildings?
[27:34.78]Like turn buildings?
[27:40.53]Maybe that's wrong?
[27:42.05]It just flows with the water.
[27:43.11]Yeah, so this is going downstream.
[27:45.73]So just make sure there's no, like, houses or anything right here.
[27:54.44]You'll get green options later.
[27:56.22]Oh.
[27:57.28]Change the music.
[28:02.15]Put it at the edge of the map?
[28:05.23]So, like, down here.
[28:07.93]Alright, just whatever.
[28:08.73]It's at the end of the world.
[28:10.63]Evil fucking music.
[28:12.93]Does this need to be connected?
[28:19.22]Connect the water pipes and drains.
[28:21.14]So now I have to connect this to all the houses.
[28:30.44]Holy shit, this is complicated.
[28:32.32]Okay.
[28:32.84]Okay.
[28:39.60]I wish the tutorial would tell me just how to fucking basically control a camera.
[28:43.66]Alright, so now we go like this.
[28:48.43]Okay.
[28:51.25]Here we go.
[28:54.27]That's correct.
[28:54.91]That's okay.
[28:55.55]So now the water is here.
[28:57.29]The water pumping station needs to be connected to here, right?
[29:01.80]Is this correct?
[29:03.60]That's correct, right?
[29:08.59]Done.
[29:09.13]Alright, you got water?
[29:09.93]Okay.
[29:16.14]Water pipe.
[29:18.24]Heating.
[29:19.16]Oh, it needs heat pipes, too.
[29:20.49]Not yet.
[29:21.95]Water pipe with heating pipe.
[29:25.75]Okay, sounds good.
[29:26.33]I mean, it kind of works.
[29:31.54]So that's that.
[29:33.62]This is like the shit drain where all the pee and stuff goes.
[29:38.03]That's where all the pee goes.
[29:39.77]And then this is the water pump, which is connected here, which pumps water into the houses.
[29:45.81]I have to connect these.
[29:50.83]What?
[29:56.03]Hold on.
[29:56.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[29:56.87]Isn't this like the shit and stuff?
[30:06.48]it doesn't matter oh so wait the water is coming in here and like the shit is coming in here alright so it doesn't matter alright time for power I'll figure this out don't worry it's gonna be a long one don't worry guys this stream is gonna be like fuck this stream will be at least four to eight hours four to six hours you know that's gonna be a long one it'll be at least three to six hours okay um I'll figure it out
[30:32.84]Now I need power.
[30:33.94]Oh wait, should I?
[30:38.10]Hooray, the water pumping station has been constructed!
[30:40.06]Fresh water!
[30:41.14]Mayo or rocks?
[30:42.60]Mayo rocks!
[30:43.94]Okay, you're gonna really throw in your like, mayo agenda at the end of that tweet?
[30:52.97]Okay, how do I build power?
[30:53.95]Isn't this right here?
[30:55.17]Garbage and industry.
[30:56.11]Where's power?
[30:56.57]Oh, electricity.
[31:02.19]Okay, power plants produce electricity.
[31:05.31]For all your mo- Pause.
[31:10.55]Power plants produce electricity for all your modern cities need.
[31:13.43]Electricity will move from building to building over short distances.
[31:18.09]But to transfer electricity over great distances, you'll need to build power lines.
[31:22.59]This is gonna be so fucked up.
[31:24.29]When placing power lines, you can see the reach.
[31:27.01]So I get it.
[31:27.66]You build the infrastructure first.
[31:30.25]Before you build any fucking roads.
[31:32.36]You do all this shit first.
[31:34.46]And then you build the roads over it.
[31:37.32]You go from bottom up.
[31:39.22]I get it.
[31:39.62]We'll do that next time.
[31:42.60]No shit.
[31:45.67]I love how people are saying to me, no shit.
[31:49.31]When I've never played a city builder in my entire life.
[31:52.61]I'm not a fucking architect.
[31:58.34]I didn't know you had to- I thought you had to individually put buildings down, like fucking Monopoly style, one by one on each grid.
[32:06.39]This is a new experience for me.
[32:07.87]So I would appreciate banning that person.
[32:12.37]For life.
[32:13.97]Okay.
[32:17.30]When placing power lines, you can see the reach of electricity around the buildings.
[32:20.78]So here's a power line.
[32:25.53]You can see the reach of electricity around the buildings is a light blue area.
[32:27.75]Connect these areas with power lines to move electricity between them.
[32:30.35]Power plants produce ground and noise pollution.
[32:33.45]When placing a power plant in a circular area around the houses you follow- whatever.
[32:36.50]Okay.
[32:38.94]So... I- okay, on all the streets I've ever been on, power lines are like here.
[32:48.02]Like, they go like this.
[32:53.80]Should I put them behind the houses?
[32:57.70]Okay.
[33:00.87]That's a street right there.
[33:01.91]Is that working?
[33:14.46]And then we need to go to the power plant.
[33:16.14]Let's just look at the picture.
[33:20.86]How do you undo?
[33:23.06]Is there an undo?
[33:24.52]What is the undo?
[33:26.54]No, these are not just... Okay, these are pow... I'm thinking about... In like... When I... Okay, listen.
[33:32.60]Listen to me.
[33:33.10]This is important.
[33:34.88]When I lived in Massachusetts, every road had fucking power lines and poles going across.
[33:40.07]It's not that kind of power line and poles.
[33:42.61]Out here in Vegas, they're all underground.
[33:44.55]But you guys know what I'm talking about when you drive?
[33:46.07]I didn't know.
[33:46.49]I thought... Okay, I get it.
[33:48.81]There were power lines fucking everywhere in Massachusetts.
[33:51.40]On every street.
[33:53.08]It's like this.
[33:54.22]I'm just going on based on what I grew up looking at.
[33:57.42]Those are telephone lines.
[33:58.50]I know, but, like, I... I'm sorry.
[34:01.18]I don't- I'm not a fucking ar- okay.
[34:03.30]I'm not an architect.
[34:04.70]And I never- I'm not a city builder.
[34:06.78]I'm an- I'm an- I'm a begging e-clown.
[34:10.34]Did you get- understand the difference?
[34:13.49]Okay, so.
[34:14.97]Let's, uh... How do I remove this?
[34:18.33]Why the fuck is there scary fucking music?
[34:22.95]How do I change the music?
[34:28.84]Bottom right.
[34:31.20]Free camera.
[34:34.28]Global happiness.
[34:38.74]Wait, I can do wind.
[34:42.13]Don't tell him.
[34:42.97]No, tell me how to change the fucking music.
[34:48.55]How do I change the music?
[34:52.93]Where's the music?
[34:56.56]Oh, here it is, okay.
[34:57.90]But how do you change it?
[35:00.66]Classical.
[35:03.04]Rock City.
[35:03.96]Alright, how about, what's one of the ones I paid for?
[35:06.54]Campus Radio.
[35:09.64]Please note some of the radio channels have licensed music and cannot be used when streaming.
[35:17.83]Let's turn it off!
[35:23.45]All that jazz.
[35:25.43]Hey.
[35:28.14]That's alright.
[35:29.97]A little loud, but here, let's... Oh, no, I don't want you... This is... I don't like when people see my menus.
[35:39.31]I feel like you're looking at me naked.
[35:41.62]You know what I mean?
[35:42.08]This is... I don't want you... This is, like, weird.
[35:44.54]What are your settings at?
[35:45.44]I don't want you to see this.
[35:49.00]There we go.
[35:53.90]Anyway, that's better.
[35:55.73]Increase the FOV.
[35:56.63]There is no FOV in this fucking game.
[35:58.19]Alright, sure.
[35:58.63]Here, I'll do it.
[35:59.07]Okay.
[36:04.01]He's got VSync turned on.
[36:06.13]I don't think I'm worried about frames in this one.
[36:09.91]It doesn't matter.
[36:11.71]I'm not playing, like, Counter-Strike with, like, a fucking 240Hz monitor, guys.
[36:15.50]It's a city sky... Alright.
[36:19.52]So...
[36:22.88]When placing a power plant, so you just kind of connect to a power plant.
[36:26.88]So put a power plant, like, over here.
[36:30.31]Like, right over here.
[36:32.45]I get it.
[36:33.35]This is just a tutorial for me, guys, alright?
[36:35.07]Just relax.
[36:36.15]Power plant.
[36:37.61]Coal?
[36:40.07]Coal?
[36:40.67]Uses coal?
[36:41.57]Wait, there's gonna be a coal plant over here?
[36:47.15]Building must be placed on a roadside?
[36:49.47]What?! !
[36:52.97]Alright, this is gonna be where the industry is.
[36:54.35]This is gonna be industry way.
[37:02.82]Um, okay.
[37:11.05]He will learn.
[37:11.95]I will learn.
[37:13.01]You must learn.
[37:14.75]Learn what?
[37:16.39]Everything.
[37:17.85]Don't fucking give me an opportunity to make a three-eyed raven quote, okay?
[37:22.61]I'll do it every time.
[37:23.79]I'll do it every fucking single time.
[37:25.47]Do not let me do that again.
[37:34.97]Alright, so now we build.
[37:35.83]Alright, here we go.
[37:40.77]On this side.
[37:41.26]That's... Oh, it has to be... Does it have to be directly connected to a power line?
[37:47.28]Does that have to be directly connected?
[37:52.14]No.
[37:52.58]Just to be in the circle?
[37:58.39]Yes.
[38:00.25]Look at the drawing.
[38:03.07]Sick.
[38:03.61]Okay.
[38:04.21]Right here.
[38:05.17]I don't want it to be too close to the residential area.
[38:08.84]Fuck.
[38:15.43]Well, come on.
[38:16.45]I thought it was the circle.
[38:18.25]Not this one.
[38:18.99]Alright, it's gonna be moved.
[38:20.07]How do I undo?
[38:22.51]Why is it no undo?
[38:26.67]I'm learning.
[38:27.19]I'm learning.
[38:27.63]I'm learning.
[38:27.95]This is a learning stream.
[38:29.57]Bottom right bulldozer.
[38:32.00]Yoink.
[38:33.50]Okay.
[38:34.54]Coal power plant.
[38:36.10]Right here should do it.
[38:36.90]There we are.
[38:38.78]We're now producing power to every citizen on Earth.
[38:45.67]Okay.
[38:46.85]When placing a power plant, the circular area around it tells you how far the pollution spreads.
[38:50.57]Maybe if you read the text!
[38:51.65]Alright, sounds good.
[38:54.99]Let's get the fuck out of this.
[38:56.87]Um... This is not working?
[39:01.07]Why is it- this is broken.
[39:05.52]What's wrong with this?
[39:15.26]Why is it broken?
[39:16.40]It's like a severed plug.
[39:18.10]What does that mean?
[39:20.11]Oh.
[39:22.47]A local power plant is online.
[39:23.95]Maybe I'll get my TV working again.
[39:25.53]Hashtag reality shows 24-7.
[39:32.17]I love the smell of burning fossil fuel in the morning.
[39:34.30]Dino power.
[39:35.18]Pro fossil.
[39:35.88]Alright, I'm starting to understand what's going on here.
[39:38.74]So what the hell is this?
[39:42.22]Is this how I leave the city?
[39:58.37]Wait a minute, this is how they leave the city.
[40:01.03]They can't go this way.
[40:08.03]Traffic is kind of... Nobody can even go down this road.
[40:15.91]Malicious compliance.
[40:18.95]I said to build four lanes.
[40:23.37]I'm gonna do it.
[40:27.13]Redditor.
[40:27.63]Oh, stop.
[40:31.41]Whatever, I'll fix it later.
[40:32.65]We'll fix it in post.
[40:33.47]Okay, so, uh, how's everybody doing?
[40:37.05]We need more stuff.
[40:38.29]Let's go to, uh, um, um... No, no, no, I don't want any more of this shit.
[40:43.73]Oh, I'll delete these.
[40:45.87]Can you delete this?
[40:49.18]How much space is this?
[40:57.89]What was the emergency?
[41:00.37]Was that the emergency warning?
[41:01.95]I'm not sure.
[41:02.49]What the fuck is it talking about?
[41:05.61]Alright, so this is fine, right?
[41:13.98]I love Hey Arnold, but I don't want to hear Hey Arnold music right now.
[41:17.62]How about this one?
[41:25.32]Okay, so.
[41:27.06]I need to build some more industry or something.
[41:30.84]Wiz Tutorial Part 2.
[41:33.24]Reach a population of four.
[41:34.14]Alright, we need more buildings.
[41:35.83]Zone.
[41:37.47]Uh, here.
[41:37.91]Let's add some neighbors.
[41:38.71]Give me a road.
[41:45.33]No, no.
[41:45.67]I don't want a huge-ass road.
[41:47.13]Alright, this is gonna go like this.
[42:04.17]It's so ugly.
[42:05.29]It doesn't matter.
[42:08.95]How many lanes is this?
[42:11.39]Wait.
[42:13.47]Hold on.
[42:13.95]Is this a one-way?
[42:14.97]Hold on.
[42:20.03]Is this two... Wait.
[42:22.08]No, this is a two-lane road.
[42:24.84]Okay, that's fine.
[42:28.84]Is it day-night cycle?
[42:29.90]Holy shit!
[42:34.22]Alright, let's go, uh, more houses.
[42:36.08]This is just one little road.
[42:37.63]Where's my thing?
[42:45.77]There.
[42:49.65]There!
[42:50.07]Look at that!
[42:50.75]Okay, now we need electricity to go...
[43:03.05]How many citizens?
[43:04.71]He's running out of- Oh fuck, I only have two thousand dollars!
[43:08.76]Wait, hold on.
[43:10.70]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[43:12.76]What the fuck are you talking about?
[43:15.68]City budget?
[43:17.28]For 2020?
[43:17.54]Wait, people have to park on the street?
[43:27.16]Local budget meeting for Wink Dink City for 2020.
[43:31.25]We're building a new city.
[43:33.41]We are allowing $41,000 to build 12 power plants, 500 houses.
[43:40.47]It's gonna be anthills.
[43:41.47]Excuse me.
[43:41.91]What do you mean there are no jobs?
[43:47.95]Holy shit, they're crashing into each other.
[43:49.75]There's people!
[43:51.01]Hey, look, there's people!
[43:53.95]They need jobs.
[43:54.71]Alright, well, we'll give them jobs.
[43:57.83]How do I give somebody a job?
[44:01.17]At the water and sewage plants?
[44:04.17]People work here?
[44:04.88]I need to build commercial... Okay, everyone needs to work at the water and sewage zone.
[44:13.96]I need to zone commercial.
[44:16.84]Oh, okay.
[44:17.46]I don't have any fucking money.
[44:23.85]Wait.
[44:25.10]Let's have it just be businesses like right here.
[44:37.40]Alright, this is going to be commercial.
[44:42.61]Why are they saying no water?
[44:43.77]Do we have to have a day-night cycle in this game?
[44:48.61]What's this?
[44:49.59]Disasters incoming.
[44:50.71]What?
[44:51.03]What?
[44:52.73]Hold on, why is it saying disasters?
[44:56.34]They don't have any water?
[44:56.90]What do you mean they have no water?
[44:59.02]Oh.
[45:02.90]Oh, you motherfucker.
[45:04.12]This needs electricity.
[45:06.06]Okay.
[45:07.10]But... How the... What?
[45:14.11]What?
[45:21.04]Holy shit, this is the wrong, okay.
[45:23.86]This needed to be on the other side of the whole world.
[45:27.85]Take a loan, alright, I'm starting over.
[45:30.83]I'm starting over, new one, new game.
[45:37.70]What do we know?
[45:40.26]How do I take a loan out?
[45:42.82]Budget.
[45:44.98]You can manage your city's taxes.
[45:46.20]Oh, you charge taxes?
[45:48.96]Budget and loans here.
[45:50.80]Majority positive.
[45:51.94]The majority of your city's income comes from taxes.
[45:55.07]Tax income is based on the size and level of the buildings in each of the zones.
[46:00.11]High taxation will make people unhappy and might cause them to move away.
[46:06.11]A bigger budget for a service means its facilities work more efficiently, but also becomes more expensive to maintain.
[46:11.86]Right.
[46:12.70]City service budgets can be adjusted separately for day and night time from the sliders in the budget view.
[46:17.18]You can take loans from different banks.
[46:19.98]The amount and interest rates differ from bank to bank, and there's a limited number of loans that can be taken simultaneously.
[46:26.06]Okay, well, let's just, let's take a huge loan out.
[46:29.71]Income.
[46:30.31]Uh, okay.
[46:32.33]We saw a loan.
[46:33.21]Loans.
[46:38.66]How do I get a loan?
[46:39.46]I don't have enough people to take a loan out.
[46:48.39]You need a bigger city for a loan.
[47:07.77]New game.
[47:08.23]I want a different map.
[47:09.11]I want... What do I want?
[47:14.44]Garden Rivers?
[47:18.16]Eden Valley?
[47:21.44]I want a balanced place.
[47:25.98]Turn off... Turn on infinite money.
[47:27.94]I'm not going to do that.
[47:30.10]San Vegas?
[47:34.79]No, I'm not ready for San Vegas.
[47:36.25]Where's San Vegas?
[47:41.25]I'm gonna do one of the easy ones.
[47:48.15]Like, this one looks pretty easy.
[47:50.71]Eden Valley.
[47:52.08]Wait, this is the one I just did.
[47:56.44]Dude, dust a dust bowl.
[47:59.24]No, these are difficult.
[48:00.82]Wait, Marble Canyon.
[48:02.04]This looks pretty cool.
[48:02.76]No, it's too advanced.
[48:04.00]Too advanced.
[48:04.82]Too advanced.
[48:05.90]Too advanced.
[48:07.02]Garden Rivers.
[48:07.80]I'm doing it.
[48:15.87]I still have to learn how to play.
[48:17.43]I'm not... Turn off the day-night cycle on the options.
[48:21.05]Good call.
[48:27.01]Boo, boo.
[48:28.25]I need to learn.
[48:29.45]I can't just... You should have played the tutorial.
[48:32.13]I just did.
[48:32.67]That's what I'm doing.
[48:36.71]I'm learning how to play.
[48:38.07]Hey, you should have done the tutorial.
[48:43.05]I'm doing it right now.
[48:45.23]That's what I'm doing.
[48:51.20]Alright, options.
[48:53.28]Gameplay.
[48:54.18]Day-night cycle.
[48:57.29]Yeah, I changed it to Fahrenheit, whatever.
[49:00.29]People are gonna be really bad.
[49:01.47]Okay, turn off the day-night cycle.
[49:03.93]I just want it to be light.
[49:06.61]Okay, so, road.
[49:08.60]I want a medium road.
[49:12.30]You're not even gonna let me build a medium road.
[49:14.90]Oh, I actually did fail the tutorial.
[49:16.22]Okay.
[49:18.74]Alright, so.
[49:20.66]Let's go with... This is fine.
[49:26.10]Go straight up.
[49:26.90]Okay, I gotta... No, no, no, no, no.
[49:29.12]No, I gotta plan this out.
[49:30.88]Oh, I can't even do zoning yet.
[49:32.50]So, here we go.
[49:33.68]I want up here.
[49:35.60]We're gonna go into the city here.
[49:37.90]Then this is gonna...
[49:41.12]Uh, curve out this way.
[49:43.54]This is gonna be fucking residential area.
[49:47.32]Pause the game.
[49:50.34]So, this is residential.
[49:52.98]Over here.
[49:53.34]Right there.
[49:59.53]No curves.
[50:01.27]No curves.
[50:02.05]Why?
[50:06.79]Invalid shape.
[50:08.01]Distance too short.
[50:08.85]Okay, don't worry about it.
[50:11.85]You don't need a huge fucking road.
[50:13.49]Okay, now... From here, let's go... Let's do a few streets.
[50:29.37]Just two or three streets.
[50:30.53]Just like little ones.
[50:33.43]Just like that.
[50:34.49]Just little roads.
[50:35.45]Just little streets.
[50:38.90]Like that?
[50:40.28]Just little ones, not big ones.
[50:47.83]These are different streets.
[50:52.41]What are you doing?
[50:53.57]I'm making- I'm doing a- I'm writing a big F for fuck you!
[50:58.13]For con- con- controversially making fun of me!
[51:03.79]How does that sound?
[51:05.51]Are we at a raid right now?
[51:06.79]Who?
[51:07.21]What?
[51:09.04]Is that where the... Hi, guys.
[51:10.82]Whoever you are.
[51:11.36]What do you mean, what do you mean, raid?
[51:15.64]I don't see a raid.
[51:17.16]Who?
[51:17.80]Where?
[51:18.04]Okay, that's enough, that's enough, that's enough.
[51:25.85]This is the get in.
[51:27.45]Alright, so you get in, and, well, there's that street.
[51:29.35]Oh, look at all, look at this nice place.
[51:32.17]Look at this cool place.
[51:33.31]This is to get out.
[51:35.11]This is like, oh, bye, we're leaving.
[51:37.32]See you later.
[51:37.78]Alright, bye.
[51:38.28]Did I not?
[51:45.38]Do you not understand highways?
[51:47.00]I can't even build a fucking highway.
[51:55.31]Yes, you can.
[51:56.59]What?
[51:57.47]Why is everything grayed out?
[51:59.70]Six lane, six lane one-way road is what I should have done.
[52:09.11]Keep looking at the tabs.
[52:13.75]Two... What the fuck?
[52:17.91]Okay.
[52:19.51]It's the tabs, not the options.
[52:24.50]I can't build a highway, guys.
[52:29.49]I physically can't build this.
[52:34.13]I already looked at that.
[52:37.14]It's fine.
[52:37.64]Ignore chat.
[52:38.36]That's what I'm going to do.
[52:39.02]Alright, so this is cool.
[52:41.68]Cool.
[52:41.86]Let's go up here.
[52:42.70]And then from here, let's have this connect.
[52:47.16]I'm going to curve it.
[52:48.86]I know you said don't curve your roads.
[52:50.68]Don't curve roads.
[52:52.52]But I'm going to do it.
[52:57.85]That looks like shit.
[53:01.02]We gotta go out a little further.
[53:02.92]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[53:04.10]This is just dead ends.
[53:05.00]All dead ends.
[53:05.46]Fuck it.
[53:06.04]Only dead ends.
[53:07.94]We'll go out one more over here.
[53:12.64]Okay, these are where the houses are gonna be.
[53:14.01]There'll be like a fucking park or something right here.
[53:16.65]Relax.
[53:22.05]It's not even.
[53:22.73]It's not supposed to be.
[53:23.39]There's gonna be a big park here.
[53:26.79]Okay, now let's go... So this is like some... You know, houses people live here.
[53:32.23]And then we're gonna go this way for some shopping centers.
[53:35.13]Sounds good to me.
[53:37.93]Shop... Use shopping centers.
[53:40.84]So you turn... This intersection right here will do.
[53:44.62]Like this.
[53:45.70]Alright, and then we got some... This is a shopping unit over here.
[53:55.76]Key!
[54:02.96]Let's curve it down here.
[54:04.00]And there's going to be a bunch of shopping.
[54:07.22]Shopping.
[54:09.00]Perfect.
[54:09.54]Okay.
[54:13.55]Now.
[54:17.19]What the fuck do I... How the fuck do people leave?
[54:20.86]From here, we got residential, residential, residential.
[54:23.36]There's your water pump.
[54:24.34]There's your fucking, uh... That's where the water comes from over here.
[54:27.86]The power is gonna be right here as well.
[54:30.40]We need industry.
[54:31.05]We need like a place where all the fucking stuff happens.
[54:33.57]Okay.
[54:35.13]So from here, this is gonna be industry road.
[54:41.17]Look it.
[54:41.45]See?
[54:41.57]It's like a big intersection.
[54:42.37]I know what the fuck I'm doing.
[54:48.55]Industry up here.
[54:52.12]I'm done.
[54:52.46]Okay.
[54:55.03]So this is where like power plants and the pump shit and they're gonna be connected and then down here.
[54:58.97]Okay, I'm done for a little bit.
[55:04.31]I've got- no, I gotta make the way out.
[55:05.97]This is how you get out of here.
[55:10.19]What the hell are you doing?
[55:10.87]Don't do a curved road.
[55:13.63]No curved roads.
[55:18.73]Is that okay?
[55:20.88]Press E when building curved roads.
[55:26.29]That's alright, isn't it?
[55:32.55]That's fine.
[55:33.73]That's fine.
[55:38.52]Holy shit, big bits.
[55:43.80]That's a lot of bits.
[55:46.11]That's two... Freddy Dredd, another 200 fucking dollars.
[55:49.96]$20,000 in bits.
[55:52.42]That's technically correct, what I just said.
[55:55.50]$20,000 in bits, which is converted into $200 into human money.
[56:01.96]He just paid for the game.
[56:03.27]Yeah, thanks for buying all the game and the DLC and all the music we're not listening to.
[56:08.89]What's one that I purchased?
[56:12.45]Mars?
[56:14.99]Concerts?
[56:22.32]Country Road.
[56:23.00]Here we go.
[56:24.32]Is that ads?
[56:27.67]Hold on, is this like GTA?
[56:32.31]Okay, game's paused.
[56:36.41]Freddy Cersei, though.
[56:37.15]Hope you're staying safe, my boy.
[56:38.76]I'm in day six of quarantine since I flew on a plane from California.
[56:43.06]I'm slowly losing my damn mind thanks for streaming.
[56:46.42]But not quite.
[56:48.69]Yeah, it's... It's happening pretty much everywhere now.
[56:52.09]Just don't... Just fucking don't go anywhere.
[56:55.44]Don't do anything you don't have to do.
[56:57.68]Stay the fuck in your damn house.
[57:00.76]If you're... If you're in a place that has... Currently on a lockdown... Stay in your house.
[57:08.31]Don't go anywhere you don't have to go.
[57:09.99]Don't fucking go to... Hey, no, I think it's a good time for me to go shopping and go all over the place.
[57:15.29]Let me go to a fucking concert.
[57:17.46]Don't do that.
[57:18.96]Stay the fuck in your house.
[57:21.02]If you're under one of these lockdowns.
[57:30.92]And watch Cities Skylines by Jerma985.
[57:33.64]Seriously, thanks for the 200 fucking dollars, dude.
[57:39.52]You give so much money to this channel, it's unbelievable.
[57:48.50]Yeah, don't go into crowds, like, just don't, like, don't do it.
[57:51.79]There's no reason to do it.
[57:53.39]There's no reason to.
[57:56.34]Don't do it.
[57:58.10]It's not fucking, it's not worth it.
[58:00.52]Because even if you don't, let's say you're on like a lockdown.
[58:04.01]Or let's say you're in one of these areas that's seen a lot of cases, right?
[58:09.73]If you don't, even if you don't get the coronavirus, you could give it to somebody else, you know?
[58:15.66]You get it on your hands, you know, you don't get sick, but you could give it to somebody else.
[58:23.78]Okay, mom.
[58:24.54]I'm just being, I just want, listen to me.
[58:29.16]Play the game.
[58:31.70]Listen to me, kids!
[58:36.25]I will be your mother right now, and I will tell you these things.
[58:44.97]Alright, anyways.
[58:46.42]Let's go.
[58:47.80]Oh, wait, no, no, no, keep pause, keep pause.
[58:51.64]This is in the news.
[58:56.13]I know.
[58:56.79]I know.
[58:57.27]I know.
[58:58.07]I know you all know.
[58:59.85]But we need to make sure we keep talking about it so we can get rid of this shit.
[59:03.25]Alright, here we go.
[59:09.42]Residential.
[59:10.04]Residential.
[59:11.10]Residential.
[59:11.66]All this is residential.
[59:12.46]These are all side streets.
[59:14.84]Not this.
[59:21.16]Here we are.
[59:22.24]Okay.
[59:22.40]Good.
[59:22.58]Good.
[59:22.88]Good.
[59:27.97]Actually, I don't think I want houses here.
[59:30.87]No, I don't.
[59:36.45]I probably could have done that way easier, but whatever.
[59:39.99]Actually, why not?
[59:41.47]That's fine.
[59:43.91]Do I want houses over here, though?
[59:45.46]Maybe it should be restaurants and shops and stuff on this side.
[59:48.98]Okay.
[59:49.08]So, electricity.
[59:51.50]Electricity.
[59:54.01]We need to have electricity from here.
[59:57.63]So I'm just going to go from... Is this wide enough?
[60:00.65]How can I see the wideness?
[60:03.46]Like how much this... What the circle looks like.
[60:05.32]Can I see it?
[60:05.96]Do I have to put it down first?
[60:11.20]Oh, I don't need to do this, do I?
[60:13.84]Let the buildings get built first.
[60:15.04]Right, right, right, right.
[60:15.62]Okay, okay, yeah.
[60:16.32]Good call, good call.
[60:17.30]Good call.
[60:21.22]But I need industry too.
[60:23.43]Wait, don't blow all your money yet.
[60:24.61]Hold on.
[60:27.70]I need commercial over here.
[60:31.72]Let's just do this area here.
[60:33.06]For commercial.
[60:38.02]Right?
[60:38.52]That's smart, isn't it?
[60:41.08]That's enough.
[60:43.74]Industrial needs to be zoned over here.
[60:50.20]So should I make industry over here?
[60:51.82]Or...
[60:58.45]Just do this, like, down here.
[60:59.57]Yeah, okay.
[61:03.33]Looks alright.
[61:05.18]Alright, cool.
[61:05.78]Now I got enough.
[61:07.72]Let's let this play out, and I'm gonna build some electricity.
[61:12.96]I provide jobs... ...for citizens and produce goods for local businesses.
[61:18.12]Industry uses a lot of water and produces ground pollution to its surroundings.
[61:21.82]So don't put it near houses.
[61:24.50]Safe distance away from residential.
[61:25.78]Alright, I have the right to do.
[61:26.90]Okay.
[61:28.97]Let's go.
[61:30.47]Here come the houses.
[61:31.37]Let's get them built.
[61:33.53]We're going to need power here really soon.
[61:43.70]Okay.
[61:44.08]We got our first house built.
[61:45.28]First house that needs power.
[61:49.62]Wait until these are all built.
[61:50.48]And then I'm going to do the electricity.
[61:51.54]You just go maybe potentially one power plant.
[61:55.74]Jumping unit.
[62:05.53]So, power plant and a dumping unit.
[62:08.48]There's no such thing as downriver.
[62:10.12]It's all just a stale river, right?
[62:14.84]He's doing better than 80% of chat.
[62:17.26]Thank you.
[62:19.26]I want that.
[62:20.26]Twitch, where's my gold medal I can give to people?
[62:26.12]Where's my gold medal?
[62:27.22]It's not VIP.
[62:27.96]It's temporary, like 20-minute gold medal you give to somebody.
[62:31.45]Why?
[62:31.69]I want it.
[62:37.38]No, not Reddit Gold.
[62:38.46]Alright, it is like Reddit Gold, but it doesn't cost any money.
[62:41.36]The streamer does it.
[62:42.02]Alright, here we go.
[62:45.30]Alright, build.
[62:45.82]Hurry up.
[62:48.86]Hurry the fuck up.
[62:49.81]Hurry the fuck up.
[62:50.75]Hurry the fuck up.
[62:52.51]Why are these not getting built?
[62:53.67]This game sucks.
[62:54.79]Alright, here we go.
[63:03.13]This... Can one power these?
[63:05.95]Build hard.
[63:06.36]I need to build.
[63:11.56]Speed it up.
[63:12.08]Let's go.
[63:12.84]Hurry up.
[63:17.98]Why is it not being built down here?
[63:19.90]Is there a reason why they're not being built down here?
[63:29.07]It's just gradual.
[63:29.99]Oh, okay.
[63:31.19]So, start correcting me if I'm incorrect.
[63:35.06]If I go like this, I just need one, oh my god, I just need one.
[63:40.60]For here, and then one, I don't need that many, right?
[63:45.60]Uh, closet.
[63:48.20]That's a hundred community subs.
[63:50.68]Thanks for the fucking insane, ridiculous amount of money.
[63:53.52]That's a hundred subs.
[63:54.98]It was 200 bucks from Freddy Dread, now it's a hundred community subs from Zixia.
[63:58.62]That's so much, thank you.
[64:05.99]Just one connects to the blue, okay?
[64:08.67]So, like, if I go like this, out to here, and let's say for the power plant there, that's correct, right?
[64:19.11]Yes.
[64:19.43]Okay, good.
[64:20.51]Good.
[64:20.83]He's getting it.
[64:22.61]Ah, I'm getting it.
[64:23.13]This game's sick.
[64:24.57]I'm fucking so excited.
[64:25.53]I'm wicked happy.
[64:26.91]Alright.
[64:28.13]So, let me build the power plant first.
[64:33.76]This is where industry's gonna be.
[64:37.23]This is the... Alright, so this is where it's gonna be.
[64:40.70]Bang.
[64:43.18]We go.
[64:44.34]Right there.
[64:47.52]And... Would you look at that?
[64:51.50]Electric!
[64:55.36]Very, very cool.
[64:56.44]Alright.
[64:57.22]This needs power too.
[64:58.59]Oh, shit.
[64:59.65]Okay.
[65:00.95]Wait for a second.
[65:02.41]So this is powering everything.
[65:07.51]Okay, now we need... Where's water?
[65:09.13]Okay, water.
[65:12.68]Same deal.
[65:13.82]Water pump.
[65:17.78]Right here?
[65:20.92]And then a water dumping unit.
[65:22.40]Water drain pipe.
[65:23.62]Oh, shit.
[65:25.83]Um... This is... How do you...
[65:36.65]There's no stream.
[65:38.65]I guess, is it going this way?
[65:40.41]Let me see.
[65:43.35]It's going that way.
[65:44.97]So, oh, I have to go, as long as I just do it right here.
[65:52.13]Technically, right?
[65:53.05]I just need to swap them.
[65:59.79]Alright, swap these out.
[66:04.16]So the pumping station needs to go here.
[66:11.18]Like right here.
[66:14.38]And then the dump station goes here, so it'll be dumping that way.
[66:18.40]Or even like here.
[66:19.12]Alright, that's fine.
[66:23.79]Dumping station here.
[66:26.85]That's better.
[66:28.33]Okay, so then they're pumping clean water here and they're dumping dirty water there.
[66:35.88]Alright.
[66:36.62]Sounds easy.
[66:38.18]Water pipe.
[66:38.90]Here we go.
[66:42.08]So this has to hit all this shit.
[66:44.42]All of them.
[66:54.95]It's not symmetrical.
[66:55.81]It's not symmetrical.
[66:56.81]It's not symmetrical.
[66:59.09]I want ban them.
[67:00.01]Ban them all.
[67:01.46]Ban them all.
[67:09.85]Okay, cool.
[67:13.42]Water pipe this way.
[67:14.26]Ooh!
[67:16.45]This is fun.
[67:17.47]This is like an iPad game with all the money.
[67:19.61]I like this game.
[67:37.52]Alright, so that's water.
[67:40.14]So they'll connect them.
[67:43.30]Okay.
[67:43.60]So we're all good.
[67:44.84]Right?
[67:46.38]Do these need to be connected too?
[67:47.44]Does everything have to be connected?
[67:48.72]Everything.
[67:58.37]Oh, the sewage.
[67:59.11]Right, alright, sewage.
[68:00.01]So sewage connects to here.
[68:02.29]And they just have to be connected.
[68:05.79]So as long as this is here...
[68:08.05]Does this have to go across everything as well?
[68:11.77]So this will take on the properties of this whole entire unit here, right?
[68:17.39]Like that.
[68:18.25]So this is now taking on everything.
[68:20.37]All these units.
[68:22.58]Should I go from here to here too?
[68:24.50]Like this.
[68:25.98]This is taking on all these units.
[68:31.50]No.
[68:31.94]Don't have to do that.
[68:32.52]Okay.
[68:34.06]Okay.
[68:36.98]What you're saying is I should be careful with using these units.
[68:42.22]Twice as much.
[68:42.87]I should be double careful.
[68:44.47]Be double careful.
[68:45.29]So be like BB.
[68:49.93]Like a BB unit.
[68:51.53]Let's see.
[69:02.61]But I'm glad everybody fucking hates it.
[69:04.79]Makes me so fucking happy.
[69:06.47]Alright, so we need power to everything, which I need more than that.
[69:11.79]Well, I'm getting it.
[69:16.73]So, uh, well, they have to build first.
[69:19.15]Let's go, build.
[69:21.39]TV working again?
[69:22.27]Nice, I can watch my reality shows.
[69:25.92]These need power too.
[69:27.92]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[69:33.50]Oh, shit.
[69:34.04]Okay, hold on.
[69:44.14]This is fucking cool.
[69:45.12]Alright, let's go.
[69:49.38]The real Jerma just came through.
[69:51.03]They're not getting water?
[69:54.23]What is with the waterworks?
[69:55.81]Showering with bottled water is expensive.
[70:03.64]Wait, what?
[70:07.08]It's pumping right now!
[70:10.66]How is this not pumping?
[70:18.74]It's not connected?
[70:19.60]Yes, it is.
[70:24.12]What?
[70:29.52]It does have power.
[70:42.73]Connected the pump to the side of the building.
[70:49.67]Wait, it wasn't connected?
[70:50.79]Oh, shit.
[70:54.21]I thought it was connected.
[70:55.13]How am I... Is this connected?
[70:56.61]Okay, we're good.
[71:02.79]Cool, cool, cool, cool, cool.
[71:04.05]I only have $17,000.
[71:05.07]Oh, fuck.
[71:06.49]They need power here.
[71:07.50]Um, wait.
[71:08.88]Alright, you need power too.
[71:10.80]Everybody needs power.
[71:11.66]Everybody needs power.
[71:12.70]Take it.
[71:15.26]Got it.
[71:15.88]Good.
[71:16.50]Go.
[71:19.40]Why are these not powered?
[71:21.32]Alright, let's go.
[71:21.90]But there's no plumbing here.
[71:25.53]Uh oh.
[71:26.01]Yeah, there is.
[71:27.59]Alright, we're fine.
[71:30.25]Our first little town is working completely as intended.
[71:35.44]This feels like I'm teaching my mother how to use her phone.
[71:39.21]Well, that would be accurate if your mother has never used a telephone in her entire life.
[71:43.61]If your mother woke up one day after using rock stones and newspapers to get all of her information, and you showed her a cell phone for the first time, yes, it's going to take her a little while to figure it out.
[71:57.70]It's going to take her a minute.
[72:01.84]Yes, that's probably pretty accurate.
[72:07.99]Cave mom.
[72:08.85]Alright, how do I start charging absurd taxes?
[72:17.85]Alright, wait, wait, wait.
[72:18.91]Why are people not using their garages?
[72:21.33]Everyone's parking on the streets.
[72:31.24]They don't have garages.
[72:34.32]Yes, they do.
[72:35.66]How many fucking cars do you have?
[72:41.17]One, two, three, four.
[72:43.76]And that implies that there's at least two in here.
[72:45.74]Everybody has so many cars.
[72:54.77]This person even has a clown car.
[72:57.35]Alright, cool.
[72:57.79]So we got $15,000.
[72:58.55]How things look when people need jobs.
[73:04.50]Alright, looking good.
[73:05.90]Tax them.
[73:06.36]They're too rich.
[73:09.06]Alright, let's look at the money market.
[73:13.32]Okay, $756.
[73:13.80]How many people live here?
[73:16.61]226.
[73:16.65]Alright, where's the tax button?
[73:24.64]Alright, how much electricity should we be using?
[73:29.18]Can we drop the amount of electricity that's allowed?
[73:33.11]I'm at a net negative right now.
[73:35.45]What happened?
[73:36.95]Oh, wow.
[73:37.37]Strawberries are expensive.
[73:39.21]Oh, but still so worth it.
[73:40.47]Strawberry season.
[73:44.65]Shit.
[73:45.77]Okay, so.
[73:46.53]Why?
[73:46.75]I need more commercial buildings.
[73:48.41]What is this?
[73:49.45]Denny's?
[73:53.92]Why is nobody in here?
[73:55.32]Why is nobody going to the store?
[74:03.29]More housing is wanted.
[74:06.97]Hey, look, I got plenty of housing being built.
[74:08.53]Why is nobody going?
[74:09.19]Is there no power over here?
[74:10.07]Yeah, there is.
[74:13.69]This counts, right?
[74:20.58]Look at the three bars.
[74:25.00]No demand for commercial zone.
[74:26.98]Low demand for residential.
[74:28.91]Low demand for industrial.
[74:30.11]Nobody wants anything.
[74:34.70]Okay, let's build some more residential.
[74:38.34]Road.
[74:40.89]I can't just make a road go through somebody's house, can I?
[74:43.39]What happens if I do this?
[74:47.67]It'll destroy that house.
[74:48.59]Alright, that's unnecessary.
[74:50.83]We can go like this.
[74:51.35]A little bit more out here.
[74:58.43]Out here, and then we're going to connect them.
[75:03.03]Not symmetrical.
[75:04.59]Fine.
[75:21.58]It's okay.
[75:22.75]It's okay.
[75:23.91]It's okay.
[75:25.03]Everybody stop.
[75:27.33]Here we go.
[75:29.15]Boom.
[75:31.50]You still want houses now?
[75:32.96]Oh my god, I need money, I need money!
[75:37.64]How much money does this cost?
[75:48.61]Millions.
[75:50.89]Tax, tax, tax.
[75:51.99]I hope it doesn't rain tomorrow.
[75:53.34]No rain.
[75:53.92]Wishing for sunshine.
[75:58.30]Housing brings in money.
[75:59.32]That's true.
[76:00.38]That's true.
[76:01.62]Okay, so let's start by... How's industry looking over here?
[76:05.72]Are we digging?
[76:08.33]Are we constructing?
[76:11.15]Now there's a demand for houses.
[76:12.09]400 people live here.
[76:14.77]More.
[76:14.97]Alright, is there a way I can delete the grid?
[76:17.39]And just look at my city without any... Like to immerse myself in what it looks like?
[76:21.20]How do I do that?
[76:26.10]Click on the X. Oh, there we go.
[76:31.10]Ooh.
[76:32.54]This is really ugly right here, but it's fine.
[76:36.80]This is turning out to be kind of a little place, right?
[76:39.40]This is fine.
[76:43.25]And then from here, we're going to go over this way.
[76:45.57]More residential.
[76:46.89]This will be like the hub.
[76:47.73]How do I build like a fun park?
[76:51.21]I want like a water park right here.
[76:52.75]Can you do that?
[76:58.28]I want to build, like, a water park.
[76:59.58]And then up here... Maybe, like, a curve this way.
[77:07.69]Up here.
[77:09.11]More residential.
[77:09.87]Alright, we need, like, little residential road.
[77:11.43]Lizard road.
[77:12.15]Alright, I'm making money now.
[77:15.51]I'm plus $72.
[77:17.87]My weekly income is $88.
[77:20.37]I'm doing well.
[77:20.99]What's this say?
[77:22.19]We're good.
[77:24.32]Yeah, we're in the green.
[77:25.40]This is good.
[77:27.24]Oh, right.
[77:27.60]Sorry about that.
[77:28.52]I'm sorry.
[77:28.72]I'm sorry about this.
[77:29.94]Little Hamlet.
[77:30.74]For each population of 480.
[77:32.46]Now I get taxes and now I get loans.
[77:35.92]New services.
[77:36.46]Garbage, healthcare, education, and campuses.
[77:56.64]Kylo Ren wanted to say sorry, too.
[77:58.91]Alright, we can get a medical clinic.
[78:00.39]Elementary school.
[78:01.45]Landfill.
[78:02.87]Cycling and community school.
[78:04.43]Oh, we unlock schools.
[78:07.25]I'm looking fucked up today.
[78:08.61]I'm sorry.
[78:10.37]Okay, garbage and industry.
[78:12.62]Healthcare.
[78:13.40]Alright, industry.
[78:14.62]Hey!
[78:17.08]Waste management.
[78:18.58]To manage waste and garbage, build a landfill site or an incineration plant.
[78:23.56]Wait, pause the fucking game, idiot.
[78:28.56]Relax.
[78:30.85]Waste management produces pollution, so the facility should be placed far away from residential areas.
[78:37.99]Garbage that piles up in residential areas also causes ground pollution over time.
[78:43.04]Make sure you have enough garbage facilities.
[78:44.98]Landfill sites and incineration plants send out garbage trucks to pick up trash.
[78:48.80]Make sure they can get around the city easily.
[78:52.12]Good connections with large roads help garbage trucks get around the city fast.
[78:58.64]Okay, we need big roads.
[79:04.27]When placing a building, observe the roads to see how large of an area it will serve efficiently.
[79:08.11]Alright.
[79:11.29]This is a recycling center.
[79:14.22]Yeah, let's do that.
[79:15.48]Oh, this is loud.
[79:16.44]Alright, so this is... Let's do a recycling center.
[79:18.34]Not here.
[79:36.57]It's gotta be like out.
[79:37.51]It's gonna be like a garbage... Alright, up here on the hill will be like the dump.
[79:41.42]It's too expensive.
[79:42.22]What do you mean?
[79:42.76]How much is this?
[79:44.76]It's $16,000.
[79:45.02]How much is this?
[79:45.52]$4,000.
[79:45.54]Is this industry?
[79:56.45]Does industry not give a shit about how loud it is over here?
[80:04.97]They do.
[80:06.00]They don't care.
[80:07.68]Not as much.
[80:08.14]I think I'm going to build another road back here and have just the garbage dumpy over here.
[80:12.44]Yeah, that's the plan.
[80:13.06]Let's go over here.
[80:14.74]It's like industry out here.
[80:17.93]Let's go this way.
[80:19.41]This is where the fucking garbage is.
[80:24.47]Shit, I need a big ass road, don't I?
[80:26.19]Big road.
[80:27.21]Alright, we need a big ass road.
[80:34.88]Six lane road.
[80:36.00]A big ass road up here so they can get up here easily.
[80:41.74]Wait, I need only one way.
[80:43.68]Six lane, one way road.
[80:50.50]Stop.
[80:50.98]Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[80:51.78]Too big, too big, too big.
[80:54.31]How about one of just four lanes?
[80:55.67]This would be good, alright?
[80:57.79]Up here?
[80:59.78]No, no, stop, stop, stop.
[81:00.72]Do you remember why?
[81:01.84]Why one way?
[81:02.36]So they can all... Oh, they can't ever get back in.
[81:05.66]One way trip to the dump.
[81:09.10]You can't... You stuff them all out in a huge six-lane road and they never can come back in.
[81:15.01]Alright, that's good.
[81:19.23]This gives plenty of room for huge dump trucks to come in and out of the fucking dump city.
[81:25.19]Oh, fuck.
[81:25.83]Stop going so fast.
[81:27.99]Health care.
[81:31.16]Keep your citizens healthy, make sure they have enough healthcare facilities and the buildings have good road connections.
[81:37.46]Things such as pollution, crime, there's crime in this game, and contaminated water will reduce the health of your citizens.
[81:43.22]Ambulances travel out to pick up sick people, and patients can also arrive using their own cars.
[81:48.89]Helicopters can reach destinations without road access and are not affected by traffic jams.
[81:53.99]Okay.
[81:54.79]Your citizens age and eventually will perish of old age, no matter how good their health is.
[81:58.97]The living citizens wish to respect their loved ones by having a cemetery in the city to bury them.
[82:03.63]There's a lot in this game.
[82:05.57]Sometimes you get $50.
[82:10.17]I mean, I could be your dad.
[82:13.79]It's possible.
[82:14.37]No, no, no, it's not.
[82:15.27]It's not.
[82:40.52]That implies that... Wow.
[82:45.78]No, I'm not.
[82:46.84]There's no chance I'm your dad, okay?
[82:48.42]I'm 90... I'm 100% positive I'm not your dad.
[83:01.36]Alright, I got it, I get it.
[83:02.42]People are sick, you gotta make, uh, healthcare facilities.
[83:05.92]So.
[83:07.04]Let's make a dump.
[83:08.66]Right here.
[83:10.12]Dump activated.
[83:11.64]Recycling center.
[83:12.54]On the other side.
[83:13.18]And they can fucking, they can be like the Twix Brothers and constantly be in competition.
[83:19.42]No, this is too much money, isn't it?
[83:21.52]That's too much money.
[83:25.49]Do I have more than one?
[83:27.83]Landfill storage.
[83:28.81]I don't think I need more than one right now.
[83:30.83]So that's connected.
[83:31.55]So that is doing... That's fine.
[83:37.68]Okay, now we need medical facility.
[83:42.00]Medical clinic.
[83:44.08]So it should be... There'll be like a little hospital center.
[83:47.70]oh no it's got to be like on the it's gonna be like over here they don't this is not like not noise or anything right large building so that's fine it'll be like right here is that too much is it loud it doesn't say it's loud noise pollution zero what are you talking about it's loud oh that's fine right there look at how happy everybody is
[84:20.41]Oh, the music is loud.
[84:21.80]God, dude.
[84:26.60]Turn it down.
[84:30.16]I don't want to listen to this.
[84:33.36]How about city radio?
[84:36.69]That's alright.
[84:39.35]Okay, so we have our dump.
[84:42.51]Time to play.
[84:42.91]It doesn't need power.
[84:45.97]Wait.
[84:46.63]WAIT.
[84:49.32]Is this a Spider-Man PS4 theme song?
[84:51.73]Alright, this needs power.
[85:01.25]You like jazz?
[85:06.33]So, how much power can one... Okay, I guess I can look, so... Electricity consumption, 10 megawatts.
[85:12.81]Production, 40 megawatts.
[85:14.47]So I'm fine for a while.
[85:15.43]This is already occupied by what?
[85:27.93]Oh my god, have I been delayed this whole time?
[85:32.11]No, thank god.
[85:35.93]I thought my voice was delayed by like a thousand milliseconds because we played The Weed last time.
[85:39.35]Alright, this is good.
[85:42.27]Healthcare for everyone.
[85:43.11]Citizens flock to get treatment for various ailments.
[85:45.41]Blue shots, okay, cool.
[85:48.85]How much can one hospital do?
[85:51.71]Patient zero to 100.
[85:52.49]Alright, so did the garbage trucks see?
[85:57.43]Look, they're coming in and out very, very effectively.
[85:59.20]How much can this do?
[86:02.16]Garbage trucks in use, 215, 0% full.
[86:04.62]So when it's full, what do I do with it?
[86:09.72]This is too epic right now.
[86:12.95]Deep focus.
[86:13.53]That's better.
[86:19.21]Alright, so now we got a new school.
[86:21.60]Education.
[86:22.18]Children need elementary schools.
[86:23.48]Pause it.
[86:24.86]Teenagers attend high school, and young adults can get educated at a university, if one is available.
[86:29.64]Education is complete when a citizen ends their age phase while enlisted in a school.
[86:33.45]Takes time.
[86:36.29]A working school system produces educated adults who can fill high-level jobs in industries and offices, thus raising the city's technology level.
[86:47.03]Observe the roads to see how large of an area will serve it efficiently.
[86:51.17]Public libraries provide entertainment and a small chance for all citizens to become more educated.
[86:56.10]The chance to become more educated decreases with each education level.
[86:58.64]Alright, so we need a... We need an elementary school.
[87:03.48]This is a hospital.
[87:05.00]Elementary school will go... Okay.
[87:10.84]Right next to the hospital.
[87:14.16]Okay, if I plan on having a bunch of more...
[87:18.59]It's going to have to be like back here.
[87:19.77]Alright, the elementary school is going to be like here.
[87:21.31]It's going to be two elementary schools.
[87:24.31]It'll be right here.
[87:24.85]This is going to be... How much money does it cost?
[87:27.53]10,000.
[87:30.43]Alright, you're going to be idiots for a while.
[87:32.23]I need more money.
[87:34.15]Let's go.
[87:34.45]Yeah, you guys are going to be pretty stupid for a little while.
[87:38.23]You don't have any water.
[87:40.75]How the fuck is...
[87:47.31]Oh, I hate it.
[87:48.55]I can't do anything about it.
[87:49.31]It doesn't matter.
[87:49.73]This is my first time.
[87:57.13]Who cares?
[87:57.59]Whatever.
[87:58.01]It's my first time.
[87:59.77]Does this need water up here?
[88:00.65]Does dump need water?
[88:02.61]I mean, that thing looks like shit anyways.
[88:11.40]Alright, I'm $52.
[88:12.58]$52 human people dollars.
[88:13.88]What is this?
[88:14.72]Population.
[88:15.22]Okay.
[88:18.46]Now I can do taxes.
[88:21.78]Here we go.
[88:22.66]Taxes.
[88:24.80]Low density residential zone.
[88:26.68]Okay, tax on income.
[88:31.32]So, $724 a week or a month.
[88:33.60]9% tax.
[88:33.74]We're going to make 12%.
[88:34.50]We're going to do it 12% across the board. 12%.
[88:49.70]Alright, we're going to lower the taxes on the citizens to 7%.
[88:54.94]We're going to raise the taxes on commercial zones.
[89:06.95]We're going to lower the taxes on the people.
[89:12.02]Why is everybody saying Bernie?
[89:13.72]I'm talking about lowering taxes.
[89:23.97]You're doing his voice.
[89:24.99]Was I?
[89:25.55]No, I was not doing his voice.
[89:29.39]I was not doing his voice.
[89:31.05]No, I wasn't.
[89:32.26]Was I a little bit low?
[89:33.82]We're gonna lower the ta- I was.
[89:35.26]A little.
[89:39.80]That was a little bit.
[89:41.10]I- I- It just comes out now.
[89:43.20]Who's leaving?
[89:43.88]Who the fuck are you?
[89:44.42]What are you leaving?
[89:45.22]Oil truck.
[89:46.64]Get back or we need that!
[89:50.62]Wow, this looks like shit.
[89:51.64]I didn't even make this.
[89:52.84]This looks terrible.
[89:58.14]Alright.
[89:58.48]Oh, let's make a tunnel.
[90:00.41]Let's make a tunnel.
[90:01.01]Can I make a tunnel over here?
[90:02.17]No.
[90:02.75]That's too much money.
[90:03.35]I need to start small.
[90:07.97]People are just leaving in droves.
[90:09.74]What?
[90:11.42]Exporting.
[90:12.08]Oh.
[90:12.58]Hot dog.
[90:13.12]Exporting hot dogs.
[90:16.71]Hot dog exporting is our number one export in fucking Wink Dinkville.
[90:22.04]We export hot dogs.
[90:24.74]Imagine that's the number one thing your city is known for, exporting.
[90:30.32]That's an embarrassing Wikipedia article.
[90:33.97]Oh, what's the number one thing that our Wink Dink city is known for?
[90:37.67]It's gotta be infrastructure or maybe electricity or textile.
[90:43.02]You're the number one exporter of hot dog meat.
[90:46.46]Oh, okay.
[90:47.52]Cool, I guess.
[90:49.48]How do I get... Look at those palm trees.
[90:59.93]Rename the city.
[91:00.65]Bottom left of the... Why is this place called Las Vegas?
[91:12.32]What?
[91:18.88]I didn't name it.
[91:22.92]I did not name it.
[91:24.25]No, I didn't.
[91:24.95]You guys have seen the whole thing.
[91:26.61]The whole time.
[91:37.28]It just pulls your IP.
[91:40.16]Oh.
[91:41.70]IP.
[91:44.68]Los Vegas city skylines has tracked your lowest with this money.
[91:48.30]What's it saying money percentage?
[91:49.70]What does that mean was a little bubble?
[91:51.48]Taxes are too high Taxes are too who said that?

[92:37.41]Sorry about your taxes there.
[92:42.16]That was toxic?
[92:43.38]What?
[92:45.04]Was it?
[92:53.24]Unicorn jewelry store.
[92:58.36]That's toxic.
[92:59.72]No, it's... What?
[93:03.14]Wait, is this your truck?
[93:04.70]I will lower your taxes if this is your truck.
[93:07.83]Donut van.
[93:08.43]This is The Simpsons.
[93:12.60]Where's the Simpson house?
[93:13.66]Where's Homer Simpson?
[93:17.34]Alright, stop paying attention.
[93:19.18]What's going on over here?
[93:22.96]Bug spray van.
[93:31.05]They didn't know what to do.
[93:31.91]They got caught up there.
[93:34.13]Alright, how are we looking?
[93:44.12]This guy's on for like a Sunday drive.
[93:46.98]No, this is the only way to leave.
[93:48.16]Right.
[93:51.28]Hold on a second.
[93:53.65]Does the bug spray guy and the donut guy work in the same building?
[93:57.79]I feel like that shouldn't be a thing.
[94:01.43]Why do the bug spray guy and the donut guy both work out of the same shack?
[94:10.20]Okay, let's keep going.
[94:11.52]This is pollution?
[94:12.22]How do I clean this?
[94:14.72]I'm making some money.
[94:15.76]What are the needs?
[94:16.54]More houses.
[94:17.20]Good.
[94:17.42]Let's do some more roads.
[94:20.44]We're doing big, big... Okay, I need a highway.
[94:25.72]Correct me if this is stupid.
[94:27.54]I can't even do a highway.
[94:28.36]I need 2,600 people.
[94:28.78]Okay.
[94:29.00]Two lane road.
[94:29.48]Two lane, one way road.
[94:40.36]Let's get some bigger roads.
[94:42.03]Let's go out here.
[94:43.59]Four lane road.
[94:45.69]No, this is a big hub right here, right?
[94:47.21]I need, uh... I don't, I'm not very good at city planning today.
[94:54.35]I'm gonna go this way.
[94:55.29]Out.
[94:56.12]This is like rent.
[94:57.06]Yeah, this is commercial.
[94:57.88]So we're gonna go from here.
[94:58.60]This is like a big, let's get out of the fucking way here.
[95:03.76]Out here.
[95:04.08]This is a little town.
[95:06.24]Here comes another town.
[95:12.16]Wait, upgrade road.
[95:13.90]Oh, shit.
[95:15.70]I can.
[95:16.62]Should I do this?
[95:17.44]Wait.
[95:17.54]I can upgrade them while they're money.
[95:19.74]It's alright.
[95:20.56]Hold on.
[95:21.12]Oh, what are they doing?
[95:22.18]Oh!
[95:38.32]How do I undo, undo, undo, undo, undo?
[95:39.41]Is there an undo?
[95:39.81]Fuck.
[95:39.91]Control Z. Doesn't work.
[95:40.81]It's okay.
[95:41.09]Whatever.
[95:41.45]This is fine.
[95:42.15]This is like the getting out of the city into the bigger city.
[95:44.63]This is just some little town.
[95:46.13]Okay, so...
[96:07.39]I want to go up here.
[96:09.11]The new one's being built.
[96:09.97]It's fine.
[96:10.35]Alright, we need more houses now.
[96:12.17]Now, now, now, now, now.
[96:14.25]I need enough... Oh, shit.
[96:15.73]I need more power.
[96:17.46]Let me think this out first.
[96:18.50]Hold on.
[96:19.56]I need to... Small road.
[96:28.46]Here.
[96:34.78]If I bring this...
[96:38.02]Down here.
[96:38.74]Because the garbage trucks need better routes, right?
[96:42.20]Let me do a bigger road.
[96:44.26]Because the garbage trucks can't just have one fucking way.
[96:46.74]Do they?
[96:47.18]I mean, they need to have a bigger way to go.
[96:49.12]Four lane road.
[96:51.82]I'm going to go... No, that's fine.
[96:56.80]Okay, whatever.
[96:57.20]I'm just going to go.
[96:58.16]Alright, so this is going to be residential out here.
[97:02.34]Can I upgrade?
[97:03.72]No, I don't want to upgrade.
[97:04.46]Get off the upgrade.
[97:05.18]What the fuck?
[97:08.55]Elevation?
[97:09.55]What did I just do?
[97:12.03]This is going to be all residential.
[97:18.49]Okay.
[97:20.13]Zoning.
[97:20.73]Residential.
[97:25.01]We need more.
[97:25.55]Page up.
[97:27.83]Page up.
[97:31.43]Okay.
[97:31.75]This is alright.
[97:33.78]And we need a little bit more commercial down here.
[97:39.50]We'll need a place to work.
[97:42.37]Yeah, this is like the shopping city center.
[97:52.43]Alright, this is fine.
[97:53.36]Like this.
[97:55.96]Alright, that's a lot of stuff.
[97:57.66]There's still no elementary school.
[97:59.14]Well, just whatever.
[98:00.88]How much is an elementary school?
[98:01.94]Like, a hundred bucks?
[98:05.37]Elementary school.
[98:07.92]Shit, they're gonna be idiots.
[98:10.36]Um, okay.
[98:11.22]How many do I need?
[98:11.78]Two?
[98:13.98]I'm gonna need one out... I need one here.
[98:18.45]Fuck.
[98:31.59]Damn it.
[98:32.14]This is gonna be... Alright, the people at the end of this road are gonna be exponentially stupider than the people at the front of the road.
[98:44.19]These people don't get to... That's not... That's not... I don't have any money.
[98:48.50]Okay.
[98:49.54]I'm out of money.
[98:51.16]Go live.
[98:53.56]What'd you just tweet?
[98:55.94]Mayor supports education.
[98:57.12]Citizens approve of this.
[98:58.68]No more homeschooling.
[98:59.72]Good.
[99:00.12]Okay, cool.
[99:02.36]Let's go.
[99:02.60]Uh, okay.
[99:02.78]Okay.
[99:14.53]There's tons of houses being... Wait, I need infrastructure here.
[99:19.66]This is a fucking stressful game.
[99:23.34]This is a stressful-ass game.
[99:33.86]I'm preparing... Wait, what did the person say?
[99:37.18]The person did not like the taxes?
[99:41.14]Would I live in this city?
[99:42.30]Yeah.
[99:42.90]What's wrong with it?
[99:47.51]What's wrong with living right here?
[99:50.37]Is there a problem with living right here?
[99:53.07]School right across the street.
[99:55.25]Get in the car.
[99:55.95]Drive right down the road.
[99:56.89]There's a fucking Denny's.
[99:59.02]There's a Sky Trust.
[100:00.14]There's a bank.
[100:01.62]Diner.
[100:02.40]People hanging out.
[100:03.22]Why would I not live here?
[100:03.96]What are you talking about?
[100:04.72]This is perfect.
[100:08.70]I should rename this place to Perfectville.
[100:11.11]Perfectville.
[100:16.48]I know you're looking for electricity.
[100:17.64]I gotta wait.
[100:23.13]Worthy Village.
[100:23.75]Here we go.
[100:25.43]Upgraded.
[100:26.57]New features.
[100:27.23]Districts.
[100:28.49]Policies.
[100:30.53]Second loan.
[100:31.61]District specializations.
[100:33.51]And services policies.
[100:34.95]New emergency... Oh, there's no police.
[100:37.77]There's police?
[100:44.50]New industry specializations.
[100:46.94]Self-sufficient building.
[100:50.59]Organic and local produce.
[100:53.23]New power usage policies.
[100:57.65]Water use new buildings.
[100:59.53]Okay, I'm getting overwhelmed.
[101:01.07]Unique buildings?
[101:05.90]Have I unlocked any?
[101:07.96]This...
[101:12.48]I can put the Statue of Liberty in the city.
[101:21.60]Okay, let's put the Statue of Liberty here.
[101:24.62]How much is it?
[101:25.96]Two hundred and ten thousand dollars.
[101:28.47]Should I get a loan to put the Statue of Liberty in the middle of my town?
[101:36.35]Look at how happy everybody will be with the Statue of Liberty.
[101:41.28]No, that's me throwing this into the trash.
[101:45.39]I'm not throwing this away.
[101:46.33]Okay, I need power.
[101:49.53]Do I have another power plant?
[101:50.75]20.
[101:51.33]No, I don't need it yet.
[101:55.61]Can I go from here to here?
[101:57.89]Will it connect?
[101:59.41]As long as I go from here to here, right?
[102:07.17]okay so this one plane is using a shitload of power 21 mw's a second okay cool so that's wait I could have gone from oh
[102:29.03]right I gotta come from here to here or here to here or here to here whatever android and gynoid robot models released sick there's only 21 uh mutatable watts whatever it is how much money do I got
[102:55.87]Now we make the taxes 98% for one day.
[102:59.51]I'm going to solve every... Let's solve every world problem.
[103:02.45]You ready?
[103:03.31]I'm going to make all taxes 95% for two days.
[103:09.21]And then it goes back to normal.
[103:13.81]There you go.
[103:15.45]There you go.
[103:15.77]I just fixed everything.
[103:22.19]I'll take in like 600 million dollars and then I can build like 300 schools up here and have like five more dumps.
[103:30.23]Two more electrical power plants, like five million more houses.
[103:33.09]Is that gonna- will that work?
[103:43.56]And then I can build a statue- what a waste of fucking resources.
[103:51.01]Like, this is why the world doesn't fucking work the way it should.
[103:53.79]You know what I'm saying?
[103:54.89]Because, like, if the governor of fucking Wink-Dinkville got a check for fucking $800 million, he probably would build the Statue of Liberty in his own fucking... Yeah, I decided it was the right thing to do with the city budget this week was to build the Statue of fucking Liberty.
[104:11.64]Two.
[104:16.02]What is Mike?
[104:17.68]No, no, no, no!
[104:20.48]I got it back.
[104:21.14]I got it back.
[104:24.42]Statue of Liberty 2, the sequel.
[104:28.85]And I've never been to the Statue of Liberty before, but there's a sign on it.
[104:34.59]I'll just paraphrase it on mine.
[104:37.23]It says, let's go get everybody over here and have a great day and bring on the fucking, bring on the Red Sox, whatever the fuck it's called.
[104:50.24]That sounds like a good use of city money Police officers small.
[104:56.42]Oh shit.
[104:56.74]I need I need a police officer.
[104:59.20]I need one police officer.
[105:00.42]Okay Fires can occur in your city to prevent wait the city can burn down You have property oh hold on
[105:11.35]They have a fire department.
[105:13.31]In case of fire, the closest fire department building sends out a fire truck.
[105:17.44]But how long it takes to arrive depends on the size of the roads and how well connected areas in the city are.
[105:21.92]So this is... Oh, fuck.
[105:25.28]Oh my god.
[105:26.24]How are these people gonna... If their houses are on fire?
[105:32.56]Depending on the size, multiple... Depending on the size, multiple fire engines can be dispatched to put it out.
[105:43.32]Make a connection.
[105:44.76]So, like, from... like, here to here.
[105:47.74]Oh, that's a great fucking idea.
[105:52.26]Oh, look!
[105:53.84]Who cares about this thing?
[105:54.54]We can go like this.
[105:57.65]Is it gonna delete their house?
[105:58.63]Yep.
[106:01.95]Oh, no, you just got mad because a huge road came in.
[106:04.21]Is that what you were mad about?
[106:05.29]What are you so mad about?
[106:06.29]What?
[106:09.42]That person does not want a big road?
[106:12.88]Why?
[106:13.16]Because it's a busier street now.
[106:23.63]Oh, why?
[106:24.11]Well, you're on the main road.
[106:29.53]Okay.
[106:30.11]Well, that's... Look at how much better... Look at this new traffic pattern.
[106:35.98]Miller Street.

[107:39.75]Um, like, public figures.
[107:41.07]Uh, famous places, right?
[107:43.53]Why is it not, like, famous actors?

[107:51.05]Or, like, Aragorn Way?
[107:53.46]Or, like, Khaleesi Boulevard or something?

[123:26.61]Yeah.
[123:29.25]Okay, what about other parks?
[123:33.35]I don't have enough money for any of this.
[123:37.33]I love the new park.

[124:24.27]Everyone okay?
[124:25.13]How's everybody doing?
[124:26.01]We're good?
[124:26.33]Global happiness is pretty good.
[124:31.95]Connect the road so people aren't a thousand miles from the library.
[124:35.21]Come on.
[124:41.46]What are you talking about?
[124:43.68]How do you need water?
[124:44.48]The one guy that needs water.
[124:46.92]You're right on the one fucking house.
[124:50.84]It doesn't have any utilities.
[124:55.89]God damn it.
[124:57.63]Oh, it's so stupid, but I am gonna do it.
[124:59.91]Whatever.
[125:10.36]Connect the roads so people don't have to drive that far to go to the library in their backyard.
[125:14.96]What?
[125:21.49]People in the southern residential area.
[125:27.06]Oh.
[125:28.58]Connect the top.
[125:31.42]Oh, you mean here.
[125:34.32]Honey, you want to go to the park?
[125:35.76]Yeah, we could go right there.
[125:38.38]Or we could drive across the whole city.
[125:42.35]And end up there.
[125:43.39]Just fucking walk.
[125:46.71]Go out your back door and just walk there.
[125:49.03]What's the problem?
[125:59.40]Well, this person's house is going to get destroyed.
[126:01.26]I didn't like that.

[126:31.73]Alright, that's better.
[126:33.01]This is looking fine.
[126:33.93]I bet you half of you didn't think I was even going to get this far.
[126:37.23]I'm certain that at least 20% of people in this chat right now didn't think I was going to get past how to use the grids.
[126:46.98]Oh, shit.
[126:47.38]What's going on?
[126:47.84]Oh, I need water.
[126:52.52]They have electricity up here, right?
[126:53.70]Yeah.

[126:54.42]Do they?
[126:56.63]Do they?
[126:58.01]Yeah.
[126:58.17]Okay.
[127:03.51]Okay, let me just take a sip of my fucking ice cold coffee.
[127:05.55]Should I do some more crime?
[127:12.58]I think I should do some more crime.
[127:14.36]Especially like over here.
[127:15.90]I'm going to build up this way.
[127:18.17]And then we're going to do a little bit more crime.
[127:23.19]There's literally no crime up here.
[127:25.54]Okay.
[127:27.04]Um, it's all residential.
[127:28.40]All getting built.
[127:28.92]There's a library.
[127:29.46]People aren't gonna be so stupid.
[127:31.42]Uh, let's increase taxes a little bit, please.
[127:34.08]Taxes are gonna be, uh, 12% across the board.
[127:38.64]And 15% for industry.
[127:41.24]Temporarily.
[127:42.36]For a little while.
[127:46.50]Alright, let's go up here.
[127:48.48]Let's look at the grid.
[127:51.76]We need more commercial.
[127:52.74]Let's do some commercial down here.
[127:53.82]Get some more commercial space.
[128:02.40]This is like the whole commercial zone in the middle.
[128:04.56]Yeah, right here.
[128:07.32]Let's go.
[128:09.68]What a great city.
[128:10.46]I would think of dreaming if I didn't know otherwise.
[128:12.87]See?
[128:13.71]Everyone's so happy.
[128:24.10]Alright, that's enough.
[128:25.10]I don't want to go too far up here.
[128:26.16]And then in the middle, I want the Statue of Liberty.
[128:31.62]It was a paid actor.
[128:32.56]That's okay.
[128:32.94]Alright, more.
[128:35.02]What do you think?
[128:35.42]More... Paid actor.
[128:41.59]How's trash?
[128:42.99]Trash is doing okay, right?
[128:44.85]It's only 8% full.
[128:46.15]Yeah, that's not enough.
[128:47.95]City's not big enough.
[128:48.65]Alright, we're gonna start going up to the mountain area.
[128:50.49]Need a high school.
[128:52.27]I don't have enough money for a high school.
[128:55.44]We need to wait.
[129:02.00]It looks pretty efficient.
[129:08.99]Now, now.
[129:10.77]Water?
[129:11.09]Is there no water going over here?
[129:13.01]Oh, shit.
[129:14.89]Oh, there's no fucking electricity over here either.
[129:22.10]It doesn't reach?
[129:25.32]It doesn't reach.
[129:27.56]If I go, like, if I go from here to here, will it reach?
[129:29.96]Oh, no, we're at capacity.
[129:34.01]Okay, uh, I need another... Alright, pause it.
[129:37.21]We're at capacity.
[129:39.97]A little wind farm?
[129:42.39]Cheap and clean energy from the wind.
[129:55.69]I'm assuming this is high wind spots.
[130:00.47]Let's just make like five of them up here.
[130:03.03]And then connect them.
[130:12.52]Does it matter how close these are?
[130:16.80]No, they can be right next to each other?
[130:26.58]Yes, it does.
[130:31.00]No, put them really close together.
[130:32.84]Is that what you do?
[130:33.88]Does it not matter?
[130:34.88]One guy, okay.
[130:35.86]Alright, I'm out of money.
[130:41.22]And now I have to connect from here.
[130:46.22]These are just both producing energy.
[130:50.82]Then go from here to here.
[130:55.20]Done.
[130:55.68]Right?
[130:56.32]That's it.
[130:56.92]Did it.
[131:00.96]Hooray for the mayor!
[131:01.76]More green energy!
[131:03.48]Why is this one not spinning?
[131:07.18]Okay.
[131:09.22]How much?
[131:09.56]What do we produce in here?
[131:16.08]This is working, right?
[131:19.21]56 MWs.
[131:22.51]They think the tax is too high.
[131:25.22]That is why.
[131:27.36]Uneducated.
[131:28.18]We're all dumb.
[131:31.98]Zero available jobs.
[131:33.20]What are they even doing?
[131:35.27]Oh, shit.
[131:35.91]Okay.
[131:36.97]Let's turn the taxes down and turn the education up.
[131:39.63]Turn the... Turn the education up.
[131:42.11]Turn the taxes down.
[131:44.21]We need lower taxes and smarter people.
[131:46.35]Okay, good.
[131:47.55]Taxes.
[131:47.95]12%.
[131:49.50]Alright, is that making you happy?
[131:54.14]Thank you.
[131:57.14]Where's my high school?
[131:58.18]We need at least a high school education.
[132:04.06]High school.
[132:04.56]$24,000.
[132:04.58]It's time to take a loan.
[132:06.00]I need a loan.
[132:08.74]I'll pay it back.
[132:09.24]I don't want to do anything insane.
[132:10.54]Budget.

[132:25.30]Let's take the bu- alright.
[132:27.40]Schools, universities, and campus areas where the high budget can teach more students.
[132:31.62]Here we go.
[132:32.63]This is where we do our city budget.
[132:34.87]Okay.
[132:36.05]Electricity.
[132:38.57]Uh... That's fine.
[132:42.25]Water is fine.
[132:44.19]Garbage?
[132:46.11]We don't need that big of a garbage budget.
[132:50.56]70% on the garbage.
[132:51.76]We don't need that many people doing garbage.
[132:55.78]What's this?
[132:56.10]Medical?
[132:57.14]Healthcare.
[132:57.55]Raise the button for healthcare.
[132:58.27]Let's say we have more vehicles.
[132:59.27]I think we're fine.
[133:02.07]Uh, firemen.
[133:02.91]There hasn't been a fire.
[133:04.69]There has not been a fire yet.
[133:05.83]Okay.
[133:07.61]Prime.
[133:09.10]There's been two robberies.
[133:11.52]There's only been a few robberies.
[133:13.28]This is a safe place.
[133:14.90]Okay, education.
[133:15.78]We need more education.
[133:21.01]More education.
[133:23.49]A lot more.
[133:24.01]Okay.

[142:07.65]What?
[142:09.63]Garbage is piling up.
[142:10.59]Uneducated.
[142:13.67]Okay.
[142:14.59]If we did that uneducated, trash to you is taking the bag of trash and opening the nearest window and throwing the trash bag out of the window.
[142:24.26]That's trash.
[142:26.02]Oh, okay.
[142:34.12]Okay.

[143:02.03]Take down the parks.
[143:07.26]More education.
[143:08.98]130%.
[143:09.02]This is a lot of money.
[143:10.78]That's too much money.
[143:15.60]That's a lot of money.
[143:22.04]Keep it at 120.
[143:22.58]Okay.
[143:28.08]Okay, we need to tax.
[143:29.46]Taxes.
[143:30.98]What's this?
[143:31.74]High-density residential zone.
[143:34.20]High-density?
[143:35.10]Low-density?
[143:37.87]Oh, I can do high density?
[143:41.39]What the fuck?
[143:42.17]What does that mean?
[143:44.51]Low density residential zone.
[143:50.48]What is it?
[143:51.06]Wait, what is this?
[143:53.00]Paint the part of the city you want to become a district.
[143:57.54]New districts will be named automatically, but can be renamed later.
[144:00.50]Apply special policy by selecting and clicking the district.
[144:06.03]Remove districts by painting areas with the secondary mouse button.
[144:09.43]District specializations allow buildings to be replaced by specialized industrial and commercial facilities.
[144:15.52]Specialized buildings can benefit from different natural resources or focus on tourism.
[144:27.91]Okay.
[144:29.27]Park area?
[144:32.27]Oh, wait.
[144:35.44]I can make a... just paint in here a park?
[144:39.22]Just paint this?
[144:40.44]Will this just be like a park zone?
[144:44.56]Is this stupid?
[144:49.74]Paint district.
[144:50.50]Is this too small?
[144:55.91]Industry area.
[145:00.83]Or... I...
[145:02.96]Where to land?
[145:03.60]This is, okay, this is a little too much for my brain right now.
[145:06.56]Let me just focus on, like, buildings, elementary schools for a minute.
[145:11.43]Uh, I'll come back to this in, like, a year.
[145:19.10]Okay, um, I need houses.
[145:22.76]Residential, I think.
[145:23.66]Yeah, we need another power plant, I think.
[145:29.88]Okay.
[145:31.34]Road.
[145:31.64]Let's go with... I don't have highways yet, which sucks.
[145:36.81]But this is an exit.
[145:37.49]It could be a new town over... Let's... Alright.
[145:43.65]Fuck.
[145:45.91]I'm overwhelmed.
[145:46.77]Slow down.
[145:47.83]Relax.
[145:48.13]I'm overwhelmed.
[145:50.71]Okay.
[145:51.01]I'm getting over... Here we are.
[145:52.62]Just taking a minute here.
[145:56.48]I want... Residential up here.
[146:01.74]Okay.
[146:02.88]Okay, I didn't want to build a residential down here, so it's nice and residential.
[146:08.77]Connect the highway over here.
[146:10.57]New city is going to go out this way.
[146:15.97]Sounds good to me.
[146:16.85]Here we go.
[146:17.43]People are going to get removed, but what do you want to do?
[146:38.93]Ah, this looks like shit.
[146:47.58]Build a tunnel?
[146:48.94]Just for fun?
[146:49.88]Hold on, so build- wait.
[146:54.80]Page down, right?
[147:10.70]Page down.
[147:20.05]No, this is stupid.
[147:21.71]This is like the secret base residential area.
[147:26.77]This is so much money to build like a secret entrance for a new residential area up here.
[147:35.33]Up in like the hills.
[147:42.74]Is it worth it?
[147:43.24]It's worth it.
[147:44.68]This is a secret residential area up here.
[147:48.30]What's going on with your coins?
[147:55.83]I can't be total fuckface right now.
[147:59.81]God damn it!
[148:00.59]I did it.
[148:01.83]I shouldn't have done that, but I did it.
[148:03.13]Alright, now we gotta get out of here and have the opening for the private zone.
[148:09.68]Okay.
[148:10.62]Now pull it up.
[148:11.96]Page up.
[148:14.06]It's too steep.
[148:22.30]How do I bring it up?
[148:26.23]Page up?
[148:32.67]Why can I not get out of this?
[148:34.63]What are you guys doing?
[148:36.18]Where's that road?
[148:46.20]How come I can't page up?
[148:47.86]I can't come out?
[148:48.54]Space is occupied.
[148:50.13]It's too steep.
[148:52.87]What the fuck are you talking about?
[149:04.81]What's that road?
[149:05.43]How come I can't see it anymore?
[149:07.45]Oh, okay.
[149:17.98]Okay, here we go.
[149:18.96]Good job.
[149:20.24]Here we go.
[149:20.58]Got it.
[149:23.16]This is so fucking stupid.
[149:26.50]What a waste of, like, $40,000 to have, like, the weird private entrance.
[149:34.07]What the fuck?
[149:39.41]Okay.
[149:45.41]Cool.
[149:48.13]These people are not gonna be able to have any education.
[149:57.42]Wait, I can do this though.
[150:06.49]Space is already occupied.
[150:16.96]Channel points.
[150:18.74]What the hell are you guys doing?
[150:27.30]We're selling.
[150:28.38]We don't... We don't need no control.
[150:31.58]Further, we crave... It's just a purple chat room.
[150:38.96]Well, you guys are wasting your channel points.
[150:41.28]The next fucking channel point stream is coming up.
[150:43.46]It's going to be 10,000 channel points per burp.
[150:47.32]And whoa, sorry, you're not going to be able to get me to burp.
[150:55.15]Oh, sorry about that.
[150:56.13]And now it's canceled.
[151:20.68]Why are they unhappy?
[151:21.76]What?
[151:21.98]I just did the same thing over here.
[151:29.66]I just mirrored the exact same layout over here.
[151:36.73]Except it's a tunnel.
[151:41.69]Why did I fucking do that?
[151:43.43]What a waste of time.
[151:47.89]Secret Batman entrance.
[151:50.63]Alright, whatever.
[151:51.41]Who cares?
[151:55.81]It doesn't matter.
[151:56.48]It looks like shit.
[151:57.42]Do you think I care?
[152:01.22]It doesn't matter.
[152:01.84]It needs to be a slightly different layout.
[152:03.60]There we go!
[152:07.72]And there needs to be a road connecting this to here.
[152:10.88]Done.
[152:11.38]Fuck!
[152:12.50]No, this sucks!
[152:14.34]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, I can fix it, I can fix it, I can fix this.
[152:17.47]This is like... This is the design that your fucking three-year-old nephew does on the back of the fucking Chili's children's menu card.
[152:36.97]And this is like, what are you drawing over there?
[152:39.81]It's a rabbit.
[152:41.57]Oh wow, that looks just like a fucking rabbit.
[152:43.95]That doesn't look at all like a rabbit.
[152:45.83]Yeah, but I see it kind of.
[152:49.03]You're trying.
[152:50.11]I need the big road.
[152:57.63]Two-way road, here it is.
[152:58.65]Upgrade, upgrade, upgrade.
[153:11.42]Alright, now this breaks up into residential zones.
[153:17.97]Buy, buy money.
[153:19.13]It doesn't matter.
[153:20.15]I'll get it all back.
[153:20.77]I'm going to put taxes at 100% for one day.
[153:24.55]This is just a stupid idea.
[153:26.61]Alright, elect plumbing.
[153:31.22]Okay, plumbing.
[153:32.64]Here we go.
[153:33.44]From here.
[153:43.77]good from here to here up here is this correct?
[153:55.28]I think I'm doing this wrong
[154:04.06]It's not symmetrical.
[154:05.36]It's not symmetrical.
[154:06.36]No, no, no.
[154:08.80]Fix your Discord server.
[154:10.10]What the fuck?
[154:10.50]I don't know what... What are you talking... I don't even know what that means.
[154:14.64]It keeps crashing.
[154:22.09]I didn't do... It's not like I didn't pay the Discord internet bill.
[154:27.29]It's just Discord's doing that.
[154:28.79]Discord's...
[154:32.26]I'm holding two cords that aren't plugged in together and they can't be plugged in.
[154:35.66]What do you want me to do?
[154:36.90]What a waste.
[154:37.34]Forget this.
[154:52.93]How much?
[154:54.51]Okay.
[154:55.51]Water's going fine.
[154:58.01]So far.
[154:58.45]I'm gonna have to need a new pump or something.
[155:01.88]Turn this off.
[155:03.38]Wait, no, no, no!
[155:06.14]That's the one I can't play, right?
[155:07.08]That's the only one I can't click on.
[155:08.22]How about, um... Downtown Radio.
[155:14.97]Sewer... Sewage production.
[155:16.61]Sewage drainage.
[155:17.69]Alright, we're doing fine.
[155:20.94]Water reserve and tanks.
[155:21.96]None.
[155:22.16]I don't have any water tanks.
[155:27.14]Okay, so... Wait, what year is it?
[155:30.53]2021, okay.
[155:32.09]Not any electricity.
[155:35.97]This is a problem.
[155:36.95]We're going to fix this.
[155:44.13]Now let's let this play out so they can build up.
[155:47.82]Remember, this is all residential and a couple of schools.
[155:50.72]I don't have any money.
[155:54.04]They're all gonna be idiots again.
[156:08.59]I have to increase the fuck out of taxes.
[156:38.11]Imagine living here and paying 20% property taxes every month.
[156:43.91]VOD mute?
[156:45.91]I didn't get the mute warning for this.
[156:51.76]Start building.
[156:53.68]No educated people.
[156:57.10]I didn't know that was going to be that important.
[156:58.76]I didn't know.
[156:59.34]I thought it was just build town.
[157:00.70]I didn't know you had to make people smart and shit.
[157:07.38]Businesses are being abandoned because no one is... Boomtown!
[157:19.87]Ooh.
[157:21.17]Okay, I can do ferry, taxi, post service, a bus.
[157:26.07]Alright, I need to make money.
[157:26.97]How the fuck am I gonna make any money?
[157:35.72]Uh-oh.
[157:45.37]There's only one guy over here who's not gonna have internet!
[157:48.11]Fuck!
[157:48.43]I gotta build all the whole internet infrastructure to get over to this guy!
[157:51.37]Okay, we're good.
[158:02.98]They don't like- I don't want these taxes!
[158:04.74]Holy shit, we're making a ton of money!
[158:07.14]Just bear with me, everybody!
[158:08.52]Bear with me!
[158:10.10]We're just gonna have a bunch of taxes for one or two more days, and then we'll go back to normal, I promise.
[158:25.14]Okay, okay.
[158:27.02]See?
[158:28.60]Now I'm gonna lower your taxes to 11%.
[158:30.74]See?
[158:33.80]That's all we had to do.
[158:43.89]Not enough educated workers.
[158:46.13]One job available.
[158:47.08]How many people are in the high school?
[158:49.00]Wait, I need like a college or something.
[158:51.56]What does this thing mean?
[158:53.28]Not enough goods to sell.
[158:56.73]What?
[158:56.83]What do you mean I don't have goods?
[158:58.87]I don't have any more industry.
[159:01.87]How much industry am I making?
[159:04.52]Everybody is an idiot.
[159:06.72]They're all gonna... They're gonna start eating each other.
[159:10.26]Nobody... How are they driving?
[159:13.54]How are you driving cars?
[159:17.39]They're all so stupid.
[159:18.67]You just ran over four people.
[159:24.40]There's not enough boxes from the box factory.
[159:26.94]What?
[159:28.98]Okay, hold on.
[159:30.32]I got money now.
[159:31.49]Electricity.
[159:34.35]Let's go here to here to here.
[159:40.83]Fuck.
[159:46.52]Got it.
[159:49.34]Good.
[159:49.44]Right?
[159:50.06]Right?
[159:52.66]55.
[159:52.90]Oh shit.
[159:53.84]I need more of these.
[159:58.26]I need another wind.
[160:00.20]More wind.
[160:03.34]Good.
[160:04.40]Another one.
[160:08.13]Green energy.
[160:11.11]That's it.
[160:11.45]That's it.
[160:11.79]One more.
[160:13.63]Last one.
[160:18.43]Okay.
[160:19.36]Good.
[160:24.51]You must construct additional pylons.
[160:28.81]Not enough goods to sell, but from where?
[160:33.30]Where do you really pull goods from?
[160:34.62]Our vacation was extended.
[160:35.68]Whatever.
[160:36.86]Do I not have enough industry?
[160:41.30]Oh, okay.
[160:41.84]So we need medium demand for industry.
[160:43.84]Alright.
[160:46.04]Industry's going up this way.
[160:47.11]Let's go.
[160:50.09]Excuse me.
[160:50.65]Move.
[160:51.19]Excuse me.
[160:51.61]Move.
[160:51.81]Move.
[160:53.56]Ooh.
[160:54.84]Two-lane road with tram tracks.
[160:57.92]I don't care.
[161:00.76]Okay, here we go.
[161:02.38]Can I upgrade?
[161:02.90]I don't want to upgrade.
[161:03.64]I want to replace it. ...
[161:26.24]Um, okay.
[161:32.57]Industry.
[161:36.17]Get it way the fuck away from everybody.
[161:41.37]Good.
[161:41.77]Now we'll have a bunch more goods.
[161:50.59]I'm gonna need more power plants and shit.
[161:52.46]Okay, we'll let that build out.
[161:53.84]We'll just keep going.
[161:57.59]Let's just look.
[161:59.87]We need more industry.
[162:00.59]It's coming.
[162:01.59]I promise.
[162:02.03]Do I know what a neighborhood looks like in real life?
[162:07.41]Yes.
[162:08.98]I just... I don't zoom out on Google Earth and look at every neighborhood.
[162:17.28]Every neighborhood... You know what?
[162:18.26]Yeah.
[162:18.54]Every neighborhood looks like this to me.
[162:23.17]I... I don't look at my... I don't walk out my door and see this.
[162:34.16]I told you I'm not a fucking city planner.
[162:35.82]I already told you that.
[162:37.28]I don't know what the hell I'm doing.
[162:38.34]I don't know what, like, sufficiency and efficiency is.
[162:41.71]I'm just going with, rolling with punches and making houses and making secret centers.
[162:48.01]Nobody even lives over here.
[162:57.27]I need more commercial, I think, soon.
[162:58.45]Alright, build this shit up.
[163:00.93]We need water.
[163:12.93]I thought I could do it.
[163:13.57]I thought I could make a V. It's alright.
[163:19.32]I'm not a fucking city planner.
[163:20.52]Fuck it.
[163:21.96]Here we go.
[163:22.70]How about electric?
[163:28.40]Alright, pause it.
[163:29.37]This needs to change.
[163:30.13]This is terrible.
[163:32.51]Terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible, terrible.
[163:46.36]Okay, there we go.
[163:48.43]That's good.
[163:49.13]Connected.
[163:50.55]Good and connected.
[163:53.23]Good and connected.
[163:55.75]Good and connected.
[163:58.45]Looks good.
[164:00.78]Electricity's going there.
[164:02.30]Plumbing's going here.
[164:03.06]Keep it going.
[164:08.34]Add some city policies.
[164:11.15]What the fuck is a policy?
[164:13.45]Uh...
[164:15.13]Wait, wait, wait, I'm trying to pause the game.
[164:18.79]Where's that tooltip?
[164:20.89]Policies can be used to add some flavor.
[164:24.39]Adjust where certain citizen types live, what they can do, what sort of industries allowed, set policies.
[164:31.40]It can be set citywide or limited to districts created with the district tool.
[164:37.21]Okay, so power usage.
[164:40.27]Energy conservation is important.
[164:42.39]The best way to do that is by installing energy meters in buildings.
[164:46.55]Moderately reduced electricity consumption.
[164:48.37]I don't need that right now.
[164:52.39]Pet ban.
[164:55.05]Smoking ban?
[164:59.13]Make this a smoke-free city?
[165:03.69]The whole city is smoke-free.
[165:09.63]Alright, that sounds like not a bad idea.
[165:11.11]Alright, the whole city is smoke-free.
[165:13.36]You cannot smoke cigarettes in this whole city.
[165:19.48]Prefer ferries.
[165:20.58]High ticket prices.
[165:26.04]Park made... Free Wi-Fi!
[165:28.56]Free wireless access points for citizens and tourists allow easy use of email and other internet services instead of traditional mail.
[165:34.88]This reduces the amount of mail...
[165:37.50]Let's go, yeah, free Wi-Fi in the whole city.
[165:40.50]Nobody has, it's all free Wi-Fi.
[165:47.29]Okay, and... smoke detector.
[165:51.93]Recreational marijuana.
[165:55.01]Allowing recreational use of controlled substances attracts more tourists, but also requires more police presence.
[166:03.49]Increase police budget by 15%.
[166:04.93]Reduces crime rate.
[166:06.55]Moderately increases tourism.
[166:09.09]No, we're going to have free Wi-Fi and no smoking.
[166:14.50]Sounds good.
[166:16.88]Alright.
[166:18.66]Am I making an entire city or am I doing the policy that's inside of a McDonald's?
[166:25.31]This is a city-wide thing.
[166:34.01]I don't fucking know what the hell I'm doing at this point.
[166:35.37]Alright, let's go.
[166:36.43]I'm not legalizing weed.
[166:37.95]Not yet.
[166:39.31]Not yet.
[166:40.05]I can't have no... I can't ban smoking and then make weed legal.
[166:45.93]No smoking allowed!
[166:47.05]And, well, you can smoke, but only... Well, no cigarettes, but you smoke weed.
[166:51.49]You can?
[166:53.15]Who are you to say what I can't... What about how... Who said that?
[166:55.87]Who are you to say what I can do?
[166:57.15]What's next?
[166:57.75]Ban sandals with socks?
[166:59.17]Not cool.
[166:59.83]I want freedom.
[167:20.71]Alright, let's go.
[167:21.83]How's this look?
[167:23.09]Industry coming up.

[168:33.93]Riot.
[168:34.41]Riot.
[168:34.89]Riot.
[168:36.39]We can keep rioting.

[169:36.60]Fair.
[169:36.70]Okay.
[169:53.36]Just put more stupid people stores.
[170:00.42]I don't know.
[170:01.06]There's not enough educated workers.
[170:03.66]Not enough goods.
[170:06.55]I need to just build dumb people's stores.
[170:10.87]I don't know.
[170:13.03]Stuff that anybody can do.
[170:19.76]I need to put something in here, too.
[170:21.98]Can I just put anything in here?
[170:23.34]Terrain.
[170:25.20]Modify the terrain.
[170:28.34]Oh, no, no, no.
[170:29.12]I'm not fucking with this.
[170:33.05]I'm not fucking with that, no way.
[170:34.96]What's this?
[170:36.10]Basketball court!
[170:37.18]Oh, sick!

[170:45.32]Uh... What's the green over here mean?
[170:50.61]Oh, that just, it hits everybody in that area, okay.
[170:53.77]But like right here, right in the middle.
[170:54.93]I don't know if Bull does any house though.
[170:57.71]Okay, right here.
[171:00.62]There we go.
[171:01.44]Nice, everyone's happy about that shit.
[171:05.39]Small playground.
[171:06.81]Small park.
[171:07.55]Playground.
[171:09.07]Put a playground over here.
[171:09.89]Hit this area.
[171:13.77]Right there.
[171:14.45]Here we go.
[171:17.43]See?
[171:21.00]Good.
[171:22.10]Feeling full of energy after a jog in the new park.
[171:29.24]Riot.
[171:29.58]Fuck the mayor.
[171:30.14]We want to smoke weed on the basketball court.
[171:32.20]That's too bad.
[171:34.49]That's pretty cool, though.
[171:35.31]Look at that.
[171:39.02]Do I collect money from this?
[171:42.34]Wait, hold on.
[171:45.60]Ship?
[171:46.08]I don't have any ship.
[171:48.20]Wars.
[171:51.33]Just the budget for the road maintenance.
[172:00.03]Okay.
[172:00.87]Now.
[172:01.07]What do I need?
[172:05.83]Got houses going up.
[172:07.73]How come they haven't built anything?
[172:08.61]Oh, I need plumbing and power over here.
[172:10.86]Is that why this isn't up?
[172:11.60]Alright, we're going to come down here.
[172:16.96]And this is going to be more commercial.
[172:20.14]More commercial down this way.
[172:24.90]Whoa, what's this?
[172:25.50]Bus?
[172:26.28]Four lane road with bus lanes.
[172:30.08]That's kind of cool.
[172:31.74]So you can take the bus.
[172:32.46]Alright, you can take the bus from here.
[172:35.93]All the way down to here.
[172:38.29]There's a bus.
[172:43.96]Bus or taxi?
[172:44.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[172:45.88]Yeah, bus.
[172:48.14]So the bus, you can get on the bus in the middle of the city.
[172:55.22]So let's say that you could get on the bus here.
[172:57.63]This is a good place for a bus stop.
[173:00.19]It's gonna destroy two businesses.
[173:09.02]You can't just connect it.
[173:09.88]You can't just make a new exit with a bus.
[173:13.85]Alright, we're gonna have to delete that for a minute.
[173:17.59]How are people still so stupid?
[173:22.15]I have plenty of high schools now.
[173:24.61]What's going on over here?
[173:27.37]Not enough workers.
[173:33.72]What?
[173:33.94]Build churches?
[173:37.08]Build churches?
[173:41.58]I don't have enough money for that.
[173:44.46]Healthcare.
[173:48.72]Build a university.
[173:50.56]How much is a university?
[173:52.15]Public library.
[173:55.13]Institute of Creative Arts, 30,000.
[173:58.53]I can't build, it's too much money.
[174:00.11]Okay, hold on.
[174:04.92]We'll be looking out on the grid.
[174:09.59]Still need to build this up here.
[174:11.94]Just go fast.
[174:12.64]Really fast.
[174:13.26]And make the taxes fucking crazy.
[174:15.64]Just make it 100% taxes.
[174:18.90]Right?
[174:19.12]Would that be a stupid idea for like a few minutes?
[174:21.14]Alright, here we go.
[174:29.56]Just for a little bit.
[174:32.96]Just until I get to $100,000.
[174:37.72]When you start seeing, like, hey, hey, hey, I don't like this.
[174:43.28]Okay, I don't like that.
[174:44.02]Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay.
[174:45.76]Okay, okay, alright, alright, alright.
[174:52.33]Imagine getting a letter in the mail on, like, a week-to-week basis.
[174:56.43]Hello, this is Mayor Elbertson.
[174:58.35]Just wanted to make sure everyone's aware that this week taxes are going up 12%.
[175:04.86]And then next week, hello there, Elverson again.
[175:07.62]Taxes are going down 12%.
[175:08.74]He would not live here.
[175:11.20]He'd get the fuck out of here as soon as he could.
[175:14.54]Not enough goods to sell.
[175:15.98]Not enough workers.
[175:16.88]16 out of 16 workers.
[175:21.93]I need more people to build the houses.
[175:30.33]Ice Cube Factory?
[175:34.25]We don't need this.
[175:35.39]We don't need an ice cube factory, okay?
[175:40.12]What a fucking scam business.
[175:41.98]That's not even real.
[175:44.68]This is a shell company.
[175:50.98]I need workers.
[175:51.71]Alright, I need people.
[175:52.67]Where's my total population?
[175:56.71]I got houses going up, man.
[176:00.81]I got houses going up.
[176:08.57]Income from residential zones.

[176:26.01]We need more residential.
[176:26.85]Alright, let's go.
[176:27.85]I'm doing a ton more buildings.
[176:29.01]We got $29,000.
[176:30.82]Highway exit's gonna take us this way.
[176:32.28]Alright, you're gonna get on the highway.
[176:37.66]And you're gonna...
[176:39.45]Fucking go over here.
[176:42.55]There you go.
[176:47.21]From there.
[176:50.53]We got... What are you gonna...
[177:11.91]Go on the highway.
[177:13.67]I can just build this out this way.
[177:17.97]This is cursed.
[177:21.15]Instead of going on the highway, just build this road down here.
[177:24.51]It says down and around.
[177:27.56]I gotta go visit grandma.
[177:30.68]I gotta go.
[177:31.66]One exit on the highway and she lives down the street from me.
[177:36.33]Everything's abandoned.
[177:38.13]Why are there no people?
[177:42.04]Where are the firefighters?
[177:45.80]Where are the firefighters?
[177:48.04]What?
[177:48.28]Oh, shit.

[178:51.48]This is all too much money.
[178:52.80]Alright, one more- Just- Okay, fine, fine, done, done, done, done, done.

[179:05.00]Who comes back and, like, replants the park?
[179:12.32]Holy shit, this is depressing.
[179:17.16]Educated teen.
[179:18.34]I can't even, man.
[179:31.81]What's this?
[179:34.59]Abandoned.
[179:38.33]Build something else.
[179:40.53]There's too much trash.
[179:41.59]There's too much everything.
[179:44.01]They need more educated people.
[179:48.47]The person's happy.
[179:52.33]Oh shit.
[179:58.21]Yep.
[180:02.07]Okay.
[180:02.81]Fuck off.
[180:04.80]Build something else.
[180:06.58]This was trash, trash, trash.
[180:08.64]What's wrong with the trash?
[180:10.06]I need another dump?
[180:13.48]Landfill storage.
[180:16.25]Garbage capacity.
[180:18.59]Garbage production.
[180:19.19]1,000 units.
[180:24.25]Should I put this down?
[180:25.23]Do I need another one?
[180:25.85]I don't think I need another one.
[180:32.76]Processing status?
[180:37.97]Why are people abandoning the town?
[180:41.03]Stop abandoning me!
[180:43.19]Who are you to say what I say I can't do?
[180:44.83]You're gonna smoke in the park and burn it down.
[180:46.27]Great, thanks a lot, big head.
[180:48.12]Alright, fine.
[180:49.16]Fine, fine, fine, fine, fine.

[180:53.00]You can smoke again.
[180:53.92]And no more, you know what?
[180:55.96]No more free Wi-Fi, though.
[180:57.98]I'm taking that back.
[180:59.58]No more free Wi-Fi.
[181:06.88]Oh, fuck.
[181:07.42]I have to delete this.
[181:21.33]Did I waste it?
[181:22.59]Delete.
[181:23.11]Oh, it's okay.

[181:27.76]It's trash.
[181:29.14]Alright, put education down.
[181:30.26]They're all idiots anyways.
[181:33.23]There we go, right, we got enough?
[181:35.15]How much trash are you producing?
[181:41.77]That's not a historical building, it's just some guy's house, okay.
[181:48.03]Uh, hold on.
[181:48.88]Let me turn the fucking music down.
[181:55.92]Wait, a little bit more.
[181:59.38]Okay, that's good.
[182:00.88]Alright, we're good, good, good, good, good.
[182:04.63]Wasn't that funny when I fucking made this and wasted $35,000?
[182:06.79]There's no use for it.
[182:09.99]There's nothing even happening here.
[182:11.37]They're not building over here.
[182:15.11]Okay, how we doing?
[182:16.53]We need workers.
[182:19.88]I need houses.
[182:21.18]Oh my god, I'm so bad at this.

[182:25.02]Alright, here we go.
[182:26.08]We're going out this way.
[182:28.02]It's so fun though.

[183:24.61]Alright, we need more income.
[183:28.73]Okay, fuck.

[183:39.12]I wanna connect this shit.
[184:10.08]Okay.
[184:14.50]That looks alright.
[184:19.62]No, stop at the curb.
[184:20.88]What do you mean, what the fuck is that?
[184:29.47]It's a bunch of residential fucking houses going here.
[184:55.49]This is too scuffed.
[184:59.10]Just stop.
[184:59.70]Relax.
[185:00.14]That's my first time.
[185:01.04]I've never played it.
[185:02.28]I've never played a city builder.
[185:03.74]I'm trying to go for it.
[185:05.68]I'm going for it.
[185:07.14]This is my first time ever playing a city game.
[185:11.30]I need houses.
[185:13.21]A lot of them.
[185:24.34]And I'm putting... I'm putting schools and shit in here?
[185:27.46]Wait, can you live... Is this a doghouse?
[185:41.78]I don't understand.
[185:43.76]Okay.

[189:35.43]Double the power.
[189:50.82]Put it over here.
[189:58.68]This is industry.
[189:59.26]They don't give a shit.
[189:59.86]Okay, now... How much is this generating?
[190:04.68]40.
[190:06.44]Let's take a look at our graph.
[190:09.38]Electricity production, 136.
[190:10.82]We're good.
[190:12.06]We're connected.
[190:13.04]We're good to go.
[190:15.99]How does nobody have trash?
[190:18.93]Do I need another one?
[190:19.73]I need a second trash facility.
[190:22.77]Trash facility.
[190:25.03]Pause it.
[190:27.29]How much trash do I fucking have?
[190:31.17]Services.
[190:32.63]Transport.
[190:34.91]My trash budget.
[190:35.71]Didn't I just put it up?
[190:37.07]Okay.
[190:43.74]What do they need?
[190:45.82]Getting educated.
[190:46.50]Good.
[190:47.48]Good to see.
[190:51.72]Trash gang.
[190:57.68]Because my capacity is still fine for the dump.
[191:01.94]It's 38% full.
[191:02.98]Okay.
[191:03.20]I'm going to make another one.
[191:05.51]I'm making another landfill.
[191:14.79]Yeah.
[191:16.19]Let's go.
[191:16.77]Perfect.
[191:18.01]As these houses start to get made... You are the dump.
[191:27.10]Poop ground.
[191:27.64]What do you mean, poop ground?
[191:38.90]Shit.
[191:39.64]I'm gonna put this over here.
[191:41.10]Alright, new plan, new plan, new plan, new plan.
[191:42.71]Sell this.
[191:44.81]Move it.
[191:45.19]How do I move it?
[191:46.51]Relocate.
[191:47.07]Come here.
[191:49.87]Holy shit, what a 9 million IQ play this is.
[191:54.11]That secret entrance is not to another house.
[191:56.93]That secret entrance is to the dump.
[192:07.65]See?
[192:07.85]Look at that.
[192:09.56]They go down into their own trash hole.
[192:16.86]See?
[192:18.08]You don't have to see them.
[192:19.20]All the trash goes underneath your neighborhood.
[192:24.14]I should do two of these.
[192:26.56]Alright, 10,000.
[192:28.82]How we doing?
[192:29.74]Good, good, good, good, good.
[192:30.52]We need water.
[192:31.04]We need electricity.
[192:31.86]Someone's screaming at me for electricity.
[192:34.63]What's the issue here?
[192:36.55]Not connected.
[192:38.55]Well, you will be in about five seconds.
[192:40.85]Alright, and then you're connected there.
[192:47.45]And then you connect... Just build house!
[192:49.88]Just build!
[192:50.42]Build!
[192:50.76]Build!
[192:56.25]How do you not have any water?
[192:58.63]What the fuck are you talking about?
[192:59.71]Wait, you don't have... What?
[193:02.35]What happened?
[193:04.55]Oh shit, I need another water pump.
[193:11.71]This is a water pump.
[193:13.23]Water pumping station.
[193:16.64]Wait, what is this?
[193:18.22]Oh, that's the dirty water.
[193:19.34]Don't touch that.
[193:24.90]Bingo.
[193:26.33]Right?
[193:27.88]Is that correct?
[193:28.36]There we go.
[193:30.12]Yeah, we're good.
[193:30.52]Alright, everyone's being a little bit more happy.
[193:38.44]Is it not connected?
[193:39.06]It should be, right?
[193:39.70]Was it not connected?
[193:41.88]No, it is.
[193:42.24]That's connected, isn't it?
[193:46.93]No, see?
[193:47.29]240,000.
[193:47.33]It is.
[193:51.87]What about the poop?
[193:54.17]Drain capacity.
[193:54.99]Let's take a look.
[193:56.65]Sewage production.
[193:57.79]Ooh.
[194:05.91]Here we go.
[194:06.37]Right?
[194:13.89]Right?
[194:16.15]I don't understand how you still have all this trash.
[194:23.23]How many trucks are in use?
[194:24.53]16?
[194:25.23]I need another dump facility over here.
[194:26.59]I have to.
[194:28.93]I'm running out of time.
[194:31.13]I'm out of time.
[194:37.54]Busy town.
[194:39.44]More policies.
[194:40.80]Unique buildings.
[194:41.44]Sightseeing tours.
[194:42.46]Oil industry and tourism.
[194:46.54]Hey, I was doing something.
[194:51.59]Back to back.
[194:55.54]Come see the secret dump.
[194:58.74]That's no fucking electricity.
[195:00.83]Wait, whose house is this?
[195:07.45]Wait, is this like a farm?
[195:09.13]Is this the guy that owns the dump?
[195:14.25]This is like, it's a farm.
[195:16.15]Okay.
[195:17.65]Uh, here we go.
[195:18.65]Now we connect here to here.
[195:23.29]That's got electricity.
[195:24.13]This needs water, too.
[195:25.77]Water is coming out here.
[195:26.67]What are you fucking talking about?
[195:27.65]A secret poop farm.
[195:33.23]Well, you know, uh... Some people... Some people have... You know, milk, dairy production.
[195:39.67]Some people have... Corn and maize and all that.
[195:44.35]Nah, for me, nah.
[195:45.91]It's all... It's trash.
[195:52.01]Trash farm.
[195:55.68]What's wrong with our garbage collections?
[195:56.96]Trash is piling up, it's flying everywhere!
[196:00.02]I'm... Sixty- I need enough- Do I actually need more of these?
[196:06.41]We'll fucking just make another one right here.
[196:08.53]I'm doing another one.
[196:12.53]Just stack them all up here and have this guy have a farm.
[196:16.75]Fucking uneducated.
[196:18.36]Should he have his own elementary school?
[196:26.68]Holy shit.
[196:28.85]Imagine in the summer.
[196:31.41]Imagine you're the person who occupies this room during the summer.
[196:38.67]Oh, wow.
[196:39.39]What a bright, beautiful, sunny day it is outside.
[196:41.99]I think I'll open up the window and get some air and cool off my room.
[196:53.78]Nevermind!
[196:58.24]Holy shit, that'd be so bad.
[197:02.26]But the one good thing is you could just... You wouldn't even need to pay for trash.
[197:06.92]You could just come out your door with bags of trash and just whip them over the side.
[197:14.82]Honey, we still need this TV.
[197:19.38]No, no, we don't need that TV anymore.
[197:21.59]It kinda doesn't work, does it?
[197:25.45]I'll get rid of it.
[197:27.95]Oh, be careful.
[197:28.73]No, I'll be okay.
[197:31.77]Hold on.
[197:32.13]Let me just... Oh, I got it.
[197:35.49]I got it, okay.
[197:39.67]Let me just go out the door.
[197:42.01]Ah, I'm out the front door now.
[197:43.39]Let me just get it.
[197:45.49]That was easy.
[197:54.51]We have any more stuff?
[198:00.91]Hey, son, open up your window!
[198:02.51]Let's check the trajectory.
[198:10.90]Check the trajectory.
[198:12.18]Yeah, if we get, son, if we take the sofa and we fucking go as fast as we can and throw it out your window, we'll get there, I think.
[198:20.95]Okay, let's try it.
[198:22.41]Alright, tilt yours this way.
[198:24.35]Tilt it, okay.
[198:26.45]Yeah, yeah, alright, now push, push.
[198:29.21]Alright, let it go, let it go, let it go.
[198:32.41]I got it, okay, let it go, good.
[198:35.05]Is it in there?
[198:39.15]Nah, good shot, son, good shot.
[198:49.52]You made it!
[198:49.92]I didn't think we were gonna have enough speed!
[198:57.46]Wait, no... It went into the street?
[199:02.61]They had the wrong window!
[199:06.59]No, no, that's not... That's...
[199:18.10]No, they threw it out here.
[199:19.62]Alright, well, fuck it, who cares?
[199:22.74]They'll be fine.
[199:25.70]But this... Oh, you know, I own my own dumpster.
[199:35.10]I make a lot of money, so I decided to make this Statue of Liberty back here.
[199:39.26]My own personal Statue of Liberty for me.
[199:41.36]I charge people money to come use it.
[199:46.09]I have to take out another loan to put the Statue of Liberty next to the guy's dump farm.
[199:53.67]No, no, no.
[199:55.25]No, I need work on this.
[199:57.17]How we doing?
[199:57.61]What do we need?
[199:58.05]We need more industry.
[200:00.62]More industry.
[200:01.90]How educated are people?
[200:02.96]We're good?
[200:04.32]People are smarter now.
[200:05.68]What's hap- what happened here?
[200:06.48]This house is dead.
[200:08.08]The house died.
[200:08.86]A dead person is waiting for transport.
[200:12.00]What?
[200:17.07]Nobody says dead in the house.
[200:21.35]These streets are too small.
[200:23.51]Look at these dump trucks.
[200:26.57]And these gas companies.
[200:30.67]There's like thousands of pounds of gravel going through here.
[200:37.31]Like oil and shit.
[200:38.83]This is not like a residential neighborhood.
[200:46.34]I need to have like a different bigger road to bring trash and stuff.
[200:54.47]Oh, I thought the clown was gonna come pick up the dead person.
[200:57.61]Alright, how do I... I need a cemetery?
[201:03.69]Oh, shit.
[201:06.00]Okay, how do I make a cemetery?
[201:10.36]Wait, I need police.
[201:12.76]What is this?
[201:13.68]Police headquarters.
[201:14.78]I don't know.
[201:20.09]Put it next to this dump.
[201:21.33]No, no.
[201:22.09]No, people are dead.
[201:23.23]Alright, I need, um... I need some, uh, hospital.
[201:27.43]Medical clinic.
[201:28.09]Alright, I don't have one over here.
[201:30.71]Okay, medical clinic over right here.
[201:32.65]In this new area that I've made.
[201:34.39]Right here, right here.
[201:34.99]This is perfect, right?
[201:36.33]Two medical cli- um... People are dead.

[201:44.35]And then one right here.
[201:47.19]Okay, and I need another doctor's office over here.
[201:49.23]Right at the corner.
[201:50.27]Okay, we're good.

[201:51.81]What?
[201:51.93]Why?
[201:52.01]What the hell is going on?
[201:53.24]Is there a family... Wait.
[202:12.81]Dude, this is a Daily Mail website.
[202:15.55]There's like 600 ads on Daily Mail.
[202:18.67]Hold on a second.
[202:20.99]There's like 40 ads on Daily Mail.
[202:24.34]Why did you link me a Daily Mail article?
[202:28.88]Oh my god, this is unbelievable.
[202:30.90]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7.
[202:36.92]There are seven, seven separate ads.
[202:40.74]Some of them are playing fucking music on this website.
[202:48.82]Holy shit, man.
[202:50.62]That's unbelievable.
[202:52.90]And if you have an ad blocker on, they yell at you.
[202:58.28]They get angry with you.
[202:59.28]If you have, excuse me, I thought you had an ad blocker off.
[203:01.86]Turn it off so we could deposit five fucking thousand ads into your face.
[203:08.35]Anyways, Misery the Fam is living in a cul-de-sac that's been stuck next to a stinking 18,000 ton waste mountain for three years.
[203:15.11]Holy shit, this is horrible.
[203:17.41]Oh my god, it's the same place!
[203:20.49]What the fuck?!
[203:28.62]Holy shit, this is terrible!
[203:30.58]This is actually awful!
[203:41.12]Okay.
[203:42.81]I have an ad on the side of this page for a toilet.
[203:50.19]But it's a small toilet.
[203:53.37]It's a toilet that shoots water up your ass.
[203:56.01]What?
[203:58.63]It's a little toilet that dad has... I don't understand.
[204:03.81]It's a bidet.
[204:04.51]Oh, alright.
[204:07.07]You guys have to help me out here.
[204:09.68]This is going to be a conversation.
[204:11.78]If you're eating, I would say probably stop for a little bit.
[204:14.92]Just don't eat for a minute.
[204:16.42]Just take your last bite.
[204:17.38]I'll wait.
[204:18.46]Swallow it.
[204:19.58]Okay, because this is going to be disgusting.
[204:22.60]Okay.
[204:23.56]Very important question.
[204:25.46]I've heard, hey, I can't believe, wow, a bidet changed everything.
[204:31.55]Oh, wow, it's so much better with a bidet.
[204:34.25]And I think about this sometimes.
[204:38.31]After you use the bathroom, wouldn't shooting water into your ass make gross water go all over your legs and your butt cheeks and stuff?
[204:51.66]I've told you this is going to be a fucking 18 plus conversation.
[204:57.99]I need to know.
[204:58.89]I'm curious.
[205:01.21]It just works.
[205:07.63]You're sitting down.
[205:08.25]But I feel like it would be like disgusting.
[205:17.44]It's not a hose, dude.
[205:18.60]Somebody said it's a drinking fountain.
[205:31.92]Can you imagine?
[205:35.04]Holy shit, that's fucking crazy.
[205:37.28]I don't know, I just don't know.
[205:49.29]I'm trying to be educated on this.
[206:01.02]You don't need, you don't need to use toilet paper.
[206:03.94]What?
[206:04.98]No fucking way!
[206:06.00]That's unheard of to me.
[206:08.43]That is unheard of to me.
[206:12.53]That's, no, that, I would never, I can't, no way.
[206:16.09]Nope, no, nope, nope, that doesn't work, that doesn't work, it doesn't work, that doesn't work, that doesn't work.
[206:21.93]No, it does not.
[206:22.83]No way.
[206:23.77]No fucking way.
[206:25.27]How do you dry your ass off?
[206:28.12]You just sit there and let water hit you all over the ass and you put your pants and underwear back on?
[206:31.66]How do you dry off your ass?
[206:33.24]What do you mean you don't use toilet paper anymore?
[206:37.89]You're putting water all over your back and your body!
[206:44.35]So you have water clean you and then you just pull your underwear back up?
[206:48.77]When you have like a big water stain on your ass?
[206:57.30]What if it misses?
[206:58.64]What if you're not sitting in the right way?
[207:00.16]What if you're, like, shimmying around or something?
[207:01.92]What if you, like, move in the right, wrong direction, just hit, boom, right on the side.
[207:05.75]And then, oh, shit, now what?
[207:08.35]What if you have to adjust?
[207:09.77]Am I gonna sit there and just, like, power wash the whole backside of my body until I get it in the right place?
[207:19.22]Do, is there, like, an app that you open up on, on your phone that you, like, aim the, the nozzle?
[207:26.44]How does this work?
[207:27.62]Calm down.
[207:28.28]I can't, I'm not gonna, I'm not gonna calm down on this one.
[207:48.67]Do it.
[207:48.97]You have to, you have to...
[207:52.51]It's a button you press.
[207:54.15]Yeah, I know, but what if you're in, like, the wrong spot?
[207:58.11]Is it possible that it'll hit you in, like, the back?
[208:01.79]What if it's not tweaked enough?
[208:03.19]What if it can, like, hit you right, like, in the swell of your back?
[208:07.45]Like, off your back?
[208:11.23]It hits you in the back of the head.
[208:21.12]You guys are fucking cracking me the fuck up right now.
[208:23.50]It's like when you're doing a handstand on the toilet.
[208:54.67]I need more industry.
[208:55.71]Hold on.
[208:56.09]Alright, I gotta go back to playing the game.

[213:26.81]What do you mean it's too steep for what?
[213:33.05]Who should I call if nobody comes to pick the dead up?

[217:01.59]Oh shit, they need water and electricity over here.
[217:04.90]Right.
[217:05.16]Okay.
[217:12.00]What about electric?
[217:13.20]Electric...
[217:15.00]Ooh, I can go from here.
[217:15.96]No, that's too far.
[217:16.60]Just go like this.
[217:17.02]That's gonna be really ugly if I do this, though, isn't it?
[217:19.82]Oh, that's super ugly.
[217:21.36]Way too ugly.
[217:22.86]That's too ugly.

[217:41.93]Good.
[217:43.01]Good.
[217:47.32]It's away from everybody.
[217:48.12]It's not over here.

[217:51.44]Just delete it.
[217:54.18]See?

[218:14.58]No.
[218:16.48]This way.
[218:21.03]Industry.
[218:22.43]A huge ass road.
[218:24.53]Highway with sound barrier.
[218:25.99]No.
[218:29.02]Wait, I can put an intersection.
[218:29.98]Ooh, look at this.
[218:30.70]This is cool. ...

[219:27.65]I don't know.
[219:29.31]I don't know.
[219:31.19]I don't know.
[219:31.85]I don't know about this stuff.
[219:34.71]I don't know.
[219:36.65]It's just... Oh, shit.
[219:38.01]Oh, shit.
[219:41.33]I just put a light on the highway.
[219:46.87]There's a light on the highway.
[219:49.95]As you're going 60, 70 miles per hour, and you have to stop at a red light here.
[219:55.36]Holy shit, that's so bad.
[219:58.34]The Statue of Liberty in the middle.
[220:11.45]Ow, my chest.
[220:14.11]This is just a drive-by.
[220:19.20]Okay, the Statue of Liberty is going right in the middle.
[220:21.28]You just drive around it.
[220:23.88]What a shitty attraction.
[220:26.60]You just drive around the Statue of Liberty in a circle and you get back on the highway.
[220:34.60]Coming up soon, the Statue of Liberty.
[220:37.39]Oh, honey, we're gonna go see that.
[220:39.91]And you get off and you just go around the roundabout.
[220:41.97]And you get back on the fucking highway and go back to what you were doing.
[220:47.19]And surrounded with stumps.
[220:53.84]What do you want me to click on?
[220:57.42]This is fucking funny to me.
[221:01.16]Oh, that's fucking, that's hilarious.
[221:03.20]God, I'm glad I clicked that.
[221:04.16]Alright, we need more educated people.
[221:13.53]This sucks so bad.
[221:15.59]I need, okay, how much is the Statue of Liberty?
[221:21.39]$210,000?
[221:21.43]Wait, I can just put it on the highway.
[221:34.18]Wait, I can put it on the highway.
[221:38.97]Like here.
[221:49.64]Holy shit, that's the stupidest thing.
[221:54.92]I can't.
[221:55.30]What is this?
[221:55.70]A winter market?
[222:00.00]Is this an Eiffel Tower?
[222:13.56]I can't put a landfill in the middle, guys.
[222:16.58]I can't.
[222:19.55]Fire, fire, fire, fire, fire, fire.
[222:22.27]Where's the fire department?
[222:24.13]Fire!
[222:27.63]Fire!
[222:29.11]Put it out.
[222:30.43]We're good.
[222:32.96]Alright, what was I doing?
[222:34.06]Right, something over here.
[222:34.94]I was deleting these two buildings.
[222:40.52]I was deleting these three buildings.
[222:44.97]Alright.
[222:45.43]Let's make... I need more... Industry.
[222:47.03]Industry.

[223:00.03]I need more than that.
[223:15.73]Come on, WTF?
[223:49.58]What the fuck is this?
[223:50.35]I don't know.
[223:50.83]I'm just trying to make it.
[224:01.44]Wait, they have to get all the... Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[224:07.98]Wait, you have to get back on the highway.
[224:09.76]Oh, shit.
[224:14.10]Okay, you have to get on the highway and go all the way around the whole fucking state.
[224:25.37]Oh, shit.
[224:25.93]Hold on.
[224:26.21]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[224:27.20]I can fix it.
[224:27.58]I can fix it.
[224:27.92]I can fix it.
[224:28.32]I can fix it.
[224:28.68]I can fix it.
[224:29.04]I can fix it.
[224:29.42]Pause the game.
[224:34.99]I'm right here.
[224:35.53]Okay, here we go.
[224:36.51]You can either get on the highway, or you can go check out our fucking industry.
[224:41.06]Sounds good to me.
[224:41.64]Good.
[224:42.18]Okay, we're fine.
[224:46.28]Okay, then you go this way, and you go over here.
[224:48.35]Go around the roundabout.
[224:51.83]I can't.
[224:54.05]I can't do it.
[224:56.09]The three...
[225:02.61]A little bit here, a little bit right there.
[225:09.69]No, this is so fucked.

[225:32.90]That's better.
[225:33.66]Okay, now that makes much more sense.
[225:35.92]Put a road in the roundabout.
[225:37.35]Wait, what do you mean put a road in the roundabout?
[226:11.55]This is so confusing, I don't even know how this would work.
[226:14.05]It's all in.
[226:14.53]If you go around the roundabout, you can go in here, and go in, and then left, and then... That's... I gotta delete this, it's too fucked up.
[226:41.22]of a roundabout is to not have to have something like this.
[226:59.07]No one's using it?
[226:59.83]Oh, they will.
[227:00.29]They'll have to.

[291:06.38]That's great.
[291:24.45]Okay.
[291:26.23]Cemetery.
[291:26.89]Right here.
[291:30.93]It's only those people over here, though.
[291:33.83]What the fuck?
[291:38.04]Oh!
[291:41.44]Finally, we can bury our dead!
[291:43.86]Hooray!
[291:54.01]I got 75k.
[291:56.69]Trash is building up.
[291:57.57]Alright, I need another dump.
[291:58.97]How's the dump looking?
[291:59.69]How many dumps do I got?
[292:03.96]Go to traffic.
[292:04.60]Alright, fine.
[292:09.66]What the hell is it?
[292:16.69]Ow, shit in my chest.
[292:32.63]This would be scary to drive down.
[292:38.51]Especially considering people can park on the street.
[292:41.50]People can park on the streets.
[292:45.02]I gotta fix this.
[292:48.92]Large roads.
[292:50.08]We need six lane roads here.
[292:52.28]Oh, it's gonna destroy this.
[293:03.91]This will only shift the bottleneck.
[293:06.35]Well, what would you have me do?
[293:08.14]Leave it like this?
[293:11.24]What's the alternative?
[293:14.34]Set it to upgrade.
[293:17.26]It destroys them.
[293:23.58]It's gonna take out the whole industry area.
[293:29.39]I have to do it!
[293:32.95]Okay.
[293:33.47]Wait, what?
[293:38.82]Oh my god, I have to!
[293:40.12]Look at this fucking mess.
[293:56.67]Alright, that should be okay.
[294:12.82]Alright.
[294:16.48]Incoming economic collapse.
[294:18.84]I'm fine right now.
[294:19.80]I know you don't.
[294:22.80]Look, we're going to switch.
[294:23.74]When we get into residential, we switch over.
[294:25.28]This is better.
[294:27.34]Alright, better.
[294:27.96]That should alleviate some of the tension.
[294:33.14]Just don't delete the university.
[294:34.58]Where is it?
[294:36.46]Over there.
[294:39.80]Okay, here we go.
[294:43.90]They will return.
[294:44.74]Businesses will come back.
[294:47.01]That's fine.
[294:55.61]Relax.
[295:24.85]These people are crossing the street.
[295:48.65]How do you need water?
[295:49.65]How?
[295:52.76]Water consumption?
[295:53.64]What are you talking about?
[295:55.54]You're fine.
[295:59.38]Can somebody go pick up this dead person?
[296:01.30]I need another cemetery.
[296:13.81]Fucking just put it... Just put it next door.
[296:17.59]Like, seriously.
[296:18.37]I need it here.
[296:21.62]Look at how much this will address the problem.
[296:23.34]Over here.
[296:36.03]Connect the road?
[296:43.94]I don't understand.
[296:45.57]You don't connect this road?
[296:47.91]What do you mean connect the road?
[296:49.33]No!
[297:02.34]Wait, I have to make this smaller for one second.
[297:06.34]Why can't I make this bigger?
[297:09.08]What do you mean this space is already occupied?
[297:15.46]Oh no!
[297:16.58]Oh shit!
[297:24.43]I don't understand traffic!
[297:26.51]I don't understand!
[297:27.53]Okay.
[297:28.41]Make this larger.
[297:30.25]I can't make- Why can I not make this one bigger?
[297:32.21]I can't even make it a double!
[297:36.81]I can't even make it a double!
[297:46.18]I can't even get in!
[297:47.96]The ambulance is Austin-powered!
[297:56.67]Where's the fire?
[297:57.63]We need to make room for the emergency vehicles!
[298:06.19]He's sitting in traffic.
[298:09.64]What the fuck?
[298:11.32]There's one, two, three, four ambulances.
[298:14.78]They're going crazy.
[298:16.40]Where's the hospital?
[298:19.68]What is it?
[298:20.10]Where are they trying to go?
[298:23.28]Where are they?
[298:25.88]Oh.
[298:27.10]Where are they going?
[298:29.52]I need to relax.
[298:30.84]Relax.
[298:31.82]Okay, the road's bigger now.
[298:33.14]You can fucking move.
[298:50.54]Ow!
[298:52.50]Just make the whole thing with six lanes of air and I don't know what the fuck I'm doing!
[298:56.44]Okay, there!
[298:59.16]You can survive!
[299:06.88]They're making some face!
[299:17.17]This doesn't even work, man!
[299:25.30]Why are there so many ambulances?
[299:30.42]But I don't know.
[299:31.04]Okay.
[299:31.30]I don't understand why there's so many ambulances driving by.
[299:36.32]There's nothing even happening.
[299:37.46]Everybody's fine.
[299:38.68]It's because of car accidents.
[299:47.90]It's because of car accidents.
[299:51.96]Why are they not using both lanes?
[299:54.92]Why are they not using... Why are they only using... Is it because this one asshole is parked in the street?
[300:04.95]That guy was parked!
[300:06.46]That guy was parked in the middle of the street and you see that bullshit?
[300:10.18]Why the fuck did you do that?
[300:22.01]Oh my god.
[300:23.03]I don't know anything about fucking city design.
[300:26.66]I don't know anything.
[300:27.80]I don't know anything about this shit.
[300:30.84]Tell me where somebody's fucking seeing this that does this shit for a living and they're like, holy shit, how did this guy get out of fourth grade?
[300:37.76]I don't know.
[300:38.25]Very, very carefully, apparently.
[300:41.51]Ugh.
[300:45.57]Okay.
[300:46.75]So.
[300:48.91]What's happening here?
[300:52.50]Why are they only using one lane?
[300:54.34]Why are they all in one lane?
[300:58.44]I don't understand.
[301:00.20]Are you all taking a right-hand turn?
[301:03.01]They're all taking a right.
[301:13.47]Oh my God, it's chaos.
[301:17.95]Okay.
[301:20.22]Just make the roads bigger.
[301:22.62]There, see?
[301:23.40]Um, I don't know.
[301:27.19]Just do it.
[301:29.43]Just do it to every road that I can do it to.
[301:33.59]All roads need to be septuple-laned.
[301:38.92]There.
[301:41.50]Okay.
[301:41.98]Ugh, my fucking throat hurts.
[301:54.00]Jesus Christ Where's the fire department?
[302:22.56]Where's the fire department?
[302:24.94]Fire department.
[302:25.78]We need one right now.
[302:27.20]We need a fire station.
[302:30.12]Fire station, please.

[302:51.94]Why are you going this way?
[302:53.88]Holy shit.
[302:58.06]Every fire department.
[303:02.09]Every single fucking county.
[303:06.09]Oh, my God.
[303:13.35]Why are you turning around?
[303:15.22]Stop here and put this out.
[303:17.34]Put it out.
[303:20.04]Where are the rest of them?
[303:23.72]Holy shit.
[303:24.72]Okay, we're fine.
[303:27.58]We're fine.
[303:37.87]Can we please just stop this and just clean this up?
[303:51.78]Where are they going?
[303:53.37]There's not another fire over here, right?
[303:56.77]There are no fires down here, are there?
[303:58.25]Oh my god!
[304:11.03]Wait!
[304:11.87]Why are there fires everywhere?
[304:14.11]I don't understand.
[304:15.83]What happened?
[304:17.90]What the fuck is going on?
[304:19.08]Did I get hit by a meteor?
[304:21.76]I don't know why this is happening.
[304:23.74]Is there fire?
[304:34.63]This is still spreading.
[304:38.21]Guys, get... I need more fire, man.
[304:41.79]I need more fire.
[304:42.45]Oh, boy.

[305:14.01]Fire engines in use.
[305:15.05]Zero.
[305:16.05]Zero out of 23.
[305:17.03]Zero, huh?
[305:18.17]Zero?
[305:19.83]Get out there!
[305:20.45]Where are all the garbage trucks?
[305:26.01]I don't know.
[305:26.41]We're having like a total city-wide...
[305:31.76]The burning of our whole town for some fucking reason?
[305:37.89]What happened here?
[305:40.85]Jesus!
[305:44.67]Okay.
[305:46.22]I think we're... Are we done?
[305:47.98]Are we good?
[305:49.68]Oh!
[305:58.34]Jesus, man.
[305:59.93]I have to...
[306:05.07]Did you see the blimp?
[306:06.95]Oh, my fucking head hurts.
[306:11.77]That was fucking outrageous.
[306:12.93]The traffic, they couldn't even get through the traffic.
[306:14.86]No, this is on fire.
[306:22.12]Guys, just... How do I... I can't delete this with my hand?
[306:26.18]I have 30... I only have $30,000.
[306:28.26]What happened?
[306:36.55]This is going to spread over here.
[306:42.30]Okay.
[306:43.36]Well, that was interesting.
[306:45.60]Oh, hold on.
[307:00.78]Oh, I'm like choking.
[307:05.93]Alright.
[307:08.15]I need to clean this up and do what I was doing before.
[307:11.13]Whatever that was, I don't even remember.
[307:13.05]I was going to build a monorail over here.
[307:17.44]Right.
[307:18.88]Yeah.
[307:19.62]That's what I was doing.
[307:21.84]Okay.
[307:22.44]Monorail time.
[307:32.93]Wait.
[307:38.37]Bus.
[307:38.59]Where's the monorail?
[307:43.19]Metro.
[307:44.75]Train.
[307:46.15]Ship.
[307:47.51]Plane.
[307:49.25]Monorail.
[307:51.16]Monorail station.
[307:53.18]Monorail station with road.
[307:56.34]Ooh.
[308:01.76]Monorail bus hub.
[308:03.99]A monorail station with a built-in bus stop so passengers can easily switch between the two transports.
[308:08.15]Alright, here we go.
[308:13.80]Wait.
[308:15.82]It has to be on a building?
[308:23.52]Wait, it has to be on a road?
[309:10.32]Let's keep going.
[309:19.28]You have no money?
[309:21.06]I'll just raise taxes for five minutes.
[309:24.06]Okay, I need to continue my monorail.
[309:31.10]First I need... Where was the monorail?
[309:32.76]Where the hell was that?
[309:37.28]I don't even know what that was.
[309:38.06]Oh, here.
[309:39.43]Okay, monorail.
[310:11.37]Where am I going?
[310:14.65]Uh, I don't know.
[310:16.03]I wanted to just have a monorail go around the whole town and have little stops along the way.
[310:21.33]Can I do that?
[310:27.57]Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.

[310:45.08]How do you make him get out?
[310:48.60]Monorail line.
[310:50.50]Click on monorail stops connected with tracks to each other.
[310:53.74]Wait, monorail stops?
[311:03.50]How do I make it so people can get out?
[311:10.25]No, I'm not ready to do this yet.
[311:11.26]Do I have to build a road?
[311:13.08]Would I actually need a fucking road?
[311:46.09]See, when you go down, you get to go like, whoa!
[311:48.48]And it's like a landmark.
[311:50.66]Stop.

[315:45.92]I have way more production.
[315:47.26]Why are they disconnected?
[315:56.57]I've got plenty of electricity available.
[316:03.90]What's going on?
[316:09.75]Poop is clogging the wires.
[316:12.51]What am I missing here?
[316:14.29]Why would that be disconnected if I have plenty of electricity to use?
[316:18.07]Oh, was this a bad connection?

[321:00.13]Because they're sick.
[321:04.77]I have like five of these things.
[321:10.15]Isolated.
[321:10.69]Oh, they're not sick anymore.
[321:14.65]Oh.
[321:27.34]Why are these all abandoned?
[321:32.23]Why are these all abandoned?
[321:35.51]Excuse me, what's going on here?
[321:38.67]Oh, there weren't enough people to work the job.
[321:40.34]Oh.
[321:42.44]Oh, this whole street's gonna get abandoned.
[321:44.60]Uh, alright.
[321:45.96]Well, now there's plenty more options.
[321:47.72]Okay.
[321:50.26]Connect this road here so we can use the monorail.
[321:52.03]Here we go.
[321:58.41]Nice!
[322:02.37]Yeah, I'll fix it.
[322:03.07]Don't worry.
[322:07.80]I did tell you that was temporary.
[322:09.04]I did say that.
[322:11.61]Yes, I did.
[322:12.87]You did not.
[322:13.29]Yes, I did.
[322:14.87]Stop.
[322:15.15]Heck.
[322:32.34]Alright, so who's gonna use it?
[322:33.40]Can I adjust the speed?
[322:37.66]These hou- These are all houses.
[322:39.08]Holy shit, there's a lot of people over here.
[322:40.30]Alright, I need a, uh... Elementary school.
[322:42.56]I don't have any money.
[322:59.65]Okay, good.
[323:01.97]And then a high school.
[323:04.33]And then a... You know, let's put a library over here.
[323:07.19]A better library.
[323:08.91]You know, we only have one in the whole town.
[323:10.60]Look, there'll be a library right here for all the people to come and hang out.
[323:14.38]Good.
[323:15.06]Alright, now let's increase the fuck out of taxes and make it... Wait, is somebody gonna get on the monorail?
[323:29.03]Uh, this road doesn't go anywhere.
[323:31.77]I need more people.
[323:32.51]I need more jobs.
[323:33.13]Alright, let's do some more residential.
[323:40.03]It's already there.
[323:40.55]Good.
[323:40.71]I don't think anyone's going to get on this.
[323:52.86]Go on first person with the monorail.
[323:54.96]How do I do that?
[324:12.68]Whoa, cool.
[324:20.93]You can click on the train now.
[324:23.53]Wait!
[324:24.07]Somebody's using this road!
[324:26.03]It's an ambulance.
[324:28.75]Where are you off to?
[324:34.98]Where are you going?
[324:37.04]There's no hospitals down here.
[324:47.36]Good maneuvering.
[324:49.18]You went over the fun hump.
[324:54.64]Oh, hold on.
[324:59.13]Oh, somebody's sick in here.
[325:02.01]Okay, let's go.
[325:02.79]Get him.
[325:03.65]Get him into the back of the ambulance.
[325:06.81]Take him to the hospital.
[325:09.40]Quickly.
[325:23.43]Is he stopping at a red light?
[325:29.25]The siren's not even on.
[326:20.90]What?
[326:21.98]Where is he?
[326:32.29]Wait, what?
[326:32.97]What's this monorail doing over here?
[326:35.41]Oh, right.
[326:36.05]I forgot.
[326:55.82]This is too far to go.
[326:57.44]I need to make some medical centers down there.
[327:11.66]It's been like 12 days.
[327:15.68]It's a road trip.
[327:18.33]How come nobody's using the monorail?
[327:27.31]I want to see somebody in it.
[327:37.20]This, you guys, is a cross-country emergency.
[327:41.04]Yep.
[327:46.14]At least there's no traffic here.
[327:47.88]Oh, wait!
[327:48.38]Somebody gonna get on the motorboat?
[327:49.90]Oh, fuck this.
[327:50.70]I don't care about that anymore.
[328:23.14]Yeah, drive the guy through the smog with the windows down.
[328:26.06]Why are you going on this road?
[328:36.88]Holy shit.
[328:43.47]You're gonna let this guy... What the fuck?
[328:50.11]He's right there.
[328:52.22]Why is it so loud?
[328:53.40]This window keeps moving.
[329:12.69]Dude, I can't follow it.
[329:13.89]The window keeps fucking moving.
[329:21.05]I never thought about how much garbage piles up in two weeks.
[329:30.20]Where's the nearest hospital?
[329:40.71]Hey!
[329:54.52]Oh!
[329:54.98]Okay, we made it.
[329:58.90]Did he make it?
[329:59.40]I think he made it.
[330:04.98]I need more trash pickup.
[330:12.39]Okay, what happened down here?
[330:13.85]What the fuck?
[330:17.32]I'm getting so turned around, this city is so fucked up.
[330:23.12]Which way is the right way?
[330:23.98]Okay, this way, right?
[330:25.97]Okay.
[330:28.97]Oh, man.
[330:29.59]Oh, it hurts to look at.
[330:34.57]Okay.
[330:36.11]Alright.
[330:37.13]So, fuck.
[330:38.89]Let's, um... Oh, the fire over here.
[330:41.69]I'll...
[330:43.93]We're good, we're good, we're good, we're good.
[330:45.51]This doesn't need to exist.
[330:46.79]People are just going down here.
[330:48.57]Ah!
[330:51.15]Okay.
[330:55.52]Ah, what do I do?
[330:56.46]What do I need?
[330:57.04]I need industry, but I need workers.
[331:00.54]I need trash pickup.
[331:10.70]Fix the train?
[331:12.38]What's wrong with the train?
[331:13.68]There's nothing wrong with it.
[331:17.34]How do I turn it on?
[331:26.70]It needs a route?
[331:28.23]This is not a route?
[331:30.59]It needs a route.
[331:31.41]How is this not a route?
[331:38.36]I have to set up a route.
[331:44.76]Oh, okay.
[331:45.96]Routes.
[331:46.26]How do I make one?
[331:49.04]How do you make a route?
[331:52.46]Traffic routes.
[331:54.08]Adjust roads.
[331:55.02]Routes.
[331:57.08]It has to loop?
[332:00.26]The monorail tab.
[332:01.48]Post service.
[332:06.82]Tours.
[332:08.65]Taxi monorail.
[332:15.24]Routes.
[332:16.16]Where are the routes?
[332:33.97]Wait.
[332:35.37]Hold on.
[332:35.88]You're talking about...
[332:39.48]It has to do this, is what you're saying?
[332:47.31]No.
[332:48.23]So why won't it work?
[332:54.80]Top left traffic menu.
[333:05.18]Have I never been to a city?
[333:06.12]Yeah, but I mean, like, how do I get it to... Where's the... Add stops to both stations.
[333:21.61]Metro train hub?
[333:24.81]Monorail station with road?
[333:26.87]Monorail station needs to be connected to other stations of the monorail track.
[333:30.08]Traffic highway.
[333:33.19]The third icon.
[333:35.07]Miscellaneous.
[333:37.10]Click on the monorail stops connected with... Create a new line.
[333:47.40]There.
[333:47.62]Done.
[333:53.29]Complete the line.
[334:01.69]Ah, this is a huge PogChamp moment right here.
[334:03.74]Alright, there it goes!
[334:06.38]This thing's fucking fast!
[334:15.75]This thing goes faster than the cars!
[334:18.83]Okay, I've never seen a monorail before that goes more than 60.
[334:31.40]Whoa.
[334:33.58]Oh, cool.
[334:35.28]Now what do people do when they get off?
[335:01.80]Responding to a call at the broad residence.
[335:05.98]I'm in a big city.
[335:11.47]Okay, responding to a call at the pleasant residence.
[335:17.23]I'm a big city.
[335:19.63]Nice.
[335:20.87]This is pretty cool.
[335:21.85]I'm a big city now.
[335:26.48]How much money?
[335:27.98]I got $211,000.
[335:28.54]Fucking $211,000.
[335:29.42]I need more electricity.
[335:37.29]Need more wind farms.
[335:38.65]Water, wind farms.
[335:41.15]What's this thing?
[335:41.55]Hydro pump.
[335:43.53]Blowing water is an infinite source of kinetic power.
[335:46.02]Find a strong current in a river.
[335:49.58]Wait what?
[335:51.04]This is not strong.
[335:57.30]What's this?
[335:58.44]Water treatment plant.
[336:04.79]Get this shit on here.
[336:09.69]Water treatment plant.
[336:11.89]Done.
[336:48.48]I'm not gonna take out a fucking loan.
[336:50.60]Wait, I didn't connect it.
[336:51.40]Hold on.
[336:56.70]Done.
[336:57.86]Bingo!
[337:06.17]I need more power.
[337:07.25]Shit.
[337:07.65]Right, I need more of these.
[337:22.80]Okay, we're going to see those disappear in a minute here.
[337:31.89]That is 281 production.
[337:36.08]Okay, let's raise taxes like crazy for a minute and then build a nice Statue of Liberty roundabout.
[337:42.54]What's the biggest roundabout I can make?
[338:10.63]I need a little road in here.
[338:12.07]Small enough to put it on.
[338:12.95]Like right... Like right there.
[338:22.39]Can I do it right there?
[338:26.85]Okay.
[338:35.93]Fuck.
[338:37.77]I can't put it right there?
[338:50.92]Oh, yes I can.
[338:53.96]Don't tell me what I can and can't fucking do again.
[339:04.86]Where's one way?
[339:11.48]Where's one way?
[339:13.28]Four lane.
[339:21.20]It's the Riddler.
[339:22.25]Yeah, because it's all just going around.
[339:27.19]Where's one way?
[339:35.76]Two lane, one way road.
[339:37.28]There we go.
[340:08.06]Like a lull of road.
[340:12.34]Alright, it's time to raise taxes for like fucking two minutes.
[340:27.62]Give me money now.
[340:28.38]Go, go, go, go.
[340:29.39]Deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit, deposit.
[340:39.76]One.
[340:40.76]Two.
[340:41.80]Three.
[340:42.88]Four.
[340:43.62]Done.
[340:52.90]Okay.
[341:01.75]Okay, I can fix it.
[341:02.67]I need a bigger rope.
[341:03.27]I need a little bit bigger.
[341:08.77]Wait, it's a highway.
[341:16.13]Highway.
[341:17.61]Highway.
[341:18.02]Highway was... Wait.
[341:52.33]Come on!
[341:52.97]I can't put it on a highway!
[341:54.19]Here we go.
[342:08.28]One way.
[342:11.11]Six lane, one way road.
[342:31.56]Come on!
[342:59.43]I don't want six lane.
[343:02.47]Fine.
[343:04.56]Build the statue first.
[343:05.58]I can't.
[343:05.88]It's going to be on a road.
[343:33.51]Why?
[344:19.83]Wait, why would you come through here when you can already drive by it for free?
[344:24.58]I was gonna make tolls here.
[344:25.94]How do you make a toll road?
[344:32.24]Pause it, pause it, pause it.
[344:35.00]I'm so fucking stupid.
[344:56.08]Right-click and switch the type.
[344:57.38]Okay, so... Right-click?
[345:06.93]Road tolls, here we go.
[345:07.79]Okay, one lar- one-way large toll booth.
[345:51.60]Can I move this?
[345:56.18]Okay, you have to go, here we go, over here.
[345:59.21]Over here, here we go.
[346:01.79]Why is it this way?
[346:03.43]Oh, no, no, no, that's fine, that's fine.
[346:07.83]So you come in, and you go... But how do you get out?
[346:17.99]Do another one, do another one.
[346:19.47]Do like three...
[346:24.46]How do I spin it around?
[346:25.64]It seems to go through three doors.
[346:30.51]Wait, what?
[346:31.65]I'm so confused.
[346:32.59]Which way are the cars driving?
[346:36.81]Okay, this way.
[346:48.78]Okay, so you have to go...
[346:58.61]Okay, explain this to me, because I'm fucking stupid apparently!
[347:01.49]Wha- I don't understand!
[347:10.06]Which- well, there's arrows pointing this way, and arrows pointing this way.
[347:19.62]Which way do the cars have to go?
[347:21.80]It goes both ways?
[347:37.60]Look at the ends.
[347:43.57]So it goes this way.
[347:45.67]Okay, good.
[347:46.87]So it goes this way.
[347:49.19]Good.
[347:49.45]This is the exit.
[347:52.43]So it goes this way.
[347:56.16]So I have to, um...
[348:10.40]I don't have any money.
[348:11.12]How the fuck do I not have any money?
[348:28.53]What?
[348:35.31]Wait.
[348:58.46]Move, move this fucking thing.
[348:59.60]Move it.
[348:59.94]Just move, move, move, move, move, move, move.
[349:01.86]Pause again.
[349:02.79]Relocate this.
[349:03.95]Get rid of this.
[349:08.77]Can I tilt this?
[349:13.46]How do I rearrange this?
[349:14.34]How do I rotate?
[349:15.56]How do I rotate?
[349:17.05]I can't rotate.
[349:20.15]Which button is it?
[349:20.71]Okay, good.
[349:29.60]Right here.
[349:39.80]Alright, good.
[349:45.54]Thank you.
[350:14.60]I have fucking money, how?
[350:29.11]Alright.
[350:35.15]Good to go.
[350:48.45]Okay, wait, wait, wait.
[350:49.03]It needs to be connected.
[350:50.52]I need power.
[350:51.32]Pause it.
[350:51.70]Okay, power and water.
[351:11.91]Done.
[351:12.13]Statue of Liberty needs power...
[351:17.42]Wait, how much electricity does this use?
[351:21.96]Plenty.
[351:23.82]Alright, what's going- what's wrong with this?
[351:25.50]Multiple problems.
[351:29.59]No road access.
[351:30.51]Make sure cars and pedestrians can reach the entrance.
[351:40.86]No water's going through here?
[351:41.88]Oh, this has to be connected.
[351:45.54]Alright, come on in to see the Statue of Liberty!
[351:47.90]The statue's not on a road?
[352:20.49]Wha- what does that matter?
[352:51.00]Uh, how do I do that?
[352:52.28]Can I, can I pick it up?
[352:58.20]Wait, what?
[353:03.29]Wait, this was, how did I put it down the first time?
[353:18.34]Why the fuck is this city on fire?
[353:24.27]Ah!
[353:25.05]City's burning.
[353:26.85]Wait, what?
[353:27.47]I don't... It's because this shit's a highway?
[353:47.32]Fuck.
[353:51.50]I'll fix it.
[354:13.03]You motherfucker!
[354:19.19]Oh, just do it already!
[354:29.32]Got it!
[354:29.78]You piece of shit, I swear to God.
[355:11.82]Connect the road to it.
[355:15.98]I can't.
[355:16.43]I can't.
[355:21.63]It's like... Alright.
[355:23.97]There we go.
[355:24.73]There we go.
[355:25.07]There we go.
[355:25.35]There we go.
[355:29.49]Done.
[355:39.97]Now upgrade the road.
[355:44.79]No, I can't.
[355:46.71]My taxes.
[355:56.16]Make entrance cheap.
[355:59.74]Entrance, 10 cents.
[356:02.54]Exit is fucking $4.
[356:13.05]I need to... trash trash trash trash trash.
[356:21.05]Firefighter, firefighter, firefighter, firefighter. Trash trash trash trash. Dump dump dump dump dump.
[356:30.05]What do you need to dump?
[356:33.05]Where am I?
[356:38.05]Okay - there's a dump right here!
[356:41.05]No, that's a cemetery.
[356:51.84]Okay, we're good.
[357:00.39]Why does nobody want to see the beautiful Statue of Liberty?
[357:04.23]It's free to get in.
[357:17.40]It's not connected?
[357:20.16]Oh!
[357:24.51]Oh yeah!
[357:25.21]First sucker of the evening.
[357:45.79]Wait, are they getting on?
[358:04.31]Two lanes.
[358:08.57]Only one person.
[358:10.33]It's the one fucking brainless idiot that doesn't understand that you can just drive by it.
[358:18.66]Oh, no, we got another group.
[358:22.54]I want to see them leave.
[358:23.62]How much is this?
[358:24.12]Yeah, it's two dollars to leave.
[358:26.30]Here they come.
[358:28.14]Word of mouth.
[358:37.93]Yeah, it comes through the Statue of Liberty.
[358:39.66]Well, the trash piles up and the city burns.
[358:49.62]Okay, I wanna watch somebody leave.
[358:54.45]Dogs allowed here?
[359:01.79]Delete the highway.
[359:03.71]What do you mean delete the highway?
[359:04.65]Delete the highway, delete the highway, delete the highway, delete the highway.
[359:06.83]Delete the highway.
[359:07.43]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[359:08.61]What's going on?
[359:09.75]Make a statue district.
[359:10.95]Delete the highway.
[359:11.71]They must go in.
[359:12.65]Delete the highway.
[359:47.06]This is so fucking stupid.
[359:49.32]They just don't want to go.
[359:51.15]They just want to leave.
[359:52.09]How much is the leave?
[359:53.51]That's free money.
[359:55.37]That's free money.
[359:57.39]And maybe some of you will stick around to go see the Statue of Liberty.
[360:04.03]Three people did.
[360:04.79]Raise the toll.
[360:11.34]They have no choice.
[360:12.24]It's already as high as it can go.
[360:19.22]put another toll after the toll can I do that?
[360:23.52]is that illegal?
[360:34.07]just do tolls for five miles?
[360:36.17]okay yeah sure
[360:48.63]How dare you go see the fucking Statue of Liberty?
[360:50.43]Does that work?
[361:19.84]No, I don't- I don't have great- Oh, I don't have any more money.
[361:39.13]This city's fucked.
[361:42.89]I need, uh, how much money?
[361:44.81]How much fucking money does this cost? $12,000?! !
[361:50.56]This shit's 35 grand?
[361:52.59]Um, what?
[361:53.37]Alright, hold on.
[362:00.85]I need to make some money first.
[362:09.20]Wait, they're avoiding the toll.
[362:11.08]They're driving off the road.
[362:15.09]Two bucks.
[362:18.38]Thank you for an amazing vacation.
[362:19.82]See you next year.
[362:20.50]Wait, I'm not even getting fucking money for this.
[362:23.66]I need... I'm not even getting any money for this one.
[362:33.36]Why not just delete this?
[362:36.80]I think these people are stuck here.
[362:37.97]Raise the price of the entrance.
[362:54.42]diabolical.
[362:57.78]Make tolls going into the city.
[362:59.60]Alright, speaking of the city, it's in shambles.
[363:07.61]These are all abandoned buildings.
[363:14.24]Why do I hear a fire sound?
[363:22.50]Alright, neither of that.
[363:23.62]Let's... Okay, let's increase some fucking... Let's go to the budget.
[363:26.22]Where's the trash?
[363:29.36]More money to the trash.
[363:30.94]More.
[363:31.18]As much as possible.
[363:40.63]Taxes.
[363:42.51]Eh.
[363:44.01]Loans.
[363:44.69]Eh.
[363:46.67]Okay.
[363:47.13]I need another toll.
[363:50.59]Right about here.
[363:51.23]Let's pause it.
[363:59.76]One-way toll booth.
[364:01.18]This one's cheaper.
[364:03.83]Wait, hold on.
[364:07.86]Everyone's fucked now.
[364:48.82]I'm gonna take them all around this whole thing and then connect them.
[364:52.22]They have to pay it.
[364:53.18]Imagine avoiding this.
[364:57.68]Oh yeah, I'm getting directions to my grandmother's house.
[365:01.18]Would you like to avoid the toll road?
[365:03.84]Oh no!
[365:05.12]Fuck it, I don't care.
[365:05.86]I guess I'll pay it.
[365:07.66]Are you sure?
[365:08.18]Yeah, whatever.
[365:32.74]I'm gonna make so much money, you have no idea.
[365:36.28]I'm gonna make hundreds of thousands of dollars.
[365:38.78]And my city will be so cool.
[365:41.75]This is gonna go fucking this way, around here, this way, down, then back down.
[365:50.45]Make it go into the city?
[365:52.85]Make it go, like, through fucking residential areas?
[365:55.49]Okay, hold on.
[365:58.65]Yeah, that's funny.
[365:59.69]That's funny.
[366:00.05]I wanna do that.
[366:01.90]You get a whole tour of the whole city.
[366:09.77]Fuck, I'm out of money.
[366:10.37]Why are they disappearing?
[366:22.81]Hey.
[366:24.06]Hey!
[366:36.55]What's going on?
[366:37.77]Yeah, it is.
[366:38.37]It's connected.
[366:41.73]It's connected.
[366:57.94]Hey!
[367:00.51]They despawn if there's no way to the destination.
[367:03.25]Ah, okay, I see.
[367:05.00]Well, they'll get there eventually.
[367:06.10]Can I take out, like, a monster lung?
[367:15.29]Give this to me.
[367:23.39]What's the cheapest route I can possibly make?
[367:27.72]Two-lane gravel road?
[367:28.92]Can I do one-way gravel road?
[367:30.40]How much is this?
[367:30.84]$20?
[367:31.48]Okay, good.
[367:39.09]One-way toll booth.
[367:41.43]Okay, stone.
[367:41.99]Stone.
[367:57.64]There's that gravel road.
[367:58.87]There it is.
[368:06.03]Imagine driving by this Statue of Liberty and you see people needing to do this.
[368:10.41]This is great.
[368:24.14]Okay, I need money.
[368:26.54]Money!
[368:28.60]Money.
[368:33.23]Taxes.
[368:38.35]Money, money, money, money, money, money, money, money.
[368:40.68]Taxes.
[368:41.16]Increase.
[368:43.24]Something stupid and then just immediately take it off.
[368:49.55]Nope.
[369:13.01]Cool.
[369:14.49]See?
[369:15.27]I'm... I'm good.
[369:16.85]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[369:18.39]Wait.
[369:18.95]What if I just connect this?
[369:20.02]No, they'll be stuck forever.
[369:21.42]Hold on a second.
[369:25.14]If I just connect this here, they'll just have to go in this loop literally forever.
[369:32.56]But the issue there is, when there's too much traffic, it'll get stuck.
[369:41.18]The plan is to go around here.
[369:43.02]The plan is to go here.
[369:45.44]And then around here, back connecting to the highway.
[369:49.52]Okay, I've got $67,000.
[369:55.44]You know what I'm saying?
[369:59.24]Just like go all the way over here.
[370:00.46]I can fix this later.
[370:12.73]Make the toll go through here.
[370:25.56]Oh, shit.
[370:26.98]Hold on, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[370:29.97]Make a ramp.
[370:32.23]What is it, page up?
[370:34.25]Okay, now we're gonna, yeah, make just a single road.
[370:36.55]We have to go ramp up.
[370:57.57]Okay.
[370:59.45]Ramp it down.
[371:00.01]Oh, wait.
[371:03.85]I'm having to go underground and back up again.
[371:07.93]No, that's too much.
[371:09.35]That's too much.
[371:19.05]Okay, now back to normal.
[371:22.65]We'll get a toll at the end of that, but I want to make sure this is connecting.
[371:25.07]Okay.
[371:27.27]Wait, hold on.
[371:28.39]I gotta level this out.
[371:38.23]Okay.
[371:40.85]A taller coaster.
[371:41.99]Okay.
[371:53.15]Page up.
[371:59.92]I need to- What the fuck?
[372:03.80]Where is this- Wait, wait, hold on.
[372:06.70]I need to- I have to- Holy shit, this is gonna take fucking forever.
[372:20.11]Alright, that's fine, that's fine, that's fine.
[372:26.03]Back to normal.
[372:27.31]Alright, again.
[372:38.72]So we need one here.
[372:40.54]Let me delete this.
[372:41.76]Just delete enough space where I can put it in.
[372:45.53]It's two spaces, right?
[372:53.53]Okay.
[373:02.05]Okay, delete.
[373:03.83]I should put houses here too.
[373:08.54]Okay, then delete this.
[373:12.72]Fuck, I wish you could just do one.
[373:20.89]Do two.
[373:25.39]Okay, delete two.
[373:39.09]How much money do I have?
[373:39.77]Not enough.
[373:45.16]Hopefully this will fix the traffic in the city.
[373:48.92]How long is that fucking money?
[373:50.50]I have to finish the road.
[373:53.48]I have to for now.
[373:54.22]I'll fix it later.
[373:56.67]Why am I getting- I'm $55,000 a week!
[374:02.31]Are the taxes still high?
[374:06.05]No, they're not.
[374:08.94]Alright, I gotta connect the exit.
[374:10.12]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[374:16.98]Just connect it.
[374:19.66]I'll fix the rest later.
[374:23.24]Done.
[374:23.66]Okay.
[374:25.14]Action.
[374:26.94]I'll fix it later.
[374:31.35]I need, okay, I need, uh, power.
[374:37.45]Power and water?
[374:39.15]Oy.
[374:41.75]Oy.
[374:43.67]Well, at least it'll be here already.
[374:44.67]I don't have enough money to do this.
[374:55.50]Fuck.
[375:01.71]Fuck.
[375:02.53]Fuck.
[375:03.35]Fuck.
[375:07.02]Fuck!
[375:08.96]No, I need one of these to be over here.
[375:11.62]What is this mess right here?
[375:21.34]What the hell is this?
[375:36.76]Come on!
[375:39.30]Come on!
[375:42.72]Negative $217.
[375:44.24]Oh!
[375:48.20]What's going on?
[375:48.86]What's going on?
[375:57.49]Oh, this shit's not connected to anything.
[375:58.89]Right, that's why it was there.
[375:59.89]Okay, just put it from here to here.
[376:02.01]I have negative fucking money.
[376:06.18]Shit.
[376:07.12]Oh, fuck.
[376:07.76]Taxes.
[376:08.16]Uh-oh.
[376:09.46]Uh-oh.
[376:11.38]Alright, that's enough.
[376:48.85]Okay, power, power, power.
[376:49.99]We need power from... We need power here.
[376:54.31]That'll do it.
[376:57.11]That'll do it.
[376:58.33]I know that's fucking stupid, I know, but just trust me on this.
[377:01.25]Okay.
[377:12.60]We're good.
[377:13.86]Wait, tolls.
[377:22.59]As much as I can do.
[377:26.19]This is two bucks per car, by the way.
[377:28.97]Hey, dude!
[377:30.43]I'll just make taxes in the city zero.
[377:42.18]Make the city taxes absolute zero.
[377:45.94]Yeah, that sounds good.
[377:48.68]Okay, there we go.
[377:50.88]Enjoy the Statue of Liberty.
[377:54.35]Is this working now?
[377:55.97]Is this connected?
[377:56.90]Wait, hold on.
[377:59.40]Is this not connected?
[378:04.00]Is it connecting people?
[378:06.22]Should be.
[378:06.80]Alright.
[378:07.34]Looks good.
[378:09.04]Very good.
[378:09.80]Plus $57,000 coming in.
[378:11.14]We're good.
[378:14.21]Everything's alright.
[378:14.83]Let's take a look at how this looks.
[378:18.81]Good.
[378:18.97]Good.
[378:34.67]I'm gonna let this play out for a little bit.
[378:36.09]I need to fix some stuff in the city.
[378:39.05]There's so much trash.
[378:42.51]Oh fuck!
[378:42.89]Who cares?
[378:43.27]Fuck these people!
[378:43.77]Put a dump right here!
[378:47.24]What?
[378:47.46]They're gonna get mad that they're driving by dumps?
[378:50.00]I'll put like five of them.
[378:54.70]What do I care?
[378:59.47]Floating garbage collector?
[379:04.00]Oh, an incinerator.
[379:04.76]Here we go.
[379:10.91]Does this hit everybody?
[379:11.55]I can't tell.
[379:16.83]Is this going to hit a bunch of people?
[379:18.17]Where should I put it?
[379:29.34]Oh, the dump trucks will clog it.
[379:30.44]Yeah.
[379:33.32]Alright, that's fine.
[379:35.50]Up here.
[379:36.19]Incinerator.
[379:41.45]Powered.
[379:41.87]Here we go.
[379:45.13]Pay tolls to dump garbage.
[379:54.74]Alright, is this working?
[379:55.40]$2.
[379:55.42]$4.
[379:57.24]Okay, $2.
[380:09.67]Hey!
[380:10.55]Hey!
[380:12.39]Wait a minute.
[380:14.75]Wait!
[380:15.67]They're avoiding... They're getting off at another exit.
[380:20.69]The one before.
[380:24.26]Oh.
[380:25.38]They don't want to pay the tolls.
[380:28.58]How the fuck do you get out of here?
[380:32.84]You can't get out, can you?
[380:39.17]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[380:41.19]Excuse me.
[380:42.45]Excuse me.
[380:43.01]That's not happening anymore.
[380:44.07]They have to turn... They can eventually get on this road and go this way.
[380:57.99]Not anymore.
[381:30.22]Wait, what?
[381:30.84]Wrong one?
[381:31.30]What do you mean wrong one?
[381:39.20]These are both going to attach to here.
[381:50.80]What do you mean no way into the city?
[381:55.40]Yes, there is.
[381:56.54]Because once we get to about here...
[382:00.67]I will connect this to this road here.
[382:02.49]No, I'll connect it to here.
[382:06.43]From here to here.
[382:07.22]If you want to leave, then you have to go through the rest of the tolls.
[382:09.06]If you want to stay in the city, then fucking come this way.
[382:14.98]This game is so fun.
[382:16.20]I can't believe you can actually do this shit.
[382:18.16]Alright, let's keep doing what I was doing.
[382:22.97]Do these people die?
[382:30.59]Okay, you can, like, leave this way.
[382:32.08]Uh, I don't know if I'm okay with that.
[382:36.46]Am I?
[382:36.68]Alright, let's...
[383:27.43]There we go.
[383:32.07]I have to go down there.
[383:42.27]Oh, shit.
[383:45.37]Okay, let's see.
[383:45.93]Does this work?
[383:53.68]Yep.
[383:56.42]Grand City!
[383:57.64]Oh no!
[384:08.31]My shit!
[384:09.31]There's another way in!
[384:11.05]There's another way into the city!
[384:12.77]Wait a minute, there's like three ways into the city!
[384:16.02]Oh no!
[384:17.34]My thing just goes... Not anymore!
[384:30.40]Keep going!
[384:33.23]Oh, what's this?
[384:34.21]Keep going.
[384:35.93]Road's closed.
[384:38.13]Keep going.
[384:39.45]Good luck.
[384:45.79]This is gonna be a bigger road.
[384:47.44]Upgrade.
[384:49.66]Oh, I can't upgrade that.
[384:50.46]Alright, so this could just be deleted.
[384:58.23]There's no reason for this.
[384:59.07]Okay, people can come out.
[384:59.99]That's fine.
[385:04.42]Yeah, this is alright.
[385:05.14]And then let's connect this shit right here.
[385:06.70]Whatever.
[385:07.02]Fucking... Go like this.
[385:08.46]Oops.
[385:12.74]Straight dog?
[385:23.07]There!
[385:23.67]Look.
[385:24.39]Now you can...
[385:27.52]you can fucking go this way and come back into the city does it work how are people avoiding this uh-oh what have I missed
[385:58.56]What have I missed?
[386:02.04]There's no way in?
[386:03.16]Oh, shit.
[386:08.84]Okay, yeah.
[386:09.88]From here to here.
[386:14.27]Now there is.
[386:29.58]Okay, good.
[386:33.41]Now here they all come.
[386:35.49]Perfect.
[386:35.95]Beautiful.
[386:36.79]Beautiful.
[386:40.71]You missed a road?
[386:42.49]Um... People have to be able to leave.
[386:44.69]Hold on.
[386:58.92]Wait, that means they can never leave.
[387:09.67]They're just always going to be constantly going around in a circle through my tolls.
[387:13.73]Forever.
[387:14.03]What's going on with the power situation here?
[387:28.82]I need... Okay, I need more electricity.
[387:30.14]Uh, electric, electric, electric.
[387:33.00]What do I want?
[387:35.30]Um... How about a... I don't know, this fucking solar power plant.
[387:39.50]I got money.
[387:40.00]Let's make it.
[387:40.90]Put it down here.
[387:46.28]Who cares?
[387:46.66]Is this industry or houses?
[387:54.80]No.
[387:55.12]What's the industry?
[387:56.38]Oh, everything's gone up here.
[387:58.02]Wait.
[387:59.56]I'm so turned around.
[388:01.50]It's over here.
[388:02.00]Okay.
[388:11.33]There we go.
[388:11.99]Bang.
[388:13.51]Tons and tons of fucking energy now.
[388:21.25]Very good.
[388:21.61]These need power, though.
[388:23.88]How are they not being powered?
[388:25.10]There we go.
[388:26.76]Alright.
[388:27.38]Back in business.
[388:31.62]Wait, where are these people coming from?
[388:44.29]Oh, yes, you can leave.
[388:45.97]Yes, you can.
[388:46.91]After you go through all the bullshit.
[388:50.81]You can actually leave.
[388:52.79]The only exit out of the whole town is right here.
[388:55.74]Whole Dodgers?
[388:56.86]No, they're not.
[388:59.46]That's not possible.
[389:00.28]How come I'm not making more money than this?
[389:03.88]This is like $6 a car.
[389:07.55]Is this counting?
[389:08.17]They're tailgating.
[389:18.49]I need more.
[389:21.77]Alright, here we go.
[389:38.41]Somebody's called me a psycho.
[389:43.49]Whatever.
[389:47.17]Cars charged last week.
[389:48.71]Here we go.
[389:51.47]A hundred and forty-five?
[389:54.69]Excuse me.
[389:56.29]Excuse me, this is bullshit.
[389:58.37]Um... How is that possible?
[390:05.56]Why is this not counting people?

[404:22.38]Alright, this is not even happening.
[404:40.15]What do you mean, um... Wait, is this just it?
[404:43.91]No, that's a burnt forest.

[406:22.54]What?
[406:22.69]Take caution and avoid roads and waterfronts until the water recedes.
[406:28.28]Don't I already know this?
[406:57.73]I've learned what's with their obsession with the blimps!
[407:05.69]Why are these people happy over here?
[407:06.96]Uh oh, it's mixing.
[407:07.34]Ugh.
[407:07.42]Alright, I'll see you tomorrow.
[407:08.52]I'm done.

[407:29.65]This is okay.
[407:36.77]Hey, look, we're fine.
[407:39.29]Hey, cool, cool, cool.
[407:40.38]Very good, very good, very good.
[407:43.58]Alright, so I'm not sure what I'm going to do tomorrow.
[407:45.50]We're either going to do this some more.
[407:47.24]I might.
[407:48.62]I don't know.
[407:50.34]It's up in the air.
[407:54.93]I think this is fun.
[408:00.41]I'm either going to continue doing this, start Animal Crossing, or something else completely different.
[408:07.08]We'll see.
[408:08.68]This was fucking hilarious, though.
[408:09.96]This was absolutely worth playing at least once or twice.
[408:17.58]We'll see.
[408:18.32]I'll be around pre-stream tomorrow.
[408:20.76]Thanks for watching.

[409:21.05]Oh, well, sounds like it's scuffed.
[409:23.45]Guess you could just play Doom instead.

[410:04.62]For those of you that don't know.
[410:07.00]Wait, didn't I ban this person from giving messages?
[410:10.50]I think I did.

[410:42.88]We'll find out.
[410:45.74]Alright, one time there's this guy.
[410:46.70]I wonder how it all started.
[410:47.44]One time there's this guy named Fred.
[410:48.42]Okay, he gave me some Jim Bean.
[410:49.56]Okay, I figured I wasn't gonna drink it straight.
[410:51.62]Okay, what's next?
[411:15.12]Okay, I shared it with the guys.
[411:17.36]About a month or two went by.
[411:18.64]It was slow.
[411:19.36]Okay.
[411:21.96]I started to go... I started to mix up something to... I call it... A new drink.
[411:30.54]I made 7-Ups with... It's 7-Up and whiskey.
[411:35.76]Okay.
[411:37.42]People liked it.
[411:37.94]I began to bring stuff every week.
[411:39.80]Sure, okay.
[411:42.84]I thought this girl started working there.
[411:45.12]I thought she was cute.
[411:46.06]Okay.
[411:49.53]Didn't know how.
[411:50.25]Okay, okay, okay.
[411:52.99]What's the point of this?
[411:58.32]There's got to be.
[411:58.90]There's going to be like an end here.
[412:00.60]That's going to be.
[412:02.65]There's gonna be an end here, isn't there?
[412:04.45]I'm gonna read it out loud.
[412:06.75]Okay.
[412:08.47]Started to talk to her.
[412:09.59]Okay, I brought her Long Island iced teas.
[412:12.36]Okay, you name it.
[412:13.58]Someone ratted on me.
[412:16.86]It's been two weeks.
[412:17.88]Luckily, my tax returns have been helping out.
[412:19.82]Not many dealerships are hiring right now.
[412:22.66]Hope you're doing well.
[412:23.38]Have bought towels.
[412:25.98]You dirty boy.
[412:26.84]Saw that you played Binding of Isaac and not well versed in the Bible.
[412:30.81]Here's Arnold Schwarzenegger reading the book of Genesis.
[412:35.59]I wanted to ask, can you talk for the next 15 minutes in a Boomhauer accent?
[412:40.47]Okay, this actually wasn't even that bad.
[412:43.85]I don't think this story is accurate.
[412:48.12]This story is not even accurate.
[412:50.58]This is not even a real story, I don't think.
[412:54.88]Apparently getting fired for bringing alcohol to work.
[412:57.64]Don't do that.
[412:58.16]That's a fucking huge mistake.
[413:01.40]It is accurate.
[413:02.22]I'm the girl.
[413:08.92]Freak out, you're freaking me out.
[413:10.88]You freak me out, I'll tell you.
[413:16.95]I'm the drink.
[413:17.71]It's true.
[413:19.16]I'm the guy that fired him.
[413:21.26]Well, regardless if this story is real or not, if it is, you shouldn't be doing that.
[413:25.84]Why would you be doing that?
[413:26.90]It's not real.
[413:28.00]It's not a real story.
[413:29.34]But I'm sorry about you getting fired in this story that I don't think is real.
[413:33.34]But thank you for the fucking $100.
[413:35.70]Dude, it's a lot of money.
[413:38.18]Freak out.
[413:38.64]You're freaking me out.
[413:39.64]Thank you.
[413:42.57]It's 100% real.
[413:43.59]It's true.
[413:45.11]Obster... God damn it.
[413:47.84]Officer Narwhal, thanks for the $4.
[413:49.46]I'm making a Jerma-themed planet coaster amusement park.
[413:54.52]I'm having trouble figuring out where to start.
[413:55.98]I figured the best place would be the park entrance, so here's a question.
[413:59.26]How would a Jerma-themed park entrance look?
[414:02.20]You gotta have at least five or six mascots dancing around.
[414:04.62]That's all that matters.
[414:08.68]As long as there's at least five to ten mascots in the front door, it could look however you want it to look.
[414:15.97]Good luck, though.
[414:19.51]I mean, if it's real, you shouldn't feel bad.
[414:22.76]If you're bringing fucking alcohol to work and giving it to people, you're gonna get fired.
[414:28.52]Like, what do you want me to tell you?
[414:31.45]If you start bringing booze to work and drinking on the job and giving it to all the coworkers, you're going to get fired.
[414:39.45]The boss is going to be like, hey, this is not like an old movie from the fucking 90s where it's like the boss comes in, hey, what's going on in here?
[414:49.79]Are you drinking?
[414:51.65]Yeah, man, we're drinking.
[414:53.89]Oh, well, you think you're going to get in?
[414:56.79]Let me have some, boys.
[414:58.73]That's not how this works.
[415:03.97]You're gonna lose your job if you do that.
[415:05.35]Don't do that.
[415:17.58]Jeremiah sucks when he spits the truth.
[415:19.65]What?
[415:20.91]What are you talking about?
[415:21.75]Hey, Wembley TTV!
[415:25.90]Thanks for the 250.
[415:26.32]Yeah, I talked about this earlier.
[415:27.30]I'm not trying to be your mother.
[415:28.00]I know people made that joke.
[415:29.26]But...
[415:55.98]You'd be surprised at how many people, when they know, they just do it anyways.
[416:02.23]They'll just go somewhere anyways.
[416:03.47]You'd be surprised.
[416:11.09]If you have a lockdown going on, don't take any chances.
[416:16.14]Only get essential things that you need.
[416:19.10]Just ride this shit out.
[416:23.84]Shut up, mom.
[416:26.35]I would be a very good mom, okay?
[416:28.27]I'd be a good father.
[416:31.93]I'd be like, hey, excuse me.
[416:34.25]What are you guys doing in here?
[416:35.67]Dad in the wall.
[416:47.66]Nothing.
[416:51.52]Alright.
[416:53.09]Goodnight, boys!
[416:54.49]I don't know.
[416:55.05]I'm not a father.
[416:56.27]I don't know how this works.
[416:59.70]But take care of yourself, Wembley.
[417:01.36]Don't fuck around.
[417:02.08]Do not mess around with a city or statewide lockdown.
[417:07.18]There's a reason why they're in place.
[417:10.79]Take care of yourselves.
[417:11.45]Take care of your loved ones.
[417:12.49]Take care of your friends.
[417:14.15]And just let's try to ride this out.
[417:18.94]We also had a ton of money come in.
[417:20.16]Freddy Dread gave $200 in bits.
[417:22.52]Zixia gave 100 community subs.
[417:25.24]Kriz gave $50 in bits.
[417:28.91]Just a shitload of money.
[417:29.97]Thank you, guys.
[417:32.53]All in the same five-minute span here a few hours ago.
[417:37.51]But BS88, thanks for the $3.
[417:41.16]Jerma, this is exciting to see you play this.
[417:44.27]The girlfriend and I had a great time building a city in this, and we both love it.
[417:47.93]Awesome to see you play it.
[417:48.67]Be sure to check out Biffa.
[417:51.14]He has great tips and tricks, particularly on traffic.
[417:57.62]Yeah, I didn't really understand that traffic was the thing.
[418:00.04]I thought you just built roads and... I didn't know that that was a real thing.
[418:03.96]I wonder if people... These games... This game, people can probably get so elaborate with it.
[418:07.64]I can imagine.
[418:09.15]Just the obsessive kind of... You could make so many highways so perfect and... Oh, I can imagine how cool that would be.
[418:16.87]If only I was capable.
[418:22.19]But thank you.
[418:23.13]Thanks a lot.
[418:25.43]Um, yeah, sure.
[418:26.03]Drink more water and, of course,
[418:58.01]Get the fuck out of here.
[419:00.94]Okay.
[419:06.52]Hopefully that was good enough.
[419:11.22]Happy 30th birthday.
[419:12.04]Thanks a lot.
[419:15.52]Hey, Swiggity Swanky.
[419:16.69]Thanks for the $2.50.
[419:17.79]Your aging Boston accent is slowly just morphing into Bernie's.
[419:27.46]Alright, we're gonna lower the taxes on the citizens.
[419:33.30]To 7%.
[419:33.93]Fuck, yeah.
[419:34.87]I didn't think I was even doing burning.
[419:37.37]I was.
[419:37.71]I didn't even mean to.
[419:39.75]It just happened.
[419:44.52]We went over these insane amounts of money.
[419:45.88]Snarbosis!
[419:46.10]I didn't even see this!
[420:10.55]How did I fucking miss this 20 community subs from Snarbosis?
[420:13.91]That's a shitload.
[420:14.63]How did I miss that?
[420:15.21]What was going on?
[420:20.73]That's a 20 drop.
[420:23.11]Thank you, Snarbosis, if you're still here.
[420:24.60]That's a lot of money.
[420:29.52]Thank you.
[420:34.18]Thanks, though.
[421:08.38]Fuck, what am I gonna do tomorrow?
[421:09.40]I'm gonna have to, like, flip a three-sided coin tomorrow and figure out what the hell I want to do.
[421:13.80]There's too much shit that's out.
[421:16.10]Apple shit thanks to the 250.
[421:17.21]Yo, man, I'm sure it's already been asked, but how's quarantine treating you?
[421:20.57]Hope you're doing alright.
[421:21.75]My school's been canceled for the time being, so I've been catching up on VODs while sitting around drawing, which is definitely a silver lining to all this.
[421:29.41]um just been sitting and around and hanging out we thankfully got a few weeks ago for the last two weeks before um the I mean if you don't know Vegas is now in the state of Nevada is on essential business lockdown which is grocery stores are open and uh I think like banks and uh like hospitals and everything
[421:56.48]But all non-essential businesses are not open anymore in Las Vegas, so... Following suit for a lot of other towns and cities in the world and in the country.
[422:07.26]But, yeah, I haven't really... I haven't left the house, really.
[422:10.21]I've had some stuff... I've had some really, really important... Here's the worst part about this.
[422:14.22]There's a lot of important shit that's going on in my current life that is hard to take care of now.
[422:22.63]For those of you that do not know, I haven't really talked that much about it because I didn't want to make a big deal about it.
[422:27.97]I've been talking about it in a pre-stream recently, but I am moving.
[422:32.59]Kim and I are moving to a new place.
[422:36.21]And it's happening very soon.
[422:39.21]And it's just like, holy shit.
[422:41.43]This all is coming at this point right now.
[422:44.75]Uh, we're staying in Vegas.
[422:45.71]No, no, no.
[422:45.99]We're not moving.
[422:47.09]We're staying in Las Vegas.
[422:48.27]We're not moving back to Boston.
[422:52.87]So... This is essentially the first year or two here.
[422:59.20]Was to see if we really liked it.
[423:01.82]And then, okay, did... Did we like this?
[423:04.74]Did we want to stay?
[423:07.79]We wanted to downsize a little bit, and... There's a lot of reasons as to why we wanted to change places.
[423:13.29]I wanted to get better internet.
[423:14.31]That's another one.
[423:18.07]The fucking people driving by, the vroomers.
[423:21.39]That was like 75... No, no.
[423:25.49]But... That's happening very soon.
[423:30.02]But I haven't really talked about it because I don't want to be like, Hey, I'm moving again, everybody get ready, or where the fuck is he going?
[423:36.15]Nah, I'm staying in Las Vegas.
[423:39.13]Just a different place.
[423:45.24]Please keep a place where people will still vroom.
[423:48.38]That's such a big deal.
[423:50.00]I gotta go to like, I call a bunch of... Hey, apartment complex number 15.
[423:55.78]Hey, um, do cars like fucking drive by really fast?
[424:00.92]Um...
[424:03.08]I don't think so.
[424:04.20]Ah, shit, sorry.
[424:06.15]Not interested.
[424:06.73]Okay.
[424:14.99]But, yeah, but it's been the last, I mean, few weeks.
[424:21.42]We're trying to figure out the smoothest way to make this a reality.
[424:26.68]And it kind of landed on the worst possible time.
[424:30.46]So... But we still are doing it.
[424:32.58]That and the medical shit that I'm doing right now.
[424:37.63]I'm trying to stay on top of it and trying to... But you can't really... It's hard to do that now.
[424:44.48]So a lot of shit in real life is starting to get affected by it too.
[424:51.21]But, you do what you gotta do.
[424:53.61]And hopefully over the next month or two, this will start to flatten out, as they say, and get better.
[425:01.91]All we can hope is over the next two, three, four months that this starts to really be on the way out.
[425:07.01]We just have to try.
[425:12.51]But, that's kind of the way it's been for the last couple weeks.
[425:17.33]But thanks for the $2.50 Apple shift.
[425:19.07]Appreciate it.
[425:23.52]Bone Jackal, thanks for the $3.
[425:25.02]I'd like to remind everyone that despite current events, my Jerma-themed birthday party is still scheduled for next week.
[425:31.80]Oh, I'm gonna burp.
[425:33.18]Though sadly, Nvidia will no longer be attending this year, as Greg has contracted it.
[425:39.64]We're making up for their absence with something even more exciting, a sub-only ball bit.
[425:43.54]And those still concerned about the spread of the disease will be providing essential oils free of charge.
[425:48.06]Hope to catch all of you there.
[425:53.18]A ball... No, it's a ball bit.
[425:54.90]That's what it says.
[425:55.66]Essential oils.
[426:02.04]What?
[426:02.90]Why would I get... Why would I want an essential oil?
[426:04.68]I don't get it.
[426:13.27]Thanks for three bucks, though.
[426:16.79]Strive's Beast, thanks for 250.
[426:18.01]Hey Jerm, just let you know that in your landfill neighborhood, people were building houses and getting sick and dying.
[426:26.60]Then abandoning the house.
[426:28.48]Then a new house would get built over the old one.
[426:31.51]The cycle repeats.
[426:46.16]You're laughing?
[426:46.90]Yeah!
[426:47.64]What do you want me to do, not?
[426:49.65]That's stupid!
[426:50.65]That's fucking ridiculous!
[426:52.25]Why is that happening?
[426:55.43]It's ha- what?
[426:56.29]I'm j- that's fucking terrible, but... Like, I- if... There's a secret tunnel!
[427:08.17]Thank you, Stripes Beast, for the 250.
[427:09.85]Thank you, Silent Serenity, for the 250.
[427:12.29]Jermo, you have some seriously boomer-esque city planning skills.
[427:14.79]I love it.
[427:15.97]That was so much traffic.
[427:17.48]Fun fact, statistical evidence suggests, as you saw, that adding more lanes only temporarily fixes traffic.
[427:23.60]The only true solution is to have a better design.
[427:26.04]Cheers.
[427:27.60]Uh, actually, it's funny, because rotaries are supposed to be the end-all, be-all, best possible way to end all traffic.
[427:37.11]A shitload of rotaries is how you fix traffic.
[427:47.05]It's not more lanes.
[427:48.03]It's not more roads.
[427:49.05]It's rotaries.
[427:53.38]It's true.
[427:54.68]Look it up.
[427:56.62]Rotary is a Boston word.
[427:58.12]Yeah, that's fine.
[427:59.79]Roundabout.
[428:00.39]There you go.
[428:01.31]Roundabout.
[428:02.19]Roundabout.
[428:02.75]Sorry.
[428:03.21]I'm from a different part of the world than you.
[428:04.81]Sorry.
[428:05.17]Let me apologize first and foremost.
[428:14.20]He's speaking in code.
[428:20.60]Anyways.
[428:23.20]Castle build.
[428:23.86]Thanks for the $5.90.
[428:26.72]I hope you do too.
[428:27.28]Hope all of you do.
[428:27.78]Because... Here's the real... I mean, I don't want to get too far into the future on this.
[428:31.50]But...
[428:56.34]If everyone's having trouble, you know, it's harder to... Like, when this stream turns on, and let's say it keeps going further, like six months from now, I'm not sure if we really keep going harder and harder and harder on this.
[429:12.11]I'd like to try to stay positive and try to have fun on these streams.
[429:14.91]I just really hope we don't get there.
[429:20.32]Like a year from now, six months from now, I hope it's really fucking over with.
[429:23.92]I hope we can really get over this as a group, a global group.
[429:29.94]Because if it's hard to get water or something... I'll be honest with you, I don't want to turn my stream on and be like, HEY EVERYBODY!
[429:50.54]That's unfortunate, but... I really don't want it to be that like that.
[429:55.36]I really don't want to get to a point where it's hopefully... Ugh, it's just every day we just keep hearing about this shit, and I really hope it's on the way out.
[430:06.01]I'll keep doing it.
[430:06.63]I will keep fucking streaming and I'll keep trying to have as much fun as I can.
[430:19.53]But, uh, honestly, like, I just want to be honest with you.
[430:23.93]Like, if I've had, even right now, for instance, right?
[430:30.07]If I'm having, like, problems in my life, it's hard for me to come on here and, like, make a bunch of jokes.
[430:37.90]Especially if something serious is going on.
[430:45.84]But I don't think we'll get that far.
[430:49.68]I mean, I say I don't think because I really hope we don't.
[430:59.86]But I'll be here.
[431:01.71]Regardless of what we're doing, I'll be here.
[431:03.15]I've got no reason to stop.
[431:06.11]I'm not going to stop doing it.
[431:16.39]And I think that, like, sometimes having... laughing and having a good time and making, you know, doing jokes and making comedies helps with everything.
[431:25.63]No matter what it is.
[431:29.63]But, I mean, obviously I'm overthinking what could potentially happen in the future.
[431:32.94]But... We'll see.
[431:39.80]Making comedies.
[431:49.37]This review refuses to stop.
[431:53.35]No, you know what I mean, though.
[431:56.14]Anyway.
[431:56.40]Take care of yourselves, please.
[431:58.94]That was pretty good.
[432:01.82]That was pretty funny.
[432:19.29]It was a lot of fun.
[432:19.85]Take care of yourself.
[432:20.45]All of you.
[432:20.77]I'm trying to as well.
[432:21.87]You know, off stream, I'm trying to do the same thing.
[432:26.27]We're all trying to do the same thing right now.
[432:50.06]Take care of yourself, thank you.
[432:52.96]I have no idea what you're talking about, but all those things sounded good to me.
[432:56.40]So.
[432:56.60]I mean, besides maybe the milk.
[432:57.86]I don't really want that.
[432:58.78]Turtle Toenail, thanks for the $50, 5000 bits.
[433:21.16]Just a few moments ago.
[433:22.12]You should change the name to Toll City.
[433:23.86]Then you'd get more... You'd get more Jerma tourists.
[433:28.60]And more money.
[433:29.30]I don't understand.
[433:35.08]Toll City?
[433:44.63]Is it an EU joke?
[433:47.99]Does Germany have a bunch of tolls?
[433:53.80]Toll means awesome in Jerma.
[433:57.58]Oh.
[433:59.82]I see.
[434:00.33]Okay.
[434:04.29]Well, thanks for the 5,000 bits, dude.
[434:05.35]Seriously.
[434:05.73]Appreciate it.
[434:09.29]Silence ready, thanks for 250.
[434:10.41]If you really want to play Animal Crossing on stream, I'd recommend you start it off stream.
[434:14.67]If you haven't already.
[434:16.03]The game is heavy, very heavily time gated.
[434:18.94]And the first day gameplay is pretty much just putting your tent down and catching fish.
[434:23.06]It would be a very slow stream.
[434:24.28]With that said, the game is very cute and relaxing.
[434:29.34]Maybe I'll play... I don't know.
[434:32.44]It's going to be a game time decision tomorrow.
[434:38.29]What I want to do.
[434:39.53]We'll see.
[434:42.77]Dinosaurus Rex, thanks for the 300 bits.
[434:44.72]Hello, Jerma.
[434:45.26]I really enjoy your streams.
[434:47.66]About a year back, I submitted some custom Guitar Hero tracks, one being the Pirate Marching Band mixed with Tachyon by Deathgrips.
[434:54.99]The other being Berries and Sterries.
[434:58.47]Well, I'm dusting off in the vault of ideas that sit behind me, once upon a time.
[435:18.49]Maybe a year or so ago.
[435:19.69]I wanted to not do the FL studio thing was like oh, that's pretty cool.
[435:23.63]What a good idea Yeah, that's a funny thing to do is make like just music on stream Scratch that I want to hire a whole band.
[435:30.89]I want to have like 17 people here like trumpet players Guitarists and stuff and then record our own music and actually have like a flat actual studios a band And just have them do like samples and shit and just make songs
[435:50.42]That was... I mean, that was a year ago now that I wanted to do that.
[435:54.44]And some things took precedence over others.
[435:58.02]That idea was around before the carnival was even... started having any work done on it, so... But... It's just... It's in a gigantic book back there.
[436:07.11]It has not been canceled.
[436:11.95]It's just dusty.
[436:12.94]That's all.
[436:14.80]It is still on the mine.
[436:18.76]Uh, Jude, Minecraft, thanks for the 300 bits.
[436:20.74]Derm, I've been feeling bad because of fibromyalgia and anemia.
[436:24.46]Streams make me feel better when I have bad days.
[436:26.25]Uh, I have an alert on my phone.
[436:28.87]Hope you're doing okay.
[436:30.11]Keep yourself safe.
[436:31.53]Tell Otto and Kim I said hi.
[436:37.15]Sorry that you're feeling that way.
[436:39.09]Sorry that you feel so bad.
[436:44.66]Fibromyalgia is...
[436:47.89]One of those conditions that it's just tough to treat.
[436:53.28]I know this because it's been potentially things that might be going on with me.
[437:04.01]So I feel for that.
[437:04.95]It hasn't been diagnosed.
[437:05.83]I'm not saying I'm diagnosed that way, but this mystery illness with random fucking just chest bone and like spine pain
[437:17.77]I don't know.
[437:21.23]Costochondritis and fibromyalgia both... They both kind of are hand in hand in a lot of ways.
[437:36.24]But I might not even have costochondritis.
[437:38.14]I might have fucking rheumatoid arthritis.
[437:42.42]This is why medical shit is so fucking annoying and...
[437:46.68]Because it's been like a year and a half.
[437:49.74]And I still don't know exactly what's fucking wrong with me.
[437:53.88]So I can relate.
[437:55.51]Trust me.
[437:56.39]I can.
[438:00.15]Sorry to hear about you having problems.
[438:08.80]And I'm happy that you feel better when you watch this stream.
[438:12.60]That makes me feel good.
[438:15.15]Thank you for the 300 bits.
[438:16.47]Thank you.
[438:16.67]What games have you given out?
[438:23.64]Yeah, that's the idea.
[438:42.95]is just keep eliminating things until there's nothing left to eliminate, and that's, here you are, this is what you have.
[438:48.13]It just, it's frustrating, because I want to just go, get it done.
[438:53.70]Just, let's go.
[438:55.08]Do it all.
[438:56.66]Do everything you need to do.
[438:57.38]It's just a slow process.
[439:01.18]What, what codes, what are these for?
[439:02.46]I'm seeing, I'm seeing codes in the chat from, from Jasoj Kajachpa.
[439:11.03]What are these?
[439:14.62]Is it bad rats?
[439:21.56]They're still going.
[439:22.64]There's another, like, three codes.
[439:27.38]Is it really bad rats?
[439:28.45]That's so funny.
[439:30.03]Well, thank you, Desoid.
[439:33.69]Whatever they are, thank you.
[439:35.51]And thanks for the huge amount of money.
[439:37.43]To me.
[439:39.51]Thank you.
[439:43.86]Uh, Devakitty, thanks for the 250.
[439:45.28]Hello, Jeremiah L. Burmingsenton.
[439:48.80]You need to arrange illegal drag races outside your new house to keep the rumors alive, or else chat will become deranged since you've made us all addicts.
[439:56.72]Please, please live close to the dumpster that Etalyx will be forced to live in when you abandon him.
[440:02.89]Be kind and upload your KFC scraps and the residual bits of poop wine to allow him to sustain himself.
[440:17.48]I think he's staying here.
[440:18.44]I think he's staying in Vegas.
[440:23.08]This was a trial period for me and Kim.
[440:25.83]It was also a trial period for him, too.
[440:27.63]I don't know his exact plans, but I'm pretty sure he's staying in Las Vegas.
[440:38.66]This is fucking so... Oh, man.
[440:43.89]Implying you are not staying in Vegas.
[440:45.43]No, I, I, me and Kim are staying in Vegas.
[440:56.39]Why did he move in with you in the first place?
[440:57.81]Well, I don't know, because we had, me and Kim were just like, we're moving out here.
[441:06.06]You gotta remember, when we first came out here, we didn't know anybody out here.
[441:10.90]I don't know anybody in this area.
[441:13.16]I mean, we do now.
[441:15.86]But, it's way easier if... Hey, you know, what's your situation like?
[441:20.50]You potentially may be looking for a place to live?
[441:23.22]I don't know, you wanna fucking go do this for like a year?
[441:26.43]And see if you like it?
[441:27.67]Yeah, I guess, sure.
[441:31.01]And now that we have had that period...
[441:35.27]That's it.
[441:36.57]And we've liked it.
[441:38.61]Both parties have enjoyed it.
[441:39.83]And now we're kind of just going our separate kind of ways.
[441:44.33]It's just the way it is.
[441:58.54]Do you have plans to have kids?
[442:00.06]Whoa, that's a loaded question.
[442:02.24]Wow.
[442:04.06]Do you have f- is it because you're gonna have kids?
[442:06.98]Whoa!
[442:13.23]No.
[442:15.25]No.
[442:17.07]Answer!
[442:17.47]I'm fucking answering!
[442:18.53]I just said no!
[442:19.21]I don't know what I'm doing in the future.
[442:27.63]I don't know what I'm doing next week, guys.
[442:29.19]You think I know what I'm doing?
[442:31.30]I don't know what could be in the cards in the fucking future.
[442:34.76]I don't... I'm gonna stop answering these questions.
[442:37.33]I'm gonna stop answering the questions.
[442:38.91]Because the more that I answer, the deeper the sinkhole gets.
[442:42.21]Let's go.
[442:45.66]Let's throw the subs.
[442:47.48]Why not?
[442:47.84]No fucking camera, right?
[442:48.78]Okay, good.
[442:49.28]I'm naked.
[442:55.55]Not in the plans.
[442:56.99]No plans.
[442:58.17]I know I'm turning like 35 this year and I'm getting a little older and it's at that point where you sort of need to decide in the next little while if it's something that you want to do because this is like the time to do it for the most part.
[443:12.69]Okay, sure.
[443:14.23]And what?
[443:15.03]No, it's not in the plans at the moment.
[443:17.45]And I'm, yes, I'm moving around a lot, but you don't, can you tell that this is not part of the plan?
[443:22.47]Okay, cool.
[443:22.89]Let's show the credits.
[443:29.78]These are all the subs today.
[443:31.22]A lot of them.
[443:40.09]Stop tagging, don't tag, Kim.
[443:42.21]There's nothing to do with this conversation.
[443:43.68]She's not, she's gonna say the same damn thing.
[443:46.18]She's gonna say, no, there's no plans at all.
[443:48.28]Zero.
[443:48.86]No, we're not doing that.
[443:49.80]I know, and that's exactly what she would say.
[443:52.44]Hey, there's a lot of subs tonight.
[443:53.72]Holy fuck, thank you guys.
[443:59.10]Thanks for the massive amount of subs.
[444:00.55]Every stream happens every fucking day.
[444:04.16]Thank you.
[444:06.61]Hey, uh, Drancree, thanks for the 1500 bits.
[444:09.75]Hey, long time fan since 2013.
[444:11.77]First time giving bits ever.
[444:13.87]Thanks for the... That's a lot.
[444:16.16]15 bucks is a lot.
[444:18.10]Just want to say that I really appreciate you, especially in the difficult time.
[444:21.22]I've been cooped up in self-isolation for about a week due to contact fears.
[444:26.31]I've recently developed a cough.
[444:28.05]I've been going a little Ster-crazy, and your streams have been such a great thing to look forward to in all of this.
[444:32.21]You do great work.
[444:37.44]Thank you for the $15 again.
[444:41.06]I will tell you though.
[444:44.76]Self-isolating.
[444:47.38]That's the right thing to do.
[444:49.00]You're doing the right thing.
[444:49.76]You're doing all the right things.
[444:54.83]Just hang in there.
[445:02.83]Hang in there.
[445:05.25]Hopefully this all will be over soon.
[445:07.76]Hopefully we don't have to worry about getting this illness or spreading it around or something, but you're doing the right thing.
[445:17.29]Yeah, it's the right thing, but isolation fucking sucks.
[445:21.37]Yeah, I know.
[445:22.31]I know, I know, I know.
[445:25.36]We are humans, we are meant to talk and converse and socialize and we're meant to do that, I know.
[445:37.69]That's why hopefully this doesn't last that long.
[445:43.23]We went to Pog?
[445:46.35]Yes, that too.
[445:47.15]I appreciate the 1500 bits though, Jren.
[445:59.26]Thanks a lot, you're doing the right thing.
[446:04.62]Morning maple and by the way, I wish you I wish that I wish you the best of health by the way Morning maple, thanks for the thousand bits Jerma thanks for doing what you do.
[446:18.03]It means a lot.
[446:18.63]This isn't related to the stream whatsoever But I remember there was this British French kids show in the early 90s called Harry Jeremy Here's the intro what?
[446:31.74]In Harry Jeremy
[446:41.64]He's not a superhero, nor a poet, or a king.
[446:45.36]He doesn't drive a car, or do much of anything, but he's Harry.
[446:52.60]He has no superpowers, and I've never seen him fly.
[446:56.25]No secret hideaway, and no all-seeing eye.
[446:59.61]He's just Harry.
[447:02.05]He's most definitely Harry.
[447:05.63]His name is Jeremy, and he's Harry.
[447:10.56]Okay, if I was still doing sub sounds, it would be this.
[447:14.62]Hey, thanks a lot for the sub there, dude.
[447:19.20]I appreciate it.
[447:21.50]Hey, thanks a lot, Mike3, for the sub.
[447:25.02]Appreciate that.
[447:25.70]Two months in a row.
[447:26.90]Hey, look at that.
[447:30.65]We got another sub from... That's a sub sound, but I don't do those anymore.
[447:40.04]Thank you, Morning Maple, for the thousand bits.
[447:41.64]Thank you, Sir Enigma, for the four dollars.
[447:44.14]Thanks for making us laugh and Karen during this shitty time.
[447:47.07]Helps take my mind off the world.
[447:50.51]Me too.
[447:52.01]So it works both ways.
[447:54.52]Sitting here having a good time takes my mind off this shit as well, so it's good.
[447:59.66]Thanks for the 400 bits.
[448:02.46]Internet Jorge, or Internet George, thanks for the $5.
[448:06.34]Jeremiah, I wish the best for you and everyone in chat.
[448:09.06]It's trying time.
[448:09.68]It's important to remember our humanity and compassion for each other.
[448:12.76]As long as we are compassionate and care for each other, we can overcome this.
[448:17.52]Love you all.
[448:18.82]It's very true.
[448:21.52]Very, very true.
[448:24.53]Just be diligent.
[448:27.21]Be aware.
[448:29.23]And take it seriously.
[448:33.85]Pretty much all we can do.
[448:37.69]Silence Serenity, thanks for 250.
[448:38.73]Hey Jeremy, can I ask you something that's kind of been bothering me lately?
[448:41.93]Okay.
[448:42.99]How did you find your calling in life?
[448:45.05]I'm in my mid-twenties and even though I'm moderately successful, I have no idea what my life goals are.
[448:51.05]How did I, how did I find my calling?
[448:54.37]Um, to be honest, I've kind of just been doing this kind of shit my whole life.
[449:02.59]Nothing made me happier in my entire life than just sitting around and telling fucking jokes, making up scenarios, playing video games and hanging out and just talking shit with my friends.
[449:19.30]I loved it more than anything.
[449:22.72]Doing this kind of stuff.
[449:24.76]What you are witnessing right now, when I turn these streams on, is the exact same kind of shit that I used to do when I was 15, 16, all the way through my mid to late, all the way into my mid-20s.
[449:39.45]Just with people sitting around on a couch, we would do the same fucking thing.
[449:44.99]So I don't know if the calling is the right word, but I've always just had this
[449:53.56]I just, I just love, I don't even know if calling is the right word.
[449:59.24]I just love sitting around and just like shooting the shit.
[450:02.32]It's all, I love it.
[450:03.60]I love it more than anything.
[450:09.98]Did you and your friends ever say pog?
[450:11.93]Well, funny story.
[450:12.99]You want to know where the inspiration for Jerma Rumble came from?
[450:18.76]This is exactly what I'm talking about.
[450:21.00]We used to... We used to, in no mercy for Nintendo 64, friends of mine would sit around and we would make characters.
[450:34.59]And this is gonna sound crazy, but we would all make our dads.
[450:41.87]And just sit there and let the CPU dads fight it out.
[450:49.86]It was like, we had so much fun.
[450:53.76]It was so, so much fun.
[450:55.86]And that's kind of, like I told you, that's what I've been doing for so long.
[451:01.13]The same thing we do here.
[451:01.97]Yeah, all of our actual CPU, just our actual dads.
[451:10.45]We would make them all, and they would all fight in an elimination match.
[451:19.13]And when you're like, dad got eliminated first, it was like, oh, come on, what the fuck?
[451:25.34]Oh, come on, dad.
[451:26.22]And everyone would be like, yeah, fuck you, you're dad's own.
[451:29.44]Like, oh, come on, he'll be here next time.
[451:33.99]That was just one of the many games we would play.
[451:37.07]Many, many, many games we would play.
[451:42.18]So long-winded, where do you get your calling?
[451:45.40]It's just the thing that you have the most fun doing, the thing that you care the most about.
[451:49.89]The best fun in games is the fun you make yourself.
[452:01.01]Yes.
[452:02.07]That is absolutely 100% accurate.
[452:10.11]And not even just video games in general, just the fun you make yourself.
[452:16.88]The fun that you create is more fun than anything that anyone can ever make for you.
[452:21.26]Let's just put it that way.
[452:28.67]Hopefully somewhere in there you got some kind of an answer.
[452:35.17]But thank you.
[452:38.10]UnZeroic, thanks for the 300 bits!
[452:41.91]When's the- oh, I gotta answer this first.
[452:43.13]When's Jerma Rumble Charity?
[452:44.91]It got moved because the Boston Marathon got moved.
[452:49.63]The Boston Marathon is on, I think, indefinite hiatus until they know exactly when they want to do it.
[452:56.07]The whole purpose of the Jerma Rumble Charity stream was to directly benefit the sponsoring of one of my friends running the marathon.
[453:04.93]In September.
[453:05.55]Okay.
[453:05.99]Yeah.
[453:07.11]And that's unfortunate.
[453:08.45]That we have to, you know, all the marathon runners, all the charities, is... We have to wait.
[453:17.14]But, that's the plan still.
[453:18.66]It is going to benefit the charity.
[453:23.71]And sponsor his run.
[453:29.01]Am I going to play Bannerlord when it comes out in a few days?
[453:30.90]Probably not.
[453:32.26]You'll probably not see me play Bannerlord.
[453:35.12]Judging by how much I did not really do very well in the first one.
[453:41.67]So, maybe.
[453:42.81]But probably not.
[453:43.49]But maybe.
[453:44.29]But probably not.
[453:49.33]But thank you for the 300 bits.
[453:52.17]Hey, Neurowolfy, thanks for the $5.
[453:55.68]Jerma, look at this.
[453:58.53]It's me jumping around in my room.
[454:00.39]It says quarantined on it.
[454:05.21]Best fun is the fun you make yourself.
[454:12.68]Thank you, though.
[454:15.56]So what are we going to do tomorrow?
[454:17.22]I should probably figure it out right now.
[454:18.32]What are we going to do tomorrow?
[454:20.43]What are we doing tomorrow?
[454:21.01]I got to figure it out now.
[454:21.99]I don't want to sleep on this.
[454:23.17]What are we doing?
[454:29.20]Uh, Animal Crossing, Doom, Viva Pinata, Dreams, DOS games.
[454:34.67]Ah, there's so many things to choose from.
[454:36.03]I got tons of shit over here too.
[454:39.57]Mmm.
[454:42.69]What do I want to do?
[454:43.75]Should I play Doom?
[454:44.53]Should I play Doom?
[454:50.70]Doom.
[454:53.50]Is Doom, is it good?
[454:55.76]Is it a good game?
[455:01.95]Doom sucks.
[455:02.89]What?
[455:04.37]Should I play Animal Crossing?
[455:05.37]Alright, here we go.
[455:06.85]There's a shitload of people here now.
[455:08.19]I'm gonna do this poll tomorrow in the chat, if I don't do it now, with 70% less people.
[455:15.52]So, I don't know.
[455:17.26]I will do any of these things.
[455:18.42]I'm just so indecisive.
[455:20.26]Doom, uh, Animal Crossing, um, New Leaf, what was it called?
[455:27.09]Whatever, Animal Crossing.
[455:28.03]I'm gonna say Animal Crossing Switch.
[455:37.05]Uh... Okay, so these sky lines part two.
[455:41.59]Okay.
[455:42.37]This is... I'm alright with any of these.
[455:44.15]Okay, here we go.
[456:00.16]It's gonna be one of these, so might as well just do it.
[456:02.24]Here we go.
[456:03.24]Oh.
[456:04.32]What am I doing tomorrow?
[456:11.62]The new Half-Life game.
[456:12.82]I can't really do VR right now.
[456:15.74]As much as I would like to.
[456:20.50]It's one of those things I just... Until I get this medical bullshit resolved, I can't really move that much around in one stream.
[456:28.27]Alright, what are we doing?
[456:30.87]Are you voting?
[456:33.15]All the people that have very, very adverse opinions to what currently could or could not be in first place, there's only been 300 votes.
[456:39.43]And there's 2,400 people here.
[456:46.75]Come on.
[456:48.79]Pick something.
[456:53.15]Pick something.
[457:03.24]This is close.
[457:04.32]You're close.
[457:04.98]15%.
[457:07.84]I'm going to close this.
[457:11.66]In.
[457:16.93]Ten seconds.
[457:18.03]Ten.
[457:18.73]And whatever it is, at the- at the- when I stop, the moment I stop, is gonna be what we're doing.
[457:22.73]Ten.
[457:24.11]Nine.
[457:25.30]Eight.
[457:26.44]Seven.
[457:27.72]Six.
[457:29.02]Five.
[457:30.28]Four.
[457:31.50]Three.
[457:32.82]Two.
[457:34.24]One.
[457:35.18]We're playing Animal Crossing tomorrow.
[457:37.14]Done.
[457:38.81]That was- oh- No, you don't play- Did you- did you vote?
[457:41.57]No?
[457:41.77]Okay.
[457:48.40]Okay.
[457:49.99]Hey!
[457:56.12]Actually, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, I'm not, alright.
[458:01.54]Hey, goo berry juice, thanks for the $2.50.
[458:02.78]Right at the end.
[458:05.04]Hey, not to rag on you, but I just want to say that the amount... The moment you started doing this shit, was the moment the city started to be ruined.
[458:12.00]Like, I was actually getting... It was actually... I was getting so loud, because I'm drunk on a Friday night, and I was going eww out loud to the point where my neighbors heard me and called a noise complaint.
[458:22.39]Anyway, I'm going to go throw up and pog into the toilet.
[458:24.71]What the fuck are you talking about?
[458:26.62]What is going on?
[458:38.42]What?
[458:38.70]When I made the- I made the- I made a road.
[458:41.42]They didn't like the way that I made the road.
[458:43.38]And they freaked out.
[458:46.33]And I got a noise complaint.
[458:47.75]Okay.
[458:51.51]I don't- What's wrong with the roads?
[458:52.65]Fuck.
[458:56.08]They were drunk.
[458:57.66]Alright, I'm- Alright, I'll see you- I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[459:02.84]I'll see you tomorrow.
[459:03.48]Goodbye.
[459:03.98]Goodnight.
[459:04.54]I'm outta here.
[459:25.80]you
