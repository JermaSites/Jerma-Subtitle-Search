[00:00.21]The no-good bandit is hiding somewhere in these ravines.
[00:06.82]I'll catch him and save that sheep, or my name isn't Pontius the Brave.
[00:17.43]Hey, I'm Pontius the Brave, too.
[00:19.35]I just threw up another person.
[00:21.09]Oh, hey, by the way, I'm the you, too.
[00:23.91]No, I'm the you.
[00:24.83]No, I'm the real me.
[00:25.69]Brambe, press WASD.
[00:27.33]Fine.
[00:31.10]Hit the watermelon.
[00:32.20]Oh, why?
[00:33.16]Why are we doing this?
[00:33.66]It's the boss.
[00:33.96]It's the first boss.
[00:35.00]First boss, watermelon.
[00:42.84]Guys, I don't think this is the puzzle.
[00:45.11]Okay, okay, stop.
[00:46.57]Please, please, please, please, please.
[00:50.91]I'm like desperately trying to rip something like monsters sucking me up right now.
[00:54.91]I'm like, get me out of here.
[00:55.85]It's got me.
[00:58.16]I don't think I can help.
[00:59.33]Let's pound the ground desperately.
[01:01.93]I'm trying to swim.
[01:02.91]It worked.
[01:03.87]Hey, okay.
[01:05.63]It worked.
[01:06.15]Nice.
[01:06.37]See?
[01:08.65]Oh, you can attach it.
[01:11.29]I got it.
[01:11.61]Okay.
[01:12.07]You're going to have to move it though.
[01:15.61]Trevor, how did you get down there?
[01:16.93]I don't know.
[01:18.03]What the fuck, dude?
[01:19.47]Get up.
[01:20.37]I can't.
[01:22.91]Yeah.
[01:24.05]That's lame.
[01:26.01]What is wrong with this game?
[01:28.45]Oh.
[01:28.65]That was crazy.
[01:32.01]Oh, no.
[01:32.45]This is going to be the worst.
[01:33.63]Oh, no.
[01:34.39]Hold on a second.
[01:35.39]Hold on.
[01:35.69]Let me show you something really important.
[01:39.95]No.
[01:41.28]No.
[01:42.04]You want a cube?
[01:45.42]It's me.
[01:46.24]It's me.
[01:46.80]No!
[01:47.32]No!
[01:47.68]No!
[01:48.22]I'm too weak.
[01:49.12]I'm too weak, Anakin.
[01:56.24]Oh yeah.
[01:57.22]Hey guys, it's me.
[01:58.24]This is OG Wizard.
[02:00.29]Hey, what's going on?
[02:01.45]I'm the archer of the group.
[02:03.79]I'm the Knight of the Turbulent Wind.
[02:06.03]Woo!
[02:07.21]And we are the Three Triners.
[02:11.40]He's going to swing and I can hit him right in his kneecap.
[02:13.68]No, don't hit him.
[02:14.68]Go into his log.
[02:16.28]Oh, I broke his arm off.
[02:18.44]You were saying don't hit him and you just chopped his arm off.
[02:22.12]Well, I got mad, okay?
[02:23.40]Look, he's hurting us.
[02:24.30]Holy shit, how did you come back out of that one?
[02:28.24]I wasn't expecting him to care that I took his arm off.
[02:34.17]I just sat on one.
[02:44.46]Every time I make a box, there is already a rope on it.
[02:47.32]What?
[02:48.04]What?
[02:49.70]Are you trying to tie your shoes?
[02:52.08]I'm really making like a knot.
[02:55.47]Hold on.
[02:59.55]I can increase the slack.
[03:00.49]Get serious.
[03:01.37]Oh, no.
[03:01.87]I wanted to make a giant knot.
[03:03.86]I'm off with this guy!
[03:08.64]Cuphead!
[03:10.88]I'm on his lure.
[03:12.76]He's going to fish with me.
[03:13.86]That doesn't... He thinks you're a fish.
[03:21.20]Is he gonna, like, take me and eat me?
[03:25.84]What a dumbass.
[03:26.66]Alright, bye guys.
[03:27.71]You did your part.
[03:29.09]Yeah.
[03:30.13]I'm like this guy's food.
[03:34.30]Alright.
[03:36.30]We'll see you later.
[03:39.54]I'm really going with him.
[03:40.66]He's taking me away.
[03:41.70]Drupal, I'll save you.
[03:45.30]No.
[03:45.98]I'm gone.
[03:49.98]You died.
[03:50.44]You died.
[03:51.08]He killed me.
[03:51.72]He ate you right there.
[03:52.96]Wow.
[03:56.47]Medivh's castle.
[03:59.01]I can't believe we're finally going to meet Medivh.
[04:08.65]We have to try that again.
[04:11.97]I'll get it.
[04:12.39]Throw it over there.
[04:13.51]Oh, I'm standing over here.
[04:15.60]Yeah!
[04:16.60]I made it.
[04:17.56]Can you push this thing down?
[04:19.50]Push the bridge down, yeah.
[04:20.84]Yeah, I'll get the bridge.
[04:22.90]Four stardust.
[04:23.64]I don't think I can do it.
[04:26.88]Oh, no, we have to destroy the... Oh, what is this?
[04:34.68]Me first.
[04:37.22]Oh my god.
[04:39.84]You're going all in the end?
[04:40.94]I skipped it.
[04:41.38]Oh my god, I'm leaving behind!
[04:42.58]I'm gonna throw up.
[04:43.68]This seriously is... Oh my god.
[04:45.72]Jerma!
[04:46.00]Jerma, please!
[04:46.70]I'm just gonna go in.
[04:48.27]You got it, you got it, you got it.
[04:49.45]We're skipping to the end.
[04:50.37]You gotta do this.
[04:51.01]Just hold the pizza.
[04:51.59]You're skipping on the triangles!
[04:52.67]Just hold the pizza!
[04:53.81]I got it!
[04:54.19]There we go.
[04:56.07]There's so many triangles in there.
[04:57.17]There's so many.
[04:57.93]Yeah, but I don't want to die.
[04:58.73]I want to revive.
[04:59.59]Which one is the left?
[05:00.19]Stand in the middle of the Venn diagram.
[05:02.23]Yep.
[05:03.37]Alright, we have to get the triangles.
[05:08.40]Whoa, we're in the lifestream.
[05:12.48]Wow, we're totally just will-a-wonka-ing.
[05:13.90]Will-a-wonka-ing?
[05:14.76]Willy-wonka-ing right now.
[05:16.22]Will-a-wonka-ing.
[05:16.97]Will-a-wonka-ing.
[05:18.09]Wee.
[05:19.37]Wee.
[05:20.09]How come you're the only one on the screen?
[05:21.97]I want some screen time.
[05:22.67]Because you guys aren't swimming up.
[05:24.27]You have to swim up.
[05:25.37]I'm holding A. I'm mashing A. I'm going to hold A. Okay.
[05:31.01]What?
[05:31.31]What?
[05:32.14]What?
[05:32.60]That was me.
[05:35.78]How were you already up?
[05:38.90]I don't know.
[05:39.36]I was already up.
[05:41.98]We're really ronkening.
[05:43.08]We're really ronkening.
[05:44.18]We're really ronkening.
[05:46.18]We're really ronkening.
[05:50.79]That's a giant lizard.
[05:51.65]Point the laser at the moon and shoot it.
[05:53.67]Faking out.
[05:56.25]This is all you.
[06:00.51]I have no perception of where that is.
[06:02.43]Go left.
[06:02.89]Just jump left.
[06:05.83]Now come back.
[06:07.37]Jeremiah, am I helping?
[06:08.77]Am I helping you see?
[06:09.79]No, you just swing your way back.
[06:11.99]Do you want me to activate that device or something?
[06:15.23]Jeremiah, are we helping you see?
[06:18.01]You know, it would be great if I could actually see where I was right now so I could continue the puzzle.
[06:22.68]Jeremiah, this dust cloud will... Oh, I did.
[06:25.03]Oh, I'm dead.
[06:26.25]Somehow, I'm the one that's alive.
[06:30.41]I don't know how you survived it.
[06:36.84]This is the boss.
[06:38.44]No, why did you go back out?
[06:48.44]Why am I still alive?
[06:51.80]Yeah, you are still alive.
[06:52.91]You're still there.
[06:54.47]You're still on it.
[06:56.63]You're still on it.
[07:02.57]That was amazing.
[07:04.05]Somebody just grabbed a cane and put it around your neck and pulled you off the stage.
[07:07.91]Eventually, he managed to make himself immortal.
[07:17.22]Oh, I'm the dumbass.
[07:20.26]Oh, you both died.
[07:21.95]No, I just wasn't looking at where I was walking because those folks were killing me.
[07:25.85]You cared too much about me dying.
[07:28.60]And now this all-powerful, insane sorcerer wants to... I just like kaizo blocked you.
[07:33.93]God, I don't even know you two.
[07:35.37]You really did.
[07:36.47]I really don't know you two.
[07:37.91]You just kaizo blocked me.
[07:40.21]Hey, try and jump.
[07:41.09]I'm not going to make a block appear above your head.
[07:44.08]Okay.
[07:46.04]Let's do this rationally.
[07:49.00]By the book.
[07:58.02]This is the hardest part of the whole game.
[07:59.93]This gap is too big.
[08:02.09]Looks like it's moving.
[08:07.05]Yeah, oh boy, oh boy.
[08:08.51]Okay, ready?
[08:09.27]Let's close the door.
[08:14.03]Thanks for watching Trine 3!
[08:17.99]What's with your arm?
[08:20.44]Get the door open!
[08:23.34]Jerma, we're waiting.
[08:24.62]Trine!
