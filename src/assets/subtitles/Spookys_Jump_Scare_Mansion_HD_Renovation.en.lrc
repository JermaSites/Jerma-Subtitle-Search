[ve:60.16.100]

[00:00.95]Hey.
[00:10.38]Too early?
[00:11.38]That's right.
[00:13.16]I've got to be better at this stream starting soon, screen.
[00:17.81]I think.
[00:18.15]Because here's the thing.
[00:21.29]I feel like when I sit here and I'm ready to start streaming...
[00:27.12]I press the turn on stream button, start streaming.
[00:32.01]And then I'm ready to go.
[00:34.51]I'm ready to stream.
[00:38.55]So I feel like I should just press that button and then like go get, but I'm here.
[00:42.86]I'm ready.
[00:44.61]It's kind of an awkward situation where I press the button and I'm just sitting here, just looking at chat, waiting to unmute.
[00:52.95]And I'm like, should I do it now?
[00:56.06]Should I do it in like two minutes?
[00:58.60]I guess take a sip of my water.
[01:02.78]There's maybe a handful of scenarios where that screen's been on and I've had to go to the bathroom quick.
[01:11.42]Some streamers do a full 10 to 20 minutes of a starting soon screen.
[01:17.93]I've seen like 5 minute starting soons, 10 minute, 20 minute.
[01:23.49]I feel like that's too much for me.
[01:32.93]Some do 50 minutes.
[01:36.19]An hour?
[01:38.39]A full hour?
[01:41.56]Holy shit.
[01:48.83]I guess it makes sense for people that stream very long on Twitch.
[01:54.47]I guess if you press the start streaming button and you stream for like 12 hours, it's not that big of a deal.
[02:02.36]And there's another argument there where, well, most people don't even come to the stream.
[02:08.88]until 30 40 plus minutes have gone by so I guess it makes sense some people are just hopping in on notifications after 10 20 minutes I guess it makes sense but my attention span if I press the start streaming button I don't know I'm I'm I'm concerned if I press the start
[02:38.87]I just got burp murdered, is what happened.
[02:43.11]Somebody just came up behind me and murdered me and burped at the same time.
[02:48.05]God.
[02:48.47]Alright, anyways.
[02:51.24]So... Anyways, what was I saying?
[02:53.98]Right.
[02:54.94]I would be afraid that if I had my stream just going on my computer up here, for like 35, 40 straight minutes, me internally would always think that, like, is a mic on?
[03:06.99]What if they hear me, like, singing in the shower?
[03:10.23]What if they hear me blowing my nose?
[03:11.61]What if I... There's a lot of mic unmuted scenarios that could happen there.
[03:21.90]No, usually... I usually do about two or three minutes.
[03:24.16]And then about five minutes total.
[03:28.52]Until we do the... Like that.
[03:35.67]So today we're going to do Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion HD Remake.
[03:41.61]HD renovation.
[03:45.05]The reason why we're doing this instead of Darkwood is I just want to break it up a little.
[03:49.79]Because I want to play more Darkwood, but I don't want to play Darkwood like three days in a row.
[03:56.81]I'd rather do this first, and however long.
[03:58.85]If this takes five, six, seven hours, then whatever.
[04:01.93]We'll go back to Darkwood tomorrow.
[04:04.06]But if this is like three hours or less, if this is only a couple hours, I've heard this can range between like two and six hours.
[04:13.37]So, whatever the case is, we're streaming tomorrow too.
[04:18.02]We'll see.
[04:21.78]It has this music that's just playing.
[04:26.40]This is a very highly requested game.
[04:28.16]I got this request a bunch of times.
[04:30.46]And if I don't like the game, then I'm just going to play Darkwood.
[04:34.22]If the game is short, I'm going to play Darkwood.
[04:35.62]I'm going to play Darkwood tomorrow.
[04:38.33]So we'll see more Darkwood.
[04:40.45]I 100% guarantee if there's no Darkwood tomorrow, then... Actually, I can't say this.
[04:45.63]What if I, like, break my leg?
[04:47.47]Okay, so... If I... Never mind.
[04:56.02]I'm ready.
[04:56.36]This is Darkwood.
[04:58.68]It's not Darkwood.
[04:59.48]This is Spooky's Jumpscare Mansion.
[05:02.68]I don't know much about this game.
[05:03.73]All I know about this game is that I don't want to play endless mode.
[05:07.65]You have to go through a bunch of rooms and they all jumpscare.
[05:09.83]So by the way, I need to make this very clear.
[05:12.23]This game is going to flash you.
[05:14.31]It's going to make loud noises.
[05:15.77]It's going to scream and it's going to flash the screen and shit.
[05:18.07]So just be aware of that.
[05:19.21]Be careful.
[05:21.80]Okay, the mansion.
[05:22.68]Renovated version of the original.
[05:24.20]Why don't I just do that one?
[05:26.20]Unlock the secrets of the strange hospital.
[05:29.00]Build your own mansion.
[05:30.00]Alright, we're gonna just do the regular one.
[05:31.86]The one that... This one.
[05:39.05]Is this part of the game?
[05:39.75]Do I have to, like, fight the controller?
[05:58.31]Okay.
[06:01.79]So, uh, welcome.
[06:02.89]We're in room zero.
[06:05.13]Is there a punch?
[06:06.77]First jump scare.
[06:07.53]I am spooky.
[06:14.45]And this is my home.
[06:15.27]Can you, humble player, make it through a thousand rooms?
[06:20.02]I have to do a thousand of these.
[06:21.64]Or is there even an end?
[06:23.64]I don't really know.
[06:27.64]Anyway, just go.
[06:34.33]I gotta turn it off.
[06:34.94]It's too quiet.
[06:39.40]Yeah, I... This jump scare is on!
[06:44.18]What if I turn him off?
[06:46.16]What's the point of playing the game?
[06:47.38]I'm gonna play Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion.
[06:55.75]But, like, story mode.
[06:57.65]It's just baby mode.
[06:58.67]Put it at 69.
[07:00.76]No.
[07:01.32]I'll do 50, where it should be.
[07:04.12]I turned off motion blur.
[07:05.38]I had to tell you about that, too, because that's fucked up.
[07:09.90]Apply.
[07:11.43]Better.
[07:12.37]No, it's louder for you now.
[07:13.85]I'm turning it down.
[07:14.45]Alright, let's go.
[07:16.63]Jump scare mansion.
[07:19.21]Turn the DPI down on my mouse, please.
[07:22.63]Is there a DPI button?
[07:23.99]Input.
[07:25.25]Mouse.
[07:27.51]UI.
[07:28.43]No.
[07:28.75]In-game.
[07:30.15]Where's my DPI reducer?
[07:31.33]I missed it.
[07:36.05]It was there.
[07:38.60]In-game.
[07:53.54]Oh, it's... Look down at 1.0.
[07:57.56]Okay, I'm gonna... You do 8.
[08:02.26]No, 7.
[08:02.58]Let's see if that's better.
[08:08.86]Yeah, that feels better.
[08:14.43]Alright, let's go.
[08:20.07]So, if this is Jumpscare Mansion, I'm gonna assume that every single room screams at you.
[08:25.68]Is that for real?
[08:26.44]Because, I mean, I know that's gonna happen now.
[08:31.52]I know that somebody's gonna scream in my face right here.
[08:37.50]You've kind of given away the whole point of the game.
[08:42.19]Is this it?
[08:47.07]What'd it say?
[08:48.50]At first, this place just seemed cute.
[08:50.62]But I've been here for days now.
[08:52.62]Feeling quite parched now.
[08:54.17]And I keep getting this feeling like I'm being watched by something.
[08:56.49]This is not romantic at all.
[09:06.21]Just jump scare mansion.
[09:08.75]Thank God I only had one coffee today.
[09:15.51]But that's the thing.
[09:15.97]If you know it's gonna happen, how do they get you when you... Okay, pumpkins in the walls.
[09:20.27]Person in the ceiling.
[09:21.15]Something outside?
[09:30.28]No.
[09:32.18]It's a cloud.
[09:34.18]Can I open... Draw.
[09:37.14]Something's gonna come out of the... Draw.
[09:40.12]No.
[09:42.34]That's nothing in here.
[09:44.30]I've been playing too much Darkwood, which by the way, it's coming back soon.
[09:47.14]In a day or so.
[09:49.72]What is that?
[09:54.12]Is this a puzzle game?
[10:05.43]No.
[10:11.69]I have two ways to go now.
[10:15.86]Left or right door?
[10:16.82]Is this a bigger room?
[10:23.69]No, okay.
[10:29.41]Pick the middle one.
[10:30.57]I get the bad end.
[10:31.37]Choices matter.
[10:32.31]Is that... Are you kidding?
[10:33.15]Or is that real?
[10:34.33]Alright, I'm almost... I'm 1% of the way there.
[11:00.82]This game takes four hours to beat?
[11:02.58]I guess that makes sense.
[11:03.78]You just have to walk through a thousand rooms.
[11:08.62]Alright, I'm gonna go.
[11:09.42]I went left before.
[11:10.06]I'm gonna go right now.
[11:13.65]I have a health bar.
[11:14.35]What's the energy bar for?
[11:26.21]For the jump scare mansion, you've got one jump scare in 13 rooms, and it was pumpkin.
[11:35.66]Can I go back through the other door?
[11:36.88]No.
[11:38.88]There's gotta be another jump scare coming up.
[11:41.76]Was it every, like, 20 rooms?
[11:44.60]Yep, there it is.
[11:45.82]Here it is.
[11:47.73]I know something is following me, but I feel like I'm prancing through the same rooms over and over, right?
[11:54.08]Hopefully leaving notes as breadcrumbs will prove I'm making progress and reaching some destination.
[11:59.12]I just hope I don't run out of ink.
[12:00.44]I'm dreadfully thirsty.
[12:07.73]This is me leaving these notes.
[12:09.81]Because I'm stuck in a time loop.
[12:14.93]The pumpkin scared him more.
[12:16.21]Yeah, because the pumpkin made a noise.
[12:18.05]It made a loud, like... The skeleton just showed up.
[12:34.29]Oh, maze time.
[12:43.68]Okay.
[12:46.95]18.
[12:49.03]Holy shit, that's a sprint.
[12:50.97]You can sprint, and it goes too fast.
[12:53.25]I'm not using the sprint.
[13:00.34]There's a lot of doors here.
[13:01.30]This one.
[13:08.28]Bed.
[13:10.25]Are there items?
[13:11.59]I don't think so.
[13:12.15]I think I get it.
[13:12.71]I think you just keep going.
[13:19.32]It only happens twice!
[13:20.68]Wasn't I in this room before?
[13:24.69]Now please don't tell me this is one of these games where you have to- it's like a maze and you have to figure out the maze.
[13:34.75]I went in the left door last time.
[13:46.56]I haven't... 24... Am I going... What's wrong with my neck?
[14:05.97]Somebody just said, neck.
[14:07.07]Your neck.
[14:07.73]Your neck.
[14:08.27]What's wrong with it?
[14:23.80]I think I'm doing something wrong.
[14:25.30]Yep, I have ink.
[14:27.04]Not quite quenching my thirst.
[14:28.55]Taste is terrible.
[14:29.45]Stains are terrible.
[14:30.99]I don't think drinking it was a very romantic idea.
[14:33.33]Why is everything romantic?
[14:36.35]I am leaving these notes.
[14:40.47]Because I remember the little skeleton body here.
[14:42.03]He's going to jump up right now.
[14:43.66]No?
[14:44.04]Okay.
[15:00.50]It's gonna happen, like, a hundred more times.
[15:08.26]Because it doesn't matter if something's scary or not, or if you know it's gonna happen.
[15:11.75]If somebody just jumps in front of you and yells, you're gonna be like, oh!
[15:17.85]See, like, I know, I know they're happening, but it doesn't matter.
[15:20.45]Like, it just, it's a startling thing.
[15:22.29]Uh, it looks like they've increased the frequency of these.
[15:31.02]You can always tell when I really actually get scared by something.
[15:33.18]We talked about this yesterday during Darkwood, but if my hand comes up and I start to like play the guitar in the air, that means that that's a real reaction.
[15:47.29]Any other time if I'm like, whoa!
[15:49.94]No, that's bullshit.
[15:51.82]Bullshit.
[15:54.62]I start like playing an invisible flute.
[15:56.44]Oh, all this.
[15:57.10]Oh, yeah.
[15:57.96]Terrified.
[16:14.43]I've only done 36 of these.
[16:27.85]It's the constant running that I think gets you.
[16:30.05]Because your brain is going forward, and then it... What's that?
[16:50.30]This is me.
[16:50.60]Okay.
[17:20.97]I'm gonna pre-yell too.
[17:22.69]I think that'll help too.
[17:23.97]If my body is ready and I'm tense already, if I scream beforehand, I won't scream at the actual jumpscare.
[17:29.92]I think it works.
[17:36.58]People are gonna think I'm fucking crazy.
[17:57.32]I need to test my hypothesis.
[18:08.59]You have to exhale too.
[18:20.15]No inhale, exhale.
[18:29.63]Because then you can't go... I'm just going to do pregnancy classes.
[18:48.09]Locked.
[18:51.51]Okay.
[19:02.17]Keep a little pep in your step.
[19:05.93]I'm just waiting for everything to do it.
[19:10.55]You can do it.
[19:11.45]We can help.
[19:12.25]Papa John's.
[19:17.17]Papa John's sucks, by the way.
[19:22.49]Oh, it's a save point.
[19:23.51]Alright.
[19:33.32]It does not.
[19:34.60]I mean, it does.
[19:36.00]It's not very good.
[19:39.04]Papa Gino is way better than Papa John's.
[19:42.05]Like a thousand times better.
[19:49.79]Those of you who don't know Papa Gino's, you don't know the true meaning of chain pizza.
[19:54.97]It's because his name is Gino.
[19:56.66]No, that's not why.
[19:57.74]I mean, that helps.
[20:00.12]It's not the reason.
[20:07.69]Can I crouch?
[20:10.09]Okay, 51.
[20:11.15]We're almost... 5% of the... We're 5.1% of the way there.
[20:46.20]you are here where I think that's the point this is a good map
[21:08.75]Sounds like something's at the end of this hall.
[21:22.94]This is why I can't do these games, and you wonder, whoa, where's Scare Saturdays?
[21:26.27]Scare Saturdays used to hurt me.
[21:29.19]That's why every Saturday I would just be like, I have to do another one of these and I don't want to do it.
[21:34.92]But it was Saturday, so I had to do it.
[21:36.84]Because I said, I'm going to do scare Saturdays every Saturday.
[21:41.28]After doing that for like four, five, six weeks in a row, I was like, it's Friday and how do I not do this on Saturday?
[21:52.68]I thought it was fun for like eight weeks in a row.
[21:56.78]He hates streaming.
[22:02.39]No.
[22:05.39]What does it have to do with streaming?
[22:08.55]That has nothing to do with live streaming.
[22:10.89]It's scary jump in your face games.
[22:14.00]They make me ill.
[22:21.16]That's like saying...
[22:23.43]Oh, that chef really doesn't like stabbing himself in the chest with his kitchen knife.
[22:28.56]He must hate, he hates cooking.
[22:30.44]He hates cooking.
[22:31.36]He hates, he hates streaming.
[22:55.55]Slime.
[22:56.19]It's gonna pop up.
[23:02.15]This is a red herring.
[23:08.37]This is a red herring.
[23:09.87]It's gonna come over here.
[23:13.01]Yep, it's a red herring.
[23:16.37]Spouting, splashing, soaking, innards, ingest, invoking, nailing, never stops, the choking.
[23:26.38]I told you.
[23:27.04]I told you he was gonna get up.
[23:29.40]Ah, there's health in the game.
[23:30.65]They have a health bar.
[23:35.25]Wait, they all get up!
[23:37.07]Wait, he's following me around in every room?
[23:38.95]No, he's not.
[23:45.07]Please.
[23:46.17]Please.
[23:47.47]You think I'm gonna pay attention to the little ghost?
[23:50.73]He is chasing me through every room.
[23:54.04]There's no jump.
[24:02.53]Uh oh.
[24:03.31]Oh, good thing I didn't go to the chair route.
[24:10.41]I'm good.
[24:36.74]How long does this last for?
[24:41.82]This is not just for the rest of the game, right?
[24:44.06]Another, like, 932 floors of this?
[24:45.82]Hey!
[25:07.30]I can't go in that door I think I'm safe
[25:36.66]Okay, I got it.
[25:37.66]I have a fucking dot on me.
[26:09.51]He's taking poison damage!
[26:20.49]I fucking hate this.
[26:21.39]I need, I don't, it doesn't matter.
[26:25.62]There's a thousand of these rooms?
[26:27.84]Why would I do this?
[26:32.26]Of like the four to five thousand of you that requested this.
[26:38.27]It was actually, like, six people.
[26:41.05]But still.
[26:50.30]Wait for that to recharge.
[26:51.10]It was seven.
[26:54.58]He just really doesn't.
[26:55.36]He just hates streaming.
[27:03.98]He doesn't want, he hates streaming.
[27:06.04]It's like, I think that's like my favorite comment in the last like week.
[27:23.11]Almost 10% of the way there.
[27:25.05]It's been 30 minutes?
[27:27.13]So that's 100 rooms in 30 minutes, which means that's 10%.
[27:31.32]So 3, 6, 9, 12, 14, 18, 21, 24, 27, 30.
[27:32.18]This is going to take 3 hours.
[27:34.14]That was the easiest math problem ever.
[27:37.28]And I made that so much more complicated for no reason.
[27:57.32]Uh-oh!
[27:57.62]There's another one of these guys!
[27:58.50]Yeah, this is how many?
[28:10.29]Two?
[28:11.01]Alright, just stay ahead of them.
[28:15.85]Here it comes.
[28:19.13]We're gonna be one in the hallway here.
[28:20.03]It's gonna be like, boom!
[28:21.01]Almost hit a hundred.
[28:58.16]10% of the way there.
[28:59.64]Keep that blood pumping.
[29:00.90]I'm actually alright.
[29:03.81]So, I've completed 10% of the game.
[29:13.25]This is your breather.
[29:14.41]Every 50 rooms.
[29:21.50]I saved it, right?
[29:22.10]Yeah.
[29:23.95]This is gonna take you five hours.
[29:26.12]Why would it take you five hours?
[29:28.42]I just have to go into different halls and open doors 900 more times, so... There are only 60 minutes in an hour, so one room per minute.
[29:39.03]No, it's one... No, that's not how it works.
[29:43.89]Why would I spend one minute in each room?
[29:53.77]What happened to the little ghost person at the beginning?
[29:55.57]It was just like, hi, welcome to my castle, and then they've gone.
[30:05.65]New environment.
[30:13.58]It's beige now.

[32:26.35]Alright.
[32:26.75]And one of these is gonna be in the room.
[32:28.56]Okay.
[32:28.76]Not in this room.
[32:58.14]There's gonna be five different cat DOSes.
[33:04.76]Is this one of the cat DOSes?
[33:18.97]Bang!
[33:19.47]Up against the wall.
[33:23.93]Yep.
[33:24.31]No.
[33:24.71]Come on.
[33:25.05]Do it like sprint sprint sprint sprint.
[33:26.33]What's that in the distance?
[33:27.11]Sprint sprint sprinting sprinting sprinting sprinting and then wicked close!
[33:31.23]That's what I would have done.
[33:39.69]Who are these people?
[33:42.19]Hold on.
[33:42.57]Wait.
[33:42.77]Are these YouTubers that have been scared by the game?
[33:56.72]Alright.
[34:00.74]That's, that's so funny.
[34:03.28]Why am I not on that wall?
[34:04.63]I, because I've not, I haven't played this game.
[34:06.59]I, I had nothing to do with this game.
[34:09.55]What do you mean, you're next?
[34:17.68]No.
[34:18.56]I'm not.
[34:32.70]We are almost 11% of the way through this game.
[34:42.58]Green room.
[34:52.71]The music's getting louder.
[35:00.03]Green room two.
[35:02.82]Something coming up out of the water.
[35:04.08]No.
[35:04.82]Something coming up on the left side.
[35:10.54]Ah.
[35:16.06]Ah, it's gonna be here.
[35:17.52]It's gonna be in here.
[35:18.26]I mean, you don't have the fog.
[35:19.38]Well, oh, that was the door.
[35:24.76]I know what you're gonna do.
[35:25.98]Just do it already.
[35:28.64]Ding.
[35:31.63]Ding.
[35:34.43]What do you mean, ding?
[35:37.31]Ding, dunk.
[35:40.39]Dunk.
[35:42.68]Dunk.
[35:44.60]Ding!
[35:45.58]So it was right.
[35:46.86]Left.
[35:48.78]Right.
[35:50.68]Right.
[35:52.50]That's a double ding.
[35:53.70]Straight.
[35:56.22]Right.
[35:57.42]Right.
[35:58.59]Right.
[36:01.60]Right.
[36:01.86]Right.
[36:03.02]Ding.
[36:32.19]115.
[36:34.39]The music's getting loud.
[36:39.91]I thought they got rid of these because they were more effective.
[36:42.03]These are more effective than the monsters.
[36:45.05]Look at my reactions I had to the green I'm going to kill you monster versus the paper cutout that's like an emoji sticker.
[36:55.44]Not this time.
[36:56.60]I don't think that was wine.
[36:59.33]What was it?
[37:03.55]It's the test poison that you drink it and... I'm not gonna just use filler words and just use words just to talk, just be talking to distract myself from what's happening on the screen.
[37:14.72]I'm not going to do that.
[37:16.50]Because doing that would mean that I'm trying to fill air in my head to distract myself from the thing that's going to jump out in front of me in about 15 to 25 seconds, give or take, maybe a little bit there.
[37:28.78]Same thing.
[37:32.39]This is new.
[37:41.77]Needs a keycard.
[37:42.93]Oh, please.
[37:48.01]Uh-oh.
[37:56.58]I made this character in that wrestling game.
[37:58.50]That's the gum guy.
[37:59.32]They're gonna break out of these, probably, or something.
[38:04.64]Oh, geez.
[38:09.34]Yeah, something broke out.
[38:10.74]See?
[38:11.02]There's an empty one.
[38:15.16]Okay.
[38:16.08]PG YouTuber activated.
[38:20.00]Oh, crap.
[38:23.08]Oh, no.
[38:26.57]Oh.
[38:29.67]Oh, goodness.
[38:32.09]What the heck happened?
[38:34.09]Blood!
[38:39.27]Subject 5 is growing more and more restless.
[38:41.49]I told Spook we need more funds for sedatives.
[38:45.38]But she just laughed and flew into the ceiling.
[38:47.50]Without more chemicals to keep these things docile, I'm not sure how much longer we can keep them here.
[38:53.44]Got the keycard.
[38:54.98]Subject 5 is growing more and more restless.
[38:56.87]I told Spook we need more and more sedatives, okay?
[39:01.77]He does this joke every game. ...
[39:09.56]I gotta keep it going, you know what I mean?
[39:11.40]It's a tradition at this point.
[39:17.75]Look behind you in real life.
[39:25.75]Well, not every game.
[39:26.77]Only games where I have a facecam on.
[39:28.43]Alright, I'll give you that.
[39:29.89]If I have a facecam turned on, I'm going to do the YouTube person with 400 episodes.
[39:37.15]Yeah, that's what happens.
[39:38.87]You have to deal with it for like the two or three minutes that I do it, out of like 12 hours.
[39:42.95]Come on.
[39:57.06]I believe subject five is loose.
[39:59.86]The glass around its container is shattered and I can faintly hear clicking coming from the ceiling.
[40:04.64]I don't know what will happen now.
[40:05.82]If it's out and alive, then this is probably my last report.
[40:08.23]The clicking is getting louder now.
[40:14.77]It's behind me.
[40:18.39]I want to see what it looked like.
[40:19.43]Whoa, there's a bug!
[40:36.83]That was pretty funny.
[40:38.29]Alright, they come out of the clicker ceilings.
[40:40.37]He's fast.
[40:47.52]He just keeps breaking the doors.
[40:53.90]Oh, great.
[41:01.64]Oh, great.
[41:02.23]Oh, great.
[41:03.23]Oh, great.
[41:04.95]Oh, no.
[41:07.49]Oh, crap!
[41:08.63]There's like a hundred of them!
[41:12.97]Oh, no!
[41:17.56]Oh, jeez!
[41:20.14]Oh, crap!
[41:38.10]I do that every fucking stream too.
[41:46.46]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[41:50.70]I know what's behind me, just don't even look at it.
[41:52.22]This is a good way to burn through rooms though.
[42:02.35]It's the same exact room.
[42:05.01]You, you do too early.
[42:06.29]You missed your cue.
[42:22.01]150, 150, 150.
[42:22.09]So I can stop this mute.
[42:26.37]Great.
[42:26.87]One of these.
[42:29.48]Is he here still?
[42:32.34]Get the gunk out of your ears.
[42:36.48]What, implying that I didn't hear you say something?
[42:40.12]That's what you say to somebody that's not listening to you.
[42:44.35]You're talking to somebody, and they're not paying attention.
[42:47.15]Hey, what time is the bus?
[42:48.21]What time are we getting on the bus?
[42:50.77]Hey, get the gunk out of your ears!
[42:52.24]And they're like, whoa, what the heck?
[42:55.08]What are you talking about?
[42:56.74]I have really dry lips.
[43:09.70]Will you pay attention to the game, please?
[43:21.93]Saved it.
[43:24.26]Hang in there.
[43:24.88]We're only at 15%.
[43:25.58]What do you want me to click while I have a second here?
[43:29.10]Look at the link.
[43:29.82]Click this link.
[43:34.13]That's pretty... Okay, that's pretty funny.
[44:13.18]But I wasn't playing a scary game there.
[44:15.37]150, let's go.
[44:21.66]That wasn't me playing a scary game.
[44:24.78]That was me putting tape all over my body.
[44:27.99]Without a scary game.
[44:37.16]Get scared or riot.
[44:39.94]Chop till you drop axe.
[44:46.31]What was the image?
[44:46.99]I missed it.
[44:50.75]Well, you missed it.
[44:52.15]Sorry.
[44:52.53]Alright, let's go.
[45:03.08]I'm speedrunning my way to one foot two hundred.
[45:06.50]Now this is different.
[45:12.18]It's not that bad.
[45:13.72]It's not that bad.
[45:14.71]I'll do it.
[45:15.25]I'll get to a thousand.
[45:16.07]They're gonna introduce more monsters that are gonna be in there.
[45:20.19]There'll be one in the ceiling.
[45:21.41]There'll be one in the rafters.
[45:23.41]There'll be one coming out of the wall.
[45:35.24]Oh, shit.
[45:36.30]What the hell is this?
[45:37.78]He's still behind me, isn't he?
[45:42.62]You take 160 floors to introduce the flashlight mechanic.
[45:50.53]Oh, shit.
[45:51.25]This is like a classroom read.
[45:53.59]Read the notes.
[46:00.80]Something's gonna be at a desk.
[46:02.76]I can't get out of here.
[46:03.46]Something's gonna be at a desk?
[46:08.45]What is in the desk?
[46:09.45]A key card.
[46:10.79]Something.
[46:14.83]There's nothing in here.
[46:24.24]I just rewound a YouTube video.
[46:31.02]I didn't want to miss my favorite part.
[46:37.54]Okay, there's a note here.
[46:41.10]Matsuri never came to class today.
[46:43.36]Oh, she made it home.
[46:44.13]Okay.
[46:52.81]Hey!
[46:53.13]What, Harry?
[46:53.65]What?
[46:53.89]I looked at a picture of a cat and it hurt me.
[46:58.47]That's great.
[46:59.77]Cool.
[47:12.33]Could it really be true?
[47:13.31]I thought the fairy tales about the ghost that eats children who sneak in after class was just to keep us from disobeying.
[47:19.41]But Matsuri is still missing.
[47:28.82]Where's the key to get out of here?
[47:36.70]I'm lost.
[47:37.16]There's a shadow over there.
[47:39.80]Somebody in the corner.
[47:40.58]I see them.
[47:41.37]Is that me?
[47:45.31]What?
[47:47.73]That just hurt me.
[48:06.65]Okay, I need to get some logical reasoning here.
[48:09.99]Which way am I going?
[48:12.48]This is back towards the front.
[48:14.46]So it's here, and then bang a left.
[48:15.74]Then bang a right, out the door.
[48:21.24]Thank you.
[48:21.64]Shit.
[48:28.06]Alright, okay.
[48:32.72]Alright, okay.
[48:34.71]Alright.
[48:37.01]Alright.
[48:40.31]Alright.
[48:44.13]Alright.
[48:47.43]Alright.
[48:55.80]Oh, Undertale!
[48:56.74]Oh shit, it's actually flying at me.
[49:21.95]Where are you, man?
[49:22.79]Are you Q?
[49:24.21]You missed your Q again.
[49:33.91]Shut up.
[49:37.46]Thank you.
[49:56.65]This music's too happy!
[49:58.21]I don't know how much longer I can go on.
[50:10.12]I haven't seen any of my previous notes.
[50:12.42]That means either I'm getting somewhere, or someone is taking them.
[50:23.69]Blood?
[50:25.23]No.
[50:30.09]Chair.
[50:30.95]Don't go chair route.
[50:32.13]I've already got this taken care of.
[50:33.85]This way.
[50:47.39]Damn it.
[50:47.77]Wait, no.
[50:49.54]Nothing.
[50:53.34]You got it taken chair of.
[50:58.43]I wish I came up with that, but I didn't.
[51:01.35]Nice work.
[51:07.47]I hear breathing.
[51:09.88]We're not even at floor 200.
[51:11.20]You fucking idiot.
[51:18.14]I think this...
[51:21.86]I think this is my last note.
[51:23.00]I'm going to die having never found my escape.
[51:25.82]But really, that's not true.
[51:27.00]This place was like my escape.
[51:28.34]My escape from everything else.
[51:29.58]In the end, my death is kind of romantic.
[51:37.72]This romantic thing has really got you all twisted.
[51:57.40]This is a live stream.
[51:59.16]No, I can re-chat for a second.
[52:02.00]What's up?
[52:02.34]This is romantic.
[52:03.24]How's that iced coffee?
[52:04.81]Oh, it's not iced coffee.
[52:05.83]This is water that I sprayed a little bit of lemon juice in.
[52:11.33]This is just to stay hydrated.
[52:13.23]Bugs.
[52:21.85]It is water.
[52:22.51]Uh-oh.
[52:25.84]Don't get this wrong.
[52:28.95]Okay, chair.
[52:31.98]Which is the right- I didn't see it.
[52:37.80]I'm fucking going as fast as I can!
[52:39.70]Get outta here!
[52:40.46]Yeah, I know we're both playing Gmod Deathrun and I'm going too slow for you, but fuck off!
[52:48.07]I'm trying to enjoy the game!
[53:01.42]Nice.
[53:09.79]I almost hit 200.
[53:18.73]200.
[53:19.41]What is that?
[53:20.37]This thing's looking at me.
[53:24.59]I'm not going to say it.
[53:26.60]No, I'm not going to say it.
[53:27.68]Somebody else did.
[53:29.22]I refuse to say it.
[53:31.89]Alright, so how's everybody doing?
[53:33.15]How's your day?
[53:40.00]Make your face cam bigger.
[53:42.72]That's not necessary.
[54:04.22]There you go.
[54:08.92]There you go.
[54:09.82]400.
[54:14.03]Make it bigger.
[54:14.57]No, that's as big as it's gonna get.
[54:39.10]204.
[54:39.36]Yeah.
[54:48.74]Any chance I can get to throw that in.
[54:51.48]You better believe I'm going.
[54:52.76]Uh oh, this is like Slender Man graphic on me.
[54:58.34]Why do I have like this slender static?
[55:08.66]What?
[55:10.78]This was such a surprise.
[55:38.77]Is that code for how I have to- AHHHHH!
[55:49.76]My fucking jaw hurts.
[55:51.10]So that's what that means.
[55:57.22]Okay.
[55:58.58]That- It took 208 rooms.
[56:01.75]That was a real one for me.
[56:07.48]It took 200 rooms to have that be a full-on... Like, I was not ready for that one.
[56:17.04]Jump scare mansion.
[56:20.06]Oh, fuck.
[56:21.42]Don't even... Ugh.
[56:24.50]Broken.
[56:29.34]Broken.
[56:30.52]Broken.
[56:36.95]Okay.
[56:38.18]What's this?
[56:38.68]Hey.
[56:39.92]The darkness is slowly consuming us now.
[56:42.14]I don't think our rituals will appease it much longer.
[56:45.64]How were we supposed to know this would happen?
[56:57.32]Ah, shit.
[56:59.07]Ah, shit.
[57:01.43]It's not really our fault.
[57:02.71]We just did what Mother has told us to do in this sort of situation.
[57:22.48]Mother is not pleased with us, but how were we supposed to know that that girl wasn't pure?
[57:28.79]He's reading lore in the game.
[57:38.59]Yeah, I kinda wanna know what's going on.
[57:41.44]It's not really our fault we did what Mother told us to do.
[57:45.90]This is probably...
[57:50.43]One of these is gonna have somebody in it.
[57:52.75]The girl wasn't pure.
[57:53.95]Ah, this is... That's where I came from.
[58:03.58]Alright, if I cross my eyes, like, it won't be scary, because I won't know what it is.
[58:06.53]Except that hurts.
[58:21.63]Did it work?
[58:22.33]Kinda works.
[58:36.43]Safety squinting.
[58:52.94]What the fuck is happening to you?
[58:59.13]Alright, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[59:00.63]Give me the 220.
[59:01.09]Two... There's somebody... There's something following me.
[59:04.33]I don't know what it is.
[59:04.97]I just want to see what it looks like.
[59:08.09]It's got a knife.
[59:13.05]Oh, when it sees you, it changes your environment.
[59:16.15]To be all fucky.
[59:19.73]Oh, no.
[59:20.93]This is not good.
[59:34.93]Get out of my way.
[59:36.17]You are meaningless to me now.
[59:45.07]Okay.
[59:46.13]I have to be honest.
[59:47.39]When I crossed my eyes like that for more than 10 seconds, I just... This hurts.
[59:51.91]My head hurts now.
[59:55.79]Oh, nice.
[59:56.23]Arcade games.
[59:57.77]How do you control it?
[60:09.75]It's gonna scream in my face.
[60:10.89]Oh, I'm here.
[60:14.99]Wait.
[60:16.93]I have to... I'm the ghost.
[60:23.28]Hey!
[60:23.50]That's not very nice.
[60:24.44]I can't believe Pac-Man's fucking dead.
[60:39.88]Wait, no, I'm the, oh, I'm the ghost.
[60:48.66]Where, what?
[60:50.47]Why am I doing this?
[60:51.37]I didn't even stab anybody.
[61:04.59]Automatic, uh, plus letter grade.
[61:07.99]Now, technically speaking, I am not driving the car.
[61:11.65]My character is.
[61:16.88]This is a pretty good song.
[61:21.64]I'll give it a half letter grade for that.
[61:33.89]Why are people just spinning around on the road?
[61:36.51]What?
[61:37.87]What do... Oh, I'm... okay.
[61:39.79]This is a big turn.
[61:44.29]Oh, I can run over stuff.
[61:46.53]This is a good song.
[62:03.27]Here comes a demon face, yeah.
[62:04.99]I know.
[62:07.97]I'm certain of it.
[62:09.85]That's why I'm getting ready.
[62:10.69]How do I win?
[62:34.41]Here's the sad part about this.
[62:35.83]This is a better game than any of the iPad GTA clones I played like five years ago.
[62:47.06]Do I have to just eliminate all the other cars?
[63:02.15]Alright, that's it.
[63:04.09]I win.
[63:06.68]I haven't, I didn't win.
[63:12.08]Checkpoint.
[63:17.78]Nitrous.
[63:18.18]How do I activate nitrous?
[63:22.38]Every time I destroy a car, my point, my time goes up.
[63:30.06]Just don't don't kill any don't stop killing anybody what There's nobody else here That was fun
[63:59.51]I can't leave the game.
[64:05.40]There's no exit.
[64:06.90]I can't walk this way.
[64:08.60]I'm driving the car backwards.
[64:10.28]I'm holding it like this.
[64:11.86]He's doing a Naruto run.
[64:26.32]Alright.
[64:27.14]15 seconds.
[64:31.34]Here it comes.
[64:33.08]It's gonna go... I just got an achievement.
[64:46.94]It says Metagamer.
[64:49.35]This one's out of order.
[64:53.27]Okay.
[64:54.63]Well, that was cool.
[65:03.39]Make your room darker.
[65:05.75]No, I can't make my room darker.
[65:07.26]It's the same reason why I can't go see a movie during the day.
[65:12.58]If I black out the curtains and I turn all the lights off, it's nighttime to me.
[65:19.36]I don't like going to see a movie during the day.
[65:21.27]When you go into this theater, it's like, oh, it's so dark in here.
[65:23.57]There's the big screen.
[65:24.97]And then you walk out and it's like...
[65:27.94]The sun is out, and I was just sitting in a pitch black room for like two and a half hours.
[65:34.63]No, I don't see movies during the day.
[65:44.79]A movie is like, after dinner, you go out to dinner, and then like a 7 to 9 p.m.
[65:50.13]showing is perfect.
[66:02.28]Now, there are scenarios where going to a movie during the day is not a bad idea, because sometimes you save money.
[66:07.76]You know, if you go to like a noon showing, sometimes the tickets are cheaper.
[66:11.51]Do they still do that?
[66:13.37]I've been to one movie in two years, or two movies in three years.
[66:16.59]Do they still do like $7 matinees?
[66:18.87]Okay, I'm just making sure.
[66:25.02]Well, there's something new.
[66:31.26]Is that supposed to be me?
[66:32.16]Like, my brain stuck in this simulation?
[66:54.72]Put furniture pads on your furniture, please, guys.
[66:57.28]Don't be like this fucking idiot here.
[67:00.20]Those floors are expensive.
[67:01.28]Don't ruin them.
[67:03.59]This place is finally starting to affect me.
[67:07.01]I've seen enough horror movies to know how to survive a simple ghost or two, but these monsters keep getting faster and stranger.
[67:12.81]Almost to 250.
[67:26.66]And I have not died yet.
[67:29.72]I swear, man, I have to do a cross-eyed thing.
[67:33.84]My, like, eyes hurt.
[67:36.25]My mother warned me so many times, don't do that.
[67:38.67]If you do it long enough, it's gonna stay like that.
[67:54.98]Oh, come on.
[67:55.56]Not this again.
[67:56.84]Left.
[67:57.18]Oh god.
[67:59.36]Left.
[68:00.54]Straight.
[68:02.77]Left.
[68:05.37]Left.
[68:06.39]Straight.
[68:07.65]Straight.
[68:11.05]Right.
[68:13.45]Done.
[68:16.02]If I was a puzzle designer, that's exactly what I would have done.
[68:18.76]For the second one.
[68:20.04]In fact, I would do straight, straight, straight, straight, straight.
[68:23.53]And then just really mess it all up.
[68:28.95]Uh-oh.
[68:36.95]That's the sound.
[68:41.65]I haven't seen anything major in a little while, so...
[68:46.24]Fan.
[68:47.16]Don't do it!
[68:50.55]Don't!
[68:51.05]Don't!
[68:52.37]Don't!
[68:52.77]Hello?
[68:53.15]Hello?
[68:53.59]Hello?
[68:53.75]No!
[68:53.85]Hello?
[68:54.45]Hello?
[68:57.53]Hello?
[68:57.65]Hello?
[68:57.77]No!
[68:57.87]Hello?
[68:58.13]Hello?
[68:58.35]Hello?
[68:58.49]Stop it!
[68:58.75]Stop doing that!
[69:20.60]Fucking Five Nights at Freddy's.
[69:31.34]What?
[69:34.04]Don't look directly... Don't look directly into the fan.
[69:37.87]Hello?
[69:47.18]Oh, it's your first day!
[69:48.12]Hello!
[69:49.68]Alright!
[69:53.48]I tried to look... I looked directly into that van.
[70:07.93]What just happened right there?
[70:08.83]I just... I had to do the hello.
[70:11.15]Hello, hello, hello!
[70:12.57]Hello!
[70:12.97]I'm doing it again.
[70:13.49]Whee!
[70:23.13]I just got, like, stuck.
[70:26.85]Fifty!
[70:27.83]Oh!
[70:28.47]Hello!
[70:32.50]Progress.
[70:53.96]Should I take... Should I take the gift... Should I take the gift from a third of all Twitter avatars?
[71:05.67]What do you think?
[71:06.33]I'm gonna save it first.
[71:54.61]That was funny.
[71:56.08]That was cute.
[71:58.90]I'm gonna retweet that.
[72:03.68]That was fun.
[72:04.62]Password is pumpkin.
[72:11.54]Pumpkin.
[72:13.41]For what?
[72:33.43]We're good.
[72:34.11]Oh, this is bad.
[73:06.41]Boy, now there's another thing.
[73:11.33]No, Jerma, you're bad.
[73:21.49]Oh shit, there's something else.
[73:26.29]Nice turtleneck.
[73:31.57]Right.
[73:36.08]It was wrong.
[73:37.10]It was wrong.
[73:38.30]It was wrong.
[73:41.71]It's alright.
[73:42.21]I made it with just a little scratch right after that.
[73:44.29]What?
[73:44.55]Oof.
[73:45.17]Oh, Mosquito's out tonight?
[73:46.24]What's going on here?
[74:07.83]Down.
[74:12.77]Jeremy.
[74:13.65]Jeremy, you're almost at 300.
[74:16.83]You idiot.
[74:18.29]That's a face I just made into the camera.
[74:31.22]Why was that one worse than anything?
[74:38.04]Come on, you're almost at 300.
[74:57.27]This music is just messing me up.
[74:59.55]It just feels like I don't want to hear this.
[75:03.91]I want Yoshi's Story OST to play in the background of my streams.
[75:11.48]Got it.
[75:34.62]Why is everyone talking about my neck?
[75:38.48]Leave me alone.
[75:39.18]What's wrong with my neck?
[75:40.18]I'm 34.
[75:40.28]I'm not like 20.
[75:42.30]You understand?
[75:43.70]This is what a real neck looks like.
[75:46.54]At 35.
[76:03.16]What do I care about what you guys have to say?
[76:05.00]I'm almost at 300.
[76:05.48]He's 35 and he still gets voice cracks.
[76:33.68]That doesn't even bother me.
[76:39.39]Yeah, guess what?
[76:40.19]My teacher.
[76:40.85]I had teachers in high school that their voice would crack.
[76:45.09]Because they were speaking continuously for like six hours.
[76:48.87]And at hour number five, they'd be like, Sorry guys, I'm a teacher.
[76:56.36]That's Cope.
[77:03.62]I'm giving you guys way too many, like, screenshots.
[77:11.23]Sometimes I forget that, like, you can just rewind five seconds and stop at a single frame and press a button.
[77:33.66]Just gotta go faster than chair... not chair route.
[77:50.23]This is making me sick.
[77:53.42]Did he fall off?
[77:56.84]I think he fell off the edge.
[77:58.44]Oh, no he didn't.
[77:59.76]His powers stopped.
[78:07.20]Uh-oh.
[78:07.62]Uh-oh.
[78:10.24]Uh-oh.
[78:12.16]Uh-oh.
[78:15.89]Uh-oh.
[78:38.01]Three.
[78:43.71]Hundred.
[78:46.65]Anything I need to know?
[78:50.59]Anything I need to know?
[78:51.75]Anyone just saying anything?
[78:53.25]Something I need to know?
[79:02.32]You're doing good.
[79:04.26]Thanks.
[79:13.75]There's somebody behind you.
[79:14.69]No, there's not.
[79:15.43]I mean, it was that.
[79:18.55]Better ingredients, better pasta.
[79:19.67]That's the power of Home Depot.
[79:23.56]Papa John's thing.
[79:26.24]That's Papa John's.
[79:29.40]I don't like that pizza.
[79:40.18]Is that so wrong to say I don't like that pizza?
[79:51.94]Am I a religious man?
[79:55.32]Um, not really.
[80:14.56]He's a... He's Mormon.
[80:17.58]Where are you getting the idea that I'm Mormon?
[80:22.30]Yeah.
[80:25.13]Oh, shit.
[80:25.83]Okay, this is where it gets real at 300.
[80:45.83]This is a good game to stream.
[80:49.00]Yeah, I'm having a good time.
[80:52.12]As much as you can have a good time just having things yell at you every so often.
[80:56.34]That's been a minute or two.
[81:17.30]Oh.
[81:20.74]This reminds me of Dreadhalls.
[81:36.83]So I can only go in these two.
[81:40.67]Nice.
[81:42.21]Sick.
[81:43.53]Sick Windows 95 adventure game music.
[81:47.23]Blast it!
[81:52.27]It's perfect!
[81:57.59]Now, bring back the, like, the dunks and... Here we go.
[82:07.96]Magist!
[82:08.72]Am I reading this out of order?
[82:13.05]One day a strange merchant came to town.
[82:14.83]He sold handmade puppets and trinkets, and all the children loved his store and his gifts.
[82:19.15]But the town couldn't support his store because the other shops were failing.
[82:24.84]The other shopkeepers became jealous, so one night some of the townspeople took all his puppets and threw them in the river.
[82:36.28]But just afterwards, he came running to the river crying and wailing that his children were being drowned.
[82:42.27]He dove into the river trying to save his possessions.
[82:44.83]The townspeople, bitter and still angry, watched him frantically thrash and dive into the river until he never came back to the surface of the water.
[83:00.06]That's a huge key.
[83:03.50]I thought the key was a pair of scissors.
[83:18.20]That's where I came from.
[83:23.25]Use the key.
[83:33.41]How many stars do I have?
[83:46.54]That was slow to get up.
[84:00.68]Somebody in here.
[84:06.31]Although not what they wanted, the shopkeepers were satisfied.
[84:12.37]Years later, the children of the town began to go missing.
[84:15.31]And as more and more children disappeared, people began to find more and more puppets in the forest and around the river.
[84:20.82]These puppets seemed almost to look like the missing children sometimes.
[84:32.61]Fuck.
[84:33.51]Is this serious?
[84:43.69]Open door.
[84:49.17]This door looks different than all the others.
[84:51.67]Why?
[84:59.49]Okay.
[85:00.29]This, uh...
[85:04.39]Alright, so it teleports.
[85:10.15]Hey!
[85:11.05]I'm dead.
[85:14.09]I'm dead.
[85:14.65]I'm gonna die.
[85:18.82]Ugh!
[85:35.43]Oh, I have energy!
[85:38.15]No!
[85:40.21]No!
[86:07.03]No, I can't do I shit.
[86:08.31]I can't do I shit.
[86:09.75]I can't, I can't, I can't do I shit.
[86:15.45]Become a puppet to rid oneself of the pain and harshness of choice.
[86:18.55]Now nothing you do is your fault.
[86:20.15]Now you belong to something you belong to me.
[86:24.45]Game over.
[86:25.91]Your soul wanders an endless maze.
[86:43.23]I think I just heard my dog bark.
[86:46.07]Hold on.
[86:47.70]I think he's like, maybe he wants to go in a room or something.
[86:50.84]Give me one second.
[86:53.27]He's like, hey, come get me.
[87:33.75]Thank you.
[87:59.11]you
[88:44.30]I don't know.
[88:51.58]He just kind of was... He's eaten.
[88:53.37]He ate today.
[88:54.01]He's gone out today.
[88:54.75]I think he was just annoyed with me that I wasn't playing with him.
[89:01.36]He was just like, what are you doing?
[89:03.31]I was like, why are you in there?
[89:05.47]So I said hello, and we'll see what he does.
[89:14.64]Play with him, I just did, I played with him with a toy.
[89:16.76]And I gave him a snack, so he's good.
[89:32.28]Cho-Otto.
[89:34.44]On my next BRB.
[89:36.12]Because he's awake.
[89:38.16]When I leave, I'll go bring him in here.
[89:41.26]You can say hello.
[89:44.12]No, not now.
[89:44.94]Not right now.
[89:47.28]In a little bit.
[89:50.77]Alright, so this guy... I have to run as fast as I can.
[90:06.12]Here we go.
[90:07.60]I have to do this dumb stuff again.
[90:09.52]Get the key and open the door and... 305... 306... 307... 308... 3...
[90:35.68]This is not the same.
[90:37.04]This is different.
[90:42.57]Wait, why is this different?
[90:49.49]There's another cat DOS.
[91:00.65]Disregard it?
[91:01.47]Disregard it.
[91:02.47]So, it's... Okay, I get it.
[91:29.34]I don't know what that is, like a painting.
[91:31.80]The specimen is a constantly changing form and attributes depending on subject's personality.
[91:39.87]The most common form resembles a wall of moving anatomy symbols.
[91:44.15]Only effective on subjects with past trauma or a history of psychological issues.
[91:48.02]Okay.
[91:53.93]Floating figure that appeared in a test chamber a few years after it was filled with what was believed to just be unusually violent deer.
[92:01.75]The specimen seems to engulf subjects and absorb them into its torso region.
[92:05.29]Proved extremely effective on violent subjects.
[92:07.93]So don't attack this one.
[92:12.35]Alright.
[92:14.31]Okay.
[92:20.58]Exit program.
[92:21.68]Let's go.
[92:26.69]Here it is.
[92:27.39]Gil, get the key.
[92:33.01]The puppets.
[92:34.19]Watch out for the puppets.
[92:36.77]This person used... This person was a puppet.
[92:40.19]They are now.
[92:40.85]They used to be a person, but now they're a puppet.
[92:44.27]Watch out.
[92:46.11]And look at them, because he's... He gives reactions to people that do not care about them.
[93:03.39]What the hell did I just do?
[93:14.43]Key.
[93:16.39]Alright, let's try this again.
[93:26.26]Can I level up my stamina bar?
[93:29.87]Alright, so he gets mad if you don't pay attention to him.
[93:33.19]Whoa!
[93:58.38]His eyes just got angry.
[93:59.64]Oh, fuck.
[94:02.84]He's angry.
[94:04.42]That's actually pretty scary.
[94:10.78]What?
[94:11.10]Where?
[94:11.28]Where?
[94:11.52]Where?
[94:11.78]Where?
[94:12.02]Where?
[94:12.24]Where?
[94:12.48]Where?
[94:12.62]Where?
[94:12.82]Ugh.
[94:13.12]Ugh.
[94:31.55]Where?
[94:32.27]Where is he?
[94:38.63]I hate that face.
[94:51.05]It's fucking horrifying.
[94:52.17]Don't go the chair route.
[94:55.44]I did it.
[94:55.74]He's gone.
[94:57.02]Nice.
[95:03.89]He's not still here, right?
[95:15.04]No.
[95:15.28]Okay.
[95:19.47]On to 350.
[95:36.86]Is he in this brain room again?
[95:47.10]That dude's coming back.
[95:50.08]That dude's coming back.
[95:51.98]I'm certain of it.
[95:55.40]He's gonna just appear in front of me and I'm gonna have to run away and turn around or something.
[95:59.06]Yep!
[95:59.50]I knew it!
[96:00.12]I knew it!
[96:00.56]Oh, it's this lady.
[96:04.61]Okay.
[96:13.18]She's right behind me.
[96:24.57]So what happens if she touches you?
[96:36.61]You instantly die.
[96:45.86]Find out.
[96:50.62]I'm not gonna find out.
[96:51.50]Because I looked over at chat.
[96:56.57]I thought, I don't know, I thought that was like one of you guys coming at me.
[97:05.39]Okay.
[97:07.65]Oh well.
[97:10.44]Where's my checkpoint?
[97:13.50]Oh, that's not good.
[97:14.52]You get a checkpoint every... hundred... now.
[97:20.46]Of course.
[97:21.34]Why would it be any... video games?
[97:26.36]I've played these already.
[97:41.19]Jeremy, could you please keep it down?
[97:42.29]I've had a horrible cold the last few days.
[97:44.47]I need to rest.
[97:45.21]Go take a bath.
[97:53.92]What are you doing here?
[98:08.02]Go season your bathtub with Epsom salt.
[98:13.41]And make it hot enough where it's- it's a- Oh, fucking come on.
[98:54.08]It's silent now.
[99:04.32]I figured it out.
[99:05.14]Watch this.
[99:20.95]How do I get out of here?
[99:26.38]You gotta do a backwards long jump.
[99:31.08]Yeah, what about when I'm thinking I have to go... ...and fly through the fucking wall?
[99:33.66]Alright, pay attention.
[99:57.25]The bed's just on the wall now.
[99:58.71]What does that mean?
[100:23.62]That actually just scared me.
[100:25.82]That was like a scary thing.
[100:27.92]Oh well.
[100:29.70]Stop!
[100:52.32]Just like, sticking your beds on the wall.
[100:55.57]Who's that?
[100:57.39]Sick.
[101:21.20]It's back!
[101:21.84]He's back!
[101:22.26]He's back!
[101:24.12]Oh fuck!
[101:24.58]Which way is it?
[101:25.10]Is it left or right?
[101:40.42]This guy... I hate this guy.
[101:41.82]He's fucking horrible.
[101:42.78]I have to go left.
[101:47.71]It's a goddamn chair route!
[101:54.40]Don't die, please don't die here.
[101:56.40]Fuck.
[102:12.03]You motherfucker.
[102:14.13]You motherfucker.
[102:15.87]You motherfucker, get away from me.
[102:25.31]Oh my god!
[102:52.58]Oh my god.
[102:53.30]How many more rooms of this is it?
[102:56.76]Oh shit.
[102:59.01]God.
[103:20.86]That guy's scary.
[103:22.60]It's his face.
[103:23.24]When that guy gets close to you, he does that face.
[103:32.39]And it's just horrible.
[103:39.23]Left.
[103:42.00]Don't die now.
[103:42.76]I won't, I won't.
[103:43.52]I'm not gonna die now.
[103:45.08]I'll be alright.
[103:47.86]Chair.
[103:55.48]He's close though.
[103:59.45]Bright this time.
[104:00.11]Bright this time.
[104:24.03]Another one of these.
[104:24.84]Why?
[104:26.26]There you go.
[104:31.42]Okay.
[104:33.30]Always left.
[104:37.19]It's left every time.
[104:39.25]Except I did left before, and it wasn't during the puppet guy.
[104:42.55]Okay.
[105:08.52]400.
[105:08.56]Bingo.
[105:09.96]We got it.
[105:11.16]Yes.
[105:12.24]Yes.
[105:18.69]Keep that blood pumping.
[105:19.85]GL Labs.
[105:24.57]40%.
[105:24.61]Pretty cool.
[105:32.01]Anything else?
[105:32.43]Anything I need to know?
[105:45.69]There's an image of what suit it is.
[105:55.52]I'll tell you, I got a nice clean tongue.
[106:00.18]Otto.
[106:00.74]No, I'm not going to get Otto right now.
[106:03.66]I'm going to get Otto at my break.
[106:05.46]I'm not going to go get Otto.
[106:07.92]He's doing just fine.
[106:09.06]I'll get him at my next break.
[106:11.96]And then he's probably going to just hang out in here for a minute.
[106:14.85]I don't want Otto in here, by the way, because, oh, yeah, let me put my dog in the room.
[106:20.23]And, oh, hey, there's a little bed for you right here.
[106:23.61]And every 45 seconds, he's going to be like, what the?
[106:30.11]I don't want to do that.
[106:32.07]I'm just scaring him.
[106:41.74]He scared me.
[106:42.42]Yeah, and imagine if you were a dog that was like sleeping over here, lying down.
[106:47.18]Imagine if you were sleeping and you heard that.
[106:50.33]Alright, I gotta pay attention.
[106:55.95]It's the brain again.
[107:05.54]Scalp is itchy again.
[107:08.44]It just happened sometimes.
[107:10.12]I thought they got rid of you.
[107:11.32]I thought they got rid of you things.
[107:12.94]I thought you didn't do that anymore.
[107:14.34]I don't think they did that anymore after floor 300.
[107:16.49]Why are some of these doors locked?
[107:45.13]Threshold of consciousness.
[108:10.32]Oh, it's a cat!
[108:11.70]That's all it was.
[108:17.39]Well, hello there.
[108:18.63]Are you lost, little one?
[108:20.81]This place can help those who are ready, but expect turmoil more than you are used to.
[108:44.73]This is like a test of endurance.
[108:47.98]This game is a test of endurance.
[108:50.95]To see if you can get to floor 1000.
[108:52.23]Oh, I just was over there.
[109:07.51]Don't touch the... Two sides of the same coin.
[109:13.03]Knowing your projections can help you achieve great results.
[109:17.73]I have to pick a side.
[109:19.65]Strawberry or vanilla?
[109:21.51]Oh, this is tough.
[109:25.02]Strawberry.
[109:32.84]Strawberry ice cream is... Wait, this is important.
[109:36.81]Strawberry ice cream is terrible if it has strawberry chunks in it.
[109:41.84]But if it's a smooth strawberry ice cream, no bullshit, just smooth strawberry flavor, that's the best ice cream you can possibly buy.
[109:49.83]That's just a regular ice cream.
[109:51.83]Vanilla, on the other hand, this looks like vanilla bean.
[109:56.27]Okay, so we have smooth strawberry ice cream and vanilla bean ice cream.
[110:03.50]That makes this a lot harder, because vanilla bean ice cream is way better.
[110:10.28]I think I would still want the strawberry, the smooth strawberry.
[110:12.28]No, I'm staying with the smooth strawberry ice cream.
[110:14.52]How do I say yes?
[110:18.72]I don't think it says anything.
[110:37.22]Does that floor look smooth to you?
[110:38.56]It's pixelated!
[110:42.47]This floor's pixelated, too.
[110:43.85]Should I touch all this stuff?
[110:49.71]Alright, well, whatever.
[110:51.41]I chose. ...
[111:10.96]Mint chocolate?
[111:11.72]No.
[111:12.84]Pistachio.
[111:13.70]Without pistachios.
[111:18.10]One of the best ice creams is pistachio ice cream, but without... I just spit them out.
[111:23.67]See, me and Kim, we do this thing where when I get pistachio ice cream, I just eat the ice cream, and then I spit out the pistachios, and then she eats them.
[111:40.23]That's not weird!
[111:41.13]I eat, well, look, let me tell you, I eat around the pistachios, and then like, they just, I just don't eat them.
[111:49.62]I will save big chunks of ice cream with pistachios in them, and I make a little corner that's like, that's for Kim, because she likes, she loves pistachios.
[111:58.88]So I make, there's like 12 pistachios just sitting in the corner with like ice cream around them, and she just eats them.
[112:04.64]I don't like spit, I mean, I don't like spit them out.
[112:10.56]Missed your cue.
[112:14.45]That's disgusting.
[112:16.03]Yeah, just... The mask you wear serves its purpose well.
[112:23.93]But be careful not to lose yourself in it.
[112:35.94]Telephones are ringing.
[112:37.58]Telephones are ringing.
[112:39.88]Ah!
[112:40.98]Become... Follow the group.
[112:44.00]Become more than yourself.
[112:47.44]Be who you are.
[112:48.08]Follow the group.
[112:58.09]That's what it says!
[112:59.79]Be who you are to others.
[113:02.53]Oh, that's not a three.
[113:04.17]I thought it was like a three.
[113:07.02]How did I see that differently?
[113:09.60]I saw 3E.
[113:12.44]It was fucked up.
[113:15.35]No, it was fucked up.
[113:16.15]See how the background's changing?
[113:17.55]Behind this sometimes?
[113:19.33]It actually... Clip it and look at it.
[113:20.90]You'll see what I'm talking about.
[113:21.86]Trust me.
[113:26.40]But also, butter pecan ice cream falls in this category as well.
[113:31.20]Butter pecan ice cream is absolutely delicious.
[113:34.69]But get those pecans out of there.
[113:36.53]The actual butter pecan flavored ice cream is incredible.
[113:41.81]I just want to buy just the ice cream.
[113:45.96]Why is that so strange?
[113:50.14]And then they decided they were going to come up with something called Butter Crunch.
[113:53.96]And it's that butter pecan ice cream
[113:56.84]What's happening?
[114:03.01]It's the bugs, okay.
[114:06.55]Uh, butter pecan ice cream turned into butter crunch, and then they turned the pecans, instead of pecans, it's now these chunky, crunchy, buttery, tasty, sweet things.
[114:17.39]And that's alright, that's a step in the right direction, but you need to go full-blown, only butter-flavored ice cream, the butter pecan-flavored ice cream.
[114:40.46]Balance is the key to keeping your mind free and sane.
[114:54.65]Right.
[114:58.55]That's blood.
[115:04.15]Knowing your shadow can greatly help you, but be ready to see what you'd rather not be.
[115:11.77]Knowing your shadow.
[115:14.03]Watch out for your shadow.
[115:35.64]It was scary until you added the Mario sounds.
[115:40.79]What is that?
[115:41.99]What the fuck is that?
[115:43.36]What was... What is that?
[115:45.00]What's that thing?
[115:45.58]What do I do about the... Oh, it's the wall guy.
[115:48.34]It's the wall guy.
[115:49.14]And now the Indiana Jones river is flying over here.
[116:00.87]What do I do about the wall person?
[116:03.21]Do I step... I don't know.
[116:05.97]I don't know.
[116:06.59]I don't know.
[116:07.25]What do I do about the wall?
[116:09.01]I just heard auto again.
[116:10.15]Alright, hold on.
[116:10.71]I have to like...
[116:18.72]Let me go try to, like, see if he wants to go out.
[116:21.88]I'm gonna take, like, a few minute break here.
[116:32.55]Oh, shit.
[116:33.23]Uh-oh.
[116:42.82]Is this, like, a countdown?
[116:46.81]Okay.
[116:47.13]Alright.
[116:47.37]Alright.
[116:47.73]Alright.
[116:48.53]I've got to go see.
[116:49.58]I've got to go take Otto out.
[116:53.12]I'll be right back.
[116:54.08]Again, sorry.
[116:56.26]I need to see what Otto needs.
[116:58.61]I don't know.
[117:00.03]I don't think he's hungry.
[117:01.33]I think he's been fed.
[117:02.27]Alright.
[117:02.95]I'll be right back.
[117:04.19]Let me see what's going on.
[119:06.63]Thank you.

[122:48.35]Okay, I'm returned.
[122:52.00]He had to take a big dump.
[122:54.46]That's what happened.
[122:55.55]And he didn't want to come upstairs with me.
[123:04.77]He was like running around he didn't he took he did with that thing When he took a big dog poop and he was just so happy to have taken that dog poop That he was just like everything is right now.
[123:16.80]He's just sprinting around He didn't want to come up here You'll see him today
[123:31.58]Later.
[123:32.66]Not the- I don't want- I- that's not- I don't want to bring him up here during the scream game.
[123:40.13]Cause what- Cause once I bring him up here, you know, he's in the room and he's hanging out and he's like, it's alright, alright, now you're out of here.
[123:47.38]It's like, what I- you just brought me in here to hang out with you.
[123:50.04]It's alright, I don't want to scream and have you hear my screaming while you're trying to sleep.

[124:02.40]Yeah, no, you'll see him.
[124:04.12]You'll see him later.
[124:05.98]You will see Otto on this stream, or I'll do a 24-hour stream. ...
[124:17.29]By the time this string turns off, you will see auto.
[124:19.55]Alright, that was left.
[124:20.43]Left.

[130:42.97]You only go forward.
[130:46.52]Can you fall off the edge?
[130:48.12]I don't want to test that.
[130:51.16]I'm so glad nothing's following me.
[131:01.65]Table ending.

[132:26.21]So this one's out of order, and this one's not out of order.
[132:29.29]I mean, you go to the one that's out of order.
[132:38.75]Never mind.
[132:45.73]Let's go.
[132:47.04]Halfway there.
[133:05.49]What?
[133:07.21]Why is this... 52.
[133:09.70]I don't know if this means anything, but I just got logged in and log- I got logged out and logged in on Steam.
[133:39.86]Safe.
[133:40.34]Corrupted.
[133:41.82]Room 53.
[133:42.22]No, this is scripted.
[133:47.62]This is scripted.
[133:53.86]This is scripted.
[133:54.42]I'm gonna get to, like, floor 100.
[133:55.31]And it's gonna be... It's gonna be, like... Oh!
[134:01.89]You made it!
[134:03.87]Why'd you go that way?
[134:05.79]No!
[134:06.53]Walk into this portal!
[134:07.65]The cat's gonna come back and I'm gonna go to, like, a portal and go to five, like, fifty.
[134:12.82]That's definitely how this is going to work.
[134:23.05]He's lost it.
[134:23.77]Yeah, this is a different room, too.
[134:45.14]Manga S. Can you only talk in the auto voice until you get to floor 100?
[134:49.48]Yeah. ...
[135:26.17]Error 002313B FB gel.
[135:29.19]Cannot release twice.
[135:30.66]Exit through express.
[135:31.44]I told you guys this was gonna happen.
[135:46.19]I told you guys this was gonna happen.
[135:49.35]This basically is just a teleporter.
[136:08.79]You didn't get to 100.
[136:09.51]I got to 100 five times.
[136:10.57]That's 500.
[136:11.31]You got to hear it.
[136:12.31]Good.
[136:12.53]Good.
[136:40.61]Bugs.
[136:42.27]Bugs.
[136:43.70]Bugs.
[136:47.44]Dude.
[136:48.66]Dude, bugs.
[136:49.91]Alright, fucking god.
[136:51.71]Open!
[137:16.77]I don't even... I don't... They just get me because they're just annoying.
[137:21.53]They just get in the way.
[137:22.93]And of course I have to react because I have to get out of the way.
[137:25.17]531.
[137:30.73]Alright, I can't fucking do that right now.
[137:43.78]I'm trying.
[137:45.48]Both my ears are blocked.
[137:46.64]I can't do anything.
[138:00.91]B-O-F-A.
[138:03.49]Yeah, that's Bank of fucking America.
[138:05.89]What about it?
[138:24.14]This is new music.
[138:24.90]What is that?
[138:28.78]I don't know what this new music means, but I have to move.
[138:32.24]Don't attack the one... I don't know.
[138:39.32]I don't know.
[138:39.68]I can hear it though.
[138:40.88]I don't know.
[138:42.57]I don't know.
[138:44.21]I don't know.
[138:46.19]I'm preparing for it, whatever it is.
[138:53.58]Okay, we're outside.
[138:55.16]There's a cabin.
[138:59.63]For a while, I thought I had really escaped this place, but despite the trees and flora, I think this is actually just another room.
[139:07.65]I did hope to find deer, so I might at least get to eat.
[139:11.60]They make some strange sounds, though.
[139:16.22]This is the deer enemy.
[139:19.44]Which, I was told, do not attack the deer enemy.
[139:28.02]Don't attack the enemy.
[139:30.42]What the fuck is wrong with you?
[139:38.69]I don't know what they are, but those are definitely not deer.
[139:40.77]No shit.
[139:42.83]I tried sneaking up on one the other day to kill for food, but it saw me as soon as I got close.
[139:48.25]I was barely able to get away from the thing.
[139:50.59]I've managed to board up most of them.
[139:53.71]Hopefully I can find another way out of here.
[139:57.60]Don't get near them.
[140:01.42]Do not go near them.
[140:16.92]I thought it said don't attack them.
[140:18.16]What?
[140:56.68]We're inside of a computer.
[141:00.61]They don't follow you into rooms, right?
[141:11.02]I hate this music.
[141:11.78]It's like an untuned piano underwater.
[141:36.05]What the fuck are you?
[141:36.89]Hi, what's happening?
[141:37.63]How are you?
[141:39.07]Who are you?
[141:40.33]Who are you?
[141:41.25]Who are you?
[141:42.97]Who is that person?
[141:56.90]Oh no, no, it's the person that runs in front of you!
[141:58.75]I don't know what that means.
[142:05.59]What does it say?
[142:06.55]Is it a Borg?
[142:07.35]Yeah, toast!
[142:50.21]It's the guy!
[142:51.63]It's the guy!
[142:56.46]Oh no!
[143:03.65]This one's the worst.
[143:04.37]This one's the worst.
[143:05.25]This, this spit on me.
[143:06.89]This spit all over my mouth!
[143:08.27]Is this blood?
[143:09.71]I can't tell.
[143:10.37]I have like a big spit wad on my mouth.
[143:14.11]You!
[143:14.49]I need to get some health.
[143:43.30]Your submission is forfeit to me.
[143:49.47]I will devour your flesh.
[143:55.53]That guy wasn't as scary as this guy.
[144:09.14]What?
[144:15.53]I need that heal.
[144:18.10]Let's go!
[144:58.19]You did it.
[144:58.55]You actually did it.
[144:59.39]You did it.
[144:59.75]Hello!
[145:01.39]You did it.
[145:02.07]You did the thing.
[145:03.03]You did it.
[145:03.61]You did it.
[145:04.29]I didn't do it.
[145:05.05]You did it.
[145:06.39]You actually did it.
[145:07.25]I knew it.
[145:09.16]Break the fan.
[145:10.44]Don't look in the fan.
[145:11.08]I've been...
[145:18.41]600.
[145:18.43]We're almost at 60% of the way through this.
[145:20.85]600.
[145:20.87]Aw, dude.
[145:24.19]Aw, pog, dude.
[145:35.33]Pog.
[145:53.67]Alright, this is Pillar.
[145:58.09]Make like a tree and die coming this fall.
[146:02.54]Interesting.
[146:24.86]I'm ready.
[146:26.80]I still have the axe, right?
[146:35.60]That comes with me.
[146:41.79]What about some of those never-ending hallways that I came across?
[147:02.67]Don't hurt them.
[147:04.27]Well, what are they doing?
[147:07.15]If a guy's running down a hallway with an axe, I don't think it's smart to jump out in front of them and yell.
[147:17.42]I would stay closed.
[147:19.86]I would not open.
[147:20.48]Especially if the person was, like, panicking.
[147:25.54]Oh shit.
[147:28.29]You don't want to startle the panicking guy with the axe.
[147:30.90]That's just, that seems like common sense.
[147:37.12]Uh-oh.
[147:39.94]Oh, this is not good.
[147:40.78]I don't know where I'm going.
[147:47.06]Oh, that doesn't work!
[148:03.91]This whole place is somehow even worse than the new GL Labs.
[148:07.07]Although it seems to have been constructed with a much larger budget than the new lab, nothing works quite right.
[148:12.94]I can see why it was abandoned so quickly.
[148:15.82]I wonder if there really is anything here worth salvaging.
[148:23.63]Reset.
[148:34.68]Power's back on.
[148:35.44]Can you go this way?
[148:43.14]This is loud.
[148:50.96]This is very loud.
[149:07.69]Anything to read?
[149:11.00]Make it louder.
[149:12.25]You don't want this to be louder.
[149:40.42]No, no, no, not this, not this, not this, not a vent.
[149:45.51]Not a vent.
[149:46.21]The easiest horror game environment is the vent.
[149:52.37]And it is the most effective.
[149:59.96]It's the goddamn vent.
[150:17.81]Spooky just said that there were things we needed to salvage from this place I'm starting to worry that a loose specimen may be included in the list of things for us to retrieve The power just shut off again.
[150:29.70]Is everything broken in here?
[150:31.06]What was that noise?
[151:02.01]I don't know what to do.
[151:02.88]I can't think while I feel strange.
[151:04.24]I'm hiding from that thing.
[151:05.98]I feel like something is growing on my skin.
[151:09.38]I can't seem to tear it off fast enough.
[151:11.16]I'm losing a lot of blood.
[151:14.95]That thing.
[151:20.23]Can I please go in a different room now?
[151:22.60]Oh.
[151:26.99]You have to keep it close.
[151:28.65]It becomes something else when it gets too far away.
[151:31.05]Something I can't outrun.
[151:37.08]I'll... I'll give it a try.
[151:38.98]I'm gonna give it a try.
[151:47.31]Stay close.
[151:47.85]Jesus, get over here!
[151:48.69]Stay near me.
[151:57.92]Oh, fuck, it hurts!
[152:01.22]What's wrong with me?
[152:01.90]Hey, it said keep the thing close!
[152:06.00]It's turned into another animal!
[152:07.36]Shit.
[152:26.68]jump scares always distance 242 what what does that mean okay so I need to keep it close I can't kill it so just back around
[152:54.95]Why am I wearing two headphones, you monster?
[152:57.79]Well, because if I have one headphone and I can't hear them come around corners, and it is a horror game and there is a facecam on, so I might as well really, really go for it. 604...
[153:31.38]That shit is... Keep it close.
[153:38.82]Here we are.
[153:39.30]607.
[153:39.32]608.
[153:39.34]What?
[153:42.39]609.
[153:42.41]Wait, what is that sound?
[153:44.83]I forget.
[154:00.11]alright alright so just keep it close just back away turn off my lights in my room no I'm not going to the movies I'm not going to the movies during the day
[154:43.24]Lights off, you're a coward.
[154:45.50]No, I don't use lights off during the day.
[154:50.03]Okay, here we go.
[154:54.13]This is all just for show, nothing happens in here.
[155:07.85]Okay, stay close.
[155:10.79]But not too close.
[155:19.15]Right?
[155:22.03]Yes.
[155:22.95]This is it.
[155:39.65]I- Where's the fucking door?
[155:50.80]Follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me.
[155:54.00]Follow me.
[155:54.62]Come on, let's go.
[155:57.74]Hi!
[156:05.17]Where's the door?
[156:21.40]Where's the door?
[156:22.32]Right here.
[156:39.03]I want you to look at me.
[156:41.83]Look at me.
[156:50.56]What's my range?
[156:51.22]I'm not very good.
[156:52.66]I wonder what happens if I sprint around in a circle, but I don't want to lose.
[157:14.03]I want to find out.
[157:20.42]Is he getting faster?
[157:27.95]Come on.
[157:28.77]Come here.
[157:33.25]How long is this gonna go on for?
[157:36.40]Still following me.
[158:05.20]Oh, this guy sucks.
[158:17.75]How far is too far, I wonder?
[158:24.23]Watch the door.
[158:24.87]Yeah, you're doing an escort mission.
[158:27.45]Yeah, that's what it feels like.
[158:34.02]Alright, the scare factor on this dude is gone.
[158:48.80]Now you're just kinda sad.
[158:58.10]The fuck was that?
[159:01.40]He's gone.
[159:06.02]Alright.
[159:10.00]What was that?
[159:14.63]You are here.
[159:15.37]622.
[159:17.85]Who is it?
[159:21.55]What is that?
[159:24.05]It's you again.
[159:31.65]I thought we were done with this.
[159:37.15]Not for another 20 rooms, apparently.
[159:45.07]Just ditch him.
[159:54.20]Just ditch him.
[159:57.16]But it's said that if I go too far away, he'll turn into something that it's impossible for me to run away from.
[160:09.83]No, I'm not doing it.
[160:10.67]Just have to wait for you.
[160:21.80]No, I'm not gonna ditch him.
[160:25.02]I don't even know where the hell I'm going though.
[160:32.51]How far is too far though, I wonder?
[160:40.65]Let him grab your butt.
[160:46.46]No.
[160:53.34]Do it!
[160:55.79]I'm not gonna do that, but what if he kills you instantly?
[161:13.86]going this way.
[161:19.71]It's gonna be a pop-up thing.
[161:28.07]Come on.
[161:29.42]You're slowing me down.
[161:30.64]I did so many rooms so fast.
[161:33.60]Now I have to do it like this.
[161:35.78]Let's go.
[161:55.73]Needed a few extra punches there, getting tired.
[162:01.09]Snorlax, whatever his name is.
[162:03.58]What the fuck am I doing?
[162:15.06]No, I guess that makes sense.
[162:18.12]What I was trying to... What's the thing from Star Wars that eats the people?
[162:22.44]It's like the big thing, and it looks like that.
[162:25.16]It's a big circle.
[162:27.61]Sarlacc, right.
[162:29.11]So the Snorlax, what I said, Snorlax, I said you're looking tired.
[162:34.09]I didn't mean like Snorlax tired, I meant like Sarlacc pit.
[162:38.57]Like, that's just what I called him.
[162:43.73]So I didn't mean to make that be actually like Snorlax.
[162:57.08]Guys, I'm bored.
[162:58.60]And I have to like walk with this like toddler back here.
[163:01.82]Oh, thank god.
[163:22.77]Not that way.
[163:32.30]Don't you dare.
[163:34.56]Don't you dare come in one of these rooms.
[163:46.61]Where that monster is gonna be a pain in the ass.
[163:50.54]is when I don't know what's about to happen, and it happens, and I'm just running.
[163:57.16]That's going to be bad.
[163:57.92]And he's closed when he first comes in the room, and then he opens.
[164:02.66]So that's what he looks like.
[164:03.68]640.
[164:05.60]Getting there.
[164:20.93]Dev in chat, Dev in chat.
[164:22.71]What's up?
[164:24.35]What's going on?
[164:26.30]I wonder what happens when I get to a thousand.
[164:41.76]They spread them out far enough that you just forget that it's even possible.
[164:45.22]Alright, wait a minute, wait a minute.
[165:02.11]A note.
[165:02.47]A note.
[165:29.72]It's me.
[165:31.40]It's me writing those notes.
[165:35.64]I'm just getting weirder and weirder as I go.
[165:38.16]Come on, come on.
[165:40.18]You don't think you'd try to make yourself laugh when you came around the corner for like a hundredth time?
[165:44.08]I don't know what this means.
[165:45.58]Oh, is this the... Your flesh will be mine.
[165:48.18]Oh.
[165:57.79]Oh, I... This is... This is such a... This is... The person runs in front of you.
[166:05.41]Here we go.
[166:08.57]They've... I remember this.
[166:09.61]You have to go around like three or four times.
[166:11.05]Something just sprints and screams at the screen like, right now...
[166:47.37]I missed it.
[166:47.81]Good.
[166:48.09]I didn't see it.
[166:55.94]There wasn't even any music!
[166:57.12]Their music usually starts!
[167:06.40]They have a whole song!
[167:07.28]They have a whole soundtrack for these monsters!
[167:18.68]It's the clicking.
[167:20.54]Is that what it is?
[167:26.76]He's right behind me.
[167:33.09]Right, okay.
[167:53.64]What?
[167:57.35]Oh.
[167:58.37]Isn't this the... That's not the music for the... I thought that was the music for... No, I don't have... I can't do it.
[168:06.93]I have to run.
[168:08.85]Timer sprint, sprint.
[168:09.89]Go, go.
[168:10.35]Okay, okay.
[168:11.05]I'm gonna get hurt.
[168:12.39]It's okay.
[168:12.65]I can take a few hits.
[168:15.62]Oh, you bastard.
[168:33.43]Almost 700.
[168:33.69]Those can be attributed to somebody just sticking a fork into your back.
[168:50.87]Randomly.
[168:51.53]Like, I know they're in the room.
[168:53.29]Like, if Kim was sitting behind me right now with a fork, and every, like, 12 minutes she just went like that, I'd be like, It would scare me.
[169:01.09]It would be, like, fucked up.
[169:04.32]I know you're back there.
[169:05.04]I know you're gonna do it.
[169:08.20]But I don't know when or why.
[169:09.48]Why is everybody just writing single twos?
[169:21.39]Oh no!
[169:40.98]Oh no.
[170:02.38]It's dark!
[170:04.12]It was way too dark.
[170:06.47]Oh, that's horrible.
[170:07.51]I don't know where I am.
[170:08.57]What the fuck is the door?
[170:10.64]That sucks.
[170:29.29]Okay, he's far away.
[171:00.43]pog hey pog that's all I gotta say that's all I gotta say any more notes wrong way LOL pog you don't pog after LOL actually yeah maybe you can depends on the scenario I guess
[171:30.54]Thankfully no one's here.
[171:37.51]700 coming up.
[171:39.25]Just gotta make it to 700.
[171:39.97]Still don't understand what that's for.
[172:01.20]Yeah, okay.
[172:02.01]Don't fight it, right?
[172:03.01]Just run?
[172:18.42]You!
[172:21.68]I keep cutting this guy off.
[172:22.80]He's just like, I... You're...
[172:59.08]Because you're freaking me out.
[173:04.16]You don't say your submission is inevitable, and then why are you running?
[173:09.32]Fuck off.
[173:25.65]Well, I still haven't died so it appears I might be the protagonist, but I'm not entirely sure.
[173:31.63]I hope I'm not some side character that leaves notes for pointless exposition.
[173:36.51]Also, I found a strange computer that gave descriptions of the monsters and it seems like they are called effective based on how many people they kill.
[173:46.60]Well, shit.
[174:03.14]Left.
[174:03.38]Right.
[174:03.60]Right.
[174:03.84]Right, left, right, left, right, left.
[174:08.41]Straight.
[174:08.67]Right.
[174:08.91]Got it.
[174:09.15]Floor 700.
[174:09.31]That much closer.
[174:34.65]Alright, anything going on?
[174:38.27]This is my time to interact with you guys.
[174:47.50]We only have 300 rooms left, yeah?
[174:54.00]Auto.
[174:54.56]Get auto.
[174:55.82]I will at the end of the stream.
[174:59.20]I missed 666.
[175:00.42]I was being chased by a monster and I didn't want to go back to 600.
[175:06.50]Alright.
[175:08.72]Let's keep going.
[175:14.90]No, I said that by the end of the stream, if Otto wasn't on it, then I would do a 24-hour stream.
[175:22.32]So, I just have to show Otto before I turn off the stream. 701.
[175:58.55]Let's go down.
[176:05.09]No more notes.
[176:12.64]I want to see the computer again.
[176:14.02]I feel like there's a few specimens I need to take a look at that I don't know about.
[176:31.25]We go to the restaurant?
[176:33.62]Taste the beef.
[176:34.26]100% beef.
[176:37.78]What's on the menu?
[176:40.36]I can't read that far.
[176:42.30]That looks like shit, actually.
[176:44.28]It's like an old Egg McMuffin.
[176:56.04]Fun rules.
[177:00.18]Okay, well, I need a key.
[177:03.64]Behind the counter?
[177:11.29]Uh, one, I was anxious getting a job here at first, but it seems like things are getting better.
[177:15.47]This chain is really expanding, which is a shock.
[177:18.49]Because just last week, I heard this company was going broke.
[177:22.14]Every day, more and more people show up to eat here.
[177:24.94]Something still sets me off about this place and its food, though.
[177:27.46]So I'm going to try and not eat anything from here.
[177:40.06]Into the freezer?
[177:46.87]I've done that plenty of times.
[178:17.30]You guys have never done that before?
[178:18.43]You've never, like, driven to Wendy's?
[178:20.79]You get, like, two meals.
[178:23.39]You finish both of them.
[178:24.61]You park.
[178:25.11]You just eat in the... You just literally park your car and sit and eat in the parking lot.
[178:30.59]And then you just want to make sure that you're still not hungry.
[178:34.12]So then you go back and you get, like, a soda or you get, like, a Frosty or something if you want.
[178:37.58]Or a small bacon... A small bacon cheeseburger.
[178:41.84]What do they call it?
[178:42.34]The small ones.
[178:42.90]The ones that everyone loves.
[178:45.00]Junior bacon cheeseburger.
[178:47.42]Maybe you want one more.
[178:48.38]That happens often.
[178:50.22]Why?
[178:56.02]What?
[179:00.41]Somebody was in here?
[179:06.41]Did I take too long?
[179:08.09]I took too long in here.
[179:12.03]Thankfully it's 700.
[179:15.65]I stood still for too long.
[179:17.03]Okay.
[179:19.49]Anyways.
[179:21.25]I've done that before.
[179:25.98]Lost to Wendy's.
[179:28.62]Something like that.
[179:38.54]Wendy's wheel.
[179:42.06]Alright, let's go.
[179:47.14]I want to get to 800 by 3 hours and 12 minutes.
[179:49.48]That's it, that was 12 minutes from what I just said.
[180:09.95]Okay, into the restaurant.
[180:18.09]So I was in here.
[180:20.17]Can I go in any of the bathrooms?
[180:24.02]Uh-oh.
[180:26.56]Well, I broke my one rule today.
[180:28.28]The management doesn't give out actual lunch breaks.
[180:31.22]So I can't go anywhere.
[180:32.20]And they won't allow outside food here.
[180:33.97]I mean, they actually screamed at the last customer who did that.
[180:37.39]Anyway, I had a burger.
[180:38.59]It wasn't bad.
[180:39.21]And I don't feel sick.
[180:40.77]So I might get a few every now and then.
[181:00.71]It doesn't open.
[181:07.00]Got a key.
[181:18.35]Okay, I was in here, yep.
[181:21.81]They're probably... they're probably eating people.
[181:27.50]Yeah, this is a weird day.
[181:28.54]It worries me.
[181:29.54]Somebody came over here and they ordered the same thing three times.
[181:37.92]No, that's the way in.
[181:48.09]It's this one.
[181:52.65]I guess I just feel guilty for eating that burger the other day.
[182:13.36]Also, today I saw that man again, the one who kept ordering every ten minutes.
[182:17.20]This time he never even left the parking lot.
[182:21.17]Then he just got his meal parked and then back in line.
[182:24.33]He must have done it at least eight times.
[182:35.41]You must be this tall.
[182:37.05]No screams, look out for snakes, no alcohol, no diving, no hiding.
[182:40.29]We will find you.
[182:46.35]Alright, go ahead.
[182:47.53]Go ahead and laugh it up.
[182:48.73]Shoes.
[182:50.59]Exit.
[182:50.85]Alright, let's go.
[182:52.35]Oh.
[182:57.43]Goodness.
[183:01.96]There was a horrible accident today, at least that's what the managers are calling it.
[183:05.14]One of the other employees brought in some outside food and got into a fight with the manager about it.
[183:09.48]No one's coming in here, right?
[183:11.28]The employee said that the burgers here smell like sulfur.
[183:13.58]I then watched the manager grab the kid's neck and shove his head into the grill.
[183:17.73]The employee got up and ran out before anyone could do anything, and I'm told that he's fine, but that really shook me today.
[183:33.36]I can't sprint in here, if you were curious.
[183:35.22]I think because I'm crouching.
[183:40.91]This is still the same room, too.
[183:43.13]Oh, give me a break.
[183:47.03]There's something in here.
[183:47.93]What the hell is this?
[184:23.89]Get me out of this.
[184:26.19]There's a key.
[184:27.17]Okay, got the key.
[184:40.18]What's that key for?
[184:50.64]In here?
[184:51.78]The freezer.
[184:55.44]I... One of these is gonna wake up.
[185:01.85]And I hear somebody behind me.
[185:03.27]I can hear somebody here.
[185:04.93]I got another key.
[185:07.17]I hear somebody behind me.
[185:08.71]I hear somebody... What's that music supposed to mean?
[185:11.61]One of these is gonna grab me.
[185:14.56]What's the... What's the fucking key for, folks?
[185:17.70]What's the demon...
[185:21.81]What the fuck am I supposed to do about the demon?
[185:23.87]How do I get out of here?
[185:28.63]Whoa!
[185:30.63]What door is it for?
[185:32.91]That's the entrance!
[185:34.01]I'm dead.
[185:45.94]It's the Burger King demon.
[185:48.62]What?
[185:51.75]Did I just break the game?
[185:55.70]I don't know what that specimen does.
[186:05.32]I don't understand.
[186:05.94]This looks like somebody in the room.
[186:07.39]Is somebody in this room?
[186:09.65]No.
[186:12.87]He hides the doors.
[186:14.79]You dastardly motherfucker.
[186:23.83]No.
[186:25.25]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[186:27.94]It's too hard to get away from people when they're...
[186:58.36]Just go, go go go go go.
[187:17.11]Don't stop for nothing.
[187:19.33]Unless it's the squid person.
[187:25.81]No, not you again.
[187:26.77]I'm actually not scared of this person at all.
[187:42.03]I don't even know what this thing does, but it doesn't scare me.
[187:46.07]Oh, donkey.
[188:00.48]They float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float, they float.
[188:08.30]Go, they float, they float, they float.
[188:16.81]Okay, I'm good.
[188:29.88]Oh, this is bad.
[188:42.04]Okay, this sounds like when you're an English teacher.
[188:47.27]They have a Halloween event.
[188:50.15]And, like, Mrs. Stevenson recorded some scary lines.
[188:57.93]And it's played over the school haunted house.
[189:11.52]Your flesh is mine.
[189:14.96]No, but you know what I'm saying.
[189:21.16]It's like a... I made it.
[189:27.88]Weird fucking teachers.
[189:30.80]No, no.
[189:39.64]Unlimited stamina.
[189:45.19]Thanks a lot.
[189:48.27]I told you it was going to be pumpkin cheese cake latte.
[189:51.67]I told you this.
[189:52.67]And I, it's, I told you.
[190:00.71]It's gonna be pumpkin cheesecake latte.
[190:02.97]And then someone's gonna be... A scary ghost is gonna be drinking a latte at the end, and that's the joke.
[190:08.47]If I got it, don't tell me I got it.
[190:14.79]Infinite stamina.
[190:21.48]Oh, well, here's the kicker here is the stamina.
[190:23.58]There is no sprint.
[190:25.48]I can't run.
[190:31.47]I think the effectiveness of the specimens is also somewhat related to the souls of the people that they killed.
[190:35.98]Anyway, I'm still alive and strong, but I feel like the most, uh, the inmost game of my journey lies ahead.
[190:41.54]I wonder what the antagonists will look like.
[190:43.08]I hope they're cute.
[190:46.22]No more sprinting.
[190:50.76]That's not good.
[190:55.58]He's clenching his ass.
[190:57.52]I probably will be in about 100 rooms.
[191:03.08]so
[191:20.33]So how do you get away from things if you can't- do I have to seriously run- like walk in a circle to bait around in a circle and not get stabbed somehow?
[191:30.57]How does one do this?
[191:32.77]How- this is impossible.
[191:35.49]With some of these monsters.
[191:46.30]I have to kill.
[191:49.65]Infinite Axe attacks too, though.
[191:51.31]That's right.
[191:52.15]That's a good call.
[191:58.63]Just jump on them like Super Mario.
[192:04.87]Thankfully it's 750.
[192:07.47]They did that because this would be a pain in the ass to walk through all these again.
[192:11.50]So I get it.
[192:13.28]Let's make it not happen to me.
[192:27.31]Pac-Man's like my favorite character.
[192:32.86]Why would I do that?
[192:34.56]What?
[192:36.52]Oh, I can move again.
[192:44.09]Big mistake giving that back.
[192:52.86]Oh, finally, I get a computer.
[192:55.86]Finally, I get some extra computer time.
[193:01.05]Let's see.
[193:04.25]Specimen.
[193:05.41]Where were we?
[193:07.29]Eight?
[193:08.87]Okay.
[193:09.55]I have to get closer.
[193:10.75]I'm too far away from the screen.
[193:12.35]I'm standing all the way back here.
[193:15.10]Hold on.
[193:15.64]Stop.
[193:16.00]Get out.
[193:16.46]Back.
[193:19.34]There we go.
[193:20.40]Getting close.
[193:23.58]You guys have ruined me, because that said eat ass in my brain for a second.
[193:35.83]Total fatality is one.
[193:36.89]Take the dead to take the dead to take the dead to take the dead.
[193:44.28]That doesn't really help me at all, does it?
[193:50.55]This thing.
[193:52.01]Parasitic infections that form change a creature that is believed to be extraterrestrial, though it was not officially proven.
[193:59.62]Proved very effective on most subjects, but deemed too difficult to contain.
[194:02.92]The specimen broke out of its containment area due to frequent electrical malfunctions.
[194:12.64]That's the thing.
[194:13.34]A floating red figure that was found inside a secret area below a large abandoned corporate office, once owned by a restaurant franchise.
[194:21.41]The specimen is extremely violent and also seems to leave the house at will despite various containment methods.
[194:27.29]Victims vanish on contact with the specimen, but sometimes remains of the victims have been found inside the testing chamber days later.
[194:36.30]Proved not effective, as victims' souls do not remain after contact.
[194:42.83]What?
[194:43.33]What does that mean?
[194:55.05]I want to see what this thing is.
[195:00.31]Proved extremely effective on violent subjects.
[195:02.93]You have to just run away.
[195:04.11]Okay.
[195:10.88]I get it.
[195:20.30]765, let's go.
[195:22.08]Almost at the... Almost at the big 800.
[195:27.13]More of these tubes.
[195:37.98]What's the lightning strike for?
[195:44.59]I just realized that I never had a mentor figure.
[195:47.91]Trial or leaving home scene.
[195:50.49]That means this story isn't following the archetypes to make me a traditional hero.
[195:54.19]Which means I could be killed off.
[195:55.83]Well, it was nice for a little while at least.
[196:03.98]Haven't seen a special infected in a while.
[196:07.22]It's gonna happen soon.
[196:18.44]Holy shit!
[196:20.12]Holy shit, I wasn't prepared for you to be here.
[196:22.76]I hate this motherfucker so much.
[196:38.09]Ugh.
[196:43.42]Ugh.
[196:55.52]Oh, fuck!
[196:56.22]Where is he gonna be?
[196:57.56]I don't know.
[196:58.26]Somewhere over here.
[197:03.20]Oh, fuck.
[197:03.68]I've ruined everything this way.
[197:06.49]Why?
[197:11.19]Why is it giving me these same shitty rooms over and over again?
[197:19.01]You dickhead.
[197:24.55]Heal.
[197:25.67]Heal for a second.
[197:26.97]Go.
[197:37.08]Oh, fuck you, man.
[197:50.19]Okay.
[197:53.29]I'm like running out of air.
[197:54.53]I'm like a fish.
[198:00.48]He's gone.
[198:16.80]800, come on.
[198:17.42]Don't fuck around.
[198:18.66]Just get there.
[198:19.24]There's gonna be another thing that's gonna pop up.
[198:23.11]I don't care.
[198:23.61]I don't care.
[198:24.91]Special effects!
[198:34.75]Dude.
[198:49.56]See ya.
[198:53.04]It's the English teacher.
[198:57.62]Alright, alright.
[199:00.20]No more.
[199:00.58]No more getting stuck on that one.
[199:02.78]So, English teacher.
[199:08.22]See ya.
[199:13.89]Eight hundred.
[199:16.65]Two hundred more.
[199:17.21]Almost there.
[199:20.61]Dermalink, please.
[199:21.81]Dermal, please.
[199:23.61]Dermal, please say hello.
[199:26.63]Like, hello?
[199:28.47]Why?
[199:28.78]I don't understand.
[199:32.66]Why?
[199:33.06]The link didn't open, by the way.
[199:50.46]click this link alright hold on I want to put this on stream I want to read this one hi did I save the game did I save the game I don't I don't think I saved the game I don't think did I save it
[200:19.72]Wait, what happened?
[200:21.32]What is going on?
[200:22.28]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[200:23.24]This is like a... I can't see the chat room.
[200:26.50]What happened?
[200:31.59]Chat is broken right now.
[200:50.00]Why did it open like five doors?
[201:20.47]That's a pretty good one.
[201:49.17]I hope I saved the game.
[201:51.15]Because that would be annoying.
[201:52.07]I would hate to have to go through those 50 zones again.
[201:57.14]800.
[201:57.36]Thank god.
[201:57.86]Saved.
[201:58.30]800.
[201:58.34]Got the axe.
[201:59.62]I'm ready.
[202:00.30]Let's move.
[202:13.94]I'm gonna find out what the real story of this game actually is.
[202:17.64]Did I, like, did I make it to 800?
[202:19.38]In the time that was, uh, blocked?
[202:25.89]I didn't realize that guy had a unique kill screen in save rooms.
[202:28.87]That's completely new to me.
[202:33.07]Yeah, that... That was kind of weird.
[202:36.55]Yeah.
[202:43.29]Day 2.
[202:45.03]Food supply depleted.
[202:46.03]Water supply at 30%.
[202:46.81]Mental health deteriorating.
[202:48.47]Leaving notes behind to help others and mark where I've been.
[202:50.99]Is there more?
[202:52.80]No.
[203:02.90]Day 2.
[203:04.09]Room 800.
[203:10.99]Well, I'll be fair to the game.
[203:13.65]I've been streaming for three and a half hours and gone through 800 rooms, so, I mean, that's... That makes sense.
[203:20.30]It would take you that long if you weren't sprinting.
[203:44.48]Do I always wait till 8.09?
[203:45.34]7.09?
[203:45.78]Okay.
[203:46.36]It's still the same room, somehow.
[204:05.60]Broken.
[204:06.74]This is a big room.
[204:12.88]That's strange.
[204:13.24]Locked.
[204:13.56]Probably have to go up the stairs.
[204:42.18]broken okay god damn library someone's gonna be here I can hear him coming down the hallway I need to hide but I don't know where I now know this is not an exit or a resting place it's just another specimen room I think he's outside the door now well where do I hide where do you hide huh
[205:15.66]This is a two-year-old hiding spot.
[205:46.34]Is he gone?
[205:47.38]Where is he?
[205:53.13]Come out, come out.
[206:06.10]Look up there, his head's gonna be poking over and he's gonna go, HEY!
[206:09.36]And it's gonna be terrifying.
[206:29.15]Let's go upstairs.
[206:34.85]Locked doors.
[206:40.61]I can't hide there?
[206:41.25]Hide.
[206:58.83]So wait, he's not real.
[207:00.53]So then he can't hurt me.
[207:04.15]So I'll be fine.
[207:06.26]Confront him.
[207:08.06]I need a key.
[207:17.95]Oh, these doors are broken?
[207:18.91]Come on.
[207:30.03]Hmm.
[207:32.01]Hmm.
[208:13.10]Every room looks the same.
[208:47.19]Every room is the same room.
[209:40.65]That's one squeaky gamer chair.
[209:47.31]I'll tell you, I don't think that guy could lift that scythe.
[209:51.10]I don't think I have anything to worry about.
[209:52.34]That looks a little too heavy for you.
[209:58.64]Can I recommend... a sickle?
[210:03.07]Can I recommend... Can I recommend a knife?
[210:18.14]It is a sickle.
[210:20.00]That's a scythe.
[210:20.68]A scythe is a small scythe.
[210:22.70]A scythe is huge.
[210:25.16]A scythe is like a harvesting scythe.
[210:29.55]Pick up the key.
[210:31.01]Get the library key.
[210:32.47]Nice.
[210:37.29]So that's bedroom, bedroom.
[210:39.13]Library.
[210:42.38]We are currently looking for a library.
[210:45.78]Locked.
[211:01.77]Is this the library?
[211:03.87]No.
[211:06.66]The library is probably... Let's try this one.
[211:11.12]Hold on a second here.
[211:15.20]Library.
[211:16.26]No.
[211:17.84]Library.
[211:19.88]Library.
[211:30.06]Library.
[211:30.62]What the fuck is happening?
[212:03.30]None of these are the library.
[212:07.12]That's not the library?
[212:33.49]What?
[212:36.72]I don't know where the library is.
[212:38.88]Where is it?
[212:45.79]Stop it.
[212:46.39]Stop.
[212:46.95]I've been in every single door.
[212:49.23]I've been in every door.
[213:02.59]in all the same room!
[213:04.21]Oh my god!
[213:05.99]There's a book missing.
[213:17.99]Oh, fucking no.
[213:19.61]I gotta... Now I gotta go to the other...
[213:36.31]Hide.
[213:36.81]Hide.
[213:53.10]This is the relatable content that I come here for.
[213:57.66]Thanks a lot.
[214:03.81]I feel like I could just go push him.
[214:07.71]That's a full four and a half seconds for you to lift up that.
[214:10.65]I could just shove you to the ground.
[214:24.42]Do it then.
[214:25.12]No, because this is taking way too long.
[214:39.88]I'm just gonna go.
[214:40.44]Are they gone?
[214:46.46]I didn't hear the door open.
[214:54.77]Picked up the book.
[215:01.77]Go replace the book in the library.
[215:13.66]Secret door.
[215:20.12]Finally made it out of here.
[215:24.12]What the hell is this?
[215:39.81]What the fuck does that mean?
[215:43.81]I'm still in room 810?
[215:45.63]Oh, man.
[215:56.57]Oh, remember when the note said I could hear people running around down here?
[216:03.00]Was that hearing me?
[216:11.39]What does that mean?
[216:13.13]Why is this music changing?
[216:16.67]Oh, give me a break.
[216:19.37]Are you still doing laps upstairs?
[216:34.04]I get a note down here.
[216:35.50]I can hear somebody running around in circles upstairs.
[216:39.56]It's really odd.
[216:41.63]I wonder what they're up to.
[216:55.04]This is all one floor.
[216:56.86]I hope I make it to 850.
[216:58.14]Because I don't want to do this whole thing again.
[217:09.71]We're good.
[217:17.77]Exit.
[217:18.67]Exit key.
[217:20.73]What do you mean, the exit key?
[217:24.22]I don't know.
[217:41.99]I know, it's the door.
[217:43.07]It's the door.
[217:45.23]It's the door up here.
[217:48.33]It's up, and then it's somewhere.
[217:52.23]I have to remember.
[217:52.77]I'm a goldfish, goldfish, goldfish, goldfish kid.
[217:57.25]I'm a goldfish kid.
[218:05.51]Go up!
[218:06.89]Out!
[218:08.15]Out of here!
[218:08.58]Out of here!
[218:09.02]Out of here!
[218:09.96]Oh no, I'm gonna get lost again!
[218:15.46]Woo!
[218:16.28]Woo!
[218:54.81]That's what somebody- That bagpipe player face.
[219:01.02]Don't make me laugh right now.
[219:03.78]A bagpipe player.
[219:12.38]What does that even mean?
[219:17.63]Give me an 850.
[219:20.17]Ah, shit.
[219:25.78]Hello?
[219:26.28]Why is somebody linking me saying hello?
[220:01.71]Nobody was.
[220:03.65]I think one person did actually.
[220:06.35]One person linked me saying hello.
[220:09.43]And I said everybody.
[220:11.39]I just lumped you all together.
[220:19.21]Only like ten more.
[220:27.47]What is it?
[220:27.91]What is it though?
[220:28.55]What is it?
[220:30.21]Okay, stay close.
[220:32.75]Come here.
[220:36.95]There's a thing blocking me!
[220:38.15]I'm so glad I only have to do this for like six more floors.
[221:14.71]He doesn't know.
[221:19.30]No, I don't.
[221:21.86]I do not.
[221:22.38]You're right.
[221:23.00]I don't know.
[221:23.70]I don't know.
[221:43.10]49.
[221:43.12]Alright, let's go.
[221:47.96]50.
[221:54.86]Oh, this is bad.
[221:56.06]Okay, I have to do all 100.
[222:02.40]That's not good.
[222:07.07]What am I- what am I doing?! !
[222:12.54]I got complacent for like 30 seconds!
[222:24.75]Just run now.
[222:25.39]No, I'm good.
[222:27.52]I didn't go away far enough for long enough.
[222:34.44]I don't want to do this again, so I need to be locked in to get to 900.
[222:53.00]Okay.
[223:00.30]At least this gives me a minute to relax.
[223:06.87]I think this is locked.
[223:09.01]I may have made a mistake coming back here.
[223:10.41]This is locked, I think.
[223:12.55]Check it?
[223:13.05]No.
[223:18.87]Jerma, attack it?
[223:19.63]No.
[223:25.81]I'm not gonna... He's still here.
[223:29.07]He's still here.
[223:31.37]He's still here.
[224:11.25]It's this way.
[224:12.05]Good thing I did it.
[224:15.01]Either way, it doesn't matter.
[224:17.27]Just run.
[224:17.97]You cannot run.
[224:19.85]Come on, guys.
[224:21.05]Don't you know this by now?
[224:22.47]I can't run from this thing.
[224:24.59]If I run far enough away, it turns into another monster that I cannot run from.
[224:31.08]Now we're good.
[224:38.28]Almost there.
[224:41.34]Not long now.
[224:46.60]Just go faster.
[224:47.58]I have a stamina bar.
[224:49.50]I can't do that.
[225:05.26]I'm just waiting to hear that pound.
[225:09.40]It's a ding.
[225:10.16]It's a ding-dong.
[225:15.06]Left.
[225:16.42]Left.
[225:17.58]Three lefts.
[225:18.64]And then a straight.
[225:20.63]Three lefts and then a right.
[225:21.49]I'm good.
[225:38.05]Game room.
[225:39.63]I've already played all these.
[225:40.55]30 more rooms.
[225:45.62]Uh-oh.
[225:46.24]Is it... Oh, it's this thing.
[225:50.84]I forget.
[225:51.26]I remember.
[225:51.68]I forget what this one does.
[225:52.68]I have to go back and then run this way.
[225:55.96]It's gonna scream.
[225:56.76]Get ready.
[225:57.64]Here comes the scream.
[225:58.89]It's gonna scream at you.
[226:30.82]Just do it already.
[226:32.06]Alright, sit up.
[226:38.34]Don't lose it here.
[226:51.11]I can taste it.
[226:51.81]Come on.
[227:10.65]What is it?
[227:11.11]What is it?
[227:11.47]What does that mean?
[227:12.57]I don't remember.
[227:13.89]There's too many monsters to remember.
[227:29.16]I looked at chat for a second and it was one of those paupers.
[227:42.23]What is it?
[227:42.63]Bug!
[227:49.50]I'm actually okay with this.
[227:50.40]I'm alright with this.
[227:54.00]That's fine.
[227:55.72]It's just not knowing what it is.
[228:01.96]I can't believe I'm actually going to do this.
[228:03.77]I'm gonna get to floor a thousand.
[228:19.14]Four more and I get to 900.
[228:24.46]Almost there.
[228:31.90]One.
[228:32.22]Two.
[228:32.72]899.
[228:34.08]This is it.
[228:34.67]This is the home stretch.
[228:40.37]Only 100 more floors.
[228:45.73]And that's it.
[228:46.95]And I beat the game.
[228:55.41]Here we go.
[229:07.10]You're still on the first island.
[229:10.18]We used that one last night.
[229:13.98]Go.
[229:20.46]Ding-dong.
[229:24.33]Right.
[229:24.77]Left.
[229:27.49]Left, right.
[229:29.37]Left, right, left.
[229:31.35]Left, right, left, right.
[229:33.36]Aye.
[229:37.34]Left, left.
[229:45.40]Straight.
[229:48.00]Okay.
[229:54.08]day three hallucinations are manifesting at increasing intervals the cause is probably sleep deprivation or a gas that is being pumped into the rooms I've not yet been injured so I don't think the cause is a brain injury or blood clot
[230:21.32]Oh, no.
[230:22.40]It's this thing.
[230:23.36]Oh, no.
[230:25.24]Count how many times I've said, oh, no.
[230:29.09]Or, what does he do?
[230:31.79]What does he do?
[230:32.17]What does he do?
[230:46.53]Research report.
[230:47.77]More whales are being shipped to the facility tomorrow.
[230:50.79]Wow.
[230:52.37]One for a health inspection, and two that are already dead for autopsies.
[230:56.45]That thing's gonna attack me from somewhere!
[230:58.96]More and more beached whales keep appearing around these islands, and I still can't find out what's causing it.
[231:07.24]I don't even have a flashlight or anything.
[231:10.37]I am going to get stuck here.
[231:16.62]There's the whale.
[231:51.34]What the hell is going on in this game?
[231:57.12]And now I have to deal with this stuff.
[231:58.46]I have to try to remember this.
[231:59.70]It's so dark.
[232:00.38]I'm gonna get so lost.
[232:08.66]The research facility is now in dire need of more engineers.
[232:12.17]We have a whole block that is flooded and some vital staff are missing.
[232:15.51]Is there a key or something?
[232:24.71]Shit.
[232:28.29]Can we get a sweat check?
[232:32.64]It's going.
[232:33.08]Oh, it's going.
[232:49.60]I just got a lantern.
[233:27.20]This thing doesn't run out of gas, right?
[233:30.78]Alright.
[233:59.03]four one what was it four one four one three what four one three four one two three here it is
[234:26.45]Read.
[234:28.53]I hear a girl or an animal or something singing to me, pleading that I come outside my locked room and let the sweeping waves comfort me.
[234:39.20]Water pump control.
[234:41.62]Restarting pumps.
[234:46.76]What is that?
[234:47.76]Where do I go?
[234:49.76]What does that even do?
[234:50.92]What does that do?
[234:53.10]What's that even do though?
[234:53.92]What's that do?
[234:56.49]Is it the whale?
[234:57.45]Did I drain the pump?
[234:59.11]Did I drain the whale?
[235:06.91]I just went to the same place twice.
[235:40.47]There is one, two doors here.
[235:44.96]Am I under water?
[236:00.72]Is it going to be like a killer whale?
[236:02.79]The whale is going to be on here.
[236:24.51]There's nothing in this room.
[236:35.79]Locked.
[236:41.11]Did I try every door?
[236:42.51]Broken.
[236:44.72]It's not... It's... Broken.
[236:49.58]Did I miss, like, a key on the ground or anything in here at all?
[236:57.74]I don't think there's anything in here.
[237:04.22]Why would I be able to come in here, though?
[237:11.34]Okay.
[237:23.90]Nothing in here either.
[237:30.34]Funny joke.
[237:30.92]What the hell are you talking about?
[237:35.18]What do you mean funny joke?
[237:36.84]I'm trying to go in all these doors and there's nothing in any of them.
[237:41.00]There's a key on the box.
[237:43.22]What?
[237:50.72]like in this room okay let me be fucking real with you for a second that key is painted on the top of the box
[238:22.55]It's all good.
[238:23.51]Alright.
[238:30.06]Where's the locked one?
[238:31.82]There's a locked one here.
[238:38.82]Can't go in that locked one.
[238:40.18]And there's nothing else in here.
[238:43.96]So this is a key for a different door back here.
[238:48.09]You're legally mad.
[238:49.69]And you're internally sad.
[238:52.02]What about over here?
[238:54.18]Broken.
[238:54.68]Come on!
[238:56.95]Who the hell are you?
[239:03.35]Whoa!
[239:04.09]You're an enemy and you're now in the... Am I safe here?
[239:12.62]I think I'm safe here.
[239:16.50]Holy fucking hell!
[239:23.50]I'm safe on the boxes.
[239:27.18]Wait for full health.
[239:28.04]Go.
[239:51.08]This way.
[239:54.33]And then this way.
[240:02.70]It's not so bad once you know what you're doing.
[240:29.30]There's even more of this shit.
[240:30.62]At least the numbers are going up.
[240:37.41]Box steps.
[240:39.67]What happened to the whale?
[240:57.43]Oh!
[240:58.87]Anybody see a box?
[241:00.81]I don't see a box.
[241:10.59]I think I just screwed myself.
[241:11.59]Nope, right here.
[241:19.62]Let's go right.
[241:42.40]How many more of these do I have to do?
[242:04.87]919!
[242:04.89]920!
[242:05.81]Am I just stuck down here for the rest of the time that I play this game?
[242:16.54]Okay.
[242:18.94]I got out of the water.
[242:19.78]Where is it?
[242:44.45]My phone?
[242:45.11]All I have is an axe.
[242:49.54]Holy shit, it's the guy with the thing in his arm!
[242:52.06]What are you?
[243:05.10]I thought it was him.
[243:07.66]I thought that was him.
[243:20.13]I went the long way.
[243:20.93]I'm good.
[243:23.19]Wii U stream confirmed.
[243:48.36]Hide.
[243:48.60]I have to hide.
[243:50.96]I think.
[243:51.23]No?
[243:51.29]What do you mean, we, you?
[243:58.47]Alright.
[244:01.61]Give me something at 950.
[244:02.64]I don't care if the last 50 rooms are absolute hell.
[244:06.06]I don't care.
[244:06.58]Give me 950.
[244:07.08]Give it to me.
[244:25.21]45.
[244:31.05]I don't want to go through that whole whale shit again.
[244:47.54]There has to be a checkpoint at 950.
[244:51.86]Right?
[244:52.92]That would make sense.
[245:02.60]No.
[245:04.93]I could be on my A-game here.
[245:11.57]Okay.
[245:13.17]Haven't seen you in a while.
[245:54.73]It's darker.
[246:22.94]I don't like this mod.
[246:24.12]Whoa, he's behind me.
[246:50.91]No, don't play this music right now.
[246:54.51]Not an appropriate time for the music.
[247:28.21]Another long hallway.
[247:29.67]He's fast.
[247:41.34]He's still chasing me.
[247:59.10]This game's not even fucking scary, dude.
[248:09.91]Let's go almost there.
[248:12.13]I'm almost done walking through a thousand rooms.
[248:26.51]The last 10.
[248:28.09]It's gonna give me something at the last 10.
[248:29.79]It's gonna do something fucked up.
[248:33.77]It's gonna throw a bunch of stuff at me.
[248:35.17]Here we go.
[248:37.89]No, nothing.
[248:38.51]990.
[248:38.57]See?
[248:39.75]I told you.
[248:42.83]I told you.
[248:51.87]Why is this here?
[248:52.57]No, I'm...
[249:07.86]So the house was alive.
[249:09.02]And then this dude.
[249:38.22]Okay, I'm... I'm... I'm... This is not a time to use the computer.
[249:46.21]This is not a time to use the PC.
[249:47.77]This is time to leave.
[249:49.19]And go to 1000.
[250:20.05]The dev, the dev.
[250:20.85]What do you mean?
[250:22.03]What about the dev?
[250:22.81]What?
[250:24.33]Dev in chat.
[250:25.13]Dev actually in chat.
[250:30.85]Ignoring dev.
[250:34.92]They're offering to add you.
[250:40.92]You mean on the wall?
[250:43.14]On the wall?
[250:47.52]Take a screenshot from that.
[250:57.97]I'm gonna be on the wall.
[250:59.81]That's fucking hilarious.
[251:03.69]Or take, uh, what's better, that or the me looking really angry into the camera.
[251:13.67]Or the bagpipe face.
[251:17.27]We need something high res.
[251:20.13]The full screen really angry, just like pissed off, like lunging into the camera.
[251:28.63]Do a high-res version?
[251:30.29]Okay.
[251:40.51]I got, like, chapstick all over my mouth.
[251:43.67]Okay, here's a high-res version.
[251:48.68]No, don't look in the camera.
[251:49.58]I'm supposed to be playing a game.
[251:50.48]Okay.
[251:54.54]Like, how should I do this?
[251:57.95]How about this?
[252:01.43]Oh!
[252:02.19]You can use that one.
[252:04.37]Play it like this.
[252:06.10]I'm acting.
[252:06.58]Yeah, this is acting.
[252:08.36]Angry.
[252:08.64]I don't even know what the bagpipe face was.
[252:15.14]That's one.
[252:18.57]Or how about like, how about this?
[252:21.17]How about this one?
[252:31.33]Use any of those.
[252:32.29]It doesn't matter.
[252:39.31]He's an egomaniac.
[252:42.79]Did you see that fucking face?
[252:45.33]Use that one.
[252:46.22]Use that.
[252:47.10]That's the one.
[252:47.98]No, that's the one.
[252:50.28]I had like a frog mouth.
[252:52.70]No, that's the one.
[252:53.32]Take it.
[252:56.52]How would I be?
[252:57.64]I'm playing.
[252:58.06]I'm supposed to be getting scared.
[253:07.80]I'm so glad that the game was paused.
[253:10.46]Alright, last five floors.
[253:11.60]I'm ready.
[253:14.27]Imagine scrolling through that wall.
[253:16.77]It's like, oh, here are the YouTubers, here are the streamers.
[253:19.61]And then you get to that one.
[253:21.81]You're going to be like, out of the four of them, that one's the worst.
[253:34.84]Make mine like a little bigger, though.
[253:36.18]Make mine like two times too big.
[253:37.72]1996.
[253:37.74]Why am I giving it a date?
[253:40.20]1996. 1996.
[254:15.17]I did it.
[254:40.19]You thought I was stuck here.
[254:48.45]Look it, it's perfect!
[254:50.61]It's a beautiful world!
[254:56.29]Wow!
[254:59.52]I am small!
[255:00.76]I win!
[255:17.56]Oh, I don't win.
[255:19.10]I don't win.
[255:20.30]Vista Sky Fiddler.
[255:21.74]Fake Sky Screensaver has been disabled.
[255:24.68]Oh.
[255:25.24]What?
[255:48.04]Was that one take?
[255:48.92]Alright, here we go.
[256:04.23]The final test.
[256:05.25]It's the English teacher.
[256:27.98]Oh, it just opens.
[256:29.24]I just press my face against it, okay.
[256:34.73]What door is the real door?
[256:35.89]That's the question.
[256:41.41]None of them. 731.
[256:49.98]This is room 731.
[256:50.80]Hello?
[256:51.20]Yeah?
[256:51.48]You're alright.
[256:53.94]What happened?
[257:13.06]Take to the dead, take to the dead.
[257:16.10]I just spawned the final boss of the game.
[257:18.56]Let's go motherfucker!
[257:20.60]Let's go!
[257:21.96]Let's go Ganondorf!
[257:32.22]It's a scream stream.
[257:34.50]Hey!
[258:10.21]Hit his hand?
[258:26.54]Why?
[258:30.14]This is a Silent Hill boss.
[258:33.26]Oh, oh!
[258:51.74]The screaming!
[258:53.20]The SCREAMING!
[259:02.78]Let's do it.
[259:26.24]I'm good.
[259:34.56]Do it!
[259:35.82]Just twice, do it!
[259:43.46]Stop!
[259:49.28]I can't see those!
[259:54.76]Dammit.
[260:18.54]Alright, come on.
[260:19.98]Don't screw this up.
[260:20.69]They travel the same speed.
[260:48.51]Come on, don't mess it up.
[261:07.42]That's not it.
[261:25.42]Why am I fighting myself?
[261:27.08]I don't know that!
[261:27.90]You just spoiled the end of the game for me!
[261:30.60]You just spoiled the end of the whole game!
[261:57.25]Oh.
[261:58.47]What?
[261:58.75]What?
[262:26.49]I'm like a mushroom or something.
[262:29.95]I'm going to be like a cupcake.
[262:31.53]Did you really think it was going to end?
[262:36.23]Seriously?
[262:37.43]Kind of.
[262:55.94]You, I did one, I won.
[263:03.67]That was Spooky's Jump Scare Mansion HD renovation.
[263:13.59]They were here!
[263:15.22]They were here.
[263:22.44]What was this music?
[263:23.08]This is kinda, this is good shit.
[263:37.41]Oh yeah, I went through all thousand rooms.
[263:42.63]This DLC.
[263:44.68]Is there?
[264:00.15]Screaming Man!
[264:04.11]We gotta give it to Screaming Man for that performance.
[264:08.14]That was actually a full-on, I'm just gonna hit record on Audacity and scream into the mic as loud as you can.
[264:17.38]Gotta give it up.
[264:21.20]Time to show Otto.
[264:22.99]The stream's not over.
[264:23.75]The stream is not over.
[264:32.35]End of them.
[264:44.69]I thank you for playing.
[264:46.37]It was, it was, it was jumpy.
[264:50.77]It was very jumpy.
[264:51.57]I'll give you that.
[264:52.05]It was very, it was very jumpy.
[265:01.80]It was good.
[265:06.74]But hold on.
[265:07.14]New game.
[265:13.10]Unlock the secrets of the strange hospital.
[265:18.72]Wait, why am I at 995?
[265:28.15]Every day is Wednesday.
[265:29.25]This is an alternate timeline?
[265:43.23]Uh, yes.
[265:44.17]It seems to be that way.
[265:53.00]I don't know where we ended up.
[265:54.26]I don't know what floor we're on.
[265:57.79]We'll find out.
[265:59.11]There is no floors.
[266:00.45]There is no rooms.
[266:01.35]It's just go.
[266:06.69]Still have the axe?
[266:10.39]Yeah, there are no rooms.
[266:11.19]This is just a stand-alone no rooms.
[266:27.76]Let's go to the far one.
[266:42.31]Oh.
[266:42.55]Well?
[266:42.71]Goodbye!
[267:01.74]Yeah, this game is a show of endurance.
[267:04.30]You know what I mean?
[267:05.86]You want to get jumpscared and things popping out of walls for a thousand rooms.
[267:09.68]It's a show of endurance.
[267:10.94]I'm putting this on my gamer license card.
[267:16.29]Karamari Hospital.
[267:19.25]Alright.
[267:25.61]Nope.
[267:27.79]I just got an achievement for doing that.
[267:31.42]Water bubbler.
[267:31.98]This is where you save the game.
[267:34.32]The drinking fountain.
[267:40.12]Well, that's nice.
[267:41.26]Okay.
[267:41.76]There's a bathroom.
[267:44.59]Let's go here.
[267:47.31]Can't go here.
[267:48.13]Let's go here.
[267:50.21]Can't go here.
[267:55.29]Broken.
[267:55.67]Ugh.
[267:56.67]Ugh.
[268:01.90]You need to go to the doctor.
[268:02.90]Um... Immediately.
[268:08.40]Hopefully within the next 10 minutes.
[268:10.63]Because... That's not alright.
[268:20.25]I'm so glad that you added flushing toilets in the DLC.
[268:26.23]Think of a joke quick.
[268:27.21]There's blood in a urinal.
[268:39.81]I mean, it's an improv class.
[268:42.23]Let's do, uh, blood, uh, in a urinal.
[268:45.09]And, uh, you're at the hospital.
[268:46.67]And, um, and there's a banana involved.
[268:49.08]Okay, well.
[268:55.38]Gotta use the bat.
[268:56.12]No, that's gonna go bad.
[269:12.42]It's getting scary.
[269:16.33]Never say no to an improv session.
[269:22.87]I wonder how poorly I would do at an improv session.
[269:26.49]That'd probably be pretty bad.
[269:27.59]It would be bad.
[269:28.09]I would be doing stream references.
[269:33.61]And all the people that were there watching the improv session would have no idea what they were.
[269:38.24]I would throw, you'd say at least one or two, like, look at me's.
[269:41.52]And the people watching would be like, that's not funny.
[269:47.79]Wait, hold on.
[269:49.23]Patient displayed increased depression after informed of their terminal disease.
[269:52.93]I prescribed an antidepressant to regulate this, but was later told that I had canceled the prescription.
[269:56.57]I have no memory of canceling the meds, nor have I found any evidence that my orders were tampered with.
[270:02.31]Okay.
[270:05.23]Now it's a yes and a string.
[270:13.76]I remember playing SCP with these stairs.
[270:18.72]Let me check the other rooms.
[270:24.87]That stream would start out with a bunch of people watching.
[270:29.05]And then, after they realized that this was not a good improv session, half of the people would leave.
[270:38.44]They would be like, wow, an improv session on Twitch.
[270:40.80]This is so interesting.
[270:42.08]Wow, that's so cool.
[270:43.60]And look at me.
[270:44.60]Look at me.
[270:45.22]I got a banana here.
[270:46.42]Oh, whoopsie.
[270:47.14]And it would be like this.
[270:50.85]I ain't a professional.
[270:52.59]I'm a professional clown.
[271:04.25]Hey.
[271:10.50]I can't move that way.
[271:13.60]Broken.
[271:14.60]Broken.
[271:16.62]It might be fun, though.
[271:23.77]Office key.
[271:29.29]Seems we're losing patients due to surgical complications much more often than normal.
[271:32.67]What have the doctors been doing?
[271:34.76]Half these procedures seem completely unnecessary.
[271:36.74]I know the doctors and surgeons are above me.
[271:39.06]And probably know many things I don't, but this is getting strange.
[271:51.51]Oh.
[271:52.51]Oh, by the way.
[271:54.67]This is just coming out of left field here.
[271:57.55]But...
[272:01.18]I know I mentioned it yesterday, but I'm going in front of the green screen again.
[272:07.93]And probably like at some point after Halloween.
[272:14.01]At some point after Halloween, like maybe the first week of November or something, we're going to do a green screen part two DLC for free edition.
[272:22.92]Where I spend like another five to six hours doing all the things that anybody wants me to do.
[272:30.13]That's after Halloween.
[272:36.94]After Halloween.
[272:40.24]Do six hours of look at me.
[272:43.08]I'm not going to do that.
[272:43.68]Alright, I got the office key.
[272:53.22]That's that.
[272:53.62]Alright, it's upstairs and I think it's one of the ones I couldn't do before.
[272:59.47]So there has not been a monster yet.
[273:05.44]Which is the one that was locked?
[273:10.54]Stairs.
[273:13.30]Broken.
[273:15.18]No.
[273:17.86]Remember, wash your hands.
[273:24.95]Remember, wash your hands, everyone, of a
[273:31.40]Remember, wash your hands.
[273:39.72]Remember, wash your hands, everyone.
[273:46.33]Clean your workspace.
[273:49.07]I'm attending to the office.
[273:52.41]Work hard and have a nice day.
[273:54.05]I don't know.
[273:54.91]I can't read that.
[274:00.66]Any of you guys in office?
[274:02.18]Which one of you guys is in office?
[274:03.28]None of you are in office.
[274:07.17]So where's the office?
[274:11.91]Back here?
[274:18.68]Looks like an office.
[274:20.69]Okay.
[274:51.41]Broken.
[274:53.57]Broken.
[274:55.85]Another office.
[274:58.39]What's that?
[274:59.41]Looks like something goes here.
[275:03.05]So there's a little thing that's gotta fit in that slot, a little circle.
[275:09.59]What the fuck?
[275:10.67]What the fuck are these pictures?
[275:15.19]Broken.
[275:22.13]Nothing in here.
[275:22.71]I don't know.
[275:27.93]Another note.
[275:29.41]I was just informed that the procedure to extract the patient's liver became fatal.
[275:32.62]I don't know why.
[275:33.52]Why did we take his liver?
[275:35.36]There are no donation requests and he was showing signs of improvement.
[275:39.28]The surgical staff told me I personally demanded the liver be removed for an emergency transplant and the worst thing is I found it.
[275:46.65]I found his liver.
[275:47.43]His entire liver just sitting on my desk.
[275:56.33]Maintenance key.
[276:00.61]That's horrible.
[276:04.98]Maintenance?
[276:07.24]Def... deformity wing.
[276:10.74]Looks fake.
[276:17.08]It's electrically sealed.
[276:20.05]I blacked out today while driving to work.
[276:22.69]One minute I was driving down the road and then in an instant I was standing outside my car staring down at a dead cat.
[276:27.99]I must have hit it with my car and felt sorry.
[276:30.52]The image of the dead cat has constantly unnerved me today.
[276:33.22]How did I manage to hit it in such a way to make the body completely twisted around like that?
[276:40.82]That's not good.
[276:41.36]Alright, I have the maintenance key now.
[276:51.73]Maintenance.
[276:54.51]Save it.
[276:58.33]So we've got two ways to go here.
[277:00.09]This is not open, but where's maintenance?
[277:04.99]Because these are hospital rooms.
[277:09.15]The stairs going down.
[277:10.47]Was it another stairway?
[277:11.65]Was it downstairs?
[277:12.39]Because this is locked.
[277:14.53]I would feel like a maintenance room would be down here.
[277:29.65]Right there.
[277:30.05]There we go.
[277:32.71]Maintenance room.
[277:36.46]The generator powered down.
[277:37.82]Uh... It won't turn back on.
[277:50.17]Oh, this is good.
[278:00.74]Why did you do that?
[278:02.64]To progress the story!
[278:04.88]To progress the game!
[278:10.67]Well, I definitely have to just go back upstairs.
[278:16.71]So this is not so much a... This is like a whole new little mini-game, huh?
[278:56.74]Where was that, like, tendril?
[279:03.64]Wasn't there a tendril?
[279:13.37]There was, like, that big, like, uh... amorphous thing.
[279:18.02]You guys know what I'm talking about.
[279:21.36]Remember the thing I was trying to hit with the axe?
[279:22.62]It was down one of these hallways.
[279:25.10]It's fake.
[279:43.77]Okay.
[279:59.85]What the hell?
[280:03.15]Let's paint it on.
[280:11.31]Nope.
[280:13.64]Oh, God.
[280:13.90]Ugh.
[280:13.98]What?
[280:52.92]Something going to happen here?
[281:02.27]Something is happening.
[281:15.44]What's going on?
[281:16.32]Why is it happening?
[281:22.76]What are the numbers?
[281:24.30]Are there numbers?
[281:24.96]I feel like I shouldn't move yet.
[281:54.30]That was cool.
[281:57.80]Maybe I have to do that eventually for some other reason.
[282:07.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[282:29.96]Where is this happening?
[282:34.82]It's Screaming Man Encore.
[282:47.30]Just a couple of bags.
[282:49.08]Not a big deal.
[283:02.07]Oh, you better believe that guy's gonna start following me around.
[283:25.15]Ugh.
[283:36.25]Upstairs... A lot of fucking halls.
[283:51.56]It is a hospital, so I guess that makes sense.
[284:01.40]Just looking for a note.
[284:04.08]Anything to explain anything.
[284:08.44]Oh, back here.
[284:14.24]I need to find that thing that goes in the wall.
[284:23.73]What about these stairs?
[284:24.51]They go up or down?
[284:26.71]They go down.
[284:31.95]This is the thing I was talking about.
[284:33.05]It's down here.
[284:33.71]Right here.
[284:34.05]See?
[284:34.27]That's what I was talking about.
[284:39.23]Nothing else I can do down here?
[284:43.43]No.
[284:43.55]I'll go back up there.
[284:54.68]Walk through it?
[284:55.38]I don't think I can.
[284:56.04]Alright.
[285:05.39]So...
[285:08.01]I need a medallion for the office.
[285:15.03]Why did he not check the one right path?
[285:19.38]I'm trying.
[285:20.62]There's like 50 doors in here.
[285:36.41]Broken stairs.
[285:39.50]And there's the guy standing in front of the door with the bags.
[285:44.10]I don't know what the hell to do with that guy, though.
[285:54.25]He's not there anymore.
[286:17.63]Morgue what else is down here just the morgue and then the isolation room Somebody have like a key on them or something you there it is.
[286:40.58]Oh
[286:43.10]Yep.
[286:43.48]Now I'm gonna be chased.
[286:44.90]I just activated Guy is now coming after you forever now.
[286:49.26]I know.
[286:50.14]I knew it.
[286:50.64]I knew it was gonna fucking happen.
[286:52.14]I've told you.
[286:52.80]I said it out loud.
[286:54.58]I said it out loud.
[286:59.05]I have to turn and run the other way.
[287:00.11]I think, uh, folks, that's what has to happen.
[287:36.92]I don't want anything to do with that.
[287:46.37]Well, keep going, recruit, and I'm sure you'll make it out.
[287:52.99]Maybe.
[288:02.66]I have a misplaced camera.
[288:04.92]Oh, shit.
[288:05.54]Sorry about that.
[288:08.00]I didn't know.
[288:08.62]Alright, office.
[288:12.36]I need to find that guy with the thing behind his computer.
[288:15.59]That room?
[288:16.33]I think it's this one.
[288:21.35]No, it's not.
[288:22.03]Which office room is that?
[288:26.07]Not this one.
[288:31.03]Not that one.
[288:33.69]Save the game.
[288:36.21]Oh, fuck, you're right.
[288:37.03]I'm gonna go save.
[288:47.98]I'm gonna go save the game.
[288:51.40]I didn't save the game.
[288:53.71]I'm gonna save the game.
[288:58.79]It's left.
[289:03.38]And then... No, it's over here.
[289:06.22]I...
[289:34.39]What year is it?
[289:59.47]Okay, I saved it.
[290:01.29]You guys just took fucking three years off by life.
[290:08.73]Making me save the game.
[290:09.71]Okay.
[290:32.73]Thank you.
[291:18.80]I look scarier than the game does.
[291:53.60]Hey, that's loud.
[291:54.56]I'm gonna get lost down here.
[292:17.68]I already don't know where to go.
[292:19.94]I don't know where I am.
[292:24.78]But I do hear that.
[292:25.44]What the f- Is that a picture of a baby?
[292:34.48]Shit.
[293:00.07]It's...
[293:43.35]So,
[294:12.84]Okay.
[294:16.95]What if I just play down here like this?
[294:18.55]What was that?
[294:46.32]Did I just- Did I just find where to go without looking?
[295:03.44]Thanks, Mom.
[295:04.21]Day 1.
[295:42.79]Hello there, you must be the new transfer student from America.
[295:46.19]Ah, do you like it so far?
[295:51.75]It's okay, I guess.
[295:53.39]There are a lot of cute girls here.
[295:55.45]I miss my home.
[295:57.45]It's okay, I guess.
[295:59.69]Well, don't worry.
[296:00.63]It's sure to get better.
[296:05.42]Unless, by the way, my name is... Ume Ivtov.
[296:20.43]Ume Ivtov.
[296:21.87]It's the cool bell.
[296:25.13]Ume, oh, that's the bell.
[296:26.71]I've gotta go talk to you later.
[296:31.19]It's starting to grow on me, it's fine.
[296:34.07]It's not a caveman!
[297:04.01]Yes, Ume, my dad, lost job.
[297:06.75]And we had to move and stay with my grandparents.
[297:13.27]That's sad.
[297:15.41]At least you see your grandparents a lot.
[297:17.39]Glad to hear it.
[297:18.37]That's a sad story.
[297:20.94]Is it all bad?
[297:24.62]And after a while, I've learned how to enjoy myself here.
[297:28.64]We'll see you tomorrow.
[297:39.97]How was your second day?
[297:40.65]Have you- things gotten better yet?
[297:44.51]Everything is disgusting here.
[297:46.55]I think it's gonna be fun.
[297:49.03]And then all hearts.
[297:56.19]I think it's gonna be fun.
[297:58.48]Everything is disgusting.
[298:01.71]Everything.
[298:02.05]I think it's going to be fun.
[298:03.27]Well, okay.
[298:04.89]Anyway, today is a new day and full of new experiences.
[298:07.93]I can't wait.
[298:08.49]I almost just threw up.
[298:10.81]Because for some reason I thought I wasn't controlling this.
[298:14.24]The flies are... Can't fit anymore.
[298:17.86]What?
[298:18.36]The flies are can't fit anymore.
[298:28.40]The flies are I can't fit anymore.
[298:30.93]Yeah.
[298:31.17]Yeah.
[298:34.70]Well, class was at least interesting today.
[298:37.19]I had no idea how many perfect spirals existed in nature.
[298:41.65]You're perfect.
[298:42.95]Flirt.
[298:43.83]I thought it was boring.
[298:45.25]I've known all along.
[298:47.01]I knew the whole time.
[298:49.23]I knew all along.
[298:50.37]I like that one.
[298:53.86]Hey, do you live down this road too?
[298:55.64]Nope.
[299:03.84]Uh...
[299:05.94]Do you live down this road?
[299:09.14]Well, I live right down there at the second house on the left.
[299:12.02]It's an old house, but it's the place I call home.
[299:25.98]It's like my whole body is trying to peel apart from the inside.
[299:41.69]What the fuck is this?!
[299:45.47]Hey, what's the matter?
[299:46.19]It's so slippery, drip splash.
[299:47.79]Are you feeling alright?
[299:48.63]Yo, you doing alright?
[299:51.25]No.
[299:53.85]I like how your skin's pulling on your skull.
[299:56.35]What's this?
[299:56.94]Is it a dream?
[299:57.92]A fog.
[299:59.82]What if this isn't a dream?
[300:00.94]A fog or a lost memory?
[300:03.62]Don't be like that.
[300:04.66]What's wrong?
[300:05.32]All your water is leaking.
[300:07.20]Those eyes shine like a house fire.
[300:25.61]You are in hell.
[300:27.47]Your blood is soaking through your eyes.
[300:30.05]Don't you know?
[300:30.69]Your blood is soaking through your eyes!
[300:32.69]Is this what you wanted?
[300:34.65]In-erderer?
[300:38.16]Mo-murderer!
[300:42.48]You wanted to be, you wanted to talk, didn't you?
[300:45.75]Do you really think this is real?
[300:47.99]I'll always love you.
[300:49.65]What's wrong?
[300:50.89]I'll always love you.
[300:52.63]You are marked.
[300:55.66]Chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug, chug!
[301:00.68]Alright, alright!
[301:12.67]You wanted me to talk, didn't you?
[301:14.61]You're marked.
[301:15.73]You're marked.
[301:16.63]Your blood is soaking through your eyes.
[301:18.51]What's wrong?
[301:19.47]Your blood.
[301:20.43]Your blood.
[301:21.25]My blood.
[301:22.11]You're in hell.
[301:23.31]I'm yours.
[301:24.29]You're in hell.
[301:25.37]What's wrong?
[301:26.37]Chug, murderer.
[301:27.87]I'm yours.
[301:28.51]You wanted me to talk, didn't you?
[301:30.28]Hell.
[301:31.22]Chug.
[301:32.24]Choke.
[301:32.68]You're marked.
[301:33.90]I'm yours.
[301:34.38]Choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke.
[301:38.40]Choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke, choke.
[301:40.58]Wait.
[301:44.49]I'm not ch- I'm not choking.
[301:46.57]Right?
[301:48.77]I am not choking.
[301:51.80]I'm being called a murderer.
[301:53.66]Choke.
[301:55.66]Is this real?
[302:03.81]How do I get the fuck out of here?
[302:12.77]She's slowly disappearing.
[302:16.59]Why?
[302:17.50]What's wrong with you?
[302:18.16]I just got a text.
[302:28.38]Well, they're not there anymore.
[302:37.40]You have to play this until the batteries die.
[302:48.68]Well, if it's anything like the old game systems, like Game Gear, it'll probably be about 28 minutes.
[302:53.79]It's getting... softer.
[303:02.69]Are you guys noticing that?
[303:23.87]Okay.
[303:26.73]I've had enough of that.
[303:32.61]Oh, that was just a glitch!
[303:34.63]I had to restart the game!
[303:38.76]Alright.
[303:49.56]These are hide boxes.
[304:02.16]There's nothing else in this room.
[304:25.88]This is back at the beginning.
[304:26.84]So this is going right.
[304:30.49]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey.
[304:36.63]This is right, right.
[304:38.97]Broken.
[304:41.16]Fuck.
[304:48.11]So then this is right, left, from the entrance.
[304:52.64]This is the left door.
[305:00.92]I don't- I can't keep track of that many doors.
[305:04.34]Left, right, right, left, right, left, left, now what?
[305:07.02]Right?
[305:07.62]I don't know.
[305:08.02]I have no idea.
[305:09.59]This- this is the- is it a circle?
[305:25.35]What are you doing?
[305:32.78]What are you doing?
[305:35.38]Got isolation ward key.
[305:36.70]Run!
[305:53.35]I don't know where I'm going!
[306:02.40]We're good.
[306:03.46]I don't know, is that supposed to be hard?
[306:30.07]I was hoping it was gonna end.
[306:31.49]Just keep them coming.
[306:32.35]You can't, nobody, no human can do that for more than eight seconds.
[306:59.66]Alright, isolation room key.
[307:01.94]Now that's a fun story called where the is that?
[307:12.29]I... He said fuck.
[307:19.50]Yeah.
[307:24.30]I did.
[307:26.96]Isolation room.
[307:29.00]That's this deformity wing.
[307:31.16]That's the exit.
[307:35.48]I didn't save the game.
[307:36.05]This is about to be a monster.
[307:50.74]Why do you not have this?
[307:51.62]Why?
[307:51.90]Why?
[307:52.18]This is a PG stream?
[307:53.58]Moms don't have to leave?
[307:57.68]Well, your mother should know that we're playing a scary game, and that sometimes you get terrified.
[308:07.56]Where is he?
[308:09.84]There he is, this bag.
[308:15.66]Doesn't seem very fast.
[308:18.18]And he doesn't seem hostile.
[308:23.32]Okay, he is hostile, but he's very slow.
[308:28.59]It hurts a lot, though.
[308:35.85]Isolation.
[308:37.59]Where?
[308:37.91]It was down, right?
[308:40.13]Wasn't it down?
[308:42.05]Wasn't it down?
[308:42.77]It was down, wasn't it?
[308:48.98]I passed it.
[308:53.92]No, I didn't.
[308:55.66]No, it was down.
[308:56.20]Yeah, it was down in the morgue.
[308:58.11]So this is... incorrect.
[309:07.29]It's the one that has the blood on it.
[309:17.98]Where was that...
[309:25.38]Because there's this one.
[309:27.39]Through here.
[309:29.93]I think it's this.
[309:30.71]Yeah, it's this one right here.
[309:36.69]Down to the isolation room.
[309:39.29]Which is here we are.
[309:42.28]Okay.
[309:43.64]Open.
[309:43.98]Note.
[309:50.82]Note.
[309:52.97]It wasn't me.
[309:54.01]I swear it wasn't.
[309:55.23]It may have been my body and my hands, but I know it wasn't me.
[310:01.42]What is me?
[310:08.60]It was just my body, my hands, and my intention.
[310:14.37]But I didn't do it.
[310:16.13]It wasn't me!
[310:16.85]Yeah, that's not a really good defense.
[310:27.51]Will the defendant please rise and state what they just said in private?
[310:32.45]I stabbed him and I strangled him.
[310:36.93]And I said in my... I was like, I want to strangle you and I stabbed you.
[310:42.14]But I don't... I didn't do it, though.
[310:45.22]Somebody else did.
[310:47.58]And who is this other person?
[310:51.52]You.
[310:53.16]Your Honor.
[310:53.61]Your Honor.
[310:56.10]And then I fucking, like, ride into the camera.
[311:06.27]I found out how to stop them.
[311:07.45]You see, they are in my head and can control me for a time.
[311:10.43]But if I keep using the radiology machine to dose my head with radiation, then they go away for a while.
[311:15.76]This is fucking crazy.
[311:24.48]How big is this area?
[311:27.18]This place is huge.
[311:31.78]Another note?
[311:33.48]Oh, no.
[311:33.96]I went backwards.
[311:40.91]Sorry.
[311:41.15]I went backwards.
[311:51.20]That door is locked.
[311:52.80]Remember it.
[312:18.15]Where the hell is this?
[312:20.77]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[312:21.99]That's an alien behind me.
[312:24.35]It's an actual alien.
[312:26.15]That's an alien down here.
[312:30.26]Which way is he?
[312:31.46]I don't know if he's... Okay, he's pretty slow.
[312:36.52]Oh, no!
[312:38.12]Okay, this is where I have to go.
[312:39.90]Whoopsie!
[312:55.65]It's a goddamn maze, Peter.
[312:58.97]It's a maze, Peter.
[313:07.00]Okay, that was kind of funny.
[313:08.20]I think I got it.
[313:15.25]No.
[313:16.85]I think... I don't got it.
[313:23.55]Um, there's a bug on my head.
[313:32.58]It's just, that's, okay, that's not a rumor.
[313:35.82]That's in the game.
[313:37.70]I thought that was two rumors back to back.
[313:45.84]Well, here's the fun part.
[313:47.69]They're lost too.
[313:52.44]We both can't find each other Got it
[314:13.31]What?
[314:13.45]Exit key
[314:47.59]I have to go through the maze again?
[314:48.53]I have to go through the maze again.
[314:51.47]No I don't.
[314:54.67]Go.
[314:59.15]Bleh!
[315:35.23]Where's that exit?
[315:36.04]It's over here somewhere.
[316:22.07]I am not in control anymore.
[316:23.39]Wait.
[316:34.78]I got the bad ending.
[316:43.22]That was a bad ending.
[316:48.52]What about the weird organic material that was in the hallways?
[316:54.18]Could I not do anything with those things?
[316:57.82]Oh, that's actually the good ending.
[317:05.71]You have to beat the Game Boy game.
[317:11.40]Wait.
[317:16.78]Ghost cow.
[317:18.50]Nice work.
[317:32.15]Build your own mansion.
[317:33.33]That's gonna be fun.
[317:34.97]You're gonna be able to make your own little scary story?
[317:43.50]Don't remind him.
[317:44.50]Wait, don't remind me of what?
[317:54.30]Thanks for the reminder.
[317:57.72]Uh, alright, I think, um... Is there anything else?
[318:02.40]What does this one do?
[318:13.21]It's just actually endless mode.
[318:19.24]Holy crap.
[318:21.44]Can you imagine doing this?
[318:25.50]Past floor, like, 100.
[318:28.69]This is hard mode now, yeah.
[318:34.21]I'm sure there's somebody that has 10,000 rooms.
[318:38.04]They pause it, go to work, and come back, and shit, and they just are constantly doing it.
[318:49.74]No notes, no nothing.
[318:53.06]Yeah.
[318:55.76]Where's Otto?
[318:57.00]I will get Otto.
[318:59.94]I will.
[319:00.22]I just want to get to room 10.
[319:04.58]No, like, room 20.
[319:07.75]Just to see the first enemy.
[319:08.65]Is this some stuff that's revamped in Endless Mode?
[319:23.34]That's pretty cool.
[319:26.06]We'll see if we can see anything.
[319:27.88]Alright, here comes... somebody.
[319:31.17]Oh, we've seen this a thousand times.
[319:36.17]No 24-hour stream.
[319:37.17]Thanks, chat.
[319:45.43]There's five monsters that are exclusive to this mode.
[319:53.78]Read note.
[319:54.38]Read note!
[319:55.48]You've already heard that note!
[319:56.36]Auto is greater than a 24-hour speedrun.
[320:05.37]Wait, why does it have to be a speedrun?
[320:11.62]How do you speedrun 24-hour streams?
[320:14.54]Ah!
[320:15.90]You can see what I look like.
[320:18.52]Nobody wants that.
[320:19.36]That's a donk.
[320:26.30]That's a ding.
[320:28.20]That's a donk.
[320:29.54]Ding.
[320:30.82]Donk.
[320:32.49]Ding.
[320:34.14]Ding.
[320:35.86]Ding.
[320:37.14]Straight.
[320:37.40]Yeah.
[320:37.60]Alright, almost hit floor 20.
[320:45.13]He legit looks like 44 years old right now.
[320:50.21]I... Freaking full moon.
[321:01.55]It's a goddamn full moon.
[321:07.46]Alright, this is 420.
[321:08.26]Let's see what happens.
[321:18.39]Hmm.
[321:18.93]Looks like more of the same.
[321:20.81]But... Hold on. 25.
[321:34.54]Okay, how about this?
[321:35.46]The next time I go like... The next time I get actually just scared, it's over.
[321:59.26]What?
[322:40.95]The tooth got me!
[322:52.67]It was the tooth.
[322:55.92]It was the thing that's on the wall at every dentist office for children.
[322:59.78]They're getting... they're getting...
[323:11.72]Why is it doing this?
[323:12.80]It's just getting bloodier.
[323:19.72]No!
[323:41.39]I don't know the mechanic of this thing.
[323:47.11]He's gonna get you.
[323:49.43]Come.
[324:20.39]Something in the room?
[324:21.75]It's like I got stereo-ponic sound.
[324:27.13]Just get to 50.
[324:30.33]I'm just gonna get to 50.
[324:32.83]Once I get to 50, the stream's over when I get to 50.
[324:45.92]What?
[324:47.65]What was that?
[325:02.32]It's just like something's just breathing on me.
[325:12.57]What's wrong with me?
[325:14.67]What's wrong with me?
[325:16.21]What's wrong with my character?
[325:17.49]Where the fuck did that person go?
[325:23.89]What is th- Am I hallucinating?
[325:36.24]Get out of here!
[325:39.30]I'm getting hurt.
[325:40.18]I think I'm choking.
[325:56.61]My health is not recovering.
[325:57.97]But why?
[326:06.51]I'm too scared to incubate?
[326:15.89]What the fuck is the matter with me?
[326:23.61]Is it because I'm running?
[327:02.80]I gotta pass.
[327:09.64]I gotta pass in grade.
[327:14.97]I'll take a D. I don't know what was hurting me, though.
[327:19.19]Alright, that was fun.
[327:26.56]Yeah, that's alright.
[327:29.19]It's good.
[327:33.61]Yes, it is time for Otto.
[327:35.81]So, join us tomorrow.
[327:38.69]I was thinking about playing Darkwood after this, but I was only going to do that if this only took, like, a few hours to do.
[327:47.21]So I think this is a good time to stop.
[327:50.12]We'll be live tomorrow.
[327:52.11]Tomorrow we are going to do more Darkwood.
[327:53.95]I want to try to beat the game tomorrow, if it's possible.
[327:58.63]If... I do not beat Darkwood tomorrow... Then... I'm not gonna do five days in a row.
[328:11.41]But...
[328:14.34]I have to finish it.
[328:15.70]Whatever I do when I come back after the weekend.
[328:18.20]If I don't beat it tomorrow, then we'll just get it out of the way before I do anything else.
[328:25.78]So, I'll see you tomorrow.
[328:26.64]If you're, uh, this is kind of the end of the stream.
[328:28.70]I'm gonna go get the dog.
[328:30.19]No, I, you see, I didn't end the stream yet.
[328:32.89]So, me saying this is the end of the stream is not a 24-hour stream.
[328:35.91]The stream's still on.
[328:37.55]So, I'm gonna get Otto.
[328:38.35]I'll be right back.
[328:39.29]We're gonna say hello.
[328:41.01]And we're gonna, uh, we're gonna call it there.
[328:44.09]Perfect.
[328:45.36]I'm just gonna wind down for a little bit.
[330:59.46]I have returned with Otto.
[331:07.48]He's like smelling the microphone.
[331:15.08]Otto.
[331:19.27]I need to turn this back to here.
[331:25.99]Hello, Otto.
[331:27.07]Well, you can't see.
[331:27.93]You will in a second.
[331:30.62]Hey, Ato.
[331:32.24]What are you doing?
[331:34.06]Hey.
[331:37.96]Can you not see?
[331:39.46]Come over here, Ato.
[331:40.84]Come over this way.
[331:43.12]Come this way.
[331:44.42]He's like, I don't wanna.
[331:47.34]Oh, look at that.
[331:49.31]Here you go.
[331:50.31]Do full cam.
[331:52.21]Here you go, good boy.
[331:56.15]Say hi, Ato.
[332:00.98]He's very tired.
[332:04.44]He's so tired.
[332:06.56]He does not want to be in here.
[332:13.49]Good dog.
[332:15.39]Okay.
[332:16.37]There you go.
[332:17.07]No 24-hour stream tomorrow.
[332:19.63]In fact, let's call this here.
[332:21.99]Let me put this down.
[332:26.48]Did it work?
[332:27.34]Did it actually work this time?
[332:31.55]Does he smell?
[332:32.29]Oh yeah, he's got that sleepy dog smell.
[332:35.89]I got a lot of shit for that, by the way.
[332:41.97]Let me just put him out of the room.
[332:45.30]Give me one sec.
[333:33.55]Lazy dog.
[333:37.17]He loves lying around.
[333:39.99]He's active, too.
[333:41.99]He does a lot of running.
[333:43.67]He does the best of both worlds.
[333:47.12]Running around, going outside, and then sleeping.
[333:52.96]How old is Otto?
[333:53.64]Otto is eight, turning nine early 2020.
[334:05.80]But why is the music not playing?
[334:10.12]Is the music not playing?
[334:11.06]That's weird.
[334:12.67]It should be.
[334:19.93]Ugh.
[334:22.15]Oh.
[334:22.87]That's why.
[334:23.27]Alright.
[334:26.52]See you guys tomorrow.
[334:31.74]Did this work?
[334:33.46]come on work session top session I'm gonna try this one more time session top no why is this still pulling data wait is this real this may have happened hold on a second
[335:07.65]Now, it's still pulling from like a week and a half ago.
[335:16.69]What is this?
[335:17.35]This is a... Alright, yeah.
[335:20.17]The sub-train.
[335:22.51]Sub-train clock.
[335:26.19]What the hell does this even do?
[335:29.80]Always shows zero when inactive.
[335:36.95]Alright, well, get that shit off the screen.
[335:44.46]But anyways...
[335:46.24]Thanks, everybody, for watching.
[335:47.90]We're going to do the bits and everything.
[335:49.13]If you're new to the channel, at the end of a stream, we do a wind-down where I go over all the bit messages that were a certain threshold because I do not read messages on stream.
[336:01.43]I do not read subs or bit messages on stream unless they are of a very large denomination.
[336:09.02]And it did happen.
[336:10.42]Somebody gave 5,000 bits earlier.
[336:12.44]Somebody gave $50 earlier, and I didn't see it.
[336:16.09]I was a little too locked in to the horror game but back we had a I missed this too uh Tyler mcvicker I came in with a raid earlier so thank you appreciate that if you had a good stream if anybody was stuck around from that channel thanks a lot remember lied about Darkwood what are you talking about playing it tomorrow
[336:45.62]I said if I still had time today, I was going to move on to it.
[336:48.82]But I'm just going to play it tomorrow.
[336:49.92]What?
[336:55.93]What?
[336:58.97]Don't let Darkwood become the new Dragon's Dogma.
[337:02.21]I'm playing Darkwood tomorrow.
[337:05.70]That is the stream tomorrow.
[337:07.94]Huh?
[337:13.36]I'm going to complete Darkwood hopefully tomorrow.
[337:18.02]I don't believe you.
[337:21.63]So you admit the dragon's dogma is never happening.
[337:26.85]No, it's not.
[337:29.85]It's not.
[337:30.35]I'm sorry.
[337:30.95]Get your Pluto's out.
[337:37.29]Jerva lied about Darkwood.
[337:40.42]I said if this game took me like three or four hours, then I would play Darkwood for a few hours.
[337:48.71]But this took like almost six hours.
[337:52.11]So we're just gonna put it on tomorrow.
[337:55.11]I'm just going tomorrow.
[337:56.25]Everybody just relax.
[337:58.60]Martin had a meme.
[337:59.34]Thanks for the 250 bits.
[338:00.96]Appreciate it.
[338:03.32]I'm a big fan of the private school bully who constantly brings up how much money his dad is worth here.
[338:11.23]Get out of here.
[338:12.31]Thank you, Green Bog, for the thousand bits.
[338:16.51]Thank you.
[338:16.85]Let me tell you something very, very, very, very seriously.
[338:42.31]If you're doing something that you like, if you want to be a translator, learn Japanese, and live in Japan, go for it.
[338:50.61]Do it.
[338:56.95]Grab it by the horns and do it and go for it.
[339:10.89]There are a lot, let me tell you something.
[339:13.01]There are a lot of companies that really do look for translators and look for people to kind of be the middle person for offshore companies.
[339:26.04]Like for instance, Kim speaks fluent Vietnamese.
[339:29.26]There are a lot of opportunities for her to just be the middle woman for a Vietnamese client for different companies.
[339:39.47]It is a skill.
[339:40.63]It is a thing.
[339:41.17]Being bilingual, trilingual, that's a skill.
[339:46.79]It takes a lot to do that.
[339:48.57]To know like two or three or four languages.
[339:50.31]Fluently.
[339:50.81]Completely.
[339:56.31]So, what you're describing is potentially a real thing.
[340:03.33]Go find it.
[340:04.15]I really hope you do.
[340:06.67]Happy birthday, by the way.
[340:09.80]22 years old, you have plenty of time.
[340:13.94]You're still young.
[340:14.72]Very young.
[340:15.64]So don't worry.
[340:17.90]Do what you can.
[340:20.38]I wish you the best of luck.
[340:30.01]Take care.
[340:35.33]Stix, Renegade, thanks for the $2.50.
[340:36.75]Unfortunately, Puppagino's and D'Angelo's are beginning to close down.
[340:39.48]That's a horrible thing to hear.
[340:41.74]There's three left near me.
[340:43.06]D'Angelo's in this place, and Puppagino's here.
[340:46.82]And one more here.
[340:48.80]I miss $5 unlimited pizzas.
[340:52.15]Huh.
[340:56.75]Why is Puppagino's closing down?
[340:58.17]They had the best chain pizza I've ever had.
[341:06.28]Papagino's is disgusting.
[341:07.58]Goodbye, Omega LOL.
[341:12.76]Alright, for one second, I thought you were saying that, like, Papagino's is disgusting.
[341:22.37]Alright, goodbye, I'm gonna get banned.
[341:23.53]Like, bye, Omega LOL.
[341:28.34]Like, I gotta get this out before he bans me for saying this.
[341:36.60]Give him two minutes.
[341:40.10]That's unfortunate, though, because I really do like Pappagino's pizza.
[341:43.56]I would not choose Pappagino's over some non-chain Italian restaurants and some local pizza places.
[341:54.87]Way better.
[341:56.21]But if I had to pick a chain, Pappagino's would probably be the best one.
[342:06.19]But yeah, that's sad to hear.
[342:09.15]Thank you, Pigeon, for the $2.50.
[342:09.95]This is a thought I had in the shower.
[342:11.73]Whose customer service was or is worse, Cox or Comcast?
[342:22.82]Cox.
[342:24.82]Cox because there seems to be so many people that work for Cox and none of them talk to each other.
[342:32.96]At least with Comcast.
[342:33.94]So I had Comcast business and Cox business.
[342:37.36]And Comcast Business, when they sent somebody out, that person at least was in communication with somebody else that they needed to be in communication with to help fix a problem.
[342:51.83]The Cox support, they just, none of them talk to each other.
[342:57.03]So you have like the tech guy, the mechanic.
[343:01.05]Cox has like five character classes.
[343:04.33]The phone support.
[343:05.65]Phone.
[343:05.87]Phone.
[343:07.07]maintenance supervisor tech it's it's there's so many people sales you'll get a call from sales and all of them have no idea what the other person has just told you
[343:27.71]I would ask questions.
[343:29.79]I'm going to give you a very specific example of this.
[343:31.89]A maintenance technician told me
[343:38.47]A straight-up maintenance guy in the truck said, Hey, if you get a static IP, it actually is going to push your traffic to the front of the line, possibly, and might help out, because it's a static IP.
[343:50.05]Okay, that's really cool.
[343:51.13]Let me call and talk to somebody about getting a static IP.
[343:54.34]Hey, if I get a static IP, yeah, I want it because it's going to put my traffic potentially in the front of the line.
[344:00.08]No, it isn't.
[344:01.02]Who told you that?
[344:03.44]Um...
[344:04.96]The person in the truck?
[344:07.76]And then he would say a name.
[344:09.84]I don't know who that is.
[344:10.78]We don't know who those people are.
[344:13.34]I also asked if business lines for Cox have priority over residential.
[344:19.64]And I was told by three different fucking people, yes, no, yes.
[344:25.48]And then no by the guy in the truck.
[344:28.70]That's the problem with Cox.
[344:34.83]And half the time, it's a salesperson that just wants you to buy the product and will tell you literally, literally anything you want to hear.
[344:50.56]Yeah, business gets priority traffic and yeah, they use different parts of priority.
[344:57.09]Oh, that's awesome.
[344:58.41]Yeah, I'll take it.
[345:05.31]That sounds like a crock of bullshit.
[345:06.49]No, it is.
[345:07.09]It's stupid.
[345:08.99]It's hard to even get a question answered.
[345:12.74]If you go further than... Reset router.
[345:17.46]And... Then, if you go further than that, that person does not know what to tell you.
[345:31.43]Comcast business was... It still sucked.
[345:35.61]Don't get me wrong here.
[345:36.45]This is not... This is a contest of who made the worst pie, not who made the best pie.
[345:45.24]This is a who made the best disgusting shit pie that they shit in and then put it in the oven.
[345:53.20]It's Comcast.
[345:53.84]It's better.
[346:02.28]Damn.
[346:07.86]Yeah, it's a joke.
[346:14.68]Just make your own pie.
[346:20.65]That's... Alright.
[346:21.93]Gross.
[346:22.61]Let's go.
[346:28.61]I could sit here and talk about how much I'm not a fan of Cox and Comcast.
[346:34.78]And I've said it a thousand times for even people that might be new here.
[346:38.04]I would pay triple.
[346:40.74]If any of you guys work for Verizon, or you know somebody that works in Verizon management, tell them I would pay quadruple what they are offering right now for their fiber if I could just have it.
[347:08.47]Rich streamer.
[347:10.18]No, I don't think you understand.
[347:15.10]The Fios internet from... There was a package a while ago.
[347:20.12]I'm not sure.
[347:20.76]It might have been a promotional thing.
[347:22.54]But this shit was $39.99 for a symmetrical 35-35 connection.
[347:29.40]I think that's correct, but can I have that one?
[347:37.37]This shit was $40 a month.
[347:41.73]$35.35 is all I need.
[347:49.72]I mean, if I wanted to bump it up to, like, have a little bit more download, whatever, but still, that's really, really pretty damn good.
[347:59.59]Certain streamers have had almost as many issues on Verizon, but was it Fiber?
[348:03.39]Was it Verizon Fios?
[348:05.03]To the home.
[348:07.68]Verizon, DSL, and whatever internet probably sucks asshole.
[348:13.39]Their fiber connection is, from my understanding, it's one of the best connections in the country.
[348:36.29]Well, Fiverr is a dedicated line.
[348:37.66]Yeah, well, that's what I mean.
[348:42.28]Fios is amazing.
[348:43.36]Only thing I miss from DC.
[348:47.12]My family has Fios.
[348:48.06]It's amazing.
[348:49.67]Yeah.
[348:50.43]Tell the pistachio ice cream story again.
[348:58.61]Fios in DC is amazing.
[348:59.95]That's all I hear.
[349:01.34]All I hear is, yeah, Fios is just incredible.
[349:03.22]Fios is like the best.
[349:05.79]I actually, um, the guy that's been producing a lot of the events and who will continue to, um, for the streams and stuff, said that he had Fios as well.
[349:18.94]And he told me that over, I believe it was two years...
[349:23.40]The connection went down once, and it was because it was a scheduled maintenance for, like, four hours.
[349:31.38]They just were, like, upgrading the network, and it's the only time it ever went down in two years.
[349:36.33]And I'm just sitting there going, just, Verizon, like, just... And then, and here's the sad part of this, Verizon recently has decided that they're pulling out of the West Coast.
[349:48.52]Verizon is not going to expand anymore.
[349:51.32]They're pulling out of the West Coast.
[349:52.52]I believe they sold off all their stuff to a couple of other companies out here.
[349:57.12]Somebody correct me if I'm wrong.
[350:04.68]To Frontier.
[350:05.90]I think that's right.
[350:08.18]They sold off all their stuff to Frontier.
[350:10.64]It's taken them.
[350:11.08]Yep.
[350:11.60]See?
[350:13.09]That's just so sad.
[350:20.71]But the good thing is I will be on an actual fiber connection in a couple months.
[350:28.66]Depending.
[350:33.56]Nope, I'm staying in Vegas.
[350:35.30]Not going back to Boston.
[350:42.13]He's going back.
[350:47.70]And I have asked, and it is true fiber.
[350:50.24]It's not one of those fiber to the neighborhood and then copper to the street and then copper to the house and then coaxial to your modem.
[351:01.47]No, no, no, no.
[351:02.21]This is the real deal.
[351:14.01]What the hell is this?
[351:14.73]Suppose that United Bank offers to lend you $10,000 for one year at a nominal annual rate of 8%, but you must make interest payments at the end of each quarter and then pay off the $10,000 principal amount for the end of the year.
[351:27.54]What is the effective annual rate on the loan?
[351:29.76]I don't care.
[351:40.35]Somebody will answer that for you, apparently.
[351:42.11]I don't know.
[351:42.41]It's not going to be me.
[351:45.58]Don't do the math homework.
[351:46.64]Except for cupcakes that jump in your screen.
[351:49.34]I actually was looking into that one.
[351:50.90]There are another three or four horror games that I want to play.
[351:56.21]Some of them are a little less polished than others.
[352:14.40]But I was looking at that one as well.
[352:18.24]ShittyViewBot is the one that gave 5,000 bits earlier.
[352:23.77]A long time ago.
[352:27.07]$50 from ShittyViewBot.
[352:29.95]And they say, because you know the correct flavors of ice cream and you produce some good streams, I guess.
[352:38.76]Always nice to see a fellow smooth strawberry lover.
[352:45.15]It's always good to see that there's other people out there that are really are into the whole smooth strawberry.
[352:57.99]Good stuff.
[353:01.43]You gotta spit pistachios like watermelon seeds.
[353:03.63]No, pistachios are good.
[353:05.92]But I just don't like to eat them.
[353:10.40]Thank you to Freudian Weapon for the 750 bits.
[353:14.21]Happy Thursday.
[353:15.69]It's always hilarious watching you get scared playing games.
[353:17.81]Not at the cost of your health, though, so take care of yourself.
[353:21.07]Random question.
[353:21.79]What do you think was your worst ever Halloween costume?
[353:25.29]I told this story before, but I was going to be a Power Ranger.
[353:27.53]I was going to be the Red Ranger.
[353:30.30]And you know, back when in middle school, everybody gets up from their seat and walks to every other classroom around in a circle with their costume on.
[353:43.47]And it was a huge deal.
[353:45.33]That was your time to shine.
[353:48.92]I forgot to wear my costume.
[353:50.38]I forgot to pack it.
[353:52.76]My memory cannot piece together the reason why I didn't have it.
[353:56.12]But I forgot it somehow.
[353:57.23]It was in a bag on a counter and I didn't take it.
[354:00.15]Or I didn't have that.
[354:00.91]There was some reason why.
[354:03.41]and I didn't have a costume and I felt really bad about it and one of my teachers at the time don't know what her name was but god bless her soul because she pulled me out of the class and said hey because you know I mean I'm upset I wanted to be the red ranger hey okay I can do something for you here do you um hold on hold on and she she went she got construction paper
[354:27.87]and she cut with red construction paper like a ladybug vest and like ladybug ears and she said here you go you can be a ladybug and I didn't have the heart to tell her this is the worst thing I have ever seen and I want nothing more than to not ever wear this
[354:56.47]So I put it on.
[354:57.01]And then I walked around as the ladybug made out of construction paper.
[355:06.42]While a few of my friends were all the other Power Rangers.
[355:17.08]And then, obviously, even younger me appreciated it.
[355:22.17]And I was like, I don't... Thank you.
[355:25.01]Yeah, thank you.
[355:26.83]And then years later, obviously, I look back and... That's... That was, like, so nice.
[355:33.82]Just trying to make that kid happy, you know?
[355:38.58]Don't remember what their name was, though.
[355:42.74]You should still say, I'm the Red Ranger.
[355:50.72]Hold on, I gotta take care of something real quick.
[355:56.67]Uh... Why can I not purge this comment?
[356:03.17]Did I lose... I can't purge that comment.
[356:05.99]Somebody said, uh... BCP.
[356:10.28]Just in all lowercase, just trying to fucking get me going.
[356:17.31]Uh, then we had 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12... $12 from somebody whose name is... a bunch of numbers.
[356:26.40]1, 6, 8, 2, 4, 7, 1, 6, 2, 600, 5, 2, 6, 5, 6, 7, 4, 5, 2... That's a very large number username.
[356:41.51]And they just did Q, R, S. Or Q, R, Wailord.
[356:47.35]And then jermaSour.
[356:53.39]Alright.
[356:55.45]They didn't even put the S. Thank you, Mossline, for the 500 bits.
[357:00.38]Use this money to buy a silly straw to replace your boring straw.
[357:03.76]Okay.
[357:06.48]Alright.
[357:07.74]Sure.
[357:13.70]We also had... I'll do it.
[357:17.40]We also had Superintendent Chalmers gave 250 bits.
[357:22.07]They say, here's an emote concept for Jerma Ceres.
[357:29.65]Planet?
[357:39.70]For a planet.
[357:41.10]Is this a
[358:07.92]I think planets are going to take a little bit of a vacation here.
[358:10.58]I don't think we're going to add any more planets.
[358:14.30]Not for a while.
[358:15.80]There's a bunch of other things I think we should be there instead.
[358:21.70]But I do appreciate it.
[358:22.44]Thank you.
[358:24.82]Thank you for the emote concept.
[358:29.49]Freddy Dredd gave 2,000 bits.
[358:34.13]Thank you, Freddy.
[358:36.31]Appreciate the 2,000.
[358:38.05]20 bucks.
[358:40.91]No message, just 2,000.
[358:46.21]Also, Rogue of MV gave 3,000 bits.
[358:53.23]Thank you, Rogue MV, for that large money drop.
[358:59.37]Thank you.
[358:59.69]They say, really been enjoying the Darkwood streams over the last couple of days.
[359:02.09]They've been super comfy, and listening to them has helped me get through a rough week at work.
[359:06.97]Keep being awesome.
[359:10.62]We continue tomorrow.
[359:13.20]Thank you so much for the $30, 3,000 bits.
[359:15.78]It means a lot.
[359:19.58]If you're working tomorrow, we'll be back in it.
[359:25.83]Really appreciate that, though.
[359:27.49]Jizu gave five community subs.
[359:30.89]Thank you, Jizu.
[359:33.19]Balla Koala.
[359:34.41]Back-to-back 2500 bits.
[359:35.89]50 bits.
[359:38.53]No, 5000 bits.
[359:40.67]Which totals $50.
[359:42.92]From Balla Koala and their messages.
[359:45.66]jermaSour, finger pointing down.
[359:47.30]jermaSour, finger pointing up.
[359:54.16]But thank you for the 5000 bits, Balla Koala.
[360:00.62]Appreciate it.
[360:02.08]Sour Tower.
[360:03.67]What is it called?
[360:05.05]Sour Tower.
[360:06.97]Did you guys coin that phrase?
[360:10.57]That's not bad.
[360:14.01]That's not bad.
[360:24.20]Time to clean this up.
[360:27.80]Hey Gnarly, thanks for the $2.50.
[360:30.49]This game reminds me of a less quotable Clocktower 3.
[360:33.01]Also, Otto.
[360:37.08]Some of that did remind me.
[360:38.18]Especially the guy with the scythe.
[360:40.24]I think that was probably supposed to be inspired by Clocktower.
[360:44.90]Seems like it in that mansion.
[360:48.39]Balla Koala, thanks for the 500 bits.
[360:50.21]Top Dono.
[360:51.87]Dab.
[360:52.33]Alright, there you go.
[360:57.66]Top Dono.
[361:02.12]It is time... To roll the credits.
[361:07.84]All the subs, thanks everybody.
[361:13.91]Thanks again for supporting the stream.
[361:15.93]As always.
[361:24.01]There are a lot of you.
[361:27.33]Do you see your name up there?
[361:30.09]If you subscribe during this stream, you will.
[361:36.53]Thank you, though.
[361:40.60]Almost to the end, we have a few more bits to do.
[361:42.80]We have 250 bits from Snoozencopter.
[361:46.62]Thank you, Snoozencopter.
[361:48.12]They say, hey, did you see my new badge?
[361:50.78]Apparently, I'm one of the first 25 people that subscribe to you.
[361:54.36]I'm officially a Jerma veteran now.
[361:57.35]Oh yeah, they added that, right?
[361:59.11]They added that.
[362:01.37]25.
[362:05.19]Anyway, I forgot if I wanted to say something interesting or if I just wanted to brag.
[362:09.10]Oh yeah, if this badge is customizable, you think you're going to do something with it.
[362:12.26]Like a golden Jerm or something.
[362:14.38]Also, my wounds are almost completely healed, so I'm fine again.
[362:16.92]Can you believe you're almost 40?
[362:18.97]In six more years, maybe.
[362:20.97]But glad to hear that after that horrible, horrible accident,
[362:27.95]I'm glad you're doing good.
[362:28.65]I remember you talking about that before.
[362:31.93]That's scary shit.
[362:32.73]Glad you're doing good.
[362:39.66]But, yeah, the first 25 people that ever subscribed to this channel have a special badge now.
[362:46.44]I don't know, I don't think they're customizable.
[362:48.51]At least not yet.
[362:55.27]But yeah, that's a long time.
[362:57.13]If you subbed the first 25 people, and you're still here, that's really awesome.
[363:08.80]It's a founder.
[363:12.10]One of the original 25 founders.
[363:15.20]Oh, I see it.
[363:15.72]There it is.
[363:17.42]Founder.
[363:18.02]42 month subscriber.
[363:20.26]Holy shit.
[363:21.22]There it is.
[363:25.32]Awesome.
[363:27.12]Thanks again.
[363:31.69]And now it's weird knowing that I'm almost 40.
[363:33.27]It's true.
[363:36.13]42 months.
[363:39.85]We also had 500 bits from Flugboy.
[363:46.81]They say, they say, here's some bits, Jerm, hope you're doing well.
[363:53.12]Thank you.
[363:55.35]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[363:57.25]They also say, uh, hey, I just wanted to publicly call out Styx Renegade for committing a sin by playing Megalovania on a child's piano.
[364:05.64]Hope you have a good night.
[364:08.92]On a... What?
[364:12.96]Like one of those little Sesame Street pianos?
[364:19.66]How do you even do that?
[364:20.44]There's not even enough keys.
[364:21.36]There's like seven keys on those things.
[364:28.57]But thank you, Flugboy, for the 500 bits.
[364:33.13]I told you I would.
[364:34.27]Uh-oh.
[364:36.69]Getting called out.
[364:39.61]Hey, Cat Attack, thanks for the 300 bits.
[364:41.37]Thanks for showing auto.
[364:42.19]I'm living away from home and miss my senior dachshund terribly.
[364:45.49]They're great dogs.
[364:46.23]They are the best dogs.
[364:48.01]That is why I've had a dachshund back-to-back.
[364:52.78]And I probably will do it again.
[364:55.22]They are my favorite dogs.
[365:00.16]Sorry to hear that you're living so far away from your baby.
[365:05.47]Thank you for the three bucks.
[365:06.69]Appreciate it.
[365:09.27]Thank you, Flugboy, for the 500 bits.
[365:10.71]I work part-time at an ice cream parlor and we have soft strawberry.
[365:13.45]It's the best.
[365:14.45]Can I send you a quart of it?
[365:15.73]Please say yes.
[365:17.95]I don't accept anything in the mail.
[365:20.32]I don't have a P.O.
[365:20.90]box.
[365:23.24]Maybe I will have a P.O.
[365:24.56]box in like a decade.
[365:28.30]And that means no.
[365:31.20]Send ice cream in the mail.
[365:33.28]What you mean to say is, can I send you flavored milk?
[365:40.09]But no, I don't have any plans ever to do any type of send me stuff.
[365:46.31]Like P.O.
[365:46.81]Box or anything.
[365:47.47]P.O.
[365:47.69]Box is free content.
[365:49.75]It's that I... You guys realize that P.O.
[365:53.25]Box, wherever it is...
[365:55.59]It would get so full, and I would not keep up with it, and I would get calls from this post office saying, Hey, dickhead, you have a PO box here.
[366:08.64]You have boxes here that are taking up the whole room.
[366:14.27]We don't have room for any of this stuff.
[366:17.03]You need to come get this stuff.
[366:24.65]Honestly, just completely honest.
[366:26.39]It's just something I just don't really want to keep up with.
[366:30.45]Because it's hard enough to do anything else.
[366:36.25]Just my complete honest opinion on it.
[366:39.85]But, thank you.
[366:40.94]For the milk.
[366:42.28]Potentially.
[366:44.35]Thank you, Permanent Marks, for the 300 bits.
[366:46.09]I'll buy you another Sonic Corn Dog if you let my family go.
[366:49.57]Well, that's... I know this is fake because Sonic Corn Dogs are gross.
[366:53.65]And I would never order one.
[366:55.31]So you're implying that I've eaten one already.
[366:56.99]That's how you know that's a lie.
[367:13.10]How do I know?
[367:13.64]Because I've had Sonic before.
[367:15.52]I've had... I've eaten all this... I've eaten Sonic a few times.
[367:19.95]And every time I just go... I should have just went to Wendy's.
[367:28.71]I've been told you don't order food from Sonic.
[367:31.55]You order the drinks from Sonic.
[367:33.31]And like, wow, you're doing it wrong.
[367:35.09]You're ordering food from Sonic, doing it wrong.
[367:45.91]Sonic has good burgers, though.
[367:47.05]I've never had a Sonic burger.
[367:48.13]I've had a bunch of their other stuff that was not very good.
[367:55.53]Fuck you, Jeremy Sonic.
[367:56.81]My own girlfriend is in here.
[367:59.31]Fuck you, Jeremy Sonic is great.
[368:04.83]Oh my god.
[368:08.75]Sonic Tater Tots are good.
[368:10.45]Every time... Alright, and when I say every time, I mean the two times that I've been to Sonic and ordered those items.
[368:18.37]The Cheddar Tater Tots were cold, soggy, and unappetizing.
[368:26.24]They all came up at once.
[368:30.36]When you picked up one Tater Tot, all 30 of them came up at the same time.
[368:36.70]They were like shitty nachos.
[368:46.85]I used to work there, and I wouldn't trust the drinks either, to be honest.
[368:58.86]Now... Look, if you put a blindfold on me, and you put me in a car, and you said, We're gonna go get food!
[369:05.10]I'm not telling you where!
[369:06.29]Oh, okay!
[369:08.45]And you drove, and you took the blindfold off, and we were in a Sonic parking lot...
[369:13.37]Okay.
[369:15.07]Sure.
[369:15.99]I'll eat here.
[369:17.65]But I'm not going to go out of my way to go do a Sonic.
[369:21.84]Ever.
[369:22.50]Again.
[369:28.64]I would eat it.
[369:29.42]And I'd be like, alright, I ate it.
[369:31.00]That was alright.
[369:31.60]That was okay.
[369:32.41]I guess it was kind of... It's good.
[369:34.67]Whatever.
[369:35.25]It's food.
[369:35.95]It's worth it, I guess.
[369:41.41]Otto is sleepy and sloppy and loves tater tots.
[369:47.03]You're like speaking... Anyways, thank you... Thank you, Spooky Spitfire, for the $2.50.
[370:04.38]Jerm, I literally got her right at the end of the stream when you were showing Otto, so it was worth it.
[370:09.44]Also, I just got to the old Hunter's DLC, and there is a Boomhammer Hunter with more health than the Cleric Beast, and I don't know how to feel about that.
[370:19.87]It's tough.
[370:23.25]That first area in the DLC, those guys are no joke.
[370:31.45]Bloodborne's DLC, by the way, is the best DLC of any video game that's ever been made.
[370:36.69]It is the best.
[370:37.61]There's one or two small missteps, but DLC is a misstep by a design choice.
[370:45.26]So, come on.
[370:54.34]But... What's wrong?
[371:00.75]Well, what it is, is it's adding... Here, listen.
[371:04.27]You make a video game and you add DLC.
[371:06.57]Okay, fine.
[371:07.97]But a lot of times that DLC ends up costing almost as much as the original game did.
[371:13.19]For... 70 to 80% less content.
[371:22.97]You'll spend like 30, 40 bucks sometimes on some of these DLCs.
[371:27.25]And it doesn't add as much as you played already in the base game.
[371:32.42]But you're paying for nearly like 60, 70, sometimes like 75% of the base game.
[371:39.22]That's kind of... Like... I guess.
[371:46.47]Now... DLC, I think, is also another one of those things that... It has to exist.
[371:53.41]Because if you make something that people really like... You want to do more of that thing for the people that really like it.
[372:06.31]And it gives you a reason to go back and play that, especially in a single-player sense.
[372:11.75]Gives you a reason to go back and play it again and experience some new stuff.
[372:18.83]The Sims games cost like $500 for the full experience.
[372:23.79]And Train Simulator is like $2,000.
[372:25.61]Wasn't there a calculation one time?
[372:38.60]It's 7,000.
[372:39.04]No, it's not.
[372:44.93]It's not 7 grand.
[372:50.67]But I- I enjoy DLC.
[372:52.50]It's just sometimes you'll- There's no standard of how long or what needs to be added for DLC.
[372:59.38]So that's why it gets weird.
[373:01.78]Because- Oh, buy the season pass.
[373:04.19]Alright, I bought the season pass.
[373:05.81]You get everything for $40.
[373:06.71]Cool.
[373:10.46]But what if you don't do, like, a season pass?
[373:12.20]What if you just buy... I want this, just this single thing that you came out with now.
[373:16.30]Oh, well, that's $25.
[373:18.06]Okay, well, it's an hour long.
[373:23.31]When are we gonna get the Jerma DLC?
[373:29.68]It's coming out.
[373:36.83]I'm not anti-DLC.
[373:39.27]I'm just, like, what do I get for this?
[373:42.65]And sometimes season passes are so vague, you really don't even know what the hell you're buying.
[373:47.31]You're buying a thing that you don't even know what exists yet.
[373:50.97]It's not even like pre-ordering.
[373:52.11]Pre-ordering game, when you pre-order a game, you know what the game is that you're gonna buy.
[373:56.80]At least.
[373:58.54]When you buy a season pass, it's just, hey, something gonna show up here.
[374:07.08]You don't even know what it is.
[374:18.85]And, you know, here's another part of this.
[374:20.93]If you buy Season Pass for a game, and that content comes out like six, seven, eight months later, almost probably a year later, what if you don't even play the game anymore?
[374:30.22]What if you don't even know?
[374:31.70]You don't even pay attention anymore.
[374:33.18]Yeah, I want that Season Pass.
[374:35.61]Like a year and eight months goes by, and all of a sudden you like, you forgot that the game even came out.
[374:49.44]That happens, that happens, that happens pretty often, I'm sure.
[374:52.22]Well, maybe, maybe.
[374:53.24]That happened to me with Borderlands.
[375:00.10]Yeah, I mean, good, look, good content is good content.
[375:04.47]I will gladly pay like I have many times for DLC.
[375:12.45]But by its very nature, it's... It can be sort of predatory in a way.
[375:20.20]It's like promising something that doesn't exist yet.
[375:23.52]Especially if you sell a season pass.
[375:26.12]Season pass is what I have the issue with, not like actual DLC packages that come out.
[375:46.60]It's inherently predatory.
[375:47.62]It's just that some DLC is actually good.
[375:50.12]Yeah, and there are a lot of companies that do put a lot of time into it.
[375:53.05]They really do.
[375:57.01]But where there is a yin, there is a yang.
[376:06.65]As they say.
[376:09.31]But... We are... No, we're not.
[376:13.35]I thought we were done.
[376:13.87]We're not done.
[376:24.73]All DLCs should be free.
[376:27.65]See, I disagree with that, because how do you pay the people that made it?
[376:33.45]You know, people that made the DLC, they have to, I mean, like the concept artists, the people that made the dungeons, the people that do the character design, the 3D modelers, the programmers, like, these people aren't working for free.
[376:56.48]Imagine paying for games.
[376:57.74]Now they get paid by a contractual basis?
[377:06.27]I am not... I'm not going to speak on how this works in the games industry because I have no idea.
[377:13.77]And I don't want to be one of those people that gives you spitballs a bunch of shit that's just not true.
[377:18.27]So, I don't know.
[377:23.94]But thank you for the 300 bits from Hannah has bits.
[377:29.60]Hannah has a bits.
[377:31.94]There you go.
[377:35.53]See, I don't know if I'm cheering right.
[377:37.63]This is the first time I've done it.
[377:41.36]Well, I'll give you two parts to this.
[377:43.98]If you are having a really, really hard time,
[378:10.13]And me simply saying that it's going to be okay is going to be enough for you.
[378:19.53]I really just want to make sure you understand that that might not be correct.
[378:26.78]And you should try to figure out what's going on and also maybe seek some actual potential professional help.
[378:37.47]Because it's very easy for me to do that.
[378:39.95]You know what I mean?
[378:43.34]But I want to make sure that you're okay.
[378:46.72]That you are okay.
[378:48.48]And me simply saying those words is not necessarily a magic wand to do so.
[379:00.69]And no, you're not trying to be weird.
[379:02.95]It's not.
[379:03.51]It's not weird.
[379:06.60]Just make sure you're doing the necessary things to make yourself feel better and get better.
[379:25.04]You've been following the channel for a long time.
[379:30.72]So obviously, I don't want people that are following this channel and that say stuff like this sometimes.
[379:37.28]I don't want you to feel terrible.
[379:38.50]I don't want you to feel bad.
[379:39.46]I want you to feel like everything's going to be okay.
[379:44.61]But just be careful putting essentially that power over here.
[379:51.47]Because I might not actually have that kind of power.
[379:55.41]And me telling you that might... You know what I'm saying?
[379:58.13]It's a weird scenario where
[380:01.88]I might not have that power.
[380:08.01]But please, please, please follow up with this if you really are having a problem and a hard time.
[380:16.23]Talk to the people that can really help with that.
[380:23.46]I wish you the best.
[380:25.08]Much love to you.
[380:26.36]Take care of yourself.
[380:30.87]I'm sorry that you're not having a great time.
[380:34.09]But I will also say this was a two-parter when I said this part here.
[380:38.61]Well, I haven't said it, but I'm about to.
[380:42.31]Regardless of that, if it does make you happy and staying here and hanging out here makes you feel better, that's good.
[380:51.88]And I'm really happy to hear that.
[380:55.30]But that should only be a piece.
[380:57.42]A small piece of that puzzle.
[381:09.69]Thank you so much for your 300 bits, your $3.
[381:15.07]I wish you the best and please take care of yourself.
[381:19.81]Take care.
[381:25.03]Moving on from that, we have 500 bits.
[381:29.79]From Super, or Super Tentorium.
[381:33.67]Super Tentorium, thanks for the five dollars here.
[381:37.42]This is my cordial request for you to play Kerbal Space Program.
[381:40.24]I loaded up Kerbal Space Program and could not figure out anything in the first 30 seconds and realized that this was, I was never going to learn and I exited the game.
[381:52.33]In fact, I can tell you, I mean, I'm embellishing, right?
[381:55.09]So let's see how much time I have in Kerbal Space Program.
[382:01.52]Kerbal Space Program.
[382:03.04]Let's go to Games on Steam.
[382:08.64]L, M, N, O, P, K. There it is.
[382:12.92]Okay.
[382:16.44]So I have... 20 minutes in Kerbal Space Program.
[382:24.99]And probably 7 or 8 of those minutes we're doing menu stuff.
[382:30.07]I probably only have about 12 to 13 minutes actually trying to make anything.
[382:34.15]That's embarrassing.
[382:35.03]I'm just told I'm being open with you.
[382:40.07]He stopped before QRS.
[382:43.53]Yeah.
[382:44.67]So I'm not going to play Kerbal Space.
[382:46.50]There's plenty of people that do great, hilarious, fun content with that game.
[382:50.24]You've probably seen it a bunch before.
[382:52.58]You would be very... You'd be so irritated watching that stream.
[382:56.60]I wouldn't be able to do it.
[382:57.80]I tried.
[382:58.36]I put 10 minutes...
[383:01.04]I put 10, I gave it 12 minutes.
[383:03.56]So, you know, I gave it a shot.
[383:07.84]Thank you.
[383:10.09]Also, DeathGamer, thanks for the 250.
[383:12.05]Hey, Jerma, I was wondering what happened to the Modern Warfare 3 Grandpa vids.
[383:15.25]Do you still have them or are they gone forever?
[383:17.65]That is a Machinima problem.
[383:20.59]Machinima, I made those videos for Machinima.
[383:24.05]So, I was essentially contracted out by Machinima to have them put them on Machinima Respawn.
[383:31.64]And then they just privated all of them for seemingly no reason.
[383:36.48]And then Machinima has now been completely liquidated as a company.
[383:40.47]They don't exist anymore.
[383:42.19]And those videos are gone.
[383:51.07]Yeah.
[383:53.00]So, I do not have access to those videos.
[383:56.74]They are potentially gone forever.
[383:59.26]In fact, I think they are gone forever.
[384:06.19]Which is too bad, because that's really where I got my actual start.
[384:12.29]Kind of gaining in viewership and having a channel that was more, you know, comedy-oriented.
[384:18.52]That first, like, grandpa video did so much.
[384:21.72]Like, that... I did, like, 12 episodes.
[384:24.10]That did so much for my channel.
[384:29.56]That is kind of a shame that they're just gone forever.
[384:37.66]But I'm not... My YouTube channels are not under contract with Machinima anymore.
[384:47.64]So, I have no connection to them at all.
[384:55.59]Yes, there are still a few on my channel.
[384:57.27]I still have, like... Maybe three?
[385:00.59]I think there's two or three that I uploaded.
[385:06.35]Even though you really weren't supposed to.
[385:07.55]I kind of got a pass on a couple of them, I think, because they were... I don't know why, but I know you weren't really supposed to do that.
[385:21.06]But I do not have access to them currently, no.
[385:23.94]That is two or three computers ago.
[385:27.36]And those hard drives I've brought along with me...
[385:32.34]But then they weren't worth putting in the new computers.
[385:36.54]Two computers from that computer, I didn't keep them anymore.
[385:41.25]And they were hard disk drives.
[385:42.77]I went to full solid state.
[385:44.35]Those hard drives kind of ran out of gas and I didn't really want to use them anymore.
[385:50.48]So they're just kind of gone.
[385:54.72]But thank you, Dorkube, for the 250 bits.
[385:56.44]I was thinking today about how this community is the first one I've ever actively participated in.
[386:00.56]And how I have made some friends for life here.
[386:03.62]And I'm still looking forward to the day I meet an in-real-life Germamite.
[386:08.01]Anyways, will we get some BF Bugleberry content for Halloween?
[386:26.63]I don't know.
[386:27.01]I don't know.
[386:31.85]Ask me again.
[386:34.01]Ask me again in a week.
[386:42.75]Right now, right now, I have my, I'm biting my bottom lip and I'm raising my eyebrows like, uh-huh.
[386:53.85]We'll see.
[386:55.46]But, yeah, I'm glad people can make friends here.
[386:59.26]Discord's open to the public if you feel like just chilling.
[387:03.36]Playing games with some people, hanging out, talking about whatever.
[387:06.99]Just keep it civil.
[387:08.27]That's all I ask.
[387:11.95]Spooky Spitfire thanks to the 250.
[387:13.39]Jerma forgot to mention that there is a new Souls game being made.
[387:15.83]Ooh, it's Elden Ring is what you're talking about.
[387:19.77]Uh, it's potentially open world with more build diversity and all that fun stuff even more than Dark Souls.
[387:25.37]Oh yeah, I'll be playing that day one.
[387:29.30]George R.R.
[387:29.76]Martin is involved in that project.
[387:32.48]He believes he's probably making the game world.
[387:34.80]He's writing the characters probably or creating the world.
[387:37.32]I don't know what his involvement is.
[387:39.88]But that's gonna be day one.
[387:41.44]Like, just like Sekiro was.
[387:47.46]And then finally, we had Slumpy Stumps.
[387:49.24]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[387:51.48]Thank you.
[387:53.46]Thanks for all the laughs.
[387:54.26]No other online personality has given me so much free laughs and entertainment as you.
[387:58.65]Been watching and laughing since high school and hope to continue doing for years to come.
[388:03.09]Love you, man.
[388:05.75]Thank you.
[388:07.81]Thank you for the $5, 500 bits.
[388:12.40]I hope you still feel that way years from now.
[388:14.56]I hope you still feel that way tomorrow.
[388:20.43]I'm glad you still do.
[388:21.95]Thank you.
[388:30.92]And finally, 420Squid right now just came in with 1000 bits.
[388:34.68]$10 for 420Squid.
[388:38.08]Here's a handful of bits for a hole-in-one streamer.
[388:42.08]Thank you.
[388:43.02]Also, the janitor was mocking my reactions throughout the entire stream.
[388:46.26]Maybe consider legal action.
[388:57.77]The janitor He cleans this he's just he ever fit people keep throwing the tomato and throwing popcorn and shit Can you guys just keep the food on your laps, please?
[389:18.74]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[389:19.50]We're going to do Darkwood.
[389:20.80]See if we can complete it.
[389:21.80]If we don't complete it in like that five to seven hour-ish time frame, then once I get back from taking a few days off for the weekend, I will be back and we'll do it there.
[389:36.01]We'll finish it.
[389:36.93]I promise.
[389:37.87]I'm not going to get to the 95% completion of a game and not do it.
[389:42.98]This ain't like Hollow Knight.
[389:45.40]I beat like six bosses in Hollow Knight and didn't play it anymore.
[389:48.38]This would be like as if I beat 30 bosses in Hollow Knight and didn't play it anymore.
[389:53.73]Not the same.
[389:59.87]Anywho.
[390:01.43]Good night, everybody.
[390:03.53]We'll see you tomorrow.
[390:07.20]Take care.
