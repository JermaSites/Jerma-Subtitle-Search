[ve:60.16.100]

[00:01.13]Yeah, it was exactly on time.
[00:03.83]To the second.
[00:05.61]Right in the window, I'm telling you.
[00:06.83]I'm not going to miss that window.
[00:10.03]Ow.
[00:11.01]My desk.
[00:13.57]This controller is so dirty.
[00:17.73]I want to kind of show this to you guys.
[00:21.09]This is the controller I've been using the whole time.
[00:22.75]This is embarrassing, though.
[00:23.98]I'm not sure I wanted you to see this.
[00:30.83]This is... disgusting.
[00:34.61]For some reason, I feel like this is gonna break Terms of Service.
[00:37.63]I feel like this is gonna break Terms of Service.
[00:40.23]It's so gross.
[00:42.65]This is the gamepad equivalent of showing... like, my asshole on stream.
[00:55.16]I need to clean this.
[00:56.04]This is the problem.
[00:56.78]This is dirty keybindings, dirty keys, dirty buttons.
[01:02.96]This is FILTHY.
[01:04.19]This is the reason why we couldn't beat the fucking guy last night?
[01:12.31]Do I have any alcohol wipes?
[01:15.85]No.
[01:16.19]I'm gonna furiously clean this at some point.
[01:21.59]But, uh, we are going to, tonight, try our very hardest, and relax, and try to get to the end of Sekiro.
[01:31.56]Tonight.
[01:33.09]I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[01:34.31]I'm going to try to be laser lightning focused.
[01:39.67]Don't get mad this stream.
[01:41.27]That's asking a lot.
[01:51.34]Here comes rage.
[01:52.46]I haven't been raging.
[01:54.98]Alright.
[01:55.70]I've been upset.
[01:57.86]There's a difference.
[02:03.06]Yes, you have.
[02:05.20]No, I have not.
[02:11.56]There's a difference between agitated and rage.
[02:19.38]What about the headless?
[02:20.88]Well, that was another... I was going to a different dimension.
[02:24.32]That's not anger.
[02:26.38]My soul got ripped out of my body and got put in a parallel universe.
[02:31.35]How am I supposed to be mad at that?
[02:32.91]It just kind of was happening.
[02:35.63]Hysterical is a good way to put it, yeah.
[02:42.36]Dermot, you've outpaced me so much.
[02:43.76]I haven't been able to even get to Fountainhead Palace yet.
[02:46.10]Stop being good.
[02:51.62]No, just do it at your own pace.
[02:54.05]There's no... There's no correct way.
[02:57.45]Don't let anybody tell you.
[02:58.63]Don't let any elitist video gamer tell you.
[03:02.06]That you're doing it wrong.
[03:03.10]You gotta go faster.
[03:04.26]No, do it at your own pace.
[03:09.44]Don't have somebody go over your shoulder and go, Hey man, you should have killed that thing already.
[03:16.21]Just fly.
[03:23.65]Don't listen to them.
[03:27.28]This is a game that's meant to be taken slow and seriously.
[03:39.21]Like for instance, this guy beats Owl and Genichiro first try but dies to Headless and then they laughed three times.
[03:45.41]That's three separate laughs.
[03:48.31]That's alright though.
[03:55.19]Skip everything?
[03:56.07]We spent a significant portion of last night's stream making sure that I saw all the things that the game had to offer.
[04:05.06]I went back yesterday.
[04:06.54]I st- Skipped?
[04:10.22]We went back for like six hours!
[04:13.93]To like do optional content!
[04:17.06]Oh, you guys are just giving it to me right now.
[04:20.00]And just wait till I get even angrier in about 30.
[04:22.64]I'm not gonna get angry today.
[04:23.98]I'm gonna be positive today.
[04:25.61]We're just gonna talk about how positive everything is.
[04:27.57]It's gonna be fantastic.
[04:31.23]Even if I die.
[04:31.97]Even if I look over here and I see people, like, making fun of me.
[04:35.41]Which, that's not very nice.
[04:37.09]Okay?
[04:38.37]It's not very nice.
[04:40.54]When I see die to tutorial boss, I'm trying.
[04:43.78]That's not a nice thing to see.
[04:49.80]I'm just kidding.
[04:52.59]Anyways, let's go.
[04:59.39]Moral of the story is you're not supposed to beat the game first try.
[05:05.23]You're supposed to persevere and get ready and I already don't want to do this.
[05:11.62]I tried to talk myself up so much before the stream started.
[05:15.28]I already don't want to be here, but we're gonna go.
[05:17.47]Here we go.
[05:17.99]I'm not even gonna stop.
[05:18.97]By the way, spoilers.
[05:20.45]This is a very, very late-game optional hard boss.
[05:23.79]If you don't know what that is, then I would look away.
[05:37.46]Why does it feel louder?
[05:40.22]Is it louder to anybody else?
[05:46.23]It's really loud.
[05:47.31]Why?
[05:47.57]I didn't change anything.
[05:50.41]Oh.
[05:52.81]It wasn't even turned on.
[05:55.25]Sorry about that.
[05:56.61]It is louder though.
[05:57.95]It is.
[05:58.21]It actually is louder.
[06:07.50]Here we go.
[06:20.92]Not good!
[06:23.34]Fuck!
[06:42.97]Really?
[06:43.85]That was just, like, dust.
[07:03.87]Come here, dog!
[07:09.65]Watch that foot!
[07:49.57]Watch that foot!
[08:20.25]Okay, fine, fine, fine, fine.
[08:21.31]Watch out for the blast.
[08:22.23]Watch out for the blast.
[08:23.73]Blast incoming.
[08:28.41]You guys never listen to me.
[08:29.29]I told you the blast was incoming.
[08:30.64]Alright, shut up here.
[08:51.36]Not today.
[08:56.50]That's the best attempt I've ever had.
[09:06.13]Here we go.
[09:06.97]He's got a new move, right?
[09:07.93]I gotta jump?
[09:14.97]This is the one, right?
[09:15.66]Does it do it now?
[09:16.38]I wonder.
[09:17.52]Yup.
[09:19.38]Fuck!
[09:19.96]No, I gotta go earlier than that.
[09:21.38]I gotta go way earlier than that.
[09:49.24]Sorry, buddy.
[09:51.94]There it goes, right?
[09:53.64]Okay, let's see.
[09:54.96]One, two, is it just a good throw?
[09:59.48]Whoa, that's new.
[10:00.16]I haven't seen him do that.
[10:04.17]How long does that last for?
[10:09.25]Damn, okay.
[10:09.69]That's the first time I've ever seen him do it.
[10:21.75]I just gotta get out of the corner here.
[10:27.73]Get out of the corner.
[10:30.01]Come on.
[10:34.04]It's such a bad spot.
[10:35.58]That's just not fair.
[10:36.50]You just stopped in the corner.
[10:39.46]Like, seriously, I don't... Like, get out of the fucking corner.
[10:42.48]This is sick.
[10:46.08]Like, I would... That was just total, like, fucking broad shit.
[10:54.43]He's just sitting there standing on the wall where the cliff is.
[11:01.49]And here's the worst part about this.
[11:02.87]If you get any distance at all with this motherfucker, you're dead.
[11:08.22]So standing behind him, I'm just going to go off the cliff.
[11:17.64]That was a really good first attempt until I ran into the bullshit.
[11:45.67]He's already at an 8.
[11:46.67]Come on, what the hell was that?
[12:06.45]Behind him.
[12:08.09]Oh, that... I haven't seen him do that in a while.
[12:33.10]What the fuck?
[12:34.68]What just healed me?
[12:35.42]Really weird.
[12:37.52]I didn't press that.
[13:07.23]Alright.
[13:33.64]Alright, let's go face-to-face.
[13:36.44]Oh, not yet.
[13:38.56]Don't be so sure.
[13:41.28]Alright.
[13:50.07]I hope you don't stand at the edge of a cliff for two minutes.
[13:58.90]Alright, let's see if I can get this.
[14:06.59]No, fuck.
[14:07.85]I gotta go even earlier than that, I think.
[14:10.69]Maybe just walk to the side.
[14:11.97]I'm not sure.
[14:44.30]Again.
[14:44.73]Let's see.
[14:45.49]He like, winds up.
[14:46.75]No, you can't just run.
[14:50.31]Fuck.
[14:52.21]I thought you could maybe outrun it, but it tracks you the whole time.
[15:26.04]I'm encroaching, what the fuck is going on?
[15:27.96]This dirty control, is it really the dirt?
[15:31.90]Calm down, Jeremy.
[15:39.99]Fuck, they're gonna parry that.
[15:55.07]Trying to get distance on me.
[16:03.28]Alright, here we go.
[16:06.26]Is he gonna do it?
[16:24.87]Phase three, let's see it for the first time ever!
[16:27.47]Ever, shh!
[16:51.78]Let's go, phase three, come on!
[16:54.45]What is he doing in phase 3?
[16:56.06]Oh, fuck!
[17:00.18]Oh, he did, he did!
[17:01.84]It's a, it's a, whoa!
[17:04.68]It's a jump rope?
[17:16.67]I don't know, I guess?
[17:26.39]Oh shit, I have such trouble with this.
[17:28.87]Wow, it's a sweep!
[17:31.03]That was different than last time.
[17:35.76]That's also different!
[17:48.79]No!
[17:49.89]No!
[17:50.85]Get up, get up, get up.
[17:51.81]I'm gonna take it.
[18:25.22]What the fuck?
[18:26.94]Dude!
[18:35.14]What the?
[18:35.42]I don't know what he's doing!
[18:44.14]No!
[18:44.96]No, God!
[18:45.92]What the fuck?
[18:46.94]I tried.
[18:53.73]Oh my God!
[18:59.79]There was a flame wall in front of me.
[19:01.71]I couldn't even go towards him.
[19:04.15]I wonder what you're supposed to do about that.
[19:12.54]The whistle didn't work.
[19:13.70]Maybe it was too close for me to be able to use it?
[19:16.88]Oh, man.
[19:18.64]Hold on.
[19:21.96]I need a second.
[19:23.17]Fuck.
[19:23.53]I'm so, like... I'm so...nerved up right now.
[19:27.51]Damn!
[19:30.29]I wonder if I can... Maybe it's just cosmetic?
[19:40.86]If I run through that, I wonder how much damage you take.
[19:43.10]Or is it going to knock you back?
[19:46.66]I don't know.
[19:47.73]I don't know.
[19:48.27]That's weird.
[19:49.63]Maybe I just have to run?
[19:55.92]He does that weird, like, jump rope move.
[19:57.78]I don't know, like, maybe it's, it's, it's a... It looks like you just sweep it first, and then I fuck all know what the hell it means.
[20:06.55]Alright, let's go.
[20:20.26]Fuck.
[20:21.68]They're dumb.
[20:43.12]That's really the only thing you gotta worry about here.
[20:50.96]Here comes the balls.
[20:55.04]I got out of that stun quick.
[21:20.45]Again... See if I'm... The reason I'm not healing is I'm trying to get a...
[21:42.20]See, I thought I had a second between Phase 2 and 3.
[21:46.12]No, not you.
[21:47.38]It's like an instant, so I can't do what I'm doing here.
[22:00.09]I still don't understand how to get away from that.
[22:05.24]You know what I'm saying?
[22:07.14]I still don't understand.
[22:07.92]I've got to figure that one out, otherwise it's going to be the death of me.
[22:35.53]It's still the only move in the first two phases that I don't get.
[22:39.67]Can I go again?
[22:51.50]No.
[22:51.76]I thought maybe you could jump over it and grab him?
[22:55.56]Fuck, man.
[22:56.18]I have no idea.
[22:58.78]I tried running.
[22:59.62]I tried jumping.
[23:00.66]I tried running directly away.
[23:04.80]Maybe I just have to stay with him.
[23:24.57]Just fuck it.
[23:25.07]Just try to run up to him.
[23:26.97]Just don't ever let him get that far away.
[23:32.81]Oh, that was... Oh, I'm in trouble here.
[23:36.05]No.
[23:39.60]No!
[23:40.08]What?
[23:40.26]Too far away?
[23:42.30]Too far away?
[23:43.14]At least I know that.
[23:45.48]That's why it didn't work last time.
[23:51.95]I'm just panicking and realizing that I just beat it.
[23:54.61]I just beat that... Hold on.
[23:55.99]I need a second.
[23:56.67]I jumped over it.
[24:02.12]It landed and I jumped.
[24:04.92]So I have to run to the side and jump over it when it lands.
[24:11.22]Okay.
[24:13.57]I'm burning too.
[24:16.31]Oops.
[24:37.18]Whoa, that was weird.
[24:40.56]That was really weird.
[24:41.86]I, like, froze in the air.
[24:46.79]I didn't jump in time.
[24:48.41]Oh, fuck me, man.
[24:49.87]I got it.
[24:50.51]I do.
[24:50.85]Let's see if I can get it.
[24:52.83]Let's practice it.
[25:06.77]Now I'm just like all tensed up.
[25:10.65]It's the worst part about this, man.
[25:14.85]These fights take so long that you just get so tense.
[25:18.65]I gotta fucking relax.
[25:19.59]Here we go.
[25:21.61]Okay, I'm gonna ring.
[25:29.79]He makes her ring.
[25:31.33]Goddamn.
[25:54.13]Fuck, it's... That's the Kramer again.
[26:00.09]Oh, now I'm in trouble.
[26:02.61]Now I'm in trouble.
[26:04.17]Oh god, he comes back the other way through the fire.
[26:16.69]So on phase 3, when he jumps away, he's either going to do a barrage of meteors or a double slide.
[26:29.14]Okay.
[26:29.78]The double slide is... That usually happens first.
[26:35.74]The meteor didn't happen until the second one.
[26:37.95]I don't know how random it is.
[26:44.07]No, see, I'm trying to parry now.
[26:45.09]I'm trying to change things.
[26:45.81]Just kill me.
[26:46.33]Kill me.
[26:46.73]I wanna do it again.
[26:48.53]I gotta just do how I know I'm gonna do it, and not try to add things.
[26:52.48]I got to the phase three pretty reliably there.
[26:56.36]I'm not gonna do, like... Oh, let me try parrying now.
[27:01.66]25 attempts later.
[27:02.34]Like, no.
[27:02.56]No, no, no, no.
[27:03.12]I'm just gonna...
[27:12.44]He never reads useful shit?
[27:14.04]Well, I need to figure it out on my own.
[27:17.62]It's really easy for somebody to say, hey, go get this item and beat him.
[27:20.40]But that's... Why would I know that?
[27:21.78]Unless I found it or hid it.
[27:23.62]You know what I mean?
[27:24.12]Isn't that the point of no, like, spoilers in chat?
[27:29.41]I want to beat him.
[27:34.39]That's... If I need it, I'll ask for it.
[27:38.15]I can do it.
[27:38.69]I'm doing it.
[27:39.19]You've seen it in front of you right now.
[27:42.46]I got up to, like, 30, 20% in Phase 3.
[27:45.08]I got a million.
[27:46.26]Okay, here we go.
[28:14.28]I had it so close, dude.
[28:15.02]That's so unfortunate, but you gotta do what you gotta do.
[28:35.68]Is that something?
[28:56.07]Oh, he's forced to go in the air again.
[29:25.23]No!
[29:35.10]Don't do the third swing!
[29:49.35]This is all you need.
[30:17.27]What did that call me?
[30:24.00]Oh, didn't throw any missiles.
[30:25.88]What a fucker.
[30:31.35]Shit.
[30:31.67]Oh.
[30:32.05]Don't let that fucking kill you.
[30:34.41]Don't let it kill you.
[30:35.09]Just fucking go.
[30:55.20]I'm running out of these somehow.
[30:58.74]Oops.
[30:59.78]Manic.
[31:03.45]Whoops.
[31:04.71]Forgot about that.
[31:05.45]Okay, here we go.
[31:07.75]Here it comes.
[31:09.81]Run!
[31:11.93]Okay, it's right when it hits the ground.
[31:15.68]Easy.
[31:37.85]No, what was wrong there?
[31:39.13]Fuck.
[31:39.51]I gotta go backwards with it.
[31:42.72]Backwards.
[31:44.60]It's gotta be longer.
[31:47.10]It needs travel time.
[31:47.90]Otherwise you're gonna get divided.
[32:17.38]Stay back.
[32:21.60]No, why did I slide?
[32:24.02]Why did I slide?
[32:27.61]I tried to jump.
[32:30.27]What?
[32:33.49]I slid into a tree.
[32:34.29]What?
[33:07.32]Here we go.
[33:08.20]Alright, don't slide into a tree this time!
[33:29.29]Fuck.
[33:30.01]Thanks again.
[33:41.46]Let's go.
[33:42.98]Phase 3.
[33:43.32]Frank.
[33:43.68]Watch out.
[33:46.74]He's gonna do the thing.
[33:47.52]He's gonna... I don't know.
[33:58.39]That, that hitbox, fuck me.
[34:05.85]That's a third, he does another swing.
[34:07.37]I'm in fucking trouble now.
[34:08.98]God damn it, that fucking stupid swing.
[34:25.96]Fuck.
[34:30.58]Fuck.
[34:30.94]Is he- I don't know what it is.
[34:32.08]Is he gonna throw- What?
[34:35.09]What the- What?
[34:36.19]Why?
[34:36.83]I- That's- I did- I've done that the same way every time.
[34:46.16]Just run at him.
[34:46.88]Apparently-
[34:57.87]So, running at him every time he's ever thrown the meteors.
[35:04.58]I get insta-killed that time.
[35:12.07]I just, you run forward when he does that.
[35:17.63]She's changing the speeds of how fast he throws them?
[35:51.39]Alright.
[35:53.14]Sometimes he throws in a fourth swing there, and it's impossible to know when he's going to do it.
[35:58.34]It's just randomly he does a fourth swing.
[36:01.88]I've not noticed a single reason why he does that.
[36:03.82]Sometimes it's three, sometimes it's four.
[36:15.92]like two three no that's it three why why I don't get it
[37:14.16]Just got stuck.
[37:26.74]First phase is easy now, yeah.
[37:34.35]Really, it's the combo going from 2 to 3.
[37:54.69]That hurts every time you do it.
[38:07.31]Fuck, I dodged into it.
[38:08.35]I gotta parry the- OH NO!
[38:09.91]BAD!
[38:10.35]BAD Jeremy!
[38:11.09]BAD Jeremy!
[38:12.29]UGH!
[38:14.91]UGH!
[38:15.35]I MADE ONE FUCKING MISTAKE!
[38:17.71]It's over in like a 15 minute boss fight!
[38:21.69]UGH!
[38:26.02]One piece of human error just fucking ruins it all!
[38:46.95]I'm getting closer when I don't get caught up in the bullshit.
[38:54.55]This first phase is I barely even have to use a fucking potion.
[39:33.16]Get out of the corner here It's a bad place for all of us
[40:03.09]Big stomp.
[40:34.89]go so
[41:08.86]Don't do it, don't be stupid.
[41:09.70]Alright, come on.
[41:23.75]I'll get caught in one move.
[41:26.29]I gotta be... Excellent!
[41:28.97]Excellence!
[41:29.53]Let's go!
[42:00.15]That's not good.
[42:06.90]Fuck.
[42:07.26]No, it's so... Fuck me.
[42:10.54]Why?
[42:10.84]I was waiting for the fucking... Not what he did.
[42:17.08]Gotta be even more perfect now.
[42:32.91]We're gonna go again.
[42:33.53]Alright, is it gonna be the fucking meteors?
[42:35.13]Here, no, it's this.
[42:38.62]It's a huge windup.
[43:18.09]Okay, come on.
[43:23.42]What's it gonna be?
[43:24.08]Meteors?
[43:25.18]Nope.
[43:27.90]I gotta grab him too.
[43:54.89]gonna be so
[44:50.56]Fuck, no, I gotta run.
[45:01.98]Dude, I can't step sideways because of the fucking fire.
[45:06.20]Oh my god.
[45:14.59]Dude, what the fuck, it's instant!
[45:19.84]Jesus!
[45:52.42]What?!
[45:54.35]The fucking hidden box was bullshit!
[46:27.26]Daddy!
[47:07.06]What?!
[47:07.66]He's gonna do it again?!
[47:15.60]No!
[47:16.52]God, why?!
[47:20.34]Oh my god!
[47:22.58]You gotta be kidding me!
[47:27.96]Oh no!
[47:29.84]Oh my god, so close again!
[47:41.14]When he gets the barrage, you can't run through him.
[47:45.49]You gotta dodge him.
[47:46.51]Oh my god, this guy sucks.
[47:54.75]If it just didn't take so long.
[47:56.57]It's like the longest fight in the whole game.
[47:58.47]Dude's got more health than Medeir.
[48:00.92]From fucking Dark Souls 3.
[48:03.04]With like four people in the party.
[48:04.72]Give me a break.
[48:13.62]That was such a decent attempt too, like I really had it.
[48:35.21]That was such a good attempt.
[48:39.14]Jesus man.
[48:41.62]I got the Mortal Blade in my hands.
[48:43.16]You sure?
[48:43.58]Are you sure you didn't buy this from the fucking party store?
[48:48.06]Because that's what it feels like when you play this game sometimes.
[48:52.56]Are you sure this isn't the wooden trading sword from fucking Legend of Zelda?
[49:03.64]You sure this is the Mortal Blade?
[49:05.64]I just want to make sure you're aware of that, Sakura.
[49:08.56]I hope you have the right one.
[49:10.81]Not the eBay knockoff that you spent like fucking $39 on.
[49:13.21]And if I heal in phase one, it's pretty much over.
[49:43.68]I don't know how that wasn't in the dark.
[49:45.08]I've done it a hundred times.
[50:15.29]Is this the final boss?
[50:16.27]No.
[50:17.98]This is an optional boss.
[50:21.58]Somewhere in the corner in the fucking world somewhere.
[50:47.29]That was quick!
[50:48.71]That's the fastest you've ever done that.
[51:10.34]Go back to being a Fortnite stream.
[51:19.86]Holy, holy, that's what I was doing right now.
[51:22.31]I don't know what the hell's happening, but he's in a bad place.
[51:55.17]Nah, I thought it was a headbutt.
[52:05.21]The fucking goddamn wall here.
[52:08.10]I can't run around in here.
[52:11.08]Oh my god.
[52:14.26]This is never ending.
[52:20.07]This is pretty sick.
[52:45.43]Fucking boss.
[52:50.28]FromSoftware, I like the game you came up with here, Sekiro.
[52:53.30]That'll die twice.
[52:54.36]It's a really interesting concept, a game that can only be completed by a computer.
[53:01.17]That's really, you made it for AI.
[53:04.43]That's a great program, I love it, it's great.
[53:09.11]FromSoftware makes the first video game that is completable by artificial intelligence.
[53:14.05]They made it with robots.
[53:15.05]I guess I think robots are taking over.
[53:18.78]They're already getting video games made for them.
[53:56.07]Sooner or later.
[53:58.91]You guys are watching me play this game.
[54:01.73]No, you're gonna be buying games for your computer to play them.
[54:05.92]You're gonna be like, oh shit, he just got him!
[54:09.58]There's gonna be lines of fucking code.
[54:22.94]You're gonna be watching me watch a computer beat this game.
[54:50.78]Alright, fuck the Consumers.
[54:54.44]If I don't do it this time, I'm going to go farm for Resurrections.
[54:57.60]Because I feel like I would have been able to do it by now.
[55:07.20]Dude, I know what the slide is.
[55:10.16]I know what's happening now.
[55:12.34]Oh, right.
[55:13.00]Okay.
[55:13.50]Hold on.
[55:22.22]I'm pressing the left thumbstick in because it's so intense running around.
[55:27.24]And we have four actions tied to the same button.
[56:17.01]Wow.
[56:17.49]I don't like what you are!
[56:40.26]Fuck.
[56:41.04]Not greedy.
[57:06.96]Video games.
[57:08.88]Time for video games.
[57:09.86]Alright, now everybody quiet, nobody talk!
[57:33.73]No!
[57:36.20]What the fuuuuuck?
[58:14.55]Here we go, what's it gonna be?
[59:06.25]He's done it!
[59:07.49]I did it!
[59:08.23]I'm a computer!
[59:09.57]I get to be a computer!
[59:13.34]I get to be a computer!
[59:14.24]I get to live my life as a computer now!
[59:34.68]That was fucking insane.
[59:40.41]The battle memory of an extraordinary foe lingering in the mind of the wolf.
[59:43.51]Commune with the sculptors out of it and confront memories of battle.
[59:47.01]Yeah, the one-armed demon prowled the battlefield consumed by flames of deepest resentment.
[59:53.57]And a lapis.
[60:00.10]Was that actually harder than Orphan?
[60:01.48]Uh, no.
[60:06.91]I said that last night that I think it was the same type of issue that I had with Orphan.
[60:12.29]I just think he has a lot of health.
[60:16.67]I just think he has a shitload of health.
[60:28.06]And here's the thing, if you take the health down by like even 10, 20%, it actually might ruin that encounter, because here's the thing.
[60:41.79]I always... I never really like phase encounters in these games because you spend so much time trying to learn the new moves that they do that you almost forget the old ones.
[60:54.12]That's what kind of happened the three or four times I saw phase three is I was so desperate to figure out and learn the new move that he gets that you almost just fucking completely forget about the other first two phases.
[61:06.73]But
[61:09.15]I think it's by design, but there really only is about five moves.
[61:14.75]That are just difficult to understand.
[61:16.61]And that's what I'm saying, look what people were saying.
[61:20.33]Oh wait, why are you not doing it like this?
[61:22.53]I gotta figure it out, you know, I'm gonna just do it.
[61:27.94]You know, could I have made that encounter way easier by going to get like item X?
[61:31.72]Maybe.
[61:38.26]We don't want to hear your life story.
[61:41.90]What?
[61:45.89]I'm like defending myself.
[61:47.47]I got 15,000 fucking souls.
[61:48.55]Look, I just beat one of the hardest encounters in the whole game.
[61:56.98]You know, I can't... On to the next one immediately!
[62:01.00]I can't sit here for fucking two minutes?
[62:04.08]Really?
[62:05.64]Really?! !
[62:18.82]One guy said that.
[62:22.96]In any regular circumstance, I would go fucking take a bath right now.
[62:29.13]In fact, I might just have the controller in my hand and be in the bath.
[62:38.18]Mod that guy.
[62:38.96]Come on.
[62:44.04]Like, this is a fucking wildly...
[62:46.69]Focused encounter.
[62:47.61]It's like a full almost five to ten minutes straight boss fight.
[62:51.54]I think I should be able to sit here for like a couple minutes and just talk.
[63:03.69]The battle memory of an extraordinary foe.
[63:04.99]Okay, a man who failed to become Shura instead became a vessel for the flames of hatred.
[63:10.96]As fate would have it, he was bound stubbornly to this world.
[63:13.22]It wasn't until he became a demon that he was finally able to depart for the next.
[63:21.79]Interesting.
[63:27.83]Why no facecam?
[63:28.77]I don't like facecam.
[63:29.73]I don't really do facecam.
[63:30.87]If you're new.
[63:33.51]Sealed shot.
[63:34.13]Why?
[63:41.01]Alright.
[63:41.65]So, I did it.
[63:43.75]Now I have to go... I did the two snakes.
[63:52.50]Because there was a giant fuck-off demon at the door.
[63:55.36]I guess that is why you would seal the door.
[63:58.44]He's wearing... I'm not wearing the same shirt again.
[64:00.20]I'm wearing a, like, workout shirt, because I knew I was gonna be, like, freaking the fuck out and talking about, like, AI and shit.
[64:17.91]um is this that lady is this the rice lady oh you're still alive you know don't you you know who the one-armed demon was before I see it might be better that way what a fate
[64:40.09]to be set ablaze in the fires of hatred and suffer eternally as a demon.
[64:46.81]You put an end to his misery.
[64:50.17]That's all it was.
[64:54.25]Some advice.
[64:55.71]The hatred he channeled has lost its vessel for now.
[64:59.49]The longer the fires of war rage on,
[65:03.01]Maybe if I bring him some sake.
[65:15.50]He sure did love that.
[65:22.00]No more sculptor at the idol.
[65:26.99]All of a sudden I get to fight this big guy over here.
[65:28.95]Do you know who that was?
[65:30.95]Better that you don't.
[65:34.62]Knock one back for him.
[65:41.83]I will right now.
[65:48.74]Pour out a monkey booze.
[65:51.52]He did like all the booze we brought him.
[65:55.95]Interesting.
[66:04.42]That was fucking hard.
[66:08.36]That's the... I'll be honest with you.
[66:10.84]That was the hardest boss I think I've fought in a, like, FromSoftware game.
[66:15.48]Maybe Orphan and... Well, Medeir.
[66:18.36]Medeir was just hell because it just took too long.
[66:23.84]I feel good, though.
[66:25.92]I do feel very satisfied.
[66:29.14]My soul was ripped apart.
[66:30.24]Is there anything else I can do here?
[66:37.15]I was just walked off the edge.
[66:39.89]Thank God there's like an idiot wall.
[66:42.09]Because I was just like, I'm gonna walk this way.
[66:46.02]Prove you're not wearing the same shirt.
[66:47.42]No, I don't have to do that.
[66:51.80]I don't have to prove I'm not... I don't have to prove anything.
[66:56.01]I think we go back to the estate.
[66:58.29]We have to go through the door, right?
[67:01.27]Anything else?
[67:01.69]There's probably something secret here.
[67:03.15]Let me go back to the idol.
[67:08.16]Wait.
[67:11.02]Hello.
[67:11.40]What do you got?
[67:16.56]No, I've already seen you.
[67:19.04]Two heavy coin purses.
[67:23.60]Computers don't wear clothes.
[67:33.63]How far am I?
[67:34.39]I'm at the end of the game.
[67:35.77]So if you just popped in here to be like, oh, did he just... Get out.
[67:39.56]You don't want to be here.
[67:40.74]I'm literally at, like, the final probably hour or two of the game.
[67:53.93]And by hour or two, I mean... I'm probably gonna get my ass kicked for, like, at least two or three hours.
[67:59.81]But that's fine.
[68:00.55]I'm willing to go crazy.
[68:03.58]I'm gonna lose it.
[68:05.70]I barely started talking about how computers are gonna take over and... That's nothing.
[68:10.31]You ain't heard anything yet.
[68:13.97]Still don't have one of those.
[68:25.46]What about skills?
[68:30.85]He still doesn't have the spear.
[68:32.33]No, I'm not gonna have it.
[68:34.17]I'll be the one guy that doesn't have the spear.
[68:35.85]That's fine.
[68:37.80]I don't care.
[68:39.52]It's not necessary with a video game endgame.
[68:43.36]Alright, what?
[68:43.94]Get that off the screen before somebody screams at you.
[68:46.58]Okay, so.
[68:49.68]I have...
[68:57.62]Why is this not available?
[68:59.36]I need that to get this.
[69:03.87]Living Force is through here.
[69:09.35]Which I'm gonna need this and that.
[69:14.20]I don't know what to do with these points.
[69:28.19]Maybe the mid-air tool?
[69:29.11]Because we're at the very end of the game unless there's something I really desperately am going to need here.
[69:39.04]Mid-air combo?
[69:40.22]Maybe.
[69:40.98]Or... Vault over?
[69:48.84]Maybe mid-air combo.
[69:49.84]I don't know.
[69:50.24]But there's only like a couple...
[69:57.82]Maybe more of the emblems?
[70:00.04]It's one.
[70:00.60]Yeah, fuck it.
[70:08.11]But I feel like maybe that... It's only one, right?
[70:09.83]Is that gonna be enough for me to... I can do both.
[70:21.98]Combo arts while in the air.
[70:27.95]I feel like it's necessary at some point.
[70:31.63]And then Shadow Rush.
[70:35.13]So I need three more.
[70:38.73]Have I ever used a combo?
[70:40.15]Yeah.
[70:41.30]I use this thing pretty frequently.
[70:44.36]Ever since I got it.
[70:45.26]I don't use it on bosses, though.
[70:47.78]Ooh, a box.
[70:55.62]What the fuck is this?
[71:02.12]Phantom Gunai.
[71:04.10]Can be used to upgrade the Loaded Shuriken.
[71:09.57]And a- I got- I think I got- it's the spear.
[71:12.85]I got Luigi'd.
[71:18.58]How many prayer beads do I have?
[71:26.32]Come on, where's my prayer bead?
[71:27.18]I have, like, I need two more, right?
[71:31.97]I have to pay money for the spear.
[71:34.67]What do I got for cash?
[71:35.43]Let's see.
[71:35.75]Uh, no, no, no.
[71:43.42]I have, no, what do I got?
[71:44.40]I got 1,000, 2,000, 2,100.
[71:44.66]Not enough.
[71:45.28]I could sell some stuff, though.
[72:03.74]Dragon Rock cured.
[72:10.80]So I have zeroed four.
[72:14.90]The worst part, I feel like I've missed so many prayer beads.
[72:20.66]How you doing, you good?
[72:21.24]I don't think there's any more business for you right now.
[72:27.75]Okay.
[72:33.89]I think I'm ready.
[72:40.03]Let's continue.
[72:47.86]Now, where was it?
[72:48.84]It was... No, was it Kuro's room?
[72:50.78]No, there was like a secret door or something, right?
[72:53.00]No, no, no, it was the... Reservoir, right?
[72:59.58]So I gotta go back to the reservoir.
[73:10.33]When you feel like you missed something, but you don't know what.
[73:12.27]Yeah.
[73:13.77]It's always like that with these games, though.
[73:23.61]What do you have?
[73:24.15]I already bought it.
[73:25.67]Okay, there's Mask Fragment 2.
[73:29.21]Mask Fragment 1 is over there.
[73:31.05]Where's the other one?
[73:32.88]$5,000.
[73:33.18]Guys, I'm not gonna buy that.
[73:37.34]May the departed rest in peace.
[73:41.00]Alright, so we gotta go back to the reservoir, which was... Is it this way or that way?
[73:55.79]No.
[73:58.62]What's the mask for?
[73:59.62]I don't know.
[74:00.30]I also got two... I spent all that time getting the snake hearts, and I have no idea what those do.
[74:08.30]No, this is wrong.
[74:25.80]This is the castle entrance.
[74:28.32]This is the giant mo- Why does the mouse keep popping up on the screen, man?
[74:37.88]The snake hearts are for a true ending, though.
[74:43.90]Well, how do I do it?
[74:48.68]So then I can- Is it down here?
[74:49.92]It's this way?
[74:58.50]I think it's down here.
[75:08.41]This is like the moat, right?
[75:11.15]I gotta go down.
[75:17.22]Is this the right way?
[75:24.91]I don't think it is.
[75:32.03]Is it?
[75:32.39]I need to get like a higher, I need to get a better view.
[75:40.08]Wonder if I can still get there from here.
[76:02.92]LOL moments with Jerma985.
[76:04.08]No, this is more... ...desperately clinging to... ...trying to be good at a video game.
[76:12.17]8-5.
[76:17.43]What?
[76:18.03]Oh, they're just fighting.
[76:27.42]This way.
[76:34.48]No, that's just where I was.
[76:35.64]I was just here.
[76:41.55]Well, you... You stopped caring.
[77:03.33]Alright, this is just a mess.
[77:06.31]This may as well just be Dark Souls PvP.
[77:10.44]No, I don't even want to fight you guys.
[77:14.96]I just want to go to wherever I need to go.
[77:18.66]It's like that beginning area of the game with the huge bridge.
[77:22.52]Ugh.
[77:24.02]And I can't teleport here.
[77:43.33]I think this is it.
[77:55.20]Is this it?
[77:57.68]I think this is it.
[78:00.84]You don't want to do that.
[78:03.36]That's what I'm trying to stop.
[78:19.27]Oh, fuck.
[78:20.39]Who's the boss?
[78:26.97]Alright.
[78:34.46]Is it two at the same time?
[78:37.18]Probably should have backstabbed one of them, but I guess... Okay, well.
[78:43.18]Um...
[78:46.60]Just come back.
[78:47.36]For fun.
[78:48.00]I have two.
[78:57.39]Uh, no.
[78:58.19]This is not.
[78:58.81]There's no way you can do that with two people.
[79:02.11]This is no way.
[79:03.01]Like, I have to backstab one of them.
[79:05.15]You know what?
[79:05.81]I'm gonna try something.
[79:16.06]So that guy's turning though.
[79:17.16]Okay, how do I fucking jump on that guy?
[79:18.78]Do I just have to kick that guy's ass first?
[79:28.62]As fast as I can?
[79:58.78]Let's fight him.
[80:00.57]Let's go, you and me.
[80:05.63]Oops.
[80:13.44]Oh, he kinda just- he just hit me.
[80:17.32]Okay, I should probably back up a little.
[80:22.27]He doesn't know which way to go.
[80:23.53]See?
[80:24.65]How much does this suck, buddy?
[80:26.51]Doesn't it suck to have to fight two people at the same time?
[80:28.75]Yeah, it sucks, doesn't it?
[80:42.42]Yeah, you see it in real time, how hard it is.
[81:07.98]Come on.
[81:19.21]Nope, that- that- whoops.
[81:20.47]Don't enter the fire!
[81:21.61]Don't enter the fire!
[81:27.98]Remember how hard this guy was?
[81:29.55]I mean, yeah, I did have, uh, I did have somebody helping me, but... Fair beats.
[81:42.52]I remember that guy giving me so much trouble.
[81:45.42]Even, uh, yeah, I did have a co-op partner, but still.
[81:47.64]Eli?
[81:55.28]I tried to talk to him.
[81:56.84]He apparently didn't want to talk.
[81:58.38]Okay.
[81:59.32]Well, I tried.
[82:01.98]Uh, I'm gonna just revive my shit.
[82:10.04]Because that guy's not gonna come back.
[82:11.04]One of them will, but... It's fine, I don't care.
[82:13.66]I'm just gonna leave anyways.
[82:19.23]This looks like the correct way to go.
[82:23.73]To the secret door.
[82:32.32]And there's a new idol there.
[82:35.51]But exploring this area is probably a good idea.
[82:44.23]Oh, no.
[82:45.11]Why?
[82:46.96]They make it look so... It's right there.
[82:49.14]It's just right there for you, waiting for you to do it.
[82:54.38]No, apparently not.
[83:09.09]Now I can do it.
[83:13.90]Wow, no way anyone can do that.
[83:18.24]That's superhuman strength right there.
[83:22.96]Hell, it's... Nothing else to do.
[83:26.86]I think I'm just gonna go... Nah, I'm gonna go from there, though.
[83:34.69]He has a robot arm?
[83:37.19]I guess so.
[83:38.37]He does have a robot arm, you're right.
[83:41.59]He is made out of robotics.
[83:42.80]See, he's fucking AI already taken over.
[83:44.34]I told you who they made this game for.
[83:53.80]Uh, what about up here?
[83:54.60]Nothing?
[83:55.52]No.
[83:56.82]Alright, here we go.
[84:04.11]Rest a bit.
[84:10.99]Secret passage key has been used.
[84:12.77]Let's take it to the next area.
[84:24.98]Activate boomer bot.
[84:32.62]Okay.
[84:38.31]Is there a reason why every FromSoftware game has an end zone like this?
[84:43.35]Dark Souls 3, Bloodborne.
[84:45.41]This is Lightning Guy, right?
[84:50.00]Oh shit, I really did buy mine on eBay.
[85:07.53]If you think you can change Ashina's fate with such a thing.
[85:12.43]I have the real one.
[85:13.87]You are mistaken.
[85:14.67]You bought the one on the convention floor.
[85:17.94]Wolf.
[85:20.34]No one has the right to the dragon's heritage.
[85:23.20]It is no one's to bear.
[85:29.24]I wish there was another way.
[85:34.44]It's alright.
[85:40.10]We started here.
[85:40.74]We end here.
[85:43.86]We both have mortal blades.
[85:46.17]Wait, does that mean if I die, then the game ends?
[85:48.65]Yes.
[85:50.39]Let's finish this.
[85:55.05]That seems kind of weird.
[85:55.93]Wait, but we both have mortal blades.
[85:57.67]I can't lose this fight.
[86:01.63]I will restore Ashina to glory.
[86:07.64]Alright, you've got a long wind-up time here.
[86:10.60]That's a thrust.
[86:13.20]That's also a thrust.
[86:14.54]No, it's not.
[86:15.02]Wait, he just reversed my reversal?
[86:17.98]Wait a minute.
[86:19.54]I reversed you, and you reversed me?
[86:21.33]That doesn't work.
[86:23.99]What?
[86:43.36]Back it up.
[86:45.84]Fuck.
[86:56.34]What?
[86:56.72]Wait a minute!
[86:57.38]Wait a minute!
[86:58.39]I'm dead!
[86:58.93]What?
[86:59.27]He- He- You can't reverse that?
[87:05.83]Is that- That's a- That's a thrust!
[87:07.67]Was that a thrust?
[87:13.46]Well, game over.
[87:14.00]I lose.
[87:23.41]Okay.
[87:30.82]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[87:56.17]Wow, I dodged him somehow.
[88:02.64]Oof, alright.
[88:06.30]Okay, he's gonna get his moveset now.
[88:08.56]It's hard to get a moveset now when you die instantly.
[88:11.47]Okay, here's the grab, right?
[88:12.43]Coming up.
[88:24.43]I'm not sure I can block those.
[88:32.30]That... Nah, fuck.
[88:36.28]I... I'm against the... That's what's going on.
[88:39.44]I'm against the wall here.
[88:41.72]I can't move.
[88:56.75]It's hard to see through the grass.
[89:00.17]The high flowers make it hard to see what he's doing.
[89:23.05]He changes it up a lot.
[89:24.43]He's got a sweep, he's got a thrust, he's got a grab, and there's different thrusts.
[89:29.21]He has two different thrusts.
[89:31.17]Alright, this is fun.
[89:32.65]Let's go.
[89:32.97]Nah, it was a sweep.
[89:46.49]I thought it was thrust.
[89:49.02]Fuck, man.
[89:55.30]Eel!
[90:02.90]Sweep again.
[90:10.73]Jesus Christ!
[90:11.83]Oh my- It's an insta- I'm dead.
[90:13.31]Instantly.
[90:14.49]Fuck me.
[90:15.05]Okay.
[90:15.59]Okay, that's- Nope, I don't know why I had to- Fuck, I was thinking there.
[90:30.62]No, I tried to jump but pressed two buttons at the same time.
[90:38.20]Jesus!
[90:40.72]Oy oy oy!
[90:46.19]That move is the best split time to get any damage in.
[90:56.85]Alright.
[90:57.59]Goodbye.
[90:59.95]Mortal Blade!
[91:00.85]You got your Mortal Blade taken from you.
[91:04.09]I'll take it.
[91:07.54]I can't wait for the centipede to blow out of the top of his head.
[91:11.56]Right?
[91:12.06]That's definitely not the whole fight.
[91:17.68]He's gonna cut himself in half.
[91:23.73]Uh-huh.
[91:57.58]I was in there for so long pitiful grandchild this was your last wish it stinks in here what how the person can't fit in there who the how do you even fit in there to see ashina returned from the great beyond
[92:26.38]What?
[92:26.82]He just shed that guy.
[92:31.83]What the fuck?
[92:33.63]Isshin?
[92:33.89]Isshin was dead.
[92:34.93]Three health bars?
[92:35.71]Oh.
[92:35.77]Easy now.
[92:55.45]Oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, oh boy, okay.
[92:59.31]Fuck!
[93:23.44]Oh, you're FAST!
[93:26.89]And that's- okay, that's a Slash.
[93:35.71]One, two, three.
[93:37.03]He's got a couple combos.
[93:46.18]Oh my god, okay.
[93:47.82]Um...
[93:56.16]I gotta see as much of them as I can.
[93:57.43]What the fuck?
[94:03.05]Okay, I don't... It's a long charge.
[94:11.91]I think you probably dash around it.
[94:19.99]I'm also just realizing something really important.
[94:23.77]I gotta fight this dickhead every time.
[94:28.03]No.
[94:28.29]Do I have to fight Genichiro again?
[94:30.41]No, like, you haven't figured it out, like, after so long.
[94:37.98]Like... I don't want to fight these four people.
[94:43.02]That's four health bars.
[94:45.70]Eventually, this is going to get to a point where this guy is not even a problem anymore.
[94:48.84]It's just an annoyance.
[95:00.45]Thought I got it.
[95:07.97]No, I... It's not even... It's four as a four health.
[95:19.34]Just think of it as a four health bar fight with cutscenes in the middle.
[95:35.70]And, uh, we're gonna, we're gonna, alright, see, uh, what time is it right now?
[95:40.64]It's like 5.30 Pacific?
[95:42.42]Alright.
[95:43.42]Uh, I'll see you at like 10pm when I maybe eventually get this guy down to one bubble.
[95:49.87]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[96:03.30]Fuck, I thought I could get it right there.
[96:17.91]That was sloppy.
[96:34.24]Alright, bring on Grandad.
[96:35.28]I don't know why I'm not watching the cutscene.
[96:47.09]Alright, here we go.
[96:47.67]Eight flasks.
[96:51.96]Sweep.
[96:56.70]Jesus Christ!
[96:59.06]Just give it to the battle!
[97:01.50]You think the darkness is your ally?
[97:07.53]What the fuck is he doing?
[97:15.79]Damn it.
[97:16.59]I got it.
[97:19.84]Oh boy!
[97:23.28]He's gonna do it!
[97:39.19]Come on, let me get to phase two.
[97:40.11]Let me see it.
[97:41.99]Fuck.
[97:42.49]I tried to.
[97:42.86]I'm an idiot.
[97:49.51]Fuck me, man.
[97:51.09]Oh, I still got health!
[97:52.11]No!
[97:58.13]It's hard to tell sometimes if he's dead or not.
[97:59.89]He like lies on the ground for too long.
[98:03.18]Sometimes you spend like an extra second like you do like the I died.
[98:15.50]I had like 0.2% health.
[98:34.43]Well, very obviously was becoming very obvious.
[98:37.28]This guy, you have to just go in.
[98:40.38]You see what happened that first when I was doing right there?
[98:49.34]Not with you in particular.
[98:50.38]Now I'm just fucking being stupid.
[98:54.18]That happens every single fucking time.
[98:57.30]I heal right when he's about to do that move.
[99:00.38]Just do it again.
[99:04.52]That has happened every time.
[99:06.50]I heal.
[99:06.96]No, he's going for the Slash.
[99:17.32]He's reading my inputs.
[99:25.98]The thing it seems with Isshin is his posture wasn't that great.
[99:30.28]If you stay up on him... Let me just get there.
[99:32.15]I will restore Ashina to glory.
[99:45.10]Speaking of posture, mine's pretty bad right now.
[99:47.44]Oh my god.
[99:48.40]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[99:49.70]I beat him.
[99:54.04]I did it so easily like two tries ago, and now he's just kicking the shit out of me.
[100:02.50]What the fuck?
[100:19.60]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[100:51.51]Oh my god, what the fuck?
[100:53.13]Why?
[100:53.51]I'm dead.
[100:56.11]Oh god.
[101:00.42]I had it so cl- wait, it just- When I par- I deflect the fuck out of him.
[101:05.76]And my posture gets destroyed.
[101:14.12]I deflected almost every attack he did.
[101:16.82]And my posture is gone.
[101:27.16]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[101:50.05]Hmm.
[102:09.65]Look, he ducks in the grass, man.
[102:12.71]Oh, my fucking god.
[102:14.37]Get out of here.
[102:28.48]You look like the real boss, you chump.
[102:34.71]Come, sicko.
[102:52.58]You gotta stay up on him.
[102:57.91]Damn it.
[103:00.47]Look at me.
[103:01.27]Look at this posture.
[103:04.17]Oh.
[103:24.75]He's gotta dash around it when he goes up in the air like that.
[103:28.77]I tried.
[103:29.45]I tried to grab it.
[103:55.11]What the slash?
[103:55.89]Fuck.
[104:06.91]Jesus, man.
[104:13.77]He's so good.
[104:14.93]His moves are so hard to predict.
[104:17.13]Holy shit, he's insane.
[104:19.08]And this is phase one.
[104:23.44]Oh my god.
[104:24.40]Even when you deflect the first one.
[104:39.55]Good luck!
[104:40.65]Good luck!
[104:41.97]Oh, it's over.
[104:42.49]I'm dead.
[104:44.69]Oh, goodness gracious.
[104:51.78]You are in hell now.
[104:52.76]This took me 52 tries.
[105:08.05]See you in five hours.
[105:09.81]This took some people six to seven hours to do.
[105:29.74]Wow, that's ridiculous.
[105:36.45]Alright.
[105:36.81]Wow, that's unbelievable.
[105:55.00]No, he does it every time.
[105:56.42]Jeremy, what are you doing?
[105:57.76]He does it every time you leave.
[105:59.64]Me, me, me, me.
[106:01.49]Me, me, me, me, me, me, me.
[106:05.55]What?
[106:06.39]He's hiding.
[106:07.39]He's like behind the fucking turd.
[106:09.69]He's on the fucking turd.
[106:19.02]Just kill me.
[106:19.64]Like, that was fucking stupid.
[106:21.12]I just got... I got LOS'd by the giant shit rock in the middle.
[106:43.81]I love when you username in third person.
[106:46.91]I'm trying to tell myself to relax.
[106:48.97]Let's just not do this every time.
[107:27.80]Dang it!
[107:29.82]Dude, how many dings am I going to get in a row?
[107:34.56]Jesus Christ, what is he doing?
[107:37.27]Oh, my God.
[107:55.00]coming at you.
[107:55.72]Ding!
[107:56.08]Coming at you.
[107:56.70]Ding!
[107:57.02]This time I'm gonna do it four times in a row.
[107:58.90]Oh, what the fuck?
[108:08.91]This posture is nearly full.
[108:10.02]Yeah, but all it takes is for you to get hit once.
[108:14.20]Sekiro.
[108:15.22]Shadows get hit two times and die.
[108:16.96]That's the new title of this game.
[108:19.04]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[108:51.97]Oh my god, I'm trying to run around it.
[108:53.28]Come on.
[109:02.91]It's not even worth it to resurrect.
[109:04.49]It really isn't.
[109:06.29]Because you have to fight Grandpa.
[109:08.79]You have to fight Hyper Grandpa with three fucking bars.
[109:28.43]I will restore Ashina to glory.
[109:32.48]I will not allow Ashina to be crushed.
[109:47.69]I did not... Fuck.
[109:55.69]Really.
[109:59.46]Thank you for letting me hit you.
[110:24.94]Alright, dear old grandad.
[110:27.22]I didn't even know where he was.
[110:29.42]That was a weird camera.
[110:42.07]No.
[110:52.35]Look at that posture damage I'm doing to him.
[110:53.77]It's not even touching.
[110:54.81]It's like touching.
[110:55.89]I'm just like tapping him on the shoulder.
[111:14.13]What?!
[111:15.75]Wow, that was a huge sweep.
[111:29.73]I tried to block it.
[111:30.85]I did though.
[111:31.83]Thankfully.
[111:32.85]Save me.
[112:01.78]Back it up.
[112:05.08]Whoa!
[112:05.62]Fuck!
[112:06.08]No!
[112:06.46]God damn it!
[112:07.75]Oh my god!
[112:09.11]Die in one hit!
[112:15.89]It's a sw- I don't even know, man.
[112:17.33]It's so hard.
[112:17.93]He puts the thing in the sheath and then who the fuck knows what he's doing.
[112:30.67]No.
[112:38.06]Holy shit.
[112:51.01]You know how we talk about, like, people that will complete this game?
[113:02.44]And somebody said, who is this game for last night?
[113:06.97]I wonder what the Steam achievements will be for this.
[113:10.03]For, like, somebody beating Isshin.
[113:12.27]I wonder how many people would stump it and get this far.
[113:16.57]This has got to be, like, 0.2%.
[113:43.98]Back it up.
[113:47.51]What the hell are you doing?
[113:54.95]I thought it was... It was a little early, but I still got it.
[114:18.08]Okay.
[114:19.04]Come on, Grandpa.
[114:38.53]It's a Slash!
[114:39.27]Yep.
[114:47.97]No, I don't even... Man, he's such a variance in his moveset.
[115:02.17]It's almost like you can't even predict what he's got.
[115:03.79]You have to block everything he does.
[115:05.47]It's hard to determine when he's gonna fucking do anything.
[115:08.46]We got no telegraphs, really, except for the dings.
[115:13.20]God, man.
[115:21.55]No.
[115:25.09]No.
[115:33.10]Can I just accept that he's better than me?
[115:35.70]And we'll watch the YouTube video at the end of the game?
[115:42.15]It's so fast man, you don't even get a second to react to it.
[115:46.33]I gotta get like burned into my brain.
[115:48.95]Holy fuck Oh my god
[116:10.29]In front of him?
[116:11.33]In front of him for that move, maybe?
[116:14.38]I don't know.
[116:14.90]Maybe he's staying in front of him.
[116:34.33]What?
[116:34.83]No!
[116:35.03]I thought I was gonna get a ding!
[116:54.80]Just don't get hit.
[116:55.68]You underestimate how hard this is.
[117:02.78]Let me get some shit here.
[117:04.52]I don't really want to use anything until I have... Get this off the bar.
[117:15.82]I don't really want to use sugars until I can reliably get them at least down to like the first phase.
[117:24.57]I'll get him on the bar just to have him, but... I only have three.
[117:27.96]How many do I have in storage?
[117:28.74]Eleven?
[117:42.08]Play the inspiration music?
[117:43.08]Oh, we're not ready for that yet.
[117:46.20]I can't even get this guy past the first bubble.
[117:50.80]Yeah, I'm not gonna use any of these until I can reliably get them to at least pass first or second phase.
[117:59.76]I have no more Spirit Emblems.
[118:04.93]Oh, wow, that's bad.
[118:07.05]Well, there goes my whole shit moment.
[118:20.46]I'll be honest, I think I have to take a break.
[118:25.11]The Demon of Hatred was so uncomfortable that I think I have to take a break.
[118:32.87]And like come back in like 15 minutes or something and do it.
[118:35.31]Like just chill for like 10 minutes.
[118:40.79]These two back to back is like no way.
[118:44.29]Not gonna happen.
[118:55.99]I'll try it one more time.
[118:57.81]And then I'm gonna need, like, spirit emblems.
[118:59.64]This is gonna be a nightmare.
[119:00.98]I will restore Ashina to glory.
[119:25.29]I thought, wow, I thought I was in the right.
[119:30.22]Did it hit me with the handle?
[119:32.61]It hit me in the head with the handle.
[119:53.20]My posture is just gone.
[119:54.46]There's no one to come to.
[120:02.26]No, man.
[120:09.19]I need posture, please.
[120:12.05]I'm so sweaty right now, too.
[120:17.41]This is like... This is the hardest workout I've had in like three years.
[120:34.91]Your posture will break if you miss a parry.
[120:38.52]You know how hard it is to block and parry every move?
[120:42.70]That's like, unreliable.
[121:00.59]I'm trying to parry these guys.
[121:03.20]It's just so awkward.
[121:05.28]He hesitates on half of it.
[121:15.29]That... fucking tracking.
[121:21.35]No, I thought it was this big sweep.
[121:26.70]Oh my fucking god.
[121:31.14]Not even a scratch on him, by the way.
[121:38.57]No, I thought he was putting it in the sheath.
[121:40.96]I thought he was going right in the sheath.
[121:45.88]No, I'm dead.
[122:05.98]Fuck you, man.
[122:10.71]I can't even second him.
[122:13.21]Fuck.
[122:33.28]One bubble.
[122:33.76]Let's see phase two.
[122:34.70]Let's just look at it.
[122:35.72]Let me just see it, and then I'll watch the rest on YouTube.
[122:38.66]I'll watch the rest of this on YouTube.
[122:46.53]What happened?
[122:50.67]He has a gun.
[122:52.23]He's got a gun.
[122:56.11]He has a different weapon?
[122:57.31]They already did this in the last game.
[123:07.34]I'm just gonna use the fucking turd rock.
[123:19.39]Jesus FUCKING Christ!
[123:41.32]He pulled out a gun.
[123:42.34]Whatever.
[123:46.17]That's ridiculous, man.
[123:48.15]Oh my goodness gracious.
[123:49.31]This is fucking wild.
[123:51.51]They're not fucking around in these last few encounters.
[123:53.33]Especially, like, these last two.
[123:55.69]They were just like, yeah, you know, you thought things were hard, but... We're on, like, AI level of difficulty now.
[124:03.15]Just kill me.
[124:16.57]Alright, last time.
[124:20.17]Last attempt.
[124:20.73]And then I'm gonna... I'm just gonna fucking stare at the screen for five minutes.
[124:24.43]I don't even know what to do.
[124:35.58]I wish I didn't have to do this.
[124:36.62]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[124:45.41]And you, come on.
[124:46.43]I'm like, you tell me when to fucking last a little bit of that.
[124:49.09]Alright, I gotta take a break.
[124:50.81]This is insanity.
[124:54.90]I'll be back in like two minutes.
[125:02.44]I'm just gonna, I'm gonna go walk around and throw water in my face.
[125:10.51]I'll be right back.
[127:01.12]I didn't even pause the game.
[127:12.14]I have to just memorize everything.
[127:15.65]I have to play Space Channel 5 with a sword.
[127:20.79]Left!
[127:21.27]Right!
[127:21.71]Left!
[127:22.21]Right!
[127:23.11]Choo!
[127:24.07]Choo choo!
[127:31.37]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[127:59.17]I gotta get the fuck out of here.
[128:00.23]My posture.
[128:01.44]Oh my god, I was trying... Fucking 180 degree tracking.
[128:07.98]From Dark Souls 2.
[128:09.19]It's here.
[128:11.49]What?
[128:30.40]He's gone.
[128:30.96]No.
[128:50.78]I keep thinking he's going to keep going around.
[128:52.90]When he does that big, long... He does a big, long... Just hold on.
[129:00.40]We'll talk about it after I die in like 30 seconds.
[129:19.90]Let's try it again.
[129:23.53]Look at this posture already.
[129:47.64]Jesus fucking Christ, man!
[129:50.46]No, it's a... Dude, I don't even know why they have healing voids for this fight.
[130:04.75]They should have taken them from me.
[130:06.19]You don't have an opportunity to do it!
[130:21.26]Damn it, no!
[130:25.21]I just didn't know!
[130:43.34]He's back to full posh too.
[130:46.74]No.
[130:48.06]Oh, I'm fucked.
[130:49.78]Ohhh.
[131:15.05]Hesitation is defeat.
[131:17.84]But Sekiro, hesitation is defeat.
[131:21.10]But sorry, you haven't memorized every single animation the developers have made.
[131:29.72]Sekiro, why didn't you memorize every move I do?
[131:42.97]I'm not going to get out of this.
[131:45.29]I will not allow our ship to be crushed.
[131:56.62]Oh, slash.
[131:59.66]Oh my god.
[132:04.48]Yes, that's it.
[132:06.26]Strength.
[132:08.59]I didn't even get to respawn before he started that animation.
[132:31.60]Young Sekiro.
[132:34.28]Don't let me hit you.
[132:35.88]Forehead.
[132:38.73]No.
[132:38.99]Ayayay.
[132:39.71]One hit kill can still get him.
[133:15.11]Stop hesitating.
[133:18.68]This is so ridiculous.
[133:22.44]This is a case study.
[133:23.56]They got hired by the government to make this game.
[133:25.54]I'm convinced.
[133:27.10]This is like a government project.
[134:15.76]What if he's fucking with you?
[134:16.88]Hesitate before doing anything.
[134:29.37]Look at that posture, though.
[134:30.39]Even if I try, I gotta... Maybe I should just run the fuck away.
[134:33.31]You know what I mean?
[134:55.80]Oh no!
[134:56.40]I thought it was the big one!
[134:58.88]Is there any way to tell?
[135:00.16]Because seriously, he puts the sheath in and then... Oh, is it a sweep or is it the big one?
[135:04.36]It's so fucking... You got that like tenth of a fucking second to react to these things.
[135:14.07]Like in human reaction time.
[135:16.55]It's just... What the fuck?
[135:33.59]It's because it's human reaction time.
[135:35.13]That's why I went so wrong.
[135:39.64]That's how you do it.
[135:40.38]No, but that's... See?
[135:53.91]It's so weird.
[135:58.71]Thought it was done.
[136:03.32]Fuckin' hell, I can't!
[136:05.22]The heal is a vulnerability.
[136:32.04]It's hard to get yourself out of that mindset where... Don't ask me.
[136:37.30]I'm trying, guys.
[137:00.84]Sloppy
[137:37.93]What?
[137:38.31]No!
[137:38.99]He was doing this.
[137:59.28]Could have blocked it.
[137:59.92]Yeah, but here's the thing.
[138:02.42]They put in this rock-paper-scissor gameplay.
[138:05.96]that I'm like waiting to see that emblem because I can't, I have to do the, whatever the technique is to get away from it.
[138:12.64]So when he goes down, here I come for a sweet, nope, no, no, no, nope, it's just a regular attack.
[138:16.13]It's just like, fuck man.
[138:17.79]Makes it so much harder.
[138:18.59]I will restore Ashina to glory.
[138:32.18]Like see, he did that same thing last time and it wasn't that move, you know?
[138:35.67]You see what I'm talking about?
[138:58.51]Like, he ducked down and did but this time the indicator popped up.
[139:02.17]He did that before and he went into a combo.
[139:13.65]You gotta win the lottery with the number of scratch tickets.
[139:28.58]I didn't get any of those.
[139:29.36]Damn it, I didn't have... I'm just hesitating now.
[139:42.97]I'm just getting exhausted fucking playing this.
[140:04.02]Okay, I thought he was gonna... No, can't jump over that.
[140:10.86]Trying to test it if I could.
[140:12.22]Oh.
[140:26.79]See, my reaction times have just dwindled from doing this for so long in a row.
[140:41.88]No, I don't have the demon thing on anymore.
[140:43.62]I crushed it.
[140:52.92]This took me five hours to beat, somebody said.
[140:59.89]That's why I'm telling you, this is a government experiment.
[141:11.48]He still got very dead.
[141:13.62]I think I'm gonna go get Spirit Emblems and just take a second, because when you do it so many times in a row, you just... Everything starts to blend together and just becomes impossible.
[141:32.10]I'm gonna carry it onto the roll.
[141:43.07]Oh yeah, I'm lost.
[141:44.75]I've drained every ounce of my energy at the demon fucking hatred.
[141:51.51]And now I'm just like fucking on fumes right now fighting this.
[142:06.53]I need like a second wind or a... something, man.
[142:24.44]Give me like a second wind.
[142:30.62]Inject caffeine directly into your bloodstream.
[142:33.38]I don't know if that's a good idea.
[143:04.78]One mistake, and he's dead.
[143:11.38]Oh no, I thought I could... I thought it was a big circle around you.
[143:16.73]No, I...
[143:33.21]You can parry it, but I just wish I could fight him and not have to go through the first guy every time.
[143:38.56]This is like naughty.
[143:42.26]The phase two is like fucking ten times worse than this shit.
[143:58.35]The first guy's a weakling?
[144:01.12]Yeah, I know he is.
[144:02.26]But remember what I just said about how doing the same thing over and over again, your brain just starts to hate it?
[144:08.06]Like, I don't want to fight Genichiro.
[144:09.99]Every time.
[144:10.87]I already killed him!
[144:13.35]Start me... Like, right when the grandfather cutscene happened.
[144:18.91]We don't have to do this again?
[144:30.81]Reaching a seven?
[144:31.59]Oh shit, it is frustrating.
[144:58.63]He said a 9.
[144:59.31]Well, this is the last boss in the whole game.
[145:02.91]So, I mean, like, of course.
[145:04.85]Of course, with their computer, they wanted to make the encounter fucking, like, 2% of every player will ever beat it.
[145:11.42]That's fine.
[145:12.62]I'm gonna try to be one of, like, the 3% of every human who's purchased this game to beat it.
[145:33.58]I have to actually, like, go get spirit emblems or something.
[145:37.28]This is all blended into my brain.
[145:39.66]Like, everything's the same.
[145:40.80]Everything.
[145:41.43]The whole world is blended together.
[145:42.69]Every color.
[145:43.69]Every flower is turning into the same flower.
[146:06.85]Alright.
[146:09.49]Don't I have a thing?
[146:10.31]There it is, right?
[146:33.34]Now this kills me.
[146:34.04]Where's the thing that I can give myself Spirit Emblems?
[146:41.64]Is it a combat art or what?
[147:01.34]Ceremonial Tanto.
[147:07.50]I only have three of them.
[147:15.28]I mean, what... That's a plus five.
[147:18.94]That doesn't seem like very much.
[147:24.14]I can only use it once per life?
[147:30.92]I guess I could buy them, too.
[147:33.48]How much do they cost?
[147:40.48]Fifty for one.
[147:42.44]Well... What else am I going to spend my money on, right?
[148:00.96]500 coins, 10.
[148:02.40]What's the point of this even being in the game?
[148:07.93]This is like... 500 bucks?
[148:15.33]No, I'd rather just go grind the money.
[148:30.79]Uh, yeah, I'm gonna, I'm gonna, I'm taking a break from this shit.
[148:33.33]I'm gonna go do something else.
[148:35.99]Fuck this final encounter.
[148:48.00]Uh... I know there was a couple of mini-bosses I could fight.
[148:56.88]There's still like two or three.
[148:59.38]Are there any more bosses left?
[149:00.36]No, this is the last one.
[149:05.07]There was something here.
[149:12.65]This is with the stealth section, right?
[149:20.40]In the manor?
[149:27.96]How many prayer beads do you have?
[149:29.21]I couldn't do this with at least eight.
[149:30.95]Um... Uh, let me see.
[149:34.67]Are they here?
[149:44.00]One, two, three, four, five, six.
[149:45.72]I have six.
[149:59.96]Am I under-postured?
[150:01.42]You don't need eight.
[150:11.99]I feel like I'm just delaying the inevitable.
[150:14.72]I'm missing a gourd, too, somehow.
[150:18.40]There's no way this game has nine gourds, right?
[150:20.86]I missed one somewhere.
[150:30.99]There is 10.
[150:31.65]Yeah, I would assume.
[150:32.49]Yeah, the gourds really don't matter.
[150:49.45]That's true.
[150:49.96]It really is true.
[150:51.56]Like, healing is... When I die, I have, like, 7 or 8 healing gourds.
[150:58.26]You just have to... You gotta be, like, on point.
[151:03.78]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[151:50.06]See, like I have nine healing boards.
[152:22.95]Oh.
[153:01.49]Fuck!
[153:01.71]I thought I had a second.
[153:07.47]Take a heal!
[153:08.17]Why am I crouching?
[153:24.89]Crouching!
[153:28.00]Here we go.
[153:29.48]Okay, he does.
[153:30.98]Here he comes.
[153:32.62]Good luck.
[153:33.42]Second time I've seen it.
[154:01.46]Damn.
[154:02.78]And a thrust right after him.
[154:33.25]so so
[155:02.48]What the fuck is this?
[155:04.40]Oh, goodness.
[155:32.08]The amount of effort it takes to get there.
[155:36.20]I can build up some strength for one or two attempts.
[155:43.53]The second phase is like, don't parry him.
[155:46.36]I'm just gonna dodge around.
[155:49.90]Right?
[155:50.14]Like, I mean, maybe?
[155:51.24]I don't know.
[155:51.98]I feel like I'm...
[155:54.92]I'm confused on how to do that, second phase.
[155:56.48]No, I'm good.
[155:56.96]Just reflect the bullets.
[156:38.60]Come on man, just die I don't even know how he hit me with that
[157:21.39]I will restore Ashina to glory.
[157:24.03]Nice fucking bunch of dumb fucking moves.
[157:33.90]Swings 400 times.
[158:10.32]Something something, Ashigen.
[158:19.05]You go from such a different rhythm.
[158:22.15]It's just painful.
[158:53.29]Save him.
[159:20.95]I thought it was the sleep thrust but it wasn't.
[159:57.69]Alright, two.
[159:59.51]I'm just gonna take it.
[160:02.73]Let's try some dodging, maybe.
[160:04.21]Not enough.
[160:07.12]Wow.
[160:27.77]No way!
[160:29.19]No way!
[160:30.35]No fucking way, man!
[160:55.17]No!
[160:57.01]No, no, no
[161:19.87]What?
[161:26.31]How many attacks do you have in that sequence?
[161:40.00]It's almost like you're not even attacking.
[161:41.98]Shit's just happening around you.
[161:54.51]Come on.
[162:18.88]I don't even need a chance, even with a parry.
[162:20.28]I can't even fall open there.
[162:23.72]I'm trying to run, but of course I stumble and fall.
[162:37.89]Of course.
[162:56.69]I... I'll tell you.
[163:18.93]So it's the dodge button is the Makiri counter, right?
[163:23.81]So anytime someone says, why are you dodging into him?
[163:25.53]Don't dodge into him.
[163:26.48]I'm trying to do the Makiri.
[163:28.48]But dodge is also on that button.
[163:33.08]So it just, it happens.
[163:38.99]Dodge is this button.
[163:40.23]Makiri counter is also this button.
[163:47.31]So I'm not trying to dodge into him.
[163:49.07]It's just happening because it's the same button.
[163:58.83]And yeah, the timing is probably off, but that's...
[164:47.89]I wouldn't be surprised if I died more here than I have in the entire game.
[164:52.76]How many deaths for the whole entire experience?
[164:55.46]A hundred something?
[165:01.22]Do we even have a counter?
[165:11.38]I'm looking at chat right now.
[165:12.86]This is a mistake.
[165:46.42]Thought I parried it already, but...
[166:15.16]Oh, it's so frustrating.
[166:17.34]Fuck me.
[166:25.82]Ugh.
[166:44.43]Oh, you crap.
[166:49.30]Maybe you'll restore Ashina to glory.
[166:53.32]I don't think you will, though.
[166:54.32]Because we've had this conversation over and over and over again.
[166:58.92]And I keep killing you.
[167:01.23]But yet here we are.
[167:02.11]I have to see your face again.
[167:04.87]It's great.
[167:05.57]I love it.
[167:29.60]He restored Ashina to glory this time.
[167:31.45]And what's going to happen this time?
[167:32.49]Maybe I'll prevent him from restoring Ashina to glory.
[167:37.75]Let's do it again on Boss Before the Boss.
[167:43.09]See you next time.
[168:14.74]Whoops!
[168:15.08]Come, Shakiro!
[168:55.10]Nah, my reaction time is zero.
[168:56.64]This is it.
[168:58.70]I'm gonna play a different game for like an hour or so.
[169:03.17]I am at a 2 for reaction time right now.
[169:15.53]Dammit.
[169:25.09]Fucking relentless.
[169:28.60]I wish there was a stamina bar in this game.
[169:30.00]I need to be able to manage half these motherfuckers better than I can now.
[169:51.80]If you pull me out of your neck, I'll fight this whippersnapper for you.
[169:56.10]Let me just reach into my neck and see what I got here.
[170:29.44]Oh, fuck!
[170:57.99]young second or try me again in the second phase let's do it son
[171:25.88]The amount of posture he does with these moves, even with the fucking parries, is ridiculous!
[171:40.35]Damn.
[172:06.30]No, no, no.
[172:11.76]Let me get a follow-up there.
[172:15.39]No follow-ups allowed.
[172:20.59]That's a huge move.
[172:33.27]No follow-up, no.
[172:34.19]It takes too long.
[172:36.07]Pairing any of his moves with the spear, you can't do a follow-up.
[172:40.17]It just does posture damage to you.
[172:42.19]That's all it does.
[172:44.80]I just barely can get one.
[172:45.90]See what I'm saying?
[172:54.08]I can't.
[172:54.46]Gotta get the fuck out of there.
[173:04.53]I'm so fucked.
[173:12.42]No, no, no.
[173:13.47]Just can't.
[173:40.98]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[174:05.17]Give me a fucking break.
[174:07.95]Give me a fucking break.
[174:08.91]Give me like a fucking break.
[174:10.23]And I didn't catch that one.
[174:17.30]What the fuck is happening, man?
[174:45.03]Isn't this supposed to be a stealth game?
[174:47.57]Yeah, I guess.
[174:49.50]He's already starting with that shit?
[175:06.24]So, if you heal, you're dead.
[175:08.94]They have a way to- every time.
[175:25.47]No, I thought it was the- God, man.
[175:30.20]This is next level.
[175:31.30]It really is.
[175:52.48]Uh... Prosthetics?
[176:06.17]I have to grind for spirit emeralds.
[176:38.12]Okay, I can tell you something.
[176:40.04]I parried like 98% of every single move.
[176:44.99]And like still, this motherfucker is still gone.
[177:13.37]Second.
[177:13.95]Second.
[177:49.39]Alright, come on, let's see it.
[177:57.53]Now my blood pours!
[177:59.38]Haste me, Satan!
[178:00.92]Tear!
[178:02.98]Tear!
[178:14.93]That was not it.
[178:16.25]I would have caught it.
[178:18.09]Just so slow.
[178:20.71]And that's it.
[178:21.37]You make one mistake, start the whole fucking thing over.
[178:24.70]This is great.
[178:56.05]Wow, he's already up here
[179:21.48]No way.
[179:22.66]Not dealing with that.
[179:31.01]T!
[180:02.14]Shit in my face!
[180:27.93]Back it up.
[180:29.29]Well, I'm on the fucking end of the bridge.
[180:33.64]No, no, nope, nope, nope.
[181:05.96]WAIT!
[181:44.79]No!
[181:45.35]I need to see phase three, motherfucker!
[182:03.48]Phase three!
[182:05.64]Oh, this is gonna be horrible!
[182:08.12]What does he do?
[182:09.96]Wow, it's lightning!
[182:13.04]What the fuck?
[182:15.29]Does lightning just strike random places?
[182:26.01]Oh no.
[182:36.18]Alright, I'm gonna beat this motherfucker.
[182:38.84]This guy's dead.
[182:39.62]I'm gonna beat this.
[182:41.62]I'm going for it.
[182:43.22]I can do it.
[182:43.88]I'm gonna beat him.
[182:47.42]I'm gonna beat this guy.
[182:48.73]I'm gonna do it.
[182:49.25]I'm gonna- I'm gonna have to get some fuckin' Durango juice or somethin'.
[182:56.88]I'm gonna get like an apple juice.
[183:25.22]Bring it on, let's go!
[183:41.33]I'm ready!
[184:25.40]Don't fucking let him fuck you up.
[184:29.68]Posture.
[184:34.15]Bad.
[185:09.38]I got that!
[185:42.89]Oh fuck, I forgot he did that shit!
[186:05.21]I gotta get the fuck out.
[186:08.66]Bye
[186:29.28]Jumbo.
[186:31.97]Jumbo.
[186:35.63]Jumbo.
[187:00.02]Oh, I'm sorry.
[187:13.25]No, fuck, fuck, fuck.
[187:15.57]I thought it was fucking dive.
[187:22.03]Come on.
[187:35.80]No, it wasn't... I thought I had... I tried to do the fucking Makiri.
[187:40.54]Just to... It was too... I... I saw it.
[187:43.24]I tried.
[187:50.87]That's so slow.
[187:51.39]The delay on some of these scary moves.
[187:54.37]Un-fucking-bearable.
[187:59.59]Sometimes he's just like... There it comes.
[188:02.87]Ugh.
[188:27.22]I will restore Ashina to glory!
[188:58.61]No!
[188:59.23]Holy shit, I made it!
[189:00.69]I was sloppy as hell, but alright, come on, old man.
[189:33.35]caught me there.
[189:40.92]Whoa, that was bad.
[190:20.67]Didn't get that.
[190:26.51]No, god damn it!
[190:28.01]Give me a fucking break!
[190:29.09]That was horseshit!
[190:32.75]Oh my god!
[190:34.69]One mistake!
[190:37.25]Just don't make a mistake, bro.
[190:42.35]12 minute boss fight.
[190:43.37]Don't make any mistakes, sir.
[191:25.34]I think I just jumped off the camera, yeah?
[191:49.25]Computer reactions.
[192:10.05]Come, Sekiro!
[192:39.27]Every time.
[192:45.55]I gotta back up a little.
[192:46.79]Not a great trade there.
[192:55.00]No, I got a bad start here.
[192:56.20]I gotta get back into that shit.
[193:01.62]No, we thought it was the spin.
[193:02.94]It's just so easy to get caught up and get hit by one of those.
[193:07.55]They both have the same windup.
[193:12.33]Can't save them.
[193:40.89]Eight fucking gourds.
[193:41.75]Oh yeah, crouch.
[193:42.37]Please crouch.
[193:43.09]Yeah, can I disable that fucking button?
[193:45.53]How do I?
[193:45.79]I'm gonna disable crouch.
[193:50.58]Seriously.
[193:52.06]I'm gonna disable it.
[193:52.92]It's so easy to press it.
[193:57.00]Like, why the fuck is this even a thing in the game?
[193:58.50]Like, get rid of it.
[193:59.08]I don't want it.
[193:59.98]No crouch.
[194:00.88]Get the fuck out of here.
[194:02.98]I can't even unbind it.
[194:14.94]No, that doesn't matter.
[194:15.98]I can't unbind it.
[194:19.34]Really?
[194:19.58]I didn't fuck anything else up, right?
[194:37.43]Yeah.
[194:38.20]Like, get that fucking off my bar.
[194:40.48]So unnecessary.
[194:47.72]No, every time it's a little palm block, it's a thrust.
[194:59.49]And crouch.
[194:59.95]I've used crouch like three times in the 45 hours I've played this game.
[195:32.31]No, I fucking ran.
[195:34.29]Man.
[195:36.06]I fucking thought...
[195:55.20]So that whole third- I don't even know what he does.
[195:57.06]That's the worst part about this fan is just grinding to fucking get to the third bubble.
[196:02.09]To see the new moves.
[196:03.91]That's going to instantly kill me.
[196:07.93]Fucking government project.
[196:09.47]It really is.
[196:10.47]I swear to God.
[196:13.56]Like, see how susceptible they are to fucking repetition.
[196:32.51]I tried to jump there, but the fucking fat ass fender just hit the button.
[197:05.17]That was quick right off the bat.
[197:06.76]Whatever.
[197:07.62]I got nine of these fucking things.
[197:12.10]Mistake.
[197:16.78]That was a mistake.
[197:20.34]I gotta run.
[197:37.84]What?
[197:38.44]How did I not parry that?
[197:58.99]I wish that jump follow up would work, like, even half the time.
[198:24.10]uh dodge instead of what I wanted to do sometimes I forget I'm playing from every button is the same button software from soft from every there's three actions on one button am I playing Red Dead
[198:54.21]What?
[198:54.45]Oh, he didn't even go down in his other face.
[198:56.03]Back it up.
[199:16.08]That was... Oh, shit.
[199:17.92]Oh, shit is what we call it.
[199:28.02]We'll just do this until you stop.
[199:51.69]What?
[199:52.77]Listen to me.
[199:53.87]Listen to me.
[199:54.71]Listen to me.
[199:55.91]Every single ledge in the game.
[199:58.45]Every single one.
[199:59.33]Go back and watch every VOD.
[200:01.31]Every single ledge you can't run off of.
[200:03.25]It stops you.
[200:03.83]You have to jump.
[200:04.79]I just walked off that one.
[200:09.77]No fucking way.
[200:12.29]I even tested it.
[200:13.33]I was running into the fucking wall like an hour ago.
[200:20.07]I don't have any gourds left.
[200:22.65]Oh, that's so fucking stupid.
[200:24.51]Why can you even walk off the edge here?
[200:28.03]Of all things, to add to this encounter, being able to fall off the fucking edge.
[200:32.84]I think I was in, like, Phase 3 or some shit.
[200:38.14]I would be so... I'm screaming right now.
[201:01.16]I mean I could use my pellets but this is I'm dead here I'm gonna be gonna come smash me really I can't believe that
[201:31.36]Now we're at the edge again.
[201:32.06]Make sure you don't walk off the ledge.
[201:50.83]Dude!
[201:51.05]My posture's recovering so slowly right now.
[201:54.61]Fucking god damn it, man.
[202:07.01]You know they're going to make a game somehow harder than this one, and then nobody will play it.
[202:25.00]They're going to keep going until there's no way you can beat it.
[202:34.52]The next game FromSoftware makes... It might be... It might be, like, times five.
[202:47.60]Alright, remember Bloodborne?
[202:50.38]Everyone was like, holy shit, Bloodborne is crazy!
[202:55.20]But here's the next part, right?
[202:56.92]Once everybody figures out how to play this fucking game, and more than two weeks go by, people will figure out every little bit of cheese, everything to do, you have to learn how to parry, right?
[203:07.45]But man, going from iframes to this, holy shit, it's like completely different.
[203:14.49]You have to relearn an entire new video game.
[203:16.27]Like, not even just a new video game, but like, an entirely new way of thinking.
[203:23.51]A lot of games don't even come close with the kind of mechanics that are here in regards to how it feels.
[203:29.91]It's fucking amazing!
[203:30.97]This is fucking awesome!
[203:32.13]But my goodness does it take a lot to fucking forget everything you've ever learned playing most of these games.
[203:52.87]Seriously, my reaction times just went to shit right there.
[203:56.71]I was waiting for it.
[204:09.86]You're not supposed to beat this dude in one night.
[204:11.80]You're supposed to come back like six times and beat this guy.
[204:13.92]See if Brian can process the fucking encounter.
[204:23.55]Let's go.
[204:24.15]Come on.
[204:56.92]That's all I did?
[205:30.79]it's back to heal what whoa whoa hold on here what was that I got like that was strange it like turned me around
[206:06.14]Yeah
[206:48.23]That back pull, fuck that.
[206:50.57]I'll come you on.
[207:33.84]Wait, there's more of this fucking combo?
[208:05.48]Alright, what the fuck we got now?
[208:06.90]I got to see it.
[208:08.58]I gotta revive.
[208:26.47]Didn't get it?
[208:26.97]It didn't get it.
[208:27.75]I didn't get it.
[208:52.29]Risky, but worth it.
[208:56.49]No, I thought he was doing the thing!
[209:09.05]No, what?
[209:10.72]She did it twice in a fucking row.
[209:11.86]How am I not getting this?
[209:13.12]Fuck you.
[209:16.51]This is not...
[209:43.77]No!
[209:44.21]I thought it was the lightning move again!
[209:45.95]No, it was the thought it was the lightning move.
[209:49.74]Fuck, man.
[210:02.49]I thought he was doing for the lightning and I'm just gonna try and time it.
[210:06.01]You have to jump so much later than he does.
[210:10.29]Painful.
[210:12.42]Painful, painful, painful, painful.
[210:14.30]I got it.
[210:14.74]Come on.
[210:15.94]That was the best attempt all night.
[210:20.71]Fuck me.
[210:24.57]Trying, guys.
[210:25.23]I really am.
[210:26.71]I'm trying.
[210:28.29]I promise.
[210:30.46]I'm trying.
[210:55.31]Okay, come on, man.
[211:00.41]I gotta use the buffs?
[211:01.37]Yeah, but the thing is... Duh.
[211:07.10]They take like a couple seconds to work.
[211:10.06]And knowing me, I'm gonna use them and get hit by something and die.
[211:15.76]I know me.
[211:19.87]Well, that was dumb.
[211:28.96]I'm still, like, fucking shook up from that last one.
[211:31.11]Let's see if I can get a decent attempt here.
[211:41.76]No, I'm getting too close, I think.
[212:00.97]That just teleported into the clock.
[212:14.62]Let's just use one now.
[212:19.50]I'm gonna fucking die with that one.
[212:36.12]Back up, back up, not worth it.
[213:01.77]That combo, you gotta just run away.
[213:09.93]It can't be stopped.
[213:41.20]This one right here, man.
[213:45.72]It's just no fucking way.
[213:50.18]Really neat.
[213:56.08]When he does that, like, he does like four or five moves in a row and even if you parry him, you're just dead.
[214:00.19]You have to just run.
[214:06.57]Next time.
[214:06.97]Just gotta relax.
[214:18.54]I will restore Ashina to glory.
[214:22.18]Whoops, I fat fingered that.
[214:35.67]Yeah, I fucked it up.
[214:37.21]My hands are, like, covered in fucking water right now.
[214:39.29]I gotta, like, fucking wipe them off with something.
[214:47.57]This controller is fucking filthy.
[214:54.64]Alright.
[214:58.02]I'm gonna get him.
[214:58.48]I'll beat him.
[215:00.28]Positive thoughts only here.
[215:03.06]Only positive vibes today.
[215:04.84]That's not true.
[215:05.32]I've been fucking talking shit this whole time.
[215:29.08]I thought that uh... Ooh, getting sloppy.
[215:32.18]Not really, actually getting sloppy.
[215:34.54]Like for real getting sloppy.
[215:37.92]Still a lightning round.
[215:39.30]From that fucking lightning round.
[215:52.01]Yeah, look at me.
[215:53.95]My like body is like nerves up.
[215:57.91]I'm just making mistakes.
[216:06.45]Let's go.
[216:11.26]All ready off the bat.
[216:12.30]I have six heals left.
[216:27.08]I'm fucked here?
[216:28.12]Nope, okay.
[216:44.84]Oh fuck!
[216:50.94]No!
[216:51.66]I just jumped preemptively like an idiot.
[216:58.43]No, no, no, no.
[217:00.59]Ugh.
[217:02.81]No.
[217:04.98]His first phase just fucks me every time.
[217:08.58]Seriously.
[217:09.12]Now he's back to fucking zero posture again.
[217:24.17]No.
[217:24.75]Ugh.
[217:25.01]It's getting... It's slowing down.
[217:26.29]I gotta fucking...
[217:35.27]Couple more tries, and then I'm going to grab some water.
[217:42.34]Damn.
[217:42.56]I'm going to grab some water, I'm going to slam like a 16 ounce, and I'm going to come up fair.
[217:51.38]Do you remember a lot about Minecraft fair?
[217:52.59]Thanks for the five community subs.
[217:54.35]Thank you so much.
[217:55.55]Every stream it seems like you give subs to.
[217:57.07]Thank you.
[218:13.33]That's not it!
[218:14.56]You know, I never see him do that, so that's why I keep getting it.
[218:18.12]I usually kill him before he does it.
[218:20.80]I've been parrying for 80s.
[218:28.38]It's alright, just get the fuck out.
[218:51.52]Sloppy.
[219:01.39]That combo gets me every single time, and he starts off with it every time, man.
[219:06.29]That like, one, one, two, three.
[219:08.63]I'd snap, I'd never parry it.
[219:34.91]I didn't dodge that?
[219:36.12]How is that fucking possible?
[219:38.54]I looked like I did.
[219:42.10]Thank god that was not what I thought it was.
[220:02.03]I almost got fucked by that too.
[220:04.33]Look at how far away I was.
[220:26.09]See, there it is, man.
[220:32.12]There it is.
[220:32.82]No way can you stop that.
[220:34.94]It's not.
[220:35.34]No way.
[220:36.08]No way.
[220:36.38]Even if you carry everything.
[220:37.78]No fucking way.
[221:04.45]Yeah!
[221:05.53]Yeah!
[221:39.09]Fuck.
[221:46.32]That was clean, too.
[221:47.84]Real clean.
[222:11.08]Back it up.
[222:11.56]Don't.
[222:11.90]Stay in here.
[222:12.32]Don't stay in.
[222:13.06]No reason to.
[222:15.17]We can do all this bullshit.
[222:16.97]Spin, spin, spin, spin, spin.
[222:34.73]Let's do it.
[222:35.85]I'm ready.
[222:36.11]What do you mean?
[222:39.33]What's wrong with the audio?
[222:43.44]There's a buzzing sound?
[222:46.78]What?
[222:51.56]Are we good?
[222:58.32]Alright.
[223:00.74]Here we go.
[223:02.56]Here we go!
[223:07.23]Stupid fucking mouse, oh my god!
[223:09.95]Get the mouse off the screen!
[223:12.76]Why can I not?
[223:13.72]Oh my fucking god.
[223:15.11]Why is this even a thing?
[223:16.09]What?
[223:43.95]No!
[224:17.59]No!
[224:17.85]God damn it, Jeremy!
[224:18.88]Fuck you!
[224:20.62]I got no opportunity!
[224:21.54]I have to just fucking go!
[224:22.62]Come on!
[224:58.20]Push!
[225:31.55]Sick!
[225:31.71]Sick!
[225:32.09]Yeah!
[225:34.91]Yeah!
[226:08.09]Yes!
[226:09.97]He's dead!
[226:11.57]Yes!
[226:12.09]Fuck you!
[226:14.97]Wait, no.
[226:16.33]Phase four?
[226:22.46]He's in phase four?
[226:26.20]I can't move.
[226:29.66]I don't care, just give me the credits.
[226:40.21]Oh, that was fucking crazy!
[227:01.88]Damn, what a fucking game.
[227:05.06]Initial P, thanks for the five community subs.
[227:08.74]Oh, I could like cry right now.
[227:12.08]God damn it, man.
[227:13.14]That was fucking crazy.
[227:19.73]One fucking mistake.
[227:21.07]Your body just gets so, so beside itself.
[227:31.18]Okay, here we go.
[227:31.58]Let's read this.
[227:32.12]The battle memory of an extraordinary foe, lingering in the mind of the wolf.
[227:35.30]Commune with a sculptor's idol and confront memories of battle for attack power.
[227:39.00]At his peak, Ishinoshina devoted himself to deadly conflict in pursuit of strength, a single-minded killing machine of a man.
[227:54.53]Dragon Flash.
[227:59.27]Ugh.
[228:02.34]Alright, so, I'll tell you, you want to talk about like a final rating for the game?
[228:07.26]We were at like an 8.7 last night, right?
[228:09.48]Yesterday?
[228:13.84]That fight was so ridiculous.
[228:17.33]I think that bumped it up to a 9.
[228:23.57]I hated that, but I loved it at the same time.
[228:28.17]Oh, it was so exhilarating.
[228:33.89]I think I'm gonna give this a 9.
[228:35.99]In his younger years, Isshin was a devil with a sword, spending his days in pursuit of life or death combat.
[228:45.70]He often ruminated on how a cut should be made, but his blade always moved first.
[228:50.86]He ain't gonna get up, right?
[228:52.40]He's not gonna, like, stand up and turn into an ape?
[228:58.26]Look, bucko, we don't want to hear your life story.
[229:03.66]I did it!
[229:04.70]I did it!
[229:05.20]Yes!
[229:06.06]I was- I had some thoughts there that maybe not.
[229:08.82]You know, I was getting a lot of self-doubt halfway through that fight.
[229:13.63]And I'm just sitting there going, uh-oh.
[229:15.83]Am I gonna be- am I gonna be one of the people like the- Is there anything else I can do?
[229:29.65]Oh, man, it feels so good to just know that it's over.
[229:32.73]Well, not that I'm glad the game is over.
[229:36.47]But that fight is over.
[229:40.71]You okay, girl?
[229:53.18]Give Divine Dragon's Tear.
[229:54.77]I mean, I have it.
[229:58.51]Here.
[230:05.20]I can't wait to play Picross for like another hour or two.
[230:22.07]We're coming down hard here guys.
[230:24.89]I'm gonna come down and play Picross and just hang out and fucking relax.
[230:53.93]My sworn shinobi now Sever these ties of immortality Well, that kid's a badass not even like a
[231:40.00]Wait.
[231:44.16]Wait, wait, wait.
[231:46.18]What?
[231:51.24]I become the sculptor now?
[231:54.22]I think it is best that you have this.
[232:03.97]What is that?
[232:06.35]No doubt the day will come.
[232:11.12]when a shinobi arrives, seeking strength.
[232:15.43]What?
[232:18.53]Oh, the cycle just repeats?
[232:26.19]So wait, what?
[232:29.45]So I, was I the sculptor?
[232:33.07]You are the sculptor, so you, the shinobi then shows up and you do the whole thing again.
[232:48.17]Well, I got the two snake hearts, but I didn't use them, apparently.
[232:51.15]It's the same story as Dark Souls.
[233:08.42]Oh, that was exhilarating.
[233:12.46]I said a lot, I talked a lot of shit, but it was venting.
[233:15.80]I hope you guys understand that.
[233:17.59]Because that was truly like a fucking ridiculous experience.
[233:32.84]Here's the- you know what, I'm gonna tell you something right now.
[233:37.00]They're gonna have to do something.
[233:39.07]Is anything gonna be able to- I feel like every other video game is- Let me turn this down.
[233:46.75]After playing through Sekiro, I feel like every other video game is just not even gonna be easy.
[234:02.29]No, more video games can be made.
[234:09.15]Video games are easy now.
[234:13.01]I'm going to be so spoiled rotten, I'm going to go play another game and it's going to be like, this is not as hard as Sekiro.
[234:19.04]This is easy.
[234:20.42]I'm ruined forever.
[234:29.62]No, but for all my...
[234:32.92]venting complaints, frustrations.
[234:37.99]That was fantastic.
[234:42.59]I am very, very happy to have that experience.
[234:51.20]I think some of these bosses, a couple of them were probably my favorites of the whole series.
[234:56.68]Just in the way that you play them.
[235:04.16]Ludwig from Bloodborne is my favorite boss ever made.
[235:10.42]But I would probably say... The ape... The first time you fight the ape was just crazy.
[235:20.99]It was so cool.
[235:23.05]It was really kind of out there and frustrating, but it was... The Guardian ape was a very interesting, cool encounter.
[235:34.22]Sekiro isn't a Soulsborne, though.
[235:35.70]I know.
[235:39.46]The owl fight was awesome.
[235:44.40]Even some of the... just the mini-bosses were really, really interesting, too.
[235:50.57]Kill Demon of Hatred?
[235:51.51]I did.
[235:53.09]I did that before this.
[235:58.74]How would you rank it compared to Dark Souls 1 through 3?
[236:01.82]Well, it's kind of not fair to make that comparison, though, because they're just not the same.
[236:09.24]Bloodborne, I think, is my favorite still.
[236:11.42]But that's... I'm so biased for Bloodborne.
[236:16.43]It's like one of my favorite games ever made of all time.
[236:19.37]It might even be my favorite game ever made.
[236:24.13]But Sekiro is probably...
[236:30.17]I think it's... I think it's better than Dark Souls 3.
[236:38.09]Just in regards to... But it's also new.
[236:40.82]And Dark Souls 3 really did kind of feel like they really wanted to end that series.
[236:45.70]So... I loved Dark Souls 3, but I think this is probably a better game than Dark Souls 3.
[236:54.44]In regards to just overall package.
[237:00.09]I think it's better than Dark Souls 3, but I think it's not as good as Bloodborne.
[237:05.51]I'm very biased on that.
[237:06.63]Bloodborne is a full straight up 10 out of 10 for me.
[237:14.09]With or without the DLC for Dark Souls 3?
[237:15.75]The DLC in Dark Souls 3 was cool.
[237:17.59]The ice area was really cool.
[237:27.37]Was the game harder as a whole?
[237:29.01]I think so.
[237:31.00]Because this game forces you to play the game the way that they want you to play it.
[237:36.04]In all those Dark Souls and Soulsborne games, you can approach any situation however you want.
[237:42.88]You can put on a full set of armor, you can hide behind a shield, you can use iframes, you can do iframe abuse.
[237:49.37]You can build a certain character based on one-shotting bosses.
[237:52.67]You can't do that here.
[237:54.33]You can go grind souls and go over level for a boss.
[237:57.73]Can't do that here either.
[237:59.93]So I think this is much harder than any of the Souls games, just because you could build an entire character and grind to beat any boss in, like, three hits.
[238:12.38]So in that regard, I think this is five to ten times harder than any of the Souls games.
[238:16.43]Not because, like, the game is harder, but because you can't play it the way that you want.
[238:20.27]You have to play this game.
[238:21.95]You have to do it the way that they want you to.
[238:24.71]And if you don't, you're dead.
[238:26.73]Good.
[238:27.01]See you later.
[238:38.14]I don't like the over-leveling shit, I think this game makes for better bosses and balance.
[238:42.89]That's true, but you also, you have to understand though, is a lot of people kind of just want to play it, and if something's really too fucking hard, like, sometimes you'll hit a wall and it's just like, I can't, and no summoning, no co-op.
[238:56.98]How many people do you know that played through the Dark Souls games that had to do bosses with partners?
[239:06.95]You can't, you have to, you have to play it.
[239:17.33]Bunch of casuals.
[239:18.43]Yeah, but like I said, when I was in the middle of this last fight, what's the percentage of people that are going to beat that?
[239:26.38]What is it, somebody said that the demon of hatred was what, 6% of players that have the game on Steam?
[239:32.04]That have that achievement?
[239:33.58]That's not very much.
[239:37.15]That is so small of a percentage of people that have the game.
[239:41.83]And it did just come up, that's true.
[239:43.03]But I don't think that number will get any more than... I don't think that number will go higher than like 20 or 30%.
[239:52.50]It's about 2% for Yixing right now.
[239:54.86]Wow.
[239:56.40]So, I mean, so... Yeah, I know the philosophy is get good, get good.
[240:00.68]But maybe some people don't really want to.
[240:03.90]You know, what if you only have like a couple hours to like really sit down and play a game?
[240:08.77]You know, I just got off of work and I got to grind and get good.
[240:14.10]It can be hard.
[240:15.20]So that's why stuff like the co-op, having a friend come in and play with like a party.
[240:22.81]being able to overlevel yourself just to kind of play it.
[240:25.95]Now you could say, well, that's not the way the game is supposed to be played, but judging by the percentages that you see, some people have to do it like that.
[240:40.82]But in all those regards, all those things that we talked about, that's why this game I think is much harder.
[240:46.60]It has nothing really to do with the game's physical mechanics as much as you have to play the way the game tells you to.
[240:52.39]No friends.
[240:53.73]No fucking item abuse.
[240:55.51]No iframe abuse.
[240:56.51]You gotta fucking do it.
[240:58.15]And it can be very frustrating.
[240:59.37]Very.
[240:59.91]Listen to me talking.
[241:00.53]Very frustrating.
[241:02.51]Alright.
[241:04.37]If you choose to start playthrough 2 now, you may do so by accessing the large sculptor's idol in the... Is there anything left I could do?
[241:15.97]Well, that's New Game Plus.
[241:20.69]Well, I'm not gonna start it now.
[241:23.07]Oh, there are other headlesses.
[241:29.34]Oh, he's still alive!
[241:31.60]You're still alive!
[241:32.44]Well, let me bring everybody back to life one more time.
[241:42.86]Oh, there we go.
[241:43.30]Start playthrough 2.
[241:49.43]Ishina Shina at 2% is the bad ending.
[241:53.61]Not Sword Saint Ishina, who is at 8%, okay.
[241:56.09]That's still very little.
[242:10.28]There's an optional boss in the estate.
[242:14.41]Let me see.
[242:15.94]221 total deaths.
[242:17.72]52 deaths at Isshin.
[242:19.62]Damn.
[242:22.82]52.
[242:22.90]That's so many.
[242:25.80]I can't believe I kept my fucking composure and kept going.
[242:33.04]So 220.
[242:36.48]God.
[242:36.88]How did you guys put up with me for that long?
[242:40.91]Seriously.
[242:42.71]I hope I wasn't too fucking obnoxious during that.
[242:45.39]Seriously.
[242:48.87]I can imagine.
[242:49.87]I was probably so fucking annoying.
[242:51.21]I hate doing that.
[242:53.74]But it's just frustration coming out.
[242:55.00]I don't mean fucking any of it.
[243:11.56]I muted you for a while.
[243:15.20]I'm sorry.
[243:17.18]It was fucking fun, though.
[243:25.81]If you gotta do what you gotta do.
[243:28.57]Thanks for still sticking around and watching, though.
[243:30.29]Appreciate that.
[243:35.11]I had to get good, and I tried, and I did.
[243:37.71]So, 220 deaths.
[243:39.18]I was gonna do a scratch ticket for every death.
[243:41.10]I'm not buying 220 $1 scratch tickets.
[243:46.54]That'll take two weeks to scratch them.
[243:50.84]So, we're gonna do, like, fives or something.
[243:53.53]Yeah, we'll do five.
[243:54.29]Wait, hold on.
[243:54.67]How many is that?
[243:56.39]That's still a ton.
[243:58.17]What about $10 tickets?
[244:01.65]The higher the denomination goes, guys, the more chance to win.
[244:04.96]You don't win shit with a $1 scratch ticket.
[244:09.79]No, I'm not going to scratch 220 tickets.
[244:13.49]Do you understand how fucking much, how stupid that is?
[244:17.11]That'll take two or three straight streams.
[244:18.94]That's going to be like 15 hours.
[244:22.86]22 $10 tickets and one $1 ticket.
[244:27.06]Or 44 $5 books.
[244:29.76]Depends.
[244:32.56]And I still have to make sure that that's like a legal thing to do for Terms of Service.
[244:35.95]Because then whatever happens from there goes into community subs.
[244:44.27]It's going to be called Sekiro Scratch Off for community subs.
[244:47.13]It's going to have to be a whole stream.
[244:49.23]It really is.
[244:49.97]That's going to be the weirdest stream.
[245:04.40]Or Charity.
[245:04.96]Yeah, that's probably a better idea.
[245:07.52]Whatever I get from the Scratch Offs is going right to Charity.
[245:13.53]That's better.
[245:19.59]Alright, I think that's it for this.
[245:23.57]Gambling for charity for Sekiro death.
[245:28.50]People are going to stumble into that stream and just be like, what the fuck is this guy doing?
[245:35.18]Oh, right, right.
[245:35.62]There's a boss apparently that I missed.
[245:37.34]Let's just go look at it.
[245:42.30]Dude, imagine if I won like 50 grand.
[245:46.98]That would be an awesome charitable donation there.
[245:52.15]Imagine winning like 100 grand on one of those tickets.
[245:57.49]Did you do the ape fights?
[245:59.15]Yeah, I did both of them.
[246:02.39]But there was one here, right?
[246:03.85]Let me just take a look.
[246:12.56]It won't be as weird as the Labo streams?
[246:15.64]What?
[246:16.70]Why were the Labo streams weird?
[246:20.11]Just because I got shit-faced and started, like, karate-kicking the camera?
[246:25.21]Alright, let me... I'm gonna just run around.
[246:26.53]I know there was something.
[246:33.44]Is that weird, or is that just, like, a Saturday, you know?
[246:38.94]Oh, where... No, it's with the... The flute guys, right?
[246:50.73]Do the lake headless?
[246:52.53]I did the lake headless already, didn't I?
[246:53.93]The one that was in the water there?
[246:57.51]Did the dog just kill me?
[247:11.13]I don't think I'm in the right spot.
[247:16.98]Ugh.
[247:20.29]I think it's a different one.
[247:24.27]Flower Viewing, Great Sakura.
[247:27.61]No, what is this one?
[247:31.69]Oh, 222 Scratch Sticks.
[247:33.35]No, this don't count anymore. 221.
[247:49.49]My relaxation is starting to kick in.
[247:52.59]I'm like, ugh.
[247:54.35]Ugh, I did it.
[247:58.67]What a fucking tough game.
[248:05.24]Where are we going?
[248:10.42]Did I fight owl?
[248:11.18]Yeah, I think I did all the optional major bosses.
[248:18.01]Now, I feel like, because I ran through this.
[248:21.33]Come on, crouch!
[248:25.21]Crouch, what the fuck is happening?
[248:30.75]Oh, oh yeah, I rage unbounded.
[248:38.66]Why can I not, no, that's the wrong one.
[248:43.84]Oh, what a psycho.
[248:46.14]God.
[248:46.50]I hate being, like, rage streamer.
[248:49.45]Like, I don't like it, but it's alright.
[248:52.77]Sometimes you have to have some of those moments.
[248:54.49]Where, uh, where is this guy?
[248:55.75]I think there's only, no, is this guy that guy?
[249:16.18]Oh, no, they're Lightning.
[249:17.14]They're Lightning.
[249:40.03]Oh!
[249:42.89]I probably can just run through this, to be honest.
[250:00.84]Yeah, dude.
[250:01.34]Okay, for the people that just came here, I can't do it.
[250:04.30]I've been stuck here for two straight days.
[250:06.92]This stealth section is so irritating.
[250:09.69]I can't fucking do it.
[250:13.41]I don't know what to do.
[250:14.09]I don't know where to go.
[250:15.19]It's just so fucked up, man.
[250:22.56]Right.
[250:22.82]Okay, so I didn't... Wait a minute.
[250:27.48]Did I go down here?
[250:33.14]Yeah, I don't think I'm gonna be able to complete this.
[250:41.08]Oh, is it Gord's Seed?
[250:44.15]Alright, relax.
[250:54.31]That was weird, I really got clipped inside of him.
[251:00.43]First impression?
[251:01.81]I don't like the stealth part.
[251:25.85]Doesn't like stealth in a samurai game.
[251:28.37]I don't like this part.
[251:30.89]I don't like it.
[251:37.76]Stop banding people.
[251:38.56]Somebody actually... I didn't mention it because I was just kind of... I was kind of tilted during the last fight.
[251:44.66]Last boss.
[251:46.10]But somebody said...
[251:50.20]I'm gonna paraphrase it here, but they said, damn, he's getting so salty.
[251:54.04]I wonder if he's gonna actually start banning people.
[251:56.20]You know, like, look over and see somebody be like, oh, dude, you suck.
[252:09.72]It's already salty.
[252:11.20]When is he gonna start to actually ban somebody?
[252:13.03]Never done that before.
[252:15.08]We make jokes on this channel all the time about... Oh yeah, like, get banned.
[252:19.79]It's a permanent ban and it's like 10 seconds, right?
[252:22.27]It's a joke.
[252:23.74]I've never done that before.
[252:26.22]Imagine.
[252:38.46]Just getting so upset and just so just tilted and enraged That like somebody says something that I just like fucking shut up and like ban somebody No, I don't know if it would ever get there That's the thing I don't Whenever I get upset at a game, I don't take it out on other people.
[252:58.35]I take it out on like myself Mostly Like I'll say like what the fuck what an idiot like that was a bad move.
[253:08.86]But I don't think I would ever, like, be so angry that I would, like, tell, like, a viewer, like, you're wrong, shut the fuck up.
[253:17.16]Like, I don't know why I would do that.
[253:26.52]Have I ever been banned?
[253:33.75]Like, from, you mean from, like, a chat?
[253:37.13]Uh...
[253:42.11]Um, I, no, I don't think so.
[253:52.36]Alright, this is the place that I didn't go to.
[253:56.42]This, oh my god, he's looking over here.
[253:58.84]No, we're fine.
[254:01.24]Um, this is gonna, will this work?
[254:06.18]Because I feel like I'm gonna do this and then I gotta put the shuriken on.
[254:14.33]Because, alright, if you get to that point, right?
[254:16.19]Let's say you get to a point where you're really actually starting to get mad at viewers.
[254:20.53]And like telling people like to fuck off and shit and start banning people.
[254:23.13]The cycle is just gonna go in a... It's gonna be horrible.
[254:26.31]Because nobody likes to hear that like, you know, nobody wants to be told like, hey, shut the fuck up, guys.
[254:32.49]It's like, whoa, come on, man.
[254:34.21]And then all of a sudden, like people start to get angry at you being angry at them.
[254:39.95]And then they get angry at you and you start to... It just cascades.
[254:51.20]Alright, so, I didn't go over here last time.
[254:57.16]That's why even if I do, like, look over and see something that somebody says something that's, like, mean or something... For the most part, I know that people are just fucking around.
[255:06.98]And I wouldn't want to, like, escalate something just because somebody was like, dude, you, like, gotta suck at this.
[255:11.58]It's like, eh... Alright.
[255:15.01]Alright, whatever.
[255:28.07]Because I know a large portion of why I'm upset is because I'm not doing well, right?
[255:34.13]So... If I looked over right now and saw, holy shit, you suck.
[255:39.96]It's like... Hey, I suck, hey, fuck you!
[255:45.48]It's like, you know, jokey.
[255:47.06]But when you're mad, when you're angry, and you look over, there's a very high chance that that same message...
[255:54.32]Instead of making you laugh, we'll be like, I don't even know what it's like.
[255:58.82]It's hard.
[255:59.26]This is a fucking hard game.
[256:01.28]No, you're wrong.
[256:04.60]But I obviously never want to get to that point because I like to have fun here and not get fucking pissed off and hate streaming or something.
[256:14.17]We didn't ask for your life story.
[256:16.69]Yeah, you did.
[256:17.27]Alright, where is this thing that I'm supposed to be finding?
[256:25.69]This is the only place I didn't really explore.
[256:27.39]I sprinted through it after I decided to play.
[256:44.16]What am I looking for?
[256:44.72]I'm looking for the boss.
[256:48.73]There's a boss somewhere around here.
[256:50.71]That's what somebody told me, at least.
[257:00.54]Go to the idol and take a left.
[257:04.03]I've already cleared so much.
[257:17.53]Well, it was cool to see everything.
[257:18.69]Ooh, wait.
[257:21.88]I think I found it.
[257:31.52]It's right there!
[257:45.53]That's the noise!
[257:46.45]Okay, that's the noise that was... Remember we were over here before and everyone was... MonkaS-ing?
[257:53.28]There was like a bunch of MonkaS.
[257:55.52]From the loud noises.
[257:56.46]So I have to go... Around this building.
[257:59.39]So it really is just kind of to the right here.
[258:04.88]The Great Lord Walden just gave 20 community subs.
[258:12.82]Thank you, Great Lord Walden.
[258:19.75]That's an insane amount of subs.
[258:29.65]Thank you.
[258:29.97]I think I missed bits and shit too during that whole process.
[258:32.81]I'm sorry if I missed a lot of money.
[258:35.83]Did I beat the game?
[258:36.41]I did.
[258:36.87]I'm just kind of going back and cleaning up some stuff just to see it.
[258:42.68]So this is not the right idol.
[258:43.98]Uh, what is the idol?
[258:54.74]It's this one.
[258:57.14]No, it is.
[258:57.48]It is.
[258:57.76]I...
[259:13.48]Okay, I'm on the roof.
[259:15.46]Wasn't... wasn't it, like, right here?
[259:36.37]No, it's this way, right?
[259:38.31]It's, like, straight ahead here.
[259:55.52]No, that's not it?
[260:02.38]JermaLiedAboutMinecraftVR.
[260:03.88]Five more community subs.
[260:05.50]Thank you.
[260:11.23]I feel like I've done completely wrong.
[260:19.91]Have I lost my goddamn mind?
[260:23.19]There's none.
[260:23.55]It's right here.
[260:25.58]So the idol's right there.
[260:27.42]The bowl is right here.
[260:41.75]Here?
[260:44.31]I'm sorry.
[260:45.97]I'm like... I know he's like right here somewhere.
[260:52.49]Here?
[260:52.83]I found it.
[260:53.63]Right here.
[260:55.34]Oh, Jesus.
[260:56.08]Okay.
[260:57.62]I thought he was caged up.
[261:00.28]He's just free to be here out on the bright side.
[261:09.10]I wish I found this earlier.
[261:10.18]That's a lot of money.
[261:11.94]Okay, well, he has terror shit on his head, so let's... Let's get that out of the way.
[261:27.67]Let's see.
[261:27.97]Did he just shoot an arrow at me?
[261:38.76]Somebody is shooting an arrow at me.
[261:41.30]Oh.
[261:43.04]Right.
[261:48.17]The guy up on the roof.
[261:49.67]Okay.
[261:50.19]Well, maybe I gotta clear the roof then before I do this.
[261:53.55]It's pretty clear at this point.
[261:54.63]Maybe not.
[262:15.36]Oh, here comes another lottery ticket.
[262:19.52]What am I doing?
[262:20.38]No, it's not even... No?
[262:26.06]You don't count as a beast?
[262:28.98]Why did it not work the first time?
[262:31.42]Really?
[262:31.84]You're not a beast?
[262:34.03]Bullshit.
[262:35.09]You're an animal.
[262:35.89]Oh.
[262:53.69]Probably should start parrying these things.
[263:05.33]No, just dodge.
[263:33.64]No, not the place I wanna be.
[263:44.80]Ow.
[263:53.00]Come here.
[263:54.46]Come here, dog.
[263:55.36]Oh, out of gourds.
[264:19.58]He's out of gourds.
[264:24.10]That really isn't even any terror.
[264:29.77]Oops.
[264:30.43]Okay, I'm getting really, really dumb here.
[264:34.19]Oh, I'm getting real dumb.
[264:58.54]Mmm, round and round we go!
[265:11.10]Stay right up his ass.
[265:17.08]Ooh, he kind of popped me there.
[265:34.07]Oh my god, I just looked over a chat!
[265:36.39]I saw somebody say Thanos!
[265:38.32]Whoa, what the fuck am I doing, man?
[265:42.74]I just got like... I keep giving him such a good opportunity to hit me.
[265:57.53]Just stay behind him.
[266:11.21]Uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh, uh-oh!
[266:27.66]Ooh, that hurts!
[266:35.95]I got you!
[266:37.79]Haha!
[266:44.14]Oh.
[266:45.04]That would have been nice.
[266:45.64]That would have been nice to have.
[266:55.60]What is it, 16?
[266:56.34]That's not really that big of a deal.
[266:57.72]Cool.
[266:58.18]Alright.
[267:04.49]Hold on.
[267:04.79]Let me get this.
[267:07.93]Pellets.
[267:09.75]Finally beat the palace.
[267:11.49]No, guys, I'm just grinding.
[267:14.67]I can't do it.
[267:16.22]The boss in here?
[267:17.48]No, I'm just trying to grind for beads.
[267:27.70]I did, okay, talk about areas.
[267:31.14]This area was my favorite.
[267:34.25]Not that part over there.
[267:35.31]Not that part.
[267:36.25]This part.
[267:37.53]Actually, not this part either.
[267:38.69]Not the stealth part.
[267:40.09]The part where you walk down the mountain.
[267:43.26]So pretty much this is not my favorite zone.
[267:45.10]I just like the way it looks.
[267:49.84]Worst area, in my opinion, just in regards to how hard it was for me to do, that optional zone leading up to the Demon of Hatred.
[268:05.26]It just was kind of brutal going through that.
[268:08.44]And... I'm trying to think of other areas that I had just trouble with.
[268:23.06]This area was hard to do and it was kind of frustrating with the weird lightning guys and people that can kick the ball at you.
[268:29.56]But I don't know if this is the worst area.
[268:41.69]Well, I'm here.
[268:42.29]I might as well just try.
[268:49.35]Isn't there a headless down here?
[268:55.72]Yeah, they're right here.
[269:00.30]Ow.
[269:11.09]I actually don't really need Confetti here, huh?
[269:13.43]Oh, I'm dead.
[269:18.99]I'm not gonna use that.
[269:27.86]Tag Team Headless.
[269:28.78]You know, before... I've already seen the end of the tunnel.
[269:32.74]This doesn't even bother me anymore.
[269:38.52]Nothing can compare to that final fight.
[269:40.12]Like, it doesn't even matter.
[269:41.41]This is just, like, funny now.
[269:44.53]This is like... This is a comedy.
[269:52.31]Whatever this is, I didn't get it.
[269:57.63]Didn't even use any sugar or anything.
[269:59.05]I was just... I... Remember I... I...
[270:04.28]You see, the last boss and even the Demon of Hatred.
[270:07.64]Use the items, use the candy, use this, use this, you gotta do it, man.
[270:10.46]Imagine if I had stopped and used, like, the candy in that third phase, thinking I should've.
[270:22.01]I would've probably died.
[270:25.55]My brain is just... My brain is fucking just a mess.
[270:37.22]Alright, so we got this guy.
[270:39.38]He does... how many swings?
[270:47.67]The other one's throwing shit at me now.
[270:51.61]Whoa!
[270:52.09]That goes across the whole place, huh?
[271:00.52]Um, I wonder if I should kill the illusion first.
[271:08.70]Let's see.
[271:09.62]How hard, how annoying are you?
[271:11.44]Yeah, you got way less health.
[271:16.36]You're just annoying.
[271:17.88]Okay.
[271:18.30]Relax.
[271:18.96]Alright.
[271:23.66]I can't take this down here?
[271:40.97]I can't- oh, I can't use that.
[271:45.31]Alright, well... Now get out.
[271:59.66]He's almost dead.
[272:09.88]There it is!
[272:11.16]One down.
[272:18.14]Okay, now I wonder... I'm already almost dead.
[272:31.03]They don't respawn, do they?
[272:41.22]Oh, I'm running into walls.
[272:52.33]Oh boy, see you later.
[272:59.27]Surprise!
[273:02.70]Oh my god, what am I doing?
[273:06.66]I'm dead.
[273:08.98]Goodbye.
[273:21.67]Actually, I might be able to get it if he does the grab again.
[273:24.87]Alright, no health.
[273:41.08]No!
[273:50.87]Game sucks.
[273:51.79]Game sucks.
[273:52.77]Game sucks.
[273:53.69]Game sucks.
[273:56.51]Been a while since I heard that.
[274:08.58]Mad because bad.
[274:09.60]Mad because gab.
[274:11.05]Gab.
[274:12.35]Gabby?
[274:12.77]I don't know.
[274:15.79]They're both back.
[274:17.15]Game actually sucks.
[274:38.02]What?
[274:40.14]What?
[274:55.09]No, god damn it.
[274:56.04]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[274:58.38]Underwater level suck.
[274:59.54]Underwater level suck.
[275:00.68]Underwater level suck.
[275:01.70]They always suck.
[275:02.48]Always suck.
[275:12.74]Because, like, I had... Look at this shit.
[275:13.92]Like, get me up here.
[275:21.37]And then I'll... I'm just gonna bait the, uh...
[275:40.60]Just bait the grab and you get free hits on him.
[275:50.81]Grab me.
[275:52.89]Grab me!
[276:08.70]Ding.
[276:11.22]Yeah, you're not so bad, are you?
[276:17.22]Not so bad.
[276:22.86]Oh, that's a double terror.
[276:24.36]Come on, grab me.
[276:31.61]Fine, I'll just do it to you.
[276:35.61]Again with this shit.
[276:38.14]My god I was just getting bored there.
[276:46.51]I'll be honest waiting for a goddamn grab and I had my health is so low What the hell am I doing?
[276:58.12]Like that was just like I'm just sitting there waiting for him to do a move and I'm looking at my health bar I
[277:06.63]He's gonna do the fucking, like, magic missile spam three times.
[277:19.23]Yeah, he's a stationary target.
[277:20.41]Don't you guys understand?
[277:21.07]The people that move the slowest, I may as well just give up.
[277:26.51]The slower you are, the harder you are for me to play in these games.
[277:29.53]You could telegraph a move for 15 straight, like, now I'm just getting angry again.
[277:37.63]Like these slow, slug-ass fucking people.
[277:41.13]Takes them like three full, five full seconds to move.
[277:45.62]You just sit there with like your fucking hand up your ass, waiting for them to do something.
[278:05.36]He telegraphed the whole way around.
[278:08.95]Oh, fucking headless man.
[278:11.17]This dude's not even hard.
[278:12.61]It's not even hard.
[278:16.94]I'm making it so much more difficult.
[278:36.12]God, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die, die.
[279:07.35]Seriously, it's not even a fun game.
[279:09.27]That's the problem I have.
[279:12.51]The game was a 9, and this shit is just part of the reason why I... Oh my god, okay, no more jokes, I have to hit him once.
[279:39.57]Hey, you got it.
[279:44.63]No, actually, Kim also baked cookies, and she said, hey, do you want some cookies?
[279:51.24]From 9 to 1.
[279:52.12]There it is.
[279:54.66]Oh, the game's not even fun.
[279:56.86]Has anyone ever said that?
[279:57.85]This game's not even fun.
[280:00.67]Any other streamers?
[280:13.68]These are actually pretty good.
[280:18.29]So that's the sugar.
[280:18.99]Oh, these are good.
[280:22.39]Hey, thank you.
[280:22.99]These are like oatmeal.
[280:30.38]Hot!
[280:30.76]Hot!
[280:31.62]Oh, my mouth!
[280:32.36]Ow!
[280:35.90]I'm just kidding.
[280:49.94]Alright, I think we- did I clean up everything?
[280:53.07]This is like the Sekiro cleanup.
[280:55.17]Before Picross.
[280:57.77]Get away from me!
[280:59.35]Get away from me!
[280:59.81]It's not even fun!
[281:11.30]The big fish?
[281:11.88]Can you kill the big fish?
[281:23.11]Interesting.
[281:34.85]So yeah, I do have bait.
[281:36.07]Let me see.
[281:40.47]Is it a consumable?
[281:41.23]Or is this blind streamer that already went by?
[281:44.37]What do you think?
[281:53.31]Is that a case?
[281:54.41]That is the case, isn't it?
[282:11.80]What is happening?
[282:14.54]Oh, it's a key item.
[282:17.80]You guys got me here.
[282:19.52]Got me thinking I'm insane.
[282:29.98]This is precious bait.
[282:32.40]Something resembling horns seem to be jutting out of it.
[282:34.20]Just the kind of bait the master loves.
[282:35.86]Ring the bell, drop the bait.
[282:41.90]What the hell does that mean?
[282:44.67]I can't even select this.
[283:00.19]Is there a spot where I can put this?
[283:02.01]How did I miss this?
[283:10.22]In his cave?
[283:29.99]Well, here's the... This is where he came from, right?
[283:35.08]So he jumped and crashed here.
[283:36.44]Is there something I can do up here?
[283:46.81]Bait?
[283:51.05]Bait?
[283:52.03]Bait?
[283:55.95]Find a way to the roof.
[283:56.91]Spawn at the palace grounds and find a way to the roof.
[284:00.67]Why don't I just fuckin' get on the roof right now?
[284:02.99]Like this.
[284:03.37]That was an accidental button press.
[284:20.31]Oops-a-daisy.
[284:21.35]Oops.
[284:21.87]He's not gonna get back up there, is he?
[284:24.21]Nope.
[284:24.45]Uh-oh, cocks!
[284:28.50]Really?
[284:29.00]That's not good.
[284:31.02]Whoa!
[284:32.04]Whoa, whoa, whoa!
[284:33.12]I just got a surge of, like... Wow, what's happening right now?
[284:39.16]Alright, that was weird.
[284:40.71]So I have my... I stream at 6,000 up.
[284:46.07]And for a few seconds right there, I just had 11,000 up.
[284:50.81]I don't know how that happened.
[284:52.39]That was weird.
[285:00.61]Alright, get me up there.
[285:11.16]Really?
[285:17.17]Okay, top of the castle.
[285:18.61]Which side should I get up here?
[285:21.85]Uh, you know what?
[285:23.69]Let's just skip this shit.
[285:34.23]Did I already finish?
[285:35.09]Yeah, I did.
[285:37.35]I'm just going back and checking out some of the optional stuff that I missed.
[285:40.48]Alright.
[285:53.64]This one?
[285:54.40]This one.
[285:55.29]This one.
[285:56.37]This one thinks that Johnny Cage.
[285:59.79]This one says
[286:07.73]uh main hall which one's at the top inner sanctum oh no no no no I'm in the wrong place which one of these great sacro or palace grounds I think palace friends
[286:37.37]Picross isn't going to help.
[286:38.35]This is I can't graduate fourth grade level mistakes.
[286:45.85]Oh, give it.
[286:46.41]Come on.
[286:49.94]Alright.
[286:51.54]We're at the top.
[286:53.80]There's like a canister here.
[286:54.98]Put it in here.
[287:00.02]Fourth grade.
[287:07.08]What?
[287:07.58]Did I walk into your sword?
[287:08.94]No, okay, I thought for a second.
[287:10.30]That was weird.
[287:11.70]That guy hit me with an arrow.
[287:19.88]Alright, we're at the top of the palace.
[287:24.69]So... If I'm a place to put bait... Down there?
[287:40.43]I don't think I did very much exploring over here.
[287:43.63]Like that way.
[287:44.19]Hmm.
[287:53.34]How would I... Can I get up there on the roof?
[288:00.59]I don't think there's a grappling point up here.
[288:08.51]Alright, well I'm up here.
[288:13.79]Can I make this jump?
[288:17.75]I think I tried this before.
[288:19.01]It didn't work.
[288:35.33]Is there a branch?
[288:44.45]I don't see a bridge over here.
[288:55.00]But where's the, there's no indicator.
[288:56.40]I feel like I'm not, do you notice I don't see an indicator?
[289:22.79]Do I like the cookies?
[289:23.39]The cookies are great.
[289:24.47]I don't think I can reach the... God damn it.
[289:27.05]Whatever.
[289:27.95]Just... Quickly!
[289:34.12]That takes so much longer than any other soul software game.
[289:56.57]Okay, let's try this again.
[290:00.00]What am I eating?
[290:00.50]Uh, I went outside and I took a shovel and I brought some dirt in here and I figured I would chew on it for a while and like swallow it and shit.
[290:25.27]sure I sure I don't know I'm confused grapple from the bonfire area like back here definitely from back here
[290:56.08]on the roof of this building?
[291:02.35]We didn't ask you for your life story.
[291:04.61]Yes, but... Is there a point I can get to from here?
[291:07.39]I don't see anything from here.
[291:08.23]Do I have to go around here?
[291:10.95]Probably around this way.
[291:19.20]Right?
[291:24.34]I don't see a place to go.
[291:30.33]Ah, right there.
[291:32.83]Fuck, I can't get there from here.
[291:41.76]Do I have to jump?
[291:43.76]Oh, hold on.
[291:45.64]Really?
[291:45.90]That's kind of... That'd be really difficult to know to do that.
[291:52.02]No, I was going to say just jump over.
[292:01.65]Like jump out, you know what I mean?
[292:06.83]No.
[292:24.01]There it is.
[292:24.27]Just had to go through the building.
[292:26.81]Journalite about Minecraft VR.
[292:29.51]Five more community subs.
[292:30.96]Adding to your total there.
[292:32.84]Thank you so much.
[292:37.46]Alright, now... Now I can reach this tree.
[292:42.76]Almost didn't fucking get it.
[292:44.08]That was really close.
[292:48.06]Alright, here we go.
[292:53.29]Oh.
[292:59.07]That would have been bad in midair.
[293:01.87]Thank god I had forward momentum.
[293:05.85]Yeah.
[293:08.54]Will you just stop doing that and just bite me?
[293:23.27]Alright.
[293:30.21]So let's keep going across.
[293:38.48]What am I up to now?
[293:39.46]I am just doing exploring areas that I didn't get to see the whole thing, fighting optional bosses that I missed, doing optional content, that kind of thing.
[293:49.44]So now there's no grapple point here.
[293:56.36]I guess I'm just going to go over this way.
[294:03.70]This is all the way across.
[294:06.32]Leads to down here.
[294:12.11]Oh, is it just a bridge?
[294:13.15]Do I just go to the bridge?
[294:14.21]I'm just going to go to the bridge.
[294:18.09]It looks like a place I haven't gone.
[294:21.57]Oops.
[294:31.00]I mean, that...
[294:33.64]That looks about right.
[294:45.75]Okay.
[294:47.45]So... What does this do for me?
[294:58.44]Is it not this bridge?
[295:17.38]Oh, fuck!
[295:19.30]Oh my god, this- I remember seeing this guy!
[295:23.20]Right, okay, I remember this.
[295:24.56]Remember I looked over here and I was like, who's that guy?
[295:27.56]Okay, cool.
[295:34.64]I never even- I just went right by it.
[295:39.94]There's the bell.
[295:45.16]Noble fish.
[295:50.39]Master, I call it.
[295:57.58]Feed the fish.
[295:59.58]The bell must be rung.
[296:07.97]OK, the bell must be rung.
[296:12.27]I only have four of these.
[296:14.05]So... What happens when I do this?
[296:16.41]Is he going to jump up here and I have to shoot him in the head?
[296:18.29]Am I about to play duck hunt with a fish?
[296:26.18]Here he is.
[296:27.10]Alright, how do I feed him?
[296:29.64]Use precious bait.
[296:31.14]Here you go.
[296:36.97]How much is it?
[296:41.48]Do I have to do it again?
[296:43.20]Feed it again?
[296:43.74]Wow.
[296:51.74]I did it.
[297:12.06]I like this guy.
[297:12.64]We will be rewarded.
[297:17.04]Feed the fish.
[297:18.64]Treasure carps.
[297:19.28]Okay.
[297:21.48]We gotta do it again.
[297:22.42]We have to do it.
[297:22.76]We're gonna do it again.
[297:24.34]Wait, let me ask.
[297:24.88]Let me talk to him one more time.
[297:28.20]Feed it.
[297:28.60]Feed it.
[297:28.94]Feed it.
[297:29.10]We're gonna keep feeding it.
[297:31.24]Let's see what happens if we do it twice.
[297:32.34]Alright, here you go.
[297:38.73]Have some more.
[297:43.00]He's got human teeth.
[297:44.26]That's just weird.
[297:47.70]He's got, like, dentures in.
[297:59.42]No scale.
[298:06.01]Again.
[298:06.25]This is fun.
[298:15.41]What do I get for doing that?
[298:20.78]Another scale?
[298:27.82]Gross fat!
[298:32.59]Wait, say that again?
[298:34.09]He's gonna get fat?
[298:42.42]So why do I feed him again?
[298:43.42]Let's feed him again.
[298:48.73]Get it again.
[298:51.33]Have some more.
[298:51.89]No, stop feeding.
[299:01.31]I'm fucking frames and dying right now, I'm bad.
[299:06.42]Ask us to eat.
[299:10.73]Go back to pot guy.
[299:12.89]Who's pot guy?
[299:14.57]Pot guy.
[299:17.81]Pot guy?
[299:18.45]Damn, what's going on with my internet?
[299:24.47]It's crazy.
[299:24.83]It's like surging all over the place.
[299:26.03]I'm going to like 2,000 up to like 12,000 up.
[299:31.05]It's going crazy.
[299:37.45]The fish scale pot guys give you more bait.
[299:44.89]Are you guys talking about the guy that's in the trash can?
[299:52.76]Talk to the guys in the pots.
[300:00.94]There's one, two in this area, but it's well hidden.
[300:04.44]Where is it here?
[300:09.07]Am I warm, or do I need to go to another idol?
[300:17.23]Because I have no idea where the hell he is.
[300:25.25]All the way on the right?
[300:26.65]So what are you talking about?
[300:29.10]My right or his right?
[300:31.56]You know what I mean?
[300:32.82]Like that way?
[300:33.56]Alright.
[300:34.56]My right or his right?
[300:44.49]My right.
[300:48.20]This way.
[300:49.46]Like over here.
[301:03.90]I said my right.
[301:07.36]I said my right.
[301:18.89]Like over here?
[301:19.41]He's not gonna come in the water.
[301:30.57]What?
[301:31.47]Go to the palace grounds, idle, and then go right after the devildoers.
[301:37.35]Okay.
[301:55.24]Yeah, I'm totally fine with, like, back-sitting and shit right now.
[301:57.04]It's fine.
[301:58.78]The game's over.
[301:59.60]I completed it, so... So go right through the double doors.
[302:06.41]I'm cool if you guys just want to tell me whatever you want.
[302:08.11]It's fine.
[302:09.87]So go right through the double doors.
[302:13.45]And then... Down, like, here?
[302:22.58]Somebody says, I hate you.
[302:25.26]I'm sorry, man.
[302:32.14]Up.
[302:40.87]Up.
[302:42.29]Up.
[302:43.31]Up.
[302:44.23]Up.
[302:45.49]Up.
[302:48.01]Up.
[303:02.30]It's well hidden.
[303:13.88]What the fuck?
[303:14.64]Oh.
[303:17.64]Oh, I see it right here.
[303:18.40]Yeah, that is pretty hidden, isn't it?
[303:22.03]I hate... You know what?
[303:23.01]I hate me too.
[303:24.37]I hate me too.
[303:35.74]It's like the same color as the leaves here, so it can be kind of deceiving.
[303:40.22]And you lose the indicator.
[303:43.20]Ooh!
[303:44.74]Crystal lizards!
[303:59.35]Cool.
[304:01.77]Look at this little hidden zone over here.
[304:03.43]So many secrets.
[304:05.57]I love this.
[304:06.17]Where the hell are you?
[304:19.90]Found him.
[304:23.20]Hello?
[304:24.32]Hello?
[304:25.86]Please.
[304:29.24]I say, have I fought the corrupted monk?
[304:31.58]You know, I probably should just put this here.
[304:34.80]Just because people are probably trickling in and asking about if I beat it or not.
[304:37.66]Let's just do this.
[304:39.02]Because we're just kind of dicking around.
[304:50.68]Game completed.
[304:55.65]Just tying up loose ends.
[305:05.73]There we go.
[305:06.83]No, like... I don't like where that is.
[305:18.19]Right here.
[305:23.69]That's fine.
[305:24.11]That's not horrible looking.
[305:25.19]It looks good.
[305:27.77]Alright, so... Change the title?
[305:34.40]The title is... Yeah, the title is inaccurate.
[305:41.26]We're almost done, though.
[305:50.09]Was I lied to?
[305:58.13]Who lied to me?
[306:07.93]He'll give it to you Um, alright well here Did you bring me You there ignore any requests he makes of you
[306:38.02]The other one.
[306:43.94]So the other one tried to kill the carp.
[306:46.56]So I have to talk to the other one.
[306:48.74]Alright, I'm gonna pick this guy up and throw him down the stairs.
[307:19.35]So I spent like seven scales here.
[307:30.32]Do I have to talk to the other one?
[307:36.78]Talk to the other pod.
[307:39.23]I'm like a messenger for these two.
[307:49.61]Alright, let's go talk to the other one.
[307:53.97]He was at... I always forget where he is.
[307:56.33]Ashina... Not Depths.
[308:00.13]Outskirts?
[308:00.69]Which one is he at?
[308:03.74]Castle Gate?
[308:04.34]He's right somewhere in the beginning.
[308:06.48]I think it's Castle Gate, isn't it?
[308:11.98]Or Ashina Castle?
[308:14.90]That was way off.
[308:22.69]Do you, Dragonspring?
[308:31.41]Pick Ross waiting room.
[308:34.75]Hey.
[308:38.56]Alright, there you are down there.
[308:40.84]There he is, let's go.
[308:54.12]I just fucking pancaked on the ground.
[308:59.84]Do you have any more scales?
[309:03.64]To talk to my brother?
[309:04.86]I wish I could be a carp like him.
[309:12.51]You just broke your weenus.
[309:25.10]It's me, Zabon.
[309:30.00]There it is.
[309:30.88]Truly precious bait.
[309:34.40]If bait has hair, you know it's something truly special.
[309:37.17]The Hirata noble in the pod is obsessed with thoughts of becoming a master.
[309:40.99]He who receives the scale of the carp becomes closer to a carp himself.
[309:44.99]I bestow upon you my secret treasure.
[309:47.93]I will finally become
[310:03.57]Alright.
[310:05.54]Okay, let's go.
[310:07.36]Don't forget to use the bait.
[310:08.74]Let's go talk to the other one.
[310:13.77]What a weird quest line.
[310:36.68]Near Pot Noble.
[310:44.23]He sounds like Bugleberry.
[310:48.83]Hi.
[310:51.31]No, but I want to ask you a question.
[310:52.52]Okay, well, I just have the bait.
[311:07.57]Do I have to do anything else with this guy, or can I just kill the fish?
[311:12.61]How many scales do I need?
[311:17.01]I need three more scales.
[311:19.33]Let's just go fish for him.
[311:26.60]Alright, let's just kill this motherfucker.
[311:28.40]This guy's too pushy.
[311:52.71]Okay.
[311:53.81]Am I gonna enrage this dude?
[311:57.81]There we go.
[312:00.23]Ding ding.
[312:01.39]Come get food.
[312:11.17]Pot Noble Harunaga's Bait.
[312:31.98]Master must not grow fatted.
[312:37.51]Uh... Let's see, okay.
[312:48.89]Oh no.
[312:52.01]Oh no, I feel like this is kinda sad.
[312:58.34]Master...
[313:13.33]I'm sad.
[313:13.77]I, like, wish I didn't do that.
[313:17.09]No, he's so sad.
[313:34.00]Do nothing.
[313:37.38]That's just mean.
[313:39.41]Where, uh, is he in there?
[313:43.27]What do I get for doing that?
[313:45.07]Is he just dead on the ground?
[313:53.23]Go to the... Travel to a different arena?
[313:54.98]The ape boss?
[313:57.02]Is he going to be washed up down... Like, down here?
[313:59.80]This is going to be so sad.
[314:11.35]Oh, the other one.
[314:18.12]Where's the other one?
[314:53.84]Great white whisker a Priceless white whisker taken from the great colored carp while the great carp is naturally immortal if killed its whiskers can be plucked The sound of the whisker being removed is surely magic music to the ears of certain people Some would feel relief at their sound of their mission being completed others the joy of having their hearts desire granted.
[315:15.61]I
[315:23.92]Couldn't go in?
[315:24.78]I know it would be really cool.
[315:25.86]Let me tell you something FromSoftware, take a note here.
[315:30.07]If you walked in here, and it was another zone, an optional zone.
[315:34.83]In like this magic stomach.
[315:42.78]Anything else?
[315:45.66]This is really ridiculous though.
[315:47.24]I feel bad.
[315:55.88]Alright, so I'm assuming I can give the whisker to either the guy that's sad or one of the guys in the trash cans.
[316:03.59]And I think I'm going to give it to the guy that's sad because that's fucked up.
[316:07.70]He spent his whole life with this fish.
[316:09.94]Why would I give it to that guy?
[316:12.22]Why would I give it to the guy that's like, please, I want to be a fish.
[316:15.14]Kill it.
[316:25.31]Why do I keep calling PictoPix Picross?
[316:27.33]Because that's what it's called.
[316:29.93]Picross is the name of the puzzle.
[316:35.67]I have something for you.
[316:38.79]Take it.
[316:54.16]Best
[317:00.14]Yeah, I need to give this guy peace, right?
[317:02.92]You've got to have some closure here.
[317:04.40]Even though I did it.
[317:07.92]This is sick.
[317:09.58]At last.
[317:16.44]At last.
[317:19.52]My duties are complete.
[317:26.15]I am
[317:32.35]Divine Grass.
[317:36.16]That's all I get?
[317:38.72]Alright, full charge fucking slash.
[317:45.47]That huge quest line for a piece of grass, but hold on.
[318:06.00]wait you did this you did this what the hell what did you do to my muppet friend
[318:38.23]Damn.
[318:38.43]Let's rest again.
[319:12.60]Anything else?
[319:16.76]All for some drugs.
[319:17.82]You're a monster.
[319:19.52]But wait!
[319:19.96]Wait!
[319:21.22]He's still around, right?
[319:24.53]There'll be another one.
[319:25.41]It'll be small.
[319:25.97]I thought it was going to be a little koi fish or something.
[319:36.16]Alright, let's go talk to the dumpster guy.
[320:10.62]uh he seems to be out of his dumpster a lapis and there he is what
[320:40.38]How did this work?
[320:41.30]I don't understand how this works.
[320:45.28]So he was in the bucket.
[320:47.19]I killed the carp, and then he becomes carp.
[320:49.37]No.
[320:53.95]Seaman.
[320:54.87]What about the other one?
[321:02.74]I want to talk to the other one.
[321:09.60]It's just like the giant rat.
[321:14.63]Didn't get any of the mask pieces.
[321:16.17]What a shame.
[321:19.11]Alright, we'll get... What are the three... What does it do if you get all three?
[321:22.54]I mean, they're very expensive.
[321:24.46]$5,000, like 12 carps, 12... That's a lot.
[321:28.02]What does it actually do?
[321:39.66]You can level attack power with five levels.
[321:44.58]It turns skill points into attack points.
[321:46.44]Oh, that's kind of useful.
[321:57.42]I'm so confused by what any of this even means.
[322:03.36]He's dead.
[322:04.93]Why?
[322:13.08]There's a boss in there!
[322:15.52]It's a new world!
[322:24.23]Okay, so one lives, one dies.
[322:34.44]Cool.
[322:35.80]Alright.
[322:37.00]Well, I think that's gonna do it.
[322:41.49]Sekiro, I've tied up pretty much most of the loose ends.
[322:55.14]Somebody wants me to go dive in the water here.
[323:03.04]Does it at least see the optional boss in the estate?
[323:06.72]Okay.
[323:08.06]Well, it's in the water.
[323:08.68]This is where the headless is, isn't it?
[323:14.81]Dive in the water here.
[323:15.69]I mean, like, over this way.
[323:25.00]Other way.
[323:29.24]He can't get the estate boss.
[323:30.80]Oh.
[323:31.58]Did I go too far?
[323:38.29]You guys know who Jarva's gonna stream today?
[323:45.93]This is the grave.
[323:46.67]There's two graves here now.
[323:57.92]Pikto picks you.
[323:58.70]Promised.
[324:01.09]I know.
[324:01.97]I know I did.
[324:03.77]Where's this body water?
[324:05.03]Over here?
[324:10.07]I'm gonna look this way.
[324:11.69]Look over here.
[324:34.64]Yeah, no, I killed this already.
[324:36.70]There's one down here.
[324:38.28]Yeah, I already killed this one.
[324:40.46]I already got that one, so I can't do the optional boss in the estate.
[324:52.91]Is the lottery thing still happening?
[324:54.33]If I can do it, yeah.
[325:02.14]So, where in the estate?
[325:04.32]Just out of curiosity.
[325:05.82]See if I can see it.
[325:09.58]Nah, that's not, that's for a different ending.
[325:11.24]Okay.
[325:12.14]Alright.
[325:18.57]So, I've seen pretty much everything I need to see.
[325:20.65]Game's fucking fantastic.
[325:29.57]PictoPix waiting room.
[325:31.53]I thought I was going to be... I think we're just going to call it.
[325:36.22]I think we're just going to call it.
[325:45.78]I'm going to get out of the game.
[325:50.33]And open up PictoPix.
[325:53.69]That's it.
[325:54.41]Colin, Sekiro.
[325:55.97]That's the end.
[326:03.93]Sad because I don't see another playthrough in the future for me.
[326:09.27]Maybe eventually.
[326:18.75]But what an experience it was.
[326:21.95]View the memory.
[326:24.66]What are you talking about here?
[326:35.59]Oh no, never mind.
[326:47.34]Watch the other endings?
[326:48.18]I don't want to do that.
[326:53.65]Because if I ever... If for some reason I ever want to play it again, I kind of want to do a different thing.
[327:03.69]One who returns from the great beyond does so at the peak of their prosperity.
[327:07.55]Isshin coveted strength in all manner of techniques throughout his mortal struggle.
[327:11.43]He wished for war until his final hour, and that is precisely what he got.
[327:16.38]The end.
[327:21.20]The only one that made it out alive was the random vendor.
[327:32.78]I got a new skill too, yeah.
[327:37.66]Where is it?
[327:40.64]Is it a combat art?
[327:41.69]Mortal draw, was this it?
[327:45.87]Which one was it?
[327:46.39]Dragon flash?
[327:50.41]Read us a bedtime story.
[327:55.91]Draw your sword from its sheath, slice at high speed.
[327:59.37]And then holding them is Dragon Flash.
[328:02.01]Draw your sword from a sheet to slice at high speed considering... Alright, let's take a look.
[328:09.39]Ah, that's cool.
[328:16.03]You can charge up, so it's a thing he was doing.
[328:20.25]He's stalling for Picross.
[328:28.06]Okay, one more for the road, okay?
[328:29.58]I'm going to take a break.
[328:30.40]I'm going to grab some water.
[328:34.52]And I'm going to open up Picross.
[328:36.86]Just chill for like an hour or so.
[328:39.54]One more for the road.
[328:56.35]I'll be back.
