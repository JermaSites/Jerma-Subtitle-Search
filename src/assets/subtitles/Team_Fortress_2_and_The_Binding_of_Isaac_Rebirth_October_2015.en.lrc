[ve:60.16.100]

[00:05.14]Am I even live right now?
[00:06.16]I can't even tell.
[00:11.65]Mute just said, Jerma never comes back.
[00:14.49]It should be live, it says I'm streaming.
[00:17.23]Mine does not.
[00:19.57]Am I even live right now?
[00:20.59]I can't even tell.
[00:21.63]Oh, everyone's going, yeah.
[00:23.98]Yeah!
[00:25.02]Yeah!
[00:26.22]Hey, we're back.
[00:28.42]Mute was making fun of you.
[00:30.54]You thought we weren't coming back?
[00:34.01]When I see something like that, I see somebody telling, you know, he never comes back.
[00:38.25]We're back.
[00:39.21]Okay?
[00:42.67]And I'm gonna play Invasion stuff.
[00:44.11]Maybe with... Maybe these guys will play, huh?
[00:48.27]Nope.
[00:50.09]Invasion is so, like, three days ago.
[00:56.41]Have a little bit of fun, man.
[01:00.11]It's all about 20 more hours in Victor Vran.
[01:05.51]I'm still transmuting.
[01:06.79]Tremor, that's bad for your stream.
[01:08.07]You're the worst streamer.
[01:09.37]I, hey, I... I never said I was the best streamer, did I?
[01:14.97]Hey, did you up your bitrate?
[01:16.53]Yes.
[01:18.30]And it was fine, right?
[01:20.38]I think so, yeah.
[01:23.00]He doesn't even know.
[01:23.88]He thinks so.
[01:24.34]From what I remember, from what I can recall.
[01:28.16]Because that stream I did ten minutes ago is a fucking blur.
[01:40.03]Shit.
[01:42.74]Who's your favorite character in TF2?
[01:44.10]The Engineer.
[01:49.24]Not the Scout?
[01:49.90]Who are you looking at?
[01:51.94]Scout's from Boston.
[01:52.64]Jerma Scout.
[01:53.90]No, the Star's the Scout.
[01:55.16]Jerma's the Soldier.
[01:56.04]Why did he do it the wrong way?
[02:00.54]Does this count as the second stream this week?
[02:04.68]Yeah.
[02:05.92]See, this is two in one day.
[02:08.14]Come on.
[02:10.04]It's a lot.
[02:14.98]Been a lot of use out of that recording studio.
[02:20.09]God damn it!
[02:24.69]Fucking pistoled me.
[02:32.81]How does this map even- is- this is the King of the Hill map?
[02:36.63]Which one is it?
[02:37.53]Cough Probe.
[02:40.31]I think I only played on this map for like two minutes.
[02:44.78]Where's the spawns in their respective corners?
[02:49.08]Because that guy was all the way over here.
[02:50.14]I didn't expect to see a scout back here.
[02:53.51]That's the map with engineers on it.
[02:55.35]Oh.
[02:56.69]Well, that's good to know.
[03:08.32]Oh, I get this.
[03:09.00]You're right.
[03:09.48]There was a sentry.
[03:11.20]Told you.
[03:11.52]I'm gonna stay down low.
[03:25.73]So why is the Engineer your favorite Jerma?
[03:28.23]I think he's the best character.
[03:30.96]What?
[03:31.24]I just hit myself.
[03:32.00]That was dumb.
[03:34.18]Because you ate yourself?
[03:36.33]I think he, I don't know, he's just like, for some reason I think he's the most interesting of all the characters in the game.
[03:42.31]Spy is also really interesting, too.
[03:46.72]Can I ask you a question?
[03:47.66]Jeez.
[03:48.88]You haven't talked about this in a while.
[03:51.00]You haven't seemed to really care.
[03:52.94]What?
[03:53.80]Who's your favorite character in Overwatch?
[03:56.78]Bastion.
[03:58.44]Oh, yeah.
[03:59.38]Talked about that before.
[04:00.00]Even after the new guys?
[04:02.52]Yeah, I don't know.
[04:02.98]Bastion just seems...
[04:05.12]I like the sentient robot that is very ambiguous and that's cool.
[04:10.14]Easy!
[04:13.20]You like smart guys, huh, Jerma?
[04:15.50]Bastion?
[04:16.10]Bastion's like a... Well, the engineer's smart, the spy's smart.
[04:19.92]Bastion seems like a robot.
[04:22.66]Who's your favorite World of Warcraft character?
[04:25.25]And don't say the guy that's the boss guy.
[04:27.33]I was gonna say a mug.
[04:32.49]Never mind, I don't know the answer to that question.
[04:33.95]He's going to say a gnome.
[04:35.17]Oh, he's going to say a car.
[04:36.33]Yeah, jacking her car.
[04:39.37]Her car is cool.
[04:41.59]What just killed that guy?
[04:42.71]Sentry?
[04:53.64]Shit.
[04:54.28]Crits.
[04:58.86]If it wasn't Bastion, it would probably be...
[05:04.65]No.
[05:07.25]Time to reap?
[05:08.71]No.
[05:09.07]Reaper?
[05:09.41]Maybe?
[05:11.90]I don't know.
[05:12.98]Hanzo's kind of cool.
[05:15.06]You're getting your money's worth for that stock ambulance footage, aren't you?
[05:21.62]Yeah.
[05:22.56]Oh, that's his neighbor?
[05:23.56]That wasn't cheap.
[05:25.85]He filmed his neighbor dying.
[05:28.65]How dare you.
[05:39.08]Come on.
[05:44.78]Ow, ow, ow, ow, ow.
[05:48.66]Here, I'll... I'm helping.
[05:55.51]Dr. Boom?
[05:57.73]Dr. Boom's your favorite?
[05:58.75]Dr. Boom LOL.
[05:59.77]Dr. Boom LOL credited in my movie.
[06:03.62]Oh yeah, you did do that, didn't you?
[06:05.60]By your request.
[06:07.12]The dumbest joke ever made.
[06:09.79]Let's address that.
[06:10.43]The amount of people, not that, but... The amount of people that thought that that... Ah, I should have shot that.
[06:15.15]I'm gonna die here.
[06:17.53]The amount of people that thought that that was, uh... Like, real?
[06:20.78]Oh my god.
[06:22.92]He filmed, like, an ambulance outside of his house.
[06:25.78]What is he doing?! !
[06:28.63]That was just stock footage.
[06:30.27]It wasn't me filming that.
[06:35.17]You know.
[06:37.27]You died!
[06:37.65]I really do miss contracts.
[06:51.76]I miss having something to do.
[06:53.28]Every time I walk out of this fucking spawn, there's another person here to kill me.
[07:01.04]This is walk out of spawn and get attacked in the game.
[07:04.54]Cough Pro.
[07:04.94]Almost like the enemies come back after you shoot them.
[07:07.78]Well, they're at the spawn.
[07:10.73]Like, every time I go around this corner, there's a person here.
[07:29.96]I would adore Jerma being taken by ambulance as a running joke.
[07:33.25]I think that person wants you to be injured.
[07:37.69]Over and over.
[07:38.17]I might not ever do it again.
[07:40.43]Still do it again.
[07:43.61]Maybe not.
[07:44.89]Who knows?
[07:45.15]Remember that funny joke I did back four years ago?
[07:49.03]We're doing it again.
[07:50.81]When have I ever said that?
[07:53.15]Constantly.
[07:55.26]I was never out of those words.
[07:57.30]You said it five minutes ago!
[08:00.95]What?
[08:02.03]Ashley doesn't like anyone.
[08:03.91]What do you mean?
[08:04.37]What are you talking about?
[08:05.25]You get in a group call with Ashley and she just wants to start shit.
[08:08.09]I don't start shit, I finish it.
[08:10.77]Alright, well it's over.
[08:15.45]Just like Beyonce, my mentor.
[08:20.72]Shit.
[08:21.56]I'll just kneel down here for a while.
[08:28.24]Secretly count Chocula?
[08:30.12]Could be.
[08:38.31]Oh my god, all these strange knives.
[08:40.23]Shit.
[08:42.05]I forgot I had all the strange knives.
[08:46.56]That just, like, scared me.
[08:48.52]Yeah, I did another, uh, Victor of Ranner.
[08:51.14]No Demon's Souls.
[08:53.68]That's so weird.
[08:58.47]Didn't we do it the one time with all those hexes on them?
[09:01.49]That's when the Demon's Souls popped up?
[09:04.31]Maybe.
[09:04.87]That does increase drops.
[09:07.81]That's probably it.
[09:09.95]Jerma, what's your opinion on, um... On what?
[09:18.38]Molasses.
[09:20.10]On... On... Coffee... On cheese crumb cake.
[09:28.31]What about it?
[09:29.31]Edamame cheese crumb cake.
[09:30.43]What's your opinion?
[09:31.29]That's actually pretty good.
[09:33.75]Ashley, can you get me some of that?
[09:36.37]Did they make it for you once?
[09:38.55]Oh.
[09:40.41]Why do I have a memory of making it for you?
[09:42.05]I don't know.
[09:44.54]I think it's Entamins, not Edamins, isn't it?
[09:46.38]I don't know.
[09:48.48]I just eat it.
[09:48.84]Why did someone come over here?
[09:49.74]What the hell?
[09:50.18]I swear I did it.
[09:51.86]Ah!
[10:04.74]I have, like, memories of making a crumb cake, and who else would I make a crumb cake for?
[10:08.56]Oh, shit.
[10:09.90]Oh, I didn't have anything loaded in!
[10:11.12]Damn it!
[10:11.52]What the hell?
[10:13.10]Well, I think you might have made a crumb cake, but not a cheese crumb cake.
[10:17.02]That's why I always, I wish I had auto-reload on, but it distracts me.
[10:22.36]It always distracts the hell out of me.
[10:27.90]I agree.
[10:29.68]Do you use auto-reload?
[10:31.20]No.
[10:32.28]And if I do, I turn View Models off.
[10:34.08]Didn't you used to, a long time ago?
[10:35.64]Oh yeah, and I turn View Models off.
[10:45.85]You plan on being Pac-Man for Halloween again?
[10:47.91]Shit.
[10:49.67]Dude, I... That post where all I did was whine.
[11:00.28]Halloween this year, I don't even know.
[11:03.28]Dude, I really want to have a Halloween video, but... Are you going to make that Halloween video you were planning on doing?
[11:09.35]I don't know.
[11:09.71]Potentially, maybe.
[11:10.71]I'm planning on doing.
[11:11.75]The next couple of days, I'm going to have to look into if that's even remotely interesting.
[11:20.58]But that has been the plan I've had for the last year.
[11:23.42]Oh, fuck it.
[11:24.52]Someone else will kill him.
[11:25.84]So...
[11:30.34]You know when you just, when there's a game, and you mean to play it, and you don't get around to it, and it turns out Rake is bad?
[11:41.48]I've made plenty of videos where I go, I don't like, that wasn't good, I don't want that.
[11:46.12]Well, no, I mean, like, when you're gonna play, like, you have a game, you know you're gonna play the game, and like, oh, yeah, I could probably make a video on that, and then you finally actually play it, and it's just, it's just awful.
[11:56.95]Like, Rake.
[11:57.95]Like, I waited three or four months to play Rake, and it just wasn't into it.
[12:06.62]Maybe I should just play it from the start.
[12:13.23]How long did you play Rake for?
[12:17.27]Maybe an hour and a half.
[12:18.76]I mean, you can kind of tell what the whole game is pretty easily.
[12:21.88]I'm a medic.
[12:27.20]I feel like I can't even get out of the fucking area here.
[12:32.67]Are we seriously just locked in?
[12:36.85]What the fuck?
[12:48.28]I'm ready to get him.
[12:48.86]There's a soldier just standing over here.
[12:51.80]Hey, man.
[12:54.44]How you doing?
[13:03.24]Steve, did you get my message?
[13:06.32]No, I can't pause the game and I'm in spider world again.
[13:09.97]I don't know why I'm doing this again.
[13:11.17]I need to find somebody to give this to.
[13:12.37]Well, I need an invite because my internet dropped for a second.
[13:17.35]Whenever you're ready.
[13:20.18]Do we have... Oh, boy.
[13:23.86]We don't have any classes I can really give this to.
[13:26.98]Well, okay.
[13:27.78]Looks like I can give it to this pyro.
[13:30.24]Jeremy, you should bring back scared Saturdays, man.
[13:34.48]That was hilarious because you would get genuinely scared.
[13:37.05]Ha ha.
[13:38.93]Scary Saturdays.
[13:40.92]Scare Saturdays.
[13:42.62]Dude, seriously though, playing Rake today, I fucking flipped out.
[13:45.40]I think you might have heard me scream.
[13:46.98]It was a genuine, like, seriously, are you fucking kidding me scream.
[13:50.98]The jump scare, dude.
[13:52.36]I'm kind of used to your screams now.
[13:53.96]I know, I didn't expect Rake to be like a spooky game.
[13:56.16]I thought it was a goofy, haha, look at this.
[13:59.92]It wasn't goofy, it was scary, dude.
[14:02.74]I can just, like, go about my day and not notice you screaming.
[14:05.56]That's how common it is.
[14:06.86]Get on the point!
[14:11.25]He doesn't need to see me.
[14:12.57]Somebody get over here.
[14:14.25]Somebody get on the point with me!
[14:15.29]Yes!
[14:16.59]Nice job.
[14:21.39]I'm not, like, smashed.
[14:22.27]I'm not like those other streamers.
[14:24.25]I don't scream.
[14:27.68]Dude, I used to like roller coasters because they were the only place, like, in public where you could legit scream and you wouldn't be judged.
[14:36.68]Concerts?
[14:38.84]Yeah, you can scream at concerts.
[14:41.10]What?
[14:42.76]Go watch Biebs.
[14:44.04]I'm just shaking so violently right now.
[14:47.65]I would listen at concerts because I was polite.
[14:52.31]Who the hell is Ashley?
[14:54.43]Who the hell is that?
[14:57.77]Nice.
[15:00.73]Who the heck?
[15:03.73]Star screams like three times a stream.
[15:08.94]You know, I actually have noticed something about you.
[15:10.74]You do a lot of screaming.
[15:12.80]I do.
[15:13.38]You do scream, don't you?
[15:14.92]I've become a screamer.
[15:20.65]Sometimes I can't hold it back, you know?
[15:22.45]I used to worry about our neighbors, but not anymore.
[15:31.49]Because he's like louder.
[15:35.55]Oh, I saved your life!
[15:37.17]No!
[15:38.13]No!
[15:38.99]What the... No, no, no, no, no.
[15:43.94]Get too many medics.
[15:48.92]It could be engineer guy.
[15:50.64]I'll be soldier man.
[15:55.20]With my dirty ass hamburger gun.
[16:00.32]I think I'm using the battle-scarred one on purpose.
[16:03.80]It's Pratt, the spy, I would have to assume.
[16:17.33]I agree.
[16:22.07]This is Halloween, this is Halloween.
[16:27.21]Where did that guy even come from?
[16:33.52]You came from Halloween.
[16:46.83]Shit.
[16:56.19]Do I not enjoy scare Saturdays?
[16:59.05]I mean, it's just one of those things that I did it for a while.
[17:02.81]I played all the scary kind of games that were around at the time.
[17:07.65]And I did it.
[17:09.91]It was interesting.
[17:10.59]It was fun for me when I did it.
[17:13.25]Now it's all played out.
[17:15.03]Just like Duncan Maddox.
[17:16.67]I don't know why I went up here.
[17:23.04]Rocket jump!
[17:24.08]Oh yeah!
[17:29.76]Huge sentry.
[17:36.41]Though one day Jerm is going to record a game that I've been asking him to make a video on for like six months.
[17:43.85]At least.
[17:44.25]Maybe even a year at this point.
[17:45.45]Who knows?
[17:45.95]Maybe.
[17:46.27]There's potential.
[17:49.33]I doubt it.
[17:53.11]There is potential there.
[17:56.39]Could figure out maybe a Halloween video.
[17:58.78]Maybe that could be it.
[18:00.42]Whoa, boy.
[18:02.42]We're in that thing there.
[18:22.03]Do, do, do, do, do, do.
[18:29.77]Damn it.
[18:43.96]Damn it!
[18:46.74]Yeah!
[18:51.84]He's gonna be surprised when he sees a Heavy!
[18:53.38]Awww...
[19:02.27]Oh boy!
[19:06.45]We got a screamer.
[19:07.17]That would have been great.
[19:12.04]That would have been good.
[19:12.88]If I did it like a half second earlier.
[19:20.70]Am I gonna play that new game that Star keeps talking about?
[19:22.80]I don't think it's necessarily a new game.
[19:31.21]It's actually probably quite old at this point.
[19:39.65]You're gonna check it out.
[19:45.81]When am I going to check it out?
[19:47.05]Oh, you just crit the fuck out of me.
[20:05.56]Oh yeah, I do have that.
[20:06.30]I think I just put this on really quickly.
[20:08.39]I forgot I even should have that on.
[20:17.89]I don't know, I'm not sure if I'm a fan of this map.
[20:21.81]A lot of people, I don't mind it.
[20:23.94]A lot of people didn't seem to like it.
[20:29.18]No, truck truck is not a fan.
[20:31.06]I just bounced that off my fucking own face.
[20:42.81]It's not that I dislike it, it just feels very cluttered and people can, like, come from every direction.
[20:49.86]They really can't, though.
[20:51.42]They can.
[20:52.56]God, this guy with the mini Crit Eviction Notice is fucking me up, big time.
[20:58.95]Sprinting around like crazy.
[21:11.71]After this round, I'm gonna switch to the other map.
[21:17.45]Wow, look at Jerma picking favorites.
[21:23.03]You know who doesn't pick favorites?
[21:24.71]Mothers.
[21:27.73]What?
[21:31.52]What?
[21:35.18]Lost in the chicken noises.
[21:43.20]Get out of here with that.
[21:57.73]That mini.
[22:04.09]Did I just get crit from across the map with that thing?
[22:10.78]Shoot!
[22:12.59]Is the invasion update the Halloween update?
[22:15.76]No.
[22:15.92]I don't think it's supposed to be, but... It's not.
[22:18.76]It's... I don't know.
[22:20.78]They're adding Halloween items, right?
[22:22.66]At some point here?
[22:24.36]Yeah.
[22:25.66]Halloween update's another community update.
[22:27.39]That guy went so high.
[22:34.69]How high did he go?
[22:39.01]Really high.
[22:43.52]He charged right when I charged.
[22:45.49]And I missed with that, too.
[22:47.21]I'm gonna fucking pee my pants.
[22:53.83]You always say that.
[22:54.87]I know, I do.
[22:56.31]Yeah, you always do.
[22:58.65]I've seen your pants before.
[22:59.79]Oh, I went for the greedy other key.
[23:02.01]I got it.
[23:02.35]It's okay.
[23:02.67]We're cool.
[23:04.17]Hello?
[23:05.22]Hello.
[23:05.40]You invite me to your game?
[23:08.66]No.
[23:09.60]No?
[23:10.62]I'm almost done with it, then I'm done playing.
[23:12.32]I'm gonna wrap around and do it.
[23:13.70]I always say that.
[23:14.86]And then I catch you playing it later.
[23:17.22]There's people shooting me.
[23:18.70]You're becoming very untrustworthy.
[23:20.24]Whoa!
[23:20.82]Warning you.
[23:22.16]No, what if I... Does anybody... That was really weird.
[23:25.63]I, like, teleported to the right somehow.
[23:31.85]I'm done with Cryptarch.
[23:32.99]It was a dumb game.
[23:33.77]It was a teleportation.
[23:35.87]An hour later.
[23:37.21]Ster in steam, play Cryptarch.
[23:38.87]What have they done?
[23:53.72]You're still on her, Sam.
[23:54.62]Nope.
[23:55.90]Alright, that's not what I'm gonna do.
[23:57.78]Doesn't look like being a gamer good.
[24:06.05]The worst part about this, so, living here, there's no bathroom down where I am, so if I have to go, if I have to really pee real bad, I have to go all the way up, like, the stairs.
[24:15.45]Oh, no!
[24:15.83]I know!
[24:16.95]No, my god!
[24:18.00]He's gotta go up stairs!
[24:18.58]I mean, you already did something today.
[24:23.23]I'm going to an observer.
[24:25.79]This probed map.
[24:28.29]I am not a fan.
[24:30.13]I'm not a hater of this map, but I'm not really a fan of it either.
[24:33.23]Why don't you just walk out the door like Adonis?
[24:36.68]I'll tell.
[24:41.40]You gotta pee on top of his pee so that he knows that you're boss.
[24:49.60]Let's go to...
[24:53.19]I read that if you pee on top of pee, it's twice the amount of pee.
[25:00.00]Why did you read that?
[25:03.58]I really didn't even hear what you said.
[25:05.12]What did you say?
[25:05.74]If you pee on top of pee?
[25:07.71]It wasn't important.
[25:09.13]It really wasn't.
[25:10.95]You know how sometimes I just talk?
[25:13.37]I do, yeah.
[25:14.03]You do that sometimes.
[25:16.93]You know how sometimes I don't listen to anything that you're saying?
[25:19.90]Oh yeah, that happens quite often as well.
[25:24.91]Alright, give me a haiku, quick, about the invasion update.
[25:33.62]I would have to count my hands when I don't have a hand free.
[25:35.74]You don't have a hand free?
[25:38.06]Yeah, how many?
[25:38.60]It's 575?
[25:38.74]Yeah, it's 575 or 757.
[25:39.22]I think it's 575.
[25:39.76]That's definitely 575.
[25:41.67]Yes, it is.
[25:42.13]Wow, I'm back in middle school right now.
[25:52.37]The most popular poem structure in the world.
[25:54.99]How does it feel to be a haiku haiku?
[25:57.93]Let's go on the beam together guys.
[26:01.39]I actually don't even know how this like works.
[26:04.41]How does this like actually work?
[26:05.41]We only played this for a few minutes.
[26:10.02]That's the beer bottle thing.
[26:13.04]What's going on right here?
[26:14.54]Like nobody's fighting.
[26:15.56]Everyone just like glitching into the beam.
[26:20.44]Dude, I think the Demon's Souls are from doing the... the con- the treasure things.
[26:30.97]Get those beer bottles.
[26:36.29]Can you get more?
[26:37.59]No.
[26:38.83]Get away from me.
[26:41.44]Now that he's still alive.
[26:42.86]You'd have to do the challenges, I think.
[26:45.76]I see.
[26:46.68]There he is.
[26:48.22]There he is.
[26:49.24]Don't let him get away.
[26:54.08]I get six beer bottles.
[26:56.26]That means I can heal people.
[26:59.04]Cool.
[27:04.83]Oh, come back here, dude.
[27:06.49]Come back here.
[27:06.86]I got you.
[27:07.68]I could have got you.
[27:09.16]We don't want to lose you a fork.
[27:21.42]Alright, where's that soldier?
[27:22.98]He fell.
[27:24.09]Everyone's fallen.
[27:25.63]I'm just gonna deposit my beer bottles.
[27:27.43]Hopefully I can do this without dying.
[27:31.13]Okay.
[27:34.33]Anybody, anybody, anybody?
[27:35.38]I can do this too.
[27:37.56]I'm fine.
[27:41.94]You know what, Scout?
[27:42.80]You know what?
[27:44.08]Let's go for it.
[27:49.01]Get that soldier.
[27:52.73]I... Ow.
[27:53.27]You didn't hit that?
[27:54.80]That's how much health he had?
[27:58.54]I got switched.
[28:04.42]That was the funniest thing you've said so far.
[28:07.18]You have to one-up that fart noise.
[28:11.53]That was the best thing you've done.
[28:14.31]I think your whole YouTube career, that was it.
[28:20.55]Well...
[28:23.72]Only downhill from here.
[28:26.60]Well... Can't really... He had so many beer bottles too.
[28:32.64]How many does this guy have?
[28:50.11]Can't really go anywhere.
[28:59.42]Give me the heal!
[29:12.86]Ah!
[29:14.04]Get me up there!
[29:18.20]Give me all your bottles, how many do you have?
[29:20.21]Quite a few, but I can't do anything now.
[29:27.24]Stop sneaking up on me!
[29:28.36]Where'd he go?
[29:52.95]I was trying to go for some cheeky little shit there.
[30:01.98]So that's text-to-speech?
[30:06.80]I thought that was some guy just going, we are in the beam.
[30:09.78]That's a text-to-speech program?
[30:11.00]I don't know.
[30:14.72]Sounds like something the chat would accuse it of.
[30:18.46]That's not the first time I've heard it either.
[30:20.86]Somebody else was saying that too.
[30:21.90]I think Valve has enough resources to hire a guy to say.
[30:28.41]Valve didn't make it.
[30:31.60]They outsource.
[30:36.99]The belt didn't make it.
[30:47.34]Guy with 11.
[30:47.76]I'm going to go for that guy.
[31:03.33]Where are you?
[31:03.93]Where are you?
[31:14.67]Wow, that guy's got 19.
[31:15.47]Shit, and that guy knows I don't have any health.
[31:25.44]I don't even have... I just have, like, random dumb hats on the sniper.
[31:37.16]20.
[31:37.32]Deposit those 20!
[31:40.81]Make our lead stronger.
[31:52.00]God, every time I've aimed in I've been hit with a fucking... I'm gonna put the camper on.
[32:06.46]I'll give you 14 refined for that sniper.
[32:12.42]Give me what?
[32:21.97]They're everywhere.
[32:24.65]Some refined.
[32:26.33]This guy is still here.
[32:29.03]Oh my god.
[32:30.01]I'll do a trade.
[32:31.89]That guy was just standing there waiting for me to come out.
[32:34.25]I could have got the health.
[32:35.27]What the fuck am I doing?
[32:37.43]Let's do a trade.
[32:41.54]Trade for the sniper.
[32:42.68]Are you trying to seduce somebody?
[32:44.62]What do you want to trade?
[32:45.44]I'll trade you 14 refined for the sniper.
[32:50.46]Not worth it.
[32:50.90]I give you a key.
[32:52.76]Can't trade for that gate.
[32:54.08]I give you a key, General.
[32:56.15]Ow.
[33:01.09]I don't think that guy's watching the stream.
[33:05.09]I really don't think he is.
[33:06.43]I don't think so.
[33:16.52]Wow, Jeremy, you should have the HUD that takes away the people.
[33:19.78]Oh, that's right.
[33:20.58]You have that cool, funny little HUD.
[33:23.39]Yeah, I do.
[33:24.27]And you have never used a custom HUD in your life.
[33:26.65]Yes, I have.
[33:29.45]That was fun for a day.
[33:30.73]I used the Garmin HUD.
[33:35.09]I don't know how that's missing.
[33:36.43]I really don't.
[33:38.17]And I get fucking crit to shit.
[33:39.94]Alright.
[33:47.88]It's time to go... I'm gonna go Pyro.
[33:51.89]Flare gun man.
[34:10.05]No, that was way off.
[34:14.03]Oh my god, fucking damn it.
[34:36.29]I really like this.
[34:37.88]What's it called?
[34:38.34]The Nostromo or something?
[34:39.48]Genuine Nostro?
[34:40.48]What's it called?
[34:41.62]Genuine Nostromo and Napalmer.
[34:43.28]I like how this thing looks.
[34:45.22]Nostradamus?
[34:46.44]Yeah, Nostradamus' flamethrower.
[34:52.60]I traded him to Keefer.
[34:54.92]There's a sentry in there.
[35:01.33]That's good to know.
[35:11.84]Does that say respawning in 50 seconds?
[35:16.14]Okay.
[35:17.30]That's why.
[35:18.32]If you trade me, I'll let you respawn.
[35:21.36]50 second respawn?
[35:30.04]I'll try.
[35:30.38]I'll do that.
[35:32.68]I'm running around as a scout guy.
[35:33.72]I'm going to take this off, though.
[35:34.73]I'm going to put the ham sandwich on.
[35:37.61]I just want to say real quickly that Demigod is still being sold for $10.
[35:42.30]Is it on Steam?
[35:45.40]Yeah.
[35:47.68]That game that can't be played.
[35:49.14]It can't be played?
[35:51.78]You can't play Demigod?
[35:54.19]I tried once and I opened the game and it was like, oh, those servers are down because this game is old.
[36:00.01]Are you serious?
[36:02.33]Yeah.
[36:04.25]So there's something wrong about that, or like they've added servers again.
[36:10.22]That's strange.
[36:12.46]Not as strange as that scattergun.
[36:16.86]You can't have it, okay?
[36:19.05]You can't have this.
[36:19.95]Why do you have all the purple glowers?
[36:22.55]Yeah, because purple, man.
[36:24.67]It's my favorite color.
[36:33.37]What level is it?
[36:34.65]Let's take a look.
[36:39.91]Field tested.
[36:41.27]Do I have any other ones that are... I have a factory new.
[36:45.28]This one's... I don't like this one, though.
[36:47.10]This one, you can't even really tell you're wearing it.
[36:49.64]Like, look, ready?
[36:50.18]It's like, when you're running around... I'll put the factory new on.
[36:55.26]Factory new, where is it?
[36:59.44]Like, it's hard to even know that this is a different scattergun.
[37:04.50]You have to really, especially like world model too, like you have to like really like, what is, is there a design on that?
[37:09.59]Night terror, that's what I'm, that's what I'm all about.
[37:13.23]You can't even really tell that there's a, except if you're like at the right light, you can see it.
[37:17.72]Well, you have to press the inspect key all the time.
[37:19.68]Like as you watch me run around, like it's hard to even determine if I'm wearing anything.
[37:24.42]Alright, fine.
[37:25.34]Okay.
[37:25.86]You want to do that?
[37:27.08]Is that what you want to do?
[37:28.63]Jeremiah, please wear some clothes.
[37:33.33]105.
[37:33.35]What do you got?
[37:34.91]Let's see it.
[37:36.61]I got 10.
[37:37.79]Let's see it.
[37:38.25]I want to see how much damage you do.
[37:43.28]Alright, go beyond your merry way.
[37:46.84]That wasn't even... That wasn't as much damage as I did.
[37:48.64]I only hit you once, too.
[37:57.36]I only hit you once.
[37:58.34]You hit me more than once.
[37:59.16]I just want to see what you had.
[38:00.06]I want to see what you got.
[38:05.20]Alright, that's how it's gonna be.
[38:06.38]I guess that's the way it is.
[38:11.32]Get away from me Pyro.
[38:25.05]Dude, that looks like you're streaming Team Fortress 2 to me.
[38:28.45]I am streaming Team Fortress 2 to you.
[38:30.70]And a bunch of other people that are watching.
[38:34.00]Yeah.
[38:39.34]I crit you, I'm sorry.
[38:44.66]Someone says in chat, kill that dumbass, please, Jerma, and he's referring to me, I'm sure.
[38:50.06]You'd go to jail.
[38:54.03]I'm, like, jumping off the scuff.
[38:55.49]I just, like, jumped into his sword.
[38:57.75]Pretty sure killing dumbass is illegal.
[39:01.66]If you go to court, then the judge just says, oh, yeah, it was a dumbass, wasn't it?
[39:05.91]No, if you can prove that they were a dumbass, you can get away with it.
[39:08.89]I get so upset whenever I see a heavy crouch with melee, it's like I'm conditioned to become angry as soon as it happens.
[39:23.06]Whoa, whoa, there's a soda there.
[39:24.11]Did I just call it a soda?
[39:27.71]Yeah.
[39:28.01]You did.
[39:29.89]Actually, truck truck always calls them sody pops.
[39:36.76]How have you not died?
[39:38.12]It's a hit point system that the game uses.
[39:45.38]Get in it!
[39:46.48]Come on, come on!
[39:47.66]Oh, he's getting... Stay in the beam!
[39:53.50]Hooray!
[39:54.92]Dullmasses are an important resource and are protected.
[39:58.00]Aw.
[40:00.12]So they're like migratory birds.
[40:04.40]I can't see underwater!
[40:07.93]Sharma, how does it feel to be a migratory bird?
[40:09.97]I don't know.
[40:13.07]Good one.
[40:13.61]Fuck, I just misclicked.
[40:18.08]We are in the stream.
[40:19.18]I just... I just hit the... Hit that guy with, like, every other pellet from the gun.
[40:32.37]Unfortunately.
[40:41.54]There's a visual novel on Steam about someone becoming a Starcraft 2 pro.
[40:47.25]That seems like the weirdest... How come you're not gonna buy it?
[40:51.85]I'm tempted!
[40:52.57]Oh, it's free!
[40:53.21]It's free?
[40:53.83]Probably because I couldn't license it.
[40:56.25]I can see it.
[40:58.28]And it's recommended by the curator.
[41:00.26]Total disclaimer.
[41:00.70]It says it's great.
[41:02.80]Curator?
[41:06.40]Yeah, I bet I could learn so much about StarCraft II from this visual novel.
[41:12.70]That's- that's so odd.
[41:17.95]What did he do?
[41:18.61]How did he curate something?
[41:20.37]Wow, he just fucking knocked me down.
[41:22.17]A curator suspends.
[41:27.63]Oh!
[41:27.69]Case!
[41:32.07]Where- how- I still haven't seen...
[41:36.14]a invasion crate.
[41:39.39]Was that just a gun?
[41:40.17]Wait a minute.
[41:40.73]Hold on.
[41:41.17]Was that a gun metal case?
[41:43.47]Yes, it was.
[41:45.23]I actually haven't... Well, I haven't played in a couple days, but I haven't obviously gotten the invasion case drop.
[41:52.97]Well, that seems a little strange.
[41:54.85]They're dropping the gun metal cases?
[41:57.31]Still?
[42:00.43]You think that kind of drop would be replaced?
[42:02.46]I think so.
[42:10.72]You're not dead.
[42:17.16]Give me those beards!
[42:18.46]Oh, he got them.
[42:19.26]Holy shit, you have so many.
[42:22.85]Oh my god, if I could fucking hit you.
[42:25.39]Go with the ham.
[42:26.13]Once, when you can't fucking hit shit, just bring out the ham.
[42:28.33]That's like, very, very important.
[42:30.37]Strategy.
[42:40.71]Told you.
[42:59.05]That bloody loot crate box.
[43:01.73]Like a door cube, that's what it was.
[43:03.83]The door cube.
[43:04.99]Be careful, Sniper!
[43:05.85]Hold it.
[43:06.71]Is it Pyre?
[43:07.31]Not Pyre, really.
[43:08.37]Spy.
[43:16.07]Yah!
[43:18.33]Yah!
[43:22.22]Ow.
[43:26.28]The invasion crates have a stupidly, ridiculously low drop rate.
[43:31.28]They're not more expensive after the event is over.
[43:33.39]They're less expensive.
[43:34.65]What's going on?
[43:35.09]That guy had a Boston Bash just sticking out of his forearm.
[43:38.49]That doesn't compute- Yeah, that's a fun new glitch.
[43:41.27]This bug.
[43:49.77]Quiet game commentary with hints of conversation night.
[43:53.87]Hints of conversation.
[43:55.43]With small hints.
[43:58.58]Jerma can't hold a conversation while he plays a game.
[44:00.94]I can't.
[44:02.66]If I'm focusing on a video game, I cannot talk.
[44:05.90]Otherwise, I'll just go like this.
[44:08.38]The amount of times you've told me, like, oh, Michael, why aren't you talking?
[44:11.32]I usually, like, conversate in your stream.
[44:14.58]Same reason, right?
[44:18.10]No, like, you've asked me to, like, start up conversations before while you're streaming, and if I, like, ask you questions or try and talk to you, I never get a response.
[44:26.48]You're just, like, not there.
[44:27.50]I'm here.
[44:28.40]What's up?
[44:29.82]I'm here.
[44:30.10]Hey.
[44:31.18]What do you want to know?
[44:32.96]Nothing right now.
[44:34.45]Well, come on.
[44:35.07]What do you want to know?
[44:36.55]Otto.
[44:37.03]Otto's right behind me.
[44:38.47]He's sleeping.
[44:41.52]I guess I could tell the story of how I took him out today.
[44:44.36]Tell us.
[44:46.38]So I took Otto out today.
[44:48.77]And we were doing the, you go to the bathroom, dog.
[44:52.43]Go outside and pee and poo.
[44:54.31]We all know what that's like.
[44:56.05]The bathroom dog.
[44:57.47]So I take bathroom dog out.
[45:00.37]And we're doing fine.
[45:02.20]He pees, he poos.
[45:04.08]And I notice that there's some sticky things all over his feet.
[45:07.44]We were walking around in the wooded area.
[45:10.50]We were like in a wooded path.
[45:12.76]So he ends up getting these, he must have stepped in like sap or something, like tree sap, I have no idea what the hell he could have stepped in.
[45:19.65]He was climbing the trees, yes.
[45:23.57]And he, oh shit, hold on.
[45:27.23]I gotta pay attention, I'm getting critical prigged.
[45:32.41]Doesn't that count, Mingler?
[45:33.43]I didn't get critical prigged.
[45:34.62]Alright, I was kidding.
[45:36.71]So he ended up having these flippers of leaves all over him.
[45:41.56]It was as if he was gonna go scuba diving.
[45:44.52]He had leaf scuba flippers for every single foot.
[45:47.76]And he was just like walking really awkwardly.
[45:50.78]And I was like, what the hell is this dog doing?
[45:53.56]And finally I looked at his hands and the ground was coming up with him.
[45:59.26]So I spent at least 20 to 30 minutes cleaning this dog's hands and feet.
[46:04.72]Hands and feet.
[46:05.82]Are you sure that was your dog, Jorma?
[46:09.76]That guy just died.
[46:10.56]This might have been like a homeless man you found in a leaf pile.
[46:15.39]Yeah, I confused a homeless man with a dog.
[46:17.67]You spent 30 minutes cleaning him and there was a homeless man under it instead of your dog.
[46:22.21]I don't think that's what happened.
[46:25.48]Dog hands.
[46:27.84]It was very odd.
[46:33.70]And it's not the first time that's happened before.
[46:37.84]That's happened to this dog, like, at least one or two times before.
[46:41.84]I think your dog is part gecko.
[46:43.84]I don't know, he's got really sticky hands.
[46:46.66]Sticky feet.
[46:47.78]I mean hands, sorry.
[46:49.18]Well, both.
[46:54.72]If you could give your dog one superpower, what would it be?
[47:01.15]Ah!
[47:02.52]It would poop money, obviously.
[47:04.58]One superpower?
[47:07.78]That's actually a really, really tough question.
[47:09.95]Because one could be like poop gold.
[47:12.53]No, it wouldn't poop at all.
[47:14.13]There you go.
[47:15.11]No, we're rephrasing the question.
[47:18.04]Your superpower also has to be a power that, like, someone from the X-Men or, like, a real superhero has.
[47:23.63]You can't change their poop.
[47:25.03]No one has.
[47:25.51]Wait, what?
[47:26.29]Hold on.
[47:27.19]The dog needs to have a superpower, and it needs to be, like, a real superpower, not a poop-changing power.
[47:33.10]Okay, Professor X has weird poops, okay?
[47:37.50]Oh.
[47:38.18]Professor X has normal poops.
[47:39.98]He's just a paraplegic, and you're making fun of handicapped people.
[47:43.14]What?
[47:43.46]What?
[47:45.34]Professor X is like the most intelligent telepathic mind ever.
[47:50.06]Yeah.
[47:51.10]I would just be like Otto.
[47:52.72]Can he understand English?
[47:53.94]Does he have these powers?
[47:55.82]But I can't ask him to do anything.
[47:59.10]Whatever power it is, you have to pick which power you want him to have.
[48:02.71]Why is this popular?
[48:03.93]1,000 viewers?
[48:04.35]Team Fortress 2?
[48:05.35]Oh my goodness.
[48:09.67]Why is this popular?
[48:13.85]I mean, if he had Professor Xavier's power, he still wouldn't be able to talk, because his power isn't to talk.
[48:19.71]His power is connecting minds with other people.
[48:22.61]So, like, maybe Otto could, like, be in your head.
[48:24.99]Then I would have the beast power, because then the dog could talk, and it'd still be a beast.
[48:31.15]You know what?
[48:31.53]I don't know.
[48:33.12]I'd probably give him, like...
[48:36.42]Is there a character that can... Beast is a good choice, because he's extremely, like, smart, and he can, like, move around, and he's... Would the dog be as big as Beast?
[48:46.82]Does the dog... Yeah, he would slowly start turning, like, blue and growing.
[48:50.44]Would he be, like, huge?
[48:52.55]He wouldn't be huge, but he'd start mutating, I guess.
[48:56.27]Or he could have, like, a nightcrawler dog.
[49:01.17]He could let himself outside.
[49:03.99]Whatever.
[49:05.14]No, he'd just keep teleporting after everything and then he'd be halfway across the country.
[49:08.82]Fantastic Four?
[49:09.44]What the fuck is- how many blue people are on this other team?
[49:12.81]Fantastic Four stretchy guy?
[49:14.23]I want a stretchy dog.
[49:15.71]No.
[49:18.37]There was just seven people there with no other red people on this team.
[49:21.89]I put my foot down on stretchy dog.
[49:24.35]I want a stretchy dog.
[49:25.39]Either that or the flame on guy.
[49:26.89]It would just stretch its butt into bed and poop in the bed.
[49:30.40]The human flame.
[49:31.20]Get his name right, you fucking idiot.
[49:33.32]Oh my god.
[49:34.58]What's the name of the guy who stretches?
[49:36.36]Dr. Doom?
[49:37.68]No, not Dr. Doom.
[49:39.32]Mr. Fantastic!
[49:40.74]That's his name.
[49:41.50]It's a stupid name, and he has a stupid power, and he's a stupid character.
[49:44.88]It's the human torch, not the human flame.
[49:49.01]Human flame.
[49:50.31]Yeah, you fucking idiot.
[49:51.89]You fucking idiot.
[49:52.69]The Thing.
[49:55.29]Bobberin' time.
[49:56.43]I hate the Fantastic Four.
[49:57.49]They're the worst superheroes ever.
[49:59.51]What?
[50:00.03]Why?
[50:00.29]Besides Dr. Doom.
[50:02.29]What am I stuck on?
[50:03.05]What the fuck is happening with my life?
[50:04.45]I mean, why?
[50:05.47]The Thing?
[50:08.30]His name is The Thing, Gerbil.
[50:09.78]He's covered with rocks.
[50:11.84]I don't even know what just happened.
[50:15.62]Gummy Boy.
[50:16.34]And Gummy Boy.
[50:21.72]Gumby!
[50:23.42]Give me those!
[50:24.24]Give me those!
[50:25.32]Gumby is cool, of course.
[50:27.02]But he's not an X-Man, so he doesn't count.
[50:29.38]Alright, you could be an X-Man.
[50:30.10]Gumby should be an armored dog.
[50:31.90]If I could be an X-Man?
[50:33.28]Yeah.
[50:38.10]Toad.
[50:39.32]I think if I wanted to be, like, in all the movies, I'd be Wolverine.
[50:43.73]I don't want you.
[50:46.37]You wanted to be... You wanted to have the best, like, exclusivity deals.
[50:49.53]I feel like no matter how good your power is, like, the less screen time you're getting.
[50:53.05]Because that guy who could, like, run really fast and slow time pretty much, like, he was cut out because he made everything too easy.
[51:01.08]But, like, Wolverine is there.
[51:02.56]He's kind of, like, a really attractive man.
[51:05.00]Really vascular dude.
[51:06.56]Very vascular.
[51:07.56]His power was too good.
[51:11.10]I'd be into that.
[51:11.78]I mean, you could live for a really long time.
[51:13.64]Can't Jean Grey, like, end the planet if she really wanted to?
[51:17.48]Yeah, that's why she dies.
[51:19.20]That's why everyone tries to kill her.
[51:21.26]You want everyone to try to kill you?
[51:23.02]Yeah, but she can't control it, because she can't.
[51:25.82]You don't want to be Jean Grey.
[51:27.64]What the fuck, really?
[51:29.50]Yeah, and people get mad at you for using her in Marvel.
[51:34.88]They call you a scrub.
[51:35.66]Yeah, maybe like four years ago when anyone cared.
[51:39.93]Why do we have so many engineers?
[51:41.13]How come every time I go to a class it turns into like four of them?
[51:44.13]That's where you go.
[51:46.61]I'd like to spy.
[51:47.29]I'm gonna be a tri-spy.
[51:51.11]Quicksilver was cut out because of copyright issues?
[51:54.32]Are you serious?
[51:55.12]Who owns- does somebody else own Quicksilver?
[51:57.74]It wasn't the Avenger movie, for some reason, instead of the X-Men movies.
[52:03.80]Which I find suspicious.
[52:05.16]That's weird.
[52:06.30]And Scarlet Witch, which is a terrible name.
[52:14.41]Jesus, what the hell was I thinking there?
[52:18.51]What the fuck was I doing?
[52:20.05]No, we're staying spy.
[52:21.93]That was just dumb.
[52:24.29]Isn't there actually supposed to be a new season of Heroes coming out?
[52:27.87]Heroes?
[52:28.37]Is it a spin-off?
[52:29.21]Or is it an actual?
[52:30.03]No, it's an actual Heroes.
[52:31.73]I think they killed some of the characters because actors aren't returning, but Heroes is getting a new season, which I really didn't think was ever going to happen.
[52:38.32]That show is so old.
[52:39.84]The show is so random.
[52:42.16]And red.
[52:43.19]There's no, like, continuity between anything.
[52:45.81]It's like, each season, it's like, oh, here's a different timeline.
[52:50.27]I hear that somebody made pancakes in it.
[52:52.91]That is the best scene in the whole show, and that makes me, like, I, like, love that episode.
[52:56.89]That scene is one of my favorite moments of television.
[52:59.71]That's why I mentioned it, because your voice did that little thing.
[53:05.78]Wow.
[53:06.20]That guy just went right by me.
[53:07.06]Anyone who hasn't seen Siler make pancakes for his son, he's just, like, missing out.
[53:14.02]Give me the water!
[53:16.50]The spy has the beer stuck on him.
[53:18.10]That's pretty funny.
[53:21.19]It's like stuck to his head.
[53:22.29]Oh, get away from me.
[53:26.63]I'm a sniper on this team.
[53:28.07]How dare you try to kill me.
[53:29.41]I need to hypothermic.
[53:30.59]Better call Saul.
[53:32.39]I want it.
[53:32.77]I want it in my life.
[53:36.67]I wanna call Saul.
[53:37.79]Did that just fucking happen?
[53:41.09]The guy turned, and he wasn't even trying to hit me, and he crit me in the face, and I instantly died.
[53:45.35]Jerma, do you watch that show?
[53:46.67]Better Call Saul?
[53:47.31]Great show.
[53:47.65]Yeah.
[53:48.17]Yes.
[53:49.15]Yeah, yeah.
[53:50.39]I just, I hope, I hope, um... I wasn't really, like, a fan of how they ended that last episode.
[53:58.48]No, me neither.
[53:59.50]I called it, and you didn't believe me.
[54:01.16]I really didn't believe it, yeah.
[54:03.02]I've already forgiven them, but we don't need to... You okay?
[54:08.71]Maybe I haven't forgiven them.
[54:10.15]There are waffles on pancakes?
[54:11.73]Dude, Atara, that's a really late response.
[54:13.83]He probably, like, looked it up.
[54:17.20]I would have liked to have seen, like, more dragged out, kind of, like, why that happened to him, kind of thing.
[54:23.76]No one knows what you're talking about.
[54:28.73]You can't see me.
[54:31.15]You can't see me!
[54:33.19]Yeah, no spoilers.
[54:36.11]Spoilers?
[54:36.57]How would there be spoilers?
[54:37.73]That's what happens when I don't pay attention.
[54:41.14]If I'm gonna be, like, not paying attention... Trevor, when's the last moment you've paid attention?
[54:47.77]When I was just playing Spire right there, that last life, I was paying attention to everything people were saying.
[54:53.03]And I just walked around and just swung at Medic's faces.
[54:57.97]Truck Truck, can you come in the call and laugh?
[54:59.57]I don't think he has any of our sprites.
[55:04.59]Oh boy.
[55:05.97]You always take me seriously!
[55:09.29]I'm booting you.
[55:13.75]And he got me.
[55:17.94]I thought I had this on for some dumb reason.
[55:21.40]So your dog can understand language, that's what you wanted?
[55:23.62]And you're just screaming, oh, die.
[55:26.40]Does he understand that you're playing a game?
[55:27.90]Wouldn't he understand context?
[55:29.04]Would he understand context or what?
[55:31.14]I don't know, maybe he missed out on the context because he doesn't know what video games are.
[55:34.92]Like he hasn't learned that yet because he just became smart and now you're screaming die and he would like run away.
[55:40.10]God damn it.
[55:42.26]I was just talking about dogs with superpowers.
[55:48.14]That's a good question.
[55:49.72]Whenever you're in like, when you're a small infant child, the question is always like, oh, what superpower would you have?
[55:57.22]What superpower would your dog have?
[55:58.39]Because you have to consider, you're not in direct control of that.
[56:02.29]It's very important.
[56:03.01]I think that's a question that not enough people know their answer to.
[56:07.69]No.
[56:08.57]Good point.
[56:09.57]Yeah, if you can't answer these questions, like, who are you?
[56:12.25]What's the point?
[56:13.39]Why are you even around?
[56:14.71]Why don't you have a dog?
[56:16.81]Yeah, why don't you have a dog, dude?
[56:20.15]Get with it.
[56:25.35]How is the invasion update?
[56:26.83]You're watching it.
[56:28.99]My dog would be Crypto the dog, because he could both talk and he had all the powers of Superman.
[56:33.73]Shit.
[56:33.89]Which are, you could pretty much just pull out of your pocket and just pick one.
[56:37.83]Mine would be the super horse.
[56:39.51]That was also like the powers of Superman, but it was a horse, but it couldn't talk.
[56:42.62]It was just like a horse.
[56:45.62]Is that a real thing?
[56:46.80]Yes.
[56:47.40]Isn't that called a unicorn?
[56:51.18]No.
[56:52.62]It was like in love with a chick, too, and it's like, oh, if only I could tell her how I feel.
[56:56.58]It was like a horse.
[56:57.62]Are those the unicorns of this?
[56:58.96]Dude, that's some deep-level bestiality stuff.
[57:01.88]I know.
[57:03.80]Where'd he go?
[57:05.92]Comics, man.
[57:06.47]They're crazy.
[57:07.78]They are crazy.
[57:13.46]Wow!
[57:16.06]It didn't hit him.
[57:17.58]Frag check.
[57:20.70]That guy's got a fancy spell book on.
[57:24.55]Comet the Super Horse?
[57:25.67]Was that his name?
[57:26.63]That sounds right.
[57:27.41]That sounds really right.
[57:29.15]I don't know if I'd want my dog to have, like, Wolverine powers, because then wouldn't he, like...
[57:34.78]No, never mind.
[57:35.70]Wolverine's not immortal, right?
[57:38.40]He just can't, like, die, right?
[57:40.80]He, like, heals immediately, like, after, like, a day or something.
[57:43.04]He has a skeleton of adamantium Jerm.
[57:45.86]That isn't part of his power.
[57:47.84]Oh, I knew you were gonna say that!
[57:50.28]It's not part of his power?
[57:51.39]Look at that, because it was built into him, you're right.
[57:53.71]Yeah, I knew Jerm was gonna forget, that's why I explained it, because Jerm would be... Your dog would just have, like, long nails, which is...
[58:03.64]Sabretooth's power.
[58:05.64]Yeah.
[58:06.38]That's the worst power ever.
[58:08.48]I don't know how they tried to have him be cool and also fight Wolverine.
[58:12.62]Toad.
[58:13.82]I have long fingernails.
[58:15.55]Toad.
[58:16.85]Toad is cool.
[58:18.05]He is cool.
[58:19.79]It's because he's like the reject one.
[58:22.01]Yeah, but this Toad... Toad doesn't really do anything.
[58:25.15]He just kind of has a long tongue and jumps around.
[58:26.97]He can shoot mucus out of his throat.
[58:30.73]Think of all the things you can do with mucus in a long tongue.
[58:34.05]I know what you can do with a lot of mucus.
[58:35.31]You ever been real sick?
[58:37.27]It sucks.
[58:39.65]So what do you do with it?
[58:41.12]You just, like, nothing.
[58:42.28]What are you going to do with mucus?
[58:43.48]Spit it on people.
[58:44.36]That's what he does.
[58:45.28]That's disgusting.
[58:46.00]Spit it in people's faces.
[58:48.30]Didn't it, like, burn people?
[58:50.54]Oh, no.
[58:51.34]That's another, like, cliche.
[58:53.41]Like, burn people?
[58:56.27]Bad on Storm's face in the movie.
[58:57.96]It was real disgusting.
[58:59.56]And then she hit him with lightning.
[59:01.56]It's the worst line in any movie ever.
[59:03.16]Shit.
[59:05.90]Do you know what happens to a toad when it's struck by lightning?
[59:09.52]The same thing that happens to everything else.
[59:13.33]You gotta remember, the Wolverine does have his claws.
[59:18.45]Even without the metal, they were just made of bone instead.
[59:21.09]For no reason.
[59:26.49]Those bone claws are, like, dumb.
[59:28.72]Who was the other bone guy?
[59:30.82]Sabretooth.
[59:31.48]Yeah.
[59:32.00]Oh, okay.
[59:32.36]The bone, he had the extra long fingernails.
[59:34.14]That's what it's saying.
[59:39.23]Well, I want Darwin's power, so there.
[59:43.21]This is probably...
[59:44.64]He could like change his body into any shape he wanted.
[59:47.88]How did I not hit this guy?
[59:49.40]Like, are we fucking for real?
[59:51.46]He was on screen for like ten minutes and then he died.
[59:54.84]Did you just say change your body into a penis?
[59:57.29]That's what anyone would do.
[59:59.47]Not me.
[60:02.55]Wow.
[60:04.35]Okay, maybe I would if it was funny.
[60:06.81]It would be really funny.
[60:08.75]It would be really funny.
[60:10.83]At least once.
[60:13.50]My family wasn't there.
[60:14.60]This thing has just been a pain in the ass.
[60:19.38]I'd rather put that on.
[60:24.72]What's your favorite dog breed?
[60:27.62]What'd you say?
[60:28.08]That guy has almost 60.
[60:29.96]Dog breed?
[60:32.34]Yeah, what's your favorite dog breed?
[60:36.12]They all have good crawlies about them.
[60:39.00]They're all different.
[60:40.40]I love them.
[60:42.26]I think a husky is, like, the most attractive dog.
[60:44.58]Ouch, a crit.
[60:46.56]What'd you say?
[60:47.06]I agree.
[60:48.33]Husky is pretty nice looking, yeah.
[60:50.57]But they're, like, jerks.
[60:53.77]You wouldn't actually, like, want one.
[60:56.65]Wow, someone in the chat has a husky and is, like, upset that you said that.
[61:00.33]Hey, my friend had huskies growing up.
[61:03.20]They were jerks.
[61:04.54]Oh, so all huskies are jerks.
[61:06.94]Yeah, pretty much.
[61:08.98]I watched Animal Planet.
[61:11.87]What was your favorite show on Animal Planet?
[61:14.95]The show about dog breeds, obviously.
[61:19.16]Oh.
[61:19.74]Is there a sentry down here?
[61:20.54]There's probably a sentry down here, right?
[61:21.96]Has to be, right?
[61:22.80]I guess not.
[61:23.98]Know all the dog lore, okay?
[61:27.82]Huskies are trained to, like, pull things.
[61:30.95]So in order for her to stop them from being crazy and just barking all day long, she would have to, like, get on rollerblades and have her huskies tow her around the block.
[61:41.40]Those just seem like really badly trained dogs.
[61:44.77]No, it's like in their genetics.
[61:47.51]The thing about dogs, though, if you have a dog that's not trained well... Dog elitist.
[61:53.55]Yes, I am.
[61:54.69]It's hard to... Really, it doesn't matter what the breed is.
[62:00.66]If you have a dog that's not that well trained, they're probably always going to be an issue unless you can fix it, right?
[62:08.10]I know.
[62:08.62]They're going to apply otherwise.
[62:13.80]Yeah, I have to hit them.
[62:15.46]Often.
[62:16.57]Hey, what the hell?
[62:17.69]No!
[62:18.41]Get in there.
[62:20.69]Deposit all 40 of these.
[62:22.99]That increases a dog's aggression.
[62:25.43]FYI.
[62:25.79]Holy shit, this is a lot of beers going in here.
[62:29.51]It'll also make me hate you.
[62:32.39]Well, that was a lot of things deposited.
[62:35.90]Is that beer icon new?
[62:41.26]Yeah, I don't remember that from last time.
[62:43.87]There were a lot of people saying, what do I even do with the beer?
[62:46.11]So I guess there's a floating beer and arrow icon now.
[62:49.44]Yeah, they made it in like two minutes.
[62:51.88]Beer goes here.
[62:54.98]Best show on Animal Planet was the show about trying to prove Bigfoot was real, but at the end of the show they were just like, we didn't find any evidence, but he could still be out there.
[63:03.78]Dude, you just described shows on like the Discovery Channel and the History Channel and Animal Planet.
[63:09.54]You know, Bigfoot could be out there still.
[63:12.19]No.
[63:14.29]No.
[63:15.15]You never know.
[63:16.35]Some of the episodes of what was the show called?
[63:19.49]Monster Hunter?
[63:20.75]Try?
[63:21.11]Monster Hunter Try.
[63:23.79]Are you talking about a cartoon?
[63:26.01]No, the actual show.
[63:27.37]It was like a Monster Hunter show on History Channel.
[63:30.57]I forgot what it was called exactly.
[63:32.85]Some of the shows were just so bad.
[63:35.75]Like the Bigfoot one.
[63:37.03]That show did an episode on leprechauns.
[63:39.67]That's every Bigfoot thing ever.
[63:41.25]They tried to find leprechauns.
[63:44.45]Someone paid them to do it.
[63:46.03]Mermaids is the new evidence.
[63:47.58]They were grinning from ear to ear for the entire episode, like, yep, we're looking for leprechauns.
[63:54.64]I'm getting such a big paycheck.
[63:57.48]Leprechaun.
[63:59.66]We didn't find any, but they could still be real.
[64:02.38]They might still be out there somewhere.
[64:06.80]Yeah, we're gonna win anyways.
[64:09.86]There's no reason to just go on a spree right now.
[64:12.92]Oh, come on.
[64:16.08]Come on.
[64:16.94]Come on.
[64:18.08]Whoa.
[64:22.60]It's getting scary.
[64:24.77]Creep.
[64:28.85]Alright, I think we've got to fill this map.
[64:32.71]Jersey Devil is real, by the way.
[64:36.03]My mom heard a story about this guy that told us that.
[64:38.30]You're the goddamn devil.
[64:40.51]They did an episode on the Jersey Devil, and they said we'd go look for it, but we're too scared.
[64:44.01]We already know it's real, so we're not going to.
[64:45.49]We're going to go to Leprechaun instead.
[64:48.21]Jeremy, we probably need to stop staring at the UFO when you're in the beam.
[64:51.87]I'm a bug, dude.
[64:52.63]You know, like moths.
[64:53.57]I just have to, like, stare at it.
[64:59.94]What's the one that I didn't play?
[65:00.98]The arena map?
[65:02.54]Bri.
[65:03.08]Is it Bri or Byer?
[65:06.08]Briar.
[65:06.68]I don't know.
[65:07.42]Can we have a serious talk about your overlay?
[65:09.30]It's Byer.
[65:10.76]What's wrong with it?
[65:12.72]Can I make you one?
[65:14.93]Can it be anything else?
[65:16.27]If you want to make me an overlay, it better still have that guy's face.
[65:19.87]Why?
[65:21.33]Why does it need Grover on it?
[65:24.21]Did you just ask why Grover has to be on there?
[65:27.47]Yes.
[65:30.74]I don't even know where to start.
[65:33.00]I would say it just needs to be animated so people know it's not, like, offline.
[65:38.54]I don't know.
[65:39.26]I'm talking about animated shit.
[65:42.98]I am an animator.
[65:44.08]I could animate the Grover face.
[65:45.48]Can you animate me Grover?
[65:47.58]I could.
[65:47.94]Like, drinking a milk and being like, drink your milk, Hitch!
[65:51.77]No, because that would be a mute reference.
[65:54.19]That's a mute reference?
[65:55.39]Yes.
[65:55.83]He says that all the time.
[65:58.37]Well, that's what Grover taught me to drink my milk, and I drank it.
[66:02.15]He was the one that taught you to drink your milk?
[66:03.65]I don't think you can add sound file to it, Jerma.
[66:07.30]What do you mean?
[66:08.28]No, it's a word bubble.
[66:10.02]Add sound to what?
[66:13.36]Forget about it.
[66:15.60]I can envision this in my head.
[66:17.73]Do you give any super power to your toilet?
[66:19.47]What would it be?
[66:22.11]Um... The power to...
[66:27.28]There is no superpower you can give your toilet.
[66:29.51]I would give my toilet mind reading power so it would know when to open and close because I need it.
[66:34.23]Unless it was like an asshole.
[66:36.31]Who cares though?
[66:38.07]That's a one second solution.
[66:39.51]This is how lazy store is.
[66:40.98]Are you that lazy?
[66:44.96]No, I just think it would be cool to have a telepathic toilet.
[66:47.98]Maybe like every once in a while they'll say something.
[66:49.74]I don't want my toilet to be sentient.
[66:51.16]That's fucked up.
[66:53.95]That's some real pee-wee Hermit shit, dude.
[66:56.15]Like, dude, you're talking about you want your toilet to be like, oh, it has, like, superpowers, and it has, like, sentience.
[67:00.96]Oh, please shit in me, please.
[67:02.02]You shit in that thing.
[67:02.98]You want that to, like, know what you're doing?
[67:05.10]No, if I had a sentient toilet, I would just... Oh, dude, what did you eat?
[67:08.41]It would just be like, oh, god!
[67:10.15]Make it quick!
[67:11.25]Okay, just go!
[67:14.87]Goddamn!
[67:15.89]And then you'd flush, and he'd be like...
[67:23.15]You just forced me to swallow that, you fucking monster!
[67:27.23]And then you'd get out of the room, you'd close the door, and you'd be like, fuck my god!
[67:30.59]No, I would say there's nothing you can do to stop me.
[67:35.41]And I'll be back later.
[67:36.78]Because it, like, doesn't have arms.
[67:42.80]And it can't move.
[67:45.16]And I'm gonna go eat a cuttlefish.
[67:50.86]What if they puked on you?
[67:52.50]That's the thing.
[67:55.56]But it would just be like crying at night.
[67:58.35]You'd be like trying to sleep and it would just be like, God.
[68:00.47]This is the most disgusting conversation we've ever had.
[68:03.85]God damn it.
[68:05.21]We've talked about like... He'd rip out of the wall and start fighting you.
[68:08.99]Oh my God.
[68:13.09]We've talked about like bunched up packages in men's pants.
[68:18.39]And how like...
[68:20.18]How noticeable it was.
[68:21.80]This conversation is, like, weirder.
[68:23.86]Bunched up packages.
[68:25.83]Yeah, see?
[68:27.23]You thought it was funny then, too.
[68:29.71]Just listen to what you just said.
[68:31.79]Bunched up packages.
[68:34.19]Yeah.
[68:35.85]I just think that's funny on its own.
[68:39.87]Really ergonomic.
[68:42.55]I'll draw Grover for you with a bunched up package, like, animated.
[68:47.48]For your overlay.
[68:48.52]How about that?
[68:51.83]Shit, that's so messed up.
[68:54.28]Grover!
[68:54.96]And he's talking to his toilet.
[69:00.88]Oh, boy.
[69:03.32]No, I would not want my toilet to have superpowers.
[69:05.72]I'm watching this while eating.
[69:07.04]Fuck.
[69:09.16]I'm sorry.
[69:10.38]Sorry, Bomzy.
[69:11.30]Have I played the game yet?
[69:13.60]Have I done anything?
[69:14.76]I don't think you've gotten a kill.
[69:16.80]No, I am dead serious.
[69:18.46]Did I just sit in the spawn?
[69:19.62]I don't know.
[69:21.35]I really have no idea if I was just sitting in the spawn.
[69:23.77]It probably happened.
[69:24.35]I don't know, maybe you had to spectate this round, because like 12 people have to spectate.
[69:32.90]I'll be back later.
[69:36.28]Oh, that is... That is next level messed up.
[69:39.66]Let's change the topic to something nicer, like... Alright, what's your favorite plant?
[69:44.70]Oh, Jesus.
[69:46.40]What's your favorite plant?
[69:49.00]I think I had to hit me in the face right there.
[69:51.67]Plant from Nuclear Throne.
[69:52.77]That's a good answer.
[69:56.21]My favorite plant is probably Snapdragon.
[69:59.24]I've answered.
[69:59.90]What?
[70:01.64]What?
[70:02.74]Snapdragon.
[70:03.86]You don't know what a Snapdragon is?
[70:05.26]You answered that so quick.
[70:06.70]Because that's my favorite plant.
[70:08.10]I know what my favorite plant is.
[70:09.31]Do you know what your favorite plant is?
[70:11.29]No.
[70:11.57]Her plant is her... Plant.
[70:14.85]Plant!
[70:16.51]Oh.
[70:21.97]My favorite place is Snapdragon.
[70:24.12]I can't get over it.
[70:25.64]I can't get over the fucking toilet thing.
[70:28.80]God.
[70:29.40]It's going to be with me for a while.
[70:31.48]The guy in chat asked a really good question.
[70:33.34]It's the toilet clogs.
[70:34.42]Does it choke and die?
[70:36.14]No.
[70:37.00]Then you have to pee in a dead toilet.
[70:39.44]Jesus.
[70:41.56]Pretty much have to already.
[70:42.74]Alright.
[70:43.87]Let's see what we're going to spectate.
[70:44.93]We're going to spectate...
[70:48.11]thought Jerma would say sunflower.
[70:50.21]You have to give your toilet one bunny.
[70:51.28]That is a very good point.
[70:54.40]Very good point.
[70:55.20]Have you mentioned sunflowers before or something?
[70:57.90]No, no, they're just really, really big and cool looking.
[71:01.56]This person knows you pretty well.
[71:03.43]Impress us, shell.
[71:06.03]Come on, get that sniper.
[71:08.05]That's your kill.
[71:08.85]You gotta get that.
[71:09.89]This is the whole team right here.
[71:11.05]They don't even know.
[71:11.59]We're gonna spectate a
[71:15.43]Alright, this guy.
[71:16.87]Alright.
[71:17.31]No, we're gonna... Okay.
[71:20.75]You got this.
[71:21.79]You're gonna go in there and you're gonna be the laggiest guy in this whole server.
[71:27.77]He got somebody.
[71:28.79]He got him.
[71:29.67]The chat is being silly.
[71:31.61]Aww.
[71:36.16]Tell Star that they do make toilets with sensors that will lift a lid when you get near it.
[71:42.02]I like the toilets.
[71:42.94]I've never gotten to try one, the Go Go Nippon toilet that spits in your asshole.
[71:47.86]I'm really curious.
[71:53.10]I think the one apartment we looked at had one of those toilets.
[71:58.26]What?
[71:58.46]It did?
[71:59.80]Yeah, that one that had the fish smells.
[72:02.86]It had one of those toilets.
[72:04.07]Oh gross, I'm so glad we didn't go there then.
[72:06.23]You don't have to do it.
[72:08.85]Yes you do, you have to do it at least once.
[72:12.14]You do.
[72:14.28]You really do.
[72:15.34]You really do.
[72:20.54]We got it.
[72:22.26]Shaking that off there.
[72:23.46]I'm so glad I avoided that.
[72:25.48]I know.
[72:27.84]I don't think, I mean... Fish apartment.
[72:31.45]I don't know.
[72:31.91]I'm trying to think of, like, if it wasn't Snapdragon.
[72:37.37]Cactus.
[72:39.65]And I'm not talking, like, the little cactus that your doctor has in his office.
[72:43.05]I'm talking about the big-ass Wile E. Coyote cactus.
[72:47.81]The Super Mario cactus with the arms that stick up.
[72:51.19]That's my second favorite plant.
[72:53.23]I like how long between talking about plants you've brought it back up again.
[72:57.63]So Sunflower is number three.
[72:58.97]I just walked right into a heavy, by the way.
[73:02.21]Jerma loves snapdragons and cactuses, and he's a really big plant guy.
[73:08.69]How do redwoods factor in your plant discussion?
[73:12.39]Redwoods?
[73:13.34]Yes.
[73:13.84]The tree redwood?
[73:15.14]Yes.
[73:15.82]Is it a plant, actually?
[73:17.00]They're the largest plant on the planet, Jerma.
[73:22.92]That's what I think about them.
[73:26.58]I thought that would influence.
[73:27.98]Oh, what's your favorite animal?
[73:29.41]Non-domestic animal.
[73:30.31]Armadillo.
[73:30.67]Because you're gonna say, like, dog.
[73:31.71]Armadillo!
[73:32.71]Got it.
[73:33.21]Armadillo.
[73:34.37]That's a good one.
[73:35.19]Armadillo, for sure.
[73:36.71]That was a really good one.
[73:37.69]Mm-hmm.
[73:37.99]Would you have an armadillo as a pet if you could?
[73:41.93]If it was, like, legal and they weren't, like, a wild animal, maybe.
[73:46.00]Okay.
[73:48.26]Yes.
[73:49.12]And it has the flame-on powers.
[73:50.96]Just get a hedgehog.
[73:52.12]Like, this big thing.
[73:54.49]What, the human flame?
[73:55.29]Are you telling me it's got human flame powers?
[73:57.70]There's no human flame!
[73:58.94]I need to stop talking so I can get a kill.
[74:01.54]Someone linked a picture of Wumpa on his toilet.
[74:04.42]That's not... I would not want that toilet.
[74:06.64]Can I... should I click on it or no?
[74:08.20]Yes, you should.
[74:10.22]Okay.
[74:10.36]Jorma should click on it too.
[74:11.38]Ew, what the fuck?
[74:12.96]Oh my god, that guy again!
[74:15.00]Ew.
[74:15.72]Give me a break.
[74:17.74]Ew, ew, ew.
[74:18.70]Oh, I am seeing that in all of my dreams.
[74:21.44]I'm not clicking on any of that shit.
[74:24.38]It's drama.
[74:25.50]I ain't clicking on it.
[74:27.17]She's overreacting.
[74:28.23]She's trying to get more subscribers.
[74:30.59]I'm never clicking on that.
[74:32.03]Don't try to get me to click on that.
[74:33.81]Who linked that?
[74:36.61]No, it's really... It's not gory.
[74:40.23]Okay, alright.
[74:41.55]This is a G-rated stream, guys.
[74:45.93]This is a general G-rated audience stream, okay?
[74:50.02]I don't want to see that shit.
[74:53.77]Get that fucking dumb shit out of here.
[74:55.79]G-rated.
[74:56.45]Come on, guys.
[74:58.69]As you're saying the word shit.
[75:00.89]That's a joke he's trying to make.
[75:02.21]He really stressed it.
[75:06.05]He really wanted to make sure people caught on to the joke there.
[75:17.04]Alright, can I play again?
[75:18.48]No.
[75:18.90]I'm gonna show you guys my...
[75:21.12]Why are you playing Arena on stream?
[75:23.66]Cause it gives me, you know why?
[75:24.82]Cause it gives me a chance to talk.
[75:27.06]You're always dead.
[75:28.24]When I'm dead, I can just be like, alright, let's talk about plants.
[75:31.80]I like Arena a lot.
[75:32.44]Did you see my last round?
[75:33.42]I got like three or four people in the last round.
[75:35.37]But you like survive in Arena.
[75:37.41]It's different.
[75:38.55]Did you just see the round that I just played as Scout?
[75:40.45]I got like four people.
[75:41.95]Who's your favorite Ninja Turtle?
[75:42.75]Are you watching the stream?
[75:44.79]Right now you're equipping a sniper loadout.
[75:46.93]I know.
[75:47.79]Isn't it different and wacky?
[75:49.07]Yeah.
[75:51.53]Hotspin Sniper.
[75:53.77]You know it.
[76:01.58]See, we did it.
[76:03.12]Look at that.
[76:04.40]I was the final shot.
[76:05.20]Alright, who's your favorite next turn?
[76:14.12]Did anyone here play Jade Cocoon?
[76:20.11]I had some cool enemies.
[76:23.07]I had some cool designs.
[76:24.36]What was it for?
[76:26.32]PlayStation.
[76:27.88]The PS?
[76:29.42]The PS.
[76:30.14]Nice.
[76:30.88]PS1, PS2, or PS3?
[76:33.38]PS1.
[76:35.02]The first.
[76:38.21]There were a lot of cool games for PS1.
[76:45.50]That is the most random thought I've ever had.
[76:47.16]What the hell is going on with this guy?
[76:55.45]I'm pretty confused.
[76:57.93]I'm as confused as you could be.
[77:09.28]I blame that on that medic that was civilian-ing around.
[77:13.67]I probably would have if I didn't freak out at that.
[77:15.47]That was weird.
[77:19.33]What are some other good PlayStation 1 classics?
[77:22.36]I was talking to Ashley the other day about Vagrant Story.
[77:24.54]That's another one of my all-time favorites.
[77:27.40]A little lesser known like Jade Cocoon.
[77:33.85]Let's watch this guy.
[77:40.21]Jake Kuhn.
[77:41.03]The old Resident Evil games were pretty good too.
[77:43.99]Wait, wow, did we just both Resident Evil?
[77:46.39]Wow.
[77:46.99]Jinx, you owe me a Coca-Cola Classic.
[77:49.90]Yeah, I'll fuck you.
[77:50.94]Oh.
[77:52.42]You did not just say that, did you?
[77:55.42]On my G-rated street.
[77:59.93]It would have been a G-rated thing.
[78:01.33]Like, you know, they don't show anything.
[78:06.82]On my G rated stream you're gonna bring that up.
[78:12.23]Thanks Okay, well moving on The old um, I forget what they were called Turn-based mech games was like it wasn't mech warrior turn-based mech game.
[78:27.85]Yeah, those are really good.
[78:28.89]Oh
[78:36.56]Did I do it in time?
[78:39.09]Apparently not.
[78:44.15]No, MechWarrior?
[78:45.27]I don't think it was MechWarrior.
[78:47.55]That was an old PC game.
[78:49.31]Xenogear.
[78:54.52]It has like seven games.
[78:58.54]Front mission.
[78:59.14]That guy got it.
[78:59.80]That guy wins.
[79:00.46]You have to give him a lot.
[79:01.20]Okay, why is this shooting out regular pills?
[79:04.53]Everyone who said Front Mission was a winner.
[79:06.55]There's a lot of weird shit going on in this server.
[79:08.55]This is the Iron Bomber.
[79:09.43]Why is it shooting regular Demoman pills?
[79:16.45]Okay.
[79:18.99]Alrighty then.
[79:19.61]It should shoot chickens.
[79:21.21]That's what it should do.
[79:24.71]Armored Core as well, actually.
[79:25.85]You know, Dark Soul people made Armored Core.
[79:29.96]It's quite the good game.
[79:31.82]I do remember Armored Core.
[79:33.14]I would actually freaking love to, like, PvP you in Armored Core.
[79:37.30]It'd probably be fun.
[79:42.17]You should get it.
[79:43.27]I'll come over.
[79:43.83]I would have to, like, unlock all the stuff, too.
[79:47.33]You have to, like, make a mech.
[79:49.89]You are coming over, though, right, Jerm?
[79:52.39]You better come over early so we can do something.
[79:54.45]Someday.
[79:56.20]What?
[79:56.68]This doesn't sound like a commitment.
[79:58.26]I'll come over like... Friday.
[79:59.62]Someday.
[80:00.16]Friday.
[80:05.54]Alright, I'm gonna go... I'm gonna go new server.
[80:08.96]This time I'm just gonna do... I'm just gonna do like a regular payload map.
[80:13.86]Oh, I'm not convinced.
[80:15.84]Then I'm gonna go to payload upward.
[80:17.36]Oh, but you're gonna come over...
[80:23.01]I'll be there in, like, three days.
[80:27.81]Is that how long the traffic's gonna take you?
[80:29.57]Yeah, I'm leaving tomorrow.
[80:33.76]You two non-drivers.
[80:38.38]Hey.
[80:39.26]You two non-vehicle operators.
[80:41.82]I have my driver's license.
[80:43.46]Actually, that's a good question.
[80:44.56]Like, what are you... You gonna leave your car in, like, the train station parking lot for, like, three days?
[80:50.40]That's what you do when you do something.
[80:54.09]Do they charge you money?
[80:55.09]Like a lot of money?
[80:56.11]It's like $1,000.
[80:57.57]No.
[80:58.19]You come back and it's like full of... $1,000?
[81:01.21]No, it's not.
[81:03.03]I know.
[81:06.14]What the heck?
[81:07.72]What's going on here?
[81:12.62]Alright, we are on a Borneo server now.
[81:14.98]And I'm going to play... I'm going to play cart heavy.
[81:26.99]I'm gonna play the heavy that sits on the cart.
[81:32.47]Is Grover still on?
[81:35.09]Ow.
[81:36.85]On Sesame Street?
[81:37.79]Yeah.
[81:38.33]Do they still do Grover segments?
[81:40.32]You're asking us?
[81:43.28]Yeah.
[81:45.40]They still do Sesame Street?
[81:48.34]Yeah, didn't you hear the news?
[81:50.28]What was the news?
[81:51.34]Kermit got a new girlfriend.
[81:53.28]Really?
[81:55.32]Oh, wow.
[81:55.68]Kermit's got a new GF.
[81:59.31]I read, like, a forum post that was like, it was good because she was, like, a domestic abuser.
[82:04.77]Glad he left her.
[82:06.37]She was kind of, like, into BDS.
[82:09.23]What are you talking about?
[82:10.27]Like, the hi-yah.
[82:13.02]She did the hi-yah.
[82:14.14]Yeah, yeah.
[82:15.90]Hi-yah.
[82:19.59]Frank Oz.
[82:22.23]Good old Frank Oz.
[82:23.39]That's a big century.
[82:24.47]Can I cheeseball it?
[82:25.64]Let's find out, ladies and gentlemen.
[82:26.94]That's a good point, Mute.
[82:28.36]Kermit is not Sesame Street.
[82:30.34]That's the Muppets.
[82:32.02]Wow, okay.
[82:33.64]It's been a while.
[82:36.54]Kermit's on Sesame Street sometimes.
[82:42.03]Isn't he?
[82:44.13]Yeah.
[82:44.35]Isn't Sesame Street the Jim Henson Company?
[82:49.08]Well, I mean, they're all owned by... That was the connection my brain was making, but... It doesn't count.
[82:55.22]Mewtwo, it doesn't count.
[82:56.12]It doesn't count.
[82:56.86]Move on.
[82:58.14]You can see I'm all caught up with my television shows.
[83:05.93]Can I do a Kermit impression?
[83:07.29]Everybody has a Kermit impression.
[83:08.61]You don't need to hear mine.
[83:10.65]Wanna hear mine?
[83:11.49]Yes.
[83:11.97]Yeah.
[83:13.83]Good.
[83:15.33]Got him.
[83:16.21]Good.
[83:17.00]Good.
[83:22.92]Ah, you can't headshot me.
[83:24.50]Katz just fell down.
[83:29.66]Nice backstab.
[83:34.09]There's a chapter in a book I read about a lady that hallucinated an image of Kermit the Frog in the corner of her vision for three months.
[83:43.17]It was just like a stationary image of Kermit, like overlaid on top of what she was looking at.
[83:48.55]Was she doing some hard drugs?
[83:50.54]No!
[83:51.02]It's like a brain condition.
[83:52.38]Really?
[83:53.50]Yeah.
[83:54.38]Wow.
[83:54.82]That's... That's pretty insane.
[83:56.84]Jeez.
[83:58.28]She's like, I don't even like that character.
[84:00.14]I don't even watch that show.
[84:01.65]Why am I seeing it?
[84:03.49]It's really weird what, like, the brain does when you're, like, not, like, unconscious mind.
[84:09.11]It's really weird.
[84:11.21]They said that sometimes he changed, like, emotions, but, like, for no discernible reason.
[84:15.71]She had a Kermit HUD?
[84:18.59]Pretty much.
[84:19.45]No, that's what this guy just said.
[84:21.69]A Kermit HUD.
[84:23.32]Yep.
[84:23.94]That she couldn't uninstall.
[84:25.84]What do I read?
[84:26.44]It's a book called Hallucinations.
[84:27.88]It was really cool.
[84:29.14]And she wasn't lying.
[84:31.72]Which was proved to how?
[84:33.44]Wasn't there a case where some lady woke up one day and knew French, and she never studied it and never knew it before?
[84:41.03]She just, like, had something happen?
[84:42.31]Wow, that sounded like an internet thing.
[84:45.16]No, I think that that was a real thing.
[84:46.76]Like, somebody had either a brain condition or something, and they ended up, like, learning a language that they didn't know.
[84:53.74]Somehow.
[84:56.36]Swear sounds legit somebody somebody will figure that out sounds legit like a Kermit hunt Why am I so cynic dude when you've seen as much battle as me It's not gonna be nice just go right now I'm supposed to be being card heavy, but I'm gonna be punch heavy now It's easy to transition Hey remember I was gonna be punch heavy
[85:26.48]Just kidding.
[85:28.26]Oh, oh.
[85:31.89]The person just got a French accent?
[85:34.51]Oh, she... Okay, that's what it was.
[85:37.13]Thank you, chat.
[85:38.67]So she just woke up one day with a French accent that she never had before, and she just was still... Yeah, yeah, no, just miraculously got on the news and was popular.
[85:49.31]fucking loser you don't know there's like the amount of difference in those two versions of the story bigfoot can be put bigfoot they didn't find him last season but they might next season there's a million snipers that way I'm gonna go this way I heard that someone had like a bigfoot hand in like some monk that he sold it and then they lost it hold on
[86:16.87]But if me and you ever hit rock bottom, like just everything falls apart, do you really want to dress up and go be Bigfoot with me?
[86:25.29]Yeah.
[86:27.73]Like, spend our last amount of money on, like, a Bigfoot costume and just go Bigfoot.
[86:31.93]One that costs at least, like, $15,000 to $20,000, right?
[86:34.50]With, like, fully animatronic face.
[86:36.74]Like the old Ninja Turtles movie.
[86:37.60]Yeah, and, like, stilts in the legs so you can be, like, nine feet tall.
[86:40.34]Yeah, but we need two of us in the costume for it to work.
[86:43.24]No, no.
[86:44.28]We could have two Sasquatches so people would feel overwhelmed and they wouldn't attack us.
[86:49.61]Because, I mean, you would shoot one Sasquatch, but when you see another one that can come kill you, you second-guess it.
[86:55.45]I need, like, little fake Sasquatch babies so people would, like, know.
[86:58.52]Like, oh, I'd better stay away from the Sasquatch babies.
[87:02.17]I can't even comprehend.
[87:04.59]I thought I got backstabbed, but he just shot me in the face.
[87:07.78]Jerma, we're making an important plan here.
[87:09.68]I already said yes.
[87:11.42]Yes, I will be the two horse person for Halloween this year.
[87:14.36]No, this is not a two horse situation.
[87:16.01]This is your Bigfoot and I'm Bigfoot.
[87:17.81]We're two Bigfoots together out in the woods.
[87:19.87]No, that's horrible.
[87:21.05]We're doing the two horse person.
[87:22.99]Oh my god, I'm not doing that.
[87:24.49]This isn't going to work.
[87:26.33]Which one of you is going to be the butt?
[87:29.36]I ain't being the butt.
[87:31.70]I'll tell you right now.
[87:34.32]I'm going to be the brain.
[87:39.21]Dude, you don't know the Sasquatch anatomy.
[87:40.73]Maybe the brain is in the butt.
[87:42.13]You're gonna be like a cat-dog Sasquatch with like two ends to it and no butt.
[87:46.18]Two faces.
[87:46.72]You guys don't even know.
[87:49.16]Dude.
[87:50.12]Okay, so if we do hit rock bottom, obviously you're not in on the Sasquatch thing.
[87:53.44]What do we do?
[87:56.69]If we hit rock bottom?
[87:57.99]Is that what you're asking?
[87:58.87]There's nowhere else left for us to go.
[88:01.67]Everything has fallen apart.
[88:03.20]They all have blackmail on us.
[88:04.58]There's footage of us killing nuns or something.
[88:08.44]Then we go be Sasquatch.
[88:10.57]That's my strat.
[88:11.81]Okay.
[88:13.63]Like people that try and run and like, oh, no one's ever going to catch me.
[88:17.10]I'm never going to jail.
[88:18.02]They never tried to be Sasquatch before.
[88:20.76]Then I'm going to just go work at, like, I don't know.
[88:27.31]Do I still get to work at a hardware store or something?
[88:31.01]No, Rock Bottom is like if people find you, you will go to jail.
[88:34.79]You owe so much money to the government, you will be in prison.
[88:37.95]The IRS wants you.
[88:39.47]Because you could not pay all these debts and everything.
[88:43.63]I would make a video and be like, Guys, I'm at Rock Bottom and I'm going to tell you how my plan to get out.
[88:50.47]And I would tell a detailed plan of how I was going to get out of it.
[88:54.67]And I'd be like, I'm going to do this.
[88:55.99]I'm going to get my life together.
[88:57.20]I'm going to do this.
[88:59.40]What do you want me to say?
[89:01.14]I want you to say, yes, I'll be Sasquatch with you.
[89:03.82]That's not going to happen unless we do the two Sasquatch.
[89:07.04]I'm not doing two.
[89:08.34]Then you're not going to get a yes from me.
[89:10.59]You'd be living the rest of your life in a suit with me.
[89:13.35]Do you really want that?
[89:15.67]With a suit with no butt.
[89:17.07]Think about that.
[89:18.13]Did that guy not die?
[89:19.13]Yeah.
[89:22.95]I really feel like our friendship's being tested right now.
[89:25.15]No, but we could... Who said we couldn't get out of the costume?
[89:30.11]Well, someone sees us getting out of the costume and it's all blown.
[89:34.12]The whole thing is done.
[89:35.80]So we have to live in the woods.
[89:36.98]We have to live in the woods is what you're saying.
[89:39.38]Yeah, we're pretty much hermits, but we're also dressed as Sasquatches to continue the lore of Sasquatch.
[89:43.88]Maybe someone will accidentally shoot us too with a hunting rifle.
[89:48.36]Unless one person in the chat said if you had a male one and a female one, then they couldn't kill you.
[89:54.27]As you know, there's like hope for the species.
[89:57.14]Yeah.
[89:59.96]And then maybe your financial trouble would be solved because you could sue the person who shot you.
[90:04.44]Get on that car.
[90:05.64]Sasquatches don't have rights, but people in Sasquatch suits do.
[90:09.27]I have an idea.
[90:10.19]How about we talk about something else?
[90:11.81]You're talking about living toilets again?
[90:15.73]How about that?
[90:16.03]How about we talk about something else?
[90:17.29]Way more important than any of this shit that you guys are bringing up.
[90:19.64]Where the fuck is Grover?
[90:21.68]If we can't talk about Sasquatch costumes, I think my knight's over here and I have to go.
[90:32.60]Excuse me.
[90:33.10]Alright, how fast do you think I can do the flamethrower?
[90:45.66]Pretty damn fast.
[90:47.16]Yeah, let's talk about that.
[90:51.58]You could make a YouTube channel and pretend to be homeless.
[90:55.41]But one guy already did that.
[90:58.41]How about I just... How about we just keep doing what we do?
[91:01.27]We're just hanging out and playing games and chilling.
[91:03.33]And then out of nowhere we hit rock bottom and we... We just, like, film himself laying in dumpsters like, guys, please.
[91:14.51]How do you have a computer to upload these videos, fake homeless guy?
[91:18.56]Don't ask.
[91:19.42]You go to the library?
[91:20.28]Don't tell...
[91:24.74]And then and then after that he would upload like videos of him like eating sushi like haha you mad Fastest clicker in the West See me in cookie clicker He's trying to be popular I really recommend that HUD, Jerma The Kermit HUD Just a picture of Kermit and like no other information I clicked way too many times and I lost my uh my ability to click
[91:57.67]What's your favorite fast food?
[91:59.14]Like McDonald's, Hamburger World, Burger King... Finagle Bagel.
[92:04.30]What?
[92:06.14]Finagle doesn't really strike me as what you'd call fast food.
[92:09.00]That is faster than hell, dude.
[92:11.41]It is Finagle Bagel?
[92:13.29]Finagle Bagel is fast food.
[92:14.99]Oh shit, I don't have it equipped.
[92:16.95]Right now, Finagle Bagel is my favorite place to eat in the world.
[92:19.73]So then I guess yes.
[92:21.23]Got my wisdom teeth removed.
[92:22.99]Got some oxy so I'm high.
[92:28.89]What?
[92:29.19]Are you serious?
[92:31.75]That was the quickest my guys ever died turning a corner.
[92:36.10]They crack eggs beforehand and they put them in a drawer.
[92:40.02]And they take out the eggs and put them on sandwiches.
[92:41.92]Hey, be careful with those things, man.
[92:44.26]They put eggs in a drawer.
[92:45.66]We're doing real talk for a second here.
[92:47.98]Be careful with that shit.
[92:50.81]Like, taking, like, the medicine from, you know, the dentist when you get your wisdom teeth out.
[92:54.77]Just be careful.
[92:55.31]Just know what it is.
[92:57.87]Be educated on it.
[92:59.27]And just take care of yourself, you know?
[93:02.14]My mom had to cut me off of my payments.
[93:04.46]Alright, that's the second time that's happened.
[93:06.34]I was like, man, it still hurts.
[93:08.42]That's the second time I've insta-died by this guy.
[93:11.56]She had no mercy.
[93:13.71]Holy shit.
[93:19.86]I really feel like that HUD would benefit you.
[93:22.66]Which HUD?
[93:23.42]The one that you use?
[93:26.33]Yeah.
[93:26.69]Just getting some HUD vibes.
[93:27.85]A lot of people over there.
[93:35.77]Aw, dude, Cheesecake Factory.
[93:39.25]Cheesecake Factory blows.
[93:41.17]I know, that's why you're not the perfect man.
[93:43.94]Why, you don't like Cheesecake Factory?
[93:45.94]Because he doesn't like it.
[93:47.50]The Cheesecake's good at Cheesecake Factory.
[93:49.72]I- I'm not gonna contest that, I haven't tried it, maybe it is, but like, as a restaurant, it's just like- Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, but back up a second.
[93:55.65]You were tell- you just said cheesecake, the Cheesecake Factory blows.
[94:01.11]And you have not eaten the cheesecake from the Cheesecake Factory.
[94:06.23]As a restaurant experience, where you sit down and eat and have food, it's extremely mediocre.
[94:12.17]Do you remember why it's mediocre?
[94:13.72]Do you know what- do you know what the name of the restaurant is?
[94:17.20]Cheesecake Factory.
[94:18.90]Okay.
[94:19.85]No, no, do you remember why you didn't like the restaurant?
[94:22.97]Because all of the food is extremely mediocre and average.
[94:26.10]No, because the decoration was too fancy and it made you feel self-conscious.
[94:32.22]Too many fancy decorations?
[94:33.88]Okay, I don't like that Cheesecake Factory usually is a fancy establishment for how bad their food is.
[94:41.51]Oh my goodness.
[94:42.95]Alright.
[94:43.81]Retconning it to have something to do with the actual food.
[94:48.01]And no, because the first time we went to one, it was really fancy, and I was like in a t-shirt, and it was weird.
[94:52.77]So yes, I was self-conscious.
[94:54.13]I was like, maybe I should have worn some clothes.
[94:57.01]But you didn't put my pants on me, so I didn't.
[95:00.21]Yep.
[95:01.31]Sorry.
[95:03.56]Well... Every day, I keep forgetting to put your pants on you.
[95:07.86]You just go without.
[95:08.70]I'm trying to think of what my... What's my favorite restaurant that's like a chain restaurant?
[95:14.16]I don't know.
[95:15.74]Isn't it Moe's?
[95:17.37]no no no I mean like a sit-down restaurant you know what I mean you're sitting down you're with friends and family friends I don't know why I spilled that teleport when we're like all the way up here I can't even like think of one
[95:37.78]I feel like I'm in a room with my parents lighting.
[95:40.44]Philips, I think, is the name of the place.
[95:43.18]Philips?
[95:44.00]What?
[95:44.54]Philips.
[95:45.08]It's like a seafood place.
[95:46.24]There's a couple of them.
[95:47.36]I think that would count as a chain.
[95:48.58]There's one in the airport.
[95:50.28]Whoa!
[95:51.08]I did not expect there to be that many people here.
[95:53.38]What about Philips?
[95:54.10]You like it?
[95:55.04]Yeah, Philips is awesome.
[95:56.36]That dude's killed me every time I've been alive.
[95:59.11]Dude, IHOP.
[96:00.51]That's another good answer.
[96:01.39]This is the first reference to ever liking seafood that wasn't lobster macaroni I've ever heard.
[96:07.42]Okay, well, maybe you'll hear me say Phillips is good?
[96:11.32]If we're ever, ever near one.
[96:14.11]Weird.
[96:14.45]I'm like, married to you.
[96:16.35]I didn't... I never heard about this Phillips guy.
[96:19.99]I don't know, I don't know where any are besides there's one in Ocean City, Maryland.
[96:24.00]That I went to a lot.
[96:25.32]Oh.
[96:27.06]I guess it's like, Rocky Rococo's Pizza.
[96:29.86]I don't know, I like calamari.
[96:32.76]You like calamari, but...
[96:40.00]What's lobster macaroni?
[96:40.94]There's too many people!
[96:42.87]Delicious is what it is.
[96:43.85]And an Uber.
[96:44.89]Yeah.
[96:46.19]Philips sold out.
[96:47.47]Only experience I really do have with Philips is from Ocean City, Maryland, which is probably their best establishment just based on a location standpoint.
[96:56.40]Oh, spy, be a hero here.
[96:59.18]When were you- when was Stirrin' Ocean City?
[97:01.70]Didn't you go a lot?
[97:03.68]Uh, for- Die again!
[97:04.58]I went, like, every year for three years.
[97:07.06]What the fuck is going on with this time?
[97:08.14]Vacation.
[97:08.34]As a youngin'.
[97:09.80]Cause you can't say no to family vacations.
[97:12.75]Yep.
[97:12.85]I wanna play on- I wanna play on Upward.
[97:14.11]I'm gonna play on Upward.
[97:19.37]I'd go again.
[97:19.93]I actually really like Ocean City.
[97:23.61]Does it have Dippin' Dots?
[97:24.47]It has the Guinness Book of World Records, like, museum.
[97:28.87]There's a window at the beginning where it makes you look at the window or this mirror or something.
[97:34.47]It's like a mirror.
[97:36.07]It gives you some instruction.
[97:38.05]You have to squint at it or something.
[97:39.97]And when you get all the way to the end of the museum, you come all the way around and you get to look at the idiots in the mirror because you can see through it.
[97:46.33]Now you ruined it for me.
[97:47.81]Yeah.
[97:48.60]Thanks.
[97:49.42]We're not going to Ocean City.
[97:50.54]I wouldn't let you be the person, the idiot, looking in the mirror.
[97:54.32]Aw, that's nice of you.
[97:55.70]That would really piss me off if I was.
[97:59.38]We're on bad water.
[98:01.14]I don't think I ever actually went in it.
[98:03.26]I just heard from a lot of people who had gone in it.
[98:07.42]Dippin' Dots.
[98:08.35]Dippin' Dots is... Dude, I'm ready for my yearly serving.
[98:13.99]My yearly spoonful of Dippin' Dots.
[98:17.73]My cousin ate Dippin' Dots one dot at a time, and I just... I can't contain myself when I have Dippin' Dots.
[98:24.16]I eat them so fast.
[98:25.82]I know.
[98:27.20]I could eat that all day.
[98:29.38]Remember when we were looking into, like, ordering Dippin' Dots from the internet, and the only way you could get them was, like, in dry ice crates, and you had to buy, like, five gallons of it.
[98:41.11]For your birthday party.
[98:42.45]Too many people.
[98:43.15]It's so worth it.
[98:44.65]What's Dippin' Dots?
[98:46.27]What's Dippin' Dots?! !
[98:48.75]Ten has like three bucks a dot.
[98:50.37]Oh, they are.
[98:50.77]Actually, that ice cream you got me is also very, very top tier of ice cream.
[98:56.42]Really?
[98:56.84]It's comparable to Dippity.
[98:59.50]It's comparable to maybe the best ice cream I've had.
[99:03.12]Dang.
[99:03.92]The best ice cream I've ever had probably really was...
[99:09.00]I don't know, I want to say it's like if you go to like an actual Ben & Jerry's store, not like go to the supermarket to get the pint.
[99:16.66]If there's like a Ben & Jerry's ice cream place, they're double fudge, like fudge chocolate brownie ice cream.
[99:26.43]Oh my god.
[99:28.31]With the huge fudge chunks.
[99:31.33]It's like eating a brownie and like a milkshake and it's just everything that's amazing about the world and life in general.
[99:41.54]PinkBerry, shout out PinkBerry.
[99:43.34]Sponsor me.
[99:47.62]PinkBerry's cool.
[99:48.68]What if, like, Mr. PinkBerry was in chat right now?
[99:50.88]Would you freak out?
[99:53.11]I would decline the sponsorship and say it wasn't true.
[99:55.87]Because it's not PinkBerry?
[99:59.01]I'm not gonna sell out to you, PinkBerry.
[100:02.39]Another sentry over there?
[100:07.01]But what if you could have, like, a personal Pickberry guy who would just, like, serve it to you anytime you wanted?
[100:13.49]Yes.
[100:14.43]Yes.
[100:15.01]I'd sell out really quick for that.
[100:25.89]Oh my god, there's so many people, I wish there was a demo right now.
[100:33.30]I can like, I'm hallucinating Dippin' Dots right now.
[100:35.89]Alright, let's take this in here.
[100:38.37]Just think about sesame chicken instead.
[100:41.05]Oh, now I'm hallucinating that!
[100:43.03]Very suggestible, because I'm very hungry.
[100:49.30]There's a game going on.
[100:50.86]Am I even over it still?
[100:52.88]I guess I am.
[100:55.06]Dippin' Dots have been the ice cream of the future for 20 years.
[101:00.09]This is the team of fucking engineers, holy shit.
[101:05.34]This is like watching Ster's old streams.
[101:08.72]You have two medics.
[101:12.00]Everyone is Kaga-ing in spawn.
[101:15.12]Everyone's trying to high-five you.
[101:16.89]Yep.
[101:18.67]This is like when I stopped streaming TF2.
[101:20.95]I wonder if they can get dip and dots in Boston.
[101:24.45]I'm gonna look.
[101:26.89]I think so.
[101:28.03]Oh, he's so low and I didn't get the last couple hits.
[101:30.19]This is still a teleporter.
[101:31.05]We gotta go to that place one of these days and get the lobster mac and cheese.
[101:35.27]We do.
[101:35.91]Lobster mac and cheese.
[101:38.97]I still don't remember the name of that place.
[101:40.96]Oceana.
[101:42.54]Something like that.
[101:43.56]Who did I kill?
[101:45.94]Corporate headquarters for Dippin' Dots is in Massachusetts.
[101:52.65]Is it really?
[101:53.63]Yes.
[101:54.77]The headquarters of Dippin' Dots.
[101:56.51]The HQ.
[101:57.01]Let's send them a message and ask for a tour.
[101:59.85]The corporate office.
[102:01.82]You think they do tours?
[102:03.42]If they do, let's do it.
[102:04.94]That would be so fun.
[102:06.60]Ooh, it's right next to us.
[102:09.54]Wee!
[102:11.00]Wee!
[102:15.93]We'd probably be... What if we were the only people there over, like, 12?
[102:21.71]The Dippin' Dots Factory!
[102:23.59]Wait, no, I think this is Rhode Island, actually.
[102:26.97]It's to the south of Massachusetts.
[102:28.29]I was wrong.
[102:29.49]I didn't see the little dots in the map.
[102:30.87]Wow, way to get our hopes up.
[102:34.23]South of Providence.
[102:35.33]That's not far.
[102:35.91]Rhode Island is tiny.
[102:44.09]Actually, a train does go into Providence.
[102:49.58]I smell a road trip.
[102:51.63]Road trip.
[102:53.41]Ow.
[102:54.15]Yeah, we're not driving people.
[102:56.03]We wouldn't understand though.
[102:57.75]Let's rent a bus and just pick up- Let's rent a bus and pick up the whole chat.
[103:03.08]Yeah!
[103:03.54]That's a really long bus.
[103:12.14]Would you even be able to turn that bus?
[103:14.36]It would be like playing a real life game of Snake.
[103:18.17]Yeah, that way we can start a biker gang, you know, whenever you see like a whole bunch of bikers driving by.
[103:22.12]It's like, oh, whoa, who are those guys?
[103:23.42]That's cool.
[103:24.40]Guys are so awesome.
[103:25.38]Please make really loud noises.
[103:26.86]Oh, this is awesome.
[103:28.70]And then we'll just all be in the chat doing the Dippin' Dots.
[103:32.08]There is a Dippin' Dots place that is 1.3 miles away.
[103:35.85]Go, run, Heavy.
[103:36.65]Run.
[103:36.85]You have the power of speed.
[103:37.81]Dude.
[103:44.25]I wouldn't recommend people use speed.
[103:49.08]The power of speed.
[103:53.74]That's a drug, Gemma.
[103:56.58]No, like fast going, moving fast speed.
[104:00.42]Yeah, that's how they get you to take it.
[104:02.80]I want to get in here and get everybody with a crit.
[104:05.08]Aw.
[104:10.86]Bosses don't work like snakes do.
[104:12.74]Diarrhea dots.
[104:14.11]Ew.
[104:18.72]I could actually really go for some fried calamari.
[104:23.39]I'm not really a fan of calamari.
[104:26.35]It's a little too salty for me.
[104:29.87]Well, then get it less salty.
[104:33.03]I could do that.
[104:34.21]No, you gotta build up your salt tolerance.
[104:36.80]Like, just eat raw chunks of salt every day.
[104:39.20]Ew.
[104:41.66]Talking about salt makes me want to be like,
[104:45.13]really lazy and eat like four cups of cup ramen noodle thingy.
[104:50.35]That's what salt always makes me think of.
[104:52.87]That's sodium.
[104:53.89]Those things are delicious.
[104:54.73]Those things are average.
[104:57.85]Oh, come on.
[104:59.95]Don't say that.
[105:01.09]Ramen, like the cup noodle stuff, it's such a great when it's really cold out and you just sit there and you've got the broth and you're sipping it and shit.
[105:09.84]You get to the very bottom...
[105:12.02]Stuart has seen a mind of a chef which like went back to the origins of ramen.
[105:16.92]No, he just talked about why ramen was cool and it opened my mind and then I had really good ramen at that place we go and it's like my... My mind has been blown by how good ramen can be.
[105:28.33]If you come and visit, we're gonna go to that place and we're gonna blow your ramen mind.
[105:32.50]Actually, I don't know, maybe on the day we come back we could go.
[105:36.62]I would go.
[105:38.64]You will have at least two of the best things you've ever eaten.
[105:43.53]Sounds good.
[105:45.67]I like things that I like to eat.
[105:47.15]Sounds like a plan.
[105:50.86]Wow, how controversial.
[105:52.74]I like things that I like to eat.
[105:55.68]I actually have a lot of things that I like to eat.
[105:58.28]Wow.
[105:59.04]There's many things that I like to eat.
[106:01.00]How open-minded.
[106:01.84]Only a few things that I don't like, the rest I would eat.
[106:05.54]Like, I don't like shellfish.
[106:08.62]Other than that though, I like pretty much everything else.
[106:12.65]I thought you were a spy.
[106:17.02]Like all other food except shellfish.
[106:20.26]Pretty much.
[106:20.98]That's the only thing I would... I'm like, I don't want that.
[106:23.55]I don't want that.
[106:24.69]As cargo?
[106:25.19]I don't know.
[106:29.57]Snail, right?
[106:31.01]Yes.
[106:32.43]I don't know.
[106:33.67]It'd be tough.
[106:35.81]Oh shit, it's this guy again.
[106:37.65]Isn't a snail almost like a shellfish?
[106:39.95]It's like a shell, not fish.
[106:45.28]It doesn't... I just don't like the whole idea.
[106:50.18]I don't know, I just don't like it.
[106:54.53]Lobster macaroni.
[106:56.28]Uh, do you like raw bugs is a question.
[107:00.68]Bugs.
[107:01.02]Do you like, do you like bugs?
[107:03.86]Also raw.
[107:04.84]They're not cooking these bugs.
[107:09.44]Ew.
[107:13.21]I swear there was some study.
[107:16.49]I'm gonna say that.
[107:17.13]When I don't know what the hell I'm talking about, I'm just gonna say there was some study.
[107:19.65]You were paying so little attention, you went the whole way out of spawn, by the way.
[107:23.55]Yes, I did.
[107:23.79]I know.
[107:24.83]I'm aware of this.
[107:26.43]I figured that out.
[107:28.01]You, like, jumped around shooting rockets like you're doing something.
[107:31.55]My brain is trying to piece together the thing I was just gonna say.
[107:34.47]And I don't even... What was it?
[107:37.28]What was the last three words I said?
[107:40.93]Do you remember?
[107:41.29]I don't know.
[107:41.57]There was some research that... There was a study.
[107:43.65]There was a study.
[107:44.33]Are we talking about... From the same people who taught the lady French.
[107:52.15]I don't know.
[107:53.40]It's gone.
[107:54.28]It's just gone.
[107:55.52]Alright.
[107:56.54]It's gone.
[107:57.10]Something about bugs.
[108:01.94]Oh shit, that's not a shotgun.
[108:02.82]There was a study.
[108:04.34]That's the end of the story.
[108:05.98]I know there was a study done at one point.
[108:10.27]I think it involves shellfish.
[108:11.99]It'll come to me.
[108:16.25]I think your team is winning.
[108:18.19]I hope so.
[108:20.84]Winning.
[108:24.66]That's like one of my least favorite things.
[108:27.48]Winning?
[108:28.74]Yeah.
[108:29.92]Winning.
[108:30.92]You just said it.
[108:33.63]Winning.
[108:35.13]Charlie Sheen here.
[108:38.05]I watched that interview live, yo.
[108:40.23]Don't know why.
[108:40.79]I don't know either.
[108:43.83]And then the meme came out and I was like, I was there, man.
[108:46.49]I was there when he was winning.
[108:48.29]Oh my god.
[108:51.66]This fucking guy.
[108:52.78]Can I have like a brain shield?
[108:59.10]Can I put a thing on my... Can I put like a fucking astronaut helmet on me to steal?
[109:03.04]Is this like the medic amulet?
[109:04.84]Yeah, I could really use the medic amulet right now.
[109:10.46]That'd be fantastic if I had that equipped.
[109:21.24]Studies are usually inherently flawed.
[109:22.90]I want some of that ramen, dude.
[109:26.72]Not usually.
[109:28.16]Aha!
[109:28.36]Boo!
[109:28.64]I spooked you!
[109:29.12]Boo?
[109:33.38]Is Boo in the car?
[109:35.59]Trying to scare that guy.
[109:38.45]Poor Boo.
[109:39.21]He has no idea.
[109:43.30]Bino, where is Boo?
[109:46.35]Yeah, what's he doing?
[109:46.99]What do you think?
[109:48.43]Um... Sleeping.
[109:49.35]Probably playing Rocket League.
[109:50.93]He's gotten very good at it.
[109:52.23]And he plays it a lot.
[109:53.59]I talked to him earlier.
[109:54.61]About Rocket League?
[109:56.05]And he said... He said he was going to bed.
[109:58.19]Did you?
[110:01.53]But how reliable is he?
[110:02.93]That guy just teleported.
[110:03.91]More reliable than Germany.
[110:05.59]What is with the teleportations?
[110:06.41]That's not a high standard.
[110:07.37]Alright, easy.
[110:16.43]I have to go to the potty.
[110:18.89]You better not.
[110:24.70]I went to it three times during the stream.
[110:26.66]That means it's mine.
[110:27.50]Alright, I don't want to cause any trouble down there.
[110:30.46]We'll see about that when it talks to me.
[110:33.87]Where is he?
[110:36.51]One day I'm going to wake up from a dead sleep.
[110:38.85]I should have done the same thing.
[110:42.66]When you see a spy in a tight corridor like that, you just start swinging in every single direction, and one of you will win.
[110:49.56]I didn't do that.
[110:50.09]I pulled out the revolver, which was a mistake.
[110:52.71]That was a smart idea.
[110:53.75]You just handled it very poorly.
[110:56.83]No, we both bumped into each other.
[110:58.35]He just went and he did the chaos stab.
[111:00.15]I should have done that.
[111:00.91]I didn't do it, and I died.
[111:02.92]The chaos stab.
[111:07.48]That's right.
[111:08.84]I broke my own rule.
[111:16.34]Oh shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit, shit.
[111:20.06]Get foiled on.
[111:24.41]He's looking for me.
[111:25.99]That wasn't a headshot, apparently.
[111:28.79]I think based on that scenario, I know that I could beat you in a knife fight.
[111:32.09]Oh, come on.
[111:37.68]I wonder how many times this guy has killed me.
[111:41.12]Probably like 12.
[111:46.68]There's no escaping him either.
[111:55.24]To be fair, he didn't swing in every single direction.
[111:57.08]He swung in a very specific direction, specifically at you.
[112:01.29]Yeah, that's true.
[112:02.87]I did not do that.
[112:05.99]Dude, let's play the drawing game.
[112:09.19]I've been wanting to do that for months.
[112:12.55]Draw game?
[112:15.29]The drawing game, remember?
[112:17.41]The vomit shield?
[112:18.69]I do remember the drawing game.
[112:21.19]The vomit shield.
[112:27.60]You were paying attention back then.
[112:29.70]I was.
[112:33.40]Not anymore.
[112:34.32]Now I'm trying to take out a sentry with his engineer over here.
[112:40.58]I don't think you just get- I don't think you get how this works.
[112:44.11]Get what?
[112:45.19]You're like playing spy on a server where everyone streams sniping you.
[112:48.52]I don't think you, like, get this.
[112:50.72]I can't do anything to combat it anyways, so who cares?
[112:56.18]Who cares, mate?
[112:57.22]Who cares, mate?
[113:02.60]And... Oh, he knew, he knew, he knew, he knew, he knew.
[113:06.16]Dammit, Jerma.
[113:07.30]I'm co-hosting your stream and I'm not a mod in your chat.
[113:09.80]I just got, like, bonked by the slow mode.
[113:12.96]Well, hold on.
[113:13.60]Let me get you a mod.
[113:14.54]There's a lot of people who aren't modding your chat, and it's really rubbing on them.
[113:21.42]Rubbing on them?
[113:35.36]Yep.
[113:35.58]Do the drawing game.
[113:37.10]See?
[113:37.54]That's what the people want.
[113:42.44]The drawing game.
[113:43.58]Back to the drawing game.
[113:46.28]Go poop.
[113:49.06]I'll allow it.
[113:49.74]Holy shit.
[113:50.20]Am I going to be able to stab this guy?
[113:51.97]But only ten seconds.
[113:58.09]Shit.
[114:02.39]Ow.
[114:03.71]How am I top scoring?
[114:10.05]Sturge just said, ow, as he went to the bathroom.
[114:12.87]Maybe he stubbed his tootsie.
[114:14.99]His tootsie?
[114:15.49]Yeah.
[114:16.96]It's possible.
[114:28.38]It is very possible.
[114:37.55]I like how your soldier looks.
[114:39.78]Looks very wise.
[114:41.70]It's just the Travelocity Gnome, that's really all it is.
[114:44.12]I see it now.
[114:46.30]Is this guy again?
[114:49.24]Are you shitting me, dude?
[114:52.20]What the fuck is this?
[114:58.92]What is going on?
[115:02.95]Did that guy have like 5500 HP?
[115:06.25]It's the robot fucking medic again.
[115:09.46]What is going on in this game?
[115:12.36]Wow, that was impressive.
[115:13.61]I don't even know why I'm trying to attack this guy.
[115:15.81]He was flexing hard there.
[115:17.19]The bullets are just bouncing off of him.
[115:18.93]I think it might be time to change games.
[115:21.03]Games?
[115:25.33]To the draw game?
[115:26.37]Did you just see what just happened?
[115:28.46]Yeah, the medic was a tank.
[115:32.00]Something's fishy in here.
[115:34.70]Something stinks.
[115:40.53]Something stinky.
[115:41.85]Something stinks in here.
[115:42.99]Really stinky.
[115:46.73]Look at my rocket jumping skills.
[115:48.78]They don't exist.
[115:51.58]There he is again.
[115:53.26]There's the robot tank.
[115:57.68]Maybe he's the alien, Jerma.
[115:59.04]Maybe he's the invader.
[116:00.26]Did we get invaded by civilian medic robot tanks with 10,000 HP?
[116:05.09]Yes.
[116:05.25]See?
[116:06.01]See?
[116:12.75]They put thought into this update after all.
[116:19.75]I got no cheese.
[116:21.57]We do have cheese.
[116:22.55]One more life and then I'm gonna go play something else probably.
[116:26.57]This isn't gonna be a pyro life.
[116:28.47]You know, we're gonna end out the TF2 run with a flog pyro run.
[116:33.30]Flog pyro.
[116:34.74]You're the bottom, it's time for the Sasquatch costume.
[116:39.18]Alright, it's time to get in that Sasquatch costume.
[116:42.08]Yep.
[116:45.07]If that medic comes back over here, I'm just going to feed off of him and then go crit people.
[116:49.21]Feed her.
[116:52.26]He missed the robot medic.
[116:53.20]It's kind of epic.
[116:53.92]There he is.
[116:58.74]Things do not add up.
[117:05.13]Shit just ain't adding up.
[117:07.07]I thought he was right there.
[117:10.69]I want to play the jogging.
[117:16.53]There he is.
[117:17.33]Now I gotta get one flog.
[117:20.31]I gotta get one turn the corner and flog.
[117:26.09]Don't worry, everyone is stream sniping you so they'll know to stay back.
[117:32.69]Shit happens, right?
[117:34.97]No it doesn't.
[117:36.31]Not to me.
[117:37.51]Yeah, not to me either, dude.
[117:40.27]Shit happens.

[118:17.85]Boo?
[118:19.66]I just want to play TF2.
[118:25.30]There's someone that's getting banned over and over, like, showing up.
[118:27.86]I know!
[118:28.06]And there's nothing I can do about it.
[118:30.56]There's a couple of things you can actually do.
[118:32.80]Well, I could.
[118:34.34]No, they're all going after that medic.
[118:36.28]That poor medic.
[118:38.75]No, that's, isn't that the robo?
[118:40.33]Oh, no, you were talking about Robo Medic.
[118:42.71]Yeah.
[118:44.86]There are, like, five people chasing around trying to uber-sub.
[118:48.18]What the fuck.
[118:50.88]What the fuck!
[118:53.72]Jarvis!
[118:55.20]Oh, Flawgestinator!
[118:59.95]Yeah, keep me over it.
[119:00.95]Keep me over it so I can, like, actually get out of spawn and hurt someone.
[119:05.69]Fuck you, Robo-Medic.
[119:06.65]Jarvis, why don't you have subs?
[119:10.77]Oh, shit.
[119:13.11]Dude, big wallies.
[119:18.21]You son of a bitch.
[119:23.37]Is it Droffle?
[119:24.09]Is that the name of it?
[119:25.32]I think it is Droffle.
[119:29.90]Ster.
[119:31.65]We need another guy.
[119:37.16]Mute?
[119:37.30]No, I'm tired and we need to get boys for it one day.
[119:41.24]Alright, we'll get some boys.
[119:42.50]We'll get some gentlemen.
[119:44.94]I don't want gentlemen, I want boys.
[119:51.42]Suggestible boys.
[119:54.28]So that wasn't what I'm going to do.
[119:55.50]Let's see, what am I going to do right now?
[119:59.95]banny ban you no banny someone said I think he was suggesting a boy I'm sure banny would play unlocked an invasion crate I don't even have an invasion crate I probably would nothing dropped alright I'm going to use the restroom I'm going to rest a little bit in the restroom
[120:27.67]And then I'm going to figure out, I might stop streaming.
[120:29.85]I might move to something else.
[120:31.05]I don't know.
[120:33.11]I'd recommend something.
[120:35.45]I think I might go.
[120:36.62]You're leaving?
[120:38.24]Possibly.
[120:39.60]This dog is licking its feet.
[120:41.00]I think that means it's time for bed.
[120:42.72]Oh, she's sleepy.
[120:45.30]That's what I mean.
[120:47.35]Yeah, this is live streamer bathroom time.
[120:52.32]You need to have one of those cameras everywhere for any room you go.
[120:56.28]And it has them all live at any time.
[120:58.00]So I'm going to have like a nine camera shoot inside my bathroom?
[121:01.81]Yeah, Twin Galaxies style.
[121:03.29]There's just going to be one in every corner everywhere?
[121:06.13]Yeah.
[121:09.37]That way you can cut it into a montage when you're done with multiple angles.
[121:16.46]Make a frag movie out of it.
[121:18.42]That would be pretty pretty stupid.
[121:23.30]Alright, guys, I'll be back.
[121:25.42]You two are leaving, I'm assuming?
[121:27.68]I guess.
[121:28.70]Alright, we're losing these two chumps.
[121:32.02]Good night, everybody.
[121:33.86]Thanks for hanging out on the stream, guys.
[121:35.26]It was fun.
[121:36.06]No problem.
[121:36.52]Be here Friday.
[121:38.13]He just killed... Come on.
[121:40.77]Didn't he get to say a formal goodbye?
[121:43.29]Unbelievable.
[121:48.61]Tell that Jerma he needs to eat the cheese.
[121:51.89]What cheese?
[121:54.21]I actually would play Mario Maker right now if this room was set up to be able to play it.
[121:59.12]I don't have my Wii U in this room.
[122:02.16]But hang tight.
[122:03.42]I will be back in a couple minutes.
[122:05.00]I'm going to grab a drink.
[122:05.95]I'm going to take the bathroom.
[122:08.19]I'm going to take the bathroom out of my bathroom and use it in my living room.
[122:12.17]I'll be right back.
[122:14.05]Hold on a second.
[125:11.22]Okay.
[125:12.32]I got some lemonade.
[125:13.02]I, uh, I don't know.
[125:17.01]What can I do right now?
[125:19.15]Just to kind of chill for a little bit.
[125:24.16]I don't know.
[125:24.76]Let's see.
[125:25.12]What do I got?
[125:25.54]What do we got on the steam library?
[125:36.16]Could play.
[125:36.90]I could play more Cryptarch, but that requires a ton of my focus.
[125:42.12]And I'd rather just chill for the remaining, like, however long I'm gonna stream for.
[125:51.39]Ahhhh.
[126:03.27]Hmm.
[126:06.32]So many games and yet nothing to play.
[126:15.17]Minesweeper?
[126:23.19]Starron actually went to bed.
[126:24.27]I think.
[126:31.78]Alright, maybe I'll do this.
[126:35.12]Give me a second, I will load it up.
[126:40.96]Yeah, that's a game that's really easy just to turn your brain off.
[126:46.08]You know what we'll do?
[126:47.62]How about this?
[126:49.62]For the last, I don't know, maybe 30 minutes, I'm gonna play Diablo 3.
[126:55.28]Just kind of run around and swirl in people, maybe.
[126:59.68]Or maybe I'll play Hearthstone and be terrible.
[127:03.52]Alright, hold on a second.
[127:04.74]I want to get this to see what you guys would rather see here.
[127:13.46]Oh, whoops.
[127:14.93]There is no game.
[127:19.79]I don't have a game to show you.
[127:20.85]Alright, I can either play Hearthstone and be terrible, Binding of Isaac, or Diablo.
[127:32.00]Which one?
[127:39.05]And I'm going to warn you guys.
[127:42.01]Watching me play Hearthstone is going to drive a ton of you crazy.
[127:49.74]Let's do a poll.
[127:51.14]I'm going to do one of those fancy polls that you see from time to time.
[128:10.79]Stop changing.
[128:14.87]This is going to be a very simple straw poll.
[128:31.59]Okay, I'm going to put it in the chat.
[128:33.69]Why not?
[128:43.29]And you have 30 seconds to vote, by the way.
[128:47.69]You have 30 seconds to vote on this poll.
[128:59.98]Well, Binding of Isaac seems to be destroying everything else right now.
[129:09.66]Alright, we're closing this out in like less than 30 seconds.
[129:20.94]Play Wonderbook?
[129:21.64]That is actually not a terrible idea.
[129:24.88]Not tonight.
[129:25.70]I definitely can't do it tonight.
[129:30.46]But... Damn, that would be really cool.
[129:34.16]Because those games are really funny and really crazy, but they're actually pretty interesting.
[129:38.15]Alright, it's very clear Binding of Isaac is winning by way too much for anything else to win.
[129:53.09]So yeah, where the poll is now closed, I'm going to play Binding of Isaac.
[129:55.95]This is going to be Binding of Isaac, and I'm just going to answer questions.
[130:00.53]This is going to be questions and answers Binding of Isaac time.
[130:06.44]So let's load that up.
[130:17.10]Dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun, dun.
[130:24.01]Go play a real game.
[130:28.47]Yeah, Binding of Isaac won by like, it was like 60% or something, or 50-something percent.
[130:36.95]I need to change my stream title to make sense.
[130:45.88]Because I'm not playing TF2 anymore.
[130:51.04]To make sense.
[130:52.28]Oh, no, I can hear myself.
[130:53.30]Shit.
[130:53.48]Oh, there's like an ad playing now, too.
[130:57.76]Oh, nice.
[131:00.48]Picking a Sasquatch.
[131:01.92]Messing with Sasquatch.
[131:04.66]I'm getting a messing with Sasquatch ad.
[131:13.66]Why do I think that's so funny?
[131:16.12]We were talking about Sasquatch this whole time.
[131:20.92]I wish I please tell you guys heard that.
[131:27.82]He's real.
[131:28.95]Sasquatch is real.
[131:30.71]I'm at rock bottom.
[131:33.93]I hit it.
[131:34.45]I hit rock bottom.
[131:44.01]Perfect.
[131:52.05]okay close that and I need to change this that's not right Binding of Isaac rebirth there it is so for the remainder I this is I'm just going to be chilling
[132:22.30]And I'm going to answer questions.
[132:24.26]How does that sound?
[132:24.94]We're going to do some questions and answers and answers.
[132:30.99]Currently on a -2, not doing hard.
[132:32.87]This is just hanging out.
[132:36.01]Take a sip of my lemonade.
[132:36.95]This is delicious.
[132:43.38]Are we going to get a Jerma rumble this holiday?
[132:46.38]I really sincerely hope so.
[132:49.92]But I can't guarantee it.
[132:52.17]I'm going to do everything in my power to do this particular video.
[132:56.51]Hopefully it happens.
[132:57.21]It's gonna be hard.
[132:58.91]I'm gonna do Cain.
[133:05.03]What inspired me to create Grandpa?
[133:09.07]Well, Grandpa... I think I've actually answered this before.
[133:12.47]It's based on my grandmother.
[133:17.01]That voice and that whole character is pretty much just my biological grandmother.
[133:24.04]She used to talk just like that.
[133:25.10]I would imitate her.
[133:26.94]She lived with us in the house when I was growing up.
[133:31.31]And that's kind of how it worked.
[133:37.21]Am I ever going to get real Platinum God?
[133:38.99]Absolutely no.
[133:41.59]Well, it depends.
[133:42.52]If the new Isaac expansion is really, really awesome and really fun, maybe I'll play the shit out of it.
[133:49.10]I don't know.
[133:53.94]I can't guarantee anything.
[133:55.78]Dude, guys, here's another thing.
[133:57.58]I don't even know what I'm gonna have for breakfast tomorrow.
[134:01.11]And, like, videos and all this stuff.
[134:03.23]I don't... I have no idea.
[134:05.07]I'm gonna try to make whatever I can make and do whatever I can do.
[134:09.47]But I seriously don't even know what I'm gonna do tomorrow.
[134:12.95]It's always a mystery.
[134:17.55]I'm using a controller right now, yes.
[134:21.47]I find it easier for me to use a controller.
[134:25.26]Oh shit, I'm stuck in here.
[134:30.42]Before I die from this guy.
[134:39.05]Did you go to college?
[134:39.81]Yes, I did.
[134:40.97]I did go to college.
[134:44.49]I have a bachelor's degree.
[134:48.19]And what do you know, I'm also a young bachelor.
[134:53.13]Hey, bomb buddy.
[134:57.79]Tremor, why are you bad at this game?
[135:01.40]Well, I'm not particularly great at any particular game.
[135:10.19]Maybe I was in my wonder years, kind of.
[135:17.75]What was my reaction when Star beat Cryptarch in a few hours?
[135:21.30]That's just what he does.
[135:23.64]That's just what he does.
[135:25.22]Star just beats every game and it plays it to its utmost.
[135:29.22]Like, he plays the shit out of it and beats everything.
[135:31.63]Before I even, like, have a chance to even download the game.
[135:37.75]That's just what he does.
[135:38.55]I'm a pretty good mobile game player.
[135:44.91]Where would the secret room be?
[135:52.05]I'm gonna guess right here.
[135:55.53]Please be right.
[135:58.21]Shit!
[136:02.41]Are you still doing volunteer work or did that magical idea of Ferrari... No, actually, I'll talk about that for a minute or two.
[136:07.65]I'm just gonna go.
[136:08.95]I'm not going in there.
[136:11.89]I did... I was at a volunteer at an animal shelter for eight months.
[136:16.99]I stopped a while back before I moved.
[136:22.17]It was a really interesting experience.
[136:24.98]I will gotta say.
[136:27.36]I walked dogs.
[136:29.38]I was a dog walker.
[136:32.90]Sometimes there were a lot of dogs in the kennels, sometimes there were like none.
[136:37.47]So some days it'd be kind of boring, you'd go in and there'd be like really nothing to do.
[136:41.41]There'd be like maybe one real dog there.
[136:43.43]But then, there was a very large amount of dogs that came in.
[136:48.89]And for a while, there was a lot to do.
[136:51.83]In fact, after actually the last, like... I'd say, like, a full, like, good seven months or something.
[136:57.10]Like, when I first got there, it was... I don't know.
[137:01.06]Hard to explain.
[137:02.62]But there was a... It was definitely a cool experience.
[137:05.62]If you like dogs, I would do it.
[137:08.64]If you like animals, why not?
[137:10.02]You don't have to do it forever.
[137:12.02]Just do it for as long as you can.
[137:14.86]Or just, you know, don't.
[137:17.93]Kittens or puppies?
[137:18.67]Well, I just said I was a dog walker, so fucking dogs, puppies.
[137:26.65]A dog walker?
[137:27.61]What a lame dude.
[137:28.80]It's volunteer work, man.
[137:37.54]It wasn't lame.
[137:43.85]I was still doing YouTube and stuff at the time.
[137:45.98]I've been doing YouTube for like five years.
[137:47.78]I also did wedding videos and stuff.
[137:52.80]I've been doing things.
[137:54.92]I don't do that anymore, but I did.
[137:56.20]No, I'm never going to do that with a cigar.
[138:05.85]Will you get out of there?
[138:08.53]Get out of there, dude.
[138:10.67]Oh my goodness.
[138:11.77]Please, come out of there.
[138:21.13]I want to explore.
[138:21.95]Remember when you were making a game?
[138:26.91]I think you talked about it.
[138:28.21]No, I wanted to write a book.
[138:29.89]And I did start it.
[138:31.24]But I came to the extremely quick conclusion that writing books is extremely difficult.
[138:38.38]So I wrote a bunch of stuff.
[138:40.62]And then life got in the way and I became too busy to even have enough free time to care about that.
[138:47.37]Unfortunately.
[138:51.30]Everyone keeps talking about Undertale.
[138:52.48]What is Undertale?
[138:58.60]This is a new game that came out?
[139:04.15]How come you lagged on Insane Aquarium?
[139:08.69]You mean like the third video I ever uploaded to YouTube?
[139:13.19]I don't know.
[139:14.37]Probably because I was on, like, a shitty, like, dogshit laptop that had, like, less than, like, two gigahertz of CPU speed.
[139:30.67]Really?
[139:30.95]It's not there?
[139:33.13]Did I just miss that or something?
[139:37.21]Hmm, I don't have enough money.
[139:43.41]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[139:44.11]Well, that's what I get for not paying attention.
[139:54.28]Too bad.
[139:58.46]Undertale is a game that has mixed reviews, and it's one of those games that is good because people say so, but I'm not saying it's bad.
[140:05.82]Well, every game is subjectively bad to somebody, you know?
[140:11.11]I don't want to go in there.
[140:11.73]Let's just get the boss.
[140:19.42]Do I watch anime?
[140:20.36]I used to.
[140:21.46]Not really anymore.
[140:24.12]Back when I was in college, I was really, like, into it.
[140:26.10]I thought it was really cool.
[140:27.04]And I can't, like, what the fuck?
[140:28.48]What am I doing?
[140:33.73]One coin.
[140:40.89]I... I'm confused of what actually just happened.
[140:43.78]I thought that was a troll bomb, and then a troll bomb spawned after that.
[140:46.42]Apparently.
[140:47.50]Apparently.
[140:53.14]No, really, I started to watch anime back when I was in college, because my TV was pretty much permanently on Adult Swim.
[141:03.67]And Saturdays, I believe, is when they did their big anime block, and I thought some of those shows were pretty good.
[141:28.89]I want to read this one.
[141:29.67]Let's see if I can answer it.
[141:32.23]After Monstro dies.
[141:36.01]Over the years of YouTube and life and all that other shit in the mix, what's the biggest thing that's changed for you?
[141:40.39]Or just what have you noticed that changed you?
[141:47.74]That's a good question because...
[141:51.11]I really feel like over the last at least couple of years, I've started to grow up and started to see, really see, I've been asking myself the questions, oh fuck.
[142:02.49]I'm being like the old person, you know, I'm like, oh, back then it wasn't like that, it was so much, we, back when we were kids.
[142:09.09]I've been doing that a lot lately.
[142:11.49]And I never, ever used to do that.
[142:13.98]But like, I'm seeing things now, like in either video games or in TV and movies, and I'm just like, what the fuck is this?
[142:20.71]You know, when I was like 19, so much cooler.
[142:25.38]But you come to realize literally that's every single person when they get older has that conversation with themselves.
[142:34.18]And also getting older too, like turning 30 was kind of, it's kind of scary.
[142:39.03]You know what I mean?
[142:40.43]It was a scary thing.
[142:44.95]When you get over that age, you're just kind of like, okay.
[142:48.47]I am 30 years old, what the fuck is going on in my life?
[142:53.83]You start to re-evaluate things that you're doing, you start to re-evaluate where you are, and where you want to be.
[142:58.78]I wouldn't say it's depressing, it's kind of like... Almost like eye-opening, you start to see things differently.
[143:11.81]I have a bunch of kids in my family now, my brother and sister both have kids.
[143:17.31]And it's just really weird.
[143:19.02]You start to see, like, your parents start to get way older, and it's... It's like, wow.
[143:24.71]Life just kind of keeps going, doesn't it?
[143:31.47]Let it go.
[143:34.47]Yeah, when you turn 30, you have that kind of... You have the let it go conversation.
[143:38.13]I've let it go.
[143:50.53]Turbo looks 8.
[143:53.17]That is, I guess, one thing that I have going for myself.
[143:56.91]I don't... I don't, like, look like I'm 30+.
[144:05.17]When I look in the mirror, I don't see, like, a 35-year-old.
[144:08.15]Even though I'm not 35, but, you know, you get the idea.
[144:13.33]Technology!
[144:15.19]Oh, no, no, no, no, this is this thing.
[144:16.77]Shit, I didn't want this.
[144:19.79]I actually don't like this at all.
[144:20.91]I thought it was one of the technologies.
[144:27.14]Favorite band is the Gorillaz.
[144:29.66]For sure.
[144:34.74]Since doing this whole move and everything?
[144:36.28]No, I've not been working out at all.
[144:38.64]Even a little bit before I moved.
[144:39.94]Like the last like four months or five months, I probably haven't been to the gym.
[144:47.03]Which that's... I gotta get back there.
[144:49.00]I gotta do that again.
[144:55.00]Open your face.
[144:57.88]Open your face!
[145:01.95]Am I fat now?
[145:02.65]I don't think so.
[145:04.39]I just made a video where you can see my whole body.
[145:08.39]I don't think I'm fat.
[145:21.31]Alright, where am I going here?
[145:30.48]Oh, and I'm Kayn.
[145:32.50]What?!
[145:35.32]What the fuck?!
[145:37.84]Oh, my goodness gracious.
[145:42.32]None of those were any good.
[145:50.07]Alrighty.
[145:54.64]Would I want to join a racing league for Isaac?
[145:56.40]I don't think I'm good enough at the game.
[145:58.64]To be Frank.
[146:01.04]I would lose every time.
[146:02.08]It would probably be fun to do it.
[146:05.80]But no.
[146:09.48]I love watching people speedrun and race.
[146:12.28]It's actually one of my favorite things to watch on Twitch.
[146:17.01]A lot of the speedrunners that do their streams...
[146:21.27]I've been really into Mario Maker.
[146:22.37]I've been really into watching Mario Maker streams.
[146:25.22]People that are, like, good at the game and, like, know what they're doing.
[146:28.44]I really like that a lot.
[146:43.94]Shit.
[146:52.10]Get him.
[146:56.42]What's my favorite noise or sound?
[146:58.34]Uh, okay.
[147:04.56]Uh, probably... Rain hitting a roof.
[147:10.88]That extremely distinctive rain hitting your roof sound.
[147:14.15]Yeah, you know what I mean?
[147:16.77]Like that, like...
[147:24.47]If I could make it rain like that, just that gentle heavy kind of big water droplet rain every night, I'd probably do it.
[147:30.45]Give my dog those superpowers.
[147:48.42]Shot speed up helps a little bit, doesn't it?
[147:53.94]the brain hitting your roof people's brains smashing into my roof if you could go back in time what point would you go to I wouldn't I would not I would not go back and I could explain why I wouldn't go back go look if you ask me if I'd rather go backwards in time or forwards in time
[148:22.27]I would probably say forwards in time.
[148:25.05]Like if you, if it was like, oh, you could go forward 10 years or backwards 10 years.
[148:29.43]I don't know, man.
[148:30.19]Like when growing up, you, like all the things that you can't do when you're younger.
[148:37.92]Like, oh yeah, go back to when you're like 15 again or like 12 again or something.
[148:42.24]There's so much shit you can't do.
[148:45.22]that you have to, like, wait again to be able to do.
[148:48.72]Nobody trusts you with anything, you're, like, younger, you know what I mean?
[148:51.18]Like, it's hard.
[148:52.89]Like, the teenage years can be... I mean, they're a great time.
[148:58.05]I bet you a lot of you guys are probably, like, in your teens.
[149:00.73]I would assume probably half you guys are, like, in, like, that, you know, 15, 16 plus, maybe college age.
[149:06.70]I don't know how old all you guys are.
[149:10.44]But especially when you're... I wouldn't want to go back and, like, do it all again.
[149:14.20]Oh, but you could go back and you could change everything and do it so differently.
[149:17.82]But I've ended up where I am right now, and I'm the person I am right now because of the way that I already did it.
[149:22.02]You know what I mean?
[149:25.94]Like, what if I went back and I, like, changed something?
[149:28.00]Would I have ever done half the stuff that I'm doing?
[149:31.89]You don't know.
[149:37.15]18, 24, 18.
[149:37.43]That's what I expected.
[149:40.23]Sounded like the late high school, early college.
[149:45.93]20, like the median, something like 20.
[149:47.47]I can see that, yeah.
[149:51.49]28 with a fail, a facepalm?
[149:53.46]Dude, don't... I'm 30, man.
[149:57.98]It's not old.
[150:00.32]The world has changed.
[150:04.02]30 is the new 25.
[150:07.06]In my opinion.
[150:10.70]This room sucks.
[150:15.17]Hurry up, get over here.
[150:17.39]Get that bat.
[150:27.78]How the fuck are you 30?
[150:30.82]Hey, I wake up and ask myself that question a lot.
[150:33.72]It just happened.
[150:36.14]I graduated college and then I turned 30.
[150:38.86]What was that?
[150:41.66]It was a rock back here?
[150:43.60]Which room was the rock in?
[150:49.67]There it is.
[150:59.93]No, I can't do it there.
[151:00.85]Wait, hold on.
[151:02.49]Could it be right here?
[151:05.97]Nope.
[151:11.44]Time seriously flies.
[151:12.36]Don't play MMOs.
[151:14.54]I played World of Warcraft for a long time.
[151:17.88]That took a lot of my time.
[151:22.97]I played that game for years.
[151:31.36]Yes, the more Jerma wrestling, the more wrestling's on the way.
[151:36.52]Don't worry.
[151:37.02]I'm... I'm trying as hard as I possibly can.
[151:44.42]To be able to make this next one.
[151:48.60]There it is being worked on.
[151:52.32]Fuck.
[151:53.78]Where's my tear?
[151:54.64]It's like all over the corner.
[151:55.48]Oh, for the love of all that is sacred.
[152:07.93]I'm about to just Krampus this son of a bitch.
[152:10.53]Here we go.
[152:18.94]Find a fancy 11.
[152:27.35]Will he be opening up subs and donations soon?
[152:31.19]Uh, no.
[152:33.95]No.
[152:35.55]Subs?
[152:37.53]Yes.
[152:38.37]But donations, no.
[152:46.08]I'll go down to eight.
[152:51.04]Damn it.
[152:51.62]Why have both of these had to have bombs like that in them?
[152:59.86]I mean, if at some point I decide to do donations, I don't know.
[153:05.10]It's one of those things that I don't think I'm ever going to do it.
[153:09.78]What did that just do to me?
[153:11.76]Oh, not bad.
[153:20.25]Will your TF2 server ever come back?
[153:22.87]No, I don't think so.
[153:25.17]I don't think so.
[153:28.65]To be completely and totally honest, it was kind of just a money sink that I had, I had to just sort of get rid of.
[153:34.56]And I didn't have like very many good, like, I had one good admin and he was really reliable and he was always around.
[153:45.81]But I, I don't know.
[153:47.83]I don't feel like I need to have one.
[153:51.98]I had it for a while.
[153:52.72]It was a great... I made a ton of videos on that server.
[153:56.64]Some of you guys might have even been in those videos where I did, like, the weird, like, event type stuff.
[154:02.29]Did I forget to get that?
[154:03.49]I did.
[154:04.79]Like, two floors ago I didn't get that.
[154:06.41]I need to remember that one.
[154:26.29]Let's go back this way.
[154:29.67]Do I still enjoy TF2 after all these years?
[154:32.63]I mean, I was just playing it.
[154:35.24]The core game of Team Fortress 2 is... Does that do anything to this?
[154:41.58]It does.
[154:44.63]That makes this arguably worse.
[154:46.25]Because it stutters.
[154:49.78]The core game of TF2 will always be, like, one of the best games I've ever played.
[154:55.38]But.
[154:56.70]But.
[154:56.90]There's always a but.
[154:59.74]You... There's only so much you can say or do about anything.
[155:06.36]If you guys are wondering why I, like, haven't really been making TF2 videos, it's not because I don't like the game.
[155:13.34]It's because I want something to say.
[155:15.46]I want to, like, do something in those videos.
[155:19.76]And lately it's been like, there's not really a whole lot I can say or do.
[155:25.98]Hold on.
[155:30.24]I don't want to die here.
[155:33.81]Go over there, you slow-ass ball.
[155:38.99]Now that doesn't mean... That doesn't mean I don't like the game.
[155:42.17]I forget what the Joker does.
[155:44.59]We're just going to use it.
[155:45.18]Wonderful.
[155:46.78]Wonderful.
[155:51.66]I don't even want to get the key.
[155:53.20]I'd rather just go in.
[155:57.52]Oh, you can drop the trinket?
[155:58.46]What is it?
[155:59.10]What button is it?
[156:06.17]It's not that.
[156:19.17]Hold control?
[156:19.87]I don't know what it is on gamepad.
[156:24.31]Is it control?
[156:25.07]I don't think I have it set up for this.
[156:30.68]Does anyone know what it is on a gamepad?
[156:32.34]Is it even bound to anything on a gamepad?
[156:37.32]Of course!
[156:37.88]Of course I hit the button that I'm going to need right now.
[156:48.37]There it is.
[156:49.81]It's right-triggered.
[156:59.04]Your brain just leaked.
[157:03.62]Are you a fan of Bernie Sanders?
[157:06.34]I'm just going to say it.
[157:09.19]I don't like talking politics.
[157:13.23]I don't know enough about politics to really want to get into a discussion about it.
[157:19.39]But if you want to know, if you'd like to know, if you need to know where I... Where am I?
[157:24.79]Are you chaotic neutral?
[157:26.23]Are you neutral lawful?
[157:27.62]Are you lawful good?
[157:29.93]I'm right in the middle.
[157:33.39]There are... I'm as in the middle as you probably could be.
[157:40.21]But let's go.
[157:43.53]Any more hearts?
[157:44.03]Oh yeah, I missed one.
[157:46.97]But I don't like talking even with my friends.
[157:49.59]It's just like everyone has their opinions on things and you... You just don't want to get into like fights and debates with people about it.
[157:56.96]Because that's how it always happens.
[157:57.98]Where am I going?
[158:05.36]I don't know, like Benjamin Franklin once said.
[158:07.66]The great Benjamin Franklin.
[158:09.92]Oh, it's in a secret room, that's why.
[158:12.56]The great Benjamin Franklin once... What the f... I'm just gonna go.
[158:20.11]I'm gonna open this door, though.
[158:29.88]Donate the rest.
[158:31.14]The great Benjamin Franklin once said...
[158:34.20]Pair all things in moderation.
[158:38.80]If you're too extreme with anything, you're not following Benjamin Franklin, the greatest president of the United States.
[158:49.92]Even though he wasn't a president, he still felt like one.
[158:54.30]And he's on the 100.
[158:54.94]Andrew Jackson's on the 20.
[159:00.74]Abraham Lincoln's on the 5.
[159:02.89]Benjamin Franklin is on the 100.
[159:06.19]He's on the 100.
[159:10.19]Do we really have to have this discussion?
[159:14.39]Is George Washington on the 100?
[159:18.87]I rest my case.
[159:25.01]There's probably things I can do, but do I care?
[159:33.95]Give me that heart.
[159:38.38]Do I follow any sports?
[159:40.12]Not really.
[159:41.40]I used to follow the Red Sox religiously.
[159:47.00]The Red Sox were, like, my life.
[159:49.88]Especially, it was so awesome.
[159:52.67]That 2004 and 2007 World Series, I got to see both of them like, well, not live, but watching that team win the World Series in 2004 was awesome.
[160:05.29]They hadn't won it in like 90 years or like 86 years or something crazy.
[160:12.35]And I was in my dorm room.
[160:16.49]Oh no, wait, where was I?
[160:18.19]When was that, 2004?
[160:21.41]Was I in college in 2004?
[160:24.37]I was, right?
[160:25.85]No.
[160:27.83]No, I think I just barely was a freshman in college.
[160:30.91]Yeah, yeah, I definitely was in college for that.
[160:37.94]Hey, I'm 30.
[160:38.50]Sometimes you forget things.
[160:41.90]Oh god, this is going to be annoying.
[160:50.10]Get away from me.
[160:59.67]Let's see.
[161:00.09]Do you have any role models or people you look up to?
[161:04.35]Well, I mean, Benjamin Franklin has got to be like the... No.
[161:07.89]Uh-huh.
[161:09.85]Well, when I was younger, when I was in my teens, it was Jim Carrey.
[161:15.62]I loved everything about Jim Carrey.
[161:17.38]I thought he was the funniest, most awesome, amazing dude ever.
[161:29.14]But as of right now, I mean, I... I don't know.
[161:32.92]I don't really have, like, a role model anymore.
[161:41.29]Will you stream FTL?
[161:43.49]And the follow-up question is... Question.
[161:46.85]Will you stream FTL and get a girlfriend?
[161:56.15]No on the first one.
[161:57.73]Because I'm not that great at that game.
[162:05.02]And the second one.
[162:06.20]I don't know.
[162:06.56]I don't know.
[162:08.98]I don't know.
[162:11.18]Who knows?
[162:20.46]What do I want to be when I grow up?
[162:22.46]Well, I've already grown up.
[162:25.23]I wanted to be a magic wand maker.
[162:27.60]When I was in preschool, that's what I said I wanted to be.
[162:30.16]They asked all the kids what they wanted to be when they grew up.
[162:33.68]And you had the typical, ah, firefighter, doctor, magic wand maker.
[162:41.03]I wanted to, I didn't want to be a magician.
[162:42.63]I wanted to make the magic wands.
[162:46.63]What the?
[162:49.30]Why?
[162:51.29]Who cares?
[162:54.23]Nobody cares about the magic wand maker.
[162:56.24]People want to see the magician.
[163:10.43]Magic wand maker.
[163:12.61]I bet you the audience probably all laughed.
[163:15.13]Oh my god, this game is fucked.
[163:18.79]My little Timmy wants to be an astronaut.
[163:21.17]My little Jacob wants to be a policeman.
[163:24.51]And your little shit child wants to be a magical wand maker.
[163:29.77]It's imagination, alright?
[163:32.69]Imagination is really important.
[163:34.31]Don't ever lose it.
[163:39.87]Doesn't matter how old you get.
[163:43.03]Don't ever lose your imagination.
[163:56.79]Where do you see yourself when you're 30?
[163:59.59]Well, sitting right here right now doing this, because that's where I currently am at 30.
[164:04.69]What does this thing mean?
[164:05.61]I don't think I've ever seen that before.
[164:13.58]What is this?
[164:16.36]Oh, okay.
[164:17.10]It's a wasted bomb.
[164:27.35]No one cares about the guy that makes the bland stuff in Lucky Charms.
[164:34.29]Fuck Lucky Charms.
[164:36.68]Lucky Charms is only good till you get to the end of the marshmallows and then you don't want to eat it anymore.
[164:40.62]You're just eating soggy bread.
[164:59.57]When I was in first grade, I was asked what my favorite book was, and I said Harry Potter because it's real.
[165:07.40]Hey, like, that's... That's awesome.
[165:12.82]Don't be ashamed of that.
[165:15.48]I thought Santa Claus was real until 12 months ago.
[165:17.95]Santa Claus is real.
[165:25.53]That's what you guys don't understand.
[165:32.42]Give me something good.
[165:38.30]I don't want just a bomb.
[165:39.28]Give me something good.
[165:42.84]Dog food.
[165:43.64]Yes.
[165:51.33]Give me more keys.
[165:53.27]Take them.
[165:53.49]I'll go down to two keys.
[166:02.43]Ah, fuck.
[166:07.92]Oh, well.
[166:11.30]You get out of here, too, just because, you know, you gotta get rid of all of them.
[166:16.04]Favorite Christmas movie?
[166:23.55]Jingle all the way?
[166:24.53]I'm sorry, that's the answer.
[166:32.26]No, no, it's a Muppet Christmas Carol.
[166:33.86]What?
[166:35.22]Jingle all the way!
[166:36.22]It's a Muppet Christmas Carol.
[166:44.68]That movie's fucking stupid.
[166:53.35]Home Alone is also extremely good.
[166:55.41]That's the one you can't forget.
[166:57.89]Muppet Christmas Carol, Home Alone, or Jingle All the Way.
[167:02.97]I don't even like... Why did I say Jingle All the Way?
[167:08.74]I don't like that movie.
[167:11.20]There was no reason for me to say Jingle All the Way.
[167:13.30]I just said it.
[167:16.20]Jingle All the Way.
[167:17.48]Because I can't think of my favorite movies.
[167:30.67]Just donate it.
[167:31.41]I don't care.
[167:36.22]Was that me in the Pac-Man suit?
[167:37.34]Yes, it was.
[167:42.15]Yes, it was.
[167:54.71]Favorite album?
[167:56.90]Probably Demon Days by the Gorillaz.
[167:59.76]Gorillaz are like the only band I like to listen to.
[168:08.60]There we go.
[168:16.46]I'll go in here right now.
[168:25.03]Oh, a head!
[168:27.07]Cool!
[168:30.27]Oh, Otto.
[168:32.65]My dog is snoring.
[168:47.19]Remember when I said I was gonna stream for 30 minutes a half an hour ago?
[168:51.44]Well, I'm just here, man.
[168:52.68]I'm just here, chillin'.
[169:01.49]If I was an action figure, what accessories would I come with?
[169:06.93]I don't need any fucking gimmicks.
[169:08.75]It would just be me.
[169:11.77]Nude.
[169:13.26]In the box.
[169:18.13]Think I need, like, a gimmick?
[169:20.11]Accessories?
[169:31.42]Took me a whole week to listen to all the music on my computer.
[169:35.93]I know, like, you know, I kind of envy... Hypo, I envy people like you.
[169:40.79]I wish I cared a lot about music.
[169:44.88]Because it's so... Music is something you can just kind of turn on and care about it and listen to it.
[169:49.56]No, that was a great song.
[169:51.02]That's a great song out of my 5,000 song collection.
[169:56.47]I don't have that.
[169:58.99]I like put on Plastic Beach for 20 minutes.
[170:02.57]And then I'm done.
[170:11.96]But I wish I cared more about music.
[170:19.36]Oh, hey.
[170:29.83]If you were a giant sick, how long would you be?
[170:34.41]I'm assuming that you're trying to say stick.
[170:41.20]I don't know.
[170:43.10]A yardstick?
[170:45.28]That'd be like a yardstick?
[170:46.74]I don't know.
[170:52.84]What did I study in college?
[170:53.74]Communication.
[170:57.77]Film, TV, radio.
[170:58.75]I don't know why I was walking towards that guy.
[171:20.92]Wow, you learned how to talk in college?
[171:22.56]No, I learned how to... Well, I mean, learn is pretty subjective.
[171:30.74]I was shown how, like, radio life is, and going to studios, and working on demo reels, and how to use editing programs, and, like, shots and stuff like that, and media, marketing, and relation, public relations.
[171:47.59]It was that stuff.
[171:51.38]whole thing.
[171:58.41]But, the thing I- when I was in college, what I wanted to do... Oh, fuck.
[172:06.01]Damn it.
[172:08.84]I wanted to do, like, voice work.
[172:11.36]Voice acting.
[172:12.68]Acting in general.
[172:15.62]After being a magic wand maker, I wanted to, uh, I wanted to be, like, an actor.
[172:32.10]Where did I meet Star?
[172:33.90]Shootmania tournament.
[172:36.26]That's like the first time we ever saw each other in real life.
[172:41.78]I think like we needed another person for the Shootmania team and him and I just barely kind of started talking, like just barely.
[172:49.60]And I was like, oh, I know the perfect guy for the Shootmania team.
[172:52.52]He's like, we could go to like Quake style games and TF2 and...
[172:56.68]Oh, his name's- his name's Star!
[172:58.40]How did I get- of course- Oh my god, you fucker!
[173:04.39]Oh my goodness.
[173:07.63]Crap.
[173:07.97]So yeah, and uh, it was me, Orb, MLC Stealth, and Star.
[173:17.92]And I think it was Orb couldn't play, because it was a US-only tournament.
[173:22.84]You couldn't be from anywhere else around the world or something.
[173:26.83]So Orb was like, oh shit, I can't play in this tournament.
[173:31.37]And originally I think we were going to get Shibby was going to fill, but then it was like Star, and I think Shibby, it could be either one of them was who it was going to be.
[173:39.34]But Star ended up filling that spot, and him and MLC Stealth, well MLC Stealth just carried that entire time we played.
[173:46.52]That was so cool.
[173:48.24]That will go down as one of my favorite things, like, in, like, my gaming quote, how long I've been playing games.
[173:54.00]Was, like, winning that tournament, like, being on that team, and, like, being able to go to E3.
[174:00.03]Was, like, I just, I had to do that.
[174:02.41]I was gonna get hit a thousand times.
[174:17.26]You realize you have an entire two-hour stream posted where you dual-com with Star.
[174:21.62]Yeah, but I mean, we weren't like, we weren't like friends and we didn't really hang out.
[174:27.12]I thought the question was like, when did I like meet and like start hanging out with Star?
[174:30.28]Like, we talked.
[174:33.55]Not a whole lot, like it was sometimes we would talk, but it was really that like shoot mania tournament is when we started to become like real friends.
[174:42.75]Everything before that was kind of like, I kind of know you a little bit.
[174:46.37]I don't really know you at all, but, you know, hi.
[174:51.98]That was when our friendship started.
[174:53.34]Is he locked in?
[175:11.87]Any regrets?
[175:14.25]Everybody has regrets.
[175:19.67]Not really, but, I mean, like... Yeah, I, like, shouldn't have eaten that taco in college when I was, like, had, like, colitis.
[175:28.52]Yeah, that's a pretty... that's a regret.
[175:37.11]Let's just go.
[175:39.47]Ah, tinted rock.
[175:40.41]Shit.
[175:56.86]How does it feel to be a washed up gamer?
[175:58.58]Hey, I didn't make the washed up gamer, washed up YouTuber video.
[176:07.31]Washed up.
[176:09.31]I can't see my health.
[176:12.27]I just gotta, look at, I'm a washed up gamer.
[176:15.37]I just got hit like three times in this room.
[176:17.40]I accept that terminology now.
[176:23.19]Can anything- can I get another pill besides puberty?
[176:26.01]That'd be fantastic.
[176:34.22]You forced Star to make that- no I didn't!
[176:38.68]We had a conversation... about... how funny it would be... if in two months... his, like, next video is like another mod video.
[176:54.11]And then the idea spiraled out, and he started talking about, like, oh, yeah, what if I do this, and then we can do that?
[176:59.71]Well, not we, him.
[177:02.48]Here's something you guys need to realize, right?
[177:05.36]A lot of the videos that Star or I make, I would say, like, half the time, I gotta, like, focus here.
[177:40.64]Okay, that sucked.
[177:43.06]A lot of our videos stem from us talking in a call.
[177:49.88]About just random dumb shit.
[177:54.22]And sometimes it's like, that'd be really funny if you did that.
[177:59.34]And then one of us does it, and we go, oh wow, that's funny.
[178:03.99]And we think maybe some of you guys think it's funny too, or maybe interesting or whatever.
[178:11.29]oh no no no no no no no I don't want that I do not want that at all I don't even know how much health I have probably like none I need hearts bad nice lad I honestly thought the brain was the ball

[179:50.46]What are you, crazy?
[179:54.06]Devil deal.
[180:01.93]Well, I mean, it's better than what I had.
[180:05.15]Which was nothing.
[180:08.17]Please have this be a room with hearts in it.
[180:16.35]I think I'm willing to... Wait a minute, what pill is that?
[180:19.51]I don't know.
[180:23.27]I'm scared.
[180:25.68]I'm scared to go get that pill.
[180:27.08]I don't know what it is.
[180:28.90]And I might walk into the spikes because I'm an idiot.
[180:36.53]Was that a full health pill?
[180:44.47]Do you enjoy making skits over gaming videos?
[180:46.23]Yes.
[180:48.15]Yes.
[180:56.28]Really didn't want to do that, but I may not have even made it into this room.
[181:07.19]What?
[181:07.67]Oh my goodness.
[181:08.97]Come on, dude.
[181:16.59]I'm screwed.
[181:18.46]Whatever, cross your fingers.
[181:49.19]I wish this would hit faster.
[181:56.87]Shit.
[182:01.75]I'm in trouble.
[182:03.15]I'm in trouble.
[182:04.83]I'm in big trouble.
[182:07.41]I'm in big trouble.
[182:14.16]I did it.
[182:16.52]But I don't... It's gonna be hard to do this.
[182:22.01]How much health?
[182:23.67]Two hearts.
[182:27.91]This might be a GG over here.
[182:35.76]Oh no, I didn't even realize she was here.
[182:51.53]It's not doing enough damage, I'm not doing enough damage!
[182:56.21]If you get to the cathedral and you're not, like, legit melting people... It's gonna be tough.
[183:05.14]Not these guys again.
[183:06.00]Whoa!
[183:13.20]See you later guys, I'm done.
[183:14.32]I'm dead.
[183:16.06]I don't know how I'm... See you later.
[183:28.36]I didn't have faith in that one.
[183:30.52]I don't like using that technique, the Ludovico technique thing.
[183:47.43]Favorite TV shows?
[183:49.34]You could say Breaking Bad.
[183:50.86]That's everybody's favorite TV show.
[183:57.01]No.
[183:57.73]Dr. Stiebrel.
[184:00.25]Check it out with Stiebrel.
[184:10.96]It could be the best show ever.
[184:20.22]Never seen Br- Rick and Morty is good too.
[184:23.16]It's hard to say what your favorite TV show is because- oops.
[184:28.39]There's a lot of good shows right now that are currently around that are the last five years or so, the last couple years.
[184:44.28]I hate TV and I like Breaking Bad.
[184:45.54]It's pretty good.
[184:47.17]It's pretty good.
[185:01.92]Late night snack recommendations, Dr. Oetker's Pizza.
[185:04.68]That's it.
[185:09.38]Oh, by the way, can we just address this?
[185:11.17]I've talked about it a bunch.
[185:12.89]I've talked about, like, Dr. Oetker's Pizza being the best frozen pizza ever.
[185:17.43]How many of you guys have actually eaten it since I talked about it?
[185:20.93]It has to be at least a couple of you had to have been like, I'll try it.
[185:24.68]What'd you think?
[185:25.04]Good?
[185:27.16]Good?
[185:30.19]I want to know what other people have to say about it.
[185:44.33]Good.
[185:44.65]Yep.
[185:45.17]Yes.
[185:46.47]No idea what it is.
[185:49.51]Never heard of it.
[185:50.13]Me.
[185:52.07]It's really good.
[186:06.40]This is good, but I need that charge to be faster.
[186:16.07]Dr. Rook.
[186:19.13]Am I going to try to make it to the next tip of the hats live?
[186:21.07]Yes.
[186:22.67]It was just not possible this year, unfortunately.
[186:28.24]Me and Star just moved.
[186:32.37]There were people working in my house.
[186:35.74]Like, literally the night before that Tip of the Hat started.
[186:40.16]And even, like, the morning of Tip of the Hats, there was, like... Shit, I can't get that.
[186:45.76]There were people working in my house.
[186:49.85]And, like, I came in late to Tip of the Hats.
[186:52.31]I missed, like, the first event that they did.
[186:54.43]I showed up at, like, two or three or something.
[187:09.14]But yeah, I definitely wanted to go.
[187:11.48]It was just a bad time, personally, to be able to go.
[187:22.35]Whoa, that just scared me.
[187:24.65]That scared the shit out of me when he just did that.
[187:37.02]What?
[187:41.45]What a... What a one heart.
[187:49.75]Oh, that was... The shuffle.
[187:56.69]Crap.
[188:04.52]The name of the pizza?
[188:05.08]It's Dr. Oetkers.
[188:07.48]O-E-T-K-E-R-S, I believe.
[188:09.68]Oetker.
[188:28.63]Thank god I got that.
[188:29.61]Don't touch that yet.
[188:39.49]Give me that key and then I'm just... There we go.
[188:41.48]Pfft.
[188:52.96]Wasn't close enough?
[189:00.68]Favorite water bottle brand?
[189:04.82]Uh... Whatever one is the cheapest at the supermarket.
[189:10.49]Fuck.
[189:17.19]I just got... I just clipped on that wall.
[189:19.13]That shouldn't have happened.
[189:21.53]I can't let this run go to shit.
[189:22.89]I have Monstro.
[189:24.51]That would be a shame if I let this go to shit.
[189:27.73]Do not let this go to shit.
[189:40.98]Do I like Dr. Pepper?
[189:41.88]Yes.
[189:43.00]Although I don't really drink it that often anymore.
[189:45.26]I've gotten shy away from soda recently.
[189:50.66]The last couple of years, a year or so.
[189:57.04]What does he do?
[189:58.18]Doesn't he do something specific if he gets hit or something?
[190:16.31]Come on, get over here.
[190:24.00]I mean, Soda can be good.
[190:25.10]Like, I don't know.
[190:29.12]I used to drink a lot of soda.
[190:32.28]And I still do it occasionally.
[190:33.22]I'm at like a restaurant or something, I'll get like a Coke.
[190:37.22]Out of the glass, you know, you drink it out of the glass.
[190:39.17]It's just like, oh, I'm drinking a Coke out of the glass.
[190:42.11]Something about a Coke out of the glass at a restaurant is just good.
[190:45.21]Yay.
[191:01.25]Shoots two different tiers each time, the same as two of your... So if I have familiars, it'll do it?
[191:14.17]Okay, I don't care about the secret room.
[191:29.81]Hey, thank goodness!
[191:33.16]And a Devil Room.
[191:40.60]Huh.
[191:43.28]Well, I could... This could be real interesting.
[191:47.59]If I get Baby Brimstone... We could have a lot of, uh... A lot of fun.
[191:54.51]But I would also be down to one heart.
[192:02.01]Is it worth?
[192:02.37]Is it worth doing it?
[192:13.00]Yeah, I know, I gotta get the Eternal Heart too.
[192:14.60]Uh, I could, I could, I could do this, but I would have no hearts.
[192:41.74]I'm gonna die.
[192:49.19]Okay.
[192:50.05]Let's go for it.
[192:53.87]Let's do it.
[193:02.21]How come he didn't do it?
[193:04.84]Why is he not doing it?
[193:10.74]Did I just get fucking... What?
[193:16.40]He's not doing anything!
[193:17.36]I just... I... How come he's not shooting anything?
[193:37.79]Oh, he's doing flies.
[193:39.05]That's not... I didn't want... I wanted him to shoot out the fucking double brimstone.
[193:53.45]Where is it?
[193:53.81]It's down here.
[193:54.49]Alright, place your bets.
[193:59.32]Am I gonna get hit before I can, uh, use this in this room?
[194:05.38]I'm gonna get hit five times.
[194:15.29]Oh, he doesn't.
[194:15.81]He doesn't copy Brimstone.
[194:20.27]Okay.
[194:27.54]Well, you just instantly insta-died.
[194:29.32]I forget what Ansu's does.
[194:36.58]I feel like I shouldn't take that.
[194:38.42]Because doesn't that make everything a... That bad, bloody chest?
[194:51.80]You guys are kind of getting in the way.
[195:00.21]Shit, attack of the flies!
[195:12.95]That doesn't do anything, does it?
[195:17.82]Look at how long that is now.
[195:29.23]Does that do... No, there's no synergy there, I don't think.
[195:37.17]Damn it.
[195:38.85]I thought that was going to be synergizing.
[195:45.58]Is it more?
[195:46.08]Maybe it is.
[195:49.32]Maybe it is.
[195:56.98]I could do the paw again if I really wanted to.
[196:01.50]How much of this game have I played?
[196:02.56]Like, maybe 70 or 75 hours?
[196:06.08]The problem with Isaac, though, is... If you don't... I... I'd never played... All my time in Isaac was when it first came out.
[196:15.94]So it's been literally up until, like, a couple weeks ago or so.
[196:19.05]It's been, like, probably like a year since I played it.
[196:22.49]So I just forget everything that's in the game.
[196:24.97]And even still, I was one of those wiki people.
[196:27.53]I needed to use the wiki because I just didn't know everything.
[196:29.73]I always forgot what stuff did.
[196:41.48]Come on, that was blinking.
[196:42.46]I did it.
[196:58.09]Nothing at 450.
[196:58.57]Yeah, at least the flies will kill things while I'm charging.
[197:03.97]That is correct.
[197:16.82]Those flies really are doing work.
[197:26.35]Let's just go.
[197:27.51]Oh, no, no, no, wait, wait, wait.
[197:38.13]Oh, shit.
[197:39.11]Two of you.
[197:52.75]Getting all my hearts back, that's a good thing.
[198:03.22]If I find the broken remote with the paw, take it.
[198:05.44]Infinite teleports.
[198:08.20]Could go down and explore, but whatever.
[198:25.08]Will you hit him?
[198:28.37]Oh my god, thank you.
[198:30.33]Thank you, thank you, thank you, thank you.
[198:34.03]Nothing in this room.
[198:45.99]How's Otto doing?
[198:48.17]Fantastic, he's right behind me.
[198:50.78]Sleep him.
[198:52.40]Being a good boy.
[198:53.22]He just heard me say his name so he looked up over here.
[198:57.24]He's a good dog.
[198:59.34]He's my little buddy.
[199:14.50]This is really, really good though.
[199:17.57]The only bad part about this is, besides the flies, it takes me forever to... It takes me forever to do a ton of damage.
[199:25.74]Gotta make sure I'm hitting things.
[199:30.04]This is pretty sweet.
[199:33.11]Oh ho ho ho ho!
[199:35.67]Oh boy!
[199:36.39]Oh boy!
[199:38.45]Would you look at that!
[199:42.45]Now we're talking!
[199:51.23]Shit's gonna really start to hit the fan if I get the familiar upgrade.
[200:27.36]I did I did you see I just did that I actually just did that I waited so long and everything even more health oh boy boy boy hmm
[200:53.84]I could do the paw again and then take the book.
[201:08.23]What do you think, guys?
[201:11.21]What do you think?
[201:22.69]Use the paw, grab the book, and get the cat.
[201:39.85]Get the cat.
[201:40.31]You have nothing to lose.
[201:41.59]I don't know if I want to get the cat.
[201:45.69]We're at least getting the book of Belial.
[201:48.27]Because it's just outrageous.
[201:56.38]Yeah, I hate that item.
[201:59.55]I really don't like the cat item.
[202:02.27]We're going to go on our merry way.
[202:03.75]I'll just take the book.
[202:10.40]Except I still need to go into... Oh, I didn't miss the item room.
[202:17.58]Yeah, I don't care.
[202:18.22]We're just going to go.
[202:20.42]Hey, guess what?
[202:21.58]Bet you I get hit by this shit again.
[202:25.09]Nope.
[202:34.39]Take the cat take the cat fine.
[202:37.05]I'll take the cat you want me to take the cat took the cat Now I now I got nine lives and it's gonna I'm gonna get too confident and I'm gonna die nine times Oh The cat gives you a heart Whoops
[203:02.73]What a washed out... What a wa... What a washed up video game player.
[203:17.27]Everyone's saying to go back to the... I want the book of... I want the book.
[203:21.63]Do you know how much damage I want to be doing?
[203:25.17]I don't care about guppy.
[203:28.81]See, I want to be able to go like this.
[203:31.53]See, now I go...
[203:35.79]Oh, what a shit room.
[203:50.31]What a shit room that was.
[204:06.57]If this was original Isaac.
[204:08.39]Yeah, maybe I'm putting two together.
[204:19.04]Watch out, everybody!
[204:20.70]Don't get blown up.
[204:32.10]Fill up your mouth.
[204:33.06]Let's go.
[204:44.23]range up I'll take it study to find some stuff I don't know the chance like the chances of me getting more guppy I mean what is the actual chances here
[205:02.56]If it happens, it happens, you know?
[205:04.56]But, I don't know.
[205:06.04]I never want to rely... You can never really lie on something dropping in this game.
[205:11.03]Because everything's just random.
[205:15.17]Everything's just randomized.
[205:16.17]It's a randomized dungeon.
[205:31.39]Oh, god damn it.
[205:34.53]Come on.
[205:36.87]I fucking hate these things.
[205:40.29]Especially when they're this close.
[205:50.86]Spider box.
[205:55.24]Nah, not that.
[205:56.14]Not as good as Book of Belial.
[206:01.67]I could go in the coin shop, but I... I'm gonna scream.
[206:13.12]I'm gonna just scream at the top of my lungs.
[206:25.12]Gonna fucking start screaming.
[206:44.42]Okay, so I have one heart, right?
[206:46.22]Or two hearts.
[206:49.22]Shit.
[207:01.83]It's pretty handy.
[207:08.71]Now I get two hearts.
[207:11.85]I really have just been kind of skipping the secret rooms, unfortunately.
[207:19.15]But we're just trying to go.
[207:20.01]You know, we're just going.
[207:31.64]You gonna give me another one of these?
[207:34.02]You gonna give me another one of these with an obstacle in the way?
[207:37.54]I have to go around that.
[207:40.35]You know what I mean?
[207:40.81]I have to go around that.
[207:42.95]How annoying.
[207:52.48]Come on!
[207:54.66]If I go, it's gonna... Please, I have to go back.
[208:00.31]Oh, I hate those rums.
[208:02.79]With a passion.
[208:08.15]Here we go, let's go again.
[208:29.96]He's jumping all over the place.
[208:30.94]Can you stop moving, dude?
[208:31.87]I still have some hearts.
[208:35.73]Okay.
[208:44.86]Mmm, okay.
[208:49.46]What's your favorite flavor of ice cream?
[208:52.18]Pretty much just standard chocolate.
[208:55.02]If it's not standard chocolate, then it's what I said earlier.
[208:57.36]Like the fudge brownie ice cream from Ben & Jerry's.
[209:00.74]It's crazy.
[209:01.38]Actually, I don't even remember the name of it.
[209:03.70]It's like double fudge, ultra fudge brownie guy mode.
[209:08.00]I don't know.
[209:08.32]It's got a weird name.
[209:09.96]All Ben & Jerry's ice cream has weird screwy-louy names.
[209:15.73]Like Chippendales Rescue Ranger Raspberry Lime Ricky.
[209:21.43]Okay.
[209:22.41]Could just call it Raspberry Ice Cream.
[209:38.40]Where's the last one?
[209:39.06]There you are.
[209:42.74]Fish food?
[209:43.20]Yeah, fish food's good.
[209:43.80]That's the one with the marshmallow, right?
[209:47.00]With the chocolate pieces.
[209:50.62]Half-baked is good.
[209:52.67]Almost all of the Ben & Jerry's ice cream is good.
[209:54.45]Where is he?
[210:13.03]Does that do anything?
[210:13.69]I wonder if that pulses.
[210:19.10]It does.
[210:20.34]It does.
[210:22.40]That's neat.
[210:29.63]That's real neat.
[210:42.47]All of them just hit that guy in the face?
[210:52.54]I'm trying just to make one of them hit him.
[211:03.73]Get it back.
[211:23.22]Mmm, shoot.
[211:32.16]I got money to spend.
[211:32.98]We're going in here.
[211:33.66]Can I see the chat?
[211:36.49]Of course I can.
[211:42.23]Of course I can see the chat.
[212:01.52]A Blackheart.
[212:02.04]I'm getting so many HP ups.
[212:10.84]This game really wants me to stay alive with the current build that I have.
[212:17.29]I'll just take that for this room and then I'm gonna throw it away.
[212:29.12]I just want to say thank you for the numerous hilarious videos that brighten my life.
[212:34.28]You're welcome, dude.
[212:36.46]Thanks for even caring about them in the first place.
[212:40.57]I should be thanking you.
[212:49.15]There it is.
[212:50.63]There's the item.
[212:54.55]There it is.
[212:58.24]That's what we like to call a good game.
[213:04.12]Look at this troop I got now.
[213:09.97]Nice.
[213:11.49]Oh wow, that's amazing.
[213:16.19]Well, I'm gonna just take this for fun.
[213:21.25]Whatever.
[213:23.71]Whatever.
[213:28.18]Alright, let's go ahead and win this one.
[213:31.36]If you don't know what that does, that makes all of my familiars do more damage.
[213:34.65]They're just even better.
[213:36.19]They grow stronger and they get more powerful.
[213:39.37]For what I'm doing right now, this is unbelievable.
[213:48.27]I guess I could start hurting.
[213:50.71]No, I don't even... Luck up.
[213:54.03]Alright.
[213:55.31]I just don't even care.
[213:58.18]I could just like farm all this, but I have plenty of items.
[214:02.52]I have plenty of bombs, plenty of keys.
[214:06.16]I could get the blood bag or something, but you know, who really cares?
[214:13.85]Do I have donations set up?
[214:15.09]No, I answered this before, I'll answer it again.
[214:17.05]I'm not doing donations.
[214:22.35]At least for the foreseeable future.
[214:32.78]Damn, that did a lot.
[214:45.23]See you later, mama.
[214:54.35]Okay, did I win?
[214:55.91]I think I won.
[214:58.26]Did I win?
[214:59.70]Guys, I won.
[215:01.02]I did it.
[215:02.78]I did it, guys.
[215:03.62]I did it.
[215:09.26]What the fuck?
[215:18.36]I've won the video game.
[215:20.80]I've won the video game.
[215:29.27]Look at me!
[215:34.71]If I lose this game... I'm gonna uninstall Isaac.
[215:46.02]If I don't at least beat, like, Mum's heart... Something's wrong.
[215:56.99]Now let's take the book.
[216:05.64]Okay.
[216:06.44]I'm not going to take that.
[216:07.30]That's too much.
[216:10.36]Look at my little cat.
[216:15.78]Alright.
[216:16.53]Oh, that was the end.
[216:21.21]It's almost physically impossible for me not to at least get to Isaac.
[216:24.75]Right?
[216:27.03]If you don't understand what happened, if you pick up... It's three items in the guppy line, if you will.
[216:35.31]You turn into Guppy the cat and you just steamroll every single room.
[216:42.73]Pretty much.
[216:49.42]Alright, let's go.
[216:56.72]Let's see, let's see what Guppy can do.
[217:00.11]Let's move.
[217:03.37]Whoops.
[217:04.51]Uninstall hype.
[217:08.11]Uninstall hype, guys.
[217:10.29]I just took that damage that I should not have taken.
[217:11.91]Uninstall hype.
[217:13.54]Look at all these flies.
[217:18.98]There's so many of them.
[217:19.82]I think this is actually only the second time I've ever had Guppy.
[217:28.09]Come and get me.
[217:33.57]Now we just blow through the whole game.
[217:37.09]I'm just going through every room.
[217:38.23]I don't even care.
[217:38.67]We're not even stopping.
[217:40.03]I'm only going to stop to charge before I go in a room.
[217:44.13]Okay, now hold on.
[217:44.61]We're going to stop here.
[217:47.57]Um.
[217:48.87]Range up.
[217:49.65]Yes.
[217:52.98]Paraket.
[217:53.56]The rest of those are paralysis.
[217:54.68]You can fly over objects too.
[217:55.84]God.
[217:56.66]What an unbeatable item.
[218:01.31]I'll just take them.
[218:02.41]In case I need it for some reason.
[218:05.73]Oh, thanks.
[218:06.01]Thanks for the heart.
[218:07.54]Thanks for more free stuff.
[218:14.96]Haha.
[218:15.06]Do you remember what is your real name?
[218:22.93]It's, uh, Arnold Elbertson.
[218:27.31]Uninstall.
[218:28.91]Uninstall in the game.
[218:31.58]Took another hit.
[218:33.76]I should be taking zero hits.
[218:35.26]I think I'm just getting overconfident.
[218:45.36]Oh, overconfidence, man.
[218:46.42]It's gonna be the death of me.
[218:53.99]At least I know those things will never touch me.
[218:56.63]What boss is in here that's going to insta-die?
[219:06.65]See ya.
[219:07.19]Another devil room.
[219:09.37]Oh my god.
[219:11.81]Another one, another one.
[219:15.19]I'm not even gonna be able to see.
[219:16.77]This is so many people.
[219:20.76]There's too many people on the screen.
[219:33.04]My friends!
[219:37.06]I mean, I didn't have to do that, but you kind of have to if you have this setup, don't you?
[219:41.76]Why not?
[219:42.44]Take another one.
[219:46.15]I'm not doing Brimstone.
[219:47.07]I already have this.
[219:49.13]And I already have Guppy, so I'm not taking two full hearts for no reason.
[219:55.57]I like the super spit.
[219:56.89]And then there's this, where I can go like this and fly.
[220:02.20]But there's no reason to have that.
[220:03.36]I'm going to keep the book.
[220:08.96]I'm not getting Brimstone.
[220:09.94]We want to have, like, a party.
[220:14.33]Oh, the Book of Lyle is doing that.
[220:15.99]Right, right, right.
[220:16.73]Okay, let's go.
[220:18.85]Oh, that's not Brimstone?
[220:22.05]Oh, Brimstone has the two lines in it, right?
[220:26.90]Curse of Darkness.
[220:27.80]Oh, no.
[220:29.26]Whatever will I do?
[220:31.94]Whatever will I do?
[220:32.98]I can't see, but it doesn't matter.
[220:36.10]It just doesn't matter.
[220:39.77]I have a machine gun of flies.
[220:48.16]Nothing can stop me.
[220:48.94]Just going... Oh, give me that key.
[221:06.79]The flies, they're so awesome.
[221:10.23]Remember I said what was the percentage of me actually getting guppy?
[221:13.59]And... I got it.
[221:15.27]You either get it or you don't, right?
[221:19.90]Let's hide over here too.
[221:27.00]This is such a joke.
[221:40.71]Have I played the Eternal mode in Binding of Isaac 1?
[221:43.19]No.
[221:43.35]Didn't they update it?
[221:44.57]Binding of Isaac, didn't they?
[221:45.58]The original?
[221:46.86]Didn't they add stuff to it or something?
[221:50.06]Is that what they added?
[222:04.55]And here we go.
[222:07.25]Let's do it.
[222:25.86]Melting.
[222:27.00]Melted.
[222:28.89]Jeez.
[222:30.23]That is so awesome.
[222:34.37]Although, hold on a second.
[222:35.51]Did I not... I don't think I got the Polaroid.
[222:41.82]Did I get the Polaroid in Mum?
[222:43.24]Or should I just go try to beat Satan?
[222:46.08]Or just beat Isaac?
[222:47.99]The Polaroid is for...
[222:51.27]I don't even remember.
[222:53.13]Eternal mode really isn't that fun.
[222:54.85]Just some new boss effects that happen sometimes.
[222:58.67]I did get it.
[222:59.07]Yeah, I got it.
[223:00.47]Let's go.
[223:01.73]Let's go to the cathedral.
[223:07.51]Okay.
[223:08.88]Are we uninstalling the game?
[223:10.98]We'll find out very soon.
[223:31.35]You got it, Jeremy Wormy.
[223:35.23]Jeremy Wormy.
[223:46.08]Oh, it's that guy.
[223:46.74]The reason why I got hit, I didn't realize it was one of those green guys.
[223:51.65]I wouldn't have gotten hit if I didn't know.
[224:04.89]It's weird to see the Polaroid unlock before the negative.
[224:09.53]What is the criteria for unlocking the negative?
[224:15.30]Because I don't think I have it.
[224:21.28]Can you spend your 50 Gerber bucks on that question?
[224:23.40]You sure can.
[224:25.00]But that was your question.
[224:26.63]So, there it is.
[224:28.49]Tinted Rock.
[224:29.27]I missed it, but I'll get it.
[224:30.31]I'll go get it.
[224:35.97]Can't give up a Tinted Rock at this point in the game.
[224:41.58]Satan five times.
[224:42.44]I've beaten Mega Satan, I think, two or three times.
[224:45.66]Have I just not even ca- You know what?
[224:47.36]I might have just ca- I think I just keep going to the Cathedral.
[224:52.55]Pretty sure that's what's going on.
[224:53.97]I don't, like, go fight Satan, ever.
[224:55.95]I always go to fight Isaac.
[224:58.71]Whenever I get there.
[224:59.51]I don't know how many times it's been.
[225:08.73]I hate these chump characters.
[225:22.14]Okay.
[225:23.56]Let's do it.
[225:54.28]Uninstall the game.
[225:58.15]Very good, I don't have to uninstall the game.
[226:03.67]I do not have to uninstall The Binding of Isaac.
[226:14.69]Oh my god!
[226:15.80]Dude, this... There's too many people!
[226:25.06]This is... I've never seen this many familiars.
[226:33.37]This is gonna confuse me now.
[226:36.07]Should I just get the orbit thing too?
[226:39.98]Should I just get orbit?
[226:45.26]Who cares, right?
[226:50.43]Don't pick up that planet.
[226:52.39]Do not pick up that planet.
[226:53.83]Okay, fine.
[226:54.93]We'll just lose here.
[226:56.37]I honestly might lose to... Is it Blue Baby?
[227:06.54]Because I don't remember what he does.
[227:08.22]I might just lose here.
[227:30.42]I'm not gonna lie, that technology baby is kind of freaking me out.
[227:34.35]Like I keep seeing it and I keep thinking it's an enemy of some sort.
[227:45.65]Can I hurt this fucking dude?
[227:46.73]What the fuck?
[227:57.80]Get the contact.
[228:04.07]Oh, you asshole.
[228:16.82]Even more flies.
[228:25.14]Get in my fly, brethren.
[228:44.18]Hope this is the right way.
[228:47.10]What the fuck?
[228:47.78]Oh, come on.
[228:48.66]You didn't just really do that to me, baby.
[228:52.44]Oh, fuck.
[228:55.14]What the hell?
[228:55.86]Uh-oh.
[228:59.27]Uh-oh!
[229:01.75]Uh-oh!
[229:07.79]The babies ended up screwing me over there, guys.
[229:14.18]Don't, don't, don't, don't do that.
[229:18.12]Oh my fucking god.
[229:20.38]Come on.
[229:25.82]Slow down.
[229:27.80]Slow the fuck down.
[229:30.40]Why am I getting hit by these?
[229:32.48]Why am I getting hit by these?
[229:33.70]Holy shit.
[229:40.32]Slow down.
[229:41.70]I'm too fast.
[229:42.54]I was moving too fast.
[229:48.73]I was just going too fast and I forgot that, like, I had to slow down right there.
[229:53.21]Alright, I think that's probably the right way.
[230:04.44]Not like this.
[230:05.74]Not like this.
[230:07.28]I've, I've, you know what?
[230:08.50]That, that, that room.
[230:10.72]Hey, by the way, what the fuck, dude?
[230:12.86]Why?
[230:13.50]What the fuck?
[230:14.06]I didn't even move.
[230:15.02]I died when I went in the room.
[230:16.82]I opened the door and died.
[230:20.09]Like legit, you guys saw, I didn't even move.
[230:22.01]I didn't go anywhere.
[230:23.53]Give me a break.
[230:29.06]Am I just like getting blocked out from all my dudes?
[230:33.38]I'm fucking terrified to walk right here.
[230:47.41]It wasn't this way, shit.
[230:49.27]I gotta go back through that stupid ass room.
[230:58.26]Oh my god.
[231:05.64]You gotta be kidding me.
[231:10.54]This is the room that's going to end this whole thing?
[231:14.48]This dumbass fucking room where I'm hitting the hitboxes on these things?
[231:23.00]Go in, please.
[231:29.53]Probably down, I would assume.
[231:44.74]Get him.
[231:45.10]I don't know.
[231:57.81]I really use a Spirit Heart right now.
[232:09.66]Shit.
[232:10.78]I just forgot what these guys do.
[232:20.40]Oh, damn it, they spawned those things.
[232:25.31]Oh, hey, by the way, uninstall hype was for Isaac, was for killing Isaac.
[232:30.47]Not this, you know, this has nothing to do with uninstall hype.
[232:37.12]Fuck.
[232:38.02]This is about to be game over.
[232:52.35]This room is so hard with one heart.
[232:54.49]Time to uninstall the game.
[233:13.28]No.
[233:21.00]There's so many directions where you could die.
[233:23.02]There was one heart.
[233:26.09]I could have just bombed the door.
[233:27.39]Hey, well, it was getting to Isaac and beating Isaac.
[233:34.18]I even said I don't think I was going to be able to beat this with, like, two hearts.
[233:39.00]All I needed to prove was beating Isaac.
[233:49.12]I should have used... I should have used the fucking orbit.
[233:52.30]That was the problem.
[233:56.22]Oh, you can't... you can't even bomb through rooms in the chest.
[234:01.23]Trying to... honestly, let's be like real here.
[234:04.17]Trying to beat the chest with one or two hearts is pretty much impossible as it is.
[234:12.15]What really screwed me was the fucking stupid-ass hitboxes on the red poo.
[234:20.96]Like, what the fuck was that?
[234:22.16]Like, I would walk in the door like this and die.
[234:26.18]Without even touching my controller.
[234:27.50]I would just walk in and insta-die.
[234:29.74]That happened like three times, at least.
[234:36.99]That was really, really, really annoying.
[234:47.16]Red poop hitboxes are extremely lame.
[234:49.30]Especially when there's three of them in the only area you can move as your character.
[234:54.42]I lost, like, three hearts there.
[234:58.16]Like, legit, let's be totally real here.
[235:00.53]I went like this.
[235:01.81]And died.
[235:03.85]I'm not even moving.
[235:05.59]Not touching anything.
[235:06.67]Just... That was what happened.
[235:15.05]And that brought me down to one, which if I even had more than one hit I could take, that would be great.
[235:20.37]That would have been fine.
[235:30.70]God damn it.
[235:34.47]I wanted to beat Isaac.
[235:36.03]I was just chilling.
[235:37.34]That was a very, very incredible build, but I will say it.
[235:42.20]I said it before and I'll say it again.
[235:44.10]Going into the chest with less than two or three hearts, you have a huge, huge, huge percentage that you're just going to lose.
[235:54.25]Especially those rooms with two or three of those big, horrible bosses.
[236:03.17]They're very, very hard.
[236:05.17]Especially those two.
[236:06.01]It had to be that fucking guy who spawns the turkeys that shoot in fucking four directions.
[236:22.29]I didn't forget about it.
[236:22.97]It's right here.
[236:26.57]I'm taking broom, baby.
[236:28.17]This is not even a real run.
[236:29.39]This is a fake run.
[236:33.18]I'm just venting my frustrations about the red poo hitboxes.
[236:41.46]We all saw.
[236:41.96]We all saw it.
[236:43.02]I don't have to pretend like something happened.
[236:45.58]We all saw what happened.
[236:50.04]I'm gonna call the gamer police on those guys.
[236:56.45]I'm gonna call Ed.
[236:59.41]And be like, Ed, what's going on with those hitboxes, man?
[237:05.97]I'm upset about it.
[237:07.09]And he's gonna go, okay.
[237:10.37]And then we're gonna hang up.
[237:11.47]Okay, this is not even... This is a fake run.
[237:33.73]This is an I'm pissed off run.
[237:35.17]I'm very upset right now.
[237:36.27]I couldn't be more angry.
[237:47.46]I haven't really been streaming for the second time for four hours.
[237:50.76]Really?
[237:51.02]This is a fucking fake run.
[237:58.93]Okay.
[238:06.03]Don't whistle.
[238:06.59]You know I can't whistle.
[238:07.47]You're gonna mock me like that?
[238:09.81]He's only doing that because he knows I can't do it.
[238:12.81]Ain't even fucking real.
[238:32.78]Jerm is very irritated right now.
[238:40.94]Alright, so I'm gonna uninstall Isaac, but I never said I couldn't reinstall it immediately after, right?
[238:47.84]I can, like, uninstall Isaac and then immediately reinstall it.
[238:53.58]And I can take the gamer license test again.
[238:56.84]So what?
[238:57.38]So I fail... Oh, yeah, okay, you failed your driver's ed test.
[239:02.14]You know, you can try it again in, like, another six months.
[239:05.24]You can pass it.
[239:06.15]I can get my gamer license back.
[239:09.35]I'm just gonna take the test again.
[239:24.46]Fair enough.
[239:26.58]That's a great response.
[239:32.75]Fair enough.
[240:02.08]So much stuff.
[240:06.18]So much shit just popped out of me.
[240:17.12]I knew that was gonna happen.
[240:19.32]And I did that on purpose, you guys.
[240:20.94]You think, oh, you're so dumb.
[240:22.52]You didn't know suicide can kill you.
[240:24.25]I think that was a joke.
[240:36.11]Hold on a second, I gotta get my gamer license back.
[240:40.67]I'm gonna go take my gamer test again.
[240:44.99]Hold on a second, I'm gonna take my gamer license test.
[240:53.48]I can't believe you just unlocked the scissors.
[240:59.06]Yeah, why did I not have the scissors?
[241:00.52]I have like 75 hours in this game.
[241:02.72]How do I not have the scissors?
[241:08.47]I don't know how that's possible.
[241:14.54]That was a fake run, guys.
[241:16.46]That wasn't even a real run.
[241:31.16]I need to do something to get my gamer license back.
[241:36.27]Let's see, what can I do?
[241:37.22]What can I do to prove to you guys that I can get my gamer license back?
[241:41.92]After just getting it revoked.
[241:45.24]I just like crashed into a mailbox and they took away my license.
[242:03.99]Alright, if I...
[242:10.19]Your license has been revoked Yeah, I failed the prep I like just tried to parallel park and I drove over the curb four times and I Tried to play it off like it didn't happen
[242:32.65]And the guy that was doing my driver's ed test kept on going, okay, just straighten it out.
[242:40.06]And you know, but you know exactly what he's thinking.
[242:42.70]This dude failed the test.
[242:46.38]You know, like you go over the curb and he's just like, it's okay, just straighten it out, please.
[242:52.24]And the whole time he's sitting there going, I failed.
[242:54.02]I failed it.
[242:55.27]And then you're really getting all worked up about it, so you straighten out and you back over the curb again.
[242:59.83]And then he, like, hits the brake that he has on his car.
[243:03.13]You know, like, I can, like, put the brake on whenever I want on his passenger side.
[243:07.82]And he, like, makes you get out of the car, and then he, like, does it for you.
[243:10.66]And then he's like, okay, that was alright up until that point.
[243:15.46]Yeah.
[243:18.04]Alright, let me see something here.
[243:22.24]Give me a second, guys.
[243:24.45]I think I know just the way to get my gamer license back.

[243:38.32]Just one second here.
[243:44.74]Submit a urine sample?
[243:47.72]Yeah, I'm gonna piss in a jar and you guys could test it, see if there's any gaming plasma in it.
[243:55.53]I think you guys are gonna hear this and you're gonna know how we're gonna get our gamer license back.
[244:06.33]That's right.
[244:16.60]That's right.
[244:20.74]Super Meat Boy!
