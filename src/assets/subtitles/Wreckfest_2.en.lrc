[00:33.45]It is a beautiful day outside.
[00:34.95]Got a little sun.
[00:42.77]Made a latte.
[00:48.21]It's a good day.
[00:53.14]What I have to do is.
[00:53.88]Something very important before we get started.
[00:58.62]Ask you what you can do for your country, not what your country can do for you.
[01:05.47]And you should be watching Jerma985's livestream today.
[01:09.21]He's playing a car game.
[01:11.09]There you go.
[01:13.98]There you go.
[01:29.45]Royalty free movie night.
[01:30.53]We'll do that soon.
[01:35.85]I saw this came up.
[01:38.63]Wreckfest 2 came out today.
[01:41.79]I guess it's early, like very early access.
[01:44.17]I have no idea.
[01:44.81]I played the first one, which seems to be almost 10 years ago now.
[01:51.11]I don't know how much content is in the game, but we're going to find out.
[02:04.07]Anyone ever told you you'd make a great friar from the 14th century?
[02:10.15]What did a friar do?
[02:13.65]The only time I can think of a friar, I just think of that Bugleberry look.
[02:18.94]What was their... They blessed things.
[02:35.88]They prayed and... Transcribing Bibles.
[02:44.16]You know, I... Is it kind of like a maester from Game of Thrones?
[02:57.63]Kinda.
[03:01.11]Where's the timer?
[03:01.89]I didn't put the timer up there yet.
[03:04.36]That's a that's a Monday of this coming week thing.
[03:17.57]But yeah, so today here's the plan for today.
[03:19.59]We're going to play this.
[03:23.41]For a little bit, I don't know if there's enough content in Reckfest to play this for like 5 hours.
[03:27.39]I don't.
[03:27.85]I could be wrong, but I don't think so.
[03:31.17]I also have Laundry Simulator.
[03:33.81]I saw that pop up and I was like, okay.
[03:37.35]I also have Robocop.
[03:40.57]Robocop was on sale for a shitload off.
[03:44.14]It came out a year or two ago.
[03:45.38]I never played it.
[03:47.38]And then obviously Chrono Trigger later.
[03:53.99]I have Wreckfest open right now.
[03:57.11]And it is lagging my entire computer.
[03:59.85]So we might be moving on from this if it's lags my whole computer and I can't stream it.
[04:04.65]It might be possible.
[04:05.43]I don't know.
[04:06.96]We'll see.
[04:10.36]OK, Wreckfest, it says this they have more technology in this one.
[04:14.16]I don't know how that how do you have like more technology?
[04:25.81]The last one was crazy.
[04:28.41]Apparently there's more.
[04:35.69]Patented tech.
[04:43.47]It's going to be a good stream today.
[04:44.49]I think so.
[04:47.34]Hey, I'm I'm here to have good screams.
[04:50.08]I'm here to have fun streams.
[04:51.24]I'm here to play games that I think are interesting.
[04:53.00]That's what I'm doing here.
[05:00.80]Yeah, I did the JFK impression already.
[05:03.91]Already happened.
[05:04.41]Oh, that's just what he does.
[05:10.81]That's what I do.
[05:17.37]I just waiting for the first ad break to get rid of the pre-rolls and get us started.
[05:28.12]Which they should have popped up by now, but you know how it is.
[05:30.48]Sometimes it takes an extra minute.
[05:31.68]We can just chill and talk.
[05:37.26]I have dishes to do?
[05:38.96]What about Arx... Arx Vitalis is probably not happening for at least a week.
[05:45.43]At least.
[05:46.53]Sorry, it got bumped.
[05:48.39]It got smushed.
[05:49.53]Because this weekend, I think me and Ster are going to do Dark Souls 3 co-op mod.

[06:41.43]The ADHD docket, yeah.
[06:56.47]Is Dracula 3 unreleased?
[06:59.93]Uh, no.
[07:00.13]Dracula 3 is... It came out a very long time ago.
[07:04.83]Uh, I would say it came out about 25 years ago.
[07:14.08]Sorcery?
[07:14.76]Yeah, and you know what?
[07:15.74]Like, I might even finish Sorcery.
[07:19.26]I actually, I did contemplate Infinity Nikki.
[07:21.84]I'm not even kidding.
[07:23.08]I was like, you know what?
[07:23.62]What if I just open that in the next day or two?
[07:28.46]Hey, the beauty of me streaming much more is there's way more shit to push forever.
[07:32.70]Do you know what I mean?
[07:35.83]The beauty of me streaming what's been three to five days a week now is, I mean, like, I can just keep pushing.
[07:40.93]We can keep adding more things to push forever.
[07:45.82]Alright.
[07:47.02]Getting started in three minutes exactly.
[07:49.06]Ads are going to play here for a few minutes.
[07:51.50]Get rid of the pre-rolls.
[07:52.49]Get started.
[07:53.03]I'll be right back.
[07:55.31]See you guys in three minutes.
[07:57.77]And we go.
[07:58.23]Wreckfest.
[08:01.16]Here we go.
[12:08.29]Alright, we're back.
[12:10.19]We can get started now.
[12:14.61]And sometimes the the ad player likes to wait an extra 5 to 10 minutes.
[12:20.28]Don't know why, but it does.
[12:22.68]Oh good, I got my coffee.
[12:23.66]I'm ready.
[12:26.06]Strap in.
[12:27.98]Let's fucking go.
[12:31.92]What about the big red countdown?
[12:33.52]Yeah, I gotta get a 10 minute countdown.
[12:38.38]It will be helpful.
[12:40.92]Alright, let's go.
[12:43.84]Let's see how this runs.
[12:45.00]I am concerned that it's going to run like shit.
[12:48.58]So be prepared for a million drop frames.
[12:53.03]Okay, so I can go into my garage.
[13:02.65]I opened this and I don't know how this works.
[13:05.67]If I say new car, I just get another one of these.
[13:09.72]What about create paint car?
[13:18.28]Is there any audio in this game?
[13:23.12]I think I need the mouse.
[13:23.78]What color car should I do?
[13:27.92]Red?
[13:33.94]Blue?
[13:37.85]How about green?
[13:38.97]I like this color.
[13:43.80]Uh... Should I just make, like, a piece of shit?
[13:48.90]Like, does it matter?
[13:54.85]How about green?
[13:58.43]Dark blue.
[14:02.41]Red.
[14:02.69]Oh, orange.
[14:06.11]Let's make a Sherbert car.
[14:15.55]That looks good.
[14:21.17]That's a pretty delicious sherbert car.
[14:26.69]The blue is OK.
[14:28.29]The bumper does not work.
[14:29.13]Hold on.
[14:33.09]This is going to be orange.
[14:34.51]It was going to be a true sherbert.
[14:40.38]Yeah.
[14:43.16]Okay, so now what?
[14:44.24]Save it.
[14:45.99]Save to current design.
[14:47.11]Okay.
[14:48.11]Apply.
[14:49.49]Save.
[14:50.31]Save.
[14:51.23]Alright, now get out.
[14:53.57]Alright, my designs.
[14:54.53]There it is.
[14:55.17]Alright.
[14:56.73]Let's go.
[14:57.09]So I'm just going to play.
[14:59.97]Should I do just a multiplayer match?
[15:02.40]People are just going to crash into each other.
[15:04.38]That's the whole game, right?
[15:06.00]What about just quick race?
[15:08.30]Wait, no, no, no.
[15:09.40]I forgot about this.
[15:09.98]They have like the playground.
[15:11.70]Yeah.
[15:13.56]Let me test the cars out first.
[15:18.88]Car damage normal.
[15:22.60]So apparently there's even more damage.
[15:28.02]The first game was called Wreckfest.
[15:29.51]I don't know how you make more damage in this game.
[15:33.83]Did I just do normal?
[15:36.65]Time limit?
[15:37.17]No time limit.
[15:43.90]Do I have to go all the way up here?
[15:45.70]I'm not going to be here for 40 minutes, okay?
[15:49.14]Demolition Deathmatch?
[15:50.24]No, no, no.
[15:50.46]I just want to, like, drive around and crash into stuff.
[15:54.15]Okay, I think I can only do Deathmatch.
[15:58.89]Alright, well, let's just go.
[16:01.79]Alright, here we go.
[16:06.09]Are you pro or anti-Glorp?
[16:10.65]Uh, I'm... Glorp is fine.
[16:16.47]Alright, is it deathmatch?
[16:17.49]Why is my car already a piece of shit?
[16:26.00]Okay.
[16:28.82]Why were there other people on the other side of the road?
[16:31.62]What?
[16:34.63]How do I flip the car over?
[16:35.67]It's deathmatch.
[16:39.09]How do I change the camera angle?
[16:50.06]How do I fix this?
[16:51.50]Oh, there we go.
[16:52.44]I'll go for.
[17:08.89]The front of the car is already smushed in so bad.
[17:19.13]So how bad can you fuck up the car?
[17:21.09]That's what I want to know.
[17:21.99]That's the reason why I bought the game.
[17:25.68]I want to turn into a cube at the end of this.
[17:40.47]There's got to be a better camera angle, right?
[17:42.63]Oh my God.
[17:43.13]Alright, that is actually a lot of damage.
[17:51.09]How do I get?
[17:51.81]I fucking hate this camera angle.
[17:56.99]What's a better camera angle?
[17:58.29]What the fuck?
[18:03.72]Where am I going?
[18:05.46]Oh Jesus.
[18:10.96]Why is this like it's one of those teeth?
[18:13.32]My head's gone.
[18:17.34]But where?
[18:17.74]Oh my God, dude.
[18:22.78]But where is the car?
[18:25.82]Where is it?
[18:29.15]Okay, my mouth is... My face is crushed into... Okay, this is not good.
[18:33.21]Why can't I see the car anymore?
[18:40.70]Um... Does anybody know what the button is to, like, see the car?
[18:44.76]I can't even respawn.
[18:56.41]I can't respawn.
[19:02.17]Oh my god, it's just me.
[19:03.81]It's actually just me curled up and on fire.
[19:08.53]This is horrible.
[19:10.31]This is awful.
[19:11.87]Oh my goodness.
[19:12.69]That was awful.
[19:15.31]I can't respawn.
[19:17.41]A?
[19:19.51]None is respawn.
[19:20.89]None is quit.
[19:21.81]What the fuck is going on?
[19:27.92]Okay.
[19:31.12]I'm so confused with the controls.
[19:32.46]Oh, alright.
[19:35.28]There I am again.
[19:36.08]I'm fine.
[19:36.68]Everything's going fine.
[19:38.75]First gear.
[19:41.55]I can put my fingers up.
[19:45.95]Right.
[19:46.19]But how do I get back to... There it is.
[19:47.90]Okay.
[19:48.36]It's... It's... Why?
[20:07.76]Hey peace man.
[20:15.15]I want to get that off the screen.
[20:17.19]Holy shit.
[20:17.73]Actually, I think it is a lot more damage than the first one.
[20:23.97]Alright, let me actually try to stay alive.
[20:33.18]I can't.
[20:33.72]I can't do a multiplayer race.
[20:34.98]That's gonna be so funny.
[20:44.92]Alright, let's get lined up here.
[20:49.90]Alright.
[20:50.36]I'm going to try going over the loop-a-loop.
[20:55.10]That did not work.
[21:01.79]Come on.
[21:08.03]I need a better car than this.
[21:18.01]This is so funny, this deathmatch.
[21:19.87]This place is so huge.
[21:20.97]There's other cars have just been destroyed.
[21:22.59]There's no other cars here.
[21:26.75]I love that you can go inside though.
[21:28.37]That's so funny.
[21:33.98]Go in the hamster.
[21:34.58]I want to try this first.
[21:49.75]Is it going to be an explosion?
[21:59.96]Not really.
[22:00.56]I'm still fine.
[22:13.39]You can't park there.
[22:14.33]No, I can't.
[22:19.64]Oh, I gotta go into the crusher.
[22:21.00]Are you serious?
[22:30.00]He's thinking when I was a fucking cube on fire.
[22:42.03]I'm alright.
[22:44.59]Oh no, not.
[22:51.18]This is turning into a Model T. Alright, can I just get out of this?
[22:55.92]Okay, there we go.
[22:56.58]Now I'm good.
[22:56.98]Fucking crumpled up piece of paper.
[23:19.60]I love how you can give the peace sign.
[23:26.27]Now it's way more aerodynamic.
[23:27.63]It's true.
[23:31.75]I cannot steer this.
[23:36.69]That was pretty sick though.
[24:00.96]Can you pull this out a little?
[24:03.30]I would love to get this view, but zoomed out like 10%.
[24:11.78]Nice posture.
[24:12.58]You know, I can't believe my head was in my groin.
[24:16.26]My head was like on my fucking penis.
[24:18.82]That was so weird.
[24:47.65]I don't even know where I'm going.
[24:49.71]I'm going really fast wherever it is.
[24:55.34]How am I not hitting anything?
[24:57.88]What?
[24:58.20]This looks like with the orangutans driving the golf cart.
[25:10.99]Doesn't it?
[25:25.18]That's the best feature they ever added.
[25:28.85]Seriously.
[25:29.21]Am I upside down?
[25:30.71]Oh, man.
[25:42.20]Alright, let me try to actually do a trick.
[25:51.44]I want to try to jump that.
[25:56.96]Then I'll actually do a race.
[25:58.08]I'll actually play the game.
[26:14.84]Is there a spider?
[26:15.52]Yeah, is there a giant enemy spider here?
[26:17.06]I can get shot out of a cannon though.
[26:21.68]what have we got here this is a big jump alright I gotta I'll try and go for the momentum here here we go this is right this is a tight corner it's gonna be tough hold on punch it let's go
[26:59.66]That's just what he does.
[27:02.35]I'm so glad you guys are doing that.
[27:04.27]And it's not me, so no one can say it's my USB doing it.
[27:07.33]Let's get you out of the cannon.
[27:27.84]Do you get any other cars?
[27:28.78]I have these, like, really piece of shit cars.
[27:34.41]Oof.
[27:36.89]I wasn't ready for that.
[27:42.91]We're fine.
[27:52.00]Alright, you're Uber...
[27:59.84]Your Uber rolls up looking like this.
[28:01.24]Do you get in?
[28:03.96]And he has the helmet on too.
[28:14.15]Damn, this is actually kind of cool.
[28:16.09]I kind of would want to drive a car like this.
[28:18.15]This is like sick.
[28:21.21]Just a little thin car like this would be so fun.
[28:31.08]Did I fly?
[28:31.50]I thought I just flew out of the windshield.
[28:32.50]Oh boy.
[28:32.90]That's going to happen again.
[28:46.49]I love how the person is still there.
[28:48.65]This is so weird.
[28:57.56]I can't respawn.
[28:58.38]I have to
[29:01.65]Alright, let me do an actual race.
[29:09.24]Let's go.
[29:15.24]Okay.
[29:15.76]I just want to do a single player quick race.
[29:21.51]I'll do a multiplayer quick race too.
[29:23.21]What's going to happen?
[29:23.81]I already know.
[29:26.05]Everyone's going to turn around and just do the Mario Kart thing.
[29:28.69]It's every GTA race you've ever seen in your life.
[29:37.98]OK.
[29:41.78]Loading vehicles.
[29:42.94]Oh God, this is going to crash my computer.
[29:46.52]That car exists.
[29:47.12]It's called the Tango.
[29:53.56]Imagine this shit on multiplayer is going to be so funny.
[29:55.82]It's not as too many cars on the road to even have a race.
[30:12.38]Yeah, nice job.
[30:12.96]Trying to run me off the road, you got yourself attacked.
[30:22.93]Ugh.
[30:23.01]He just fucking rammed.
[30:40.06]In multiplayer, it's probably going to be so laggy.
[30:44.98]We have to have like 30 cars all rendering 30 different 10,000 damage points on their vehicle.
[30:53.15]You're going to need to have like a quad SLI.
[30:57.05]Uh-oh.
[31:05.04]That's a big problem, but I'm actually in seventh place.
[31:07.06]I'm doing good.
[31:10.92]Okay, does that shit even exist anymore?
[31:12.56]Can you do a qu- SL- Do anybody even do- That doesn't exist anymore.
[31:17.40]Quad SLI?
[31:18.46]Remember when people were doing that?
[31:23.40]They linked four graphics cards together.
[31:28.96]SLI is not supported anymore.
[31:30.80]Okay, did SLI even do anything?
[31:34.06]I feel like games couldn't even use the kick ability.
[31:37.82]Maybe rendering?
[31:38.62]Like rendering video files?
[31:46.75]Get that first place, excuse me.
[31:53.91]Oh!
[31:55.49]No!
[31:55.88]Fuck.
[32:03.16]I'm using a controller, not a keyboard.
[32:05.44]I'm a controller user.
[32:16.97]It just raised your power bill.
[32:25.24]Wow, that is crazy.
[32:28.68]What the heck?
[32:32.02]You guys see that?
[32:33.52]Why this car sucks?
[32:37.81]Might do.
[32:39.59]Nice job.
[32:43.45]I'm doing multiplayer after this.
[32:46.36]Alright, can we do, should we do a prediction?
[32:50.16]Is there an explosion at the starting line in my first multiplayer game of the night?
[32:57.68]Is there an explosion?
[32:59.04]And by explosion, I mean a visible fire at the starting line.
[33:13.96]People are such dickheads in these games that there's no way.
[33:17.52]That's three points.
[33:29.66]I keep holding A to do handbrake and I don't even know if that is doing anything.
[33:34.59]It might even be a different button.
[33:45.79]Alright, may as well just fuck with everybody now.
[33:53.60]Alright, it's time to be a road hazard.
[33:56.97]How many fucking assholes are going to do this to?
[34:24.86]Wait, I have to press the reset button.
[34:40.46]Maybe it's B. The goal is just to finish the race in this, I think.
[34:59.06]And I also have to do one whole race where I'm in the cockpit only.
[35:04.93]In multiplayer.
[35:08.67]I just destroyed that guy.
[35:10.01]That guy got fucking annihilated.
[35:11.13]Alright, that's fine.
[35:23.20]Alright, it's time.
[35:26.49]It's time just to, it's time to crash my computer.
[35:43.74]I mean, the game just came out literally like four hours ago.
[35:56.96]BeamNG has some really fun challenge modes.
[35:59.88]I played it a long time ago.
[36:01.02]Does it, does it need to be right at the start or anytime?
[36:08.71]I would say within, within one minute of the race starting.
[36:14.75]That has to be like right at the very beginning.
[36:19.43]Max client's reach, what?
[36:28.89]No, okay.
[36:29.35]No, you know what?
[36:29.89]That's fair.
[36:30.27]That's fair.
[36:30.85]That's fair.
[36:31.67]As long as there is a visible fire at the start.
[36:33.72]That's true.
[36:35.36]That makes more sense.
[36:36.08]Because, like, what if I don't see it until I do a lap?
[36:39.60]But here's the thing.
[36:40.52]Some of you could be sniping.
[36:41.86]There we go.
[36:54.12]Alright.
[36:56.09]Alright, dude, this is going to be crazy.
[36:58.45]We're going to Bone Breaker.
[37:02.65]How many people are here?
[37:03.61]Okay, dude, there's like 15 to 20 people here.
[37:13.18]This is going to be fucked up.
[37:14.14]Alright, get ready up.
[37:22.29]Alright, ready up.
[37:26.95]I can't, I can't click the button.
[37:37.19]Is it, wait, they going already?
[37:38.23]This one's already going.
[38:02.46]Alright, I'm ready.
[38:03.02]I'm ready.
[38:03.30]I'm ready.
[38:03.78]I'm readying up.
[38:04.30]I want to play.
[38:05.14]No, I don't want to spectate.
[38:06.49]I want to play.
[38:09.11]Turn off spectator.
[38:09.79]There we go.
[38:10.11]Alright, ready up.
[38:16.41]Let's go.
[38:16.75]That's a lot of did not finishes.
[38:24.16]Yeah.
[38:29.74]My HUD was gone for the whole race.
[38:33.82]I don't think this is gonna, I don't think this is, uh, this might not be tested.
[38:37.33]Alright, here we go.
[38:38.65]Let's do it.
[38:52.85]Actually pretty clean.
[39:00.50]Oh, I just caused such a hazard.
[39:01.80]I just fucked everybody up with this.
[39:05.57]Why am I following that guy?
[39:06.71]He drove into the wall.
[39:07.69]Dude, I should have... The bet should have been, will I win the race?
[39:21.30]Because, um... Excuse me?
[39:30.21]No.
[39:41.58]That guy just fucked up everything.
[39:43.02]I've been there, man.
[39:44.64]Oh, you just killed me.
[39:50.88]No.
[39:52.60]What am I hitting?
[39:58.06]It's alright.
[39:58.50]It's alright.
[39:58.82]It's alright.
[39:59.28]It's alright.
[40:04.57]Geez.
[40:08.80]Oh, that's a bot.
[40:11.30]Come on, I thought that was a flare.
[40:24.36]As long as I finish in the top 10, I don't care.
[40:33.55]Get out of the fucking way!
[40:37.75]It's not even a player and he's just... He's just BMing so bad!
[40:43.61]He's fucking with me!
[40:44.78]He's fucking me up!
[40:55.28]That guy's gone.
[41:05.91]He lost to the bot.
[41:07.13]That bot was doing a lot of work, OK?
[41:24.58]Make some ground here.
[41:30.44]This is 10 laps.
[41:35.30]How is anybody gonna survive 10 left?
[41:38.96]There he is again.
[41:42.03]I'm gonna brake check this guy.
[41:49.35]Fuck.
[42:05.25]At what point are these doors just kind of like... They kind of look like an elephant.
[42:09.28]I have like big elephant ears.
[42:15.74]It's kind of cute.
[42:17.40]I kind of think it's cute.
[42:22.72]I can't close them?
[42:23.86]Just weld them shut at some point.
[42:28.71]There are 10... No wonder people are going to just leave the game.
[42:34.91]Hey, top 10 is all I care about.
[42:36.79]That means I just have to survive.
[42:43.86]No.
[42:44.08]Yeah, what's the point of a trunk?
[42:49.74]I think that guy was in first place.
[42:58.22]That guy definitely smashed his hands on his keyboard.
[43:00.39]Like, what a fucking idiot.
[43:03.53]Uh-oh.
[43:18.20]What is this guy doing?
[43:21.62]He's doing the thing he's doing the thing he's doing the thing How has nobody done this I Was gonna say I am like any time you see this on the road it's just drive into it as fast as you can I
[43:44.82]I actually can't... That was a good turn.
[43:56.65]Okay.
[44:08.02]Oh, that's points for me.
[44:09.88]That's points for me.
[44:22.48]No, it's this turn every time.
[44:24.04]I'm going to explode.
[44:27.07]Every human player keeps crashing.
[44:29.15]You know what?
[44:29.59]Fuck it.
[44:30.57]We're going to observe.
[44:31.29]I'm going to be one of those... I'm going to be one of those people that sits and needs to observe an intersection to see if a traffic light needs to go there.
[44:42.66]There's been 2,500 accidents at this one spot.
[45:00.65]I can't even look through the... There we go.
[45:06.58]Okay, good.
[45:07.12]I'll just... See?
[45:10.94]Bot.
[45:13.02]Human.
[45:14.10]Good turn.
[45:14.92]Okay, maybe we don't need a stoplight here.
[45:19.32]Not bad.
[45:20.28]Hmm?
[45:27.48]Why are they not being as bad as I am?
[45:38.91]That person's car is fucked and they were able to do the turn simply?
[45:43.03]Why?
[45:43.47]No?
[45:47.79]Okay.
[45:50.26]Ah!
[45:51.52]Almost.
[45:52.80]Okay, these are the humans.
[45:54.46]These are the humans.
[45:56.20]These are the humans.
[45:57.16]They just almost fucked it up.
[45:58.12]Those are two.
[45:58.56]Those are three humans.
[45:59.36]Those are two human.
[46:09.77]I think that has a whole cycle has gone by.
[46:11.91]Nobody did it.
[46:12.73]How?
[46:12.97]Why am I doing this though?
[46:14.43]I'm hitting break.
[46:16.49]I'm hitting handbrake.
[46:17.35]I don't understand.
[46:32.24]Plug in the controller.
[46:34.82]For some reason, I just have so much forward momentum.
[46:38.29]What?
[46:38.53]I don't know.
[46:38.99]You're still in 15th.
[46:39.73]Yeah, because there's only 15 people playing.
[46:41.71]The other 10 people got killed.
[46:43.77]Oh, now it's lonely.
[46:47.57]Is there at least a horn?
[47:04.07]I love it.
[47:05.17]I'm a fan.
[47:08.23]Yeah, let's go.
[47:09.49]Let's go.
[47:09.97]I love Wreckfest.
[47:20.53]I'm the only fan here.
[47:24.61]How is everybody taking this so well?
[47:26.23]It's actually making me actually mad.
[47:31.15]You guys can do it.
[47:32.03]I'm a huge fan, by the way.
[47:37.58]Oh, there goes the green destroyer.
[47:39.26]That's my favorite.
[47:42.42]Why don't I try it?
[47:43.78]Why don't I try?
[47:44.38]Maybe I could.
[47:45.58]Maybe I could do it.
[47:48.38]I think I could probably do it.
[47:49.34]Maybe I can.
[47:49.92]Maybe I can get an autograph from the green destroyer.
[47:53.11]That would be epic.
[47:58.83]Imagine if I beat the green destroyer in a race.
[48:04.95]I don't even know what direction I'm in.
[48:10.38]Hey, Green Destroyer!
[48:12.72]Green Destru- Maybe I can get his theme song on DVD!
[48:30.70]Am I even on a track?
[48:32.74]Okay, I'm just being a fucking asshole.
[48:34.92]I can't do this.
[48:36.32]That's being a fucking asshole.
[48:38.06]There's 10 left.
[48:39.32]How am I only on lap four?
[48:41.44]Am I going the right way?
[48:48.57]Green destroyer.
[48:49.37]Do you see my car?
[48:50.11]It's also green.
[48:53.31]Oh, let me just shift.
[48:57.49]I painted my car just like yours.
[49:07.12]What's your famous throw up the green sign?
[49:11.22]Yeah.
[49:11.70]Am I flying?
[49:24.39]Oh, that's another person.
[49:45.92]Hey, bro.
[49:46.74]Yeah.
[49:48.94]I'm just watching, too.
[49:53.15]You wouldn't happen to be a fan of the Green Destroyer, would you?
[49:58.01]No?
[49:58.65]You're the Red Ranger?
[50:03.01]Uh, where's the boo?
[50:04.03]Do you think after the race they'll do a signing of some kind?
[50:13.70]That's why I came here.
[50:18.65]I gotta get ready.
[50:19.19]I gotta do something.
[50:19.89]I gotta get some injuries.
[50:22.44]Otherwise, he won't think I'm fucking for real.
[50:25.28]If I don't get at least a few injuries, he's not gonna take me seriously.
[50:37.34]My back really hurts right now, though.
[50:46.26]Am I even still on the track?
[50:54.92]Oh, well, there's always lunch.
[51:09.88]Okay, is there other tracks we can go on to?
[51:11.92]I want to do this a few more times.
[51:14.12]I was having fun.
[51:15.64]You're RPing in Wreckfest.
[51:17.16]Hey, I'm just, whatever.
[51:18.42]Oh, this is Speedway Figure 8.
[51:21.50]This is a perfect opportunity to get an autograph from the Grand Destroyer.
[51:29.60]I can't ready up.
[51:34.88]Why not?
[51:40.42]There we go.
[51:49.24]I finally got into a race!
[51:50.47]There's a qualifier, but it's still one day... No, actually, I want to play.
[51:57.75]I thought I would actually play.
[52:12.27]What the hell?
[52:13.65]I don't even know what the handbrake button is.
[52:15.85]Can somebody look it up?
[52:17.65]Somebody look it up.
[52:19.01]What's the handbrake button?
[52:19.87]Somebody look it up.
[52:28.98]What is it on controller?
[52:31.10]R1?
[52:35.30]It's B?
[52:35.68]Bro, share the road!
[52:44.12]Share the road!
[52:51.31]It's B?
[52:51.73]Alright, nice.
[53:22.01]Oh, opportunity.
[53:22.93]12, how do you even, how are you in first place in this game?
[53:36.64]Easy.
[53:36.94]No, it's going to be me.
[53:44.58]First place is usually the purple dragon.
[53:47.20]Second place is usually Green Destroyer.
[53:48.64]Third place is usually the orange oranges.
[53:53.66]That's a team, by the way.
[53:54.62]It's a, it's a, it's a father and son.
[53:57.56]I didn't say it wrong.
[53:59.74]It's my dream to one day be able to qualify and get up to the fourth place.
[54:05.65]All you fucking losers, all your opposers.
[54:08.37]I'm the true fan, and I'm gonna be the one that'll get qualified first place, second place, or fourth place.
[54:15.37]You're all fake fans.
[54:16.13]You don't even... Oh yeah?
[54:18.30]You're a real fan?
[54:20.48]When was... When... When was this first qualifier if you're such a fan?
[54:36.11]I'm fine.
[54:36.37]I'm still in 14th place.
[54:37.65]We're fine.
[54:47.29]Back to RP.
[54:48.43]Hey, when you're... Uh-oh.
[54:51.29]That person's on fire.
[54:52.27]Hey, when you're bad at a video game, you just have to... Hey, don't you think that's a little rude?
[55:06.28]How am I still in 13th place after just driving off the road?
[55:12.22]Everyone can hear me?
[55:13.08]It's voice chat?
[55:14.08]No.
[55:15.98]I don't hear anybody else.
[55:24.07]Do I just have a hot mic right now?
[55:25.57]I hope not.
[55:29.60]That was the Green Destroyer!
[55:31.24]That was the... Guys!
[55:31.88]Guys, I'm sorry.
[55:33.36]I'm sorry.
[55:33.74]But I just... Hold on.
[55:34.56]I didn't see it.
[55:36.38]Did you see that?
[55:44.09]I'm not even doing this on purpose.
[55:46.89]No, I'm sorry.
[56:09.42]That sucks so bad, having to go across like that.
[56:11.78]Alright, if I have enough, hold on, I need to help that guy.
[56:21.36]I could never leave a fellow adventurer.
[56:29.78]I'm here.
[56:30.08]The green, the green, what's his name?
[56:35.33]The green destroyer would never leave a fellow racer behind.
[56:39.12]Do you need a jump?
[56:45.86]I have cables in the back if you need them.
[56:48.50]I would never leave behind a fellow race car adventurer driver.
[57:00.13]I'll just tell you.
[57:01.79]Oh, that's poisonous smoke.
[57:08.26]I'll try.
[57:15.13]Okay, let's go!
[57:17.83]Hit the gas!
[57:22.06]Try hitting the gas!
[57:33.06]Okay, now if you just... I don't think I can help...
[57:48.52]Okay, I'm actually fucking up everything.
[57:50.34]I'm actually fucking up everything.
[57:51.66]I gotta go.
[57:53.26]Oh shit, I'm fucking... I'm in a fucking Flintstones car.
[58:12.03]Well, why is the... Holy shit, I almost just killed that guy.
[58:16.43]Why is this... This game is so much fun.
[58:20.67]Oh, alright.
[58:21.41]Hey, RecFest2Developers.
[58:23.61]Can you add them getting out of the car?
[58:33.16]Can I get out of the car and go talk to people?
[58:44.18]Just make it GTA 6.
[58:49.12]Please get a new car.
[58:49.98]I'm begging you.
[58:50.76]Is my car a piece of shit?
[59:03.24]Wait, hold on.
[59:04.38]Everyone was waiting for me to finish the race?
[59:07.66]Were people watching that?
[59:09.40]They must have thought I was just some asshole just doing it on purpose to be mean and like annoyed because I lost.
[59:15.64]no no I that's not what's going on oh that's not good that makes me look like a dick that's not what I wanted to do I thought that just said Mario circuit by the way I was about to go no way oh uh if you if you uh those of you that like found the stream oh my computer crashed oh am I alive okay I think I'm still live

[59:49.83]Did I just get booted from the lobby?
[60:05.26]I think I'm good.

[60:57.78]Yeah, but OK, fine.
[61:04.62]And I'll just make it something goofy.
[61:07.77]I will actually make it an actual clown car.
[61:17.77]But pink and red.
[61:28.48]Blue, right?
[61:47.62]Can you do polka dots?
[61:58.00]Wait, is it yellow?
[62:03.28]It's yellow?
[62:03.82]No, no, it usually... Wait, it's yellow and red with red dots usually, right?
[62:12.63]Or blue and red with pink dots?
[62:14.47]You can't really do very much else.
[62:22.33]Does it really... I don't even care.
[62:24.97]The game crashed.
[62:26.13]Fuck.
[62:29.63]Alright, I'm just gonna pick it and go.
[62:39.69]You gotta take the wins by getting into the game.
[62:45.72]You laugh at any car crash.
[62:48.50]I mean... This game's a little humorous.
[62:59.30]It should be selected.
[63:00.10]Okay, here we go.
[63:20.71]This is a car.
[63:21.43]This is the car crash game.
[63:22.89]Yeah, it is.
[63:37.03]You should play more Zombieville.
[63:39.87]That game's great.
[63:49.10]I played a little bit more of it off stream.
[63:51.94]The ticket was canceled for an unknown reason.
[63:53.96]Okay.
[63:54.92]We might have some trouble with multiplayer right now.
[64:05.95]Sandpit, scrap your art, which I've not seen this one.
[64:09.19]Let me see this one.
[64:19.15]Unironically banned.
[64:21.84]Wait, is this the first one we did?
[64:24.04]Maybe I've seen it already.
[64:30.62]Too many clown activities.
[64:35.59]Hey, it was fun.
[64:48.17]This is different.
[65:02.06]So this is all the content in the early access right now.
[65:08.65]I feel like when Wreckfest 1 came out, it was very similar.
[65:16.01]I don't know how much more stuff was put in Wreckfest.
[65:19.69]Was it like a huge game eventually?
[65:21.21]Oof.
[65:40.47]You old enough to remember Destruction Derby?
[65:42.49]Oh yeah.
[65:52.79]I got a break coming up here in a minute or two.
[65:54.71]Kind of at the hour.
[65:59.42]I want to do, I want to try to do another one or two multiplayer races because that was a lot of fun.
[66:03.78]If I still can't get into a game, then we'll just go, we'll do Laundry Simulator.
[66:08.55]That was the next plan.
[66:09.35]Just fuck that guy up.
[66:16.54]Am I pushing the button down too hard?
[66:17.90]Yeah, destruction derbies.
[66:23.92]Funny you mentioned that.
[66:33.28]I've always wanted to do.
[66:35.04]This is like a super pipe dream kind of thing.
[66:40.60]I've always wanted to do like a streamer destruction derby.
[66:46.38]But there's so much liability with that.
[66:50.56]And I remember a while ago, I remember during the off-brand days, we had talked about it a little bit.
[66:56.62]Like maybe could we do that?
[66:58.66]But it was just like, it's too fucking much liability and too crazy.
[67:02.32]But there were like avenues to maybe do it, but that would have been probably one of the most expensive shows ever.
[67:08.53]Ever.
[67:09.90]It would have been so much insurance, so much fucking money would have had to go into it.
[67:14.17]It was a lot that needed to have happen, potentially.
[67:19.45]But it's always something I thought would be really funny and really fun.
[67:26.90]Alright, let's, you know what?
[67:28.10]I'm going to take a break.
[67:29.44]I'm getting up.
[67:31.04]I'll be back.
[67:33.98]What about, yeah, professional drivers supported by the streamers would be cool.
[67:42.89]Are you going to do IRL laundry?
[67:45.21]No.
[67:49.13]We're doing laundry simulator.
[67:53.16]So when I come back, I will try it.
[67:54.62]We'll try it again.
[67:55.22]If I can get in a multiplayer game.
[67:57.48]I'm glad I at least got into a few of them.
[67:59.20]That was really funny.
[68:01.32]But I'll be right back.
[68:02.68]And we'll see what we're going to do.
[68:04.30]BRB.
[70:38.01]Thank you.
[71:12.78]what's up what's up okay yeah I want to try to get another multiplayer welcome back uh I think the game has been really loud the whole time but that's kind of funny because it of course it should be loud
[71:41.75]I like this track though.
[71:43.55]This one's good.
[71:54.94]Could you hit a Lala for old time's sake?
[71:57.62]That was like a year ago.
[72:00.02]And I just made up the old time's sake part.
[72:04.66]Alright, let's try it again.
[72:05.36]Everybody cross your fingers.
[72:07.88]See if we can get in the game.
[72:08.54]Alright.
[72:16.62]Come on.
[72:24.41]Get us in the game.
[72:28.37]I want one more multiplayer session and then we can play Laundry.
[72:34.37]That was seven years ago.
[72:35.43]There.
[72:53.66]That was four years ago?
[72:54.60]I feel like it's been a thing every two years for eight years.
[73:01.37]Shit.
[73:22.73]Keep trying.
[73:23.27]Servers are broken.
[73:25.63]I would imagine it's probably... It's brand new.
[73:30.13]It's early access.
[73:31.87]There's probably a lot of people just trying to do it at the same time.
[73:38.22]Server not allocated.
[73:39.30]Okay.
[73:39.60]Oh.
[73:39.68]Maybe?
[73:51.71]Maybe?
[73:53.61]shit maybe the server browser yeah server browser might be good but usually server browser has can you put a pat oh fuck alright I'm gonna I'm gonna give it three more attempts the green destroyer took out
[74:17.05]I'll try three more times and we'll do laundry.
[74:18.67]I think I got.
[74:20.45]I got what I wanted out of this early access the launch day anyways.
[74:41.06]Sir, what can I do server browser?
[74:45.49]In lobby, in lobby, EU.
[74:49.85]Racing.
[74:52.46]Original Wreckfest 2.
[74:58.62]It's okay.
[74:59.14]Did I get IP banned?
[75:05.53]No, I definitely did not.
[75:11.75]Restart the game, maybe?
[75:15.34]Just do laundry.
[75:17.68]A lot of servers are on fire right now.
[75:22.49]I don't see any races.
[75:23.59]Wait, what do you mean?
[75:28.75]You know what?
[75:29.61]I want to do laundry anyways.
[75:32.24]That was fun.
[75:35.86]That was great.
[75:36.36]That's claps in the chat.
[75:38.20]I had a lot of fun with it.
[75:42.06]If I get the urge later, maybe I'll try and come back.
[75:50.00]Because the thing with a server browser is you might have to sit there for a long time because some of those like zero out of 24 might take a long time for anyone to even join it.
[75:59.61]But yeah, that was about an hour and 10 minutes worth of... It was a good time.
[76:09.84]Let's do the laundry game.
