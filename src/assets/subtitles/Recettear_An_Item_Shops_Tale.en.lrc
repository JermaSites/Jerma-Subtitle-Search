[00:15.64]Hi guys, I didn't mean to turn that off.
[00:20.72]This is the game.
[00:22.18]Hold on, I'm not quite ready to start yet.
[00:25.20]This is a game where you play, you run an item store.
[00:43.34]You have to sell and trade products.
[00:47.78]And over the course of that time, try to make as much money as possible to... I don't know.
[00:57.97]I have no idea what this is.
[00:59.15]I was told that this is a fun game.
[01:06.02]I can't skip this.
[01:07.88]Why can I no longer skip this?
[01:09.18]Oh, hi, there we go.
[01:13.63]Hey, everybody.
[01:14.45]Hold on.
[01:15.07]I'm not ready yet.
[01:16.89]Just pretend I wasn't here.
[01:38.98]Okay, that's better.
[01:39.80]I actually did not mean to show you that.
[01:42.37]But I did.
[01:43.37]Accident... No, I don't... Why is this popping up?
[01:47.73]This is all... My stream deck is so wrong right now.
[01:51.90]I better not fuck around with this, because if I turn the camera on, it's going to be embarrassing.
[01:55.18]So, I'm just going to do it by hand.
[01:56.44]Manulate.
[01:56.98]Manulate.
[02:02.61]Alright.
[02:03.79]Yeah, we're gonna play, uh, Re... Recettear.
[02:06.94]An item shop's tale.
[02:07.94]This is something that people thought I would like.
[02:10.04]It's about trading stocks.
[02:13.34]And, um, going on adventures with your friends.
[02:18.06]And you know how I love the markets.
[02:19.31]Did I say it?
[02:25.51]What am I... Did I say it?
[02:35.24]What are you linking me?
[02:38.92]What is this?
[02:41.20]What the fuck is this?
[02:49.88]What, what is this?
[02:52.25]That's a real ad.
[02:57.61]No, it's not.
[02:58.93]Somebody, one of you, like, meme aficionados doctored that shit.
[03:05.99]That's real.
[03:08.23]Let me say it again, hold on.
[03:13.65]I'm fu- No, stop, this is so loud!
[03:21.15]Where is it?
[03:23.79]Why do I have... a porn ad?
[03:27.29]Somebody link it.
[03:29.01]Lucky Crush?
[03:36.67]What is this implying?
[03:37.57]Is this implying that I'm chatting with this girl?
[03:40.47]Or is she watching me?
[03:44.37]Am I the porn?
[03:46.57]Or are they the porn?
[03:47.79]I don't understand.
[03:53.59]Why this clip?
[03:55.03]Where did you get this GIF from?
[04:00.22]I'm the chatter?
[04:04.38]Turn this off.
[04:09.96]I gotta, hold on, this is important.
[04:14.55]Why?
[04:15.79]Where did you find this?
[04:21.57]Acting like he doesn't know.
[04:26.96]Streamer, what?
[04:29.40]Alright, well that's, that's fucking weird.
[04:31.58]I don't know, I don't know what website, don't go to this website, because they're probably just going to like take your data.
[04:40.29]I would be careful of that, like, database.
[04:42.29]So, I don't know what that is.
[04:46.72]I don't endorse that website.
[04:48.30]I'm not part of that website.
[04:52.48]Make sure you don't have your credit card on a notepad on your computer if you click on that link.
[04:56.83]Okay?
[05:01.39]Anyways.
[05:03.41]That's fucking odd, but... And of all the things, that's like one of the...
[05:08.58]Why wouldn't you take... I'm laughing.
[05:11.62]I'm like laughing at that person.
[05:14.72]You don't like laugh at porn.
[05:18.76]What?
[05:19.38]Is it porn?
[05:20.27]Or is it just like a chat with me thing?
[05:22.13]What do you mean you don't?
[05:25.13]That's so fucking funny.
[05:31.77]What do I even do about that though?
[05:33.21]That's the thing, right?
[05:37.22]What the fuck am I supposed to do about that?
[05:39.38]Go get a lawyer?
[05:42.64]Oh, hey, yes, this is Dick and Dick Associates.
[05:45.49]Hey, yeah, it's me, Jerma985.
[05:47.47]Just for the comment, somebody's using my face in a porn ad.
[05:52.01]Do you know what company it is?
[05:53.79]I have no idea.
[05:54.43]They might be overseas.
[05:56.45]Do you have any idea who it is?
[05:58.11]No, I have absolutely no clue.
[05:59.25]Somebody linked it to me in chat.
[06:02.56]Okay, um...
[06:05.68]You know, you're probably better off just... I gotta take another call.
[06:12.42]You want to sue them?
[06:13.16]Yeah!
[06:15.24]Give me the person's name, where they're located, and what the business or country is located in.
[06:19.06]Can't give you any of that.
[06:23.20]They're using my likeness to sell chatting software.
[06:30.84]Unbelievable.
[06:35.22]that's me like way of all the videos to pull why wouldn't you pull one of me talking as if I was talking to you guys you know like we sit here with the facecam on I just talk why would you take the one of me laughing at a baby running into a wall over and over again I've talked to the camera like a thousand times before
[07:00.50]I don't, whatever.
[07:01.25]Re-sit here.
[07:03.11]An item shop's tale.
[07:04.91]This is what we're doing today.
[07:07.91]Hope you had a good 4th of July.
[07:09.07]Those of you that celebrate it.
[07:12.37]We don't need to hear the theme song again.
[07:14.58]Alright, so this is, this should be fun.
[07:16.04]It's a game about buying stocks.
[07:18.44]I'm like stuck on repeat right now.
[07:20.84]New game, here we go.
[07:21.58]Matata.
[07:28.44]Can I skip all this?
[07:29.18]Are you guys going to be mad if I skip the whole thing?
[07:34.01]Oh, for the love of... She's still asleep.
[07:35.99]No.
[07:36.53]No.
[07:36.77]Yes.
[07:37.15]Don't skip it.
[07:37.75]Skip it.
[07:40.01]Why is this Sesame Street music?
[07:46.75]Alright.
[07:47.36]I... I'm going to just... We're going to do it normally.
[07:53.96]I'm not going to skip.
[08:00.78]That was a pretty good fucking fat cloud.
[08:03.04]Does she really not understand how important today is?
[08:05.04]I'm in bed?
[08:07.76]Why am I under the covers like that?
[08:11.11]Merple.
[08:11.95]Can't eat another bite.
[08:13.07]That's my name.
[08:13.71]My name is Resetti.
[08:16.57]Resetti.
[08:17.19]Is it reset?
[08:23.01]But I can always find room for yummy candy.
[08:25.49]Mimble Wurvel.
[08:29.77]I've heard of like mmm or like err or uh, mimble werble.
[08:37.19]Oh, I'm so tired this morning.
[08:39.55]Mimble werble.
[08:44.91]Wake up, please.
[08:45.57]Is that me?
[08:48.60]Whoa, whoa, what is it?
[08:55.60]Oh, tear.
[08:56.58]Good morning.
[08:59.26]We do not have time for good morning, Brissetti.
[09:03.01]Are you planning on spending the rest of your life dreaming of sweets?
[09:06.79]Today is the day we set for opening the store.
[09:09.35]I'm way too excited for this.
[09:12.35]Uh, we did?
[09:12.87]Oh yeah, we did.
[09:16.93]Merde.
[09:19.19]Zero F all this.
[09:21.26]Listen, go wash your face and make yourself presentable.
[09:23.96]And then join me downstairs in the storefront.
[09:27.46]Okay, I'll be right down.
[09:33.95]We need to take care of a few matters before we open officially.
[09:37.41]Everybody settle down for a second, because this game is like actually fun, I've heard.
[09:43.26]Well, I somehow doubt that a store without anything to sell is gonna attract all that much business.
[10:07.74]Oh yeah, we don't have anything to sell.
[10:10.02]So what do we do?
[10:12.62]To start with, we need to establish a stock of items for the store.
[10:17.40]If we have nothing to sell, we cannot claim to be much of a shop.
[10:21.74]That's true.
[10:22.88]So where should we go to get stocked up?
[10:25.97]Let's go get, like, liquor.
[10:28.05]The best way, I think, would be to visit either the town market or the merchant's guild.
[10:32.61]We need to give our regards to the head of the guild regardless.
[10:35.91]So that should probably be our first stop.
[10:39.67]Constant capitalism.
[10:42.17]Oh, that's the place run by that old guy, right?
[10:45.90]We got an old guy.
[10:46.82]Can't wait to do the old guy voice.
[10:49.08]You know it's coming!
[10:50.22]I can't wait to do it.
[10:51.80]The guild operates as a wholesaler for local merchants, so if we stop by, we can purchase an initial stock.
[10:58.12]It would not hurt to Grover.
[11:01.40]It would not hurt Grover.
[11:03.49]Give our polite regards to the guild chief, either.
[11:07.45]Especially since the guild is the organization that allows us to operate here in the first place.
[11:11.73]Why does everybody have a guild?
[11:14.75]Monster Rancher.
[11:15.51]There's a guild.
[11:17.81]Reciteer.
[11:18.47]Guild.
[11:19.61]Who cares about the guild?
[11:24.47]Okay, got it.
[11:24.93]Then let's go right now.
[11:26.11]So we gotta get... Hold on, that person's like a... Why is that person floating off the ground?
[11:30.87]When you want to leave the shop, head to the front door, currently located in the upper right-hand corner of the store.
[11:36.31]But I wanted to leave through the window, like an action hero.
[11:39.94]To infinity.
[11:41.82]And beyond!
[11:42.52]They didn't want to get in trouble for that, apparently.
[11:45.22]Why?
[11:45.46]Brissetti!
[11:48.70]Okay, fine.
[11:54.43]Oh, it's because it actually is like a fairy or something.
[11:59.41]Alright, so here's my store.
[12:01.25]So we have to leave.
[12:01.89]You didn't think there was going to be any action in this game.
[12:04.17]You didn't think there was going to be fucking running T-poses in this game, did you?
[12:10.16]I know it's the easiest thing I could... Alright, there's a lot to do here.
[12:14.46]Alright, so we need to go to the Merchant's Guild.
[12:17.66]This action will not take any time.
[12:19.68]We have 1,000 picks.
[12:23.80]Pictures of what?
[12:28.96]Here comes the old guy.
[12:30.80]Well that is not, well, an incorrect assessment.
[12:36.71]Could I ask that you refrain from calling me a loan shark?
[12:42.07]That's right, mister.
[12:54.61]She and I are partners.
[12:55.45]Don't be mean.
[12:59.84]Forgive me, forgive me.
[13:01.08]Partners it is.
[13:03.22]So, how are the preparations for running that shop coming along?
[13:07.68]Quite well, thank you.
[13:08.88]In fact, we plan on opening today, so we stopped by in order to show our gratitude for your help.
[13:15.74]Very good.
[13:16.26]You two know what's what.
[13:17.88]If you have any problems, let me know.
[13:19.23]I'll be glad to help.
[13:21.22]So you came straight here to pick up some merchandise, right?
[13:25.57]Well, up to the counter then.
[13:26.37]Let's get you two sorted.
[13:28.01]Are those two cigars on him?
[13:29.29]What is that?
[13:30.17]Has he got two cigar holders?
[13:47.80]What's on his chest there?
[13:49.54]Oh, those are clothespins?
[13:50.88]I'm not sure what those are.
[13:53.32]Those are pens.
[13:53.94]Those are fat fucking pens.
[13:58.14]Those are, like, extra large Sharpies.
[14:00.66]Those are not pens.
[14:01.84]Is it the first time?
[14:07.03]Alright, I gotta pay attention to this.
[14:08.13]Our funds are limited, so do not go completely overboard.
[14:10.61]I recommend purchasing no more than ten items.
[14:16.60]buy sell talk alright so we need to stock up on we need to okay so a worn out dented chip sword still better than going into the wild barehanded though 140. a standard lightweight long sword perfect for novices learning the art of swordplay it's 840 bucks
[14:46.02]Alright, I just gotta... Oh shit, there's more.
[14:49.80]We have one item.
[14:52.88]I didn't know there was more bars.
[14:54.83]Hold on, how much are these?
[14:55.71]I recommend 10 items.
[14:59.23]Oh.
[15:01.77]Well, can't I just lie about what the sword is?
[15:04.27]That's how... Come on, that's how capitalism works.
[15:06.16]I'm just gonna, like, make up a story about why this thing is worth so much money.
[15:14.22]Um...
[15:16.53]Rusty dagger.
[15:17.29]I can't even... We can have two items.
[15:20.33]Leather gloves.
[15:22.07]Wait, hold on.
[15:22.61]Clothes.
[15:34.11]Okay.
[15:38.73]Can I sell anything?
[15:41.43]Sell it back to him?
[15:42.43]Hey, we're running our item store here!
[15:45.17]360!
[15:45.19]This guy probably thinks we're like fucking morons.
[15:55.33]What is the guild?
[15:56.11]What can I do here?
[15:56.99]About merchant levels.
[15:59.29]Your merchant level is, well, your ability as a merchant.
[16:02.45]As it goes up, you'll figure out how to redecorate or even expand your store.
[16:07.44]Heck, you might even be able to convince me to let you have a look at some of our more premium items.
[16:12.82]So they got drugs behind the counter.
[16:15.06]You don't put your hands up and say premium with your fingers like that.
[16:19.97]Unless it's something fucking illegal.
[16:23.61]How do you raise your level?
[16:24.25]Simple.
[16:24.53]Buy, sell, trade.
[16:25.77]This is an art and you learn by doing.
[16:27.53]If there's anything you don't know, just ask.
[16:31.38]Okay.
[16:33.92]Let's go sell it.
[16:38.43]Let's go sell that sword.
[16:39.21]Aww, about unknown items.
[16:42.35]Now, if you go dungeon diving, you'll find a lot of stuff which you won't be able to identify at first.
[16:47.92]In particular, I'll bet my hat you'll find a lot of what are commonly called mystery ingredients by the adventurers.
[16:56.10]Yeah, you can go dungeon diving.
[16:58.44]At first you'll probably be tearing your hair out over all the junk you keep finding in those places, but as your merchant level goes up, you'll be able to sort out the stuff you find and pick the best materials and whatnot from the lot.
[17:10.95]Oh, and if you manage to get out of these death traps safely, you'll have time to identify everything safely.
[17:16.08]That means you won't know what you're carrying until you leave.
[17:19.28]Huh, that's interesting.
[17:20.00]Alright, well let's go, let's get out of here.
[17:23.98]I got my merchandise.
[17:28.06]Yep, this is perfect.
[17:30.00]We shall return when our stocks run low again.
[17:34.49]Haha, I'm looking forward to it.
[17:36.51]Here, a little something extra as a startup gift.
[17:41.61]Bread from the ground.
[17:43.25]Half of a donut.
[17:44.01]Walnut bread, thanks a bunch.
[17:47.72]Alright, little lady, give them your all.
[17:51.62]Capitalism, ho!
[17:53.82]Well, Adam Sandler would be proud of us at any rate.
[17:56.34]Alright, we're going to go back to Recettear.
[18:05.85]Very well, it's time to give you a crash course on the basics of running an item shop.
[18:10.79]I'm so excited, and I don't know why.
[18:12.51]I was supposed to just relax today.
[18:14.73]Okay, what do I do first?
[18:16.77]First, we need to put some items on display.
[18:18.89]If we do not have our goods out for people to see, we can hardly expect the customers to buy them after all.
[18:26.43]So you need to get near these counters.
[18:29.33]Just so, once you know where you wish to place something, choose what you wish to place in that spot by pressing the primary button.
[18:36.47]primary button?
[18:39.47]You will understand when you try it.
[18:40.65]Trust me.
[18:41.01]Now remember, what you place will affect how people perceive the store.
[18:45.06]So think carefully before you place something.
[18:46.52]Okay.
[18:49.60]Why not line up what we purchased on one of the counters?
[18:56.15]Okay.
[18:57.77]So I have long sword and clothes.
[19:01.79]Long sword has to be right here.
[19:04.63]Yeah.
[19:05.31]Base price, 1200 bucks.
[19:10.07]That's the item that people are going to be coming in.
[19:11.67]And that's the one that lags your game.
[19:15.65]Alright, maybe in the back wall here?
[19:17.21]Do it by the window.
[19:20.16]No, I don't want to sell the bread.
[19:25.26]I'm already getting... I'm already getting talked to.
[19:33.59]Uh, may I speak with you a moment?
[19:36.35]What is it?
[19:36.79]What?
[19:37.03]Uh, those counters by the window, um, items you place there are visible to anyone passing by on the street.
[19:44.19]As such, putting eye-catching items, the sort of thing that makes you think, I want to buy this more than anything, on those counters is a core principle of running a shop.
[19:53.52]In a very real way, those counters are the face of the shop.
[19:57.08]And what is placed there greatly affects interest in our business.
[20:00.82]So choose what to place there very...
[20:03.34]Very carefully.
[20:06.17]Wow, I never thought about like that before.
[20:08.15]Okay, I'll be careful.
[20:15.85]So then... How do I pick it up?
[20:19.55]Okay.
[20:21.88]I'm gonna put... Oh, she likes the sword.
[20:26.50]Look, you can use that sword to cut that bread.
[20:29.64]I got it up here.
[20:32.73]I'll put the clothes over here.
[20:36.41]This is a window.
[20:38.03]Can I talk to you for a minute?
[20:44.58]You probably shouldn't cough near the bread.
[20:47.68]I mean, you can, but we're gonna have to put a mask on you.
[20:54.63]Are you sure it doesn't look dumb?
[20:59.21]Do not worry, everything looks good enough for a first attempt.
[21:02.13]Now I need to teach you how to actually sell things.
[21:04.77]Please go sit at the counter.
[21:10.71]Oh, you're talking to me!
[21:11.91]You're talking about me!
[21:12.97]Alright, here they come.
[21:17.25]Well, then the items are in place and now you need to learn how to actually sell things to people without embarrassing yourself.
[21:24.37]Dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun dun!
[21:27.01]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[21:29.41]Super Mario 3D World!
[21:34.36]What do I... Alright, right.
[21:36.12]Um, actually, sell things... Right.
[21:41.28]Oh, Kai-Oh!
[21:42.90]So to start with, I will lecture on the actual process of selling an item we have displayed.
[21:48.04]Dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun-dun!
[21:56.49]I can't pay attention.
[21:59.95]Alright.
[22:01.46]If the students do not listen, they do not get any credit.
[22:04.82]Right, right, right.
[22:05.58]Now then.
[22:06.42]When a customer enters, be sure to greet them with a nice big welcome.
[22:14.67]Welcome!
[22:16.97]Could I get this, please?
[22:17.75]Uh, um, uh, um...
[22:41.16]I don't know.
[22:41.72]Let me think about that.
[22:42.55]I'm a store and I have things that people pay me to give them.
[22:47.23]I don't know.
[22:48.87]What they want will be in the target window.
[22:53.23]You will also be able to see the name and the base price.
[22:57.69]Pay close attention to that base price.
[23:00.46]Also, if you press button three, you can view expanded.
[23:03.64]Well, what's that on an Xbox?
[23:08.49]Consult the Custom.exe program included with Recetir if you wish to check or alter your button configuration.
[23:19.45]Wait, Button 3, Custom.exe?
[23:23.03]Focus!
[23:24.07]Your life is hard enough to control as it is.
[23:25.81]Uh, okay.
[23:28.56]Now, the next you must decide what price you wish to offer.
[23:31.40]In general, you want to try and name a price higher than the base.
[23:34.78]Try naming a price, if you will.
[23:37.76]Uh, let's see.
[23:40.66]You likely noticed that the base price serves as your default.
[23:43.72]To raise your offer, press up.
[23:46.40]Press up.
[23:48.38]Okay, is this an android?
[23:51.31]Learning how to do things as a pro- I don't understand.
[23:56.35]That's not gonna happen.
[24:01.04]Alright, let's do, uh... What?
[24:05.74]116% of base price, 1500.
[24:08.08]Can you imagine?
[24:28.18]Is that gonna work?
[24:29.46]A fair price!
[24:32.75]Hold on, hold on.
[24:38.30]Oh shit, I get... How do I get this off?
[24:49.63]Um... I can't put that on zero.
[25:00.49]There we... Alright, I got it, I got it, I got it.
[25:09.04]All I need is one person to buy that.
[25:12.10]And I'll be good.
[25:14.95]Okay.
[25:18.39]I'm going to say $13.50.
[25:24.11]Very good.
[25:24.53]That is how you adjust your offer.
[25:25.67]This might be obvious if a customer is satisfied with your offer.
[25:32.22]It is a sale and you get a little bit of experience along with the money.
[25:37.15]your price is too high however a customer can simply walk out learning to determine the proper price there lies the challenge now if a customer disagrees with the price but not so much that they want to storm out then you can negotiate remember what I said about comfort earlier that is the key here offer a price but do not make it so outrageous that the customer feels you are not acting in good faith 112 is fine
[26:01.69]if they disagree but stay offer them a new price ideally you will lower your offer a little and they will take it and give you a sale some customers may just be trying to sniff out a better price when they're really willing to pay your initial price however whether or not you risk testing that possibility is up to you how long can you well that depends on how long can you keep haggling depends on how regular a customer the person in the question is
[26:27.22]As we're starting out, you will not be able to haggle for very long.
[26:31.42]But after customers begin to trust us a little, you can haggle for a longer period of time.
[26:37.47]Well, time to put the theory into practice.
[26:39.75]Um, okay.
[26:42.29]Why isn't... Why aren't you the boss and you the fairy?
[26:48.60]If I'm the manager, I come in and I switch them.
[26:50.44]I say, you put the wings on and you go stay behind that counter.
[26:53.06]This is like fucking stupid.
[26:56.14]Juno Upsetto just gave 10 community subs.
[26:57.82]Thank you.
[27:03.83]Thanks for the 10 community subs.
[27:07.63]Much love to you.
[27:09.55]Could I get this, please?
[27:11.96]Ooh, okay.
[27:12.74]I pick a price, right?
[27:14.24]Needs to be higher than the base up button.
[27:16.56]Uh...
[27:24.79]Customer will likely buy immediately.
[27:26.19]Now for the fine art of haggling.
[27:29.14]Theoretically, what you wish to do is lower your price slowly.
[27:32.68]But as I mentioned, there is a limit to how long you can haggle.
[27:36.36]The idea is to deduce a customer's desired price and go from there.
[27:40.45]You say deduce the desired price, but how do I... A large number of stores sell at about 30% over base price. 30%?! !
[27:50.79]It is not a hard and fast rule, but people will usually accept that price level.
[27:54.85]Usually.
[27:56.33]If you can manage to go over that, you will make a lot of money.
[27:59.55]But you do not want to risk driving away a customer.
[28:01.69]Alright then, so as a customer, I am haggling.
[28:06.33]Could you make it a little bit cheaper?
[28:08.97]Okay.
[28:12.15]Oh, shit.
[28:22.52]You want to cheat by one cent.
[28:26.62]Alright, here we go.
[28:28.10]If you can sell me an item, you'll be ready for what lies ahead.
[28:30.82]This is the true mentor and student.
[28:33.79]Come here.
[28:34.47]Hey.
[28:35.11]What's that, like, the famous one?
[28:37.35]Like, sell me this.
[28:39.05]Sell me this pen, right?
[28:41.05]Doesn't somebody do that?
[28:45.77]Yeah.
[28:47.85]It's in a movie or something.
[28:50.13]Alright.
[28:51.59]Let's begin.
[28:55.77]Hello!
[28:56.35]Welcome to Reseteer!
[28:58.55]I would like to buy this, please!
[29:00.01]Steel... I don't have one of those.
[29:03.59]Well, what happens now is... Sorry, you have to go... This is a... You have to go to Target, because they're all out at Walmart.
[29:10.41]So, you have to go down the street.
[29:11.79]Sorry.
[29:12.17]Alright, so how about... 30%, right?
[29:17.13]Let's be... I'm not doing that number.
[29:19.17]Let's do, like... 4150.
[29:23.90]Hmm, could you a little lower, perhaps?
[29:26.52]Eh, I guess so.
[29:27.59]I like you.
[29:28.23]You're smart, you're fun, you're cool.
[29:30.85]You come in here all the time, and you always got good coffee where you are.
[29:36.83]Yeah, that sounds fine.
[29:38.35]A little bit lower?
[29:39.07]I don't think so.
[29:40.74]I don't think so.
[29:42.30]I'm doing you a favor here.
[29:43.66]You know how rare these steel swords are?
[29:46.12]You know how hard it is to get these?
[29:47.74]I had to go dungeon dumpster diving to find this.
[29:52.15]Alright, alright, you know, I like you, I like you.
[29:56.95]You know how fucking stupid this is?
[30:00.68]Can we just take a quick break to just talk about how dumb this shit is?
[30:06.04]This is what happens everywhere.
[30:09.26]Why can't you just sell me a product that is like, why do we have to do this?
[30:15.98]You do this shit when you buy a car, too.
[30:17.96]How much is your car?
[30:20.06]$20,000.
[30:20.43]No, it isn't.
[30:21.63]How much is the car for real?
[30:23.77]It's actually $17,000.
[30:25.01]No, it's not.
[30:26.01]What do you want from that car?
[30:27.31]You know, $15,000 is what we want to sell this car for.
[30:29.02]Okay.
[30:35.12]Cool.
[30:35.96]Can I have the car for $15,000?
[30:37.06]Well, I mean... I mean, well, I don't think so.
[30:41.74]You see, because the car costs like $9,000 to make.
[30:45.36]And... Why do we do this?
[30:50.59]Just sell it.
[30:51.19]I lost.
[31:06.86]Why do we do this to ourselves?
[31:10.34]There's no reason to do this.
[31:18.47]Okay, you know what?
[31:19.17]I like you.
[31:20.27]We're gonna start at 3800.
[31:21.01]So, he's a... Oh, he's a communist.
[31:24.52]No, no, no, I'm just saying.
[31:32.28]I want to buy a product.
[31:33.72]If you want to sell me a product, put a fucking price tag on it and sell it to me.
[31:38.50]Why do we have to have like a three and a half hour long back and forth where you tell me your life story so I pay more money for the car than it actually is worth?
[31:48.39]There's a price tag on the car.
[31:51.29]There's a price tag on the car.
[31:54.61]Why not just have no price tag and just say, hey, come on in and let's chat.
[32:00.33]Why is there a price on the car?
[32:07.87]Oh, I did it.
[32:12.43]Cut his mic.
[32:13.63]If a car is $15,000 and you want to sell it for $15,000 and you have a price tag on the car for $15,000, that's what the car should be.
[32:23.26]You shouldn't put a fake price tag on the car until the customer comes in and says, well, that's fucked up.
[32:28.38]I know it's wicked fucked up.
[32:31.21]It's actually $12,000.
[32:31.69]Have a good day.
[32:33.29]What?
[32:34.31]What?
[32:40.26]Oh, we can do another... I would like this, please.
[32:42.62]Alright, sure thing.
[32:44.94]We did $3,800 last time.
[32:46.04]Let's do $30.
[32:46.74]Let's get daring here.
[32:48.26]A little lower.
[32:50.25]A little lower.
[32:54.31]Okay, this is my final offer.
[32:56.43]I sold a steel sword for $3,750.
[33:03.07]Picks.
[33:10.70]If I want to practice again, let me know.
[33:13.92]Anytime we're in the shop.
[33:15.45]Okay.
[33:19.83]I did it.
[33:20.89]And that is essentially how it goes.
[33:22.37]You are quite good for someone who has never done this before.
[33:26.57]And has asked so many questions.
[33:28.63]And was essentially just parroting every sentence I said.
[33:32.31]And not really learning anything.
[33:38.29]We still have a little bit of time left today, so let us go ahead and open the store proper.
[33:41.97]If anyone comes in, simply handle them in the same way that we just practiced.
[33:46.91]Whoa, are you sure it'll be okay?
[33:49.15]Do not worry, as the saying goes, salesmanship is more of an art than it is a science.
[33:55.65]We're just fucking around all the time.
[33:57.95]It's not about selling products, it's just, it's an art now.
[34:00.59]Give me a paintbrush and let's, like, fucking make money.
[34:04.79]Now then, I'll open us up, go and sit at the counter.
[34:13.29]Oh, here we go.
[34:16.17]Welcome.
[34:16.79]Looking for something.
[34:17.71]Looking for something specific.
[34:20.62]This, please.
[34:21.18]Bread.
[34:21.48]100 bucks.
[34:23.46]Ooh.
[34:25.16]Well.
[34:26.62]There's a bread shortage.
[34:32.31]In Texas right now so, you know, I mean, you know, we get our bread from Massachusetts, so it doesn't affect us at all Glee I sold walnut bread for a one one zero What a scam Oh
[35:02.06]Congratulations, you did well.
[35:04.27]I... I scammed that lady.
[35:06.93]I... Me?
[35:08.21]Rosetta?
[35:08.85]I... I scammed that fucking old lady?
[35:11.03]Oh my... I... I did it.
[35:13.42]I... I'm so happy.
[35:17.08]I did it.
[35:18.96]I did it.
[35:19.54]I took something from somewhere for way less money and put it in front of somebody else and lied to them and doubled my money.
[35:30.47]I actually did it.
[35:33.65]Papa, I did it.
[35:49.90]Look, I'm not against capitalism.
[35:52.13]I trade goddamn stocks and cryptocurrency.
[35:58.35]Do you think I'm against capitalism?
[35:59.55]No, I'm against fucking bullshit capitalism.
[36:18.11]Crypto.
[36:18.61]Hey, we don't make fun of crypto here.
[36:29.96]Crypto is... You are describing like it's the bullshit.
[36:41.32]No, I'm not.
[36:45.89]Look.
[36:47.77]If somebody wants to buy whatever the... I'm... I'm just... As an outside perspective, I'm just making statements.
[36:54.96]That's it.
[36:56.38]I'm not saying we gotta do this.
[36:57.40]I'm just... I'm just making statements.
[37:02.79]It's been three months since Papa left.
[37:16.26]I don't get why he suddenly said, I'm gonna go be a hero.
[37:23.14]And then took off without saying when he'd be back.
[37:27.86]I really hope he's okay.
[37:28.90]I'm getting lonely.
[37:32.45]What the fuck is going on right now?
[37:36.27]Well, I shouldn't worry too much about him.
[37:37.71]The best thing about him is how tough he is.
[37:39.63]He'll be okay.
[37:40.27]Dad?
[37:40.35]Dad?
[37:45.19]Is that a burp?
[37:49.79]Papa?
[37:51.09]Wouldn't knock.
[37:51.77]Who is that?
[37:54.47]Who is it?
[37:54.89]There's nobody there!
[38:00.80]Wait, what's at my feet here?
[38:04.38]Good evening.
[38:07.59]You are Mademoiselle Reset Lemongrass.
[38:12.09]Um, Miss Fairy?
[38:14.15]Pardon me, but I am the one asking the questions.
[38:17.35]Again, you are Resetti Lemongrass?
[38:21.13]Um, yes, I'm Resett.
[38:23.72]My name is Tyr.
[38:24.64]I'm an agent of the Term Finance Company.
[38:29.00]Finance Company?
[38:31.66]I'm here to collect payment on a loan paid out to your father.
[38:35.48]Here is the contract and my identification.
[38:39.45]Um...
[38:41.58]Loan repayment.
[38:44.90]In plainer terms, I'm here to get our money back.
[38:46.86]And another thing about loans!
[38:49.17]Let's talk about fucking loans!
[38:50.91]And how they... If you are incapable of facilitating repayment, this house will be seized as collateral in order to repay the loan. ...
[39:08.42]I'm telling you, this person doesn't even know anything.
[39:12.76]Facilitating?
[39:14.44]Collateral?
[39:15.36]Huh?
[39:19.80]Seize?
[39:21.28]What?
[39:29.20]Papa?
[39:30.56]Papa isn't... He's not here.
[39:32.52]Yes, I see that now.
[39:36.62]Uh...
[39:39.70]Monsieur Lemongrass disappeared following a fracas atop the local volcano, so we assumed he might have returned here.
[39:52.16]Even if he has not, however, the contract covers this eventuality.
[39:57.40]Covers this?
[39:59.20]Quite, as the so- I'm not even going to read her lines anymore.
[40:02.82]Quite, as the sole remaining member of his household, we shall require that you pay his debts in his stead.
[40:12.05]I barely have enough money to live by myself.
[40:14.33]Naturally, we're not demanding it all be repaid at once.
[40:17.75]There's still a small amount of time before any payment is due.
[40:20.91]Therefore... Am I gonna get sold off in parts to distant foreign lands to repay Papa's debts?
[40:30.19]I wonder if I can survive with only two internal organs.
[40:35.21]Listen to me.
[41:06.80]Ahem.
[41:07.60]Please listen to me for a moment.
[41:09.40]I have no clue where you're getting these ludicrous ideas from.
[41:12.50]But I would never do such a thing.
[41:13.90]Quite the opposite, in fact.
[41:15.58]I was sent here to ensure that you wouldn't have to resort to such well-absurd methods to pay us back.
[41:21.35]Instead, let me give you a different solution.
[41:25.47]Work for us for the rest of your life.
[41:28.61]Ten to twelve hours a day.
[41:31.58]Paying slowly back.
[41:33.20]Until you're eighty.
[41:37.85]I've been sent to support you to the fullest of my ability.
[41:40.95]So that you may repay the debt via labor.
[41:45.73]Wait, what?
[41:47.49]But I've never worked a single day in my life.
[41:50.49]Experience is no work experience.
[41:58.28]All that matters is whether or not you are willing to work.
[42:03.94]That was not the kind of
[42:06.56]A response that I would have assumed would happen from that.
[42:10.46]Why would you just go, Oh!
[42:14.94]If you do not wish to work, then that is that.
[42:17.02]The house is mine.
[42:20.32]And I will have to ask you to leave the premises.
[42:23.38]As the saying goes, those who do not work, do not eat.
[42:27.06]So, Miss Lemongrass, which will it be?
[42:28.64]Work or the house?
[42:29.32]You guys remember Happy Gilmore?
[42:37.13]His grandfather built that fucking house with his bare hands.
[42:44.64]And then that dickhead comes along, that golf pro, trying to, like, buy it up at auction.
[42:48.46]Spoilers, by the way, for Happy Gilmore.
[43:02.05]What can I even do?
[43:02.87]I already have an idea.
[43:04.53]This is the backstory.
[43:07.25]The city is an adventuring hub.
[43:08.49]In addition, this house space is out onto one of the main city lanes.
[43:12.20]Therefore, I propose converting this house into a store.
[43:15.08]I would be like, take the fucking house, you cold-hearted piece of shit.
[43:23.21]So you already own the store.
[43:25.35]Just take the house.
[43:34.30]Well, we won't take your house.
[43:35.24]We'll just turn it into our house, but you can still sleep here.
[43:47.87]Just squish the fairy.
[43:50.13]Yeah, dude, like, come on.
[43:52.81]I can't turn the webcam on, but I kind of have to.
[43:55.79]Hold on, just listen to the Sesame Street music for a second.
[44:00.47]This is important.
[44:28.83]Alright, so, yeah, what's stopping you from doing something like this?
[44:33.26]You know, she's saying all these things like, oh, yeah, we're going to, like, own your house, and, oh, yeah, your father is a fucking adventurer.
[44:40.50]Just like... Yeah, oh, yeah, go ahead, tell me.
[44:46.55]Father was...
[44:59.79]He's not that small.
[45:11.82]How do you know?
[45:17.24]She'd survive.
[45:20.08]You don't know that.
[45:23.56]Did I lose my... Why did I lose this?
[45:31.09]I was only gone for a little while to do market research.
[45:38.75]Where could she have gone?
[45:39.88]I'm like sleeping under the covers.
[45:43.38]Like fucking sad.
[45:48.40]All I did was threaten to take away everything she ever knew and loved.
[45:51.36]Asking her to turn the house into an item shop was foolish.
[45:54.72]Even if it was to repay the debt.
[45:57.78]The poor girl must be terribly confused.
[45:59.52]And on top of that, her father is probably woof.
[46:01.62]Uh-oh.
[46:04.70]Wait!
[46:05.86]What's going on?
[46:06.38]Why is the house being filled with like... Yayness, it's done.
[46:14.39]Hey Tyr, look, it's done.
[46:18.41]What is that?
[46:19.67]Oh, it's our shop sign, of course.
[46:21.21]Doesn't it look cool?
[46:23.60]But it's on the ground.
[46:25.98]Oh, of course it's on the ground.
[46:27.26]Isn't that interesting how it's on the ground?
[46:30.21]What would be under the ground here?
[46:32.75]What are you doing?
[46:34.25]Oh, you know, just... It's your grave!
[46:46.76]You can't be a shop without one of these, you know.
[46:52.27]Yes, well, it's quite ma- well made.
[46:54.01]Hee hee, see, oh, by the way, before I started, uh, I need to make this really clear.
[47:02.03]Before the stream started, I was in chat, and we were just talking, and, like, talking about stuff, and having fun, and chilling, and stuff.
[47:08.20]I wrote, ha ha ha, and everybody mocked me for doing it.
[47:14.18]And I realized that I can no longer write, like, hee hee, or, like, ha ha, in text anymore.
[47:21.43]Because it's seen as like weird, ironic, fake, like laughing.
[47:28.43]I can't write, you cannot write H-A-H-A-H-A ever again.
[47:32.41]You have to do an emote now.
[47:38.03]It's seen as like a Kappa.
[47:39.55]Ha ha ha ha, oh yeah, ha ha ha, yeah, funny, right?
[47:43.94]No, no, I actually thought that was funny.
[47:45.72]Well, do, write emote then.
[47:51.65]Be that as it may, while the sign is nice, I... Is there a problem?
[47:56.90]Well, the name.
[47:57.68]You're quite sure that you have thought that through?
[48:03.40]Well, we're partners, right?
[48:04.78]You said so.
[48:06.67]So, put reset and tear together and... Reciteer!
[48:14.69]Isn't it neat?
[48:16.72]Well, that is to say the sentiment is commendable, but...
[48:22.00]It's the two of us opening the store.
[48:24.22]So the name should reflect that, right?
[48:26.44]You don't like it?
[48:28.00]Really, it's not that, but well... Okay, Arisa Tyr.
[48:33.62]That's awful.
[48:39.39]Why would you put Tyr in there?
[48:41.75]There's no reason for that.
[48:43.71]Mispronounce it even slightly and...
[48:47.00]Re-ket-tier.
[48:48.84]Racket.
[48:49.68]Racketeer.
[48:51.84]This job is going to be even more absurdly difficult than I originally suspected, I fear.
[48:59.79]And so, a fairy suddenly entered my life.
[49:03.87]One thing was for sure, this sure wasn't going to be dull. ...
[49:18.51]How is it possible to sleep this much each day?
[49:20.37]How?
[49:27.54]Tear.
[49:30.42]Let's do the very best we can.
[49:31.76]Resetti!
[49:37.08]Wake up, please!
[49:39.92]What?
[49:40.34]Who's on first?
[49:42.73]That's a boomer joke.
[49:43.93]That's a super boomer joke.
[49:46.86]That's so boomer.
[49:48.12]That's such a boomer joke.
[49:49.64]That shit's in black and white.
[49:52.18]That's how old that joke is.
[49:54.76]I think it's funny.
[49:58.39]The clock does not have a good morning hand.
[50:00.33]Wait, didn't we already do this?
[50:02.33]You're the proprietor of an item shop.
[50:05.11]You must learn to be responsible and not sleep the day away.
[50:10.78]Right, right, right, right.
[50:11.68]Okay.
[50:12.06]Well, why in the name of heaven are you smiling so much?
[50:14.04]The smile you have while sleeping is just getting bigger.
[50:17.10]Oh, no reason.
[50:18.18]I just think I saw something nice in my dreams.
[50:20.81]Here, let's give it our all.
[50:22.95]Well, if you really are dedicated to making this work, wash yourself and meet me downstairs.
[50:29.21]Will do.
[50:29.63]Can I play?
[50:31.23]Can I fucking play?
[50:38.06]So, I have an item shop and stuff, and it's all cool and awesome.
[50:42.26]So, uh, what do I do now?
[50:44.55]That's up to your judgment.
[50:45.90]If you sit at the counter, we can open immediately.
[50:48.74]Or we can reorganize the shop, or we can even go search for new stock around town or elsewhere.
[50:55.72]Yikes, that's a ton of options.
[50:57.00]How do I choose?
[50:59.12]It is as I said earlier, running a place like this is more of an art than it is something you can simply follow a map through.
[51:04.96]Simply pick something, we will deal with what comes.
[51:08.10]Okay.
[51:11.13]Welcome to Recettear.
[51:16.88]Alright, I have 130 bucks.
[51:18.58]How long is the day?
[51:19.16]Day 2.
[51:22.10]How much money do I have?
[51:22.80]Not enough.
[51:23.12]I need to sell this thing.
[51:25.04]I gotta sell the sword.
[51:27.51]Let's do it.
[51:28.81]Open this door.
[51:35.29]Wait, hold on.
[51:37.81]Town Square Pub.
[51:40.66]Chapel?
[51:41.22]Adventurer's Guild.
[51:44.18]I mean, it's blinking.
[51:47.34]This shit's blinking.
[51:51.60]Hey, what's this place?
[51:53.62]This is the Adventurer's Guild.
[51:55.02]The guild manages expeditions to various untamed wilderness areas that have been ruined in the city.
[51:59.30]The areas commonly referred to as dungeons.
[52:00.95]Without approval, adventurers cannot visit the dungeons.
[52:02.85]You have to get approved.
[52:04.27]Ah, we can't just go into the dungeon and pick up everything.
[52:06.43]Ah, what the heck?
[52:08.09]We could get a ton of profit and shit.
[52:09.43]It's still a very good idea.
[52:10.73]A great many people have made that.
[52:11.73]You can go into the dungeon and get stuff and collect it and sell it, but you have to identify it.
[52:15.19]We must first hire an adventurer.
[52:19.93]Can I just pick anybody?
[52:21.95]The truth of the matter is a bit more complicated.
[52:23.65]Even if you pay them, few adventurers are willing to risk their lives simply for the benefit of a complete stranger.
[52:29.39]Oh, so they turn away people when they don't know of her.
[52:32.29]Yes.
[52:33.94]Get to know a few adventurers and build up a certain level of trust with them.
[52:37.92]If all goes well, they will give you a symbol of their guild membership.
[52:40.94]This usually takes the form of a card.
[52:43.54]With that in hand, we can bring an adventurer with us.
[52:47.37]So it's like they're inviting us to a dinner party.
[52:49.25]No, you're going into a dungeon where you might both die.
[52:54.88]See?
[52:58.18]Attempting to rip you limb from... I said it first.
[53:01.82]But the analogy does work somewhat.
[53:04.01]Right, so first I need to meet adventurer.
[53:05.49]Where do you meet adventurers?
[53:06.75]At the bar.
[53:08.99]After all, we run an item shop.
[53:10.23]We should get a few coming in as clients on a fairly regular basis.
[53:12.93]Alright, we're going to sell that sword to somebody.
[53:17.56]Let's go get a dinner invitation.
[53:18.84]Indeed, just be careful that reset is not on the menu.
[53:23.74]Huh?
[53:25.04]Is something wrong?
[53:26.52]Well, that guy over there.
[53:31.98]Listen to me.
[53:33.38]If I can't work, I can't get the money.
[53:35.66]And if I can't get the money, I can't get the items.
[53:38.80]And if I can't get the items, apparently I can't work.
[53:43.18]Heaven, if I had a few things, I could at least visit the Hall of Trials.
[53:49.83]Oh, I wonder what's going on.
[53:52.45]He seems to be a rookie adventurer complaining about his inability to complete the required guild test.
[53:56.86]Oh, a test?
[53:57.34]It is a guild test?
[53:58.58]The guild hardly allows anyone off the street.
[54:01.12]You can only work officially with the guild after passing tears at an item shop.
[54:04.20]Owner is hardly the only... Every episode of every single one of these I've ever watched.
[54:08.26]I have an idea.
[54:14.29]Sorry, I do believe we have found our first adventurer.
[54:19.26]Wait, what do you mean by, uh, tier weight?
[54:25.98]Son of a... I burned what cash I had just getting to the city.
[54:29.86]If I can't get into the guild, I don't know what I'll even do for dinner money.
[54:33.76]Now I'm hungry, great.
[54:38.65]Excuse me.
[54:39.65]Pardon me a moment.
[54:40.53]You there, adventurer with the seedy look.
[54:44.09]Who you calling seedy?
[54:49.91]Well, you two would be, uh... We're a pair of merchants who happen to be passing.
[54:54.81]Merchants?
[54:55.47]Oh, you heard me talking.
[54:57.49]Sorry, but I'm way too broke and seedy to buy anything.
[55:02.88]Believe me, I could tell by your seedy nature that your attempting to sell you anything would be a colossal waste of time.
[55:10.46]Come on, Tyr, stop with the seedy already.
[55:12.84]He isn't a plant.
[55:17.12]-2, by the way.
[55:18.96]So are you two going to prune me or what here?
[55:23.74]Would you like it if we came with you to the Hall of Trials?
[55:26.39]If you require equipment or items, we can provide them.
[55:30.05]I'd call you a pair of angels then, but why?
[55:35.65]Business naturally.
[55:36.57]We help you pass the trial.
[55:37.87]You provide us with your card.
[55:40.33]Oh, I get it.
[55:41.45]We help Mr. Swordsman clear the dungeon, and then he gives us his card, a sign of our eternal friendship.
[55:51.77]Dumb.
[55:53.11]Very dumb.
[55:55.78]Eternal friendship is rather irrelevant in this case, but it does work out neatly for all of us.
[56:00.36]What do you say?
[56:02.90]I see.
[56:03.46]You guys are pretty new at all this, too, huh?
[56:06.56]Oh, that was... I did that one pretty... I phoned that part.
[56:09.25]That was a phoned-in line.
[56:11.21]I'll offer, Mr. Swordsman, yes or no.
[56:17.97]That wasn't me.
[56:20.53]I swear, that was in the game.
[56:22.94]Alright, then.
[56:23.46]Heck, I got nothing to lose.
[56:24.68]Well, aside from my precious life, anyway.
[56:27.78]Yayifications.
[56:29.72]Glad to meet you two.
[56:32.08]I'm Reset.
[56:32.66]Nice to meet you.
[56:33.22]What's your name?
[56:36.47]Alright, I'll be waiting here.
[56:38.06]Alright, so now... we have to go to the... we have to go get... food.
[57:12.56]Um, the apple is a bit sour, so it's best used in jam or a pie.
[57:19.08]Um, these are too much money.
[57:20.38]I can buy bread.
[57:23.00]This town staple snack, walnuts, soft dough, and a bit of sugar make it perfect.
[57:28.56]I guess I can just buy two breads.
[57:33.92]One bread.
[57:37.10]Can I, like, chase down the lady I sold the bread to?
[57:44.55]Alright, will he live off of one bread?
[57:51.73]He's got a worn sword, leather armor, wooden shield, old muffler!
[57:55.79]Why does he have a muffler on?
[58:00.00]Use his sword?
[58:00.60]Okay, leave.
[58:01.78]Level 1, Swordsman Louie.
[58:07.46]Pick the items you wish to bring with you when finished, like the depart option.
[58:13.83]We got one bread.
[58:15.07]Let's go.
[58:16.93]The Hall of Trials.
[58:22.62]So this is the dungeon.
[58:24.32]Just so, welcome to the jungle, as they say.
[58:27.08]And another hour-long tutorial on how to control in combat.
[58:33.18]I'm not a monster slayer, I'm scared.
[58:35.36]The two of us are perfectly safe.
[58:36.80]There's a protective field around the two of us.
[58:39.09]To the monsters, we may as well be invisible.
[58:42.19]So why are you on screen?
[58:45.63]You could have just not put them on screen.
[58:48.45]You could have just sent this guy down.
[58:52.19]Louie is perfectly safe too, then.
[58:54.53]No, not quite, actually.
[58:57.70]Well, if Louie is... You know, Louie could see some problems in the next few minutes.
[59:04.24]We don't have to worry, but this is accomplished by making us virtually intangible to everything inside this place.
[59:08.12]We can directly manipulate nothing.
[59:10.90]We can't collect things.
[59:11.80]Why are we in here?
[59:15.48]That's why our adventurer remains outside the field.
[59:19.88]So this guy picks up stuff.
[59:21.14]Should our adventurer be injured, we can place him in the field and retreat.
[59:25.86]Since we must carry him back, however, we can take very little else with us.
[59:29.43]One item at most.
[59:31.97]So even if we run into trouble, we don't lose everything.
[59:34.43]But wait, I thought you said we can't.
[59:36.89]Yes, I will elaborate further if need be later.
[59:38.57]I'm not going to press that button.
[59:42.23]We can bring as much as our bags will allow us to carry if we get out safely.
[59:47.82]Cool.
[59:48.08]Wait.
[59:48.32]As much as our bags will allow.
[59:49.66]Well, you have bags, too.
[59:52.34]Yep.
[59:53.16]Yep.
[59:53.82]The adventurers focus on adventuring while we keep track of what to loot.
[59:56.64]You got it.
[59:57.88]Cool.
[59:58.86]K.O.
[59:59.36]Day.
[59:59.79]Let's get karate.
[60:03.37]Equip items in bag.
[60:04.35]Uh...
[60:10.81]Alright, I just used SP.
[60:18.52]Slime!
[60:22.12]Is this money?
[60:23.34]Where are these items?
[60:32.29]This would be more tolerable if you muted.
[60:34.93]Why would I mute this?
[60:43.21]What is it?
[60:43.87]Something in here.
[60:44.45]Ooh!
[60:46.35]Crafter's knife.
[60:47.21]That'll be a pretty penny, I think.
[60:53.29]Is it goo?
[60:53.77]What is it?
[60:54.29]Can I pick it up?
[60:55.90]Slime fluid.
[60:59.78]Missed it.
[61:00.10]I got it, I got it!
[61:00.66]Ooh, he's dead!
[61:04.78]Oh!
[61:11.59]Is there a dodge roll?
[61:12.27]If there's a dodge roll, this is gonna be... She just gets, like, upset.
[61:19.10]Every time he gets hit, I just hear, like, Oh, no!
[61:23.19]Uh-oh.
[61:27.47]There's a trap.
[61:37.97]That was a crit.
[61:39.39]There's crits in this game?
[61:41.55]Pretty cool.
[61:44.83]So does he level up down here?
[61:52.80]Term of the crits.
[61:56.18]Yes.
[61:56.88]Ooh.
[62:00.42]Should I stand?
[62:00.74]I don't know if I want to stand on this.
[62:02.74]Not yet.
[62:04.74]Is there a run or a sprint or a dash?
[62:09.19]I don't think so.
[62:16.49]Chest.
[62:16.69]How much room in our bags do we have?
[62:19.09]Some are sandals.
[62:19.83]I don't think I'm gonna be able to sell this stuff.
[62:23.47]And then I'm gonna be... Ooh, this is how it begins.
[62:51.76]I got 11 SP.
[62:53.22]Level 3!
[62:57.24]Oh, they get these random traps?
[63:05.31]Alright, let's keep going.
[63:21.33]Go to the next floor, yes.
[63:22.23]Alright, red slimes.
[63:29.38]They're more aggressive.
[63:30.16]This is going to be so hard.
[63:34.50]I can't believe this is going to be the hardest fucking game ever.
[63:38.40]Ladle.
[63:39.54]A backscratcher.
[63:40.52]I'm going to sell that for like five grand.
[63:46.37]It's like the mines in Stardew.
[63:47.83]Yeah, that's what it reminds me of.
[63:53.39]How do I look in my backpack?
[63:54.43]Is there a way to see in my backpack?
[64:00.56]I don't think so.
[64:01.74]I don't have a way to look in my sack.
[64:13.10]Why would there just be rocks?
[64:15.52]I don't have like a dodge roll.
[64:24.48]No, I don't want any of this.
[64:25.16]There's probably all kinds of, like, treasures.
[64:28.64]He's gonna die to the rocks.
[64:29.84]I don't think... I don't think it's possible for me to die down here.
[64:33.39]Ooh, what's that?
[64:33.93]Walnut bread times two.
[64:38.61]Well, I'm glad I did this because I'm gonna have a ton of inventory for the store.
[64:40.93]Oh, it was a trap.
[64:53.54]More bread.
[64:54.04]Yeah, I can sell it.
[65:00.62]How do you take an item?
[65:05.92]I don't know what you said.
[65:11.35]New enemy type.
[65:15.31]Is it a bad guy?
[65:19.25]I don't know.
[65:19.67]I mean, that doesn't look like a bad guy.
[65:24.17]Iron Armband.
[65:29.29]Is this for the PlayStation 1?
[65:32.07]But it's a cute game.
[65:34.17]We're not done yet.
[65:34.85]Look.
[65:37.81]This looks like it could be interesting.
[65:42.07]I promise to skip 60% of all dialog from here on out.
[65:56.45]In the sea of no's, I see.
[65:59.31]In all capitals, THANK GOD.
[66:03.00]Alright, I'm gonna be careful.
[66:05.36]What's going on with my computer?
[66:19.39]How many floors are there?
[66:25.72]I can't wait to, like, sell all this guy's stuff.
[66:29.40]Give it to us!
[66:29.86]We'll hold it for safekeeping!
[66:31.26]Oh, thanks, guys!
[66:33.48]What an idiot.
[66:40.13]Ooh, that felt kinda good.
[66:41.27]That felt good.
[66:44.47]That was fun.
[66:53.84]He doesn't get anything.
[66:54.52]You commissioned him to go down.
[66:55.68]I'm going to translate.
[67:01.86]I think this is the last floor.
[67:03.62]Is it?
[67:04.15]Well, be careful.
[67:05.63]Was I right?
[67:09.89]I think I'm right.
[67:12.37]That's pretty close, I think.
[67:17.64]This is not what happened?
[67:21.77]Anybody here speak Japanese?
[67:23.55]Two candies.
[67:32.45]Combat's kind of fun.
[67:33.62]I can see, okay, this game is going to be fun.
[67:40.48]If this gets really hard.
[67:49.12]It's a PlayStation 1 enemy.
[67:50.82]It's alright.
[67:54.54]I might have to make the game full screen, though, because it's really kind of chugged down here for some reason.
[67:59.14]Ooh, is it a pendant?
[68:02.00]Souvenir charm.
[68:03.28]I'm gonna make, like, five grand.
[68:04.32]Ten grand.
[68:05.22]Alright, I gotta be careful.
[68:09.10]Apple?
[68:12.79]Thank you for being the canary.
[68:15.75]To tell me when to leave.
[68:17.53]No, no, no, not yet, not yet, not yet.
[68:24.28]Ooh, you gotta... Watch that side.
[68:32.79]Overestimating value, this game's downfall.
[68:42.25]I do like the weird 2D, 3D isometric.
[68:44.79]It looks weird, but it works somehow.
[68:54.55]Get the item.
[68:55.29]Hold on.
[68:55.61]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[68:56.19]What do you mean, get item?
[68:57.67]Where?
[68:59.59]Get item.
[69:01.63]Where is it?
[69:01.97]I don't see anything.
[69:07.30]No, I want to get, like, the Sonic the Hedgehog shoe.
[69:09.42]Sure.
[69:09.64]I already have a ton of those already.
[69:14.46]Alright, not a trap.
[69:21.34]I knew it was going to be a trap.
[69:25.09]Oh shit, I don't have any... I don't have enough SP to do that move, and I was timing it.
[69:32.97]Uh-oh.
[69:37.53]Is he gonna die in the tutorial?
[69:39.32]Unidentified item.
[69:41.60]Goldfish.
[69:46.00]Yeah, I'm gonna have to make this fullscreen.
[69:49.90]Unfortunately.
[69:50.58]Ooh.
[69:52.66]Longbow?
[70:00.93]I'm good.
[70:01.51]I got full health again.
[70:05.45]So what's max level that a dungeon adventurer can be?
[70:07.93]Ooh, can't carry anymore.
[70:20.28]I want that.
[70:31.74]How do I... Can I like... What the hell is going on?
[70:36.20]Items.
[70:38.22]Walnut bread.
[70:39.70]Slime fluid.
[70:42.48]Why can't I... They can only be in stacks of three?
[70:45.39]No, what?
[70:51.33]Why are these stacked?
[70:56.31]Oh, it's plus three.
[70:57.63]It's plus four.
[70:59.13]So get rid of the shitty one.
[71:00.96]I'm getting rid of this one.
[71:06.54]Alright, I gotta leave the dungeon.
[71:16.34]I'm out of space.
[71:19.10]Come on, group up, group up, group up, group up!
[71:30.95]Please be nice, his eyes are worn from six DECADES of games.
[71:48.77]Stun locked both of them, that was pretty good.
[71:52.05]Alright, so!
[71:54.25]Group up, group up.
[72:01.58]Can I get them all in a circle here, around me?
[72:03.16]Nope.
[72:06.12]Nah.
[72:06.84]Nope.
[72:08.83]Nope.
[72:10.87]Nah.
[72:11.75]Eat bread.
[72:14.15]I'll eat bread if I need it.
[72:15.59]That's probably health.
[72:17.87]Alright, let's get out of here.
[72:26.99]You found a game that I'm good at?
[72:30.19]What do you mean I finally get what I'm good at?
[72:33.23]This is just, like, the beginning.
[72:37.12]He thinks it's health.
[72:39.56]Well, why would... It's food.
[72:40.88]Ooh.
[72:48.13]Is this it?
[72:49.87]This is... Did I... Did I do it?
[72:52.01]I didn't.
[72:52.47]I did.
[72:52.75]Did I?
[72:52.89]Did I?
[72:55.23]I did it.
[72:55.73]I've cleared the Hall of Trials.
[72:57.69]Oh, sweet mystery of life.
[72:59.55]Now you'll give me money.
[73:02.53]Way to go, Louie.
[73:04.83]Reset.
[73:05.69]Tear.
[73:06.41]This is all thanks to you guys.
[73:09.33]This is all well and good, but there's a treasure chest just beyond.
[73:12.35]It behooves us to investigate thoroughly.
[73:16.27]Tear, you really do like going for the money, don't you?
[73:20.55]What?
[73:21.08]I do not spell such foolishness.
[73:23.02]There's no need to treat me like a flying ball of greed.
[73:26.66]Hey, hey, hey now!
[73:28.82]I love me some treasure too.
[73:30.68]Don't worry, Tear.
[73:31.32]I'll feel you on this.
[73:33.86]Really?
[73:34.30]You completely misunderstand me.
[73:35.84]It's gonna be trapped.
[73:42.64]So the contents of the chest... Give me just a second here.
[73:49.44]Hey, it's classified redacted documents.
[73:54.73]Wow.
[73:56.51]So this is an Adventurer's Guild card.
[74:01.05]Here, take one, like we promised.
[74:04.60]Oh, yeah, thanks.
[74:06.11]While you did promise to give us your card eventually, we're not so crass as to demand your very first card.
[74:12.49]You really should think about who you want to give your first.
[74:15.59]No, here.
[74:16.63]Take it.
[74:17.17]Please.
[74:19.38]I'd love to.
[74:19.96]Thanks, Louie.
[74:20.66]Awesome.
[74:22.38]I can't wait to adventure with you two some more.
[74:25.66]Really now, young people are so annoying with their social engagements.
[74:33.98]Hey, Tira, what's this thing that just showed up?
[74:37.49]Ah yes, that.
[74:38.07]That's a refrigerator.
[74:39.01]It's a door.
[74:42.63]You go through it, and it'll take you back to town.
[74:47.69]You clear the dungeon, and they show up when you clear a dungeon.
[74:54.16]They appear every five levels, so you can leave.
[74:56.92]Got it.
[74:59.12]Don't we have to start all the way at the beginning again?
[75:01.75]not at all you can always head back to the floor that had a door on it in fact if you do not use a door you do have to restart okay that's good to know so if you find a door always use it returning home takes time furthermore leaving ends the current contract with our companion and we would have to rehire him or choose a new one
[75:25.70]If there is something specific in a dungeon that you desire, you can simply ignore the doors and press onward.
[75:31.26]So it is Stardew Valley.
[75:34.72]This game came out in like 2006.
[75:38.48]Alrighty then, I think we have to go home now.
[75:41.11]Quite so.
[75:41.93]Just to be sure, in the future, please try to avoid referring to this as going home.
[75:47.07]Because it's not your house.
[75:49.25]You're really going to pull that on me right now?
[75:51.85]You're going to like passive-aggressively tell me that it's not my house?
[75:57.65]Now, you're gonna do that.
[76:01.56]That's unbelievable.
[76:05.24]I mean, that's actually unbelievable.
[76:10.84]Turns out it was just a movie prop.
[76:17.12]Yatta, means clear.
[76:19.34]Alright, cool.
[76:19.84]20 out of 20.
[76:20.74]What does rearrange mean?
[76:23.58]Oh, show the cool stuff first.
[76:27.05]1400 base!
[76:28.45]1400 base!
[76:29.45]650!
[76:29.53]This is gonna be sick.
[76:35.13]Couple of bird's nests.
[76:37.87]Alright.
[76:38.87]Now.
[76:40.71]Let's get this shit loaded up.
[76:47.23]Here we go.
[76:47.63]Let's get some cool stuff in the window.
[76:49.65]Get the crafter's knife in there.
[76:50.95]Get the longbow in there.
[76:55.36]Iron armband in the window.
[76:56.42]Let's put, let's get it, let's get the charms, and um... Hmm.
[77:04.40]Chocolate?
[77:06.96]A simple chocolate bar made with a cocoa base.
[77:10.88]500 bucks!
[77:16.33]1100!
[77:16.35]That's like the finest chocolate in the fucking world.
[77:27.91]Alright, clothes.
[77:28.91]Get these off.
[77:29.45]Replace these with the sandals.
[77:33.83]I guess you can just keep them up there.
[77:35.01]This is the clothes shop store over here.
[77:38.76]Alright, uh, what does it take?
[77:43.46]Atmosphere?
[77:45.58]What was that?
[77:47.02]It just said store atmosphere.
[77:48.26]Okay.
[77:55.46]I'm ready to make some money.
[78:00.21]Store atmosphere.
[78:01.07]Oh, here we go.
[78:01.71]It's her.
[78:03.91]Store atmosphere.
[78:04.91]Wait, why is this like a political spectrum?
[78:08.40]Store atmosphere according to tier.
[78:10.18]Light, dark, gaudy, plain.
[78:23.25]Well, we're very much on the right side here.
[78:29.57]Do we want to be light and gaudy, or do we want to be dark and plain?
[78:35.67]Or do we want to be plain and light?
[78:45.74]So, we're very plain.
[78:49.50]Merchant level, I can see.
[78:50.46]Level 1, starting level.
[78:51.72]Customers, yeah.
[78:53.28]Can take orders, more items.
[78:54.88]Alright, we're just starting.
[78:58.29]I'm ready to open the store.
[79:02.50]Wait, isn't it, like, night time?
[79:06.88]What time is it?
[79:09.66]Oh, we got a lot of customers!
[79:13.65]Ooh!
[79:15.53]Hold on, wait.
[79:16.19]Yeah, you're over set.
[79:16.95]Bring this up, please.
[79:19.17]Wooden shield.
[79:20.47]So you- $6.50.
[79:21.39]Alright, hold on.
[79:22.17]Everybody slow down here!
[79:24.07]Hey, get away from there!
[79:25.26]Don't touch that!
[79:26.08]I need to get some security cameras.
[79:30.34]I'm sticking to my guns on this, no way.
[79:33.32]Alright, look, pick it up again and I like ya.
[79:38.73]Hey, there's no beating you, you said.
[79:40.65]Yeah, I'll take that price.
[79:42.83]Got it.
[79:45.81]Gee, I sold my armband for 700 bucks.
[79:49.33]Anybody else?
[79:51.07]Welcome!
[79:52.56]Ooh, can I purchase this from you?
[79:54.12]1400.
[79:54.14]Should we just fuck this guy?
[79:58.84]Uh...
[80:02.22]1800.
[80:04.30]Right then, I'd call that a fair deal.
[80:07.01]Thanks.
[80:08.45]That's a lot.
[80:12.51]Anybody?
[80:13.79]What can I get you?
[80:15.95]You have one of these?
[80:16.75]That's a lucky day for both of us then.
[80:18.55]Yeah, it sure is.
[80:20.37]2000.
[80:22.67]That's a long bow.
[80:27.01]That's rare.
[80:35.28]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[80:38.24]1,900.
[80:38.26]1,850.
[80:38.90]I feel like I'm playing the prices.
[80:41.86]1,800.
[80:41.88]Got it.
[80:42.44]The money just flows.
[80:51.70]Oh, it's me again.
[80:53.24]Could I also have this?
[80:56.42]Longsword. 1,700.
[81:05.30]1650.
[81:05.42]Take it or leave it.
[81:12.18]I just made a lot of money.
[81:17.77]You did well!
[81:18.35]You look tired!
[81:19.01]Ooh!
[81:21.37]Profits!
[81:23.80]Imagine selling shit in real life if it was this easy.
[81:30.48]Alright, so I sold... Oh yeah, I sold that bread earlier too.
[81:33.13]Profits plus 5,000.
[81:34.27]Score difference.
[81:38.73]I didn't buy anything today.
[81:41.15]Look, fuck it.
[81:41.61]We're just gonna buy more.
[81:42.89]We're just gonna open the shop again.
[81:44.39]Now I'm no longer an adventurer store.
[81:46.41]I'm like an ice cream and candy store.
[81:49.73]What's wrong?
[81:53.05]Concerning the debt.
[81:54.71]I have a suggestion concerning its... How much do I owe you?
[82:00.17]Paying it all back at once is wholly beyond your means.
[82:02.15]How do you know that?
[82:04.29]Small weekly payments.
[82:09.59]Wholly beyond.
[82:10.35]This is where we have to see all this bullshit.
[82:13.51]Oh, you made $6,000.
[82:13.91]Well, hold on.
[82:14.77]Here's the $2,000 for the taxes, of course.
[82:16.91]Take taxes out first.
[82:18.01]Now you're at $4,000.
[82:19.18]Oh, you have a couple of credit cards.
[82:20.70]You have a couple of small loans.
[82:22.06]That's another $1,500, $2,000.
[82:22.50]Let's take that away from you, too.
[82:23.40]That's your money, but it's not anymore.
[82:29.32]If it leaves you with like a $1,200, you get a car payment, too.
[82:31.82]Makes you pay that car down to your $1,000.
[82:33.78]How much is it to eat food?
[82:34.90]Oh, to pay for groceries, you're talking about like $400, $500, $600 a month.
[82:38.30]Alright, now you're down to like $300.
[82:39.16]What, you want to buy anything else for you?
[82:41.99]Sorry.
[82:43.55]Get lost.
[82:52.11]I just want to go to Disney.
[82:53.99]Okay?
[82:55.77]I want to go to Disney with my family.
[82:59.17]And it's like four grand!
[83:01.27]Stop taxing me!
[83:02.67]Stop putting me in debt!
[83:04.70]Stop overpricing your shit!
[83:06.00]I just wanna go to Disney!
[83:07.56]That's all I care about!
[83:08.48]All I wanted was a Pepsi?
[83:29.51]Libertarian.
[83:35.67]You never told me how big Papa's debt is, exactly.
[83:40.11]That's because you would faint if you found out.
[83:41.81]For now, it's a secret.
[83:44.12]So you, like, predatory lended my father.
[83:48.14]Stop taxing me!
[83:49.58]Stop putting my family in debt!
[83:52.82]Let me prosper, for God's sakes!
[84:05.85]Hire a good lawyer?
[84:07.21]Oh, I can't wait to hire a good lawyer.
[84:09.45]What's that, like seven grand?
[84:11.79]Stop taxing me.
[84:12.83]Stop putting me in debt.
[84:13.89]Stop making me get a lawyer every three months.
[84:28.00]Actual anger.
[84:32.66]As the store begins to build up steam, we will increase payment size.
[84:37.41]Ten thousand dollars.
[84:39.51]The repayment date nearest to the current date.
[84:41.55]How much of that is interest?
[84:43.21]How much of that am I paying down to principal?
[84:45.65]You fucking floating motherfucker.
[84:47.51]How much of that is interest?
[84:55.04]The amount due will be displayed on the calendar in the main menu.
[84:57.54]Please be sure to check it regularly.
[84:58.86]What if I don't?
[85:03.38]Can I just not pay?
[85:07.38]Karate.
[85:08.34]I'll keep an eye on it.
[85:11.92]I can't wait to get bills in the mail.
[85:24.74]Wait, do I have anything else to put up here?
[85:27.96]Oh, slimes.
[85:31.42]Slime plus three.
[85:34.28]Let's do...
[85:36.89]Let's get some... Look, we got slime.
[85:39.52]Slime next to the bread, probably not a good idea, but we got slime, we got bread.
[85:46.20]Here we go.
[85:47.48]Open it up.
[85:50.83]I am now a candy store.
[85:53.55]Ooh, slime fluid, plus three.
[85:57.39]Ooh, I'll take this.
[86:01.72]Right then, I called it a fair deal.
[86:04.28]Thank you.
[86:07.29]Somebody buy the chocolate.
[86:08.15]It's expensive.
[86:11.01]This he'll do.
[86:12.27]Souvenir charm.
[86:15.57]Can't you sell it for just a little less?
[86:20.38]Alright.
[86:21.50]I'm old.
[86:22.72]And I think that $3.99 is the same thing as $400.
[86:27.16]Because I've been conditioned to think that for some reason, $0.99 of some sense means it's way less.
[86:34.01]Thank you.
[86:34.55]Have a good day.
[86:35.41]Thank you very much.
[86:44.47]Oh, it's me again.
[86:46.65]How much for this cloning?
[86:48.65]It's a little too expensive for me.
[86:50.45]99 cents, that's a fair deal for me.
[86:54.78]Thank you.
[87:01.86]Oh, it's me again.
[87:03.38]You have such good prices at your store.
[87:05.78]How much is this bread?
[87:09.64]Oh, it's 99 cents.
[87:13.56]I'll take it.
[87:21.05]Looking for something?
[87:22.99]I want this.
[87:26.99]Oh, right.
[87:27.41]I should have done 199.
[87:29.55]I was scamming myself.
[87:31.97]Well, well, young lady.
[87:33.93]That'll be...
[87:45.43]Could you make it a little cheaper?
[87:46.65]This is getting dumb That's getting like trouble because I was like selling like something too expensive to like child I
[88:09.28]Wait, she wasn't buying like a knife, right?
[88:11.64]What was she buying?
[88:16.19]Was that a plant?
[88:18.29]Bread, bread.
[88:18.97]Okay, she wasn't buying like a sword or anything.
[88:25.55]Well, then you seem to have developed a basic understanding of how to sell things to people and not drive them to burn the shop in anger.
[88:32.00]Yep-a-roni.
[88:33.80]Yep-a-roni.
[88:35.96]Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[88:40.67]Why do I feel like my mother just texted me back?
[88:43.09]Yes.
[88:45.81]Being a truly great store owner involves more than selling things, however.
[88:48.71]There are times when people will want to sell items to you.
[88:53.78]Really?
[88:54.04]I suspect we'll begin to get such offers very soon.
[88:58.70]But I already buy stuff from the guild and the market, so why should I worry about buying stuff from the customers?
[89:04.65]There's one major difference between a guild or a market purchase, and a purchase from an individual.
[89:09.44]Individuals do not have set prices.
[89:12.20]In other words, you can scam them as you do while you're selling.
[89:17.28]Haggle down.
[89:19.82]Oh, so I can get stuff really cheap.
[89:21.71]But that seems like it'd be pretty hard.
[89:24.05]Fundamentally, buying and selling are not that different.
[89:26.79]The customer shows you an item they wish to sell, and then you set a price and perhaps negotiate.
[89:33.14]Obviously, you wish to pay less than the base price of the item.
[89:37.08]Okay, so buy high and sell low.
[89:40.52]That sounds like what I do on markets all the time.
[89:43.90]Just so.
[89:44.38]That is the very core of a successful business.
[89:46.78]Now then, shall we practice?
[89:48.86]The fundamental procedure is the same as when selling.
[89:52.20]Okay.
[89:55.06]Welcome to Recettear.
[89:57.56]Would you buy this from me?
[90:00.06]Hmm.
[90:01.00]I'm going to need to name a price.
[90:09.97]1096.
[90:12.99]At this level, there will not be much profit when we resell.
[90:16.09]Go somewhat lower.
[90:17.21]Really?
[90:17.51]Alright, this is like a knockoff at this point.
[90:24.02]8% of base price.
[90:25.42]826.
[90:30.19]Excellent.
[90:30.47]This is a good price level.
[90:31.55]Now then, let us practice haggling over the price.
[90:33.47]It's the same.
[90:35.19]Now that you have offered a price you believe to be fair, adjust your offer until they agree to sell to you.
[90:41.07]Could you offer me a little more?
[90:42.01]I think it's worth a lot.
[90:49.11]50% and 70% of the base is a good target.
[90:50.76]You will gain an item to sell without giving up too much money.
[90:52.90]Let's go.
[91:03.87]Welcome.
[91:05.55]Uh, what would you be willing to pay for this?
[91:08.19]I forgot everything you told me.
[91:09.45]Pay twice?
[91:15.52]150.
[91:15.54]Thank you.
[91:15.86]Welcome.
[91:16.16]$2,000 for a baked yam.
[91:17.20]Bring that down.
[91:17.66]$900.
[91:17.68]You're really easy to buy from.
[91:18.44]I can say whatever I want.
[91:23.41]You just removed 65% of all value.
[91:44.25]Alright, what items do I have?
[91:46.31]Put the apple on there.
[91:47.73]I want this to be a food-based restaurant.
[91:49.43]Alright, and then back scratcher's gonna go up here.
[91:51.43]Uh, right here.
[91:53.47]Get rid of that.
[91:54.99]Get this other bullshit over here.
[92:16.17]Alright, let's do it again.
[92:21.52]One, two, three.
[92:23.16]Open the store.
[92:26.90]Welcome.
[92:27.20]Can I help you with anything?
[92:28.16]I remember you.
[92:29.90]This is a present from Mommy.
[92:37.43]It's a present.
[92:39.57]You know, it's a present from Mom.
[92:46.32]This is getting dumb.
[92:57.90]She's smart though.
[92:59.49]Oh, it's me again.
[93:00.39]I'm really easy to sell to.
[93:02.87]Need to help the old pension, you see.
[93:04.99]What can I get for this?
[93:06.83]I mean, bread sucks.
[93:11.97]I mean, you won't... I got plenty of bread.
[93:14.69]40.
[93:14.71]She's about right, yeah.
[93:19.72]Yeah, that seems perfectly normal.
[93:21.80]I've read that online, therefore it's real.
[93:24.04]Bye!
[93:26.18]Oh, I got walnut bread!
[93:32.13]Welcome.
[93:35.25]I sold it to him.
[93:36.03]I thought he was selling it to me.
[93:40.55]No, he was buying.
[93:43.73]He was selling that to me.
[93:45.69]He was selling that to me.
[93:47.99]So I bought it for 40.
[93:50.26]Right?
[93:55.94]Wait, wait, wait.
[93:56.40]What are you guys talking about?
[93:59.52]I bought that from him for 40.
[94:00.82]I had that right.
[94:03.33]What are you talking about?
[94:06.07]Why is everybody attacking me right now?
[94:11.66]I picked this up while nosing around a cave.
[94:13.76]Can I sell it?
[94:14.56]See, he wants to sell it to me for 2300.
[94:15.72]Get out of here, man.
[94:16.64]I want to pay 1300 for this.
[94:18.14]Less than that.
[94:19.60]I want to lie to his face.
[94:20.88]43% of face price.
[94:22.30]See?
[94:22.54]Didn't think I'd get that good a price.
[94:24.57]He's dumb.
[94:38.84]I can sell that for like 3,000.
[94:39.70]I was looking for this.
[94:44.20]Okay.
[94:47.28]I was looking for this, so let's go... 170.
[94:54.37]This guy's really, really, really gullible.
[94:57.49]Could you take it down just a little bit?
[94:59.15]Sure.
[95:01.59]That's unreasonable.
[95:06.68]Hi, what can I get for you?
[95:08.82]You have it!
[95:09.36]Yay!
[95:10.44]Please, I just want to buy my mother a present.
[95:13.64]Okay, now you know I'm full of shit, so... I can't... I can't... You know I'm full of shit, so let's go 105.
[95:22.77]I'm a good shopper, right?
[95:25.11]Oh, you little shit.
[95:26.31]I knew what you were doing, and you know that I respect you for that.
[95:30.27]I respect you for doing that to me.
[95:37.42]Can I help you?
[95:38.66]Any chance I could get you to buy this, little lady?
[95:40.92]Thank you very much.
[95:49.11]I bought it.
[95:53.46]It's a yam.
[95:55.08]It's a really expensive yam.
[95:57.44]Oh, you're old.
[95:57.98]Hold on, give me one second.
[95:58.86]Let me pick this up.
[96:00.08]Uh, this is a rock.
[96:01.54]It's a rock?
[96:02.38]Yes, it's a rock.
[96:03.52]This is only, this is worth nothing.
[96:04.98]Oh, sorry.
[96:06.70]Thank you.
[96:07.28]Bye.
[96:07.74]You can have it.
[96:11.16]I'd like this, 100.
[96:11.94]120.
[96:11.96]That seems fair.
[96:27.86]Holy cow, it's late.
[96:28.82]Time seemed to fly by today.
[96:30.72]Speaking of time, I plan on doing some mild schedule management for you from now on to ensure you're working in an effective manner to pay back the debt.
[96:39.63]What are you talking about?
[96:42.69]I've broken up the day into four time periods.
[96:46.59]Morning, afternoon, evening, and night.
[96:48.21]Mm-hmm.
[96:51.40]What you can do and how much you can do depends on the time of day.
[96:56.26]Hey, yeah, the clock's been broken up into four areas.
[96:59.76]Think of each part as a slice of time.
[97:01.78]A slice, mmm, like pie.
[97:05.05]Yeah, okay.
[97:07.55]I thought I would be able to keep your attention if I made it rather similar to some sort of sweet food.
[97:12.73]So there's the morning slice, the afternoon, I'm getting hungry.
[97:20.21]So there's four sections of the day.
[97:25.05]You can only act between morning and night.
[97:27.67]Yes, when night ends, you need to go to bed.
[97:30.17]Trying to run a shop while sleep deprived is unpleasant, so... I'll close it when it gets late.
[97:36.11]So you essentially have two options for each slice.
[97:38.49]You can open the store for a time, or go about town on business.
[97:43.00]You can't do both at once, so decide in advance what you need to do.
[97:46.78]To be clear, opening the shop will consume a slice and returning to the store after going out, regardless of what you actually did, will also consume a slice.
[97:58.15]But what if I go to, like, the plaza and then the chapel?
[98:01.94]Slice.
[98:02.84]Slice.
[98:04.12]You can get around town easily enough to avoid consuming a slice with each move.
[98:08.54]Only when you return to the store will the clock advance a slice.
[98:12.02]So in that case, I should do a lot when I leave the shop.
[98:14.72]Yes.
[98:15.79]That's a good attitude to take.
[98:16.99]Now.
[98:17.21]There's another vital element leaving town altogether.
[98:22.85]Visiting a dungeon will consume two slices.
[98:26.09]No matter what.
[98:28.19]That takes that long?
[98:29.73]So if I go in the morning, I'll get back in the evening?
[98:32.53]That is precisely how it works.
[98:35.75]Thus, you can only leave for a dungeon at an early point in the day.
[98:39.79]If it is night or you have done something else that evening, you cannot go.
[98:43.49]Because if I did go, I'd get back real late, right?
[98:47.89]Exactly.
[98:49.03]Not only would you annoy your adventurer companions with staying out so late, you would also be dead on your feet the next day after returning.
[98:57.13]Man, this is a lot to wrap my head around.
[98:59.45]You guys ever watch training videos?
[99:04.04]Company training videos?
[99:06.50]I'm getting that vibe right now.
[99:10.62]Go watch the Pizza Hut training video.
[99:13.04]I watch it all the time.
[99:14.88]We're making it great.
[99:16.44]I'm not kidding.
[99:17.00]I like lie in bed and watch training videos.
[99:23.61]They're like soothing to me.
[99:25.15]I don't know why.
[99:32.36]That's sad.
[99:33.00]What do you mean that's sad?
[99:35.54]I'll have my iPad and like, Kim will be next to me and we'll be like, okay, good night, I'm going to bed.
[99:41.38]We'll be like on our devices.
[99:43.96]And I'll load up the Wendy's training video.
[99:48.58]It's like 45 minutes long.
[99:50.48]And I just watch it.
[99:58.34]It's like an infomercial.
[100:01.86]Before you know it, you will be thinking about it naturally.
[100:07.80]You guys, yeah, don't, you don't, you put the sauce in the middle and you go out, you leave about a half an inch on the edge.
[100:12.64]You don't put the sauce all the way to the edge of the pizza.
[100:15.38]And you want to line the toppings up with the sauce never to go over that edge of the pizza, especially when making a pan pizza.
[100:28.53]Well, it helps that you will always be able to see how much time a particular action will consume.
[100:32.69]Simply pay attention to the clock.
[100:33.75]I want to make sure you weigh out all your cheese and stuff.
[100:36.34]And you do a top cheese as well.
[100:39.94]The Doughmaster in the morning will give you... And if there's any bubbles or it doesn't look very good, report it to the Doughmaster and use another one.
[100:53.43]I will be glad to go over it as often as you need.
[100:55.03]I don't think I need to go over it anymore.
[101:02.00]I'm actually a dough master.
[101:06.22]So you know what I'm talking about.
[101:07.31]Alright, so I can open this door one more time.
[101:13.73]Look at this shit.
[101:15.25]Baked yam.
[101:16.53]Let's get our food here.
[101:17.81]Beef bowl.
[101:20.05]Let's put nothing here.
[101:21.99]Back scratcher should go over this way.
[101:24.55]Sandals.
[101:28.06]Put the bread up here.
[101:32.68]And I want the fish up there too.
[101:39.12]Back scratcher goes down here.
[101:41.75]These are going to sell for thousands of dollars.
[101:46.77]The old guy's going to come in the store and buy the yam for three times as much as he sold it to you for.
[101:53.96]Hey there.
[101:56.01]Mommy asked me to sell this unthankful statue.
[101:59.51]I can't, I can't, uh... I gotta, I gotta do decent prices with her.
[102:19.57]Excuse me, how about you just yam?
[102:23.31]A tight balance sheet this month?
[102:24.63]This is precious, but I think I can sell it.
[102:27.70]It's bread.
[102:30.48]Don't kid yourself, it ain't worth that much.
[102:35.10]Is it really worth so little?
[102:36.82]Hmm.
[102:40.90]Oh, really?
[102:41.80]Thanks!
[102:55.69]It's you again.
[102:57.75]This is a present for daddy.
[103:07.18]As long as I make a little bit of money.
[103:09.84]Come up with the yam, old man.
[103:12.05]Looking for something special.
[103:14.01]Ooh, I've been thinking about getting one of these for a while now.
[103:17.57]One goldfish graham cracker.
[103:21.35]Now these are expensive. $1,500.
[103:27.13]Customer service seems to be a lost art these days.
[103:35.23]That's fine, thank you.
[103:37.31]No, thank you.
[103:41.22]Anybody else?
[103:44.12]You have one of these?
[103:44.90]It's a lucky day for both of us.
[103:46.00]Didn't you just sell this to me?
[103:58.10]alright so you lost a hundred bucks you lost it well you lost a full dollar excuse me miss I would like to ask you if I could buy this please sir weren't you in here yesterday yesterday
[104:26.41]I don't know what you're talking about.
[104:27.67]I haven't been here.
[104:28.77]Oh, that'll do.
[104:38.19]Thank you.
[104:42.24]What a scam.
[104:45.38]I can't help but notice what you just did to that old man.
[104:48.12]I'm reporting you.
[104:49.86]I'm reporting you to OSHA.
[104:51.08]Hey, could I purchase this?
[104:57.32]Yeah, you sure can.
[104:58.86]Three pieces.
[105:04.34]Gee, I sold an apple.
[105:10.60]So this, do you think I could turn it into a bit of coin?
[105:14.02]So you're selling me this candy, okay.
[105:15.44]Yeah, I mean, like, maybe.
[105:17.68]Got it.
[105:29.86]I almost have $10,000.
[105:34.17]You seem more or less used to the basics of running a shop.
[105:38.31]As one of the matter, however, you cannot always be certain that a customer will know what they want when they come in.
[105:42.91]What are you talking about?
[105:46.01]They may come in thinking, oh, what should I make for dinner?
[105:48.65]What would be a good weapon and so forth?
[105:50.17]They will not be quite sure exactly what they wish to purchase when they come through our door.
[105:54.05]In such a case, we must provide them with advice to help them decide.
[105:59.08]Wait, wait.
[105:59.98]How could I do that?
[106:01.76]Many customers will simply give up if they do not find something suitable for their needs on our counters.
[106:07.47]Others, however, will realize that we may have reserved stock and will inquire as to whether or not we have something they seek.
[106:14.57]That's when you may suggest an item you think they would like.
[106:17.06]Okay.
[106:23.38]Okay.
[106:25.31]You'll impress them if you know what they want, and you'll cause them to return.
[106:29.31]No pressure then, okay.
[106:31.65]Let's practice.
[106:36.76]KK.
[106:37.98]Welcome!
[106:39.22]I would like a sword, please.
[106:41.36]So, anything is okay as long as it's a sword?
[106:45.14]Ultimately, you must pick something the person would like.
[106:47.49]By the way, if I may give you a little advice.
[106:50.13]If you sell weapons and armor to your adventurer friends, they will equip the items you sell them.
[106:55.68]Meaning, of course, that if you sell items to them, then we do not need to lend them any items at the start of a dungeon.
[107:03.03]And we'll be able to bring back more items for our own use.
[107:08.39]Even if an adventurer must retreat while in a dungeon, the equipment is not lost, since it's in their possession.
[107:15.69]So we're just going to scam the whole way.
[107:18.03]We're doing meta-scamming.
[107:21.89]So we want to sell to our adventurer friends, even if you must undersell it to them.
[107:27.42]Well, we don't have to do that, don't worry.
[107:29.70]Accessories work the same way, so think carefully about who you sell what to and what effect it may have on their performance.
[107:38.33]So that guy came in and he bought the armband.
[107:41.05]So if I get any cool armor or weapons, only sell it to the adventurers.
[107:49.73]You can see what that person currently has and see if it's better than.
[107:52.77]That's cool.
[107:54.87]Alright, let's go.
[107:57.07]I'd like a sword, please.
[107:59.16]I got one for you here.
[107:59.90]It's a steel sword.
[108:00.84]Yes, excellent.
[108:01.50]The rest is like a normal sale.
[108:10.15]Hello.
[108:11.17]I'd like a weapon, however.
[108:15.01]However what?
[108:18.06]Some windbreaker.
[108:19.42]How about something like this?
[108:22.12]Oh, this is lovely.
[108:22.94]How much is it?
[108:25.68]Hmm, could you go a little lower?
[108:29.24]Excellent price.
[108:30.20]Thank you.
[108:32.98]This is a Ponzi scheme.
[108:40.43]I'd like a weapon.
[108:41.31]However... Here, how about this long sword?
[108:45.01]Oh, that's lovely.
[108:45.63]How much is it?
[108:48.47]1,400.
[108:48.53]Thank you!
[108:59.80]Yeah, speaking of debt... So... Today's the 3rd.
[109:05.16]I have... 1, 2, 3, 4, 5... I have to pay $10,000 on the 8th.
[109:08.63]That's all my money!
[109:16.04]I mean, can I start burying cash in the backyard?
[109:32.03]Good thing I fucking did that.
[109:33.81]Holy shit, that would have been horrible if I got crashed.
[109:42.69]Alright, so it's night time, can't open the store.
[109:44.81]Oh yeah, actually, I kinda could.
[109:45.95]Let's put, like, candy up here.
[109:48.41]No, I wanna sell, I wanna sell this.
[109:51.03]Oh, here we go.
[109:52.18]I don't suppose you have a scarf?
[110:13.53]Shit.
[110:18.43]Uh... Do you wanna backscratcher?
[110:22.00]How much for this candy?
[110:22.80]380.
[110:22.82]I can't ask you to go any lower, right?
[110:25.68]No, you can't.
[110:28.96]Except you can.
[110:46.24]This is for sale, right?
[110:47.46]Eight?
[110:47.88]Ooh.
[110:50.40]Thousand bucks.
[110:55.28]I knew I was going to sell those.
[110:56.48]I want to sell the beef bowl.
[110:58.04]Damn it.
[110:59.70]Good night.
[111:00.72]Good night.
[111:01.04]4,600 bucks in profit.
[111:07.11]Yeah, that guy doesn't know how to negotiate.
[111:13.45]Some people don't like negotiating.
[111:15.09]I don't really like it.
[111:18.65]Some people, you know, if somebody says, oh, that's, uh... But here's the problem with negotiating.
[111:24.01]You... This is why, like, this world is so fucking dumb, okay?
[111:28.81]You can't, like, go into a Macy's and negotiate the price of a pair of pants.
[111:35.01]You can't walk up to the fucking counter at Macy's with, like, a pair of fucking jeans.
[111:40.79]Uh, this says 80.
[111:41.84]I want to pay 60.
[111:44.05]Sir, what the fuck are you talking about?
[111:46.91]Security?
[111:47.47]We have like a fucking weirdo at the front desk.
[111:50.63]But you can do that with other forms of property.
[111:57.06]Why?
[111:57.30]You can negotiate some places, but other places you'll get like arrested if you try to tell them you're going to pay $50 for the $80 jeans.
[112:18.31]You can do that with a house, but not a pair of sandals.
[112:20.55]That's what I'm saying.
[112:24.67]Negotiation is such a strange thing.
[112:27.47]I can't, like, negotiate with the guy at the bar how much the drink is.
[112:30.81]Alright, I wanna go buy some stuff.
[112:35.50]I have a lot of money.
[112:38.68]Yeah, that's $7.50 for the Bud Light.
[112:40.72]Uh, I mean, what you meant to say was $5.00.
[112:45.03]Uh, can we get this fucking guy out of here?
[112:47.89]And then he, like, cut to you getting, like, thrown out onto the street.
[112:53.87]Alright, let's go to the market.
[113:02.00]Hmm.
[113:03.36]Tree seed necklace.
[113:06.50]Cloth cape.
[113:07.42]Wait, hold on.
[113:09.54]This is a lot of money, but I could just sell a bunch of cloth.
[113:17.92]Old muffler.
[113:20.37]He already has this one.
[113:21.63]I don't even want that on the store.
[113:25.65]Powerful ring.
[113:27.13]Unthankful statue.
[113:36.77]Medicine?
[113:38.41]I'm gonna get a bunch of capes.
[113:40.07]Yeah.
[113:41.29]Alright guys, I'm going all in on capes.
[113:49.37]It's gonna be the cape store.
[113:50.69]What do you mean rip?
[113:54.75]What?
[113:57.43]I can't negotiate with this person.
[114:00.08]You understand?
[114:01.06]Even in the same town.
[114:02.92]It's not consistent.
[114:09.66]Okay.
[114:09.92]Alright, let's go.
[114:16.42]Let me look.
[114:16.81]What's in the chapel?
[114:19.01]Say, Terry, you came from a finance company, right?
[114:23.13]What on Earth?
[114:24.60]Yes, that's right.
[114:25.36]I work for Termi Finance.
[114:27.08]I got plenty... Wait a minute.
[114:31.60]I don't have enough time to do this.
[114:34.20]You're employed by them, right?
[114:35.36]What's it like?
[114:38.02]No, that's not quite accurate.
[114:39.78]I was contracted to Termi through another organization.
[114:43.55]Thus, I'm not really an employee per se.
[114:47.49]So you just contract it.
[114:48.63]I'm surprised.
[114:49.19]You seem so... It's not that surprising.
[114:52.29]Almost all fairies in human society belong to a fairy-specific contract agency.
[114:58.21]There are, of course, a few free agent fairies out there as well.
[115:02.18]And so that's how it works.
[115:03.82]Yeah.
[115:05.16]It's like a baseball team.
[115:09.44]Yes, to tell the truth, it can be difficult for fairies to find employment in human society.
[115:13.68]So the agencies were founded...
[115:17.02]an age ago in order to help facilitate fairy livelihoods that's amazing quite we just had that conversation in the church what was the point of doing that in the church alright what about town square I love being able to relax in the plaza like this you never seem to have trouble relaxing even when we are not in the plaza
[115:46.98]I can't, I try, sometimes I can do it.
[115:48.98]That, like, drop, water droplet, like, whoop!
[115:51.72]Can you guys do that?
[115:54.32]If you, like, uh, tap the side of your cheek and go like, whoop!
[115:57.31]I used to be able to do it.
[116:02.55]I can't do it anymore.
[116:05.83]Uh, well, it's healthy, right?
[116:08.99]What a waste of time.
[116:10.59]Let's go to the pool.
[116:13.51]Uh, this is closed.
[116:16.19]Let's just, let's go.
[116:17.59]Let's go.
[116:17.91]Let's sell the cakes for fucking a ton of money.
[116:22.06]Look, we got bibs and we got beef.
[116:25.64]Beef and bibs.
[116:26.38]That's a cool restaurant name where you can just be as sloppy as you fucking want.
[116:30.88]Don't take, nobody take that.
[116:31.86]That's mine.
[116:33.38]Bibs and beef.
[116:34.96]Where the whole counter, it's all sloppy like fucking sloppy Joe sandwiches and wicked gross like pulled pork you eat with your hands.
[116:43.17]And the whole table is covered with a sheet.
[116:46.53]And you get a big bib.
[116:48.85]Nobody, that's mine.
[116:50.90]Bankrupt?
[116:55.20]What are you talking about?
[116:59.72]You know how much it costs to make a sloppy Joe?
[117:06.13]You talk about, like, capitalism.
[117:07.51]A sloppy Joe takes like 48 cents to make.
[117:10.25]You can sell it for like seven dollars.
[117:15.64]Alright, that looks good.
[117:22.70]By the way, I just want to be sure everyone is aware that I said that on stream.
[117:26.09]And it's gonna be time stamped.
[117:27.39]It is July 6th, 2019.
[117:31.89]I am doing a verbal document here.
[117:34.17]A verbal out loud document that I... I'm a verbal out loud patent of bibs and beef.
[117:41.08]A store where... A restaurant where you eat food with a bib.
[117:44.34]And you can eat like sloppy joes and shit.
[117:48.68]My grandchild's been pestering me to get a hat.
[117:52.45]I don't have hats, so... Do you want like a bird's nest hat?
[118:02.36]He's like, dunking on his head.
[118:05.64]What are you doing?
[118:06.50]Welcome to Beefs and Bib, motherfucker.
[118:11.31]I don't have, I don't have that.
[118:13.89]You don't have any?
[118:15.89]I'm terrible, how can you be terrible at not having inventory?
[118:21.37]Shit.
[118:22.83]I'm looking for some chocolate.
[118:25.17]And of course, you're selling this when I'm near broke.
[118:31.14]He is okay.
[118:31.72]Does it get like the 5% adventurer friend discount?
[118:39.47]No.
[118:41.17]I was looking to sell that.
[118:46.49]Alright, somebody buy a cloak.
[118:49.15]There it is.
[118:49.49]No.
[118:50.89]Haha, never thought I'd find one of these.
[118:52.49]How much should I buy?
[119:01.65]Dropped it by 5 cents.
[119:02.71]Get outta here.
[119:06.28]Somebody buy those cloaks!
[119:09.60]I spent a lot of money on these.
[119:19.00]Why does nobody want this?
[119:22.97]Somebody doesn't want a cape!
[119:26.97]Buy it!
[119:29.47]They're really nice.
[119:31.95]Oh, hello.
[119:32.53]I would like this cape.
[119:33.59]My daughter-in-law asked me to pick this up.
[119:38.55]That's too much!
[119:42.59]There we go.
[119:48.86]You invested in capes right before the great cape crash.
[119:52.92]Do I have a weapon?
[119:55.92]I don't.
[119:56.92]Backscratcher is not a weapon.
[120:06.09]Shit.
[120:08.68]Do I have no talent?
[120:11.12]Hey, I can use your weapon.
[120:21.33]Well, you don't have it.
[120:22.43]You don't have it.
[120:23.31]Why did he say it twice?
[120:25.81]Well, you don't have it.
[120:27.11]You don't have it.
[120:28.75]Uh-oh.
[120:35.21]Do I have to pay the debt back?
[120:39.49]I've got plenty of time.
[120:45.84]I'm looking for a treasure!
[120:48.88]That's a treasure.
[120:51.02]The ultimate in treasures.
[120:52.61]Sir, may I divert your attention over here?
[120:56.57]To the backscratcher.
[121:01.48]All those hard to reach places.
[121:03.82]I know sometimes at work, I've seen you do the bear up against your furnace and move back and forth, scratching your back on the hard iron.
[121:12.72]Not anymore, sir.
[121:18.38]It is worth a lot.
[121:23.24]Don't have enough money on hand.
[121:24.74]It's a pretty good lie.
[121:28.74]What?! !
[121:33.39]That was only 125%!
[121:33.87]Negative 2100!
[121:34.19]Negative 2100.
[121:34.43]How?
[121:34.51]I didn't...
[122:02.59]Where's the negative 20?
[122:03.59]Oh, the capes.
[122:05.65]Shit, that's right.
[122:06.33]Okay, I'm gonna go buy a sword.
[122:07.39]Wait, how much money do I have?
[122:10.75]No, you know what?
[122:11.18]Fuck it.
[122:13.08]Uh, let's go.
[122:13.74]Worn sword.
[122:14.48]Level 6.
[122:17.32]Louie, let's go.
[122:37.44]Here we go!
[122:42.82]Jade Way!
[122:44.28]Which one?
[122:44.78]Jade Way.
[122:46.22]Hall of Trials?
[122:46.84]Jade Way!
[122:47.58]Floor 1 to 5.
[122:48.56]Wait, Hall of Trials... Jade Way.
[122:58.62]Equip items in the bag, yes.
[122:59.88]Okay, here we go!
[123:06.45]I wish she would just say that.
[123:09.15]Ooh, okay, we got unidentified ingredient.
[123:14.56]Those bees, those little bugs I think are bad.
[123:41.39]Ingredient.
[123:42.59]Come on, something cool.
[123:45.72]Unthankful statue.
[123:46.60]That thing's dumb.
[123:54.26]It's a mimic.
[123:58.62]No, not yet, not yet.
[123:59.70]There's probably something down here.
[124:05.56]Lots of unidentified items.
[124:06.75]How do I identify the items again?
[124:08.01]I just have to leave with them, right?
[124:15.73]It automatically does it.
[124:21.85]Oh, okay.
[124:23.39]Sick.
[124:28.95]You do it with your butt.
[124:30.47]I mean, a laugh face.
[124:37.27]Ah, I see.
[124:43.03]Is it snow?
[124:45.48]Oh, I just made it snow.
[124:46.60]I made it slippery.
[124:53.82]Holy shit, it's snow.
[124:59.96]It's the ice level in Mario again, yeah.
[125:02.00]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[125:05.31]News!
[125:06.41]SP consumption has been halved!
[125:12.11]Is this a good thing or a bad thing?
[125:15.87]Alright, I wanna get a good sword and sell it to him.
[125:20.65]Because this guy's sword sucks.
[125:27.11]How am I ever gonna fight the dragon that's at the end if I'm gonna have a worn sword?
[125:30.65]I mean, you still gotta pay for it, but... I'm gonna give it to him.
[125:38.01]Imminent crash incoming.
[125:39.59]Imminent crash.
[125:47.00]He's gonna put more points into strength?
[125:48.44]Yeah, but I'm not in control of that.
[125:52.02]He's in control of his own build.
[125:55.98]I have nothing to do with it.
[126:00.02]Ooh.
[126:01.58]Common shield.
[126:03.77]Oh, I'll be selling that to you.
[126:05.98]Don't you think that's kind of sad, though?
[126:07.18]He's doing all this work and he picks up a shield.
[126:09.10]Wow, that's way better than what I have.
[126:11.72]I have to buy this from the person that's standing cowering behind me.
[126:30.27]Why do we pretend kings hold all the power?
[126:34.55]Souvenir charm!
[126:49.94]Double swing.
[126:50.92]Ooh, unidentified ingredient.
[126:54.32]What's my highest stat in real life?
[126:57.90]Um, I can chug wicked fast.
[127:10.83]Okay.
[127:19.89]Watch out!
[127:21.73]Shark fins.
[127:23.49]A +2 shark fin.
[127:36.40]What can I do faster?
[127:37.28]Drink or pee?
[127:39.60]Uh... There is a limit to how fast you can pee.
[127:43.18]So... I don't know what you're talking about.
[127:56.92]Got another cape, yeah.
[127:59.16]It's a good day for a cape.
[128:02.49]Four, three, two, one, okay!
[128:20.71]What's my highest stat in real life?
[128:23.69]My ability to take bullshit, you know what I mean?
[128:52.56]What's my highest stat in real life?
[128:54.38]My ability to, like, give no fucks.
[129:00.10]Come here!
[129:08.11]What?
[129:08.41]What just happened?
[129:22.30]What's my element?
[129:23.40]Fire.
[129:26.04]I'm like really unpredictable and fucking uncontrollable.
[129:32.45]You can't -2 because of the spam filter.
[129:52.04]That means it's happening so often that you can't even type it.
[129:56.82]You're being, like, fenced.
[129:59.81]You're being, like, fenced in.
[130:02.55]You can't do it.
[130:07.03]No, that doesn't mean everybody do it.
[130:10.80]That's not fair.
[130:12.12]Delete that.
[130:13.00]That's not fair.
[130:29.84]Can't carry anymore.
[130:30.82]Uh-oh.
[130:33.90]I'm gonna use something.
[130:34.90]What does slime do?
[130:35.60]Can you eat the slime?
[130:40.13]No.
[130:41.95]Eat the bread.
[130:46.13]We're almost done.
[130:53.05]We're almost at the bottom of this tutorial 2.
[131:08.12]Comedy meter is crashing.
[131:09.36]Yeah, you guys are deliberately crashing it.
[131:13.26]Everyone's deliberately.
[131:14.30]That's why it can't be used as a real barometer.
[131:19.09]Just open it.
[131:27.66]You guys are the guys that go to the movie you've seen three times already and react the whole time.
[131:34.48]And like talk shit about all the scenes that are about to pop up to your friends.
[131:38.15]And everybody around you can hear you.
[131:39.93]There's nothing worth... You've already seen it.
[131:42.23]You don't have to do the -2 shit again.
[131:43.93]I need to get rid of stuff.
[131:59.62]The slimes are... The slimes don't do anything.
[132:01.54]I don't think I want to do it anymore.
[132:04.24]I want the slimes to be gone.
[132:07.10]We got a comet shield, cape... The statues are dumb too.
[132:13.25]Oh!
[132:13.89]Oh, by the way, everybody.
[132:16.35]Did anybody see on the front page of Reddit the other day?
[132:20.17]I can't even... You couldn't write this shit.
[132:22.51]They had the differences between jelly, jello, and jam.
[132:27.74]it was fucking everywhere and I was right everyone was talking about this and I was right everybody talked so much shit about everything I was saying and then it turns out what do you know the guy with the plus 10 intelligence you wonder what stat it was jelly is gelatin I can't even fucking believe it
[132:58.06]Everyone was like, no, that's actually not what it is!
[132:59.94]Oh, I got a hat.
[133:14.93]I saw that.
[133:15.35]I was laughing my ass off.
[133:18.11]I was lying down just like, you gotta be kidding me.
[133:21.75]Why would that be there?
[133:26.25]But I'm so glad, because I've been absolved of all the things everyone thought I was so stupid.
[133:31.01]And there it is.
[133:32.53]The explanation for what all of them are.
[133:37.03]Uh-oh, bomb.
[133:55.17]Dammit, I can't carry anymore.
[133:58.17]What have I get rid of?
[134:03.25]The unthinkable statue, whatever it is.
[134:04.91]Just get rid of it.
[134:10.55]They're only worth $140.
[134:11.40]I think bread can sell for more than that.
[134:23.35]I'm not the original poster.
[134:24.55]I agree with the post.
[134:32.22]What's this?
[134:32.52]A melon?
[134:37.20]What's this crap?
[134:40.13]These shrooms are crap.
[134:43.13]This walnut bread is crap.
[134:47.51]Just eat it.
[134:51.17]Orange.
[135:05.89]Pick me up that.
[135:06.73]Alright, that's good.
[135:11.45]Fifth floor is the end of this one.
[135:14.91]Although I think I can go up, but whatever.
[135:17.27]Uh-oh.
[135:18.51]The crown slime.
[135:19.87]Lord of slime.
[135:22.05]This is a boss.
[135:24.76]Watch it.
[135:27.32]One damage.
[135:28.66]Can I even hurt this thing?
[135:29.76]This is gonna kill me.
[135:30.74]Uh-oh.
[135:39.38]22.
[135:39.62]Oh shit.
[135:43.78]Okay, you gotta break him up.
[135:45.26]I get it.
[135:45.68]Break him up.
[135:47.82]Oh fuck.
[135:51.84]First real challenge.
[136:11.70]Two.
[136:12.02]Don't get gritty.
[136:12.75]Only two swings.
[136:17.17]Jump again.
[136:20.69]I can do three.
[136:24.21]He's gonna die to the easiest boss.
[136:26.27]Don't say that!
[136:29.20]Then it becomes a reality.
[136:33.42]Got it.
[136:34.98]Nice.
[136:38.16]Ooh, and you made it.
[136:39.36]No, uh, chest?
[136:43.74]I'm not gonna die to Slime Wheel.
[136:49.24]Nice, okay.
[136:50.76]I got a lot of stuff, so let's go down.
[136:53.84]Yeah, I got a lot.
[136:58.37]This, yeah, 1200.
[136:59.31]What else did I get?
[137:02.23]These Shock Fins are worth a lot.
[137:04.27]Powerful Anti-Venom.
[137:07.61]Slime Fluid, Slime Fluid, Fur Ball.
[137:11.58]Powerful antivenom, wool hat, insect trap.
[137:17.88]This stuff kind of sucks.
[137:21.98]But... Let's go to the pub.
[137:27.55]What is it?
[137:28.89]Satyr?
[137:29.37]Is alcohol yummy?
[137:33.71]I've only tried it once before myself.
[137:36.71]Really?
[137:36.95]Wow, you're so grown up.
[137:39.31]I hated it.
[137:39.85]It stank of barrels.
[137:42.75]Typically, most alcoholic beverages are left to age in barrels.
[137:46.05]That's not true.
[137:49.33]So the drink had a strong wooden smell, and it was not dissimilar to attempting to drink a tree.
[137:53.47]That's not true.
[138:02.70]Okay, that doesn't sound yummy at all.
[138:05.34]To be honest, the popularity of the substance baffles me.
[138:07.84]It always sells well, so stocking it is always a good way to make some money.
[138:12.71]But... But barrels.
[138:16.33]Barrels.
[138:16.77]That was a pretty good joke.
[138:26.37]We can go to the market.
[138:27.19]We can go... Let's go... So how do I get alcohol?
[138:33.26]Let's head back here.
[138:34.10]Because I want to set up my shop again.
[138:35.60]Here we go.
[138:35.90]Let's do shark fin.
[138:41.60]Where's my shark fins?
[138:47.37]Excuse me, get out of my way.
[138:53.01]I also want to get rid of the, uh... Get the armband up there.
[138:56.55]No, no, that thing's terrible.
[139:02.19]I need to sell these capes.
[139:06.45]I'm gonna keep the shield.
[139:10.15]Take a shot for every drink you sell.
[139:12.90]It's not that kind of night.
[139:14.60]Alright, what else do I got?
[139:18.94]More capes?
[139:19.68]No, let's take them off.
[139:20.62]Let's only have two, because people will think that we're oversupplied and be like, why are these not selling?
[139:26.20]Let's put the antivenom out here too.
[139:32.72]Insect trap, antivenom.
[139:34.22]Chocolate bar.
[139:41.80]700 bucks for an orange.
[139:42.80]Alright, I get to put it in the shield.
[139:47.24]Why not?
[139:49.42]You're thinking too hard for an anime game.
[139:55.57]What?
[139:57.57]This is for sale, right?
[139:59.07]Yep, 600 bucks.
[140:00.95]Thank you.
[140:05.80]You put the food next to insect repellent.
[140:10.92]Yeah, but it's wrapped up.
[140:13.44]I could use some food.
[140:15.90]Really?
[140:17.24]Well, I got news for you.
[140:21.55]I got an orange here.
[140:23.05]Beef bowl!
[140:25.07]I've been trying to sell this for a while.
[140:27.59]Good choice.
[140:28.29]3,000 bucks.
[140:36.98]This guy doesn't fuck around, so I'm gonna go 104.
[140:44.08]Wow!
[140:45.97]That's kind of ridiculous.
[140:47.57]That guy, seriously.
[140:52.95]That was very, very reasonable.
[140:56.89]This is for sale, right?
[140:57.73]Yes, it is.
[141:01.07]Can you take it down a little bit?
[141:05.72]Thank you.
[141:09.07]You're trying to mega scam him.
[141:10.95]Oh, here we go.
[141:12.19]Can you sell me some food?
[141:14.33]I can.
[141:14.85]Ah, it's only been touched by four or five different people at this point.
[141:20.12]Should I just sell it at value?
[141:22.04]Nobody can afford this.
[141:41.05]Lower it.
[141:44.35]Undercharge this guy?
[141:45.59]2,400.
[141:45.61]Come on.
[142:09.37]Hey, I got plus 900.
[142:13.53]I'm fine.
[142:14.03]I'm gonna have to sell the thing at cost.
[142:18.43]Nobody wants it.
[142:19.12]It's too expensive.
[142:21.08]Nobody wants it.
[142:22.58]Nobody wants that stupid thing.
[142:28.00]Got a weapon.
[142:30.82]Nope, I don't.
[142:32.58]What?
[142:37.87]I bought it for a thousand.
[142:38.93]Yeah, but I want to maximize my profit.
[142:42.69]This'll do.
[142:43.25]$5.50.
[142:43.27]$7.50.
[142:43.29]$6.50.
[142:43.31]Good deal.
[142:48.47]Alright, I have enough money to pay my debt.
[142:59.66]Excuse me, miss.
[143:00.44]I just got stung by a scorpion outside.
[143:03.00]Can you help me?
[143:05.03]My daughter-in-law asked me to pick this up.
[143:06.87]Two thousand.
[143:09.52]Hmm.
[143:11.98]Should we just try to do it for 150?
[143:22.59]Yes!
[143:28.51]Just a hair- I'm too scared.
[143:30.77]I need the money.
[143:38.88]Okay, how we doing?
[143:40.68]How many days do I got?
[143:41.30]I got two days.
[143:41.92]I need a little bit more money.
[143:46.26]I need to sell this fucking beef.
[143:51.93]Somebody buy this.
[143:52.87]And no one's buying any capes either.
[143:55.43]I need a weapon.
[143:56.01]Alright, let me go get a weapon.
[143:58.13]I still have plenty of time.
[144:00.63]Uh, the market, right?
[144:06.12]No, no, it's like the adventurer's guild, right?
[144:09.10]Or the merchant's guild.
[144:11.22]There we go.
[144:12.36]Worn sword.
[144:13.30]That's all he has.
[144:14.58]Daggers.
[144:15.06]I could get a dagger.
[144:16.72]Crafter's knife.
[144:18.14]Staff.
[144:18.60]Magician's staff.
[144:19.56]Maybe I could get a longbow.
[144:24.04]Spears.
[144:24.60]Ooh, iron spear.
[144:29.27]Yeah, I'm gonna get an iron spear.
[144:37.41]And...
[144:40.62]Armor.
[144:42.79]Iron armor.
[144:51.33]Alright, get this shit out of here.
[144:55.01]Get the spear in the window.
[144:55.97]Get the armor in the window.
[144:59.62]Keep the beef there, keep the shark fin there.
[145:03.62]Move this armband.
[145:04.38]Nobody wants this.
[145:09.70]So many of these dumb capes.
[145:14.81]What was I thinking?
[145:16.07]Alright, let's go.
[145:23.83]Put the beefball on the floor.
[145:26.32]The wife's been up in my shorts about getting a weapon.
[145:30.36]Really?
[145:31.60]Well... How about an iron spear?
[145:37.12]Perfect!
[145:45.15]Don't have the money on you.
[145:46.15]2000.
[145:48.27]No, no, no, no.
[145:51.99]Like 1999.
[145:52.47]There it is.
[145:56.43]What?
[145:57.17]No matter how you slice it, that's unreasonable.
[145:59.12]You're back.
[146:04.06]The wife's been up my shorts about getting so old.
[146:05.92]By the way, I forgot.
[146:08.56]I just told you to fuck off and left the store, but... Oh, shit!
[146:12.65]I have... I gotta buy food.
[146:14.69]And this is the only store, and I really didn't feel like putting in the GPS, like, the nearest grocery store, like, eight miles away.
[146:20.05]Uh, you got any food?
[146:21.93]How about this?
[146:29.09]How much do you want?
[146:36.35]Oh my god, I have to sell this at a loss.
[146:41.76]Nobody wants this.
[146:50.88]Nobody has any money to buy that beef bowl.
[146:54.20]What's going on?
[146:54.83]Do you have a book?
[147:01.55]I don't have any books.
[147:03.35]Go to the library.
[147:11.79]Hey, this item is for sale, right?
[147:15.25]Ooh, defense.
[147:16.19]33 to 36.
[147:16.99]It is for sale.
[147:20.84]And just for you, I'll make sure to give you a good price on it.
[147:23.28]And now you're going to be wearing it.
[147:32.54]Oh, additional dude?
[147:33.56]What are you going to use that for?
[147:37.04]Grandpa always has a lot of money.
[147:40.25]Oh, there we go.
[147:40.89]Yeah, I'm a loaded fucking millionaire.
[147:43.19]I just felt like owning this and potentially throwing it out of my window on random stuff.
[147:48.93]Thank you.
[147:52.95]Grandpa always has money.
[147:54.03]I was gonna say, oh, by the way, I need bread, too.
[148:00.05]Remember that guy that came in here and talked shit about food?
[148:02.69]Well, that's alright.
[148:03.53]I'll buy what he was gonna get.
[148:06.54]Hey, Grandpa.
[148:07.78]Thanks for being a good customer.
[148:13.17]Take care of them.
[148:13.91]Take care of the customers that take care of you.
[148:23.47]That's how they get you.
[148:24.91]They throw in the thing that's free.
[148:26.93]That is meaningless.
[148:29.73]You want to buy the vacuum cleaner?
[148:31.31]The $400-$500 vacuum cleaner?
[148:33.63]Oh, but just wait.
[148:34.65]We'll throw in a new shower head rack.
[148:37.17]Absolutely free.
[148:38.15]That thing's fucking stupid.
[148:40.55]That's going to just be in your closet.
[148:41.93]You're not going to use it.
[148:46.85]I just did that with the bread.
[148:52.45]Alright, it's too late to do anything else, so I think I'm ready for bed.
[149:00.91]No, I still got time.
[149:02.05]We can do one more.
[149:02.81]Let's go.
[149:03.05]Hello.
[149:14.11]Working hard.
[149:14.75]Reset.
[149:15.17]Oh, take this.
[149:16.11]Common shield.
[149:20.10]Right.
[149:20.32]Then I'd call that a fair deal.
[149:22.92]Thanks.
[149:24.28]Wait.
[149:24.62]I know.
[149:24.88]I don't want... I just sold it to the other guy.
[149:27.34]Got any weapons?
[149:30.92]Nope.
[149:31.62]Sorry.
[149:31.96]I just lost my last weapon.
[149:33.30]Good night.
[149:36.82]Good night.
[149:45.27]$4,500 in profit.
[149:47.64]Exceeded expectations.
[149:53.52]Day 7.
[149:56.46]So, when do I have to pay?
[149:57.80]Tomorrow is the debt.
[149:58.84]I had to pay 10,000.
[149:59.44]I need to go get another weapon.
[150:03.72]Uh, how about a magician's staff?
[150:14.61]Laundry pole?
[150:19.47]That's... I don't... I mean, at that point, you just start punching people.
[150:26.63]Shield.
[150:27.09]Maybe buy another common shield.
[150:29.48]Common shield.
[150:31.54]And a crafter's knife.
[150:35.60]And let's get magician's staff.
[150:45.37]Anything else to talk about?
[150:46.23]No.
[150:49.24]Get the cheap items?
[150:49.98]No, you buy huge and you sell huge.
[150:55.00]No, I'm going to put... I'm going to put the magician staff out.
[151:05.83]I need to get rid of this beef.
[151:07.01]I was going to sell this at like a 50% base loss.
[151:09.31]I don't even care.
[151:10.03]Okay.
[151:18.13]What should I do?
[151:19.53]I'll return it to you.
[151:22.19]Konnichiwa.
[151:22.81]Hey, it's me.
[151:25.85]Would you mind selling me this?
[151:27.71]How much do you want?
[151:33.57]Thank you.
[151:33.91]Thank you.
[151:34.87]I spent a thousand dollars on it.
[151:36.23]I got a five hundred dollar profit.
[151:37.17]I don't care.
[151:38.81]It's sold.
[151:42.53]Welcome.
[151:44.23]I was looking for this.
[151:45.35]How much do you want?
[151:48.92]135.
[151:49.06]A little bit less?
[151:52.26]I could.
[151:57.44]Craft his knife.
[152:00.70]Hi there, what can I get you?
[152:02.76]Ooh, wooden armband.
[152:04.52]So this is the legendary Reset.
[152:06.86]Sell me this.
[152:07.42]Don't you already have one of these?
[152:14.36]You already have one.
[152:20.30]Get the fuck out of here.
[152:23.74]Ooh, insect trap.
[152:24.24]I've never sold an insect trap before.
[152:25.92]Let's just do a reasonable 150.
[152:48.77]Jerma, you suck.
[152:50.25]I just sold three items in a row.
[152:52.81]For more than I paid for them.
[152:57.91]What are you talking about?
[152:59.17]I did very good right there.
[153:00.39]That was very well done.
[153:03.59]Fourteen hundred.
[153:04.49]Fourteen thousand.
[153:08.47]Get one of these dumb capes.
[153:09.97]There's already a cape up here.
[153:12.89]How much is this stuff worth?
[153:15.92]Put the Anti-Venom up there.
[153:16.98]It sells.
[153:17.40]People usually buy it.
[153:18.42]There's a shield in there, too.
[153:20.94]Super new charm.
[153:25.84]Just put the capes fucking everywhere.
[153:27.48]I don't care anymore about these capes.
[153:31.84]We're open!
[153:35.18]Ooh.
[153:37.10]I don't suppose you have a piece of armor?
[153:39.88]Oh, but I do, my friend.
[153:45.97]36 to 40, 15.
[153:46.17]So I... That's a good one.
[153:50.52]Yes, it is.
[153:52.66]Alright, so how much money do you have?
[153:57.54]How much did I buy this for?
[153:58.54]I bought this for... Like 900, is it?
[154:04.36]1000?
[154:04.38]This guy's broke.
[154:12.33]Alright, I bought it for 900.
[154:15.45]Oh god damn it!
[154:32.79]But this is the armor that I'm going to be using!
[154:48.33]I make out there.
[154:48.91]It's fine.
[154:50.45]I sold it at a loss, but I get to use the armor.
[154:53.69]Don't worry.
[154:58.71]I'll make it all back.
[154:59.47]My grandpa's fucking trillion dollar estate.
[155:02.01]Would you mind selling me this weird fucked up item that I could just put on a shelf in a bathroom somewhere? ...
[155:23.89]Hey, I'm back again.
[155:25.64]I'm thinking about getting a shield, too.
[155:27.96]I'm thinking of throwing the spear out the window.
[155:31.48]You know, the one I just bought from you?
[155:33.54]And then going down my elevator and running out the front door and blocking it with the shield.
[155:40.46]I mean, I've lived like 600 stories up.
[155:42.62]I think it's possible.
[155:44.20]And I'm going to make a YouTube video on it.
[155:46.82]And it's through slow motion.
[155:50.10]That sounds like a really cool video idea.
[155:53.25]Ah, that's too expensive!
[155:58.56]Ah, fine!
[156:05.32]Mmm, this is a present for Mommy.
[156:10.66]This girl is hard to sell, too.
[156:12.16]Let's just go with, like... Let's go with, like, 103.
[156:14.58]Alright, you'll pay.
[156:21.70]I'm doing pretty good on money.
[156:27.56]I don't know.
[156:27.88]I can do one more run on the store here.
[156:31.07]Fur ball.
[156:31.77]I'm kind of running out of items.
[156:36.71]I have so many capes.
[156:41.23]I'll never sell them, those capes.
[156:42.85]I'm going to hold those capes to zero.
[156:44.43]What do you want?
[156:55.25]Put the garbage out.
[156:57.07]Wait, hold on.
[156:59.65]How are we doing, like, politically here?
[157:10.94]Alright, keep that there.
[157:12.82]Let's get the cape.
[157:14.04]Look, okay, here's the thing.
[157:16.91]You wanna know my strategy right now?
[157:18.65]Here's the strategy.
[157:19.45]There's only capes in the store.
[157:25.04]So... you have to buy one if that's the only thing we have.
[157:30.04]Right?
[157:30.26]I was walking by and I noticed you had- the wife asked me to get some food.
[157:50.64]Mmm, perfect.
[157:52.84]Bread.
[157:55.98]Seems about right.
[158:00.45]Any capes?
[158:03.31]Uh... You don't have some food, do you?
[158:05.89]You need more food.
[158:10.55]Did you eat it before you left?
[158:11.83]Oh, I screwed it up again!
[158:15.95]Oh, boy!
[158:18.43]I was supposed to bring that food back to the wife and I ate it before I left the store!
[158:22.90]I wouldn't have any food.
[158:36.86]Alright, time to pay the debt.
[158:41.20]I have enough.
[158:48.72]Should I just, like, tie the capes together and sell it as a parachute?
[158:55.11]I mean, look, if you want to be a good entrepreneur and a good businessman, businesswoman, you adapt.
[159:03.13]Those are all $2,000 each.
[159:05.02]No, capes are boring, but if you tie them together and you make a giant parachute for 10 grand, all of a sudden, it's really interesting.
[159:15.87]Uh, incidentally, you are aware that today is the first day of collections.
[159:19.49]Hey, what?
[159:21.65]As in pay up or we take your house?
[159:26.41]Let's see.
[159:26.85]I have a calendar that I can check when I'm on a break, don't I?
[159:29.65]Oh, in the main menu.
[159:30.73]I bet you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[159:32.08]I knew it was the day.
[159:35.80]The amount is scheduled to increase every week.
[159:39.46]What?
[159:39.68]What?
[159:44.24]What kind of interest rate?
[159:46.42]I have a scaling interest rate?
[159:48.50]Isn't that illegal?
[159:53.54]I have a completely always never-ending scaling upwards interest rate.
[160:04.05]What the fuck is up with that?
[160:05.31]Alright.
[160:06.69]We got capes here.
[160:07.47]Got it.
[160:14.73]I heard that there was potentially parachutes here.
[160:18.69]Is that possible to see them?
[160:21.77]Ooh, thank you.
[160:26.49]See, my twin brother came in here and told me that there were parachutes available.
[160:30.93]I want one too, because that fucking asshole, we're like the Twix brothers.
[160:35.57]When he does something cool, I do it even cooler.
[160:38.89]He's gonna jump off his roof with this on, so I'm gonna do that too.
[160:47.17]How much do you want?
[160:51.46]Thank you very much!
[160:52.34]It's sold!
[160:54.48]Which one should I buy?
[160:58.34]What should I buy?
[161:21.11]I get the magician's staff.
[161:22.17]Let's get it up there.
[161:22.87]Alright, I'm just gonna dump this stuff.
[161:25.31]This stuff sucks.
[161:26.79]I'm not gonna buy any more capes.
[161:28.13]Look, it's debt day.
[161:30.77]Wait, wait, wait!
[161:32.12]I tell you, I have a whole family of fucking old Twix people.
[161:36.40]I want one too!
[161:44.90]Thank you!
[161:48.38]Hey!
[161:49.76]Some of my brothers came in here.
[161:52.08]But what they don't understand is I'm the fucking evil one.
[161:55.69]They're all buying capes.
[161:57.17]I'm gonna buy the staff.
[161:58.93]And right before they all jump off, I'm gonna delete with a magical spell their capes off their backs and they just hit the ground.
[162:06.29]And then I will own the whole old fucking Twix family factory.
[162:12.30]Thank you very much.
[162:12.98]It's sold.
[162:21.96]Beef bowl?
[162:22.80]Oh, do you want me to sell this?
[162:30.64]How much do I... I don't want that.
[162:32.86]How do I not pay for this?
[162:34.13]I don't want this.
[162:38.33]I don't want this.
[162:38.99]It doesn't sell.
[162:39.51]Here, I'll do it for a thousand.
[162:47.41]Yes, it's that cheap.
[162:49.46]Look, I'll throw in five cents.
[162:53.78]Did I just get fucking scammed?
[162:55.66]I think I did.
[162:56.66]I think I just got scammed.
[162:59.14]I shouldn't have done that.
[163:02.32]Fuck.
[163:04.96]I don't want the beef bowl.
[163:06.34]Hold on.
[163:13.17]Let's get it up there.
[163:18.83]Chestnuts.
[163:20.41]Get the anti-venom up there.
[163:21.39]I got a lot of... I'm doing good on money.
[163:23.13]Hmm.
[163:23.31]Let's see, put the shrooms up here.
[163:31.01]Can I upgrade my store?
[163:32.93]It's me again.
[163:51.37]What else do you want me to say as the fucking old guy?
[163:54.45]What else is there to do?
[163:55.69]Hey, let me tell you, I can eat your bread for my twin Twix brothers.
[163:58.61]Bald?
[163:58.71]What do you mean?
[164:02.07]If I want some food, what would be good?
[164:07.87]Hmm.
[164:22.12]Hear me out on this, guys.
[164:23.62]I bought it for 1,500.
[164:27.99]Take profits when you can.
[164:28.97]I don't know what your goal here was with that.
[164:38.89]I was looking at one of these.
[164:48.72]That's so much.
[164:51.02]Oh, ooh.
[164:53.18]Okay.
[164:56.02]600 sounds good.
[164:57.78]Seems fair.
[165:00.36]$1,000 in profit.
[165:02.02]Just have to sell to the old man.
[165:05.73]You gotta sell to the old man that has, like, 10 kilos of gold in his house.
[165:11.09]And he just takes a razor and just shaves the top every day and buys it every once.
[165:23.64]Alright, I think it's time for bed.
[165:30.57]It's a plus four slime.
[165:34.75]I'm out of inventory.
[165:37.65]So, all we got is... You know what?
[165:39.49]Hold on.
[165:40.48]Let's go get a drink.
[165:45.57]What is it?
[165:46.97]Why are adventurers in the pub so often?
[165:49.15]Do they all like alcohol that much?
[165:51.49]Well, adventurers certainly do enjoy their liquid pleasure.
[165:54.67]But a pub like this also handles quests for adventurers, really.
[165:59.37]Many of the people here are looking for work.
[166:02.03]Isn't that kind of stuff handled by the Adventurers Guild?
[166:04.95]The guild does also handle some quests, but remember, you can only hire a guild adventurer officially if you possess the guild card of that person.
[166:12.61]Assuming they have one at all.
[166:14.64]Therefore, places like this tend to offer a different kind of quest, more daily, run-of-the-mill business, if you will.
[166:21.72]Clients do not pay as much as guild-sponsored ones, but this sort of place is also far friendlier to rookies.
[166:28.66]However, if the request is too simple or moronic, it is likely that no one will even attempt to do it.
[166:35.93]Look, the requests are posted up there on the wall.
[166:38.19]Let us have a look, shall we?
[166:40.39]Let's see.
[166:41.25]Please find my lost kitty.
[166:42.69]Can I hire someone to stand in a ticket line for me?
[166:45.39]Please kill ten crows around the garbage dump.
[166:48.27]Green item offered.
[166:50.23]Can one of you hot studs... Wow, there's quite a variety.
[166:56.12]While it's true that they are often used as glorified handymen, in a way this sort of thing is a sign of how much adventurers have blended into daily city life in this city.
[167:05.98]That's true.
[167:08.75]Hey, actually, we should do this quest.
[167:10.89]I mean, I'd love to help someone find their kitty.
[167:14.19]Uh, no.
[167:14.79]I'm afraid we cannot.
[167:16.11]While anyone can post a request, only those registered with the Adventurers Guild can legally take on such requests.
[167:23.27]So I'm afraid we cannot do anything listed here.
[167:26.65]That's a bummer.
[167:28.61]So why do we keep coming here?
[167:29.51]We're not even, like, old enough to go in here.
[167:34.91]How do we keep getting in the front door?
[167:42.64]Oh, I heard the door open.
[167:43.42]Who is it?
[167:44.44]Oh, it's two children.
[167:46.76]Two children.
[167:49.46]Well, whatever.
[167:49.80]I'm just going to go back to cleaning my glass.
[167:51.09]Save.
[167:55.49]I'll save.
[167:55.85]Ooh, $10,000 in profit.
[167:56.91]Okay.
[168:08.42]No, my money!
[168:09.18]My money!
[168:11.30]Where's my money going?
[168:14.84]$10,000 in debt has been repaid.
[168:16.90]So this is the payment for the week.
[168:18.27]Let me see.
[168:20.33]Congratulations.
[168:21.09]Well done.
[168:21.55]30% of your money is now gone.
[168:22.49]I did it.
[168:36.06]I did it.
[168:36.94]I did it.
[168:37.52]I worked really hard to delete 35% of my money.
[168:41.57]I did it!
[168:48.41]So this is it.
[168:55.04]That insolent little plebeian shop which is the focus of so much rumor.
[169:01.16]My, my, my, it's so common, so dirty, so dull.
[169:05.29]How does that little pro get people to come in, I wonder?
[169:10.45]Well, no matter.
[169:12.07]This is the perfect opportunity to show that little shrew and this whole city what a truly elegant shop is like.
[169:22.09]We all get fairies.
[169:23.15]Oh, you know, you don't own that store yet, right?
[169:27.06]It belongs to your parents.
[169:29.47]Silence, you insolent fairy.
[169:31.39]It'll be mine eventually.
[169:33.35]That's practically the same thing.
[169:39.22]A little shop.
[169:41.78]Your days are numbered.
[169:42.56]Let's see it.
[169:48.56]I'm gonna go pee.
[169:52.36]And I told you to address me as young mistress.
[169:58.15]Day nine.
[169:59.23]Alright, whoa, whoa, whoa, hey, hey, wait, what is that?
[170:03.05]Something's alive in there.
[170:07.44]Ah, Colonel.
[170:13.84]My genius astounds even me sometimes.
[170:16.98]The best way to learn about your foe is direct infiltration, after all.
[170:20.12]That's an Amazon box.
[170:23.43]And with strategic espionage abilities such as this, I can't fail.
[170:27.54]Who's under that box?
[170:29.58]Um, who's that?
[170:32.32]The interior decoration is as seedy and plebeian as the outside, which means their selection of items will be astounding.
[170:38.05]What could it be?
[170:38.65]What sort of thing could that filthy little pearl sell?
[170:41.71]Perhaps some kind of black and white animal, the ownership of which violates international treaties.
[170:47.14]A zebra?
[170:47.98]Perhaps the most delicious apples this side of Mare de Blanc.
[170:52.14]Perhaps one of those books Father says I'm too young to read.
[171:00.45]Um... Oh, be quiet, whoever you are.
[171:05.28]I've been found out.
[171:06.02]Could you go out of that box?
[171:11.28]Kind of looks weird.
[171:16.62]What?
[171:17.86]Well then.
[171:24.61]Oh.
[171:25.32]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[171:27.12]In all honesty, I shouldn't be surprised by this.
[171:30.44]I should have expected a foe as canny as you to break through my otherwise impenetrable stealth techniques.
[171:38.17]Okay.
[171:40.25]This confirms it.
[171:41.21]You are indeed worthy of being my rival.
[171:45.59]Hiwa rival.
[171:48.33]Oh, sorry, sorry.
[171:49.45]Let me redo that again.
[171:50.19]Huh?
[171:53.97]Oh, I have failed to introduce myself, of course.
[171:56.04]I am the owner of the monolithic item store chain, Big Bash.
[172:01.36]Tim Allen.
[172:10.65]Well, to be specific, I am the owner's only child and inheritor.
[172:15.34]Alouette is my name.
[172:16.70]Remember it.
[172:17.48]I won't.
[172:18.70]Everyone around me calls me Young Mistress Alouette.
[172:24.11]But you, oh, my rival, shall have the privilege of calling me Lady Alouette.
[172:31.11]Tim Alouette of Big Bash?
[172:36.48]It is a massive store chain with a capital stock value of 15 billion piks and a yearly gross profit of 500 billion.
[172:45.51]Ooh, that's a lot.
[172:46.49]I heard the commotion and came to see what was happening, but why are the two of you discussing Big Bash?
[172:52.64]I'm, uh, not really sure.
[172:55.18]Interesting, you also have a fairy.
[172:57.72]Huh?
[172:59.34]Prime.
[173:01.04]Alouette Prime.
[173:02.70]It's how we get our boxes really fa- It's an Amazon thing.
[173:08.06]Yeah, yeah, what's up?
[173:12.55]Oh, oh, mistress, I see your attempt at infiltration failed.
[173:16.58]Well, what are you talking about?
[173:17.42]Their superior detection ability simply caught me off guard and overwhelmed my cardboard, that's all.
[173:23.12]That's a fairy.
[173:27.03]Dang, this one sure is sharp.
[173:28.55]You got a problem with that, kid?
[173:31.43]I mean, you hang out with one too, so what's the big deal?
[173:36.11]Call me Prime.
[173:37.07]You could say I'm Allure, the mistress's guardian.
[173:42.55]Uh, well, I'm Reset, and this is Tyr.
[173:44.93]It's nice to meet you.
[173:45.69]Mmm.
[173:48.17]Yeah, real pleasure to meet you too, bookworm!
[173:55.16]Dork geek!
[173:56.06]Nerd dork!
[173:57.54]Uh, are you by chance referring to me?
[173:58.92]Psh, like there's anyone else here I'd call that.
[174:04.61]Well, the pleasure are all mine, then.
[174:07.57]Alright, mistress, we've introduced ourselves.
[174:09.79]So how about we head on home?
[174:12.27]What are you talking about?
[174:13.21]I haven't finished introducing half of the fantabalistic, amazing incredibleness that is Alouette, inheritor of Big Bash.
[174:24.17]Shh, if we stick around for that, we'll be here all week.
[174:26.89]Come on now, we're going home.
[174:30.13]Lucette?
[174:31.95]Reset.
[174:32.87]Listen.
[174:33.59]And listen well.
[174:35.01]Enjoy your happy, carefree days as long as you can.
[174:38.53]For when I am through with you... Hey, hey.
[174:41.83]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[174:42.86]See you guys around.
[174:46.06]She's doing these little like... See?
[174:48.72]What?
[174:50.86]What?
[174:58.15]What do you think that was all about?
[174:59.83]She's still here.
[175:00.39]That was not dissimilar to meeting a hurricane in human form.
[175:07.79]Oh, now she's gone.
[175:10.07]Alright, time to save and time to pee.
[175:15.12]I'll be right back.
[175:19.80]Enjoy the music.
[177:42.81]you
[178:36.80]Hello.
[178:40.70]How are you doing?
[178:41.34]So we got, next we've got $30,000.
[178:47.27]As you can see here.
[178:54.27]Well, in more than a week.
[178:57.06]How was the pee?
[178:57.54]The pee was good.
[178:58.04]I just grabbed a little soda.
[179:04.52]Alright, I need to do some more adventuring.
[179:06.90]I gotta get this guy a better sword, though.
[179:12.80]Yeah, this inventory is terrible.
[179:17.95]Let me go back here.
[179:21.61]Where is her store gonna be?
[179:27.27]Buy.
[179:27.75]Give me a steel sword.
[179:32.13]This thing is... He uses... I'm getting it.
[179:38.15]Pretty wand.
[179:41.59]Bows, composite bow, practice lance.
[179:47.56]I think I'm just gonna buy a bunch of equipment and let him have it.
[179:51.12]For very, very cheap.
[179:52.88]He has the armor.
[179:56.16]He's got iron armor.
[179:57.70]He's got iron armband and wooden armband.
[179:59.48]He doesn't have a shield, though.
[180:00.64]Big shield.
[180:05.44]He has the hat.
[180:07.22]Maybe he could use a helm.
[180:08.64]Alright, let me... I don't want to spend that much money.
[180:11.25]I'm going to buy another longsword.
[180:12.41]I'm going to buy... I still have a staff.
[180:19.69]You going into the red?
[180:20.81]No, I'll be fine.
[180:25.80]Oh, he's the girl.
[180:26.74]The little girl.
[180:27.16]Wow.
[180:28.52]Is that a laugh or is it a cry?
[180:29.66]Hey, what's wrong?
[180:33.80]My dolly.
[180:36.98]Oh, the shoulder's been ripped.
[180:39.68]This is my favorite.
[180:40.65]Hey, wait, can you give that to me for a second?
[180:45.83]Okay.
[180:47.13]Let me see.
[180:47.49]I have a little thread and a needle in my apron pocket here.
[180:51.03]And loop, loop.
[180:52.27]Don't poke myself.
[180:55.09]Hey, and done.
[180:56.87]How does that look?
[180:59.11]You fixed her!
[180:59.93]Yay!
[181:00.67]Thank you so much, lady.
[181:02.39]You're welcome.
[181:03.41]That'll be $60 for materials and $20 for labor.
[181:07.02]And if you don't pay it, then I'm coming after you and your whole family.
[181:11.76]Okay, then.
[181:15.78]See you in court.
[181:18.57]You're good at sign crafting, but you're fairly deft hand at needlework, too.
[181:23.68]How about you, Tira?
[181:24.68]I bet you sew a lot of stuff.
[181:28.04]Uh, no.
[181:28.92]There is no time for dawdling.
[181:31.54]Where to next?
[181:32.34]We're gonna get, like, some weird exposition here.
[181:34.91]There's gonna be an entire... Shoot, where did chat go?
[181:41.45]Where's the chat?
[181:43.21]Did I accidentally close the chat window?
[181:45.77]I think I did.
[181:47.55]Well, I'm stupid.
[181:49.28]Hey, there you guys are.
[181:49.92]Hi.
[181:51.98]I got you back.
[181:53.99]Alright, I guess fairies aren't very good at using big needles, huh?
[182:00.83]I don't think so.
[182:01.43]I guess not.
[182:01.85]Alright, let's go put this inventory up.
[182:06.16]Keep the cloak.
[182:07.28]Let's get the steel sword.
[182:08.50]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[182:09.50]Long sword.
[182:09.98]And... What is the... Oh, no, I already... I sold the magician's catalyst device.
[182:24.69]I need more stuff.
[182:26.77]I need more stuff.
[182:30.70]Uh, let's go with... Tre- Tree Seed Necklace?
[182:34.74]I'll take two of them.
[182:38.22]Adventurer's Cape!
[182:40.14]That's an even better- That's an even cooler cape.
[182:50.56]Ooh!
[182:51.81]This ring's power enhances the wearer's willpower, allowing him to shrug off physical blows.
[182:58.21]Thankful... Wait.
[182:59.35]Unthankful statue.
[183:01.75]Un... And a thankful statue.
[183:03.89]Unthankful... What?
[183:11.11]Somebody wanted a book too, right?
[183:16.57]Alright, watermelons.
[183:20.00]And let's get a few cherries.
[183:23.63]Okay.
[183:24.91]I got great inventory now.
[183:27.89]By the way... I don't even want this shit anymore.
[183:36.11]I don't want it on the... I don't want it on the shelf.
[183:52.81]Now I got good inventory.
[183:53.95]Let me... Let me get rid of this other crap.
[183:57.63]Out.
[183:59.65]Out of the way.
[184:00.65]I need to do a dungeon run?
[184:06.96]I will, I will.
[184:07.80]Alright, we got... Let's get... What do we want in the window?
[184:13.28]Let's get the necklace in the window.
[184:16.10]Let's get the adventurer's cape in the window.
[184:18.11]5200 fucking bucks.
[184:21.03]Thankful statue.
[184:23.28]Backscratcher?
[184:27.19]Couple of books?
[184:28.49]No, I want the books over here.
[184:30.05]Nah, the books can be over here.
[184:31.33]I want the food on the left.
[184:32.33]Okay, then... Insect trap.
[184:40.09]Food.
[184:41.39]Get the watermelon.
[184:43.09]And the cherries.
[184:49.14]I think that's pretty good.
[184:50.38]Although maybe I want the thankful statue up here.
[184:57.34]I think that's fine.
[184:58.10]Let's go.
[184:58.40]Let's make some money.
[184:59.46]I've been looking for one of these.
[185:05.60]Cherry.
[185:05.98]1100.
[185:06.02]Profit.
[185:06.24]Welcome.
[185:08.10]Long sword.
[185:08.51]Those don't come cheap.
[185:11.75]Pretty good deal.
[185:15.25]Thank you.
[185:28.22]Those are hard to get.
[185:28.88]Ooh.
[185:31.94]Piece of armor.
[185:32.70]You already have armor.
[185:36.13]He's wearing iron armor right now.
[185:39.39]No, go home.
[185:45.07]Wait, cape is armor.
[185:47.49]No, it's not.
[185:49.01]Cape's not armor.
[185:55.27]This armor is iron armor.
[185:58.21]Leather armor.
[185:59.35]I mean, yes, in literal terms, you'd be correct, but not in the literal sense of this game.
[186:09.26]You want the necklace.
[186:10.00]Thousand bucks.
[186:11.36]Should I just go absolutely fucking crazy and just see if I can get two thousand?
[186:24.93]I started ridiculous and brought it down to an even more ridiculous than it because that was the first number was fake.
[186:34.83]You got your bluff call.
[186:38.33]When she died, my grandmother told me to sell this off if I ever got into trouble.
[186:45.36]Okay, so I'll give it to you for 900.
[186:52.32]Your grandmother left you a candy apple.
[186:55.21]That's not... That's not a great inheritance.
[187:01.59]My husband had this hidden in his den.
[187:07.36]I'll give you 500 bucks for it.
[187:09.30]650 is all I'm willing to part with here.
[187:15.65]No, it's not worth talking to you either.
[187:16.89]I can't sell those.
[187:23.75]Would you sell this to me?
[187:24.87]Finally, the cape.
[187:28.15]All the capes are gone!
[187:30.27]I did it!
[187:30.71]I made like 100% of my money back with all those capes.
[187:36.02]Everybody told me I was dumb.
[187:37.76]You gotta do the long con.
[187:43.42]Okay, what else?
[187:43.84]Do I have any more?
[187:44.30]Get a candy apple up there.
[187:50.35]I want the steel sword.
[187:57.93]I really, really, really want to give that steel... I want him to buy it.
[188:04.61]Have fun with the $30,000 payment.
[188:05.59]Yeah, it's like next week.
[188:08.02]I got plenty of time.
[188:11.88]You want the unthankful statue. $135,000.
[188:24.09]Candy apple.
[188:26.67]You know what?
[188:27.01]I thought about it.
[188:28.79]I really want it back.
[188:36.04]In the green.
[188:37.14]I'm probably going to be in the green for the day.
[188:38.56]Alright, here we go.
[188:40.90]I really don't want to sell this, but... I don't want to buy this.
[188:46.98]Oh, we both can agree on that.
[188:54.02]That's a pretty good deal.
[188:55.20]50% off.
[188:55.42]Another necklace?
[188:55.96]140.
[188:55.98]That's a bit expensive.
[188:56.70]Yeah, you're right.
[188:57.44]125.
[188:57.46]1250.
[188:58.38]Anybody else?
[189:23.67]Cherries?
[189:24.03]1200.
[189:24.05]Just a little bit less.
[189:25.07]1179.
[189:25.45]Whatever.
[189:25.63]Why are you guys saying chewy?
[189:46.69]Minus $60.
[189:47.11]It's alright, but I have a... That... I spent like... $16,000 or $17,000.
[189:53.03]News.
[189:59.69]The price of candy has increased.
[190:04.10]The price of candy?
[190:05.98]Do I have candy?
[190:10.12]Oh, that was a newsflash.
[190:11.26]Important events are reported for everyone in the city.
[190:13.90]It's the Twix Brothers.
[190:18.62]Their stunt was a success!
[190:19.98]Alright, uh, that one was a sudden jump in candy prices.
[190:27.84]If you're buying or selling candy, pay close attention.
[190:33.31]Sudden scarcity has driven the price of candy up.
[190:36.11]In general, that means that prices will roughly double.
[190:39.79]Because, like, all the Twix guys did the stunt.
[190:43.75]Yeah, and the guy with the magic wand, I'm telling you!
[190:49.26]He deleted all their capes.
[190:57.67]Finally, my plan.
[190:59.97]Candy that sold for 300 may now sell for 600.
[191:02.17]I'll buy all the candy in the city and keep it for myself.
[191:09.92]Maybe I'll share or sell a little, but it is candy.
[191:14.54]Ahem.
[191:14.98]No, prices will stabilize after some time.
[191:18.00]Nobody can say for how long.
[191:20.20]For once, however, you have hit upon a good point.
[191:22.94]While it can be hard to predict price fluctuations if you keep a fairly wide variety of stock handy, it's possible to take advantage of a situation like this and make money.
[191:33.39]You can also try to take advantage of the situation after news comes in, of course, but it's harder to really make a profit that way.
[191:41.26]It's complicated.
[191:41.96]I'm hungry.
[191:44.44]It's really not that hard of a concept to understand.
[191:51.30]Ah, the news again.
[191:52.82]Watch carefully.
[191:53.34]This information could be vital.
[191:57.04]Louie the swordsman bounced check at local cafe.
[192:01.16]Now on the lam.
[192:07.75]Louie doesn't have any money.
[192:08.59]That's vital news.
[192:22.55]Imagine if you turned on the news and they just talked about how some random person couldn't pay for something.
[192:32.11]I'll tell you though, if that's your news, things are probably going pretty well wherever you are.
[192:44.50]Free Louie.
[192:47.10]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[192:47.76]Come here, talk to me.
[192:51.14]Store atmosphere.
[192:52.00]Uh-oh.
[192:53.82]We're getting a little bit more further to the left side here.
[193:00.64]Merchant level.
[193:02.48]I can get more items at level four.
[193:05.78]Level five is... What was it?
[193:08.99]Come here.
[193:11.63]Fusion rank one.
[193:13.53]At this level you may fuse items.
[193:17.11]What?
[193:22.67]Do I have any candy?
[193:23.27]No.
[193:25.59]No candy here.
[193:26.37]Nah, put the watermelon up there.
[193:30.66]Should I just stockpile cherries?
[193:34.42]Alright, somebody's gonna buy this fucking $5,000 statue.
[193:40.44]Put it up there instead of the steel sword.
[193:41.70]Alright, let's go.
[193:53.72]Bread?
[193:54.12]Oh, I came here to sell this.
[193:58.44]Did he say sell or buy?
[193:59.50]Yeah, what should I pay?
[194:02.10]Okay.
[194:07.86]I don't want the bread.
[194:08.88]Is there like a decline?
[194:10.28]Ooh.
[194:11.84]2,900. 2,600.
[194:24.34]Somebody take that statue.
[194:30.07]Looking for something?
[194:31.21]Do you have some food?
[194:35.83]I do.
[194:36.97]I have... Well, you're kind of a pain in the ass to sell to, though.
[194:41.77]Cherry.
[194:42.05]Thousand.
[194:42.27]Yeah, see?
[194:43.11]I told you.
[194:44.19]Unbelievable.
[194:53.77]Unbelievable.
[194:54.57]Uh, Louie... Uh... Louie, you don't have any money.
[195:16.26]It is Louie, though.
[195:17.13]Should I help Louie out?
[195:18.01]Alright, Louie, I'm gonna help you out here.
[195:27.31]Louie's my dungeon guy.
[195:28.41]I have to take care of the dungeon guy.
[195:29.77]Alright, I need to go... Speaking of dungeon, I need to do it now.
[195:42.33]I think... I'm just gonna give him the sword if he's too stupid to try to get it from me.
[195:48.14]You're aiding a known criminal.
[195:56.82]Pick the items you wish to bring with you.
[196:04.21]Can I just take the sword?
[196:10.54]Will he equip it?
[196:17.84]How do I equip this?
[196:27.21]He'll just do it?
[196:27.87]Okay.
[196:29.03]Alright, Louie.
[196:29.58]Let's go.
[196:31.36]Jade Way.
[196:31.92]We gotta go down.
[196:37.60]Floor 6 to 10.
[196:45.11]So you got it on, right?
[196:49.87]Yeah.
[196:51.19]He's got the... Alright.
[196:51.81]That was $3,000, Louie.
[196:52.27]You better put it to good use.
[196:58.53]And can you learn something else besides regular swing?
[197:01.68]This thing actually does a shitload of damage.
[197:11.85]Don't fuck this up, Louie.
[197:35.70]I need treasure, Louie.
[197:37.50]Find it.
[197:40.76]No, I don't want that.
[197:41.38]Mushrooms suck.
[197:45.72]I've gotten to the point in... Ow.
[197:47.74]I've gotten to the point in Diablo II where I don't even pick up any blues or gray or white.
[197:53.88]I don't pick any of those up anymore.
[197:55.51]If it's not yellow letters on the ground, I'm just going to run over it.
[198:07.60]Wow, I was just not paying attention.
[198:16.68]These little rabbits are so annoying.
[198:17.97]Just put them up against the wall.
[198:22.93]Come on.
[198:25.81]Next slide, please.
[198:27.03]Oh, we'll drop in frame.
[198:28.49]Whoa, whoa, who's that?
[198:30.35]Who's this?
[198:30.65]This person's human.
[198:35.22]Hmm?
[198:44.11]Hello?
[198:47.56]Oh, yes.
[198:48.46]Can I help you?
[198:50.02]I think that might be my line.
[198:52.28]Are you looking for something?
[198:54.20]I'd be happy to help if you are.
[198:59.76]I'm lost.
[199:01.14]Can you perhaps tell me where I am?
[199:03.83]Let's give her wrong directions.
[199:07.11]Where you are?
[199:07.77]Uh, and here that could be a problem.
[199:10.45]These dungeons alter their shape when a person enters.
[199:14.06]I'm afraid that giving you your precise current location is not possible.
[199:19.46]Oh, I've entered a dungeon then.
[199:21.30]How surprising.
[199:25.37]What?
[199:26.19]How can you... I was just on my way home from...
[199:32.36]Well... Bye.
[199:32.84]What should I do now, though?
[199:35.22]To begin with, I would recommend searching for a floor of the dungeon.
[199:58.99]With a large red door that will allow you to exit the dungeon.
[200:04.75]Really?
[200:05.07]Why, thank you, Miss Fairy.
[200:06.55]You are very kind.
[200:09.13]Be careful.
[200:10.65]Farewell.
[200:15.30]Well, that was unexpected.
[200:16.04]I hope she gets home okay.
[200:21.04]She's gone.
[200:28.44]But what did you leave back here?
[200:29.50]Did you even open this up?
[200:32.66]A rotten carrot.
[200:35.43]Oh, a shell necklace.
[200:39.15]Is it a ghost?
[200:39.93]I don't think it's... Is it a ghost?
[200:52.04]Whatever, I don't need it.
[200:52.72]I got thrown rocks.
[201:00.19]No, it's a bomb.
[201:09.92]Come on, Louie.
[201:10.82]What's that?
[201:11.20]Unidentified.
[201:12.02]Cool.
[201:22.14]One chain.
[201:23.24]What's that mean?
[201:25.14]What's that mean?
[201:31.53]Didn't get hit once.
[201:38.04]So, floor 10, I think is where we're gonna end up, right?
[201:40.86]A lot of damage.
[201:46.60]Please.
[201:48.22]Another necklace?
[201:53.41]Ooh.
[201:54.09]Ah, don't want it.
[201:55.79]I don't care about the Play-Doh looking thing.
[202:01.30]Still alive?
[202:09.17]What is it?
[202:09.53]Oh, another bomb.
[202:10.41]Will they get hurt by that?
[202:11.13]The blast radius?
[202:14.19]No, of course not.
[202:15.05]What's that?
[202:19.16]Is that a lizard on a stick?
[202:20.48]Charred lizard!
[202:31.56]This is fluffy.
[202:34.82]I got room for it.
[202:41.22]Ow.
[202:45.36]Eat lizard, eat lizard.
[202:46.68]I'll eat the lizard if I need to.
[202:48.02]I don't need to do it now.
[202:50.51]The bees drop good shit.
[202:56.11]New skill.
[203:01.61]Uh... What the fuck just happened?
[203:08.95]Did Twitch... Was it Twitch?
[203:12.44]That was weird.
[203:15.30]Did Twitch just go down?
[203:16.32]Because I was still in the chatroom.
[203:20.46]My internet wasn't, like, out.
[203:21.60]That was weird.
[203:25.00]Because I was still seeing everybody in the chat.
[203:32.26]Well, um... Welcome back to... Hey, welcome to a new stream!
[203:38.51]Did anybody else turn off?
[203:42.12]Did any other, like, other streamers turn off?
[203:51.65]No, just us?
[203:52.17]Oh.
[203:56.24]well don't ask me what the hell that was because everything was it was fine there was there was like no problems at all some other people did too well
[204:28.41]If we're good, we're good, right?
[204:29.71]What is that?
[204:34.94]Egg toast?
[204:36.66]I... I'm not even kidding around.
[204:38.80]That's one of my favorite breakfasts in the world.
[204:40.26]I'm not going to sell that.
[204:48.02]I'm going to keep that for later.
[204:52.65]Dentist bib.
[204:55.46]French toast is better.
[204:57.02]Don't.
[204:57.28]You're going to make me actually upset.
[205:03.50]French toast is not better than dropped egg on top.
[205:07.23]It's not.
[205:13.59]It is.
[205:13.99]Oh my god, it's not.
[205:17.59]It's not at all.
[205:18.35]It is so much worse than that.
[205:21.94]I don't know why everybody wants to make... What's with the sweetness stuff in breakfast?
[205:25.78]Cereal, I understand.
[205:26.66]I don't want, like, the sweetness.
[205:28.91]No.
[205:29.51]I want, like, savory.
[205:31.07]Bacon.
[205:32.33]Crunchy.
[205:33.59]Salty.
[205:35.83]Dipping your bread in soggy... Soaking it up with eggs and then frying it on the skillet and adding a bunch of powdered sugar and syrup on it.
[205:44.15]I'm not a fan.
[205:52.98]I'm going to get hit by every single one of these rocks.
[205:57.12]No, I'm kidding.
[206:01.62]French toast is actually really good.
[206:02.70]French toast is really good if it's made with enough backtracking.
[206:11.50]You know, if French toast is made with enough unpopular opinions to then backtrack well, then I would think that would be worth it.
[206:28.35]I'm getting a lot of, um... I'm getting a lot of random items, isn't it?
[206:36.65]Good, he's level 11.
[206:43.64]Backpedaling.
[206:44.54]Backtracking.
[206:45.32]What did I say?
[206:46.48]Backtracking?
[206:48.58]Close enough.
[207:01.36]Come here!
[207:01.84]You stupid gopher!
[207:09.61]That felt good.
[207:12.41]Eat lizard.
[207:13.01]No!
[207:14.49]What?
[207:14.63]Did I just teleport down?
[207:16.11]Where did I go?
[207:24.73]I want to see what the boss is.
[207:25.61]I'm looking forward to the boss.
[207:28.33]Don't pick up slimes.
[207:30.47]They're not even worth picking up.
[207:36.52]Ooh, what's that?
[207:38.74]I wonder how many floors are down here.
[207:41.96]I missed a shark fin.
[207:49.97]Oh shit, did I?
[207:51.75]I'll get it, I'll get it, don't worry.
[207:56.23]Got it.
[207:58.15]Where was it?
[207:58.47]Up here?
[207:59.45]I can wrap around.
[208:05.15]What is it?
[208:05.41]Over here?
[208:07.10]Over here is over here?
[208:15.56]One frame.
[208:16.22]Are we getting oofed?
[208:17.76]I don't know.
[208:19.59]That's weird.
[208:21.85]There's the shark fin.
[208:22.93]Hey, I'll take it.
[208:28.29]The screen's frozen, but I can hear him.
[208:32.19]Hello?
[208:43.10]Usually I can tell him when it's a cocks problem, because all my internet will get fucked up.
[208:49.72]I'll look over and chat won't even be working.
[208:53.34]So maybe this is like a Twitch ingest server problem?
[208:56.46]I don't know.
[208:59.52]If it is, it is.
[209:00.14]If it isn't, it isn't.
[209:01.32]Floor 10.
[209:01.50]Time for a boss.
[209:11.63]Twitch is having indigestion.
[209:13.09]Yeah.
[209:14.45]It's a giant rat with a crowbar.
[209:21.37]Okay, I gotta be careful because it looks like he... This is such an awesome created character.
[209:27.53]I feel like this is a wrestling character.
[209:29.09]Ooh, that hurt.
[209:32.77]I'm gonna have to eat the lizard soon.
[209:38.61]Holy shit, he's... What is he doing?
[209:43.09]What did he just do?
[209:43.59]Is he... What did he do?
[209:44.30]Did he just eat something?
[209:45.34]What the fuck?
[209:46.72]Why did he just fall?
[209:47.82]Oh, he's eating the mushrooms and falling down.
[209:53.16]Don't let him eat the red ones.
[209:54.05]That's probably health.
[209:57.41]Right?
[209:58.51]If I were a video game, the purple ones would be the poisonous ones.
[210:08.12]Let's see if that theory is correct.
[210:11.76]Nah, he's crit.
[210:12.78]Double crit!
[210:14.46]Triple crit!
[210:16.88]That's pretty damn good.
[210:24.11]Not dead?
[210:26.33]Oh no, that was his last breath.
[210:28.15]He sat up to fall back down.
[210:32.31]Alright, what did I take?
[210:35.65]Anything even worth taking here?
[210:39.69]Ingredient.
[210:42.29]I got some unidentified stuff.
[210:44.27]Some fins.
[210:46.17]Let's go.
[210:49.09]Let's see what we got.
[210:54.95]Charred lizard, fur ball, insect trap, chocolate bar, egg toast.
[211:01.11]Shark fin.
[211:02.41]So what the hell was it?
[211:04.40]Was it a bunch of insect traps?
[211:09.34]Furball, cha- what was it?
[211:11.96]Slime?
[211:17.08]Raincoat?
[211:17.62]These items are terrible.
[211:24.63]Looks like nobody's here.
[211:28.55]That bar is really not very good then, is it?
[211:30.47]Alright, time for bed.
[211:42.70]Holy shit, they were like 20 subs.
[211:46.37]Men of character are currently seeking out rusty daggers.
[211:49.81]Help conserve water.
[211:50.99]Turn that faucet off when brushing your teeth.
[211:54.93]Rusty dagger.
[211:57.74]I can get a rusty dagger?
[212:01.62]Buy.
[212:03.14]Rusty dagger.
[212:04.00]How much is it?
[212:07.64]Should I buy, like, a few of them?
[212:08.42]Alright.
[212:17.18]Fusion.
[212:19.68]The product of this fusion will be a mystery until you attempt it.
[212:25.60]So, rank fusion result.
[212:27.27]Rank 1 dagger.
[212:29.81]Rank 1 staff.
[212:33.01]Magician's staff?
[212:34.71]Easy.
[212:42.49]What?
[212:46.79]Rank one bracelet.
[212:52.11]Five insect traps.
[212:55.56]Rank one necklace.
[212:56.64]Should I go for it?
[213:01.58]It takes a lizard and a shell.
[213:04.94]I'm gonna do it.
[213:11.78]Ooh!
[213:16.12]A necklace with a magical blue stone.
[213:17.94]Who knows what a stone this could do for you.
[213:20.88]$10,400.
[213:21.34]Holy shit.
[213:30.62]Cyanide0 gave 20 community subs.
[213:35.22]Thank you so much for the huge amount of subs.
[213:38.94]That is a shitload.
[213:43.42]Hold on.
[213:45.20]Longsword and I don't have all the ingredients for these.
[213:49.87]What do I know how to do?
[213:52.41]Insect trap and iron armband is the one that I can do.
[213:55.27]And it's for a bracelet.
[213:57.03]I need five insect traps and an armband.
[214:03.45]Let's get it.
[214:04.05]Five insect traps.
[214:05.69]You got those here?
[214:08.52]You got iron armbands here.
[214:09.72]I know you do.
[214:10.58]Don't you?
[214:11.72]Yes, you do.
[214:12.38]How many do you got?
[214:17.06]Let's just get one.
[214:18.32]And then I have to go to the market.
[214:25.57]Food, medicines, flooring?
[214:28.73]Wallpaper?
[214:30.03]Carpets?
[214:30.55]What the fuck is all this?
[214:36.52]Should I get more daggers?
[214:41.16]This is stupid!
[214:42.70]I'll get five more.
[214:50.19]Should I sell this thing for like 15,000?
[214:51.97]Holy shit.
[214:53.21]I can sell this thing for like 20,000.
[214:55.17]Get that.
[214:56.55]No, get it in the window.

[215:58.79]Let's hope that's what he wants.
[216:01.61]I'd like a rusty dagger, please.
[216:12.52]I want food.
[216:13.18]Take candy instead.
[216:15.64]Somebody buy that necklace.
[216:21.05]I don't even want you to have this, because...
[216:27.09]I have to use that.
[216:29.35]I don't want to use a rusty dagger.
[216:35.99]Why is he even buying this?
[216:42.25]Somebody buy... Somebody buy the necklace.
[216:47.39]Put a raincoat up there?
[216:51.62]No.
[216:54.30]Put that necklace up there too.
[216:58.16]Why would I put the cheaper necklace next to the more expensive necklace?
[217:10.98]Is it really that expensive?
[217:15.53]Madness!
[217:16.13]Are you sure?
[217:17.37]Alright, 130.

[219:23.51]Are you not even trying to make money?
[219:26.13]Yes, I am!
[219:26.79]What do you mean I'm not even trying?
[219:35.50]He's- I'm gonna make it to the end of the week?
[219:37.22]Hey!
[219:41.64]The price of shields has decreased!
[219:44.30]Today's saucepan index, 20.

[220:35.87]Hmm.
[220:37.87]Yes.
[220:40.67]No!
[220:44.15]Something's wrong with Louie.
[220:46.77]I think Louie may have gotten hit in the head too hard down in the dungeon.
[220:52.47]Let's go ask.
[220:54.53]Why do I get the feeling that I would much rather not get involved?
[221:02.13]Louie, hello?
[221:04.80]Oh, receipt.
[221:07.26]Receipt.
[221:11.84]Like a store receipt.
[221:20.21]Right, okay.
[221:23.15]Oh, receipt.
[221:24.77]Tier, what's up?
[221:28.13]What are you doing wandering around here?
[221:30.66]Oh, well, I got hungry, so I decided to take a look and see if I could find some edible grasses or herbs or something.
[221:35.80]You're eating grass?
[221:38.64]I don't have any money or anything, and I keep bouncing checks, so I read on the internet that you could eat grass and it was a superfood.
[221:50.79]I'm not so sure which of these are edible, you see.
[221:53.85]Louie, if you eat that, you'll blow up your stomach.
[222:05.08]uh that's that's funny it is they taste best if you clean them now the plants with the soft leaves at the east end of the plaza those taste the best you should try them I eat grass too why do you know so much about this thanks a ton receipt I owe you again no problem remember to wash what you find why do I feel as though that is the least of his concerns
[222:41.79]No, not yet.

[229:13.90]No one's buying this.
[229:14.80]People buy the shark fins.
[229:19.06]No one's buying the necklace either.
[229:22.31]Let's go.
[229:31.99]And of course, you're selling this when I'm broke.
[229:34.88]You can't afford this, Eloise.
[229:36.14]So stop coming in here.
[229:40.80]That's alright.

[232:48.03]It's beef time.
[232:48.97]Yeah, I got good food here.
[232:51.14]Change walls.
[232:54.32]Thin layers of lacquer painted atop one another for a smooth finish.
[232:58.26]The beauty's in the color blending.
[233:03.80]Did I do it?
[233:05.00]That's what I currently own.
[233:10.04]Let's go.
[233:11.98]Get rid of the shield inventory.
[233:15.84]You still want a bracelet?
[233:18.26]I don't have any bracelets.
[233:19.84]You come in every day.
[233:25.36]I'd like a hat.
[233:26.14]I don't have hats either.
[233:42.25]I thought you didn't have any money.
[233:49.31]Invest in hats and bracelets.
[233:51.83]Ooh, we're getting rid of our last cape.
[233:53.39]2,500.
[233:53.89]Finally.
[233:59.16]Took a few months, but I got rid of all capes.
[234:05.36]I got some left over here.
[234:07.18]Do you have a book?
[234:08.56]It's an errand.
[234:11.60]I do have a book.
[234:13.10]I'll take that.
[234:13.70]700 bucks.
[234:14.00]She's not gonna do it.
[234:16.53]Do you have a book?
[234:18.01]Yeah, we have one.
[234:20.35]Um...
[234:35.82]Just give her the book.
[234:53.63]Two days.
[234:57.17]Give me a bracelet.
[234:59.69]Merchant's Guild.
[235:00.67]Bracelet.
[235:03.13]Although they're like, look at how cheap these swords are.
[235:14.98]Look at how cheap all this is.
[235:21.61]How much do I have left?
[235:23.93]Not enough.
[235:24.65]I have enough for Sturdy Glove.
[235:25.59]Alright, Bracelet.
[235:35.60]Okay, stop.
[235:48.79]A hat!
[235:49.09]I need a hat.
[235:49.49]Well, I need to pay $30,000 in two days.
[236:11.07]The price of heavy armor has decreased.
[236:13.35]Oh, don't keep doing this.
[236:14.69]The price of swords has normalized.
[236:16.34]I told you I should have done what I did.
[236:18.56]I told you.
[236:19.16]Wait, what?
[236:19.46]Oh, because all weapons prices are down.
[236:27.06]Still worth it.
[236:27.52]It's still worth it.
[236:41.82]I'm not going to sell it.
[236:45.33]Alright, I got what everybody needs.
[236:46.51]Let's go.
[236:46.91]Let's get a raincoat over here.
[237:00.41]Holy shit, you actually want this.
[237:02.67]You want the thankful statue.
[237:04.37]Let's try to get six grand for this.
[237:16.06]Cut the loss into 5 grand?
[237:20.50]I think 5,000.
[237:20.74]5,500?
[237:20.76]5,200 is probably safer.
[237:21.34]5,199.
[237:23.04]Yes!
[237:41.76]That was a big... That was a big one.
[237:43.68]Ooh.
[237:46.98]This month is tight, but I really want that shield.
[237:49.10]You have a better shield.
[237:52.08]What's he doing with all this stuff?
[238:03.68]I guess if you're gonna pay me for it, then I'll take it.
[238:05.71]Fine.
[238:11.67]You have one of these?
[238:12.29]It's a lucky day for both of us.
[238:13.59]Egg toast.
[238:14.03]It's gonna take a lot for me to part with the egg toast.
[238:18.63]You're killing me!
[238:27.38]Got it.
[238:42.12]Everybody wants the egg toast.
[238:43.26]It's good shit.
[238:45.80]Cherries sell very easily at 1200.
[238:46.58]Alright.
[238:48.70]Time for bed.
[238:49.12]13600 is a pretty good profit.
[239:12.86]Now, let's get to work.
[239:14.01]Let's do our best today!
[239:14.91]What should I put?
[239:15.73]What should I put?
[239:16.43]What should I put?
[239:42.43]Anything else I need up here?
[239:43.43]I'm gonna keep one of these.
[239:44.51]Sturdy Glove.
[239:49.18]Not bad.
[239:51.30]I could buy food, but when's Judgment Day tomorrow?
[239:58.45]Improve the store?
[239:59.25]Yeah, I'm gonna go buy cooler stuff.
[240:02.07]Alright.
[240:03.69]Sturdy Glove.
[240:06.19]Now he's got a better glove.
[240:14.72]Thanos.
[240:16.60]How much is that dagger?
[240:18.86]500.
[240:21.32]What do you need?
[240:26.00]You have a bracelet.
[240:27.73]I do have a bracelet.
[240:29.49]It's spiked armband.
[240:32.81]You can backhand somebody with this thing.
[240:35.71]That'll be 1,300.
[240:36.13]Ooh, that'll be... Uh-oh.
[240:37.13]1,200.
[240:37.41]Uh-oh.
[240:55.38]Armor has increased.
[240:56.74]The value of things boom has ended.
[241:00.96]Armor.
[241:01.26]Do I have armor?
[241:05.79]Price.
[241:06.29]Oh, robes.
[241:08.87]I don't care about that little girl anymore.
[241:10.75]Ooh, armor.
[241:11.95]This is all.
[241:12.53]This is armor.
[241:18.58]Alright, I'm gonna go buy just the shittiest bracelet I can find.
[241:28.79]Give me a bracelet.
[241:30.73]Am I actually gonna go to the store and buy a more expensive bracelet to buy?
[241:35.99]Why would I do that?
[241:37.14]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[241:43.86]Big sis, wait.
[241:47.07]You walk so fast.
[241:52.03]Hmm.
[241:56.31]Tyr, is something wrong?
[241:58.90]Oh, no, it's nothing.
[241:59.56]You're looking at those sisters.
[242:03.16]Hey, Tyr, how do you think people see us?
[242:06.78]How do?
[242:08.50]Do you think we look like sisters?
[242:10.94]Given that I'm a fairy, I rather doubt that.
[242:13.54]Oh, right.
[242:14.18]Still, if we did, I'd be kinda happy.
[242:18.15]Well, since I'm bigger, I'd be the big sister, right?
[242:21.46]Your logic, as always, is breathtaking.
[242:23.86]Yeah, I guess you would be the big sister.
[242:26.16]That'd be really nice, too.
[242:27.54]Right, sis?
[242:32.72]I'm gonna sell my shares in this company.
[242:35.54]I think I'm out of here.
[242:41.90]You're breathtaking!
[242:43.66]Hey, wait for me!
[242:47.74]What's going on in the market?
[242:52.04]Konnichiwa!
[242:52.78]Oh, hi!
[242:53.14]How are you out shopping?
[242:55.63]Oh, hello!
[242:56.01]Yes, I was just looking for some ingredients for lunch.
[242:58.33]There's such a selection, though.
[242:59.61]I can't make up my mind.
[243:02.07]It's kind of amazing, isn't it?
[243:03.47]You can turn one thing into a lot of dishes.
[243:05.89]Or a lot of things into one dish.
[243:07.67]It's sort of like magic, the way cooking changes stuff.
[243:11.25]I never thought about that way.
[243:12.47]You're adorable.
[243:14.73]Hmm, speaking of culinary magic, have you ever heard of the legendary chef?
[243:20.31]Legendary whozit?
[243:22.47]Apparently there is a chef who takes the worst ingredients and turns them into food that can delight anyone.
[243:28.45]You know, things like slime liver salad, skeleton bones, souffle, jello, volcano, crab, cakes, things like that.
[243:37.69]That's amazing, I guess.
[243:39.19]I have to wonder if it's actually edible, though.
[243:42.94]I don't know.
[243:46.08]Food is cheap, right?
[243:51.62]Is the great candy price increase of... Look at this.
[243:58.50]This is cheap shit right now.
[244:00.41]Watermelons.
[244:02.63]This is so cheap.

[252:22.78]That's true.
[252:25.90]Do I really have no talent?
[252:27.24]No, you have plenty of talent.
[252:28.30]Don't say that.
[252:31.79]Candy apple.
[252:38.71]Those things... I don't think I've ever put an offer in for a candy apple and people haven't taken it.
[252:48.80]I thought that was the tile.
[252:49.74]It's like, why?
[252:50.88]That's not even for sale.

[253:48.46]What was that?
[253:48.90]That was like a backhanded insult.
[253:54.08]I feel like this guy's... Think I can get away with it?
[254:02.93]Hmm.
[254:19.89]Yes.
[254:24.17]Daggers has decreased.

[255:07.75]150%.

[255:26.14]I found a ham sandwich out in the trash, is where you found this.
[255:32.17]I found a ham sandwich.

[255:36.95]This is expensive.
[255:40.58]A thousand.
[255:43.02]Come on, I kind of want the sandwich.
[255:44.76]Fifteen hundred.

[256:22.54]I want this shield.
[256:25.54]1600.
[256:26.48]A little lower.
[256:27.21]You're right.
[256:27.83]I could do 145.
[256:28.21]50.
[256:28.27]One more?
[256:28.81]This is nice.
[256:29.39]Yes, it is.
[256:31.93]Bless.
[256:32.39]I can't back... You know what?
[256:37.23]I got it for so cheap. 2400.
[256:52.81]Almost level 7.
[256:53.67]Come on.
[256:54.79]Level 7.
[256:55.07]I did it.
[256:55.33]Anybody else?
[257:00.51]Candy apple.
[257:06.41]That's too... Apparently that's way too expensive.
[257:08.14]We'll do... $19.99.
[257:10.06]Hello.
[257:21.46]This is something my grandmother treasured.
[257:23.20]This guy with the same yam.
[257:35.29]I do keep getting yammed.
[257:36.71]Nice.
[257:41.46]Why is everybody's grandma in the game so lame?
[257:50.60]That's a good question.
[257:51.96]I have to be careful here now, because over the course of the next week, this is probably going to be $60,000 to $70,000.
[258:08.81]This is the payment for the week.
[258:12.04]Congratulations, well done.
[258:13.22]I have officially received your payment for this week.
[258:15.34]Let us continue to work hard next week.
[258:19.36]I did it.
[258:25.00]Alright.
[258:26.44]50 grand, 60 grand, probably maybe 70 grand total.
[258:31.49]Alright, gonna work hard today too.
[258:32.89]Capitalism ho!
[258:33.87]Oh, what's that girl doing outside the shop?
[258:43.03]She's just kind of staring into the shop.
[258:44.89]And she has a... a tattoo on her head.
[258:53.75]Okay.
[258:54.13]Does she want to come inside, maybe?
[258:56.39]Or are windows that gripping?
[259:02.71]Well, smile, receipt!
[259:04.11]Come on, smile!
[259:04.89]Look friendly!
[259:05.60]I just imagined a forced teeth smile.
[259:11.86]Okay, what should I do here?
[259:14.34]Call the police.
[259:15.50]Please tell me you have not reached the point where your face is frozen in a vapid smile for all eternity.
[259:20.23]Meow!
[259:21.87]There's a girl at the window who looked curious about the inside and she's looking, scanning the items.
[259:26.76]Yeah, we got a neighborhood watch down here.
[259:34.80]I'll just come and arrest you.
[259:36.84]The shop, so I try to give her my best come in and buy lots of stuff smile.
[259:42.15]She's not there anymore.
[259:45.21]Citizens arrest.
[260:00.35]So I am terrifying, you say.
[260:02.19]Really terrifying.
[260:05.99]Is that smile you think?
[260:07.01]Yeah, you're a terror.
[260:10.11]Can we just stop staring at each other?
[260:24.13]What did I do wrong now?
[260:28.75]Given how well you're doing, I think it's time I explained how to take an order in advance.
[260:35.99]Customers have simply put purchasing items from us immediately with an advance order.
[260:40.04]However, a customer will let us know what they want and return in a set number of days to pick up the items.
[260:49.34]Obviously not every customer will want to do this, but if a customer tells you that they want something in 70 days, it's an advance order.
[260:55.47]Okay, so I have to make sure I have it here.
[261:00.94]It's pre-orders.
[261:08.20]If they simply wanted the items now, they would purchase the items now.
[261:10.84]The date is based on what is convenient for the customer, not you.
[261:15.00]So if they want an item in say three days, you must give it to them then.
[261:18.22]And remember, we must be open to actually sell an item to someone.
[261:23.68]So make sure the store is open that day or we cannot fill the order.
[261:28.42]Okay.
[261:31.55]It's too complex.
[261:32.61]No, I get it.
[261:33.27]I understand how this works.
[261:35.02]People use advanced orders to purchase multiple items at once.
[261:37.46]It is an excellent chance to sell many items in one go.
[261:40.72]Try to fill as many as you can.
[261:44.56]See, she said it was complicated.
[261:46.46]I said it was fun.
[261:53.75]Alright, let's go.
[261:54.35]Who should I choose?
[262:02.48]Let's get rid of this.
[262:03.04]Actually, no, I'm gonna hold on to the food.
[262:04.34]There's gonna be a food surge.
[262:07.91]I just know it.
[262:08.75]Somebody will buy this fucking dumb necklace eventually.
[262:11.79]Get it in the window.
[262:12.77]Hmm.
[262:12.95]So how much do I owe?
[262:13.81]80,000 next week.
[262:17.35]I knew it was gonna be hovering around there somewhere.
[262:37.97]That's a lot.
[262:39.77]That is a lot.
[262:40.73]Okay, I think I'm gonna go adventure.
[262:46.13]I think it's time to go down.
[263:01.30]Steel sword.
[263:04.62]Anything else I can take here?
[263:08.68]I could take some, just the bread, just in case I need to eat it.
[263:17.17]That's good.
[263:19.43]So now we're going to go to floor 11 to 15.
[263:26.66]So what's other... Equip items, yes.
[263:28.30]Here we go.
[263:32.62]So I'm looking for the Play-Doh snake things.
[263:38.66]I need like five of those Play-Doh, green Play-Doh snake thingies.
[263:56.70]What?
[263:58.70]Alright, I just noticed somebody linked the total and immediately a bunch of manipulators just did it.
[264:06.17]I didn't even do anything.
[264:08.37]See that manipulation in real time?
[264:10.53]That's market manipulation.
[264:11.99]You motherfuckers can go into jail for that.
[264:31.09]This game's pretty fun.
[264:33.63]I like this game.
[264:45.38]Do I get to have anybody else besides Louie?
[264:46.96]Tell me if I miss any items.
[265:00.69]No, go back around this way.
[265:03.39]Ow.
[265:05.71]I mean, I guess, you know, I could just go down as fast as I possibly can.
[265:12.72]To try boots.
[265:14.68]Leather boots.
[265:18.22]Oh, don't be so stupid here.
[265:31.17]Okay, I thought that was an NPC.
[265:42.27]Oops.
[265:45.60]Can I block?
[265:46.56]Is there a way to hold the shield up?
[265:49.62]I guess not.
[265:52.72]You have to parry.
[266:02.09]Well, that would be shocking.
[266:04.83]Oh, you auto-block from the front.
[266:06.31]Okay.
[266:06.87]That's good to know.
[266:19.36]Stupid rocks.
[266:29.17]Kind of an odd random encounter.
[266:36.40]Yeah, that was... Actually, you're right.
[266:37.96]That was a sharp nado.
[266:39.10]Alright, don't get sloppy here, because I don't have a way to heal.
[266:45.78]I have to level up to heal, or eat the bread.
[266:48.82]And I brought one bread.
[266:50.90]Alright, I'm gonna have to eat it.
[267:03.56]No, I think I can probably level up before that.
[267:12.55]More bread.
[267:16.23]Really?
[267:20.59]No Play-Doh snake things.
[267:27.98]Can I buy those from anybody?
[267:41.66]Oh, shit.
[267:47.98]Fish wheel.
[267:48.90]It's not fish wheel.
[267:57.00]What?
[267:57.20]Is everything that I get hit by or die to have to be a wheel?
[268:15.57]Yes.
[268:16.67]Yes, yes, yes.
[268:20.55]Mushroom wheel.
[268:27.19]Whatever you say.
[268:28.67]I'll take all your words for it.
[268:39.28]Capitalist wheel.
[268:42.77]Something good.
[268:44.67]No.
[268:48.74]That shit sucks.
[268:51.28]I think I'm just gonna throw those in the trash.
[268:53.54]I'm just gonna sell them.
[268:57.12]And merchant.
[268:57.88]Not even on my store.
[268:59.12]This stuff's not even worth picking up.
[269:09.22]Ooh.
[269:10.80]Windbreaker.
[269:15.09]No, I don't want to pick that up.
[269:16.73]I don't want to pick up the shitty toupee.
[269:22.11]Damn it.
[269:23.37]Damn it.
[269:23.97]Alright.
[269:24.43]Candy.
[269:25.47]I'll take it.
[269:47.41]Alright, I got hit by Fishwheel, but he died to Fishwheel.
[269:53.49]Make fun of him instead.
[270:05.86]Mom's making cookies from Baskin... Yeah, it's the best ice cream I've ever had.
[270:11.24]Mom's making cookies from Baskin Robbins is the best thing I've ever eaten in my whole life.
[270:29.25]That tweet kept me up all night.
[270:31.53]Why?
[270:33.85]Because my one real tweet in three or four months is a shitpost?
[270:46.78]It kept me up at night.
[270:56.04]Explain it.
[270:57.22]What's there to explain?
[270:58.12]There's nothing to... I don't have to explain anything.
[271:12.89]Just know that the ice cream
[271:16.93]Moms Making Cookies from Baskin Robbins, this is all you need to know, is without question the best ice cream I have ever had in my life.
[271:32.59]I couldn't stop that one.
[271:33.87]I tried.
[271:43.47]I couldn't.
[271:44.07]There it is.
[271:46.58]I tried to put my hand up to mute, but I couldn't.
[271:49.54]Excuse me for that.
[271:50.58]Did I miss something up here?
[271:58.75]Greedy goblin streamer sells out to ice cream company.
[272:03.65]Eat mom's making cookies ice cream.
[272:05.95]Find a Baskin Robbins and go eat there.
[272:07.89]Eat.
[272:09.51]Go have the Mom's Making Cookies ice cream.
[272:12.03]And come back.
[272:13.41]And talk to me.
[272:16.27]Tell me that I was wrong.
[272:17.79]I want you to.
[272:19.07]I want you to prove me wrong.
[272:20.37]I want you to go there, I want you to have it, and then I want you to tell me that I was wrong.
[272:24.07]I'm ready to debate you.
[272:26.18]I'm ready to hear it.
[272:31.56]It's... I'm just telling...
[272:45.94]I got destroyed in this debate?
[272:47.72]We haven't even started debating!
[272:50.87]I haven't debated anybody on this.
[272:59.59]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[273:01.52]This is a tricky pull here.
[273:19.86]There's one other ice cream that I think I've ever had that reaction to.
[273:24.12]And I don't agree with it anymore.
[273:26.17]My opinion has changed.
[273:29.19]The birthday cake ice cream from Cold Stone used to be... It was just... I couldn't handle it.
[273:35.95]It was too good.
[273:38.91]I need to get rid of some stuff.
[273:39.97]Hold on.
[273:46.62]But my tastes have changed.
[273:49.61]I don't believe that anymore.
[273:51.21]It's like too sweet.
[273:52.13]It's too much for me now.
[274:05.42]Lemon basil ice cream.
[274:06.44]That's also, that's very good too, but I wouldn't call that the best ice cream I've ever had in my life.
[274:12.72]I would call that a very substantially good ice cream.
[274:19.30]Alright, we're at 14.
[274:19.98]Almost at 15.
[274:20.26]Getting there.
[274:26.84]Can't carry anymore.
[274:27.56]It's not worth... Is it worth throwing something else away for the candy?
[274:34.39]Moose tracks?
[274:35.07]No, moose tracks doesn't have shit on moms making cookies.
[274:39.97]And I know, I know that that might be your favorite.
[274:42.09]Moose tracks might be your favorite, but that means you haven't had moms making cookies.
[274:46.55]That's what it means.
[274:47.97]That's alright.
[274:48.45]I know that's what happened.
[274:54.55]Half-baked used to be my favorite ice cream from Ben & Jerry's.
[274:59.61]I was so uninformed.
[275:08.32]Mom's Making Cookies is cookies inside of a cookie dough flavored ice cream with cookie dough chunks inside of it as well.
[275:15.73]It is a cookie dough flavored ice cream.
[275:19.01]Do you understand?
[275:20.58]You need to think about this.
[275:21.60]You have to understand this.
[275:33.31]I don't know how they did it.
[275:34.19]I don't know how they do it.
[275:35.45]I don't know what kind of, I don't know what kind of like flavor chemical they put into this.
[275:38.64]I don't know.
[275:40.96]But it's insanely good.
[275:42.84]So much so that I bought like the, I bought like the three pound tub of it.
[275:46.00]Yes, I did.
[275:49.35]I didn't just go there and have it.
[275:50.51]I went there and had it and freaked out and said I want to buy like the four pound tub.
[276:04.31]I can actually prove that.
[276:06.18]I bought, like, the tub.
[276:11.42]I'm not gonna... No!
[276:12.38]No more food shit!
[276:13.48]No, I'm not doing any more food streams!
[276:17.26]No, no, I'm not doing food.
[276:19.03]No food shit.
[276:26.47]Go back for the yam?
[276:27.37]Hold on.
[276:31.36]Can I just throw this away?
[276:40.65]I can't throw his stuff away.
[276:45.19]Throw this away.
[276:46.09]Eat the bread.
[276:55.46]Pick up the cherry.
[276:57.14]And pick up the yam.
[277:03.00]Get rid of that stupid windbreaker.
[277:09.77]What's wrong with the windbreaker?
[277:10.69]Don't they sell?
[277:16.39]Sell him a better sword.
[277:17.61]He won't buy a better sword.
[277:18.63]He keeps coming in and getting wristbands.
[277:21.55]Ooh, it's a helmet.
[277:24.05]It's wooden.
[277:24.43]We're almost 15 floors down and you're gonna give me a wooden helmet?
[277:28.32]Ow.
[277:37.40]No, I don't want the toupee.
[277:40.80]Mom's makin' cookies.
[277:43.84]The name sucks.
[277:46.15]If it was makin' cookies... Alright, you have me there.
[277:51.19]Mom's makin' cookies.
[277:53.33]With, you know, makin' cookies, not making.
[277:56.23]It's Mom's makin' cookies!
[277:59.59]No, just makin' cookies.
[278:00.71]Mom's makin' cookies.
[278:09.32]See, people see the name and they go, alright.
[278:12.98]That sounds like shit.
[278:14.64]That's a gimmick.
[278:27.60]Damn it, I was trying to go this way.
[278:29.92]I missed twice.
[278:36.68]Can I review it?
[278:37.47]I've already just- I just reviewed it!
[278:39.61]I just told you it's the best ice cream I've ever had, and I told you what was in it.
[278:43.33]What else is for me to review?
[278:50.60]Do it while eating it.
[278:51.38]I already know what it tastes like.
[278:55.36]Uh-oh.
[278:57.72]This is the lowest floor of the dungeon.
[279:00.99]Not precisely.
[279:01.73]While we cannot currently proceed any further, I strongly suspect that we can go even deeper next time.
[279:07.77]Am I getting hard locked out because I was doing too well?
[279:14.59]The dungeons change shape every time someone enters them.
[279:17.28]Some theorize that they adapt to the strength of those who enter.
[279:20.42]That is what happened.
[279:22.08]And refer to it as the Living Dungeon Phenomenon.
[279:24.16]Okay, so what's in the chest?
[279:28.48]I wonder if the dungeon gets bored if it's alone.
[279:33.93]So that would make the people who are foolish enough to enter a place like this the playthings of the underworld.
[279:40.05]I see.
[279:40.73]I like the way you think, girl.
[279:44.11]Who's there?
[279:46.23]It's me.
[279:46.71]No, it's... It's me.
[279:52.01]Evenin.
[279:52.37]Name's Charm.
[279:53.69]The lady thief.
[279:56.35]Th-th-th-thief?
[279:59.06]So, your treasure is valuables and assorted shiny bits.
[280:02.12]I'll be taking them if you please.
[280:05.22]We won't let you!
[280:08.32]Always the way.
[280:09.96]Well then, in that case, looks like it's time to cut some fools.
[280:14.79]Oh shit, this guy sucks!
[280:16.35]Why do we have to bring, like, the jobber?
[280:40.52]Easy!
[280:43.60]Can I eat?
[280:52.70]Oh yes, I can.
[280:56.35]Good thing I can S this.
[281:04.25]Ooh!

[281:09.47]Sweep the leg!
[281:23.09]And a crit to end it.
[281:26.22]What's that?
[281:27.48]There's a Heart Scarf right there.
[281:31.23]Oh friggin fraggin ow Yosemite Sam There are only two characters in the history of all media that have done friggin fraggin and that is Yosemite Sam and What's Earl from Home Alone?
[281:51.71]What's his name?

[282:02.01]Harry.
[282:02.59]That's right.
[282:03.11]Harry from Home Alone and Yosemite Sam are the only two people that are allowed to do that.
[282:10.71]Miss, are you okay?
[282:15.06]I'm mortally wounded.

[283:17.44]Really seems to me like you two make a good pair.
[283:22.18]Well then, young ladies, I should scamper since I've been beaten like a mutt.

[284:52.36]What's the cheapest thing I have here?
[284:54.28]It's either the raincoat... or I need the insect trap.
[284:59.32]Or the candy.
[285:00.54]Just eat the candy.
[285:06.24]Ooh, a pot.

[285:31.91]So we're going to do another go pee scenario.
[285:36.15]It's because I'm drinking soda.
[285:37.67]Speaking of Home Alone, I'm the kid in Home Alone that drinks the soda and pisses the bed.
[285:41.06]I'll be right back.
[287:29.38]Thank you.

[289:51.38]A lot of boots.
[289:52.50]Get those up there, too.
[289:53.38]Very... 21,000 dollars.
[289:54.00]Um...
[290:17.65]I got a lot of expensive stuff.
[290:24.13]I'm gonna dump all this other crap though.
[290:29.25]The bat wings are worth some money.
[290:32.81]How many insect traps do I need?
[290:34.12]I need five, right?
[290:41.56]Store atmosphere.
[290:42.38]Whoa!

[290:58.91]Subs coming in hot.
[291:01.53]I can't even touch them.

[291:03.29]They just came out of the oven.
[291:05.41]Thank you, Classy Banana.
[291:09.19]No orders, but thanks a lot.
[291:11.49]Appreciate it.

[291:59.76]Oh, it's her.
[292:01.12]Not bad.
[292:01.74]This is a pretty nice looking place.
[292:05.44]Oh, it's her.
[292:06.36]It's the lady.
[292:08.02]I forgot about you.
[292:10.40]You're not gonna steal shit, are you?
[292:13.23]You know, is it really so kosher for an employee to give a customer a face like that?
[292:17.21]Hmm, well it looks like she's got a different idea.
[292:34.57]Um, we're doing this in the middle of all the customers?
[292:37.39]Oh, yay!
[292:38.11]Charm, welcome.
[292:38.99]I'm so glad you came.
[292:40.07]Yeah, well, I kept wondering about this place.
[292:42.79]Nice store you have here.
[292:45.73]Thank you.
[292:46.23]Make yourself at home.
[292:49.59]Receipt.
[292:51.75]See?
[292:51.99]I see all too clearly.
[292:54.71]Thank you.
[292:57.31]That receipt's a good girl.
[292:58.87]Nice, trusting, honest.
[293:00.89]Don't you agree?
[293:03.45]Of course I do.
[293:04.33]You don't need to tell me that.
[293:06.99]Who gives a shit about any of this?
[293:09.17]Are you gonna buy something or not?
[293:11.19]You annoying motherfucker.
[293:16.26]I guess not.
[293:17.66]Thanks for wasting a full hour of my time.
[293:19.92]I got customers sprawled through this whole place.
[293:25.30]And one of them wants...
[293:29.21]Out of here.
[293:29.61]21 cents.
[293:30.27]Take it or leave it.
[293:32.81]31 cents.
[293:34.51]Then leave.
[293:41.30]Now you want a helmet.
[293:42.74]That's a little too much.
[293:46.60]I'm not gonna... No.
[293:48.14]I'm not gonna sell this to you.
[293:49.48]Yeah, please.
[293:52.36]Don't.
[293:52.86]I'm not gonna... I gotta eat, you know?
[293:59.21]Ooh.
[294:03.19]I'm gonna start with 5 grand.
[294:04.35]Now I'll bring it down to 4,000.
[294:07.09]4,200.
[294:07.21]Oh, look who it is!
[294:27.96]How much for this?
[294:29.08]Well, for you, that's 2,000.
[294:32.78]Less than what I thought I have to pay.
[294:34.17]What?
[294:38.79]Could've sold for more?
[294:39.59]What's this lady?
[294:42.67]It pains me to part with this, but for your sake, I'll sell it to you.
[294:47.41]I don't want your dumb, like, cotton candy-filled crouton, please.
[294:55.54]I pretty much took that for free.
[295:01.70]My grandchild's been pestering me to get a treasure.
[295:08.63]Were they?
[295:11.01]Were they?
[295:11.33]No.
[295:11.51]$21,000.
[295:11.53]$30,000?
[295:13.63]I could probably get $30,000.
[295:32.94]Is that too much?
[295:35.60]How about 20, like 25?
[295:36.88]25,000.
[295:36.90]I don't have that kind of money.
[295:39.40]Shit.
[295:39.50]22,000?
[295:39.52]20,000?
[295:39.54]18?
[295:39.56]I mean, when am I going to sell this?
[296:03.06]22?
[296:03.08]No, no, no, no.
[296:08.39]What do you mean no?
[296:09.15]Don't sell low.
[296:11.39]But I wouldn't be able to sell this.
[296:12.71]20?
[296:13.41]I'm going to say 22.
[296:18.25]No, he's not going to buy it.
[296:24.40]I'm going to sell that thing for like 15 grand.
[296:33.06]Sorry, I still made some money.
[296:37.60]Let's get the windbreaker out there.
[296:44.14]Still those bat wings.
[296:49.66]Welcome, what can I... We're getting all these other characters now.
[296:54.76]Yeah, that girl who's hanging out near the windows earlier.
[296:57.57]Stained glassed yayness.
[296:59.69]I'm glad you came in.
[297:00.73]What can I get you?
[297:03.11]Arma.
[297:07.14]Oh, is that your name?
[297:07.94]So is that like Miss Arma?
[297:09.54]Like a last name?
[297:10.44]Or... Miss Arma.
[297:13.28]Negative.
[297:14.46]Arma.
[297:16.16]So you're saying just call me Arma then?
[297:19.90]Affirmative.
[297:22.77]Well, I'm Receet.
[297:23.57]Nice to meet you, Arma.
[297:26.31]Receet.
[297:30.31]Yep.
[297:32.31]State the purpose of this facility.
[297:35.88]The purpose of... Okay, to start with... I'm sorry, I blacked out there for a minute.
[297:43.36]How long is it... Am I still here?
[297:46.62]How long was I out for?
[297:49.77]So you buy and sell items here.
[297:53.03]A material distribution center.
[297:54.63]Understood.
[297:56.79]Unity.
[297:57.45]Precision.
[297:59.25]I'm the best car in Hearthstone.
[298:01.80]Okay, so what do you want?
[298:03.86]I'm taking this object then.
[298:09.44]Geek, wait!
[298:09.86]No, you can't just take things!
[298:11.14]What are you doing?
[298:11.68]Get back here!
[298:13.90]There is a problem.
[298:16.09]Well, if you want to have something distributed, you gotta pay me!
[298:19.49]Money!
[298:21.07]Money.
[298:21.67]Term unidentified.
[298:25.15]Elaborate.
[298:28.04]I need to explain money?
[298:29.20]Yikes, I better start all over then.
[298:32.01]So, uh, how do I explain what money is?
[298:34.65]Well, the money we use is referred to as picks.
[298:38.53]Oh, oh.
[298:40.99]Um, I'm, I'm, I don't know what's going on.
[298:43.18]I think I have to go to a doctor.
[298:46.88]That's not normal, right?
[298:48.52]That shouldn't be happening.
[298:50.82]Uh, money, money.
[298:54.30]Yeah, could you have a car?
[298:55.12]Do you have a car?
[298:57.38]I think, yeah, this is not normal.
[299:05.43]This is happening more than I thought it was gonna happen.
[299:12.93]Understood.
[299:14.51]I currently lack money, and am therefore unable to perform shopping.
[299:20.92]Come back sometime!
[299:26.14]That was exhausting.
[299:26.98]I hope she does come back.
[299:33.46]Who the fuck are you?
[299:35.98]Oh, oh yeah, that's another fairy.
[299:38.92]How much is this selling for?
[299:40.32]How about a good $5.50?
[299:45.64]I don't care what you think or smell.
[299:50.56]Is that really that much money?
[299:58.45]Like a bandit.
[300:02.30]Bye, Bandit.
[300:03.16]Hey, you know, Otto's name was gonna be Bandit.
[300:12.31]I'd like this.
[300:15.41]You're back.
[300:20.66]Alright, this last time I did five grand, it came down.
[300:23.40]Let's do four grand or 3,800.
[300:30.72]38, 36, 37?
[300:33.76]38.
[300:40.88]What?
[300:42.66]This is like a rare fucking item.
[300:44.28]This is a rare dungeon item.
[300:48.49]This lady's too cheap.
[300:49.43]33.
[300:51.05]I didn't get scammed.
[301:03.74]How much for the cherries?
[301:04.58]They're all the cherries.
[301:05.45]They're 1,100.
[301:05.69]Welcome.
[301:07.61]This, please.
[301:08.03]All fish is 1,200.
[301:08.43]Welcome.
[301:27.25]You're back.
[301:28.61]I would like some food.
[301:30.53]I just sold you some, but you know.
[301:33.17]We got baked yams, candy.
[301:36.37]Uh, let's go with the baked yam.
[301:38.74]How's that?
[301:39.42]Absolutely.
[301:40.04]How about, uh, it's $2,200 for baked yam.
[301:43.92]There it is.
[301:51.08]That's a pretty good couple of sales.
[301:57.76]I need 80,000 bucks.
[302:01.77]Scam.
[302:02.25]The yam scam.
[302:04.27]Scam yam.
[302:05.99]Oh!
[302:10.53]Price of shields.
[302:11.23]I think I have a few of those left, don't I?
[302:17.07]Did I sell all the shields?
[302:19.25]Shit, I did, didn't I?
[302:31.03]A. A. A. Come on in.
[302:46.93]Welcome to receipt here.
[302:49.85]Oh.
[302:51.57]This place isn't nearly as nice as I thought it would be.
[302:54.61]Can these people really get me what I need?
[302:57.83]Excuse me?
[303:00.10]Well, I've got no choice.
[303:01.62]God keeps striding forward.
[303:04.36]You there, go fetch the owner of this place.
[303:06.18]I have business with him.
[303:08.86]The owner?
[303:09.34]Well, you're looking at her.
[303:10.48]What can I do for you?
[303:12.37]Surely you're joking.
[303:13.15]Don't waste my time, girl.
[303:15.65]Huh?
[303:15.99]No, really.
[303:16.45]I'm the owner.
[303:16.91]Can I help you?
[303:17.41]Uh, sir?
[303:23.79]You dare make a fool out of me?
[303:25.48]You must think I'm just some idiot kid.
[303:30.61]No, I, uh... You expect me to believe someone as short as you owns this establishment?
[303:37.17]Stop playing with me and bring me the new owner now.
[303:41.47]Shut up.
[303:42.07]I am the owner, really.
[303:45.76]What in the world is going on here?
[303:47.10]Why are you shouting at a customer?
[303:49.64]Tear.
[303:50.74]Listen, he's being... Oh, murder.
[303:54.46]Some kind of problem, I assume.
[303:57.02]Hmm?
[303:58.13]A fairy?
[303:59.89]Interesting.
[304:00.73]Not what I expected.
[304:03.09]Pardon?
[304:04.85]Physically slight and at a disadvantage against larger creatures, but innately talented at administration and management.
[304:12.62]Quite possibly the only non-human race to easily adapt to human culture by utilizing their unique talents.
[304:21.12]In other words... You...
[304:26.80]You must be the proprietor, Madam Fairy.
[304:30.38]Good day.
[304:31.12]I apologize for having to raise my voice at your servant.
[304:35.00]Oh, well.
[304:36.88]No, hang on just a second.
[304:39.66]It's a pleasure to meet you, Madam Fairy.
[304:42.12]Caillou is my name, and I am a magician by trade, and I need to place an order for some regents.
[304:50.35]An item order?
[304:52.33]Very well.
[304:52.79]What can I get you?
[304:54.63]I require three items specifically.
[304:57.07]A charred lizard, a batwing, and slime liver.
[305:00.23]I only need one of each.
[305:02.05]There's no need for a precise deadline, but obviously the sooner you can provide them, the better it will be for everyone.
[305:08.15]Can I assume you'll take the order?
[305:11.34]Naturally, we shall obtain what you need as soon as we can.
[305:14.58]Marvelous.
[305:15.28]Well then, if you'll excuse me.
[305:17.84]You know, I...
[305:20.81]Ah, yes, you look... Look, don't cause your boss trouble, alright?
[305:25.46]Pretending to be the owner like that will only make you look foolish.
[305:30.44]What?
[305:30.64]I am the owner!
[305:35.23]Now there's no need to get angry about this.
[305:38.81]Simple mistake, nothing more.
[305:41.55]If it's so simple, then why do you look so happy about it?
[305:43.63]That's not true.
[305:46.10]You clearly misunderstand me.
[305:48.06]Yes, clearly.
[305:48.86]I haven't.
[305:50.32]I can take some of that stuff off the shelf.
[305:53.84]Alright, you want the fish?
[305:58.58]$1300.
[305:59.34]Thank you.
[306:00.17]Thank you.
[306:01.49]Uh, thank you.
[306:03.13]Thank you.
[306:04.67]Oh, hi, welcome.
[306:06.53]I'll lower myself to buying something from you.
[306:08.33]A hat.
[306:13.29]I just, like, swing a piece of plywood at her.
[306:17.28]You know how hard it is to swing a giant piece of plywood?
[306:22.75]I don't have that, sorry.
[306:23.53]Oh, I'll take a beeple!
[306:28.55]2400!
[306:31.51]It's not easy to swing a giant, huge piece of plywood.
[306:47.09]It takes a lot of strength.
[306:50.93]They do that shit at CrossFit.
[306:52.31]They pick up big plywood sheets and swing them against the air resistance.
[307:10.24]This is desired.
[307:12.02]You don't eat food.
[307:14.02]Oh, hey, the robot doesn't know shit.
[307:20.56]Yeah, it's 30,000.
[307:23.43]30,000.
[307:23.89]Oh.
[307:25.57]Okay.
[307:31.19]I bought the beef for 2,400.
[307:32.27]No, I didn't.
[307:34.60]You bought the beef bowl.
[307:35.54]Not for 2,400.
[307:35.78]I didn't buy it for 2,400.
[307:36.32]I don't understand.
[307:46.63]Oh, yes.
[307:47.17]That strange robot lady just touched.
[307:51.17]Own it now.
[308:04.15]Any chance I can get you to buy this from me?
[308:06.27]Ooh, chocolate.
[308:07.81]20 bucks.
[308:08.99]Thank you.
[308:09.57]I got it.
[308:17.46]A bracelet.
[308:18.42]I don't have a bracelet.
[308:20.84]Sorry, go home again.
[308:22.92]I scammed myself twice.
[308:24.12]I just bought that for 200 bucks.
[308:29.48]I just bought that for way less.
[308:33.90]I may have fucked up the first one.
[308:38.70]Hey, could I purchase this?
[308:40.38]Yes, you can.
[308:41.28]For 2400 bucks.
[308:52.18]How's the item business treating you?
[308:54.32]Receipt?
[308:56.18]I think I can give you a hand on that score.
[308:57.84]How much for this?
[309:00.22]That's the cloth robe.
[309:01.14]We'll do $1,200.
[309:02.29]Okay, should I just overcharge the hell out of this person?
[309:08.81]Hold on, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[309:17.92]Meh, own it now.
[309:19.90]Robot lady just touched.
[309:21.50]Meh, own it now.
[309:27.16]Right, whatever.
[309:27.73]Okay, so I made it back.
[309:33.81]Ooh!

[310:20.15]Get out of here.
[310:20.71]Don't come back.
[310:23.48]That person won't buy anything.
[310:24.78]Just leave.
[310:26.04]There are signs of a boom in longswords among men who know quality.
[310:32.14]The price... Anyways, so let's put longswords out.
[310:46.35]Which one should I choose?
[310:47.19]What do you want?
[310:50.77]What do you want?
[310:51.35]What do you want?
[310:51.73]What do you want?
[311:17.65]I don't want to get rid of all my food.
[311:18.76]Food's gonna bloom here soon, I know it.
[311:20.64]Give me something else up there.
[311:22.84]Eh, let's just get rid of this inventory and then go sell stuff.
[311:27.92]I mean, go buy stuff.
[311:28.82]You know what I'm trying to say.
[311:34.66]Mommy asked me to sell this.
[311:35.74]Go away.
[311:38.57]Oh, hi.
[311:45.43]Please produce a piece of armor.
[311:50.87]Raincoat?
[311:54.13]Will you take a raincoat?
[311:59.93]Bum-ba-da-ba.
[312:01.25]Bum-ba-da-ba.
[312:06.00]Oh, it's bum-ba-da-ba.
[312:08.20]Alright.
[312:11.50]Acceptable.
[312:22.48]What are you doing?
[312:24.21]Oh, hi.
[312:25.91]Welcome.
[312:26.31]Let me try.
[312:26.91]I'll get it right.
[312:43.95]I'll get it.
[312:46.38]Why is everybody freaking out?
[312:47.36]Everybody's freaking out.
[312:48.38]I didn't even do anything.
[312:52.03]I did- I didn't do anything.
[313:04.27]I could probably do it too.
[313:09.37]That's too expensive.
[313:10.69]1300, you can't afford it.
[313:17.68]I know I could do it really well.
[313:21.11]No, no, no, no, no, no!
[313:24.43]Sell me this.
[313:25.29]No!
[313:25.91]Take the other one.
[313:26.69]Take the better one.
[313:27.80]Shit.
[313:28.30]Whatever.
[313:28.66]Well, at least you're on it.
[313:39.34]Candy apple! 1800!
[313:49.43]There's no reason to be mad.
[313:50.73]I did... Okay, when I went... Like, everyone was just like... A wave of just upset people were just fucking flowing.
[314:11.34]I just bought the camera.
[314:12.20]Well, I'm being distracted by people screaming at me.
[314:27.67]I hope he comes in and buys it.
[314:30.67]Alright, I need to go to the store.
[314:31.63]I'm going to get the thief's knife.
[314:38.73]Price is currently done.
[314:42.06]And I'm going to get the crafter's knife.
[314:48.46]Parade armor.
[314:49.40]Ooh.
[315:00.00]I can't do shields.
[315:01.20]Parade helm?
[315:02.22]No, no, no.
[315:14.33]Go to market.
[315:18.15]Get back here.
[315:18.57]Let me put this down.
[315:20.06]No, shit.
[315:20.74]Whatever.
[315:26.84]Do the voice right now.
[315:27.78]No, I think that's like an 80-20 percentage of people that want me to not do it.
[315:34.63]The price of accessories has decreased.
[315:36.45]The price of daggers has normalized.
[315:40.03]Good.
[315:40.89]There were fake items and scams.
[315:43.69]Alright, so there we go.
[315:45.13]We can put the thief's knife up here.
[315:51.21]Let's get rid of these rusty daggers.
[315:59.18]And let's do some fish.
[316:01.86]Chocolate?
[316:03.52]No, the beef.
[316:04.32]What about accessories?
[316:09.30]Hold on a minute here.
[316:10.25]This is cheaper, isn't it?
[316:12.77]What's the price cut on that?
[316:18.92]14,900.
[316:18.98]Get that out of here.
[316:23.20]Is the vase an accessory?
[316:27.50]No.
[316:28.26]It's a treasure.
[316:28.90]Alright, let's go.
[316:32.11]Wait.
[316:33.87]Don't ignore us, Jeremy.
[316:46.32]Got a piece of armor.
[316:48.20]Um, I did.
[316:51.71]I did, but not anymore.
[316:53.15]Goodbye.
[316:57.59]Ugh, I can't do it, guys.
[316:59.33]I'm gonna lose people.
[317:00.79]Ooh!
[317:01.13]I already have five.
[317:05.80]Okay.
[317:05.98]4,000?
[317:06.00]I could probably do 4,200.
[317:16.86]4,000 is probably safe here.
[317:27.06]Welcome.
[317:27.42]Do you have some food?
[317:29.58]Yes, we do.
[317:31.48]You want an orange?
[317:32.14]700 bucks.
[317:33.36]800.
[317:33.40]That's too expensive.
[317:34.06]Well, then...
[317:50.33]That was at base value.
[317:53.12]Any chance I can get you to buy this?
[317:54.62]I don't want to buy any more bread.
[317:57.98]30 cents.
[317:59.60]Is it really?
[318:00.16]Yes, 30 cents.
[318:02.54]Sometimes you gotta stick with your guns.
[318:11.07]My daughter-in-law asked me to pick this up.
[318:14.55]She sure did.
[318:15.11]750.
[318:15.13]700.
[318:15.19]Take it or leave it.
[318:29.47]Little lady, I'd like to get two treasures.
[318:32.25]If I come to pick them up in two days, will you have them?
[318:36.08]Yep.
[318:37.00]You're gonna... You didn't say the price.
[318:39.24]It's gonna be like $40,000 worth of stuff.
[318:40.94]What should I put?
[318:43.76]What should I put?
[318:55.06]Very odd vase, 21,000.
[318:57.30]And an unthankful statue.
[319:03.75]What the hell is this bill?
[319:05.79]You didn't specify how expensive.
[319:17.10]No one's gonna be able to afford any of this shit.
[319:23.79]Adventurous Guild is closed.
[319:30.79]Oh, wait a minute.
[319:31.23]I can buy a couple.
[319:31.77]I'm going to buy this.
[319:33.98]Yeah, these are cheap right now.
[319:39.10]Ooh, these are cheap.
[319:40.82]Healing Ring?
[319:47.65]Purity Ring?
[319:56.81]Honest to God, sometimes, I'm telling you guys, sometimes you have to fucking go nuts.
[320:01.73]Because I'm gonna sell this shit and I'm gonna make back like fucking $50,000, $60,000.
[320:13.20]When those prices normalize.
[320:14.58]But what about your credit score?
[320:18.44]I'll be fine.
[320:28.14]How many days do I have?
[320:29.72]1, 2, 3... I've got like 4 days.
[320:31.54]Oh, shit.
[320:32.62]Okay, I need to have $80,000.
[320:33.38]I can do it.
[320:34.64]I can do it.
[320:34.98]I can do it.
[321:06.10]They're actually fucking dead.
[321:07.26]No, I'm not.
[321:08.26]I'm not dead.
[321:11.20]I'm gonna... Everything's gonna be fine.
[321:14.87]Time to replace your blood with spinach.
[321:19.13]Everything's gonna be fine.
[321:20.99]Do you see this shit?
[321:22.89]Ten fucking grand, eight grand, seven grand, six grand.
[321:30.37]It's gonna be just fine.
[321:35.66]Let's sell our food.
[321:36.68]Baked yams, candy apples, and all this shit.
[321:41.26]I'm ready.
[321:41.58]Let's go.
[321:44.34]Sell the vase?
[321:45.54]No one's gonna buy it.
[321:52.45]And I could take this shit to the market and sell it at an extreme loss.
[321:56.87]The vase is for the old man, yeah.
[322:01.99]What should I do?
[322:03.05]I'll open the store.
[322:07.13]Here we go.
[322:08.09]Let's be reasonable with this.
[322:10.11]2,000.
[322:10.57]A bit expensive.
[322:13.75]1,800.
[322:13.77]Here we go.
[322:17.54]String it together.
[322:18.16]Okay.

[323:46.51]We're gonna get a price skyrocket.
[323:47.83]Here comes the news.
[323:50.39]The price of armor has increased shit.
[323:55.04]I was gonna go buy armor.
[324:02.74]He just... He just... Fucked me so bad.
[324:07.38]He just completely fucked me over.
[324:10.15]He knew I was gonna do that.
[324:10.99]He knows me too well.
[324:13.27]I have to go adventure.
[324:14.59]But I need to sell stuff.
[324:19.17]You can still buy it.
[324:22.43]So glad I got those floors and carpets.
[324:26.75]It's not dire yet.
[324:29.83]It's not... Hold on.
[324:30.97]Change flooring!
[324:35.54]Take a look at that.
[324:37.60]Now we've got a store.
[324:39.28]It's not dire.
[324:39.98]It's only dire when I... It's not dire yet.
[324:42.51]It's not dire.
[324:43.37]I still have plenty of time.
[324:44.51]I have today, tomorrow, the next day, and the next day.
[324:48.77]This time.
[324:54.85]Once these prices normalize here, I'm going to make a ton of money.
[325:01.51]I may even try... No, that's for Grandpa.
[325:03.25]These are for Grandpa.
[325:05.17]By the way, when is he, when's his order?
[325:17.68]Tomorrow.
[325:18.74]Old man.
[325:19.98]Two treasures.
[325:22.63]So tomorrow the old man's going to want the two treasures.
[325:24.99]Alright, now I gotta go.
[325:29.01]I wonder if it's worth...
[325:34.51]Should I go adventure?
[325:37.03]Sell a bowl of food?
[325:44.45]The batwing, I gotta get a... I gotta get the batwing up there.
[325:52.48]Adventure, adventure, adventure, adventure, adventure.
[325:54.82]A means adventure, right?
[325:56.18]Sell an adventure.
[325:57.04]You got it.
[325:57.48]Let's go.
[325:58.64]What should I do?
[325:59.40]I'm going to turn around, okay?
[326:03.78]Can I help you?
[326:05.32]I am procuring this item.
[326:06.92]800.
[326:07.24]Right then.
[326:10.95]Get this sorted, please.
[326:12.67]Two grand.
[326:13.83]Spare.
[326:33.73]Ah, this'll do.
[326:34.53]2,500.
[326:34.59]Come on, four back-to-back.
[326:47.15]Need to help your old pension, you see.
[326:49.05]What can I get for this?
[326:51.87]I don't want to buy things right now, but I'll give you 300 for it.
[326:54.47]A little more? 3,000.
[327:06.65]Alright, Ms.
[327:07.09]Capitalist, in two days I want you to get two foodstuffs for me.
[327:10.03]I can do that.
[327:16.57]I have two things of food.
[327:18.77]Do you have a bracelet?
[327:20.67]No, I got rings.
[327:25.31]Shit.
[327:33.94]I really don't want to sell this, but... I really don't want to buy this.
[327:38.58]500.
[327:43.91]650, and that's it.
[327:45.91]This is GameStop.
[327:57.64]GameStop values.
[328:00.00]I'd like some food, please.
[328:03.43]Alright, Grandpa's got a lot of money, so I'm gonna give him a bakey.
[328:05.45]That sounds good!
[328:05.83]2500.
[328:05.87]I don't have THAT kind of money!
[328:07.55]Shit, 2200.
[328:07.73]25,000.
[328:07.75]Time to adventure.
[328:37.34]Didn't you buy that yam for 2400?
[328:38.60]What's going on in the town square?
[328:46.60]What the?
[328:47.34]How peculiar, there's something shining in the fountain basin.
[328:50.42]Oh yeah, the coins in the fountain.
[328:51.55]Wow, there's a lot of coins in there.
[328:54.99]Can we reach in and scoop them up?
[328:57.57]Why are there coins in a public water display?
[329:00.53]Oh, I haven't done it in forever, though, really.
[329:01.71]Cool.
[329:36.08]Alright, Larry.
[329:38.05]You got a lot of expensive shit on you.
[329:47.79]Should I give him a ring?
[329:48.97]No.
[329:49.17]These are mine.
[329:50.19]Uh, let's bring the walnut bread.
[329:55.17]And, uh, a cherry.
[330:00.46]No, the orange.
[330:00.96]It's cheaper.
[330:04.36]Give him the book.
[330:08.51]A slapstick comedy about 200 warriors saving a village.
[330:11.15]This is humor.
[330:14.11]No, this is 1600 bucks.
[330:21.00]Boss rush?
[330:22.84]Wait, what?
[330:25.62]Boss rush.
[330:33.60]Alright, let's go.
[330:39.50]So it's three bosses, back to back.
[330:41.00]Come on, shrink.
[330:46.43]He shrunk even more.
[330:48.59]Oh shit, I took damage.
[331:07.56]God damn it.
[331:09.84]I'm gonna be fine.
[331:10.94]Don't worry.
[331:21.63]Does it give me any items?
[331:24.29]Go eat that.
[331:30.17]No snack.
[331:31.67]Snack on a mushroom, please.
[331:38.52]Yeah, it's Jimmy Tooth Teeth!
[331:42.16]It actually is like Jimmy Tooth Teeth.
[331:43.64]Eat something!
[331:44.20]Right in the back.
[331:51.48]Why is it not hurting him?
[332:07.89]Why is it not hurting him?
[332:14.48]There it is.
[332:17.30]You gotta get him right this side.
[332:20.92]It's your fault that it is.
[332:25.08]If you had your good boy, this is...
[332:40.41]He did it, he did it, he did it, he did it, he did it, he did the thing, he did it!
[332:43.01]Nothing else here, huh?
[332:51.80]And... versus... Charm!
[332:54.64]Alright, slow down, slow down.
[333:08.61]Got counter-attack.
[333:10.47]Just baiting the turn.
[333:13.18]Easy.
[333:16.68]So I just did it.
[333:17.40]What do I get for this?
[333:19.82]That's it?
[333:21.64]I just wasted like six hours of the day for this.
[333:24.16]I didn't get anything.
[333:29.89]Not a chest, not a... That was actually two slices of time.
[333:41.76]And it's over.
[333:42.22]Day's over.
[333:48.19]Alright.
[333:49.65]It is very... It's imperative that I can put those treasures up here.
[333:55.37]News.
[333:56.25]The price of long swords has decreased.
[333:59.25]The swords boom has ended.
[334:04.93]Fuck, how much... I have two days.
[334:07.12]Where's Grandpa?
[334:10.06]What is it?
[334:13.11]Today.
[334:13.71]Old man.
[334:14.19]Two treasures.
[334:14.79]Shit, these are still down.
[334:21.69]I'm going to give him the unthankful statue in a very odd phase.
[334:29.03]Go buy an expensive treasure?
[334:30.43]I can't.
[334:31.88]That's not a good idea.
[334:32.98]That's not a good idea, is it?
[334:36.38]Okay.
[334:42.85]I'm gonna- I have to sell them.
[334:48.05]10, like, 20, 30- this is like- this is how I do it.
[334:53.41]Let me save the game first.
[334:56.31]Just in case something catastrophic happens.
[335:01.01]Which it won't, I'm good.
[335:07.62]Hold it.
[335:08.04]Hold everything.
[335:08.80]Hold everything.
[335:13.40]No, I can't hold everything.
[335:14.60]I've got to get rid of something.
[335:17.04]I got five of these necklaces.
[335:22.18]Burn the shop down for insurance.
[335:26.91]I need 60 grand.
[335:28.35]It's... Yeah.
[335:29.83]Hold on.
[335:30.25]I need to make sure... I need to see something here.
[335:32.95]Is there an oh shit... There is... Okay, there is a... Oh my god.
[335:36.43]Look at this.
[335:44.61]I mean, there is a fuck you scenario.
[335:49.17]And I think I'll be able to do it.
[336:05.62]I can't buy any of this shit.
[336:12.63]Why did I not have armor?
[336:23.90]Oh, little receipt.
[336:24.70]Working hard, I hope.
[336:27.60]Are you out of town on a walk?
[336:29.40]That I am.
[336:30.42]I make a habit of getting out of the house on days like this.
[336:32.89]Walking in the sun like this is good for the soul.
[336:35.99]Clear days do feel nice.
[336:36.97]You stay indoors during periods of inclement weather, then?
[336:40.59]I know.
[336:40.99]Sun's good for the soul, but rain hardens the body.
[336:44.03]Besides, it's nice to see the city looking different on a rainy day.
[336:49.86]So then you just go for a walk every day?
[336:52.34]Yeah, well, I guess if you gotta be short about it, I do.
[336:59.80]How on Earth do you find that funny?
[337:04.63]What's the point of this stuff?
[337:06.63]Here we are in the chapel again.
[337:07.63]When I was little, I used to come here a lot, actually.
[337:10.27]Really, I must admit, you do not strike me as the pious type.
[337:14.29]When you came to the chapel, you'd get a stamp on a little card...
[337:18.43]With enough stamps, you get a piece of candy.
[337:21.39]So your primary motivation was the candy, not the fake?
[337:24.73]Yep.
[337:27.57]Oh my goodness.
[337:28.99]My previous judgment hit the sweet spot, it seems.
[337:33.12]So just don't click on these, is essentially what I'm getting from this.
[337:35.68]Alright, here we go.
[337:37.36]I need... What do I need to do here?
[337:41.76]I have to liquidate some shit.
[337:47.61]I need some liquidation Do fusion do I do I have anything to rank one staff I need a magic staff a buddy five bat wings I Don't have enough to do that.
[338:04.54]I Need to five insect traps and one arm better on hip three I
[338:15.52]I need a charred lizard.
[338:17.00]I don't have that.
[338:18.74]It's over.
[338:30.13]It's not over.
[338:32.23]Watch what I... Hold on, there's another thing of lore here.
[338:35.83]I have to have a big lunch time to dig.
[338:41.68]It's been... I can... I had to buy them.
[338:44.34]Oh, I didn't know the rings were gonna be on this, like, super downward trend for the last, like, five days.
[338:50.06]I thought I was gonna be able to buy them and, like, a day or two later start to sell them.
[338:53.77]They're still down.
[338:55.03]It's been, like, six days.
[338:56.43]Woof, woof.
[339:00.83]Are you hungry, too?
[339:01.89]Huh?
[339:02.07]You look pretty lean.
[339:05.13]I'll give you half of it.
[339:06.75]Hey, don't woof it down!
[339:07.83]Woof, woof, woof, woof.
[339:11.37]Tasty, isn't it?
[339:12.11]I spent a long time picking it out.
[339:13.41]I hope you like it.
[339:14.01]Am I feeding the dog grass?
[339:18.79]Louie's really kind, isn't he?
[339:21.33]To be honest, I thought he and the dog would end up fighting for the food.
[339:24.09]That'd be sad.
[339:27.58]Alright.
[339:35.24]I gotta start to make moves here.
[339:37.88]I need this fucking money.
[339:38.84]Hey!
[339:44.36]I need it.
[339:44.88]I have to sell it.
[339:45.72]And this is way more than what I bought it for.
[339:56.91]Wait until tomorrow?
[339:58.77]That's why... I have to sell these.
[340:03.58]I don't have any armor.
[340:12.73]Unless, like, hey, is it necklace armor?
[340:18.98]Is it ring armor, technically?
[340:20.74]Okay, here we go.
[340:37.01]I went and bought this, but no one uses it.
[340:38.83]Will you take it?
[340:39.64]No!
[340:40.18]I don't want it!
[340:40.90]I don't want it.
[340:51.62]Do you have the treasures?
[340:52.88]Oh, I do!
[340:53.28]I got you a backscratcher and a $22,000 vase.
[340:59.66]What about this?
[341:06.19]Yes!
[341:07.91]Oh, shit!
[341:08.55]Okay, hold on, hold on.
[341:09.65]This is important.
[341:12.64]30?
[341:12.72]Can I get... I need to get 25,000 right now.
[341:18.08]I just screamed so loud.
[341:19.14]I'm really sorry.
[341:25.44]No, it can't be 30.
[341:26.68]It's gonna be too much.
[341:31.26]I have to... I have to... This has to happen.
[341:38.26]It has to be like 20 or like 22.
[341:40.10]I'm going to do 20.
[341:43.40]I have to.
[341:45.05]I lose if I don't get at least 10 to 20 grand.
[341:47.05]22.
[341:48.51]Got it.
[341:51.87]Alright.
[341:52.57]I'm fine.
[341:52.87]Everything's good.
[341:53.61]It was $22,000.
[341:54.77]Now everything's fine.
[341:57.51]Never go.
[341:57.99]I had to.
[342:01.89]I had to do that.
[342:04.39]I desire a book.
[342:05.23]I got a book.
[342:18.92]I'm good.
[342:22.93]No, they don't buy it for the base price.
[342:24.85]Remember I did that before and the guy told me to fuck myself?
[342:28.91]No, they don't have that much money.
[342:45.12]Yeah, by the way, I found that vase.
[342:47.10]I didn't buy that vase.
[342:48.14]That was pure profit.
[342:51.58]We found this when cleaning the cellar.
[342:52.98]Is it worth anything?
[342:54.45]It's worth zero.
[342:55.77]You found bread in the cellar.
[342:58.21]In fact, I'm insulted that you would come here and try to sell this to me.
[343:20.01]Food.
[343:20.31]I bought the fish?
[343:30.95]Motherfuck.
[343:33.84]My decisions are my decisions, alright?
[343:35.76]Leave my decisions alone.
[343:37.92]You're in the store arguing with me while I'm trying to have customers come in.
[343:43.24]Imagine you went into a store and you saw that somebody sold something for cheaper and you were like, Wow, you're stupid for selling that cheaper.
[343:49.18]By the way, do you have any candy apples?
[343:52.33]Oh, fuck.
[343:52.95]I just like dropped something.
[343:59.67]I want some food.
[344:00.29]Hold on.
[344:02.23]Candy apple.
[344:02.87]No, no, no.
[344:03.43]This girl never ever buys anything for more than like two or three hundred bucks.
[344:07.43]Take some chocolate.
[344:11.48]That's... You're not gonna buy it.
[344:12.94]I knew it!
[344:13.46]I knew it!
[344:13.80]500!
[344:13.88]Get out of here!
[344:14.44]50,000.
[344:14.46]I'm good.
[344:14.66]I need 30,000 more dollars.
[344:15.39]We've got two days.
[344:15.87]I got plenty of stuff.
[344:16.49]Wait a minute.
[344:19.59]Hold on.
[344:19.83]What is it?
[344:38.96]Two pieces of armor and two foodstuffs.
[344:41.50]I need two armors.
[344:53.41]Like, can I just put two raincoats in here?
[344:57.93]I'm just gonna put two pieces of clothes in here.
[345:16.92]Does it have to be armor It doesn't matter look 420 840 dollars.
[345:23.67]Okay.
[345:23.95]I'm gonna sell it to him for a thousand.
[345:25.23]I don't give a shit What's done is done?
[345:32.94]Evening, you see.
[345:34.25]Out for an evening stroll?
[345:35.23]A bit late, isn't it?
[345:37.67]It is a bit late, I guess.
[345:39.91]What are you up to, sir?
[345:41.51]Oh, stargazing.
[345:47.26]I just tried to press escape and it didn't work.
[345:53.22]Well, stargazing is pleasant enough, but do you mind the cold?
[345:55.44]You will not be very romantic if you come with the flu.
[345:58.66]Good advice.
[345:59.21]Bye.
[346:04.47]Good night.
[346:08.64]24 grand, come on.
[346:10.48]I'm gonna get there.
[346:14.88]Stargazing with, you know, his five rusty knives.
[346:19.89]The chilly season is here.
[346:21.77]Those sensitive to cold should bundle up.
[346:25.43]The price of accessories has normalized.
[346:27.63]Who should I choose?
[346:28.53]What should I choose?
[346:36.74]We're good.
[346:37.26]I live for this.
[346:45.74]Let's go.
[346:51.81]Welcome to... Murph?
[346:56.45]Good day.
[346:57.29]Have you completed my order yet?
[346:59.43]No.
[347:01.20]Well, you see...
[347:02.83]What?
[347:03.23]You still don't have it?
[347:05.26]I should have known this place would be unreliable.
[347:08.64]Oh, but... Well, nothing for it.
[347:11.72]And to be fair, some of those items are a bear.
[347:14.36]The slime livers from normal slimes are too small for starters.
[347:18.89]I need something from one that's... bigger.
[347:22.25]Bat wings shouldn't be too hard if you hunt the eyeball bats, though.
[347:26.19]I've always heard that gnolls and giant mice are fond of charred lizards.
[347:31.02]Gnolls?
[347:32.47]The dog-like creature's never seen one.
[347:35.25]Throws rocks, punches real hard.
[347:37.86]The manuals of beasts and monsters name those creatures as gnolls.
[347:42.68]Oh, I see.
[347:43.24]I didn't know.
[347:44.82]Well, among adventurers, it's common knowledge.
[347:48.42]More to the point, however, while I did not set a deadline, I'm not the immortal kind of wizard.
[347:54.23]Not yet, anyway.
[347:57.65]I'd really like for your boss to get the regents as soon as she can.
[348:02.11]Please let her know I'm getting a little impatient.
[348:07.01]Worst part about it?
[348:07.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[348:12.67]I assume you have my foodstuffs?
[348:13.85]I do.
[348:17.57]Let's do expensive shit.
[348:18.80]So let's do candy apple and a fish.
[348:23.80]So that's $16, $26, $2700.
[348:33.79]Hire, idiot.
[348:34.09]Hire, idiot.
[348:34.59]What do you mean, hire, idiot?
[348:35.27]More than 133%?
[348:35.49]Pieces of armor.
[348:35.81]Okay.
[348:35.91]Okay.
[348:36.01]That's what you're looking for.
[348:39.43]I see.
[348:39.55]Very good choice.
[349:07.43]is wrong with people.
[349:10.89]What?
[349:12.83]Do you have a hat?
[349:15.87]I don't have hats.
[349:19.43]Somebody buy an accessory.
[349:20.43]I'm done.
[349:21.01]I don't want to order.
[349:21.77]Somebody buy something.
[349:24.93]Can I get some food?
[349:25.67]Oh my fucking god.
[349:26.97]Sure, here.
[349:27.65]Have something cheap because you don't have any money.
[349:29.94]How about a piece of bread?
[349:33.82]That'll be $120.
[349:35.54]That's a little too much.
[349:36.48]Just fucking take it.
[349:37.22]Get out of here.
[349:37.60]Just take it.
[349:43.28]Welcome.
[349:44.39]Two weapons required in three days.
[349:46.31]Can you provide?
[349:47.87]Yes.
[349:49.69]Somebody buy something.
[349:53.11]Oh no.
[349:53.61]Oh no.
[349:55.41]The price of weapons has increased.
[350:03.17]I have... somebody has to buy these.
[350:05.15]Nobody wants the fucking rings.
[350:15.05]Shit.
[350:17.09]Come on, just open the store and somebody buy it.
[350:23.12]No, I don't want any more of this.
[350:26.11]No, hey, good day, it's me, gonna need to do my order?
[350:28.31]He's gonna come in every day.
[350:34.27]I don't have time for this, just go.
[350:39.87]I'll do it, just... Welcome.
[350:46.01]I need two foodstuffs.
[350:48.05]If I return in three days, oh my god.
[350:51.17]Nobody wants anything now, they want things after I crumble under debt.
[351:00.08]I've been wanting a fish.
[351:08.23]She's always complaining that I don't charge enough.
[351:10.51]No, I don't want any bread.
[351:15.79]I don't want any bread.
[351:16.61]Hello.
[351:31.75]She's finally gonna take this.
[351:33.01]Somebody please buy an accessory.
[351:40.00]Looking for an accessory?
[351:43.50]No.
[351:43.64]Mom wants... Hmm?
[351:59.47]Everyone wants to sell shit to me.
[352:00.83]No one wants to buy anything.
[352:02.27]Do you have a... No, I don't have a book.
[352:07.05]I have a lot of accessories.
[352:12.40]I'm so close.
[352:14.20]I'm so close.
[352:14.82]Somebody buy a ring.
[352:17.16]Old man, help me out here.
[352:18.40]No!
[352:19.78]No!
[352:31.18]I'll open the store now.
[352:34.59]Hello.
[352:34.75]How much do you want?
[353:03.21]Thank you very much!
[353:33.22]We get to keep going.
[353:40.40]So I find myself with a sudden need for two weapons.
[353:42.90]And I need them in two days.
[353:44.58]Sure.
[353:52.45]Why does the rich girl keep coming in and buying like bread?
[353:55.27]No, she wants me to buy her bread.
[354:03.35]I was tidying up and found old bread.
[354:07.29]Would you like to store my old shit in your house?
[354:34.21]Oh my god, please just... Okay, it's a necklace.
[354:45.88]Would you sell this to me?
[354:46.98]Yes, I would.
[354:47.26]1,300.
[354:47.28]Anybody else?
[354:47.60]Cherry?
[355:02.27]I'll take it.
[355:02.79]Cherries actually sell pretty well.
[355:03.95]I'll do 44% base price.
[355:04.47]I'll do 55%.
[355:04.91]You take, come on.
[355:05.61]People buy that.
[355:06.27]No, I'll put the necklace up here.
[355:34.56]Uh, I'll put the anti-venom up there too.
[355:44.33]And... Get the cherry up there.
[355:46.67]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[355:50.47]What the hell do people want?
[355:53.05]In three days, two... Okay, somebody wants two food.
[355:56.79]And I need a bunch of weapons, so I need... I've got plenty of food.
[356:02.46]I'll get there.
[356:08.46]Almost at 80 grand.
[356:10.31]The next one's gonna be like $150,000.
[356:12.67]Here we are.
[356:13.01]You want the ring.
[356:16.01]10 grand.
[356:16.17]No, no, no, no.
[356:16.47]96.
[356:16.49]90.
[356:16.51]9200. 9200.
[356:37.23]Shit.
[356:42.27]Eighty-five hundred.
[356:44.25]Eighty... Seventy-five.
[356:54.07]Seventy-six hundred.
[356:54.81]Is that too low?
[357:00.37]But I would still make a profit on it.
[357:02.04]I bought it for like three thousand.
[357:10.05]Yeah.
[357:10.39]No, it's worth it.
[357:10.83]That's worth it.
[357:11.27]It is.
[357:11.53]It really is.
[357:11.95]I think those are fireworks.
[357:17.91]I didn't get scammed.
[357:18.56]I bought that ring for like $3,900.
[357:19.54]That was a profit no matter how you swing it.
[357:25.16]And it guarantees I'll have a little bit of money tomorrow.
[357:31.14]When my grandmother died... Okay, I really don't mean like anything by that.
[357:35.03]Why does your... Your grandmother seems to keep dying.
[357:41.30]Is this the same... He keeps coming and says, Hey, my grandmother just died and she left me this beef bowl and I just want to get rid of it if it's possible.
[358:04.33]His grandmother dies like every day.
[358:15.57]What is your toll in filthy lucre?
[358:18.03]Eh, you can have the 13.5.
[358:20.65]The day is saved.
[358:22.23]I am procuring this chocolate bar.
[358:39.46]Item exceeds allowable price variance.
[358:42.42]Six times.
[358:47.71]Yeah, I sold the chocolate bar.
[358:49.43]Sick.
[358:52.63]Got a weapon.
[358:54.69]Oh, I sure do.
[358:56.29]You get the last rusty dagger.
[358:58.16]250%.
[358:59.14]Get out of here.
[359:13.58]Candy apple?
[359:15.52]But do you think I could sell it?
[359:17.62]I do.
[359:18.96]Candy apples do pretty well.
[359:20.14]I'll give it 700.
[359:20.70]300.
[359:20.74]Get it.
[359:20.98]Plus $40,000 in profit.
[359:23.62]I have enough to pay the debt.
[359:30.99]And...
[359:44.12]What time is it?
[359:44.90]I've been streaming this for six hours.
[359:49.15]Holy shit, the price of precious metals has decreased.
[359:52.83]Where do I buy gold?
[360:00.81]Alright, so we're playing this tomorrow, too.
[360:03.75]I kind of want to keep going.
[360:05.13]This game's fun.
[360:11.50]We'll go for a little bit longer.
[360:12.32]I'm not done yet.
[360:13.08]But we're doing this tomorrow.
[360:20.60]So, alright.
[360:23.01]I... I need to... Somebody said get rid of the Batwing already.
[360:29.77]I will.
[360:31.79]I will display the Batwing.
[360:39.92]Save the game.
[360:40.54]The top one's fine.
[360:48.69]The deck is due today.
[360:53.77]Foodstuffs.
[360:54.25]What's coming up?
[360:54.73]Foodstuffs, right?
[361:00.76]By tomorrow, I need two weapons.
[361:03.60]I gotta get four weapons, actually.
[361:11.08]Shit, weapons are expensive.
[361:15.66]I mean, I could just do two shitty swords.
[361:18.62]What do you think?
[361:19.92]Just, should I just get four shitty swords?
[361:24.08]Just wait till tomorrow?
[361:30.26]What if I rank one staff?
[361:31.78]I need five Batwing.
[361:33.13]I think I gotta go back in the dungeon eventually here too.
[361:39.86]These things sell for a ton.
[361:45.02]Alright, let's pay the debt.
[361:48.18]The price of heavy armor has increased.
[361:52.26]And the cold weather gear boom has ended.
[361:53.72]I don't think I have any armor.
[361:57.25]Um... I'm gonna go... Let's go dungeon.
[361:59.47]Now.
[362:07.75]I don't need to take anything with me.
[362:11.18]But I'm out of... Is this really the only two places I can do?
[362:16.46]I have to do floor 11 to 15.
[362:20.56]I wasted a slice?
[362:21.44]Ah, fuck, you're right.
[362:33.54]I need items.
[362:34.14]Okay, let's go.
[362:39.30]Okay, let's go.
[362:42.97]Dammit.
[362:43.35]Wait, there it is.
[362:45.95]There's a floating eye.
[362:47.75]Holy fuck, what just happened?
[362:55.68]I need to find... Not bat wings.
[362:58.92]I need the silly putty.
[363:01.18]I need two more of those.
[363:04.27]Who drops the little putty snake stuff?
[363:07.43]These guys?
[363:08.17]No.
[363:16.17]I have to watch the events to unlock new characters and maps.
[363:19.33]I've been doing that.
[363:20.52]And all they do is just run into people and say, Hey, what are you doing outside?
[363:24.84]Looking outside.
[363:26.16]Cool, it's fun to be outside.
[363:27.62]Yes, it is.
[363:29.00]That's been the last, like, five events.
[363:35.37]I don't need that.
[363:46.65]But it is fun to be outside!
[363:48.05]You're right, it is!
[363:48.83]That wing.
[363:55.93]That's not what I need, though.
[363:58.34]These guys are supposed to drop shit, right?
[363:59.86]Ooh, what is... what's that?
[364:05.92]Red oil.
[364:17.30]Cap.
[364:19.84]Ow.
[364:23.68]Chestnut.
[364:24.62]Don't need it, but this is an item collection run.
[364:27.06]I better not leave without items.
[364:34.01]Nothing.
[364:34.27]Come on.
[364:39.57]There it is.
[364:40.41]Got it.
[364:42.01]Charred lizard.
[364:42.69]That is a $14,000 necklace, right?
[364:48.39]Beautiful.
[364:50.91]Do the rabbits drop anything?
[365:00.91]I don't think they do.
[365:02.49]I love the little fur balls.
[365:11.11]Slime liver is right.
[365:15.23]The liver only drops from the boss slime.
[365:17.65]Really?
[365:20.94]Seems kind of odd.
[365:36.15]Mushroom, just take it.
[365:39.57]He literally explained this.
[365:42.87]I mean, if you think that I was paying attention to 40% even of the dialog on the screen,
[365:50.02]I really just wasn't.
[365:52.14]And I'm assuming a majority of everybody here can say the same thing.
[365:58.91]Cursor on the screen?
[365:59.75]I don't... Where?
[366:01.43]Where?
[366:01.67]There's no cursor on the screen.
[366:08.61]Why?
[366:16.17]It's not good to lie.
[366:18.25]Where's my fucking mouse?
[366:26.00]It's under the desk.
[366:29.40]That was what fell down earlier.
[366:31.50]I got it.
[366:31.94]I got it.
[366:32.60]Hold on.
[366:36.61]I saw it.
[366:37.05]It was there.
[366:45.82]Just cover it with your own mouse.
[366:47.40]That's, you know, that's a 500 IQ play.
[366:52.53]Get them all.
[366:57.65]Ooh, that felt kinda good.
[367:03.98]Bugs.
[367:05.54]Dammit.
[367:06.62]They usually drop the, um, the thing I'm looking for.
[367:09.90]No, nobody wants a common wooden shield.
[367:14.03]Nobody wants that.
[367:21.97]Level 16.
[367:22.59]Shotgun.
[367:29.39]Does sell for a lot.
[367:39.43]So is it... It's a percentage chance to just drop from the slime boss.
[367:45.34]So I need to just do the slime boss over and over again.
[367:54.36]Is this Monster Hunter?
[367:55.30]Ooh, that's a nice helm.
[367:56.44]Warrior's helm.
[367:59.56]Bring back the cursor.
[368:21.07]It's not coming back.
[368:22.51]Hey, it'll come back tomorrow.
[368:23.51]When I play this tomorrow, you'll see it.
[368:30.77]I'm kind of addicted to this game.
[368:33.61]It's such a simple concept, but it's... it's fun.
[368:37.85]Nice, get rid of all the bugs.
[368:43.89]Yes!
[368:44.13]Alright, I need one more of these.
[368:49.01]One more of those things and I can fuse the, uh... Try Moonlighter.
[368:59.54]It's similar.
[369:02.58]I gotta go to a surprise party.
[369:03.86]You gotta stream it again after tomorrow.
[369:07.33]We'll see.
[369:11.77]If I'm still addicted and I'm still having fun, I don't know, we'll just do it again.
[369:16.34]Moonlighter is kind of bad, says Lucratius.
[369:19.14]Look, it's bad.
[369:20.56]Uh-oh.
[369:22.87]Did you just start a fighting chat?
[369:33.71]It's a good game.
[369:35.47]What's wrong with it?
[369:37.28]This is the only thing we play now.
[369:44.37]Special inkwell?
[369:46.03]I'm getting some treasures here.
[369:51.72]But that's just like your opinion, man.
[369:53.34]Well, it's not my opinion.
[369:54.20]I've never played it.
[369:56.08]It could be great.
[369:56.64]It could be bad.
[369:57.64]It could be awful.
[369:58.22]It could be fun.
[369:58.78]I don't know.
[370:03.15]Forget about the mushrooms.
[370:05.49]Although, I don't know, dude.
[370:06.41]I might need them eventually or something to make a fusion.
[370:09.75]I don't know.
[370:23.58]I'm the top receder stream worldwide.
[370:25.87]It's probably because I'm the only receder stream worldwide.
[370:30.97]That's probably what's going on.
[370:32.47]Ooh, egg toast.
[370:33.15]Really?
[370:53.25]Come on, give me one more.
[370:54.87]One more so we can see it.
[370:56.23]Ah, come on.
[371:00.77]Do the anime voice.
[371:01.75]Nah, it's too late.
[371:06.04]Like two or three hours ago when I was like screaming, maybe I would have done it.
[371:10.50]Shit.
[371:25.30]Can I eat the chestnut?
[371:28.84]No.
[371:30.60]These things are stupid.
[371:31.84]Throw them away.
[371:37.03]Those things are expensive.
[371:40.47]Sandals?
[371:43.45]If you do the anime voice, I will use my sub.
[371:48.41]Ah.
[371:59.67]It's greed.
[372:01.31]No, I haven't done it yet.
[372:02.53]Have you noticed?
[372:05.61]I'm contemplating that right now.
[372:09.86]I'm thinking about it, but I haven't done it yet.
[372:23.91]He's doing pre-sellout.
[372:26.27]I haven't, no, I haven't done anything.
[372:34.30]Hold on, not yet.
[372:34.76]There's probably a chest back here.
[372:39.38]Give me another one of those things that I need.
[372:42.48]I need one more of those little snake things.
[372:45.56]They drop from the bees.
[372:46.57]Are you okay?
[373:04.42]Water shroom.
[373:11.04]Now get rid of the shroom.
[373:12.26]I need to open the chest.
[373:15.19]Ooh, what's that?
[373:17.43]It's an old muffler.
[373:18.99]It's even worse.
[373:19.55]Oh, look at this.
[373:22.75]Oh, look at this.
[373:25.53]Look at me.
[373:25.89]I can't emulate that.
[373:36.18]If you don't do it, I will be unhappy, but I will continue to watch the stream.
[373:40.47]Did I get it?
[373:41.01]I got it!
[373:41.75]I got it.
[373:42.09]Now I can craft that item.
[373:50.57]I don't know.
[373:55.88]I have to get an easy one.
[374:08.70]What did you drop?
[374:10.04]Unknown.
[374:16.16]Get rid of this other fucking shroom.
[374:33.25]What's that?
[374:34.37]What's this?
[374:38.87]Shit, there's too many cool things.
[374:41.71]Wooden shield.
[374:42.85]Stupid.
[374:43.43]Get rid of it.
[374:44.25]No, what's less than that?
[374:48.21]I have too much nice stuff.
[374:49.99]The muffler.
[374:50.47]Get rid of that.
[374:55.56]Honey.
[374:57.00]I'll buy a thousand dollars in bits if you do the voice.
[375:00.82]You're not gonna do that.
[375:01.62]I can guarantee that's not gonna happen.
[375:04.93]And I don't want you to do that.
[375:07.39]Let me save you some money.
[375:12.93]If I throw away the shield.
[375:16.23]Candy apple's worth it.
[375:21.80]No, I don't want to do that.
[375:23.00]Because now... Here's the thing.
[375:24.62]Now there's pressure on that person.
[375:27.14]If I do it... Oh, fuck.
[375:30.57]I didn't really want to do this.
[375:31.89]And you don't have to do it.
[375:32.59]And I don't want you to do it.
[375:42.65]Fine.
[375:43.43]Fine.
[375:44.23]Don't buy that money.
[375:48.21]Do not buy that money.
[375:52.79]There it is.
[375:54.53]I did it.
[375:54.95]It's done.
[375:55.41]Now you can move on.
[375:57.11]Done.
[375:57.87]Okay, that's it.
[376:00.09]We win.
[376:01.21]What do you mean, we win?
[376:09.52]I don't want a thousand dollars.
[376:10.40]Don't give it to me.
[376:24.38]We did it!
[376:25.20]Oh yeah, we did it, guys!
[376:26.29]We did it!
[376:30.37]Stream's over, I'm leaving.
[376:31.59]No!
[376:31.95]I'm telling you, I only did that just because nobody would ever stop.
[376:36.73]You know, you've been here for long enough.
[376:39.59]That would never stop.
[376:40.97]I would have to hear that every day.
[376:43.39]Like 10 streams from now.
[376:52.49]35 year old man pretends to be nine-year-old Japanese girl to pretend to to make 12 year old chat happy No I Mean that is kind of what happened, but you guys aren't 12 you guys are like 36 Which makes that even worse by the way I
[377:20.89]34 year old man pretends to be 9 year old to appease 25 to 30 plus year old chat.
[377:27.62]That's even worse.
[377:31.24]That's fucking weird.
[377:33.20]So... I'm 22.
[377:38.22]That's weird.
[377:38.62]I'm 19, 18, 19, 19, 26, 20, 25, 19, 19, 21.
[377:49.84]35-year-old man pretends to be 9-year-old to get $1,000.
[377:52.72]That's more accurate.
[377:57.98]But it's not accurate because I didn't get $1,000 and I do not want $1,000.
[377:59.70]Honey is $2,300.
[377:59.98]I had to do it.
[378:14.78]I had to do it.
[378:16.20]And you know I did.
[378:17.24]Sometimes the hardest choices require the strongest of wills.
[378:21.16]Imagine if his voice cracked in the fucking movie.
[378:23.16]People would have laughed.
[378:24.63]I need to open this.
[378:33.23]Get rid of the hat.
[378:34.17]Open the box.
[378:37.62]What is it?
[378:39.28]Chest piece.
[378:41.00]I'll take it.
[378:45.60]Now I'll do Elmo.
[378:46.98]I'll do Elmo for free.
[378:50.72]I love Elmo.
[378:51.80]I'll do Elmo for free.
[378:53.82]And he knocked it out of the park.
[378:57.96]He got both things done.
[379:19.69]And that's the way the stream ends.
[379:23.05]End of the stream voice.
[379:32.46]I could do the whole Elmo song right now.
[379:35.14]But I don't like it.
[379:36.48]After you do Elmo for more than three or four seconds, your brain starts to go... Shut up, Elmo.
[379:41.42]Your brain starts to say, I shouldn't be doing this any longer.
[379:44.99]After like ten seconds, it's like, it's probably time to stop doing this.
[379:52.10]I think that just gave me a nosebleed.
[379:54.36]No, it's alright.
[379:55.74]It's just a bloody booger.
[379:56.76]It's fine.
[380:01.79]Why do I hear the end music?
[380:15.43]Why is that on?
[380:16.09]I don't know.
[380:17.45]Ooh, treasure chest!
[380:26.06]Alright, let's craft some items.
[380:30.58]That's the cheapest thing I got.
[380:32.02]I need that, though.
[380:33.44]Crusaderbone, thanks for five community subs.
[380:36.18]Thank you.
[380:37.52]Appreciate it.
[380:45.49]Uh, probably the... The wooden shit.
[380:48.13]No, what do I get rid of here?
[380:51.45]Anti-venom +2.
[380:52.49]Where's the other anti-venom?
[380:53.87]I'm scared of one of them.
[380:59.27]Ooh, it's just a little pendant.
[381:01.17]Whatever.
[381:01.49]Is that cheaper than this?
[381:03.99]That's all we care about is money, so... Yeah, it's thrown away.
[381:12.98]You have a million anti-venom.
[381:17.72]Yeah, but I might need it for some kind of thing.
[381:20.12]Alright, we're good.
[381:21.48]Back to town, fusion, and money.
[381:25.11]Money.
[381:29.34]We can go to the pub.
[381:34.16]Fusion time.
[381:35.02]Here we go.
[381:37.34]Bracelet needs an iron armband.
[381:41.40]So let's get it.
[381:46.67]Iron armband.
[381:49.99]Fusion.
[381:52.91]So this is going to be a bracelet.
[381:53.97]Insect trap and an iron armband.
[382:00.39]Here's your thousand bits.
[382:01.43]Now squeal like an anime girl for my amusement.
[382:03.65]I was a thousand dollars, not a thousand bits.
[382:06.03]You're off by a little.
[382:16.18]What are we gonna get?
[382:18.64]Maiden's bracelet plus 11.
[382:19.84]Plus 11?
[382:20.26]1800 bucks?
[382:22.92]That's it?
[382:34.79]That's some bullshit.
[382:37.95]Oh, I need a cape!
[382:39.80]Cloth cape, I just need to buy one.
[382:43.78]Cloth cape, and then... There's something else I can make.
[382:48.64]Not the glove.
[382:50.36]Staff.
[382:51.04]Yeah, okay, I need two more bat wings.
[382:55.96]Alright, let me do the cloth robe.
[383:03.52]Which one was it?
[383:06.69]I don't remember.
[383:07.69]I don't remember.
[383:08.78]Which one was it?
[383:09.26]I don't remember.
[383:11.62]Cloth cape.
[383:12.82]I don't think I can buy that.
[383:13.62]Can I buy that here?
[383:18.48]I need cape.
[383:20.05]Cape.
[383:20.35]Do I have to buy it?
[383:23.69]I can't buy it.
[383:24.19]What?
[383:26.35]Market's closed.
[383:27.09]What about the pub?
[383:30.10]Looks like nobody's here.
[383:34.74]Uh, I think it's time for bed.
[383:36.26]Time to do the debt.
[383:37.26]I'm gonna go to the market.
[383:38.14]$80,000.
[383:40.64]Watch it be deleted from my bank account.
[383:42.94]Game sucks.
[383:43.26]Well done.
[384:06.01]Work hard next week.
[384:11.58]No, no, no.
[384:12.60]Itari, you already did it.
[384:14.30]I already made my money.
[384:18.40]Sinister objects are increasing in popularity with men.
[384:22.35]Chapel masters worried.
[384:24.71]Sinister items.
[384:30.47]What is a sinister item?
[384:34.47]2600 bucks.
[384:35.57]Plus 11.
[384:35.83]Alright.
[384:37.37]Uh, I need to buy the cape.
[384:44.04]Cape, cape, cape, cape, cape, cape, cape, cape, cape.
[384:46.20]Cloth cape!
[384:49.48]Fusion.
[384:53.18]Rank 1 cape.
[384:54.72]There it is!
[384:57.19]Boom.
[384:58.43]That's... Holy shit.
[385:00.21]Romantics Cape.
[385:03.45]$10,500.
[385:04.37]Cape with a daring, pleasing vine-like pattern.
[385:06.97]Just looking at it inspires longing in the heart.
[385:09.92]Its base price is $10,500.
[385:11.24]Alright, anything else?
[385:15.30]Town Square.
[385:17.24]Let's do an event.
[385:21.41]Sniff it.
[385:23.53]Hey, what's wrong?
[385:24.95]I dropped my hairpin.
[385:25.85]It's real important, too.
[385:27.49]Oh, don't cry.
[385:28.07]I'll help you find it.
[385:30.39]Yeah, just leave it to me.
[385:31.69]Despite how she may look, Tyr's a master at finding things.
[385:35.29]Pardon?
[385:36.49]She can get into every nook and cranny and find anything.
[385:39.62]Oh, really?
[385:40.10]Thank you.
[385:45.40]Glad we could find it.
[385:46.78]Thank you.
[385:50.50]Mymph.
[385:52.93]Wow, Tyr, you're black as coal.
[385:55.13]Why did it have to be in a drain of all places?
[385:58.27]Hey, you did great.
[385:58.95]And we can use you to warm the store now.
[386:01.64]No, you're going to take a shower because there's food in that store.
[386:04.36]I don't want you near my merchandise.
[386:07.30]Covered in shit.
[386:09.08]Wash goat to take a shower?
[386:11.78]Wash and sanitize your hands.
[386:18.79]Alright.
[386:20.29]How much do I... Oh, that's a lot of money.
[386:23.29]That's $200,000 in a week.
[386:28.39]I thought it was going to be like $160,000.
[386:33.59]Well.
[386:35.91]Should be an interesting scenario.
[386:39.47]Tomorrow.
[386:40.37]When we continue.
[386:41.84]I'm going to call it here.
[386:43.62]It's a perfect little time to stop.
[386:45.08]Six and a half hours.
[386:46.86]Will take us to about seven.
[386:49.99]I will see you guys tomorrow.
[386:51.37]We're just going to pick up right where we left off.
[386:53.07]I'm having a lot of fun with it.
[386:54.05]The game's a lot of fun.
[386:55.66]Game is saved.
[386:56.28]Game is good.
[386:58.80]So let's see if we can keep it going.
[387:03.00]I am safe.
[387:03.48]Turn.
[387:04.32]I'm not going to touch anything else yet.
[387:06.00]No.
[387:06.28]Safe.
[387:06.48]We're good.
[387:08.75]Yeah.
[387:09.07]621.
[387:09.09]That looks good.
[387:11.23]What time?
[387:11.67]Same time.
[387:13.09]Somewhere between like 3 o'clock Pacific.
[387:15.73]3 to 4 PM Pacific.
[387:18.71]Check your local listings.
[387:22.03]Did I miss the carnival stream?
[387:23.49]You did not.
[387:24.03]Don't worry.
[387:24.45]That's not going to happen for at least a month or two.
[387:25.85]So don't worry.
[387:33.30]I thought this was a House Flipper stream.
[387:37.32]He said by the end of the summer.
[387:40.04]Do you know what months the summer is?
[387:44.36]August, September?
[387:46.38]End of, like, middle of September?
[387:47.54]That's summer.
[387:54.13]September is not summer.
[387:59.03]The first and second week of September is still in summertime.
[388:13.08]It ends on September 23rd.
[388:15.06]I just want to make sure we're aware of this.
[388:18.37]Summer ends on Monday, September 23rd.
[388:21.75]We're in the Northern Hemisphere.
[388:22.79]That's where I live.
[388:26.77]anyways chat just got googled but all things considered there thank you everybody for watching uh by the way we didn't really touch much upon this I kind of just embarrassingly glazed over it I'm part of a porn ad so that's uh or a like a chat with your crush porn advertisement thing that's kind of interesting we didn't really touch the bonnet that much
[388:55.30]Wait, yeah, I know that people weren't here for this.
[388:56.80]This is really weird.
[388:59.18]They used a facecam of me in, like, a weird fucking, like, sidebar ad.
[389:06.01]I can't believe that's real.
[389:07.21]Is it actually real?
[389:16.59]Yeah, someone's gonna link it.
[389:22.88]I'm not going to show it on stream because I don't want to accidentally advertise a company that I not only have nothing to do with, but who have taken my likeness and put it somewhere that I did not give permission to.
[389:33.64]Hey guys, look at the website!
[389:44.14]Anyways.
[389:46.82]That is going to be the end of the stream.
[389:48.02]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[389:52.26]Let's do the bits.
[389:55.22]And subs, of course.
[389:56.02]Let's go back a little while ago here.
[389:58.80]We had... Demons V for the $25.
[390:01.48]Thank you, Demons.
[390:05.70]Actually, Demons V gave $32 here.
[390:07.94]And they say, thank you for the stream.
[390:11.26]I've had five operations this year and I'm in a lot of pain.
[390:14.60]And your stream helps distract me.
[390:20.26]I'm really sorry to hear that.
[390:25.25]Hopefully you have a swift recovery here, whatever you're going through, whatever you had to have done.
[390:34.60]But thank you so much for the 25 bucks.
[390:36.02]30 bucks, 32 bucks.
[390:38.06]And then they said, also please yell less and make fewer loud noises.
[390:50.35]Well, I may not have done that.
[390:55.58]That's your best quality.
[390:57.22]No, come on.
[391:00.60]Do I really have to go to bed tonight thinking that my best quality is loud noises?
[391:08.08]Imagine, like, you're in the shower.
[391:10.43]You shampoo and you're here.
[391:12.73]My best quality is loud noises.
[391:18.13]No, I'm more than that, right?
[391:25.57]Thank you, though, for the $32.
[391:29.03]Thank you, Jedi Master, for the $5.
[391:31.17]Somebody make a Death Grips remix with the Slice soundbite.
[391:33.89]You know the song.
[391:36.56]I'm not aware of the song, but whoever, I don't know.
[391:43.42]Thank you for the $5. $5.
[391:46.32]The best striped sweater.
[391:47.90]Thanks for the $10.
[391:48.34]Hey, Jerma, I couldn't watch your stream today, but I just wanted to drop it and say thank you.
[391:52.58]You're one of the most creative, funny, dedicated content creators I've come across, and I always count on your stream to lift my mood and turn my day around.
[391:58.96]You've helped me so much through some rough times recently, and I'm so grateful to have found your streams and YouTube videos.
[392:05.04]Thank you for all the laughs, and I hope you have a good stream and good rest of your night.
[392:10.64]Sorry you couldn't stick around today, but...
[392:14.88]You dropping in and giving me $10 and saying a ton of incredibly nice things about me.
[392:19.76]So... Thank you for that.
[392:23.20]And... I'm happy that you're happy here.
[392:30.08]Thank you so much for the $10.
[392:32.77]That was the best Stripe sweater.
[392:37.83]Glad to be around here.
[392:41.81]Do you plan on streaming CB?
[392:44.35]What is this?
[392:49.35]What is that?
[392:58.21]I didn't complete it.
[393:00.19]Cold brew.
[393:01.81]Do I plan on streaming me drinking a cold brew coffee?
[393:06.91]Yeah.
[393:08.09]I had a cold brew this morning.
[393:10.57]And it was delicious.
[393:18.43]Right off the fucking shield.
[393:19.65]Come on.
[393:19.95]You can do better than that.
[393:22.91]Thank you, Zake, for the 250.
[393:23.97]Hi, it's me, your kid's soccer coach.
[393:26.97]Really?
[393:27.27]What happened?
[393:27.93]Can you pick him up from practice?
[393:28.97]It's been days and he's really hungry.
[393:30.25]I know that you're really busy watching these Asian cartoons, but I'll have to contact Child Protective Services if you don't feed him.
[393:39.90]Thank you Smellyboy for the $2.50.
[393:40.96]The billion... The billion old man that has to be in the next Rumble.
[393:45.28]The billion dollar old man.
[393:48.10]The Twix brothers.
[393:53.30]Thank you DemonsV again for $5.00.
[393:54.92]Do the long tongue... To them.
[393:59.26]Do the long tongue to them?
[394:01.57]To what?
[394:03.53]How's the long... Like, go like... Stick your tongue out?
[394:14.58]In the porn, in the ad.
[394:15.92]I'm not doing an ad.
[394:25.13]No, no, no, no, no.
[394:26.51]Thank you for the $5 though.
[394:30.17]I'm not going to stick my tongue out on camera.
[394:33.80]You could give me $500 million and I wouldn't do it.
[394:38.78]Okay, I would do it for $500 million.
[394:41.12]Literally, every single person for the rest of my entire lineage would be taken care of for me to stick my fucking tongue out on camera.
[394:49.54]That's worth it.
[394:51.00]Worth it.
[394:55.41]Uh, thank you to OhMyGodTayon for the $250.
[394:59.23]A while ago you talked about sardines.
[395:01.93]I went out and got some and they were pretty meh.
[395:04.98]You got any other boomer food suggestions?
[395:07.00]Well, hold on a minute here.
[395:08.52]This is important.
[395:10.76]Did you get the boneless skinless sardines?
[395:14.06]By the way, there's only one brand you should be purchasing, and that's King Oscar.
[395:18.35]King Oscar boneless and seedless, boneless and skinless sardines in oil.
[395:26.36]Boneless and skinless sardines in oil.
[395:29.32]King Oscar.
[395:30.50]They come in a tin.
[395:31.26]You fold them back.
[395:33.26]Smash them up.
[395:34.12]Put them on a little bit of toast.
[395:36.31]Maybe add a little bit of mayonnaise to that or a tomato on top.
[395:39.63]You may have not eaten them correctly.
[395:49.81]King Oscar.
[395:50.61]They're the best.
[395:53.70]Look, I don't do sponsorships.
[395:54.96]I just tell you the truth of what I believe.
[395:59.90]King Oscar sardines are the best.
[396:03.04]Baskin-Robbins mom's cookies ice cream is the best.
[396:06.52]You don't have to pay me to say that.
[396:07.90]I'm telling you a fact.
[396:13.63]King Oscar doesn't have to come here and give me $1,000 to do an anime voice.
[396:19.09]I'm just going to speak facts.
[396:29.82]Why would he sponsor after 2,000 people just left anyway?
[396:33.30]Well, this is the end of the string.
[396:36.74]If I had a sponsorship, I would be probably required to do it at the peak of viewership.
[396:47.87]Anyways, sardines are really good.
[396:50.11]Another boomer food that you should try.
[396:51.45]Let me think about this.
[396:56.63]It's just food.
[396:57.29]It's not boomer food.
[397:00.53]Canned fish is really good for you, and it tastes good, as long as you do it right.
[397:04.33]Canned tuna, canned sardines, anchovies, they are good.
[397:09.47]If you can just get over it, how weird and strange and gross television has told you they are, you're going to enjoy them.
[397:24.06]Canned tuna is great.
[397:25.12]It is.
[397:31.02]Try pasta with, uh... Pasta casserole.
[397:36.21]Uh, what if, uh, pasta with tuna... No, tuna casserole.
[397:40.35]Pasta casserole.
[397:41.31]I'm a fucking idiot.
[397:42.55]Tuna casserole is a really good boomer food.
[397:47.50]Look it up.
[397:52.54]But thank you for the $2.50.
[397:54.84]Hope you can retry sardines when you get the right brand.
[397:58.98]Snoozencopter, thanks for the 250.
[398:00.04]Hey Jerma, I'm really looking forward to today's stream.
[398:01.86]I haven't checked what you're playing yet, mainly because I can always trust you to choose a fun game.
[398:05.64]And thanks to your no anime game policy, we don't have to watch stuff like that either.
[398:10.28]I'm so proud of you.
[398:11.66]That you never break your policy.
[398:13.88]That is what makes you so great and unique in my eyes.
[398:16.06]Jerma, you're the best.
[398:16.74]You never disappoint.
[398:17.80]Never.
[398:18.86]That said, I'm going to open the stream now.
[398:20.36]I'm really excited.
[398:21.24]You never fail us.
[398:23.72]When did I ever say a no anime game policy?
[398:30.14]I've never had a no anime game policy before.
[398:33.32]I said I watch one anime a year.
[398:35.38]This is not an anime.
[398:42.04]I did not say that.
[398:43.04]Somebody can go find that if they really want to.
[398:45.36]I never said there's a no anime game policy on this stream.
[398:55.36]Was that some way for me to deflect not having to play Doki Doki Literature Club?
[399:00.12]Because I got asked that every single day.
[399:02.95]Every moment of every stream.
[399:09.51]I think Play Doki Doki Literature Club may have been in this chat more than jermaMoon.
[399:16.97]Or more than half of my emotes.
[399:22.08]For a period there.
[399:23.92]I had to deflect it, somehow.
[399:26.68]You're an actual liar.
[399:30.39]I've already told everybody here that 90%, 80 to 90% of everything I say in this stream is not real.
[399:37.50]And I always clarify when things are real.
[399:39.42]Like, for instance, Baskin-Robbins ice cream is the best.
[399:44.28]That ice cream, Mom's Cookies, I said before, this is one of the 10% things that I say on stream that's real.
[399:49.75]And then I continue to say that.
[400:06.71]Sometimes it's too easy.
[400:09.20]Sometimes it's too easy, guys.
[400:10.32]Come on.
[400:12.78]But thank you, Snooze and Copter, for the $5.
[400:14.58]They say dot, dot, dot, dot after writing all that, so... I don't think they were, uh... They may have been a little disappointed.
[400:25.69]Chocolate fudge brownie is the best ice cream.
[400:27.93]Get wrecked, Jupiter Face.
[400:30.19]Let's ban this guy real quick.
[400:38.06]Oh, how do I turn off... Hold on.
[400:41.68]How do I... I actually just did that.
[400:49.08]What was his name?
[400:51.56]Did I even do the right person?
[400:57.88]How do you untime out somebody?
[401:03.76]Ah, there we go.
[401:04.32]There we go.
[401:04.64]I got it.
[401:15.68]They say, wow.
[401:21.42]You banned someone from pointing out the truth?
[401:27.83]I already unbanned him.
[401:29.41]I unbanned him.
[401:30.05]It wasn't even banned.
[401:30.99]It was a small timeout of 10 minutes.
[401:35.65]But if you're going to say something so, so awful...
[401:39.97]Like chocolate fudge brownies better than moms making cookies.
[401:43.07]I feel like you've gotta go.
[401:45.99]For at least enough for me to not have to look at it.
[401:59.20]Anyways, anyways, anyways.
[402:02.17]Thank you to Abomination Zero for the $5.
[402:05.27]Thank you for another great night, Jeremy.
[402:06.87]You've done so much for me and I'd really like to start streaming myself.
[402:09.75]Make it look like so much fun.
[402:11.37]How the hell do you do it?
[402:13.41]By having fun.
[402:14.81]It's important.
[402:18.05]If you cannot reliably enjoy yourself on stream, then it's kind of hard for other people too as well.
[402:32.23]Except when you play Mario Maker.
[402:35.75]That's one exception.
[402:38.89]But, good luck to you.
[402:46.50]I wish you the best.
[402:47.16]I've been watching since 2011, so you've been doing something right.
[403:01.60]I don't know, that's just up to you, though, you know?
[403:06.10]If you've been watching for that long, then I hope you do think I'm doing something right.
[403:10.81]I mean, there are probably plenty of people that have watched and come and gone, and that's fine, too.
[403:17.25]There may be people that have come to this channel and said, I don't really like this, and left.
[403:20.03]You kind of just have to find the community that speaks to you, you know?
[403:34.39]I don't really like this.
[403:35.37]No, I can't time that.
[403:43.02]I'm not going to do that again.
[403:47.16]This streamer only makes loud noises.
[403:50.96]It's been seven hours, okay?
[403:52.26]I probably made like 12 loud noises.
[403:54.66]So it was like 18 to 20 seconds of loud noises in seven hours.
[403:59.08]That is less than like a quarter of a percent of loud noise time on screen.
[404:03.54]So, come on.
[404:04.58]Give me a little bit of slack here.
[404:14.13]I'll wiki this.
[404:15.11]Thanks for the $15.
[404:17.59]At Jerma985, I'd like to buy one of your rings, please.
[404:22.02]I usually sell them for $1,500, so... Thank you for the $15.
[404:26.56]Thank you, thank you, thank you.
[404:32.17]One of my rings.
[404:32.85]LaCronda gave $35.
[404:35.73]No message, just $35.
[404:37.77]Thank you, LaCronda.
[404:43.26]Really appreciate that.
[404:44.60]It's a lot of money just to give.
[404:45.86]So thank you.
[404:49.22]I think that was when I did the, uh, Elmo anime thing.
[404:53.64]Combined them both.
[404:55.24]But thank you so much for the $35.
[404:56.18]It's a lot of money.
[405:00.36]Wave let thanks to the $420.
[405:03.90]Dijer Badesca.
[405:08.00]I think that's what I was trying to say.
[405:10.69]And then, oh my god, Teyon 250.
[405:12.63]Dijer Badesca.
[405:16.31]What does that mean?
[405:17.65]What does... What does it mean?
[405:25.87]It means goodnight, y'all.
[405:26.77]No.
[405:27.03]That's not what it means.
[405:28.20]It means are you okay?
[405:34.62]Okay.
[405:35.04]Alright.
[405:36.78]Are you okay?
[405:38.28]Are you okay?
[405:41.20]Crusaderbone gave five community subs.
[405:42.76]Let's make sure we
[405:45.10]touch on that.
[405:45.74]And also, speaking of subs, here comes the credits.
[405:48.74]By the way, there should be a new screen here and a couple of new things to listen to music-wise while Blordow continues to chip away at all the new stuff.
[405:57.71]I'll probably be implementing that over the next couple of streams.
[406:03.13]Might take a look into next week, but you should see it really soon.
[406:09.17]And the credits are going to roll right now.
[406:11.15]Thank you to everybody that subs to this channel.
[406:12.85]Thanks, everybody.
[406:14.32]All of you.
[406:18.88]It means a lot, everybody.
[406:22.24]And we are gonna have, unfortunately, there were a lot more subs than what you're seeing on the screen right now, but because the stream cut off in half two or three hours ago, I believe we may have lost the first two or three hours of people that had subscribed in the first couple hours.
[406:43.49]So I'm sorry to say that.
[406:46.11]Because technically a new stream had to start because... I'm not even sure that was a Cox thing.
[406:51.93]I think that was a Twitch thing.
[406:59.73]But regardless, thank you everybody for subbing.
[407:02.61]Doesn't water you.
[407:09.17]Old bits got deleted?
[407:10.83]No, they shouldn't.
[407:11.33]They're here.
[407:12.91]I got them here.
[407:18.95]They should be fine.
[407:20.65]Because I had this window open the whole time.
[407:26.72]Let me see.
[407:27.74]How long ago?
[407:28.32]Because I have all the bits here from five, six hours ago.
[407:33.34]Let me see.
[407:43.85]Unless they're up here.
[407:54.41]My message was like 10 minutes into the stream.
[407:59.11]I don't see it here.
[407:59.83]I don't see it here at all.
[408:12.55]Okay, let me check this one.
[408:30.23]The jermaMustard site.
[408:34.85]That's strange how it didn't go through though.
[408:38.49]Because everything else is here.
[408:39.51]Oh yeah, it looks like Solharv as well for 250.
[408:49.68]Thank you Solharv earlier.
[408:50.87]I guess the first couple of bits got cut off for some weird reason.
[409:02.01]Did you know and it's the first few bits here are talking about the porn joke a real screenshot from the Porn ad which I'm not going to show on stream, but thank you so hard Thank you origin.
[409:14.28]Hi Jerma.
[409:15.44]This bit is this donation is cursed after you finish reading this you'll be turned into an Eevee Still here
[409:25.72]Dan Manmi, thanks for the $4.
[409:27.06]Niall Arion, thanks for the $3.
[409:31.42]It's not a porn ad.
[409:32.18]It's just you having a conversation with a lovely lady that isn't Kim.
[409:36.66]Well, I didn't have that conversation.
[409:43.30]Tabarin, thanks for the $5.
[409:44.28]You never fail to make me smile and laugh.
[409:46.10]I love you.
[409:47.68]Thank you, Tabarin, for the $5.
[409:48.94]Thank you.
[409:55.83]Thank you, Manboy, for the 250.
[409:57.09]Not that I'm complaining, but I thought you didn't play anime games.
[409:59.88]I guess you really are a weeb.
[410:03.06]This is not even an anime game.
[410:04.60]I mean, it's an anim- It's- This is not like a TV show.
[410:08.24]It's an item capitalist store.
[410:11.85]It's a game that you make- Look, you could make the- You could make, like, Kermit the Frog and Big Bird, the two characters, and it's a- I would still play it.
[410:31.61]I don't even, like, care if it's, like, anime characters.
[410:35.49]I don't give a shit about all that.
[410:37.48]Is the game fun?
[410:38.92]And is there cool, fun concepts?
[410:46.38]The main characters squeeze every five... Alright, I'll turn off the squeeze.
[410:49.72]I'll turn it down.
[410:50.23]Thank you, Burger B, for the $10.
[410:55.35]Burger B, thank you.
[411:01.85]10 bucks from Burgaby.

[411:09.57]You got it.
[411:10.62]Thank you.
[411:14.66]Thank you, Vilemi, for the $30.
[411:18.78]Ah, yes, the wonders of capitalism, where an eight-year-old is pressed into indentured servitude to pay her father's debts.
[411:24.22]I hope you're happy, Jerma.
[411:28.48]It could be Big Bird and Kermit the Frog.
[411:33.95]And I'd still play it.
[411:34.77]And it could be Sesame Street teaches capitalism.
[411:39.97]And I'd play it.
[411:44.55]Thank you for the 30 bucks, though.
[411:48.53]Thank you, S10WUpdate, for the $2.50.

[412:22.55]Tonight we're going to be playing as a, whatever, who cares.
[412:25.31]And that's going to wrap up the video.
[412:26.45]Thank you all so much for watching.
[412:27.91]And of course, take care everybody.
[412:29.53]I don't think I made that video.
[412:32.25]But, that's fine.
[412:39.07]And then fast forwarding.
[412:42.68]Up here.
[412:44.26]We had...
[412:46.38]Uh, CluelessSniper for 250, can you do a bianime voice?
[412:50.78]There's no way that's gonna happen.
[412:52.18]I don't think I could.
[412:55.32]No, that's, uh, maybe tomorrow.
[412:57.48]Ask me again tomorrow.
[412:59.88]Thank you for the 250.
[413:01.78]Alicia, uh, AliciaiMusic, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[413:07.34]10 dollars from AliciaiMusic.
[413:10.87]Hey, Jerma was watching the Greenscreen Encore stream last week and it couldn't help but put some Jerma Easter eggs into a music video I made.
[413:17.40]You DO NOT need to watch the whole thing, but at 1 minute and 27 seconds you're driving in the bright window when it is centered, and at 1.57 you're climbing the tree on the right.
[413:28.57]And also there are brown notes.
[413:29.85]Why are there brown notes?
[413:38.32]Well, hold on.
[413:38.86]Here.
[413:39.60]Let's see.
[413:39.94]Here.
[413:40.50]Here's the video.
[413:44.48]Let's get this.
[413:45.10]Let's see if we can find this here.
[413:46.25]So I had 127.
[413:54.11]Hold on.
[414:04.99]That is not this person's song.
[414:07.89]That's still the Sesame Street music from the game.
[414:11.41]That's not their song.
[414:14.45]Somebody already had a Sour Fleece ready to go, and they're like, oh shit, wait, this is not the right one.
[414:23.05]I gotta hold.
[414:23.53]Let me mute this.
[414:28.38]Ow, fuck.
[414:32.40]This is not their song.
[414:40.25]Alright.
[414:40.45]Alright, get your sour pleases ready.
[414:53.38]So we're going to 127.
[414:53.96]That's not me, right?
[415:09.28]Alright, 127.
[415:09.56]Where is it? 127!
[415:51.73]How do you do frame by frame on YouTube?
[416:05.82]What?
[416:07.46]You're driving in the bright window.
[416:19.99]Where?
[416:20.69]Back?
[416:23.39]Hold on, get this on HD.
[416:26.31]It's a fucking 360p!
[416:40.60]I don't see anything.
[416:48.99]Enhance it.
[416:49.71]Is it right there?
[416:55.05]Is that me?
[416:59.03]Is that me?
[417:00.02]The person walking by?
[417:01.14]Is it this right here?
[417:05.96]That like weird ghost person?
[417:11.98]You missed it.
[417:13.04]That's not me?
[417:15.93]Where's the other one?
[417:18.77]157, you're climbing the tree.
[417:27.23]Center on the bright window.
[417:48.78]This is
[417:57.93]Alright, there I am.
[418:00.71]I thought it was bullshit for a minute.
[418:02.10]I'm like, what the hell is this?
[418:03.26]This is like a wild goose chase.
[418:04.50]Alright, and then again.
[418:06.22]Hold on, I gotta make this smaller.
[418:13.90]Why am I talking like I'm picking this up and it's heavy?
[418:18.38]Okay, and then at 157, you're climbing the tree.
[418:37.56]Where is it?
[418:37.92]I didn't see it.
[418:38.36]157.
[418:39.96]You're climbing the tree.
[418:41.32]156.
[418:41.34]156. 157.
[419:05.90]Climbing the tree.
[419:06.88]I don't see a tree.
[419:07.70]I should be climbing the tree on the right.
[419:34.45]Have we seen it?
[419:47.09]I don't see it.
[419:50.51]We're looking for a ghost.
[420:05.10]I don't see anything.
[420:33.88]Am I in there?
[420:40.17]Turn on the click map.
[420:42.05]It's not even on.
[420:43.03]Hold on.
[420:43.35]Let me get closer.
[420:49.65]Is that me in there?
[420:50.91]I think that's me.
[420:52.58]Yeah, that's me right there.
[420:53.90]I'm hanging on.
[420:57.46]The lengths that you went to, like, blend me into the tree.
[421:04.28]That's me, right?
[421:14.95]No?
[421:15.29]That's not me?
[421:16.47]Yes, it is.
[421:16.93]Alright, anyway, that was, uh, called Where's Waldo?
[421:25.56]Thank you, uh...
[421:26.86]Alice Eye, or Alicia Eye.
[421:31.84]If you'd like to do your own hunting, it's there.
[421:34.36]I liked it before.
[421:36.97]Check it out.
[421:39.09]And there's also a brown note, but I don't want to hear the brown note.
[421:41.19]I'm going to shit my pants.
[421:44.53]Okorolo, thanks for the $10, Okorolo.
[421:50.27]Thanks for always making me smile, Jeremy.
[421:52.31]I was diagnosed with depression earlier this year, so school has been tough.
[421:56.75]But despite these struggles, I can always rely on you to raise my spirits in a matter of the day.
[422:00.37]Sincerely, thank you for your dedication and your love.
[422:03.58]Jeremy Hart.
[422:04.46]Jeremy Hart.
[422:04.88]Jeremy Hart.
[422:08.56]I'm really sorry to hear that, Carollo.
[422:12.68]Keep pressing forward.
[422:15.20]Take care of yourself.
[422:17.72]And hopefully school gets better.
[422:25.14]Thank you for being part of this community.
[422:32.06]Hope things start looking up.
[422:33.78]Thank you so much for your $10.
[422:37.38]Join the Discord too.
[422:38.26]Tons of great people there if you haven't already.
[422:42.56]So we can shout the Discord out if we can.
[422:45.76]It's a great little spot.
[422:46.68]It's public.
[422:50.31]Thank you so much and take care of yourself.
[422:53.85]Thank you.
[422:55.75]We also had $10 from Nautilus.
[423:01.69]I accidentally put the dollar sign on the 1000 and I feel really bad, so here's 1000 bits anyway.
[423:14.55]I accidentally put the dollar sign on.
[423:16.37]What's that smell?
[423:29.29]Guilt bits.
[423:35.63]Well, it's plastic, right?
[423:37.61]Squeal vessel.
[423:39.81]No, thank you for the $10.
[423:41.71]Told you it wasn't necessary, but thank you for the 1,000 bits.
[423:45.81]Regardless, thank you.
[423:48.67]C4G, thanks for the $2.50.
[423:50.23]Big dip in smooth recovery.
[423:55.83]This is today.
[424:00.41]That's not a... That's not a... That's just simply a... That's a little, just small sell-off.
[424:05.91]Let's take a look.
[424:15.85]Let's get this on the screen.
[424:17.05]Alright, so what happened here?
[424:26.19]Let's see.
[424:27.95]First of all...
[424:30.28]What happened was, I can tell you exactly, this was, this was gamed.
[424:36.30]And I said it, I said out loud.
[424:39.50]Something about, like, everyone's gaming me and doing minus twos and then everybody just jumped on the bandwagon.
[424:48.68]And dumped the comedy stock down to zero.
[424:56.61]And then look at that immediate turnaround.
[424:59.77]You know, we call that in the industry, we call that a bear trap.
[425:02.51]So, sorry guys.
[425:11.24]Looks pretty rigged.
[425:12.20]That's a steady comedy level.
[425:27.72]Nice meme lines.
[425:28.86]I just want something to do, like, technical analysis to these charts.
[425:33.21]Somehow.
[425:35.65]I think that'd be really funny.
[425:38.57]Put a bunch of TA, like, technical analysis on what's gonna happen.
[425:46.00]But, no, that's fine.
[425:48.10]Thank you for that C4G.
[425:56.28]Freudian Weapon, thanks for the three bucks.
[425:57.58]Happy Saturday, jermaHeart.
[425:58.52]By the way, your Elmo anime voice was the highlight of my night.
[426:00.66]Have a good one.
[426:02.52]Thank you, Freudian.
[426:03.82]Thanks for the three bucks.
[426:05.34]You have a good one as well.
[426:07.22]You have a good one.
[426:09.58]Snoozercopter, thanks for the 250.
[426:10.44]Hey, you know I'm joking, right?
[426:12.48]I enjoy all your streams, especially when you're having fun or in a good mood.
[426:15.88]I got the pink bit badge now, by the way.
[426:19.85]How many bits is that?
[426:21.01]I don't know.
[426:21.91]It's okay if you call me snooze, by the way.
[426:25.00]We've known each other long enough.
[426:26.04]No need to be formal.
[426:33.04]No, I know you're just kidding.
[426:34.90]I was too.
[426:35.34]That's the thing about this stream.
[426:37.78]We can go back and forth and kid.
[426:40.58]We can just kid around.
[426:43.39]There's Orygian again for the 250.
[426:45.86]Talking about the cursed message.
[426:47.00]I'm going to be turned into an Eevee when I'm done saying this.
[426:53.22]And... What's it?
[426:56.75]Dragon cute?
[426:58.15]What's dragon cute mean?
[427:00.79]What is that?
[427:02.63]Dragon cute.
[427:03.29]Have fun.
[427:04.95]I don't know what that means.
[427:16.50]Why the fuck?
[427:17.54]Are you serious?
[427:22.95]Why?
[427:24.25]What is that?
[427:27.95]Audio warning for the first sound.
[427:30.11]What?
[427:30.39]It's supposed to be Eevee.
[427:38.47]It's supposed to be Eevee.
[427:47.32]What's this first fucking sound?
[427:51.83]Listen.
[427:55.31]What the fuck is that?
[428:02.39]That was so loud.
[428:03.24]I mean, I turned... My audio pumping through OBS is... Um...
[428:10.70]My audio pumping through OBS has dropped by 50% right now, so thank God it is because my head hurts.
[428:16.17]My, like, ears and head hurt right now.
[428:19.03]My ears hurt.
[428:23.17]I was wondering why it took so long for the thing to play.
[428:25.37]It takes, like, eight full seconds and then blows your ears out.
[428:31.42]Anyways, um, thank you for the $2.50.
[428:37.48]AppKey, thanks for the $3.00.
[428:39.93]Dr. Clay, thanks for the five bucks.
[428:42.45]I didn't see you, but I saw a face in a tree.
[428:49.66]I don't see it.
[428:52.58]I don't see it.
[429:01.52]Somebody just came in with a Vraid.
[429:02.62]Vraid!
[429:03.06]Thanks for the Vraid!
[429:06.41]Dave Raid just gave an extra... Dave!
[429:09.09]Dave... Dave Raid.
[429:11.45]Unfortunately, Dave.
[429:12.30]Thank you, Dave Cap, for the raid.
[429:15.26]But I'm literally about to turn the stream off.
[429:18.22]So hopefully you had fun on your stream, whatever it was.
[429:22.62]Thank you, Dave Cap, for the raid.
[429:23.80]Welcome, everybody.
[429:25.60]We're about to hit the pause button until tomorrow.
[429:31.09]But welcome, regardless.
[429:33.93]And have a great night.
[429:38.14]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[429:41.32]I see a... I want to see... Hold on.
[429:42.50]Let me zoom in here.
[429:44.20]I see like a weird Muppet face in the tree.
[429:47.26]I don't see... Me, though.
[429:59.03]I don't see me in here.
[430:04.10]Anyways, snooze.
[430:05.48]Thanks for the 250 right at the very end.
[430:08.12]I know you were kidding.
[430:08.92]And then he says, as if I wouldn't know.
[430:10.78]Actually, by the way, snoozing is better.
[430:12.20]Well, I just changed it.
[430:13.92]I just changed it.
[430:16.88]You were close, but we're not that close, okay?
[430:19.52]Have a good night.
[430:20.12]For real, I thought you... I just thought about how far you've come, and that's awesome.
[430:23.46]Thank you.
[430:25.04]Thank you, snoozing.
[430:28.98]Did he make the 80k or did we lose?
[430:30.68]Oh, I made the 80k.
[430:35.80]I made it just in time.
[430:37.86]The next leg is 200,000.
[430:38.87]We'll see if I can do it tomorrow.
[430:43.07]Take care, everybody.
[430:44.13]See you soon.
[430:44.99]Tomorrow around 3 to 4 p.m.
[430:46.19]Pacific.
[430:47.89]Much love to you.
[430:50.12]More receipt here coming up shortly.
[430:53.70]Have a great night.
[431:11.76]Thank you.
