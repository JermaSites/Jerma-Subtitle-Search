[00:42.76]Hey, I'm your host.
[00:46.14]I'm your host.
[00:48.30]I'm not gonna tell you what my name is, you already know it.
[00:50.86]Why would I need to tell you my name?
[00:51.80]Alright, sorry, I'm sorry.
[00:53.44]Hey guys.
[00:54.74]Hey guys!
[00:59.10]Alright, today we're gonna play, uh, Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk-Tuk
[01:06.21]It's apparently like Monster Hunter, but I'm not going to say that because I don't know.
[01:09.27]It just looks like a co-op fun boss battle game.
[01:13.09]We're going to have to go through a small tutorial, and then we'll get started.
[01:19.36]Yes, we're early today by one minute.
[01:22.16]When's the IRL mini golf stream?
[01:24.70]That's not a bad idea.
[01:28.78]That is not a bad idea.
[01:34.11]But, give me a minute.
[01:35.03]We're going to switch over to the game in two seconds.
[01:36.93]And we're going to bring Etalyx in.
[01:38.69]And... We'll discuss some stuff.
[01:42.74]Okay.
[01:43.26]I'll be right back.
[01:55.25]Okay.
[02:13.55]Go ahead and say hello, Etalyx.
[02:16.53]Uh, yes, hello.
[02:17.09]Hey, there he is.
[02:18.87]We finally patched him through.
[02:21.73]Was there a problem?
[02:22.61]I had to do, you know, like the old school 1920s operator video where the lady's like, like clicking in, like connecting.
[02:29.36]I just had to do that.
[02:30.28]It was a pain in the ass.
[02:34.20]I've got one of those thingies, too.
[02:35.56]Yeah.
[02:35.84]Right in front of me.
[02:36.56]Sucks.
[02:36.88]It's called Behringer.
[02:40.48]Does this game capture?
[02:41.84]I hope so.
[02:43.87]Let's find out.
[02:45.41]Hey, it does capture.
[02:47.15]Good.
[02:47.31]Just streamer things.
[02:48.35]Just streamer things.
[02:50.05]Can I stream this game?
[02:51.40]I've turned on my stream to potentially a thousand plus people.
[02:54.36]Let me just go through the first step to find out if this game works.
[02:59.30]I know, right?
[02:59.82]I'm so bad.
[03:01.94]I'm so bad.
[03:02.86]I'm so guilty of that.
[03:04.30]Ah, man.
[03:05.22]Alright.
[03:06.92]So those of you that have no idea what's going on, first of all, I didn't even make a tweet.
[03:09.54]Etalyx, like, tweet for me.
[03:11.21]Can you just, like, make a tweet for me?
[03:12.99]No.
[03:16.40]So I don't know much about this game.
[03:18.60]All I know is that this is kind of like, I guess, in the realm of Monster Hunter.
[03:23.62]That's my understanding, but as someone who hasn't played Monster Hunter, I'm not the expert here.
[03:28.91]Right, right, right.
[03:29.95]Well... It's gonna write monster game with friend.
[03:35.49]Why with friend?
[03:37.25]Why don't it just like tag you?
[03:39.88]Some guy, I mean, we just randomly selected some person from the chat and they're playing.
[03:46.50]Yeah, this is not a good, this is a random dude.
[03:52.39]Just write http://www.twitch.tv.com Do the http thing again.
[03:55.61]I could have been in fucking radio.
[04:09.17]Do the, uh... Watch this video.
[04:10.77]Don't hug me, I'm scared, HTTP thing again.
[04:12.92]Hey, you want a million dollar voice, guys?
[04:15.52]This voice would have costed a fucking million dollars.
[04:19.26]http://www.twitch.tv/.Jerma985 Million doll- ow!
[04:28.12]I, like, slapped my palm on my desk.
[04:29.76]That, like, fucking hurt.
[04:33.51]twitch.tv/.Jerma985
[04:39.16]How about the million-dollar question?
[04:40.98]What's the million-dollar question?
[04:42.36]How do you pronounce this game?
[04:44.74]I don't know.
[04:45.76]I'm gonna say Tukedan.
[04:49.00]I like Tukedan.
[04:50.20]Tukedan?
[04:51.18]Tukedan.
[04:51.80]Tukedan?
[04:52.77]Tukan Sam.
[04:53.41]No, I like Tukedan.
[04:56.09]Hey, thank you, Mr. Sandman, for the four dollars.
[04:58.87]Hi there, they say.
[04:59.59]Hi there.
[05:01.81]Alright, let's get this ball rolling here.
[05:03.43]I need to do, like, the tutorial first.
[05:05.45]And you said it's not bad.
[05:06.73]It's pretty good?
[05:07.76]It's pretty short.
[05:08.54]Okay.
[05:10.13]It'll probably take you longer to make your character than it will to go through the tutorial.
[05:13.84]Alright.
[05:15.14]So obviously my name's not going to be Slayer.
[05:18.68]What?
[05:18.88]You don't want to be like Slayer6969?
[05:20.52]No.
[05:20.64]I want to be like... Talcs, I need a good name for this.

[06:05.34]But there's only three faces.
[06:07.22]Wait, there are 90 hairstyles, but only three faces?

[06:15.76]Oh, I like this one.
[06:19.24]I don't know.
[06:20.61]I might have just changed my mind.
[06:24.09]Okay, how would you even move around with this?
[06:27.68]Don't you feel like you could just grab that and twist and it would just pull off?
[06:30.56]It's not even real.
[06:31.18]Okay, that one's kind of cool.
[06:36.09]I like that one.

[07:42.92]Did they spend the whole budget on making hair?
[07:49.03]How is this practical?
[07:51.57]Why did you give yourself angel wings on the front of your face?
[07:54.13]It's like in front of you, how do you see?
[07:55.25]You're supposed to be hunting monsters.

[10:00.06]He's actually angry, too.
[10:01.02]Okay, eyes.
[10:03.40]These are, like, all the exact same.
[10:12.80]Okay, I like these ones.
[10:14.18]Eye color.

[10:20.03]No, he's gonna have gray eyes.
[10:24.73]He's gonna have, like, frog eyes.
[10:31.92]Okay, this is fucking scary.
[10:36.94]This actually is kind of scary.
[10:41.58]It's that determined look.
[10:44.35]What does he look like?
[10:45.49]You can't stop this baby from doing anything that it wants to do.
[10:48.61]Does it look like me?
[10:51.51]It's starting to look like Frogman when you push the eyes that far apart.
[10:55.95]This better not look like me.
[10:57.17]Do I look like this?
[11:00.59]I look like this, don't I?
[11:03.85]Fuck.
[11:12.72]Character creators are so weird.
[11:14.10]Alright, Mo.
[11:21.36]Oh, jeez.
[11:23.46]I like this one.
[11:27.98]He's got a gray mouth.
[11:32.24]I need his mouth to blend in with the rest of his face.
[11:48.32]I don't want to team up with this guy.
[11:49.96]Alright, here we go.
[11:53.65]Accessories, mustache.
[11:55.57]Oh, no.
[11:56.29]No!

[12:04.77]Hey, can you move the facecam?
[12:09.17]No, no mustache.
[12:10.17]What about a beard?
[12:10.83]They got the Hitler stache too.

[12:27.30]What about accessory?
[12:28.22]Oh, God.
[12:29.82]Okay, I'm definitely gonna have the glasses.
[12:36.54]This guy is fucking scary.
[12:38.16]He is scaring me.
[12:40.50]You can switch what eye it's on.
[12:46.98]Oh, damn.
[12:47.54]These are perfect.
[12:52.77]This is like an old shitty librarian.
[12:56.77]Physique?
[13:00.72]Oh, you gotta be huge.
[13:05.59]How is that heavy?
[13:08.33]All that's doing is raising his shoulders and his thighs.
[13:11.21]It's all that muscle mass!
[13:13.87]Yeah, but he's supposed to be hefty.
[13:20.48]What about a large head?
[13:22.00]That old baby is so lean and live.
[13:25.06]I mean, if it is supposed to be... Okay, if I'm supposed to be a baby, then... Yeah.
[13:29.52]From the neck down, you look like a Naruto character.
[13:31.92]No, I want long legs.
[13:34.34]No, fuck that.
[13:35.80]We'll be in a huge baby.
[13:36.82]Okay, voice.
[13:42.02]Pitch.
[13:44.69]No.
[13:45.91]Okay, yeah.
[13:51.77]That's gonna get so annoying.
[13:54.77]I don't know if I can do that, guys.
[13:57.63]Don't think I can do that.
[14:05.18]God damn it, I have to do it.
[14:06.16]Alright, I'm getting close.
[14:08.56]First of all, gotta say thanks to some people.
[14:10.53]Thank you to Mer, Merman, Merman D3 for the 15 bucks.
[14:14.51]Hey, Jerma, I'm in bed with pain and with shingles, but being able to watch your stream helps a lot.
[14:20.05]Thanks.
[14:20.37]Damn, dude, shingles sucks.
[14:22.87]Is it with shingles?
[14:23.71]If I'm not crazy, shingles is chicken pox 2.0, right?
[14:30.52]I'm pretty sure that's what it is.
[14:32.32]But that's terrible dude.
[14:33.34]Hopefully you feel better.
[14:34.02]Hopefully you get some ointment and some cream and shit.
[14:35.96]And hopefully you feel better.
[14:39.78]But anyways, thank you.
[14:43.02]What's going on?
[14:44.60]Hmm?
[14:45.14]Oh, I just heard like a... I thought the video was about to play in the background.
[14:49.96]But thank you, Merman.
[14:50.92]Also, thank you SSBM Icarus for the five bucks.
[14:55.19]Holy shit.
[14:56.39]I can't breathe.
[14:57.15]What, because of the fucking baby?
[14:59.41]Thanks for the five dollars, dude.
[15:00.85]And then StixRenegade, of course Stix, we all know Stix, has given $20.
[15:04.51]Hmm, I'm suddenly craving donuts because I love Donuts 3.
[15:08.28]Gave $100.
[15:09.64]Interesting.
[15:10.60]Interesting stuff.
[15:11.14]Okay.
[15:13.27]uh so what I tell we I don't want to be the same as you so what well they say you can switch whenever you want uh god I started with uh whole cans but I'm probably gonna switch done that's it huge baby with a gun like do I have to actually sit here for any longer
[15:33.23]Settings is already done.
[15:33.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[15:35.17]By the way, Etalyx, please don't talk during the cutscene, because it's extremely important that you don't talk during the cutscene.
[15:41.27]These, like, 2008 cutscenes are treasures.
[15:45.81]Here it comes.
[15:46.19]Here comes the cutscene.
[15:46.95]Do not talk during it.
[15:48.90]Okay.
[15:52.50]I mean it. ...
[16:05.00]I fucking skipped it.
[16:07.04]I couldn't take it anymore.
[16:08.42]Alright, how do I use the gun?
[16:12.18]This is actually kind of cool.
[16:16.44]I'm so glad I used the gun.
[16:19.10]That's reload, okay.
[16:20.02]Why does it say seven?
[16:24.26]I haven't figured that out yet.
[16:25.10]Are you talking about the abilities at the bottom right?
[16:26.82]Yeah.
[16:28.40]I can charge this up.
[16:31.42]Ooh.
[16:32.68]Cool.
[16:33.56]Okay, I gotta like, how do I stand back up?
[16:36.98]Okay.
[16:38.27]Is it like a Dark Souls role?
[16:39.65]Okay, there we go.
[16:43.25]Attack one, attack two special move.
[16:44.75]Okay, my attack two is just reload.
[16:54.61]I have to manually do this.
[16:57.42]I have to manually reload the gun, each individual bullet.
[17:00.68]Oh, that sucks.
[17:03.08]So you gotta purify these things?
[17:08.24]What, do you just tap the reload button eight times in a row?
[17:11.18]Yeah.
[17:12.57]Okay, the ritual of purification is what you're talking about, right?
[17:15.71]Yeah.
[17:16.69]You kill them, they turn into smoke monsters, so you have to run up to them and hold right bumper.
[17:23.21]I'm doing that.
[17:26.31]Hold RB.
[17:26.77]That's what I'm doing.
[17:28.69]Right bumper.
[17:30.15]He's just shooting the gun.
[17:36.28]Your right bumper shoots the gun?
[17:37.80]My right bumper is shooting a gun.
[17:40.66]That is not the ritual of purification.
[17:43.00]Well, the smoke is gone.
[17:44.24]Are you sure you're holding down the bumper?
[17:49.88]Yeah, I am.
[17:50.60]RB.
[17:52.46]RB is also shoot gun.
[17:56.19]Okay.
[17:56.57]There's different bullets!
[17:59.01]What are these?
[18:00.21]Wow, okay, hold on.
[18:02.53]What's happening?
[18:07.05]Okay, I gotta learn, I gotta figure.
[18:08.41]Okay, there's a giant weird enemy here.
[18:15.55]Now I am doing it.
[18:16.67]Yeah, well you were probably like aiming down your sights when you were trying to do it the first time.
[18:20.82]I don't think so.
[18:22.20]Does it default aim or do you have to hold left trigger?
[18:26.46]Hold on, there's like skills and shit here.
[18:28.22]Hold on.
[18:29.06]Steal health, all protection, restore health.
[18:33.99]R, B, and X. Alright.
[18:41.30]This is much more complicated than I initially imagined.
[18:46.40]I hope you memorize that information, by the way, because it will never show back up again.
[18:49.76]It's never going to show up again.
[18:50.84]I got to reload.
[18:53.99]Restore health.
[18:54.83]Okay.
[18:56.45]SNP, ABS.
[18:57.95]I don't know what these all mean.
[18:58.79]I'm sure we're going to find out.
[19:00.87]It's okay.
[19:01.13]I don't know either.
[19:05.67]Is this health somewhere?
[19:08.74]Alright, let's do like RBA.
[19:12.14]What the fuck is that on a PlayStation 4 controller?
[19:16.08]Oh, you're playing with the PS4 controller.
[19:17.42]Yeah, I'm playing with the PS4.
[19:18.86]That explains some things.
[19:23.91]Okay, you actually really have to hold it for a while before it pops up.
[19:27.99]Okay.
[19:31.58]Are you getting beat by the tutorial mini-boss?
[19:33.44]I'm trying to learn how to shoot the gun.
[19:35.26]I don't know about you, dude, but the gun is a little complicated.
[19:41.57]What does SNP mean?
[19:45.21]Sneaky peep.
[19:47.27]Maybe.
[19:50.42]I'm shooting him in these spots.
[19:56.52]Does he have health?
[19:59.54]Yeah, I think if you hit right thumbstick some kind of weird eye goggle vision comes up and a health bar appears Oh, oh god.
[20:07.22]He's like okay.
[20:07.76]He's like dead Gonna end it with a headshot No I'm not So why would you ever like get out of this mode?
[20:18.66]Because it's ugly.
[20:19.76]It's just ugly?
[20:20.34]Is that like the reason?
[20:21.61]I don't know maybe it's limited time I don't really know why it turns the world blue
[20:30.13]Did I get him?
[20:30.99]Ritual of Purification.
[20:32.47]Got him.
[20:33.21]Hardened Oni-Bone?
[20:35.13]Hardened Oni-Bum?
[20:36.23]What?
[20:36.33]An Oni-Bone.
[20:37.09]Is there a sprint?
[20:37.90]Of course there is.
[20:38.94]Let me reload the gun.
[20:40.68]SCT... I guess these are different, like, defenses or something?
[20:59.94]I guess?
[21:00.52]I don't know.
[21:01.36]Why the hell am I shooting like this?
[21:04.46]He has like a purple health bar.
[21:06.73]I'm not sure if that means anything.
[21:08.55]Your guess is as good as mine.
[21:10.51]Did you have like different like colored shit?
[21:26.40]uh no because I'm stuck on the ground and I can't even jump that high so I think that's just weak spots for you to aim at I guess because I mean I know I have like different like bullet types sct is shotgun mode scattergun the snp would be what sniper and abs is just ability or something
[21:52.59]Sniper.
[21:53.13]Abs.
[21:54.03]Abs.
[21:54.31]It works out your abs when you press it.
[21:58.24]I think I did it.
[22:03.06]I believe I'm getting to the end of the tutorial.
[22:06.47]I'm currently trying to figure out how to switch weapons.
[22:08.13]ABS is absorb, apparently.
[22:12.70]Seems kind of cool.
[22:16.42]It ran away.
[22:16.98]I don't want to talk about any of these people.
[22:19.66]Anti-lock brake system.
[22:27.77]I, like, use it and my character just stops.
[22:30.07]How many of them?
[22:30.93]What about the Simula?
[22:32.69]Who cares?
[22:34.14]This is all about getting to the tutorial.
[22:37.14]Cutscene, quiet.
[22:37.48]Whoa.
[22:57.32]There's snakes out there this big?
[23:02.38]What?
[23:04.08]There's snakes out there this big?
[23:05.70]What is that from?
[23:09.52]Uh, you're asking me?
[23:10.40]Yeah.
[23:12.66]Come on.
[23:13.58]Is this, uh, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on, hang on.
[23:17.02]It's a worm movie, right?
[23:18.10]Nope.
[23:22.64]I don't know, what is it?
[23:24.28]Come on.
[23:25.26]Anaconda.
[23:27.16]Oh, yeah.
[23:28.80]I was thinking it was like a trimmer's joke or something.
[23:30.78]No, it's the snake's out there this big.
[23:33.17]Like one of the worms comes up.
[23:34.61]He's like, there's snakes out there this big?
[23:36.29]Yeah.
[23:40.83]The snake from the wall.
[23:41.53]Anaconda sucked.
[23:42.97]Wait a minute.
[23:43.91]Hold on.
[23:44.13]Who's this funny character?
[23:46.74]Black mage.
[23:47.50]I'm going home.
[23:54.03]Going back, you have to carry our guest.
[23:55.72]What do you think the first monster we're going to kill is?
[24:05.08]Probably going to be like a giant rat.
[24:07.04]You think so?
[24:08.95]I'm going to say it's going to be a T-Rex lookalike.
[24:15.79]They do love their dinosaurs in these type of games, don't they?
[24:19.86]Dinosaur mimics.
[24:20.90]Alright, when you get out of the tutorial, tell me how to get into the inventory, because I don't know.
[24:24.82]How do you get in the inventory?
[24:28.02]How do I get in the inventory?
[24:33.77]It's not a joke, I don't know.
[24:34.97]Apparently I have all these weapons.
[24:39.81]No.
[24:43.49]Okay, you know how you get in the inventory?
[24:46.64]Uh, how?
[24:47.16]Go talk to the random suit of armor that's sitting on your, like, stove.
[24:55.63]Ugh, got stuck in a cutscene.
[24:57.21]Oh shit, I walked out and got in a cutscene too.
[25:00.33]I think we can- we can play now together.
[25:03.59]Activate weed vision?
[25:10.69]Activate weed vision.
[25:13.73]Oh, God.
[25:15.77]Hey, Anost.
[25:17.30]Thank you, Anost, for the 50 bucks.
[25:20.22]Will the next Jerma live action rumble take place on a United Airlines flight?
[25:25.48]Uh, no.
[25:26.40]Ha, funny jokes.
[25:27.38]No, it will not.
[25:32.13]We all know Jerma doesn't take sponsorship.
[25:33.79]Hey, but we all know, like, just fly JetBlue.
[25:36.29]You know what I'm saying?
[25:36.95]Like, fucking get on a JetBlue plane.
[25:40.79]What are you doing flying United?
[25:42.09]Get on JetBlue.
[25:43.71]Are you crazy?
[25:45.41]Alright, let me change some equipment here.
[25:46.89]I don't think I want the gun.
[25:50.37]The number next to a weapon or piece of armor detonates its class.
[25:53.90]Max of 9.
[25:54.56]Some equipment may eventually surpass higher class items after multiple fortifications.
[26:01.24]So what weapon are you going to pick?
[26:02.40]And I'll pick something different.
[26:03.60]Well, I just got a rare.
[26:05.96]Right?
[26:06.18]Didn't I?
[26:06.48]Whoa!
[26:07.46]From a booster?
[26:08.18]Didn't I get the club or something?
[26:10.70]What was it called?
[26:13.21]you've got one of every default weapon yeah but didn't I just get what was that like something else probably armor if I had to guess I don't see it anywhere what the hell is it it was like a bone axe great chain merciless gauntlets long spear dual knives long sword what the hell
[26:38.22]Was it that thing at the bottom?
[26:40.39]I don't think so.
[26:42.63]I mean, I have the... Apparently there's a guy that's now with me.
[26:51.03]Attack up.
[26:52.38]Attack and Oni.
[26:53.18]Alright, we're gonna have to figure this shit out somehow.
[26:57.54]Let me see something.
[27:00.22]Register equipment.
[27:02.80]Do I have to, like, log in to, like, an old website?
[27:08.94]It sets, okay.
[27:11.82]Things with false accusations in the chat right now.
[27:13.78]Change appearance?
[27:15.54]No.
[27:16.50]Okay.
[27:17.97]Well, Etalyx.
[27:19.23]We'll just get in the same lobby and figure this out.
[27:22.55]So, we have to talk to the person behind... Where's the portal?
[27:29.95]Wait, what's the false accusation?
[27:31.07]What happened?
[27:32.89]I took care of it.
[27:33.43]It's taken care of.
[27:34.01]It's taken care of.
[27:36.29]Let me just go through this part.
[27:39.96]Let me talk to the skunk lady.
[27:41.42]Alright, what weapon did you pick?
[27:43.39]I'm just going to stay with the gun for now.
[27:45.67]I'm not going to learn something else.
[27:50.55]Mine didn't seem nearly as complicated as yours.
[27:52.50]That's alright.
[27:54.50]This is a tea house.
[27:56.72]I picked a baby weapon.
[27:57.96]I'm very happy to meet you, Keaton.
[28:01.06]Alright.
[28:01.42]We got another cutscene.
[28:04.56]Alright, where are we supposed to go to play cooperative?
[28:07.88]Through a gate or something.
[28:11.44]There's a person behind a desk.
[28:13.85]Alright.
[28:17.37]Go to the Steam community discussion, and it's on the front page.
[28:21.37]There's a guy behind a desk.
[28:23.11]I'm going to cover the situation that you are in, okay?
[28:31.64]I got a quest for you.
[28:32.86]Uncover the situation that you are in.
[28:36.62]What?
[28:36.84]That's apparently the quest.
[28:40.44]Uh, so the guy behind the desk says we aren't ready for you yet.
[28:45.00]Unless there's a different guy behind the desk.
[28:47.18]Is there a different guy behind desk?
[28:49.52]I'm gonna look it up.
[28:51.86]Just stream everything.
[28:52.86]Alright, well I'm just gonna keep going.
[28:55.32]I'm just gonna continue the tutorial quest.
[29:00.34]That's Baby Keaton.
[29:05.87]Alright.
[29:10.45]Quest unlocked.
[29:11.23]Figure shit out.
[29:12.01]I know, really.
[29:16.54]But also, thank you, Gummy Monk, for the five dollars.
[29:18.18]The gear probably won't matter.
[29:19.12]Just go hit stuff.
[29:19.82]Yeah, that's true.
[29:20.94]I'm the professor.
[29:21.56]Why is everybody so small?
[29:22.88]Oh, wait a minute.
[29:23.36]No, my guy's huge.
[29:34.45]Yeah, meet the professor and listen to her life story.
[29:39.25]Strange, strange.
[29:42.22]Yeah.
[29:42.48]Does use a stone near the exit play online?
[29:44.46]Use the stone.
[29:45.02]So we get a summoning stone?
[30:00.32]Can I stop having tea with this lady?
[30:06.58]It unlocks right after you do the shop tour in town.
[30:10.69]I think I'm doing that right now.
[30:12.51]Oh.
[30:14.03]Did you meet the professor?
[30:17.03]No, I'm about to, though.
[30:20.97]Harry, I'd like for you to meet Professor Horace Slughorn.
[30:28.55]Unfortunately for you, you're gonna be Professor Horace Sloan.
[30:32.32]Alright, go watch the trailer for... Which one was that?
[30:37.51]It sounds like Order of the Phoenix or somewhere around there.
[30:39.49]Was that Order of the Phoenix?
[30:40.61]Whatever one where he's explaining to Harry in the trailer that he's going to meet Horace Slughorn.
[30:46.37]It's two audiophiles spliced.
[30:48.75]For summaries, don't fucking ask me why.
[30:51.29]He says, he's like, Harry, oh yes, I'd like for you to meet Professor Horace Slughorn.
[30:57.33]It's very, very, very evident.
[30:58.71]You can hear it.
[31:00.01]I don't know why they had to splice that together like that terribly, but that's what happens.
[31:04.87]The word professor is a different audio clip that they took from somewhere else.
[31:08.11]Don't know why.
[31:10.98]Professor Horace Slughorn.
[31:15.68]No, there's an oni attack.
[31:22.08]Of course you're a slayer.
[31:25.48]You can have a demon hand too, a device of my own creation.
[31:27.92]A demon hand?
[31:28.38]What's that?
[31:29.12]A new machinima.
[31:30.68]A new machinima respawn.
[31:31.95]I just completed.
[31:32.71]Put out your hands, both of you, and I'll put it for you.
[31:34.59]Is there any way to skip the dialog or do you just hit A as fast as you can?
[31:38.77]You just gotta hit A.
[31:43.89]Was it Half-Blood Prince?
[31:46.35]May have been.
[31:48.84]She was not laughing as hard as the text implied.
[31:51.82]Alright, I'm on that quest too.
[31:55.94]Good.
[32:09.03]Don't worry guys, it'll only take us like another four hours before we can play together.
[32:12.45]I'm having Far Cry flashbacks.
[32:14.51]And how are we going to take care of this?
[32:16.67]We're going to skip that cutscene.
[32:21.28]Here we go.
[32:22.38]Defense.
[32:22.72]Defense.
[32:22.98]Okay, so this is sniper mode.
[32:24.78]Can I zoom in?
[32:25.74]No, I can turn on weed vision.
[32:26.98]Okay.
[32:34.35]I get it.
[32:34.69]So I can't be in... I understand.
[32:39.09]I understand.
[32:39.55]Developing boosts.
[32:40.51]What on Earth does that mean?
[32:54.83]Activate Demon's Hand.
[32:56.91]Alright.
[32:59.78]What?
[33:00.00]What the hell is that?
[33:02.32]I don't know what it does.
[33:04.30]I don't really know what it does, but it does something.
[33:07.20]It looks kind of cool.
[33:08.02]Watch out for these fucking chokits.
[33:11.38]I can't wait till you and I can play together so we can just have so much fun.
[33:17.82]I got to be inside the circle.
[33:21.36]I know!
[33:22.01]That's the annoying part.
[33:24.23]I don't understand why that is the design decision.
[33:27.65]It's okay, Tupi.
[33:31.43]Oh, yeah, wait.
[33:31.83]Hey, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[33:32.97]I hear a fucking little taquito in the background.
[33:35.77]There is a little taquito in the background.
[33:39.23]What the fuck was that?
[33:42.27]Well, I missed.
[33:43.79]Midas, please.
[33:44.27]No, that's not auto.
[33:44.95]That's Midas.
[33:45.65]Next comes something a little bigger.
[33:47.77]Here we go.
[33:48.09]Oh, no.
[34:01.98]Oh look, a new character.
[34:03.20]This person has a giant lance.
[34:05.30]We're not gonna have to deal with like four NPCs running around at all times, are we?
[34:12.67]I hate that shit in games.
[34:14.70]Don't make me have to run around with like three dickhead NPCs.
[34:19.25]What does he got?
[34:20.55]Let's get some new bullets in here.
[34:21.93]What do you guys say?
[34:22.73]Oh, let's get this.
[34:23.61]Okay, let's put on... Okay, EXP.
[34:25.07]What?
[34:25.69]I have a different gun?
[34:26.55]What?
[34:26.87]I don't understand.
[34:28.35]EXP.
[34:28.47]Don't ask me.
[34:48.06]experience points or something.
[34:53.64]Do you have to hit them?
[34:54.98]Parry and attack.
[34:57.32]Oh, I am on that screen at the exact same moment you are.
[34:59.59]Oh, really?
[35:00.03]Okay, a Demon Hand technique that channels the massive strength of an Oni and uses it to elude the Oni and pull it down.
[35:07.33]When the Demon Hand reaches full strength, it slams into the... What the fuck are you talking about, game?
[35:13.65]Parry and attack.
[35:18.31]They know in most games when they want to teach you how to parry, they give you an opportunity to parry, and they don't move on with the game until you've nailed it.
[35:24.93]Yeah, that's true.
[35:25.65]In this game, it's just like, here's how to parry.
[35:27.87]In this game, they don't give a fuck.
[35:30.94]I still have no idea how to parry.
[35:33.56]Oh, we gotta cleanse this.
[35:34.64]Alright, I got the Fujiwara no Hidousata.
[35:38.08]What would that be?
[35:40.10]Alright, cool.
[35:42.48]Uh-oh.
[35:43.57]His soul came out and got angry at us.
[35:49.17]Oh, Midas made Otto look around?
[35:50.56]That's so funny.
[35:55.78]You're not laughing that hard.
[35:56.64]Stop lying to me!
[35:58.40]Alright, now we're at the point now where I'm just fucking mashing buttons.
[36:03.63]We gotta go.
[36:04.15]We gotta get this going.
[36:07.83]You're the main reason why I went where you went to PAX.
[36:11.15]I remember meeting you at PAX You still the Scout poster that yeah that I signed so that's fucking awesome Hey Devin the magic dog, thank you for the five dollars.
[36:19.57]They aren't small.
[36:20.61]They're compact.
[36:21.53]No that guy is small.
[36:24.73]That guy's tiny
[36:33.84]Tell me your name.
[36:35.22]Hey, you want to play Binding of Isaac Daily Challenges and we'll just wait for each other to get to the next room at the same time?
[36:41.90]Oh, you're MLC Stealth?
[36:42.92]Remember MLC Stealth wanted us to use the same seed and do it, play like four at the same time?
[36:48.91]100% serious, too.
[36:50.69]That was not a joke.
[36:51.57]No, he really wanted us to do it.
[36:53.13]And we never did it.
[36:53.77]We never humored him one time.
[36:55.97]Not even one time.
[36:58.79]Hey, are you guys through?
[37:00.16]You ready to fight the boss?
[37:00.86]You ready to fight mom?
[37:02.36]So I can't skip this cutscene.
[37:03.79]This must mean it's the last cutscene.
[37:06.41]Did you push start?
[37:07.57]I did.
[37:10.09]No, we're just in here.
[37:16.00]The amount of text makes me think I'm at the introduction of a new MMO.
[37:22.54]Just give me the fucking quest.
[37:33.77]Look at how impatient we've become as people.
[37:35.89]Think about this.
[37:38.26]Look at how impatient we are yeah, but there's patience and then there's this
[37:45.90]I remember when, like, back in the day, I used to want to read all this.
[37:49.61]I just don't care anymore.
[37:51.01]This is not a story-based game, though.
[37:53.25]This is not like Final Fantasy.
[37:54.75]This is like the game you buy because you want to go kill big monsters.
[37:57.51]Yeah, this is not like... Who cares about this story?
[38:01.77]I don't think anyone does.
[38:04.94]I can't imagine somebody coming up to me and being like, Hey, well, the storyline in Takedon is like... Seriously, I fucking... I loved every second of it.
[38:14.96]My favorite character is Tokitsugugu.
[38:21.51]Okay, my relations, I've gotten... I just joined the Machinima Respawn family.
[38:27.16]Welcome to my Machinima.
[38:28.42]I'm now a Machinima partner.
[38:34.39]I mean, to be honest, you're skipping through every cutscene in dialog.
[38:38.25]FYI, there's like one... After they're done, pretty much, they give you one screen.
[38:43.17]You're supposed to choose one of four things.
[38:45.07]I was hitting A so fast.
[38:46.26]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[38:46.98]What do you mean we have to choose one of four things?
[38:49.28]I don't know.
[38:49.78]I have no idea.
[38:51.48]There was the final screen in the dialog chain.
[38:54.82]I clicked A and I heard it go... And, like, I acquired.
[38:58.54]I have its inventory.
[38:59.43]I don't know what it was.
[39:01.65]I gotta be careful I don't do that, then.
[39:04.37]You have to push A a lot more though.
[39:06.33]I do?
[39:08.17]How much more?
[39:09.75]A pretty good amount.
[39:10.75]A pretty good amount?
[39:12.26]Don't tell me that and I'm gonna accidentally pick like the fucking ending cutscene.
[39:15.88]It's a pretty good amount.
[39:21.55]I told you!
[39:22.45]You said it was a pretty good amount!
[39:24.39]It was decent!
[39:25.31]No, shit!
[39:26.57]Hey, you also gotta remember, I'm looking at what you're doing 45 seconds past.
[39:32.44]I thought it was gonna be, like, way more than that.
[39:35.60]What the fuck?
[39:37.10]From where I was looking, it was a pretty good amount.
[39:39.98]You had just finished the cutscene.
[39:41.34]Well, what did I just get?
[39:43.08]I don't know.
[39:43.86]Oh, God damn it.
[39:45.20]Look at what we've done.
[39:46.68]Do we have no patience?
[39:47.42]Whatever it is, we both have it.
[39:49.50]Whatever it is.
[39:50.44]Okay, shield, taunt, barrier, recovery.
[39:52.36]I don't want that.
[39:55.53]Did I get anything new?
[39:58.43]Unbelievable, dude.
[39:59.47]Like, what the fuck?
[40:00.29]I don't even know what that was.
[40:03.73]Okay, can I come get you now?
[40:06.03]Yeah, I hope so.
[40:08.75]I'm looking.
[40:09.77]I don't see anything in my inventory.
[40:13.71]Alright, so have you figured out where the people are?
[40:18.47]What about Captain Jack Sparrow?
[40:20.15]What about Captain Clown Jack Sparrow?
[40:22.82]What does he know?
[40:26.30]Okay, I think I found it.
[40:31.00]Maybe.
[40:32.30]Restart the deterrent.
[40:33.26]It's like up past the big gate, right?
[40:37.75]Person behind the desk wants to talk to me.
[40:41.51]Which desk?
[40:43.25]The main one.
[40:44.57]It's to the north?
[40:47.14]North.
[40:48.38]You got it.
[40:50.94]It was just a screen that explained things you can access from your home.
[40:53.74]Okay, that's good.
[40:55.50]To the west.
[40:56.86]To the west.
[40:58.44]Should I pick up all these quests or no?
[41:01.41]I'm gonna say no, and let's just try to figure out how to do this.
[41:04.19]Should I get in a fight with Clown Jack Sparrow?
[41:09.71]Okay, I see the giant portal.
[41:13.43]That looks like a giant portal to me, but where is it?
[41:17.99]The portal stone thing?
[41:19.26]That's where I'm at, but I don't know how to use it.
[41:21.46]Oh, there it is.
[41:22.76]These are stone pillars that let you warp through space.
[41:24.82]You can freely move to any location containing a portal stone that you have visited before.
[41:29.51]Jump to other headquarters.
[41:30.53]Jump to other portal stone.
[41:31.77]Alright, other headquarters.
[41:33.21]Play... I got it.
[41:35.07]This is the Slayer's headquarters when playing multiplayer games.
[41:37.41]You can play with players that are in the same lobby, or you can play on your own.
[41:40.11]The type of connection is shown in the upper right-hand corner of the screen.
[41:42.53]Play online, play alone.
[41:44.67]Play online.
[41:46.33]Where is this?
[41:46.85]Okay, I'm gonna... So go talk to the fucking egg.
[41:50.13]Hold on.
[41:51.69]Yeah, I did that.
[41:53.44]Whoops.
[41:54.34]Okay, you talk to the egg.
[41:55.10]Okay, hold on.
[42:01.31]Okay, uh, I'm gonna create a lobby.
[42:03.64]You just go to search lobby.
[42:07.78]Am I at the wrong egg?
[42:09.34]What egg are you at?
[42:09.92]I'm at the portal stone.
[42:12.26]The name of the room is Room 26.
[42:14.28]Alright, inviting one person.
[42:20.56]Search for zero people.
[42:24.05]Is there no Steam overlay in this game?
[42:25.51]This password is a fucking mess.
[42:27.23]Can I change this?
[42:29.23]I don't think I can change this password.
[42:32.52]No, I can't.
[42:33.10]It's a series of fucking numbers.
[42:34.53]I have to, like, give this to you.
[42:36.73]I can't even define where you get in the lobby.
[42:42.35]Restrictions.
[42:42.99]So, okay.
[42:44.05]Select the lower phase level?
[42:45.66]What the fuck does that mean?
[42:46.60]Select the higher phase level?
[42:47.90]Free chat?
[42:48.50]No.
[42:49.26]Policy 1.
[42:51.40]Anything.
[42:52.42]Friendly messages?
[42:53.32]I don't know.
[42:56.76]One invite, and I have the password for you.
[42:58.46]That's why I didn't want to show this on screen.
[43:00.10]I know it's black screen because there's a password on the screen.
[43:02.15]So, just like, I don't know, like, here, just look at this for a second.
[43:06.27]Oh, that's a red, that's a bright red.
[43:07.97]Here, just look at this.
[43:09.11]Watch this for a minute while we get this going.
[43:11.85]Okay, I'm going to team speak you this password.
[43:14.35]Okay, and tell me where to go to put it in.
[43:16.68]Okay, so, you know, where the egg is.
[43:19.14]Yeah, I'm with the portal stone right here.
[43:23.36]It looks like an egg.
[43:25.27]Is there a second egg?
[43:26.41]Yeah.
[43:26.59]No, no, no.
[43:26.97]So, like, it's a blue egg, right?
[43:28.65]Yeah.
[43:29.27]So, go.
[43:30.05]Touch it.
[43:30.41]Go, like... Yeah, I did.
[43:32.56]Uh-huh.
[43:32.80]And then you're gonna go to... I only have jump to other portal stone or jump to other headquarters?
[43:37.70]Jump to other headquarters.
[43:39.07]Okay.
[43:40.17]So jump to the headquarters.
[43:42.65]And so I can't alt tab right now for some reason because this is all fucked up.
[43:46.31]So I'm just going to say this password to you and you better do it at the same, at the right exact time.
[43:50.92]Hold on, hold on.
[43:52.04]The lobby name is room 26.
[43:53.52]I see a room 25.
[43:57.16]No, room 26 is going to pop up and I got to like write this down so I can say this to you.
[44:02.61]You're going to say it to me.
[44:03.71]I can't change this password.
[44:04.65]It's a fucking numerical.
[44:05.51]This is not going to go poorly.
[44:07.35]It's going to go great.
[44:08.01]Trust me.
[44:09.94]I'll tell you when I see room 26.
[44:11.66]You tell me when you see room 26, okay?
[44:13.28]Yeah.
[44:13.56]This is a bad idea.
[44:17.86]Alright, do you see room 26?
[44:18.58]No.
[44:20.58]Not yet.
[44:21.70]I only see 25.
[44:24.02]Why is there only one other lobby in this entire game?
[44:26.06]I don't know.
[44:27.22]I'm in room 26.
[44:31.67]No, I don't see it.
[44:32.67]Refresh.
[44:35.07]Make sure you're not region locked.
[44:43.20]Does anybody else see room 26 in chat because everyone else is looking right now?
[44:47.81]Okay, I see room 26.
[44:48.63]No free chat.
[44:55.33]So are you doing... Okay, so you're creating a lobby.
[44:58.11]And I can't even shift tab.
[45:00.00]Yeah, I created... You should be able to search for room 26.
[45:01.94]It's password protected.
[45:05.28]There's space?
[45:06.74]It's room space 26.
[45:07.62]Okay.
[45:08.54]Okay.
[45:14.71]It says I'm online.
[45:18.43]Unable to find the specified lobby.
[45:23.48]If you appear online, can I just join off of you?
[45:25.22]That's the thing.
[45:26.00]I can't alt-tab.
[45:27.12]Hold on.
[45:27.44]Can you shift-tab?
[45:28.50]No, I can't do that either.
[45:29.36]I'm going to do this, though.
[45:31.04]Okay, I'm like four.
[45:31.96]No, I can't do that either.
[45:33.76]Hold on.
[45:38.12]Hold on, hold on.
[45:40.74]I can't even, like, get Steam open.
[45:41.90]Like, I can't shift-tap or alt-tap or anything.
[45:44.98]I can't even get out of here.
[45:46.24]I'm stuck in here forever, apparently.
[45:50.84]Good, prepared stream.
[45:52.78]Hold on.
[45:53.76]Well, blame game developers for making this shit so stupidly complicated to play with your friend.
[46:00.25]Go touch the fucking portal egg and make a fucking online lobby, make a private password protected, and it doesn't show up.
[46:09.05]Like... Hold on.
[46:12.73]I'm going to go back to the menu.
[46:17.12]I'm going to double check that this is not region lock.
[46:19.40]Go see again.
[46:20.58]Make sure you're not on a region lock or something.
[46:24.32]LOL, he read my complaint.
[46:28.90]And another thing, why can't I alt-tab the game?
[46:32.60]I just try to control alt-delete.
[46:33.42]I don't know how I can.
[46:34.26]This is permanently on my monitor.
[46:35.70]I can't control alt-delete either.
[46:36.74]Alright, you try me.
[46:38.72]Let's see if we see it.
[46:40.66]That's probably a better idea.
[46:43.10]Hang on, I'm getting back into the game now.
[46:44.42]Going to the main menu.
[46:45.91]And it's wicked loud.
[46:49.91]What?
[46:50.47]Alright, whatever.
[46:52.55]Stop reading my complaints.
[46:53.73]Alright, I'm back in the village.
[46:59.98]Let's go to this fucking stone.
[47:01.52]Okay, jumping to headquarters.
[47:03.02]Playing online.
[47:04.52]Creating a lobby.
[47:05.32]Let me make sure, like, I'm not, like...
[47:14.33]What is the search people thing for?
[47:17.03]I have all of server restrictions.
[47:20.38]Data exchange.
[47:21.26]I don't know what the fuck that means.
[47:24.70]Display settings, sound settings, system settings.
[47:28.14]I mean, I have no idea.
[47:30.41]It seems like... Oh, there we go.
[47:32.73]Okay.
[47:34.11]The two blue people in the portal of the upper right should be agreed.
[47:37.03]Why can't I just fucking join a game?
[47:42.42]Alright, let me type this in to TeamSpeak.
[47:45.29]I didn't want to even talk to this guy.
[47:50.19]I'm at the fucking blue egg.
[47:53.97]And I can't interact with the egg.
[47:56.91]Alright, I've created a lobby.
[48:01.10]Don't even fucking tell me that because I have to re... Why do all video games suck?
[48:11.19]Seriously.
[48:12.21]What the fuck?
[48:12.91]Why do all these games suck such asshole?
[48:16.59]I have to do this again.
[48:17.37]Here we go.
[48:17.65]I have to do this shit again.
[48:19.69]Like, what the fuck?
[48:20.33]It's happening.
[48:23.56]I have to fucking do this whole thing again.
[48:25.82]Because I, like, I went to a previous save.
[48:31.34]That was, like, the top one.
[48:33.97]Oh my god.
[48:35.09]How fucking frustrating.
[48:37.01]You know what I did before I went to the main menu?
[48:39.37]Fucking shitty ass game.
[48:40.87]I hit save.
[48:45.96]You forgot to save.
[48:47.28]Okay.
[48:48.02]Forget to save?
[48:49.30]I know.
[48:49.62]I know we should autosave.
[48:50.82]I just wanted to fucking play multiplayer.
[48:52.42]I know.
[48:53.44]I know.
[48:53.78]We should autosave.
[48:55.02]Why do games do this still?
[48:57.41]Why do games still do this shit?
[49:00.03]Hey, look on the right side, this time- Dude, we're in two thousand fucking seventeen.
[49:06.07]Why do I have to touch a fucking stone and go into like a weird lobby to play with somebody?
[49:11.48]Like what this fucking- we're almost in 2020.
[49:14.76]All the fucking movies in the 80s that they used to talk about like the future that I was so far away is fucking close.
[49:23.23]Where's my hoverboard?
[49:26.29]Fucking blue egg portal.
[49:31.77]I think my- I think my computer just crashed.
[49:35.19]My fucking- my whole computer just died.
[49:36.87]Wait, what?
[49:38.24]The ga- You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[49:46.93]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[49:49.19]Hey.
[49:50.29]Hey!
[49:50.63]Oh, wow!
[49:51.79]Ooh!
[49:56.46]Look at that!
[49:57.28]Alright, which game is more technically sound?
[50:02.27]Took It In or Spore?
[50:04.95]Hold on a second.
[50:10.35]Oh, guys.
[50:12.25]I'm fucking so mad.
[50:15.31]Let's just show it.
[50:16.69]Here, look at, like, okay.
[50:19.91]It won't even show the monitor capture.
[50:21.59]This is all fucked up.
[50:25.56]Like, seriously, hold on.
[50:27.20]Yeah.
[50:28.47]I can't do anything.
[50:31.11]Like, what happens if I do this?
[50:33.13]I hope the stream doesn't end.
[50:35.39]Welcome to the new Jerma podcast, ladies and gentlemen.
[50:38.65]No video.
[50:39.84]Fucking God.
[50:42.18]And I can't even capture my... My whole computer just broke.
[50:46.30]Texture map failed.
[50:47.90]XOX... Like...
[50:50.85]I just wanted to play a game with my friend.
[50:54.73]It's 49 minutes and I still can't do that.
[50:59.15]What a fucking joke.
[51:05.00]I might have to restart the stream.
[51:08.08]Uh oh.
[51:09.14]Oh my god.
[51:12.59]What the fuck is that?
[51:14.61]What's up?
[51:15.45]Welcome to the new stream.
[51:17.59]So the map texture didn't load.
[51:21.01]And it crashed everything and turned off OBS.
[51:26.24]I mean, like, we are talking a fucking fantastic game.
[51:32.96]TeamSpeak survived.
[51:34.38]I fucking swear to God.
[51:36.90]I'm going to give this one more try.
[51:38.38]Mm-hmm.
[51:39.87]Before I refund this fucking game.
[51:45.21]Oh, boy.
[51:47.63]How far we have fallen in such a short amount of time.
[51:50.21]You're setting new records.
[51:53.71]I would go off on a fucking massive rant right now.
[51:56.87]Like, I would go off on, like, a fuck you rant right now for, like, the game industry.
[52:01.49]I'm not gonna.
[52:02.50]I'm gonna hold back.
[52:03.28]But cover your ears.
[52:05.60]But cover your ears.
[52:07.78]Why?
[52:07.90]Because you're gonna do it anyway?
[52:09.06]I might.
[52:14.93]I might.
[52:16.99]The game won't even turn on.
[52:19.40]The game won't even fucking turn on.
[52:20.84]What the fuck?
[52:25.54]It's gonna... Oh, god damn it, man.
[52:28.36]Getting to the next level.
[52:30.18]We're going to the next level.
[52:32.02]The game won't even fucking turn on.
[52:35.98]Oh.
[52:37.34]Oh.
[52:38.24]So, can you control delete now?
[52:39.52]Now I have some process running.
[52:40.76]Now I can control out delete.
[52:42.75]Let me kill the fucking process.
[52:47.94]I don't even know where it is.
[52:48.77]Oh my god.
[52:56.59]It's not even here.
[53:03.36]Is this streamer great or what?
[53:05.04]Blame the fucking stupid shit game that has so many hoops to jump through to do anything and then crashes for no reason.
[53:13.68]It ain't my fault.
[53:19.39]It's mine.
[53:20.10]It's all my fault.
[53:21.96]I'm the one that suggested this game.
[53:24.00]I didn't know.
[53:24.54]It's not even on here.
[53:25.28]How could I have known?
[53:26.36]This shit is just not even on here.
[53:27.62]Like, oh my god.
[53:30.94]Can we get with the fucking program?
[53:32.87]Oh, now it's loading now.
[53:34.09]Here it is.
[53:36.49]No, no, it's not.
[53:37.75]Oh god.
[53:38.97]Okay.
[53:44.08]Fucking Koei Tecmo.
[53:51.27]Etalyx at the stake.
[53:52.23]Auto-save progress.
[53:55.75]20, like, manual save, auto-save progress.
[54:02.16]I swear to God, if this crashes again, I swear to God, if this crashes again, and the stream dies again, Hell hath no fury like a Jerma's corn.
[54:11.40]I couldn't refund this fucking game fast enough if it crashes again.
[54:17.29]I couldn't fucking refund it fast enough.
[54:20.03]You know how fast I'm skipping the dialog and the cutscenes in this game?
[54:22.37]I'll refund this game faster than that.
[54:31.11]What's my favorite aspect ratio?
[54:35.42]16 by 9.
[54:35.76]Yeah, I'm back.
[54:43.41]I just want to play a game.
[54:47.11]Koei Tecmo port, that explains everything.
[54:48.91]Yeah, fuck this company!
[54:51.21]Stop selling these fucking games on Steam!
[54:55.03]That you half-ass and piss out for fucking like an hour of game development.
[54:59.43]Cut that shit out!
[55:00.37]Hey, they're too busy working on Dynasty Warriors 18.
[55:09.11]I don't got time for that.
[55:09.99]I'm so scared to like hit X. Oh, you've done it now, Koei Tecmo.
[55:13.59]Eat a Snickers.
[55:27.64]it's actually a good port I I'm just obviously just kidding I'm just venting at the moment but like hey kidding I'm just kidding prank even prank please don't crash again it didn't crash for like 40 straight minutes
[55:51.29]We should go play the good version of this game.
[55:54.83]Fucking Monster Hunter.
[55:59.82]They just saw Monster Hunter was cool and were like, We're gonna make that too!
[56:10.43]Don't crash, please.
[56:14.84]Well, I get to do this part again.
[56:16.60]Assuming it didn't crash.
[56:18.60]Well, it didn't crash this time.
[56:19.66]Monster Hunter.
[56:20.62]Yeah, yeah, I get it.
[56:21.42]Yeah, I understand how to do this.
[56:23.70]Why would it not auto-save after this, by the way?
[56:38.68]Ah, it's a great question.
[56:41.04]Considering it's the final part of that tutorial chapter.
[56:45.33]At least some gameplay again.
[56:47.31]Trust me, I know.
[56:49.04]I'm very aware.
[56:55.29]And, like, here's the thing, right?
[56:56.31]Like, I'm gonna give you guys, like, an explanation.
[56:59.33]Like, I like to go into games blind because I don't want to know anything about them and I want it to be, like, a real experience.
[57:06.35]I want it to be, like, I'm not fucking around.
[57:08.09]It's not like I'm, like, pretending like I haven't seen shit before, right?
[57:11.79]But sometimes, like, I think, man, like, some of these games just aren't fucking worth doing that for.
[57:17.90]This is one of them.
[57:23.72]I want, like, a genuine experience, but, like, man, sometimes I should just play these games for, like, fucking a couple hours off stream just to see if they're gonna be fucking stupid like this.
[57:33.01]I don't like doing that, though.
[57:34.87]Because then, if something really cool happens or something really funny happens, I already saw it, and I have to, like, pretend I didn't... I gotta pretend I didn't fucking see it.
[57:51.49]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[58:10.29]Ameroman, no, I am not in the background.
[58:12.97]Like, I'm so sorry, Jerma.
[58:14.38]This happens kind of frequently to the point where it doesn't face me anymore.
[58:19.64]It's sad but true that there's so many games that screw up and don't work the way they're supposed to.
[58:28.74]And that's the thing.
[58:29.36]It's hard for anybody to know that that was going to happen.
[58:31.58]That's the problem.
[58:33.79]We're so cursed.
[58:34.49]I feel like this shit happens all the fucking time.
[58:40.72]Like, my fucking game shouldn't crash and turn off OBS.
[58:43.88]Like, that shouldn't fucking happen.
[58:45.84]Yeah.
[58:47.84]There's no contingency plan for that.
[58:55.62]Dauntless and Alpha is almost better.
[58:57.20]I wish I could try Dauntless.
[58:59.24]It looks interesting.
[58:59.98]I gotta turn the volume down currently.
[59:01.78]It's, like, loud as hell.
[59:04.48]That's another Monster Hunter game.
[59:06.94]Let's try this again.
[59:07.68]And let me... I'm so salty at the moment.
[59:25.41]That feeling when Jerma will never go back to New Vegas, but will play trash like this.
[59:29.27]Well, I mean, I played the fuck out of New Vegas.
[59:32.29]Look, I did so much shit in New Vegas that I can't do anything anymore.
[59:37.02]I spawned like 400 fucking deathclaws and ran into the atmosphere.
[59:42.08]How do you do that?
[59:43.73]I used the fucking time gun.
[59:45.69]You can't top the time gun.
[59:48.74]Me going back to Fallout New Vegas would be like, I'd just be playing the game normally and it would just be like, I kinda, I kinda like used the time gun already.
[59:56.49]So it's hard to do that.
[60:01.73]When you break a game, you break it in more ways than one.
[60:05.37]Everything except play the game.
[60:06.29]I played, I played, I got to like a pro, like a good 10 hours into that game.
[60:09.97]Yeah.
[60:19.39]playing the game.
[60:21.07]Yeah, actually playing.
[60:22.50]Okay.
[60:28.98]So make that- make that room Etalyx.
[60:31.50]I've made it.
[60:32.52]But I have my... questions about it.
[60:39.53]I've always had trouble in the past with other games creating lobbies because, uh, Bitdefender... Mm-hmm.
[60:44.31]...hates me.
[60:45.18]So...
[60:47.85]Everything always starts so promising.
[60:49.89]And then like... I'm gonna make my own fucking game company.
[60:53.58]I'm making my own game company.
[60:56.00]And guess what?
[60:56.50]It's not gonna be a fucking hour of text at the very beginning of the game.
[60:59.84]I can promise you that.
[61:01.66]No tutorial either.
[61:02.44]It's just there, boom.
[61:03.48]You push start, you're already in.
[61:05.64]No loading screen.
[61:06.72]Let's go over Hollow Knight.
[61:07.72]Let's talk about Hollow Knight for a second.
[61:09.84]That game didn't have fucking an hour of text in the beginning.
[61:14.79]The tutorial was like, as you played it, like, let you know certain specific things.
[61:18.92]Like, just, where is that?
[61:21.46]I don't give a shit about your dumb fucking town.
[61:24.28]Your town sucks.
[61:25.02]Who cares?
[61:25.48]I want to kill monsters.
[61:26.90]I don't care about your shitty storyline that no one cares about.
[61:46.09]Remember Monster Hunter?
[61:46.81]You just played it.
[61:52.20]And even when there was dialog, it was like, it made sense.
[61:58.62]Sounds good.
[61:59.04]Make sure you save after this is over.
[62:01.74]Different people like different things.
[62:04.88]Different people suck.
[62:06.12]No, that's not what I mean.
[62:07.90]It's just like...
[62:21.86]I feel like in a game like this, this doesn't have to be here.
[62:27.20]Or at least there should be, it can be there, but put one button off to the side where it says push this button to skip whole thing.
[62:35.37]Just let you skip the whole thing simultaneously.
[62:43.88]Like, cutscenes are good, but not when they're mandatory.
[62:46.94]Well, here's another thing, right?
[62:48.50]This ain't a cutscene.
[62:50.80]This is a picture of people.
[62:52.46]There's text there.
[62:53.64]It's just like, I don't want to do that!
[62:57.69]Do not play Persona 5, then.
[63:01.31]I don't play Persona.
[63:02.97]Skip the whole game.
[63:03.91]I was just reading someone's chat.
[63:06.87]Yeah, yeah, okay.
[63:10.39]Thank you.
[63:11.87]Okay.
[63:12.01]Okay.
[63:13.91]Apparently I'm pretty loud.
[63:16.25]Everything got all fucked up.
[63:17.33]The whole game went down.
[63:20.66]Just avoid JRPGs.
[63:23.92]Well, I liked Monster Hunter.
[63:26.38]This looked like it was going to be kind of like Monster Hunter.
[63:28.52]Okay, I'm jumping to other headquarters.
[63:33.71]Save, save, save.
[63:35.33]Oh, fuck, man.
[63:35.97]I have to save the game.
[63:37.17]Shit.
[63:37.87]Why would it not auto-save?
[63:39.47]How do you save?
[63:42.07]Okay, saved.
[63:43.79]Jump to other headquarters.
[63:44.97]Play online.
[63:46.81]Search for lobby.
[63:49.71]Okay, method search.
[63:51.45]Free chat.
[63:52.75]Whatever.
[63:57.44]Are you room 25?
[63:58.08]No, I'm room 21.
[63:58.68]Can you only see room 25?
[64:00.12]Yeah.
[64:12.83]Yeah, I can see, uh, wait, wait, wait, what are you?
[64:14.89]Room 4?
[64:16.12]21.
[64:16.56]Fuck, what is this?
[64:17.56]Room 4, 46?
[64:19.50]Hold on a second.
[64:20.22]Okay.
[64:29.70]Server, all versions.
[64:33.96]I'm turning on just all these policies, like... No policy.
[64:41.63]Lobby name.
[64:42.49]What was it?
[64:44.75]21.
[64:45.19]Whatever.
[64:45.47]No, 25.
[64:45.97]I don't even... I don't even fucking know.
[64:58.78]Phase one.
[64:59.46]Here.
[65:00.36]Let me change some stuff.
[65:04.24]Once you've started a lobby, can you not, like, cancel it?
[65:06.88]Is that the problem you were having earlier?
[65:08.28]Yeah.
[65:10.64]Oh, hang on.
[65:11.76]Exiting the lobby.
[65:12.77]The thing is, like, I- I- I got- The next, like, two months of streams are gonna be so good.
[65:16.79]Like, I- I- I have so- You- You make one.
[65:18.19]I have so many fucking games.
[65:19.85]I bought, like, 40 goddamn games on Amazon.
[65:23.03]Like, they're all coming in, they're all trickling in.
[65:24.67]No, I- This- This shit is done.
[65:27.92]This- This- This, like, turn-on game, game ends up being a piece of shit.
[65:33.36]Stream sucks.
[65:34.62]That's not gonna fucking happen anymore.
[65:37.62]Like, game can't even be played with friend.
[65:40.17]Like... That shit fucking ain't happening anymore.
[65:44.89]Alright, make a lobby.
[65:46.61]Write the... Make the name... Room fucking 91.
[65:49.85]Alright, the room's gonna... I would love to... I'd love to do that.
[65:53.55]I'd love to fucking type something here.
[65:56.31]And my... I think I crashed.
[66:04.29]Oh, please, no.
[66:07.19]Say it ain't so.
[66:16.95]This shit ain't happening ever again.
[66:18.81]Did it actually crash?
[66:19.65]Hold on.
[66:25.41]Hold on a second.
[66:28.48]But you're right.
[66:29.00]For some reason, you're not allowed to type in the lobby name.
[66:31.46]I can't type the lobby name.
[66:32.68]I'm back.
[66:34.68]I can't type a lobby name.
[66:36.50]So we're gonna do invite one person, search, uh... I think I figured this out.
[66:41.12]You figured it out.
[66:42.23]But you make the lobby.
[66:43.29]Well, there's the password!
[66:44.83]Okay, password, good.
[66:48.25]Can't change the fucking... Wait, now I can!
[66:49.97]Alright, I think this is working now.
[66:57.04]Just make a new one.
[66:57.90]Okay.
[67:01.20]I can change the room now.
[67:02.68]The room name is gonna be...
[67:08.77]The room name's not fun and the password is fuck this.
[67:13.47]All one word?
[67:15.23]Not fun is the name of the room.
[67:16.50]And fuck this is the password.
[67:18.90]Okay, free chat is no.
[67:21.06]Policy one, anything.
[67:22.08]Policy two, friendly.
[67:23.80]Target?
[67:24.90]No.
[67:25.26]No, like a mission.
[67:27.02]Phase one.
[67:28.21]First battle.
[67:29.23]Like, should I pick one of these?
[67:32.41]No, I think the restrictions is so a level 12 guy can't join you or something like that.
[67:36.33]Okay, not fun, fuck this.
[67:39.28]I'm making it.
[67:40.98]Okay.
[67:41.46]Alright.
[67:42.00]Do you see?
[67:42.75]Not fun.
[67:43.33]Fuck this.
[67:50.67]And here.
[67:51.39]Let me do this.
[67:52.43]Did you actually push create?
[67:54.02]Yeah.
[67:54.24]Here you go.
[67:58.32]Get in here.
[67:59.58]I actually can... I can actually shift... No, I can't shift tab back into the game.
[68:06.13]I can't shift tab.
[68:07.83]I can't even fucking move now.
[68:11.39]I invited you.
[68:12.45]I fucking personally invited you.
[68:13.83]Did you get it?
[68:14.55]Oh, wait.
[68:14.89]You have personally invited me?
[68:16.07]I gave you a personal invite.
[68:18.67]Oh.
[68:20.63]Yeah, I got it.
[68:22.03]Can you get in?
[68:23.39]I was joining.
[68:28.00]Oh!
[68:28.20]Did it work?
[68:28.92]Did it work?
[68:29.30]You're in here.
[68:29.66]You're here.
[68:31.48]Thank God.
[68:32.06]Where'd you go?
[68:36.43]Am I not there anymore?
[68:37.26]Where'd you go?
[68:38.74]Was I, like, right next to you?
[68:39.62]You were right there.
[68:40.90]You were so close.
[68:41.48]I hit B twice.
[68:42.56]You were so close.
[68:44.24]Apparently, hitting B, like, took me back out to... It just invited me again.
[68:50.08]No, I don't know if I'm gonna be able to.
[68:52.41]Can you shift-tab now?
[68:53.65]I can, like, one... Here we go.
[68:55.39]Try it again.
[69:02.75]Okay, I accepted.
[69:04.23]Oh, my God.
[69:05.25]Did it work?
[69:07.39]I don't know.
[69:08.21]You appeared for a second and then you disappeared.
[69:16.53]I think it says I'm in a game.
[69:18.70]I can promise you right now this shit is never fucking happening again.
[69:21.56]It says I'm in the lobby.
[69:22.80]Like if I talk to the stone, the option is exit lobby.
[69:26.12]Exit the lobby and come back.
[69:30.88]What if I'm just a ghost?
[69:31.98]What if we're still in the same game but we can't see each other until we go into the world?
[69:35.62]I could just see you right there.
[69:40.34]Okay, exited the lobby.
[69:42.06]So I'm no longer in a multiplayer game.
[69:52.42]I can't wait to refund this game.
[69:55.02]You're not going to be able to as long as it's been.
[69:57.67]And the reason why for refunding, it's going to write in all caps, EAT MY SHIT.
[70:04.33]And then refund.
[70:09.53]How do I find these shitty B-games?
[70:10.90]This ain't a shitty B-game!
[70:11.86]This game was 60 fucking dollars!
[70:14.14]This isn't some like shitty like B-game.
[70:16.26]This is like a fucking game, like a new release on Steam that's 60 bucks.
[70:26.63]Alright, now it says you're here.
[70:27.87]It says you're here.
[70:28.39]No, it's lying.
[70:29.65]What do you mean it's lying?
[70:30.61]It's lying.
[70:31.47]It's not lying.
[70:32.01]I can like come look at you.
[70:34.23]I can look at your invisible marker.
[70:35.25]Won't be there in a second.
[70:39.97]Because I joined on you twice and nothing happened.
[70:42.48]And then when I went to quit to main menu, then you were like, I see you now.
[70:48.68]At least I had 90 hairstyles.
[70:50.16]That's right.
[70:50.56]10 more minutes of this.
[70:53.98]Wait a second.
[70:55.22]Am I still there?
[70:56.32]No.
[70:57.08]Another few minutes and I'm going to have to just jump over to Hollow Knight.
[71:01.93]We're getting to the realm of it's been an hour.
[71:04.75]It's been like an hour technical tutorial stream.
[71:17.66]What happened?
[71:19.14]What happened?
[71:20.46]Did your game crash, didn't it?
[71:21.52]No.
[71:22.16]Yeah, it did.
[71:22.66]I just saw it pop up that you're now playing.
[71:24.74]That's it.
[71:25.12]It's over.
[71:26.04]No.
[71:26.36]You said five minutes.
[71:28.02]You crashed.
[71:28.52]Your game crashed.
[71:29.16]No.
[71:29.70]You said five minutes.
[71:30.88]Don't lie to me.
[71:31.32]Did your game crash?
[71:31.94]No, no, no.
[71:32.70]No.
[71:33.26]Hold on.
[71:34.08]You said five minutes.
[71:35.74]Just give me, like, two of those minutes.
[71:39.82]This is the last attempt, okay?
[71:42.46]Oh, my God.
[71:44.55]This is the last try.
[71:46.41]Dude, like, somebody made a joke, like, play one of those, like, virus games while I wait.
[71:49.71]Like, the virus games worked.
[71:53.37]May have given me a fucking virus, but they worked.
[71:59.80]Okay, this is the last attempt.
[72:01.06]Last attempt.
[72:03.26]Let's see if this works.
[72:06.99]I'm not gonna push any weird buttons.
[72:10.78]It says you're here.
[72:11.82]There you are.
[72:12.90]There I am.
[72:13.30]Alright, don't do anything weird.
[72:14.54]Don't even move.
[72:15.02]Okay.
[72:17.64]Okay.
[72:18.00]I'm here.
[72:18.40]It worked.
[72:21.12]It worked.
[72:22.12]It worked.
[72:22.92]Now what?
[72:25.62]Now we get to play to Kaiden.
[72:28.06]Hey, you want to eat some food together?
[72:29.66]Okay, let's order some... No, I don't have any money.
[72:32.56]We can't do that.
[72:33.36]I've got 2100.
[72:33.86]But I don't have enough materials.
[72:37.26]We've got to do some crafting.
[72:40.29]What can I do for you?
[72:41.27]Don't craft anything.
[72:43.45]No, let's just go on a mission.
[72:44.61]We have to go fight things now before we lose everybody.
[72:49.08]Hey, do you like how not fun lobby info is just plastered at the top of the screen?
[72:58.46]I'm not even going to push the button.
[72:59.89]I'm willing to put up with it if it means the game doesn't crash.
[73:03.77]Okay.
[73:08.07]You've not taken on any missions.
[73:09.69]You gotta get a mission.
[73:11.45]Etalyx, we might have done something wrong.
[73:14.28]No.
[73:15.30]Everything's good now.
[73:16.04]Where's the missions, then?
[73:18.34]Uh, find somebody with an exclamation mark.
[73:20.30]There is no one with an exclamation mark.
[73:22.60]Seriously?
[73:24.82]I don't see any exclamation marks.
[73:28.88]There we go.
[73:29.48]Group mission.
[73:30.18]Thank God.
[73:30.74]Okay, group mission.
[73:32.54]First battle.
[73:33.92]Do it.
[73:34.48]Um...
[73:35.99]Why do these look like companions?
[73:37.53]We don't want any companions.
[73:38.63]No, no companions.
[73:39.31]Get them out of here.
[73:39.75]Okay.
[73:42.13]Holy shit.
[73:42.87]Are we actually going to play the game?
[73:45.73]Yes.
[73:46.15]Did you get a mission?
[73:47.09]It says, please wait a moment.
[73:48.13]Another player is currently selecting a mission.
[73:54.52]I just picked it.
[73:55.80]You just picked it?
[73:56.96]Yep.
[73:57.40]It says, please wait a moment.
[74:01.12]It says we're on a mission.
[74:02.46]We're on a mission.
[74:03.00]It says please wait a moment.
[74:05.07]No, it says we're on a mission right now.
[74:07.71]Another player is currently selecting a mission.
[74:09.17]Please wait a moment.
[74:12.69]I did it.
[74:13.15]What do you mean you did it?
[74:15.58]We're on the mission right now.
[74:16.58]No, we're not.
[74:17.26]I'm sitting here looking at this screen.
[74:19.14]It says some party members have not yet accepted the mission.
[74:21.94]Leave anyway?
[74:22.98]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[74:26.06]I guess I see first battle now.
[74:28.24]Yeah, it's first battle, that's what we're looking for.
[74:30.99]Did you accept the mission?
[74:32.25]You did.
[74:33.35]Good.
[74:34.69]We can play the game now.
[74:39.61]We're playing the video game.
[74:40.51]Are we playing the game?
[74:41.81]Yeah, this is the video game.
[74:43.01]Holy shit, we're playing the game.
[74:44.59]No, Nash, to Kaido.
[74:45.81]Holy fuck, we're actually in the game.
[74:46.93]It only took like two hours.
[74:47.98]It took like an hour and ten minutes.
[74:50.36]To be fair though, the first 30 or 40 minutes, we were not trying to play together yet.
[74:55.00]Okay.
[74:56.67]Take a deep breath.
[74:57.51]First time you strike an enemy, your game's gonna crash.
[74:59.87]Don't fucking ever say that.
[75:01.21]It's okay, though, because you're not gonna hit anyone.
[75:09.13]What's the first mission?
[75:10.06]Kill bugs?
[75:10.80]Kill these bug people?
[75:11.78]This is starter mission, so whatever.
[75:14.64]I just wanted to, you know, get in the game.
[75:16.46]Just get us in there.
[75:19.20]Get us in.
[75:21.74]How do you want to tick?
[75:22.24]How do you want to do this?
[75:22.78]You want me to get rid of the... This guy can't even hit me.
[75:25.28]I don't think he can physically hit me.
[75:31.70]He hit me.
[75:33.40]I can't hit him.
[75:33.84]With what?
[75:34.46]He swung.
[75:36.04]Apparently he's too far.
[75:37.00]He's dead.
[75:37.60]Good.
[75:37.82]We killed him.
[75:41.50]Mission's over.
[75:42.30]No, I don't... Is it?
[75:43.44]I don't know.
[75:43.82]What are we supposed to do?
[75:45.40]Better not.
[75:47.42]That was the mission, ladies and gentlemen.
[75:50.58]I'm going to hold back my reservations on this right now.
[75:54.92]Hold on.
[75:56.12]Is this the starter mission?
[75:57.81]Everybody calm down.
[75:59.67]Nobody get angry.
[76:00.41]Nobody flip out.
[76:01.93]We got to give it a proper chance now that we can play it.
[76:03.97]Don't anybody say anything bad about the game.
[76:07.26]Forget everything I said.
[76:09.32]We're not going to trash this game right now.
[76:12.18]Don't say anything bad.
[76:18.22]don't say one negative no negative things we'd like we don't have a chance to okay there's a big slug over here kind of cool kind of cool come over here and see this it's cool alright see this is your problem you should have not been gun boy no you should have been okay you look at see look at what I can do what can you do come watch this look come over these guys check this out
[76:44.45]It was way cooler than shooting a rifle.
[76:46.69]Yeah.
[76:48.13]It's way cooler.
[76:49.26]It's way cooler.
[76:50.44]Maybe I'll change weapons.
[76:53.36]Oh yeah?
[76:53.68]Slug's here!
[76:54.42]You think that's fucking cool?
[76:57.48]Take a look at what I can do.
[76:59.24]Check this out.
[77:00.55]I'm watching.
[77:05.21]Pretty cool.
[77:07.19]You seem like you're doing good as the slug.
[77:09.89]Oh yeah, but you can't do this!
[77:16.07]I might change with the gun.
[77:18.87]It seems more fun to actually hit things.
[77:24.66]Nobody say anything?
[77:25.58]I saw at least two people say something bad about this.
[77:28.46]Ban them.
[77:29.22]Don't say anything bad about this.
[77:35.29]Not yet.
[77:36.11]One slugged down.
[77:36.97]One slugged down.
[77:38.15]Nobody say anything bad.
[77:43.63]Do these guys have to be taquitined?
[77:46.36]They do.
[77:50.54]Yeah, the gun looks really boring, I'm not gonna lie.
[77:52.87]It is.
[77:56.57]It is, but we might need me to stay this to have range.
[77:59.65]I'll switch.
[78:01.65]No, that's okay.
[78:02.09]Why would you want to play the boring class on purpose?
[78:06.07]Drug vision.
[78:11.38]We win.
[78:11.70]There you go, guys.
[78:13.96]There's your three minutes and 34 seconds of gameplay in an hour and 25 minutes stream.
[78:22.87]Are we going to get a boss?
[78:24.83]How do we get out of here?
[78:26.53]I can do the fists.
[78:27.55]There's 12 seconds.
[78:29.53]I think it's just 12 seconds.
[78:30.59]I'm disappointed that the up arrows, the D-pad doesn't do emotes.
[78:36.39]Okay, I'm going to go to the gloves.
[78:37.75]We'll try the gloves.
[78:39.44]No, I didn't like the gloves.
[78:40.88]Big gloves aren't good.
[78:42.20]Do like a big weapon.
[78:44.56]Okay.
[78:47.80]I will do that.
[78:48.82]Do like the big sword or the daggers or anything else.
[78:54.61]Okay, change equipment.
[78:55.45]Get rid of the gun.
[78:57.51]A sturdy sword and shield.
[78:59.61]Chain whip.
[79:01.01]Long sword, dual knives, long spear.
[79:04.16]Chain and circle.
[79:04.74]What are you using?
[79:05.56]Alright, so for these Dynasty Warriors types games, you should try like the big spear, the giant sword.
[79:11.73]I'm going with the big club.
[79:14.13]Okay, big club.
[79:15.81]I'm going with the gigantic Mario, Super Mario, don't land on me spinny thing that's in some of the levels.
[79:24.07]Alright, I'm going to try the chain whip.
[79:26.58]Cool.
[79:27.86]Let's do the next part.
[79:30.09]Let's just pick the last highest tier thing we can.
[79:33.19]Do you want to do the highest tier thing?
[79:35.33]Do you think we're ready for that?
[79:36.33]We don't even have to do consumables.
[79:38.31]Here's the thing.
[79:39.01]We're going from boring slugs.
[79:41.13]I want to see what's at the other end of that difficulty.
[79:43.47]Alright, so go for it.
[79:46.61]You go pick the hard mission.
[79:50.81]By the way, getting dangerously close to not being able to refund.
[79:56.94]Hope it's good.
[79:58.36]Hope it's good.
[79:59.58]Alright.
[80:00.24]We have two two-star difficulties Would you like to fight the wind shredder who looks like a wolf?
[80:05.86]Mm-hmm, or would you like to fight the brute claw who looks like a Starcraft 2?
[80:11.10]insect brew claw for sure Let's go get that brute claw We're getting dangerously close.
[80:19.35]I don't think I can refund I
[80:20.68]We are like 22 minutes away from not being refundable.
[80:23.58]I think you can refund.
[80:24.64]I don't think I can.
[80:26.06]Did you accept?
[80:28.53]I think I just have to... Yeah.
[80:32.95]Alright, you ready for actual monsters?
[80:35.13]This should be actual monsters.
[80:36.97]It's a tier 2.
[80:38.83]Somebody says, dude, please get out of here.
[80:41.07]No, you want us to get out of here when you see this?
[80:45.83]I'm ready.
[80:48.86]Alright, I gotta practice my moves.
[80:50.94]Alright, I'm gonna wrap around the rear.
[81:00.71]Alright, nice.
[81:01.11]I'm going for a double overhead swing.
[81:03.45]How much health?
[81:06.55]So he's got like, what, purple armor?
[81:07.91]Yeah, I think he's got purple armor.
[81:08.73]Did you put the arrow in his leg, or what?
[81:11.31]I did not.
[81:12.31]There's like a purple arrow over here.
[81:14.43]I'm kind of just like swinging over and over again.
[81:18.43]Your B button is supposed to be some kind of special attack.
[81:21.25]Is it really?
[81:21.75]Well, let's do it.
[81:26.32]That doesn't seem too smart.
[81:28.90]What was it?
[81:30.94]No, no, no.
[81:32.96]We're doing okay.
[81:34.10]Attack his legs.
[81:34.86]Those are his weak points, right?
[81:37.52]You also are supposed to combo with the right trigger.
[81:41.09]Right trigger.
[81:41.99]Right trigger.
[81:43.07]Attach yourself to him.
[81:45.19]When you're up in the air...
[81:47.49]You can hit the high points.
[81:49.21]Hit the high notes.
[81:49.93]I'm just going to sit here and do this for a minute.
[81:55.43]Okay.
[81:59.34]Alright, we got him.
[82:01.72]Is there a lock-on that I don't know about?
[82:04.02]I don't think so.
[82:05.96]Yes, there is.
[82:06.36]It's L1.
[82:09.50]Oh, it is.
[82:15.65]Is there a stamina bar?
[82:19.99]He's enraged.
[82:21.01]This is gonna get much harder.
[82:27.05]Chain guy seems a lot more fun than your guy.
[82:29.69]Why do you pick the most boring ones you could pick?
[82:31.39]I don't know about this shit.
[82:33.50]How am I supposed to know?
[82:34.22]And I missed it.
[82:36.04]I told you, like, hey, if I were you, I'd pick these two.
[82:38.48]Which one are you going to pick?
[82:40.72]He's almost halfway dead.
[82:42.18]I'm almost dead.
[82:43.57]You're almost dead.
[82:45.15]Yeah, he's been hitting me.
[82:46.73]Left bumper and holding left bumper and A, right?
[82:49.45]It's like a heal.
[82:50.87]I think it's recovery.
[82:53.61]Yeah, it's A or X. I don't think I have that.
[82:57.43]What is it?
[82:57.85]Left bumper?
[82:59.15]Hold down.
[82:59.89]Sorry.
[83:00.19]Right bumper.
[83:01.03]And you'll get a little menu.
[83:08.02]No, I don't have that menu.
[83:10.50]Might be like a chain guy thing.
[83:13.79]Maybe it is a chain guy thing.
[83:19.25]He's got armor again.
[83:20.43]I think we're supposed to be hitting the purpley arrow things that are in him.
[83:29.00]Purpley arrow things?
[83:30.58]You don't see those on the left?
[83:32.38]Maybe those are just for me.
[83:33.92]No, I do not.
[83:38.68]I'm, like, whacking his legs.
[83:42.20]Yeah.
[83:42.66]Like, his left back leg has stuff on it for me.
[83:47.55]His back left leg is orange.
[83:53.15]I think this means it's damaged.
[83:58.00]So what's up with his tail?
[84:00.10]Um, I don't know.
[84:12.45]I'm not going to lie to you, I'm about to Alt F4 this one.
[84:14.69]I knew you were going to say that.
[84:19.01]I was going to say something similar.
[84:20.61]How much time do I have left?
[84:25.88]How much time?
[84:27.06]How much time is left?
[84:27.86]Can I refund it?
[84:30.64]I'm going to be real.
[84:32.32]The character that I'm playing is actually fun to play.
[84:35.31]What's not fun is how much health this guy has compared to lack of mechanics.
[84:40.15]I think we may need to have upgraded our weapons.
[84:44.88]I think we were supposed to play through all the boring stuff.
[84:47.24]That's probably what it is.
[84:50.92]But he doesn't have any discernible mechanics either, does he?
[84:53.64]I mean, I guess not.
[84:55.06]Not that I can tell.
[84:55.94]He does that forward slash.
[84:58.89]Sometimes he looks my way and then I move gingerly to the right or left of him, so he can't hit me I mean, he's like he recovered everything again Yeah, we need like better upgraded weapon yes, so okay yep Okay, good.
[85:17.23]I'm about to ult F4.
[85:19.55]What about carnage?
[85:20.57]I can give this to you.
[85:21.64]Here's double carnage!
[85:23.34]Get him!
[85:26.82]I don't think we can win
[85:32.21]We're just, like, whacking.
[85:32.99]We are whacking.
[85:34.75]I don't think it's possible for us to win.
[85:37.27]No, we're not supposed to be here.
[85:39.13]No.
[85:39.29]We're not supposed to be here.
[85:42.77]These are the tutorial weapons.
[85:45.15]These are the tutorial weapons.
[85:46.81]This quest was red when I selected it.
[85:50.78]So... You thought, you know what?
[85:53.80]Next time we need to listen to, like, Italic's intuition.
[85:57.10]I'm dead.
[85:57.56]I know what we can do.
[85:59.50]Guess what we can do.
[86:01.28]We can play Bloody Trapland 2.
[86:02.90]The new worlds came out.
[86:04.18]Oh, yeah.
[86:05.26]We're doing that.
[86:06.10]Let me revive you.
[86:07.33]Oh, hey!
[86:07.83]Let me press the X button.
[86:10.61]Whee!
[86:11.55]Alright, before we try that, I want you to try the chain guy.
[86:15.47]Just once.
[86:16.01]I think you're gonna respawn.
[86:18.88]Because he's actually pretty decent.
[86:21.90]But how do we quit out of this?
[86:24.66]Quit this mission and return to the village.
[86:26.86]We're gonna get, like, deserter.
[86:33.60]What did you do?
[86:35.84]I quit out and returned to the village.
[86:37.74]Are you gone?
[86:38.60]I'm still in your game, but... You're still in the game, like, fighting.
[86:42.48]Hold on.
[86:42.80]What if I do quit, too?
[86:44.18]Quit.
[86:47.36]Mission failed.
[86:52.30]Okay.
[86:58.06]You're fighting Alatreon with red sharpness.
[87:06.09]This just makes me want to play Monster Hunter.
[87:08.83]I was going to ask, like, I've never played Monster Hunter, so what is the key difference between this game and that game?
[87:14.95]Monster Hunter is fun.
[87:20.67]Monster Hunter, you, like, track the enemies.
[87:23.94]I think you're supposed to do that.
[87:26.08]But we kind of got, like, a red circle around us and fought the guy.
[87:29.06]You know, our reservations.
[87:31.64]It might be, like, a co-op thing.
[87:33.00]It might be.
[87:33.44]I don't know.
[87:36.04]I ain't gonna lie, like... Is there an open world?
[87:38.35]The initial hour of this game, like, turned me off so much that, like, there might be that.
[87:44.05]That is possibly that.
[87:44.99]And I believe I'm not... I'm in single player now.
[87:49.79]It says I'm still in a thing.
[87:51.07]It says I'm still in your game.
[87:55.24]You're definitely not in my game.
[88:00.84]Alright.
[88:02.68]Alright.
[88:04.40]Let's see.
[88:06.62]This is exactly Monster Hunter with a different theme.
[88:08.62]Alright, let's... Let's go.
[88:14.55]Hey, I hope you guys enjoyed that stream.
[88:16.95]So let me do something here.
[88:18.27]Let me do what I do sometimes.
[88:19.83]Let me sit here and apologize for the first half of this stream.
[88:25.16]I'm going to straight up apologize because we ran into a bunch of problems again.
[88:32.85]Glad I could be a part of another apology stream.
[88:35.07]This shit ain't gonna fucking happen again.
[88:36.53]I can promise you that.
[88:38.09]I've gotten pretty good at that.
[88:41.29]I ain't fucking doing that shit again.
[88:44.69]It happens.
[88:45.59]I like playing games blind.
[88:46.89]I like going into shit blind.
[88:47.90]And I like not knowing what if something fucking happens.
[88:50.12]What if you see something interesting.
[88:52.52]Shit like this, I gotta fucking play for like an hour or two before the stream starts.
[88:56.65]There's another aspect to it though, and that's what I was talking to you about when we... I got on there to play Fistful of Frags while you were getting done with Spore.
[89:05.05]And sometimes the technical difficulties are enjoyable in a weird, sadistic way.
[89:11.45]Right, but like I... This...
[89:14.68]I don't want it to show like fucking technical problems for like a fucking hour.
[89:20.02]Yeah, but at least you saved a lot of people 60 bucks.
[89:23.70]I mean, maybe somebody likes this shit.
[89:25.52]It's possible.
[89:27.23]We just ran into a bunch of like dumb things.
[89:28.99]But when you do shit blind, that's what happens.
[89:32.75]I just don't want to like play a game and have something cool happen and then me have to like delete the save and pretend it didn't happen.
[89:38.55]You know, and then you get to a possibility where
[89:42.05]Like, you play for like two hours, you delete the save, and then you're like, whoa, guys, checking out this new game.
[89:46.79]Whoa!
[89:47.33]Whoa, did you see that monster?
[89:48.27]Whoa!
[89:48.79]Whoa, cool!
[89:49.47]I haven't seen this before!
[89:50.82]And you have.
[89:51.54]You fucking have.
[89:54.76]Yeah, it turns out that apparently the co-op in this game is relegated to arena battles.
[90:00.40]What?
[90:00.88]Instead of the actual campaign.
[90:02.28]Just based on what we just played.
[90:04.72]Just based on what we just played.
[90:07.47]That's how I understand it.
[90:08.93]So are we going to do Bloody Trapland?
[90:11.79]Yes.
[90:12.21]We're going to go to Bloody Trapland.
[90:13.09]We're going to play the ice level.
[90:15.29]Man, let me just get out of here.
[90:17.55]Again, sorry.
[90:18.29]Thank you for... By the way, thank you for bearing with this shit.
[90:20.51]Like, there's surprisingly fucking, like, 1,700 people still here.
[90:24.81]Like, that... Like... I hope you enjoyed it, but thank you for bearing with it.
[90:31.54]Add it to the list of technical mess streams in the last couple of weeks, which will never fucking happen again.
[90:36.02]I ain't doing this shit again.
[90:36.98]You ain't gonna see this shit again.
[90:39.76]I can fucking promise you that.
[90:44.80]Anyways, let's return.
[90:46.44]Let me just go here.
[90:49.50]Spin this around.
[90:50.36]BRB screen.
[90:53.32]Let's just get out of here.
[90:59.58]Okay.
[91:01.35]Uh-huh.
[91:02.01]Let's open this.
[91:07.35]That game really does mess up the computer after it closes.
[91:10.79]Yeah, it does.
[91:12.57]I don't know why.
[91:14.66]I don't know.
[91:16.48]I can't, like, type.
[91:24.52]Okay, hold on.
[91:25.98]I got to reinstall it real quick.
[91:30.20]It's only 300 megabytes.
[91:31.98]Bloody trap land?
[91:32.64]Bloody trap land.
[91:33.24]Ha, ha, ha, ha, ha.
[91:43.88]Hey!
[91:44.46]Show us refund.
[91:47.12]Show us the refund.
[91:48.56]No, my credit card is on here, I think.
[91:56.63]Okay.
[91:58.75]Yeah.
[92:01.19]Tell us why.
[92:01.85]The game is too difficult.
[92:09.85]Bring it back to Blockbuster.
[92:13.89]Alright, let's do this.
[92:16.93]Maybe in a different world, if I played that game, and the first hour didn't, like, go the way that it did.
[92:23.93]You'd probably like it more in single player.
[92:25.63]I would have probably really liked it.
[92:28.23]According, because A, I wouldn't be there.
[92:31.35]No, but... No, that's not it.
[92:32.65]Because the actual game's there.
[92:35.53]Yeah.
[92:36.53]Well... Except you just have to push A a lot more.
[92:39.04]Yeah.
[92:40.22]To skip through all the dialog.
[92:43.31]Yeah, and whatever.
[92:44.17]People like that shit.
[92:45.05]People like, you know, that's alright.
[92:48.03]I like it depending on the game.
[92:49.47]Like, you're not going to play Mass Effect so you can skip the dialog.
[92:52.73]No.
[92:53.81]But you're going to play this game with the intention of skipping the dialog.
[92:58.34]Yes.
[93:01.92]Finish up Hollow Knight.
[93:02.74]I still want to do that.
