[00:16.35]Oh, Monka, Omega, Monka, Omega, Monka, Omega.
[00:19.84]He leaked it.
[00:22.08]I actually leaked it.
[00:23.22]Ah, Monka, Omega.
[00:25.06]He leaked it.
[00:32.46]Just sitting there.
[00:33.87]Oops, wrong screen.
[00:35.15]Okay, see you later.
[00:38.17]I'll be back.
[00:39.11]I gotta have my two-minute intro.
[00:41.03]Hold on.
[01:20.18]Alright, there we go, that's better.
[01:21.62]Hi guys, how are you?
[01:25.39]Welcome.
[01:28.17]If you probably could guess, today we're gonna do the UFO Arcade update.
[01:33.35]That just dropped a couple weeks ago.
[01:37.05]In the coin game.
[01:39.19]One of our old favorites from earlier in the year.
[01:44.61]Today was Mystery Stream, and there you go, mystery solved.
[01:48.25]We're going back to Coin Game.
[01:49.78]They've added... This is a pretty significant update.
[01:53.90]I'm looking at this right now.
[01:54.86]So... They added... 15 new games.
[02:01.28]This is not just two.
[02:03.68]Oh yeah, we got a new update for you.
[02:04.88]I don't know, like three new games.
[02:06.66]It's 15.
[02:08.58]I don't know how different or good or... We're gonna check it out.
[02:14.19]But that seems like a lot.
[02:16.99]Jerma hates me.
[02:18.69]What are you talking about?
[02:21.27]I don't.
[02:21.85]What?
[02:24.96]Why would you say that?
[02:28.36]Bird game?
[02:29.20]2 out of 16?
[02:30.50]Well... No, that's what we're doing.
[02:33.44]And if there's time left over at the end, depending on how long the update takes us to get through, depending on how many prizes I want.
[02:39.44]And we're also going to play Elf Bowling.
[02:42.14]Because only three people in the pre-stream chat wanted me to.
[02:47.47]Like, that... That's... There's maybe four people in the chat before the stream started.
[02:54.70]They're like, hey, play Elf Bowling Christmas Flash Game.
[02:58.16]Because this is the last stream before Christmas.
[03:00.72]And I'm not streaming on Christmas.
[03:03.08]So... Sure, I'll play Elf Bowling for like ten minutes.
[03:09.89]Also, I want to show you guys the power...
[03:12.45]of the pre-stream chat because this mystery was already solved for people that were here like 30 40 minutes ago I'm gonna give you a poll I'd like you to look at that poll because this is what you could have chosen I want to see what happens please vote for what you think you'd like to see today
[03:44.08]Please vote.
[03:48.26]Let's see what happens.
[03:48.84]That one didn't work.
[03:52.40]Why does that not work?
[03:56.14]Is nothing on this one?
[04:00.72]How?
[04:06.76]What did I do?
[04:07.82]Why is this broken?
[04:13.66]This is- this is not the poll?
[04:15.44]This IS the poll!
[04:19.67]Why is this poll being, like, bro- it's bro- whatever, who cares.
[04:23.97]Point is... You could've... There was Coin Game, there was GTA 5 Casino Update, and there was Nancy Drew on here.
[04:33.28]You could've selected one of those.
[04:35.72]But they chose... Coin Game Update.
[04:42.22]And it's probably what I would have chosen too.
[04:44.22]So, good choice.
[04:47.46]Let's do it.
[04:48.28]It's available.
[04:49.06]It's ready for us right now.
[04:53.00]I'm ready to get addicted.
[04:53.82]Alright, a bunch of kids just drove by in a bus.
[05:00.24]Screaming out the window.
[05:01.44]That bus was going fast.
[05:02.74]Slow down.
[05:09.50]Let's go.
[05:10.34]Let's go.
[05:12.07]Alright, here we go.
[05:12.63]Uh, I think there's a new game mode too, is there?
[05:15.05]Oh shit, I have a saved game!
[05:20.42]Load this one.
[05:24.04]So we played this in July.
[05:28.20]Can I do this?
[05:29.36]Is it... wait, no, survival mode isn't here yet.
[05:36.38]This will delete... yeah, let's go.
[05:41.03]I bought everything here, right?
[05:44.05]That wasn't that long ago?
[05:45.02]No, it wasn't.
[05:45.40]It felt like a long time ago, though.
[05:48.08]Hey, AtmaStarfish, thanks for the five community subs.
[05:55.29]No, that was kind of a long time ago.
[05:56.89]July?
[05:57.29]That was like five months ago.
[06:00.25]That's a long time.
[06:11.30]Are we in?
[06:15.95]The mouse is wrong, too.
[06:18.29]Yeah, it's fine.
[06:20.65]Mouse curse is misaligned.
[06:21.87]It don't matter.
[06:23.19]Now, it has to be aligned now.
[06:26.72]Alright, how's the audio?
[06:27.68]I got 96 bucks.
[06:34.12]What's the UFO?
[06:35.10]Alright, you pawned.
[06:35.92]Okay, I got 100.
[06:36.67]What's my, like, stats?
[06:41.16]Happy birthday, kiddo.
[06:44.86]There it is, the boombox.
[06:46.54]I spent all five months ago trying to get... Where'd it go?
[06:52.93]Okay, I just got really scared.
[06:55.69]Put it in my inventory.
[06:56.51]Just throw it in the trash.
[06:59.93]Alright, let's go to the... You can drive cars, right?
[07:04.31]Why is the game so slow?
[07:09.64]Holy shit, somebody's trying to kill me.
[07:11.32]Like, I am standing in the road.
[07:19.97]Alright, let's go.
[07:21.43]Let's go check out the UFO.
[07:22.53]Wait, I need money.
[07:23.09]Don't I have to call?
[07:24.29]Why do I have a gun?
[07:26.29]Oh, right.
[07:26.71]Okay, it's a rubber band gun.
[07:27.69]I need money.
[07:28.23]I gotta call, um, I gotta call my uncle for money, right?
[07:38.97]How do I get money?
[07:42.15]Total money spent.
[07:43.21]So I spent $41,000.
[07:45.03]How did I win $80,000?
[07:49.06]Oh, there's lottery tickets in this game.
[07:52.62]Holy shit, I forgot.
[07:53.76]I completely forgot about the lottery tickets.
[08:03.66]Alright, well let's go.
[08:04.28]How do I call uncle?
[08:10.12]Uncle Phil.
[08:11.10]How do I ask for money?
[08:14.80]I only have $96.
[08:15.99]That's not enough.
[08:19.23]I gotta remember how to play.
[08:23.17]Just fast travel?
[08:24.65]Can I do it like this?
[08:26.95]Bus passes.
[08:27.71]How much is a bus pass?
[08:28.49]$1.50?
[08:29.41]That's actually not that bad.
[08:34.51]Alright, where am I going?
[08:35.17]I want to go to UFO Point 1.
[08:39.11]Click here to purchase.
[08:42.30]Thank you.
[08:47.92]Got a boss pass.
[08:48.60]Now we're going to go to... One.
[08:54.06]It's very loud.
[08:54.90]Why is that so loud?
[08:57.11]And nothing else is.
[09:00.39]Sound effects.
[09:01.05]Alright, that's probably better.
[09:08.39]Here comes the boss.
[09:11.73]How do we...
[09:14.73]Uh, this is a trash car.
[09:17.47]That's not a bus.
[09:18.41]Where's the bus?
[09:23.19]You are here.
[09:24.47]Where's the bus?
[09:25.31]Oh, okay, there it is.
[09:28.11]Alright, I want to go to... I want to go to 1.
[09:29.67]I want to go to UFO Point.
[09:30.57]Is this going to UFO Point?
[09:34.88]This is going to Barry's Pond.
[09:37.50]No, we're at Barry's Pond.
[09:38.54]How do I choose where I want to go?
[09:41.62]I don't want to give my bus pass.
[09:42.72]Alright, I'll give it, I'll give it, I'll give it.
[09:44.76]Let me in.
[09:45.08]Okay, where are we going?
[09:47.66]Beachfront.
[09:49.30]Oh, okay, get off.
[09:50.44]Do you remember, it's a bus.
[09:53.94]I never took the bus.
[09:59.19]You just get out when you want.
[10:00.25]Right, okay.
[10:00.95]I never took, I took the subway, guys.
[10:04.89]You got, remember, I lived in, I lived in Boston almost my entire life.
[10:12.09]So, I took the subway.
[10:16.29]It's not the same thing.
[10:22.39]I took the T. Like, the T stops.
[10:30.91]The MBTA.
[10:34.97]Buses don't exist in Boston?
[10:38.53]I think they do, but not like you think.
[10:43.57]The C-B-T-A.
[10:54.18]Watch out, watch out!
[10:54.86]Alright, where, I can't, I can't see that far.
[11:04.98]Can I stand up?
[11:11.13]Press E, should I get off now?
[11:13.89]No, we're not there yet.
[11:18.20]That's Larry's arcade.
[11:19.26]I want to go to the UFO.
[11:23.68]The UFO is the arcade, the new one.
[11:28.20]Oh, no, I have to also call my dad for more money.
[11:30.94]Alright, this is home.
[11:36.84]Is my home the gas station?
[11:38.14]How does that make any sense?
[11:41.29]This is a long bus.
[11:43.29]I could have just walked there.
[11:45.01]I have to go to the money-grabber machine.
[11:53.54]Right.
[11:54.02]Shit.
[11:55.04]Well, let's see what I can play with $94.
[11:56.40]This is just actually a real bus.
[12:03.30]Next stop.
[12:05.44]What's after home?
[12:09.40]Mountains.
[12:13.25]This is taking me all over the whole city.
[12:24.96]You're gonna get motion sick?
[12:26.22]Why am I gonna get motion sick?
[12:31.36]I don't think this was even in the game last time I played.
[12:33.98]Alright, UFO Pier is coming up next.
[12:47.76]Nobody's getting on or off the bus.
[12:49.20]This is kind of depressing.
[12:51.50]The newspaper behind you says Jeremy.
[12:54.02]No, it says Jerry's.
[12:54.96]Alright, coming up.
[12:57.56]Here we go.
[12:57.94]UFO Pier.
[13:02.70]How does a bus work?
[13:05.10]It drives around in a circle and lets people off at designated stops.
[13:09.30]You can then get on the bus or get off at any of those designated stops as long as you have a ticket to get on.
[13:16.09]This is Half-Life 2.
[13:27.61]It kind of is.
[13:28.51]This is how long it takes in Half-Life 2 to go.
[13:33.92]The only difference is we're not getting the voiceovers.
[13:38.64]Fuck the Drew crew, bro.
[13:39.98]Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey!
[13:44.94]You don't come to the Drew crew turf and talk like that.
[13:49.60]What?
[13:50.13]Jesus!
[13:53.22]That actually scared the shit out of me.
[13:55.92]I was just here.
[13:57.58]We did a full circle.
[14:00.30]Where's the UFO?
[14:08.49]What?
[14:10.85]What was the point of taking the bus if we just went around in a full circle?
[14:15.10]Can I get off?
[14:22.53]He just called Half-Life 2 Half-Life 1.
[14:24.61]I did?
[14:27.99]No, you get on!
[14:28.67]This is like a train in Half-Life 2 that you... Or is that Half-Life 1?
[14:32.19]That happens in both.
[14:40.92]That happens in both.
[14:41.98]Yeah.
[14:42.48]What are you talking about?
[14:49.10]It happens to both of you, fake gamer.
[14:51.52]There it is!
[14:53.64]Look at, it's so glorious.
[14:55.48]Look at how glorious that is.

[15:35.84]There's go-karts.
[15:40.30]Holy shit, it's awesome.
[15:43.96]What are the new games?
[15:44.98]Butterfly Catcher?
[15:48.10]Oh, you gotta do the thing you do when you go into every new arcade.
[15:50.47]You don't spend any money.
[15:51.49]You just walk around and go, oh, look at this one.
[15:54.39]Alright, what about this next one?

[16:47.13]I hope Jupiter's not here.
[16:52.07]Lava lamp.
[16:53.31]Fun capacitor.

[20:22.83]Oh my god.
[20:24.67]That's like six.
[20:29.78]Imagine seeing somebody do this.
[20:32.22]I feel like you'd draw a crowd at this point.
[20:37.96]I think that's the end of the tower.
[20:41.59]Oh my god, it's not... It's almost as tall as me.
[20:48.00]I'm wasting money.
[20:48.96]Oh shit, I am wasting money, you're right.

[21:14.38]We got six.
[21:15.40]Who cares?
[21:15.80]Ooh, money machine!
[21:18.24]Let's go!
[21:33.07]Just like at the carnival.
[21:38.23]This isn't a restroom.
[21:40.33]I'm not going to the bathroom in here.
[21:47.22]Quick, get the bits.
[21:48.42]Get the hundred.
[21:50.06]Oh, monkaOMEGA.
[21:54.66]Alright, let me out.
[22:25.68]I'm thrown out of here instantly.
[22:33.83]Throw it like onto the track.
[22:35.11]Alright, I'll get those later.
[22:39.56]Let me go upstairs.
[22:40.08]I wanna see what's upstairs.
[22:48.40]What is up here?
[22:50.26]Laser zone?
[22:55.00]What is Laser Zone?
[22:59.44]Welcome to Laser Zone.
[23:00.58]It's five bucks for... It's laser tag.
[23:02.88]Alright, what else is over here?
[23:08.66]Okay, you just can go down to the go-karts.
[23:11.59]And that's what's... Alright, let's go.
[23:12.75]Let's do laser tag first.
[23:14.21]Dude, this is a pretty substantial update.
[23:22.21]How do...
[23:25.95]What is going on?
[23:26.53]I can't... I'm not... You gotta go for the base.
[23:35.02]Go for the base.
[23:35.98]Go for the base.
[23:39.02]Here's the actual pro tip when you're playing anything.
[23:42.50]Any laser tag.
[23:43.95]Sneak around back to the base.
[23:45.21]Usually it's a dome.
[23:46.33]That's all the way in their corner.
[23:48.07]And just hold down the trigger.
[23:50.37]Just at the base.
[23:52.19]You'll be number one on the leaderboards every time.
[23:53.51]Don't even fight anybody.
[23:56.40]Do not fire at any other people.
[23:57.80]Use all your ammo only for the small little light dome that's in their base.
[24:04.42]It's funny because people will just ignore you.
[24:08.70]You'll get 100% ignored.
[24:14.69]Where's my ammo?
[24:19.49]How do I get ammo?
[24:25.41]Where's ammo?
[24:27.37]Oh, recharge station.
[24:28.34]Here we go.
[24:29.94]Alright, let's do it.
[24:35.36]But yeah, a typical laser tag game is about, I don't know, maybe 15 minutes.
[24:39.66]You could spend a full 13 and a half minutes.
[24:41.64]As long as you sneak into the back of their base, you'll have like 60 million points.
[24:46.05]And when they print out the scorecard showing how awesome everybody was, you'll be... You'll be like... Insanely... You'll be so out of reach.
[24:54.35]Let me do it now.
[24:57.46]Well, these people... There's no... I don't think there is a base.
[25:05.57]No, no, no!
[25:08.29]Roughhousing!
[25:09.17]I would have just got yelled at.
[25:11.79]A whistle would have just gotten, like, blown.
[25:15.47]It is still so loud, though.
[25:16.72]I have to, like, do it manually again.
[25:28.75]Where are they?
[25:29.15]Are they dead?
[25:33.49]Got them both.
[25:36.81]Oh, I got a 2... Alright, that's a 2.0 KD.
[25:41.65]That's not bad.
[25:43.07]I just got 400 tickets for doing that.
[25:49.50]Holy, that's a lot.
[25:53.06]I'm doing that again.
[25:54.70]This time I'm going to try as hard as I can.
[25:58.66]I understand the game now.
[25:59.38]Let's go.
[26:03.08]It's time to be the very clear adult that shouldn't be in there that's killing everybody.
[26:08.55]You know what I mean?
[26:09.41]That's like tagging everybody.
[26:12.35]There's some dad that's just going overboard and just like, Got you!
[26:15.25]Got you!
[26:16.11]Got you!
[26:18.15]Got you!
[26:19.66]Oh, I got you through the wall.
[26:21.52]Yeah, you're dead.
[26:21.96]It's like, Jesus, come on, dad.
[26:25.72]Fucking relax.
[26:26.86]No, no, you have to go back.
[26:29.74]Sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint, sprint!
[26:32.38]Got you!
[26:41.15]Call your hits.
[26:43.47]Yeah, this is annoying older kid, or dad that's going too hard.
[26:50.89]This is also the dad that when he comes out of this, he has a full band of sweat on his head.
[27:02.56]Do a laser tag stream.
[27:04.24]It actually might be like kind of funny.
[27:10.02]You'd have to find a place that would allow you to do that though.
[27:22.73]Back to spawn!
[27:26.32]Literally spawn camping children.
[27:32.63]It's also the worst when you realize.
[27:34.24]So when you play laser tag, it can be very disorienting.
[27:38.78]There's fog machines, there's loud music, there's lights everywhere.
[27:42.46]Somebody on the other team could just be standing behind you, walking behind you the whole time, going like this to your back.
[27:46.84]And you just have no idea.
[27:48.72]It sucks.
[27:56.75]Because then you'll go look at your score, which a lot of these places, like I said, they do a printout, and it shows you your accuracy, and it looks like times hit.
[28:04.70]680.
[28:04.72]And you look at the person next to you, and you're like, what did you give times hit?
[28:09.02]Oh, four.
[28:11.00]Oh, what the fuck?
[28:13.41]Game over.
[28:20.78]How many tickets is that?
[28:23.22]Um, guys, this is where you farm the tickets, is right here.
[28:25.72]We're getting that hoverboard.
[28:26.82]Alright, well, I'll come back.
[28:27.90]18 KD.
[28:31.34]Nice job, Dad.
[28:33.45]Let's do the, uh, go-karts.
[28:47.95]Nice!
[28:55.05]See, look.
[28:55.77]Little Doug.
[28:57.81]Oh fuck.
[29:02.12]You know what always scared me about this?
[29:03.50]Anytime you went to a place that had go-karts, the staff, for some reason, would just be walking around.
[29:14.36]Like on the track and shit.
[29:17.65]And I'd always be so scared to drive fast, because, like, somebody would just be walking by, it's like, oh, shit, that person, that's a, they don't care.
[29:23.06]That's just a staff member.
[29:25.08]I see them, like, 300 feet away, they're, like, moving.
[29:27.26]Yeah, they'd be like, they'd be like a guy smoking a cigarette, like, right there.
[29:48.82]Is this how you drive?
[29:50.74]No, this is not an indicator of how I drive.
[30:01.92]And it always was so annoying because when you knew you were on your last lap, you'd see the worker come and close the gate.
[30:08.70]And you're like, no, don't close the gate!
[30:10.52]And you have to go the other way.
[30:11.66]There's a separate way you have to go to put the cards back.
[30:16.33]Still in last place.
[30:17.21]I didn't even know this was a competition until five seconds ago.
[30:23.13]Am I on one wheel?
[30:44.85]I wish I had a controller.
[30:50.80]Oh, that was a tight turn.
[30:51.92]That was a tight turn.
[30:54.92]He had a red shell.
[30:57.44]Dude, how have they not made a game that was... You know those VR experiences, how they're all stupid?
[31:05.15]Come check out the VR experience where you get like a little laser gun and the polygons are five times bigger than they should be.
[31:12.06]Why not have a Mario Kart-style VR experience?
[31:16.67]Where there's like 12 seats, everyone's in a car, and it moves around, there's feedback, and you're actually in like a Mario Kart-style race.
[31:26.55]That exists.
[31:27.51]Oh, I want to play it.
[31:29.07]Where do I play that?
[31:29.71]I have to come in first place eventually here.
[31:35.50]Not now, though.
[31:35.92]I just want to check it out.
[31:37.32]They literally do that in Japan.
[31:38.40]Are you serious?
[31:40.96]What?
[31:52.43]Japan seriously is that one place on Earth where they seem to just do everything better than everybody else for some reason.
[31:59.65]You know what I mean?
[32:00.13]Oh, yeah, we have arcades here in America.
[32:03.44]Yeah, yeah, we do.
[32:06.76]Oh, they're really fun.
[32:08.22]Sometimes you can play Mortal Kombat 3.
[32:10.54]Oh, no, you can't.
[32:15.20]Sorry.
[32:15.72]Both of the coin slots have been taped over because the machine's broken.
[32:20.07]You wanna play the new Halo game where you can shoot as Master Chief?
[32:24.57]Go.
[32:24.87]Good luck.
[32:25.65]There's always four people sitting in there.
[32:27.55]And they're part of the same four friends that came.
[32:30.91]And they're not leaving that booth.
[32:32.03]They never get out.
[32:32.95]Until they, like, beat the game.
[32:37.95]I feel like this place is in Japan where I can put on a headset and eat food, but not in real life, but I still get full of nutrition and stuff.
[32:47.46]Also, very, very, very important.
[32:51.54]When are arcades gonna implement the old school Super Nintendo Mario comes up and says, It's time for somebody else to play.
[32:59.14]Remember that shit when you used to go to GameStop?
[33:01.64]Or like... Why don't they do that?
[33:06.50]Those of you that don't know, in every GameStop, in most video game stores or boutique stores or whatever, there was always a Super Nintendo or PlayStation 1 in the corner that was just a demo.
[33:15.71]You could just play various games.
[33:18.43]If you stayed on that...
[33:20.62]For more than 15 to 20 straight minutes, Mario would come on.
[33:24.60]It would go to a black screen.
[33:25.72]Mario would appear and go, Thank you.
[33:27.86]Next person in line, please.
[33:30.56]Yes, it did.
[33:30.98]That happened.
[33:33.14]And that person would have to leave.
[33:34.27]Otherwise, it would look like a total asshole.
[33:38.39]Yes, that happened.
[33:39.07]Yes, it did.
[33:39.71]It's real.
[33:40.23]I'm making that up.
[33:46.79]You're paying money, though, to play that one.
[33:49.97]Yeah, but I got money I want to pay too.
[33:56.95]Well, they have more than one machine then.
[33:58.43]Alright, let's do this one.
[34:00.51]I'm going for it.
[34:01.03]How much does this one cost?
[34:01.79]Two bucks.
[34:02.19]That's a lot.
[34:05.53]First fucking try.
[34:06.45]That's how we do a first try jackpot.
[34:09.97]I'll take a first try jackpot.
[34:12.14]Thank you.
[34:13.14]Everybody show up.
[34:13.96]Everybody, that's me you're talking to.
[34:15.56]That's me you're talking to.
[34:22.28]Let's do it again.
[34:24.50]These are my tickets.
[34:25.12]Get the fuck out of here.
[34:27.82]Again.
[34:28.38]I'll never get it again.
[34:28.90]Spin again.
[34:29.16]Yeah, it's like laggy.
[34:29.66]Again.
[34:30.96]Again.
[34:52.79]What's the jackpot at now?
[35:01.60]Fuck, he's gonna chase that high all night.
[35:09.34]I'll take another jackpot!
[35:13.74]That's two!
[35:28.68]He's just lucky.
[35:32.38]I don't think he is.
[35:33.34]I don't think he is.
[35:36.09]I think he's got the skill to be able to get a... How many tickets are underneath me?
[35:45.89]A lot.
[35:46.93]I'm gonna trip on these.
[35:53.74]Is money laundering going on in here?
[35:55.14]No, there's no money laundering.
[35:56.76]I don't do that.
[35:59.30]Here's the problem with this machine, though.
[36:01.20]You'll get so frustrated playing this machine.
[36:03.52]Typically, this is how you do it.
[36:04.58]You put your money in, you wait.
[36:05.84]Okay, go around.
[36:07.40]Go around.
[36:09.71]Gah, I missed.
[36:11.29]But you'll do this ten times in a row and get so frustrated that you try to catch it instantly right when you activate and put your money in like this.
[36:20.49]Fuck!
[36:20.71]Let's go again, again.
[36:34.23]I am unstoppable.
[36:38.55]What?
[36:39.63]Did I get two in a row?
[36:42.45]That's it.
[36:42.87]I did it.
[36:43.19]I did do it.
[36:44.03]I did it.
[36:46.98]Security?
[36:49.16]Why is this guy... Is this guy going to explode?
[36:52.32]What's going on?
[36:53.08]Why is this person going to explode?
[36:55.92]Get this person...
[36:57.92]THIS PERSON'S A BOMB!
[36:59.56]THIS PERSON'S GONNA EXPLODE!
[37:03.02]WHAT THE FUCK?!
[37:05.60]GET OUTTA THERE!
[37:07.02]GET THE BOMB OUT!
[37:07.70]GET HIM OUT!
[37:14.71]Ooh, what about my tickets?
[37:39.24]It's a sparkler.
[37:41.36]Whatever.
[37:45.75]I'm gonna get kicked out of the casino.
[37:56.21]I'm gonna get kicked out of the casino.
[38:03.23]No, I can't do that right now.
[38:07.03]Did the game crash?
[38:08.95]Do it again.
[38:11.48]Hey Jeff, thanks for the five community subs.
[38:33.31]I can't lose!
[38:39.24]I can't lose!
[39:09.33]Alright, alright, alright, alright.
[39:10.45]Let me count.
[39:10.97]Let me see my winnings.
[39:20.20]Get it out of here.
[39:20.84]No.
[39:21.40]Look, the jackpot keeps going up.
[39:24.14]You think I'm not going to get that hoverboard?
[39:25.34]Are you serious?
[39:25.82]Let's go count the tickets.
[39:29.53]Out of my way.
[39:37.93]That's 4,000 tickets already.
[39:39.63]You don't think I'm going to get 100,000?
[39:42.54]Ooh, what's this one?
[39:43.22]How much money do I have?
[39:44.10]94.
[39:44.16]Cool.
[39:44.36]Let's start over here.
[39:44.88]Right here.
[39:45.26]This sounds good.
[39:45.62]How do you play this one?
[39:48.08]How does this one go?
[39:49.02]Just toss it.
[39:49.34]You throw the ball.
[39:49.80]Cool.
[39:50.06]This sounds fun.
[39:50.42]I'm going to do it right now.
[39:51.12]That's fun.
[39:51.36]Let's go.
[39:55.72]Oh, I'm going to be obsessed with this.
[40:06.01]I'm gonna be... I'm... I... I... Just toss it, forehead.
[40:14.29]I get absolute... You don't think I'm gonna do this one again?
[40:16.09]Absolutely.
[40:18.23]How many do I need?
[40:18.83]How many points do you actually need to win the super jackpot?
[40:32.02]Shit.
[40:45.05]Again.
[40:48.77]I did it!
[40:49.17]270 tickets.
[40:53.13]Again, I'm going to try to get more than once.
[40:58.52]It's only 200?
[40:58.84]Yeah, I mean, come on.
[41:00.06]What's this jackpot?
[41:03.74]Uh-oh.
[41:21.32]I almost just soft-locked it.
[41:22.68]Yeah, that was close.
[41:24.52]Oops.
[41:25.82]Oh, god damn it.
[41:26.92]I really didn't mean to do that.
[41:28.56]I went too high.
[41:32.03]What?
[41:32.23]Like you've never done that before?
[41:34.31]Please.
[41:38.49]I got it again.
[41:38.93]I mean, no.
[41:45.48]You've never accidentally tried to throw something in one of these things and it just bounces back and hits you in the chest?
[41:51.08]That does happen.
[41:56.01]That's never happened to you?
[41:58.63]You've never been playing like the football game or the throw the thing, toss the thing and you go a little too hard and it bounces back and hits you in the chest?
[42:07.49]You know the throw the football through the holes?
[42:11.14]You've never missed the one you're trying to hit, the little one at the very bottom and it bounces back and hits you in the face?
[42:17.42]I got it again.
[42:30.28]You're taking the I'm an idiot too far.
[42:35.26]I feel like we've been to different arcades.
[42:42.09]I'm talking, those of you, everybody, everybody over the age of like 28 in the chat right now.
[42:48.16]This is like probably, I don't know, probably eight of you.
[42:51.44]You remember playing the throw the ball, you had to like throw it hard because the shit was broken half the time.
[42:58.12]Throw the ball into the hole and it wouldn't go in so you had to throw it kind of hard and it would bounce back and hit you in the stomach.
[43:18.44]Hole in the sign?
[43:19.20]Oh, shit, you're right.
[43:21.91]Hole in the sign, hole in the sign, hole in the sign.
[43:24.95]I once bounced a basketball at the top of the cage in the hoop game and smashed myself in the face and started crying.
[43:29.81]Thank you.
[43:31.15]Thank you for explaining how this happens.
[43:34.09]I don't think I can make that.
[43:43.99]Ah, guys, I don't think that's possible.
[43:45.29]Is it?
[43:49.81]Fuck, it might be possible.
[43:57.04]It's gonna be possible.
[44:05.66]Shit.
[44:07.17]Stop wasting throws.
[44:08.37]It's alright, I have 84 dollars.
[44:11.69]Yeah, I'm the guy that walks into the arcade with 100 dollars.
[44:27.44]A little higher.
[44:31.72]This is gonna kill me.
[44:39.18]More power, I'm holding it down as far as I can go.
[44:50.86]I might have to come back to this.
[44:54.80]Give a shot, put a bowling ball.
[44:57.22]No, because that's dangerous and stupid.
[45:04.87]I'm not gonna hit this.
[45:07.89]Aim di- wait, like... That's- no, it doesn't do anything.
[45:13.15]You can't bounce it.
[45:13.85]What happened?
[45:25.78]Where'd it go?
[45:27.97]Oh, alright.
[45:36.40]I'm never gonna get it.
[45:37.34]I'm never gonna get it.
[45:38.00]Leave.
[45:38.88]Maybe I'll try it later.
[45:39.82]Another day.
[45:43.60]Alright, what's next?
[45:46.50]I wanna play it though.
[45:47.30]Alright.
[45:48.68]It's this one.
[45:49.64]Aye, this one's fun.
[45:50.28]This is when you throw a bunch of, uh, ping- Jesus.
[45:59.53]That's gonna happen every time in the... Now, there is strategy with this one.
[46:06.32]What you do is you scoop up all of them.
[46:08.56]There's usually about... Maybe 20 or 30?
[46:12.46]You get as many as you can hold in your arms, and you just... Toss them all up at the exact same time over here, and you... Just that's... You'll hit most of them.
[46:25.05]It's gonna do that loud song again, isn't it?
[46:27.09]Alright, here we go.
[46:29.88]Come on, get them all!
[46:55.54]Do it again.
[46:56.64]I can get it.
[47:00.36]He's cheating.
[47:02.02]How am I cheating?
[47:04.67]Get the ones in the front first.
[47:06.69]Get it.
[47:07.11]That's it.
[47:07.47]I got them all.
[47:23.17]That one wasn't even hard.
[47:25.13]Bonus round.
[47:29.17]Shit.
[47:30.57]Okay, that's gonna... I gotta get a... You gotta do the bonus first.
[47:35.87]First part's not hard.
[48:07.49]Get it!
[48:08.41]Get this last one!
[48:09.43]Get the last one, please!
[48:11.01]Get the last one!
[48:12.23]Go with the front row first.
[48:18.90]God damn it.
[48:20.08]I have to...
[48:40.26]That's a lot for me.
[48:44.44]So what's the strategy?
[48:45.94]Middle out?
[48:46.46]You think?
[48:46.88]Like, middle out.
[48:47.47]Middle out?
[48:48.47]Just throw fast.
[48:49.43]Alright, I'm just gonna spam him.
[49:12.59]Spam.
[49:13.05]Spam.
[49:13.59]Spam.
[49:13.97]Bounce.
[49:14.69]Bounce.
[49:15.29]Bounce.
[49:16.80]That shit's impossible.
[49:18.82]It's just not even possible.
[49:19.66]I don't think it's even possible.
[49:21.72]It's going to take insane luck.
[49:23.50]It's not even possible.
[49:31.31]What about off the edge?
[49:32.99]I mean, it doesn't really do much.
[49:37.47]Try it one more time.
[49:38.83]That's it.
[49:43.55]Final attempt.
[49:47.59]And then moving on to down the bot, whatever it's called.
[49:51.67]There you go.
[49:52.45]You can't do it.
[49:56.34]It's not possible.
[49:59.18]Whatever.
[50:00.08]I'm getting a lot of tickets though.
[50:14.58]Okay, alright, let's move on.
[50:20.91]Nice, alright, here we go.
[50:23.45]Here's one of the games I'm talking about, guys.
[50:26.67]If you've ever played this before, you whip balls at these things.
[50:47.00]I gotta get this better.
[50:47.74]I can do this better.
[50:48.38]I can do this better.
[50:51.08]I can do that better.
[50:51.74]500 will go home.
[50:56.25]I think.
[50:57.01]Yeah.
[50:58.45]500 points will go home.
[51:10.68]They're already down.
[51:13.40]They can't go down anymore.
[51:20.29]How's that worse than last time?
[51:24.33]It got... It fucked up.
[51:31.78]Aim for the one that has red light.
[51:33.26]Yeah, that's what I was doing.
[51:38.98]I have... This is gonna be worse.
[51:41.68]Ho ho!
[51:44.16]Ho ho!
[51:54.39]That, no, you gotta, you gotta... Okay, I got it.
[51:58.27]I got plenty of money.
[52:01.47]I'm bad.
[52:03.45]Alright.
[52:04.70]Sure.
[52:06.62]Ho ho!
[52:08.88]Ho ho!
[52:13.68]Ho ho!
[52:16.64]Ho ho!
[52:18.97]Ho ho!
[52:20.15]Ho ho!
[52:22.69]Ho ho!
[52:25.64]That's not bad.
[52:26.12]That wasn't bad.
[52:27.39]That wasn't bad.
[52:28.69]380?
[52:31.49]Down as many as possible.
[52:32.73]The light is bait.
[52:34.05]Is that true?
[52:35.33]Is it light bait?
[52:44.34]Ho ho!
[52:47.12]The light is bait.
[52:52.39]Ho ho!
[52:58.20]Alright, light is bait.
[53:01.82]I'm going for just a full-on hit every single... If you hit every single throw, you'll get 500.
[53:06.54]That should work.
[53:07.66]Ho ho!
[53:11.46]Ho ho!
[53:16.79]Ho ho!
[53:21.53]Ho ho!
[53:23.07]Ho ho!
[53:24.15]Ho ho!
[53:32.25]Shoot between them.
[53:33.07]I need more sensitivity.
[53:40.71]Don't go for the top ones.
[53:41.67]Bad idea.
[53:42.07]Let's try to... I need more sensitivity.
[54:05.18]I'm gonna get stuck here.
[54:06.60]I'm gonna get stuck here.
[54:08.30]It's okay.
[54:08.78]I'm gonna do it.
[54:11.24]I need to get at least 400 or something.
[54:15.46]Ho ho!
[54:17.62]Ho ho!
[54:19.46]Ho ho!
[54:22.59]Ho ho!
[54:26.21]Ho ho!
[54:27.81]Ho ho!
[54:29.95]Ho ho!
[54:35.98]Alright.
[54:37.38]I keep getting stuck in the same spot.
[54:39.56]Go for doubles only.
[54:42.11]Let me see.
[54:50.81]That's not reliable.
[54:53.01]No, doubles ain't reliable.
[54:54.17]Check that.
[54:55.16]Doubles ain't reliable.
[55:00.56]No, doubles ain't reliable.
[55:05.82]Unfortunately.
[55:11.86]Doubles just kind of happen.
[55:13.40]Try the second row.
[55:14.52]Maybe just farm doubles in the second row.
[55:16.20]Maybe we'll see.
[55:23.93]Okay, you can do... We're only going to do the bottom and the... Okay, we're going farming doubles.
[55:38.92]What kind of a psycho do you have to be?
[55:40.12]Alright, let's try it for real this time, and then I'm moving on.
[55:43.28]We're going to skee-ball next.
[56:03.36]What?!
[56:04.72]Ho-ho!
[56:06.40]Ho-ho!
[56:09.72]That's too hard to do that.
[56:11.04]I need more sensitivity.
[56:13.56]Alright.
[56:13.96]Last one.
[56:14.48]Finally.
[56:14.94]Actually the last one.
[56:15.50]I'm just gonna go try as many as I can.
[56:17.87]This is bait.
[56:18.57]It's fine.
[56:19.49]Here we go.
[56:42.93]I don't care.
[56:43.37]I don't care.
[56:43.73]I don't care.
[56:44.29]It's the sensitivity.
[56:46.49]It's got to be higher.
[56:47.33]I can't move.
[56:48.17]Just no.
[56:48.55]No, get me out.
[56:49.03]Get me out.
[56:49.75]Get me out of here.
[56:55.17]No, if I increase sensitivity, I'll stay there for another three hours.
[56:57.83]Sure.
[57:10.38]Is there sensitivity?
[57:15.90]I don't know.
[57:16.28]There is no sensitivity.
[57:17.14]Oh well.
[57:21.24]Let's go.
[57:25.20]This is just original skee-ball.
[57:26.62]I think this one's in the old game, but this one's a... It has a... Yeah, this one has a space theme to it.
[57:42.05]Ah.
[57:45.79]Skee-Ball is one of those games that you seriously get... I get... Oh, Jeremy, that's never happened to me in an arcade before.
[57:52.03]No way.
[57:52.75]When I play Skee-Ball, that never happens to me.
[57:56.35]Yes, it does.
[58:00.88]No, Jeremy, I've never rolled a little too hard for it to hit the back and go for it.
[58:04.42]What are you for?
[58:13.68]No, Jerma, I've never walked over to the side and placed every single ball in the hundred.
[58:18.69]No, Jerma, I'm such a good boy!
[58:38.72]Not everyone's as bad as you, Boober.
[58:41.98]You guys are describing a technique that I did maybe when I was 11.
[58:45.35]I wasn't a boomer when I was 11.
[58:48.35]50 points.
[58:48.95]I can do better than that.
[59:03.04]I can do much better than that.
[59:07.60]11-year-old boomer.
[59:10.20]Everything's a boomer.
[59:16.52]Guys, I'm drinking a coffee right now.
[59:18.18]It's pretty good.
[59:18.74]That's Boomer Coffee.
[59:22.52]I drink my... This coffee's better.
[59:25.19]Oh, okay.
[59:29.23]Guys, I drive a Honda Civic.
[59:31.15]That's a Boomer Car.
[59:32.53]Oh.
[59:33.63]Okay.
[59:36.05]Okay.
[59:41.60]Guys, I buy Charmin Ultra Soft toilet paper.
[59:44.72]That's a boomer toilet paper.
[59:46.86]I use it every day.
[59:48.50]Okay.
[59:51.16]Come on.
[59:59.81]Hope you're having a good day.
[60:03.23]I am.
[60:03.67]Hey, thanks.
[60:06.79]Hope you're having a good day, too.
[60:13.22]I gotta get at least 100 before I leave.
[60:20.07]What's my favorite ice cream?
[60:22.75]Mom's Bacon Cookies.
[60:25.37]From Baskin Robbins.
[60:26.51]It's the best ice cream ever, and I think it no longer exists.
[60:32.35]I tweeted about it, and they deleted it off their menu.
[60:36.00]That tweet, by the way, had like 600,000 impressions on it.
[60:40.30]Why would you get rid of that ice cream after somebody that literally has hundreds of millions of people viewing their Twitter?
[60:46.08]How could you do something like that?
[60:52.35]Impressions.
[60:56.37]How many impressions did that get?
[60:58.27]I don't know.
[60:58.75]Who gives a shit?
[61:03.49]You know what impressions means, guys?
[61:05.23]And I'm gonna give you some fucking influencer lingo here, those of you that don't know.
[61:10.07]That is actually how many times people may have even just scrolled by and not given a shit about the thing that you said.
[61:18.38]Yeah, but they still went by it!
[61:20.92]Okay.
[61:31.23]Fucking boomers, am I right?
[61:41.33]I have to get 100.
[61:41.99]Come on.
[61:45.33]I can't find mom's bacon cookies.
[61:51.20]I know, it's actually unfortunate.
[61:52.72]It actually is.
[61:58.34]He's trying to be... It probably was, like, seasonal.
[62:04.75]And I know I'm going to say this, but imagine having seasonal ice cream.
[62:12.56]Is that real?
[62:19.32]It's not like pineapples are not in season.
[62:22.03]You know what I mean?
[62:22.45]It's ice cream.
[62:32.99]Seasonal pizza.
[62:36.69]I have to get 100.
[62:38.24]Why can I not get 100?
[62:40.42]Pumpkin spice lover is suffering.
[62:46.36]I don't know.
[62:50.24]Okay, I guess I do get it.
[62:51.24]It's like a marketing thing where it's like pumpkin spice during the fall.
[62:54.04]Ooh, warm and spicy and it's warm in your belly.
[62:56.57]Ooh, okay.
[62:59.30]But that pumpkin spice comes out of a bag.
[63:02.22]It's a powder that comes out of a bag.
[63:03.74]It's not like, good thing these pumpkins are in season.
[63:06.74]My fresh pumpkin brains.
[63:08.38]That's, what do you, no.
[63:18.76]Get in there.
[63:24.28]Alright.
[63:24.48]One more.
[63:29.99]I'm gonna go aim down and, yeah, alright, that's the trap.
[63:32.76]I'm gonna aim down.
[63:35.72]And right there.
[63:38.06]A little bit higher.
[63:42.18]Sorting algorithm noise?
[63:47.48]Oh, yeah, I know what you're talking about.
[63:48.94]The things that, yeah.
[63:52.92]Oh, you're killing me.
[63:53.96]Yep.
[63:57.49]Oh, I have to listen to it now.
[63:58.93]Then it goes like... Oh, I have to hear it right now.
[64:01.39]Let's go. ...
[64:28.82]This is gonna be loud as fuck, hold on.
[64:36.25]Sorting algorithms.
[64:42.93]Yes!
[64:57.43]Louder, no, it's too... Here's the best part, here comes the best part, everyone shh, quiet, here comes the best part.
[65:05.63]No, no, not this one, it doesn't, it goes... I'll wick my favorite one.
[65:16.18]No, fuck that one, that one sucks, dumb.
[65:21.78]Where is it?
[65:22.10]Here it comes.
[65:23.38]I think this is the one, this is the one.
[65:27.12]No, no, no, not this one.
[65:28.10]It's one that's in two different sections.
[65:37.38]It's the one coming up next.
[65:39.94]Show it on stream?
[65:40.76]Okay.
[65:45.86]I just want to show you my favorite one.
[65:47.92]All others are not even close.
[65:54.78]Not even fucking close.
[66:03.92]Give me this.
[66:04.62]Where's my source?
[66:17.75]Here it comes.
[66:18.17]Can you see it?
[66:24.69]No, you can't.
[66:30.34]People are going, dude, I don't get it.
[66:37.36]Not that one.
[66:37.90]Not this one.
[66:38.50]Boo!
[66:39.20]Next one, please.
[66:50.78]Not this one either.
[66:51.50]Fuck this one.
[66:52.38]This one.
[66:52.86]Ready?
[66:55.28]Here it comes!
[66:57.70]This one.
[67:09.95]Here it comes!
[67:10.89]The best part!
[67:11.73]It's the best part!
[67:23.39]That was the best part.
[67:26.59]Alright.
[67:27.41]No, fuck that.
[67:28.07]Let's go back to this.
[67:48.63]It's really that sound.
[67:49.85]That's so fucking funny.
[67:52.09]I have to get it in 100 before I do anything.
[68:03.17]I can't know.
[68:03.71]It's lower octave.
[68:14.16]Stop getting tens.
[68:15.22]I'm trying to get 100.
[68:23.72]I'm never going to get 100.
[68:30.92]Jerma, I just joined and the first thing I hear is sorting algorithms.
[68:33.44]Why?
[68:35.76]Hold on.
[68:40.61]I can't even... Somebody just complained about a sorting algorithm?
[68:46.98]I can't hear that right now.
[68:57.73]You've complained about it before, have I?
[69:02.17]That's my favorite sorting algorithm.
[69:03.91]Skee-ball.
[69:05.97]See, here are the packets of data.
[69:09.49]Give me a hundred!
[69:15.91]Oh my fucking god.
[69:23.33]What was wrong with that?
[69:24.21]I can't.
[69:31.52]It's...
[69:49.06]I need a new machine.
[69:49.80]It's definitely the angle.
[69:53.82]It's the angle.
[69:59.37]No, okay.
[69:59.85]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[70:00.55]I got it, I got it, I got it.
[70:01.23]You don't think you've ever hit a hundred in real life?
[70:07.65]Yeah, you gotta go up.
[70:09.23]There's actually a strategy.
[70:10.35]If you... Here's the thing about the hundred.
[70:12.75]When you hit the hundred, you just... You get into the zone.
[70:18.00]And you get two, three, or four hundreds in a row.
[70:20.75]And then for the rest of the night, you'll never hit one more.
[70:30.44]In fact, it might not happen for years.
[70:31.60]I have to hit this.
[70:42.79]This is not this difficult.
[70:47.16]More than that.
[70:47.70]I'm not... I'm just gonna... But the thing is I can't keep the same angle.
[70:50.69]Because the game forces you down.
[70:56.55]Nancy Drew waiting room.
[70:57.81]You had a chance to vote for Nancy Drew and you soiled it!
[71:13.92]Why?
[71:14.78]Can I not do this?
[71:19.28]Why can I not do this?
[71:27.13]Good.
[71:27.59]Done.
[71:32.55]I did it.
[71:34.47]What happened to that?
[71:39.74]Jesus, you suck.
[71:42.58]It... It's not easy to get it in this game.
[71:45.42]It's not easy to do.
[71:49.53]This is so easy.
[71:51.64]It's not.
[71:53.26]It's not easy.
[71:56.02]Ooh, okay.
[71:56.80]At least I heard the noise.
[72:05.44]Let's go cash in the tickets.
[72:07.28]See if I can get a lightsaber.
[72:09.18]What do I have?
[72:09.66]4,397?
[72:09.72]Let's go.
[72:09.94]I tried your...
[72:20.92]Alright, we're almost 10% of the way to the hoverboard.
[72:25.15]I'm just gonna farm that.
[72:26.03]You know I'm gonna farm that.
[72:27.19]Alright, what else we got?
[72:30.69]We're doing full circle, and then we're going middle.
[72:35.57]That one looks cool.
[72:37.16]This was already... This was a 500?
[72:37.94]What?
[72:53.78]Mermaids from Space.
[72:58.79]Mermaids from Space coin pusher.
[73:02.05]5 tickets, 10 tickets.
[73:03.39]You collect these.
[73:04.27]Anything else I need to know?
[73:06.45]Alright, let's go.
[73:10.80]Multi-credit.
[73:11.38]How many credits to load?
[73:12.46]10.
[73:12.48]I have 120 coins.
[73:24.70]This one is... I love this already.
[73:30.06]Oh, I wish... I wish this existed.
[73:33.38]This one, exact one.
[73:34.48]Alright, uh... I got a bonus?
[73:40.20]What do I do?
[73:47.98]Coin pusher.
[73:48.88]Pog.
[73:52.08]Yeah.
[73:53.50]Now this is content.
[73:55.96]This is the content that you came to this stream for.
[74:06.52]There it is.
[74:11.74]Where's the hundred?
[74:12.20]There's a hundred right here.
[74:12.82]I'll get it.
[74:13.14]Here it comes.
[74:20.69]Usually it's quarters and takes forever.
[74:23.49]Yeah, hold.
[74:28.35]Still going.
[74:30.21]Still going.
[74:33.18]Yeah, that was good.
[74:34.52]That was a really good one.
[74:36.46]Right side now.
[74:37.04]Look at all this delicious stuff on the right side.
[74:39.38]Watch this.
[74:43.88]We're gonna get an avalanche right now.
[74:56.05]That's a Burgah Boy tactic?
[74:57.03]Yeah, it is.
[74:58.85]Burgah Boy tactics work, guys.
[75:01.52]People want patience.
[75:02.72]No, no, no.
[75:04.28]You have to use the Burgah Boy technique.
[75:12.96]Just kill it, kill the whole thing Is this Burgah Boy technique or is this bored rich kid?
[75:36.06]I don't know Last push
[75:44.32]Oh!
[75:45.82]1,290 tickets.
[75:47.16]1,300 tickets?
[75:49.06]1,400 tickets!
[75:51.34]Whoa, you just got yourself 1,400 more tickets there!
[75:55.36]And credits.
[75:56.00]Get in the center?
[76:08.56]Oh shit, you're right.
[76:09.52]Look at all that in the center.
[76:10.32]1,400 tickets.
[76:15.32]Cool.
[76:15.54]I like that they're green so I can pretend that it's money.
[76:20.51]Again.
[76:21.97]Last one.
[76:24.13]Last one.
[76:25.71]We're going right in the middle.
[76:33.11]Yeah, the bored, the bored rich kid There are people meticulously crafting their next shot with the quarter that they have Well this dickhead over here is just spamming them It doesn't even matter to him apparently
[76:58.45]This is gonna be a lot.
[77:00.39]Look at this huge wave coming in.
[77:04.22]Spamming is not smart because all the coins land on each other.
[77:08.70]Yeah, I know.
[77:15.77]In fact, I'm doing it wrong.
[77:16.59]You gotta wait till it comes in here.
[77:19.07]I've played these before.
[77:21.05]The best technique is seriously this one right here.
[77:23.26]You wait until it's all the way out, put one down to make it so it's flat.
[77:26.52]Guaranteed flat.
[77:28.76]Sometimes you can get two.
[77:29.94]No more than that, though.
[77:34.40]Maybe three.
[77:40.37]Come on.
[77:41.27]Ooh, that was good.
[77:42.81]That was a good one.
[77:45.67]Get this left side.
[77:48.25]Don't neglect the right side either.
[77:50.09]Gorgoboy wouldn't have wanted this.
[77:59.98]He's not dead.
[78:11.86]This is not what Burgah Boy would have wanted If he were alive This thing is actually mindlessly fun Alright, let's go mindless Look at that wave coming in
[78:41.74]This is what Virga Boy would have wanted.
[78:43.36]Yeah, there it is.
[78:45.22]I got some extra credits.
[78:46.18]Hold on.
[78:49.62]Make these ones count.
[78:55.73]Alright.
[78:57.49]Yes.
[78:58.67]Good.
[79:00.97]I got extra credits.
[79:02.79]Left side, right here.
[79:11.88]I got one more shot right in the middle.
[79:16.10]Knock it down.
[79:20.83]Look at that!
[79:21.41]It's so close!
[79:27.31]I get to keep going.
[79:33.71]This side right here.
[79:35.79]Alright, that's probably it.
[79:38.75]No, I get to keep going.
[79:41.58]Don't have to spend any more money.
[79:42.56]I beat my last record.
[79:43.80]1,400.
[79:43.96]Oh, shit.
[79:55.29]Any more?
[79:56.21]That's it.
[79:57.25]16's, 50's.
[79:57.73]No, no, no.
[79:58.03]They're still pushing.
[80:01.72]Mom, the creepy old man won't get off the coin game.
[80:07.46]Well, son, here's the thing about the creepy old man.
[80:11.02]The creepy old man comes in here every day with $100 and allows the arcade to continue to stay in business and lets them turn a potential profit for them to put another clock tower in the game, in here, in the children casino.
[80:26.59]Alright, here we go.
[80:35.15]Wait, I want to cash these in.
[80:48.62]What am I at?
[80:51.54]12... 14,876.
[80:51.98]I'm almost at the lightsaber.
[80:54.22]Lightsaber's 30.
[80:59.40]Now, don't even look at these middle games yet.
[81:01.94]This one's still at 500.
[81:02.48]Almost.
[81:24.57]You're gonna run out of money?
[81:25.41]It's alright, I'll get some more.
[81:34.34]It's 500 every time.
[81:38.96]This is the best way to farm tickets.
[81:47.08]The building is on fire.
[81:54.04]Oh, I'm out of money.
[81:54.52]Alright, I'm out of money.
[82:01.50]Alright, back to the... I need more money.
[82:04.30]Back to the money.
[82:08.99]Get that sparkler away from me.
[82:10.57]Ah, I told you.
[82:11.11]You guys thought I was acting crazy.
[82:16.99]Go play the check-in game?
[82:18.57]Not yet.
[82:19.69]Not yet.
[82:20.03]I still have to experience all the new content.
[82:24.27]I don't have any money.
[82:26.93]Where's the money machine?
[82:28.41]Upstairs?
[82:28.75]Alright.
[82:34.52]I don't think I ever got the jackpot in the checking game.
[82:38.72]I did not.
[82:51.20]I did?
[82:51.60]No, yeah, no, I did.
[82:52.60]I did.
[82:53.00]That's right, I did.
[82:54.24]Top right corner.
[82:54.88]Oh, right in front of the door.
[83:04.39]I did it twice?
[83:05.05]Yeah, it was like five months ago.
[83:06.63]I don't remember.
[83:09.85]Top right.
[83:10.39]Alright, I got 75 bucks.
[83:15.83]Let me out.
[83:20.87]Where were we?
[83:22.17]Oh.
[83:23.23]That's right.
[83:24.07]Butterfly drop.
[83:24.87]How does this one work?
[83:30.14]Collect.
[83:31.36]Collect all six to win the bonus.
[83:33.24]What's the bonus?
[83:43.63]Oh, you have to put... It's like the hockey one.
[83:45.95]I remember the hockey one.
[83:51.49]This one's actually kind of hard.
[83:52.47]Look at all the Infinity Stones.
[83:59.48]Alright, this one... Those are worth 50 tickets!
[84:05.12]This one could be pretty lucrative.
[84:07.14]This one's bad?
[84:16.61]I mean, it's not the greatest game, but it doesn't mean it can't be lucrative.
[84:24.29]Shit, I missed.
[84:37.96]Shit, this one sucks.
[84:39.87]Oh, this one sucks.
[84:41.33]But I have to get the bonus.
[84:48.15]Get away from me!
[85:00.40]You're using the net upside down.
[85:04.41]I didn't even realize that until right now.
[85:10.35]Depending... Seriously, depending on how lucrative the bonus is.
[85:13.29]We need to see it once.
[85:20.30]How much is this?
[85:20.90]Two bucks? ...
[85:33.04]Holy shit, is this even possible?
[85:48.21]This one sucks.
[85:49.41]Just, I know it sucks, but we... We have to see what the bonus does.
[85:53.75]I'm already two in.
[86:04.08]shake the table no you can't shake anything otherwise you get thrown out there it is okay there's orange and pink got them both alright now we need red blue and yellow that's it alright we're gonna wait for this rotation because there's a this is red I make it I can get the blue got it alright now red and yellow that's it
[86:33.50]Here it comes.
[86:38.12]It broke it up a little.
[86:41.34]It's alright.
[86:46.11]If this bonus is less than 500, I'm never going to play this one again.
[86:49.01]Don't worry.
[86:49.33]You don't have to worry about that.
[86:54.73]Bingo.
[86:55.91]Yeah, I just need blue.
[87:01.45]What do you see 200?
[87:02.11]I don't see 200 anywhere.
[87:03.83]I need red.
[87:06.05]Alright.
[87:17.90]You guys didn't think there was going to be 2,000 tickets for the bonus here.
[87:22.88]That's a lot.
[87:23.86]That is a huge amount.
[87:25.72]That's a ridiculous amount, actually.
[87:28.20]So, I mean...
[87:32.33]That's a lot.
[87:36.53]I feel like I could probably win the spaceship light machine thing.
[87:42.32]Four times before I do this one.
[87:43.64]Alright, let's move on.
[87:49.76]That is a good grab, though.
[87:52.20]That's more than 2,000 tickets.
[87:52.88]Alright, other side.
[87:53.48]We have...
[88:01.57]Ooh, wormhole.
[88:02.83]This one looks cool.
[88:04.67]Two dollars for four credits.
[88:05.71]What, do you drop it through?
[88:08.67]Let's get a good look.
[88:11.48]So you just... Oh, it goes all the way around.
[88:16.56]We gotta count seconds here.
[88:18.80]Okay, let's see.
[88:20.34]From when I click the button.
[88:23.50]One.
[88:24.44]Two.
[88:25.40]Three.
[88:25.64]Alright, it's about three and a half seconds.
[88:27.62]Okay.
[88:30.75]So how long does it take to go around?
[88:31.85]Let's see.
[88:32.74]Jackpot, for instance.
[88:33.52]Ready?
[88:35.94]One.
[88:36.90]Two.
[88:37.86]Three.
[88:38.22]Alright, so ready?
[88:39.38]Check this out.
[88:39.76]I'll get it right here.
[88:40.26]Oh, I'm in the wrong place.
[88:48.94]One.
[88:49.88]Two.
[88:50.04]Alright, it's right there.
[88:58.76]Do it again.
[89:01.84]You start counting at one.
[89:03.41]Why do you start counting at one, not zero?
[89:04.75]I don't know, because I'm not a weirdo?
[89:08.61]Zero.
[89:09.67]One.
[89:10.11]No, it's one, two, three.
[89:11.71]Not zero, one, two.
[89:16.37]See?
[89:17.17]That's a terrible bonus.
[89:19.92]Zero.
[89:21.02]One.
[89:21.94]Two.
[89:22.42]No, it's one, two, three.
[89:27.82]He's not a programmer.
[89:31.80]Who counts like that?
[89:33.16]Nobody counts 0, 1, 2.
[89:34.30]I'll try it.
[89:39.46]I'll try it.
[89:42.26]Alright, I'll try it.
[89:43.36]I'll try it.
[89:44.34]That's the correct way.
[89:45.74]0 is a void.
[89:46.82]It's not even a real number.
[89:47.94]0.
[89:47.96]No.
[89:48.02]0.
[89:51.16]1. 2.
[90:04.36]That's literally untrue.
[90:08.47]So it works, sometimes.
[90:37.06]Alright, maybe I'll change the way I count numbers now.
[90:46.60]Give me my tickets.
[90:52.00]That kid's gonna... Look at how many burn marks are all over this kid.
[90:56.88]What?
[90:58.34]He's got like... You're messed up.
[91:04.06]We're gonna find where your parents are.
[91:06.95]Leave him alone.
[91:08.25]Well, what do you want me to do?
[91:10.77]He's holding it so close to his face, he's burning his face.
[91:14.31]Here we go.
[91:15.73]This is the one I'm talking about.
[91:17.17]Cow machine.
[91:26.07]First try, get it.
[91:26.87]Oh, he... Yeah, I'm gonna clean this whole machine out.
[91:33.63]That's why you don't play this game, ever.
[91:37.51]This thing grips as hard as your grandmother.
[91:45.71]Your grandmother has a real soft grip.
[92:02.51]You gotta distribute the weight.
[92:03.74]I get it.
[92:05.12]Don't grab the head.
[92:05.82]No, no, no.
[92:06.14]You don't grab the head.
[92:06.94]You gotta grab right in the chest.
[92:10.06]Right along the chest to distribute the weight.
[92:15.67]That's not the chest, but I... No.
[92:18.19]I gotta get chest.
[92:19.15]There it is.
[92:19.47]It's lined up perfectly.
[92:26.31]Just gotta get it right in the... Right there where the weight is distributed.
[92:32.06]If this ain't it, this is impossible.
[92:35.49]Look at that distributed weight.
[92:37.23]Come on, it's... what?
[92:42.41]No, no, no, I want to play it, I want to... How am I supposed to do this?
[92:53.06]It's right in the chest, right in the sternum, there it is.
[92:56.94]Get it over there.
[92:59.98]It can't move, so how is it even possible?
[93:11.02]I didn't get anything.
[93:19.73]It's rigged?
[93:21.17]No, it's a motion problem.
[93:28.91]Get it.
[93:32.23]Alright, that's a pretty good grip.
[93:33.69]It's impossible.
[93:42.49]You need to just toss it over here accidentally somehow.
[93:47.78]That might be it.
[93:48.22]Alright, accident.
[93:50.38]Nice.
[93:51.52]Pretty good accident.
[93:58.50]I got one!
[94:00.55]Cool.
[94:01.73]Let's get another one.
[94:06.03]Let's get one so we can give it to somebody here.
[94:13.78]What?
[94:24.17]Throw it on the racetrack.
[94:25.35]Why would I waste a perfectly good cow?
[94:27.93]Throwing it on a racetrack.
[94:30.96]Why would I waste it?
[94:40.49]That's the one.
[94:41.55]That's a perfect grab.
[94:43.88]What?
[94:44.98]That doesn't even make any sense.
[94:47.80]The cow just struggled and got out.
[94:52.17]You have to actually throw it in.
[94:53.83]Like it did last time.
[94:59.57]Quick, get the Pikachu socks.
[95:02.47]They're right there.
[95:03.15]I already got one, so it doesn't matter.
[95:07.37]But I'm going to try... Stop moving around so much.
[95:13.52]Settle.
[95:15.30]Settle.
[95:19.27]Settle.
[95:19.91]Why is it not settling?
[95:29.31]Throw it in there.
[95:29.93]Toss it.
[95:30.37]Throw.
[95:30.73]Throw.
[95:31.07]Throw.
[95:31.39]Throw.
[95:31.73]Throw.
[95:32.05]Throw.
[95:32.33]Throw it in.
[95:32.73]Throw it in.
[95:33.09]Throw it in.
[95:33.53]That's two.
[95:37.27]Oh, that was almost a free one.
[95:39.28]That was almost for free.
[95:40.24]Do it again.
[95:54.59]He's addicted to Mega Milk.
[96:00.71]Oh, I see.
[96:01.25]You're doing it.
[96:01.71]Alright.
[96:02.64]I see what you mean.
[96:05.98]He's addicted.
[96:06.68]He's addicted.
[96:10.74]I want to try to get one for free.
[96:14.70]We need a good bounce on the free one.
[96:20.76]This is a cute game, though.
[96:23.25]Go for the closest one.
[96:25.30]Well, what I'm trying to do is I'm trying to make a pile.
[96:30.70]Jerm is going to be here for four hours?
[96:33.32]No, no, no, no, no.
[96:34.68]More like four minutes.
[96:47.10]Get it in.
[96:47.38]It's almost there.
[96:52.32]Grab it from the butt.
[96:54.57]And then I should be able to toss it in there.
[96:58.08]No, didn't get it.
[96:58.84]I just have to grab it and... No, I have to push it in the head.
[97:02.18]I'm going to push its head down.
[97:04.12]You know what I'm saying?
[97:07.15]Maybe it'll bump it in.
[97:12.89]Get it in there!
[97:16.34]Yes!
[97:17.68]Another one.
[97:18.32]I want more.
[97:26.43]I wonder how much these sell for.
[97:30.41]Oh my god.
[97:31.11]I did it again.
[97:31.83]Another one.
[97:32.31]I want more.
[97:45.77]I gotta move some of these over this way.
[97:47.97]Let's try this guy right here.
[97:53.16]Right in the head.
[97:55.74]Got it.
[98:08.52]I'm being such an asshole.
[98:13.34]Get your presence, man.
[98:15.00]I want to fill it to the brim.
[98:25.91]And then sell them.
[98:30.31]I want to turn.
[98:34.28]Wait, you just have to wait.
[98:35.78]Because I'm currently getting all of them.
[98:43.08]These probably sell for like a hundred bucks each, at least.
[98:45.33]I'm on a roll, yeah.
[98:50.95]What happens if I get them all?
[98:51.69]Like, can I get them all?
[98:56.36]Will they just stack up over here and I can open the floodgates and have just a bunch of cows fly out?
[99:11.06]Some of them are impossible to get though because of where they're located.
[99:15.98]Is this why a Jerma decided to move to Las Vegas?
[99:22.25]For claw machines?
[99:34.08]So you're holding up the line here.
[99:35.36]That's alright.
[99:39.37]Get the first one you tried.
[99:43.01]This one is ready to go.
[99:44.09]Just need to get it right in the chest.
[99:46.77]Right here.
[99:47.45]There it is.
[99:49.08]Go around.
[99:49.58]There we go.
[99:51.18]Get the blue one in the back.
[99:53.90]Blue?
[99:55.32]That's not in here.
[99:58.90]That's the background.
[100:03.70]Mario says it's time for someone else to play.
[100:08.17]And then you just skip skip skip skip skip skip as fast as you can so you hope nobody saw it.
[100:12.78]They did.
[100:13.82]They all did.
[100:23.41]Is there something else buried in here?
[100:32.60]What?
[100:37.88]The mods are doing a good job stopping copy and pasting trolls.
[100:42.46]Yeah, good.
[100:45.38]So, see you later.
[100:48.28]See you next time.
[100:54.75]Is it just, is it so much to ask to want to fill this up and just turn around and just flex?
[101:15.12]Throw it in.
[101:15.54]Ugh, I tell you, it's almost- okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay... I'm good.
[101:21.54]Ready? Watch.
[101:23.54]There we go.
[101:26.54]There it is. Here it is.
[101:29.54]Oh I'm so excited!
[101:30.54]I'm almost as excited as for sorting algorithms.
[101:34.54]Brrrooooop.
[101:50.54]Agh!
[101:54.54]I'm gonna get one more in there.
[101:55.30]One more and then I'm gonna open it up.
[101:56.26]And then I'm gonna turn around and be like, Have at it, kids!
[102:01.50]And they're all gonna be like, Yay!
[102:08.65]You're gonna make a... You're making a riot?
[102:10.67]No.
[102:11.19]What?
[102:18.29]Does it count as a win if I pick the one up that's right there and drop it over the censor?
[102:24.20]I'm sure it does.
[102:24.74]I just have to get one more in here and that's it.
[102:34.61]Look, I went over the double dare line, okay?
[102:36.93]I put enough milk in there to win the family challenge.
[102:42.58]Hold on.
[102:46.35]But I want to do more.
[102:48.65]I just want one more, and then I'm done.
[102:50.83]I want to play it again.
[102:51.67]I just want one more.
[102:52.77]I want to go so far over it that it's just a joke.
[102:57.15]Like, holy shit, man.
[102:58.47]What overkill is this?
[102:59.69]You did it.
[103:00.17]You won.
[103:01.09]But I want to make sure that no one else gets to win as much as I did.
[103:06.76]I want to be on the leaderboard over there.
[103:08.96]Alright, good.
[103:09.48]It's in a good spot.
[103:20.96]Cow leaderboard.
[103:23.82]Come on.
[103:24.48]Oh, I did it!
[103:29.68]It's as many as it can possibly go in there.
[103:33.36]Let's go in and see what we can get.
[103:34.63]I wonder if I win.
[103:37.93]Did I win?
[103:38.45]Oh wow, I won!
[103:52.65]See, the real evil mastermind here thing to do, be to whip out some superglue and, like, superglue the door shut.
[104:03.44]So it's like, there's prizes right there!
[104:05.86]We can't get them!
[104:07.56]The prizes are right there!
[104:21.03]Evil.
[104:21.89]Evil, man.
[104:31.49]Jerma, you need to let go.
[104:32.49]Oh, yeah.
[104:33.13]I said I was going to stop after that.
[104:34.76]It's alright.
[104:38.28]Yeah, that's a cartoon villain scheme.
[104:39.74]Alright, I'm out.
[104:41.36]Let's get our prizes.
[104:50.33]Here.
[104:53.42]Oh no, the prizes are right there!
[105:04.43]I can't get them!
[105:07.97]What are you doing?
[105:13.20]What the hell is it doing?
[105:21.98]Can I, like, go in and reach my hand in there?
[105:25.38]Wait, hold on.
[105:26.04]I have to just jostle.
[105:27.22]I have to just move.
[105:28.98]Yep, there it is.
[105:29.59]Okay.
[105:32.81]No, no, no.
[105:33.05]Don't pick it up.
[105:33.45]I want to get out.
[105:35.13]I want to get out.
[105:35.69]I don't want to pick that up.
[105:39.62]Alright.
[105:42.18]I can try this one.
[105:43.16]This one's, like, right here.
[105:52.94]Alright, that's it.
[105:53.40]That's it.
[105:54.19]It's not softlocked.
[105:55.01]I can pull these ones out.
[105:55.79]Look.
[106:05.30]Alright, there are a couple.
[106:06.76]There are a couple that are softlocked, but I can get them.
[106:09.50]See?
[106:09.70]I just have to pay money.
[106:12.92]No, I don't...
[106:23.89]Jerma, what are you doing?
[106:24.59]I don't want to waste the money.
[106:26.17]Might as well try to grab one.
[106:27.83]Alright, that's good.
[106:31.11]They're both ready.
[106:40.02]Alright, I beat the cow machine.
[106:41.36]Cool.
[106:43.54]Oh, there's more in the middle.
[106:44.82]Alright, hold on.
[106:45.92]Where do we have tickets?
[106:48.58]Get all of them.
[106:51.96]You don't really think I'm going to sit there and get every single cow in that machine.
[106:59.63]Why on Earth would I do that?
[107:02.31]Let's check my inventory.
[107:05.11]Good.
[107:05.69]One, two, three.
[107:07.43]Alright, cool.
[107:08.69]They didn't despawn.
[107:09.39]I have them.
[107:11.47]Oh, I want to get a Mr. Potato Head.
[107:12.63]How do I do this?
[107:13.71]Alright, right.
[107:14.11]It's from the middle.
[107:14.65]I can get one of these.
[107:15.15]That's just a win.
[107:15.65]I have 20,000 tickets.
[107:19.35]I need 80,000 more.
[107:23.42]Do this one first.
[107:28.73]Okay.
[107:35.71]Here we go.
[107:46.15]You can only count to three.
[107:47.95]Not enough coins.
[107:48.59]What are you talking about?
[107:49.17]Oh.
[107:53.22]Hey, I have something for you.
[107:59.62]This is for you.
[108:01.82]Come here.
[108:02.45]This is less dangerous.
[108:06.83]Get over here.
[108:07.83]This is for you.
[108:08.95]This is for you.
[108:10.81]It's less dangerous.
[108:14.07]Here.
[108:15.55]Oh, he fell downstairs and he hit his mouth.
[108:23.24]Oh, I'm sorry about that, kid.
[108:25.42]I'm sorry.
[108:26.34]He's running.
[108:31.97]Even when a kid, when somebody cries, it's like... And it gets louder.
[108:44.07]Yes.
[108:48.45]You're mocking him.
[108:50.55]I remember when I used to cry.
[108:52.99]I would do this thing, and a lot of people do this.
[108:56.35]When something happens that's so traumatic.
[109:00.57]Something like, oh, I bumped my hand and it hurt.
[109:03.60]You start instantly crying.
[109:05.22]Insanely hard.
[109:06.76]So no noise is coming out.
[109:10.00]So you have this face.
[109:12.97]Like this.
[109:13.47]Should I turn the camera on for this?
[109:26.41]So you have this face, right?
[109:29.10]That looks like this.
[109:31.18]Like, for instance, bump my hand real hard.
[109:32.64]Ready?
[109:33.10]Like... And then crying happens.
[109:48.13]Sometimes it's really delayed.
[109:53.10]Here comes an edit.
[109:54.48]Who cares?
[109:57.05]Nice hair, hippie.
[109:57.89]Ban that person for life, please.
[110:02.54]And you can always tell, like, oh, no, you, like, bumped your knee.
[110:06.02]Oh, shit.
[110:07.68]Here I... Here, I see that face.
[110:09.96]And, like, it's... You know it's coming.
[110:32.15]You have good hair?
[110:32.85]Hey, thanks.

[111:20.03]I don't want to say that next part.
[111:21.21]I don't want to say the next part.

[122:35.51]Show the picture.
[122:36.13]I don't... I'm playing a game.
[122:40.09]Look at that eye.
[122:40.95]Those eyes are real, right?
[122:44.55]Link, link, link.
[122:45.61]I know!
[122:46.15]I see it!
[122:50.15]You guys can't fool me anymore, because now I just assume everything is fake.
[122:56.81]Here, I'll put it on screen.
[123:03.77]Look.
[123:05.95]Here.
[123:06.41]You want to see?
[123:06.86]Here you go.
[123:15.26]Here's what everybody is laughing about in here.
[123:29.31]There it is.
[123:33.01]Alright, those two images have the same energy though.
[123:49.22]Now what?
[123:51.24]No, I'm not putting that one on stream.
[123:52.96]I hate that picture.
[123:54.44]That picture scares the shit out of me.
[123:56.08]I hate that one.
[123:59.15]I'll keep this one here, but that one is... I hate that picture more than anything.
[124:06.23]That face you make when you get 50,000 subs.
[124:20.64]No, this is the face you make when the shower is too cold when you get in.
[124:26.77]What?
[124:26.99]It was running for like two minutes.
[124:28.55]What the fuck?
[124:37.04]There you go.
[124:40.26]No, I'm not putting... I'm not putting that image on screen.
[124:43.92]I'm sorry.
[124:44.64]I'm gonna give everybody nightmares because it's scaring me.
[124:47.28]I hate that picture.
[124:49.42]That is... I hate it.
[124:51.30]I hate everything about that picture.
[124:53.04]It's the worst picture in the world.
[124:57.87]No, I refuse to put that on stream.
[125:00.93]Nobody deserves to have to see that.
[125:06.25]How many tickets do I have?
[125:07.97]Free plays.
[125:11.45]I want to get the card on the right.
[125:27.60]Get in there.
[125:29.10]Ooh, did they come?
[125:34.72]No!
[125:34.80]Worst possible opportunity.
[125:44.39]Come on, big push.
[125:47.07]Oh, yeah.
[125:48.71]Why was I faking that reaction?
[125:58.76]No, I'm not clicking any more of these.
[126:01.26]I'm trying to win a hoverboard.
[126:19.36]Get that card in there!
[126:22.38]Show the fucking picture.
[126:27.19]Jesus Jesus Christ why is there so many in here do you see how many photos are in here right now no I'm not going to link the dunkin donuts gift card we've seen that it's funny
[126:53.52]Okay, I'm serious right now.
[126:55.00]This is one of those images that you're never going to unsee.
[126:59.56]You're going to look at this and you're not going to like this.
[127:05.09]Because I don't like it and it kind of hurts my head.
[127:08.41]So just warning, look away from the screen right now if you actually don't want to never have this image get out of your head for the rest of your life.
[127:34.98]Alright, I did it.
[127:35.70]Oh, it's on my other monitor!
[127:37.47]Get it off!
[127:46.09]You look like a bug.
[127:47.69]I... I got a bonus!
[128:03.44]I just want this card on the right and I can be done and I can go scratch lottery tickets.
[128:09.63]What do you mean wrong one?
[128:15.05]No, that's just an edited version.
[128:16.51]That one's not even as bad.
[128:20.35]That's like a typical scary image of like a scary monster.
[128:23.33]That's not... Show it then.
[128:35.00]Nah, I'm superstitious.
[128:36.14]I don't show pictures of demons.
[128:39.34]Get in there.
[128:39.86]Fuck.
[128:45.77]I haven't hit one.
[128:51.43]How am I this bad?
[129:04.20]Come on.
[129:04.56]Give me that purple card.
[129:05.48]That's all I want.
[129:06.42]Get it!
[129:06.70]Oh.
[129:08.04]Oh, spooky.
[129:08.40]That's spooky.
[129:08.82]Where's the 2,000?
[129:09.16]Did somebody steal my 2,000 tickets?
[129:14.28]What is this bullshit?
[129:33.52]Alright, I'm almost at the hoverboard.
[129:34.42]30% of the way to the hoverboard.
[129:39.83]Let's go.
[129:40.17]You ready?
[129:43.11]You know what machine I'm gonna use.
[129:44.13]30%.
[129:51.35]Wait, does anybody know if I have to get them all here?
[130:02.02]Or can I get them from another, uh, I almost said restaurant.
[130:07.28]You don't, okay.
[130:07.86]Well, I'm gonna do this, I'm gonna get like 10,000 more from this.
[130:10.70]Do this 10 times.
[130:11.74]What?
[130:18.75]I don't have any money.
[130:25.61]God damn it.
[130:26.15]Alright, we're gonna go to the other arcade.
[130:29.09]I'm gonna refresh my memory on the other games.
[130:39.12]It's time for lottery tickets?
[130:40.20]No, not yet.
[130:40.68]Not until I have my hoverboard.
[130:45.23]Do I have to take the bus again?
[130:46.49]Go play the bass game?
[130:51.13]Yeah, I could do that too.
[130:52.15]Wait, I want a Mountain Dew.
[130:54.41]Oh, sorry.
[130:56.83]Not added.
[130:59.16]Whatever it is.
[131:00.82]Danny DeVito or something.
[131:01.94]Oh, that's not either.
[131:02.80]Whatever.
[131:03.52]Whatever.
[131:09.22]When was the last time you guys drank a Mountain Dew?
[131:11.29]They're gross.
[131:33.72]For some reason, to be Mountain Dew, just regular Mountain Dew...
[131:39.45]It tastes like there's too much syrup in it.
[131:40.87]It's almost like you melted a bunch of lemon-lime popsicles and put it over ice.
[131:46.21]And added a little bit of water.
[131:47.29]It's just... I don't... There's something about it.
[131:49.07]Did they change the recipe?
[131:50.87]Why don't I drink diet?
[131:59.37]Because drinking diet anything is not really that great for you.
[132:13.11]The shit that they put in diet soda is really not good for you.
[132:17.03]They put, like, aspartame in that shit.
[132:18.53]You don't want to be drinking that.
[132:21.83]We've come up with a chemical that tastes sort of like sugar in a way.
[132:26.38]It also can, like, cause a bunch of diseases.
[132:34.82]This is not even my car.
[132:43.11]That's fake news?
[132:46.07]Fake news that aspartame... A recent published review of all available evidence, including hundreds of studies, concluded the studies provide no evidence to support an association between aspartame and... whatever.
[133:14.26]No, that's the fake news, is it?
[133:17.34]Did I just get fake newsed fake newsed?
[133:20.56]Did I just get fake news brackets fake newsed?
[133:24.64]Did I?
[133:25.68]No.
[133:27.02]Did that happen to me?
[133:27.64]I can't trust anything.
[133:29.59]What happened?
[133:39.93]Aspartame is one of the most controversial sweeteners in the world.
[133:42.33]It is claimed to cause health problems ranging from headaches to cancer.
[133:45.35]On the other hand, food safety authorities and other mainstream sources consider it to be safe.
[133:50.45]Who can you believe?
[133:55.19]The truth about aspartame.
[133:56.47]Is aspartame really dangerous?
[133:59.21]Is aspartame a carcinogen?
[134:02.55]What are the long-term effects of aspartame?
[134:04.23]Dizziness, depression, headaches, Alzheimer's.
[134:09.54]Does aspartame cause inflammation?
[134:11.02]There's too much info.
[134:12.92]Your body cannot process artificial ingredients well, so substances like aspartame and monosodium glutamate may trigger immune responses.
[134:19.36]There's too many angles, too many people, too many studies.
[134:23.59]There's too many... I have an anti-study.
[134:25.69]I have a study that's... But what about my study?
[134:29.25]What's going on?
[134:34.11]This is too deep.
[134:42.26]Fake.
[134:42.68]Fake news.
[134:43.32]News.
[134:45.52]MSG is safe.
[134:48.62]I know, but there's... I don't know.
[134:52.17]Here's the thing.
[134:53.21]I've heard the story about MSG.
[134:54.85]That one guy was mad at some restaurant and he made like a hit piece on it, right?
[135:00.26]Something like that.
[135:00.90]Right?
[135:11.82]Somebody was like, I got a headache.
[135:15.29]It has to be from the MSG, not the pack of cigarettes I smoke every day.
[135:19.63]Of course not.
[135:21.87]I don't know.
[135:22.37]It's too many things.
[135:23.19]There's too many things to know, too many things to read about.
[135:32.73]Long story short, eat a banana.
[135:37.54]Why is there a giant surge protector out here?
[135:52.32]It's for the robots.
[135:55.46]Uh, what does it say?
[135:59.99]Islandville Power Authority, authorized personnel only.
[136:04.77]Bananas actually cause you to die, unfortunately.
[136:07.83]Guys, I guarantee you there's a study for every single substance that's ever been invented of why you shouldn't be eating it or drinking it.
[136:16.51]Studies have shown that if you eat too many bananas, it's gonna cause you a potassium overdose.
[136:22.71]Okay.
[136:30.94]Is cheese the reason why you got a bad score on your SATs?
[136:34.48]Click here.
[136:34.92]I have enough for a ticket, right?
[136:55.05]I remember reading... So, everyone's seen that ad, and there was a... Somebody wrote an article about this one particular ad.
[137:04.19]You guys have probably seen it.
[137:05.86]It's the... Doctors found this one food that you should never eat.
[137:11.60]And the image is a bunch of tapeworms and worms in an intestinal tract.
[137:19.00]Right?
[137:23.72]And this person wrote an article about how they clicked on it, and they went searching for this doctor.
[137:27.44]It was actually a pretty interesting read.
[137:30.40]I forget what the article was.
[137:32.04]But go read it.
[137:32.64]It was pretty interesting.
[137:43.50]Is aspartame bat poop?
[137:48.73]I hate that ad.
[137:53.10]Advertisements just make no sense.
[137:55.04]We live in such a strange world where somebody can just buy ad space and just write just total dog shit.
[138:04.71]And it's whatever.
[138:07.39]Doctors found this one thing that makes you live over a hundred.
[138:10.71]It does?
[138:11.37]Yeah.
[138:12.65]Okay, what is it?
[138:14.71]Subscribe to this magazine that has nothing to do with anything that we ever told you.
[138:20.58]What?
[138:21.42]I want to know the fucking nutrient that makes me live forever.
[138:24.52]Oh, well, I don't even know what you're talking about.
[138:32.14]What the fuck?
[138:32.80]What is that even talking about?
[138:33.72]I can't believe you can just say anything.
[138:49.81]Ads work, unfortunately.
[138:52.66]Wait, I remember this one.
[138:53.48]Wait, let's get out here.
[138:54.26]Out, out, out, out, out.
[138:55.02]I want out.
[138:55.68]I want to get out.
[138:56.68]I want to go to the carnival again.
[138:58.76]Because there's other games here.
[138:59.68]What happened to the audio?
[139:20.36]That was fast.
[139:24.96]Where is the audio?
[139:31.82]Oh, there it is.
[139:34.71]Hi.
[139:36.51]I'm here for your games.
[139:38.11]By the way.
[139:38.55]Never mind.
[139:43.35]No, I don't want rides.
[139:45.75]No, no rides.
[139:46.41]Get them out.
[139:46.75]I don't want them.
[139:49.04]I've already read all these.
[139:49.84]I want to play the carnival games.
[139:52.95]There we go.
[139:53.67]A coin pusher.
[139:54.49]No, this is just for prizes.
[139:55.53]This isn't for tickets.
[139:56.99]I'm leaving.
[140:04.41]Was that here before?
[140:07.32]Was the ferris wheel here?
[140:15.74]Yes.
[140:16.20]Oh, okay.
[140:17.90]I have to wait 20 minutes for the next bus.
[140:19.54]No, I don't.
[140:20.20]It comes immediately.
[140:26.37]Ads.
[140:29.95]Ad companies are so fun.
[140:34.06]not not fun like funny I mean I didn't I didn't finish my sentence because this guy was driving erratically uh they first is a pre-roll ad and people have found a way ad companies found a way to make it because you know they know you're gonna skip so they just front load a ton of info in the first five seconds and they've paid for 30 second ads but they just front load everything in the first five seconds in the last 25 seconds don't even matter it's just they just added filled time
[141:09.70]Skippable ads are cheaper.
[141:11.02]That's true.
[141:18.78]Still have to pay.
[141:20.36]Still gonna pay for that 30 second slot.
[141:22.12]Might be a little bit cheaper.
[141:28.08]Is it gonna be JermaCraft today?
[141:31.12]Uh... No?
[141:38.70]Where's the boss?
[141:40.70]Oh, I have to call the bus.
[141:42.00]Whoops.
[141:45.37]We want ads.
[141:46.15]We already went over this.
[141:48.55]There's no reason for you to play ads on this stream.
[141:51.09]And there's no reason for anyone to give a shit about ads that's ever streams or ever does.
[141:56.44]Maybe on YouTube.
[141:57.48]I don't know.
[141:59.50]If I run an ad, 75% of you are not going to see it.
[142:02.60]Half of you have ad block.
[142:04.56]Half of you might be subbed.
[142:06.79]If I run an ad, like, 20... I'm just making, like, 400 of you's lives miserable.
[142:17.02]Coming pretty close to the edge there.
[142:24.32]Run it in-stream.
[142:26.68]See, that's the way to get around it, but that's... Why would I do that?
[142:37.57]That's the quickest way to delete a bunch of people that are currently watching.
[142:41.54]Alright, where are we going?
[142:46.88]Larry's Arcade, right?
[142:49.80]I need 100,000 tickets.
[142:56.99]Next, Barry's Pawn.
[142:58.13]Alright, I'm going to get off at Barry's Pawn.
[143:01.75]I have cows to sell.
[143:07.73]Actually just play Raid Shadow Legends on stream.
[143:12.37]No, I'm not going to do that.
[143:15.35]There are no pros to that.
[143:18.14]There's only cons.
[143:23.50]I can't think of more than one potential pro to that.
[143:31.94]That would be a funny stream for maybe five minutes, and then I'm playing Raid Shadow Legends on stream.
[143:45.47]Use other door You played numbers go Jesus Christ What is this What Hold on somebody just left a car who left a scratch ticket out here.

[147:55.56]You're robbing a house for arcade money.
[147:58.66]I don't even know where the hell I'm going.
[148:02.58]I... I guess we're gonna check out that house.
[148:05.86]I was supposed to go to the other arcade.
[148:13.39]Can I go in that house?

[162:36.92]You can't touch the middle.
[162:37.74]I remember.
[162:42.82]This one's fun.
[162:44.43]I remember I tried to win this, but it's almost impossible to win.
[162:59.40]Did I actually just try to rage quit the game?
[163:01.28]No.
[163:01.62]No, no, no.
[163:02.22]I need 70,000 more tickets.
[163:03.40]This is not efficient.
[163:04.46]Get out.
[163:11.92]Dunko?
[163:14.03]New Dunko.
[163:18.01]Wait, have I done this one?
[163:19.27]Is this one new?
[163:22.01]No, I remember this one.
[163:28.91]Yeah, I've done this one.
[163:44.90]Here's some Dunko Donuts.
[163:46.46]Because you're Reppin'.
[163:47.16]I'm sorry.
[163:57.01]What's the over-under on that?
[163:58.65]Is that like meme dead at this point and everybody hates it or people still think it's funny?
[164:02.78]I'm not sure yet.
[164:11.72]Oh, they got stuck.
[164:21.47]Thousand ticket and a free prize?
[164:23.27]What's the free prize?
[164:30.27]I don't remember there being a free prize.
[164:31.71]We'll have to check that out.
[164:40.28]I think it's the cards, right?
[164:45.88]Bonus.
[164:47.02]Aww.
[164:47.46]Alright, we've got to get these three.
[164:49.33]We've got to get three tickets.
[164:51.05]Bang, bang.
[164:51.87]What is it?
[164:54.91]I need all the cards.
[164:55.77]I gotta get them all.
[164:58.24]What does it say?
[164:58.74]What do I have?
[164:59.24]Okay, I need red and blue.
[165:02.30]Red and blue and then I'm done.
[165:07.20]Give me a red spawn.
[165:12.72]You get a dunko mascot suit?
[165:15.38]No, you get the plush.
[165:16.18]That's pretty cool.
[165:19.61]Oh, that's alright.
[165:21.86]It's going to put these down.
[165:22.64]I'm going to get the blue card.
[165:24.16]Give us Dizzy Bird.
[165:24.98]I will do Dizzy Bird in a minute.
[165:30.32]Get it for Gary.
[165:31.24]I will.
[165:32.64]We're going to do this another time.
[165:33.68]We're going to do... Okay, good.
[165:38.76]This should be enough to get the red card as well.
[165:40.68]I need a black card?
[165:42.68]Oh, shit.
[165:43.16]I need more than that.
[165:47.41]Anything but the bird game.
[165:49.25]But I already beat the bird game, so it doesn't matter.
[165:57.74]Go to the right.
[166:01.74]I know, I know, I know, I know.
[166:03.39]I was trying to get the blue card.
[166:19.55]Got it.
[166:27.00]He knows he can't do it again.
[166:28.20]Yeah.
[166:29.96]I know I can't do it again.
[166:32.74]That's okay.
[166:36.16]It's like what we talked about before.
[166:37.37]Like Jump King, right?
[166:41.27]Oh, do the Jump King DLC.
[166:42.83]It's really hard and it's crazy and you could like it.
[166:46.83]No, I'm not going to do that ever again.
[166:50.04]I've seen streams and streamers and clips of people on those DLC levels.
[166:58.68]And it's... I know what I'm capable of.
[167:01.84]It's not that.
[167:04.83]It's not that.
[167:10.01]You spoiled it.
[167:15.81]I got the... Look at this card!
[167:17.14]It's right here!
[167:17.92]How can I not get the one all the way to the left?
[167:20.24]I got the dunko card.
[167:28.38]It took xQc 60 hours to beat the game.
[167:32.06]Yeah.
[167:33.68]I can feel... I can feel that pain.
[167:38.94]I just can... That's a lot of time.
[167:44.15]That's a lot.
[167:50.24]Can I get another push, please?
[167:57.11]Alright, we get the black card and we need a red card.
[168:00.77]Jerma, can I have some tokens?
[168:01.85]No.
[168:03.03]Get your run.
[168:07.07]Just kidding.
[168:08.29]Here's 50.

[168:16.36]As long as you want.
[168:22.94]Okay, we need the red card.
[168:23.98]Spawn a red card so I can stop playing this, please.
[168:36.89]Spawn a truck?
[168:37.55]I don't think those are in this game.
[168:44.71]Give me another card.
[168:46.05]There's a red card over there, but it's not gonna count.
[168:54.88]Oh, I got it.
[168:56.82]Alright.
[168:57.90]Card.
[169:00.08]That's not bad.

[169:59.79]I'll take that.
[170:00.45]That's not horrible.
[170:02.39]That's better.
[170:03.95]That's much better.
[170:05.93]No?
[170:07.17]No!
[170:16.16]And this is ti- holy shit, this is x2, guys.

[171:53.60]What is this?
[171:54.10]That's Chris Pratt.
[172:17.23]He's trying to react to a meme.
[172:20.37]I don't know how you guys do this shit so quickly.
[172:29.97]Yeah, I saw the McChicken one, the best fast food sandwich.
[172:35.69]I don't even know what these images are.
[172:37.95]There's too many of these.
[172:40.35]Like, 20 minutes has gone by, and you got this, there's like seven new Photoshops in the chat.
[172:45.70]I can't keep up.
[172:56.36]The junior chicken is better.
[172:58.82]Oh, excuse me.
[172:59.81]No, it's not.
[173:02.09]The best fast food... I'm trying to move with my mouse.
[173:10.81]The McChicken from McDonald's.
[173:17.29]Just plain.
[173:18.31]Just the way it comes.
[173:19.49]Just McChicken, lettuce, a little bit of mayo.
[173:23.31]It's the best just when you're hungry.
[173:26.08]You can eat like six of them.
[173:30.48]And look, I'm not counting like, oh, what about Chick-fil-A?
[173:35.06]What about Popeye's?
[173:36.13]No, no, no, no, no, no.

[174:08.80]You don't want to eat McDonald's every day.
[174:10.48]You technically can.
[174:12.69]What I mean by that is, listen to what I mean.
[174:15.11]Chick-fil-A is sort of, it's a treat, in quotes, because it's not everywhere.
[174:21.39]There's a McDonald's every one mile.
[174:24.85]Some places across the country have maybe one Chick-fil-A in 50 miles.
[174:29.82]So, yes, what, are you going to drive to Chick-fil-A fucking 50 miles every day?
[174:36.88]That's what I meant by that statement.
[174:38.06]Good thing I have clarified that.
[174:39.24]I need a red card.
[174:56.28]A red card, please.
[175:03.90]Just eat McDonald's every day.
[175:10.58]Chicken's unimpressive.
[175:11.78]Yeah, but it's easy.

[175:28.54]No, I need to get to zero!
[175:31.72]Alright, okay.
[175:32.48]I gotta... I have to move on.
[175:34.34]I can't do this all day.
[175:35.30]I have to move on.
[175:35.88]Where are my tickets?
[175:39.34]Alright, here we go.
[175:39.94]Good, good, good, good, good, good, good.
[175:41.68]Yes.
[175:46.68]Fuck you.
[175:48.36]No, don't do five.
[175:51.51]Alright, we're in a good spot.
[175:54.61]Got it.
[175:54.97]Good.
[176:00.25]Give me a shitload.
[176:02.11]And give me a red card so I can get out of here.
[176:10.91]Red It's not red Yellow Give me a red card, that's a yellow card
[176:41.63]How many times am I going to get yellow and blue?
[176:47.45]Red.
[176:49.11]Oh my god.
[177:12.37]I just want the red.
[177:16.05]This is how they keep you here.
[177:19.31]Bonus.
[177:20.35]Oh, fuck.
[177:20.83]Yeah.

[177:21.95]Alright, we got 11.
[177:22.91]Don't want... There's no way there's a 7 this close.
[177:27.82]There it is.
[177:44.74]Do I know for a fact that the cards don't carry over?
[177:47.00]No?
[177:48.50]I mean... There's three different machines here that have three different numbers on them right now.
[177:52.89]I assume it has to be like that.
[178:04.19]Got it.
[178:04.96]Done.
[178:05.38]Done.
[178:05.68]Done.

[178:06.56]Red.
[178:06.84]Red.
[178:07.14]Red.
[178:07.44]Red.
[178:07.72]Red.

[178:10.94]We did it.
[178:13.12]Guys, we did it.
[178:17.85]You and I, we did it.
[178:22.15]And there's two.
[178:22.71]I can get two ducks.
[178:27.06]Make it three.
[178:28.84]Put a third one down here.
[178:33.80]Too good to be true.
[178:36.16]Too good to be true.
[178:38.55]Well, let's get it.
[178:52.92]We get Gary 2.
[178:53.88]That's actually not an untrue statement.
[178:59.16]Bonus.
[179:00.62]Alright, here comes the first duck.
[179:04.37]We're gonna get two or three ducks.
[179:06.05]Alright, come on.
[179:12.93]Got it.
[179:13.67]A thousand tickets and a free prize.
[179:15.37]Where is it?
[179:17.86]Wait, I already got one?
[179:23.07]This would be number three.
[179:30.87]Where do I get the free prize from?
[179:32.49]Is it... What happened to the cards?
[179:40.62]Oh!
[179:41.00]They reset.
[179:44.32]Okay, alright, alright, alright, alright.
[179:45.68]We don't even...
[179:47.60]Hold on.
[179:47.92]This is important.
[179:48.56]Here's how we... Wait one second.
[179:51.24]Because... Red.
[179:55.10]Green.
[179:56.70]Black.
[179:57.04]Okay, hold on.
[180:00.40]Just... I'm just going to see what happens.
[180:04.04]If a yellow card drops, then I'm going to... Wait, there's yellow and blue over here.
[180:16.72]Well, first let me go see and make sure I can even get this prize.
[180:19.98]I'm owed two.
[180:24.30]Technically, I'm owed two prizes.
[180:30.37]Yellow and blue is right there.
[180:31.33]Let's see if you guys are right.
[180:32.29]See if he carries over.
[180:37.05]Wait for the final push and then get my prize.
[180:42.01]He's a dunko addict, just like Grandma.
[180:56.10]Holy shit.
[180:58.78]That's a lot of tickets.
[181:00.44]Lot of tickets.
[181:01.22]Lot of tickets.
[181:01.86]Let's test it.
[181:02.78]No, they all reset.
[181:04.68]They reset.
[181:11.87]Where's my free prizes?
[181:53.74]Where are they?
[181:56.56]Oh, shit.
[182:01.46]Alright, I got- how many tickets do I got now?
[182:02.88]37,000.
[182:09.50]We're almost there.
[182:11.36]We're at 37%.
[182:11.66]Alright, I'm gonna do this one.
[182:15.06]I'm gonna try this one again.
[182:16.14]I like this one.
[182:16.56]This one's fun.
[182:16.94]As long as you pay attention.
[182:26.26]Alright, I'm trying to go too quick.
[182:34.53]Slow it down.
[182:43.03]The trick to this game is you let it bounce once, and then you do it on the second return.
[182:46.76]If you wait longer than that, you're not gonna get it.
[182:50.16]Because your brain can't keep up with it.
[182:51.86]You can only keep up with one turn.
[183:01.98]It speeds up at that last two.
[183:19.11]Dun, dun, dun.
[183:29.40]Is this a rerun?
[183:30.50]No, it's not a rerun.
[183:32.61]I just wanted to come back here.
[183:33.89]I'm just trying to get some... It's not a rerun.
[183:41.15]There's a new arcade that we went to.
[183:42.95]15 new games.
[183:43.39]I'm just checking out some of the old ones.
[183:44.63]Some of the new stuff that they put in.
[183:46.49]They put some new stuff in.
[183:48.31]I'm just checking it out.
[183:49.13]There's some stuff in here that's new.
[183:51.46]I'm just checking it out.
[183:53.24]And you play some old stuff when you're checking something out.
[184:22.62]He's re- I'm re-recording.
[184:41.69]Why did I think that was gonna be two?
[184:49.92]What the fuck am I doing?
[184:52.83]This is what... Look at that nerd neck.
[185:09.74]How do I get out of this?
[185:13.22]Oh, it's C. Hold on.
[185:24.32]What?
[185:31.79]Oh, I remember this one.
[185:32.41]This one's fun.
[185:35.33]Here we go.
[185:37.78]Ready?
[186:02.47]You are slow.
[186:03.51]I got it.
[186:14.30]Ah!
[186:15.94]Ow!
[186:22.78]Ow, what's happening?
[186:23.62]My graphics card's dying.
[186:24.94]My graphics card's dying.
[186:26.34]This frame might turn off.
[186:27.98]Are you guys seeing that?
[186:33.15]Are you guys seeing that?
[186:35.27]Green artifacts are all over my screen.
[186:42.42]No, you guys, it's not pulling it.
[186:43.98]Uh oh.
[186:54.05]Oh shit.
[186:57.23]It's only this game that's doing it.
[187:15.09]That's my fuck... Eh.
[187:16.22]Dead.
[187:16.56]It's my... The graphics card's fucking with me.
[187:21.97]Is it actually... Oh, it is my... Okay.
[187:28.66]Uh...
[188:05.64]He's in the matrix.
[188:10.45]I know what it is.
[188:11.03]I fix it.
[188:13.77]I fix it.
[188:14.27]I fix it.
[188:16.25]Quick, eat the red pill.
[188:19.47]No, but the blue one's probably blueberry.
[188:28.19]Hold on.
[188:28.51]I actually have to... My monitor just turned off.
[188:33.96]Oh, my cord was loose.
[188:34.96]It's okay.
[188:35.32]I fixed it.
[188:36.28]We're good to go.
[188:39.77]My monitor just fucking turned off.
[188:41.45]Come on.
[188:41.87]What are you doing?
[188:43.87]Stop.
[188:44.27]Why is my monitor doing this?
[188:45.55]Does my cable suck?
[188:55.50]I'll do it.
[188:55.94]Hold on.
[188:56.42]We're fine.
[188:58.32]Stop it.
[188:58.66]Stop it.
[188:58.92]Ha ha.
[188:59.24]Stop it.
[188:59.72]Stop it.
[189:00.00]Stop it.
[189:00.22]What are you talking about?
[189:05.83]I gotta pee.
[189:10.65]There we go.
[189:16.07]500 tickets again.
[189:34.08]Where are the balls going, Zerma?
[189:35.20]Where are the balls going?
[189:36.22]I don't know.
[189:38.03]What's more efficient?
[189:38.75]This or the spinny jackpot thing?
[189:42.15]What do you think?
[189:44.17]I gotta pee.
[189:44.85]Go to the bathroom now.
[189:45.58]No.
[190:07.10]Alright, let's go.
[190:08.06]Streamer shits himself on stream.
[190:11.52]I don't have to shit.
[190:12.78]I'm not gonna... I don't... I'm not gonna disappear for like 30 minutes.
[190:17.08]Who shits for 30 minutes?
[190:22.53]Um...
[190:39.22]I don't even start with this nonsense.
[190:46.06]It really depends.
[190:47.44]How much time do I have?
[190:48.22]Ah!
[191:04.61]Yeah, it depends on how much time I have.
[191:06.47]Do I have... How many hours do I have before I have to do something?
[191:19.47]It's in.
[191:20.03]I wish I could just put in like 10 credits worth.
[191:35.85]You know, this one's not even winnable unless the person who... You know, these machines have to take in a thousand dollars sometimes before they do anything.
[191:52.67]There'll be a PlayStation 4 up there or a Nintendo DS.
[191:57.49]How much is a Nintendo DS?
[192:00.33]Like what?
[192:00.71]200?
[192:00.73]How much is 3DS?
[192:01.07]Like 150?
[192:01.19]200 bucks?
[192:06.98]so let's say it's 200 for the Nintendo DS to be able to be won like it depends on who owns the machine but for the most part it's usually at least two or three times the amount of money has to come in so these prizes on the top row that's a Nintendo DS wow it's two dollar dollar to play this it's 600 bucks has to come in sometimes for this to happen and you also have to win
[192:36.06]You also have to win the actual game of skill once they allow you to be able to win.
[192:45.36]It's not RNG?
[192:46.90]No.
[192:48.56]Play my favorite game here.
[192:51.42]Insider Secrets.
[192:52.66]That's illegal?
[192:53.58]You know what's funny?
[192:54.98]Why is that legal?
[192:59.52]It's not actually a game of skill if you put it at... Is that supposed to be legal?
[193:05.25]Why is that legal?
[193:11.31]It's not technically gambling Not even close, not even close Not even close!
[193:35.34]I love this game.
[193:38.67]Hey, it's my first stream here.
[193:39.97]You're on top 10 underrated streamers.
[193:42.03]Oh, cool.
[193:43.07]Welcome.
[193:54.92]You missed some of that.
[193:56.48]What?
[194:03.82]Too much.
[194:06.13]Oh, I have to get green once.
[194:08.11]I love green.
[194:09.63]Did I get green?
[194:11.41]How did I get green?
[194:12.19]What?
[194:16.04]I wasn't even looking.
[194:25.30]Why would it give me a bonus?
[194:27.34]Jeremy, you've been playing the chicken game since July.
[194:30.46]Please stop.
[194:36.62]I did it.
[194:37.08]Yeah, he said it I've seen the video
[195:06.58]You know how hard it is to avoid some of these videos?
[195:10.28]Hey, click this link.
[195:11.76]What is this?
[195:12.40]It's called Ayaya.
[195:13.56]Okay, cool.
[195:14.36]I don't want to watch this right now.
[195:16.00]I'm busy.
[195:18.94]Imagine getting that message for six straight years.
[195:26.15]You have to apologize for that.
[195:27.35]Wait, what?
[195:34.02]I have to apologize?
[195:38.48]I have to apologize.
[195:50.24]We need a public apology.
[195:53.43]I'm sorry.
[195:54.77]I'm sorry.
[195:56.25]What do you want from me?
[196:00.79]Well, I can do an impression- I can do a shitty impression of Larry David, but I can't do like- I can't say that?
[196:15.60]I'm- I'm like- Apologize again.
[196:22.62]I'm not even fu- I don't even understand.
[196:27.19]I was like mocking the meme!
[196:30.67]And now I have to apologize for me mocking the meme!
[196:34.75]No!
[196:36.41]No!
[196:37.31]No apology.
[196:39.11]Nope.
[196:40.69]Uh-uh.
[196:42.03]Not gonna happen.
[196:43.35]No, I'm getting buried with this one.
[196:47.17]I'm getting buried.
[196:49.68]They're gonna be burying me in like another 75 years.
[196:56.14]And the elves impersonator that I've hired to do the talk at the end of your life thing.
[197:01.41]You're going to be like, oh, well, it seems that this boy...
[197:59.60]I'm not apologizing for it.
[198:00.71]I'm not apologizing for saying it
[198:03.28]I'm not apologizing.
[198:04.64]I'm not apologizing.
[198:05.12]I'm just saying... I... Oh, you said the meme thing.
[198:10.01]No.
[198:10.37]No apologies from here.
[198:13.19]I'm going to sleep with it.
[198:16.69]Apologize for what?
[198:17.77]I... If you weren't... If you weren't here like two minutes ago.
[198:22.58]Somebody said Ayaya in the chat and I did like a... Like a... Like a... It's the... It's the thing... It's the video.
[198:29.36]And people freaked out and now they demanded apology.
[198:57.34]Imagine if I uploaded a video to my main channel, and it opens up with me with, like, music playing, like, guys, I just want to say a couple things.
[199:06.13]Um, first of all, it's a hard video to make, I'm really sorry.
[199:09.25]Uh, I, I said, uh, ayaya.
[199:13.81]Uh, I did, like, a thing where I pretended to be the video for, like, like, at most six seconds.
[199:25.83]And everybody tried to burn my house down.
[199:34.10]And they've screamed at me and they called me a bunch of fucking names and idiot and stupid.
[199:39.00]And they, and they, they, they're screaming at me, but I'm the one that has to apologize now.
[199:42.70]So here you go.
[199:44.12]I guess I'm, I guess if you were bad, if you're mad about that, then sorry to hear that.
[199:58.01]It's an emote only.
[199:59.79]The passive-aggressive apology.
[200:02.16]The passive-aggressive non-apology.
[200:15.02]Apologize now.
[200:16.13]Apologize.
[200:18.47]Alright, I have to get the fuck out of this before I put on the video and sing to it at the same time.
[200:24.27]Just to punish you.
[200:36.90]Now everybody wants me to do that.
[200:38.32]Oh, do it.
[200:38.80]Do it.
[200:39.32]Do it.
[200:40.56]Oh, do that.
[200:41.12]Do it.
[200:41.40]No, do that.
[200:41.90]Do that.
[200:42.24]Do it.
[200:42.61]Do it.
[200:42.83]These are the people that just demanded an apology because I said the word out loud.
[200:51.31]Unbelievable.
[200:52.31]Pick a side, guys.
[200:58.42]It was an empty threat.
[200:59.62]I'm doing this one more time and I'm moving on.
[201:11.01]It glitched up there.
[201:12.31]Alright, goodbye.
[201:23.32]Look at these tickets.
[201:27.24]Do it or you're not going to get any gifted subs ever again.
[201:30.24]Enable the AI... Enable that emote for punishment.
[201:34.27]No, no, I'm not going to enable an emote to... What was I thinking saying that out loud?
[201:40.13]Of course.
[201:43.90]Saying the word... Saying the A-Y-A-Y-A-Y-A out loud to a large amount of people in this chat apparently is as if I turned on the webcam and was just naked.
[202:00.43]Going like, yeah, look at this!
[202:02.33]Wait, look at me!
[202:03.07]What?
[202:06.47]What?
[202:16.49]Compact empty threats.
[202:18.17]I got it.
[202:24.43]It's worse than that.
[202:25.43]It's not... Alright, that's it.
[202:28.01]That's it.
[202:28.35]I'm out.
[202:29.09]I can't... I've already beaten this once.
[202:30.45]I don't have to beat it again.
[202:31.75]This actually is a rerun stream if I stay here.
[202:35.29]Play the video.
[202:35.71]I'm not playing the video.
[202:36.77]No.
[202:37.07]Okay, just delete the last five minutes.
[202:43.40]Just pretend the last five minutes on stream didn't happen.
[202:47.78]You know what I mean?
[202:49.04]Like, we can just get over that.
[202:50.24]The last five... The last five minutes did not happen.
[203:02.98]You know what I'm saying?
[203:05.84]The last five minutes didn't happen.
[203:18.79]The most polarizing moment.
[203:20.27]Alright, 40,000 tickets.
[203:26.21]I almost just did it.
[203:27.25]I almost just went... I almost just went... I almost did it again.
[203:45.24]Oh my god, can you believe that Trevor lied about when...
[204:02.22]Give me those headphones.
[204:03.06]Give me those headphones.
[204:03.92]Give me those headphones.
[204:04.72]Alright.
[204:05.18]I'm good.
[204:05.82]I did it.
[204:08.32]Out.
[204:09.04]Out.
[204:09.78]Out.
[204:10.64]Out.
[204:14.69]Game's fucking easy.
[204:16.37]Alright.
[204:16.59]Let's go to Bass.
[204:20.23]Pull it.
[204:20.99]And we're going back to the other casino.
[204:24.01]Do it.
[204:24.45]Oh.
[204:35.46]Ooh, you got yourself 10 tickets.
[204:40.20]What is Cuckoo Clock?
[204:41.08]I've never seen Cuckoo Clock.
[204:41.94]Let's do Cuckoo Clock.
[204:52.30]This shit is impossible.
[204:53.32]I don't know why people even play this.
[204:58.96]There's no reason to play this.
[205:08.48]Yeah, I said this last time.
[205:09.66]Get me out of this.
[205:10.28]What a dumb game.
[205:12.22]And for some reason, also... Every arcade now... There's got to be some weird deal with this company.
[205:20.14]Whoever manufactures this shit.
[205:22.36]Because it's one of the only games that most arcades with this ten of them in a row.
[205:27.62]Ten of them!
[205:29.40]And there's always people playing them.
[205:32.44]Every machine is loaded with people waiting in line.
[205:36.49]Are they paid actors?
[205:47.52]And it's like six bucks to play this.
[205:53.54]So they're just playing for free and then you go, oh, I think I want to do that.
[205:57.07]And they go, oh, I guess you're going to have a turn.
[205:58.35]I almost won a thousand.
[205:59.97]And you spend 30 bucks here and then you leave and they made $30.
[206:02.07]Alright, let's go.
[206:07.00]Cash out.
[206:20.70]What?
[206:55.35]40,234 tickets.
[206:56.53]Let's go back to the other arcade and have some fun.
[206:59.17]But first, let's listen to the fun song.
[207:00.59]Remember the funny song?
[207:03.73]Here we go.
[207:05.59]It's time for the funny song.
[207:09.89]Where's the funny song?
[207:16.53]Oh, never mind.
[207:21.16]Ah, I can't.
[207:21.98]No.
[207:22.36]Alright, let's go.
[207:24.40]Limo driver, please take me to the other casino, please.
[207:30.06]Uh-huh.
[207:30.86]Let's go to the UFO.
[207:46.51]Just scream at us already.
[207:47.87]Jesus, I've been waiting for hours.
[207:49.07]What?
[207:50.63]Scream at us?
[207:53.05]Why am I screaming at you?
[207:55.55]I didn't even play this one.
[207:57.13]Are you serious?
[207:58.25]I didn't even play the... I didn't play Clock Tower.
[208:01.77]What does this one do?
[208:04.74]Ball drops.
[208:08.88]Oh, it's this thing.
[208:09.96]You have to... Damn it.
[208:19.04]Alright.
[208:25.49]500.
[208:25.57]Ugh.
[208:25.71]I hate this thing, too.
[208:30.63]Why is it always the worst ones that take up the most amount of space?
[208:33.03]This is a small apartment.
[208:36.47]You could live in the spot that this thing takes up in the casino.
[208:40.81]In the arcade.
[208:43.11]Why does it have to take this much time?
[208:44.55]I mean, this much space?
[208:52.31]I gotta at least win the 500.
[208:58.17]I wasn't even ready.
[208:59.15]That's not fair.
[209:02.51]That's not fair.
[209:33.54]Why is everybody doing question marks?
[209:35.34]What?
[209:48.13]Could have had 500?
[209:48.53]I mean, it's hard to control.
[209:52.01]This one's a waste.
[209:53.80]I could get so much more tickets playing the spaceship machine thing.
[209:55.90]Alright, hold on.
[210:02.13]Two balls.
[210:03.17]There we go.
[210:07.62]I have infinite money, though.
[210:09.00]No, I don't.
[210:09.66]I'm empty.
[210:14.68]That should be a thousand.
[210:18.42]Oh.
[210:20.47]What?
[210:32.60]I need money.
[210:34.17]I gotta pee.
[210:34.55]I forgot to pee.
[210:36.16]Let's pee first.
[210:36.76]I'll be right back.
[214:05.94]One of these days, it might be funny if I'm like, oh, I'm gonna go take a break.
[214:10.84]You know, it's been like three, four hours on stream.
[214:14.02]I go take a break.
[214:15.16]Ah, I'm just gonna go pee.
[214:17.45]And then I come back and it's a new video feed and it's just me, IRL, like going through the McDonald's drive-thru.
[214:29.81]And then I come back and we just go back to what we were doing.
[214:37.27]Maybe you'll see that someday.
[214:38.17]Alright, back to it.
[214:45.10]40,000 tickets.
[214:45.56]I need 100.
[214:47.46]We know how to get that.
[214:49.96]We know how to get that.
[214:55.07]Oh, no money.
[214:57.37]Could solve that real quick.
[215:02.31]No, wait.
[215:02.67]That's not money.
[215:03.31]That's tickets.
[215:03.77]Where is it?
[215:04.85]Where is it?
[215:06.70]It's like over here.
[215:11.26]Don't even eat the food?
[215:15.18]Why would I not eat the food?
[215:16.54]He's becoming delirious.
[215:31.69]Now, check this out.
[215:32.33]We're going to get the other 60,000 tickets real soon.
[215:39.71]Friendship ended with Jerma, now Drew Crew is my best friend.
[215:42.37]I'm part of that crew.
[215:54.92]Yes, this is just a money printing machine.
[215:56.56]From what I understand, when this game actually releases, when it truly launches, and it's actually in 1.0, there's going to be another game mode called Survival.
[216:08.22]Where you cannot just print money.
[216:10.70]You need to do jobs and stuff.
[216:12.14]I think they really wanted to be an interesting, weird survival game.
[216:17.56]From what I understand.
[216:18.36]Alright, let's do it.
[216:24.43]Here we go.
[216:31.01]Kids gambling survival.
[216:32.67]Hey, well... You gotta hand it to them.
[216:36.53]No one's ever done that before.
[216:40.80]No one's ever made a kids gambling game.
[216:43.80]Actually, I have.
[216:44.53]Oh, yes, they have.
[216:45.51]Like, every game that's come out in the last five years has been like a gambling game specifically to make kids gamble.
[216:52.83]What am I talking about?
[216:55.89]It's all of them.
[216:59.92]Like you.
[217:17.51]But they're not survival gambling games.
[217:19.75]Oh, shit, you're right.
[217:20.71]This one is how you get the tickets.
[217:23.66]I'll be there in less than 20 minutes.
[217:25.46]Alright, start counting now.
[217:27.80]I know people are going to be like, dude, you're going to be here for 10 straight minutes?
[217:31.14]Yes, at least.
[217:32.26]Let me see.
[217:32.66]3 hours and 37 minutes?
[217:33.96]At 3 hours and 47 minutes, we'll see where we are.
[217:59.62]This machine's gonna get nerfed.
[218:01.52]It probably is.
[218:02.18]It probably is.
[218:05.70]This is how you can get tickets quick here.
[218:10.92]It's 500 every... Potentially, if you can really time this correctly, it's 500 tickets every three seconds.
[218:19.99]Ooh!
[218:31.89]These machines are easy in real life.
[218:33.23]These machines are rigged in real life.
[218:37.78]Evacuate the building.
[218:42.28]Evacuate.
[218:46.73]Evacuate.
[218:47.51]I've won too many times.
[218:48.93]This machine is smoking and setting off the fire alarm.
[219:10.12]Sparkler Kid?
[219:11.66]I love Sparkler Kid Sparkler Kid's awesome Yeah, even a robot can't win these, yeah Because it'll make it move one light forward or one light backward regardless if you hit it or not They've tested this with programs Is...
[219:31.87]No, this is not balanced.
[219:32.98]I spent three hours grinding Dizzy Bird for payout.
[219:35.34]That wasn't half of this.
[219:36.44]Sorry, you gotta have to go.
[219:42.19]You gotta get with the meta.
[220:02.09]At what point do you think somebody that worked at this arcade would come over here?
[220:06.78]And be like, what's going on over there?
[220:08.26]Or do you think they would just not even give a shit and who cares and just like go back to what they were doing?
[220:20.94]Oh no, I'm becoming more ticket than man.
[220:34.61]Are you getting paid to stop them?
[220:36.81]Are you getting paid to work here?
[220:39.31]And part of... I'm out of money.
[220:48.44]Holy shit.
[220:59.66]Alright, this is a lot.
[221:05.52]Let's see.
[221:07.04]That wasn't even ten minutes.
[221:11.24]That was what?
[221:12.42]Four minutes?
[221:16.25]That's 8,000 tickets in four minutes.
[221:19.93]Yep.
[221:22.13]I'm gonna do the money machine like five times in a row.
[221:37.31]Move on from this lame-ass place.
[221:38.87]It's time for the Dru to solve the case.
[221:40.83]I appreciate the effort on that.
[221:58.51]Go-kart's a riot.
[221:59.57]I will.
[222:01.83]I'm gonna bring my hoverboard onto the go-kart track.
[222:05.20]They won't be able to catch me They'll try Let's do it
[222:31.15]If you hold down a while while playing, it'll automatically start another one, so you can get them faster.
[222:35.42]If you hold down?
[222:38.54]What?
[222:44.34]Hold down A. Oh my god!
[223:01.21]Oh!
[223:04.26]Oh!
[223:06.94]The cops are outside!
[223:16.96]Oh my Jesus!
[223:27.54]This game is a disgrace.
[223:28.84]Play Drew with your face.
[223:32.33]What?
[223:32.65]Did I just read that right?

[224:48.71]I want to do this in real life.
[224:54.71]Am I allowed to stream in an arcade?
[225:11.41]Probably not, unless I get permission.
[225:19.93]How many was that?
[225:22.78]And we're not even at 10 minutes.
[225:24.34]What'd I tell you?
[225:25.08]What was that?
[225:25.46]8,000 first one, 6,500 for the next one?
[225:30.68]That's 14, almost 15,000 tickets in 10 minutes.
[225:35.30]Easy.
[225:36.38]I'm going to do this twice in a row so I don't have to leave the machine.
[225:45.02]Yes, you can.
[225:45.70]Oh, that's cool.
[225:48.06]Alright.
[225:48.98]Can you actually do that?
[226:08.17]What's Icelandic for degenerate gambler?
[226:14.27]I don't know.
[226:19.17]I don't know what it is.
[226:24.33]What is it?
[226:25.51]Get back in there.
[226:27.61]This game doesn't take our fancy.
[226:28.99]It's time to party with Nancy.
[226:37.03]Play it three more times.
[226:39.49]I'll stop at $200.
[226:45.87]Guys, I've got like 10 years of streaming to play Nancy Drew.
[226:50.54]And that's how long it's going to take.
[227:03.10]He thinks he has 10 years.
[227:04.52]I got plenty of time.
[227:09.60]Alright, one more time, and then I'm gonna just sit there for at least 10 to 15 straight minutes.
[227:24.95]He's addicted.
[227:26.77]Yeah, I'm addicted to getting cool shit.
[227:29.05]I wanna get the hoverboard.
[227:33.12]Once I get the hoverboard, then everything's fine.
[227:39.28]A raid just came in.
[227:40.50]A huge raid.
[227:42.06]From BoxBox.
[227:44.40]BoxBox.
[227:46.74]Hello again!
[227:50.35]Welcome everybody.
[227:53.33]Thanks a lot, BoxBox.
[227:55.15]I'm playing arcade games right now.
[227:57.77]BoxBox, I gotta raid you.
[227:59.05]When do you stream?
[228:09.46]Every day?
[228:11.16]Right now?
[228:14.40]Well, you can't be streaming right now.
[228:18.86]But hey, welcome everybody.
[228:21.81]Thanks a lot, BoxBox.
[228:22.73]Seriously, that's a lot of people.
[228:25.61]Unfortunately, you came to a stream where the person is just doing this.
[228:31.63]I'm addicted.
[228:32.51]I'm already addicted, so I can't say much besides this.
[228:39.50]There it is.
[228:41.00]That's for box, box.
[228:42.46]And his raid.
[228:45.66]What's that?
[228:46.54]You want two jackpots?
[228:48.76]You want two jackpots?
[228:50.37]Oh, yeah.
[228:50.81]You'll take two jackpots.
[228:52.29]Sure thing.
[228:53.37]How about three jackpots?
[228:59.55]You want three?
[229:00.97]I'll get it.
[229:01.52]I'll get it.
[229:01.90]I'll get it.
[229:02.36]I'll get it.
[229:03.46]You're in follower-only mode.
[229:04.62]Oh, shit.
[229:05.00]Turn it off.
[229:07.64]Turn off follow only for like 10 minutes.
[229:11.30]That's two jackpots in a row.
[229:13.92]Here comes three in a row for you guys.
[229:16.44]There it is.
[229:16.70]Alright, holding it down is like crashing the game.
[229:27.73]It's too late?
[229:30.09]No, just turn off follow.
[229:30.87]You can turn it off.
[229:31.65]Turn off follow only for like 30 minutes.
[229:34.77]That's too long.
[229:38.23]I gotta know!
[229:40.41]He's playing Elf Bowling later.
[229:41.95]Stick around, raiders.
[229:47.05]Imagine falling asleep.
[229:50.81]What?
[229:51.75]They left for another Dru-Crew streamer.
[229:54.92]Is my money going up?
[229:55.72]How do I have...
[230:07.39]Come on, I'm washed up.
[230:09.25]I can't just suck like this.
[230:10.87]I have to do... We just had a huge raid come in.
[230:13.14]Come on.
[230:15.40]Oh, no.
[230:15.92]Oh, no.
[230:16.16]Oh, no.
[230:16.34]This is not good.
[230:37.70]I actually did lose it.
[230:40.66]No, I'm washed up.
[230:43.13]Oh, I'm really washed up.
[230:44.67]I might as well quit.
[230:45.83]Never quit!
[230:47.42]Don't ever quit!
[231:02.96]Ski ball, ski ball, ski ball.
[231:04.37]I'll do some ski ball.
[231:05.87]After I spend $200 on this.
[231:07.09]That's three in a row.
[231:13.33]What's the most I've ever had?
[231:23.68]Five in a row?
[231:36.72]Wish me a Merry Christmas.
[231:37.98]Hey, have a Merry Christmas.
[231:39.27]Hope you have a good one.
[231:42.21]Hope you get everything you want.
[231:43.29]Hope Santa doesn't get stuck in your chimney and suffocate.
[231:47.35]Because he can't get out.
[231:49.57]And he can't reach his cell phone.
[231:51.41]Because how would you be able to reach your cell phone if you got stuck in a chimney?
[231:53.91]You can't reach down in your pockets.
[231:54.99]You would just suffocate in the chimney.
[231:57.79]Really hope that doesn't happen to Santa at your house.
[232:01.82]Because then Santa's lawyers might come and find you.
[232:05.18]And they might be like, well, your chimney was not at regulation chimney.
[232:07.87]It was about 15% too small.
[232:10.17]And you'd be like, I don't know.
[232:11.15]And then you'd be sued and you'd lose everything.
[232:31.38]I can't... I'm gonna... I'm speaking of suffocating... I can't... Help me!
[232:44.56]I can't reach my cell phone!
[232:46.77]I can't reach my cell phone!
[232:56.25]No...
[233:00.58]No.
[233:06.47]Yeah.
[233:14.07]I can't... I'm fucking my view!
[233:17.73]Alright.
[233:19.01]I can just do it by feeling.
[233:24.38]I'll just do it by the... I can close my eyes and do it.
[233:36.61]Don't make me put it on and get sued.
[233:39.79]I'm putting it on.
[233:40.60]Who cares?
[234:12.17]Come on.
[234:12.55]I can do it.
[234:14.53]I can't do it!
[234:56.05]Come on!
[234:59.20]Come on, just think of... Just think of Uncle Ben!
[235:04.40]Wait, no, that's Spider-Man!
[235:34.52]Gemma confirmed force sensitive.
[235:38.34]You think so?
[235:42.71]Really?
[235:50.78]Do you think I am?
[235:51.92]Let me try.
[235:52.98]Let's see.
[236:11.61]What the fuck, dude?
[236:16.95]What the fuck is going on?
[236:33.38]I think I should go to the academy.
[236:44.03]Worst joke ever.
[236:45.87]Everybody hates that.
[236:47.62]Why?
[236:48.52]Why?
[236:49.30]What?
[236:50.44]Spoilers, but you can have force powers.
[236:55.43]Oh, the game crashed.
[237:09.14]Why was that the worst joke ever?
[237:11.38]Was it?
[237:11.78]I have to apologize.
[237:16.06]Sorry again, guys, for a forced... It's the Star Wars bed.
[237:30.44]I actually can't see.
[237:31.58]I can play?
[237:36.50]Why can I play like this?
[237:52.80]What?
[238:01.33]I turned into a caterpillar!
[238:07.16]Oh my god, my chest hurts.
[238:13.70]I have to win one.
[238:33.34]No!
[238:35.22]It fell off.
[238:37.86]Okay.
[238:38.08]Do I have no money?
[238:48.07]Oh.
[238:49.51]It actually moved me.
[239:01.97]Hey, ACDCFreak, thanks for the five community cells.
[239:06.15]Hold F. Oh, no, those are out of reach.
[239:44.50]Every last drop.

[239:52.72]14,000 tickets, holy shit.
[240:01.42]70% of the way there, boys and girls.
[240:16.52]Alright, now I'll ride the go-karts.
[240:21.52]No, no, no, no.
[240:22.44]The box-box wanted me to do skee-ball.
[240:24.01]I'll do that.
[240:27.53]It's been like... It's been like 30 minutes.
[240:31.73]Box-box, are you still here?
[240:33.59]This one's for you.

[241:20.16]Riven players don't deserve... what?
[241:22.26]I don't know what that is.
[241:24.34]What's a Riven player?
[241:40.17]Missed Riven is a good game.

[242:18.63]have accidentally, in ski ball or in throw the ball at the thing, knock its head down, how many times have you thrown it a little too hard and it's come all the way back and hit you in the chest or something?
[242:29.94]Apparently, I'm a psycho.
[242:35.70]How many times have you ever done something like this?
[242:37.00]Like, ready?
[242:37.40]Like... Oh, shit.
[242:39.36]I fucked it up and it's coming back.

[243:53.54]Let's make it clean I have to get in first place Weren't these people on the track before I got here though?
[244:15.72]That's not fair
[244:24.12]They had a head start.
[244:31.63]How am I in position six?
[244:37.57]Get out of the way.

[245:05.30]Where are the other... I don't understand this.
[245:28.37]You know what I'm saying?
[245:30.07]There's no drivers to be in a position above me.

[250:13.47]Can I... Wait a minute.
[250:15.71]Hold on.
[250:15.95]Preset the whole thing.
[250:18.27]I can cheat.
[250:21.39]If I go that way and then come... I can drive over this and just... Okay.
[250:24.64]Let's try it.
[250:34.06]It's not position.
[250:34.68]It's just lap time.
[250:35.44]Yeah.
[250:35.70]So who cares?
[250:36.20]Let's go.
[250:37.69]What if I... Wait, hold on.
[250:38.39]What if I do this?
[250:47.92]How smart is the game?
[250:51.76]Smart.
[250:58.73]I can't tech that one.
[251:03.35]Um...
[251:08.14]Yeah, I'm stuck.
[251:08.76]Alright, I'm not going to win that one.

[252:19.95]I would, I would agree with you.
[252:22.61]Oh shit, here we go again.
[252:24.70]The viewer is plummeting.
[252:29.30]Don't worry, I'll get them back.
[252:31.54]Watch.
[252:33.74]They'll come back.
[252:35.14]They're on the way out.
[252:36.24]They're like, I'm thinking about clicking the X and then this guy just did fucking three jackpot.
[252:40.38]We can leave.

[254:28.20]Yeah, it's the spirit of feeling good, spirit of giving.
[254:35.91]You know what I mean?
[254:36.35]It's the spirit of giving and receiving.

[258:47.26]Mute!
[259:13.29]There we go.
[259:19.00]Now I can't do it without the siren.
[259:27.26]I can't do it without the siren.
[259:29.94]There's no sense of urgency.
[259:30.94]There we go.

[260:20.50]What am I trying to get with the tickets?
[260:21.38]I'm trying to get a hoverboard.
[260:32.83]Damn it.
[260:35.01]Can you tell me a joke?
[260:36.21]If you do more channel points, maybe you can.
[260:47.88]Let's see if you guys can figure out what my favorite song is.
[260:50.68]What's my favorite song on the entire Chrono Trigger OST?
[260:52.82]What is it?
[260:54.02]Anybody know?
[261:05.29]Frog is alright.
[261:06.95]Frog is okay.
[261:07.71]It's not Frog.
[261:14.40]Joke or riot.
[261:15.50]No, they were going to say a joke.
[261:16.96]They were going to tell a joke.
[261:19.68]Not me.
[261:24.65]We're waiting for them to tell the joke.
[261:26.63]They said, do you want to hear a joke?
[261:28.51]It was in Channel Points.
[261:35.31]Please play Chrono Trigger.
[261:36.47]It's one of the best games ever made, so why wouldn't I?
[261:43.98]It's the Epoch theme.
[261:45.72]Epoch.
[261:46.18]Epoch.
[261:46.56]Whatever it is.
[261:48.48]Don't crash.
[261:53.46]That's the best one.
[261:55.84]Nah, pick these up.
[261:56.72]It's gonna crash.
[261:57.14]When are you gonna do a Chrono Trigger stream?
[262:05.93]I'll probably treat that the same way I did Mario RPG.
[262:08.47]Which is... A day that I feel like being nostalgic.
[262:12.55]I'll beat it.
[262:15.12]It's another game that I've probably beaten at least five to ten times at least.
[262:18.42]Uh-oh, it's starting to really hang.
[262:32.71]Any good RPG recommendations, chat?
[262:34.47]I just beat Divinity 2.
[262:35.27]Chrono Trigger?
[262:40.45]Yeah, I haven't saved the game once all night.
[262:42.31]Holy shit, this is bad.
[262:45.29]Excuse me.
[262:51.45]Knock knock.
[262:51.81]Who's there?
[262:52.15]Who?
[262:52.27]Who?
[262:52.49]Who?
[262:52.79]Who let the owl in?
[262:54.09]That was pretty good.
[262:54.61]83,000.
[263:03.74]I gotta save again.
[263:11.10]Acknowledge me.
[263:11.64]I grinded for these points.
[263:12.74]Hey, what's up?
[263:23.46]alright everyone can breathe play the epog theme it'll show up
[263:54.96]You are manually breathing now.
[263:56.28]That doesn't work.
[263:56.84]It only works in Jump King.
[263:59.12]When I'm aware of every single thing I'm doing.
[264:06.05]Do they add new things to the game?
[264:07.23]Yes.
[264:07.45]This area that I'm in right now is a brand new area.
[264:11.39]As of a week or two ago.
[264:13.92]15 new games.
[264:15.44]100,000 tickets for a hoverboard.
[264:16.86]And you get a house now.
[264:18.32]And a duck.
[264:18.68]Pretty cool.
[264:22.44]I don't like this one.
[264:22.98]This one's sad.
[264:31.45]Where is it?
[264:32.27]Where's the Epoch?
[264:34.97]Battle theme, pretty good.
[264:36.04]Where's the Epoch?
[264:42.32]Come on, where's the Epoch?
[264:49.37]The Epoch's the best!
[264:53.31]Oh, that one's good too.
[264:57.45]The hell is it It's got it's called like the wings of time or something, right?
[265:13.69]Wings across time there it is.
[265:16.49]Let's go
[265:45.01]This is the best song.
[265:46.05]Is this like Actraiser?
[265:47.61]Is it?
[265:47.97]Dev in chat?
[265:48.67]Really?
[265:48.87]No, why do I believe that?
[265:50.20]Dev ain't here.
[266:23.35]Hey, it's me.
[266:26.29]The thing is, though, it's like the boy who cried wolf.
[266:28.20]Because remember when I played Dusk?
[266:30.18]And everyone was like, dude, dev, dev and chat.
[266:32.00]And I'm like, okay, yeah, whatever.
[266:33.54]Yeah, that was real.
[266:39.19]And then started tweeting.
[266:40.35]Remember, like, they started tweeting that I was bad at the game and stuff?
[266:59.59]Okay.
[267:00.94]I'm sorry.
[267:01.48]I'm going to have to defend myself here.
[267:03.26]If you play a game like Dusk on the arguably the actual hardest difficulty in the game and you beat it, what do you want me to do?
[267:13.44]Close my eyes and do it?
[267:15.86]Back to the music.
[267:31.62]We're close.
[267:35.78]He's throwing chairs at us.
[267:41.48]Eat a ghost pepper.
[267:42.50]Yeah.
[267:48.00]Oh, by the way, I also figured out after the fact that the boots was just a joke.
[267:52.50]You guys, they don't do anything.
[267:54.24]So, yeah.
[267:56.38]Glad we had a fight over that for like an hour and a half straight.
[268:09.78]Shit.
[268:10.08]Okay, come on.
[268:10.54]I have to... This has got to be the one.
[268:12.74]Okay, I promise I won't play this one again.
[268:15.10]I promise.
[268:16.56]I promise I won't play this one again.
[268:17.83]I promise.
[268:21.81]We will finish the rest with games that you guys want me to play.
[268:25.15]Uh-oh, it's starting to take over.
[268:42.99]Promise me you'll get the boots.
[268:44.89]Maybe on another playthrough.
[268:46.53]Years from now.
[268:47.90]That's three in a row.
[268:48.52]Alright, I'm gonna- I'm definitely close.
[269:05.23]I gotta get- I have two more chances.
[269:08.11]Alright, that's good.
[269:08.83]I'm happy now.
[269:09.43]Last chance, get it.
[269:10.97]Sorry.
[269:11.37]Alright.
[269:12.31]I'm not playing this one ever again.
[269:14.57]Drew Crew.
[269:36.57]Alright.
[269:38.01]It's time.
[269:40.05]We can get rid of the OST.
[269:42.01]That was just to pass a little bit of time.
[269:43.31]Well, I got 10, you know, 15,000 points.
[269:45.97]I don't think these sliders do anything.
[269:54.67]Dizzy bird.
[269:55.07]Well, I can end it on dizzy bird.
[269:59.10]Do the coin pusher.
[269:59.78]We'll do coin pusher.
[270:02.24]Alright, I'm at 92,000.
[270:03.64]I need just about 7,500 more.
[270:07.62]Good.
[270:10.26]I want to try this one again.
[270:11.78]But I need money.
[270:14.34]I want to try that one again.
[270:15.18]I thought that was a music playing.
[270:18.80]I thought I auto-played a video.
[270:30.89]The dev is actually here.
[270:34.56]Devotid is actual dev.
[270:36.76]Devotid.
[270:39.20]What's up?
[270:41.86]We really like your game.
[270:44.67]It's great.
[270:46.97]It's awesome.
[270:50.45]I rarely get to watch anymore LOL.
[270:59.42]Keep adding cool stuff.
[271:05.30]I know you've already got three arcades.
[271:11.22]It's too addicting and too much fun.
[271:14.08]You know what I mean?
[271:16.48]What was the coin pusher game that I didn't do?
[271:22.23]It's good as it is.
[271:23.21]It's great as it is.
[271:27.33]But I'm a sicko and I need one more.
[271:32.18]More.
[271:33.60]He's demanding more.
[271:34.80]More, more, more.
[271:35.62]Alright, I'll do laser tag.
[271:42.24]Because people didn't get to see it.
[271:48.99]We'll go spawn camp.
[271:57.47]We need more, Arthur.
[272:00.83]Just gonna do one more of these, Arthur.
[272:03.65]Just one more.
[272:05.39]I swear this'll be it.
[272:07.34]Don't you say that game sucked?
[272:33.00]Wait.
[272:34.60]I'm sorry.
[272:35.26]It's hard to follow what we as gamers don't and do not like.
[272:40.63]Do we not like Red Dead Redemption 2?
[272:42.79]I didn't get the memo on this one.
[272:45.57]We do?
[272:48.35]It was okay.
[272:49.53]It sucked.
[272:49.77]I gotta get on the right...
[272:59.76]Alright, it's time to spawn camp.
[273:01.04]Oh, I got three shots?
[273:01.82]No, give me another one.
[273:15.18]Am I crazy or did the dev just subscribe?
[273:18.04]Uh, that's a good question.
[273:18.68]Maybe.
[273:19.04]Alright, let me get in here.
[273:22.38]Let's spawn camp the same person.
[273:23.84]How'd you guys- Why are you up there?
[273:34.41]Stop body blocking.
[273:44.60]Oh, dick.
[273:45.52]Whatever.
[273:49.84]Can I recharge here?
[273:55.29]Come with me.
[273:56.39]For a second.
[274:08.30]Okay, I have an idea.
[274:11.08]I'm going to bring him over to the recharge station and just get points.
[274:14.63]Not a thousand tickets.
[274:15.67]That's a lot.
[274:22.52]Dev is Drew Crew.
[274:25.24]Pretty good, actually.
[274:27.06]There we go.
[274:38.82]Alright, stay here.
[274:40.08]Damn it!
[274:40.62]He's running away.
[275:20.72]No roughhousing, yeah.
[275:22.10]He's got moon aim.
[275:36.57]I don't know what that means.
[275:38.69]What's that even supposed to mean?
[275:40.29]Like I'm on low gravity or something?
[275:41.56]I don't get it.
[275:49.29]Move, move!
[275:50.93]Move!
[275:51.31]Simon?
[276:15.22]Moon aim sucks, Mars aim is great.
[276:17.46]Oh, right, this is stronger.
[276:19.86]Gravitational pull, I get you.
[276:21.30]Thousand points?
[276:23.72]Thirteen fifty, nice.
[276:27.17]Sixteen key D.
[276:47.85]Alright, what am I finishing up with?
[276:51.17]Coin push, you're right.
[276:51.87]Somebody wanted to do coin push.
[276:52.81]That sounds fun.
[276:53.53]We'll do that.
[276:54.57]We'll do the SpongeBob one.
[276:58.23]Or... Bird.
[277:03.87]Duck.
[277:06.27]Chicken.
[277:09.49]Um... Dunko.
[277:11.42]The mermaid one.
[277:13.52]Yeah, mermaid one's good.
[277:14.44]Let's do mermaid one.
[277:15.24]This one's actually... Yeah, this one's fun.
[277:17.02]This one's brand new, by the way.
[277:18.20]I think this one actually came out, like, last week.
[277:25.58]Here we go.
[277:26.42]This thing's primed and ready.
[277:29.25]Okay.
[277:39.16]How many more do I need?
[277:43.35]Like 90?
[277:43.65]Oh my god.
[277:49.90]Spam.
[277:51.48]Yeah, let's spam.
[277:55.34]Mm-hmm.
[277:59.05]Mm-hmm.
[277:59.99]Mm-hmm.
[278:00.77]Mm-hmm.
[278:02.49]Mm-hmm.
[278:03.59]This is really loud, though.
[278:06.53]Why is this so much louder than it was before?
[278:12.90]Alright, stop Burgah Boy Tempeh.
[278:18.37]That's not helping.
[278:22.13]We need some nuance here.
[278:22.93]There we go.
[278:23.81]Watch this.
[278:37.00]Hey, welcome to Twitch.
[278:45.13]Enjoy your first, like, three hours.
[278:46.81]Holy shit, that's loud.
[278:54.83]Alright, I gotta turn it down.
[278:57.72]It is way too loud.
[278:59.16]But didn't I already- I did turn it down.
[279:02.60]Uh-oh, is it broken?
[279:05.24]800 tickets?
[279:05.98]Let's go right up the middle
[279:32.17]Ooh, I get a bonus.
[279:34.11]The deck is a sub?
[279:36.95]Well, thank you.
[279:39.99]Welcome.
[279:42.87]Your game is very charming and fun.
[279:46.53]It's a nice change of pace.
[279:49.24]You know, it's just... You just can play arcade games.
[279:53.00]Just hang on.
[279:53.98]Give me another bonus.
[280:06.10]Oh... 1273.
[280:08.24]Let's see how close we are.
[280:15.84]I thought... I didn't leave tickets on the ground.
[280:17.50]Where?
[280:17.70]3,009.
[280:17.72]I need 4,000 tickets.
[280:31.86]Dizzy Bird, please.
[280:33.46]I will finish with Dizzy Bird, I promise.
[280:35.04]Let's do this one.
[280:37.68]The audio's bugged?
[280:38.78]Eh, it's all good.
[280:40.28]Ho ho!
[280:44.74]Ho ho!
[280:47.84]Ho ho!

[280:55.70]Ho ho!
[280:58.12]Ho ho!
[280:59.22]Ho ho!
[281:03.39]360.
[281:05.85]That's pretty good tickets.
[281:08.36]Let's do it again.
[281:09.48]Two more times.
[281:10.26]That's it.
[281:10.64]If I get to 400, then I win.
[281:33.30]I feel like I was very accurate that time.
[281:41.52]Not going for doubles?
[281:42.50]It's hard.
[282:04.26]That's the one!
[282:05.90]Yes!
[282:06.06]400!
[282:06.08]Oh, I'm very excited about this apparently.
[282:15.57]Okay.
[282:17.13]It's almost time.
[282:21.13]It's almost time.
[282:42.69]Those of you that know, you know.
[282:43.79]If you know, you know.
[282:46.55]That just went through.
[282:50.38]The credit went through, and it instantly was a jackpot.
[282:54.40]Those of you that know, you know.
[282:56.70]It's hard for me to explain that, but you know.
[282:58.37]Alright, let's go back to the Mermaid.
[283:12.95]This should get us there.
[283:13.67]Let's go right in the middle.
[283:17.89]Spread it out, too.
[283:20.63]Hold on.
[283:21.63]Can you play the story mode?
[283:24.81]Holy shit, that was a lot.
[283:29.10]No, not...
[283:40.71]The story mode is... No, it's not active.
[283:45.23]I want to try it when that comes up.
[284:01.14]This might be the biggest, uh, win from, uh, this machine up.
[284:05.44]On strength, and on tech.
[284:06.43]That was a big one.
[284:09.81]Oh, they all went flat, too.
[284:13.01]You'd love to see that.
[284:23.37]easy easy spread it out there it is flat alright I'm gonna post a juice in 10 seconds somebody prepare the bottom juice somebody do it
[284:53.50]Come on.
[284:58.34]Oh, no.
[285:20.33]Come on.
[285:21.35]I didn't get a bonus.
[285:22.82]Come on.
[285:25.24]Right here.
[285:25.64]179 tickets for a bonus.
[285:28.94]What are you talking about?
[285:33.94]More credits.
[285:37.75]Sorry.
[285:41.51]That's it.
[285:41.81]1200 tickets.
[285:44.47]We'll do, uh, one more time and I'm just gonna spam in the same corner.
[285:50.76]Or, yeah.
[285:51.12]50.
[285:51.62]60.
[285:51.64]It's not gonna move at all.
[285:58.55]Did you ride above the hurricane?
[286:01.63]No, I didn't.
[286:02.51]This is gonna be meaty if it falls.
[286:22.22]That was cool.
[286:38.34]That's not a lot of tickets though.
[286:41.39]I'm not satisfied with that one.
[286:43.83]Because look at the left side now.
[286:45.83]Alright, we'll do one more.
[286:46.57]One more real one.
[286:48.29]And I'm going to Dizzy... Dizzy Bird.
[286:59.71]Disney Bird?
[287:01.94]No.
[287:02.28]Dizzy Bird.
[287:03.08]Dizzy Bird.
[287:03.72]Look at that left side.
[287:07.64]That comes over here.
[287:08.24]It's pretty insane.
[287:08.94]Look how ridiculous that is.
[287:13.08]I need to get it.
[287:21.87]Look at this shit.
[287:22.83]There we go.
[287:24.43]Crush it.
[287:49.76]This last one counts.
[287:51.14]Because it really does.
[287:51.92]Because look at all these 10s and 20s and 100s.
[287:58.20]And then we'll cash in and go Dizzy Break.
[288:01.68]Flat.
[288:02.98]Flat.
[288:17.25]That's the one that I wanted.
[288:18.77]That's the one right there.
[288:19.77]My cat is addicted to watching me play.
[288:23.55]It's kind of odd.
[288:27.93]I wonder why.
[288:45.23]Well, I'm addicted to playing this, so... I'm not a cat or anything, but it's fun.
[288:54.83]Dizzy Bird's the best arcade game in real life.
[288:58.19]I'm not sure I agree with that.
[289:02.72]Alright, when am I getting concluded after this stream is over?
[289:08.52]First thing I will do, I promise.
[289:19.14]Alright.
[289:19.62]More.
[289:19.80]More.
[289:19.98]20.
[289:20.08]Alright.
[289:21.66]Let's make this tactical.
[289:23.67]Look at that left side.
[289:25.71]Tactical.
[289:50.52]So, where are these tickets on the ground everyone says it exists Where are they?
[290:00.35]Oh

[296:28.96]It is now.
[296:31.01]there happy merry Christmas are there any new machines in here
[297:02.70]I remember this part.
[297:12.70]I got the ticket back, whatever.
[297:15.38]No, I'm not going to sit here for an hour or two like I did last time, I promise.
[297:18.72]I just want to see what it was all about.
[297:21.84]I just want to see what it was all about.
[297:34.99]One more fish.
[297:36.32]Come on, fish.
[298:10.06]Spoiled brat.
[298:11.70]Alright, I'm going to end it with Dizzy Bird.
[298:15.56]And then I'm going to play Elf Bowling for like 10 minutes.
[298:20.25]Let's go.
[298:20.69]Dizzy Bird time.
[298:32.60]Get the fireworks.
[298:36.20]Yeah, I did the fireworks last time.
[298:43.81]No, you can't do this twice.
[298:44.99]I know it's my birthday.
[298:46.03]Happy birthday!
[298:50.33]Really?
[298:50.67]I knew the surprise was coming.
[298:52.31]Unbelievable.
[298:52.87]I can't believe you guys.
[298:54.46]Why wouldn't you surprise me?
[299:21.44]I'm gonna just do this until I have no more money.
[299:25.38]What is it, two bucks?
[299:25.96]Alright, no, I'm gonna do it ten times.
[299:31.54]That was one.
[299:34.46]That was not even close.
[299:41.24]How'd I get a penny?
[299:43.60]Yeah, where did a penny come from?
[299:45.67]That seems out of place.
[299:55.16]That's too far.
[299:55.76]That's too hard to gauge.
[300:01.47]That's too far to gauge.
[300:03.85]You need the one that's close.
[300:04.81]And it's in the same spot, but... At least I get a bonus.
[300:21.40]Right there.
[300:21.76]Right there!
[300:29.31]How many was that?
[300:29.81]Four?
[300:30.03]This is the best one to do.
[300:33.39]I wasn't even close.
[300:53.66]Not even close.
[300:56.54]Not even close.
[300:58.02]It's okay.
[300:58.74]I've already beaten it.
[301:02.53]Alright.
[301:03.41]Three more.
[301:03.81]This is memory.
[301:04.68]I'm serious.
[301:05.68]I'm only doing this ten times.
[301:10.28]How the fuck do I keep messing up?
[301:14.97]It's alright.
[301:16.89]Two more.
[301:34.51]Last one incoming.
[301:35.40]Where's the light?
[301:50.75]Are you fucking kidding me?
[301:51.75]I almost got it.
[301:58.46]There it is, the final one.
[302:09.54]I'm leaving without you.
[302:12.10]I'm leaving without you.
[302:14.02]What is going on with you?
[302:20.52]Alright, that's it.
[302:21.68]That's Dizzy Bird.
[302:22.24]That's the end.
[302:22.80]Now we're going to move on.
[302:23.52]We're going to drink a Mountain Dew.
[302:27.90]And that is it for the game.
[302:31.34]Until the next update, whenever that happens.
[302:34.87]Now we're going to do Elf Bowling.
[302:39.77]Where's the trash?
[302:44.78]There is no trash.
[302:53.40]That was good.
[302:54.60]That's a pretty substantial update.
[302:57.44]You got a whole new arcade.
[302:58.54]You got a house with a duck in it and everything.
[303:03.83]That's pretty cool.
[303:07.58]Yeah, I'm gonna transition to elf bowling.
[303:27.47]I have to end the stream the same way I ended the last one.
[303:32.45]Hey!
[303:45.77]I was just toting somebody was Bowser I'll take one I'll take two
[304:12.33]Alright, we got two of these.
[304:14.38]Where are they?
[304:15.20]Here.
[304:20.38]Okay, we'll pick it up.
[304:27.45]Everyone watch out.
[304:46.70]Put it in the golf cart and drive around?
[304:48.34]I don't think it'll stay.
[304:52.93]I'll try.
[304:58.69]Damn it.
[304:59.09]I kind of want to do like 20 of these in the golf cart.
[305:03.03]Can I do that?
[305:09.39]No way.
[305:10.15]One will barely fit in here.
[305:13.41]Is it facing the right way?
[305:25.17]Drive!
[305:26.21]Drive!
[305:40.80]I drove the car into the water last time, too.
[305:42.56]Yeah, that's what I have to do.
[305:44.40]Does it fail?
[305:45.18]Well, I can't drive over this for some reason.
[305:53.71]Come on!
[305:55.58]Why can I not drive over this?
[305:56.62]Is it patched?
[306:26.54]Yeah, we're good.
[306:46.88]I'm still going.
[306:58.25]Still going, still going, still going.
[307:03.19]Still going!
[307:04.63]Go!
[307:06.95]Keep going!
[307:09.05]Keep going!
[307:10.61]Go!
[307:12.09]More!
[307:14.16]More!
[307:24.68]I'm not pressing any buttons.
[307:30.79]There it is.
[307:31.13]The end of the world.
[307:34.10]Oh, I didn't save the game.
[308:10.55]Uh... Remind me that if I play this game again, I don't have any more gas.
[308:15.62]And I need to walk back to... Can you die?
[308:18.06]No, I can teleport.
[308:19.40]I can teleport.
[308:19.88]Alright, outballing time.
[308:22.94]To end this stream.
[308:23.50]Merry Christmas, everybody.
[308:24.96]If you're taking off, we'll see, uh, when I get back.
[308:27.84]I'm gonna be taking a few days off for the holiday.
[308:31.64]Please continue to nominate and discuss the end of the year stuff that's not turning off.
[308:37.62]I will see you guys on Friday, the 27th.
[308:43.53]If you celebrate Christmas, happy Christmas, happy holidays.
[308:50.25]Whatever you happen to be celebrating, happy holidays to you.
[308:53.55]I'll be back on Friday.
[308:56.85]And now let's do elf bowling.
[309:05.67]And if you were curious, yes, it's already here, ready to go.
[309:12.29]It is.
[309:27.39]I didn't know they were naked.
[309:53.83]How do you play?
[309:56.57]Oh, like that.
[309:57.21]X. This is the first game I ever played.
[310:01.78]Is it really?
[310:09.69]I feel like it's at x10 speed.
[310:13.77]Why does it sound so fast?
[310:18.87]Strike.
[310:26.00]Let me get two in a row.
[310:28.10]There it is.
[310:34.10]It's my processor is going too fast.
[310:37.56]Did it just cut off somebody's head?
[310:39.18]I don't remember doing that.
[310:46.09]It just ripped his head off.
[310:53.69]God, that was three strikes in a row.
[310:57.89]Elf bowling dev in chat?
[311:00.53]Uh, no way.
[311:01.99]Because I don't think... This game came out like 30 years ago.
[311:11.04]Sorry, something came on the screen.
[311:12.16]I had to try to throw something at it.
[311:13.22]I don't know why.
[311:21.29]How old is this game?
[311:24.31]Um, I don't know.
[311:25.09]When did the internet come out?
[311:27.54]1997?
[311:27.82]1996?
[311:31.10]I think I could probably get at least four or five strikes in a row if I try hard.
[311:34.26]I gotta use my right hand.
[311:48.57]That's a spare.
[311:52.28]You thought the game broke when the elf's head came off?
[311:56.87]This game was completely showered in controversy.
[312:00.43]If you don't know.
[312:02.13]Correct me if I'm wrong, but I believe the original version of this game was a virus.
[312:08.57]Right?
[312:11.02]It was, wasn't it?
[312:12.14]The original version of this game was a virus.
[312:23.68]Hold on.
[312:26.22]I need to confirm.
[312:27.62]Somebody look it up.
[312:33.60]It's definitely sped up.
[312:34.60]Let's do, uh, quit.
[312:41.44]Elf bowling.
[312:41.88]Let's do elf bowling 2.
[312:49.31]Elves in Paradise.
[312:55.06]Alright, this doesn't like, okay, I need to be clear, this doesn't like show his elf dick, right?
[312:59.67]Tell me that's not true.
[313:01.59]Oh, it should, I don't want to get an elf dick.
[313:03.99]Okay, there's probably an elf dick in this.
[313:12.85]It's shuffleboard.
[313:22.28]Don't.
[313:22.84]Don't pull your fucking underwear down.
[313:24.81]Alright, I'm outta here.
[313:34.09]Don't pull your fucking elf underwear down.
[313:35.95]Don't you fucking dare.
[313:43.47]Don't.
[313:48.89]I gotta go right up this way.
[313:55.64]It wasn't a virus, by the way.
[313:56.90]It wasn't?
[314:04.65]There's an elf deck.
[314:05.31]Play something else.
[314:08.37]There's probably... I don't think there is.
[314:16.98]300!
[314:18.70]They made a movie based on this?
[314:30.49]If you have received Elf Bowling or Frogapult games on the internet, spam that again, I can't, I didn't see it.
[314:42.64]It's awful?
[314:45.66]If you've received Elf Bowling or Frogapult games that have been circling the internet, and no one has, they must be deleted before Christmas Day.
[314:51.16]They contain viruses that is to go off on Christmas Day and will delete your hard drive.
[314:55.38]That wasn't real?
[315:01.09]It was a hoax.
[315:08.99]I don't know.
[315:11.09]How am I supposed to know?
[315:13.27]I was probably like 12 years old.
[315:19.03]It still is.
[315:19.59]You have less than 24 hours to delete this.
[315:22.82]I don't want to play this anymore.
[315:25.46]I'm done.
[315:34.60]How is this Elf Bowling 2?
[315:40.15]Elf movie, Elf Bowling movie IMDB link.
[315:44.13]Is there a trailer for the movie?
[315:45.37]I can watch that, right?
[315:46.11]That's not like against the rules.
[315:47.59]I wanna watch the trailer.
[315:50.95]Yeah, let's watch the trailer for Elf Bowling the movie.
[316:03.73]Ooh, you're dead.
[316:06.35]This is the last round.
[316:07.27]Alright, I'm done.
[316:23.12]Forget about Polar Bowler?
[316:24.50]Alright, that was fun.
[316:31.12]You thought I was going to do that for less than 10 minutes?
[316:35.28]More than 10 minutes?
[316:36.08]No way.
[316:36.86]Not a million years.
[316:39.46]I want to watch the Elf Bowling movie trailer.
[316:46.67]Elf Bowling the movie.
[316:52.86]Alright, let's watch it.
[317:03.94]Please rate your ad experience.
[317:05.40]Oh, shut up.
[317:07.44]Yeah, called... I hate it.
[317:08.86]Alright, Elf Bowling Trailer.
[317:12.21]Ten years ago?
[317:17.01]This trailer is in, like, a terrible... 480p trailer.
[317:21.71]This is... Okay.
[317:25.03]Let's go.
[317:30.72]Yeah.
[317:31.98]Okay, ready?
[317:32.52]Okay.
[317:44.99]Put all them crates of stolen toys in me cabin.
[317:48.32]First of all, I'm just going to say an episode of Mickey Mouse Clubhouse has just about the same amount of animation quality.
[317:59.12]Could it be that a long, long time ago, Santa started out as a pirate and wound up kicked off his own ship?
[318:07.48]It's him.
[318:08.54]And what do you lads do in this wondrous place?
[318:12.26]See for yourself.
[318:14.75]It's a magical and mystical, marvelous world.
[318:19.49]It's destiny.
[318:20.57]It doesn't even fit him.
[318:21.83]It doesn't even fit him.
[318:23.93]Reindeer and toys.
[318:26.94]Yes, boss.
[318:27.84]A cunning, dastardly.
[318:29.58]You're going to call me the Madagascar penguins?
[318:32.24]Evil force is threatening to put an end to Christmas.
[318:36.90]Are we sure this is not an iPad ad for an iPad game?
[318:40.02]Elf Bowling, the movie.
[318:41.10]This is like a chick flick, except instead of smoking babes, dude, it's a bunch getting a fat guy.
[319:05.37]Is this movie in public domain?
[319:06.77]Can we watch this movie on stream?
[319:08.43]I would.
[319:14.99]Wait, what?
[319:15.43]There's a second movie?
[319:17.19]No, there's not.
[319:27.73]No, no, that's not real.
[319:34.95]Is it in public domain?
[319:37.97]No way.
[319:44.44]Who owns the rights to elf bowling the movie?
[319:51.14]The Wikipedia article for it has been marked for deletion.
[319:59.98]That's the nail in the coffin right there.
[320:03.05]Oh, that's so funny.
[320:04.27]Well, we have to watch it before it gets deleted from the world.
[320:09.69]If it's not on Wikipedia, then it doesn't exist.
[320:14.61]Buy the rights to the Elf Bowling movie.
[320:16.38]It's probably way more expensive than you think.
[320:20.04]I would not be surprised if the rights to Elf Bowling and Elf Bowling the movie, all Elf Bowling intellectual property...
[320:28.49]is less than two to three hundred thousand dollars it's probably like five hundred thousand dollars imagine doing a Kickstarter for like a million dollars and the goal of Kickstarter is for me to get enough money to buy out and own the IP of elf bowling but what would I do
[321:01.88]It was six and a half million dollars to make that movie.
[321:04.18]There's no way I could afford to buy Elf Bowling's IP.
[321:08.56]To watch it on stream.
[321:10.04]To watch the movie on stream.
[321:15.09]Buy it to put it in the public domain.
[321:27.42]God.
[321:30.08]Anyways.
[321:32.30]That's gonna wrap up the stream.
[321:34.10]I'm gonna get some food.
[321:35.88]That was a lot of fun.
[321:41.33]Hopefully you guys have a good Christmas.
[321:47.75]I'll see you guys on Friday.
[321:49.73]For... I don't know.
[321:53.71]I don't know.
[321:58.79]What the hell?
[321:59.55]What the hell?
[322:00.90]Nancy Drew?
[322:07.91]no no no no no no no no no yes no may we'll see we'll see if it depends on how good my Christmas was if I had a really great Christmas then maybe we'll do Nancy Drew post Christmas stream
[322:30.50]If I didn't like Mike, if I didn't have fun on Christmas, then we'll do The Surge 2.
[322:38.06]I gotta stop saying I'm gonna play The Surge 2.
[322:40.20]Because... I don't want to do that.
[322:49.51]Anywho.
[322:51.41]Let's do the bits and the subs and everything.
[322:53.43]What about Disco Elysium?
[322:54.99]That's another thing I was thinking of.
[322:58.85]We'll see.
[323:00.52]We'll see.
[323:03.74]See you guys on Friday.
[323:05.62]Have a great holiday.
[323:08.36]If you haven't yet, I want to make sure I keep reiterating this.
[323:11.72]Go to the Discord and check out the nominations channel for the New Year's Eve stream.
[323:16.55]Nominate something.
[323:17.41]If you see one of those categories, go to the discussion channel.
[323:19.85]There's a pinned message.
[323:21.33]Discuss it.
[323:22.13]Nominate.
[323:23.05]Nominate stuff if you want.
[323:26.05]It is currently available.
[323:27.09]It is going to stop...
[323:29.50]the day that I come back Friday the 27th as of probably I don't know Friday night as of the stream turning off on Friday that's it for nominations and then the voting is going to start the next day literally the next day for three days you will have three full days to cast your vote and then obviously on the 31st we have to go over them
[324:02.09]I'll be talking about it every single stream leading up to the 31st.
[324:06.09]The day I come back is the last day that you can nominate something.
[324:11.58]Check it out.
[324:17.16]Let's do the bits.
[324:22.13]Be good.
[324:22.63]Yeah, I hope Santa is good to you guys this year.
[324:29.47]Let's go back to earlier this afternoon.
[324:34.25]We had Dark Soul.
[324:35.07]Dark Soul, thanks for the $2.50.
[324:35.87]I'm here from Gap Gaming with your first paycheck.
[324:40.88]We're really looking forward to sponsoring more streams, but keep in mind these bits confirm your agreement to our exclusivity deal.
[324:46.80]You can only wear Gap brand clothes on stream and you must now refer to your viewers as Gappers.
[324:51.80]Thanks and have a great stream.
[324:53.34]Imagine doing that for $2.50.
[324:56.88]Uh, add, add four zeros, and maybe I'll think about it.
[325:00.30]25, 250, 2500, 25,000, 250, alright, that's 2.5 million dollars.
[325:07.98]I thought it was a little bit less than that.
[325:09.40]Alright, never mind.
[325:11.60]Hey, DarkSoul, thanks for the 250.
[325:12.82]Hi, I'm here from Gap Gaming.
[325:14.56]Wait, what?
[325:15.70]Why is it happening twice?
[325:20.71]It's not, it's the same one, but I don't know why it's, it doesn't make any sense.
[325:24.83]Hey, it's me from Gap Gaming, and hey, a triple, triple zero NEO thanks to the 250.
[325:30.53]Chicken Game or Riot?
[325:31.67]I did.
[325:32.73]Played it a few times, actually.
[325:37.37]What about Community Night?
[325:39.07]Yeah, Community Night got screwed up because I was supposed to go in front of the green screen before the third one happened.
[325:46.12]And I ended up having to push the green screen until further notice, until I started to go to the physical therapy and...
[325:52.72]It got a little botched, so that's still going to have to sit on the burner for another couple weeks, probably.
[325:58.96]But I'm no longer going to wait.
[326:01.97]I'm not going to wait anymore to do Community Content Night 3.
[326:07.31]So, it'll probably happen at some point in the middle of January.
[326:12.61]First or second week of January.
[326:17.22]That's that.
[326:18.60]But thank you, TripleZero.
[326:20.50]We did play the checking game.
[326:22.32]Martin had a meme, thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[326:24.81]$20 from Martin had a meme.
[326:27.23]Thanks for the 2,000 bits.
[326:29.67]This was the game where you had your scratch ticket stream idea, and I'd like to one-up that by saying you should buy a bunch of scratch and sniff cards and smell them on stream.
[326:38.73]Well, the scratch card thing got fucked up because I didn't know that Nevada doesn't have a state lottery.
[326:45.20]So I'm like, we're gonna scratch $200 worth of scratch tickets.
[326:50.59]For every death in Sekiro!
[326:52.17]And it's like, oh, sorry, turns out there are no scratch tickets in Nevada.
[326:55.51]They don't exist.
[326:56.21]There's no such thing.
[326:57.40]There's no state lottery in Nevada.
[326:59.90]And I was like, alright, well maybe I'll have somebody send me buy $300 worth of scratch tickets and send them to me?
[327:07.02]From, like, Massachusetts?
[327:08.87]Nobody wants to fucking do that.
[327:12.29]Hey, can you buy $300 worth of scratch tickets and mail them to me and I'll pay you?
[327:15.91]It's like, leave me alone, Jeremy.
[327:20.60]Go to California.
[327:21.36]Fly to California.
[327:27.18]That's a lie stream.
[327:29.02]No, that's not fair.
[327:30.20]That's not a lie.
[327:31.06]I couldn't do it.
[327:34.56]I don't know that Nevada... I've only been here for a year.
[327:36.72]I didn't know that I couldn't do that.
[327:40.97]It's not a lie.
[327:42.03]If you attempt to do something and you legally... Whatever.
[327:46.07]Whatever.
[327:48.43]Okay, sure.
[327:50.38]Sorry I didn't get on an airplane to go to California to buy scratch tickets.
[328:00.24]Isn't California right across the border?
[328:02.51]Um, yeah, it's like a four-hour drive.
[328:07.57]That's an eight-plus-hour trip to go get scratch tickets.
[328:17.73]That's not long.
[328:19.37]That's a long ass time in a car!
[328:26.27]And that's not just 8 hours.
[328:28.59]That's 4 hours plus to get there.
[328:31.48]That's without traffic in California.
[328:35.12]Once I get into California,
[328:38.11]Am I just gonna drive to the border, take a step over the border and find the first gas station and buy $300 worth of scratch tickets in the first gas?
[328:47.40]They're gonna call the police on me.
[328:54.29]Wouldn't they turn around and drive back over the border?
[328:57.07]That's... Is it weird that I'm scared to do that?
[329:04.45]Imagine if I got pulled over, like, going over the border to Nevada.
[329:08.66]Sir, I see that you just pulled into a gas station.
[329:11.20]Yeah, I did.
[329:12.34]Can I take a look inside your car here?
[329:14.80]Uh, yeah.
[329:15.44]What are these scratch tickets doing here?
[329:16.74]I know, I know.
[329:17.32]It's not illegal.
[329:18.28]I know.
[329:19.74]It's not like... It's not illegal to scratch scratch tickets in another state.
[329:29.42]I'm just... It's not illegal.
[329:32.97]Look, I'm gonna- let's- let's be- No, I did- I did not drive three, four, five hours across the border to get scratch tickets.
[329:42.62]I'm sorry, I didn't do that.
[329:50.45]Alright, how about this?
[329:51.21]The next time- Oh, it's gonna be a lie.
[329:54.01]The next time I'm in California, this is a lie.
[329:56.07]Why do I even say this?
[329:57.15]The next time I'm in California, which I go a few times a year, stuff like E3, TwitchCon, you know, the next time I'm in California, I'm gonna buy 300 fucking dollars worth of scratch tickets, but then I'm gonna get searched at TSA.
[330:11.80]They're gonna be like, what's this guy doing?
[330:13.98]Why is this guy so addicted to gambling that he goes on a trip to Los Angeles?
[330:21.88]and buys like 50 scratch tickets and it's in his bag he's going where's what's his what's it where's his ticket to Las Vegas this dude's going back to Las Vegas with like 75 scratch tickets I'm gonna get searched I'm gonna be like okay what are you doing here
[330:50.31]Guys, you know if you walk off the airplane in the Las Vegas airport, there's a slot machine right when you get out of the terminal.
[330:55.75]They're gonna be like, what are you doing?
[330:58.35]Mail them to yourself.
[330:59.17]Mail... Mail...
[331:13.47]Yes, I'd like to send a package, please.
[331:15.31]Oh, okay.
[331:16.57]Welcome to, like, the UPS store.
[331:19.11]Welcome to the USPS office.
[331:20.47]Welcome to FedEx store.
[331:21.87]How can I help you?
[331:23.37]Yeah, I'd like to mail a hundred scratch tickets to myself.
[331:26.90]Oh, you're insane.
[331:28.82]Sure thing.
[331:29.32]It's your money.
[331:39.36]Where do you live?
[331:40.80]Las Vegas.
[331:42.19]Okay.
[331:52.62]Just buy the stamp.
[331:53.52]You don't have to tell them what you're sending.
[331:54.90]Yeah, but I'm fucking crazy.
[331:57.32]I know it's in that box.
[331:58.48]And I'm going to be like, ha, this is a scratch.
[332:00.00]It's in there.
[332:01.76]I don't know.
[332:02.89]I'm a weirdo.
[332:05.53]Oh, yeah, here, I'm just sending out a package.
[332:08.11]Okay, yeah, thank you.
[332:09.51]That's it.
[332:09.95]That's all our conversation has to be.
[332:11.45]Yes, scratch tickets in there.
[332:12.85]What the heck?
[332:14.13]What am I doing?
[332:16.39]Okay.
[332:16.99]Yes, have a good day.
[332:33.31]You're an Oblivion NPC?
[332:44.81]I just have to say everything I'm doing.
[332:48.39]Walk in there.
[332:49.98]Oh, cool door.
[332:51.40]Interesting door.
[332:53.08]Howdy.
[332:53.60]How are you?
[332:54.76]Hi.
[332:55.10]Wow.
[332:57.24]Scratch tickets in this box.
[332:59.98]How much?
[333:01.20]Howdy.
[333:02.42]How are you?
[333:10.58]You're a math problem.
[333:19.35]That's not an Oblivion NPC, that's a shitty, that's a bad Let's Player.
[333:29.92]Yeah, that's pretty, that's pretty good.
[333:31.90]That's pretty good.
[333:32.68]Anyways!
[333:34.42]Uh... Scratch and sniff cards, but you can't smell them.
[333:38.00]How, how could, why would that work?
[334:00.75]I can't.
[334:08.15]Alright.
[334:09.57]Alright.
[334:10.71]I'm gonna... Let's go.
[334:14.29]Let's go.
[334:15.36]Let's go.
[334:16.06]Let's go.
[334:16.84]We got... We got... Let's go.
[334:20.18]Let's go.
[334:20.78]Let's go.
[334:21.18]It's four hours to Los Angeles, alright?
[334:24.36]It's like a five hour drive, alright?
[334:33.72]How dare you prove me wrong and embarrass me on my own stream?
[334:38.22]How dare you?
[334:48.91]Road trip stream.
[334:59.56]No, I'm not doing a driving stream.
[335:01.40]Are you crazy?
[335:15.19]Desert bus.
[335:19.33]Don't.
[335:19.63]I'm not gonna do a driving.
[335:21.71]If I go... If I go anywhere, it's not gonna be on stream.
[335:34.26]Alright, we gotta move.
[335:34.84]We gotta go.
[335:35.21]We gotta go.
[335:35.59]We gotta go.
[335:35.93]We gotta go.
[335:36.27]We gotta go.
[335:36.63]We gotta go.
[335:37.05]Move, move, move, move, move, move.
[335:38.65]It's Christmas.
[335:39.21]Come on.
[335:39.47]People have got places to go.
[335:43.04]Where were we?
[335:43.50]Oh, right.
[335:44.49]Martin had a meme thanks to the 2,000 bits.
[335:46.77]Scratch and sniff would be pretty cool, except you guys can't smell it.
[335:49.31]That'd be unfortunate.
[335:51.97]Hey, JBong, thanks for the 250.
[335:55.51]Sup, Jerma.
[335:55.91]Haven't been able to catch your streams for three days because I spent my time dealing with a huge sprained ankle.
[336:01.07]Not knowing how to ice skate plus sketchy rental skates don't make a good combo.
[336:06.41]That hurts.
[336:08.56]My ankle plumped up like a mango, and I'm bedbound for four to seven weeks.
[336:13.16]Oh my god.
[336:16.86]That's a long time.
[336:19.68]The doc said it was a grade three sprain.
[336:22.84]At least I'll be able to catch your famous yearly Christmas stream, right?
[336:27.97]Should we tell him?
[336:33.59]There's no Christmas stream this year.
[336:35.77]It's a New Year's Eve stream.
[336:39.19]You ever had to deal with a sprained ankle or a sprained limb on the first time?
[336:42.97]No, not really.
[336:45.64]I've had minor sprains.
[336:47.94]You know, minor twists on the ankle.
[336:50.86]Or, you know, on a wrist or something.
[336:52.46]But never something that put me in bed for like seven weeks.
[336:59.58]Have you ever broken a bone?
[337:01.21]No.
[337:02.23]Well, no, that's not true.
[337:03.15]I broke my collarbone.
[337:05.13]when I was two years old.
[337:07.30]I fell off a chair and shattered my collarbone.
[337:14.02]I don't remember.
[337:14.66]I don't know it.
[337:15.40]I don't remember it.
[337:16.08]I just know it happened.
[337:22.46]Wimp?
[337:23.68]Jesus.
[337:27.48]Weak bones.
[337:28.94]That's two.
[337:34.64]The very first fall joke.
[337:43.21]Thank you, Jay Blondell.
[337:45.17]I hope you get a swift recovery to you.
[337:47.61]I've never had a broken bone like that or a sprained ankle.
[337:50.37]It sounds like it's not very fun.
[337:54.21]I cracked my skull open when I was four.
[337:55.70]Beat that scrub.
[337:56.56]I did that too.
[337:58.89]I actually talked about that on stream when I was talking to Joel.
[338:02.27]I did that too.
[338:03.39]So you can't... There's no one up there.
[338:06.33]You and I are the same.
[338:09.33]Sorry.
[338:09.51]Sure.
[338:11.52]Did you get some of that?
[338:12.64]I released some.
[338:34.78]Sorting... That's what I was doing, the sorting algorithm.
[338:37.67]You didn't get any?
[338:38.47]Well, they went for you.
[338:43.35]Can we do sorting algorithms one more time?
[338:45.31]I'll do... No.
[338:48.01]Thank you, Yosher Master, and enjoy the jermaIQ power.
[338:58.15]Thank you, Nick Lee Bob, for the thousand bits.
[339:02.29]Thank you, Bob.
[339:05.66]$10.
[339:05.70]It's really nice to relax two streams after work.
[339:07.70]Thank you.
[339:09.26]Glad you can hang out and relax.
[339:13.74]Glad you can chill.
[339:19.88]Glad you can chill.
[339:22.36]ColdWarHall gave 10 community subs.
[339:23.91]Thank you.
[339:24.99]Ampharic, 10 community subs.
[339:26.23]I think we caught him, but seriously.
[339:27.27]What is this?
[339:28.07]Oh, let me mix.
[339:28.71]Let me see.
[339:29.15]Okay.
[339:29.73]I want to see how bad this is.
[339:31.86]Because I literally, people would, like I said, people wanted to burn my house down for this one.
[339:36.10]Let me see how bad this is.
[339:39.56]I've never looked over and seen chat tell me how much they want me to fucking, you know what I mean?
[339:46.43]How bad was it?
[339:46.93]Why would it give me a bonus?
[339:51.21]Jeremy, you've been playing the chicken game since July.
[339:54.33]Please stop.
[340:08.54]I did it.
[340:08.92]Yeah, he said it.
[340:12.46]Wasn't even that bad.
[340:18.75]That wasn't even that bad.
[340:19.87]You guys overreacted.
[340:20.87]Holy shit, you overreacted.
[340:24.67]Wow, what an overreaction to that.
[340:26.25]I can't believe it.
[340:26.89]You overreacted.
[340:27.67]Okay.
[340:28.03]Okay.
[340:34.65]That's an extreme overreaction.
[340:38.09]What is that music?
[340:46.21]Hey Sad Vega, thanks for the 250.
[340:50.25]So when can we expect the 10 ghost peppers to be eaten on stream or the 50,000 USD excluding tax subs?
[341:00.45]I think, I mean, if you want to go there,
[341:04.23]There were at least two or three times where I got 50,000 subs if I eat the 10 ghost peppers and this 50,000 subs I'm not gonna eat those so like literally I just like but let me just put this in like complete full quotation mark
[341:27.05]It doesn't matter how much money comes into the stream ever.
[341:31.98]I will never eat even one bite of one single ghost pepper ever on this stream for any reason.
[341:42.84]End quote.
[341:45.12]Ever.
[341:46.62]Ever.
[341:47.54]Ever.
[341:48.48]Ever.
[341:48.80]And I mean ever.
[341:49.60]And I mean ever.
[341:50.44]And I mean ever.
[341:51.24]And I mean ever.
[341:52.11]And I mean monkaOMEGA.
[341:53.63]I mean ever.
[341:54.75]monkaOMEGA.
[341:59.51]Why am I saying that today?
[342:01.11]I'm not sure why I'm into saying that now.
[342:08.23]I started the stream with that, didn't I?
[342:09.89]Why am I doing that?
[342:10.59]It doesn't make any sense.
[342:11.19]I don't know.
[342:13.29]Hey, Durbasucks5 community subs, we caught it.
[342:15.66]Thank you.
[342:18.06]Hey, KnitCat, thanks for the 1500 bits, $15.
[342:20.30]Here's your 15,000 subs.
[342:24.74]From Coke Gaming.
[342:26.30]It's not from Coke Gaming.
[342:28.06]That was a little satire parody joke that you just said.
[342:31.66]Don't get me in trouble.
[342:36.03]But thanks for the 1,500 bits.
[342:36.75]Appreciate it.
[342:42.01]Zol Nog.
[342:42.61]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[342:43.19]$5.
[342:43.21]No message.
[342:43.45]Just $5.
[342:44.23]500 bits.
[342:44.49]Thank you.
[342:49.84]Jamie, thanks for the five community subs.
[342:51.51]I think I caught these, but I may have been focused on pressing the button when the light lights up over and over again.
[342:58.19]Thank you, Jamie2803.
[343:00.59]Five community subs.
[343:01.35]Appreciate it.
[343:02.75]Tingy, five community subs.
[343:04.05]Loose Cannon, five community subs.
[343:05.65]And then we had the monster drop from Raggle Fwaggle.
[343:11.14]It was a 50 sub community drop from Raggle Fwaggle, which is insane.
[343:19.06]Thanks for the 5 million subs.
[343:20.38]Appreciate it.
[343:25.63]I remember catching these.
[343:28.03]CVFD.
[343:29.59]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[343:30.79]Thank you for OT showing that freak on stream.
[343:36.20]Thank you for OT.
[343:38.66]Oh, thank you for not showing that freak on stream.
[343:41.18]And I did.
[343:44.27]So, I'm sorry.
[343:47.85]CVFD, I did.
[343:49.87]I showed it.
[343:52.31]Thank you for the 500 bits, though.
[343:53.33]Appreciate it.
[343:54.73]Rafrod, thanks for the 500 bits.
[343:57.35]You ever tried Zevia?
[343:59.45]It's carbonated water and stevia leaf extract.
[344:01.87]It's really good.
[344:03.83]Nah, I just drink water.
[344:06.01]At that point, I just drink water.
[344:08.54]I know some people, oh, try this.
[344:10.54]It's seltzer water with two drops of watermelon juice, whatever.
[344:18.86]Nah, I'll just drink water.
[344:27.33]That sounds like water.
[344:28.75]Yeah.
[344:30.47]No, not White Claw.
[344:36.67]But no, I never had it.
[344:37.31]I usually, if I'm gonna drink... If I'm gonna drink carbonated water, it's gonna be probably some type of soda.
[344:46.64]Not just soda water.
[344:48.42]It's gonna be something else to it.
[344:51.51]But... It gives me... It makes me burp and shit.
[344:54.15]It gives me... It gives me a heartburn.
[344:58.81]Future gamer, thanks for the $2.50.
[345:00.07]Speaking of ads, I have a distinct memory of going to the movie theater and between movie ads, an ad playing in which a lady had bugs coming out of her bleeding eyes.
[345:08.57]It was super fucked up and I was 12 when I saw it.
[345:11.47]I have no clue what it was trying to sell, but it scared the shit out of me.
[345:18.53]That sounds horrible.
[345:19.67]What?
[345:21.41]Hopefully that was not during a Disney movie.
[345:28.87]That sounds insane.
[345:31.67]Thanks to the 250, though.
[345:32.59]That's fucked up.
[345:35.33]C4G, thanks to 250.
[345:36.55]Thank you for enabling peepoHappy.
[345:38.32]I love this little guy.
[345:39.30]Yeah.
[345:40.44]Of course.
[345:49.12]Everybody loves peepoHappy.
[345:53.16]It's a great little character.
[345:58.19]Thank you furikus or ferikus for the 500 bits.
[346:03.83]Never for any reason at any time ever for any purpose do that again.
[346:08.01]Apologize right now.
[346:09.17]jermaDisgust.
[346:11.07]It's the ayaya thing.
[346:14.39]It's the ayaya.
[346:15.21]Oh, I don't.
[346:15.89]I can't believe it.
[346:17.18]I'm going to scream because he said the thing that's like a meme that everybody's seen and no, he did it again.
[346:24.40]No, I didn't.
[346:25.08]I said it normally.
[346:28.32]You're not going to hear me do that again.
[346:29.94]Look, it's a... If you see this.
[346:33.39]No.
[346:34.01]No.
[346:34.29]Get rid of that.
[346:35.29]Get rid of that.
[346:36.13]I can't even delete it.
[346:38.23]Get rid of that.
[346:39.13]Don't do that.
[346:39.96]Don't do it.
[346:40.34]If you see it, you've already seen it.
[346:45.92]Darks, all thanks to the 250.
[346:47.20]I swear to God, if you have a mock...
[346:50.72]Kinero Mosaic again.
[346:52.94]I'm going to fucking sue you.
[346:54.24]Do you hear me?
[346:54.72]If you kiss the webcam with lipstick, I'll accept your apology.
[346:58.62]Nothing less.
[347:05.34]What is Kinero Mosaic?
[347:10.83]Is that a show?
[347:11.39]Is that the anime that the clip is from?
[347:12.87]I don't know.
[347:13.29]That's the anime it's from.
[347:29.30]I think you guys... There are some things that I don't realize how... Just how... Polarizing something is until I do it and then I see... That all my tires have been slashed.
[347:51.97]I will keep that in mind.
[347:53.37]Not apologizing, by the way.
[347:55.21]Gonna keep it in mind.
[347:56.85]Not an apology.
[347:58.41]Gonna keep it in mind.
[348:03.43]By the way, I'm sorry for doing that.
[348:04.75]Please don't be mad at me.
[348:07.67]Here, I put a lipstick on it.
[348:11.23]Yeah.
[348:19.67]AtmaStarfish, thanks for the 500 bits.
[348:21.33]Appreciate it.
[348:22.35]No message, just 500 bits.
[348:23.95]BoxBox came in with a huge raid.
[348:26.29]BoxBox, thank you again.
[348:27.71]That's like at least the second or third time that you've raided this channel.
[348:32.71]I'm going to have to come and hang out.
[348:34.67]I want to raid BoxBox.
[348:41.42]BoxBox has shown this channel so much love.
[348:48.88]Do sorting algorithm.
[348:54.51]But, no, seriously, thank you.
[348:56.27]You've shown this channel a ton of love, so I really appreciate it.
[349:01.97]We'll have to catch you when you're streaming one day.
[349:07.82]Thank you, though.

[349:17.31]Forehead.
[349:21.25]Demona Cucumber, thanks for the 250.
[349:23.12]I was watching your latest Nancy Drew stream in which you mistook some puffins for penguins, saying they eat penguins, to which I, quote, loudly responded, they're not penguins, they're puffins, you knob.
[349:33.40]I wanted to say sorry about that.
[349:34.60]I didn't mean it.
[349:35.20]Love the streams.
[349:35.82]Well, I didn't hear you.
[349:39.90]I just wanted to apologize for saying that into my screen.
[349:45.83]Well, you did just say it right now.
[349:47.09]Yeah, okay.
[349:47.87]I see.
[349:48.17]I feel you.
[349:52.94]Thank you, though.
[349:53.61]Thank you, Demonic.
[349:54.13]You're coming for the 250.
[349:54.65]Appreciate it.

[350:00.17]Ink6767.
[350:01.39]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to say that you're my favorite streamer and you're currently getting me through pretty bad times.
[350:05.67]Whenever I'm feeling shitty, I just throw on a Jerma VOD and it makes things that much better.
[350:12.62]Thank you, Ink.
[350:14.30]I'm sorry that you're going through some shit right now.
[350:19.17]Hopefully you get through it.

[350:24.49]Much love to you.
[350:26.85]Thanks for watching the stream.

[350:39.98]Hopefully we see you soon.
[350:43.62]ButSquire, thanks for the 500 bits.
[350:45.78]GTA Online got an update about two weeks ago that added arcades.
[350:50.02]So it'll be a really good follow-up game to the coin game.
[350:52.90]Are you serious?
[350:55.80]Also, I know how much you like Casino.
[350:57.08]Did they actually add that?
[350:57.88]They added an arcade in GTA 5 Online?
[351:04.69]I'll play it eventually.
[351:06.93]I know I will.
[351:10.71]We had Cyclops Parker gave... Looks like 10, 15 subs one by one.
[351:16.64]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6...
[351:22.61]1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12?
[351:30.01]Just one by one, just sub, sub, sub, sub, sub.
[351:33.05]Thank you.
[351:35.61]Thank you, Cyclops Parker, for all those subs.
[351:40.13]And speaking of those subs, let's switch over to the cleanup section of this movie theater.
[351:49.19]Let's put him on the screen right now.
[351:51.35]Roll it.
[351:53.08]All the community subs, there were a lot of them tonight.
[351:54.78]All the regular subs, all the long-term subs.
[351:56.86]Thanks a lot, guys.
[351:58.98]Wait, you got gifted a sub?
[351:59.98]Alright, let's see those emotes.
[352:05.84]Thanks a lot, guys, for your ridiculous support that you give this channel on a day-in and day-out basis.
[352:11.48]Thank you.
[352:17.87]We will finish up these bits.
[352:18.95]We had 250 from E-Word.
[352:20.47]Are you going to play Halo Reach again or are you going to wait for Halo 1 to come out because Halo Reach sucks?
[352:30.82]I don't know.
[352:32.58]I don't know.
[352:33.38]It was soiled for me.
[352:36.12]I don't know.
[352:36.92]I've never played Halo and I played for like an hour and then it was just... Maybe it's better that way.
[352:47.27]We'll see.
[352:49.53]Hey, Havegun, thanks for the 250.
[352:50.67]Hey, Jerma chat.
[352:51.72]Merry Christmas.
[352:52.28]I've been playing some of the classic LucasArts Star Wars games recently, and they still hold up pretty well.
[352:57.92]You ever considered playing the Dark Forces slash Jedi Knight games on stream?
[353:02.86]Also, California has a state lottery.
[353:05.68]Drive into this town.
[353:07.40]It's only about an hour or two from Vegas.
[353:09.40]I know.
[353:09.92]I know.
[353:12.86]I didn't know.
[353:14.22]He doesn't know.
[353:15.14]I didn't know.
[353:21.48]Classic LucasArts games, though.
[353:22.86]I remember there was a game.
[353:25.17]It was an old, old, old.
[353:27.47]Not... What was it called?
[353:31.99]Rogue?
[353:32.39]Not Rogue Squadron.
[353:34.53]What was the old Star Wars PC games?
[353:39.00]Republic Command?
[353:39.80]No, no, no, no, no.
[353:41.80]Maybe it was Dark Forces.
[353:43.76]It was one where you had to... It was sprites.
[353:47.02]And you had to peek up behind corners and shoot with a blaster.
[353:52.46]What was that one?
[353:53.42]It was old as shit.
[353:56.52]Rebel Strike?
[353:57.14]It might have been Rebel Strike.
[354:08.87]Yeah, it was very old.
[354:11.75]You had to peek up around corners and it was very, very, very sloppy.
[354:17.40]Maybe one day.
[354:18.10]Dark Forces looks familiar too.
[354:21.82]Galactic Battlegrounds?
[354:23.36]Yeah, maybe we'll do a Star Wars night.
[354:27.73]Try to get, like, five of these games.
[354:30.29]Six of them or something.
[354:32.19]Oh, how did I forget this?
[354:34.65]How did I forget this?
[354:35.79]I don't know how I forgot this.
[354:38.99]Guys, I have a 3DO now.
[354:42.09]We're gonna do 3DO.
[354:43.59]I own a 3DO now.
[354:45.44]How did I forget to tell you that?
[354:51.25]Omega Lola, why?
[354:56.37]Well... Because I wanted one!
[355:01.87]We're gonna play Gex!
[355:06.08]Also, there's like two or three full-motion video games that are on the 3DO that you can't get anywhere, and I wanna- and we're talking about original hardware.
[355:20.25]This guy's a retro gale, you bitch your ass.
[355:24.05]Gex is awesome.
[355:26.19]So I'm going to start collecting 3DO games.
[355:30.11]No, I didn't spend $700 on the 3DO.
[355:32.31]No.
[355:33.14]Go Gex.
[355:45.44]Plumbers don't wear ties.
[355:46.42]It's a porn game, right?
[355:48.14]I can't do that one.
[355:54.52]Let's finish up the bits.
[355:55.26]We had Bowser Jr.
[355:56.90]Streams.
[355:58.88]That'll be an interesting stream.
[356:00.16]Thanks for the 500 bits.
[356:02.60]Hi, Jerma.
[356:03.50]I've been watching your streams for a while now, and it's been really helpful with some hard times I've had.
[356:07.19]Wanted to show some thanks and love in any way that I could.
[356:10.23]Keep being an amazing person.
[356:11.71]Can't wait for more streams to come.
[356:14.39]Stay tuned.
[356:15.75]Hopefully you enjoy what is to come.
[356:20.55]Got stuff planned.
[356:22.33]I'll help you enjoy it.
[356:26.06]Like I did say previously, but I will say it again.
[356:30.16]I hope you can get through whatever it is that's causing you bullshit in your life.
[356:39.91]Thank you so much for watching.
[356:44.79]We also had 250 from Martin, had a meme.
[356:48.01]They say, can you explain this?
[356:49.37]Asking for a friend.
[356:53.69]Sure.
[356:54.54]Uh...
[356:56.19]Sure, yeah.
[356:57.41]I'll put this on stream.
[356:58.57]This is a very, very old image, what you have here.
[357:01.32]Uh, yeah.
[357:05.76]We can explain this.
[357:12.02]I mean, maybe I can't even explain this, but I'll try, I guess.
[357:14.88]Uh, I'll try to explain this, and in the best way that I can.
[357:18.71]I don't know.
[357:20.81]Wait, hold on.
[357:21.27]Is this the... How is this still here?

[357:57.27]That sounds like bullshit, but those are- hold on.
[358:01.63]Where is it?
[358:09.85]I believe these- I believe that is actually dog vitamins.
[358:15.76]What lotion container looks like that, guys?
[358:18.72]Have you ever seen a clo- that's not lotion.
[358:22.18]That is dog vitamins!
[358:31.33]They don't have necks that huge.
[358:36.13]Look at the shape of that container.
[358:37.55]I don't know.
[358:38.09]Look.
[358:38.81]Why is it... Guys, my room is a mess.

[359:08.09]Look at all this.
[359:08.47]It's a bunch of trash.
[359:13.19]Nobody even does that.
[359:14.37]It's a meme.
[359:15.10]It's like a jokey meme from every comedy movie back in like the 1990s.
[359:19.36]Nobody does that.
[359:22.54]Those are dog vitamins.
[359:24.26]Dog... I gotta look this up.
[359:25.60]Dog vitamin pump.
[359:33.55]Where is it?

[359:37.98]Enhance.
[359:38.32]It's dog vitamins.
[359:50.65]You have lotion in the mirror.
[359:52.59]That's not even... What do you think?
[359:54.67]I just have like three huge containers of lotion in my room.
[359:59.77]Sitting around for every scenario that could possibly come up.
[360:04.98]I gotta have just by the bed.
[360:06.50]Gotta have it by the computer.
[360:08.20]I have to have it next to me.
[360:09.28]That's a dog vitamins.
[360:17.92]Come on.
[360:18.86]I gotta find it.
[360:21.63]Or no, is it dog vitamins or is it a coffee flavor pump?
[360:39.80]That's not what it is.
[360:41.64]Who cares?
[360:42.72]What do I really care about my messy ass room?
[360:45.18]Look at the ground.
[360:51.04]You guys don't think that every time I made a video, I looked at what was in the Viewfinder and said, I don't care.
[360:57.93]Look at this fucking dirty ass room.
[361:08.75]He's deflecting.
[361:10.17]No, those are dog vitamins.
[361:11.43]I'm serious.
[361:12.09]They have to be.
[361:14.04]There's a poo stain.
[361:15.46]Oh, okay.
[361:16.14]That's funny.
[361:16.74]What do you mean?
[361:18.90]What are you talking about?
[361:26.06]Where's the shit stain?
[361:41.11]No, that's like a crumpled up McDonald's bag.
[361:43.03]That's not like shit stained diaper.
[361:46.65]That's like a crumpled up bag.
[361:47.95]That's not like a diaper with a shit in it.
[361:49.93]What are you talking about?
[361:54.09]That's a crumpled nut on the wall.
[361:58.94]That's like some wallpaper that's been torn off.
[362:04.16]I don't know.
[362:04.74]I opened the door too hard and I scraped the door.
[362:09.65]Guys, I don't know.
[362:11.01]You're talking about an image from like eight years ago.
[362:13.61]I don't know what that is.
[362:14.57]I scraped the door probably like 12 years ago.
[362:25.89]Anyways, where were we?
[362:27.31]Oh, right.
[362:27.71]I don't even remember.
[362:33.95]Oh, right, here we go.
[362:39.94]No, where did I... Somebody, like... Oh, Martin had a meme.
[362:43.80]250, can you explain this?
[362:44.96]Ask him.
[362:45.30]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[362:47.81]EC Long, thanks for the 300 bits.
[362:49.91]Hello, Jeremy.
[362:50.43]I've been subscribed to your YouTube since 2013.
[362:53.03]I haven't been able to catch the streams that often, but I love your content and your humor.
[362:57.56]You've brought years of joy to me, and it means... If it means anything, my son's middle name is Jeremy, and part of that is because of your influence over both my life and my wife's.
[363:07.32]Stay amazing, and hopefully I'll be able to see you around Twitch more.
[363:11.45]What an honor.
[363:12.69]What an absolute honor.
[363:14.85]I can't even believe that.
[363:18.39]Thank you so much for watching.
[363:20.33]If that much influence can have your... for some reason to have your son's middle name to be Jeremy.
[363:29.42]I don't even know what to say to that.
[363:30.50]That's incredibly touching.
[363:32.84]Thank you.
[363:38.94]I hope you stick around.
