[01:02.59]Hi!
[01:06.50]Hey!
[01:08.56]Welcome to the final day of Dinosaur Week, even though we've only played like... We've only played like five dinosaur games, or maybe four, but you know, dinosaurs, it's not about the quantity.
[01:20.78]It's about how we felt when we played them.
[01:23.42]How did you feel?
[01:29.79]How did you feel when you played it?
[01:32.54]I felt pretty great.
[01:34.56]No, tonight we're going to start with King Kong.
[01:36.90]King Kong, Peter Jackson presents the official, the movie, the game.
[01:41.66]Or, if you're paying attention, literally the worst video game title ever made.
[01:48.24]King, Peter Jackson presents King Kong, colon, the official game of the movie, the game.
[01:56.29]You couldn't have called it like King Kong, like Welcome to Outer Space or something?
[02:00.61]This is not a dinosaur game?
[02:01.73]Sorry, I'm sorry that you're incorrect about that, but it is a dinosaur game, actually.
[02:06.84]You play this game and fight a bunch of dinosaurs.
[02:10.52]And you play as King Kong, and you fucking fight the T-Rex.
[02:14.50]So... This is a dinosaur game.
[02:18.53]Come on.
[02:20.13]King Kong is my favorite dinosaur, too.
[02:25.31]And look, hey, if this game just, like, if this game's, like, not fun, then we go back to, there's, like, two other dinosaur games.
[02:33.32]Sir.
[02:35.54]Alright, give me one second.
[02:36.38]I'll be right back.
[02:37.54]See you guys in a few seconds.
[02:38.40]I'm gonna close my window, and I'm gonna get my drink ready, and I'm gonna tweet something, and y'all see in, like, two seconds.
[03:29.46]Alright.
[03:30.62]Let's get this going.
[03:33.00]Be careful, everybody.
[03:33.84]Here comes a very... I say it's a loud noise that's on the way, and I'm not joking here.
[03:38.15]So I'm going to just preemptively drop it to like 3%.
[03:40.09]Hopefully that helps.
[03:41.47]We'll find out.
[03:46.37]This is one of your favorite games, really.
[03:47.93]That's cool.
[03:52.68]Hopefully it's good.
[03:54.84]Let's get that up and running.
[03:58.11]Hey, Kingston.
[03:59.29]Yeah, see?
[03:59.83]Look at how loud this is.
[04:01.37]And I turned it down to like 5%.
[04:02.45]Alright, loading.
[04:09.04]We got the wicked loud-ass screen.
[04:11.44]There's me.
[04:12.88]I just want to make sure it worked.
[04:14.00]Okay, I think we can turn this back to normal now.
[04:17.02]Let's hope this isn't really loud.
[04:19.09]No.
[04:20.95]Okay.
[04:22.27]So, Peter...
[04:24.37]I want the cast and crew on the ship within the hour.
[04:26.31]We have three hours to find a new leading lady or we're finished.
[04:29.51]There are thousands of actresses out of work in this city.
[04:32.03]Somewhere out there is a woman born to play this role.
[04:47.21]Hold on, wait.
[04:48.23]Is this just a trailer for the movie?
[04:50.39]Did they show you that first?
[04:53.68]This is just a fucking trailer for the actual movie.
[05:19.62]I'm sorry.
[05:22.22]Are we just starting the game?
[05:23.56]What did I do?
[05:24.26]Did I press the wrong button?
[05:30.87]Hold on, so you just gave me like a trailer for the movie and now we're just going right into the game.
[05:35.65]Where was King Kong in that trailer?
[05:37.79]We didn't get to see anything.
[05:39.21]That was bullshit.
[05:40.69]We didn't actually get to see King Kong.
[05:44.04]It was just a bunch of fucking haphazard clips put together.
[05:50.58]This is really taking me out of the action.
[05:54.56]Is there more to this?
[06:02.53]Are you alright, Jake?
[06:03.63]Alright, the dog wanted to come in.
[06:22.54]Who am I?
[06:24.58]Wait, wait, wait.
[06:27.73]We gotta do some work here.
[06:28.77]Hold on.
[06:29.11]Audio.
[06:31.47]Voices can be turned up.
[06:32.97]Let's put the effects down.
[06:34.31]Maybe bring the master up a little.
[06:37.45]Okay.
[06:38.19]How does that sound?
[06:40.85]Better?
[06:43.17]Is that better or is it even worse?
[06:46.05]What am I looking at?
[06:48.69]Oh.
[06:50.89]It's okay!
[06:52.47]I'm feeling better.
[06:54.41]Can we please try and get these boats in the water?
[06:59.37]Oh, I'm in the water.
[07:00.69]Am I Jack Black?
[07:01.63]Hold on, it got worse?
[07:03.49]How did it get worse?
[07:04.28]Wait.
[07:09.28]Let's try that.
[07:11.92]That's better.
[07:12.34]Is this actually Jack Black talking?
[07:21.86]Or is this one of those voice actors that has a good Jack Black impression?
[07:24.74]Watch out for that eagle.
[07:25.42]Watch out for those eagles swarming.
[07:28.85]Let's go, boys.
[07:30.59]Hold on tight.
[07:31.27]This might get a little rough.
[07:34.33]Okay.
[07:35.33]I got the camera.
[07:36.07]I got my leading lady.
[07:37.43]Jack, stick with me.
[07:38.73]That is Jack Black.
[07:40.49]Preston, you got the film in the lenses?
[07:42.54]What is on his back?
[07:43.24]Is that like a machine gun?
[07:44.18]As much as I can carry.
[07:45.64]No, it's a camera.
[07:47.42]Good.
[07:48.24]Don't lose him.
[07:50.00]Okay, alright.
[07:51.77]Alright, when do we get to see the dinosaurs?
[07:53.25]Here comes the dinosaurs.
[07:57.04]See, they're making a movie.
[07:59.38]This is Peter Jackson.
[08:00.90]That's Peter Jackson.
[08:01.80]He's videotaping the movie, The Game, King Kong.
[08:06.19]See, he's filming the King Kong movie.
[08:08.19]I'm playing the game, watching him film King Kong, The Game, the movie, official Peter Jackson, The Game.
[08:14.59]Carl, the Kron is pulling us out!
[08:18.12]I thought that was going to crush those people.
[08:28.70]I thought that was actually going to crush those people.
[08:32.00]Those people are going to get crushed.
[08:35.49]There was a bunch of no-names over there.
[08:36.91]Guys, guys, there's no main characters on that boat.
[08:40.41]So that boat's going down.
[08:44.60]Don't worry.
[08:45.40]I promise you.
[08:46.06]I promise you the boat with no main characters is going to get crushed.
[08:49.35]See?
[08:50.05]Oh, come on.
[08:55.37]Oh, wait.
[08:55.61]Where are the ones that got crushed?
[09:01.34]By the way, I've never seen this movie.
[09:24.28]Should I watch this movie?
[09:25.20]Haven't they made like nine King Kongs?
[09:26.94]You know, guys, King Kong and Godzilla are the same movie to me.
[09:30.58]Oh, God.
[09:31.24]Why are you so loud?
[09:32.30]Why are you so bright?
[09:40.80]What the hell is going on?
[09:42.20]Stop this.
[09:44.72]Hey, Jack.
[09:45.86]You gave us a fright.
[09:48.58]So did your fucking face, right in my face.
[09:53.66]You're not saying those words.
[10:00.81]That's absolutely, like, not what you're saying.
[10:08.13]Yeah?
[10:08.69]What else?
[10:08.97]Is there anything else you need to tell?
[10:12.64]Watch out for those eagles!
[10:15.64]I'm telling you, the eagles are gonna be the fucking villains of this game.
[10:19.25]Turn.
[10:19.81]What is going... What is... Eagle horn.
[10:29.56]I told you.
[10:30.00]See?
[10:31.08]See?
[10:31.64]He's trying to shoot the eagles.
[10:33.14]Alright, this like... My mouse sensitivity is kind of all fucked up.
[10:50.03]Do I have to play this game in like a letterbox?
[10:52.99]This movie's gonna make so much money.
[10:55.64]Let's just concentrate on getting out of here alive.
[10:58.46]Oh, God.
[10:59.16]I have to play this in a letterbox.
[11:00.50]Yeah, it's too dark.
[11:02.16]I've got something that should help.
[11:08.88]Come on, let me punch him in the face.
[11:10.69]Let me punch him in the face, please.
[11:11.99]And let him just go like, ow!
[11:16.27]Ready?
[11:17.53]Let's get out of here.
[11:19.43]Come on.
[11:19.89]I know I got it.
[11:21.13]He's fantastic.
[11:22.33]Jack, come here.
[11:23.87]I got a weapon for you.
[11:26.47]Hold E to select Haze and then go to his weapon.
[11:29.35]What?
[11:31.59]Haze!
[11:33.28]He just like threw it.
[11:35.52]He did not just throw it over here.
[11:38.38]Press and hold space to aim your weapon and the left mouse button to shoot.
[11:41.60]Why are there no game sounds?
[11:46.74]Gotta reload.
[11:49.21]That's okay, I got enough magazines.
[11:51.63]Um, is there a way I can make this FOV not, like, 19?
[11:54.77]Oh yeah, these controls gotta change.
[12:07.54]Alright, just, like, sit back from your screens, everybody.
[12:11.70]So I don't need to walk in here?
[12:13.50]Oh my god.
[12:14.58]Okay, not bad for a city boy.
[12:17.84]Oh god, crabs.
[12:21.52]Not bad for a city boy.
[12:26.92]Alright, hey, this is gonna be the dinosaurs, I promise.
[12:30.61]I promise this is dinosaurs.
[12:34.25]Letterboxd low FOV shooter.
[12:39.67]What am I doing here?
[12:46.88]Once we get out of this cave, we'll be okay.
[12:48.87]See?
[12:49.45]Look, now the FOV is fine.
[12:55.57]Alright, let's make it to the cliff.
[13:05.38]Is this Kong?
[13:08.24]He says that and hasn't even seen the movie.
[13:10.26]I haven't seen the movie, you're right.
[13:13.92]Dinosaurs don't appear until 60% of the way through the game?
[13:17.26]What are you talking about?
[13:22.65]Are you telling me that dinosaurs don't appear until like halfway through this game?
[13:26.01]No, that's not true.
[13:27.21]I saw the movie.
[13:28.17]In the movie, the dinosaurs, like, you have to fight like three T-Rexes.
[13:40.43]I'm Adrian Brody, really.
[13:42.47]Okay.
[13:43.09]Ready to open it, Jack?
[13:47.26]So, give me the spoiler.
[13:48.60]At what point does the T-Rex show up?
[13:55.06]This game's supposed to be good.
[13:56.30]You're right, Carl.
[13:58.00]This island is fantastic, Jack.
[13:59.65]How do we get this open?
[14:02.59]What am I missing here in my cinematic FOV experience?
[14:05.77]Oh, here we go.
[14:06.61]Hang on, Jack.
[14:07.77]I'm coming.
[14:08.23]Ready to open it, Jack?
[14:09.77]Yeah, like three-fourths into the movie.
[14:16.37]You fight three T-Rexes as Kong?
[14:18.35]Alright, well how long is that gonna take?
[14:19.49]I wonder how many people are gonna throw up from this stream.
[14:23.95]What a great movie.
[14:24.73]Here we go, here comes a T-Rex!
[14:39.35]You guys trying to lie to me?
[14:40.51]Tell me the T-Rex shows up like halfway through the game?
[14:45.26]We're filming a movie right now?
[14:53.24]Oh no, more crabs!
[14:56.45]Look out!
[14:57.65]Look out!
[14:58.91]Get out of there!
[15:00.29]Watch out for that crab!
[15:04.08]Nice.
[15:04.74]You're doing a great job.
[15:06.30]Keep it up.
[15:07.12]Hold on, hold on.
[15:08.03]Wait, just- just wait a second.
[15:10.15]Wait, why does she have a sword?
[15:11.79]Where did she get a fucking sword?
[15:13.23]This guy's being- she's got like a bronze sword.
[15:27.22]Oh shit, do I have to- Fuck, I don't want to do this all over again.
[15:32.23]I don't want to do that again.
[15:33.13]No, good.
[15:33.41]We don't have to do it again.
[15:34.39]This is really easy.
[15:39.96]It's just like that, remember that shitty arcade game where the crabs were, you know, walking horizontally and you have to smash them with a little mallet?
[15:46.54]Hey, how many of you guys remember the Crocodile game?
[15:51.30]Remember the Crocodile game?
[15:53.20]Where they come out and it's like, nuh nuh nuh nuh, ROUCH!
[15:56.08]ROUCH!
[15:56.80]I'm gonna get you!
[15:57.92]ROUCH!
[15:58.52]ROUCH!
[15:58.88]ROUCH!
[15:59.72]And you just get like three of your friends, and everybody would be standing, there was like six crocodiles, and you'd have, each person would have two crocodiles, and you would get 100% of the whole thing.
[16:09.32]I love that fucking game.
[16:10.30]The game is amazing.
[16:12.26]What is going on?
[16:20.65]Should we just shoot it?
[16:23.35]Is he gonna get eaten again?
[16:24.31]It's a pretty sick fucking dinosaur.
[16:31.98]Hey, watch out Jack Black.
[16:33.08]You don't want to get eaten.
[16:41.64]Is he dead?
[16:42.22]Is Jack Black dead?
[16:46.84]Now he laughs.
[16:49.94]No, he bit me.
[17:00.31]That is a pretty cool dinosaur.
[17:08.24]I don't know why you would do this in real life.
[17:10.76]But, I mean...
[17:12.97]Imagine this just knocks me in my face.
[17:14.85]I just imagine me just going like, DUNK!
[17:17.35]Alright, what's sprint?
[17:27.26]Alright, go to the menu.
[17:28.04]Okay, remember, remind me to manually save.
[17:30.40]Because I'm going to forget that every time.
[17:42.18]Do you hear that?
[17:43.30]It sounds like a plane.
[17:46.01]It's Captain Englehorn.
[17:47.31]He spotted our distress signal.
[17:49.33]We really, really easily got up here.
[17:51.27]Down here!
[17:52.75]Captain Englehorn, we're here!
[17:57.16]What's he doing?
[17:58.42]He's leaving.
[17:59.14]Why isn't he landing?
[18:01.50]He needs to find a stretch of water that's protected from the storm.
[18:05.49]Everyone, hide.
[18:06.47]Give me that.
[18:06.91]How do I get that back?
[18:08.43]How do I get that spear back?
[18:11.95]Over there.
[18:13.97]He's dropped something.
[18:16.65]Yeah.
[18:17.05]Ooh, a crate.
[18:19.67]What's in here?
[18:22.97]We've got to get what's in the case.
[18:24.75]Okay, there's a shotgun.
[18:28.15]Okay, cool.
[18:29.15]Shotgun.
[18:29.69]You can only have one at a time.
[18:30.75]That's alright.
[18:35.09]I love how my face is leaning right into the barrel.
[18:37.67]This makes perfect sense.
[18:38.71]I love FOV.
[18:40.41]I love field of view.
[18:42.73]To hold the gun like this and have your eyesight look like this, I have to be pushing my head into my neck.
[18:53.78]Okay, let's go.
[18:57.10]Oh no, look out!
[18:57.70]Dude, this is scarier than Resident Evil.
[19:06.35]Where is the ammo?
[19:06.89]I don't think there is ammo.
[19:08.35]What are we hiding from?
[19:13.85]There's an FOV slider?
[19:15.13]No, there's not.
[19:15.87]Is there?
[19:17.57]Display mode 4?
[19:18.59]Why?
[19:18.89]What the fuck was that?
[19:24.24]No, that... What?
[19:26.90]Interface.
[19:28.48]Inventory subtitles.
[19:30.56]Controls video.
[19:31.92]16x9.
[19:33.80]Special mode and locked.
[19:35.16]Okay.
[19:37.66]Controls?
[19:40.70]No.
[19:44.44]Is it in like an INI?
[19:45.50]Is it like an INI file?
[19:49.81]That aspect ratio change didn't do anything, by the way.
[19:52.51]It actually made it worse.
[20:01.83]Jack control settings.
[20:03.03]Wait, you think so?
[20:15.38]No.
[20:16.74]Nope.
[20:21.88]I'm not sure there is one.
[20:23.75]Jack, I'm going to need your help with this.
[20:25.55]Very immersive black bars.
[20:26.91]Get over here and help me.
[20:31.30]Oh, we just thought Jack control settings was funny.
[20:33.89]Alright, hold on.
[20:37.69]Give me one second.
[20:39.39]I'm just curious.
[20:40.29]I just want to look at something.
[20:41.93]And in the meantime, I'm going to say thanks to a few people.
[20:45.18]I just want to see if there is an INI file where I can change the FOV.
[20:48.12]I'm going to do it.
[20:51.44]Give me one sec.
[20:52.96]In the meantime, though, thank you to Primrose the Great for $5.
[20:58.92]They say, oh god, crabs.
[21:00.66]This is true.
[21:01.14]You're going to be hearing some clicks in the background here.
[21:04.72]Thank you for the $5.
[21:05.34]Appreciate it.
[21:06.08]Also, Primrose again gave $10.
[21:07.75]So you gave $15 total so far.
[21:09.67]Thank you.
[21:10.91]Thank you so much, my friend.
[21:13.07]Jerma, this game has a 2.8 out of 10.
[21:14.79]You've made a very good choice.
[21:16.65]Hold on.
[21:16.89]That's not true.
[21:18.19]That is not true.
[21:20.36]You're talking about the DS game.
[21:22.54]The DS version of this game is fucking horrible.
[21:27.73]But not this one.
[21:30.71]Press I for invincibility.
[21:35.09]Peter Jackson's King Kong.
[21:36.61]I don't think there is an INI file, guys.
[21:39.98]Or like a editable file.
[21:44.72]Unfortunately.
[21:45.26]Let's check this.
[21:49.20]What does this do?
[21:52.30]There is a difference.
[21:53.64]Okay, I'm looking at this.
[21:55.84]Advanced.
[21:57.00]Gamma.
[21:58.72]That's not there.
[21:59.44]No, no, no.
[22:01.48]Nope.
[22:02.60]We're just going to have to puke.
[22:04.70]We're just going to have to puke, guys.
[22:05.98]I think we're just going to have to throw up.
[22:18.75]Aiming visor inventory.
[22:22.32]Let's see what the fuck that does.
[22:29.75]Oh, I can see, like, how many shots.
[22:30.91]I need, like, a hex editor.
[22:34.15]What the hell happened?
[22:35.89]Did this just... This got worse.
[22:39.11]I think this actually got worse because I went to 16x9.
[22:43.89]Did it?
[22:44.31]I can't even fucking tell.
[22:50.85]Alright, well whatever.
[22:51.41]We'll see how long we can deal with this for.
[22:57.87]Oh yeah, we can do this dumb thing.
[23:00.21]Alright, let's go.
[23:05.99]Go to the PC gaming wiki and do it.
[23:07.55]Alright, what?
[23:09.12]Something's not right here.
[23:12.50]You guys, what's going on?
[23:13.80]Do it.
[23:17.58]Do it.
[23:21.12]Are you using an emulator?
[23:21.96]No, I'm playing this from the disc.
[23:26.80]There is a fix.
[23:37.43]Pick up the other one on the floor, you fucking idiot.
[23:40.99]I wasn't playing the game right there.
[23:43.25]I was like trying to do FOV shit.
[23:44.79]Come on, give me a break.
[23:47.66]Like, I wasn't actually just playing the game right there.
[23:50.04]I'm, like, trying to figure out the FOV.
[23:53.42]The impatience!
[23:56.98]My goodness.
[24:02.57]Yeah, the ammo counter's up there.
[24:03.57]That's fine.
[24:10.41]Alright, well, if we're gonna do it, I wanna look it up right now.
[24:13.47]So let's take a look.
[24:16.09]Let's give her a look.
[24:23.32]Is it something as simple as changing an INI file?
[24:25.20]Let's find out.
[24:28.06]Oh, there we go.
[24:29.30]Oh, is it that easy?
[24:30.68]Is it that easy?
[24:33.14]I think it actually might be this easy.
[24:36.19]I think it's going to be this easy, guys.
[24:42.31]Okay.
[24:45.73]Yeah.
[24:46.55]Alright.
[24:47.55]Give me one sec.
[24:52.28]Here's the widescreen fix.
[25:02.20]Copy content of archive.
[25:03.35]Yeah.
[25:03.87]I just didn't think I was gonna need this.
[25:05.09]Okay.
[25:08.35]There it is.
[25:08.79]Hey!
[25:10.27]Okay.
[25:12.27]Oh, should I get the source code?
[25:15.03]I think I'm gonna get the fucking source code, guys.
[25:19.82]There it is.
[25:20.28]Okay.
[25:24.01]Hey, look at that.
[25:24.87]Let's see what happens when I do this.
[25:35.69]Gonna have to restart the game here.
[25:40.61]Gonna restart the video game.
[25:44.23]Just drag this in.
[25:49.21]Copy this to the King Kong folder.
[25:50.93]Alright, here we go.
[25:52.55]Hack the planet.
[25:54.44]Give me one second.
[25:55.26]I'm just going to switch over here.
[25:57.60]One sec.
[25:58.80]Two minutes tops.
[26:02.08]And yes, I will save the game.
[28:13.57]This is crashing the game over and over again.
[28:16.05]Oh, we got it, we got it.
[28:17.65]Whoa.
[28:17.97]Holy shit, what happened?
[28:21.49]What happened?
[28:23.17]I don't think this is correct.
[28:25.31]I don't think this is correct.
[28:28.18]Oh my god, this is not correct.

[32:54.67]Looks okay, right?
[32:55.47]Looks good.
[32:56.85]We're good.

[33:09.44]There we are.
[33:10.04]We got a full screen here.
[33:16.36]Okay, so.
[33:18.04]How do you guys like the new Gorillaz album?
[33:21.02]I think it's great.
[33:22.54]I think Moments should have been a lead single.
[33:25.02]I don't know why it wasn't a lead single.
[33:26.68]I don't even know why it wasn't a single at all.
[33:29.89]Moments on Humans is probably like the best song.
[33:32.55]It's great.
[33:40.17]It's very quality.
[33:45.72]Okay.
[33:49.12]Alright, enough of this shit.
[33:51.36]Hey, look at that.
[33:53.26]Is this like a game that has like not like a, it looks okay.
[33:57.17]I think I could deal with this.
[33:58.45]I think I can deal with this.
[33:59.85]What do you guys think?
[34:02.11]So what is it at right now?
[34:03.15]Video display mode.
[34:04.99]Bars or standard?
[34:06.09]Yeah, let's keep it on standard.
[34:09.40]That's like, that's a little bit better.
[34:13.58]I think I can handle this.
[34:17.12]We have an actual video game now that's at like 72 FOV, not like 40.
[34:21.40]Okay, good.
[34:26.52]Do you hear that?
[34:27.90]It sounds like a plane.
[34:28.84]We just have to redo all the jokes.
[34:30.64]It's Captain Englehorn.
[34:31.79]Just be ready.

[39:23.92]This is supposed to be a dinosaur week.
[39:27.66]Oh, there we go.
[39:34.02]Whoa!
[39:39.06]We're standing very close to this fire, by the way.
[39:43.38]Why doesn't everybody ignite the stick?
[39:45.16]I thought maybe I could just walk into it.
[39:46.56]You saw me try.
[39:47.16]Who's hunting ground?
[39:53.99]Now Jack keeps breaking the fourth wall, I know.
[39:58.32]Damn it.
[39:59.12]You hit a dead end.
[40:00.56]Looks like some kind of graveyard.
[40:03.26]This is the perfect place to shoot.
[40:06.00]This is exactly why you shoot on location.
[40:08.24]Authenticity, Jack.
[40:09.34]Okay.
[40:10.00]Real life.
[40:13.49]Take cover!
[40:14.15]There it is.
[40:14.75]Finally, the fucking dinosaurs show up.
[40:17.09]Here comes the dinosaurs.
[40:19.87]Out of here.
[40:20.85]They're gonna crawl out of that.
[40:21.87]It's gonna be the fucking Stegosaurus.
[40:25.62]No, it's just bugs.
[40:28.94]Just bugs.
[40:32.44]Hey, that's kind of a dinosaur, guys.
[40:34.68]This is a dinosaur.
[40:38.22]As much as you guys don't want to hear it, that's a dinosaur.
[40:40.96]Look it up.
[40:42.29]That's a... What's the dinosaur that has like 400 legs?
[40:46.33]A centipede?
[40:47.63]You know that centipedes are dinosaurs.
[40:49.03]They've been around for like 50 million years, you know, right?
[41:00.31]There's no fucking dinosaurs.
[41:03.48]Somebody go look at the back of the box for King Kong, the game, the movie, the official game.
[41:10.02]Look at all the dinosaurs there are.
[41:11.18]There's like T-Rexes, there's like fucking Velociraptors and shit.
[41:14.78]You won't get there.
[41:15.48]Just wait.
[41:16.88]Just wait.

[41:32.70]Excuse me, Mr. Denim.
[41:33.54]There are, without a doubt, dinosaurs.
[41:35.30]I'm close to the pterodactyl.
[41:37.30]Alright, you see, guys?
[41:39.44]Everybody calm down.
[41:40.28]We're almost at the... See?
[41:41.10]Here come the fucking pterodactyls.
[41:43.74]Right through the hole.
[41:44.66]Up here!
[41:45.52]Look!
[41:46.42]Open fire!
[41:48.71]Hide!
[41:51.79]No, it is gonna fight more fucking bugs.
[41:53.55]Everything open fire.
[41:57.49]Am I dying?
[41:59.39]And, and who?
[42:03.37]Alright, can we get out of here?
[42:10.94]We need to get to, I want to play as King Kong.
[42:12.76]When do I get to do that?
[42:15.34]That's like what I'm most looking forward to.
[42:21.36]I'll get him.
[42:22.65]He thinks he can be sneaky.
[42:26.31]We're all dying.
[42:30.96]There, see?
[42:31.72]No dinosaurs, huh?
[42:33.70]No dinosaurs?
[42:35.16]What do you call that, then?
[42:36.08]What do you call that?
[42:38.06]No dinosaurs.
[42:39.91]Oh, this is fucking dinosaur week, guys.
[42:43.51]You didn't think there was gonna be dinosaurs?
[42:45.07]Well, there's one.
[42:47.99]I mean, technically, that might be like a gnat.
[42:50.22]That might be like a mutated gnat.
[42:51.84]But no, it's a fucking dinosaur.
[42:54.19]That's a pterodactyl cougar bug.
[42:56.79]See?
[42:56.95]Do you remember those things from fucking the Jurassic period?
[43:00.18]Jesus.
[43:00.92]It's a man bat.
[43:12.38]They don't think I'm dying.
[43:13.25]Oh, I wish somebody was standing on that.
[43:18.93]Yeah, I can use this.
[43:24.15]What the fuck are you doing?
[43:31.86]Somebody's just gonna let her do that?
[43:33.98]Without a harness?
[43:37.56]It's not a safe thing.
[43:38.70]She's gonna fall.
[43:40.02]And there's gonna be like a huge moment.
[43:43.10]The fuck was that?
[43:44.88]What was that?
[43:45.54]Was that supposed to be suspenseful?
[43:53.29]This is not that suspenseful.
[43:59.16]This one is not hostile.
[44:07.34]I don't want to alarm you.
[44:08.38]You know when you're in somebody's house and there's a huge bug behind them and you don't want to tell them?
[44:13.42]Because you don't want them to freak the fuck out and get scared?
[44:15.71]That's kind of how I feel right now.
[44:16.87]I don't think she knows that's there.
[44:20.14]I have to, like, jump?
[44:20.74]I have to make that jump?
[44:22.86]Oh, no, I just go this way.
[44:23.64]Because if you say, if you freak the fuck out and say that there's a bug behind somebody, they're going to spin around and, like, attack and freak out.
[44:42.67]Kind of, like, does this thing... This is just here for, like, fun, I think.
[44:45.63]This is just here for aesthetics.
[44:46.63]It doesn't actually do anything.
[44:52.51]See ya.
[44:53.87]Okay, bye.
[44:58.01]See?
[44:58.61]There's your pterodactyl.
[45:03.21]There's your fucking pterodactyl coming at me right now.
[45:05.53]See?
[45:05.77]It's like a scary pterodactyl.
[45:07.09]What?
[45:08.33]So they eat each other?
[45:22.82]Are you telling me that that thing can't... Why do they die?
[45:25.85]Oh, I thought they just died.
[45:31.33]Scaradactyl.
[45:35.43]Pretty cool scaradactyl.
[45:37.65]Alright, give me your weapon.
[45:39.07]What do you think I'm doing?
[45:54.36]Okay.
[45:55.86]Sure.
[45:56.78]Where'd the other two go?
[45:57.96]Why are they not here?
[46:00.84]Should I climb up this?
[46:01.66]Maybe I should climb up here.
[46:02.94]Nope.
[46:05.99]I'll take care of the... Where are you going?
[46:11.39]I got you covered.
[46:13.11]Alright, what do you think the over-under is before we see a real dinosaur?
[46:24.04]Look out behind you.
[46:26.18]Kind of.
[46:27.44]Not.
[46:30.22]That was a little baby pterodactyl.
[46:33.06]Oh, God.
[46:33.54]Here come more bugs.
[46:37.07]Okay.
[46:38.83]Were there bugs in this game?
[46:40.55]Like, in this movie?
[46:42.33]Try to eat some food?
[46:43.95]No.
[46:45.41]We just burn them.
[46:45.95]Just burn the fuck out of them.
[46:56.94]oh alright good we're good okay I'm not gonna hit I'm not gonna skip this now bug week you didn't like Saturn bars so I I Saturn bars is a weird song I I feel like you kind of have to listen to it a bunch of times before you just grows on you but the gorillas are like that
[47:21.39]half the gorilla songs that I've ever heard.
[47:23.81]I'm like, eh, that was okay.
[47:26.91]And then like, after I listened to it two or three more times, I'm like, yeah, that was, that was pretty cool.
[47:31.59]And then I actually ended up liking it.
[47:35.91]Don't skip this.
[47:36.59]Sorry.

[48:12.81]That was a good throw.
[48:16.66]Almost there.
[48:21.97]Almost there.
[48:22.55]And then we're going to hear... T-Rex!
[48:29.32]I actually can't wait for that.
[48:31.34]I'm looking forward to it.
[48:32.58]Look out, Anne!
[48:50.22]Why would I want to zoom in?
[48:52.62]Save, save, save.
[49:00.86]I don't think she can die.
[49:03.48]I'm fairly certain she will not die here.
[49:06.28]From these giant pterodactyls.
[49:08.22]Now they're looking at me.
[49:11.56]She just speared through her body.
[49:18.02]Somebody speared her.
[49:20.49]And now it's playing this, like, fucking music.
[49:22.29]That means I'm gonna die.
[49:27.01]Will she do something?
[49:32.81]She's not doing anything.
[49:35.31]Yeah, thanks to you.
[49:38.17]Oh, there's a wall over there.
[49:38.97]It's huge.
[49:41.13]What?
[49:41.85]What is going on?
[49:42.41]Dinosaur?
[49:42.97]There's a dinosaur in there.
[49:51.08]I think it's a swim.
[49:55.04]Isn't there a scary monster in here?
[50:00.41]I'm gonna get jumpscared.
[50:01.55]Watch.
[50:23.84]Look, once we get to see the first dinosaur, that's when we can stop playing.
[50:26.81]We can move on to the next game.
[50:29.19]But I need to see a dinosaur.
[50:31.35]It's important.
[50:34.13]Grab my hand.
[50:35.61]Alright, thanks.
[50:44.02]Is this entire game an escort mission?
[50:45.66]It feels like it.
[50:46.66]Hopefully it's not.
[50:47.32]They're the eagles.
[50:57.66]It's just bugs.
[51:01.20]Like, was there this many bugs in this movie?
[51:11.47]I think he's still alive.
[51:16.31]Alright.
[51:19.15]Alright, we're getting close.
[51:23.93]We're getting close to go to the next game.
[51:27.66]We'll see.
[51:28.70]There are the eagles.
[51:33.47]God damn it, I missed.
[51:35.59]Bugs is all I can remember now.
[51:47.00]Bugs and eagles.
[51:59.61]Almost.
[52:04.59]Yeah, I know.
[52:05.39]You have to light this shit on fire.
[52:07.36]Yep.
[52:10.44]I played a game from 2005.
[52:13.64]Why does the gun make no noise?
[52:15.04]I don't know.
[52:15.52]That's true.
[52:16.72]It doesn't... How the hell did they get over here?
[52:22.88]Weren't they stuck?
[52:23.52]Pace!
[52:24.63]Over here!
[52:26.94]I thought these guys were locked away somewhere.
[52:29.04]Where'd you get the sniper rifle?
[52:30.74]King Kong is just a giant bug.
[52:32.79]No, I don't want to use that.
[52:35.87]Okay, now I have to.
[52:58.30]Okay.
[53:00.62]Drop what?
[53:06.56]Is this the game of the Jack Black movie?
[53:14.25]Wait, why does it say the movie, the game?
[53:16.13]King Kong has always been a movie.
[53:17.59]It's not a- Loud noise!
[53:18.59]Here comes loud noises.
[53:19.35]It's gonna play a random, blurry cutscene for no reason.
[53:25.98]But anyways, oh, shit.
[53:28.62]My CLR browser.
[53:30.56]Let me get that loaded back up.
[53:32.90]There's going to be a loud noise here.
[53:41.19]I'm getting... I'm getting real close to being annoyed that on the back of the box on King Kong the movie, the video game, presented officially by Peter Jackson, I saw a shitload of dinosaurs.
[53:55.16]And I don't say... All I see is shitty bugs.
[53:59.15]Here it comes, I told you what I tell you.
[54:00.31]Easy.
[54:07.81]What is the purpose of this happening?
[54:11.29]Why do they have to do that?
[54:12.15]The game already loaded.
[54:15.43]The game loaded already.
[54:19.11]Why does it have to do that?
[54:28.50]No, here we go.
[54:30.42]What?
[54:30.78]Hey, what the fuck?

[54:47.31]What the hell are you doing?
[54:48.29]You didn't do anything.
[54:54.00]I say, I got you, I got you.
[54:56.42]You're safe, you're fine.
[54:58.56]Just no clip to Kong, what is she doing?
[55:02.25]Why is she crawling?
[55:05.77]Oh no, my arm hurts, I have to like gently slide my finger on it.
[55:11.65]Where the fuck is King Kong?
[55:17.30]Look at that.
[55:18.30]That was a fucking headshot, just end all headshots.

[56:01.76]Yeah, pretty sick bug week.
[56:05.06]What do you say, guys?
[56:07.42]Yeah.
[56:07.70]Uh, I know.
[56:12.45]Like, oh, there's a little spot to go.
[56:14.35]Okay.
[56:17.09]Well, don't go over there.
[56:21.83]What, are you crazy?
[56:22.63]Alright, somebody look up the sheets.
[56:29.17]Alright, look at the cheats.
[56:33.64]How do we get to the dinosaur part?
[56:38.72]How did she know that?
[56:40.60]There was no way for her to know that.
[56:41.66]There's a guy.
[56:42.00]There's a fucking person.
[56:43.78]Human.
[56:47.89]There's zombies in this game.
[56:53.15]Why are there zombies?
[56:54.25]Are there zombies in fucking King Kong?
[57:00.39]This guy's breathing is giving me anxiety.
[57:10.33]Almost there.
[57:10.83]That's a double kill.
[57:14.59]I'll take it.
[57:14.99]Okay, I gotta go way higher than that.
[57:21.42]You know what, just fucking shoot the damn thing.
[57:22.78]Alright, out of ammo.
[57:33.53]I had to steal that back.
[57:34.73]That was kind of cool, actually.
[57:37.55]That was, like, slightly cool.
[57:43.14]Human week is the best week.
[57:45.20]Like, a human week.
[57:48.16]Alright, yeah.
[57:54.04]You got it.
[57:57.21]Actually, it's kind of fun throwing stuff at people, though.
[57:59.27]I will say.
[58:04.44]Yeah, you're gonna actually do some work here?
[58:10.11]Well, I guess they're just gonna never-ending spawn.
[58:14.03]That was too high.
[58:16.21]It was too low.
[58:18.51]That was just right.
[58:19.35]What about down there?
[58:22.70]Perfect.
[58:23.06]First fucking try.
[58:24.14]First try on that one.
[58:33.14]Okay.
[58:34.50]I'm ready to see... ...Ting-Kong and the dinosaurs.
[58:45.15]I'm gonna be so excited when we get to actually see the dinosaurs.
[58:51.05]Here we are.
[58:54.49]Be careful, Anne.
[58:55.47]I wish I could jump.
[58:56.83]Oh, her name actually is Anne.
[59:04.32]Jerma and the three javelins.
[59:06.88]Come on, I'm disappointing all the people watching.
[59:11.85]Everyone expected dinosaurs and we haven't seen any.
[59:14.19]Well, we've seen one.
[59:15.13]We've seen one.
[59:16.37]We've seen one.
[59:21.12]Are you fucking for real?
[59:24.56]You can't get up that.
[59:30.20]What?
[59:34.24]I can't get up that.
[59:39.57]Hold on, let's go to Jack controls.
[59:43.07]There is no jump.
[59:48.13]Okay, there's no jump.
[59:55.86]So, I have to go this way.
[60:08.36]Am I stuck down here?
[60:09.92]Nothing left.
[60:11.61]I'm dry.
[60:15.19]No, this has got to be something I can climb on.
[60:17.57]I do, right?
[60:24.90]What about back here?
[60:31.74]What?
[60:35.06]No bullets left.
[60:42.09]I can't step up this.
[60:45.94]Why?
[60:46.34]Are you kidding me?
[60:49.92]Where's Anne?
[60:52.78]Anne?
[60:53.94]Where did you go?
[60:54.56]Well, there's my only means of getting away.
[61:02.67]She went up there.
[61:04.09]We're good.
[61:11.95]We're okay.
[61:14.07]We're good.
[61:15.57]We made it up the stairs.
[61:16.39]We just had to walk up them.
[61:18.14]And it didn't work.
[61:19.66]I don't want to go on... I don't want to do this.
[61:21.88]I want to... I'm scared to go over here.
[61:31.09]Am I supposed to go over here?
[61:34.61]Where in the name of God am I supposed to go?
[61:36.19]Oh, there she goes.
[61:37.33]You alright, Anne?
[61:42.66]What are you talking about?
[61:45.06]I'm scared to go in this water.
[61:56.19]I can't go over there.
[61:59.19]If I go in here, is she going to open the fucking door?
[62:03.48]I hope you open the door.
[62:04.34]Oh, thank God she's going to open the door.
[62:06.52]My fucking Lord.

[63:15.39]Oh god, here's the loud noises.
[63:25.35]Sorry, by the way.
[63:26.21]They decided to show a random cutscene for no reason.
[63:29.19]There's dinosaurs on this level.
[63:31.40]Okay.
[63:32.38]Well, I'm looking forward to it.
[63:35.69]We got dinosaurs.

[63:53.64]The T-Rex is gonna come and save me, right?
[64:00.47]I don't think I can do anything.
[64:01.61]Wait.
[64:02.63]No?
[64:04.31]Alright, where is she?
[64:05.09]Where is she?
[64:09.81]Where's the key?
[64:13.95]No.
[64:15.37]Oh no, they're just going to burn her.
[64:19.31]No, this is where King Kong comes over and he grabs her and runs away and then we fight the T-Rex.
[64:27.50]I've never seen the movie.
[64:29.84]Why would a T-Rex save you?
[64:31.06]Because that happened in Jurassic Park.
[64:33.38]Don't you remember Jurassic Park?
[64:35.41]Bless you.
[64:36.43]Remember Jurassic Park?
[64:38.25]When the fucking T-Rex came down and like saved everybody from the raptors?
[64:41.71]Yeah, this is like real dragged out, by the way.
[64:53.40]See, King Kong's gonna come and save her.
[64:56.88]Watch.
[64:59.21]There he is.
[64:59.81]There's King Kong.
[65:01.75]He's like, oh, what have they done to you?
[65:03.49]Oh, I'll rescue you!
[65:06.88]Oh, what the fuck are they doing?
[65:10.11]Let me get you out of here.
[65:11.01]Let me stretch my back first.
[65:13.21]Oh, yeah, that feels nice.
[65:15.21]Yeah.
[65:16.53]Why is he... I don't hear anything.
[65:22.89]Okay, now I'm just going to pick you up real easy.
[65:25.45]There we go.
[65:26.61]And... Okay.
[65:27.91]You've been rescued.
[65:28.67]There he is.
[65:37.22]Whoa, that was a pretty cool dinosaur.
[65:40.88]He just must have gotten done driving his car.
[65:49.47]Do I just sit here for the rest of the game?
[65:54.87]I don't think I can get out of this.
[65:57.57]I think I just sit here for the rest of this game.
[66:00.51]Oh, there's a person.
[66:01.73]Oh, look, a guy got in here.
[66:03.22]He got away from him.
[66:05.07]Where the fuck did he come from?
[66:06.33]Yeah, it's me, Jack Black.
[66:07.17]I came out of fucking nowhere.
[66:08.37]Hey, Jack.
[66:08.55]Alright, hurry up.
[66:08.93]He looks like Matthew Perry.
[66:10.97]He does look like Matthew Perry.
[66:12.22]We should hit him for that.
[66:35.00]Just pretend I hit him.
[66:36.84]Okay, this way.
[66:38.16]So you guys... Somebody said don't skip.
[66:39.79]They're like, I beg you, don't skip.
[66:41.13]Why?
[66:42.59]Do we get to actually see, like... Is there, like, a dinosaur?
[66:48.13]Hopefully we get to actually see dinosaurs.
[66:49.41]Because I'm going to be very upset if we don't get to see one soon.
[66:52.09]Apparently they're supposed to have, like, a sense of urgency here.
[66:54.24]I think they're angry that we got out.
[66:59.10]He got hit by that.
[67:01.24]He got hit right in the back.
[67:02.06]Wait...
[67:06.20]This way?
[67:06.60]Okay, I guess this way.
[67:08.31]Come on.
[67:10.85]When we... T-Rex right there.
[67:12.61]There he is.
[67:13.51]Come on.
[67:13.99]Over where?
[67:14.27]No.
[67:35.01]Subscribe for dinosaurs.
[67:36.49]It got bugs.
[67:40.32]I'm sorry, guys.
[67:41.56]Did you read the back of the box?
[67:44.80]It was very clear.
[67:45.62]Uh, we gotta get through that door.
[67:49.96]There's no other way.
[67:51.56]Okay.
[67:52.37]Well, one of us has to touch this thing.
[67:56.23]Do I have to?
[67:56.83]I have to find it.
[67:57.45]No, come on.
[67:57.97]I don't want to do this shit.
[68:00.41]I can't just, like, wedge...
[68:04.52]Where's the other one?
[68:05.14]There's one just lying around somewhere, right?
[68:08.92]Don't ask me where the hell it is.
[68:11.24]And I probably already missed it because I'm just a fucking moron.
[68:14.81]Let's see.
[68:17.59]Oops, sorry.
[68:19.93]I love how he's hiding over here.
[68:22.15]He's just hiding in the corner.
[68:23.89]See?
[68:24.51]I told you.
[68:32.15]I told you that these are fucking dinosaurs.
[68:35.37]Oh no, that's a dinosaur!
[68:36.87]There's a dinosaur!
[68:38.23]Hey look, dinosaur week!
[68:39.33]We finally got what we wanted!
[68:42.48]Oh yes, a dinosaur!
[68:45.02]Okay, hi.
[68:47.06]Wait, I'm in his mouth.
[68:50.00]Alright, get it set up.
[68:50.90]Get the camera set up.
[68:53.75]Mom, get the camera.
[68:54.65]This is our first dinosaur of the year.
[69:03.42]Oh my god!
[69:04.76]Look, he's just as excited as all of us are.
[69:09.57]Where is he?
[69:13.19]He's over here.
[69:13.59]Alright, here he comes, here he comes.
[69:14.57]Alright.
[69:15.31]Here we go.
[69:16.03]Set up the camera.
[69:18.37]Dude, this is Twitch chat.
[69:19.37]Like, set up the camera and look at that fucking dinosaur so I can get it recorded so people know that this actually was a dinosaur stream.
[69:26.47]My fucking god.
[69:27.36]This dinosaur sucks.
[69:33.74]Like, how... Can't you just kill that bug?
[69:40.82]Alright, you know what?
[69:41.46]I've had enough.
[69:43.45]It's time just to stab him.
[69:45.85]No, okay, we're not gonna stab him.
[69:47.15]Do I have a gun?
[69:48.09]No, I don't.
[69:48.57]Like, can we just get out of here?
[69:52.77]Ugh!
[69:54.28]Like, how many times do I have to do this?
[70:00.49]Oh god.
[70:01.59]I love how he just, like, runs across.
[70:03.67]This is so stupid.
[70:05.49]Oh shit, the tables have turned.
[70:06.73]The centipede is now eating the dinosaur.
[70:10.99]Oh, the circle of life is so cruel!
[70:14.23]Humans always win.
[70:16.52]It's always the humans that get the last laugh.
[70:18.42]Alright, let's open the fucking door.
[70:23.65]This is not another one, is there?
[70:24.53]Oh, God.
[70:26.85]Fuck off.
[70:31.04]Okay.
[70:33.74]Why does it feel like the only dinosaur in the whole game?
[70:39.93]Knock this down.
[70:40.83]There it is.
[70:41.19]Did you see the size of his arm?
[70:48.37]Okay, these are these are more dinosaurs.
[70:50.17]There's even more dinosaurs.
[70:52.01]They're really tapping the tagging the dinosaurs on right now, aren't they?
[70:57.59]Right in the face.
[71:00.08]Double face shot.
[71:00.88]Alright, I gotta get that thing.
[71:06.74]It's a pretty good bug dinosaur weak stream, yeah.
[71:13.07]Go, go, go, go, go.
[71:13.73]Alright, I'll get this one.
[71:15.45]You get that one.
[71:15.87]Go.
[71:17.87]Go.
[71:18.05]You hanging in there, Carl?
[71:19.19]No, I don't care how he's doing.
[71:20.57]I want to move the thing.
[71:24.02]You alright, Carl?
[71:25.16]No, I don't care how Carl is doing.
[71:27.08]I want to move this device.
[71:29.30]You ready?
[71:29.84]I'm going the wrong way.
[71:32.26]There we go.
[71:35.04]I thought these things were supposed to be extinct.
[71:37.18]Vampires.
[71:40.88]Well, they are now.
[71:42.88]Why does Jack Black make everything better?
[71:44.12]Because Jack Black is just great at, you know, everything he does.
[71:48.27]I love how my name is Jack.
[71:51.69]Okay.
[71:56.41]Loud.
[71:56.69]Very loud.
[71:57.13]Here comes the loud noise.
[71:58.27]And the game crashed.
[71:59.49]And I didn't save it.
[72:00.73]So, alright.
[72:01.33]Let's play the next game.
[72:02.95]The game has crashed and I didn't save it.
[72:04.91]There's your dinosaur.
[72:05.89]At least we got to see a dinosaur.
[72:08.65]Okay.
[72:09.03]There's your fucking dinosaur.
[72:12.05]Now I have to, like, control-alt-delete.
[72:15.21]So that's great for us.
[72:18.19]Okay.
[72:23.15]Actually, well, hold on.
[72:24.97]Give me one second.
[72:27.58]Let me see if I can just get to, like, the fight the T-Rex level.
[72:31.42]Give me one second.
[72:32.32]I'll be back in, like, three minutes.
[72:34.76]Not even.
[73:31.92]Alright, well, it might take a little too long.
[73:35.89]So, fuck it.
[73:36.17]We're going to move on to the next game.
[73:37.19]We're going to move on to... This one is an oldie.
[73:41.41]Hope you guys are ready for this.
[73:42.43]At least we got to see one dinosaur.
[73:44.11]At least I'm happy about that.
[73:46.43]Let me get the next one open.
[73:47.67]Cover your ears.
[73:48.72]Because this one's... Actually, maybe not.
[73:50.12]We'll find out.
[73:51.56]We'll see how loud this is going to be.
[73:55.46]Are we loud?
[73:56.08]Are we really loud?
[73:57.40]That's okay.
[73:59.58]You can hear that clock ticking.
[74:03.29]Hopefully this game doesn't fucking suck.
[74:08.17]It's probably gonna be so bad, though.
[74:12.02]Of course, guys, of course.
[74:13.08]I'm talking about Time Commando.
[74:16.60]You start this game, you go back in time and fight the fucking dinosaurs.
[74:24.54]So get ready.
[74:26.77]Here we fucking go.
[74:27.79]I'm gonna change the title, hold on.
[74:38.03]Let's just call the title Time Commando.
[74:40.53]Don't matter.
[74:45.63]And my Twitch!
[74:48.03]My Twitch chat also crashed.
[74:49.49]Why the fuck does this keep happening?
[74:52.68]I swear to God, like, the last, like, five streams, my Twitch chat just stops working.
[74:59.88]Like, halfway through.
[75:00.52]It's really... I don't know why it's for some reason on this computer.
[75:06.30]Alright, let's do this.
[75:08.74]Let me just get a new chat popped up.
[75:13.13]Hey, there you guys are.
[75:14.71]Now I can see you.
[75:15.57]Alright, and let's get started.
[75:21.01]I have no idea.
[75:22.89]This game might be an immediate next.
[75:26.89]We'll find out.
[75:29.29]So, start game.
[75:30.53]We're obviously gonna do a new game.
[75:34.81]Not very easy.
[75:36.17]Normal.
[75:39.13]This is Time Commando.
[75:43.91]Hopefully this game has dinosaurs.
[75:46.75]Pre-history level 1, difficulty normal.
[75:51.57]Here we go.
[75:53.33]Play.
[75:56.05]This game is an action-adventure game where you fight dinosaurs.
[76:02.72]This is an action-adventure game where you fight fucking dinosaurs and by dinosaurs I mean like these people This is like an MS-DOS game, but it looked like it was gonna be fun How do I fight?
[76:14.51]How do I punch people?
[76:20.67]Watch me how I- look this guy's got like a dinosaur like costume on
[76:29.40]Just wait, wait till we get to a dinosaur, please, before you say next.
[76:32.34]Let's get to a dinosaur first.
[76:36.34]Before anybody freaks- Hey, look, a dinosaur!
[76:39.02]That's a saber-toothed dinosaur!
[76:43.95]The saber-toothed dinosaur, don't you guys remember?
[76:50.17]It's the first boss.
[76:56.04]Punch him!
[77:00.63]I think I'm, like, gonna die.
[77:01.89]I don't even know where I am.
[77:04.59]I'm stuck in, like, the corner.
[77:07.37]Previous.
[77:08.51]Previous.
[77:12.49]This game is not terrible.
[77:15.49]Don't say that about Time Commando.
[77:17.37]It's a big deal.
[77:19.17]Got him.
[77:22.41]Alright, we're... We're not... No, this is not next.
[77:25.29]Are you serious?
[77:26.89]We're not doing next yet.
[77:28.74]This game was like fucking 72 dollars.
[77:30.74]They were not doing next.
[77:35.98]No, Turok is not next.
[77:37.50]I can tell you what's next.
[77:39.48]And it's actually a game we can all play together.
[77:41.44]If you have it.
[77:48.55]Oh god, this dinosaur has a club.
[77:51.39]It's weird how these dinosaurs can walk on their hind legs.
[77:54.65]Oh shit.
[78:00.04]Did I actually spend cloud company?
[78:01.66]Alright, well that dinosaur threw a rock at me and killed me.
[78:05.06]So there goes that.
[78:05.94]Game over.
[78:06.86]Alright, so let's do the start code.
[78:17.80]See if we can get back there.
[78:20.50]Alright, A-X-Z-A-A-D-D-D.
[78:25.40]Oh shit.
[78:27.88]No, it's not Dino D-Day.
[78:31.71]Next, never again.
[78:36.19]Alright, alright, hold on.
[78:37.53]Everybody calm down.
[78:38.73]Time Commando sucks.
[78:40.50]It's alright.
[78:41.64]Don't worry about it.
[78:42.48]We're gonna move on to the next one.
[78:46.02]The next one is a game that a lot of you might even actually own.
[78:48.80]And it is... Primal Carnage Extinction.
[78:54.60]Primal Carnage Extinction.
[78:57.80]At least we get to see the saber-toothed dinosaur.
[79:00.72]So if you have Primal Carnage Extinction, maybe we can just hop on a random server and we'll have some fun.
[79:10.40]So before we do that, though, let me just pee.
[79:12.91]I'll be right back.
[79:13.49]And we're going to play Primal Carnage Extinction.
[79:16.79]I'll be right back.
[80:41.37]I still haven't gone pee.
[80:42.75]I'm just getting the game ready.
[80:44.09]I'll be right back.
[82:28.83]Alright, guys.
[82:29.81]Here we go.
[82:32.59]If you have Primal Carnage Extinction, give it a go.
[82:37.99]And we'll see.
[82:38.67]I've never played this game, actually.
[82:39.81]I have no idea what to expect.
[82:43.07]Okay, so here we are.
[82:45.53]Multiplayer.
[82:47.43]Just gonna... You'll see what server I'm going into, I guess.
[82:50.41]I don't know...
[82:52.79]Oh, shit, speaking of fucking... Hold on.
[82:55.11]Let me say some, uh, thank yous here.

[82:59.79]Thank you, Baron Von Baby, for the 15 bucks.
[83:02.35]Speaking of clown cars, what car would you like to own?
[83:04.55]A Mini or something else that matches your height?
[83:06.77]Well, because, I mean, I would say probably a, uh... One of those, like, RC cars would be my favorite.
[83:14.77]The, uh... What's the one that could drive on both sides?
[83:17.27]Used to have it.
[83:19.05]Like, when you... The rotate, the recoil.
[83:22.13]What's it called?
[83:22.51]The thing that can drive as an RC car on both sides.
[83:26.76]Whatever it was.
[83:27.72]But that's what I want.
[83:28.30]KXE, thanks for the 10 bucks.
[83:30.12]Question.
[83:30.38]If someone wanted to gift you a game, how would they do that?
[83:32.54]They wouldn't because I don't accept Steam gifts.
[83:34.46]I don't, like, want them.
[83:35.90]I will buy my own games.
[83:36.82]I really appreciate the offer, though.
[83:38.10]But I would rather just buy my own games.
[83:40.32]Thank you, though, so much.
[83:41.32]I appreciate it.

[84:19.28]It's, like, fucked up.
[84:22.59]Yeah.
[84:23.29]Alright, let's get going.
[84:24.82]Thank you, everybody.
[84:26.06]So, I'm going to go into... How many of you guys own this fucking game?
[84:29.63]I don't even know.
[84:34.30]There we go.
[84:35.74]I'm going to go into one that has, like... Okay, let's do, like, no private.
[84:41.76]No full servers.
[84:45.32]Let's see.
[84:45.78]Players, 22 out of 20.
[84:48.50]That's high ping.
[84:51.67]Free roam.
[84:52.29]This is... Chill and kill?
[84:55.43]Chill and kill.
[84:56.01]I guess we're going in here, maybe?
[84:57.17]What about... Chill and kill.
[85:01.11]What does chill and kill mean?
[85:03.76]Am I missing something here?
[85:04.92]What does that mean?
[85:07.92]Going to a no-kill roleplay server?
[85:10.18]Guys, no.
[85:11.20]I'm not bringing a bunch of people in there to fuck up somebody's server.
[85:15.92]Alright, let's just do chill and kill.
[85:17.94]I don't even know what that means, but we're going to join it.
[85:26.18]I guess that means we can just hang out.
[85:29.11]So free roam.
[85:31.27]I definitely want to be on the dinosaurs.
[85:33.22]That's very important.
[85:33.90]And I want to be the T-Rex.
[85:36.80]Okay.
[85:40.34]Welcome to the server.
[85:41.10]Alright, so this is chill and kill.
[85:43.70]Do you ever like eat stuff?
[85:47.34]This is like sprint.
[85:49.90]Are we like friends?
[85:54.11]I'm assuming we have to get the person with the shotgun.
[85:58.75]Can I get in here?
[86:00.53]This person's locked in here.
[86:02.05]Where do you think you're gonna go?
[86:05.57]Can I eventually just bite her?
[86:08.47]Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[86:15.31]Wait a second.
[86:16.21]Wait, that person can fit in there.
[86:18.11]How come I can't fit in there?
[86:24.14]How do you do, like, moves?
[86:26.68]Okay, that person got fucking destroyed.
[86:30.30]Wait, let me look at the controls for a second.
[86:33.58]Controls.
[86:35.56]Uh, jump, spacebar, crouch, see sprint, reload, primary fire, alt fire, roar, 1, 2, E. Okay, so what does this do?
[86:47.59]Alright, cool.
[86:51.96]I gotta, like, clip through this.
[86:54.30]Somebody's like a rhinoceros.
[86:55.48]Okay, here we go.
[86:58.44]I feel bad that there's only one human.
[87:01.54]Like, this person stands no chance.
[87:04.78]What the hell is this person?
[87:05.64]Oh, there's two humans now.
[87:08.77]I'll get in there eventually, don't worry.
[87:16.37]So, let me ask you this.
[87:18.29]How in the name of God are the humans supposed to do anything?
[87:21.01]This guy has two pistols.
[87:23.67]I'm going this way.
[87:27.57]I guess the roar, I'm not sure what the roar does.
[87:29.71]I'm going over here.
[87:35.25]Can I fight the other dinosaurs?
[87:42.07]You can be a pterodactyl, too.
[87:43.23]Holy shit, that's cool.
[87:44.19]Alright, how do I, like, change class?
[87:47.77]Because I want to... Okay, change class.
[87:49.45]I want to be, like, one of the little guys now.
[87:51.93]One of the ptero... One of the Trumpupetidons.
[87:56.37]I don't think I can be one.
[87:57.32]Here we go.
[88:01.16]Did I die?
[88:02.10]Okay, apparently I'm dead.
[88:06.06]There we go.
[88:06.68]This is what I wanted.
[88:09.04]This is perfect.
[88:09.96]Oh god, this is... Okay, this is cool.
[88:15.86]I'm gonna make my way over here.
[88:23.40]Uh... How many people are there?
[88:27.02]How many?
[88:28.04]Five on four.
[88:29.64]That's not fair.
[88:31.33]There we go.
[88:31.57]There we go.
[88:31.85]Human.
[88:32.11]A human.
[88:32.41]A human.
[88:32.65]A human.
[88:32.85]A human.
[88:33.01]A human.
[88:33.19]A human.
[88:33.37]A human.
[88:33.61]A human.
[88:33.95]A human.
[88:35.33]Got him!
[88:37.13]Rip his neck out.
[88:38.87]What's wrong with me?
[88:40.43]What the fuck is this pterodactyl doing?
[88:42.93]Why did you...
[88:44.77]Quick, get the fucking monopoly guy!
[88:46.27]Shit!
[88:48.17]Why did that pterodactyl just like... Come on, man!
[88:50.74]You're supposed to help me!
[88:55.66]The pterodactyl guy just landed on me and died.
[88:57.50]I like to think this is fun.
[89:03.78]That guy's gonna flamethrower, that's fucking awesome.
[89:08.06]I'm a velociraptor, you have to stalk your prey.
[89:18.12]Alright, didn't do a good job stalking, my prey.
[89:22.62]What else can you be?
[89:26.10]Who wants to be this thing?
[89:27.00]Alright, what about you?
[89:30.58]What do you have for special moves?
[89:33.78]Alright, you make a loud noise.
[89:34.64]What about this?
[89:35.90]Oh, this is a spitter.
[89:36.63]Okay, that's cool.
[89:38.91]I like this.
[89:43.65]He was stalking you.
[89:44.57]Don't worry.
[89:47.92]I wonder what's harder, to be a human or to be a dinosaur.
[89:50.12]This person just keeps running by the screen with their head down.
[89:53.32]Alright, can I get to the supplies or no?
[90:04.87]The screech movement?
[90:05.57]What do those even do?
[90:06.27]I probably should have done the tutorial.
[90:07.49]Alright, we're going for a long way.
[90:08.91]This T-Rex is on fire.
[90:11.55]I feel bad for him.
[90:13.63]Here we go.
[90:19.99]Alright, dead.
[90:20.55]Got him.
[90:21.55]How do I not burn to death?
[90:24.90]Corpses are ha- Find one to heal.
[90:26.08]Wait, wait, wait.
[90:26.40]What do you mean find one to heal?
[90:27.18]How do I eat?
[90:27.76]How do I eat him?
[90:29.60]How do you eat?
[90:30.42]Did you just eat that whole thing?
[90:32.28]That wasn't fair, dude.
[90:32.98]Come on.
[90:35.84]Left for Jurassic Park?
[90:36.98]Yeah, it really is.
[90:37.68]I have, like, such a little health.
[90:47.17]So wait, so that guy that I can't eat as this dinosaur.
[90:52.21]Okay.
[90:54.15]Shit.
[90:58.19]Let me scream and die.
[90:59.27]Alright, let's try one of the other dinosaurs.
[91:05.87]That guy's so like lame looking.
[91:10.49]Alright, how fun is this going to be?
[91:11.93]What do you think?
[91:15.33]Alright, the consensus?
[91:16.15]Pretty fun.
[91:20.20]Kinda slow though.
[91:24.51]I just gotta like walk out of the ground.
[91:26.89]This is just a butterfly.
[91:28.05]This isn't even a dinosaur.
[91:34.64]Here we go.
[91:38.72]Did I get somebody?
[91:42.27]Kind of.
[91:43.27]Sort of.
[91:49.63]Ate him.
[91:51.39]How do I like rescue my friend?
[91:55.71]I actually like this class.
[91:56.89]What does right click do?
[91:59.19]Is it like a dive bomb?
[92:03.20]I think it's like a dive bomb.
[92:08.44]Actually kind of weird to control.
[92:10.32]Oh no, I'm dead.
[92:11.36]Yeah, I'm dead.
[92:12.52]I want to be a human.
[92:15.29]Change team.
[92:16.73]Let's be a human.
[92:18.13]Let's try it out.
[92:18.73]I'm gonna see what I like.
[92:19.67]We're gonna be sniper rifle lady.
[92:29.44]Man, this is actually... Is there anything like bullet drop?
[92:38.57]It's actually... I think it's funner to be a person.
[92:40.83]Because it's scarier.
[92:45.48]What happened to clip?
[92:46.08]I don't know.
[92:59.05]Funner.
[93:00.71]It is funner.
[93:03.71]And then we have to go into it.
[93:10.96]Shit, I like... He's going so fast!
[93:14.10]Why does he have a chainsaw on his head?
[93:16.84]Did you hear that?
[93:18.31]I don't have this thing unlocked.
[93:19.87]That's like a parrot.
[93:20.53]I don't have the parrot dinosaur.
[93:21.77]What the fuck is that shit?
[93:32.39]When does the round... What is even the objective?
[93:34.37]Why are they all pterodactyls?
[93:49.72]It's fucking so stupid.
[93:56.91]Why are they all doing this?
[94:03.09]Fucking parrot DLC.
[94:07.77]Oh yeah, I forgot it's chill and kill.
[94:09.31]There's no objective.
[94:10.59]Oh god.
[94:11.23]Yeah, this is chill and kill.
[94:18.39]There is no objective on chill and kill.
[94:20.13]It's just chill and kill.
[94:24.57]This poor T-Rex has no chance.
[94:27.27]Oh, watch out for the saw blade dinosaur.
[94:29.47]They're really dangerous this time of year.
[94:30.87]Come on, jump.
[94:34.85]Jump.
[94:39.89]Shit, he's so hard to hit.
[94:42.21]I feel so bad for the territory.
[94:47.33]Alright, let's try somebody else.
[94:48.75]Switch class.
[94:49.93]Uh... Does this guy just have like a default gun?
[94:53.67]Oh, this is the pistol guy.
[94:55.53]That's the net.
[94:57.47]Cool.
[94:59.61]Did you just throw a med kit?
[95:01.59]Did I throw a med kit at him?
[95:04.51]Oh, okay.
[95:07.33]That's a mine?
[95:08.61]I think that's a mine.
[95:10.51]Well... Oh, shit.
[95:13.47]I'm so sorry.
[95:14.97]Oh, no, it's armed.
[95:15.57]Okay.
[95:19.54]There you go.
[95:24.50]If you set something, knife it to insta-kill it.
[95:26.34]That's cool.
[95:26.80]Alright, we might have to switch servers here so we can... Hold on a minute.
[95:30.37]Watch this one.
[95:32.77]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[95:33.37]Sawblade.
[95:33.95]I hear the saw.
[95:34.53]I hear the lawnmower.
[95:37.19]Where is he?
[95:37.43]Where's the lawnmower?
[95:39.98]Check this one out.
[95:41.10]Boink.
[95:41.62]What?
[95:48.11]This is just fucking ridiculous, man.
[95:54.78]Do you have to unlock these dinosaurs?
[95:56.30]I didn't have access to this guy.
[95:57.56]Maybe I'm gonna just play all the classes and then we're gonna switch to a new server.
[96:07.59]Maybe we should play on, like, Dinos don't kill.
[96:09.89]Only dinosaurs eating and having fun.
[96:11.63]Oh shit.
[96:14.29]I don't like this guy.
[96:18.19]Uh, change class.
[96:21.31]This is the flamethrower guy.
[96:22.43]What about you?
[96:22.93]Shotgun?
[96:25.69]What else do you have?
[96:26.45]Pistol, shotgun.
[96:27.53]What's this?
[96:27.89]It's a flare.
[96:29.21]Okay, and a knife.
[96:31.78]Alright, let's go.
[96:37.16]Go to the... Go roleplay.
[96:41.06]Holy shit!
[96:42.92]Wow!
[96:45.74]Oh my god!
[96:47.73]How many times do I have to shoot him in the face?
[96:50.37]Does this guy have like a pay-to-win dinosaur?
[96:53.17]Why is this guy so unkillable?
[96:55.17]This guy's been on fire for like 40 minutes!
[96:59.13]What is he playing as?
[97:00.19]A default Spino?
[97:07.98]Go to the ro- Use the arrow keys when picking dinosaurs, okay.
[97:15.01]You have to do dinosaur roleplay.
[97:16.45]I will.
[97:18.08]I will do dinosaur roleplay, but... Jesus.
[97:22.28]Fucking parrot.
[97:28.34]He moves around so fast.
[97:30.84]You little shit.
[97:31.70]I don't even know... Hey, look, there's dinosaurs over here.
[97:36.36]Is that what I mean?
[97:37.46]Is that what I said?
[97:39.56]Got him.
[97:41.66]These guys just eat... Oh, they're eating grass.
[97:50.08]Roleplaying stream.
[97:50.90]I will go into a roleplay server.
[97:55.41]But I think I might lock that one down.
[97:57.95]I might pick that one off camera.
[98:02.43]Because the last thing I need is somebody to come in that server and just start dropping bombs or something.
[98:09.72]And then get us all in trouble.
[98:11.70]We'll all get banned.
[98:18.99]I'm getting some kills.
[98:19.67]I like the shotgun guy.
[98:23.74]Shotgun guy is actually pretty fun.
[98:31.14]Holy crap.
[98:32.16]I got chargered.
[98:40.59]Here's where the experiment went wrong.
[98:42.29]These fucking butterflies.
[98:44.49]Ha.
[98:48.40]Alright, one more kill.
[98:49.30]One more kill and we're gonna switch.
[98:50.32]That guy got eaten.
[98:51.88]That guy got swallowed.
[98:52.72]Okay, there's the last kill.
[98:58.54]Wait, hold on.
[98:58.96]Make it two in a row.
[99:03.60]Those little guys are so hard to keep track of.
[99:05.24]For a second, I thought that was a dinosaur.
[99:11.38]Dinosaur over here?
[99:11.94]Where the hell did he even come from?
[99:19.33]I love how the bushes rustle around.
[99:20.61]That's so creepy.
[99:27.10]Alright.
[99:31.02]And what dinosaur am I going to roleplay as?
[99:32.46]I don't even know.

[106:20.50]That chat is wild.
[106:23.73]Puts medicine on land.
[106:25.39]It's an RP server.
[106:27.35]Let's go find these people.
[106:29.55]Here.
[106:30.19]Oh, we're supposed to be roleplaying.
[106:34.07]Dinosaurs don't attack humans in the real world.
[106:35.99]They're friends.
[106:36.97]Like every Disney movie.
[106:39.67]And they all talk, too.
[106:40.69]They all speak perfect English.
[106:43.73]Don't break my role-playing conversion.
[106:45.85]Alright, here we go.
[106:47.49]We're gonna be a... Here we go.
[106:57.40]I'm gonna be a fucking pterodactydon.
[106:59.70]Pterodactydon.

[107:04.15]Alright, let's go find these people that are playing.
[107:08.81]And we're going to be like a giant camera.
[107:15.26]Let's just observe as like a weirdo dinosaur.
[107:20.46]Alright, so there's a group of people over here hanging out.
[107:22.56]Alright.

[107:42.12]They're all swimming.
[107:45.32]Alright, here we go.
[107:49.06]Here we are.

[108:41.39]Okay.
[108:42.00]Okay.

[109:47.46]This is really uncomfortable for me.
[109:53.22]Whatever.
[109:53.66]Like, listen.
[109:55.00]If you want to come out and be a dinosaur and, like, pretend to be a fucking dinosaur, that's you.
[109:59.02]That's you.
[109:59.46]You do you.
[110:03.66]I guess me and my, like, two pterodactyl friends are going to go over here.

[110:10.81]I think I'm going to get in the Jeep.
[110:22.45]I didn't sign up for this.
[110:25.45]Can we fight?
[110:26.05]I think we can fight.
[110:29.17]Did I change my name already?
[110:58.09]This is role-playing.
[110:58.85]We're challenging the room for dominance.
[111:01.25]We're just role-playing.
[111:08.79]See, I'm the dominant.
[111:09.49]I'm the alpha.
[111:10.43]It's me.
[111:11.01]I'm the alpha male.
[111:14.29]I don't think you can get hurt in here.
[111:22.90]I don't think you can get hurt.
[111:26.96]Alright, let's keep going.
[111:29.46]This was fun.
[111:47.05]Okay.
[111:48.21]Let's go.
[111:49.29]Let's get out of this circle.
[112:03.59]OH SHIT, WHO'S UNLOADING?!
[112:04.77]Now they're gonna look for me.
[112:10.51]They're gonna be like, who the fuck was that?
[112:11.97]They're gonna go find him, and I was gone.
[112:15.43]Why do you play this alone?
[112:18.58]Alright, hold on.
[112:19.18]Let's pick a new server.
[112:20.62]I actually am interested in the game of this game.
[112:25.00]Heh heh heh, Finn.
[112:29.94]That was an experience I'll forget.
[112:31.72]That was an experience I will forget.
[112:33.99]Alright, what do we got?
[112:37.19]Dino deathmatch.
[112:38.13]Team deathmatch.
[112:39.35]Survival.
[112:42.41]Survival might be fun.
[112:45.03]There's only one survival?
[112:49.94]I guess I'm going to try it.
[112:54.96]I guess survival.
[112:55.74]Geothermal.
[112:56.12]Geothermal.
[112:58.91]This guy's like waiting for people.
[113:01.87]Oh, this might be like waves of enemies.
[113:03.69]I don't know if I want to do this.
[113:08.39]Uh... I don't know.
[113:10.05]I don't think I want to do this.
[113:12.04]Nah.
[113:13.06]I don't want to do like waves.
[113:17.78]I miss Jack Black.
[113:22.92]Oh, the servers aren't empty.
[113:28.87]Streamer causes an uproar in RP room.
[113:32.33]Dino deathmatch might be where it's at, I think.
[113:34.93]This keeps opening.
[113:37.97]Alright, let's get one that's got a shitload of players.
[113:40.42]Stop it!
[113:42.98]Players... 27 out of 30.

[113:48.98]Who's the biggest dino deathmatch?
[113:51.54]This is the only one.
[113:52.20]6 out of 20.
[113:52.73]0 out of 10.
[113:56.19]Is that the only one?
[113:58.44]I guess that's the only one.
[113:59.18]Get to the chopper.
[114:00.12]What the hell is get to the chopper?
[114:05.90]Let's just jump in this one.
[114:08.43]If you want to play.
[114:08.99]We're just going to do it.
[114:11.39]Stop it.
[114:14.49]That doesn't look correct.
[114:17.31]Alright.
[114:18.07]Dino versus dino.
[114:19.05]Here we go.
[114:20.74]Now I'm going to stay.

[114:24.94]The parrot raptor.
[114:28.14]I like this area.

[115:00.58]Turkey down.
[115:01.14]Yeah, I get to be like the turkey parrot.
[115:03.81]Alright, let's go.
[115:04.31]Although I don't really know.
[115:07.33]Like, where the hell is anybody?
[115:08.29]This map seems really large.
[115:14.97]Fred sounds like a Jerma985 name.
[115:17.14]Uh-huh.
[115:23.32]I guess it is.
[115:24.06]Can I get on the bike?
[115:26.02]Oh, that'd be perfect.
[115:30.95]So what's the... Where's the other team?
[115:41.10]What's with this game being a bad game?
[115:43.14]No bugs, I know.
[115:43.94]What the fuck?
[115:46.41]They are... Oh, they know.
[115:53.11]That looks huge.
[115:56.08]What the fuck is that gigantic dinosaur?
[115:59.81]That's crazy!
[116:01.85]I wanna be that thing.
[116:03.25]I'm gonna switch to that.
[116:06.93]Go back to Kong.
[116:11.36]Was that a guy from the stream or is that an amazing coincidence?
[116:13.54]I don't know.
[116:18.22]Damn, that guy's fucking huge.
[116:19.46]Alright, let's go out.
[116:20.04]Let's get him.
[116:23.02]Is this a... Is this like a roleplay server?
[116:30.87]Apparently that hurt.
[116:32.00]I don't know.
[116:32.34]What's going on?
[116:33.34]Why are we all surrounding this one T-Rex?
[116:35.10]And why is there a giant, like, I hacked the game dinosaur right here?
[116:44.63]Look at this mess.
[116:47.05]This just looks like a bunch of birds in, like, fucking Boston or, like, San Francisco.
[116:51.21]It doesn't even look like dinosaurs.
[116:52.45]It looks like the bird corner.
[116:56.10]Can you count the dinosaurs?
[116:57.14]Because I can't.
[116:57.70]All I see are birds.
[117:05.68]Is anybody playing the game?
[117:08.59]Fucking fight each other.
[117:09.47]What's going on here?
[117:12.49]What is this guy doing?
[117:17.95]What is going on?
[117:18.85]Why are we doing this?
[117:20.61]This is not an RP server, is it?
[117:23.78]Somebody died.
[117:24.28]There we go.
[117:26.38]There's my fucking first fight.

[118:42.59]Hey, okay, you wanna know what I think about this game and, like, this server?
[118:47.71]I like this.
[118:51.05]You guys can hold your reservations.

[118:58.36]This is cool.
[119:02.20]Right?
[119:02.62]This is a cool game.

[119:19.31]Go back to Trespasser.
[119:22.65]Alright, here we go.
[119:24.23]We're just dropping in on everybody.
[119:32.30]Alright, we're going to try one more server.
[119:35.60]I want to play the game one more time because it was actually kind of fun.
[119:39.26]I'll go back to Team Deathmatch.
[119:44.38]That's great, Jeremiah.
[119:45.74]Next.
[119:48.00]No, guys, come on.
[119:50.09]Don't be so cruel.
[119:51.07]It's like fun.
[119:51.93]This game is fun.
[119:53.31]Don't be so cruel.
[119:56.59]What about Get to the Chopper?
[119:59.75]I mean, this ping is terrible.
[120:01.91]Let's get 24 people into Get to the Chopper.
[120:04.86]I'm going in.
[120:06.80]Get to the chopper.
[120:12.22]Just fill this place and let's get to the chopper.
[120:24.49]There's actually ranked games, really?
[120:30.07]See, we're going to fill this game.
[120:32.69]Did I finish that game made by kids?
[120:33.95]No, I didn't.
[120:38.07]It's a fantastic game.
[120:39.37]No, it looks pretty cool.
[120:40.65]Wait, who's shooting me?
[120:45.98]Yeah, you think you can fucking run from the T-Rex, buddy?
[120:49.10]Nope.
[120:50.64]Oh, wow.
[120:52.46]Almost.
[120:54.64]This is very inspiring speech.
[120:56.26]Next.
[121:00.89]Aww.
[121:03.31]Try different dinos.
[121:06.31]How much is this game?
[121:10.61]This game is definitely better than Evolve.
[121:12.49]I would probably say that's absolutely true.
[121:16.61]So the humans have to get to the chopper.
[121:21.14]Or do we have to get to the chopper?
[121:22.46]Do the dinosaurs have to get to the chopper?
[121:24.24]Are these NPCs?
[121:29.48]This game's like $12.
[121:30.02]$12.
[121:30.04]I have a muzzle on.
[121:31.00]I can't do anything.
[121:45.70]Alright, alright, everybody calm down.
[121:47.24]Everybody calm down.
[121:48.32]We're going back to Trespasser.
[121:49.57]We're going to go back to Trespasser for like an hour.
[121:51.31]Everybody calm down.
[121:55.11]That game was cool.
[121:57.37]Alright, what do you want?
[121:58.11]Trespasser or Kong?
[121:59.41]I'm going to make a straw poll.
[122:02.61]Do you guys want to meet?
[122:03.59]Should I continue Trespasser or do you want me to go back to King Kong?
[122:11.29]Hold on a second.
[122:14.62]Oh, Jesus.
[122:17.45]I love, I love donuts.
[122:18.49]Just gave a hundred bucks for like the 30th time in like the last 30 days.
[122:24.64]It just has heart.
[122:25.42]It just says heart.
[122:28.62]Uh, thank you so much.
[122:29.66]I love donuts.
[122:31.20]Oh, I should call you at this point.
[122:33.56]Um, financial backer.
[122:37.92]I love donuts.
[122:39.94]Thank you for the a hundred bucks.
[122:42.38]hundred bucks from I Love Donuts everybody alright hold on let me get a straw poll as I thank my one of my like investors okay what do you want me to play for the next like hour or so some odd hour or so are we going back to Trespasser or do you want me to go back to King Kong I Love Donuts must be a doctor
[123:16.61]Excuse me?
[123:17.59]Oh, purple.
[123:18.03]I have many investors.
[123:20.57]There are many investors.
[123:27.62]Go play Turok.
[123:32.14]Spore is a dinosaur game.
[123:35.14]You know, that is kind of true, but I already played Spore.
[123:39.52]Alright, looks like Trespasser is going to win.
[123:41.82]I guess we can move forward in that game a little.
[123:48.33]Give it like another 30 seconds or so.
[123:51.21]Let's just put this on.
[123:54.65]This is so much closer than it should be.
[124:00.10]Also, somebody gave $5 on it.
[124:03.02]For some reason, Streamlabs is like removing names.
[124:06.86]It's moving bit donations and bit spending in like the wrong spots.
[124:13.44]It's acting sort of strange right now.
[124:14.94]But whoever gave the $5 right now just says, welcome to Germastic Park.
[124:17.84]Thank you so much.
[124:20.52]Also, thanks to Gurfield.
[124:22.12]Says, can you please narrate the chat?
[124:25.18]No.
[124:25.76]Here's the thing, guys.
[124:26.54]I don't want to, like...
[124:28.72]If people are having fun and they're in, like, a server and they, like, don't think they're getting, like, broadcasted, you know what I mean?
[124:35.25]That's, like, I don't want to do that.
[124:37.21]That's not me.
[124:38.69]I'm not going to go in there and, like, secretly fucking videotape people and be like, oh, let's, like, make fun of everything.
[124:43.37]No, that's not me.
[124:45.75]I'd rather just go in there and be a dipshit for a few minutes and then leave.
[124:50.06]But thank you, Baron Von Baby, again, for the 15.
[124:52.88]I think that's the last one.
[124:53.84]Then it gets weird.
[124:54.54]Let me see if I missed anybody down here.
[124:59.46]I don't think so alright it looks like we're going back to trespasser for the remainder of tonight's stream poor kong got to see one like shitty dinosaur alright we're going back to trespasser just give me one second while I get it ready I will be back in like two seconds

[126:40.78]My name is John Parker Hammond.
[126:43.08]Wait, what?
[126:44.14]That's what he says.
[126:46.88]Okay, that should be good.
[126:47.96]And we're back with more.
[126:51.58]We're back with more Trespasser.
[126:53.04]Shut up.
[127:01.59]Shut up, Toad Hammond.
[127:04.37]So, I believe we were right here.
[127:05.97]I gotta go in the backyard and get the keycard.
[127:11.56]The resolution's wrong?
[127:12.84]Uh, it shouldn't be.
[127:17.82]My name is Job.
[127:19.68]Oh, God, he's still talking.
[127:25.87]Okay, let me remember what's going on.
[127:27.69]So, I gotta go in the... I got this disc.
[127:29.17]I gotta go in the backyard.
[127:31.74]That's it.
[127:32.88]Okay, open the door.
[127:36.08]I forgot the fucking front door doesn't open.
[127:39.77]That's moronic.
[127:42.37]Go to the roof of the outhouse.
[127:44.07]Go to the roof of the outhouse.
[127:45.83]No.
[127:47.27]We have to get real clues here from the chat.
[127:50.19]No bullshit clues.
[127:53.39]Alright, so where is this... You guys were telling me they were in the backyard back here.
[127:57.80]Is it under a rock?
[128:02.69]What is that sticking out from?
[128:09.31]Look down?
[128:11.83]The ground looks fucking horrible.
[128:13.25]Over here, there it is.
[128:14.17]I can see it.
[128:17.63]There it is.
[128:18.21]This will open his bedroom window, right?
[128:22.73]Got it.
[128:25.01]Wait, do I have it?
[128:28.59]Now I do.
[128:32.92]I love this shit, man.
[128:34.60]I love holding it up like it's some... I love the victory hold.
[128:37.96]I've got it!
[128:38.46]Alright, now we gotta go up the stairs.
[128:47.15]And then open up his door.
[128:48.33]Open up his bedroom door.
[128:51.27]With our hotel key.
[128:53.15]Oh shit, I can't go that way.
[128:55.23]I gotta hold this back.
[128:56.29]Okay, just... The thing is, like, I can't get rid of any of these things.
[129:00.48]And I'm scared to drop them.
[129:03.73]How the hell did I get up there before?
[129:06.47]I don't even... Okay, yeah, the stupid secret door, right?
[129:10.00]I'm gonna drop this shit.
[129:12.68]I can't even... How did I get up there before?
[129:16.06]It was yesterday.
[129:17.18]It was like last night.
[129:17.94]I don't even fucking remember.
[129:18.82]There was like some entrance on this thing on the side.
[129:21.55]I have no idea.
[129:26.05]I made the amnesia joke.
[129:27.07]I remember that.
[129:28.69]Funny.
[129:28.93]What a funny fucking guy, huh?
[129:31.87]Do a full playthrough?
[129:32.80]I mean, we're probably at least, like, halfway through the game.
[129:38.40]How the fuck did I get up there?
[129:40.24]Oh, the stupid-ass boxes.
[129:43.86]I'm gonna drop this.
[129:44.62]Alright, don't drop the disc.
[129:55.29]I'm gonna drop it and I'm gonna lose all the data on it.
[130:00.04]Okay, where's his weird room?
[130:02.66]Not through there, over here?
[130:03.64]Over here, okay.
[130:05.99]Plot twist, it's still the tutorial.
[130:08.11]I know, don't scare me like that.
[130:09.19]Alright, open the door.
[130:12.49]Don't need this shit anymore.
[130:13.55]Alright, there is... There's a purple card.
[130:22.44]So I don't need this thing, throw it.
[130:24.76]I wanted to throw that.
[130:25.50]Oh, and a disc, a disc reader, a disc reader.
[130:31.66]You don't even tell me I have to put it in here.
[130:34.82]Oh, God.
[130:35.32]Not another one of these fucking things again.
[130:43.01]That's not... That ain't gonna go in there.
[130:44.77]Hold on.
[130:49.59]Imagine if somebody couldn't fucking do this.
[131:01.87]Fucking discreet.
[131:03.31]I don't think it's but it looks like it's supposed to go in there.
[131:05.57]Oh my God Somebody correct me if I'm wrong here.
[131:14.97]I think this is actually this is what it's supposed to happen No, I got to pick it up the right way So I got it's gonna spin
[131:34.29]I don't know if I'm supposed to do this.
[131:41.20]Hold on.
[131:41.50]Let me just make sure I'm not insane.
[131:43.26]Put that down.
[131:45.36]Did I play it?
[131:46.32]I think I actually just played it.
[132:04.50]I don't know.
[132:05.56]If you guys tell me that if I leave this room and everyone screams at me.
[132:08.08]Am I playing this through my hand?
[132:10.89]This is like his sex diary.
[132:11.97]This is like actually fucking creeping me out.
[132:31.23]I would stare at her when she wasn't looking.
[132:33.13]I'm just so- Wait, what the fuck is he talking about?
[132:35.69]What the fuck is he talking about?
[132:39.71]Push the red button?
[132:40.79]I mean, I kinda can't.
[132:48.95]I- This is not what I'm supposed to do.
[132:53.64]Okay, I got the purple fucking keycard.
[132:55.34]Time to leave.
[132:55.76]Let's go.
[132:56.08]Dr. Hammond, do you have a gun in your office?
[133:04.34]What is that?
[133:06.54]Buttons.
[133:07.80]A few weeks after we landed, we went to the summit to put up a crude satellite link.
[133:13.22]The main laboratory and administrative buildings.
[133:15.66]This was... Oh, that was the eagle button.
[133:17.44]That was the bird button.
[133:18.48]...where the real magic trick happened.
[133:21.70]Okay.
[133:21.82]Nah, good thing I pressed the bird button.
[133:22.74]When they come to dig up our secrets... What is this?
[133:25.36]...they'll come here.
[133:26.78]The pylons run for kilometers, one every hundred meters or so.
[133:30.50]It's a fucking dumb phone.
[133:32.16]I built them to last.
[133:34.29]There we go.
[133:35.19]Cool.
[133:35.31]Mountaintop station.
[133:36.77]Last chance.
[133:37.27]Now I know where to go.
[133:46.14]Go.
[133:46.70]Alright, I got it.
[133:47.68]Do I still have the fucking... Where did it go?
[133:49.44]How annoying.
[133:50.83]This thing is the hardest thing in the game to hold.
[133:55.25]I dropped it again, didn't I?
[133:56.63]No, thank God.
[134:14.14]What is going on?
[134:15.12]I can't get away from her boobs.
[134:20.33]Do I need to carry this shit around?
[134:21.87]We're leaving.
[134:26.17]Time to open the purple door.
[134:27.21]Here we go.
[134:32.27]Walk the walk.
[134:39.50]Just wedge it.
[134:41.50]I can't!
[134:43.36]It was like, I couldn't, it was just stuck there.
[134:46.28]I can't put the card in my pocket.
[134:47.37]If you put something in your pocket in this game, you have to take out the other thing in your pocket.
[134:51.33]You only have one pocket.
[134:55.59]Don't.
[134:56.45]Please just move, door.
[134:59.57]Fucking Steven Spielberg.
[135:00.87]Like, I'll say it before and I'll say it again.
[135:03.61]When was his last good movie?
[135:04.97]Up?
[135:05.45]Yeah.
[135:05.89]That was like fucking 20 years ago.
[135:10.68]Oh, yeah.
[135:10.94]Great, great, like, movie.
[135:12.02]Up.
[135:13.32]Spielberg.
[135:13.88]Fucking, like, wrote it.
[135:17.36]Alright, where's the purple door?
[135:18.30]Hello?
[135:19.72]Hello?
[135:19.98]Why am I saying hello?
[135:23.43]Thank you very much.
[135:24.53]Why am I saying hello?
[135:31.97]Is there gonna be another person?
[135:34.01]Maybe?
[135:34.25]Up.
[135:39.83]Up.
[135:42.55]Still looking for the phone.
[135:46.94]Here she goes again.
[135:50.88]Where's that phone?
[135:51.62]I want my cartoons and juice boxes.
[135:53.54]Alright, for a guy that made... For a guy that made Independence Day, this sure is like a slow-ass game at this point.
[136:11.35]Somebody told me to come in here, that the phone is in here.
[136:17.40]Is there actually a phone in here?
[136:20.58]Or was I being lied to?
[136:25.83]Is there a phone in here?
[136:32.28]No, there's a gun in here, though.
[136:40.49]Upstairs, okay.
[136:41.35]Well, I'm gonna just drop this here because I'm gonna remember where it is and I'm not gonna have to worry about picking it up a thousand times.
[136:57.77]Where upstairs is it?
[136:59.25]Oops.
[137:02.16]This is not a phone, guys.
[137:03.26]This is not a phone.
[137:05.50]This is like a high-powered rifle.
[137:07.58]This isn't a telephone.
[137:10.38]I can't call anybody on this.
[137:14.76]What am I doing in here?
[137:15.62]Ah, that was loud as hell.
[137:22.85]Well, let's just go open up Dr. Wu's office.
[137:28.62]Lady, you can put your hand down before you... Oh my god.
[137:37.10]Whoa, that was a nice phone.
[137:39.36]Don't forget the fucking keycard.
[137:45.85]It is a phone.
[137:46.51]Hold it up against your head.
[137:50.09]This is true.
[137:54.71]Well, I kind of don't want... I can't really do anything.
[137:57.71]Except go to the purple door.
[138:04.34]I love how this was a dinosaur game, and now it turned into, like...
[138:08.29]Walk the empty ghost town streets.
[138:22.94]This is not the right way.
[138:24.18]I'm going over here.
[138:25.08]It's back here.
[138:25.58]It's like the first door.
[138:30.58]Yeah, I can't take the gun.
[138:31.70]No, come on.
[138:32.32]Not this.
[138:33.02]No, not right now.
[138:34.42]I just want to get the hell out of this.
[138:38.62]The dinosaurs got bored and left, I know.
[138:40.62]But I can hear them.
[138:41.34]There's one over there.
[138:43.66]Just keep walking straight.
[138:45.38]Who cares?
[138:59.97]Go back to King Kong?
[139:03.29]You fools picked this over Kong.
[139:04.91]No, it was a democracy.
[139:08.18]And this one.
[139:10.02]This is this one, and... And now you gotta live with it.
[139:14.24]You gotta live with the key card walk.
[139:16.54]You guys knew this is where we left off last night.
[139:20.94]See, this... This... This is not where we were going.
[139:26.00]Where the hell were we supposed to be going?
[139:29.04]What key card is the purple fucking card for?
[139:30.58]What?
[139:34.01]Uh...
[139:39.14]I already came in here?
[139:39.90]What the hell?
[139:40.42]Was there something else in here?
[139:47.82]Was there another keycard door in here?
[139:49.35]I'm fucking lost right now.
[139:54.19]Oh god.
[139:54.63]No wonder this game got a zero on GameSpot.
[140:06.17]Just leave the town?
[140:07.11]The mansion?
[140:08.19]I don't think so.

[142:44.02]But who was on the phone?
[142:44.80]I have no idea.
[142:45.24]I have no idea what's going on.
