[00:21.96]Uh, somebody said, hey, I want to talk to your manager.
[00:25.84]You're three minutes late.
[00:30.36]I am the manager.
[00:31.10]What do you got to say?
[00:40.86]Wait, the title is, oh, the first, uh, I liked my title.
[00:45.78]It was having fun farming.
[00:48.66]All right.
[00:49.56]That's all I need to say.
[00:55.15]I got the tweet out already.
[00:56.15]I was prepared.
[01:04.55]Hi, how are you?
[01:07.28]How's it going?
[01:09.62]Tonight's going to be a comfy night.
[01:11.88]And you can tell that because I've got a raspberry tea right here and it's hot.
[01:17.60]If I'm drinking hot tea...
[01:21.09]It's guaranteed to be a comfortable night.
[01:23.69]That's just the way it is.
[01:30.01]Raspberry tea?
[01:32.99]This bro's farming elves.
[01:35.55]Yeah.
[01:37.85]It's alright, though.
[01:43.21]Is it hibiscus?
[01:44.67]It's raspberry zinger.
[01:47.69]But it's the celestial brand.
[01:49.87]It's good.
[01:51.39]I think it's hibiscus, rose petals.
[01:55.89]And some other some other stuff.
[02:02.39]I like it.
[02:02.68]That's good.
[02:03.84]Doesn't need anything.
[02:04.44]You know, don't put sugar in it.
[02:05.52]Don't nothing.
[02:06.10]Don't put anything in it.
[02:07.38]It's just good.
[02:08.10]Just tastes good.
[02:11.24]Yeah, raspberry zinger.
[02:15.75]But yeah, House Flipper came out with an update.
[02:21.61]As you know, anytime House Flipper gets a major, major update, I am there day one playing it.
[02:28.72]Hour number one.
[02:32.86]This DLC released two or three weeks ago, so I've missed it by a little bit.
[02:39.02]But it's all right.
[02:42.72]We're good.
[02:46.14]Are you going to make a family guy house again?
[02:47.66]Uh.
[02:56.59]Well.
[03:00.25]Build your own farm.
[03:03.16]Fake fan.
[03:07.28]Every time I, okay, every time I restart House Flipper, I have to go through and get all the tools and get money again because I just delete everything and I just delete, I don't even like sync it with the Steam Cloud.
[03:19.42]I always say, make sure I do that.
[03:22.98]And if something goes wrong and I just have to redo everything.
[03:27.36]Yeah, the farming DLC came out.
[03:28.82]Also, not just farming.
[03:31.30]Apparently you can build your own house from scratch now.
[03:39.17]Before, that was a big... One of the only cons of House Flipper was I thought that, oh, I can't make a house and put stuff in it.
[03:51.03]Now, apparently, you can.
[03:51.99]I know, it's called House Flipper.
[03:55.67]That's not flipping houses.
[03:57.05]That's not flipping a house.
[03:59.95]But still, I guess there's some more freedom now.
[04:04.29]I don't know exactly how much.
[04:05.15]We'll find out.
[04:10.36]It's just a fun time.
[04:12.00]Yeah, that's the goal.
[04:14.92]You guys ready?
[04:15.30]You guys ready to hang out?
[04:18.26]In this gigantic collective chat window?
[04:22.82]While a 37 year old moron tries to fucking build a house?
[04:28.11]All right, let's go!
[04:31.77]I gotta give myself a little bit of credit.
[04:33.61]I have like 120 IQ.
[04:34.59]My performance IQ is like zero.
[04:38.03]I'm not stupid.
[04:43.77]Anyways.
[04:48.25]He's a genius.
[04:48.93]I mean, you said that.
[04:52.11]I didn't.
[04:53.23]You said that.
[04:54.97]But... Blinking?
[04:59.46]I guess so.
[05:00.58]Thank you.
[05:00.96]Alright, let's go.
[05:13.17]Yeah, you're going to see.
[05:14.15]I know I start every single time.
[05:17.23]I just want to check the audio.
[05:19.91]This is not the color that I would want.
[05:22.42]I just was testing painting and everything again.
[05:25.20]The DLC came out three days ago.
[05:34.28]All right, so we're good.
[05:36.34]I got time.
[05:39.82]Why did you make the back rooms?
[05:42.88]I just picked the first paint that I saw.
[05:44.45]Alright, we're doing farming.
[05:51.41]This is it right here.
[05:52.97]We did this one.
[05:54.61]We did this one.
[05:55.19]I don't remember doing this one, but I think we did.
[05:56.74]I don't know how eventful this one was.
[05:59.84]Well, let's go.
[06:01.38]Farm Flipper.
[06:03.80]It's a new map.
[06:07.62]Seems kind of big.
[06:08.22]Alright, that's the one that's available.
[06:12.29]Let's do that one.
[06:15.19]Where is Molly?
[06:16.31]If you're looking for the perfect couple, visit our Joe and Lily, say the locals.
[06:22.89]Inseparable since childhood, happily married, and good ranchers, too.
[06:26.01]And yes, sirree, they're doing so good.
[06:30.62]Yet the locals don't know what this morning Joe and Lily found.
[06:34.26]Their barn damaged and their favorite cow, Molly, was gone.
[06:38.84]The couple might be able to handle one of these issues, but two at once is too much.
[06:44.81]go what do we have to go find a cow this is huge drama so what do I need to do all right let's go I can't believe it there we are
[07:12.83]Look at the barn.
[07:13.83]The roof is gone.
[07:14.73]The inside is a mess.
[07:16.85]And our Molly has vanished.
[07:18.89]I'll take care of that.
[07:19.61]It's easy.
[07:19.93]We got her from the happy ranch when she was a calf.
[07:23.62]She's the apple of my eye.
[07:25.18]The roof is gone.
[07:25.96]Joe's been trying to find her for hours now.
[07:28.76]I must join him.
[07:29.68]It may be easier to spot her from my plane.
[07:32.16]Plane?
[07:32.64]Meanwhile, sort out the barn, please.
[07:35.72]It'll be one thing less to worry about now.
[07:39.18]I got it.
[07:39.58]Don't worry.
[07:41.07]Where is Molly?
[07:44.25]That's this is just a Nancy Drew.
[07:48.29]The Nancy Drew plot.
[07:50.59]All right.
[07:54.21]They got two.
[07:54.91]Wait, there's a lot of stuff here.
[08:10.25]Could always just go on the front door.
[08:12.05]Wait, I can't go in here?
[08:13.27]Why am I not allowed in the house?
[08:21.30]Oh, should I remove the drain pipe?
[08:25.34]What are you doing over there with the drain pipe?
[08:29.13]I don't know.
[08:29.65]I just figured I would move it.
[08:33.35]It's kind of an eyesore.
[08:34.53]Oh, look, I found a cow.
[08:39.91]The game volume is a little low.
[08:41.01]I'll turn it up.
[08:45.41]Keep it as a souvenir.
[08:46.65]All right, let me go over.
[08:52.63]Hold on.
[08:56.43]Where is it?
[09:02.05]I don't think the music has to be that loud.
[09:09.69]How's this?
[09:10.25]Better?
[09:12.23]The problem with House Flipper is some sounds just explode.
[09:20.00]Just be careful.
[09:21.10]We have to test something.
[09:24.10]Some of this stuff is so loud.
[09:26.28]So I just be aware that it's the mixing on this game was one of those things that was always kind of off.
[09:32.20]I'll take out the sledgehammer.
[09:34.49]And it'll just be I'll hit a wall and an explosion happens.
[09:39.36]Oh, also, too, uh, the limited items in the Grotto Beast store are leaving tonight.
[09:49.78]Just to make sure everyone's aware of that.
[09:52.02]Tonight at 12, at, well, 11.59 p.m.
[09:55.50]Pacific tonight, the posters, the, yeah, all three posters are leaving the store.
[10:04.91]The Glow in the Dark Ghost shirt and hoodie.
[10:09.43]The glow-in-the-dark one.
[10:11.81]The original 40 shirt also is gonna be gone.
[10:18.36]Somebody just said... Somebody said, there's a store?
[10:24.74]Yeah.
[10:29.01]Yes, there is.
[10:38.35]But anyways, yes, grottobeasts.net.
[10:47.52]I feel so bad.
[10:48.40]Like, wait, what do you mean store?
[10:50.96]It's like, oh shit, you don't know.
[10:53.64]Well, it'll be there.
[10:57.16]Yeah, you can keep that there for a little bit.
[10:59.59]Okay, so let's clean.
[11:07.54]The fly noise?
[11:08.48]Yeah, it was kind of weird.
[11:13.66]This is one of my favorite parts of the game.
[11:14.80]This is going to determine how loud it is, by the way.
[11:19.59]That's not bad.
[11:20.07]Usually this is pretty loud.
[11:29.45]It is loud?
[11:31.69]Oh.
[11:32.47]Well, it didn't look that loud.
[11:36.05]Alright, we gotta clean all this up.
[11:37.85]But that's the task.
[11:49.67]Doesn't need to look full of water.
[11:54.25]Where did I get that from?
[11:57.49]Wait, you can have farm animals and stuff?
[12:06.97]What's your favorite?
[12:11.83]Vinny just used your likeness on screen.
[12:14.31]That's alright.
[12:18.86]Now, Vinny has expressed written permission.
[12:27.86]Don't worry.
[12:28.28]Oh, no, yeah, Vinny has expressed written permission to use my likeness.
[12:45.11]Play the Home Depot song.
[12:47.02]No.
[12:52.08]Some of this still looks... Is that shit?
[12:59.46]Why would I use this?
[13:00.26]Like, use as in... What do you mean use?
[13:02.58]Oh.
[13:03.62]I... Alright.
[13:04.72]What?
[13:07.45]Am I eating it?
[13:10.81]Where is it going?
[13:11.61]I probably shouldn't do that.
[13:24.81]Alright, place a fence and gate.
[13:26.09]Remove trash.
[13:29.11]Milk container.
[13:30.13]Okay.

[27:20.37]Those of you that are in this community that have not followed Squeaks... Stupid behavior.
[27:28.12]Nah, Squeaks is awesome.

[28:24.28]Yes, I did.
[28:25.68]It's classic.
[28:26.26]Pour something out as if you're pouring it onto your desk, but it goes into another container.
[28:32.47]And then you pour that container out.
[28:34.73]Oh, unbelievably classic.
[28:42.71]You left it open?
[28:43.52]Oh, shit, I did.
[28:48.96]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[28:49.68]Everybody follow.
[28:50.26]No, no, I'll lose them.
[28:54.64]I'm not ready for this, but I am ready for, like, in a couple hours to have, like, 300.
[28:57.36]Like, I'm just gonna have, like, a chicken army walk around with me.
[29:03.27]Come back in here.
[29:03.79]Okay.
[29:12.75]Stop following me.
[29:15.25]Can I give a treat?

[29:17.51]Really?
[29:17.83]What could I do?
[29:20.56]Minus one sunflower.
[29:21.88]Is that bad?
[29:26.48]Grass is kind of tall in here.
[29:27.64]You guys hungry?
[29:34.35]Okay, I gotta make sure no one's following me.
[29:44.93]I don't want them to be stuck.
[29:45.91]There were three following me.
[29:48.87]It was these three, right?
[29:49.77]Alright, we're good.
[29:52.42]That's cool.
[30:04.12]I'm gonna blame that on somebody else.
[30:17.21]They want a different window up here.
[30:18.85]Can I break this?
[30:30.90]What did I just do?
[30:33.56]This might be loud.
[30:34.46]I'm warning you.
[30:36.24]This is actually, this is probably going to be loud.
[30:37.64]We need to test and see.
[30:38.34]This is the loudest object in the whole game.
[30:39.86]Just be aware of this.
[30:40.52]Is there a ladder?
[30:50.56]Wait a minute.
[31:02.19]Use tool grappling hook?
[31:06.44]Where's a grappling hook?
[31:33.00]Flashlight, jump, crouch, run, grapple, it's in the wheel?
[31:44.46]Oh, wait, this is set, wait a minute, drone, whoa, drone!
[31:49.23]Oh my god, okay, hold on.
[31:56.23]That's pretty cool, that's new, that wasn't in the game before.
[32:11.22]I'm warning you.
[32:11.82]This is loud.
[32:13.22]I'm warning you.
[32:14.32]Please turn your volume down.
[32:15.54]We need to test see how loud it is.
[32:18.80]And I knew it.
[32:20.45]I knew it was going to be loud.
[32:29.63]Okay, I need to upgrade to more faster demolition.
[32:35.10]I don't have any of my old points, but it's alright.
[32:39.78]Okay, so we need, uh, beds.
[32:45.88]Get a couple of these.
[32:49.96]Buckets, whatever.
[33:00.65]Maybe these are dirty.
[33:18.79]How am I gonna fit three of these?
[33:28.67]Okay.
[33:45.58]Dude, get rid of the huge pile of shit.
[33:50.41]That's not just poop, isn't this?
[34:05.22]Oh, I don't know why I was thinking of that.
[34:06.66]I didn't finish my thought.
[34:07.93]There's another Squeaks bit that was really funny.
[34:10.43]For all the Squeak maniacs that are here.
[34:16.73]When he had the thing transcribing him talking.
[34:20.51]And he muted his mic and just started, like, talking shit.
[34:23.42]And he was just transcribing everything he said.
[34:25.50]That's pretty good.
[34:31.28]They're already gone.
[34:32.32]Oh, well, whatever.
[34:36.05]So why can't I place this?
[34:38.33]That doesn't want me.
[34:38.99]Do I have to break all this first?
[34:50.80]Yeah, see, it's like, oh, it needs to be bigger.
[34:55.08]How do I replace this?
[34:56.44]Sell it?
[34:56.72]I guess.
[35:05.33]Loud.
[35:06.43]Incoming.
[35:11.31]Oh, cool.
[35:11.85]That's good.
[35:15.83]Look at this.
[35:16.43]Look at how clean it is.
[35:17.75]And look at how nice it is.
[35:47.61]It's 3 a.m.
[35:48.09]and we shouldn't be mowing?
[35:49.22]All right, I did it.
[36:06.89]Oh, look at that!
[36:08.67]So much cleaner.
[36:09.37]So all the lights are on the ground.
[36:12.39]They all fell from the... Oh, I didn't do shit on the ceiling.
[36:17.87]uh whoops forgot that was the thing I had to do ah back home you've received the architect tool congratulations you've unlocked a new tool from now on you can build structures
[36:49.67]I've been playing this game for six, seven, eight years.
[36:53.79]It's been a long time coming for this.
[36:57.45]From now on, you can build structures.
[36:58.63]Use the architect tool and place the foundation on the ground, then select its borders and give it a desired shape.
[37:05.09]Okay, finally press the E key to erect the building.
[37:09.57]New tool.
[37:11.33]To plot a field, select a hoe from the tools menu.
[37:13.81]Choose a field with Q plus...
[37:17.09]That middle mouse button?
[37:18.87]And click on the ground.
[37:19.67]Alright.
[37:22.23]Okay.
[37:47.32]House building.
[37:48.50]Paint gun?
[37:50.08]What's the paint gun?
[37:53.30]What?
[37:53.66]Okay, this is... Most of these tools are new.
[37:56.02]Let's just go back here.
[38:13.53]Okay, paint gun.
[38:19.78]All right.
[38:20.98]Change size.
[38:30.61]Well, this is way faster.
[38:41.53]That's so much faster.
[38:44.75]OK, cool.
[38:46.93]What about the drone?
[38:55.81]Alright, where am I?
[38:57.01]Am I the drone?
[38:57.95]Can I fly the drone in the house?
[39:15.46]You can.
[39:15.90]Okay, that's weird.
[39:19.48]Ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-ka-bam!
[39:25.97]What happened?
[39:26.81]What the fuck?
[39:27.65]That thing's a cheap piece of shit.
[39:29.41]That thing's a piece of shit.
[39:31.85]Alright, what's the next mission?
[39:42.89]There's 89 missions to do on Happy Ranch.
[39:47.49]Huh?
[39:51.98]Wait, I can just buy one?
[39:53.40]Wait, what do you mean I can buy a cow?
[40:20.28]Why?
[40:22.59]I'm just looking out.
[40:27.21]There's a cow here.
[40:28.49]Okay.
[40:32.37]Okay, well, follow me because you should probably be in the... Oh, this is a bad idea.
[40:39.04]Can I make a bed?
[40:39.82]I need to make a cow bed.
[40:44.88]Can you fit in here?
[40:52.39]Wait, goats?
[40:54.21]Pigs, horses, sheep?
[41:04.17]They have different personalities.
[41:12.32]If I have three alpacas, four cows, and two goats, the neighborhood is going to... Oh my god.
[41:20.74]Okay, we're good.
[41:26.16]Um, okay, we need a spot for you.
[41:28.80]This is not big enough.
[41:30.46]You need a way bigger space than this.
[41:33.19]No, fuck my bed.
[41:34.37]I don't care.
[41:35.81]You need more room.
[41:37.77]No, fuck this.
[41:39.83]Loud incoming.
[41:44.07]Oh, I can't.
[41:44.61]Hold on.
[42:04.37]500 bucks?
[42:19.05]How do I... It's $3,000!
[42:20.51]I'm working on it.
[42:21.27]I'm trying.
[42:21.75]Hold on.
[42:28.57]You gotta get out of the way.
[42:29.39]No, you can't go this way.
[42:32.12]You have to wait.
[42:38.99]Oh, this is like wet concrete.
[42:40.85]Watch out.
[42:47.11]Oh, no.
[42:48.25]Oh, no.
[42:57.05]I got a new skill.
[43:01.03]Design interior walls.
[43:02.35]Yes.
[43:04.35]Okay.
[43:05.55]Building modification.
[43:09.24]Oh, that is so cute.
[43:11.14]All right, come on out.
[43:15.42]Edit inner... Select two... Press and select two points to edit inner walls.
[43:24.12]Two points?
[43:29.42]I guess that... How do I...
[43:33.95]Because I can move the edges, but how do I carve off internal... I guess.
[43:38.65]Hold on.
[43:39.86]Huh.
[43:44.86]Alright, well, we're both in here now.
[43:53.33]Click and drag?
[43:54.17]I tried that.
[43:54.55]It didn't work.
[43:58.07]I can't break it.
[44:04.92]Okay, building modification.
[44:06.40]Okay, now, so I want to do this.
[44:12.39]Oh, alright, that's... There we go.
[44:15.27]Okay, okay, I get it.
[44:19.03]This is the... This is where you can come in, and you'll have a little spot.
[44:24.39]Alright, good.
[44:25.01]Let's make a door.
[44:26.82]Okay.
[44:36.85]Alright, this is going to be... I need a door.
[44:38.94]Yeah, like a garage door.
[44:42.62]Got to be big enough.
[45:08.41]car garage.
[45:09.41]I know, but it'll... You put the cow in your garage.
[45:14.82]Dude, just wait.
[45:16.98]Rome wasn't built in a day.
[45:18.30]Okay.
[45:22.76]Took Rome at least a few months.
[45:24.18]Alright, what else do you need as an animal?
[45:35.65]Pantry?
[45:37.11]Animal products.
[45:39.67]Wait, what?
[45:41.85]Everything.
[45:42.30]Okay.
[45:42.78]What do cows eat?
[45:44.98]Hay, right?
[45:45.54]Do you like carrots?
[45:48.06]Do cows eat carrots?
[45:48.86]Okay.
[46:17.31]It is Otto.
[46:20.89]In case you get hungry, there's a carrot snack right there.
[46:24.56]Uh, this needs to be much bigger.
[46:25.50]It's gonna be way more comfortable than this.
[46:28.36]This is... Yeah, this is not... I don't know.
[46:30.18]I don't like it either.
[46:30.72]Uh-uh.
[46:55.18]Alright, that's better.
[46:56.08]Okay, E. E. I need, like, barn outdoor.
[47:11.11]Okay, walls.
[47:18.67]Wall panels, right?
[47:21.89]It needs to be, like, kind of like a barn.
[47:29.19]Do this.
[47:37.04]Do wood.
[47:40.52]Like one of these.
[47:46.72]These look okay.
[47:50.22]That'll be nice.
[47:50.70]Like red.
[48:01.07]It's going to take a lot to do this because my skill point is literally zero.
[48:08.08]Change size.
[48:17.70]Oh, I can't.
[48:22.71]You need one acre per cow.
[48:39.97]I want to open windows and stuff.
[48:58.28]No, it's not going to be a concrete room.
[49:00.28]I have to finish the inside first.
[49:05.60]You know what?
[49:05.96]I need to do my missions, first of all.
[49:07.92]I've...
[49:12.57]What?
[49:14.22]How?
[49:20.02]What?
[49:20.34]Oh my goodness.
[49:25.40]There's milk?
[49:38.87]All right.
[49:40.07]Hey, I wasn't ready.
[49:44.94]Needs.
[49:46.72]No needs right now.
[49:47.42]Alright, I need to put like hay down or something.
[50:05.85]No shot the HOA will allow this.
[50:08.33]Is this shit?
[50:12.52]There's no way.
[50:19.70]Alright.
[50:33.00]Okay, I need to- I'm gonna move you to the animal hotel.
[50:35.86]I can't take care of a cow right now.
[50:40.88]Look, I got all this shit to do.
[50:47.89]Are you going to go to a farm where you can be taken care of properly?
[50:53.23]Horses?
[51:02.88]I didn't sell.
[51:03.42]I did not sell.
[51:06.16]The cow went to the animal farm hotel thing.
[51:14.01]I think I can go back and get that cow later.
[51:16.62]Got it.
[51:16.90]Alright.
[51:46.00]Get to work and don't spare the horses.
[51:53.58]Do I have to actually get horses here?
[51:58.16]I got the axe.
[51:59.60]Getting rid of big trees requires cutting them down first.
[52:01.54]This is where the axe comes in handy.
[52:07.78]Why don't I just use the chainsaw?
[52:19.96]How does this work?
[52:27.86]Cool.
[52:28.20]Okay.
[52:44.48]Oh, shit.
[52:45.08]It's going to roll into somebody's... Whoa.
[52:47.98]There it goes.
[52:51.21]That would've been bad.
[52:57.75]Just- Okay, wait.
[53:00.65]How many do you want me to take down?
[53:04.45]Cut down tru- Oh, these.
[53:06.29]Wait.
[53:15.48]Where are- Where are the ones you want me to cut down?
[53:20.49]Oh, oops.
[53:21.01]Sorry about that.
[53:37.60]I want to try to use the axe too.
[53:38.74]How does the axe work?
[53:44.92]No, we just only use chainsaw.
[53:47.08]All right, put this down.
[53:51.53]Alright, lay foundation.
[53:52.87]So you want me to put down a foundation here.
[53:54.97]I need to build a stable.
[53:58.30]Okay.
[54:02.70]Let's go.
[54:25.39]Alright, done.
[54:33.21]Cool.
[54:33.93]So now... Oh, I'm so glad there's a guide.
[54:39.93]Alright, so now we need to make a staple.
[54:45.27]Knee horse box gate.
[54:47.71]You want the grey tile?
[54:54.47]Okay.
[55:00.90]Do this first.
[55:10.02]You should do this IRL.
[55:15.01]I would die.
[55:15.41]I just want to make sure you understand that.
[55:23.57]Like, I don't... I would probably get seriously injured.
[55:29.26]You want me to build a house?
[55:32.68]Like, build this from... Huh?
[55:42.81]Yeah.
[55:50.11]Okay, that looks good.
[55:58.33]I mean, yeah, somebody said caveman.
[55:59.77]I could make some caveman level stuff, but not like this.
[56:02.53]You need skill training and safety.
[56:06.73]Okay, so I need to get this.
[56:13.73]This interior has got to be way better than this.
[56:26.05]Three of these.
[56:38.99]Is that not counting it?
[56:40.83]Why is it only counting one?
[56:51.90]I don't think I can make it perfect.
[57:14.82]Zero out of four?
[57:16.70]Wait, why did it... What?
[57:20.20]Uh... Alright, this is not my... This is not a me problem.
[57:35.03]I can't get it perfect.
[57:39.37]Put the pillars first.
[57:42.75]Try that.
[57:55.95]Did it count?
[57:56.55]Alright, that counted.
[57:57.29]Dear Jeremy, your problem solving skills suck.
[58:15.92]This was one out of four.
[58:18.72]I picked it up and put it down in the same spot and it went to zero out of four.
[58:22.81]The instructions were incorrect.
[58:32.12]Okay, that's good.
[58:43.70]There we go.
[58:47.26]That's a dad excuse.
[58:50.22]The instructions were not correct.
[58:59.72]It's really not hard.
[59:00.72]No, it's not.
[59:01.38]I just did it.
[59:07.07]It's kind of finicky.
[59:10.77]How come it wasn't doing this to me?
[59:12.33]Okay, so the pillars definitely had to be here.
[59:14.45]Because it would not let me go in this exact spot before.
[59:18.00]Before it was like I could only place it like here.
[59:31.83]I'm missing tiles somewhere.
[59:32.81]Oh, come on.
[59:46.34]OK.
[59:51.78]So this thing is.
[59:53.20]Or here.
[59:59.05]Whoa, that was a lag spike.
[60:01.23]Wait, what does it want this?
[60:03.26]Half box wall.
[60:05.44]Wait, let me do that first.
[60:46.22]Oh, please.
[61:00.74]Change the music?
[61:01.56]This is the music in the game.
[61:06.07]And this thing goes hard.
[61:08.07]I'm keeping it on.
[61:14.45]No, we can't replace every soundtrack with Doom OST.
[61:17.83]Here we go.
[61:22.85]Okay.
[61:22.99]All right, so these are the windows.
[61:41.23]Horse mats.
[61:42.45]All right.
[61:54.11]For these right?
[62:10.95]Okay So what now?
[62:22.03]Two of these go here.
[62:23.17]No.
[62:24.47]Yeah.
[62:28.97]Smash.
[62:33.68]I'm starting to understand it.
[62:34.46]I think I can make my own farm.
[62:40.42]Looks pretty clean.
[62:52.95]Where's the door?
[62:53.53]I'll worry about that later.
[63:00.62]Look, there's a door.
[63:03.06]Oh, that's not a door.
[63:04.69]That's a giant window.
[63:05.73]Where is the door?
[63:07.35]Wait, where's the door?
[63:28.15]Okay.
[63:29.35]I need a door.
[63:32.69]Sliding gate.
[63:34.79]Hey, we're good.
[63:45.78]No.
[63:47.98]Ceiling lamp.
[63:52.20]Empty shelf with horse care equipment.
[63:54.18]I don't know.
[63:56.35]Put that right here.
[64:03.12]How many horse feeders?
[64:03.84]Four.
[64:19.52]So this looks like my high school?
[64:24.19]What?
[64:24.35]What are you talking about?
[64:36.07]Are you a horse?
[64:42.07]This looks just like my high school.
[64:44.55]All right, that looks good.
[64:56.42]I'm starting to get it.
[65:07.11]It's a Minecraft house.
[65:08.41]Somebody came into this universe with the Minecraft tools.
[65:15.95]My game got hacked by some Minecraft player.
[65:18.67]And they're just building in my game.
[65:33.86]Okay.
[65:34.76]So now...
[65:41.16]Just in case we get introduced to another gameplay mechanic.
[65:44.68]Okay.
[65:52.63]I think I'm going to buy... I got money.
[65:57.09]Let's buy the new house.
[65:59.21]Cabin in the woods.
[66:01.25]A remote getaway in the heart of the mountains.
[66:03.03]An easy sell.
[66:04.31]Just needs a little love to become the site of a joyful family gathering once again.
[66:08.42]Or anything else you'd like it to be.
[66:12.53]What the hell happened?
[66:15.12]I'm buying it.
[66:16.96]Go.
[66:18.04]Let's check it out.
[66:18.86]Is the new house in the update?
[66:19.88]Oh, monkey ass.
[66:23.00]This place is very dirty.
[66:40.24]Garden con... Oh, that's right.
[66:42.63]All right.
[66:44.23]It's time for the game to begin.
[66:45.43]What do I got for... Ooh.
[66:48.51]What do I got for space in this lot?
[66:53.63]First thing is first.
[66:59.40]Yeah, we'll change the music.
[67:01.26]Yeah, I didn't want to hear it another time.
[67:04.72]Uh... Hey, how's Doom OST sound?
[67:13.09]No, something else.
[67:14.11]Something else.
[67:22.43]Something else.
[67:28.70]Ooh, it's raining.
[67:29.48]Ooh, this is going to be so fucking relaxing.
[67:34.06]I can't wait.
[67:38.42]Stardew Valley music?
[67:41.02]That's not a bad thing to put on.
[67:46.24]Stardew OST.
[67:49.91]Yeah, it's like just it's just so just so nice.
[67:52.49]How's that good?
[68:08.59]I want to be nice and in the background.
[68:19.44]Okay.
[68:19.54]I'm going to plant my own trees, I think.
[68:30.77]Can you?
[68:31.07]All right.
[68:32.05]Well, that's fine.
[68:34.18]First, most important thing.
[68:36.30]We've got to clean this up.
[68:37.92]This, this, this, this yard's got to get grass cut.
[68:54.64]The stardew music in the background.
[68:56.64]I feel like I'm going to mess something up if I do it that way.
[69:03.06]I'm going to turn these sounds down just a little bit.
[69:27.38]Lawn mowing simulator.
[69:28.74]Oh, I just want to change the auto saving.
[69:31.00]How do I do that?
[69:34.98]Quick save.
[69:35.60]Three minutes.
[69:36.38]Yeah, like 30.
[69:39.04]15 is good.
[69:41.60]Every three minutes is a lot.
[69:47.08]Okay, here we go.
[69:51.52]Ah, this is what I'm talking about.
[69:58.70]This way we can get rid of all the weeds.
[70:03.24]I should get some upgrades for doing this.
[70:10.91]You like firehouse subs?
[70:13.29]Yeah.
[70:15.09]Firehouse is good.
[70:16.37]I've had it a few times before.
[70:18.91]Let me move this back here.
[70:20.07]Okay.
[70:33.58]Yeah, I got a big lot.
[70:35.82]It's going to take me a minute.
[70:36.58]Look at those mountains.
[70:42.70]Already looks 10 times better.
[70:43.80]Okay.
[71:01.67]It's burnt.
[71:14.05]It is burnt.
[71:15.27]Oh no.
[71:17.59]Yeah, it is burnt.
[71:18.61]Can I restart?
[71:22.57]Yeah, it's all burnt up.
[71:29.99]Will that get fixed?
[71:30.75]I think I can plant some stuff there.
[71:32.19]It's alright.
[71:33.63]I'll make that.
[71:35.83]We'll turn that into like some kind of pen or something.
[71:40.29]Yeah, we'll just replant.
[71:40.95]It's fine.
[71:49.67]Can you make a koi pond?
[71:51.59]Try.
[72:00.66]Where are the pigs?
[72:01.38]Hurry up and spawn them in.
[72:04.50]Patience.
[72:06.24]Hey, usually I'm the one without the patience.
[72:09.36]We need to prepare our pen.
[72:12.95]We can make sure that our animals are taken very good care of.
[72:22.93]Alright, that's good enough enough.
[72:24.97]I want to see the... What's the damage in the interior?
[72:34.05]Yay.
[72:41.74]Oof.
[72:50.60]Oh dear.
[72:54.27]Oh boy.
[72:54.83]Alright, we're working from top.
[73:02.94]We're working top down.
[73:04.14]Alright, looks good.
[73:21.93]What is all this?
[73:23.13]Oh no, get rid of this.
[73:35.31]Now, what if all the animals lived in the house and I lived in the barn?
[73:46.77]Like, they live in the house.
[73:54.70]That's just an 80s comedy.
[73:58.04]Yeah, that's all right.
[74:03.68]I want the pig to have an office.
[74:14.66]What's going on with this thing?
[74:17.70]Just junk.
[74:18.44]Get rid of it.
[74:20.20]Junk.
[74:22.96]Junk.
[74:28.08]Alright, this one's pretty good.
[74:33.74]It's kind of dreary in here.
[74:34.80]Alright.
[74:40.93]Whose room is this going to be?
[74:45.03]By the way, we can get... Whose room is this going to be?
[74:47.37]Should it be the pig's room?
[74:51.58]Who would want a good view like this?
[74:54.70]A goat?
[74:57.90]Alright, so this is going to be a goat room.
[75:08.58]What do you think we'll paint?
[75:11.28]Let's start from the bottom floor.
[75:16.63]Carpet.
[75:18.85]Can we put grass up here?
[75:19.81]It kind of looks like grass.
[75:38.69]Hmm.
[75:40.99]Nah.
[75:43.55]Okay, farming.
[75:44.27]Whoa!
[75:45.12]Whoa!
[75:56.18]It really is stardew.
[75:58.29]Alright, what am I growing?
[75:58.95]Right here.
[76:03.51]All right, I want to make a bunch of sunflowers.
[76:07.94]So I need to... What was it?
[76:09.36]It was a certain tool, right?
[76:13.46]Yep, here it is.
[76:20.74]Corn's going to go here.
[76:22.58]No, sunflower will go here.
[76:49.18]Make a corn maze.
[76:50.60]Alright, I'll do that in the backyard.
[76:54.54]That's a good idea.
[76:55.60]I like that.
[77:03.74]Yeah, I'll make like a tower defense pathing thing over there.
[77:10.18]You have to walk through and then go this way and then there's a huge tower defense maze.
[77:18.35]First of all, sunflower seeds.
[77:22.41]So where do I put them?
[77:24.96]Is that it?
[77:25.32]Do I have to water them too?
[77:37.42]Plants versus zombies map.
[77:40.38]Yeah, I could do two rows of sunflowers and then just... That's a good idea too.
[77:55.01]Alright, so if that's the sunflowers, then... What would go right in front of it?
[78:02.27]Pumpkins, carrots...
[78:05.85]I think this is it.
[78:07.05]We've got tomatoes, pumpkins, potatoes, corn, and carrots.
[78:16.52]Tomatoes, right?
[78:19.88]We're doing a plants versus zombies thing.
[78:21.08]This is in the game.
[78:27.52]What just happened?
[78:33.73]Did I just plant corn here?
[78:45.27]Okay, let's have it come out a little bit further.
[78:47.79]I also have to put a bunch of bad placement because when I played Plants vs. Zombies, it was terrible placement.
[78:56.65]So we're going to have like two or three pumpkins and then two or three corns.
[79:00.10]And then, yeah, we'll make sure it's accurate.
[79:14.06]What happens if you torch it all?
[79:16.08]Then it all goes away.
[79:16.66]I don't want to do that.
[79:24.58]Got one row corn, two row sunflowers.
[79:26.82]Is there anything that looks like a walnut?
[79:30.92]Probably the pumpkin I would imagine.
[79:38.22]There's a zombie in my lawn.
[79:41.93]There's a zombie.
[80:04.86]Walnut.
[80:07.68]Walnut down here.
[80:08.34]And then we'll put a couple more
[80:18.15]We'll do a couple more corns, like just kind of scattered, like in a row, like right here.
[80:21.43]Okay.
[80:33.66]We'll see how that turns out.
[80:34.54]Okay.
[80:47.67]I just want to see what it did.
[80:48.58]Alright, we're thinking way too... Hold on, I need to water this stuff.
[81:17.37]maybe you don't yeah it's a hey it's a process we didn't get right to the best buy we didn't get right to the mall a few years ago the process is we get we did we will we we we
[81:51.12]I want all new stuff.
[81:55.39]Now, you bet your ass there's gonna be a, like, 4x4, 4x5, or whatever, square footed, square pool.
[82:14.28]I want a square pool!
[82:15.77]And I don't know, is it 5x5?
[82:16.35]Is it 8x8?
[82:16.63]What, how big is it?
[82:25.44]Wait, getting ahead of myself.
[82:41.15]4x5 is fine for you.
[82:45.31]Permanently ban that person for an hour.
[82:47.90]And then reduce their sentence by 55 minutes.
[82:51.80]And then leave them a stern message.
[82:56.62]Alright, let's start.
[82:57.78]We're doing one room at a time, and let me tell you, I don't like that at all.
[83:02.30]I don't like that at all.
[83:04.52]And I don't like that light.
[83:07.10]So if this was, if I'm coming up the stairs here, I would probably say this is a, this could be like an office or something.
[83:16.29]Or it could be a bedroom.
[83:23.67]Floor is important.
[83:24.69]What do I want on the floor up here?
[83:29.68]They're of beehives.
[83:52.91]Do I have to do anything with them?
[83:55.01]Is there any like special interactions?
[83:57.83]This might just be aesthetic.
[83:59.81]I don't think it actually does anything.
[84:01.09]Okay, one thing at a time.
[84:20.22]Let's go to floors.
[84:26.00]We'll just do wood.
[84:27.00]Doesn't matter.
[84:33.78]I don't like wood floors, though.
[84:36.01]I really don't.
[84:40.19]Too much to upkeep.
[84:42.05]You can fuck them up.
[84:43.01]You can scratch them up.
[84:43.67]I don't like it.
[84:57.48]Green tiles are fine.
[84:58.50]Hmm.
[85:03.16]I don't mind this.
[85:03.96]What does this look like?
[85:12.83]Hmm.
[85:15.01]It's not a farmhouse without wood.
[85:17.55]That's true.
[85:29.25]I need some light in here.
[85:32.19]Something really basic.
[85:38.23]Eater.
[85:38.49]There it is.
[85:42.71]No, there it is.
[85:45.27]That's the exact one that I want.
[85:51.81]Yeah, that is exactly the one.
[85:54.97]And I want this shit to be teal.
[86:01.52]Yep.
[86:04.02]There it is.
[86:04.48]Oh my goodness.
[86:11.37]Yes.
[86:17.21]Where can I put this?
[86:17.97]I don't care if my whole house looks like this.
[86:25.12]As long as I got my square pool.
[86:27.66]That's all I care about.
[86:32.23]Does it have to be in the yard?
[86:33.11]I think it has to be outside.
[86:42.08]Not enough room.
[86:48.67]It's not enough room.
[87:00.90]Yeah, it said.
[87:01.72]How come I can't put it in there?
[87:06.77]There's plenty of room.
[87:08.19]Look at all the room right here.
[87:12.81]How come I can't place it?
[87:15.13]It doesn't have to go up against a wall.
[87:19.78]There's plenty of space here.
[87:24.20]Because it's on the second floor.
[87:26.02]So, wait, I can't have a second floor square pool?
[87:30.61]Bullshit.
[87:31.11]Now let's pick all this up.
[87:56.10]I might just put it in the kitchen.
[87:57.18]Wait a minute, this is not even my house.
[88:04.81]We're doing the switch.
[88:07.09]We're switching around here.
[88:07.96]The animals are going to live in here.
[88:08.84]We just got to clear everything first.
[88:30.23]Get a good look at exactly how the whole thing is set up.
[88:46.06]Okay.
[88:52.61]Clean up.
[88:59.23]I do work at a hotel, and the pool is on the 10th floor.
[89:04.91]Yeah, that's also a hotel, though.
[89:09.59]Alright.
[89:10.37]Now...
[89:12.18]Just clean up first.
[89:14.36]I keep getting distracted and that's going to stop.
[89:17.41]Just clean up.
[89:27.15]I can't wait to see the before and after after this one.
[89:28.72]It's going to be so awesome.
[89:41.14]Open.
[89:43.54]What's in there?
[89:43.98]This place is kinda like, gross.
[89:55.83]Alright, air it out a little.
[90:06.90]I want some more cleaning points.
[90:09.88]This map is kind of low on the list here.
[90:13.88]Where's this dirt?
[90:28.79]See the mini-map?
[90:30.79]Oh, right there.
[90:33.11]Clean.
[90:34.98]On to the next room.
[90:42.13]Beetle update?
[90:43.17]I have not gotten them yet.
[90:47.97]I do want to get them.
[90:52.16]That's probably a summer thing.
[90:53.90]I don't... I think death feigning... blue death feigning beetles, I believe that's more soon than it is the cold months.
[91:22.47]You think you'd still be the house flipper guy if you weren't me?
[91:25.39]Well, I don't know.
[91:28.49]I wouldn't be me.
[91:29.95]So I don't know.
[91:32.24]Probably not.
[91:45.12]Have you seen the new Zelda trailer?
[91:47.04]No, I'm not allowed to see the new Zelda trailer until I finish my homework.
[91:59.39]Yeah, I need to finish Breath of the Wild.
[92:14.53]There might be spoilers in there.
[92:15.55]Alright, have we done all the interior rooms besides the hallway?
[92:33.89]On the bottom floor, at least.
[92:37.50]You are never gonna finish Breath of the Wild.
[92:40.76]How can you be so sure?
[92:41.48]I gotta pick up individual playing cards?
[92:49.77]Ugh.
[92:52.01]Crap.
[93:00.97]Take out the flame?
[93:01.49]You can't use a flamethrower.
[93:02.39]Oh, wait, you can.
[93:14.12]Well.
[93:14.36]I feel like the guy in the neighborhood that is going way too far on Halloween.
[93:33.87]No, no, you don't understand.
[93:35.21]Every window has to have demon fire come out of it.
[93:38.55]Every ten minutes.
[93:48.94]It's got to be on a 15 minute timer.
[93:55.39]Well, that was much easier.
[94:02.35]I kind of feel bad that I can... I feel like this is cheating.
[94:07.98]I'm cheating right now.
[94:11.40]This is cheating.
[94:28.90]Where is this spot?
[94:38.15]Have I not cleaned it yet?
[94:39.23]Where is it?
[94:39.61]I have no idea where this is.
[94:53.81]Apparently in here.
[94:54.45]I don't think it's outside.
[95:11.94]Where is it?
[95:22.10]It's a mug on the floor?
[95:23.22]Uh, I think that's plumbing.
[95:32.65]Yeah, that's just plumbing for the toilet.
[95:36.09]But I don't know if this is going to be the bathroom, so I don't know.
[95:41.61]Maybe it's not.
[95:42.46]Maybe it's over here.
[95:43.00]Really?
[95:51.28]Really?
[95:56.24]Upstairs?
[96:15.35]Where do you hide your weed stash?
[96:20.24]Um... Well, if you're over 21, marijuana is legal in Las Vegas.
[96:27.59]Let me hide it.
[96:42.10]Aren't you 19?
[96:42.50]Get out of here.
[97:20.37]I'm out of gas.
[97:37.69]Alright, let's start taking some walls down.
[97:43.92]Fix the fuse box.
[97:48.24]Fixed.
[97:53.16]I have points to put in.
[97:53.94]What am I doing?
[97:54.48]All right.
[97:54.88]Faster.
[97:57.62]Let's do that.
[97:58.16]More demolition.
[98:01.51]More strength.
[98:03.95]And job requirements.
[98:05.07]Sound pretty good.
[98:26.31]It's going.
[98:26.73]It's a start.
[98:40.70]Cleanup's going pretty well.
[98:46.49]There's one issue there.
[98:51.63]This is clean.
[98:52.35]This is clean.
[99:04.52]Yeah, I got the Stardew Valley soundtrack playing in the background.
[99:09.94]Make it extra comfortable.
[99:16.54]I think this is permanent.
[99:20.06]Yeah, it is.
[99:21.56]Who puked up that high on the wall?
[99:26.45]You have to stand up here and aim this way to puke up at the ceiling.
[99:42.18]We're going to get all new bathroom stuff anyways.
[99:43.78]Yeah, we're going to do that.
[99:46.99]Okay.
[100:05.79]Remove the whole bathroom?
[100:08.07]I might once everything's clean.
[100:10.45]Design does not happen until everything is clean.
[100:16.63]So all the HGTV Andes can hold on a second.
[100:32.74]There's dirt up here.
[100:49.95]Okay, this is kind of cool.
[100:55.36]Where is it?
[100:58.67]Ah, I got it.
[100:59.17]Okay, thank goodness.
[101:44.14]Okay, it's the painting frames.
[102:04.17]One more.
[102:04.77]Where is it?
[102:18.65]Yes, thank goodness.
[102:19.73]Alright, we're good.
[102:33.05]Yeah, the grappling hook was added three days ago.
[102:42.83]Changing this.
[102:47.35]I might just remove this.
[102:49.40]We'll put something else in.
[102:55.26]Yeah, I want a different staircase than that.
[103:27.83]Okay.
[103:31.85]We build our own... rooms.
[103:50.59]Hey, my birthday is 420.
[103:52.03]Can you get faded and play back rooms on Roblox?
[104:00.57]Uh... I don't think so.
[104:16.42]There we go.
[104:17.84]Much better.
[104:18.28]I might even take this wall down too.
[104:27.43]And just have a bathroom.
[104:45.62]You promise?
[104:46.52]I didn't promise a 420 stream.
[105:03.35]No, on 420, I'm going to be sitting on my own couch watching old Fraggle Rock episodes.
[105:11.63]I'm going to be very busy.
[105:18.48]I'm gonna be incredibly busy.
[105:27.97]You're gonna do that without us?
[105:29.35]Uh-oh.
[105:39.32]Alright, stairs.
[105:44.00]Oh, I want it so bad right now.
[105:50.27]Okay, we need a way to go up and down.
[105:52.47]Hmm.
[105:56.89]How are animals going to use this?
[106:00.48]They're just not.
[106:06.06]I'm pivoting.
[106:07.50]The bottom floor is where the animals live and the top floor is where I live.
[106:23.79]And it's just going to be made out of gold.
[106:37.48]Ladder.
[106:37.74]Yeah, I want there to be as much real estate as possible to put other stuff.
[106:45.05]A stairwell takes actually a very large amount of space.
[107:04.25]That's the worst possible place.
[107:05.51]Wait, where's the front door?
[107:06.27]I don't even know where the... Where's the door?
[107:08.67]How do I get out of here?
[107:10.27]How do I get out of this house?
[107:13.86]Oh, okay.
[107:14.38]Uh-uh.
[107:15.16]I don't like... No.
[107:16.18]Front door is right here.
[107:18.98]Yeah, front door is right here.
[107:40.43]There.
[107:40.69]Because the bottom floor is gonna be the barn.
[108:12.97]Yeah, the upstairs is gonna be where I live.
[108:15.73]But there's gonna be... I'm sorry, but... Dad gets to have one room down here.
[108:21.33]And I'll make... I'll section it off right now.
[108:27.02]Garage?
[108:27.96]I think that's fair.
[108:33.50]I had a dad room before, though.
[108:48.53]This needs to go over here.
[108:49.63]I'm claiming this is mine.
[109:20.05]Either this one or this one.
[109:22.71]I like this one.
[109:30.21]Get the color, right?
[109:44.02]Yeah.
[109:53.90]I have no idea how to fucking swim I probably should remove this I can stand in here I'm happy, I don't even need to play the game anymore, I'm done
[110:20.66]This room is going to be immaculate.
[110:22.62]Just wait.
[110:24.18]Check this out.
[110:26.14]I'm going to get pool lights all over here.
[110:28.06]Hmm.
[110:39.04]All right.
[110:42.52]What should I?
[110:43.28]I want like lighting, like really nice lighting.
[110:51.24]What do you think?
[110:51.62]Tile?
[110:57.28]That nice kind of clean tile look on the walls?
[111:11.41]Of course.
[111:11.89]Oh, yeah, of course.
[111:14.31]Roulette table?
[111:16.85]Okay.
[111:17.33]Oh, yeah, this is perfect.
[111:18.11]I'll put that somewhere else in a minute.
[111:25.02]Wait, I can make a casino?
[111:26.26]Alright, this is gonna be a farm and a casino at the same time.
[111:42.89]That's so stupid.
[111:43.83]Alright.
[111:45.40]Don't get distracted.
[111:49.30]So, bathroom.
[111:52.28]Yeah, like, look at this.
[112:06.99]What should it be?
[112:07.51]What should the colors be?
[112:09.73]Just like a light blue?
[112:13.73]Green?
[112:32.71]These are pretty default, but they look good.
[112:36.54]Marble.
[112:39.62]Marble sounds good.
[112:40.90]This looks kind of good.
[112:41.78]Wait a minute.
[112:42.34]Look at this.
[112:42.70]Let me just see what it looks like.
[112:55.55]That's pretty sharp.
[113:25.28]What about the floor?
[113:32.92]What's a good floor?
[113:41.97]Make the floor a... What?
[114:04.52]That's a great comment.
[114:05.86]Bro, you just made a baptism room.
[114:12.71]No.
[114:14.31]This is my personal sanctuary.
[114:29.20]It's a barn, a church, and a casino.
[114:35.77]Oh, man.
[114:40.07]I don't think... I don't think you can get permits to have a casino and a church in the same space.
[114:48.06]I don't think that's how it works.
[114:52.74]I think there'd be quite a few people that would have things to say about that.
[114:56.64]I would imagine.
[115:04.23]Baptism chamber.
[115:07.62]Everyone's saying fix the tub.
[115:09.83]Hold on.
[115:15.71]I can't.
[115:17.01]I think it's like this permanently.
[115:17.93]Unless I sell it.
[115:29.17]Well, that's definitely the walls for sure.
[115:30.69]I actually really like it.
[115:41.30]The outlet?
[115:47.14]Yeah, this is a little, this is a little fucked up, but it's all right.
[115:49.84]Everything's gonna be fine.
[116:04.50]Nice.
[116:12.01]This is a saw death trap.
[116:15.53]It's not done.
[116:16.43]If you were constructing a house and somebody walked over and saw the frame and went, hey, are you making a saw death trap?
[116:27.22]The house is not done.
[116:35.01]How are the sunflowers doing?
[116:36.05]Good question.
[116:39.79]Ooh.
[116:41.03]Pretty nicely, it seems.
[116:53.27]Pumpkins are not done.
[116:57.14]I just got a bunch of corn.
[116:59.76]Oh.
[117:02.46]I wonder, do I feed this to animals?
[117:03.62]I would imagine.
[117:05.58]Plus six corn.
[117:17.07]That's kind of cool.
[117:22.66]Handles provide 50% more produce.
[117:24.52]50% increased growth rate of crops.
[117:27.55]Which one of these is better?
[117:36.73]Probably this one.
[117:38.76]But I probably won't do it.
[117:42.96]Oh, it's done.
[117:43.30]Pumpkin?
[117:44.46]Pumpkin?
[117:52.11]Maybe animals provide more produce?
[117:56.30]Whoa!
[117:59.38]I'm harvesting all the sunflowers.
[118:06.54]I probably make animal food.
[118:08.09]Okay.
[118:23.64]Seems pretty good.
[118:24.14]Alright, back to what we were doing.
[118:31.26]It'd be so funny if you could play.
[118:42.60]We gotta get a better door than this.
[118:43.88]This thing sucks.
[118:44.60]Alright, if I'm walking in... I want mister's.
[118:54.27]I want kind of scented misters to be spraying at an angle here and here right at the door.
[119:03.15]I want to get coated by like a nice gentle mist of some kind of fragrance.
[119:14.11]Then I want to be able to sit down here and just sit.
[119:20.76]Just inhale and exhale.
[119:31.55]Let me do this.
[119:42.95]Carbon monoxide.
[119:44.19]What are you talking about?
[119:51.71]And by the way, I don't want a window in here.
[119:55.65]This is for me to come in.
[119:57.21]Sit down with some nice lights.
[120:05.17]You're gonna get CO2?
[120:06.53]I'm gonna be... What?
[120:08.65]I'll put a vent!
[120:27.67]See?
[120:36.12]So that's not enough.
[120:40.30]See, I'll be fine.
[120:41.28]I've got a vent.
[120:51.15]It's not an interrogation room.
[120:56.25]What interrogation room has marbled blue, like, pool walls?
[121:02.67]What are you talking about?
[121:05.32]I've never seen an interrogation room on any television shows or any movie that took place inside of an indoor pool facility.
[121:12.14]Alright, move this.
[121:22.89]Gotta get my towel in the right spot.
[121:32.64]See?
[121:33.28]We're safe.
[121:37.71]I don't hate that light.
[121:50.62]There.
[121:50.78]Are you happy?
[121:53.23]There.
[121:56.05]Are you happy now?
[122:06.60]No!
[122:09.82]No, I am not making the Spongebob kitchen.
[122:15.53]It might look identical right now, but I can assure you this is not the Spongebob kitchen.
[122:21.21]But now I feel like it kind of has to be.
[122:28.31]But what about my sanctuary?
[122:34.46]But what about my sanctuary?
[122:53.70]My god damn that okay fine Fine I'm making a second room where my sanctuary is going There's like two barrels with the door So the door needs to be
[123:22.21]here, right?
[123:23.49]So let's say the window is here.
[123:33.25]The door would need to be here.
[123:35.27]That's fine.
[123:36.59]Let's operate on the door being right here.
[123:51.31]The door's there, the fridge... Where's the wall?
[123:56.44]No, the door would need to be right here, but I can't do it like that.
[123:58.90]Because if this was the window... I guess that would make sense.
[124:11.61]Then I need a little table right here.
[124:23.85]It's blue, right?
[124:25.78]Almost everything in this room is blue.
[124:27.36]Does this work?
[124:29.30]It's white.
[124:43.37]Put on Spongebob music?
[125:02.86]Okay, the oven is blue.
[125:04.30]It's like a flat top.
[125:05.32]I wonder if they have them in this game.
[125:12.59]Oh.
[125:14.23]No.
[125:15.23]I can make this blue though.
[125:19.49]I think this is close enough.
[125:29.46]Is it a flat top or is it...
[125:36.51]stove right would it be like oven like grill now they have these this might do it not quite I think it's honestly this one or one of the ovens
[126:03.42]I mean it it's this it just needs to be OK.
[126:06.14]We can make it blue.
[126:06.99]This is perfect.
[126:09.49]Top is like a dark blue.
[126:15.07]How do I do the top OK?
[126:17.53]Op is like that.
[126:24.88]And then it's kind of Gray.
[126:33.10]Not that gray.
[126:36.36]I think it's good like this.
[126:47.60]So where's the fridge?
[126:49.22]Alright, now we need the hole here.
[127:03.84]It's just kind of an open square.
[127:05.44]Oh my God, they actually have it.
[127:07.94]Not enough space on the wall.
[127:30.91]Oh, it has to be exterior.
[127:33.47]Shit.
[127:44.58]They might all have to be exterior.
[127:47.68]Yep.
[127:50.74]Might be able to get away with it with something else.
[127:52.53]Hold on.
[127:52.93]I don't know, like opening or...
[128:00.07]It might be something weird walls.
[128:03.39]Now it would be.
[128:06.85]Glass walls.
[128:16.58]Damn it has to be exterior.
[128:26.40]Yeah, it's gotta be exterior.
[128:31.89]Hmm.
[128:35.88]We might be out of luck here.
[128:40.66]Half wall is okay.
[128:52.81]Just do a drive-through episode.
[128:59.31]I mean, as long as we don't touch anything, that is accurate.
[129:12.90]So I need to put a... Hold on, let me fix this.
[129:20.94]Do half walls?
[129:22.05]Yeah.
[129:30.32]Squidward would hate this.
[129:37.34]Yes he would.
[130:11.18]Uh, what kind of, it's like a, it's like a submarine door, right?
[130:15.23]Uh, I'll put on Spongebob music.
[130:25.11]That sounds fun.
[130:26.27]Spongebob OST.
[130:33.94]An hour of relaxing Spongebob music.
[130:37.32]Sounds good.
[130:47.10]Sounds perfect.
[130:47.60]Alright, the door is it's an open doorway, right?
[131:02.01]Does it close?
[131:04.13]Kind of like a big arch.
[131:30.58]I mean, if that was a little lower tech, it would be perfect.
[131:43.23]This one looks good.
[131:49.30]Turn the music up.
[131:51.84]There you go.
[132:05.25]Do the vault door.
[132:07.21]There might be something better.
[132:08.01]Hold on.
[132:14.24]That actually might be the closest thing.
[132:26.24]Yeah, whatever.
[132:28.95]Sounds good.
[132:32.53]Maybe we can stick with the blue.
[132:49.74]Squidward.
[133:02.31]So where's the fridge?
[133:02.99]I gotta fix this.
[133:24.02]Okay, I can't hear anything.
[133:49.98]My building is so slow.
[133:57.80]Your SpongeBob impression sounds like Squidward trying to do a SpongeBob impression.
[134:07.51]Thanks for the compliment.
[134:08.21]Alright, we gotta retile.
[134:12.66]The floor is already done, but it needs to be a little bit lighter wood.
[134:27.79]I like that bubble sound.
[134:34.87]It looks like this one here.
[134:36.15]Hmm, other way.
[135:02.85]Okay.
[135:08.81]Thank God he's making the crusty crab.
[135:13.16]Well, this is just one room of the house.
[135:14.54]Alright, what are the... What were the tiles...
[135:31.82]That's what they called.
[135:40.91]Where were they?
[135:41.55]Yeah, there.
[135:43.05]Beautiful.
[136:10.27]The stream is vibrant now.
[136:14.25]Yeah.
[136:16.07]I'm glad.
[136:18.39]I'm just, um... Just chillin' out.
[136:21.79]I feel pretty good.
[136:30.14]Alright.
[136:30.92]So, I need my sanctuary row.
[136:32.44]I can't even say that word.
[136:33.34]Sanctuary.
[136:33.94]Sanctuary.
[136:35.22]Sanctuary.
[136:39.21]It's kind of ugly, but I can't fix it.
[136:50.26]Alright, can I get another picture of the room?
[137:01.50]So the fridge... Okay, so there's a door.
[137:12.57]All right, so if that's where the door is, there's another door here.
[137:16.57]Are there two doors?
[137:19.83]There's a gas.
[137:20.47]There's another range right here.
[137:21.45]There's another gas stove.
[137:33.32]This one is beige.
[137:47.04]It's like beige.
[137:53.75]This is a little too bright.
[137:54.61]Alright, so there's the window.
[138:10.50]Okay, the fridge is right here.
[138:12.80]It's one of those double door fridges.
[138:20.53]And it's all blue.
[138:26.63]It's kind of like this.
[138:29.47]But two of these.
[138:30.15]Is it wider?
[138:38.17]Can't make this blue.
[138:54.89]Here we go.
[138:57.39]Kind of purple.
[138:58.75]Okay.
[139:23.11]And there's a bunch of, there's like a condiments table.
[139:27.71]It almost, it looks like a little like wardrobe, like a little bureau.
[139:42.71]Whoa, this is way better.
[139:45.89]This is a thousand times better than the fridge.
[140:15.14]OK.
[140:20.97]I need a low like one of these.
[140:23.61]This might be fine.
[140:26.45]It's probably a lower one.
[140:32.18]This is pretty good.
[140:33.74]I'd like it to be wider.
[140:54.73]Hmm.
[141:00.83]Almost there.
[141:01.37]I wish it was lower.
[141:09.98]It needed to be lower, lower, lower.
[141:13.56]I think that's fine.
[141:14.22]This works.
[141:21.48]Can't make it blue, though.
[141:33.44]There's condiments all over this.
[141:40.30]Ooh!
[141:40.76]Hmm...
[142:27.70]You can actually do a koi pond!
[142:53.46]It was a thing that was hanging on the wall.
[142:56.02]And it looks just like this image here.
[143:00.52]It was a bunch of utensils and tools, and it just looked just like this thing.
[143:07.29]I can't find it.
[143:11.85]Here it is, where... Oh, yep, here it is.
[143:18.23]Okay, cool.
[143:18.53]I mean, this doesn't match, but it looks good enough.
[143:35.27]Good enough.
[143:48.23]It's kind of coming together.
[143:49.91]What's in this corner?
[143:50.79]These are all horse tools.
[143:58.24]Yeah, but it looks fine.
[144:04.02]You need the door to Mr. Crab's office.
[144:10.24]But... I don't think it... So this is going to have to be Mr. Crab's office.
[144:20.81]No, I'm not making the whole Krusty Krab.
[144:24.18]I'm not making the entire... What about my farm church casino?
[144:34.71]I have to make the whole Krusty Krab restaurant?
[144:37.27]This took me two weeks to do that.
[144:48.08]What about my... What about my pool?
[144:51.66]All right, so let me... Okay, okay, okay.
[145:02.20]So this is to the kitchen.
[145:05.37]The other door is here.
[145:09.23]It's not, though.
[145:10.65]It's different in every episode.
[145:13.52]I feel like the doors in this room are different in every other season.
[145:16.96]All right, I'll make the whole Krusty Krab.
[145:31.42]Fine.
[145:34.26]Fine.
[145:35.24]You don't think I will?
[145:36.93]You don't think I'll make the whole entire Krusty Krab?
[145:39.33]Down to the last... Down to the last touch.
[145:44.01]Down to the last... Like, buffing out the last scratch.
[145:48.13]No, I'm not doing this.
[146:02.18]This is way too much.
[146:04.79]I'll do like 90% of it.
[146:07.75]Let me at least finish this room.
[146:11.39]That's so loud.
[146:20.50]OK.
[146:21.92]Door here.
[146:23.98]Door over here.
[146:26.84]So this stuff is actually a little bit more to the right.
[146:31.08]Is the door here?
[146:33.13]Where does this door go?
[146:42.94]So this is Mr. Krabs' office over here.
[146:51.84]Is he enough?
[147:03.63]How big is Mr. Krabs' office?
[147:18.37]It's pretty small, right?
[147:21.31]Isn't it just like a desk?
[147:24.77]There's a desk right there.
[147:25.57]It kind of is this size.
[147:38.68]Well, turn the light on.
[147:39.42]Okay.
[147:42.64]Okay.
[147:46.19]This is a load-bearing wall, so I can't get rid of it.
[147:59.56]Here's a Krusty Krab map you can look at.
[148:01.60]No, I can't play that.
[148:08.89]I'm just gonna look up Krusty Krab office.
[148:18.30]Oh, this is a good, okay, here we go.
[148:19.52]I can do this.
[148:36.98]So it really is just a big desk.
[148:39.54]It's kind of like a big, like, is it like a treasure chest?
[148:42.36]Like a suitcase?
[148:48.82]I think like a toy chest will work.
[148:57.66]A toy box.
[149:00.54]Just like a box.
[149:03.88]Huh?
[149:12.89]This dude's 40?
[149:20.21]Not yet.
[149:30.26]Trunk?
[149:32.58]No.
[149:43.79]Chest.
[149:49.18]I'm surprised I don't have one.
[149:59.51]Turn this up.
[149:59.95]SpongeBob is only for adults.
[150:06.05]I want some water.
[150:08.95]I'll come back and we'll continue.
[150:19.27]I'll be right back
[150:58.34]Thank you.
[153:26.96]See?
[153:27.64]I'm back.
[153:27.92]Is it Christmas music?
[153:38.10]Yeah, you should probably change the title to Making the Krusty... Yeah, somebody said it.
[153:40.98]Making the Krusty Krab because chat pressured me to do it.
[153:47.77]And then dash?
[153:50.01]I want out.
[153:50.61]Yeah, there's got to be like a dash.
[153:54.29]I want out.
[154:03.70]All right, let's go.
[154:17.60]Well, let me get the stuff that I know.
[154:18.84]I don't think I'll be able to find the exact thing, but a wardrobe should do it.
[154:27.33]One of the short, wide.
[154:29.61]I definitely have it.
[154:39.03]It might just have to be this big wooden box.
[154:58.76]Okay.
[155:01.16]Now, it's like a big throne, isn't it?
[155:04.94]It's a very large chair.
[155:07.09]Where is it?
[155:07.83]They definitely have a version of it.
[155:17.38]That's pretty good.
[155:37.64]Oh, and make sure you stay to the end of the stream.
[155:39.84]Because I'm going to do a full, all-in, SpongeBob SquarePants laugh.
[155:45.94]You're not going to want to miss it.
[155:47.66]Stay tuned.
[155:54.87]Yeah, that one's fine.
[156:06.87]Gold, right?
[156:18.20]Well, it's gonna have to do for now.
[156:25.20]These other two chairs are gonna have to be these.
[156:35.83]I saw them earlier.
[156:36.53]They're kind of thicker here and here.
[156:40.25]Because they're kind of hollowed out barrels.
[156:47.25]shit I wish I could just go back can I just go back I'm missing that button or something
[157:15.32]There's no window.
[157:16.16]There's another door?
[157:17.90]Where's the other door go?
[157:20.50]Alright, it's wood on the walls.
[157:32.71]We gotta get the aesthetic right.
[157:40.87]Are they horizontal or vertical lines?
[157:42.31]Looks like they're vertical.
[157:43.48]Kinda like this.
[157:57.54]Uh, what?
[158:04.58]Yeah, I like that.
[158:10.63]The lines are vertical.
[158:12.55]I'm looking at a reference image right now.
[158:17.95]Wrong way.
[158:23.11]Fake fans.
[158:26.28]Oh, this is the door that we're seeing here.
[158:30.29]Which means this has to be turned this way.
[158:32.23]Alright, I'll do that in a second.
[158:48.92]So that back wall is metal.
[159:06.31]Such a fake fan.
[159:08.33]I- No, I'm sorry guys.
[159:09.63]I don't remember the blueprints of the Krusty Krab.
[159:27.63]Literally L. What?
[159:29.19]Why?
[159:29.59]I don't know the blueprints to the Krusty Krab.
[159:37.01]Alright, now I need a metal.
[159:39.37]Like a steel.
[159:42.09]Okay.
[159:51.28]Hmm.
[159:54.10]Oh.
[159:55.23]Close.
[159:57.05]You are killing my childhood right now.
[159:58.49]It's not even close.
[160:09.41]Hmm.
[160:11.59]I've seen a few things that could work.
[160:12.93]Hmm.
[160:13.71]I'll try the one I was going to do.
[160:19.27]It's this one down here.
[160:42.87]Oh shit, it's a double.
[160:57.06]Shit, this is a double too.
[160:58.10]I don't want a double.
[161:08.07]I need to see what it looks like.
[161:09.31]This is not my final decision here.
[161:45.17]Okay.
[161:46.73]That's better, right?
[161:58.65]I think that's accurate.
[162:04.13]So this is Mr. Crab's office.
[162:05.65]We can go and mess around with this later.
[162:12.48]Very important.
[162:15.10]How... How the hell does this... How does this work?
[162:20.32]Because this comes out to the restaurant.
[162:25.89]And then Squidward's station is right here.
[162:28.85]And it's a big boat.
[162:35.09]I doubt we'll be able to do that, though.
[162:39.78]Anything that looks like a boat...
[162:45.08]Can you do a Squidward laugh?
[163:04.29]Why are there so many weapons?
[163:12.01]Wait a minute.
[163:35.77]Yeah!
[163:44.26]How am I going to make Squidward's cashier station?
[163:54.25]It's a boat.
[163:56.61]How am I gonna make a boat?
[164:00.83]It's gonna have to be some type of furniture.
[164:04.07]Wait, what about a big pet bed?
[164:05.20]That might work.
[164:09.68]Sort of boat-like.
[164:32.00]The race car bed could work.
[164:36.09]Whoa, wait a minute.
[164:41.15]This is pretty damn close.
[164:50.07]I wish I could change the color.
[164:50.97]I wish I could make it bigger.
[164:59.58]Oh, I could do a bathtub.
[165:00.76]Yeah, that's true.
[165:07.79]color is it?
[165:08.27]Okay, I need a fixture first.
[165:21.50]Alright, let me get the back wall.
[165:24.31]The back wall is kind of like a blue and green and pink and it's kind of a lot of different colors, but I don't think I can do it.
[165:32.29]So we're going to have to just do the best I can here.
[165:35.78]Just make it kind of industrial.
[165:40.84]I could paint it.
[165:41.98]Oh, there's a boat.
[165:47.70]I think the bathtub will be fine.
[165:48.66]Should we just use the ones we were using before?
[166:08.99]These kind of work.
[166:16.09]I think this is actually perfect.
[166:19.71]All right, let's spend like $100,000 on this because it's going to be almost the entire floor here.
[166:24.51]All right, before we do anything, this is all open.
[166:33.36]And there's a bunch of tables.
[166:41.34]What if I have another farm animals?
[166:44.54]Um, I got bullied into making the crusty crab.
[166:59.03]No, I wanted to make it.
[167:00.27]I'm kidding.
[167:10.39]That's the nature of House Flipper.
[167:12.83]You go in with a design and then you do something completely different and you don't even start on the thing that you wanted to do.
[167:25.40]I might get halfway through the Krusty Krab and this might turn into a different place.
[167:40.05]Alright, so this is... Hmm.
[167:51.47]Hmm.
[167:53.79]I'm thinking about pulling this whole wall forward.
[168:01.88]That might be a cross this way.
[168:19.13]Yeah, the whole thing has to come forward.
[168:20.13]Because that will give a lot more room for the other... Yeah, this place can really breathe.
[168:55.35]Can you upgrade swing speed?
[168:56.87]I can upgrade the hammer, which I'll do that now.
[169:03.26]So the hammer's better.
[169:03.98]Nah, that's much better.
[169:13.68]Did we get a plankton voice?
[169:14.70]That was a little deeper, maybe.
[169:42.55]Don't crash my stream's joke economy right now.
[169:47.03]That wasn't that bad.
[169:48.59]Why was that that bad?
[169:49.95]That was Mitch McConnell's voice?
[170:15.14]Spongebob?
[170:17.86]You're right.
[170:18.22]Yeah, that's true.
[170:29.55]Pull this forward.
[170:30.21]I don't need to get into there from here.
[170:37.52]No, I don't.
[170:39.60]I'll seal it up later.
[170:59.08]You went from 2100 to 1790 with that one.
[171:02.92]That's not fair.
[171:03.74]That's not fair.
[171:05.48]That's not fair.
[171:09.73]I want to remove this.
[171:15.61]Why can't I move this?
[171:23.30]That's weird.
[171:45.29]All right, so the door to get in is here.
[171:50.83]No, it's a where is it?
[171:51.91]It's right here.
[171:57.11]Right there.
[171:57.98]Okay.
[172:17.45]One more.
[172:18.01]That's good.
[172:26.68]Your stock just went down.
[172:29.22]That's fine.
[172:36.90]Hey, I pay out comedy dividends.
[172:53.32]That means every, every few months I read you out my draft tweets.
[172:57.83]And they're always bangers.
[173:02.00]Hmm?
[173:22.88]You find me a draft tweet that you didn't like, and I will agree or disagree with you.
[173:42.65]Is this really that big?
[173:44.49]Why is this so huge?
[173:50.15]This is massive.
[174:10.42]Am I crazy or something?
[174:12.74]Why is this still... This is still not big enough.
[174:22.21]Come on, dude.
[174:23.11]Really?
[174:47.57]Which is better, this or Papa's Freezeria?
[174:49.72]This is much better.
[174:51.72]I love Papa's Freezeria.
[174:54.56]But House Slippers is in my top 25 games of all time.
[175:10.48]Alright.
[175:13.04]Do a little bit more cleaning up.
[175:18.92]I need a wall.
[175:21.15]Damn it.
[175:22.31]What is it?
[175:22.97]What is this?
[175:23.67]What is going on here?
[175:29.60]What is this?
[175:33.08]What the hell is this?
[175:57.22]What is this weird paneling behind this?
[175:59.12]Okay.
[176:14.53]I can stay there for now.
[176:21.05]Still... Okay.
[176:22.07]That's much better.
[176:22.79]I might want to move this over a little bit.
[176:33.03]It's not quite all the way flush.
[176:35.65]Say my leg.
[176:37.41]My leg!
[176:56.33]My leg!
[176:57.13]Ow!
[176:59.81]Did I get the part?
[177:18.22]Because now I can bring this wall forward.
[177:19.96]I would love to pick this up.
[177:30.99]I can't pick it up anymore.
[177:34.29]That's a problem for like... This problem for next weekend.
[177:57.61]I want, yeah, speed for sure.
[177:59.25]Alright.
[178:07.12]I just keep making adjustments.
[178:10.42]Alright.
[178:25.88]Okay.
[178:28.20]Go like this.
[178:38.11]Much better.
[178:38.77]Okay.
[178:46.27]Let's just get this over with.
[178:50.03]The front door of the Krusty Krab...
[178:55.02]is right in, it's right here, right in the front.
[179:01.42]The whole floor is green.
[179:28.94]I'm not going to read that.
[179:30.34]You're fucking crazy.
[179:33.58]Why did you write that?
[179:38.58]Of all the things to write down into a chat room, press enter.
[179:57.58]It's just an immediate response.
[179:59.08]Immediate response.
[180:01.22]You didn't even take one second.
[180:04.29]It was like, oh, yeah.
[180:06.33]The floor of the Krusty Krab is green.
[180:09.77]I look over three seconds.
[180:10.67]You didn't even take two seconds.
[180:13.63]My shit is green sometimes.
[180:17.81]All right.
[180:20.83]Really?
[180:21.23]Okay.
[180:22.89]Not even a second.
[180:28.73]Share that with the class.
[180:31.55]Does the Krusty Krab have a bathroom?
[181:00.74]Alright, well this has to be sealed off.
[181:02.74]Because I want people to come through this, which is the front door.
[181:06.93]This is all glass, isn't it?
[181:09.11]Big glass panels.
[181:10.73]Can I get an exterior of the Krusty Krab, please?
[181:31.63]Would it be under door?
[181:33.29]Or like glass, right?
[181:44.74]Do it again.
[181:47.41]Okay.
[181:56.07]Same thing on the other side.
[181:57.03]It's two big glass doors to get in.
[182:13.33]It might have to be these side by side.
[182:47.36]Why is it so fucked up?
[183:22.21]Is there a double door?
[183:23.25]It has to be at the last double door.
[183:31.87]Oh, right here.
[183:32.63]That's much better.
[183:35.73]Oh, it's way too big, though.
[183:44.09]It's way too big.
[183:48.84]This could work.
[184:00.30]Something like this is on the other side over here.
[184:17.49]This is what's over here.
[184:37.75]oh the entire front is glass I don't think I can do that though
[185:04.49]It's a placeholder.
[185:05.11]For now.
[185:17.27]That's gotta be glass.
[185:18.05]That's gotta be glass.
[185:18.81]Okay.
[185:18.95]I'm gonna sneeze.
[185:34.21]I actually caught it this time.
[185:35.09]Okay.
[185:56.78]Now the foundation is almost here and now the work will speed up very, very much intensely.
[186:08.73]Here we go.
[186:23.58]This is a vibe tonight.
[186:24.88]I'm glad.
[186:28.26]That makes me happy.
[186:39.53]This will start to look more and more like your beloved Krusty Krab very shortly.
[186:44.99]This is a good stream to fall asleep to.
[186:55.02]Yeah, that's cool.
[186:59.04]I don't mind that.
[187:16.89]Big problem.
[187:19.27]I cannot put anything on the top or bottom here.
[187:24.99]This has to be blocked with the bathtub.
[187:27.93]This is actually a pretty major problem.
[187:38.24]Can I do the half wall on the ground?
[187:45.80]I don't know if I can do a half wall on the ground.
[187:49.70]I cannot.
[188:00.83]A window theoretically is a great idea, but I don't know if there are very many windows that can be interior windows.
[188:15.76]I need a fixture though.
[188:29.20]Mountable bathtub.
[188:30.18]Where's the actual bathtub?
[188:37.25]This one here, right?
[188:44.93]I need the actual thing.
[188:46.27]Where do you buy those?
[188:51.39]Baths and showers.
[188:54.01]Where is it?
[188:58.14]It's the little thing that has to go into the wall.
[189:07.78]Call something else.
[189:20.54]installations instead of this.
[189:26.70]Okay, here we go, yeah.
[189:31.62]Shower.
[189:32.04]Alright, bathtub.
[189:36.12]But it's on the wall.
[189:37.06]I need a wall.
[189:41.69]This could hide it.
[189:51.60]I wonder how well this hides it.
[189:57.54]Find out.
[190:14.71]I think this might hide it.
[190:15.53]Yeah, this one will hide it much better.
[190:33.42]I wonder what the biggest one is.
[190:34.38]Uh.
[190:46.51]Installation.
[190:48.25]Oh.
[190:48.95]Where's just like bathtub?
[190:50.93]Bathroom.
[190:51.27]Okay.
[190:51.45]Mixtures.
[190:53.61]Oh, I wish they would.
[190:54.41]I wish I could see how big they were without having to buy it first.
[191:16.31]That's pretty good.
[191:17.56]I don't know if I'm gonna do better than that.
[191:31.09]Maybe I could.
[191:31.77]I doubt it though.
[192:01.84]Wait a minute.
[192:03.52]Guys.
[192:07.58]Guys, I could have just made my own fucking building.
[192:16.27]Why have I decided to turn this residential house into the Krusty Krab?
[192:22.59]I could have just made the Krusty Krab from scratch.
[192:27.25]Well, now it's too late.
[192:30.20]But are there any empty lots?
[192:31.80]I didn't see an empty lot.
[192:48.33]I'm going to see this through.
[192:49.69]I think this is going to be good.
[192:52.73]Trust in this process I have here.
[192:59.65]trust in this process.
[193:00.99]This is broken.
[193:34.87]Portal 3?
[193:38.14]Hold on.
[193:41.70]Just wait till the tables get in here.
[193:46.06]Wait till the floor is done.
[193:47.19]Wait till the decorations are up.
[194:05.48]How long has this been playing for?
[194:08.99]I thought this was still Spongebob.
[194:28.46]Leave this on.
[194:29.27]This was pretty good.
[194:30.61]This is nice.
[194:32.81]We're making progress.
[195:03.09]There we go.
[195:26.07]When the floor is installed, you're all going to be going, oh my goodness.
[195:36.16]That's the Krusty Krab.
[195:41.74]Now that's the Krusty Krab I know.
[196:04.61]Me doing that accent is like cilantro for a lot of you.
[196:11.29]You either really liked what I just did or you hated it so much that you just want me to turn my stream off.
[196:20.18]All right floor going in It is a green
[196:48.37]kelp floor this looks pretty good let's try it I need lights in here
[197:27.65]It's a green wood.
[197:29.35]I don't know if I can do that.
[197:37.85]Green wood.
[197:42.36]I don't think so.
[197:44.18]This is close.
[197:45.00]Tile though.
[197:55.79]Try it.
[197:59.21]Better.
[197:59.41]I think that's better.
[198:01.85]It's got some more texture on it.
[198:13.78]Can you change the color of the wood?
[198:14.80]You can, but you can only really change it to other wood likes.
[198:23.18]You can't make it like purple or green or...
[198:46.25]So, does this door go anywhere in the Krusty Krab?
[198:52.16]No, this is the Krusty Krab right here.
[198:54.74]I'm making my sanctuary.
[199:00.22]No, that's my room.
[199:05.52]Alright, where are the lights in the Krusty Krab?
[199:07.36]Do they hang from the ceiling?
[199:19.35]Alright, we'll have a Krusty Krab restaurant floor.
[199:34.81]Yeah, this is as close as it's going to be, though.
[199:36.81]And what do we got for lights?
[199:40.82]It kind of looks like... I can't really tell.
[199:54.85]This glass back here, though.
[199:57.29]I was going to have ceiling lights.
[200:08.19]These are kind of interesting.
[200:22.12]Nice untextured source map.
[200:29.95]It looks fine.
[200:30.69]Where should I even put these?
[200:40.35]There are no lights in the Krusty Krab, guys.
[200:44.83]There are no lights.
[200:51.03]Ugh.
[201:03.94]It's a jump map.
[201:11.42]It's not done.
[201:13.66]Yeah, it does look like a dev room, doesn't it?
[201:15.40]Because I'm currently developing it right now.
[201:37.37]It's not done.
[201:41.92]I'll do that later.
[201:55.97]Aren't the walls wood in the dining area?
[202:08.38]I don't know.
[202:11.16]No, the glass.
[202:12.37]There's wooden trim down here.
[202:17.11]This is all this metal.
[202:19.99]And then it's glass.
[202:22.19]Glass.
[202:27.82]So this is a bunch of glass, glass, glass.
[202:30.76]Glass and wood.
[202:36.30]Okay.
[202:36.54]Okay.
[202:45.29]Why are these lights so high up?
[202:50.91]Okay.
[202:51.33]I need to do... Fix this wood here.
[202:53.41]Ground.
[203:00.79]This one, I believe, right here.
[203:02.13]It is.
[203:19.42]Who's casting a shadow over here?
[203:20.54]Uh.
[203:22.66]This is supposed to be Mr. Krabs office.
[203:51.86]Does Mr. Krabs have the green on his floor too?
[204:17.43]I'm sorry.
[204:20.77]This looks like... You know those game makers that are on, you know, you can just get it like, oh, download this game making studio.
[204:34.39]This is, you just downloaded a game maker studio.
[204:38.18]But you just opened up Unity for the first time.
[204:41.56]And this is what you came up with for the first, and you have no experience at all.
[204:44.46]Zero.
[204:44.76]Zero.
[204:47.83]and and you're 12. just like oh look at my room that I made yeah there's chairs and there's a chair but hey you got to start somewhere and when you first make this room and you get really into it and you go wow that was actually really cool that was really fun
[205:19.86]And you end up making something like this.
[205:23.57]Which is a level up from that.
[205:26.79]And then you end up making a room like this.
[205:31.51]Which isn't done yet.
[205:40.22]L plus ratio plus your 12.
[205:45.86]I think it looks pretty good.
[205:47.68]I'm going the fucking lawn.
[206:10.71]You need to hold your applause till the end of the stream.
[206:19.53]We're going to see all the before and after pictures.
[206:26.88]Oh, nice rain.
[206:39.83]This has been a disastrous one guy.
[206:41.97]I don't think so.
[206:46.23]No, it's not done yet.
[206:48.35]I don't want you looking over my shoulder while I'm doing, you know, game development.
[206:57.56]This is not even in a technical alpha right now.
[207:02.31]This is in a unity free trial mode right now.
[207:05.33]This is not a technical alpha.
[207:21.50]So, I see tables and they look pretty cool and I know exactly where I'm putting them.
[207:30.57]They have yellow in the middle and red on the outside and they are wheels.
[207:35.11]They are boat steering wheels.
[207:39.57]That's not awful.
[207:51.96]Not awful.
[207:56.46]I could say dining table, couldn't I?
[207:57.64]This one's pretty good.
[208:07.11]Look at a picture of the Krusty.
[208:08.05]I got a picture of the Krusty Krab right here.
[208:09.51]I'm looking at it right now.
[208:23.43]Dining room, okay.
[208:25.21]Tables.
[208:31.09]This place looks nothing like the Krusty Krab, period.
[208:34.08]Fuck you.
[208:35.94]Hey!
[208:37.04]Come on, dude!
[208:37.92]I'm trying!
[208:40.34]I'm trying!
[208:44.10]Ooh, that's pretty good.
[208:57.46]They have the one kind of pole in the middle.
[208:59.82]It's on a stand.
[209:01.58]I don't think there's any of those here, though.
[209:03.80]No.
[209:09.38]They're red on the outside.
[209:15.40]Close enough.
[209:28.89]Yeah, it's close enough.
[209:30.45]And there is one here.
[209:32.59]There's one here.
[209:34.72]There's one here.
[209:37.36]There's one here.
[209:38.04]There's one here.
[209:59.05]And they sit on little barrels.
[210:05.96]Is it too big?
[210:13.86]Do they have any mini barrels?
[210:21.60]Hmm.
[210:23.76]Maybe a stool will look like it.
[210:31.75]Pretty good if I could make it beige.
[210:34.21]Pretty good right here.
[210:35.33]Here we go.
[211:01.33]They all have two or three.
[211:02.61]I can move all these later.
[211:33.58]Guys, contrary to popular belief, the finishings is what ties everything together.
[211:45.49]It's all about the decorations and the finishings.
[211:49.27]Already right now, it has already started to look more like the Krusty Krab.
[211:54.75]Just simply by adding the tables.
[211:57.83]We're going to do a bunch of stuff here to hide this.
[212:09.63]Where's Mr. Krabs door?
[212:11.59]It's coming.
[212:12.45]It's going to be over here.
[212:16.97]It's going to be right here and you don't.
[212:19.52]I'm going to show you the finishing touches in a second.
[212:33.30]Where are the bathrooms?
[212:35.73]That's a good question.
[212:42.67]The bathrooms are on the right side.
[212:46.56]So the bathrooms need to be over here.
[212:52.06]Okay, bathrooms are over here.
[213:13.49]How do I move this?
[213:20.41]I cannot take down these walls, so I'm just going to have to improvise a little.
[213:24.94]We're going to extend this a little bit further.
[213:27.76]And... The bathroom doesn't exist, I don't think.
[213:35.78]No, it's not going to work.
[213:40.66]It might work if I do this.
[213:50.81]Can I build off of the house?
[213:53.63]I don't think I can build off of the house that exists already.
[214:09.30]Can I?
[214:09.68]I can't.
[214:12.92]Wait, is that actually doing that?
[214:17.49]Wait, I can do that.
[214:18.41]All right.
[214:21.75]That's a big deal, hold on.
[214:22.69]Okay, so...
[214:49.22]If I extend this wall out, then I can make the bathrooms right here.
[214:54.94]So that wall here has to come out and match the wall over on the other side.
[215:07.57]So if I can extend this wall, that would be great.
[215:27.02]Because this is the back.
[215:28.90]Let's see.
[215:29.76]Yes!
[215:29.92]Let me get rid of all this shit here.
[216:23.22]I just needed some space.
[216:24.97]Alright.
[216:26.99]And now... Can I bring this wall out?
[216:32.28]What is this weird... What is this wacky wall right here?
[217:18.32]no I can't get rid of this exterior wall no I can't really oh oh well well this is the bathroom okay I gotta clean it put a door there
[217:46.99]I don't know if it'll work though, because this wall can't be manipulated.
[217:49.66]Okay, door.
[218:08.96]Oh, I actually can.
[218:10.36]All right, where is it?
[218:14.38]It's like right here.
[218:17.46]Hell yeah.
[218:19.06]Nice.
[218:23.08]It's a little messed up because it's alright though.
[218:28.46]Bathroom.
[218:30.84]Beautiful.
[218:31.38]Perfect.
[218:31.80]Okay.
[218:32.72]Bathroom.
[218:34.90]Get a few images.
[218:42.36]A bunch of like wooden stalls, isn't it?
[218:57.19]Okay, so it's still green Honestly the farm update will probably make this a lot easier
[219:25.42]Okay.
[219:26.88]So same green, same blue.
[219:28.46]She didn't delete it all.
[220:04.59]Somebody doing the, like, chimpanzee jumping thing.
[220:07.73]SpongeBob music!
[220:08.95]It kind of looks like you guys are dancing to this song, so I don't even see the anger in the chimpanzee.
[220:23.38]I just see... I see you guys rocking out to this music.
[220:35.41]It's lining up with the music.
[220:39.43]Okay.
[221:19.72]You just came back after two hours.
[221:20.80]What'd you miss?
[221:22.40]Um... Well, I think it was just about an hour or two ago that I decided to make this a Spongebob house.
[221:27.79]Alright.
[221:38.71]Good.
[221:39.15]Almost done.
[221:41.92]There aren't any more rooms after this, so it's all detail.
[221:59.70]Damn it, it's not enough.
[222:00.52]It's fine.
[222:01.02]Okay, so now we need the green.
[222:02.38]The green is easy.
[222:03.06]It was these ones This one looks kind of better.
[222:15.61]Oh, this is wall.
[222:16.43]God damn it.
[222:36.39]Wait a minute.
[222:39.63]These are way better.
[222:42.80]Isn't that kind of way better?
[222:43.66]Nice.
[222:44.44]That's actually perfect, yo.
[223:03.50]I don't know.
[223:04.34]You shouldn't be able to bump into stuff when you're doing this.
[223:08.50]It's going the wrong direction.
[223:37.83]Shit, it's got to go vertical.
[223:39.72]You're right.
[223:40.10]Damn it.
[223:41.15]There is a vertical one, isn't there?
[224:07.89]It's actually kind of getting there.
[224:09.19]Why do they have to be grass sticking out?
[224:38.23]All right, stalls.
[224:39.67]They are made out of wood.
[224:41.39]There are three or four toilets.
[224:43.79]They're mounted into the wall.
[224:49.57]They're the little Little Mounted Toilet.
[224:52.84]And they have a life preserver.
[225:05.60]This is pretty close, but it doesn't have the life preserver.
[225:11.57]That's close enough.
[225:12.19]We're good.
[225:14.35]Alright, so it's one, two, three.
[225:19.13]So I need three of those... things.
[225:23.92]Suspended toilet.
[225:42.64]All right, so we'll go one, two, three.
[226:14.59]Oh.
[226:42.95]Alright, now I need to make wooden stalls.
[226:49.77]Do they make them anyways?
[226:51.71]They do not.
[226:52.74]But the farming update gave us the ability to make opening kind of stall-like doors.
[227:06.67]Greenhouse wooden segment.
[227:13.64]Oh, here we go.
[227:14.40]This can't be inside.
[227:16.06]Bullshit.
[227:48.58]Can none of this be, uh, so what do I do?
[227:57.17]Try partitions.
[228:18.03]Wooden roof side segment.
[228:21.23]Where would the... I have no idea where they would put them.
[228:24.64]Like the horse stable thing.
[228:28.90]There we go.
[228:29.48]Yep.
[228:30.64]This should do it.
[229:01.34]Are you going to play House Flipper 2?
[229:04.67]Better believe it.
[229:05.27]Okay, let me make these better.
[229:08.65]I can't move these.
[229:09.53]It's okay.
[229:09.91]But they have... What is hanging?
[229:11.27]There's like a cloth or something.
[229:12.79]Hold on.
[229:36.22]So it's the wooden doors, and then it's two pieces of cloth that hang from side to side.
[229:42.97]So these technically would be the doors.
[229:46.97]Could always just add more toilets here.
[229:53.67]What's better, a house flipper or a buffalo chicken sub?
[229:55.63]Buffalo chicken sub all day.
[230:01.08]Buffalo Chicken Sub takes the place.
[230:02.82]It's like number six on my most favorite games of all time.
[230:10.61]We were talking about Diablo 2, Team Fortress 2, The Neverhood, Buffalo Chicken Sub, with blue cheese on it, obviously.
[230:21.94]And then probably Resident Evil 4 is probably up there.
[230:24.80]Vampire Survivors is probably there, too.
[230:31.41]I need more toilets.
[230:32.93]Installation.
[231:16.89]Nothing over there, that's fine.
[231:20.41]Blue cheese is so good, yeah.
[231:22.92]If I could not get weird looks, I would put blue cheese on almost every single meal.
[231:43.10]Look at how nice and colorful... Oh, look!
[231:45.36]SpongeBob!
[231:46.26]Wow!
[231:47.12]Oof.
[231:58.11]Why are you not at Coachella?
[232:01.13]I don't think I could name you one band that's currently playing at Coachella right now.
[232:05.48]I just don't think I could.
[232:10.94]Okay.
[232:15.85]I need... What do they got?
[232:22.65]Decorations?
[232:27.86]I need some nautical stuff.
[232:40.53]Hmm...
[232:47.29]Let's see.
[232:50.61]There's a hand dryer.
[232:52.07]There's a nautical.
[232:52.78]There's a barrel.
[232:53.48]Oh no, I thought I planted other stuff.
[233:09.37]The gorillas are at Coachella right now?
[233:10.85]Are you serious?
[233:11.57]Oh shit.
[233:19.05]Okay, Krusty Krab.
[233:19.95]Let's focus on one room at a time, please.
[233:27.68]I just typed in Krusty Krab Coachella.
[233:29.52]Krusty Krab restaurant floor.
[233:48.58]I mean, there's not much else in here.
[233:49.92]There's a menu that's up here.
[233:55.21]There's the door over there.
[233:57.39]Okay, there's the door to Mr. Krabs office, which let me go in there.
[234:20.44]I can't even look at this because it's such a placeholder.
[234:22.54]I can't even look at it.
[234:51.49]How about Minecraft Cherry Blossom Forest?
[234:56.22]Ooh.
[234:56.76]Alright, needs to be a little bit wider.
[235:19.13]I gotta type this door.
[235:20.03]What is this?
[235:20.81]It's called like something.
[235:22.13]It's not the C, right?
[235:22.91]I don't have to scroll down the never ending.
[235:30.37]Where is it?
[235:30.91]What the hell is it called?
[235:35.15]It's called KY.
[235:36.28]OK.
[236:02.37]Guess I can only do singles.
[236:03.89]I need a painting.
[236:26.75]Something that looks like a menu.
[236:49.50]Could be a menu.
[237:01.29]I can also import images, that's true.
[237:02.87]OK, Krusty Krab.
[237:15.74]Signs.
[237:27.73]Krusty Krab menu sign.
[237:38.14]Kind of hard to get a clean image of this.
[237:43.02]I can get the big thing that's outside.
[237:45.37]Yeah, we'll do that later.
[237:50.53]We're not done with our internals here.
[238:17.86]Ugly, ugly, ugly, ugly.
[238:19.42]We need these glass panels all over here.
[238:24.25]It kind of sits on there weird.
[239:00.57]Okay.
[239:03.13]Not bad.
[239:05.68]Not bad.
[239:12.64]I want to put another one here, but I don't think I have enough room for it.
[239:19.03]What happened to the music?
[239:25.05]Oh, I closed the window.
[239:25.85]I wish I put on...
[239:29.46]Terraria.
[239:29.96]Terraria.
[239:30.38]We've done that before.
[239:32.06]We did a little bit of Stardew Valley.
[239:39.27]Morrowind.
[239:42.01]RuneScape.
[239:47.78]Pizza Tower is a little too intense right now.
[239:56.45]Morrowind sounds pretty good.
[240:06.08]Okay, let's go to YouTube.
[240:08.22]There it is.
[240:15.75]The Elder Scrolls 3 Morrowind.
[240:24.71]I'm kidding.
[240:25.53]I know everyone's going to freak out.
[240:44.47]So this is just more of the restaurant, but this is way too big.
[240:47.97]This is the Krusty Krab.
[240:49.68]This is how big it is.
[240:50.54]There's no way that I... Alright, here's my plan.
[241:01.31]I'm getting my fucking zone that I want.
[241:05.25]I'm getting my zone.
[241:06.19]It'll be a secret entrance.
[241:32.51]I'm making my sanctuary.
[241:36.37]You can go to the Krusty Krab all you want.
[241:41.64]Me.
[241:45.42]I'll be in this room.
[242:10.60]This is the room he goes into to escape us.
[242:37.05]I'm missing...
[242:40.59]Got it.
[242:45.22]Okay.
[242:52.41]One more piece.
[243:11.42]I want my tub.
[243:24.78]Thank you.
[243:25.12]Uh, I want different trim.
[243:32.12]Yeah.
[243:47.46]Fuck yeah.
[244:01.67]We need a wall.
[244:04.53]Wall tile.
[244:06.47]Something clean.
[244:15.59]How about these?
[244:27.52]I need to see the whole thing.
[244:36.13]It's too bright.
[244:36.93]Well, we can change the lighting.
[244:41.77]A little too much going on.
[244:42.99]A little too loud.
[244:51.08]Yeah, it's a little too loud.
[245:01.41]Hmm.
[245:03.71]Oh.
[245:06.19]This might be pretty good.
[245:07.05]Oh, get put it down.
[245:23.06]Pick it up!
[245:31.69]That is smoky.
[245:32.83]I like it.
[245:34.45]Look at how smoky this is.
[246:09.21]Can't stand in the pool.
[246:18.72]Nice.
[246:22.05]Just wait till I get the ambient lighting in here.
[246:24.71]You are going to shit your pants.
[247:01.15]This one's kind of freaking me out.
[247:02.21]I don't like it.
[247:03.15]It's like too much going on.
[247:05.75]I need ambient lighting in here quick.
[247:16.16]I need really cool ambient lighting in here as soon as humanly possible.
[247:26.68]Yeah.
[247:27.72]Yeah.
[247:46.53]Dude, that's real subtle.
[247:47.98]I know.
[247:48.46]I need... Hold on.
[247:53.64]Star Wars?
[248:18.70]in here yet this feels like a fake room for a prank show oh yes come right this way Mr. Albertson come over here come to our beautiful spa it's like oh okay they're gonna someone's gonna do something someone's gonna fuck with me here the walls are gonna collapse and like a bunch of like gorillas are gonna attack me in here
[248:50.23]This is a prank room.
[248:57.07]But it's not done yet.
[248:58.57]Let me finish it.
[249:11.66]I need like pool lights.
[249:12.90]Do they have pool lights?
[249:16.58]I don't think so.
[249:26.91]Well, that's going up.
[249:28.21]That's a Krusty Krab thing.
[249:31.65]What color is this?
[249:40.81]Oh.
[249:46.50]I don't want it too bright.
[249:50.16]This seems pretty relaxing.
[250:12.62]It says they were small.
[250:26.21]Why is it so bright?
[250:33.06]What, fairy lights?
[250:34.28]Do they have them?
[250:59.94]Stop putting it away!
[251:01.26]There's no water even in there.
[251:47.33]white neons.
[252:16.89]I gotta get this brick out of here.
[252:18.17]It's pissing me off.
[252:34.45]I'm gonna buy like 5,000 of these.
[252:37.83]So I just never have to buy them again.
[252:39.21]I don't care if I store them in a fucking shed in the backyard.
[253:00.47]Jesus.
[253:13.52]If I touch the water, everything goes away.
[253:19.61]Okay.
[253:32.78]Hey, could you gwe this song?
[253:35.76]Um, let me listen to it again.
[253:42.15]What does it go, guys?
[253:44.33]Oh.
[253:51.66]Oh.
[253:55.55]It's so old.
[253:56.93]Yeah, it is.
[253:58.43]It's a very old meme here, right?
[254:01.25]Let's out of here.
[254:29.65]I am not trapped.
[254:30.61]I'll be OK.
[254:31.17]Because I'm going to make an opening over here.
[254:34.63]The door will probably be right here.
[255:17.39]Coming along.
[255:23.77]Now there's a door right here, isn't there?
[255:25.47]Or am I making that up?
[255:29.22]Isn't there a door right here?
[255:34.12]No, there's not.
[255:35.38]Really?
[255:35.66]Okay.
[255:49.08]Yeah, House Flipper 2 comes out this year, doesn't it?
[255:53.34]In like a few months?
[255:55.30]I think that's when it's planning on coming out.
[255:57.30]4 to 3?
[256:12.09]Cool.
[256:12.29]I 100% will be playing it.
[256:31.24]So now I got to fix that.
[256:35.74]I've got to add the green here and then the walls.
[256:39.56]So let's buy a shitload of the walls.
[256:48.53]I wish the recently purchased was bigger than this.
[256:50.41]Instead of having to go to, you know, walls and then all the way down and
[256:57.52]Because I know what I want.
[256:59.46]Or I could just remember how to type it into the search bar.
[257:01.96]Instead of just glazing over what it's called every single time.
[257:06.79]You guys like this one?
[257:18.38]Oops.
[257:28.43]Okay, floors.
[257:31.51]It was the green.
[257:33.98]Was it a tile or was it a panel?
[257:35.84]It was pretty far down.
[257:36.54]Here it is.
[257:38.26]The Krusty Krab.
[257:56.96]Now, that's it for the floors of the Krusty Krab.
[258:00.05]We're getting close to being done with this.
[258:02.47]Then I just have to finish the upstairs.
[258:03.51]Do I want any weird lights in here?
[258:15.24]Hmm.
[258:23.46]I don't think I want any lights in here.
[258:25.26]Besides the ones that are already there.
[258:39.99]I'm going to put, uh, this should be it though.
[258:42.52]Yeah.
[258:42.70]All right.
[258:43.14]So I need like probably enough.
[258:52.39]What?
[258:56.25]Why do I always have to do that?
[258:59.10]Change the roof.
[258:59.60]Yeah, well, I'll mess around with the exterior in a minute.
[259:08.58]All right, so the next time I play this, which will be at some point soon... I'm not... The stream's not over, by the way.
[259:14.36]But we will actually put cows and horses into stuff.
[259:20.29]You got me on this Krusty Krab thing, and I'm stuck on it.
[259:42.73]Favorite childhood snack.
[259:43.77]That's a good one.
[259:48.19]PB crisps.
[259:50.31]They don't make them anymore.
[259:52.26]I don't know what was in them.
[259:53.84]I don't know why they won't bring them back.
[259:56.40]But those were my favorite snack.
[259:58.62]Probably ever.
[260:00.16]They're gone forever.
[260:03.12]Actually gone forever.
[260:17.63]Mr. Krabs office is so bad.
[260:23.33]Okay, can I put wood on the ceiling?
[260:25.11]Let me see.
[260:39.79]It said panels, right?
[260:41.79]Floor and ceiling?
[260:42.91]Floor and ceiling panels.
[260:44.71]I can.
[260:52.95]What kind of?
[260:53.39]What is it?
[260:53.69]It's a little dark in this.
[261:00.85]This?
[261:04.36]That's kind of alright.
[261:06.48]Is that good enough?
[261:07.04]I think it's fine.
[261:28.92]Can you play less sad music?
[261:33.00]This is a little somber, isn't it?
[261:34.32]Okay, um, how about... What's something we can put on?
[262:00.76]Sims by mode.
[262:03.28]I like that one.
[262:26.68]Cool.
[262:28.04]All right.
[262:29.88]We need to make this area cool looking.
[262:33.12]Relaxing Gran Turismo music to help you relax.
[262:37.64]Really?
[262:48.43]Okay.
[262:49.85]I dig it.
[262:50.31]I'm into it.
[262:57.52]Let's see if it helps.
[263:26.87]What's the outside of the Krusty Krab look like?
[263:29.09]Let's see.
[263:37.55]Krusty Krab, it's kind of green.
[263:39.16]It's kind of like olive.
[264:02.54]brown this looks kind of green it's wood covered with algae oh I mean it's still green looking
[264:27.06]Dude, this shit is green.
[264:28.16]This is literally green.
[264:30.92]This is not... This is not brown.
[264:34.14]This is green.
[264:36.16]This is a green-tinted brown.
[264:49.11]Show us.
[264:49.69]Show us.
[265:02.61]Dude, all these Krusty Krabs.
[265:06.30]Krusty Krab exterior.
[265:07.86]This shit is green!
[265:16.37]Look at this shit's green!

[266:16.72]What is brown?
[266:17.64]Shit's green!
[266:18.32]I thought my game crashed.
[266:23.62]I was supposed to be really sad.
[266:27.26]That's brown with green on it!
[266:29.14]Alright, I don't know why I think that's so funny.
[266:31.79]I'm moving on. ...
[266:48.32]All right.
[266:49.25]All right.
[266:50.19]All right.
[266:50.93]All right.
[267:02.21]Windows jump scare.
[267:03.19]Oh shit.
[267:03.62]Sorry.
[267:03.90]I didn't realize it was turned up.
[267:09.86]Well, just do this.
[267:14.36]I need it.
[267:15.38]No, I'm not doing the exterior.
[267:20.25]I do want to pull in that sign, though.
[267:22.19]The menu.
[267:24.19]Mod linked it here.
[267:29.29]Galley Grub.
[267:30.13]Okay.
[267:31.89]How do I add this?
[267:32.61]I think I have to pull it in.
[267:38.76]Save this link.
[267:39.36]Okay.
[267:50.04]There's so much shit on my desktop.
[267:54.83]Okay.
[267:59.75]Did that even work?
[268:09.56]Uh, window sound incoming.
[268:10.68]Let me turn it down.
[268:19.23]So here's what the... I'm trying to get the menu into the game, and this is what I'm trying to put in here.
[268:23.57]Okay.
[268:27.21]So then I go... I think it's like the camera.
[268:33.06]Gallery.
[268:33.88]Yeah, I got a lot of shit on my desktop, so I'm gonna do this. ...
[268:50.52]All right, let's go.
[268:59.11]How big should it be?
[269:08.27]Where does it go?
[269:08.79]Kind of right there, right?
[269:17.77]Is it bigger?
[269:20.25]Little bit bigger.
[269:36.52]Is that too big?
[269:39.05]That's not bad.
[269:46.25]Can it hang from the ceiling?
[269:47.23]I don't think so, unfortunately.
[269:55.43]Yeah, and everybody was telling me that this was not gonna even look remotely like the Krusty Krab.
[270:01.76]And we're not even done.
[270:03.46]Finishing touches is all that matter.
[270:08.14]The bathroom is way too big.
[270:12.53]I have to do this room.
[270:14.57]This room is just a placeholder.
[270:19.23]I gotta get this a little bit nicer looking.
[270:25.05]Playing with this is to go like this.
[270:26.49]Hmm.
[270:30.91]All right.
[270:31.15]One thing at a time.
[270:43.12]What do I want to add?
[270:44.00]Is there anything down the hallway in the Krusty Krab here?
[270:57.50]It is hanging.
[270:58.08]Oh, there's an order here assigned too.
[271:02.73]I want to see if I can get some nautical stuff here because there's... Let me see.
[271:14.11]What do you put?
[271:14.73]Like an anchor?
[271:15.23]Like a ship anchor.
[271:18.96]Like a ship.
[271:20.44]Oh, okay.
[271:23.80]I know I can put one of these somewhere.
[271:27.78]bingo and where should this go in in the office this needs a total complete reimagining could go to the steam workshop too I could do the steam workshop
[272:01.09]Nice Gmod office, I know.
[272:02.81]There's a mini safe.
[272:07.43]Alright, so is there anything else in this main room that is not here?
[272:12.07]That needs to be here?
[272:22.68]The sinks?
[272:27.52]I can't really put glass over here because it won't
[272:31.95]You need wooden pillars.
[272:34.20]Hmm.
[272:35.22]Wooden pillars.
[272:37.10]Alright.
[272:38.76]Fix the hole.
[272:42.96]Where are the pillars?
[272:43.92]Let me look.
[272:57.32]Okay, they... I don't think I can put those in.
[272:59.64]They go across the ceiling, right?
[273:01.16]Well, look, there's a couple that are on the ground.
[273:05.80]Looks like to the left and right of the door, the entrance.
[273:10.02]So if I go like this... So they're kind of like here and here.
[273:27.98]It's got to be the same on both sides.
[273:36.11]It's a little bit tighter.
[273:37.00]It's like here.
[273:38.36]But for aesthetic reasons, I'm putting it here.
[274:03.51]shit he's still gonna add goats yeah I've I kind of threw away the whole farming dlc and yeah that's unfortunate we'll do it again
[274:36.82]Alright, this is just wood.
[274:40.04]But I don't want to build that yet.
[274:40.92]Alright, so this needs to be like here.
[274:51.46]Right here.
[274:55.87]Woo!
[274:57.67]Should it be thicker?
[274:58.31]To really sell what it is?
[275:33.67]Wood walls.
[275:36.95]These are pretty good.
[275:39.71]They're kind of selling it.
[275:40.63]These are a little dusty.
[275:41.78]Let's try these.
[276:00.78]Use farm animals for customers.
[276:02.65]That's actually a pretty funny idea.
[276:35.17]This is in the corner.
[276:43.47]Very good.
[277:13.60]Is it going to sit a little bit tighter in here?
[277:28.11]Coming together.
[277:31.11]You missed a spot.
[277:40.90]All right.
[277:42.80]Doesn't match, but I don't think it really needs to.
[277:50.32]Bathroom is the way it is.
[277:51.48]This is my sanctuary over here.
[277:56.49]But, eh.
[277:59.07]That'll have to do.
[278:03.31]This is the room I want to tackle now.
[278:07.51]The door to Mr. Krabs' office.
[278:14.03]Is left or right?
[278:16.21]Is it closer to the wall or is it more in the middle?
[278:18.01]It's the one in the middle, right?
[278:25.50]Yeah.
[278:27.46]Yeah.
[278:33.22]Fill this up.
[278:46.15]What about the barrels?
[278:47.89]We'll do some touch up.
[278:54.96]And the door, I'm going to have to keep using these weird sci-fi doors, unfortunately.
[279:28.69]Nice.
[279:38.54]Music's quiet.
[279:39.63]Oops.
[279:58.68]I like it.
[279:59.76]It's cool.
[280:02.55]Here's the fridge, but we keep that closed because I don't want anyone to see.
[280:06.78]Oh, we got more logos.
[280:07.68]Hold on.
[280:10.00]I got to put these in.
[280:30.87]Okay.
[280:33.75]This one too.
[280:36.35]Okay.
[280:55.55]OK.
[280:57.71]Can't see anything.
[280:58.83]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[281:02.97]Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[281:14.38]Might as well.
[281:18.39]Oh, there's a raid.
[281:19.15]Oh my god, I gotta turn the screen back on.
[281:20.75]But I don't want you guys to see this yet.
[281:22.19]Hold on.
[281:22.69]I don't want you to see this.
[281:23.51]This is very important.
[281:24.55]Because this is where my sanctuary is.
[281:26.27]Okay, now I'm okay if you see it.
[281:32.85]I just didn't want you to see this because it's a surprise.
[281:36.90]Hello, welcome.
[281:37.86]Welcome, Vinesauce viewers.
[281:42.22]Thanks a lot, Vinny.
[281:44.81]welcome uh this is a surprise for chat so I'm sorry I took a little bit longer playing house flipper thanks for the raid welcome we are currently um doing something very important we are recreating one to one not a single detail missed of the crusty crab in house flipper I'm doing my best
[282:11.02]I think it's going pretty good so far.
[282:12.82]We're working on it.
[282:17.64]And then I've also, of course, besides the Krusty Krab, I also have my sanctuary over here, which has been recently updated.
[282:31.25]Ah.
[282:38.47]I'm leaving this house.
[282:50.56]Please don't mind the poop chairs.
[282:51.82]They're temporary.
[282:52.56]All right.
[282:54.78]Hold on.
[282:55.06]I got some other things to put in here.
[283:00.74]This is much smaller, right?
[283:02.42]Yeah.
[283:05.16]Like right there.
[283:05.76]How am I going to do this?
[283:22.85]I don't think that works.
[283:24.81]Can I put it on a tree?
[283:36.72]I, why do I feel like I'm walking through one of those like Disney experiences where it's the crusty.
[283:44.79]Whoa, whoa.
[283:45.71]I can actually walk around the crusty crab.
[283:48.77]This is so cool.
[283:50.75]And then it's just a store in here.
[283:53.31]It's just a huge gift shop with tons of toys and plushes and stickers and... And you can eat here.
[284:04.72]You can sit here and eat here.
[284:05.88]But hey, those of you that just joined us and some of you that have been here before...
[284:16.58]Some of you that have been here for a while have not seen all of it.
[284:19.82]So, of course, this is... We're not done.
[284:22.56]This is obviously Spongebob's office.
[284:26.04]Spongebob's work area.
[284:27.14]He's the cook.
[284:27.56]We got the window here.
[284:28.32]Made a little bit of cleaning up here.
[284:29.44]There's a lot to do here.
[284:31.92]But wait till you see Mr. Krabs' office.
[284:35.42]I'm telling you right now.
[284:37.04]You are about to be floored with how accurate this is.
[284:44.60]But here's the bathroom, though.
[284:51.89]A little bit of extra space.
[284:56.29]All the toilets work.
[285:02.70]Dude, the floor is really carrying.
[285:04.64]It really is.
[285:05.50]Without this floor, it was awful.
[285:12.24]Alright.
[285:13.26]I'm happy with this so far.
[285:14.62]I think this is going pretty well.
[285:21.55]Let's tackle this room.
[285:25.58]I don't love it.
[285:27.64]I don't love it.
[285:29.82]Okay.
[285:32.82]What was Vinny playing tonight?
[285:33.64]What was Vinny doing?
[285:44.70]90s stuff?
[285:45.04]Ooh.
[285:47.04]Ooh.
[285:48.93]obscure 90s websites ooh sounds pretty good okay we need a shelf over here there's another uh grill that's there's a second grill right old virtual world
[286:44.82]It's too big.
[286:45.64]I can't put it anywhere.
[286:46.88]I would pay $35,000 for that.
[286:54.81]I wouldn't.
[286:55.15]Uh...
[287:10.84]Okay, so I need an oven or a stove.
[287:14.24]There's a second one.
[287:14.86]What color is it?
[287:15.52]It's like there's a couple of barrels.
[287:19.34]Let me put the barrels in first because I think those go against the back wall.
[287:24.52]Barrel.
[287:25.07]There we go.
[287:27.99]Yeah, these go like here.
[287:29.21]I think there's two.
[287:33.69]Good.
[287:41.88]Oh, the ceiling needs to be wood.
[287:43.74]Shit.
[287:45.92]All right, well, I got to do that right now.
[287:53.08]Don't forget the Krabby Patty poster.
[287:56.15]Can I get a mod link me the Krabby Patty poster?
[288:18.73]You know what the craziest part about this house is?
[288:22.35]There's an entire upstairs that has bedrooms and bathrooms in it.
[288:29.10]And it's sealed off forever.
[288:31.51]Never to be opened.
[288:42.98]that's pretty clear I need to fix the walls over there got plenty of these good okay make sure you add a secret ladder to the upstairs crack attic
[289:08.74]Yeah, I'm going to hide that though because I don't want anybody to see it.
[289:12.26]So I'm going to hide it like over here.
[289:15.49]I'm not even sure I can get upstairs ever again.
[289:21.12]I'm serious.
[289:21.86]I don't think I can get up there.
[289:41.08]What the hell?
[289:46.76]Oh, cool.
[289:59.39]You can change the roof?
[290:06.13]Huh?
[290:09.85]Wait, I didn't process that at all.
[290:11.29]How do I get to the roof tool?
[290:25.24]Ooh, cool.
[290:25.82]Hold on.
[290:26.06]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[290:34.00]What's the top of the Krusty Krab?
[290:35.54]Wood?
[290:35.66]Wood?
[290:53.77]Yeah, nobody's gonna look at the roof.
[290:54.69]Alright, well, this is in the wrong spot.
[290:56.13]So, where am I gonna put this?
[290:57.34]I mean, that can stay, but... So, I need to... It's gotta be, like... Oh, wait, wait.
[291:05.49]From my sanctuary, right.
[291:08.45]That makes sense.
[291:22.68]Where the hell is the rest of the house?
[291:48.25]Put it above the pool?
[291:49.28]Yeah, I was just trying to but I don't think I can get up there.
[291:58.77]It doesn't like that the pool is there.
[291:59.83]Um, there's a bathtub up there.
[292:19.00]I think it has to just be maybe wait.
[292:23.00]Okay.
[292:23.18]Wait, wait, wait.
[292:23.72]Maybe in the corner.
[292:26.89]I can do it right... Okay, I can do it right here.
[292:30.04]I want this to be hidden though.
[292:43.23]Perfect.
[292:45.10]Fuck.
[292:59.91]Alright, what is it?
[293:01.37]Did I do it again?
[293:02.58]I don't care.
[293:03.96]Nice.
[293:13.67]Grab your patty only at the Krusty Krab.
[293:22.98]Oh, I'll take that one.
[293:29.76]Wait a minute, what is that?
[293:30.46]I'm taking this downstairs.
[293:45.10]Would a mirror be better here?
[293:46.26]A mirror on this side and a mirror on that side.
[293:51.44]That would be kind of fine, right?
[294:06.76]Oh, no.
[294:09.50]All right.
[294:10.38]There are some boxes in here.
[294:11.96]I got the food over there.
[294:14.70]I got the two barrels.
[294:19.00]There is a window.
[294:20.34]I actually think this is pretty good so far.
[294:34.09]Oh, wait, hold on.
[294:36.09]Yep.
[294:36.43]All right.
[294:36.71]Krusty Krab.
[294:37.39]Only Krabby Patty.
[294:38.15]Only the Krusty Krab.
[294:38.73]All right.
[294:39.05]Hold on.
[294:39.55]I don't want to spoil.
[294:54.12]Okay.
[294:55.38]Any more?
[295:05.99]Any more I should put in?
[295:06.71]I think that'll do it.
[295:17.98]Yeah, that should be fine.
[295:18.66]That should tie the whole room together.
[295:38.27]OK, now you can look.
[295:48.90]It's not that big, it's a little smaller.
[295:57.89]Yes.
[296:01.53]Not bad.
[296:09.86]This is kind of ugly, but... Put the vampire picture view behind.
[296:20.13]No, that's for my sanctuary.
[296:24.49]I need some lights in here.
[296:25.79]I need a nice light, and I'll be happy.
[296:31.40]Just something very basic.
[296:39.61]Mood lighting, exactly.
[296:42.97]String lights.
[296:44.95]Do they have any?
[296:48.03]I don't think they do.
[296:49.93]Unfortunately.
[296:54.75]It's okay.
[297:03.34]Maybe like the chandelier.
[297:04.20]Ah.
[297:11.23]I hate this picture.
[297:12.13]It's so stupid.
[297:17.39]It's too well lit for that photo to be in here.
[297:21.67]What about like candles?
[297:22.89]Candles make more sense.
[297:46.41]Hold on, hold on.
[297:47.22]I'm gonna make a Bloodborne room.
[297:48.58]I'm gonna make a Dark Souls... I'm gonna make a From Software room.
[298:21.07]Pretty good.
[298:28.86]Now put a bonfire in the middle.
[298:33.99]I'm sorry, there's not enough candles in this room.
[299:07.48]Okay, now it's officially from software room.
[299:19.20]Dude, why is this your grave?
[299:21.70]Vampire Jerva grave.
[299:26.79]How did it get darker?
[299:28.03]How did it get darker?
[299:28.95]Imagine this shit's on your walls.
[299:38.46]Wait, is there like a coffin?
[299:39.78]Hold on, is there like a vampire coffin?
[299:42.14]Why would there be when I'm looking?
[299:44.92]Oh my goodness, there is.
[299:46.23]In the Krusty Krab.
[300:16.52]I think the candles are going out.
[300:17.81]I think that's the problem.
[300:48.61]Alright, needs to be bigger than this.
[300:49.49]I think that's a good size.
[301:23.50]Yeah, he wanted to be put into a casket in his sanctuary room.
[301:30.69]He's not in there.
[301:31.41]He just really liked this place.
[301:38.55]He's in there.
[301:39.85]Don't open that.
[301:49.88]Okay.
[301:51.66]Open, have it, have the casket open.
[301:53.58]I don't think I can.
[301:58.96]I love it.
[301:59.40]All right.
[301:59.82]I need a door there.
[302:00.64]Or should that not even be a door?
[302:03.72]Is it just, you can just waltz into this.
[302:13.83]Okay.
[302:14.77]Um, I need like a shitty door.
[302:17.39]It's like a rickety door.
[302:26.85]This might scare the shit out of somebody too.
[302:40.53]It's an outhouse, yeah.
[302:41.97]Please wash your... Oh, hold on.
[302:44.35]I got another image.
[302:58.78]This is a good one.
[303:02.90]This is a weird question.
[303:03.82]Does anybody have any more vampire pictures of me?
[303:06.92]That's a weird question to ask.
[303:23.05]Okay, hold on.
[303:26.62]Do you want safe?
[303:27.88]All right.
[303:28.60]Okay.
[303:35.17]Look at this.
[303:35.61]Ready?
[303:35.83]Yeah.
[303:53.32]Turn the stream off, dude.
[303:59.17]We'll probably get in close once we start doing shit like this.
[304:01.31]Oh my god!
[304:07.13]Alright, that one has- That's going- I don't- This- This is- Why would- Why do you have this?
[304:13.37]Why do you have this already?
[304:14.93]Like, why do you own this?
[304:16.13]I don't- I can't understand why you would own this image.
[304:29.46]And the question is, does, is this what goes on top of the door or is this go in the room too?
[304:43.17]I'll let you see in a second.
[304:53.55]Is this, is this like an advertisement for like who's in here?
[305:03.86]I want to put like a big floodlight on that.
[305:10.70]Oh, geez.
[305:12.58]Hold on.
[305:13.12]All right.
[305:13.42]Let me add one more.
[305:14.46]And this is not turning into the saw house again.
[305:16.39]But like, this is just too much.
[305:21.03]How is this?
[305:21.39]I can't believe this is a real person's face.
[305:23.31]I honestly don't understand how this is a real human being.
[305:37.48]No spoilers.
[305:42.74]Hold on.
[305:46.89]I hate this so much.
[305:51.09]You know, honestly, though, I'll be honest.
[305:52.65]I've come to terms over the years.
[305:57.41]With just how truly fucking strange my face can look sometimes.
[306:03.50]And it's just funny.
[306:04.78]I don't even care.
[306:13.37]The question is, where does this one go?
[306:33.77]That's not even a part, that's not even me.
[306:39.65]Alright, I think I'm done.
[306:41.13]I think I'm done.
[306:42.13]I think we've gone a little bit too far.
[306:46.29]I think I'm done.
[306:47.35]No, I want the before and after pictures.
[306:59.99]Oh shit, I forgot about this.
[307:02.07]Hold on.
[307:02.63]I want the before and after photos.
[307:06.64]Make sure to move your office here.
[307:10.27]Do one final tour?
[307:11.71]Okay.
[307:13.71]Welcome.
[307:14.81]And maybe we're not done.
[307:16.81]I'll make sure to move my office here.
[307:21.85]Wait.
[307:22.93]Don't forget about the garden.
[307:26.74]Don't forget about the full send Spongebob left.
[307:29.06]Okay.
[307:31.58]Okay.
[307:40.51]I can't do it.
[307:54.75]Should these be in the room here?
[307:56.27]I didn't like that at all.
[308:08.75]Find me somebody that did.
[308:19.35]What about the animal customers?
[308:22.91]All right, let's get some animal customers in here.
[308:39.49]Where are they?
[308:46.48]Where are they?
[308:58.00]arming how did I find it before oh wait wait I think it's actually from a different menu I think I have to do it from the laptop yeah all right I gotta move my office let me save this and we're gonna go back to my office so back to the office save the progress
[309:32.62]Could I have done it from that menu?
[309:34.18]Oh, shit.
[309:34.76]I thought I had to use... I thought I had to pick up the laptop and move it there.
[309:41.87]So, could I have actually just gone there?
[309:43.77]Oh, shit.
[309:44.43]Oops.
[309:49.54]Okay, I own this.
[310:00.32]The option was immediately beneath what you clicked.
[310:02.54]Yeah, but when you have tunnel vision like I do sometimes.
[310:22.50]What's burning?
[310:32.39]right well let's see how that's going mr grabs room it's in development by the way okay so we just have uh animal customers
[311:22.29]I just want to see what I'm just curious.
[311:24.45]I don't even know if I can do this.
[311:58.73]What?
[312:28.17]Why can't I move?
[312:37.13]Oh, look at the little pig.
[312:38.11]You guys want to see?
[312:50.78]Alright, follow me.
[312:52.30]Take a look at this place.
[313:15.99]Alright, I'm ready.
[313:30.50]Here's a carrot.
[313:35.56]No, these are Spongebob characters.
[313:38.58]That's Squidward.
[313:39.52]Oh, wait, hold on.
[313:54.17]Okay.
[313:56.47]What about the pig?
[314:08.48]This is cute.
[314:09.12]I like this.
[314:22.38]What's wrong?
[314:25.60]Are you okay?
[314:26.00]Are you good?
[314:27.08]Doesn't need anything.
[314:38.21]And there are other, there's other animals out here.
[314:40.53]Oh, hi.
[314:41.19]Hello.

[315:32.61]Okay, I need... Um, where do I buy food?
[315:38.39]Oh no, animal care, it's right here.
[315:44.02]Okay.
[315:49.34]Imagine going to a place, like a restaurant, and there was just, like, cow and pig feeding troughs inside.
[315:56.97]Okay.
[316:07.91]It's a salad bar.
[316:09.05]Yeah, that's true.
[316:09.76]I need water.
[316:39.72]Oh, okay.
[316:40.74]They're eating.
[316:42.26]Okay, they're eating.
[316:42.74]They're eating.
[316:43.18]You just ate the whole thing?
[316:44.00]What?
[316:50.02]Oh, no.
[316:50.30]The secret formula.
[316:53.83]It's pig slop.
[316:56.61]Oh, wait.
[316:57.47]The big one's coming in.
[317:10.46]I need some water.
[317:16.53]Like a watering thing, right?
[317:18.53]Here we go.
[317:18.75]Alright, things are going good.
[317:46.50]Why are there farm animals in this?
[317:48.26]I'm so lost.
[317:49.52]Um, this is a new update and we're just literally playing it for the first time.
[317:53.51]Right now.
[317:54.71]Not the last, like, five and a half hours.
[318:05.42]What are you- What is that animal?
[318:08.02]Is it you?
[318:14.47]Alpacas really do just look like spore characters.
[318:16.83]Is it good?
[318:34.40]Oh, you eat grass.
[318:53.85]Where did it go?
[319:00.93]Okay.
[319:09.70]Alright, that's it.
[319:11.90]I could get some more animals, but I think I'm going to call it
[319:22.36]Look at a bunch of spiders, oh my god.
[319:27.04]I can sleep?
[319:48.71]Here.
[319:53.51]Get out of the way!
[320:03.26]Okay, well, how do I get the before and after photos?
[320:23.49]I think I have to sell the house.
[320:25.11]But I don't know if I want to sell this one.
[320:30.78]This one's too special to me.
[320:32.32]Alright, follow me, please.
[320:49.88]Can you buy a duplicate?
[320:51.20]Um, you actually might be able to.
[320:53.44]Alright, it is my office now.
[321:02.04]Oh my god.
[321:06.09]Is it move button?
[321:11.37]Alright, I think that's it.
[321:13.77]That was a lot of fun.
[321:15.15]I'll probably play this again, but we'll actually make a farm next time.
[321:17.93]And not... Krusty Krab.
[321:22.63]It was fun to hang out and play for a little while.
[321:30.84]Make the chum bucket next.
[321:40.06]Ah, thanks for hanging out.
[321:41.96]I'll give one final tour for those that didn't get to see every room.
[321:51.59]We're gonna start.
[321:52.43]Okay.
[321:53.65]Alright, it's time.
[321:54.99]How do I move?
[321:57.23]Move.
[321:58.54]What?
[322:01.46]Oh.
[322:03.42]This is not right.
[322:06.92]Something's not right.
[322:17.88]Okay.
[322:18.00]What happened to the horse?
[322:27.27]Where's the horse?
[322:37.32]Huh?
[322:38.66]Where's my horse?
[322:40.52]Upstairs, maybe.
[322:41.30]Alright, well, let's do the tour.
[322:43.44]Welcome to the Krusty Krab.
[322:44.42]I have... We make our own fresh ingredients here.
[322:49.80]Apparently we don't because nothing's been planted in months, I guess.
[322:53.71]Never mind.
[322:54.09]Here's the front door.
[323:01.09]We got nice glass over here.
[323:03.66]Well, there was supposed to be glass over there.
[323:05.20]Yeah, don't mind the pigs and the cows and the animals and stuff.
[323:14.87]They're just hanging out.
[323:21.22]You can come in.
[323:23.12]Alright, so here's the Krusty Krab.
[323:25.44]Pretty good.
[323:26.08]I added some extra stuff.
[323:32.57]Take it right here.
[323:33.63]Please wash your fins.
[323:39.23]Bathroom.
[323:43.69]This is a secret exit.
[323:46.39]Which goes to the roof.
[323:47.81]Just in case you need to use it.
[323:55.25]Do we need the bathroom?
[323:58.95]There are no sinks in the bathroom.
[324:00.23]That's unfortunate.
[324:01.43]I'll fix that next time.
[324:03.27]Here is SpongeBob's room.
[324:09.98]A shot-for-shot remake.
[324:11.36]We can put some stuff here and there.
[324:19.74]This is Mr. Krabs' office.
[324:20.80]It's a work in progress.
[324:32.69]Oh, and of course, the vampire room.
[324:36.17]Or the From Software room.
[324:37.35]Whatever one you want to call it.
[324:43.51]Beautiful square pool.
[324:51.27]Pretty nice.
[325:01.09]What was that?
[325:05.49]Is that shit?
[325:22.60]What is that animal?
[325:24.10]I swear.
[325:24.70]Okay, so there's that, and then there's the upstairs, which is the living quarters.
[325:35.44]Very cool.
[325:37.72]This still needs to be moved into.
[325:40.18]I'm thinking of a big flat screen television right here.
[325:42.63]Nice bath.
[325:46.55]Maybe upgrade the bath a little.
[325:48.63]Could be a little yoga studio.
[325:55.55]Go ahead.
[326:15.07]You're very well behaved.
[326:17.01]You're very nice.
[326:17.81]You want some?
[326:23.90]Address the horse?
[326:24.54]I don't know where the horse is.
[326:26.28]Horse is fine.
[326:51.94]The horse is not fine.
[326:58.36]Oh no, you're good.
[327:01.64]Alright.
[327:02.69]Everybody's doing good.
[327:05.41]I'm going to save it.
[327:07.01]And I'm going to call it.
[327:09.27]So I mentioned that I was probably going to take a little bit of a break.
[327:17.82]But not really.
[327:19.36]Really.
[327:21.06]Wednesday, this coming week, Stir and I are going to play some games.
[327:25.46]But besides Wednesday, I don't really have a plan.
[327:29.71]So Wednesday, we're going to play, hanging out, Stir and I. And then maybe another stream later this coming week.
[327:39.37]But Holly and I are going to take a little bit of a break.
[327:46.47]been doing a lot of grotto beast stuff and we're incredibly happy that a lot of people have been getting their stuff but a lot of work to do still uh up until I want to say a day or two ago that's really kind of where I was for four or five straight days off stream doing all the grotto beast stuff
[328:13.65]But I think we need to take a little bit of time together.
[328:16.39]But I'll see you Wednesday.
[328:20.27]After Wednesday, maybe this weekend.
[328:26.36]It scares me every... Actually, it scares me every time.
[328:33.13]But break as in there's only going to be like one or two streams over the next week or so.
[328:42.86]Yeah, thanks for watching.
[328:43.85]This was fun.
[328:44.71]Pretty great update.
[328:45.67]I'm glad you can actually finally build a house.
[328:50.61]Adding additions to houses was always something I begged for five years ago.
[328:56.23]But you can finally build a house from the bottom up.
[329:02.48]So that's a huge deal.
[329:04.96]Can you please pet the baby pig?
[329:06.68]Yes.
[329:10.04]Come here.
[329:12.18]find truffles?
[329:28.06]Did you find one?
[329:28.68]This kind of looks like Otto with no hair.
[329:48.00]Have a tomato.
[329:57.62]You don't have to find any truffles.
[329:58.84]You can just relax.
[330:04.79]I love autumn.
[330:05.33]Why do you want to go in there so bad?
[330:19.67]What are the... Wait, aren't the ingredients to a Krabby Patty... It's not meat, right?
[330:23.41]Isn't it something else?
[330:34.88]Is it just fish?
[330:36.46]Crab?
[330:37.78]It's crab meat.
[330:42.57]It's a secret.
[330:45.95]Oh.
[330:47.58]It's human meat.
[330:49.46]It's veggie meat?
[330:50.46]I don't think anybody knows.
[330:51.30]Alright, I'll see you guys on Wednesday.
[330:56.04]I'll hit up Stir and see exactly what we want to do.
[331:03.57]He mentioned he wanted to play Orcs Must Die 3.
[331:05.39]So it might be a gamer stream on Wednesday.
[331:12.55]We also need to watch him play Five Nights at Freddy's.
[331:17.60]I'm imagining that will probably be part of that stream too.
[331:19.64]We'll see.
[331:32.02]This music was actually pretty relaxing.
[331:33.32]This is Gran Turismo.
[331:36.14]Gran Turismo.
[331:38.28]Cool.
[331:42.44]Okay.
[331:45.25]Wait, let me make sure I save this.
[331:50.20]Uh, yeah, it's saved.
[331:53.85]Whoops.
[331:55.45]All right.
[332:04.22]And the music, I did not forget the music.
[332:21.72]There it is.
[332:29.53]Yeah, also, by the way, just to remind everybody one more time, the limited items are about to leave the store in 15-20 minutes for Grotto Beasts.
[332:44.95]Yeah, in about 10 minutes, 10-20.
[332:47.19]At 11.59, the limited stuff is going off the store.
[332:55.23]That is the glow-in-the-dark apparel.
[332:58.49]That's the original 40 Grotto Beasts.
[333:00.63]And all the posters.
[333:02.37]Bugleberry, Zaraxos, and Glue Man.
[333:07.11]Those are all going off.
[333:09.98]And I think the hats are going off, too.
[333:12.66]The cards are still there, though.
[333:16.68]And we, uh... For those of you that are still waiting for shipping updates...
[333:22.44]We are working on that right now.
[333:24.59]For those of you that don't know, some of the early orders had some kind of issue.
[333:31.60]A ton of orders have already gone out.
[333:34.08]A massive amount of orders have been shipped and people have got it and we've seen a lot of
[333:38.83]really cool openings and unboxings and we're just really happy that people like it but we want to make sure that the people that are still waiting for the shipping update that they actually get as of tomorrow morning we're meeting with represent so we're going to be talking about it trying to figure out a game plan but it looks like it looks like they're going to be starting to really go back and take a look at all those so we're working on it we are those of you that are still waiting
[334:13.27]The regular Grotto Bee shirts are still up and they are staying there.
[334:16.79]Yes, like the logo shirt.
[334:18.23]Logo hoodie.
[334:20.77]And obviously the cards.
[334:25.59]Yeah, the starter kit and the cards are all going to be there.
[334:29.41]I will tell you, the starter kits are not going to see a reprint.
[334:33.15]The plan is not to do a second print of the starter kit.
[334:41.56]And the still inventory...
[334:45.98]But that's something that is not going to see a reprint.
[334:49.91]And we likely, depending on how it all goes, we did a second print of the boosters already.
[334:58.15]So we'll see how that goes.
[334:58.91]We'll see how much inventory we have and make some decisions as that goes forward.
[335:06.94]Yeah.
[335:07.36]Just want to give you some updates.
[335:12.64]What about a second edition?
[335:17.40]What about the Uncrusty Dorado Beast ad?
[335:20.31]Yep.
[335:21.99]I would expect that in the next few days.
[335:23.53]Yeah, just know that if you are still waiting, if you had a March estimated ship,
[335:33.83]uh we are actively actively working on it and thankfully it's it doesn't seem like it's a very large amount of people but it's still even if it's a smaller percentage of all the orders or whatever it is wait I don't we don't want that right so we're trying to actively figure out how to fix it so yes the non glow in the dark stuff is staying
[336:05.06]But the art prints are about to go away, yes.
[336:09.29]Holly, do I have that right?
[336:11.05]Is the non-glow-in-the-dark hoodie staying?
[336:14.61]Or are both of those going?
[336:21.33]Okay, so the non-glow-in-the-dark is staying.
[336:26.02]So the one with the ghost on it.
[336:31.16]Yeah, regular ink is staying, logo is staying, and the cards.
[336:33.94]Everything else is going.
[336:37.42]Is the glow in the dark going to be gone forever?
[336:40.52]We don't have a plan to bring it back.
[336:49.23]But I don't know.
[336:50.11]We're just trying to get through this first period to make sure everybody gets their cards.
[336:54.61]Everybody's happy.
[337:06.09]That's priority number one right now.
[337:12.59]And with that... We'll see you Wednesday.
[337:17.13]We probably won't bring it back because as limited as some of this stuff is... The cards, we have inventory.
[337:26.76]And when the inventory's gone, that's... Especially the starter kits.
[337:31.88]We're not doing a second print on those.
[337:35.11]Well, the music didn't get looped.
[337:37.91]Stupid idiot loop the music next time people are counting on you to play it.
[337:51.42]What was my favorite color?
[337:52.88]My favorite color was the color of the pool.
[337:57.96]That I built in House Flipper.
[338:06.54]Alright, see you guys later.
[338:07.36]See you Wednesday.
[338:07.80]Take care of yourselves.
[338:09.62]Have a great night.
[338:10.10]Call your mother.
[338:11.40]See you soon.
[339:05.89]you
