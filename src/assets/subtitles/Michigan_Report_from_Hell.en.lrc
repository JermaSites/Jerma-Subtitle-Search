[00:30.87]Hi everybody.
[00:33.69]Welcome to a stream.
[00:36.99]You've been here before.
[00:39.37]Don't get to tell you what we do here.
[00:43.51]Late note, we're starting early tonight.
[00:44.75]Because I am all fucked up.
[00:49.18]We got some good news and we got some bad news.
[00:52.44]I'll explain what it is in a minute.
[00:55.90]Good news.
[00:57.34]Bad news.
[01:00.28]So just hang tight.
[01:01.66]People will trickle in and we're going to talk about the good news and the bad news.
[01:04.01]See you in a second.
[02:00.14]Alright, so what do you want?
[02:01.04]You want the bad news first or the good news first?
[02:03.06]Which one do you prefer?
[02:05.47]Usually you give the bad news first, right?
[02:11.81]Yeah, that's how like a doctor does it.
[02:15.23]You know, he comes in and he's like, I got good news and bad news.
[02:17.27]What do you want first?
[02:18.29]And you're like, I'll give him the bad news, doc.
[02:19.81]And he's like, okay.
[02:20.51]Alright, yeah, alright, alright.
[02:24.59]So the bad news is, I was developing a head cold yesterday, and the day before a little bit.
[02:31.90]And I got a little bit of a head cold, but it wasn't a big deal.
[02:35.12]But I decided to take NyQuil last night.
[02:40.53]And it like royally fucked me up.
[02:43.65]I'm still groggy, and I'm still cognitively all screwed up from taking it.
[02:48.31]I don't usually take NyQuil, but I was like, yeah, you know what, fine.
[02:51.48]I'm still feeling the effects of it.
[02:53.54]I'm all fucked up.
[02:54.81]I don't know why My brain is just like not there right now.
[03:00.59]I don't take NyQuil.
[03:02.13]It's not good So the good news is We got stable internet.
[03:11.82]I don't know if you see this or not No drop frames
[03:17.15]They finally fixed the fucking problem.
[03:20.37]And by fixed, I mean... Cautious, pessimistic optimism here.
[03:27.77]Because... Technician came out yesterday.
[03:31.32]I mean, I was obviously supposed to stream yesterday, but I didn't.
[03:34.20]Because this was happening.
[03:36.02]Technician came out.
[03:37.40]They said they found the source of the interference.
[03:40.62]They fixed that source of the interference, and I shouldn't be seeing it anymore.
[03:44.84]Unfortunately, I did run a fake stream overnight last night.
[03:52.09]And, you know, I spent probably at least two hours over the course of the day, then three hours.
[03:57.76]And there was a bunch of dropped frames if I tried to stream at like 5,000 up.
[04:02.28]But...
[04:05.46]4,500 up seems to be perfect.
[04:09.32]So, gonna have to take what we got, right?
[04:12.42]So, I have a stable upload, stable connection at 4,500 up.
[04:17.70]No drop frames at all, been live for about five minutes, zero, right?
[04:22.66]So, I mean, you pick your battles.
[04:26.24]Can't stream at 5,000 up anymore, but 4,500, whatever.
[04:32.57]It's not a big deal.
[04:34.38]And until I move, we'll have to deal with that.
[04:36.64]If they can stay like this, I'm fine with losing 500k up.
[04:41.12]It's okay.
[04:43.18]Now, you might see a little bit of instability.
[04:46.13]It's not perfect.
[04:47.89]But from all my testing, it seems like maybe... Maybe 0.5 to 0.6% of frames drop during the course of two or three hours.
[04:57.89]Now, who knows?
[04:58.51]I might just get super screwed here.
[05:03.07]And it was just an anomaly.
[05:04.92]And we dropped like 20,000 frames tonight.
[05:08.00]And then, I don't know what to do.
[05:10.22]But it seems to be stable at 4,500.
[05:13.74]So, today, I'm going to fight through this super NyQuil grogginess that I can't get away from.
[05:20.33]And we're going to do what we were supposed to do last week.
[05:23.47]We're going to play Michigan Report from Hell.
[05:28.05]This game looks fucking hilarious, it looks like a lot of fun.
[05:31.39]Hopefully we stay stable enough to enjoy it for a few hours.
[05:33.67]Apparently the game's not very long, but long and short of it is, it's an old PlayStation 2 game where you don't do anything, you're just a cameraman.
[05:43.44]And you walk around and you film horrible shit.
[05:47.04]So.
[05:48.94]I'm interested, I'm excited.
[05:50.06]So why don't we get started.
[05:53.52]How do you guys feel about that?
[05:54.54]PlayStation 2.
[06:00.20]This game's awful.
[06:01.52]Well, here's the thing.
[06:02.95]This game was made by Suda51.
[06:06.27]Isn't he supposed to be, like, a Superman?
[06:10.15]It was, like, game development from Japan.
[06:13.50]Well, regardless... Oh, you can't even hear it.
[06:15.50]What a fucking idiot I am.
[06:16.84]There you go.
[06:19.10]Comcast redeemed stream.
[06:20.20]No, they found the issue.
[06:21.64]They...
[06:23.12]And this is what I was told, and I still have trouble believing this, but before we get started, let me run by this real quick.
[06:28.80]Oh, by the way, you ever drive on the road?
[06:31.58]This is completely unrelated, but I remember I wanted to talk about this on stream.
[06:35.34]Those of you guys that drive around, you know when birds just fly right down in front of your car?
[06:41.35]They just like, when you're driving like 40, 50 miles per hour on the road?
[06:47.39]I've never hit a bird before.
[06:50.65]How is it possible that birds don't just keep getting hit by cars?
[06:53.59]They fly right in front of your fucking car.
[06:58.99]I swear to God, the next time you're out driving, like, pay attention to the amount of birds that almost just run right into your windshield.
[07:08.14]It's never happened, but I feel like it happens like 30 times a road trip.
[07:11.97]Driving 10 minutes.
[07:14.35]Anyways.
[07:18.48]They fixed the problem.
[07:20.52]I can actually stream without any issues, hopefully.
[07:23.20]And that's the long and short of it.
[07:28.27]Oh, new game.
[07:29.63]I don't have any idea what this game is.
[07:31.45]It was just highly recommended.
[07:34.61]So let's start Michigan Report from Hell.
[07:37.83]Basic controls, left analog stick is move, cameraman, right analog stick, change camera direction.
[07:43.29]L2 is RAM, hold down for a more powerful shove.
[07:46.46]X button, focus on the object in view.
[07:49.16]Okay.
[07:50.10]Yo.
[07:52.00]So you're the new cameraman, huh?
[07:54.40]I hear you're a rookie.
[07:56.58]The name's Briscoe.
[07:58.46]I'm the side guy.
[08:00.83]Nice to meet you.
[08:02.63]That's Pamela.
[08:04.85]You've seen her before, haven't you?
[08:08.44]She's a Zaka TV star reporter after all.
[08:12.68]Hey, you're pretty lucky to be teamed up with Pamela right off the bat.
[08:19.61]Oh, cool.
[08:21.15]But don't go getting any funny ideas about her, you hear me?
[08:26.55]Of course, Pamela probably wouldn't give you the time of day.
[08:30.68]What's going on with this game?
[08:31.94]I don't know.
[08:33.18]I think something's fucked up.
[08:34.44]What could the agency be thinking?
[08:38.52]I mean, sending a newbie like this guy out to get scoops?
[08:43.54]Why is it slowed down?
[08:44.94]Oops.
[08:45.90]You hear that?
[08:48.03]Oh, well.
[08:49.35]Don't let it bother you.
[08:51.05]I don't know why it's slowed down.
[08:52.83]It wasn't slowed down before.
[08:54.47]I'll be teaching you everything you need to know about TV news coverage.
[09:00.97]Listen up.
[09:01.93]Do exactly as I say.
[09:03.75]Sounds like he's had a few drinks.
[09:06.76]I think the speed might be an issue here.
[09:10.30]Alright, what do I do?
[09:10.78]Look at what?
[09:12.68]What do I need to do?
[09:13.48]Of course.
[09:14.60]A cameraman's number one job is to be able to shoot things properly.
[09:21.51]Doesn't get any more basic than that.
[09:23.57]Doesn't get any more basic than that.
[09:24.53]You know what to do, right?
[09:26.97]Okay.
[09:28.11]First off, try shooting that box there.
[09:32.84]This box.
[09:34.02]Focus on the box.
[09:37.65]Okay.
[09:39.84]Focusing on box.
[09:42.84]It's just an ordinary box.
[09:46.08]Alright, Briscoe, what's the matter with you?
[09:51.70]Yeah?
[09:52.28]This is Briscoe, right?
[09:54.78]Fine.
[09:56.01]Fine.
[09:56.27]You should be able to do at least that much if you call yourself a cameraman.
[10:01.51]Okay, gotta find the scoops.
[10:03.15]Am I wasting battery?
[10:03.69]What the fuck?
[10:04.48]Oh, I have an alarm set for some reason.
[10:05.84]This is a horror game, by the way.
[10:07.36]Okay.
[10:07.48]Okay.
[10:30.53]There are spots called focus points hidden throughout the city.
[10:33.85]Move around now and try to find some of these focus points.
[10:39.99]This looks like a focus point.
[10:41.45]Okay.
[10:42.05]That's the reporter.
[10:47.25]You?
[10:48.03]Yeah?
[10:49.61]If you focus on the reporter and lock onto her, you can move along with her, keeping the camera steady on her.
[10:56.20]Okay.
[10:58.48]Focus points hidden in the city explain the controls.
[11:01.12]They also provide hints and tips to help you along.
[11:05.26]Good luck finding them.
[11:08.49]Yeah.
[11:09.89]Yeah.
[11:10.39]Go back to Briscoe to continue the tutorial.
[11:12.09]Okay.
[11:12.19]Alright.
[11:13.77]What do you got for me?
[11:15.21]Did you find anything?
[11:16.45]I found the reporter.
[11:17.45]Okay.
[11:18.23]Next topic.
[11:20.37]Ramming is a technique you can use in a pinch.
[11:23.89]I'm going to ram my fist inside of your stomach.
[11:26.38]You see?
[11:27.73]He can't take his hands off the camera.
[11:30.89]Okay, try ramming into me right now.
[11:33.43]What's on his shirt?
[11:34.56]Not too hard though, you hear?
[11:36.16]Is he got frogs on his shirt?
[11:37.44]Is that a turtle?
[11:38.04]I don't know what it is.
[11:38.66]Alright, go ahead and try it.
[11:41.04]Take it easy.
[11:42.78]We're just practicing here, remember?
[11:45.22]Okay, go.
[11:47.04]Easy now.
[11:47.66]Alright, I get it.
[11:48.86]Can I have control please?
[11:49.96]Alright, L2.
[11:54.22]I'm just getting real angry.
[11:55.70]Oh, I didn't... Hold on.
[11:58.70]I just shake the... Alright, then you let go.
[12:00.82]Wait, I... Hey, you idiot!
[12:08.12]That's a tuba on his shirt?
[12:09.56]I told you to take it easy!
[12:11.12]A tuba?
[12:11.90]Son of a... That's not a tuba.
[12:15.48]That's like Franklin the Frog.
[12:18.34]You'll know when.
[12:19.46]Just use your common sense.
[12:21.60]Okay, so that's all I can do, by the way.
[12:23.98]I have no other controls.
[12:24.82]I have no other moves.
[12:26.66]Go back to Briscoe.
[12:27.86]There, he's right here.
[12:30.27]Can I, like, stop recording?
[12:31.95]Why would I be on the job doing this?
[12:33.53]Who's that?
[12:34.03]Oh, it's you.
[12:34.47]Okay.
[12:34.79]Nice to meet you, too.
[12:35.99]This is all I do.
[12:36.51]This is the whole game.
[12:37.47]Okay, fine.
[12:51.47]But there isn't a whole lot of time, you know.
[12:53.89]Don't be late for the take.
[12:56.27]It can be tough out here on location.
[12:59.35]We've got to work as a team.
[13:01.01]I just rammed her.
[13:03.35]Don't mind Briscoe.
[13:04.59]He's always like that.
[13:06.00]Okay.
[13:06.98]He's a really dependable guy, though.
[13:09.30]This is an empty, empty fucking world.
[13:10.78]He'll be a big help to us both.
[13:13.48]Oh, one more thing.
[13:14.90]Make sure you get my guts out.
[13:16.26]As a cameraman, getting scoops is important.
[13:19.76]But it's not the only thing, in my opinion.
[13:23.34]For example... So that's a focus point.
[13:26.08]If somebody right in front of you needs help, or if there's some kind of emergency...
[13:32.34]I think you should stop shooting and help them.
[13:34.66]Okay, so an emergent... What?
[13:38.26]Of course, that's just my own personal opinion.
[13:43.41]What's going on?
[13:43.97]Some of the movie scenes it is possible to stop shooting by pressing the triangle button.
[13:48.96]What the fuck just happened?
[13:49.94]What?
[13:50.18]Hold it.
[13:50.50]They load a cutscene for you to do a quick time event.
[13:54.12]I'm gonna trip over that board.
[13:55.44]I don't even know the board was there.
[13:57.00]Well, I wanted the scoop.
[13:58.04]I wanted to get the scoop on her.
[13:59.38]That wasn't cool.
[14:18.00]Okay, let's head back to the news van.
[14:19.60]At... Okay.
[14:29.32]8-7-7-4-17 AM.
[14:32.01]Foggy.
[14:34.87]Lake Michigan.
[14:35.83]The game is called Welcome to Lake Michigan or something, whatever it is.
[14:40.67]Evacuating the city of Chicago.
[14:43.19]In Michigan.
[14:43.89]On the lake.
[14:44.33]There's no official word yet.
[14:45.37]On the fog's cause.
[14:46.25]There's fog everywhere.
[14:47.17]Okay.
[14:51.79]Amala Martell?
[14:56.29]This is just the movie Nightcrawler.
[15:03.04]So wait, this is the fake sound engineer in the game.
[15:06.10]Okay.
[15:07.70]Like I understand.
[15:12.42]So what's the scoop?
[15:13.86]Why is this just like Mickey Mouse Clubhouse?
[15:16.34]I feel like this is a children's show.
[15:18.42]Okay, time to make Pamela look good.
[15:19.74]Alright, this is a cutscene, I'm not in control.
[15:37.54]Oh, you got some real wrinkles on your mouth there, Pamela.
[15:39.96]She has like that emoji face.
[15:41.73]Alright, let's go.
[15:42.09]I'm not even in control.
[15:42.75]Just pretend I'm controlling this.
[15:44.01]Uh oh.
[15:44.21]Yeah, good zooming.
[15:44.79]Should I press triangle?
[16:10.34]First triangle to help.
[16:11.28]Triangle.
[16:31.40]what are you doing run what is what how did we not see that coming up behind her how did we not see that that doesn't make any sense uh lady you might want to watch out for the giant frog that's coming behind you what's happening just calm down did I not press triangle in time what was that thing calm down Pamela calm down
[16:55.79]That was a lot of syllables for what she just said.
[16:58.80]I'm just silent.
[16:59.50]Right, you brought me here to film.
[17:00.74]She's like, triangle?
[17:01.50]Triangle, right?
[17:02.30]Triangle doesn't do anything.
[17:03.40]It's going to rip her head off.
[17:05.32]Why am I just standing there watching this?
[17:31.20]Why would we let that happen?
[17:34.56]Save the current... Did I lose the game?
[17:40.87]Suspense.
[17:41.43]Immoral 120.
[17:42.47]Erotic.
[17:43.01]I have no idea what the fuck just happened.
[17:51.16]But I guess that was the beginning of the game.
[17:59.76]He had to get the scoop.
[18:00.58]Okay, ZakaTV team, wait.
[18:07.70]Is it redoing what we just did?
[18:09.74]No.
[18:10.24]This is 8.23, 7.45 AM.
[18:12.74]Received information on a possible survivor in the Chicago International Hotel downtown.
[18:18.94]Why is this just like law and order?
[18:22.31]Like, dun dun, arrived at the international field.
[18:27.10]Filling in for Pamela Martell.
[18:28.54]News reporter Anne Anderson.
[18:31.20]Well, this is a definitely I'm-gonna-die name.
[18:35.57]That is a please-kill-me name in a horror movie I've ever seen.
[18:38.55]Some gruesome incident had occurred.
[18:44.01]I'm gonna sneeze.
[18:48.89]Oh, so I get... I don't have control.
[18:52.71]Okay, I think maybe I do now.
[18:56.33]Alright, here we go.
[18:56.95]Alright, so we got... I got control now.
[18:58.55]We got stuff on the table.
[19:01.13]Apples.
[19:01.39]Should I film the apples?
[19:04.39]The fruit is starting to rot.
[19:05.99]Okay.
[19:08.53]What else should I do?
[19:10.99]This guy... There's evidence on the ground.
[19:12.83]This guy really likes to film everything.
[19:15.39]33 minutes of tape.
[19:18.13]And what have you done?
[19:19.97]What am I looking at here?
[19:22.47]Okay.
[19:24.15]Okay.
[19:26.27]There's a blood stain here.
[19:28.29]It must have been a really gruesome incident.
[19:34.84]Where's my sound guy?
[19:35.74]Is he still here?
[19:36.30]I don't know where the hell he is.
[19:41.80]Who?
[19:42.02]Did I do this?
[19:43.36]Oh, that's interesting.
[19:44.40]That's a person.
[19:49.48]Who the hell are you?
[19:51.26]Find anybody in that room?
[19:53.76]Nobody in this room either.
[19:56.26]What a bloody mess, huh?
[19:58.80]Looks like it.
[19:59.98]Alright.
[20:01.00]Let's give up here.
[20:03.52]There isn't anybody left in the whole hotel.
[20:06.24]She's definitely... This is just film people die.
[20:10.00]Briscoe went downstairs a long time ago.
[20:12.99]And anyway, the other teams are getting the jump on us.
[20:16.61]What if I run out of battery?
[20:17.65]Does the game end?
[20:18.07]We don't have time to waste hanging around here.
[20:21.27]We've got to get out there and find something.
[20:23.39]Okay, well...
[20:25.62]Hold the telephone.
[20:26.52]Film the telephone.
[20:27.38]Telephone!
[20:28.94]Could it be Driscoll?
[20:32.06]I do love how sometimes it just goes like slow motion for like five seconds.
[20:39.09]I gotta film.
[20:39.83]Something's gonna happen to her.
[20:40.53]Hello?
[20:48.13]Hello?
[20:49.41]What am I supposed to... Why am I so useless?
[20:51.44]I can hear you.
[20:51.96]Calm down.
[20:53.38]Slow down.
[20:58.61]I'm focusing on her, okay.
[20:59.71]I'm sorry, I just bumped you.
[21:04.15]Wait, that's a time limit in the corner.
[21:05.49]That's a giant pancake telephone.
[21:06.41]I gotta get the scoop on the bed.
[21:27.98]What's that?
[21:28.86]I can't zoom in.
[21:29.46]This is so... I wish I wasn't this useless.
[21:32.02]I'm gonna be more erotic?
[21:37.02]What does that mean?
[21:37.76]Am I doing it right?
[21:38.32]Holy shit, this is the worst.
[21:54.66]This is like I just got in to the office.
[21:57.62]I'm not even an actress.
[22:00.76]You just handed me a piece of paper and I read it with my glasses on.
[22:03.19]Alright, so now what do we... Let's go to the center building.
[22:05.91]Okay.
[22:06.01]Yeah.
[22:06.11]It looks like she...
[22:24.08]Okay, let's hurry.
[22:31.35]Let's hurry.
[22:37.25]That's never not going to be funny.
[22:39.31]It really isn't.
[22:40.91]Alright.
[22:42.71]Now what?
[22:44.21]Center building.
[22:44.81]So are we going this way?
[22:50.40]Do I have to like...
[22:53.89]What does the cursor do?
[22:57.57]Do I have to point the camera at shit?
[22:59.05]I'm going to run out of tape.
[23:03.77]No, alright.
[23:07.49]Why do I get crosshair when the X doesn't do anything?
[23:10.29]Alright, I'm just going to say we have to go over here.
[23:16.06]Oh, there you are.
[23:17.12]Sorry, I'm just wasting tape.
[23:19.40]Not a big deal.
[23:25.03]Okay, I just looked at the door and she opened it.
[23:28.42]X button to go through.
[23:29.48]Triangle to go back.
[23:30.28]Okay, go in.
[23:31.38]Is she in here with me?
[23:36.54]Okay.
[23:36.70]We're going to get some slow motion here, I think.
[23:52.46]So I can't do anything about that.
[23:53.60]I can just follow her around.
[24:00.06]Oh, wait, we had a Halloween store giggle.
[24:02.02]I heard it.
[24:08.19]This is like, I feel like this is the most useless character in any video game.
[24:17.09]What's the goal?
[24:20.54]I just am focusing on the reporter.
[24:22.14]There's gonna be a monster in here.
[24:24.28]Then I'm gonna film it.
[24:26.40]Alright, where is it?
[24:26.94]Sure, anything you say.
[24:30.74]Okay.
[24:42.01]The scoop indicator at the top of the screen shows what kind of scoops you have been focusing your attention on.
[24:46.16]The E indicates erotic.
[24:48.64]The S indicates suspense.
[24:50.28]Okay, I get it.
[24:52.28]So, it's just a real-time indicator.
[24:54.60]So, what do I have?
[24:55.82]So, I have mostly suspense points.
[25:01.32]So, that's what the top means.
[25:02.56]I can't move.
[25:03.06]Alright, now we're running.
[25:10.24]I'm going to keep her in frame, though.
[25:14.74]Who's on the piano?
[25:16.88]We're really losing speed.
[25:18.78]I'm in a fucking nightmare, dude.
[25:26.96]Oh, there he is.
[25:31.28]There's Brisco.
[25:32.06]Oh, man.
[25:48.26]I'm in a dream.
[25:49.48]I can't play this song.
[25:51.76]I'm actually in a dream.
[25:52.86]No.
[25:53.63]No.
[26:00.07]No.
[26:01.31]Is there something wrong?
[26:02.43]How do I wake him up?
[26:14.01]Do I need to do something?
[26:15.67]I just let Pamela die.
[26:17.99]No, I just have to let them talk.
[26:19.03]I still can't believe it.
[26:23.17]It's the NyQuil.
[26:25.85]Did it really happen?
[26:29.17]What kind of a way to die was that?
[26:32.33]Oh, by the way, this is not slowed down.
[26:34.05]When am I going to tell her parents?
[26:36.31]He's actually... Actually, I can't tell anymore.
[26:41.36]I can't tell anymore.
[26:45.26]I know.
[26:46.81]I'll tell him.
[26:48.05]Is it lagging or is that for real?
[26:51.41]That was a fine reporter and a brave one.
[26:55.26]That's just real.
[26:57.26]She threw herself into a rock.
[27:01.81]Yeah.
[27:04.27]Pamela was pretty brave, wasn't she?
[27:06.47]I think it's a combination of both.
[27:10.27]I loved her.
[27:12.39]God.
[27:13.55]I was crazy about Pamela.
[27:17.53]I need a better shot than this.
[27:18.59]Why is she up to... Damn it!
[27:22.93]Yeah?
[27:23.27]Didn't even get a chance to say goodbye.
[27:27.54]Well, now you have a chance to... Wait, can I focus?
[27:30.10]What am I focusing on?
[27:30.74]His shoes?
[27:31.84]No.
[27:32.38]Risco, I understand how you feel.
[27:35.97]Remember?
[27:37.95]Pamela and I started together.
[27:40.45]We were always friendly rivals.
[27:44.53]This game is too much.
[27:47.24]I wish it didn't happen either.
[27:49.62]But, you know... How have I had this much suspense?
[27:53.60]Danger is what this job's all about.
[27:56.12]After all...
[27:58.34]Pamela knew the danger she faced.
[28:02.36]And I won't let Pamela die in vain.
[28:03.83]Turn around.
[28:05.99]That's why.
[28:06.97]There's nothing here.
[28:09.05]That's why we've got to keep going for her.
[28:11.49]There's nothing there.
[28:14.11]Let's go out there and capture the truth.
[28:17.11]Briscoe, come on.
[28:18.35]Dangerous.
[28:19.89]We can't do it without you.
[28:30.18]I can't get over this.
[28:31.39]Yeah.
[28:33.37]Yeah.
[28:34.75]I guess you're right.
[28:37.81]I'm sorry.
[28:38.61]I'm like ruining this.
[28:40.77]Turn around.
[28:41.53]I did just turn around.
[28:44.59]Oh, man.
[28:45.83]There's nothing here.
[28:52.29]Okay, can we fucking leave?
[28:54.69]Oh, there is a skip button.
[28:58.61]I'm not sure I want to skip, though.
[29:00.27]Alright, we're going to get him water.
[29:04.37]Here comes a slow motion run.
[29:06.87]Well, maybe not.
[29:09.56]Alright, water.
[29:12.98]There's a focal point right here.
[29:17.24]Hold on, what was that?
[29:21.36]Just my imagination.
[29:22.80]What was your imagination?
[29:25.22]What are you talking about?
[29:26.10]Where are you going?
[29:32.28]I tried this earlier and I wasn't doing this.
[29:36.78]Just skip the whole game?
[29:37.92]No, I need to know.
[29:44.93]Now what?
[29:45.25]There isn't anybody here.
[29:47.03]Alright, well there's nobody here.
[29:50.75]I'm gonna need water though.
[29:52.06]I'm gonna go to the fridge.
[29:53.46]Refrigerator.
[29:54.76]There's water right here.
[29:56.16]I found it.
[29:57.88]Come get it.
[29:59.36]Is it water?
[30:03.20]So come get it.
[30:08.09]Water.
[30:12.03]What?
[30:12.41]Do I not talk?
[30:15.32]Why am I a dog?
[30:17.36]Oh, a spider.
[30:20.58]You've got to ram and save her.
[30:25.28]Okay, I'm gonna ram her!
[30:26.91]I'm gonna get her!
[30:28.05]I'm queuing it up!
[30:34.23]Did I film it?
[30:35.79]Did I film the spider?
[30:46.02]Where is it going?
[30:54.24]Okay, go get the water now.
[30:56.23]Now that we got rid of the... I didn't get any... Go get it.
[30:59.11]There.
[31:04.95]Water.
[31:07.63]On the ground.
[31:08.01]See it?
[31:09.21]Pick it up.
[31:09.65]I thought that was her laughing.
[31:15.94]Am I pressing a slow motion button?
[31:17.80]No, I'm not.
[31:19.58]I don't know why it's doing this.
[31:32.22]I swear to you.
[31:37.84]That wasn't... I tested it.
[31:39.58]It wasn't doing this before.
[31:47.41]I don't want to fix it, but I also don't... Ugh, goddammit.
[32:00.75]No, this is emulated, because you can only get this on Japanese PlayStation.
[32:06.07]It's not on NTSC PlayStation.
[32:12.06]I have to import a PS2 to play this one.
[32:20.32]I didn't know that.
[32:28.38]Why is it in English?
[32:29.08]Because this released in Europe.
[32:36.40]What just happened?
[32:37.62]Oh.
[32:40.15]I'm gonna have to press a button.
[32:44.58]Alright, let's go for the monster.
[32:56.19]Running into mon- The reporter always has their gun handy, so focus on incoming monsters to get the reporter to fire at them?
[33:04.48]What?
[33:04.66]I don't understand.
[33:09.52]Get the reporter to fire at the monsters?
[33:12.51]So I have to point and tell her where to shoot.
[33:14.57]Alright, um... What?
[33:17.49]Where are they again?
[33:19.63]Right there.
[33:20.05]Okay.
[33:21.05]Fire!
[33:25.39]Oh boy, this is gonna be hard.
[33:28.13]Are you serious?
[33:28.95]Okay.
[33:31.97]Uh... Shoot that one.
[33:36.27]Get it!
[33:37.13]Get it!
[33:42.45]We have a trio of people who aim and fire.
[33:47.82]She's holding that weapon really strangely, too.
[33:52.38]Can I, like, walk over here?
[33:53.30]Okay, there's another one.
[33:54.26]Are these... What are these, spiders?
[33:55.97]Good shot.
[33:58.69]Alright, do it again.
[34:03.47]This is the dumbest thing ever.
[34:07.40]I just have to look at it.
[34:10.14]Look, I found one.
[34:10.84]I'm the spotter.
[34:11.54]Okay.
[34:16.36]Good shot.
[34:18.87]Another one.
[34:19.51]Watch out.
[34:20.05]Watch out for the weird... Aurora Borealis.
[34:22.65]What's this thing from Resident Evil?
[34:25.77]Hey, you did it.
[34:34.22]I really might need to take a second to figure out what the fuck is going on.
[34:37.36]Hold on.
[34:37.60]Hold on.
[34:38.32]I'm going to pause the game.
[34:39.86]No, I'm not going to pause the game.
[35:06.88]Keep it?
[35:08.30]We'll keep it for a little while longer, and then I think I have to change the process affinity.
[35:14.95]Check out, we found Truby's van.
[35:18.89]Keep it?
[35:19.53]Alright, we'll keep it.
[35:25.99]We didn't see anybody around the van, though.
[35:27.34]More details later.
[35:32.85]Yeah, I'm the moron that didn't realize this was a PAL only.
[35:35.37]And I couldn't put it in... I can't do it in my PlayStation, so I had to emulate it.
[35:43.66]Can I... Can I have the gun?
[35:45.78]I have no erotic points.
[35:52.16]How?
[35:52.72]Okay.
[35:55.12]Another cutscene.
[36:00.49]I can't move this.
[36:02.22]It's on its own.
[36:04.80]Yeah, I did say erotic points.
[36:20.75]Are you okay, Pamela?
[36:22.23]I'm sorry I didn't save you before.
[36:23.79]But it couldn't be helped.
[36:24.73]She's still alive.
[36:25.27]That thing was eating you.
[36:27.52]There was nothing we could do.
[36:28.86]I can't believe you're still alive.
[36:31.26]She's definitely gonna be a monster.
[36:32.24]Her thing's gonna come out of her mouth and it's gonna grab the guy like a scorpion could over here.
[36:37.67]Told you.
[36:38.01]What's the matter?
[36:39.05]Are you alright?
[36:39.75]Come here!
[36:41.21]Oh my god!
[36:41.49]Are you alright?
[36:43.75]Get over here!
[36:56.92]You idiot!
[36:58.00]Now she's going to turn into one of those things.
[37:05.71]Alright, that's kind of scary.
[37:10.93]Funny, I feel like I've been shit-faced before and I've done that to get to the bathroom.
[37:15.16]Is that weird?
[37:17.74]Wait, now we're going to get control?
[37:20.64]Zero erotic points.
[37:21.90]Whatever.
[37:23.30]Save over it.
[37:33.63]Monster!
[37:35.99]Monster!
[37:38.95]Alright.
[37:40.61]We're going this way.
[37:42.51]This game's only like three hours long, guys, by the way, so I think we have to see the whole thing.
[37:46.23]It was.
[37:49.13]Easy, Briscoe.
[38:02.76]anyway let's hide out here for the time being four hours with the slow motion alright so how do I get like points how do I get the e points it's not working they're broken we can't get out this way
[38:25.56]So we can't get out this way.
[38:27.60]I'm the brains, apparently.
[38:29.88]So we have to go the other direction.
[38:32.40]Wait, what am I looking at?
[38:35.64]Try that door.
[38:39.66]Okay.
[38:41.38]Let's go on in.
[38:47.30]Music is just playing now.
[38:48.72]Scary music.
[38:49.48]Monster in here.
[38:57.24]Is he about to punch her?
[38:58.58]Oh my god.
[39:00.38]I was like, wait, why are you doing that?
[39:02.13]He was just, like, prepping a haymaker.
[39:04.71]Oh shit, there's a monster in here?
[39:06.59]Smash!
[39:07.41]Alright, so now what?
[39:25.16]Somebody use the printer.
[39:28.63]I don't know, because it gave me an indicator.
[39:34.27]Okay, anything on the desk?
[39:36.77]Computer?
[39:37.39]Email?
[39:37.71]AOL?
[39:37.87]No, you've got mail.
[39:38.69]Porn?
[39:38.87]It's definitely like porn or something, right?
[39:43.60]Isn't it?
[39:48.30]I have no idea.
[39:50.00]Honestly, I'm going to be real with you.
[39:51.82]That looks like the Smash Bros.
[39:53.34]Melee game case.
[39:57.27]Could be.
[39:58.33]Right?
[39:59.59]Those of you guys that have Smash Bros.
[40:01.01]Melee at your house, hold it away from you and squint your eyes.
[40:06.37]That game wasn't even out yet.
[40:08.87]What's this one?
[40:11.11]I don't know.
[40:18.14]Pikmin?
[40:18.56]No.
[40:19.24]This is PlayStation.
[40:19.84]This is PlayStation, not Nintendo.
[40:21.10]Alright, this is the focal point.
[40:22.86]I gotta find whatever we need to focus on here.
[40:25.68]A door.
[40:26.24]Go open it.
[40:26.98]Let the reporter take care of doors.
[40:28.58]Because I'm too much of a fucking child to do it, apparently.
[40:33.31]Alright, we'll get over there and do it.
[40:35.67]Newspaper.
[40:36.21]It's a third-rate gossip rag.
[40:41.29]X-rated criminal.
[40:42.07]What is that?
[40:42.55]X-rated.
[40:42.95]What?
[40:43.15]D or D.
[40:47.56]I think we'd better be careful.
[40:48.50]It looks like we're being watched.
[40:52.21]I'll try to lie low for a while, too.
[40:54.49]From M. What's with the crosshair?
[41:02.43]Alright, can you get over here and open up a door or something?
[41:11.74]Open that door.
[41:13.84]Let the reporter take care of the doors.
[41:15.00]Yeah, we'll get over here and open it.
[41:22.02]Come on, honey, open the door!
[41:22.96]The reporter needs to take care of the doors, so take care of it!
[41:27.66]Am I gonna ram the door?
[41:29.84]Oh, that just hurt my head.
[41:33.47]Alright, can I ram?
[41:35.85]Oh, man!
[41:36.51]Oh, man, oh, man.
[41:38.41]I'm sorry, but you weren't listening.
[41:40.13]So now, go over there.
[41:46.13]Ram her towards the door.
[41:48.33]I like that idea.
[41:54.51]Alright, you're getting there.
[41:55.23]You're almost there.
[41:56.56]One more nudge and you should be there.
[42:02.18]No, get the door.
[42:02.74]Door, door, door, door.
[42:03.80]Door, door.
[42:07.58]Got it.
[42:08.26]No.
[42:08.74]Shit.
[42:09.02]There's something in the room that I have to do.
[42:12.20]There has to be something I have to focus on.
[42:14.90]Something I missed.
[42:16.44]Telephone or crayons.
[42:18.00]If you're reading this note, you'd be wise to leave here at once.
[42:23.51]Before something terrible happens.
[42:28.08]Okay.
[42:30.76]Books.
[42:31.26]Shelf.
[42:34.00]Coffee.
[42:35.06]Coffee!
[42:36.42]Their coffee looks great.
[42:37.30]It'd be nice to take a break right about now.
[42:40.27]What?
[42:40.45]More notes.
[42:42.19]Enter office memo.
[42:52.74]Attention, please ensure the key is replaced at its original position.
[42:55.14]Alright, reporter.
[42:59.48]Maybe we shouldn't be in here.
[43:01.50]What if I look at this door?
[43:03.30]Let the reporter take care of doors.
[43:07.05]Yeah, I need to get her attention.
[43:08.51]She needs to go over there.
[43:10.37]How do I get your attention?
[43:12.99]Hey.
[43:13.65]Should I go?
[43:15.67]Hey, you.
[43:15.99]Excuse me.
[43:23.99]Hello?
[43:25.97]I mean, she's looking over here.
[43:28.92]So you have to assume there's something like over here I need to look at.
[43:34.30]Got it.
[43:35.30]There's a key.
[43:38.40]Well, that was pain in the ass.
[43:41.04]Oh, quick.
[43:44.13]Oh, quick.
[43:44.63]Oh, damn it.
[43:45.03]I missed the opportunity.
[43:45.77]Huh?
[43:46.69]Huh?
[43:51.01]Oh.
[43:52.11]I'm going to assume the key is for this door over here.
[43:55.05]Give it a try.
[43:58.74]Mm-hmm.
[43:59.08]Go on.
[44:01.26]Oh, shit.
[44:02.26]Really?
[44:02.80]Ah, ah, ah.
[44:03.34]There we go.
[44:04.96]Now she figured it out.
[44:06.18]I feel like I'm playing The Sims.
[44:09.56]Like, I have to go to the bathroom.
[44:16.99]No, you're going to work.
[44:19.33]You're going to work and you're going to pee at your desk.
[44:21.39]That's what's going to happen.
[44:24.23]But I want to play basketball.
[44:26.43]What?
[44:27.27]What's going on?
[44:27.65]The door opened all by itself.
[44:31.41]No, I want to go lift the weights that are in the house for like seven hours.
[44:36.78]No, no, you're going to work.
[44:39.04]Alright.
[44:39.72]Maybe we should be careful here.
[44:40.68]Watch out.
[44:42.66]What does it say?
[44:49.18]Quick, erotic!
[44:56.86]What was a dead body doing in there?
[44:58.80]That was really delayed.
[45:01.11]You better be getting this on tape.
[45:03.57]I bet.
[45:04.95]She tried to get away, but couldn't.
[45:08.51]We'd better go before the same thing happens to us.
[45:11.63]This game.
[45:12.69]Let's get out of here.
[45:17.75]He's dead.
[45:19.03]Okay.
[45:19.67]I think he's going to get up.
[45:20.41]Poor thing.
[45:22.69]I knew it.
[45:23.03]He's getting up.
[45:26.21]What's going on?
[45:26.77]What's happening?
[45:29.62]I thought he was going to get up or something.
[45:30.94]That was weird.
[45:32.90]Alright.
[45:33.12]So we need to get out of here.
[45:34.08]Let's get out of here.
[45:40.58]Watch out.
[45:41.89]Oh, I knew it.
[45:42.53]I knew it.
[45:42.99]No, I thought.
[45:43.69]Wait a minute.
[45:44.29]Wait, wait, wait.
[45:44.83]Is there anything in this room?
[45:47.70]Look at the other containers.
[45:50.92]Nothing?
[45:52.06]Just making sure I don't miss anything.
[45:56.06]I just got a text from Verizon.
[46:01.03]Free Verizon message.
[46:02.09]Join Verizon.
[46:03.89]Start earning rewards.
[46:05.27]It's fast, isn't it?
[46:05.91]Are you serious?
[46:08.09]I just got an ad from Verizon as a text?
[46:13.97]RIP the erotic ending.
[46:16.27]Well, that's too bad.
[46:18.29]Alright, now I think we just have to leave.
[46:22.27]We're taking a strange route to get there, but that's fine.
[46:32.48]Alright, out this door.
[46:36.06]Open it!
[46:36.82]How do you know that?
[46:47.94]How would he know the monster?
[46:48.66]What do you mean the monster?
[46:51.60]Oh boy, okay.
[46:53.06]I'm ready.
[46:57.72]Huh?
[47:05.75]Pamela?
[47:06.53]Oh, shoot it!
[47:07.63]Shoot it!
[47:10.45]Shoot it again!
[47:14.52]Good shot.
[47:14.96]One more.
[47:15.26]Another shot?
[47:19.51]I don't know how many more of these you need.
[47:20.69]Shoot it again.
[47:24.05]Okay.
[47:25.05]Shoot it again.
[47:25.61]Okay.
[47:27.88]We might need to run away.
[47:28.78]I think we need to run.
[47:29.92]That is fucked up.
[47:31.40]That's not... I don't know what to do.
[47:33.08]No!
[47:50.46]Should we run?
[47:51.22]I think you and I need to probably find a way out of here at this point.
[48:03.93]Should we save the team login data?
[48:08.23]I guess so.
[48:14.26]Shove him into the mob.
[48:15.66]I think that was supposed to happen.
[48:22.68]Crazy scene.
[48:25.70]Was that supposed to happen?
[48:28.62]DACA TV team log.
[48:32.50]823... No, that's supposed to happen.
[48:37.31]We went to the center building to look for the survivor and cover the story.
[48:43.07]But reporter Ann Anderson met with a sudden accident.
[48:47.33]Interesting.
[48:49.22]I'm afraid she's dead.
[48:51.60]Afraid she is, yeah.
[48:55.51]Feeling our own lives are in danger, too.
[48:57.15]We decided to go back to the office to regroup.
[49:03.93]Okay, so let's regroup here.
[49:06.19]We're here.
[49:06.80]Mm-hmm.
[49:14.68]Man, it sure is quiet.
[49:18.72]There's another character.
[49:19.74]Hey, look, a new character to die.
[49:21.36]Maybe everybody evacuated already?
[49:24.06]Hi, I'm the new character.
[49:25.52]That would be us.
[49:27.42]So, I'm gonna shove the person out.
[49:29.30]Carly?
[49:29.44]Mhm.
[49:29.58]Woah, people!
[49:50.19]So next time a monster shows up, I'm going to just smash into them?
[49:57.24]Push them out of the way?
[49:57.98]Save Doug.
[50:01.82]Whoops-a-daisy.
[50:02.20]Okay, so I guess we're going to follow Carly.
[50:18.00]What was that?
[50:19.22]Oh, there's a mouse.
[50:19.81]There's a mouse monster in here.
[50:23.31]Where'd everybody go?
[50:24.87]Where did she go?
[50:25.59]What the fuck just happened?
[50:26.67]Where did she go?
[50:29.57]Where is she?
[50:29.97]I have no idea.
[50:35.11]There was like a mouse sound and then she's gone.
[50:38.45]The shelves are lined with data from past shows.
[50:42.85]Lone Gunman 2 starring the Balboa Brothers.
[50:46.89]Okay.
[50:51.74]I have no idea.
[50:55.51]Well, hold on.
[50:57.63]This can be moved, it seems.
[51:00.71]Ah, it's a secret door or something.
[51:02.21]Secret entrance.
[51:05.11]What is this?
[51:08.11]The Zaka TV staff yearbook.
[51:12.59]Yeah, there it is.
[51:15.35]Look at this picture of you!
[51:16.77]Oh, that's so funny.
[51:18.39]You look weird.
[51:20.75]You're weird.
[51:21.13]And this girl.
[51:25.32]Take a look.
[51:26.26]Hey, there's Pamela's picture.
[51:32.26]She's so beautiful.
[51:34.74]What are we looking at?
[51:36.30]We're pretending that we're looking at this.
[51:39.21]Look, she's smiling.
[51:42.29]You know, she always looked her best when she was smiling.
[51:48.19]He's reading it with his mind.
[51:57.67]That's some Wiseau quality acting.
[52:01.17]I'm getting a lot of suspense points.
[52:04.27]Should I, like, film as... There's too much suspense.
[52:07.86]I need to pull back some eroticism here.
[52:11.82]Okay, well... Sorry to hear about that, but we need to find out where the hell that lady just went.
[52:22.87]Out here?
[52:23.21]I should go down?
[52:24.43]I'm gonna get jumpscared in a second, I know it.
[52:32.34]Seems to be locked.
[52:33.22]We need to find another damn key on the ground.
[52:35.30]Is that what you're telling me?
[52:36.06]I really don't want to find another ground key.
[52:44.91]Here?
[52:46.83]No, that can't be opened.
[52:49.97]No, that can't be opened.
[52:51.37]It's going to have to be on the ground in that room, right?
[52:54.89]Elevators can't be used.
[52:59.78]It's got to be in the ground.
[53:02.18]Okay, hold on.
[53:04.44]I just had a target.
[53:07.16]Something in here.
[53:09.56]What's that sound?
[53:10.12]Okay, he's going to die in here.
[53:14.46]What?
[53:14.66]What?
[53:22.83]Oh, wow.
[53:24.84]That's awful.
[53:27.02]What happened?
[53:28.32]Both Pamela and Anne were really dedicated to their work.
[53:33.02]Okay, so what do we need to do this for?
[53:36.70]Do you have a key?
[53:41.20]Well, I guess you want to open this door, so go ahead and open it.
[53:46.70]We're so dead in here.
[53:47.78]There's nobody here.
[53:50.75]Where'd everybody go?
[53:53.51]Good question.
[53:56.77]Laptop.
[53:58.03]Yeah.
[53:58.57]Well, they appear to be some kind of news notes.
[54:00.28]Maybe they were left by one of the... Went to the site of the crash, but it was all very strange.
[54:04.42]The army was acting pretty jumpy, too.
[54:06.00]Alright, look for another ground key.
[54:11.88]Let the reporter take care of the door.
[54:13.08]This is... She's a reporter?
[54:14.26]Dude, we're going through reporters like nothing.
[54:21.27]Some kind of note.
[54:22.15]It's not very clear.
[54:24.22]It says, Gagney.
[54:28.36]What?
[54:28.64]Hello?
[54:35.56]Why does she keep leaving?
[54:37.12]Oh, no, there she is.
[54:37.68]Alright, open that door.
[54:41.80]Maybe somebody's in the back room?
[54:43.90]God, we're going to get another guy.
[54:45.48]I'm going to fall out of a desk.
[54:48.27]No sign of anybody here either.
[54:55.21]I'm gonna note... You can't move very fast when you're squatting if you want to move... I couldn't even read it.
[55:04.56]What do you mean squatting?
[55:08.70]How do you squat?
[55:12.35]I just found out how to just zoom in normally.
[55:14.43]Okay.
[55:17.13]Okay.
[55:18.96]Hey, that's the telephone.
[55:22.96]No shit.
[55:24.40]This guy is a brainless idiot.
[55:26.31]Alright, pick it up.
[55:30.59]Zaka TV, may I help you?
[55:34.93]Hello?
[55:38.41]Yes.
[55:41.39]We're all in the same room.
[55:42.33]Why can we not hear this?
[55:45.47]Okay, don't worry.
[55:48.24]Why was that muffled for us?
[55:49.12]Just calm down and speak slowly, okay?
[55:57.21]Me?
[55:57.47]He's speaking a different language, the only she can understand.
[56:03.39]Yes, that's right.
[56:04.29]From the evening news.
[56:08.57]You do?
[56:09.73]Well, thank you.
[56:10.53]That's me?
[56:14.05]Yes.
[56:20.19]Yes, there's definitely an evacuation advisory.
[56:26.04]I see.
[56:27.98]You can't get out of bed?
[56:30.26]Where are you?
[56:31.08]Okay, I understand.
[56:37.21]I'll be right over.
[56:38.03]She's talking to Elvis.
[56:40.85]Who was it?
[56:44.09]It was an elderly gentleman in a nursing home.
[56:50.19]It sounds like he's been left behind there.
[56:54.68]We're gonna go rescue him.
[56:56.86]That was perfect.
[56:57.68]Well, of course.
[56:58.50]No way!
[57:02.18]I've had enough danger for one day.
[57:05.20]Thank you very much.
[57:06.70]Whoever said that, that was perfect.
[57:08.53]But he's been left behind and he's elderly.
[57:11.35]Oh, he's elderly.
[57:13.31]He's been left behind.
[57:14.25]Let the police or rescue services take care of it.
[57:17.17]Ugh.
[57:18.23]It's not our job.
[57:19.87]I hope we go there and he's still talking like that.
[57:21.53]But those services aren't running anymore.
[57:24.65]That's why he phoned us.
[57:27.47]Well, what else do you suggest?
[57:29.18]How do I get ironic points?
[57:31.60]There's an elderly gentleman up there who needs help.
[57:35.18]We can't just ignore him.
[57:37.86]By the way... You just want a good story, that's all.
[57:41.95]I'm such a fucking weirdo, man.
[57:43.55]This is like a zombie apocalypse.
[57:46.31]And all I care about is like, yeah, just to keep talking.
[57:48.47]That's suspenseful.
[57:50.17]Nope, okay, let's go.
[57:58.30]Uh, so we're gonna be quiet now.
[58:00.14]Nothing else to talk about, I guess.
[58:05.54]You decided to go?
[58:07.54]Thank you, Mr. Briscoe.
[58:09.54]That's not me, that's the guy behind me, and he's taking all the credit.
[58:14.46]But I'm warning you, it's dangerous out there!
[58:17.77]Take this!
[58:23.23]I still have no erotic points.
[58:26.91]Okay, immoral 100.
[58:28.73]32 fucking hundred suspense points.
[58:34.24]How is... How am I getting so many suspense points?
[58:39.24]I'm just going to stop filming when people are talking.
[58:41.91]I'm going to point at the ceiling.
[58:45.65]We need more immoral and we need a few more erotic to balance ourselves out.
[58:49.91]It's like the four humors, you know what I mean?
[58:51.61]You got phlegm, blood, platelets, and gas, right?
[58:57.75]Whatever it is.
[58:59.09]So it's the four humors.
[59:00.21]So now we need erotic, immoral, suspenseful, and I don't know what the fourth one is.
[59:09.87]The state goes by very slowly.
[59:11.73]We went back to the office to regroup and ran into reporter Carly Rae there.
[59:20.32]We got a phone call that said an old man had been left behind at the Brody nursing home.
[59:33.66]Can we give like a gold medal to the person that said that in the chat?
[59:36.95]That was fucking hysterical.
[59:40.60]I can't get over.
[59:42.25]Why does he keep giving him credits?
[59:43.91]I know who he is.
[59:52.91]Okay.
[59:53.59]Good evening, everybody.
[59:55.23]This is Carly Reese.
[59:57.41]Our news team received a telephone call.
[59:59.19]How is this suspenseful?
[60:00.99]It seems an old man has been left behind at a nursing home.
[60:03.95]Like, I don't... Here we are now at the Broody Nursing Home.
[60:09.33]Okay.
[60:09.55]Just about to begin searching the inside of the facility for the elderly gentleman.
[60:13.55]Alright, let's go.
[60:15.79]Is somebody there?
[60:18.01]Help!
[60:19.19]Somebody's calling for help.
[60:20.17]Let's go.
[60:20.61]Please help me!
[60:22.96]Over here!
[60:23.92]Alright, go investigate.
[60:27.00]Over there?
[60:27.78]I can't move.
[60:28.86]Give me control of the character.
[60:30.94]Give me control of my character.
[60:34.75]Justine!
[60:35.71]A new character.
[60:36.79]Carly?
[60:38.22]And Briscoe, too?
[60:39.54]What the fuck?
[60:40.12]Came to save me?
[60:41.04]Alright.
[60:41.98]Immoral.
[60:42.36]Justine, what on Earth happened?
[60:44.36]How do I get immoral?
[60:45.18]Forget this to you.
[60:45.94]I don't know.
[60:47.62]I have no idea.
[60:50.00]Try Ram?
[60:51.82]I was at the office when somebody suddenly attacked me from behind and knocked me out.
[60:56.89]When I came to, I was here like this.
[61:00.79]Okay.
[61:00.91]So how do we get her out?
[61:01.95]Ram the desk.
[61:02.35]So I'm fucking free.
[61:03.05]Well... You can't just slip out of there.
[61:05.27]If you take off your shoe, you can definitely get out of there.
[61:32.08]It looks like there aren't even enough balls to play nine ball.
[61:35.36]Hmm, interesting.
[61:36.20]Yes, that's odd, isn't it?
[61:38.08]Let's go look for the missing balls.
[61:41.05]So we're going to put the balls in there and then it's going to unlock because it's a weird fucked up lock mechanism where the crazy guy decided he was going to have this impossible puzzle where nobody could ever figure it out.
[61:55.37]You need to put the balls in a certain alignment.
[61:59.58]And then it'll unlock her bonds.
[62:02.02]And no one will ever do it, especially considering I have the code on a door that's right behind her.
[62:08.53]You'll never figure it out, bitch.
[62:10.47]Alright, we're going.
[62:15.13]Let's go, let's go.
[62:16.25]Get him, pick him up.
[62:19.83]Get that one.
[62:20.79]It's the nine ball.
[62:25.93]Three more What's behind door number two alright find the other pool balls I'm gonna assume probably got a couple of paintings to look at oh
[62:51.02]Come on, get out of there.
[62:52.96]There's too much fog.
[62:54.10]I don't like the fog.
[62:55.42]What is this, PlayStation 2?
[62:58.96]Some kind of note.
[63:00.12]Somebody's brushing their teeth behind me.
[63:01.48]It's no use.
[63:02.07]Guns won't work against that thing.
[63:04.27]Huh?
[63:04.57]Huh?
[63:04.95]Huh?
[63:05.41]Huh?
[63:05.89]What?
[63:07.87]What's going on?
[63:17.23]The sink?
[63:18.21]Who's making that noise?
[63:21.18]Ah!
[63:21.38]Whoa!
[63:21.66]Whoa!
[63:21.92]Whoa!
[63:22.14]Okay, that was me swinging accidentally.
[63:23.70]Okay.
[63:25.19]In the fridge.
[63:29.51]Dude, I can't even see anything.
[63:31.01]Is somebody in there?
[63:37.32]What the fuck is that?
[63:40.24]There's something in there.
[63:42.30]I can't tell what it is.
[63:51.00]Were those like naked people or something?
[63:53.80]Was that naked people?
[63:55.82]I can't even tell.
[63:56.68]This whole room is a fog light.
[64:04.34]Okay, there she is.
[64:07.82]What have you got?
[64:08.24]What's the scoop?
[64:13.94]Is this door open?
[64:16.14]It does.
[64:25.60]Going in?
[64:27.06]It's no use.
[64:29.52]It won't open.
[64:30.84]Okay.
[64:35.44]I bet there's something important in there.
[64:37.60]There's something about the fog that's making it run like shit.
[64:46.45]The ram didn't work.
[64:53.99]Follow me.
[65:00.25]Let the reporter take care of the doors.
[65:02.37]You have to make them do something first.
[65:03.75]They have to get out of the way.
[65:05.85]They have to figure it out.
[65:11.72]So, it won't open.
[65:12.48]You sure?
[65:13.92]There's nothing you can do about it?
[65:17.32]There's nothing you can do about this.
[65:21.10]Whoops.
[65:22.84]Ouch!
[65:24.70]I'm sorry.
[65:25.82]I'm sorry!
[65:26.63]You're a real jerk.
[65:29.47]What about this door?
[65:30.27]Can you open this one?
[65:36.35]Is she up yet?
[65:41.03]Open that one.
[65:45.04]Did I get erotic points for that?
[65:46.50]How?
[65:49.30]Alright, come on in.
[65:54.02]What's that?
[65:54.60]Guy on the ground.
[65:55.22]Watch out!
[65:59.88]Is that an apple or is that... There's another dead body here.
[66:06.00]Did the monsters come here too, I wonder?
[66:08.32]The poor man.
[66:11.88]It's gonna bite her hand.
[66:12.90]Hey!
[66:14.26]Look!
[66:15.32]There's a ball!
[66:16.68]Is this guy naked?
[66:17.40]It's the seven ball!
[66:18.72]Oh, I guess he's not.
[66:21.70]Just two more, huh?
[66:23.61]Alright, well what about this?
[66:24.31]Probably something in this room that I need to grab.
[66:26.45]Right?
[66:26.93]Like a key to get in the other door.
[66:38.27]Nothing?
[66:41.18]That's it.
[66:41.54]I guess I have to... She's probably gonna... She's gonna move... She's gonna go to the other doors.
[66:52.70]I never thought people speaking slightly slower than normal could be so funny.
[66:58.22]I could probably fix it, but if we don't want to fix it, then that's on us.
[67:06.57]I'm actually positive I could fix it.
[67:10.53]There's one more after this.
[67:18.74]Makes the game more unsettling, but that's probably a good thing because it's a horror game.
[67:24.15]Go on in.
[67:29.39]Well, alright.
[67:33.25]Bathtub, bloody bathtub.
[67:38.03]Alright, just go digging around in there, see if you can find it.
[67:40.63]That water sure is a nasty color.
[67:44.87]I wonder if there's anything in it.
[67:46.51]Yeah, there's definitely a ball in there.
[67:47.67]Why don't I try pulling the plug?
[67:51.84]Well, you thought about it, and it happened.
[67:55.08]Wow!
[67:56.20]Another ball!
[67:57.38]It's just one ball!
[68:00.02]Just one more left to go.
[68:02.13]Alright.
[68:06.97]It's a big toilet.
[68:07.91]How do you sit on this?
[68:11.52]I feel like if I sat on that, I would go in the toilet.
[68:14.57]Wouldn't be good.
[68:15.43]Alright, uh, pizza?
[68:16.79]No, it's a sink.
[68:31.03]Well, this is really slowing down now.
[68:33.69]Must be loading some assets in the background.
[68:36.47]Hey!
[68:38.98]Doesn't this wall look a little too new here?
[68:43.52]Does it?
[68:44.56]So push it.
[68:45.16]I can't tell.
[68:48.18]Go on, push her open.
[68:48.86]Well, it looks pretty suspicious to me.
[68:53.85]I betcha there's something behind it.
[68:56.23]Like another ball!
[68:57.19]If we could just find a tool to break it down.
[69:01.38]Oh, a tool.
[69:02.32]Let's go find some tools.
[69:03.48]Hmm, maybe over here?
[69:07.01]Come on, reporter.
[69:08.01]Open the door.
[69:30.14]Come back in with a sledgehammer and smash the thing and throw it.
[69:34.46]What?
[69:34.88]Talk.
[69:36.54]Hey, look!
[69:40.52]I don't like the way that chandelier is swaying.
[69:44.40]Oh, here we go.
[69:45.04]Oh my goodness.
[69:48.24]What's wrong with that?
[69:48.84]If it does fall, it'll crash right onto Justine.
[69:52.03]Oh, that's going to fall on top of her.
[69:54.33]Oh my, let's hurry.
[69:58.87]Well, let's hurry.
[70:01.23]Not much time.
[70:02.17]We have to save Justine.
[70:13.10]Last ball and then we have to solve the puzzle.
[70:15.64]There it is.
[70:16.06]There's a tool in there.
[70:16.90]Open that toolbox.
[70:18.00]Get the tool.
[70:22.04]It would be useless to take it with you.
[70:24.09]What?
[70:28.27]What are you talking about?
[70:30.44]Don't we need a tool?
[70:33.52]Nice children's recital trumpet players.
[70:36.68]Like, you're still learning, obviously.
[70:38.62]You're still in education to learn.
[70:41.63]So, there was no reason to come in here.
[70:43.13]Turn it on.
[71:01.00]Did you just hear a strange noise?
[71:05.55]It came from inside the armoire!
[71:07.89]It's gonna break out and in slow motion kill somebody.
[71:12.53]Oh, God.
[71:18.69]The sound came from inside this.
[71:20.09]Oh, she's dead.
[71:20.85]This is it.
[71:22.47]Say goodbye to her.
[71:26.27]The sound came from inside this thing.
[71:32.60]Here we go There's a child Bloody handprints and an electric chair.
[71:42.85]Oh
[72:05.12]Okay.
[72:11.22]Oh, there's the ball.
[72:20.66]What's a room doing behind a door?
[72:22.38]Alright, let's go solve the puzzle and get out of the lag room.
[72:27.68]Great!
[72:29.42]That's all of them.
[72:33.53]Great Now we got it.
[72:35.99]We got to get out of here because we need to go save Jennifer or whatever her name is Get out of the way Open it Quickly back downstairs
[73:02.51]Alright, solve the puzzle.
[73:05.35]We have... How much time do we have?
[73:07.09]The chandelier's gonna drop.
[73:08.99]Alright, so come over here.
[73:13.05]Put them back in here.
[73:17.38]Oh fuck, I didn't even look.
[73:19.56]I gotta go look at the... Shit, I gotta go look at the thing.
[73:28.02]That's not correct, but I gotta go look at the thing.
[73:33.51]Oh, no.
[73:35.41]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[73:36.27]That's gonna fall on her.
[73:38.29]Wait, what the fuck?
[73:39.29]I got it right?
[73:39.91]I didn't get that right, did I?
[73:44.17]I got it right.
[73:44.83]Are you fucking serious?
[73:49.65]Did we make it?
[74:05.42]alright we're fine that's unbelievable I can't believe it I'm alright I can get up by myself thank you very much for helping me you're welcome but I'm the one that saved you I'm the one that has the 700 trillion iq to put them in the right places at the right time and just on intuition alone
[74:38.24]Thank goodness you're safe now, Justine.
[74:41.74]But... But what?
[74:45.34]We didn't find that elderly gentleman.
[74:47.52]The one that called us asking for help.
[74:50.88]I didn't think there was anybody here.
[74:52.62]If you're wondering why I'm doing this.
[74:55.76]Everyone's probably wondering, why the fuck is he doing this?
[74:59.00]I'm trying to balance out the points.
[75:00.87]But there should be an old man here somewhere.
[75:04.83]Don't film this.
[75:05.33]I don't want suspense points.
[75:06.89]Let's listen to it.
[75:09.38]Old creepy pervert.
[75:10.48]No, I just need to aim at the ground.
[75:35.78]But I guess you're right.
[75:38.74]I guess we'd better get out of here.
[75:40.42]No, the old guy's gonna show up here in a second.
[75:41.94]Great.
[75:43.97]I'm all for getting out of here.
[75:48.27]Justine, you wait here until we make sure it's safe, okay?
[75:52.65]She's dead.
[75:53.45]Okay, fine.
[75:55.07]By the way, why wouldn't you use this as a weapon?
[75:56.85]Mr. Briscoe, let's go look for an escape route.
[75:59.53]And just start kendo-sticking people, you know what I mean?
[76:01.87]Like, why would you even keep the boom around?
[76:04.11]It's survival time.
[76:06.66]Alright, so now, where are we gonna go?
[76:08.58]Are we gonna get out of here?
[76:14.02]What's the scenario now?
[76:15.78]I only got 21 minutes before the world ends.
[76:19.65]And the bees take over the world.
[76:23.75]Wasn't that in that game?
[76:25.93]72 hours before the bees take over?
[76:27.31]No, we already were in here.
[76:32.78]Um...
[76:35.96]What is this like?
[76:37.72]Hold on.
[76:41.51]Nothing on the ground?
[76:42.49]Is that a knife?
[77:09.44]Look.
[77:10.10]Okay.
[77:10.76]There's something on the floor.
[77:13.04]It's a key.
[77:15.62]That was very... Look, that was stealth.
[77:17.52]That was stealthily there underneath the two music notes.
[77:20.95]I wonder what door it opens.
[77:23.57]Come on.
[77:23.83]Give me a break.
[77:24.47]It was underneath the fucking music notes.
[77:26.97]That's Beethoven's Fourth Symphony right there, guys.
[77:29.11]Sorry I couldn't see the key.
[77:30.89]Oh, fuck.
[77:31.39]Where did she go?
[77:31.84]Okay.
[77:34.12]We're fine.
[77:43.05]Oh.
[77:43.39]My.
[77:43.91]God.
[77:44.27]I don't know if I want to go in here.
[77:49.27]Do I want to go in this?
[77:53.73]Ah.
[78:06.43]This music doesn't fit.
[78:07.41]Oh!
[78:09.33]Move!
[78:09.79]Move out of the way!
[78:13.54]I saved her!
[78:18.36]What do I do about this?
[78:19.08]What do I do?
[78:19.56]Is there a gun?
[78:23.50]Do you have a gun?
[78:26.28]Don't stop going over here!
[78:27.90]Get out of the way!
[78:29.56]Don't get in the way of his fucking skewer!
[78:32.37]Oh my god, I see I saved her life.
[78:34.09]Okay, what's in here?
[78:34.73]What's in here?
[78:35.11]Over here, come on!
[78:38.39]Oh shit!
[78:47.33]No, you get out of the way too.
[78:48.47]You're gonna get skewed.
[78:51.17]Am I a monster?
[78:52.20]That didn't do anything.
[79:00.72]Oh, they don't even care that this is here.
[79:02.42]You need to move out of the way now.
[79:06.05]Can we leave this room?
[79:09.43]Oh my god.
[79:16.43]behind gas don't oh she's dead shoot it shoot try something else the gun doesn't work can we just leave out out of the room the gun doesn't work use something else but I don't know what else is here
[79:43.89]Shoot the gas.
[79:45.99]Shoot the gas tank.
[79:50.78]Shoot Briscoe.
[79:51.78]No.
[79:52.10]I need to keep getting her out of the way.
[79:54.38]She's gonna get skewered.
[79:58.30]Oh, she's dead.
[80:01.69]Okay.
[80:02.15]Where?
[80:03.03]Right there?
[80:04.65]Got it.
[80:04.99]Gas.
[80:22.46]Shoot the gas up there.
[80:24.10]That's gas, right?
[80:25.85]Looks like it.
[80:28.05]Shoot it!
[80:32.11]Good job!
[80:34.61]Um... Are we gonna explode?
[80:43.44]No?
[80:43.62]Shoot him?
[80:48.12]I shot the gas, now shoot the guy?
[80:49.90]She keeps getting hit.
[80:57.64]Okay, now shoot him.
[81:01.75]Shoot the light.
[81:03.33]Shoot the lamp.
[81:05.55]That would make sense, wouldn't it?
[81:07.77]Shoot the lamp!
[81:08.61]Alright, blow it up!
[81:18.56]Okay, we need to get like immoral oh Shit, that's a penis
[81:48.72]Is it?
[81:50.95]Shit, I don't know.
[81:54.93]Okay, well, that's not good.
[81:57.59]That's not good.
[81:58.36]Okay, well, let's... Let's just move on from that.
[82:05.90]Good job, you killed the monster.
[82:07.11]Now what?
[82:16.71]over here this the garage garage door we can get out through here pickaxe where's this pickaxe you speak up okay I'm coming I don't think I can alright let's get out of here where do you want to go
[82:38.78]I wonder if the others at the office are okay.
[82:42.24]There isn't anybody at the office anymore.
[82:45.00]The chief told everybody to go home.
[82:48.48]I stayed and saw everybody else off personally.
[82:50.99]I bet that they're all with the families now and that they've already escaped the city.
[82:55.29]We ought to escape too!
[82:59.55]I'm worried about my family.
[83:02.49]They might still be here in Chicago looking for me.
[83:06.41]At least we have everybody.
[83:08.51]The whole party's here.
[83:10.13]We've got a full Final Fantasy party here.
[83:11.15]Four people?
[83:11.53]No, is it three or four?
[83:12.15]Yeah.
[83:27.28]They might still be here in the city, don't you think?
[83:30.70]I need to like film all the fucked up shit to get points, right?
[83:33.28]This is like pretty fucked up.
[83:34.36]Son of a... Are you serious?
[83:38.88]I know where Kristen's team is anyway.
[83:41.68]He got word there was a monster in the old Miller family mansion.
[83:45.47]He took his team over there to cover the story.
[83:48.01]The Miller mansion?
[83:50.37]Mr. Briscoe, we should go there too.
[83:53.13]This is not the end of the game.
[83:54.03]The game is apparently like... This guy.
[83:56.57]It's apparently like a three to four hour game.
[84:02.45]And if we're already here, we might as well try to see it.
[84:05.76]If it's possible.
[84:07.92]Alright, we got immoral but no erotic.
[84:10.78]Much more immoral than suspenseful this time.
[84:18.02]I gotta pee so bad.
[84:20.25]Can I pee?
[84:21.49]Let me pee.
[84:22.03]I'm gonna pee.
[84:23.39]I'll be right back.
[84:24.09]Let me pee.
[84:25.91]Be right back.
[84:27.98]Pee time.
[84:29.30]See you in a second.
[85:21.65]Yeah.
[86:06.05]Wait, what?
[87:06.89]I didn't have the light on in here.
[87:10.32]I was gonna say darkness, but that's not even true.
[87:14.58]That would have been a complete fabrication.
[87:20.34]Alright, let's get back to it.
[87:21.38]Thank you for your patience as I go to the bathroom.
[87:26.35]And there we go.
[87:30.57]G. Face scan for one minute.
[87:35.44]No, I don't have any clothes on.
[87:40.27]I'm turning into like a fat fuck man.
[87:43.11]I popped a button on my shorts.
[87:44.61]This is the first time it's ever happened.
[87:49.20]I zipped up these pants and, like, it popped out.
[87:52.03]And my stomach just kind of hung over.
[87:53.49]It's not even true.
[87:54.57]It's a lie.
[87:55.21]This is Carly Reese.
[87:57.19]Chicago seems to have turned into a virtual city of death.
[88:02.19]Our news team has gotten word that some of our colleagues may have been left behind in this mansion.
[88:09.03]We're just about to enter the mansion to see what's happened to them.
[88:11.43]It's like robots trying to pass the Turing test.
[88:13.17]Let's go in now.
[88:14.21]Is that what it sounds like?
[88:21.79]Let's go team up with them.
[88:31.87]Oh, that's right off the bat.
[88:33.08]Okay, that's right off the bat.
[88:34.86]Monster right off the bat.
[88:37.84]It's not a person.
[88:38.64]You can't say freeze.
[88:39.56]Oh, no.
[88:39.96]Is there?
[88:40.48]No shit, huh?
[88:49.61]It's not moving.
[88:51.15]I bet it would if we got too close.
[88:54.49]Alright, so don't go near the weird shrimp.
[88:57.59]Man, that thing looks brutal.
[89:00.81]It does look pretty creepy.
[89:02.77]You wouldn't stand a chance against it.
[89:06.75]Make sure you stay back.
[89:08.57]Why don't we just throw rocks at it?
[89:10.18]Alright.
[89:11.66]Just pick up kitchen utensils and throw it at the stupid bugs from Men in Black.
[89:18.25]Okay, um, so now what?
[89:23.83]We decided to go team up with them.
[89:28.17]D or D?
[89:30.71]How are things going with you?
[89:31.61]No new developments on this end, really, either.
[89:34.29]But apparently this fog didn't spring up by chance.
[89:36.31]I'll keep looking into it.
[89:38.73]From M. Okay.
[89:42.05]This is going to be some Raccoon City bullshit.
[89:46.39]That's apparently some you-got-an-achievement-or-you-figured-something-out noise.
[89:55.88]Does that mean I'm filming something interesting?
[90:19.56]On the emu- the emulation?
[90:20.74]Yeah.
[90:21.32]Like, let- let- let- Alright, we- we- we had our fun.
[90:24.72]Now let's fix the emulation.
[90:25.96]You know what I'm saying?
[90:29.10]Hold on a second.
[90:29.58]Let me see if I can get this- Let me see if I can fix this.
[90:37.48]So it's not going insane.
[90:47.19]Let me see here.
[90:53.89]Hold on.
[90:55.49]I didn't fix true crime.
[91:00.47]But I don't think true crime was actually having any problems.
[91:07.83]Hold on.
[91:08.41]Let me see what this does.
[91:19.87]Let me do that.
[91:21.41]How does this look now?
[91:29.90]You are the problem.
[91:31.44]I don't know if that's going to do anything.
[91:41.85]I can do this, though.
[91:43.81]Watch this break my computer.
[91:46.21]My whole computer is going down.
[91:51.80]Two times on this game might be interesting.
[91:56.58]I'm not so sure about that.
[92:00.22]Where are we at here?
[92:03.88]Where are you?
[92:04.62]There you are.
[92:05.24]OK.
[92:07.58]OK.
[92:08.32]There it is.
[92:12.41]Now, how do I change this?
[92:20.59]I forgot how dumb Windows 10 actually is when you try to change shit like this.
[92:31.91]Uh... Oh, fuck you Windows 10, you suck.
[92:40.92]Okay, there we go.
[92:44.60]Alright, let's see what happens.
[92:49.68]Did I get, did I fix anything?
[92:51.90]And here we go.
[92:54.24]And... How we doing?
[93:02.49]Oh, shit.
[93:04.63]Oh!
[93:08.51]I think it actually is better.
[93:10.33]But it screwed up, so hold on.
[93:12.43]I need to open it back up again.
[93:19.92]I do think that did help, though.
[93:26.34]Can you see it?
[93:29.34]Fuck.
[93:31.74]Fuck!
[93:33.55]No!
[93:36.68]Did I really just blow it?
[93:40.32]I may have just blown it.
[93:41.10]Hold on.
[93:45.66]It's alright, we had it saved right there.
[93:52.55]Alright, hold on.
[93:53.21]I fucking broke it.
[94:05.99]No, it's not the streaming software.
[94:07.41]I, like, actually just fucked it up.
[94:10.36]Fuck me.
[94:10.86]Alright, hopefully this works.
[94:17.28]Is it gonna work?
[94:20.26]Come on, don't do this to me.
[94:21.83]Come on.
[94:22.77]Ah!
[94:23.35]Ah, ah, ah.
[94:24.37]There it is.
[94:27.05]Except that's all fucked.
[94:27.93]Why is that fucked?
[94:28.47]Why is it doing that?
[94:30.51]Why are you like this now?
[94:36.41]What the fuck?
[94:39.84]Okay, and we're back.
[94:42.60]Except this is not, this is, this is not the right resolution.
[94:53.67]Yeah, this is in fact completely incorrect.
[94:56.65]Hey, well we lost, we lost resolution, but I think we gained frames.
[95:11.50]Alright, we're good.
[95:12.38]Let's see.
[95:13.22]I think it should be fixed now.
[95:24.02]Don't worry, I'm just going to stretch it.
[95:27.26]Yeah, this is where we just left it.
[95:37.05]Yeah, found the nursing home guy.
[95:38.09]Good evening, viewers.
[95:39.79]This is Carly Reese.
[95:41.81]Chicago seems to have turned into a virtual city of death.
[95:46.59]Our news team has gotten word that some of our colleagues may have been left behind in this mansion.
[95:53.23]We're just about to enter the mansion to see what's happened to them.
[95:59.64]Yeah, we didn't even get any frames either.
[96:03.44]Why the fuck would this be region locked?
[96:06.58]There's a monster right in front of us.
[96:14.37]It's alright.
[96:17.71]It's not moving.
[96:19.19]I bet it would if we got too close.
[96:23.89]It's like even worse.
[96:26.21]Man, that thing looks brutal.
[96:30.62]Fuck.
[96:32.44]We wouldn't stand a chance against it.
[96:36.60]Hold on, let me see if I can... Uh, it's actually... I'm looking at the real-time data here.
[96:45.75]It's actually a little bit better than it was before.
[96:48.27]By about, like, 4%.
[96:56.32]It is actually better, but not by very much.
[96:58.72]Alright.
[97:00.34]Let the reporter take care of doors.
[97:01.91]Why not?
[97:06.09]Alright, so we can't go, we can't walk head on into that thing.
[97:15.55]Kitchen knife?
[97:16.11]We have to find a way to get past the monster, right?
[97:19.99]Oh, this thing's floating now.
[97:22.39]Somebody put a fucking Harry Potter spell on it.
[97:28.66]I think that was supposed to scare me.
[97:29.78]I think that was suspenseful.
[97:31.08]I think it felt like suspensefulness.
[97:33.54]Or something.
[97:39.80]okay so we can't we don't walk in front of the monster but we can go in this door whoa that was spooky yeah it actually has improved looks like the basement want to go down I don't think I dump the resolution by like I get claustrophobic in basement as you can see it's smaller but uh I think we can handle it it's gonna still gonna happen but it's not gonna be as bad
[98:08.98]Newspaper clipping from a week ago the headline says research director of Zaka bio labs fired Because before it was dropping down to like 50% and now it's dropping down to 70 There's a slight improvement
[98:38.69]We're going to have to dump gasoline on that guy again or something, right?
[98:47.81]What a clickbait title.
[98:52.93]It kind of was clickbait, wasn't it?
[98:55.27]50 to 70 equals 4%.
[99:05.16]Yeah.
[99:06.94]Well, I didn't even get to get a good sample.
[99:12.29]I didn't get a sample size.
[99:15.07]You want a sample size of your hair?
[99:16.89]Hold on.
[99:24.81]I think I've got a solution.
[99:30.58]What's the, um...
[99:34.60]What's that stupid resolution that's below 720?
[99:36.30]1024 by, like... What is that, like, piece of shit resolution that was, like, really good back in the day?
[99:47.49]1024 by what?
[99:49.05]Is, like, the biggest good resolution that was for computer monitors back in the day.
[99:54.39]960 by 480?
[99:57.41]1024 by 768.
[99:57.55]There it is.
[99:58.35]Let's see if that does anything.
[100:04.47]Oh, boy.
[100:05.45]Oh, boy!
[100:10.90]Solution?
[100:14.04]Feels a little bit better.
[100:18.83]By a little bit.
[100:23.49]Well, whatever.
[100:23.93]Let's just play it.
[100:25.45]What are we looking for here?
[100:30.89]The normalest red.
[100:31.91]Yeah, that... No, actually, I can't play like this.
[100:34.03]This is too small.
[100:36.13]This shit's too small for my feeble fucking brain.
[100:42.98]I need more screen.
[100:48.26]Alright, that's good.
[100:51.46]Out the window.
[100:51.92]What am I looking at here?
[100:58.73]Step ladder?
[100:59.17]It's a step ladder.
[101:01.79]So why don't you move it and jump?
[101:06.80]Oh, yeah.
[101:07.24]Well, there's a key up there.
[101:09.26]Good thing I saw that.
[101:10.12]Did you not just see... Get on that.
[101:11.26]This actually is Dora the Explorer.
[101:30.09]How can we get on top to see the armoire?
[101:33.41]Do you know how to do that?
[101:38.21]Right.
[101:40.93]You arbitrarily pointed at the screen.
[101:43.20]I got it.
[101:45.02]It's a key.
[101:45.44]And we're brainwashing you to think that you have control of the show.
[101:55.81]How about this door?
[101:57.59]Try it.
[102:03.46]Is this going to be on top of the spider monster there?
[102:06.25]Alright.
[102:21.31]I'm following her.
[102:23.29]She seems to know where she's going.
[102:28.73]Ah, slow down.
[102:31.38]Slow down!
[102:33.38]I hear monsters.
[102:34.78]Alright, we'll get in.
[102:44.44]Is she just walking in a circle?
[102:46.22]No, she... Okay, there's a shotgun in here.
[102:49.84]Good find.
[102:50.76]Oh, that key.
[102:51.92]How many stairways are there in this house?
[103:00.27]Too many.
[103:04.69]That's a huge gun.
[103:10.79]That is very large.
[103:12.15]That's way too big of a weapon.
[103:14.77]She's gonna shoot this and she's gonna fly across the room.
[103:22.34]Okay, so shoot the monster with the shotgun.
[103:24.88]What are you doing?
[103:35.15]I know you want to be a hero here, but you're going to have to be very careful.
[103:37.65]Alright, I've got to get a good shot here.
[103:39.65]I've got to get a good camera angle.
[103:45.72]Alright.
[103:46.52]Take aim.
[103:47.12]Hit it.
[103:49.80]I'm not doing a good job with the camera because I can't move.
[103:58.26]That's a good shot right there.
[103:59.46]Good shot.
[104:00.19]Thumbnail.
[104:08.18]Did I get it?
[104:10.02]That was awesome.
[104:13.09]So much for that actually working.
[104:17.03]And a aim.
[104:20.27]Damn.
[104:24.47]Looks like we're out of bullets.
[104:28.25]I love it.
[104:30.16]It makes the game more endearing.
[104:31.52]It kind of does.
[104:32.28]Oh, well.
[104:35.24]That monster's in heaven.
[104:37.73]Monsters don't go to heaven.
[104:38.77]They go straight to hell.
[104:39.85]There you go.
[104:43.54]Extra point.
[104:54.94]If you don't have any more bullets, alright.
[104:56.02]I was going to say, go get another one.
[104:57.03]There's like 10 guns in there.
[104:58.81]I'm going to make it a giant picture of this huge, ugly mosquito thing.
[105:05.39]Alright.
[105:08.50]Okay.
[105:11.72]Close up.
[105:12.68]Ah, shit.
[105:13.46]That's just mosquito dick.
[105:15.46]Ah, I'm gonna get banned.
[105:16.32]Ah, let's go.
[105:22.97]My emulator's dying.
[105:24.35]I know, it really is.
[105:25.81]But it's been dying the whole time.
[105:28.91]We'll be alright.
[105:47.61]Keep her in frame.
[105:48.71]Do a good job.
[105:51.53]How about this door?
[105:52.44]Open that one.
[105:53.04]See what's in there.
[105:54.38]A dead body, maybe?
[105:55.64]A mystery?
[105:56.68]A couple of clues?
[105:57.98]That doorknob is in a... That's not a right door.
[106:01.78]This door's incorrect.
[106:05.55]That's not where a doorknob is, right?
[106:09.43]Those doorknobs are glued on.
[106:17.30]Can I speed up the emulator?
[106:18.92]I can't.
[106:20.84]I don't think I can.
[106:26.55]Just because you don't like the reporter, that doesn't give you the license to... Oh, he's sick.
[106:36.21]He's gonna throw up a monster out of his mouth.
[106:39.56]You heard it here first.
[106:45.38]He's gonna hurl out one of those slugs.
[106:48.11]And then we're all gonna die.
[106:55.46]Bathtub.
[106:57.16]Toilet.
[106:58.10]Bathtub.
[106:59.94]Pull the plug.
[107:00.80]Maybe there's a key.
[107:04.36]Nobody coughs unless something is wrong.
[107:07.83]Maybe we'll find something if we pull the plug.
[107:10.61]You already played this card.
[107:11.77]Come on, really?
[107:15.01]No, nothing.
[107:17.91]So that was just, that was worthless.
[107:32.10]A poop joke?
[107:32.96]No, there's no poop joke.
[107:34.12]Come on.
[107:38.41]I mean, if there was like a big log in that toilet though, that would be sort of funny.
[107:43.69]I don't know if I would laugh at something like that, because my style of humor is not like that, but I may have chuckled.
[107:49.93]Different brand of humor, you know?
[107:56.21]This door doesn't open, right?
[107:57.25]Maybe it does.
[107:58.27]Maybe it doesn't open.
[107:59.83]Okay, so when you drain the bathtub, you can open the door.
[108:04.04]Interesting.
[108:04.40]Uh-oh.
[108:14.64]Uh-oh.
[108:19.36]Oh, shit.
[108:22.04]I gotta stop filming this, man.
[108:23.36]I'm gonna get in trouble.
[108:27.33]I'm not gonna make that joke again.
[108:28.71]It's clearly a peg leg.
[108:34.75]Is that still alive?
[108:38.11]What?
[108:41.97]Carly, is that you?
[108:46.02]What are you doing here?
[108:49.42]Yes, it's me.
[108:51.92]We came to rescue you.
[108:52.68]Wait, I gotta get a good shot of this.
[108:54.63]How do I crouch?
[108:55.61]Hang on now, sir.
[108:56.79]Oh, whoops.
[109:01.91]I... I...
[109:04.74]I was a fool.
[109:05.96]Good shot.
[109:06.90]That's cinematography.
[109:07.64]Let my whole team get killed.
[109:10.08]No, get back.
[109:10.76]What kind of director am I anyway?
[109:13.74]There you go.
[109:14.08]That's Crouch.
[109:15.65]Oh, Mr. Henning.
[109:17.43]Now that's cinematography.
[109:18.87]It wasn't your fault.
[109:22.07]It's all too strange.
[109:26.43]What's happening here in Chicago and what Zaka is doing too.
[109:33.19]Good shot.
[109:33.65]By the way, he's got shaky hands, don't we?
[109:38.04]This guy sucks as a cameraman.
[109:41.74]I hope he pukes in her face.
[109:42.78]I get it out of the video.
[109:43.66]Could you do me a favor?
[110:03.59]Tell my wife something for me.
[110:06.39]I'm going someplace.
[110:08.59]No, come on.
[110:09.54]Far away to do a story.
[110:12.42]Get some erotic points?
[110:14.66]And I won't be back.
[110:17.34]Tell her it's my lucky break.
[110:19.50]I don't know if that's... Biggest scoop of my life.
[110:27.16]Mr. Henny!
[110:28.64]I don't know if I'm getting any.
[110:34.18]What a shitty film.
[110:38.82]He's already dead.
[110:40.52]Alright, he's gone.
[110:42.42]Leave him be.
[110:43.56]Just download all of his laptop data.
[110:49.19]Come on!
[110:50.99]This game jumps around.
[110:58.03]The pacing in this game is very odd.
[111:01.79]I got 175 erotic?
[111:05.92]How?
[111:08.92]Did I do something erotic in there?
[111:13.70]Oh, I had the mosquito penis.
[111:14.94]That's right.
[111:15.32]I forgot.
[111:23.88]Rat foot.
[111:26.97]Here we go.
[111:28.99]Good evening, everyone.
[111:31.07]This is Carly Reese.
[111:33.35]I'm afraid I can't seem to find the proper words to describe to you the current state of affairs.
[111:40.15]We've all lost so many things.
[111:43.55]Chicago is in a horrible state of tragedy.
[111:49.00]We're here at St.
[111:50.20]Matthew's Church, but we've all but given up hope.
[111:55.60]Zaka TV viewers, this may be my last report.
[112:02.04]Yeah, we're gonna get another reporter after this.
[112:04.72]The reporters just have infinite lives.
[112:06.40]They just keep giving them to you.
[112:07.34]I'm gonna sneeze and it's gonna be... Okay, we're good.
[112:18.71]So that thing, we're gonna get an image of that.
[112:20.99]Now that thing is actually torn apart.
[112:29.39]There's something moving up there ahead.
[112:31.29]Uh-oh, what is it?
[112:34.21]I don't see anything moving.
[112:38.03]Jeff!
[112:38.23]Jeff!
[112:39.03]Where are you?
[112:40.19]Jeff, is that you, Jeff?
[112:43.54]It's me!
[112:43.88]It's Carly!
[112:46.40]Jeff, which one of you is Jeff?
[112:50.66]Oh, no!
[112:52.64]I think that's Jeff.
[112:54.46]Is that Jeff?
[112:56.08]I don't know.
[112:57.44]Which one of them is Jeff?
[113:03.06]Oh, there he is.
[113:18.44]Well, okay.
[113:25.78]Pre-recorded stream joke?
[113:27.58]What?
[113:32.39]Okay, what do we do?
[113:37.97]He's kind of just dancing.
[113:40.15]Do we have any guns?
[113:50.25]I couldn't do anything to save her.
[114:01.37]What are we supposed to have done here?
[114:15.94]I did shove her!
[114:23.24]They're eating her!
[114:24.92]And then they're going to eat me!
[114:27.49]Oh my god!
[114:31.68]That fucking movie.
[114:38.52]Well, let's pick up a new reporter, I guess.
[114:47.73]We started out drop- Is there a car in the game?
[114:49.67]Because then it's plus a full letter grade.
[114:54.08]Briscoe ended up crashing the van.
[114:55.60]The van was totaled.
[114:57.40]We were lucky to be alive.
[114:58.50]Why did he crash?
[115:01.46]Turns out he didn't have a license.
[115:02.98]And he has a fourth grade education.
[115:06.88]After walking aimlessly in the mountains?
[115:18.03]There's the lodge.
[115:20.69]We're tired.
[115:22.23]We'd better rest there a while.
[115:25.64]sorry about this if I hadn't crashed the van it could have been at headquarters by now yeah you shouldn't have crashed the van I almost had a battery so now we have to go to the lodge which one this one look
[115:47.57]Right at the front door.
[115:49.79]It's going to be a new reporter.
[115:51.75]They're going to stand up and have a microphone.
[115:56.26]And we get a new reporter.
[115:58.32]Come on, I want to zoom in.
[116:11.36]Doesn't look like a monster.
[116:14.04]Is it alive?
[116:15.75]Yeah.
[116:17.29]Uh, I think so.
[116:21.37]Are you a reporter?
[116:26.27]Are you two with Zaka TV?
[116:28.41]Yeah, I wonder who you are.
[116:29.35]What are you doing here?
[116:31.19]Did Dwight ask you to come?
[116:32.94]Sure.
[116:33.16]Let's just say yes.
[116:35.30]We had a little car crash.
[116:38.16]Yeah, this game just keeps introducing reporters for monsters to eat.
[116:40.85]Is the game supposed to be really campy?
[116:42.39]But I believe so, yes.
[117:10.00]The whole game is supposed to kind of be tongue-in-cheek, I believe.
[117:12.48]And this is also PlayStation 2, so it's a long time ago.
[117:20.86]How did you know we were a Zaka TV news team?
[117:24.98]Because that's a Zaka TV shirt.
[117:26.88]I'm just getting points.
[117:28.42]Dwight works for Zaka TV, so I recognized it.
[117:30.82]Huh?
[117:33.92]By Dwight, do you mean Dwight Murdoch?
[117:37.69]Yes, that's right.
[117:39.30]Do you know him?
[117:40.90]Of course I do.
[117:43.24]You wouldn't?
[117:43.66]I'm crouching.
[117:45.08]Alright.
[117:45.42]No, I'm done with that.
[117:46.40]I don't care about exotic points.
[117:49.59]He never told me he had such a cute girlfriend, though.
[117:54.07]My name's Nina.
[117:55.67]Nice to meet you.
[117:57.29]The name's Briscoe.
[117:59.01]And what about you?
[118:01.26]You never put down a camera, do you?
[118:04.40]That gets to be a habit with TV cameramen.
[118:09.93]But you probably know all about it.
[118:11.89]Oh, somebody got Chinese food!
[118:16.45]Nice!
[118:18.77]So, why did you come here?
[118:21.85]Didn't you think you should evacuate?
[118:26.27]I heard the evacuation advisory after Dwight had already gone out to cover the story.
[118:31.77]He called me from where he was.
[118:33.13]There we go.
[118:34.33]Good cinematographer.
[118:35.09]We couldn't make it back to our apartment, so we agreed to meet halfway here at this lodge.
[118:40.40]And so here I am.
[118:42.70]Why were you passed out?
[118:45.18]Did you get attacked?
[118:46.96]I don't know.
[118:48.34]Maybe.
[118:50.56]The question is, who attacked you?
[118:53.58]Perfect fucking pan.
[118:54.76]If he's hanging around here when everybody else is evacuating.
[118:57.94]You don't think I fucking was trained in this shit?
[119:00.19]He must be up to no good.
[119:03.99]Doing something he didn't want anybody to see.
[119:06.55]I was trained in analog camera work.
[119:08.67]You showed up.
[119:11.07]I bet he hit you over the head with a blunt instrument.
[119:15.22]So where is this guy now?
[119:17.72]He's probably still somewhere nearby.
[119:24.82]Calm down.
[119:26.36]Just thunder.
[119:27.60]There's nothing to worry about, Nina.
[119:29.42]You never heard lightning or thunder before in your life?
[119:32.55]It's starting to rain.
[119:33.49]I mean, that was kind of scary.
[119:36.47]You think this guy is nearby?
[119:37.91]I don't know.
[119:40.01]Because that is sort of odd.
[119:43.45]We're here with you now.
[119:45.35]That's true.
[119:47.60]Too much suspense.
[119:49.20]Too much suspense.
[119:49.98]I need something to hide.
[119:53.26]I mean, Chinese food is not suspenseful, right?
[119:56.76]It's delicious.
[119:57.36]Hydrate.
[120:02.69]I already am.
[120:03.87]Damn!
[120:07.67]So we're cut off from the outside world, huh?
[120:11.69]By the way, Nina.
[120:12.79]Did you come here by car?
[120:16.06]Yes.
[120:16.62]I left it in the parking lot.
[120:19.30]Okay, good.
[120:21.32]Here's what we'll do then.
[120:23.80]We'll wait for Dwight until it stops raining.
[120:27.70]If he doesn't show up by then, we'll take off in your car.
[120:32.20]You won't do any good to hang around here.
[120:34.56]We can contact Dwight from the office anyway.
[120:38.88]Okay.
[120:39.86]That sounds reasonable.
[120:41.12]Let me drive, too.
[120:42.92]Until then, we should each take a room and relax and try to get our strength back.
[120:49.04]This guy's a killer.
[120:49.58]You must be tired, too, Nina.
[120:52.11]Why don't you take a shower or something?
[120:54.33]Oh, God.
[120:54.79]Don't even give me this opportunity.
[120:55.97]Yes, alright.
[120:56.65]But a guy with the camera... I guess I will.
[120:58.57]Oh, my God.
[120:59.63]Well, okay.
[121:02.95]Well...
[121:04.93]Alright, pick a room.
[121:05.63]I got a room now.
[121:06.77]Cool.
[121:07.93]I wonder what the game just told me and hinted at that I needed to go do.
[121:13.49]Maybe you should take a shower or something.
[121:16.45]Hey, isn't this game about walking around and filming things?
[121:21.98]Imagine if you could film that girl in the shower.
[121:25.92]Oh, I wouldn't fucking eat in here.
[121:27.60]I wouldn't take a shower in here.
[121:31.72]Wait, am I taking... What am I doing?
[121:34.20]Am I taking a shower?
[121:35.26]I don't... Man, that shower did me a world of... Oh, come on!
[121:48.14]Sounds like the rain stopped, too.
[121:50.84]Oh, please.
[121:53.24]I guess we'd better head out, then.
[121:55.82]Nina, could you go get the car from the lot?
[122:00.03]Sorry, but I want to rest a little bit more.
[122:03.13]I've ruined it.
[122:04.15]I feel a little dizzy.
[122:06.03]I just opened up a door.
[122:07.59]I'll be fine.
[122:10.44]I just need to rest.
[122:11.56]He isn't taking those headphones off.
[122:12.94]He's going to have raw ears.
[122:14.20]Are you sure?
[122:14.70]They're going to be sweaty and painful.
[122:17.38]Yeah.
[122:18.12]You'd better hurry, though.
[122:19.98]Alright.
[122:20.94]Let's go.
[122:21.32]Let's do it.
[122:22.26]Huh?
[122:24.56]Did you hear something upstairs just now?
[122:27.09]Let's go investigate.
[122:29.91]You go first.
[122:33.16]For somebody that is concerned, you sure are running very fast.
[122:37.46]Oh, a person!
[122:42.66]What?
[122:45.90]Is this Dwight?
[122:47.36]Is this the guy that we were talking about?
[122:48.54]He's crawling up.
[122:57.88]You're right.
[122:59.12]I'll go get the car.
[123:00.62]Let's go.
[123:01.08]That guy has no teeth.
[123:03.10]It's like a TV team vlog.
[123:09.82]8.43 p.m.
[123:14.57]Look, here's a shotgun.
[123:16.85]You might not know it to look at me, but I'm pretty good with a gun.
[123:20.09]As long as we have this, we can feel safe, huh?
[123:24.02]The campground's natural beauty almost made me forget the horrible things that happened.
[123:28.15]We're gonna go back, and he's... I think that the fatigue is catching up with Briscoe.
[123:32.17]Can't wait for it to go back to the lodge, and he slug-pukes on us.
[123:34.41]Nothing darkness and fun.
[123:47.24]Nah, he couldn't be.
[123:48.62]Where would you find a shotgun in the woods?
[123:50.86]I must be getting really tired to have a suspicion like that.
[123:56.88]Here it is.
[123:57.54]This is my car.
[123:58.80]Come on, get in.
[124:00.32]Let's get back to the lodge.
[124:01.52]Turns out, turns out she crashes.
[124:04.10]She totaled the car.
[124:07.17]Waiting for it.
[124:11.15]Oh, that's too bad.
[124:14.99]Easy with the door slam.
[124:15.83]I don't like how people do that.
[124:19.17]You know when you have that internal hatred of somebody that comes in your car and they slam the fucking door really hard and it really pisses you off, but you don't say anything about it?
[124:29.04]You're just like, hmm, fuck, dude, come on.
[124:31.52]It's a little pet peeve of mine.
[124:34.31]Don't slam the door so hard when you get in my car.
[124:36.33]Come on.
[124:37.87]I'm a toy.
[124:39.05]I think I'm getting tired and confused.
[124:44.27]Look, here we are.
[124:51.48]This is called saving money.
[125:00.25]We saved some cash.
[125:01.75]Oh no.
[125:03.73]We brought a big 1600s war rifle.
[125:04.73]Here he comes.
[125:05.13]The big reveal.
[125:23.69]He's gonna turn around and he's gonna have a slug in his mouth and he's gonna go loudly screaming at us.
[125:36.80]Brisco, do you still feel dizzy?
[125:40.78]No, I'm fine now.
[125:44.28]Let's head out.
[125:46.56]What the fuck was that?
[125:49.16]What was that?
[125:50.30]Oh.
[125:58.03]He was in the floor the whole time.
[125:59.90]It was a giant... Super Mario Minecraft thing.
[126:03.94]Now what?
[126:04.52]Oh, I wonder.
[126:05.38]Is the new female character they just introduced going to get eaten by this?
[126:10.11]Am I going to have to headbutt her?
[126:11.49]Shoot it!
[126:12.01]Shoot!
[126:14.87]What a scoop!
[126:17.67]What a scoop!
[126:19.79]Shoot it again!
[126:21.40]Shoot it!
[126:21.78]Nina, shoot the gun again!
[126:23.42]Nina, shoot the...
[126:26.61]Shoot the gun!
[126:30.09]I gotta save her.
[126:33.21]Okay, now he's gonna miss.
[126:37.92]Is he gonna miss?
[126:38.84]She's taking a long time to get up.
[126:41.92]Oh shit.
[126:43.08]Alright, shoot him again.
[126:44.88]Shoot him right in his teeth.
[126:53.68]That was really easy.
[126:54.56]Okay.
[126:54.84]She's alive.
[126:55.70]That is absolutely way more impressive than killing a bear.
[127:01.08]With a gun.
[127:01.40]Okay?
[127:01.60]Please.
[127:01.88]Right.
[127:02.04]Of course.
[127:24.97]Never mind me.
[127:25.65]What?
[127:26.49]We're not going to leave you.
[127:27.93]I can take this thing.
[127:28.97]Just get out of here.
[127:29.61]I can take this thing.
[127:30.27]I'm alright.
[127:32.19]I've still got some bullets left.
[127:33.43]I'll make this thing blow up from the sky.
[127:34.63]Turn and shoot.
[127:35.21]What are you doing?
[127:35.85]Nina!
[127:36.65]You don't have to talk to me.
[127:42.89]Why is this place exploding?
[127:52.64]Why was there an airdrop of like a missile on the building?
[127:58.47]What the fuck was that?
[128:05.71]Who dropped a grenade?
[128:17.11]Ah, Justin, I was getting attached to this.
[128:18.53]See, we already made the reference about that.
[128:25.25]That was unbelievable.
[128:29.12]Every female character they've introduced so far has died in five minutes.
[128:34.36]And the most obnoxious person in the whole game is still here.
[128:38.78]Why couldn't I push him into the guy's mouth?
[128:42.13]Nina was killed last night.
[128:44.63]Interesting.
[128:45.13]We just met her.
[128:46.87]She had four lines of dialogue.
[128:53.91]This is the next day at 6.45 AM.
[128:55.17]Yeah, we have an infinite supply of reporter ladies, apparently.
[129:04.40]We're here.
[129:06.94]The fog is thick here too.
[129:10.14]Yes, it is.
[129:10.64]We might run into some monsters, so watch out.
[129:21.41]It's so much more.
[129:23.83]It's so much scarier.
[129:28.49]What?
[129:29.15]What is she?
[129:29.47]I thought she was dead.
[129:32.90]Well, well, it's Briscoe.
[129:34.96]Who the fuck is this?
[129:35.68]Is this a new person?
[129:36.26]So you're alright, huh?
[129:38.44]Yeah.
[129:41.22]A lot of stuff happened, but we're still alive.
[129:45.78]Good to see you're alright too.
[129:48.50]How were things at home?
[129:51.38]The house was empty.
[129:52.92]Everybody must have escaped.
[129:54.62]Okay.
[129:56.13]But Jonesy wasn't there either.
[129:58.41]I'm worried.
[130:00.45]Jonesy?
[130:02.17]Our pet rabbit.
[130:04.05]Oh, okay.
[130:06.85]Well, I bet your family took him with them.
[130:09.35]So I think the battery is the completion of the game when it gets to zero.
[130:13.73]Did you already talk to her?
[130:15.17]So we're like, we got like maybe 20 to 30% more video game left.
[130:20.53]Good timing.
[130:21.33]Now we can go in together.
[130:23.03]And I can die.
[130:23.91]I can get eaten by a monster on camera.
[130:26.31]I guess we might as well.
[130:28.33]Good.
[130:29.59]Okay.
[130:30.47]Now.
[130:33.15]Okay.
[130:34.51]Let's really let the chief have it this time.
[130:41.83]We've really got to let her know in no uncertain terms.
[130:49.14]The teams go through hell out there when we're covering the news.
[130:55.31]Especially this time.
[130:59.87]There are people on Fiverr that will do a better job than this for $5.
[131:04.85]But she sent us out anyway.
[131:09.03]A lot of our colleagues have disappeared.
[131:13.43]Some of them are even dead.
[131:16.35]Like Pamela.
[131:18.83]God.
[131:20.73]I'd like to make that damn chief go through the same thing poor Pamela went through.
[131:26.56]Yeah, well, you know.
[131:31.10]She's so sick of hearing him talk.
[131:32.42]Damn straight.
[131:34.00]Yeah, well, okay.
[131:35.16]And you know what else?
[131:39.43]What?
[131:39.79]She'd better make damn sure she doesn't go exposing any more of us employees to danger.
[131:46.86]And she'd better let the ones who are left evacuate.
[131:49.86]I'm going to make her promise.
[131:52.42]She's going to be dead.
[131:53.66]And you, you get it all on tape, alright?
[131:56.14]This is going to be another one of those scenarios where you get in the office.
[132:00.32]Monster breaks through the wall, eats this new lady.
[132:02.94]The chief can try to worm her way out of it later.
[132:04.96]Alright, let's go.
[132:15.14]Into the chief's office.
[132:20.58]No, monster sounds.
[132:27.96]Nobody has a gun, do they?
[132:29.31]How do we do it?
[132:31.15]Does anybody have a gun?
[132:36.01]Oh, she has a gun.
[132:39.21]Okay.
[132:40.69]I don't know where you got that, but I'm glad you have it.
[132:45.66]How many more?
[132:46.02]Is there any, like, ceiling where I can hear them still?
[132:50.60]Why are you standing still?
[132:56.01]You fucking serious?
[132:57.71]Oh, come on!
[133:14.83]Well, you know, sometimes... Sometimes you... That's it.
[133:27.49]Okay.
[133:28.39]Game's saved.
[133:46.43]Another lady died.
[133:48.98]That would be number four today.
[133:52.03]Poor Adonis.
[133:53.83]He was a really great sound guy.
[133:56.85]He joined the company after I did, but I had a lot of respect for him.
[134:01.40]We went there to save him, but we ended up not being able to do a damn thing.
[134:06.54]God damn it.
[134:08.48]I feel so empty.
[134:10.08]Got you.
[134:11.16]Come on.
[134:12.40]Let's just head to Grant Park Station.
[134:15.92]Look, it's a Saki TV news van.
[134:18.95]There might be some survivors.
[134:20.81]Let's check it out.
[134:22.64]Oh, no.
[134:24.00]Who's in this van?
[134:24.78]It better not be like two or three new women.
[134:29.27]Oh, God.
[134:29.73]Alright.
[134:30.01]Hold your breath, guys.
[134:30.67]If there's like two or three women in this van, you know what's going to happen.
[134:35.61]Here we go.
[134:36.23]Man, this is awful.
[134:42.01]It doesn't look like there's anybody in the driver's seat.
[134:44.53]Okay.
[134:47.16]Oh, hold on.
[134:48.32]Huh?
[134:49.40]What was that?
[134:51.91]Is there somebody in there?
[134:53.00]Another reporter?
[134:56.60]Oh, no, hey!
[134:57.80]Hey, look, there's another person.
[134:59.40]Oh, it's Mr. Briscoe.
[135:00.30]Can't wait for you to get eaten.
[135:01.87]You're still here in the city.
[135:05.51]What about you?
[135:07.49]Didn't you evacuate either?
[135:10.11]It's another reporter.
[135:11.44]The chief ordered us out on a report.
[135:14.98]You gotta be kidding me.
[135:15.76]She's already dead.
[135:16.54]Yeah.
[135:16.80]More than one.
[135:17.16]Actually, it's five at this point.
[135:18.32]Start a timer.
[135:18.98]Somebody start a timer right now.
[135:20.24]It's 7.05 PM.
[135:21.04]I guarantee this reporter is dead by 7.10 PM.
[135:41.78]7-10, 7-15.
[135:41.86]Gotta get points.
[135:42.76]Told you.
[135:43.38]There's an elephant down there.
[135:44.67]Might not even be... It might not even be that long.
[135:47.09]This might happen before 7-10.
[136:14.72]Take out this loading screen.
[136:15.46]That didn't count.
[136:22.91]Okay.
[136:24.21]Did she die off screen?
[136:25.17]1253 PM.
[136:33.97]You know, now that I think about it, there are still a lot of things we don't know.
[136:41.87]For instance, how does the infection spread?
[136:46.56]How does it spread?
[136:48.72]Yeah, I mean... It's getting spread through the fog.
[136:51.70]If it spreads through the air, then there's a good chance we've all already been infected.
[136:59.16]We might even be infected.
[137:00.56]Oh my god!
[137:02.08]You're kidding!
[137:04.49]Isn't there any kind of medicine, like a vaccine or something?
[137:09.70]Well, that's why we're heading to the station now.
[137:14.18]The station?
[137:15.86]That's right.
[137:17.40]We got some info that told us it might be there.
[137:21.85]Oh, okay.
[137:23.43]Then we'll be alright.
[137:26.27]Don't scare me like that.

[137:51.65]Our news team went to Club Gochi and met with... Oh, she sucks as a reporter.
[137:59.20]Dr. O'Connor, a biotech researcher.
[138:03.90]We learned that the cause of the tragedy now occurring in Chicago is a new bioweapon developed by the military and Zaka Group.
[138:15.52]There's a vaccine that can save people from the terror of the virus.
[138:20.36]So we're gonna be located somewhere here in Grand Park station The question is will we be able to find it I Wonder that's this is the ticket gate just getting points.

[139:40.09]I have to get to a place where there's... Closed in doors.
[139:46.90]We need to look at the ground.
[139:47.88]I think I broke her hand?
[139:54.17]Oh no, she's holding a microphone.
[139:58.21]Alright, now what?

[140:19.45]No, I don't know what that is.
[140:22.29]Some kind of research document.
[140:25.18]Cultivating anti-gagney cells.
[140:27.52]Anti-gagney cells can be cultivated at room temperature.
[140:31.32]However, a culture medium of the following ingredients is required.
[140:35.43]Sodium chloride, potassium chloride, magnesium chloride.
[140:41.85]Anti-gagney cells can be cultivated successfully in a culture medium.
[140:47.44]Good to know.
[140:54.83]I gotta get a good shot.
[140:57.17]I like this angle here.
[140:59.17]It's very action-y.
[141:00.85]Except I can't run that fast.
[141:05.49]This is gonna make me puke.
[141:09.72]By the way, none of that was really in slow motion.
[141:12.06]That's just how it was.
[141:15.85]Have a look at this, viewers.
[141:17.31]What are we looking at?
[141:19.61]This car looks like it might have been used for transporting some kind of animals.
[141:28.18]These appear to be cages, but there isn't anything in them now.
[141:33.88]A part of one of the cages is broken.
[141:39.61]Maybe the animals escaped from here.
[141:43.56]Well, there's gonna be infected animals.
[141:45.20]I can already tell that's where they're going with this.
[142:01.42]Forget about the slow-motion bullshit.
[142:02.94]She is just moving slow.
[142:08.70]Now what?
[142:14.07]What do you need?
[142:16.33]You're on the air.
[142:23.31]Oh god.
[142:24.45]I gotta get out of this level.
[142:25.65]It's too slow.
[142:28.25]Trash?
[142:29.73]Trash bin's knocked open.
[142:35.26]She's on the red X. Do it!
[142:43.25]Newspaper in a trash can.
[142:46.03]Witnesses see a string of UFOs.
[142:47.49]Would they be flying?
[142:49.03]Why would it just scream at me like that?
[142:57.19]The slow-mo is making me sick.
[143:02.55]Well, there's something over there.
[143:03.95]Look, let's just quickly... Let's quickly get over there somehow.
[143:07.64]There's a dead body there.
[143:11.60]We gotta get out of the slow motion level.
[143:18.88]We must go slower.
[143:20.75]The Gagney virus animal experiments.
[143:24.01]Gagney virus was administered to a lab subject.
[143:25.87]Subjects were then observed.
[143:27.75]Stage 1.
[143:29.23]No particular outward changes discernible.
[143:31.45]No noticeable rise in body temperature.
[143:33.76]Actions, however, appear to be sluggish.
[143:36.36]Stage 2.
[143:38.35]Subjects spew leech-like objects looking almost like pieces of meat from their mouths, possibly the virus developed inside the body.
[143:44.93]Stage three.
[143:47.18]The bodies of the subjects begin to change dramatically as if becoming new life forms.
[143:51.42]As their bodies change, they become more aggressive.
[143:54.64]They also become more sensitive to nearby sounds.
[143:57.12]Hmm.
[143:58.00]It ends here abruptly.
[143:58.80]The rest is missing.
[144:09.58]Oh, that took forever.
[144:12.02]Oh my god.
[144:14.31]I gotta stay zoomed in.
[144:16.73]There we go.
[144:17.41]Okay.
[144:17.95]In this level, we gotta be 100% zoomed in.
[144:36.97]8 minutes?
[144:37.33]Impressive?
[144:38.15]I wouldn't say it's impressive, and I'll tell you why, because this has been at like 60 or 70% speed.
[144:48.49]Why did you come up here?
[145:02.65]Did you remember the guy that streams at 5 FPS?
[145:08.04]Hey, just be happy we have a stable internet connection.
[145:14.44]Oh my god, can we please be done with this level?
[145:17.91]This is a pretty good shot though.
[145:25.01]By the way, this is not necessarily slow motion right now.
[145:29.74]Well, now it is.
[145:35.84]Okay, just long enough to get over here.
[145:44.34]Dead body.
[145:47.30]Could it be one of Dr. O'Connor's underlings?
[145:52.40]Maybe.
[145:52.66]I don't know.
[145:54.58]More research documents.
[145:56.96]They have top secret stamped on them.
[145:59.86]Vaccine culture for the Gagney virus.
[146:02.90]Anti-Gagney cells.
[146:03.82]You have to call it anti-G cells or mutated Gagney cells.
[146:06.06]I don't even need to read this.
[146:07.04]This is like Resident Evil 4.
[146:11.32]T-cells.
[146:12.04]Look, it even is Resident Evil.
[146:15.34]administering the vaccine to prevent infection.
[146:19.50]The energy cells in the bloodstream have turned out all fucking wrong.
[146:24.09]Messed up their bodies.
[146:25.33]Turned them into monsters.
[146:28.57]There's not much else to say.
[146:32.37]Let's get some slow-mo shots.
[146:41.18]This is artificially inflating the pace of this game just because it's running so slow.
[146:50.20]Why would you write something... Why would you write top secret on something top secret?
[146:54.78]I mean, they write classified on classified documents.
[146:59.28]Those are top secret documents.
[147:04.57]You know, if I had a top secret document, I would just put it in a birthday card and put it in my closet or something.
[147:09.64]Like, oh, happy 40th birthday.
[147:11.58]And inside is like some of the most top secret shit you could ever know.
[147:15.16]No one's gonna open that card.
[147:16.66]Why would they?
[147:23.26]No one gives a shit that you turn 40.
[147:28.59]She's running in a circle.
[147:29.51]Where are you going?
[147:36.39]What's that?
[147:37.47]There's a light down there.
[147:43.12]It's going to be a monster's eye.
[147:44.26]Alright, she's dead in about 15 seconds.
[147:48.24]Here comes death number six.
[147:51.18]Nothing I can do to stop this.
[148:00.24]I'm just silent running.
[148:12.77]alright at some point at some point we could have just crossed over this way we didn't have to walk around the whole entire complex does this count this counts this is like another okay this is another person it's a dead body this counts there's a dead body here I think she's holding something in her hand I could get points should I get points
[148:39.38]Okay, I'm getting points.
[148:40.82]Alright, there you go.
[148:44.93]That's it.
[148:45.97]I'm not getting any more points.
[148:49.71]No more points.
[148:53.83]That's it.
[148:54.55]We got our points.
[149:05.66]Anti-gaggy cells are all over the place.
[149:07.52]They...
[149:09.36]They cause all kinds of problems when you ingest them.
[149:12.18]If a subject has already been infected with the gagley virus, they can't, you know, if you get tetanus, the tetanus shot ain't going to work.
[149:18.95]Warning.
[149:21.29]The functioning of anti-G cells drops markedly with any rise in blood alcohol.
[149:25.65]Don't drink or you'll turn into a monster from Mario Brothers.
[149:32.15]Alcohol in the blood has also been proven to cause problems.
[149:38.36]Sodium chloride.
[149:40.32]Potassium chloride.
[149:41.26]Don't say them all out loud.
[149:43.02]Magnesium chloride.
[149:44.84]Shh, get that in a fucking birthday card.
[149:46.42]Shut up.
[149:47.61]Hmm.
[149:48.57]It looks like they make a culture medium for the vaccine with these ingredients.
[149:54.69]Do you think we could find other things that have these ingredients in them?
[149:58.23]Oh, God.
[149:58.83]Like the sports drink I always have.
[150:01.77]It has something like these in it.
[150:03.79]What?
[150:04.71]Potassium chloride?
[150:06.85]I think so.
[150:09.53]Anyway, they sell that drink in convenience stores.
[150:12.43]Oh, no.
[150:12.89]We could go take a look.
[150:15.00]Whoa!
[150:17.47]I think there was a convenience store nearby.
[150:19.91]Okay.
[150:20.93]Let's go.
[150:21.49]Let's go get some Gatorade to make a monster.
[150:24.85]No, we're not walking.
[150:25.59]Okay, I was going to say, if we walk all the way there, that would be very... Oh, God.
[150:30.95]What did you... What a random fucking... Get out of the way!
[150:34.77]Random Final Fantasy monster.
[150:36.53]Alright.
[150:37.85]She's just spitting acid at her.
[150:39.37]I can't... What am I supposed to do?
[150:41.71]Oh, God damn it.
[150:42.71]Nobody has a gun.
[150:47.17]Do you have a gun?
[150:49.61]Nobody has a gun.
[150:51.97]You have to go this way.
[150:56.55]There's nothing I can do about this.
[150:57.57]She just dies here.
[151:03.19]Paula!
[151:08.63]Paula!
[151:13.40]Oh my god!
[151:22.28]Well, it was close enough.
[151:24.06]Oh my god.
[151:31.84]You gotta be fucking kidding me.
[151:33.30]So what do we do now?
[151:39.37]That's it.
[151:42.19]The reporter has a gun?
[151:43.17]No, she doesn't.
[151:47.05]I was hitting X on that monster and she wasn't shooting.
[151:52.80]Hey, bring in the next reporter.
[151:59.06]And plus, those monsters don't get hurt by guns.
[152:02.47]You can't shoot those monsters.
[152:03.65]It already told us that like an hour ago that those monsters are not affected by bullets.
[152:11.53]I was sitting there with the red marker on that monster pressing X over and over again and nothing happened.
[152:15.90]We're almost at the airport.
[152:18.20]The military transport is going to come get us.
[152:21.08]Time to say goodbye to this monster-infested city.
[152:24.78]Yahoo!
[152:26.50]Don't you leave without us.
[152:27.60]Oh, my God.
[152:36.28]Mark.
[152:38.16]Wait.
[152:38.38]It's Mark Bockwinkle.
[152:39.85]Hold on.
[152:40.11]Is this?
[152:41.37]What are you doing here?
[152:42.99]It's an alive new character that's not a woman.
[152:44.71]I'm waiting for my girlfriend.
[152:48.53]Do you think this guy stays alive?
[152:49.77]I wonder.
[152:50.67]Oh, shit.
[152:50.83]Okay, he's a reporter.
[152:51.31]I swear to God, if this guy stays alive for this whole thing...
[153:19.57]Watch this guy gets out of everything.
[153:21.11]This is a town just full of reporters.
[153:22.33]Okay.
[153:44.74]No, he's dead.
[153:45.42]He's dead.
[153:46.04]This is the end of the game.
[153:48.52]Watch this.
[153:50.82]This guy sounds like he's pretending to be a person.
[153:59.75]This guy's fucking weird looking.
[154:05.35]Good evening, viewers.
[154:06.73]This is Mark Bockwinkle.
[154:09.86]We're here at the Great Tezu Airport in an attempt to evacuate Chicago.
[154:15.82]As you can see, the airport, just like everything else, is blanketed by thick fog.
[154:22.12]Visibility is practically zero.
[154:25.54]Will the military transport be able to come?
[154:28.84]Control room.
[154:32.54]He's awful.
[154:33.78]I don't like this guy.
[154:36.36]I don't like text-to-speech Zuckerberg, really.
[154:40.09]We're here inside the control room.
[154:42.47]There isn't anybody here.
[154:44.45]Now, we have to ask, will a military transport really be landing here to rescue civilians?
[154:52.49]He's going to get pulled to the window.
[154:54.22]Something is coming in over the radio.
[154:55.54]Is this guy going to die quicker than everybody else?
[154:57.02]I wonder who it is.
[155:01.48]This is the 6th Air Force 274th Air Force 1C141 transport.
[155:05.66]We're out.
[155:10.42]So we can hear this guy, but we couldn't hear the other guy.
[155:23.83]Press the button.
[155:26.37]What are you doing?
[155:27.67]Press the fucking button.
[155:28.62]Are you that dumb?
[155:29.22]Put down the ice cream cone and fucking talk.
[155:32.68]Can you hear me?
[155:39.31]We're waiting for you to rescue us.
[155:41.39]Please hurry.
[155:42.17]Of course.
[155:43.97]That's what we came for.
[155:46.15]Booming the shot.
[155:47.97]We must turn on the runway lights.
[155:51.04]Alright.
[155:52.86]But which button is for the runway lights?
[155:55.88]This one?
[155:56.82]No.
[155:57.72]This one?
[155:59.54]No.
[156:00.22]None of these buttons work.
[156:02.52]Could the power be cut off?
[156:04.44]God, he's dead.
[156:09.13]How about Venetian blinds?
[156:11.65]You ever seen those before?
[156:14.08]What is he waiting for?
[156:16.00]I can't move.
[156:39.51]Where are you looking?
[156:41.19]What?
[156:41.41]Does this get like a weird Easter egg?
[156:51.29]Okay, what about over here?
[156:52.49]Hey, look at that map.
[156:55.57]There's that lighthouse.
[156:56.81]That was just the sound.
[156:58.93]The lighthouse.
[157:00.54]From Clarissa Explains It All.
[157:02.22]When Sam puts the ladder up and climbs into the window.
[157:08.68]That's like the, here comes Sam, coming into the room.
[157:10.44]What the fuck?
[157:10.82]Oh, by the way, just so we're aware of this.
[157:11.92]Somebody at work was watching porn.
[157:12.86]There are three or four computers in that room.
[157:37.95]That guy just is watching pornography or going to like sexy websites.
[157:43.33]And he didn't turn it off.
[157:44.25]Dude, you got to close your tabs before you leave.
[157:46.11]Even if it's an emergency, you close your tabs and you clear your fucking history.
[157:48.63]You know what I'm saying?
[157:49.77]Like, what are you thinking?
[157:50.73]Have you ever been to work before?
[157:52.48]Wait, what?
[157:57.78]He's going to drive.
[158:04.23]What's happening?
[158:05.35]What the fuck was that?
[158:06.43]Oh, no, it's not, no, no.
[158:07.65]Don't introduce.
[158:08.43]Who's this new character?
[158:13.28]Okay.
[158:13.60]Hmm.
[158:22.10]Is that right?
[158:23.70]In that case, you'd better hurry to the lighthouse.
[158:26.47]I'll wait here while you turn on the beacon.
[158:29.07]We'll meet up again after that.
[158:31.19]I'll have a talk with General Sanders.
[158:33.05]We don't even know who this is.
[158:34.55]Why are they on the screen now?
[158:37.78]Chief!
[158:38.82]Run!
[158:40.34]What?
[158:41.36]Is that any way to talk to me?
[158:43.18]What?
[158:46.16]What?
[158:56.57]Why would they bring her in?
[158:57.91]There's already a reporter here.
[159:04.16]Why didn't it happen to that guy?
[159:10.20]We already have a reporter here.
[159:11.90]Why did she get in front of the camera?
[159:14.50]Why didn't he get in front of the camera?
[159:18.35]Who the fuck are all these people?
[159:22.74]What?
[159:23.36]Shoot him!
[159:24.24]What?
[159:24.48]I don't... What?
[159:26.54]What does he got?
[159:27.82]What does he got?
[159:28.48]I gotta save him.
[159:53.98]I can't.
[159:54.56]Nothing I can do.
[159:56.30]I can't do anything here.
[159:57.40]Get in the car and drive him over?
[159:59.58]I gotta get a shot of this, whatever it is.
[160:00.60]Gotta get a good angle.
[160:03.36]He's gonna throw up right in his face.
[160:05.89]I can't hit him.
[160:06.25]Oh.
[160:06.31]Okay.
[160:21.95]This guy doesn't realize what's happening to him.
[160:24.37]Just stand there and let him throw up on your face.
[160:26.07]I didn't know what I was gonna do.
[160:27.85]I woke up and everybody was gone.
[160:32.43]I still can't believe that some lady came over.
[160:35.78]Where could Dr. O'Connor be?
[160:37.70]I wonder.
[160:39.58]What did you say?
[160:41.66]Don't tell me you're Dr. O'Connor's Guinea pig.
[160:45.22]What?
[160:47.80]You know Dr. O'Connor too?
[160:51.29]Where is he?
[160:54.45]That Dr. O'Connor is so mean.
[160:58.23]Poking and prodding a guy's body like he was nothing.
[161:03.82]And when I woke up, he was gone too.
[161:06.06]This guy sucks, by the way.
[161:09.10]He left me all alone.
[161:11.42]What the heck is going on?
[161:15.86]Hey, you guys.
[161:19.37]Get Dr. O'Connor to come back!
[161:21.27]Whoa, whoa, whoa, easy.
[161:23.59]No!
[161:23.71]Wait a minute!
[161:27.21]Don't go!
[161:28.33]Wait!
[161:28.87]We haven't gone anywhere.
[161:33.13]Who is it?
[161:34.03]Yeah?
[161:34.29]Look!
[161:34.63]Over there!
[161:35.45]Do you see that?
[161:44.00]What?
[161:45.16]Come on!
[161:46.30]I'll race you!
[161:47.36]Oh man, this guy's fucking freaking me out.
[161:49.18]Okay, let's go.
[161:49.68]Alright.
[161:59.34]Hey!
[162:00.52]Come on!
[162:02.04]Over here!
[162:16.40]No, keep away from me.
[162:19.20]He hasn't fucking moved.
[162:21.48]Stay away.
[162:22.00]He really is a mannequin.
[162:25.37]This guy is nuts.
[162:27.97]What do you want to do?
[162:31.57]You're not human anymore.
[162:36.02]He's a monster.
[162:38.44]It's kill or be killed, I say.
[162:40.00]Wait, why?
[162:41.80]He just stopped shooting him.
[162:46.18]Where's Dr. O'Connor?
[162:48.48]I can't shoot him again.
[162:49.88]Dr. O'Connor!
[162:55.35]Oh, my God.
[162:58.55]This is so dumb.
[163:03.53]He really is just...
[163:13.74]Yeah, okay.
[163:15.12]Mark's gonna stay alive.
[163:21.08]Here he comes.
[163:22.46]Shoot him.
[163:26.22]That's it, right?
[163:28.70]Okay.
[163:28.84]Okay.
[163:30.10]Ow!
[163:33.82]That hurts!
[163:34.64]Don't kill me!
[163:36.20]Please, don't kill me!
[163:44.71]So should we let him live?
[163:45.93]I think I'm going to let him live.
[163:57.86]What is with this guy?
[164:04.22]Now he's turning in.
[164:04.92]There we go.
[164:05.48]Alright, Mark's dead.
[164:07.72]What am I going to do?
[164:08.98]Oh my god!
[164:09.68]Run!
[164:10.16]Run for your lives!
[164:27.82]I think I lived.
[164:28.46]I'm going to laugh my ass off if Mark stands up.
[164:36.02]Mark is still standing still.
[164:43.63]The fog, it's clearing away.
[164:47.87]That guy, he was what was causing everything.
[164:52.37]Okay.
[164:52.89]Where's the transport?
[164:54.07]We really were just standing there.
[164:55.03]I don't see it anywhere.
[164:57.26]Let's get to the lighthouse.
[165:04.01]So apparently that was the... We made it to the lighthouse.
[165:14.75]Anything else you'd like to add?
[165:16.65]This is all just a dream.
[165:19.85]Now all we have to do is turn on the beacon.
[165:24.05]Look, you two go on without me.
[165:27.35]I've done enough work.
[165:29.67]Why?
[165:30.69]What's the matter?
[165:33.52]I've been thinking it over, and I've decided to stay here.
[165:37.02]We're going to stand still in the same spot.
[165:39.32]It's just me.
[165:39.88]You think I'm crazy, don't you?
[165:43.48]But nobody can decide for you what's crazy and what's not.
[165:46.82]No, that's crazy.
[165:47.54]That's dumb.
[165:47.80]You have to make up your own mind.
[165:49.04]That's really stupid.
[165:49.80]You're making a terrible decision.
[165:50.94]I suppose not.
[165:51.48]There's no reason for you to say what you're saying.
[165:53.74]Anyway, I'm leaving.
[165:55.24]I thought you were staying.
[165:56.58]Nina might be waiting for me.
[165:59.08]Did you say Nina?
[166:00.77]I thought he just said he was staying here.
[166:03.47]Why?
[166:04.21]What about it?
[166:07.03]It's just that that name...
[166:09.84]Where the fuck are we?
[166:10.72]Is there water here?
[166:11.55]They're all blended together at this point.
[166:16.43]What?
[166:16.75]My Nina?
[166:18.39]That can't be true.
[166:19.27]That's it.
[166:39.16]Well, no.
[166:40.54]Of course not.
[166:42.02]Anyway.
[166:42.96]I don't know what this even writing even means.
[166:45.33]Say hello to your Nina for me.
[166:46.83]So there's a different Nina.
[166:47.57]Invite me to the wedding.
[166:48.39]There's two Ninas?
[166:49.81]Alright, sure.
[166:50.57]I don't know if that dialogue makes any fucking sense.
[166:58.17]How did I get 1,200 erotic points?
[167:05.26]I don't even, none of what we just heard even had to be written down on paper.
[167:13.67]There's a different Nina.
[167:17.91]Oh, the porn.
[167:18.64]Alright, we looked at the porn website.
[167:19.90]Okay, makes sense.
[167:24.36]So now what?
[167:27.28]My battery's almost dead, which means the game is over.
[167:31.22]So this is the lighthouse, huh?
[167:33.24]This guy's dying here in the end.
[167:35.38]Maybe I am.
[167:36.80]Battery's gonna go out right when we both die.
[167:38.38]Is he chewing on something?
[167:40.40]Looks like it's just you and me now.
[167:43.68]Well, let's get this taken care of.
[167:46.40]They give Mark a half-assed dog shit write-off.
[167:54.61]And he doesn't get eaten by a monster?
[167:58.55]You know what I think?
[167:59.57]He's the doctor or something.
[168:02.56]I think that reporter knows who's behind all this stuff that's been going on.
[168:08.00]That one's the chief's favorite after all.
[168:10.34]That's the doctor.
[168:11.34]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[168:12.18]We've seen it all before.
[168:13.16]And that damn chief.
[168:16.44]She was the one that forced us all into this whole mess from the start.
[168:21.63]God damn chief.
[168:25.17]The next time I see her, I swear I'm gonna... Oops.
[168:32.67]I forgot you were getting this on camera.
[168:35.97]You'll edit that part out, won't you?
[168:37.56]Oh, sure, yeah.
[168:38.92]Yeah, why not?
[168:40.06]Man, that guy they were experimenting on.
[168:43.80]Gotta get that scoop.
[168:45.54]Do you think he was what was causing the fog?
[168:50.37]And what was up with that plane that crashed into Lake Michigan?
[168:55.17]I don't know.
[168:55.77]That's the first we've heard of this.
[168:56.89]Turn on the lighthouse.
[169:01.89]The final monster.
[169:03.21]What is it?
[169:03.95]Did it work?
[169:22.29]Come on!
[169:23.41]Let's go up to the top!
[169:30.39]Okay.
[169:31.55]All these deaths we've seen.
[169:35.56]I can't move.
[169:36.08]Everything's all confused in my head now.
[169:41.52]I get this feeling some of these murders didn't have anything to do with the virus at all.
[169:48.15]I guess I've probably just about got the whole thing figured out.
[169:52.65]Care to elaborate, sir?
[169:56.71]What do you mean by that?
[169:58.87]They've been snorting magnesium chloride.
[170:01.41]Alright, go upstairs.
[170:02.87]Hey, what do you think?
[170:05.35]Who do you think's behind all of this stuff?
[170:08.35]Now's your chance.
[170:09.83]What?
[170:10.85]This is your opportunity to let everybody know exactly what you think.
[170:16.17]Well, how about it?
[170:18.68]Um, you.
[170:20.16]Yeah, it's him.
[170:20.84]He's behind it all.
[170:22.98]That's the big, like, suit of 51.
[170:24.84]That's the suit of 51 twist.
[170:27.00]This is the doctor the whole time.
[170:28.32]And he's gonna eat me.
[170:29.01]Yeah, see?
[170:29.39]Yeah, of course.
[170:45.51]Without that fog, there won't be any monsters.
[170:49.71]We can go anywhere we want.
[170:55.88]I don't know why, but I feel so tired.
[170:59.64]God.
[171:00.44]I'm not feeling very good all of a sudden.
[171:03.36]No, Art.
[171:04.01]I wonder.
[171:05.53]Are you going to fucking puke up bugs?
[171:08.59]Yeah, here comes the bug puke.
[171:16.95]Somebody put Phil Collins on my Spotify playlist.
[171:23.83]It turned me into a bird.
[171:26.46]Okay.
[171:51.14]Why would I still be zooming in?
[172:05.69]Like, at this point, put the camera down and run, man.
[172:09.77]I have to get another shot of him when he's on camera looking at me like, yeah, man, you got it.
[172:14.41]That's it.
[172:14.77]The game's over.
[172:15.25]We won.
[172:15.69]Game's done.
[172:20.58]Beat it again.
[172:21.24]That was the whole game.
[172:26.60]And you know he was turning.
[172:27.34]He's like, yeah.
[172:28.66]Get that on camera, motherfucker.
[172:30.04]Am I going to get credits or what?
[172:39.98]No, hold on.
[172:41.08]There might be an after credits scene.
[172:43.47]There are three endings, OK?
[173:04.39]Every time a reporter dies and skips the chapter?
[173:08.95]Are you telling me that we skipped the whole game because every opportunity for a new chapter and the fucking person died and it skipped like 40 minutes of content?
[173:31.79]I don't believe that for a second.
[173:34.22]I was told this game was only three or four hours long.
[173:36.68]You're telling me it was longer than that?
[173:43.79]I did not lose 80% of the game.
[174:01.86]Look at the wiki.
[174:03.26]You skipped at least two.
[174:07.88]So I just filmed a bunch of people die on camera.
[174:12.77]And then went home.
[174:14.21]What a useless fucking person.
[174:15.65]Okay, hold on.
[174:35.16]Well, you did get that guy to say, oh my god, eight times.
[174:39.02]Okay, let's skip it.
[174:41.22]Hey, there's my final points.
[174:45.36]29,000 suspense points.
[174:51.35]Am I the world record, a divine being who has average skill and has a strong belief in rationalism?
[174:57.67]Movie theater.
[175:01.26]Is that my haiku?
[175:02.14]What does that mean?
[175:04.81]Press any button to next.
[175:07.23]Movie theater.
[175:09.91]Mark swimsuit.
[175:13.86]What?
[175:14.02]I don't understand.
[175:20.84]What is that trying to tell me?
[175:29.46]Told you it wasn't over.
[175:30.88]You thought we got the bad ending?
[175:33.13]That's me.
[175:33.95]I'm going to talk for the first time.
[175:36.02]I'll never forget you, Nina.
[175:38.28]Your beautiful eyes.
[175:40.38]Your lovely black hair.
[175:42.58]That soft, translucent skin of yours.
[175:46.20]And Nina, I'll never forgive the guys that put you in this situation.
[175:53.91]It's... What the fuck?
[176:20.89]What happened?
[176:21.53]I don't know.
[176:24.05]I don't understand.
[176:26.37]Why'd I get sniped?
[176:39.17]I'm so glad we didn't skip the credits.
[176:48.33]Okay.
[176:58.36]Well... The camera shot him.
[177:04.71]Do I have any save files?
[177:05.67]That's what I'm curious.
[177:10.61]Where is this taking me?
[177:17.55]Oh my god.
[177:20.42]Okay, no, we can't do anything about this.
[177:22.42]This is back where we were.
[177:24.58]Alright.
[177:26.98]That's the... So this is the lighthouse, huh?
[177:29.52]So it's based on... Okay, I understand.
[177:33.50]So you get endings based on how many points you have.
[177:37.89]Looks like it's just you and me now.
[177:39.91]Alright, let's watch the other endings.
[177:41.37]Well...
[177:42.56]Let's get this taken care of.
[177:44.44]Why did he get shot in the fucking head?
[177:47.28]Hey, what do you think of Ann?
[177:49.68]I don't care.
[177:51.12]You know what I think?
[177:51.88]Ann?
[177:52.03]What do you mean Ann?
[177:54.81]I think that reporter knows who's behind all this stuff that's been going on.
[177:59.83]Favorite after all.
[178:01.15]Hold on a second.
[178:01.79]I can't get out of here.
[178:02.85]Yeah, and that damn chief.
[178:07.69]She was the one that forced us all into this whole mess from the start.
[178:12.56]god damn chief alright let's let's go watch the other one I swear I'm gonna oops oops I forgot you were getting this on camera alright let's let's get you'll edit that part out won't you well that was interesting that was Michigan report from hell apparently uh apparently I skipped like uh 30 to 40 of the whole game because every single reporter died within five minutes of showing up
[178:50.43]Stupid game.
[178:51.13]I love it.
[178:52.91]Alright.
[178:53.33]I want to see the other ending.
[178:58.93]Endings.
[179:02.85]Alright.
[179:03.51]That was the secret ending.
[179:08.41]The thing we saw was the secret ending.
[179:13.03]Alright.
[179:13.31]Here we go.
[179:13.67]Here's all four endings.
[179:18.15]Let's just get it up here.
[179:23.08]OK, let me get this on screen.
[179:25.02]Alright.
[179:35.68]It's only like two or three minutes.
[179:36.72]It's not going to be long.
[179:42.41]Well, that's weird.
[179:43.67]That's not the right spot.
[179:44.69]Alright, there we go.
[179:45.45]Uh-huh.
[179:52.99]You come over here.
[179:55.53]You come up here.
[179:56.71]This is like just a website.
[179:58.59]This is so tiny.
[180:01.89]It's alright.
[180:02.40]It doesn't need to be perfect.
[180:03.40]We just need to see it.
[180:04.06]Alright, I'm ready.
[180:07.24]I'm ready to watch the- We already saw this ending, so we can skip this one.
[180:15.01]Your translucent skin and knee.
[180:17.55]I'll never forgive you in this situation.
[180:22.40]it's okay we saw that one so what wait wait wait wait hold on okay they're all from this perspective what what the is this guy who is this person hello viewers this is andy steamboat zaka TV cameraman I've just lived through some pretty terrifying experiences but the real horror is just about to begin all of you watching this right now I firmly believe you have the right to know the truth
[180:53.52]They all get shot in the head.
[180:57.06]Do they?
[180:57.64]No, they don't.
[180:59.24]Why?
[181:00.00]What a terrible... I thought it was gonna be something different.
[181:02.94]It's just a different face.
[181:06.08]This is Teddy Snooker, Zaka TV cameraman.
[181:08.58]Covering the news through all of this has been a real bitch.
[181:11.12]But now I can finally take it easy for a while.
[181:14.05]Hey, hey, what do you think about those sexy close-ups I shot?
[181:18.63]Bet that'll give the ratings a real shot in the arm.
[181:27.96]None of these are different.
[181:29.60]None of these are different.
[181:34.94]Here's another one.
[181:41.82]Look closely.
[181:44.66]It's me.
[181:46.44]It's me, see?
[181:47.74]Okay.
[181:53.85]What the hell was that?
[181:58.21]Well, those endings sure were very different.
[182:00.84]I'm glad I didn't play through the game four times to see.
[182:04.88]Now, here's the thing.
[182:05.32]Imagine back in like 2000 or like 2002, whenever the hell this game came out.
[182:13.25]Imagine playing through the game four times because YouTube didn't exist and seeing all these endings and thinking, whoa, good thing I did that.
[182:29.07]Well, that was Michigan Report from Hell.
[182:33.63]I think that was worth playing.
[182:34.73]I do.
[182:37.81]Was the game any good?
[182:38.55]No.
[182:40.15]I think that was worth a play.
[182:47.31]No one bought this game.
[182:49.07]Actually, it's funny.
[182:49.61]I think the game's creator didn't even know that it released in Europe.
[182:55.99]I think the Suda51 actually in an interview was like, oh, that's weird.
[182:59.16]I didn't even know the game released in Europe.
[183:01.64]He didn't have any idea.
[183:03.18]That's funny.
[183:08.44]But there you go.
[183:10.07]There's that game.
[183:12.77]And that was kind of the plan tonight.
[183:15.65]And also for the purposes of making sure the stream is stable, guess what?
[183:23.76]We have had zero, zero dropped frames.
[183:28.62]So I think we're back to normal.
[183:32.78]We're back to normal.
[183:37.08]Everything looks solid.
[183:37.88]How did it look?
[183:38.70]Did you guys... Any frames drop?
[183:42.50]Did it look like shit at any point?
[183:43.89]Hold on, don't answer that.
[183:46.51]Obviously it did.
[183:46.99]We were playing a PlayStation 2 Japanese-only PAL PlayStation 2 game on an emulator, so...
[183:56.78]On my end, it says everything was perfect.
[184:00.83]Comcast fixed the problem.
[184:03.49]We should be good to go now.
[184:09.39]But with that, we are going to end the stream for tonight.
[184:15.94]Go for about another probably like 45 minutes or so.
[184:18.72]Just hanging out, reading bits and talking.
[184:22.56]And tomorrow... Tomorrow...
[184:29.77]No, no.
[184:34.21]Did the guy ever get back to me?
[184:35.37]He did.
[184:37.21]I actually called again and was like, can somebody please help me?
[184:49.34]So, thankfully, we got back on track, though.
[184:55.73]So, sorry it's short of stream tonight.
[184:59.03]But the one thing you need to take from this is the stream is actually streamable now.
[185:05.51]I can actually do fucking live streams without any problems.
[185:12.22]Gonna be live tomorrow.
[185:13.72]Tomorrow will be a fairly long stream.
[185:17.48]We're gonna do more interesting stuff.
[185:22.96]Lego, no, tomorrow's not Lego Island.
[185:27.05]No, you're not going to have to wait like four days.
[185:28.73]I'm going to stream tomorrow.
[185:30.25]I might even stream Sunday too.
[185:32.73]Because now that I actually can, it's something I'm going to do.
[185:36.75]Obviously, right?
[185:40.42]But that was pretty much all I had planned for tonight's stream.
[185:47.34]Interesting stuff.
[185:52.44]Was it good?
[185:53.16]No.
[185:59.41]Let me move this over here.
[186:01.65]But before we go, let me get this on here.
[186:06.98]There we go.
[186:13.88]Alright, here's the credits for tonight.
[186:19.45]I actually am going to continue to run this stream.
[186:21.79]Not this stream, but I'm going to do a stream...
[186:28.31]Why is this not working?
[186:29.49]I'm going to stream to the Twitch servers again, the test ones, overnight again, just to make sure.
[186:37.61]But we don't have the music for some reason.
[186:39.46]I don't know why.
[186:40.06]But here are the credits for tonight.
[186:41.14]Thanks, everybody, for all the subs and resubs for tonight.

[188:31.73]Lushy, Zero, Zarath, Nasty Banquet, Spooks, Remilia, Kinger, Valken, KXZ501, CatsGoneWild, Cool8500, 2525,
[188:48.61]Thank you guys.
[188:49.39]That's a lot of you tonight.
[188:50.33]Thank you so much, everybody.
[188:52.35]For subbing, especially during this time of total fucking nonsense.
[189:18.84]Where the hell is my outro?
[189:20.33]What the fuck is going on?
[189:25.41]Hold on a second.
[189:26.21]Why is it not there?
[189:27.93]Yeah, let me just apologize.
[189:30.19]Hopefully this is the nail in the coffin forever here.
[189:32.37]That this is not going to happen anymore.
[189:34.48]Because I am still moving to the West Coast in the next few months, hopefully, here.
[189:40.92]But I hope I can put it behind me forever here.
[189:45.18]That I don't have to worry about it.
[189:47.82]Sorry that I've been all over the place.
[189:49.22]Streams have been pushed.
[189:50.16]Streams have been cancelled.
[189:51.16]They've been done at weird times.
[189:54.39]There have been shorter ones.
[189:55.91]I'm just trying to get back into it.
[189:58.53]Into the swing of things.
[190:00.97]And it's kind of hard to do that when your back is literally up against a wall.
[190:06.29]Like it's been for the last almost month and a half now.
[190:09.97]So bear with me here.
[190:11.57]I'm sorry that we've been having weird streams where they're shorter and I mean I've already said it.
[190:15.74]I don't want to sound like a broken record but
[190:18.82]You know.
[190:19.90]And where is my fucking outro?
[190:22.06]There it is.
[190:22.50]Okay.
[190:23.04]Why is it out here?
[190:23.66]It's weird.
[190:30.86]Weird.
[190:32.50]There it is.
[190:34.96]Okay.
[190:40.43]West Coast is not as good as the East Coast.
[190:43.45]Well, I just want to change the pace.
[190:49.16]But you can't expect that we're pretty much going to be back to normal now.
[190:55.76]Oh, alright.
[190:56.56]So let's start with the bits here.
[190:57.64]This is from a few hours ago now.
[191:01.57]Thank you, Spreo, for the 50 cents.
[191:03.17]Yo, sound guy.
[191:05.81]Oh, also, I want to get to throw this out there because it's probably going to end up being a change.
[191:11.47]I'm going to gauge your reaction to this.
[191:14.72]We'll see how everyone feels, but I think it's probably a better idea.
[191:19.57]I don't know.
[191:22.91]This is gonna sound real... This is gonna sound like I'm being greedy here and selling out here, but I really... This is not why.
[191:30.73]I'm probably going to increase the amount of bits required to read.
[191:41.18]Just a little bit.
[191:42.12]Just a little bit.
[191:46.74]Not by very much.
[191:47.46]We talked about it in my Discord yesterday.
[191:56.43]And... I think that as the channel grows... We've seen pretty large growth on this channel over the last year.
[192:05.64]And...
[192:07.89]I'd like hanging out at the end of the streams here, you know, for, you know, like an hour or so, like 45 minutes to like an hour, up to an hour.
[192:14.61]But it does get to a point sometimes where I'm, sometimes the end of the stream here is longer than the whole stream.
[192:23.28]So I think I'm probably going to get rid of the 25 cent bit reading.
[192:29.86]It's only going to go up by a little bit, but that's not, not, not tonight.
[192:33.74]That's not like this week.
[192:34.99]I got to figure out if that's something I'm actually going to do.
[192:45.36]I don't know how much I would increase it.
[192:47.22]It's not going to be something like, oh, you have to pay me 20 bucks to talk.
[192:51.81]But I think it'll help streamline a lot as well.
[193:01.76]Trying to get as much feedback as I could in the Discord and it seemed...
[193:06.52]seemed like somewhere around 75 cents to 100 cents 100 bits seems like to be the kind of happy medium there and I've been like looking around at other streams and stuff and just seeing like what the norm is and I think 25 cents is probably a little too low every big streamer ever 20 for read or sleep
[193:38.38]And this is not to try to get more money from people.
[193:43.78]Look, the 25 cents and above is still going to show up on the screen.
[193:49.37]But I just don't think, I think from here going forward, maybe not after tonight, maybe after like this week or another week or two streams, so people can get the word out that it'll go up to like 100 bits to read.
[194:07.51]25 cents to turn off the stream.
[194:13.35]But let me know what you think.
[194:14.83]Actually, let me... Please let me know how you feel about that.
[194:20.75]Whether it's in the Discord or talk to the mods to hit up some of the mods and let them know if they're around, you know, whenever they're around.
[194:26.82]I just never want to tell people they're not allowed to... Sorry, I'm skipping your fucking donation.
[194:35.14]Because there wasn't enough money.
[194:38.12]With that being said, just let that float around in your brain.
[194:41.15]And we'll go.
[194:41.99]Thank you, Spreo, for the 50 cents.
[194:44.41]Yo, sound guy, we got that already.
[194:45.75]Hole of one zombie, thanks for the one dollar.
[194:48.05]If somebody starts using a Luigi board, get out of there.
[194:50.97]That's a good idea.
[194:58.48]How do we let you know if you don't read any of this?
[195:01.80]What are you talking about?
[195:02.48]I just read it right there.
[195:10.07]What's the schedule for next week?
[195:11.11]We're streaming tomorrow.
[195:13.21]To make up for the fact that this was a shorter stream today and nothing yesterday because of the internet problems.
[195:22.82]We might even go on Sunday too.
[195:24.42]It depends on what's going on.
[195:25.52]I'll let you know though.
[195:29.62]Thank you hole of one zombie Appreciate the $1 of Marv ash Magali.
[195:33.46]Thanks for the 25 cents true crime was heroin.
[195:36.12]Well, this game is marijuana But really what's with the messed up speed in old games?
[195:43.07]And in fact it was not that game's fault it was my own because I was doing it through a program I
[195:50.03]Thank you, Bertnandez, for the $15.
[195:53.46]Appreciate it.
[195:55.02]Is this what Japan thinks of my great state of Michigan?
[196:01.18]Well, they never really talked about the state.
[196:02.54]They just said that this is what was currently happening in Lake Michigan.
[196:06.52]It wasn't in Michigan.
[196:07.30]It was in Chicago, right?
[196:14.23]Also, I...
[196:16.18]Another reason why the stream is kind of ending early is I'm at that point where I have a cold and you know when your ears just are popped and you feel like you're not even on the same planet?
[196:28.58]My ears are just... I have to do the thing where I open my mouth
[196:32.28]and try to yawn to re-pop my ears, and it's driving me insane.
[196:36.50]So that's kind of another reason why I want to, like, go take some medicine and just go chill.
[196:41.29]So it's gonna be $50 right now.
[196:43.29]Let's just, uh... Edgemont, thank you for the $50 fucking dollars right now.
[196:49.37]Um... Hey, Jeremy, it's Dad again.
[196:51.97]I'm glad that you're moving on to bigger and better things.
[196:54.89]Sorry I can't be around all the time, but just know that I love you, son.
[196:57.89]Great stream, by the way.
[196:58.93]Thanks, Dad.
[197:01.07]Thank you, Dad.
[197:02.98]For your $50?
[197:04.92]My allowance?
[197:05.64]My weekly allowance?
[197:09.08]Nah, but all jokes aside, Edgemont.
[197:13.24]You give... You give arguably too much money to this stream.
[197:20.64]One would say you give too much.
[197:23.39]But thank you.
[197:26.09]There's a lot of you guys that give a lot of fucking money.
[197:29.79]Doesn't go unnoticed, really.
[197:31.33]Thank you.
[197:36.42]Oh, by the way, also, starting tomorrow, we're going to have... We're going to introduce some new mods tomorrow.
[197:44.96]We'll do it tomorrow.
[197:47.29]So those of you, the few people that have been chosen as new additional moderators, they will be revealed tomorrow.
[197:59.51]A couple of them you might know.
[198:03.09]Okay, a couple of them you might know.
[198:05.07]It's only two, by the way.
[198:09.57]Yeah, Kyle's coming back.
[198:12.71]He's getting King Mod status.
[198:14.03]I'm giving him my stream key.
[198:15.77]I don't even care what he does.
[198:17.67]But no, thanks, Edge Mod.
[198:20.33]Let's go back to earlier today.
[198:25.38]Thank you, Mighty Waffle for the two bucks.
[198:27.68]Romance Briscoe.
[198:30.80]Alright, boogies just came out of my nose.
[198:32.48]Hold on.
[198:34.43]Thank you, Twitchy Turian, for the $2.50.
[198:36.47]Fun fact, the two in PlayStation 2 signifies the number of frames per second all the game's at.
[198:43.21]Thank you, Twitchy Turian, for the other $2.50.
[198:45.31]Fun fact number two.
[198:47.18]Oh, that's the same fact.
[198:49.26]So he gave $5.
[198:50.18]I think he double spent there.
[198:53.90]Thank you, Twitchy, for the $5 total.
[198:59.90]a that's a pretty good joke a bug just came out your nose are you infected oh I forgot to tell this on stream oh god damn it that pisses me off how many people are here this is an important story thank you for just reminding me to tell this now there's still like 1500 people there alright so I was walking auto outside right
[199:26.87]And you know when it gets to the part in the summertime where it's nice out, it's sunny, and if you live in like a warmer climate, you know when you're walking around outside and there's that insane, gigantic congregation of like 500 gnats that are all just spinning and circling in the same spot?
[199:45.48]You guys know what I'm talking about, right?
[199:49.60]No, not a turkey story.
[199:50.44]I'm talking about just a collection of, like, these tiny bugs that fly around, and there are a million of them, right?
[199:55.90]Okay, so we're aware of what those are.
[199:59.21]So remember, I have a cold.
[200:01.28]I'm sneezing, I'm coughing, I'm congested in the front of my head.
[200:05.81]Not really like that much facial congestion, but like annoying cough, headaches, sore throat bullshit, right?
[200:11.97]Walking Otto outside, and I can see these things everywhere.
[200:16.12]And every 10 feet, there's another like landmine of these gnats all circling, swarming.
[200:21.92]Anyways, Otto walks a little bit in front of me.
[200:25.54]and he's circling around trying to go to the bathroom and we're in this spot where there are a ton of these gnats flying around like 150 in the same spot right in front of my face I can't really move because Otto is trying to find a little place to go to the bathroom and I don't want to like him up because
[200:41.57]let's face it, I want the dog to do his business.
[200:44.33]So, you know, we can take a little walk around and then we can go back inside, right?
[200:48.50]Like, Otto, go do your business.
[200:49.94]I don't want to, like, be like, hey, wait, hold on!
[200:51.38]Because it'll screw it up, right?
[200:53.28]Anyways, sneeze starts coming on.
[200:55.64]I gotta fucking sneeze.
[200:57.34]I'm like, oh god, I gotta sneeze.
[200:58.86]And what happens when you sneeze?
[200:59.96]You guys know what happens, right?
[201:01.44]You breathe in super fast and super strong.
[201:05.98]So, you know what I'm talking about right before a sneeze when you go... Like...
[201:11.09]yeah can you see where this is going I probably breathed in with that quick here comes a sneeze breathing like 15 nets it was like like they're all it was awful I could feel them like in my face like it was the worst thing in the world
[201:33.94]And even if it wasn't even real, even the placebo effect, I knew it was happening and I could see them everywhere and I felt at least like three or four in my nose.
[201:46.21]I may have breathed into my lungs a family of gnats.
[201:51.44]The whole family.
[201:53.14]We're talking brother, son, aunt, uncle, grandfather, son-in-law, like they all went into my nose.
[202:07.90]You can cover your mouth.
[202:08.80]What do you mean, cover your mouth?
[202:11.50]If you're outside in the woods and you have a sneeze coming on, and it's just like... I'm telling you, I ate a whole family outside there.
[202:21.80]Cover your mouth?
[202:22.88]It just came on, like, quick.
[202:33.00]Yeah, it was fucking annoying.
[202:35.26]And even still, let's just say realistically, maybe like one or two actually like touched my nose.
[202:44.43]It doesn't matter.
[202:46.17]Guys, if I'm around broken glass, I think I swallowed it.
[202:54.45]It doesn't matter.
[202:55.37]Those gnats are in my nose for the next like six months.
[202:58.61]And there's nothing I will ever do about it.
[203:01.57]If I drop a glass on the ground and it shatters, or if a glass breaks in front of me, I ate a bunch of that glass.
[203:11.22]Doesn't matter if I didn't.
[203:12.78]There's glass residue that got in the air and I breathed it in.
[203:17.94]Anybody else feel like that?
[203:21.51]I could sweep up that glass, make sure I could go over with a vacuum.
[203:26.23]That glass is going to be there forever and I'm wearing shoes in my house for the next two years.
[203:35.38]Why are you sneezing with your face to the glass?
[203:45.42]Are you going to be one of those monsters?
[203:48.89]I get the same sense, but it's up my nose.
[203:51.09]Exactly.
[203:51.47]See what I'm talking about?
[203:52.17]I don't know what it is about glass.
[203:57.07]That glass just drives me crazy.
[204:01.74]I just feel like I just ate it or something, or like it got in my mouth or nose and... And then I'll be eating food a day later and I'll be like, well, then I gotta be careful.
[204:12.88]I gotta be careful.
[204:14.40]You know, I did swallow glass yesterday.
[204:16.48]No, you didn't.
[204:17.57]What are you talking about?
[204:18.57]You did not do that.
[204:19.81]Why are you even saying that?
[204:21.23]Stop saying that.
[204:21.85]Get out of my head!
[204:29.85]Yeah, rubbing my eyes, like I'm gonna get glass in my eyes.
[204:32.48]Anyways.
[204:37.92]Just do, just never leave your house.
[204:40.58]You can never accidentally breathe in weird shit.
[204:47.24]Are you okay?
[204:47.76]I'm fine.
[204:49.74]I'm not going crazy.
[204:51.56]Okay, if I'm crazy, I saw at least two or three dozen people say the same thing that I just said.
[205:07.79]Local streamer inhales entire family and eats glass.
[205:13.45]I think he may have swallowed too many gnats.
[205:16.27]Maybe.
[205:17.83]No, but they, like, definitely didn't go in my nose.
[205:19.82]Like, it was just, like, I could feel them, like, at least five or six of them go into my nostrils.
[205:29.03]And you know what?
[205:29.83]Maybe I was just like hallucinating, you know?
[205:32.09]Imagine like seeing somebody out there walking around in the woods, like sneeze and then like freak out.
[205:37.78]I just breathed in a bunch of gnats.
[205:39.62]I just breathed in a bunch of bugs.
[205:41.94]You'd be like, holy shit, man.
[205:43.10]Somebody call the police.
[205:45.54]This fucking crazy guy out there.
[205:50.64]They're laying eggs in his brain.
[205:52.04]Alright.
[205:52.76]I just talked about how we were going to like cut down on the end of the streams.
[205:56.73]And I just added like 25 minutes.
[206:08.16]Anyways, did you just you hear that that's me like feeling the gnats in my nose again, and they're not there Get over it Jeremy, then there's nothing there Anyways, thank you emooch for the $1.
[206:22.36]They just say cheer.
[206:23.06]Thank you sir feline.
[206:24.83]Thanks This is erotic.
[206:28.95]Thank you sir feline Twitchy Turian.
[206:31.45]Thanks for the $1.
[206:32.23]I hit enter twice on my donation and it posted the same joke twice There we go.
[206:35.59]That was
[206:37.87]That was the explanation.
[206:39.73]Thank you, Twitchy.
[206:41.97]Emooch, thanks for the two bucks.
[206:44.72]No message.
[206:45.32]Thank you, though.
[206:47.78]Connor Rowe, thanks for the 25 cents.
[206:49.52]I've lost a decent bit of blood from a really bad nosebleed just before the stream.
[206:54.46]And this slow-mo shit is tripping me the fuck out.
[206:59.66]Well, I'm sorry to hear about that nosebleed.
[207:01.14]I was on a medication in college.
[207:05.29]where I honestly thought sometimes that I was gonna die.
[207:09.05]I was on a nose, um, a nasal spray.
[207:12.45]Cause I had really bad, I had some like throat issues when I was in college and some of the, uh, the doctor that I went to at the time thought I had like really bad post nasal drip.
[207:22.49]So I was on a, I don't, I don't, it wasn't like, I don't think it was Flonase.
[207:26.91]It was some nasal spray that I was only supposed to do like once a day or something once every other day.
[207:31.53]And I did it, uh, enough times apparently where once a month or like once a week,
[207:40.33]No, that's not correct.
[207:41.88]Like, probably twice a month, I would get this nosebleed that was... I'm going to die because of this nosebleed.
[207:51.66]That's what I actually thought.
[207:52.66]It was terrifying.
[207:54.02]It was a faucet coming out of my fucking nose.
[207:57.60]And it would... Okay, and if you're eating right now...
[208:01.20]I highly recommend you don't just like okay you got like your fork and there's a little bit of like salmon on it and some blend some spinach just like like take the fork and just like scrape it off the side of the plate for a second and let it sit there for a minute or just mute for the next 10 seconds okay so three two one mute it 10 seconds okay we got about eight seconds so it would be like it would congeal into jelly and it would be this blood jelly that would be pouring out of my nose
[208:29.93]Yep, it was horrible.
[208:32.75]Didn't do that fucking nasal spray ever again.
[208:34.81]Mm-hmm.
[208:40.51]It was the worst side effect I've ever had from a medication.
[208:47.07]You're still eating?
[208:48.09]I told you to mute for 10 seconds.
[208:54.06]But yeah.
[208:55.52]Sorry to hear about your nosebleed.
[208:57.34]They're not fun.
[209:00.30]nosebleeds are panic inducing too because you know what you're never ready for a nosebleed if you're gonna your pants you you're ready for that right you go oh here it comes okay I gotta get up from my chair and just kind of walk really weirdly for the next 30 seconds into the bathroom
[209:23.41]Hey, hey, how are you?
[209:24.23]Yeah, yeah, I'm just going to the bathroom.
[209:25.33]I'm just, like, taking a bath.
[209:25.97]I'll be right back.
[209:27.01]Yeah, get in there.
[209:29.79]Okay.
[209:30.35]Looks like there's somebody in the bathroom currently.
[209:33.63]It's a public bath.
[209:34.25]Somebody's in here.
[209:35.33]Get the fuck out of here, man.
[209:36.93]Get out of here.
[209:37.69]Okay, just let me pretend to wash my hands until, like, the guy's finishing.
[209:42.25]He's in the urinal.
[209:42.89]Get the fuck out of here.
[209:45.01]Okay, I go in.
[209:46.49]He's out.
[209:47.21]Sit down, and I'm ready, okay?
[209:49.98]So, a nosebleed, you don't get to prepare for that.
[209:53.36]There's no like, I'm gonna shit my pants nosebleed, right?
[209:56.50]You're not gonna like shit your nose.
[209:58.86]It's not like you could hold it up there.
[210:00.82]It's just all of a sudden you feel that cool feeling of liquid coming down into your mouth.
[210:06.44]And it's just like, what's happening?
[210:07.66]Oh, this is happening.
[210:09.64]And then you're like, oh, fuck!
[210:13.00]And everything's ruined in front of you.
[210:16.54]You can't like hold in your nose diarrhea.
[210:20.97]It just happens.
[210:25.82]Cool feel- yeah, that cool, cold feeling of the blood going down into your lip.
[210:40.22]Get him off the mic.
[210:43.94]Somebody cut his-
[210:50.71]I'm back.
[210:51.53]You thought you could silence me?
[210:55.19]No, but it's hard to hear about your nosebleed.
[210:57.41]They're not fun.
[211:01.26]Anyways, let's keep going here.
[211:07.92]Thank you, Wincerind.
[211:09.78]Wincerind for the one dollar.
[211:11.18]Hey, Jerembo.
[211:12.75]I gotta warm up before I do some background drawings.
[211:15.47]So give me an animal and an object and I'll mash them together to create some sort of nightmare.
[211:20.45]Have a nice one.
[211:21.07]Okay.
[211:22.25]Thank you for the one dollar, uh, Windsor.
[211:25.48]Windsorind.
[211:27.34]Animal and an object.
[211:28.18]Okay.
[211:29.10]A... Okay, animal.
[211:35.08]How about something easy?
[211:37.80]A giraffe.
[211:40.22]A giraffe and an iPhone.
[211:47.64]Now, that's gonna turn into, like, one of those weird techno commercials when you have, like, a computer-generated animal.
[211:53.38]You guys remember Mio?
[211:55.91]The stuff you put in the water?
[211:58.23]They thought it was, like, a cool idea to have you go, like, do you squeeze Mio into you?
[212:01.77]And there were, like, weird animals on iPhones and shit, on Snapchat.
[212:04.75]It was, like, you remember Mio?
[212:05.97]M-I-O?
[212:08.31]By the way, don't ever drink Mio, because there's antifreeze in it.
[212:16.25]I'm not even kidding.
[212:17.75]Look up, does Mio contain antifreeze?
[212:21.39]The answer is yes.
[212:24.39]Don't eat it.
[212:25.55]Don't put it in your water.
[212:27.87]Squeeze a fucking lemon in there.
[212:32.39]Yeah, the little triangle things, yeah.
[212:34.77]There was a giraffe commercial.
[212:36.91]The only reason why I'm thinking of this is because there was a commercial with Mio back in the day where it was a giraffe and an iPhone.
[212:41.99]That's probably why I'm thinking about it.
[212:46.09]Anyways.
[212:50.07]Thank you for the... Well, the $1.
[212:52.75]There are your two items.
[212:55.32]Good luck.
[212:56.58]Son of Jenova, thank you for the $1.
[212:58.14]Briscoe sounds like you when you do your fake crying.
[213:04.38]Thanks, dude.
[213:05.94]Emooch, thanks for the $1.50.
[213:09.26]No message, just $1.50.
[213:10.24]Appreciate it.
[213:13.14]So he goes, whatever.
[213:13.94]I'm still going to drink it.
[213:19.96]Uh, Mito, thank you Mito Men for the 50 cents.
[213:23.04]Appreciate it, men.
[213:25.10]Narcoleptic Bear, thanks for the one dollar.
[213:26.65]The game takes place after all the filming.
[213:28.57]The player is just adding slow-mo to give a dramatic effect.
[213:35.74]I mean, you could be in the editing room.
[213:38.62]Technically, right?
[213:40.61]Thank your father.
[213:41.45]No, thank your father.
[213:43.51]Thank you, Father Geraldi, for the $1.
[213:47.21]I've been dying to see someone stream this masterpiece.
[213:49.46]So glad it's you.
[213:50.22]Well, thank you for saying that.
[213:52.00]I'm sorry that you didn't see 60% of the whole game because every reporter died within five minutes.
[214:00.04]That's not true.
[214:02.14]The first two reporters stayed alive for about a full chapter.
[214:06.39]Kind of.
[214:08.59]Thank you, Marvosh Magali, for the 25 cents.
[214:10.53]Nice trick, Jerma.
[214:11.27]You're slowing down the stream to hide the frame drops.
[214:15.89]So glad that's not the case.
[214:17.55]Zero frame drops in three and a half hours.
[214:19.57]That's great.
[214:22.09]Hole of one zombie.
[214:22.87]Thanks for the one dollar.
[214:23.81]Shoot Briscoe.
[214:26.96]If only there was an option.
[214:29.42]Yeah.
[214:29.58]I'm glad it works.
[214:30.22]That's another reason why I started early.
[214:32.02]I was kind of just so paranoid to start the stream that I kind of wanted just to... I was here.
[214:36.92]I wanted just to get it over with.
[215:00.57]Because my theory was starting at like 5 o'clock.
[215:06.05]Before it was 4.30, 5 o'clock.
[215:07.55]Starting at 5 o'clock was 3 hours before my scheduled stream time.
[215:11.96]So if there was a bunch of problems.
[215:14.28]I would at least have a couple hours to try to figure out what to do.
[215:20.16]And I only gave myself that one kind of 3 hour game to do.
[215:24.64]Just because I've been so fucking paranoid.
[215:29.75]understandably so but thank you for understanding thank you for your patience appreciate it everybody sir feline thanks for the one dollar she was the giant rat in disguise jermaRat can we talk about the gnats we just did they're annoying and they're everywhere
[215:54.28]Thank you holeofonezombie for the one dollar.
[215:55.92]It's hard to take Briscoe's grief serious when he has that stupid frog t-shirt on.
[216:05.03]Thank you reaper500 for the one dollar.
[216:06.85]In the next rumble comes the event of a lifetime.
[216:09.73]Once enemies, Jerma and Glue Man will form a tag team against Bitslave and Plainedad.
[216:16.03]I just read that out loud.
[216:16.89]Yes, I did.
[216:17.33]Thank you for the one dollar.
[216:20.05]hole of one zombie thanks for the one dollar again did you do the phone voice acting thank you werewed40 for the one dollar uh party 100 no erotic points story of my life BabyRage oh god
[216:43.62]Thank you, ProcefProStar, for the 50 cents.
[216:47.14]You didn't get the good ending, you got the bald ending.
[216:50.60]All the endings were the same, with a different guy's face on it.
[216:55.35]Thank you, MostlyLost, for the $1.
[216:58.01]Suspensfulness, you mean... suspense.
[217:03.10]Yeah.
[217:04.64]Yeah, that's true, that is what I meant.
[217:07.46]And when I get in the moment, sometimes I just... words just come out incorrectly.
[217:13.59]My brain goes too fast for my mouth.
[217:16.90]You know, it's like... It's so fast up there.
[217:20.44]It is... I got a six core processor in this computer.
[217:24.30]I guarantee you my brain is faster than that processor.
[217:28.43]Hook me up to a machine and find out how many fucking thoughts per second I can do versus this computer.
[217:38.29]It wouldn't even be... It would be no contest.
[217:42.20]We're talking about, I could probably, like, every second.
[217:46.18]Right now, I'm doing it.
[217:48.26]Three images.
[217:48.84]Like, four images a second.
[217:51.08]I got two more images that I just saw in, like, the next three seconds.
[217:54.22]What's that?
[217:55.00]Six or seven images?
[217:56.22]Six or seven thoughts?
[217:58.06]In eight seconds?
[217:59.66]What can this computer do?
[218:02.18]It's definitely less than 400 million.
[218:15.42]A processor can process like 500 million pieces of data a second.
[218:24.31]Assuming 3 gigahertz your processor is doing 3 billion operations per second.
[218:32.43]No, 36 billion operations per second.
[218:37.19]Hold on a second.
[218:39.21]How many operations per second does the human brain process?
[218:43.36]How many operations per second human brain?
[218:49.95]36 billion?
[218:52.81]Oh, hold on a minute.
[218:55.95]If the human brain were a computer, it could perform 38,000 trillion operations per second.
[219:05.28]Oh, the world's most powerful supercomputer, Blue Gene, can only manage 0.002% of that.
[219:14.22]Huh.
[219:16.06]Excuse me.
[219:17.52]You know how many images I just came up with?
[219:27.79]38,000 trillion is, yes, come on.
[219:33.12]Type it into Google.
[219:33.94]How many operations per second human brain?
[219:36.98]This is what I typed in.
[219:39.06]That's it.
[219:39.52]I just typed this into Google.
[219:43.00]And that was the first thing.
[219:45.87]38,000 trillion operations.
[219:53.09]Okay, now that I say that out loud a few times... That does sound like a... Is that a real number?
[220:00.70]That's not real.
[220:01.90]Thousand trillion?
[220:10.17]Yes, but we're also fleshy meatbags.
[220:12.28]Ever snorted glass?
[220:13.90]The first result is Quora.
[220:16.40]What's wrong with Quora?
[220:19.44]You guys are fans of that cartoon.
[220:20.90]You got a problem with the fucking website that they run now?
[220:28.18]Oh, it's alright when it's on Nickelodeon, but not when I get my information from it.
[220:31.54]Okay.
[220:40.65]Matting time.
[220:47.03]Snorting glass equals smarter than a supercomputer.
[220:55.52]Thanks for explaining the joke.
[220:59.92]You're welcome.
[221:04.70]Glass bug-eating streamer outwits top supercomputer.
[221:08.44]Oh.
[221:12.73]You know how remarkable our brains actually are?
[221:21.08]Somebody had to write that code for that computer to process it.
[221:28.07]You think a supercomputer can inhale six bugs?
[221:31.09]Nope.
[221:31.31]I don't have any emotions.
[221:34.35]That's not even real.
[221:36.75]I've seen Westworld.
[221:38.86]In fact, like, two weeks ago, I wouldn't stop making references to it because that's how I work.
[221:46.68]You guys are getting references and me pulling references to potentially the last thing of media that I consumed.
[221:56.10]I have so much to say about Westworld that I'm currently watching it that I will find every avenue to put it into a reference somewhere.
[222:05.84]Like cryptocurrency.
[222:07.30]I will find every avenue to do that.
[222:10.17]Whatever the last form of media I consumed is what I will reference back to.
[222:19.17]Watch it on stream.
[222:21.57]I will say goodbye for a long time if that happens.
[222:25.31]Anyways, thank you to... Thank you Scripps3 for the two bucks.
[222:29.80]Jerma, I know you started the recommendation channel on Discord, but would you be opposed to a gift box of sorts where we could gift you games directly?
[222:38.35]Or would you feel bad for doing something like that?
[222:40.17]No, just... Just let me know what they are.
[222:42.57]I'll get them.
[222:44.28]I'll just pick them up.
[222:44.93]Don't worry about that.
[222:45.77]You don't have to send me presents.
[222:49.45]You guys already pay me so much money that it's all good, man.
[222:54.37]You don't have to send me games on Steam or anything like that.
[222:57.71]I appreciate the offer, though.
[223:02.08]Son of Jenova.
[223:03.78]Thank you for the $1.
[223:04.66]I already said this before, but my bits were lost thanks to Comcast.
[223:08.64]I finally have my sixth month and ten thousand badge.
[223:15.16]Wait, no, no, no.
[223:15.98]Wait, what?
[223:17.08]I already have my sixth month and ten period zero zero zero badge.
[223:22.18]Ten badge?
[223:23.62]That's ten thousand.
[223:26.02]Son of Jenova, talk.
[223:27.00]Where are you?
[223:27.34]Are you here?
[223:27.94]Let me see it.
[223:30.37]Thank you, Son of Jenova.
[223:33.39]Your name pops up a lot.
[223:36.05]I recognize a lot of these names.
[223:38.70]A lot of you guys have been consistent, constant contributors to this stream.
[223:46.54]So, thank you.
[223:49.02]They had 10 periods.
[223:50.14]It was... It was 10... 10 period, and then 0, 0, 0.
[224:03.30]What about me?
[224:06.98]Of course, all of you.
[224:10.83]Thank you, though.
[224:11.65]Thank you, Savior of the Dreaming Dead, for the 25 cents.
[224:14.25]If you want more awful 90s voice acting, look up ghost stories.
[224:20.25]I've never heard of it.
[224:21.11]I'll look it up.
[224:22.73]Thank you, Tingy, for the 25 cents.
[224:24.03]Can you do bits in slow motion?
[224:26.11]No.
[224:29.80]I can't.
[224:30.98]Not like this.
[224:33.53]And I don't mean the emote.
[224:34.43]I'm talking about like how I am currently right now.
[224:39.08]Uh, Atrolux Atrox, thanks for the two dollars.
[224:42.26]Hey Jeremy, love this stream and I'm glad you got the internet problem sorted out.
[224:45.56]Have you ever been outside the US?
[224:47.32]I'm going to France this summer to meet my boyfriend.
[224:52.92]Well, that sounds pretty fucking cool.
[224:54.76]That sounds pretty fun.
[224:57.74]Uh, have fun with that.
[224:58.74]That's pretty cool.
[225:01.16]I've never been to Europe.
[225:03.86]I've only been to Canada, which doesn't even count.
[225:09.64]Canada is just America.
[225:12.81]It's just giant Alaska.
[225:15.07]It's just the Russian America.
[225:17.49]It's just a huge, giant piece of land that's also North America.
[225:21.77]It's not that different.
[225:24.39]I've never been to Mexico, which is also North America, but Canada and the United States are very similar.
[225:29.69]What do you mean, fuck off?
[225:35.32]What do you mean, fuck off?
[225:37.04]I'm not talking about mass here.
[225:40.50]We're talking about size.
[225:42.00]Whoa, whoa, excuse me.
[225:45.15]Canada, I'm talking about geographical size.
[225:50.29]I'm not saying that Canada is Russia.
[225:52.81]I'm saying it's like the Russia above America.
[225:55.31]It's gigantic.
[225:55.85]It's huge.
[226:03.78]Excuse me, I never once called Canada a booger country, okay?
[226:06.92]Because it's not.
[226:09.70]That's a whole pizza.
[226:10.80]That's an extra large pizza from Domino's.
[226:13.46]That's not a booger.
[226:20.42]That's not a backpedal.
[226:24.05]I've been to Canada like five times.
[226:25.53]I love Canada.
[226:27.77]You know?
[226:29.09]I could name you at least...
[226:32.19]one thing that I could do in Canada that I couldn't do in America and that um and that was drink when I was 18. so different up there up north did they change that how long has it been
[227:09.88]Get affordable healthcare.
[227:13.02]Fucking healthcare, man.
[227:13.96]Don't even get me started on healthcare.
[227:15.68]Okay?
[227:21.82]I never... Somebody just... Adam, you just quoted me.
[227:24.85]That is not... I never... You cannot put quotes on something when it was not a quote.
[227:30.17]You can reference and say that that may have been my opinion.
[227:33.07]That was not what I said.
[227:40.49]I'm not insulting an entire country.
[227:45.43]What, you think I got great things to say about America?
[227:47.43]Oh, how dare he say those things about Canada?
[227:52.08]Oh, just sit down and have a cup of tea and let's talk about America.
[227:55.76]You want to hear me talk?
[227:58.00]Whoo!
[227:59.42]Pull up the garage door and, like, pull up a few chairs.
[228:03.61]Now let's have a discussion.
[228:06.17]Hoo-wee.
[228:13.35]Dunkin' Donuts versus Tim Hortons.
[228:20.97]I never even had Tim Hortons.
[228:27.85]Every time I hear the word Tim, I feel like Tim Hortons is... A Dr. Seuss movie.
[228:34.79]Not a coffee place.
[228:37.87]Dunkin' Donuts is like a donuts and coffee.
[228:41.95]Tim Hortons is...
[228:44.26]Find the fucking Jim Carrey.
[228:48.26]He was the elephant, right?
[228:54.24]Right?
[228:56.00]Yeah.
[228:57.32]That's stupid.
[228:57.98]Alright, let's see.
[229:01.10]We're getting caught up here.
[229:05.35]Political streamer howls for 45 minutes about his awful opinions, loses 70% of his subs and followers.
[229:22.54]Tim Horton, here's a who.
[229:26.51]Alright, where we at?
[229:32.01]Garfield the Monday Killer, here he is for 25 cents.
[229:34.45]Hey, Jerma.
[229:36.18]I heard about the raising of the BitCap minimum.
[229:38.52]Not to worry, Jerma.
[229:40.10]You'll steal here from your old pal Garf with his bundles of Garfographs.
[229:45.36]In the meantime, enjoy the last few Garfcoin tokens before the big change.
[229:48.88]Get it?
[229:49.40]Change?
[229:50.26]Because quarters are change.
[229:51.48]Alright, I'll go.
[229:55.71]No.
[230:01.63]The change is only... to streamline...
[230:06.00]The end of the stream experience.
[230:08.99]As I talk about swallowing gnats for an hour.
[230:11.39]Can you see how fucking long it takes me to even talk?
[230:17.85]Somebody will say something in chat and everything will stop for 40 minutes.
[230:22.98]But I like doing that.
[230:23.76]It's fun.
[230:31.26]Thank you, Garfield.
[230:33.40]I hope we do not see the last of you here.
[230:37.40]Sprio, thanks for the $2.50.
[230:39.10]Briscoe must be the best supporting character in horror games.
[230:46.24]If he did a heel turn at the end there, that would have been much better.
[230:48.89]But, you know, whatever.
[230:49.83]It's all good.
[230:51.75]Clueless Sniper, thanks for the $1.00.
[230:53.15]Jerma, Jerma, oh my god.
[230:55.81]Oh, no, you're doing the Briscoe thing.
[230:59.46]Oh my god!
[231:02.71]Moo means moo thanks to the one dollar.
[231:04.31]Part of me wonders if the lead developer of this game got broken up with by a female news reporter.
[231:12.23]He's got a serious bone to pick with them.
[231:22.63]That's funny.
[231:24.72]Well, ask Suda51 when you get a chance.
[231:28.16]Savior of the Dreaming Dead, thanks for the 25 cents.
[231:31.02]Uh, Uma, Mr. Shin, I don't, it's a different, it's a language that I don't know how to speak, but thanks for the 25 cents.
[231:37.55]Savior of the Dreaming Dead.
[231:40.21]Atrolux, Atrox, thanks for the 50 cents.
[231:41.89]Did Vinny give you any Vinesauce merch when you met at PAX?
[231:44.51]Yes, he did.
[231:46.40]I currently have the, uh, the Vinesauce mushroom, uh, magnet.
[231:52.94]No, not magnet, it's a sticker, it's on my fridge.
[231:55.92]It's hanging out.
[231:58.08]Sitting there on my freezer.
[232:00.39]I got a couple of his music CDs.
[232:02.45]I got some... I got some Vinesauce swag.
[232:04.87]I loaded up.
[232:09.77]I don't have any merch.
[232:10.85]I couldn't... Here's mine.
[232:12.15]No.
[232:15.28]No, I... What do I have?
[232:16.42]I just have like a... I just have like a booger-covered hand to handshake people.
[232:20.28]Hey.
[232:20.56]Hey, how are you?
[232:23.26]I'm sorry.
[232:23.52]There's a bunch of boogers on my hand.
[232:25.28]There's not.
[232:25.78]There's not.
[232:26.14]Don't...
[232:28.74]It's not.
[232:29.48]I don't know why that even came from.
[232:37.57]I don't know why they'd be there, but whatever.
[232:39.39]Just pretend I didn't say that.
[232:40.31]Scratch that from the record.
[232:41.47]Remember, the end of the stream is off the record.
[232:44.63]Re-release the Glue Man shirt.
[232:45.87]Hey!
[232:46.53]Here's an interesting thing.
[232:49.69]Very soon there's going to be a couple of t-shirts.
[232:53.51]And then the second wave of Blordow...
[232:58.92]Emotes are on the way.
[233:00.32]There's going to be four or five new Blordau emotes.
[233:04.70]And then, after that, we're doing the emote contest.
[233:11.22]The remaining, like, five slots, I think.
[233:16.29]So, that gets coming.
[233:18.47]I just, I'm not, I can be completely transparent, most transparent streamer, of course.
[233:25.24]Merchandise is not even remotely on the priority list for me.
[233:30.51]When it comes, it comes.
[233:31.29]When it's there, it's there.
[233:32.65]And if you want it, then absolutely go for it.
[233:36.35]But there's other things that I want to get taken care of.
[233:39.29]It's not really high up on the ladder.
[233:40.81]But you can expect those things at least to be available probably in the next few months.
[233:47.73]Over the summer at least, I would say.
[233:49.59]Probably going to bring back the Glue Man shirt.
[233:50.95]I bet a lot of people say they want one.
[233:53.49]It's been a long enough time now.
[233:54.79]It's been like, what, three years?
[233:57.64]Two or three years?
[234:00.26]I wanted it to be an exclusive thing, and it was.
[234:02.86]You can only get it in one spot for three weeks, three years ago.
[234:07.31]So I think it's been a long enough time.
[234:10.63]And that on top of it will be also another t-shirt campaign as well.
[234:17.39]But yeah, that's kind of the plan.
[234:21.67]What else we got from GenieBoy?
[234:24.01]Thanks for the 25 cents.
[234:24.93]The stream calls for a new save command.
[234:28.59]I had nothing to do with that, so I can't make that decision.
[234:31.59]I have no control.
[234:33.47]I'm completely out of control with that.
[234:37.32]LuxuriaVitae, thanks for the 25 cents.
[234:39.72]My name, Jeff.
[234:41.92]Oh, I remember that guy.
[234:43.92]Never did find him, by the way.
[234:46.57]Garfield the Monday Killer, thanks for the 25 cents.
[234:49.16]Sorry I couldn't be here to watch the stream.
[234:51.98]This game is a little too creepo for Garf.
[234:54.08]Thanks a lot for helping my friend with your guru voice.
[234:57.28]Sometimes the world can be a little hard on her because of what she believes in.
[235:01.20]It's a little personal to get too deep into it.
[235:03.48]Nonetheless, she appreciates having someone encouraging some encouraging words from time to time.
[235:08.52]Thanks for being a spot of sunshine in this crazy Garfin world, Gerbil.
[235:13.83]Thank you, Garfield.
[235:16.18]Much love to you.
[235:20.46]Spreo, thanks for the $2.50.
[235:21.56]R.I.P.
[235:24.62]Briscoe, you'll be forever missed.
[235:26.80]Willy, though?
[235:27.72]I'm not so sure.
[235:29.48]I mean, he'll be in Jerma Rumble 4.
[235:32.34]Whatever the fuck it is.
[235:34.59]We actually have... You know, it's getting close.
[235:37.71]I usually like to do another wrestling event when there's enough new characters to put in.
[235:43.74]We're getting close where I'd like to have anywhere between 10 to 15 Rumble newcomers.
[235:53.77]So I feel like that's going to be... I'll probably think about that soon.
[236:03.55]And probably going to go back to 2K14.
[236:07.53]As much as I hate to say that, it is so slow and impossible to work with.
[236:13.77]There's so much more potential to make characters.
[236:16.85]The new games are so bad.
[236:19.17]Don't ever purchase a WWE game from 2K.
[236:24.17]Don't ever do it.
[236:26.23]They are absolute dogshit.
[236:30.73]And I don't care if anybody hears me say that.
[236:36.10]They're awful.
[236:38.86]Ever since 2K15...
[236:41.86]They have dropped their pants and taken a dump on that franchise.
[236:52.05]Never part with your money with that awful fucking franchise.
[236:59.99]Unless...
[237:02.01]You're a huge wrestling fan, and you actually care about, like, simulating wrestling matches and playing, like, the game.
[237:09.54]WWE.
[237:10.78]If you like Eli- The game isn't necessarily bad.
[237:14.72]Well, no, you know, fuck it.
[237:15.54]I don't even care.
[237:16.14]The game sucks.
[237:17.28]Whatever.
[237:24.59]When they detonated THQ and they turned it over to the new team... Oh boy, did they... They ran it to the ground.
[237:31.88]That game's terrible.
[237:36.14]I was gonna try to justify that.
[237:37.14]I was gonna try to bring that back a little bit and be like, well, you know... No.
[237:44.86]Oh, there goes the EA sponsorship.
[237:51.13]Nobody would ever want to give me a sponsorship.
[237:54.34]Because I will fly off the handle on their product.
[237:56.51]It's never happened.
[237:57.55]It never will.
[237:59.23]I will see one fucking little thing that I don't like, and I'll be like, this is the fucking worst product I've ever used.
[238:06.35]Don't ever buy this.
[238:07.11]This thing sucks.
[238:11.78]Even if it's really not that big of a deal.
[238:13.30]I know how I hate it.
[238:30.88]rage streamer no I just don't I just I have a problem where when I get upset at something I hate that thing that I'm upset at
[238:43.02]You know?
[238:43.48]If, like, a product is giving me trouble, or if, like, something happens in a- in a- in a minor problem, I'm just like, how the fuck did you get by QA?
[238:52.56]How did you get by fucking QA?
[238:53.94]Who's the idiot at QA that didn't, like, figure this out and didn't, like, fucking solve my tiny little minuscule problem I'm having?
[239:08.90]Hot-headed.
[239:09.44]Heh.
[239:13.02]I don't, like, break... That's the fun thing.
[239:15.24]I don't break shit.
[239:18.81]Do I?
[239:19.91]No.
[239:22.57]I don't, like, smash anything.
[239:24.82]I don't, like, punch my screens and shit.
[239:27.08]Like, I don't... That... I don't want to buy a new screen.
[239:34.75]Keyboard.
[239:35.22]The keyboards are different.
[239:36.10]No, no, no, no.
[239:36.82]You can't say keyboard.
[239:37.70]I accidentally dropped a fucking drink on my keyboard one time.
[239:42.11]I didn't get that out of anger.
[239:44.72]And I popped off the space bar because I put my hand down there and I happened to just... My hand was resting down here like this.
[239:52.88]I died in worms.
[239:54.66]And it was like, damn it, I died in worms!
[239:56.16]Shit, and my thumb got stuck and my chair got caught on my cord.
[240:00.76]And that, like, enough force was enough to pop off the space bar and it was like, fuck, man, oh shit, what the heck?
[240:05.90]I didn't mean to do that.
[240:07.26]I would never do that.
[240:12.25]I'm cool, I'm collected.
[240:21.84]What the heck?
[240:24.62]What the heck?
[240:28.08]God.
[240:29.20]Anyways, thank you to, uh... If you're here, please correct me, because I've been saying your name wrong forever.
[240:37.65]Is it Cire3?
[240:38.43]C-I-R-E3.
[240:38.69]Is it Cire3?
[240:41.27]Cire3?
[240:41.53]Sir3?
[240:46.73]Did I say when the stream was tomorrow?
[240:48.43]Uh, probably the same time.
[240:49.97]Between, like, 4 and 6.
[240:52.57]Just make it 6.
[240:53.67]You know, just make it 7, and it'll just happen before.
[240:56.04]That's the thing.
[240:56.96]I like doing that nowadays.
[240:58.60]Is even if I'm gonna stream early, have the schedule, have the sus be to, like, 3 hours later.
[241:04.38]So it's impossible for me to be late.
[241:06.54]So, just make it 7.
[241:07.68]It won't be 7.
[241:08.26]It'll be, like, an hour or two before then.
[241:11.98]Siri Cease.
[241:13.88]Siri Cease.
[241:18.35]Well, anyways, thank you for your $20.
[241:27.94]Thank you, CRA, for your $20.
[241:31.18]Don't ever change, Jerma.
[241:32.88]Love you.
[241:35.16]Thank you.
[241:37.38]I don't think I can if I try.
[241:39.16]I don't have the patience to try to pretend to do something else or be somebody else.
[241:45.93]I can only be me.
[241:49.52]Nobody else.
[241:51.49]But thank you so much, man.
[241:58.13]Frexter, thanks for the $2.
[241:59.33]Thanks for starting early and making me laugh out loud a lot.
[242:02.65]I just paraphrased you said so many times.
[242:04.37]I don't know why I said a lot.
[242:06.10]Really needed that tonight.
[242:08.60]The game was definitely funny.
[242:10.62]There's a lot of interesting moments in that game for sure.
[242:14.10]Glad you enjoyed it.
[242:14.86]Thank you for the $2, Frexter.
[242:17.04]Take care.
[242:19.73]Oh, I'm gonna puke.
[242:20.59]Duh!
[242:21.27]Tombola, thanks for the two dollars.
[242:24.76]Hey Jerm, it's Tom.
[242:26.36]Donated about my comic during your GeoGuessr stream.
[242:29.48]I'm working on another comic idea about a group of Power Rangers as heroes based on ice cream flavors.
[242:37.36]I swear to God, I swallowed a bug.
[242:42.13]I'm not even kidding.
[242:42.71]That just felt like I swallowed one.
[242:48.15]The heroes are Neapolitan, Rocky Road, Cookies and Cream, Mint Chocolate Chip, and Tutti Frutti, with the main antagonist being called Prince Sorbet.
[242:58.54]My question for you is, what should the big bad villain be called?
[243:01.25]It needs to be some sort of ice cream related pun.
[243:04.85]Got any good ideas?
[243:07.57]No, it's not Tom from Myspace.
[243:11.13]Uh, ice cream villain.
[243:14.12]Well, you gotta have the villain be a cherry.
[243:16.98]Right?
[243:18.60]He's like a cherry.
[243:19.28]He's really, like, pissy.
[243:20.50]He's got, like, you know, a complex.
[243:23.68]You know, like, Plankton from Spongebob.
[243:25.66]You know how he was, like, fucked up?
[243:28.36]The cherry is the villain.
[243:33.73]Don't make him too much like Plankton, because then people will be like, oh, this is your coffee.
[243:44.45]Plankton from Spongebob.
[243:45.89]Plankton.
[243:49.86]Same type of personality, though.
[243:55.21]How is Plankton fucked up?
[243:57.97]Uh, I don't know.
[243:59.01]You tell me.
[244:00.31]Guy opens up a restaurant, which definitely took tens of thousands, if not hundreds of thousands of dollars in leasing and equipment rentals.
[244:08.86]to open a restaurant across the street from somewhere that he is such a huge fan of, he's so obsessed with their hamburgers, that he only made the restaurant to try to steal from the other restaurant how to make that hamburger.
[244:23.41]You don't think that person's fucking insane?
[244:24.95]You don't think that person's fucked up?
[244:34.58]Don't even know the SpongeBob lore?
[244:41.44]They're called Krabby Patties.
[244:43.72]They're hamburgers.
[244:49.71]Yeah, I can make a bunch of hamburgers and call them, like, Big Rick's.
[244:53.59]That doesn't mean they're not hamburgers.
[244:55.94]Is a Krabby Patty a hamburger?
[245:03.74]Hmm.
[245:05.00]Lettuce?
[245:06.08]Okay.
[245:08.35]ingredients include lettuce cheese tomatoes tartar sauce mayo flour turmeric sea salt land salt barnacle shavings patty mustard ketchup secret sauce two buns and onions it's a hamburger oh that is that's the secret recipe
[245:34.73]That's a secret recipe, SpongeBob.
[245:37.17]That's a terrible fucking plankton.
[245:41.85]I want to hear that.
[245:42.89]I want to hear how fucking bad that was.
[245:44.97]Somebody clip that right now.
[245:49.31]I'm sick, okay?
[245:51.05]It's hard for me to do anything.
[245:52.13]I need to hear that.
[245:53.43]Please, let me be embarrassed at my awful, terrible fucking attempt at that.
[246:00.87]I'm telling you, I can do a pretty good plankton.
[246:03.91]When I'm at 100%, I'm at like 45% right now.
[246:10.99]Not even.
[246:14.72]Suddenly he's sick.
[246:15.90]I told you I was sick.
[246:17.14]Like, three hours ago we talked about how I had to... I took fucking NyQuil and woke up in like a fever dream.
[246:24.95]Let's see.
[246:42.69]Oh boy, that's not good.
[246:43.99]Yeah, let's never do that again.
[246:53.71]Please be the snort clip.
[246:57.17]No.
[246:58.76]Alright, back to the bits.
[246:59.84]Thank you, Spreo, for the $1.
[247:01.70]The chat demands an EU stream soon.
[247:03.78]Well, I've been doing EU-friendly streams the last couple of streams.
[247:10.03]Because I've been so paranoid about the internet.
[247:14.93]But, thank you, Spreo.
[247:15.73]Thank you, Pillsheet, for the $3.
[247:17.83]Here's the last of my bits.
[247:18.77]Hope you're doing well.
[247:19.65]Now that your internet is somewhat better, do you still plan on moving?
[247:22.72]Yes.
[247:25.91]I do still plan on moving to the west coast.
[247:33.17]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[247:34.52]The turkeys will miss you when you move.
[247:36.48]Sorry, that'll annoy somebody else.
[247:40.40]Thank you, Penny Kettle, for the $0.25.
[247:41.94]Don't waste your time on me.
[247:44.74]Well, that has not gone through yet.
[247:46.02]If that's what you're referring to, it's not done.
[247:49.27]Penny Kettle, thanks for the $0.25.
[247:50.95]Me?
[247:52.15]You're already the voice inside my head.
[247:56.62]Oh, that was... That's Blink-182.
[247:59.23]Okay.
[247:59.53]That's an old one.
[248:03.51]Thank you, Dr. Clay, for the $1.
[248:04.89]Hey, man.
[248:05.23]Glad to hear the stream issues are fixed.
[248:07.38]If and when do you move to the West Coast?
[248:09.90]I'm hoping I still can catch your streams.
[248:11.66]Not sure what the hours will be in that case.
[248:13.40]Take care.
[248:14.46]Thank you, Clay.
[248:16.09]The hours officially, if I move to the West Coast, which is going to happen, the stream will be permanently pulled back by about two hours.
[248:25.44]So instead of 7 p.m.
[248:27.68]Eastern Time, it'll be probably around 5 p.m.
[248:31.04]Eastern Time permanently.
[248:32.92]Because I'll be on Pacific Time, which is three hours behind where this is currently now.
[248:41.23]So I'm going to have to start much earlier.
[248:45.42]Thank you Djemperman for the two bucks.
[248:49.19]Just wondering how did you score all those voice acting gigs like Apotheon?
[248:53.33]Might be trying to make some money on the side of my new job and I figured you might have some advice.
[248:58.96]Um, well, let me just stop you right there.
[249:01.52]If you're talking about money, there's not that much money in like side gig voice acting, at least in the projects that, you know, if you're talking about, you know, if you land a huge fucking role, then you might make some money, but side money wise, just projects here and there, it's not really going to move the needle for you.
[249:20.10]They're more kind of for fun and passion.
[249:22.46]If you, you can see it that way.
[249:24.86]Um, but
[249:27.74]The... If you want, voice acting-wise...
[249:32.15]I'm not that good to give much advice on it now.
[249:39.08]Only because of what... When I started doing it 15, like 10 years ago.
[249:44.60]Just as, you know, doing it online for fun.
[249:46.77]I'm not even sure if a lot of the resources still even exist anymore.
[249:50.89]But... I could probably find out from a couple of friends of mine what the best resources would be.
[249:58.33]And if...
[250:01.91]You're in the Discord.
[250:03.67]I could send you along, just like in the general chat, just anybody that was curious, the things that some of my friends that are doing it and still doing voice acting and still are taking it very seriously and doing very well, what the best course of action is.
[250:18.44]Because I can't really give it to you.
[250:19.33]I don't really have that advice.
[250:20.49]Didn't the VA union just go on strike?
[250:26.50]Probably.
[250:27.75]Voice acting is... The pay... The pay in voice acting is really... Not what it should be.
[250:34.21]For a lot of people.
[250:34.87]Because you got like The Simpsons cast.
[250:36.37]It's like how I get like 10 million dollars a season.
[250:39.75]And you got guys that are... Recording fucking 500,000 lines of dialogue and getting paid like 7 grand.
[250:47.44]So... It's like... It can be a little skewed.
[250:59.00]10 p.m.
[250:59.34]UK streams.
[251:01.31]Move.
[251:03.73]Yeah, eventually.
[251:06.59]But anyways, thank you, DJ.
[251:08.43]DJ Emberman.
[251:09.17]If you're in Discord, I will throw those links.
[251:12.61]I'll see if I can get some.
[251:17.05]But I would try to do it mostly for fun.
[251:19.73]And... I mean, I don't know.
[251:21.99]If you're really good, too, if you get better and you improve and you be... You start to get a feel for it and you really fucking get better at it, then yeah, there's a lot of avenues you can go down.
[251:35.29]I wish you luck.
[251:35.77]Let me see if I can get you some of that info.
[251:37.15]But thank you.
[251:37.63]Thank you, Edgemon, again, for the 50 bucks.
[251:39.31]Appreciate it, man.
[251:43.36]You're in the Discord.
[251:44.26]Well, I can't... I wouldn't be able to get it for you now.
[251:46.89]It would probably take me a few days.
[251:48.75]Because the person I would need to talk to... I... I don't have him on, like, speed dial right now.
[251:54.85]That would probably take a few days.
[251:58.52]Luxuria Vitae, thanks for the 75 cents.
[252:00.52]I've got to settle this once and for all.
[252:01.92]What's the correct pronunciation for jupe?
[252:05.50]Is it Jupe?
[252:06.68]Jupe as in cup or Jupe as in jupe?
[252:08.92]J-O-O-P.
[252:10.16]Well, it's Jupiter is the name of the planet, so it is Jupe.
[252:14.43]J-O-O-P pronunciation.
[252:16.59]Jupe.
[252:21.07]You mean you don't want to move to L.A.
[252:22.39]like every other person?
[252:24.33]I'm not moving to L.A.
[252:29.76]I like California.
[252:31.48]I really love California in certain places, but I would not be moving to Los Angeles.
[252:36.96]Somewhere else, probably.
[252:42.81]Cup?
[252:43.19]No, the planet's name is Jupiter.
[252:46.45]It's not Juppiter.
[252:51.51]Thank you, Spoons, for self-defense for the 10 bucks.
[252:56.33]Hey, Jerma, I like the things you do.
[252:58.37]Hey, Jerma, if I could, I would be you.
[253:00.63]You're the one and only, Jerma, and I think that's just great.
[253:02.87]Jerma's stream, life is pain, I hate.
[253:08.17]Thank you, spoons.
[253:12.69]Yeah, but the word jupe isn't the word... jup isn't the word jupe.
[253:16.32]Yeah, but it's not Jupiter.
[253:19.34]It's Jupiter.
[253:21.22]You are making the planet Jupiter.
[253:24.04]So it would be... jup.
[253:29.71]Thank you, Cheez-Its Christ, for the $1.
[253:34.23]Emperor Zoran, thanks for the 25 cents.
[253:35.79]Hugs to you.
[253:36.37]God bless.
[253:36.81]Thank you, Emperor.
[253:38.14]Back to you as well.
[253:38.84]It was a time when I wouldn't eat grapes.
[253:40.14]Because my brother told me that they found spider eggs and spiders in the grapes.
[253:43.62]And I wouldn't eat them ever again.
[254:01.60]Thank you, Moodle.
[254:02.24]Thank you, Ratuna, for the one dollar.
[254:04.50]I just swallowed a bug and it tasted better than anything I've ever eaten.
[254:06.86]What am I supposed to do about this?
[254:08.35]August 5th, 2017.
[254:09.73]Yeah, but like, that was a joke.
[254:18.89]You know, this thing about the internet...
[254:21.26]You know?
[254:22.20]That is just... That is just there, isn't it?
[254:26.31]Thank you, D. Jemberman, for the $1 again.
[254:28.41]One time I sneezed with a nosebleed and it looked like my brain shot out of my head.
[254:31.53]Well, that's gross.
[254:34.48]Thank you, D. Jemberman.
[254:37.36]My ex-supeter.
[254:39.80]My ex-sup for the $1.
[254:42.58]This is going towards those gnats surgically being removed.
[254:45.81]Appreciate that.
[254:47.79]Penny Kettle, thanks for the 25 cents.
[254:50.72]110% agree with raising the bit minimum even though I donate in 25 cent increments.
[254:54.90]But you know, you can't resist a good sale.
[254:58.88]Especially in this economy.
[255:02.68]Completely understand.
[255:05.34]But that probably won't happen until next week.
[255:10.01]Just I want to give people enough time to realize that that's happening.
[255:13.87]This has just been an all-around growth stream, hasn't it?
[255:15.97]Yeah.
[255:22.63]Right when you say that, you just heard that.
[255:25.93]Yes, I'm taking care of it.
[255:27.45]Why no face cam?
[255:28.49]Hmm.
[255:30.19]It was shit like that that just happened.
[255:34.56]Thank you, Investigate311 for the 25 cents.
[255:37.70]Hey, buddy, how you feeling?
[255:38.54]I hope you're doing well.
[255:39.82]XOXO, love you.
[255:42.76]Thank you, Investigate.
[255:45.06]Appreciate it.
[255:46.61]I'm doing well.
[255:48.61]I'm doing alright.
[255:50.13]Like 80%.
[255:51.85]Mostly lost.
[255:52.39]Thanks for the $1.
[255:53.15]Jerma's saying he sees names in a lot.
[255:55.69]Jerma's saying he sees names a lot in chat, implying he actually looks at chat.
[256:00.78]Look at a chat gets me killed in games.
[256:04.84]I'm constantly looking over there.
[256:08.64]I'm doing it right now.
[256:10.24]See?
[256:10.34]See?
[256:13.41]Thank you, Casey, for the $1.
[256:14.71]In Wisconsin, you can drink under 21 if you're with your legal guardian.
[256:17.77]What?
[256:18.43]No, you can't.
[256:28.76]What?
[256:32.28]What?
[256:32.60]Hold on, this is real?
[256:37.29]Drinking age in Wisconsin is 21.
[256:39.05]Those under the legal drinking age may be served, possess, or consume alcohol if they are with a parent or legal guardian.
[256:48.58]What if you're like 11?
[256:56.20]So hold on, if I'm 11, I can drink in Wisconsin if my dad is like, yeah, let him have a fucking couple of beers.
[257:08.32]That's interesting.
[257:12.26]The parent's discretion.
[257:14.63]So I can take a shot of whiskey with my nine-year-old son in Wisconsin.
[257:27.13]Alright.
[257:28.11]I did not know that.
[257:28.79]You learn something every day.
[257:36.29]Best Dad?
[257:37.35]Why is the world so strange?
[257:50.82]You must be 21 to consume alcohol, because that is when knights were knighted in England!
[257:56.71]What the fuck does that have to do with here?
[258:01.51]What does that have to do with anything?
[258:06.65]You see, the reason why it's 21 in America is because the Knights of England used to be... Where are we?
[258:11.70]What are you talking about?
[258:34.48]Why is everybody doing that?
[258:36.99]Um, hold on a second.
[258:37.79]Excuse me.
[258:38.77]The concept that a person becomes a full adult at age 21 dates back centuries in English common law.
[258:43.57]21 was the age it was a person, a person, among other things, could vote and become a knight.
[258:51.67]Excuse me.
[258:53.25]Excuse me.
[258:54.27]And I, why, get cultured, guys.
[259:03.78]I see all these question marks, and you gotta do some research before you come at me.
[259:09.52]That's correct.
[259:10.64]That's why it's 21.
[259:18.56]But again, like I say, we ain't in England right now.
[259:23.06]When was the last time you saw a knight on a horse with a lance in his hand?
[259:30.41]haven't you know, I don't know where you are if you see that but You're probably at a renaissance fair
[259:51.37]A knight on a horse drinking a beer.
[259:53.11]That's right.
[259:54.85]Alright, I need to do something right now.
[259:58.92]And I need to mute to do it because no way am I going to keep the microphone on.
[260:02.88]So give me a minute.
[260:10.55]Okay.
[260:21.46]I can actually hear now.
[260:24.08]Okay.
[260:26.32]Thank you MooMeansMoo for the $1.
[260:27.80]To be fair, Canada is so absolutely massive that most of the population congregates in one tiny tip of it to avoid freezing to death.
[260:36.37]Also, Tim Hortons won before it was bought out by a shitty American company.
[260:51.41]You know who invented the internet?
[260:53.95]An American.
[260:55.75]So, I mean... Alright, come on, like... Who invented the internet?
[261:06.31]Some guy in America.
[261:09.37]And he was definitely an absolute unit, by the way.
[261:12.03]I mean, that's not true.
[261:22.30]What are you talking about?
[261:26.55]Am I gonna drop some more knowledge on you guys?
[261:31.35]Drop some more knowledge here?
[261:35.89]Okay, let's see.
[261:36.69]Let's see who it was.
[261:41.60]Uh, Robert Kahn.
[261:43.24]Robert E. Kahn.
[261:45.06]Bob Kahn.
[261:47.49]Bobcon is an American electrical engineer who, along with Vint Cerf, invented the transmission control protocol, the TCP protocol, and the internet protocol.
[262:01.16]The fundamental communication protocols at the heart of the internet.
[262:04.60]Hmm.
[262:05.82]And guess who Vint Cerf is?
[262:08.28]Vint Cerf is also an American internet pioneer.
[262:11.32]Hmm.
[262:13.59]You know.
[262:15.14]Guys that created TCP IP.
[262:17.30]That's the internet.
[262:18.28]That's where the internet came from.
[262:28.94]Wrong?
[262:29.30]What do you mean wrong?
[262:30.48]Bob Kahn invented TCP IP.
[262:34.78]It's there.
[262:35.32]It's in black and white.
[262:36.18]It's on the books.
[262:42.43]Look, Bob Kahn is still alive.
[262:44.15]He's 79.
[262:44.89]You can go ask him.
[262:56.82]It's as clear as a damn crystal.
[263:02.76]A British dude made the computer.
[263:04.06]Well, we're not arguing who invented the computer.
[263:06.46]We're saying who created the internet.
[263:14.42]TCP IP was the foundation of the entire internet.
[263:19.24]That's the internet.
[263:29.21]I was at Bobcon last year and he said you're full of shit.
[263:37.47]Alright, hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[263:39.59]You gotta have your definition of the internet.
[263:41.73]Are you talking about like the protocol that it all runs on, the actual protocol, or like the World Wide Web?
[263:53.92]Because protocol is the foundation of how it even communicates.
[263:59.22]That's the internet.
[264:10.55]World Wide Web is what's built on top of TCP IP.
[264:20.09]You're talking about chicken and egg.
[264:21.93]You're talking about the egg.
[264:23.83]I'm talking about the chicken.
[264:27.51]You can't have both.
[264:28.96]The egg comes out of the chicken.
[264:32.28]You guys are talking about the frosting on the cake.
[264:36.48]Yeah, this guy made the frosting.
[264:38.28]Oh yeah, I invented frosting.
[264:39.74]Who made the cake the frosting sits on?
[264:42.75]Huh.
[264:44.21]Come on.
[264:46.83]It was fucking Bob Costas.
[264:53.44]No, not even the actual cake.
[264:56.32]These guys made the ingredients of the cake.
[265:06.28]I don't even look at a cake without frosting.
[265:08.10]Yeah, but that doesn't mean it doesn't... Come on.
[265:10.61]You can't just eat frosting.
[265:12.61]You can't just eat the World Wide Web.
[265:14.09]You need to have it sit on the cake on TCP IP.
[265:17.91]And you know that thing that you need to connect to?
[265:19.91]That server?
[265:20.73]Like... Oh, I've got to open up my... I've got to open up my fucking Battlefield server browser.
[265:26.01]TCP IP.
[265:29.37]Thank you, God fucking thank Bobcon for his fucking wonderful work.
[265:36.98]That's like saying a candle was the first light bulb.
[265:39.62]Well, no, it is not.
[265:42.74]What?
[265:44.67]No, that's, you can't, that doesn't, no, no, no, no, no.
[265:50.37]We're talking about the applications built on top of the protocol that, mm-mm, ah, ah, ah, ah.
[265:56.36]You're not gonna tomato, tomato me here.
[266:13.23]Alright, let's finish up the bits.
[266:15.49]I don't even know.
[266:20.42]How do we even get there?
[266:32.13]Where are we?
[266:32.73]Here we go.
[266:34.41]Oh, thank you.
[266:36.55]We got that from somewhere from 21.
[266:38.05]Oh, it's because you guys didn't believe me.
[266:41.31]And then everyone said that America sucks.
[266:42.79]And I said, no, but the American guy made the internet.
[266:45.29]And that's correct.
[266:47.59]The guy that invented the internet.
[266:51.46]That's a correct statement.
[266:52.80]I'm not talking about an application that eventually was put on the internet.
[266:56.58]I'm not talking about a product.
[266:57.90]We're talking about protocol that was the base.
[266:59.88]And that's what we're talking about.
[267:01.17]Okay, so thank you.
[267:02.87]Mostly lost for the $1.
[267:04.73]I literally, I'm not going to say that.
[267:08.41]I almost just said it.
[267:21.98]You got here because I mentioned that an American company ruined Tim Hortons.
[267:25.56]Oh, man.
[267:29.12]I'm telling you.
[267:29.50]I drank like NyQuil and I'm all fucked up.
[267:35.22]Thank you.
[267:35.70]Mostly lost for the $1.
[267:36.88]Moo means moo.
[267:37.42]Thanks for the $1.
[267:38.04]To be fair...
[267:39.57]Cali... What happened?
[267:42.39]Okay, this is what got us off.
[267:43.71]I'm not gonna go off on an American again.
[267:46.27]Thank you Snooze and Copter for the 85 cents.
[267:49.62]Piss in my face.
[267:50.46]Go ahead, piss.
[267:52.30]Thank you Mostly Lost for the $1.
[267:53.96]Get some merch and donate the proceeds to charity if you're feeling self-conscious about it.
[267:58.74]Lots of people want merch.
[268:01.28]Yeah, there's a lot of avenues to pursue.
[268:05.65]It's not about, like, the money, getting paid money for it as much as it is.
[268:09.43]I get weird about that kind of shit.
[268:13.05]I don't know why.
[268:13.93]I, like, really don't know why.
[268:16.68]I could never explain why that is.
[268:21.56]But, yeah, you know, whatever.
[268:25.60]It's definitely an option, though.
[268:26.48]Thank you, MostlyLost.
[268:27.24]Thank you, SirFeline, for the $1 jermaRat t-shirt or riot...

[268:48.44]Oh, fuck, it has ruined the Christmas surprise.
[268:50.20]Whoops.
[268:54.93]Tom Bola, thanks for the 25 cents.
[268:56.33]Hey, Jerma, it's Tom.

[269:04.13]Hasnain, thanks for the one dollar.

[270:47.03]Did you manage to steal the Declaration of Independence yet?
[270:50.09]Love you, by the way.
[270:52.07]Uh, no.
[270:53.49]It's currently, it's like, isn't this, the Declaration of Independence is like in some Nicolas Cage movie, right?
[271:00.06]What was it called?
[271:02.40]National Treasure.
[271:04.48]Where the Declaration of Independence was actually, it was a treasure map and it led him to like a bunch of money.
[271:10.14]They have, it's in like a production van somewhere, who knows.
[271:14.57]And last but not least, thank you Dr. Clay for the one dollar.

[272:11.65]Hopefully it continues.
[272:13.23]I'm not going to get baited here and be super excited yet.
