[01:43.83]Yeah.
[01:45.13]After this, I'm going to be moving to that last hero, Nostalgia.
[01:54.14]Should be a fun night.
[01:54.84]Looking forward to it.
[01:57.56]If you don't know what Wild Hearts is, it's in that monster hunting, kind of Monster Hunter: World, where it's kind of a monster hunting strategy action game.
[02:10.09]So if you liked Monster Hunter, you probably would like this too.
[02:15.78]That world of this type of hunting game.

[02:54.78]Like I've seen the concerns.
[02:57.08]And let me tell you, no, I'm fine.
[03:00.84]I'm not bald.
[03:02.20]I heard the theory that, oh, I know why he doesn't have the facecam on anymore.
[03:07.44]It's because he's bald and he went bald and doesn't want to show us.
[03:10.62]Nope.
[03:12.16]We're good.
[03:14.26]But yeah, thank you EA for sponsoring the stream.
[03:16.48]Let's get started.
[03:17.16]Wild hearts.
[03:18.71]Vinny, how are you?
[03:22.98]Oh, I forgot to unmute.
[03:23.88]Hey.
[03:24.92]Hey, Jerma.
[03:28.82]Hey, how are you?
[03:30.52]I'm good.
[03:30.96]We were talking about mitochondria.
[03:34.25]Really?
[03:35.75]Yeah.
[03:37.29]What about mitochondria?
[03:40.14]just cool so um so so yes uh how are you I'm doing alright we need to get we need to bring people up to speed of what happened we did the tutorial already we want to get right into the goddamn game you understand so we have not picked weapons I know there are weapons I think we're still in the tutorial yeah I think that's correct
[04:07.32]It looks like, yeah, we just rescued someone and we just set up camp.
[04:12.34]And this is the earliest we could play online together.
[04:15.10]So we're not sure where this is going to go.
[04:18.21]But at the moment, I guess we both have long katanas.
[04:21.81]And that's how we will kill this rat.
[04:25.03]Spoiler!
[04:25.53]Oh, right.
[04:26.97]Sorry.
[04:27.19]A rat broke through this and you didn't get to see it.
[04:31.26]So we have to go hunt this rat.
[04:32.30]It was actually really cool.
[04:33.90]I'm very sad you didn't see it.
[04:35.87]This game has a kind of a weird gameplay mechanic too, where you can conjure crates.
[04:41.48]Have you seen that?
[04:42.76]Yeah.
[04:43.78]You can make... Watch this.
[04:46.14]Ready?
[04:46.30]Check this out.
[04:50.07]I have to stand up first.
[04:50.75]Ready?
[04:51.81]Yeah.
[04:52.01]Alright.
[04:52.65]Now watch this.
[04:57.63]Where'd you go?
[04:58.13]I don't even know where you went.
[04:59.31]Oh, wow.
[04:59.63]That's amazing.
[05:01.97]Wow.
[05:02.45]Oh, sorry.
[05:02.77]I did it.
[05:03.05]I just, like, freaked you out.
[05:03.71]You can, like, jump off.
[05:04.97]You build stuff.
[05:06.71]It seems pretty fun.
[05:08.43]Yeah, it's like Breath of the Fork Knife.
[05:11.86]Something like that.
[05:13.46]We have to hunt this rat.
[05:15.66]We've got to kill a rat.
[05:16.86]But, you know, it looks really cool because I like the rat.
[05:19.74]I almost don't want to kill it.
[05:21.10]This is kind of the intro monster.
[05:22.90]Yeah.
[05:25.37]Alright, Vinny, you ready?
[05:27.21]Yeah, yeah, let's do this.
[05:33.70]What is this?
[05:34.44]Hunt Ragtail.
[05:37.74]Get him!
[05:38.04]Okay.
[05:39.08]I'm trying.
[05:40.28]I'm pressing the wrong buttons.
[05:41.84]Do you ever, like, play a game a lot and then get used to those buttons and then have to get used to a whole new set of buttons?
[05:48.88]Yep.
[05:49.20]And your brain doesn't know how to, like...
[05:52.06]Oh, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[05:52.80]Ready?
[05:53.82]Use your, hold on, ready?
[05:55.00]Alright, that's actually pretty cool.
[05:59.46]Can we do it?
[06:03.14]I don't think I did a very good job, but I heard some weird noises.
[06:06.78]Yeah, you can jump off these crates.
[06:12.55]That does a lot of damage.
[06:14.25]You can lock on to, you probably figured this out already, but yeah.
[06:18.31]How high can you put the crates?
[06:20.51]three at the moment maybe there's like a oh they're just like everywhere can you get the tail like can we can we do that I wonder I hope though because you've played other similar set such unnamed monster games yeah Monster Hunter has that in it too right yeah like does the Monster Hunter have that yeah wait gotta get the flowers
[06:52.26]If you get low on health, press up, I think, on the D-pad to heal.
[06:55.54]I wonder if that's a consumable.
[07:02.12]What is, like, the rat's tail?
[07:03.38]No, no, no, like the heel.
[07:07.04]Oh, it is, it is, yeah.
[07:09.03]Can you eat the tail?
[07:11.29]Yeah, that's what I thought.
[07:12.69]No, you can... Oh, I'm going to die.
[07:17.09]There's, like, these healing plants.
[07:19.73]There we go.
[07:21.87]E3 gameplay commentary.
[07:24.99]I got your back!
[07:26.29]Chef, I've got your back!
[07:27.35]Stacking crates!
[07:28.01]Just stacking crates now!
[07:30.17]Quick!
[07:30.49]Do a barrel roll!
[07:31.63]I missed!
[07:34.83]Oh, there's crates over here.
[07:36.59]Yeah, there you go.
[07:38.23]Oh, sick.
[07:38.67]I just did 100 damage.
[07:39.81]Get it!
[07:40.09]Now it's time!
[07:40.45]Now it's time!
[07:41.31]Go right ahead.
[07:42.07]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[07:43.65]Now it's time.
[07:44.99]Now it's time!
[07:45.77]I think you can charge swings too.
[07:48.07]Oh, you can?
[07:48.47]Do you do ranged or do you do melee?
[07:52.84]In, let's say, generic monster game where you hunt said monsters, whatever it may be called, I usually go for the Switch Axe.
[08:03.44]I like... I'm a ranged Andy.
[08:05.90]I like the ranged stuff.
[08:08.00]Okay, yeah, I'm John Switch Axe then.
[08:11.14]Because I liked ranged in... Which one was it?
[08:14.68]Monster Hunter 3U, I think it was?
[08:16.35]And I did, like, Bow and Arrow.
[08:18.57]But now I do Switch Axe and Charge Blade.
[08:22.64]I'm actually curious how many weapons are in the game.
[08:26.96]Yeah, I'm kind of... I'm also curious to see if there's anything similar to the Switch Axe, because that's like... Alright, I got to stop doing that.
[08:32.94]There's like big chunky weapons.
[08:34.44]Do I have any heals left?
[08:37.14]I think I'm out of... No, I got one more.
[08:41.23]You can always like... I think you can also grab more from the environment.
[08:45.63]Oh, right, right, right.
[08:46.13]Cool.
[08:46.71]There's like several just chilling.
[08:49.98]God damn it.
[08:50.92]Wrong button.
[08:51.58]We could have used the crates more.
[08:54.06]Yeah, they did 100 damage earlier from the crates.
[08:57.61]Are you fat rolling?
[09:02.11]I actually might be.
[09:05.06]Is there such a thing?
[09:08.46]I will say, chat, the mechanics of the gameplay feel solid.
[09:15.52]It actually does feel pretty polished in regards to hitting the monster in the face.
[09:20.58]Almost dead.
[09:23.08]Cool.
[09:23.44]We're almost done with tutorial monsters.
[09:26.33]If you need more healing against the trees, there's green bulbs.
[09:31.41]Oh, wait, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[09:33.61]I only have four more of these.
[09:34.67]You have to collect, like, dust.
[09:37.43]There you go.
[09:37.91]Right there.
[09:39.83]I got it.
[09:41.19]These ones.
[09:41.59]Oh, yeah.
[09:43.78]There we go.
[09:46.04]I don't know how much crafting is the focus of the game.
[09:51.30]Vinny!
[09:51.50]Vinny!
[09:51.72]What?
[09:52.94]What are you doing?
[09:53.90]Oh.
[09:54.44]Oh, sorry.
[09:55.34]I just got carried away for a second.
[09:58.84]Yeah, we already made our characters before starting the stream.
[10:01.62]Yeah, I spent three minutes making the character.
[10:04.22]I didn't work too hard on it.
[10:06.04]It was like default plus like three edits.
[10:09.24]I was good with that.
[10:09.92]He's very angry.
[10:16.26]The thing's bouncing around on its ball.
[10:17.70]There we go.
[10:18.41]Oh, there we go.
[10:22.49]What did you just do?
[10:23.71]There we go.
[10:24.81]Oh, I jumped off the crate.
[10:26.09]Did 100 damage.
[10:29.09]I can't wait to make fun.
[10:29.63]By the way, Vinny and Jerma were born in the same year.
[10:31.66]Are we?
[10:32.50]Literally 1985.
[10:32.88]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[10:34.54]Some chat member.
[10:35.18]Oh, shit.
[10:35.62]Yeah, yeah.
[10:37.14]I didn't know we were that.
[10:37.96]Yeah, that's cool.
[10:39.66]Yeah, what month?
[10:40.94]You just had a birthday, right?
[10:42.15]No, I'm September.
[10:44.97]Oh, okay.
[10:45.93]Boy, time goes quick, doesn't it?
[10:47.17]Time does.
[10:48.05]I really feel like that's the case, though.
[10:51.85]2023 feels like it started like a week ago.
[10:53.27]It's fucked up.
[10:54.02]Yeah, it's crazy.
[10:56.48]and like there's already been like a ton of games to play I don't even have like time in my life to play this many video games alright dragon over here I gotta land that at least once I'm doing it again like why did its tail get oh oh there you go uh did you get it we got it nice I wonder where's the weak point
[11:25.29]No, I would see the... Probably the head, right?
[11:27.79]Or like the big bulb.
[11:28.55]Big bulb tail.
[11:30.07]I'm going for the tail.
[11:31.21]I've been going for the tail.
[11:31.95]I've been trying to get that thing off.
[11:37.00]Watch out!
[11:39.16]Oh, big swing.
[11:41.08]That was a very gamer watch out of you.
[11:45.90]I want to see the weapons.
[11:46.66]I want to get to it.
[11:47.54]I'm very curious.
[11:49.28]Yeah, me too.
[11:54.53]If you have no weapon on, you can do a dash slide.
[11:58.31]It's pretty helpful.
[11:58.99]Oh, yeah.
[12:01.83]Jerm, I think... Dead?
[12:04.05]I think we got it.
[12:05.17]No?
[12:07.55]No.
[12:08.72]Oh, it's still alive.
[12:11.82]It's mad.
[12:12.20]It's extra mad.
[12:15.10]It can spawn a tree?
[12:16.38]Do you ever get so angry that you conjured a tree?
[12:24.13]I like the fact that he can ride on the ball.
[12:26.07]That's weird.
[12:26.75]Maybe it hurts.
[12:29.19]I mean, usually it does.
[12:30.37]Oh my God, I have no.
[12:36.03]Jesus.
[12:39.45]I'm unconscious.
[12:40.47]Yeah, just mash mash buttons.
[12:50.08]Wait, did you drop something?
[12:50.66]Someone said, someone said, what the fuck is going on?
[12:52.90]Hey, grab, grab, grab.
[12:54.22]Hey, over here.
[12:55.04]There's an item.
[12:56.75]Rage Tail Fang.
[12:57.55]I think you cut it off.
[12:59.77]Oh.
[13:01.33]Oh, I got it.
[13:03.83]Okay.
[13:03.93]Get your head in the game.
[13:05.05]I know, I know.
[13:05.49]What does it look like?
[13:07.15]We're just a couple of dudes hunting a giant, like, angry rat.
[13:13.89]Those cubes, you just do so much more damage.
[13:16.35]Yeah, you do.
[13:16.85]Alright, right in the head.
[13:22.51]There you go.
[13:26.32]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[13:26.90]Finish it.
[13:27.88]You want me to do it?
[13:28.34]You can do it.
[13:29.10]Yeah, you do it.
[13:31.16]Look at your face.
[13:33.18]I forgot he looked like this.
[13:38.27]Now stay down.
[13:39.71]That's it.
[13:40.05]Why am I saying this to you?
[13:42.51]What's the chef cooking up this time?
[13:44.63]See, that's how you do it.
[13:45.73]Why am I saying that stuff?
[13:47.37]Now stay down.
[13:48.11]That's it then.
[13:50.36]There you go.
[13:53.67]Hang on, let me increase the volume of Jeremy, because... You can conjure springs?
[14:03.16]Wait, can you make... Can we make, like, a bunch of, like... Can we do, like, a bunch of, like, Minecraft piston stuff?
[14:11.07]Hold on a minute.
[14:12.43]Kind of looks like it.
[14:14.19]This thing's going crazy.
[14:17.79]yeah it just propels you forward alright that's the crates you can you can jump up oh I gotta get my carve I didn't even get the carve is there a carve I think we just got it did you get that screen did you get a like a game oh you did a completed screen with all the uh oh okay yeah yeah yeah but I didn't see this stuff because I was I was looking at the chat alright now we gotta make sure the woman back safe is uh the woman back at camp is safe
[14:45.95]um oh we go back to camp yeah so I see it it's the yeah the icon yeah it's really it's convenient when you're a streamer and you can just blame chat whenever you don't see something it's like no I was looking at chat you're going on here we said I unironically want this game yeah I mean it seems pretty fun
[15:18.33]I like how everything has to be like, sorry, everything has some layer of irony on the internet.
[15:24.25]So it's like, it's good to clarify.
[15:28.55]Just in case.
[15:30.13]You never know when there's irony on the internet.
[15:32.37]Some people don't use Kappas.
[15:35.69]How's performance been?
[15:37.36]Performance has been pretty good for me.
[15:39.68]There's a little bit of slowdown on some of the new loading areas, but at least from what you're seeing here so far, it seems pretty good.
[15:46.42]How about you?
[15:47.00]Yeah, it hasn't been too bad.
[15:48.44]I'll tell you what.
[15:50.26]Earlier in the tutorial, I had a couple spots
[15:53.06]I think there's a big patch on the way too, which that would be nice.
[15:57.51]But I turned down like one or two settings and it's been mostly okay.
[16:03.39]I feel like once it loads a new area, you just run kind of smooth.
[16:08.60]But yeah, like, you know, it's a new game.
[16:13.86]I'm moving around a lot.
[16:14.66]I mean, I don't seem to have that many issues.
[16:19.56]Not saying that people don't have issues, right?
[16:26.42]So I guess we talk to her.
[16:29.47]You're a hunter?
[16:35.31]I do have to admit, um, I skipped a third of the cutscenes, so I kind of don't know what's happening.
[16:41.86]Oh, I skipped all of them.
[16:43.00]Oh, no, because we were like, oh, let's get, we gotta get in a game together, let's test the multiplayer.
[16:46.46]Mm-hmm.
[16:46.60]I have, like, an idea of what's going on.
[16:48.94]That's my character, yeah.
[16:58.50]You look kind of cool.
[17:00.48]I guess.
[17:01.90]I was like, default, default, default, change one thing.
[17:05.36]Oh, you did default everything?
[17:08.00]Well, a single look saves a hundred questions, as they say.
[17:12.21]Come with me.
[17:19.15]Okay, so... Big monster destroyed the bridge.
[17:23.55]You can see all of our Tetris pieces.
[17:25.82]That's where Minato is.
[17:28.48]It must have collapsed with that big tremor before.
[17:31.81]By the way, your placement of your blocks is fucking awful.
[17:34.35]That scared the kimono and made it jump out in front of us.
[17:38.95]Spread them out a little more, moron.
[17:40.63]I have to find Ujishige-san.
[17:46.94]Who?
[17:48.48]He only came with me because I insisted.
[17:51.74]Wait.
[17:53.58]Wait, you can see when I skip the dialog?
[17:55.32]Yeah.
[17:56.65]Oh wait, can I?
[17:58.71]Are you skipping her now?
[18:00.33]A little bit.
[18:00.89]Oh, it's a monster.
[18:09.74]Oh, I just turned the audio off.
[18:12.44]Okay, so she's a blacksmith and she can help us get weapons.
[18:16.98]So we're going to get weapons now, I think.
[18:18.88]Also, I do have to bring this up because this is a good feature.
[18:25.31]You and I are just in the game together.
[18:27.63]Let's see what happens here.
[18:33.65]It's not like, oh, we have to join this lobby and then that lobby.
[18:36.77]I think we're just in the game permanently.
[18:39.31]Okay.
[18:40.43]So, oh yeah, there I see you.
[18:41.89]I see the chef, but I'm like... Oh, I have to return to... So wait, you're not escorting this person?
[18:53.88]So, okay, that's interesting.
[18:55.40]You were at camp while I was busy doing the cutscene.
[18:57.52]Oh yeah, there you are.
[18:59.98]Yeah.
[19:00.28]Wow.
[19:00.70]So maybe it just puts me at the camp when you're... If a cutscene's activated?
[19:03.22]Okay.
[19:05.18]Hold on.
[19:06.76]Open your info screen and select...
[19:10.78]uh oh there's a map okay turn your face came on I told you if you go I'll turn it on don't threaten them with a good time
[19:21.62]Okay, here we go.
[19:22.10]So you have like a tree.
[19:24.00]Types of Karakuri.
[19:25.42]You can use the kimono orbs that you obtain by hunting kimono to awaken new types of Karakuri or strengthen Karakuri you've already awakened.
[19:36.04]Knowledge of certain Karakuri cannot be awakened using kimono orbs.
[19:38.83]Instead, you need a flash of inspiration in the midst of hunting a particular kimono or some other hunting success to unlock such Karakuri secrets and conjure them for the first time.
[19:47.71]So there's like a tree.
[19:49.21]Okay, so this is the one we've been using.
[19:51.10]It's it's massive.
[19:52.34]If you scroll all the way down, like hold X and scroll all the way down.
[19:56.62]It's my god.
[19:59.54]What is going on?
[20:03.39]What?
[20:04.65]So I thought that was it wasn't repeating.
[20:08.89]that's a lot of whatever that is I guess because this game um it looks like this game's feature or one of its features to set itself apart is that you can like actually build your camp the way you want to oh yeah okay cool so yo that's a lot right now I have an anvil I can make myself useful
[20:30.74]Make what?
[20:32.32]Make what?
[20:35.32]I didn't hear it.
[20:39.56]Oh, sorry.
[20:41.86]I think she said bow?
[20:44.62]Sword?
[20:45.14]She's going to take apart the katana.
[20:47.18]It's time, Vinny.
[20:48.77]You have to choose your weapon.
[20:52.39]I know.
[20:52.73]I want a switch axe.
[20:54.23]If there's no switch axe, then I'll take the biggest, dumbest object I can use.
[20:57.63]Forging.
[21:01.81]I have a weapon forged.
[21:06.51]Oh, man.
[21:07.47]This is like, look at this.
[21:08.85]Oh, here they are.
[21:10.91]Well, we can't get all of them right now.
[21:12.83]It's like... I think you have to do some stuff.
[21:15.77]Alright, but what do I want?
[21:19.89]Katana.
[21:21.79]Nadachi.
[21:22.55]Bow.
[21:23.09]Maul.
[21:23.73]Bladed.
[21:24.25]Wagasa.
[21:25.55]What is that?
[21:26.04]An umbrella.
[21:29.27]Yeah, it's an umbrella.
[21:30.67]Hello.
[21:31.51]Hey.
[21:33.89]Hey, what do you think?
[21:36.13]What are you into?
[21:37.79]I'll let you choose first.
[21:38.79]And then I'll just I'll choose second because I'm just happy to be here.
[21:45.58]You know, I'm just happy to be here.
[21:47.22]Vinny, you are.
[21:47.68]You are.
[21:47.90]You're the best.
[21:56.17]Thanks, man.
[21:56.77]Well, I mean, thank you for, you know, getting me the game and stuff.
[22:00.03]Appreciate it.
[22:01.72]Vinny's a good dude.
[22:02.36]Alright.
[22:03.80]So what do you... I think I'm... Should I do the... I usually would go... I'd probably... I'd go Maul.
[22:11.02]Either Maul or Go.
[22:11.68]I mean, I'll just... I'll probably do the Nodachi then because it's like a big sword.
[22:17.28]I want to be like Cloud from Final Fantasy VII.
[22:21.15]Maybe I should do... What do I want to do?
[22:25.78]What do you guys think?
[22:28.06]Wagasa or Maul?
[22:30.54]Can we get a poll?
[22:32.88]I'll do either one.
[22:33.48]It looks like you can already upgrade it too.
[22:36.98]Once you get your first one, you have the choice of the weapon tree.
[22:42.63]Because we killed that rat.
[22:44.73]And we could use the rat's bones and gore and organs and spleen.
[22:49.69]And stuff.
[22:52.23]Umbrella now.
[22:53.01]Umbrella now.
[22:55.39]You know what?
[22:59.43]Alright.
[23:00.55]I'll do the Wagasa.
[23:05.54]Chat, this is a tough choice.
[23:06.62]I don't know which one I want to go.
[23:08.32]Oh, yeah.
[23:12.78]We already can do this.
[23:13.81]Alright.
[23:14.61]Critical Master or Savage.
[23:15.91]I don't know what Savage is.
[23:20.03]Oh, goodness.
[23:20.79]Okay.
[23:21.59]This is a lot of options.
[23:24.58]Yeah, it's skill details.
[23:26.64]So, Savage increases attack.
[23:28.12]You can press Y. Critical Master boosts the chance of critical strike.
[23:32.26]So, I'm going to go for my critical sword.
[23:35.48]I don't have the materials to do the other one.
[23:37.24]So, I think we're both going to do the critical one.
[23:39.54]Okay.
[23:40.74]Although, you can wait and go this other path.
[23:46.39]There's that left path too.
[23:49.77]I might as well do more damage.
[23:50.68]Okay, I got big sword and then armor too.
[23:55.86]I don't know if we can make armor.
[24:00.70]So yeah, they all have their own individual trees.
[24:02.47]That's cool.
[24:03.55]I mean, it's nice visually.
[24:05.83]I'm going to get the gauntlets.
[24:07.97]I think this is just teaching us how to do this.
[24:12.08]Yeah.
[24:16.10]Very cool.
[24:18.33]Alright, let me see your weapon.
[24:20.43]Ooh.
[24:20.91]Can you charge it?
[24:29.49]Big energy.
[24:31.31]Like I can just like unleash energy.
[24:34.91]Wait, I have a hop.
[24:38.39]That's cool.
[24:40.62]Umbrella is amazing.
[24:43.38]What happens when you hold ZR or R2?
[24:47.17]I spin it.
[24:47.77]I think it's a block.
[24:49.51]Or like a parry.
[24:50.96]Okay.
[24:52.14]Okay.
[24:58.97]It is a parry.
[24:59.53]Alright.
[24:59.73]That's cool.
[25:01.95]The problem with... The problem with me is I keep trying to press R and R2 to attack.
[25:08.14]Yeah.
[25:08.90]All the Elden Ring.
[25:09.80]All the... Every... All the FromSoftware games are... Yeah.
[25:14.16]Alright.
[25:15.18]We... Oh, make a plan for the hunt around the campfire.
[25:19.47]You want to make a plan?
[25:22.93]Yeah.
[25:23.29]I unlocked something else, though.
[25:24.53]Let's see if I can figure that out.
[25:27.25]I unlocked a...
[25:29.95]So we got a drying rack for food.
[25:33.15]Let's make some steaks.
[25:34.97]And I also got a hunting tower that uses celestial thread to seek out kimono in the wilderness.
[25:43.33]Sends out pulses from the turret to use as echoes that return the chart.
[25:47.35]Okay, so we can find monsters.
[25:48.74]This should do it.
[25:52.44]Okay, so when you sit down at the campfire is when you decide on what you want to do next.
[25:56.32]Okay.
[25:57.46]Okay.
[25:59.26]From the map, you can take on quests or travel instantly to camps and other places out in the wilderness.
[26:03.36]Quests come about when the people of Minato make requests of you and your hunting skills, or when there's a kimono threat that needs it.
[26:09.42]So we can kind of port around.
[26:12.30]Some can be taken as many times as you like, right?
[26:15.55]Okay, so I think there's like story missions, there's other missions, but I think we can just do it from together from the campfire.
[26:23.17]Okay.
[26:24.67]So yeah, I see more Rage Tales, but... I don't know.
[26:29.88]It's up to you.
[26:30.44]Do you want to go for another Rage Tale or do you want to... I don't know how we find new monsters.
[26:35.30]I think we can do Rage Tale again if we want to, but... We talk to her for another one?
[26:41.44]Yeah.
[26:42.74]You want to do it?
[26:44.34]Yeah, let's do it.
[26:48.47]Okay.
[26:49.27]Actually, you might have to do it because you're the host.
[26:51.85]Oh, that's right.
[26:52.45]Okay.
[26:55.81]so wait what happens when you um do you watch this or you're just like running around looking at nothing no I can see it okay okay there's a weapon later in the game that's basically the charge blade switchaxe thing you're looking for that means you'll have to get the better of it in battle first is that something you're ready to do
[27:21.21]The monster design is actually very good.
[27:24.63]I like the little raffia.
[27:26.11]It looks like they put like... Truthfully, they put a lot of like budget into making things look cool.
[27:30.33]Someone said crisis looks better.
[27:48.20]What do you know about design?
[27:50.66]My brother in crisis.
[27:51.78]That is a 20-year-old game.
[27:53.08]Somebody just said, what do you know about design?
[27:56.44]I don't know.
[27:57.42]I just think the games.
[27:58.56]I just play games.
[27:59.48]I don't know.
[27:59.94]Alright.
[28:03.63]Sap scourge.
[28:04.81]So we're going after the sap.
[28:05.69]Are we prepared?
[28:09.35]Yeah.
[28:10.29]I feel like the preparation is less than we would expect, maybe.
[28:14.77]But let me talk to her again.
[28:16.27]Hang on.
[28:18.54]yeah but it's I'm ready yeah we can we can just start fighting like do we have to remove these or are they just all permanently here they're just still here
[28:32.98]Oh.
[28:33.38]Yeah, why are they still here?
[28:34.51]That's weird.
[28:35.05]I think they're permanent.
[28:36.37]You have to be very... Maybe you can take them down.
[28:38.99]Do you have enough healing, like, juice?
[28:41.69]Um... Wait, if you conjure a hunting tower, you'll be able to detect kimono in the surrounding area.
[28:49.01]Yeah, I got one of those.
[28:50.23]I did one of those.
[28:55.88]Oh, I think it wants us to make it.
[28:59.02]Oh, I can catch the snake.
[29:00.98]I just caught a snake.
[29:03.64]campfire where's hunting tower wait do you see the enemy alright so the game is telling us to go down the tree in your karakuri tree and unlock the hunting tower it's like a radar okay because I I have the monster on my uh ui I can see it through the wall too alright um did you see that little fella
[29:28.94]Where?
[29:30.08]This little fella here.
[29:31.42]Oh, I see.
[29:33.44]Refriend.
[29:33.90]Hunter aids.
[29:36.28]You can enhance them at campfires.
[29:38.03]I think those are like cats.
[29:44.95]Did you collect them?
[29:46.85]yeah I think you you collect them and then you can use them to like tank hits from giant rats so that you don't you don't die and they do something like that make changes to them okay cool I think we have to upgrade our menu at least down to the tower how did you know how to do that in your menu go to the karakuri menu it's like to the right and then hunting tower what does this actually do field forge
[30:18.53]Oh, I think we can build stuff out in the wilderness.
[30:22.73]Okay, that's cool.
[30:24.63]We can build a tower here.
[30:27.35]Yeah, so I guess this is... Seek out kimono in the wilderness.
[30:30.91]It sounds out pulses from the turret and uses the echoes that returned to chart the lay of the land and locate... I think it's like you can get map reveal with it.
[30:38.81]Yeah, I built one at base and... I'll build another one here and see if this does anything, but... This should do it.
[30:48.58]It's already in operation, it says.
[30:51.97]Oh, there it is.
[30:52.47]Okay.
[30:53.53]Yeah, I don't know.
[30:56.45]So, I think this just kind of sits on the map.
[30:59.69]Maybe it beeps when it detects something nearby.
[31:03.61]Oh, we just follow the thread.
[31:04.77]If you hold L2, it just shows you a path to the enemy.
[31:09.65]I got full heals.
[31:11.51]Okay.
[31:16.23]There it is.
[31:16.61]Is this on iPad?
[31:18.03]Um, no.
[31:19.03]It's not.
[31:20.35]What the fuck is that?
[31:21.61]Look up.
[31:21.89]Do you see that?
[31:22.21]Oh god, there's two of them.
[31:23.25]Oh god.
[31:23.79]Why is there two?
[31:27.32]Why?
[31:27.74]Okay.
[31:28.20]Well.
[31:28.62]These days, monster games need to have at least two.
[31:33.26]Alright, let's go.
[31:33.82]Alright.
[31:37.49]Oh boy.
[31:38.05]I wonder how the parry works.
[31:40.39]It said we can request assistance.
[31:42.12]I guess we could just get like randos to jump in.
[31:44.14]I'm imagining it's probably that.
[31:45.68]Alright, I'm going to build a spring and see what this does.
[31:50.18]I hope that other thing doesn't.
[31:55.98]The other thing is still over there.
[31:57.15]It's hiding.
[31:58.83]Oh boy.
[31:59.59]Are you dead?
[32:00.83]No, almost.
[32:01.57]I'm just healing.
[32:11.85]what are we thinking what are we thinking I'm just gonna put everywhere head head empty alright I might be like annoying but whatever no no no I'm trying I do it you put everything everywhere I just did like 150 damage or more to this thing
[32:34.21]alright that's funny use a spring to dodge oh you put these around to not get okay I get it I get it I get it so you put them in places where you know you can dodge that hurt
[33:01.12]I do like a weird dive.
[33:02.40]I go straight down on the crown of my head.
[33:05.04]I kind of float in the air also.
[33:28.52]Yeah, dude, the amount of damage you do from a tower is insane.
[33:32.46]It's unbelievable.
[33:33.62]It's so good.
[33:34.16]Alright, I figured out how this thing works.
[33:39.70]You want to be in the air.
[33:40.52]Wait, where's he going?
[33:44.34]I think you cut something off over here.
[33:48.16]Did I?
[33:48.66]Okay, hang on.
[33:50.64]Zap, Scourge, Amber.
[33:51.90]I just picked up a weird thing that allows me to build more stuff, I think.
[33:55.48]I don't know.
[33:57.22]Hold R, T, and X to build your meter faster and then release R, T for a charged attack, says a chat member.
[34:04.07]Helpful.
[34:05.25]Today we have helpful chat members.
[34:07.07]I didn't know.
[34:11.39]Where did that monster go?
[34:14.72]Alright, we got a marker.
[34:16.52]Yeah, we got a marker.
[34:17.12]There's a rage tail behind us, but yeah, let's just mark it.
[34:20.54]Oh, no.
[34:22.25]Oh, that's a turtle.
[34:31.57]Chat, I get it.
[34:32.37]You're trying to get me to say the forbidden words.
[34:34.29]I'm not going to say them.
[34:35.39]He's just like wiped his eyes.
[34:39.09]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, look, look, look.
[34:43.16]Yes.
[34:43.66]What?
[34:44.20]Just one of those friends.
[34:46.42]Oh, okay.
[34:46.92]I'll grab one.
[34:47.40]Okay.
[34:53.36]I need the bear at the camp allows you to train and see all the combos you can do.
[34:56.83]Interesting.
[34:58.45]Yeah, that's the way you work it.
[34:59.63]That's the way you go for it.
[35:04.89]Put down some of those tools and just bounce off them and jump in the air and stuff.
[35:10.21]Okay.
[35:14.30]Oh.
[35:24.69]It rolls around.
[35:27.71]Oh, I gotta collect that.
[35:28.45]Ah, wrong thing.
[35:31.13]Wrong button.
[35:31.55]It's real.
[35:35.59]Ah!
[35:36.77]It came to me.
[35:39.57]Dude.
[35:39.91]Yeah, you fly in the air.
[35:40.87]I like that.
[35:41.31]This weapon's actually pretty fun.
[35:46.79]stuff what rolls around comes around I guess so yeah the swordsman too what's the thing around his left leg like a blue thing uh I don't know is it like a see a wonderful spot
[36:14.28]Yeah, that's weird.
[36:14.93]I don't know what that is.
[36:17.61]Damn it.
[36:20.39]I want to try the parry.
[36:21.11]I'm going to try parry.
[36:22.73]Let's see what happens.
[36:24.19]Wait, is that specific to your weapon?
[36:26.05]Oh, it is.
[36:26.43]It is.
[36:26.65]I think so.
[36:27.53]I wonder how it works.
[36:31.50]Wait, I think we did enough damage.
[36:32.78]It's running.
[36:37.82]Alright, use springs.
[36:39.06]Quick.
[36:44.22]I mean, they help a little bit.
[36:46.86]We are just fucking up this whole area though.
[36:49.39]These are going to be here forever.
[36:51.41]Yeah.
[36:52.75]Like this beautiful area.
[36:54.63]This is a comment on industrialization.
[36:56.83]This game.
[36:59.61]I used all of my breads.
[37:04.81]I know there's more.
[37:06.23]It's like some of the trees maybe.
[37:13.74]Oh, you can slide too.
[37:15.22]Chat member, I swear you've typed that like 18 times since I started.
[37:21.26]Look out for this snake.
[37:22.26]Look at this guy.
[37:22.76]This guy just ran ahead.
[37:23.66]No!
[37:25.33]I need to save this snake so bad.
[37:26.67]Okay, thank God.
[37:27.65]That's like the most concerning thing of the whole game for me so far.
[37:31.85]What's wrong with me?
[37:40.17]Oh, God.
[37:41.06]I got out just in time.
[37:41.94]I'm out of... I gotta get more food.
[37:48.22]He loves animals.
[37:49.58]Yeah, as I kill one right here.
[37:51.89]Yeah.
[37:53.33]And forests.
[37:54.77]We love the forests.
[37:55.75]Keep chopping down the trees.
[37:57.03]I like that move.
[38:07.92]Shoot some sticky, sappy substance.
[38:12.74]Where is he?
[38:13.24]Oh, I'm going to use yours.
[38:18.72]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[38:21.46]It really just does something.
[38:23.68]It's insane.
[38:25.02]And I combo with it.
[38:25.96]I end up doing 100 hits.
[38:32.57]I love the elbow drop that I can do with this thing.
[38:37.76]Okay, I just got really knocked off.
[38:41.48]Uh-oh.
[38:44.14]Uh-oh, Vinny, I might die.
[38:47.04]I'm going to die.
[38:47.70]I'm trying to help.
[38:49.01]I'm trying to get attention.
[38:50.63]What the fuck am I doing?
[38:52.15]Dodge, chef, dodge.
[38:53.61]Oh, okay, okay, okay.
[38:54.45]I just went back into the fire.
[38:55.49]Something's angry.
[39:01.29]Oh, he's angry, Vinny.
[39:03.69]oh boy yeah it's dropping like like oh whatever this is oh sap scourge that's right that's the name whoa whoa look at this hold on can you climb this I'm going off the top rope oh my god it's eating me it's a tree it's a tree and it's eating me how does it have a mouth where you be where are you
[39:27.91]I'm sorry to make all these weird noises.
[39:30.80]No, I'm good.
[39:32.30]It's just this this enemy is literally like a tree creature.
[39:34.96]I didn't even realize that until just now.
[39:37.38]It's taken down the whole forest.
[39:39.10]It's so sappy.
[39:43.80]Jesus.
[39:50.58]Shit, I missed.
[39:52.28]Can you climb trees?
[39:55.40]Not like you can climb the crates, I don't think.
[39:59.00]Those crates were made for climbing.
[40:00.29]And that's just what they'll do.
[40:13.39]Damn it, I keep missing it.
[40:14.31]It's so cool.
[40:15.52]Yeah.
[40:17.08]Same here.
[40:17.44]I'm sorry.
[40:19.66]I keep missing it, and it's so cool.
[40:21.76]I know.
[40:24.42]Grade A commentary.
[40:29.58]Okay.
[40:31.14]I feel like we're in the last phase here.
[40:33.46]We have to be.
[40:34.18]It's angry.
[40:35.24]We've been hitting it.
[40:37.02]There we go.
[40:38.88]We've been sapped upon several times by now.
[40:56.11]Underleveled?
[40:57.39]Oh, he is eating me too.
[41:04.73]Here we go.
[41:05.99]Get damage on now.
[41:10.31]I'm trying to see.
[41:11.05]I know there's like other attacks that you can combo.
[41:14.27]Like I'm seeing in the top right.
[41:15.57]That's hot.
[41:18.49]Go, go, go, go, go, go, go.
[41:20.09]Massive damage.
[41:21.01]Absolutely massive damage from me.
[41:23.79]Get that shit.
[41:35.09]You did 40 DPS.
[41:37.03]I'm doing fine.
[41:45.61]Chat is saying that my graphics look better than your graphics.
[41:49.09]They do?
[41:50.38]I don't know.
[41:51.83]You have to show little bro Jerma your settings as a chat member.
[41:55.43]What are your settings?
[41:58.82]I don't know.
[41:59.28]I have most things on high.
[42:00.78]I got rid of ambient occlusion and motion blur and everything else is on high.
[42:05.06]It looks apparent.
[42:06.02]Chat saying it like my graphics is good.
[42:09.12]My graphics are not good?
[42:10.54]I don't know.
[42:12.28]Look better?
[42:13.70]You have a better GPU than me though.
[42:15.12]I do.
[42:15.38]Yeah.
[42:15.60]You do.
[42:16.50]Does it look better?
[42:18.97]We don't get time for this.
[42:19.59]We gotta hunt the monster.
[42:20.69]Yeah, we gotta- that's right.
[42:32.26]Oh, there's a little fella here.
[42:33.04]I don't know if we can catch it.
[42:34.48]I caught it.
[42:34.78]It's a very bright squirrel.
[42:35.48]They're saying your graphics are wicked crisp.
[42:38.02]Why am I not crisp?
[42:40.06]I didn't apply them?
[42:40.86]Is that chat member from Boston?
[42:45.16]Did you actually say Wicked growing up?
[42:47.02]Was that a regional thing?
[42:48.24]Because we did not have that in New York.
[42:50.22]No one was saying Wicked when I was growing up.
[42:52.36]When Ocarina of Time came out, no one was saying it was a Wicked cool game in New York.
[42:57.49]That was actually a thing, Jerma, that you were saying Wicked?
[43:01.35]I said Wicked all the time, yeah.
[43:06.37]Did you ever hear of herbs?
[43:08.89]Do you like when someone's a herb?
[43:11.48]That, I don't know.
[43:13.78]Okay.
[43:14.44]Is that what you said?
[43:16.58]A little bit of that.
[43:17.63]Or if someone's a skell, do you know skell?
[43:20.17]Skell?
[43:21.33]No.
[43:21.79]Yeah.
[43:22.45]Like if they're, like, a fellow of ill repute is a skell.
[43:28.14]we got we've got a weird we've got like an asparagus dragon over here yeah I don't know what to do boy oh god I'm about to get rolled over I love I'm fighting just like the random shitty enemy and it's an intense fight and you're over there fighting the real monster I'm trying
[44:00.86]Oh, you got it!
[44:01.36]You actually got the tail.
[44:02.28]You can do it!
[44:03.85]It's real.
[44:13.51]Climb it.
[44:14.33]Climb!
[44:16.31]Oh, shit.
[44:16.95]I'm on his back.
[44:19.28]Oh, you can do that in this game?
[44:20.20]Alright, I'm on his back.
[44:20.88]What do I do?
[44:22.00]I don't know.
[44:22.36]Press buttons.
[44:23.36]Alright, I'm pressing buttons.
[44:24.10]Match.
[44:24.86]Match.
[44:27.30]That was quick.
[44:31.03]I'm still fine.
[44:35.65]Come on, Vinny.
[44:36.55]Kill it.
[44:37.59]I don't know.
[44:38.01]How do I thrust?
[44:38.91]Oh.
[44:59.76]I hope there's no damage meter because you're probably doing 80% of all the damage.
[45:04.49]I don't think so, man.
[45:05.41]I'm doing okay, but there are moments where I just don't get any hits for like a minute.
[45:10.05]I hope there's no health bar.
[45:13.47]There usually isn't in these games.
[45:18.25]Yeah, no, you just have to, like, if the monster is, like, limping, or if the monster seems tired or weak, that's how you know you're almost done.
[45:36.03]Definitely almost there.
[45:37.88]We have to be.
[45:38.76]You need to parry to do real damage with this weapon.
[45:40.92]Alright, I'll learn it after this.
[45:42.30]Finish what?
[45:45.74]Oh, wait, this thing's still alive.
[45:49.54]That was kinda sad.
[46:01.05]Oh.
[46:01.57]Oh no.
[46:02.23]Shit.
[46:02.63]I'm gonna try to parry.
[46:05.69]Oh!
[46:05.95]I'm dead.
[46:06.25]I don't know what to do.
[46:08.83]I think I can get you back.
[46:09.89]I think I can get... I'm gonna see.
[46:11.43]Be careful.
[46:16.44]Oh god!
[46:17.30]Oh, it's eating me alive!
[46:22.55]Bro, why are you sad?
[46:26.13]The game is about killing monsters.
[46:30.47]I'm sitting there going like, oh no.
[46:40.46]Oh my goodness.
[46:42.22]You were just in time.
[46:44.32]Died to sap scourge, Omega Lola.
[46:46.12]I'm fine.
[46:55.62]I don't know the combos.
[46:56.78]I would be so much more effective with this weapon if I knew the combos.
[47:01.01]I've got to figure out the parry.
[47:02.55]That's how you get this to work.
[47:03.57]Yeah, for yours, that would probably be amazing.
[47:09.31]Even angrier.
[47:10.46]We are at anger levels never seen before, Vinny.
[47:16.30]Stay alive.
[47:18.18]Keep going.
[47:18.68]Get that sap off of us.
[47:24.68]Ungar Max.
[47:25.38]That's right.
[47:26.56]That's Barret's limit break in Final Fantasy.
[47:29.47]Ungar Max.
[47:31.03]Kill, kill, kill, kill, kill.
[47:31.91]Jarmo, did you ever hear about that?
[47:34.83]What was it?
[47:36.13]There was a mistranslation of Barret's limit break in Final Fantasy VII.
[47:40.52]Oh.
[47:41.34]And they called it Ungar Max when it should have been Anger Max.
[47:45.78]We won.
[47:46.06]I was like a little kid.
[47:47.18]I was like, what's Ungar Max?
[47:48.84]Ungar?
[47:50.18]Yeah, they just mistranslated it.
[47:52.23]Spelled it wrong.
[47:59.11]Alright.
[48:00.61]Ungar.
[48:02.07]Ungar.
[48:04.21]New word every day.
[48:06.77]Flying Vine Karakuri Awaken.
[48:08.93]Oh, that's me.
[48:09.65]Yeah, so one of the big selling points of this game is the fact that you can put... I mean, we're doing these things, but there are a ton of these tools.
[48:19.03]You can put zip lines around.
[48:21.13]I think it's pretty handy to make almost like a little fort in the monster fight area.
[48:27.27]Like at night.
[48:30.00]Well, during the day, too.
[48:31.54]Okay, during the day, too.
[48:32.62]Good, good.
[48:33.74]Your gamma's too high.
[48:34.54]Should I turn my gamma down?
[48:37.42]Turn down your gamma.
[48:39.36]My gamma's so high.
[48:40.18]Is that why the graphics is different?
[48:44.71]I think that's probably what's going on, yeah.
[49:07.08]That explains it.
[49:08.68]She roped you into doing her dirty work for her.
[49:10.98]Turn on ambient occlusion.
[49:11.92]It breaks the shaders if it's off.
[49:15.00]Mine are off too.
[49:16.14]I'll turn mine back on then.
[49:18.62]Weird.
[49:19.52]You made camp, did you?
[49:22.16]In that case, lead the way.
[49:25.22]Much as I like the idea of a statue in my honor, I don't want to give it.
[49:32.35]So this takes place in medieval Japan?
[49:34.77]Yeah, that's what I was thinking.
[49:38.65]Or like some very, I mean, there's monsters.
[49:41.41]Look at this.
[49:42.57]You awaken the flying vine dragon.
[49:44.72]Hold on a minute.
[49:47.16]Did you see that?
[49:48.52]Yeah.
[49:49.48]Let's see if we can make it.
[49:51.76]Instruct your own network of corridors through the wilderness.
[49:54.46]Yeah, that's what I'm saying.
[49:56.20]I think everything is permanent.
[49:57.66]We're supposed to make, essentially, our own permanent resources to travel around.
[50:05.09]Let's see if we can do it.
[50:08.49]Let me do this real quick.
[50:16.63]The tail?
[50:17.47]I think I carved the tail already, chat.
[50:21.51]There would be like a green stink around it if I didn't.
[50:24.95]And I'm pretty sure I got that.
[50:26.24]Oh, that does look better.
[50:33.56]Oh, you know what?
[50:34.50]Let me turn ambient occlusion on too.
[50:35.82]That looks a thousand times better.
[50:40.68]Wow.
[50:42.20]Okay.
[50:42.84]Yeah, they weren't kidding.
[50:43.90]Yeah, this actually looks great.
[50:45.54]I had my gamma up like way too high.
[50:51.16]Alright, cool.
[50:52.70]I'm trying to build the thing, the flying vine thing.
[50:55.64]I think because we're in a cave, we can't.
[50:57.86]Let's get out of this cave and see what happens.
[51:05.14]Oh, I got one.
[51:08.18]You did it?
[51:08.82]Yep.
[51:12.77]Uh...
[51:19.59]Oh, wait.
[51:21.53]Oh, I didn't, I made the wrong thing.
[51:24.41]Wait, did I make the wrong thing?
[51:27.41]Maybe.
[51:27.85]I made like, I made like a fucking, like a crochet.
[51:32.48]Oh, wait, no, I think that's it.
[51:34.26]It's the one all the way to the right, right?
[51:38.51]Vinny, are you not holding A?
[51:43.25]Wait.
[51:43.85]Oh, whoa, whoa, whoa.
[51:44.90]I get it.
[51:45.30]Oops.
[51:45.64]I blew it.
[51:46.28]You gotta hold A. Oh, I blew it big time.
[51:48.70]I get it.
[51:49.00]Okay.
[51:50.72]You have to aim the thing and shoot it.
[51:52.42]I thought it was that we connected together.
[51:53.82]Let me try it.
[52:01.99]Okay.
[52:04.41]Wait, how do I yeet myself?
[52:05.69]Okay.
[52:17.08]You hold, right?
[52:20.28]RBA.
[52:20.94]I pressed that, chat.
[52:22.36]I pressed that.
[52:29.85]Literally tells you.
[52:30.87]I know it tells me, but it's not working.
[52:32.35]RBA.
[52:33.17]Mine was pretty sick.
[52:35.05]Dude, that thing is going like two feet.
[52:36.59]It's fine.
[52:36.89]Oh, you're all the way over there.
[52:41.46]Let me get to you real quick.
[52:43.30]No, there's nothing over here.
[52:45.16]It's fine.
[52:49.59]mean alright that was alright that's cool it's it's cool but it didn't I didn't really build an effective one we need to okay the next monster we fight we have to build a little base around it okay you can teleport to camp from the maps as a chat member oh you can you can oh you can it's useful
[53:14.82]only hosts can do that wait what no no okay I'm good I'm gone oh there you are okay here I'm gonna build one of these the dragon pit isn't powerful enough oh we need more like capacity to build extra stuff I think I'm going to become so compulsive with this because these things are permanent
[53:43.09]Someone said, is this Monster Hunter with Death Stranding?
[53:45.67]There's elements of both.
[53:46.55]Yeah, sure.
[53:47.73]What's up, Jeremy?
[53:48.91]I was going to say, if everything is permanent, I feel like there's a lot of people that are going to make insane travel bases.
[53:56.28]You're going to be able to go anywhere.
[53:57.82]Some of you that get this game.
[54:00.18]And just build networks.
[54:02.74]Yeah, I'm curious about the insane networks people are going to build with all the stuff unlocked.
[54:06.83]I'd be preserved in Amber right now.
[54:10.09]Exposed for all to see.
[54:13.68]You paint a green picture, Ujishige-san.
[54:17.77]It really was fortunate.
[54:20.05]You're right.
[54:20.73]Did you see this one in battle?
[54:23.61]We are facecam imminent, by the way.
[54:25.05]I want to make sure everyone's aware.
[54:27.35]I know.
[54:29.12]Creating Karakuri out of thin air like that?
[54:32.68]That's a skill I simply have to learn.
[54:36.04]We were good.
[54:37.54]We've been good.
[54:38.24]I'd like to get back to Minato before any more kemono take an unhealthy liking to me.
[54:43.19]no I'm not turn I don't know unfortunately oh no yeah not don't wait not you know not you no no my chat's like you should do it too vin I'm like I don't care how good the chat's been I've been uh too lazy for that I've been streaming with it uh with it off recently it's just it's nice because I could sit back in my chair and I can just look like I know not have like light lights on like I can stream in the dark and damage my eyes it's fine I like it
[55:14.44]I was using a Game Boy camera for a while, and that was actually my... Were you actually doing that?
[55:21.31]Not a real one, but I found a way to make it work.
[55:23.69]Oh, that's so funny.
[55:25.03]It was cool.
[55:25.59]What was that?
[55:28.63]Oh, I thought he farted.
[55:30.41]Suburban Sasquatch.
[55:31.13]I was looking over at the chat, and I was just like, what is that?
[55:41.67]Okay, so we're going to eat because that guy's stomach was growling and we have food.
[55:45.84]Alright, there we go.
[55:47.76]It's a very interesting way to sit.
[55:49.54]It's good on the spine.
[55:51.24]Get some nice permanent spine damage.
[55:54.20]Fuck yeah.
[55:54.56]It was just what we all needed.
[55:55.76]Although smithing is about all I...
[56:13.66]That's funny.
[56:16.06]Uh-oh.
[56:19.13]Wait, what's this chat member say?
[56:21.37]Oh, hang on.
[56:22.13]I just tabbed out by accident.
[56:23.47]Chat member, can you repeat that about the audio thing?
[56:32.65]You have to break the dragon vines you place to make more, and two, if you change your audio settings to 5.1, your FPS gets doubled.
[56:39.45]Really?
[56:39.75]5.1?
[56:40.75]Huh.
[56:42.48]Alright, I'll try.
[56:43.08]Let's try it.
[56:48.08]You'll have to do the scouting alone.
[56:50.47]I'd only slow you down.
[56:53.35]My FPS are good.
[56:56.21]I've had stutters a little bit, but nothing terrible.
[56:58.97]Put it on 5.1?
[56:59.19]7.1?
[56:59.21]Yeah.
[56:59.37]7.1, 5.1.
[56:59.65]We'll give it a shot.
[57:14.92]Someone mentioned the audio thing in Critical's chat too.
[57:17.52]Alright, we'll see.
[57:20.23]That actually kind of worked.
[57:27.17]I mean, it was fine before, but... Wait a minute.
[57:31.16]Oh, this is the training thing.
[57:34.04]Did you fight the bear?
[57:34.66]No, not yet.
[57:37.02]I'm going to do that.
[57:39.02]Oh, that's what this is.
[57:40.42]Yeah.
[57:44.34]I have Bunging Comet from Reverse Lunt.
[57:47.37]So you go wham, then you go wham.
[57:50.55]DRG has a similar bug.
[57:51.85]It's with internal EQ.
[57:53.19]Okay, interesting.
[57:56.76]Someone said I could charge this.
[58:00.34]Like, faster.
[58:01.14]What was the charge button?
[58:04.22]I just did 795 damage, Dermot.
[58:07.12]What?
[58:08.06]Hold on a second.
[58:09.26]I was... We were... I was doing like three damage a swing.
[58:13.28]You just did 700 damage?
[58:15.29]Yeah, yeah.
[58:15.79]I did a full charge with the sword and I got that much damage.
[58:18.91]What?
[58:19.41]Okay.
[58:22.77]That's... That's... Yeah.
[58:23.85]That was interesting.
[58:27.01]Oh, I see.
[58:27.71]Okay, with this weapon, I can charge and attack while I'm charging and then unleash a 700 damage attack.
[58:35.72]Crazy.
[58:36.56]Absolutely insane damage.
[58:38.84]Come under attack while in parry stance.
[58:40.58]Hold on.
[58:43.10]I want to bring one of these little fellas with me.
[58:45.96]Is that working?
[58:52.01]Do I have to time it?
[58:52.79]Like...
[59:00.87]Press LT next to the bear.
[59:06.79]Sufficient materials.
[59:09.97]Am I missing something?
[59:11.49]I need to parry it.
[59:14.87]Isn't that- it's not working?
[59:16.51]Parry successfully for big spin dance.
[59:19.95]Oh!
[59:27.99]Okay, so it's not... Wait a minute.
[59:30.43]Alright, it's not the top of the weapon, it's... I get it.
[59:34.76]I'm just stuck in a box.
[59:37.86]You alright?
[59:38.22]Where are you?
[59:39.54]Yeah, I'm fine.
[59:40.18]I'm just equipping stuff in a box.
[59:42.44]So you parry, parry, parry, parry, parry, build up your gauge.
[59:46.05]And then you've got ultra damage.
[59:51.31]This is hard.
[59:52.67]This is tricky.
[59:54.61]You probably chose the most technical weapon.
[59:58.46]Like, by accident.
[59:59.38]That's just now your thing.
[60:02.70]Okay, so during parry, counterattack.
[60:06.89]I'm not caught up with this one.
[60:08.23]I think I have to use the maul.
[60:09.11]I have to use the maul.
[60:14.34]Oh, shit.
[60:15.10]Alright.
[60:15.36]Wait, wait, wait.
[60:19.56]I got a full gauge.
[60:24.31]Vinny, why are you fondling that poor ball?
[60:27.39]Don't... Do not incite ball fondler.
[60:32.28]Do not, like, summon him.
[60:33.66]Whatever you do.
[60:35.08]Okay.
[60:40.09]I think I'm getting it down.
[60:41.31]Now, how much damage does it do?
[60:42.23]Just a...
[60:44.96]Nice.
[60:45.20]Alright.
[60:46.13]Oh, wow.
[60:47.61]I'm doing so much more damage to Swing now.
[60:51.21]Mid dodge attack?
[60:53.88]Nice.
[60:58.24]Okay.
[61:05.77]Oh, this really does just teach you all your combos.
[61:07.79]That's awesome.
[61:08.49]Yeah.
[61:09.83]Alright.
[61:10.23]Oh, my God, dude.
[61:11.05]I was swinging and hitting the back of the bark on the back of that last enemy's back and was doing one damage a swing.
[61:18.56]I'm doing like 100 damage now.
[61:20.02]Nice.
[61:23.06]No wonder I was so useless in that last fight.
[61:25.77]Okay, mount spring, then mid-leap.
[61:36.05]crate-based attack.
[61:37.01]There's a lot of travel attacks, it seems like.
[61:40.80]Yeah.
[61:45.08]I just gotta get the parry down.
[61:48.00]Mount spring and then X mid-leap?
[61:49.96]Wait, you can mount a spring?
[61:51.46]Oh, I see what it means.
[61:57.45]Okay, so you have to spring into the enemy and then attack.
[62:00.45]Cool.
[62:05.41]So I'm imagining that if... Chat, help me out here.
[62:08.33]When my gauge is higher, I do more damage, obviously.
[62:11.87]I mean, obviously.
[62:21.67]Nah.
[62:23.15]Cool.
[62:23.87]Yeah, now it looks like we both know how to play the game now.
[62:26.23]Yeah.
[62:26.43]So that's good.
[62:27.97]We both got it down?
[62:28.85]Yeah.
[62:34.99]What about these little guys?
[62:36.94]Yeah, so I just upgraded that little dude.
[62:39.28]I don't know what it does exactly, but, you know, you can, like, um, I think you can carry more stuff for crates.
[62:46.58]That seemed to be, like, what happened.
[62:50.18]You lose the gauge very quick when taking damage or not fighting anyone.
[62:58.34]Attack form?
[63:01.72]Charmander, there's food, too.
[63:03.38]You can dry your meat, and then it'll give you attack and health bonuses and stuff.
[63:09.05]I just learned.
[63:09.55]Ooh, let's do it.
[63:15.23]Find out what creature made the roar.
[63:18.27]Ooh.
[63:18.61]Okay.
[63:21.79]Dry ingredients.
[63:24.43]Oh, this is what you were talking about.
[63:29.55]Drama is this woman stuck in a box for you to whenever whenever you're over there um I'll check it out in a sec.
[63:36.24]Yeah, yeah, no rush cubed meat uh I'm just drying a bunch of meat Luigi I'm stuck in a little box.
[63:49.41]It's me Mario.
[63:50.23]I need you to get me out of here I'm just drying some meat
[63:56.46]Mario, what are you doing in the box?
[63:58.62]I'm in the box too!
[63:59.22]He is there!
[64:00.36]What are you doing in there?
[64:01.26]Get out of there!
[64:03.06]That's dangerous!
[64:04.71]Someone just said you're embarrassing us.
[64:06.79]Me?
[64:08.23]I'm embarrassing myself, not you, chat.
[64:11.47]No, no, no, I don't think... You don't get embarrassed here.
[64:16.03]Do you understand the things that I've said?
[64:19.18]Yeah, I know, I know.
[64:20.52]Don't worry.
[64:22.80]We are all collectively weird here.
[64:24.56]Don't worry.
[64:24.96]Yes, that's fair.
[64:27.84]Alright, let's make, hold on.
[64:28.88]Let's make one of those.
[64:29.40]I'm going to make one of these things and you're going to see how cool it is.
[64:31.42]Ready?
[64:32.90]Yeah.
[64:33.10]Check this shit out.
[64:35.02]Now, before you do that though, Jerma, I have a, there's a sign over here that you can place.
[64:39.67]It was, it's, there's a weird message on it.
[64:42.29]Really?
[64:43.35]Yeah.
[64:43.55]Yeah.
[64:43.75]Check this out.
[64:47.67]It's weird.
[64:48.15]Like I just read, I was like, how, how did that sign get there?
[64:51.93]Like, why does it say that?
[64:53.49]This one.
[64:53.97]Let me investigate.
[64:54.65]Hold on.
[64:55.74]Yeah.
[64:55.94]Yeah.
[64:57.92]Right here.
[64:58.50]Yep.
[65:06.82]Alright, you want to go hunt a monster now?
[65:13.42]Really?
[65:15.78]Really?
[65:18.52]On a sponsor stream, Vinny?
[65:19.74]Alright, we need to make that a... Speaking of sponsor, thank you EA for sponsoring the stream.
[65:26.98]The game is out right now.
[65:28.54]It is Wild Hearts.
[65:29.90]You can get it on PlayStation 5, Xbox Series X, and Series S as well as PC.
[65:36.50]That was the best time to possibly do that.
[65:38.22]If you're into the monster hunting kind of lifestyle, this is potentially the game for you.
[65:49.38]Weirdly enough, that switching audio thing actually increased my performance by quite a bit.
[65:54.48]I mean, I would say that what I'm looking at right now, yeah, I would call it beautiful.
[66:00.44]Like a marginal difference, yeah.
[66:01.96]Really?
[66:02.44]Really?
[66:02.66]During my sponsored stream?
[66:05.70]Really?
[66:07.58]Unbelievable.
[66:08.14]Oh my god.
[66:14.58]And Vinny killed him.
[66:17.02]I had to, had to.
[66:19.04]So, how do we get up there?
[66:19.88]Wait, oh shit, I forgot about, I wasted stuff.
[66:23.16]Alright, you ready Vinny?
[66:25.20]Check this out.
[66:25.86]Yeah.
[66:26.38]We're gonna make this happen.
[66:27.24]Okay.
[66:28.60]I don't have enough resources, you need to make one.
[66:31.43]Make what?
[66:32.71]Oh, we need to tear that down.
[66:33.89]Hold on, come back over here.
[66:35.09]I'm just getting smacked by a goat.
[66:37.49]By a fantasy goat.
[66:38.53]Hang on.
[66:39.19]I'll just take care of this.
[66:40.07]Alright.
[66:44.30]I think we can only make a certain amount of objects.
[66:49.13]Correct, yeah.
[66:50.47]So if we have too many, we should probably remove some.
[66:55.43]Right?
[66:56.67]Can I do that?
[67:00.25]You can dismantle from the menu, I think.
[67:03.03]Oh, wait.
[67:11.31]How do we do that?
[67:16.56]Because it says, uh, dragon pit isn't powerful enough.
[67:19.80]And see dragon pit capacity?
[67:21.22]We're at kind of minus 13 right now.
[67:24.05]Or that.
[67:24.67]Or two.
[67:25.01]Hold L1 and press up.
[67:29.75]Oh, dismantle.
[67:30.25]There it is.
[67:31.89]Yep.
[67:32.15]You press the right stick in.
[67:35.79]I found another sign, Jerma.
[67:37.19]It's weird.
[67:38.85]Another one.
[67:41.79]Wait, you got another sign?
[67:43.01]Let me see.
[67:43.82]What's on it?
[67:44.60]No, no, no.
[67:45.14]You're good.
[67:45.48]You're good.
[67:47.63]Not during your sponsored stream.
[67:49.09]Check this out.
[67:51.23]We are going to make a zip line from here to there.
[67:53.75]To the mountain?
[67:54.75]Okay.
[67:55.05]Because my zip line is placed in a very inconvenient area, and I think I'd have to go over to it and dismantle it.
[68:00.38]Fuck it.
[68:00.98]We have so much shit everywhere.
[68:02.34]I can't build it.
[68:05.66]Looks like we're walking.
[68:12.51]Oh, wait, wait, wait.
[68:13.33]What if we touch the dragon pit here?
[68:17.38]Do you have a small mist crystal by chance?
[68:19.58]Do you still want to eat shit?
[68:21.68]No.
[68:22.12]No, no, don't do that.
[68:23.78]Jerm, over here, can you touch this dragon pit?
[68:28.05]Because if you do that, we can then build more stuff in this area.
[68:31.37]Only hosts can do that.
[68:33.51]God damn it.
[68:34.63]Can you do it?
[68:36.21]I can't because I'm missing a small mist crystal.
[68:38.73]Wait.
[68:40.81]Maybe I have one.
[68:45.96]Small mist crystal?
[68:46.50]Sunset looks nice.
[68:50.82]Wait, this might be it right here.
[68:53.46]No, that's crystal ore.
[68:54.80]I have a shitload of them.
[68:56.12]Can I give them to you?
[68:56.74]Open your crafting and hit right stick and you can dismantle the boxes.
[69:02.89]Alright, so if you do that... Oh, wrong button.
[69:06.29]So if you do that, right... And then you can make it huge so you can just get rid of everything.
[69:16.98]Alright, at least you can do that.
[69:24.70]Wait, how do you dismiss... Oh.
[69:25.76]Nice.
[69:29.15]Okay.
[69:29.43]Okay, can you... Can you build the thing now?
[69:32.21]The zipline?
[69:33.11]Like, I'm really... I cannot.
[69:35.35]I'm really dedicated to the zipline idea.
[69:37.47]No?
[69:38.37]I cannot build it.
[69:43.13]I can build this other stuff, though.
[69:45.15]So we only have... Okay, so we have two of that capacity on the top row.
[69:50.82]I think, honestly, I'm going to be honest with you.
[69:52.88]I think I built like four of them when we were testing it.
[69:55.50]They're all in that place.
[69:57.46]I wonder if I can do it from the... Do we have to go dismantle them?
[70:02.07]Get rid of the poop sign.
[70:04.31]Someone said for me to get rid of the poop sign.
[70:06.07]Okay.
[70:07.59]Or you might have to go back to the old one.
[70:08.97]Alright, let me get rid of the poop sign.
[70:10.31]We'll try then.
[70:10.92]Oh, I got a small mist crystal.
[70:14.58]Hang on.
[70:14.90]I think that's exactly what I needed.
[70:16.70]We need more leaps.
[70:19.58]Can't hurt.
[70:21.71]You can now conjure more dragon Karakuri here.
[70:24.67]So now I think we can do it, maybe.
[70:29.13]I think it's not quite.
[70:32.53]I think you only have two out of a larger capacity.
[70:34.53]You don't have enough resources.
[70:35.67]Alright, we just need to get resources.
[70:39.15]Let's try to get our way over there then.
[70:40.13]A long way.
[70:41.45]We need one more.
[70:42.01]Alright.
[70:43.29]Oh, wait.
[70:43.57]No, I can do it now.
[70:44.21]I can do it.
[70:45.31]Oh, you can?
[70:45.71]Alright, nice.
[70:46.43]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[70:47.63]So now if you put it here, can you just aim it to the top of that cliff and can we just ride it up?
[70:52.05]Yeah, I'm gonna try.
[70:55.67]So how do we make the zipline part?
[70:57.89]Now you get on top of it and you fire it wherever you want.
[71:00.52]I think it's left trigger to activate it.
[71:07.14]And then you aim it and you're trying to get it.
[71:10.39]And look at that!
[71:12.73]Go.
[71:14.29]Oh my god.
[71:14.79]We did it.
[71:16.57]Why are you faster than me?
[71:18.07]You shouldn't be faster than me.
[71:19.43]I don't know.
[71:21.69]That's not fair.
[71:22.33]I got on it first.
[71:24.81]I think I'm starting to understand.
[71:26.21]So there's an object limit and me placing the poop sign meant that we couldn't place other objects.
[71:32.73]I think that's what happened.
[71:33.79]Alright, use your sense.
[71:34.97]Make sure there's nothing here.
[71:36.99]Where the hell are we?
[71:42.02]There's a document in here.
[71:45.82]We went... Where do we go?
[71:47.04]There's a lot of stuff here.
[71:50.92]Oh, this way.
[71:51.46]Oh, look.
[71:52.89]There it is.
[71:53.47]There are all of our stupid things that we placed.
[71:56.71]You can see them?
[71:57.53]I can see them on the mini-map.
[71:58.85]Like, on the actual map-map.
[72:01.47]Yeah.
[72:02.17]Well, it's alright.
[72:04.04]Like, on the map?
[72:05.12]Like, if you press select?
[72:06.96]Yeah, you can see where we placed them.
[72:09.62]Yeah, I see them.
[72:11.58]That's funny, though, that they're permanent.
[72:12.81]Alright.
[72:13.07]So now where is this monster?
[72:17.41]Find out what creature made the roar.
[72:21.59]I think if you hold your senses, we were being guided in this direction.
[72:35.33]Dude, I landed on the ground with such force.
[72:38.95]It was so bad.
[72:40.07]Jarmo, you're going to like the view up here.
[72:41.35]Okay, good.
[72:45.39]Oh my god.
[72:46.15]Oh, we got a Pat raid.
[72:47.15]What's up, Pat?
[72:48.69]Thank you.
[72:49.13]That was so violent.
[72:55.72]I want to be there too.
[72:56.46]It's not fair.
[72:59.22]You will be.
[73:01.04]You will be.
[73:06.01]Warthog.
[73:11.67]We will crush it.
[73:13.65]I mean, crush it we will.
[73:15.77]How come, why are people so afraid to have somebody with a funny voice as the main character?
[73:20.75]Like, like Yoder?
[73:24.23]Yeah, I mean, just like how come the main character in video games can't, you know, talk like this?
[73:28.13]Why not?
[73:29.41]That's why we need more Muppet games.
[73:32.00]Seriously, like, Muppet Treasure Island was a great game, and everyone had that voice.
[73:39.59]Someone in my chat wrote, because cringe culture.
[73:43.87]No, no.
[73:45.85]Funny voice is great.
[73:47.13]I made a career out of it.
[73:48.78]Actually, you know what, people?
[73:50.08]That would get annoying.
[73:52.71]Yeah, after a while.
[73:53.59]I mean, but Mario has a funny voice, someone just said.
[73:56.56]And, like, he goes, woo!
[73:57.76]The whole game.
[73:58.30]And we just get used to it.
[74:00.14]But Mario is not... Mario, you know, going like, Yahoo!
[74:04.56]He's not going like, Yahoo!
[74:06.38]And by the way, let's talk about current political landscape.
[74:09.74]Like, he doesn't really... He doesn't really talk about it.
[74:12.90]Luigi does that.
[74:14.96]Luigi's like, oh, Mario, we're going to eat that meat.
[74:18.36]You know, I actually really... I like that voice.
[74:23.54]I don't think I would have a problem with that voice.
[74:25.96]I wouldn't either.
[74:26.66]You know, we're going to make the pasta, the pizza.
[74:28.89]I like that voice.
[74:29.77]Charles Martinet actually talked to people.
[74:33.69]Like...
[74:42.13]As Mario.
[74:43.15]Like, he can hold, like, full conversations with people as Mario.
[74:47.31]What an absolute saint of a person, by the way.
[74:49.24]Yeah, he's a champ.
[74:50.60]He's awesome.
[74:52.16]I met him once, and he was, like, it was a long convention.
[74:54.66]Really?
[74:54.90]And he was signing for days and days and days.
[74:57.24]Like, oh, three days.
[74:58.90]And I met him at the very end of a day.
[75:01.30]We were both tired, but he was way tired.
[75:02.92]You could hear his voice was just tired, and he was still doing the voices for me while he was signing my photo.
[75:08.13]He was like, Wahoo!
[75:09.39]It's me, Mario!
[75:09.95]Really?
[75:10.95]And he just signed and drew pictures all over it and he was so nice to me.
[75:15.09]And I was like, Charles, thank you.
[75:16.27]You just, you just made my day.
[75:17.83]You just made my month.
[75:19.65]Really sweet guy.
[75:20.43]Alright.
[75:22.09]We can use the tower search.
[75:25.43]Oh, that's what this does.
[75:26.73]Alright.
[75:27.09]So if it's in the area, if you put down one of these towers, that's how it's being illuminated through the walls.
[75:34.53]And if we use flying, it says flying vine, we can do surprise attacks.
[75:38.53]Yep.
[75:40.57]No, he just seems like a really, really swell guy.
[75:43.78]Yeah, he's good.
[75:45.06]Good lad.
[75:46.08]So, how do you want to handle this?
[75:47.38]Do you want to do a zipline?
[75:49.88]Do we have enough points to do it?
[75:52.20]I'm going to see if we can make one, but I see a little... Jerma?
[75:58.35]Yeah?
[76:01.21]Jerma, can you get over here?
[76:02.75]Yep.
[76:05.17]Alright, never mind.
[76:05.75]You know what?
[76:07.31]Probably wouldn't be good for your sponsorship, but
[76:11.15]But here, can you follow me?
[76:19.71]That was pretty fucking cool, not gonna lie.
[76:24.06]Okay.
[76:25.40]Alright, I'm just... Hey, name me another game where you can do something like that.
[76:31.30]Good point, I can't right this second.
[76:32.68]Good point.
[76:36.10]Someone said Sonic 06.
[76:37.68]That was pretty pog to me.
[76:38.98]Skyrim.
[76:41.60]Alright.
[76:44.20]Alright, yeah.
[76:45.08]We can zipline that dude.
[76:47.14]Let's go for it.
[76:47.70]Alright, hang on.
[76:51.56]Let me see if I can do a zipline.
[76:53.22]Can I just jump?
[76:55.06]I don't have enough resources.
[76:58.08]Unfortunately, we might need to go and dismantle these useless... I made two or three of them in the same place.
[77:04.43]Let's see.
[77:09.51]dragon pit isn't powerful enough oh hang on hang on before we give up let me look for um there's there's a thing there's an item you can get and then you can increase the the amount of stuff you can place yeah those little pits with the purple uh with the dragon pits I think we need more of them there's one down here is that the one we already got so there's one over here but I can't upgrade it because I don't have the material for it
[77:39.76]Yeah, the collision.
[77:40.42]I don't know what's going on.
[77:42.50]I'm looking.
[77:43.56]Somebody said, is this actually an open world game?
[77:45.20]Can you just climb that stuff in the distance?
[77:46.99]I think that's accurate.
[77:49.91]I'm pretty sure it's just like a big open map.
[77:52.53]I think that's accurate.
[77:56.13]I think we can just kind of go up pretty much anywhere we want.
[77:59.50]Or maybe it's different areas that load up.
[78:02.54]You can even go into the sky.
[78:05.47]Oh, I found, oh wait, no, I found a core stone.
[78:07.79]Um, I mean, I guess we could just go down there and kill the thing.
[78:11.68]Is there, I wonder if we can like dismantle things on the map or something.
[78:15.98]We could just go down there.
[78:16.76]Jack, can you dismantle things from the map?
[78:19.98]Let's just, I'm gonna, let's head down there.
[78:21.16]Alright.
[78:24.97]Just don't fall too far.
[78:29.19]Oh, I'm alive.
[78:32.17]I'm good.
[78:32.71]That hurt a lot, but I'm good.
[78:35.56]Huh.
[78:35.92]I didn't take any damage from that.
[78:39.11]There's probably a... Alright, he's like right here.
[78:41.01]Alright, everything we learned, everything we trained.
[78:45.61]It's time to kill this thing.
[78:47.53]Okay.
[78:47.81]Wait, dismantle this shit.
[78:50.91]Oh, so here's how you do it.
[78:53.53]Yeah, I think this is yours.
[78:54.89]Right stick.
[78:56.25]So go into the thing and then right stick.
[78:58.83]Click in.
[79:00.60]And then you can dismantle.
[79:02.70]I think it has to... Oh, here's another one of these.
[79:07.43]activate this thing we need extra materials were you able to activate it no no the host has to okay that's so weird that only I can do it I guess it is my game world right following your game world but yeah I think that's probably why can we sneak over yeah I don't have the materials
[79:29.75]Someone said, I have both yours and Jerma's dreams open at once.
[79:33.63]That's a good lad.
[79:34.51]That's pretty cool.
[79:36.65]Yeah, that's a good chat member.
[79:39.29]Let's put some shit around the area.
[79:40.43]You know what I mean?
[79:40.93]I'm going to put a spring over here.
[79:44.14]Maybe have springs all around so we can kind of keep the monster in the same... You know, put springs around, boxes around.
[79:49.38]I got springs.
[79:50.90]Okay, got a bunch of springs.
[79:51.92]Okay.
[79:57.32]Alright, are we ready to... I'm going to aggro.
[80:08.01]Alright, here it is.
[80:08.83]Whoa, it's roar just knocked me back.
[80:10.23]This is a two star monster.
[80:11.63]Are we in trouble here?
[80:14.23]We could seek assistance.
[80:16.13]I guess that's like help from randos.
[80:18.65]Shit, he almost killed me in one hit.
[80:20.01]We're gonna go hog wild.
[80:21.18]Alright, I gotta get this parry down.
[80:24.88]Oh my god.
[80:37.80]And here we... Shit.
[80:43.05]Yeah, this is a problem.
[80:43.97]This thing is huge.
[80:46.57]It's very big.
[80:52.23]Oh my god.
[80:53.43]This hog is counting all of my tactics.
[80:55.51]Look at the eyes.
[80:56.69]Look at so many eyes.
[80:58.93]Oh yeah.
[80:59.41]Oh god, it's got a lot of eyes.
[81:00.57]Oh, I don't like that.
[81:01.29]That's so weird.
[81:09.16]Back legs.
[81:10.72]Back legs seem to be vulnerable.
[81:13.12]That one did.
[81:14.86]Get this tree out of the way.
[81:21.40]Chat, don't worry.
[81:22.78]We're going to put the squeeze on this hog.
[81:28.71]What?
[81:29.03]Unleash.
[81:29.97]Unleash.
[81:30.33]How did I not get the parrot?
[81:31.69]A little bit.
[81:32.43]Got a little bit.
[81:44.77]Oh, there it is.
[81:45.29]I got one.
[81:50.95]Careful.
[81:53.75]This weapon is definitely for a master.
[81:56.05]It's not me.
[81:57.81]Yeah.
[81:59.97]I mean, I'm even struggling with this big sword.
[82:03.34]So...
[82:12.28]Am I missing stamina?
[82:12.84]There you go.
[82:14.18]I did some damage there.
[82:15.72]If you knew the monster patterns, yeah.
[82:18.00]I think this thing is higher level than us, but we'll pay.
[82:20.84]Vinny, how do you enjoy Monster Hunter?
[82:23.75]I've played a lot of Monster Hunter.
[82:26.07]Try, 3U, 4, World, Rise.
[82:31.71]Sorry to just list my credentials, but no, it's true.
[82:34.19]My credentials.
[82:38.00]I played a lot, but I don't get like I play like 100 hours of each game and then I just after that I'm good.
[82:44.15]And that's like no small amount for me.
[82:50.23]Gamer resume exactly.
[82:51.47]I got it.
[82:53.15]I'm going to try to get Perry.
[82:54.79]It's like a whack.
[82:55.95]Nope.
[82:56.73]Alright, that's a long swing.
[82:58.97]That's a very long swing.
[83:02.01]Shit.
[83:03.51]I might have to go mall.
[83:17.42]I might have to start harvesting some materials.
[83:20.46]Don't forget you can attack and charge.
[83:22.10]Oh, no, I know, but then the hog attacks me and then I end up... I end up, like, losing the combo.
[83:29.94]Okay, he's running.
[83:33.80]LB?
[83:34.62]What's going on right now?
[83:36.94]What the... Wait, what?
[83:38.42]What did I just do?
[83:41.49]What did you... Whoa.
[83:42.41]What the fuck did I just do?
[83:44.23]What did you do?
[83:44.93]Holy shit.
[83:46.15]I don't know.
[83:48.84]I went, like, instinct mode, and I made a bulwark?
[83:53.26]A bulwark fusion caracura just flashed into existence.
[83:58.79]I think that's the play for this one.
[84:01.21]Bulwarks can fend off charging kimono.
[84:03.21]Use a fusion of... Ow.
[84:05.35]Two rows of free crates.
[84:09.04]Alright.
[84:09.60]Uh-oh, you're down.
[84:11.26]Yeah.
[84:13.66]Parried?
[84:15.94]You can... Um...
[84:18.32]Oh, my God.
[84:19.64]No way, dude.
[84:24.86]I tried.
[84:26.04]I tried.
[84:26.36]I think we're dead.
[84:27.81]No, no, no.
[84:28.23]You got this.
[84:28.65]You got this.
[84:29.47]No, I'm dead.
[84:30.43]Alright.
[84:31.77]I think this thing is a little more difficult.
[84:36.53]So we have three tries, it seems.
[84:37.97]So retreat?
[84:39.79]Yeah, we have to retreat, and then I think run back.
[84:44.42]Oh, Dremel, grab some of this water.
[84:49.01]Revival point.
[84:49.79]Oh, it's back in camp.
[84:54.09]Yes, definitely do get... Hold on, do we have... Did your meat dry?
[85:01.24]It dried.
[85:01.72]I got it.
[85:02.24]I don't know what else to do with it.
[85:09.26]Oh, I don't think I dried it properly last time.
[85:11.04]I'm going to try to... Let me try the other weapon.
[85:17.07]How do you eat the meat, chat?
[85:18.27]Do you know?
[85:23.01]Or was it like auto-eat-meat?
[85:25.83]Auto.
[85:25.99]I think they're gonna go this way.
[85:35.37]You should upgrade your gear.
[85:36.81]I don't know if I can right now.
[85:38.37]Like, we don't have enough materials to really upgrade gear.
[85:44.07]Left on D-pad to eat meat.
[85:46.99]Oh, it is that.
[85:47.57]Okay.
[85:49.80]Alright, let me just real quick.
[85:52.04]I just want to mess around with the mall.
[86:01.99]This thing is... Okay, while you do that, I'm going to... Oh my God, it's huge.
[86:06.17]It's got like a small handle too.
[86:07.87]I feel like this would be hard to handle.
[86:09.11]Alright, let me try it.
[86:13.97]Have you heard about stream squad?
[86:15.11]It makes it easier for people to watch your stream when you're playing with friends.
[86:19.28]No, I didn't know about that really.
[86:22.82]Jumping smash.
[86:23.90]Nice.
[86:28.83]You're trying to fight one of, if not the last boss of the map.
[86:32.23]You skipped all the one star fights.
[86:35.27]Says a chat member.
[86:35.99]I don't know how true that is, but it feels true.
[86:38.87]That felt hard.
[86:47.15]Alright, this is way cooler.
[86:48.95]Extended Maul held.
[87:01.90]You went straight to Ganon.
[87:03.22]Yeah, pretty much.
[87:07.39]There's also another Rage Tail.
[87:09.83]Um...
[87:12.53]Oh, you can see... Okay, because the towers we built have, like, radius of, like, where the monsters are.
[87:19.58]So, yeah, we... So, wait, this is a little explosion.
[87:25.42]Is that what it does?
[87:28.58]I'm sure this boss, you switch to Minato map, the NPCs are looking for its entire village.
[87:38.59]Cool.
[87:41.46]Yeah, it's a telescoping handle.
[87:48.31]XRT, XRT, XRT, XRT.
[87:53.33]How does this combo work?
[87:58.32]Here, you know what?
[87:59.24]You do that and I'm going to deconstruct all this crap that I built.
[88:03.80]There we go.
[88:05.02]Jesus.
[88:10.59]I suggest doing this boss since you pick up side quests at the village after this boss.
[88:15.07]I mean, if we can, we're gonna try.
[88:17.95]Gotta get this down.
[88:27.82]So it's like you smash, then you press right trigger, then you press it again, right trigger, and then you press it again.
[88:35.05]Okay.
[88:39.65]Instant extend power smash.
[88:41.69]Alright, that one's way cooler.
[88:48.53]Yeah, I'm just going to go resource gathering while Jerma is learning the hammer.
[88:56.38]I feel like I'm going to like it.
[88:59.20]Alright, I think I'm ready.
[89:08.16]So what else do we have?
[89:10.20]We've got King Tusk.
[89:12.46]We've got... King Tusk and that rat again.
[89:14.18]Which could be good to upgrade our stuff, but... I mean, it's up to you.
[89:20.18]Do you want to go for the rat and then come back to the King Tusk, or... Yeah.
[89:25.51]Let's do some resource gathering.
[89:27.83]Let's actually... I'm gonna go destroy all this shit that I made over here.
[89:34.81]Okay.
[89:35.29]I'll be back in two seconds.
[89:37.11]Yeah, take your time.
[89:38.03]I found the rat, so I'll just be there.
[89:45.12]I'm going to go delete that stuff.
[89:46.76]Because it's just, it's sucking up resources.
[89:51.04]What's the fastest way to get there?
[90:00.75]I think fast travel only works to camp, but yeah, we'd have to make a bunch of zip lines.
[90:06.01]It's definitely worth me going and getting rid of them.
[90:09.93]But I think that's only per area.
[90:12.73]I'm almost positive it's a per area thing.
[90:16.85]And then you can just go to a new area and build more, but you need to upgrade the limit.
[90:23.82]Chat members, can you confirm this?
[90:25.78]I think that's accurate.
[90:26.50]Uh-oh.
[90:32.71]Seems like it's accurate.
[90:35.65]Something just screamed at me.
[90:36.53]I don't know what it was.
[90:37.08]Oh, I found a new ball.
[90:41.40]New ball just dropped.
[90:52.83]You need your pits upgraded.
[90:54.33]That sounds weird when you type it like that, but I know what you're talking about.
[90:58.28]Oh my god, I fell.
[91:00.99]This is probably a better way to do this, but... Just gotta be more mindful of it.
[91:07.81]Dude, can you seriously climb this?
[91:09.83]Oh, what am I doing?
[91:10.35]I have... Boxes can help.
[91:12.67]Yeah, that's right.
[91:15.24]We just had the same issue, and I had to build boxes the same time you did.
[91:19.16]Found a friend.
[91:19.52]It's like in a different area of the map.
[91:20.54]Okay.
[91:25.04]Okay.
[91:29.79]Alright, bounce.
[91:32.45]Bounce, please.
[91:33.73]Bounce, please.
[91:35.53]Well, there's a rock and whatever.
[91:41.21]I think we talked about this, but you're not going to Boston for PAX, right?
[91:45.02]I am not.
[91:46.42]Okay, well, I think we did talk about that.
[91:47.92]Sorry.
[91:50.30]Yeah, I haven't really been to very many conventions or meetups or anything like that in a while.
[91:56.24]Yeah.
[91:58.17]I'm going to kill this frog.
[91:58.79]What about TwitchCon in Vegas?
[92:05.75]I mean, that's here.
[92:08.89]Yeah, that's close to you.
[92:10.31]I considered that one.
[92:11.29]I haven't been to the West Coast or the Middle Coast very much at all, ever.
[92:17.48]The problem I have with that is last year it was the same time as Comic-Con.
[92:22.26]And I like going to New York Comic-Con, so I just went there instead.
[92:26.62]I'm going the right way.
[92:29.58]I think I am.
[92:32.68]Yeah, I'm picking up a bunch of resources too.
[92:34.34]Just anything I can find.
[92:36.30]Yeah, me too.
[92:38.20]Like I already found another upgrade area.
[92:41.06]Vinny, there's no coast in the middle.
[92:43.53]Yeah, it's just a bunch of fields.
[92:45.65]But like if you go south, there's like the Gulf of Mexico.
[92:48.25]No?
[92:48.93]Ooh, I got a snail.
[92:52.41]Oh, that's the Gulf Coast.
[92:54.91]Alright, I'm almost there.
[92:56.77]Don't fall, please.
[92:59.94]Why did I not make the thing?
[93:00.84]Oh, I'm good.
[93:05.37]How do I get up here?
[93:12.79]Vinny, wrong direction?
[93:14.35]Well, how do you know where I'm going?
[93:18.18]I don't know where I'm going, actually.
[93:20.96]I'm looking for a rat.
[93:21.94]Have you seen a rat anywhere?
[93:24.98]Hold on.
[93:25.34]Where is the rat?
[93:26.16]Oh, I found the rat.
[93:28.26]The pink icon.
[93:30.21]Oh, shit.
[93:30.75]Alright, I'm coming in a minute.
[93:33.11]I'm going to teleport back to the cam and I'll meet you there.
[93:41.65]Crystals.
[93:42.11]Alright, where... Where are they?
[93:51.58]They're like behind me.
[93:54.82]I hope I'm going the right way.
[93:57.78]Yep, this is definitely the right way.
[94:05.74]I have initiated rat fight.
[94:07.58]I am about to initiate the one we just did.
[94:10.82]Hold on.
[94:11.74]Let me just delete this stuff.
[94:12.66]Don't fight me.
[94:14.74]Please, don't hurt me.
[94:20.51]I just want to get... Uh-oh.
[94:23.09]Alright, here's one.
[94:29.57]Here they are.
[94:30.37]Good, good, good, good.
[94:33.40]Oh, fuck.
[94:37.09]Get off me.
[94:37.45]Alright, I think this one's not mine.
[94:41.09]Isn't it though?
[94:43.33]Can you not deconstruct it?
[94:44.57]Oh yeah, there we go.
[94:45.19]Alright, did that free anything up?
[94:50.78]Can you look in your menu?
[94:52.78]It might, but again, I think since it's per area, I think it should be okay.
[94:56.70]Wherever I am, I think it's different.
[94:59.72]Alright, I'm coming.
[95:00.52]I'm not sure, but it might also be a limit on the zip lines.
[95:04.70]I don't know how this game works.
[95:06.01]I don't know.
[95:06.95]It definitely is per area because I just deleted them and they're still there.
[95:09.68]It's definitely per area.
[95:11.10]Alright, I'm coming to you.
[95:15.44]Yeah, I'm whaling on the rat.
[95:17.64]It's going great.
[95:18.20]Alright, I've got to figure out how you got there.
[95:29.01]How did you get over there?
[95:30.81]Oh, I've got to go this way.
[95:35.42]Can you take a bite out of a bar of soap on stream?
[95:38.34]No.
[95:39.60]What?
[95:40.60]It's kind of unhinged, chat member.
[95:42.82]Why are people like, oh, yeah, yeah, that'd be so awesome if you did that.
[95:46.03]Oh, man, I hope you eat soap.
[95:47.31]Why would I eat soap for no reason?
[95:51.45]No, it's a good bit, streamer.
[95:53.05]Trust me.
[95:53.85]I've eaten soap at least three times before I got here today.
[95:56.63]Alright, I need to go back to the road.
[95:59.57]You're going to kill that thing before I even get there.
[96:03.66]Chat, I won't even facecam.
[96:04.96]What makes you think I'm going to eat soap?
[96:10.82]And then it's to the left, right?
[96:13.88]Okay, here we go.
[96:14.88]Coming.
[96:22.83]I was so close to unleashing my fury upon this rat.
[96:25.31]Am I going the right way?
[96:34.91]As long as I get the finishing blow, that's all I care about.
[96:37.87]You know what I noticed?
[96:39.25]You don't have to sharpen your weapons.
[96:41.35]No.
[96:43.73]That is a great thing to not have to do.
[96:47.69]I get why that's in the other series, but it's kind of nice to just fight and not think about it.
[96:54.14]Okay, I'm still trying to find you.
[96:57.74]I think I can go this way.
[97:04.92]I can't eat anything at the moment.
[97:06.93]Fuck.
[97:09.83]No.
[97:13.45]I see your name.
[97:14.27]I see the chef.
[97:16.43]Okay.
[97:23.28]I'm coming.
[97:23.58]I'm coming.
[97:23.84]I'm coming.
[97:24.10]I'm coming.
[97:24.36]I'm coming.
[97:24.90]Okay.
[97:25.68]Good.
[97:25.98]Good.
[97:26.14]Good.
[97:26.32]I'm almost there.
[97:28.84]I'm 200 miles away.
[97:30.36]Almost there.
[97:40.80]Oh, no.
[97:41.28]Oh, no, no, no, no.
[97:41.84]Rat, don't.
[97:42.86]Don't do it.
[97:43.38]I'm getting there.
[97:43.88]Can you see me?
[97:47.82]I think I can see.
[97:48.92]Was that you?
[97:49.88]I see you.
[97:50.30]I see you.
[98:01.29]Alright.
[98:03.01]What's up?
[98:04.45]Yeah, help me fight this rat.
[98:10.54]And then, like, we can use rat materials to further upgrade our weapons.
[98:13.44]It's gonna be fucking awesome.
[98:15.64]Oh, there's a ball here.
[98:16.44]He's running away.
[98:17.22]Jerm, Jerm, ball.
[98:18.50]Ball?
[98:19.62]Ball to befriend.
[98:20.30]Oh, I got one.
[98:30.27]Alright, rat.
[98:33.45]I like this town.
[98:36.25]Pretty cool.
[98:36.85]Looks good.
[98:38.69]Uh, how do we get over there?
[98:49.54]Okay, now that was way more damage than I've ever done.
[98:51.84]Nice.
[98:53.90]Gonna unleash the fucking fury upon the rat.
[99:03.09]Oh my god, 500 damage.
[99:12.29]I think it's kind of like trapped in here too.
[99:14.71]Might be.
[99:26.13]Right in the head.
[99:33.59]Did it run out?
[99:35.24]Ah, I lost it.
[99:35.92]I lost the charge.
[99:37.06]I think there's a material here.
[99:38.20]Yep.
[99:43.20]Got it.
[99:44.92]Cool.
[99:49.23]I'm enjoying this, actually.
[99:50.17]I think it's pretty good.
[99:52.51]Yeah, I think just learning how the mechanics work are important.
[99:57.08]Yeah, they're going for the box stuff.
[100:01.16]I get what they're doing.
[100:03.00]The same way in Rise you can use your bug to go to the sky and then do an attack, in this you just build boxes.
[100:10.59]Once you figure out the combos and that and dodging, it makes sense.
[100:14.65]Alright, this thing is inside of this room now.
[100:19.97]You know what?
[100:20.77]Yeah, fuck it.
[100:21.35]Speaking of that...
[100:25.02]Oh, that would have been so awesome.
[100:26.18]You all know it.
[100:26.88]Oh, I actually landed it.
[100:31.92]Why is there a little possum down here?
[100:33.76]See that?
[100:34.55]It's like a little possum friend.
[100:36.01]I think this might be the same species.
[100:38.35]I don't know.
[100:42.13]It's like a little fella.
[100:44.11]Oh.
[100:47.68]Again.
[100:48.86]Again.
[100:49.14]Stop running.
[100:51.94]It's dead.
[100:52.90]Fucking dead now.
[101:02.24]It's all about using the springs and stuff.
[101:06.32]Yeah, I gotta start building more springs.
[101:10.27]Let's see.
[101:21.27]Oh, nice.
[101:24.13]Do it, please!
[101:26.81]Again!
[101:30.95]Oh man, I had so many opportunities, I just screwed up.
[101:35.39]Yeah, I'm not doing the combos very well.
[101:42.94]It's like this swing, right trigger, swing, right trigger, swing, right trigger, swing.
[101:47.50]This little fella part of your vocabulary now.
[101:49.56]That's been a part of my vocabulary for like the past decade.
[101:52.26]That's like a Carl Pilkington thing that I've just like said for years.
[102:01.81]It's a monkey news up here monkey news little fella Very dead I think very dead very dead Carve it
[102:25.75]Yeah, I always have a problem in monster hunting games like this.
[102:29.33]Because I don't know what to play with.
[102:32.43]I always go, no, no, something else.
[102:34.29]And then I change and I have to relearn the whole thing.
[102:35.83]And then I go, no, something else.
[102:36.71]And I have to relearn the whole thing.
[102:38.05]No, something else.
[102:40.09]You end up sticking with something though.
[102:42.23]Yeah, like I said, I have like my two.
[102:44.45]But even then I forget like which one I'm using.
[102:47.41]And then I'm like, oh, I'm pressing the wrong buttons.
[102:50.03]I'm sorry.
[102:51.39]I couldn't escape.
[102:52.39]I couldn't go anywhere.
[102:53.59]That was a good sneeze.
[102:54.67]That was like a powerful sneeze.
[102:55.99]I like got out of the chair.
[103:00.70]Alright, maybe we should make some armor.
[103:04.06]Yes, I like that idea.
[103:05.54]I'm gonna teleport back to camp, I think.
[103:11.22]Vinny, your duck sneeze.
[103:12.46]Yeah, I do a duck sneeze.
[103:13.90]People like that.
[103:14.84]I just sound like a duck when I sneeze.
[103:16.56]I'm like...
[103:19.41]And people are like, do you do that in public?
[103:20.84]And my answer is I fucking try not to.
[103:28.10]Wait, we discovered it.
[103:28.90]We discovered one.
[103:30.26]Target kimono discovered.
[103:34.62]Oh, I see.
[103:35.10]Okay.
[103:37.08]So I wonder, do you see these grayed out things?
[103:41.50]Yeah, those are... Are those the camps or the dragon thing?
[103:45.74]Yeah, I think those are the ones that I've upgraded.
[103:48.25]The pits.
[103:49.93]So we got to like, yeah, if we go to those and upgrade them, we can place more garbage.
[103:57.26]Yeah.
[103:57.60]Oh, I can actually do it from here.
[104:00.14]Really?
[104:01.18]Yeah.
[104:01.40]Yeah.
[104:01.54]I just upgraded one.
[104:03.84]You have to like actually see it first and then you can upgrade it.
[104:06.80]Paddle scoop.
[104:12.92]Oh, this is an automatic fish catcher.
[104:22.64]Let me see if I can upgrade something.
[104:29.60]Just upgraded.
[104:31.42]I got a new thing.
[104:32.06]Oh, okay.
[104:34.44]I can do this.
[104:35.42]It's an ornamental lantern.
[104:36.70]I think I'm going this way.
[104:47.03]Oh, Jerma, collect this food when you get a chance.
[104:50.75]the dried out food.
[104:51.81]And if you press left on the D-pad, you can use it before we fight and it'll give you a boost.
[104:56.79]There's also inherited skills here.
[104:58.75]I'm like putting that on.
[105:01.35]Interesting.
[105:03.09]What do you mean?
[105:03.81]Where's that?
[105:04.57]When you go into your weapon upgrades, you can kind of take inherited skills from the thing you just had.
[105:10.22]Okay.
[105:10.76]That's interesting.
[105:12.28]This thing's way cooler.
[105:13.06]Look at my magma hammer.
[105:15.00]Nice.
[105:27.39]I need one more Rage Tail thing and then I can get the better sword.
[105:30.84]Damn it.
[105:32.64]Alright, I think I got this combo down.
[105:35.22]Bang, whack.
[105:37.12]Bang, whack.
[105:38.77]And then wham.
[105:41.49]Which one's bang and which one's whack?
[105:44.39]Bang is X, whack is right trigger.
[105:47.45]Okay.
[105:54.01]Health boost.
[105:55.07]Oh, this armor has a health boost.
[105:56.39]Are you going to play anything else today or just this?
[105:59.04]I think in a little bit I'll play something else.
[106:02.10]Maybe.
[106:02.42]We'll see.
[106:08.49]Dark and Darker ended, right?
[106:10.65]Yes, it did.
[106:13.79]needed I needed that to end because my productivity was dipping anyway I need like I'll wait like another month and a half and I'll be happy with that that's fine we could go kill that zap scourge again if you want to which one's that that's the fire one that was burning like the whole forest down oh yeah oh the sap scourge gotcha yeah yeah um
[106:37.16]We could do that.
[106:38.08]We could just, yeah, we could just go like explore and find things to hunt.
[106:41.98]I'm fine with that too.
[106:43.64]You know what?
[106:44.96]We could go like here, like that blue icon or the purple one and we can build a tower and just see what's out there.
[106:54.31]I'm into it.
[106:54.69]Let's go.
[106:59.43]Why did I do that?
[107:06.25]Wild hearts.
[107:07.42]I feel like I'm going to be way happier with this weapon.
[107:18.37]Oh, where's our thing that we placed?
[107:21.05]We got like a... I destroyed a couple of things.
[107:28.47]Do you want to just kind of explore?
[107:29.45]Yeah, maybe we'll explore and we'll find... We'll go this way and maybe and then we'll just like...
[107:37.95]Um... We'll probably run into something.
[107:40.19]Yeah, we'll run into something.
[107:41.13]I'll build a tower.
[107:44.11]Have you told Jerma about your pet owl yet?
[107:46.76]What is this pet owl stuff that people keep- What are you talking about?
[107:49.90]You got a pet owl?
[107:52.26]No!
[107:56.59]Flacco from the New York Zoo.
[107:58.23]Oh, right.
[107:58.65]Yeah, because there was an owl that escaped from the Central Park Zoo.
[108:01.41]And he's just chilling in Central Park and like eating rats.
[108:04.41]What?
[108:04.97]Um... Yeah.
[108:11.92]I can't wait to just magma smash.
[108:16.88]Not fair.
[108:17.16]I'm heavier than you.
[108:19.28]I'm heavier than you.
[108:20.90]Not fair.
[108:23.48]Oh, we went... Oh, we can go up and around, I guess.
[108:27.73]Vinny, tell him about the female owl plan.
[108:29.67]Alright, well, Jeremy, I don't know if you're interested in this information, but in order to catch the owl... No.
[108:38.30]No?
[108:38.90]Alright.
[108:44.12]No, I'm just fucking around.
[108:45.24]What is it?
[108:46.22]Oh, ball here, ball.
[108:47.42]Ball.
[108:49.10]In order to catch the owl...
[108:51.93]They're putting a female owl of the same species in a little cage, and they're just going to dangle it in front of the owl and hope it goes into the cage.
[109:01.05]What?
[109:01.25]I'm not even kidding.
[109:03.25]That's how they're going to catch the owl.
[109:05.41]That's the plan?
[109:06.41]Yeah, that's the plan.
[109:11.37]What kind of plan is that?
[109:13.46]That's a good one.
[109:15.06]Hopefully it works.
[109:15.86]I hope they catch that owl.
[109:19.14]I read that and I was like, wait, no, that can't be real.
[109:21.78]It's like Bugs Bunny shit.
[109:22.86]I was going to say that that's some like Looney Tunes level of, I guess it's just put this here and hope it works.
[109:31.22]Hope it goes for it.
[109:32.14]That's it.
[109:32.56]I like this slide.
[109:35.62]Alright.
[109:35.94]So we are down here.
[109:44.21]Maybe put a beacon up over here somewhere?
[109:47.45]Let us... What's that?
[109:53.01]What's that creature over there?
[109:54.57]I think that's the big scary one.
[109:55.85]Oh, that's the King Tusk again.
[109:57.59]Okay, let's go this way and we'll place one.
[109:59.57]I'm just picking up every single thing I see.
[110:06.48]Oh, this is the one I made earlier.
[110:07.88]The useless one.
[110:09.16]Oh, I destroyed it.
[110:12.32]Tom literally did that to Jerry.
[110:19.37]Oh, the plan?
[110:20.35]Yeah.
[110:20.59]Oh, we can upgrade this.
[110:30.50]Okay.
[110:32.26]You can now conjure more dragon something something here.
[110:35.01]Okay.
[110:35.93]Oh, yeah.
[110:36.43]Yeah, we can.
[110:37.17]Wow, that's way more.
[110:38.47]We had like two before.
[110:39.87]It's 59 now.
[110:40.99]Holy shit.
[110:42.81]That's so much better.
[110:43.43]That's good.
[110:47.94]We can go...
[110:50.06]Let's see.
[110:52.09]Yeah, let's go over this way.
[110:53.99]I'm going to build a tower.
[110:56.37]We'll see if there's any monsters chilling.
[111:00.45]Has it got a squirrel?
[111:03.15]It's always Monster Hunter, but what about monster chilling?
[111:05.96]Like, why can't I just hang out?
[111:09.04]I think that's what we're doing right now.
[111:13.30]Alright, let's see if we can find something.
[111:17.00]I can't build it because your dragon pit isn't powerful enough.
[111:23.74]Let me just head back this way and see.
[111:28.20]I think we're out of the zone.
[111:30.48]If you look at the map, see the map?
[111:34.21]Maybe we have to be in those zones.
[111:35.75]I think that makes sense.
[111:37.83]Yeah, let me get closer to this.
[111:43.67]If you sneak up on wild animals, you can pet them and get free resources.
[111:47.84]Oh, you actually can pet the animals?
[111:49.36]You can?
[111:50.98]What?
[111:53.42]You just, like, changed Jerma's life.
[111:55.14]Thanks, chat member.
[112:01.36]I want to do that.
[112:01.84]Uh, no, I can't place this here.
[112:05.37]It still says the dragon pit isn't powerful enough.
[112:07.45]That's weird.
[112:12.04]We can just go kill that pig.
[112:17.04]I just want to keep exploring up here.
[112:18.94]Let's go up here and then we'll loop around and if we don't see anything, we'll kill pig.
[112:31.96]I think the issue is that because you're the host, it's technically your game.
[112:37.66]So I can't interact with those.
[112:42.61]It's just so weird.
[112:44.11]I get it, but it's also really weird and not really in there.
[112:47.37]Anything in here?
[112:49.37]Nothing that I saw.
[112:50.35]Oh, there's cool rocks to break.
[112:52.41]Yeah, there's rocks to break, yeah.
[112:59.26]Basecamp, please.
[112:59.90]You are so close to getting it.
[113:02.94]You are.
[113:03.42]Just keep up the good behavior, JermaChat.
[113:06.38]Keep up the good behavior.
[113:10.90]I think we got a lot more damage too.
[113:14.60]I now am not doing like four damage total the whole encounter.
[113:18.53]Cool.
[113:20.73]So I'm down.
[113:21.49]I mean, we can loop back around this way and try to get to the hog again.
[113:25.83]Down for that.
[113:29.01]Where did you go?
[113:29.49]You're over there.
[113:34.34]What percentage still facecam?
[113:35.54]You're at like 92%.
[113:40.72]Your other towers are overlapping.
[113:42.38]Well, that would make sense.
[113:46.96]This is a cool looking area.
[113:52.09]Yeah, this is cool.
[113:52.59]Yeah, I think the chat member is right, though.
[113:54.83]Like, I built too many towers too close.
[113:57.67]Oh, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep.
[114:02.75]Can you pet the snail?
[114:05.52]Wait, I need to see if this is real.
[114:12.32]It's real.
[114:13.18]Holy shit, I just pet this weird tree creature of whom it's family we've probably killed a couple times.
[114:18.13]How do you do it?
[114:20.11]So you press the dodge button while standing still to crouch and go stealth.
[114:27.83]And then you get close to the creature and then you just pet them.
[114:31.85]It'll show you the button.
[114:33.43]I think I accidentally angered this thing.
[114:38.86]I hit it right in the fucking head.
[114:49.52]Yeah, it's too late to pet it.
[114:50.50]It's angry.
[114:55.38]I mean, I guess it's angry.
[114:56.48]It looks angry.
[114:57.04]Well, it's angry at me, not you.
[115:01.93]Alright.
[115:02.35]Alright.
[115:03.51]Alright.
[115:06.01]Oh, I feel so bad.
[115:07.01]I have to leave.
[115:09.89]It's just this weird little hop.
[115:12.81]Listen, don't look.
[115:13.69]Don't look, Jerma.
[115:14.65]I got this.
[115:15.55]Oh, what is he doing?
[115:16.73]What are you doing?
[115:19.24]Vinny, quick question.
[115:20.20]What's your favorite oil?
[115:22.53]Don't answer that.
[115:23.37]That's somebody from yesterday.
[115:26.27]What?
[115:27.39]I mean, you can answer it.
[115:28.21]I'm curious.
[115:30.05]Okay.
[115:32.63]Light olive oil to cook with?
[115:34.53]Or are you talking about, like, essential oils?
[115:36.99]Because I like, like, lemongrass.
[115:40.75]It was a very vague question yesterday, and I gave pretty similar answers.
[115:45.53]Alright.
[115:46.75]You ready for the pig?
[115:48.46]Yeah, I'm ready.
[115:48.96]We're prepared.
[115:49.66]We're upgraded.
[115:51.06]Wait.
[115:51.36]I wanted to pet that.
[115:54.26]Okay.
[115:58.87]It's not going to aggro until we attack it.
[116:00.01]Okay.
[116:01.89]I'm sorry.
[116:02.25]I was just collecting a ball.
[116:06.71]Can we pet the big monster?
[116:09.41]That'd be kind of funny.
[116:11.47]Yeah, your chat is bleeding into mine, because now they're saying, honest to goodness, let's hunt.
[116:15.93]Like, they're just, they're just like... Alright, I think we focus, people are saying focus on one of the legs.
[116:21.32]Let's focus on the back left leg.
[116:24.02]Okay.
[116:24.30]That's a good idea.
[116:26.16]Sure.
[116:27.16]Alright, I'm gonna, I'm gonna engage.
[116:28.46]Engage.
[116:29.68]In three, two, one.
[116:35.05]Let's go!
[116:42.72]Oh my goodness.
[116:48.78]120 damage.
[116:50.48]Dude, I was so useless up until about 15 seconds ago.
[116:59.83]Nice, nice, nice.
[117:00.75]Here, get that damage.
[117:03.15]Nice.
[117:04.69]Wait, build the bulwark.
[117:07.25]Oh, I built it.
[117:08.19]Bulwark, go!
[117:17.27]Okay, that was weird.
[117:24.16]It fucking worked.
[117:26.42]It did.
[117:28.44]I have a bulwark over here now.
[117:29.46]Yeah, I do.
[117:30.48]Pull him over here.
[117:34.44]Get him to run into this.
[117:39.47]Come and get me.
[117:44.75]Bumped his head.
[117:50.83]Oh, what?
[117:52.57]Get that damage!
[117:53.23]Ooh, get the tail!
[117:54.55]400 damage!
[118:08.84]One, two...
[118:12.10]God damn it.
[118:12.60]That would have been awesome.
[118:13.60]Yeah, same.
[118:14.10]I also, at the exact same time, missed my big attack.
[118:18.64]Alright.
[118:21.34]At least we're doing damage.
[118:22.37]Yeah.
[118:22.61]And we know how to, like, play the game and stuff.
[118:28.83]Vinny, have you noticed that this hog has jiggle physics in its ass?
[118:32.23]Mods.
[118:33.15]Mods.
[118:39.19]Please.
[118:44.26]Remove this delinquent.
[118:47.56]Where did he go?
[118:49.26]I don't know.
[118:49.64]He's gone.
[118:50.04]I don't see him on the map.
[118:52.40]Oh, wait.
[118:52.74]No.
[118:53.00]Yeah.
[118:53.18]He's at the blue.
[118:55.50]Go to the blue.
[119:02.83]There it is.
[119:03.17]Alright.
[119:06.37]Re-engaging.
[119:14.21]Bulwarking.
[119:15.17]Bulwark up.
[119:15.47]Oh, it worked.
[119:15.79]I think.
[119:15.95]Maybe.
[119:16.07]I'm not sure.
[119:16.35]Big hit.
[119:17.85]Nice.
[119:18.05]Worked.
[119:18.23]222 damage.
[119:20.39]Nice.
[119:21.19]Sick.
[119:21.57]Oh, 480. 448.
[119:41.68]Kimono weaknesses become apparent in battle.
[119:44.06]Oh, I see, I see, I see.
[119:45.54]You can steal... Those blue areas are their weak points, and you can steal thread from them.
[119:53.81]Grab onto with R, B, and A. Then you can extract thread.
[120:02.26]Oh, that was a pretty cool move.
[120:05.70]He's got, like, horns now.
[120:06.98]He's got, like, antlers.
[120:10.92]Like, I'm on top of the thing now.
[120:15.32]That's weird.
[120:17.16]So, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[120:18.12]So I can get on, and then I can extract the bread.
[120:19.91]Wait, wait, if you do that, you might be, I think you're distracting.
[120:26.97]Oh, you get, like, a massive abundance of materials.
[120:29.51]You exceed your limit.
[120:31.30]So you can build, like, massive towers.
[120:37.95]Speaking of that.
[120:39.45]Oh shit, I have no more... I got no more juice, whatever it is.
[120:42.57]Healing juice right over there.
[120:45.65]There's the flower right there.
[120:51.96]164, not bad.
[120:52.52]How did I do the spin attack before?
[120:54.16]I forget.
[120:54.54]I can't remember how I did that.
[121:06.11]He's R2?
[121:06.43]Yep.
[121:10.38]Oh my god, he, I, I, I, I, I'm dead.
[121:13.86]I can help you, maybe.
[121:19.38]I thought I was out of the range.
[121:23.97]Oh my, dude, what did you just do?
[121:25.63]I just did the, the bulwark.
[121:26.67]Holy shit, that was crazy.
[121:27.85]I'm gonna be able to rescue you, I think.
[121:30.71]You just bounce around.
[121:31.53]Three, two, one.
[121:33.03]Wow, MVP.
[121:35.99]I always said VIP, but you know what?
[121:39.09]That works, too.
[121:41.46]Oh my god!
[121:51.61]Ready to go.
[121:53.81]Die!
[121:56.67]Can't see shit.
[122:02.48]No!
[122:02.98]Alright, he's almost dead.
[122:07.38]Okay, I wasted a bulwark, but that's fine.
[122:13.96]Isn't it so crazy that oil gives us energy?
[122:16.82]This weird goop gives us energy.
[122:18.50]Why is this dude in my chat?
[122:20.79]I don't know.
[122:21.37]I apologize.
[122:24.77]Is this what was happening yesterday for you as well?
[122:27.05]Yeah, everybody got on this oil thing.
[122:29.55]I was like, okay.
[122:31.71]Feel free to permanently ban that guy.
[122:33.91]no it's okay I I understand he just likes the wonders of oil I guess like it it propels vehicles and like you can cook with it and use it like on like skin like use it in the future I get it like I understand I'm kind of like team oil now yes Jerm oh no I was making so I was going every time I touched one of these things
[123:00.29]It really wants us to use these zip lines, but we're just like, let's run instead.
[123:06.01]In that game against the storm, I choose oil as my first boon chat.
[123:10.79]So that's weird.
[123:12.03]Ready?
[123:13.41]Yeah.
[123:13.94]Fast travel time.
[123:14.80]Let's go for it.
[123:15.40]Check it out.
[123:16.52]Bang.
[123:22.78]Nice.
[123:25.59]Please don't tell me you cook food with crude oil.
[123:29.19]Yeah, we so fucked up.
[123:33.79]Like you run out of oil, it's like.
[123:35.02]Alright, I'll just grab it from my car, I guess.
[123:40.06]Ooh, that hurt.
[123:43.78]I gotta get on one of those crates.
[123:44.86]Full work.
[123:52.44]Got it.
[123:54.00]Nice, OK.
[123:55.25]Do your biggest combo.
[123:57.23]Biggest combo.
[123:58.31]Unleash it now.
[124:06.04]Uh oh.
[124:10.22]Oh no.
[124:12.28]Sorry, that was an awful noise, but yeah, I'm dead.
[124:15.72]Awful noise?
[124:16.46]I didn't hear anything.
[124:17.06]I think you peaked so much that I didn't hear you.
[124:19.51]Wait, I have an idea.
[124:20.17]Oh my god, stop.
[124:26.37]I don't have enough.
[124:31.20]Valiant effort.
[124:33.02]Run, run, run.
[124:34.78]I'm dead.
[124:35.46]I'm dead.
[124:35.98]Fuck.
[124:36.81]No, I'm sorry.
[124:38.99]I tried to dodge.
[124:40.45]I didn't know where he was going to land.
[124:41.83]Okay.
[124:43.27]Oh, the hunt ended in failure.
[124:46.47]Oh, cuz each of us were a lot like we each have one life out of three and I keep forgetting that there's no I frames I'm like, oh, I'll just wait for the iframes.
[124:55.41]Sorry.
[124:55.91]Hey, this is tough You know, we've Jeremy we forgot to eat I don't want to keep calling you by your full name, but we forgot to eat food and
[125:04.85]It's weird, because my name is Dave.
[125:06.95]I don't know why you keep saying that.
[125:09.49]I could call you, like, Jer, or something.
[125:11.07]Like, Jerry.
[125:11.59]I could call you Jerry.
[125:13.15]You could call me David, which is my name.
[125:15.74]David.
[125:16.08]I don't have to keep calling me... All this time, I didn't know that you're... I'm going to talk to you.
[125:23.90]I'll talk to you after the stream.
[125:25.54]Okay.
[125:26.26]It's funny, because for a long time, people were like, Hello, Vinny.
[125:30.51]Is your real name Vinny?
[125:32.89]I'm like, yeah, no, that's it.
[125:35.45]I took some defense food.
[125:36.25]Alright, that went a lot better, even though I kind of blew it at the end, but it's okay.
[125:46.74]Well, what about armor?
[125:50.14]We might have, let's take a look.
[125:51.56]Look at all the stuff we can make.
[125:53.38]I already built a bunch of armor.
[125:55.40]Oh, I didn't.
[125:56.86]Yeah.
[125:57.40]So I was like able to tank like a couple more hits to the face.
[126:04.27]This is okay.
[126:05.95]I can make one of these.
[126:08.59]Is Vinny short for Dave?
[126:09.85]Yes, it is actually.
[126:11.29]It's a lot of fire damage.
[126:13.31]I'm losing from these.
[126:16.67]These are the Dave's I know.
[126:17.87]I know these are the Dave's I know.
[126:21.23]Can't hurt.
[126:21.61]I'm just going to make the just the regular gear.
[126:33.83]Better than what I had on.
[126:37.95]I don't think I want to put these on.
[126:42.51]Chat, do I have to bring these balls with me or do they just like do this automatically?
[126:46.20]We're at 97% facecam turning on.
[126:57.15]It's close.
[126:58.19]No, they've been good.
[126:59.03]Give me one second.
[126:59.67]They've been good.
[127:01.07]I'll turn it on.
[127:02.29]One sec.
[127:03.59]I'm actually going to open your stream to see if you do it.
[127:12.60]I feel like it's a bit incoming, but I don't know.
[127:15.30]What's up?
[127:16.64]Nothing.
[127:17.94]No, I'm not joking or anything.
[127:19.56]I'm just turning it on for a minute.
[127:25.78]What's up?
[127:27.70]There you go.
[127:28.50]Look, I'm normal.
[127:30.34]Oh, yeah, there he is.
[127:31.12]Normal.
[127:31.62]Normal Jeremy.
[127:32.24]I'm just normal.
[127:33.16]Everyone was like, hey, what's wrong with you?
[127:39.06]Man, I wish I had.
[127:39.80]I wish I had that kind of balls.
[127:43.59]Oh, wait, I do in game.
[127:46.95]This is the once every eight weeks base camp.
[127:54.59]There was a point where people saw my face once a year.
[127:57.62]Like, that was, like, pretty much, like, for just some weird special occasion thing.
[128:01.48]I like that.
[128:04.46]It was fine.
[128:04.94]Alright, I've eaten.
[128:08.01]I'm ready.
[128:10.27]Let me do one more thing real quick, because I want to get this down.
[128:18.11]Well...
[128:25.30]Okay.
[128:28.26]That's jumping splash.
[128:29.32]I want to get it down.
[128:31.36]For a while, I thought V-Dub was an actual different person.
[128:34.18]Chat member, that is a different person.
[128:35.96]V-Dub is a different human being entirely.
[128:39.12]Everyone.
[128:54.14]thousand damage but why was it doing that what the hell okay I think I get it I get it I get it I'm gonna try the the bow for a minute I want to see what that's like good idea
[129:27.06]It's all about the timing.
[129:27.76]You got to go like swing, boink, then swing now, then swing.
[129:33.62]Line it up.
[129:37.44]I feel like I'm going to use this combo a lot.
[129:42.68]Arrow switch.
[129:51.43]This is pretty cool.
[129:56.22]shoot Otoya where the Haya landed?
[129:57.88]I don't know what that means.
[130:01.54]So is it one single shot or do you do more than one?
[130:04.77]You can do a couple different things, but I think... Huh.
[130:11.85]Is there like a perfect zone?
[130:12.55]Oh, you have to switch.
[130:14.57]I see.
[130:14.93]So when you charge, you can like shoot the area you just shot and it does more damage and they explode the other arrows.
[130:25.27]Like, yeah, the arrows get stuck in there and then you can make them explode.
[130:30.73]It's weird.
[130:35.02]That seems like an Omega shot.
[130:36.96]Oh my gosh.
[130:37.70]Climb crate and then RT mid jump.
[130:46.39]I feel like jumping off of the crates with the hammer seems like that's the way to do it.
[130:53.35]Yeah.
[130:53.69]I'm going to only attack by jumping off and just hitting Y. Heavy attack.
[130:59.40]It's just too good.
[130:59.98]It's just too good.
[131:00.82]You know what I mean?
[131:01.93]Yeah.
[131:03.31]Yeah, I mean, if you find the weapon that works for you... Honestly, the sword was also kind of broken, so... I was pretty happy about that.
[131:10.94]Alright.
[131:12.38]But I think this bow is pretty amazing.
[131:14.64]I'm going to try this.
[131:15.80]I'm going to try this.
[131:16.62]Do you want to try the King Tusk again?
[131:18.00]I think we had it.
[131:21.08]Yeah, we had it.
[131:22.76]Let's just eat, like, a good hearty meal before we attack the King Tusk.
[131:26.44]Yeah, I had some defense food.
[131:30.23]It was pretty sick.
[131:32.03]Jerma, do you like grilled cheese?
[131:33.56]Oh yeah, I love grilled cheese.
[131:34.40]Especially when I drop it on the ground and eat it.
[131:37.30]Wait, that's an actual thing that's happened?
[131:39.86]Somebody said that, right?
[131:41.44]No, I just pulled that out of the air, dude.
[131:44.42]Like, you didn't have to tell me that embarrassing moment.
[131:46.31]I was literally just asking about grilled cheese.
[131:48.95]No one said that.
[131:52.82]you sure yeah I swear what do you mean you ate it off the ground like David hasselhoff no in okay in my pre-stream chat today I said that I I was messing I was joking around I said that I ate a grilled cheese off the ground and I thought because people talk to you about oil I'm just thinking like oh they're going over to your stream and bringing up shit that I do
[132:14.02]I shit you not, I was just thinking about grilled cheese today because I watched, like, a recipe.
[132:18.00]Like, Gordon Ramsay just, like, actually butchered grilled cheese with some, like, weird recipe, and I was just asking... Wait, is it the one where he... He puts it, like, in a weird kettle, like, stove.
[132:28.65]Like a fireplace.
[132:29.39]Yeah.
[132:30.55]He's like, okay, we're gonna use this saffron.
[132:33.39]Beautiful.
[132:34.09]There's, like, apples on it.
[132:34.93]Something...
[132:35.95]Oh, yeah.
[132:36.41]Yeah, we're gonna use this expensive cheese that doesn't even... doesn't even melt.
[132:40.59]Delicious.
[132:41.79]Best grilled cheese, Vinny.
[132:43.01]Let's go ahead and discuss.
[132:45.55]Okay, I can tell you, but you tell me first.
[132:48.20]What's yours?
[132:49.34]So, how about we both write it down and then say it at the same time out loud?
[132:53.90]Okay, I don't need to write mine down, but... Yeah, why would we need to write it down?
[132:59.56]Okay, so you go first.
[133:02.86]okay it's uh cheddar in in the bread white bread just simple and then you can also put butter on the pan and then put cheddar on the other side and then you can crisp the cheddar in the pan on the butter and like so you have crispy grilled cheese with melty grilled cheese in the middle it's amazing now that sounds amazing uh I'm gonna tell you something have you ever heard me have you ever used mayo instead of butter
[133:32.29]No, like to cook on the pan or just in there?
[133:38.51]Mayo on the outside.
[133:41.89]Instead of on, you know, do you like butter the sides, right?
[133:45.55]Like you said, you put butter on one side.
[133:46.73]Do you put butter in the pan or do you butter the bread and then put a face down?
[133:50.13]I butter the pan and then I put the grilled cheese in there because it helps the cheese not stick to the pan.
[133:58.22]I'm into the cheddar.
[133:59.76]I would say I would add a little bit of Gruyere if I were you.
[134:03.14]Yeah, that's what Gordon Ramsay was doing.
[134:04.58]I don't know about that, buddy.
[134:08.88]If I can't say the cheese name easily, then I'm not sure I'm going to edit.
[134:12.01]I've never even eaten Gruyere.
[134:13.23]I don't even know what it looks like.
[134:14.63]Okay, good.
[134:15.45]Alright, ready to go fight this big warthog?
[134:18.81]Yeah, I don't know where it is, though.
[134:21.75]No, cheddar is good.
[134:22.59]I like Swiss, too.
[134:23.81]Love Swiss.
[134:26.93]monster is my favorite cheese probably I've talked about this on stream I love monster cheese and people like what do you mean monster cheese are you milking monsters to get it I'm like no now the mayo thing is for real um alright makes it really nice and great wait hold on can I let me pet you scared it I think oh here try that one try that one
[134:54.94]Mayo outside of bread is life-changing Vinesauce.
[134:57.16]Okay, you have supporters for this mayo stuff in chat, so I'll take you up on that.
[135:02.64]I'll give it a shot.
[135:05.08]That's another rat.
[135:08.79]Oh, another rat.
[135:10.93]Yeah, I think we're gonna have to, like,
[135:15.99]I do really appreciate the fact that we're just in the game.
[135:20.81]And we don't have to leave.
[135:21.63]You don't have to call me back in.
[135:23.23]I don't have to put a summoning thing down.
[135:24.75]We're just in the game playing.
[135:26.67]Yeah.
[135:27.67]There's been no other screen.
[135:29.30]Just get in the game and stay in it.
[135:31.44]Let's just kill this thing.
[135:32.18]Why not?
[135:32.72]It's free.
[135:33.32]It's free kill.
[135:35.72]Do you want to?
[135:36.40]Yeah, it's free.
[135:37.00]Okay.
[135:37.12]Okay.
[135:48.34]That would be awesome if I hit it.
[136:03.25]I mean, it's good practice for the bow at least.
[136:05.71]Yeah, maybe get the moveset down too.
[136:10.09]Oh yeah, it explodes the whole thing.
[136:11.91]The whole rat just exploded.
[136:13.21]That was amazing.
[136:20.14]I want to hit this so bad.
[136:32.53]Damn it.
[136:35.21]You can get that right in the head.
[136:36.13]Oh my god.
[136:48.69]Okay, yeah, so chat, here's what you do.
[136:50.09]You have to, like, shoot the rat with these explosive bolts.
[136:54.11]They don't do a whole lot of damage.
[136:56.77]But then you can... Then you can make them all explode.
[137:00.59]It's really cool.
[137:02.06]Here, so... Like that.
[137:06.44]Like that.
[137:06.80]That's fucking sick.
[137:07.56]That was a good stagger, too.
[137:11.08]Already got it running?
[137:13.20]Already running?
[137:13.70]Already running?
[137:14.36]Running?
[137:14.92]Yeah, it's running.
[137:16.95]Kissing?
[137:18.27]Running?
[137:20.78]The game's like, build a tower to chase.
[137:23.06]Like you said before, we're just running after them.
[137:26.34]Vinny, what is the Lunchables tier list we were promised?
[137:30.31]I never talked about it.
[137:31.37]I've never promised the Lunchables tier list.
[137:33.21]I don't know what you're talking about.
[137:36.77]Have you had a Lunchable?
[137:38.39]If you're an adult, have you had a Lunchable recently?
[137:42.46]The ham tastes like water-flavored ham.
[137:45.76]It's so weirdly watered-down ham.
[137:48.94]You don't like it?
[137:51.59]No.
[137:54.23]Wait, do you like Lunchables?
[137:55.67]Did I just insult you?
[137:57.29]No, they're not that great.
[138:00.00]Okay.
[138:00.40]Because when we were kids, it was amazing.
[138:02.88]But I had one as an adult because I was like, let me be wacky.
[138:05.74]I'm like a wacky, quirky adult.
[138:07.50]Yeah, he's wacky.
[138:09.02]I'm like wacky.
[138:09.92]You don't know.
[138:10.48]So I'm going to try.
[138:12.15]I'm going to get a Lunchable as an adult, and I'm going to try it.
[138:14.71]And it was really disappointing.
[138:17.63]The magic was just gone.
[138:19.93]um the notch was good I ate what's up I ate a whole stack in one bite this was um I don't want to say like three four years ago would not recommend this for like a charity or something no I just did it oh
[138:36.62]The thing about Lunchables, though, is they're actually not that bad.
[138:43.02]Look, it's very easy.
[138:44.43]It's just, look, all the food groups are in there besides vegetables and fruits.
[138:49.65]Right.
[138:50.05]Which is incredibly important.
[138:52.79]Very important.
[138:53.41]Very important.
[138:54.27]It's just not in there.
[138:56.05]But, hey, if you need a snack, it's a good snack.
[138:59.32]It's a good snack.
[139:00.94]As a kid, though, I was like, if I eat a Lunchable, I'm good.
[139:03.52]I'm getting all of my balanced diet.
[139:05.08]It's fine.
[139:06.29]But what I do these days, if I'm craving that kind of thing, I just get the Hormel pepperoni and cracker meal.
[139:14.55]That shit's good.
[139:17.65]Yeah, they make like kind of adult versions, don't they?
[139:19.97]Yeah, yeah.
[139:20.41]They have like adult versions and like you get like salami and like like you get like fancy cheese.
[139:25.05]It's like I like that stuff.
[139:27.43]That was a good hit.
[139:29.61]My mod, Jeff, just had rich people food.
[139:31.94]Bro, bro, salami and cheese.
[139:35.26]Yeah, I disagree.
[139:42.36]Vinny, what's your favorite deli meat?
[139:46.59]Can I answer that for him?
[139:48.09]Yeah, answer that.
[139:48.95]Black Forest Ham.
[139:50.89]It is good.
[139:51.95]I do like that.
[139:53.31]It's not my favorite.
[139:55.71]Wait, what's yours?
[139:58.47]Black Forest Ham.
[139:58.99]Black Forest Ham?
[139:59.99]Oh, alright.
[140:00.39]I thought you answered for me.
[140:01.31]Yeah, I'm just speaking for you.
[140:03.29]It's yours is Black Forest Ham.
[140:06.03]It is now.
[140:07.19]I like Deli Chicken.
[140:09.66]Yeah, I like that too.
[140:10.84]Deli Chicken is really good.
[140:12.24]Yeah, it's good stuff.
[140:12.96]I haven't had that in a while.
[140:16.25]I like, um... I'm going to tell you, you know what, since we're talking about food, I want to tell you about a sandwich that I really like that I found on the internet that I now get my deli guy to make for me.
[140:26.49]I'm a huge sandwich fan, so... Alright, cool.
[140:29.80]Because I love a good sandwich.
[140:31.58]I like really good, like, store roast beef.
[140:34.94]That's, like, my favorite.
[140:35.78]There's, like, a little salt on it, and it's, like...
[140:38.78]like store-made like good that's like perfect I'm I'm not a huge roast beef fan but I if it's good toasted bread slice of slice of pro blown on it let's get weird right love that yeah I love that um if you're ever in New York I I would take you for like the best pastrami sandwich you'd ever have in your life oh don't say that I'll literally get on a plane tomorrow
[141:03.49]because I got some good things.
[141:06.03]Yeah, I got some good places like pastrami, corned beef.
[141:09.35]It's just unbelievable.
[141:12.52]I'll tell you about the sandwich and maybe you'll be interested.
[141:15.98]I don't know, but alright.
[141:18.06]Chicken cutlet with pepperoni on top and fresh mozzarella.
[141:25.43]And what you do is you put that in the toaster oven for a little bit and you let the pepperoni sweat onto the chicken.
[141:35.70]You let it sweat onto the chicken, and the mozzarella melts a little bit, and then mustard on both sides of the roll.
[141:43.56]It is life-changing.
[141:45.10]It's so good.
[141:46.89]That sounds unbelievable.
[141:48.53]There was some YouTube chef who said he made that drunk in college, and he said it was like the best sandwich he ever had, so I tried it.
[141:56.93]It's that good.
[142:03.23]There it is.
[142:05.07]That sounds incredible.
[142:06.83]Good job, Jerma.
[142:07.69]The only problem is I'm not a huge pepperoni and salami fan.
[142:13.79]Okay, so you're not into the salted dry meat?
[142:17.64]I like it.
[142:18.10]I just don't really love it.
[142:22.83]That's fair.
[142:23.23]You know what it does?
[142:23.81]It just gives the chicken a little extra push.
[142:26.08]Like, it doesn't really... You don't get as... You can put as much or as little pepperoni, but I loved it.
[142:31.08]Are you more mustard or more mayo?
[142:32.42]Because I think you're more of a mayo guy, I would imagine.
[142:34.91]I like them both, but I'm more of a mayo guy.
[142:37.67]Okay, yeah, I am too.
[142:40.31]You know what other kind of guy I am?
[142:43.53]Kind of guy that is enjoying this experience.
[142:46.61]Thank you to EA for sponsoring this stream again.
[142:49.92]If you want to check it out, it's on PlayStation 5, Xbox, Series X, and Series S. Kind of a monster hunting game.
[142:56.64]You can, you know, get materials, fight shit.
[142:59.88]Pretty fun.
[143:02.14]Thank you, EA, again.
[143:05.95]I'd like to point out that I don't have to say any of those things, but I'm enjoying the game.
[143:11.11]I'm enjoying it.
[143:14.86]I gotta find a time to come out to the East Coast.
[143:17.70]Just do like an East Coast trip.
[143:20.06]Yeah, you should.
[143:21.38]Ross was out here not too long ago, and I took him for a pizza.
[143:28.14]We had some cool stuff, good meals and stuff.
[143:30.61]It was fun.
[143:32.15]Yeah, I was here a couple... Criken was here around the holidays, and we got some noodles and stuff, and yeah, it was fun.
[143:41.05]I could go for some New York pizza, I'll tell you.
[143:43.49]It's like my favorite style.
[143:47.11]Well, I know the spots.
[143:50.39]Oh, I bet you do.
[143:52.29]What do you got in Vegas?
[143:53.43]I love pizza in Vegas.
[143:55.31]Dog shit.
[143:58.37]There is like no good pizza in Vegas, unfortunately.
[144:01.56]There's some that are okay that I've had.
[144:05.28]Vegas is not a pizza city at all.
[144:07.18]This one.
[144:10.96]This is a monster we've never seen, I don't think.
[144:13.15]We'll go to it and check it out.
[144:18.31]What in Vegas is good that you can go for on a regular occurrence?
[144:23.05]Pretty much any of the sit-down restaurants in Vegas are some of the best in the country.
[144:26.50]You're talking about like steakhouse type stuff?
[144:29.66]Steakhouses, a lot of sushi places that are like 10 out of 10.
[144:33.26]Oh shit, okay.
[144:34.68]There's a lot of amazing Korean barbecue out here.
[144:37.41]Dude, I love Korean barbecue.
[144:41.41]Yeah.
[144:45.38]Got McDonald's?
[144:46.90]Yeah, we got McDonald's.
[144:47.90]We got McDonald's out here.
[144:49.60]Oh, nice, dude.
[144:50.88]Alright.
[144:51.26]Is that the same monster?
[144:52.78]I think it is.
[144:54.38]Why is it a question mark?
[144:55.44]Well, there's a sap scourge.
[144:56.64]This might be one we've never seen before.
[144:58.74]It looks weird.
[144:59.94]It has?
[145:00.48]Oh, wait, wait.
[145:00.94]It does.
[145:01.34]No, no.
[145:01.68]That looks like the one.
[145:03.02]I think so, yeah.
[145:03.82]Yeah.
[145:04.14]Let's get it.
[145:06.16]Okay, hang on.
[145:06.70]Let me see if I can build a wacky thing here.
[145:13.67]He's just like in the village.
[145:14.97]Just hanging out in here.
[145:18.17]Makes life easier.
[145:21.73]He's just chilling.
[145:22.89]He's literally just hanging out in here.
[145:28.08]Time to move.
[145:30.86]Ask him what his McDonald's order is.
[145:32.44]You won't be disappointed.
[145:34.40]It's changed over the years though.

[146:17.38]Some weird things over here now.
[146:31.93]Alright, that was a big hit.
[146:34.97]May have exposed some flesh.
[146:50.69]Two.
[146:52.59]He's exposed over on this side.
[146:54.37]Okay.
[146:55.27]Now, Jerma, if you grab that stuff, you can get a ton of materials.
[146:58.77]Really?
[146:59.39]Alright, how do I... I gotta try to get... The run button, and then just, like, jump onto it, and then you continue grabbing, and then you can get all the materials.
[147:07.63]It's amazing.
[147:08.27]I know.
[147:08.63]Facecam is on.
[147:09.16]People are gonna love that one.
[147:10.00]Clip it, I don't care.
[147:12.22]Alright.
[147:12.80]I'm seeing materials.
[147:13.82]Shit.
[147:15.53]Wait, has he got the glowing blue spot yet or no?
[147:17.63]Dude, I got fucking magical powers if you don't even know.
[147:19.40]Okay.
[147:20.70]Let's see if I can grab some of this too.
[147:31.23]Did the pig just say appreciate you?
[147:33.21]What the fuck?
[147:35.77]No, I don't think it did.
[147:38.19]No, it did.
[147:39.49]I swear to God it did.
[147:43.43]There's no way a pig spoke English.
[147:46.01]It did.
[147:46.59]I just did.
[147:47.35]It had to.
[147:48.85]Smoked English.
[147:49.89]Did you say smoked English?
[147:51.31]I don't know.
[147:51.79]215.
[147:55.55]Oh, nice hit.
[147:56.77]Nice hit.
[147:57.37]Big hit.
[147:57.77]No.
[148:11.60]Oh, come on, I landed that.
[148:21.11]Damn it.
[148:27.44]He's washed and died.
[148:43.76]Wing it around.
[148:44.76]What?
[148:45.60]That was so loud.
[148:46.24]I'm sorry, dude.
[148:47.82]I don't hear it.
[148:48.88]It's being... Yeah, Discord is, like, just limiting the fuck out of that.
[148:52.95]So it's not loud at all.
[148:56.57]It's slamming the compressor, I believe we call it in the biz.
[148:58.95]That's right.
[149:02.35]Have we got it running?
[149:05.21]Not yet.
[149:06.43]Now it is.
[149:06.85]There it goes.
[149:07.17]Alright, let's catch up.
[149:16.18]Not really.
[149:16.62]I appreciate it.
[149:26.06]He's like, you hit him.
[149:27.78]He's like, thank you, I appreciate it.
[149:29.52]His mouth moved perfectly to appreciate it.
[149:31.95]It was actually very humorous.
[149:38.79]People are saying that you got a lot of good Mexican food in small places.
[149:41.93]Brazilian, Korean, traditional, barbecue.
[149:44.70]It seems like you have everything except good bagels and good pizza.
[149:49.40]I'll tell you, sub shops, pizza places.
[149:55.00]There are some good breakfast places, but that counter serve deli, counter serve subs, pizza.
[150:01.05]Yeah, I live for that.
[150:02.51]That's some of my favorite food, and it's not here.
[150:04.17]Yeah.
[150:04.65]Well, you're an East Coast guy.
[150:06.01]I guess you kind of grew up with that like I did.
[150:07.77]Yeah, I love that shit.
[150:10.88]He's very angry.
[150:11.58]Be careful.
[150:12.58]Wait.
[150:16.21]That was awesome.
[150:22.81]I don't think I did any damage.
[150:29.22]Did I get it?
[150:30.38]Ooh, that was a good one.
[150:46.39]It didn't look like I did any damage.
[150:51.02]So, phase three is when the horns light up, right?
[150:54.26]I think so.
[151:11.86]Nice.
[151:12.12]Okay.
[151:17.21]two wait what what do you mean two oh I don't even know if that's hurt that was cool though 215. okay now I'm getting it uh horns coming up this game has critical range oh you have to be closer to do better damage with the bow I see
[151:51.82]Uh-oh.
[151:52.18]This dude just slammed through my bulwark.
[152:00.36]Bulwark?
[152:07.66]Dude, let's get fucking weird.
[152:09.12]Watch this.
[152:09.70]Oh, never mind.
[152:10.04]I don't have enough resources.
[152:24.53]shit that was good that was good seems pretty unhappy oh my god that was its weak point
[152:49.02]Get the blue weak spot.
[152:50.04]I do, but it doesn't... If your crosshair is white, it won't do damage.
[152:53.80]Oh, that makes sense.
[152:54.72]I don't have any... Uh-oh.
[153:03.99]What don't you have?
[153:04.75]For a bulwark?
[153:05.29]I was trying to do a bulwark, yeah.
[153:06.96]Okay, I got one up over here.
[153:12.58]Get it!
[153:13.52]Nice!
[153:13.84]Alright, that was like 500.
[153:22.62]I understand now, chat.
[153:23.64]I was just too far away.
[153:25.22]Because this bow is amazing.
[153:27.31]And I was wondering, like, why is this weapon so broken?
[153:30.17]It's because you have to be kind of close.
[153:31.61]Dude, that's why we place this shit everywhere like this.
[153:37.59]Just to be able to hop around.
[153:39.73]So you make a permanent route.
[153:42.44]I get it.
[153:43.28]I get it.
[153:44.00]And then the world just changes as you continue adding stuff.
[153:47.04]So that way it's like... I mean, when people were saying death stranding, I was like, wait, what are you talking about?
[153:51.72]Now I kind of understand.
[153:52.95]We have a situation over here.
[153:55.77]What's that situation?
[153:56.83]You'll see when we turn the corner.
[153:59.97]Oh, the situation.
[154:02.63]Yeah, the sap scourge dude.
[154:06.66]I think it's alright.
[154:07.74]Keep going.
[154:08.06]Yeah, I think we could just keep moving.
[154:22.40]That's a better spot for it.
[154:23.08]That was an amazing shortcut, Jerma.
[154:26.58]Got one?
[154:27.76]Oh, yeah.
[154:29.18]You gotta take that.
[154:29.82]It's literally right exactly where we have to be.
[154:33.89]Why can I not grab this?
[154:35.15]What's wrong with me?
[154:37.27]Hold the run button.
[154:38.03]Press A. Jump into it.
[154:39.41]What's going on here?
[154:41.75]That was weird.
[154:47.92]He was covering my health a little bit.
[154:48.94]Alright.
[154:50.36]Let's finish it.
[154:59.05]They do make these big trees.
[155:00.19]It's really weird.
[155:08.02]Oh, damn.
[155:08.64]I just got my ass handed to me.
[155:11.42]Trying to get back in the end.
[155:18.35]It's like almost some Star Wars in this music.
[155:21.84]The force theme is very good.
[155:24.58]It's very like.
[155:26.72]It is.
[155:28.96]Yes.
[155:30.58]Worth it.
[155:38.90]The bulwark.
[155:39.38]I don't even need it.
[155:59.04]I'm running out of heals.
[156:06.28]Too far.
[156:07.50]Oh, no, not too bad.
[156:08.36]I still did some decent damage.
[156:13.52]I gotta bulwark up in case we need it.
[156:15.62]I gotta run behind it.
[156:24.94]Oh, you got it.
[156:25.40]You got it.
[156:25.70]It is now time.
[156:26.72]It is now time.
[156:32.34]Right in the head, right in the head, right in the head!
[156:34.96]Oh!
[156:36.06]Fuck yeah.
[156:38.64]Oh, that felt so good because we lost to it the first time.
[156:40.92]It's like even more satisfying.
[156:44.48]You can do the final blow.
[156:46.64]Yeah, yeah.
[156:53.47]What?
[156:55.79]What happened?
[156:56.27]That was weird.
[156:57.01]Wait, did I just destroy our tower?
[157:01.11]I just like... I guess I... I don't know.
[157:03.55]I broke a lot of buildings.
[157:04.71]What happened?
[157:05.93]I don't know.
[157:06.41]Okay.
[157:11.39]That was fun.
[157:11.85]Alright, great.
[157:13.61]Back in action.
[157:17.81]That was fun.
[157:18.93]Lego tower destroyed.
[157:20.05]Yeah.
[157:21.75]Charge blue green arrows for level three for volley arrows.
[157:25.60]Can you charge the level three?
[157:26.64]I guess you can, if you're saying I can.
[157:29.78]Why did this come out by the way, this come up like today?
[157:31.76]I believe last night or midnight maybe.
[157:36.29]Okay.
[157:36.55]Cause I was wondering like, how do people even like know what, how to do?
[157:40.75]And now I understand.
[157:58.06]Did you see the land retake its original form?
[158:02.36]By hunting the Yamaugachi, you reversed the influence of the Kemono.
[158:08.46]Minato is but a stone's throw from here.
[158:12.86]You saved it from being
[158:14.53]I don't think he said the Amogus, chat.
[158:19.26]So I wonder if that's the first sort of, like, tutorial chapter.
[158:23.06]Because I feel like at the very... Yeah, at the end of that, I feel like I know how to play the game.
[158:29.66]Like, I get it.
[158:30.22]Mm-hmm.
[158:30.48]Mm-hmm.
[158:38.36]You need only reach out and grasp it.
[158:42.24]As guidance, I can give you only this.
[158:47.21]Hunt.
[158:49.21]Hunt the kimono.
[158:51.91]You know, with brave... For a second I was like, what's wrong with the game?
[158:56.09]Oh, no, that was what was wrong with me.
[158:58.03]It's just impatience is all it is.
[158:59.73]What's this?
[159:00.45]I don't know.
[159:15.46]That tower just, like, got destroyed again.
[159:17.54]Wait, what?
[159:18.67]Jeremy, what's happening here?
[159:20.51]I'm just so strong with that.
[159:40.38]I think it doesn't want us to lose the tower, but the pig is lying on top of it.
[159:46.90]Can we get the pig out of here?
[159:48.46]How do we move the pig?
[159:49.50]He's ruining our structures.
[159:58.07]It doesn't take much to amuse me, I swear to God.
[160:00.11]How do we delete it?
[160:01.82]I don't know.
[160:06.15]Here, I think I know how to do it.
[160:07.59]I'll try to delete it.
[160:09.23]It's hog-locked.
[160:11.01]Yeah, I think it's because we got the exact moment when I baseball swung him into that structure, and I think he stuck inside of it.
[160:21.64]That just scared the shit out of me.
[160:24.08]And it didn't even look like it.
[160:26.23]I didn't go like, holy shit.
[160:29.43]Oh, my God.
[160:34.18]Yeah, alright.
[160:35.10]Well, that just keeps happening.
[160:36.14]Alright, look for dragon pits.
[160:37.38]Let's look for dragon pits.
[160:38.42]Over here, look.
[160:40.90]Yeah, the pig is too big.
[160:42.95]On top of everything.
[160:48.13]Okay, so then we can do this one.
[160:52.79]Good.
[160:53.43]Good.
[160:57.49]Believe it or not, that was the hog that said that.
[161:00.74]I want to see the clip of that.
[161:02.12]I want to see the clip of that.
[161:02.92]It was funny.
[161:07.50]I'm just getting the essence of each sentence, you know?
[161:18.41]Alright, I want to see this.
[161:21.11]Alright, Vinny, if you want to see the pig talk, open up my stream in... Someone already linked the clip.
[161:30.94]Oh, okay.
[161:31.30]There you go.
[161:32.58]I gotta... It was very humorous.
[161:40.97]I gotta watch it in a second alright I'm gonna watch it now yeah let's watch it oh my god your face too like did the pig just say appreciate you it looks like the pig is saying it
[162:11.71]It's fucking perfect.
[162:12.51]It's uncanny.
[162:13.47]It's like perfect.
[162:14.21]Yeah, hang on.
[162:14.61]It's perfect.
[162:15.69]I gotta show the chat because they really want to see it.
[162:17.63]Hang on.
[162:20.46]Look, and you can see like Jerma's reaction to it.
[162:22.74]He's just like befuddled.
[162:26.38]That was... That was fun.
[162:33.56]This is a... Ooh, look at the mountain.
[162:37.21]Okay, hang on, hang on.
[162:39.75]That was really fucking perfect timing.
[162:41.55]Okay.
[162:44.21]Uh, look at the mountain.
[162:44.94]There's a mountain.
[162:45.94]Huge, right behind you.
[162:49.44]Oh, shit.
[162:51.06]Wouldn't this be a good place to use the flying vine?
[162:55.68]Flying vine?
[162:57.28]Ah, it wants us to do this.
[162:59.54]What, like to the mountain or to this place?
[163:01.97]I'm ready to go.
[163:03.23]It's an odd looking contraption.
[163:07.73]Oh, right, right.
[163:08.33]Like that.
[163:11.75]I almost missed it.
[163:15.71]So now this is... I think we're opening up the hub world or something, right?
[163:18.22]That's what this seems like.
[163:21.12]Oh, yeah.
[163:23.18]Yeah, I think this is the big town.
[163:26.20]Appreciate it.
[163:28.30]Appreciate it.
[163:29.62]I gotta watch it one more time.
[163:32.44]I promise one more.
[163:33.58]And that's it.
[163:35.20]It's perfect.
[163:36.24]It's actually kind of perfect.
[163:38.59]Did the pig just say appreciate you?
[163:49.55]I love it so much.
[163:57.11]That's like my favorite moment of the whole day.
[164:00.74]Someone's just said that would be a good sub-graphic for a stream.
[164:05.20]Just a close-up of the pig, and I appreciate it.
[164:07.36]Yeah, it even sounded like it came from the pig's direction, too.
[164:10.99]Yeah.
[164:17.45]Yeah, this is definitely, like, the hub world.
[164:19.87]Mm-hmm.
[164:35.75]there's no bunny dongo here chat there is bunny dongo jr though so here's a big kicker here yes hold on this is what what are we what is that some kind of sack is that the I think we carved that off of one of the monsters off of a rat yeah
[165:08.03]It's like those popping videos you see on the internet.
[165:16.43]It's a big payout.
[165:20.32]It's the SCORN goal of the dong fish.
[165:35.65]You weren't very good at that, apparently.
[165:46.07]Oh.
[165:52.99]Don't talk during the movie started to feel at home yet.
[165:59.11]Really?
[166:01.59]Well, good for you, then.
[166:06.95]Horan.
[166:07.53]Yeah.
[166:08.07]Final Fantasy 10.
[166:26.20]Time to go to sleep.
[166:35.13]Good talk.
[166:35.67]Yeah, good talk with that dude.
[166:42.71]Jerma, are you seeing your character or my character?
[166:45.13]I see your character.
[166:47.83]Why do they always wear these jabroni outfits?
[166:51.15]Like in these monster hunting games.
[166:54.96]Like, I swear to God, they have the jabroniest outfits I've ever seen.
[166:57.74]I don't know what it is.
[167:01.06]New armor can now be forged.
[167:05.58]Hold on, let me take a look at this area.
[167:07.60]Your home is a convenient place.
[167:09.48]Alright, so here's the kicker.
[167:10.88]This was the kicker.
[167:12.14]Here we go.
[167:14.54]We are still in each other's game.
[167:18.04]I can see you literally running around across the way.
[167:19.94]Oh yeah, I see the chef.
[167:20.98]Yeah, there you go.
[167:21.72]So wait, do you have a home or is this my home only?
[167:24.42]Be honest.
[167:25.16]That's a big deal.
[167:26.08]That I don't, we don't like, oh, invite me from like something and I enjoy this thing.
[167:30.01]Join off me.
[167:31.09]We're just here.
[167:32.01]We're just here forever.
[167:33.25]Yeah, it's convenient.
[167:34.21]It's nice that we haven't had any disconnect either.
[167:36.23]It's like we're just playing the game.
[167:38.01]Doesn't feel like a pain in the ass.
[167:39.89]No.
[167:40.07]The only thing was we just had to complete the tutorial and then that was it.
[167:43.45]It's like 10 minutes, 15 minutes.
[167:49.09]So we have gear to craft.
[167:54.48]He's wearing like a modern day looking mask.
[167:58.40]I gotta come find you.
[167:59.38]Can I use this stuff here?
[168:15.96]Oh, sick.
[168:17.44]Oh, man.
[168:18.06]You can make ornaments.
[168:20.50]Okay, Vinny.
[168:21.30]I'm going to need you to do something for me.
[168:23.56]Just stay right there.
[168:24.73]Just turn around and look over here when I tell you.
[168:30.97]Okay, go ahead and look.
[168:31.83]You had the exact same idea.
[168:33.29]I was about to do the same thing.
[168:34.89]Yep.
[168:37.05]That's the... You put this... Oh, my God.
[168:39.32]Don't kill anybody.
[168:42.38]How do I get up there, though?
[168:44.54]Like, if I want to go up there, I wonder if there's a way to do that.
[168:48.02]Oh, yeah, there is.
[168:48.98]Oh, you put it in your hair.
[168:49.90]We do have new materials from that pig, so...
[169:11.08]oh yeah where's I gotta find the uh the forge over by uh by me wait what happens when you jump into the water oh you just die cool what is that 40 40 what is that like elemental damage a 40 of oe
[169:42.93]Oh, this is... Okay.
[169:48.63]So that's more damage.
[169:50.29]And so when it topples over, I do 13% more damage if they're toppled over.
[169:55.50]What is nimble fingered?
[170:00.14]Oh, I can... Yeah, I can do this now.
[170:01.90]I can upgrade the sword.
[170:04.84]Fair thread.
[170:05.86]What does that do?
[170:07.84]Inhibits stamina loss when Karakuri thread has run out.
[170:16.02]If I want to keep going down this path, I need to kill the King Tusk probably a few more times.
[170:24.48]Armor mods?
[170:25.44]I'm not sure if I forged a new weapon or if I just put... Oh, enhance.
[170:29.53]There's a button that says enhance.
[170:42.30]I see.
[170:43.45]Okay, now that's the next level.
[170:44.95]Oh, and I can upgrade to the Creeping Vine Nodachi.
[170:48.89]This is centered.
[170:49.73]What does that mean?
[170:52.11]That was like E3 gamer talk right there.
[170:55.51]Centered?
[170:56.05]Yeah.
[170:56.71]Hold on.
[170:57.27]I kind of just glossed over everything it just told me.
[171:02.08]Strong Arm Spirit.
[171:05.40]It's like an evil meter.
[171:08.73]Final blow.
[171:09.27]Boost attack power against toppled kimono.
[171:11.13]Boost the chance of landing critical hits for a while when hunter's arm is activated.
[171:14.33]I don't know what that is.
[171:15.25]I might have just beansed it.
[171:17.79]Is there an undo?
[171:19.07]Oh, fuck.
[171:19.79]No.
[171:23.72]Used materials will be returned.
[171:25.30]Oh, it's only a gold cost.
[171:27.46]Yeah, that's easy.
[171:28.94]No, I didn't blow it, chat.
[171:29.88]It's all good.
[171:31.18]You can get your materials back.
[171:33.14]Oh, that's good to know.
[171:35.68]So we need to talk to the person over here.
[171:38.10]How you doing, by the way?
[171:38.78]You good to do like another monster?
[171:40.30]Are you good?
[171:41.41]I can do one more fight.
[171:42.55]Okay.
[171:43.63]One more.
[171:44.17]If you want to go like kill or topple a rat or like some weird slime or something.
[171:49.43]Yeah, let's go.
[171:50.73]Let's try to find the next monster.
[171:56.00]Yeah, we'll do one more.
[172:00.22]This thing has like a running fire swing.
[172:05.07]This thing's just burning now.
[172:06.27]Oh, that's the new thing I got.
[172:08.45]Alright, that's cool.
[172:10.37]I get it.
[172:11.19]So that's like fire damage.
[172:12.29]Of course it is.
[172:14.65]Human path modification.
[172:18.38]Kimono path modification.
[172:22.22]Okay.
[172:23.88]Where did I shoot that thing?
[172:24.98]There it is.
[172:28.48]Wait a minute.
[172:28.90]What's going on here?
[172:29.74]Okay.
[172:33.88]uh we might have to climb to the roof to get on that thing that I made okay yeah oh yeah I had to do that earlier um uh how do you equip a different weapon do you have to do that at the forge uh change equipment so at the same uh that same lady you can do change equipment oh I see okay
[172:56.15]Someone in my chat named CostcoHotDog150, which is... That's a great name, by the way.
[173:02.51]Said, can you convince Jerma to drink a 40 on his stream and burp directly into his camera?
[173:09.52]Uh... I mean, how would you convince me to do that?
[173:14.34]I'm not going to even try.
[173:15.42]You guys enjoying your dinner?
[173:20.54]Not even going to try.
[173:21.26]Oh, there's a ball over here.
[173:27.17]No, I'm not going to drink a 40 on stream.
[173:31.63]Have you ever done Edward 40 hands?
[173:35.59]Do you know what that is?
[173:36.75]Edward 40 hands.
[173:39.07]Yeah, it's when you like electrical tape or duct tape two 40s to each of your hands and you can't like get rid of them until you drink them.
[173:48.34]What the fuck?
[173:50.24]It's Edward 40 hands, yeah.
[173:53.26]No, I'm not going to do that on stream.
[173:55.21]Alright, you want to go to a new location?
[173:57.89]Is that the new location?
[173:58.69]I think the new location is we have to talk to this person.
[174:02.11]Oh, I thought they were in the new location.
[174:04.19]Yeah.
[174:05.91]Time to move.
[174:07.45]Wait.
[174:09.41]Oh, I think you have to do it, actually.
[174:11.19]I'll do it, yeah.
[174:16.78]Someone said, I heard you talking about Edward Fortyhand, so I joined your stream instead.
[174:21.06]That's sick.
[174:21.46]You know what would be cool?
[174:22.88]If everyone came to my stream and just like...
[174:26.57]followed my stream.
[174:27.53]That would be really cool.
[174:30.17]You should do that.
[174:32.15]And based.
[174:32.81]Do it right now.
[174:34.49]There are almost 12,000 people here right now.
[174:38.73]All of you better go follow Vinny's stream right now.
[174:41.60]You better do it right now.
[174:46.10]What's going on?
[174:47.36]I'll just have to get you to drink a 40 at some point, but it's fine.
[174:51.46]It's making the bridge repairs on the old blossom trail impossible apparently.
[174:56.08]I'm already followed.
[174:57.05]Based.
[174:58.79]This is an ad for EA, but for Vinny.
[175:01.53]I suppose so.
[175:02.15]Wait, why can't it be both?
[175:05.35]It can be both.
[175:09.99]Talk to Toga.
[175:10.99]We have to talk to Toga.
[175:13.56]Haim, is it Hime or Haim?
[175:15.28]I don't know how to pronounce that.
[175:17.02]I don't know.
[175:22.60]Because I'm not the host, I can just sit here.
[175:23.86]Wait, can I emote?
[175:24.98]How do I do emote?
[175:26.28]There probably is emote, right?
[175:27.96]They're right on the D-pad.
[175:35.41]Chat, I swear to God, I thought this was a person with no face.
[175:39.41]Like, I thought that was their shoulders and their head was missing.
[175:44.87]Free input.
[175:49.15]Oh.
[175:54.03]Okay, you are... Dude, everybody just left your stream.
[175:55.65]The heck?
[176:10.90]Lots of cool and based chat members that have just entered my channel.
[176:15.39]Very nice, very cool.
[176:20.85]I promise you, new chat members, I will not drink a 40, I will not be on camera, I will not eat a grilled cheese off the ground.
[176:27.10]That seems like a little... I don't know why you wouldn't... No, you shouldn't.
[176:35.77]It's not the best deal for these new viewers, but I can make a funny noise once in a while.
[176:40.25]Let's hear it.
[176:40.97]Give us a funny noise.
[176:46.21]What's your best funny noise besides that one?
[176:49.25]I'll go first.
[176:50.09]Okay.
[176:50.33]That just sounds like you ate a grilled cheese off the ground.
[176:56.64]They are not good.
[176:57.40]They're not being good.
[176:59.34]Facecam should be revoked.
[177:00.76]It is my earnest wish that you oblige them also.
[177:17.50]show him the ai snake well there's an ai version of me like shorting out and making like really bizarre like death throw noises that was a pretty funny noise I thought I got this that was really good actually that was pretty good yeah hello my name is tinky winky I'm a teletubby how you doing hey

[177:44.24]Which Teletubby is you?
[177:46.45]I'm the one that is orange, I think.
[177:51.59]That's actually... Oh, my God.
[177:53.49]We could start a TV show with these two fucking voices.
[177:56.17]Oh, my God.
[177:56.85]Hey, welcome to the Funny Kids Programming Show.
[178:02.22]Yep.
[178:03.87]Yeah, you know, but on the paper one, I make all the rules, you know what I'm saying?
[178:07.20]That's kind of like Peter Griffin.
[178:09.82]I don't know what you're talking about, Lois.
[178:11.60]I mean, I never even once sounded like Peter Griffin.
[178:15.08]Vinny, you are not sponsored to play this, but can I like just commission you right now to like just on my stream?
[178:22.78]You can mute your stream.
[178:23.94]Can you just do that, but say like what platforms this is on?
[178:29.17]I don't know what platforms it's on.
[178:32.79]It's on Xbox, X and S, PS5, and PC.
[178:37.27]Just mute your stream until it only comes through my stream, because I have the sponsor.
[178:42.09]Oh.
[178:43.47]Okay.
[178:44.53]So, excuse me, Vinny, where could I get this if I wanted to play it?
[178:49.33]I'd be happy to tell you, Jamer.
[178:52.11]Well, it's on Xbox Series S and X.
[178:57.88]It's also on PC and PlayStation 5.
[179:01.29]How you doing?
[179:04.19]Somebody said he already forgot.
[179:08.38]No, I got it right.
[179:09.28]No, you got it right.
[179:11.28]No, that was good.
[179:12.36]That was actually really good.
[179:13.84]Thanks, man.
[179:14.48]Hey, thanks.
[179:15.38]That's free, by the way.
[179:17.14]You could have that one.
[179:17.88]Yeah, that was free.
[179:20.32]Like I said earlier, I'm just happy to be here.
[179:22.42]I love playing games with you, dude.
[179:24.14]It's fun.
[179:25.86]Yeah, I'm glad we started doing this more often.
[179:28.61]Exactly.
[179:29.03]That's exactly what I was going to say.
[179:30.67]I appreciate you, Jerma.
[179:32.87]Appreciate you.
[179:34.91]Appreciate it.
[179:43.39]I appreciate this.
[179:45.75]So where are we going?
[179:48.40]We got to kill one more monster.
[179:55.26]Head to Spirit Island.
[179:57.42]So I guess we have to find the exit.
[180:00.33]Are you near the exit?
[180:02.29]I don't think I can activate it.
[180:03.67]I think you have to.
[180:05.31]I'm very interested in this, though.
[180:09.84]The Costco hot dog person said you're one step closer to gaining his trust.
[180:15.56]Like, I'm not going to have him drink a 40 for you.
[180:18.66]Like, I can't force Jerma to do anything.
[180:20.68]So don't, like, stop, Costco hot dog person.
[180:23.55]You're weird.
[180:24.69]Yeah, relax.
[180:26.83]Oh, dude, right here, yeah.
[180:28.43]So here, I'll depart us.
[180:30.81]There are so many options here.
[180:32.61]I don't even... People are going to go absolutely nuts with this.
[180:39.60]There's like dummies, there's training dummies, there's bulwarks, there's a lot of stuff here.
[180:51.15]Honestly, yeah, there's a ton of things.
[180:53.99]This is like a trap.
[180:56.16]Powerful leverage brings down a massive hammer with terrifying force.
[180:58.96]A single blow can stop a kimono in its tracks and crush any horror.
[181:02.06]So you can set up like little traps and stuff.
[181:06.40]This goes forever.
[181:10.32]That's cool.
[181:11.46]There's something else to put your points into, right?
[181:13.71]Sounds fun.
[181:17.59]The Costco hot dogs hit different.
[181:19.11]They are... You know what?
[181:20.17]I will say... They're fine.
[181:24.16]They're just cheap.
[181:26.58]They're fine.
[181:28.52]They're big.
[181:28.96]There's nothing wrong with them.
[181:30.82]No, no.
[181:30.94]This area is pretty.
[181:32.62]They're fine.
[181:34.50]I like the coral.
[181:37.08]Good source of bacteria?
[181:38.26]That's right.
[181:39.14]When your gut biome is in danger, just go get a Costco hot dog.
[181:46.09]Can we swim?
[181:51.09]Kind of like... No, not really.
[181:52.83]Wait, why would I be able to... Oh, no, okay, never mind.
[181:55.79]Yeah, the weapons are so huge, they're just, like, weighing us to the ground.
[182:00.12]I... Uh, alright.
[182:02.58]Would you agree that bologna... Or, like, hot dog pancakes...
[182:08.06]Jerma, I think we've reached the point of no return for stupidity and I can't stop reading these chat messages.
[182:12.75]No, go for it.
[182:14.19]I have the choice not to read these and I can't stop myself.
[182:17.48]welcome to every single day of my life I look over and it's just somebody will just say something that's just so just so strange that I have to address it exactly yeah that's like one of the reasons Jerma and I even know each other chat is because like our chats ended up being kind of similar and people started noticing like just the weird like the weirdness
[182:43.65]yeah it was a meme friendship yeah but at the same time there is like some commonality to the to the way the chat I mean I I mean we we have demographics Vinny I'm sure you've looked at this before there's overlap yeah I think as of two three four years ago I think you and I have shared like a 30 of our audience together something yeah that makes about like 40 maybe it's interesting
[183:11.12]weird... weird dudes the same age that make weird scenarios.
[183:16.89]However, I will say, though, Jerma, don't get used to this, but to compliment you, you do put a lot of effort into your bits.
[183:30.77]I don't.
[183:31.13]Thank you.
[183:31.47]Yeah, you do.
[183:32.45]I whipped cream- Jerma, I have whipped creamed an alien.
[183:37.08]That's as far as I'll go for a bit.
[183:38.88]I'll whip cream an alien.
[183:40.50]That's it.
[183:41.00]Can we just talk about how pretty this area actually is?
[183:45.86]I love this place.
[183:46.56]I love the beach.
[183:48.28]This looks awesome.
[183:49.06]This is like Chrono Cross.
[183:50.04]Like one of my favorite games.
[183:51.42]Wow.
[183:52.02]Holy shit.
[183:52.86]You just unlocked a memory in my head.
[183:55.40]Yeah.
[183:56.15]That looks like... Yep.
[183:58.54]I was wondering.
[183:59.85]Yeah.
[184:00.75]Yeah, that game has got some pretty areas.
[184:04.51]Watch this.
[184:05.45]Check this out.
[184:06.63]Let's explore over here.
[184:10.89]Sounds good.
[184:13.27]Let's go up.
[184:16.16]Why not?
[184:20.58]Whoa!
[184:24.71]I'm fine.
[184:25.27]Oh, you can stop midway.
[184:28.85]Like, you don't have to keep going.
[184:30.23]Like, you could just slow down and stuff.
[184:32.83]I did it on purpose.
[184:36.03]Oh.
[184:36.15]We need to... Okay, maybe we put one of those hunter towers?
[184:41.18]Yeah, I could do that.
[184:42.38]I'll throw... Here, you know what?
[184:43.58]Let me... So fake.
[184:47.68]What's with the... Whoa!
[184:49.22]That gave it away.
[184:50.93]no it's e3 presentation dude a dog I couldn't decide between dude or dog so I said dog uh I can put one over here let's do this how about this search oh that's right yeah we gave Jerma a dugsona I forgot about that yeah we all got one yeah we all got one I don't see anything from here
[185:17.00]Okay, I'm gonna place a tower in the middle here and hope for the best.
[185:20.00]Oh, Vinny, open your map.
[185:23.80]That circle is the range of this tower.
[185:28.48]So there is no monster in this circle.
[185:31.25]We're gonna have to keep going.
[185:32.99]Yes.
[185:34.05]Took me a while to figure that out.
[185:37.54]I'll be honest.
[185:38.30]I think I knew that, but I was not putting it into active effect.
[185:42.86]I was just hiding the information for some reason.
[185:45.90]Wait, can you pet the sea animals?
[185:49.76]You can pet the turtle.
[185:55.11]That's cute.
[185:56.05]Wait, he dropped it.
[185:56.91]He gave me an item because I was nice.
[185:59.01]Yeah, they do that when you pet them.
[186:03.10]What about the crab?
[186:07.06]You can pet the crab.
[186:09.90]I don't think they feel it.
[186:13.22]Crabs wouldn't even know what that is.
[186:16.80]Oh, he's not very happy.
[186:22.32]Jarom, I found a cool pirate ship.
[186:24.04]How do you cure poison?
[186:28.19]And there's a monster on top of it.
[186:30.45]Alright, I'm coming.
[186:40.35]My character's going to puke.
[186:41.71]Alright, I'm coming.
[186:53.94]So you are all the way back there.
[186:55.24]Yeah, and I found a really strange looking monster.
[186:59.99]I'm coming.
[187:08.80]Wait, let me get some thread.
[187:18.97]Just sounds like Flipper.
[187:20.75]Chat, did you hear that?
[187:21.97]This monster... Conjure a torch to engulf your weapon in flames when you attack.
[187:27.20]I think I just picked up something to do that.
[187:29.26]Oh, wow.
[187:30.34]Okay.
[187:37.15]Whoa.
[187:43.23]Suno Bashiri.
[187:44.71]Are we doing this?
[187:48.83]I'm fighting this one over here.
[187:50.05]I don't know.
[187:51.69]This thing is fast.
[187:52.35]Yeah, it's really fast.
[187:54.26]And it sounds like flipper.
[188:10.45]Yeah, this thing's quick.
[188:12.51]Yeah, it does have like a dolphin sound.
[188:14.18]You were good.
[188:15.06]I'll come back.
[188:19.42]That's called a dolphin.
[188:20.38]Yeah, no.
[188:22.00]I just wanted to be even more specific with my reference.
[188:24.60]That's all.
[188:25.16]What's it doing?
[188:29.77]Whoa.
[188:31.19]What the fuck?
[188:35.41]Okay, that was pretty ridiculous.
[188:41.42]Do it damn it not in the head Pounders can do alright, so three springs makes a pounder Watch this Oh No, man, that's all Yeah, three springs on top each other makes like a big hammer that swings down.
[189:05.24]Oh
[189:12.35]There you go.
[189:25.23]Shut up.
[189:25.51]That's amazing.
[189:33.80]Oh, shit.
[189:35.74]uh yeah I'm I'm like a little too slow for this enemy right now but then again you have a hammer so honestly you using the um the springs gets a knock down if you get it right in the head huh
[190:05.21]Shit.
[190:08.33]I'm trying to climb up there.
[190:09.63]Stop camping.
[190:18.10]Uh oh.
[190:29.35]I'm out of materials.
[190:30.51]Is there any materials, like any threads?
[190:34.21]You know what?
[190:34.79]I thought maybe the weak point, but this enemy might be too small to grab thread from.
[190:40.60]Ah, shit.
[190:53.52]Did I get it?
[190:54.02]Nope.
[190:58.54]So fucking fast.
[191:05.09]Shit, I don't have any more.
[191:05.83]Whoa!
[191:08.23]Did you get it?
[191:09.07]Now's the time.
[191:09.97]Yeah, now's the time.
[191:16.97]Yes!
[191:19.30]Oh, I got the big hit.
[191:20.18]Alright, he's running.
[191:28.11]I was trying to get some thread, too, because that hammer move is so good.
[191:33.37]You can collect it from a lot of places.
[191:35.87]Someone said they keep hearing the Splatoon disconnect sound.
[191:39.33]It's the same thing.
[191:40.11]It's just like a water drop with reverb.
[191:42.91]Move the threads.
[191:55.54]Threads over here.
[192:01.13]I found some too.
[192:03.03]If you hold down left trigger, you can see.
[192:06.11]What gives you that?
[192:08.01]It's like spider vision.
[192:08.95]You're going to want to see this.
[192:24.54]On my way.
[192:25.50]It was very odd.
[192:33.11]Oh.
[192:36.37]Is this the same thing we were attacking before?
[192:38.07]Smash it!
[192:40.31]Oh, it is.
[192:40.65]Yeah, it's mad.
[192:50.40]Oh, fuck.
[192:50.82]Don't die here.
[192:54.84]What did you just make?
[192:56.76]Pounder.
[192:57.68]Oh, that was a Pounder.
[192:58.60]Yep.
[193:08.26]Oh.
[193:08.88]Opportunity.
[193:11.46]Nice.
[193:12.30]Just did like 396 damage.
[193:13.84]Or 68 rather.
[193:14.16]Stay right here.
[193:16.11]I got 250.
[193:27.19]Oh, that would have been fucking awesome.
[193:29.49]Whatever.
[193:29.75]A lot of materials over here.
[193:45.70]Jerm, if you walk into the torch, your weapon will... Oh.
[193:49.82]Aw, he put it out.
[193:54.62]Watch out for the big sack bounce.
[193:57.58]That hurts a lot.
[193:58.94]I am dead.
[194:05.10]Thank God he ran away.
[194:06.26]Alright.
[194:10.59]Healing, healing, healing.
[194:12.03]Thank you.
[194:15.79]Damn it.
[194:19.11]Smash.
[194:23.41]Missed.
[194:29.43]Nice.
[194:31.97]No stun, though.
[194:33.59]Oh, I got sacked.
[194:35.33]Not too bad.
[194:36.07]Oh, you got worse than I did.
[194:37.13]Yeah, that hurt.
[194:37.79]Alright, seems to be out of that weird, like, intense mode.
[195:01.16]Do you have any materials for this?
[195:03.12]I got no materials.
[195:04.74]All out.
[195:06.04]I think we're pretty close, though.
[195:07.70]Yeah, it shouldn't be too much longer.
[195:09.56]What the hell?
[195:10.38]That was weird.
[195:19.38]Running.
[195:19.62]Alright, materials.
[195:22.66]Yeah, there's a crystal over here.
[195:24.70]There's also one of those dragon things.
[195:30.74]Alright.
[195:32.36]Is that a wooden horse?
[195:33.50]Alright, I got full threads.
[195:39.31]I've been finding a lot of these balls.
[195:45.13]Uh oh, here comes trouble.
[195:52.76]Yeah, this is a wooden horse.
[195:53.82]Can we break it?
[195:57.93]I don't think so.
[196:01.15]Where did our friend go?
[196:03.41]Oh, down that way.
[196:04.37]Very far away.
[196:10.01]We're saying funny, comedic lines.
[196:12.06]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[196:16.48]Jarmo, we're going to do this.
[196:18.68]You ready?
[196:21.10]You're talking about dropping down from...
[196:24.07]I'm dropping down from the zip line.
[196:25.79]I think I fucked up.
[196:26.95]Hang on.
[196:27.29]Hang on.
[196:27.51]Let me try again.
[196:28.27]We could do that.
[196:29.41]We could zip up here maybe.
[196:31.27]If we get this.
[196:32.21]Alright.
[196:34.51]If we get this, there needs to be only pogs in the chat.
[196:40.77]Okay.
[196:41.63]So you're talking about up here and then jump off from here.
[196:45.08]Maybe.
[196:45.74]I'm not sure I did a good job with this.
[196:49.29]No, we're not even close, dude.
[196:51.37]Never mind.
[196:52.06]It was still cool.
[196:53.48]It's not even the same monster.
[196:55.56]It's not?
[196:56.78]No.
[196:57.60]What?
[196:58.26]Oh, this is, yeah, this is like a peacock.
[197:01.12]What the fuck is this?
[197:02.02]Where did the monster go?
[197:07.43]Down here?
[197:07.79]Down here?
[197:20.60]Come over here.
[197:24.04]Did you find it?
[197:25.02]I think it's down here.
[197:26.04]This should help.
[197:27.22]Let's activate this.
[197:28.58]Alright.
[197:30.67]Ready?
[197:30.87]Time to move.
[197:34.01]That's it, right?
[197:34.45]Yep, right here.
[197:35.03]Alright.
[197:35.43]Vlog in the chat.
[197:38.53]Allow me.
[197:40.41]No!
[197:41.39]What?
[197:41.75]Did you get it?
[197:45.42]I certainly didn't.
[197:46.20]I just fell flat on my fucking face.
[197:48.18]Oh, my God.
[197:49.16]I died?
[197:51.06]yeah we died uh it's alright that was really oh my god I thought that was gonna do like ten thousand damage no we didn't die we didn't die we didn't die no we're good we're good we're good alright oh my god I thought that was gonna do like a hundred k that's sad alright uh I'm engaging
[198:21.62]Big hit.
[198:26.92]Damn it.
[198:35.14]Nice.
[198:38.28]That was perfect.
[198:40.70]No stun though.
[198:45.09]I just got... Wow.
[198:46.07]He knocked me into the water.
[198:52.38]Damn it!
[198:59.97]That was an unbelievable amount of damage.
[199:03.15]Oh, it's... We... It's... Okay, this is it.
[199:09.55]I just... Oh, its horn knocked off.
[199:13.67]I think we did it.
[199:18.09]Nice.
[199:20.11]You can do the final blow.
[199:21.39]No, you can do the honors.
[199:22.69]Okay.
[199:23.22]I want to see a hammer lodged into its cranium anyway.
[199:29.14]Crash!
[199:30.42]Wait, what happened?
[199:31.98]Oh, okay.
[199:32.52]I see.
[199:38.40]I think the horn came off.
[199:39.72]That's crazy.
[199:42.38]Cool.
[199:43.62]Glider.
[199:44.06]Make sure you get the horn.
[199:52.82]it's it's also like yeah we don't even have to initiate a hunt we just like are just hunting you can just kind of go wherever you want yeah you can now you can conjure gliders yeah the tools I think dude I'm in a helicopter
[200:17.09]Alright, that's pretty cool.
[200:19.13]You probably figure out what you want to use for a loadout for this stuff.
[200:24.59]I imagine.
[200:24.93]Oh, yeah, yeah.
[200:25.45]You probably choose, like, when you unlock a bunch of them.
[200:28.18]Because at some point, you're going to have a couple dozen of these, right?
[200:31.92]So... I mean, you kind of have to choose what you want.
[200:35.58]Wind Vortex?
[200:40.68]How'd you get the glider?
[200:43.58]What happens when you stack gliders?
[200:45.68]I think you have it now, too, no?
[200:47.80]Do I?
[200:49.56]Is it in that Karakuri menu or no?
[200:51.20]Yeah, it's just, it's a A button.
[200:55.35]Oh, so we just have it now.
[200:57.15]Yeah.
[200:57.97]Or you could just take one of mine.
[201:09.98]What are the physics of this?
[201:11.00]How does this even work?
[201:11.78]I think it just kind of floats around.
[201:17.56]Well, that was fun.
[201:20.46]Are you good?
[201:21.89]I'm done.
[201:22.91]I'm going to go sleep.
[201:23.95]I'm tired.
[201:24.91]But I actually enjoyed this more than I expected to.
[201:28.97]Yeah.
[201:30.57]Not to say it like that, but...
[201:32.61]Like, once you start fighting and getting the mechanics, it is fun.
[201:35.29]Like, mechanically, the game is sound.
[201:37.11]And I like the monsters.
[201:39.13]So, I'm ready to go to sleep now.
[201:41.76]Like other games like this, like in Monster Hunter or whatever, you really do need to play for like an hour or two.
[201:48.56]Before it's like, oh, I get it.
[201:50.58]Okay.
[201:51.94]Because after the first couple hours, we just kind of learn.
[201:55.21]Because when you first get shown this new mechanic, it's kind of like, what the fuck is this?
[201:59.99]What is this?
[202:01.35]I don't... And then it's like, oh, wait.
[202:02.53]Oh.
[202:02.89]Oh.
[202:03.03]Yeah.
[202:04.61]No, it's fine.
[202:06.36]Yeah, pretty much.
[202:06.82]Yeah, it was good.
[202:08.30]And it was just good playing game with you, Jerm.
[202:10.72]No, it was fun.
[202:11.30]I enjoyed this.
[202:13.10]Thanks for... I mean, I reached out.
[202:15.12]It was like, hey, you want to do this?
[202:16.86]So, I mean, it was cool enough to jump in, so.
[202:21.05]Yeah.
[202:22.01]Well, thanks for the invite.
[202:24.95]I'm going to quit out.
[202:26.16]and uh yeah thanks everybody and Jerma chat thank you for like bringing your unhinged chat messages to my chat for a little bit that was fun and uh yeah I'm sure we'll play more stuff in the future but thanks man have a good night yeah you too thanks for coming up see ya uh that was Vinny fine sauce awesome dude
[202:49.21]Because I figured playing a game like this, multiplayer is kind of more interesting anyways, for me at least.
[202:56.85]And that is going to conclude the sponsor part of the stream.
[203:03.55]Like Vinny said, I'm pleasantly surprised.
[203:06.71]Took a little bit to kind of get the feel of things, but it's really fun.
[203:10.97]I have to imagine that there'll probably be some patches for it.
[203:14.92]It's on everything.
[203:15.58]Again, EA, thank you for sponsoring this part of the stream.
[203:18.14]It was really, really cool.
[203:19.94]I very much enjoyed that time.
[203:23.78]Multiplayer was smooth in a game like this.
[203:27.00]Like I said, that's probably the number one feature that... I know I keep harping on it, but I keep talking about it.
[203:34.56]That's really nice to not just be able to jump in and just play.
[203:42.40]Yeah.
[203:42.88]Thank you, EA.
[203:43.96]That concludes this part of the stream.
[203:45.28]We're going to move on.
[203:46.56]I'm going to go back to Last Hero of Nostalgia.
[203:52.26]That was Wild Hearts.
[203:55.01]Available now.
[203:57.69]On pretty much every platform.
[203:59.79]Every current platform.
[204:01.47]So I'm going to take a break.
[204:02.19]I'll be right back.
[204:02.67]I'm going to pee.
[204:06.83]Maybe get some more water.
[204:08.84]And we'll play some more.
[204:11.42]Be right back.
