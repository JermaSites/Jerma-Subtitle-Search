[00:01.30]My tweet is still about the urinal.
[00:07.04]It's alright.
[00:09.82]Don't worry.
[00:10.16]My next... Guys.
[00:12.71]My next tweet is going to be about TwitchCon.
[00:17.21]My next tweet will be... It'll be a selfie in front of the TwitchCon arena.
[00:21.47]Maybe doing the peace sign.
[00:23.42]And going... Made it!
[00:25.96]Here we are!
[00:34.40]That's it.
[00:36.14]And then I won't tweet for like another four months.
[00:40.94]I'll tweet like four months later.
[00:43.74]Just got off the plane!
[00:45.44]Back from TwitchCon!
[00:47.20]Oh, it was awesome!
[00:50.77]You were at TwitchCon for four months?
[00:57.67]Anyways...
[01:04.10]I wish you tweeted your updates instead of only posting them in Twitch chat.
[01:08.46]Come on, I'm a Twitch streamer.
[01:10.88]That's what I have to do.
[01:14.46]I'm not a Twitter streamer, I'm a Twitch streamer, so I'm in Twitch chat.
[01:22.20]There's no Twitter chat.
[01:25.78]This is the platform.
[01:28.67]Jerma, how come you don't ever update your Facebook?
[01:38.44]Because that shit's run by aliens!
[01:41.44]And they're taking all of our data!
[01:59.08]Dude, this guy is woke.
[02:01.50]No, I kid, I kid.
[02:04.04]I just don't really do social media.
[02:07.05]I really just don't.
[02:07.91]I never have and never will.
[02:13.12]Guys.
[02:14.50]Guys, I call Grandma.
[02:17.16]I don't put a thumbs up on Grandma's post about her birthday.
[02:20.79]I go to Grandma's house for her birthday.
[02:23.91]Come on.
[02:33.06]You are the grandma, and I can't wait until all my grandkids, they all come to Grandpa Jeremy's house.
[02:43.61]I'm gonna be so angry.
[02:46.27]If I have a grandpa's 80th birthday party, and my 40 to 50 grandchildren...
[02:54.92]Like 48 of them just do like a little thumbs up on a picture of me.
[02:59.98]And two of them show up.
[03:01.82]I'll be very upset about that because I know.
[03:03.56]I know what that is.
[03:14.19]Those two are the good ones.
[03:15.41]Anyways, we're going to do some more FMV tonight.
[03:20.77]Hopefully internet permitting.
[03:24.89]There's been a lot of weird issues with the internet that we're trying to figure out.
[03:28.25]We don't think it's really cocks related.
[03:30.55]We think it's construction related.
[03:35.55]Because it's been odd.
[03:37.69]It's been very odd.
[03:39.66]There's construction going on outside.
[03:41.44]It's like, what the heck?
[03:46.74]And it's been kind of shutting us off.
[03:51.38]We'll see how far this one goes.
[03:54.53]Also, if you have not, hold on.
[03:57.21]If you have not given a submission to the Activity Book Discord, that stream's happening in a few days.
[04:04.68]This is the last day you can.
[04:06.74]Where's Waldo?
[04:08.12]A dot to dot, a activity image.
[04:10.20]If you want to contribute something and you think it'll be fun, we're just going to pull the ones that we think are the best.
[04:16.50]And if there's more time, we can do other ones too.
[04:20.75]So today's the last day after today where the submissions are all going to close.
[04:25.38]Am I crying?
[04:29.52]I thought I was, I thought I could hide it.
[04:31.96]I thought I could hide it, but apparently I can't.
[04:37.49]I've been trying to hold it in for like five straight minutes.
[04:42.61]No.
[04:45.01]I like burnt my throat drinking coffee too fast.
[04:48.67]I needed it.
[04:50.23]I took a sip of coffee when it was way too hot and it ruined me.
[04:54.13]It ruined my voice and this is just what happens.
[05:00.60]I'll be fine in like 10.
[05:02.34]I sound great.
[05:03.04]What are you talking about?
[05:05.61]I sound good right now.
[05:07.33]I sound very bass, heavy.
[05:10.54]If you've got a system, if you've got like a subwoofer, right now, if you turn everything else down, turn all the treble to zero, turn the mid down to zero, just have bass, you're gonna hear this.
[05:28.74]It sounds fucking great.
[05:29.72]I can hear it.
[05:30.22]I can feel it.
[05:40.78]Anyways.
[05:43.74]Let's put a name in.
[05:44.40]Because the first game we're going to play on our journey through the world of old full-motion video games is Steven Spielberg's Director's Chair.
[05:57.85]This game.
[05:59.81]You have to make movies in this game.
[06:03.18]Here's a potential.
[06:03.84]I'm going to tell you.
[06:05.82]This one will last forever.
[06:09.09]30 minutes or 3 hours?
[06:13.69]You have to pick and edit and shoot a movie with real actors.
[06:22.82]Let's go.
[06:24.70]First name.
[06:33.44]Last name.
[06:40.81]No, I can't do wouldn't you like to know.
[06:45.41]Elbertson.
[06:46.81]Jeremy Elbertson.
[06:50.21]Let's go.
[06:50.51]Hopefully it's not too loud.
[06:54.51]This is probably going to be very loud.
[06:56.57]I haven't done any of that.
[06:57.57]It's alright.
[07:01.55]Ooh, it's very loud.
[07:04.85]Steven Spielberg presents...
[07:13.14]A Jeremy Elbertson film.
[07:14.86]I didn't do anything.
[07:21.82]Starring Jennifer Aniston and Quentin Tarantino.
[07:27.99]This is what you do when you're like 14.
[07:29.93]Penn and Teller, Katherine Hellman and Barry Corbin.
[07:35.87]This is what you do when you're 14 and you're envisioning yourself as the director of the movie.
[07:42.01]I'm gonna have Jennifer Aniston and Quentin Tarantino and Penn and Teller are gonna do magic.
[07:46.25]It's like, okay.
[07:48.15]This is like, what are we looking at?
[07:49.41]Am I in jail?
[07:52.95]Oh.
[07:53.27]Where is this one going?
[08:09.26]There he is.
[08:10.04]Welcome.
[08:11.50]I've chosen you to direct our next project.
[08:13.96]Me?
[08:14.42]Smiley?
[08:16.22]Now making movies is one of the greatest jobs in the world.
[08:20.12]You've got to have talent and intuition, patience and energy.
[08:23.77]Okay.
[08:24.23]And the real innate ability to tell a story and a comfortable pair of shoes.
[08:29.41]Of course, a great crew is also essential, so I've handpicked some of the best people in Hollywood to work with you, and I'll be around to guide you through the process from writing the script to premiering the film.
[08:41.55]Okay.

[08:58.65]What?
[09:00.54]Whoa.
[09:01.74]Just a minor trembler.

[10:14.91]I gotta use my director name.
[10:16.11]Don't you guys know?
[10:18.58]You gotta use a stage name.
[10:20.16]I'm not gonna use my real name.
[10:22.10]What the fuck?
[10:27.70]I gotta use my stage name.
[10:31.87]No, that's not, uh, what's a better one?
[10:34.36]Um... How about, no, that's, that's, hmm... Uh, hat, hatting... Jerma, um...

[11:04.99]Jeremy French Film, I like it.
[11:07.72]Jeremy French, French Fry.
[11:14.58]Jeremy, Jeremy French Fry.
[11:17.68]What a stupid fucking name.
[11:19.22]Alright, Jeremy, it's me, Jeremy French Fry.
[11:26.10]Click on the newspaper when you're done reading it.
[11:28.54]Daily Variety.
[11:29.27]Jeremy French Fry.
[11:30.29]Hired to direct film.
[11:31.41]That's such a child name.
[11:34.45]Okay, let's go.
[11:37.11]The guys at the studio are thrilled you're directing this picture.
[11:40.74]But they run a tight ship here, so they're gonna monitor your budget and schedule on a daily basis.
[11:45.30]Oh, which money do I get?
[11:45.96]Here, take a look, then click on it to move on.
[11:48.70]Alright, let's take a look at the budget.
[11:50.39]Click on the budget when you're done reviewing it.
[11:53.29]Hollywood is filled with stories of people who've cheated their way to the top.
[11:56.83]While strongly recommending that you advance by hard work and raw talent, we do provide the means to cheat your way up to more advanced levels of play.
[12:06.33]Click on the PA Pager button and check the user's guide for details, but beware.
[12:15.03]Am I already getting time to cheat your way to the top?
[12:19.54]Director, Jeremy French for our movie.
[12:21.30]Total budget, $845,000.
[12:21.98]22 days.
[12:22.26]No, let's go.
[12:23.12]Okay.
[12:23.36]No, I'm not cheating.
[12:24.84]I never cheated in my YouTube or Twitch career.
[12:26.92]Why would I do it here?
[12:27.54]It was hard work.
[12:27.98]It was sweat.
[12:49.78]Just move your mouse to the right or the left and have a look around.
[12:55.84]Alright, so where do we need to go?
[12:57.10]The production office?
[12:59.66]Seagull.
[13:02.24]Okay, why is the seagull animated and these ones are the JPGs?
[13:05.90]I don't understand.
[13:06.66]Why is this one animated?
[13:14.06]Stage 17.
[13:16.62]What did she say to go?
[13:17.30]I was talking over her.
[13:20.97]This has studio graphics?
[13:23.09]Oh my god.
[13:27.07]Product credits.
[13:28.45]Studio, theater.
[13:29.39]Alright, where do I need to go?
[13:35.59]This one here?
[13:36.21]What the fuck is that?
[13:41.05]Am I getting, like, the birds coming in too?
[13:45.41]It all begins with the written word.
[13:47.59]We owe our careers to the writers.
[13:50.62]And my saying has always been, if it's not on the page, it's not on the stage.
[13:55.90]So we got you a couple of positively and really amazing, terrific writers, Ted and Terry.
[14:02.36]Ted and Terry.
[14:03.14]Or Terry or Ted, who have their own ideas.
[14:05.94]So learn early to collaborate, knowing that in the end, it's you who must make the final decision about the story that you want to tell.
[14:15.07]So this is your first time up at that.
[14:17.19]Keep it simple.
[14:17.77]What?
[14:17.87]Oh, shit.
[14:18.23]I think we gotta go.
[14:19.25]We gotta go in prison.
[14:47.46]We gotta do prison.
[14:50.36]I'm doing prisoner.
[14:52.54]That was an instant flex.
[14:53.92]Instant flex.
[14:54.26]What am I doing here?
[14:54.82]I wanna do it.
[15:17.59]Otherwise, I'm just a camera that walks around and looks at stuff.
[15:20.72]I want to work on the script.
[15:23.94]Okay, great.
[15:24.66]So it's just you and me.
[15:27.54]That's like the Lord of the Rings.
[15:29.20]Click on the outline so we can read through it.
[15:33.60]Alright, script outline.
[15:38.32]After you read through the outline, click on the sequence you want to use for the opening of the film.
[15:42.56]Then drag it over to us and we'll write it.
[15:44.96]I'll write it.
[15:46.10]We'll type it.
[15:48.78]Isn't it already written?
[15:49.88]Hold on, wait, wait, wait.
[15:52.76]It's already written.
[15:55.84]Okay, interior, prison, day.
[15:57.24]TV news report about Jack Cavella, who's about to be sent to the electric chair.
[16:02.31]Alright.
[16:04.05]Interior.
[16:05.15]Two prison guards watch TV.
[16:06.59]A priest comes by, and the guards accompany him to a prison cell.
[16:10.13]Why is... The priest enters the cell of Jack Cavella, who denies all charges.
[16:18.98]Jack's escorted me.
[16:21.22]Alright, let's go back.
[16:22.02]Wait, wait, wait, wait.
[16:26.04]No.
[16:26.40]No, no, no.
[16:28.20]Wait a minute.
[16:29.00]Wait a minute.
[16:29.46]Wait a minute.
[16:29.84]Wait a minute.
[16:32.04]Uh... Is that good?
[16:48.33]What do you think?
[16:50.93]Hey!
[16:51.47]Alright, the scene is finished.
[16:54.51]Why don't you take this masterpiece, lay it in the script book.
[16:57.43]We're on a roll now.
[16:57.99]Excellent.
[17:18.71]That's the whole movie.
[17:19.55]Alright, put this in the script book.
[17:26.30]Aniston joins friendly cast of Jeremy French Fry's film.
[17:31.36]What?
[17:31.54]The next sequence?
[17:32.14]Oh, that, this is, okay.
[17:32.78]The warden gets a call to pardon Jack.
[17:34.03]Jack is set free.
[17:49.99]Yeah, that one's pretty good.
[17:51.61]I like that one.
[17:57.06]I think that was a pretty... I think that was a genuine, hey, man, what the fuck?
[18:18.67]Let's see what they come up with.
[18:21.83]Mm-hmm.
[18:22.57]Let me read it.
[18:25.41]The warden and the executioner stand by the electric chair switch, looking at the clock.
[18:29.17]The phone rings.
[18:29.81]The warden answers.
[18:30.59]Hello?
[18:31.60]Yes, governor?
[18:32.38]Yes, yes, of course.
[18:33.22]Right away.
[18:34.22]Oh, it seems you... Your girl's been playing- playing beat the clock and won.
[18:38.82]Get him out of here.
[18:43.52]Okay, that's in there.
[18:46.46]Hold on Jack's mother meets him at the end of the hallway.
[18:48.72]She tells him that his girlfriend Laura is looking for For the real killer
[19:18.74]Gar takes Jack away.
[19:19.74]Ma and Jack kiss goodbye.
[19:30.33]Yeah, the music really does not match the tone, you're right.
[19:38.21]That was your first day of pre-production.
[19:40.13]You made it.
[19:40.99]How you feeling?
[19:42.67]On top of the world?
[19:43.59]I'll bet.
[19:45.03]Keep it up.
[19:47.53]My budget.
[19:48.79]Days to write.
[19:50.25]I did it in one and a half days.
[19:51.53]Total budget, 845.
[19:52.29]Cool.
[19:55.98]Uh... Jack is... Tarantino signs on to Jeremy French Fry's new film.
[20:13.63]There's more?
[20:14.21]I gotta do more of this shit?! !
[20:24.35]Come on, compadre, wake up.
[20:26.41]We already did that one.
[20:28.17]I can't do it twice?
[20:28.91]Okay, uh... Here.
[20:36.36]Let's just end it.
[20:42.39]Are those darts?
[20:52.66]Laura stands behind a crowd at the prison steps.
[20:54.40]Jack walks out of the prison door at the top of the steps.
[20:57.09]He takes a deep breath and shields his eyes from the light.
[20:59.33]The crowd applauds.
[21:06.69]So, I think I just have to do them all.
[21:16.30]Yeah, why does he have a crowd?
[21:17.34]That's good.
[21:20.78]I like it.
[21:25.17]So you're halfway through your writing schedule.
[21:26.89]Halfway through?
[21:27.89]Hope it's going well.
[21:31.87]What do you mean halfway through?
[21:32.94]Can that be it?
[21:36.34]I'm running out of time.
[21:55.56]Holy shit, dude.
[22:00.79]You're late.
[22:01.35]Let's walk.
[22:02.05]Yeah, well, I don't want to be late, do I?
[22:14.26]I'm dead.
[22:14.58]Does this matter?
[22:15.18]I don't think this matters.
[22:16.44]I don't think this is the scene sequence, guys.
[22:19.76]I think this is just, like, they're writing random lines.
[22:27.83]I think this is just for fun.
[22:28.85]It's time to get annoyed.
[22:48.44]One more day.
[22:50.98]One more day.
[22:51.96]That's when the real fun starts.
[22:57.42]Okay.
[22:59.02]This is just a test.
[23:00.28]We're going to do the next one for real.
[23:09.80]It's good.
[23:10.50]I like it.
[23:14.65]A grim-faced turnkey is looking out in the dark prison guard.
[23:16.87]Okay, sure.
[23:17.55]Alright, final scene.
[23:20.13]Coming up here.
[23:23.15]Yeah, you actually have to do every single one, I think.
[23:25.61]We're just doing this one.
[23:32.94]All of this might be for no reason.
[23:34.94]I think it's just to get the scenes written down.
[23:40.04]Sorry, that's it.
[23:41.30]No time for more writing.
[23:42.48]The studio needs you to start production now.
[23:45.50]We'll do the best we can with what you've got.
[23:47.24]Oh, fuck.
[23:48.94]Okay.
[23:49.94]What?
[23:51.83]I have every single scene.
[23:54.60]Finished.
[23:55.34]Assignment complete.
[23:56.76]This script is hot.
[23:58.08]What an edge.
[23:58.70]What nuance.
[23:59.52]Now get on out to production and shoot this thing before some two-bit hack steals all our great ideas.
[24:10.63]Okay.
[24:12.77]Congratulations on your script.
[24:14.75]Ooh, working title.
[24:15.36]Now you need to give your film a working title.
[24:17.84]Don't worry.
[24:18.68]You can change your title at any time.
[24:20.46]How about, um...
[24:34.94]Because that's essentially what I did.
[24:36.42]I just put the fucking script in the dryer.
[24:39.88]And just took it out and took random pages.
[24:45.56]FYI, by now, all the major papers and all the online services have read your script.
[24:51.36]So you'd better do something original with it.
[24:53.78]By the way, your script is now available in all locations and can be printed out in studio operations.
[25:04.80]Okay, let's film it.
[25:13.00]Stage 17.
[25:19.14]Script.
[25:21.98]Alright, what?
[25:23.24]Are we ready?
[25:23.78]Okay, your screenplay is done, and it's been approved by the studio, which means that now you're ready to start production.
[25:32.29]Production is tough.
[25:34.06]You'll have to consider every decision you make.
[25:37.12]And because this is your first time, this studio is going to be constantly in your face on the budget and schedule.
[25:44.77]Don't worry, that happens to me too.
[25:47.07]If you plan your shots and you stick to your script, I'm sure you're going to do great.
[25:52.07]I never start production without first hiring a brilliant director of photography.
[25:57.74]Who should I hire?
[25:58.46]Are you going to give that to me or do I have to do that myself?
[26:02.62]Hi.
[26:03.58]My name is Dean Cundy.
[26:05.53]Some of the films I've shot include Jurassic Park, Casper, Back to the Future, and Roger Rabbit.
[26:11.30]Wow.
[26:11.70]One of the most challenging sequences I've ever had to do was the raptor scene in the kitchen for Jurassic Park.
[26:17.28]The excitement of the storytelling had to be told by the images, which was greatly complicated by the fact that the images came at different times and from different places.
[26:26.10]Sometimes the actors were in empty rooms.
[26:28.29]Sometimes the actors worked with large mechanical dinosaurs.
[26:31.35]And sometimes the dinosaurs came from the computer.
[26:34.03]And all of this had to be tied together by the lighting and the camera angles.
[26:37.97]And you're definitely not cut out for it.
[26:39.47]Movies are about images.
[26:40.79]Good luck, scrub.
[26:41.67]And translating the director's vision of the story into images is my job.
[26:46.31]So I've read your script.
[26:47.93]Very visual.
[26:48.87]I've broken it down by moods, made choices about which lights to use, which lenses, and even what film stock is.
[26:54.87]I'm going to overstep the fuck out of everything he says.
[26:56.44]Why don't you open the script and click on the first scene that you'd like to shoot?
[26:59.76]Okay.
[27:01.14]I'm going to be like, excuse me.
[27:02.98]I'm going to be like, cut them off and stuff.
[27:05.16]I'm going to be the unbearable director that nobody wants to work with.
[27:09.62]Alright.
[27:09.94]In the dryer.
[27:14.74]Let's film it.
[27:17.07]Great place to start.
[27:18.77]The green Viewfinder shows you where our master shot is set up.
[27:22.05]Master shot is a wide shot that shows all the action of a scene.
[27:25.44]As a novice, you'll be shooting all master shots.
[27:28.26]Click on the green Viewfinder to load your shot, then the green camera button down there to roll camera.
[27:33.34]What?
[27:34.02]Okay.
[27:34.72]Remember, at the novice level, you only have access to master shots.
[27:38.60]After you finish this film and move up to higher levels of play, you'll have a huge array of additional shots, including stunts, special effects coverage, and actor improvisations.
[27:48.72]I can only film in one place?
[27:50.16]Hi, I'm Yvonne, the hairdresser for your movie.
[27:57.79]It's gonna take about 40 minutes to get Laura ready for the movie.
[28:03.23]Okay.
[28:06.99]Yes, I got... No, no, let's go.
[28:10.91]I don't get time for this.
[28:12.31]Let's shoot.
[28:12.63]I wanna shoot this now.
[28:13.27]Let's go.
[28:15.63]Hi, I'm Yvonne, the hairdresser for your movie.
[28:17.95]It's going to take about 40 minutes to get Laura ready for the movie.
[28:22.31]No, no, Laura's fine.
[28:25.15]I want to shoot this right now.
[28:26.19]Let's go.
[28:31.59]How do I, what do I, what do I do?
[28:34.45]Oh my God, he's in an electric chair.
[28:36.18]Wait, this is, oh, this is going by scene by scene.
[28:45.75]Spoilers!
[28:50.39]Hi, I'm Yvonne.
[28:51.63]The hairdresser for your movie?
[28:53.35]It's gonna take about 40 minutes to get Laura ready for the movie.
[29:01.65]Sure.
[29:07.93]You just killed that pig.
[29:09.11]Okay!
[29:09.83]Laura's ready for makeup now.
[29:11.81]What do you mean ready for makeup?
[29:13.05]I thought this was what you were doing.
[29:15.03]Hi, I'm Allison, your costume designer.
[29:19.56]We shot so late last night.
[29:21.54]All the costume houses were closed.
[29:23.58]I didn't have the priest sizes when I left here last night.
[29:26.43]It's gonna be an hour.
[29:27.97]Sorry.
[29:28.67]Why does everything have to be- What are you talking about?
[29:30.85]We're all waiting here.
[29:31.83]Do you want to wait for the priest's costume?
[29:35.40]No, the priest doesn't need to be in a costume.
[29:41.10]Mm-hmm.
[29:42.02]Okay, got it.
[29:43.73]They sent me on a run, but don't worry, I'm still there for you.
[29:46.75]If you need me, just click on my pager and then drag it over to the place where you have the question about.
[29:51.59]Now, this is a special pager.
[29:53.81]I've programmed it to give you the information you're looking for.
[29:56.73]If you get lost or you just want to know how to do something faster, click on the PA Pager button.
[30:02.03]It'll show you everything you need to know about the room you're in.
[30:05.18]Well, that's another call.
[30:06.40]Gotta go.
[30:06.78]Yeah.
[30:07.74]Yeah.
[30:11.45]Let's go over here, then.
[30:13.05]You ready?
[30:13.43]Alright, we're gonna film the electric chair scene first, apparently.
[30:23.56]Uh... Action!
[30:27.19]This will be picture!
[30:28.69]Quiet, please!
[30:30.81]Rolling!
[30:31.61]Speeding!
[30:33.51]Action!
[30:35.99]Any last words?
[30:37.35]Cut!
[30:39.02]After you watch a shot, click on the red reel button down there to print it.
[30:43.16]That means you'll be able to take it to the editing room.
[30:45.44]If you don't print the shot, then you won't have it when you get there.
[30:48.71]If you'd like to see the shot again, click on the picture of the camera again.
[30:52.07]Once you've printed a shot, the Viewfinder will become gray.
[31:07.71]If you want to shoot a new scene, you can either select one from your script book or use the scroll bar to find the scene you want.
[31:14.80]Okay, so let's... Cool?
[31:18.08]Looks good.
[31:18.50]Alright, what about... Is it another shot from here?
[31:22.00]Hi, I'm Allison, your costume designer.
[31:28.25]We shot so late last night.
[31:30.11]All the costume houses were closed.
[31:32.23]I didn't have the presizes when I left here last night.
[31:35.13]It's gonna be an hour.
[31:36.67]Sorry!
[31:46.14]Okay, we're ready in wardrobe.
[31:47.68]We can go now.
[31:48.60]Who are these fucking people?
[31:49.60]These are people that apparently work for the studio.
[31:51.46]The paint on the electric chair is still wet.
[31:53.58]It might be really dangerous if you try to shoot that now.
[32:02.19]What?
[32:07.19]Why is this shit not ready?
[32:13.53]This is the entire production team of people.
[32:16.77]The first day of shooting is over.
[32:18.49]You can relax now.
[32:20.09]What?
[32:21.20]It all starts again on the second day.
[32:22.62]Here, you better take a look at the schedule and budget.
[32:25.38]The only thing you filmed was any last words.
[32:29.48]This is gonna be one shot in the movie.
[32:35.41]Fuck.
[32:36.67]Okay.
[32:40.13]Here we go.
[32:40.59]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[32:44.81]Pull it back.
[32:46.72]Back, back, back.
[32:47.20]Pull it back.
[32:47.59]I want this back.
[32:52.39]$150,000 for that.
[32:53.09]Alright, let's go.
[32:55.59]Scene four.
[32:58.05]And rolling.
[32:59.23]Sound speed.
[33:01.11]Action.
[33:05.84]Come on, honey.
[33:20.74]Did I just film this again?
[33:22.03]We did the same thing twice.
[33:30.37]Print it!
[33:33.91]Print it!
[33:38.17]Okay, now we have the two guys sleeping.
[33:42.92]Budget.
[33:44.62]I'm at $300,000 for that.
[33:50.78]Alright, action.
[33:52.85]Very quiet, please.
[33:55.29]Rolling.
[33:56.48]Speed on tape.
[33:58.16]And action.
[34:00.46]The scene, Ravenswood Prison.
[34:03.06]Behind these cold stone walls, Jack Cavello eats his last meal, hears his last rites, and at 12 noon will walk that long last mile to the electric chair.
[34:15.25]The world was shocked when it learned of the brutal slaying of heiress Victoria Hemmerdinger.
[34:20.67]The killer's motive, theft of her famed jewelry collection, including the spectacular diamond tiara del fuego.
[34:28.79]Her trusted chauffeur, Jack Cavello, was arrested and convicted, but the jewels were never recovered.
[34:35.75]Instrumental in Cavello's capture were Sigmund Payne and Leroy Terror.
[34:40.36]Magicians, escape artists... Magicians.
[34:43.46]That's Penn and Teller.
[34:45.14]It was they who led police to the murder weapon.
[34:48.46]A pearl-headed saber found in the trunk of Cavello's car.
[34:54.68]I don't want... Okay, we'll print it.
[35:02.06]Alright, is the paint dry yet?
[35:06.92]The paint on the electric chair is still wet.
[35:09.04]It might be really dangerous if you try to shoot that now.
[35:11.88]Well, why the fuck did you paint the electric chair?
[35:14.68]It's wood.
[35:15.60]It's made out of wood.
[35:16.82]Why would you paint it?
[35:27.49]In the dryer faces stiff delays.
[35:32.70]Okay, the paint's dry.
[35:33.78]You can shoot now.
[35:35.40]We delayed the movie for paint to dry.
[35:37.38]You've gone through half your scheduled time.
[35:39.78]Plan carefully for the rest of the filming.
[35:42.32]Are you fucking kidding me?
[35:49.71]Let's go.
[35:51.91]Standby for picture.
[35:54.81]Roll sound.

[36:33.04]I want to do cuts.
[36:33.82]I want to do close-ups.

[37:36.30]It's going to take about 20 minutes to get Ma ready.
[37:40.36]Why is Ma wearing a wig?
[37:43.46]Why can't you just use Ma's real hair?
[37:53.67]Hi, I'm Yvonne.
[37:55.19]I'm your hairdresser for the movie.
[37:56.99]It's going to take about 20 minutes to get Ma ready.
[38:02.87]Alright, 20 minutes.
[38:06.80]Delay the movie because somebody needs to put a wig on.
[38:11.10]Okay.

[38:13.76]Alright, let's go.
[38:17.00]Um... Why would you... It's six days to shoot a whole movie.

[40:43.03]That's a prince!
[40:53.17]Jennifer Aniston's in the movie for one take.
[40:55.79]That's it.
[41:05.64]She's a reaction shot.
[41:07.30]That's it.
[41:08.00]I can still do another one.
[41:12.08]He's in the dryer.
[41:23.58]You're kind of between a rock and a hard place.
[41:26.20]You've used up all your time in production, so if you want to continue shooting, you'll have to trade for time in post-production.
[41:31.90]No, I don't give a shit.
[41:32.76]That means less time for editing, sound effects.
[41:34.60]No, I want to edit and put sound effects in.
[41:36.64]I want to put, like, clowns.
[41:37.66]Like, who's going to be fucking funny?
[41:42.27]Uh, no, no, no, no.
[41:44.23]I'll go with what I have.
[41:47.67]Let's go.
[41:56.35]Alright, I'm good.
[41:57.63]Let's do it.
[41:58.59]Pull it back to editing.
[42:05.13]Editing.
[42:07.84]Alright!
[42:08.80]I'm prepared for this!
[42:13.00]I'm prepared for this!
[42:20.78]We're using actual fucking disks today.
[42:29.67]You didn't think I came fucking prepared, did you?
[42:32.21]Uh-oh.
[42:46.18]You didn't think I came prepared today?
[42:47.34]You didn't think I fucking got a virtual machine running Windows 3.1?
[42:50.64]You don't think I fucking got that?
[42:52.80]There's an old Hollywood saying that all great movies are made in the editing room.
[42:58.02]You're going to take the footage that you've shot and you're going to assemble it.
[43:02.28]Editing is about making choices without all the pressure of physical production.
[43:06.80]You and your film editor will be looking for the most original way to tell your story.
[43:12.46]This is a time for making decisions like faster or slower, funnier or scarier, longer or shorter.
[43:17.52]And this is the place where the director has the most control.
[43:21.50]And for me personally, where I have the most fun.
[43:26.69]Hi, I'm Michael Kahn.
[43:29.63]You might know me as doing way cooler shit than you will ever do in your whole life.
[43:33.83]Editing is always fun.
[43:34.93]By the way, let's now talk about what you have to do.
[43:38.05]While editing Schindler's List and Crack Out Poland, we were also finishing Jurassic Park.
[43:43.35]We used a satellite transmission from the Visual Effects Company in Northern California so that Stephen could view and approve the dinosaur footage.
[43:51.05]But even with all this technical wizardry, we never lost sight of the importance of telling the story.
[43:56.77]This is the editing room, where you'll be creating your own story.
[44:00.47]The first step of editing any movie is to do all of your footage.
[44:04.12]Your PA will show you around the flatbed.
[44:07.24]You know, that might be my favorite, like, stream moment in the last, like, six months.
[44:10.44]The editing process can be fairly complicated, so I'm going to take you through it step by step.
[44:14.76]But before I show you how to start editing, I should probably take you on a quick tour of the editing bay.
[44:19.87]By the way, I'm in control now.
[44:21.89]Your mouse isn't broken.
[44:24.14]You'll be working with two decks.
[44:25.46]The one on the left, deck one, is your selection deck.
[44:28.47]That's where we'll be loading up each of the shots that you printed during production so you can clip out the parts of the shot you want to use in your film.
[44:35.89]On the right is your assembly deck.
[44:37.77]That's where we'll put together the edited shots to make the movie.
[44:40.33]I have to fucking pay attention.
[44:41.49]Both of these decks are controlled by the single control panel in the middle of your screen.
[44:46.01]You can tell which deck is being controlled by the panel because the light on top of that deck's monitor will light up.
[44:51.58]I'm going to go ahead and load one of your shots into the selection deck so I can show you how the control panel works and how to make a simple edit.
[45:00.99]The first thing you need to do is click on the script and then click on the scene that you want to start with.
[45:08.16]OK.
[45:10.78]Use the still frames at the top of your screen to select which shot from production you'd like to start editing.
[45:16.56]The master shot is always automatically loaded into the selection deck to the left.
[45:20.80]If it isn't the shot that you want to start with, you can load another shot by clicking on one of the other still shots at the top of the screen or by selecting a different scene from your script.
[45:31.13]Okay, now that we have a shot loaded, you'll need to find where to begin your story.
[45:35.91]To do this, we need to use the buttons on the control panel.
[45:40.22]The first button to start with is the play button.
[45:43.00]This will play the shot on the selection deck until we tell it to stop by hitting the play button a second time.
[45:53.69]If we already know where to start our edit, use the fast forward button to find the place where we want to be.
[46:02.01]If we're very close to the start of our edit, we can use the step forward button to go ahead one frame at a time.
[46:08.31]Yeah, yeah, I know.
[46:10.08]The three rewind buttons on the left side of the control panel work just like the forward buttons, except they play your shot backwards.
[46:22.25]Once I've found the frame where I want to start my edit, I have to mark that spot on the film.
[46:26.89]To do this, I'll use the mark button on the control panel.
[46:30.04]This will turn the cursor into a clip that I can then clip onto the film so I'll remember where my edit begins.
[46:35.58]This is called the in point.
[46:38.43]Now that I've marked my end point, I need to find the frame where I want the edit to end, called the out point.
[46:43.87]I'll do this using the play and rewind buttons on the control panel, just like I did to find the end point.
[46:49.44]Yeah.
[46:51.36]We want it to be right there.
[46:52.96]I can't get over it.
[46:55.74]I'm sorry.
[46:56.24]I'm having trouble getting over that.
[47:00.93]The mark button on the control panel turned into a cut button once I marked my end point.
[47:05.60]That's to remind me that my end point has been set and the next frame I mark will be my out point.
[47:10.86]I'll click on the cut button to select the end of my edit.
[47:13.88]This time, the cursor will turn into a pair of scissors.
[47:16.46]Cut it.
[47:18.88]Now that I've marked my in and out points on the selection deck, the cut is made and the cursor becomes a piece of film.
[47:25.17]If I like this edit, I can put this clip on my assembly deck to make it a part of my edited movie.
[47:30.17]Or if I don't like it, I can throw it away in the trash can to the right.
[47:33.73]Alright, so that's the movie over here.
[47:35.57]This is the actual movie on the bright side.
[47:37.65]The clip I just edited is now loaded on the assembly deck.
[47:41.17]The last frame of the clip I just cut is on the monitor.
[47:44.33]The assembly deck is active and is being controlled by the control panel.
[47:48.21]If I'm not sure about what I've edited, I can use the rewind and play buttons to take a look.
[47:53.50]If I want to trim a little bit more off this edited clip and throw it away, I can use the mark and cut buttons just as I did on the left deck.
[48:01.68]The assembly deck has another added feature.
[48:04.40]The scroll bar below the monitor lets you jump through the different cuts in your movie, just like the scroll bar in production let you jump through the different scenes in your script.
[48:12.97]Now that the first edit has been made, you'll want to go back to your script and load up the next shot and add that to your movie.
[48:19.51]To do this, you'll go through the same process that we went through for the first one.
[48:22.71]OK.
[48:24.31]I know this sounds complicated, but don't worry about it.
[48:26.99]You'll get the hang of it after you've made a couple of edits.
[48:29.71]Then you'll just be flying through the footage.
[48:31.77]You've still got my pager if you want to get more help.
[48:34.29]Yeah, I know.
[48:34.89]Let me just get to it.
[48:35.73]Let me get the fu- I can also take you through the tutorial again if you want.
[48:39.07]Just click on the PA paper button and then the replay tutorial button on the help screen.
[48:44.52]Okay.
[48:45.44]I'll clean up this mess I made so you can start putting together your movie.
[48:49.14]Good luck and don't forget that you're still working under a budget and a schedule.
[48:53.90]A schedule, okay.
[48:54.98]I thought you were going to clean this shit up.
[49:00.84]Oh, okay.
[49:01.58]Alright, here we go.
[49:02.82]So, we've got... Interior, chamber.
[49:08.36]Here we go.
[49:11.96]Jack is brought into the chamber.
[49:15.85]Good pick.
[49:17.05]Now, if this isn't the scene you'd like to start with, go back to your script and pick another.
[49:21.51]Otherwise, let's get to work on this one.
[49:23.83]Why are you paging me for this?
[49:25.35]You double-paged me.
[49:26.45]I know.
[49:26.89]I was a goddamn YouTuber.
[49:28.25]Do you see my edits?
[49:29.13]One time, I cut 40 times in a tenth of a second.
[49:32.29]Nobody even knew I did it.
[49:33.21]I'm a cut master.
[49:33.79]It was like buh buh buh buh buh buh buh.
[49:53.92]You didn't even know what happened.
[49:54.72]Cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut cut.
[49:59.20]Alright here we go.
[50:01.51]So I wanted to start.
[50:09.51]Wait, back it up.
[50:13.51]Endpoint right here, bingo.
[50:16.51]Now that you've marked your endpoint, play through the shot to find where you want to end it.
[50:21.13]Once you find a good spot, stop the deck.
[50:23.99]Pick up the scissors and use them on the film on the left deck.
[50:27.69]After clicking the scissors, you should see a piece of film in your hand.
[50:31.17]That's your cut.
[50:32.61]Drag it over to the assembly deck, the one on the right, and click it.
[50:36.29]They really, really were concerned that nobody was going to get this shit.
[50:41.62]They were so scared that nobody was going to fucking understand how to do this at all.
[50:46.33]Done.
[50:46.67]Got it.
[50:46.95]Bingo.
[50:47.46]Cut it.
[51:06.88]Great.
[51:07.48]You've gotten the hang of it.
[51:08.84]I told you it was easy.
[51:09.94]Now select another shot to follow this one and follow the same process you did the first time.
[51:15.16]Each new clip will follow the frame being displayed on that monitor.
[51:20.36]Okay, so let's go.
[51:22.42]New scene.
[51:23.78]Here we go.
[51:25.55]That's them.
[51:26.01]Okay, they're bringing them in.
[51:27.55]Next scene.
[51:41.33]No, I don't even want that in the movie.
[51:57.28]Okay.
[51:58.16]I talked to Lars.
[51:58.68]She's that... Oh, no, no, no.
[52:05.66]Go back.
[52:06.64]No, no, no.
[52:06.98]Back, back, back, back.
[52:13.35]Jack and Father exit the cell.
[52:21.03]How do I?
[52:21.37]Okay, that's how you go back.
[52:25.67]There we go.
[52:26.17]This is what I want.
[52:28.76]No, I don't want that, actually.
[52:34.98]There it is.
[52:35.50]Okay, here it is.
[52:36.90]I was looking for that.
[52:37.44]Any last words?
[52:43.55]Any last words?
[52:54.85]Why is it filming the whole thing?
[53:03.81]Back to the beginning.
[53:04.30]Alright, endpoint here.
[53:09.88]Any last words?
[53:13.77]Cut it.
[53:19.11]Bingo.
[53:21.57]Wait, did I just fuck that up?
[53:25.47]No, no, okay, this is going fine.
[53:26.87]Any last words?
[53:47.89]Okay, now.
[53:48.99]Hold on.
[53:49.31]No, no, no, no, no.
[53:50.09]Now I need... No, I need the kiss.
[54:00.83]Can I put this in the beginning of the movie?
[54:03.95]How do I put this in the beginning of the movie?
[54:12.52]I want it back here.
[54:20.11]You know what I mean?
[54:20.65]I want to put this here.
[54:38.90]Okay, that's fine.
[54:50.32]I want this to happen in the beginning.
[55:25.66]I want to change the point.
[55:26.82]I want to change the edit point.
[55:28.04]I want to have it be this.
[55:30.94]No.
[55:31.28]Trash it.
[55:31.74]Trash it.
[55:32.24]TRASH!
[55:58.09]No, why is this here?
[55:59.25]Oh, there we go.
[56:00.67]Okay.
[56:07.12]Hold on.
[56:26.41]It's just memento.
[56:28.29]No, that's okay.
[56:43.86]First day in the editing room is always terrifying.
[56:46.90]Don't worry.
[56:48.22]Everything looks great.
[56:52.08]Oh shit, I don't have very much money left.
[56:58.36]Wait, is this two back-to-back kissing- is this two back-to-back kissing scenes?
[57:13.32]Just make the whole thing different kinds of kissing.
[57:24.70]I want more- I need more time!
[57:33.33]I'm running out of time, so I have to go to the end here.
[57:35.62]I gotta put... I'm coming out.
[57:37.78]They didn't give me enough money.
[57:52.19]Where is it?
[58:02.97]Where the fuck is it?
[58:05.21]Where's him coming out of the dryer?
[58:55.60]Is there enough time?
[58:57.34]Can I do another one?
[58:58.04]I wish I could get a bigger picture of this ship.
[59:23.71]It's red, right?
[59:25.27]Where is it?
[59:28.97]If I can fit another big kiss scene, I'm going to do it.
[59:36.48]Wait, no, that's Kiss's forehead.
[59:43.32]There it is, right there.
[60:04.76]I still have to add sound effects and shit.
[60:18.19]How much more can I do with this?
[60:24.54]Why is the studio letting me do this?
[60:33.33]I thought I was out of money.
[60:49.83]Am I out of money?
[60:50.57]Where's my budget?
[60:53.39]No, I'm not out of money yet, okay?
[60:57.36]I think that's good.
[61:00.04]Because I need to put music in and shit.
[61:02.10]I need money for that.
[61:13.21]Can you put in reversed clips?
[61:14.85]I don't think so.
[61:20.55]So do I- is that it?
[61:26.48]Can I leave here with this done or do I have to put this somewhere?
[61:31.16]Do I slam dunk it?
[61:37.88]Have there be two dryer scenes.
[61:41.64]No, that's- I can't do that.
[61:49.02]What do I got for days left?
[61:51.18]Total days.
[61:51.76]Days to edit.
[61:52.92]Three, okay.
[61:53.86]No, no, that's what it is.
[62:03.89]Wait, you guys want to bring out like more than like two or three people?
[62:19.02]No, no, no.
[62:20.12]We need the you're late.
[62:22.84]I need the you're late.
[62:28.79]That happens right here.
[62:38.57]And he's late because he spent so much time kissing his girlfriend.
[62:47.32]Okay, where is it?
[62:54.95]You're late.
[62:55.45]You're late.
[62:55.93]You're late.
[62:56.53]Late.

[62:57.11]You're late.
[62:58.59]You're late.

[63:02.69]You're late.
[63:03.27]Here it is.
[63:03.59]You're late.
[63:27.09]Right here.
[63:29.97]You're late.
[63:30.93]Let's walk.
[63:33.62]I don't want to be late now, do I?
[63:35.92]Mom?
[63:36.78]Well, I guess this is goodbye.
[63:38.42]I have to do it.
[64:03.61]You don't tell me I can't do it because I'm gonna do it.
[64:06.81]You only have a day left to finish up.
[64:08.59]Take care of any loose ends and nail this thing down.
[64:12.55]Check the budget one last time.
[64:14.34]I threw this one in the trash.
[64:20.10]Hold on.
[64:27.63]Mom?
[64:28.49]Well, I guess this is goodbye.
[64:41.90]I have to fucking focus here Right, um
[65:04.09]Mom?
[65:04.94]Well, I guess this is goodbye.
[65:57.32]I can't be stopped.
[65:59.18]I can't be stopped.
[66:03.20]Oh, shit.
[66:03.72]Am I... No!
[66:04.40]Okay, I got one more.
[66:36.91]Mom?
[66:37.79]Well, I guess this is goodbye.
[66:44.23]Wait.
[66:49.96]Any last words?
[67:21.34]Fuck.
[67:23.47]Okay, we have to go and edit.
[67:29.09]So this is... I now take this masterpiece... Oh my god.
[67:35.03]My fucking head.
[67:35.74]We go to the sound bay.
[67:40.32]Ugh.
[67:52.00]Jesus fucking god.
[67:56.77]Sound effects.
[68:00.67]Please wait while the Foley artists prepare the studio.
[68:13.83]Fuck!
[68:14.87]Okay, I thought he had a gun.
[68:16.47]I looked over at you guys.
[68:17.93]Hey, here are all my achievements.
[68:19.05]I was nominated for five Grammys.
[68:37.75]We're here on the Foley stage, which is where we create sound effects for movies.
[68:41.89]Some of the movies I've designed sound for are the Flintstones, three of the Star Trek movies, Beauty and the Beast, and Aladdin.
[68:49.27]When it sounds like it's raining in a movie, or it sounds like you're in the middle of a tropical rainforest, those sounds were put together by people like me.
[69:01.90]One of the most fun parts of designing sound for movies is getting to create sounds that don't exist in real life.
[69:08.39]So, for example, on Aladdin, to create the sound of Aladdin being chased by a tidal wave of lava, I recorded the sound of my mother's spaghetti sauce simmering on the stove.
[69:19.20]Your PA will now show you how to lay in sound effects.
[69:23.09]That was very clearly you putting your mouth around a straw with milk in blown bubbles.
[69:27.09]It would have been easier that way.
[69:28.21]Record button and the play button.
[69:29.84]Hold on, though.
[69:53.42]just wait a minute wait wait wait wait wait I want to see I need to see if this is going to work what are they what are these sounds oh god that's loud okay
[70:28.25]Ow my that I actually just got I think I hurt myself.
[70:30.85]I really did I just hurt myself Shit no
[70:57.44]How do I definitely remove a sound?
[71:03.84]How do you remove a sound?
[71:09.60]Undo?
[71:11.48]Is this undo?
[71:40.83]What?
[71:43.93]Are you talking?
[71:48.48]I- what did he say?
[72:01.77]I don't hear any sound effect though.
[72:03.49]It should be right like here.
[72:05.31]Right?
[72:05.63]So why is it not playing?
[72:07.49]What the fuck was that?
[72:15.42]What?
[72:23.28]Yeah, why is it muted?
[72:30.58]But record and then play.
[72:33.34]Record, play.
[72:36.62]Any last words?
[72:57.06]Everyone has to applaud this.
[73:29.03]No, no, no.
[73:29.61]No, I'm not gonna do that.
[73:36.92]I need to see what the other ones do.
[73:58.05]Okay.
[74:34.21]something's wrong with me my like right lower right side of my stomach is kill it's like a knife going into it when I laugh what the is wrong with me I think I pulled a muscle laughing at this is there any does anybody like bend over or anything
[75:08.10]Uh-oh.
[75:09.68]We've lost audio on the help.
[75:11.76]$819,000.
[75:14.94]What is this?
[75:15.38]You know, I gotta do it.
[75:16.50]Do you know what I mean?
[75:24.39]I have to do it.
[76:09.28]Print it.
[76:10.02]Let's go.
[76:10.50]That's it.
[76:11.40]I did it.
[76:12.94]Movie over.
[76:14.03]Movie done.
[76:16.81]Add the shotgun?
[76:18.67]No, that's too much.
[76:19.57]That's overkill.
[76:31.82]I know where I can put that.
[76:37.68]I'm almost out of budget.
[76:39.02]Last day.
[76:56.90]He's like, he bites off her ear and then starts kissing her.
[77:01.30]No, no, no, no.
[77:02.40]It's too much.
[77:02.94]It's too comedy.
[77:03.80]Too much comedy.
[77:05.85]No, too much.
[77:06.59]That's too, that's over comedy.
[77:08.26]I'm not going to over comedy this.
[77:22.10]No, that's over comedy.
[77:23.54]I'm done.
[77:25.34]That's, that's comedy overload.
[77:26.78]Done.
[77:34.24]No, I can't.
[77:35.07]I've got to get out.
[77:37.53]I will over-comedy the fuck out of that, and I don't want to.
[77:41.33]Graphics?
[77:51.50]This is the room where you'll create the marketing campaign for your film.
[77:56.50]You'll have the opportunity here to create advertising that'll communicate to people all over the world the reasons they should go out and pay to see your movie.
[78:04.79]If your movie doesn't open to big audiences, you get to blame all the people in this room.
[78:13.40]Okay?
[78:14.44]Most people think that once a film is finished, the movie-making process is complete.
[78:19.38]In fact, there's quite a bit more to it.
[78:22.19]Hi, I'm Buffy Shutt.
[78:23.79]I run the marketing department.
[78:25.87]Our group designs the posters and ads that you see in newspapers, on buses, and at your local movie theater.
[78:32.72]I've created marketing campaigns for such films as Babe, Apollo 13, Casper, and T2.
[78:40.20]When we envision a campaign, we often find the key to it is in a music cue, a single image, or a line from the script.
[78:47.07]I can't wait to make the poster.
[78:48.01]Good lines sell the movie.
[78:49.63]Great lines become part of our vocabulary.
[78:53.01]Frankly, my dear, I don't give a damn.
[78:55.79]Houston, we have a problem.
[78:58.68]I'll be back.
[79:00.64]Let's see if we can come up with something unique for your film.
[79:03.42]Oh, oh.
[79:03.93]Click on the poster maker, title vision, or the tic-o-matic, and your PA will show you how to create your kingdom.
[79:10.08]Poster maker.
[79:12.01]I gotta get a good poster.
[79:12.95]Well, no, it's other reasons, but it still is.
[79:14.06]Alright, let's do poster.
[79:37.62]Okay, that blank spot in the middle of your desk is your canvas.
[79:41.89]In order to place a graphic image onto your canvas, click on the stacks of pictures on the left.
[79:47.35]When you click on a stack, you'll see all of that stack's images displayed.
[79:51.30]Click on whatever image you want, then drag it to the canvas.
[79:54.74]Place as many as you want to work with.
[79:57.06]Once they're on the canvas, you can select your images and move them to the foreground or the background.
[80:01.99]Resize them or erase them.
[80:04.13]If you make a mistake, use the undo button.
[80:06.57]If you don't like an image, click on the eraser and the selected image will disappear.
[80:10.91]If you want to add words, click on the stencils.
[80:13.70]When you're done, you can print your poster with the print button.
[80:17.02]If you have any trouble, use the help screen on my PA page for further details.
[80:52.56]No, undo, undo, undo.
[80:57.96]Use the pen.
[81:09.97]How do I use the pen?
[81:24.76]I want this in the... Here we go.
[81:27.64]Switch to the back.
[81:28.47]I want this in the foreground.

[81:57.07]Alright, how do I use this paint?
[82:38.24]Shit.
[82:40.86]That's the kind of cover that somebody makes when they make their own DVDs.
[82:48.69]I've probably made college DVDs where I had to DVD label maker.
[82:54.66]And I thought I was so cool.
[82:55.42]It wasn't.

[86:12.94]No, no, I don't want to print this.
[86:15.88]I don't want to print this.
[86:18.36]I don't have a printer hooked up.
[86:27.41]In the dryer, poster heralds a hot new film.
[86:29.57]Tickets gone with the wind.
[86:33.64]Okay.

[86:40.64]Press OK to move forward.
[86:41.84]Okay.
[86:42.48]Do you want to change the title?
[86:44.60]No.
[87:03.00]Click on the window to cycle through the title effects.

[87:45.79]Should I do 3D glasses?
[87:53.71]Yeah, I think we should do look at anything else with 3D glasses on.
[87:56.93]That sounds good.
[88:07.22]Ugh.
[88:09.88]That's fine?
[88:10.72]No.
[88:11.64]No.
[88:12.06]Just black.
[88:12.52]That's good.
[88:17.20]Do you want your credits to play before the movie?
[88:19.97]After the movie.
[88:20.47]Would you like to credit your writers?
[88:24.71]Would you like to credit your DP?
[88:27.89]Would you like to credit your production assistant?
[88:32.49]Would you like to credit the rest of your crew?
[88:35.39]It was me.
[88:38.37]Stunt Coordinator?
[88:39.77]What stunts?
[88:43.70]Press OK if you'd like this disclaimer to appear in your credits.
[88:49.26]Disclaimer?
[88:51.42]Select a musical style for your credits!
[89:06.97]Okay, or... That's better.
[89:21.70]Put the lightning strike, too.
[89:26.49]Alright.
[89:31.51]Steven Spielberg presents... You're just gonna slap your name on this?
[89:34.81]Okay.
[89:48.06]Okay.
[89:51.26]Now the Tick-O-Matic.
[89:54.00]Whatever this is.
[89:59.52]Oh, it's the ticket.
[90:00.93]This is where you'll make tickets for your film's premiere.
[90:04.07]Just answer the questions as they come up, and when you're done, you can print out the tickets eight at a time.
[90:10.10]Only eight.
[90:14.04]Do you want your name to appear on the ticket?
[90:15.69]Yes.
[90:17.93]Enter the price that you'd like to appear on the ticket.
[90:38.99]$20 million?
[90:42.89]Nobody can go.
[90:43.75]No.
[90:44.13]It would... Let's make it like a... $5,500.
[90:47.79]$5,500.
[90:48.67]Click on the ticket to step through the ticket styles.
[91:04.28]That one's good.
[91:06.42]Click on the ticket to step through the fonts.
[91:18.06]Alright.
[91:18.94]Are these movie tickets or are these like boyfriend, girlfriend, good for one back rub coupons?
[91:33.23]Click it.
[91:39.63]That's good.
[91:42.87]Make that huge.
[91:53.50]matter press the print button to print it eight tickets fit on a letter size page no they really did want you to print this and give it to your parents and then they watch what you did in here that's why they have a monetary number here I get it it's to get the family in the room
[92:24.58]What do you mean printed?
[92:27.62]Why do I have to print this and put it in the Discord?
[92:30.24]You know you can just press the screen cap button.
[92:33.99]And just crop that and just use it for whatever you want.
[92:40.21]Printed.
[92:40.63]I don't have a printer!
[92:43.23]We're good.
[92:44.47]Jeremy French Fry writes own ticket on in the dryer.
[92:48.21]What?
[92:51.75]We're good.
[92:55.87]Let's go.
[92:56.25]Oh, this is the lab?
[93:08.35]What's the lab?
[93:16.32]So the suspense begins here, because this is the lab where your film will be processed.
[93:21.64]And it can take a while, so we'll keep you posted.
[93:26.44]Maybe we can take a while.
[93:34.99]Start the... I'm your music editor, and I can't help but notice you don't have any music in your movie.
[93:40.65]If your budget can afford it, come back with me to the music studio, and let's get to work.
[93:49.09]Alright, let's put some music in.
[93:58.77]I'm going to put in like five seconds of music.
[94:01.33]The movie is only like 42 seconds long.
[94:06.93]You ever watch a movie on TV with the sound off?
[94:10.07]Something's missing and it's not just the dialog.
[94:12.65]The music that plays under each scene is such a critical part of movie making because it might set a delicate mood.
[94:19.06]It might make us cry or keep us in gut twisting suspense or tell us when to be scared and for how long.
[94:29.01]Hi, I'm Laurie Higgins-Tobias, your music editor.
[94:32.69]I'll be doing the same work on your film as I did on The Flintstones, Stargate, and Independence Day.
[94:37.98]A lot of Flintstones movie makers here.
[94:39.12]A music editor helps create the musical concept and foundation for the movie.
[94:44.06]While working on The Flintstones, playing music from the original cartoon series underneath early edits of the movie helps the director decide which style of music to use in the finished film.
[94:56.11]The Flintstones live action?
[94:58.03]I know, you're gonna have to hit record, then play, then play a song.
[95:20.70]In the beginning levels, you'll only have access to a few instruments.
[95:24.33]But with experience, you'll be able to add the sound of a rock band or even a symphony orchestra.
[95:29.97]I can't do that now.
[95:31.61]Why can't I not do that now?
[95:32.57]Select the kind of music you want to work with.
[95:34.87]From there, select a music cue and the instruments will set up to play.
[95:38.93]To record, hit the record button followed by the play button.
[95:42.55]To play the music, just click on the instruments.
[95:46.53]Okay, so let's see.
[95:49.26]Small orchestra strings.
[95:50.52]I don't understand.
[96:13.52]Why are there pictures in here?
[96:26.15]Literally click the instrument.
[96:33.47]What instrument?
[96:36.26]Oh.
[96:38.30]Why would you have to light off back here?
[96:50.12]What?
[96:53.28]What the fuck is going on?
[97:10.85]Oh, this just turns the lights on and turns the lights off.
[97:17.80]I didn't do that.
[97:23.10]What the fuck is happening in this movie?
[97:25.12]I didn't put this music in.
[97:27.12]What the fuck was that?
[97:38.99]It's cursed.
[97:47.77]Oh, shit.
[97:48.19]Does that mean it's loud?
[98:01.53]Alright, well... I don't know...
[98:15.06]Figured it out.
[98:16.74]Alright, so it's open book, pick thing, click up here.
[98:22.98]That is very dumb.
[98:26.22]Alright.
[98:31.12]What?
[98:31.30]I don't have enough money to do this.
[98:48.53]I don't have enough money.
[98:49.51]I gotta get out.
[98:54.21]I gotta get out.
[99:17.96]Okay, here we go.
[99:18.90]You ready?
[99:30.46]This is it.
[99:32.34]Three.
[99:34.04]Two.
[99:36.04]One.
[99:37.54]Action.
[99:42.34]Play!
[99:44.00]No!
[99:47.32]Why is it not doing it?
[99:49.30]That just costed money, it didn't do anything!
[100:00.02]Oh, you motherfucker, really?
[100:02.76]I-
[100:23.28]What the fuck?
[100:29.22]Oh god, the game's breaking.
[100:30.42]Alright, alright, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[100:45.02]Why?
[100:48.39]Why?
[100:49.27]What the fuck?
[100:51.07]Why?
[100:57.52]I can't record it.
[100:58.44]I don't have any money.
[101:01.40]Alright, well fuck it.
[101:02.20]That's it.
[101:10.18]Print it.
[101:10.58]That's it.
[101:12.34]Let's go.
[101:12.74]I'm out of money.
[101:24.75]Process.
[101:36.29]Is it working?
[101:43.95]No, no, no, no, no, no.
[101:44.83]What?
[102:20.75]Maybe it'll remember us.
[102:21.65]Maybe it'll remember us.
[102:28.94]There's no save game.
[102:29.94]Maybe it might just remember who we are.
[102:31.92]You know what I mean?
[102:42.04]It could just remember that we were doing this.
[102:46.37]It's a Windows game, definitely not.
[102:47.95]You never know, because when I'm... During all that, like, cutting and shit... It's... I think it's just dumping shit into the C drive.
[102:56.59]Oh, fuck.
[103:07.07]No!
[103:08.46]No, it was going so well!
[103:10.84]It was going so well!
[103:13.34]At least we got to see it.
[103:15.60]Damn it!
[103:22.52]There was so much more to explore!
[103:27.60]Alright, I can skip that.
[103:39.67]Welcome.
[103:41.14]I've chosen you.
[103:43.28]Okay.
[103:49.58]Whoa.
[103:52.32]Yeah, I don't think there even is.
[103:53.51]I'm gonna laugh my ass off, please.
[103:56.55]If I- I would laugh my ass off if the poster's still here.
[104:04.73]Nooooooooooo.
[104:07.14]Nooooooo!
[104:10.74]We were so close to clicking on this.
[104:13.30]We were so close!
[104:21.83]I'm not giving up yet.
[104:22.77]No.
[104:38.04]It's not here.
[104:39.14]It's not here.
[104:39.82]Okay, now this is studio operations where you get started.
[104:44.82]Oh!
[104:46.91]Oh!
[104:47.49]Oh!
[104:51.91]It's here!
[104:53.00]Wait.
[104:54.66]I don't wanna ride over this.
[105:00.72]Hold on.
[105:02.10]Am I gonna ride over this?
[105:09.29]Like, just... That's the movie, right?
[105:13.03]Just hit okay.
[105:14.35]That's the movie, right?
[105:20.94]Don't, don't, don't, don't.
[105:22.20]Just go to the theater.
[105:31.19]Look up what it does.
[105:32.13]Guys, nobody's ever played this game before.
[105:38.25]I'm gonna go to the theater.
[105:54.71]Disk 3.
[105:55.95]I got it.
[105:56.55]Where's disk 2?
[105:57.35]I freaked out and dropped it.
[105:58.25]It's right here.
[106:15.41]I got a piss tube really bad.
[106:23.26]Alright, come on.
[106:24.00]Let us watch it.
[106:24.72]Let us get the... We've been here for like almost two hours.
[106:35.99]Admit won.
[106:36.71]What?
[106:39.12]This isn't my movie.
[107:02.00]Okay, all these... Where's your movie?
[107:08.50]Is this just the credits of the game?
[107:10.18]Imagine you went to watch a movie, and it was just the credits of the movie.
[107:25.69]Well that sucked.
[107:27.36]What a shitty movie.
[107:29.65]Oh my god.
[107:30.89]Alright, we have to try to load the other one.
[107:34.46]You know what I'm saying?
[107:38.02]Go back to the save.
[107:40.12]Hold on.
[107:40.44]I can't make decisions like this.
[107:41.58]I'm going to pee my pants.
[107:42.60]I can't make a decision with a piss building up inside me.
[107:56.30]Alright, give me a minute.
[107:57.06]I'll be right back.
[107:57.74]I'm literally going to piss my pants if I don't leave right now.
[108:02.47]I'll be right back.
[108:02.95]I'll be right back.
[110:07.16]Alright, let's go.
[110:13.52]Alright, we're gonna try to load that save.
[110:26.44]Is it American Dad music?
[110:31.16]Back up, back up the files, back up the files!
[110:36.22]I think this is... I'm here to assist you.
[110:40.31]What happened to it?
[110:45.05]Oh my god, you're gonna give me a fucking heart attack!
[110:55.16]There's okay and there's delete, guys.
[110:57.56]So, snapshot VM.
[110:59.50]I don't know how to do that.
[111:01.49]I have absolutely no fucking idea how to do that.
[111:14.20]Tested on an empty slot.
[111:17.01]Got it.
[111:24.03]Bingo.
[111:25.13]Bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo, bingo!
[111:28.97]There it is.
[111:30.79]Options.
[111:42.64]Export, import.
[111:43.92]No, this is fine.
[111:44.86]We're good.
[112:06.76]I'm just, we're just gonna watch it.
[112:09.91]We don't need to go to the fucking lab.
[112:12.73]Let's go.
[112:14.69]In the dryer.
[112:15.31]Yeah, who gives a shit?
[112:20.47]Fuck the lab.
[112:29.98]Oh.
[112:36.42]Oh, that's bullshit.
[112:42.16]Fucking disk two.
[112:54.67]Disk swap.
[113:01.26]Alright, I ain't gonna move.
[113:06.10]I'm not touching anything.
[113:10.46]I'm gonna let it just sit here for a second.
[113:12.13]I'm not touching anything.
[113:18.91]Nobody move.
[113:25.13]I have start and I have stop.
[113:27.79]Okay.
[113:29.92]Here we go.
[113:32.32]Start.
[113:32.66]Okay.
[113:37.66]Okay.
[113:41.38]Don't move.
[114:09.76]Now what?
[114:14.85]I don't think we can print them.
[114:18.80]I think they're unprintable.
[114:35.17]We're just gonna have to view the work print.
[114:37.17]That's all we can do.
[114:37.99]We know we're gonna have no sound effects.
[114:46.31]Damn it.
[114:50.21]Well, whatever.
[114:51.01]We can still do it.
[114:52.71]It's still alright.
[114:55.86]Export it.
[115:07.95]Actually sad.
[115:08.73]Well, that's unfortunate.
[115:09.67]But, you know, these are all a complete gamble.
[115:15.06]Every single one of these games that you're gonna see, that you have seen, is just throw dice in the air.
[115:19.46]Is it gonna work?
[115:20.32]Who fucking knows.
[115:28.60]I'm just really happy that we at least got to see this shit.
[115:40.45]I'm gonna try to export it.
[115:44.37]Welcome.
[115:50.15]Whoa, here we go.
[115:56.62]Don't scare me like this.
[115:57.66]Okay, so, Jeremy French Fry loaded up.
[116:05.92]Okay.
[116:09.36]I'm going to go to options and I'm going to go to export.
[116:14.24]Export to where?
[116:14.98]Hold on, let me just...
[116:19.50]Uh-oh.
[116:21.78]Uh, this is not.
[116:23.04]This is not doing what I think you guys think it's going to do.
[116:29.29]Uh, I did it.
[116:31.01]It's a .dat.
[116:32.79]Here, why is this not on?
[116:34.65]Look.
[116:36.55]Okay.
[116:40.07]That's what I just did.
[116:41.11]Export .dat.
[116:46.82]I don't know.
[116:47.40]Let's go.
[116:49.14]Let's just watch the movie while we have a minute.
[116:52.74]We just need to see it.
[117:00.03]It's a save file, not the movie.
[117:01.73]That's unfortunate.
[117:05.44]Will VLC play this?
[117:11.88]Oh well, let's go into the dryer.
[117:15.55]Let's view the work print.
[117:20.25]Gotta do what we gotta do.
[117:28.44]Load the .dat in Windows Media to view it.
[117:31.38]I highly, highly suspect if that's gonna work.
[117:43.37]At least give us this.
[117:44.35]Give us this.
[117:45.03]Let us at least see the damn thing.
[117:48.43]Even without music, it don't matter.
[117:49.79]Here we go.
[117:59.78]There's nobody in.
[118:00.66]Oh, right, because it's $5,000 a ticket.
[118:02.88]That makes sense.
[118:06.36]Nobody here.
[118:12.88]Mom?
[118:13.84]Well, I guess this is goodbye.
[118:51.32]Any last words?
[119:29.96]Impresses the studio with sharp director's cut.
[119:33.56]Ooh.
[119:44.77]Did it.
[119:48.61]Try the lab now.
[119:51.49]Alright, I'm gonna try the lab quick.
[119:54.33]I'm gonna do lab.
[119:55.31]Press button to start walking around.
[119:56.87]I'm not even gonna give it a second.
[119:57.77]Ready?
[119:57.93]Watch this.
[119:58.83]Here we go.
[119:59.27]One, two, three.
[120:01.05]Start it.
[120:02.23]It's going.
[120:02.85]Here's the thing.
[120:04.80]I'm fucking leaving now.
[120:06.00]Leave.
[120:07.70]Leave quick.
[120:08.32]Out, out, out.
[120:08.86]Leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave, leave.
[120:10.54]I can't.
[120:10.82]It's frozen.
[120:15.14]Stop it.
[120:17.80]Oh.
[120:19.42]I caught it right in the middle.
[120:22.66]What should I do?
[120:23.54]Should I say yes?
[120:25.00]I fucked it up.
[120:26.46]So now, should I say yes?
[120:33.02]Because right now, it's like, hold on, wait a minute.
[120:36.64]I caught it.
[120:41.31]Keep going.
[120:48.49]Stop it again?
[120:49.97]No, don't.
[120:51.01]I'm just trying to keep it from crashing.
[120:55.88]You know what I mean?
[120:56.36]Like, every, like, five to six... Fuck you.
[120:59.66]No, it's not gonna work.
[121:02.09]I thought I could, like, intervene and, like, make it think again.
[121:06.27]No.
[121:07.71]It's not gonna work.
[121:09.83]Oh, well.
[121:20.20]The dat is a media file.
[121:21.64]Open it and... Hold on.
[121:26.58]Wait a second.
[121:30.77]You're telling me that's a media file?
[121:32.95]Let me look.
[121:35.55]I'll laugh my fucking ass off if that's true.
[121:39.15]Alright, let's go into Director's Chair.
[121:46.07]Here's movie.dat.
[121:49.59]Okay, there it is.
[121:50.64]It's 63 kilobytes, guys.
[121:52.14]I don't think this is gonna work.
[122:08.06]Okay, I'm gonna open this with VLC Media Player.
[122:24.85]No, that ain't gonna work.
[122:26.87]That's not gonna work.
[122:31.24]Oh well.
[122:34.12]Oh well.
[122:38.77]Let's keep going.
[122:44.15]This next one we're going to put in is going to be very interesting.
[122:51.84]At least we got to see it.
[122:53.12]At least we got to play it.
[122:54.32]And I kind of want to do more of that.
[123:01.67]Put the dat file in your router config.
[123:04.11]Why would I fucking do that?
[123:06.39]The next one is called Piper, where you play as the Pied Piper.
[123:13.09]It is a children's game.
[123:15.84]Good luck.
[123:16.10]Just give me one sec while I move this around.
[123:28.96]Piper.
[123:37.70]I might have to move the viewing angle around a little bit.
[123:46.04]Let me get into here.
[123:49.71]Okay.
[123:50.89]Are you ready?
[123:56.23]Let's go.

[128:27.95]Well, I'm the Pied Piper.
[128:29.67]I heard you had a rat problem.
[128:32.29]Is that true?
[128:33.60]Well, yeah, we do kind of have a rat problem, but maybe... Yeah.
[128:39.10]Aye, the rats are in my stew, and they're making this shit in the pasta sauce.
[128:43.70]It's disgusting, I tell you.
[128:48.04]Yeah, and I'm scared of the rats, too, because rats are weird and furry.
[128:51.53]Me, too.
[128:52.11]Rats are furry.
[128:54.07]Hmm, then I guess I can help you all out here.

[131:45.62]Why the fuck do I have two minutes to do this?
[131:51.05]Give this one a try.
[132:12.84]It doesn't go here.
[132:14.70]Boy, this is harder than I thought.
[132:17.10]That's it, children.
[132:18.46]Now you're getting it.
[132:21.56]Don't give up.
[132:22.69]That piece has to go somewhere.

[132:26.83]You've got one.
[132:27.93]Don't stop now.

[134:14.59]Okay, I'm done.
[134:24.44]I'm not even paying attention.
[134:27.93]I'm reading chat.
[134:31.23]I'm literally clicking random places and looking at chat.
[134:39.99]Alright, now let's see what things are.
[134:41.23]63 up there.
[134:42.55]63, 71.
[134:42.81]63, 63.
[134:42.85]71, 71, and then over here.
[134:45.21]See, guys, will you fucking relax?
[134:53.37]I knew it.
[134:54.57]That does it.
[134:55.65]I've got them all.
[134:57.74]Huh?
[134:59.36]What in tarnation?
[135:01.46]That's Coco Pelly, the flute player.
[135:04.26]And he's pointing to the fireplace.
[135:15.20]I have an idea.
[135:22.52]This idea might work.
[135:24.40]Give me one second.
[135:27.86]I'm just going to queue up the cutscenes.
[135:29.94]If they're on YouTube.
[135:32.56]And just mute this and just play the cutscene.
[135:38.38]Thank you, TheTickles, for the five community subs.
[135:40.76]Thank you.
[135:42.76]Appreciate it.
[135:44.46]Is this shit on YouTube?
[135:47.24]I would be shocked if it was.
[135:56.29]Thank you for the five subs, though, for real.
[136:05.00]Um...
[136:15.77]Let me see if this works.
[136:16.71]Just give me one second.
[136:18.89]Chunky baloney, five community subs.
[136:20.35]Thanks, both of you guys.
[136:27.35]Okay.
[136:28.22]I think I got it.
[136:29.38]There's just like a whole cutscene here.
[136:31.60]I'm gonna try to queue this up.
[136:33.24]Episode one.
[136:35.36]Episode one.
[136:38.34]Alright, here we go.
[136:39.42]Ready?
[136:42.41]I gotta try to queue this up.
[136:43.47]It's muted.
[136:53.23]Yeah.
[136:53.87]Okay.
[137:00.82]Hold on.
[137:02.08]I have to go physically in here and do the mixer.
[137:07.20]I can't mute this because I'm going to mute everything.
[137:10.18]Alright.
[137:11.18]That should work.
[137:13.93]Alright.
[137:14.35]Here we go.
[137:15.47]And I fixed it!
[137:17.82]Three, two, one.
[137:31.79]Oh, come on.
[137:34.51]What the fuck?
[137:42.39]Oh, great.
[137:42.87]This is bad.
[137:43.41]I think... Oh, no.
[137:45.71]The whole thing's coming down.
[137:50.51]Here comes the first force quit of the night out of the virtual machine.
[137:53.81]Alright, well, that's it for that one.
[138:03.95]I have to force close this shit.
[138:08.35]Cannot carry out the commands.
[138:10.72]And apparently it's still paused.
[138:12.14]Give me a fucking break.
[138:17.39]Crunchy ass stuff.
[138:18.73]Alright, here we go.
[138:19.99]Coming back.
[138:24.07]This next one is called Paparazzi.
[138:29.06]You have to take pictures of celebrities, I guess.
[138:40.88]Well, whatever.
[138:41.36]I'm not going to put it back in ever again anyways.
[138:44.82]Alright, here we go.
[138:48.04]Now, this one hopefully works.
[138:51.44]It'd be sad if it didn't.
[138:54.10]It's the dice you roll during these streams, though.
[139:01.58]Alright, let's go.
[139:04.41]Open, open, close, close.
[139:12.27]Paparazzi.
[139:13.49]Incoming.

[139:21.46]Okay.
[139:22.88]Okay.
[139:26.71]Okay, what's going on here?
[139:30.65]What the fuck are you doing?
[139:32.15]Close the fucking thing.
[139:36.09]Is Jeremy crying?
[139:36.93]I'm trying not to fucking cry.
[139:47.25]It's loading.
[139:47.69]Hold on.
[139:54.26]And... Alright.
[140:05.05]Uh, why is there no audio?
[140:06.21]Oh, it's because I turned it off.
[140:07.49]Right.

[140:55.02]It worked before!
[140:56.04]Let me try and learn it again.
[141:08.92]Open!
[141:10.36]Go!
[141:16.00]Braco!
[141:21.26]Okay.
[141:23.42]Well there's another swing and a miss apparently.
[141:29.13]I'm gonna try one more thing.
[141:42.08]Did the Steven Spielberg game break the VM?
[141:45.34]I don't think so.
[141:55.91]Run the setup?
[141:56.55]I think I already did that.
[141:57.49]Hold on.
[141:57.99]Let me... I don't want you to see where my files are going.
[142:09.62]I already did this.
[143:02.87]Come on, do it!
[143:08.79]I can hear it.
[143:10.89]We're good?
[143:12.31]Are we?
[143:13.78]I have no idea how good we are.
[143:16.50]Uh, calls?

[143:24.28]You know how I've been covering that H. Allen Eagler guns for jellybean scandal?
[143:29.41]Well, I was just at our customs office in Florida and our investigation just uncovered an invoice
[143:35.63]for Iranian jelly beans shipped to Tinseltown.
[143:39.68]And I think there's some sort of deal going down tonight in one of those dark alleys, and none of our photographers are in town.
[143:46.02]Okay.
[143:46.40]Hey.
[143:47.36]I don't... If you get anything, our bureau chief says you can sell the photo to us.
[143:51.58]I have to take a picture of you selling jelly beans?
[143:54.41]Because we want to break the story first.
[143:57.21]Now, I gotta go.
[143:57.97]I got a plane to catch.
[143:59.33]Good luck.

[158:47.46]We're not mean people by nature.
[158:49.56]It's just a service.
[158:51.62]We're just giving all those male chauvinist pigs what they know they deserve.

[159:30.52]Let's see if we can get anything.
[159:33.74]Why do I want the details?

[159:35.74]I'm supposed to take pictures of the guy going into...
[159:40.67]See the... you know.
[159:42.33]I got him.
[159:46.71]Still, let's go back.
[159:47.43]Let's go to the court?
[159:48.61]Maybe there's somebody coming out of the courthouse.
[160:12.34]Yeah, I do realize that my character is an imbecile.
[160:16.47]Anybody?
[160:24.09]Why is this guy everywhere?
[160:38.77]Who is this guy?
[160:39.83]Why is he in ev- He's everywhere.
[160:42.09]He's in every scene.
[160:49.74]Mom.
[160:52.15]Remember me?
[160:53.69]This is a voice from your past, your mother.
[160:57.23]I want you to get on that phone and give me a call.
[161:00.15]I haven't heard from you in ages.
[161:02.81]I know you're busy hanging around with all those mucky muck stars, but I sure wish you'd get on the phone and call me.
[161:10.95]I love you.
[161:12.05]Bye.
[161:14.11]How does she send this to me?
[161:17.19]That's not accurate.
[161:18.80]Old people don't know how to use technology.
[161:23.46]I would have gotten a letter in the mail.
[161:30.81]You can.
[161:31.35]Yeah, I'm not that old.
[161:32.61]Let's go to the hotel.
[161:33.39]Alright, the guy in a different hat doing magic tricks.
[161:38.59]What do you think?
[161:47.71]Did I get him?
[161:49.13]Is there anybody in that car?
[161:50.39]This is the guy stalking me.
[161:52.22]Alright, then I'm gonna go to the blue thug?
[161:55.14]The blue bug?
[162:35.69]That's actually pretty good.
[162:40.10]Here we go.

[167:35.16]Okay, so...
[167:58.98]Alright, let's go back to the camera place.

[169:22.01]News One, the only one.
[169:35.44]Hi, I'm Rob Estesheen.
[169:39.12]You know, I used to think that life was just fun and games and that I was bulletproof.
[169:44.81]Well, maybe I am, but not everybody else is.
[169:47.17]Listen, don't drink and drive.
[169:48.69]If you go on a bender, you may lose more than a fender.

[171:08.06]Do it for Ed.
[171:09.28]Just call this number for a prayer request or yogurt order.
[171:13.36]Everything's a 900 number.
[171:14.04]And remember to Yodan it.
[171:18.88]Yeah, I'm just looking over these credit card receipts like you'd ask me to.
[171:21.89]It seems like our boy Fast Freddy isn't so fast after all.
[171:25.47]Let's see, he's got some charges at the hotel, and today he charged some gas and groceries and a fishing boat rental or something.
[171:34.66]Looks like he's spotless to me.
[171:38.65]Hotel?
[171:40.62]I was working at the gym just the other day, you know, just to stay svelte.
[171:44.22]And I saw Jackie Ray Gunn there.
[171:46.78]Anyway, I saw her in the dressing room and she was using a towel from the Aroma Motel.
[171:51.96]Maybe she's got a new presidential sweetheart.
[171:54.21]Motel.
[171:54.51]I just thought you might be interested.
[171:56.41]Motel, motel.
[171:57.17]We're going to get an affair here.
[172:06.25]Here it comes.
[172:10.37]Hey, is this your battery?
[172:12.99]I think it's still good.
[172:46.33]Let's get it.
[172:47.01]Come on.
[172:47.43]I need some money.
[172:50.17]I gotta start making cash somewhere.
[172:53.45]No, what the fuck?
[172:54.63]Where?
[172:55.01]Hey there.
[172:55.37]Now I just want to give you a little tip.
[173:12.20]If you happen to sell one of your photos to one of the less reputable publications, well, who knows what they're going to use it for.
[173:19.38]Because sometimes they even accept your photos with an out-and-out lie for the caption.
[173:25.74]Okay, guide.
[173:27.88]The... Uh, there's a lot of fucking people.
[173:32.28]I am the alien.
[173:35.15]Your stupidity makes me ill and angry.
[173:40.55]Okay.
[173:41.71]Andre McConaugh, tennis star.
[173:43.56]But you probably already know this.
[173:48.20]Barry Begonia's the name.
[173:50.60]Frisbee golf.
[173:52.24]The game.
[173:55.96]There's a lot of fucking people in this game.
[173:57.69]Hi, the name's Cheevers.
[173:59.53]The man to see for photography.
[174:04.45]I'm Okra.
[174:05.69]You're Okra.
[174:07.75]I'm every Okra.
[174:10.84]Okay.
[174:11.64]What?
[174:12.24]Home is what?
[174:12.96]Say that again?
[174:37.49]410 plus 3 and plus one more.
[174:41.85]Home is 310 plus 4.
[174:44.50]310 plus 4?
[174:54.00]I'm Flash Rockman, and I'm here to tell you about the Clogs for Tots program.
[174:59.50]Every day, there are children all over the world who can't afford decent shoes.
[175:05.60]Clogs for Tots helps these less fortunate little ones get the shoes they need.
[175:10.58]So if you love children like I do, you'll give generously.
[175:14.98]Before my Clogs for Tots...
[175:23.29]Go to the motel now, because it's nighttime?
[175:25.43]I'll try it.
[175:28.17]I am here because you, the people of America, understand exactly what is wrong with this country.
[175:35.08]Now, for you small-minded people who don't understand exactly what I'm talking about, let me explain it logically.
[175:42.92]It's these feminazis who are taking over the country.
[175:46.75]Billory and all of her friends are out there meddling in the government when they should be holding Tupperware parties and such.
[175:52.77]Hey, we didn't vote for her.
[175:54.45]It's all the same, you see.
[175:56.43]These feminazis think that they can whip us all into shape and tie us up and have their way with us and make us kiss their feet and put us in handcuffs and... I can't stand it anymore!
[176:08.80]Let me tell you, Joe, the aliens too.
[176:10.52]Look at all these people trying to come up with a process.
[176:16.14]And the thing is, it's really...
[176:24.63]today on a steamy affair princess griselda she's going to get the last laugh on the prince she's independent wild and finally free of the old boar just because I was wed into a royal family does not mean that they own me you see I love my mother-in-law the queen as much as she's just going to have to realize that I am my own woman now royal family or no
[176:52.47]Alright.
[176:52.99]So it's night time.
[176:53.43]I'm gonna try the motel again.
[176:56.27]Come on.
[176:56.65]Get us something here.
[176:58.45]Bingo.
[177:25.56]I need a good shot of his face.
[177:26.50]Fuck!
[177:26.96]Did I get one?
[177:29.28]No!
[177:29.76]No!
[177:30.58]I didn't get... No!
[177:31.78]I just got a picture of his face.
[177:57.24]Damn it, I missed it!
[178:06.55]No!
[178:09.65]Oh, shit!
[178:13.91]I just got his face, fuck!
[178:22.85]That's not good.
[178:24.76]That's not good.
[178:27.04]Can I go back?
[178:27.56]What if I go back?
[178:42.41]What?
[178:42.73]Intro screen.
[178:47.73]Let's go.
[178:48.01]What the fuck is going on?
[179:05.32]I can't believe I missed it.
[179:06.88]I thought we just had to get him go.
[179:08.26]I didn't know that was going to be a whole part two there.
[179:10.92]Where he... God damn it.
[179:30.10]I can't... Ten...
[179:33.82]We take you now to a live press conference.
[179:35.92]Liz Naylor and Flash Rockman get together to announce their new cologne, Soul to Soul.
[179:41.23]We've come together to make a special announcement.
[179:44.69]It's a brand-new kind of cologne.
[179:47.39]The first of its kind.
[179:48.97]For both sexes, it's pure attraction.
[179:51.53]Hee-hee-hee!
[179:53.26]We're calling it Soul to Soul.
[179:56.74]There's a real drop of fish oil in every bottle.
[179:59.90]Ow!
[180:01.52]We got George Spielman to direct the commercial.
[180:05.74]We now return you to your regularly scheduled program.
[180:11.36]I could do a better one than that.
[180:19.16]A match made in music heaven ended this week when Sharon Sherlike broke off her engagement with X-Minuto star Jesus de la Tortilla.
[180:28.20]Sherlike said, and I quote, people used to line up for miles to see him, but now he is just too old and set in his ways.
[180:35.33]I just need more spunk.
[180:37.83]Hmm.
[180:38.89]More spunk.
[180:40.99]What the fuck?
[180:44.52]Don't do that.
[180:45.74]What are you doing?
[180:47.21]As you can see here, Bob is lubricating the master screw.
[180:50.20]As you can see here...
[180:59.66]We're talking today with women who only have one love in their life.
[181:05.40]It's chocolate.
[181:07.38]And one of them might surprise you.
[181:09.85]It's supermodel Candy Inez Baker.
[181:13.59]So, let me get this straight, Inez.
[181:17.01]You like chocolate.
[181:20.02]Oh, yes, I love it.
[181:21.88]Chocolate kisses, chocolate truffles, especially chocolate ice cream.
[181:27.33]I'm a hog applauding Pete's chocolate explosion.
[181:30.77]I have to have it every night.
[181:33.19]Is it like a bakery or something?
[181:35.03]Did you hear this, ladies?
[181:36.92]She's got to be kidding.
[181:38.70]You don't look like this on a diet of chocolate ice cream.
[181:43.30]How do you do it?
[181:46.34]I just have a high metabolism and a good workout plan.
[181:49.18]Nothing fancy.
[181:52.20]Doesn't she make you sick?
[181:55.00]We'll be right back.
[182:04.93]Didn't we already see the underwear one?
[182:06.17]She just finished her latest work, My Many Past Lives, all as first wives.
[182:13.36]Please welcome former first lady and reincarnation expert, Jackie Ray Dunn.
[182:18.70]Reincarnation expert.
[182:20.52]Well, Wanda, I'm hardly an expert, but when you've had as many lives as I have, well, you can learn a lot.
[182:29.64]I'll bet you can.

[211:55.23]No, it's this guy again.
[212:04.85]Why should it be somebody in the background there?
[212:13.89]Alright, I got another chance here.
[212:15.73]Should I go back to the camera place, see if I can get the alien again?
[212:27.86]I wonder if that'll happen again.
[212:30.80]You gotta get it right when he's coming out the door and then run.
[212:36.12]I haven't even been to the mall.
[212:38.08]Let's try it.
[213:00.03]This is it.
[213:01.61]Okay, here we go, here we go.

[213:28.95]Sell it to the FBI for five thousand dollars.
[213:31.17]Yup.
[213:36.96]You have photographed classified information.
[213:39.80]The fine for that is five thousand dollars.

[215:58.92]Ah.
[216:05.10]Ah, alright.
[216:10.65]Good to go.
[216:12.19]And what happened to you?
[216:14.65]You know, I used to tell myself, sure, you're a paparazzi, but you're basically a nice person.
[216:21.07]And as it turns out, you're just another lowlife like all the rest of them.
[216:26.76]Did I have to put this into loose?
[216:34.52]Darlings, I don't know about you, but I just love my little foo-foo.
[216:48.78]I don't want to see it.
[216:50.10]We've seen it already like three times.
[216:52.44]Today in sports, the National Union of Ball Inflators and Makers went on strike.
[216:57.38]So now the sports industry truly has no balls.
[217:01.85]And if there were any balls, they'd be deflated anyway.
[217:06.09]The union is demanding the firstborn son of all sports fans before play can resume.
[217:11.41]What?
[217:12.82]So that's your sports for today.
[217:14.86]See you next time.
[217:15.58]What the fuck are you talking about?
[217:21.50]Baby Channel.
[217:24.32]Wanda.
[217:25.02]What's this game called?
[217:26.20]It's called Paparazzi Tales from Tinseltown.
[217:36.56]She's the Virgin Mary.
[217:39.25]And like her or not, she's here to sell her new book.
[217:43.41]I can't say the title.
[217:45.48]I'll just call it Fred.
[217:47.90]What's the matter, Wanda?
[217:49.62]You afraid to say f***?
[217:52.33]No, I just think Fred is safer.
[217:55.63]Safe?
[217:57.49]Life isn't safe, baby.
[217:59.77]You've got to run with the bitches if you want to be a big dog, honey.
[218:04.61]Let's just talk about the book.
[218:08.28]The book is about sex, of course.
[218:11.78]Are you afraid of sex, Wanda?
[218:14.82]You don't have to be.
[218:16.98]Look at this picture, Wanda.
[218:20.56]What does it remind you of?
[218:23.79]Don't turn that over here.
[218:24.69]Is this a porn game?
[218:25.29]No.
[218:25.41]I promise.
[218:26.23]Skip.
[218:26.47]Alright, so we don't have any leads or anything.
[218:51.76]You know, I used to tell myself, sure, you're a pop.
[218:54.60]We don't got any leads.
[218:55.44]Where should we go?
[218:56.26]The mall?
[219:02.36]Grand Hotel?
[219:03.44]Go to the park?
[219:05.28]Camera store?
[219:06.84]Hmm.
[219:07.54]Let's try the park.
[219:17.16]Because it is technically Sunday.
[219:23.28]It's gonna be clowns, like, juggling or something, right?
[219:35.11]What was that?
[219:37.98]Watch out for the dog
[220:19.74]Let's go to the fog
[220:41.04]Always too early.
[220:41.82]Well, I don't know what I'm supposed to be looking at.

[221:16.85]Go back to the FUG.
[221:38.18]Really?
[221:39.90]Why do you guys want me to go back to the phone?

[223:32.44]Punching someone.
[223:34.02]From beating somebody up.
[223:52.94]There's no lyrics.
[223:54.09]That's astounding.
[224:05.73]Do you have any idea why my shampoo is so good for your hair?
[224:08.54]No.
[224:09.96]Why?
[224:10.90]It's a secret ingredient.
[224:13.17]What is it?
[224:14.28]Well, it's red and it looks like celery.
[224:16.28]No, no, it can't be.

[239:51.67]Holy shit, who is this?
[239:53.51]And why are they worth $14,000?
[239:54.27]Other people.
[239:55.19]Should I get some integrity?
[240:12.34]I need integrity.
[240:16.68]Don't ruin my integrity.
[240:18.02]Okay, well, this STY is integrity, right?
[240:24.42]Uh-oh.
[240:25.34]Integrity equals more story.
[240:28.40]I'm too... I don't have enough money.
[240:29.75]I'm alright.
[240:30.49]This will put me at about 10 grand.
[240:32.93]Integrity later.
[240:34.19]Big money.
[240:34.61]Big money.
[240:39.59]Off her diet.
[240:43.92]Alright.
[240:44.48]We're at night time.
[240:46.06]Tuesday.
[240:46.48]What was supposed to happen here?
[240:49.08]Landlord.
[240:52.11]What?
[240:52.25]What did he say?
[240:53.78]You have to pay me my money?
[240:59.70]How do I pay him?
[241:00.42]I got money.
[241:02.78]This is News 1.
[241:23.81]One big star has been brought down a notch today.
[241:26.33]Lassa Apso, former star of the TV series Green Junction, was arrested for assaulting a police officer with a piece of dog dung.
[241:34.65]The officer reported that he was simply trying to get Apso to clean up after her dog when she became upset and threw the offending offal at the officer.
[241:43.43]Lasso was sentenced to serve 200 hours of community service for the city, cleaning up poop in Tinseltown Park.
[241:50.41]And that's a scoop to me.
[241:51.59]Thanks for watching News 1.
[241:53.90]And remember, don't miss this one.
[242:03.22]It actually knows.
[242:06.05]In today's sports, absolutely nothing happened.
[242:10.07]I've been in this business for 12 years now, and this is definitely the first time this has happened.
[242:19.49]That's all.
[242:21.35]There was no baseball games, no tennis, not even a curling match.
[242:26.09]Nothing.
[242:26.55]Nobody is playing anything anywhere today.
[242:34.53]What else is there to say?
[242:36.73]Nothing.
[242:42.87]That's awesome.
[242:51.38]For great taste and true spirit.
[242:54.18]Alright, so what do we got?
[242:54.98]Tuesday night.
[242:56.20]We're going to the fog.
[243:05.34]We're meeting up with this new contact.
[243:07.32]I don't know who it is.
[243:12.82]I'm so glad you came.
[243:15.16]I'm sorry I haven't talked to you for four years, but Otto was very jealous.
[243:19.04]Otto?
[243:19.14]He doesn't like it when I spend a lot of time with my friends.
[243:25.79]He was so... unpredictable.
[243:32.37]It's so hard for me.
[243:36.04]But finally, I got enough courage to move out.
[243:42.66]And I found someone else.
[243:44.57]But it doesn't work out, but it's okay because we're just keeping everything hush-hush anyway.
[243:53.53]By the way, did I tell you I was staying at the Grand Cabernet?
[243:58.28]Yeah, okay.
[243:59.10]So what about it?
[243:59.64]So are you going?
[244:03.12]Hotel?
[244:03.28]Anybody want this?
[244:05.18]Go to the hotel?
[244:06.24]Hotel?
[244:06.62]Grand Hotel.
[244:06.98]Let's go?
[244:07.20]Should we try?
[244:31.89]What am I doing, though?
[244:32.67]What am I doing this for?
[244:33.95]Is this a side story?
[244:37.61]Okay, so now we have to go...
[245:01.70]To the mall.
[245:02.14]Who cares.
[245:03.01]Alright, it's time for the mall.
[245:03.75]We have to get a picture of that TV show.
[245:05.77]Let's go.
[245:32.02]What am I looking for, though?
[245:33.02]I don't know what I'm looking for.
[245:38.76]A men mishap.
[245:41.24]Just a photo.
[245:42.02]A good picture.
[245:42.72]I'm just going to get one to make sure.
[245:58.40]And we have an Amish expert here who has an answer to the problem.
[246:03.63]Thank you all for having me on your show today.
[246:06.41]Yes.
[246:06.67]I would just like to say that you don't need such material things to exist.
[246:11.79]You really need the basics.
[246:13.76]Food, shelter, clothing.
[246:16.96]You don't need such luxuries as fancy dresses or perfumes or phonographs or television sets.
[246:25.17]Wait a minute!
[246:26.13]Wait, hold on.
[246:27.03]You don't like TV or something, huh, Mr. Pilgrim?
[246:29.95]When?
[246:30.69]With this outfit.
[246:31.93]Punch?
[246:32.47]You know what you need?
[246:33.95]A shave.
[246:35.73]You think you're better than everyone else?
[246:37.53]That TV's too good for you?
[246:39.39]No.
[246:39.77]What is a good thing if people don't like TV?
[246:42.70]Because you sure look a fool now, you comedy.
[246:47.40]Oh shit!
[246:48.14]Did I get it?
[246:48.81]Look at the- That was mid stride.
[247:07.82]Full stride.
[247:10.38]That's gotta be worth something, right?
[247:16.28]Oh yeah.
[247:20.98]Knock the hat off.
[247:21.92]Alright, let's get some integrity.
[247:29.99]Vanities for some reputation.
[247:38.93]Or should I just don't even sell it and just keep my integrity?
[247:44.37]I do have a lot of money already.
[247:46.75]Entertainer the Tinseltown Tattler sounds like I think it's the more expensive the prices The less integrity We don't know that I mean I'm just taking a guess The Tattler
[248:16.76]Wait, it says it, what does it say?
[248:20.66]Integrity, sneaky.
[248:22.60]Oh, so the... That's definitely right.
[248:27.21]I'm selling all the vanities.
[248:32.39]OSR beats SJR and OW in RTG's... It's all still sneaky.
[248:41.88]It's alright.
[248:43.88]Alright, should I check the hotel again?
[248:46.74]She says you're staying there.
[248:47.60]Pay rent?
[248:49.72]I don't know how to pay my rent.
[249:11.93]Yeah, I was just at the Grand Habernet where I was supposed to be covering Rob Estesheen's speech at a drunk driving seminar.
[249:18.43]I was just there.
[249:19.27]Well, the problem is he wasn't there and no one seems to know where he was.
[249:23.86]Well, I guess he was just partying it up somewhere.
[249:29.88]You're watching the Fireplace Channel.
[249:35.50]I don't want to see that one again.
[249:39.04]We've seen it all.
[249:41.97]The ice cream.
[249:42.93]Alright, we've done it all.
[249:46.41]Alright, so then that, we're talking about the Rosies?
[249:56.18]The club, Rosies?
[249:57.29]The blue thug?
[250:09.93]you
[250:23.14]Anything else?
[250:23.70]That's it?
[250:57.27]Alright, well then, let's try the motel?
[251:02.33]The club?
[251:08.96]Rosie?
[251:09.30]See, it's going to be one of the... It's probably the Rosie's.
[251:11.26]It's probably Rosie's.
[251:12.46]Rosie's.
[251:12.92]It's one, two, or three.
[251:13.84]I'm going to try Rosie's.
[251:39.98]So we're at the club?
[251:42.29]No, it's another day.
[251:43.49]We missed it.
[251:46.57]It's another one of these.
[251:47.29]1-0, 1-0, 1-0.
[251:49.09]This is News 1.
[252:02.50]Talk show host and billionaire Okra Salad Raffle had just become a little less wealthy today as she was convicted of assault upon an Amish guest of the show.
[252:12.65]Eli Brown, the Amish plaintiff, won the case based on photographic evidence gained by a local photographer.
[252:19.53]The photo shows Okra bashing Mr. Brown over the head.
[252:23.49]The plaintiff was compensated for home remedy pills plus punitive damages of two oxen, a new cart, and a bony big screen TV.
[252:32.34]Those big TVs are great for pornos.
[252:36.02]You amaze me, Chip.
[252:37.28]It's just my job.
[252:39.57]I'm Flash Rockman, and I'm here to tell you about the claws for tops.
[252:44.95]Why would you say that?
[252:47.17]Doesn't make any sense.
[252:49.93]TV's funniest family bloopers and blunders and bleepers.
[252:55.03]The winner.
[252:55.88]The two disappeared without a trace.
[253:00.74]Ah.
[253:03.66]These are actual bloopers in the game.
[253:04.94]It's their own outtakes.
[253:06.16]That's funny.
[253:06.50]That's clever.
[253:31.93]That's clever.
[253:32.43]I like that.
[253:32.91]Alright, so let's do... I'm going to say we should go to the... I don't have any leads right now, though.
[253:48.28]Nothing's going on yet.
[253:54.96]Back to the club.
[253:55.56]Club?
[253:55.88]I'm going to say... What camera place?
[254:00.49]Back to the motel.
[254:03.12]I'm gonna go to the hotel.
[254:06.22]Yeah, I'm gonna try the hotel.
[254:14.24]If I get skip again, I'm never coming back here during the day.
[254:16.64]Yeah.
[254:20.63]I'm not going to the hotel again during the day.
[254:25.59]How about just the park?
[254:26.83]Let's try the park.
[254:38.57]Something going on in the park every day.
[254:39.79]Ducks.
[254:41.79]Let's go to the motel.
[254:42.89]That was fucking horrible, but I loved it.
[255:15.99]No, there he is again.

[255:36.89]What do you mean?
[255:37.59]He just bought some what?
[255:40.57]Oh, no!
[255:41.31]Oh!
[255:43.43]I know that you're just a sleazy jerk and a paparazzi, but you're the only one who can help me.
[255:49.60]I found this note in my mailbox this afternoon.
[255:53.68]It says, I've had just about enough.
[255:56.84]Everybody thinks I'm so tough.
[255:59.24]Going to go where nobody can find me, by the dumpster, going to leave it all behind me.
[256:05.12]That's it.
[256:05.80]There's no signature or anything.
[256:08.53]Just a little stain of frothy vomit.
[256:12.31]But I think it's true.
[256:13.71]Somebody's really gonna kill themselves.
[256:16.41]It's just awful.
[256:21.25]Who is this person?
[256:22.33]In the alley?

[259:56.56]Alright, we've got some Club Lingo, the Rosie, and Habernet.
[260:01.58]But it is a lie with a sound of one station under God.
[260:09.96]The music world mourns the loss of one of rock's greatest screamers, Axl Grease.
[260:15.20]He died somehow.
[260:17.15]We asked the rest of Sucking Chest Wound if there is life after Axl, and here's what they had to say.
[260:22.27]So guys, what are you going to do now that your singer-songwriter is gone?
[260:26.19]She's gonna do it.
[260:29.00]She's gonna do it.

[264:48.48]There's something we gotta talk about.
[264:49.96]Okay.
[264:51.22]Alright, let's go.
[264:51.90]Let's do that.
[264:54.89]Where the hell do I want to go first?
[264:55.97]I've got two choices here.
[264:57.03]Go back to the hotel?
[264:58.89]Grand Hotel.
[265:01.83]We have to have at least one... I'll go to the FUG right now.
[265:05.99]Just to make sure.
[265:10.64]I'll still have time to go to the hotel after this.
[265:20.26]I know it's strange for me to be here like this.
[265:23.55]but I had to tell you in person.
[265:26.51]Frankly, I don't think you have what it takes to make it around here.
[265:30.24]What?
[265:31.08]I hope you don't take this advice the wrong way, but when you don't make money, I don't make money.
[265:35.37]I have 20 grand.
[265:36.45]Isn't there something else you can make a living at?
[265:38.71]Love ya.
[266:00.23]I lost.
[266:00.63]How do you... I'm going again.
[266:03.21]Yeah, we gotta do this again.
[266:31.28]Hey.
[266:43.30]Hey.
[266:45.34]Uh, yeah, I still... How we're gonna end this stream tonight is we're gonna... I have, like, six more games.
[266:56.91]I want to play... I don't know.
[266:58.79]I got a lot.
[266:59.45]Hold on.
[266:59.69]I got one, two, three, four, five, six.
[267:02.60]I have like seven games, I think, still.
[267:06.34]And some of them are going to be really, really fucking good.
[267:08.10]So I... When you get a good one, I want you to stay on it.
[267:12.38]This is a good one.
[267:16.33]Do Space Ace now.
[267:17.27]I already did it.
[267:17.69]I'm just going to mute this because it's probably horrible to listen to.
[267:36.89]Alright.
[267:38.23]So, we start off here.
[267:40.01]Although, is it different?
[267:41.63]Hey, I got a tip for you that I thought you might want to hear, and there's not much time.
[267:46.08]You know how I've been covering that H. Allen Eagler of guns for jelly bean scandal?
[267:50.28]Right, we're going to get the... Well, it was just at our customs office in Florida.
[267:54.06]And our investigation just uncovered an invoice for Iranian jelly beans shipped to Tinseltown.
[268:01.51]And I think there's some sort of deal going down tonight in one of those dark alleys.
[268:04.53]And none of our photographers are in town.
[268:07.35]Allie, right?
[268:08.47]No, I don't have any assignments for you yet, but don't worry, I'm looking out for you, alright?
[268:12.61]So just hang in there.
[268:14.23]Here we go.
[268:15.75]This is the first one we take the picture, we gotta get the deal.
[268:17.91]So right when the- it's gonna- it's like guns or something, right?
[268:23.33]Or is it- what's in there?
[268:24.20]Drugs?
[268:39.16]Because that's a briefcase.
[268:41.90]You gotta get it when they... I'm gonna wait.
[268:47.42]Wait till they, like, take it out.
[268:48.36]I got one.
[268:51.80]Is there a better one?
[268:52.40]I mean, that's clearly, like, that's a gun.
[268:54.94]You know what I mean?
[268:55.52]Like, that's clear.
[268:56.56]I got it.
[269:08.67]Which one?
[269:09.59]The one pointed in the air, right?
[269:16.31]Sunglasses at night.
[269:17.41]I think it's the right one.
[269:21.04]The left one?
[269:21.56]Yeah, not bad.
[269:24.88]Alright.
[269:25.94]My integrity.
[269:26.64]I have to keep it good.
[269:27.96]But I also have to make money.
[269:30.04]What should I do with this?
[269:36.01]Just give it to the FBI.
[269:40.49]Or should I just do... I'm thinking about this one here.
[269:48.25]$2,000.
[269:48.53]No.
[269:51.67]Give me money.
[269:53.21]I need money right off the bat.
[269:55.99]The Jelly Cellar.
[269:58.13]Still friendly.
[270:03.54]Rob Estesheen.
[270:04.34]We've seen these already.
[270:09.31]Let's pay attention here.
[270:10.07]But where?
[270:10.79]Seen this already.
[270:12.59]Yeah, we've seen these.
[270:13.55]I think now we just have to kind of look around.
[270:15.47]Let's go to the camera place.
[270:38.33]Or, you know what?
[270:38.77]No, let's go, um... Country Club.
[270:45.86]Oh no, we've seen all the videos.
[270:49.38]That's why we can speedrun back to where we were.
[270:55.66]Alright.
[270:57.96]Oh, you... Oh.
[270:59.08]I wonder what the poor people are doing.
[271:09.38]I want to thank you for turning me on to that chief's cameras.
[271:13.33]I thought it was going to be some hole in the ball place, but I found the lens I was looking for.
[271:18.07]And that chief's fellow, he told me where I could get Sean Pendleton.
[271:21.95]I want to thank you.
[271:23.13]You are making me a very rich man.
[271:25.13]Alright.
[271:26.91]Okay.
[271:28.22]Camera store.
[271:30.96]And then he gives us a lead, right?
[271:42.32]How's a Nikon camera working out for you?
[271:45.16]Need some new filters?
[271:46.72]Well, you'll want one of these for sunset shooting.
[271:49.64]Hey, some guys came in here a little while ago and bought a bunch of lenses and lights and stuff.
[271:54.37]Said they were doing a shoot for a shoe commercial or something.
[271:57.85]And they put it all on that big shot producer George Spielman's account.
[272:01.78]Big spenders, huh?
[272:03.22]Where?
[272:03.76]Hey, I'll be seeing you.
[272:08.62]Okay, so where is that?
[272:12.05]Where would they be filming that, at the mall?
[272:18.02]Mall or the park?
[272:21.53]Yeah, that would be like a store at the mall.
[272:43.54]Country Club?
[272:44.56]It's fucking nighttime.
[272:45.94]Shit.
[272:46.48]It's too late now.
[273:12.92]Shit.
[273:14.18]Oh well.
[273:19.13]Head down the alley.
[273:21.93]I'll try the alley, why not.
[273:27.33]It probably was the country club.
[273:28.59]Because he'd be playing tennis.
[273:40.23]No, not getting mugged.
[273:45.12]Where should I go?
[273:47.26]To the blue fog?
[273:47.84]Go to the park at night?
[273:52.46]Or should I go to the blue fog?
[273:53.32]I'm probably going to go to the fog.
[273:59.58]Grab a picture of the alien.
[274:07.41]That doesn't happen yet, does it?
[274:09.81]Let me tell you, your hair smells magnifique.
[274:12.93]You know, it reminds me of...
[274:15.58]the gardens at Elizabeth Naylor's house.
[274:18.72]You know, one summer afternoon I was visiting ladies and I was taking a shot of her working in the garden, you know, without wearing one spot of makeup.
[274:27.74]Her nails and her hands were dirty filthy.
[274:30.20]She still looks so ravishingly beautiful.
[274:32.82]Oh, don't forgive me.
[274:35.88]I've taken this moment to reminisce.
[274:38.20]I hope I did not bore you.
[274:42.27]What are we supposed to do with that information?
[274:52.56]Bye, Mom.
[274:53.32]This is News 1.
[274:59.12]Rob Estesheen is in town to shoot a new movie, so we've got him live via remote from the set.
[275:04.02]Wait, this is new.
[275:05.64]Rob, could you tell us about your drunk driving charges?
[275:09.00]Has the little girl recovered from her coma yet?
[275:11.52]Well, dear, I think that everyone involved in this unfortunate incident has learned a great deal.
[275:19.05]And I have personally tried to raise the awareness of this problem.
[275:24.63]And I assure you, a lot of good has come out of this.
[275:26.95]First of all, I've taken up dancing.
[275:29.26]And the chicks are just eating that up.
[275:31.36]Secondly, I got a new movie out.
[275:33.30]And I think people are going to eat that up, too.
[275:35.82]How did you get out of all the charges?
[275:39.48]I think you're going to need to speak to my attorney.
[275:42.04]This interview's over.
[275:46.47]Thanks, Rob.
[275:48.90]What a great humanitarian, huh?
[275:51.64]News one.

[277:22.13]God damn it.
[277:33.10]He's gonna be sent to the hospital because he did that.
[277:35.24]God damn, it's ducks again.
[277:39.88]I'm gonna get it before he ducks.
[277:42.38]Damn it.
[277:54.55]What do you got?
[277:55.33]You won't believe this.
[277:56.71]In the middle of a shoot for a Wheaties commercial, Katie Johnson supposedly jumped in the back of a motorcycle.
[278:02.48]A motorcycle!
[278:03.48]And was never seen again.
[278:04.66]The production company's looking for her.
[278:06.58]I want you to get there first.
[278:08.78]I don't... Love ya!
[278:09.68]Love your work.
[278:10.48]But what?

[281:56.27]Did you go to the gym?
[281:57.57]Anyway, I saw her in the dressing room, and she was using a towel from the Aroma Motel.
[282:02.73]Maybe she's got a new presidential sweetheart.
[282:05.26]Just thought you might be interested.
[282:06.54]Okay.
[282:08.60]So that... Country Club?
[282:13.59]Well, the gym...

[285:43.53]If you happen to sell one of your photos to one of the less reputable publications, well, who knows what they're going to use it for.
[285:49.69]Because sometimes they even put up your photos with an out-and-out lie.
[285:54.29]I know.
[285:54.65]I said this wasn't a porn game.
[285:55.85]It's not a porn game.

[290:32.28]Remember me?
[290:34.20]Look, I understand if you don't want to talk to me right now.
[290:39.14]Maybe you could give me a chance to be on your side, huh?
[290:42.62]Look, I'm in jail.
[290:44.24]I'm fragile.
[290:46.79]If you could just find the money to bail me out just this once, I will make it worth your while.
[290:53.51]And I promise this one is a real cash cow.
[290:57.07]So what do you say?
[290:58.87]Want to bail me out?
[291:01.02]Yes.
[291:03.80]Please, it's just $2,000, huh?
[291:12.45]I got lots of money, I'm fine.
[291:13.49]We already got this though, right?
[291:16.34]Yeah, but when you bail him out of jail, he's around.

[291:49.77]Let's try to get that alien.
[291:51.09]Here it is.
[292:10.09]It's right when he walks out the door.
[292:24.26]Oh shit, they're both bad.
[292:26.46]This one's all blown out, this one.
[292:29.12]Okay.
[292:30.48]Do not send it to the FBI, they take money from you.
[292:35.03]National Geographic?
[292:48.06]The elusive... Rigel and Sufloid.
[292:52.56]What?
[292:53.94]Put this magazine in your closet.
[292:57.88]This is the Tinseltown Public Library.
[293:02.10]Our records show that someone has overdue materials at this number.
[293:06.12]This... That's my score.
[293:08.32]Alright.
[293:10.28]Still nighttime.
[293:12.12]I'm thinking...
[293:18.41]Back to the blue fog?
[293:19.19]Do the most dollars, you poop head.
[293:22.36]Glad to see you could make it.
[293:27.50]Uh, bartender, two rum and cokes, please.
[293:48.90]Well, there really hasn't been too much news lately.
[293:51.91]I mean, I live for natural disasters and fires and riots and things like that.
[293:57.89]I remember the great Boston molasses disaster of 1987.
[294:01.09]I mean, this big tank of molasses just explodes.
[294:06.91]It engulfs a four-block city radius, kills 48 people.
[294:11.22]I mean, you should have seen the look on those people's faces.
[294:14.58]I had to get out of the way, too.
[294:18.80]They say molasses is slow, but they've never seen a 14-foot wave of it either.
[294:25.24]Well, here's to your health.
[294:28.91]Nothing?
[294:29.25]You're not going to give me any info?
[294:39.43]There was nothing there.
[294:42.54]I am a nomad.
[294:44.02]Kings and Queens align with their burdened crowns on down for night.
[294:49.84]Thanks, Andy.
[294:57.51]Come to my big conference.
[295:03.55]Where?
[295:04.51]Where's this conference?
[295:06.47]He said this before and I couldn't find it.
[295:13.11]We've seen these already.
[295:16.81]My big conference.
[295:17.68]The country club?
[295:21.14]Hotel or country club?
[295:22.27]If a gym isn't the country club.
[295:26.11]Hey, I got something for you.
[295:28.93]It's a cannonball.
[295:59.62]Let's try the hotel.
[296:00.28]Not at the hotel, not at the gym.
[296:07.67]So where would your big conference be then?
[296:18.56]What the fuck?
[296:30.05]Hey, it looks like Rob Astorstein's finally gonna get his day in court.
[296:33.39]They're supposed to be shooting some drama about a tough ex-cop and a luscious district attorney.
[296:37.96]I remember I fucked this one up.
[296:39.38]So you'll probably see a lot of slunkies running around.
[296:41.74]Love ya, love your work.
[296:45.62]This is News 1.
[296:46.44]So I gotta take it when they're in the middle of kissing.
[296:51.53]We interrupt your regularly scheduled program for this special report.
[296:55.89]A flurry of eyewitness accounts have just poured in regarding strange lights appearing in the night sky over Tinseltown.
[297:01.49]Yeah, we already got that one.
[297:02.75]Alright.
[297:07.53]Skip.
[297:08.87]This is news.
[297:11.25]We just need to do the, get to the courthouse during the day, right?
[297:15.27]Or, is it right now?
[297:17.11]No, it's during the day.
[297:18.35]Tomorrow.
[297:21.39]Where do I want to go, then?
[297:22.15]Should I go to, like, this restaurant?
[297:31.60]Maybe I should go here.
[297:32.18]I don't think I've ever tried to go here at night.
[297:36.18]Ah, bonjourno, parlez-vous francais?
[298:03.13]The bait that they give you on these.
[298:04.71]Alright, we got one more shot here.
[298:16.79]Motel?
[298:20.75]Let's see if I can get something here.
[298:30.57]What am I going to take a photo of?
[298:37.77]What is this?
[298:48.35]What am I looking at?
[298:51.98]What the fuck is that?
[298:55.32]What's going on?
[298:58.08]So you're gonna get like sucked into a UFO?

[332:06.48]Because sometimes they even put up your photos with an out-and-out lie for the caption.
[332:18.00]I can't react.

[332:55.50]The Tinseltown Open is all set to go tomorrow, and it marks the return of the great one to professional frisbee golf.
[333:01.64]Yes, Barry Begonia is back in shape and back on the circuit.
[333:05.82]Yeah, I feel pretty good.
[333:08.28]The knee's all better and the thumbs are all thumbs up.
[333:12.67]My shot's a little rusty, but a hundred bucks still says I win this thing.
[333:19.13]You heard it.
[333:20.27]Take it to him, Barry.
[333:22.15]Next up, Curly.
[333:26.49]So that's tomorrow at either Country Club or... Alright.
[333:32.49]This is the show you've been waiting for.
[333:35.29]Me and Virgin Mary.
[333:40.18]We're going to talk about... Did you see her face?
[333:42.88]About condoms in school.
[333:44.20]She just was actually laughing at that.
[333:46.04]That was great.
[333:46.50]All the left-wing garbage she can think of.
[333:49.41]You're the only garbage I can think of right now.
[333:52.22]Oh, I see.
[333:52.70]We're going to have a real discussion, huh?
[333:55.40]Just like that real blonde hair.
[333:58.12]Hey, it's real, baby.
[334:00.72]I'm a natural blonde.
[334:02.24]You want to see how natural?
[334:05.77]Didn't I say this would happen?
[334:07.83]What about condoms in schools?
[334:09.19]What do you think about that?
[334:10.77]It's the 90s.
[334:11.79]Kids are going to have sex.
[334:13.59]They may as well be protected.
[334:16.11]Now, Mary, that is like giving away crash helmets to people so they can speed safely.
[334:21.58]Not f***ing exactly.
[334:23.34]Well, I don't think anyone needs condoms.
[334:25.80]I mean, only married people should have sex.
[334:29.08]So when it's my turn to vote at the courthouse, I'm going to vote no, just like Senator Frederick says.
[334:35.49]And I know some well-placed judges... Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[334:40.27]Courthouse tomorrow?
[334:41.61]You fat f***er!
[334:43.13]I've had it up to here.
[334:44.71]I'm going to prove the powers that be that we can do whatever we want, whenever we want.
[334:50.75]We march to victory, America!
[334:56.83]That was disgusting.
[335:00.38]Blondes.
[335:03.36]Don't touch, don't touch that.
[335:05.76]Skip.
[335:08.74]Alright, so we've got, tomorrow we've got the park or the country club and then the courthouse.
[335:16.52]But as for today, I have no idea.
[335:23.66]I'm gonna just maybe go to the... Just go to the country club today, too.
[335:35.49]Pay the rent?
[335:36.05]I don't even know how to do that.
[335:37.09]I think it just happens.
[335:43.29]Hey, I got something for you.
[335:45.29]It's a cannonball.
[336:02.71]I mean, it's kind of funny every time when he does that.
[336:04.89]But I'm sick of seeing it.
[336:08.07]We've seen it so many times.
[336:10.27]We've seen it like ten times.
[336:14.23]Hey there, buddy.
[336:16.49]How you doing?
[336:18.65]I think I've come down with something.
[336:20.79]Wanna buy some phlegm?
[336:23.28]Get it?
[336:24.00]Phlegm?
[336:26.72]Here you go.
[336:35.76]Alright, it's nighttime.
[336:37.94]Alright, we didn't do this one before.
[336:39.30]Okay, so he's not here, so where is he?
[336:41.02]We tried here, and we tried here, didn't we?
[337:08.27]Is this the only place that we didn't look before?
[337:10.39]Possibly.
[337:11.99]No cameras allowed.
[337:15.59]No cameras allowed.
[337:21.46]Give him $500.
[337:23.12]Yeah.
[337:46.39]Oh, shit.
[337:52.86]Oh, that's bad.
[337:53.56]Okay.
[338:03.88]Uh... How do we get... How do we get this... We gotta get this, like, on the fucking front page.
[338:17.64]The magazine that had the teenagers be like, yeah, I don't do this shit.
[338:20.45]I agree.
[338:25.21]Place?
[338:31.08]Place.
[338:38.51]Got it.
[338:47.23]Got it.
[338:47.63]Alright, so now we got tomorrow is the court and the country club or the park.
[338:52.55]I got one more thing to do tonight.
[338:58.35]Let's try...
[339:16.79]Try the hotel?
[339:19.31]Yeah, tomorrow there's two things that I know of, or that I remember.
[339:26.73]Court and country club, yeah.
[339:28.93]Should be easy tomorrow.
[339:31.35]What is this?
[339:32.03]What the fuck is going on?
[339:33.77]Oop.
[339:54.12]Did I get it?
[339:54.58]How many times after every picture did I go, did I get it?
[340:02.63]And then after you take a photo, did I get it?
[340:06.79]I don't know.
[340:08.09]Look at the camera, man.
[340:12.68]Which one of these do I want to do?
[340:13.82]Probably Harvey's Bazaar.
[340:20.74]Don't sell it.
[340:21.28]He's your friend.
[340:28.35]Andy Warthog, he's hip.
[340:29.97]He's dead, or is he?
[340:32.08]What do you mean he's dead?
[340:33.26]What are you talking about?
[340:43.98]His modem again.
[340:44.78]This is News 1.
[340:50.51]Talk show host Okra Salad Raffle testified before a grand jury today responding to allegations of assault on Eli Brown, an Amish guest on an untelevised show.
[341:02.23]The case was thrown out of court for lack of evidence on the part of the Amish plaintiff.
[341:07.33]Okra commented, Girl, this happens all the time.
[341:10.25]Y'all just jealous of how much I care?
[341:11.99]Mm-hmm.
[341:13.13]Speaking of care, I care for you, Smyrna.
[341:18.01]That's all for tonight.
[341:19.41]Good night.

[341:27.29]We get the mail channel every other day.
[341:30.07]I'd like anything else.
[341:30.97]You already saw those.
[341:34.06]Alright.
[341:34.88]Court.
[341:36.66]I need a picture of... I'm not sure what it is, but I know I need to go to the courthouse.
[341:56.36]No.
[342:00.94]Not where I needed to be.
[342:01.84]Alright.
[342:03.21]Uh... Country Club or Park.
[342:05.25]I don't know.
[342:06.69]Oh, this is right.
[342:28.49]This is it.
[342:28.89]Alright.
[342:31.15]Gotta be ready.
[342:31.97]What's he gonna do?
[342:32.85]What's he gonna do?
[342:59.10]I don't know where to take the picture.
[343:02.87]He's gonna hurt, he's gonna throw it back, it's gonna hit him in the face.
[343:04.85]I gotta be ready.
[343:06.33]Double or nothing!
[343:23.52]Triple!
[343:32.97]That one second is all you have.
[343:34.97]The money in the finger, money in the hand.
[343:49.24]Begonia battles the bent to bet.
[343:53.36]Sports betting.
[343:57.32]Hotel or motel?
[343:58.38]I know what that is.
[343:59.26]Hotel?
[343:59.50]Is it the hotel or the motel?
[344:27.09]Got it.
[344:31.42]Alright, now I'm gonna wait for something else to happen here.
[344:47.01]Something he's gonna... I think I... Something else?
[344:52.71]What now?
[344:57.59]Flee?
[344:57.93]Oh man, that's a lot of money.
[344:59.13]Nosy neighbor, $25,000.
[345:04.87]It's all good.
[345:05.29]A steamy affair.
[345:10.88]I like that one.
[345:30.58]Tinseltown is gonna be on TV tomorrow.
[345:41.33]Got that one, okay.
[345:43.57]Is it on TV yet?
[345:49.51]If you're just tuning in, we're following Barry Begonia's attempt to outrun authorities.
[345:54.92]He is suspected of gambling on a frisbee golf game after photographic evidence was revealed.
[346:04.18]What is this?
[346:08.48]Is this supposed to be them?
[346:10.30]Why is this?
[346:11.22]Why are we following a car driving around?
[346:18.00]If you're just tuning in, we're following Barry Begonia's attempt to outrun.
[346:22.30]Oh, attempt to outrun?
[346:25.14]I don't understand.
[346:27.14]It's on every channel.
[346:42.19]This is news.
[346:43.95]That's fucking funny.
[346:46.51]Alright, now... Go save Axel.
[346:52.72]You can't.
[346:53.48]I can't do anything.
[346:57.00]I can't.
[346:58.28]The outcome is the same every time.
[347:17.29]Don't flee.
[348:10.93]I'm not taking a photo of that.
[348:12.91]You have to stay.
[348:14.31]Hold on.
[348:26.18]I don't want to show this again.
[348:27.38]This is fucked up.
[348:30.28]This is fucked up.
[348:31.22]I'm not showing it again.
[348:34.70]This is fucked up.
[348:51.82]Hold on.
[348:54.16]Hold on.
[348:58.50]I think it's over.
[349:04.07]I think it's ending.
[349:32.78]I got to pay rent.
[349:33.52]No, I don't want to.
[349:34.92]That's too much for me.
[349:35.84]I don't want to show that shit.
[349:38.00]Alright, where we going?
[350:07.46]This is News 1.

[350:36.02]This is exactly where we were last time.
[350:38.91]Just tighten the valve cover.
[350:40.65]That's all you have to do.
[351:02.80]Yes, for your condoms in school.

[352:34.53]This is News 1.
[352:48.42]And now, here's Smyrna with the local band guide.
[352:51.80]Yeah, we already done this.
[352:53.02]Alright, let's go.
[352:54.58]Let's go to the motel.
[353:00.35]This is Jeff Bezos here.
[353:01.49]I'm here to inform you that you're in violation.
[353:04.14]It's alright.
[353:05.90]It's alright.
[353:07.60]I- You took a picture when I- No, but I- Hold on.
[353:12.34]Important.
[353:12.82]What's this one?
[353:13.56]No.
[353:14.00]Did I lose this battery?
[353:15.92]Hey, is this your battery?
[353:17.63]I think it's still good.
[353:20.31]I instinctively took a photo.
[353:37.60]I'm like, so I'm... It was just ready because I was ready for anything.
[353:43.83]Everyone tells me, wait, wait, wait.
[353:45.23]You gotta wait, wait.
[353:46.29]Jeremy, wait for the action.
[353:47.89]And I saw action.
[353:48.59]Took photo.
[353:52.53]Oh, hello, dear.
[353:53.67]Why, I haven't seen you in ages.
[353:55.78]Why don't you meet me tonight at the Blue Fog?
[353:58.50]Just bring yourself.
[353:59.68]The drinks will be poured on me.
[354:05.45]If you've seen Dink Winkelstein or his co-host, Bella Starbright, you may already be a winner.
[354:11.07]The on-air pair from the show Tinseltown Triangle has disappeared without a trace.
[354:16.14]Ah, love makes people do crazy things.
[354:19.44]They're not going to show it, right?
[354:20.88]One small show for man.
[354:23.03]One giant news for mankind.
[354:38.23]It's not a porn game.
[354:39.22]Do you have any idea why my shampoo is so good for your hair?
[354:42.30]No, I don't want to fucking hear it again.
[354:44.22]I don't care what makes your hair shampoo good.
[354:45.92]We're going to the bug.
[355:14.15]I won.
[355:42.87]Not great.
[355:43.59]Not bad.
[355:44.07]Keep at it.
[355:44.51]That's the end of the game.
[355:46.81]I beat the game. $82,000.
[356:12.88]It's all good.
[356:15.62]Why are you still playing this?
[356:16.72]Because it was interesting.
[356:19.14]It was very interesting.
[356:20.08]Alright.
[356:22.21]Let's... What do I have?
[356:23.55]What can I do here?
[356:24.55]Alright, I got... It's been six hours.
[356:32.05]Yeah, let's call it here.
[356:33.05]We're going to keep going tomorrow.
[356:37.28]Because I got a lot left to do, and I don't want to start something that I know I'm going to spend at least a couple hours, two or three hours in.
[356:45.20]So, if you want to hear the plan, here's the plan.
[356:50.42]I will be streaming for the next four days in a row.
[356:57.77]Today, tomorrow, Sunday, and Monday.
[357:02.09]Monday's stream is going to be the activity book stream.
[357:07.64]And that will be the last time that I will be live until the carnival.
[357:15.53]So the 16th is the last stream of that week.
[357:18.43]You'll see me again four and a half days later.
[357:23.92]Because I want to, there's, I have a lot of these things I still want to do.
[357:30.60]The next, the next like five or six FMV games will take us into tomorrow and maybe the next day too.
[357:41.93]That was paparazzi.
[357:42.89]You know what?
[357:43.91]Those were really, really... Those were very, very... Those were good.
[357:48.51]Steven Spielberg, that was fucking hilarious.
[357:50.51]I actually hurt myself laughing at that game in the first 45 minutes of the stream.
[357:56.97]This game was fucking all over the place, but it was at least worth looking at.
[358:02.47]There's one or two others too, right?
[358:03.63]I don't even remember.
[358:07.61]But tomorrow, we are going to start tomorrow with one that is... It reminds me of Wirehead.
[358:16.92]It's apparently a huge budget FMV game.
[358:19.02]It's called Fox Hunt.
[358:22.26]There's a lot in it.
[358:23.37]I already tested it out to make sure it worked.
[358:25.03]It looks crazy.
[358:30.81]And I also have Crime Patrol 2.
[358:34.80]and that is like five six seven more of these you'll see tomorrow we'll start with that though that has been that's a pretty good place to call it I think let's turn that off turn that off put on the outro and let's say our goodbyes do the bits hang out for a little bit porn game
[359:07.74]Little do you know that some of these just pop up with fucking ridiculous fucked up shit.
[359:12.72]But I'll see you tomorrow.
[359:14.52]Same time.
[359:17.52]Let's go back a little while.
[359:19.77]Oh, also.
[359:21.47]Wait, don't leave yet.
[359:22.67]Hold on.
[359:22.93]Stay right there.
[359:26.37]The community content Discord channel is open.
[359:33.69]There is a long list of rules there.
[359:35.57]Suggest you read them.
[359:41.43]It's there.
[359:42.56]Go take a look if you're interested.
[359:45.88]At this point going forward, I will not be opening original videos, original artwork.
[359:56.09]We're going to compile them for community nights.
[359:59.21]So if you have those things, put them in that channel.
[360:02.87]And follow the rules.
[360:08.08]Follow the rules.
[360:08.76]Because they're there.
[360:10.32]And they're important.
[360:14.82]But, thank you to Pigeon for the $5 earlier today.
[360:16.81]Uh, well, I don't know if the word hang out with fans is necessarily correct.
[360:39.18]It's more... I... spend, like, an hour or two in a spot.
[360:47.27]Or... kind of just find me.
[360:49.25]You know?
[360:52.16]Follow him around and take exactly two photos.
[360:59.20]Because I will give you a... I will tell you, full-on, completely transparent with you.
[361:05.43]Um...
[361:09.13]I love talking to people, and I love hanging out, love getting grabbed, and like, hey, like, let's talk.
[361:14.40]I do it all the time when I go to conventions like this.
[361:18.08]But I kind of don't know what else to do.
[361:20.24]You know what I mean?
[361:22.88]I kind of just like, hey, hey, it's me!
[361:24.82]Hey, it's you!
[361:25.74]Alright!
[361:27.38]I don't have any fucking idea what I'm doing.
[361:32.37]It's kind of like, that's just real.
[361:35.21]Alright, we're gonna go over this way, and...
[361:39.07]Alright.
[361:40.79]Hey.
[361:44.15]Look at me.
[361:44.73]I'm just going to do look at me like five times and then fucking leave.
[361:51.60]What if I did that?
[361:52.24]What if I just was like got everybody in one place and I was just like, oh, look at me, look at me.
[361:55.76]And then I fucking sprinted out the front door.
[361:58.78]And there was a cab waiting for me and it was just like, just took off.
[362:06.30]And I just, before I left, I like threw in the air a bunch of like actor headshots that I signed.
[362:12.97]Like 50 of them.
[362:22.15]Do it.
[362:32.56]But no, I'll be around.
[362:33.88]I'm only going to be there for a little while though.
[362:37.58]Because the Carnival stream is happening the weekend before that.
[362:43.10]And I'm probably going to be pretty tired.
[362:45.50]Then I come back and I'm going to stream.
[362:48.67]Because obviously I don't want to have a scenario where I don't stream for a week, then there's one stream, and then what?
[362:55.53]I don't stream for a week again and go to TwitchCon?
[362:59.22]I'm not going to not stream for like two and a half weeks.
[363:02.12]So I'm going to come back, stream for a few days, and then go right to TwitchCon.
[363:08.62]So I'm only going to be at TwitchCon for like two days.
[363:12.24]I'm not going to be there for very long.
[363:14.52]Saturday is the day that I'm going to be at TwitchCon for the most amount of time.
[363:24.49]If I bring you candy, will you eat it?
[363:25.71]I will not eat anything that somebody hands me that I don't know where it came from.
[363:30.43]I have no idea where you got it.
[363:32.65]For all I know, like somebody could have like fucking peed on it.
[363:36.11]I don't know.
[363:37.99]Absolutely not.
[363:38.89]I will not eat any food that anybody hands me.
[363:44.65]Here, here, here, man.
[363:45.41]Eat this.
[363:46.89]Sure.
[363:48.45]Oh, what?
[363:49.49]Where did you get it?
[363:50.07]Oh, from a trash can outside.
[363:56.04]You made it.
[363:58.26]And then I go to the fucking hospital for food poisoning.
[364:01.92]That's a hard policy.
[364:02.76]Sorry, guys.
[364:09.10]No food.
[364:11.46]No drinks.
[364:17.68]And everybody gets one photo where I don't even make any emotion.
[364:22.04]I just look in the camera with a stone face.
[364:24.04]And then if you want, like, on your phone, I'll fucking, like, sign it.
[364:30.26]Just open up, like, the iPhone thing where you can draw on the picture and I'll sign the photo.
[364:35.83]I'm gonna make that a thing.
[364:37.41]Why does nobody do that?
[364:42.02]I think that... You know what?
[364:42.88]Guys, that's... I think that is new age.
[364:46.18]You take like a selfie with somebody and then... Oh, can I get your autograph?
[364:49.24]Of course you can.
[364:49.90]Open up on your phone that app and let me just go over it on the bottom.
[364:54.96]Don't tell any streamer about that.
[364:58.24]I don't want any streamers or any YouTubers or any actors.
[365:00.09]That's my thing.
[365:06.21]But no, I'll be at TwitchCon for at least the day on Saturday.
[365:12.12]Somewhere probably Saturday afternoon.
[365:14.52]I'm going to be all over the place.
[365:19.52]But thank you for the $5.
[365:23.82]Thank you, Zorro Carlos, for the $5.
[365:29.37]They say, Jeremy, I need to tell you about an awkward experience I had yesterday at work.
[365:32.85]I was working the night shift at Dunkin' Donuts and suddenly a literal bia walks through the door.
[365:37.13]Down to every feature.
[365:39.32]Tattooed gray hair, beard, dressed like a biker.
[365:43.45]The worst part is when he ordered a donut and said it almost exactly how the Biaz say it in the meeting of the Biaz.
[365:49.69]I tried so hard not to laugh thinking about it.
[365:56.92]A real life Biaz spotting.
[365:59.72]Oh, and just no big deal or anything.
[366:01.74]Just File Actor Lich is gone with their every stream 69 community subs.
[366:07.66]No, no, not no big deal.
[366:09.04]Just just every single live stream I've done in the last like two weeks almost a hundred subs from phylactery Holy shit still going still going you're still going Holy shit phylactery
[366:37.22]I could swim in a bathtub with this many subs.
[366:41.59]What?
[366:42.15]I'm in pool.
[366:42.93]This is a swimming pool full of subs.
[366:46.85]Now, it's a lot of subs.
[366:48.15]You know what I'm trying to say here.
[366:50.55]It's a lot of subs in the same place.
[366:59.58]But if I liked her, this is too much money.
[367:05.47]This is too much money.
[367:07.87]Thank you so much.
[367:09.44]But it's too much money.
[367:14.46]That's fucking insane.
[367:18.88]Ban him!
[367:25.19]No, that's... Seriously, thank you.
[367:27.09]I've said this to you every time that this happens.
[367:32.10]But...
[367:33.95]If you can't afford this, don't do it.
[367:37.69]You've given such a ridiculous amount of money.
[367:39.91]If you have like 10 fucking mil in the bank right now, then okay.
[367:43.93]Alright.
[367:46.29]Thank you.
[367:49.20]This is their college fund.
[367:51.74]No, keep that money and go to college with it!
[367:54.82]Don't get- Why is my voice doing that?
[367:58.94]At this point, I can clearly afford it or I wouldn't have internet.
[368:03.74]Wait, hold on.
[368:04.24]Implying that you can afford it because leftover you have enough money to still pay for the internet.
[368:15.12]Oh, Jesus.
[368:19.45]I can still afford to pay the internet.
[368:22.53]The entire internet.
[368:27.95]Nah, you're a ridiculous contributor to this stream.
[368:33.45]Thank you for your vat of money.
[368:43.05]It is just simmering in that pot.
[368:47.92]He sells diamonds.
[368:48.78]He's a diamond tycoon.
[368:50.82]Maybe.
[368:52.18]Whatever it is.
[368:53.40]Thank you.
[368:59.37]But... We will continue.
[369:07.54]Zorro Carlos with that $5 of the in-real-life Bia.
[369:12.62]Yeah, I mean, that's a character in GTA, essentially.
[369:16.37]And they made those characters because those characters, those people, actually, they do exist.
[369:23.05]They are kind of... They do exist.
[369:30.50]Real Biaz.
[369:36.69]A while ago, you tweeted saying that you wanted a slug woman.
[369:39.27]Is Kim that slug?
[369:42.13]By a while ago, do you mean like three years ago?
[369:46.58]When you say a while ago, that makes it sound like I said this like a month ago.
[369:49.40]It's like four years ago.
[369:55.70]Yeah, like a while ago, you said... I guess four years still is, and it is a while, right?
[370:04.08]Technically.
[370:08.60]That is true.
[370:14.22]Slug, I was, of course I'm looking for a slug.
[370:18.86]I don't want to go, I don't want to climb any mountains or ride any bikes.
[370:26.01]I want to eat a whole bag of baked lays and have the person sitting next to me not say anything about it.
[370:33.11]I want to silently be embarrassed about it and look over and, oh, no, no, no, that's fine.
[370:37.89]No, that's fine.
[370:46.64]He's avoiding the question.
[370:47.50]I just answered it.
[370:51.04]I missed this from earlier.
[370:52.02]I don't know how.
[370:53.40]But Corporal Boom gave $55.50.
[370:54.70]So, Corporal, if you're still here, thank you so much for the huge fucking $55 plus dollar.
[371:04.43]Bit drop here.
[371:06.07]This is about four hours ago.
[371:08.71]What was I doing?
[371:09.39]I must have been so locked in.
[371:11.93]Thank you so much, though, Corporal, if you're still here.
[371:15.39]Just say, Kim is my slug woman.
[371:19.66]No, but that doesn't... Alright, I said it.
[371:23.12]I just said it.
[371:23.66]But Kim is an active... Kim likes to walk places and... No, no.
[371:42.37]What I meant to say in that tweet is I'm looking for somebody that doesn't give a shit that I'm a slug.
[371:50.64]Anyways, thank you Silent Serenity for the 250.
[371:53.14]They say louder.
[371:53.94]That was during Piper.
[371:54.78]That's fucking ridiculous.
[371:58.61]Thank you Dorkube for the 250.
[372:01.38]The glitched audio from the Steven Spielberg game is the same noise I get in my ears when I experience a hypnagogic jerk.
[372:10.25]That thing where you're about to fall asleep and your muscles freak out and wake you up.
[372:18.88]That's terrifying.
[372:20.56]Because I know the noise you're talking about.
[372:30.79]Uh, thank you, TheTickles, for $15, they say.
[372:33.79]Imagine a world where Jerma's games worked.
[372:37.75]I think we got some pretty good mileage out of these today.
[372:42.92]Besides the Steven Spielberg game crash.
[372:46.46]They worked pretty well.
[372:50.64]And, I mean, obviously, Piper, the audio is not working at all.
[372:55.42]That's alright.
[372:58.53]Too bad the rat game didn't work.
[372:59.89]I know.
[373:01.55]I know.
[373:04.73]Unfortunate.
[373:07.83]That would have been an absolute crowd pleaser.
[373:10.48]I know it.
[373:11.56]But thanks for the $15.
[373:13.48]Thank you.
[373:15.46]Like four broke today?
[373:17.64]What was the other one?
[373:19.50]I did Steven Spielberg Director.
[373:23.06]I did Piper.
[373:25.08]Paparazzi.
[373:27.58]And that was it, right?
[373:29.96]It was only three tonight, right?
[373:33.29]Am I losing my mind?
[373:34.75]Did I play other ones?
[373:35.39]I don't know.
[373:36.67]I didn't play any other ones.
[373:42.83]No, not tonight.
[373:43.25]I don't know.
[373:47.35]Only three.
[373:52.58]But thank you.
[373:54.98]Be careful.
[373:55.44]Take care of yourself.
[373:56.00]Don't strain too much.
[373:56.46]Uh... No, this is a new problem.
[373:57.02]I don't know what the hell is wrong with me.
[373:58.44]Oops.
[373:58.58]Oops.
[374:20.09]I had, like, the colonoscopy.
[374:21.73]I've had a bunch of fucking tests and shit.
[374:23.93]I don't know.
[374:24.51]I'm sorry.
[374:25.43]I just, like, hit you.
[374:26.93]And I really didn't mean to.
[374:30.17]I've had, like, stomach and abdomen pain for, like, six months.
[374:34.77]That radiates into my back.
[374:35.77]And nobody knows what the hell's wrong with me.
[374:38.55]So, still trying to figure that out.
[374:39.65]And I don't think it has anything to do with the colitis.
[374:42.79]So, it's annoying.
[374:45.57]But... Yeah.
[374:49.27]Yeah.
[374:53.41]Appendix?
[374:54.51]Maybe.
[374:54.91]I don't think so, though.
[374:56.57]It's not where I get all my issues.
[375:00.40]Stop sitting so much?
[375:01.30]I walk around.
[375:02.34]I don't sit that much at all.
[375:04.06]Contrary to popular belief, guys, I don't sit down for a very long time, besides this.
[375:09.12]Besides streaming, I'm typically up, walking around.
[375:13.28]Kim and I will go places, we'll go do something.
[375:16.03]I don't sit that often, unless it's right here.
[375:20.59]And remember, I only stream like three times a week.
[375:24.25]Sometimes like four.
[375:28.33]But it probably has something to do with it.
[375:30.29]Maybe a little bit.
[375:33.11]Because this is a new issue from the last probably seven or eight months.
[375:37.11]Right before I left.
[375:38.16]It was like two months before I moved out of Massachusetts when this started happening.
[375:41.74]I don't know.
[375:47.42]I've had so many doctors talk to me about it.
[375:52.30]But whatever, you just, we keep going.
[375:56.06]Keep trying to figure out what the fuck's going on, right?
[376:06.73]What you do when you don't stream.
[376:08.17]I imagine you just wait in an empty room until your next stream.
[376:12.35]I'm just like an android that goes into a closet and like Kim turns the button on the back of my neck off.
[376:19.69]And then a day or two goes by and she turns it back on and sits me down and I just boot up.
[376:25.70]And a T-pose.
[376:30.02]God.
[376:34.80]Thank you, Graytax, for the 10 bucks.
[376:37.57]I knew the name Lhasa Apso sounded familiar because that's the name of a dog breed that originated from Tibet.
[376:45.05]Anyways, love your streams and I hope you are loving life and kicking ass.
[376:51.41]Yeah, I'm having a good time.
[376:54.17]Things are going pretty well.
[376:57.14]I really can't complain that much.
[376:58.40]Things are going great.
[377:01.84]Thank you.
[377:03.02]For the 10 bucks.
[377:06.54]I love dogs.
[377:08.21]I really do.
[377:11.19]S10W update.
[377:13.95]Slow update, thanks to the five dolls.
[377:17.75]Hey, Jerma, just wanted to donate before the big day.
[377:19.37]Hope the carnival is a massive success.
[377:22.29]Because I borrowed a lot of money... Money... I borrowed a lot of money from the mafia.
[377:31.82]Combine those two things.
[377:32.96]To give you bits, and I need to prove my money was put to good use, because if they don't, they'll take my house and my kidneys.
[377:38.28]Good luck, and I hope for the best.
[377:40.07]You already know what's next.
[377:41.53]Peace and love.
[377:42.49]Peace and love.
[377:46.27]Thank you for the $5, slow update.
[377:52.94]I can't think of very many things that I've been looking forward to more, at least in the last... I would say in the last five years.
[378:00.34]I truly mean this.
[378:01.80]The Carnival stream is the... I've been looking forward to this more than anything, I think, in the last five years.
[378:10.28]At least the last three.
[378:13.88]Why would you borrow $5 from the Mafia?
[378:17.01]Yeah, I don't know why you would do that either.
[378:23.70]Not even live-action Jerma Rumble?
[378:27.50]It's different, though.
[378:30.00]Because this is actually live-action something-something.
[378:38.05]And plus, the live-action Rumble was a long fucking time ago.
[378:42.63]Was it 2014? 2015?
[378:46.33]That was five, almost five fucking years ago.
[378:48.65]2016, was it?
[378:54.93]I thought it was 2015.
[378:55.57]I don't even know my own channel.
[379:03.93]Was that, that was in 2016?
[379:04.79]No.
[379:16.99]When did I make this video?
[379:22.98]When the fuck did I make this video?
[379:26.48]Holy shit, it was.
[379:27.50]It was August of 2016.
[379:28.30]17, 18, 19... No, this has been more than three years.
[379:32.72]That's almost five.
[379:37.91]What did I say?
[379:38.29]I said four originally.
[379:41.33]That's been more than three years.
[379:42.57]That's a long time.
[379:45.03]But yeah, I mean, I...
[379:47.33]This is a live event.
[379:49.89]That is not just a live event.
[379:51.39]It's a live event that has a ton of participation.
[379:53.81]And a ton of work has gone into it.
[379:57.29]It's not just, hey, like for instance, I've always wanted to do like a live wrestling thing.
[380:02.18]But that would just be like a presentation, a live presentation.
[380:05.10]This is not just a live presentation.
[380:06.44]This is a live presentation that is completely and totally dictated by what you guys are going to do.
[380:24.32]gonna be total anarchy we'll see I'm I cannot wait to see what you guys do I cannot wait what was that like weird cadence there weird but yeah we'll see I'm gonna laugh my ass off if get down there and set everything up and this this is like a blackout here we go let's start the carnival
[380:58.50]You would laugh?
[380:59.38]No, I would go, No!
[381:01.66]Get it back on!
[381:05.40]Get it back on!
[381:07.64]Who's responsible for this?
[381:10.14]Who did it?
[381:12.24]And by the way, I'm looking up into the sky.
[381:17.74]Like, it's nobody's fault.
[381:18.68]I'm looking up into the sky going, Which one of you did it?
[381:22.00]Who did it?
[381:26.79]He's cursing God.
[381:28.83]Which one of you did it?
[381:32.65]Trump whisper?
[381:35.52]Which one of you did it?
[381:37.86]Let me tell you.
[381:39.52]I'm serious.
[381:40.02]No, that was like Eric Cartman.
[381:42.36]You're wrong.
[381:50.46]No, these guys are fucking pros.
[381:53.28]These guys are so good.
[381:54.30]They're incredibly talented.
[381:55.48]They're really, really great at what they do.
[381:57.36]They're great people.
[382:00.02]I am insanely lucky to have been put in contact with the people at Andy Mark.
[382:06.36]Because holy shit, they are awesome.
[382:10.00]They are so fucking awesome.
[382:13.08]It's such a relief.
[382:16.06]Trust me when I say it.
[382:21.51]Did you hire an entire circus?
[382:23.27]Not the whole thing.
[382:30.30]But... Thank you, slow update.
[382:33.70]I hope it goes good, too.
[382:37.32]Hunter Johnson, thanks for the five dollars.
[382:38.87]Hey, Jeremy, I've been watching your streams and videos for a couple of years, and... Now... Years now, and you haven't gone stale.
[382:45.37]Keep it up.
[382:49.75]Um...
[382:54.77]I can't do the same thing twice.
[382:58.75]Now, I know that the way that I approach things, and the way that I... Oh, what do I want to do?
[383:03.62]What do I think is funny?
[383:05.60]You stay in the same realm of what you think is funny.
[383:10.13]But if I don't think something's interesting, or if I don't think something is funny, I'm not going to do it, and I don't care about it.
[383:25.94]She doesn't care.
[383:29.25]I'm talking about putting, like, time into a project.
[383:35.25]You've been saying Biafa ten years now, and it hasn't gotten old.
[383:38.47]Well, that's what I mean, like, I... But we've moved on.
[383:43.56]I killed all the memes before.
[383:46.55]I like to try things, new things, different things.
[383:50.52]As much as I can, right?
[383:52.20]And obviously I don't, you know, I'm never going to say the word beer ever again.
[383:56.30]That's not funny.
[383:57.92]I never thought it was funny.
[383:59.78]I can't believe you fucking think this is still funny.
[384:03.18]I do still think that's funny.
[384:04.26]I do.
[384:05.75]I don't know.
[384:07.45]I don't do it all the time.
[384:08.29]What about shpee?
[384:11.39]Not that on the other hand.
[384:22.38]I'm kidding.
[384:23.00]I love all my joke children Even the ones that don't eat their vegetables
[384:40.87]But if you don't think I'm stale, that makes me happy, because I don't want anybody to, you know?
[384:47.09]I don't want people to come to this stream and be like, oh, this, like, this, oh, stale, shitty, oh, Jerma985, wow, holy, I remember he's been around for, like, ten years, holy, wow, in the last few years, mm, pfft, not been very good.
[385:00.32]Ooh, yeah, he really needs to fucking, like, stop, because, like, holy shit, I don't want anyone to think that.
[385:11.29]You know, I want to... I want to be like an entertaining streamer.
[385:17.60]I don't want to be the guy that you talk about.
[385:19.02]Like, I remember when he used to be fucking okay.
[385:20.74]And now he... This guy sucks.
[385:23.72]No, I don't.
[385:24.94]Everything's still going just fine.
[385:26.72]I don't want to be...
[385:38.69]He doesn't know.
[385:49.08]He said it.
[385:50.02]Uh-oh.
[385:53.78]Yeah, I don't want to be stale.
[385:55.62]And if I ever feel like I am stale, then I'm just gonna stop.
[386:00.20]I'm not gonna do it anymore.
[386:02.43]If I don't think... If I'm not having a good time, and if I don't think I'm doing something that I think is interesting or fun, I'm not gonna do it anymore.
[386:08.92]Why would I do it?
[386:20.62]Do it for money.
[386:21.40]I can't, though.
[386:32.92]I have to want to turn this stream on, guys.
[386:35.17]Like, I can't just... Well, you know, I'll make money if I turn it on.
[386:38.65]Are you serious?
[386:42.33]What the fuck am I going to talk about?
[386:43.82]What am I going to do?
[387:00.31]Just talk with the VR voice and we'll give subs.
[387:07.55]Ugh, I'm, like, burping.
[387:13.38]Yeah.
[387:14.80]No.
[387:16.06]No.
[387:16.66]No, I'm not into that.
[387:19.62]Once I, like, run out of shit I want to do and... If I stop having fun... Then I'm just gonna... I'm just gonna move on.
[387:26.49]You know, that's not gonna... I don't think that'll happen anytime soon.
[387:33.47]We've talked about this before, guys.
[387:34.73]We've talked about this a few times before.
[387:36.02]You guys already know this.
[387:38.36]You don't need me to tell you this.
[387:39.48]You know this already.
[387:54.63]He's already talking about retirement.
[388:01.18]Yeah, but we're in this world.
[388:03.06]You know, it's a very volatile world.
[388:06.58]In the online kind of Twitch YouTuber.
[388:09.53]I don't know.
[388:10.13]I don't know what's going to happen.
[388:11.25]I didn't predict I was going to be on Twitch.
[388:13.77]I didn't even know I was going to be making YouTube videos.
[388:16.90]I don't know.
[388:30.64]Stream from your retirement house.
[388:32.22]Maybe?
[388:33.94]If I can still have a good time streaming, I'll be 100.
[388:37.48]What would I do for money if streaming wasn't profitable?
[388:50.70]Um... I don't know.
[388:53.18]I'd figure it out.
[388:59.17]I have a few backup plans.
[389:04.85]I'd figure it out.
[389:10.19]I'd be a clown veterinarian.
[389:16.76]Are you implying that clowns are animals?
[389:21.08]What?
[389:24.76]But anyways.
[389:26.49]I'd figure something out.
[389:29.63]I'd be just fine.
[389:31.41]Don't worry.
[389:35.17]Phylactery, again, thanks for the 69 community subs and the $50 that you gave that I missed 15 minutes ago.
[389:40.54]50 more dollars from Phylactery loaded.
[389:48.71]Jerma, imagine if your teeth were flaccid and they only got hard when you were hungry.
[389:52.47]MonkaS.
[389:56.21]That just makes me think about the Ren and Stimpy episode when he has the nerve endings all through his whole mouth.
[390:02.66]Blah.
[390:04.28]That's the most uncomfortable fucking episode I've ever seen in my life.
[390:07.70]Of any TV show.
[390:09.94]Oh, and they're like, boom, pulling him out.
[390:11.80]Holy shit, I forgot about how horrible that episode was.
[390:17.47]Oh my god.
[390:18.85]Yep.
[390:18.93]I don't want to think about that.
[390:30.36]I loved that show, though.
[390:33.36]But thank you, Phylactery, for the $50.
[390:37.69]And all these subs that you gave.
[390:40.09]We're about to see a bunch of them right now.
[390:41.77]Why don't we look at them?
[390:46.09]Thank you, everybody, for subbing.
[390:48.17]Is it still September?
[390:49.17]It's still September, right?
[390:51.80]I think so.
[390:52.38]Yeah, it is.
[390:55.22]Well, it's September.
[390:56.02]It is September.
[390:56.64]Alright, okay.
[390:59.38]At least half off.
[391:00.89]Sounds like you'd like to see some more serious work from me.
[391:18.62]That's the plan.
[391:20.91]Hey, remember we talked about all that stuff about staying interested and wanting to keep my streams fresh and make sure I still enjoy what I'm doing and still like doing this and care about it more and more and more?
[391:30.69]That's how.
[391:32.40]Is to do more and more projects with the right people now to always have another thing to look forward to.
[391:45.69]That's the idea.
[391:47.95]Kind of a trial run.
[391:51.77]But thank you to all Mew for the 250.
[391:53.13]Hey Jerma, long time fan.
[391:54.27]Been watching since 2006.
[391:54.95]Surprise, you haven't found me yet.
[391:57.83]Keep it up.
[391:58.19]I haven't found you yet.
[392:02.07]Surprise, you haven't found me yet.
[392:03.74]Found you.
[392:09.24]Where should I be looking?
[392:11.22]There you are.
[392:11.60]Surprise, you haven't found me yet.
[392:16.90]He's like under the stairs.
[392:23.07]That's fucked up.
[392:29.41]He's on the ceiling.
[392:32.31]He's Tom Cruise tethering from the ceiling.
[392:39.00]But thank you, that's a long fucking time.
[392:42.22]That is an insane amount of time.
[392:46.08]That is 12 years.
[392:48.47]Holy shit.
[392:50.05]I haven't even been alive that long.
[393:03.19]Hey, C4G, thanks for the 250.
[393:04.25]Uh... If there were two guys on the moon and one killed the other with a rock, would that be fucked up or what?
[393:16.52]Uh, yeah.
[393:19.58]I think killing anybody with a rock is fucked up.
[393:22.52]I don't know where the context is here.
[393:27.97]But thank you.
[393:29.89]C4G for the 250.
[393:30.93]Thank you, Silent Serenity for the 250.
[393:34.69]Jerma, at the risk of sounding like one of those guys, have you tried marijuana since you moved to Nevada?
[393:40.77]I had the realization the other day that it's legal here.
[393:43.41]And I'm a responsible adult.
[393:44.85]Kind of weird when you think about it like that.
[393:47.83]Uh, yes.
[393:49.89]I have.
[393:55.41]I did, I, yeah.
[394:01.10]Don't, don't tell anybody.
[394:02.14]Don't take any photos of me doing that.
[394:11.69]Drug addict gambler.
[394:20.24]He does it before he streams.
[394:22.79]I'm calling the police.
[394:23.99]It's legal in Nevada.
[394:27.33]Recreational marijuana is legal in the state of Nevada.
[394:33.48]So?
[394:45.17]My mom told me to turn the stream off.
[394:51.02]I don't... You know what?
[394:53.02]Who cares?
[394:53.46]What am I going to tell you?
[394:54.94]What am I going to tell you that you don't already know?
[395:07.19]Calling my mom and telling her how cool you are.
[395:15.44]That saying that you smoked marijuana is as interesting as saying that you just got out of the dentist.
[395:20.65]Like, is it... Well, who cares?
[395:22.43]Hey, I just, uh... I just had a crown put in.
[395:35.70]Okay.
[395:38.36]Cool.
[395:39.28]Does it feel better?
[395:41.10]Yeah.
[395:43.14]Yeah, it does.
[395:44.99]Nice.
[395:45.19]Is there anything else you'd like to share with me?
[395:47.67]Yeah, I smoked a joint.
[395:51.77]Like an hour ago, too.
[395:54.69]Okay.
[395:57.15]How did that make you feel?
[395:59.01]I felt pretty good.
[396:01.47]Nice.
[396:04.57]Well, I didn't, because I was streaming.
[396:06.63]I've been sitting here, I've been live for like seven hours.
[396:08.95]I can't do it right now.
[396:11.36]I wouldn't want to... I don't... No.
[396:16.30]I know.
[396:16.52]Here it comes.
[396:17.28]Here it comes.
[396:18.02]Oh, there.
[396:20.24]You drink on stream sometimes.
[396:28.77]Yeah.
[396:36.09]I drink like one beer sometimes on stream.
[396:39.93]Two boxes of wine.
[396:42.63]And then just like.
[396:44.88]go downstairs to the fridge and like eat food and go to bed you guys know that every time that I drink wine on this stream I will drink a bunch of wine and then I will just go open the fridge give me that I just eat a bunch of stuff and then I just go face first into the bed and just sleep
[397:13.52]And I don't... Look, I'm... Why would I ever get, like, drunk to a point on stream that I would... It was, like, embarrassing.
[397:20.31]I mean, it's happened once or twice.
[397:22.59]But not that... No.
[397:23.51]I'm always... I'm totally always with it.
[397:27.01]I would never drink to complete excess on stream.
[397:31.55]That's not... I wouldn't do that.
[397:35.48]That does... It happens a lot.
[397:36.58]What do you mean that happens a lot?
[397:37.84]No, it does not.
[397:38.70]That's happened, like, once when I did the fucking pretend backflip.
[397:41.22]I remember that stream.
[397:42.42]That was a VR stream.
[397:46.12]There's only been like two or three true times where I've been like shit-faced on stream.
[397:50.28]And it was that eight-hour VR stream where I did the backflip.
[397:59.81]What about the Labo stream?
[398:05.35]Whatever.
[398:07.79]That's different though.
[398:14.69]Alright, let's get out of here.
[398:16.89]Thank you to, uh, Silent Surrounding the Duel.
[398:19.97]If you, if you, if it's illegal where you are, and you're responsible, be responsible, fucking adult, and do what you want, as long as it's legal.
[398:31.14]Don't be stupid.
[398:34.44]Then, go for it.
[398:37.84]And that's all I gotta say about that.
[398:44.49]Have a wonderful rest of your night.
[398:45.61]I'll see you guys tomorrow.
[398:46.45]We'll be back at it again with more.
[398:48.75]I told you this was going to be FMV week.
[398:52.90]See you tomorrow.
[398:53.28]We're going to start with Fox Hunt.
[398:56.24]Take care.
[398:57.88]See you soon.
[398:59.98]Have a wonderful day.
[399:02.18]Have a wonderful night because it's late now.
[399:05.88]See you tomorrow.
