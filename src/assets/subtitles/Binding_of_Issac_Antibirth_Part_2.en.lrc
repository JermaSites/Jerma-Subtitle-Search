[04:07.33]Jerma, it feels so weird that it's been so long since you were playing Stardew Valley.
[04:10.13]11 months of stream sucks.
[04:13.11]I'm waiting for a substantial update.
[04:16.17]I will definitely play.
[04:16.87]It looks like Isaac is going to win.
[04:18.09]It looks like Isaac is going to win.
[04:28.16]Why am I... You are almost reaching 100,000.
[04:30.58]I just passed 100,000 followers.
[04:33.94]Thanks so much, guys, for the 100k.
[04:41.75]I'm humbled that I could get to 100,000 followers on Twitch in like four and a half months.
[04:49.27]That's fucking crazy.
[04:50.07]You guys are awesome.
[04:59.36]Alright, looks like an Isaac it is.

[05:02.10]See if we can win.
[05:05.20]And let's turn it on.
[05:06.40]We're on like a black screen right now.
[05:07.54]Sorry about that.
[05:11.47]This has to be dropped.
[05:19.00]Don't even tell me.
[05:21.00]Did Twitch chat go down again?
[05:23.08]Two nights in a row?
[05:26.34]No.
[05:29.66]Did it actually fucking do that?
[05:36.31]I think it did.
[05:37.37]I can't see anything.
[05:43.50]Hold on.
[05:43.76]Let me just make sure.
[05:44.90]Yeah, I can't see shit.
[05:52.65]Oh, come on, Twitch.
[05:53.57]Really?
[05:53.91]Two nights in a row?
[05:57.65]At, like, the same exact time, too, it happened.
[05:59.55]Let me just refresh the page and make sure it's not just me.
[06:09.94]Is it just me?
[06:12.88]Oh, it's working fine.
[06:13.54]Yeah, what the fuck is going on then?
[06:16.79]I guess it, like, freaked out when I opened up Isaac.
[06:21.17]Okay, now I can see you guys.
[06:23.55]Thank God.
[06:24.15]Alright, let's go.
[06:25.15]Binding with Isaac.
[06:26.01]Binding with Isaac it is.
[06:30.51]Switch to it.
[06:34.15]Game capture.
[06:34.83]There it is.
[06:38.51]My controller is plugged in.
[06:41.62]I still hope it is.
[06:42.18]Alright.
[06:46.50]Oh, no.
[06:47.64]What the fuck's going on here?
[06:51.78]Follow your instructions, Lord.
[06:53.98]I have faith in thee, Isaac's mother replied as she locked Isaac in his room away from the evils of the world.
[07:01.12]Wait, what?
[07:02.20]Better come to your birthday party and do your wondrous magic.
[07:06.89]I don't do house calls.
[07:07.65]No house calls.
[07:08.97]I will ask one more thing of you.
[07:10.19]Yes, Lord.
[07:10.65]Anything.
[07:11.79]To prove your love and devotion.
[07:22.81]Congrats on 100k.
[07:24.21]Thank you, Smooth Coffee.
[07:25.07]Thanks for the 50 bucks.
[07:26.13]That's extremely generous of you.
[07:30.43]Alright, let's change this to... Yes, Lord, she replied, grabbing a butcher's knife from the kitchen.
[07:42.00]Isaac, watching through a crack in his door, trembled in fear.
[07:46.74]Get away from the IRL section.
[07:48.00]Binding of Isaac.
[07:48.88]Alright.
[07:49.10]Now let's play.
[07:49.50]No filter?
[07:49.74]I won't do a filter.
[07:50.42]I'm on a losing streak though, unfortunately.
[08:14.39]But, again, thank you so much everybody that stuck around for that.
[08:18.23]Hopefully it was interesting enough.
[08:20.97]Something that I, like, had for, like, months just sitting in my house.
[08:24.81]But, thank you Smooth Coffee again.
[08:26.11]Thank you for the subs and bits and everything.
[08:27.46]You guys are fucking incredible.
[08:30.48]Oh, we're gonna go with... We're gonna go Judas.
[08:37.38]Judas.
[08:41.30]It's Antibirth.
[08:41.87]There's no option for Antibirth, unfortunately.
[08:46.11]Minus one.
[08:47.83]Yeah.
[08:48.73]I'm a minus one streamer.
[08:49.97]Don't you guys know that?
[08:54.03]I only do minus one.
[08:55.29]I should probably open up the Wikipedia page too, by the way.
[09:02.27]Get insta-killed.
[09:03.11]I don't think I'll get insta-killed.
[09:05.87]I'll probably die a couple times, though.
[09:10.96]Is your brother Kane?
[09:13.64]The Undertaker.
[09:16.36]That will be useful in the next room, right?
[09:20.89]No, I can't pull chests.
[09:22.27]Shit!
[09:31.29]I donated the last bits to get my $100 badge.
[09:36.40]Well, thanks a lot, dude.
[09:39.98]That is fucking another person with a $100 badge.
[09:45.52]Are there any extra HUD options?
[09:46.48]What is it, like F6 or something?
[09:51.31]Kind of gets in the way though, don't it?
[09:52.43]I don't know, I feel like that just gets in the way for me.
[09:58.63]I'm gonna just, I like to look at them every now and then.
[10:00.31]I like having them more screen real estate.
[10:09.54]Wow, easy.
[10:10.18]Alright, I got some bombs.
[10:12.34]Let's go check those.
[10:14.80]What's this music?
[10:15.38]This is the new... Antibirth.
[10:19.46]This is the community mod, Antibirth.
[10:23.66]So, there are new songs.
[10:25.91]It's pretty much a complete, total mod of Rebirth, not of Antibirth.
[10:39.10]Set up your HUD off set, then.
[10:45.09]I don't know how to do that.
[10:50.91]Mr. Bomb.
[10:51.93]I don't want Mr. Bomb.
[10:52.88]But we're going to use Mr. Bomb over here.
[10:55.14]Just to see if this is the secret room.
[10:57.56]Which it is.
[11:02.18]Cool.
[11:03.86]Let's go fight the boss.
[11:06.60]First stream you can catch in a while.
[11:07.62]Well, welcome, dude.
[11:10.36]Welcome to the stream.
[11:13.29]I need my two doctors to be able to play this game.
[11:17.69]You wish you could donate bits, but you only have... No, don't worry about it, dude.
[11:21.18]I'm just going to blow this up.
[11:25.34]Hey, 985.
[11:25.62]Look at that.
[11:26.28]I don't even know what that is, but who cares?
[11:36.88]Coin.
[11:39.25]Bomb the mushrooms.
[11:40.19]Oh, shit.
[11:40.69]That's right.
[11:41.17]I forgot about that.
[11:47.98]I can still get in there, right?
[11:57.30]Nothing.
[12:02.60]Ooh, a pill.
[12:05.58]Speed up.
[12:06.64]Can I get them all with this last one?
[12:09.58]Another pill.
[12:12.40]Uh, well, I can do this.
[12:18.30]I'm an idiot.
[12:20.72]Well, that's what happens when you're a fucking idiot.
[12:22.18]I'm an idiot.
[12:33.53]Hello, old man.
[12:34.53]Oh, hi.
[12:36.23]What's better?
[12:36.61]What is this?
[12:37.45]Liberty cap.
[12:37.97]This is just a random... Does the lighter, uh... What does the lighter do?
[12:49.57]Does it just make bigger bomb radius?
[12:57.49]Short, weak, and old.
[12:59.21]Weak?
[13:01.11]I mean, I'm definitely blind, but I'm not weak.
[13:04.82]The lighter is better.
[13:06.12]No, let's keep it then.
[13:09.14]It's fire bombs, yeah.
[13:10.36]Okay, cool.
[13:13.40]Cool.
[13:13.60]Did I miss any rocks?
[13:19.89]No.
[13:28.64]Hey, thanks.
[13:34.36]Boo?
[13:35.69]Wait, boo?
[13:37.59]Boo, I don't understand this.
[13:40.37]You subscribed for eight months and then you subscribed for nine months today.
[13:44.97]Did a month go by already?
[13:46.25]I don't understand.
[13:57.16]Oh, there's one.
[13:59.08]Uh... I don't think I can get it, though.
[14:00.90]Oh, yeah, I can.
[14:03.50]Just buy a bomb.
[14:04.68]Five bucks!
[14:05.34]I'm buying one.
[14:05.90]Don't care.
[14:06.84]Too lazy.
[14:09.05]Worth it.
[14:14.79]Don't care.
[14:17.05]You've been following me since I had 1,000 subs.
[14:19.09]Well, fucking hello, dude.
[14:21.65]Thanks for being around.
[14:23.49]You wonderful, beautiful son of a gun.
[14:26.79]So what, Booey?
[14:27.43]Boo, you, like, wanna fucking help me here?
[14:31.90]You gonna, like, come into, like, TeamSpeak and help me play this game, Boo?
[14:35.18]Is that what you're saying?
[14:37.74]I need help.
[14:38.52]I don't know what I'm doing.
[14:39.28]I'm terrible at this game.
[14:42.88]If you wanna help me, Boo, I'm hanging out in the streamer channel.
[14:48.35]I need guidance.
[14:51.45]So bad.
[14:52.93]It's up to you.
[14:59.76]Hey, Sheplin.
[15:00.94]And TacticalSquidKid.
[15:02.80]And Neuro.
[15:03.46]Thank you, Neuro.
[15:04.92]And Boo.
[15:08.94]There's a rock in there.
[15:11.47]I'll have to come back.
[15:16.35]And thank you, AKA Salmon.
[15:18.84]Come on.
[15:28.91]Is Boo raiding again?
[15:30.01]I think so.
[15:31.09]I think he's doing fairly well.
[15:36.15]God damn it.
[15:46.00]Please, Boo.
[15:46.64]Please help him.
[15:53.16]Shit, shot speed down.
[15:54.58]Damn it, damn it, damn it.
[16:03.18]Out of the way.
[16:13.70]That's cool.
[16:14.50]I can just grab it.
[16:23.77]Judas!
[16:26.43]How many DLCs are there for Isaac?
[16:27.87]There are a lot.
[16:29.76]Hi, Jello.
[16:30.62]Hey!
[16:31.78]I'm sorry, I'm not sticking around.
[16:34.28]You're thinking this by the message.
[16:37.18]I'm playing Overwatch with my guildies.
[16:40.66]I was waiting the queue because people were getting switched on your stream, and I just missed the magic show.
[16:48.59]Well, it's alright.
[16:50.93]It was definitely a magic show, for sure.
[16:55.31]Fucking hell, I can't wait to watch it.
[16:57.15]Alright, I gotta run.
[16:57.89]I don't know if I'll be around tonight, but maybe tomorrow?
[17:01.04]Yeah, yeah.
[17:01.60]I'll talk to you soon, dude.
[17:02.88]Alright, have fun.
[17:03.50]Wait, wait, before you go.
[17:04.70]Hmm?
[17:05.20]What's the lighter do?
[17:05.86]I have no idea.
[17:07.94]Alright, let's go.
[17:08.50]Go, quick.
[17:15.10]Shit.
[17:16.80]Wait, it has to be up here, right?
[17:21.29]Shit.
[17:24.71]Damn it.
[17:30.01]Hey, it's alright.
[17:32.26]We found it anyways.
[17:37.82]Cue the fool.
[17:41.64]Come on.
[17:43.68]What a joke.
[17:51.70]These exploding bombs.
[17:52.98]This is kind of overwhelming me.
[17:58.79]Yeah, I know what it does.
[17:59.69]I'm just, uh... I'm just giving Boo some shit.
[18:08.42]Hey, Verilic.
[18:09.02]Thanks for the five bucks.
[18:09.76]Remember when my reset was stuck at 12 months?
[18:11.64]Well, now I'm back down to four somehow.
[18:14.94]Well, that's fucked up.
[18:15.72]Thank you, Cookie Master.
[18:18.38]Lowen Arabeck.
[18:19.68]Thanks for the subs.
[18:24.37]Yeah, sorry.
[18:24.93]I sound like a broken record right now, but I could not see anything earlier, just like last time.
[18:32.08]I need to get another monitor or something, man.
[18:35.38]I need to make a couple of investments.
[18:40.34]This felt like those awkward call a friend in who wants to be a millionaire.
[18:46.46]Phone a friend, yeah.
[18:47.46]I lost one of my lifelines talking to Boo there.
[18:58.12]Get Star in here.
[18:58.84]I don't know where Star is.
[19:00.60]Is Star streaming?
[19:01.34]He might even be streaming right now.
[19:04.04]Possibly.
[19:08.55]I got money.
[19:09.03]Let's go to the coin room.
[19:14.47]You're about to do your homework.
[19:18.51]Not even 60 FPS?
[19:19.45]This is 60 FPS.
[19:20.01]What are you talking about?
[19:24.04]This is a 60 FPS stream.
[19:25.40]Come on, man.
[19:29.01]It better be.
[19:30.67]I'll be mad.
[19:32.39]Mr. Rockwell.
[19:33.01]I'm going to try to get a couple of bombs.
[19:38.24]Is there an item tracker for Antibirth?
[19:39.52]I think there is.
[19:47.49]Oh, it's two keys.
[19:48.47]I'm not... This is not terrible.
[19:49.57]I'm just going to use the other machine.
[19:55.25]Come on, come on, come on.
[19:55.95]Give me something.
[19:57.41]15 FPS?
[19:57.91]No way.
[19:58.39]This is not 15 FPS.
[20:05.54]Child's... Alright, that's the... I'm gonna end up dying accidentally, I know it.
[20:17.26]Come on.
[20:23.46]Come on, give me those bombs.
[20:25.10]Let me get the bombs.
[20:26.74]Shit.
[20:29.57]Eight FPS.
[20:31.97]Bombs, come on.
[20:32.69]That's so unfortunate.
[20:43.51]Well, I lost all my money.
[20:47.60]Still haven't figured out if this works.
[20:48.56]Well, thanks, Jim.
[20:49.36]It does.
[20:50.90]And Dean Ziggs with nine months says, Hey, Jeremy, I've been playing Plague Inc.
[20:54.74]and I can't think of a good name for my next disease.
[20:56.46]Could you give me one?
[20:57.02]Also, awesome magic show.
[20:58.26]I hope you're doing alright.
[20:59.12]I don't know.
[21:02.94]I'm not good at naming illnesses in that game.
[21:10.02]Should I... Hold on.
[21:10.96]Let me see what this does.
[21:12.14]I need my Wikipedia page.
[21:19.40]There's a bomb in the secret room.
[21:20.32]I'll go get it.
[21:22.86]I'll go get it, don't worry.
[21:23.48]I just need to make sure I have this open at all times.
[21:27.11]What are you doing, man?
[21:31.13]There we go.
[21:32.21]It...
[21:41.99]Just gives a higher chance to get hearts.
[21:44.62]I'm Judas right now.
[21:45.62]I don't think they're really not going to do much for me.
[21:48.64]Just go.
[21:54.43]Just go get your cheater money.
[21:57.39]I'm fucking seriously hate these rooms.
[21:59.85]I hate those rooms.
[22:01.99]Because you know why I hate those rooms?
[22:02.89]Because you forget they exist.
[22:04.73]And then you end up walking into them like I just did and it hurts you.
[22:11.09]I just didn't even realize that room was even there.
[22:27.77]Go up.
[22:28.97]Hey, Jethro.
[22:30.63]Always been one of my favorite content creators.
[22:31.91]Keep it up.
[22:32.39]You on my list of top 10.
[22:33.67]I want to be like that guy, guys.
[22:37.21]Well, thanks a lot, Jethro.
[22:42.44]Can I go in here and not get hit?
[22:44.82]Can I get this?
[22:48.20]Get it, come on.
[22:50.97]Oh.
[22:51.79]Oh!
[22:53.07]Ah!
[22:54.59]Get me out.
[22:55.49]Seriously.
[22:58.91]Those rooms are the bane of my entire existence when I play Isaac.
[23:01.27]I just hate them.
[23:02.03]I fucking despise those rooms.
[23:05.95]It's alright.
[23:06.57]I didn't lose that much.
[23:10.55]Baby Plum.
[23:15.20]You missed the magic show?
[23:16.12]It wasn't that long.
[23:17.58]It was like 25... It was like 30 minutes long.
[23:20.40]Okay, I've never... This is a new guy.
[23:22.05]I've not fought this guy before.
[23:34.75]Damn it!
[23:35.19]I can't do a devil run unless it's something I can just take.
[23:41.43]Nope.
[23:43.72]Yeah.
[23:50.26]Hey, SCPBotman, thanks for the sub.
[23:52.72]Please play Stanley Parable on stream all endings.
[23:54.82]I've already played Stanley Parable.
[23:58.54]So I kind of already know everything that's in it.
[24:00.79]I played the whole thing.
[24:03.75]But thanks for the bits, dude.
[24:07.29]ProDean, thanks for the sub.
[24:08.83]Welcome.
[24:10.29]I can just tell you, yeah, I'll lose one spirit heart, so it's not a big deal.
[24:13.14]But, whatever.
[24:29.93]What just happened?
[24:39.08]Why did that do that?
[24:40.28]It said, uh, spirit hearts.
[24:44.68]Why did that fucking happen?
[24:52.09]Okay.
[24:56.11]Alright, I guess.
[24:58.67]I'm dead already.
[25:00.70]I've never... Presto Majesto.
[25:05.56]Presto Majesto.
[25:11.12]I thought that was going to take the one Spirit Heart because, you know, I feel like it didn't do that before.
[25:16.34]Am I crazy or did it used to not do that?
[25:25.19]If I'm crazy, I'm crazy.
[25:26.03]I'll accept it, but I don't think I am.
[25:32.97]Presto Majesto.
[25:36.53]There goes the... I thought it was like that didn't happen before.
[25:39.28]I'm so confused.
[25:51.97]That run sucked anyways.
[25:52.93]Who cares?
[25:55.60]It didn't used to do that?
[25:56.62]I'm right.
[25:57.14]Well, that's what I thought.
[25:59.24]Hey, little Stevie!
[26:06.45]There goes the gamer license.
[26:07.81]Well, I can get it back.
[26:08.71]I can always take my license test again, right?
[26:12.23]Come on.
[26:22.11]Come on, you and all your friends.
[26:24.09]Say goodbye.
[26:28.28]When am I going to play FTL?
[26:31.12]I've watched people play FTL and I've never... I'm always just like, what the fuck is going on?
[26:38.33]I feel like I would get bored of FTL very quickly just because... I don't know.
[26:44.64]Something about it.
[26:46.54]I swear to fucking God, dude.
[26:48.76]I got like caught in the...
[26:57.09]I got stuck between the pod, and just pretend you didn't see that shit.
[27:00.05]I'm playing as Samson.
[27:01.49]Fuck it.
[27:06.25]Why did that do one full heart, by the way?
[27:09.12]Okay, hit me.
[27:19.07]Hit me.
[27:19.53]Hit me.
[27:31.54]Goddamn source engine doorways.
[27:42.97]These stupid things.
[27:43.65]I hate these things.
[27:44.39]You guys know I hate these things.
[27:45.43]There's a blood tear.
[27:52.33]Well, that would explain it.
[27:55.78]Holy shield.
[27:58.22]This is a good item.
[27:58.94]This is actually a really good item to have on Samson, isn't it?
[28:01.10]You can take the hits and it doesn't matter.
[28:15.17]Have I ever played The Witcher 3?
[28:15.91]Uh, I have not.
[28:19.15]Not played The Witcher 3.
[28:27.41]Heard it's good.
[28:31.76]Good RNG, good RNG, yeah.
[28:33.04]Don't fuck it up though.
[28:33.98]I will screw it up.
[28:38.28]There's a lot of potential for me to mess things up in this game.
[28:43.74]Get out of here, you chocolate syrup.
[28:49.61]Seeing as you're getting into VR for the Resident Evil stream, allow me to recommend Elite Dangerous.
[28:55.68]Didn't that game just find aliens?
[28:57.96]Didn't somebody just find themselves, like, in an alien spaceship or something?
[29:02.16]Uh, Etalyx wanted me to play Elite Dangerous, and I have it.
[29:11.36]I think I have it.
[29:12.02]I bought it on, like, sale or something.
[29:13.96]And he's like, yeah, yeah, the tutorial and the controls, to learn the controls, it's gonna take you about, like, six hours.
[29:18.09]And I was like, alright, I think... I don't think I wanna play this.
[29:26.13]I'm not sure I want to play that game.
[29:35.97]Seems fun, though.
[29:36.57]It's like the only space simulation game that's come out that's been like any good, right?
[29:42.89]Because we all know that.
[29:47.66]What was that?
[29:47.96]What's that game by Chris Pratt that's coming out?
[29:50.30]Chris Pratt's making that space game.
[29:52.46]It's like $150 million on Kickstarter or something.
[29:58.05]But thank you, Purple, for the 10 bucks, man.
[29:59.91]Appreciate it.
[30:04.05]That's a good space, though.
[30:09.30]That's good.
[30:16.54]Oh, we just got hit by that.
[30:22.38]What did I miss?
[30:25.34]There's a bomb up there.
[30:26.16]I'll just kill the boss and just come back.
[30:33.88]Passengers the game couldn't you buy like a $5,000 ship that like eventually you'll get you'll get or something, right?
[30:46.87]Like Kerbal space program Okay, take a long time though.
[30:53.02]I Don't do well with games that take like a very long time to get going There's an FTL and in Kerbal space program don't you have to like actually build a ship I
[31:07.43]And I'm such a fucking idiot with that type of stuff.
[31:10.15]You think I'm going to be able to build a ship and have it be able to work?
[31:13.95]No way.
[31:14.75]That's not going to happen.
[31:15.97]Ball of bandages.
[31:22.56]Bandage girl, right?
[31:27.06]I do not play WoW anymore.
[31:28.08]I haven't played WoW in like since the Karazhan stream.
[31:31.38]Worst stream I've ever done.
[31:32.23]Let me look for rocks.
[31:33.39]Hold on.
[31:36.18]Ever since the worst stream I've ever done, I have not played World of Warcraft at all.
[31:45.57]We lost 2,000 people because of Isaac.
[31:48.37]I think a lot of people just kind of were there for the magic show stream.
[31:52.13]Which, by the way, I should probably change this tweet that I made earlier.
[31:57.09]Because people are probably coming from Twitter going like, this is not a fucking magic show.
[32:03.74]What the hell is this?
[32:08.71]Let me change it.
[32:12.46]Just say... play an Isaac now.
[32:20.66]I don't want to give any false... I don't want to be a fraud.
[32:45.97]Yeah, here we go.
[32:48.95]Skate 3 was a good stream?
[32:51.87]Uh, Skate 3 was... was a stream.
[32:55.90]Like, I physically streamed to twitch.tv.
[32:58.20]You got that right.
[33:01.38]Yeah, was it a good one?
[33:02.14]No, no, it wasn't.
[33:03.10]It was a stream.
[33:04.90]It was a stream.
[33:14.45]Is it a bomb?
[33:14.85]I'm not even going to open the door for no reason to.
[33:17.47]I don't want to do the curse room.
[33:25.11]I need as much health as I can get, honestly.
[33:33.42]I need that.
[33:35.76]I need it.
[33:36.72]I need it.
[33:37.02]Because I want to be able to take hits in the next room, so...
[33:44.18]Let's go.
[33:46.28]Hey, ST Box.
[33:47.24]Thanks for the 15 bucks, 1500 bits.
[33:48.94]Hey, Jerma.
[33:49.76]Big fan of yours.
[33:50.64]For years now, you've made my life quite a lot brighter.
[33:56.06]Wait, Curse Room is free when you have the Holy Mantle?
[33:57.92]Is it?
[33:58.28]How?
[34:01.44]Don't you take the first hit?
[34:02.32]I thought you, like, take the first thing of damage.
[34:13.96]Alright, that's it.
[34:14.44]Oh, whatever.
[34:15.68]Guys, I haven't played Binding of Isaac in, like, over a year.
[34:17.54]Come on.
[34:18.28]That's the excuse every time.
[34:28.71]Star, get the fuck in here.
[34:30.83]Get in here.
[34:31.37]I'm just sitting in the team, dude.
[34:33.01]I need you right now.
[34:34.63]Because, like, people are gonna think I'm a fucking idiot.
[34:36.51]Because I don't know what to do with the Holy Mantle.
[34:37.99]I didn't know, like, the Curse Room was free.
[34:40.71]Ramming Speed.
[34:43.87]What the hell does this do?
[34:49.47]You're like the curse room master.
[34:51.23]You can tell me what to do.
[34:53.65]Played it yesterday?
[34:54.33]No, I didn't.
[34:54.61]It was somebody else.
[35:03.96]Probably should be taking hits right now.
[35:05.96]I don't think I really need to.
[35:14.16]Where's the magic show?
[35:14.88]It already happened.
[35:15.48]Happened like an hour ago or so.
[35:17.10]Like 40 minutes ago.
[35:23.17]Bombs are key.
[35:23.83]Well, that was useless.
[35:29.73]Star's too busy.
[35:30.49]What?
[35:30.67]What is he doing?
[35:32.81]Ooh, a bomb.
[35:33.31]Can I ram that?
[35:34.00]Ram it.
[35:34.96]Come on.
[35:35.18]Ramming speed.
[35:45.25]I need my... I need one of my Wikipedias to be here.
[35:47.94]My Isaac Wikipedias.
[35:52.96]I'm lost without them.
[36:04.41]Give me a bomb.
[36:07.75]You want to play Left 4 Dead?
[36:09.45]I would play Left 4 Dead.
[36:10.17]I don't think I have it installed right now, though.
[36:13.61]I'd have to install it.
[36:22.50]Isaac Wikipedia.
[36:24.10]I was reading chat and I got stuck.
[36:35.40]Ooh, cool.
[36:36.36]Spall a penny.
[36:38.41]I need bombs.
[36:39.35]Bad.
[36:39.61]Should I take a couple hits?
[36:43.93]Yeah.
[36:44.41]I don't want to lose the Spirit Heart, though.
[36:49.49]If I get more than one Spirit Heart, I'll do it.
[36:55.11]Left 4 Dead 2 mods.
[37:00.15]Oh, now I see.
[37:00.98]The Holy Mantle.
[37:01.68]Do I recharge every room?
[37:07.02]Hmm...
[37:11.47]Shit, I don't have any keys.
[37:13.65]This is the Antibirth mod.
[37:20.03]This is not... The only reason why it says that it's afterbirth is just because... Because... There's no listing for it on Twitch.
[37:32.70]But this is the Antibirth, yes.
[37:39.17]Left 4 Dead is such a great game.
[37:40.21]I really wish they'd make another one.
[37:42.75]Like, come on, Valve.
[37:43.69]What's going on here?
[37:46.89]Where's the new Left 4 Dead?
[37:50.23]Didn't, like, somebody go and say that Left 4 Dead was being made?
[37:52.61]And they were like, yeah, I saw the game files for Left 4 Dead.
[37:56.55]Like, alright, well... Where is it?
[38:00.16]That was, like, four years ago.
[38:16.79]Little Steven.
[38:17.61]Another little Steven.
[38:18.51]And a devil room.
[38:21.23]Ooh.
[38:24.39]Oh boy.
[38:26.05]Oh boy.
[38:27.92]Oh boy.
[38:29.22]Okay.
[38:29.62]Time to roll the dice.
[38:31.34]I can see forever.
[38:34.90]HP up and tears down.
[38:36.24]That's not good.
[38:36.94]But what's this?
[38:38.50]Guppy.
[38:39.62]I got Guppy.
[38:41.79]Guppy's tail.
[38:42.93]We got two pieces of Guppy.
[38:44.23]Now I have to go into curse rooms.
[38:51.11]Two pieces of guppy.
[38:52.53]Let's do it.
[38:53.59]Come on.
[38:53.83]Is there a curse room here?
[38:57.97]This could be the one where I could go all the way again.
[38:59.69]Okay.
[39:04.36]That's perfect.
[39:07.64]Perfect.
[39:08.44]Yeah.
[39:08.66]I'm just going to take it and run.
[39:10.20]Just get me the hell out of here.
[39:14.12]Fuck it.
[39:20.51]Not twice in a week.
[39:21.41]Yeah, we're gonna get the RNG guppy dream twice in one week.
[39:26.01]Twice in two days, which is... I actually bet.
[39:28.77]I'm not gonna get my hopes up because it might not happen.
[39:34.01]I'll get two pieces of it and won't get the third one.
[39:39.16]You think they are doing it?
[39:41.24]Possible.
[39:45.22]Valve hasn't made a video game in so long.
[39:54.51]I think we've talked about this a lot before, but... Besides, like, Dota 2.
[40:00.84]Which, didn't they barely even have anything to do with Dota 2?
[40:03.08]Didn't they bring on, like, a bunch of, like, outside people to make Dota 2?
[40:10.98]Oh, shit.
[40:11.30]I can't open that.
[40:13.44]Vermintide is awesome.
[40:14.64]I love that game.
[40:15.42]That game is fantastic.
[40:19.82]Portal 2 was the last, really, the one that they made.
[40:24.26]Portal 2 is really good.
[40:25.90]It's just sad.
[40:28.38]Valve used to make such great stuff.
[40:31.30]And then they just got focused on VR and Steam and that was it.
[40:42.68]Shit.
[40:45.81]Valve is on the shit list right now?
[40:47.85]I wouldn't put Valve on the shit list yet.
[40:51.79]I would say...
[40:54.65]give it like another year or two and if they're still just like you know what I was trying to say if they just don't really do anything for the next like couple years we'll see what happens with the vibe see if like VR takes off and maybe they'll do some first party stuff with it who knows
[41:23.55]I don't think Antibirth works with afterbirth at this moment.
[41:27.60]I think it's only on rebirth.
[41:40.53]It's already been a couple years.
[41:44.51]Yeah, it has.
[41:48.00]But they're focusing on other stuff, I guess.
[41:50.40]Nothing anybody can really do about it.
[41:52.72]We can be upset that they're not making new, cool content, but at the same time, what are you going to do?
[42:01.98]Vermintide is a Warhammer game.
[42:03.70]I'm going to do this.
[42:12.90]Leave that.
[42:15.36]I'm going to take a couple hits.
[42:18.65]Should I even... That Spirit Heart, that Spirit Heart's what's killing me right now.
[42:27.15]Is it worth me getting rid of the Spirit Heart to get more damage for the boss, which I probably will be able to beat, no problem.
[42:33.10]I don't know.
[42:37.60]Still need to go to the item room, so no, not yet.
[42:43.88]The mod creator said that Antibirth can never be ported to Afterbirth just because of how the modding system works.
[42:50.46]Yeah, people were actually kind of mad about that, weren't they?
[42:54.60]But thank you, Gummy Monk, for the 500 bits.
[42:56.60]Stream Vermintide, damn it.
[43:00.52]I did.
[43:01.07]A long time ago.
[43:03.63]Didn't I already stream Vermintide for a little while?
[43:09.49]But thanks for the five bucks, dude.
[43:11.45]And then PaintMang, resubscribed for nine months.
[43:13.59]Thank you, PaintMang.
[43:14.49]On E-Day, now our beautiful baby boy will be born.
[43:17.43]We'll name him Burger.
[43:19.55]Thank you, PaintMang.
[43:22.52]And then KaneTheInsane subscribed a few minutes ago.
[43:26.69]And Intentional.
[43:29.01]Thank you, Intentionally.
[43:31.99]Welcome, guys.
[43:38.15]Well, that was worth it.
[43:47.36]I'll tell you right now, if I get another piece of guppy, this is going to be a very hard one to lose.
[43:53.99]If there's somebody that can lose it, it's me.
[43:57.79]I am the one that will lose that.
[43:59.05]I'm going to leave TeamSpeak because there's nobody in there, so why am I still sitting in there?
[44:07.45]Just one second.
[44:08.69]Sorry, guys.
[44:12.59]Cool.
[44:12.75]Alright.
[44:20.27]On hard mode?
[44:20.79]Yeah, it's on hard.
[44:24.13]Something that I've learned about when I play Isaac is playing on normal, it seems too easy, and playing on hard seems really hard sometimes.
[44:31.26]But going back to normal, I just can't do it.
[44:36.54]And plus, people will be like, hey, what are you doing on normal?
[44:40.16]You're streaming this game.
[44:41.12]You have to play on hard.
[44:59.74]homing bombs.
[45:00.38]Just a bunch of bombs.
[45:01.14]Alright, I got a lot of bombs now.
[45:02.40]Uh, you want to turn... Here, hold on.
[45:10.52]Here.
[45:13.09]Map opacity.
[45:13.63]How do I turn this?
[45:14.63]Like that?
[45:18.05]No.
[45:20.95]How do you make it so it's, um... How do I turn the opacity down on that?
[45:29.49]Man, that shit just gets in the way.
[45:39.66]Postal?
[45:42.14]Like in Nerdquake?
[45:44.34]Gamer license revoked.
[45:45.89]No, I didn't... Why did I lose my gamer license?
[45:47.47]No.
[45:52.15]I shouldn't have lost it.
[45:53.67]I still have it.
[45:54.21]I haven't lost it yet.
[45:54.97]You don't?
[45:57.42]No.
[46:03.66]That took a lot of damage.
[46:07.07]That was such a dangus way to do the roam.
[46:08.87]I'm, like, reading... I'm looking at chat and, like, reading what people are saying.
[46:11.97]Of course I'm gonna, like, ring around the Rosie.
[46:18.69]Alright.
[46:20.31]Is that worth taking?
[46:20.99]Let me look it up.
[46:26.92]It's, like, the nun head.
[46:28.56]Let me see if I can find it.
[46:35.06]Oh, where are you?
[46:35.84]Let me see what you do.
[46:39.88]What do you do?
[46:40.76]I think it's damage reduction, actually, isn't it?
[46:46.63]Yeah, it is.
[46:49.33]Yeah.
[46:50.71]Fanny pack?
[46:53.55]No space bar item.
[46:58.55]What does a fanny pack do?
[47:06.83]Recharges your active when you take okay, so I should just grab the fanny pack which is leave Play whatever game you want.
[47:16.84]I'm playing Isaac Where's boo boo fanny pack is bad I
[47:38.12]Just get a key.
[47:39.74]Ah, fuck it.
[47:40.34]I'm just taking a key.
[47:41.96]Extra trinket for Fanny Pack?
[47:43.55]Eh.
[47:48.07]Wow, this guy didn't even have 3,000 hours in Isaac?
[47:50.85]I know!
[47:51.25]What the hell?
[47:52.37]How dare he?
[47:55.05]Boo's not here to save me, man.
[48:04.30]Don't pick up that pill.
[48:07.68]I'm getting a key.
[48:11.16]And I'm getting the fanny pack.
[48:15.64]It's done.
[48:16.26]Wait, did I miss a coin?
[48:20.95]Fanny pack it is.
[48:28.93]I might have just done something wrong, but you know, sometimes you just gotta do something wrong.
[48:34.58]Where's the magic stream?
[48:35.28]It already happened.
[48:40.06]I don't need this blowed up.
[48:47.50]Under a thousand hours?
[48:49.54]Ruined?
[48:50.02]Why?
[48:50.66]I'm fine.
[48:57.13]I'm fine.
[48:57.41]See somebody?
[48:58.19]One guy just said, you're fine.
[48:59.39]Don't worry.
[49:09.47]Did you see the magic tricks I did earlier?
[49:10.91]I'll be alright.
[49:19.21]Is this a ranked Isaac run?
[49:21.05]No.
[49:22.51]No, it's a I suck at this game and I just like playing it because it's fun to pick up items and go, what's that do?
[49:29.85]Oh, what's that do?
[49:36.87]You don't even need to dodge those.
[49:42.69]Did I miss coins down there?
[49:43.65]Let me kill the boss, whatever.
[49:53.74]Played Risk of Rain.
[49:54.44]I played Risk of Rain for like ten minutes.
[49:59.58]The dark one.
[50:00.14]I forget what this guy does.
[50:01.10]Shit.
[50:01.84]He has a weird pattern, doesn't he?
[50:03.98]I'm gonna get hit like five times, I know it.
[50:05.63]For lunch.
[50:16.23]He does like a curly Q, doesn't he?
[50:25.24]He hasn't done it yet.
[50:26.06]Why?
[50:31.07]Why has he not done it?
[50:45.16]Ah, there it is.
[50:45.84]Shit.
[50:46.78]Okay.
[51:02.01]Hey, the pretty princess.
[51:02.85]I got a lot of money.
[51:07.74]Should I just go get the nun?
[51:11.43]Hey, thank you Fancy Oranges for the sub, and I think I got an earthquake, but thanks guys.
[51:19.04]I could go pick the other thing up.
[51:20.58]I could go get it.
[51:22.68]I'm gonna go get it to make everybody happy.
[51:32.65]What was down here?
[51:34.99]No, forget it.
[51:35.55]I don't want those coins.
[51:41.20]Where is it down there?
[51:43.38]I'm going, I'm going, I'm going, I'm going.
[51:49.67]Do you eat the anchovy with an... Do I eat anchovies on pizza?
[51:52.51]I do not.
[51:55.03]Yeah, I got it.
[51:57.25]It's on.
[51:58.86]Run saved.
[52:05.76]What are my thoughts on Any Birth?
[52:06.90]Plus, I have not played it one time.
[52:12.13]Let's go.
[52:13.79]Blow up some shrooms.
[52:15.69]Sure.
[52:18.73]Bye.
[52:35.09]Can't get these, though.
[52:42.72]The urn.
[52:44.18]What did I do wrong?
[52:45.04]I didn't do anything wrong.
[52:47.62]Play the two-time speed one.
[52:48.60]That's how we end the stream.
[52:59.53]This room sucks.
[53:06.64]Play the movies after this.
[53:08.42]Movies takes a long time to get something going.
[53:11.02]And I want to spread those streams out.
[53:13.83]Because I don't want to just be the same thing over and over again, you know?
[53:16.93]I'd rather do it when I know there's something else I want to do in the game.
[53:21.18]Otherwise, it's just going to be like a bunch of gorillas crashing cars, like, over and over again.
[53:30.59]Oh, he died.
[53:31.15]Oh, God.
[53:41.93]Bombs are key.
[53:45.00]I'll hold on to that for a little while.
[53:46.22]Hey, look at a curse room.
[53:46.94]I can go in here.
[53:47.48]Wow.
[53:50.23]You bet it's not guppy.
[53:55.49]I don't think we would mind that.
[53:59.91]That's what we want.
[54:01.29]That's what we want.
[54:03.87]As long as it's not Skate.
[54:07.51]One of these days, guys.
[54:09.81]One of these days, I'm going to load up Skate 3.
[54:13.43]Holy shit.
[54:15.81]I was gonna play Skate 3 for like four hours and be terrible at it.
[54:18.88]By the way, I'm kind of invincible right now.
[54:26.76]Which is great.
[54:28.04]Because I can kind of just chill and talk to you guys in chat and not even worry about getting hit because I won't take any damage.
[54:33.25]Because I have an invincible broken run right now, especially if I touch another piece of guppy and then it's just over after that.
[54:39.53]And we can just relax.
[54:44.53]Can you get over here, please?
[54:49.46]Yeah, the magic show was the first thing I did.
[54:52.36]And it was fucking awful.
[54:54.27]No, it wasn't.
[54:54.91]It was a couple of great tricks I did.
[54:59.13]Did you see the one with the glass bottle and the wine bottle?
[55:03.35]See the two quarters coming out of the penny?
[55:07.29]That was... Like David Blaine doesn't have shit on me, guys.
[55:13.18]Actually, he like private messaged me.
[55:14.48]He was like, hey, I just want to say something.
[55:17.66]Don't fucking do that trick ever again.
[55:19.38]That's my trick.
[55:24.87]Oh boy, this is great.
[55:28.81]Now I can run away from people.
[55:30.17]Wait, what?
[55:31.71]Hold on, what clip is this?
[55:32.97]I want to see what this clip is.
[55:37.01]I mean, I would open it, but it's a mystery box, so I don't want to potentially fuck this up.
[55:41.52]This is a shot of vodka.
[55:42.98]You can see inside.
[55:43.96]I'm going to place it in the box very, very easily.
[55:46.24]You can see the little clip inside.
[55:48.54]No big deal.
[55:49.84]It's just in the box, right?
[55:52.40]And with a tap of the wrist... Wow, what a fucking idiot.
[55:59.99]Wow, you really messed that one up, Jeremy.
[56:08.60]How'd that trick even work?
[56:09.54]I don't even fucking know.
[56:11.15]Clip it quick.
[56:11.79]No, we're not doing that.
[56:12.61]I'm not doing that right now.
[56:15.63]We're not doing that.
[56:16.47]I'm not doing another clip stream.

[56:49.60]Don't open the box.
[56:50.18]You can like see inside.
[56:51.34]Don't open the mystery box.
[56:52.78]Very, very easily.
[56:53.54]You can see like the little clip.
[56:54.86]You're gonna drop the glass.
[56:55.84]No big deal.
[56:57.14]It's just in the box, right?
[56:58.60]You're gonna drop it.
[56:59.70]And with a tap of the... Oh god, that wasn't even the right one.
[57:03.54]I'm getting hit.
[57:07.96]That wasn't even the right one.
[57:09.16]That one didn't even have the glass dropping.
[57:11.50]That one didn't even have the glass dropping.
[57:14.61]That was...
[57:16.06]I'm not going to open it.
[57:17.50]Oh, god damn it, am I?
[57:18.58]Yeah, I am.
[57:19.06]No, I don't want to do this again.
[57:22.87]Boy, this is great.
[57:25.01]Oh, boy, this is great.
[57:26.61]Now I can run away from people.
[57:27.87]Oh, boy, this is great.
[57:30.00]What clip is this?
[57:30.96]I want to see what this clip is.
[57:32.24]Oh.
[57:35.06]I mean, I would open it, but it's a mystery box, so I don't want to potentially f*** this up.
[57:40.37]This is a shot of vodka.
[57:41.13]Don't open the box.
[57:41.85]You can, like, see inside.
[57:43.61]Don't open the mystery box.
[57:44.89]Very, very easily.
[57:45.51]You can see, like, the little clip inside.
[57:47.41]You're gonna drop the glass.
[57:48.37]No big deal.
[57:49.09]Why is this lagging?
[57:49.75]It's just... I'm not going to open it.
[57:52.17]Oh, God.
[57:53.68]No, that doesn't... It doesn't even have the glass dropping.
[57:58.96]No, this doesn't even work.
[58:00.10]This is not even the right one.
[58:04.42]Look at this shit.
[58:05.08]I'm unkillable.
[58:07.24]Nobody can hurt me now.
[58:08.86]I might as well just fucking walk around.
[58:10.08]Just walk into people.
[58:13.33]I missed a coin.
[58:13.99]I was too busy looking at the mystery box.
[58:20.39]Don't open it.
[58:21.23]Don't open it.
[58:26.93]Yeah, you gotta have like the glass hitting.
[58:31.44]This one doesn't have the glass hitting.
[58:32.44]I guarantee it.
[58:33.82]What clip is this?
[58:34.78]I wanna see what this clip is.
[58:38.87]I mean, I would f***ing open it, but it's a mystery box, so I don't wanna... ...potentially fuck this up.
[58:43.87]This is a shot of vodka. You can like see the little clip inside. No big deal, it's just-
[58:54.87]I'm not going to open it. I'm done. I'm not clicking any more. No more fucking mystery box.
[59:07.93]The audio keeps, like, cutting out, too.
[59:11.11]Alright, what is this clip?
[59:13.77]Wait, what?
[59:16.39]I mean, I would open it, but it's a mystery box.
[59:18.37]This is just the same one.
[59:19.95]You just linked the original one.
[59:20.97]This is a shot of vodka.
[59:22.71]It's going right in the box.
[59:23.45]I'm going to place it in the box very, very easily, very carefully.
[59:26.84]Oh, watch out.
[59:27.50]Don't drop it.
[59:28.02]No big deal.
[59:29.20]It's just in the box, right?
[59:31.76]And with a tap of the wrist...
[59:37.51]That was really loud.
[59:43.19]The mystery box.
[59:43.73]That was a pre-recorded stream.
[59:59.44]Here's something I'll promise you guys.
[60:01.52]One of these days...
[60:04.09]I'm going to just start a stream.
[60:08.46]Do something that's, like, clippable.
[60:12.86]And then we're going to, for the next, like, 30 minutes, we're going to do clips on clips and see what happens.
[60:23.39]Jeremiah, I have the riff for you.
[60:24.85]I'm still perfecting your solo, though.
[60:26.41]Hope you like it.
[60:26.95]Are you serious?
[60:27.67]Let's listen to it.
[60:29.93]Dude, this guy made a custom guitar riff for me.
[60:32.91]Thanks for the 16 bucks, dude.
[60:34.03]Let's hear it.
[60:34.47]You ready?
[60:36.11]Custom guitar riff.
[60:42.91]Nice.
[60:43.21]Is that just the Pac-Man theme song?
[60:52.32]Thanks, dude.
[60:54.78]That's a pretty sick guitar riff.
[60:57.28]Somebody clip that.
[61:02.22]Where am I going?
[61:03.32]Should I take... No, the tower is just bombs.
[61:04.88]I'm gonna go this way.
[61:07.28]Let's see what this... Let's listen to this one.
[61:18.98]We're going to do clips on clips and see what happens.
[61:21.66]No, that's not it.
[61:23.44]Jeremiah, I have the riff for you.
[61:24.90]I'm still perfecting your solo, though.
[61:26.46]Hope you like it.
[61:27.00]Are you serious?
[61:27.72]Let's listen to it.
[61:29.63]Let's hear it.
[61:30.01]Dude, this guy like made a custom guitar riff for me.
[61:32.92]Thanks for the 16 bucks, dude.
[61:34.08]Let's hear it.
[61:34.60]You ready?
[61:35.14]I'm ready to hear it.
[61:36.18]Custom guitar riff.
[61:41.48]Nice.
[61:42.98]Nice.
[61:43.68]I like that one.
[61:44.56]Let's hear it.
[61:45.06]You ready?
[61:46.71]Custom guitar riff.
[61:47.81]Let's hear it.
[61:51.75]You ready?
[61:53.07]Custom guitar riff.
[61:55.71]Jeremiah, I have the riff for you.
[62:05.24]Thanks for the 16 bucks, dude.
[62:06.32]Let's hear it.
[62:06.82]You ready?
[62:07.86]Somebody clip that.
[62:08.46]Custom guitar riff.
[62:09.44]Get out of here.
[62:19.97]Somebody fucking just like... How have I not died?
[62:23.21]I don't understand.
[62:28.46]This is hell.
[62:34.86]No, no, alright.
[62:35.86]For real though, for real.
[62:36.98]We're done.
[62:37.92]No more of this shit.
[62:39.40]No more of this shit.
[62:47.35]I took damage.
[62:48.55]Once.
[62:49.99]Twice.
[62:50.33]Holy shit, man.
[62:52.11]Are you kidding me?
[62:54.09]Alright, let's go.
[63:00.48]No, because somebody linked a different clip and I just blew everybody's eardrums out.
[63:04.48]I'm so sorry.
[63:18.51]Will he walk over that and hurt him?
[63:20.14]I don't think so.
[63:20.64]He's flying.
[63:21.72]I'm going to throw up.
[63:30.31]Sorry for giving you a headache from laughing.
[63:31.99]I'm sorry, dude.
[63:33.75]I was not expecting me to click a random clip and it'd have to be like 5,000 clips on top of each other.
[63:38.44]Ooh.
[63:40.60]Alright, finally I get some tears.
[63:43.48]Ooh.
[63:45.12]No, I ain't clicking it.
[63:46.00]No way.
[63:47.24]Promise.
[63:48.50]Come on, shoot it.
[63:52.34]Do it.
[63:58.76]Do it.
[64:04.74]I will get hit by it if he does it.
[64:12.63]Didn't get hit by it.
[64:18.41]But, honest to God, I thank you.
[64:19.57]That was a pretty cool guitar riff, man.
[64:22.75]Oh!
[64:24.14]Oh, boy.
[64:24.84]We won the game.
[64:26.36]The game is over.
[64:29.04]The game is over.
[64:30.82]Without a doubt, in my mind.
[64:32.22]It's over.
[64:34.42]How much is The Binding of Isaac it is?
[64:36.20]I think it's like 10 bucks.
[64:38.57]Maybe like 20 bucks, 25 for everything.
[64:40.75]All the expansions and everything.
[64:42.67]Something like that.
[64:43.19]Let's go in the coin room.
[64:45.19]See what's in there.
[64:54.87]Krampus is lame.
[64:56.89]Well, he kills bosses in one second, so.
[65:01.44]Get the steam sail.
[65:04.15]Although, that's not really going to matter, is it?
[65:13.25]Yeah, he did the Pac-Man.
[65:14.37]He was playing it on his guitar.
[65:20.15]Thank you, Lord of the Fatties, for the bits.
[65:22.59]Jerma, I was going to spend this on ibuprofen to fix the headache from laughter and blaring clip sounds, but I'll just suffer through it so you can have it.
[65:29.70]Thanks, dude.
[65:30.12]Thank you, Pug Ninja, by the way, for the new sub.
[65:32.86]I'm Mr. Pinky for 10 months.
[65:35.36]Thank you, guys.
[65:37.18]And thank you, Zanpop, for the bits as well.
[65:41.05]Should I get the steam seal?
[65:42.35]Yeah.
[65:44.33]Let's get them both.
[65:45.55]Why not?
[65:50.14]Steam sail, and then get the map.
[65:52.32]Treasure map.
[65:54.36]And you know what?
[65:54.78]Get this, too.
[65:57.48]Yeah.
[65:57.94]That's good.
[66:00.55]Give me my sub back, Nerdquake.
[66:02.07]Oh, I don't know if I can do it.
[66:05.03]I think it's final.
[66:05.77]I'm sorry.
[66:09.85]I missed the secret room, but doesn't the treasure map show the secret room?
[66:12.11]I thought the treasure map was supposed to show where the secret room is.
[66:19.13]Well, it's obviously, like, over here.
[66:26.69]No?
[66:28.78]What?
[66:32.06]I don't know.
[66:32.42]I always thought it was... Oh, the compass does that.
[66:35.26]What does the treasure map do, then?
[66:36.76]Treasure map just shows where everything is.
[66:38.07]Do you have a scam subs?
[66:42.17]What are you talking about?
[66:47.92]Do not scam anyone.
[66:54.88]What a novice.
[67:00.82]Oh, it's the blue map that shows the secrets.
[67:02.20]Okay, well, whatever.
[67:04.56]I don't give a shit.
[67:05.10]I have a lot of good stuff.
[67:05.86]Who cares?
[67:06.18]Let's just go.
[67:07.20]What did I do?
[67:09.42]Who did I scam?
[67:09.98]What did I do?
[67:12.32]What happened?
[67:15.61]Fake magic?
[67:20.81]I don't understand what I did.
[67:24.28]I got scammed?
[67:24.90]Who got scammed?
[67:27.24]What are you guys on about?
[67:29.58]I didn't scam anybody.
[67:35.58]Scam.
[67:36.86]Get me out of this room quick.
[67:38.24]I'm not going that way.
[67:45.33]Holy shit, that's a lot of money.
[67:50.45]I don't want to go in there.
[67:51.55]Give me a curse room.
[67:55.76]Well, that opens up every door.
[67:56.82]What do the purple things do?
[67:58.54]If I blow them up, do they do something?
[68:00.12]I don't know.
[68:05.58]Yeah.
[68:06.78]Look at all this health.
[68:07.60]Holy crap.
[68:11.57]The one thing that I... Here's the thing about this run, where it could go really horribly wrong.
[68:17.03]I have so much health and so much damage reduction and invulnerability, but no damage.
[68:22.26]I'm going to have to deliberately take a bunch of damage at the higher bosses.
[68:25.22]Otherwise, I won't be able to even kill them.
[68:29.70]Well, I do have... But Krampus is based off your damage, right?
[68:32.08]Scales off your damage.
[68:32.84]Okay.
[68:38.57]I can't even... Can I even get this?
[68:41.39]I don't think I can even get that.
[68:49.50]I'm gonna get caught by the IRS.
[68:54.29]Uh-oh, scary.
[69:12.16]Your cat just threw up?
[69:13.06]Well, I'm sorry about that.
[69:13.90]Hopefully your cat feels better.
[69:23.52]Oh, there's another clip.
[69:27.11]Not touching it.
[69:27.71]This is a dangerous one.
[69:37.01]It's so dark.
[69:38.01]I hate when they get this dark.
[69:40.32]Oh, shit, I took damage.
[69:42.14]Oh, boy.
[69:43.40]Okay, we're gonna clean this up a little bit, guys.
[69:51.10]Where's this other heart?
[69:52.62]The map is blocking it, of course.
[69:55.58]Get the fuck out of the way.
[69:56.86]I can't even see it.
[69:58.34]Oh, I'm so angry.
[69:59.32]Okay, well, there's the boss.
[70:08.02]Make sure I don't miss stuff.
[70:16.41]It's actually not terrible that I did that because now at least I have some damage up.
[70:27.21]I'm not going to click any clips.
[70:32.23]Angry streamer.
[70:35.96]What is going on in chat right now?
[70:38.50]Have you guys lost your damn mind?
[70:40.04]What?
[70:44.06]Oh.
[70:45.14]Go down.
[71:02.19]Ooh, the bone guy almost got me.
[71:08.96]What is the eye?
[71:10.68]Poison shots.
[71:14.18]I think I want that.
[71:14.86]We're getting to this point where the items aren't really that big of a deal for me anymore.
[71:18.28]And this room is going to be awful.
[71:28.45]Hi.
[71:28.73]Hi.
[71:33.22]Hey, you're not supposed to turn around that fast.
[71:42.27]Follow me down here.
[71:45.03]Aye, aye, aye.
[71:47.05]I'm a pain in the ass.
[71:50.18]It's just spaced so perfectly, isn't it?
[71:55.75]I was about to just Krampus right there because I just didn't give a shit.
[72:00.06]But, you know, you can't do that.
[72:02.34]Play the movies.
[72:05.72]Oh.
[72:09.04]Eight hour movie stream?
[72:10.32]I'm not doing an eight hour movie stream.
[72:20.00]I honestly wasn't even looking.
[72:21.50]I didn't even see that guy on the right.
[72:30.82]Nowhere to go.
[72:41.16]Wish I could see.
[72:41.90]That'd be great.
[72:49.94]The bean.
[72:50.58]Cool.
[72:53.55]Goodbye.
[73:00.80]What the fuck are you guys talking about?
[73:03.58]You guys have gone crazy.
[73:05.56]You know what started this whole thing?
[73:06.90]The clips.
[73:08.50]I know how to make you guys go nuts.
[73:11.42]I think I found the secret recipe.
[73:13.97]Play a bunch of clips in a row and chat goes fucking nuts.
[73:19.61]What is that?
[73:22.41]Forget me not.
[73:24.77]Well, I'm gonna look up.
[73:25.71]I have no idea what that is.
[73:26.95]Is that a new item?
[73:29.80]Antibirth, maybe?
[73:35.77]What's it called?
[73:36.11]Meiosis?
[73:39.01]Pickups left on current floor will appear in the starting room of the next floor.
[73:45.95]Huh.
[73:47.69]Is that even worth having?
[73:53.63]That's a good... Should I just keep it or what?
[73:59.87]It's not hard to drive.
[74:00.65]It's insane.
[74:04.49]Thank you, Sam.
[74:05.05]Sorry, Jerma.
[74:05.61]I'm the one that linked the sorcery clip.
[74:07.13]Apocalypse, but I couldn't resist.
[74:08.53]It's alright, dude.
[74:12.63]Just use it?
[74:14.01]Yeah, I mean, the poison shots really aren't that great.
[74:17.25]Not gonna do anything for me.
[74:18.13]Alright, where have I not gone?
[74:25.87]It's taking so long to get to mom just because I keep pausing and talking and shit.
[74:30.97]You never lose items anymore.
[74:32.15]Oh, that's good.
[74:34.04]Take it, you meemer.
[74:36.66]Meemer?
[74:39.02]What did I do?
[74:39.52]I'm a meemer now?
[74:42.90]Whatever.
[74:43.20]Let's just go.
[74:48.10]Let's just go.
[74:49.30]Let's go kill the boss.
[74:52.04]Instantly.
[74:52.54]I want to make sure people know that I'm going to get hit here.
[74:58.37]I lied.
[75:07.29]I almost missed everything.
[75:26.19]+2 hearts, jeez.
[75:27.65]And an angel room.
[75:29.67]Oh god.
[75:33.63]I am fucking strong now.
[75:35.59]I am a strong man.
[75:41.17]What did I do?
[75:42.45]I can't even pick this up.
[75:47.89]I have too many hearts.
[75:54.32]Let's go.
[75:59.72]Blow him up.
[76:02.04]Fine.
[76:02.62]We'll fight the angel.
[76:12.78]I need two pieces of the key, right?
[76:14.10]To get to Mega Satan.
[76:15.36]This is only gonna give me one piece.
[76:33.09]I'll watch the whole thing if you do an eight-hour movie stream.
[76:40.71]There's all the items.
[76:41.51]Oh, that's so cool.
[76:46.13]Listen to me, I'm listening.
[76:47.65]What is it?
[76:51.81]What is it?
[76:53.84]What am I listening for?
[77:02.60]Well, I fucked that up.
[77:05.38]What?
[77:08.34]Unnecessary.
[77:10.60]What the fuck is that?
[77:11.98]Wealth of power, electric penny.
[77:15.25]Wikipedia, please.
[77:16.58]Tell me what that means.
[77:26.23]This is a new item from Inantibirth.
[77:28.77]Every time you pick up a coin, you have a small chance to gain one bar of charge on your active item.
[77:52.37]I mean, it's just a chance, or... I don't know.
[77:54.97]Eh.
[77:57.89]Hmm.
[77:58.41]It's alright, but being able to have all these pickup items spawn in case I need hearts... I'm gonna keep the other one.
[78:06.76]Still cool, though.
[78:07.24]That's a new item in the mod.
[78:11.18]Invisible dudes.
[78:14.26]I didn't even know there was another one.
[78:25.08]Flower streamer.
[78:25.82]And there's an arcade.
[78:27.58]Here's what I'll do.
[78:32.46]I'll come back and charge that after.
[78:39.16]Flower isn't damaged?
[78:40.00]No, but it gives you the... Next time you go to a new floor.
[78:46.76]I will donate $100 if I do an 8-hour movie stream.
[78:50.90]You can keep your money.
[78:51.72]I'm not going to be doing money.
[78:59.49]Shit!
[79:00.60]And there it goes.
[79:03.62]I want to get the extra damage.
[79:07.32]I can overcharge with that machine?
[79:08.76]Really?
[79:11.06]Wait.
[79:14.18]Huh?
[79:15.52]Did somebody just swindle me?
[79:16.80]I think I just got swindled.
[79:17.66]I don't want that.
[79:25.45]I'm gonna leave that here.
[79:30.63]I'm going to use the Krampus and then charge this up.
[79:33.49]After I beat the... Actually, can I even do that?
[79:36.33]Swindled again!
[79:37.19]Yeah, that's the story of my life.
[79:38.55]Die, please.
[79:55.20]Fate.
[79:56.66]And now I can fly.
[79:59.32]All is right in the world.
[80:07.48]I should have killed these things way long ago.
[80:16.09]Shit.
[80:17.55]Bastard.
[80:19.63]Bombs are key.
[80:23.67]My little unicorn.
[80:25.37]Temporary badass.
[80:27.41]I like Krampus better.
[80:34.44]And I don't even know what any of this shit is.
[80:35.94]Well... Whatever.
[80:39.62]Voodoo Pin.
[80:43.40]What does the Voodoo Pin do?
[80:45.50]I wonder.
[80:49.69]Voodoo Pin.
[80:50.91]It is an Antibirth item.
[80:53.77]New item.
[80:55.09]Upon use, this item hurts Isaac without actually taking health away, allowing you to activate any items which trigger when taking damage without losing health.
[81:03.47]Well, that sounds like something I fucking want on Samson.
[81:07.57]Bad.
[81:09.39]Are you shitting me right now?
[81:16.90]Oh, boy.
[81:17.36]Okay, yeah.
[81:20.92]I think we're sticking with this.
[81:24.36]And I'm just gonna use it every other room.
[81:27.44]We win.
[81:30.22]Krampus, you're cool, but... Are you cool?
[81:32.46]Ugh.
[81:36.11]That's so good on Samson, but Krampus is so... Krampus is so good.
[81:41.25]Isn't Krampus so good, though?
[81:42.43]What would you guys do?
[81:51.99]Krampus?
[81:53.57]Or... Damn.
[81:57.65]That's fucking crazy, dude.
[82:01.89]How much higher can this go?
[82:06.47]If I go use the charge-up station... Temporary... That's a unicorn.
[82:12.61]No.
[82:12.95]We're going to keep the radish.
[82:17.82]Can I just kill the boss in one hit?
[82:25.14]Um... I'm curious.
[82:32.04]What the hell?
[82:36.12]What?
[82:40.18]What?
[82:41.09]What is going on here?
[82:43.47]It's not doing anything anymore.
[82:44.37]I'm at the max.
[82:49.53]I'm at the max.
[82:54.86]Well, let's go kill the boss.
[82:59.30]You guys keep scamming me.
[83:01.00]You guys call me the scammer.
[83:03.60]It's the other way around.
[83:06.92]Overcharged?
[83:08.24]I guess, yeah.
[83:12.94]How many times can you overcharge it, though?
[83:16.98]Only once or more than once?
[83:18.22]Is that something I don't know?
[83:24.21]Oh, what am I doing?
[83:24.87]I have flight, you fucking idiot.
[83:27.89]You big dummy.
[83:35.29]I forgot I had flight.
[83:36.41]What the fuck is going on here?
[83:46.35]What?
[83:49.03]Alright, apparently there's this over here.
[83:50.53]Hey, there's a curse room too.
[84:03.08]Yuppie.
[84:05.24]No.
[84:08.47]HP up and luck down.
[84:09.71]I have so much HP up.
[84:13.11]It's kind of ridiculous.
[84:14.07]I wish I had more shot speed, though, or more tears.
[84:28.74]My critical thinking skills, yeah, they're off the charts.
[84:34.55]Use the pin, I'm at the max that I can be at.
[84:41.50]I don't think I can get any higher.
[84:49.58]The pin, if I use it, it's not going to do anything.
[84:54.51]Okay, let me use the pin.
[84:56.55]Look, see?
[84:56.93]It didn't do anything.
[85:00.01]See, I know what's going on here, chat.
[85:03.65]You guys trying to make me do things that aren't what I need to be doing?
[85:07.87]Come on.
[85:08.21]There's no max damage?
[85:11.33]Well, how come it's not showing on the left?
[85:12.45]You guys wanted me to turn that on so bad.
[85:15.79]Why is it lying to me?
[85:30.95]Swindled.
[85:31.55]Scam.
[85:33.35]Stop scamming me!
[85:38.54]Alright, did I miss anything down here?
[85:40.98]I think I did, yeah.
[85:44.26]Go get Krampus?
[85:44.94]No, because this resets on the next floor.
[85:47.26]And I want to use it.
[85:47.86]Okay, pick that up.
[85:56.87]Let's go.
[85:57.77]Fuck it.
[86:03.86]Gold chest.
[86:04.26]I got it.
[86:04.60]I got it.
[86:05.86]Don't leave Krampus.
[86:09.66]Oh, blue rock.
[86:10.50]Look out for the blue rock.
[86:13.42]I have to keep the pin.
[86:15.51]Guys.
[86:40.41]I'm not shooting fast enough, man.
[86:41.93]This is not so good.
[86:42.81]I don't know.
[86:53.81]I don't know.
[86:54.73]Maybe this wasn't a good idea.
[86:55.79]Maybe Krampus would have, like, killed her instantly.
[86:57.68]Krampus would have killed her almost instantly.
[87:02.12]This might have been a bad... This might have been a mistake.
[87:27.45]It's taking too long.
[87:28.29]I'm not going to be able to do this.
[87:29.47]I don't like this.
[87:35.08]The negative.
[87:36.36]Oh, fuck.
[87:41.03]Well, I can at least get the key.
[87:43.35]Tears up.
[87:43.95]Thank God.
[87:59.84]I need more tears up, man.
[88:01.08]It's not good.
[88:04.46]Shit.
[88:05.80]Alright, don't blow this.
[88:21.66]Big fat mistake.
[88:22.78]I know.
[88:23.06]That's all I can do.
[88:34.17]Let's go.
[88:37.47]Don't blow this.
[88:38.39]Look at all this shit.
[88:45.48]That's awesome.
[88:45.98]Two of spades.
[88:46.52]What does it do?
[88:46.96]Who cares?
[88:49.32]Bombs are key.
[88:50.26]It doesn't matter.
[88:52.68]I can come back to this room, though.
[88:54.15]That's the good thing.
[89:04.55]God damn it.
[89:05.13]Holy shit.
[89:05.89]I have no damage.
[89:06.79]I need this so badly.
[89:13.72]Hit F7.
[89:14.86]Why is it not working?
[89:20.23]There you go.
[89:26.23]I'm taking it off in two seconds though because I don't like it on the screen.
[89:46.85]It's just me and you, mother brain.
[89:57.22]Chocolate bar?
[89:57.98]What does the chocolate bar even do?
[90:00.58]Mysterious candy, I forget.
[90:03.36]Delete system 32.
[90:04.22]I don't want to.
[90:07.97]Chocolate bar.
[90:08.73]It doesn't do something with, like, shit.
[90:19.72]What does this even do?
[90:20.44]It's not even here.
[90:21.15]I can't look it up.
[90:23.37]The heck?
[90:25.05]It's garbage.
[90:26.35]Well, this thing's better anyways, so fuck it.
[90:30.11]I don't think it's to the right.
[90:31.97]Although it could be.
[90:32.67]We'll find out, right?
[90:34.13]It's not.
[90:34.41]I need guppy.
[90:47.12]That's not guppy.
[90:52.87]Ooh, pride!
[91:07.96]Shot speed down.
[91:08.90]Don't want that shit.
[91:09.90]Alright.
[91:11.42]That sucks too.
[91:12.32]I don't want it.
[91:21.48]You never understood why people get frustrated watching a streamer until you watched me play Isaac.
[91:25.68]Well, alright, I'm gonna be real with you.
[91:29.74]If you are like a Binding of Isaac streamer, and you're a person that watches a lot of Isaac streams, guys that play that have potentially thousands of hours in these games, I mean, I really don't know what to tell you.
[91:43.98]I have like maybe like 60 hours total in this game.
[91:48.97]I obviously don't know what everything does and where everything is, and I'm gonna make mistakes.
[91:52.35]That's gonna happen.
[91:55.31]So sorry.
[92:02.40]So, favorite color?
[92:03.12]Blue.
[92:03.64]Teal.
[92:07.80]This guy has enough to get to my age.
[92:09.90]When we get to my age, then I'm done.
[92:12.14]26. 26.
[92:18.69]Yeah, I'm 29, so that's fine.
[92:26.71]Rock no.
[92:30.85]Didn't learn the game in 60 hours.
[92:33.18]There's like a new expansion once like every year that's added to this game that adds like fucking hundreds of new things.
[92:40.96]You're lucky I even know how to play the fucking game.
[92:43.22]You guys are lucky that I even know what A, X, Y, and B does.
[92:49.06]Alright, give me Guppy.
[92:50.68]And let me just instantly win the whole game.
[92:54.10]That's not Guppy.
[92:57.54]Oh.
[93:01.35]Thank God there's hearts over there.
[93:06.61]Thank God I have a heart room.
[93:10.13]Heart room's up there, right?
[93:17.51]Controller boy?
[93:18.79]Of course you can play this on a controller.
[93:23.35]Pranked.
[93:32.62]That's new.
[93:36.08]I've never seen that.
[93:37.44]Alright, well, I think it's time.
[93:52.67]Saved!
[93:55.78]Let's go!
[93:56.34]The cage!
[94:05.34]Whoa, easy!
[94:09.74]Well, I can fly, so this way it is much easier.
[94:14.76]Much easier.
[94:15.04]But he can land over here, apparently.
[94:17.86]Somehow.
[94:18.26]Fucking turkeys.
[94:20.42]Will one of you die already?
[94:32.81]God damn it.
[94:33.37]What am I doing?
[94:35.08]Thank god.
[94:35.50]One of them's dead.
[94:36.18]Fine.
[94:53.69]Dead.
[94:54.43]Alright.
[94:57.63]Speed and shot speed up.
[95:00.27]And another faith room.
[95:05.69]What happens if I do this again?
[95:09.19]Don't lose the white heart?
[95:10.05]I won't.
[95:14.53]If I do this again, is it even going to do anything?
[95:18.45]Has he realized what the white heart does?
[95:19.62]Yeah, it recharges.
[95:23.25]I know what that does.
[95:28.45]Best cave match I've seen in a while.
[95:29.89]Does it actually do anything?
[95:30.73]I don't think I've ever tried this.
[95:32.26]It's pointless.
[95:33.16]Fucking no.
[95:33.88]Let's get out of here.
[95:36.24]I think I'm good to go.
[95:37.02]Yeah, let's just go.
[95:39.82]Let's kill, it lives, and then... Okay, so this is very, very, very important.
[95:48.43]Since I have the negative...
[95:51.78]I have to go down, right?
[95:52.88]If you have the negative, you go down to Satan.
[95:55.46]Right?
[95:56.32]Am I understanding that correctly?
[96:02.36]Jeez.
[96:06.34]What do I do with the negative?
[96:07.86]I don't remember.
[96:15.13]Yeah, you go down.
[96:15.73]Okay.
[96:17.61]Go where you belong to hell.
[96:23.71]Empty rooms.
[96:24.31]I've seen that a couple of times.
[96:26.71]Is that just an issue with this mod?
[96:31.05]Because I've seen like quite a handful of empty rooms in ATW.
[96:34.99]I wonder if it's like a bug with the mod.
[96:48.95]That's new.
[97:10.36]Mouse on screen.
[97:11.72]I got you taken care of.
[97:12.66]Hey, Stormy True, thanks for the sub.
[97:13.90]David.
[97:16.17]Sojinu, thanks for the 10 months.
[97:18.79]Thank you, Squeak, for the 200 bits.
[97:20.87]Sup, Dad?
[97:21.37]Hey, what's going on, son?
[97:26.51]Move the mouse.
[97:27.15]Move the mouse.
[97:37.14]Pin.
[97:37.90]I'm using the pin.
[97:39.04]Yeah.
[97:42.78]Alright, I'm done with you.
[97:49.78]We're gonna get to my age.
[97:51.91]Alright, 39.
[97:52.97]That's how old I am.
[97:58.15]It's probably all the way down left.
[98:08.08]Jesus, how much money you can give me?
[98:24.09]Hey, easiest enemies in the whole game.
[98:25.67]Nice to see you.
[98:26.39]I'm going to get to like 100 bucks.
[98:41.04]Getting there.
[98:48.68]I hate these things.
[98:50.36]Ah, he just got sucked into my body.
[98:56.43]This music is so good.
[98:57.23]This is all for Antibirth.
[98:59.37]The whole new soundtrack.
[99:00.21]It actually is very good.
[99:09.04]The guy that did the music did a very good job.
[99:13.43]Keeps the essence of the original.
[99:17.23]But it's its own thing.
[99:30.34]Range up, shot speed down.
[99:33.96]Range up, luck up.
[99:35.30]Okay.
[99:37.47]Bombs are key.
[99:39.91]Useless.
[99:41.85]Alright.
[99:43.07]Anything else?
[99:44.07]Because then this is it.
[99:46.75]I'm going down to hell.
[99:47.59]Should I go do something?
[99:51.94]No.
[99:53.86]No.
[99:54.52]Actually, I'm -2 luck.
[99:58.96]Luck down.
[99:59.78]Luck down.
[100:00.45]Luck down.
[100:00.83]I want one more charge.
[100:16.64]People are saying this is better than the new expansion, the official one.
[100:18.97]I think it is.
[100:20.53]Just according to what I've seen people say.
[100:22.35]Let's do it!
[100:24.91]It lives!
[100:35.01]Really?
[100:52.63]Not doing damage to this shit.
[100:54.41]I hate this.
[101:05.43]It's not enough damage!
[101:07.53]How am I ever gonna beat Mega Satan?
[101:13.04]Hold on.
[101:13.72]There was a bunch of, like, spirit hearts up here.
[101:15.96]Wasn't there?
[101:25.04]Wasn't there one or two spirit hearts?
[101:35.67]Guess not.
[101:37.37]No, down here.
[101:37.87]There we go.
[101:43.45]Got him.
[101:45.56]That's it.
[101:52.42]Ah, I could've just gone down.
[101:54.76]You get the hearts on- Yeah, I guess.
[101:55.93]Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.
[102:00.19]Oh, wrong room!
[102:02.57]I was just reading chat!
[102:04.13]My eyes weren't even on the- Sh- Ah, don't get hit.
[102:13.19]God, you fucking annoying little shit.
[102:18.98]My eyes weren't even on the screen.
[102:31.98]Alright, going down.
[102:37.04]Time to go to hell.
[102:38.13]Let's go, Satan!
[102:39.31]There's all my stuff.
[102:42.51]Oh, and I got cursed to the lost.
[102:43.79]Okay, remember.
[102:44.53]I'm going down first.
[102:54.52]This sucks.
[102:55.54]Holy shit, this sucks.
[102:57.24]I keep multiplying.
[103:01.76]God damn it.
[103:03.68]Oh my god.
[103:04.82]Easy.
[103:05.32]Hold on.
[103:05.70]Slow down.
[103:06.28]Slow down.
[103:06.80]Slow down.
[103:07.16]Before I lose my fucking mind.
[103:11.86]Ah.
[103:12.58]Almost lost my mind.
[103:13.44]Okay.
[103:13.72]I went.
[103:13.94]Okay.
[103:14.54]I'm going down.
[103:20.31]That means I have to go up, up.
[103:47.39]Isaac.
[103:54.68]The Empress.
[103:55.45]Isn't that just... I don't know.
[103:56.51]Okay, we're going right.
[103:57.57]So we gotta go left, up, up.
[104:00.29]Oh, fuck.
[104:28.08]We're good.
[104:28.42]We're good.
[104:28.76]We're good.
[104:29.06]Good.
[104:29.26]Hold on.
[104:29.48]Left.
[104:30.60]Up.
[104:30.90]Up.
[104:41.01]Down.
[104:41.39]Down.
[104:41.77]Right.
[104:42.03]Okay.
[104:43.89]Right.
[105:05.97]Palms are key again.
[105:06.89]Great.
[105:07.09]Okay, now it's left.
[105:10.53]Left, up, up from here.
[105:15.09]What are these things?
[105:26.72]Take the card.
[105:27.32]I will, I will, I will, I will.
[105:33.88]I'm not going to leave the Empress.
[105:35.08]No.
[105:42.95]Down, down.
[105:55.95]Play my summer car.
[105:59.33]Oh.
[106:05.55]Okay, what else do these things do?
[106:06.85]I can get them all.
[106:10.76]Temporary damage up.
[106:11.78]It's the Book of Belial.
[106:15.88]I... The book of secrets.
[106:24.23]Keep the radish.
[106:24.87]Did I just open another one?
[106:31.47]I opened up two.
[106:33.17]I'm not paying any attention.
[106:34.35]I'm just like slamming into walls and shit.
[106:44.70]I'm keeping the radish.
[106:48.72]I have 16.
[106:49.83]Who cares?
[106:50.51]Oh, thanks for the pair.
[106:57.05]Do this.
[107:02.32]Look at Belial.
[107:07.32]Look at the seven on it.
[107:10.94]Somebody just wrote, get that.
[107:15.30]Book of Belial will say... Yeah.
[107:21.05]Yeah.
[107:29.85]Fuck you guys!
[107:30.59]Alright, left, right?
[107:58.04]Too many charges.
[107:58.92]Belial.
[108:02.86]Keep Belial, right?
[108:09.23]No.
[108:11.21]I think I'm going to keep the pen.
[108:14.79]Keeping the pen.
[108:17.02]You guys can say what you want, but it's... Yeah, I need the pin, for sure.
[108:23.14]Without question.
[108:26.67]If I don't have the pin next floor, then the game's gonna be over.
[108:29.53]I'm not gonna be able to hurt you.
[108:32.69]Alright, it's time to kill Satan!
[108:35.75]What does the Empress do?
[108:46.04]Hey, thank you, Piggums, for the sub.
[108:48.32]The kills cast.
[108:49.34]Thanks as well.
[108:50.91]Stormy Chew.
[108:51.91]Thanks.
[108:52.99]Thanks for the bits, Turbo Jim.
[108:55.37]Don't let chat pay attention.
[109:02.43]Increase damage directly.
[109:03.46]Damage buff for room.
[109:05.98]I thought I can't leave this room, can I?
[109:09.28]Go use the sacrifice room.
[109:13.01]Empress is just the Eve.
[109:14.15]Save Empress for Mega Satan.
[109:17.45]Okay.
[109:17.75]Let's just do it.
[109:18.29]Let's go.
[109:18.71]Fuck it.
[109:18.97]I'm done.
[109:19.45]Let's move.
[109:20.88]Go.
[109:22.66]Satan!
[109:25.64]By fire, be purged!
[109:27.02]That's what he says.
[109:28.96]Shit.
[110:04.88]Here comes the hooves!
[110:17.67]I'm freaking out.
[110:18.59]I'm messing up.
[110:20.83]I can't see the ground!
[110:21.73]There's too much shit on the ground.
[110:24.98]I'm ruining this with my fucking stupid spit that I'm putting on the ground.
[110:33.06]Damn.
[110:35.34]Hold on.
[110:35.74]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[110:39.10]What was it?
[110:41.34]Hey, what was it?
[110:41.86]What was it?
[110:42.39]It was left?
[110:45.53]To go to where all those are.
[110:46.65]Left, left, up?
[110:49.93]I don't know.
[110:51.77]Yep, left.
[110:53.39]Up.
[110:57.42]Up.
[110:59.24]Okay, here we go.
[111:04.28]Let's go.
[111:05.04]Down.
[111:06.44]Down.
[111:07.66]The flower!
[111:15.03]I keep fucking forgetting that it exists.
[111:22.25]Let's go.
[111:23.79]God damn it.
[111:26.46]Fuck me, man.
[111:30.82]I'm not an idiot.
[111:34.15]Hey!
[111:34.37]Alright.
[111:40.09]Mega Satan?
[111:40.63]Should I try to beat Mega Satan and get embarrassed?
[111:42.57]Why is there nothing?
[111:44.19]Thanks.
[111:44.43]Thanks for nothing.
[111:49.63]Alright.
[111:49.89]Well, it's time to lose.
[111:53.01]Time to lose to Mega Satan.
[111:59.54]Thankfully, I have complete damage up.
[112:03.23]Be sure to get your damage.
[112:05.24]I mean, won't the emperors just do that?
[112:10.74]When I go in the room and I use the car, won't that bring me up to... Just charge it.
[112:16.53]Try to beat a couple of rooms.
[112:19.03]Don't go straight to it.
[112:20.17]Get your damage up.
[112:20.89]Alright, let's do it.
[112:34.76]Cool?
[112:35.18]What do you mean cool?
[112:42.29]You have the habit?
[112:43.11]Go power up.
[112:52.90]Habit's gonna charge the pins, it doesn't even matter.
[113:00.85]So wait, I just can fight Mega Satan and just keep charging it, I guess?
[113:06.43]I'm, like, so scared to go in here.
[113:08.42]Everyone's gonna freak out if I go in here.
[113:12.18]See, when I play Isaac by... Here's the thing.
[113:13.68]When I play Isaac by myself, I just do whatever the dumb shit I do, and I'm just like, oh, whatever, I did that.
[113:19.41]I'm so scared to do anything because people are gonna be like, you fucking idiot.
[113:45.62]Mmm, wish one of you would die.
[113:47.20]Dude, it'll be funny.
[113:55.72]You know what, here's the thing though.
[114:10.44]I could just beat the shit out of myself right now.
[114:14.22]I think I'm gonna do that.
[114:17.24]Yeah, so the guys... Here, listen, listen, listen.
[114:20.63]There's one, two, three, four.
[114:21.83]There's four hearts here.
[114:22.73]Four hearts.
[114:24.73]There's four and a half hearts.
[114:26.29]What if I just go smash into an enemy fucking four times?
[114:28.42]Who cares?
[114:29.18]Then we can do it.
[114:32.84]That's what I'm gonna do.
[114:34.14]You might call me stupid.
[114:35.43]Good.
[115:15.78]I think I did it.
[115:17.92]What is that?
[115:19.62]Ghost baby.
[115:20.22]Oh, good.
[115:20.68]I have a ghost baby now.
[115:23.16]Alright, we're good.
[115:23.70]We're good.
[115:24.02]We're good.
[115:24.30]It's time to go.
[115:25.90]I've done it.
[115:31.31]Bombs are key.
[115:31.93]That doesn't matter.
[115:32.55]Who cares?
[115:34.13]I have the empress.
[115:36.77]I'm amazed you have the slightest idea of what to do.
[115:40.48]Let's go die to Mega Satan.
[115:42.46]Good luck.
[115:42.76]3, 2, 1.
[115:44.00]Here we go.
[115:50.09]What?
[115:50.33]Who's... BabyRage?
[115:53.57]Go for Guppy.
[115:54.63]Mega Satan!
[115:58.07]Alright, I'm gonna be quiet.
[116:09.77]Do you kill his hands first?
[116:31.12]Doesn't matter.
[117:58.28]One hand down!
[119:33.73]Die!
[119:47.81]Fuck you, Satan!
[119:51.65]Calm down.
[119:56.89]Wow!
[119:59.55]I did it.
[120:03.26]No, I didn't.
[120:04.86]I fucked it up!
[120:05.70]Shh!
[120:09.66]Yeah.
[120:51.45]Die!
[120:59.57]Woo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo-hoo!
[121:02.69]I did it, he's dead, I win.
[121:22.04]Aw, you fucking idiot!
[121:31.59]Gave your license, granted.
[121:32.75]I got it back.
[121:41.72]Hey, he did it!
[121:43.78]You unlocked a secret exit.
[121:45.20]What?
[121:47.42]Secret exit?
[121:51.41]Is that part of the mod?
[121:59.58]That must be part of the mod.
[122:00.36]Because, I mean, I have, like, a save file.
[122:06.32]I wonder what that means.
[122:10.08]Antibirth content unlocked!
[122:12.03]Apparently.
[122:13.29]Who knows how to get there?
[122:14.35]I have no clue.
[122:20.61]Go to the secret exit.
[122:23.43]Oh, you got the good shit now.
[122:31.59]Exit the game.
[122:37.09]Hey, thanks YellerBelly for the 10 bucks.
[122:40.45]It's simple, you'll find it.
[122:45.50]Where is it?
[122:47.34]It's three new floors now?
[122:51.69]You did it!
[122:52.09]Uh, thank you, ya boy, Wilson, for the new sub.
[122:56.99]And spanking bread.
[122:58.16]And dipu shite.
[122:59.86]Deep, deep you shite.
[123:01.26]Whatever that means.
[123:03.04]And then, SNVWVW, thanks for four months.
[123:11.04]One shriek now at -2.
[123:13.52]Are you as tall as everyone says you are?
[123:16.00]No, I'm, uh, Quara, thanks for three months, but I, no, I'm, I'm, like, five-eighth.
[123:21.96]You need a key on the first floor, so save one.
[123:29.26]Whatever, let's just play my buddy Kane.
[123:36.71]Store keys on the first floor.
[123:37.93]Now you guys have to guide me through here.
[123:41.31]I'm sorry, I was looking at chat.
[123:52.84]This game sucks.
[123:55.03]Spiny Basic doesn't suck.
[124:06.95]There's 5-7 on the patch notes video.
[124:10.60]Reset.
[124:13.32]Did I beat the Nameless King?
[124:14.42]I did beat the Nameless King on Dark Souls.
[124:20.00]I did.
[124:20.90]On that sorcery character as well.
[124:29.54]It's okay, Jerma.
[124:32.45]I like them short.
[124:36.03]Whatever you say.
[124:38.11]Ah, I gotta stop reading.
[124:39.39]Fucking start over.
[124:41.75]Seriously.
[124:47.06]One key for the first door, two bombs for the second, two soul hearts for the third.
[124:55.15]Don't hate the game, hate the player.
[124:58.71]Um, hold on.
[125:00.67]So I needed one key, then I need two bombs, and then I need soul hearts.
[125:09.86]Yeah, I beat Dark Souls 3 days after, like two days after it released.
[125:14.52]On stream.
[125:15.54]With a bunch of pressure.
[125:16.42]And, hey, guess who, you guys can vouch for this, guess who beat Champion Gundyr?
[125:23.27]First try.
[125:25.81]This guy.
[125:27.00]This guy did.
[125:29.30]Champion Gunder.
[125:30.54]First try.
[125:31.90]Who also beat... I didn't know what he did.
[125:34.80]Fucking game came out two days ago.
[125:36.38]There's no Wikipedia page.
[125:40.86]Oh, and the Dancer of the Boreal Valley.
[125:42.98]First try.
[125:43.78]Called it like fucking Babe Ruth.
[125:45.24]This guy did.
[125:45.74]I need to... I'm gonna pay attention.
[125:52.59]Time to pay attention.
[126:01.18]I drained all my fluids.
[126:03.35]Beating Mega Satan.
[126:04.31]That I can't even play anymore.
[126:05.73]Okay, cool.
[126:18.35]Alright, so what were you guys talking about?
[126:19.75]That I need certain items for certain floors?
[126:25.06]Hit by a spider.
[126:26.06]Hell of a... Book of Despair.
[126:28.62]Temporary tears up.
[126:31.53]Okay.
[126:36.40]Curve Torn is amazing.
[126:37.38]I'm gonna die here.
[126:42.26]No, now I'm not.
[126:42.90]Now I'm going to live.
[126:52.81]Well, there's a bunch of bombs.
[126:53.69]I got my bombs.
[126:56.35]So you can unlock the doors.
[127:03.52]Take our fluids.
[127:05.70]Thank you, Coolio, for the six months.
[127:08.48]Kendalio for the new sub.
[127:09.72]Exua for the new sub.
[127:14.12]Alright, so let me understand this.
[127:16.42]Is there going to be a door after I beat the first boss that needs a key?
[127:19.92]I don't want Bob's head.
[127:28.41]One key to two soul hearts.
[127:30.11]How am I going to get two soul hearts on the third floor?
[127:38.17]Wow, that's an awesome item.
[127:44.62]Oh, there it is.
[127:45.26]Okay.
[127:47.56]So, here we go.
[127:48.66]This is the door, right?
[127:53.50]Okay.
[127:55.36]Let's go.
[127:58.18]We're going to... Downpour 1.
[128:09.20]Blue rock?
[128:09.76]Ah, fuck.
[128:11.74]I fucked it up.
[128:15.54]We can get back here really easily, though.
[128:17.96]Oh my lord.
[128:21.60]What is coming after me?
[128:22.62]What the fuck is in here?
[128:28.92]These are all new enemies.
[128:30.40]Brand new.
[128:38.03]the reflections in the water are what's killing me right now.
[128:42.67]I have plenty of bombs.
[128:46.92]Alright, look at him.
[128:48.02]Is that a blue rock?
[128:50.46]Guys, is that a blue rock?
[128:55.10]Wait, what?
[128:57.32]Jesus.
[129:00.61]Oh!
[129:06.18]Alright, well, there's all brand new content.
[129:08.78]Let's get back there again.
[129:10.30]There's the key.
[129:24.87]That's very easy to get to, so I'm not concerned about it.
[129:40.88]Obvious.
[129:42.26]Angry, oblivious streamer misses blue rock and dies.
[129:44.56]He did.
[129:45.64]Are there any rocks in here?
[129:54.33]Hey, come on.
[129:54.63]That's all things I've never seen before.
[129:56.91]It's scary.
[130:00.81]This is kind of an annoying room.
[130:28.40]No blue rock.
[130:32.16]Angry streamer refuses to go in the item room.
[130:34.00]No, I'm going.
[130:35.02]I'm going.
[130:36.74]There's lard in here.
[130:39.08]Perfect.
[130:44.60]I'm not going to skip the item room.
[130:48.32]Why would I skip the item room?
[130:52.19]I have like 71 hours in this game.
[130:54.01]You don't think I know what to do?
[130:54.93]What do you think, I'm an idiot?
[130:56.87]You guys think I'm stupid?
[130:59.93]Don't answer that.
[131:02.23]Don't answer that question.
[131:05.57]You're all going into timeout.
[131:08.05]Timeout.
[131:17.26]Isn't there something we're doing?
[131:18.08]Isn't one of the challenges a no item run?
[131:21.91]Or you only get like one or starting items or something.
[131:25.85]Something like that.
[131:26.46]Alright, I got the key.
[131:36.40]I have the bombs.
[131:37.20]I need the soul hearts.
[131:38.04]Are there any rocks?
[131:38.90]Help me out here, guys.
[131:40.66]I don't think I see any.
[131:45.89]Not here.
[131:51.32]What's with the emotes?
[131:55.40]Emote spam.
[131:58.46]Nothing in here.
[132:01.40]No.
[132:02.26]I need spirit hearts, so I can't screw it up.
[132:06.18]No.
[132:12.25]No.
[132:15.23]No.
[132:15.75]Oh, well.
[132:16.69]Let's go.
[132:18.11]Is somebody just telling me to play Minecraft?
[132:28.97]Remember, you're not an idiot.
[132:29.79]Hey, thanks, man.
[132:30.69]I appreciate that, sir.
[132:36.29]I'm looking at chat.
[132:37.69]Stop looking at the chat when you fight a boss.
[132:41.47]Stop doing that.
[132:42.49]You're going to get in a lot of trouble.
[132:44.01]What's with my voice?
[132:44.71]Why am I doing that with my voice?
[132:45.67]I feel like I was just selling something.
[133:08.12]I just looked again.
[133:12.11]Charm is telling himself off.
[133:13.83]I just get so easily distracted.
[133:15.49]I'm like, oh, what's people saying?
[133:16.53]Let me see what the conversation says.
[133:17.91]Don't do it.
[133:18.99]I had a boss.
[133:22.51]It'll... Give me a fucking break.
[133:30.97]I swear to God.
[133:31.94]Ugh.
[133:41.33]I'm gonna, like, minimize the chat.
[133:47.91]What?
[134:02.96]What do I want?
[134:07.54]Billy Mays here!
[134:08.49]Are you tired of reading chat at a boss?
[134:12.88]The spoon is just homing, but I'm taking the little guy.
[134:16.64]Bloodsucker.
[134:20.52]Blue rock.
[134:21.26]There we go.
[134:22.68]There's a rock.
[134:26.58]Speaking of rock, damage up.
[134:28.52]Alright.
[134:29.32]The world is no longer ending.
[134:35.10]Whoa.
[134:35.94]Easy, buddy.
[134:41.13]Bleach heals.
[134:41.69]Yeah, definitely.
[134:44.62]Um, I need two bombs before this is over, though.
[134:51.16]What the hell do these guys do?
[134:54.33]Why does that look like a frog person?
[134:59.75]What the fuck?
[135:00.43]Just rains?
[135:08.62]Just gotta keep them in there!
[135:14.15]I don't like this feeling that every single enemy, I don't know what they are or what they're doing.
[135:23.97]I also don't like how the tears are the same color as mine.
[135:40.06]That's going to freak me out.
[135:51.68]Get him, buddy!
[135:52.24]Alright, good.
[135:59.97]Shit, this is not good.
[136:07.49]I need spirit hearts, though.
[136:09.83]I have the two bombs, but I need hearts.
[136:11.75]Let's go look around one more time.
[136:21.74]Wait, what?
[136:24.14]Hmm.
[136:31.82]There's a person in the water?
[136:37.85]There's a guy underwater.
[136:38.71]I still have another floor.
[136:42.55]Yeah, that's true.
[136:45.57]Jesus.
[136:48.68]I'm gonna need the hearts that I just screwed up.
[136:51.64]I could go buy one.
[137:01.29]Should I go- should I buy spirit hearts or no?
[137:04.07]I'm sure I can buy one.
[137:05.11]Use a reflection.
[137:13.64]Bombs is third floor, hearts is fifth floor.
[137:15.76]Oh, okay.
[137:19.04]This is all news to me.
[137:20.04]I don't know what this is.
[137:21.56]Stop getting hit.
[137:23.55]Well, it's hard to not get hit when this is the first time you've ever seen these enemies.
[137:28.31]And every room is new enemies.
[137:30.95]Sorry.
[137:34.25]Still missing any rocks.
[137:41.03]Not yet.
[137:41.36]Venom snake.
[137:44.68]Venom snake.
[137:48.28]Just go kill the boss and see what happens.
[137:51.78]Wormwood.
[137:55.40]What the fuck are you?
[137:56.36]It's like an actually difficult version of the pinhead thing.
[138:16.31]Damn.
[138:18.28]Ah, that sucks.
[138:23.22]Oh my god, that sucks.
[138:28.88]What the fuck is going on?
[138:30.85]Oh!
[138:35.63]Oh my god.
[138:43.66]Now I need to heal.
[138:44.26]There's hearts down here, isn't there?
[138:55.08]That was intense.
[138:55.94]He, like, came through the wall.
[138:56.90]That was cool.
[139:10.69]Should I go in?
[139:12.11]Or not?
[139:13.64]No.
[139:14.58]Fuck it.
[139:17.28]This mod is completely free.
[139:18.48]Yes, it is.
[139:20.64]Antibirth is a mod of rebirth.
[139:24.58]So as long as you have rebirth, this mod is completely free and it adds like 100 new items, new stuff like this, completely new bosses, new content.
[139:36.81]Antibirth.
[139:39.85]Is the suggestion don't fuck it up?
[139:40.97]I'm going to try.
[139:57.37]Down for two.
[139:59.13]Game room.
[140:03.29]I can always come back down.
[140:04.17]And that's great.
[140:09.87]A nickel.
[140:17.09]What hit me?
[140:18.44]One of those little worms?
[140:32.55]No.
[140:35.37]Give me a spirit heart.
[140:36.01]Come on.
[140:38.93]That, I can re-roll items, right?
[140:46.11]I'm taking the one on the left.
[140:47.13]The one on the right sucks, but what does this one do?
[140:53.16]There's a knife piece on this floor?
[141:00.40]Re-roll into something else.
[141:06.31]That rerolls your whole run.
[141:07.51]Well, maybe I just... Don't accidentally do it, right?
[141:18.38]That guy threw a bucket at me.
[141:27.62]PhD.
[141:31.02]Nothing in here is really worth taking.
[141:35.37]Should I take the treasure map?
[141:38.28]Maybe.
[141:41.86]Use it now?
[141:42.52]Why would I use it now?
[141:44.06]I have a decent setup at the moment.
[141:48.00]Here's my items.
[141:48.50]You want me to use it now?
[141:49.16]I have a bunch of health up and stuff.
[141:53.31]Wouldn't that be detrimental to... I would lose my regen.
[141:57.21]I have a good high health, high regen build right now.
[142:00.91]I don't want to lose it.
[142:21.87]Yeah, I'm going to keep the bombs for sure.
[142:29.68]Use it.
[142:30.18]Use it.
[142:30.40]You won't get rid of the health.
[142:32.52]It'll get rid of my little friend, though.
[142:35.98]And look out.
[142:36.50]Whoa!
[142:38.48]Slow down.
[142:40.28]They just keep getting the buckets and whipping them at me.
[142:43.46]And now there's like little landmine bugs.
[142:46.79]What on Earth?
[143:04.22]He will betray you.
[143:05.38]He's not going to betray me.
[143:06.34]He's my best friend.
[143:07.08]What's in this room?
[143:12.04]Nothing?
[143:12.30]I guess there's nothing in here.
[143:17.00]Hold on, wait.
[143:19.36]What is in here?
[143:24.02]Anybody catch what's going on in here?
[143:29.03]On the mini-map.
[143:29.53]Look at the mini-map.
[143:30.27]What is that supposed to mean?
[143:32.85]You want me to do it?
[143:37.96]Did it.
[143:39.98]You fucking liars.
[143:43.58]You guys lied to me.
[143:47.16]Now what?
[143:48.38]Now what the fuck am I going to do?
[144:02.99]Ooh, what's that?
[144:04.91]Knife piece.
[144:10.92]I'm never going to listen to the chat ever again.
[144:17.34]Knife piece.
[144:18.36]Does that hurt me?
[144:19.14]No.
[144:20.74]Look at this trash build now.
[144:24.32]This build is terrible.
[144:29.76]The room has a chest in it.
[144:32.00]I just got... There's three chests in here?
[144:39.70]Or there's three totals.
[144:42.68]I love you, but you gotta stop listening to chat, man.
[144:45.62]Thank you, Dive Meals.
[144:47.12]Re-roll again.
[144:47.90]I probably will.
[145:01.12]Okay, don't get hit.
[145:03.06]Stay alive.
[145:06.16]Take Bob's head.
[145:08.88]Well, what if I don't want Bob's head?
[145:10.16]What if I want to re-roll?
[145:11.64]Actually, I'm gonna keep this shit.
[145:12.84]Bob's head is good for damage.
[145:24.30]These new flies.
[145:26.16]You suck.
[145:29.29]I need two bombs, but give me another soul heart.
[145:32.33]Shit.
[145:32.67]Come on.
[145:34.35]Soul heart.
[145:40.14]Game room.
[145:48.58]Reroll.
[145:49.31]I don't need to reroll.
[145:51.69]I'll be fine.
[146:08.06]I love this.
[146:08.52]This music is much better than the other one.
[146:10.88]And there's more bombs.
[146:14.92]Double zero.
[146:17.85]No, I'm not going to recharge and re-roll.
[146:40.57]Actually, yeah, don't reroll or use bombs because you'll fuck up the expansion stuff.
[146:45.41]Wait, what?
[146:55.04]You're gonna fuck up the expansion.
[147:01.29]Come on, bullshit.
[147:03.27]Cane for crying out loud.
[147:06.77]Doesn't Kayn have like a 60% chance to win this shit?
[147:10.67]Oh my fucking god, get me out of here.
[147:14.39]What a crock of shit.
[147:15.11]I'm gonna blow up this.
[147:22.58]Well... Nevermind!
[147:28.26]Will this make you feel better about your role?
[147:29.78]Well thank you Jethro.
[147:30.88]It does.
[147:33.33]Thank you.
[147:36.21]Let's just go.
[147:36.69]I'm not doing another re-roll.
[147:44.42]Let's just try to get through some of this content.
[148:09.35]Alright.
[148:11.93]Evil range and shot speed up.
[148:13.53]Okay.
[148:14.57]We've got a devil room.
[148:15.47]We've got the bomb room.
[148:16.69]Let's just see what's in the devil room.
[148:18.03]Fun.
[148:21.25]There's my spirit hearts, guys.
[148:25.43]There it is.
[148:25.81]I am gonna have spirit hearts.
[148:37.11]Re-roll again on no balls?
[148:38.28]No fucking way.
[148:43.15]Guppy's paw.
[148:48.38]We're good.
[148:52.36]Now I just don't get hit.
[148:53.90]Don't lose.
[149:01.66]Take it, take it, take it, take it, take it.
[149:04.26]I did.
[149:04.98]I just want to get there.
[149:10.10]Reroll till full guppy.
[149:15.18]I mean I guess I could if only you didn't re-roll think about it guys remember when you guys told me to re-roll and I had like five hearts I would have had a full thing of spirit hearts
[149:44.38]Yeah, one of my keys will disappear.
[149:46.88]I'm just going.
[149:47.40]Fuck it.
[149:47.74]No.
[149:48.62]Just stay alive.
[149:49.66]Don't get hit.
[149:54.48]Keep going.
[149:58.17]I'm not going to lose the knife.
[150:00.47]Look, I'm going to be happy if I don't die.
[150:03.73]Trying to learn these new enemies is bad for me.
[150:05.89]I'm going to lose.
[150:06.39]Going down.
[150:13.63]Mine's won.
[150:17.94]Whoa, this is what I'm talking about.
[150:19.80]This is what I'm talking about.
[150:22.58]What is going on?
[150:24.78]What is happening?
[150:28.58]This is what I fucking was talking about.
[150:31.10]What the fuck was that shit?
[150:34.98]Oh, God.
[150:39.59]I got sucked into the corner and
[150:44.30]Oh, god damn it!
[150:45.73]The shit I was talking about... And hey, guess what?
[150:54.11]Left was right, right was left, up was down, down was up.
[151:00.36]That was horrible.
[151:07.92]Get a glow ring.
[151:11.65]And I don't even need to go this way.
[151:13.30]Son of a gun.
[151:15.46]Oh, this sucks.
[151:18.62]Those stupid bats pulled me in the corner and then made me like a moron and I couldn't move.
[151:28.01]All new enemies too.
[151:28.79]It's gonna be over.
[151:42.17]The stars.
[151:45.13]I so desperately need a free roll.
[151:49.01]Not at this point.
[151:50.81]Stars takes me to the item room, right?
[152:00.65]Alright, good.
[152:01.63]Good to know.
[152:02.05]They explode and turn into fire.
[152:03.99]Got it.
[152:16.53]I'm so scared of this shit.
[152:17.49]I'm so terrified of you guys.
[152:21.47]If I step on the lava, it's going to hurt me, isn't it?
[152:25.73]Oh my lord!
[152:28.53]Free cars for a mile.
[152:29.35]I'll go back to it.
[152:35.67]God damn it.
[152:40.06]What is this?
[152:50.16]Huh?
[152:52.72]Okay, there's no, like, cart here.
[152:57.88]Punching bag.
[153:08.23]Use the paw.
[153:11.05]I know.
[153:22.52]This reroll sucked.
[153:43.61]They're actually on the cards now.
[153:46.23]Oh shit!
[153:47.33]In my fucking pants!
[153:49.36]God!
[153:53.30]Does a cart have to be killed too?
[154:04.15]Believe in yourself.
[154:04.99]I just need to not get hit.
[154:12.54]What is that weird mushroom?
[154:14.00]Blow it up.
[154:17.40]Spirit heart.
[154:19.81]What's in there?
[154:21.32]What's in there?
[154:24.00]Oh, thank God.
[154:25.34]The dream is still alive, guys.
[154:28.58]The dream is alive.
[154:29.28]We're okay.
[154:31.41]We are still kicking.
[154:54.45]This is slightly annoying.
[155:03.15]Fuck it, right?
[155:03.63]Let's just go.
[155:08.23]There's also a rock in the long room.
[155:10.75]Was there really?
[155:13.55]Make sure I get it.
[155:17.29]Where is it?
[155:18.83]Where is this rock you speak of?
[155:24.51]In that room or in this other one back here?
[155:39.67]Where is it?
[155:47.55]I don't see it.
[155:50.64]Look for the X.
[155:54.66]50 rocks lining the walls.
[155:59.74]I'm so ner- Guys, I'm so nervous right now.
[156:06.64]I, like, don't wanna, like, have to lose here.
[156:09.25]Wait, it wasn't that one?
[156:20.53]Yo, open your eyes.
[156:27.03]I'm talking about this one right here.
[156:28.09]Yeah, well, there it is.
[156:34.19]Cool.
[156:39.80]Let's go fight the boss.
[156:42.96]Hopefully it's not a stupid, dumb, idiot boss.
[156:46.28]A curse room.
[156:48.68]Yeah, I'll go in the curse room.
[156:56.71]I have to lose?
[156:57.43]No, I don't want to lose.
[156:58.19]Why would I want to lose?
[156:59.57]Oh, that was great.
[157:16.35]I'm really glad that there was nothing in here worth taking.
[157:18.75]It was just spiders.
[157:23.33]Do I need to wait?
[157:24.65]Ungrateful streamer.
[157:25.63]Oh, it's like a good idea.
[157:26.51]Yeah, I haven't done it in a little bit.
[157:29.57]I've not checked out cheers or bits.
[157:31.53]Uh, Jethro, thanks for the five bucks.
[157:33.31]They made you re-roll your good build.
[157:35.28]Chat sucks, chat sucks.
[157:39.26]Uh... Thanks, Jethro.
[157:44.16]Thank you, MadVillain for the bit.
[157:45.10]GummyMonk for the 500 bits.
[157:46.48]It says cheer, cheer, cheer, cheer.
[157:49.74]Rewind to flanker.
[157:52.01]Your Friday streams are the only ones I get to see on PC, says somebody else.
[157:55.11]I can't see their name.
[157:57.86]But thanks for the five bucks.
[157:58.64]Do I get to see a PC down here in Australia?
[158:00.62]So I'm going to give you more bits now to make up for it.
[158:03.88]Well, thanks a lot, dude.
[158:07.58]Yeah, and subwise, there was Paragon Sheep for five months.
[158:10.55]Blue t-shirt guy.
[158:11.49]Thanks, guys.
[158:13.09]Sdogman.
[158:15.95]Mr. Bill.
[158:18.11]NekoNation.
[158:21.96]And the Diabeetles.
[158:23.44]Thanks a lot, dude.
[158:26.88]Let's go.
[158:29.53]Alright, so there's like another knife piece somewhere, you guys are saying?
[158:38.85]How much does it cost to view this dream?
[158:40.05]This dream is free.
[158:45.54]Reroll.
[158:47.87]Why does he keep complaining?
[158:48.67]I'm not complaining about the build.
[158:50.59]I'm making a joke.
[158:51.77]I'm just joking.
[158:54.63]Let's go fight the boss.
[159:01.23]The Fallen.
[159:01.77]Alright, I think I know this guy.
[159:30.93]Didn't lose any health.
[159:31.57]Good.
[159:34.25]Gimpy.
[159:34.98]Sweet suffering.
[159:36.18]Okay, good.
[159:39.20]Keep going.
[159:47.82]Mine's two.
[159:49.88]Curse room.
[159:52.88]That's... Okay, great.
[159:55.86]I will take it.
[159:59.55]Hey, thank you.
[159:59.91]A wizard for the bits.
[160:02.16]I've ever played the original Isaac.
[160:03.36]Yeah, oh yeah.
[160:04.56]I've played every single one.
[160:07.13]Every single Isaac that has ever come out.
[160:10.83]Why does it be so dark?
[160:11.79]I don't know what any of these things do.
[160:13.09]Get out of my fucking life.
[160:31.90]Arcade, that's good.
[160:44.55]Wait for you to come to me, I guess.
[160:59.18]I got a lot of health.
[161:05.43]Rocks, rocks, no.
[161:08.03]Knife piece on this floor, alright.
[161:10.64]Let's get it.
[161:28.96]Punching Bag Buddy is actually doing some pretty great things right now.
[161:32.65]If I do say so.
[161:35.70]Detracting the annoying enemies.
[161:37.62]That's good.
[161:38.22]Oh, I have two keys.
[161:47.10]Watch out.
[161:48.74]Watch out.
[161:56.00]Ooh!
[162:08.37]Thank god there is.
[162:12.50]You unlocked Bethany!
[162:14.82]Unlocked challenge number four, Bloody Mary.
[162:16.66]Hey, we got Bethany.
[162:17.73]We unlocked the new character in the expansion.
[162:19.43]Cool!
[162:19.53]Okay.
[162:37.69]What the fuck is this?
[162:38.55]Press all the buttons?
[162:50.70]Huh?
[162:55.14]Okay.
[162:56.72]What?
[163:01.30]Did I do something wrong?
[163:04.06]What?
[163:05.72]What happened?
[163:06.54]What happened?
[163:07.06]What the fuck?
[163:09.41]What, you have to press those buttons in like a very specific order?
[163:11.31]Are you serious?
[163:15.64]How is this... How the fuck was I supposed to know that?
[163:19.48]I had to look at the pebbles.
[163:28.44]What?
[163:33.64]Two... One... Three...
[163:40.49]Well, I had a... Do you see how fucking dark this piece of shit is?
[163:48.91]I, like... Maybe if the brightness was turned up by like fucking 3%, I would have been able to maybe even know that was a possibility.
[163:58.82]We gotta have a fucking dark-ass video game, right?
[164:03.66]The whole thing has to be fucking black.
[164:05.14]Look at this.
[164:06.08]Cool.
[164:09.85]Okay, well... Not getting the other piece of the knife, apparently.
[164:13.97]I do want to look around, though.
[164:31.51]What's over here?
[164:34.48]Oh, shit.
[164:35.48]Meat wheels.
[164:36.26]Wow.
[164:36.86]Okay.
[164:37.04]I don't even know where I am.
[164:38.86]I'm the same person.
[164:40.66]I look exactly the same.
[164:41.74]What the fuck is that?
[164:44.50]Well, now I know.
[164:45.16]That's right.
[164:45.56]Yeah.
[164:45.88]Well, now I know.
[164:47.98]I mean, think about it.
[164:49.58]If I didn't have, like, a group of people here yelling at me of what to do, I would never have done that.
[164:53.88]And I would have been like, oh, shit, I gotta do that next time.
[164:56.92]Stop yelling at me.
[165:01.00]You guys are just yelling at me.
[165:02.16]I'm sorry.
[165:04.06]This is new to me.
[165:04.90]I'm sorry.
[165:09.12]Look, I even got down here in the first place.
[165:27.35]No, that's... What does that regular mushroom do?
[165:33.32]Where's my Wikipedia?
[165:34.18]What's the mushroom do?
[165:38.02]Straight up mushroom.
[165:41.13]Plus one, damage up 50%.
[165:43.19]Okay, I'm taking that.
[165:46.55]It's a magic mushroom.
[165:47.33]I'm taking it.
[165:47.79]Yeah, that thing is incredible.
[165:50.14]Give it to me.
[165:55.00]No contest.
[166:04.52]Beep?
[166:05.44]What do you mean, beep?
[166:06.08]What's the beep?
[166:09.21]Let's go to the boss.
[166:15.75]Make our way through the... dark mines.
[166:23.43]Try opening this.
[166:32.34]Why do I play Isaac?
[166:34.30]Oh, because it's fun.
[166:40.68]Great Gideon.
[166:46.52]Great Gideon.
[166:47.19]Okay.
[166:49.81]Can't seem to hurt the Great Gideon.
[166:55.91]Yes.
[166:57.41]Kill all of his... What is going on?
[167:15.74]I guess I'm sort of confused here.
[167:18.64]How did I hurt him last time?
[167:24.56]Did he open his valve or something?
[167:28.80]Oh, I'm hurting him.
[167:31.19]Okay, well, whatever.
[167:50.47]God damn it.
[167:54.69]What's with the camera, by the way?
[167:55.77]Can the camera move, like, over here?
[168:03.09]This is just... This is confusing the fuck out of me right now.
[168:06.08]Is it to kill the spawns, I guess?
[168:14.10]Like, you see what the camera's doing?
[168:15.34]Like, what the fuck?
[168:17.22]Can the camera, like, stop doing that?
[168:20.53]I want the camera to follow me down.
[168:21.91]Holy shit.
[168:30.85]See how the camera's, like, following me down now?
[168:34.16]I wasn't doing... Like, what the hell?
[168:37.70]Well, there's that mushroom.
[168:38.58]Alright, hold on.
[168:39.22]Let me see something.
[168:43.53]Oh, the blue mushroom!
[168:49.91]Taking it.
[168:57.76]Can I... get over there, please?
[168:59.74]Alright, there's the door.
[169:07.36]Don't accidentally go down.
[169:08.64]That would be bad.
[169:09.82]Okay.
[169:19.70]Nothing?
[169:20.34]Whoa!
[169:20.90]Excuse me!
[169:21.84]Whoa.
[169:28.41]Okay.
[169:29.95]Let's go.
[169:37.94]Almost to the end.
[169:45.20]Should I just take the stars?
[169:47.52]Devil deal?
[169:48.42]No devil deal.
[169:48.96]It would have killed me, wouldn't it?
[169:55.69]The knife piece?
[169:56.15]I thought I blew the knife piece, didn't I?
[169:59.44]knife pieces is not I can't obtain it anymore yeah I already messed the knife up a long time ago oh more buttons I can't even move
[170:35.50]I didn't take the devil deal.
[170:48.43]Well, whatever.
[170:49.39]I didn't want it.
[170:52.11]I didn't want the evil up.
[170:53.35]Too much evil up.
[170:54.05]Is that a good excuse?
[170:56.91]No.
[170:58.68]Still haven't done the stars yet.
[171:00.18]So I'm really... Teleport too?
[171:04.83]What the... I don't like how the fire is... I don't know if it's my fire or not.
[171:22.16]Could do guppy right now, but I'm not gonna.
[171:27.13]Another button.
[171:27.71]What's it do?
[171:31.56]Definitely helpful.
[171:32.78]Yeah.
[171:43.93]Take the bombs.
[171:45.39]Hold on, hold on.
[171:46.33]Wait, wait, wait.
[171:52.61]How did I even see them?
[171:54.99]I seriously did not even fucking see them on my screen.
[172:01.65]Yeah, you wanna see what I have for items?
[172:02.59]Alright, I'm getting the shit off my screen.
[172:07.07]It just distracts me.
[172:07.97]It's a goodbye.
[172:12.08]Too much shit on the sides of my screen.
[172:13.68]I can't even- I can't be a fucking gamer, you know what I mean?
[172:21.74]What?
[172:24.08]Oh, what is going on?
[172:25.28]I have to, like, touch the moon?
[172:44.38]What?
[172:49.00]Okay.
[173:01.01]Only one more floor after this and then I'm like the boss, whatever it is.
[173:09.83]Jerm is abandoning the fans?
[173:11.12]What?
[173:11.68]That's not true.
[173:16.48]I get really, his thing, I get really absent-minded when I play Isaac in stream.
[173:22.23]Because I'll, like, just be talking, or I'll turn and look over here, and, like, read the chat, and be like, oh, yeah, that was cool, I'll go in this room.
[173:28.47]And leave something.
[173:29.01]And he won't even, like, know I did it.
[173:38.17]What is this magic funfetti egg?
[173:43.70]Huh.
[173:56.62]What is that?
[173:59.78]Flight of fate.
[174:00.72]Flight eternal.
[174:02.36]Jawbreaker.
[174:03.00]Don't chew on it.
[174:08.20]I need to look up what that does.
[174:12.11]Jawbreaker.
[174:12.97]This is a new item in Antibirth.
[174:17.99]Tears have a chance to become a tooth dealing more than triple damage.
[174:22.55]So it's just monster's teeth.
[174:24.37]Okay.
[174:24.49]Okay.
[174:30.04]Look how big these fires are, oh my god.
[174:32.86]Why are these fires so huge?
[174:34.71]And another thing, like this is all brand new to me.
[174:45.81]This is like playing a different game.
[174:52.47]So that's like also confusing me.
[174:55.43]And making me lose track.
[175:01.64]I'm going to go back up there and get that.
[175:19.84]I think I'll at least complete the Antibirth content.
[175:25.24]Except for the secret knife shit, which I obviously screwed up.
[175:31.33]Look how huge that is.
[175:32.33]Why is it so big?
[175:36.29]Blocking my view.
[175:39.49]This is not the right way.
[175:51.36]Mouse, mouse, move the mouse.
[175:56.06]So this is just a little extra room to go in, I guess.
[176:02.95]Okay.
[176:09.65]So, just go up?
[176:15.17]I guess we're going up.
[176:18.36]Whoa!
[176:24.36]How did these guys make all this new shit?
[176:28.14]All these new sprites and everything.
[176:29.24]It's just... That's cool.
[176:39.80]I don't want it.
[176:54.17]Rocks?
[176:54.45]No.
[176:55.77]Item room.
[177:01.29]You just got home drunk and it's a good stream already?
[177:03.39]Well, thanks, man.
[177:04.11]Welcome.
[177:06.54]Welcome to the stream.
[177:11.90]That's the buddy, right?
[177:14.51]Hold on.
[177:18.15]What's the leaf do?
[177:20.83]Look it up.
[177:26.44]That is the gnawed leaf.
[177:31.72]Yeah.
[177:32.50]I'm definitely taking the leaf.
[177:36.79]Taking the leaf.
[177:38.21]And just stand still.
[177:42.24]And just never get hurt.
[177:44.64]Fly friend?
[177:45.52]No, it's the leaf.
[177:47.24]It's gotta be the leaf.
[177:50.36]If I just stand still, then I can't be even hurt.
[177:52.44]And I can just stand here and just stare at people and make sure I know what to do.
[177:59.30]I'm gonna be the coward, guys.
[178:00.68]Oh.
[178:09.18]That's not good.
[178:12.38]That's not good.
[178:18.22]That's not good.
[178:23.07]Oh well.
[178:24.97]Now I can reach out.
[178:25.69]I've been able to reach out the whole time.
[178:30.17]Oh well.
[178:42.90]Didn't take fly.
[178:45.22]Whoops.
[178:46.92]Get the pig.
[178:47.42]You want me to get the... What does the pig do?
[178:50.93]Fine.
[178:52.29]My life saving.
[178:53.03]What does the pig do?
[178:57.13]I don't know.
[178:59.31]Who cares?
[179:02.89]Sorry about the mouse.
[179:09.92]Wait.
[179:10.12]What?
[179:10.80]What?
[179:18.45]Don't extinguish any fires on the next floor.
[179:27.94]The rain popped out?
[179:32.48]I'm not gonna put the mouse in the center of the screen.
[179:40.15]There's another huge fire.
[179:58.56]Uh, up.
[180:01.42]Die, magician people.
[180:09.62]Die!
[180:16.79]Little mini people.
[180:18.51]Ah!
[180:20.53]Get out of here.
[180:31.95]Whoa!
[180:34.10]This is terrifying.
[180:44.54]Let's just go.
[180:48.30]The Visage.
[180:50.88]Oh boy.
[180:52.86]Chain?
[180:53.74]Yeah.
[180:54.70]Break the chain.
[180:56.75]Kill the heart.
[181:01.13]I'm assuming they're going to connect again.
[181:10.46]It's not so bad.
[181:14.64]Alright.
[181:20.91]Range up.
[181:26.03]Yeah, run too good to fail.
[181:27.41]Whatever is the boss, I'll probably beat it.
[181:31.12]Let's just keep going.
[181:34.61]Visage?
[181:36.45]The Visage?
[181:37.37]Visage?
[181:37.69]I thought it was Visage.
[181:42.57]Alright, don't extinguish fires when I get to the fire room is what I was told.
[181:48.67]I will keep that in mind.
[181:56.99]Shit.
[181:57.47]How many people in this room?
[182:11.60]There's like a hundred people in here.
[182:20.04]Without the knife, I can't fight the boss.
[182:21.44]How many pieces do I need?
[182:23.33]Can I just do it with two?
[182:24.15]Do I need three pieces?
[182:28.51]What the fuck?
[182:30.75]Oh, that turns you off.
[182:31.97]You can't shoot if you're in there.
[182:49.15]Am I just screwed here?
[182:53.77]Can I just not fight the final boss?
[182:56.68]I assume that's the case.
[183:20.38]Guppy is still going to keep me alive for a long time, so... Blue box with a key in it.
[183:32.88]Let's look it up.
[183:37.04]Um... Blue keyhole box.
[183:41.96]Where are you?
[183:44.02]There it is.
[183:46.36]Pandora's box.
[183:52.42]I mean, I don't... Just... Just take it, right?
[183:59.18]What does it do now?
[184:03.49]A ton of coins.
[184:05.85]Okay.
[184:08.83]You can only use it once.
[184:11.41]Well... That really was like a fucking dork cube.
[184:14.63]That thing is crazy looking.
[184:16.55]I'm just gonna use this too.
[184:21.68]Wait, what?
[184:25.10]The lovers.
[184:27.33]Just hearts.
[184:29.99]A lot of purple in this new expansion.
[184:43.48]Oh, coins.
[184:44.06]I need those.
[184:44.64]Yeah, I do.
[184:45.08]Let me go this way.
[184:54.10]Went a little too fast there.
[184:56.54]And the boss is right here.
[184:57.50]Nice.
[185:02.75]So where's this fire room?
[185:05.05]This is the fire room.
[185:09.33]So don't put out... Don't extinguish any fires.
[185:11.67]So then what?
[185:12.50]What am I supposed to do in here?
[185:28.16]Like a bomb in the middle or something?
[185:41.01]Find the other room.
[185:42.15]Okay.
[186:00.63]That room is annoying.
[186:02.69]Another long room will tell you where it is.
[186:04.67]Okay.
[186:13.86]Let's go find the Burger King long chicken room.
[186:20.94]Down?
[186:22.94]Yeah.
[186:25.38]Yeah.
[186:29.98]Now the build is actually pretty good at this point.
[186:39.07]Mmm, fuck flat one.
[186:43.31]Magic Eraser!
[186:46.03]Magic Eraser!
[186:48.39]That's good, right?
[186:49.11]Should I take it?
[186:51.37]Can I just throw it at the last boss and kill it?
[186:56.96]Stream down?
[186:57.50]What?
[187:04.57]I mean, I already have pretty much full hearts.
[187:06.47]I'm taking it.
[187:10.04]I'm just going to kill the boss in a second.
[187:14.76]Well, first let me just do this.
[187:15.62]Erase all your problems.
[187:32.20]There's another stupid moon thing.
[187:39.46]Hey, look at you.
[187:39.98]You have stuff to give.
[187:45.48]Give me something good before this run is over.
[187:52.69]Well, that's okay.
[187:53.61]That's not great.
[187:58.69]Well...
[188:02.61]HP up.
[188:06.83]What is that thing?
[188:14.96]Like a tremor.
[188:18.18]Balls of steel.
[188:19.30]Doesn't matter.
[188:23.60]Where's the long chicken room?
[188:25.06]Fuck, I'm making myself hungry.
[188:26.40]I need to eat something.
[188:28.72]I can't wait to eat something.
[188:36.60]I barely ever eat fast food, man, but for some reason now I want a long chicken from Burger King.
[188:40.51]Do they have to be in this line of sight to hear them?
[188:51.37]What's going on?
[188:56.57]I'll just go around you, okay?
[189:08.64]I need a long chicken.
[189:09.68]Come on.
[189:10.81]Where is it?
[189:11.17]Get your brain out of the way, dude.
[189:29.22]Oh, I see a long room.
[189:30.68]That might be it.
[189:38.11]Ooh, okay.
[189:39.45]So... Oh, fuck.
[189:44.23]Okay, all the ones in the middle.
[189:45.75]Over here.
[189:46.15]So, the middle eight.
[189:48.93]Middle eight on the left.
[189:50.80]The whole top row on the right.
[189:54.48]And then this one in the bottom left.
[190:00.04]So, everything in the middle except the right eight ones...
[190:05.58]Whole top row, right, down, bottom left.
[190:13.97]Oh, wait.
[190:14.41]Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh.
[190:16.09]Okay.
[190:18.95]Oh, shit.
[190:21.71]So I have to blow out these blank ones then.
[190:25.86]So all the ones that are surrounding in the edges got to go on this one.
[190:32.97]Both ones on top.
[190:35.11]Bottom right.
[190:36.23]All the way to the right.
[190:37.17]And then the middle left ones down here.
[190:40.29]Okay.

[190:43.92]Got it.
[190:46.64]Got it.
[190:49.86]Ready to rock and roll.
[190:51.14]Let's beat The Binding of Isaac.
[190:54.98]Anti-berth.
[191:03.98]Now we go back to up.
[191:05.72]Right, right, right.
[191:10.12]He's going to forget.
[191:11.90]Oh, I think I got it.
[191:12.66]Alright.
[191:17.38]So all the ones around the edges here.
[191:19.04]Including this one.
[191:37.39]And then... I forget.
[191:40.85]The ones up top.
[191:45.77]And then... I know it's this one, right?
[191:58.64]Don't!
[192:00.72]Why did the fire have to come out?
[192:04.26]Hold on, I'm looking at it.
[192:09.28]Oh, I see a long rope.
[192:12.26]Ooh.

[192:19.66]Oh, boy.
[192:20.08]Almost fucking ruined everything.
[192:22.13]Okay.
[192:26.37]It's these.
[192:27.53]One, two, three.
[192:28.41]One, two, three.
[192:30.55]This one.
[192:33.73]And this one.
[192:35.48]Got it.
[192:40.30]Oh man, that was so close.
[192:47.47]Alright, so I have... I can't even do it anyways.
[192:49.29]I have two pieces.
[192:49.95]Oh well.
[192:52.37]Let's go erase the boss.
[192:58.05]Mom!
[192:58.51]He didn't do anything.
[193:05.20]Holy shit, Mom!
[193:06.20]Mom!
[193:20.53]What is happening?
[193:29.24]There's too much fire on the ground I can't even see
[193:44.33]Okay.
[193:46.13]I did it.
[193:49.51]No, I didn't.
[193:49.85]I don't want this shit.
[194:00.98]Alright, we did Satan before.
[194:02.16]Too bad we couldn't see the real true boss.
[194:10.86]Guppy.
[194:13.18]Wait a minute.
[194:15.10]Wait a minute.
[194:21.69]It's guppy.

[194:23.51]It's guppy.
[194:23.97]Well, whatever.
[194:29.67]Left Polaroid, right negative.
[194:31.57]We did the negative last time.
[194:32.60]Let's just get the Polaroid and lose.
[194:35.12]I don't have the paw anymore.
[194:38.92]I don't, but I could.
[194:39.96]Go get it right now, can't I?
[194:42.80]No, I can't.
[194:46.32]Polaroid, fuck it, let's just go.
[194:52.95]I'm done anyways.
[194:54.89]I just wanted to see what that new content was.
[195:04.00]So what is the actual, if you get all three knife pieces, what's the actual boss?
[195:14.61]Oh, you already got credit for it.
[195:15.55]Okay.
[195:15.99]Whatever.
[195:17.71]Whatever.
[195:20.39]That worked.

[198:22.62]Callous.
[198:25.67]Alright, Callous, Little Game Boy, or Jawbreaker.

[201:56.62]Whoops-a-daisy, didn't mean to do that, but you know, who cares?
[201:59.76]This is like the whole Beauty and the Beast cast is in this room.
[202:16.03]And I got the Beast in here.
[202:18.48]There's like fucking plates, there's like Lumiere, the clock lady.
[202:24.45]All the teacups.
[202:25.63]This whole room is beauty and the beast.
[202:34.54]Come on.
[202:45.13]Be their guest.
[203:02.80]Damn it.
[203:04.54]There's a devil heart in there, though.
[203:09.15]I'd be smart to go get it.
[203:13.31]Or stupid, depending on how you see me.
[203:19.97]Power is just bombs.
[203:23.21]Lovers will keep it.
[203:24.16]Where is this heart?
[203:29.02]Yes!
[203:29.56]We got it.
[203:31.82]Another fucking beauty.
[203:50.51]You guys are annoying.
[203:51.73]You guys are super annoying.
[204:06.84]Here we go.
[204:09.18]Isaac!
[204:11.10]Oops.
[204:23.67]What?
[204:24.29]I didn't do that.
[204:35.71]By the way, I just realized something.
[204:40.54]Don't stop talking.
[204:41.30]I'm going to stop talking.
[204:46.18]That's what I realized.
[204:53.44]I'm gonna stand still.
[205:04.99]The way you dodge light shafts blows my mind.
[205:07.29]Well, I forgot that I could stand still, and who cares?
[205:09.25]You don't even dodge them.
[205:19.33]Chest room!
[205:23.98]Alright, this is just damage down to... What the fuck is happening?
[205:32.61]What did I just do?
[205:33.39]What's going on?
[205:34.93]What item did I just pick up to do this?
[205:40.52]This is just nonsense.
[205:43.40]Let me look up the rest of these items.
[205:46.20]Before I fuck up everything.
[205:56.53]Hold on.
[206:01.04]Hold on.
[206:02.28]Ted, run.
[206:05.40]What's the cross do?
[206:10.36]What's that cross do?
[206:15.50]I know epic hack is not good.
[206:17.80]Let me see what the cross does.
[206:22.80]Celtic cross.
[206:23.34]Upon taking damage, you have a chance to gain an invulnerability shield.
[206:26.94]Well, there you go.
[206:28.88]Yeah, give me that.
[206:32.34]Uh, these are just explody bombs.
[206:33.66]And Epikak, I do not touch Epikak, right?
[206:39.55]Just don't even go near Epikak.
[206:50.14]There you go.
[206:53.30]That's chemical peel, not Epikak?
[206:57.19]Oh, damn.
[206:58.65]Oh, alright.
[207:01.23]Okay, we're ready to rock and roll.
[207:06.58]I'm going to die because it's just, I don't know.
[207:08.56]You know what I'm saying?
[207:09.10]Like, there's no way to even tell what the fuck I'm shooting at.
[207:10.90]There's some throwing up into this guy.
[207:18.02]Come on, die.
[207:23.74]What is it?
[207:36.08]It's ruined.
[207:37.38]It's so ruined.
[207:38.31]There's nothing I can do about it.
[207:39.61]Oh well.
[207:52.04]Who is who?
[207:53.48]Whose bullets are whose?
[208:01.70]Aye.
[208:09.44]Aye!
[208:11.22]Ah!
[208:11.72]God damn it, it's over.
[208:16.39]Not quite.
[208:17.23]I gotta get to the boss link right now.
[208:18.95]Otherwise, though... Who made who?
[208:38.31]Because they suck.
[208:46.48]Christ!
[209:19.98]Why did he shoot full?
[209:20.70]That was bullshit.
[209:31.25]Fuck.
[209:34.63]It's over.
[209:44.41]It is so over.
[209:45.49]I needed a boss now.
[210:12.52]What's that?
[210:13.98]Speed down range.
[210:15.98]Range is building.
[210:16.92]What is that?
[210:17.26]I don't know what that means.
[210:19.80]Oh, come on.
[210:23.46]You're killing me, game.
[210:24.40]No, it's not even over here.
[210:35.54]I'm just in the middle of a nightmare.
[210:39.29]Huh?
[210:41.19]Why is that happening?
[210:45.92]What?
[210:47.06]Why did that happen?
[210:55.57]And he takes the torus.
[210:57.27]Oh, this whole run is just a dead run.
[210:59.27]So, who cares?
[211:13.61]What keeps doing that to me?
[211:15.13]That's Taurus?
[211:15.81]This is just silly mode.
[211:26.50]It's silly Isaac.
[211:29.88]I have fought so many rooms.
[211:31.26]This is so dumb.
[211:44.65]It's gotta be right here.
[211:45.45]Please end it.
[211:49.16]End this madness, please.
[211:54.34]End this fucking madness.
[211:59.84]Ram him.

[214:14.46]I think there might be one behind me too.
[214:16.73]I don't know.
[214:17.39]I can't tell.
[214:27.25]There it is.
[214:32.96]I did it!
[214:33.62]I salvaged it.
[214:34.54]Hooray.
[214:37.16]Yeah, Guppy's hairball was hitting him.
[214:39.60]That was fucking awesome.

[215:10.43]Oh, God.
[215:11.35]People are throwing fucking money.
[215:14.29]Even with the missed soul heart.
[215:15.35]I know, right?
[215:18.07]That can't be how it happened.
[215:23.21]Drumalum.
[215:25.49]Drumalum just gave $100.
[215:26.55]And he does not have a message.
[215:31.03]He just says 10,000 bits.
[215:35.41]Thank you so much, Drumalum.
[215:38.29]That's a lot of cash to drop in one sitting.
[215:41.75]So, much love, dude.

[216:34.01]If you missed the... If you missed the magic show and you care about it, it was the first, like, 30 minutes of the stream.
[216:44.34]I just turned around and looked.
[216:47.42]I have a whole fucking room to clean now.
[216:50.46]Goddamn.
[216:52.82]For some reason, it just blew my mind that this was behind me.

[217:28.60]It was alright.
[217:29.18]A lot of them didn't work.
[217:31.02]And I got like... I got like stressed out during one of them, but I couldn't even do it.
[217:39.51]Shout out to the guitar riff.
[217:40.43]Yeah, no, it was fun.
[217:41.09]Tonight was a fun stream.
[217:42.39]I'm glad you guys were around for it.
[217:43.97]I had a lot of fun.
[217:46.96]But that's going to be it.
[217:48.48]Have a good weekend, guys.
[217:49.24]Take care of yourselves.
[217:50.96]I will be back on Tuesday.
[217:55.30]Didn't work, sure.
[217:57.95]I will see you lovely, lovely people on Tuesday.
[218:03.43]And I've got something else planned for Tuesday.
[218:05.39]But that's Binding of Isaac.
[218:06.75]That's Antibirth.
[218:08.55]The free mod.
[218:09.33]Again, it is free.
[218:10.59]If you own The Binding of Isaac: Rebirth, this is a free expansion.
[218:15.91]So...
[218:18.97]Take care, everybody.
[218:20.67]Thank you, Sdogman, for the 800 bits right at the very end.
[218:23.50]You are the best.
[218:24.64]I love you.
[218:25.34]Always be you.
[218:25.98]Well, thank you, dude.
[218:27.50]That's very, very nice of you.

[218:32.60]So, good night.
[218:33.36]Good luck.
[218:33.86]Take care, everybody.
[218:35.26]I'll see you all on Tuesday.
[218:37.64]Unless I decide to do an impromptu stream, which I have some stuff going on this weekend.
[218:41.25]I'm getting together with my friend to do some more writing because we're going to start working on some new main channel stuff.
[218:49.61]So, good night.
[218:51.07]Take care.
[218:52.27]Have a good rest of your evening.
[218:54.07]And I'll see you soon.
[218:57.18]Bye-bye.
[219:05.34]Also, yes, thank you for the 100,000 followers.
[219:09.23]I broke 100,000 followers.
[219:10.41]That's fucking amazing.
[219:11.41]Thank you so much, guys.
[219:13.45]Good night.
[219:19.71]So,
