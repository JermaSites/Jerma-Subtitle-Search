[ve:60.16.100]

[00:31.88]I told you I was going to be precisely on time.
[00:36.48]I said it.
[00:36.80]I said I'm going to be on time today.
[00:39.72]I was 10 seconds early.
[00:42.17]It's on time.
[00:46.43]I don't believe it.
[00:52.52]What's going on?
[01:00.34]Well, this time I'm not on the ground.
[01:04.26]I am seated this time.
[01:06.66]I'm not on the ground.
[01:14.18]I have some changes to my setup.
[01:22.24]I'm very happy with it.
[01:34.38]I had a dream you were playing Tears of the Kingdom.
[01:37.98]Well, that sounds like a nightmare to me.
[01:45.95]Nah, I'm just kidding around.
[01:47.79]We finally made it on time.
[01:57.84]Give me one second.
[01:58.42]I want to just drink.
[02:00.54]Needs a refill.
[02:01.58]I guess I'm... I've been doing this thing.
[02:03.44]I've been doing water, but like 10% watermelon juice.
[02:10.37]It's been pretty great, actually.
[02:12.18]You get a little bit of flavor, but it's not all sugar and bullshit.
[02:15.06]It's been pretty great.
[02:15.66]Give me one second.
[05:39.83]Okay, hi.
[05:41.17]Uh... That was weird.
[05:43.80]I hope that doesn't happen again, otherwise I'm gonna have to figure this out and I'll have to see you another time.
[05:49.40]Okay.
[05:50.50]So let me explain.
[05:52.14]I may have tripped a breaker.
[05:55.64]But it's not, like, I'm just in a different room.
[06:00.35]It's not like I'm doing any more.
[06:01.65]I browned out.
[06:01.99]I had a brownout.
[06:03.05]Okay.
[06:07.86]How did I overload this?
[06:09.83]It's not like I added any equipment.
[06:11.37]What the hell happened?
[06:12.23]Dude, this might happen again.
[06:17.81]I don't know.
[06:18.59]I was using the setup for like a couple of hours yesterday.
[06:22.47]Maybe the streaming is like pulling extra power and tripping the breaker.
[06:29.70]OK, well, everybody cross your fingers that doesn't happen again, but I'm fully prepared if it does.
[06:37.14]In the event it does, I'm going to have to do a little bit of investigating.
[06:45.93]But road to advanced.
[06:49.45]I mean, I'm sitting in a recliner right now.
[06:51.13]I did.
[06:51.57]It's not like I'm streaming from a space station.
[06:57.76]But anyways, hey, it wouldn't be a stream that I do unless something goes horribly wrong for no reason, right?
[07:02.98]I mean, I have to just accept it at this point.
[07:07.66]Hey guys, I changed my whole setup.
[07:09.42]Spent the last, like, few days getting an off setup and all these things.
[07:13.03]I got a recliner now.
[07:14.21]I got this cool custom-made computer setup.
[07:17.93]Oh, oh, oh, wait, you thought I was going to be able to stream.
[07:20.17]Time to brown out my breaker.
[07:28.05]But that's actually, that's really good to know because that means that there's potentially something to do with like the circuit that I'm on.
[07:36.19]Maybe I have to try plugging into a different outlet.
[07:38.28]I don't know.
[07:38.54]I'll have to figure that out.
[07:39.80]Anyways, we'll see if it keeps going.
[07:41.58]If we are fine, we're fine.
[07:42.76]And if not, if the stream turns off again, then hey, it's okay.
[07:47.68]I'll figure it out.
[07:48.16]We'll see you another day.
[07:49.26]But I'm here now.
[07:51.10]And yeah.
[07:56.20]Getting brownouts in your 30s.
[07:59.22]Oh, I see the joke.
[08:00.14]Okay.
[08:00.42]Oh, that's alright.
[08:04.82]Alright, we'll find out.
[08:10.05]I'm actually kind of scared that it's going to happen again.
[08:13.03]But anyways, good to see you.
[08:15.75]Today, we're going to be playing Resident Evil 4 Separate Ways DLC.
[08:20.78]That's the plan.
[08:26.89]Don't jinx it.
[08:28.49]Yeah, I gotta keep my mouth shut about this now.
[08:31.58]But yeah, we're gonna play DLC.
[08:34.20]I'm streaming from a new setup.
[08:35.28]Like you said, I thought you said, like I said.
[08:37.38]I am officially in a recliner.
[08:40.52]I will show you.
[08:41.18]I'll be on cam for a little bit tonight.
[08:44.05]We are playing a scary game.
[08:46.01]Everybody say your prayers that we don't get an electrical brownout again.
[08:50.33]Overloading a circuit.
[08:51.29]Okay, well anyways.
[08:53.95]Yeah, I'm in a recliner.
[08:57.86]This is the new setup.
[09:01.13]Gets me more comfortable.
[09:01.97]I can actually sit back now.
[09:03.27]Because before, I think I mentioned it when I was on the ground.
[09:06.05]Because when I was lying on the ground last stream, I was not even 20% of the way through setting this new setup up.
[09:13.33]But let's take a look.
[09:14.13]You want to see?
[09:15.64]I'll show you.
[09:19.72]There's the game.
[09:22.10]I'm going to hit start game and it's going to draw extra power and it's going to turn the computer off.
[09:26.84]I'm fucking scared to click.
[09:28.12]Yes, let go.
[09:30.77]Oh my God, it scared the shit out of me.
[09:32.01]You can hear it.
[09:33.63]I thought my computer browned out.
[09:34.61]Alright, hold on.
[09:38.35]Here we go.
[09:38.57]Alright, you ready?
[09:39.89]Here we go.
[09:47.46]Recliner.
[09:48.70]I told you I was going to be sitting in a chair.
[09:53.35]I have this over... This is not the final setup, by the way.
[09:55.87]I know a lot of people are like, wow, you're just in a chair this time.
[09:57.69]Look at this Pac-Man over here.
[10:00.50]You got a mustache?
[10:01.12]Yep.
[10:02.62]Well, whatever you could call it.
[10:05.64]No Reddit shelf?
[10:07.22]Hold on.
[10:08.14]Not done yet.
[10:09.47]I'm missing two or three very important pieces.
[10:11.95]But when they get here...
[10:14.27]Oh yeah.
[10:15.63]I've got a few things I really need to get.
[10:18.35]I need a different little table over here.
[10:20.12]I need a whole section.
[10:22.12]I'm not completed yet.
[10:22.88]I still have to go get it.
[10:27.50]Why do I have them?
[10:28.16]Why am I doing umpire Elbertson again?
[10:29.68]There's a reason.
[10:31.62]There's a reason.
[10:33.18]No, I'm not.
[10:33.64]I'm not an umpire again.
[10:34.96]I'm just saying there's a reason.
[10:38.93]I want to have a mustache.
[10:40.69]Is that is that so weird?
[10:44.52]You look like a mafia boss.
[10:48.41]Come here.
[10:49.69]You, come here.
[10:53.27]Make the cam smaller.
[10:54.69]Yeah, I just want to show you my cool Pac-Man thing that I got there.
[10:57.55]It makes me happy.
[10:59.46]My hair is a mess.
[11:01.62]I gotta work on that.
[11:03.88]Yeah, this is the setup.
[11:05.78]Temporarily, it's not quite there, but it will be.
[11:10.35]Shrink this a little.
[11:12.78]Yeah, I can actually go like this now.
[11:17.52]This is how you should be streaming.
[11:19.74]Those of you streamers that are watching right now, oh, you're doing it completely wrong.
[11:23.64]I was doing it wrong for 10 years.
[11:27.08]Being able to do this, I got the keyboard right here.
[11:30.26]I got the mouse on a table that's connected to the recliner armchair.
[11:37.24]I've got all my little things over here.
[11:40.45]I've got my knobs over here.
[11:43.17]You're gonna get seasick.
[11:45.89]I'm gonna, like, puke.
[11:48.59]Please don't turn the fucking- Please don't have the computer turned off again.
[11:51.65]I'm, like, terrified right now.
[11:54.54]I went- It's- This is so- Of course, it has to happen on my stream, right?
[11:59.34]I sat down, I was wicked relaxed.
[12:01.20]I was like, oh, I can't wait to fucking play Resident Evil's DLC in my new, comfortable setup.
[12:08.64]Mmm!
[12:09.45]And now I'm- Now I'm no longer comfortable.
[12:11.25]Now I'm like-
[12:13.46]my fucking home is my computer gonna turn all the power off but hey it is what it is but alright I'm ready to play I'm ready to chill and hang out and play the uh DLC look at this oh yeah okay separate ways right I'm just ready to go are we ready
[12:44.02]Trim your toenails?
[12:44.92]Nah.
[12:46.36]Nah.
[12:46.70]I'm just going to keep them going.
[12:51.79]Only separate ways challenges can be earned in the... Okay, yeah, that's fine.
[12:55.47]Costumes and accessories set in the extras menu will be applied.
[12:57.97]Yeah, we already know all this.
[13:03.80]Wait, different... Whoa, wait, hold on a second.
[13:11.54]Oh, right.
[13:12.00]I already have all these.
[13:15.90]So what should I do for a costume?
[13:23.18]Your new setup has a weird camera angle.
[13:25.01]Well, this is temporary.
[13:25.95]A lot of this is going to move back.
[13:27.99]You're going to be able to see the Reddit shelf when I decide to do cam.
[13:30.55]I'm not going to do it every time, right?
[13:32.47]But you're romantic?
[13:34.49]Yeah, sure.
[13:37.43]Is Leon even in?
[13:40.15]I guess so.
[13:41.77]Isn't it Ada's storyline?
[13:44.05]Eh, who cares?
[13:44.53]Let's just go.
[13:46.13]Uh, I'm retired, so... I'm just gonna play on standard.
[13:53.42]Do pinstripe?
[13:54.60]Alright, shh.
[13:56.05]Cutscene.
[13:56.63]Quiet.
[14:14.45]For those of you that don't know, this takes place at the same time as the other game.
[14:19.17]And you cross paths and shit.
[14:21.03]It's way too loud.
[14:23.89]I can't even hear myself talk.
[14:43.25]Who is... What is this?
[14:55.16]Why is he dancing?
[14:56.32]I don't know.
[14:56.68]I think because he knows he's going to escape.
[15:04.41]It's just a complete overconfidence.
[15:12.37]Turn the game up.
[15:16.04]You got it.
[15:16.36]I might have to change some of the audio adjustments here, though.
[15:39.50]That was sick.
[15:42.08]Alright, is it weird that for one second I did not know that was Ada?
[15:58.29]I was like, oh, of course that was Ada in the costume.
[16:09.02]Alright, here we go.
[16:11.16]You guys ready?
[16:11.70]Scary game, so the camera has to be on.
[16:33.51]Alright, I did play this last night.
[16:37.25]Just to get the controls down again.
[16:38.57]I kind of remember, but I kind of don't.
[16:40.29]Alright, let me turn it up.
[16:42.31]It is low.
[16:42.81]It's kind of up all the way.
[16:54.10]That's weird.
[16:58.22]I think it's alright now.
[17:08.83]I think I actually, if I do that too much, I will puke.
[17:11.57]I actually have to be careful.
[17:18.91]Is this hold?
[17:19.41]No, it's hold, right?
[17:22.13]Dad arc.
[17:24.27]That's right.
[17:25.59]I'm going full dad mode.
[17:48.27]up you go luis boss fight dude I hope they give us a boss fight immediately no sorry what kind of a man leaves a lady
[18:15.70]Then we meet at the church.
[18:17.00]Let's not make it a funeral.
[18:18.26]Is that do we actually have to do this right now?
[18:24.44]Oh shit, I have to be ready.
[18:39.93]Let's beat it.
[18:49.16]Ada has a machine gun?
[18:50.80]That's pretty cool.
[18:56.00]Oh, okay.
[18:57.64]Ada has a machine gun?
[18:58.59]Oh, that's pretty cool.
[19:00.87]Alright.
[19:01.49]Alright, fight the black robe.
[19:11.39]I can parry, right?
[19:15.32]Oh, no, it's evade, not parry.
[19:21.92]C is evade.
[19:22.46]I might want to change that.
[19:28.40]Does Ada have like a move where you can punch?
[19:35.95]Oh, I thought I killed it.
[19:36.95]I thought it was dead.
[19:44.77]I don't... Was this in the original?
[19:47.42]I don't remember this.
[19:50.41]Alright, don't run out of bullets.
[19:59.40]Oh my god, they're everywhere.
[20:24.04]Okay.
[20:25.68]Unit died of Pinwheel.
[20:26.62]I just killed it.
[20:33.73]Alright.
[20:34.47]Where's the map?
[20:35.03]There's a map, right?
[20:35.53]Okay.
[20:35.81]This is my favorite part where you go find every item.
[20:45.07]Submachine gun.
[20:46.61]Very cool.
[20:49.36]Volume is still low.
[20:50.74]Yeah.
[20:51.76]That's very strange considering.
[20:54.88]I'll turn it up all the way.
[20:55.86]Something I'll figure out later, but we'll just keep it up all the way.
[21:00.78]Tell me if it's, if it's two, let's see.
[21:03.87]Oh, that's fine.
[21:05.61]Standard Andy.
[21:06.47]Alright.
[21:31.12]Thank you for telling me.
[21:34.44]Because 5,000 people are about to scream at me.
[21:43.47]Can I get in here?
[21:48.64]You're covering up the weapon indicator?
[21:50.68]Oh, I got... Can I go up here?
[21:55.74]Is up here better?
[21:59.09]Probably.
[22:08.79]Gunpowder.
[22:12.87]Remember, every time I do a Boston accent, I have to kind of move like this.
[22:15.51]Oh, what is that?
[22:16.95]Gunpowder?
[22:18.91]Why is that?
[22:22.59]Why?
[22:23.33]Control, come in.
[22:24.97]Louise hit the Amber, but I've sent him to retrieve it.
[22:30.73]Control, do you copy?
[22:31.57]I'm listening.
[22:34.30]Go on.
[22:36.76]We ran into some unexpected trouble.
[22:39.42]And?
[22:40.98]What will you do about it?
[22:42.76]Weska!
[22:43.48]Louise is already en route to the church.
[22:45.92]I'm tracking him every step of the way.
[22:49.98]Then I suggest you hurry.
[22:52.96]Copy.
[22:55.94]Just need to confirm my route first.
[22:57.68]Heading out to get a visual of the area.
[23:05.95]Whoa, alright, hold on.
[23:09.19]I was just scared to shit.
[23:10.55]I tried to run.
[23:11.31]I tried to run.
[23:13.03]I was trying to sprint because I was going to look around.
[23:16.17]That scared the shit out of me for some reason.
[23:18.43]I don't know why.
[23:21.74]OK, I want to go back down there.
[23:23.23]I wasn't done.
[23:29.37]That's where I need to go.
[23:31.45]Stick to the high ground.
[23:33.33]You have the means.
[23:36.71]I gotta get over there.
[23:38.15]Don't forget your mission.
[23:38.81]Alright, all the way across there.
[23:42.97]So it's a lot.
[23:43.51]It's gonna be a lot of grappling.
[23:45.39]Nothing else matters.
[23:47.59]Wrap this little tour up.
[23:52.25]Okay, I want to collect items I gotta go headshots only for 10 straight minutes start the clock mods Grapple gun.
[24:10.82]Oh, that's right.
[24:11.44]Okay, cool That's what her melee is I Probably shouldn't have done that
[24:24.79]Can I restart?
[24:44.49]Please just let me restart.
[24:46.19]I'm restarting because I got hit by the meteor.
[24:50.17]I got hit by the fucking meteor.
[24:51.41]Hold on a second.
[24:55.38]I got hit by the meteor.
[24:56.48]Just give me one minute.
[25:02.84]I got a new setup.
[25:03.54]I got to get used to.
[25:04.16]I'm too comfy.
[25:05.36]I'm getting too comfortable.
[25:07.96]Maybe I should just not do that.
[25:15.37]Maybe I just not attack yet.
[25:16.37]I can sneak up on people, right?
[25:26.96]Yeah, don't shoot me, buddy.
[25:41.69]What am I doing?
[25:48.48]Ooh, okay.
[25:48.82]Can I get up there?
[25:50.52]I have to be this close.
[25:57.69]Yeah, I looked down to see where C was.
[25:59.55]Get over it.
[26:08.46]Ooh, give me these.
[26:15.74]Bruh, don't, hey, don't you bruh me.
[26:19.00]I need to look sometimes.
[26:20.36]It's a new computer.
[26:37.93]Just right there.
[26:38.53]There's gotta be some kind of achievement, right?
[26:44.01]Kill everybody without, uh... setting off the alarm?
[26:47.98]Alright, get away from the meteor!
[26:59.16]I'll need to disable the catapults.
[27:06.38]Is it still falling?
[27:09.08]How long does it take to land?
[27:10.12]Alright, I want it.
[27:15.84]This is why I came down here.
[27:16.78]Oh yeah, I'll take the jewels.
[27:19.62]Very cool, very cool, very cool.
[27:27.39]Oh my God, they're raining hell.
[27:33.79]Thinking I come out of his head?
[27:34.57]No, we're good.
[27:42.13]I gotta kill the person on the catapult, right?
[27:49.07]Didn't hurt me, I'm fine.
[28:07.72]Stop shooting these at me!
[28:09.10]Oh my god, I hate these things.
[28:29.71]Red herb.
[28:30.25]Alright, where... I need a grapple hook area.
[29:01.77]You look like my dad.
[29:05.78]Alright.
[29:06.48]I can't.
[29:06.84]Hold on a second.
[29:09.00]Where's the grapple hook?
[29:36.27]Am I safe down here?
[29:42.20]I don't think so.
[29:44.76]You look like the owner of this castle.
[29:55.07]That's actually pretty good.
[29:57.69]That was actually very good.
[30:01.05]That was an 11 out of 10.
[30:09.77]Alright, there goes one.
[30:14.39]Oh shit, OK.
[30:16.02]So where can I go from here?
[30:17.00]It's gotta be a grapple hook from here, right?
[30:28.42]They wouldn't have emphasized the grapple hook if I couldn't use it.
[30:30.51]A lot more frequently than I am right now.
[30:35.29]Down to the ground level?
[30:38.87]You look like Gabby J, 10 years younger.
[30:41.15]Oh, that's actually awesome.
[30:43.17]You look like a handyman.
[30:48.23]Keep them coming.
[30:48.79]These are great.
[30:53.90]Oh, what needs doing over there, huh?
[31:05.06]Hey, what?
[31:05.40]You got a problem with your sink?
[31:06.31]Hey, give me a call.
[31:10.89]I'm not gonna fix it, I'm gonna fuck it up even... No more talking.
[31:16.47]Oh, that's about to kill me.
[31:26.85]Where's the grapple hook?
[31:29.74]I don't think I can go that way.
[31:35.50]Can I?
[31:37.48]They gave me the grapple hook tutorial and I only used it once.
[31:47.98]Dude, where's the grapple hook?
[31:52.40]She's like, oh, yeah.
[31:53.83]I'll use my grapple hook to get over there.
[31:56.29]Oh, just kidding.
[31:56.85]It's in one spot.
[32:04.18]Oh, great.
[32:19.86]You look like the third Mario brother.
[32:21.22]I like that one too.
[32:24.58]Okay.
[32:25.56]What the hell is going on here?
[32:26.90]I can't reach from here.
[32:33.02]Can I reach with this grenade?
[32:34.32]What the fuck is going on?
[32:40.47]Can somebody help?
[32:57.60]Why do I not understand what's going on here?
[33:04.97]You have to go down?
[33:07.87]Well, when I walked over here, it was just unloading these bombs and I couldn't keep walking.
[33:11.72]And there's no grapple hook.
[33:19.35]Come on, Jack.
[33:20.55]Raise the cannon.
[33:21.63]Oh my God.
[33:22.49]This is okay.
[33:23.51]This is what happens when you don't play a game and a DLC comes out like four months later.
[33:29.45]That's right.
[33:30.29]I forgot that thing existed.
[33:31.31]Alright.
[33:35.31]How do I open it up?
[33:39.68]How do I get in there?
[34:05.57]How do I get in this fucking room?
[34:07.91]Okay, there it is.
[34:08.79]Alright, now we can start playing.
[34:17.68]Jesus Christ.
[34:37.90]I thought I was supposed to use the grapple hook.
[34:40.55]And like... No.
[34:44.53]Shoot him with the cannon.
[34:45.43]Like in the regular game that you played.
[34:47.31]That did the trick.
[34:55.63]Thanks!
[35:05.66]Alright, let's go.
[35:19.77]Alright, there we go.
[35:43.98]Now this is what I thought I was going to be doing.
[35:58.00]Oh shit.
[36:03.80]No, I'm not.
[36:04.84]Oh, that hurt.
[36:05.60]Actually, you know what?
[36:06.12]I'm fine.
[36:15.58]I have to use this now, don't I?
[36:19.44]No.
[36:20.18]Wait, is it red and green does extra health?
[36:23.66]Or you have to do all three, right?
[36:30.80]So I shouldn't use that.
[36:36.72]Be very careful.
[36:46.05]How did that miss?
[36:52.15]What are these cannonballs?
[36:53.55]Like tiny little bowling balls?
[36:56.85]Like candle pin?
[37:00.37]Yeah, they are.
[37:00.81]Alright, cool.
[37:08.34]Okay, there's one more up here.
[37:13.09]Yeah, there we go.
[37:16.13]I really need to find other health.
[37:33.72]Nothing personal.
[37:36.80]I scared the shit out of somebody.
[37:53.89]Alright, did I miss anything up here?
[38:10.15]How do you look like that?
[38:12.37]You look like you hate Sonic.
[38:22.40]I think I need to be a little fatter for that one.
[38:33.32]Oh, but hold on.
[38:34.36]Do I be Dr. Robotnik for Halloween or do I stay with Count Dracula?
[38:40.13]That's very hard now that you said that.
[38:47.17]I don't know.
[38:52.71]Do both.
[38:55.27]I don't think I can do both.
[39:01.13]Cutscene?
[39:05.50]You look old and pale in the new angle.
[39:06.85]I am old and pale.
[39:29.32]Or it'll ruin the, uh, ruin the surprise for you.
[39:33.12]Separate ways.
[40:04.96]I'm heading to meet Luis at the rendezvous point now.
[40:08.16]I'm seeing increased movement from Los Eliminados.
[40:11.54]Don't get careless.
[40:14.84]Copy.
[40:15.76]Ada out.
[40:19.95]Okay.
[40:20.17]Almost at the church.
[40:24.47]Chapter two already.
[40:26.59]That was a whole chapter.
[40:28.09]Okay.
[40:31.55]So what is that?
[40:34.49]Let me go.
[40:35.17]I got a scope, didn't I?
[40:37.81]What is this?
[40:39.50]That's a knife.
[40:40.90]Sorry about that.
[40:43.32]Okay, there we go.
[40:54.03]He's in an executive chair.
[40:57.25]Right.
[40:58.89]I don't know why an executive is cracking his neck as in like, yeah, bring it on.
[41:03.11]I don't know what that was for.
[41:07.95]Alright, let's... Anything else on the map?
[41:10.79]Just that.
[41:12.12]Which is cool.
[41:15.64]Okay.
[41:16.74]I might brown out my computer.
[41:18.38]I just want to make sure everyone's aware.
[41:21.64]I got a lot of testing to do if it happens.
[41:23.70]But it could happen.
[41:25.97]It might happen right now.
[41:29.17]If it happens right now, then I will know exactly what's going on.
[41:36.41]So everyone say prayers.
[41:38.01]I'm gonna go down.
[41:52.58]Can I jump down?
[41:53.46]No, not yet.
[42:04.86]She saw me.
[42:17.95]I got him
[42:47.24]Well, there's gonna be a chainsaw person down there.
[42:49.64]There's gonna be a chainsaw dude.
[42:53.26]I bet you there's a chainsaw person down there.
[43:04.21]Only handgun for a while?
[43:06.61]You look like you own this castle.
[43:10.53]I I want to write that one's going down in the notebook.
[43:12.88]Sorry old man sounds.
[43:34.57]I probably shouldn't blow that up.
[43:40.44]stand up into it uh how shitty is this setup I have a lot of bullets I think I got everything yet
[44:18.54]I feel like I'm at an open mic night where one dude won't get off the stage.
[44:25.06]You go to open mic night and the guy has an entire streaming set up on the stage and he's just playing Resident Evil 4 to the audience.
[44:34.75]That actually is kind of funny.
[44:36.31]If somebody does that, I want a 5% credit for it.
[44:40.49]Somebody should go, like, do a comedy night, right?
[44:43.57]Make sure you get permission first.
[44:46.77]Be like, yeah, it's my routine.
[44:48.17]It's me, Bill.
[44:49.77]I am Bill Comedy.
[44:52.89]And hey, let me talk about airplanes for a second.
[44:55.73]And then stop talking and just bring out an entire streaming setup and just play Resident Evil with the monitor facing the audience.
[45:01.72]Looking back every so often like, whoa, did you see that?
[45:04.62]You're going to get booed off stage, as you deserve.
[45:18.09]I got it.
[45:18.45]Don't reload at a time like this!
[45:33.71]You missed your opportunity!
[45:38.73]Out of all the times to reload, why that time?
[45:47.48]Jesus!
[45:56.04]Did I get hit by that?
[46:08.31]Oh my god!
[46:12.21]I forgot about those.
[46:13.16]If the head's like this, that means they're like 10 times stronger.
[46:17.71]Okay, well I fucked that whole thing up by like running and like... I'm not that far, I'm right here.
[46:50.70]Like somebody that calls himself a man of culture.
[46:59.19]I have to have a craft beer here.
[47:02.15]I actually thought about it.
[47:03.19]I thought I was going to have a craft beer.
[47:07.93]And just I was going to take a sip out of it every hour.
[47:11.12]Oh, my God.
[47:11.92]Play the game.
[47:15.80]How did that hit me?
[47:16.40]I'm looking down.
[47:21.12]Oh shit my hand is a little sweaty.
[47:31.86]Hold on, my hand is sweaty.
[47:34.28]Oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck, oh fuck.
[47:59.05]Is he dead?
[47:59.63]Alright.
[48:00.49]I should be fine now.
[48:06.47]I don't want to take this shit right now.
[48:10.96]I have to.
[48:11.68]That stinks.
[48:25.50]How do I do the grapple hook thing again?
[48:32.42]Shipped right?
[48:33.14]How do you do the grapple hook melee?
[49:01.02]Yellow.
[49:17.18]Alright, that went a little better.
[49:18.16]A little.
[49:22.14]Can we just get one katana pick?
[49:34.18]Like, I own a katana?
[49:40.69]You want a katana?
[49:41.61]I don't own a katana.
[49:49.50]Do all goofy men in their late 30s own katanas?
[49:53.57]Am I behind on this?
[49:58.85]Yeah, yeah, yeah, they do.
[50:01.15]Alright, where am I going?
[50:33.38]I think I got everything.
[50:35.08]I got most.
[50:35.82]Wait, what's that over there?
[50:55.00]To do the gravel, you just need to hit the melee key from far away.
[51:00.14]Interesting.
[51:10.56]Put a fedora on right now.
[51:12.52]I need a fedora.
[51:18.85]I'm seeing quite the crowd here.
[51:22.45]I wonder what has them so riled up.
[51:26.55]The president's daughter.
[51:32.07]Turn on hand cam?
[51:32.79]Uh, I don't have one of those.
[52:13.16]I'm not missing anything right now.
[52:14.76]Don't the treasures show up on the map?
[52:17.48]Oh, you guys gaslit the hell out of me last time I played this.
[52:20.04]That's not accurate.
[52:36.98]Let me sort this.
[52:43.80]I can craft right now.
[52:45.44]Alright, what should I do?
[52:46.58]Should I just get submachine gun ammo?
[52:49.71]How tall is the monitor?
[52:50.55]Well, it's not going to be like this in the very near future.
[52:53.97]I actually don't mind this angle, though.
[52:57.31]I think it looks pretty fine.
[52:59.47]But this wall back here, it's going to be a little bit... I'll be a little bit closer.
[53:04.85]No, it depends on how I do it, but I'll probably be closer to the wall.
[53:08.61]And then this will be a little bit further away.
[53:32.45]I like the new setup.
[53:38.01]Well, it just allows me to sit back.
[53:40.48]It's much more comfortable.
[53:44.49]I'll be really honest last.
[53:46.51]I want to say last couple years.
[53:48.93]Sitting up at a desk has just been.
[53:51.33]It's just it's just causing me so many issues.
[53:56.49]I don't want to get into it.
[53:57.53]I know it's a broken record at this point talking about it, but being able to actually sit back changes everything for me.
[54:10.36]I'm able to stealth kill like all these people.
[54:21.99]Yeah, I thought of, you know, get a standing desk, but standing is not great either.
[54:26.22]This position I'm in right now is just the perfect position for me to do anything.
[54:33.74]Seated.
[54:34.98]Not really slouched, but have the support of my back at the upper chest area.
[54:40.02]Something about sitting in a chair like this.
[54:43.56]Much better.
[54:43.88]I'm much happier.
[54:48.62]Not that I was miserable before, but
[54:52.49]You all know I don't have to get into it.
[54:53.59]I want to go upstairs.
[54:58.50]Wait.
[54:58.66]No, no, no check every corner.
[54:59.72]Stop.
[55:25.69]I feel like there's probably something down there, but... Hold on.
[55:35.72]No.
[55:36.16]I was already up there.
[55:38.08]Alright.
[55:38.80]Let's go.
[55:39.27]I always feel like I'm going to miss something in these games.
[55:42.57]And I always do.
[55:43.23]I'm going to get surrounded, right?
[55:51.88]That's how it works.
[55:58.47]Is that person still alive?
[56:11.57]Get off me.
[56:29.16]we're good we're not good
[56:44.32]Stop exploding old people.
[56:46.74]You tried Baldur's Gate 3?
[56:48.62]Yeah, Holly and I actually played it for a little bit, but I got a little distracted with other stuff.
[56:53.85]But I do want to get back into it.
[56:56.49]We did the first maybe 5 to 10 hours.
[56:58.81]Nothing, anything past that.
[57:09.42]Can't I... Hold on a second.
[57:14.86]I need the two ovals, not rectangles, not the ovals.
[57:28.92]Try Voices of the Void.
[57:29.86]That game is perfect for you.
[57:33.27]I'll try it.
[57:41.13]She has her trust over there.
[57:44.78]He said it funny.
[57:46.82]I did.
[57:47.06]I did say it funny.
[57:58.61]You're too self-aware.
[57:59.71]I have to be.
[58:05.37]Sometimes I can't even put up with my own bullshit.
[58:07.20]You know what I mean?
[58:08.18]I have to be.
[58:23.57]Nice.
[58:28.61]Okay.
[58:30.09]What's the goal here?
[58:30.81]Just to go down here.
[58:32.73]Okay.
[58:38.09]You forgot to clean the chocolate milk mustache off.
[58:43.76]I can't.
[58:45.02]Anytime I try to do something like this, it's just disgusting.
[58:55.13]but I'm doing it I'm doing it I'm doing it this isn't the way to the church how much did this vtuber avatar cost
[59:26.77]Unparastero!
[59:27.79]What the fuck?
[60:03.02]He knows how to speak Resident Evil.
[60:15.35]Okay.
[60:15.59]Am I missing something?
[60:16.39]Nope.
[60:34.81]Leon, why am I not surprised?
[60:40.78]So kind of you to keep our friends busy.
[60:43.70]He's such a dickhead.
[60:46.20]This way looks promising.
[60:59.56]I'm not even looking.
[61:00.38]I'm not even looking.
[61:02.58]I missed.
[61:20.81]I love this engine.
[61:23.69]You know, I know I'm the fuck Capcom guy.
[61:25.95]I know that, but...
[61:30.02]I think they actually might be, as of right now, probably one of the better game company that exists right now.
[61:36.13]I think they've had like five bangers in a row.
[61:38.87]And I can't, like, I can't deny that.
[61:40.47]It's like, I think that they're doing a wonderful job.
[61:44.18]A wonderful job.
[61:56.12]But that was just, that was just anger coming out.
[61:58.21]I didn't actually mean that.
[61:59.43]I was mad because I couldn't change the FOV and I got very upset about it.
[62:04.39]Like irrationally upset.
[62:05.57]There's no reason to be that mad about it.
[62:06.97]Is this gonna fall?
[62:37.53]I think that's what happens when you play on standard mode.
[62:40.65]Oh, just in time, bros.
[63:11.86]Okay.
[63:13.74]Shit up top, shit at the bottom.
[63:16.08]They both have little circles on them.
[63:28.85]Okay, I have to use the mouse scroll.
[63:31.03]That's it, right?
[63:33.65]Oh, I think... Alright, where's the other one?
[63:42.45]The two birds.
[63:51.26]Is it that one?
[63:51.82]It's like the opposite to kind of.
[63:57.46]Either this one or this one.
[64:06.32]I'm pretty sure it's that one.
[64:07.57]Alright, but we need the third one.
[64:10.35]I can't do it without third one.
[64:21.55]Where's this painted?
[64:22.49]Down there?
[64:22.85]Oh, he's going to get up.
[64:42.71]He's going to get up.
[64:43.19]He's going to get up.
[64:43.73]He's going to get up.
[64:52.86]Okay.
[64:55.62]He figured it out?
[65:00.04]Wait, what's this?
[65:01.88]Oh, it's one of those get all the blue things.
[65:06.12]Six spinals.
[65:07.21]Alright, so are they listed?
[65:08.51]They are.
[65:08.97]So this one's right behind me.
[65:16.33]Where is it?
[65:21.07]Oh, there it is.
[65:21.47]I see it.
[65:26.74]Did I see it?
[65:27.26]I think I did.
[65:34.10]Where are the other ones?
[65:37.22]Okay.
[65:38.48]Uh... What is it?
[65:40.90]It is... It's the... I need to get this guy out of the way.
[65:51.76]How do I move this guy?
[65:54.34]I think it's the two...
[65:57.06]How do I move this guy?
[65:58.12]I think I know which one it is.
[66:02.96]It's the double... It's the two... One, two, and then... I'll figure it out.
[66:19.86]skip VOD watchers skip no VOD watchers stay here don't leave unless you've got something to do you might have an appointment you have like other stuff going on maybe your friends coming over maybe like school you got to go to maybe you've got um like food to eat or something don't go unless any of those things are happening maybe you've like playing a game on your own maybe you don't feel like watching TV or streaming today that's fine but any other scenario don't go
[66:49.23]It's which one is it?
[66:50.99]Is it this one?
[66:51.63]No.
[66:54.68]It's like a double bump.
[66:56.20]Is it this right here?
[67:06.18]Was it that?
[67:13.45]I had like two bumps.
[67:18.80]Fucking one of these.
[67:25.15]One, two, but the guy is in the way.
[67:28.46]It's not my fault.
[67:30.32]Does he despawn?
[67:34.84]Get the fuck out of there.
[67:36.12]I don't care.
[67:36.81]It's worth it.
[67:52.87]What is on the right here?
[67:53.87]That's what I need.
[67:54.69]Okay, one, two, wait.
[67:55.97]Okay.
[67:59.01]One, two, three?
[68:06.59]He's only covering 5% of the design.
[68:08.74]Yeah, but it's important to know it.
[68:12.68]I think it's the one.
[68:13.38]It's one, two, three.
[68:14.40]There's a third one right there.
[68:15.28]He's just in the way.
[68:15.76]It's one, two, three.
[68:17.90]It's three of those squiggly swirlies, whatever they are.
[68:30.05]Right, pretty sure this is it.
[68:40.22]Yeah.
[68:43.24]Only like two options, but I want to do the puzzle.
[68:45.30]I don't want to just.
[68:46.82]I don't want it to be handed to me by a chat member saying that one third one from the left.
[68:52.94]That's not me.
[68:53.46]I don't think I need to deal yet.
[69:00.32]Blue medallions.
[69:01.90]I wanted to run that way.
[69:03.46]I didn't... I literally turned around.
[69:11.86]I literally turned around.
[69:14.59]Oh, god damn it, man.
[69:17.35]Well, can I go back?
[69:18.51]I doubt it.
[69:37.40]some shit over here, though.
[69:47.73]I might actually have to restart.
[69:57.86]Hey, Red Dead Redemption figured this out a long time ago.
[70:00.18]Hold shift for two seconds to grapple hook.
[70:06.98]Tap shift is in a tap shift.
[70:08.68]That doesn't work.
[70:09.18]Hold shift is run.
[70:10.50]Whatever.
[70:10.86]I don't know how to figure this shit.
[70:11.88]I don't know how to fix this.
[70:21.23]I really want those.
[70:21.97]Where's the auto save?
[70:29.13]Shit, it was right now.
[70:32.03]Well, looks like we're not getting those spinals.
[70:36.21]Ten seconds ago.
[71:11.38]Hey!
[71:22.81]Okay.
[71:23.97]That kind of... That... Whatever.
[71:27.41]It's okay.
[71:29.23]Hey, we don't even need him.
[71:29.97]I don't want to miss the shit here, though.
[71:41.88]I'm upset about that.
[71:42.82]I'm upset.
[71:46.48]What do I do about this?
[72:03.75]Restart the whole DLC?
[72:05.15]No.
[72:05.51]Jerm, I'm sorry people are so mean to you.
[72:09.70]They don't mean it.
[72:12.71]It's alright.
[72:30.92]I do.
[72:32.83]Well, you know what?
[72:33.43]I don't give a shit.
[72:38.59]The guy gave a fuck.
[72:46.14]Cut scene.
[73:29.20]Minus one.
[73:29.72]I know the vision, but the sounds were sad.
[73:32.10]I like how I got a half point on that.
[73:36.91]Well, no, actually it's a half negative point.
[73:39.33]Hey.
[73:41.35]I know the vision was there.
[73:46.26]The vision was there.
[73:51.63]I feel like I just auditioned for American Idol and I was not very good, but you didn't want to tell me I wasn't good.
[73:56.71]Because you didn't want me to like scream at you.
[74:00.24]Oh.
[74:21.06]Hey, what's that line?
[74:22.64]Where's everybody going?
[74:24.60]Bingo.
[74:26.31]Wait, why is he dressed like this?
[74:32.99]Why is he dressed like that?
[74:35.37]Why is he dressed like that?
[74:36.60]That didn't happen in my game.
[74:38.16]First time is free.
[74:41.32]Why does he look like that?
[74:43.82]Don't keep me waiting, Luis.
[74:49.47]I didn't even know that was Leon.
[74:50.87]We're supposed to know that that's like a, wow, this is that part that everybody thinks is funny and cool.
[74:55.46]I thought that was a different character.
[74:56.70]Do it.
[75:20.27]Hey, wait.
[75:23.63]Sorry.
[75:24.91]I just hear that and I just have to do.
[75:27.31]No.
[75:31.19]She's pretty much sitting on a camel next time.
[75:33.09]Bro.
[75:34.90]Some of you guys need to fucking relax.
[75:43.26]Okay.
[75:49.96]God, this thing is fucking filthy.
[76:07.76]Where do I go?
[76:10.50]So we're, uh... Where do I go?
[76:27.23]It's locked.
[76:28.91]It's not locked.
[76:34.55]What of Ashley?
[76:35.71]We're locked in the church.
[76:36.67]Lily Point.
[76:37.57]Good time.
[76:37.99]I bet Leon's here to save us.
[76:41.35]Trevor from GTA.
[76:52.34]Any other stuff in here?
[76:58.59]he does he does that one was real uh was it is this a treasure map somebody write that down real quick
[77:31.58]Bird.
[77:34.65]Oh.
[77:39.79]What's up?
[77:57.30]Wait, can I break through?
[78:04.61]I can definitely get through that glass.
[78:07.13]Yeah, be kidding me.
[78:07.89]And I can't shoot up there?
[78:13.38]Why not?
[78:20.14]His bar is there.
[78:31.31]Well...
[78:38.00]Did I miss something in that door or around the side?
[78:40.60]Hold on.
[78:42.30]I would imagine I could have grapple hooked up to the top there, but I guess not.
[78:52.43]Once we go back, wait.
[78:53.31]What?
[78:59.95]Can't get up there?
[79:06.44]Why don't we do that?
[79:09.18]I've asked this question before and I've never gotten an answer.
[79:11.58]How come anytime you ever look down or anytime you rub your eye, everybody goes... What is the reflex in your brain that does that?
[79:27.95]Damn it.
[79:29.49]I was going to get a lot of people to think I was cool.
[79:36.18]Glasses?
[79:52.92]Somebody has a bomb.
[79:56.13]Do you?
[79:59.77]I'm trying to the melee when they're far away, but it's not.
[80:03.55]It's not doing it.
[80:07.17]Got to be really far away.
[80:18.72]Somebody has a grenade.
[80:22.42]I can hear it.
[80:30.77]Alright, so I need to go that way.
[80:37.01]Is the thing in one of the gravestones?
[80:38.87]It probably is, right?
[80:49.67]It's like in or on the back.
[80:51.03]Yeah, over here somewhere.
[81:08.10]It's the worst place to put that.
[81:28.50]OK.
[81:35.49]I don't see it over here.
[81:36.41]I just have to backtrack this whole way.
[81:38.67]I do.
[81:41.41]I did.
[81:55.61]Thank you.
[81:55.95]That scared the shit out of me.
[81:58.35]Good.
[82:28.41]Alright, I got money and I... I do have that case optimized shit, don't I?
[82:32.96]I don't have any keychains for it, though.
[82:39.64]Alright, trade.
[82:40.86]Wait, let me load these up first.
[82:43.16]Alright.
[82:58.51]Blue.
[82:59.13]I could do one and one.
[83:02.71]That'd be good.
[83:05.67]Or should I wait?
[83:08.36]Is two better?
[83:08.98]Should I do two red?
[83:16.86]I kind of don't want to lose all of them though.
[83:19.84]Two is better.
[83:20.56]Double is more.
[83:26.00]How much more?
[83:33.01]12,000.
[83:33.15]Yeah, let's do it.
[83:38.93]Oh, this is just for selling.
[83:39.97]Oh, this is just for selling.
[83:47.54]Oh, this is just for selling.
[83:49.40]Oh, this is just for selling.
[83:51.74]Oh, wait, trade?
[83:53.33]Oh, you can trade for spinals.
[83:55.95]Okay, that's interesting.
[83:56.89]I've got an itchy neck.
[84:00.82]ruby's all rubbish he makes no difference the price well that's our choice I don't need these glasses like wesker doesn't get pissed off or something like those are my glasses you found them why did you not give them back to me I don't think so thank you anything else I can help you with alright important you'll get some bang for your buck I
[84:28.79]Sawed off.
[84:30.71]W870.
[84:30.77]First aid spray.
[84:38.07]I want the case upgrade.
[84:45.08]Plus 50% submachine gun ammo craft bonus frequency.
[84:47.74]I mean, why not, right?
[84:53.52]All yours, stranger.
[85:01.74]Should I get this or am I going to find a better submachine gun in like 20 minutes?
[85:13.87]Get it?
[85:20.33]I'm going to get a first aid spray because I suck at video games and I need to make sure I have it in case I need it.
[85:28.09]You know, just buy these two.
[85:37.74]Punisher, that's is that accuracy or is that no firepower accuracy?
[85:43.92]Precision.
[85:44.70]Yeah, I'm going to keep it.
[85:48.10]Alright, tune up power.
[85:55.32]I think we're going to go power.
[86:02.46]I never use the submachine gun.
[86:03.54]I might as well this time.
[86:08.58]Prepare the knife.
[86:14.15]I could.
[86:17.67]I feel like I'm not going to use this that frequently.
[86:22.05]I'd rather just not have this.
[86:23.53]It takes a lot of space.
[86:30.60]What do I have here?
[86:42.00]Hold on.
[86:42.22]I need to make some stuff.
[86:43.40]Okay.
[86:46.10]I could make a ton of submachine gun ammo.
[86:50.36]I could make rifle ammo too.
[86:51.94]Or handgun ammo.
[86:52.64]Yeah.
[86:54.08]Let's go submachine gun.
[87:00.08]Ooh, nice.
[87:00.76]Okay, I'm going to hold off now.
[87:09.43]A lot of ammo.
[87:15.04]Got two heals.
[87:16.40]I'll be fine.
[87:18.88]You hate the shotgun?
[87:19.94]Well, I mean, the last time I played this, I did 50 round shotgun and just unloaded on the last boss and beat the game in 10 seconds.
[87:28.64]I didn't even have this equipped.
[87:30.00]Oh my god, I'm such a dope.
[87:31.12]I don't know why I thought it was on automatically for some reason.
[87:45.85]Okay, let's go.
[87:49.91]So far, this is fun.
[87:50.57]I like it.
[87:51.55]Just more of a resume before.
[87:57.45]Alright, this thing is ready to go.
[88:02.91]So what's next?
[88:04.05]Into the village square.
[88:05.16]Should I make the rifle ammo and just have it?
[88:13.12]I feel like maybe I will need it.
[88:19.84]I'll think about it.
[88:26.62]Let's go.
[88:28.95]I don't have enough money to repair the knife.
[88:31.71]So.
[88:33.34]We aren't going to do that.
[88:36.34]You get some thoughts.
[88:37.54]Unusual.
[88:38.10]Yeah, yeah.
[88:38.72]I said beast.
[88:41.12]Uh-huh.
[88:41.88]That thing is coming.
[88:42.80]Okay, master.
[88:43.56]I beg you.
[88:44.10]Alright.
[88:49.14]Okay, cool.
[88:52.84]Boom.
[88:58.14]Oh, I gotta start doing 1080p streaming as well.
[89:00.88]I'm thinking about how I'm going to do that.
[89:03.59]Or maybe I just won't.
[89:05.39]864p all the way.
[89:06.29]Alright, I thought that was Darth Vader when I came over here.
[89:10.71]Like right now, that was Darth Vader.
[89:23.89]Make the switch right now.
[89:27.39]Um...
[89:29.02]We'll see.
[89:31.26]If anything, I probably would... What's the bitrate I stream at right now?
[89:36.59]I'm pretty sure I'm at the maximum allowed bitrate for Twitch, but I'm going to look into that again because I might be able to increase it by like 500 to 1,000, which might just fix everything.
[89:46.49]Not that the stream looks terrible, but... But, eh.
[89:53.54]We'll see.
[89:59.13]Make the rifle ammo.
[89:59.91]I don't have one of these burritos.
[90:31.91]Alright, this is definitely the actual fight.
[90:39.84]Okay.
[90:41.00]What do we got?
[90:45.68]Harry, you have a knife?
[90:47.56]Oh, that's why they were saying you should repair the knife.
[90:50.73]Jerma, Jerma, can you hear us?
[90:52.61]Jerma, please, you need to repair the knife.
[90:54.77]Oh, I see now.
[91:03.97]I think I just did it though.
[91:13.86]You tell me to parry and then you tell me to press C on the keyboard.
[91:16.74]Come on Gwyn.
[91:33.40]Where are you?
[91:53.51]Shit, tried to parry it.
[92:06.46]Does that mean it's locked?
[92:10.04]Yes.
[92:20.39]God damn it, not again.
[92:24.25]Oh, I got it.
[92:24.67]This is the real one.
[92:36.69]Oh, shit!
[92:41.46]No!
[92:43.02]I don't need to do that yet.
[92:57.92]He's fake.
[93:11.86]The fog.
[93:12.88]It's getting thicker.
[93:40.53]You idiot.
[93:54.49]Got it.
[94:16.35]kind of what is wrong with me okay now for the village chief's house burning flesh I thought I'd left that life behind
[94:44.78]Are you reclined?
[94:45.46]Uh, my legs are not up.
[94:50.84]But hey, in the future.
[94:52.88]Might be an opportunity where I would be in.
[94:57.82]Legs might be up.
[94:58.50]Alright, let me just make sure I get everything here.
[95:05.78]Let me replace all the stuff I just shot.
[95:10.72]Sausages?
[95:13.44]Corn.
[95:19.35]There are sausages right behind it, guys.
[95:42.87]Glass.
[95:49.35]Anything else?
[95:54.83]Yes.
[95:58.82]High five.
[96:09.35]OK, so that was this house.
[96:12.49]You know I'm checking every single one of these, right?
[96:17.35]And we shouldn't every single one of these.
[96:26.35]Shotgun.
[96:30.18]Boogers.
[96:45.99]Oh, Leon took it!
[96:53.06]Continuity.
[97:05.77]That it.
[97:08.99]Maybe.
[97:09.35]It's a quick rocking break.
[97:39.06]What is the green smudge behind you?
[97:40.76]It's making me want to... Hey, will you settle down?
[97:45.50]It's the whole Pac-Man crew.
[97:52.25]Settle down.
[97:52.83]Keep him.
[98:06.47]Oh, trust me.
[98:06.95]I will keep him.
[98:09.08]I just want to put them there because it was fun and I have a streamer room now.
[98:12.70]Alright, I could have... That's this one.
[98:16.10]There's one more, two more houses I want to look at.
[98:26.77]Anything else?
[98:27.47]I don't think so.
[98:35.81]Ooh, egg.
[98:43.29]Nice.
[98:46.50]There is an omega chest in here.
[98:47.90]Cool.
[99:05.41]This one, this one.
[99:05.99]There's one, what, two more houses?
[99:07.25]One, two.
[99:21.38]And over here.
[99:24.14]That's it.
[99:25.84]Did I get the item I was supposed to get?
[99:38.58]No, yeah, I don't think I did.
[99:39.68]I have to go.
[99:40.40]Right for the village chiefs.
[99:48.23]Did I get that item?
[99:51.33]I didn't, so... Where do I get that?
[100:03.66]Oh, yeah, maybe up there.
[100:16.21]Oh no, it's broken.
[100:24.68]Oh shit, I can go in here.
[100:29.33]Wait.
[100:34.69]Don't think I'm stupid.
[100:35.71]Don't think I'm stupid.
[100:36.33]Don't think I'm stupid.
[100:38.98]Please don't think I'm stupid.
[100:42.14]I have a reason for it.
[100:46.86]Okay, but in actuality though...
[100:56.11]I don't have the thing to put into the church thing.
[100:58.29]Get some aviators.
[101:14.68]Should I just go all the way back?
[101:25.66]I didn't really accomplish much besides... Yeah?
[101:35.45]Sure?
[101:38.13]No, I... No, I... I need that circular thing.
[101:41.58]I thought I was going to get it from that little boss fight, but I didn't get it.
[101:48.12]Are you pretending?
[101:49.10]No.
[101:51.57]Every time there's a cutscene, I go like this.
[101:53.99]And just watch what you guys say for five minutes.
[101:57.03]And then I turn back when the cutscene's over.
[102:00.53]And then the cutscene ends.
[102:02.55]And she has said the next step of the video game.
[102:05.65]And I've been just like hanging out over here.
[102:08.45]Just like chatting.
[102:12.17]Yeah, you guys are the cutscene for me.
[102:18.17]That's so funny to think about.
[102:20.75]Not every time, but a lot of time.
[102:22.12]It kind of works out that way.
[102:23.98]Name every bug.
[102:24.82]Beetle.
[102:25.48]Spider.
[102:26.48]Uh, arachnid.
[102:27.76]Um... Uh... Selpigid.
[102:32.77]Scorpion.
[102:40.13]Uh, wasp.
[102:41.31]Bee.
[102:46.60]Um...
[102:57.82]A weevil.
[102:58.32]Deathpainting beetle.
[103:23.48]Ant.
[103:24.85]Butterfly.
[103:25.49]Earwig.
[103:27.21]Okay, who cares?
[103:29.19]Oh, is it a cutscene?
[103:35.09]No, I'm paying attention now.
[103:51.02]The straw's not long enough.
[104:21.79]That's what she was there in that cutscene.
[104:47.39]Ada saves them.
[104:48.85]Ada saves them.
[104:49.35]It's pretty cool.
[104:55.42]That's my favorite chapter, I think.
[105:01.11]Anybody else do that?
[105:02.63]I hate that I do it, but I do.
[105:03.77]And it's so obvious, but you do it anyways.
[105:07.13]Something's on TV or a movie or a show or a game.
[105:09.77]Doesn't matter what it is.
[105:11.29]And you know what characters on screen.
[105:14.36]And you fall asleep for like five straight minutes.
[105:17.94]And when you know that everyone else is awake and you're not, you kind of wake up and just say the character's name and then the thing that they were just doing.
[105:24.90]Like, oh, yeah, I was watching, like, Ada on the Roof.
[105:27.75]Yep.
[105:28.97]Ada up on the roof.
[105:32.55]That was good.
[105:33.39]That was a good chapter.
[105:34.99]Pretty cool.
[105:37.65]What's, yeah, that's probably, like, the best part of the game, I think.
[105:41.03]And you were just sleeping for five, ten straight minutes.
[105:45.35]It's like, everybody knows you have no idea what just happened.
[105:48.83]And it sucks so bad when that person is then like, yeah, dude, oh, the part right before that too, like, remember that?
[105:55.14]It's like, oh shit, I'm getting quizzed.
[105:58.32]Yeah, oh.
[106:03.48]And then you make up shit that you started a new conversation.
[106:08.25]You say like, oh yeah, hey, did you upgrade?
[106:11.11]Did you upgrade that gun?
[106:13.59]When you upgraded that gun, are you going to continue to upgrade the machine gun?
[106:17.28]Then you get them talking and make sure that they continue to kind of lead the conversation to a new area.
[106:29.47]What a first world problem.
[106:31.67]Yeah.
[106:32.89]I'll say.
[106:33.37]That's social poker.
[106:46.34]No, that's... I don't want the person to think that I don't care or I'm not paying attention.
[106:52.64]Or I'd be like... Keep them busy, Leon.
[106:59.33]That outfit.
[107:01.21]That outfit is so funny.
[107:02.45]I wasn't sleeping.
[107:06.68]You pick things that you know you can ask an answer to.
[107:20.25]My sleepy dad does that a lot.
[107:23.01]Hope there's a lead on Louise here.
[107:28.55]Okay, I need a key.
[107:29.43]It's 3 a.m.
[107:35.76]in Europe.
[107:36.08]Why are you always alive at the worst times?
[107:39.50]Well... Here's you.
[107:42.28]And here am I. There's... 7 million miles between us.
[107:53.41]Sorry.
[107:55.85]Sorry, I'm really sorry.
[107:58.15]It's just the way it is.
[108:07.72]You said I have jowls?
[108:09.34]Who just said I had jowls?
[108:11.54]Ban that person for real.
[108:12.50]Like, don't let them ever come back.
[108:14.06]No, I don't.
[108:17.26]Whatever.
[108:21.57]Did anybody actually say that?
[108:22.93]I actually need to know.
[108:24.37]What did they actually say?
[108:26.71]And...
[108:46.62]Jowls detected.
[108:47.72]Reload all these guns.
[108:57.58]None of us are thinking about your jowls.
[109:04.81]They got permabanned.
[109:07.39]Let that be a lesson.
[109:10.41]All you little shits.
[109:19.16]This could use some cleaning.
[109:27.64]I can't leave empty handed.
[109:34.07]Uh-oh.
[109:34.93]Grandpa's coming out.
[109:36.29]Ooh, an extravagant clock.
[109:46.21]Oh, no.
[109:46.47]The recliner error.
[109:47.66]Yeah.
[109:50.36]I was going to have a cigar over here and have like a little, like a lighter.
[109:53.20]Just like take a break and be like, I'll be right back.
[109:56.60]Put it in and like just walk off camera.
[109:59.38]Okay, I still will.
[110:01.29]Just pretend you didn't see it.
[110:02.07]Pretend we didn't talk about it.
[110:12.11]OK, so cool.
[110:13.95]Very cool.
[110:16.01]Wait.
[110:22.31]Check every single corner.
[110:23.85]Yeah, that's why.
[110:25.35]What have we here?
[110:35.74]Hey.
[110:37.28]Wait.
[110:37.70]There was a.
[110:41.36]There was a bureau that a key could go into.
[110:46.02]Back here.
[110:46.64]There was a key.
[110:53.81]There was a keyhole.
[111:00.29]Look at that.
[111:06.06]I think if I put that key into the keyhole,
[111:12.21]Where is that room?
[111:31.52]Is he cooking?
[111:44.74]Fellas!
[111:45.56]Fellas!
[111:47.08]There's a keyhole.
[111:47.92]Holy... Okay.
[111:57.83]Whoa.
[112:00.31]This is probably important.
[112:01.35]Brothers and sisters, our lord is displeased.
[112:04.45]Do not recklessly slay outsiders at will.
[112:07.33]All people have a right to fair... Has anybody else found this?
[112:13.56]Henceforth, we shall deliver solemn justice without prejudice.
[112:15.92]Take any one you capture to the factory basement.
[112:19.08]Do the same with the traitors.
[112:25.03]I bet they took him here.
[112:26.31]I think you might be the first.
[112:29.09]I feel like, I mean, that's... Who would be able to put that together?
[112:32.43]It's, like, kind of hard.
[112:33.83]Most people just would give up, I think.
[112:34.93]Okay, so now I gotta go down here.
[112:41.60]Sounds good.
[112:42.24]Let's go.
[112:43.51]Can I like run out now?
[112:46.05]Chest?
[112:46.39]No.
[112:57.98]Is this a fight?
[113:11.26]I... What happened to him?
[113:16.96]No, what?
[113:17.72]There's going to be jewels and stuff back there.
[113:29.85]Whatever.
[113:33.59]You cannot be serious.
[113:34.57]There's no way you got a hold of me.
[113:38.49]This lady was magnetized to my body.
[113:53.67]Can you?
[113:54.17]I wonder if you can kill him.
[114:19.97]No, you can't.
[114:20.65]Leon kills him in like four hours from now.
[114:22.99]What am I talking about?
[114:24.03]Is there stuff in here?
[114:26.83]Who cares?
[114:40.64]Grapple!
[114:41.32]Grapple it!
[114:42.56]Grapple!
[114:56.99]Just kill me.
[114:57.53]Kill me.
[114:57.83]No, this doesn't count.
[115:09.94]I wouldn't have taken that much damage.
[115:11.34]Let me restart.
[115:12.70]Everybody just settle down.
[115:19.02]He's playing on standard.

[116:03.29]Still after me, huh?
[116:11.04]She does not sound concerned at all.
[116:24.29]Looks like I gave them the slip.
[116:31.39]He's too cool for this, yeah.
[116:40.24]If you turned around and started Fortnite dancing to that guy, do you think he would stop?
[116:42.80]Do you think he'd be like, oh.
[116:52.33]Or if you like held your hand out, like.
[116:54.21]Do you think he'd be like, oh, wait a minute.

[116:59.67]What does that mean?
[117:00.23]Why are you doing that?

[120:57.39]Got something.
[121:01.83]Interactive Retinal Inkroi System.
[121:05.73]The iris will allow you to see clues that are almost invisible.

[148:08.49]Yeah, kind of.
[148:09.13]Well, I'm settling back down.
[148:12.17]Doing some stretches, moving my legs around.
[148:13.75]You're going to stream on YouTube?
[148:22.21]I don't know.
[148:23.99]I know I want to do some YouTube content again.
[148:27.49]But I'm kind of just playing it by ear and just doing what I feel like on a day-to-day basis.
[148:33.18]At least in the content creation.
[148:38.48]Besides the off-brand stuff.
[148:40.82]Because that is usually... I usually spend at least a few hours.
[148:46.07]I'd say at least a few hours a month.
[148:50.01]Thinking about what I want to do.
[148:51.87]Or this... I'm just saying words.
[148:58.12]While I get this figured out.
[149:02.90]I promise I'm not high.
[149:04.32]I just... This keyboard... There we go.
[149:11.35]You didn't deny hating us earlier.
[149:12.67]I...
[149:19.32]Nah, but I like the hours I spend it off for in a week.
[149:23.12]Trying to still figure out what the good timing to stream is.
[149:25.56]I think I got a pretty good schedule here.
[149:27.24]He won't say it.
[149:38.31]I'm glad you all get it.
[149:40.82]I'm glad you all think it's humorous.
[149:46.09]Okay, let's go back.
[149:47.91]This looks good.
[149:49.63]Make sure the camera's in a good spot.
[149:58.29]Yeah, I'm... What's happening here?
[150:13.92]It wasn't tagged.
[150:14.76]It was...
[150:21.33]Okay.
[150:22.98]Take a sip.
[150:31.84]I looked in the mirror.
[150:32.40]I keep thinking of that person.
[150:34.00]I said I look like the guy that owns the castle.
[150:39.99]Alright.
[150:40.51]Hi.
[150:41.05]Okay.
[150:41.45]Are you ready?
[150:42.47]I'm ready.
[150:47.39]I want them back down actually.
[150:52.63]I love this little keyboard.
[150:53.99]This thing, before we get started and keep going.
[150:57.45]I can turn the volume up and down with this.
[151:03.16]Okay.
[151:04.82]Take a look at this thing.
[151:07.02]It's one of these.
[151:08.94]It's one of those half keyboards.
[151:12.00]It's not a full keyboard.
[151:12.92]It doesn't have all the number pad on it.
[151:16.52]It's awesome.
[151:18.47]It's a SteelSeries...
[151:22.24]Apex 3, the thing is awesome.
[151:24.18]It's great to just kind of sit right on the lap here.
[151:27.88]Perfect little ergonomic form factor, whatever you want to call it.
[151:32.99]Small keyboard.
[151:35.69]Oh, no sponsor?
[151:36.53]It's just... I just like it.
[151:39.01]It just works great for what I'm using it for, and that's it.
[151:46.77]Alright, what the hell was I just doing?
[151:48.99]Getting jewels from downstairs.
[151:52.48]Is this the scary part?
[151:53.24]Hey, hey, bro, bro, bro.
[151:54.86]Is this the scary part?
[152:11.54]Where is this?
[152:18.97]I have everything reloaded.
[152:26.15]You're really into bro tonight.
[152:27.69]Yeah.
[152:33.29]I'm just saying I'm in one of those.
[152:35.62]Just in a mood.
[152:36.44]You know, you get in the mood.
[152:37.28]You just kind of run with it.
[152:38.28]OK.
[152:42.52]So I need to just go up all the way up here.
[152:48.11]They're going to go out the front door.
[153:33.10]Push out of the way!
[153:33.90]No mejor!
[153:36.41]Mi cuerpo!
[154:01.47]Yeah, it's going to be some mood lighting back here eventually.
[154:03.49]It'll be nice.
[154:12.24]Not just the Pac-Man crew.
[154:33.33]El Estero.
[154:38.43]It's a Nell S Ron.
[154:41.91]Reunited at Odo El Mundo.
[154:47.23]This for this part, uh, Ness Nuestro Gran.
[154:53.38]He hope.
[154:57.66]Well, I could have just clicked it.
[154:59.78]The outsider is in the villa.
[155:01.54]Assemble the village.
[155:02.26]Awaken our great child.
[155:14.29]Okay.
[155:14.61]New items.
[155:15.33]Laser sight.
[155:17.23]Rocket launcher.
[155:17.95]What you see is what I've got.
[155:37.52]Oh, a case upgrade.
[155:38.48]Do I have anything to sell?
[155:42.86]Splendid up.
[155:43.84]Yeah, I can do it.
[155:44.26]I'll get the case upgrade.
[155:45.30]Alright.
[156:06.08]Did I get the knife upgrade?
[156:11.07]I think I really should.
[156:12.11]Maybe just all the way.
[156:18.28]I'll do a case upgrade.
[156:19.22]I'll do it too.
[156:23.78]Shit, I need a few bucks.
[156:30.60]Ruby's all rubbish.
[156:31.60]She makes no difference.
[156:33.34]The price?
[156:34.38]Well, that's our choice to make.
[156:46.99]Not bad.
[156:49.91]Thank you.
[156:53.79]All yours, stranger.
[156:54.95]Wield him.
[156:56.03]Come back any time.
[157:00.05]Much better.
[157:00.43]Can I do any of this?
[157:02.77]No.
[157:10.05]Sell the shells.
[157:12.75]Oh, welcome.
[157:13.87]That's true.
[157:14.87]I don't think I plan on doing shotgun.
[157:18.62]Pleasure doing business with you.
[157:22.00]I'll save the money.
[157:25.92]Thank you.
[157:27.44]What can I interest you in?
[157:31.11]Nope.
[157:31.63]Alright, let's go.
[157:47.64]Hey, what the fuck?
[158:08.16]I just got tripled.
[158:17.16]The grapple thing.
[158:18.62]Oh.
[158:18.74]My God.
[158:19.70]I beat the shit out of me.
[159:25.71]I won't work
[159:47.54]Why is your webcam like this?
[159:49.86]It's temporary.
[159:51.42]It's not where it's going to be.
[159:53.04]But I think it looks fine.
[159:54.11]You guys spend way too much time caring about the webcam angle.
[159:58.53]And you should be asking about how I just missed three headshots in a row.
[160:04.75]Those are the real questions you should be asking.
[160:18.87]How did you miss three headshots in a row?
[160:20.53]I don't... I don't... I don't... See?
[160:22.78]Isn't that better?
[160:23.20]That's much better.
[160:23.76]Okay, there is stuff here.
[160:33.51]Already got...
[160:51.06]Where is this jewel?
[160:58.13]In this house downstairs.
[161:11.70]No, it's in the other house.
[161:12.68]It's over there.
[161:28.02]There it is.
[161:32.18]Very cool.
[161:32.92]That's... Yep.
[161:36.90]Golden chicken egg.
[161:44.00]And this is a key that I don't have.
[161:45.24]Okay.
[161:48.74]I want to get all the treasures, so sorry, everybody.
[161:50.72]I know we might get bored, but I want to just go get them.
[161:54.08]Or at least the ones I can get.
[161:57.09]So I'm going to go into the town hall.
[162:05.24]Which is in the left.
[162:07.94]Left and then right.
[162:21.96]There we go.
[162:30.95]Okay.
[162:33.79]How do I get back into there?
[162:35.05]And why did I not get it when I was already over there?
[162:42.85]That's the most annoying part for me.
[162:50.04]Wasn't I just in there?
[163:02.30]Was I not?
[163:02.86]Apparently I wasn't.
[163:10.86]Oh, well.
[163:16.10]How long is the DLC?
[163:20.22]If you... I think it's like three to five hours.
[163:23.55]Something like that.
[163:25.25]Usually about two or four.
[163:26.29]Depending on who's playing it.
[163:29.29]And I'm playing it.
[163:32.14]Sooooooooooo...
[164:02.08]Two hours of speedrun time.
[164:12.04]I had a lot of health.
[164:22.23]Oh, that's why.
[164:22.95]Okay.
[164:34.23]Cool.
[164:38.41]I guess the best way to see how far I am right now is how many chapters are there?
[164:45.03]Six, I imagine.
[164:45.61]Probably five or six.
[164:46.67]Seven?
[164:58.78]Seven?
[164:59.24]Yeah.
[165:18.11]Everything loaded.
[165:18.79]Kind of.
[165:21.45]Alright.
[165:22.59]So, now I gotta get over here.
[165:24.05]What's the best way to get over there?
[165:30.37]From here?
[165:30.75]This way.
[165:33.43]Remember what time you were born?
[165:37.98]12.00 a.m.
[165:52.21]I don't know like.
[166:01.36]6.
[166:10.79]That's a grenade.
[166:21.61]It's a bouncy ball.
[166:23.39]You throw a bouncy ball at me.
[166:25.09]The bounce on that was fucking ridiculous.
[166:32.96]There's no reason why that should have bounced that high.
[166:54.52]Oh, I thought he went down into the thing, OK.
[167:18.84]Hello little.
[167:21.74]Hello little.
[167:29.11]Damn.
[167:37.92]You have an aura of a Looney Tunes physics character.
[167:46.36]I don't know.
[167:47.16]Something.
[168:02.19]Shit, the knife is broken.
[168:03.11]Shit, I thought I was far enough away.
[168:16.53]Am I damaging the knife when I swing at that?
[168:30.69]When I hit the grades in the ground.
[168:32.86]I actually might be.
[168:41.12]Now OK.
[168:51.54]Anything in there?
[169:02.71]Can't get up top.
[169:03.59]Hold on.
[169:18.66]Can't jump into one of those windows.
[169:22.59]Really?
[169:37.35]What kind of horseshit is that?
[169:56.02]Sell those.
[170:09.23]Somebody has a grenade somewhere.
[170:10.55]I love that you pulled apart your sectional for this stream.
[170:22.95]Oh, you mean?
[170:24.83]All of them going forward.
[170:31.75]It ain't just for this one, it's for the rest of them so.
[170:39.03]Professor X?
[170:44.31]It looks like Professor X's chair?
[170:54.22]Does it?
[170:58.19]What does the back of Professor X's chair look like?
[171:00.99]You are a popular one, Luis.
[171:26.01]Got seen.
[172:03.05]I thought that was a baby crying.
[172:08.97]Sorry, big guy.
[172:10.37]Can't let you go that way.
[172:17.64]Go go.
[172:22.54]OK, cool.
[172:26.87]Gonna destroy this ship.
[172:27.83]I throw a grenade his mouth.
[172:42.11]There's so many holes in his head.
[173:02.36]No!
[173:02.68]I was trying to jump onto the thing!
[173:21.99]Get on, get on!
[173:22.55]How do I get on?
[173:29.41]Cool.
[173:31.77]Cool.
[174:16.94]Oh, shit!
[174:22.23]Just get the fuck out of me.
[174:51.84]Is the game loud at all?
[174:52.92]Looks like it's kind of loud.
[174:58.70]I need to drop it by like 10%.
[174:59.64]Is this good?
[175:02.84]Okay.
[175:09.81]Looks like it's getting up kind of in the yellow.
[175:12.37]Sweet dreams.
[175:18.66]Now I'm just going to loot the whole thing because there's going to be a lot of items around, right?
[175:22.12]Usually there is.
[175:23.24]Hey.
[175:24.80]Got a smoke?
[175:26.71]I do.
[175:27.55]The kind you like.
[175:29.29]Now where's the Amber?
[175:31.55]Unfortunately, it's not on me at the moment.
[175:34.85]And you really should be telling me.
[175:37.75]What a good job I did.
[175:38.99]Didn't we just do this like an hour ago?
[175:40.75]I managed to hide it right before I got caught.
[175:44.76]Which is why I'm still alive.
[175:50.56]The deal was, we get you out of here when you deliver the Amber.
[175:55.02]No Amber, no protection, Louise.
[175:59.51]Such a stickler for details, huh, Ada?
[176:03.75]Okay, then.
[176:05.81]I'll go get it now.
[176:06.57]How about that?
[176:10.43]It's loud during fights, but quiet during cutscenes.
[176:13.70]Everything is up all the way.
[176:15.68]Maybe I should turn the...
[176:18.42]Effects down.
[176:19.40]Fine.
[176:19.68]Yeah, it's alright.
[176:27.08]Just leave it.
[176:47.16]Chapter four.
[177:06.08]I feel like if those things were real, you wouldn't... You would just fly into the air and just die.
[177:14.91]You would do the grapple hook and you'd be going 50, 60 miles per hour.
[177:19.67]You would just go straight into the air.
[177:21.77]Or straight into the fucking wall and smash your head.
[177:28.03]It would tear your arm off.
[177:29.71]You would dislocate your shoulder.
[177:31.63]Both shoulders if you had it with both hands.
[177:35.22]Before...
[177:38.49]This is not a negotiation, Louis, so choose your next words carefully.
[177:43.50]Whoa.
[177:45.72]Listen.
[177:47.22]There is someone who needs my help.
[177:50.40]You know me.
[177:52.16]Always the good Samaritan.
[177:54.70]Let me guess.
[177:56.04]Leon?
[177:57.84]Yes, exactly.
[177:59.68]Leon and that young woman, they are both infected.
[178:04.93]They need this medicine.
[178:06.35]It slows the infection.
[178:07.71]And I know it works.
[178:10.30]I used it.
[178:12.04]On myself.
[178:13.54]So... Why does this matter to me?
[178:17.12]Because you two are infected.
[178:18.32]That's what I researched for all these years, Ada.
[178:23.19]And I see the symptoms already showing in your eyes.
[178:27.87]You must already feel the effects, eh?
[178:34.36]The medicine will stop them for a time.
[178:37.38]Just trust me.
[178:39.72]You have a lot to gain, and nothing to lose.
[178:46.18]Okay, but this is your last chance.
[178:49.67]We do this first, and then the Amber.
[178:55.71]I'll let Leon know.
[179:02.03]Hola Luis here.
[179:03.47]Las Plagas is fucked.
[179:05.57]Imagine getting like, imagine seeing one.
[179:09.99]Perfect because I have a present I want to give you.
[179:12.71]Medicine that will help you suppress the progress of your problem.
[179:16.15]Where do we go?
[179:16.63]I can't imagine having to like see one.
[179:20.60]Come to the courtyard.
[179:21.60]Who is this guy?
[179:23.02]Come meet up there.
[179:24.34]Ciao.
[179:28.00]Sorry to keep you waiting.
[179:29.92]Shall we?
[179:36.26]I didn't even look if there's any items in the room.
[179:43.94]Where did he go?
[179:44.50]I was like, what?
[180:05.11]Shut up.
[180:05.31]I don't care about a laboratory.
[180:06.21]We're not going there.
[180:07.97]We're not going there.
[180:08.91]I don't want to go there.
[180:10.17]We're not going there.
[180:33.50]Just wait until Resident Evil 30 when you get to pick the path you want to go on.
[180:40.04]Do you want to go to the lab?
[180:41.82]Highlight left.
[180:42.90]Do you want to go to the church?
[180:44.60]Highlight right.
[180:56.10]And the whole time when you're making your decision, whatever character is in the cutscene does this.
[181:06.92]Which way do you want to go?
[181:07.76]Hey, we don't go out all day.
[181:17.05]I fucked up the line.
[181:18.25]I can't.
[181:18.95]Sorry.
[181:20.83]All I hear in my head is beep, beep.
[181:24.67]Like a fucking microwave.
[181:26.09]The food is done.
[181:27.73]I screwed it up so bad.
[181:33.53]What was I hearing?
[181:37.66]Was I hearing this?
[181:42.44]What?
[181:42.84]Wait, what?
[181:45.20]Are you making fucking popcorn up here?
[181:56.00]Where'd he go?
[181:57.16]Oh shit.
[181:57.62]This is what I get for not paying attention.
[182:15.88]That was funny.
[182:18.44]Who else is in the room?
[182:19.30]That was a Bugleberry voice.
[182:22.67]That was an, oh yeah.
[182:58.65]No, no, no, no.
[183:11.19]Not yet.
[183:22.84]I want...
[183:28.92]I want apple cake.
[183:32.62]I want apple cake.
[183:33.70]You've been fighting this one guy down here for so long.
[183:43.77]How many bullets did you shoot into this guy?
[183:45.73]A lot.
[183:49.62]I want apple cake.
[183:53.98]I think three of you are going to know what that's from.
[184:15.61]Monster Rancher too.
[184:21.75]I want apple cake.
[184:24.89]I need to heal.
[184:25.56]Should I just take the golden egg?
[184:29.74]No, it's worth a lot of money.
[184:42.05]He's dying.
[184:50.18]What's wrong with him?
[184:59.27]Why is she running so weird?
[185:02.97]Don't inhale the smoke.
[185:09.01]Oh, he's fucking dead.
[185:10.81]He's dead like in five seconds.
[185:28.75]I want apple cake.
[185:50.17]Louise, get back here.
[185:55.39]Don't inhale the smoke.
[185:56.37]It's like he's breathing in as hard as he can.
[186:12.49]Just don't breathe forehead.
[186:16.69]That's right.
[186:31.17]If you're trying to kill yourself, can you do it AFTER you've delivered the Amber?
[186:36.58]It's all gone... ...burnt to nothing.
[186:41.10]Why is this so important to you?
[186:43.60]There are things... ...I MUST set right... ...but that is impossible now.
[186:50.87]It's all over... ...and I can't help them anymore.
[186:56.98]Pull yourself together, Luis.
[186:59.56]Nice hamster step.
[187:00.46]Shut up.
[187:02.16]You know how, just do it.
[187:06.30]Yes, it is possible.
[187:10.80]The ingredients are out here, in the castle.
[187:15.46]Yes, I need time, but I can still get you, your emperor.
[187:21.21]Alright then, let's go.
[187:26.00]How many times have I said shut up today?
[187:28.01]At least five.
[187:30.97]I'm just kidding though, don't worry.
[187:37.95]Where am I?
[187:39.91]Maybe not.
[187:42.61]Is it at least more than one?
[187:43.63]Maybe not.
[187:46.13]Alright, I got the item.
[187:49.53]Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on.
[187:52.59]Slow down.
[188:14.98]He'd rather be doing anything else right now.
[188:18.04]That's not true.
[188:19.06]This is fun.
[188:20.12]I'm having a great time.
[188:21.52]What do you want about?
[188:23.26]I'm not bored.
[188:23.80]You guys are mistaking relaxed with bored.
[188:25.76]Boomer facecam gameplay.
[188:26.72]Yeah.
[188:27.81]This is how it is now.
[188:44.67]Sorry, the way it is now.
[188:51.32]I think I'm having to join myself immensely right now.
[188:55.22]This is wonderful.
[189:02.26]Oh yeah, I'll unlock the.
[189:06.56]Where's the key?
[189:07.66]You should be able to use the swords.
[189:10.90]I must have dropped it.
[189:33.02]You need a blankie.
[189:35.62]Up here.
[189:38.60]All the way up to my neck.
[189:40.82]The bottom of my neck.
[189:43.26]And one of those goofy hats.
[189:46.44]Way too hot to do that.
[189:52.02]Not right now.
[189:54.90]Maybe during the winter time it'd be funny to do that.
[189:57.68]Look like an asshole for a little bit.
[190:01.74]Alright, we need red ink, gold bottle, blue butterfly.
[190:06.11]Okay.
[190:13.06]They're probably just on the map.
[190:15.74]They are.
[190:16.42]Whoa, there's a lot of shit in here.
[190:19.66]Okay.
[190:21.05]This is where we parked.
[190:33.51]Any of this stuff in here?
[190:42.30]Not really.
[190:43.06]Can you summarize the plot in five seconds or less?
[190:57.43]Bugs get into your brain and control you and Wesker has a vial, but it keeps going like this.
[191:06.34]I think that sums it up pretty well.
[191:11.94]Alright, first the bindery.
[191:26.97]to this part.
[191:28.17]Alright, let me take a quick look.
[191:32.37]Nothing really in here, so I'm not going to fuck with that.
[191:43.00]Hmm.
[191:44.20]A raccoon.
[191:46.44]Guess this is fate.
[192:01.88]Oh hey.
[192:05.43]Lithographic stone.
[192:14.13]Stone.
[192:18.30]Somebody is subs $5 a month for me to say that every time.
[192:22.00]I just want to make sure.
[192:23.70]Somebody pays $5 a month for me to do that.
[192:34.43]Does this thing max out?
[192:35.25]Does this have a maximum?
[192:36.51]Or no?
[192:37.11]Later.
[193:09.69]I'll buy almost anything.
[193:16.90]Not bad.
[193:20.60]Red 9.
[193:21.40]I don't really necessarily care.
[193:23.86]I don't always have this in stock, stranger.
[193:31.57]Minus one gunpowder when you use my crafting.
[193:35.09]That's kind of good.
[193:36.33]Actually, I should get that.
[193:39.05]Remind me that that's there.
[193:40.03]Gunpowder.
[193:40.61]That's the worst.
[193:41.85]That's the worst charm.
[193:54.09]Didn't seem that bad.
[194:13.45]Uh, do I just put a bunch of these away?
[194:15.43]Dude, green weed laughing my ass off.
[194:45.22]Holy shit.
[194:49.00]Mod that guy or ban that guy.
[194:55.97]Okay.
[194:56.99]I got it saved.
[194:57.91]I'm a compulsive saver.
[194:59.75]I'm going to do it again.
[195:09.03]And let's continue.
[195:20.05]Free needle.
[195:22.61]Brainstorm.
[195:24.64]Free needle.
[195:49.10]I just repaired this thing that's already broken.
[196:02.07]Incoming puzzle.
[196:05.66]Fuck.
[196:14.28]Not yet.
[196:19.01]oh yeah okay puzzle time puzzle time alright that's a uh that's a fan
[196:56.10]This bird doesn't match.
[196:57.50]Maybe, no, maybe it does.
[196:58.98]Um, so what's, um... You already did this one in normal mode.
[197:03.47]Okay.
[197:08.30]Uh, hear me out for a second.
[197:11.37]Yesterday, when you watched the Resident Evil 4 playthrough that I did.
[197:15.97]And you watched this part.
[197:19.53]And today, I'm streaming this.
[197:22.39]You have to remember, that was recorded probably four and a half months ago.
[197:28.86]So you got it right there, and here you are one day later.
[197:33.50]So I just did this.
[197:35.28]I just did it on your screen.
[197:36.94]It's been a while.
[197:44.17]Why is everybody doing the smiley face?
[197:45.27]Why does my hair look so bad?
[197:52.08]It looks like there's a joke under here.
[197:53.52]It looks like I'm about to lift this up and there's gonna be like an animal under it.
[198:03.02]I look like fucking Edgar Allan Poe!
[198:06.87]Do I?
[198:12.75]Holy shit.
[198:14.55]That's kind of cool.
[198:15.87]Alright, I'm gonna rock it.
[198:16.93]I'm gonna rock with that.
[198:17.73]Alright, um... What was the point I was making?
[198:23.90]Oh yeah, I don't remember.
[198:25.18]It's been a while.
[198:26.04]It's been like two days.
[198:49.19]Bird on the left.
[198:50.41]And there needs to be a square up here.
[198:51.79]I mean, there's only so many combinations this could be, right?
[198:59.44]What's going on here?
[199:03.52]Doesn't this look correct?
[199:16.10]I'm biting my lip.
[199:17.46]Mm-mm.
[199:17.94]Mm-mm.
[199:18.95]Hmm.
[199:40.50]I just don't remember.
[199:44.01]I need another orange one, don't I?
[199:45.89]Is there another one in the room that I'm just missing?
[199:52.98]Mm-hmm.
[200:29.07]What the fuck am I doing wrong here?
[200:41.28]What the heck, I'm subbed to this dork?
[200:44.26]Oh.
[200:54.56]the heck's happening here obviously this needs to be a square this needs to be a I don't what I'm like I feel like I'm missing a piece I guess not
[201:26.95]What the hell am I doing wrong?
[201:28.22]There's only so many, there's only like, what, 16 combinations?
[201:32.11]There's only like 20 combinations this could be.
[201:54.39]I am munching on my lip and I gotta stop.
[201:56.83]Hold on.
[202:00.66]True.
[202:03.68]When a puzzle comes up, I just start tearing into my bottom lip.
[202:08.90]Dorito goes into the wind.
[202:22.73]Wait a minute.
[202:28.89]So you would need the bird needs wind.
[202:30.81]The the dress needs a bird and the.
[202:45.44]The bird needs wind.
[202:46.40]The bird needs that.
[202:55.35]I actually don't know.
[202:56.07]I have no idea.
[202:58.09]This shouldn't be this hard, but I'm playing checkers when you need to play.
[203:03.78]I'm playing chess when you need to play, like, hopscotch.
[203:07.94]It's not even hard.
[203:11.16]I'm saying cheese, cheese, Dorito.
[203:12.62]Cheese, cheese, cheese, Dorito, Dorito.
[203:14.26]Illuminati symbol.
[203:21.05]Tornado.
[203:22.07]Tornado.
[203:23.19]Tornado needs...
[203:26.49]A weather.
[203:27.65]It's bad weather.
[203:28.57]It's... I'm playing Pictionary again.
[203:36.39]Like, one of these has to be down here or here.
[203:41.17]What am I missing?
[203:41.78]What's happening to me?
[203:48.64]Burrito sugar.
[203:49.38]Yeah.
[203:50.52]Stinky cheese.
[203:52.30]No sloth.
[204:04.51]I feel like I've done every single combination you could possibly do.
[204:31.05]Um...
[204:33.37]I don't do puzzles.
[204:34.07]I do pit cross and that's it.
[204:37.13]I just know how to run wicked fast for like five seconds.
[204:40.61]And like, I like, I, I, I don't know.
[204:42.61]I don't get it.
[204:45.35]How many combinations can it possibly be that I haven't done?
[204:48.69]Umbrellas, dress, and bird.
[204:51.93]And I did this four months ago.
[204:53.76]A person is watching the video of me saying the same shit right now.
[204:58.39]Pull it up.
[204:59.29]I'm saying the exact same.
[205:00.27]You know what?
[205:00.69]How about we just pull the video up when I'm doing it and I'll just ask myself.
[205:03.90]I will talk to myself.
[205:04.64]I don't even know where it is.
[205:12.12]That's a whole can of worms.
[205:13.69]I don't even know what timestamp it is.
[205:18.67]What's the timestamp on the VOD?
[205:20.73]Can a mod link the VOD with the timestamp?
[205:31.11]I need to open the... I need to have mod chat open.
[205:48.00]Yeah, okay, I got it open now.
[205:58.99]Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait, wait.
[206:00.03]Hold on, hold on, hold on.
[206:19.83]Hold on.
[206:20.17]Hold on.
[206:20.47]Hold on.
[206:20.73]Hold on.
[206:21.01]Hold on.
[206:21.29]Hold on.
[206:21.71]Hold on.
[206:22.07]Hold on.
[206:59.55]You just don't know.
[207:00.20]You don't know.
[207:00.64]Give me a sec.
[207:05.30]Let me ask.
[207:05.74]Let me ask me from like four months ago.
[207:30.49]Did someone find it?
[207:31.63]I don't think so.
[207:34.09]It's like three streams.
[207:38.39]I just don't get it.
[207:40.67]It's going to be so obvious, but I just don't care.
[207:45.32]Do you know what I mean?
[207:46.26]I would just throw a grenade at this wall.
[207:48.92]You know what?
[207:49.40]I would just call somebody.
[207:50.98]I would be like, hey, Wesker.
[207:52.74]What's up?
[207:53.18]Hey, what's up, dude?
[207:54.26]I'm sitting at a wall.
[207:54.98]Look, I'm the guy that runs fast, and you keep me around because I tell jokes, and I'm a writer.
[208:02.18]I'd be dead in a minute, by the way.
[208:04.60]Oh, you're a writer.
[208:06.36]You write jokes.
[208:08.33]I don't fucking need you at all, actually.
[208:11.25]I don't need a writer.
[208:18.46]What do you want?
[208:19.73]Alright, so I'm looking at this thing right now Wesker.
[208:22.41]There's a bird and there's a cut off symbol.
[208:26.11]There's a cut off bird.
[208:27.13]There's a fan at the top.
[208:30.16]And that's orange.
[208:30.98]The bird and the fan are both orange and this fan has a square on it.
[208:38.17]okay okay are you with me here so far on the right there is a a dress in a hexagon shape dress what kind of dress is it it's it's got one of those poofy dresses from like the 1400s or something a poofy 1400s dress yes that that's exactly it the ones that like they have like big cage in them yes yes yes yes yes the big ones okay I got that down
[209:01.68]Okay, then the bottom, this memory source has two umbrellas.
[209:03.82]So there's a second umbrella at the bottom with a hexagon as well.
[209:06.12]Regular umbrella, just like one of those umbrellas.
[209:08.80]It's got like frills on it.
[209:09.82]Frilly umbrella, also from the 1400s.
[209:11.60]Yes, actually yes.
[209:13.60]Okay, so let me think here.
[209:16.53]So what I think is, and there's four slots.
[209:18.93]There are four slots.
[209:21.15]Okay.
[209:30.99]Okay.
[209:33.56]Uh, let him out.
[209:34.06]I don't care.
[209:35.00]Just let him out.
[209:35.56]Just tell me what to do.
[209:36.26]I don't care.
[209:39.20]I don't care.
[209:40.54]Just tell me what it is.
[209:42.72]We can do it together.
[209:43.72]It's fun that way.
[209:44.42]We're doing it together.
[209:45.86]We're gonna do it together.
[209:48.38]Yeah, see chat?
[209:49.28]We're hanging out.
[209:49.92]We're doing it together.
[209:54.02]Rotate them?
[209:54.68]What do you mean, rotate them?
[210:16.76]Okay, listen.
[210:18.48]You have to understand.
[210:25.60]I thought that was telling me that I could move them.
[210:29.00]The Q and the E were not rotating in my brain.
[210:36.46]Wow.
[210:37.80]Shit.
[210:38.74]Oh, that's on the internet now.
[210:40.00]Do you know what I mean?
[210:41.30]That's on the internet now forever.
[210:49.31]I'm sitting kind of far away from the screen.
[210:51.25]It's a different setup.
[210:53.59]To me, the rotate was not there.
[210:57.22]Oh my god.
[210:59.12]I can't believe it.
[211:06.23]I'm not pretending at all.
[211:08.47]At all.
[211:10.00]Zero pretending.
[211:11.70]Absolute zero.
[211:13.62]I was just so lasered.
[211:15.64]I don't even know how I was so lasered.
[211:17.96]That's the worst moment ever.
[211:21.62]You don't have the attention span for directions.
[211:26.53]That's probably the worst ever.
[211:30.01]Ever.
[211:31.27]In 15 years of doing this.
[211:34.54]I just had to go like this.
[211:38.70]And I don't have an excuse for you.
[211:41.48]I really don't.
[211:42.49]My only excuse is... I can see it now.
[211:47.85]It's just ADHD.
[211:49.61]That's the only excuse.
[211:51.69]That's it.
[211:53.21]I can't tell you another reason why.
[211:55.37]I genuinely could not tell you another reason why.
[211:58.79]Because I, my brain, the Q and the E were not on the screen.
[212:05.49]They were just not on screen.
[212:06.85]They were gone.
[212:07.23]They weren't there until you brought that up.
[212:09.55]That's crazy.
[212:10.45]What a fucking case study.
[212:13.39]That's an unbelievable case study for ADHD because wowie, you just watched it.
[212:21.72]Did I do it in the last one too?
[212:24.24]We got the timestamp for the last one.
[212:25.56]Did I do it in the last one?
[212:31.40]Glasses in the cutscene.
[212:32.28]Yeah, they really are just ruining everything.
[212:34.11]Alright, this is the maze part, isn't it?
[212:50.95]My name is Maze.
[212:56.05]You can tell what game I was playing six months ago.
[212:59.66]Oh my fucking god.
[213:08.11]I can't believe I didn't see it.
[213:09.59]How?
[213:19.87]I do it again.
[213:20.47]I do it again.
[213:21.15]I do it again.
[213:21.97]It happens back here too.
[213:23.89]I don't rotate it.
[213:24.61]Guys, we're talking about this is consistency.
[213:27.31]It's consistency.
[213:31.38]It is absolute consistency.
[213:33.14]I haven't spun them once.
[213:38.00]I think I'm... Am I missing one?
[213:41.22]Let's just listen to them for a little while.
[213:52.05]Oh wait, you can flip them.
[213:53.23]Oops.
[213:56.27]Took him a lot quicker.
[213:58.25]Hey, I'm retired now.
[213:59.10]It's alright.
[214:05.92]OK, well.
[214:12.96]It's been sure been fun.
[214:18.00]Alright, so this goes here.
[214:20.63]This goes here and.
[214:24.64]This needs to be a square.
[214:26.71]Where is the?
[214:27.51]Where is that?
[215:08.86]I can't tell you what just happened there.
[215:17.13]The only thing I can attribute it to is sitting in this new room and being like this.
[215:23.18]That's it.
[215:23.48]Oh well.
[215:24.56]Oh well.
[215:27.72]Oh well.
[215:36.28]Hey, the mod chat, how could you let me fucking do it?
[215:38.94]You should have said, rotate the fucking cubes, man.
[215:41.02]I should have looked over and it should have been like, hey, rotate the fucking cubes already.
[215:45.48]You should have gave me some extra fucking direction.
[215:50.28]Wait.
[215:52.28]Did they?
[215:58.10]No, they didn't.
[215:58.70]No, they didn't.
[216:03.51]Okay, let's go.
[216:20.48]Touch it.
[216:25.22]Ooh, I get to do the shooting thing.
[216:30.40]Is that in this?
[216:41.48]You're sitting too far away.
[216:43.24]That actually might be what happened.
[216:44.89]And I know, you know, streamer dumb.
[216:47.03]I know, I know.
[216:47.99]But I think that's probably why I didn't see it.
[216:51.66]I was moving him too quickly and I, you know, I'm not gonna give excuses anymore.
[216:55.24]That was really stupid.
[216:58.30]Oh well.
[216:59.46]Okay.
[217:06.63]Watch your eyes.
[217:08.89]He's too, he's too comfortable.
[217:21.44]I think my brain saw them as like A and D. To like move them.
[217:26.42]Not rotate.
[217:28.62]Okay.
[217:28.86]Let me stop giving excuses to why that just happened and play the game.
[217:41.50]Okay.
[217:43.20]So where is it?
[217:45.91]Red ink or blue ink or something?
[217:47.41]Where is it?
[217:56.98]Okay.
[217:57.32]Yeah, yeah, yeah.
[217:58.18]Get shooting.
[217:59.18]So... Shoot the shields?
[218:04.46]Who has a shield?
[218:05.20]Okay.
[218:11.49]So... What's the order?
[218:15.91]One, two, three, four.
[218:18.07]One, two, three, four.
[218:28.07]That not correct.
[218:31.95]Alright, wait, wait, wait, hold on zoom it in.
[218:33.21]Hold on, let me get fucking close.
[218:38.71]Let me go.
[218:39.25]Let me get close.
[218:43.36]One.
[218:49.80]One is.
[219:12.50]So wait, it's.
[219:16.36]What is it?
[219:16.80]It's one.
[219:19.22]One.
[219:23.00]Hold on.
[219:29.70]123 is that right?
[219:32.88]123.
[219:39.17]No, it's the way that they're on the wall.
[219:42.79]Where the fuck is this one?
[219:48.40]What is that?
[220:05.32]Look around.
[220:08.18]Oh Jesus, OK, there's other ones.
[220:21.75]Okay, so that was... This is it here.
[220:26.49]So that's the right one over here.
[220:27.87]And then it's one... Where is this?
[220:35.10]That's... Okay, that's like an elk.
[220:38.32]Elk?
[220:38.72]Elk?
[220:40.60]Lady?
[220:40.82]Little lady?
[220:42.54]Lady?
[220:44.25]Alright, so where's the, where's the elk?
[220:46.49]What do you mean bro?
[220:47.25]What?
[220:50.97]Does that even matter or you just shoot it in the right direction?
[220:53.55]1, 2, 3, like this?
[220:54.61]Am I playing chess again?
[220:55.86]I don't know.
[221:00.14]Hold on.
[221:02.82]Did I have it right when I spun it?
[221:03.88]1, 2, yeah, OK, spin it.
[221:06.72]1, 2, 3, 4.
[221:21.05]Is that not right?
[221:23.25]There's no way.
[221:27.16]Well, I flipped it though, right?
[221:30.62]You're playing Battleship on a chessboard.
[221:35.19]I'm laughing so hard right now.
[221:55.52]Well, that's the correct one.
[222:00.22]One, two, three.
[222:10.63]One, two.
[222:12.05]I gotta do it upside down.
[222:15.01]One, two, three.
[222:22.78]Why is he flipping it?
[222:28.35]I must be fucking tired.
[222:29.73]Am I like sleepy?
[222:31.67]Holy shit, I am like 40.
[222:34.63]OK.
[222:34.85]One, one, two, three.
[223:02.32]Jesus.
[223:03.02]I gotta get my fucking eyes examined.
[223:06.68]Holy shit.
[223:09.96]Oh my god.
[223:10.94]I'm like too comfortable.
[223:16.33]Jesus.
[223:23.09]That was 15 minutes.
[223:26.07]Dude, is there carbon monoxide going into your room?
[223:32.69]Jeez, man.
[223:34.18]That was fucking ridiculous.
[223:39.42]You can stop right there, Leon.
[223:46.86]Would it make me use this?
[223:49.16]Would you?
[223:51.28]Well, after six years, that is one hell of a greeting, Ada.
[223:57.03]You don't seem surprised.
[224:00.11]Interesting.
[224:08.21]Try using knives next time.
[224:10.41]Better for close encounters.
[224:13.27]Not a bad move.
[224:15.53]Very smooth.
[224:17.53]So who are you working for this time?
[224:19.98]Oh, Leon.
[224:21.92]You know I don't work in town.
[224:30.92]Leave the girl.
[224:32.66]She's lost no matter what.
[224:36.20]You walk away now, and who knows?
[224:39.52]Maybe you'll live to meet me again.
[224:41.06]And then I might get you that greeting you were looking for.
[224:45.65]Change the outfit?
[224:46.87]I can't.
[224:47.39]I have to keep it like this.
[224:48.21]It's too good.
[224:51.97]Right.
[224:54.92]How about we continue this discussion another time?
[225:15.29]He looks like Jerry Seinfeld.
[225:24.26]Okay.
[225:25.84]Let's go.
[225:41.51]Do I have any of the fun hats for Leon?
[225:55.24]Okay, so there is another thing down here.
[226:01.86]Let's go.
[226:19.73]The gate and gong have the same sense.
[226:23.12]Seems simple enough.
[226:26.22]Alright, snakes.
[226:26.86]This is a snake right here, right?
[226:37.04]Is it just shoot snake twice?
[226:41.57]Is there another snake?
[226:42.59]There is.
[226:48.39]You should bedazzle the recliner.
[227:07.57]I've got a bad feeling.
[227:10.97]No, not this shit.
[227:15.47]Turn and run.
[227:16.02]What the fuck?
[227:25.18]Open the door.
[227:50.17]Um, oh.
[227:54.97]Need to wear your glasses.
[227:57.47]I think it's a combination of visual distance and ADHD object permanence.
[228:08.22]Like in my brain right now, I can say, hey, that's an elk right there.
[228:11.02]And when I turn around, it's an elephant.
[228:13.30]It's gone.
[228:16.14]Well.
[228:30.12]No, I have a detector.
[228:32.06]You're making me think for a second.
[228:33.19]You're like, oh, I'm like, oh, shit.
[228:40.59]Being high doesn't help?
[228:42.19]Yeah, that's true.
[228:42.97]Give me these jewels.
[228:47.27]I want it.
[228:59.50]Looks like.
[229:02.24]Something goes here.
[229:14.38]OK.
[229:18.36]A trap.
[229:23.21]Oh shit, some of these guys.
[230:11.50]Bottle.
[230:11.76]I'm probably going to have to pick that up again.
[230:16.36]I'm imagining.
[230:17.22]More stuff.
[230:41.38]No key, what?
[231:20.25]Yeah.
[231:20.91]Okay, gold bottle.
[231:43.23]Oh my goodness.
[232:02.80]Okay.
[232:03.40]Oh boy.
[232:10.87]Whoa!
[232:11.49]What just hit me?
[232:22.39]Ooh!
[232:37.98]I must have bullets.
[232:39.67]Oh, you piece of shit.
[232:40.59]Leave me alone.
[232:58.08]Come here.
[232:58.44]Come here.
[232:58.66]Come here.
[232:58.90]Come here.
[233:11.20]Oh my God.
[233:11.88]You little shits over there.
[233:13.34]Leave me alone.
[233:14.00]Okay.
[233:41.07]We're good.
[233:42.49]Hold me.
[233:43.19]Hold me.
[233:46.90]Now I get a minute.
[233:47.52]Let me... There's jewels in here.
[234:09.53]Okay, so I have both the bottles.
[234:11.20]Do I want to do anything else in this room or no?
[234:15.30]I don't think so.
[234:33.22]Do I have a favorite gem?
[234:35.88]Um... Probably birthstone.
[234:39.27]That's the easy answer.
[234:53.78]Hmm.
[235:16.63]The Stone of Birth.
[235:23.79]Should I go back and check for that treasure?
[235:27.21]I feel like I should.
[235:29.62]But... I think it's a key.
[235:36.46]I think it's a key.
[235:43.12]I don't think I have a key to open it.
[235:46.52]But... I need the gold bottle.
[235:50.28]I need to keep the gold bottle, so I'm not leaving that.
[235:53.44]There are blue medallions here.
[236:05.53]Okay, out there.
[236:15.61]Welcome where would it?
[236:17.65]What can I do you for?
[236:22.03]Your valuables won't do you much good.
[236:24.79]There's no inputs on these.
[236:25.87]I guess not a deal well struck.
[236:40.63]Thank you.
[236:41.23]Alright, I want what I want to do here.
[236:50.96]Full knife.
[236:51.36]Okay.
[236:52.51]Hmm.
[236:52.85]Hmm.
[237:21.52]Is there another knife that I find later?
[237:25.86]Ignore the whole DLC tonight.
[237:28.61]Probably.
[237:29.49]Yeah.
[237:32.96]Probably.
[237:49.69]Yeah, it's a luck draw.
[237:51.71]Alright, the last.
[237:54.77]One is over way up here.
[237:57.19]So I'm going to go through the courtyard.
[238:00.79]I want that wherever that is.
[238:10.25]OK, Louise, that's 2.
[238:12.55]Last one should be in the room accessible from the castle wall.
[238:15.86]You bring them all to the top of the wall.
[238:21.71]Okay.
[238:38.92]Reload everything.
[238:40.10]And where are the medallions?
[238:43.86]Can I jump this?
[238:46.12]I don't need to jump it.
[238:47.03]It's just right here.
[238:53.83]Okay, that was easy.
[238:54.41]Alright, let's go medallion hunting.
[239:10.48]Oh, wait, there are fishes in there, aren't there?
[239:14.61]Does that work?
[239:17.81]Oh, it does, probably.
[239:18.93]This is just health, right?
[239:47.13]Wait a minute, something over here.
[240:09.77]I think that's it.
[240:22.78]Yep.
[240:25.60]Turn on your real face again.
[240:26.86]Well, you don't like my my made up one.
[240:31.90]Like a weird mustache.
[240:42.95]Alright, there's there's only actually one treasure in here.
[240:47.65]Interesting.
[240:56.43]Now, where are the others?
[241:00.53]Oh, goddammit.
[241:07.92]Couldn't just let me through, could you?
[241:09.52]Don't kill him!
[241:38.64]Oh, he felt he didn't have to do anything.
[241:40.08]Shut up.
[241:44.76]Yeah.
[241:46.59]After a grenade in there.
[241:57.39]I think I got him.
[241:58.47]I got stuff.
[241:59.11]Oh my goodness run.
[242:10.34]Okay, you are dead.
[242:12.10]Thank goodness.
[242:14.02]Oh, what's this?
[242:42.36]This thing does not do a whole lot of damage without any upgrades.
[242:44.95]Okay.
[243:12.56]I want that.
[243:14.90]So you better believe I'm going to go get it.
[243:29.52]How do I get over here?
[243:41.81]Is it a chest?
[243:46.20]It is.
[243:46.94]I think I have enough to upgrade to.
[244:07.53]Oh, not good, not good, not good, not good, not good.
[244:34.08]Okay.
[244:34.70]That was ridiculous.
[244:37.60]Bro, you are fucking gaming.
[244:39.80]I am.
[244:47.46]Okay.
[244:48.32]So... One up here.
[244:50.38]One over here.
[244:59.12]I don't think there's any more treasure.
[245:00.50]Hold on.
[245:02.94]Let me go up here.
[245:15.31]I could just go over there.
[245:21.61]Where's this one?
[245:25.11]Is it in the building?
[245:32.44]I like the stash.
[245:34.38]I don't know how long it's going to be here for.
[245:43.74]It will only be here as long as it'll be here for enough time.
[245:51.03]Enough time.
[245:57.45]Where is this thing?
[245:58.21]It's like in that building.
[246:20.67]How do I get in this building?
[246:21.91]No.
[246:28.07]No.
[246:52.24]Oh, there we go.
[246:52.66]Okay, it's in here, right?
[247:04.52]No, it's not.
[247:05.30]Where is it?
[247:07.03]Where is it?
[247:11.05]Did I run by it like three times?
[247:17.27]Ah, okay, there it is.
[247:21.12]Last one is in the corner.
[247:33.84]Is it just right up here?
[247:36.81]You look like one of the weasels from Roger Rabbit.
[247:38.77]That's awesome.
[247:39.51]I'm so glad you just said that.
[247:45.07]That's who I am.
[247:49.32]As legitimately who I am as a person.
[247:52.73]All of them combined.
[247:53.87]I feel like I embody every single one of those characters together.
[247:58.13]As one.
[247:58.83]As one unit.
[248:02.89]Alright.
[248:05.13]So I can turn... I'll turn it in later.
[248:07.03]So now I gotta go through here.
[248:18.37]Can I get them from this way?
[248:32.60]Egg?
[248:33.18]Oh, it's a leaf.
[248:33.90]Alright, reload this thing.
[248:45.89]What an egomaniac.
[248:48.77]Um... They all die... They all die at the end of the movie, by the way.
[248:56.05]I just want to make sure you're aware of that.
[248:57.25]Like, they all die.
[249:00.01]What do you mean, bro?
[249:03.43]What do you mean, what?
[249:07.82]Spoiled?
[249:08.28]Spoilers?
[249:09.66]Did I not say spoilers?
[249:10.88]It's the movie's 40 years old.
[249:14.25]And I'm making that up too.
[249:15.13]They don't all die.
[249:19.15]I thought that was required reading for the stream already.
[249:23.07]Oh, I thought we already all seen it already a million times.
[249:26.45]Sorry about that.
[249:27.05]It's like one part of the movie.
[249:29.59]Don't worry.
[249:32.40]That was summer homework.
[249:33.30]Well, that was summer homework in like 2019.
[249:35.22]I thought we had all seen it already.
[249:39.62]I think we all have.
[249:53.06]okay I love that movie I think this mostly you've already seen it I'd say majority probably alright ones in chat if you have not seen Roger rabbit I feel like you there's no way that many of you haven't seen it no way really
[250:31.21]No treasures?
[250:31.71]What?
[251:01.18]I did not mean to press that.
[251:09.03]That sound.
[251:10.55]That's right.
[251:12.19]I still have some unfinished business to take care of.
[251:18.55]Did I not kill the thing?
[251:21.91]Thought I did.
[251:27.00]Nothing there.
[251:27.88]OK, grab this.
[251:34.69]Somebody's on the phone.
[251:42.43]So, what's become of the Amber?
[251:46.42]Sorry, nothing yet.
[251:48.98]But my little helper is creating quite the commotion.
[251:53.04]I have a little helper?
[251:54.84]Everything will work out just fine.
[251:57.06]As long as you can keep your dog under control.
[252:01.56]Louis.
[252:03.14]Predictable.
[252:05.85]This is Leon.
[252:06.57]Yeah, Lewis.
[252:10.74]What's that guy's name again?
[252:11.54]Lewis?
[252:23.30]Jesus.
[252:29.79]Leon, changed your mind yet?
[252:31.61]Yeah.
[252:33.21]Assuming you haven't.
[252:34.81]I've got a tip for you.
[252:36.96]Seems like something big is about to go down in the throne room.
[252:40.18]Babysitting's tough, huh?
[252:41.30]Hey, it's me, Wesker, again.
[252:45.08]You know that anybody can go on a channel and hear anything across a fucking walkie-talkie.
[252:50.21]Just wanted to make sure you understood that.
[252:54.35]Wesker, out.
[252:59.98]Okay, I am going to go this way.
[253:02.12]Wait, I'm going to go this way actually.
[253:03.55]Because I want to go... Should I get this treasure?
[253:05.93]Yes.
[253:06.11]Thanks for answering my question.
[253:35.43]Uh, it's down even further.
[253:51.52]Got ya.
[253:52.82]What are your tips on growing a mustache?
[253:54.29]I cannot give you any because I grow a terrible mustache.
[253:58.75]I've heard you have to just stick with it.
[254:01.59]But even if I stick with it for a month or two, it looks like a bird shit on the top of my lip.
[254:08.75]So it's... I don't know if I have any tips for you.
[254:18.96]Alright.
[254:19.56]Let's go.
[254:36.71]Checking up here.
[254:38.87]I will check below, but not yet.
[254:52.82]Now I'll go below.
[255:09.63]Alright, so this one will open if I do that again.
[255:11.33]Where you going?
[255:14.65]It's not gonna happen.
[255:25.24]You would fit in well in an American Civil War teledrama.
[255:45.49]It's an evil mustache.
[255:47.12]It is kind of evil.
[255:49.32]It's alright.
[256:10.31]OK.
[256:11.67]So that is closed.
[256:13.09]We need to wait.
[256:13.99]Is it today?
[256:14.55]Anything else back here?
[256:15.37]Was there another like?
[256:17.15]Sun or anything?
[256:18.91]No.
[256:19.05]I'll just open it again.
[256:23.74]Actually, wait.
[256:24.30]I want to go down here.
[256:27.16]Because.
[256:30.42]I feel like I. I missed something in here.
[256:39.42]No, it's the next room, OK?
[256:40.58]Alright, so if I go up here.
[256:53.48]I think I just get back up.
[256:57.12]I don't really need to do that again, do I?
[256:59.94]Go back up.
[257:06.69]Nothing else, right?
[257:10.71]You're like a hamster running around here.
[257:14.05]Yeah.
[257:27.65]Nothing.
[257:35.86]Wait, did I not?
[257:40.37]Wait a minute.
[257:40.77]I didn't go over here.
[257:47.08]A yellow diamond.
[257:50.52]Nice.
[257:50.86]Blue butterfly.
[258:11.63]It's a puzzle.
[258:11.97]Pay attention.
[258:12.63]Okay.
[258:42.42]Alright, order.
[258:43.36]Okay, so the butterflies have to be in a certain order.
[258:52.17]Put it on emote only.
[258:53.29]Yeah, I don't think that will happen again, if I will be honest with you.
[258:56.89]Okay, so sort of put their hands on this thing.
[259:10.26]The skulls.
[259:13.32]Ooh, bugs.
[259:14.34]Bugs and geodes.
[259:15.12]This is like... My favorite room.
[259:22.93]Anything else I can interact with?
[259:24.37]The shoes, right?
[259:25.33]So, what did you do?
[259:27.75]You touched a beetle.
[259:30.58]Then you touched a... This head.
[259:33.78]And I think that's... And you also went over here and you touched...
[259:42.91]Uh, salamander, whatever that is.
[259:44.73]No matter what order.
[260:01.68]OK.
[260:01.82]Alright, what are the options?
[260:02.70]It's butterfly, head, beetle.
[260:06.78]Alligator.
[260:08.55]Beetle.
[260:09.89]Snake.
[260:10.93]Butterfly.
[260:12.17]Head.
[260:12.89]Beetle.
[260:14.25]Alright, there's two different beetles.
[260:19.93]You put your hands all over this thing.
[260:22.97]What kind of beetle is it?
[260:23.65]It's a beetle that's going like this.
[260:33.94]Okay.
[260:39.09]Does it matter the order?
[260:45.00]Probably.
[260:56.96]Would you eat any of the bugs?
[260:57.98]No, of course not.
[261:03.56]Well, I guess he was.
[261:05.03]Where do they start?
[261:07.79]started here you went beetle beetle skull beetle skull salamander okay there it is there you go okay good give me that butterfly
[261:45.85]I'm a case.
[262:38.32]This will knock out the parasite.
[262:41.10]But only for a time.
[262:46.03]You ready?
[262:46.43]To salute.
[262:55.54]It kind of looks like there's a grimace shape.
[262:57.80]Just remember, it's not a cure.
[263:00.54]We still need to find a way to get that thing out of you.
[263:10.94]It's coming.
[263:16.42]This guy again.
[263:17.38]I don't understand.
[263:26.29]It should be working by now.
[263:30.12]Take the ember and go.
[263:32.28]Once the parasite is sedated, you can give me back that damn stone.
[263:35.46]I can't leave you here.
[263:37.63]Not like this.
[263:38.39]Spare me.
[263:39.25]I'll be fine.
[263:40.83]You got another promise to keep.
[263:44.27]Alright.
[263:45.09]But you come find me as soon as you're done here.
[263:52.94]Okay, well.
[263:54.70]Round three?
[263:56.08]Do I have any ammo?
[263:57.82]Oh, no.
[263:58.46]We're just going.
[263:58.96]Okay.
[264:35.27]She's cured.
[264:39.29]Oh, I should have peed.
[265:22.85]I'm just rocking around.
[265:24.35]Okay.
[265:27.32]I'm going to pee.
[265:28.92]I'll be right back.
[265:35.50]Maybe this might be one more break after this.
[265:37.99]We'll see.
[265:38.23]I'm just going to go.
[265:39.01]Be right back.
[270:32.81]I have returned.
[270:36.37]He must be going through some shit in there.
[270:38.23]Yeah, I was going through some shit in the bathroom.
[270:56.90]OK, wait, where's my headphones?
[271:12.91]Why are you pouring tea in the toilet?
[271:14.91]That is a good question because I got a good answer for you.
[271:20.16]When I... I used to talk about tea all the time.
[271:23.92]I used to drink tea all the time.
[271:25.52]I still do sometimes.
[271:27.54]But that's like a 2017, 2016 lore.
[271:36.49]And also people used to say that they could hear me peeing into the toilet every time I went to the bathroom.
[271:43.29]So it's kind of a combination of a few things.
[271:44.79]Alright, let's get back to it.
[271:54.41]Are we ready?
[271:56.03]Chapter five.
[272:00.80]Yeah, loud pee.
[272:01.88]Yeah, that's what it was.
[272:06.60]OK.
[272:23.97]No stuff.
[272:33.75]Louise's footprints.
[272:36.81]Must have gone this way.
[272:38.71]His handprints.
[272:39.69]Alright, so I got it.
[272:40.24]So that's a what is it a moon?
[272:41.38]So here is a son.
[272:44.50]OK, moons are open.
[273:07.34]OK, moons are open.
[273:08.66]Let me check over here, wait.
[273:18.21]OK.
[273:26.62]Sun needs to be opened.
[273:42.98]Articles of pursuit.
[273:43.99]Okay.
[273:49.17]Continue with my current method to change nothing, but instead widen my search.
[273:53.33]My microphone needs to be closer.
[273:54.73]Okay.
[274:06.32]What color is each subject?
[274:07.38]We know green is always science, but what's red, blue, etc.? ?
[274:14.09]Hmm.
[274:16.70]To me, red is math.
[274:18.48]Right?
[274:18.80]Just like, oh, math.
[274:20.10]It's math.
[274:23.68]What about, like, social studies?
[274:26.22]Social studies is blue, I think.
[274:35.55]Math is blue?
[274:37.57]Hmm.
[274:38.35]Yeah, no, red is math.
[274:42.35]Science is green, yeah, for sure.
[274:55.12]Making sure I don't miss any... Alright, this is open now.
[274:57.94]Okay, so now I can open this and go down.
[275:03.96]English?
[275:06.68]You know, math might actually be yellow and English might be blue.
[275:17.02]That's tough.
[275:21.12]You're demented for that.
[275:23.05]It's tough though, because...
[275:27.60]I don't know, it's a good question.
[275:28.78]OK, so I need this to be a moon.
[275:33.40]It's not a moon.
[275:36.49]I can't go anywhere else.
[275:50.13]There you go.
[275:54.07]OK wait.
[275:58.30]There's nothing else I can do up here, right?
[276:01.12]Yeah, this is a this is a. This is a moon.
[276:11.37]Did I have it right the first time?
[276:14.73]Fight chat fight.
[276:20.49]Green might not always be science.
[276:22.43]Science might be blue because of, like, I don't know, water?
[276:27.72]Like, ooh, like marine life.
[276:30.90]Does that make sense?
[276:36.03]Yeah, but green could also be... No, yeah, you're right.
[276:40.03]Green is always science, no matter what.
[276:42.03]I think that's a given.
[276:43.61]Okay, hold on.
[276:44.13]I gotta play the video game.
[276:46.84]I just walked up and down the same set of stairs three times.
[276:55.22]OK, let's go down.
[276:56.80]OK.
[277:07.63]Can I shoot it up there?
[277:14.14]I can't, so this has to be a sun.
[277:31.53]So I have to jump across and just... Okay, so hold on.
[277:43.38]Can I... Go across?
[277:51.36]But that's not... Wait, hold on.
[277:53.00]I want to screw this up.
[277:55.34]Do I have it right right now?
[278:00.60]I think I do, because then I pull it one more time, and then down here I'll pull it, and it'll be back to normal, I think, right?
[278:07.64]You guys are still fighting about the subject.
[278:10.56]Okay.
[278:11.82]French is... What color is math?
[278:13.68]Red.
[278:13.86]A lot of people said red, yeah.
[278:19.62]Math is white.
[278:21.92]Blue is math because it's cold and logical.
[278:23.97]Green is science because plants and chlorophyll... Hold on, let me... I gotta read this.
[278:29.73]Oh, hold on.
[278:30.37]It got deleted.
[278:48.47]Yeah, green is always science.
[278:49.83]What about orange?
[278:59.37]What would be red besides math?
[279:00.65]I'm going to leave that open for now.
[279:13.19]Social studies is orange.
[279:15.55]Yeah, that does seem pretty... That seems pretty accurate.
[279:25.50]I'd kind of have to look at it.
[279:26.44]I would need to have the colors in the notebooks.
[279:42.95]Red is health.
[279:44.97]White could be health, too.
[279:47.14]So could red.
[279:50.22]Red could be health.
[279:51.56]Or blood.
[279:55.04]Green is health?
[280:00.07]Oh, I don't know.
[280:00.77]I think green is always science.
[280:04.55]What is this?
[280:10.67]I'll leave some signs to point you in the right direction.
[280:13.19]Okay.
[280:13.77]There's a treasure over here.
[280:24.94]Red is good for electives.
[280:32.07]Yeah.
[280:32.23]I'm thinking white would be...
[280:46.73]I think English is blue.
[280:49.15]English is blue.
[280:50.49]Health is white or red.
[280:53.19]Math is red or orange.
[281:03.62]Science is green.
[281:04.64]What about gym?
[281:10.13]Well, Jim, you don't like you don't like study in gym in a notebook.
[281:17.05]A nest Jim hope it's not a sign of things to come.
[281:20.43]No, not these fucking things, OK?
[281:35.25]Locked.
[281:35.59]I'll get it there.
[282:06.41]What about wizard class?
[282:24.12]What about purple?
[282:27.30]I feel like purple.
[282:29.64]It's too cool of a color to be a subject.
[282:33.30]Does that make any sense?
[282:35.78]It's too hip, I think, to be a subject.
[282:38.42]Math is purple?
[283:08.33]Purples for the dark arts.
[283:09.47]Shit, OK, hold on.
[283:14.01]What's on the other door?
[283:17.71]Splish splash.
[283:21.65]Yeah, we're doing this.
[283:23.88]Maybe not.
[283:26.52]I not go in there.
[283:38.87]He died very quickly.
[283:45.95]Purple is for purple alien.
[283:47.53]That's right.
[283:49.47]Did you catch sight of the giant shadow moving through the water?
[283:55.79]Looks like Gregorio's waterway has a lord raining over its murky channels.
[284:01.05]Find out what it is and catch it for me.
[284:03.67]Lord of the waterway.
[284:08.41]Okay.
[284:09.36]That sounds fun.
[284:11.20]In the water.
[284:18.49]That scared the shit out of me.
[284:20.23]Oh my God, why?
[284:21.71]I thought it was.
[284:29.49]I thought it grabbed me.
[284:30.35]I thought it was still alive and grab my leg or something.
[284:34.79]Dealt with a request.
[284:35.91]Oh, today's coming.
[284:41.82]The waterway.
[284:42.60]Cool.
[284:45.43]Okay, seven.
[284:49.83]Why is this small key two and this small key six?
[284:53.17]What's up with this scam here?
[284:56.03]That's kind of a scam.
[285:20.89]I think one of the cheap ones.
[285:24.83]Green herbs, red herbs.
[285:26.69]I mean, this thing's cool.
[285:33.98]What?
[285:35.28]You can't go wrong with that.
[285:37.82]Will that be all pleasant?
[285:39.34]Oh my God, this is a mess.
[285:45.55]Ooh, I got three blues.
[285:47.01]Let's go.
[285:55.68]Okay, I need, oh, two purples.
[285:58.57]Hey, two math glasses.
[286:14.28]And then I need blue, purple, and gray.

[288:46.50]This thing is unbeatable now.
[288:47.54]Okay.
[288:48.06]60,000.
[288:48.14]Should I just go for it?
[288:49.04]Do I need the ticket?
[288:49.78]I think I need the ticket.
[288:50.88]Oh.
[288:50.94]Oops.
[289:17.30]OK, I have.
[289:19.75]What are you?
[289:20.39]What is happening?
[289:24.21]What the hell are you doing?
[289:43.35]Stocking up while you come back any.
[289:51.34]Just make it all.
[289:52.10]Just make a ton of machine gun ammo.
[289:56.34]Okay, that's pretty good.
[289:57.84]What do I got now?
[290:05.67]Alright, don't eat the fish.

[290:09.85]Bunch of ammo.

[290:12.27]I've got something new for you, mate.
[290:17.39]Ruby's all rubbish.
[290:18.41]He makes no difference.
[290:20.67]I don't want to do that.
[290:21.85]Wait, is this an outfit?
[290:25.38]Charm.
[290:26.30]Oh, I thought that was an Ada outfit.
[290:28.68]I was like, oh, wait, this is a new outfit.
[290:32.15]Then we can talk.
[290:34.23]You don't need a ticket?
[290:36.83]Yeah, I don't want to be just completely broke, though.
[290:40.16]But, whatever.
[290:40.94]Let's do it.
[290:42.14]This thing is disgusting.
[290:44.16]I think that's all I want to do.
[290:45.48]Yes, it is.
[291:05.63]What's the ammo here?
[291:07.11]70 shots.
[291:08.76]Sweet.
[291:18.40]Read the charm description.
[291:23.89]Rip shields away from certain enemies using the grapple gun.
[291:26.33]That's great.
[291:27.61]Next time then.
[291:31.42]Okay, well, this is what I need.
[291:32.68]So I'm good.
[291:33.12]Alright.
[291:33.66]Now let's fight the giant monster in the water.
[291:37.48]Imagine it's just right here.
[291:39.43]Let's kill this thing.
[291:48.65]Can I get down there?
[291:52.93]No.
[291:54.96]Okay, let's go.
[291:59.47]So where is progress now?
[292:00.83]Down... You know what?
[292:02.55]I'm gonna open that.
[292:03.27]I have a key now.
[292:07.67]Pop it open.
[292:15.64]Every time it explodes, I think it grabs me.
[292:46.31]He died in the water, shit.
[293:11.01]What chair does he have?
[293:13.44]Probably some CEO chair like Herman Miller or something.
[293:19.69]This is a breastfeeding chair.
[293:33.93]This is a nursing chair.
[293:36.87]And I wish I'm not making that up.
[293:41.16]This is a nursing chair.
[293:48.89]But it was perfect.
[293:50.41]And I had to have it.
[293:51.91]It was fucking perfect.
[294:05.32]It's just like, this thing is great.
[294:06.88]It works well.
[294:08.88]It can be a regular chair.
[294:10.04]It's just a chair.
[294:10.68]Who cares?
[294:20.85]Congrats That should take care of the water.
[294:32.76]Oh wait I can fight the thing
[294:54.03]I want to fight the thing.
[294:56.19]Got some new wares, stranger.

[295:09.28]A deal well struck.
[295:12.08]You already had this.
[295:13.01]You had this before.

[295:23.68]oh oh chat what is chat taking it too far it's chat taking it too far settle down it's a chair it's it's it's a funny little thing but relax don't have to take it too far
[295:49.33]We can all agree it's a slightly humorous thing.
[295:53.15]Don't be weird about it.
[295:55.05]Or you're gonna get fucking zapped.
[296:01.41]Okay.
[296:09.44]Oh my god.
[296:10.20]Is that him?
[296:15.82]Is this the big guy?
[297:15.61]Where's the big guy?
[297:17.21]Wait.
[297:21.59]Where's this diamond?
[297:22.56]I don't see it.
[297:29.20]That's gross.
[297:30.14]Don't make me regret saying that.
[297:32.32]It's funny, but come on guys, relax.
[297:36.83]Don't make it weird.
[297:45.81]Don't make it weird.
[298:07.45]What made you choose this chair over the others?
[298:10.69]Ah, OK, here's the next part of this, which is why it's funny.
[298:15.84]It's one of the only chairs at Target.
[298:24.67]There are two chairs at Target.
[298:27.47]This is one of them.
[298:31.07]There may be one to three chairs in your Target.
[298:36.00]It's the Target chair.
[298:49.22]I love target, yeah.
[298:51.46]It's also temporary.
[298:53.88]So I think I said at the beginning of the stream that that the big one right there.
[298:58.39]Yep.
[299:00.43]I'm getting a different chair to be here.
[299:05.49]This is very temporary.
[299:08.05]I'm just going to use it as a regular chair after the other chair is just not here.
[299:12.51]It will be soon.
[299:20.08]How long had it been living down here?
[299:26.38]Are you going to betray this recliner?
[299:29.61]It's actually, believe it or not, this is actually pretty comfortable.
[299:32.71]I like it.
[299:33.41]It's just like, doesn't it just rock?
[299:42.10]I want to turn that in.
[300:03.11]What should I get now?
[300:07.03]I think I just saved my money.
[300:32.20]Is the charm worth it?
[300:35.84]Actually, yeah, it definitely is.
[300:41.87]Yeah, it's only five.
[300:52.74]Hard to find a nice desk chair these days, and those gaming chairs are actually the most uncomfortable.
[300:56.76]This nursing, whatever, like baby chair, whatever this actually is, it's just a great chair.
[301:03.87]You can use it for whatever you want, like me.
[301:09.01]It actually is crazy.
[301:10.27]Let's get real for a second.
[301:13.51]finding furniture that I just when you just want like a small thing to sit in just like a little thing it's kind of hard to find something like this this kind of stuff doesn't really exist it's either like a giant huge thing or it's part of a big couch or it's a curved up here it's made out of materially it's just uncomfortable and it's somebody just said it's really expensive so I I this is exactly what I wanted it for
[301:46.67]Everything is huge now, yeah.
[301:49.93]And now, is it like the best chair in the world?
[301:51.90]No, I mean, it was... I want to say this was... I mean, it wasn't cheap, cheap, cheap.
[301:58.34]I mean, it was still... It was like, I think, a couple hundred bucks?
[302:00.42]A hundred-something bucks, I think?
[302:03.38]But you get a chair that's like a nice chair like this, you might have to spend $500 to $1,000.
[302:07.02]Which is... I just... I got one coming that's going to be a little bit better, but...
[302:20.05]Yeah, some of these chairs are like over five plus 100,000, 100, 100, not 100,000, 5,000 to like, I've seen chairs that are 5,000.
[302:36.91]You know, those big, they almost look like, okay, you know, the chairs look like cigars.
[302:40.45]They look like gigantic cigars.
[302:41.94]It's like the only way I can describe it.
[302:46.04]The cigar chair.
[302:49.03]It's like this high off the ground and this wide.
[302:52.33]And it looks like a cigar.
[302:55.49]Those things are more than $1,000 to $2,000 at least.
[302:59.47]Yeah, the Mr. Green's chair.
[303:00.45]Exactly.
[303:07.36]Okay.
[303:11.70]I think I don't need to... Is there any more?
[303:13.70]There's an upgrade.
[303:17.10]I'll do it later.
[303:23.42]I guess I can pull shields away now.
[303:31.27]But yeah, I want to say... I'll be in this chair for the next few streams maybe.
[303:39.83]The next two or three streams.
[303:42.07]But there is another one that I want.
[303:43.79]That I want to get.
[303:44.39]That's a little more elaborate.
[303:46.27]That will help with my legs.
[303:49.09]But this is going to just kind of sit in the corner over here and just be a chair.
[303:54.48]So this whole setup is temporary.
[303:56.46]You'll see some changes in the next few weeks.
[303:59.28]I'm excited for it.
[304:09.83]Ooh.
[304:15.23]Auto can sleep in it.
[304:16.21]Yeah, this would be like a nice little auto chair probably.
[304:18.53]Although it'd be hard for him to get up on top of it.
[304:21.45]It'd be hard for him to get in and lie down on it.
[304:27.67]I'd have to pick him up and he might be able to sit with me in the other one.
[304:32.02]That'd be kind of cool.
[304:44.38]Is he doing alright?
[304:45.06]Yeah, he's doing great.
[304:47.70]He's doing wonderful.
[304:52.12]Oh, you bet.
[304:52.50]You better believe they'll be.
[304:53.80]I'll be hanging out here with him sitting either right on my lap or right.
[304:56.32]Because the other chair I'm getting is a lot bigger.
[304:57.96]They'd be right in the face.
[305:01.10]It's not quite a cigar chair.
[305:04.82]But it's a little bit wider than this one.
[305:12.69]OK, well, I got the treasure I wanted.
[305:26.27]Where is it?
[305:26.69]Oh, it's hanging.
[305:27.86]Alrighty.
[305:33.96]We need to go down there.
[305:39.84]Wait, I could climb up.
[305:41.24]Yeah, wait a minute.
[305:51.05]Is it worth getting down?
[305:51.91]Is that open?
[305:56.21]I need a red robe.
[305:59.20]I actually thought about streaming with a robe on.
[306:00.76]That'd be fun.
[306:02.58]Shit, I can't open this.
[306:05.04]Okay, I gotta lock in here.
[306:08.26]How did I even get back up here?
[306:09.22]I was just kind of talking.
[306:16.82]There we go.
[306:17.10]Alright, I want to... Go this way, yeah.
[306:27.29]You look like Hugh Hefner.
[306:36.30]And then this way.
[306:53.15]Please do one grapple melee.
[306:54.69]Yeah, I don't know.
[306:56.49]If it's just melee from a distance, it doesn't seem to be working unless it's a different button combination that I'm not doing.
[307:00.65]Okay.
[307:15.20]Where are you?
[307:15.60]You're gonna make me eat my egg or my fish or whatever it is.
[307:31.39]You need to be far away and then hit it.
[307:36.85]I'll try it again, but... I feel like I've been too far away almost.
[307:42.93]Thanks for the directions, Louise.
[307:53.22]Can I sneak in here?
[307:53.80]Nope.
[308:01.49]Remember, guys, if there's not a button on the screen, he can't see it and he won't know.
[308:05.69]Well, that's not true because even if there is a button on the screen that says rotate with Q and E, I apparently won't see that either.
[308:11.47]So I'm kind of just lost regardless.
[308:16.87]So... I don't know if I can be helped.
[308:21.50]Oh...
[308:33.04]I'm so concerned about that person.
[308:37.89]Holy shit, that was cool.
[308:41.21]That dude over there.
[308:44.35]That wasn't far away.
[308:48.99]This person over here is... How are they still... I'm confused.
[308:53.68]Why are they not breaking out?
[309:16.62]Oh!
[309:25.89]Thank God.
[309:34.92]Nice.
[309:39.08]He took like two.
[309:39.84]Yeah, why did he die so quickly?
[309:46.25]He died incredibly fast.
[309:50.69]Was it the flashbang?
[309:51.61]Give me the item.
[310:07.46]The gun is just so upgraded.
[310:09.42]Oh, then I'm... Start using it more often.
[310:38.26]Did I get everything?
[310:41.70]Maybe.
[310:46.70]Make some more ammo.
[310:47.44]I think I can do it, yeah.
[310:53.78]He just melted when I shot him with this like two times.
[310:56.41]That was awesome.
[310:59.03]Thing is filthy.
[311:12.00]Use the charm for extra SMG ammo.
[311:17.61]I think I have it on.
[311:19.93]Isn't it on?
[311:27.79]I think that's it right there.
[311:42.55]cool chair it is a cool chair it doesn't matter where it's from it's a cool chair welcome I've got something new for you 35 000 alright what do I want to do here I want that so I'm gonna sell oh well there you go a deal well struck all yours stranger melee crit that sounds good now
[312:14.01]What if it is from Target?
[312:15.03]Yeah, it doesn't matter.
[312:17.23]Chair is a chair.
[312:17.93]And if it's a decent chair, it's a decent chair.
[312:23.55]Honestly, even when the new chair, when I get the new one, who knows?
[312:29.32]I might sit in the new one and go, put me back in the other one.
[312:35.06]What if it's not the same?
[312:35.98]What if I really just like this one?
[312:41.91]Here's the... Let me compulsively save it again.
[312:49.22]Current one looks comfy.
[312:50.04]It is.
[312:52.12]It just does exactly what I want it to do.
[312:56.74]Be a chair that can swivel.
[312:58.60]It can rock.
[313:00.52]It's fairly comfortable.
[313:02.28]Okay, I will say this material is a little grainy.
[313:07.07]It's a little rough.
[313:09.15]But...
[313:10.84]It's not bad.
[313:12.08]It's fine.
[313:12.46]It's comfortable.
[313:26.07]No footrest.
[313:26.85]No.
[313:28.21]Just a chair.
[313:34.11]What is a man without his baby chair?
[313:39.17]True.
[313:41.98]That's it.
[313:42.72]Come on now.
[313:48.68]This spot will do.
[313:50.52]It's a real man-sized chair.
[313:58.55]Alright, let's kill this guy once and for all.
[314:12.55]Definitely got him.
[314:18.44]What?
[314:21.52]The thing crashed from the ceiling and landed right on his head.
[314:23.66]It didn't kill him?
[314:25.00]That would have killed any man or living being or thing.
[314:28.87]Oh, God.
[314:31.73]Can't stand the clingy type.
[314:34.29]Time to end this for good.
[314:51.34]Uh-oh.
[314:53.64]Let go, let go, let go.
[315:04.29]Oh.
[315:10.41]Not yet.
[315:13.71]Okay, now I take it.
[315:45.71]This gun is so unbelievable.
[315:48.60]I could make the difficulty harder if I wanted to.
[315:52.12]Holy shit, this thing is maxed out.
[315:54.04]Nevermind.
[316:24.84]Well, I'm still going to use it.
[316:26.04]Give me all the stuff first before I lose access to all of it.
[316:30.61]Hey, you gotta shoot it in the orange goo.
[316:52.10]Ouch.
[317:07.71]Alright, I think I got all the stuff.
[317:16.92]Oh, okay, this should be it.
[317:50.11]Almost out of bullets.
[318:03.26]One more time, maybe.
[318:06.27]Yeah, that's it.
[318:23.05]I thought I got a cure does not work currently.
[318:42.78]Now to find Louise.
[318:55.36]Don't tell me I'm not good at a game when I did look what I just did.
[319:01.16]That's like.
[319:03.16]123 like holy shit dude.
[319:09.24]Yeah, I mean I'm seeing like a lot of people saying like holy shit.
[319:12.36]I actually had it wrong.
[319:13.50]He's like really fucking good.
[319:16.33]I sometimes I like to prove people wrong.
[319:27.75]A bad guy.
[319:29.05]Krauser just stole the Amber.
[319:33.43]Leon's fighting him now.
[319:35.95]I'm on my way.
[319:39.03]I'm sorry.
[319:41.79]I'm not going to make it.
[319:43.19]I'll send you my files.
[319:45.27]They should help.
[319:47.34]I like this area.
[319:48.60]The Amber, Louise.
[319:49.82]Where is it?
[319:50.38]These weird mushrooms.
[319:51.50]Thank you for the chance to do good again.
[319:55.84]What are you saying?
[320:14.85]Ada does not give a. Ada does not give a heck.
[320:23.46]Yeah, I know.
[320:27.10]Part of her character.
[320:43.88]Close one.
[320:44.56]Yeah.
[320:47.61]Thanks for that.
[320:48.27]You guys keeping me honest, right?
[320:49.59]I don't want to say.
[320:51.09]Right.
[320:55.72]I don't want to say that.
[320:56.54]Louise, the goodbye is going to have to wait.
[321:23.63]Yeah.
[321:24.99]No, I'm just... I didn't say anything.
[321:26.75]Mom, are you reading chat?
[321:27.85]Yeah, they just... They said it was a joke.
[321:43.62]Wait, if my mom was watching, wouldn't she see the face there?
[321:54.38]I guess I should be thankful.
[321:57.48]She could see the facecam.
[321:59.80]Sorry, Ma.
[322:11.04]Okay.
[322:18.35]Uh, one or, what, two chapters left?
[322:20.75]Okay, the last chapter's probably a runaway from the big scary monster.
[322:26.92]So, there's probably one real chapter remaining.
[322:31.36]But, it's all good.
[322:32.76]I'm ready to go.
[322:33.82]Let's do it.
[322:47.01]That was really lazy.
[322:47.91]I just needed to walk two more steps.
[322:51.05]How do you get over there so fast?
[323:11.53]A clean strike.
[323:19.47]That was okay.
[323:27.36]Stormtrooper aim.
[323:28.84]I got it in two hits.
[323:42.89]Alright, wait a minute.
[323:55.31]Trying to do the grapple hook thing.
[323:59.47]End up running at them and.
[324:05.46]Not far enough, really.
[324:07.38]How do you?
[324:08.96]Stagger from that far away.
[324:10.08]OK, we have to get down there fast.
[324:22.75]Can I grapple hook down there?
[324:28.93]I'm just gonna wait for them to get up here.
[324:30.97]Kill them, then go.
[324:55.19]Grapple gun melee attack type.
[324:59.93]Why is it showing me a controller?
[325:01.11]It's F. But isn't F already bound to... Because I changed the controls to have...
[325:29.22]Okay, so here's what's happening.
[325:30.74]So I've rebound my melee to thumb button.
[325:34.58]I thought it was telling me just to hit the melee button, not F. Like, oh, hey, hit F, but also hit thumb button because that's what you have it bound to.
[325:43.44]Because see, sometimes it like changes.
[325:46.91]Yeah, okay, well, it's... I thought they were the same button.
[325:56.51]Okay, let's go.
[326:04.25]No, turn it again.
[326:05.13]I collected the money.
[326:12.41]Yeah, for some reason I thought it was just melee from far away.
[326:16.09]And even though I did see F, F to me was the same binding of the same key, which is thumb button.
[326:27.23]That's on me.
[326:29.58]I don't even need it.
[326:34.03]What do I do with my money now?
[326:36.17]I think I'm just going to buy gunpowder.
[326:38.21]Because, come on.
[327:04.50]I'll buy gunpowder.
[327:05.06]Do that too.
[327:06.20]Uh, attack speed by one and a half times for the knife.
[327:29.99]A well tuned weapon can make up for a lack of skill, friend.
[327:37.23]Dazzled, I like durability more.
[327:40.00]Our craftsmanship demands no less.
[327:45.32]Rubies or rubbish, it makes no difference.
[327:48.01]The price is going to be regenerators, so I'm going to keep the scope.
[328:00.62]There's some things money can't.
[328:03.51]An interesting choice.
[328:05.63]I'll keep a lookout.
[328:07.91]As well, right?
[328:14.77]For items, then.
[328:16.13]Welcome, stranger.
[328:17.43]Where would it be?
[328:19.18]What can I do you for?
[328:21.18]A deal well struck.
[328:28.34]There you are.
[328:29.08]Okay, full durability on the knife.
[328:32.88]Pick up your charm.
[328:34.34]Didn't I?
[328:35.78]I think I had that right.
[328:37.60]It's already on.
[328:38.72]Hmm.
[328:38.98]It's not on there?
[328:40.02]Isn't that it right there?
[329:02.98]Where's that screen to equip stuff?
[329:09.41]Like, how do I get to that menu screen?
[329:11.07]Oh, it's typewriter.
[329:19.50]Beat three Novus Stardores.
[329:23.66]Giant insects.
[329:26.31]I'll try.
[329:35.19]Yeah, that's on.
[329:47.75]Nova Star Doors.
[329:53.43]It was a really bad try, I'll say.
[329:59.37]Okay, this way and then treasure and then down that way.
[330:21.70]Don't be spotted.
[330:22.41]I upgraded the knife, might as well use it.
[330:55.19]Saved ammo.
[330:55.75]Alright, let's try it.
[331:02.80]How do I do it?
[331:06.30]Got it.
[331:15.89]Treasure is straight through here.
[331:36.51]Backflip.
[331:38.27]Frontflip.
[331:42.62]Cool flip.
[331:56.64]We suck.
[332:02.30]Oh shit.
[332:09.98]I ain't dealing with that.
[332:19.75]Treasure up there.
[332:21.01]Gonna play Starfield.
[332:26.20]Um, I couldn't really get into it.
[332:38.99]I was never a big Bethesda game player or just didn't really get into it.
[332:44.14]Alright, we're down and then OK, let's do this first.
[333:00.20]Although, to be fair though, I never really loved games where there's just a lot of dialog options.
[333:11.19]And dialog options that really just, it's, hey, here's like four things.
[333:15.89]You can just talk to this person.
[333:17.07]I never was a big fan of it.
[333:20.96]It always kind of just leads to the same thing.
[333:27.01]Now, Baldur's Gate has dialog options, but I feel like I'm invested in my character a little more somehow.
[333:32.94]I feel like it actually means things, and somebody just said sorcery too, but a lot of stuff you do in sorcery has immediate consequences.
[333:40.00]I feel like a lot of times in the games where you pick a lot of dialog options, it's just like, hey, you can kind of talk to this person however you want.
[333:48.24]It doesn't really necessarily matter too much, but you can just have a conversation the way that you would want to.
[333:54.76]Like, that's cool, but never really did it for me.
[334:05.96]Except one randomly will insult them.
[334:08.43]Yeah.
[334:08.59]Alright.
[334:11.29]I am going to get crushed by one of these if I'm not careful.
[334:17.27]I didn't get the treasure.
[334:18.13]Did I miss my opportunity to get it?
[334:32.58]Oh, there it is.
[334:36.88]Dialog actually matters in Baldur's Gate 3.
[334:39.28]Oh yeah, it really does.
[334:48.83]Baldur's Gate, the consequences are like sorcery.
[334:55.19]And obviously my attention span is pretty low already.
[334:58.85]So if there's not immediate stakes on something, I kind of lose interest.
[335:06.17]Which is like, hey, talk to this person.
[335:07.35]You need to go figure this out.
[335:08.53]It's like, OK, cool.
[335:09.33]And it's like, oh, by the way, you're going to.
[335:13.42]You can sit here for a while and just talk.
[335:15.04]It doesn't really mean anything, but you can do it.
[335:17.84]I always just skip it completely.
[335:29.91]You piece of shit.
[335:50.23]Where is it?
[335:51.49]Oh, it's right there.
[336:09.87]I thought I was not even close, guys.
[336:12.13]I thought I was in a perfect safe zone.
[336:16.31]Holy shit.
[336:20.17]I may have dumped my pants a little.
[336:21.64]I think I may have dumped the chair.
[336:26.06]OK, what the hell?
[336:27.58]Now I gotta go all the way around.
[336:29.74]He's having another brownout.
[336:42.14]Not just don't don't use any of these for thumbnails.
[336:44.54]I know you want to.
[336:46.07]Don't use something else.
[336:47.69]Use me going like this.
[337:03.05]Okay, try it again.
[337:18.46]Yeah, it sucks.
[337:19.06]It's a long run, isn't it?
[337:20.38]Yeah, I can hear you're out of breath.
[337:24.22]Don't have the strength to attack, do you?
[337:25.62]I was going to give you a minute.
[337:44.50]Okay.
[337:46.42]Now go back the way we came.
[337:48.78]I can actually go up here, can't I?
[338:15.85]Let's not make the same mistake twice.
[338:17.28]I made the same mistake twice.
[338:20.58]Those of you keeping score at home.
[338:23.02]On your scoreboard.
[338:23.80]We're good.
[338:50.70]Who shot that?
[338:51.22]Do it!
[339:05.96]And you missed completely, and now you got your leg hit.
[339:27.42]I got a lot of herbs.
[339:42.02]I don't actually stop using my my rifle because of the generators.
[339:51.17]How do I pull it off?
[339:54.43]Look like I had there we go.
[340:07.17]What do you do Stevie?
[340:08.81]What do you do Stevie?
[340:11.21]What do you do Stevie?
[340:13.31]What do you do Stevie?
[340:28.84]You're alive.
[340:30.40]I thought you were dead.
[340:40.78]Okay.
[340:42.52]Now what?
[340:44.88]Into the ancient Chantry.
[340:56.73]I hear Laurel, to be honest.
[341:10.31]Do not shoot that.
[341:42.75]Grappled melee doesn't make any sense.
[341:43.87]Why wouldn't they just come towards the player?
[341:45.27]Kind of like a scorpion?
[341:47.13]Yeah.
[341:48.49]Well, I think, yeah.
[341:50.53]Unless they weigh a thousand pounds.
[341:55.61]It's just so unrealistic.
[342:22.36]OK, I'm surprised we're still in Chapter 5.
[342:24.38]I figured we would get out of it by now.
[342:28.42]This fucking outfit.
[342:29.54]Somebody told Leon that that hat gives him like plus 20% speed and they were just lying to him.
[342:54.31]That's the only reason why he's got it on.
[343:10.38]Mr. Kennedy, why do you have that stupid hat on?
[343:14.54]I don't think it's stupid, but it's stupid for the occasion.
[343:19.84]You're an idiot.
[343:20.30]It gives me plus 5% damage.
[343:22.57]Don't ever do that voice again.
[343:51.32]Sorry.
[344:31.79]Oh, okay.
[344:32.95]There's a show that is a SCORN-like.
[344:35.71]Have you guys ever seen Ballmasters?
[344:39.03]Adult Swim?
[344:41.66]They do the SCORN.
[344:44.38]Randomly throughout that show, you just hear, Ballmasters.
[344:52.56]They'll be in the middle of a game, and it's like, oh, a big play happens.
[344:55.03]Ballmasters.
[344:55.49]Ballmasters.
[344:57.24]They do SCORN.
[344:58.74]I was like, holy shit, that's awesome.
[345:02.70]It's actually a SCORN leg.
[345:08.07]I've been waiting for somebody to do that for years, and I guess somebody did it.
[345:12.43]That's a crazy show, by the way.
[345:18.38]That show is very alive.
[345:19.52]There's a lot happening in that show.
[345:37.21]You didn't even play SCORN.
[345:39.71]You smoking crack?
[345:46.92]Stop it.
[346:11.53]This is a great setup.
[346:12.43]Is that a motorcycle?
[346:19.16]It's a boat, dude.
[346:20.42]I need to eat a fucking jar of peanut butter after this.
[346:23.86]I thought he took off on a motorcycle.
[346:29.12]God.
[346:29.58]I just hear like, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom, vroom.
[346:35.04]Like, oh, dude, cool.
[346:36.12]I want to see what, like, fucking sick variety he's got.
[346:47.34]Looking for something.
[346:54.67]Chapter complete.
[346:59.43]Why peanut butter is got protein and good fats and all that stuff, dude.
[347:20.61]Peanut butter or hummus, eat them both.
[347:23.45]Not at the same time, but.
[347:32.16]The hat flies off and he's just like, oh shit, you look like you've got something to say.
[347:36.82]I have something to ask you.
[347:41.11]But I don't think I'll get a straight answer.
[347:45.34]Fucking stinks in that hat.
[347:47.76]Just telling you.
[347:48.74]Raccoon City.
[347:50.24]He's been wearing it for like six days.
[347:52.36]The world changed.
[347:55.96]You try to save one person, a hundred others die.
[347:57.99]I guess I changed too.
[348:03.95]You.
[348:05.61]Leon S. Kennedy.
[348:08.45]You haven't changed.
[348:11.35]You just think you have.
[348:20.24]So here's my question.
[348:24.02]Have you changed, Ada?
[348:27.38]Or are you just trying to use me again?
[348:31.20]What do you think?
[348:34.84]We're here.
[348:40.19]Don't think too hard, handsome.
[348:43.09]See you later.
[348:50.70]Story of my life.
[348:52.22]Alright, see you later Leon.
[348:55.02]Look at the improv show you're about to go acting.
[349:12.08]Good one.
[349:12.52]Yes.
[349:13.32]Yes.
[349:13.68]That was a good one.
[349:14.56]I think it was too.
[349:15.22]That one stinks.
[349:33.17]Not yet.
[349:33.81]What's your opinion?
[349:36.53]I don't even have this rifle.
[349:39.18]Whose blood are you here for this time?
[349:41.89]Mine are saddlers.
[349:44.29]That all depends on you.
[349:45.89]That's a sick weapon too.
[349:46.91]I don't even have it.
[349:47.45]Change of plans.
[349:52.16]Of course.
[349:53.82]I wish I could put them all in that fucking hat.
[349:55.84]Think that gun's gonna be enough?
[350:00.04]Interesting.
[350:05.34]Okay.
[350:06.76]I'll do it.
[350:08.66]But, cost you extra.
[350:11.98]Wise decision.
[350:12.72]I'll send you the new coordinates.
[350:16.61]And remember, I do not like... Waiting, I know.
[350:19.43]It's gonna say dialog options.
[350:26.01]So just get right to the point, goddammit.
[350:50.00]Head for the comms facility.
[350:51.16]Okay.
[351:10.30]So this is the island, right?
[351:11.96]Yeah.
[351:13.26]OK, treasures.
[351:14.76]Nice.
[351:43.61]Do I have to fight?
[351:46.86]Leon fights him, right?
[351:50.16]Crystal ore.
[352:13.75]Stab him!
[352:14.09]Stab him!
[352:14.47]Stab him!
[352:14.83]Stab him!
[352:15.19]Why are you reloading the gun?
[352:22.89]Too close!
[352:27.00]We're good.
[352:43.48]You gonna S plus all characters on perks?
[352:46.82]Uh, no, I did S plus on a few places with a few people.
[352:51.10]I wouldn't do that tonight though.
[352:55.24]I'm going to get to the end of the game and probably call it.
[352:56.78]And then I think Monday is the next time I'm going to be streaming.
[353:02.41]Monday I might be in a new setup.
[353:06.39]Well, an upgraded version of the one you see right now.
[353:09.97]I want to play Party Animals again.
[353:11.11]I think Ster wants to play it too.
[353:14.34]I also asked Vinny if he wanted to play as well, so we'll probably get a crew together.
[353:18.48]Play a little bit of Party Animals have fun.
[353:44.32]Okay.
[353:49.10]Did I get everything from this room?
[353:51.26]No.
[353:52.00]There is a treasure hanging right here.
[354:06.92]Oh, I missed the ammo.
[354:08.34]Whatever.
[354:11.38]Should be just up ahead.
[354:13.50]But getting through won't be easy.
[354:17.43]Ada and Wesker were added to Mercs.
[354:21.33]Wesker was fun.
[354:21.95]Wesker was a magnum, right?
[354:26.68]I've got some new items in stock.
[354:29.82]Come take a look.
[354:30.96]Welcome.
[354:32.10]Came into some other bits in Bob's too, mate.
[354:38.10]Running speed.
[354:39.53]That's kind of cold.
[354:42.15]Alright, do I... I think I want flash grenades.
[354:45.15]Flash grenades are the best.
[354:46.51]From what I remember.
[354:50.95]Especially in the end.
[354:54.21]Oh, what should I do?
[354:54.81]I don't know.
[355:04.43]Almost.
[355:07.56]Or do I just upgrade the hell out of the knife?
[355:13.78]Why not?
[355:14.46]40,000 for one and a half times attack speed.
[355:18.19]I've never done that before, so maybe I could try it.
[355:38.35]I'm going to hold on to everything else.
[355:39.39]40,000.
[355:39.41]It's okay for now.
[356:06.93]Red Rifle is probably the best.
[356:12.43]At this point, yeah.
[356:13.27]I mean, there's a whole... I got one more chapter after this, so... We'll see.
[356:28.88]I want some max health.
[356:29.54]If I could sell those... I'm not going to use them.
[356:39.50]These are so expensive.
[356:43.49]And maybe I will just buy the rocket launcher.
[356:49.01]Have like a super explosive thing at the end.
[356:51.15]Alright, handgun ammo is starting to get a little low.
[357:09.49]You're going to regret that bolt action with the regenerators.
[357:15.79]That's why I'm holding on to the rifle.
[357:17.41]Because, oh my goodness.
[357:19.33]I can bebop.
[357:24.65]No, rock steady.
[357:25.37]I forget which one.
[357:29.05]It hit me right in the forehead.
[357:50.99]Kill him, please.
[357:54.62]Another one?
[358:01.54]Where is he?
[358:03.58]Oh, he's right behind me.
[358:13.28]He's not.
[358:15.60]Oh my god!
[358:19.84]Oh, that was all explosive bolts.
[358:26.70]He just unloaded an entire magazine of rusty bolts.
[358:37.49]Somebody said I looked rusty.
[358:39.81]So I said rusty bolts while I was saying explosive bolts.
[358:47.02]I saved it, right?
[358:54.41]Did I save it right before that?
[358:57.16]Did I screw that up?
[358:58.18]No, we're good.
[358:58.72]OK, well that was kind of crazy.
[359:02.57]Try it again.
[359:36.82]I think it's so good.
[359:37.56]Alright, I gotta go this way now.
[359:40.70]Alright, I'm gonna blow you up when you land.
[359:42.40]Alright, where is he?
[359:54.99]Oh shit.
[360:11.11]Okay, you're dead.
[360:16.19]Collect everything.
[360:16.97]Okay, there's a bunch of money over there.
[360:35.71]He's actually playing.
[360:36.46]I thought he just talks.
[360:39.32]Well, we know what happens when I just talk.
[360:42.78]I, uh... I don't know that... I don't know Q and E rotate a puzzle.
[360:49.84]And I turn my head upside down to see the thing right side up.
[360:57.77]Oh, look at how... look at how pretty this is.
[360:59.33]This is like a... it's like Christmas.
[361:02.89]Somebody did all this.
[361:04.85]Look at that.
[361:05.39]Is it for me?
[361:11.18]All the decorations.
[361:13.58]That's so cute.
[361:14.50]Thanks for me.
[361:16.50]Wait, pressure.
[361:31.94]I should start using the knife more often.
[361:48.10]I think that's it.
[361:49.96]And yes, Claire.
[361:53.54]I'm sorry I'm late.
[362:01.33]I brought the medicine just in time.
[362:03.35]Can you stand?
[362:03.87]Where's Louise?
[362:09.05]He was worried about you.
[362:11.39]Until the end.
[362:16.94]Wait, why doesn't Ashley have different clothes on?
[362:21.08]If he's dressed like such an idiot.
[362:25.93]Wouldn't I have had her dressed in some outfit too?
[362:31.63]I think she had sunglasses on.
[362:34.08]Ada, come in.
[362:35.24]There's a lab where we can remove the parasites.
[362:38.04]Had a crazy hunch that you'd know where it is.
[362:41.38]Their most important facilities are housed in their sanctuary at the top of the mountain.
[362:45.78]Here comes the regenerators.
[362:46.74]Needed the encyclopedia.
[362:49.18]Worst thing ever.
[362:50.26]Happy to help.
[362:51.68]Now you owe me.
[363:02.75]Don't die on me now.
[363:05.25]OK.
[363:07.33]I need to make sure I use that very well so.
[363:12.16]Going to the left.
[363:17.04]No we're not.
[363:17.98]Oh hello.
[363:18.46]Sell two ornate beetles.
[363:38.39]There's one hidden in dissection in facility one and somebody stole the other.
[363:51.33]Just realize how much shit he has in his pockets.
[364:07.86]Alright, how much is the rocket launcher?
[364:09.02]80?
[364:09.10]I'm gonna hold.
[364:11.70]Hold my money.
[364:12.38]I'm doing that for the regenerators only.
[364:19.11]Okay.
[364:28.04]What has he got in his pocketses?
[364:34.82]Tons of stuff.
[364:39.06]I need to open this to get to the comms facility.
[364:42.00]It needs some power though.
[364:44.08]What?
[364:45.20]Does it work?
[364:48.07]I'm available.
[364:51.43]Alright, regenerators, I'm ready.
[365:09.40]I don't... have an automatic door.
[365:34.63]Yeah, the parasites, watch out.
[365:36.81]They regenerate indefinitely.
[365:39.24]But it's okay.
[365:50.23]I'm hiding.
[366:00.03]Holy shit.
[366:26.02]Oh a beetle.
[366:30.75]I'm not messing around.
[366:37.01]Pressure in here or is it?
[366:42.93]Above.
[366:58.24]Hmm, well, never mind.
[367:09.24]OK, I. Am ready.
[367:23.81]Wait.
[367:38.99]Whoa, whoa, whoa, they run, they run, they run.
[367:42.81]It's running at me.
[368:00.88]The book was way better.
[368:20.35]Is that back?
[368:21.93]It is.
[368:22.19]You should play Venga bus, but really faded.
[368:30.22]Like she's hearing Leon listen to it in the other room.
[368:36.33]I feel like that's the thing for post.
[368:39.13]That's funny, though.
[368:40.47]I'm going to give you a +2 for that one.
[368:51.80]Alright, fine.
[368:52.60]That's fine.
[368:54.48]I'm doing it.
[369:13.20]Vengaboys.
[369:47.08]You guys hear something?
[369:54.54]Ow!
[369:55.08]Something coming from the wall, it sounds like.
[370:04.55]That's coming from below my feet.
[370:17.42]This just sounds like it's coming out of her AirPods.
[371:18.73]I just wanna do this for a second.
[371:23.79]Like, dude, he's fucking somebody.
[371:25.16]He's sleeping.
[371:25.74]Somebody wake him up.
[371:36.63]Like, oh man, I've been playing Resident Evil all fucking day.
[371:39.03]I'm tired, man.
[371:39.87]But I got a playlist going.
[372:15.14]I'm sorry, I just wanted to make sure that you had to deal with the muted audio in the VOD as well.
[372:19.64]Okay, where are we going?
[372:57.59]No, I gotta go into the freezer.
[373:26.62]There is.
[373:28.12]What the fuck?
[373:31.01]Oh, goodness.
[373:58.85]Want that beetle?
[374:34.04]Jeez.
[374:34.32]Okay.
[374:41.74]I want that other beetle.
[375:21.54]Blood.
[375:22.04]What the hell is this thing?
[375:33.63]Oh, there it is.
[375:34.13]Okay, I got both beetles.
[375:38.89]Very cool.
[375:40.35]Now I got to get back down here.
[376:22.50]Science, math, English, reading arithmetic.
[376:39.71]He's in here somewhere.
[376:43.83]Don't know where though.
[376:49.41]Rotisserie chickens.
[376:56.00]Why is there a rotisserie chicken down here in the... Wait, okay.
[377:00.80]This is like the kitchen, I guess.
[377:02.61]Wait, what?
[377:33.37]Holy shit.
[377:41.77]Damn it.
[378:03.54]It just sounds like when Otto is sleeping.
[378:16.59]I hit him.
[378:21.05]I didn't hit him in one parasite.
[378:30.97]What the fuck are you talking about?
[378:39.16]What the hell?
[378:51.39]Why can I not hit this one?
[379:02.46]This one's been so finicky.
[379:05.60]Come on, dude.
[379:18.14]Okay.
[379:19.60]That was very creepy.
[379:21.08]Another one.
[379:59.01]You can't come through here.
[379:59.89]Would you guys rather fight one regenerator with a grenade or fight two 100 duck sized horses?
[380:11.63]Tough one.
[380:32.15]Oh, you motherfucker.
[380:33.31]Where are you?
[380:35.48]I don't know.
[380:37.02]I don't know.
[380:37.40]I don't know.
[380:37.84]I don't know.
[380:38.22]I don't know.
[380:38.64]I don't know.
[380:39.02]I don't know.
[380:43.26]I mean, I don't know.
[380:44.36]How big is the grenade, first of all?
[380:47.02]And do the duck-sized forces, do they... Are they angry or... That's a hard question.
[381:15.97]Where is he now?
[381:27.76]That's the sound I would imagine that a big duck sized horse would make.
[381:30.56]So if they're going to make sounds like that, then boy oh boy, I would want to be really prepared for them.
[381:41.77]But that's tricky.
[381:42.59]Because they might get really loud in your ears and... Dude!
[381:55.98]Die already!
[382:01.32]Ooh.
[382:10.64]You're gonna fall back in the recliner, yeah.
[382:13.36]Like... That'd be kind of funny one day if I just threw back till I have both my feet be in the air.
[382:20.53]Alright, well that is why I did that, so... I'm good now.
[382:39.87]It's getting late.
[382:41.73]Do I, um... Is chapter seven really just kind of an epilogue of, like, fight the boss chapter, or is it long?
[382:48.20]It's pretty short.
[382:57.40]Yeah.
[382:58.84]Yeah, we'll finish it.
[383:00.76]I imagine I'm getting close to the end of this chapter soon.
[383:13.44]Hold on, I need to craft some shit
[383:46.53]Unlocked.
[383:46.96]That's where the power is.
[383:59.41]Oh, wait.
[384:00.31]Power... Let me turn the beetles in.
[384:10.65]I can feel it.
[384:12.01]You're the type that gets things done.
[384:14.15]Welcome.
[384:15.35]Got a selection of good things on sale, stranger.
[384:20.21]Your valuables won't do you much well, stranger.
[384:24.85]Ten spinals, damn.
[384:25.95]Nice work.
[384:27.03]Alright, so what can I do now?
[384:28.11]We're getting kind of close to the end.
[384:29.47]I can do this.
[384:33.74]Alright, I got some treasures that I have.
[384:36.20]Hold on.
[384:40.77]Ooh.
[384:43.11]This would be good.
[384:47.29]Triple.
[384:50.17]Alright.
[384:50.75]One and a half times attack speed.
[384:54.17]I feel like is that really that big of a deal?
[385:01.04]I'm not sure I really want to spend the money on that.
[385:21.09]Yeah.
[385:21.27]Striker charm.
[385:23.11]I could buy the rocket launcher and just store it.
[385:26.75]Yeah, that's what I'm doing.
[385:34.55]Just hold on to it.
[385:35.53]Can I buy rockets?
[385:44.64]I don't always have this in stock, stranger.
[385:54.64]I should probably just do some upgrades to this.
[385:57.06]Just a handgun.
[385:59.30]It's a one-time use.
[386:06.05]Maybe I just hold the money?
[386:08.81]That's good work, if I do say so myself.
[386:15.73]I want this information commodity these days.
[386:29.44]Ruby's all rubbish.
[386:30.46]He makes no difference.
[386:32.06]Did I get a bunch of those arrows?
[386:34.08]Blast arrows are choice to make.
[386:35.84]They already sell them.
[386:41.18]I'll hold the money.
[386:44.52]Get a TV dinner table.
[386:50.42]I actually think I'm probably going to have one.
[386:53.57]Alright, let's do it.
[387:06.15]I'm going to put it in.
[387:16.27]There are four people fighting in the chat right now.
[387:20.36]Well, tell them to stop.
[387:22.38]I'm going to have to pee one more time before the finale.
[387:41.14]So I will do that after this.
[388:00.73]Not exactly covert, but it'll have to do.
[388:08.13]Highly sensitive antenna array on the island is finally complete.
[388:13.46]Browser.
[388:17.38]Real bastard, isn't it?
[388:42.38]Excuse me
[389:34.78]You suck at the gun.
[389:38.46]Run it back for a second.
[389:39.40]I don't think I missed one shot that whole ride.
[389:42.69]Not my favorite carnival ride.
[390:10.12]Oh, let's just go ahead and take care of that right now.
[390:27.78]Giant insects.
[390:34.22]Really?
[390:34.48]I can't just destroy them or something.
[390:55.04]Why not try your hand at a new gun?
[390:59.21]Might save you next time.
[391:00.85]I'm going to make a bunch of handgun ammo.
[391:05.89]And I'm going to upgrade the handgun.
[391:13.63]I'm going to get the Punisher.
[391:14.46]And I'm going to upgrade it.
[391:16.04]I guarantee it.
[391:24.38]That's a good idea.
[391:32.91]The red nine is cool, but I want to be able to go fast.
[391:40.11]I did the red nine in the last playthrough.
[391:41.99]Let's do Punisher.

[393:22.82]Ada, you can see it from here.
[393:24.66]Why did you need to put the glasses on?
[393:36.44]Although, a few hours ago, everyone was sitting there going, how the fuck does he not see this?
[393:44.84]How can he not see that he can, like, you know, the shields and shit?
[393:48.88]Ada, actually, you know what?

[393:58.03]I didn't see it either, alright?
[394:10.47]Why are you running so slow?
[394:11.75]I'm still alive!
[394:29.18]What the fuck?!
[394:31.33]I wanted the money.
[394:36.97]I wanted the money so bad.
[394:47.41]A radio tower.
[394:49.33]That's where I need to go.
[394:53.49]I thought I was in reach.
[394:54.31]I probably turn him off and can just come back out here.
[395:18.39]Really?
[395:18.67]Really?
[396:05.15]Who did was he double fisting Molotov cocktails?
[396:12.51]OK, just take.

[396:36.67]Alright, there's a big scary guy over here.
[396:55.39]Alright, I'm not doing that.
[396:57.65]I'm glad I turned around.
[396:58.69]Holy shit, oh my God.
[397:57.56]I'm not going to blow these up yet.
[397:58.48]There's probably a big guy that comes out.
[397:59.70]There's a full baseball swing.
[398:33.37]One of three bug Buster.
[398:35.15]Oh OK.
[398:41.51]My maximum XL.
[398:44.35]I think so.
[398:44.63]Alright, there's two more to turn off, so I gotta go over here.
[399:01.28]I go through this hole.
[399:04.13]No.
[399:08.25]Alright, so you can turn it.
[399:18.92]Out of the way.
[399:35.78]Yeah, no.

[399:43.42]Come on, come on, come on, come on, turn it, turn it, go go go go go go go.
[400:03.00]Oh, you've got to be fucking kidding me.
[400:22.00]We're good.
[400:31.00]He's standing with a very large backpack on, but I'm just like... Running.
[400:52.27]I gotta conserve my ammo in the machine gun.
[401:12.20]Alright.
[401:34.03]How does that help me?
[401:50.76]Oh shit, thanks.
[402:00.89]more across the bridge.
[402:14.15]Alright.
[402:14.79]Can I get these?
[402:15.79]I'm being very lazy right now and it's stupid, but whatever.
[402:18.46]I got it.
[402:30.15]I got let me reload the other weapons.
[402:31.63]It's not quite safe to go out there.
[402:47.76]I could have killed somebody.
[402:56.05]Wait a minute, did I?
[403:33.22]Did I not?
[403:35.88]He killed the gunman.
[403:37.86]Not over there.
[403:38.42]Did I fuck it up?
[403:41.20]I think I'm going to screw this up.
[403:49.52]This is bringing me all the way back here.
[403:50.96]The lasers are aiming at me.
[403:57.86]Check the other bunker.
[404:01.32]But I jumped down, though, didn't I?
[404:03.01]Can I get back over there without getting killed by the lasers?
[404:07.22]Hold on, let me go over here.
[404:31.74]Oh, okay.
[404:32.06]Alright, there we go.
[404:37.80]That does it.
[404:38.34]Now the question is, wait, can I go across here?
[404:55.64]I definitely can.
[404:59.54]But let me go get all the items.
[405:07.11]stuff only 600 that's all that was over there two gun powders and 600 bucks to disable both machine guns no it's got to be like a secret in here yeah gold bar a large gold bar thank you I was gonna say
[405:39.64]Okay, can I go across this or am I dead?
[405:43.00]Fuck it, I'm going.
[406:06.52]That's all of them.
[406:10.60]Yay.
[406:14.76]Yay.
[406:30.83]Why would they keep those barrels in there?
[406:32.21]For fuel!
[406:32.91]Where do you think they get the fuel?
[406:45.66]Ada, you are strong.
[406:46.98]Holy smokes.
[406:58.18]My god.
[406:58.72]This is ridiculous.
[407:01.75]This is one of the worst things I've ever seen in my entire life.
[407:11.49]Uh, yeah, cut, cut, cut.
[407:13.74]Larry, the boom's in the fucking shot again.
[407:17.16]Cut.
[407:18.08]Get back to one.
[407:25.01]Come on, man.
[407:26.19]That was a good take.
[407:45.36]Don't ever eat a bag of potato chips before you put in a fucking secret code, alright guys?
[407:59.25]I'm just imagining somebody being like, coming in, yup.
[408:05.41]I had a bunch of like fried chicken for dinner.
[408:15.62]Research OK.
[408:19.98]Something tells me this isn't just a car.
[408:23.94]There is that he's funny tonight.
[408:27.52]It's been a wide range of emotions tonight, I will say.
[408:29.98]I just break this.
[408:53.90]Okay.
[408:55.34]The effects of the Amber are greater than anything I could have imagined.
[408:59.10]Martinico was once a fragile, uncontrollable test subject.
[409:04.53]Okay.
[409:05.45]Impervious to conventional weapons.
[409:09.39]Now for the bad news.
[409:10.15]It may be stronger, but its mental capacity has not improved at all.
[409:13.73]Alright, so I can't hurt whatever this is with regular weapons.
[409:25.57]This treasures in here.
[409:26.65]Wait a minute.
[409:27.29]I'm just going to blow through this.
[409:32.76]The ceiling or what?
[409:40.86]OK, let's go.
[410:10.94]Oh, you can't hurt him with regular weapons.
[410:34.59]I gotta go.
[410:34.93]I think I have to put steam on him.
[410:42.80]What the heck?
[410:43.76]Just don't even look, just go.
[410:44.92]Right above me?
[411:12.58]Oh my goodness.
[411:14.12]Oh my goodness.
[411:15.90]Guess my new friend was the result of some experiment.
[411:41.15]Darth Vader is going to come down this hallway and start swinging his fucking axe.
[411:47.71]Made out of Sith energy, red, Sith crystal weaponry.
[411:58.03]Oh, my God.
[411:58.93]No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no.
[412:01.85]Cancel, cancel, cancel.
[412:06.57]How do I, how do I remove it?
[412:08.72]How do I remove it?
[412:14.05]I'm really glad that the monsters are sitting behind me like... Yep.
[412:20.55]Oops.
[412:41.71]This doesn't open.
[412:55.55]Oh, OK.
[412:57.89]We should be working together.
[412:58.83]Of course not though.
[413:08.04]Oh yeah, that's gonna be worth.
[413:11.78]Millions.
[413:23.46]Okay.
[413:23.78]Okay.
[413:29.13]Sadly came to me.
[413:31.13]It's going to be a long night.
[413:35.51]Okay.
[413:36.89]This is where it's going to get.
[413:38.23]I imagine this is probably a cutscene boss.
[413:43.84]Because I can't hurt it with my guns.
[413:45.94]So it's probably a cutscene boss.
[413:50.24]Nothing else to do.
[413:51.12]Let's just go.
[414:30.43]I was trying to get him to kill me anyways.
[414:45.90]He's playing on the difficulty that you can't fail.
[415:08.39]That was really easy.
[415:22.00]I just pressed three buttons.
[415:24.64]I just picked random ones.
[415:26.09]I'm really glad because there's 6,000 buttons here.
[415:28.27]I'm glad that the combination of six that I put in a row were to disable the entire security system.
[415:34.45]What a terrible dogshit system that is, by the way.
[415:38.31]I feel like you could accidentally turn off all security.
[415:40.13]No half measures.
[416:05.84]No, I've never arranged a way for you to get back to the island.
[416:09.96]Copy that on it now.
[416:12.18]OK, Louise.
[416:29.74]What was it that you said again?
[416:33.36]You should have known by now, Whisker.
[416:35.47]Thank God they got Windows Defender.
[416:39.88]Prevent all that.
[417:15.08]Alright, where's the monster?
[417:15.84]Let's go.
[417:25.39]He's got jokes tonight.
[417:27.25]They're just coming out.
[417:27.95]1, 2, 3, 4, 5.
[417:28.49]Turn the lasers on.
[417:29.71]Mm-hmm.
[417:45.27]I'm gonna laugh my ass off.
[417:46.29]Imagine he did acrobatic dives and shit through this.
[417:48.41]It's working.
[418:16.30]Her head that hit the ground.
[418:22.76]Jesus.
[418:30.13]That was fucking crazy.
[418:38.79]It looks like we're doing it together.
[418:40.07]C, okay, I can press C.
[418:45.64]C, G. Was it C or B?
[418:49.74]Oh!
[418:51.34]Sorry.
[418:53.98]What's the next one?
[418:55.60]Uh, it's, uh, it's shift.
[419:00.53]Shift?
[419:01.63]Hey, I don't have a fucking computer.
[419:03.49]I don't have a keyboard.
[419:04.39]I don't have a keyboard.
[419:07.19]Oh, no.
[419:14.72]That was, yeah, that was pretty good.
[419:34.86]They don't go that fast.
[419:37.80]They're shot out of a cannon.
[419:40.16]That wasn't even on a jet ski.
[419:47.57]Imagine turning on a jet ski and just pressing the gas and you're just out of a cannon.
[419:52.65]Alright, let's do it.
[419:57.75]Thanks for staying up late.
[419:59.77]There's still quite a few people here.
[420:01.71]I'm just chilling.
[420:05.45]You should go pee.
[420:10.67]Yeah, I will after this cutscene.
[420:29.78]How much longer will the stream be?
[420:31.82]I'm about to beat the game, so when that ends, the stream ends.
[420:40.65]Leon's headed for their sanctuary.
[420:42.99]I'll meet him there.
[420:44.15]OK.
[420:44.25]We're just going.
[420:49.78]Wait, stop.
[420:51.52]Nope.
[421:02.48]Imagine this is probably the final time I'll see you.
[421:05.24]So let's just upgrade everything.
[421:08.42]Buy everything.
[421:09.29]Okay.
[421:10.31]I can do three.
[421:14.97]Two and... Wait, I think I actually can buy it.
[421:18.19]Can I?
[421:18.41]Can I actually purchase it?
[421:27.83]Damn it.
[421:28.37]I will.
[421:32.63]Do I have... I'm at the end of the game.
[421:35.93]It doesn't really matter.
[421:36.59]Who cares?
[421:36.91]I was going to sell everything.
[421:50.12]Oh, yeah.
[421:50.72]I got a P. I'll be right back.
[421:53.58]And then we'll finish the game up.
[424:48.39]Hello.
[424:52.37]I have returned.
[425:00.82]You guys ready to finish this up?
[425:01.66]Let's finish this up.
[425:08.29]So.
[425:11.53]Might as well just buy everything I can.
[425:22.07]maxed out a well-tuned weapon there you are as you wished this kind of work is about I'm gonna shoot the um shoot the rocket launcher anyways I just get rid of all this stuff right why not
[425:50.96]Scope and everything.
[425:55.66]Who cares?
[426:00.24]A deal well struck.
[426:04.09]Better to be over-prepared.
[426:06.81]Am I right?
[426:11.03]Dazzled, are you?
[426:13.07]I'll keep a lookout.
[426:24.02]I have the rocket launcher.
[426:25.50]Yeah, I do.
[426:30.54]You look like a 60 year old that collects knives.
[426:33.95]That's a good one.
[426:41.23]That's a good one.
[426:47.59]Alright, time to end the game.
[427:04.40]Holy shit, that looks awful.
[427:37.47]Maybe I will see him again.
[427:38.79]I'm still getting money.
[427:42.65]Wait.
[427:54.03]What the fuck?
[428:08.79]Why is your hair like that?
[428:10.53]Uh, is that because it is?
[428:32.33]No, do not now.
[428:44.87]I don't have very much health.
[428:59.15]I'll hold it for now.
[429:13.36]Yikes!
[429:29.11]He's still alive!
[429:33.33]Alright, good.
[429:41.43]Have you been doing alright?
[429:42.13]Yeah.
[429:43.34]Somebody asked earlier, they said this is seven hours.
[429:46.40]This is abnormal the last six months or so.
[429:53.40]It's part of the reason to be in this chair.
[429:55.36]It's so much better.
[430:08.03]Now, the frequency of the streams is going to stay the same, right?
[430:10.27]But
[430:12.89]I mean, this is not me telling you that, oh, every stream is going to be like seven to ten hours now.
[430:17.09]No, no, no.
[430:18.03]It's just I'm just much more comfortable than I was before.
[430:22.04]And it's going to improve.
[430:22.70]It's going to get better.
[430:23.22]I thought there was a stake when it first showed up on the screen.
[430:36.92]uh but yeah my intention is still to you know slow it down and everything but um I wanted to make sure this last kind of arc if you want to call it that was a lot more comfortable because I can sit here for whenever I feel like it this is exactly what I'm doing right now it's like 12 15 at night just kind of here so it's all good
[431:05.09]Oh, I am out of everything.
[431:10.18]What is going on?
[431:11.14]Why am I playing, like, Call of Duty World at War?
[431:19.19]What happened?
[431:20.19]Oh, I sold the fucking scope.
[431:37.10]Wait.
[431:37.76]Treasure.
[431:38.06]But it doesn't really matter.
[431:38.98]We're done.
[431:39.58]But I just see the thing on the map and I want to go look at it and get it.
[431:41.96]I'm glad I did.
[431:44.56]It's a big one.
[431:47.07]What is it?
[431:48.63]Staff of royalty.
[431:49.99]Okay.
[432:04.32]End of career voice.
[432:11.69]Hey, I'm here right now.
[432:14.41]And I plan on staying here.
[432:15.93]Just at a much reduced capacity like we talked about before.
[432:20.69]But we don't have to talk about that.
[432:23.33]We're playing Resident Evil.
[432:24.81]We don't have to talk about that.
[432:26.83]Hey, remember when I couldn't flip the fucking puzzle?
[432:29.76]Bring that up.
[432:56.46]Okay, I hear it.
[432:57.86]Where is it?
[432:58.32]Right there.
[433:07.46]Use the rocket launcher?
[433:08.42]Right now?
[433:09.72]I have one shot in this.
[433:15.59]I don't want to just use it on a regular guy that just opens the door up.
[433:36.93]I don't know.
[433:37.25]The door could have been made of fucking... I don't know why I'm doing this.
[433:41.43]Why am I conducting an orchestra?
[433:44.27]Join our covenant.
[433:46.57]Oh, blessings unto him and the sweet mercy they bring.
[433:50.73]Exalt all and let it be sung.
[433:56.73]This fucking hat.
[434:25.56]So that's what happened.
[434:57.86]He dies instantly?
[435:00.13]He didn't even get to say his fucking line.
[435:03.75]Restart now.
[435:04.37]No, he's still alive.
[435:06.37]That was not the end.
[435:08.75]He's still alive.
[435:33.58]Yeah, he comes back and he's like, it's me and I... Yeah, because we're up here.
[435:40.75]I remember this.
[435:43.65]I definitely should not have used the rocket launcher there, but whatever.
[435:57.01]Oh, that was funny.
[436:10.52]I don't even know what that boss fight's like.
[436:13.00]Should I just actually play it?
[436:27.18]Yeah, that's all that matters is I won, that's right.
[436:45.27]I wish I had a second round.
[437:21.83]Obtain a powerful weapon.
[437:24.25]OK.
[437:27.30]I got the shiny thing on the ground first.
[437:28.72]Alright, let's go.
[437:32.32]You're doing great down there, Leon.
[437:49.26]Ooh, a rocket launcher.
[437:52.41]I wish I had one of those.
[437:53.45]Oh shit, I do have to hurry.
[438:20.17]Just go, go, go.
[438:21.06]What?
[438:21.56]What am I doing?
[438:22.11]Run.
[438:54.49]Go!
[438:56.05]Go!
[438:56.27]What is that?
[439:04.16]What is that?
[439:04.58]What is that?
[439:05.24]What is that?
[439:32.25]That was a crazy explosion.
[439:33.25]What are you doing?
[439:41.92]Shoot it!
[439:47.05]Oh my god, dude.
[439:48.73]What are you doing?
[440:01.95]I thought that was a red barrel.
[440:03.62]They ain't gonna shoot me in point blank.
[440:35.16]Oh, deja vu.
[440:36.78]That's right.
[440:37.26]I'm getting sick of your shit.
[440:53.15]So in this playthrough then, who does Ada shoot or does Leon shoot it?
[440:57.23]It's Leon, definitely.
[441:01.45]They wouldn't retcon the whole game.
[441:05.45]OK, it's a it's a it's a big one.
[441:19.71]Not in my inventory.
[441:21.47]It's just it's it's a cut scene.
[441:22.93]I get it.
[441:31.34]Please bugs even doing here still.
[441:46.27]Good.
[442:19.09]Ashley.
[442:20.73]Oh, yeah.
[442:38.53]I'm on it.
[442:52.26]No, don't throw a grenade over there.
[442:54.29]You got two minutes.
[443:10.35]With seconds to spare.
[443:32.98]I feel like that would explode.
[443:37.35]Wouldn't that just blow up?
[444:06.99]Ada, what the hell are you doing?
[444:34.76]Nada's just so calm and collected.
[444:59.74]I feel like at the end of this, she gets back.
[445:01.92]I see.
[445:02.28]Goes into her house, her apartment, wherever it is.
[445:04.78]Grabs the pillow.
[445:07.14]And just holds it here and just... And just fucking screams.
[445:16.04]Better get a move on.
[445:24.64]Cute.
[445:30.18]Until next time, Leon.
[445:35.10]Leon!
[445:40.50]Hello, it's Wesker.
[445:42.85]Where's my stuff?
[445:44.25]Where's my kyber crystal?
[445:45.59]My lightsaber?
[445:47.89]It's a yellow one.
[445:49.71]My favorite.
[445:51.11]Catch me through.
[445:52.25]Yellow means that you're intelligent and not evil and smart.
[445:55.67]I've obtained the Amber.
[445:56.95]That's what all the nerds want is their lightsaber.
[445:58.57]Excellent.
[445:59.59]That or purple.
[446:01.51]Just one question.
[446:03.59]What are you planning to do with this?
[446:04.87]I do not pay you to ask questions.
[446:09.67]I wanted a yellow lightsaber when I was in.
[446:11.09]All you need to know is a new dawn is breaking.
[446:13.98]That was a self-report.
[446:15.08]A hundred will give their lives so that just one may live.
[446:20.72]I am expediting that change.
[446:26.53]Wesker, why, like... What's wrong with this guy?
[447:03.09]That was good.
[447:11.40]That was really fun.
[447:16.92]What was that?
[447:17.38]Seven hours?
[447:18.02]Seven and a half?
[447:18.88]Well, that's, you know, take like an hour and 45 minutes away from the puzzles that I did, but... What's the total game time?
[447:26.79]Five hours?
[447:27.17]Five and a half?
[447:32.21]That was good.
[447:32.73]You can play city skylines too.
[447:43.38]Oh yeah, absolutely.
[447:44.96]I say for sure.
[447:56.55]Post credits.
[448:10.27]Did you play Mortal Kombat?
[448:11.53]Just for a little bit.
[448:12.97]I tried it out for a few hours.
[448:14.27]I'm just not very good at fighting games.
[448:20.41]Fighting games are really fun to watch, but they're not really fun to play for me.
[448:26.06]Fighting games are kind of like puzzle games in my brain.
[448:29.50]A series of very specific actions have to happen in a very specific order, or you lose.
[448:45.58]Real-time puzzle games.
[448:46.92]Yeah.
[448:52.41]Isn't that every video game?
[448:55.35]Um, well, very specific actions.
[449:00.46]In the context of... Hold on, let me sit up.
[449:04.58]Hold on.
[449:04.78]We gotta sit up for this one.
[449:10.77]You know what I mean when I say that.
[449:14.56]You have to do a very specific set of actions to be able to do these moves and to be able to predict what your opponent will do.
[449:24.57]This is every video game.
[449:28.01]I saw a lot of trues, though.
[449:29.25]You guys know what I mean.
[449:30.75]We got to read between the lines here.
[449:40.81]It's real.
[449:42.17]Shit.
[449:42.41]Okay, so in a puzzle game... Well, you can play a lot of games in different ways.
[449:48.53]Like, I can press W and then let go, and I'll be fine.
[449:54.28]Right?
[449:54.74]Like, if I just walk forward in a fighting game and stop moving, it's over.
[449:58.12]I'm gonna get combo'd and I'm dead.
[450:01.45]You have to string together a very specific set of actions in a row.
[450:08.74]There's no time for you to stop.
[450:10.94]You can't just stop playing.
[450:12.42]You can't just, oh, I'm going to go into my inventory for a minute.
[450:15.14]Nope.
[450:15.70]If you're not doing down forward slash B, block, jump, down forward B, jump back, down forward slash B.
[450:24.23]It's like a rhythm game.
[450:24.87]It's like a puzzle rhythm game.
[450:26.75]You have to really be paying attention every single millisecond of the time in action, everything in a row.
[450:34.50]And I don't know, I kind of like to be able to blink a few times and not worry about it.
[450:52.41]Oh, I thought this was the post credits.
[450:56.93]I like six hours.
[450:57.63]I spent an hour and 25 minutes doing nothing.
[451:02.33]I love watching fighting games.
[451:03.63]I like watching people play them.
[451:05.77]But the series of very specific actions in a row, I can't do.
[451:10.48]This is Control.
[451:13.14]You're flying off course.
[451:14.12]Report.
[451:14.28]This is Control.
[451:15.04]You're flying off course.
[451:16.80]Report.
[451:17.08]This is Control.
[451:17.46]You're flying off course.
[451:20.48]Did he see that?
[451:22.42]Wait, he got to see that rating?
[451:24.68]How long it took for me to play the game?
[451:26.28]He's watching my stream right now.
[451:27.88]Wow.
[451:30.62]He's fucking terrible.
[451:32.34]A B. Six hours of game time too.
[451:35.31]I would have figured out that puzzle really quickly.
[451:36.81]He's just watching.
[451:40.61]He's just chatting in my chat right now.
[451:42.11]Being mean to me when I had a fucking gas leak in my fucking room.
[451:50.40]I don't know why I was so bad at that.
[451:52.48]No.
[451:53.58]Oh, well, uh, yeah.
[451:55.56]Defiance changes nothing.
[451:58.50]Besides, we have all we need.
[452:05.33]We continue as planned.
[452:26.96]Soon, the sun will set on the age of man.
[452:35.75]I feel like if Wesker just took a bath, he would kind of not give a shit about this anymore.
[452:42.03]A big bubble bath with an iPad.
[452:45.60]I feel like he'd be like, you know what?
[452:46.92]Actually, I'm going to settle down.
[452:49.74]I'm just going to relax now.
[452:54.24]Don't ever underestimate what can be solved in a bath.
[452:57.53]Okay?
[452:57.69]I'm serious.
[453:09.17]Cool.
[453:19.96]I will try.
[453:21.48]Somebody said just even open it.
[453:23.74]I'm not going to try or play, but I'll just hop in and check it out.
[453:28.44]The new mercenaries.
[453:34.82]I got my points.
[453:36.64]Costume unlocked.
[453:39.29]Lots of costumes.
[453:43.03]My goodness.
[454:00.39]Why did I just buy the helicopter guy?
[454:03.81]He's in the movie for five minutes.
[454:06.07]Oh, no, no, no.
[454:07.81]Okay, it's a model.
[454:22.94]Actually, wait.
[454:23.24]I want to... Let's go back.
[454:29.12]Where do I do the...
[454:33.34]What do I do?
[454:33.66]The outfits?
[454:40.56]Oh, it's campaign only.
[454:52.35]Okay.
[455:00.52]Okay, we're going to go with
[455:03.68]A rank or above as Ada.
[455:05.44]I think I can get that pretty quickly.
[455:12.06]Green Needle.
[455:18.89]I just want to see Wesker.
[455:32.26]Because I'm probably not going to play this again anytime soon, really.
[455:41.25]Maybe I'd play it in my kind of off time, but... What do I need for A?
[455:48.79]Let's get to A and die.
[456:04.59]Oh no, it's already over.
[456:12.26]What is the mayhem mode for her?
[456:18.02]Just like good aiming?
[456:20.22]Or just one hit kills and one hit headshot kills?
[456:30.34]Seems like instant reloads.
[456:41.61]Kind of like Leon's seems pretty good.
[456:53.22]Seems pretty good.
[456:54.32]I don't lose the combo.
[457:06.69]Incoming.
[457:15.44]Where is he?
[457:31.81]Where are you?
[457:39.73]Ada's good.
[457:40.36]Ada's really fun to play.
[457:45.56]That's a Molotov.
[457:58.86]Don't lose the combo.
[457:59.88]I'm just going to let the timer now.
[458:01.76]I'll have a.
[458:20.17]Uh-oh.
[458:32.19]Where is he?
[458:47.27]Whoa!
[458:47.72]He's still alive?
[458:50.36]No, he's dead, right?
[459:09.73]Oh, no.
[459:11.05]Bad.
[459:11.41]I got to get out of the way.
[459:29.75]Oh shit.
[459:35.09]Don't throw that shit at me right now.
[459:48.45]Alright, I definitely have egg.
[460:07.93]I am in trouble, but I should be.
[460:09.70]Oh, I gotta heal.
[460:30.01]I'll keep it going, might as well.
[460:31.33]Probably get ass.
[460:47.21]Shit careful here.
[460:51.08]I Need to get the fuck out of the way
[461:15.85]Alright 326 wow wow wow wow.
[461:23.02]Oh no, I got stuck on that guy.
[461:26.98]The guy in front of me is just kind of weirdly in the way.
[461:28.74]I think that's it.
[461:39.81]I'll take an SS man.
[461:40.47]Alright Wesker.
[461:43.29]Yeah.
[461:47.29]New stage.
[461:49.61]Oh, there is docks.
[461:50.43]Alright, let's play Wesker.
[462:05.07]So what does he got?
[462:08.44]He's got the magnum.
[462:09.60]He's got the killer seven.
[462:14.80]Okay, that's that's goofy.
[462:23.91]Can't I turn into a monster or something?
[462:32.90]What about the other gun?
[462:34.02]Yeah, it's one of these.
[462:34.72]Let me see.
[462:38.78]He actually probably is the most fun to play because of the magnum.
[462:42.56]Alright, will you stop?
[462:43.45]Thank god.
[462:49.25]That was cool.
[463:00.54]Come on through.
[463:08.24]Gun's kind of slow, but still fun.
[463:09.92]Alright, mayhem mode.
[463:29.30]What is it?
[463:37.74]Oh, he does melee attacks.
[463:46.98]Alright, that's awesome.
[463:58.54]Where is he at?
[464:01.17]Oh, okay.
[464:01.57]That might be it.
[464:20.13]Did I just flip that guy off?
[464:24.93]Holy shit, I just got a lot of people there.
[464:39.48]These bugs are flying around.
[464:41.32]Okay, I get a better vantage point than this.
[465:03.23]The melee is amazing.
[465:14.54]You shithead.
[465:15.66]Whoa!
[465:28.18]Oh, I'm stuck on something.
[465:35.90]Oh God.
[465:36.62]I just kicked this guy's ass.
[465:43.60]Is he dead?
[466:00.77]Oh no, get out, get out, get out.
[466:02.31]I'm stuck in here.
[466:03.35]Oh bad, bad, bad, very bad, very bad, very bad.
[466:05.94]I'm dead.
[466:17.19]OK.
[466:17.31]I need help.
[466:25.29]Oh, I'm freezing up.
[466:36.31]Oh, too bad.
[466:52.22]Okay, that was fun.
[466:54.08]He's cool.
[466:58.68]That's still an S.
[467:04.50]Alright, everybody.
[467:05.36]It is late.
[467:06.74]Thanks for watching.
[467:07.40]Thanks for hanging out.
[467:08.02]I'll see you guys on Monday for Party Animals with Ster and maybe Vinny.
[467:12.25]And then maybe one or two others.
[467:14.01]Maybe we'll cycle some people in and out.
[467:15.37]Thanks for watching.
[467:28.38]Uh, somebody said to give a rating to separate ways.
[467:32.02]I kind of think it's just part of Resident Evil 4.
[467:36.00]Which is a 9.5.
[467:38.06]To me, it's just another few chapters extended onto the game.
[467:52.65]Resident Evil 4 is a great game.
[467:55.49]It's just a remake of that.
[467:57.07]It was a little different though.
[467:57.97]I don't remember a lot of those encounters in separate ways.
[468:00.47]Did I even... I don't know if I played separate ways.
[468:05.18]Maybe I did.
[468:05.62]Do you like puzzles?
[468:14.10]Well, the problem is I get like in a feedback loop where I get stuck on something and then I try to go as fast as I can to fix it.
[468:24.47]And then it makes it even worse.
[468:33.21]But I was fine.
[468:33.79]It was fine.
[468:35.68]I can just be kind of a dummy sometimes, but it's OK.
[468:38.74]We have our strengths.
[468:39.48]We have our weaknesses.
[468:42.14]One of my weaknesses is shooting at shields on a ball.
[468:48.48]In the correct order.
[468:53.35]Lies of P is my favorite Souls-like that isn't FromSoftware.
[468:58.25]Damn.
[468:58.85]Okay.
[469:03.01]Saw X was really good, too.
[469:04.53]Damn.
[469:05.09]Okay, I'm getting some pretty good recommendations right now of things I thought I might want to do.
[469:16.07]But yeah, I'll see you guys Monday.
[469:17.20]Thanks for watching.
[469:19.85]It's the first almost 8 hour stream in a long time.
[469:21.73]It's not going to be the norm.
[469:25.11]But it is possible.
[469:29.13]See you guys on Monday.
[469:34.42]Take care.
[469:35.72]Call your mother.
[469:37.92]You know what to do.
[469:40.82]See you soon.
[470:35.94]you
[471:10.82]you
