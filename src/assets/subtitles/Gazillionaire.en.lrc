[00:49.83]That's right, everybody.
[00:51.39]For one night only, we're here to do some streaming.
[00:57.77]I'm not that sick.
[00:58.41]Don't worry.
[01:04.01]Everyone's like, oh my God, he must be sick.
[01:06.93]No, I'm good.
[01:08.39]I'm good.
[01:11.89]Doing good.
[01:15.41]Just chilling, hanging out.
[01:18.63]You know what?
[01:19.15]I figured I would, you know, do some chill time.
[01:23.43]Play a game, hang out for a little bit.
[01:25.22]Like I said, I want to do a few days ago.
[01:32.48]This is the best day ever.
[01:35.42]It's the best day ever.
[01:44.36]Yeah, we're gonna play Gazillionaire.
[01:46.22]You never heard of Gazillionaire?
[01:48.17]You're in for a treat.
[01:53.61]You gonna play Boletro?
[01:55.11]No, we're playing Gazillionaire.
[01:59.32]It's a business simulator.
[02:02.08]Where you're in outer space.
[02:03.98]There's all kinds of goofy characters.
[02:06.80]There's all kinds of funny things that can happen to you.
[02:10.62]You buy and sell commodities in outer space.
[02:19.71]And I've wanted to play it for a pretty long time.
[02:22.70]And what a perfect opportunity to play it now.
[02:25.22]These are geriatric stream hours.
[02:31.00]Yeah.
[02:34.39]Welcome to my world.
[02:41.07]Can you say hi to my dog?
[02:43.89]What's the dog's name?
[02:46.00]Argo?
[02:48.24]Here, Argo.
[02:49.12]Argo.
[02:49.50]Here, boy.
[02:50.36]Here, Argo.
[02:51.10]Argo.
[02:51.84]Here, Argo.
[02:52.34]Did it work?
[03:02.00]Can you say hi to me after the dog?
[03:07.30]Can you say hi to me, too, instead of just a dog?
[03:14.79]Alright, let's go.
[03:17.15]We have some very important things to do.
[03:19.55]I think me and Ster are still doing bingo tomorrow.
[03:23.01]I gotta confirm.
[03:24.07]We'll see.
[03:25.15]I know we're playing EDF this week.
[03:27.05]Or at the end of this next week.
[03:29.95]So there is stuff on tap.
[03:31.77]You will see me again.
[03:33.69]In the next six or seven days.
[03:35.63]Whether it's bingo, whether it's EDF.
[03:37.67]We'll find out.
[03:42.84]We are eating good.
[03:46.94]Just for one day only.
[03:49.43]Yeah, just for one day.
[03:50.23]Alright, you guys ready?
[03:53.79]Let's take a look.
[03:56.71]There it is.
[03:58.57]There are funny sound effects in this game, if you didn't know.
[04:03.53]You got milk voice today?
[04:05.69]Yeah, I've had milk voice for the last, like, week.
[04:08.81]I have milk voice every day.
[04:11.33]That's just what happens.
[04:13.46]I'm starting to realize this.
[04:14.48]A few things I'm realizing as I'm getting a little older.
[04:17.51]Milk voice is an everyday thing.
[04:24.15]It used to be once a week I'd have milk voice.
[04:27.35]Now it's everyday.
[04:29.71]You know what?
[04:30.34]Whatever.
[04:31.40]If that's the way it is, that's what we're going to do.
[04:33.26]We're going to have milk voice.
[04:34.36]It's a lifestyle.
[04:39.83]Alright, you guys ready?
[04:41.47]So we're not doing this on expert.
[04:43.53]This game is incredibly difficult.
[04:45.39]I don't think I can even do this on novice.
[04:47.75]I will try it on beginner.
[04:51.96]Quick do a Tom Hanks impression.
[04:55.52]It's funny because Holly and I will sit around and it'll happen.
[05:00.54]And I'll be like, quick, quick, nobody move.
[05:01.96]Don't move.
[05:02.62]Holly, don't move.
[05:04.53]Sometimes it'd be like, slowly take out your phone and hit the record button.
[05:10.34]And then it's gone by the time we start recording.
[05:13.70]The tutorial is actually a big help for this.
[05:15.72]I have done it already.
[05:17.53]I am prepared.
[05:19.59]We're going to do beginner.
[05:22.61]Did you hear that sound effect?
[05:25.87]These are the amount of humans you can have.
[05:27.19]We're only going to do one.
[05:27.93]Alright, here are all the planets.
[05:32.56]They can be randomized, right?
[05:34.38]So it doesn't really matter.
[05:36.00]What do you think?
[05:37.90]What do you think we got a good one?
[05:46.86]That's pretty good.
[05:50.17]Alright, one more.
[05:53.33]One more after that.
[05:54.99]Perfect.
[05:56.91]No, one more.
[05:57.43]Okay.
[05:58.95]Okay.
[06:01.07]Alright, so these are the planets that we can travel to.
[06:09.40]He's gambling?
[06:11.26]I mean, this technically is gambling, I guess, like for the different planets.
[06:18.80]Oh no, Hork is gone now.
[06:22.28]We need a Hork planet.
[06:25.50]Do we?
[06:28.62]Okay, we have a Hork now.
[06:29.96]Is everybody happy?
[06:30.74]Is everybody enjoying themselves now?
[06:34.57]It's gotta be Hork.
[06:36.03]Alright, well this, but okay, the planets don't, okay, they do matter.
[06:40.45]But not, okay, okay, I think I'm good with this.
[06:44.22]Here are the competition.
[06:46.68]We have Gizzy Shipping.
[06:49.98]Freewheeling and Chaotic.
[06:51.76]Trading Corp.
[06:53.92]Vandergriff LTD Limited.
[06:57.62]Hoffmeister.
[06:59.30]Roke Transport.
[07:00.34]And Puffer Incorporated.
[07:02.96]So we have to beat all these other bastards in the industry.
[07:08.03]Okay.
[07:11.37]So this is the name of the company.
[07:13.83]I'm going to say.
[07:14.45]How about like.
[07:20.03]How about elite commodities forever?
[07:33.23]How about just elite commodities?
[07:36.91]It adds boring.
[07:37.67]That's fine.
[07:38.21]It doesn't have to be crazy.
[07:40.35]This is a shell company name.
[07:47.33]This is not a funny name.
[07:48.67]It doesn't have to be a funny name.
[07:53.96]Shell Company.
[07:56.08]Oh yeah, I own a few businesses.
[07:59.24]Elite Commodities is one.
[08:02.80]Elite Gardening.
[08:05.02]I also own Elite Shell Company.
[08:09.51]I own Elite Flooring.
[08:11.33]I own Elite Tiling.
[08:16.79]Elite Elite.
[08:21.99]Hmm.
[08:24.05]It doesn't really matter.
[08:28.80]Elite grind set.
[08:32.26]I like this.
[08:34.20]That's how you know you gotta watch the fuck out for us.
[08:39.37]That's how you know you gotta watch out.
[08:42.79]Alright, this is the most important thing of the entire afternoon.
[08:45.99]What is our ship?
[08:47.43]Each ship has a song.
[08:49.91]Are you ready?
[08:59.89]Okay, that one kind of hurts.
[09:00.81]Alright, do we want the wasp?
[09:07.25]120,000 is how much it costs.
[09:10.68]Passengers... There is a point to having passengers.
[09:15.82]Smaller fuel tank.
[09:17.78]All this matters.
[09:18.46]Flycatcher.
[09:22.54]120 tons.
[09:25.32]Uh...
[09:29.38]We could do Lev Rock.
[09:34.15]I kind of want to do Lev Rock.
[09:37.15]Only 80 tons of cargo.
[09:38.25]That's not a whole lot.
[09:43.36]Dude, the Lev Rock, definitely.
[09:44.78]Okay.
[09:46.20]This is a whaler.
[09:47.14]It has a ton of space.
[09:52.12]Okay, so this is a buy low, sell high game.
[09:54.95]That's almost the entire game.
[09:58.82]That's a lot of space.
[10:00.48]It does need a lot of crew though.
[10:04.22]Crew costs money.
[10:05.23]Eyeball's pretty cool.
[10:09.71]Only three crew members.
[10:12.01]This music goes really hard too.
[10:24.91]I don't really care about the passengers that much.
[10:26.67]You can taxi people around from planet to planet.
[10:33.02]Cerebralis.
[10:37.60]Eight?
[10:37.92]This thing seems pretty great.
[10:38.94]The Globulizer.
[10:41.53]Seven passengers.
[10:41.97]I want to be able to carry a lot of stuff.
[10:56.36]This one's not bad.
[10:58.24]Locomotus.
[11:01.28]The Mantagon.
[11:02.52]Only three crew members.
[11:05.16]This is important because it costs a lot of money.
[11:10.18]The themes are not unique.
[11:11.48]Some of them are.
[11:11.94]How about the Kegger?
[11:16.53]No.
[11:19.87]Worm Shuttle.
[11:21.15]12 crew.
[11:21.69]Oh my god.
[11:22.55]That's a lot of people.
[11:23.45]16 passengers.
[11:28.01]That's a small cargo bay, but that's... That's a lot of money to operate.
[11:31.53]I don't think it's gonna be this one.
[11:32.45]It's too advanced.
[11:36.77]Hmm... I'm thinking Eyeball.
[11:46.68]Or, uh, Le Rock.
[11:48.76]Alright, Le Rock or Eyeball.
[11:54.46]Which one?
[11:55.38]I'm gonna let you decide.
[11:58.13]Please cast your vote in the chat.
[12:00.57]One, if you'd like to see LeRoc.
[12:03.88]Two, if you'd like to see the eyeball.
[12:07.70]It's your decision.
[12:10.44]Post and chat now.
[12:17.77]Okay.
[12:19.97]Seeing a lot of twos.
[12:24.85]Seeing a ton of twos.
[12:25.89]That's an overwhelming amount of twos.
[12:30.92]What order was it again?
[12:33.04]Was 2 the eyeball?
[12:34.56]I don't even remember my own poll.
[12:35.96]I don't even know my own poll.
[12:41.08]It's the iconic Jerma eye.
[12:46.68]I have blue eyes.
[12:47.81]Do you know anything about me?
[12:53.55]Alright, we're gonna do eye.
[12:55.29]We're doing the retina ship.
[12:58.74]Okay, here we go.
[12:59.82]Mr. Zinn, a wealthy and somewhat fickle financer, generously loans you the 120,000 kubars, which is money, necessary to get your company going.
[13:11.28]However, you must pay Mr. Zinn 4% interest per week.
[13:15.34]Mr. Zinn wishes you the best of luck on your new venture and hopes he will never have to repossess your ship.
[13:20.70]Alright, this is the first week.
[13:24.56]The goal of this game per week?
[13:27.44]Yeah, it's fucked up.
[13:33.84]And then that's where the beat starts.
[13:36.36]What an awesome sampling that would be.
[13:41.09]What was it?
[13:41.67]Oh, yeah.
[13:42.13]Okay, you have to get to $5 million.
[13:45.51]So once you hit $5 million, you win the game.
[13:47.77]So everybody is kind of in the same position right now.
[13:49.64]We all got loaned $120,000.
[13:50.38]So who can come out on top?
[13:56.86]Okay.
[13:57.30]This is the, this is Quaig.
[14:00.94]Here's everybody's net worth.
[14:01.96]Not going to be really everyone, the market strength.
[14:03.98]We all, you know, it doesn't really matter.
[14:05.16]Okay.
[14:06.70]So here we go.
[14:09.25]The goal is, so here's this, a marketplace is the total supply.
[14:13.79]I, for a second, I was like, what the fuck does this mean?
[14:17.89]That's the name of the company, right?
[14:19.53]Okay.
[14:19.75]So we have a marketplace.
[14:22.07]This is on the planet.
[14:25.74]Quaig, this is everything that's available to buy on Quaig.
[14:31.12]Here's the price, and here's the price range.
[14:34.84]Now, if you please move yourself over to supply, you can see where on Quaig right now, the things that are in high supply, for instance, Babel seeds, are not expensive.
[14:49.30]If you take the Babel seeds, if I buy a bunch of Babel seeds, and I bring them to Mira,
[14:55.72]They don't have a whole lot of Babel seeds.
[14:58.12]They're actually in need of Babel seeds, which we can sell at a premium.
[15:03.98]Is this what you do at your job?
[15:07.48]Yeah, I just sit in the corner and count hair tonics and Babel seeds.
[15:12.86]That's all I do.
[15:16.90]This is his favorite thing to do.
[15:19.12]Yeah, I just kick my feet under the desk and like play with coins at the desk.
[15:26.96]Hey, hey, Ludwig.
[15:28.80]Hey, dude.
[15:30.20]Do you know that there's a huge oversupply of babble seeds on Quag right now?
[15:36.73]And he just walks by the office door.
[15:41.33]I don't think he said anything ever.
[15:47.95]That's such a textbook.
[15:52.56]That's a textbook math problem.
[15:56.65]We're going to learn together.
[16:09.67]You need to get disgustingly rich off buying and selling cantaloupe.
[16:13.23]Well, it's funny you say that because Frack needs it.
[16:17.16]Here's how you play this game.
[16:20.10]You go to... Okay, polyester.
[16:23.40]We're going to buy a shitload of polyester right now.
[16:27.44]And we're immediately bringing it right to Loro.
[16:31.02]So marketplace, uh, polyester.
[16:36.56]I don't have any money.
[16:39.57]Right.
[16:43.17]Okay.
[16:43.97]So we're going to take our way over to the bank.
[16:46.93]Uh, we're going to open up the door.
[16:48.85]We're going to ask for a, just a little loan here.
[16:51.43]I have a hundred thousand dollar credit limit.
[16:57.99]I'm going to borrow $25,000.
[17:00.35]Okay.
[17:04.55]Now, polyester, I'm going to buy all of it.
[17:10.52]How much is that going to cost?
[17:12.66]Okay.
[17:12.86]That was about $10,000.
[17:15.57]This better have been worth it, or I'm going to put both of my feet through my monitor.
[17:21.16]I'm going to lean back in my chair, both feet going to go in the air directly parallel to the screen, and I'm going to do a double kick, two full kick into the screen.
[17:31.39]I'm going to try to go through it.
[17:33.89]So let's see.
[17:38.01]Okay, so now I need to go to Loro.
[17:42.56]Just to show you how this all works.
[17:45.06]Here we are.
[17:46.16]We need to go to Loro.
[17:47.82]Let's fly.
[17:48.38]That hurts so bad.
[17:51.69]And I hope it's not as loud for you as it is for me.
[17:53.63]Because that was awful.
[17:55.27]I'm telling you, that would be pretty big.
[18:10.39]Okay, we're on Loro, the pleasure planet.
[18:14.73]It's over.
[18:16.93]Alright, you have to pay taxes.
[18:21.55]I'm not paying taxes yet.
[18:23.47]See crew wages?
[18:24.60]Look at this.
[18:25.86]I only have $13,000.
[18:26.68]It's like all my money.
[18:29.56]Your crew's morale is high and everyone seems to be happy.
[18:31.58]We're good.
[18:32.48]Okay, marketplace.
[18:33.74]How are we doing on supply?
[18:37.17]Yep, 25%.
[18:39.55]Check this out.
[18:40.87]Boom.
[18:41.77]Sell it all.
[18:43.51]That is a $17,000 profit.
[18:46.55]We are doing so good.
[18:51.59]Alright, so what's here?
[18:55.63]Okay, we can go back to Quaig.
[18:59.23]I think we buy Cryptoons.
[19:02.01]We're going to buy Cryptoons and Oxygen.
[19:04.20]And we're bringing it right back to Quaig.
[19:09.96]Yeah, because that 1%, that's awful.
[19:13.39]We'll see who has worse.
[19:14.25]Probably this one.
[19:15.17]Alright.
[19:17.23]Cryptoons and just Cryptoons.
[19:23.31]I think these are going to be expensive, right?
[19:29.01]Okay.
[19:29.59]So I have 38.
[19:31.10]You know what?
[19:31.42]Just buy the X fields too.
[19:32.46]I have enough room.
[19:35.96]What else is in low supply here?
[19:41.90]Oxygen, Cryptoons, and then Exotics.
[19:45.38]I'll buy Exotic.
[19:47.99]Yeah, might as well.
[19:48.91]Alright, I got a full... I got everything's full.
[19:53.83]How much money do I have?
[19:55.31]5,700?
[19:55.33]We're going to Quake.
[19:59.71]Back to Quake.
[20:04.99]That'll just wake you up to make sure you're paying attention.
[20:08.37]Okay, who's in the lead right now?
[20:10.57]Trading Corp.
[20:17.13]Alright.
[20:18.81]So now what does the supply look like?
[20:22.89]Good thing we bought those Cryptoons.
[20:30.20]Nice.
[20:31.84]How is X fields and exotic here?
[20:37.00]Am I going to make money on this?
[20:42.70]I could fly to Hork, but that's a long trip.
[20:54.74]Did somebody say this is the kind of game that you vape to?
[21:00.22]No, it's not.
[21:02.92]This is the kind of game that you walk in and your dad is playing.
[21:06.22]And you don't know even how this game is running on the computer that your dad is playing.
[21:12.99]This is a dad is using the computer game.
[21:17.43]And you never ask what this is.
[21:20.19]Because this is dad's space.
[21:23.15]And I don't really even fucking want to know what that is.
[21:25.47]I'm not even going to ask.
[21:33.20]This is one of those games which takes you back to the computer game times.
[21:36.96]Yeah.
[21:38.34]It's wonderful.
[21:40.46]Is dad part of Vape Nation?
[21:56.75]Dad does the sickest clouds.
[22:00.44]Okay.
[22:00.76]Alright.
[22:01.82]We're going to sell everything.
[22:04.22]It's time to sell everything.
[22:06.40]And then I'm going to see if I can pay.
[22:07.66]I got to pay my employees.
[22:08.70]44,000.
[22:12.12]Oh, and by the way, there is a full ashtray next to dad's desk.
[22:21.78]It's full of, it's, there's like at least eight or nine butts in there.
[22:28.27]That was a bad deal?
[22:29.45]It was?
[22:29.87]No, it wasn't.
[22:30.31]This shit was $460.
[22:34.09]This is $460.
[22:34.73]What are you talking about?
[22:40.12]Come in here and fucking tell me.
[22:44.64]Son, you can't come in here and tell me it was a bad deal.
[22:47.88]Go back and do your fucking homework, whatever it is you do.
[22:59.39]It said bad deal.
[23:03.36]Did it say bad?
[23:04.12]Alright.
[23:04.88]I got $52,000.
[23:07.44]I got to pay my fucking employees.
[23:09.92]Okay.
[23:14.74]I'm going to pay my taxes.
[23:17.05]Okay.
[23:21.25]Look at this place.
[23:22.87]This is Quaig.
[23:24.35]The history of Quaig.
[23:28.12]Am I not even going to read the lore in this one?
[23:31.63]No.
[23:32.23]Okay, I can't.
[23:32.83]What about the weather?
[23:33.59]Okay.
[23:34.09]It looks like the skies around Mira have cleared up.
[23:37.39]What about special?
[23:39.97]Uh-oh.
[23:55.34]Quaig is the infamous renegade planet.
[23:57.84]It is here that the galaxy's most notorious gangsters come to unload their wares.
[24:02.58]This week, Lady Cornucopia, the ruler of Quaig, offers to sell you 71 tons of babble seeds for only 62 kubars per ton.
[24:14.41]The current market price of babble seeds on Quaig is 69 kubars.
[24:20.64]So is that just like a little discount?
[24:24.53]Let's do it.
[24:24.97]What?
[24:25.79]What are you talking about?
[24:29.21]Did I just lose money?
[24:52.15]Hey, let's do a business transaction.
[24:54.17]Okay.
[24:54.89]Wait, sorry.
[24:55.41]I have a headache.
[24:56.27]Cancel the fucking entire merger.
[25:00.17]Cancel the whole acquisition.
[25:02.47]I have a headache today.
[25:03.78]It's like, okay, well, can you come?
[25:10.14]We can come in like in a couple days and do this.
[25:11.86]No, no, I'm sorry.
[25:12.86]I have a headache.
[25:14.60]Oh.
[25:14.72]We're buying.
[25:18.71]Okay.
[25:18.99]This is the Quake exchange.
[25:21.47]Where's Quake right now?
[25:22.41]Quake is doing alright.
[25:23.97]We're not going to buy any Quake.
[25:24.87]We need to buy... What color is... Okay, we need to go to Zine and buy the Zine stocks.
[25:35.85]Quake is a little too high right now.
[25:37.06]Let's see.
[25:39.52]Where's Zine?
[25:40.82]Yeah.
[25:41.62]Zine is $9.67.
[25:41.94]Okay.
[25:42.04]Okay.
[25:47.96]Alright, so now what are we doing now?
[25:50.70]I paid everybody.
[25:51.38]I got scammed, but it's okay.
[25:53.56]Alright, babble seeds.
[25:56.56]I was just going to buy babble seeds.
[25:59.38]What the hell?
[26:00.55]I'm just buying them.
[26:01.53]I'm buying babble seeds and polyester as much as I can afford.
[26:03.91]Okay, now where am I taking it?
[26:15.78]Polyester and Babel.
[26:17.20]Alright.
[26:17.58]Frack?
[26:19.30]We can sell them both in Frack.
[26:21.94]What about here?
[26:22.51]I got a full cargo.
[26:23.29]I can't take anything else.
[26:25.15]Let's go to Frack.
[26:27.97]This is a long way.
[26:28.69]Okay.
[26:36.84]Yeah.
[26:37.16]Every single company takes a turn on this.
[26:39.58]A week is one turn.
[26:43.27]Vandergriff arrives on frack.
[26:45.81]Vandergriff Limited lands on frack and buys all of the frog's legs in addition to some other items for a good price.
[26:51.65]Faster is better.
[26:54.47]Roke lands on frack before you and buys up a big stash of exotic at a bargain price.
[26:58.81]Okay.
[27:03.39]Home of Voyager's insurance.
[27:08.05]Okay, so let's see what we got for supply.
[27:11.75]Polyester is going to sell really well here.
[27:14.83]Check it out.
[27:17.87]Market price 370.
[27:18.89]That's almost a double.
[27:20.89]Sell it all.
[27:23.03]Nice.
[27:25.11]Babble seeds go for a lot here.
[27:27.74]Okay.
[27:28.34]I got 57,000.
[27:28.68]Okay.
[27:30.12]Insurance.
[27:40.00]Okay, here's how insurance works for those of you that are curious.
[27:45.52]I can spend $12,000 and what effectively happens is I guarantee that nothing bad will happen on my next trip.
[27:54.57]Random stuff happens.
[27:56.99]You can get invaded by a pirate or you can get attacked or you can lose stuff.
[28:01.67]Insurance is worth it, but not for $11,000.
[28:03.89]Not for that much.
[28:11.93]Okay, so what should I buy?
[28:13.65]Nothing really on this planet.
[28:19.39]X-Fuels?
[28:25.32]I could buy... I guess I could go X-Fuels to Hork.
[28:31.30]Alright, we're going X-Fuels and I'm going to buy a ton of it.
[28:35.44]Buy 20.
[28:36.94]All you have?
[28:37.48]This place doesn't have anything.
[28:41.21]Maybe should I advertise for the next planet?
[28:49.99]He loves money so much.
[28:57.00]This game feels like blowing off dust on a book.
[29:00.12]Yeah, a really nice old book that has so much knowledge.
[29:06.48]I think I just have to go to... Where am I here?
[29:10.93]I just gotta go to Hork.
[29:14.17]Yeah, we're gonna travel to Hork.
[29:15.89]It's a long way.
[29:17.01]No insurance.
[29:23.74]Due to a reassessment of your company's accident records, your Voyager's insurance premiums have been lowered by an average of 33%.
[29:30.04]Puffer Inc.
[29:35.10]Huffer ink runs into girdle.
[29:38.86]Okay.
[29:40.82]Why do I need to know that?
[29:43.66]He ran into this guy at a coffee shop.
[29:45.58]Why is that?
[29:46.40]Why do I care about this?
[29:48.26]I don't.
[29:53.10]Trading Corp has arrived on Hork.
[29:56.04]They beat you to Hork ahead of you and acquire a moderate amount of exotic before you can place an order.
[30:02.97]Wait a minute.
[30:04.29]Due to an unexpected rash of foreign dumping, the supply of raw materials on Hork temporarily soars.
[30:13.07]Prices plummet as oxygen, oogle sand, cryptunes, ex-fuels, gems, and exotic flood the market.
[30:19.65]Oh, that guy just got so fucked.
[30:28.47]Okay, what do we get?
[30:30.75]Oh, shit.
[30:33.30]Okay.
[30:35.58]Wait a minute.
[30:36.68]What's the supply like?
[30:41.07]What do I?
[30:41.35]Okay, I have X fuels.
[30:42.97]I'm going to sell the X fuels right now.
[30:44.53]This is going to be a lot of money.
[30:50.35]Wait, what?
[30:52.09]Wait, what just happened?
[30:55.52]How did I lose?
[30:56.02]Why did I lose money?
[30:57.08]Didn't it?
[30:59.16]How much money did I lose?
[31:00.62]Wait, what?
[31:03.57]Oh, fuck.
[31:04.75]I forgot.
[31:05.41]I thought X-Fuels wasn't part of it.
[31:06.55]I thought it was just Gems, Exotic, Oogle, Sands, and... Okay.
[31:08.99]Oops.
[31:12.55]Oops.
[31:13.97]I wasn't looking.
[31:15.80]I wasn't looking.
[31:17.56]I'll just buy them back.
[31:21.36]Yeah, what the fu... This is what I just looked at.
[31:23.92]This is like, hey, man, sell X-Fuels now, here.
[31:27.44]This is not even updated market information.
[31:31.21]This is telling me that they need them bad.
[31:33.77]I am here at the moment of the market happening.
[31:38.97]I'm here at the very moment.
[31:40.93]They haven't even updated this yet.
[31:42.54]I'm here so early.
[31:44.18]Well, whatever.
[31:44.66]Look, I'm here.
[31:45.62]Alright.
[31:48.66]Let's go to the marketplace.
[31:49.76]There's a ton of this shit.
[31:51.14]So who has the least supply of all this?
[31:55.78]Frack?
[31:59.74]Looks like it's frack.
[32:01.92]Frack needs polyester?
[32:03.14]I could just say who cares and buy the cantaloupes.
[32:09.09]I'll buy a bunch of the gems.
[32:10.57]And I'm going to store them too.
[32:12.09]Yeah, I'm going to buy a bunch of gems up that I can afford.
[32:17.30]Buy a hundred of these and then let me... Because you get a warehouse.
[32:27.60]Okay, so I'm storing 50 gems.
[32:30.96]Let me buy another 50 gems.
[32:33.84]Actually, no, no, no.
[32:34.57]Yeah, let me... I could go take this to Canto.
[32:40.27]Let me get some sand, too.
[32:44.11]Okay, I have 50 sand and 50 gems.
[32:51.33]Mira needs these... Actually, you know what?
[32:54.49]I think I'm just going to take sand.
[32:55.85]Oh, wait, no.
[32:58.45]Frack is at zero, too.
[33:01.78]Alright, we're taking the gems and we're taking the sand to frack.
[33:03.95]And we're going to make a ton of money.
[33:09.69]But you know what?
[33:11.87]I think I'm going to only carry sand.
[33:16.38]Yeah, I got to change what I did here.
[33:22.50]I'm not losing anything.
[33:23.44]That is the same price.
[33:25.14]I want as much sand as I can carry.
[33:29.70]Because you can only store 50 things.
[33:31.60]Alright, so now we've got to go to frack.
[33:32.74]Because this is 0%.
[33:34.22]That's crazy.
[33:34.94]Alright.
[33:38.29]Should I buy insurance?
[33:39.07]What if I get, like, attacked?
[33:41.11]Wait, so my insurance went down, right?
[33:44.55]That's so much money, though.
[33:45.65]But I think I need to guarantee that I'm going to sell a lot.
[33:52.93]I'm doing it.
[33:56.49]I can't afford to have something bad happen right now.
[34:00.03]Alright, let's go to Frack.
[34:04.11]It's a pretty long way, that's why I did it.
[34:12.10]Due to your good credit record and sound business practices, the Traders Union lowers your loan rate from 5% to 4%.
[34:18.13]Ooh!
[34:21.47]Trading Corp attempts a more cautious, conservative approach to business.
[34:27.21]Yeah, you're going to fucking fail.
[34:31.84]Huffer Inc.
[34:32.32]is the one that's doing the best right now.
[34:34.24]Elite grind set.
[34:35.18]We're doing the worst.
[34:38.98]Huffmeister beats you to frack for you and buys up all the frog's legs.
[34:42.57]I don't care about that.
[34:43.73]That's not what I'm doing here.
[34:47.07]Oh, shit.
[34:47.77]That's not good.
[34:50.69]Oh, I can pick up passengers, too.
[34:52.29]Wait, ticket price.
[34:53.11]Where are they going?
[34:54.91]Let's make it $5,000.
[34:58.36]I can take six people.
[35:00.50]There's somebody waiting.
[35:01.42]Will they pay 5,000 to go somewhere?
[35:04.56]Holy shit.
[35:05.04]You just paid me five grand for nothing.
[35:07.80]Okay.
[35:08.46]Remind me to do that every time.
[35:11.44]Alright.
[35:11.70]This is where this, come on, come on.
[35:15.97]Oh man.
[35:16.43]This is going to be a lot.
[35:17.39]Okay.
[35:20.57]Gems went, ah, in one week that went up a little.
[35:24.99]Should we just keep going until we find zero?
[35:35.87]Should I hold it and just keep driving?
[35:39.21]But all my insurance.
[35:43.37]How close is Mira and Hork from here?
[35:46.22]Okay, Mira's not far.
[35:51.60]I'm going for it.
[36:01.49]Okay.
[36:02.49]Broke transport falls into a trap set by the Darlene smugglers.
[36:06.69]Oh, thank God you were ahead of me.
[36:09.83]Money, money, money.
[36:11.30]Because politicians love to increase taxes, the imperial government raises the import tariff rate from 3% to 4%.
[36:17.30]What the fuck are you talking about?
[36:24.82]Alright, I gotta make a sale here.
[36:30.34]Look at that.
[36:31.08]This is the most amount of money I'm possibly going to make.
[36:33.02]And I have a hundred of them.
[36:34.36]I have a hundred tons of ogle sand.
[36:40.36]Sell all of it.
[36:42.44]Okay.
[36:43.12]That's how you make a, that's how you make a deal.
[36:46.60]76,000 in cash now.
[36:49.29]Are you high?
[36:49.91]You should be.
[36:51.01]No.
[36:55.17]Okay.
[36:55.75]I think I got to pay.
[36:56.89]Okay.
[36:57.71]Pay employees 13,000.
[37:03.02]I don't... I owe... How do I already owe $5,000 in taxes already?
[37:07.40]Okay.
[37:09.95]I'm gonna pay this loan down, because I... This is a $20,000, $25,000 loan.
[37:13.09]It's already at $33,000?
[37:13.83]You fucking scumbag.
[37:14.47]Pay that down a little.
[37:15.19]Okay, I got $50,000.
[37:15.59]Let's actually pay it down even more.
[37:16.79]Let's do another $10,000 on it.
[37:20.15]Okay.
[37:32.88]Okay.
[37:34.83]We're doing alright.
[37:35.43]Do you remember, just don't pay taxes.
[37:43.65]I don't know what happens if you don't pay.
[37:45.32]Okay.
[37:45.54]What happens if you don't?
[37:46.50]There's a passenger tax and a commodities tariff.
[37:53.34]Passenger tax is a 15% tax on all income from passengers, right?
[37:57.99]Okay.
[38:02.90]So I have to pay it, though.
[38:04.68]What if I just don't?
[38:06.92]I'd probably get in trouble.
[38:07.72]I'm not doing that.
[38:10.04]Let's explore this planet.
[38:13.12]The Grand Sage.
[38:14.74]Mira is the oldest and most mystical of all the planets of Cucubia.
[38:18.88]The majority of Cucubia's religions have their origin on Mira.
[38:25.37]While on Mira, you may pay a visit to the renowned Grand Sages and ask them for a blessing, which can help to turn a bad luck streak into good fortune.
[38:34.73]Okay, let's do it.
[38:37.41]The Grand Sages grant you a small blessing but warn you to keep to the path you know in your heart to be true.
[38:46.70]What does that mean?
[38:47.46]That's so open-ended.
[38:53.35]What if my path is... I don't know.
[39:00.59]It means pay your taxes.
[39:02.85]I did.
[39:03.59]I just paid my taxes and I have a blessing.
[39:05.31]OK, we're good.
[39:09.23]I've seen profits in long term.
[39:10.47]Analysts are predicting the mirror exchange is about to take off on a gradual upward trend.
[39:14.85]Really?
[39:20.77]Wait a minute.
[39:24.67]Where's mirror?
[39:26.60]Mirror is on fire right now.
[39:29.02]They think it's going to go up.
[39:31.42]Should I buy it?
[39:32.00]This is... I'm buying at the top.
[39:33.96]If I do this.
[39:39.60]If I buy five shares, how much is that?
[39:49.33]Okay.
[39:51.25]Okay, I have five shares and I bought it at the top.
[39:58.17]So I have about 10 grand in the Mira stock exchange.
[40:02.59]But it did say, it did say, where is it?
[40:06.21]It said that this is going to go up.
[40:07.77]The news, on the news, it said it was going to go up.
[40:09.73]It said that Mira is on a fucking crazy tear.
[40:13.13]Alright, remind me to come back to Mira.
[40:22.10]We're going to buy a shitload of umbrellas and bring them to Hork.
[40:30.72]Okay.
[40:31.04]What else do I want to bring to Hork?
[40:35.48]X fuels.
[40:36.22]Oh yeah.
[40:36.72]Look at this.
[40:37.08]I'm going to make even more money here.
[40:40.80]Alright.
[40:42.15]I'm maxed out.
[40:42.73]What about a passenger?
[40:43.65]It's five grand.
[40:44.37]I already have passenger.
[40:48.25]Okay.
[40:50.20]Okay.
[40:51.12]We're going to Hork.
[40:52.86]No insurance.
[40:53.46]Everything's paid up.
[40:54.36]Paid my loan down.
[40:55.30]Uh-oh.
[40:57.88]The Traders Union is auctioning off a 200-ton ship upgrade to the highest bidder.
[41:03.31]We're currently at 100.
[41:04.09]That's a big deal.
[41:06.47]The company that purchases this upgrade will be able to trade in their old ship for a new, larger one.
[41:11.45]You must now input your secret bid.
[41:14.97]You'll be notified of the auction results at the beginning of your next turn.
[41:19.39]Okay.
[41:19.63]I've got 16 or another four, 200 tons.
[41:23.55]This would be a huge deal.
[41:29.08]Okay.
[41:31.26]Let's do 10,000.
[41:31.86]I have 16 in cash, 14 on loan, and I got a hundred thousand credit limit all in.
[41:43.77]I'm not doing 50 grand.
[41:51.56]You should do 23K.
[41:53.22]I'll do 25K.
[41:54.42]No, but that's all my money and I'm gonna be back in debt.
[42:01.22]10,001.
[42:01.32]Actually, I like that.
[42:02.01]We'll do that.
[42:02.87]Alright, 10,001.
[42:10.97]Due to the reassessment of your company's accident records, your insurance premiums have been raised 50%.
[42:16.30]I didn't, what accident?
[42:23.36]Hires a mechanic to turbocharge the engine of the ship.
[42:28.22]Broke transport buys... I thought this was a shitload of poor quality goods.
[42:32.80]Like, why?
[42:36.22]Why are you doing that?
[42:37.14]$25,090?
[42:41.73]The next highest bid was gizzy shipping at $14,300.
[42:44.63]$25,000.
[42:44.65]Come on, man.
[42:53.44]Got all the lava lamps.
[42:54.70]Money, money, money.
[42:58.27]Passenger tax rate went up to 16%.
[42:59.81]Oh, we're coming back.
[43:05.57]That blue line is us.
[43:11.28]X fields and umbrellas isn't going to make us a lot of money.
[43:13.82]Check this out.
[43:16.14]Great deal.
[43:17.40]Yep.
[43:19.60]Great deal.
[43:20.26]Alright, we're back at 70k.
[43:24.18]There are gems in this warehouse.
[43:27.86]What are gems going for right now?
[43:34.08]Do they want gems at all?
[43:38.32]Who wants gems?
[43:43.79]Frack needs gems, but not really.
[43:51.33]Moon ferns.
[43:54.35]Hmm, there's not a whole lot here after that.
[44:08.45]Your agent.
[44:10.27]Orc is the media capital of Cucubia, affectionately known as Orkywood.
[44:16.15]You have an agent whose job is to get your company publicity for free.
[44:20.83]This week, your agent claims to have a mega media event scheduled for you on Planet Line News.

[69:33.34]It's an $80 market price.
[69:41.10]Any passengers?
[69:41.96]Okay, what if my ticket price, I make it $3,000 instead?
[69:48.84]Pay your loan off?
[69:52.77]Should I just pay the whole thing off?
[69:58.79]Okay.
[69:59.11]I just paid off my loan.
[70:01.21]I have $21,000.
[70:02.14]I don't have a personal loan anymore.
[70:04.66]Oh shit.
[70:05.18]Wait a minute.
[70:07.06]You get 1% interest per week.
[70:08.58]Anything that's in the bank.
[70:12.34]Okay.
[70:21.38]Shit.
[70:23.50]Your crew seems mildly annoyed over the fact that you haven't paid them.
[70:28.08]Can I pay?
[70:28.72]Okay.
[70:35.18]Okay, I think they can wait till next week.
[70:44.17]Oxygen.
[70:44.59]We're going to buy oxygen and exotics.
[70:49.43]Oxygen, cantaloupe, and exotics.
[70:59.41]They're expensive.
[71:02.17]180.
[71:06.36]I can't even afford buying all these.
[71:15.44]Okay, where are we going?
[71:16.24]Uh, we need to take the cantaloupe to Stai, the frog's legs to Stai, and the oxygen to Loro.
[71:23.05]We're gonna stop at Loro.
[71:35.97]Trading court suffers as profits fall due to a serious miscalculation in the commodities market.
[71:43.61]Oh fuck you.
[71:44.52]I don't have any more money.
[71:50.94]Oh shit.
[71:52.50]I need money from the bank.
[71:57.15]Okay.
[72:01.17]You need to buy cantaloupe.
[72:02.17]I 100%ed this game.
[72:04.67]Passenger pickup.
[72:05.93]That's 3,000.
[72:06.16]Um.
[72:06.40]Hold on.
[72:20.48]Where are we?
[72:21.38]Okay.
[72:22.40]Oxygen.
[72:22.80]That's some of the most profit I think I've made the whole game.
[72:32.21]Alright, we have to do this.
[72:37.75]Okay.
[72:39.89]I am now in a better spot.
[72:41.45]I need... How much is this?
[72:43.87]This is $12,000 every time I fly somewhere.
[72:46.85]This is so bad.
[72:48.93]I'm in so much trouble.
[72:49.99]I have to pay this down.
[72:54.14]I have to pay this down right now.
[72:57.42]Okay, I'm going to buy a bunch of frog's legs and cantaloupes and we're going to Stye.
[73:06.58]Frog's legs.
[73:09.32]Buy all the cantaloupes I can afford.
[73:11.68]And we gotta go to Stai.
[73:15.21]Cantaloupes actually are not gonna do very much.
[73:20.13]The highest they can be is 40 bucks.
[73:29.85]Alright, we gotta avoid cantaloupes.
[73:34.43]And when I go to Stye, we need a- we need like a- we need an absolute Hail Mary.
[73:46.96]Home for- wow, you happen to cross Spike the Space Mutt.
[73:50.95]Spike hops on board your ship and makes himself at home.
[73:53.27]You have a choice.
[73:54.69]Either you can adopt this stray dog or you can leave him on his asteroid.
[73:58.69]Do you adopt Spike?
[74:03.64]He's going to eat a bunch of cantaloupes.
[74:06.06]This is going to be a disaster.
[74:08.00]He's going to eat all the cantaloupes, but yes.
[74:12.43]Nightmare.
[74:13.49]Do you see what happens?
[74:14.73]This is called nightmare.
[74:18.05]Spike the space mutt turns out to be a real pain in the neck.
[74:20.73]I knew this was gonna happen.
[74:22.40]He runs wild on your ship, harassing your passengers, chewing holes in your new seats, tearing apart your wiring, and relieving himself on your bed.
[74:31.92]You finally end up dumping Spike on a passing asteroid, but not before he inflicts $11,000 worth of damage on your ship.
[74:46.34]It's not his fault.
[74:47.18]He's just a little guy.
[74:48.34]They keep lowering the tax rate.
[74:54.03]I think I'm in trouble.
[74:56.71]I'm in trouble.
[74:57.79]Minus $250,000.
[74:58.95]Uh-oh.
[75:01.45]Uh-oh.
[75:07.75]Okay.
[75:08.70]Well, we can sell the frog's legs and the cantaloupe.
[75:10.94]Okay, we need an actual plan here.
[75:18.81]I have 20k in cash.
[75:23.02]I can buy a bunch of- do I have anything in the warehouse here?
[75:25.64]No.
[75:26.98]Alright, give me something crazy.
[75:29.88]Whoa, this place is cool.
[75:36.41]Stai is the financial capital of Kukubia and where the Traders Union headquarters is located.
[75:42.49]While on STI, you can ask the Traders Union for financial assistance.
[75:46.99]If you are lucky, they may lower the interest rate on your loan, increase your credit limit, or raise the interest rate on your savings account.
[75:54.10]Ooh, okay.
[75:56.28]Ask for assistance.
[76:00.14]They urge you to improve your business practice rather than relying on them to bail you out.
[76:10.65]I'm only $273,000 in the red.
[76:17.39]Shit.
[76:20.79]They just said get good, and they did, yeah.
[76:23.77]Okay.
[76:25.45]We got to make a massive profit here.
[76:29.51]Ogle Sands.
[76:32.97]Umbrellas.
[76:35.35]How much Ogle Sands are here?
[76:37.27]A lot.
[76:39.57]Okay.
[76:40.79]We can make a bunch of money off that.
[76:42.73]And then umbrellas.
[76:46.77]Can I afford to buy these?
[76:48.50]Okay.
[76:51.28]Alright.
[76:51.76]Alright, alright, alright.
[76:52.74]We're good.
[76:53.10]We just gotta take these to Hork.
[76:57.94]And hope it stays low.
[77:00.74]Does Hork still have like a bunch of crime or something?
[77:03.72]I remember it was like in the area.
[77:04.86]There's pirates or there's bandits.
[77:14.47]We gotta go for it.
[77:15.41]Check the news.
[77:19.89]The Horc exchange shot up this week.
[77:21.57]The average share price gained an amazing 396 points.
[77:25.59]A number of big investors, including Mr. Zin, made a tidy profit.
[77:31.99]Alright.
[77:32.97]Do I have any shares there?
[77:37.85]I can't.
[77:38.61]I cannot do a secret up now.
[77:40.77]How about fucking $1?
[77:45.38]I can't afford another two.
[77:46.50]No, I cannot.
[77:50.16]Again, Puffer Inc.
[77:52.20]suffers major damage when a giant lipo junkie slams into a ship.
[77:57.96]And he made even more money!
[77:59.14]Can I get hit by an asteroid?
[78:00.48]They keep dropping the tax rate over and over again.
[78:10.17]Dude, all that it takes to be successful in this universe is get hit by, is just get hit by a fucking bus twice.
[78:18.31]You gotta be kidding me.
[78:20.67]It's ridiculous.
[78:23.07]Alright.
[78:23.97]Um, how are we doing?
[78:26.17]Okay, good.
[78:27.13]I'll still make some money off both of these.
[78:28.53]Great deal.
[78:34.17]That just may have saved the entire run.
[78:37.08]That just saved the whole run.
[78:39.78]I have to pay this down.
[78:41.68]At $300,000, I think if you go over this, you have probably only a week or two to bring it down.
[78:48.48]Okay.
[78:54.99]$300,000.
[78:55.03]Okay.
[78:56.17]I brought it down.
[78:56.81]I got money.
[78:58.81]Pay the crew.
[78:59.47]Pay my taxes.
[79:04.47]We survive another week.
[79:08.82]There are... There are... Whoa.
[79:23.55]Holy shit.
[79:24.81]$654 market price.
[79:25.53]Are you fucking kidding me?
[79:30.92]Okay.
[79:32.70]I think we're doing fine.
[79:38.23]Take a personal loan out at a lower interest rate to pay the higher interest rate loan of Zin's loan.
[79:44.05]This is 4% per week.
[79:44.69]This is 5% per week.
[79:45.31]Interesting.
[79:46.49]So if I take out... If I take out $175,000... Wait, is this going to work?
[79:49.66]If I take out $175,000...
[80:09.01]And I pay the other one down.
[80:10.21]Okay, so I have $275,000 loan.
[80:13.33]I have $226,000.
[80:13.61]I'm going to pay back $200,000 on this loan.
[80:14.93]You're going to pay double interest.
[80:16.31]Should I just pay the whole thing?
[80:46.14]Dude, this is how the 2008 financial crisis happened.
[80:52.12]Take out a loan to pay the other loan.
[80:54.71]Just keep taking out loans to pay the last one back.
[81:01.37]Okay, I think this is an absolutely stupid idea.
[81:05.96]And I need to pee.
[81:07.52]So we're going to take a quick break.
[81:08.88]I'll be right back.
[81:11.20]I think we're okay though.
[81:12.22]I don't hate this idea.
[81:14.99]Did we get it twisted?
[81:16.42]Did we get it wrong?
[81:17.30]I don't think it's wrong yet.
[81:19.36]I think we're alright.
[81:20.30]I'll be right back.
[92:49.01]Okay.
[92:49.47]I'm back.
[92:49.79]I had to get, I had to get a drink and then my microphone stand was being weird.
[92:58.32]So I had to move that.
[92:59.30]We're back.
[93:03.74]Sorry.
[93:17.42]Just do a big fake yawn.
[93:21.18]How does it make you all feel?
[93:26.30]You took a 20 minute nap.
[93:27.52]Yeah, I just took a quick nap.
[93:28.44]I'm good.
[93:35.38]Do I have the right headphone here?
[93:41.60]Dude, I want it like in bright orange letters.
[93:48.99]Which headphone is what side?
[93:50.25]Have you noticed that sometimes you have to look at it under like a bright light with a microscope on it?
[93:57.34]It's like, I don't care if it shows up and it's bright as it's crazy bright.
[94:01.30]I just want to see what it's always like so hard to see.
[94:03.94]Okay.
[94:14.22]Alright.
[94:16.61]So true.
[94:18.51]It's the first time watching your stream live?
[94:23.43]Oh, well, what's up?
[94:26.21]Let's see, like, in another six weeks.
[94:32.04]Alright, it's time.
[94:32.90]I have a 5% loan, and then I have a 4% loan.
[94:41.43]It's going to get weird.
[94:42.41]So...
[94:46.21]two hundred and six okay so I'm just gonna pay this whole loan back pay the whole thing back I'll still have about 50 grand it's a done deal I now don't have any money at all wait what didn't I have 250. wait a second wait I think it is soft lock the game I thought I had 200 I thought I had 250.

[95:20.05]I think I actually fucked up everything.
[95:22.99]I thought I... Okay, I just read it wrong.
[95:26.23]Wait a minute!
[95:29.39]Where are my shares?
[95:30.11]I have shares on a... Wait, hold on.

[96:04.88]What planet do I own stock in again?
[96:07.10]I don't know.

[96:40.98]Actually, it's $7,000?
[96:41.72]Hold on.
[96:53.34]Ooh, this is actually a big deal.
[96:55.96]They increased my credit limit.
[97:01.16]Snaws Lombardo, a less than acclaimed lounge singer, stops your ship.
[97:08.50]He says that he has just landed a contract at a hot lounge on Zine.
[97:13.71]He's willing to pay you 40,000 coup bars if you take him there right away.

[97:33.19]Okay.
[97:33.49]If this is a scam, I lose everything and I lose the game.
[97:38.74]If it's not a scam, we're back.

[100:37.55]We have effectively dropped our interest payments.
[100:43.43]Let's, uh, let's go.

[102:06.20]I bought at the top.
[102:10.20]Need to wait for the dip.
[102:12.08]I think I, no, I cash out here.
[102:16.30]This thing is going to go like that.
[102:21.22]Yeah, I mean, if we're talking about Fibonacci levels.
[102:28.04]I think this is going to come down to a Fibonacci retracement.
[102:42.01]You couldn't even spell Fibonacci?
[102:43.31]Yes, I could.
[102:45.73]I absolutely could.
[102:46.55]It's because you're dope and can't do it doesn't mean I'm not.

[103:23.20]No, bro.
[103:30.96]Why can't something like this happen to me?
[103:33.26]Gizzy Shipping inherits quite a bit of money.
[103:36.40]Inherited from who?
[103:37.14]His grandma?
[103:38.36]What are you talking about?
[103:39.20]Okay, fuel prices are low.

[104:51.41]75 tons of gems for 153 and the current price is 170.

[105:18.83]Hold on a second.
[105:22.47]We're bringing these gems over to Zine.
[105:25.83]And I'm going to buy more of them.
[105:28.77]And I'm going to fuck up my whole business.
[105:37.54]I'm going to fuck my whole business up.
[105:39.58]But we've got to go for it.

[105:43.52]Nothing bad, nothing bad, nothing bad, nothing bad, nothing bad, nothing bad, nothing bad, nothing bad.
[105:54.90]Your ship encounters Hans, a well-known crook and racketeer.
[105:59.76]Hans offers to exchange the cargo you have on your ship for 150 tons of exotic.
[106:05.70]Under imperial law, you are forbidden to buy, sell, or trade any goods you know are stolen.
[106:11.25]You break the law and accept.
[106:13.93]What do I have?
[106:14.77]I have 150 gems for 150 exotic.
[106:18.09]Exotic is worth a lot.
[106:19.90]A lot, a lot, a lot.
[106:20.88]Like 100k a lot, potentially.
[106:28.12]You break the law and accept it.
[106:34.90]Not worth it?
[106:38.04]You should just do a save, scum.
[106:39.48]Okay, no.
[106:43.15]What is this guy doing?
[106:46.29]What is this guy doing?
[106:48.49]What is this guy doing?
[106:51.77]What is happening with this guy?
[106:53.61]Something very strange is going on.
[106:58.21]Uh... Well, what do you want from me?
[107:03.07]Okay.
[107:06.27]Sleg, an intergalactic commodities broker, asks you if you will trade your five-quarp engine for his two-quarp engine.
[107:15.78]Okay, you fucking, like, ball sniffer.

[107:29.38]$150,000 and my ship sucks now?
[107:34.72]Hold on.
[107:35.04]This could be... I don't know.
[107:37.23]I don't know.
[107:39.89]He wants my better ship and he's willing to give me $150,000 for it.
[107:45.93]That's what's happening.
[107:47.05]And he gives me his bad, his shitty one.
[107:50.11]I need liquid capital right now.
[107:57.23]I need cash.
[108:03.12]Don't do it.
[108:03.72]Fuck this guy.
[108:09.32]This wipes out almost all the debt.
[108:13.73]Yeah, but do you really want to deal with somebody like this?
[108:16.33]Who's like sniffing his... Whatever that is.
[108:22.99]Okay, the person that did the art for this, you know, you draw this character and you're like, you know, how about, you know, how about like an appendage coming out from down here that goes right into his nose?
[108:35.65]Like, they could have been like here, right?
[108:37.93]This could have come out and stopped here.
[108:40.21]This was an artistic direction to have it go up into his nose.
[108:47.10]Would it be worse if it was out here?
[108:52.24]I think I'm gonna do it.
[108:54.06]I have to accept it.
[108:55.02]I have to accept this, like, weirdo's fucking proposal.
[108:59.70]I'm doing it.

[109:35.18]The teal tree is so thankful that you are taking her to Frack to be reunited with her grove that she offers to pay you 17,000 kubars for your trouble.
[109:42.96]She insists that you are the kindest person in the galaxy.
[109:45.85]She knows the money isn't enough, but it's all she has, and she hopes it will do.
[109:49.47]Oh, hey, just in case anybody was curious, the little puffer guy got hit by another fucking bus.

[110:32.33]As you see.
[110:34.54]Sometimes the lion needs a few moments, a little bit of time before he's ready to pounce.
[110:46.14]That's us.
[110:48.69]I have a terrible ship, but I have $167,000 now.

[112:27.60]Pay the loan down even more.
[112:29.08]I'll, you know, I'll do another 20 K.
[112:32.28]We'll do 25 K after that sale.

[113:01.64]I want to go to Mira.
[113:02.24]We're going to do moon ferns, and we're going to go to Mira, because I want to cash out those shares.
[113:10.71]Alright, we're flying to Mira.
[113:11.55]Insurance rate went up by 23%.
[113:17.51]We don't even buy insurance, it appears.
[113:26.78]Vandergriff is bogged down in a patch of mippy weeds.
[113:32.52]Puffer is now turbocharged.
[113:38.23]Hey, we went from the worst in the galaxy to mid.
[113:43.71]Okay, taxes went up a little.
[113:48.27]Oh, we're climbing now.

[114:01.87]Look at this.
[114:04.71]Okay.
[114:05.09]If I sell all my shares, that's 10,000.
[114:09.26]Wait, what?
[114:13.94]Oh, okay.
[114:14.32]That's good.
[114:15.98]Sell.

[114:28.28]I got $135,000.
[114:28.68]This is coming down.
[114:31.37]There's no way this is going up higher.
[114:34.19]He sold.
[114:34.83]Pump it.
[114:37.97]I'll take my little gain there, I guess.

[114:48.04]Okay, $140,000.
[114:49.04]Okay.
[114:55.73]Another 50K on that loan.
[115:01.30]I'm going to stay on top of this because I don't want to have to worry about that.
[115:04.72]Look at that insurance premium.
[115:05.86]Oh my goodness.
[115:07.30]I do need to buy a little bit of fuel as much as I don't want to.
[115:10.48]I have to. 20,000.
[115:19.99]Okay.
[115:20.97]Umbrellas are good.
[115:23.31]Umbrellas and frog's legs?
[115:25.87]Well, frog legs and babble seeds and then go to frack.
[115:28.85]Yeah.
[115:31.24]That's what I'm doing.
[115:35.06]Okay.
[115:39.70]What else is needed on frack?
[115:45.21]Gems and cantaloupe.
[115:47.85]We can do gems.
[115:50.23]Because there's a lot of this big supply here and I have the money to buy as much of these as I can.
[115:55.11]Okay.
[115:56.41]On to Frack.
[115:58.79]Wait.
[115:59.59]Not quite.
[116:03.70]Okay.
[116:04.20]Space Pirates.
[116:06.18]They're around Zine.
[116:07.08]We're not going there.
[116:07.88]Should I get a Blessing?
[116:14.70]The Grand Sage bless you and your crew and urge you to give as much to others as you expect for yourself.
[116:20.43]Okay.
[116:23.05]Good, good.
[116:23.51]Let's go to Frack.
[116:28.53]Please lower your passenger prices.
[116:29.99]Damn it.
[116:38.04]Your ship needs a bigger engine.
[116:41.24]Fuel prices are on the rise.
[116:42.50]I'm glad I bought it when I did.
[116:46.15]This person is popping off so bad.
[116:49.41]Where am I?
[116:51.07]Elite grind set.
[116:52.39]Right there.
[116:53.89]Haven't lost a damn thing.
[116:55.61]Haven't gained a damn thing.
[117:06.57]Okay.
[117:10.35]These are going to all sell for a lot.
[117:14.28]Frog legs.
[117:14.96]I'm going to hold the gems because Hork is... I might buy some more gems here, honestly, and just say who cares.
[117:24.61]Sell the... Yeah, I'll sell these.
[117:32.60]Okay, 64.
[117:36.04]No, I'm not buying any of these.
[117:37.08]This is way too much.
[117:37.76]Well, actually... No, I'll hold it.
[117:43.00]Alright, we're going to go to Hork and we're going to buy up a ton of their Babel season and come back.
[117:46.69]Another secret bid for a 200 ton ship upgrade.
[118:01.01]I feel like I need this.
[118:08.38]No, you need an engine, not storage.
[118:11.06]That's true.
[118:14.40]Did I just do 100k?
[118:15.06]Because I clicked the X. Ooh.
[118:19.68]You come across Teeter.
[118:21.46]A traveling repairman.
[118:22.80]Teeter says that he has the necessary parts to turbocharge your engine for 14 grand.
[118:26.79]Yep.
[118:29.35]Teeter is brilliant.
[118:30.27]In no time, he manages to turbocharge your engine.
[118:33.09]Nice.
[118:33.51]Good.
[118:33.69]Uh-oh.
[118:37.73]Vandergriff LTD is accused of illegally trading stock in opposition to Imperial regulations.
[118:43.82]So what happens?
[118:46.00]A fine or something?
[118:46.86]I could have bought it for a hundred.
[119:01.96]I'm okay with this.
[119:03.28]We're doing alright.
[119:04.12]I'm almost in profit.
[119:09.46]Gems on Hork.
[119:12.16]Okay.
[119:13.20]Sell the gems here.
[119:14.00]That'll make me a lot of money.
[119:18.33]Good.
[119:21.51]Buy all the oxygen.
[119:22.61]All the jelly beans and all the cantaloupes.
[119:35.75]Okay.
[119:37.56]And then we're going to Loro for the oxygen.
[119:41.90]Yeah, let's make it quick.
[119:50.30]Why do I want to play this shit?
[119:52.14]Um, because it's fun.
[119:57.50]Puffer Inc.
[119:58.00]runs smack into a band of rowdy mooglers.
[120:00.68]The bad things keep happening, but it doesn't matter.
[120:03.48]Okay.
[120:09.14]We're going to take out Gizzy's shipping.
[120:10.46]This is not going well.
[120:15.61]I just upgraded my ship.
[120:20.59]This turns out to be a really good idea.
[120:24.05]Every single time somebody comes here, you get five grand.
[120:26.39]Okay, oxygen.
[120:35.74]Oof, that's going to be a lot.
[120:39.70]22,000.
[120:39.82]I could double.
[120:44.28]Yeah, I get double my money.
[120:47.54]Okay.
[120:47.86]103,000.
[120:47.94]Let's pay the crew.
[120:53.58]Good.
[120:55.34]Okay.
[120:56.22]I'm going to deposit.
[120:57.54]Let's say 30,000 into the bank because I want the interest.
[121:05.65]What about the loan?
[121:07.59]I'll pay the loan down by $10,000.
[121:10.33]That's $300 a week.
[121:18.99]Grow up.
[121:20.87]Pay the whole loan right now.
[121:22.23]You don't want to be cash broke.
[121:24.89]You don't want to be cash broke.
[121:26.29]I don't want to be cash broke.
[121:35.34]I need to buy fuel.
[121:36.18]Stop telling me to pay my debt.
[121:37.72]Look at this.
[121:38.20]I'm so... Oh my god.
[121:40.30]Okay.
[121:42.68]I had to pay it.
[121:46.64]Now I gotta take money out of the bank.
[121:50.24]I just walked in the door.
[121:51.62]Now I'm walking out.
[121:52.76]I need to be able to buy stuff.
[121:56.63]Okay.
[121:57.67]Babble seeds.
[121:59.69]And... X fuels.
[122:02.53]That sounds good to me.
[122:11.43]Okay.
[122:12.69]Who needs babble seeds the most?
[122:15.89]Brack.
[122:17.98]Got it.
[122:18.64]Okay.
[122:23.98]Elia Velia, Queen of Loro.
[122:26.20]Loro is known as the pleasure planet.
[122:28.18]Okay.
[122:28.48]Yeah.
[122:28.68]Okay.
[122:28.86]So we should let the crew leave, right?
[122:34.71]Good.
[122:37.32]They're very energized and nothing bad happened.
[122:39.32]And the crew is happy.
[122:41.06]Good.
[122:41.44]Crew is paid.
[122:44.68]We are moving our way to frack.
[123:00.29]Interest rate on bank account is now 2%.
[123:03.88]Oh, wait, it's this guy again.
[123:04.96]It's Schnauz.
[123:06.16]He's going to give you $60,000.
[123:07.16]We're doing it every time.
[123:11.53]He's willing to pay you $61,000 to take him there right now.
[123:13.95]Yes.
[123:17.19]Investing heavily in warehouses.
[123:21.92]I think he did it, right?
[123:22.92]It worked, right?
[123:25.14]Yep.
[123:26.89]$65,000.
[123:26.97]That random event is insane.
[123:32.43]We're paying the whole thing back.
[123:34.67]I don't have a loan now.
[123:35.98]We are cash.
[123:37.46]We are a cash business.
[123:39.58]Cash-operated business.
[123:41.02]No longer operating on debt.
[123:45.34]And we're going to get a blessing.
[123:46.14]Uh-oh.
[123:50.64]Give to others before asking for yourself.
[123:54.86]Uh...

[124:48.46]I bought it like here.
[124:51.26]We're doing alright.
[124:55.70]Should I buy more shares of Mira and let it ride?
[124:59.20]This game from 1994.
[125:05.04]Something like that.
[125:07.93]It's peaking.
[125:08.57]Yeah, it's definitely peaking.
[125:12.57]Alright.
[125:13.99]I need to sell.

[125:29.65]You need to buy fuel?
[125:30.55]Oh shit.
[125:32.37]What was that?

[125:38.50]Yo-Yo offers to make you a wager.
[125:41.26]He will flip a coin.
[125:42.08]If it comes up tails, he will pay you 4,800 kubars.

[125:46.80]Yes.
[125:46.96]Okay.
[125:56.23]Don't ever gamble with a pro.
[125:57.63]With both sides' heads.
[126:02.13]Hoffmeister falls victim to the evil wicky wicks.
[126:06.59]What does that mean?
[126:07.35]Okay.
[126:15.40]We're doing alright.
[126:20.80]Perfect.

[126:24.81]Oh, my bad.
[126:26.85]That's right.
[126:27.83]Let me make this like 3K.
[126:30.01]Oops.
[126:31.81]And we're going to advertise.
[126:32.97]I got advertising money now, don't I?

[126:44.48]No debt.
[126:46.00]Pay everybody off.
[126:49.69]OK, now let's let's make like an ad campaign.
[126:58.96]Buy umbrellas and we're going to do an ad.
[127:00.98]Okay, we're buying all the hair tonic and all the umbrellas and we're doing an ad campaign on Zine.
[127:10.46]All the hair tonic and all the... What was it?
[127:18.34]Umbrellas.
[127:18.96]That's what it was.
[127:23.23]Umbrella.
[127:24.85]There you go.
[127:27.45]Okay.
[127:28.09]What else should I buy to bring to Zine?
[127:32.37]No, not ex-fuels.
[127:34.35]Maybe a few polyester just to fill the ship out.
[127:40.83]Alright.
[127:41.33]Advertise.
[127:42.79]Commodities.
[127:46.75]Choose advertising and click on place ads to advertise for the next planet.
[127:51.50]How about in the newspaper?
[127:54.82]Okay.
[127:55.42]And now let's buy fuel.
[127:56.62]It's so expensive.
[128:00.61]Okay.
[128:02.69]Alright.
[128:04.87]I think we're good to move now.
[128:06.89]We're going to Zine.
[128:07.81]We have an ad campaign.
[128:08.85]Let's go.
[128:18.86]Bumps into Scooter J. Okay.
[128:21.30]Good.
[128:25.79]Your pilot sure is slow.
[128:27.89]I just turbocharged.
[128:30.69]Oh, that person's running away with everything.
[128:32.51]Okay, pick up passengers too.
[128:35.95]6,000.
[128:41.45]Umbrellas.
[128:41.87]Okay, we're going to sell everything.
[128:44.52]This looks good.
[128:45.22]75k.
[128:58.97]Okay, I need to buy more.
[129:00.61]I need to buy, like, a better ship.
[129:07.53]What is the supply here?
[129:08.82]Diapers.
[129:11.34]Diapers, Babble Seeds.
[129:15.48]And, okay, Diapers, Babble Seeds, Frog's Legs.
[129:18.23]We're gonna go Diapers and Bab- Diapers and Frog's Legs to Quaig.
[129:26.47]Oh shit, I got it.
[129:27.93]Okay, let's go to Quag.
[129:33.35]Mechanic?
[129:33.81]Okay.
[129:35.45]Expand your ship's cargo by 10 tons.
[129:37.26]No, I don't want to do that.
[129:44.66]Does he know what he's doing?
[129:47.38]I think I'm doing alright.
[129:50.76]The Hungo warriors have taken to the warpath near Hork.
[129:54.44]Okay.
[129:56.16]We're not going over there.
[130:04.82]Zine is... Let's buy some shares in Zine as well.
[130:10.88]These things are down here in the fucking toilet.
[130:17.48]Mir is still going.
[130:20.06]I'm having seller's remorse.
[130:21.40]I sold it right here.
[130:26.34]It could be worth millions.
[130:29.90]Okay, we're going to deposit.
[130:30.97]I actually didn't mean to do that.
[130:38.13]I want $30,000 to use.
[130:38.89]We'll have $40,000 in the bank.
[130:39.81]Pay everybody.
[130:40.25]I got $20,000.
[130:41.55]Okay.
[130:41.69]Diapers to Quag.
[130:42.53]Let's go.
[130:57.17]Alright, this is a big deal, actually.
[130:58.33]Big deal.
[131:02.33]Okay.
[131:03.31]That's low, though.
[131:04.45]The other ones have been 4,000 or 5,000.
[131:05.63]This is kind of low.
[131:10.51]We have to secretly bid for this.
[131:15.63]I got 40,000 in the bank.
[131:16.98]I got 60,000 ready.
[131:20.74]Do you think it's still worth it? 100,000?
[131:26.11]Is the most I'm willing to pay for this?
[131:27.17]Someone's going to do like 150.
[131:28.85]What about 120?
[131:35.73]I'm going to have to tap back into some credit, but this is 3k potentially every week.
[131:40.56]60 max.
[131:42.52]How about 75?
[131:44.72]I'll do 75,000.
[131:55.98]Oh, man.
[131:59.56]Kind of hope I don't win that auction now.
[132:04.64]This is an 800-ton ship, and it's 70,000.
[132:05.96]No, I can't.
[132:18.47]Moles, a reclusive retired business consultant, comes out of his shell to offer you a piece of free advice.
[132:24.57]Okay.
[132:25.95]Luck runs in streaks.
[132:28.61]If you're on a bad luck streak, make sure to buy insurance before traveling.
[132:32.75]Good advice, thank you.
[132:35.07]Bad management decisions.
[132:41.77]I knew it was going to be over 120k.
[132:51.02]Whoever bought this is just making so much money.
[132:53.04]It's ridiculous.
[132:57.10]My net worth is climbing.
[132:58.02]I don't remember.
[132:59.10]I don't have any debt.
[133:13.39]How are the diapers doing?
[133:17.40]Do I sell them here or do I bring them back to Frack?
[133:21.82]Oh, hold on.
[133:22.32]We're going to leave some diapers on the planet.
[133:36.51]And we're going to go to Frack with all of this hull.
[133:41.00]Wait.
[133:43.54]Wait.
[133:49.23]Liquid soap into the planet's water supply?
[133:51.09]The emperor feels this would save time in soap.
[133:54.62]The governor, however, wouldn't commit, fearing the water may not taste very good.
[134:02.20]That's not a bad price.
[134:02.98]I don't have enough money.
[134:05.53]Shit.
[134:11.17]I need to leave some money in the bank.
[134:12.35]Alright, we're going to frack.
[134:17.81]And we're going to make a shitload of money on Freq.
[134:19.67]Watch this.
[134:31.93]Trying to put me back into debt.
[134:33.25]This is a... What?
[134:40.08]Because your company is struggling to make a profit and your crew is afraid of losing their jobs, they reluctantly agree to forget about any money you owe them.
[134:48.75]That means you don't have to pay $12,000 in wages.
[134:53.88]Nice.
[134:55.72]Oh.
[134:58.58]Okay.
[135:02.87]I think I'm going to do it.
[135:06.89]Exotic is worth an unbelievable amount.
[135:15.58]Don't do it.
[135:16.42]He's a fed.
[135:18.30]How do you know that?
[135:23.50]Not trustworthy?
[135:24.50]No?
[135:26.00]It's stolen goods?
[135:26.98]I know, but I could sell it for a lot.
[135:29.56]I'm not going to tell anybody.
[135:32.20]Somebody already got... Sorry, somebody already got... Yeah.
[135:34.40]Fuck!
[135:49.34]oh my god oh my god why did I why was it did the guy take his mask off and it was a him the whole time what the hell I don't have that oh my god what

[136:26.67]And all of my cargo.
[136:29.51]Which if you remember.
[136:30.61]I was going to make a bunch of money on seeds and that just set me back.
[136:35.70]It was $50,000 took all of my.
[136:39.48]You took all of.
[136:41.38]You have to take everything I have.

[136:47.45]Oh, I have shares here on frac.
[136:50.45]Where's frac?
[137:04.59]We're doubling down.
[137:12.44]This is so bad.
[137:13.40]Nothing here is worth buying.
[137:22.56]All this stuff is too expensive.
[137:23.82]I have to travel to like Quag.
[137:25.52]Alright, I'm going to travel to Quag.
[137:28.94]Shit.

[137:47.20]Let's reset.
[137:48.04]I forgot the passengers.
[137:51.68]God damn it.
[137:55.80]Supreme Commander Dred Nicholson, Emperor of the New Realm, pays a visit to your company.
[138:01.30]He praises your hard work and loyal support of the New Realm.
[138:05.29]At the end of his speech, he asks you to make a small donation of 21,000 kubars to the Imperial Trust Fund.
[138:11.07]Do you donate the money?
[138:19.85]I just took out 50 grand.
[138:20.71]Are you going to take half of it right now?
[138:24.46]Money, money, money.
[138:28.94]Oh, isn't that something?
[138:32.08]Without any explanation, the government informs you that they're adding a special one-time fee of 21,000 kubars to your taxes.
[138:37.19]Money, money, money.
[138:40.41]The imperial government audits your company.
[138:42.49]You must pay 22,000 kubars in back taxes plus a fine of 45,000 kubars for not paying on time.
[138:48.29]You know what?
[138:51.97]what the hell that's all of my money what I should have donated I should have donated to the government is that what you're telling me I should have donated to the government they didn't say that was for charity that was dude hey can you donate to the government

[139:43.30]Um... Yep.
[139:47.16]Okay.
[139:48.52]Things are looking a little bit less worse than they just were.
[139:54.45]Babel seeds and moon ferns.
[139:59.30]Imagine if I had the exotic.
[140:02.86]The exotic is selling for 628.
[140:04.14]That would be 628 times 150.
[140:08.14]Come on.
[140:09.86]Really?
[140:10.24]It's ridiculous.

[151:48.90]I sold it here.
[151:50.94]That's so horrible to look at.

[152:55.43]You must pay $22,000 for a repair droid to come out and fix your ship.
[153:00.34]You don't have enough to cover the cost.
[153:02.34]So they loaned me the difference.
[153:05.62]It took you considerably longer to get there.
[153:09.36]Good thing Trading Corp 4 got an emergency tax break.
[153:17.93]Oh my god.
[153:22.06]Every single person got here before me.
[153:25.80]Every company on Earth.
[153:26.68]Am I even going to be able to... And I did an advertising campaign.
[153:33.82]I advertised that everybody should be ready to buy stuff on frack.
[153:38.12]And they used it instead of me.
[153:45.57]Shit.
[153:55.28]Jelly beans to Mira.
[154:00.13]Jelly beans to Mira.
[154:02.13]Jelly beans don't go for anything.
[154:04.63]Jelly beans, look, they don't sell for shit.
[154:14.20]We're finished.
[154:19.44]Bring gems.
[154:25.98]Yeah, but look, I would have to buy them from here.
[154:28.04]I guess I could go to Quay again.
[154:30.58]Okay, I'm going to go to Loro.
[154:32.68]And... Yeah, I'm going to go to Loro, buy gems, and bring them to Stai.
[154:41.46]This is bad.
[154:47.62]I know, where's the... Alright, you got to tell me.
[154:53.26]The RNG I'm getting here is kind of ridiculous.
[154:55.79]I have to pay... I keep losing money to this shit.
[155:02.98]And now I'm terrified to not do it.
[155:05.80]Because I got... I had to pay like $50,000 last time.
[155:09.32]And then there goes all my... I have $589.
[155:17.09]That's all I have.
[155:23.11]Good thing I can sell my jelly beans here for nothing.
[155:26.56]And all the money that I was just going to use, I can't buy that the whole point I came here.
[155:32.34]The reason why I came here was to... To buy gems.
[155:44.78]I'm in trouble.
[155:46.22]I think I actually might be in trouble.
[155:51.34]I owe $12,000 to the crew.
[155:59.50]What's even the supply here?
[156:00.47]We got jelly beans.
[156:01.87]Okay.
[156:04.79]Buy more jelly beans.
[156:06.81]I already bought them.
[156:09.11]And I'm taking the jelly beans back to Mira.
[156:12.74]And hopefully I get like a million dollars by getting hit by an asteroid.
[156:24.75]Oh, come on.
[156:33.01]You are unable to avoid the solar storm, and it thrashes your ship.
[156:38.59]Your expensive Eltech engine is nearly shredded, and you must pay $23,000 to have it repaired.
[156:45.43]You don't have enough to cover, but don't worry.
[156:48.02]The loan stepped in.
[156:56.00]uh oh uh oh that's not good I'm over my credit limit right now this is uh well I have
[157:15.05]Take a look at these.
[157:16.53]I've got 84 tons of jelly beans.
[157:20.31]Wow.
[157:20.85]$6,700.
[157:21.21]Not even going to cover the cost it took to fucking get here and the storm I went through.
[157:29.64]Oh, Grand Sage, I've been donating money to the government for the last seven months.
[157:34.40]Please grant me some type of anything that's worth anything at all.
[157:42.45]The Grand Sage is instructed to submit to reality instead of struggling to alter it.
[157:47.03]Well, you told me six months ago to donate all my money to the government.
[157:52.16]And I did.
[157:53.40]In various ways.
[157:54.90]Some of them may have been through the legal system where I had to pay exorbitant fees to the legal system for committing a few crimes.
[158:03.40]But it still happened nonetheless.
[158:05.80]This is GG.
[158:07.76]This is game over.
[158:08.84]This is a game over scenario.
[158:15.12]I don't have anything and I can't afford anything.
[158:21.40]I'm at my credit limit and I'm about to get thrown out of the, the traders union.
[158:25.60]Oh, well, well, it was a nice try.
[158:32.37]I'll try again.
[158:34.35]sell the ship I'll try it again I'll try again I'll try again wait let's set the ticket for let's okay well hold on here's where we can save this how about it's fifty thousand dollars for one ticket is anybody stupid enough to do this for a second I thought somebody did here's how bernie can still win
[159:05.37]It's the math.
[159:06.65]Here's the math.
[159:11.70]Well, we might as well just fly.
[159:13.52]I'm flying to Zine.
[159:15.58]If you leave the planet now, you'll go bankrupt and lose the game.
[159:18.24]You cannot owe more than 225,000 kubars to the Trader Union.
[159:22.41]Do you want to return to the main menu and try to straighten out your finances?
[159:28.93]Elite grind set bankrupt.
[159:31.92]Why are they burning?
[159:33.39]What are they doing?
[159:35.51]What happened?
[159:40.11]Big news on the financial front.
[159:42.34]Elite Grindset has gone bankrupt.
[159:45.14]Our sources inform us that all the assets are being liquidated to pay off creditors.
[159:49.72]We have reports of angry citizens taking to the streets demanding a full investigation, but there is little anyone can do.
[159:56.25]Elite Grindset is too deeply in debt to continue operating and no financial institution is willing to lend it any more money.
[160:03.08]The latest word from the Capitol is that Supreme Commander Dred Nicholson is terribly upset over the bankruptcy.
[160:08.92]The Supreme Commander addressed the Kukubian Senate this morning, saying that what happened to elite grindset is a big setback for the empire.
[160:17.24]At the end of the speech, Dred Nicholson promised to do his best to end this game before the Kukubian colonies suffer any further.
[160:26.79]I lose.
[160:29.17]Oh, man.
[160:36.35]I had like $200,000 in expenses that came up every week.
[160:41.78]It was 20,000, 40,000, 20,000.
[160:42.86]I took in a, I took in an $150,000 cash injection from the guy that gave me his busted up shitty ass ship.
[160:54.27]The thing burnt down after like 10 weeks.
[161:00.47]It was the illegal trading that got me.
[161:02.51]Yeah.
[161:04.84]It's too bad.
[161:07.31]I tried to get the guy with the exotic goods and he messed up everything for me.
[161:16.86]Damn it.
[161:17.12]Alright.
[161:18.64]I'm going to take another break.
[161:19.38]I'll be right back.
[161:20.27]We'll start over.
[161:20.81]We're going to learn from our mistakes.
[161:24.69]I'll be right back.
[161:26.45]Maybe like five minutes.
[164:31.08]Jeremy's reading all of the comments while pretending to be away.
[164:35.09]Yep.
[164:35.21]See you in a minute.
[164:37.77]See you in a few minutes.
[165:51.70]Okie dokie.
[165:58.56]I got a piece of chocolate.
[166:03.33]So here's the deal.
[166:08.09]We need to figure out a better system.
[166:12.83]This time I'm only going to buy expensive things.
[166:15.57]No loans this time.
[166:16.87]Round two.
[166:19.05]You eat a weed chocolate.
[166:21.52]No, I'm not really into that.
[166:32.65]Weed chocolate is like, I don't know.
[166:37.91]Like just an edible is fine.
[166:39.45]But when you put it in, like you turn an edible into chocolate.
[166:42.38]Hmm.
[166:46.50]Nah.
[166:48.11]It's kind of one of the reasons why I don't like to drink screwdrivers.
[166:53.14]Which is vodka and orange juice.
[166:57.62]Because it ruins the orange juice for me for the rest of my life.
[167:01.58]When you drink a screwdriver, it just kind of tastes like a gross orange juice.
[167:05.40]And orange juice is probably my favorite juice liquid.
[167:12.59]So, no.
[167:13.35]It kind of ruins my favorite thing.
[167:14.75]Not doing it.
[167:20.54]Do you like Bloody Marys?
[167:23.28]Um, not really.
[167:29.05]I prefer, I don't know, I don't like when alcohol tastes like food.
[167:36.66]No, no thanks.
[167:37.98]Sorry, when I order a drink, I don't want a soup.
[167:42.70]An alcoholic soup does not sound like a good thing to me.
[167:49.91]What about a mimosa?
[167:51.23]Nah.
[167:56.03]What about whiskey?
[167:56.67]Whiskey is good.
[168:00.81]Coffee brandy.
[168:01.55]I don't think I've ever had it before.
[168:09.20]What's your favorite alcoholic drink?
[168:10.52]I think it's always been vodka pineapple or vodka cranberry.
[168:24.50]Pina Colada is good, but it's just too much sugar.
[168:33.27]What's your favorite shoes?
[168:35.21]Skechers.
[168:36.65]You knew that already, though.
[168:38.43]You already knew that.
[168:42.68]Losing viewers.
[168:43.78]Good.
[168:43.96]Good.
[168:53.94]Do you have Kahlua?
[168:56.36]I think maybe once or twice.
[168:57.88]Okay.
[169:04.00]That concludes the alcohol Q&A.
[169:08.82]What's your favorite sushi?
[169:14.16]In the year 2056, you're going to make a breakthrough with cloning technology, and you're going to make an exact copy of yourself.
[169:21.91]Okay, we need to ban that person because that was just a weird fucking message.
[169:26.55]Okay.
[169:26.95]That was just a fucking weird message.
[169:34.99]Alright.
[169:35.35]I was like, oh, what did this person say?
[169:37.27]No, we're not going to read that one.
[169:45.13]Is your favorite sushi roll a Vegas roll?
[169:49.63]No, I think spicy tuna is what I actually like.
[169:53.95]Spicy tuna or a California roll.
[169:57.87]I don't, I'm not really big into sushi.
[170:00.39]Philadelphia roll is good sometimes, but I have very, very sparingly.
[170:03.51]I don't eat it that much.
[170:04.27]You gonna sneeze, Otto?
[170:09.46]Otto is right here.
[170:10.58]He's like over there.
[170:12.54]Alright.
[170:12.94]Are we ready?
[170:14.48]Let us begin.
[170:15.90]New game.
[170:17.30]Beginner.
[170:18.38]One player.
[170:19.70]Randomize the planets.
[170:27.59]I think I'm cool with this.
[170:37.29]Same competition.
[170:38.23]Okay.
[170:41.71]Company name.
[170:42.77]And this time I'm doing a fast ship.
[170:47.35]Or maybe a ship that has a ton of cargo already.
[170:52.60]How about Mr. Green?
[170:56.46]Mr. Green.
[171:00.78]Or how about the Greens?
[171:04.26]The Greens Express.
[171:06.82]That sounds like a pretty good, right?
[171:10.03]Green and Greens Enterprises.
[171:12.77]The Greens Express.
[171:15.81]Oh, we need a, I want a fast ship.
[171:17.95]It doesn't have to be that fast.
[171:19.31]10 passengers, four corp engine.
[171:27.37]90 tons.
[171:29.27]Only needs 3 crew.
[171:30.17]This thing actually might be pretty good.
[171:31.27]4 corp?
[171:35.37]This is a 7 corp engine.
[171:37.01]This thing is a speed demon.
[171:39.99]Okay, 100 tons of cargo.
[171:44.05]It has only 20 tons of fuel.
[171:49.50]You guys have to remind me.
[171:50.48]I think I want this one.
[171:53.06]I want to be zipping around.
[171:57.75]Let's see.
[171:58.43]What are the other fast looking ones?
[171:59.63]5 corp.
[172:03.71]I want at least a 5 or a 6 corp.
[172:08.17]This is a 2 corp.
[172:10.22]Nope.
[172:14.98]This feels like the most balanced out of all of them.
[172:18.10]Pick the le Reddit rock.
[172:23.35]That's a huge fuel tank.
[172:28.96]Only 80 tons of cargo.
[172:30.06]5 corp?
[172:32.18]This thing actually might be pretty good.
[172:33.24]7 corp for the, okay, globulizer.
[172:42.59]Only 80 ton cargo.
[172:43.71]This actually might be the one.
[172:45.39]What's the comparison to this one?
[172:46.43]4 crew members.
[172:48.77]4 crew members.
[172:51.97]I think we're going to, yeah, we'll do globulizer.
[172:59.40]We need to upgrade the cargo space.
[173:06.50]Can you please play Kirby Super Star Ultra OST?
[173:12.86]Yeah.
[173:13.74]Kirby Super Star Ultra.
[173:14.74]I think I can make that happen.
[173:21.58]Kirby Super Star Ultra OST.
[173:34.79]Okay.
[173:39.19]This looks like it.
[173:50.38]Is there a couple different versions?
[173:52.14]Is this for the DS?
[174:01.98]Okay, an assortment of songs from...
[174:04.97]Yeah, this is the one.
[174:05.73]This will be good.
[174:11.05]The grand opening.
[174:13.17]Loop extended for 10 minutes.
[174:14.95]Let's find out.
[174:23.39]Okay.
[174:25.05]I'm feeling it.
[174:25.39]We're going to make it low, though.
[174:27.89]I don't want it to be too loud.
[174:37.44]Okay.
[174:39.24]We start on Nosh.
[174:41.88]Everyone's in the same playing field.
[174:43.56]I can pick up six passengers.
[174:49.73]Turn it up.
[174:57.13]I can make... Just $6,000 right off the bat.
[175:01.99]Why is this on the loo?
[175:03.05]What is this?
[175:07.25]Oh, it's OK.
[175:07.91]Right.
[175:09.51]Grand opening loop extended.
[175:11.79]Alright.
[175:12.09]Well, let's get to the end of this one.
[175:17.33]I already owe nine.
[175:18.29]No, I don't.
[175:25.91]Place is cool looking.
[175:27.13]Uh oh.
[175:31.83]Nosh is the fuel depot of Kukubia.
[175:35.11]And you hear that Zobrok, a big time wholesaler, is selling fuel at 53% off the retail price.
[175:42.33]In other words, Zobrok is selling fuel at 764 kubars per ton.
[175:47.48]Yeah.
[175:50.90]Oh, my tank's already full.
[175:57.00]We're not looping anymore.
[176:00.09]Alright, we're making good decisions now.
[176:05.21]We are buying, already right off the bat, a shitload of exotic.
[176:10.87]As much as I can possibly buy.
[176:15.79]I need to take a loan out.
[176:16.98]I'm taking out a personal loan.
[176:21.60]Of 50 grand, right off the bat.
[176:23.48]Because we're buying the entire supply of exotics.
[176:37.61]And we're going to take the exotics to Tilo.
[176:42.59]Because we're going to buy Kryptunes as well.
[176:48.36]Beautiful.
[176:49.94]Good.
[176:52.42]Buy insurance.
[176:53.42]That's $8,300 for one week.
[176:55.08]We're not doing it.
[176:56.12]Alright.
[176:58.60]We're heading to Tilo.
[177:01.90]Wait.
[177:02.64]We should buy stock.
[177:06.79]Where are we right now?
[177:07.41]We're on Nosh?
[177:10.13]Nosh is already... It's time to get in.
[177:14.13]It's time to get in right now.
[177:18.56]This is the first day of the market ever.
[177:21.40]And this is a... What do they do?
[177:23.04]It's fuel?
[177:23.78]Fuel is always ridiculously priced.
[177:29.06]Alright, the trip to Tilo begins.
[177:30.68]Let's go.
[177:42.28]How do you get there ahead of me?
[177:43.40]I have a seven quark ship.
[177:47.20]A gambler's planet.
[177:49.50]Wait a minute.
[177:52.23]Cool.
[177:56.87]News.
[178:00.33]Okay.
[178:03.47]So, what can I do here?
[178:05.20]Casino dealer.
[178:06.46]Oh, let's go.
[178:07.66]Tilo is the only planet in Cucubia with legalized gambling.
[178:11.46]If you're feeling lucky, you can try your hand at Tilo's most popular game.
[178:14.78]All or nothing.
[178:16.67]If you win, you'll double whatever you bet.
[178:18.67]If you lose, the fun is over.
[178:20.93]Please keep in mind that under Imperial law, no one is allowed to gamble more than 5% of their total cash in one week.
[178:30.68]I was one.
[178:32.30]You just won 1500 kubars.
[178:34.47]You now have the option of going for double or nothing.
[178:36.33]Double or nothing.
[178:37.85]Again.
[178:39.23]Double or nothing again.
[178:39.91]Oh, wait, you can't do it.
[178:45.31]Oh, I can't do it more than once.
[178:46.49]OK.
[178:51.75]Cool.
[178:57.12]We're fine because look at this exotic that I'm about to just... I'm about to make like already like a hundred million dollars.
[179:02.44]Ticket price needs to be 3k.
[179:04.24]What's up with this?
[179:08.00]Okay.
[179:08.70]No, no, no.
[179:09.56]Ticket price.
[179:10.14]Yeah.
[179:17.22]Is it going to be big?
[179:19.34]Ooh, that's pretty big.
[179:22.88]These sell for a lot too.
[179:25.16]I'm just going to go for it.
[179:25.92]I need money now.
[179:28.89]Alright, we've got 76,000.
[179:34.66]Is this one loop extended as well?
[179:37.32]It is.
[179:37.56]Okay.
[179:38.54]We're going to get to the end of this one too.
[179:45.20]I'm going to buy shares on it.
[179:46.50]You know what?
[179:46.84]If you buy shares from every single planet, one of them has to do well, right?
[179:51.31]That's my theory.
[180:07.79]I don't want to buy Cantaloupe.
[180:10.93]Umbrellas.
[180:11.51]We'll do Umbrellas.
[180:12.35]We'll bring Umbrellas to Loro.
[180:15.64]That sounds good to me.
[180:20.42]And then... I don't want to spend that much money.
[180:23.66]But... I'm going to pay back 26,000.
[180:30.88]And we're going to head to Loro.
[180:37.14]Couple places I haven't seen before.
[180:38.22]Hey, Pleasure Planet.
[180:53.88]Hey, that ain't me.
[180:54.70]Koreans Express is number one right now.
[181:11.99]Polyester.
[181:13.43]We'll take it back to Tilo and we'll gamble.
[181:15.81]Oh no, no, no.
[181:19.06]Maybe I'll buy exotic too and take it back to Tilo.
[181:21.26]Alright, polyester and exotic.
[181:22.46]We're going back to Tilo.
[181:33.15]Ooh, 6,000.
[181:34.53]Nice.
[181:37.25]Things look good.
[181:37.83]Back to Tilo and we're going to gamble.
[181:41.75]Okay, here comes the secret bid.
[181:45.29]This is for a 200 ton ship upgrade.
[181:48.99]We have to go high with this.
[181:51.73]We need to get an advantage right off the bat, I think.
[181:56.22]I'm going to say $100,000.
[182:00.04]My credit limit is low, though.
[182:01.36]Okay, I have... No, I can't be... I don't have that much money. $75,000.
[182:19.27]What the fuck?
[182:20.62]Oh dude, what?
[182:31.04]Dude, the last person that bought this bought it for like $150,000.
[182:38.62]Oh my god.
[182:39.68]Okay.
[182:43.78]Well.
[182:45.42]Oh.
[182:48.34]Um.
[182:53.83]Where's T-Lo?
[182:56.03]T-Lo on the rise.
[182:57.03]Let's go.
[183:06.73]It's not bad yet.
[183:10.31]It's not bad yet.
[183:18.92]Everything is okay.
[183:20.30]I still have capital.
[183:21.66]I need to pay this down.
[183:22.90]I need to pay the crew.
[183:24.14]I need to pay my taxes.
[183:28.00]And... No, I need the money.
[183:49.66]Fuck!
[183:56.18]Alright, babble seeds.
[183:57.12]We're taking babble seeds to Mira.
[184:00.60]How do you only have 27 of these?
[184:02.84]What about gems?
[184:11.60]These gems, no.
[184:12.66]I can't.
[184:17.14]I'm buying all the exotic on Miro.
[184:19.92]I'm buying all the exotic and I'm buying all the toasters.
[184:23.31]We gotta go.
[184:27.09]Where am I going down here?
[184:31.61]That's it?
[184:36.02]So anybody that lands on Tilo, I get 600 bucks.
[184:39.11]So it's a secret bid with something tiny.
[184:41.25]How about 10k?
[184:42.91]Music's too loud.
[184:44.27]Probably a little bit better.
[185:03.16]Alright, I got it.
[185:03.86]I got it.
[185:04.14]I got it.
[185:04.44]I got it.
[185:06.72]$10,000.
[185:06.76]That's not bad.
[185:07.84]That's not bad.
[185:10.74]I invested a ton of money already.
[185:14.91]So now... Things are picking up.
[185:19.65]Because I just... I got the ship upgrade.
[185:22.29]And now it's $600 every time somebody touches that planet.
[185:31.66]Sell the babble seeds.
[185:36.14]Not bad.
[185:37.90]Now we buy all the exotic I can possibly buy.
[185:41.02]Because it is dog shit cheap right now.
[185:49.82]Yep.
[185:50.42]And we take this to... We're gonna take it to Pyke.
[185:52.76]We have never been to Pyke either.
[185:54.90]Buy all the exotic I can buy.
[185:56.08]It's gonna be expensive, but I need to do it.
[185:57.84]Okay.
[186:03.12]What else is needed on Pyke?
[186:07.32]Toasters.
[186:07.72]Okay.
[186:14.66]Okay.
[186:15.54]Like, I need fuel.
[186:17.76]How much is fuel?
[186:19.12]Not bad.
[186:28.23]Insurance.
[186:30.95]It is not that expensive.
[186:34.75]I can't tap into my credit line.
[186:36.21]I could, but...
[186:42.55]OK, can I get a blessing?
[186:46.74]Damn it.
[186:52.22]The Loro exchange is looking to see profits in the long term.
[186:56.27]Loro exchange is going to go high.
[187:00.81]OK, that's fine.
[187:01.57]Alright, I'm going to go to Pike.
[187:06.73]We've never been to Pike before.
[187:13.91]You stumble into a crowd of mad mooglers.
[187:17.45]A rowdy group of anarchists.
[187:19.65]To prove their point, they trash your ship causing $12,000 worth of damage.
[187:29.42]No!
[187:29.86]What do you mean the secret?
[187:34.24]You just broke a secret deal.
[187:46.21]I'm glad I bought it before I got here.
[187:48.61]Home of the El Tech Engine.
[187:54.72]Whoa.
[187:55.02]Uh oh.
[188:15.39]That's where I am.
[188:21.15]While on Pike, you can obtain the best deals on new 9 Quarp engines.
[188:26.96]Oh, that's like nothing.
[188:30.02]That's nothing.
[188:36.56]What?
[188:39.37]What are you talking about?
[188:40.47]The 9 Quarp engines have a problem.
[188:47.00]You've got to be fucking kidding me.
[188:52.88]Well.
[188:54.92]Exotics are going to... Toasters are going to go for a lot and exotics.
[188:57.82]I could also buy... I could take the exotics to Tilo and gamble.
[189:02.47]Toasters.
[189:03.45]Let's sell those.
[189:07.53]I need the money now.
[189:11.31]Yeah, I got... I got these... These insane loans.
[189:17.96]Look at this.
[189:18.60]I owe.
[189:23.12]Okay.
[189:25.98]What on Earth do you guys have here?
[189:31.27]Lava lamps.
[189:33.41]Frog legs.
[189:38.25]Okay.
[189:38.59]We're going to go back to frack.
[189:40.49]We're going to do lava lamps and ogle sands.
[189:51.80]Any passengers?
[189:52.70]No.
[189:57.70]Pay part of the loan?
[189:58.54]I can't.
[190:03.12]I only have $138.
[190:03.58]You gotta start growing your own shit, man.
[190:09.20]I know, I know.
[190:14.20]Well, I'll make some money on this.
[190:15.46]Let's go back to Frack.
[190:18.47]I can't do this.
[190:21.93]That's really good, but I gotta skip out on it.
[190:24.81]I don't have any money.
[190:27.36]I do own the other one.
[190:32.60]But that's where all my money is gonna get made.
[190:34.72]I guess we'll listen.
[191:01.33]But what do you mean a ghost-like spirit of Quasomuta?
[191:05.89]Who is this?
[191:08.51]Okay.
[191:08.99]Alright.
[191:09.25]I'll take the advice.
[191:09.85]No.
[191:31.34]That was so cheap to get that.
[191:37.49]Oh, nice.
[191:38.11]Hell yeah.
[191:39.71]9,000.
[191:47.13]Okay, Loro, I'm going to sell my lava lamps.
[191:52.26]Actually, that worked out.
[191:54.80]Thank goodness they needed them.
[191:59.61]Okay, so if I get some more sands, I'll bring them to Freck.
[192:05.10]And moon ferns.
[192:13.32]The maximum I can have.
[192:16.68]Now I'll go to Freck.
[192:26.11]Uh, let the crew have some fun.
[192:29.72]Ooh!
[192:30.04]After a few days on Loro, your crew feels so relaxed that you managed to talk them into reducing their salary from 1,500 to 1,400 kubars per person.
[192:41.39]Very nice.
[192:45.96]Alright.
[192:47.36]Good.
[192:49.14]Gonna make it to Frack.
[192:55.43]Another Loro one, secret bid.
[192:58.27]I'll do $15,000.
[192:59.09]I don't think I can even afford this.
[193:03.05]No.
[193:03.23]I can't.
[193:05.38]$10,000?
[193:05.46]This is like Monopoly if you were going to try to recreate it from memory on LSD.
[193:20.50]Oh, Vandergrief helps out poor old Teal.
[193:27.78]Yeah, it was always going to go for a lot.
[193:31.34]Wait a minute.
[193:31.92]This is big.
[193:33.50]Unexpected record harvest.
[193:34.64]The supply of agricultural goods on frack temporarily soars.
[193:40.47]Okay.
[193:40.79]Prices plummet on cantaloupe, jelly beans, moon ferns, frog legs, whipped cream, and seeds.
[193:45.45]Wait.
[193:45.69]I don't think that's good for me.
[193:52.61]Fuck.
[193:53.23]That's not good for me.
[193:57.69]Oh yeah, it is.
[193:59.45]Oh wow.
[194:00.27]That's $56,000.
[194:01.71]Holy shit.
[194:07.18]Okay.
[194:12.38]That just saved the run.
[194:16.11]Now I can buy up.
[194:17.35]I'm going to dump the moon ferns because who needs the moon ferns right now?
[194:24.25]nobody but babble seeds we go to nosh polyester and babble seeds or even whipped cream and go to mira okay alright so this is what I'm gonna do they have a ton
[194:50.38]Babel seeds and a ton of whipped cream.
[194:53.12]I think I take the Babel seeds.
[195:00.48]Nosh just buy as many as I can, or maybe take the polyester, but polyester, how much does polyester go for one 12 Babel seeds is going to be like two 40.
[195:12.76]Yeah.
[195:15.42]Buy all the Babel seeds.
[195:17.13]I'm going to get rid of these because I want room for more seeds.
[195:22.49]120.
[195:22.65]Now we go to Nosh or Loro.
[195:29.99]Which one is likely to stay lower?
[195:35.83]Wait, what do I own shares in?
[195:37.67]T-Low and Nosh.
[195:39.82]Where's T-Low?
[195:47.66]They're both doing pretty good.
[195:48.62]OK.
[196:00.13]Let's make our way over to Nash.
[196:07.19]Is backseating OK?
[196:09.39]I'm not doing this.
[196:10.95]It's crazy.
[196:11.76]It's a really good deal.
[196:13.24]No.
[196:15.72]Emergency service request.
[196:19.83]Tatalus, an emergency passenger broker, says that he has 10 passengers desperate to get to Nosh this week.
[196:25.45]I'm already going there.
[196:28.75]If you take them on board, he'll give you 5,000 per passenger?
[196:34.12]Wait a minute.
[196:34.92]What are these things?
[196:37.56]Is this like a parasite?
[196:38.38]Is it going to attach to one of my crew members' brains or something?
[196:41.44]50k?

[197:26.11]Another 35k.
[197:29.69]We're done.
[197:34.92]I'm gonna put... Pay the crew.
[197:37.82]I just paid the crew.
[197:38.78]It should be alright.
[197:39.38]I got- This insurance is not bad.
[197:41.44]I'm buying it.
[197:48.28]Okay.
[197:50.36]Oh, these gems.
[197:53.50]Ooh, T-Lo.
[197:55.38]Look at T-Lo.
[197:57.02]Cryptunes, X-Fuels, and Gems.
[198:01.04]Exotics.
[198:02.26]Okay.
[198:02.96]Cryptunes, X-Fuels, and Exotic.
[198:10.18]Should I just buy all the Exotic?
[198:18.24]Yeah, buy as much of this as I can and the X-Fuels.
[198:22.94]In fact,
[198:27.33]I'm going to store these and buy even more.
[198:29.37]So I'm going to store 50 Kryptunes here.
[198:38.93]Okay.
[198:41.64]Because X-Fuels are worth a little bit more, probably.
[198:45.14]So then, remember, we've got to remember there's 50 Kryptunes on this planet.
[198:52.74]Pay Zin's loan?
[198:55.28]Yeah, this is starting to become a pain.
[198:58.60]Alright.
[199:01.10]We're going to TLO.
[199:03.69]Big deal.
[199:04.15]Let's go.
[199:08.37]I bought insurance, so nothing's going to happen to me.
[199:20.08]I think that's worth doing.
[199:20.92]$28,000.
[199:20.94]I did just refinance.
[199:32.95]No, that's supposed to be my friend.
[199:38.21]Okay.
[199:42.03]I got 5,000 from having the facility on Tilo.
[199:48.54]We're coming back.
[199:50.52]I also keep in mind we're not going to make the same mistake.
[199:56.64]I'm going to hold this until Tilo is at least like 5k.
[199:58.56]Okay.
[200:06.76]Look at that market price on both of these.
[200:09.28]So ridiculous.
[200:10.48]Okay.
[200:11.00]This is going to be big.
[200:13.94]35K in profit.
[200:17.06]Nice.
[200:17.46]Back to 100,000.
[200:19.24]Alright.
[200:22.06]I'm getting rid of this.
[200:23.12]No.
[200:28.36]I could pay the Zin loan down by what?
[200:30.30]Like 50K?
[200:35.66]Hey, the crew.
[200:36.28]Fuck.
[200:38.46]I had money.
[200:39.82]I don't have any more money.
[200:40.60]I owe a ton of taxes.
[200:47.16]Okay.
[200:53.45]Fuck off.
[201:02.01]We're taking oxygen to Oom.
[201:12.76]Okay.
[201:14.42]To OOM?
[201:16.46]We've never been to OOM.
[201:17.26]That's fine.
[201:26.55]That's fine.
[201:27.43]Hey, I'm already at seven quarks.
[201:29.33]What the fuck do you know?
[201:32.11]Trading corp pumps money into the stock market.
[201:38.82]Ooh, we got another one of these.
[201:42.42]Unexpected surge in production.
[201:43.46]The supply of manufactured temporarily soars.
[201:46.69]Prices plummet on diapers, umbrellas, toasters, polyester hair tonic, and lava lamps.
[201:53.69]Fortune teller planet.
[201:54.65]What does that mean?
[202:02.90]Wow.
[202:05.28]Oxygen is going through the roof right now.
[202:10.64]Nice.
[202:11.46]Worked out.
[202:12.58]Okay.
[202:15.64]Wow.
[202:26.73]The Tilo exchange a number of big investors, including Mr. Zin.
[202:31.87]Can I look at that?
[202:33.71]Wow.
[202:38.31]I have six shares of Tilo.
[202:41.98]That's money right there.
[202:44.02]And hey, it's going up to 5K.
[202:49.80]Where am I now?
[202:50.44]I'm on Oom.
[202:51.50]Where's Oom?
[202:51.96]I'll buy some Oom.
[202:57.00]Oom is right here.
[203:04.53]Okay.
[203:07.79]What do we got?
[203:10.83]There are a ton of toasters.
[203:15.14]Pretty much we just need to see what people need here.
[203:18.62]Okay.
[203:19.90]Loro needs toasters and lava lamps.
[203:25.28]Tilo also needs hair tonic and we want to go there to sell.
[203:30.06]Toasters and hair tonic and take it to Tilo?
[203:35.51]Lava lamp's probably worth more money.
[203:40.20]What is this game?
[203:41.10]Gazillionaire.
[203:41.80]Alright, we're going to go all in on lava lamps.
[203:45.94]There's so many here too.
[203:50.45]And I'm going to store 50 of them.
[203:56.49]Because there's so much.
[203:58.84]Let's buy another 50.
[204:03.78]Okay.
[204:05.48]And I'm going to advertise on the planet.
[204:08.84]So we're going to... Where are we heading to from here?
[204:11.78]Loro.
[204:14.20]Advertise on Loro.

[204:45.78]Hmm, the last one was one for like 30.
[204:51.40]I'll do 30.
[204:55.73]Lowball it?
[204:56.73]I think 30 is going to be fine.
[204:59.85]I can afford it.
[205:00.35]It's going to be like 34,000.
[205:03.49]Watch.
[205:03.61]Okay.
[205:03.75]Okay.

[206:47.92]We'll be back.
[206:50.86]I can't really buy anything.
[206:52.04]What about stocks?
[206:56.36]Did the stock market crash here too?
[206:58.81]Where's Laurel?
[206:59.77]Laurel is purple.
[207:01.95]I'll buy some shares in Laurel.
[207:10.17]Yeah.
[207:11.34]Because these could just bounce.
[207:13.96]This looks like it's starting to sell.
[207:20.27]Laurel.
[207:20.77]Yanny.
[207:24.33]Yanny.
[207:26.29]Yanny.

[207:38.32]Laurel.
[207:38.72]Laurel.
[207:45.37]Can you, can anybody make that go Yanny or is it only that one guy's voice that could do it?

[208:06.04]Okay.
[208:07.43]Uh, I need to sell these shares cause it looks like it probably going to come down.
[208:14.35]Can't buy anything.
[208:15.37]So let's just go back to Tilo.
[208:18.03]So I can sell.
[208:29.58]No.
[208:33.04]Supreme Commander Dred Nicholson grants you an emergency tax break.
[208:37.64]Don't have to pay $2,000 in taxes.

[209:15.58]And then umbrellas.
[209:18.54]And where should I bring these gems?
[209:22.05]Nobody really needs it right now.
[209:23.25]Hmm.
[209:28.55]Back to Laurel?
[209:36.48]Just warehouse them instead?
[209:38.12]I guess I could, you know?
[209:48.09]And then what, just buy more umbrellas?
[209:52.97]And then we'll take the umbrellas to Loro.
[209:58.13]Loro.
[209:59.97]Loro.
[210:01.89]Loro.
[210:04.64]That's 9,000 every week if it's available.

[210:43.15]Yeah, but an ATM from 1995?
[210:54.06]Alright, we are moving to Loro.
[210:58.56]Loro.

[211:52.04]I keep bringing them to the pleasure planet.
[211:56.00]Take us back there.
[211:56.76]We don't even need money.
[211:57.64]We just need pleasure.
[212:02.92]Another 9,000.
[212:03.28]I don't think I changed the price on that at all.
[212:07.10]I think it's a perfect spot.
[212:08.20]It's almost 10,000 every time I go anywhere.
[212:19.07]How we doing?
[212:20.59]Umbrellas.
[212:21.81]Good.
[212:22.09]Do I have anything in the warehouse?
[212:23.25]No.
[212:28.34]Very nice.
[212:30.18]Polyester.
[212:32.78]Take it.
[212:33.42]Yeah.
[212:33.64]To here.
[212:40.43]What else do you got?
[212:43.45]I have gems still.
[212:47.74]I think I'm gonna store the gems here as well.
[212:54.86]I just bought this game on Steam for 20 bucks and it won't even open.
[213:10.87]Is it 20 bucks?
[213:13.71]It won't even open.
[213:16.07]I don't know what happened.
[213:18.40]The game is from like 1995.
[213:19.84]Hey, are you the McChicken guy?
[213:27.29]No, I'm a guy that ate a McChicken once three years ago, weirdly, and now it's like my entire fucking personality.
[213:46.24]Says the McChicken guy.
[213:48.86]Dude, you eat one- you eat like two pieces of food weirdly, and you're the eat food weirdly guy.
[213:57.52]We're talking about, in the grand universe scale of things, a blip in the universe.
[214:03.99]A tiny minuscule two moments.
[214:09.25]It's so insignificant if you think about it.
[214:12.71]I took a bite out of a chicken sandwich weirdly, and now I'm the chicken sandwich weird guy.
[214:20.64]Okay, we need to go to Nosh.
[214:25.50]What else does Nosh need?
[214:30.62]Nothing really.
[214:31.24]I need... Okay, this is the fuel planet.
[214:34.56]We're going to see if we can get a better deal.
[214:37.38]You ate a glove, dude.
[214:38.72]I did not eat a glove.
[214:42.27]That's worth it.
[214:43.87]This is worth doing.
[214:53.22]Because you have been complaining so much about how difficult it is to run a business, and how the competition is driving you under, your crew reluctantly agrees to forget about any money you owe them.
[215:03.61]That means you don't have to pay $7,800 in wages.
[215:05.05]Okay.
[215:05.19]We're fine.
[215:20.21]It's time.
[215:21.27]How much is gas?
[215:22.01]A thousand.
[215:22.53]Let's see if I can get it for cheaper.
[215:26.20]There it is.
[215:26.58]46% off.
[215:29.34]Okay.
[215:29.68]I'm going to, I want to buy the whole, I want to fill my whole tank.
[215:36.76]Saving $20,000 filling up through him.
[215:42.17]And I have, I, I I'm in debt again.
[215:49.63]Somehow.
[215:53.15]Get rid of the polyester.
[215:59.55]I can buy some more gems.
[216:04.12]I have so many gems now.
[216:08.22]Who needs gems?
[216:09.00]I have a shitload.
[216:10.56]Loro needs gems.
[216:13.54]Where am I storing the gems?
[216:17.06]Is it Loro?
[216:19.63]I think I'm storing 50 gems on Loro.
[216:25.75]There's 50 Cryptoons here.
[216:27.79]How much are Cryptoons worth?
[216:33.25]Hmm.
[216:37.53]They're over on Yanny.
[216:41.99]What?
[216:47.05]They're over here, aren't they?
[216:48.93]Oh, I see what you're doing.
[216:56.72]Another secret bid.
[216:58.22]No, I don't care.
[216:59.00]When are you going to eat dog food?
[217:05.86]Okay, I need to start depositing money.
[217:07.19]And wait, free warehouse upgrade.
[217:11.49]In order to encourage you to use the warehouse more often, the traders union increases your warehouse space to 75 for free.
[217:20.90]You happen across Meeg, a true technoid.
[217:23.76]Okay, this is to replace one of my crew.
[217:27.52]It's 23... No.
[217:29.75]That's not worth it.
[217:35.01]Hey, we're back on the pleasure planet.
[217:39.24]Go have fun.
[217:42.80]Your crew has a wonderful time surfing the Vorpal Pool, stuffing themselves with the Laurinian grapes and Wawa pies, and dancing the night away.
[217:50.72]I take care of my crew, okay?
[217:54.10]I mean, I owe you guys ten grand, but... Did you remember the pies?
[218:00.84]The Wawa pies?
[218:03.34]And the... whatever else was there?
[218:05.64]Wasn't that cool?
[218:09.04]I think they're getting over it.
[218:11.59]Yeah, they're kind of getting over it.
[218:12.93]I keep taking them to, like, a vacation spot.
[218:18.21]I've owed them, like, $40,000 in wages.
[218:22.30]But I keep taking them to this planet and drop them off to eat, like... Oh, get those passengers.
[218:33.24]Yeah, there's four of them.
[218:33.99]12,000.
[218:34.11]Nice.
[218:34.71]Alright.
[218:41.40]42.
[218:41.46]No.
[218:42.34]No.
[218:45.32]The gems aren't even here.
[218:46.69]Why would you lie to me?
[218:51.91]Pike is seeing a drop in gem prices or a raise in gem prices.
[218:59.68]Okay.
[219:01.46]I don't think I want to sell these.
[219:04.09]I mean, I could get like 50, 60 grand or hold them.
[219:08.74]And in fact, even just buy more.
[219:11.26]Oh, there's no gems on this whole planet.
[219:22.85]Alright.
[219:23.27]I need, where are those gems stored?
[219:32.15]I got shit everywhere.
[219:33.63]Tilo has 50 tons, 50 tons.
[219:35.25]I got a lot of stuff.
[219:36.21]And it's on Pike?
[219:39.43]No, I got nothing on Pike.
[219:40.33]Is it in Oom?
[219:43.33]It's not on Nosh.
[219:45.21]Maybe it is in Tilo.
[219:51.77]I'll buy some moon ferns if I go to Tilo.
[219:59.11]And I'll gamble again, just real quick.
[220:07.15]big.
[220:07.45]I don't have a whole lot to work with, but I'm going to say 40,000.
[220:18.14]You'll leak.
[220:19.92]Okay.
[220:22.08]Damn it.
[220:23.44]67.
[220:27.42]Ooh.
[220:31.18]Ooh.
[220:32.80]Look who came here.
[220:35.11]With their gems.
[220:39.01]Somebody came here with their gems.
[220:43.42]Adam Sandler, 10 out of 10 impression.
[220:45.78]Thank you.
[220:46.60]I'll take it.
[220:55.14]My payment.
[221:03.53]Hell yeah.
[221:04.47]This might be the biggest sale of the entire, entire day.
[221:11.93]Wow.
[221:13.17]That is $96,000 in profit.
[221:17.09]I think it's worth a lot.
[221:19.55]If you ask me.
[221:21.79]Even the ferns, they're worth 120.
[221:23.67]And would you look at that inside the warehouse?
[221:31.29]There's 50 more gems.
[221:33.49]Which if I take that to the marketplace.
[221:37.45]I got another $94,000 prop.
[221:38.31]Yeah!
[221:38.73]One more.
[221:39.03]Fuck you.
[222:00.93]Okay, paying the loans done.
[222:17.04]Oh, I owe a lot.
[222:17.90]Okay, there we go.
[222:18.72]We're fine.
[222:20.38]So.
[222:22.88]I keep dropping cash.
[222:24.98]That was a... Okay, buy the fuel, honestly.
[222:27.74]Okay.
[222:29.22]Might as well just max it out.
[222:30.08]It's only $400.
[222:31.22]It's only $400, okay?
[222:31.78]It's only $400, okay?
[222:33.12]You sound like you're going to do the coin toss thing again.
[222:44.21]Pay off the loan.
[222:45.17]No, I don't want to be... I need cash to buy stuff.
[222:51.87]Look.
[222:52.85]Do you see what's going on here?
[222:55.18]Do you see the supply...
[223:00.03]Look, I can buy, look at these umbrellas.
[223:07.58]Look at how many umbrellas I can buy.
[223:09.48]I have 160 spaces now.
[223:12.32]Don't tell me, me getting this from 120 to 160 was a bad idea.
[223:17.18]Don't you come here with that.
[223:18.72]Because we're going to fill it with umbrellas.
[223:25.29]That's about 160 umbrellas.
[223:30.84]And we're going to OOM.
[223:35.18]Right now.
[223:39.36]Secret bid.
[223:39.90]200 more spaces.
[223:42.46]I've got some wiggle room here.
[223:43.92]60,000.
[223:43.94]Dude, you're retired.
[223:50.43]Why are you getting so mad?
[224:00.33]You haven't checked the stock market in a while?
[224:01.77]That's true.
[224:03.47]I think I'm doing 60.
[224:07.30]Or do I say no?
[224:11.38]Because I'm in a good position right now.
[224:13.68]No, we're going to skip it.
[224:18.56]We're going to skip it.
[224:21.80]This was a big deal for us last time.
[224:26.42]She wants to go to Nosh.
[224:28.28]She wants to be reunited.
[224:32.53]Okay.
[224:39.70]$43,000.
[224:39.76]There we are.
[224:40.84]Now we're in an even better position.
[224:48.18]We're on nosh though.
[224:51.23]I don't care about that.
[224:53.71]Take a look.
[224:54.73]Okay.
[224:55.63]71 K. I've got a warehouse full of crypt tunes.
[225:01.51]What is that worth here?
[225:05.43]Cryptunes, Cryptunes, Cryptunes.
[225:07.72]Do you even want Cryptunes?
[225:11.66]Can I even sell my Cryptunes?
[225:17.40]I could make a lot on this.
[225:19.89]Yep.
[225:22.11]114 in cash.
[225:25.25]Warehouse.
[225:25.75]Pull these out.
[225:34.61]I could buy more of these, actually, because they're dirt cheap here.
[225:41.42]Let's buy even more Cryptoons.
[225:44.40]And you know what?
[225:46.24]Wait, you don't?
[225:48.50]Oh.
[225:50.12]I see.
[225:52.85]Big demand on Loro.
[225:57.69]Where is Loro?
[226:01.45]Yep.
[226:06.01]X Fuels.
[226:06.51]Okay, let's buy some X Fuels and bring it to Loro.
[226:11.81]Okay, we're going to Loro now.
[226:25.33]All paid up.
[226:26.57]I'm going to pay this entire loan back.
[226:29.69]No more personal loan.
[226:31.27]We're going to deposit...
[226:33.58]$30,000 into the bank.
[226:34.46]This is the first time I've ever had money.
[226:38.96]Actually, bank the whole thing.
[226:42.61]Wait, maybe I should take out like $5,000 just to make sure nothing happens.
[226:47.93]Okay, I've got $56,000 in the bank.
[226:49.37]This is a 2% interest a week.
[226:50.05]29% off retail.
[226:50.33]Should I do it?
[227:02.75]No, I got plenty of fuel.
[227:06.39]OK.
[227:08.65]We're heading to Loro.
[227:16.06]Do octopuses poop?
[227:17.26]That's a good question.
[227:18.06]I don't know.
[227:22.92]The stakes are pretty low here.
[227:26.26]Whatever, I just gave that guy $800 for no reason.
[227:34.67]Sorry, dude.
[227:35.39]Hey crew.
[227:39.12]Now I owe you $10,000, but you know, go have fun.
[227:47.66]At what point does it get old to come here?
[227:56.64]That X feels is going for a lot.
[227:59.46]Nice.
[228:01.44]Look at these Cryptoons.
[228:04.52]Boom.
[228:08.44]Alright.
[228:09.38]There's not a whole lot.
[228:10.96]Do I have anything here?
[228:12.25]Get those passengers.
[228:13.21]That's another 10k.
[228:17.09]I got 57,000 in the bank.
[228:17.87]I got 1,000 in interest last week.
[228:18.89]I got 88.
[228:19.05]No.
[228:19.11]Let's do...
[228:32.16]I got $100,000 in the bank.
[228:35.18]Pay the loan?
[228:35.64]No, no, no.
[228:35.90]We're going to grow this and then it'll be good.
[228:37.79]We'll be good.
[228:39.53]We'll be good.
[228:40.09]No, I'll be fine.
[228:40.95]This is going to get more interest than this is going to be interest.
[228:45.29]You'll see.
[228:45.61]Okay, where do I want to go?
[228:53.33]Wait, what about the stock market?
[228:58.38]I'll take that.
[229:04.64]2,600 bucks.
[229:06.02]Gave me like 12,000.
[229:09.48]Pay the crew.
[229:10.92]Pay my taxes with that, with those winnings.
[229:17.16]Bank is 2%.
[229:18.18]Loan is 4%.
[229:19.08]That's true.
[229:20.28]But if there's 200,000 here, then it becomes, you know, hey, you know, you know,
[229:33.81]I want to go to... Where should I go right now?
[229:43.01]Maybe to... To Nosh and buy whipped cream?
[229:49.14]Or maybe to Mira to get... I'm going to go to Mira to buy either Moon Ferns or X-Fuels.
[230:00.82]This is a huge deal.
[230:03.22]I have the money.
[230:08.20]$3,800 every time somebody visits.
[230:10.14]I'm willing to put in a lot of fucking money.
[230:12.50]I have $113,000 in cash and $125,000 credit line.
[230:13.46]I need this.
[230:26.33]I'm willing to spend $125,000 on this.
[230:29.73]All in?
[230:30.29]No way.
[230:30.84]That's a bad idea.
[230:36.34]That's so much.
[230:37.36]I know, but this is that.
[230:38.96]Look at how much that is.
[230:39.96]Every time somebody visits.
[230:40.90]When I go back to Loro, it might be possible that I'll be making $20,000 to $30,000 every time I go there.
[230:45.13]$85,000 has it easy?
[230:45.51]You think so?
[230:45.85]$125,000 is way too high.
[230:56.56]It's gonna be like 30k.
[230:58.18]No way.
[230:59.02]For 4,000 kubars every time?
[231:01.84]I'm telling you, it's gonna go for over 100.
[231:04.89]I'm doing 100,000.
[231:10.27]Please?
[231:10.43]Please?
[231:21.87]Nice.
[231:22.97]I mean, not nice.
[231:23.80]That's sad, but nice.
[231:26.24]Oh, free advice.
[231:31.28]Okay.
[231:32.48]Mr. Zin typically offers a better rate than the Traders Union.
[231:34.92]If possible, don't pay off Mr. Zin's loan until you've completely paid off your Traders Union.
[231:39.58]Okay.
[231:42.10]Did we win the auction?
[231:47.60]Good.
[231:52.60]yes yes it turned out to be the right idea 100 000 next bid was 94k I think I actually might be able to win this if we if we play the if we play everything right we do it well that's a huge income stream okay so we got what do we got show supply
[232:25.21]Ooh, look at the exotics.
[232:27.99]Exotics.
[232:28.69]Over to Tilo.

[232:31.93]And we're going to go to Tilo.

[232:36.85]Look at how many.
[232:37.57]He's got 112.
[232:39.12]I need to take some money out of the bank.
[232:47.86]That's a big investment, but it's worth it.
[232:55.39]Go gamble 100K.
[232:59.55]Okay.

[234:25.09]With unyielding appetites, these wild beasts break into your ship and begin gobbling up everything, including a few of your crew members.
[234:32.00]Their corrosive saliva winds up causing $37,000 worth of damage.

[236:08.58]Okay, we're going to do Umbrellas and Cryptoons, going back to Loro, and we're going to collect.
[236:16.46]What's worth more, Cryptoons?
[236:17.98]Yeah.
[236:26.56]Now let's go collect the other money from Loro.
[236:36.25]You are fucking kidding me.

[237:04.90]I have 50 lava lamps here.
[237:11.63]Mmm...
[237:17.06]I don't know if I sell the Kryptunes here.
[237:18.86]It's not bad.
[237:27.17]I think I need the cash, though.
[237:30.11]Yeah, I need the cash.
[237:31.07]$19,000 for insurance.
[237:39.25]Sell the umbrellas?
[237:40.21]I did.

[238:09.10]We need some Babel seeds.
[238:13.68]What about the stalks?
[238:17.46]Alright, I should sell this now because I don't know if this is going to come back.
[238:25.46]Alright, 62.
[238:26.30]Get rid of this loan.
[238:30.96]Pay the Zin loan down a little.
[238:35.79]Bank.

[239:38.48]That's so unfortunate!
[239:42.68]Alright, whatever.
[239:43.38]Ooh.
[239:49.30]Do I have any of these?
[240:04.48]Nice.
[240:05.16]Lava lamps are still selling for a lot.
[240:06.98]So are the babble seeds.
[240:08.54]Okay, good.
[240:09.10]80,000.
[240:09.68]Alright.
[240:10.66]All this other stuff is really cheap, right?
[240:23.66]What do we got?
[240:25.36]Okay, I could buy... Polyester.
[240:30.90]Buy a shitload of polyester.
[240:37.72]That's like the best return I can get, I think.
[240:39.54]Maybe umbrellas, too?
[240:45.17]That's not a terrible price.
[240:46.27]Or diapers.
[240:47.17]Yeah, diapers.
[240:51.13]And now let me take the polyester...
[240:55.89]I do want to go back to Loro to collect, so I'm going to go back to Loro.
[241:00.89]Ooh, I owe a lot of money.
[241:03.35]God, that would have been a disaster.
[241:06.07]How much is fuel?

[241:31.04]$27,000.
[241:32.39]That's awesome.
[241:35.49]That was absolutely worth buying.
[241:49.06]I can probably take more passengers.
[241:52.48]okay I'm gonna do a pa I'm doing because I can do think 13 people we're advertising next week for passengers and it's four thousand dollars a seat now uh passengers we're gonna do we're gonna put some we're gonna put some ads in the newspaper

[242:29.76]Polyester.

[242:36.54]It's not a bad price.
[242:39.40]More money looking good.
[242:41.34]I could sell the diapers too.
[242:42.80]Yeah.
[242:51.50]Where do I have...

[244:41.44]He's got AIs that are playing it.
[244:46.60]It's funny stuff.
[244:49.23]I saw when the snowman...
[244:52.83]All I have to do is just make a slide down to the river out of my body.
[244:59.98]Everybody fell off a bridge.
[245:00.94]It was hilarious.
[245:02.56]Definitely go give DougDoug a follow if you haven't.
[245:04.54]I don't want to give any spoilers or anything, but...
[245:13.80]Alright, yeah, I'm willing to do $75,000 for this, right?
[245:16.92]For all the dog dog viewers that just came in.
[245:19.70]I need to put a maximum bid.
[245:21.31]I have to pay whatever my max bid is.
[245:24.93]It's not a case of like, oh, I'm going to put $100,000 here.
[245:26.93]And if the next bid is like $19,999, it'll be $20,000.
[245:27.99]Nope.
[245:28.09]It is if my max bid is $75,000 and the last one below me, the one before that is $20,000, I still have to spend $75,000.
[245:44.61]this is to have the privilege of taking money from people every time they land on this planet to the tune of sorry to the tune of 2500 80k or you're gonna go broke we know how bidding works yeah but some bidding is different I have to pay the whole 80k not whatever the max latest bid was
[246:13.00]Take the Raiders to the Pleasure Planet.
[246:14.93]Oh, absolutely.
[246:18.11]It's going to be like $35,000.
[246:19.33]Alright, I'm doing $75,000.
[246:20.83]And I'm going to be fucking furious if it's more than that.
[246:25.39]$20,000?
[246:25.43]That's a lot of money.
[246:26.37]Ah, whatever.
[246:26.81]I did it.
[246:27.11]It's $75,000.
[246:27.46]Is it going to be down the toilet?
[246:33.36]Oh, no.
[246:34.66]What is the evil... I don't think we've seen WikiWix.
[246:36.96]I don't know what that is.
[246:43.33]I should have done 100.
[246:46.11]I could have done 100,000.
[246:50.55]75k was too low.
[246:52.97]Damn it.
[246:56.56]Hey, that's why we come back to TLO, man.
[247:00.10]And we close our eyes and we click this button three times.
[247:07.76]I only have 400.
[247:08.82]No, that's not why I don't want to do that.
[247:10.20]No, what?
[247:13.10]No, I got to take some money out of the fucking bank first.
[247:16.65]We just OK.
[247:27.44]So for the DougDoug viewers that just came in, it's literally just you win or you don't.
[247:33.10]That's what gambling is in this game.
[247:34.94]So I just won.
[247:35.68]And if I press the button again, there's another coin flip that I will get another $6,500.
[247:41.08]So every time we press this button until we lose, which is a bad idea.
[247:48.53]Like that.
[247:50.47]That's just a bad idea.
[247:52.33]So I lost everything.
[247:59.19]Let's put $100,000 back in the bank.
[248:02.20]What's my loan at right now?
[248:03.70]$140,000?
[248:11.75]Why is he explaining a 50-50?
[248:13.17]It's not implied.
[248:17.79]Holy shit.
[248:18.93]Oh my god.
[248:19.61]I forgot I did the advertising.
[248:24.20]I just made $24,000.
[248:26.22]Will they pay $5,000 to ride on my cool green booger boat?
[248:35.44]Okay, would you pay $5,000 to ride this?
[248:39.77]I just made $24,000.
[248:40.63]Forget about buying and selling commodities.
[248:45.27]I think you just do a playthrough where you just do one of these huge ships, make it like $10,000, advertise the fuck out of it, and just make $100,000 a week.
[249:00.83]I'm going to advertise in a magazine.

[249:15.42]This is going to be huge.
[249:16.02]Alright.
[249:18.97]What can I buy here?
[249:19.93]Umbrellas.
[249:22.95]And then go to Nosh.
[249:24.43]Nosh is the gas planet.
[249:25.47]So that's, that's a good place to go.
[249:26.93]Alright.
[249:27.57]Umbrellas.
[249:29.35]Buy them up.
[249:32.17]And then we're going to go to Nosh.

[250:03.42]Well, that's just, I mean, I feel like it's just, hold it.
[250:07.07]I'm going to lose 6,000 kubars?
[250:15.79]You got to get out of this, yeah.
[250:22.91]Hey, well, you make a bad trade, you make a good trade.
[250:25.09]Who cares?
[250:33.20]Okay.

[254:22.35]We're good.
[254:28.29]Buying umbrellas and diapers and taking them to Oom.
[254:34.20]That's the play.

[259:53.65]I have about 130,000, 140,000. 120,000.
[260:10.85]That's the worst possible thing that could happen right now.
[260:13.02]That's the worst possible thing that... That's the actual worst thing that could have happened.
[260:17.70]I really hope I don't win that now.
[260:24.90]Oh, I'm actually really nervous that I just won it.
[260:27.97]Oh, no.

[264:45.35]Nothing bad can happen.
[264:51.83]I will be fine.
[264:52.75]I will be more than fine if we can actually make the trip to Tilo.
[265:01.52]I don't care about that.
[265:02.82]I'm not bidding a cent.
[265:05.58]Okay.
[265:10.66]Okay. $5,000?
[265:22.92]And this keeps going up.
[265:27.32]I owe $30,000 to the crew.
[265:29.74]What if I just don't pay them?
[265:34.54]Oh, this just saved the whole run.
[265:35.89]Oh, thank God.
[265:38.01]Look at this.
[265:38.49]Oh, okay.
[265:42.11]Everybody can relax, relax, relax, relax, relax.

[265:47.14]I need to pay back like 20 grand.
[265:50.44]I need to.
[265:51.56]That's so much money.
[265:55.64]That's so much money.
[265:57.00]I can't do that right now.
[265:58.87]Why is it $30,000 for insurance?
[266:02.63]What is going on in the world right now?
[266:07.15]You have to pay them.
[266:07.99]I can't pay them.
[266:09.37]I can't pay them.
[266:09.85]They're going to have to mute me.
[266:26.04]Alright, I paid everybody, okay?
[266:27.94]I paid my crew.
[266:28.83]I paid my friends.
[266:30.35]I paid my taxes.
[266:32.75]Okay, I have $15,000.
[266:34.55]We're good.
[266:35.89]What can I buy here?
[266:41.93]Lava lamps.
[266:42.61]And then we're going from lava lamps.
[266:44.61]We're buying all of them.
[266:45.37]We're going to Mira.
[266:52.31]I have $47.
[267:02.12]Okay.
[267:13.99]Fuck this.
[267:14.69]Oh my god, my ticket prices are way too high.
[267:23.11]Okay.
[267:23.90]Again, we just have to make it to Mira without anything bad happening.
[267:32.75]I didn't advertise.
[267:33.55]I don't have any money.
[267:39.36]Good.
[267:42.32]Good.
[267:43.32]That's two great things in a row.
[267:49.35]Flattening out a little while the rest of us catch up.
[267:56.62]Good.
[267:57.06]Lava lamps.
[267:58.26]I am going to make some money on those lava lamps to the tune of $77,000.
[268:03.62]What are you doing?
[268:16.49]Everything's according to plan.
[268:20.05]Please give me advice, oh great sage.
[268:25.51]Small blessing.
[268:28.12]But warn you to keep to the path of truth.
[268:33.34]Okay.
[268:36.34]Okay.
[268:37.16]I need fuel.
[268:39.52]Let's take a look at the chart because I got 5,000 waiting for me.
[268:45.03]Oh, no, I don't.
[268:47.89]Why is nobody visiting Pike?
[268:49.01]Okay, I got 11,000 on Loro. 26...
[268:57.11]Nobody is visiting Nosh or Pike.
[269:00.26]Except for me.
[269:02.64]Alright, maybe back to Loro.
[269:06.06]It's a moneymaker.
[269:13.95]Loro needs polyester.
[269:16.21]So let's buy a bunch of polyester from here.
[269:22.07]Back to Loro.
[269:28.59]Yikes.
[269:29.55]Another thing on Pike.
[269:30.49]Nobody goes there.
[269:31.21]We need some music?
[269:33.89]Yeah, we do.
[269:36.37]I can't do it.
[269:41.90]Check the news more often?
[269:43.06]That's true.
[269:46.68]I never would have been able to afford that.
[269:48.32]Okay, 20,000 I got.
[269:48.78]Just from visiting here.
[270:02.92]Oh, that's perfect.
[270:04.72]That's awesome.
[270:08.10]Okay.
[270:09.28]Doing well.
[270:10.14]I've got a few passengers.
[270:11.20]Pick them up.
[270:11.64]99,000.
[270:12.32]Okay.
[270:12.74]Let me take a look at the chart again.
[270:24.14]Still no money waiting for me on Pike.
[270:28.91]4,000 waiting for me on Tilo.
[270:31.53]Finally, somebody visited Nosh.
[270:32.67]I'm going to go to Nosh because I actually need gas.
[270:35.56]I need gas.
[270:36.64]Let's go to Nosh.
[270:38.24]What does Nosh need?
[270:41.70]Toasters.
[270:42.44]Perfect.
[270:43.40]Plenty here.
[270:49.28]What else is there?
[270:49.86]Big supply of here.
[270:50.64]Whipped cream.
[270:51.22]Yeah, I'll buy a bunch of whipped cream too.
[271:02.27]And then just cantaloupes, who cares?
[271:04.33]Okay.
[271:08.59]Tanosh.
[271:09.67]Check the news.
[271:10.29]Yeah, let me check the news.
[271:17.19]Okay, nothing.
[271:20.49]Nothing in the news, really.
[271:21.37]What about the weather?
[271:22.73]A stellar whirlpool is forming off Planet Pike.
[271:30.66]Isn't that where I'm going?
[271:33.81]I'm going to nosh.
[271:37.41]Watch out for that loan.
[271:40.45]Okay, I'm okay with this now.
[271:46.48]I'm not buying any stock.
[271:52.30]Advertise?
[271:52.94]I'll advertise after here.
[271:56.86]As part of a promotional package, El Tech Engine offers you a free upgrade from your 9 corp to a supercharged 10 corp.
[272:07.01]I'll take it.
[272:07.54]Ooh.
[272:08.90]Ooh.
[272:10.64]Your company is approached by the Wobbler, a starving artist.
[272:15.31]The Wobbler asks you to sponsor his next avant-garde theatrical production.
[272:20.23]It'll cost $18,000 and probably won't make any money.
[272:24.50]However, it will be an artistic masterpiece that will go down in history.
[272:30.68]Do you give him the money?
[272:34.18]I can swing this.
[272:37.03]Yes.
[272:40.92]The wobbler's experimental play turns out to be a surprise hit.
[272:45.56]The public flocks to see it.
[272:47.08]Supreme Commander Dred Nicholson calls it a national treasure.
[272:51.50]The wobbler repays you $55,000, three times your original investment.
[272:54.38]Nice.
[273:01.94]Oh, yup.
[273:02.24]Yup. Yup. Yup.
[273:17.42]That's what I was trying to do at the charity auction and I just looked like a fucking idiot, when I grabbed the mic.
[273:20.42]Okay - manuafactured goods soar.
[273:26.42]Diapers, umbrellas, toasters. Okay.
[273:31.24]Thanks for the money.
[273:33.71]So... What do I have?
[273:38.01]I have... Toasters and whipped cream and... No, that's too many toasters.
[273:47.18]Damn it.
[273:48.98]Oversupply of this shit, though.
[273:52.04]I'm gonna buy up all the lava lamps and store them.
[273:53.96]How much money do I have?
[273:54.67]I got plenty.
[274:00.67]Shit.
[274:00.79]I'm going to have to store the toasters.
[274:04.47]Sell the whipped cream.
[274:05.64]Who cares?
[274:08.22]And the cantaloupe.
[274:10.86]I don't even care if I lose money on those.
[274:15.58]Okay.
[274:17.20]Lava lamps.
[274:17.94]I'm getting for an unbelievable price here.
[274:21.64]I would like to store these lava lamps the maximum amount.
[274:28.03]And then I would like to buy more lava lamps.
[274:36.67]Okay.
[274:39.70]I then need to pay my crew.
[274:41.88]Pay my taxes.
[274:46.28]I need fuel.
[274:48.14]It's so expensive.
[274:49.20]Maybe I can get it cheap.
[274:56.09]That's not a big deal.
[274:57.99]Oh, why did I do that?
[275:06.96]Why did I do that?
[275:07.72]Why did I do that?
[275:08.50]Why did I do that?
[275:09.12]I thought, oh, my God, that's horrible, guys.
[275:11.18]What the fuck just happened?
[275:12.32]I OK, I thought it was going to give me an amount that I could buy.
[275:16.47]It said fill the tank up.
[275:19.21]I thought it was going to give me it like a slide, like a ball, like if I. Oh, that's an absolute fucking disaster.
[275:27.98]Oh my god, I thought it was going to give me an amount I could buy, like it typically is here.
[275:33.05]Like, oh yeah, to buy fuel.
[275:34.57]Fuck.
[275:36.93]It's okay, I'm fine.
[275:37.99]I'm fine.
[275:40.67]Thank god I bought all the stuff I wanted to buy.
[275:42.57]I have a full tank.
[275:43.93]Lava lamps, toasters, and by the way, I also have 75 lava lamps here.
[275:53.68]I don't... It's not a disaster yet.
[276:02.45]I got 5,000 on TeeLo.
[276:03.91]Okay, I can go back to TeeLo.
[276:07.73]What does TeeLo need?
[276:09.17]Actually, no, I need to do this now.
[276:11.26]Who needs anything, really?
[276:14.08]What do I got?
[276:18.70]Mira needs lava lamps.
[276:23.48]TeeLo needs... Okay, I'm going to go to Mira.
[276:27.52]Please don't kill me!
[276:39.50]Good.
[276:40.50]Okay.
[276:42.80]I'm going to make a good sale off this.
[276:49.77]Toasters are fine.
[276:51.03]Okay.
[276:51.93]I'm good.
[276:55.47]Planet Copium.
[277:04.02]I could buy a bunch of toasters and a bunch of moon ferns and head to Tilo.
[277:11.45]How many toasters are here?
[277:19.01]Yeah, I'm going to store them.
[277:24.05]And then I'm going to buy more.
[277:25.05]I need some backup shit here.
[277:27.75]127.
[277:27.79]What else is good there, toasters?
[277:37.99]Babble seeds.
[277:38.49]I'll buy some babble seeds, too.
[277:40.15]They're a little bit more expensive here, but it's okay.
[277:41.79]I'll get a bunch when I go there.
[277:44.99]Okay.
[277:45.33]Totilo, where I'm going to collect money.
[277:48.24]And let's go.
[277:49.08]I can buy exotics, too.
[277:52.68]I could... Exotics are expensive, though.
[278:02.41]Yeah.
[278:04.19]Actually, you know what?
[278:08.68]Let me get rid of... Let me get rid of the babble seeds.
[278:15.54]I have... What?
[278:16.50]How many spawns do I have?
[278:17.36]You know what?
[278:17.72]Let me get rid of... It wasn't a bad deal.
[278:23.93]I paid... What?
[278:25.17]I just bought them!
[278:42.37]OK.
[278:46.11]We're going to Tilo.
[278:50.37]With our.
[278:52.45]Wait, what the fuck is going on?
[278:53.73]What did I just buy?
[278:54.43]OK, yeah, Tilo.
[278:57.64]Alright, let's go.
[279:04.70]Moon ferns.
[279:05.18]The moon ferns don't really give a good return.
[279:09.66]Whatever.
[279:10.16]I don't buy insurance at all.
[279:17.66]Why is your cargo hold so huge when you don't buy enough to fill it?
[279:20.56]What do you mean?
[279:20.94]My cargo hold is 100% filled every time. 160%.
[279:37.07]I pretty much fail this every single time.
[279:41.62]Alright, toasters are worth a good amount here.
[279:46.74]I need the cash, so I'm going to sell the exotics.
[279:52.22]It's a tiny cargo hold.
[279:55.74]Um, that's not bad.
[279:57.06]I mean, if I could stop getting hit by fucking lightning bolts, if I could stop getting hit by crazy shit...
[280:13.12]I just give that guy three to $5,000 every day.
[280:15.62]I'm realizing this now.
[280:17.72]Okay.
[280:22.53]What?
[280:32.51]This is so annoying.
[280:34.47]I spent a hundred thousand dollars on this.
[280:38.81]A hundred and what?
[280:40.03]110,000?
[280:40.25]No one is going to this planet.
[280:44.69]Not even one person.
[280:45.97]People keep going to Loro and I keep making money here.
[280:51.18]Okay.
[280:55.12]Nosh.
[280:55.60]I've got 17 grand at Nosh.
[280:57.16]What is needed in Loro or Nosh?
[281:04.80]Nosh needs exotics.
[281:08.54]Loro needs polyester.
[281:10.68]Okay.
[281:12.96]Let's buy up all the polyester I can and go to Loro.
[281:21.45]Maximum I can buy.
[281:22.45]And we're going to advertise.
[281:26.37]I'm going to put a couple of flyers out there.
[281:32.15]Got plenty of fuel.
[281:33.73]Although it's good because it's cheap now.
[281:35.87]Buy it.

[282:30.04]There's 20,000 waiting for me on Nosh.
[282:33.33]No one has visited Pike at all.
[282:35.37]So we're going to head to Nosh.
[282:37.53]What does Nosh need?
[282:40.33]What do you got Nosh?
[282:42.79]Polyester and gems.
[282:50.56]I could just do a pickup.
[282:56.41]Yeah, we're going to do a advertised passenger pickup.
[283:00.45]I'm going to set the ticket price to $4,000.
[283:23.46]Passenger, look, that's going to be a big deal.
[283:30.49]Back to no debt.
[283:38.96]Everybody's paid.
[283:40.38]All my taxes are paid.
[283:42.32]I'm good.

[284:00.19]Good idea.
[284:05.98]Okay, there are hungo warriors near Oom.
[284:08.98]We're not going there.
[284:09.74]We're good. 20,000.
[284:29.32]And six passengers pick up for four grand.
[284:32.28]That's $24,000.
[284:33.14]We did a $6,000 ad campaign.
[284:36.79]I'm $60,000, no debt.
[284:40.69]Pretty good insurance premium.
[284:43.33]And there's 75 lava lamps in here.
[284:49.95]And they need them.
[284:51.82]I could sell them right now.
[284:53.18]Or we go to Mira with them instead.
[284:58.99]Pay your crew.
[285:05.83]I'm buying insurance this week.
[285:07.25]It's been too good for too long.
[285:14.20]I'll buy up the X-Fuels here.
[285:18.00]In fact, I might even just leave the lava lamps in storage.
[285:24.77]Or... Nah.
[285:25.41]Nah.
[285:28.80]We're selling it here.
[285:34.35]Good.

[285:49.11]I'm good to go.
[285:51.03]The plan is to take these X fuels to Loro.
[285:56.98]I actually might have money on Laurel waiting.
[285:58.88]I do.
[286:02.30]Nothing on Pike at all.
[286:03.84]Head back to Laurel.
[286:09.98]Advertise.
[286:11.74]True.
[286:11.96]I don't have enough money.

[287:18.95]And they're paying $4,000 to pop 12 more thousand.
[287:23.73]I got $138,000 in the bank.
[287:24.41]No debt.
[287:24.59]Insurance is cheap too.
[287:36.63]There's no supply of anything here, is there?
[287:40.65]No.
[287:40.87]I'm going to have to advertise a passenger pickup somewhere else.
[287:50.60]Okay, TLO.
[287:52.36]I got some money on TLO.
[287:53.50]We're going to do a passenger pickup advertisement.

[289:12.48]Wait a minute.
[289:14.40]You stumble into the mental channel of the silent mind buggers.
[289:19.30]Without even boarding your ship, they steal the brains of two of your crew members and melt down your primary navigation circuits, causing $33,000 in damage.
[289:29.36]Luckily, you have insurance.
[289:31.98]Oh.
[289:38.08]Thank God I bought the insurance.
[289:44.12]Uh, it's another 30,000 in damages from the poisonous gas.
[289:52.28]OK, now there's an asteroid.
[289:54.74]Oh, this insurance company is fucking pissed.
[289:58.94]$25,000 more dollars of repairing.
[290:02.62]Thank God you had that insurance.
[290:07.22]Wow.
[290:11.98]That saved everything.
[290:16.52]We're the last ones here, but that's better than losing literally everything.
[290:24.80]Whoa, I'm going to have to, I'm buying insurance again.
[290:28.15]I ain't fucking around, especially if it's less than 3K, I'm buying it every time.
[290:34.45]Okay, what do we got here?
[290:35.95]I have nothing.
[290:37.11]Oh, right, right, right.
[290:39.49]Eight passengers.
[290:41.36]It's 32 grand.
[290:42.20]It was worth it.
[290:44.73]Okay, good.
[290:47.92]Good.
[290:48.24]I have insurance.
[290:50.18]Okay.
[290:53.68]There's a bunch of umbrellas here.
[290:58.26]And we can take the umbrellas to Nosh or to Brack.
[291:05.87]Yeah, umbrellas it is.
[291:09.29]I also might do the passengers again.
[291:17.74]Advertise.
[291:18.28]Yeah, let's do another huge ad campaign.
[291:23.34]For passengers.
[291:25.50]And let's go... We're going to... Iraq.
[291:32.27]So... This game is sick.
[291:34.37]It is, yeah.
[291:34.81]It's fun.
[291:36.79]It's a very simple game.
[291:37.73]There's not a whole lot, you know, to it.
[291:39.59]But I love games that have just little random characters that are... Oh, I...
[291:45.88]Do you do this?
[291:47.16]It could be good.
[291:47.81]It could be bad.
[291:49.05]It's fun.
[291:49.35]Okay.
[291:50.69]I got, we're going to, sorry, I got distracted.
[291:55.69]Rack.
[291:56.13]Okay.
[291:56.41]And I've got a huge ad campaign.
[291:57.95]I've got insurance.
[291:59.01]Let's go.
[292:08.82]This worked out last time.
[292:11.36]Wobbler is back.
[292:13.98]This time wants 25,000.
[292:14.70]Oh, 76,000 again.
[292:23.91]Yeah.
[292:25.25]Oh, nice.
[292:26.17]It feels good.
[292:28.69]Oh, no.
[292:29.21]Hoffmeister got hit by a Lippo Jungi.
[292:34.48]See Mr. Green's Express coming up here.
[292:40.05]We're about to cross over everybody.
[292:42.41]I've now got, I've got, this is going to be huge.
[292:45.59]11 passengers ready to pick up, by the way, for 4,000 each.
[292:49.02]That's 44,000.
[292:50.66]And umbrellas are so badly in demand here that I'm going to make the maximum on 160 tons, which as you all know, is now at $172,000.
[293:14.68]We are doing great.
[293:15.84]And now I have to buy insurance pretty much every single time now.
[293:19.79]If it's under $3,000 or $4,000, I have to do it every time.
[293:23.87]Okay.
[293:25.19]I'm going to take one more break.
[293:27.19]I have a feeling, unless something really bad happens, I stand to be doing pretty well.
[293:34.65]Let me bank most of it.
[293:37.42]Let's do like $140,000.
[293:37.96]I want a little bit.
[293:39.04]So now that'll be giving me what?
[293:45.97]About $3,000 to $4,000 a week in interest.
[293:52.02]Okay, I'll be right back.
[293:53.10]I'm going to go pee.
[293:53.98]I'm going to refill my drink, and I will be right back.
[293:56.44]See you guys in a minute.
[302:00.92]Okay.
[302:01.40]I'm seeing over here in chat somebody saying, hey, let's pretend that there's a loud noise in chat.
[302:10.08]Is there a reason why you're being like this?
[302:16.19]Is there a reason why you're acting like that?
[302:20.95]Hmm.
[302:23.53]Alright.
[302:26.13]So, yeah, we don't have any.
[302:27.45]We need something like chill in the background.
[302:28.90]What's like some chill music we can put on?
[302:31.65]We got... Animal Crossing.
[302:46.20]Club Penguin.
[302:48.89]Club Penguin's a pretty good one.
[302:50.01]I feel like we've done that a lot before, though.
[302:54.93]Um...
[303:01.94]Club Penguin OST.
[303:03.44]Let's see.
[303:03.84]I'll tell you guys, I'm getting into the, you know, more of a chill streamer where you can just keep me on like a second monitor and then, you know, we talk with low volume.
[303:22.05]I'm not going to get too crazy.
[303:25.43]I could never be one of those streamers because, uh, my decibel of my voice
[303:32.11]So like, I will be fine for an hour and I could talk like this for an hour, but the second that a meteor hits my ship, I'm not going to go, Oh no, a meteor hit the ship.
[303:41.64]You know me, I'm going to go.
[303:42.62]And then you're going to wake up.
[303:46.20]You're going to have one of those big fucking sleeping hats on the sleeping caps on.
[303:49.80]And you're gonna be pissed.
[303:53.98]Alright.

[312:00.97]Shit.
[312:01.48]Wait.
[312:03.20]If I go to Pike, collect the money, and then buy a bunch of exotics, and then fly back to Nosh, collect the money from Nosh.
[312:12.16]Okay.
[312:15.40]Yeah.

[312:53.30]Sorry about that loud scream that you heard there.
[312:57.40]What the fuck is going on?
[312:58.80]What am I hearing?
[313:06.71]That's so annoying.
[313:13.31]Well...
[313:17.63]I need to buy umbrellas and take the umbrellas to Brack.
[313:29.75]I guess.
[313:36.68]What else does Brack need?
[313:40.18]Diapers and hair tonic.
[313:51.44]I have so much money.
[313:52.22]I'm so afraid of this.
[313:53.46]Already got passengers.
[313:58.21]Let's do an advertising campaign for commodities.
[314:00.39]We're going to do flyers.
[314:04.11]On to frack.
[314:05.78]Deposit this money.
[314:22.34]Hmm.
[314:23.10]33,000.

[314:31.72]Taxes are going up a lot.
[314:37.00]Okay.
[314:37.94]There's 14 passengers to pick up here too.
[314:40.24]Holy shit.

[315:18.93]I need to go to Nosh for gas.
[315:21.37]How much money do I got on Nosh right now?
[315:22.67]Alright, I got money on Nosh.
[315:24.67]I'm gonna go Nosh, then Pike.
[315:25.81]Alright, what does Nosh need?
[315:28.13]We ask that question every time, don't we?
[315:31.20]Cryptunes and lava lamps.
[315:36.16]I think I can swing that.
[315:51.76]With ship, you can get groceries delivered same day.
[315:55.22]I don't want any one of these ads.
[316:05.33]Okay.
[316:06.61]Do I dare?
[316:07.77]Okay, I gotta go to Nosh.
[316:09.69]I've got my shit.
[316:11.51]I'm making the passenger pickup.
[316:14.91]Is... Is it gonna be pretty greedy?
[316:17.15]Because it's already a lot of money.
[316:19.06]But...
[316:20.39]We're Mr. Green's Express, of course.
[316:23.58]$4,500 for the next round trip.
[316:24.86]Alright, ask for lower premiums.
[316:35.43]Ooh, you reduced my rate by 11%, so now it's $18,000 instead of $20,000.
[316:38.25]Wow.
[316:38.39]Don't go to Mira.
[316:39.21]And, uh-oh.
[316:51.42]Don't go to Nosh.
[316:52.02]Should I go to Pike instead?
[316:58.50]Do we pivot to Pike?
[317:03.21]Or should I go to... I'll go to Tilo.
[317:06.15]Because I can sell the cryptins in Tilo.
[317:10.29]Oh, wait.
[317:10.69]Insurance.
[317:13.29]Let's go.
[317:13.79]Alright.
[317:18.09]I got big money.
[317:19.40]You bet your ass I'm buying this.
[317:23.62]This is to have a. OK, so it's 2300 times and he lands on Mira.
[317:29.10]You go to Mira all the time.
[317:38.90]65 K.
[317:43.54]200 K. What are you talking about?
[317:45.36]That's only if it was like five or 6000 maybe.
[317:47.74]That's low balling.
[317:52.00]Is it really?
[317:55.98]You want me to spend more than $125,000?
[317:56.70]I'll do 100K.
[317:56.90]I'm willing to do 100K.
[317:57.60]You just added the premium back.
[318:06.81]Okay, whatever.
[318:23.12]Puffer is accused of selling stolen goods.
[318:25.66]See, I did that last time and it ruined everything.
[318:28.87]Serves you right.
[318:32.91]God damn it.
[318:35.95]Should have done 120.
[318:37.87]I had 125 in there and you all told me to take it away.
[318:40.21]Alright, I need better fuel prices, please.
[318:54.62]I'd like to spin, please.
[318:58.74]God damn it.
[319:09.65]I advertised.
[319:11.83]Yes, I did.
[319:12.23]No, I'm not.
[319:13.29]Everybody wants me to start a business.
[319:26.79]How's your online business going?
[319:28.17]Starting a business?
[319:29.27]Hey, how are you doing?
[319:30.65]Wait, I'm doing the planet shit.
[319:32.41]Is it just like listening to me talk?
[319:37.25]I keep talking about how I'm... Come on.
[319:42.00]Come on.
[319:43.18]That was like three ads in a row about starting a business.
[319:46.18]And I'm sitting here talking about my business, how my business is losing money.
[319:49.48]I owe fucking $500,000.
[319:50.18]Oh my God.
[319:56.14]You know what?
[319:56.82]Fuck this.
[319:59.22]Fuck that.
[320:00.44]Fuck this.
[320:02.12]Dog food.
[320:03.82]Yeah, I got a couple.
[320:05.37]Yeah, guys, I got two new dogs.
[320:09.63]I got three new dogs, and then honestly, like, I'm thinking about getting ten dogs.
[320:14.51]How am I gonna feed that many dogs?
[320:17.59]There's no way, right?
[320:22.01]Because if you think about if I have 25 dogs, I'm going to need a ton of dog food to feed those 25 dogs.
[320:28.91]And it's got to be healthy.
[320:30.71]Here are some things that I really care about in regards to how I feel about, you know, pet food.
[320:36.65]I want my pet food to be natural and not have grain be the first ingredient.
[320:41.45]Not have grains be the first ingredient in my pet food for my 25 dogs.
[320:48.81]I am very conscious about that.
[320:51.13]As you all know.
[320:52.96]How many people are here right now?
[320:55.12]There are about 17,000 people here right now.
[320:59.00]All of us just waiting to hear about something that could be happening with dogs and pet food.
[321:05.11]But I don't know.
[321:06.19]I've got some money to spend.
[321:07.29]I think my annual budget for dog food... Well, I'm crunching the numbers right now.
[321:12.97]My annual budget for dog food is probably $600,000 to $700,000.
[321:18.16]Maybe a little bit more.
[321:19.34]I haven't done the math totally yet, but I have a lot of money to spend in regards to dog food.
[321:23.85]Buying tons of shit for my dogs.
[321:28.71]Yeah.
[321:31.63]Anybody else here have a dog?
[321:34.39]Like, press 1 in the chat if you have a dog.
[321:35.91]There's a lot of people here that have dog people, I think.
[321:42.67]That's about a million dollars I have to spend on dog food.
[321:46.53]Dog food!
[321:48.33]Dog food!
[321:48.85]Yeah, there's a lot of ones in chat.
[321:56.11]You know, actually, you know what?
[321:56.97]I think I'm going to get a couple of fucking parrots, too.
[322:00.64]How do you feed parrots?
[322:02.68]And five cats?
[322:09.74]Yeah, you know what?
[322:10.50]There's going to be 50 dogs at my property.
[322:15.07]Yeah, I think so.
[322:22.40]I think we're in an Airheads commercial.
[322:25.40]I don't want to feed him Airheads.
[322:28.08]This is why we never get anything done.
[322:30.07]Oh, no.
[322:41.05]Oh, it's Christmas.
[322:42.49]Can you believe it?
[322:45.33]What?
[322:46.29]What do you guys think Santa's going to bring you this year?
[322:53.06]Okay, what the hell are we doing?
[322:58.36]Merry Christmas.
[323:00.46]Merry Christmas.
[323:01.64]I love dogs.
[323:02.60]Merry Christmas.
[323:03.76]Every dog in America, in Europe, in China, in Japan, in every country that I have viewers.
[323:17.81]That's the only places where anybody watches this channel, apparently.
[323:25.18]I need to buy fuel.
[323:36.88]Wait, so the dog's not going to be a thing.
[323:38.79]OK, I need to let's buy fuel.
[323:44.57]Come on.
[323:46.95]31% don't fill my tank is going to be like $100,000.
[323:53.19]1500 per ton.
[323:54.15]How many tons do I need?
[324:02.66]That's too much, I think.
[324:05.58]It's not worth it.
[324:06.64]That's a lot.
[324:07.52]I can't fill it.
[324:08.16]It's like 100.
[324:08.42]No, I'm not doing it.
[324:10.08]I'm going to run out of gas and we're all going to die.
[324:18.19]And it's because I just didn't feel like doing that.
[324:20.87]I have enough.
[324:21.43]There's like another two trips.
[324:24.47]I have insurance now, don't worry.
[324:29.87]OK, we're going to make a ton of money on the lava lamps and the crypt tunes.
[324:35.39]Sounds good to me.
[324:38.58]Nice look at all this.
[324:41.66]Oh, we are swimming in money.
[324:48.78]No passengers here, why not?
[325:00.60]Alright, I got 10,000 coming in a week.
[325:06.93]No taxes owed.
[325:08.05]I got some money.
[325:09.95]Okay.

[325:16.51]T-Low.
[325:18.41]Okay, I want to go to Pike.
[325:20.69]There was some bad shit going on in Pike, right?
[325:22.53]I don't want to do that.
[325:28.34]Whether... Okay, frack is bad.
[325:31.54]Don't go to frack.
[325:33.74]Okay.
[325:36.23]What do they need on, like, gems?
[325:41.25]I'm gonna buy... It's a bad return, but at least it's something.
[325:46.63]It's gonna be very, very expensive.
[325:49.24]But I got the money.
[325:51.74]I'm good for it.
[325:52.70]I'll make way more.
[326:08.96]Okay, let's go to Pike.
[326:14.24]This music is terrible for my brain.
[326:16.08]Why?

[326:37.67]That's not a dog food commercial.
[326:40.64]That's nothing to do with dog food.
[326:43.30]I got a political ad.
[326:51.58]Okay, well.
[326:54.64]That's not a dog food one.

[347:58.03]I'm on beginner difficulty, by the way.
[347:59.67]Can you imagine how hard this does get?
[348:02.15]You got to be perfect.
[348:05.99]What's the end game here?
[348:08.77]I need to get to 5 million.

[348:21.36]Anything?
[348:21.64]Okay, I'm going to buy a bunch of whipped cream.
[348:24.56]And where am I going to go from here?
[348:26.06]I need to go to Pike.
[348:30.32]What does Pike have or need?
[348:33.16]Not a whole lot of anything, honestly.
[348:34.60]I think I'm just going to do a passenger pickup thing.
[348:36.53]Let's do another $10,000 ad.
[348:38.25]Because I make $52,000 every time.
[348:40.31]Ooh.
[348:55.52]I mean, I don't I have 12,000.
[348:56.44]Oh, it's because I'm doing both.
[349:01.32]Right?
[349:01.50]I was doing both.
[349:02.54]Let's do 2000 on here.
[349:06.56]Newspaper and radio.
[349:08.68]That's like that.
[349:10.98]Okay.
[349:14.10]Okay.
[349:16.68]We're going to pike.
[349:19.58]Yes!
[349:20.12]Okay, I need this.
[349:21.26]Traders, 200 ton ship upgrade to the highest bidder.
[349:29.88]I'm thinking $250,000.
[349:30.34]I might even do $300,000.
[349:30.86]$250,000 or $300,000.
[349:30.96]I have $800,000.
[349:31.26]Okay.
[349:45.29]That's way too much.
[349:46.91]Way too much, you think?
[349:48.05]I don't know.
[349:49.53]What if I don't have it right?
[349:51.03]This could make or break the rest of the whole entire game for me.
[349:56.47]250, you think?
[349:58.21]I don't feel secure.
[350:04.04]The last one went for 100 and something thousand.
[350:13.66]Okay, I'm doing $250.

[350:25.57]That's a lot of money.
[350:32.65]It's... I just did it.
[350:34.17]Okay, $270,000.
[350:34.43]Somebody is firing something.
[350:43.87]Uh-oh.
[350:47.79]A band of space pirates who happen to be descendants of the infamous Bro Nap Good Shark overtake your ship.
[350:55.95]Unable to find any cargo to steal, they wind up playing around with your navigation controls, drinking all your beverages, and generally making a mess.
[351:04.26]Oh, I don't care.
[351:08.88]Come on, we don't care about this.
[351:14.33]I overpaid by $200,000.
[351:15.33]I overpaid by $200,000.
[351:16.07]Oh boy.
[351:18.31]Wow.

[351:21.07]I could afford it.
[351:21.77]I could afford it.

[361:45.34]Falling behind.

[362:39.99]No, we're good.
[362:43.31]Oom.
[362:45.75]We haven't been to Oom in a long time.
[362:59.78]Good.
[363:02.80]Due to labor unrest and strikes across Umbra, supply of manufacturers temporarily runs short.
[363:06.98]Prices soar as diapers, umbrellas, toasters, polyester, hair tonic, and lava lamps become hard to find.
[363:11.64]Oh my god.
[363:20.16]This is gonna be a lot.
[363:35.47]15 passengers.
[363:37.44]That's 60,000.

[364:25.65]Oh, no, it's the wait, wait, wait, wait.
[364:32.30]Whipped cream is the most I can the best return, I think.
[364:40.67]Um is known throughout the galaxy as the fortune teller's planet.
[364:43.93]This is because the soothsayers of Um have the uncanny ability to predict the future by scanning one's aura of positive or negative energy.
[364:54.91]It's 10,000.
[364:55.15]Yeah, let's go.
[365:00.76]Why advertise for me to do that?
[365:04.68]What was the point of that?
[365:08.43]Alright, we need to take the whipped cream to Loro.
[365:12.97]Pause it all this.
[365:20.62]Did I advertise already?
[365:21.56]I did, right?
[365:24.83]Yes, I did.
[365:29.31]Click on the column in the supply to put an icon on the map to where you've decided to go so you don't have to remember, please.
[365:35.89]Click on the column in the supply.
[365:37.70]Uh-oh.
[365:40.40]Oh, great.
[365:41.60]Oh.
[365:42.84]Nice.
[365:44.90]Good thing I did it.
[365:47.88]Yeah, I had a feeling.
[365:48.92]I had a pretty bad feeling.
[365:56.07]Again, another one of these triples.
[366:01.69]I'm glad I decided to do it.
[366:04.45]Oh shit, I think it's over.
[366:06.56]Thousand tons?
[366:07.52]Yeah, it's over.
[366:11.76]I'll play it out, but it's definitely over. 40,000...
[366:32.79]good okay whipped cream thank you buy all the exotics I can afford here and what else you got x fuels buy all the x fuels I can afford and all the cryptunes
[367:02.06]That works for me.
[367:04.52]Alright.
[367:04.94]So you're saying in the supply is a column saying where's the column saying there's a column somewhere.
[367:26.86]Let's go gambling.
[367:34.21]I have not made any money gambling at all.
[367:39.36]Call them with the planet names on the supply menu.
[367:41.50]Oh, I can mark that.
[367:49.54]Oh, I see.
[367:50.40]Hey, it only took me until the end of the stream to do it.
[368:01.79]Do you like scallops?
[368:03.47]Yeah, they're okay.
[368:09.05]Jerma, I'm really high.
[368:10.07]What is going on?
[368:11.65]Take a little less.
[368:13.67]Take a little less.
[368:15.37]I would say.
[368:18.39]What are you doing?
[368:23.94]You like shallots.
[368:25.10]Nah.
[368:28.36]No, gross.
[368:34.46]Took you eight years of streaming to discover that gambling is bad.
[368:39.97]Tell that to Mr. Grains.
[368:41.89]He made seven billion limes.
[368:45.25]Alright, alright, alright.
[368:46.13]Let me pay back attention.
[368:46.83]Alright, so I need to go to... We're going back to frack with our ex-fuels and our exotics.

[369:13.41]The latest below me was 190.
[369:14.11]220. 220.
[369:33.01]You don't need it?
[369:34.27]Wait, doesn't it... Is it not adding 200 tons?
[369:36.71]Don't you already have... I think it's adding an extra 200.
[369:42.16]I hope it was.
[369:51.20]I should have done 250.
[369:52.73]Money, money, money.
[369:56.37]This is awesome.
[369:57.75]Oh, no.
[369:59.25]Oh, no.

[370:40.42]And somebody is very close.
[370:48.92]Uh, advertise.
[370:50.00]Uh, I could buy the sans polyester and then take it to Pike and then buy an upgrade if I can.
[370:59.49]Google sans polyester.
[371:06.95]Okay.
[371:08.75]And we are going to Pike.
[371:11.57]Please not end the stream voice.
[371:14.16]I think it's been long enough.
[371:17.88]That's a lot of money.
[371:24.26]Yeah.
[371:26.02]I'll take another.
[371:27.17]Wow.

[371:38.14]I just made the most money I think I've ever made.
[371:44.10]I'm about to cross a million.
[371:47.45]We're going to bump up the advertising even more.
[371:58.09]Give me a 13 co-op engine.
[372:00.78]Oh, whatever.
[372:01.20]Okay.
[372:04.16]Okay.
[372:07.19]What should I, where am I going?
[372:10.23]Umbrellas.

[372:38.47]Another one of these bids.
[372:39.97]No, fuck it.
[372:40.65]I don't want anything to do with it.
[372:42.19]That's bad.
[372:44.57]$70,000 in a meteor storm.
[372:50.88]That sucks.
[372:51.16]Okay.
[372:51.38]Okay.
[373:09.37]64.
[373:20.98]If I can keep this going.
[373:23.12]I love how invested he is.
[373:26.56]Even though he has been dead last this entire time, there's no chance of him ever winning.
[373:30.98]There's a chance of me getting over a million dollars.
[373:34.22]You kidding me?
[373:35.54]There's a chance that I might get over a million dollars.
[373:37.68]I don't care if I lose.
[373:39.26]The competition's better than me.
[373:40.28]I'm talking about a million.
[373:51.93]Okay.
[373:53.53]Where am I going?
[373:59.45]Polyester, bring it to Pike and buy another upgrade.

[375:37.35]44,000.
[375:37.79]You just charged me 1,000 to do the same job a week ago.
[375:45.29]No.
[375:45.39]Not worth it.
[376:01.18]Okay.
[376:02.46]Where am I going?
[376:05.48]Lava lamps to nosh.
[376:10.05]That is... Shit.

[376:23.46]Lava lamps to nosh, right?
[376:24.78]Yep.
[376:35.60]Remember for the last time, shut up.
[376:38.78]Uh, you're on a live stream.
[376:44.20]Where there's a live streamer talking.
[376:48.04]What are you talking about?
[376:49.42]Give me a break.
[376:54.04]I'm an exceptional merchant, I'm okay with that.
[377:01.52]Give me the gas.
[377:06.42]Yep, build a tank.
[377:10.46]I have to get to a million.
[377:11.38]If I get to a million, I'm happy.
[377:21.97]Advertise?
[377:22.65]I'm just living in my own little world over here.
[377:25.49]It's fine.
[377:27.83]Okay, now where do I want to go?
[377:32.51]Exotics to frack would be okay.
[377:38.39]Polyester to pike.
[377:39.57]Let's do polyester to pike.
[377:48.08]What else can I do at pike?
[377:51.64]Moon ferns.
[377:55.14]We can do babble seeds.
[378:02.17]Alright, let's go.
[378:06.07]Laughing my ass off.
[378:07.05]It's been six hours.
[378:09.91]Oh no.
[378:10.99]Come on.
[378:16.39]Yeah, it's over.
[378:18.74]Broke is at 3.8 million.
[378:20.48]One more million and that's it.
[378:22.96]It's completely out of reach now.
[378:26.26]But it was fun.
[378:29.40]This is on beginner, which is crazy.
[378:37.42]I just want to get to a million.
[378:41.36]Matt, almost $900,000?
[378:45.46]Yeah, I'll go gamble.
[378:46.45]Don't worry.
[378:47.09]You better believe I'm going to take $100,000.
[378:48.15]I'm going to go bet like $50,000 to $100,000.
[378:51.43]The insurance.
[378:58.97]Alright.
[378:59.35]What do you got?
[378:59.92]You've got gems.
[379:02.26]I'll take them.
[379:04.16]Wait.
[379:04.92]No, that's too expensive.
[379:07.27]Oxygen.
[379:07.81]I'll buy all the oxygen.
[379:10.21]How we doing?
[379:17.33]Look at how much money is on TLO for me.
[379:19.09]Alright, we're going to head back to TLO.
[379:23.52]That'll get us over a million.
[379:24.54]I need to advertise.
[379:29.58]Pause it.
[379:30.76]Back to TLO.
[379:38.78]Okay, we are about to lose.
[379:42.28]But... You know what's on my side?
[379:45.76]I'll tell you what's on my side.
[379:52.86]I have 1.02 million dollars.
[380:07.88]The owner of one of the major casinos on Tilo died last night.
[380:11.34]And all the casinos have shut down for a week.
[380:13.77]To pay their respects.
[380:17.29]I'm sitting outside with a briefcase full of a million dollars in it.
[380:21.77]They could have taken everything from me.
[380:23.01]They could have taken a million dollars if they were open today.
[380:30.64]Well, uh...
[380:35.47]I guess I'm gonna just turn around and come back?
[380:43.75]What do you got here?
[380:44.47]Okay.
[380:48.58]Ooglesands to Oom and then Oom to Tilo.
[380:52.46]Sounds good to me.
[380:57.96]Do not just walk around with a million dollars in your pocket.
[381:01.10]That would be stupid.
[381:07.59]Sleep outside the building, yeah.
[381:09.33]Alright, give me some knowledge for 10 grand.
[381:22.02]The soothsayer performs a series of readings and comes to the conclusion that your aura is slightly on the negative side.
[381:29.28]But this is nothing to worry about.
[381:30.60]Thanks, here's $10,000.
[381:40.83]I'm taking in $30,000 a week.
[381:49.34]Thank you.
[381:51.58]Alright.
[381:53.86]I'm going to buy exotics and we're going back to TLO.
[382:05.99]Buy exotics.
[382:07.67]What else is at TLO?
[382:11.57]Diapers.
[382:13.35]Buy some diapers.
[382:18.11]Okay.
[382:21.77]Deposit.
[382:25.05]I've got my million dollars in my bank.
[382:31.37]Do I buy like a million dollars worth of stock?
[382:35.79]Okay.
[382:37.07]Back to Tilo.
[382:41.08]I don't want anything to do with this.
[382:42.22]Go ahead.
[382:42.58]Good luck.
[382:50.90]Was that the fart sound?
[382:52.13]That was the default fart noise.
[382:57.73]Your ship's trusty engineer discovers a leak in your main fuel tank.
[383:01.19]Lumbor manages to quickly stop the leak.
[383:03.03]However, by this time, half of your fuel is gone.
[383:04.99]The only thing that matters is we're here.
[383:13.78]Okay.
[383:17.86]I need to get to 5 million.
[383:21.08]So here's what we're going to do.
[383:26.55]I'm going to bet $53,000.
[383:27.05]Take out a huge loan.
[383:42.39]I can't take out a huge loan guys.
[383:45.71]This is just you can only gamble 5% of your total money.
[383:48.88]So what needs to happen is I need to win like 10.
[383:52.22]I need to win like 20 times in a row.
[384:01.84]Wait.
[384:04.42]No one's allowed to get more than 5% of their total cash.
[384:06.60]What's 5% of a million?
[384:08.26]Is it 50,000?
[384:14.36]I think that is... Yeah, that's it.
[384:17.48]Okay.
[384:20.87]Fuck you.
[384:27.11]Shit.
[384:30.17]I'm going to buy insurance and then I'm going to just drive around the... Okay, it's over.
[384:34.03]I lose.
[384:44.97]I don't think I can't buy and sell enough to win.
[384:52.39]Fill up my tank, alright.
[384:57.42]Put it into stocks.
[385:01.58]There's only one share available for me to even buy.
[385:04.08]Wait, can I just buy like 1000 shares?
[385:09.60]Where am I?
[385:10.02]I'm on TLO.
[385:10.88]Where's TLO?
[385:12.18]TLO is going wild right now.
[385:26.44]Okay.
[385:28.64]The reason why they did it like this is so you can't just go gamble a million dollars and make like five million dollars in ten seconds.
[385:38.58]Watch me.
[385:43.18]What is it, Mr. Toe?
[385:44.72]Whoopsie-daisy.
[385:50.16]What is it, Mr. Otto?
[385:55.62]He's just sitting over here, yeah.
[385:57.42]He's chilling.
[385:59.74]Alright.
[386:00.18]It's time to go back to Tilo.
[386:01.38]I already lost.
[386:02.04]The game is over.
[386:04.68]But let's see what happens here.
[386:12.05]Things are just burning down.
[386:13.15]My warehouses are burning down.
[386:14.87]Insurance is going up.
[386:17.51]Shit is falling apart.
[386:18.43]But.
[386:19.17]But.
[386:19.77]But.
[386:28.76]Okay.
[386:30.22]Big deal.
[386:32.40]Big deal.
[386:34.80]If we just have to win.
[386:35.97]How many of these do we have to win?
[386:38.13]So this would go to 100,000.
[386:38.71]Double of nothing would go to 200.
[386:40.27]200 would go to 400.
[386:40.83]4 would go to 8.
[386:41.13]8 would go to 1.6.
[386:42.39]1.6 would go to... How many times do I have to win this?
[386:43.97]In a row.
[386:44.15]7 times.
[386:59.95]That's one.
[387:00.43]That's one time.
[387:03.67]Who cares?
[387:13.86]Who cares?
[387:15.22]It was fun while it lasted.
[387:16.74]I'm just gonna buy up all the gems.
[387:24.31]And then all the... Cryptoons.
[387:29.73]And then we're going to just play it out.
[387:35.15]We're going to go to Oom with our gems.
[387:39.39]I want to take a look at how things are.
[387:42.48]Whatever.
[387:42.92]Okay, you're our favorite snail guy.
[387:47.52]Hey, thanks.
[387:48.88]Yeah, that's it.
[387:51.64]Roke needs literally 20 grand.
[387:54.78]Watch him get hit by a meteor.
[387:58.14]The Nosh exchange is in a state of utter confusion as investors pack the floor, scrambling to sell their shares.
[388:04.76]Some investors have been hiring spaceships at exorbitant prices just to make it there in time to sell off their investments.
[388:12.31]What happened?
[388:23.09]Oof.
[388:25.37]Oh boy, that's bad.
[388:29.96]Wait, what?
[388:33.34]Oh, shit.
[388:33.96]It's all the way down here.
[388:39.59]Even the rock-solid Tilo market was rattled by that news.
[388:52.33]Okay, I'll pay that.
[388:55.31]Pick up a passenger.
[388:56.95]And we're going to congratulate... We're going to...
[389:01.44]Wait a minute.
[389:04.14]Oh, wow.
[389:08.07]Sell everything.
[389:09.09]We're going to congratulate the next person.
[389:12.83]Did a wonderful job.
[389:15.23]I will just sell my exotics.
[389:18.03]I did make it over a million.
[389:19.41]That was not quite enough.
[389:22.64]Alright, everybody.
[389:23.34]Say congratulations because it's over.
[389:24.92]Nobody cares about this.
[389:26.84]Game's over.
[389:33.68]Uh, that's fine.
[389:36.02]I'll take the $100,000 hit.
[389:39.73]What?
[389:40.19]A free ship?
[389:42.79]5 million.
[389:43.47]There it is.
[389:44.87]Roke Transport won the game at the end of the last week by being the first company in 74 weeks to reach 5 million kubars.
[389:56.40]Look at how everyone's having so much fun.
[389:57.84]Can I just pretend to be on their team?
[390:05.65]Big news on the financial front.
[390:06.91]Broke Transport has gotten to 5 million.
[390:11.35]Go down in history.
[390:13.39]Very wonderful.
[390:14.05]This is an honor few ever receive.
[390:16.63]Congratulations.
[390:19.82]Even though you lost, it's not the end.
[390:21.14]If you keep playing, a new winning point will be established, allowing you a chance to redeem yourself.
[390:27.08]The Nosh Exchange is still crashing.
[390:32.55]I love this a broad-based loss of confidence in the nosh exchange has led to a major crash its board of trustees is begging investors to hold on to their shares but no one seems to be willing to take that chance wait what puffer bid did they buy nosh the planet they bought the planet
[391:03.29]For $200,000?
[391:07.31]Are you kidding me?
[391:10.27]Well, that's interesting.
[391:13.18]Alright, that's going to be it.
[391:14.66]I had fun.
[391:15.32]It was fun playing this and chilling.
[391:16.88]I've actually had this in my Steam library.
[391:18.66]It's been there for a long time, so...
[391:22.91]Post-game content?
[391:23.95]Yeah, you can keep going.
[391:26.03]You can also play this with other people.
[391:28.59]So, hot seat, kind of hot seat style.
[391:32.98]You can just kind of, you know, bring everybody into the room and everybody can make deals and trades and agreements.
[391:39.50]It'd be kind of fun, actually, with like four or five people just messing around.
[391:46.44]But there it is.
[391:46.96]There's Gazillionaire.
[391:48.62]I'm going to go... Wait, do you need to go outside?
[391:50.70]What's going on?
[391:52.31]Can you sense
[391:53.77]He needs something.
[391:54.81]I'm going to take care of him.
[391:57.17]Yeah, that was fun.
[391:59.43]I will see you guys probably... I think Ster and I want to play Bingo.
[392:04.47]We have that second Bingo board to do.
[392:06.99]So that's... I've got to talk to Ster, because I know Ster's playing a lot of PoE.
[392:11.77]And I was checking it out, too.
[392:12.83]The new league seems pretty interesting.
[392:14.46]I was thinking about putting a little time in it.
[392:17.92]But I know that Ster is very much into PoE right now.
[392:22.90]But regardless, just keep an ear on the ground because at some point we're either going to do EDF or bingo.
[392:33.24]So I'll just, I'll talk to him after the stream and see what's going on.
[392:37.32]But yeah, you will see at least EDF and maybe bingo tomorrow.
[392:41.62]If not, then we'll put something on the book for EDF or something.
[392:48.12]Alright, I'll see you guys later.
[392:49.62]Take it easy.
[392:50.75]Have a good one.
[392:51.43]Around what time?
[392:53.41]That's a good question.
[392:56.17]Probably around, like, same time today?
[392:57.97]Like, around, like, 1 to 3?
[393:01.79]I'll talk to him tonight and see what we're gonna do.
[393:04.87]Okay.
[393:05.71]Okay, Ato.
[393:06.47]Let's go.
[393:08.06]Alright, guys.
[393:08.52]Take it easy.
[393:08.98]Thanks for watching.
[393:09.72]See you guys soon.
[393:10.96]Call your mother.
[393:11.66]You know.
[393:11.88]You know the drill.
